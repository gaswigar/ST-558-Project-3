say
is
it
fate
that
has
flung
us
together
we
who
from
life
varied
pathways
thus
meet
it
was
a
broiling
day
at
the
end
of
july
and
the
railway
station
at
tiverton
junction
was
crowded
with
passengers
porters
wheeling
great
truckfuls
of
luggage
strove
to
force
a
way
along
the
thronged
platform
anxious
mothers
held
restless
children
firmly
by
the
hand
harassed
fathers
sought
to
pack
their
families
into
already
overflowing
compartments
excited
cyclists
were
endeavouring
to
disentangle
their
machines
from
among
the
piles
of
boxes
and
portmanteaus
a
circus
and
a
theatrical
company
were
loud
in
their
lamentations
for
certain
reserved
corridor
carriages
which
had
not
arrived
while
a
patient
band
of
teachers
was
struggling
to
keep
together
a
large
party
of
slum
children
bound
for
a
camp
the
noise
was
almost
unbearable
the
ceaseless
whistling
of
the
engines
the
shouts
of
the
porters
the
banging
of
carriage
doors
the
eager
inquiries
of
countless
perplexed
passengers
made
a
combination
calculated
to
give
a
headache
to
the
owner
of
the
stoutest
nerves
and
to
drive
timid
travellers
to
distraction
all
the
world
seemed
off
for
its
holiday
and
the
bustle
and
confusion
of
its
departure
was
nearly
enough
to
make
some
parents
wish
they
had
stayed
at
home
leaning
up
against
the
bookstall
in
a
corner
out
of
reach
of
the
stream
of
traffic
clutching
a
basket
in
one
hand
and
a
full
of
wraps
and
umbrellas
in
the
other
stood
a
small
girl
of
about
ten
or
eleven
years
of
age
her
gaze
fixed
anxiously
upon
the
great
clock
on
the
platform
opposite
she
was
a
pretty
child
with
a
sweet
thoughtful
little
face
clear
gray
eyes
and
straight
fair
hair
which
fell
over
her
shoulders
without
the
least
attempt
at
wave
or
curl
she
was
very
simply
and
plainly
dressed
her
sailor
suit
had
been
many
times
to
the
laundry
the
straw
hat
was
decidedly
sunburnt
and
her
boots
had
evidently
seen
good
service
but
there
was
about
her
an
indescribable
air
of
refinement
and
good
breeding
that
intangible
something
which
stamps
those
trained
from
their
babyhood
in
gentle
ways
which
set
her
apart
at
once
from
the
crowds
of
cheap
trippers
that
thronged
the
station
from
the
eager
glances
she
cast
up
and
down
the
platform
she
appeared
to
be
waiting
for
somebody
and
she
tried
to
beguile
the
time
by
watching
the
surging
mass
of
tourists
who
hurried
past
her
in
a
ceaseless
stream
she
had
listened
while
the
circus
manager
the
superintendent
and
excitedly
proclaimed
his
woes
she
had
held
her
breath
with
interest
when
the
slum
babies
with
their
buns
and
parcels
were
successfully
bundled
into
the
compartments
reserved
for
them
and
had
craned
her
neck
to
catch
a
last
glimpse
as
they
steamed
slowly
out
of
the
station
their
small
faces
filling
the
windows
like
groups
of
cherubs
and
their
shrill
little
voices
all
the
other
noise
and
din
as
they
joined
lustily
in
the
chorus
of
a
hymn
she
had
witnessed
the
struggles
of
several
family
parties
to
secure
seats
the
altercation
between
the
young
man
with
the
bernard
dog
and
the
guard
who
refused
to
allow
it
in
the
carriage
the
wrath
of
the
gentleman
whose
was
broken
the
grief
of
the
lady
whose
were
missing
and
the
despair
of
the
young
couple
whose
baby
had
gone
on
in
the
train
then
growing
rather
weary
of
the
throng
she
turned
her
eyes
to
the
bookstall
and
tried
to
amuse
herself
with
admiring
the
large
coloured
supplements
which
adorned
the
back
or
reading
the
names
of
the
rows
of
attractive
books
and
periodicals
which
were
spread
forth
in
tempting
array
she
was
fumbling
in
her
pocket
and
wondering
whether
she
would
spend
a
certain
cherished
penny
on
an
illustrated
paper
or
keep
it
for
a
more
urgent
occasion
when
her
attention
was
aroused
by
a
pair
of
who
strolled
in
a
leisurely
fashion
up
to
the
bookstall
and
standing
close
beside
her
began
to
turn
over
some
of
the
various
magazines
and
journals
they
were
a
tall
lady
carrying
a
tiny
white
under
her
arm
and
a
little
girl
of
about
her
own
age
a
child
who
appeared
so
charmingly
pretty
to
isobel
eyes
that
she
could
not
help
gazing
at
her
in
admiration
an
older
and
more
practised
observer
would
have
noticed
that
the
newcomer
face
lacked
character
and
that
her
claims
to
beauty
lay
mostly
in
her
dainty
colouring
and
her
curling
flaxen
hair
and
would
have
decided
moreover
that
the
white
japanese
silk
dress
the
drawn
chiffon
hat
with
its
garland
of
flowers
the
tall
white
french
kid
boots
the
tiny
gold
bangles
and
the
jewelled
locket
seemed
more
suitable
for
a
garden
party
or
a
walk
on
the
promenade
than
for
the
dust
and
dirt
of
a
crowded
railway
journey
to
isobel
however
she
appeared
like
an
enchanted
princess
in
a
fairy
story
and
she
looked
on
with
thrilling
interest
while
the
attractive
stranger
made
her
choice
among
the
supply
of
literature
provided
for
the
wants
of
the
travelling
public
she
seemed
somewhat
difficult
to
satisfy
for
she
threw
down
one
magazine
after
another
in
a
rather
disdainful
fashion
declaring
that
none
of
them
looked
worth
reading
and
calling
to
the
assistant
bade
him
show
her
some
a
goodly
pile
of
these
was
handed
down
for
her
inspection
and
isobel
who
stood
almost
at
her
elbow
could
see
over
her
shoulder
as
she
turned
the
pages
so
endless
was
the
variety
of
delightful
tales
and
illustrations
from
legends
of
king
arthur
or
the
red
cross
knight
to
middle
age
mysteries
or
modern
adventures
and
school
scrapes
that
it
should
not
have
been
hard
to
find
something
to
suit
any
taste
and
the
little
girl
in
the
sailor
hat
looked
on
so
fascinated
with
the
snatches
she
was
able
to
read
that
she
did
not
notice
when
a
lady
in
black
came
hurrying
up
until
the
latter
touched
her
on
the
arm
why
mother
dear
at
last
did
you
think
i
was
lost
darling
i
had
such
terrible
difficulty
to
get
a
porter
and
the
brown
box
had
been
put
in
the
wrong
van
and
has
gone
on
to
whitecastle
i
was
obliged
to
telegraph
about
it
but
i
hope
we
may
get
it
this
evening
come
along
that
our
train
over
there
we
only
just
nice
time
for
it
will
start
in
a
few
minutes
now
give
me
the
wraps
she
took
the
from
the
child
hand
and
the
two
hurried
across
the
bridge
on
to
the
opposite
platform
here
our
porter
cried
mrs
have
you
put
all
in
the
van
yes
these
things
in
the
carriage
please
third
class
it
seems
almost
impossible
to
find
a
seat

there
room
here
how
fortunate
come
isobel

in
quickly

o
room
here
marm
shouted
a
stout
old
man
as
he
reached
out
a
strong
hand
to
help
her
into
the
carriage
and
found
a
place
for
her
wraps
upon
the
already
crowded
rack
the
compartment
was
more
than
half
full
a
party
of
cheap
trippers
with
a
wailing
baby
and
a
pierrot
with
a
banjo
which
he
occupied
himself
with
tuning
incessantly
did
not
offer
much
prospect
of
a
peaceful
journey
but
stewart
knew
it
was
impossible
to
choose
one
company
at
a
holiday
season
and
wisely
made
the
best
of
things
while
travelling
was
still
such
a
novelty
to
isobel
that
she
would
have
enjoyed
any
experience
it
no
easy
job
catchin
trains
marm
said
the
old
farmer
with
the

settled
herself
in
the
corner
with
much
content
she
had
never
expected
such
luck
as
to
secure
a
and
she
surveyed
the
ruddy

and
bushy
eyebrows

a
broad

tickets
ready
cried
the
inspector
breaking
in
upon
the
conversation
take
your
seats
please
all
stations
to
groby
heatherton
silversands
and
ferndale
there
was
a
last
stampede
for
places
among
excited
passengers
a
last
rush
of
porters
with
rugs
and
hat
boxes
the
guard
had
already
unfurled
his
green
flag
and
was
in
the
act
of
putting
the
whistle
to
his
lips
when
two
appeared
racing
in
frantic
haste
down
the
platform
o
mother
cried
isobel
that
lady
and
the
little
girl
are
going
to
be
left
behind
it
the
little
girl
in
the
blue
hat
too
they
were
buying
papers
at
the
bookstall
just
look
how
they
running
oh
the
stopping
the
train
for
them
i
think
they
catch
it
after
all
why
they
coming
in
here
put
us
in
anywhere
anywhere
cried
the
lady
in
desperate
tones
as
the
inspector
flung
open
the
carriage
door
here
you
are
m
cried
the
porter
seizing
the
little
girl
with
scant
ceremony
and
jumping
her
into
the
luggage
in
the
front
van
and
the
light
hampers
in
no
thank
you
stand
back
there
he
pocketed
his
tip
banged
the
door
violently
nearly
catching
fingers
thereby
the
whistle
sounded
and
the
train
started
off
with
a
jerk
that
almost
threw
the
newcomers
on
to
the
lap
of
old
binks
who
had
watched
their
sudden
arrival
with
interest
the
lady
apologized
prettily
and
finding
room
between
the
pierrot
and
a
with
several
large
baskets
she
sank
down
on
the
seat
with
a
sigh
of
relief
and
taking
a
and
a
large
black
fan
from
her
leaned
back
with
an
air
of
utter
exhaustion
mother
mother
cried
the
little
girl
do
you
see
they
put
us
into
a
carriage
never
mind
dear
replied
the
lady
i
was
only
too
thankful
to
catch
the
train
at
all
we
can
change
at
the
next
station
if
we
wish
but
it
seems
scarcely
worth
while
for
so
short
a
journey
the
carriages
are
so
crowded
that
the
firsts
are
as
bad
as
the
thirds
that
porter
dirty
hands
have
made
black
marks
on
my
dress
said
the
little
girl
disconsolately
why
could
the
train
wait
for
us
they
need
have
been
in
such
a
hurry
when
they
saw
we
were
coming
trains
do
wait
for
any
one
dear
it
was
your
own
fault
for
you
would
come
away
from
the
bookstall
i
told
you
to
be
quick
about
choosing
i
did
see
anything
i
wanted
books
are
all
just
the
same
i
think
i
shall
like
this
one
now
i
have
it
give
me
micky
please
taking
the
pet
dog
on
to
her
knee
shall
we
have
to
stay
very
long
in
this
carriage
i
so
terribly
hot
get
the
scent
out
of
my
bag
dearest
and
the
vinaigrette
you
soon
feel
better
now
this
nice
breeze
is
coming
in
through
the
window
if
the
train
fairly
punctual
we
shall
be
there
in
half
an
hour
it
past
three
already
consulting
a
pretty
enamelled
watch
which
was
pinned
on
to
her
dress
oh
dear
i
so
tired
i
hate
travelling
why
ca
we
have
a
carriage
to
ourselves
this
knocking
my
hat
off
let
us
change
at
the
next
station
how
the
baby
cries
it
making
my
head
ache
young
lady
do
fancy
her
company
said
the
moving
her
basket
as
she
spoke
i
paid
for
my
ticket
same
as
other
folks
and
my
money
as
good
as
any
one
else
so
far
as
i
can
see
some
people
had
better
order
a
train
to
themselves
if
they
too
fine
to
travel
with
the
likes
of
us
observed
one
of
the
trippers
with
sarcasm
i
sure
i
sorry
as
he
cries
so
apologized
the
weary
mother
of
the
wailing
baby
the
heat
turned
the
milk
sour
and
i
durst
give
him
his
bottle
he
wo
go
to
sleep
without
it
neither
so
i
ca
do
nothing
with
him
husht
husht
lovey
wilt
bairns
will
be
bairns
remarked
old
binks
sententiously
i
ought
to
know
for
i
reared
seven
live
and
let
live
my
motto
and
a
good
un
to
get
along
the
world
with
i
wager
as
young
missy
there
meant
no
offence
indeed
she
did
not
wish
to
hurt
anybody
feelings
said
the
lady
hastily
adding
in
a
low
tone
to
the
little
girl
be
quiet
dear
take
off
your
hat
and
perhaps
you
be
cooler
wedged
between
fat
old
binks
and
the
window
isobel
had
sat
watching
the
whole
scene
she
was
terribly
hot
but
the
crowded
carriage
and
its
miscellaneous
occupants
only
amused
her
and
she
divided
her
attention
between
the
quickly
passing
landscape
and
her
various
travelling
companions
stealing
frequent
glances
at
the
pretty
stranger
opposite
who
had
closed
her
eyes
in
languid
resignation
having
drawn
her
white
silk
skirts
as
far
as
possible
away
from
the
and
placed
her
hat
in
safety
upon
her
mother
knee
the
baby
was
asleep
at
last
worn
out
with
crying
and
the
trippers
were
handing
round
refreshments
large
wedges
of
pork
pie
sticky
buns
and
cold
tea
which
they
drank
in
turns
out
of
a
bottle
they
pressed
these
dainties
cordially
upon
everybody
in
the
carriage
but
the
only
one
who
consented
to
share
their
hospitality
was
the
who
remarked
audibly
that
was
not
proud
however
much
some
folks
might
stick
theirselves
up
in
return
she
produced
a
couple
of
apples
from
her
basket
which
she
presented
to
the
two
little
tripper
boys
who
promptly
quarrelled
which
should
have
the
bigger
and
kicked
each
other
lustily
on
the
shins
till
their
father
boxed
their
ears
and
threatened
to
send
them
home
by
the
next
returning
train
the
pierrot
created
a
diversion
at
this
point
by
playing
a
few
selections
upon
the
banjo
and
singing
a
comic
song
handing
round
his
tall
white
hat
afterwards
for
pennies
and
informing
the
company
that
they
could
have
the
pleasure
of
hearing
him
again
any
day
upon
the
pier
at
ferndale
at
and
prompt
i
glad
we
not
staying
at
ferndale
thought
isobel
if
all
these
people
are
going
there
i
sure
silversands
will
be
ever
so
much
nicer
and
she
turned
with
relief
to
look
out
through
the
open
window
after
running
for
a
long
distance
between
high
embankments
the
train
had
at
last
reached
the
coast
and
isobel
watched
with
rapture
the
sparkling
blue
sea
the
long
line
of
yellow
cliffs
and
the
red
sails
of
the
which
could
be
seen
on
the
distant
horizon
on
the
shore
she
could
catch
glimpses
of
delightful
little
pools
among
the
rocks
left
by
the
retreating
tide
and
binks
who
seemed
to
enjoy
acting
as
guide
drew
her
notice
continually
to
rows
of
children
riding
donkeys
or
digging
on
the
beach
or
fishwives
gathering
cockles
at
the
water
edge
pointing
out
the
various
objects
of
interest
with
a
fat
brown
finger
the
few
stations
which
they
passed
were
crowded
with
tourists
one
or
two
of
whom
opened
the
door
of
the
compartment
in
the
hope
of
finding
room
but
slammed
it
again
quickly
when
they
saw
the
number
of
its
occupants
they
did
ought
to
put
on
more
carriages
so
nigh
to
august
bank
holiday
said
binks
we
close
on
silversands
now
you
can
see
it
there
over
at
side
of
the
bay
so
you
wo
be
long
of
your
tea
you
be
rare
and
glad
to
get
some
i
take
it
if
you
feel
like
me
isobel
thought
it
was
the
longest
and
hottest
journey
she
ever
remembered
but
like
most
things
it
at
length
came
to
a
close
and
after
several
halts
and
tiresome
waitings
on
the
line
the
heavy
train
crawled
into
silversands
it
was
a
little
wayside
station
with
a
gay
garden
running
alongside
the
platform
and
the
name
silversands
elaborately
done
out
in
white
stones
upon
a
green
bank
a
group
of
scotch
firs
gave
a
pleasant
shade
and
a
suggestion
of
country
woods
the
sea
and
the
sands
were
just
visible
over
a
tall
hedge
of
flowering
tamarisk
the
meadows
were
full
of
buttercups
while
cornfields
beginning
already
to
yellow
with
ripening
crops
and
gay
with
scarlet
poppies
made
a
refreshing
sight
to
dusty
travellers
here
we
are
mother
cried
isobel
with
delight
this
is
really
silversands
at
last
oh
look
at
the
poppies
among
the
corn
are
they
lovely
ay
it
silversands
sure
enough
said
binks
opening
the
carriage
door
and
descending
with
the
caution
his
bulk
demanded
main
glad
i
am
to
see
it
again
too
take
care
honey
let
me
help
you
down
and
your
ma
too
you
welcome
marm
i
sure
to
anything
as
i
may
have
done
for
you
and
if
you
and
missy
here
is
takin
a
walk
some
day
towards
balk
just
ask
for
binks
of
the
white
coppice
and
my
missus
make
you
a
cup
of
tea
any
time
as
you
likes
to
call
to
you
and
he
moved
away
down
the
platform
with
the
satisfied
air
of
one
who
again
finds
his
foot
on
his
native
heath
silversands
seemed
also
to
be
the
destination
of
the
two
travellers
in
whom
isobel
had
taken
such
an
interest
as
they
got
out
of
the
train
with
much
apparent
relief
and
were
greeted
by
quite
a
number
of
enthusiastic
and
friends
who
had
come
to
the
station
to
meet
them
we
had
the
most
journey
isobel
overheard
the
little
girl
saying
we
were
obliged
to
go
in
a
carriage
with
the
rudest
and
dirtiest
people
i
sure
i
black
all
over
oh
i
glad
to
have
got
here
at
last
she
retailed
her
experiences
to
a
sympathetic
audience
while
her
mother
who
it
appeared
had
lost
a
handbag
insisted
upon
calling
the
and
giving
a
full
description
of
both
its
labels
and
contents
and
until
their
numerous
boxes
and
portmanteaus
had
been
collected
and
disposed
on
a
carriage
and
they
and
their
friends
had
finally
passed
through
the
gate
at
the
bottom
of
the
platform
it
was
quite
impossible
for
stewart
to
secure
the
services
of
the
solitary
porter
she
managed
at
last
however
to
gather
together
her
modest
luggage
and
leaving
it
to
follow
upon
a
set
out
with
isobel
to
walk
to
the
lodgings
which
she
had
engaged
chapter
ii
stewart
letter
is
half
against
my
judgment
kindly
fortune
send
fair
prosperity
upon
this
venture
it
will
be
quite
easy
to
find
our
rooms
mother
said
isobel
we
know
they
close
to
the
beach
and
there
only
seems
to
be
one
row
of
down
on
the
shore
i
suppose
that
must
be
marine
terrace
for
there
is
any
other
what
jolly
sands
ca
you
taste
the
salt
on
your
lips
i
feel
as
if
i
shall
just
want
to
be
by
the
sea
all
the
time
i
hope
it
will
do
you
good
dear
said
her
mother
i
declare
you
look
better
already
i
shall
expect
you
to
grow
quite
rosy
before
we
go
home
again
and
to
have
ever
such
a
big
appetite
i
hungry
now
replied
isobel
i
hope
jackson
will
bring
in
tea
directly
we
arrive
i
mean
to
ask
her
first
thing
if
she
knows
binks
was
it
nice
of
him
to
let
me
sit
by
the
window
do
you
think
we
shall
be
taking
a
walk
to
the
i
do
know
in
the
least
what
a
is
but
i
suppose
we
shall
find
out
i
should
like
immensely
to
go
to
his
farm
i
dare
say
we
might
call
there
some
afternoon
he
seemed
a
kind
old
man
and
i
believe
he
really
meant
what
he
said
and
would
be
pleased
to
see
you
were
the
people
in
the
carriage
funny
mother
how
tiresome
that
pierrot
was
with
his
banjo
and
the
poor
baby
that
would
stop
crying
i
was
so
glad
the
little
girl
in
the
blue
hat
did
miss
the
train
is
she
lovely
she
rather
pretty
said
stewart
but
i
could
see
her
very
well
she
was
sitting
on
my
side
you
remember
i
think
she
perfectly
beautiful
declared
isobel
with
enthusiasm
just
like
one
of
those
expensive
french
dolls
at
the
stores
did
you
see
them
drive
away
in
the
landau
i
wonder
where
they
staying
and
if
we
shall
ever
meet
them
again
perhaps
you
may
see
her
walking
on
the
beach
or
in
church
suggested
stewart
i
hope
i
shall
i
wonder
what
her
name
is
do
you
think
she
mind
if
i
were
to
ask
her
perhaps
her
mother
might
not
like
it
replied
stewart
afraid
it
would
hardly
be
polite
but
i
do
so
want
to
get
to
know
her
i
have
any
friends
here
you
see
and
i
think
she
looks
so
nice
i
sorry
dear
but
i
should
care
for
you
to
try
to
scrape
an
acquaintance
with
these
people
we
shall
manage
to
have
a
very
happy
time
together
hunting
for
shells
and
you
must
take
me
for
a
friend
instead
you
better
than
any
friend
said
isobel
squeezing
her
hand
of
course
i
like
being
with
you
best
sweetest
only
sometimes
when
you
reading
or
lying
down
it
nice
to
have
somebody
to
talk
to
i
wo
ask
her
her
name
if
you
say
i
better
not
but
i
hope
i
shall
see
her
again
if
it
only
just
to
look
at
her
why
this
is
the
house
there
no
over
the
doorway
and
that
must
be
jackson
standing
in
the
front
garden
looking
out
for
us
i
think
she
ought
to
be
binks
cousin
she
as
fat
and
red
in
the
face
as
he
is
the
place
is
very
full
mum
said
jackson
showing
them
to
the
little
back
which
at
august
prices
was
all
stewart
had
been
able
to
afford
i
had
three
parties
in
yesterday
askin
for
rooms
and
could
have
let
this
small
parlour
twice
over
for
double
the
money
but
what
i
promised
it
to
you
not
as
i
wanted
to
take
though
for
they
was
all
noisy
lots
as
would
have
needed
a
deal
of
waitin
on
i
rather
have
quiet
visitors
like
you
and
the
young
lady
here
as
is
always
their
bells
and
playin
on
the
pianer
till
midnight
though
i
may
be
the
loser
by
it
i
now
my
daughter
emma
jane
married
and
not
so
quick
at
gettin
up
and
down
stairs
as
i
used
to
be
i
do
think
you
find
we
shall
give
more
trouble
than
we
can
help
said
stewart
gently
we
seldom
require
much
waiting
on
and
we
hope
to
be
out
most
of
the
day
i
only
too
glad
to
do
all
i
can
mum
to
make
folks
feel
declared
jackson
showing
the
capacities
of
the
cupboard
and
calling
attention
to
the
superior
comfort
of
the
armchairs
and
if
there
anything
else
you
like
i
hope
as
you
mention
it
i
a
little
short
in
my
breath
and
a
bit
lame
in
my
right
leg
troubled
with
rheumatics
in
the
winter
but
i
do
my
best
to
please
and
so
does
polly
she
my
niece
though
she
a
girl
with
no
head
and
ca
remember
a
thing
for
two
minutes
on
end
i
sure
you
make
us
comfortable
said
stewart
and
we
hope
to
have
a
very
happy
time
indeed
at
silversands
we
should
be
glad
if
you
could
bring
in
tea
now
we
both
very
hot
and
thirsty
after
our
long
journey
that
you
will
be
i
sure
mum
returned
jackson
we
not
had
a
hotter
day
this
summer
little
missy
looks
fair
tired
out
but
nought
like
a
cup
of
tea
to
refresh
one
and
i
have
it
up
in
a
few
minutes
the
kettle
ready
and
boilin
the
room
feels
rather
stuffy
said
stewart
throwing
open
the
window
when
her
landlady
had
departed
to
the
kitchen
regions
i
sorry
we
have
no
view
of
the
sea
but
we
ca
help
that
and
we
must
be
out
of
doors
the
whole
day
long
luckily
the
weather
is
gloriously
fine
and
seems
likely
to
keep
so
what
queer
ornaments
mother
said
isobel
going
slowly
round
the
room
and
examining
with
much
curiosity
two
stuffed
cocks
a
glass
bottle
containing
a
model
of
a
ship
with
full
sail
and
rigging
a
case
of
somewhat
and
dilapidated
butterflies
a
representation
of
windsor
castle
cut
out
in
cork
some
sickly
portraits
of
the
royal
family
in
cheap
german
gilt
frames
and
a
large
berlin
sampler
which
in
addition
to
the
alphabet
and
a
verse
of
a
hymn
depicted
birds
of
paradise
at
the
top
and
weeping
willows
at
the
bottom
and
set
forth
that
it
was
the
work
of
eliza
jane
horrocks
aged
ten
years
i
think
we
sha
need
quite
so
many
crochet
antimacassars
laughed
stewart
there
seems
to
be
one
on
every
chair
and
there
are
actually
five
on
the
sofa
we
must
ask
jackson
to
take
some
of
them
away
we
would
rather
be
without
all
these
shell
baskets
and
photo
frames
on
the
little
table
too
if
we
moved
it
into
the
window
it
would
be
very
nice
for
painting
or
writing
if
it
should
happen
to
be
a
wet
day
i
hope
it
wo
be
wet
said
isobel
at
any
rate
there
are
some
books
to
read
if
it
is
turning
over
a
row
of
volumes
which
reposed
on
the
top
of
the
chiffonnier
i
never
seen
such
peculiar
pictures
the
little
girls
have
white
trousers
right
down
to
their
ankles
and
the
boys
have
deep
frilled
collars
and
quite
long
hair
they
are
very
books
said
stewart
examining
with
a
smile
the
youth
moral
miscellany
the
maiden
garland
a
for
the
mind
and
instructive
stories
for
young
people
which
with
a
edition
of
sandford
and
merton
a
battered
copy
of
the
history
of
the
fairchild
family
and
a
few
bound
volumes
of
made
up
the
extent
of
the
library
i
should
think
they
must
have
belonged
to
jackson
mother
or
grandmother
for
this
one
has
the
date
written
inside
it
of
course
they
do
look
so
nice
as
my
books
at
home
said
isobel
but
they
be
something
new
you
such
a
greedy
reader
that
no
doubt
you
will
get
through
them
however
dry
they
may
prove
laughed
her
mother
here
comes
our
tea
we
shall
enjoy
eggs
and
fresh
country
butter
sha
we
i
wonder
if
they
from
binks
farm
said
isobel
seating
herself
at
the
do
you
know
binks
jackson
he
said
i
was
to
ask
you
and
he
was
sure
you
would
deny
the
acquaintance
know
peter
binks
miss
exclaimed
jackson
why
there
is
a
soul
in
silversands
as
does
know
him
binks
has
lived
at
the
white
coppice
ever
since
i
was
a
girl
and
afore
then
and
him
too
and
owner
of
the
as
good
a
schooner
as
any
about
his
wife
second
cousin
is
married
to
my
daughter
and
livin
at
ferndale
know
him
i
should
just
say
i
do
i
thought
you
would
said
isobel
delightedly
we
met
him
in
the
train
as
we
were
coming
he
gave
me
his
seat
by
the
window
and
asked
us
to
go
to
his
farm
some
day
you
be
able
to
tell
us
the
way
wo
you
another
time
dear
child
said
stewart
jackson
busy
now
and
our
tea
is
thank
you
yes
i
think
we
have
everything
we
need
at
present
polly
might
bring
a
little
boiling
water
in
a
few
minutes
and
we
will
ring
the
bell
if
we
require
anything
come
isobel
you
said
you
were
hungry
a
lady
said
jackson
afterwards
to
her
husband
in
the
privacy
of
the
kitchen
any
one
could
see
with
half
an
eye
as
they
was
gentlefolk
though
they
only
taken
the
back
room
i
wonder
now
if
they
can
be
any
relation
to
old
stewart
at
the
chase
they
did
say
as
the
son
him
as
was
killed
in
the
war
had
married
somewhere
in
furrin
parts
and
his
father
was
terrible
set
against
it
havin
a
wife
of
his
own
choosin
ready
for
him
at
home
a
regular
family
quarrel
it
was
and
both
too
proud
to
make
it
up
but
they
said
the
old
man
was
nigh
heartbroken
when
his
son
was
taken
and
he
never
sent
him
a
kind
word
i
had
it
all
from
peter
binks
nephew
who
was
there
at
the
time
it
might
be
said
jackson
oracularly
taking
a
pinch
of
snuff
as
he
spoke
and
on
the
other
hand
it
might
not
be
stewart
by
no
means
an
uncommon
kind
of
a
name
there
was
a
stewart
second
mate
on
the
when
we
took
kippers
over
to
belfast
and
there
was
a
chap
called
stewart
as
used
to
keep
a
snug
little
public
down
by
the
quay
in
whitecastle
but
i
never
heard
tell
as
either
of
was
any
connection
of
old
stewart
up
at
the
chase
it
were
likely
they
should
be
replied
jackson
with
scorn
but
that
do
make
it
any
less
likely
in
this
case
i
remember
godfrey
quite
well
when
we
lived
at
linkhead
and
i
used
to
walk
over
with
emma
jane
to
heatherton
church
of
a
sunday
afternoon
a
fine
handsome
young
fellow
he
was
too
sittin
with
his
father
in
the
family
pew
takin
a
yawn
behind
his
hand
durin
the
sermon
and
small
blame
to
him
too
old
canon
martindale
used
to
preach
that
long
i
can
see
him
now
if
i
close
my
eyes
with
his
light
hair
shinin
against
the
red
curtain
of
the
big
square
pew
little
missy
has
quite
a
look
of
him
to
my
mind
you
always
imaginin
romances
eliza
said
jackson
it
comes
of
too
much
readin
you
and
polly
sit
over
them
stories
in
family
till
you
make
up
goodness
knows
what
tales
about
every
new
party
as
comes
to
the
house
there
was
the
young
man
with
the
long
hair
as
played
the
fiddle
whom
you
was
sure
was
a
furrin
count
and
who
only
turned
out
to
be
one
of
the
band
at
ferndale
and
went
off
without
payin
his
bill
and
there
was
a
couple
in
the
as
talked
that
grand
about
their
motor
car
and
their
shootin
box
and
important
business
till
you
thought
it
was
a
member
of
parliament
and
his
lady
takin
a
rest
and
travellin
till
you
found
out
they
was
only
wine
merchants
from
whitecastle
after
all
do
you
go
let
them
manage
their
own
affairs
and
we
manage
ours
how
you
talk
declared
jackson
indignantly
who
wants
to
meddle
as
if
one
could
take
a
bit
of
interest
in
one
own
visitors
there
the
and
the
will
be
its
tea
stir
the
fire
joe
and
hold
the
toast
whilst
i
answer
the
bell
where

polly
to
i
wonder
in
spite
of
her
husband
disdainful
comments
jackson
surmises
were
not
altogether
groundless
and
if
she
had
peeped
into
her
back
that
evening
when
isobel
was
in
bed
she
might
have
seen
her
visitor
slowly
and
with
much
care
and
thought
composing
a
letter
sheet
after
sheet
of
notepaper
was
covered
and
then
torn
up
for
the
writer
efforts
did
not
seem
to
satisfy
her
and
she
leaned
her
head
on
her
hand
every
now
and
then
with
a
weary
air
as
if
she
had
undertaken
a
distasteful
task
i
do
not
ask
anything
for
myself
wrote
stewart
at
last
that
you
should
care
to
meet
me
or
ever
become
reconciled
to
me
is
i
know
beyond
all
question
my
one
request
is
that
you
will
see
your
grandchild
she
is
now
nearly
eleven
years
of
age
a
thorough
stewart
tall
and
fair
and
with
so
strong
a
resemblance
to
her
father
that
you
can
not
fail
to
see
the
likeness
i
have
done
my
utmost
for
her
but
i
am
not
able
to
give
her
the
advantages
i
should
wish
her
to
have
and
which
as
her
father
child
i
feel
it
is
hard
for
her
to
lack
she
is
named
isobel
after
your
only
daughter
the
little
sister
whose
loss
my
husband
always
spoke
of
with
so
much
regret
and
whom
he
hoped
she
might
resemble
you
would
find
her
truthful
straightforward
obedient
and
and
in
every
respect
worthy
of
the
name
of
stewart
it
is
with
the
greatest
difficulty
that
i
bring
myself
to
ask
of
you
any
favour
but
for
the
sake
of
the
one
dear
to
us
both
who
is
gone
i
beg
that
you
will
at
least
see
my
isobel
and
judge
her
for
yourself
she
addressed
the
letter
to
colonel
stewart
the
chase
sealed
it
stamped
it
and
took
it
herself
to
the
post
for
a
moment
she
stood
and
hesitated
a
moment
in
which
she
seemed
almost
inclined
to
draw
back
after
all
she
turned
the
letter
over
doubtfully
in
her
hand
went
a
step
away
then
suddenly
straightening
herself
with
an
air
of
firm
determination
she
dropped
it
into
the
and
returned
to
her
lodgings
going
upstairs
to
the
bedroom
she
tenderly
lifted
the
soft
golden
hair
and
looked
at
the
quiet
sleeping
face
of
her
little
girl
he
can
not
fail
to
like
her
she
said
to
herself
it
was
the
only
right
thing
to
do
and
what
would
have
wished
i
glad
i
have
had
the
courage
to
make
the
attempt
he
will
surely
acknowledge
her
now
and
my
one
prayer
is
that
he
will
not
take
her
away
from
me
chapter
iii
a
meeting
on
the
sands
what
in
a
name
that
which
we
call
a
rose
by
any
other
name
would
smell
as
sweet
the
little
town
of
silversands
was
built
on
the
cliffs
by
the
sea
so
close
over
the
water
that
the
dash
of
the
waves
was
always
in
your
ears
and
the
taste
of
the
salt
spray
on
your
lips
the
picturesque
thatched
fishermen
cottages
lay
scattered
one
above
another
down
the
steep
hillside
at
such
strange
and
irregular
angles
that
the
narrow
streets
which
led
from
the
quay
wound
in
and
out
like
a
maze
and
you
found
your
way
to
the
shore
down
flights
of
wide
steps
under
low
archways
or
by
a
pathway
cut
through
your
neighbour
cabbage
patch
it
was
not
difficult
to
guess
the
occupation
of
most
of
the
inhabitants
for
of
all
descriptions
might
be
seen
hanging
out
to
dry
over
every
available
railing
great
flat
skates
and
conger
eels
were
nailed
to
the
doorways
to
be
cured
in
the
sun
women
appeared
to
be
eternally
washing
blue
jerseys
which
fluttered
like
flags
from
the
various
little
gardens
and
the
children
who
gathered
cockles
on
the
sands
or
angled
for
crabs
from
the
jetty
seemed
as
much
at
home
in
the
water
as
on
dry
land
the
harbour
was
decidedly
fishy
bronzed
burly
seamen
were
perpetually
unloading
cargoes
of
herrings
which
they
stowed
away
into
barrels
or
lobsters
that
were
carefully
packed
in
baskets
to
be
dispatched
to
the
neighbouring
towns
there
was
a
kind
of
market
fitted
up
with
rickety
stalls
where
you
might
buy
fresh
cod
and
mackerel
still
alive
and
shining
with
all
the
lovely
fleeting
colours
which
fade
so
quickly
when
they
are
taken
from
the
water
you
could
afford
to
be
extravagant
in
the
way
of
if
you
liked
such
delicacies
since
a
large
red
cotton
full
of
cockles
and
mussels
only
cost
a
penny
and
whelks
and
periwinkles
sold
at
a
halfpenny
the
pint
at
high
water
the
quay
was
always
agog
with
excitement
the
coming
in
of
the
boats
being
accompanied
with
that
hauling
of
ropes
creaking
of
windlasses
shouting
of
hoarse
voices
and
general
confusion
both
among
toiling
workers
and
idle
loungers
that
seem
inseparable
from
the
business
of
a
port
while
the
occasional
advent
of
an
excursion
steamer
was
an
event
which
attracted
every
in
the
harbour
all
the
talk
at
silversands
was
of
tides
and
storms
of
good
or
bad
catches
the
luck
of
one
vessel
or
the
of
another
and
to
the
the
affairs
of
the
empire
were
of
small
importance
compared
with
the
arrival
and
departure
of
the
the
schools
gave
a
thin
veneer
of
education
but
it
seemed
to
vanish
away
directly
with
the
contact
of
the
waves
so
that
the
customs
and
modes
of
thought
of
most
of
the
people
differed
little
from
those
of
their
forefathers
who
slept
some
in
the
churchyard
on
the
edge
of
the
cliff
with
quaint
epitaphs
to
record
their
virtues
and
some
in
those
deeper
graves
over
which
no
stones
could
be
reared
standing
apart
from
the
old
town
was
a
modern
portion
which
was
just
beginning
to
dignify
itself
with
the
name
of
a
seaside
resort
to
be
sure
it
was
yet
guiltless
of
pier
promenade
band
or
niggers
but
as
the
owner
of
the
new
grocery
stores
remarked
you
never
knew
what
might
follow
and
many
a
fashionable
had
risen
from
quite
as
modest
a
commencement
there
was
already
a
row
of
shops
with
windows
and
a
handsome
display
of
spades
buckets
baskets
china
ornaments
photographic
views
and
other
articles
calculated
to
tempt
the
shillings
from
the
pockets
of
summer
visitors
there
were
several
streets
of
near
the
railway
station
as
well
as
the
long
terrace
facing
the
sea
dignified
rather
prematurely
by
the
name
of
the
parade
and
an
enterprising
tradesman
from
ferndale
had
opened
a
and
a
circulating
library
the
proprietor
of
the
bathing
machines
was
doing
a
good
business
and
had
set
up
a
stand
with
six
donkeys
a
photographer
had
ventured
to
erect
a
wooden
studio
upon
the
beach
where
he
would
take
your
likeness
for
eighteenpence
and
the
common
was
occasionally
the
camp
of
some
travelling
circus
which
though
for
a
larger
sphere
of
action
did
not
disdain
to
give
a
performance
in
passing
like
a
link
between
the
old
and
the
new
the
ancient
gray
stone
church
stood
on
the
verge
of
the
cliff
above
the
harbour
looking
out
to
sea
as
if
it
were
always
watching
over
those
of
its
children
who
had
their
business
in
great
waters
and
sending
up
silent
prayers
on
their
behalf
in
the
square
tower
the
bells
had
rung
for
seven
hundred
years
and
the
flat
roof
with
its
turreted
battlements
told
tales
of
wild
times
of
border
forays
when
the
people
had
fled
with
their
goods
to
the
one
spot
of
safety
and
watched
the
smoke
of
their
burning
farms
as
the
victorious
scots
drove
away
their
cattle
over
the
blue
line
of
hills
towards
the
north
but
i
think
the
great
attraction
of
silversands
was
its
delightful
beach
the
sands
were
hard
and
firm
and
covered
in
places
with
patches
of
sea
holly
or
horned
poppies
and
the
beautiful
pink
bindweed
growing
here
and
there
with
its
roots
deep
down
among
the
clumps
of
stones
above
rose
the
cliffs
in
bold
craggy
outlines
their
tops
crowned
by
a
common
which
stretched
far
inland
while
the
low
tide
disclosed
attractive
rocky
pools
where
anemones
hermit
crabs
sea
urchins
jelly
fish
mermaids
purses
starfishes
and
all
kinds
of
fascinating
objects
might
be
captured
by
those
who
cared
to
look
for
them
the
afternoon
of
the
day
following
her
arrival
found
isobel
wandering
along
this
shore
alone
stewart
had
been
unfortunate
enough
to
meet
with
an
accident
that
morning
slipping
on
the
rocks
she
had
twisted
her
ankle
severely
and
it
was
only
with
the
greatest
difficulty
that
she
had
managed
to
limp
back
to
the
lodgings
it
a
bad
sprain
too
said
jackson
shaking
her
head
as
she
helped
to
soak
cold
water
bandages
you
wo
be
able
to
put
that
foot
to
the
ground
for
a
matter
of
ten
days
or
more
it
a
good
thing
now
as
i
did
sell
the
sofa
which
i
nearly
let
it
go
in
the
spring
as
it
do
fill
up
the
room
so
but
you
can
rest
there
nicely
and
keep
puttin
on
fresh
cloths
all
the
time
though
it
do
seem
a
pity
with
your
holiday
only
just
begun
i
must
try
to
be
patient
and
get
it
well
as
fast
as
possible
replied
mrs
i
afraid
it
will
be
very
dull
for
you
isobel
my
poor
child
while
i
lying
here
you
will
have
to
amuse
yourself
on
the
beach
as
best
you
can
i
certainly
ca
have
you
staying
indoors
on
my
account
it
will
be
much
duller
for
you
mother
dear
said
isobel
i
shall
be
all
right
i
like
being
on
the
shore
but
you
wo
have
anything
to
do
except
read
what
a
good
thing
we
brought
plenty
of
books
with
us
so
sorry
our
has
any
view
i
shall
try
to
find
all
the
shells
and
and
things
that
i
can
and
keep
bringing
them
in
to
show
you
it
was
on
a
quest
therefore
for
any
treasures
which
she
thought
might
interest
her
mother
that
isobel
strolled
slowly
along
looking
with
delight
at
the
gleaming
sea
the
red
sails
of
the
and
the
little
white
yacht
which
came
slowly
round
the
point
of
the
cliff
waiting
for
a
puff
of
wind
to
take
her
to
the
harbour
the
tide
was
coming
in
fast
and
the
churning
of
the
waves
as
they
ground
the
small
pebbles
along
the
beach
had
the
most
inspiriting
and
refreshing
sound
she
stooped
every
now
and
then
to
pick
up
a
shell
or
to
clutch
at
a
great
piece
of
ribbon
which
was
dashed
to
her
feet
by
an
advancing
wave
she
had
an
exciting
chase
after
a
scuttling
crab
and
missed
him
in
the
end
and
nearly
got
drenched
with
spray
trying
to
rescue
a
which
she
could
see
floating
at
the
edge
of
the
water
she
had
filled
her
pockets
with
a
moist
collection
of
specimens
and
was
half
thinking
of
turning
back
to
retrace
her
footsteps
to
marine
terrace
when
from
behind
a
crag
of
rock
which
jutted
out
sharply
on
to
the
sands
she
heard
a
sound
of
children
voices
and
laughter
moved
with
curiosity
she
peeped
round
the
corner
and
found
herself
at
the
edge
of
a
small
patch
of
green
common
that
ran
along
the
shore
between
the
cliffs
and
the
sea
it
was
covered
with
soft
fine
grass
and
little
flowers
the
broken
masts
washed
up
from
a
wreck
made
capital
seats
and
altogether
it
appeared
as
pleasant
a
playground
as
could
well
be
imagined
so
at
any
rate
seemed
to
think
the
group
of
boys
and
girls
who
were
assembled
there
since
they
had
set
up
some
wickets
and
were
enthusiastically
engaged
in
a
game
of
cricket
for
which
the
short
fine
grass
made
an
excellent
pitch
it
looked
so
interesting
that
isobel
strolled
rather
nearer
to
the
players
and
finding
an
upturned
boat
upon
the
beach
she
curled
herself
under
its
shadow
and
settled
down
apparently
unnoticed
to
watch
the
progress
of
the
game
she
could
hear
as
well
as
see
and
her
ears
were
keenly
alert
to
the
scraps
of
lively
conversation
which
floated
towards
her
have
you
found
the
ball
yes
under
a
heap
of
nettles
and
stung
my
fingers
horribly
just
look
at
the
blisters

bertie

out

screw

a
shame
i
always
seem
to
get
left
out
of
things
grumbled
the
little
girl
with
a
very
aggrieved
countenance
sitting
down
upon
a
rusty
anchor
and
nursing
her
nettled
hand
tenderly
it
your
own
fault
this
time
at
any
rate
said
a
companion
with
scant
sympathy
there
are
plenty
of
dock
leaves
growing
under
the
cliff
if
you
want
them
bravo
bertie
well
hit
quick
with
that
ball
arthur

of
his
nasty
screws
or
sneaks

be
friends

him
any
more
isobel
gazed
at
the
last
speaker
entranced
there
was
no
mistaking
the
cheeks
and
the
silky
flaxen
curls
of
her
in
the
crowded
carriage
though
the
white
silk
dress
and
the
blue
hat
were
replaced
by
a
delicate
pale
pink
muslin
and
a
straw
trimmed
with
a
gauze
scarf
she
looked
even
more
charming
than
ever
like
some
fairy
in
a
or
one
of
the
very
prettiest
pictures
you
get
upon
chocolate
boxes
she
seemed
to
put
all
other
children
round
her
in
the
shade
and
as
she
stood
there
a
graceful
little
figure
at
the
wicket
isobel
eyes
followed
her
every
movement
with
an
absolute
fascination
the
first
ball
was
a
slow
one
and
she
hit
it
fairly
well
but
did
not
make
a
run
the
next
she
merely
slogged
the
third
was
high
and
as
she
wisely
let
it
alone
it
cleared
the
wicket
the
fourth
was
a
full
pitch
she
tried
to
play
it
down
but
unfortunately
it
hit
the
top
of
her
bat
and
went
right
into
the
hands
caught
she
out
what
an
easy
catch
come
along
aggie
your
innings
the
vanquished
player
put
down
her
bat
somewhat
reluctantly
and
walked
slowly
away
in
the
direction
of
the
old
boat
she
sat
down
on
the
sand
close
by
isobel
and
taking
off
her
hat
began
to
fan
her
hot
face
with
it
after
stealing
several
glances
at
her
companion
she
at
length
volunteered
a
remark
it
was
too
bad
was
it
she
said
to
be
caught
out
first
thing
like
that
much
too
bad
replied
isobel
but
i
think
they
were
horrid
balls
so
they
were
hugh
always
sends
the
most
mean
ones
were
you
in
the
train
with
us
yesterday

i
saw
you
first
at
the
bookstall
at
tiverton
did
you
think
the
people
in
the
carriage
detestable
i
nearly
died
with
the
heat
and
stuffiness
it
was
dreadfully
hot
and
noisy
noisy
i
do
know
which
was
worse
the
baby
or
the
banjo
you
were
better
off
sitting
by
the
window
though
that
fat
old
man
would
keep
talking
to
you
he
was
rather
kind
said
isobel
i
did
mind
him
i
suppose

staying
at
silversands

at
marine
terrace

little
place
like
this
but
they
do
know
how
to
wait

she
wishes

hotel

rather
but

a
great
deal
with
mother

when

home

much
and
then
i
never
know
what
to
do
do
you
read
said
isobel
i
not
fond
of
reading
i
only
like
books
when
there
really
nothing
else
to
amuse
myself
with
you
were
buying
a
book
at
tiverton
which
one
did
you
get
is
it
nice
it
just
a
school
story
i
forget
its
name
now
i
have
looked
at
it
again
then
you
did
choose
red
cross
knight
after
all
oh
that
too
like
lessons
i
had
all
that
with
my
governess
and
about
king
arthur
too
i
quite
tired
of
them
have
you
a
governess
no
replied
isobel
i
do
lessons
with
mother
how
jolly
for
you
i
wish
i
did
i
to
be
sent
to
school
in
another
year
and
i
do
think
i
shall
like
that
at
all
when
are
you
going
not
till
i
thirteen
i
expect
how
old
are
you
now
almost
eleven
why
so
am
i
when
your
birthday
on
the
thirteenth
of
september
and
mine
is
on
the
tenth
of
october
so
you
nearly
a
month
older
than
i
am
you
have
told
me
your
name
yet
my
name
isobel
stewart
what
cried
the
other
opening
her
blue
eyes
wide
in
the
greatest
astonishment
that
name
name
exclaimed
isobel
in
equal
amazement
of
course
it
is
name
isabelle
stuart
how
do
you
spell
it
and
mine
spelt
so
that
makes
a
little
difference
so
it
does
i
called
too
for
short
are
you
no
never
anything
but
isobel
it
funny
we
the
same
name
and
the
same
age
and
we
staying
in
the
same
terrace
i
think
it
is
what
you
call
a
we
came
to
silversands
on
the
same
day
too
and
in
the
same
railway
carriage
we
ought
to
be
twin
sisters
you
really
rather
like
me
you
know
only
you
pale
and
your
hair
does
curl
isobel
shook
her
head
she
had
a
very
modest
opinion
of
her
own
attractions
and
would
not
have
dreamt
of
comparing
her
appearance
with
that
of
her
pretty
companion
so
very
far
did
she
think
she
ranked
below
the
other
style
of
beauty
i
should
like
to
be
friends
at
any
rate
she
said
shyly
perhaps
i
shall
see
you
again
upon
the
shore
i
afraid
that
your
mother
calling
you
i
think
i
ought
to
go
home
now
too
i
did
mean
to
be
out
so
long
isabelle
stuart
sprang
to
her
feet
yes
it
mother
calling
she
said
she
walked
up
with
rokeby
i
must
fly
but
i
hope
we
shall
meet
again
i
shall
look
out
for
you
on
the
sands
isobel
stood
watching
her
as
she
ran
lightly
away
then
turning
she
hurried
home
as
fast
as
possible
along
the
beach
for
she
was
very
excited
at
this
strange
meeting
and
was
anxious
to
give
her
mother
a
full
and
detailed
account
of
it
i
did
ask
her
name
mother
she
explained
it
was
she
who
asked
me
mine
you
told
me
i
better
not
speak
to
her
but
she
spoke
to
me
first
and
asked
me
ever
so
many
questions
is
it
queer
that
our
names
should
be
just
the
same
and
our
ages
too
you
let
us
be
friends
now
wo
you
i
think
she
the
nicest
girl
i
ever
met
in
my
life
and
i
ca
tell
you
how
much
i
want
to
know
her
chapter
iv
the
sea
urchins
club
was
here
where
the
urchins
would
gather
to
play
in
the
shadows
of
twilight
or
sunny
midday
isobel
found
her
namesake
waiting
for
her
on
the
beach
next
morning
i
thought
you
be
coming
out
soon
announced
belle
so
i
just
stopped
about
till
i
saw
you
we
all
starting
off
to
play
cricket
again
on
the
common
down
under
the
cliffs
and
i
want
you
to
go
with
us
i
taken
a
fancy
to
you
i
told
mother
i
had
and
she
laughed
and
said
it
would
last
long
but
i
it
will
i
feel
as
if
you
were
going
to
be
my
bosom
friend
you
come
wo
you
of
course
i
will
replied
isobel
accepting
the
offered
friendship
with
rapture
mother
told
me
to
do
what
i
liked
this
morning
let
us
be
quick
then
the
others
have
run
on
in
front
but
we
soon
catch
them
up
are
you
going
to
the
same
place
where
you
were
playing
yesterday
asked
isobel
yes
we
call
it
our
club
ground
we
mean
to
have
matches
there
almost
every
day
it
be
ever
such
fun
you
see
there
are
several
families
of
us
staying
at
silversands
that
all
know
one
another
so
we
joined
ourselves
together
in
a
club
we
call
it
united
sea
recreation
society
and
it
not
to
be
only
for
cricket
because
we
mean
to
play
rounders
and
hockey
as
well
and
to
go
out
boating
and
have
shrimping
parties
on
the
sands
we
arranged
it
last
night
after
tea
there
are
just
twenty
of
us
if
you
count
the
wrights
baby
so
that
makes
quite
enough
to
get
up
all
sorts
of
games
hugh
rokeby
the
president
and
charlie
chester
secretary
and
charlotte
treasurer
we
each
pay
twopence
a
week
subscription
and
at
the
end
of
the
holiday
we
going
to
have
what
the
boys
call
a
with
the
funds
ginger
beer
you
know
and
cakes
and
ices
if
we
can
afford
it
i
wanted
to
make
the
subscription
sixpence
but
letty
rokeby
said
the
little
ones
could
give
so
much
i
ask
them
to
elect
you
a
member
you
like
to
join
would
you
immensely
but
i
have
any
money
with
me
now
oh
never
mind
you
can
give
it
to
charlotte
afterwards
here
we
are
i
expect
they
all
waiting
i
see
they
put
the
stumps
up
you
know
anybody
except
me
do
you
i
soon
tell
you
their
names
the
party
of
children
who
were
assembled
upon
the
green
patch
of
common
certainly
appeared
to
be
a
very
jolly
one
first
there
were
the
rokebys
a
large
and
tempestuous
family
of
seven
who
were
staying
at
a
farm
on
the
cliffs
by
the
wood
a
thoroughly
healthy
place
as
rokeby
often
remarked
with
a
good
water
supply
and
no
danger
of
catching
anything
infectious
really
been
so
unfortunate
hugh
and
letty
took
scarlet
fever
at
the
lodgings
in
llandudno
last
year
and
i
had
the
most
dreadful
time
nursing
them
winnie
and
arnold
had
mumps
at
scarborough
the
year
before
and
the
three
youngest
were
laid
up
with
german
measles
at
easter
in
the
isle
of
man
so
it
has
made
me
quite
nervous
just
at
present
the
rokebys
did
not
seem
in
danger
of
contracting
anything
more
serious
than
colds
or
sprained
ankles
for
a
more
reckless
crew
in
the
way
of
falling
into
wet
pools
climbing
slippery
rocks
or
generally
endangering
their
lives
and
limbs
could
not
be
imagined
it
was
in
vain
that
poor
rokeby
dried
their
boots
and
brushed
their
clothes
and
implored
them
to
keep
away
from
perilous
spots
they
were
full
of
repentance
and
would
vow
amendment
with
the
most
of
hugs
but
in
half
an
hour
they
had
forgotten
all
their
promises
and
would
be
racing
over
the
rocks
again
as
wet
and
jolly
as
ever
i
really
do
my
best
to
keep
them
tidy
sighed
rokeby
pathetically
to
barrington
their
father
grumbles
horribly
at
the
bills
but
they
seem
to
wear
their
clothes
out
as
fast
as
i
buy
them
bertie
new
norfolk
suit
is
shabby
already
and
winnie
sunday
frock
is
fit
to
be
seen
as
to
their
boots
i
sometimes
think
i
shall
have
to
let
them
go
other
people
children
do
seem
to
give
half
the
trouble
that
mine
do
look
at
them
now
dragging
lulu
down
the
sands
when
i
told
them
she
must
get
overheated
on
any
account
the
doctor
said
we
were
to
be
so
careful
of
her
and
keep
her
quiet
but
it
seems
no
use
she
run
after
the
others
oh
dear
i
ca
allow
them
to
turn
her
head
over
heels
like
that
and
rokeby
flew
to
the
rescue
of
her
delicate
youngest
administering
a
vigorous
scolding
to
the
elder
ones
which
apparently
made
as
little
impression
upon
them
as
water
on
a
duck
back
the
untidy
appearance
and
unruly
behaviour
of
her
undisciplined
flock
were
really
a
trial
to
rokeby
since
they
generally
managed
to
compare
unfavourably
with
the
wrights
a
stolid
and
family
who
were
staying
in
rooms
near
the
station
you
never
see
charlotte
wright
with
her
dress
torn
to
ribbons
or
her
hair
in
her
eyes
she
would
remonstrate
with
letty
and
winnie
both
she
and
aggie
can
wear
their
sailor
blouses
for
three
days
while
yours
are
fit
to
be
seen
at
the
end
of
a
morning
the
wrights
are
so
stupid
replied
winnie
you
can
hardly
get
them
to
have
any
fun
at
all
they
spend
nearly
the
whole
time
with
that
mademoiselle
they
brought
with
them
they
so
proud
of
her
they
do
nothing
but
let
off
french
remarks
just
to
try
to
impress
us
she
only
a
holiday
governess
too
they
do
have
her
when
they
at
home
so
there
no
need
for
them
to
give
themselves
such
airs
about
it
i
believe
their
french
is
anything
much
either
they
put
in
so
many
english
words
arthur
wright
actually
brings
his
books
down
on
to
the
shore
said
letty
and
does
greek
and
euclid
half
the
morning
he
says
he
working
for
a
scholarship
you
would
catch
hugh
or
cecil
at
that
i
afraid
i
should
sighed
rokeby
to
judge
from
their
bad
reports
at
school
it
seems
difficult
enough
to
get
them
to
learn
anything
in
term
time
as
for
mademoiselle
you
might
take
the
opportunity
to
talk
to
her
a
little
and
improve
your
own
french
no
thank
you
said
winnie
pulling
a
wry
face
no
holiday
lessons
for
me
i
loathe
french
and
i
never
can
understand
a
single
word
that
mademoiselle
says
so
it
no
use
if
the
wrights
like
to
sit
on
the
sand
and
they
may
they
so
fat
they
ca
rush
about
like
we
do
that
why
they
keep
so
tidy
charlotte
waist
is
exactly
twice
as
big
as
mine
we
measured
them
yesterday
with
a
piece
of
string
and
aggie
cheeks
are
as
round
as
puddings
you
should
see
how
they
all
pant
when
they
play
cricket
they
scarcely
get
any
runs
and
they
really
eat
far
more
even
than
we
do
mother
said
letty
aggie
had
five
buns
on
the
shore
yesterday
and
eric
took
sixteen
biscuits
i
know
he
did
for
we
counted
them
and
he
nearly
emptied
the
box
the
chesters
are
five
times
as
jolly
declared
winnie
both
charlie
and
hilda
went
out
shrimping
with
us
this
morning
and
got
sopping
wet
but
they
did
mind
in
the
least
and
chester
only
laughed
when
they
went
back
she
said
sea
water
did
hurt
she
far
nicer
than
barrington
i
would
be
ruth
barrington
for
all
the
world
she
and
edna
never
have
any
breakfast
and
they
made
to
do
the
queerest
things
the
unlucky
little
barringtons
were
possessed
of
parents
who
clung
to
theories
which
they
themselves
described
as
wholesome
ideas
and
their
friends
denounced
as
absurd
cranks
many
and
various
were
the
experiments
which
they
tried
upon
their
children
health
and
education
sometimes
with
rather
disastrous
results
being
at
present
enthusiastic
members
of
a
no
breakfast
league
which
held
that
two
meals
a
day
were
amply
sufficient
for
the
requirements
of
any
rational
human
being
they
had
limited
their
family
repasts
to
luncheon
and
supper
at
which
only
vegetarian
dishes
were
permitted
to
appear
and
the
poor
children
hungry
with
sea
air
and
with
running
about
on
the
sands
who
would
have
enjoyed
an
unstinted
supply
of
butcher
meat
and
bread
and
butter
were
carefully
dieted
on
plasmon
prepared
nuts
and
many
patent
foods
which
their
mother
measured
out
in
exact
portions
keeping
a
careful
record
in
her
diary
of
the
amount
they
were
allowed
to
consume
and
taking
the
pair
to
be
weighed
every
week
upon
the
automatic
machine
at
the
railway
station
their
costumes
consisted
of
plain
blue
pinafores
and
sandals
and
they
wore
neither
hats
nor
stockings
it
all
right
for
the
seaside
grumbled
ruth
to
her
intimate
friends
because
we
can
go
into
the
water
without
minding
getting
into
a
mess
but
we
have
to
wear
exactly
the
same
in
town
and
it
horrible
you
ca
think
how
every
one
stares
at
as
just
as
if
we
were
a
show
sometimes
ladies
stop
us
and
ask
our
governess
if
we
lost
our
hats
and
had
she
better
tie
our
handkerchiefs
over
our
heads
we
dare
to
go
out
alone
even
if
we
were
allowed
we
look
so
queer
we
went
once
to
the
post
by
ourselves
and
some
rude
boys
chased
us
all
the
way
calling
out
it
dreadfully
cold
in
winter
too
without
stockings
and
when
it
rains
our
heads
get
wet
through
and
we
have
to
be
dried
with
towels
when
we
come
in
again
i
wonder
why
we
ca
be
dressed
like
other
people
i
wish
i
had
belle
stuart
clothes
perfectly
lovely
ruth
rather
pathetic
little
face
always
bore
the
injured
expression
of
one
who
cherishes
a
grievance
she
was
a
thin
pale
child
who
did
not
look
as
though
she
flourished
upon
her
peculiar
system
of
bringing
up
which
seemed
to
have
the
unfortunate
effect
of
completely
spoiling
her
temper
and
making
her
see
life
through
an
extremely
blue
pair
of
spectacles
this
summer
she
certainly
thought
she
had
a
just
cause
of
complaint
since
her
two
schoolboy
brothers
instead
of
spending
their
holidays
as
usual
at
the
seaside
had
been
dispatched
on
a
to
switzerland
with
a
certain
german
professor
who
in
accordance
with
the
latest
educational
fad
was
conducting
a
select
little
party
of
boys
on
an
pilgrimage
the
main
features
of
which
seemed
to
be
to
walk
by
day
and
to
sleep
in
a
kind
of
wigwam
at
night
which
they
erected
out
of
alpenstocks
and
mackintoshes
it
too
disgusting
said
ruth
dolefully
just
when
edna
and
i
had
been
looking
forward
all
the
term
to
the
boys
coming
home
and
making
so
many
plans
of
what
we
would
do
and
the
fun
we
would
have
some
wretched
person
sent
father
a
copy
of
educational
with
a
long
account
of
this
horrid
and
he
said
it
was
the
exact
thing
for
clifford
and
keith
and
insisted
upon
arranging
it
at
once
i
think
mother
was
really
dreadfully
disappointed
i
believe
she
wanted
to
have
them
home
as
much
as
we
did
because
she
said
they
ought
to
go
to
the
dentist
and
she
must
look
over
their
clothes
and
she
should
like
to
give
them
some
phosphates
tonic
but
father
said
they
could
have
their
teeth
attended
to
at
geneva
and
she
could
send
the
tonic
to
the
professor
and
ask
him
to
see
that
they
took
it
i
know
the
boys
will
be
furious
they
hate
taking
medicine
they
generally
keep
it
in
their
mouths
and
spit
it
out
afterwards
they
have
to
talk
german
all
day
long
too
and
they
ca
bear
that
you
no
idea
how
they
detest
languages
i
had
a
picture
from
clifford
yesterday
and
he
said
his
feet
were
horribly
sore
with
walking
and
his
tent
blew
away
one
night
and
he
was
obliged
to
sleep
in
the
open
air
no
greater
contrast
could
be
found
to
the
barringtons
than
the
chester
children
charlie
the
elder
a
lively
young
pickle
of
twelve
was
on
terms
of
great
intimacy
with
all
the
fishermen
and
sailor
boys
whose
acquaintance
he
could
cultivate
talking
in
a
learned
manner
of
jibs
gaffs
booms
and
bowsprits
and
using
every
nautical
term
he
could
manage
to
pick
up
he
had
a
very
good
idea
of
rowing
and
would
often
persuade
the
men
to
let
him
go
out
with
them
in
their
boats
taking
his
turn
at
an
oar
much
to
their
amusement
and
setting
log
lines
with
the
serious
air
of
a
practised
hand
his
jolly
friendly
ways
won
him
general
favour
and
he
was
allowed
to
make
himself
at
home
on
many
of
the
little
fishing
smacks
learning
to
hoist
sails
to
steer
and
to
cast
nets
though
sometimes
a
too
inquiring
mind
led
him
to
interfere
on
his
own
account
in
the
navigation
with
the
result
that
he
would
be
unceremoniously
bundled
back
to
shore
again
with
a
warning
to
keep
out
of
this
in
the
future
he
was
the
envy
of
his
sister
hilda
who
would
have
liked
to
follow
him
through
thick
and
thin
but
the
sailors
drew
the
line
at
little
girls
and
would
politely
request
missy
to
return
home
to
her
ma
as
there
was
no
place
for
her
on
this
craft
much
to
her
indignation
she
consoled
herself
however
by
organizing
the
games
of
the
younger
wrights
and
rokebys
making
wonderful
sand
harbours
with
their
aid
and
sailing
a
fleet
of
toy
boats
with
as
keen
an
enthusiasm
as
if
they
were
real
ones
at
the
end
of
a
morning
on
the
common
isobel
found
herself
on
quite
an
intimate
footing
with
the
wrights
the
rokebys
the
barringtons
and
the
chesters
besides
being
a
duly
elected
member
of
the
united
sea
urchins
recreation
society
i
never
had
such
fun
in
my
life
she
confided
to
her
mother
at
we
played
cricket
and
then
we
went
along
the
shore
because
the
tide
was
so
low
i
picked
up
the
most
beautiful
screw
shells
and
razor
shells
and
fan
shells
you
ever
saw
i
had
to
put
them
in
my
pocket
handkerchief
because
i
had
a
basket
with
me
bertie
rokeby
got
into
a
quicksand
up
to
his
knees
and
lulu
sat
down
in
the
water
in
her
clothes
you
must
come
and
see
our
club
ground
mother
when
you
can
walk
so
far
we
have
it
quite
to
ourselves
for
it
right
behind
the
cliff
and
none
of
the
other
visitors
seem
to
have
found
it
out
yet
and
if
anybody
else
tries
to
take
it
the
boys
say
they
mean
to
turn
them
off
because
we
got
it
first
they
all
going
to
carry
their
tea
there
this
afternoon
and
light
a
fire
of
to
boil
the
kettle
so
may
i
go
too
and
then
we
shall
play
cricket
again
in
the
evening
chapter
v
a
hot
friendship
i
was
a
child
and
she
was
a
child
in
this
kingdom
by
the
sea
by
the
time
isobel
had
been
a
week
at
silversands
she
had
begun
to
feel
as
much
at
home
there
as
the
oldest
inhabitant
she
had
won
golden
opinions
from
jackson
at
the
lodgings
and
had
been
invited
by
that
worthy
woman
into
the
upper
during
the
temporary
absence
of
its
occupiers
and
shown
a
most
fascinating
cabinet
full
of
foreign
shells
stuffed
birds
corals
ivory
bangles
boxes
and
other
curiosities
brought
home
by
a
sailor
son
who
made
many
voyages
to
the
east
do
you
wish
you
could
have
gone
with
him
and
got
all
these
things
for
yourself
said
isobel
ecstatically
when
she
had
examined
and
admired
every
article
separately
and
heard
its
history
nay
replied
jackson
i
never
had
no
mind
for
shipboard
though
my
second
cousin
was
stewardess
on
a
channel
steamer
for
a
matter
of
fifteen
year
and
made
a
tidy
sum
out
of
it
too
she
could
have
got
me
taken
on
by
the
anchor
line
as
runs
to
america
if
i
have
signed
for
two
years
that
was
when
my
first
husband
died
and
afore
i
married
jackson
but
i
felt
i
rather
starve
on
dry
land
than
take
it
though
it
was
good
wages
they
offered
to
say
nothing
of
tips
why
it
would
be
glorious
to
go
to
america
said
isobel
sighing
to
think
what
her
companion
had
missed
you
might
have
seen
red
indians
and
wigwams
and
medicine
men
and
of
fur
and
belts
of
wampum
like
it
talks
of
in
do
you
know
there
were
an
old
steamer
of
that
name
used
to
trade
from
liverpool
in
hides
and
tallow
when
i
were
a
girl
if
that
the
one
you
mean
i
wonder
she
has
foundered
afore
now
oh
no
cried
isobel
hastily
it
is
a
steamer
it
a
piece
of
poetry
i
just
been
reading
it
with
mother
and
it
most
delightful
i
could
lend
it
to
you
if
you
like
we
brought
the
book
with
us
jackson
acquaintance
with
the
muse
however
seemed
to
be
limited
to
the
hymns
in
church
and
a
hazy
remembrance
of
certain
pieces
in
her
spelling
book
when
a
child
and
being
apparently
unwilling
to
further
cultivate
her
mind
in
that
direction
she
declined
the
offer
on
the
score
of
lack
of
time
not
but
what
jackson
fond
of
a
bit
of
poetry
now
and
again
she
admitted
he
sings
a
good
song
or
two
when
he
in
the
mood
and
he
do
like
readin
over
the
verses
on
the
funeral
cards
he
pins
them
all
up
on
the
kitchen
wall
where
he
can
get
at
them
handy
what
suits
me
more
is
something
in
the
way
of
a
romance
gwendolen
lovers
or
black
duke
secret
when
i
time
to
take
up
a
book
which
often
with
three
sets
of
lodgers
in
the
house
and
a
girl
as
ca
even
remember
how
to
make
a
bed
properly
to
say
nothing
of
laying
a
table
and
take
the
dinner
up
to
the
the
polly
though
certainly
not
an
accomplished
waitress
was
the
most
of
girls
and
an
invaluable
ally
in
saving
the
treasured
specimens
of
flowers
or
which
jackson
in
her
praiseworthy
efforts
at
tidiness
was
continually
clearing
out
under
the
plea
that
she
had
imagined
they
could
be
wanted
she
even
threw
away
my
mermaids
purses
and
the
whelks
eggs
that
we
found
on
the
said
isobel
to
her
mother
but
polly
climbed
into
the
ashpit
and
grubbed
them
up
again
she
washed
them
in
a
bucket
of
water
and
they
quite
nice
now
so
i
shall
put
them
in
a
box
to
make
sure
they
be
safe
polly
father
is
part
owner
of
a
schooner
and
sometimes
they
fish
up
the
most
enormous
fan
shells
she
says
ask
him
to
give
me
a
few
when
she
time
to
go
home
but
she
has
had
a
night
out
for
nearly
three
weeks
the
season
been
so
busy
perhaps
old
biddy
could
get
you
some
large
fan
shells
suggested
stewart
i
believe
they
find
them
sometimes
very
far
out
on
the
beach
when
they
shrimping
biddy
was
a
character
in
silversands
she
was
a
lively
old
irishwoman
with
the
strongest
of
brogues
and
the
most
beguiling
of
tongues
in
a
blue
check
apron
and
with
a
red
shawl
tied
over
her
head
she
might
be
seen
every
morning
wheeling
her
barrow
down
the
parade
where
her
amusing
powers
of
blarney
added
to
the
freshness
of
her
fish
secured
her
a
large
circle
of
customers
among
what
she
called
the
quality
she
had
a
wonderful
memory
for
faces
and
always
recognized
families
who
paid
a
second
visit
to
the
town
why
it
niver
masther
charlie
sure
she
exclaimed
with
delight
on
meeting
the
chesters
one
day
it
meself
that
knew
the
bright
face
of
yez
the
moment
i
saw
ut
though
ye
growed
such
a
foine
young
gintleman
an
all
ye
was
staying
at
no
two
years
back
with

holy

this
must
be
herself
and
none
other
for
it
not
twice
ye
see
such
a
pair
of
eyes
and
forgit
them
what
became
of
biddy
during
the
winter
when
there
were
no
visitors
to
buy
her
fish
was
an
unsolved
mystery
sure
i
makes
what
i
can
by
the
koindness
of
sthrangers
during
the
summer
toime
she
had
replied
when
isobel
once
sounded
her
on
the
subject
there
many
a
one
as
gives
me
an
extra
penny
or
two
or
says
the
change
biddy
mulligan
the
blessed
virgin
reward

thank
you
kindly

took
the
hint

your
bed
in
heaven
be
aisy
and
may
ye
niver
lack
a
copper
to
give
to
them
as
needs
it
besides
biddy
isobel
had
a
number
of
other
acquaintances
in
silversands
there
was
the
coastguard
at
the
cottage
on
the
top
of
the
cliffs
who
sometimes
allowed
her
to
look
through
his
telescope
and
who
had
an
interesting
barometer
in
the
shape
of
a
cottage
with
two
doors
from
one
of
which
a
little
soldier
appeared
when
it
was
going
to
be
fine
while
a
gentleman
in
a
blue
jacket
came
out
to
give
warning
of
wet
weather
then
there
was
the
owner
of
the
pleasure
boats
who
had
promised
to
take
her
for
a
row
entirely
free
of
charge
on
the
day
before
she
was
going
home
and
the
bathing
woman
who
always
tried
to
keep
for
her
the
van
with
the
blue
stripes
and
the
brass
hooks
inside
because
she
knew
she
liked
it
the
donkey
boy
had
christened
the
special
favourite
with
the
new
harness
donkey
and
made
it
go
with
unwonted
speed
even
on
the
outward
journey
as
a
rule
it
galloped
of
its
own
accord
when
its
nose
was
turned
towards
home
and
the
blind
harpist
by
the
railway
station
had
waxed
quite
confidential
on
the
subject
of
scottish
ballads
and
had
allowed
her
to
try
his
instrument
as
for
the
members
of
the
sea
urchins
club
she
felt
as
if
she
had
known
them
all
her
life
and
the
sayings
and
doings
of
the
chesters
the
rokebys
the
wrights
and
the
barringtons
occupied
a
large
part
of
her
conversation
jolly
as
they
were
none
of
them
in
isobel
estimation
could
compare
with
belle
stuart
who
from
the
first
had
claimed
her
as
her
particular
chum
the
two
managed
to
spend
nearly
the
whole
of
every
day
together
sometimes
in
company
with
the
other
children
or
sometimes
alone
on
the
beach
hunting
for
shells
and
sea
anemones
picking
flowers
or
just
sitting
talking
in
delicious
idleness
under
the
shade
of
a
rock
listening
to
the
dash
of
the
waves
and
the
screams
of
the
sea
gulls
which
were
following
the
tide
i
not
generally
allowed
to
make
friends
with
any
one
whom
we
know
at
home
belle
had
confided
frankly
but
mother
said
you
looked
such
a
very
nice
little
girl
she
thought
it
would
matter
just
for
this
once
i
told
her
your
father
had
been
an
officer
and
she
said
of
course
that
made
a
difference
but
i
really
was
to
be
careful
and
not
pick
up
odd
acquaintances
upon
the
beach
for
she
does
want
me
to
talk
to
all
sorts
of
people
who
are
in
our
set
of
society
and
might
be
very
awkward
to
get
rid
of
afterwards
isobel
did
not
reply
she
would
never
have
dreamt
of
explaining
that
it
was
only
due
to
her
most
urgent
entreaties
that
she
on
her
part
had
been
allowed
to
pursue
the
friendship
stewart
from
somewhat
different
motives
was
quite
as
particular
as
belle
mother
about
chance
acquaintances
and
had
been
a
little
doubtful
as
to
whether
she
was
acting
wisely
in
allowing
isobel
to
spend
so
much
of
her
time
with
companions
of
whom
she
knew
nothing
and
whether
this
new
influence
was
such
as
she
would
altogether
wish
for
her
but
i
ca
keep
her
wrapped
up
in
cotton
wool
she
thought
she
has
been
such
a
lonely
child
that
it
only
right
and
natural
she
should
like
to
make
friends
of
her
own
age
especially
when
i
not
able
to
go
about
with
her
she
have
to
face
life
some
time
and
the
sooner
she
begins
to
be
able
to
distinguish
the
wheat
from
the
chaff
so
much
the
better
thus
far
i
perhaps
guarded
her
too
carefully
and
this
is
an
excellent
opportunity
of
throwing
her
on
her
own
resources
i
think
i
can
trust
her
to
stick
to
what
she
knows
is
right
and
not
be
led
astray
by
any
silly
notions
she
soon
discover
that
money
and
fine
clothes
do
represent
the
highest
in
life
and
i
believe
it
best
to
let
her
find
it
out
gradually
for
herself
she
like
a
little
bird
learning
to
fly
i
kept
her
long
enough
in
the
nest
and
now
i
must
stand
aside
and
leave
her
to
try
her
wings
for
the
present
at
any
rate
isobel
could
see
no
fault
in
her
new
friend
belle
had
completely
won
her
heart
her
charming
looks
her
fair
fluffy
curls
her
little
spoilt
coaxing
ways
the
clinging
manner
in
which
she
seemed
to
depend
upon
others
her
very
helplessness
and
heedlessness
even
the
artless
openness
with
which
she
sought
for
admiration
all
appealed
with
an
irresistible
force
to
isobel
stronger
nature
if
it
ever
struck
her
that
her
companion
was
lacking
in
some
of
those
qualities
which
she
had
been
taught
to
consider
necessary
she
thrust
the
thought
away
as
a
kind
of
disloyalty
and
if
it
were
she
who
generally
carried
the
heavy
basket
searched
for
the
lost
ball
fetched
forgotten
articles
or
did
any
of
the
countless
small
services
which
belle
exacted
almost
as
a
matter
of
course
from
those
around
her
it
certainly
was
without
any
idea
of
complaint
there
are
in
this
world
always
those
who
love
and
those
who
are
loved
and
isobel
was
ready
with
spendthrift
generosity
to
offer
her
utmost
in
the
way
of
friendship
finding
belle
pretty
thanks
and
kisses
a
sufficient
reward
for
any
trouble
she
might
take
on
her
account
and
perhaps
unconsciously
realizing
that
even
in
our
affections
it
is
the
givers
more
than
the
receivers
who
are
the
truly
blessed
belle
who
usually
found
a
brief
and
fleeting
attraction
in
any
new
friend
was
pleased
with
devotion
and
ready
to
be
admired
petted
and
waited
on
to
any
extent
i
think
too
that
to
do
her
justice
she
was
really
an
affectionate
child
and
at
the
time
she
was
as
fond
of
her
friend
as
it
was
possible
for
her
light
little
character
to
be
she
would
not
have
troubled
to
put
herself
out
of
the
way
for
isobel
and
it
would
not
have
broken
her
heart
to
part
with
her
but
she
enjoyed
her
company
and
easily
gave
her
the
first
place
among
the
dozen
bosom
friends
each
of
whom
she
had
taken
up
in
turn
and
thrown
aside
one
particular
afternoon
found
the
namesakes
strolling
arm
in
arm
along
the
narrow
sandy
lane
which
led
inland
from
the
beach
towards
the
woods
and
the
hills
behind
it
was
the
most
delightful
lane
with
high
grassy
banks
covered
with
pink
bindweed
and
tiny
blue
sheep
scabious
and
bright
masses
of
yellow
bedstraw
and
great
clumps
of
mallows
with
on
them
just
like
little
cheeses
which
you
could
gather
and
thread
on
pieces
of
cotton
to
make
necklaces
there
was
a
hedge
at
the
top
of
the
bank
too
where
grew
the
beautiful
twining
briony
with
its
dark
leaves
and
glossy
berries
and
long
trails
of
bramble
where
a
few
early
blackberries
could
be
discovered
if
you
cared
to
reach
for
them
and
down
among
the
sand
at
the
bottom
of
the
ditch
you
might
find
an
occasional
horned
poppy
or
the
curious
flowers
and
glaucous
prickly
leaves
of
the
sea
holly
isobel
on
the
strength
of
a
new
tin
vasculum
purchased
only
that
very
morning
at
the
near
the
station
and
slung
over
her
shoulder
in
the
style
of
a
student
in
a
german
felt
herself
to
be
a
botanist
and
rushed
about
in
a
very
enthusiastic
manner
scrambling
up
the
banks
after
pink
centaury
diving
into
the
hedge
bottom
for
campions
or
getting
her
hair
caught
like
absalom
in
a
prickly
in
a
valiant
endeavour
to
secure
a
particularly
fine
clump
of
harebells
which
were
nodding
in
the
breeze
on
the
stones
of
the
old
wall
they
perfectly
lovely
are
they
she
cried
i
got
fourteen
different
sorts
of
flowers
already
and
i
sure
some
of
them
must
be
rare
anyway
i
never
seen
them
before
i
going
to
press
them
directly
i
get
home
do
you
think
this
stump
will
bear
me
if
i
climb
up
for
that
piece
of
briony
i
afraid
it
wo
said
belle
fastening
some
of
the
harebells
in
her
dress
they
matched
her
blue
sash
and
hat
ribbons
it
looks
fearfully
rotten
there
i
told
you
it
would
hold
as
isobel
descended
with
a
crash
and
you
covered
with
sand
and
prickly
burrs
such
a
mess
never
mind
said
isobel
the
state
of
whose
clothing
rarely
distressed
her
they
brush
off
but
i
must
have
the
briony
i
climb
up
by
the
wall
if
you
hold
these
hips
for
a
moment
oh
do
come
along
that
a
darling
entreated
belle
i
do
want
to
wait
they
only
wild
things
after
all
i
wish
you
could
see
our
garden
at
home
full
of
lovely
geraniums
and
fuchsias
and
lobelias
and
the
orchids
and
gloxinias
in
the
conservatory
they
really
worth
looking
at
carter
our
gardener
takes
tremendous
pains
with
them
and
he
gets
heaps
of
prizes
at
shows
but
i
like
wild
flowers
best
said
isobel
you
can
find
them
yourself
in
the
hedges
and
there
are
so
many
kinds
it
most
exciting
to
hunt
out
their
names
in
the
botany
book
do
you
care
for
botany
said
belle
i
have
it
with
miss
fairfax
and
i
think
it
hateful
all
about
corollas
and
stigmas
and
panicles
and
umbels
and
stupid
long
words
i
ca
either
remember
or
understand
i
have
learnt
any
proper
botany
yet
said
isobel
only
just
some
of
the
easy
part
but
when
we
come
into
the
country
mother
and
i
always
hunt
for
wild
flowers
and
then
we
press
them
and
paste
them
into
a
book
and
write
the
names
underneath
we
have
different
sorts
at
home
and
i
found
sixteen
new
ones
since
i
came
here
so
i
think
that
rather
good
considering
we
only
been
at
silversands
a
week
how
hot
it
is
in
this
lane
suppose
we
go
round
by
the
station
and
up
the
cliffs
the
little
lane
with
its
high
banks
was
certainly
the
most
baking
spot
they
could
have
chosen
for
a
walk
on
a
blazing
august
afternoon
the
sun
poured
down
with
a
steady
glare
till
the
air
seemed
to
quiver
with
the
heat
and
the
only
things
which
really
enjoyed
themselves
were
the
grasshoppers
whose
cheery
chirpings
kept
up
a
perpetual
concert
in
the
fields
on
either
side
the
reapers
had
been
busy
and
harvesters
were
hard
at
work
binding
the
yellow
corn
and
the
scarlet
poppies
into
sheaves
little
groups
of
mothers
and
children
and
babies
had
come
to
help
or
look
on
as
the
case
might
be
and
brought
with
them
cans
of
tea
and
checked
handkerchiefs
full
of
bread
and
butter
do
they
look
jolly
said
isobel
peeping
over
the
hedge
to
watch
a
family
who
were
picnicking
among
the
stooks
the
father
in
a
rush
hat
his
corduroy
trousers
tied
up
with
wisps
of
straw
wiping
his
hot
forehead
on
his
shirt
sleeves
the
mother
putting
the
baby
to
roll
on
the
corn
while
she
poured
the
tea
into
blue
mugs
and
the
children
as
brown
as
gypsies
sitting
round
in
a
circle
eating
slices
of
bread
and
evidently
enjoying
the
fun
of
the
thing
said
belle
somewhat
doubtfully
i
suppose
they
do
are
you
fond
of
poor
people
i
like
going
with
mother
when
she
because
the
women
often
let
me
nurse
the
babies
some
of
them
are
so
sweet
come
to
me
and
not
be
shy
at
all
are
they
rather
dirty
no
not
most
of
them
a
few
are
beautifully
clean
mother
says
she
expects
they
know
which
day
we
coming
and
wash
them
on
purpose
babies
are
all
very
well
when
they
nicely
dressed
in
white
frocks
and
lace
and
corals
remarked
belle
so
long
as
they
do
pull
your
hair
and
scratch
your
face
one
day
continued
isobel
we
went
to
the
that
a
place
where
poor
people
children
are
taken
care
of
during
the
day
while
their
mothers
are
out
working
there
were
forty
little
babies
in
cots
round
a
large
room
pets
and
so
happy
not
one
of
them
was
crying
the
nurse
said
they
generally
howl
for
a
day
or
two
after
they
first
brought
in
and
then
they
get
used
to
it
and
do
bother
any
more
you
see
it
would
do
to
take
up
every
single
baby
each
time
it
began
to
cry
i
wish
you
tell
that
to
the
wrights
they
give
that
of
theirs
whatever
she
shrieks
for
she
a
nasty
spoilt
little
thing
yesterday
she
caught
hold
of
my
pearl
locket
and
tugged
it
so
hard
she
nearly
strangled
me
and
broke
the
chain
and
the
locket
fell
into
a
pool
and
i
could
find
it
though
i
hunted
for
half
an
hour
the
nurse
only
babbled
on
pet
did
she
get
the
pretty
locket
then
i
felt
so
cross
i
wanted
to
smack
both
her
and
the
baby
and
have
you
found
the
locket
yet
no
and
i
never
shall
now
it
been
high
tide
since
then
what
a
shame
i
should
have
felt
dreadfully
angry
i
do
like
the
wrights
nurse
either
she
borrowed
my
new
white
basket
and
then
let
the
children
have
it
and
they
picked
blackberries
into
it
and
stained
it
horribly
why
there
aggie
wright
now
with
the
rokebys
what
they
doing
they
hanging
over
that
gate
in
the
most
peculiar
manner
let
us
go
and
see
chapter
vi
on
the
cliffs
we
saw
the
great
ocean
ablaze
in
the
sun
and
heard
the
deep
roar
of
the
waves
the
gate
in
question
proved
to
be
the
level
crossing
which
had
just
been
closed
by
the
man
from
the
to
allow
a
train
to
pass
through
charlotte
and
aggie
wright
and
five
of
the
rokebys
were
all
standing
upon
the
bars
hanging
over
the
top
rail
and
gazing
at
the
metals
with
such
deep
and
intense
interest
that
you
would
have
thought
they
expected
a
railway
accident
at
the
very
least
and
were
looking
out
for
the
smash
what
the
matter
cried
belle
and
isobel
racing
up
to
share
in
whatever
excitement
might
be
on
hand
do
you
see
anything
is
it
a
cow
on
the
line
no
said
bertie
rokeby
balancing
himself
rather
insecurely
upon
the
gate
post
we
only
waiting
for
the
train
to
pass
we
put
pennies
on
the
rail
and
the
wheels
going
over
them
will
flatten
them
out
till
they
nearly
twice
as
big
you
hardly
believe
what
a
difference
it
makes
would
you
like
to
try
one
i
just
have
time
to
climb
down
and
put
it
on
before
the
train
comes
up
i
will
in
a
minute
if
you
say
the
word
i
have
a
penny
with
me
i
afraid
answered
isobel
rummaging
in
her
pockets
and
turning
out
several
interesting
pebbles
a
few
shells
a
mermaid
purse
and
the
remains
of
a
spider
crab
stop
a
moment
no
it
only
a
button
after
all
and
a
horn
one
too
that
would
be
smashed
to
smithereens
if
it
had
been
a
metal
one
i
have
tried
it
i
nothing
but
a
halfpenny
said
belle
it
all
i
possess
in
the
world
till
when
i
get
my
but
do
put
it
on
bertie
it
would
be
fun
to
see
how
large
it
makes
it
bertie
climbed
over
the
gate
and
popped
the
coin
with
the
others
on
the
rail
much
to
the
agitation
of
the
pointsman
who
ran
in
great
anger
from
the
shouting
to
him
to
get
off
the
line
for
the
train
was
coming
he
was
barely
in
time
for
in
another
moment
the
express
came
whirling
by
with
such
a
roar
and
a
rattle
and
making
such
a
blast
of
wind
as
it
went
that
the
children
had
to
shut
their
eyes
and
cling
on
tightly
you
get
into
trouble
here
if
you
get
over
them
bars
when
i
shut
grunted
the
pointsman
surlily
opening
the
gates
to
admit
a
waiting
cart
from
the
other
side
i
take
your
name
next
time
as
you
tries
it
on
and
report
you
to
the
inspector
and
you
get
charged
with
trespassing
on
the
company
property
oh
bother
cried
bertie
i
was
doing
any
harm
i
can
take
jolly
good
care
of
myself
so
do
you
worry
about
me
and
he
rushed
impatiently
after
the
others
who
were
already
picking
up
their
pennies
from
the
rail
it
crushed
them
ever
so
flat
exclaimed
aggie
wright
triumphantly
holding
up
a
dinted
copper
which
seemed
to
be
several
sizes
too
large
you
can
scarcely
see
which
is
heads
and
which
is
tails
said
arnold
rokeby
just
look
at
my
halfpenny
said
belle
it
twice
as
big
as
it
was
before
why
so
it
is
any
one
would
take
it
for
a
penny
if
they
did
look
at
it
closely
come
along
they
want
to
shut
the
gates
again
for
a
luggage
train
and
we
shall
have
to
clear
out
we
all
going
to
the
steps
are
you
two
coming
with
us
no
i
think
not
replied
belle
it
too
hot
to
walk
so
far
isobel
and
i
just
want
to
stroll
about
then
we
come
along
cecil
for
goodness
sake
go
grubbing
in
the
hedge
now
after
caterpillars
even
if
it
a
woolly
bear
you
find
plenty
more
another
here
arnold
you
young
monkey
give
me
my
cap
and
the
rokebys
tore
away
up
the
road
with
a
characteristic
energy
that
even
the
blazing
august
heat
could
not
quench
if
we
go
behind
hunt
farm
said
isobel
we
can
turn
up
the
path
to
the
churchyard
and
get
on
to
the
cliffs
just
over
the
quay
it
a
short
cut
and
much
nicer
than
the
road
so
they
crossed
the
line
again
by
the
footbridge
passing
the
station
where
the
porter
overcome
with
the
heat
was
having
a
comfortable
snooze
on
his
then
facing
towards
the
sea
they
climbed
the
steep
track
which
zigzagged
up
the
face
of
the
cliff
to
the
old
church
the
door
was
open
and
the
children
stole
inside
for
a
minute
and
stood
quietly
gazing
round
the
nave
it
was
cool
and
shady
there
with
the
rich
glow
from
the
windows
falling
in
checkered
rays
of
blue
and
crimson
and
orange
upon
the
twisted
pillars
and
the
carved
oak
pews
the
choir
was
practising
in
the
chancel
and
as
they
sang
the
sun
slanting
through
the
diamond
panes
of
the
south
transept
made
a
very
halo
of
glory
round
the
head
of
the
ancient
monument
of
alcuin
the
saxon
abbot
below
crosier
and
mitre
had
long
ago
been
chipped
away
by
the
ruthless
hands
of
cromwell
soldiers
but
they
had
spared
the
face
and
the
light
shone
full
on
the
closed
eyes
and
the
calm
sleeping
mouth
isobel
moved
a
little
nearer
trying
to
spell
out
the
letters
of
the
inscription
she
knew
the
story
of
how
the
pagan
norsemen
had
sacked
the
abbey
and
had
murdered
the
abbot
on
the
steps
of
the
altar
where
he
had
remained
alone
to
pray
when
his
monks
had
fled
to
safety
but
the
words
were
in
latin
and
she
could
not
read
them
for
all
the
saints
who
from
their
labours
rest
chanted
the
choir
softly
the
music
of
their
voices
mingling
strangely
with
the
shouts
of
the
children
at
play
which
rose
up
from
the
beach
below
he
looks
as
though
he
were
resting
thought
isobel
not
dead
only
just
sleeping
until
he
was
wanted
again
i
suppose
he
one
of
the
in
light
now
what
a
long
long
time
it
is
since
he
lived
here
i
wonder
if
he
knows
they
built
a
church
and
called
it
after
him
here
the
verger
coming
whispered
belle
pulling
at
her
hand
i
think
we
better
go
let
us
sit
down
shall
we
said
isobel
when
they
were
out
in
the
glare
of
the
sunshine
once
more
on
the
broad
flagged
path
which
led
from
the
church
door
to
the
steps
looking
down
on
to
the
sea
not
here
though
replied
belle
i
do
like
gravestones
they
make
me
feel
horrid
and
creepy
under
the
then
suggested
isobel
it
be
cooler
for
it
in
the
shade
and
there
a
seat
too
what
a
simply
broiling
day
said
belle
settling
herself
as
luxuriously
as
possible
in
the
corner
and
pulling
off
her
hat
to
fan
her
hot
face
i
do
like
such
heat
as
this
it
takes
my
hair
out
of
curl
tenderly
twisting
one
of
her
flaxen
ringlets
into
its
proper
orthodox
droop
it
jolly
here
we
get
a
little
wind
and
we
can
watch
everything
all
round
said
isobel
sitting
with
her
chin
in
her
hands
and
gazing
over
the
water
to
where
the
herring
fleet
was
tacking
back
to
the
harbour
the
children
could
scarcely
have
chosen
a
sweeter
spot
to
rest
below
them
lay
the
sea
a
broad
flat
expanse
of
blue
getting
a
little
hazy
gray
on
the
horizon
and
with
a
greenish
ripple
where
it
neared
the
rocks
upon
which
its
waves
were
always
dashing
with
a
dull
booming
sound
the
old
town
with
its
red
roofs
and
gardens
made
such
a
spot
of
brightness
against
the
blue
sea
that
it
suggested
the
brilliant
colouring
of
a
foreign
port
all
the
more
so
in
contrast
to
the
gray
tower
of
the
church
behind
and
the
yew
trees
which
had
somehow
managed
to
survive
the
winter
storms
the
grass
had
been
mown
in
the
churchyard
and
filled
the
air
with
a
fragrant
scent
of
hay
a
big
buzzed
noisily
over
a
bed
of
wild
thyme
under
the
wall
and
a
swallow
was
feeding
a
row
of
young
ones
upon
the
ridged
roof
of
the
sexton
cottage
in
the
great
stretch
of
blue
above
the
little
fleecy
clouds
formed
themselves
into
snowy
mountains
with
valleys
and
lakes
between
a
kind
of
dream
country
in
purest
white
and
isobel
wondered
whether
if
one
could
sail
straight
on
to
the
very
verge
of
the
distance
where
sea
and
sky
seemed
to
meet
one
could
slip
altogether
over
the
invisible
line
that
bounds
the
horizon
and
find
oneself
floating
in
that
cloudland
region
it
like
the
edge
of
heaven
she
thought
i
think
the
saints
must
live
there
and
the
cherubim
and
seraphim
much
farther
and
higher
up
right
in
the
blue
part
one
could
never
see
but
perhaps
sometimes
on
a
day
like
this
the
saints
might
come
back
a
little
way
out
of
the
light
and
nearer
to
the
earth
where
they
used
to
live
and
if
one
looked
very
hard
one
might
manage
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
them
just
where
the
sun
shining
on
that
white
piece
o
blest
communion
fellowship
divine
we
feebly
struggle
they
in
glory
shine
came
wafted
through
the
open
church
door
the
sound
of
the
singing
rather
far
off
and
subdued
seeming
to
join
in
harmony
with
the
lap
of
the
waves
the
hum
of
the
bees
the
cries
of
the
the
twittering
of
the
swallows
and
all
the
other
glad
voices
of
nature
it
looked
such
a
beautiful
joyful
delightful
glorious
world
that
isobel
sat
very
quietly
for
a
time
just
drinking
in
the
sweet
air
and
the
sunshine
and
feeling
without
exactly
knowing
why
that
it
was
good
to
be
there
are
you
asleep
said
belle
at
last
in
an
injured
tone
you
spoken
to
me
for
at
least
five
minutes
i
sure
it
must
be
getting
near
let
us
go
now
all
right
said
isobel
recalling
herself
with
a
start
she
had
almost
forgotten
belle
existence
for
the
moment
it
so
nice
on
these
steps
one
feels
as
if
one
were
up
above
everything
it
like
being
on
the
roof
of
the
world
perhaps
that
was
why
alcuin
and
the
monks
built
the
abbey
here
it
seems
so
very
near
to
the
sky
what
a
queer
girl
you
are
sometimes
said
belle
looking
at
her
curiously
i
believe
you
fond
of
old
churches
and
monuments
come
along
we
buy
some
sweets
or
some
pears
as
we
go
home
it
was
a
change
indeed
from
the
cliff
top
to
the
bustle
and
noise
of
the
little
town
below
most
of
the
were
empty
in
the
market
for
the
stock
of
herrings
and
mackerel
had
been
sold
off
earlier
in
the
day
but
a
travelling
bazaar
was
in
full
swing
and
exhibited
a
bewildering
display
of
toys
mugs
tin
cans
corkscrews
and
many
other
wonderful
and
miscellaneous
articles
any
of
which
might
be
bought
for
the
sum
of
one
penny
the
main
street
narrow
and
twisting
ran
steeply
uphill
the
high
gabled
houses
crowding
each
other
as
if
they
were
trying
to
peep
over
one
another
shoulders
from
the
side
alleys
came
the
mingled
odours
of
and
frying
fish
and
a
persistent
peddler
hawking
brooms
shouted
himself
hoarse
in
his
efforts
to
sell
his
wares
under
the
wide
archway
at
the
corner
by
the
market
stood
a
tiny
where
piles
of
plums
and
early
apples
bunches
of
sweet
peas
and
dahlias
baskets
of
tomatoes
lettuces
broad
beans
cauliflowers
and
cabbages
were
set
forth
to
tempt
customers
there
are
the
most
pears
said
belle
peeping
through
the
small
square
panes
of
the
window
and
so
cheap
i
shall
go
in
and
get
some
yes
love
six
for
a
penny
said
the
woman
a
soul
as
belle
entered
the
shop
and
inquired
the
price
they
fine
and
ripe
now
and
wo
do
you
no
harm
a
did
you
say
and
picking
out
six
of
the
best
pears
she
put
them
into
a
paper
bag
and
handed
them
to
belle
who
turning
to
leave
the
shop
laid
down
on
the
counter
the
coin
which
she
had
placed
that
afternoon
on
the
railway
line
the
woman
did
not
look
at
it
particularly
but
naturally
supposing
from
the
size
that
it
was
a
penny
she
swept
it
carelessly
into
the
till
belle
belle
whispered
isobel
catching
her
friend
hastily
by
the
arm
as
she
went
out
through
the
door
do
you
know
what
you
done
you
paid
her
your
big
halfpenny
instead
of
a
penny
oh
did
i
said
belle
flushing
i
did
notice
i
never
looked
at
it
what
a
good
thing
i
saw
the
mistake
give
her
a
proper
penny
and
get
the
halfpenny
back
belle
fumbled
in
her
pocket
in
vain
i
do
believe
i
have
another
penny
after
all
she
said
at
last
i
thought
i
had
several
i
must
have
lost
them
while
we
were
up
on
the
cliffs
i
suppose
what
we
to
do
exclaimed
isobel
anxiously
we
ca
take
the
pears
when
we
have
paid
for
them
properly
it
would
be
stealing
i
bring
her
another
halfpenny
suggested
belle
but
suppose
before
that
she
looks
at
the
money
and
finds
out
think
we
have
been
trying
to
cheat
her
perhaps
she
wo
remember
who
gave
it
to
her
oh
but
that
would
make
it
any
better
said
isobel
look
here
let
us
take
back
the
bag
and
tell
her
we
paid
the
wrong
money
and
ask
her
to
give
us
only
half
the
pears
very
well
answered
belle
you
go
in
will
you
i
do
like
to
isobel
seized
the
parcel
and
quickly
the
shop
i
ever
so
sorry
she
said
breathlessly
but
we
find
we
made
such
a
dreadful
mistake
we
meant
to
give
you
a
penny
and
it
was
a
penny
at
all
only
a
halfpenny
squashed
out
flat
on
the
railway
line
so
please
will
you
take
back
half
the
pears
because
we
neither
of
us
have
a
proper
penny
in
our
pockets
the
woman
laughed
i
did
think
to
notice
what
you
give
me
she
said
but
you
an
honest
little
girl
to
come
and
tell
me
no
i
wo
take
back
none
of
the
pears
you
welcome
to
them
i
sure
it
was
very
nice
of
her
said
belle
sweetly
peeling
the
juicy
fruit
slowly
with
her
penknife
as
they
turned
away
down
the
street
so
stupid
of
me
to
make
such
a
mistake
have
another
darling
they
quite
delicious
though
they
are
so
small
isobel
walked
along
rather
silent
and
preoccupied
though
she
would
not
allow
it
to
herself
down
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
there
was
the
uncomfortable
suspicion
that
belle
had
known
all
the
time
and
had
meant
to
give
the
wrong
coin
she
thought
isobel
she
have
made
a
mistake
and
thought
she
really
had
a
penny
in
her
pocket
yet
at
the
level
crossing
she
certainly
said
the
halfpenny
was
all
she
had
until
she
got
her
weekly
money
perhaps
she
forgot
oh
dear
i
know
she
mean
to
cheat
or
tell
stories
i
sure
she
would
for
the
world
but
somehow
i
it
had
happened
chapter
vii
the
stormy
petrel
a
boat
a
boat
is
the
toy
for
me
to
rollick
about
in
on
river
and
sea
to
be
a
child
of
the
breeze
and
the
gale
and
like
a
wild
bird
on
the
deep
to
sail
this
is
the
life
for
me
the
united
sea
urchins
recreation
society
usually
met
every
morning
upon
the
strip
of
green
common
underneath
the
cliffs
which
they
had
appropriated
to
their
own
use
and
were
prepared
to
hold
against
all
comers
the
rokebys
who
were
enthusiastic
bathers
had
a
tent
upon
the
shore
and
spent
nearly
half
the
morning
in
the
sea
where
they
could
float
swim
on
their
backs
tread
water
and
even
turn
head
over
heels
much
to
the
envy
of
the
wrights
who
made
valiant
efforts
to
emulate
these
wonderful
feats
and
nearly
drowned
themselves
in
the
attempt
the
two
little
barringtons
were
solemnly
bathed
each
day
by
their
mother
in
a
roofless
tent
which
was
fixed
upon
four
poles
over
a
hole
previously
dug
in
the
sand
and
filled
by
the
advancing
tide
here
they
were
obliged
to
sit
for
ten
minutes
in
the
water
with
the
sun
pouring
down
upon
them
till
the
small
tent
resembled
a
vapour
bath
after
which
they
were
massaged
according
to
the
treatment
recommended
by
a
certain
heidelberg
doctor
in
whom
barrington
had
great
faith
and
whose
methods
she
insisted
upon
carrying
out
to
the
letter
in
spite
of
ruth
indignant
remonstrances
and
edna
wails
ruth
says
bathing
no
fun
at
all
confided
isobel
to
her
mother
and
i
should
think
it
is
if
you
ca
splash
about
in
the
sea
and
enjoy
yourself
barrington
wo
let
them
try
to
swim
and
they
just
have
to
sit
in
a
puddle
inside
the
tent
while
she
flings
cans
of
down
their
backs
edna
says
the
hot
sun
makes
the
skin
peel
off
her
and
she
ca
bear
the
rubbing
afterwards
her
clothes
fridge
her
too
they
always
wear
thick
woollen
even
in
this
blazing
weather
their
mother
so
afraid
of
them
taking
a
chill
poor
children
said
stewart
i
certainly
think
they
have
rather
a
bad
time
it
must
be
very
hard
to
be
brought
up
by
rule
and
to
have
so
many
experiments
tried
upon
you
ruth
says
she
has
one
comfort
though
continued
isobel
allowed
to
speak
english
all
the
time
during
the
holidays
at
home
they
have
a
german
governess
and
they
talk
french
one
day
and
german
the
next
and
english
only
on
sundays
ruth
hates
languages
she
wo
speak
a
word
to
mademoiselle
but
she
says
the
wrights
simply
talk
it
half
of
it
english
words
although
they
so
conceited
about
it
and
generally
say
something
out
very
loud
if
they
think
anybody
is
passing
even
if
it
only
fait
beau
or
vous
the
rokebys
poke
terrible
fun
at
them
they
made
up
a
gibberish
language
of
their
own
and
they
talk
it
hard
whenever
the
wrights
let
off
french
it
makes
charlotte
and
aggie
quite
savage
because
they
know
they
talking
about
them
only
they
understand
a
word
what
the
club
going
to
do
asked
bertie
rokeby
one
morning
looking
somewhat
damp
and
moist
after
his
swim
he
never
dry
himself
properly
said
rokeby
he
just
gets
into
his
clothes
as
he
is
and
he
sitting
down
on
the
old
boat
just
where
the
sun
has
melted
the
pitch
and
it
will
be
sure
to
stick
to
his
trousers
do
know
said
harold
wright
lolling
comfortably
in
the
shade
of
a
rock
with
his
head
on
his
jacket
too
hot
to
race
round
with
the
thermometer
over
i
shall
stay
where
i
am
with
a
book
get
up
you
fat
porpoise
you
grow
too
lazy
to
walk
unless
you
mean
to
stop
and
swat
at
greek
like
old
arthur
no

laughed
harold
i
not
in
for
a
scholarship

thank
goodness
i
just
going
to
kick
my
heels
here
the
far
you
know
let
us
go
down
to
the
quay
suggested
charlie
chester
and
watch
the
boats
come
in
it
stunning
to
see
them
packing
all
the
herrings
into
barrels
and
flinging
the
mackerel
about
some
of
the
men
are
ever
so
decent
they
let
you
help
to
haul
in
the
ropes
and
take
you
on
board
sometimes
shall
we
go
too
said
belle
who
with
her
arm
as
usual
round
waist
stood
among
the
group
of
children
it
rather
fun
down
by
the
quay
if
you
do
get
near
the
are
you
coming
aggie
yes
if
charlotte
and
mademoiselle
will
go
aller

le
mademoiselle
shivered
slightly
as
if
aggie
french
set
her
teeth
on
edge
que
chère
enfant
cette
markeet
she
replied
i
do
know
whether
i
can
quite
explain
it
in
french
replied
aggie
but
seeing
the
rokebys
come
up
she
made
a
desperate
effort
to
sustain
her
character
as
a
linguist
où
on
vend
le
poisson
vous
savez
unfortunately
she
pronounced
like
the
english
poison
and
mademoiselle
held
up
her
dainty
little
hands
with
a
shriek
of
horror
vere

said
arthur
taking
his

for
a
moment
out
of
his
dictionary
aggie
only
meant
the
let
the
kids
go
if

said
charlie
chester
cordially
venez
avec

that
about
all
the
french
i
can
talk
because
at
school
we
only
learn
to
write
exercises
about
pens
and
ink
and

and
the

and
lending

said
charlotte
wright
who
liked
to
keep
her
governess
to
herself
we
have
time
either
we
must
do
our
translation
before
dinner
and
joyce
and
eric

unless
there
to
look
after
them
all
right
do
then
we
sha
grieve
retorted
charlie
we
go
with
the
rokebys
but
the
rokebys
though
ready
as
a
rule
to
go
anywhere
and
everywhere
on
this
particular
occasion
were
due
at
the
railway
station
to
meet
a
cousin
who
was
arriving
that
morning
so
it
ended
in
only
belle
and
isobel
with
charlie
and
hilda
chester
setting
off
for
the
old
town
the
quay
was
a
busy
bustling
scene
the
had
just
come
in
and
it
was
quite
a
wonderful
sight
to
watch
the
fish
with
their
shining
iridescent
colours
leaping
by
hundreds
inside
the
holds
they
were
flung
out
upon
the
jetty
and
packed
at
once
into
barrels
an
operation
which
seemed
to
demand
much
noise
and
shouting
on
the
part
of
the
fishermen
in
the
boats
and
to
call
for
a
good
deal
of
forcible
language
from
their
partners
on
shore
the
small
fry
and
were
thrown
overboard
for
the
that
hovered
round
with
loud
cries
waiting
to
pounce
upon
the
tempting
morsels
while
the
great
flat
skate
and
were
put
aside
separately
they
stuff
you
see
explained
charlie
chester
who
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
most
gait
went
strolling
jauntily
up
and
down
the
harbour
inspecting
the
cargoes
trying
the
strength
of
the
cables
peeping
into
the
barrels
with
the
knowing
air
of
a
connoisseur
of
fish
and
generally
putting
himself
where
he
was
decidedly
not
wanted
they
only
pack
the
herrings
and
they
salt
and
dry
the
others
in
the
sun
you
can
see
them
dangling
outside
their
cottage
doors
all
over
the
town
and
smell
them
too
i
should
say
when
they
quite
hard
they
hammer
them
out
flat
and
send
them
to
whitechapel
for
the
jews
to
buy
at
least
that
what
the
mate
of
the
told
me
the
other
day
they
eat
them
themselves
too
said
hilda
i
went
inside
a
cottage
one
day
and
they
were
frying
some
for
dinner
the
woman
gave
me
a
taste
but
it
was
perfectly
horrid
and
i
could
swallow
it
i
had
to
rush
outside
round
the
corner
and
spit
it
out
you
disgusting
girl
said
belle
picking
her
way
daintily
between
the
barrels
i
wonder
you
could
touch
it
to
begin
with
why
here
are
the
women
coming
with
the
cockles
what
a
haul
they
had
there
old
biddy
at
the
head
of
them
so
she
is
cried
charlie
her
basket
looks
almost
bursting
hullo

dublin
fair
city
where
girls
are
so
pretty
there
once
lived
a
maiden
named
molly
malon
she
wheeled
a
wheelbarrow
through
streets
wide
and
narrow
singing
cockles
and
mussels
alive
change
it
into

and
there
you

for

charlie
laughed

and
me
turned
sixty
only
the
other
day
if

for
the
kreel
on
me
back
i
be
afther
yez
i
like
to
see
you
catch
me
cried
charlie
as
he
jumped
on
a
heap
of
barrels
bringing
the
whole
pile
with
a
crash
to
the
ground
greatly
to
the
wrath
of
the
owner
who
expressed
his
views
with
so
much
vigour
that
the
children
judged
it
discreet
to
adjourn
farther
on
along
the
quay
they
strolled
past
the
storehouse
and
round
the
corner
to
where
a
flight
of
green
slimy
steps
led
down
to
the
water
there
was
an
iron
ring
here
in
the
sea
wall
and
tied
to
it
by
a
short
cable
was
the
jolliest
pleasure
boat
imaginable
newly
painted
in
white
and
blue
with
her
name
the
stormy
in
gilt
letters
on
the
prow
her
sail
furled
and
a
pair
of
sculls
lying
ready
along
her
seats
she
a
smart
craft
said
charlie
reaching
down
to
the
painter
and
pulling
the
boat
up
to
the
steps
i
vote
we
get
inside
her
and
try
what
she
feels
like
will
they
let
us
asked
isobel
we
wo
ask
them
laughed
charlie
it
all
right
we
sha
do
any
harm
they
can
turn
us
out
if
they
want
her
come
along
and
he
held
out
his
hand
it
was
such
a
tempting
proposal
that
it
simply
was
not
in
human
nature
to
resist
and
the
three
little
girls
hopped
briskly
into
the
boat
belle
and
isobel
settling
themselves
in
the
bows
and
hilda
taking
a
seat
in
the
stern
it
almost
feels
as
if
we
were
really
sailing
said
isobel
as
the
boat
danced
upon
the
green
water
pulling
at
its
painter
as
though
it
were
anxious
to
break
away
and
follow
the
ebbing
tide
she
cut
through
anything
she
so
sharp
in
the
bows
said
charlie
handling
the
sculls
lovingly
and
looking
out
towards
the
mouth
of
the
harbour
where
long
waves
flecked
the
horizon
ca
you
take
us
for
a
row
charlie
cried
belle
it
so
jolly
on
the
water
yes
do
charlie
echoed
hilda
it
would
be
such
fun
do
you
mean
go
for
a
real
sail
asked
isobel
rather
aghast
at
such
a
daring
proposal
oh
we
only
take
her
for
a
turn
round
the
harbour
and
be
back
before
any
one
missed
her
it
would
be
an
awful
lark
said
charlie
but
not
without
a
boatman
remonstrated
isobel
why
not
i
know
all
about
sailing
replied
charlie
confidently
for
having
been
occasionally
taken
yachting
by
his
father
and
having
picked
up
a
number
of
nautical
terms
which
he
generally
used
wrongly
he
imagined
himself
to
be
a
thorough
jack
tar
would
you
like
it
i
thought
you
were
fond
of
the
sea
so
i
am
said
isobel
but
i
do
think
we
ought
to
go
without
asking
it
not
our
boat
and
the
man
she
belongs
to
might
like
us
to
take
her
out
by
ourselves
i
suppose
you
afraid
sneered
charlie
most
girls
are
dreadful
hilda
keen
enough
and
as
for
belle
she
half
wild
to
go
i
can
see
i
should
think
i
am
and
what
more
i
mean
to
declared
belle
and
settling
the
dispute
as
alexander
of
old
untied
the
gordian
knot
she
took
her
penknife
from
her
pocket
and
leaning
over
cut
the
painter
off
sharp
you
done
it
cried
charlie
well
we
off
at
any
rate
so
we
may
as
well
enjoy
hilda
you
must
steer
while
i
row
if
you
watch
me
feather
my
oars
you
see
i
can
manage
the
thing
in
ripping
style
there
was
such
a
strong
ebb
tide
that
charlie
had
really
no
need
to
row
the
boat
went
skimming
over
the
waves
as
if
she
had
been
a
veritable
stormy
petrel
sending
the
water
churning
round
her
bows
although
all
four
children
felt
a
trifle
guilty
they
could
not
help
enjoying
the
delightful
sensation
of
that
motion
over
the
sea
nearly
all
have
a
love
for
the
water
perhaps
some
spirit
of
the
old
vikings
still
lingers
in
our
blood
and
thrills
afresh
at
the
splash
of
the
waves
the
dash
of
the
salt
spray
and
the
fleck
of
the
foam
on
our
faces
there
is
a
feeling
of
freedom
a
sense
of
air
and
space
and
dancing
light
and
soft
subdued
sound
that
blend
into
one
exhilarating
joy
when
with
only
a
plank
between
us
and
the
racing
water
it
is
as
if
nature
took
us
in
her
arms
and
were
about
to
carry
us
away
from
every
trammel
of
civilization
somewhere
into
that
land
that
lies
always
just
over
the
horizon
that
lost
atlantis
which
the
old
navigators
sought
so
carefully
but
never
found
isobel
sat
in
the
bows
her
hand
locked
in
belle
she
felt
as
if
they
were
birds
flying
through
space
together
or
mermaids
who
had
risen
up
from
the
palace
to
take
a
look
at
the
above
and
were
floating
along
as
much
a
part
of
the
waves
as
the
great
trails
of
or
the
lumps
of
soft
spongy
foam
that
whirled
by
them
charlie
rested
on
his
sculls
and
let
the
boat
take
her
course
for
a
while
she
was
heading
towards
the
bar
straight
out
from
the
cliffs
and
the
harbour
to
where
the
heavy
breakers
which
dashed
against
the
lighthouse
merged
into
the
rollers
of
the
open
sea
are
we
going
out
rather
a
long
way
said
belle
at
last
passed
the
old
schooner
and
the
dredger
and
we
very
nearly
at
the
buoy
we
do
want
to
sail
quite
to
america
though
it
jolly
when
we
skim
along
like
this
if
we
do
mind
we
shall
be
over
the
bar
in
a
few
minutes
by
jove
so
we
shall
cried
charlie
i
did
notice
we
come
so
far
we
must
bring
her
get
her
athwart
hilda
quick
i
suppose
if
you
pull
one
line
it
goes
one
way
and
if
you
pull
the
other
line
it
goes
the
other
way
said
hilda
whose
first
experience
it
was
with
the
tiller
giving
such
a
mighty
jerk
as
an
experiment
that
she
swung
the
boat
half
round
easy
abaft
shouted
charlie
do
you
want
to
capsize
us
turn
her
to
starboard
she
on
the
port
tack
put
up
the
helm
and
make
her
luff
what
you
mean
cried
hilda
utterly
bewildered
by
these
nautical
directions
you
little
idiot
do
tug
so
hard
you
be
running
us
into
the
buoy
look
here
you
ca
steer
just
drop
these
lines
i
better
ship
the
oars
and
hoist
the
sail
and
then
i
can
take
the
tiller
myself
there
a
stiffish
breeze
i
can
tack
her
round
you
see
if
i
no
one
interfering
now
let
me
get
my
bearings
are
you
sure
you
know
how
asked
belle
uneasily
have
i
watched
old
jordan
do
it
a
hundred
times
declared
charlie
i
soon
have
the
canvas
up
i
say
look
out
there
the
blooming
thing
heavier
than
i
thought
oh
do
be
careful
entreated
belle
as
the
sail
went
up
in
a
very
peculiar
fashion
and
beginning
to
fill
with
the
breeze
sent
the
boat
heeling
sharply
over
she
be
perfectly
right
if
i
slack
out
the
wind
on
our
beam
replied
charlie
i
must
get
her
you
going
to
upset
us
exclaimed
belle
for
the
sail
was
flapping
about
in
such
a
wild
and
unsteady
manner
as
seemed
to
threaten
to
overturn
the
little
vessel
not
if
i
make
this
taut
cried
charlie
hauling
away
with
all
his
hilda
that
was
a
near
shave
as
the
unmanageable
canvas
swelling
out
suddenly
caught
her
a
blow
on
the
side
of
her
head
and
nearly
swept
her
from
the
boat
hilda
gave
a
shriek
of
terror
and
clung
wildly
to
the
gunwale
o
charlie
she
cried
take
us
back
i
do
like
sailing
i
want
to
go
home
oh
why
did
we
ever
come
shrieked
belle
jumping
up
in
her
seat
and
wringing
her
hands
you
send
us
to
the
bottom
sit
still
dear
cried
isobel
you
upset
the
boat
if
you
move
so
charlie
i
think
you
better
take
down
that
sail
and
try
the
sculls
again
if
you
let
me
steer
perhaps
i
could
manage
better
than
hilda
and
we
could
turn
out
of
the
current
it
taking
us
straight
to
sea
if
we
can
head
round
towards
the
quay
we
might
get
back
all
serene
said
charlie
furling
his
canvas
with
secret
relief
there
ought
to
be
several
really
for
this
job
it
takes
more
than
one
to
sail
a
craft
properly
and
none
of
you
girls
know
how
to
help
he
gave
isobel
a
hand
as
she
moved
cautiously
into
the
stern
and
settling
her
with
the
ropes
he
once
more
took
up
the
oars
i
shall
come
too
wailed
belle
i
ca
stay
alone
at
this
end
of
the
boat
isobel
it
horrid
of
you
to
leave
me
sit
still
commanded
charlie
it
you
who
have
us
over
if
you
jump
about
like
that
we
ca
all
be
at
one
end
i
tell
you
you
must
stop
where
you
are
he
made
a
desperate
effort
to
turn
the
boat
but
his
boyish
arms
were
powerless
against
the
strength
of
the
ebbing
tide
and
they
were
swept
rapidly
towards
the
bar
it
no
use
said
charlie
at
last
shipping
his
sculls
i
ca
get
her
out
of
this
current
we
shall
just
have
to
drift
on
till
some
one
sees
us
and
picks
us
up
o
charlie
cried
hilda
her
round
chubby
face
aghast
with
horror
shall
we
float
on
for
days
and
days
without
anything
to
eat
or
be
shipwrecked
on
a
desert
island
like
robinson
crusoe
and
have
to
cling
to
broken
masts
and
spars
we
all
right
do
make
such
a
fuss
said
charlie
glancing
uneasily
however
at
the
long
waves
ahead
they
were
crossing
the
bar
and
the
water
was
rough
outside
the
harbour
i
we
going
to
be
drowned
moaned
belle
it
your
fault
charlie
you
ought
never
to
have
brought
us
well
i
like
that
retorted
charlie
with
some
heat
when
it
was
you
who
first
thought
of
it
and
asked
me
to
take
you
i
suppose
you
be
saying
i
cut
the
painter
next
you
want
to
throw
the
blame
on
me
declared
belle
no
i
do
but
there
such
a
thing
as
fair
play
o
charlie
it
does
matter
whose
fault
it
was
now
said
isobel
i
suppose
in
a
way
it
all
our
faults
for
getting
in
to
begin
with
could
we
somehow
raise
a
signal
of
distress
suppose
you
tie
my
handkerchief
to
the
scull
and
hoist
it
up
like
a
flag
some
ship
might
notice
it
not
a
bad
idea
said
charlie
who
by
this
time
wished
himself
well
out
of
the
scrape
you
a
head
on
your
shoulders
though
i
did
call
you
a
between
them
they
managed
to
tie
on
the
handkerchief
and
hoist
the
oar
and
as
their
improvised
flag
fluttered
in
the
wind
they
hoped
desperately
that
it
might
bring
some
friendly
vessel
to
their
aid
they
had
quite
cleared
the
harbour
by
now
the
sea
was
rough
and
the
current
still
carried
them
on
fast
isobel
sat
with
her
arm
round
poor
little
hilda
who
clung
to
her
very
closely
watching
the
water
with
a
white
frightened
face
though
she
was
too
plucky
to
cry
belle
who
had
completely
lost
was
huddled
down
in
the
bows
shaking
with
hysterical
sobs
and
uttering
shrieks
every
time
the
boat
struck
a
bigger
wave
than
usual
i
wonder
no
one
in
the
harbour
noticed
us
set
off
said
isobel
after
a
time
when
the
land
seemed
to
be
growing
more
and
more
distant
behind
them
they
were
busy
packing
the
herrings
replied
charlie
and
you
see
we
started
from
round
the
corner
our
only
chance
now
is
meeting
some
boat
coming
from
ferndale
i
say
do
you
think
that
a
sail
over
there
it
is
cried
isobel
let
us
hold
the
flag
up
higher
and
we
call
as
loud
as
we
can
sound
carries
so
far
over
water
perhaps
they
might
hear
us
ahoy
there
yelled
charlie
with
the
full
strength
of
his
lungs
boat
ahoy
and
hilda
and
isobel
joining
in
they
contrived
amongst
them
to
raise
a
considerably
lusty
shout
to
their
intense
relief
it
seemed
to
be
heard
as
the
ship
tacked
round
and
bearing
down
upon
them
very
soon
came
up
alongside
well
of
all
sights
as
ever
i
clapped
eyes
on
four
bairns
adrift
in
an
open
craft
i
thought
summat
was
up
when
i
see
your
flag
and
then
you
easy
there
jim
take
the
little
on
first
mind
that
lad
he
be
overboard
whisht
honey
do
take
on
so
you
soon
be
safe
back
with
your
now
missy
give
me
your
hand
ay
you
been
up
to
some
fine
games
here
i
wager
as
you
never
did
ought
but
there
bairns
will
be
bairns
and
i
should
know
for
i
reared
seven
mr
binks
cried
isobel
to
whom
the
ruddy
cheeks
the
bushy
eyebrows
and
the
conversational
voice
of
her
friend
of
the
railway
train
were
quite
unmistakable
why
it
little
missy
as
were
comin
to
silversands
responded
the
old
man
to
think
as
i
should
met
you
again
like
this
i
felt
as
if
somethin
sent
me
out
this
mornin
over
and
above
callin
at
ferndale
for
a
load
of
coals
which
would
done
just
as
well
the
workin
of
providence
as
we
come
on
this
tack
or
you
might
been
right
out
to
sea
and
ten
to
one
upset
in
that
narrer
bit
of
a
boat
it
certainly
felt
far
safer
in
binks
though
they
had
to
sit
amongst
the
coals
and
submit
to
be
rather
searchingly
and
embarrassingly
catechised
as
to
how
they
came
to
be
in
such
a
perilous
situation
their
plight
had
been
noticed
at
last
from
the
harbour
where
the
owner
of
the
boat
missing
his
craft
had
raised
a
and
there
was
quite
a
little
crowd
gathered
to
meet
them
on
the
jetty
when
they
landed
a
crowd
which
expressed
its
satisfaction
at
their
timely
rescue
or
its
disapproval
of
their
escapade
according
to
individual
temperament
praise
the
saints
ye
not
drownded
entoirely
cried
biddy
giving
charlie
a
smacking
kiss
much
to
his
disgust
and
it
ould
biddy
mulligan
as
saw
the
peril
ye
was
in
and
asked
pathrick
and
the
blessed
virgin
to
keep
an
eye
on
yez
holy
bridget
but
ye
a
broth
of
a
boy
afther
all
i
main
set
to
give
you
a
jolly
good
hidin
growled
the
owner
of
the
boat
greeting
charlie
with
a
somewhat
different
reception
and
fingering
a
piece
of
as
if
he
were
much
tempted
to
put
his
threat
into
execution
do
you
never
let
me
catch
you
on
this
quay
again
meddlin
with
other
folk
property
if
you
want
to
keep
your
skin
on
you
he
really
was
most
dreadfully
angry
isobel
told
her
mother
in
the
graphic
account
which
she
gave
afterwards
of
the
adventure
but
charlie
said
how
very
sorry
we
were
he
took
the
whole
blame
to
himself
though
it
was
all
his
fault
by
any
means
and
he
offered
to
pay
for
having
borrowed
the
boat
then
the
man
said
he
spoke
up
like
a
gentleman
and
he
would
take
his
money
from
him
and
binks
said
bairns
would
be
bairns
and
it
was
a
mercy
we
had
gone
to
the
bottom
and
the
man
shook
hands
with
charlie
and
said
he
was
a
plucky
little
chap
with
a
good
notion
of
handling
a
sail
and
he
take
him
out
some
time
and
show
him
how
to
do
it
properly
and
binks
said
i
never
been
to
see
him
yet
and
i
told
him
you
sprained
your
ankle
and
could
walk
but
it
was
getting
better
nicely
and
you
soon
be
able
to
and
he
said
would
we
write
and
give
him
warning
when
we
made
up
our
minds
and
his
missis
should
bake
a
cranberry
cake
on
purpose
and
if
we
came
early
he
row
us
over
to
see
the
balk
i
said
we
should
be
very
pleased
because
you
promised
before
that
you
go
so
you
will
wo
you
mother
i
shall
be
only
too
glad
to
have
an
opportunity
of
thanking
him
said
stewart
i
feel
i
owe
him
a
big
debt
of
gratitude
perhaps
in
the
meantime
we
can
think
of
some
pretty
little
present
to
take
with
us
that
would
please
him
and
his
wife
as
a
slight
return
for
his
kindness
you
would
have
time
to
embroider
a
if
i
were
to
help
you
that
would
be
lovely
said
isobel
and
then
they
could
use
it
every
day
at
we
could
work
a
teapot
on
one
side
and
a
big
on
the
other
for
binks
i
sure
they
like
that
may
i
go
and
buy
the
materials
this
afternoon
i
brought
my
thimble
with
me
and
my
new
scissors
in
the
green
silk
bag
i
feel
as
if
i
should
like
to
begin
and
make
it
at
once
chapter
viii
though
a
truth
to
outward
seeming
yet
a
truth
it
may
not
prove
although
stewart
had
now
been
more
than
ten
days
at
silversands
she
had
not
yet
received
any
reply
to
the
letter
which
she
had
dispatched
with
so
many
on
the
evening
of
her
arrival
does
he
mean
to
ignore
it
altogether
she
asked
herself
will
he
never
forgive
can
he
allow
his
grandchild
the
only
kith
and
kin
that
is
left
to
him
to
be
within
a
few
miles
and
not
wish
at
least
to
see
her
does
he
still
think
me
the
scheming
adventuress
that
he
called
me
in
the
first
heat
of
his
anger
and
imagine
i
am
plotting
to
get
hold
of
his
money
i
would
not
touch
one
penny
of
it
for
myself
but
i
think
it
is
only
right
and
fair
that
isobel
should
be
sent
to
a
really
good
school
it
would
be
such
a
small
expense
to
him
out
of
his
large
income
and
it
is
simply
impossible
for
me
to
manage
it
i
have
done
my
best
for
her
so
far
but
she
is
so
quick
and
bright
that
she
will
very
soon
be
growing
beyond
my
teaching
he
will
surely
realize
that
for
the
credit
of
his
own
name
something
ought
to
be
done
perhaps
he
may
be
ill
or
away
and
has
not
been
able
to
attend
to
my
letter
i
must
have
patience
for
a
little
longer
and
wait
and
see
whether
he
will
not
send
me
an
answer
the
waiting
seemed
very
long
and
tedious
to
poor
stewart
as
she
lay
through
those
hot
summer
days
on
the
hard
horsehair
sofa
of
the
small
back
at
no
marine
terrace
as
the
lonely
hours
passed
away
the
lines
of
trouble
deepened
in
her
forehead
and
she
stitched
so
many
cares
into
the
winter
she
was
beguiling
the
time
by
making
that
every
gusset
and
hem
seemed
a
reminder
of
some
anxious
thought
for
the
future
in
the
meantime
isobel
remained
sublimely
unconscious
of
her
hopes
and
fears
to
her
the
visit
to
silversands
was
nothing
but
the
most
glorious
holiday
she
had
spent
in
her
life
and
her
jolly
times
with
the
sea
urchins
and
especially
the
delight
of
her
friendship
with
belle
made
the
days
fly
only
too
fast
the
latter
was
still
as
clinging
and
affectionate
as
ever
and
would
scarcely
allow
isobel
out
of
her
sight
i
rather
be
with
you
darling
than
with
any
one
else
she
declared
enthusiastically
i
used
to
think
i
liked
winnie
rokeby
but
she
was
very
unkind
once
or
twice
and
told
such
nasty
tales
about
me
actually
trying
to
make
out
i
was
selfish
just
because
i
wanted
her
to
do
one
or
two
little
things
for
me
that
do
mind
doing
in
the
least
she
splashed
all
over
my
best
white
silk
dress
too
and
i
sure
it
was
on
purpose
and
she
said
my
hair
looked
exactly
like
sticks
of
and
belle
tossed
back
her
curls
as
if
indignant
yet
at
the
remembrance
she
really
fond
of
me
said
isobel
to
her
mother
and
it
so
nice
of
her
because
you
see
although
she
does
care
for
winnie
rokeby
she
might
have
had
aggie
wright
or
ruth
barrington
for
her
special
friend
she
knows
them
both
at
home
and
goes
to
all
their
parties
charlotte
wright
says
it
too
hot
to
last
but
that
just
because
aggie
was
jealous
that
belle
did
ask
her
to
go
to
tea
the
day
i
went
and
letty
rokeby
says
we
bound
to
have
a
quarrel
sooner
or
later
but
i
sure
we
sha
for
there
never
seems
anything
to
quarrel
about
and
i
could
imagine
being
out
of
friends
with
belle
on
the
afternoon
following
isobel
adventure
in
the
any
one
seated
in
the
front
windows
of
marine
terrace
might
have
been
interested
in
the
movements
of
an
elderly
gentleman
who
for
the
last
ten
minutes
had
been
slowly
pacing
up
and
down
the
broad
gravel
path
in
front
he
was
a
very
stately
old
gentleman
with
hair
and
a
long
drooping
moustache
he
held
himself
erect
too
as
if
he
were
at
parade
and
he
had
that
air
of
quiet
dignity
and
command
which
is
habitual
to
those
who
are
accustomed
to
seeing
their
orders
promptly
obeyed
whether
he
was
merely
enjoying
the
fresh
air
and
scenery
or
whether
he
was
waiting
for
somebody
it
was
difficult
to
tell
since
he
now
lighted
a
cigar
in
a
leisurely
fashion
and
cast
an
anxious
quick
look
towards
the
houses
and
frowning
slightly
would
walk
away
then
come
back
again
as
if
he
were
drawn
by
some
magnet
towards
the
spot
and
must
return
there
even
against
his
will
he
was
just
passing
the
garden
of
no
when
the
front
door
opened
and
belle
who
had
been
spending
an
hour
with
isobel
sauntered
down
the
path
and
closing
the
gate
behind
her
seated
herself
upon
one
of
the
benches
which
the
town
council
had
put
up
that
summer
on
the
gravel
walk
in
front
of
marine
terrace
as
a
kind
of
earnest
of
the
promenade
which
they
hoped
might
follow
in
course
of
time
she
spread
out
her
pretty
pink
muslin
dress
carefully
upon
the
seat
rearranged
her
hat
to
her
satisfaction
and
slowly
fastened
the
buttons
of
her
long
kid
gloves
it
was
too
early
to
go
home
yet
she
thought
for
her
mother
was
out
with
friends
and
their
was
not
until
five
so
she
sat
watching
the
sea
and
the
and
drawing
elaborate
circles
with
her
parasol
in
the
gravel
at
her
feet
she
was
quite
unaware
that
she
was
being
very
keenly
observed
by
the
old
gentleman
who
having
followed
her
walked
past
once
or
twice
with
an
undecided
air
and
finally
settled
himself
upon
the
opposite
end
of
the
bench
where
she
was
sitting
that
certainly
the
address
she
gave
me
he
muttered
to
himself
and
it
might
possibly
be
the
child
she
tallies
a
little
with
the
description
she
fair
and
not
though
i
do
see
a
trace
of
the
stewarts
in
her
face
as
for
resembling
my
isobel
well
of
course
that
was
only
a
scheme
on
the
mother
part
to
try
and
arouse
my
interest
in
her
what
the
letter
said
is
true
enough
all
the
same
if
she
my
grandchild
it
is
right
that
she
should
be
brought
up
in
penury
and
i
suppose
i
must
send
her
to
school
or
provide
in
some
way
for
her
i
ca
say
i
much
taken
with
her
looks
she
too
for
my
taste
where
did
her
mother
find
the
money
to
buy
those
it
does
accord
with
the
lack
of
means
she
complained
of
i
wonder
if
i
could
manage
to
ask
her
name
without
giving
myself
away
he
took
a
newspaper
from
his
pocket
and
spreading
it
out
pretended
to
read
stealing
occasional
glances
in
belle
direction
and
racking
his
brains
for
a
suitable
method
of
opening
a
conversation
belle
who
was
beginning
to
be
rather
tired
of
her
occupation
and
was
half
thinking
of
moving
farther
on
or
going
home
became
suddenly
conscious
that
she
seemed
to
be
arousing
an
unusual
degree
of
interest
in
her
companion
at
the
other
end
of
the
bench
constantly
petted
and
admired
by
her
mother
friends
she
was
accustomed
to
receive
a
good
deal
of
attention
and
it
struck
her
that
a
short
chat
with
this
stranger
might
beguile
her
monotony
until
she
therefore
let
her
fluffy
curls
fall
round
her
face
in
the
way
that
an
artist
had
once
painted
them
and
began
to
cast
coy
looks
from
under
her
long
lashes
in
his
direction
hoping
that
he
might
speak
to
her
both
of
which
methods
she
usually
found
very
engaging
with
elderly
gentlemen
who
generally
asked
her
whose
little
girl
she
was
and
ended
by
saying
she
was
a
charming
child
and
they
wished
they
owned
her
or
some
other
remark
equally
flattering
and
gratifying
in
this
case
however
her
pretty
ways
did
not
seem
to
have
their
due
effect
either
the
old
gentleman
was
really
shy
himself
or
he
found
a
difficulty
in
starting
for
though
he
cleared
his
throat
several
times
as
if
he
were
on
the
very
point
of
speaking
he
seemed
to
change
his
mind
and
kept
silence
somewhat
disappointed
belle
nevertheless
was
not
easily
baffled
and
after
having
sighed
coughed
opened
and
shut
her
parasol
taken
off
her
gloves
and
put
them
on
again
thereby
exhibiting
the
small
turquoise
ring
that
was
her
greatest
delight
and
finally
even
got
up
a
sneeze
all
without
any
result
she
at
last
pulled
off
her
bracelet
and
in
refastening
it
managed
with
considerable
skill
to
let
it
drop
on
the
ground
and
roll
almost
to
her
companion
feet
it
was
but
natural
that
he
should
pick
it
up
and
hand
it
to
her
oh
thank
you
so
much
exclaimed
belle
in
what
some
one
had
once
called
her
parisian
manner
it
was
so
careless
of
me
to
drop
it
and
i
would
have
lost
it
for
the
world
things
so
easily
roll
away
on
the
shore
do
they
i
suppose
they
do
replied
the
colonel
it
certainly
is
wise
to
send
your
trinkets
spinning
about
the
sands
i
value
that
one
too
said
belle
shaking
her
curls
because
you
see
it
was
a
present
a
friend
of
mother
gave
it
to
me
on
my
last
birthday
he
was
going
to
choose
a
book
at
first
he
always
sent
me
books
before
the
most
terrible
ones
shakespeare
and
lamb
and
ruskin
and
stupid
things
like
that
which
i
sha
ever
care
to
read
even
when
i
grown
up
so
this
birthday
i
asked
him
if
he
would
give
me
something
really
nice
and
he
laughed
and
brought
me
this
dear
little
bangle
and
said
he
expected
it
would
suit
miss
better
than
solid
reading
ugh
grunted
her
new
acquaintance
with
so
ambiguous
an
expression
that
belle
could
not
make
out
whether
he
sympathized
or
not
but
as
he
put
down
his
paper
and
seemed
quite
ready
to
listen
to
her
she
went
on
it
very
nice
at
silversands
mother
and
i
have
been
here
nearly
a
fortnight
we
think
the
air
bracing
and
the
lodgings
are
really
not
bad
for
a
little
place
like
this
one
does
expect
a
hotel
are
you
staying
in
marine
terrace
yes
it
the
nicest
part
because
you
get
the
view
of
the
sea
i
like
the
rooms
near
the
station
at
all
mother
looked
at
some
of
them
first
but
there
were
such
dreadfully
vulgar
children
stopping
there
wo
do
belle
she
said
could
have
you
in
the
same
house
with
people
of
that
sort
is
your
name
belle
yes
isabelle
stuart
but
it
generally
shortened
to
belle
mother
says
a
pet
name
somehow
seems
to
suit
me
better
last
winter
i
went
to
a
party
dressed
all
in
blue
and
everybody
called
me
bluebell
and
asked
if
i
came
from
fairyland
she
paused
here
thinking
the
old
gentleman
might
take
the
opportunity
to
put
in
a
compliment
but
he
did
not
rise
to
the
occasion
so
she
continued
other
people
asked
if
i
were
one
of
the
bluebells
of
scotland
but
we
not
scotch
although
our
name
stuart
my
father
was
english
i
ca
remember
him
properly
i
was
so
little
when
he
died
but
mother
always
says
i
his
very
image
rubbish
growled
the
colonel
suddenly
why
exclaimed
belle
in
astonishment
how
can
you
tell
you
know
him
he
was
very
tall
and
fair
mother
says
and
handsome
she
cries
when
i
talk
about
him
so
i
do
like
to
speak
of
him
very
often
what
is
she
doing
for
you
in
the
way
of
lessons
is
it
all
parties
and
trinkets
or
do
you
ever
do
anything
useful
asked
her
companion
of
course
i
have
lessons
replied
belle
with
dignity
feeling
rather
hurt
at
his
tone
i
learn
french
and
drawing
and
music
and
dancing
and
a
great
many
other
things
and
which
do
you
like
best
i
do
know
i
not
very
fond
of
history
or
geography
but
mother
hopes
i
get
on
with
music
it
so
useful
to
be
able
to
play
well
you
see
when
one
comes
out
i
think
i
like
the
dancing
lessons
most
we
learn
such
delightful
fancy
steps
some
of
us
did
a
skirt
dance
at
the
cavalry
bazaar
last
winter
and
i
was
the
queen
of
the
butterflies
i
had
a
white
dress
lined
with
yellow
and
turquoise
and
i
shook
it
out
like
this
when
i
danced
to
show
the
colours
people
clapped
ever
so
much
and
it
was
such
a
success
we
had
to
do
it
over
again
in
aid
of
the
hospital
our
mistress
wants
to
get
up
a
flower
dance
for
the
exhibition
next
winter
and
she
promised
i
should
be
the
rose
queen
but
mother
says
perhaps
i
may
go
to
school
before
then
time
you
did
too
high
time
and
to
a
school
where
they
put
something
in
the
girls
heads
remarked
the
colonel
almost
as
if
he
were
thinking
aloud
it
ought
to
be
history
and
geography
instead
of
bluebells
and
rose
queens
i
do
approve
of
capering
about
on
a
stage
in
fancy
dress
belle
was
much
offended
the
conversation
had
not
turned
out
nearly
so
interesting
as
she
expected
instead
of
being
appreciated
she
had
an
uneasy
sensation
that
the
old
gentleman
was
making
fun
of
her
and
as
this
was
not
at
all
to
her
taste
she
thought
it
time
to
beat
a
retreat
so
noticing
the
wrights
approaching
in
the
distance
she
rose
and
put
up
her
parasol
i
see
some
of
my
friends
she
said
in
what
she
hoped
was
rather
a
chilling
manner
and
i
must
go
and
speak
to
them
and
to
show
her
displeasure
she
marched
off
without
deigning
even
to
say
colonel
stewart
sat
watching
her
as
she
walked
away
with
a
somewhat
peculiar
expression
on
his
face
worse
than
i
could
ever
have
imagined
he
groaned
vain
shallow
and
caring
for
nothing
but
pleasure
and
showing
herself
off
in
public
places
decked
out
like
a
ballet
dancer
she
pretty
enough
in
a
superficial
kind
of
way
the
sort
of
beauty
you
get
in
a
doll
with
neither
mind
nor
soul
behind
it
worthy
of
the
name
indeed
oh
my
poor
boy
is
this
the
child
on
whom
you
had
set
such
high
hopes
and
is
this
little
french
really
and
truly
the
last
of
the
stewarts
chapter
ix
silversands
tower
say
what
deeds
of
ancient
valour
do
thy
ruined
walls
recall
four
on
the
next
afternoon
found
belle
tapping
at
the
door
of
the
little
back
in
no
with
a
very
important
face
why
what
the
matter
she
exclaimed
as
she
entered
in
response
to
stewart
come
in
for
isobel
was
sitting
in
the
big
armchair
propped
up
with
cushions
looking
as
limp
as
a
rag
and
as
white
as
a
small
ghost
it
only
one
of
her
bad
headaches
replied
stewart
i
think
it
must
be
the
heat
she
ought
not
to
have
played
cricket
this
morning
in
the
blazing
no
isobel
you
must
try
to
get
up
belle
may
sit
here
and
talk
to
you
for
a
few
minutes
but
i
afraid
i
ca
ask
her
to
stay
long
i
sorry
said
belle
sitting
down
on
the
arm
of
the
big
chair
and
squeezing
her
friend
hand
i
brought
an
invitation
mother
birthday
on
saturday
and
she
going
to
give
a
picnic
at
silversands
tower
and
ask
all
the
sea
urchins
wo
it
be
splendid
fun
you
simply
be
better
by
then
it
will
be
quite
a
large
party
chester
and
a
good
many
other
people
are
mother
wonders
if
your
foot
will
be
well
enough
stewart
she
would
be
so
pleased
to
see
you
if
you
do
mind
so
many
children
thank
you
dear
but
i
can
scarcely
manage
to
hobble
on
to
the
beach
at
present
replied
stewart
so
i
fear
it
is
out
of
the
question
for
me
much
as
i
should
have
enjoyed
it
isobel
of
course
will
be
only
too
delighted
to
accept
i
believe
the
very
thought
of
it
is
chasing
away
her
headache
we
to
drive
there
on
two
coaches
said
belle
and
have
tea
in
the
ruins
and
afterwards
we
can
play
games
or
ramble
about
in
the
woods
there
be
twelve
people
and
twenty
children
we
did
invite
the
wrights
baby
because
mother
said
it
was
too
young
and
she
really
could
stand
it
she
asked
all
the
rokebys
even
cecil
though
he
rather
a
handful
sometimes
but
rokeby
coming
i
expect
and
he
keep
him
in
order
the
wrights
are
bringing
an
aunt
who
just
arrived
back
from
a
visit
to
paris
i
afraid
we
shall
scarcely
get
them
to
talk
english
and
barrington
has
decided
yet
whether
she
let
ruth
and
edna
go
she
says
it
depends
upon
how
they
do
their
health
exercises
but
they
going
to
try
and
get
their
father
to
persuade
her
well
i
must
stay
now
if
your
head
aches
but
i
very
glad
you
can
come
i
think
we
shall
have
a
glorious
time
and
i
hope
saturday
will
be
fine
not
one
of
the
numerous
members
of
the
sea
urchins
club
could
have
been
more
anxious
for
a
brilliant
day
than
isobel
she
tapped
the
glass
in
the
hall
with
much
solicitude
and
even
paid
a
visit
to
her
friend
the
coastguard
to
inquire
his
opinion
as
to
the
state
of
the
weather
and
having
carefully
examined
a
threatening
bank
of
clouds
through
his
telescope
and
ascertained
that
the
objectionable
little
sailor
was
peeping
from
his
barometer
she
came
home
in
rather
low
spirits
in
spite
of
his
assurances
that
if
it
did
splash
a
bit
it
would
be
nowt
luckily
her
fears
proved
groundless
saturday
turned
out
everything
that
could
be
desired
in
the
way
of
sun
and
breeze
and
two
found
a
very
excited
group
of
children
gathered
outside
marine
terrace
where
two
yellow
coaches
hired
specially
from
ferndale
for
the
occasion
were
in
waiting
to
drive
the
party
to
the
tower
barton
stuart
maid
was
busy
packing
the
insides
with
baskets
of
and
hampers
of
provisions
and
some
of
the
smaller
boys
had
already
climbed
to
the
top
with
a
view
of
securing
the
whence
they
were
speedily
evicted
by
the
younger
guard
who
had
his
own
notions
about
reserving
the
best
places
and
who
having
already
had
a
scuffle
with
arnold
rokeby
on
the
subject
of
the
unauthorized
blowing
of
his
horn
was
disposed
to
resent
undue
interference
with
his
privileges
there
were
quite
enough
older
people
to
keep
the
children
in
order
which
seemed
a
fortunate
thing
to
judge
from
the
effervescing
nature
of
their
spirits
stuart
had
invited
several
of
her
friends
among
the
number
an
athletic
young
curate
named
browne
who
tucked
both
arnold
and
bertie
rokeby
easily
under
one
arm
and
held
them
there
as
in
a
vice
while
he
dangled
charlie
chester
in
with
the
other
hand
a
feat
of
prowess
which
so
excited
their
admiration
that
they
clung
to
him
like
burrs
for
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
the
wrights
had
turned
up
in
full
force
with
the
aunt
and
mademoiselle
and
were
commenting
upon
the
horses
and
the
general
arrangements
in
their
best
while
even
the
little
barringtons
had
been
allowed
after
all
to
join
the
fun
though
at
the
last
moment
much
to
ruth
disgust
their
mother
had
decided
to
accompany
them
to
see
that
they
did
not
race
about
in
the
sun
or
eat
indigestible
delicacies
it
took
a
long
time
to
settle
all
the
guests
in
their
seats
and
to
stow
away
the
lively
members
of
the
party
where
they
could
not
get
into
mischief
yet
would
not
interfere
with
the
comfort
of
their
more
elders
was
as
difficult
a
problem
as
the
puzzle
of
the
fox
the
goose
and
the
bag
of
corn
but
eventually
things
were
arranged
to
everybody
satisfaction
bertie
rokeby
who
had
announced
his
intention
of
taking
the
journey
hanging
on
to
the
leather
strap
at
the
back
beside
the
guard
was
safely
wedged
between
his
mother
and
the
jovial
curate
while
charlie
chester
had
been
allowed
to
screw
into
a
spare
six
inches
of
next
to
the
driver
who
held
out
a
that
he
might
hold
the
reins
going
uphill
the
whole
company
seemed
in
the
gayest
of
spirits
and
the
most
sociable
of
moods
chester
who
was
something
of
a
wag
kept
both
coaches
in
a
roar
with
his
jokes
and
a
young
lady
in
who
had
looked
rather
unapproachable
at
first
proved
to
have
her
pockets
overflowing
with
chocolates
which
she
distributed
with
a
liberal
hand
and
was
voted
by
the
boys
in
consequence
a
regular
the
last
comers
being
at
length
seated
and
the
last
forgotten
basket
put
inside
the
guards
blew
their
horns
the
drivers
whipped
up
and
the
two
coaches
set
off
with
a
dash
to
the
admiration
of
all
the
visitors
in
marine
terrace
and
the
rejoicing
of
a
small
crowd
of
barefooted
boys
from
the
town
who
had
assembled
to
watch
the
start
and
who
ran
diligently
for
nearly
half
a
mile
behind
them
shouting
a
give
us
a
with
irritating
monotony
and
eluding
the
skilful
lashes
of
the
coachmen
long
whips
with
considerable
agility
it
was
not
a
very
great
distance
to
the
tower
and
the
children
thought
the
drive
far
too
short
and
were
quite
loath
indeed
to
come
down
when
the
horses
stopped
before
the
gray
old
gateway
and
the
guards
who
had
been
rivalling
one
another
in
solos
on
the
horn
joined
in
a
farewell
duet
to
the
appropriate
air
of
meet
me
again
in
the
evening
the
ruined
castle
made
a
charming
spot
for
an
party
situated
at
the
foot
of
a
tall
wooded
hill
called
the
scar
its
battered
walls
faced
the
long
valley
to
the
north
up
which
in
the
olden
days
a
strict
watch
must
have
been
kept
for
border
raiders
the
ancient
turreted
keep
with
its
tiny
loophole
windows
was
still
standing
half
covered
with
ivy
the
hairy
stems
of
which
were
as
thick
as
small
trees
and
a
narrow
winding
staircase
led
on
to
the
battlements
from
whence
you
might
see
on
the
one
hand
the
green
slopes
of
the
woods
and
on
the
other
the
yellow
cliffs
which
bounded
the
blue
waters
of
the
bay
inside
the
keep
was
a
large
square
courtyard
where
in
times
gone
by
the
neighbouring
farmers
would
often
drive
their
cattle
for
safety
when
the
gleam
of
the
scottish
pikes
and
the
smoke
of
burning
roofs
were
seen
to
northward
the
heavy
portcullis
hung
yet
in
the
gateway
and
though
the
drawbridge
was
long
ago
gone
and
the
moat
was
dry
the
fragments
of
an
outer
wall
and
a
portion
of
a
barbican
remained
to
show
how
powerful
a
protection
was
needed
in
the
days
when
might
was
right
and
each
man
must
guard
his
goods
by
the
strength
of
his
own
hand
the
courtyard
now
was
covered
with
short
green
grass
spangled
with
daisies
where
a
pair
of
tame
ravens
were
solemnly
hopping
about
while
the
ivy
was
the
home
of
innumerable
jackdaws
that
flapped
away
at
the
approach
of
strangers
uttering
their
funny
spoilt
caw
as
if
indignant
at
having
their
haunts
disturbed
visitors
were
admitted
to
the
castle
by
an
old
woman
who
looked
almost
as
ancient
as
the
ruin
itself
and
who
insisted
upon
giving
a
full
account
of
the
dimensions
situation
and
history
of
the
place
which
she
had
learnt
from
the
and
which
she
repeated
in
a
high
voice
without
any
pauses
or
stops
as
if
she
were
saying
a
lesson
she
followed
the
various
members
of
the
party
for
some
time
trying
to
make
them
keep
together
and
listen
to
her
explanations
but
as
they
much
preferred
to
explore
on
their
own
account
she
was
obliged
to
subside
at
last
to
her
little
kitchen
under
the
archway
and
employ
herself
in
the
more
practical
business
of
boiling
the
water
for
tea
all
the
guests
were
very
soon
distributed
about
the
ruins
some
admiring
the
view
from
the
battlements
some
peering
into
the
darkness
of
the
dungeons
and
others
trying
to
the
guardroom
and
the
with
knights
and
dames
of
old
and
to
imagine
the
clink
of
armour
and
the
clash
of
swords
in
the
courtyard
below
the
rokeby
boys
were
imperilling
their
limbs
by
a
climb
after
jackdaws
nests
oblivious
of
the
fact
that
it
was
long
past
the
season
for
eggs
and
the
young
birds
already
in
glossy
black
plumage
were
flying
round
as
if
in
mockery
at
their
efforts
austin
wright
after
a
vain
attempt
to
establish
an
acquaintance
with
the
ravens
had
been
seen
racing
as
if
for
his
life
with
the
pair
in
hot
pursuit
of
his
small
bare
legs
while
charlie
chester
in
an
essay
to
investigate
the
interior
of
the
well
very
nearly
fell
to
the
bottom
being
only
saved
by
the
tail
of
his
jacket
which
luckily
caught
on
a
prickly
bramble
bush
and
held
him
suspended
over
the
dark
gulf
till
he
was
rescued
by
his
indignant
father
in
the
meantime
tea
had
been
spread
in
the
courtyard
two
great
hissing
urns
were
carried
from
the
kitchen
and
placed
upon
the
grass
and
both
and
children
abandoning
the
study
of
mediæval
history
or
the
pursuit
of
jackdaws
collected
together
to
discuss
sandwiches
cakes
and
jam
puffs
in
spite
of
chester
laughing
protestations
that
such
modern
luxuries
were
out
of
place
and
an
ox
roasted
whole
or
a
red
deer
pasty
would
have
been
a
more
appropriate
feast
for
the
occasion
even
the
ravens
came
hopping
round
at
the
sight
of
the
cups
and
plates
and
waxed
quite
friendly
on
the
strength
of
sundry
pieces
of
bun
and
bread
and
butter
which
they
snapped
up
with
voracious
bills
growing
too
forward
indeed
as
the
meal
progressed
for
they
stole
the
tartlet
which
he
had
laid
down
in
an
unguarded
moment
on
the
grass
and
shamelessly
snatched
bertie
rokeby
out
of
his
very
hand
i
sure
the
wrights
enjoyed
themselves
isobel
told
her
mother
afterwards
harold
had
seven
rice
buns
and
ten
victoria
biscuits
and
charlotte
and
aggie
ate
a
whole
plateful
of
between
them
belle
says
they
always
have
the
most
enormous
appetites
and
at
her
last
party
eric
took
four
helpings
of
turkey
he
just
gulped
it
down
and
kept
handing
up
his
plate
while
the
others
were
eating
their
first
serving
and
after
that
he
tasted
every
different
dish
on
the
table
it
a
great
trial
for
the
wrights
to
go
to
parties
at
the
barringtons
they
never
get
half
enough
supper
though
they
have
the
most
delightful
magic
lanterns
and
conjurers
ruth
and
edna
were
scarcely
allowed
to
eat
anything
at
tea
barrington
picked
all
the
raisins
out
of
bun
and
made
ruth
put
back
the
jam
tart
she
just
taken
she
said
if
they
were
really
hungry
they
might
eat
some
plasmon
biscuits
she
had
brought
with
her
but
they
must
touch
pastry
and
ruth
was
so
savage
she
filled
her
pocket
with
when
her
mother
looking
she
said
she
did
mean
to
come
away
without
having
tasted
anything
nice
after
all
if
the
barringtons
were
obliged
to
rise
with
unsatisfied
appetites
the
same
certainly
could
not
be
said
of
the
other
guests
the
piles
of
good
things
disappeared
with
much
rapidity
and
at
last
even
the
insatiable
eric
wright
declined
another
bun
it
was
at
this
point
that
stuart
produced
a
special
basket
which
she
had
reserved
for
a
final
surprise
and
raising
the
lid
disclosed
a
row
of
marvellous
little
cakes
each
made
in
the
exact
form
of
a
sea
urchin
with
spines
of
white
sugar
and
the
inside
filled
with
vanilla
cream
it
a
delicate
compliment
to
the
sea
urchins
club
she
said
it
was
my
own
idea
i
sent
to
my
confectioner
at
home
and
asked
him
what
he
could
manage
in
the
matter
i
think
he
has
carried
it
out
very
well
the
cakes
look
so
natural
you
could
almost
imagine
they
had
been
fished
out
of
the
water
quite
a
howl
of
delight
went
up
from
the
young
guests
who
had
never
seen
such
appropriate
confectionery
before
and
the
basket
was
handed
round
by
belle
amid
a
chorus
of
thanks
the
united
sea
urchins
consuming
their
own
effigies
with
much
appreciation
even
ruth
and
edna
at
the
special
request
of
stuart
being
allowed
for
once
to
share
the
treat
though
only
on
the
distinct
understanding
that
they
submitted
peaceably
to
a
dose
of
gregory
powder
if
the
unwonted
dainties
disagreed
with
them
tea
being
over
the
party
broke
up
to
amuse
itself
in
various
ways
most
of
the
children
playing
at
among
the
crumbling
walls
or
chasing
each
other
up
the
winding
staircase
while
a
few
more
adventurous
spirits
took
the
opportunity
of
exploring
the
dungeons
with
a
candle
it
was
deliciously
creepy
down
there
you
could
still
see
the
iron
stanchions
by
which
the
wretched
prisoners
had
been
chained
to
the
wall
and
the
little
hole
through
which
their
daily
portions
of
food
had
been
handed
in
to
them
and
could
imagine
if
you
were
fond
of
recalling
the
past
how
from
their
beds
of
straw
they
would
watch
the
light
fading
from
the
tiny
barred
window
and
shiver
as
they
heard
the
rats
gnawing
at
the
stout
oak
door
or
felt
a
toad
crawl
over
their
feet
in
the
murky
darkness
some
of
the
had
been
busy
marking
out
bounds
in
the
courtyard
and
soon
enlisted
every
one
in
an
exciting
game
of
base
chester
and
the
curate
made
the
most
successful
captains
directing
the
proceedings
with
great
spirit
and
sometimes
by
a
bold
dash
rescuing
the
more
important
of
their
prisoners
and
bertie
rokeby
covered
himself
with
glory
by
quietly
walking
to
the
prison
while
the
opposite
side
was
occupied
in
a
struggle
and
unsuspectedly
freeing
all
the
captives
one
by
one
it
was
warm
work
however
on
a
hot
august
day
and
after
a
time
the
wrights
never
good
runners
subsided
panting
on
to
a
piece
of
ruined
wall
and
even
the
enthusiastic
curate
who
had
pulled
off
his
coat
and
was
prosecuting
the
game
in
his
shirt
sleeves
began
to
show
signs
of
flagging
zeal
i
done
up
cried
chester
at
last
flinging
himself
under
the
shade
of
a
small
elder
tree
near
the
i
have
a
leg
left
to
stand
on
and
i
hoarse
with
shouting
orders
you
better
give
in
and
do
something
quiet
i
do
want
to
see
another
boy
or
girl
for
the
space
of
the
next
so
scoot
all
of
you
anywhere
and
leave
browne
and
myself
to
enjoy
a
smoke
in
peace
chapter
x
wild
maidenhair
on
our
other
side
is
the
rock
and
a
path
is
kept
the
gorge
and
it
by
boulder
stones
where
lichens
mock
the
marks
on
a
moth
and
small
ferns
fit
their
teeth
to
the
polished
block
somewhat
hot
and
tired
with
their
exertions
the
children
dispersed
in
small
groups
to
lounge
about
or
amuse
themselves
in
any
way
they
happened
to
feel
inclined
as
there
was
still
plenty
of
time
before
the
coaches
returned
at
seven
belle
and
isobel
together
with
four
of
the
rokebys
decided
to
stroll
up
the
scar
from
the
top
of
which
they
expected
to
obtain
a
very
good
view
of
the
distant
moorland
together
with
a
wide
stretch
of
sea
a
narrow
path
led
steeply
by
a
series
of
steps
through
the
wood
a
delightful
cool
shady
place
with
soft
moss
spreading
like
a
green
carpet
underfoot
and
boughs
shutting
out
the
sunlight
overhead
trails
of
late
honeysuckle
still
hung
in
festoons
from
the
undergrowth
and
an
occasional
squirrel
might
be
seen
whisking
his
bushy
tail
round
the
bole
of
an
oak
tree
in
a
quest
for
early
acorns
there
was
an
interesting
little
pool
too
where
a
number
of
young
frogs
were
practising
swimming
and
the
children
thought
they
saw
an
otter
but
they
could
not
be
quite
sure
for
it
scurried
off
so
quickly
up
the
bank
that
they
had
not
the
chance
to
get
more
than
a
glimpse
of
it
the
hazel
bushes
were
covered
with
nuts
a
few
of
which
already
contained
kernels
and
clumps
of
ferns
grew
luxuriantly
under
the
shadow
of
the
trees
pleasant
as
it
was
in
the
wood
it
was
even
more
enjoyable
when
they
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
and
seating
themselves
upon
a
thick
patch
of
heather
looked
down
the
other
side
of
the
scar
over
the
rich
undulating
silvan
slope
where
among
great
round
boulders
they
caught
the
glint
of
a
stream
and
heard
in
the
distance
the
rushing
noise
of
a
waterfall
at
the
foot
of
the
incline
in
a
narrow
valley
between
the
scar
and
the
cliffs
which
bounded
the
sea
rose
the
stone
roof
of
a
quaint
old
elizabethan
house
the
timbers
the
wide
mullioned
windows
and
the
ornamental
gables
were
singularly
fine
and
told
of
the
time
when
those
who
built
put
an
artistic
pride
into
their
work
and
thought
no
detail
too
unimportant
to
be
well
carried
out
the
south
side
was
covered
with
a
glorious
purple
clematis
which
hung
in
rich
masses
round
the
pillars
of
a
veranda
below
and
even
from
the
distance
the
flaming
scarlet
of
the
scotch
nasturtium
clothing
the
porch
arrested
the
eyes
by
its
brilliant
contrast
with
the
delicate
that
framed
the
windows
what
a
splendid
place
cried
belle
glancing
beyond
the
twisted
chimneys
to
where
the
smooth
green
lawns
and
gay
beds
of
a
garden
peeped
from
between
the
trees
of
the
shrubbery
just
look
at
the
beautiful
conservatories
and
greenhouses
and
such
stables
there
a
tennis
lawn
on
the
other
side
of
the
flagstaff
and
a
carriage
drive
leading
down
towards
the
road
it
the
nicest
house
i
seen
anywhere
about
silversands
i
wonder
to
whom
it
belongs
and
what
it
called
it
the
chase
and
belongs
to
colonel
smith
i
believe
said
cecil
there
a
huge
on
the
gates
at
any
rate
and
one
day
when
we
were
passing
i
saw
an
old
buffer
going
in
with
a
gun
and
arthur
wright
said
he
was
sure
it
was
colonel
smith
who
has
all
the
shooting
on
the
common
lucky
chap
if
it
were
mine
would
i
have
a
glorious
time
i
keep
ever
so
many
ferrets
and
dogs
in
those
stables
and
go
rabbiting
every
day
in
the
year
i
have
a
very
fast
pony
that
could
fly
like
the
wind
said
winnie
and
i
gallop
all
over
the
moors
and
the
shore
with
my
hair
streaming
out
behind
in
ringlets
like
the
picture
of
diana
vernon
on
the
landing
at
home
you
very
soon
fall
off
remarked
bertie
unsympathetically
seeing
you
ca
even
stick
on
to
a
donkey
on
the
sands
the
little
brown
one
threw
you
twice
this
morning
that
was
because
the
saddle
kept
slipping
said
winnie
indignantly
and
that
particular
donkey
has
a
trick
of
lying
down
suddenly
too
when
it
tired
it
wants
to
get
rid
of
you
i
know
it
does
because
it
rolls
if
you
do
tumble
off
it
did
the
same
with
charlie
chester
the
other
day
and
shot
him
straight
over
its
head
then
it
got
up
and
flew
back
to
the
parade
before
he
could
catch
it
the
pony
would
be
quite
a
different
thing
i
can
tell
you
and
i
soon
learn
to
ride
it
what
would
you
do
belle
if
you
owned
the
chase
i
give
the
most
wonderful
parties
said
belle
and
invite
all
kinds
of
distinguished
people
dukes
and
duchesses
you
know
and
members
of
parliament
and
admirals
and
generals
and
perhaps
even
the
prince
and
princess
of
wales
and
i
send
to
paris
for
my
hats
and
have
my
clothes
made
by
the
court
dressmaker
i
give
a
cricket
match
on
that
lawn
said
isobel
and
ask
all
the
sea
urchins
to
tea
we
have
loads
of
lovely
fruit
from
those
gardens
and
greenhouses
and
when
we
were
tired
of
cricket
we
could
get
up
sports
and
let
off
fireworks
in
the
evening
just
when
it
was
growing
dark
that
what
i
like
to
do
if
i
lived
there
pity
you
do
exclaimed
bertie
we
all
come
but
what
the
use
of
talking
when
you
know
you
never
have
the
chance
i
say
suppose
we
go
down
the
wood
on
this
side
and
try
to
find
the
waterfall
it
must
be
rather
a
one
to
make
such
a
thundering
noise
the
others
jumped
up
very
readily
at
the
suggestion
and
leaving
the
path
they
slid
through
the
steep
wood
and
climbing
a
high
wall
found
themselves
at
the
rocky
bed
of
a
stream
which
rushed
swiftly
along
under
the
overhanging
trees
forming
little
foaming
cascades
as
it
went
at
one
point
the
water
dashing
between
two
steep
crags
descended
in
a
sheer
fall
of
about
thirty
feet
emptying
itself
at
the
bottom
into
a
wide
and
deep
pool
overhung
by
several
fine
mountain
ashes
the
scarlet
berries
of
which
made
a
bright
spot
of
colour
against
the
silvery
green
of
the
foliage
behind
the
rokebys
instantly
rushed
at
these
and
began
tearing
off
quite
large
branches
breaking
the
boughs
in
a
ruthless
fashion
that
went
to
isobel
heart
for
she
always
had
been
taught
to
pick
things
carefully
and
judiciously
so
as
not
to
spoil
the
beauty
of
tree
or
plant
it
grand
stuff
said
cecil
descending
to
the
ground
with
a
crash
and
switching
at
the
ferns
by
the
water
edge
with
his
stick
as
he
spoke
i
got
a
perfect
armful
hullo
what
that
all
down
the
side
of
this
overhanging
rock
it
actually
maidenhair
fern
growing
wild
in
the
open
air
i
going
to
have
some
we
plant
it
in
pots
and
take
it
home
it
was
indeed
the
true
maidenhair
flourishing
on
the
damp
crag
under
the
spray
of
the
waterfall
as
luxuriantly
as
though
it
had
been
in
a
conservatory
its
delicate
fronds
showing
in
large
clumps
wherever
it
could
obtain
a
hold
on
the
rocky
surface
i
grieve
to
say
that
the
rokebys
simply
threw
themselves
upon
it
pulling
it
up
by
the
roots
and
destroying
as
much
as
they
gathered
by
trampling
it
in
their
frantic
haste
o
cecil
cried
isobel
in
an
agony
you
spoiling
the
ferns
they
looked
so
lovely
growing
there
by
the
waterfall
please
do
take
them
all
have
you
got
enough
now
but
he
has
given
any
yet
protested
belle
and
i
must
have
some
one
does
often
get
the
chance
to
find
maidenhair
declared
cecil
so
i
shall
make
the
most
of
it
you
here
belle
you
may
have
this
piece
catch
if
i
climb
a
little
higher
i
can
reach
that
splendid
clump
under
the
tree
i
take
that
to
the
mater
i
think
on
the
whole
you
will
not
my
boy
said
a
dry
voice
from
the
bank
behind
and
looking
round
the
children
to
their
horror
and
astonishment
saw
the
tall
figure
of
an
elderly
gentleman
who
had
stolen
upon
the
scene
unawares
he
spoke
quite
calmly
but
there
was
a
twitch
about
his
mouth
and
a
gleam
in
his
gray
eye
which
suggested
the
quiet
before
a
thunderstorm
and
he
stood
watching
the
group
in
much
the
same
way
as
a
detective
might
have
done
who
had
made
a
sudden
successful
capture
of
youthful
burglars
in
the
act
of
committing
a
felony
may
i
ask
he
observed
with
withering
politeness
by
whose
invitation
you
have
entered
my
grounds
and
by
whose
permission
you
have
been
destroying
my
trees
and
uprooting
my
ferns
i
was
under
the
impression
that
this
was
my
private
property
but
you
evidently
consider
you
are
entitled
not
only
to
annex
my
possessions
but
to
exercise
a
cheap
generosity
by
presenting
them
to
others
i
shall
be
obliged
if
you
will
kindly
offer
me
some
explanation
cecil
was
so
absolutely
transfixed
with
amazement
that
for
a
moment
he
remained
with
his
mouth
wide
open
staring
at
the
newcomer
as
though
the
latter
had
dropped
from
the
skies
the
rokebys
were
not
children
they
did
not
possess
either
the
moral
courage
or
the
good
manners
which
charlie
chester
madcap
though
he
might
be
would
undoubtedly
have
displayed
in
the
same
situation
and
instead
of
meeting
the
matter
bravely
and
making
the
best
apology
he
could
cecil
flung
down
the
ferns
and
without
a
word
of
excuse
took
to
his
heels
and
ran
back
up
the
wood
at
the
top
of
his
speed
closely
followed
by
winnie
bertie
and
arnold
belle
for
an
instant
wavered
but
recognizing
the
old
gentleman
as
the
same
whose
acquaintance
she
had
cultivated
on
the
beach
with
such
unsatisfactory
results
she
decided
that
discretion
was
the
better
part
of
valour
and
turning
away
vanished
through
the
trees
like
a
little
white
shadow
isobel
the
only
one
of
the
six
who
stood
her
ground
was
left
to
bear
the
whole
brunt
of
the
matter
alone
she
looked
at
the
broken
branches
of
mountain
ash
and
the
damaged
ferns
which
the
rokebys
had
dropped
in
the
panic
of
their
flight
and
which
surrounded
her
like
so
much
guilty
evidence
of
the
deed
then
screwing
up
her
courage
she
faced
the
outraged
owner
in
a
kind
of
desperation
i
sorry
she
began
twisting
and
untwisting
her
thin
little
hands
and
colouring
up
to
the
roots
of
her
hair
with
the
effort
she
was
making
we
ought
to
have
come
but
indeed
we
did
know
it
was
your
ground
we
thought
it
was
only
just
part
of
the
scar
and
i
believe
the
others
would
have
taken
the
ferns
if
they
thought
for
a
moment
because
they
would
have
known
maidenhair
does
grow
wild
out
of
doors
like
bracken
or
but
it
wild
said
the
colonel
that
the
unfortunate
part
of
it
it
would
have
distressed
me
if
i
could
have
replaced
it
from
the
conservatory
this
happens
to
be
one
of
the
few
spots
in
the
british
isles
where
is
found
in
an
undoubtedly
native
situation
oh
then
that
worse
than
ever
cried
isobel
with
consternation
i
know
how
very
very
rare
it
is
because
mother
and
i
once
found
a
little
piece
in
a
cave
in
cornwall
did
you
are
you
sure
it
was
an
absolutely
genuine
specimen
and
not
naturalized
asked
colonel
stewart
with
keen
interest
no
it
was
quite
wild
for
it
was
in
a
very
place
by
the
seashore
i
hope
you
did
take
it
oh
no
we
did
even
pick
a
frond
and
mother
made
me
promise
never
to
tell
any
one
where
it
grew
she
was
so
afraid
some
one
might
root
it
up
a
sensible
woman
exclaimed
the
colonel
pity
there
are
more
like
her
why
people
should
want
to
grub
up
every
rare
and
beautiful
thing
they
find
in
the
country
to
plant
in
their
miserable
town
gardens
i
ca
imagine
it
downright
murder
the
poor
things
die
directly
in
the
smoke
look
at
these
splendid
roots
that
have
been
growing
here
since
i
was
a
boy
i
would
rather
they
had
destroyed
every
flower
in
my
garden
than
have
worked
such
wanton
havoc
in
the
spot
i
value
most
in
all
my
grounds
it
most
unfortunate
we
came
this
particular
walk
said
isobel
almost
crying
with
regret
you
see
the
rokebys
are
used
to
the
country
so
they
do
seem
to
think
about
spoiling
things
i
believe
i
could
manage
to
plant
these
roots
again
they
not
very
bad
and
if
i
tucked
them
well
into
the
crevices
of
the
rock
i
really
fancy
grow
she
picked
up
some
of
the
ferns
as
she
spoke
and
began
carefully
to
replace
them
in
the
little
ledges
on
the
side
of
the
rock
moistening
the
roots
first
in
the
stream
and
scraping
up
some
soil
with
a
thin
piece
of
shale
which
she
made
serve
the
purpose
of
a
trowel
they
have
taken
quite
all
she
said
that
beautiful
clump
up
there
has
even
been
touched
and
it
may
spread
i
wish
i
could
put
back
the
mountain
ash
i
simply
ca
tell
you
how
sorry
i
am
we
ever
came
the
colonel
smiled
i
do
blame
he
said
it
was
those
young
heathens
who
ran
away
their
methods
of
studying
botany
were
certainly
of
a
rather
description
i
should
have
thought
better
of
them
if
they
had
stayed
to
apologize
your
friend
with
the
light
curls
whom
i
have
met
before
seemed
also
unwilling
to
enter
into
any
explanations
in
fact
to
put
it
plainly
she
left
you
in
the
lurch
i
think
she
was
frightened
said
isobel
wondering
what
possible
excuse
she
could
frame
for
belle
conduct
you
came
so
so
very
suddenly
there
i
put
all
the
ferns
back
they
rather
broken
afraid
but
there
are
plenty
of
new
fronds
ready
to
come
up
so
i
hope
you
find
that
after
all
we
have
quite
spoilt
everything
think
i
not
so
much
hurt
as
i
imagined
said
the
colonel
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
oh
i
did
mean
that
replied
isobel
quickly
i
know
we
done
a
great
deal
of
harm
please
do
think
i
wanted
to
make
out
we
had
all
right
you
done
your
best
to
repair
the
damage
so
that
an
end
of
the
matter
i
ought
to
be
going
now
continued
isobel
the
rokebys
and
belle
will
be
wondering
what
has
become
of
me
and
the
coaches
were
to
start
at
seven
it
must
be
after
six
now
exactly
six
said
colonel
stewart
consulting
his
watch
if
you
follow
that
footpath
it
will
take
you
through
a
side
gate
and
straight
up
the
hillside
i
expect
you
will
find
the
others
waiting
for
you
on
the
top
of
the
scar
give
my
compliments
to
your
friends
and
tell
them
to
learn
to
enjoy
the
country
without
spoiling
it
for
other
people
and
the
next
time
they
get
into
a
tight
place
to
show
a
little
pluck
and
not
to
run
off
like
a
set
of
cowardly
young
curs
chapter
xi
the
island
oh
had
we
some
bright
little
isle
of
our
own
in
a
blue
summer
ocean
far
off
and
alone
though
the
united
sea
urchins
were
still
very
faithful
to
their
cricket
ground
under
the
cliffs
the
older
and
more
daring
spirits
were
always
ready
to
ramble
farther
afield
in
quest
of
new
scenes
and
adventures
every
day
seemed
to
bring
with
it
some
fresh
delight
whether
it
were
a
shrimping
expedition
among
the
green
pools
of
the
rocks
on
the
far
shore
or
a
cockle
gathering
on
the
gleaming
banks
left
by
the
where
the
breath
of
the
salt
wind
on
their
faces
or
the
feel
of
the
wet
oozing
sand
under
their
bare
feet
was
a
joy
to
be
garnered
up
and
held
in
memory
sometimes
it
was
a
scramble
over
the
moors
between
thickets
of
golden
gorse
and
stretches
of
heather
so
deep
and
long
that
to
lie
in
it
was
to
bury
oneself
like
a
bee
in
a
bed
of
purple
fragrance
or
a
hard
climb
would
take
them
to
the
summit
of
some
neighbouring
hill
where
watching
the
sun
sink
from
a
primrose
sky
into
a
pearly
shimmering
sea
they
would
all
grow
a
little
silent
and
quiet
even
the
roughest
spirits
restrained
in
spite
of
themselves
by
the
sight
of
that
indescribable
majesty
and
calm
which
marks
the
parting
of
the
day
it
is
hours
such
as
these
glad
exhilarating
glorious
hours
when
the
world
seems
as
young
as
ourselves
and
merely
to
live
and
breathe
is
a
delight
that
lay
up
in
our
hearts
a
store
of
sunshine
to
be
drawn
upon
in
after
life
as
from
a
of
the
mind
and
to
brighten
dark
days
to
come
with
the
rapture
of
the
remembrance
it
was
perhaps
somewhat
against
her
natural
tastes
that
belle
found
herself
included
in
the
many
and
various
excursions
of
the
sea
urchins
she
was
no
country
lover
and
the
stir
of
a
promenade
in
a
fashionable
gave
her
more
pleasure
than
the
dash
of
waves
or
the
scent
of
wild
flowers
she
did
not
enjoy
splashing
her
pretty
clothes
with
among
the
rocks
or
tearing
them
in
search
of
blackberries
on
the
hedgerows
and
it
was
only
her
love
of
society
and
a
dislike
of
being
left
behind
which
induced
her
to
follow
where
the
others
led
the
rough
walks
and
hard
scrambles
were
often
a
real
trial
to
her
though
with
isobel
to
tow
her
up
steep
hills
help
her
across
stiles
disentangle
her
laces
from
insistent
brambles
jump
her
over
pools
and
take
her
hand
in
dangerous
spots
she
managed
to
keep
up
fairly
well
isobel
to
whom
these
excursions
were
the
topmost
summit
of
bliss
and
who
was
apt
to
measure
others
standards
by
her
own
never
suspected
for
a
moment
that
belle
was
beginning
to
grow
tired
of
it
and
received
an
occasional
outburst
of
petulance
or
fretful
complaint
with
such
amazement
that
the
latter
would
for
very
shame
desist
and
for
a
time
the
friendship
continued
to
remain
at
mark
that
belle
was
selfish
and
exacting
never
once
crossed
isobel
mind
and
though
she
could
not
help
frequently
detecting
in
her
certain
little
meannesses
exaggeration
or
even
occasional
wanderings
from
the
truth
there
always
seemed
to
be
some
exonerating
circumstance
which
would
in
a
measure
either
clear
her
from
blame
or
give
her
the
benefit
of
a
doubt
it
is
often
so
difficult
to
find
fault
with
those
for
whom
we
care
very
dearly
we
are
ready
to
make
excuses
condone
their
mistakes
overlook
their
shortcomings
anything
but
allow
to
ourselves
the
unfortunate
and
yet
unmistakable
fact
that
our
idol
has
feet
of
clay
and
so
isobel
went
on
from
day
to
day
blinding
her
eyes
with
her
adoration
for
her
namesake
and
investing
belle
with
a
halo
of
virtues
and
attractions
which
certainly
did
not
exist
except
in
her
own
imagination
apart
from
belle
i
think
that
among
the
various
members
of
the
sea
urchins
club
isobel
found
the
chesters
the
most
congenial
they
had
all
the
dash
and
daring
of
the
rokebys
without
the
manners
which
characterized
that
family
whose
friendship
at
times
was
apt
to
prove
a
trifle
wearing
little
hilda
had
taken
a
great
affection
for
isobel
and
charlie
since
the
adventure
in
the
was
disposed
to
consider
her
in
the
light
of
a
chum
and
to
cultivate
her
acquaintance
as
knowing
isobel
meant
including
belle
the
four
children
therefore
might
often
be
found
in
each
other
company
and
it
was
at
charlie
suggestion
that
they
determined
one
afternoon
to
pay
a
visit
to
a
certain
small
island
which
lay
a
short
distance
along
the
coast
at
the
other
side
of
the
rocky
headland
that
jutted
out
at
the
far
side
of
the
bay
i
not
been
close
to
said
charlie
but
you
can
see
it
very
well
from
the
top
of
the
scar
it
looks
a
regular
robinson
crusoe
desert
island
kind
of
a
place
just
given
up
to
and
rabbits
i
believe
a
soul
ever
goes
there
it
would
be
grand
if
we
were
the
first
to
set
foot
on
it
said
isobel
it
would
be
our
own
island
and
we
claim
it
in
the
name
of
the
club
like
travellers
do
in
central
africa
when
they
run
up
the
union
jack
and
then
mark
the
place
pink
on
the
map
to
show
it
a
british
possession
and
then
all
the
others
could
be
settlers
added
hilda
and
light
a
fire
and
cook
fish
and
have
fun
it
would
be
exactly
like
the
coral
island
in
young
pioneers
said
belle
perhaps
i
might
become
the
queen
like
the
mysterious
white
lady
they
found
living
among
the
natives
and
have
a
throne
made
out
of
sand
and
shells
and
wear
a
garland
of
flowers
for
a
crown
oh
we
wo
go
in
for
nonsense
like
that
declared
charlie
who
was
not
romantic
and
moreover
enjoyed
squashing
belle
on
occasion
but
we
might
build
a
hut
there
and
rig
up
a
sort
of
camp
and
then
if
the
whole
lot
of
us
came
we
could
have
a
regular
ripping
time
it
worth
while
going
to
see
at
any
rate
armed
with
a
mariner
compass
a
tin
pail
full
of
biscuits
botanical
case
for
specimens
and
a
stout
stick
apiece
the
four
friends
set
out
on
their
pioneering
expedition
with
all
the
enthusiasm
of
a
band
of
explorers
penetrating
into
the
heart
of
an
unknown
continent
or
a
roman
legion
bent
on
the
conquest
of
some
distant
albion
as
the
geography
books
determine
an
island
to
be
a
piece
of
land
surrounded
by
water
the
particular
spot
in
question
could
only
claim
to
justify
its
name
at
high
tide
since
at
low
water
it
was
joined
to
the
mainland
and
by
scrambling
over
the
rocks
and
jumping
a
few
channels
which
the
sea
had
left
behind
any
one
could
reach
it
quite
easily
dry
shod
the
children
marched
sturdily
along
over
the
wet
sands
with
a
pause
here
and
there
to
dive
after
a
particularly
interesting
crab
or
to
float
a
left
stranded
by
the
tide
in
the
deeper
water
charlie
however
would
not
allow
many
digressions
and
hurried
them
as
fast
as
possible
towards
the
object
of
their
journey
the
island
on
a
nearer
view
proved
to
be
a
bare
craggy
spot
about
half
a
mile
in
length
by
a
quarter
in
breadth
bounded
by
steep
cliffs
which
supported
a
rocky
plateau
covered
with
short
rough
grass
and
sea
pinks
and
honeycombed
in
every
direction
with
rabbit
burrows
it
seemed
the
haunt
of
innumerable
gulls
guillemots
and
puffins
for
whole
flocks
of
them
flew
away
wheeling
overhead
in
wide
circles
and
uttering
loud
piercing
cries
in
protest
at
the
invasion
of
their
rocky
stronghold
we
better
do
the
thing
thoroughly
suppose
we
start
from
this
big
rock
and
walk
right
round
the
island
suggested
isobel
i
have
a
piece
of
paper
and
a
pencil
in
my
pocket
and
i
draw
a
map
of
it
as
we
go
along
and
we
give
names
to
all
the
capes
and
bays
and
headlands
stunning
agreed
charlie
this
rock
can
be
and
we
can
take
it
in
turns
to
christen
the
other
places
i
do
believe
the
island
itself
has
a
name
we
shall
each
have
to
suggest
something
and
then
put
it
to
the
vote
i
for
holme
myself
but
we
decide
anything
yet
until
we
have
been
completely
over
it
thrilled
with
the
excitement
of
the
occasion
the
pioneers
started
on
their
tour
of
inspection
noting
with
approval
that
the
pools
at
the
foot
of
the
cliff
were
full
of
sea
anemones
hermit
crabs
periwinkles
whelks
pink
and
a
wealth
of
desirable
treasures
that
the
brambles
which
grew
on
the
slopes
above
were
already
covered
with
fast
ripening
blackberries
that
there
were
flukes
quite
seven
inches
long
in
the
narrow
channel
on
the
north
shore
and
that
the
sands
beyond
showed
a
perfect
harvest
of
cockles
and
other
shells
they
had
gone
perhaps
halfway
round
the
coast
and
were
on
the
south
side
facing
the
open
sea
when
suddenly
turning
a
corner
they
found
themselves
in
a
spot
which
made
them
stand
still
and
look
at
one
another
with
little
gasps
of
delight
surely
it
was
the
ideal
place
for
a
camp
they
were
in
a
small
creek
between
two
great
overhanging
crags
where
brambles
and
wood
vetch
hung
down
in
delightful
tangled
masses
the
fine
white
sand
under
their
feet
alternated
with
soft
green
turf
spangled
with
tiny
and
there
was
quite
a
bank
of
small
delicate
shells
left
by
the
high
spring
tides
close
under
the
rocks
lay
the
wreck
of
a
schooner
driven
ashore
by
winter
storms
and
stranded
upon
the
shingle
the
broken
spars
and
a
fragment
of
the
hull
lying
half
buried
in
the
silvery
sand
surrounded
by
a
forest
of
and
why
it
just
beats
swiss
family
robinson
or
boy
hollow
said
charlie
turning
to
his
companions
with
something
of
the
look
that
christopher
columbus
may
have
worn
when
he
stepped
with
his
followers
on
to
the
shores
of
the
new
world
here
the
very
place
we
were
hoping
for
we
soon
get
that
old
trail
tilted
out
of
the
sand
she
only
needs
propping
against
the
cliff
and
she
make
a
regular
uncle
tom
cabin
with
the
wrights
and
the
rokebys
to
help
we
haul
her
up
in
a
jiffy
some
of
these
spars
and
planks
would
do
for
seats
and
tables
and
we
could
light
fires
with
the
it
a
camp
almost
ready
made
for
us
i
declare
and
look
cried
hilda
pointing
to
a
which
lay
at
the
mouth
of
the
creek
the
tide
seems
to
have
thrown
up
a
great
many
things
down
there
and
she
hurried
to
the
water
edge
where
the
drifting
current
had
lodged
a
variety
of
miscellaneous
articles
tin
cans
a
child
boat
a
straw
hat
several
baskets
glass
bottles
and
even
a
lady
parasol
all
lying
tangled
among
the
washed
across
the
bay
no
doubt
from
the
beach
at
ferndale
i
fished
out
a
little
horse
and
cart
and
there
something
here
that
looks
like
the
remains
of
a
gentleman
top
hat
we
can
use
the
tins
for
the
cabin
they
do
for
o
charlie
are
you
glad
we
came
it
quite
romantic
said
belle
sitting
down
on
a
spar
and
twisting
some
pink
bindweed
round
her
hat
we
could
have
tea
here
and
get
up
a
dance
on
the
sands
afterwards
i
found
such
a
pretty
among
the
i
mean
to
keep
it
i
do
think
any
one
else
has
discovered
the
island
said
isobel
so
we
quite
a
right
to
take
possession
have
we
it
the
very
thing
we
want
and
we
annex
it
at
once
said
charlie
and
drawing
the
empty
shell
of
a
sea
urchin
from
his
pocket
he
slipped
it
on
to
the
top
of
a
stick
which
he
planted
firmly
in
the
sand
as
an
ensign
then
climbing
on
to
the
summit
of
a
rock
close
by
he
waved
his
handkerchief
to
north
south
east
and
west
exclaiming
we
hereby
take
solemn
possession
of
this
island
in
the
name
of
the
united
sea
urchins
recreation
society
and
are
prepared
to
hold
the
same
in
legal
right
against
all
comers
if
any
one
has
just
cause
or
impediment
to
offer
why
the
said
society
should
not
occupy
this
territory
in
peace
and
prosperity
let
him
speak
now
or
hereafter
for
ever
hold
his
peace
rule
britannia
god
save
the
king
with
a
burst
of
cheers
the
others
unanimously
declared
themselves
witnesses
to
the
deed
and
decided
that
possession
being
of
the
law
the
island
for
the
time
at
any
rate
was
undoubtedly
their
own
and
until
any
one
appeared
to
dispute
their
claim
they
would
make
what
they
pleased
of
it
we
rig
out
a
real
pioneer
party
of
settlers
and
come
with
hammers
and
nails
and
axes
and
all
the
rest
of
it
said
charlie
then
we
can
put
up
a
flag
and
decide
on
names
and
everything
we
have
time
to
explore
the
top
now
though
it
looks
jolly
upon
those
cliffs
we
must
get
back
before
the
tide
turns
it
a
ripping
place
but
it
would
be
no
joke
all
the
same
to
be
surrounded
and
have
to
spend
the
night
here
the
sea
urchins
took
to
the
idea
of
a
camp
on
a
desert
island
with
the
greatest
enthusiasm
and
next
day
the
elder
portion
of
them
started
off
with
any
tools
which
they
could
buy
beg
or
borrow
anxious
to
set
to
work
at
once
upon
the
task
of
constructing
a
dwelling
from
the
wreck
of
the
old
schooner
by
fastening
a
rope
to
the
hull
they
contrived
to
tug
it
out
of
the
sand
and
tilt
it
on
end
against
a
rock
then
with
the
aid
of
the
broken
planks
which
were
lying
near
they
propped
it
up
securely
and
repaired
any
damaged
or
broken
pieces
so
that
it
made
the
most
successful
hut
a
kind
of
combination
of
a
viking
hall
with
a
pirate
cave
or
an
indian
wigwam
the
face
of
the
cliff
which
formed
the
wall
on
one
side
was
full
of
ledges
and
crevices
which
served
admirably
for
cupboards
a
few
nails
driven
into
the
boards
answered
for
hat
pegs
and
it
was
no
difficult
matter
to
put
up
shelves
from
odd
pieces
of
it
was
amazing
how
the
work
brought
out
the
varying
capacities
of
the
settlers
to
every
one
surprise
arthur
wright
developed
a
perfect
genius
for
carpentry
he
had
borrowed
a
few
tools
from
a
friendly
joiner
in
the
town
and
constructed
quite
a
tidy
little
table
forming
the
legs
from
broken
masts
and
he
managed
to
make
a
door
for
the
fortress
of
the
best
portions
of
three
rotten
planks
fastening
it
on
with
hinges
cut
from
an
old
leather
strap
and
even
putting
a
latch
which
would
open
with
a
string
pulled
from
the
outside
while
the
boys
did
the
harder
part
of
the
work
the
girls
contented
themselves
with
the
more
feminine
element
of
artistic
decoration
they
thatched
the
roof
elaborately
with
masses
of
brown
tying
it
securely
with
pieces
of
cord
they
fixed
a
row
of
sea
urchins
with
the
spines
on
over
the
door
as
a
coat
of
arms
one
to
represent
each
member
of
the
club
and
pink
and
white
fan
shells
were
nailed
alternately
round
the
window
with
yellow
periwinkles
wedged
between
a
little
garden
was
carefully
laid
out
a
wall
being
made
of
stones
and
sand
and
a
path
of
fine
gravel
leading
up
to
the
door
green
was
put
down
to
represent
grass
the
most
wonderful
arrangements
in
the
way
of
cockles
mussels
and
limpets
took
the
place
of
and
a
few
and
harebells
planted
in
tins
rescued
from
the
adorned
the
inside
a
fireplace
had
been
built
with
stones
at
the
rocky
end
a
hole
being
made
in
the
roof
to
let
out
the
smoke
and
seats
were
dug
from
the
sand
sufficient
to
accommodate
the
whole
party
a
tin
kettle
and
a
purchased
by
subscription
constituted
the
cooking
utensils
of
the
camp
and
the
members
waxed
so
eager
over
the
domestic
arrangements
of
their
hut
that
they
spent
all
their
pennies
at
the
cheap
stalls
in
the
market
on
tin
mugs
and
plates
and
other
articles
likely
to
be
of
service
to
the
community
eric
wright
denied
himself
toffee
or
caramels
for
three
whole
days
a
heroic
effort
on
his
part
that
he
might
contribute
a
certain
gorgeous
scarlet
on
which
he
had
set
his
young
affections
the
rokebys
clubbed
together
to
buy
muslin
for
window
curtains
belle
presented
a
as
a
suitable
offering
and
barrington
who
was
always
generous
when
it
was
not
a
question
of
diet
allowed
ruth
and
edna
to
purchase
a
dozen
pewter
teaspoons
a
bright
blue
enamelled
teapot
and
a
plate
with
a
picture
of
the
promenade
at
ferndale
upon
it
the
was
rummaged
for
anything
that
would
come
in
handy
and
though
it
did
not
yield
such
wonderful
treasures
as
the
wrecked
ship
generally
contains
in
stories
they
found
several
empty
bottles
an
old
lantern
a
a
wooden
spoon
and
a
battered
all
of
which
they
decided
might
come
in
useful
in
course
of
time
and
were
carefully
put
by
in
a
safe
place
among
the
rocks
isobel
who
toiled
away
at
the
camp
with
untiring
zeal
had
drawn
and
painted
a
very
nice
map
of
the
island
on
a
sheet
of
cardboard
all
the
various
places
being
neatly
marked
and
had
nailed
it
on
the
wall
inside
after
a
good
deal
of
discussion
it
had
been
decided
to
call
the
domain
rocky
holme
the
crag
on
the
extreme
summit
was
point
the
tall
cliff
to
the
north
cape
while
the
one
on
the
south
was
welcome
head
the
creek
where
they
had
established
their
headquarters
was
christened
by
the
appropriate
name
of
sandy
cove
and
the
hut
bore
the
more
romantic
title
of
wavelet
hall
they
had
fixed
a
broken
mast
at
the
end
of
the
little
garden
for
a
flagstaff
and
ran
up
an
ensign
specially
designed
and
executed
for
them
by
stewart
consisting
of
a
large
sea
urchin
cut
out
of
white
calico
and
stitched
upon
a
ground
of
twill
with
the
initials
below
so
that
with
their
colours
floating
in
the
breeze
and
the
smoke
of
their
fire
rising
in
a
thin
white
column
among
the
rocks
no
band
of
colonists
could
have
felt
that
the
country
was
more
really
and
truly
their
own
chapter
xii
a
first
quarrel
the
little
rift
within
the
lute
that
will
make
the
music
mute
and
ever
widening
slowly
silence
all
it
had
become
an
almost
daily
programme
for
the
sea
urchins
to
jump
across
or
even
to
wade
through
the
channel
the
moment
the
tide
was
sufficiently
low
to
enable
them
to
do
so
with
safety
and
to
establish
themselves
upon
their
desert
island
the
joys
of
pioneering
seemed
to
have
quite
put
cricket
in
the
shade
the
hut
had
still
the
charm
of
novelty
and
to
fry
the
flukes
which
they
had
themselves
speared
or
to
concoct
blackberry
jam
or
toffee
in
an
enamelled
saucepan
over
the
camp
fire
was
at
present
their
keenest
delight
the
only
regret
was
that
they
did
not
possess
a
boat
in
which
they
could
row
over
to
their
territory
whenever
they
wished
and
the
boys
had
tried
to
provide
a
substitute
by
constructing
a
raft
from
some
of
the
old
planks
left
lying
about
from
the
schooner
lashing
them
together
with
pieces
of
rope
in
the
orthodox
shipwrecked
sailor
fashion
and
making
paddles
out
of
broken
spars
it
looked
quite
a
respectable
craft
as
charlie
chester
said
most
suitable
for
a
desert
island
and
they
had
anticipated
having
a
good
deal
of
fun
with
it
and
being
able
to
take
little
sea
excursions
if
they
could
only
manage
to
steer
it
properly
and
charlie
even
had
ideas
of
rigging
up
a
sail
and
perhaps
getting
across
the
bay
as
far
as
ferndale
with
a
favourable
wind
its
career
however
was
short
and
brilliant
it
was
launched
with
much
noise
and
nautical
language
by
charlie
and
the
other
boys
and
started
gaily
off
greatly
to
the
admiration
of
the
feminine
portion
of
the
sea
urchins
who
ran
along
the
shore
shouting
encouragement
but
it
had
hardly
gone
more
than
a
hundred
yards
and
was
still
in
shallow
water
when
the
too
enthusiastic
efforts
of
its
amateur
oarsmen
caused
it
suddenly
to
turn
a
somersault
and
upset
the
crew
into
the
briny
deep
then
floating
swiftly
away
bottom
side
up
it
was
caught
by
the
current
much
to
the
regret
of
its
disconsolate
builders
who
wet
through
with
their
unexpected
swim
watched
it
drift
in
the
direction
of
ferndale
where
the
tide
probably
carried
it
over
the
bar
to
wash
about
as
a
derelict
in
the
open
sea
till
the
water
had
rotted
the
ropes
that
bound
the
planks
after
the
raft
proved
a
failure
the
boys
took
to
carving
miniature
yachts
out
of
pieces
of
and
sailing
them
in
a
wide
pool
which
was
generally
left
at
the
mouth
of
the
creek
the
girls
hemmed
the
sails
and
provided
the
vessels
with
flags
in
the
shape
of
tiny
coloured
pieces
of
ribbon
stitched
on
to
the
masts
and
would
stand
by
to
cheer
the
particular
bark
in
which
they
were
interested
as
the
ladies
in
olden
days
encouraged
their
knights
in
the
tourney
there
was
great
competition
between
the
various
boats
and
it
seemed
a
matter
of
the
utmost
importance
whether
charlie
chester
bertie
rokeby
or
arthur
wright
should
reach
the
opposite
shore
in
the
shortest
space
of
time
occasionally
a
good
ship
would
get
becalmed
in
the
middle
of
the
pool
in
which
case
its
owner
would
have
to
wade
to
the
rescue
probably
finding
it
caught
in
a
mass
of
or
even
entangled
in
the
floating
tentacles
of
a
huge
the
children
had
made
a
nice
aquarium
not
far
from
the
hut
and
in
this
they
put
specimens
of
every
different
kind
of
on
the
island
as
well
as
crabs
anemones
limpets
sea
cucumbers
zoophytes
or
any
other
treasures
of
the
deep
that
they
might
be
lucky
enough
to
collect
while
the
boys
i
regret
to
say
took
a
keen
delight
in
securing
a
couple
of
hermit
crabs
and
setting
the
pugnacious
pair
to
fight
in
a
small
arena
of
sand
which
they
prepared
specially
for
the
purpose
somewhat
in
the
same
manner
as
our
unregenerate
forefathers
devoted
certain
portions
of
their
gardens
to
the
formation
of
another
favourite
amusement
was
to
divide
into
two
regiments
each
under
the
leadership
of
suitable
officers
and
armed
with
to
conduct
a
series
of
volunteer
manoeuvres
upon
the
shore
the
defending
party
would
throw
up
ramparts
of
sand
and
duly
garrison
their
stronghold
while
the
enemy
would
attack
with
the
ferocious
zeal
of
a
band
of
north
american
indians
or
a
gang
of
chinese
pirates
being
greeted
by
a
volley
of
fire
from
the
and
missiles
in
the
shape
of
whelks
eggs
the
dried
of
the
little
balls
of
slimy
green
or
anything
else
which
could
be
flung
as
a
projectile
without
injuring
the
recipients
too
severely
very
exciting
struggles
sometimes
took
place
for
the
possession
of
a
fortress
or
the
securing
of
an
outpost
and
i
think
the
girls
were
really
as
keen
as
the
boys
in
this
amateur
warfare
letty
and
winnie
rokeby
proving
deadly
shots
with
their
and
aggie
wright
becoming
quite
an
admirable
scout
isobel
undertook
the
ambulance
department
and
made
a
delightful
hospital
with
beds
dug
out
of
sand
and
a
dispensary
fitted
with
empty
bottles
collected
from
the
she
installed
herself
here
as
a
red
cross
sister
with
ruth
barrington
for
a
helper
and
was
ready
to
doctor
the
combatants
who
were
carried
in
suffering
from
various
imaginary
wounds
the
sole
flaw
in
her
arrangements
being
that
the
invalids
insisted
upon
getting
well
too
quickly
and
leaving
their
pills
and
potions
to
rush
back
and
rejoin
the
fray
the
only
one
of
the
sea
urchins
who
did
not
thoroughly
enjoy
the
charms
of
the
desert
island
was
belle
she
was
not
suited
for
camp
life
and
though
she
tolerated
the
when
she
brought
her
own
china
cup
with
her
she
took
no
interest
in
the
and
frankly
disliked
the
manoeuvres
she
would
not
have
come
at
all
only
she
found
it
so
dull
to
remain
behind
as
her
mother
was
mostly
occupied
in
reading
writing
letters
or
entertaining
friends
and
not
inclined
to
devote
much
attention
to
her
little
daughter
poor
belle
was
expected
to
find
her
own
amusements
and
having
no
resources
in
herself
she
sought
the
society
of
the
other
children
in
preference
to
being
alone
though
she
grumbled
incessantly
at
the
boyish
games
and
longed
for
a
different
sphere
where
pretty
frocks
and
trinkets
would
have
a
better
chance
of
due
appreciation
towards
isobel
the
of
her
first
affection
had
cooled
down
considerably
and
she
had
begun
to
treat
her
friend
with
a
rather
patronizing
authority
ordering
her
about
in
a
way
which
would
have
provoked
any
one
with
a
less
sweet
temper
to
the
verge
of
rebellion
she
had
quarrelled
more
than
once
with
the
wrights
and
the
rokebys
since
those
outspoken
families
had
given
her
their
frank
opinion
of
her
behaviour
on
several
occasions
and
as
it
was
not
a
flattering
one
she
had
been
far
from
pleased
so
long
as
belle
pretty
pleading
manners
secured
for
her
the
best
of
everything
she
was
a
charming
companion
but
she
could
prove
both
pettish
and
peevish
when
she
considered
herself
neglected
her
light
nature
depended
for
its
happiness
on
continual
attention
and
admiration
and
if
she
could
not
have
these
she
was
as
miserable
as
a
butterfly
in
a
shower
of
rain
one
afternoon
the
question
of
the
possession
of
a
certain
basket
supposed
to
be
common
property
among
the
settlers
resulted
in
a
war
of
words
between
belle
and
letty
and
winnie
rokeby
a
quarrel
which
waxed
so
fast
and
furious
that
isobel
who
fought
her
friend
battles
through
thick
and
thin
was
obliged
to
interfere
not
without
an
uneasy
consciousness
that
the
rokebys
had
right
on
their
side
persuaded
letty
to
relinquish
the
disputed
treasure
and
bore
belle
away
up
the
hill
to
soothe
her
ruffled
feelings
by
picking
blackberries
micky
the
little
pet
dog
followed
close
at
their
heels
as
a
rule
he
preferred
the
society
of
stuart
and
rarely
accompanied
the
children
on
their
rambles
but
they
had
brought
him
with
them
to
the
island
it
my
basket
grumbled
belle
threading
her
way
daintily
between
the
brambles
with
a
careful
regard
for
her
flowered
delaine
dress
barrington
lent
it
to
me
first
the
rokebys
are
so
selfish
they
want
to
keep
everything
to
themselves
i
do
know
whether
they
or
the
wrights
are
worse
it
such
a
pretty
one
too
quite
the
nicest
we
have
at
the
hut
never
mind
said
isobel
hastily
anxious
to
dismiss
the
subject
let
us
fill
it
with
blackberries
there
are
such
heaps
here
and
such
big
ones
it
was
indeed
a
harvest
for
those
who
liked
to
gather
brambles
grew
everywhere
long
clinging
sprays
some
still
in
blossom
and
some
covered
with
the
ripe
fruit
trailed
in
profusion
over
the
rocks
their
reddening
leaves
giving
a
hint
of
the
coming
autumn
for
it
was
late
august
now
and
already
there
was
a
touch
of
september
crispness
in
the
air
it
was
delightful
on
the
headland
with
sea
and
sky
spread
all
around
the
flapping
idly
below
just
on
the
verge
of
the
waves
and
banks
of
fragrant
wild
thyme
under
their
feet
growing
in
patches
between
the
great
craggy
boulders
which
looked
as
though
they
had
been
piled
up
by
some
giant
at
play
the
picking
went
on
steadily
for
a
while
though
it
was
a
little
unequal
as
belle
had
a
tender
consideration
for
her
spotless
fingers
and
gathered
about
one
berry
to
isobel
dozen
we
shall
soon
have
the
basket
full
said
isobel
hold
it
for
a
moment
belle
please
while
i
get
to
the
other
side
of
this
rock
there
are
some
still
finer
ones
over
here
i
should
think
we
have
enough
now
said
belle
upon
whom
the
occupation
began
to
pall
we
do
want
to
make
any
more
jam
the
last
we
tried
stuck
to
the
pan
and
burnt
and
wasted
all
the
sugar
i
had
brought
mother
says
she
wo
let
me
have
any
more
come
back
isobel
do
and
take
the
basket
why
what
are
you
staring
at
so
hard
at
this
stone
underneath
the
brambles
replied
isobel
it
most
peculiar
it
has
marks
on
it
like
letters
only
they
are
any
letters
i
know
do
come
and
look
she
pulled
the
long
blackberry
trails
aside
as
she
spoke
and
disclosed
to
view
a
large
stone
something
like
a
lying
on
its
side
half
sunk
into
the
soil
it
was
worn
and
and
battered
by
time
and
storms
but
on
its
smooth
surface
could
still
be
traced
the
remains
of
a
cross
and
the
inscription
illustration
what
does
it
mean
asked
belle
are
they
really
letters
i
ca
tell
replied
isobel
it
looks
like
some
writing
we
read
perhaps
it
greek
or
old
black
letter
i
wonder
who
could
have
put
it
here
i
do
know
and
i
sure
i
do
care
said
belle
what
does
it
matter
let
us
come
along
oh
only
it
interesting
i
want
to
tell
mother
about
it
she
so
fond
of
old
crosses
and
she
may
know
what
it
means
i
can
copy
it
on
this
scrap
of
paper
if
you
wait
a
minute
belle
sat
down
with
a
martyred
air
she
was
not
in
the
best
of
tempers
and
she
did
not
like
waiting
she
put
the
basket
of
blackberries
by
her
side
and
took
micky
on
her
knee
then
for
want
of
anything
better
to
do
she
began
to
tease
him
by
pulling
the
silky
hair
that
grew
round
his
eyes
do
do
that
belle
said
isobel
looking
round
suddenly
at
the
sound
of
micky
protesting
yelps
why
not
asked
belle
somewhat
sharply
because
you
hurting
him
i
not
hurting
him
yes
you
are
i
suppose
i
can
do
as
i
like
with
him
he
my
own
he
not
yours
to
tease
at
any
rate
belle
do
stop
i
please
myself
it
nobody
else
affair
said
belle
giving
such
a
tug
as
she
spoke
to
micky
silken
that
he
howled
with
misery
isobel
sprang
up
she
could
not
bear
to
see
an
animal
suffer
and
her
anger
for
the
moment
was
hot
let
him
go
belle
she
cried
wrenching
at
her
friend
hands
no
right
to
treat
him
so
let
him
go
i
tell
you
micky
seized
the
golden
opportunity
and
escaping
from
his
grasp
beat
a
hasty
retreat
towards
the
beach
yelping
with
terror
as
he
went
and
upsetting
the
basket
of
blackberries
in
his
flight
belle
turned
on
isobel
in
a
rage
look
what
you
done
she
exclaimed
i
wish
you
would
mind
your
own
business
and
leave
me
to
manage
my
own
dog
all
the
blackberries
have
rolled
over
the
cliff
where
we
ca
get
them
and
it
your
fault
i
hope
you
sorry
isobel
stooped
to
rescue
the
empty
basket
but
she
did
not
apologize
i
think
it
was
as
much
your
fault
as
mine
she
replied
you
have
teased
him
perhaps
we
can
pick
the
blackberries
up
again
no
we
ca
they
fallen
among
the
briers
and
do
mean
to
scratch
my
fingers
by
trying
you
can
stay
and
fish
them
out
if
you
like
i
going
home
but
we
have
had
tea
yet
i
do
care
i
do
want
tea
out
of
a
tin
mug
i
shall
have
it
comfortably
at
the
lodgings
with
a
nice
clean
tablecloth
and
a
serviette
i
tired
of
stupid
picnics
and
belle
flounced
away
down
the
hill
with
anything
but
a
sweet
expression
or
a
parisian
manner
isobel
did
not
try
to
stop
her
as
the
proverbial
worm
will
turn
so
there
are
limits
to
the
endurance
of
even
the
most
devoted
of
friends
and
i
think
this
afternoon
she
felt
that
belle
conduct
had
reached
a
climax
for
which
no
excuse
could
be
made
the
latter
who
considered
herself
both
hurt
in
her
feelings
and
offended
in
her
dignity
scrambled
down
to
the
shore
and
calling
micky
to
her
heels
set
off
promptly
for
home
hullo
belle
cried
bertie
rokeby
catching
at
her
dress
as
she
hurried
past
the
hut
look
out
ca
you
do
you
see
that
trampling
all
over
the
shells
that
i
just
laid
out
to
sort
on
the
sand
what
the
row
you
look
like
a
regular
tragedy
queen
lady
macbeth
in
the
murder
scene
or
juliet
about
to
stab
herself
let
me
go
said
belle
crossly
trying
to
pull
herself
free
what
horrid
rough
things
you
boys
are
why
ca
you
leave
me
alone
i
should
like
to
know
we
in
a
jolly
wax
said
bertie
you
as
bad
as
a
cat
with
her
back
up
all
the
same
i
do
want
my
shells
smashed
so
please
to
mind
where
you
stepping
bother
your
shells
said
belle
you
should
leave
them
lying
about
in
people
way
there
you
torn
a
slit
in
my
dress
i
knew
you
would
let
me
go
bertie
rokeby
you
mean
coward
and
jerking
her
skirt
with
an
effort
from
his
grasp
she
started
at
a
run
along
the
beach
and
fled
as
fast
as
she
could
in
the
direction
of
silversands
she
had
reached
the
southern
point
of
the
island
where
they
generally
crossed
the
channel
and
was
hurrying
on
not
looking
particularly
where
she
was
going
her
eyes
half
blinded
with
tears
when
turning
the
headland
sharply
she
ran
full
tilt
against
her
quondam
acquaintance
of
the
parade
who
was
walking
leisurely
along
the
sands
with
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
and
a
breechloader
under
his
arm
the
collision
was
so
sudden
and
unexpected
that
belle
sat
down
swiftly
in
a
pool
of
slimy
green
while
the
gun
knocked
by
the
impact
from
its
owner
grasp
struck
the
rock
violently
and
discharged
both
barrels
into
the
air
the
colonel
who
had
been
almost
upset
with
the
shock
recovered
his
balance
as
by
a
miracle
and
hastened
to
ascertain
the
extent
of
the
mishap
but
finding
no
harm
done
he
picked
up
his
gun
and
surveyed
belle
with
considerable
disfavour
you
might
have
caused
a
very
nasty
accident
young
lady
he
said
it
a
mercy
the
charge
did
land
in
either
your
leg
or
mine
why
do
you
look
where
you
going
belle
raised
herself
carefully
from
the
pool
glancing
with
much
concern
at
the
large
green
stains
which
had
reduced
her
dress
to
a
wreck
and
at
the
moist
condition
of
her
silk
stockings
how
could
i
know
any
one
was
round
the
corner
she
replied
somewhat
sulkily
i
wonder
what
my
mother
would
have
said
if
you
killed
me
i
not
sure
if
my
leg
is
shot
through
after
all
let
me
look
said
the
colonel
quietly
no
that
not
a
wound
though
you
grazed
it
a
little
very
likely
in
falling
there
no
real
damage
and
i
think
you
more
frightened
than
hurt
my
dress
is
spoilt
said
belle
determined
to
have
a
grievance
these
green
stains
will
never
wash
out
of
it
it
really
too
bad
be
thankful
it
only
your
dress
and
not
your
skin
said
the
owner
of
the
chase
with
scant
sympathy
what
are
you
doing
here
so
far
away
from
the
parade
you
had
better
go
home
to
your
mother
and
tell
her
to
take
more
care
of
you
and
not
let
you
wander
about
alone
to
get
into
mischief
i
was
going
home
as
fast
as
i
could
retorted
belle
not
too
politely
for
she
disliked
the
old
gentleman
extremely
and
wished
he
would
not
interfere
with
her
and
i
think
my
mother
knows
how
to
take
care
of
me
without
any
one
telling
her
thank
you
i
have
no
doubt
she
imagines
she
does
replied
colonel
stewart
rather
bitterly
i
ca
say
i
admire
the
result
i
should
certainly
wish
to
teach
you
better
manners
if
i
had
any
share
in
your
bringing
up
i
glad
you
have
said
belle
smartly
and
catching
micky
in
her
arms
she
put
an
abrupt
end
to
the
conversation
by
running
away
again
at
the
top
of
her
speed
over
the
shallows
towards
the
mainland
he
perfectly
horrid
she
said
to
herself
this
is
the
third
place
i
met
him
and
each
time
he
has
been
more
disagreeable
than
the
last
i
ca
imagine
why
but
i
somehow
feel
as
if
he
had
taken
quite
a
dislike
to
me
chapter
xiii
reading
the
runes
words
from
the
long
link
the
dim
past
with
isobel
descended
from
the
headland
in
the
lowest
of
spirits
to
have
quarrelled
with
belle
even
in
a
just
cause
was
a
disaster
such
as
she
had
never
contemplated
and
for
a
moment
she
was
half
inclined
to
run
after
her
friend
and
seek
a
reconciliation
at
any
cost
her
pride
however
intervened
she
felt
that
belle
had
really
been
very
rude
and
unreasonable
while
her
treatment
of
micky
was
quite
unpardonable
she
strolled
along
therefore
in
the
direction
of
the
hut
instead
trying
to
wink
the
tears
out
of
her
eyes
and
to
make
up
her
mind
that
she
did
not
care
all
the
sea
urchins
were
rushing
off
to
investigate
some
mysterious
black
object
which
they
could
see
bobbing
about
in
the
water
and
which
they
hoped
might
prove
to
be
a
porpoise
they
called
to
her
to
join
them
but
even
the
prospect
of
capturing
a
sea
monster
had
for
the
moment
no
charms
so
she
shook
her
head
and
volunteered
instead
to
stay
in
the
hut
and
get
tea
ready
for
their
return
she
filled
the
kettle
from
a
little
spring
of
fresh
water
which
always
ran
pure
and
clear
in
a
small
rivulet
down
the
side
of
the
cliff
threw
some
more
and
dry
on
the
fire
which
the
boys
had
already
lighted
then
set
out
the
tea
things
and
taking
a
piece
of
chalk
began
to
amuse
herself
by
drawing
upon
the
wall
of
the
hut
the
curious
letters
which
she
had
copied
from
the
stone
she
was
so
absorbed
in
her
occupation
that
she
did
not
notice
a
tall
figure
who
stooped
to
enter
the
low
doorway
and
paused
in
some
astonishment
at
the
scene
before
him
hullo
said
a
voice
am
i
addressing
miss
robinson
crusoe
or
is
this
the
outpost
of
a
military
occupation
i
see
a
flag
flying
which
is
certainly
not
the
union
jack
and
as
a
late
colonel
in
his
forces
and
a
justice
of
the
peace
i
feel
bound
to
protect
our
shores
from
a
possible
invasion
isobel
turned
round
hastily
she
recognized
the
newcomer
at
once
as
the
owner
of
the
maidenhair
fern
and
the
beautiful
grounds
into
which
she
had
so
unwittingly
trespassed
and
noticing
his
gun
concluded
that
he
must
without
doubt
be
the
colonel
smith
of
whom
cecil
rokeby
had
spoken
and
whom
she
had
also
heard
mentioned
by
jackson
as
a
keen
sportsman
and
a
magistrate
of
some
consequence
in
the
neighbourhood
i
not
miss
robinson
crusoe
she
replied
laughing
and
it
not
a
military
occupation
either
perhaps
i
am
in
a
prehistoric
dwelling
then
watching
a
descendant
of
the
ancient
britons
conducting
her
primitive
cooking
operations
or
is
it
an
indian
wigwam
i
should
be
interested
to
know
to
what
tribe
it
belongs
said
the
colonel
advancing
farther
into
the
hut
and
looking
with
an
amused
smile
at
the
sand
seats
the
shelves
the
pots
and
all
the
other
little
arrangements
which
the
children
had
made
no
i
not
an
ancient
briton
said
isobel
and
it
is
a
wigwam
it
hall
and
it
belongs
to
us
and
who
is
if
you
will
condescend
to
explain
so
ambiguous
a
term
the
united
sea
urchins
recreation
society
said
isobel
rolling
out
the
name
with
some
dignity
no
doubt
it
my
crass
ignorance
observed
the
colonel
but
afraid
i
have
never
heard
of
that
distinguished
order
will
you
kindly
enlighten
me
as
to
its
object
and
scope
why
you
see
we
all
staying
at
silversands
explained
isobel
so
we
made
ourselves
into
a
club
that
we
might
have
fun
together
and
called
it
the
urchins
then
we
found
this
desert
island
that
does
belong
to
anybody
so
we
took
possession
of
it
and
built
this
hut
out
of
the
wreck
of
the
old
schooner
and
it
ours
now
is
it
said
the
colonel
dryly
i
was
under
the
impression
that
the
island
belonged
to
me
it
is
certainly
included
among
my
and
as
lord
of
the
manor
i
am
also
supposed
to
have
the
rights
of
the
foreshore
i
do
quite
understand
what
of
the
manor
means
said
isobel
but
does
the
island
really
and
truly
belong
to
you
really
and
truly
i
keep
it
for
rabbit
shooting
exclusively
then
said
isobel
apprehensively
i
very
much
afraid
that
been
trespassing
on
your
land
again
not
only
trespassing
but
squatting
returned
the
colonel
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
the
case
is
serious
this
island
has
belonged
to
me
and
to
my
ancestors
for
generations
i
arrive
here
to
find
it
occupied
by
a
band
of
individuals
who
i
must
say
with
a
glance
out
through
the
door
at
the
barefooted
sea
urchins
yelling
in
the
distance
as
they
hauled
up
the
dead
porpoise
bear
a
very
strong
resemblance
to
a
gang
of
pirates
i
am
frankly
informed
by
one
of
their
number
that
they
claim
possession
of
my
property
i
find
their
flag
flying
and
a
fortress
erected
the
question
is
whether
i
am
at
once
to
declare
war
and
evict
these
invaders
or
to
allow
them
to
remain
in
the
position
of
vassals
on
payment
of
a
due
tribute
oh
please
let
us
stay
implored
isobel
we
wo
do
any
harm
we
wo
indeed
we
all
going
home
in
a
few
weeks
and
then
you
can
have
the
island
quite
to
yourself
again
suppose
i
were
to
regard
you
as
surety
for
the
good
behaviour
of
the
rest
of
the
tribe
said
the
colonel
would
you
undertake
that
no
rare
or
cherished
plants
should
be
uprooted
or
any
damage
inflicted
during
your
tenancy
we
would
touch
anything
declared
isobel
we
only
taken
the
blackberries
because
there
are
so
many
of
them
i
know
you
thinking
of
the
maidenhair
oh
please
is
it
growing
i
do
so
hope
it
spoilt
yes
it
growing
i
really
do
believe
it
has
suffered
very
much
after
all
i
took
a
look
at
it
this
morning
and
found
the
young
fronds
pushing
up
as
well
as
if
they
had
never
been
disturbed
i
glad
said
isobel
with
a
sigh
of
relief
i
often
thought
about
it
since
it
very
kind
of
you
to
say
we
may
stay
here
it
would
have
seemed
so
hard
to
turn
out
after
we
had
the
trouble
of
building
the
hut
but
what
about
the
rent
inquired
the
colonel
will
you
be
answerable
for
its
proper
payment
i
may
prove
as
tough
a
customer
as
old
shylock
and
insist
on
my
pound
of
flesh
we
very
little
money
i
afraid
said
isobel
timidly
we
spent
all
the
club
funds
on
buying
the
kettle
and
the
even
what
we
saved
up
for
a
feast
at
the
end
of
the
holidays
i
only
got
threepence
left
myself
though
perhaps
some
of
the
others
may
have
more
i
must
take
it
in
kind
then
the
sort
of
tribute
that
is
exacted
from
native
chiefs
in
central
africa
though
you
ca
bring
me
pounds
of
rubber
or
elephants
tusks
here
we
could
pick
you
blackberries
if
you
like
them
suggested
isobel
or
get
you
cockles
and
mussels
from
the
shore
sometimes
the
boys
spear
flukes
they
rather
small
and
muddy
but
they
quite
nice
to
eat
with
bread
and
butter
if
you
fry
them
yourself
my
consumption
of
blackberries
is
limited
replied
the
colonel
and
there
seems
slight
demand
for
in
my
kitchen
the
flukes
might
have
done
but
if
they
are
only
edible
when
you
fry
them
yourself
afraid
it
no
use
for
i
do
believe
my
housekeeper
would
allow
me
to
try
no
i
must
think
out
the
question
of
tribute
and
let
you
know
i
wo
ask
a
rack
rent
i
promise
you
and
i
suppose
i
could
distrain
on
these
tea
things
and
the
kettle
if
it
were
not
paid
up
the
latter
appears
to
be
boiling
over
at
this
instant
so
it
is
cried
isobel
lifting
it
off
in
a
hurry
i
wonder
she
continued
shyly
if
you
would
care
to
have
a
cup
of
tea
i
could
make
it
in
a
moment
if
you
would
mind
drinking
it
out
of
a
tin
mug
miss
robinson
crusoe
is
very
hospitable
i
have
had
a
picnic
for
years
the
tin
mug
will
recall
my
early
soldiering
days
i
have
bivouacked
in
places
which
were
not
nearly
so
comfortable
as
this
he
took
a
seat
in
a
sand
armchair
and
looked
on
with
amusement
while
isobel
made
her
preparations
something
in
the
set
of
her
slim
little
figure
and
the
fall
of
her
long
straight
fair
hair
attracted
him
and
he
caught
himself
wondering
of
whom
her
gray
eyes
reminded
him
he
liked
the
quiet
way
she
went
about
her
business
and
her
frank
unaffected
manners
so
different
from
belle
assurance
why
ca
the
other
child
wear
a
plain
holland
frock
he
thought
it
would
look
much
more
suitable
for
the
sands
than
those
absurd
costumes
what
a
pity
she
has
the
sense
of
this
one
well
it
no
use
it
evidently
is
in
her
and
i
doubt
if
any
amount
of
training
at
a
good
school
will
make
much
difference
isobel
in
the
meantime
having
brewed
the
tea
handed
it
to
him
upon
the
scarlet
tray
i
sorry
we
have
a
cream
jug
she
apologized
we
always
bring
our
milk
in
medicine
bottles
do
you
mind
sugar
out
of
the
packet
i
wish
i
had
some
cake
but
jackson
did
put
any
in
my
basket
and
i
do
like
taking
the
others
without
asking
them
i
hope
it
nice
she
added
anxiously
i
so
afraid
the
water
a
little
smoked
delicious
said
the
colonel
who
would
have
consumed
far
more
unpalatable
viands
sooner
than
hurt
her
feelings
and
who
tried
to
overlook
the
fact
that
the
tin
mug
gave
the
tea
a
curious
flavour
and
the
bread
and
butter
was
of
a
thickness
usually
meted
out
to
schoolboys
but
are
you
going
to
have
any
yourself
not
now
thank
you
i
rather
wait
for
the
others
i
promised
to
have
everything
ready
for
them
when
they
came
back
i
see
you
put
the
kettle
on
and
take
it
off
again
also
as
they
appear
to
have
run
away
no
more
thanks
one
cup
is
as
much
as
is
good
for
me
why
in
the
name
of
all
that
mysterious
who
has
been
writing
these
the
colonel
jumped
up
and
strode
to
the
other
end
of
the
hut
having
suddenly
caught
sight
of
the
quaint
letters
which
isobel
had
drawn
upon
the
wall
i
have
replied
isobel
simply
then
my
dear
miss
robinson
crusoe
may
i
ask
how
you
came
to
be
acquainted
with
runic
characters
i
do
know
what
they
are
said
isobel
it
very
queer
writing
is
it
i
was
only
copying
it
for
fun
where
did
you
copy
it
from
it
on
a
stone
at
the
top
of
the
headland
this
headland
yes
just
above
here
but
a
little
farther
on
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
there
is
a
stone
bearing
letters
like
that
on
these
cliffs
yes
it
a
long
kind
of
stone
something
like
a
cross
without
arms
i
thought
i
had
walked
over
every
inch
of
this
island
yet
i
have
never
noticed
it
it
was
quite
covered
with
brambles
said
isobel
i
found
it
when
we
were
picking
blackberries
i
had
to
pull
them
all
away
before
i
could
see
it
if
you
can
leave
your
domestic
cares
i
should
very
much
like
you
to
show
it
to
me
said
the
colonel
i
happen
to
be
particularly
interested
in
such
stones
i
go
at
once
said
isobel
putting
the
kettle
among
the
ashes
where
it
could
not
boil
over
and
slamming
on
her
hat
it
looks
ever
so
worn
and
old
but
the
letters
are
cut
in
the
stone
like
they
are
on
graves
she
led
the
way
up
the
steep
narrow
path
which
scaled
the
hill
on
to
the
cliff
above
and
after
a
little
hunting
about
found
the
brambly
spot
which
had
been
the
scene
of
her
quarrel
with
belle
the
owner
of
the
island
knelt
down
and
examined
the
stone
intently
for
some
moments
to
think
that
i
must
have
passed
this
place
dozens
and
dozens
of
times
and
never
have
known
of
its
existence
he
said
at
last
i
have
searched
the
neighbourhood
so
often
for
some
record
of
the
viking
period
strange
that
it
should
be
found
now
by
the
chance
discovery
of
a
child
are
they
really
letters
then
inquired
isobel
is
it
some
foreign
language
yes
they
are
runes
very
old
and
perfect
ones
the
runic
characters
were
used
by
our
teutonic
forefathers
before
they
learned
the
roman
alphabet
this
stone
shows
that
long
long
ago
the
northmen
have
been
here
the
same
northmen
who
came
in
their
great
ships
and
burnt
the
abbey
and
killed
alcuin
at
the
altar
asked
isobel
keenly
interested
very
likely
or
their
sons
or
grandsons
why
did
they
write
upon
a
stone
here
it
was
set
up
as
a
monument
just
like
a
grave
stone
in
a
churchyard
but
if
the
northmen
were
pagans
why
is
there
a
cross
carved
on
the
stone
many
of
them
settled
in
this
country
and
became
christians
and
turned
farmers
instead
of
perhaps
the
monks
went
back
to
the
abbey
afterwards
and
taught
them
suggested
isobel
i
always
thought
they
must
have
felt
so
ashamed
of
themselves
for
running
away
they
could
all
be
saints
like
alcuin
but
they
might
do
their
best
to
make
up
no
doubt
they
did
they
were
brave
men
in
those
days
who
were
not
afraid
to
risk
their
lives
it
is
possible
that
a
small
chapel
may
have
been
built
here
once
though
the
very
memory
of
it
has
passed
away
is
some
one
buried
here
then
yes
put
into
english
characters
the
inscription
runs
suarti
risti
krus
thana
aft
fiak
sun
that
is
to
say
ulf
raised
this
cross
for
fiak
his
i
wish
we
knew
who
they
were
said
isobel
the
son
must
have
died
first
perhaps
he
was
killed
in
battle
and
then
his
father
would
put
up
this
cross
how
very
sorry
he
must
have
felt
very
said
the
colonel
sadly
especially
if
he
were
his
only
son
it
is
hard
to
see
the
green
bough
taken
while
the
old
branch
is
spared
my
father
died
fighting
said
isobel
softly
but
his
grave
is
ever
so
far
away
in
south
africa
and
so
is
my
son
death
reaps
his
harvest
and
hearts
are
as
sore
whether
it
is
the
twentieth
century
or
the
tenth
customs
change
very
little
we
put
up
monuments
to
show
the
of
those
we
love
and
a
thousand
years
ago
black
ulf
raised
this
cross
that
fiak
his
son
should
not
be
forgotten
and
he
not
forgotten
said
isobel
because
we
found
it
all
this
long
time
afterwards
i
did
know
what
it
meant
until
you
told
me
so
glad
i
can
read
it
now
i
want
to
tell
mother
she
likes
old
monuments
or
any
kind
of
old
things
she
has
evidently
taught
you
to
think
and
to
use
your
eyes
said
the
colonel
or
you
would
not
have
copied
the
inscription
and
then
i
might
never
have
discovered
the
stone
what
a
pity
that
would
have
been
returned
isobel
i
was
very
lucky
to
find
it
do
you
think
it
makes
up
a
little
for
the
maidenhair
completely
though
remember
i
did
blame
you
for
that
incident
it
was
your
friends
the
same
young
ruffians
i
believe
who
are
racing
up
the
sands
now
dragging
some
carcass
behind
them
oh
they
coming
back
for
tea
cried
isobel
and
i
forgot
all
about
the
kettle
i
hope
it
has
boiled
away
i
ought
to
go
you
told
me
yet
please
what
you
would
like
us
to
bring
you
instead
of
rent
for
the
island
i
should
like
to
know
so
that
i
can
tell
the
others
i
take
this
discovery
in
lieu
of
all
payment
declared
the
colonel
you
and
your
companions
the
sea
urchins
are
welcome
to
have
free
run
of
the
place
while
you
are
here
little
friend
you
always
seem
to
turn
up
in
exceptional
circumstances
you
and
i
appear
to
have
a
few
interests
in
common
so
i
hope
that
some
time
i
may
have
the
pleasure
of
meeting
you
again
chapter
xiv
a
wet
day
oft
expectation
fails
and
most
oft
there
where
most
it
promises
and
oft
it
hits
where
hope
is
coldest
and
despair
most
sits
the
estrangement
between
isobel
and
her
friend
was
of
very
short
duration
after
all
that
same
evening
they
had
met
on
the
parade
and
belle
had
run
up
with
her
former
affectionate
manner
so
completely
ignoring
the
remembrance
of
any
differences
between
them
that
isobel
thankfully
let
the
matter
slide
only
too
glad
to
resume
the
friendship
on
the
old
terms
and
hoping
that
such
an
unpleasant
episode
might
not
occur
again
the
two
had
arranged
to
make
an
expedition
together
to
the
old
town
on
the
following
day
but
the
morning
proved
so
very
wet
that
it
was
impossible
for
any
one
to
go
out
of
doors
it
a
perfect
deluge
of
a
day
said
isobel
looking
hopelessly
at
the
ceaseless
drip
drip
which
descended
from
the
leaden
skies
it
seem
as
if
it
ever
meant
to
clear
up
again
i
think
it
must
have
rained
like
this
on
the
first
morning
of
the
flood
it
could
have
been
worse
at
any
rate
the
back
of
a
does
not
as
a
rule
afford
the
most
brilliant
of
views
so
the
scene
which
met
isobel
eyes
was
hardly
calculated
to
raise
her
spirits
the
paved
yard
behind
was
swimming
with
water
through
which
a
drenched
and
disconsolate
tabby
cat
excluded
from
the
paradise
of
the
kitchen
was
attempting
to
pick
its
way
shaking
its
paws
at
every
step
marine
terrace
being
a
comparatively
new
row
the
back
premises
were
still
in
a
somewhat
unfinished
condition
and
instead
of
gardens
and
your
eye
was
greeted
by
heaps
of
sand
and
mortar
bricks
and
rubbish
not
yet
carted
away
by
the
builders
which
added
to
piles
of
empty
bottles
and
old
hampers
gave
a
rather
forlorn
appearance
to
the
place
after
watching
pussy
struggles
with
the
elements
and
seeing
her
finally
seek
refuge
in
the
isobel
took
a
turn
to
the
front
door
and
stood
looking
over
the
parade
where
the
rolling
mist
almost
obscured
all
sight
of
the
sea
and
sky
and
water
were
of
the
same
dull
neutral
gray
the
road
was
empty
not
even
the
most
venturesome
visitors
having
braved
the
wind
and
weather
that
morning
while
biddy
herself
usually
as
punctual
as
the
clock
had
evidently
decided
it
was
too
wet
a
day
to
vend
her
fish
there
was
absolutely
nothing
to
be
seen
nevertheless
isobel
would
have
stood
there
watching
the
endless
drops
falling
from
the
unkindly
skies
had
not
jackson
appeared
from
the
kitchen
and
declaring
that
the
rain
was
beating
into
the
hall
firmly
closed
the
door
and
shut
out
any
further
prospect
you
get
cold
too
missy
she
said
standin
in
a
full
draught
for
polly
will
leave
that
back
door
open
say
what
i
will
and
it
turns
chilly
of
a
wet
day
one
can
have
too
much
fresh
air
to
my
mind
there
was
a
gentleman
stayed
here
last
summer
now
just
crazy
he
was
on
what
he
called
bathed
regular
every
morning
before
breakfast
no
matter
how
the
tide
might
be
i
warned
him
it
was
his
health
to
go
in
the
water
on
an
empty
stomach
but
he
did
take
no
notice
of
what
i
said
and
lay
out
on
damp
sand
and
sat
under
open
windows
till
he
ended
up
with
a
bad
bout
of
the
with
the
doctor
every
day
and
me
turned
sick
nurse
to
poultice
him
emma
jane
bein
at
home
then
or
i
could
have
found
the
time
to
do
it
i
no
opinion
of
these
modern
health
dodges
as
folks
sets
such
store
by
now
in
my
young
days
we
never
so
much
as
thought
about
drains
and
if
the
was
at
the
back
door
no
one
was
any
the
worse
for
it
i
call
it
interferin
the
way
these
inspectors
come
round
sayin
you
must
even
throw
a
bucket
of
potato
skins
down
in
your
own
yard
nuisance
indeed
it
them
as
is
the
nuisance
their
nasty
disinfectants
smell
far
worse
to
my
mind
than
a
few
cabbage
leaves
my
grandmother
lived
to
and
never
slept
with
her
bedroom
window
open
in
her
life
not
even
on
the
hottest
of
summer
days
and
drew
her
drinkin
water
regular
from
the
churchyard
well
which
they
tell
you
now
is
swarmin
with
or
whatever
they
call
i
never
saw
any
though
i
let
my
pail
down
in
it
many
a
time
and
it
was
a
deal
sweeter
and
fresher
to
my
taste
than
what
you
get
laid
on
in
lead
pipes
jackson
may
go
in
for
this
if
he
likes
votin
for
all
kinds
of
improvements
by
the
town
council
which
only
adds
to
the
rates
i
an
woman
and
stick
to
country
ways
and
i
think
draughts
is
draughts
and
gives
folks
colds
and
toothaches
call
by
what
names
you
will
judging
the
weather
to
be
absolutely
hopeless
and
without
the
slightest
intention
of
clearing
up
isobel
went
back
to
the
where
polly
had
just
taken
away
the
breakfast
things
and
looked
round
for
some
means
of
amusing
herself
i
do
believe
the
postman
has
been
yet
she
said
what
a
terrible
day
for
him
to
go
round
i
should
think
he
feels
as
if
he
ought
to
come
in
a
boat
why
there
his
now
i
wonder
if
there
are
any
letters
for
us
i
do
expect
there
will
be
said
stewart
my
correspondence
is
not
generally
very
large
i
think
i
shall
go
and
see
just
for
something
to
do
said
isobel
and
running
into
the
hall
she
returned
presently
with
a
letter
in
her
hand
it
for
you
mother
she
said
the
people
in
the
had
five
and
the
family
in
the
had
seven
and
two
parcels
are
they
lucky
there
was
even
one
for
polly
but
jackson
told
her
to
put
it
in
her
pocket
and
not
to
read
it
till
she
had
got
the
beds
made
i
sure
she
take
a
peep
at
it
all
the
same
i
wish
some
one
would
write
to
me
i
have
had
even
a
picture
since
i
came
the
appearance
of
the
letter
which
had
just
arrived
seemed
to
cause
stewart
an
unusual
amount
of
agitation
she
turned
it
over
in
her
hand
glanced
at
isobel
hesitated
a
moment
and
finally
took
it
unopened
to
her
bedroom
that
she
might
read
it
in
private
it
is
my
reply
at
last
she
said
to
herself
i
thought
he
could
surely
not
fail
to
send
me
an
answer
i
wonder
what
he
has
to
say
i
feel
as
though
i
scarcely
dare
to
look
with
trembling
fingers
she
tore
open
the
envelope
and
unfolding
the
sheet
of
notepaper
read
as
follows
the
chase
silversands
dear
madam
i
have
delayed
replying
sooner
to
your
communication
as
i
wished
to
thoroughly
inform
myself
upon
the
question
which
you
put
before
me
acting
on
your
suggestion
i
have
without
her
knowledge
noted
the
general
disposition
demeanour
and
tastes
of
your
daughter
and
finding
they
are
of
a
nature
such
as
would
not
make
a
closer
intimacy
congenial
to
either
of
us
i
must
beg
to
decline
your
proffered
meeting
as
i
would
wish
however
that
my
son
child
should
receive
a
fitting
education
i
am
about
to
place
to
her
credit
the
sum
of
per
annum
to
defray
her
expenses
at
any
good
school
that
you
may
select
from
a
list
which
will
be
submitted
to
you
shortly
by
my
solicitor
he
has
full
instructions
to
conduct
all
further
arrangements
and
i
should
prefer
any
future
communication
from
you
to
be
only
of
a
business
believe
me
to
remain
yours
truly
everard
stewart
stewart
flung
down
the
letter
with
a
cry
of
indignation
illustration
stewart
and
isobel
on
the
moor
page
what
does
he
mean
she
asked
herself
where
can
he
have
seen
isobel
to
my
knowledge
she
has
spoken
to
nobody
except
this
old
colonel
smith
and
a
few
of
the
townspeople
how
can
he
have
her
disposition
demeanour
and
tastes
and
if
so
what
fault
can
he
possibly
find
with
my
darling
is
it
mere
prejudice
and
a
determination
on
his
part
to
avoid
any
reconciliation
if
i
were
not
so
wretchedly
poor
i
would
not
accept
one
farthing
of
this
money
for
her
but
i
must
i
must
it
is
not
right
that
my
pride
should
stand
in
the
way
of
her
education
and
for
this
i
must
humble
myself
to
take
his
charity
he
is
a
stern
man
to
have
kept
up
the
for
so
many
years
every
line
of
his
letter
shows
that
he
is
opposed
to
me
still
though
he
has
never
seen
me
in
his
life
and
instead
of
loving
isobel
for
her
father
sake
he
is
prepared
to
hate
her
for
mine
we
are
so
friendless
and
alone
in
the
world
that
it
seems
hard
the
one
relation
who
i
thought
might
have
taken
an
interest
in
my
child
should
cast
her
off
thus
well
it
makes
her
doubly
mine
and
if
she
can
never
know
her
grandfather
beautiful
home
my
love
must
be
compensation
for
what
she
has
lost
my
one
little
ewe
lamb
is
everything
to
me
and
though
i
would
have
given
her
up
for
the
sake
of
seeing
her
recognized
it
would
have
nearly
broken
my
heart
to
part
with
her
she
put
the
letter
carefully
away
and
went
down
again
to
the
where
isobel
was
standing
by
the
window
gazing
disconsolately
at
the
streaming
rain
with
just
a
suspicion
of
two
in
her
eyes
for
she
did
not
like
to
be
left
alone
and
stewart
had
been
long
upstairs
never
mind
my
sweet
one
said
her
mother
stroking
the
pretty
smooth
hair
it
is
a
disappointing
day
but
we
will
manage
to
enjoy
ourselves
together
you
and
i
in
spite
of
rain
or
any
other
troubles
suppose
we
go
through
all
your
collections
you
could
write
the
names
under
the
wild
flowers
you
have
pressed
arrange
the
shells
in
boxes
and
float
some
of
the
on
to
pieces
of
isobel
cheered
up
at
once
at
the
idea
of
something
definite
to
do
and
the
table
was
very
soon
spread
over
with
the
various
treasures
she
had
gathered
upon
the
beach
silversands
was
a
good
place
for
shells
and
she
had
many
rare
and
beautiful
kinds
from
pearly
cowries
to
scallops
and
wentletraps
she
sorted
them
out
carefully
putting
big
little
and
ones
in
separate
heaps
she
had
great
ideas
of
what
she
would
do
with
them
when
she
was
at
home
again
intending
to
construct
shell
boxes
photo
frames
and
various
other
knickknacks
in
imitation
of
the
wonderful
things
which
were
sold
at
the
near
the
railway
station
if
i
could
make
a
very
nice
frame
mother
she
said
i
should
like
to
send
it
to
jackson
for
a
christmas
present
to
put
emma
photo
in
i
believe
she
be
quite
pleased
to
hang
it
up
in
the
kitchen
with
the
funeral
cards
i
might
manage
a
shell
box
for
old
biddy
too
it
would
scarcely
do
for
a
handkerchief
box
because
i
do
believe
she
ever
uses
such
a
thing
as
a
pocket
handkerchief
but
i
dare
say
she
would
like
it
to
put
something
in
do
you
think
the
shells
would
stick
on
to
tin
if
we
made
the
glue
strong
enough
i
could
do
a
then
for
cass
the
coastguard
one
that
he
could
keep
in
the
parlour
for
best
i
afraid
you
will
have
to
collect
more
shells
if
you
intend
to
make
so
many
presents
said
stewart
i
think
however
that
we
might
manufacture
some
pretty
out
of
these
large
fan
shells
by
boring
holes
in
the
ends
fastening
them
together
with
bows
of
ribbon
and
gluing
a
small
velvet
cushion
in
between
that
would
be
delightful
cried
isobel
and
something
quite
different
to
give
people
i
afraid
they
rather
tired
of
my
needle
books
and
stamp
cases
i
wish
we
could
think
of
anything
to
do
with
the
we
going
to
float
them
on
to
pieces
of
paper
and
when
they
are
dry
we
will
paste
them
in
a
large
scrap
album
and
find
out
their
names
from
a
book
which
i
think
i
can
borrow
from
the
free
library
at
home
i
do
quite
know
how
to
float
them
you
must
watch
me
do
this
one
and
then
you
will
be
able
to
manage
the
rest
first
i
going
to
fill
this
basin
with
clean
water
and
put
this
pretty
pink
piece
to
float
in
it
now
you
see
i
am
slipping
this
sheet
of
notepaper
underneath
and
drawing
it
very
carefully
and
gently
from
the
water
so
that
the
remains
spreads
out
upon
the
paper
i
shall
pin
the
sheet
by
its
four
corners
on
to
this
board
and
when
it
is
dry
you
find
that
the
has
stuck
to
the
paper
as
firmly
as
if
it
had
been
glued
it
not
really
difficult
but
it
needs
a
little
skill
to
lift
the
sheet
from
the
water
without
disarranging
your
this
one
lovely
said
isobel
i
must
try
to
do
the
green
piece
next
how
jolly
they
look
when
they
are
all
nicely
pasted
into
a
book
i
wonder
if
it
will
be
difficult
to
find
out
the
names
rather
hard
to
tell
our
flowers
is
it
sometimes
but
i
think
we
are
improving
in
our
botany
how
many
different
kinds
have
we
pressed
since
we
came
here
forty
i
counted
them
yesterday
and
we
have
at
home
we
shall
soon
have
the
drawer
quite
full
do
you
think
i
might
look
at
the
scabious
that
i
put
under
your
big
box
last
night
i
afraid
you
will
spoil
it
if
you
peep
at
it
too
soon
when
i
was
a
little
girl
my
brother
and
i
used
sometimes
to
amuse
ourselves
by
putting
specimens
to
press
under
the
leaves
of
an
old
and
pledging
each
other
not
to
look
at
them
for
a
year
it
was
rather
hard
sometimes
to
keep
our
vows
but
the
flowers
were
most
beautifully
dried
when
we
took
them
out
again
some
day
we
will
start
a
collection
of
pressed
ferns
they
are
really
easier
to
do
than
wild
flowers
because
they
keep
their
colour
while
the
pretty
blue
of
harebells
or
speedwells
always
seems
to
fade
away
i
done
three
already
said
isobel
successfully
arranging
a
delicate
piece
of
pink
coralline
with
the
point
of
a
hat
pin
afraid
this
next
white
one
will
be
very
difficult
it
so
thick
you
ca
float
that
it
a
zoophyte
not
a
real
and
indeed
not
a
vegetable
at
all
but
the
very
lowest
form
of
animal
life
you
must
hang
it
up
to
dry
like
you
do
the
long
pieces
of
we
try
to
get
the
messy
work
done
this
morning
so
that
we
can
clear
the
table
for
polly
to
lay
dinner
and
in
the
afternoon
i
thought
you
might
finish
your
for
binks
there
is
not
much
to
be
done
to
it
now
and
then
i
can
make
it
up
for
you
oh
that
would
be
nice
when
can
we
go
and
see
him
i
believe
my
foot
will
be
strong
enough
by
thursday
so
you
shall
write
a
letter
to
him
after
dinner
and
say
so
how
jolly
i
longing
to
see
the
white
coppice
and
the
balk
and
binks
i
hope
she
wo
forget
to
bake
the
cranberry
cake
i
shall
have
to
write
a
very
neat
letter
i
want
to
copy
out
the
runic
inscription
too
on
to
a
fresh
piece
of
paper
yes
do
dear
if
my
ankle
bears
me
safely
as
far
as
the
white
coppice
i
shall
certainly
venture
to
the
island
afterwards
and
take
a
sketch
of
the
stone
it
a
most
interesting
discovery
colonel
smith
said
he
was
going
to
have
it
raised
up
said
isobel
half
of
it
you
see
is
buried
in
the
ground
he
was
sure
whether
he
would
leave
it
where
it
is
or
take
it
to
his
house
he
so
dreadfully
afraid
if
he
lets
it
stay
on
the
island
that
horrid
cheap
trippers
might
come
some
time
and
carve
their
names
on
it
he
says
the
brambles
growing
over
it
have
kept
it
safe
so
far
i
wish
you
knew
him
mother
he
kind
belle
says
she
does
like
him
at
all
but
i
do
i
think
it
very
good
of
him
to
let
you
have
the
run
of
his
island
it
has
made
a
most
delightful
playground
and
you
and
the
sea
urchins
will
have
spent
an
ideal
holiday
we
have
indeed
i
so
glad
we
came
to
silversands
i
wish
we
could
come
every
year
and
always
have
the
island
to
play
on
it
would
be
something
to
look
forward
to
through
the
winter
i
afraid
that
is
possible
dear
said
stewart
regretfully
thinking
of
what
might
have
been
if
the
hopes
which
prompted
her
visit
had
been
fulfilled
i
doubt
if
we
shall
ever
return
here
again
but
we
will
have
other
happy
times
together
there
are
many
sweet
spots
in
the
world
where
we
shall
be
able
to
enjoy
ourselves
and
i
have
plans
for
the
future
which
i
will
tell
you
about
i
had
quite
a
jolly
day
in
spite
of
the
rain
declared
isobel
that
evening
when
the
deluge
having
ceased
at
last
the
setting
sun
broke
through
the
thick
banks
of
clouds
and
flooding
the
sea
with
a
golden
glory
brought
out
all
the
visitors
for
an
airing
upon
the
parade
i
have
said
belle
it
was
perfectly
detestable
i
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
except
throw
balls
for
micky
and
even
he
got
tired
of
that
mother
said
we
made
her
head
ache
and
she
went
to
lie
down
never
any
fun
talking
to
barton
she
so
stupid
so
i
sat
and
watched
the
streaming
rain
through
the
window
and
wished
we
never
come
to
silversands
i
think
a
wet
day
in
lodgings
is
just
about
the
horridest
thing
in
the
world
and
i
simply
ca
imagine
how
you
can
have
enjoyed
it
chapter
xv
tea
with
binks
at
many
a
statelier
home
we
had
good
cheer
but
a
kinder
welcome
found
than
here
the
when
finished
was
a
thing
of
beauty
and
isobel
packed
it
up
in
sheets
of
white
tissue
paper
with
much
pride
and
satisfaction
both
the
steaming
teapot
on
the
one
side
and
the
b
on
the
other
had
given
her
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
she
was
not
sorry
that
they
were
completed
going
to
have
tea
with
that
vulgar
old
man
we
met
in
the
train
exclaimed
belle
raising
her
eyebrows
in
astonishment
when
isobel
told
her
of
their
plans
you
really
do
the
things
i
thought
him
dreadful
i
suppose
since
he
asked
you
you
could
get
out
of
it
but
i
sorry
for
you
to
have
to
go
i
should
have
been
able
to
come
to
the
island
in
any
case
because
mother
wants
to
take
me
to
see
the
oppenheims
who
are
they
asked
isobel
oh
they
a
family
mother
knows
in
london
they
ever
so
rich
they
taken
a
lovely
furnished
house
near
the
woods
with
a
and
a
huge
garden
they
to
arrive
this
evening
and
they
bringing
their
motor
car
and
their
chauffeur
with
them
the
wilsons
and
the
bardsleys
are
coming
by
the
same
train
blanche
oppenheim
is
six
months
older
than
i
am
and
mother
says
she
sure
i
shall
like
her
it
will
be
nice
to
have
some
more
friends
here
silversands
is
getting
rather
dull
there
so
little
to
do
in
such
a
quiet
place
there
never
seems
to
be
anything
going
on
isobel
thought
there
had
been
a
great
deal
going
on
of
the
kind
of
fun
she
enjoyed
though
it
might
not
be
altogether
to
belle
taste
and
even
her
friend
depreciation
of
poor
binks
could
not
spoil
the
pleasure
with
which
she
anticipated
her
visit
to
the
white
coppice
she
was
full
of
eagerness
to
start
on
thursday
afternoon
and
was
ready
fully
half
an
hour
too
soon
though
her
mother
assured
her
they
could
not
with
decency
arrive
before
four
the
white
coppice
lay
opposite
to
silversands
at
the
other
side
of
a
narrow
peninsula
and
you
could
either
reach
it
by
going
five
miles
round
by
the
road
or
by
walking
two
miles
across
the
hills
stewart
and
isobel
naturally
preferred
the
short
cut
and
leaving
the
little
town
behind
them
were
soon
on
the
bare
heights
following
a
track
which
led
over
the
moor
it
seemed
land
here
given
up
to
the
grouse
and
plovers
though
now
and
then
they
passed
a
rough
and
once
a
whitewashed
farmstead
the
thatched
roof
of
which
was
bound
down
with
ropes
to
resist
the
autumn
storms
and
the
few
trees
that
sheltered
the
doorway
all
pointing
their
struggling
branches
in
the
same
direction
served
to
show
how
strong
was
the
force
of
the
prevailing
wind
from
the
crest
of
the
hill
they
could
see
the
sea
on
either
hand
and
at
the
far
end
of
the
promontory
could
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
pier
at
ferndale
where
a
steamer
was
landing
its
cargo
of
excursionists
to
swell
the
already
large
crowd
of
cheap
trippers
who
seemed
to
swarm
like
ants
upon
the
shore
i
glad
we
not
staying
there
said
isobel
who
had
been
taken
for
an
afternoon
by
chester
in
company
with
charlie
and
hilda
and
though
she
had
laughed
at
the
niggers
and
the
pierrots
and
enjoyed
watching
the
punch
and
judy
and
the
acrobats
on
the
shore
and
had
put
pennies
into
the
on
the
pier
had
returned
thankfully
from
the
crowded
promenade
and
streets
full
of
to
the
peace
and
quiet
of
silversands
it
rather
amusing
just
for
a
day
but
the
people
are
even
noisier
than
those
we
met
in
the
train
they
were
throwing
confetti
all
about
the
sands
and
shouting
to
one
another
at
the
top
of
their
voices
i
like
a
place
where
we
can
go
walks
and
pick
flowers
and
not
meet
anybody
else
we
should
have
found
a
desert
island
at
ferndale
you
certainly
would
said
stewart
if
holme
were
there
it
would
be
covered
with
swings
and
gingerbeer
stalls
and
your
little
hut
might
probably
have
been
turned
into
an
oyster
room
or
a
penny
show
it
is
delightful
to
find
a
spot
that
is
still
unspoilt
luckily
the
trippers
do
appear
to
go
far
afield
they
seem
quite
content
with
the
attractions
of
the
pier
and
band
and
have
not
yet
invaded
these
beautiful
moors
how
quickly
we
seem
to
have
come
across
we
quite
close
to
the
sea
again
now
and
i
believe
that
gray
old
farmhouse
nestling
among
the
trees
below
will
prove
to
be
the
end
of
our
journey
the
white
coppice
was
so
called
because
it
stood
on
the
borders
of
a
birch
wood
that
lay
in
a
gorge
between
the
hills
it
was
protected
by
a
bold
cliff
from
the
strong
north
and
west
winds
sheltered
by
a
slightly
lower
crag
from
the
east
and
open
only
towards
the
south
where
the
garden
sloped
down
to
a
sandy
cove
and
a
narrow
creek
that
made
a
natural
harbour
for
binks
boat
which
was
generally
moored
to
a
small
jetty
under
the
wall
it
was
an
ancient
stone
farmhouse
with
large
mullioned
windows
and
hospitable
door
over
which
two
tamarisk
bushes
had
been
trained
into
a
rustic
porch
the
garden
was
gay
with
such
hardy
flowers
as
would
flourish
so
near
to
the
sea
growing
in
patches
between
the
rows
of
potatoes
and
beans
and
interspersed
here
and
there
with
the
figureheads
of
vessels
while
at
the
end
was
a
evidently
made
from
an
upturned
boat
and
covered
thickly
with
traveller
joy
here
binks
appeared
to
be
taking
an
afternoon
nap
while
awaiting
the
arrival
of
his
visitors
but
at
the
click
of
the
opening
gate
he
sprang
up
with
a
start
and
advanced
to
meet
them
with
brawny
outstretched
hand
i
reet
glad
to
see
you
i
am
he
exclaimed
cordially
it
royal
weather
too
though
a
trifle
hotter
nor
suits
missis
bawling
through
the
doorway
where
iver
are
you
here
company
come
and
waitin
for
you
binks
could
not
have
been
very
far
away
for
she
bustled
into
the
front
garden
in
a
moment
her
round
rosy
apple
face
smiling
all
over
with
welcome
she
was
a
fine
tall
elderly
woman
so
stout
that
her
figure
reminded
you
of
a
large
soft
pillow
tied
in
the
middle
she
wore
an
black
silk
dress
with
a
white
muslin
apron
and
a
black
netted
cap
with
purple
ribbons
over
her
smoothly
parted
gray
hair
well
now
i
pleased
she
declared
come
in
and
set
you
down
you
be
fair
tired
out
mum
with
your
walk
over
the
moor
havin
had
a
bad
foot
and
all
it
a
nasty
thing
to
strain
your
ankle
it
is
come
in
missy
binks
has
talked
a
deal
about
you
he
has
thinks
you
the
very
moral
of
our
harriet
clara
over
at
skegness
but
bless
you
i
do
see
no
likeness
myself
the
just
on
the
boil
and
you
must
take
a
cup
of
tea
first
thing
to
freshen
you
up
like
it
a
good
step
from
silversands
and
a
bit
close
to
come
so
far
seated
in
a
corner
of
the
oak
settle
isobel
looked
with
eager
curiosity
round
the
old
farm
kitchen
its
flagged
stone
floor
the
sliding
cupboards
in
the
walls
the
great
beams
of
the
ceiling
covered
with
hooks
from
which
were
suspended
flitches
of
bacon
bunches
of
dried
herbs
strings
of
onions
and
even
binks
all
were
new
to
her
interested
gaze
and
her
quick
eyes
took
in
everything
from
the
over
the
dresser
to
the
china
dogs
on
the
the
kitchen
was
so
large
that
half
of
it
seemed
to
be
reserved
as
a
parlour
there
was
a
square
of
carpet
laid
down
at
one
end
upon
which
stood
a
round
table
spread
with
binks
very
best
china
and
a
supply
of
dainties
that
would
have
feasted
a
dozen
visitors
at
least
the
long
low
window
was
filled
with
scarlet
geraniums
between
the
vivid
blossoms
of
which
you
could
catch
a
peep
of
the
cove
and
the
water
beyond
and
just
outside
hung
a
cage
containing
a
pair
of
doves
which
kept
up
an
incessant
cooing
binks
made
quite
a
picture
seated
in
a
tall
elbow
chair
wielding
her
big
teapot
and
she
pressed
her
muffins
and
currant
upon
her
guests
with
true
hospitality
you
ought
to
be
sharp
set
after
a
walk
she
observed
take
it
through
missy
take
it
through
you
must
have
bishop
with
curate
as
we
say
in
these
parts
the
top
piece
is
nought
but
the
poor
curate
for
all
the
butter
runs
to
the
bottom
and
that
the
bishop
is
your
tea
as
you
like
it
you
must
taste
our
apple
jelly
made
of
our
own
crabs
as
grows
in
the
orchard
out
at
back
unless
you
as
lief
try
the
damson
cheese
or
the
strawberry
jam
binks
seemed
much
undecided
whether
his
position
as
host
required
him
to
join
the
party
or
whether
his
presence
in
such
select
company
would
be
an
intrusion
and
in
spite
of
stewart
hope
that
he
would
occupy
his
own
seat
at
the
table
he
finally
compromised
the
matter
by
carrying
his
tea
to
the
opposite
end
of
the
kitchen
and
taking
it
on
the
dresser
from
whence
he
fired
off
remarks
every
now
and
then
whenever
binks
who
was
a
hard
talker
and
monopolized
the
conversation
gave
him
a
chance
to
put
in
a
word
it
was
amusing
talk
isobel
thought
all
about
binks
children
and
grandchildren
and
the
many
illnesses
from
which
they
had
suffered
and
the
medicines
they
had
tried
and
the
wonderful
recoveries
they
had
made
interspersed
by
offers
of
more
tea
and
cake
and
jam
or
lamentations
over
the
small
appetite
of
her
visitors
whom
she
seemed
to
expect
to
clear
the
plates
like
locusts
no
more
missy
why
you
are
soon
done
and
you
have
tasted
my
cranberry
cake
you
must
have
a
bit
of
it
if
you
have
to
put
it
in
your
pocket
it
made
by
a
recipe
as
i
got
from
my
as
lived
up
in
berwick
and
a
light
hand
she
had
too
for
a
cake
laying
a
generous
slice
upon
isobel
plate
and
seeming
quite
hurt
by
her
refusal
you
must
make
her
ill
binks
laughed
stewart
though
she
fully
appreciates
your
isobel
would
you
like
to
open
the
parcel
we
brought
with
us
you
worked
this
for
us
honey
well
i
never
did
cried
binks
touching
the
gorgeous
gingerly
as
if
she
feared
her
stout
fingers
might
soil
its
peter
come
hither
and
look
at
use
it
for
tea
every
day
nay
that
would
be
a
sin
and
a
shame
it
a
sight
too
pretty
to
use
i
put
it
in
the
parlour
alongside
of
the
cup
binks
won
at
last
show
for
the
black
heifer
you
shall
see
for
yourself
missy
how
nice
it
stand
on
the
sideboard
on
top
of
a
daisy
mat
as
harriet
crocheted
when
she
was
down
with
a
bad
leg
binks
opened
a
door
at
the
farther
side
of
the
kitchen
and
proudly
led
the
way
into
her
best
it
was
a
close
little
room
with
a
mouldy
smell
as
if
the
chimney
were
stopped
up
and
the
window
never
opened
one
end
of
it
was
entirely
filled
by
a
mahogany
sideboard
a
large
gilt
mirror
hung
over
the
fireplace
carefully
swathed
in
white
muslin
to
keep
off
the
flies
the
walls
were
adorned
with
photographs
of
the
binks
family
and
its
many
ramifications
taken
in
their
best
clothes
which
did
not
appear
to
sit
easily
upon
them
to
judge
by
the
stiff
unrest
of
their
attitudes
and
opposite
the
door
hung
a
wonderful
german
oleograph
depicting
a
scene
that
might
either
have
been
a
sunrise
on
the
alps
or
an
eruption
of
vesuvius
according
to
the
individual
fancy
of
the
spectator
the
square
table
was
covered
with
a
magenta
cloth
in
the
centre
of
which
stood
a
glass
shade
containing
wax
fruit
while
several
gorgeously
bound
volumes
of
poems
and
sermons
were
placed
at
regular
intervals
each
upon
a
separate
green
mat
it
was
so
hot
and
airless
in
there
that
isobel
was
quite
glad
when
binks
suggested
they
should
adjourn
to
the
garden
that
he
might
show
her
the
figureheads
which
stood
among
the
like
a
row
of
wooden
statues
each
one
was
the
record
of
some
good
ship
gone
to
pieces
upon
that
treacherous
coast
and
as
he
walked
along
pointing
them
out
with
his
stick
the
old
man
gave
the
histories
of
the
wrecks
at
many
of
which
he
had
played
an
active
part
in
saving
the
lives
of
the
crews
that
there
the
her
with
the
broken
nose
smashed
up
like
matchwood
she
was
on
the
cliffs
beyond
ferndale
and
the
captain
drowned
and
the
second
mate
that
there
the
the
gone
but
you
can
see
the
beard
and
the
wreath
she
went
down
of
a
sudden
on
a
sunken
rock
and
never
a
man
left
to
tell
as
how
it
happened
this
un
the
wrecked
outside
silversands
bay
but
we
had
the
lifeboat
out
and
took
all
off
safe
and
this
the
a
coastin
steamer
from
liverpool
as
went
clean
in
two
amongst
them
crags
by
the
lighthouse
and
her
cargo
of
oranges
washed
up
along
the
shore
next
day
till
the
beach
turned
yellow
with
you
know
a
great
deal
about
ships
said
isobel
to
whom
her
reminiscences
were
as
thrilling
as
a
i
should
that
i
been
sailin
for
the
best
part
of
fifty
year
leastways
when
i
was
farmin
i
not
forgot
as
i
promised
to
row
you
over
to
the
balk
if
your
ma
willin
we
best
make
a
start
now
whilst
the
tide
handy
it
worth
your
while
to
go
you
not
see
such
a
sight
again
maybe
in
a
far
day
journey
binks
declined
to
join
the
expedition
so
only
stewart
and
isobel
stepped
into
the
boat
which
binks
rowed
over
the
bay
with
swift
and
steady
strokes
their
destination
was
a
narrow
spit
of
land
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
distant
where
the
crumbling
remains
of
an
old
abbey
rose
gray
among
the
surrounding
rocks
long
years
ago
the
monks
had
fashioned
the
balk
to
catch
their
fish
and
it
still
stood
a
survival
of
ancient
days
and
ancient
ways
close
under
the
ruined
wall
of
the
disused
chapel
it
consisted
of
a
circle
of
stout
oak
staves
driven
into
the
sand
so
as
to
enclose
a
space
of
about
forty
yards
in
diameter
the
staves
being
connected
by
twisted
withes
so
that
the
whole
resembled
a
gigantic
basket
it
was
filled
by
the
high
tide
and
the
retreating
water
running
through
the
meshes
left
the
fish
behind
as
in
a
trap
when
they
were
very
easily
caught
with
the
hands
and
collected
in
creels
you
would
see
more
than
a
couple
like
it
in
all
england
said
binks
they
calls
it
poachin
now
and
no
one
may
make
a
fresh
one
but
this
here
left
and
goes
with
the
white
coppice
and
i
rented
the
two
for
a
matter
of
forty
year
he
drew
up
the
boat
under
the
old
abbey
wall
and
helping
his
guests
to
land
led
them
down
the
beach
to
the
enclosure
where
the
wet
sand
was
covered
with
leaping
shining
fish
some
gasping
their
last
in
the
sunshine
and
some
seeking
the
temporary
shelter
of
a
deeper
pool
in
the
middle
bob
binks
grandson
was
busy
collecting
them
and
putting
them
into
large
baskets
assisted
by
a
clever
little
irish
terrier
which
ran
hither
and
thither
catching
the
fish
in
its
mouth
and
carrying
them
to
its
master
like
a
retriever
much
to
amusement
for
she
had
certainly
never
seen
a
dog
go
fishing
before
it
was
a
pretty
sight
and
a
much
easier
way
isobel
thought
of
earning
your
living
than
venturing
out
with
nets
and
lines
and
she
resolved
to
tell
the
sea
urchins
about
it
so
that
they
might
make
a
small
balk
for
themselves
on
their
desert
island
if
the
colonel
would
allow
them
she
and
her
mother
wandered
round
the
old
abbey
while
binks
was
engaged
in
giving
some
directions
to
bob
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
except
a
few
walls
and
a
fragment
of
what
might
once
have
been
part
of
an
east
window
they
were
lifting
away
the
thick
ivy
which
had
covered
a
corner
stone
when
looking
up
isobel
suddenly
caught
sight
of
a
familiar
figure
coming
towards
them
across
the
rough
broken
flags
of
the
transept
o
mother
she
whispered
it
colonel
smith
and
advancing
rather
shyly
a
step
or
two
she
met
him
with
a
beaming
face
why
it
my
little
friend
again
cried
the
colonel
hunting
for
more
antiquities
i
wish
you
would
find
them
this
is
surely
your
mother
raising
his
hat
your
daughter
will
no
doubt
have
told
you
madam
what
an
interesting
discovery
she
made
on
my
island
i
feel
i
am
very
much
indebted
to
her
she
was
equally
delighted
replied
stewart
she
has
talked
continually
about
this
wonderful
stone
and
its
runic
inscription
i
am
hoping
to
be
able
to
take
a
sketch
of
it
before
we
leave
i
hear
there
is
carving
on
the
lower
portion
as
well
as
the
runes
so
there
is
but
it
half
hidden
by
the
soil
i
taking
some
of
my
men
to
dig
it
out
of
the
ground
and
raise
it
up
and
am
sending
for
a
photographer
to
take
several
views
of
it
it
is
of
special
value
to
me
owing
to
the
particular
norse
dialect
employed
which
is
similar
to
that
on
several
monuments
in
the
isle
of
man
and
shows
that
the
same
race
of
invaders
must
have
swept
across
the
north
and
probably
penetrated
as
far
as
ireland
i
have
seen
runic
crosses
in
ireland
said
stewart
there
a
beautifully
ornamented
one
near
ballymoran
though
the
carving
is
more
like
celtic
than
teutonic
work
those
strange
interlacing
animals
which
you
find
in
ancient
erse
manuscripts
i
am
very
interested
in
old
celtic
remains
and
have
a
good
many
sketches
of
them
at
home
you
could
take
up
a
more
fascinating
study
said
the
colonel
eagerly
it
a
very
wide
field
and
one
that
has
not
been
too
much
explored
i
done
a
little
in
that
way
myself
and
i
am
collecting
materials
for
a
book
on
the
subject
of
celtic
and
runic
crosses
but
it
needs
both
time
and
patience
to
sort
one
knowledge
it
worth
the
trouble
though
for
the
sake
of
the
pleasure
one
gets
out
of
it
i
am
sure
it
is
replied
stewart
with
ready
sympathy
to
love
such
things
is
a
kind
of
part
that
can
not
be
taken
away
from
us
however
much
the
uninitiated
may
laugh
at
our
enthusiasm
you
right
said
the
colonel
we
can
afford
to
let
them
laugh
we
antiquarians
have
the
best
of
it
after
all
i
should
have
liked
to
have
seen
your
picture
of
the
irish
cross
i
wish
i
could
sketch
you
are
fortunate
to
have
that
talent
at
your
disposal
it
a
great
help
in
such
work
and
one
which
i
sadly
lack
why
here
binks
do
you
want
anything
peter
no
sir
answered
binks
touching
his
cap
only
to
say
as
how
the
tide
runnin
out
fast
and
we
ought
to
be
startin
back
now
or
have
to
carry
the
boat
down
the
sands
she
only
in
a
foot
of
water
as
it
is
we
must
indeed
go
said
stewart
consulting
her
watch
it
time
we
were
walking
home
thank
you
turning
to
the
colonel
for
your
kindness
to
my
little
girl
and
her
companions
in
allowing
them
to
play
on
your
island
i
hope
they
are
careful
and
do
no
damage
there
not
in
the
least
there
nothing
to
hurt
madam
it
has
given
me
great
pleasure
to
meet
one
with
whom
i
have
such
a
congenial
subject
in
common
you
must
come
by
all
means
and
sketch
the
stone
and
i
wish
you
every
success
in
your
study
of
both
celtic
and
runic
antiquities
what
an
interesting
old
gentleman
said
stewart
when
having
bid
many
farewells
to
and
binks
she
and
isobel
at
last
turned
their
steps
homeward
over
the
moors
it
was
as
he
said
quite
a
pleasure
to
meet
i
suppose
there
a
freemasonry
between
antiquarians
i
should
like
to
have
a
copy
of
his
book
when
it
published
i
wonder
if
he
would
find
my
sketches
of
the
irish
crosses
useful
i
think
i
must
venture
to
send
them
to
him
when
i
return
home
we
do
know
his
address
but
no
doubt
colonel
smith
silversands
would
find
him
had
a
delightful
afternoon
isobel
and
not
the
least
part
of
it
to
me
has
been
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
your
friend
of
the
desert
island
chapter
xvi
belle
new
friend
how
soon
the
bitter
follows
on
the
sweet
could
i
not
chain
your
fancy
flying
feet
could
i
not
hold
your
soul
to
make
you
play
in
the
key
of
yesterday
isobel
found
belle
on
the
parade
next
morning
in
the
midst
of
quite
a
group
of
fashionable
strangers
she
was
wearing
one
of
her
smartest
frocks
and
was
hanging
affectionately
on
the
arm
of
a
girl
slightly
taller
than
herself
a
child
with
hazel
eyes
and
a
high
colour
dressed
in
a
very
fantastic
costume
of
red
and
white
with
a
scarlet
fez
on
her
thick
frizzy
brown
hair
and
a
tall
cane
ornamented
with
ribbons
in
her
hand
belle
appeared
to
find
her
company
so
entrancing
that
at
first
she
did
not
notice
isobel
and
it
was
only
when
the
latter
spoke
to
her
that
she
seemed
to
realize
her
presence
and
said
we
just
off
to
the
island
said
isobel
charlie
has
got
a
fresh
coil
of
rope
and
the
boys
are
going
to
try
and
make
a
new
raft
the
rokebys
are
bringing
some
eggs
and
we
mean
to
fry
pancakes
and
toss
them
as
if
it
were
shrove
tuesday
are
you
coming
well
not
this
morning
i
think
replied
belle
i
promised
blanche
to
show
her
the
old
town
she
does
know
silversands
at
all
would
she
like
to
go
with
us
to
the
hut
suggested
isobel
looking
towards
the
newcomer
who
stood
playing
with
the
loops
of
ribbon
on
her
cane
and
humming
a
tune
to
herself
in
a
jaunty
manner
oh
i
do
think
so
replied
belle
it
too
far
she
has
seen
the
beach
or
the
quay
yet
we
going
now
to
buy
fruit
in
the
market
and
then
we
shall
have
a
stroll
round
the
shops
you
can
take
micky
with
you
to
the
island
if
you
like
i
put
on
his
leash
so
that
he
follow
me
no
thanks
i
should
be
afraid
of
losing
him
replied
isobel
really
rather
not
shall
i
see
you
this
afternoon
blanche
has
asked
me
to
play
tennis
in
their
garden
said
belle
drawing
isobel
aside
but
i
shall
be
home
about
six
because
the
oppenheims
dine
at
seven
and
blanche
always
has
to
dress
i
come
for
a
walk
then
if
you
call
for
me
i
must
go
now
the
others
are
waiting
isobel
went
away
with
a
rather
blank
feeling
of
disappointment
she
had
grown
so
accustomed
to
belle
that
it
seemed
quite
strange
to
be
without
her
and
the
morning
passed
slowly
in
spite
of
the
pancakes
which
she
helped
letty
and
winnie
to
mix
and
toss
over
the
fire
she
felt
she
was
only
giving
half
her
attention
to
the
raft
that
the
boys
kept
calling
her
to
admire
and
that
her
thoughts
were
continually
with
belle
trying
to
imagine
what
she
was
doing
and
wondering
if
she
were
enjoying
herself
stewart
had
found
the
walk
to
the
white
coppice
such
a
strain
on
her
weak
ankle
that
she
would
not
dare
to
venture
any
great
exertion
for
several
days
so
her
intended
expedition
to
the
island
to
sketch
the
runic
cross
had
perforce
to
be
put
off
she
and
isobel
carried
their
tea
to
the
beach
close
by
that
afternoon
and
drank
it
under
the
shade
of
a
rock
but
though
it
was
pleasant
sitting
close
to
the
lapping
waves
and
stewart
had
brought
a
new
book
to
read
aloud
isobel
mind
would
wander
away
to
the
garden
near
the
woods
where
belle
was
playing
tennis
and
she
would
recall
herself
with
a
start
realizing
that
she
had
not
taken
in
a
single
word
of
the
story
she
went
round
according
to
her
promise
soon
after
six
to
find
stuart
and
her
friend
deep
in
patterns
of
dress
materials
price
lists
catalogues
and
copies
of
the
and
other
newspapers
the
oppenheims
are
giving
a
next
tuesday
explained
belle
they
have
a
great
many
friends
staying
in
the
neighbourhood
who
will
drive
over
they
asked
me
and
i
have
a
thing
fit
to
go
in
my
white
silk
too
short
the
pink
crape
quite
crushed
the
blue
muslin
wo
look
nice
after
it
washed
and
my
merino
hardly
smart
enough
i
must
have
a
new
dress
somehow
i
do
generally
like
you
in
clothes
belle
said
stuart
but
really
this
embroidered
silk
in
the
advertisement
looks
very
pretty
and
peter
robinson
is
a
good
shop
i
think
i
shall
risk
it
there
will
be
just
time
if
i
catch
this
post
would
you
rather
have
the
blue
or
the
pink
the
blue
said
belle
promptly
because
of
my
best
hat
you
better
write
for
some
more
at
the
same
time
the
ones
in
the
front
are
rather
dashed
i
can
wear
my
blue
chain
and
the
turquoise
bracelet
and
i
have
a
pair
of
long
white
gloves
not
touched
yet
but
oh
mother
my
parasol
it
dreadfully
bleached
with
the
sun
do
please
send
for
another
there
a
picture
of
one
here
with
little
frills
all
round
just
what
i
want
belle
mind
was
so
absorbed
by
the
arrangement
of
her
costume
for
the
coming
party
that
until
the
letters
were
written
and
finally
dispatched
to
the
post
she
could
give
no
attention
to
isobel
and
in
the
short
walk
which
they
took
afterwards
on
the
beach
her
whole
conversation
was
of
the
oppenheims
and
the
delightful
afternoon
she
had
spent
at
their
house
blanche
has
five
bracelets
she
confided
and
four
rings
and
a
full
of
lockets
and
chains
and
brooches
she
took
me
upstairs
and
showed
them
to
me
she
brought
her
pony
with
her
and
some
morning
she
promised
to
borrow
her
sister
for
me
and
the
coachman
is
to
take
us
on
to
the
common
to
ride
in
turns
it
be
glorious
she
an
amusing
girl
she
knows
all
the
latest
songs
and
you
should
just
hear
her
take
people
off
it
makes
you
die
with
laughing
she
been
a
year
at
a
jolly
school
near
london
where
the
girls
are
taken
to
at
the
theatre
and
have
a
splendid
time
i
mean
to
ask
mother
to
send
me
there
it
dreadfully
expensive
but
i
know
she
would
mind
that
we
missed
you
at
the
island
said
isobel
the
pancakes
were
delicious
we
ate
them
with
sugar
and
lemons
did
you
said
belle
inattentively
perhaps
i
may
come
if
i
have
time
the
cricket
match
at
the
old
playground
said
isobel
we
always
have
it
on
saturday
you
know
had
you
forgotten
i
suppose
i
had
replied
belle
i
bring
blanche
if
she
cares
about
coming
i
do
know
whether
she
plays
cricket
on
saturday
morning
isobel
called
early
at
no
only
to
find
that
belle
had
already
gone
to
the
oppenheims
and
would
not
return
until
lunch
i
sorry
she
not
in
dear
said
stuart
kindly
noticing
isobel
look
of
disappointment
but
she
expects
to
see
you
in
the
afternoon
i
sure
she
told
me
she
would
be
meeting
all
her
friends
upon
the
shore
so
some
of
the
others
will
no
doubt
know
what
has
been
arranged
if
you
ask
them
i
believe
i
saw
the
rokebys
pass
a
moment
ago
you
could
soon
overtake
them
if
you
were
to
run
the
matches
on
the
small
green
common
which
had
been
their
first
playground
were
still
an
institution
of
the
sea
urchins
club
and
isobel
looked
forward
to
them
with
considerable
pleasure
she
had
not
sufficient
strength
of
arm
to
gain
credit
as
a
batsman
but
she
was
a
splendid
fielder
and
charlie
declared
that
no
one
made
a
better
this
afternoon
both
boys
and
girls
had
assembled
in
full
force
punctually
at
the
appointed
time
and
the
game
was
nearly
halfway
through
before
belle
and
her
new
friend
came
sauntering
leisurely
up
to
the
pitch
oh
we
do
want
to
play
thank
you
said
belle
only
to
look
on
please
do
stop
on
our
account
we
just
going
to
sit
down
and
watch
you
the
pair
retired
to
the
old
boat
where
they
settled
themselves
under
the
shade
of
blanche
parasol
and
to
judge
from
their
giggling
mirth
found
great
entertainment
in
making
merry
at
the
expense
of
the
others
isobel
who
was
fielding
had
not
a
chance
to
speak
to
belle
until
the
opposite
side
was
out
but
arthur
wright
having
sent
a
catch
at
last
she
was
free
until
her
own
innings
she
ran
up
with
her
accustomed
eagerness
expecting
her
friend
to
kiss
her
as
usual
and
to
make
room
for
her
upon
the
boat
however
belle
did
nothing
of
the
sort
that
you
isobel
she
said
carelessly
i
should
think
you
hot
i
do
know
how
you
can
tear
about
so
blanche
said
your
legs
looked
like
a
pair
of
compasses
when
you
flew
after
the
ball
are
you
going
to
play
asked
isobel
we
want
one
more
on
each
side
no
thanks
i
hate
racing
up
and
down
in
the
sun
it
takes
one
hair
out
of
curl
oh
i
do
think
it
would
replied
isobel
people
with
rats
tails
ca
judge
said
blanche
twisting
one
of
belle
light
locks
and
her
own
dark
ones
together
as
she
spoke
and
looking
at
the
combination
with
a
critical
eye
if
my
brother
were
here
he
be
in
fits
over
this
cricket
i
never
saw
such
a
game
that
big
boy
holds
his
bat
in
the
most
clumsy
way
he
a
very
good
player
said
isobel
he
gets
more
runs
than
anybody
else
and
it
terribly
hard
to
put
him
out
jermyn
would
bowl
him
first
ball
returned
blanche
scornfully
perhaps
you
never
seen
eton
boys
play
i
always
go
to
lord
to
watch
the
match
with
harrow
it
as
different
from
this
as
a
theatre
is
from
a
troupe
of
niggers
why
but
this
is
only
a
children
mixed
team
said
isobel
of
course
some
of
the
little
ones
scarcely
know
how
to
play
at
all
we
just
send
them
very
easy
balls
and
let
them
you
surely
not
going
belle
tea
will
be
ready
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
rokeby
boiling
the
kettle
on
a
spirit
lamp
over
by
the
rocks
we
do
want
any
thank
you
said
belle
rising
from
the
boat
and
brushing
some
sand
off
her
dress
oppenheim
is
going
to
take
us
to
tea
at
the
new
café
i
hear
they
capital
ices
and
a
band
the
wilsons
were
telling
me
about
it
yesterday
they
say
you
meet
everybody
there
from
four
to
five
shall
i
see
you
on
the
parade
this
evening
called
isobel
as
belle
strolled
away
in
the
direction
of
silversands
her
arm
closely
locked
in
blanche
i
do
think
so
replied
belle
without
turning
her
head
and
saying
something
in
a
whisper
to
blanche
which
evidently
caused
the
latter
much
amusement
for
she
broke
into
a
suppressed
peal
of
laughter
and
glancing
round
at
isobel
went
along
shaking
her
shoulders
with
mirth
isobel
stood
looking
after
the
retreating
couple
with
a
lump
in
her
throat
and
a
curious
sick
sensation
in
her
heart
she
could
not
yet
quite
realize
that
belle
did
not
desire
her
companionship
only
that
somehow
blanche
had
carried
off
her
friend
and
that
everything
was
completely
spoilt
between
blanche
and
herself
she
recognized
there
was
an
instinctive
hostility
blanche
had
been
so
openly
rude
and
had
treated
both
her
and
the
sea
urchins
with
such
evident
contempt
that
isobel
not
usually
a
quarrelsome
child
had
felt
all
her
spirit
rise
up
within
her
in
passionate
indignation
why
does
she
come
here
to
make
fun
of
us
she
asked
herself
hotly
we
had
such
jolly
times
before
none
of
the
others
were
ever
nasty
like
this
not
even
aggie
wright
or
hugh
rokeby
why
ca
she
keep
with
her
own
family
and
why
oh
why
does
belle
seem
to
like
her
so
much
next
day
being
sunday
isobel
only
saw
her
friend
at
a
distance
in
church
stewart
who
had
a
suspicion
of
what
was
happening
suggesting
that
they
should
pass
the
afternoon
with
their
books
on
the
cliffs
thinking
it
would
be
better
to
leave
belle
severely
alone
and
give
no
opportunity
for
a
meeting
on
this
account
she
spent
monday
in
ferndale
asking
hilda
chester
to
accompany
them
and
taking
the
two
children
to
hear
the
band
play
on
the
pier
and
to
an
entertainment
afterwards
in
the
pavilion
the
rokebys
came
on
tuesday
morning
inviting
isobel
to
join
them
in
a
boating
excursion
from
which
they
did
not
return
until
late
in
the
evening
so
that
for
the
first
time
since
the
beginning
of
their
acquaintance
the
namesakes
had
not
spoken
to
each
other
for
three
whole
days
isobel
had
borne
the
separation
as
well
as
she
could
but
she
longed
to
see
belle
again
with
the
full
force
of
her
loving
nature
she
invented
many
excuses
for
the
conduct
of
the
latter
who
she
thought
was
no
doubt
regretting
her
coldness
and
would
be
as
delighted
as
ever
to
meet
if
only
she
could
get
belle
to
herself
without
blanche
all
would
surely
be
right
between
them
and
the
friendship
as
warm
as
it
had
been
before
may
i
ask
her
to
tea
mother
she
begged
with
so
wistful
a
look
in
her
gray
eyes
and
such
a
suspicious
little
quiver
at
the
corners
of
her
mouth
that
stewart
consented
somewhat
against
her
better
judgment
finding
belle
on
the
next
morning
isobel
broached
the
subject
of
the
invitation
at
once
said
belle
i
going
to
the
oppenheims
i
have
told
you
yet
about
their
it
was
a
swell
affair
they
had
waiters
from
the
belle
vue
hotel
at
ferndale
and
the
grenadier
band
from
the
pier
i
never
saw
lovelier
dresses
in
my
life
my
blue
silk
came
just
in
time
and
it
really
looked
very
nice
and
the
parasol
is
sweet
you
ca
think
how
much
i
enjoyed
myself
would
do
suggested
isobel
if
you
ca
come
to
tea
at
your
lodgings
replied
belle
with
a
rather
blank
expression
on
her
face
yes
unless
we
carry
the
cups
out
on
to
the
shore
and
have
a
picnic
perhaps
that
would
be
nicer
mother
wants
to
take
me
to
call
on
the
wilsons
then
friday
or
saturday
it
does
matter
which
to
us
really
said
belle
looking
rather
embarrassed
i
expect
i
shall
be
going
to
the
oppenheims
both
days
blanche
likes
me
to
make
up
the
set
at
tennis
and
it
so
cool
and
nice
in
the
garden
under
the
trees
there
she
is
now
coming
along
the
beach
and
beckoning
to
me
i
wonder
what
she
wants
i
think
i
shall
have
to
go
and
see
and
belle
ran
quickly
off
as
if
glad
to
find
an
excuse
for
getting
away
and
meeting
the
oppenheims
she
turned
back
with
them
towards
the
parade
left
alone
isobel
felt
as
though
some
great
shock
had
passed
over
her
she
saw
only
too
plainly
that
belle
did
not
want
to
come
did
not
care
for
her
society
or
value
her
friendship
and
the
bitterness
of
the
knowledge
seemed
almost
greater
than
she
could
bear
she
walked
slowly
to
the
cliff
and
climbing
part
of
the
way
up
sat
down
in
a
sheltered
nook
hidden
from
sight
of
the
beach
then
putting
her
head
on
her
hands
she
let
loose
the
of
her
grief
god
help
us
when
we
first
find
out
that
those
we
care
for
no
longer
respond
to
our
love
the
wound
may
heal
but
it
leaves
a
scar
and
remains
one
of
those
silent
milestones
of
the
soul
to
which
we
look
back
in
after
years
as
having
marked
an
epoch
in
our
inner
lives
at
the
time
it
appears
as
if
all
our
affection
had
been
wasted
but
it
is
not
so
for
the
very
fact
of
loving
even
an
unworthy
object
increases
our
power
to
love
and
enlarges
the
heart
lifting
us
above
self
and
as
bread
cast
upon
the
waters
will
return
to
us
after
many
days
in
a
greater
capacity
for
sympathy
with
others
and
a
widening
of
our
spiritual
growth
to
isobel
it
seemed
as
if
the
whole
world
had
somehow
changed
she
had
had
few
companions
of
her
own
age
and
this
was
her
first
essay
at
friendship
those
who
enjoy
very
keenly
suffer
alas
in
like
proportion
and
hers
was
not
a
disposition
to
take
things
lightly
she
stayed
for
a
long
long
time
upon
the
cliffs
fighting
a
hard
battle
before
she
could
get
her
tears
under
sufficient
control
to
walk
home
along
the
shore
as
she
did
not
care
to
face
any
of
the
sea
urchins
with
streaming
eyes
perhaps
a
touch
of
pride
came
to
her
aid
she
would
at
any
rate
not
let
belle
know
how
greatly
she
cared
and
when
they
met
again
she
would
behave
as
if
she
too
were
not
anxious
about
the
acquaintance
so
much
she
felt
she
owed
to
her
own
and
she
meant
to
carry
it
out
whatever
it
cost
her
i
would
break
my
heart
darling
said
stewart
who
seeing
isobel
red
eyes
soon
discovered
the
trouble
and
offered
what
comfort
she
could
belle
is
worth
grieving
for
i
was
afraid
of
this
from
the
first
but
you
were
so
taken
with
her
that
it
seemed
of
no
use
to
warn
you
i
do
think
she
was
ever
half
what
you
believed
her
to
be
and
she
has
proved
herself
a
very
fickle
friend
never
mind
we
shall
be
going
home
soon
and
you
will
have
other
interests
to
turn
your
thoughts
we
shall
see
little
more
of
her
at
silversands
and
the
best
thing
we
can
do
is
to
forget
her
as
speedily
as
we
can
chapter
xvii
the
chase
tones
that
i
once
used
to
know
thrill
in
those
accents
of
thine
eyes
that
i
loved
long
ago
gaze
your
lashes
at
mine
except
by
isobel
belle
was
scarcely
missed
at
the
desert
island
where
the
sea
urchins
had
so
many
interesting
schemes
on
hand
that
they
did
not
trouble
to
spare
a
thought
to
one
who
had
not
taken
the
pains
to
make
herself
a
general
favourite
for
the
last
few
days
all
the
children
had
been
absorbed
in
the
construction
of
another
hut
upon
the
opposite
end
of
the
island
it
was
built
with
loose
stones
after
the
fashion
of
an
irish
cabin
and
they
intended
to
roof
it
when
it
was
finished
with
planks
covered
with
pieces
of
turf
this
new
building
was
to
surpass
even
the
old
one
in
beauty
and
ingenuity
it
was
to
consist
of
several
rooms
and
both
boys
and
girls
toiled
away
at
it
with
an
ardour
which
would
have
caused
the
ordinary
british
workman
to
open
his
eyes
in
amazement
isobel
worked
as
hard
as
any
one
carrying
stones
and
mixing
a
crumbly
kind
of
mortar
made
out
of
sand
and
crushed
limpets
which
charlie
fondly
imagined
would
resemble
the
famous
cement
with
which
mediæval
castles
were
built
and
would
defy
the
combined
effects
of
time
and
weather
since
belle
desertion
she
had
been
much
with
the
chesters
hilda
though
several
years
younger
than
herself
was
a
dear
little
companion
and
charlie
was
a
staunch
friend
standing
up
for
her
when
necessary
against
the
rokeby
boys
whose
teasing
was
sometimes
apt
to
get
beyond
all
bounds
of
endurance
on
the
following
friday
the
whole
party
were
busy
upon
the
shore
collecting
a
fresh
supply
of
for
their
architecture
when
isobel
who
had
left
the
others
that
she
might
carry
her
load
of
periwinkles
to
the
already
large
heap
under
the
rocks
spied
her
friend
the
colonel
in
the
distance
and
flinging
down
her
basket
hurried
along
the
beach
to
greet
him
well
met
miss
robinson
crusoe
cried
the
colonel
i
was
just
on
the
point
of
going
up
the
cliff
to
take
another
look
at
the
old
stone
like
a
child
with
a
new
toy
i
find
i
ca
tear
myself
away
from
it
and
i
want
to
keep
going
back
to
read
the
runes
again
and
to
see
that
it
is
safe
and
uninjured
will
you
come
with
me
to
keep
me
company
isobel
was
nothing
loath
she
much
enjoyed
a
chat
with
the
owner
of
the
island
and
they
sat
for
a
long
time
on
a
large
boulder
near
the
cross
while
he
wrote
the
runic
alphabet
for
her
on
a
leaf
torn
from
his
now
i
should
at
least
be
able
to
make
out
the
words
of
another
inscription
if
i
found
it
she
said
triumphantly
even
if
i
know
what
it
meant
i
shall
copy
these
and
then
write
my
name
in
runes
inside
all
my
books
i
think
they
ever
so
much
prettier
than
modern
letters
with
the
slight
disadvantage
that
very
few
people
can
decipher
them
laughed
the
colonel
you
might
as
well
sign
your
autograph
in
sanscrit
how
fast
the
tide
is
rising
i
think
we
should
warn
your
playfellows
that
they
ought
to
be
running
home
i
always
afraid
lest
they
should
be
caught
on
these
sands
he
rose
as
he
spoke
and
walked
to
the
verge
of
the
cliff
where
he
could
command
a
view
of
the
shore
below
just
in
time
to
see
the
last
of
the
children
hustled
by
charlotte
wright
whose
sensible
practical
head
never
forgot
the
state
of
the
tide
up
the
beach
at
the
silversands
side
of
the
channel
which
was
already
beginning
to
fill
so
quickly
as
to
render
any
further
crossing
impossible
oh
look
what
shall
we
do
cried
isobel
in
some
alarm
we
quite
cut
off
we
ca
possibly
get
through
that
deep
water
even
if
we
try
to
wade
we
shall
have
to
stay
on
the
island
all
night
and
sleep
in
the
hut
like
true
pioneers
said
the
colonel
it
would
certainly
be
a
new
experience
no
little
miss
crusoe
i
do
think
we
are
driven
to
such
a
desperate
extremity
as
that
yet
i
left
my
boat
at
the
other
side
of
the
headland
and
my
man
is
only
waiting
my
signal
to
row
round
i
will
take
you
across
with
me
to
the
chase
and
land
you
in
safety
mounting
to
the
top
of
the
hill
he
waved
his
handkerchief
and
a
small
which
had
been
anchored
in
the
bay
put
off
immediately
in
their
direction
it
not
nearly
so
romantic
as
if
we
had
been
obliged
to
spend
a
lonely
night
shivering
in
the
hut
said
the
colonel
we
missed
rather
an
interesting
adventure
but
it
much
more
comfortable
after
all
will
your
mother
feel
anxious
if
she
sees
the
other
children
return
without
you
she
gone
to
ferndale
this
afternoon
to
buy
some
more
paints
and
drawing
paper
replied
isobel
you
ca
get
sketching
materials
in
silversands
she
wo
be
home
until
seven
because
there
a
train
earlier
i
shall
have
to
take
tea
alone
better
have
it
with
me
suggested
her
friend
i
feel
i
owe
some
return
for
the
hospitality
you
exercised
in
the
hut
i
have
forgotten
the
nice
cup
of
tea
you
made
you
must
see
my
flowers
and
i
can
send
you
home
afterwards
in
the
that
be
nice
cried
isobel
her
joy
at
the
prospect
showing
itself
in
her
beaming
face
we
saw
your
garden
from
the
top
of
the
scar
that
day
we
went
into
your
grounds
and
i
thought
it
looked
well
i
believe
i
have
as
good
a
show
as
most
people
in
the
neighbourhood
admitted
the
colonel
but
you
shall
judge
for
yourself
here
we
are
at
the
take
care
give
me
your
hand
and
i
will
help
you
out
the
chase
appeared
to
have
a
private
wooden
jetty
of
its
own
which
led
on
to
a
strip
of
shingly
beach
at
the
other
side
of
which
an
iron
gate
admitted
them
into
a
small
plantation
of
fir
trees
and
through
a
shrubbery
into
the
garden
isobel
could
not
restrain
a
cry
of
pleasure
at
the
sight
of
the
flowers
which
were
now
in
the
prime
of
their
early
autumn
glory
and
she
did
not
know
whether
to
admire
more
the
little
beds
gay
with
bright
blossoms
which
dotted
the
smoothly
mown
lawns
or
the
splendid
herbaceous
borders
behind
full
of
dahlias
sunflowers
gladioli
hollyhocks
torch
lilies
tall
and
other
beautiful
plants
i
must
show
you
all
my
treasures
said
the
colonel
pleased
with
her
appreciation
as
he
took
her
to
the
pond
where
the
pink
grew
and
the
bamboo
and
eucalyptus
were
flourishing
in
the
open
air
you
do
often
find
subtropical
plants
so
far
north
he
explained
with
a
touch
of
pride
as
he
pointed
them
out
but
this
is
a
very
sheltered
situation
and
we
protect
them
with
matting
during
the
winter
you
should
see
the
irises
in
the
spring
and
early
summer
they
are
a
mass
of
delicate
colour
and
thrive
so
well
down
by
the
water
edge
the
rock
garden
with
its
pretty
alpine
blossoms
the
rosery
where
the
queen
of
flowers
seemed
represented
by
every
variety
from
the
delicate
yellow
of
the
tea
to
the
rich
red
of
the
damask
the
fountain
where
the
water
flowed
from
the
pouting
lips
of
a
chubby
cherub
astride
on
a
dolphin
into
a
basin
filled
with
gold
and
silver
fish
the
terraced
walk
covered
by
a
fine
magnolia
and
the
on
the
wall
containing
a
fixed
telescope
through
which
you
could
look
out
over
the
sea
all
were
an
equal
delight
to
isobel
wondering
eyes
for
she
had
never
before
been
in
such
beautiful
grounds
nor
was
the
less
of
a
surprise
with
its
peaches
and
apricots
hanging
on
the
red
brick
walls
carefully
netted
to
preserve
them
from
the
birds
its
beds
of
tall
feathery
asparagus
and
its
ripe
greengages
and
early
apples
the
trim
neatness
of
the
vegetable
borders
was
enlivened
by
edgings
of
hardy
annuals
and
here
and
there
a
mass
of
sweet
peas
filled
the
air
with
a
delicious
fragrance
while
in
a
corner
stood
a
row
of
the
buzzing
occupants
of
which
seemed
busily
at
work
among
the
scarlet
runners
isobel
thought
no
enchanted
palace
could
rival
the
greenhouses
gay
with
geraniums
and
fuchsias
and
rare
plants
the
names
of
which
she
did
not
know
or
the
vinery
with
its
countless
bunches
of
black
grapes
hanging
from
the
roof
it
was
so
particularly
nice
to
be
taken
round
by
the
owner
who
could
pluck
the
flowers
and
fruit
as
he
wished
and
so
different
from
the
park
at
home
which
was
her
usual
playground
where
you
might
not
walk
on
the
grass
and
hardly
dared
to
admire
the
flowers
for
fear
the
policeman
should
suspect
you
of
wanting
to
touch
them
you
will
be
quite
tired
now
and
hungry
too
i
expect
said
her
host
as
he
led
the
way
on
to
a
long
veranda
in
front
of
the
house
where
two
chairs
and
a
round
table
spread
for
tea
were
awaiting
them
i
must
show
you
my
horses
and
dogs
afterwards
i
have
five
little
collie
pups
which
i
am
sure
you
will
like
to
see
and
a
brown
foal
only
a
fortnight
old
my
coachman
has
some
pigeons
too
and
a
hutch
of
rabbits
it
seemed
very
strange
to
isobel
to
find
herself
sitting
in
the
comfortable
talking
to
the
colonel
while
he
poured
the
tea
from
the
silver
teapot
into
the
pretty
painted
cups
she
could
scarcely
believe
that
only
three
weeks
ago
she
had
trespassed
in
his
grounds
and
had
almost
expected
him
to
send
her
to
prison
for
the
offence
while
now
she
was
chatting
to
him
as
freely
as
if
she
had
known
him
all
her
life
that
her
holland
frock
was
not
improved
by
an
afternoon
play
on
the
island
that
her
sand
shoes
were
the
worse
for
wear
and
her
sailor
hat
was
her
oldest
and
that
the
wind
had
blown
her
long
hair
into
elf
locks
did
not
distress
her
in
the
least
though
i
fear
stewart
would
hardly
have
considered
her
in
visiting
order
certainly
the
colonel
did
not
seem
to
mind
and
whatever
he
may
have
thought
of
the
appearance
of
his
young
guest
her
good
manners
and
refined
accent
had
shown
him
from
the
first
that
she
was
the
child
of
cultured
people
mother
means
to
sketch
the
runic
cross
on
monday
volunteered
isobel
as
the
talk
turned
on
the
subject
of
the
island
she
went
to
ferndale
on
purpose
to
buy
a
new
block
her
old
one
was
too
small
and
not
the
right
shape
i
shall
hope
to
see
her
picture
replied
the
colonel
i
must
show
you
the
photos
of
the
stone
which
arrived
this
morning
they
are
in
my
study
so
if
you
really
wo
have
any
more
tea
we
will
come
indoors
and
look
at
them
now
he
led
the
way
through
an
open
french
window
into
a
large
and
pleasant
which
appeared
so
filled
with
beautiful
cabinets
of
curiosities
old
china
rare
pictures
and
books
that
isobel
would
have
liked
to
linger
and
look
at
them
if
she
had
dared
to
ask
but
the
colonel
strode
on
into
the
panelled
hall
and
passing
the
wide
staircase
with
its
carved
balustrade
and
its
statue
of
hebe
holding
a
lamp
at
the
foot
took
her
into
a
long
low
library
at
the
farther
side
of
the
house
it
was
a
cosy
room
its
four
windows
overlooked
the
rose
garden
and
had
a
peep
of
the
cliffs
and
the
sea
a
large
strewn
with
papers
stood
in
a
recess
and
various
padded
morocco
seemed
to
invite
one
to
sit
down
and
read
the
books
which
almost
covered
the
walls
from
floor
to
ceiling
over
the
fine
stone
hung
two
portraits
the
only
pictures
to
be
seen
one
an
enlarged
photograph
of
a
handsome
young
officer
in
a
guards
uniform
the
other
a
small
oil
painting
of
a
little
girl
with
gray
eyes
and
straight
fair
hair
parted
smoothly
in
the
middle
of
her
forehead
and
tied
by
a
ribbon
under
her
ears
i
only
received
the
prints
this
morning
said
the
colonel
taking
an
envelope
from
his
desk
there
are
four
views
altogether
as
you
will
see
but
i
think
you
will
like
this
the
best
for
it
shows
the
runes
so
plainly
he
held
out
the
photo
of
the
ancient
cross
but
isobel
did
not
notice
it
she
was
standing
with
parted
lips
her
eyes
fixed
in
amazement
upon
the
two
portraits
over
the
fireplace
why
she
cried
in
an
eager
voice
that
father
my
father
your
father
my
dear
said
the
colonel
astonished
in
his
turn
impossible
this
is
a
portrait
of
my
son
but
it
father
returned
isobel
it
the
same
photo
which
we
have
at
home
only
larger
that
the
he
won
in
india
and
his
guards
uniform
and
the
other
picture
is
little
aunt
isobel
what
do
you
mean
asked
the
colonel
hastily
how
could
it
be
your
aunt
isobel
i
do
know
but
it
replied
isobel
i
have
a
tiny
painting
exactly
like
it
done
on
ivory
inside
a
morocco
case
it
belonged
to
father
and
he
left
it
to
me
she
was
his
only
sister
and
she
died
when
she
was
eleven
years
old
just
the
same
age
as
i
am
for
answer
the
colonel
took
isobel
by
the
shoulders
and
holding
her
beneath
the
portrait
looked
narrowly
at
her
face
the
evening
sunshine
flooding
through
the
window
fell
on
the
fair
hair
and
lighted
it
up
with
the
same
golden
gleam
as
that
of
the
child
in
the
picture
above
the
gray
eyes
of
both
seemed
to
meet
him
with
the
same
gaze
the
likeness
is
extraordinary
he
murmured
i
wonder
i
have
never
noticed
it
before
is
it
possible
i
could
have
made
so
great
a
mistake
in
what
regiment
was
your
father
he
was
in
the
fifth
dragoon
guards
you
have
told
me
he
is
dead
yes
he
was
killed
in
the
boer
war
how
long
ago
six
years
on
my
birthday
was
it
near
bloemfontein
yes
in
a
night
skirmish
he
is
buried
there
just
where
he
fell
had
he
any
other
relations
besides
yourself
and
your
mother
only
my
grandfather
whom
i
have
never
seen
and
your
name
your
name
cried
the
colonel
white
to
the
lips
with
an
emotion
he
could
not
control
isobel
stewart
chapter
xviii
we
say
it
for
an
hour
or
for
years
we
say
it
smiling
say
it
choked
with
tears
we
say
it
coldly
say
it
with
a
kiss
and
yet
we
have
no
other
word
than
this
colonel
stewart
very
natural
mistake
in
confusing
the
namesakes
and
isobel
equal
error
in
believing
her
grandfather
to
be
colonel
smith
were
soon
explained
the
former
full
of
relief
at
this
unexpected
turn
of
affairs
paid
a
visit
to
marine
terrace
that
same
evening
and
in
the
interview
with
his
which
followed
he
begged
her
pardon
frankly
and
freely
for
his
prejudice
and
injustice
it
seems
late
in
life
for
a
old
man
to
turn
over
a
new
leaf
he
said
but
if
you
can
overlook
my
misconception
and
neglect
of
you
in
the
past
i
trust
we
may
prove
firm
friends
in
the
future
and
as
for
isobel
she
is
a
granddaughter
after
my
own
heart
will
you
forget
that
miserable
letter
which
i
wrote
it
was
intended
not
for
you
as
i
know
you
now
but
for
the
mother
of
that
other
child
and
show
your
forgiveness
by
coming
to
cheer
my
loneliness
at
the
chase
now
that
we
understand
each
other
i
think
we
need
have
no
fear
of
disagreements
and
our
mutual
love
for
the
one
who
is
gone
and
the
other
who
is
left
will
make
a
bond
of
sympathy
between
us
isobel
joyful
astonishment
may
be
pictured
when
she
discovered
that
her
friend
of
the
island
was
in
very
truth
her
own
grandfather
and
her
happiness
when
she
and
her
mother
removed
the
next
week
from
marine
terrace
to
the
chase
can
scarcely
be
described
it
just
like
a
fairy
tale
she
declared
i
never
thought
when
i
sat
on
the
top
of
the
scar
that
afternoon
looking
down
at
the
lovely
house
and
garden
and
saying
what
i
would
do
if
i
lived
there
that
it
could
ever
really
come
to
pass
it
almost
too
good
to
be
true
and
i
should
be
in
the
least
surprised
if
it
were
only
a
dream
after
all
it
soon
proved
to
be
no
dream
but
a
most
satisfactory
reality
when
she
saw
herself
installed
as
her
grandfather
favourite
companion
in
the
very
surroundings
which
she
had
so
much
admired
to
colonel
stewart
she
filled
the
vacant
place
of
the
little
daughter
he
had
lost
in
former
years
and
so
keen
was
his
pleasure
in
his
grandchild
that
if
isobel
had
not
been
of
a
thoroughly
sensible
nature
i
fear
she
would
have
run
a
very
great
risk
of
becoming
completely
spoilt
her
influence
and
her
own
naturally
unselfish
disposition
saved
her
from
that
however
and
the
wholesome
discipline
of
school
life
afterwards
taught
her
to
be
able
to
take
her
grandfather
kindness
without
acquiring
an
undue
idea
of
her
own
importance
she
was
very
happy
at
the
chase
and
especially
delighted
when
colonel
stewart
made
her
a
formal
present
of
the
desert
island
it
shall
be
yours
to
do
what
you
like
with
he
declared
i
promised
to
lease
it
to
you
when
you
found
the
runic
cross
and
i
think
you
deserve
to
have
it
for
your
own
it
shall
be
one
of
my
presents
to
you
on
your
eleventh
birthday
that
happy
event
was
to
take
place
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
and
to
celebrate
the
occasion
all
the
sea
urchins
had
been
invited
to
a
garden
at
the
chase
as
a
winding
up
of
the
club
before
the
various
children
left
silversands
for
it
was
september
now
governesses
were
returning
schools
were
reopening
and
the
holidays
were
over
at
last
it
was
a
lovely
autumn
morning
when
isobel
with
a
bright
birthday
face
looked
out
of
the
open
window
of
her
pretty
bedroom
to
see
her
island
shining
in
the
early
sunshine
against
the
sea
and
the
shadows
falling
over
the
lawns
and
gardens
of
the
beautiful
spot
which
was
now
her
home
i
the
luckiest
girl
in
the
world
she
thought
as
she
ran
down
to
the
breakfast
table
to
find
her
plate
filled
with
packages
and
the
prettiest
white
pony
waiting
for
her
outside
the
front
steps
with
a
new
quite
ready
for
her
to
learn
to
ride
i
want
you
to
be
a
good
horsewoman
said
the
colonel
i
think
you
are
plucky
enough
and
when
you
had
a
little
practice
i
hope
you
soon
enjoy
a
canter
with
me
across
the
moors
the
skye
terrier
i
spoke
of
will
be
coming
next
week
i
had
to
send
to
scotland
for
him
so
he
could
not
arrive
in
time
for
your
birthday
but
you
will
be
able
to
make
his
acquaintance
later
to
have
a
pony
of
her
very
own
had
always
been
one
of
isobel
castles
in
the
air
and
she
spent
the
morning
trying
her
new
favourite
in
a
state
of
rapture
that
was
only
equalled
by
her
joy
at
receiving
her
friends
in
the
afternoon
all
the
sea
urchins
were
there
from
tall
hugh
rokeby
to
the
youngest
wright
and
though
they
seemed
somewhat
shy
and
on
their
best
behaviour
at
first
their
restraint
soon
wore
off
at
the
sight
of
the
splendid
cricket
pitch
the
archery
and
the
other
games
which
the
colonel
had
prepared
for
them
after
some
hesitation
it
had
been
decided
to
include
belle
in
the
invitation
and
she
appeared
with
the
others
dressed
in
one
of
her
daintiest
costumes
and
her
most
becoming
hat
not
in
the
least
abashed
by
any
remembrance
of
her
former
behaviour
so
you
really
living
at
this
splendid
place
darling
she
cried
clasping
isobel
arm
close
in
hers
with
quite
her
old
clinging
manner
it
so
much
nicer
than
the
oppenheims
and
i
suppose
it
will
all
be
yours
some
day
wo
it
the
pony
is
simply
a
beauty
i
delighted
to
come
this
afternoon
somehow
i
have
seemed
to
see
very
much
of
you
lately
though
i
do
think
it
has
been
my
fault
you
always
were
my
dearest
friend
and
always
will
be
i
am
pleased
to
see
all
my
friends
here
replied
isobel
quietly
then
very
gently
she
drew
her
arm
away
she
knew
belle
affection
now
for
what
it
was
worth
the
old
love
for
her
had
died
that
day
on
the
cliff
and
however
much
she
might
regret
the
loss
nothing
could
ever
bring
it
back
to
her
again
other
and
truer
friendships
might
follow
but
this
was
as
utterly
gone
as
a
beautiful
iridescent
bubble
when
it
has
burst
it
was
the
first
time
that
the
rokebys
had
met
colonel
stewart
since
they
had
uprooted
his
cherished
maidenhair
and
with
a
good
deal
of
blushing
and
poking
at
each
other
they
blurted
out
an
apology
for
their
conduct
on
that
occasion
we
wo
speak
of
it
said
the
colonel
you
would
do
it
again
sure
nor
shirk
the
matter
afterwards
certainly
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
you
vanished
like
the
wind
and
i
shall
expect
to
have
a
wonderful
exhibition
of
such
running
capabilities
on
the
it
an
excellent
pitch
and
if
you
do
make
a
record
i
shall
be
surprised
with
both
charlie
and
hilda
chester
he
was
more
than
pleased
and
hoped
they
might
be
frequent
visitors
at
the
chase
if
they
returned
to
silversands
while
he
extended
a
hearty
and
kindly
welcome
to
all
the
young
guests
who
echoed
bertie
rokeby
opinion
that
it
was
the
most
ripping
party
that
ever
was
given
the
first
half
of
the
afternoon
was
devoted
to
cricket
which
i
really
believe
the
colonel
enjoyed
as
much
as
his
visitors
it
recalled
his
old
school
days
and
he
had
many
a
tale
to
tell
of
matches
played
fifty
years
ago
on
the
fields
at
eton
by
boys
who
had
since
made
their
mark
in
life
tea
was
served
in
the
large
which
looked
cool
with
the
light
falling
through
the
window
at
the
end
on
to
the
white
marble
statues
which
stood
in
recesses
along
the
walls
it
was
a
real
jolly
tea
not
one
of
those
affairs
where
you
get
nothing
but
a
cucumber
sandwich
and
a
square
inch
of
cake
and
have
to
stand
about
and
wait
on
the
girls
as
bertie
rokeby
ungallantly
observed
but
a
meal
of
a
character
substantial
enough
to
satisfy
youthful
appetites
and
lavish
in
the
matter
of
ripe
fruit
and
cakes
stewart
took
care
that
ruth
and
edna
barrington
who
for
a
wonder
had
come
unattended
were
well
looked
after
and
provided
with
such
few
dainties
as
they
permitted
themselves
to
indulge
in
being
under
a
solemn
pledge
to
their
mother
to
abstain
from
all
doubtful
dishes
there
were
crackers
although
it
was
not
christmas
time
and
a
pretty
box
of
laid
beside
every
plate
but
i
think
the
leading
glory
of
the
table
was
the
birthday
cake
which
according
to
charlotte
wright
reminded
one
of
a
wedding
or
a
christening
so
elaborate
were
the
designs
of
flowers
and
birds
in
white
sugar
and
chocolate
on
its
iced
surface
while
the
letters
of
isobel
name
were
displayed
on
six
little
flags
in
red
white
and
blue
which
adorned
the
summit
after
tea
came
a
variety
of
sports
for
prizes
archery
quoits
jumping
vaulting
and
obstacle
races
in
the
latter
of
which
considerable
ingenuity
had
been
shown
it
was
an
amusing
sight
to
watch
the
boys
clumsily
trying
to
thread
the
requisite
number
of
needles
before
they
might
make
a
start
and
toilsomely
sorting
red
and
white
beans
in
the
little
boxes
supplied
to
them
or
the
girls
picking
up
marbles
and
disentangling
coloured
ribbons
with
eager
fingers
the
potato
races
were
voted
great
fun
for
it
was
a
difficult
matter
to
run
carrying
a
large
and
knobby
potato
balanced
upon
an
egg
spoon
and
it
was
almost
sure
to
be
dropped
just
as
the
triumphant
candidate
was
on
the
point
of
tipping
it
into
the
box
at
the
end
giving
the
enemy
an
opportunity
of
making
up
arrears
and
of
proving
the
truth
of
the
proverb
that
the
race
sometimes
goes
to
the
slow
and
sure
instead
of
to
the
swift
races
were
popular
among
the
boys
and
bertie
rokeby
and
eric
wright
with
their
respective
right
and
left
legs
firmly
tied
together
against
charlie
chester
and
arnold
rokeby
similarly
handicapped
made
quite
an
exciting
struggle
the
former
couple
winning
in
the
end
owing
to
charlie
undue
haste
upsetting
both
himself
and
his
partner
the
jumping
and
vaulting
were
mostly
appreciated
by
the
older
children
but
both
big
and
little
exclaimed
with
delight
when
one
of
the
gardeners
brought
out
a
famous
aunt
sally
which
he
had
been
very
busy
making
with
a
turnip
for
her
head
carved
with
a
penknife
into
some
representation
of
a
human
face
over
which
reposed
an
ancient
bonnet
a
shawl
being
wrapped
round
her
shoulders
and
a
large
pipe
placed
between
her
simpering
lips
she
was
tied
securely
to
the
top
of
a
post
and
the
children
threw
sticks
at
her
the
game
being
to
see
who
could
first
knock
the
pipe
from
her
mouth
a
feat
which
proved
to
be
more
difficult
than
they
had
at
first
supposed
and
which
caused
much
merriment
the
prize
being
won
in
the
end
by
letty
rokeby
whose
aim
was
as
true
as
that
of
any
of
the
boys
the
sun
had
set
and
the
september
twilight
was
just
beginning
to
deepen
into
dark
when
the
young
guests
were
arranged
in
rows
on
the
terrace
steps
to
witness
the
final
treat
an
exhibition
of
fireworks
which
the
colonel
had
sent
a
special
telegram
to
london
to
obtain
in
time
it
was
a
very
pretty
display
of
catherine
wheels
roman
candles
rockets
and
golden
rain
finishing
with
the
royal
arms
in
crimson
fire
and
it
made
such
a
splendid
close
to
the
day
that
twenty
pairs
of
hands
clapped
loudly
and
twenty
voices
joined
in
ringing
cheers
as
the
little
red
stars
winked
themselves
out
into
the
darkness
the
party
was
at
an
end
and
an
omnibus
was
in
waiting
to
drive
the
visitors
all
unwilling
to
go
back
to
their
lodgings
at
silversands
isobel
kissed
belle
with
a
feeling
that
it
was
a
last
farewell
their
ways
for
the
future
lay
apart
they
had
different
ideals
and
different
hopes
in
life
alike
in
name
they
had
been
so
unlike
in
character
as
to
render
any
true
friendship
impossible
though
their
chance
meeting
had
been
fraught
with
such
unforeseen
consequences
it
was
little
more
than
six
weeks
since
isobel
had
first
arrived
at
silversands
yet
so
much
seemed
to
have
happened
in
the
time
that
as
she
stood
upon
the
steps
holding
her
grandfather
hand
she
could
scarcely
realize
the
strange
things
which
had
come
to
pass
sounded
on
all
sides
as
the
reluctant
sea
urchins
at
length
took
their
departure
most
of
them
would
be
scattered
to
their
own
homes
and
the
club
would
be
a
thing
of
the
past
i
shall
never
forget
any
of
you
never
said
isobel
we
had
glorious
fun
together
and
it
been
the
very
jolliest
holiday
i
ever
remember
in
my
life
i
ca
tell
you
how
much
i
enjoyed
your
coming
here
and
i
wish
every
one
of
you
as
happy
a
birthday
as
mine
