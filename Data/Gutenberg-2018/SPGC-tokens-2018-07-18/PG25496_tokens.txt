dora
did
some
white
sewing
they
laughed
ever
so
and
he
was
awfully
rude
to
the
servants
the
others
came
up
by
the
so
oswald
opened
the
and
squinted
down
and
there
was
that
archibald
what
are
you
staring
at
he
asked
nyang
nyang
jane
answered
tauntingly
when
father
came
home
there
was
an
awful
row
it
seems
the
sailor
was
asleep
but
of
course
we
did
not
know
or
we
should
not
have
disturbed
him
we
went
round
a
corner
rather
fast
and
came
slap
into
the
largest
woman
i
have
ever
seen
it
was
indeed
a
celestial
chinaman
in
deep
difficulties
on
the
sideboard
was
a
crockery
image
oswald
listened
as
carefully
as
he
could
but
denny
always
buzzes
so
when
he
whispers
it
was
not
till
next
day
that
he
owned
that
the
typewriter
had
been
a
fiend
in
disguise
the
stationmaster
and
porter
looked
respectfully
at
us
her
voice
when
she
told
us
we
were
trespassing
was
not
so
furious
the
lunch
was
a
perfect
dream
of
oswald
did
not
strike
the
next
match
carefully
enough
with
scissors
and
gas
pliers
they
cut
every
fuse
hi
brigands
he
exclaimed
it
was
rather
difficult
to
get
anything
the
shape
of
a
turkey
when
the
door
was
shut
he
said
i
ai
got
much
to
say
young
gemmen
the
five
others
oswald
saw
the
driver
wink
as
he
put
his
boot
on
the
step
and
the
porter
who
was
opening
the
cab
door
winked
back
he
looked
at
oswald
boots
he
fetched
down
half
a
dozen
planks
and
the
workman
how
much
said
the
gentleman
shortly
then
i
make
you
he
said
catching
hold
of
oswald
a
coastguard
ordered
us
quite
harshly
sure
enough
it
was
as
the
unamiable
one
said
when
he
had
tasted
it
i
say
bealie
dear
you
got
a
book
up
at
your
place
alice
beat
the
donkey
from
the
cart
the
rest
shouted
we
got
musical
instruments
said
noël
road
to
rome
or
the
silly
we
bastables
have
only
two
uncles
and
neither
of
them
are
our
own
relatives
one
is
a
and
the
other
is
the
uncle
from
his
birth
of
albert
who
used
to
live
next
door
to
us
in
the
lewisham
road
when
we
first
got
to
know
him
it
was
over
some
baked
potatoes
and
is
quite
another
story
we
called
him
and
then
albert
uncle
for
short
but
albert
uncle
and
my
father
joined
in
taking
a
jolly
house
in
the
country
called
the
moat
house
and
we
stayed
there
for
our
summer
holidays
and
it
was
there
through
an
accident
to
a
pilgrim
with
peas
in
his
shoes
that
another
story
too
that
we
found
albert
love
and
as
she
was
very
old
indeed
next
birthday
and
he
was
ever
so
much
older
in
the
vale
of
years
he
had
to
get
married
almost
directly
and
it
was
fixed
for
about
and
when
our
holidays
came
the
whole
six
of
us
went
down
to
the
moat
house
with
father
and
albert
uncle
we
never
had
a
christmas
in
the
country
before
it
was
simply
ripping
and
the
love
her
name
was
miss
ashleigh
but
we
were
allowed
to
call
her
aunt
margaret
even
before
the
wedding
made
it
really
legal
for
us
to
do
so
she
and
her
jolly
clergyman
brother
used
to
come
over
and
sometimes
we
went
to
the
cedars
where
they
live
and
we
had
games
and
charades
and
and
devil
in
the
dark
which
is
a
game
girls
pretend
to
like
and
very
few
do
really
and
crackers
and
a
for
the
village
children
and
everything
you
can
jolly
well
think
of
and
all
the
time
whenever
we
went
to
the
cedars
there
was
all
sorts
of
silly
fuss
going
on
about
the
beastly
wedding
boxes
coming
from
london
with
hats
and
jackets
in
and
wedding
presents
all
glassy
and
silvery
or
else
brooches
and
chains
and
clothes
sent
down
from
london
to
choose
from
i
ca
think
how
a
lady
can
want
so
many
petticoats
and
boots
and
things
just
because
she
going
to
be
married
no
man
would
think
of
getting
shirts
and
waistcoats
and
so
on
just
to
be
married
in
it
because
they
going
to
rome
i
think
alice
said
when
we
talked
it
over
before
the
fire
in
the
kitchen
the
day
pettigrew
went
to
see
her
aunt
and
we
were
allowed
to
make
toffee
you
see
in
rome
you
can
only
buy
roman
clothes
and
i
think
they
all
stupid
bright
colours
at
least
i
know
the
sashes
are
you
stir
now
oswald
my
face
is
all
burnt
black
oswald
took
the
spoon
though
it
was
really
not
his
turn
by
three
but
he
is
one
whose
nature
is
so
that
he
can
not
make
a
fuss
about
little
things
and
he
knows
he
can
make
toffee
lucky
hounds
said
to
be
going
to
rome
i
wish
i
was
hounds
is
polite
dear
dora
said
and
said
well
lucky
bargees
then
it
the
dream
of
my
life
to
go
to
rome
noël
said
noël
is
our
poet
brother
just
think
of
what
the
man
says
in
the
road
i
wish
they
take
me
they
wo
dicky
said
it
costs
a
most
awful
lot
i
heard
father
saying
so
only
yesterday
it
would
only
be
the
fare
noël
answered
and
i
go
third
or
even
in
a
or
a
luggage
van
and
when
i
got
there
i
could
easily
earn
my
own
living
i
make
ballads
and
sing
them
in
the
streets
the
italians
would
give
me
lyres
that
the
italian
kind
of
shilling
they
spell
it
with
an
it
shows
how
poetical
they
are
out
there
their
calling
it
that
but
you
could
make
italian
poetry
said
staring
at
noël
with
his
mouth
open
oh
i
do
know
so
much
about
that
noël
said
i
could
jolly
soon
learn
anyway
and
just
to
begin
with
i
do
it
in
english
there
are
sure
to
be
some
people
who
would
understand
and
if
they
did
you
think
their
warm
southern
hearts
would
be
touched
to
see
a
pale
slender
foreign
figure
singing
plaintive
ballads
in
an
unknown
tongue
i
do
oh
they
chuck
along
the
lyres
fast
enough
they
not
hard
and
cold
like
north
people
why
every
one
here
is
a
brewer
or
a
baker
or
a
banker
or
a
butcher
or
something
dull
over
there
they
all
bandits
or
vineyardiners
or
play
the
guitar
or
something
and
they
crush
the
red
grapes
and
dance
and
laugh
in
the
sun
you
know
jolly
well
they
do
this
toffee
about
done
said
oswald
suddenly
shut
your
silly
mouth
and
get
a
cupful
of
cold
water
and
then
what
with
dropping
a
little
of
the
toffee
into
the
water
to
see
if
it
was
ready
and
pouring
some
on
a
plate
that
was
buttered
and
not
being
able
to
get
it
off
again
when
it
was
cold
without
breaking
the
plate
and
the
warm
row
there
was
about
its
being
one
of
the
best
ones
the
wild
romances
of
noël
poetical
intellect
went
out
of
our
heads
altogether
and
it
was
not
till
later
and
when
deep
in
the
waters
of
affliction
that
they
were
brought
back
to
us
next
day
said
to
dora
i
want
to
speak
to
you
all
by
yourself
and
me
so
they
went
into
the
secret
staircase
that
creaks
and
has
been
secret
now
for
countless
years
and
after
that
dora
did
some
white
sewing
she
would
let
us
look
at
and
helped
her
illustration
dora
did
some
white
sewing
it
another
wedding
present
you
may
depend
dicky
said
a
beastly
surprise
i
should
wonder
and
no
more
was
said
the
rest
of
us
were
busy
skating
on
the
moat
for
it
was
now
freezing
hard
dora
never
did
care
for
skating
she
says
it
hurts
her
feet
and
now
christmas
and
boxing
day
passed
like
a
radiating
dream
and
it
was
the
we
all
had
to
go
to
the
bride
mother
house
before
the
wedding
so
as
to
go
to
church
with
the
wedding
party
the
girls
had
always
wanted
to
be
somebody
bridesmaids
and
now
they
were
in
white
cloth
coats
like
coachmen
with
lots
of
little
capes
and
white
beaver
bonnets
they
did
look
so
bad
though
rather
as
if
they
were
in
a
christmas
card
and
their
dresses
were
white
silk
like
under
the
long
coats
and
their
shoes
had
real
silver
buckles
our
great
indian
uncle
gave
them
went
back
just
as
the
waggonette
was
starting
and
came
out
with
a
big
parcel
we
thought
it
was
the
secret
surprise
present
dora
had
been
making
and
indeed
when
i
asked
her
she
nodded
we
little
recked
what
it
really
was
or
how
our
young
brother
was
going
to
shove
himself
forward
once
again
he
do
it
nothing
you
say
is
of
any
lasting
use
there
were
a
great
many
people
at
the
wedding
quite
crowds
there
was
lots
to
eat
and
drink
and
though
it
was
all
cold
it
did
not
matter
because
there
were
blazing
fires
in
every
fireplace
in
the
house
and
the
place
all
decorated
with
holly
and
mistletoe
and
things
every
one
seemed
to
enjoy
themselves
very
much
except
albert
uncle
and
his
blushing
bride
and
they
looked
desperate
every
one
said
how
sweet
she
looked
but
oswald
thought
she
looked
as
if
she
did
like
being
married
as
much
as
she
expected
she
was
not
at
all
a
blushing
bride
really
only
the
tip
of
her
nose
got
pink
because
it
was
rather
cold
in
the
church
but
she
is
very
jolly
her
reverend
but
nice
brother
read
the
marriage
service
he
reads
better
than
any
one
i
know
but
he
is
not
a
bit
of
a
prig
really
when
you
come
to
know
him
when
the
rash
act
was
done
albert
uncle
and
his
bride
went
home
in
a
carriage
all
by
themselves
and
then
we
had
the
lunch
and
drank
the
health
of
the
bride
in
real
champagne
though
father
said
we
kids
must
only
have
just
a
taste
i
sure
oswald
for
one
did
not
want
any
more
one
taste
was
quite
enough
champagne
is
like
with
medicine
in
it
the
sherry
we
put
sugar
in
once
was
much
more
decent
then
miss
ashleigh
i
mean
albert
uncle
went
away
and
took
off
her
white
dress
and
came
back
looking
much
warmer
dora
heard
the
housemaid
say
afterwards
that
the
cook
had
stopped
the
bride
on
the
stairs
with
a
basin
of
hot
soup
that
would
take
no
denial
because
the
bride
poor
dear
young
thing
not
a
bite
or
sup
had
passed
her
lips
that
day
we
understood
then
why
she
had
looked
so
unhappy
but
uncle
had
had
a
jolly
good
breakfast
fish
and
eggs
and
bacon
and
three
goes
of
marmalade
so
it
was
not
hunger
made
him
sad
perhaps
he
was
thinking
what
a
lot
of
money
it
cost
to
be
married
and
go
to
rome
a
little
before
the
bride
went
to
change
got
up
and
reached
his
parcel
from
under
the
sideboard
and
sneaked
out
we
thought
he
might
have
let
us
see
it
given
whatever
it
was
and
dora
said
she
had
understood
he
meant
to
but
it
was
his
secret
the
bride
went
away
looking
quite
comfy
in
a
furry
cloak
and
uncle
cheered
up
at
the
last
and
threw
off
the
burden
of
his
cares
and
made
a
joke
i
forget
what
it
was
it
was
a
very
good
one
but
it
showed
he
was
trying
to
make
the
best
of
things
then
the
bridal
sufferers
drove
away
with
the
luggage
on
a
cart
heaps
and
heaps
of
it
and
we
all
cheered
and
threw
rice
and
slippers
ashleigh
and
some
other
old
ladies
cried
and
then
every
one
said
what
a
pretty
wedding
and
began
to
go
and
when
our
waggonette
came
round
we
all
began
to
get
in
and
suddenly
father
said
where
and
we
looked
round
he
was
in
absence
fetch
him
along
sharp
some
of
you
father
said
i
do
want
to
keep
the
horses
standing
here
in
the
cold
all
day
so
oswald
and
dicky
went
to
fetch
him
along
we
thought
he
might
have
wandered
back
to
what
was
left
of
the
lunch
for
he
is
young
and
he
does
not
always
know
better
but
he
was
not
there
and
oswald
did
not
even
take
a
crystallised
fruit
in
passing
he
might
easily
have
done
this
and
no
one
would
have
minded
so
it
would
not
have
been
wrong
but
it
would
have
been
ungentlemanly
dicky
did
not
either
was
not
there
we
went
into
the
other
rooms
even
the
one
the
old
ladies
were
crying
in
but
of
course
we
begged
their
pardons
and
at
last
into
the
kitchen
where
the
servants
were
smart
with
white
bows
and
just
sitting
down
to
their
dinner
and
dicky
said
i
say
cookie
love
have
you
seen
do
come
here
with
your
imperence
the
cook
said
but
she
was
pleased
with
dicky
unmeaning
compliment
all
the
same
see
him
said
the
housemaid
he
was
colloguing
with
the
butcher
in
the
yard
a
bit
since
he
got
a
parcel
perhaps
he
got
a
lift
home
so
we
went
and
told
father
and
about
the
white
present
in
the
parcel
i
expect
he
was
ashamed
to
give
it
after
all
oswald
said
so
he
hooked
off
home
with
it
and
we
got
into
the
wagonette
it
was
a
present
though
dora
said
it
was
a
different
kind
of
surprise
but
it
really
is
a
secret
our
good
father
did
not
command
her
to
betray
her
young
brother
but
when
we
got
home
was
there
pettigrew
had
seen
him
and
he
was
nowhere
about
father
biked
back
to
the
cedars
to
see
if
turned
up
no
then
all
the
gentlemen
turned
out
to
look
for
him
through
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
land
he
too
old
to
be
stolen
by
gipsies
alice
said
and
too
ugly
said
dicky
oh
said
both
the
girls
and
now
when
he
lost
too
we
had
looked
for
a
long
time
before
pettigrew
came
in
with
a
parcel
she
said
the
butcher
had
left
it
was
not
addressed
but
we
knew
it
was
because
of
the
label
on
the
paper
from
the
shop
where
father
gets
his
shirts
father
opened
it
at
once
inside
the
parcel
we
found
boots
and
braces
his
best
hat
and
his
and
oswald
felt
as
if
we
had
found
his
skeleton
any
row
with
any
of
you
father
asked
but
there
had
been
any
was
he
worried
about
anything
done
anything
wrong
and
afraid
to
own
up
we
turned
cold
for
we
knew
what
he
meant
that
parcel
was
so
horribly
like
the
lady
hat
and
gloves
that
she
takes
off
on
the
seashore
and
leaves
with
a
letter
saying
it
has
come
to
this
no
no
we
all
said
he
was
perfectly
jolly
all
the
morning
then
suddenly
dicky
leaned
on
the
table
and
one
of
boots
toppled
over
and
there
was
something
white
inside
it
was
a
letter
must
have
written
it
before
we
left
home
it
said
dear
father
and
every
one
i
am
going
to
be
a
clown
when
i
am
rich
and
reveared
i
will
come
back
rolling
your
affectionate
son
horace
octavius
bastable
rolling
father
said
he
means
rolling
in
money
alice
said
oswald
noticed
that
every
one
round
the
table
where
boots
were
dignifiedly
respected
as
they
lay
was
a
horrid
pale
colour
like
when
the
salt
is
thrown
into
snapdragons
oh
dear
dora
cried
that
was
it
he
asked
me
to
make
him
a
dress
and
keep
it
deeply
secret
he
said
he
wanted
to
surprise
aunt
margaret
and
albert
uncle
and
i
did
think
it
was
wrong
said
dora
screwing
up
her
face
she
then
added
oh
dear
oh
dear
oh
oh
and
with
these
concluding
remarks
she
began
to
howl
father
thumped
her
on
the
back
in
an
absent
yet
kind
way
but
where
he
gone
he
said
not
to
any
one
in
particular
i
saw
the
butcher
he
said
asked
him
to
take
a
parcel
home
and
went
back
round
the
cedars
here
dicky
coughed
and
said
i
did
think
he
meant
anything
but
the
day
after
noël
was
talking
about
singing
ballads
in
rome
and
getting
poet
lyres
given
him
did
say
if
noël
had
been
really
keen
on
the
roman
lyres
and
things
he
could
easily
have
been
a
stowaway
and
gone
unknown
a
stowaway
said
my
father
sitting
down
suddenly
and
hard
in
aunt
margaret
big
dress
basket
the
one
she
let
him
hide
in
when
we
had
there
he
talked
a
lot
about
it
after
noël
had
said
that
about
the
lyres
and
the
italians
being
so
poetical
you
know
you
remember
that
day
we
had
toffee
my
father
is
prompt
and
decisive
in
action
so
is
his
eldest
son
i
off
to
the
cedars
he
said
do
let
me
come
father
said
the
decisive
son
you
may
want
to
send
a
message
so
in
a
moment
father
was
on
his
bike
and
oswald
on
the
step
a
dangerous
but
delightful
spot
and
off
to
the
cedars
have
your
teas
and
any
more
of
you
get
lost
and
do
sit
up
if
we
late
father
howled
to
them
as
we
rushed
away
how
glad
then
the
thoughtful
oswald
was
that
he
was
the
eldest
it
was
very
cold
in
the
dusk
on
the
bicycle
but
oswald
did
not
complain
at
the
cedars
my
father
explained
in
a
few
manly
but
words
and
the
apartment
of
the
dear
departed
bride
was
searched
because
said
my
father
if
really
was
little
ass
enough
to
get
into
that
basket
he
must
have
turned
out
something
to
make
room
for
himself
sure
enough
when
they
came
to
look
there
was
a
great
bundle
rolled
in
a
sheet
under
the
bed
all
lace
things
and
petticoats
and
ribbons
and
and
ladies
flummery
if
you
will
put
the
things
in
something
else
i
catch
the
express
to
dover
and
take
it
with
me
father
said
to
ashleigh
and
while
she
packed
the
things
he
explained
to
some
of
the
crying
old
ladies
who
had
been
unable
to
leave
off
how
sorry
he
was
that
a
son
of
his
but
you
know
the
sort
of
thing
oswald
said
father
i
wish
you
let
me
come
too
i
wo
be
a
bit
of
trouble
perhaps
it
was
partly
because
my
father
did
want
to
let
me
walk
home
in
the
dark
and
he
did
want
to
worry
the
ashleighs
any
more
by
asking
them
to
send
me
home
he
said
this
was
why
but
i
hope
it
was
his
loving
wish
to
have
his
prompt
son
so
like
himself
in
his
decisiveness
with
him
we
went
it
was
an
anxious
journey
we
knew
how
far
from
pleased
the
bride
would
be
to
find
no
and
ribbons
but
only
crying
and
cross
and
dirty
as
likely
as
not
when
she
opened
the
basket
at
the
hotel
at
dover
father
smoked
to
pass
the
time
but
oswald
had
not
so
much
as
a
peppermint
or
a
bit
of
spanish
liquorice
to
help
him
through
the
journey
yet
he
bore
up
when
we
got
out
at
dover
there
were
and
albert
uncle
on
the
platform
hullo
said
albert
uncle
what
up
nothing
wrong
at
home
i
hope
we
only
lost
said
my
father
you
do
happen
to
have
him
with
you
no
but
you
joking
said
the
bride
we
lost
a
a
the
words
struck
us
dumb
but
my
father
recovered
speech
and
explained
the
bride
was
very
glad
when
we
said
we
had
brought
her
ribbons
and
things
but
we
stood
in
anxious
gloom
for
now
was
indeed
lost
the
might
be
on
its
way
to
liverpool
or
rocking
on
the
channel
and
might
never
be
found
again
oswald
did
not
say
these
things
it
is
best
to
hold
your
jaw
when
you
want
to
see
a
thing
out
and
are
liable
to
be
sent
to
bed
at
a
strange
hotel
if
any
one
happens
to
remember
you
then
suddenly
the
station
master
came
with
a
telegram
it
said
a
without
label
at
cannon
street
detained
for
identification
suspicious
sounds
from
inside
detain
inquirers
dynamite
machine
suspected
he
did
not
show
us
this
till
my
father
had
told
him
about
which
it
took
some
time
for
him
to
believe
and
then
he
did
and
laughed
and
said
he
would
wire
them
to
get
the
dynamite
machine
to
speak
and
if
so
to
take
it
out
and
keep
it
till
its
father
called
for
it
so
back
we
went
to
london
with
hearts
a
little
lighter
but
not
gay
for
we
were
a
very
long
time
from
the
last
things
we
had
had
to
eat
and
oswald
was
almost
sorry
he
had
not
taken
those
crystallised
fruits
it
was
quite
late
when
we
got
to
cannon
street
and
we
went
straight
into
the
cloakroom
and
there
was
the
man
in
charge
a
very
jolly
chap
sitting
on
a
stool
and
there
was
the
guilty
stowaway
dressed
in
a
clown
dress
very
dusty
and
his
face
as
dirty
as
i
have
ever
seen
it
sitting
on
some
one
else
tin
box
with
his
feet
on
some
body
else
portmanteau
eating
bread
and
cheese
and
drinking
ale
out
of
a
can
my
father
claimed
him
at
once
and
oswald
identified
the
basket
it
was
very
large
there
was
a
tray
on
the
top
with
hats
in
it
and
had
this
on
top
of
him
we
all
went
to
bed
in
cannon
street
hotel
my
father
said
nothing
to
that
night
when
we
were
in
bed
i
tried
to
get
to
tell
me
all
about
it
but
he
was
too
sleepy
and
cross
it
was
the
beer
and
the
knocking
about
in
the
basket
i
suppose
next
day
we
went
back
to
the
moat
house
where
the
raving
anxiousness
of
the
others
had
been
cooled
the
night
before
by
a
telegram
from
dover
my
father
said
he
would
speak
to
in
the
evening
it
is
very
horrid
not
to
be
spoken
to
at
once
and
get
it
over
but
certainly
deserved
something
it
is
hard
to
tell
this
tale
because
so
much
of
it
happened
all
at
once
but
at
different
places
but
this
is
what
said
to
us
about
it
he
said
do
bother
let
me
alone
but
we
were
all
kind
and
gentle
and
at
last
we
got
it
out
of
him
what
had
happened
he
does
tell
a
story
right
from
the
beginning
like
oswald
and
some
of
the
others
do
but
from
his
disjunctured
words
the
author
has
made
the
following
narration
this
is
called
editing
i
believe
it
was
all
noël
fault
said
what
did
he
want
to
go
jawing
about
rome
for
and
a
clown
as
good
as
a
beastly
poet
anyhow
you
remember
that
day
we
made
toffee
well
i
thought
of
it
then
you
did
tell
us
yes
i
did
i
half
told
dicky
he
never
said
do
or
you
better
not
or
gave
me
any
good
advice
or
anything
it
his
fault
as
much
as
mine
father
ought
to
speak
to
him
the
same
as
me
and
noël
too
we
bore
with
him
just
then
because
we
wanted
to
hear
the
story
and
we
made
him
go
on
well
so
i
thought
if
noël
a
cowardy
custard
i
not
and
i
afraid
of
being
in
the
basket
though
it
was
quite
dark
till
i
cut
the
with
my
knife
in
the
railway
van
i
think
i
cut
the
string
off
the
label
it
fell
off
afterwards
and
i
saw
it
through
the
hole
but
of
course
i
could
say
anything
i
thought
they
look
after
their
silly
luggage
better
than
that
it
was
all
their
fault
i
was
lost
tell
us
how
you
did
it
dear
dora
said
never
mind
about
it
being
everybody
else
fault
it
yours
as
much
as
any
one
if
you
come
to
that
said
you
made
me
the
clown
dress
when
i
asked
you
you
never
said
a
word
about
not
so
there
oh
you
unkind
dora
said
you
know
you
said
it
was
for
a
surprise
for
the
bridal
pair
so
it
would
have
been
if
they
found
me
at
rome
and
i
popped
up
like
what
i
meant
to
like
a
and
said
we
are
again
in
my
clown
clothes
at
them
but
it
all
spoiled
and
father
going
to
speak
to
me
this
evening
sniffed
every
time
he
stopped
speaking
but
we
did
not
correct
him
then
we
wanted
to
hear
about
everything
why
did
you
tell
me
straight
out
what
you
were
going
to
do
dicky
asked
because
you
jolly
well
have
shut
me
up
you
always
do
if
i
want
to
do
anything
you
have
thought
of
yourself
what
did
you
take
with
you
asked
alice
in
a
hurry
for
was
now
sniffing
far
beyond
a
whisper
oh
i
saved
a
lot
of
grub
only
i
forgot
it
at
the
last
it
under
the
chest
of
drawers
in
our
room
and
i
had
my
knife
and
i
changed
into
the
clown
dress
in
the
cupboard
at
the
ashleighs
over
my
own
things
because
i
thought
it
would
be
cold
and
then
i
emptied
the
rotten
clothes
out
and
hid
them
and
the
tray
i
just
put
it
on
a
chair
near
and
i
got
into
the
basket
and
i
lifted
the
tray
up
over
my
head
and
sat
down
and
fitted
it
down
over
me
it
got
webbing
bars
you
know
across
it
and
none
of
you
would
ever
have
thought
of
it
let
alone
doing
it
i
should
hope
not
dora
said
but
went
on
unhearing
i
began
to
think
perhaps
i
wished
i
had
directly
they
strapped
up
the
basket
it
was
beastly
hot
and
stuffy
i
had
to
cut
an
in
the
cart
and
i
cut
my
thumb
it
was
so
bumpety
and
they
threw
me
about
as
if
i
was
coals
and
wrong
way
up
as
often
as
not
and
the
train
was
awful
wobbly
and
i
felt
so
sick
and
if
i
had
the
grub
i
have
eaten
it
i
had
a
bottle
of
water
and
that
was
all
right
till
i
dropped
the
cork
and
i
could
find
it
in
the
dark
till
the
water
got
upset
and
then
i
found
the
cork
that
minute
and
when
they
dumped
the
basket
on
to
the
platform
i
was
so
glad
to
sit
still
a
minute
without
being
jogged
i
nearly
went
to
sleep
and
then
i
looked
out
and
the
label
was
off
and
lying
close
by
and
then
some
one
gave
the
basket
a
kick
big
brute
i
like
to
kick
him
and
said
this
here
and
i
daresay
i
did
squeak
like
a
you
know
and
then
some
one
said
like
do
it
no
label
and
he
was
standing
on
the
label
all
the
time
i
saw
the
string
sticking
out
under
his
nasty
boot
and
then
they
trundled
me
off
somewhere
on
a
wheelbarrow
it
felt
like
and
dumped
me
down
again
in
a
dark
place
and
i
could
see
anything
more
i
wonder
said
the
thoughtful
oswald
what
made
them
think
you
were
a
dynamite
machine
oh
that
was
awful
said
it
was
my
watch
i
wound
it
up
just
for
something
to
do
you
know
the
row
it
makes
since
it
was
broken
and
i
heard
some
one
say
what
that
and
then
like
an
infernal
machine
do
go
shoving
me
dora
it
was
him
said
it
not
me
and
then
i
was
the
inspector
i
dump
it
down
in
the
river
so
i
would
any
way
let
shift
it
but
the
other
said
well
alone
so
i
was
dumped
any
more
and
they
fetched
another
man
and
there
was
a
heap
of
jaw
and
i
heard
them
say
so
i
let
them
have
it
illustration
they
laughed
ever
so
what
you
do
oh
i
just
kicked
about
in
the
basket
and
i
heard
them
all
start
off
and
i
shouted
here
let
me
out
ca
you
and
did
they
yes
but
not
for
ever
so
long
i
had
to
jaw
at
them
through
the
cracks
of
the
basket
and
when
they
opened
it
there
was
quite
a
crowd
and
they
laughed
ever
so
and
gave
me
bread
and
cheese
and
said
i
was
a
plucky
youngster
and
i
am
and
i
do
wish
father
would
put
things
off
so
he
might
just
as
well
have
spoken
to
me
this
morning
and
i
ca
see
done
anything
so
awful
and
it
all
your
faults
for
not
looking
after
me
are
i
your
little
brother
and
it
your
duty
to
see
i
do
right
you
told
me
so
often
enough
these
last
words
checked
the
severe
reprimand
trembling
on
the
hitherto
patient
oswald
lips
and
then
began
to
cry
and
dora
nursed
him
though
generally
he
is
much
too
big
for
this
and
knows
it
and
he
went
to
sleep
on
her
lap
and
said
he
did
want
any
dinner
when
it
came
to
father
speaking
to
that
evening
it
never
came
off
because
was
ill
in
bed
not
sham
you
know
but
real
ill
the
doctor
said
it
was
fever
from
chill
and
excitement
but
i
think
myself
it
was
very
likely
the
things
he
ate
at
lunch
and
the
shaking
up
and
then
the
bread
and
cheese
and
the
beer
out
of
a
can
he
was
ill
a
week
when
he
was
better
not
much
was
said
my
father
who
is
the
justest
man
in
england
said
the
boy
had
been
punished
enough
and
so
he
had
for
he
missed
going
to
the
pantomime
and
to
peter
at
the
garrick
theatre
which
is
far
and
away
the
best
play
that
ever
was
done
and
quite
different
from
any
other
acting
i
ever
saw
they
are
exactly
like
real
boys
i
think
they
must
have
been
reading
about
us
and
he
had
to
take
a
lot
of
the
filthiest
medicine
i
ever
tasted
i
wonder
if
father
told
the
doctor
to
make
it
nasty
on
purpose
a
woman
would
have
directly
but
gentlemen
are
not
generally
so
sly
any
way
you
live
and
learn
none
of
us
would
now
ever
consent
to
be
a
stowaway
no
matter
who
wanted
us
to
and
i
do
think
very
likely
to
do
it
again
the
only
punishment
he
had
was
seeing
the
clown
dress
burnt
before
his
eyes
by
father
he
had
bought
it
all
with
his
own
money
red
trimmings
and
all
of
course
when
he
got
well
we
soon
taught
him
not
to
say
again
that
it
was
any
of
our
faults
as
he
owned
himself
he
our
little
brother
and
we
are
not
going
to
stand
that
kind
of
cheek
from
it
was
christmas
nearly
a
year
after
mother
died
i
can
not
write
about
mother
but
i
will
just
say
one
thing
if
she
had
only
been
away
for
a
little
while
and
not
for
always
we
should
have
been
so
keen
on
having
a
christmas
i
did
understand
this
then
but
i
am
much
older
now
and
i
think
it
was
just
because
everything
was
so
different
and
horrid
we
felt
we
do
something
and
perhaps
we
were
not
particular
enough
things
make
you
much
more
unhappy
when
you
loaf
about
than
when
you
are
doing
events
father
had
to
go
away
just
about
christmas
he
had
heard
that
his
wicked
partner
who
ran
away
with
his
money
was
in
france
and
he
thought
he
could
catch
him
but
really
he
was
in
spain
where
catching
criminals
is
never
practised
we
did
not
know
this
till
afterwards
before
father
went
away
he
took
dora
and
oswald
into
his
study
and
said
i
awfully
sorry
i
got
to
go
away
but
it
is
very
serious
business
and
i
must
go
you
be
good
while
i
away
kiddies
wo
you
we
promised
faithfully
then
he
said
there
are
reasons
you
would
understand
if
i
tried
to
tell
you
but
you
ca
have
much
of
a
christmas
this
year
but
i
told
matilda
to
make
you
a
good
plain
pudding
perhaps
next
christmas
will
be
brighter
it
was
for
the
next
christmas
saw
us
the
affluent
nephews
and
nieces
of
an
indian
uncle
but
that
is
quite
another
story
as
good
old
kipling
says
when
father
had
been
seen
off
at
lewisham
station
with
his
bags
and
a
plaid
rug
in
a
strap
we
came
home
again
and
it
was
horrid
there
were
papers
and
things
littered
all
over
his
room
where
he
had
packed
we
tidied
the
room
up
it
was
the
only
thing
we
could
do
for
him
it
was
dicky
who
accidentally
broke
his
and
made
a
paper
boat
out
of
a
letter
we
found
out
afterwards
father
particularly
wanted
to
keep
this
took
us
some
time
and
when
we
went
into
the
nursery
the
fire
was
black
out
and
we
could
not
get
it
alight
again
even
with
the
whole
matilda
who
was
our
general
then
was
out
as
well
as
the
fire
so
we
went
and
sat
in
the
kitchen
there
is
always
a
good
fire
in
kitchens
the
kitchen
hearthrug
was
not
nice
to
sit
on
so
we
spread
newspapers
on
it
it
was
sitting
in
the
kitchen
i
think
that
brought
to
our
minds
my
father
parting
words
about
the
pudding
i
mean
oswald
said
father
said
we
could
have
much
of
a
christmas
for
secret
reasons
and
he
said
he
had
told
matilda
to
make
us
a
plain
pudding
the
plain
pudding
instantly
cast
its
shadow
over
the
deepening
gloom
of
our
young
minds
i
wonder
plain
she
make
it
dicky
said
as
plain
as
plain
you
may
depend
said
oswald
a
pudding
that
her
sort
the
others
groaned
and
we
gathered
closer
round
the
fire
till
the
newspapers
rustled
madly
i
believe
i
could
make
a
pudding
that
plain
if
i
tried
alice
said
why
should
we
no
chink
said
oswald
with
brief
sadness
how
much
would
it
cost
noël
asked
and
added
that
dora
had
twopence
and
had
a
french
halfpenny
dora
got
the
out
of
the
dresser
drawer
where
it
lay
doubled
up
among
dirty
dusters
scallop
shells
string
penny
novelettes
and
the
corkscrew
the
general
we
had
then
it
seemed
as
if
she
did
all
the
cooking
on
the
instead
of
on
the
there
were
traces
of
so
many
bygone
meals
upon
its
pages
it
does
say
christmas
pudding
at
all
said
dora
try
plum
the
resourceful
oswald
instantly
counselled
dora
turned
the
greasy
pages
anxiously
rich
with
flour
brandy
sauce
for
we
should
care
about
that
so
it
no
use
looking
without
eggs
we
do
want
anyhow
that
the
one
it
took
her
a
long
time
to
find
the
page
oswald
got
a
shovel
of
coals
and
made
up
the
fire
it
blazed
up
like
the
devouring
elephant
the
always
calls
it
then
dora
read
time
six
hours
to
eat
it
in
said
no
silly
to
make
it
forge
ahead
dora
dicky
replied
dora
went
on
one
pound
and
a
half
of
raisins
half
a
pound
of
currants
three
quarters
of
a
pound
of
breadcrumbs
half
a
pound
of
flour
of
a
pound
of
beef
suet
nine
eggs
one
wine
glassful
of
brandy
half
a
pound
of
citron
and
orange
peel
half
a
nutmeg
and
a
little
ground
ginger
i
wonder
little
ground
ginger
a
teacupful
would
be
enough
i
think
alice
said
we
must
not
be
extravagant
we
have
got
anything
yet
to
be
extravagant
said
oswald
who
had
toothache
that
day
what
would
you
do
with
the
things
if
you
got
them
you
the
suet
as
fine
as
possible
i
wonder
how
fine
that
is
replied
dora
and
the
book
together
mix
it
with
the
breadcrumbs
and
flour
add
the
currants
washed
and
dried
not
starched
then
said
alice
citron
and
orange
peel
cut
into
thin
slices
i
wonder
what
they
call
thin
matilda
thin
is
quite
different
from
what
i
mean
by
it
the
raisins
stoned
and
divided
how
many
heaps
would
you
divide
them
into
seven
i
suppose
said
alice
one
for
each
person
and
one
for
the
pot
i
mean
pudding
it
all
well
together
with
the
grated
nutmeg
and
ginger
then
stir
in
nine
eggs
well
beaten
and
the
brandy
we
leave
that
out
i
think
again
mix
it
thoroughly
together
that
every
ingredient
may
be
moistened
put
it
into
a
buttered
mould
tie
over
tightly
and
boil
for
six
hours
serve
it
ornamented
with
holly
and
brandy
poured
over
it
i
should
think
holly
and
brandy
poured
over
it
would
be
simply
beastly
said
dicky
i
expect
the
book
knows
i
daresay
holly
and
water
would
do
as
well
though
pudding
may
be
made
a
month
before
it
no
use
reading
about
that
though
because
we
only
got
four
days
to
christmas
it
no
use
reading
about
any
of
it
said
oswald
with
thoughtful
repeatedness
because
we
have
got
the
things
and
we
have
got
the
coin
to
get
them
we
might
get
the
tin
somehow
said
dicky
there
must
be
lots
of
kind
people
who
would
subscribe
to
a
christmas
pudding
for
poor
children
who
had
any
noël
said
well
i
going
skating
at
penn
said
oswald
it
no
use
thinking
about
puddings
we
must
put
up
with
it
plain
so
he
went
and
dicky
went
with
him
when
they
returned
to
their
home
in
the
evening
the
fire
had
been
lighted
again
in
the
nursery
and
the
others
were
just
having
tea
we
toasted
our
on
the
bare
side
and
it
gets
a
little
warm
among
the
butter
this
is
called
french
toast
i
like
english
better
but
it
is
more
expensive
alice
said
matilda
is
in
a
frightful
rage
about
your
putting
those
coals
on
the
kitchen
fire
oswald
she
says
we
sha
have
enough
to
last
over
christmas
as
it
is
and
father
gave
her
a
talking
to
before
he
went
about
them
asked
her
if
she
ate
them
she
says
but
i
do
believe
he
did
anyway
she
locked
the
door
and
she
got
the
key
in
her
pocket
i
do
see
how
we
can
boil
the
pudding
what
pudding
said
oswald
dreamily
he
was
thinking
of
a
chap
he
had
seen
at
penn
who
had
cut
the
date
on
the
ice
with
four
strokes
pudding
alice
said
oh
we
had
such
a
time
oswald
first
dora
and
i
went
to
the
shops
to
find
out
exactly
what
the
pudding
would
cost
it
only
two
and
elevenpence
halfpenny
counting
in
the
holly
it
no
good
oswald
repeated
he
is
very
patient
and
will
say
the
same
thing
any
number
of
times
it
no
good
you
know
we
got
no
tin
ah
said
alice
but
noël
and
i
went
out
and
we
called
at
some
of
the
houses
in
granville
park
and
dartmouth
hill
and
we
got
a
lot
of
sixpences
and
shillings
besides
pennies
and
one
old
gentleman
gave
us
he
was
so
nice
quite
bald
with
a
knitted
red
and
blue
waistcoat
we
got
oswald
did
not
feel
quite
sure
father
would
like
us
to
go
asking
for
shillings
and
sixpences
or
even
from
strangers
but
he
did
not
say
so
the
money
had
been
asked
for
and
got
and
it
could
be
helped
and
perhaps
he
wanted
the
pudding
i
am
not
able
to
remember
exactly
why
he
did
not
speak
up
and
say
this
is
wrong
but
anyway
he
did
alice
and
dora
went
out
and
bought
the
things
next
morning
they
bought
double
quantities
so
that
it
came
to
five
shillings
and
elevenpence
and
was
enough
to
make
a
noble
pudding
there
was
a
lot
of
holly
left
over
for
decorations
we
used
very
little
for
the
sauce
the
money
that
was
left
we
spent
very
anxiously
in
other
things
to
eat
such
as
dates
and
figs
and
toffee
we
did
not
tell
matilda
about
it
she
was
a
girl
and
apt
to
turn
shirty
at
the
least
thing
concealed
under
our
jackets
and
overcoats
we
carried
the
parcels
up
to
the
nursery
and
hid
them
in
the
we
had
there
it
was
the
bureau
drawer
it
was
locked
up
afterwards
because
the
treacle
got
all
over
the
green
baize
and
the
little
drawers
inside
it
while
we
were
waiting
to
begin
to
make
the
pudding
it
was
the
grocer
told
us
we
ought
to
put
treacle
in
the
pudding
and
also
about
not
so
much
ginger
as
a
teacupful
when
matilda
had
begun
to
pretend
to
scrub
the
floor
she
pretended
this
three
times
a
week
so
as
to
have
an
excuse
not
to
let
us
in
the
kitchen
but
i
know
she
used
to
read
novelettes
most
of
the
time
because
alice
and
i
had
a
squint
through
the
window
more
than
once
we
barricaded
the
nursery
door
and
set
to
work
we
were
very
careful
to
be
quite
clean
we
washed
our
hands
as
well
as
the
currants
i
have
sometimes
thought
we
did
not
get
all
the
soap
off
the
currants
the
pudding
smelt
like
a
when
the
time
came
to
cut
it
open
and
we
washed
a
corner
of
the
table
to
chop
the
suet
on
chopping
suet
looks
easy
till
you
try
father
machine
he
weighs
letters
with
did
to
weigh
out
the
things
we
did
this
very
carefully
in
case
the
grocer
had
not
done
so
everything
was
right
except
the
raisins
had
carried
them
home
he
was
very
young
then
and
there
was
a
hole
in
the
corner
of
the
paper
bag
and
his
mouth
was
sticky
lots
of
people
have
been
hanged
to
a
gibbet
in
chains
on
evidence
no
worse
than
that
and
we
told
so
till
he
cried
this
was
good
for
him
it
was
not
unkindness
to
but
part
of
our
duty
chopping
suet
as
fine
as
possible
is
much
harder
than
any
one
would
think
as
i
said
before
so
is
crumbling
bread
especially
if
your
loaf
is
new
like
ours
was
when
we
had
done
them
the
breadcrumbs
and
the
suet
were
both
very
large
and
lumpy
and
of
a
dingy
gray
colour
something
like
pale
slate
pencil
they
looked
a
better
colour
when
we
had
mixed
them
with
the
flour
the
girls
had
washed
the
currants
with
brown
windsor
soap
and
the
sponge
some
of
the
currants
got
inside
the
sponge
and
kept
coming
out
in
the
bath
for
days
afterwards
i
see
now
that
this
was
not
quite
nice
we
cut
the
candied
peel
as
thin
as
we
wish
people
would
cut
our
we
tried
to
take
the
stones
out
of
the
raisins
but
they
were
too
sticky
so
we
just
divided
them
up
in
seven
lots
then
we
mixed
the
other
things
in
the
basin
from
the
spare
bedroom
that
was
always
spare
we
each
put
in
our
own
lot
of
raisins
and
turned
it
all
into
a
and
tied
it
up
in
one
of
alice
pinafores
which
was
the
nearest
thing
to
a
proper
we
could
find
at
any
rate
clean
what
was
left
sticking
to
the
basin
did
not
taste
so
bad
it
a
little
bit
soapy
alice
said
but
perhaps
that
will
boil
out
like
stains
in
it
was
a
difficult
question
how
to
boil
the
pudding
matilda
proved
furious
when
asked
to
let
us
just
because
some
one
had
happened
to
knock
her
hat
off
the
scullery
door
and
pincher
had
got
it
and
done
for
it
however
part
of
the
embassy
nicked
a
saucepan
while
the
others
were
being
told
what
matilda
thought
about
the
hat
and
we
got
hot
water
out
of
the
and
made
it
boil
over
our
nursery
fire
we
put
the
pudding
in
it
was
now
getting
on
towards
the
hour
of
tea
and
let
it
boil
with
some
exceptions
owing
to
the
fire
going
down
and
matilda
not
hurrying
up
with
coals
it
boiled
for
an
hour
and
a
quarter
then
matilda
came
suddenly
in
and
said
i
not
going
to
have
you
messing
about
in
here
with
my
saucepans
and
she
tried
to
take
it
off
the
fire
you
will
see
that
we
could
stand
this
it
was
not
likely
i
do
not
remember
who
it
was
that
told
her
to
mind
her
own
business
and
i
think
i
have
forgotten
who
caught
hold
of
her
first
to
make
her
chuck
it
i
am
sure
no
needless
violence
was
used
anyway
while
the
struggle
progressed
alice
and
dora
took
the
saucepan
away
and
put
it
in
the
under
the
stairs
and
put
the
key
in
their
pocket
this
sharp
encounter
made
every
one
very
hot
and
cross
we
got
over
it
before
matilda
did
but
we
brought
her
round
before
bedtime
quarrels
should
always
be
made
up
before
bedtime
it
says
so
in
the
bible
if
this
simple
rule
was
followed
there
would
not
be
so
many
wars
and
martyrs
and
law
suits
and
inquisitions
and
bloody
deaths
at
the
stake
all
the
house
was
still
the
gas
was
out
all
over
the
house
except
on
the
first
landing
when
several
figures
might
have
been
observed
creeping
downstairs
to
the
kitchen
on
the
way
with
superior
precaution
we
got
out
our
saucepan
the
kitchen
fire
was
red
but
low
the
was
locked
and
there
was
nothing
in
the
scuttle
but
a
little
and
the
piece
of
brown
paper
that
is
put
in
to
keep
the
coals
from
tumbling
out
through
the
bottom
where
the
hole
is
we
put
the
saucepan
on
the
fire
and
plied
it
with
fuel
two
a
and
two
novelettes
were
burned
in
vain
i
am
almost
sure
the
pudding
did
not
boil
at
all
that
night
never
mind
alice
said
we
can
each
nick
a
piece
of
coal
every
time
we
go
into
the
kitchen
this
daring
scheme
was
faithfully
performed
and
by
night
we
had
nearly
half
a
basket
of
coal
coke
and
cinders
and
in
the
depth
of
night
once
more
we
might
have
been
observed
this
time
with
our
basket
in
our
guarded
hands
there
was
more
fire
left
in
the
grate
that
night
and
we
fed
it
with
the
fuel
we
had
collected
this
time
the
fire
blazed
up
and
the
pudding
boiled
like
mad
this
was
the
time
it
boiled
two
hours
at
least
i
think
it
was
about
that
but
we
dropped
asleep
on
the
kitchen
tables
and
dresser
you
dare
not
be
lowly
in
the
night
in
the
kitchen
because
of
the
beetles
we
were
aroused
by
a
horrible
smell
it
was
the
burning
all
the
water
had
secretly
boiled
itself
away
we
filled
it
up
at
once
with
cold
and
the
saucepan
cracked
so
we
cleaned
it
and
put
it
back
on
the
shelf
and
took
another
and
went
to
bed
you
see
what
a
lot
of
trouble
we
had
over
the
pudding
every
evening
till
christmas
which
had
now
become
only
the
day
after
we
sneaked
down
in
the
inky
midnight
and
boiled
that
pudding
for
as
long
as
it
would
on
christmas
morning
we
chopped
the
holly
for
the
sauce
but
we
put
hot
water
instead
of
brandy
and
moist
sugar
some
of
them
said
it
was
not
so
bad
oswald
was
not
one
of
these
then
came
the
moment
when
the
plain
pudding
father
had
ordered
smoked
upon
the
board
matilda
brought
it
in
and
went
away
at
once
she
had
a
cousin
out
of
woolwich
arsenal
to
see
her
that
day
i
remember
those
days
are
quite
distinct
in
memory
recollection
still
then
we
got
out
our
own
pudding
from
its
and
gave
it
one
last
hurried
boil
only
seven
minutes
because
of
the
general
impatience
which
oswald
and
dora
could
not
cope
with
we
had
found
means
to
secrete
a
dish
and
we
now
tried
to
dish
the
pudding
up
but
it
stuck
to
the
basin
and
had
to
be
dislodged
with
the
chisel
the
pudding
was
horribly
pale
we
poured
the
holly
sauce
over
it
and
dora
took
up
the
knife
and
was
just
cutting
it
when
a
few
simple
words
from
turned
us
from
happy
and
triumphing
cookery
artists
to
persons
in
despair
he
said
how
pleased
all
those
kind
ladies
and
gentlemen
would
be
if
they
knew
were
the
poor
children
they
gave
the
shillings
and
sixpences
and
things
for
we
all
said
it
was
no
moment
for
politeness
i
say
said
they
be
glad
if
they
knew
it
was
us
was
enjoying
the
pudding
and
not
dirty
little
really
poor
children
you
should
say
were
not
was
said
dora
but
it
was
as
in
a
dream
and
only
from
habit
do
you
mean
to
say
oswald
spoke
firmly
yet
not
angrily
that
you
and
alice
went
and
begged
for
money
for
poor
children
and
then
it
we
did
keep
it
said
we
spent
it
we
kept
the
you
little
duffer
said
dicky
looking
at
the
pudding
sitting
alone
and
uncared
for
on
its
dish
you
begged
for
money
for
poor
children
and
then
it
it
stealing
that
what
it
is
i
do
say
so
much
about
you
you
only
a
silly
kid
but
alice
knew
better
why
did
you
do
it
he
turned
to
alice
but
she
was
now
too
deep
in
tears
to
get
a
word
out
looked
a
bit
frightened
but
he
answered
the
question
we
have
taught
him
this
he
said
i
thought
they
give
us
more
if
i
said
poor
children
than
if
i
said
just
us
cheating
said
dicky
downright
beastly
mean
low
cheating
i
not
said
and
you
another
then
he
began
to
cry
too
i
do
not
know
how
the
others
felt
but
i
understand
from
oswald
that
he
felt
that
now
the
honour
of
the
house
of
bastable
had
been
stamped
on
in
the
dust
and
it
did
matter
what
happened
he
looked
at
the
beastly
holly
that
had
been
left
over
from
the
sauce
and
was
stuck
up
over
the
pictures
it
now
appeared
hollow
and
disgusting
though
it
had
got
quite
a
lot
of
berries
and
some
of
it
was
the
varied
kind
green
and
white
the
figs
and
dates
and
toffee
were
set
out
in
the
dinner
service
the
very
sight
of
it
all
made
oswald
blush
sickly
he
owns
he
would
have
liked
to
cuff
and
if
he
did
for
a
moment
wish
to
shake
alice
the
author
for
one
can
make
allowances
now
alice
choked
and
spluttered
and
wiped
her
eyes
fiercely
and
said
it
no
use
ragging
it
my
fault
i
older
than
he
is
said
it
could
be
alice
fault
i
do
see
as
it
was
wrong
that
not
as
murmured
dora
putting
her
arm
round
the
sinner
who
had
brought
this
degrading
blight
upon
our
family
tree
but
such
is
undetermined
and
affectionate
silliness
tell
sister
all
about
it
dear
why
could
it
be
alice
fault
cuddled
up
to
dora
and
said
snufflingly
in
his
nose
because
she
had
got
nothing
to
do
with
it
i
collected
it
all
she
never
went
into
one
of
the
houses
she
did
want
to
and
then
took
all
the
credit
of
getting
the
money
said
dicky
savagely
oswald
said
not
much
in
scornful
tones
oh
you
are
the
whole
lot
of
you
except
dora
alice
said
stamping
her
foot
in
rage
and
despair
i
tore
my
frock
on
a
nail
going
out
and
i
did
want
to
go
back
and
i
got
to
go
to
the
houses
alone
and
i
waited
for
him
outside
and
i
asked
him
not
to
say
anything
because
i
did
want
dora
to
know
about
the
frock
it
my
best
and
i
do
know
what
he
said
inside
he
never
told
me
but
i
bet
anything
he
did
to
cheat
you
lots
of
kind
people
would
be
ready
to
give
money
to
get
pudding
for
poor
children
so
i
asked
them
to
oswald
with
his
strong
right
hand
waved
a
wave
of
passing
things
over
we
talk
about
that
another
time
he
said
just
now
we
got
weightier
things
to
deal
with
he
pointed
to
the
pudding
which
had
grown
cold
during
the
conversation
to
which
i
have
alluded
stopped
crying
but
alice
went
on
with
it
oswald
now
said
we
a
base
and
outcast
family
until
that
pudding
out
of
the
house
we
sha
be
able
to
look
any
one
in
the
face
we
must
see
that
that
pudding
goes
to
poor
children
not
grisling
grumpy
pretending
poor
children
but
real
poor
ones
just
as
poor
as
they
can
stick
and
the
figs
too
and
the
dates
said
noël
with
regretting
tones
every
fig
said
dicky
sternly
oswald
is
quite
right
this
honourable
resolution
made
us
feel
a
bit
better
we
hastily
put
on
our
best
things
and
washed
ourselves
a
bit
and
hurried
out
to
find
some
really
poor
people
to
give
the
pudding
to
we
cut
it
in
slices
ready
and
put
it
in
a
basket
with
the
figs
and
dates
and
toffee
we
would
not
let
come
with
us
at
first
because
he
wanted
to
and
alice
would
not
come
because
of
him
so
at
last
we
had
to
let
him
the
excitement
of
tearing
into
your
best
things
heals
the
hurt
that
wounded
honour
feels
as
the
poetry
writer
said
or
at
any
rate
it
makes
the
hurt
feel
better
we
went
out
into
the
streets
they
were
pretty
quiet
nearly
everybody
was
eating
its
christmas
dessert
but
presently
we
met
a
woman
in
an
apron
oswald
said
very
politely
please
are
you
a
poor
person
and
she
told
us
to
get
along
with
us
the
next
we
met
was
a
shabby
man
with
a
hole
in
his
left
boot
again
oswald
said
please
are
you
a
poor
person
and
have
you
any
poor
little
children
the
man
told
us
not
to
come
any
of
our
games
with
him
or
we
should
laugh
on
the
wrong
side
of
our
faces
we
went
on
sadly
we
had
no
heart
to
stop
and
explain
to
him
that
we
had
no
games
to
come
the
next
was
a
young
man
near
the
obelisk
dora
tried
this
time
she
said
oh
if
you
please
we
got
some
christmas
pudding
in
this
basket
and
if
you
a
poor
person
you
can
have
some
poor
as
job
said
the
young
man
in
a
hoarse
voice
and
he
had
to
come
up
out
of
a
red
comforter
to
say
it
we
gave
him
a
slice
of
the
pudding
and
he
bit
into
it
without
thanks
or
delay
the
next
minute
he
had
thrown
the
pudding
slap
in
dora
face
and
was
clutching
dicky
by
the
collar
blime
if
i
do
chuck
ye
in
the
river
the
whole
bloomin
lot
of
you
he
exclaimed
the
girls
screamed
the
boys
shouted
and
though
oswald
threw
himself
on
the
insulter
of
his
sister
with
all
his
manly
vigour
yet
but
for
a
friend
of
oswald
who
is
in
the
police
passing
at
that
instant
the
author
shudders
to
think
what
might
have
happened
for
he
was
a
strong
young
man
and
oswald
is
not
yet
come
to
his
full
strength
and
the
quaggy
runs
all
too
near
our
policeman
led
our
assailant
aside
and
we
waited
anxiously
as
he
told
us
to
after
long
uncertain
moments
the
young
man
in
the
comforter
loafed
off
grumbling
and
our
policeman
turned
to
us
said
you
give
him
a
dollop
o
pudding
and
it
tasted
of
soap
and
i
suppose
the
must
have
been
the
brown
windsoriness
of
the
soap
coming
out
we
were
sorry
but
it
was
still
our
duty
to
get
rid
of
the
pudding
the
quaggy
was
handy
it
is
true
but
when
you
have
collected
money
to
feed
poor
children
and
spent
it
on
pudding
it
is
not
right
to
throw
that
pudding
in
the
river
people
do
not
subscribe
shillings
and
sixpences
and
to
feed
a
hungry
flood
with
christmas
pudding
yet
we
shrank
from
asking
any
more
people
whether
they
were
poor
persons
or
about
their
families
and
still
more
from
offering
the
pudding
to
chance
people
who
might
bite
into
it
and
taste
the
soap
before
we
had
time
to
get
away
it
was
alice
the
most
paralysed
with
disgrace
of
all
of
us
who
thought
of
the
best
idea
she
said
let
take
it
to
the
workhouse
at
any
rate
they
all
poor
people
there
and
they
may
go
out
without
leave
so
they
ca
run
after
us
to
do
anything
to
us
after
the
pudding
no
one
would
give
them
leave
to
go
out
to
pursue
people
who
had
brought
them
pudding
and
wreck
vengeance
on
them
and
at
any
rate
we
shall
get
rid
of
the
it
a
sort
of
you
know
only
it
is
money
but
pudding
the
workhouse
is
a
good
way
but
we
stuck
to
it
though
very
cold
and
hungrier
than
we
thought
possible
when
we
started
for
we
had
been
so
agitated
we
had
not
even
stayed
to
eat
the
plain
pudding
our
good
father
had
so
kindly
and
thoughtfully
ordered
for
our
christmas
dinner
the
big
bell
at
the
workhouse
made
a
man
open
the
door
to
us
when
we
rang
it
oswald
said
and
he
spoke
because
he
is
next
eldest
to
dora
and
she
had
had
jolly
well
enough
of
saying
anything
about
pudding
he
said
please
we
brought
some
pudding
for
the
poor
people
he
looked
us
up
and
down
and
he
looked
at
our
basket
then
he
said
you
better
see
the
matron
we
waited
in
a
hall
feeling
more
and
more
uncomfy
and
less
and
less
like
christmas
we
were
very
cold
indeed
especially
our
hands
and
our
noses
and
we
felt
less
and
less
able
to
face
the
matron
if
she
was
horrid
and
one
of
us
at
least
wished
we
had
chosen
the
quaggy
for
the
pudding
long
home
and
made
it
up
to
the
robbed
poor
in
some
other
way
afterwards
just
as
alice
was
saying
earnestly
in
the
burning
cold
ear
of
oswald
let
put
down
the
basket
and
make
a
bolt
for
it
oh
oswald
a
lady
came
along
the
passage
she
was
very
upright
and
she
had
eyes
that
went
through
you
like
blue
gimlets
i
should
not
like
to
be
obliged
to
thwart
that
lady
if
she
had
any
design
and
mine
was
opposite
i
am
glad
this
is
not
likely
to
occur
she
said
what
all
this
about
a
pudding
said
at
once
before
we
could
stop
him
they
say
i
stolen
the
pudding
so
we
brought
it
here
for
the
poor
people
no
we
did
that
was
why
the
money
was
given
it
was
meant
for
the
poor
shut
up
said
the
rest
of
us
all
at
once
then
there
was
an
awful
silence
the
lady
gimleted
us
again
one
by
one
with
her
blue
eyes
then
she
said
come
into
my
room
you
all
look
frozen
she
took
us
into
a
very
jolly
room
with
velvet
curtains
and
a
big
fire
and
the
gas
lighted
because
now
it
was
almost
dark
even
out
of
doors
she
gave
us
chairs
and
oswald
felt
as
if
his
was
a
dock
he
felt
so
criminal
and
the
lady
looked
so
judgular
then
she
took
the
by
the
fire
herself
and
said
who
the
eldest
i
am
said
dora
looking
more
like
a
frightened
white
rabbit
than
ever
seen
her
then
tell
me
all
about
it
dora
looked
at
alice
and
began
to
cry
that
slab
of
pudding
in
the
face
had
totally
unnerved
the
gentle
girl
alice
eyes
were
red
and
her
face
was
puffy
with
crying
but
she
spoke
up
for
dora
and
said
oh
please
let
oswald
tell
dora
ca
she
tired
with
the
long
walk
and
a
young
man
threw
a
piece
of
it
in
her
face
and
the
lady
nodded
and
oswald
began
he
told
the
story
from
the
very
beginning
as
he
has
always
been
taught
to
though
he
hated
to
lay
bare
the
family
honour
wound
before
a
stranger
however
judgelike
and
he
told
all
not
concealing
the
nor
what
the
young
man
said
about
soap
so
he
ended
we
want
to
give
the
to
you
like
you
know
what
that
is
do
you
but
if
you
really
think
it
is
soapy
and
not
just
the
young
man
horridness
perhaps
you
better
not
let
them
eat
it
but
the
figs
and
things
are
all
right
when
he
had
done
the
lady
said
for
most
of
us
were
crying
more
or
less
come
cheer
up
it
and
he
very
little
your
brother
i
mean
and
i
think
the
rest
of
you
seem
pretty
well
able
to
take
care
of
the
honour
of
the
family
i
take
the
off
your
minds
where
are
you
going
now
home
i
suppose
oswald
said
and
he
thought
how
nasty
and
dark
and
dull
it
would
be
the
fire
out
most
likely
and
father
away
and
your
father
not
at
home
you
say
the
lady
went
on
what
do
you
say
to
having
tea
with
me
and
then
seeing
the
entertainment
we
have
got
up
for
our
old
people
then
the
lady
smiled
and
the
blue
gimlets
looked
quite
merry
the
room
was
so
warm
and
comfortable
and
the
invitation
was
the
last
thing
we
expected
it
was
jolly
of
her
i
do
think
no
one
thought
quite
at
first
of
saying
how
pleased
we
should
be
to
accept
her
kind
invitation
instead
we
all
just
said
oh
but
in
a
tone
which
must
have
told
her
we
meant
yes
please
very
deeply
oswald
this
has
more
than
once
happened
was
the
first
to
restore
his
manners
he
made
a
proper
bow
like
he
has
been
taught
and
said
thank
you
very
much
we
should
like
it
very
much
it
is
very
much
nicer
than
going
home
thank
you
very
much
i
need
not
tell
the
reader
that
oswald
could
have
made
up
a
much
better
speech
if
he
had
had
more
time
to
make
it
up
in
or
if
he
had
not
been
so
filled
with
mixed
flusteredness
and
furification
by
the
shameful
events
of
the
day
we
washed
our
faces
and
hands
and
had
a
first
rate
muffin
and
crumpet
tea
with
slices
of
cold
meats
and
many
nice
jams
and
cakes
a
lot
of
other
people
were
there
most
of
them
people
who
were
giving
the
entertainment
to
the
aged
poor
after
tea
it
was
the
entertainment
songs
and
conjuring
and
a
play
called
box
and
cox
very
amusing
and
a
lot
of
throwing
things
about
in
it
bacon
and
chops
and
things
and
nigger
minstrels
we
clapped
till
our
hands
were
sore
when
it
was
over
we
said
goodbye
in
between
the
songs
and
things
oswald
had
had
time
to
make
up
a
speech
of
thanks
to
the
lady
he
said
we
all
thank
you
heartily
for
your
goodness
the
entertainment
was
beautiful
we
shall
never
forget
your
kindness
and
hospitableness
the
lady
laughed
and
said
she
had
been
very
pleased
to
have
us
a
fat
gentleman
said
and
your
teas
i
hope
you
enjoyed
those
eh
oswald
had
not
had
time
to
make
up
an
answer
to
that
so
he
answered
straight
from
the
heart
and
said
ra
and
every
one
laughed
and
slapped
us
boys
on
the
back
and
kissed
the
girls
and
the
gentleman
who
played
the
bones
in
the
nigger
minstrels
saw
us
home
we
ate
the
cold
pudding
that
night
and
dreamed
that
something
came
to
eat
him
like
it
advises
you
to
in
the
advertisements
on
the
hoardings
the
said
it
was
the
pudding
but
i
think
it
could
have
been
that
because
as
i
have
said
more
than
once
it
was
so
very
plain
some
of
brothers
and
sisters
thought
it
was
a
judgment
on
him
for
pretending
about
who
the
poor
children
were
he
was
collecting
the
money
for
oswald
does
not
believe
such
a
little
boy
as
would
have
a
real
judgment
made
just
for
him
and
nobody
else
whatever
he
did
but
it
certainly
is
odd
was
the
only
one
who
had
bad
dreams
and
he
was
also
the
only
one
who
got
any
of
the
things
we
bought
with
that
money
because
you
remember
he
picked
a
hole
in
the
as
he
was
bringing
the
parcel
home
the
rest
of
us
had
nothing
unless
you
count
the
scrapings
of
the
and
those
do
really
count
at
all
the
the
house
of
bastable
was
once
in
poor
but
honest
circs
that
was
when
it
lived
in
a
house
in
the
lewisham
road
and
looked
for
treasure
there
were
six
scions
of
the
house
who
looked
for
it
in
fact
there
were
seven
if
you
count
father
i
am
sure
he
looked
right
enough
but
he
did
not
do
it
the
right
way
and
we
did
and
so
we
found
a
treasure
of
a
and
we
and
father
went
to
live
with
him
in
a
very
affluent
mansion
on
blackheath
with
gardens
and
vineries
and
pineries
and
everything
jolly
you
can
think
of
and
then
when
we
were
no
longer
so
beastly
short
of
we
tried
to
be
good
and
sometimes
it
came
out
right
and
sometimes
it
did
something
like
sums
and
then
it
was
the
christmas
holidays
and
we
had
a
bazaar
and
raffled
the
most
beautiful
goat
you
ever
saw
and
we
gave
the
money
to
the
poor
and
needy
and
then
we
felt
it
was
time
to
do
something
new
because
we
were
as
rich
as
our
worthy
relative
the
uncle
and
our
father
now
also
wealthy
at
least
compared
to
what
he
used
to
be
thought
right
for
us
and
we
were
as
good
as
we
could
be
without
being
good
for
nothing
and
muffs
which
i
hope
no
one
calling
itself
a
bastable
will
ever
stoop
to
so
then
oswald
so
often
the
leader
in
hazardous
enterprises
thought
long
and
deeply
in
his
interior
self
and
he
saw
that
something
must
be
done
because
though
there
was
still
the
goat
left
over
unclaimed
by
its
fortunate
winner
at
the
bazaar
somehow
no
really
fine
idea
seemed
to
come
out
of
it
and
nothing
else
was
happening
dora
was
getting
a
bit
domineering
and
alice
was
too
much
taken
up
with
trying
to
learn
to
knit
dicky
was
bored
and
so
was
oswald
and
noël
was
writing
far
more
poetry
than
could
be
healthy
for
any
poet
however
young
and
was
simply
a
nuisance
his
boots
are
always
much
louder
when
he
is
not
amused
and
that
gets
the
rest
of
us
into
rows
because
there
are
hardly
any
persons
who
can
tell
the
difference
between
his
boots
and
mine
oswald
decided
to
call
a
council
because
even
if
nothing
comes
of
a
council
it
always
means
getting
alice
to
drop
knitting
and
making
noël
chuck
the
poetical
influences
that
are
no
use
and
only
make
him
silly
and
he
went
into
the
room
that
is
our
room
it
is
called
the
like
in
colleges
and
it
is
very
different
from
the
room
that
was
ours
when
we
were
poor
but
honest
it
is
a
jolly
room
with
a
big
table
and
a
big
couch
that
is
most
useful
for
games
and
a
thick
carpet
because
of
boots
alice
was
knitting
by
the
fire
it
was
for
father
but
i
am
sure
his
feet
are
not
at
all
that
shape
he
has
a
high
and
beautifully
formed
instep
like
oswald
noël
was
writing
poetry
of
course
my
dear
sister
sits
and
knits
i
hope
to
goodness
the
stocking
fits
was
as
far
as
he
had
got
it
ought
to
be
dearest
sister
to
sound
right
he
said
but
that
would
be
kind
to
dora
thank
you
said
dora
you
need
trouble
to
be
kind
to
me
if
you
do
want
to
shut
up
dora
said
dicky
noël
did
mean
anything
he
never
does
said
nor
yet
his
poetry
does
neither
his
poetry
does
dora
corrected
and
besides
you
ought
to
say
that
at
all
it
unkind
you
too
jolly
down
on
the
kid
said
dicky
and
alice
said
oh
do
be
quiet
half
a
sec
ninety
now
i
shall
have
to
count
the
stitches
all
over
again
oswald
alone
was
silent
and
not
cross
i
tell
you
this
to
show
that
the
sort
of
worryingness
was
among
us
that
is
catching
like
measles
kipling
calls
it
the
cameelious
hump
and
as
usual
that
great
and
good
writer
is
quite
correct
so
oswald
said
look
here
let
have
a
council
it
says
in
book
when
you
got
the
hump
go
and
dig
till
you
gently
perspire
well
we
ca
do
that
because
it
simply
pouring
but
the
others
all
interrupted
him
and
said
they
had
got
the
hump
and
they
did
know
what
he
meant
so
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
patiently
it
is
not
his
fault
that
the
others
hate
him
to
shrug
his
shoulders
patiently
and
he
said
no
more
then
dora
said
oh
do
be
so
disagreeable
oswald
for
sake
i
assure
you
she
did
though
he
had
done
simply
nothing
matters
were
in
this
cryptical
state
when
the
door
opened
and
father
came
in
hullo
kiddies
he
remarked
kindly
beastly
wet
day
is
it
and
dark
too
i
ca
think
why
the
rain
ca
always
come
in
term
time
it
seems
a
poor
arrangement
to
have
it
in
does
it
i
think
every
one
instantly
felt
better
i
know
one
of
us
did
and
it
was
me
father
lit
the
gas
and
sat
down
in
the
armchair
and
took
alice
on
his
knee
first
he
said
here
is
a
box
of
chocs
it
was
an
extra
big
and
beautiful
one
and
fuller
best
and
besides
the
a
piece
of
good
news
you
all
asked
to
a
party
at
leslie
she
going
to
have
all
sorts
of
games
and
things
with
prizes
for
every
one
and
a
conjurer
and
a
magic
lantern
the
shadow
of
doom
seemed
to
be
lifted
from
each
young
brow
and
we
felt
how
much
fonder
we
were
of
each
other
than
any
one
would
have
thought
at
least
oswald
felt
this
and
dicky
told
me
afterwards
he
felt
dora
was
such
a
bad
sort
after
all
it
on
tuesday
week
said
father
i
see
the
prospect
pleases
number
three
is
that
your
cousin
archibald
has
come
here
to
stay
a
week
or
two
his
little
sister
has
taken
it
into
her
head
to
have
and
he
downstairs
now
talking
to
your
uncle
we
asked
what
the
young
stranger
was
like
but
father
did
not
know
because
he
and
cousin
archibald
father
had
not
seen
much
of
each
other
for
some
years
father
said
this
but
we
knew
it
was
because
father
had
bothered
to
see
ours
when
he
was
poor
and
honest
but
now
he
was
the
wealthy
sharer
of
the
beautiful
blackheath
house
it
was
different
this
made
us
not
like
uncle
archibald
very
much
but
we
were
too
just
to
blame
it
on
to
young
archibald
all
the
same
we
should
have
liked
him
better
if
his
father
previous
career
had
not
been
of
such
a
worldly
and
sort
besides
i
do
think
archibald
is
quite
the
most
rotten
sort
of
name
we
should
have
called
him
archie
of
course
if
he
had
been
at
all
decent
you
be
as
jolly
to
him
as
you
can
i
know
father
said
he
a
bit
older
than
you
oswald
he
not
a
chap
then
father
went
down
and
oswald
had
to
go
with
him
and
there
was
archibald
sitting
upright
in
a
chair
and
talking
to
our
indian
uncle
as
if
he
was
some
beastly
our
cousin
proved
to
be
dark
and
rather
tall
and
though
he
was
only
fourteen
he
was
always
stroking
his
lip
to
see
if
his
moustache
had
begun
to
come
father
introduced
us
to
each
other
and
we
said
how
do
you
do
and
looked
at
each
other
and
neither
of
us
could
think
of
anything
else
to
say
at
least
oswald
could
so
then
we
went
upstairs
archibald
shook
hands
with
the
others
and
every
one
was
silent
except
dora
and
she
only
whispered
to
to
keep
his
feet
still
you
can
not
keep
for
ever
in
melancholy
silence
however
few
things
you
have
to
say
and
presently
some
one
said
it
was
a
wet
day
and
this
remark
made
us
able
to
begin
to
talk
i
do
not
wish
to
be
injurious
to
anybody
especially
one
who
was
a
bastable
by
birth
at
least
if
not
according
to
the
nobler
attributes
but
i
must
say
that
oswald
never
did
dislike
a
boy
so
much
as
he
did
that
young
archibald
he
was
as
cocky
as
though
he
done
something
to
speak
of
been
captain
of
his
eleven
or
passed
a
beastly
or
something
but
we
never
could
find
that
he
had
done
anything
he
was
always
bragging
about
the
things
he
had
at
home
and
the
things
he
was
allowed
to
do
and
all
the
things
he
knew
all
about
but
he
was
a
most
untruthful
chap
he
laughed
at
noël
being
a
poet
a
thing
we
never
do
because
it
makes
him
cry
and
crying
makes
him
ill
and
of
course
oswald
and
dicky
could
not
punch
his
head
in
their
own
house
because
of
the
laws
of
hospitableness
and
alice
stopped
it
at
last
by
saying
she
did
care
if
it
was
being
a
sneak
she
would
tell
father
the
very
next
time
i
do
think
she
would
have
because
we
made
a
rule
when
we
were
poor
and
honest
not
to
bother
father
if
we
could
possibly
help
it
and
we
keep
it
up
still
but
archibald
did
know
that
then
this
cousin
who
is
i
fear
the
black
sheep
of
the
bastables
and
hardly
worthy
to
be
called
one
used
to
pull
the
girls
hair
and
pinch
them
at
prayers
when
they
could
not
call
out
or
do
anything
to
him
back
and
he
was
awfully
rude
to
the
servants
ordering
them
about
and
playing
tricks
on
them
not
amusing
tricks
like
other
bastables
might
have
done
such
as
and
mice
under
which
seldom
leaves
any
lasting
but
things
no
decent
boy
would
do
like
hiding
their
letters
and
not
giving
them
to
them
for
days
and
then
it
was
too
late
to
meet
the
young
man
the
letter
was
from
and
squirting
ink
on
their
aprons
when
they
were
just
going
to
open
the
door
and
once
he
put
a
in
the
cook
pocket
when
she
was
looking
he
did
not
do
anything
to
oswald
at
that
time
i
suppose
he
was
afraid
i
just
tell
you
this
to
show
you
that
oswald
did
cotton
to
him
for
no
selfish
reason
but
because
oswald
has
been
taught
to
feel
for
others
illustration
and
he
was
awfully
rude
to
the
servants
he
called
us
all
kids
and
he
was
that
kind
of
boy
we
knew
at
once
it
was
no
good
trying
to
start
anything
new
and
jolly
so
oswald
ever
discreet
and
wary
shut
up
entirely
about
the
council
we
played
games
with
him
sometimes
not
really
good
ones
but
snap
and
beggar
my
neighbour
and
even
then
he
used
to
cheat
i
hate
to
say
it
of
one
of
our
blood
but
i
can
hardly
believe
he
was
i
think
he
must
have
been
changed
at
nurse
like
the
heirs
to
monarchies
and
dukeries
well
the
days
passed
slowly
there
was
leslie
party
shining
starrishly
in
the
mysteries
of
the
future
also
we
had
another
thing
to
look
forward
to
and
that
was
when
archibald
would
have
to
go
back
to
school
but
we
could
not
enjoy
that
foreshadowing
so
much
because
of
us
having
to
go
back
at
nearly
the
same
time
oswald
always
tries
to
be
just
no
matter
how
far
from
easy
and
so
i
will
say
that
i
am
not
quite
sure
that
it
was
archibald
that
set
the
pipes
leaking
but
we
were
all
up
in
the
loft
the
day
before
snatching
a
golden
opportunity
to
play
a
brief
game
of
robbers
in
a
cave
while
archibald
had
gone
down
to
the
village
to
get
his
silly
hair
cut
another
thing
about
him
that
was
not
natural
was
his
being
always
looking
in
the
glass
and
wanting
to
talk
about
whether
people
were
handsome
or
not
and
he
made
as
much
fuss
about
his
ties
as
though
he
had
been
a
girl
so
when
he
was
gone
alice
said
hist
the
golden
moment
let
be
robbers
in
the
loft
and
when
he
comes
back
he
wo
know
where
we
are
he
hear
us
said
noël
biting
his
pencil
no
he
wo
we
be
the
whispering
band
of
weird
bandits
come
on
noël
you
can
finish
the
poetry
up
here
it
about
said
noël
gloomily
when
he
gone
back
to
oswald
will
not
give
the
name
of
archibald
school
for
the
sake
of
the
other
boys
there
as
they
might
not
like
everybody
who
reads
this
to
know
about
there
being
a
chap
like
him
in
their
midst
i
shall
do
it
up
in
an
envelope
and
put
a
stamp
on
it
and
post
it
to
him
and
haste
cried
alice
bard
of
the
bandits
haste
while
yet
time
so
we
tore
upstairs
and
put
on
our
slippers
and
socks
over
them
and
we
got
the
chair
out
of
the
girls
bedroom
and
the
others
held
it
steady
while
oswald
agilitively
mounted
upon
its
high
back
and
opened
the
and
got
up
into
the
place
between
the
roof
and
the
ceiling
the
boys
in
stalky
found
this
out
by
accident
and
they
were
surprised
and
pleased
but
we
have
known
all
about
it
ever
since
we
can
remember
then
the
others
put
the
chair
back
and
oswald
let
down
the
rope
ladder
that
we
made
out
of
bamboo
and
after
uncle
told
us
the
story
of
the
missionary
lady
who
was
shut
up
in
a
rajah
palace
and
some
one
shot
an
arrow
to
her
with
a
string
tied
to
it
and
it
might
have
killed
her
i
should
have
thought
but
it
did
and
she
hauled
in
the
string
and
there
was
a
rope
and
a
bamboo
ladder
and
so
she
escaped
and
we
made
one
like
it
on
purpose
for
the
loft
no
one
had
ever
told
us
not
to
make
ladders
the
others
came
up
by
the
it
was
partly
bamboo
but
does
for
short
and
we
shut
the
down
it
is
jolly
up
there
there
are
two
big
cisterns
and
one
little
window
in
a
gable
that
gives
you
just
enough
light
the
floor
is
plaster
with
wooden
things
going
across
beams
and
joists
they
are
called
there
are
some
planks
laid
on
top
of
these
here
and
there
of
course
if
you
walk
on
the
plaster
you
will
go
through
with
your
foot
into
the
room
below
we
had
a
very
jolly
game
in
whispers
and
noël
sat
by
the
little
window
and
was
quite
happy
being
the
bandit
bard
the
cisterns
are
rocks
you
hide
behind
but
the
jolliest
part
was
when
we
heard
archibald
shouting
out
hullo
kids
where
are
you
and
we
all
stayed
as
still
as
mice
and
heard
jane
say
she
thought
we
must
have
gone
out
jane
was
the
one
that
had
got
her
letter
as
well
as
having
her
apron
inked
all
over
illustration
the
others
came
up
by
the
then
we
heard
archibald
going
all
over
the
house
looking
for
us
father
was
at
business
and
uncle
was
at
his
club
and
we
were
and
so
archibald
was
all
alone
and
we
might
have
gone
on
for
hours
enjoying
the
spectacle
of
his
confusion
and
perplexedness
but
noël
happened
to
sneeze
the
least
thing
gives
him
cold
and
he
sneezes
louder
for
his
age
than
any
one
i
know
just
when
archibald
was
on
the
landing
underneath
then
he
stood
there
and
said
i
know
where
you
are
let
me
come
up
we
cautiously
did
not
reply
then
he
said
all
right
i
go
and
get
the
we
did
not
wish
this
we
had
not
been
told
not
to
make
nor
yet
about
not
playing
in
the
loft
but
if
he
fetched
the
jane
would
know
and
there
are
some
secrets
you
like
to
keep
to
yourself
so
oswald
opened
the
and
squinted
down
and
there
was
that
archibald
with
his
beastly
hair
cut
oswald
said
we
let
you
up
if
you
promise
not
to
tell
you
been
up
here
so
he
promised
and
we
let
down
the
and
it
will
show
you
the
kind
of
boy
he
was
that
the
instant
he
had
got
up
by
it
he
began
to
find
fault
with
the
way
it
was
made
illustration
so
oswald
opened
the
and
squinted
down
and
there
was
that
archibald
then
he
wanted
to
play
with
the
but
oswald
knows
it
is
better
not
to
do
this
i
daresay
forbidden
archibald
said
little
kids
like
you
but
know
all
about
plumbing
and
oswald
could
not
prevent
his
fiddling
with
the
pipes
and
the
a
little
then
we
went
down
all
chance
of
further
banditry
was
at
an
end
next
day
was
sunday
the
leak
was
noticed
then
it
was
slow
but
steady
and
the
plumber
was
sent
for
on
monday
morning
oswald
does
not
know
whether
it
was
archibald
who
made
the
leak
but
he
does
know
about
what
came
after
i
think
our
displeasing
cousin
found
that
piece
of
poetry
that
noël
was
beginning
about
him
and
read
it
because
he
is
a
sneak
instead
of
having
it
out
with
noël
he
sucked
up
to
him
and
gave
him
a
which
noël
liked
although
it
is
really
no
good
for
him
to
try
to
write
poetry
with
anything
but
a
pencil
because
he
always
sucks
whatever
he
writes
with
and
ink
is
poisonous
i
believe
then
in
the
afternoon
he
and
noël
got
quite
thick
and
went
off
together
and
afterwards
noël
seemed
very
peacocky
about
something
but
he
would
not
say
what
and
archibald
was
grinning
in
a
way
oswald
would
have
liked
to
pound
his
head
for
then
quite
suddenly
the
peaceable
quietness
of
that
happy
blackheath
home
was
brought
to
a
close
by
screams
servants
ran
about
with
brooms
and
pails
and
the
water
was
coming
through
the
ceiling
of
uncle
room
like
mad
and
noël
turned
white
and
looked
at
our
unattractive
cousin
and
said
send
him
away
alice
put
her
arm
round
noël
and
said
do
go
archibald
but
he
would
so
then
noël
said
he
wished
he
had
never
been
born
and
whatever
would
father
say
why
what
is
it
noël
alice
asked
that
just
tell
us
we
all
stand
by
you
what
he
been
doing
you
wo
let
him
do
anything
to
me
if
i
tell
tell
tale
tit
said
archibald
he
got
me
to
go
up
into
the
loft
and
he
said
it
was
a
secret
and
would
i
promise
not
to
tell
and
i
wo
tell
only
i
done
it
and
now
the
water
coming
in
you
done
it
you
young
ass
i
was
only
kidding
you
said
our
detestable
cousin
and
he
laughed
i
do
understand
said
oswald
what
did
you
tell
noël
he
ca
tell
you
because
he
promised
and
i
wo
unless
you
vow
by
the
honour
of
the
house
you
talk
so
much
about
that
you
never
tell
i
had
anything
to
do
with
it
that
will
show
you
what
he
was
we
had
never
mentioned
the
honour
of
the
house
except
once
quite
at
the
beginning
before
we
knew
how
discapable
he
was
of
understanding
anything
and
how
far
we
were
from
wanting
to
call
him
archie
we
had
to
promise
for
noël
was
getting
greener
and
more
gurgly
every
minute
and
at
any
moment
father
or
uncle
might
burst
in
foaming
for
an
explanation
and
none
of
us
would
have
one
except
noël
and
him
in
this
state
of
so
dicky
said
we
promise
you
beast
you
and
we
all
said
the
same
then
archibald
said
drawling
his
words
and
feeling
for
the
moustache
that
was
there
and
i
hope
he
be
quite
old
before
he
gets
one
it
just
what
comes
of
trying
to
amuse
silly
little
kids
i
told
the
foolish
little
animal
about
people
having
arteries
cut
and
your
having
to
cut
the
whole
thing
to
stop
the
bleeding
and
he
said
that
what
the
plumber
would
do
to
the
leaky
pipe
and
how
pleased
your
governor
would
be
to
find
it
mended
and
then
he
went
and
did
it
you
told
me
to
said
noël
turning
greener
and
greener
go
along
with
alice
said
oswald
we
stand
by
you
and
noël
old
chap
you
must
keep
your
word
and
not
sneak
about
that
sneaking
hound
alice
took
him
away
and
we
were
left
with
the
horrid
archibald
now
said
oswald
i
wo
break
my
word
no
more
will
the
rest
of
us
but
we
wo
speak
another
word
to
you
as
long
as
we
live
oh
oswald
said
dora
what
about
the
sun
going
down
let
it
jolly
well
go
said
dicky
in
furiousness
oswald
did
say
we
go
on
being
angry
for
ever
but
i
with
oswald
all
the
way
i
wo
talk
to
cads
no
not
even
before
they
can
jolly
well
think
what
they
like
after
this
no
one
spoke
to
archibald
oswald
rushed
for
a
plumber
and
such
was
his
fiery
eloquence
he
really
caught
one
and
brought
him
home
then
he
and
dicky
waited
for
father
when
he
came
in
and
they
got
him
into
the
study
and
oswald
said
what
they
had
all
agreed
on
it
was
this
father
we
are
all
most
awfully
sorry
but
one
of
us
has
cut
the
pipe
in
the
loft
and
if
you
make
us
tell
you
any
more
it
will
not
be
honourable
and
we
are
very
sorry
please
please
do
ask
who
it
was
did
it
father
bit
his
moustache
and
looked
worried
and
dicky
went
on
oswald
has
got
a
plumber
and
he
is
doing
it
now
then
father
said
how
on
earth
did
you
get
into
the
loft
and
then
of
course
the
treasured
secret
of
the
had
to
be
revealed
we
had
never
been
told
not
to
make
and
go
into
the
loft
but
we
did
not
try
to
soften
the
anger
of
our
father
by
saying
this
it
would
not
have
been
any
good
either
we
just
had
to
stick
it
and
the
punishment
of
our
crime
was
most
awful
it
was
that
we
to
go
to
leslie
party
and
archibald
was
to
go
because
when
father
asked
him
if
he
was
in
it
with
the
rest
of
us
he
said
no
i
can
not
think
of
any
really
gentle
manly
and
proper
words
to
say
what
i
think
about
my
unnatural
cousin
we
kept
our
word
about
not
speaking
to
him
and
i
think
father
thought
we
were
jealous
because
he
was
going
to
that
conjuring
magic
lantern
party
and
we
were
not
noël
was
the
most
unhappy
because
he
knew
we
were
all
being
punished
for
what
he
had
done
he
was
very
affectionate
and
tried
to
write
pieces
of
poetry
to
us
all
but
he
was
so
unhappy
he
could
even
write
and
he
went
into
the
kitchen
and
sat
on
jane
knee
and
said
his
head
ached
next
day
it
was
the
day
of
the
party
and
we
were
plunged
in
gloom
archibald
got
out
his
etons
and
put
his
clean
shirt
ready
and
a
pair
of
flashy
silk
socks
with
red
spots
and
then
he
went
into
the
noël
and
jane
were
whispering
on
the
stairs
jane
came
up
and
noël
went
down
jane
knocked
at
the
door
and
said
here
the
soap
master
archerbald
i
did
put
none
in
he
opened
the
door
and
put
out
his
hand
half
a
moment
said
jane
i
got
something
else
in
my
hand
as
she
spoke
the
gas
all
over
the
house
went
down
blue
and
then
went
out
we
held
our
breaths
heavily
here
it
is
she
said
i
put
it
in
your
hand
i
go
down
and
turn
off
the
burners
and
see
about
the
gas
you
be
late
sir
if
i
was
you
i
should
get
on
a
bit
with
the
washing
of
myself
in
the
dark
i
daresay
the
gas
be
five
or
ten
minutes
and
it
five
now
it
was
and
of
course
she
ought
not
to
have
said
it
but
it
was
useful
all
the
same
noël
came
stumping
up
the
stairs
in
the
dark
he
fumbled
about
and
then
whispered
i
turned
the
little
white
china
knob
that
locks
the
door
on
the
outside
the
water
was
bubbling
and
hissing
in
the
pipes
inside
and
the
darkness
went
on
father
and
uncle
had
not
come
in
yet
which
was
a
fortunate
blessing
do
be
quiet
said
noël
just
you
wait
we
all
sat
on
the
stairs
and
waited
noël
said
do
ask
me
yet
you
see
you
wait
and
we
waited
and
the
gas
did
not
come
back
at
last
archibald
tried
to
come
out
he
thought
he
had
washed
himself
clean
i
suppose
and
of
course
the
door
was
fastened
he
kicked
and
he
hammered
and
he
shouted
and
we
were
glad
at
last
noël
banged
on
the
door
and
screamed
through
the
keyhole
if
we
let
you
out
will
you
let
us
off
our
promise
not
to
tell
about
you
and
the
pipes
we
wo
tell
till
you
gone
back
to
school
he
would
for
a
long
time
but
at
last
he
had
to
i
sha
ever
come
to
your
beastly
house
again
he
bellowed
through
the
keyhole
so
i
do
mind
turn
off
the
then
said
oswald
ever
thoughtful
though
he
was
still
in
ignorance
of
the
beautiful
truth
then
noël
sang
out
over
the
stairs
light
up
and
jane
went
round
with
a
taper
and
when
the
landing
gas
was
lighted
noël
turned
the
knob
of
the
and
archibald
exited
in
his
indian
red
and
yellow
that
he
thought
so
much
of
of
course
we
expected
his
face
to
be
red
with
rage
or
white
with
passion
or
purple
with
mixed
emotions
but
you
can
not
think
what
our
feelings
were
indeed
we
hardly
knew
what
they
were
ourselves
when
we
saw
that
he
was
not
red
or
white
or
purple
but
he
looked
like
an
uneven
sort
of
bluish
nigger
his
face
and
hands
were
all
black
and
blue
in
streaks
and
so
were
the
bits
of
his
feet
that
showed
between
his
indian
and
his
turkish
slippers
illustration
what
are
you
staring
at
he
asked
nyang
nyang
jane
answered
tauntingly
the
word
krikey
fell
from
more
than
one
lip
what
are
you
staring
at
he
asked
we
did
not
answer
even
then
though
i
think
it
was
less
from
than
amazement
but
jane
did
nyang
nyang
she
uttered
tauntingly
you
thought
it
was
soap
i
was
giving
you
and
all
the
time
it
was
maple
dark
bright
indelible
dye
wo
wash
out
she
flashed
a
in
his
face
and
he
looked
and
saw
the
depth
of
his
dark
bright
now
you
may
think
that
we
shouted
with
laughing
to
see
him
done
brown
and
dyed
blue
like
this
but
we
did
not
there
was
a
spellbound
silence
oswald
i
know
felt
a
quite
uncomfortable
feeling
inside
him
when
archibald
had
had
one
good
look
at
himself
he
did
not
want
any
more
he
ran
to
his
room
and
bolted
himself
in
wo
go
to
no
parties
said
jane
and
she
flounced
downstairs
we
never
knew
how
much
noël
had
told
her
he
is
very
young
and
not
so
strong
as
we
are
and
we
thought
it
better
not
to
ask
oswald
and
dicky
and
particularly
told
each
other
it
served
him
right
but
after
a
bit
dora
asked
noël
if
he
would
mind
her
trying
to
get
some
of
it
off
our
unloved
cousin
and
he
said
no
illustration
when
father
came
home
there
was
an
awful
row
but
nothing
would
get
it
off
him
and
when
father
came
home
there
was
an
awful
row
and
he
said
we
had
disgraced
ourselves
and
forgotten
the
duties
of
hospitality
we
got
it
pretty
straight
i
can
tell
you
and
we
bore
it
all
i
do
not
say
we
were
martyrs
to
the
honour
of
our
house
and
to
our
plighted
word
but
i
do
say
that
we
got
it
very
straight
indeed
and
we
did
not
tell
the
provocativeness
we
had
had
from
our
guest
that
drove
the
poet
noël
to
this
wild
and
desperate
revenge
but
some
one
told
and
i
have
always
thought
it
was
jane
and
that
is
why
we
did
not
ask
too
many
questions
about
what
noël
had
told
her
because
late
that
night
father
came
and
said
he
now
understood
that
we
had
meant
to
do
right
except
perhaps
the
one
who
cut
the
pipe
with
a
chisel
and
that
must
have
been
more
silliness
than
naughtiness
and
perhaps
the
being
dyed
blue
served
our
cousin
rather
right
and
he
gave
archibald
a
few
remarks
in
private
and
when
the
dye
began
to
come
off
it
was
not
a
fast
dye
though
it
said
so
on
the
paper
it
was
wrapped
in
archibald
now
a
light
streaky
blue
really
did
seem
to
be
making
an
effort
to
be
something
like
decent
and
when
now
merely
a
pale
grey
he
had
returned
to
school
he
sent
us
a
letter
it
said
dear
think
that
i
was
beastlier
than
i
meant
to
be
but
i
am
not
accustomed
to
young
kids
and
i
think
uncle
was
right
and
the
way
you
stand
up
for
the
honour
of
our
house
is
not
all
nonsense
like
i
said
it
was
if
we
ever
meet
in
the
future
life
i
hope
you
will
not
keep
a
down
on
me
about
things
i
do
think
you
can
expect
me
to
say
more
from
your
affectionate
cousin
so
i
suppose
rays
of
remorse
penetrated
that
cold
heart
and
now
perhaps
he
will
be
a
reformed
bastable
i
am
sure
i
hope
so
but
i
believe
it
is
difficult
if
not
impossible
for
a
leopard
to
change
his
skin
still
i
remember
how
indelibly
black
he
looked
when
he
came
out
of
the
fatal
and
it
nearly
all
wore
off
and
perhaps
spots
on
the
honourable
inside
parts
of
your
soul
come
off
with
time
i
hope
so
the
dye
never
came
off
the
inside
of
the
bath
though
i
think
that
was
what
annoyed
our
good
the
most
the
water
to
oswald
is
a
very
modest
boy
i
believe
but
even
he
would
not
deny
that
he
has
an
active
brain
the
author
has
heard
both
his
father
and
albert
uncle
say
so
and
the
most
ideas
often
come
to
him
quite
naturally
just
as
silly
notions
that
are
any
good
might
come
to
you
and
he
had
an
idea
which
he
meant
to
hold
a
council
about
with
his
brothers
and
sisters
but
just
as
he
was
going
to
unroll
his
idea
to
them
our
father
occurred
suddenly
in
our
midst
and
said
a
strange
cousin
was
coming
and
he
came
and
he
was
strange
indeed
and
when
fate
had
woven
the
threads
of
his
dark
destiny
and
he
had
been
dyed
a
dark
bright
and
had
gone
from
our
midst
oswald
went
back
to
the
idea
that
he
had
not
forgotten
the
words
tenacious
of
purpose
mean
sticking
to
things
and
these
words
always
make
me
think
of
the
character
of
the
young
hero
of
these
pages
at
least
i
suppose
his
brothers
dicky
and
noël
and
are
heroes
too
in
a
way
but
somehow
the
author
of
these
lines
knows
more
about
oswald
inside
realness
than
he
does
about
the
others
but
i
am
getting
too
deep
for
words
so
oswald
went
into
the
every
one
was
busy
noël
and
were
playing
halma
dora
was
covering
boxes
with
silver
paper
to
put
sweets
in
for
a
school
treat
and
dicky
was
making
a
cardboard
model
of
a
new
screw
he
has
invented
for
ocean
steamers
but
oswald
did
not
mind
interrupting
because
dora
ought
not
to
work
too
hard
and
halma
always
ends
in
a
row
and
i
would
rather
not
say
what
i
think
of
dicky
screw
so
oswald
said
i
want
a
council
where
alice
every
one
said
they
did
know
and
they
made
haste
to
say
that
we
could
have
a
council
without
her
but
oswald
determined
nature
made
him
tell
to
chuck
that
rotten
game
and
go
and
look
for
her
is
our
youngest
brother
and
it
is
right
that
he
should
remember
this
and
do
as
he
was
told
but
he
happened
to
be
winning
the
beastly
halma
game
and
oswald
saw
that
there
was
going
to
be
trouble
big
trouble
as
kipling
says
and
he
was
just
bracing
his
young
nerves
for
the
conflict
with
because
he
was
not
going
to
stand
any
nonsense
from
his
young
brother
about
his
not
fetching
alice
when
he
was
jolly
well
told
to
when
the
missing
maiden
bounced
into
the
room
bearing
upon
her
brow
the
marks
of
ravaging
agitatedness
have
any
of
you
seen
pincher
she
cried
in
haste
we
all
said
no
not
since
last
night
well
then
he
lost
alice
said
making
the
ugly
face
that
means
you
are
going
to
blub
in
half
a
minute
every
one
had
sprung
to
their
feet
even
noël
and
saw
at
once
what
a
doddering
game
halma
is
and
dora
and
dicky
whatever
their
faults
care
more
for
pincher
than
for
boxes
and
screws
because
pincher
is
our
he
is
of
noble
race
and
he
was
ours
when
we
were
poor
lonely
and
lived
in
humble
in
the
lewisham
road
to
the
faithful
heart
of
young
oswald
the
blackheath
affluent
mansion
and
all
it
contains
even
the
stuffed
fox
eating
a
duck
in
the
glass
case
in
the
hall
that
he
is
so
fond
of
and
even
the
council
he
wanted
to
have
seemed
to
matter
much
less
than
old
pincher
i
want
you
all
to
let
go
out
and
look
for
him
said
alice
carrying
out
the
meaning
of
the
faces
she
had
made
and
beginning
to
howl
oh
pincher
suppose
something
happens
to
him
you
might
get
my
hat
and
coat
dora
oh
oh
oh
we
all
got
our
coats
and
hats
and
by
the
time
we
were
ready
alice
had
conquered
it
to
only
sniffing
or
else
as
oswald
told
her
kindly
she
would
have
been
allowed
to
come
let
go
on
the
heath
noël
said
the
dear
departed
dog
used
to
like
digging
there
so
we
went
and
we
said
to
every
single
person
we
met
please
have
you
seen
a
dog
with
a
black
patch
over
one
eye
and
another
over
his
tail
and
a
tan
patch
on
his
right
shoulder
and
every
one
said
no
they
had
only
some
had
more
polite
ways
of
saying
it
than
others
but
after
a
bit
we
met
a
policeman
and
he
said
i
see
one
when
i
was
on
duty
last
night
like
what
you
describe
but
it
was
at
the
end
of
a
string
there
was
a
young
lad
at
the
other
end
the
dog
did
seem
to
go
exactly
willing
he
also
told
us
the
lad
and
the
dog
had
gone
over
greenwich
way
so
we
went
down
not
quite
so
wretched
in
our
insides
because
now
it
seemed
that
there
was
some
chance
though
we
wondered
the
policeman
have
let
pincher
go
when
he
saw
he
did
want
to
but
he
said
it
his
business
and
now
we
asked
every
one
if
they
seen
a
lad
and
a
thoroughbred
with
a
black
patch
and
cetera
and
one
or
two
people
said
they
had
and
we
thought
it
must
be
the
same
the
policeman
had
seen
because
they
said
too
that
the
dog
did
seem
to
care
about
going
where
he
was
going
so
we
went
on
and
through
the
park
and
past
the
naval
college
and
we
did
even
stop
to
look
at
that
firm
ship
in
the
playground
that
the
naval
collegians
have
to
learn
about
ropes
and
spars
on
and
oswald
would
willingly
give
a
year
of
his
young
life
to
have
that
ship
for
his
very
own
and
we
did
go
into
the
painted
hall
either
because
our
fond
hearts
were
with
pincher
and
we
could
not
really
have
enjoyed
looking
at
nelson
remains
of
the
shipwrecks
where
the
drowning
people
all
look
so
dry
or
even
the
pictures
where
young
heroes
are
boarding
pirates
from
spain
just
as
oswald
would
do
if
he
had
half
a
chance
with
the
pirates
fighting
in
attitudes
more
twisted
and
spanish
than
the
pirates
of
any
nation
could
manage
even
if
they
were
not
above
it
it
is
an
odd
thing
but
all
those
pictures
are
awfully
bad
weather
even
the
ones
that
are
not
shipwrecks
and
yet
in
books
the
skies
are
usually
a
stainless
blue
and
the
sea
is
a
liquid
gem
when
you
are
engaged
in
the
avocation
of
the
author
is
sorry
to
see
that
he
is
not
going
on
with
the
story
we
walked
through
greenwich
hospital
and
asked
there
if
they
have
seen
pincher
because
i
heard
father
say
once
that
dogs
are
sometimes
stolen
and
taken
to
hospitals
and
never
seen
again
it
is
wrong
to
steal
but
i
suppose
the
hospital
doctors
forget
this
because
they
are
so
sorry
for
the
poor
ill
people
and
like
to
give
them
dogs
to
play
with
them
and
amuse
them
on
their
beds
of
anguish
but
no
one
had
seen
our
pincher
who
seemed
to
be
becoming
more
dear
to
our
hearts
every
moment
when
we
got
through
the
hospital
grounds
they
are
big
and
the
buildings
are
big
and
i
like
it
all
because
there
so
much
room
everywhere
and
nothing
niggling
we
got
down
to
the
terrace
over
the
river
next
to
the
trafalgar
hotel
and
there
was
a
sailor
leaning
on
the
railings
and
we
asked
him
the
usual
question
it
seems
that
he
was
asleep
but
of
course
we
did
not
know
or
we
would
not
have
disturbed
him
he
was
very
angry
and
he
swore
and
oswald
told
the
girls
to
come
away
but
alice
pulled
away
from
oswald
and
said
oh
do
be
so
cross
do
tell
us
if
you
seen
our
dog
he
is
and
she
recited
pincher
qualifications
ho
yes
said
the
sailor
he
had
a
red
and
angry
face
i
see
a
hour
ago
of
a
chinaman
crossed
the
river
in
a
open
boat
best
look
slippy
arter
he
grinned
and
spat
he
was
a
detestable
character
i
think
chinamen
puts
in
pies
if
catches
you
three
young
chaps
a
pie
as
need
a
big
crust
to
cover
it
get
along
with
your
cheek
so
we
got
along
of
course
we
knew
that
the
chinese
are
not
cannibals
so
we
were
not
frightened
by
that
rot
but
we
knew
too
that
the
chinese
do
really
eat
dogs
as
well
as
rats
and
birds
nests
and
other
disgraceful
forms
of
eating
illustration
it
seems
the
sailor
was
asleep
but
of
course
we
did
not
know
or
we
should
not
have
disturbed
him
was
very
tired
and
he
said
his
boots
hurt
him
and
noël
was
beginning
to
look
like
a
young
throstle
all
eyes
and
beak
he
always
does
when
he
is
tired
the
others
were
tired
too
but
their
proud
spirits
would
never
have
owned
it
so
we
went
round
to
the
trafalgar
hotel
boathouse
and
there
was
a
man
in
slippers
and
we
said
could
we
have
a
boat
and
he
said
he
would
send
a
boatman
and
would
we
walk
in
we
did
and
we
went
through
a
dark
room
piled
up
to
the
ceiling
with
boats
and
out
on
to
a
sort
of
thing
half
like
a
balcony
and
half
like
a
pier
and
there
were
boats
there
too
far
more
than
you
would
think
any
one
could
want
and
then
a
boy
came
we
said
we
wanted
to
go
across
the
river
and
he
said
where
to
to
where
the
chinamen
live
said
alice
you
can
go
to
millwall
if
you
want
to
he
said
beginning
to
put
oars
into
the
boat
are
there
any
chinese
people
there
alice
asked
and
the
boy
replied
i
dunno
he
added
that
he
supposed
we
could
pay
for
the
boat
by
a
fortunate
accident
i
think
father
had
rather
wanted
to
make
up
to
us
for
our
enduring
when
our
cousin
was
with
us
we
were
fairly
flush
of
chink
oswald
and
dicky
were
proudly
able
to
produce
handfuls
of
money
it
was
mostly
copper
but
it
did
not
fail
of
its
effect
the
boy
seemed
not
to
dislike
us
quite
so
much
as
before
and
he
helped
the
girls
into
the
boat
which
was
now
in
the
water
at
the
edge
of
a
sort
of
floating
unsteady
raft
with
openings
in
it
that
you
could
see
the
water
through
the
water
was
very
rough
just
like
real
sea
and
not
like
a
river
at
all
and
the
boy
rowed
he
would
let
us
although
i
can
quite
well
the
boat
tumbled
and
tossed
just
like
a
when
we
were
about
over
noël
pulled
alice
sleeve
and
said
do
i
look
very
green
you
do
rather
dear
she
said
kindly
i
feel
much
greener
than
i
look
said
noël
and
later
on
he
was
not
at
all
well
the
boy
laughed
but
we
pretended
not
to
notice
i
wish
i
could
tell
you
half
the
things
we
saw
as
our
boat
was
pulled
along
through
the
swishing
lumpy
water
that
turned
into
great
waves
after
every
steamer
that
went
by
oswald
was
quite
fit
but
some
of
the
others
were
very
silent
dicky
says
he
saw
everything
that
oswald
saw
but
i
am
not
sure
there
were
wharves
and
engines
and
great
rusty
cranes
swinging
handfuls
of
iron
rails
about
in
the
air
and
once
we
passed
a
ship
that
was
being
broken
up
all
the
wood
was
gone
and
they
were
taking
away
her
plates
and
the
red
rust
was
running
from
her
and
colouring
the
water
all
round
it
looked
as
though
she
was
bleeding
to
death
i
suppose
it
was
silly
to
feel
sorry
for
her
but
i
did
i
thought
how
beastly
it
was
that
she
would
never
go
to
sea
again
where
the
waves
are
clean
and
green
even
if
no
rougher
than
the
black
waves
now
raging
around
our
staunch
little
bark
i
never
knew
before
what
lots
of
kinds
of
ships
there
can
be
and
i
think
i
could
have
gone
on
and
on
for
ever
and
ever
looking
at
the
shapes
of
things
and
the
colours
they
were
and
dreaming
about
being
a
pirate
and
things
like
that
but
we
had
come
some
way
and
now
alice
said
oswald
i
think
noël
will
die
if
we
do
make
land
soon
and
indeed
he
had
been
rather
bad
for
some
time
only
i
thought
it
was
kinder
to
take
no
notice
so
our
ship
was
steered
among
other
pirate
craft
and
moored
at
a
where
there
were
steps
up
noël
was
now
so
ill
that
we
felt
we
could
not
take
him
on
a
chinese
hunt
and
had
sneaked
his
boots
off
in
the
boat
and
he
said
they
hurt
him
too
much
to
put
them
on
again
so
it
was
arranged
that
those
two
should
sit
on
a
dry
corner
of
the
steps
and
wait
and
dora
said
she
would
stay
with
them
i
think
we
ought
to
go
home
she
said
i
quite
sure
father
like
us
being
in
these
wild
savage
places
the
police
ought
to
find
pincher
but
the
others
were
going
to
surrender
like
that
especially
as
dora
had
actually
had
the
sense
to
bring
a
bag
of
biscuits
which
all
except
noël
were
now
eating
perhaps
they
ought
but
they
said
dicky
i
boiling
hot
i
leave
you
my
overcoat
in
case
you
cold
oswald
had
been
just
about
to
make
the
same
manly
proposal
though
he
was
not
extra
warm
so
they
left
their
coats
and
with
alice
who
would
come
though
told
not
to
they
climbed
the
steps
and
went
along
a
narrow
passage
and
started
boldly
on
the
chinese
hunt
it
was
a
strange
sort
of
place
over
the
river
all
the
streets
were
narrow
and
the
houses
and
the
pavements
and
the
people
clothes
and
the
mud
in
the
road
all
seemed
the
same
sort
of
dull
colour
a
sort
of
it
was
all
the
house
doors
were
open
and
you
could
see
that
the
insides
of
the
houses
were
the
same
colour
as
the
outsides
some
of
the
women
had
blue
or
violet
or
red
shawls
and
they
sat
on
the
doorsteps
and
combed
their
children
hair
and
shouted
things
to
each
other
across
the
street
they
seemed
very
much
struck
by
the
appearance
of
the
three
travellers
and
some
of
the
things
they
said
were
not
pretty
that
was
the
day
when
oswald
found
out
a
thing
that
has
often
been
of
use
to
him
in
however
rudely
poor
people
stare
at
you
they
become
all
right
instantly
if
you
ask
them
something
i
think
they
hate
you
so
much
when
they
done
something
for
you
if
it
only
to
tell
you
the
time
or
the
way
illustration
we
went
round
a
corner
rather
fast
and
came
slap
into
the
largest
woman
i
have
ever
seen
so
we
got
on
very
well
but
it
does
not
make
me
comfortable
to
see
people
so
poor
and
we
have
such
a
jolly
house
people
in
books
feel
this
and
i
know
it
is
right
to
feel
it
but
i
hate
the
feeling
all
the
same
and
it
is
worse
when
the
people
are
nice
to
you
and
we
asked
and
asked
and
asked
but
nobody
had
seen
a
dog
or
a
chinaman
and
i
began
to
think
all
was
indeed
lost
and
you
ca
go
on
biscuits
all
day
when
we
went
round
a
corner
rather
fast
and
came
slap
into
the
largest
woman
i
have
ever
seen
she
must
have
been
yards
and
yards
round
and
before
she
had
time
to
be
in
the
rage
that
we
saw
she
was
getting
into
alice
said
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
i
so
sorry
but
we
really
did
mean
to
i
so
hope
we
did
hurt
you
we
saw
the
growing
rage
fade
away
and
she
said
as
soon
as
she
got
her
fat
breath
no
done
my
little
dear
an
are
you
off
to
in
such
a
so
we
told
her
all
about
it
she
was
quite
friendly
although
so
stout
and
she
said
we
ought
to
be
gallivanting
about
all
on
our
own
we
told
her
we
were
all
right
though
i
own
oswald
was
glad
that
in
the
hurry
of
departing
alice
had
had
time
to
find
anything
to
wear
than
her
garden
coat
and
grey
tam
which
had
been
regretted
by
some
earlier
in
the
day
well
said
the
woman
if
you
go
along
this
turning
as
far
as
ever
you
can
go
and
then
take
the
first
to
the
right
and
bear
round
to
the
left
and
take
the
second
to
the
right
again
and
go
down
the
alley
between
the
stumps
you
come
to
rose
gardens
there
often
chinamen
about
there
and
if
you
come
along
this
way
as
you
come
back
keep
your
eye
open
for
me
and
i
arks
some
young
chaps
as
i
know
as
is
interested
like
in
dogs
and
perhaps
i
have
news
for
you
thank
you
very
much
alice
said
and
the
woman
asked
her
to
give
her
a
kiss
everybody
is
always
wanting
to
kiss
alice
i
ca
think
why
and
we
got
her
to
tell
us
the
way
again
and
we
noticed
the
name
of
the
street
and
it
was
nightingale
street
and
the
stairs
where
we
had
left
the
others
was
bullamy
causeway
because
we
have
the
true
instincts
and
when
you
ca
blaze
your
way
on
trees
with
your
axe
or
lay
crossed
twigs
like
the
gypsies
do
it
is
best
to
remember
the
names
of
streets
so
we
said
goodbye
and
went
on
through
the
streets
with
hardly
any
shops
and
those
only
very
small
and
common
and
we
got
to
the
alley
all
right
it
was
a
narrow
place
between
high
blank
walls
i
think
by
the
smell
it
was
gasworks
and
tanneries
there
was
hardly
any
one
there
but
when
we
got
into
it
we
heard
feet
running
ahead
of
us
and
oswald
said
hullo
suppose
that
some
one
with
pincher
and
they
recognized
his
masters
and
they
making
a
bolt
for
it
and
we
all
started
running
as
hard
as
ever
we
could
there
was
a
turn
in
the
passage
and
when
we
got
round
it
we
saw
that
the
running
was
stopping
there
were
four
or
five
boys
in
a
little
crowd
round
some
one
in
blue
blue
looked
such
a
change
after
the
muddy
colour
of
everything
in
that
dead
eastern
domain
and
when
we
got
up
the
person
the
blue
was
on
was
a
very
wrinkled
old
man
with
a
yellow
wrinkled
face
and
a
soft
felt
hat
and
blue
coat
and
i
see
that
i
ought
not
to
conceal
any
longer
from
the
discerning
reader
that
it
was
exactly
what
we
had
been
looking
for
it
was
indeed
a
celestial
chinaman
in
deep
difficulties
with
these
boys
who
were
as
alice
said
afterwards
truly
fiends
in
mortal
shape
they
were
laughing
at
the
old
chinaman
and
shouting
to
each
other
and
their
language
was
of
that
kind
that
i
was
sorry
we
had
got
alice
with
us
but
she
told
oswald
afterwards
that
she
was
so
angry
she
did
not
know
what
they
were
saying
pull
his
bloomin
pigtail
said
one
of
these
outcasts
from
decent
conduct
the
old
man
was
trying
to
keep
them
off
with
both
hands
but
the
hands
were
very
wrinkled
and
trembly
oswald
is
grateful
to
his
good
father
who
taught
him
and
dicky
the
proper
way
to
put
their
hands
up
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
oswald
does
not
know
what
on
earth
would
have
happened
for
the
outcasts
were
five
to
our
two
because
no
one
could
have
expected
alice
to
do
what
she
did
illustration
it
was
indeed
a
celestial
chinaman
in
deep
difficulties
before
oswald
had
even
got
his
hands
into
the
position
required
by
the
noble
art
of
she
had
slapped
the
largest
boy
on
the
face
as
hard
as
ever
she
could
and
she
can
slap
pretty
hard
as
oswald
knows
but
too
well
and
she
had
taken
the
boy
and
was
shaking
him
before
dicky
could
get
his
left
in
on
the
eye
of
the
slapped
assailant
of
the
aged
denizen
of
the
flowery
east
the
other
three
went
for
oswald
but
three
to
one
is
nothing
to
one
who
has
hopes
of
being
a
pirate
in
his
spare
time
when
he
grows
up
in
an
instant
the
five
were
on
us
dicky
and
i
got
in
some
good
ones
and
though
oswald
can
not
approve
of
my
sister
being
in
a
street
fight
he
must
own
she
was
very
quick
and
useful
in
pulling
ears
and
twisting
arms
and
slapping
and
pinching
but
she
had
quite
forgotten
how
to
hit
out
from
the
shoulder
like
i
have
often
shown
her
the
battle
raged
and
alice
often
turned
the
tide
of
it
by
a
shove
or
nip
the
aged
eastern
leaned
against
the
wall
panting
and
holding
his
blue
heart
with
his
yellow
hand
oswald
had
got
a
boy
down
and
was
kneeling
on
him
and
alice
was
trying
to
pull
off
two
other
boys
who
had
fallen
on
top
of
the
fray
while
dicky
was
letting
the
fifth
have
it
when
there
was
a
flash
of
blue
and
another
chinaman
dashed
into
the
tournament
fortunately
this
one
was
not
old
and
with
a
few
if
foreign
looking
blows
he
finished
the
work
so
ably
begun
by
the
brave
bastables
and
next
moment
the
five
loathsome
and
youthful
aggressors
were
bolting
down
the
passage
oswald
and
dicky
were
trying
to
get
their
breath
and
find
out
exactly
where
they
were
hurt
and
how
much
and
alice
had
burst
out
crying
and
was
howling
as
though
she
would
never
stop
that
is
the
worst
of
girls
they
never
can
keep
anything
up
any
brave
act
they
may
suddenly
do
when
for
a
moment
they
forget
that
they
have
not
the
honour
to
be
boys
is
almost
instantly
made
into
contemptibility
by
a
sudden
attack
of
crybabyishness
but
i
will
say
no
more
for
she
did
strike
the
first
blow
after
all
and
it
did
turn
out
that
the
boys
had
scratched
her
wrist
and
kicked
her
shins
these
things
make
girls
cry
the
venerable
stranger
from
distant
shores
said
a
good
deal
to
the
other
in
what
i
suppose
was
the
language
used
in
china
it
all
sounded
like
hung
and
li
and
chi
and
then
the
other
turned
to
us
and
said
nicee
lilly
girlee
same
piecee
flowelee
you
takee
my
head
to
walkee
on
this
is
alle
samee
my

chop
ancestor
dirty
white
devils
makee
him
hurt
you
come
alongee
fightee
ploper
me
likee
you
welly
muchee
alice
was
crying
too
much
to
answer
especially
as
she
could
not
find
her
handkerchief
i
gave
her
mine
and
then
she
was
able
to
say
that
she
did
not
want
to
walk
on
anybody
head
and
she
wanted
to
go
home
this
not
nicee
place
for
lillee
whitee
girlee
said
the
young
chinaman
his
pigtail
was
thicker
than
his
father
and
black
right
up
to
the
top
the
old
man
was
grey
at
the
beginning
but
lower
down
it
was
black
because
that
part
of
it
was
not
hair
at
all
but
black
threads
and
ribbons
and
odds
and
ends
of
trimmings
and
towards
the
end
both
pigtails
were
greenish
me
lun
backee
takee
him
safee
the
younger
of
the
eastern
adventurers
went
on
pointing
to
his
father
then
me
makee
walkee
all
alonk
you
takee
you
back
same
placee
you
comee

little
white

lillee
girlee
not
cly
john
givee
her
one
piecee
come
makee
talkee
with
the
house
lady
i
believe
this
is
about
what
he
said
and
we
understood
that
he
wanted
us
to
come
and
see
his
mother
and
that
he
would
give
alice
something
pretty
and
then
see
us
safe
out
of
the
horrible
country
so
we
agreed
to
go
with
them
for
we
knew
those
five
boys
would
be
waiting
for
us
on
the
way
back
most
likely
with
strong
reinforcements
alice
stopped
crying
the
minute
she
could
i
must
say
she
is
better
than
dora
in
that
way
and
we
followed
the
chinamen
who
walked
in
single
file
like
indians
so
we
did
the
same
and
talked
to
each
other
over
our
shoulders
our
grateful
oriental
friends
led
us
through
a
good
many
streets
and
suddenly
opened
a
door
with
a
key
pulled
us
in
and
shut
the
door
dick
thought
of
the
kidnapping
of
florence
dombey
and
good
brown
but
oswald
had
no
such
unnoble
thoughts
illustration
on
the
sideboard
was
a
crockery
image
the
room
was
small
and
very
very
odd
it
was
very
dirty
too
but
perhaps
it
is
not
polite
to
say
that
there
was
a
sort
of
sideboard
at
one
end
of
the
room
with
an
embroidered
dirty
cloth
on
it
and
on
the
cloth
a
crockery
image
over
a
foot
high
it
was
very
fat
and
army
and
leggy
and
i
think
it
was
an
idol
the
minute
we
got
inside
the
young
man
lighted
little
brown
sticks
and
set
them
to
burn
in
front
of
it
i
suppose
it
was
incense
there
was
a
sort
of
long
wide
low
sofa
without
any
arms
or
legs
and
a
table
that
was
like
a
box
with
another
box
in
front
of
it
for
you
to
sit
down
on
when
you
worked
and
on
the
table
were
all
sorts
of
tiny
little
tools
awls
and
brads
they
looked
like
and
and
broken
bowls
of
pipes
and
mouthpieces
for
our
rescued
chinaman
was
a
by
trade
there
was
much
else
in
the
room
except
the
smell
and
that
seemed
to
fill
it
the
smell
seemed
to
have
all
sorts
of
things
in
it
glue
and
gunpowder
and
white
garden
lilies
and
burnt
fat
and
it
was
not
so
easy
to
breathe
as
plain
air
then
a
chinese
lady
came
in
she
had
trousers
shiny
like
varnish
and
a
blue
gown
and
her
hair
was
pulled
back
very
tight
and
twisted
into
a
little
knob
at
the
back
she
wanted
to
go
down
on
the
floor
before
alice
but
we
would
let
her
then
she
said
a
great
many
things
that
we
feel
sure
were
very
nice
only
they
were
in
chinese
so
we
could
not
tell
what
they
were
and
the
chinaman
said
that
his
mother
also
wanted
alice
to
walk
on
her
head
not
alice
own
of
course
but
the
mother
i
wished
we
had
stayed
longer
and
tried
harder
to
understand
what
they
said
because
it
was
an
adventure
take
it
how
you
like
that
we
not
likely
to
look
upon
the
like
of
again
only
we
were
too
flustered
to
see
this
we
said
do
mention
it
and
things
like
that
and
when
dicky
said
i
think
we
ought
to
be
going
oswald
said
so
too
then
they
all
began
talking
chinese
like
mad
and
the
chinese
lady
came
back
and
suddenly
gave
alice
a
parrot
it
was
red
and
green
with
a
very
long
tail
and
as
tame
as
any
pet
fawn
i
ever
read
about
it
walked
up
her
arm
and
round
her
neck
and
stroked
her
face
with
its
beak
and
it
did
not
bite
oswald
or
alice
or
even
dicky
though
they
could
not
be
sure
at
first
that
it
was
not
going
to
we
said
all
the
polite
things
we
could
and
the
old
lady
made
thousands
of
hurried
chinese
replies
and
repeated
many
times
all
litey
john
which
seemed
to
be
all
the
english
she
knew
we
never
had
so
much
fuss
made
over
us
in
all
our
lives
i
think
it
was
that
that
upset
our
calmness
and
seemed
to
put
us
into
a
sort
of
silly
dream
that
made
us
not
see
what
idiots
we
were
to
hurry
off
from
scenes
we
should
never
again
behold
so
we
went
and
the
youthful
celestial
saw
us
safely
to
the
top
of
bullamy
stairs
and
left
us
there
with
the
parrot
and
floods
of
words
that
seemed
all
to
end
in
double
we
wanted
to
show
him
to
the
others
but
he
would
not
come
so
we
rejoined
our
anxious
relations
without
him
the
scene
of
rejoinder
was
painful
at
first
because
they
were
most
frightfully
sick
at
us
having
been
such
an
age
away
but
when
we
let
them
look
at
the
parrot
and
told
them
about
the
fight
they
agreed
that
it
was
not
our
fault
and
we
really
had
been
unavoidably
detained
but
dora
said
well
you
may
say
i
always
preaching
but
i
think
father
would
like
alice
to
be
fighting
street
boys
in
millwall
i
suppose
have
run
away
and
let
the
old
man
be
killed
said
dicky
and
peace
was
not
restored
till
we
were
nearly
at
greenwich
again
we
took
the
tram
to
greenwich
station
and
then
we
took
a
cab
home
and
well
worth
the
money
which
was
all
we
now
had
got
except
for
we
were
all
and
reminds
me
that
we
had
found
pincher
in
spite
of
all
our
trouble
miss
blake
who
is
our
housekeeper
was
angrier
than
i
have
ever
seen
her
she
had
been
so
anxious
that
she
had
sent
the
police
to
look
for
us
but
of
course
they
had
not
found
us
you
ought
to
make
allowances
for
what
people
do
when
they
are
anxious
so
i
forgive
her
everything
even
what
she
said
about
oswald
being
a
disgrace
to
a
respectable
house
he
owns
we
were
rather
muddy
owing
to
the
fight
and
when
the
jaw
was
over
and
we
were
having
tea
and
there
was
meat
to
it
because
we
were
as
near
starving
as
i
ever
wish
to
be
we
all
ate
lots
even
the
thought
of
pincher
could
not
thwart
our
bold
appetites
though
we
kept
saying
poor
old
pincher
i
do
wish
we
found
him
and
things
like
that
the
parrot
walked
about
among
the
as
tame
as
tame
and
just
as
alice
was
saying
how
we
go
out
again
and
have
another
try
for
our
faithful
hound
there
was
a
scratching
at
the
door
and
we
rushed
and
there
was
pincher
perfectly
well
and
mad
with
joy
to
see
us
turned
an
abrupt
beetroot
colour
oh
he
said
we
said
what
out
with
it
and
though
he
would
much
rather
have
kept
it
a
secret
buried
in
his
breast
we
made
him
own
that
he
had
shut
pincher
up
yesterday
in
the
empty
when
he
was
playing
zoological
gardens
and
forgotten
all
about
it
in
the
pleasures
of
our
cousin
having
left
us
so
we
need
not
have
gone
over
the
water
at
all
but
though
oswald
pities
all
dumb
animals
especially
those
helplessly
shut
in
at
the
bottoms
of
gardens
he
can
not
be
sorry
that
we
had
such
a
celestial
adventure
and
got
hold
of
such
a
parrot
for
alice
says
that
oswald
and
dicky
and
she
shall
have
the
parrot
between
them
she
is
tremendously
straight
i
often
wonder
why
she
was
made
a
girl
she
a
jolly
sight
more
of
a
gentleman
than
half
the
boys
at
our
school
young
this
really
happened
before
christmas
but
many
authors
go
back
to
bygone
years
for
whole
chapters
and
i
do
see
why
i
should
it
was
one
sunday
the
somethingth
sunday
in
advent
i
think
and
denny
and
daisy
and
their
father
and
albert
uncle
came
to
dinner
which
is
in
the
middle
of
the
day
on
that
day
of
rest
and
the
same
things
to
eat
for
and
us
it
is
nearly
always
roast
beef
and
yorkshire
but
the
puddings
and
vegetables
are
brightly
variegated
and
never
the
same
two
sundays
running
at
dinner
some
one
said
something
about
the
that
is
on
the
silver
tankards
which
once
when
we
were
poor
and
honest
used
to
stay
at
the
shop
having
the
dents
slowly
taken
out
of
them
for
months
and
months
but
now
they
are
always
at
home
and
are
put
at
the
four
corners
of
the
table
every
day
and
any
who
likes
can
drink
beer
out
of
them
after
some
talk
of
the
sort
you
do
listen
to
in
which
bends
and
lioncels
and
gules
and
things
played
a
promising
part
albert
uncle
said
that
turnbull
had
told
him
something
about
that
being
carved
on
a
bridge
somewhere
in
cambridgeshire
and
again
the
conversation
wandered
into
things
like
albert
uncle
had
talked
about
to
the
maidstone
antiquarian
society
the
day
they
came
over
to
see
his
old
house
in
the
country
and
we
arranged
the
roman
remains
for
them
to
dig
up
so
hearing
the
words
and
mullion
and
moulding
and
underpin
oswald
said
might
we
go
and
we
went
and
took
our
dessert
with
us
and
had
it
in
our
own
where
you
can
roast
chestnuts
with
a
free
heart
and
never
mind
what
your
fingers
get
like
when
first
we
knew
daisy
we
used
to
call
her
the
white
mouse
and
her
brother
had
all
the
appearance
of
being
one
too
but
you
know
how
untruthful
appearances
are
or
else
it
was
that
we
taught
him
happier
things
for
he
certainly
turned
out
quite
different
in
the
end
and
she
was
not
a
bad
sort
of
kid
though
we
never
could
quite
cure
her
of
wanting
to
be
ladylike
that
is
the
beastliest
word
there
is
i
think
and
albert
uncle
says
so
too
he
says
if
a
girl
ca
be
a
lady
not
worth
while
to
be
only
like
one
she
better
let
it
alone
and
be
a
free
and
happy
bounder
but
all
this
is
not
what
i
was
going
to
say
only
the
author
does
think
of
so
many
things
besides
the
story
and
sometimes
he
puts
them
in
this
is
the
case
with
thackeray
and
the
religious
tract
society
and
other
authors
as
well
as
humphrey
ward
only
i
do
suppose
you
have
ever
heard
of
her
though
she
writes
books
that
some
people
like
very
much
but
perhaps
they
are
her
friends
i
did
not
like
the
one
i
read
about
the
baronet
it
was
on
a
wet
sunday
at
the
seaside
and
nothing
else
in
the
house
but
bradshaw
and
elsie
or
like
a
or
i
have
but
what
really
happened
to
us
before
christmas
is
strictly
the
following
narrative
i
say
remarked
denny
when
he
had
burned
his
fingers
with
a
chestnut
that
turned
out
a
bad
one
after
all
and
such
is
life
and
he
had
finished
sucking
his
fingers
and
getting
rid
of
the
chestnut
about
these
antiquaries
well
what
about
them
said
oswald
he
always
tries
to
be
gentle
and
kind
to
denny
because
he
knows
he
helped
to
make
a
man
of
the
young
mouse
i
should
think
said
denny
that
it
was
so
very
difficult
to
be
one
i
do
know
said
dicky
you
have
to
read
very
dull
books
and
an
awful
lot
of
them
and
remember
what
you
read
what
more
i
do
think
so
said
alice
that
girl
who
came
with
the
antiquities
the
one
albert
uncle
said
was
upholstered
in
red
plush
like
furniture
had
read
anything
you
bet
dora
said
you
ought
not
to
bet
especially
on
sunday
and
alice
altered
it
to
you
may
be
sure
well
but
what
then
oswald
asked
denny
out
with
it
for
he
saw
that
his
youthful
friend
had
got
an
idea
and
could
get
it
out
you
should
always
listen
patiently
to
the
ideas
of
others
no
matter
how
silly
you
expect
them
to
be
i
do
wish
you
would
hurry
me
so
said
denny
snapping
his
fingers
anxiously
and
we
tried
to
be
patient
why
should
we
them
denny
said
at
last
he
means
antiquaries
said
oswald
to
the
bewildered
others
but
there
nowhere
to
go
and
nothing
to
do
when
we
get
there
the
dentist
for
short
his
real
name
being
denis
got
red
and
white
and
drew
oswald
aside
to
the
window
for
a
secret
discussion
oswald
listened
as
carefully
as
he
could
but
denny
always
buzzes
so
when
he
whispers
right
oh
he
remarked
when
the
confidings
of
the
dentist
had
got
so
that
you
could
understand
what
he
was
driving
at
though
you
being
shy
with
us
now
after
all
we
went
through
together
in
the
summer
is
simply
skittles
then
he
turned
to
the
polite
and
attentive
others
and
said
illustration
oswald
listened
as
carefully
as
he
could
but
denny
always
buzzes
so
when
he
whispers
you
remember
that
day
we
went
to
bexley
heath
with
albert
uncle
well
there
was
a
house
and
albert
uncle
said
a
clever
writer
lived
there
and
in
more
ancient
years
that
chap
in
history
sir
thomas
his
name
and
denny
thinks
he
might
let
us
be
antiquaries
there
it
looks
a
ripping
place
from
the
railway
it
really
does
it
a
fine
big
house
and
splendid
gardens
and
a
lawn
with
a
sundial
and
the
tallest
trees
anywhere
about
here
but
what
could
we
said
dicky
i
do
suppose
give
tea
though
such
indeed
had
been
our
hospitable
conduct
to
the
antiquaries
who
came
to
see
albert
uncle
oh
i
do
know
said
alice
we
might
dress
up
for
it
and
wear
spectacles
and
we
could
all
read
papers
it
would
be
lovely
something
to
fill
up
the
christmas
holidays
the
part
before
the
wedding
i
mean
do
let
all
right
i
do
mind
i
suppose
it
would
be
improving
said
dora
we
should
have
to
read
a
lot
of
history
you
can
settle
it
i
going
to
show
daisy
our
bridesmaids
dresses
it
was
alas
too
true
albert
uncle
was
to
be
married
but
shortly
after
and
it
was
partly
our
faults
though
that
does
not
come
into
this
story
so
the
two
went
to
look
at
the
clothes
girls
like
this
but
alice
who
wishes
she
had
never
consented
to
be
born
a
girl
stayed
with
us
and
we
had
a
long
and
earnest
council
about
it
one
thing
said
oswald
it
ca
possibly
be
wrong
so
perhaps
it
wo
be
amusing
oh
oswald
said
alice
and
she
spoke
rather
like
dora
i
do
mean
what
you
mean
said
oswald
in
lofty
scorn
what
i
mean
to
say
is
that
when
a
thing
is
quite
sure
to
be
right
it
not
so
well
i
mean
to
say
there
it
is
do
you
know
and
if
it
might
be
wrong
and
is
it
a
score
to
you
and
if
it
might
be
wrong
and
is
as
so
often
happens
well
you
know
yourself
adventures
sometimes
turn
out
wrong
that
you
did
think
were
going
to
but
seldom
or
never
the
uninteresting
kind
and
dicky
told
oswald
to
dry
up
which
of
course
no
one
stands
from
a
younger
brother
but
though
oswald
explained
this
at
the
time
he
felt
in
his
heart
that
he
has
sometimes
said
what
he
meant
with
more
clearness
when
oswald
and
dicky
had
finished
we
went
on
and
arranged
everything
every
one
was
to
write
a
paper
and
read
it
if
the
papers
are
too
long
to
read
while
we
there
said
noël
we
can
read
them
in
the
long
winter
evenings
when
we
are
grouped
along
the
household
hearthrug
i
shall
do
my
paper
in
poetry
about
agincourt
some
of
us
thought
agincourt
was
fair
because
no
one
could
be
sure
about
any
knight
who
took
part
in
that
conflict
having
lived
in
the
red
house
but
alice
got
us
to
agree
because
she
said
it
would
be
precious
dull
if
we
all
wrote
about
nothing
but
sir
thomas
whatdoyoucallhim
whose
real
name
in
history
oswald
said
he
would
find
out
and
then
write
his
paper
on
that
person
who
is
a
household
word
in
all
families
denny
said
he
would
write
about
charles
the
first
because
they
were
just
doing
that
part
at
his
school
i
shall
write
about
what
happened
in
said
i
know
that
alice
said
if
i
write
a
paper
it
will
be
about
mary
queen
of
scots
dora
and
daisy
came
in
just
as
she
said
this
and
it
transpired
that
this
but
lady
was
the
only
one
they
either
of
them
wanted
to
write
about
so
alice
gave
it
up
to
them
and
settled
to
do
magna
charta
and
they
could
settle
something
between
themselves
for
the
one
who
would
have
to
give
up
mary
queen
of
scots
in
the
end
we
all
agreed
that
the
story
of
that
lamented
wearer
of
pearls
and
black
velvet
would
not
make
enough
for
two
papers
everything
was
beautifully
arranged
when
suddenly
said
supposing
he
does
let
us
who
does
let
us
what
the
red
house
man
read
papers
at
his
red
house
this
was
indeed
what
nobody
had
thought
of
and
even
now
we
did
not
think
any
one
could
be
so
lost
to
proper
hospitableness
as
to
say
no
yet
none
of
us
liked
to
write
and
ask
so
we
tossed
up
for
it
only
dora
had
feelings
about
tossing
up
on
sunday
so
we
did
it
with
a
instead
of
a
penny
we
all
won
except
noël
who
lost
so
he
said
he
would
do
it
on
uncle
typewriter
which
was
on
a
visit
to
us
at
the
time
waiting
for
remington
to
fetch
it
away
to
mend
the
we
think
it
was
broken
through
albert
uncle
writing
margaret
so
often
because
it
is
the
name
of
the
lady
he
was
doomed
to
be
married
by
the
girls
had
got
the
letter
the
maidstone
antiquarian
society
and
field
clubs
secretary
had
sent
to
albert
uncle
said
they
kept
it
for
a
momentum
of
the
day
and
we
altered
the
dates
and
names
in
blue
chalk
and
put
in
a
piece
about
might
we
skate
on
the
moat
and
gave
it
to
noël
who
had
already
begun
to
make
up
his
poetry
about
agincourt
and
so
had
to
be
shaken
before
he
would
attend
and
that
evening
when
father
and
our
indian
uncle
and
albert
uncle
were
seeing
the
others
on
the
way
to
forest
hill
noël
poetry
and
pencil
were
taken
away
from
him
and
he
was
shut
up
in
father
room
with
the
remington
typewriter
which
we
had
never
been
forbidden
to
touch
and
i
do
think
he
hurt
it
much
except
quite
at
the
beginning
when
he
jammed
the
s
and
the
j
and
the
thing
that
means
per
cent
so
that
they
stuck
and
dicky
soon
put
that
right
with
a
screwdriver
he
did
not
get
on
very
well
but
kept
on
writing
or
hovce
on
new
pieces
of
paper
and
then
beginning
again
till
the
floor
was
strewn
with
his
remains
so
we
left
him
at
it
and
went
and
played
celebrated
painters
a
game
even
dora
can
not
say
anything
about
on
sunday
considering
the
bible
kind
of
pictures
most
of
them
painted
and
much
later
the
library
door
having
banged
once
and
the
front
door
twice
noël
came
in
and
said
he
had
posted
it
and
already
he
was
deep
in
poetry
again
and
had
to
be
roused
when
requisite
for
bed
it
was
not
till
next
day
that
he
owned
that
the
typewriter
had
been
a
fiend
in
disguise
and
that
the
letter
had
come
out
so
odd
that
he
could
hardly
read
it
himself
the
hateful
engine
of
destruction
would
answer
to
the
bit
in
the
least
he
said
and
i
used
nearly
a
wastepaper
basket
of
best
paper
and
i
thought
he
might
come
in
and
say
something
so
i
just
finished
it
as
well
as
i
could
and
i
corrected
it
with
the
blue
chalk
because
you
bagged
that
of
mine
and
i
did
notice
what
name
i
signed
till
after
i
licked
the
stamp
the
hearts
of
his
kind
brothers
and
sisters
sank
low
but
they
kept
them
up
as
well
as
they
could
and
said
illustration
it
was
not
till
next
day
that
he
owned
that
the
typewriter
had
been
a
fiend
in
disguise
what
name
you
sign
and
noël
said
why
edward
turnbull
of
course
like
at
the
end
of
the
real
letter
you
never
crossed
it
out
like
you
did
his
address
no
said
oswald
witheringly
you
see
i
did
think
whatever
else
you
did
know
i
did
think
you
knew
your
own
silly
name
then
alice
said
oswald
was
unkind
though
you
see
he
was
not
and
she
kissed
noël
and
said
she
and
he
would
take
turns
to
watch
for
the
postman
so
as
to
get
the
answer
which
of
course
would
be
subscribed
on
the
envelope
with
the
name
of
turnbull
instead
of
bastable
before
the
servant
could
tell
the
postman
that
the
name
was
a
stranger
to
her
and
next
evening
it
came
and
it
was
very
polite
and
and
said
we
should
be
welcome
and
that
we
might
read
our
papers
and
skate
on
the
moat
the
red
house
has
a
moat
like
the
moat
house
in
the
country
but
not
so
wild
and
dangerous
only
we
never
skated
on
it
because
the
frost
gave
out
the
minute
we
had
got
leave
to
such
is
life
as
the
sparks
fly
upwards
the
last
above
is
called
a
moral
reflection
so
now
having
got
leave
from
red
house
i
wo
give
his
name
because
he
is
a
writer
of
worldly
fame
and
he
might
not
like
it
we
set
about
writing
our
papers
it
was
not
bad
fun
only
rather
difficult
because
dora
said
she
never
knew
which
encyclo
volume
she
might
be
wanting
as
she
was
using
edinburgh
mary
scotland
bothwell
holywell
and
france
and
many
others
and
oswald
never
knew
which
he
might
want
owing
to
his
not
being
able
exactly
to
remember
the
distinguished
and
deathless
other
appellation
of
sir
thomas
thingummy
who
had
lived
in
the
red
house
noël
was
up
to
the
ears
in
agincourt
yet
that
made
but
little
difference
to
our
destiny
he
is
always
plunged
in
poetry
of
one
sort
or
another
and
if
it
had
been
that
it
would
have
been
something
else
this
at
least
we
insisted
on
having
kept
a
secret
so
he
could
not
read
it
to
us
got
very
inky
the
first
and
then
he
got
some
and
a
big
envelope
from
father
and
put
something
in
and
fastened
it
up
and
said
he
had
done
his
dicky
would
not
tell
us
what
his
paper
was
going
to
be
about
but
he
said
it
would
not
be
like
ours
and
he
let
help
him
by
looking
on
while
he
invented
more
patent
screws
for
ships
the
spectacles
were
difficult
we
got
three
pairs
of
the
uncle
and
one
that
had
belonged
to
the
housekeeper
grandfather
but
nine
pairs
were
needed
because
mouched
in
one
and
wanted
to
join
and
said
if
we
let
him
he
write
a
paper
on
the
constitutions
of
clarendon
and
we
thought
he
could
do
it
so
we
let
him
and
then
after
all
he
did
so
at
last
alice
went
down
to
bennett
in
the
village
that
we
are
such
good
customers
of
because
when
our
watches
stop
we
take
them
there
and
he
lent
us
a
lot
of
empty
frames
on
the
instinctive
understanding
that
we
would
pay
for
them
if
we
broke
them
or
let
them
get
rusty
and
so
all
was
ready
and
the
fatal
day
approached
and
it
was
the
holidays
for
us
that
is
but
not
for
father
for
his
business
never
seems
to
rest
by
day
and
night
except
at
christmas
and
times
like
that
so
we
did
not
need
to
ask
him
if
we
might
go
oswald
thought
it
would
be
more
amusing
for
father
if
we
told
it
all
to
him
in
the
form
of
an
entertaining
anecdote
afterwards
denny
and
daisy
and
albert
came
to
spend
the
day
we
told
blake
red
house
had
asked
us
and
she
let
the
girls
put
on
their
things
which
are
coats
with
capes
and
red
these
capacious
coats
are
very
good
for
playing
highwaymen
in
we
made
ourselves
quite
clean
and
tidy
at
the
very
last
we
found
that
had
been
making
marks
on
his
face
with
burnt
matches
to
imitate
wrinkles
but
really
it
only
imitated
dirt
so
we
made
him
wash
it
off
then
he
wanted
to
paint
himself
red
like
a
clown
but
we
had
decided
that
the
spectacles
were
to
be
our
only
disguise
and
even
those
were
not
to
be
assumed
till
oswald
gave
the
word
illustration
the
stationmaster
and
porter
looked
respectfully
at
us
no
casuist
observer
could
have
thought
that
the
nine
apparently
and
careless
party
who
now
wended
their
way
to
blackheath
station
looking
as
if
they
were
not
up
to
anything
in
particular
were
really
an
antiquarian
society
of
the
deepest
dye
we
got
an
empty
carriage
to
ourselves
and
halfway
between
blackheath
and
the
other
station
oswald
gave
the
word
and
we
all
put
on
the
spectacles
we
had
our
antiquarian
papers
of
lore
and
researched
history
in
rolled
up
and
tied
with
string
the
stationmaster
and
porter
of
each
of
which
the
station
boasted
but
one
specimen
looked
respectfully
at
us
as
we
got
out
of
the
train
and
we
went
straight
out
of
the
station
under
the
railway
arch
and
down
to
the
green
gate
of
the
red
house
it
has
a
lodge
but
there
is
no
one
in
it
we
peeped
in
at
the
window
and
there
was
nothing
in
the
room
but
an
old
beehive
and
a
broken
leather
strap
we
waited
in
the
front
for
a
bit
so
that
red
house
could
come
out
and
welcome
us
like
albert
uncle
did
the
other
antiquaries
but
no
one
came
so
we
went
round
the
garden
it
was
very
brown
and
wet
but
full
of
things
you
did
see
every
day
furze
for
instance
and
a
red
wall
all
round
it
with
holes
in
it
that
you
might
have
walled
heretics
up
in
in
the
olden
times
some
of
the
holes
were
quite
big
enough
to
have
taken
a
very
small
heretic
there
was
a
broken
swing
and
a
but
we
were
on
business
and
oswald
insisted
on
reading
the
papers
he
said
let
go
to
the
sundial
it
looks
dryer
there
my
feet
are
like
it
was
dryer
because
there
was
a
soaking
wet
green
lawn
round
it
and
round
that
a
sloping
path
made
of
little
squares
of
red
and
white
marble
this
was
quite
waterless
and
the
sun
shone
on
it
so
that
it
was
warm
to
the
hands
though
not
to
the
feet
because
of
boots
oswald
called
on
albert
to
read
first
albert
is
not
a
clever
boy
he
is
not
one
of
us
and
oswald
wanted
to
get
over
the
constitutions
for
albert
is
hardly
ever
amusing
even
in
fun
and
when
he
tries
to
show
off
it
is
sometimes
hard
to
bear
he
read
the
constitutions
of
clarendon
clarendon
sometimes
called
clarence
had
only
one
constitution
it
must
have
been
a
very
bad
one
because
he
was
killed
by
a
butt
of
malmsey
if
he
had
had
more
constitutions
or
better
ones
he
would
have
lived
to
be
very
old
this
is
a
warning
to
everybody
to
this
day
none
of
us
know
how
he
could
and
whether
his
uncle
helped
him
we
clapped
of
course
but
not
with
our
hearts
which
were
hissing
inside
us
and
then
oswald
began
to
read
his
paper
he
had
not
had
a
chance
to
ask
albert
uncle
what
the
other
name
of
the
sir
thomas
was
so
he
had
to
put
him
in
as
sir
thomas
blank
and
make
it
up
by
being
very
strong
on
scenes
that
could
be
better
imagined
than
described
and
as
we
knew
that
the
garden
was
five
hundred
years
old
of
course
he
could
bring
in
any
eventful
things
since
the
year
he
was
just
reading
the
part
about
the
sundial
which
he
had
noticed
from
the
train
when
we
went
to
bexley
heath
it
was
rather
a
nice
piece
i
think
most
likely
this
sundial
told
the
time
when
charles
the
first
was
beheaded
and
recorded
the
progress
of
the
great
plague
and
the
fire
of
london
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
sun
often
shone
even
in
these
devastating
occasions
so
that
we
may
picture
sir
thomas
blank
telling
the
time
here
and
remarking
o
crikey
these
last
words
are
what
oswald
himself
remarked
of
course
a
person
in
history
would
never
have
said
them
the
reader
of
the
paper
had
suddenly
heard
a
fierce
woodeny
sound
like
giant
singlesticks
terrifyingly
close
behind
him
and
looking
hastily
round
he
saw
a
most
angry
lady
in
a
bright
blue
dress
with
fur
on
it
like
a
picture
and
very
large
wooden
shoes
which
had
made
the
singlestick
noise
her
eyes
were
very
fierce
and
her
mouth
tight
shut
she
did
not
look
hideous
but
more
like
an
avenging
sprite
or
angel
though
of
course
we
knew
she
was
only
mortal
so
we
took
off
our
caps
a
gentleman
also
bounded
towards
us
over
some
vegetables
and
acted
as
reserve
support
to
the
lady
illustration
her
voice
when
she
told
us
we
were
trespassing
was
not
so
furious
her
voice
when
she
told
us
we
were
trespassing
and
it
was
a
private
garden
was
not
so
furious
as
oswald
had
expected
from
her
face
but
it
angry
at
once
said
it
was
her
garden
was
it
but
of
course
we
could
see
it
because
of
her
not
having
any
hat
or
jacket
or
gloves
and
wearing
those
wooden
shoes
to
keep
her
feet
dry
which
no
one
would
do
in
the
street
so
then
oswald
said
we
had
leave
and
showed
her
red
house
letter
but
that
was
written
to
turnbull
said
she
and
how
did
get
it
then
red
house
wearily
begged
us
to
explain
so
oswald
did
in
that
clear
straightforward
way
some
people
think
he
has
and
that
no
one
can
suspect
for
an
instant
and
he
ended
by
saying
how
far
from
comfortable
it
would
be
to
have
turnbull
coming
with
his
thin
mouth
and
his
tight
legs
and
that
we
were
bastables
and
much
nicer
than
the
one
whatever
she
might
think
and
she
listened
and
then
she
quite
suddenly
gave
a
most
jolly
grin
and
asked
us
to
go
on
reading
our
papers
it
was
plain
that
all
disagreeableness
was
at
an
end
and
to
show
this
even
to
the
stupidest
she
instantly
asked
us
to
lunch
before
we
could
politely
accept
shoved
his
oar
in
as
usual
and
said
would
stop
no
matter
how
little
there
was
for
lunch
because
he
liked
her
very
much
so
she
laughed
and
red
house
laughed
and
she
said
they
interfere
with
the
papers
and
they
went
away
and
left
us
of
course
oswald
and
dicky
insisted
on
going
on
with
the
papers
though
the
girls
wanted
to
talk
about
red
house
and
how
nice
she
was
and
the
way
her
dress
was
made
oswald
finished
his
paper
but
later
he
was
sorry
he
had
been
in
such
a
hurry
because
after
a
bit
red
house
came
out
and
said
she
wanted
to
play
too
she
pretended
to
be
a
very
ancient
antiquary
and
was
most
jolly
so
that
the
others
read
their
papers
to
her
and
oswald
knows
she
would
have
liked
his
paper
best
because
it
the
best
though
i
say
it
dicky
turned
out
to
be
all
about
that
patent
screw
and
how
nelson
would
not
have
been
killed
if
his
ship
had
been
built
with
one
daisy
paper
was
about
lady
jane
grey
and
hers
and
dora
were
exactly
alike
the
dullest
by
far
because
they
had
got
theirs
out
of
books
alice
had
not
written
hers
because
she
had
been
helping
noël
to
copy
his
denny
was
about
king
charles
and
he
was
very
and
fervent
about
this
monarch
and
white
roses
red
house
took
us
into
the
where
it
was
warmer
and
such
is
the
wonderful
architecture
of
the
red
house
gardens
that
there
was
a
fresh
for
each
paper
except
noël
and
which
were
read
in
the
stable
there
were
no
horses
there
noël
was
very
long
and
it
began
this
is
the
story
of
agincourt
if
you
do
know
it
you
jolly
well
ought
it
was
a
famous
battle
fair
and
all
your
ancestors
fought
there
that
is
if
you
come
of
a
family
old
the
bastables
do
they
were
always
very
bold
and
at
agincourt
they
fought
as
they
ought
so
we
have
been
taught
and
so
on
and
so
on
till
some
of
us
wondered
why
poetry
was
ever
invented
but
red
house
said
she
liked
it
awfully
so
noël
said
you
may
have
it
to
keep
i
got
another
one
of
it
at
home
i
put
it
next
my
heart
noël
she
said
and
she
did
under
the
blue
stuff
and
fur
was
last
but
when
we
let
him
read
it
he
would
so
dora
opened
his
envelope
and
it
was
thick
inside
with
and
in
the
middle
there
was
a
page
with
william
the
conqueror
and
nothing
else
well
he
said
i
said
i
write
all
i
knew
about
and
that
it
i
ca
write
more
than
i
know
can
i
the
girls
said
he
could
but
oswald
thought
he
might
have
tried
it
was
worth
blacking
your
face
all
over
just
for
that
he
said
but
red
house
laughed
very
much
and
said
it
was
a
lovely
paper
and
told
all
she
wanted
to
know
about
then
we
went
into
the
garden
again
and
ran
races
and
red
house
held
all
our
spectacles
for
us
and
cheered
us
on
she
said
she
was
the
patent
automatic
cheering
we
do
like
her
lunch
was
the
glorious
end
of
the
morden
house
antiquarian
society
and
field
club
field
day
but
after
lunch
was
the
beginning
of
a
real
adventure
such
as
real
antiquarians
hardly
ever
get
this
will
be
unrolled
later
i
will
finish
with
some
french
out
of
a
newspaper
albert
uncle
told
it
me
so
i
know
it
is
right
any
of
your
own
will
tell
you
what
it
means
prochain
numéro
je
vous
promets
des
in
case
your
ca
be
bothered
mean
sensation
i
believe
intrepid
explorer
and
his
we
had
spectacles
to
play
antiquaries
in
and
the
rims
were
vaselined
to
prevent
rust
and
it
came
off
on
our
faces
with
other
kinds
of
dirt
and
when
the
antiquary
game
was
over
red
house
helped
us
to
wash
it
off
with
all
the
thoroughness
of
aunts
and
far
more
gentleness
then
clean
and
with
our
hairs
brushed
we
were
led
from
the
to
the
banqueting
hall
or
it
is
a
very
beautiful
house
the
girls
thought
it
was
bare
but
oswald
likes
bareness
because
it
leaves
more
room
for
games
all
the
furniture
was
of
agreeable
shapes
and
colours
and
so
were
all
the
things
on
the
table
glasses
and
dishes
and
everything
oswald
politely
said
how
nice
everything
was
the
lunch
was
a
blissful
dream
of
perfect
tongue
and
nuts
and
apples
and
oranges
and
candied
fruits
and
in
tiny
glasses
that
noël
said
were
fairy
goblets
everybody
drank
everybody
else
health
and
noël
told
red
house
just
how
lovely
she
was
and
he
would
have
paper
and
pencil
and
write
her
a
poem
for
her
very
own
i
will
not
put
it
in
here
because
red
house
is
an
author
himself
and
he
might
want
to
use
it
in
some
of
his
books
and
the
writer
of
these
pages
has
been
taught
to
think
of
others
and
besides
i
expect
you
are
jolly
well
sick
of
noël
poetry
illustration
the
lunch
was
a
blissful
dream
of
there
was
no
restrainingness
about
that
lunch
as
far
as
a
married
lady
can
possibly
be
a
regular
brick
red
house
is
one
and
red
house
is
not
half
bad
and
knows
how
to
talk
about
interesting
things
like
sieges
and
cricket
and
foreign
postage
stamps
even
poets
think
of
things
sometimes
and
it
was
noël
who
said
directly
he
had
finished
his
poetry
have
you
got
a
secret
staircase
and
have
you
explored
your
house
properly
yes
we
have
said
that
and
unusual
lady
red
house
but
have
you
may
if
you
like
go
anywhere
she
added
with
the
unexpected
magnificence
of
a
really
noble
heart
look
at
everything
only
do
make
hay
off
with
you
or
words
to
that
effect
and
the
whole
of
us
with
proper
thanks
offed
with
us
instantly
in
case
she
should
change
her
mind
i
will
not
describe
the
red
house
to
you
because
perhaps
you
do
not
care
about
a
house
having
three
staircases
and
more
cupboards
and
odd
corners
than
we
ever
seen
before
and
great
attics
with
beams
and
enormous
drawers
on
rollers
let
into
the
wall
and
half
the
rooms
not
furnished
and
those
that
were
all
with
interesting
furniture
there
was
something
about
that
furniture
that
even
the
present
author
ca
describe
as
though
any
of
it
might
have
secret
drawers
or
panels
even
the
chairs
it
was
all
beautiful
and
mysterious
in
the
deepest
degree
when
we
had
been
all
over
the
house
several
times
we
thought
about
the
cellars
there
was
only
one
servant
in
the
kitchen
so
we
saw
and
red
house
must
be
poor
but
honest
like
we
used
to
be
and
we
said
to
her
how
do
you
do
we
got
leave
to
go
wherever
we
like
and
please
where
are
the
cellars
and
may
we
go
in
she
was
quite
nice
though
she
seemed
to
think
there
was
an
awful
lot
of
us
people
often
think
this
she
said
lor
love
a
duck
yes
i
suppose
so
in
not
ungentle
tones
and
showed
us
i
do
think
we
should
ever
have
found
the
way
from
the
house
into
the
cellar
by
ourselves
there
was
a
wide
shelf
in
the
scullery
with
a
row
of
gentlemanly
boots
on
it
that
had
been
cleaned
and
on
the
floor
in
front
a
piece
of
wood
the
general
servant
for
such
indeed
she
proved
to
be
lifted
up
the
wood
and
opened
a
little
door
under
the
shelf
and
there
was
the
beginning
of
steps
and
the
entrance
to
them
was
half
and
half
the
upright
kind
a
thing
none
of
us
had
seen
before
she
gave
us
a
and
we
pressed
forward
to
the
dark
unknown
the
stair
was
of
stone
arched
overhead
like
churches
and
it
twisted
most
unlike
other
cellar
stairs
and
when
we
got
down
it
was
all
arched
like
vaults
very
cobwebby
just
the
place
for
crimes
said
dicky
there
was
a
beer
cellar
and
a
wine
cellar
with
bins
and
a
keeping
cellar
with
hooks
in
the
ceiling
and
stone
shelves
just
right
for
venison
pasties
and
haunches
of
the
same
swift
animal
then
we
opened
a
door
and
there
was
a
cellar
with
a
well
in
it
to
throw
bodies
down
no
doubt
oswald
explained
they
were
cellars
full
of
glory
and
passages
leading
from
one
to
the
other
like
the
inquisition
and
i
wish
ours
at
home
were
like
them
there
was
a
pile
of
beer
barrels
in
the
largest
cellar
and
it
was
who
said
why
not
play
of
the
castle
so
we
did
we
had
a
most
refreshing
game
it
was
exactly
like
denny
to
be
the
one
who
slipped
down
behind
the
barrels
and
did
not
break
a
single
one
of
all
his
legs
or
arms
no
he
cried
in
answer
to
our
anxious
inquiries
i
not
hurt
a
bit
but
the
wall
here
feels
soft
at
least
not
soft
but
it
scratch
your
nails
like
stone
does
so
perhaps
it
the
door
of
a
secret
dungeon
or
something
like
that
good
old
dentist
replied
oswald
who
always
likes
denny
to
have
ideas
of
his
own
because
it
was
us
who
taught
him
the
folly
of
it
might
be
he
went
on
but
these
barrels
are
as
heavy
as
lead
and
much
more
awkward
to
collar
hold
of
could
we
get
in
some
other
way
alice
said
there
ought
to
be
a
subterranean
passage
i
expect
there
is
if
we
only
knew
oswald
has
an
enormous
geographical
bump
in
his
head
he
said
look
here
that
far
cellar
where
the
wall
does
go
quite
up
to
the
roof
that
space
we
made
out
was
under
the
i
could
creep
under
there
i
believe
it
leads
into
behind
this
door
get
me
out
oh
do
do
get
me
out
and
let
me
come
shouted
the
dentist
from
the
unseen
regions
near
the
door
so
we
got
him
out
by
oswald
lying
flat
on
his
front
on
the
top
barrel
and
the
dentist
clawed
himself
up
by
oswald
hands
while
the
others
kept
hold
of
the
boots
of
the
representative
of
the
house
of
bastable
which
of
course
oswald
is
whenever
father
is
not
there
come
on
cried
oswald
when
denny
was
at
last
able
to
appear
very
cobwebby
and
black
give
us
what
left
of
the
matches
the
others
agreed
to
stand
by
the
barrels
and
answer
our
knocking
on
the
door
if
we
ever
got
there
but
i
daresay
we
shall
perish
on
the
way
said
oswald
hopefully
so
we
started
the
other
cellar
was
easily
found
by
the
ingenious
and
oswald
it
opened
straight
on
to
the
moat
and
we
think
it
was
a
boathouse
in
times
denny
made
a
back
for
oswald
who
led
the
way
and
then
he
turned
round
and
hauled
up
his
inexperienced
but
rapidly
improving
follower
on
to
the
top
of
the
wall
that
did
not
go
quite
up
to
the
roof
it
is
like
coal
mines
he
said
beginning
to
crawl
on
hands
and
knees
over
what
felt
like
very
prickly
beach
only
we
no
picks
or
shovels
and
no
sir
humphry
davy
safety
lamps
said
denny
in
sadness
they
would
be
any
good
said
oswald
they
only
to
protect
the
mining
men
against
and
and
none
of
those
kinds
here
no
said
denny
the
damp
here
is
only
just
the
common
kind
well
then
said
oswald
and
they
crawled
a
bit
further
still
on
their
furtive
and
unassuming
stomachs
this
is
a
very
glorious
adventure
it
is
is
it
inquired
the
dentist
in
breathlessness
when
the
young
stomachs
of
the
young
explorers
had
bitten
the
dust
for
some
yards
further
yes
said
oswald
encouraging
the
boy
and
it
find
too
he
added
with
admirable
fairness
and
justice
unusual
in
one
so
young
i
only
hope
we
sha
find
a
mouldering
skeleton
buried
alive
behind
that
door
when
we
get
to
it
come
on
what
are
you
stopping
for
now
he
added
kindly
it
it
only
cobwebs
in
my
throat
denny
remarked
and
he
came
on
though
slower
than
before
oswald
with
his
customary
intrepid
caution
was
leading
the
way
and
he
paused
every
now
and
then
to
strike
a
match
because
it
was
pitch
dark
and
at
any
moment
the
courageous
leader
might
have
tumbled
into
a
well
or
a
dungeon
or
knocked
his
dauntless
nose
against
something
in
the
dark
it
all
right
for
you
he
said
to
denny
when
he
had
happened
to
kick
his
follower
in
the
eye
you
nothing
to
fear
except
my
boots
and
whatever
they
do
is
accidental
and
so
it
does
count
but
may
be
going
straight
into
some
trap
that
has
been
yawning
for
me
for
countless
ages
i
wo
come
on
so
fast
thank
you
said
the
dentist
i
do
think
you
kicked
my
eye
out
yet
so
they
went
on
and
on
crampedly
crawling
on
what
i
have
mentioned
before
and
at
last
oswald
did
not
strike
the
next
match
carefully
enough
and
with
the
suddenness
of
a
falling
star
his
hands
which
with
his
knees
he
was
crawling
on
went
over
the
edge
into
infinite
space
and
his
chest
alone
catching
sharply
on
the
edge
of
the
precipice
saved
him
from
being
hurled
to
the
bottom
of
it
halt
he
cried
as
soon
as
he
had
any
breath
again
but
alas
it
was
too
late
the
dentist
nose
had
been
too
rapid
and
had
caught
up
the
of
the
daring
leader
this
was
very
annoying
to
oswald
and
was
not
in
the
least
his
fault
do
keep
your
nose
off
my
boots
half
a
he
remarked
but
not
crossly
i
strike
a
match
and
he
did
and
by
its
weird
and
unscrutatious
light
looked
down
into
the
precipice
its
bottom
transpired
to
be
not
much
more
than
six
feet
below
so
oswald
turned
the
other
end
of
himself
first
hung
by
his
hands
and
dropped
with
fearless
promptness
uninjured
in
another
cellar
he
then
helped
denny
down
the
cornery
thing
denny
happened
to
fall
on
could
not
have
hurt
him
so
much
as
he
said
the
light
of
the
torch
i
mean
match
now
revealed
to
the
two
bold
and
youthful
youths
another
cellar
with
in
it
very
dirty
indeed
but
of
thrilling
interest
and
unusual
shapes
but
the
match
went
out
before
we
could
see
exactly
what
the
things
were
illustration
oswald
did
not
strike
the
next
match
carefully
enough
the
next
match
was
the
last
but
one
but
oswald
was
undismayed
whatever
denny
may
have
been
he
lighted
it
and
looked
hastily
round
there
was
a
door
bang
on
that
door
over
there
silly
he
cried
in
cheering
accents
to
his
trusty
lieutenant
behind
that
thing
that
looks
like
a
de
denny
had
never
been
to
woolwich
and
while
oswald
was
explaining
what
a
de
is
the
match
burnt
his
fingers
almost
to
the
bone
and
he
had
to
feel
his
way
to
the
door
and
hammer
on
it
yourself
the
blows
of
the
others
from
the
other
side
were
deafening
all
was
saved
it
was
the
right
door
go
and
ask
for
candles
and
matches
shouted
the
brave
oswald
tell
them
there
are
all
sorts
of
things
in
here
a
de
of
and
a
shovel
of
asked
dicky
voice
hollowly
from
the
other
side
of
the
door
freeze
shouted
denny
i
do
know
what
it
means
but
do
get
a
candle
and
make
them
unbarricade
the
door
i
do
want
to
go
back
the
way
we
came
he
said
something
about
oswald
boots
that
he
was
sorry
for
afterwards
so
i
will
not
repeat
it
and
i
do
think
the
others
heard
because
of
the
noise
the
barrels
made
while
they
were
being
climbed
over
this
noise
however
was
like
balmy
zephyrs
compared
to
the
noise
the
barrels
insisted
on
making
when
dicky
had
collected
some
and
the
barrels
were
being
rolled
away
during
this
interval
denny
and
oswald
were
all
the
time
in
the
pitch
dark
they
had
lighted
their
last
match
and
by
its
flickering
gleam
we
saw
a
long
large
mangle
it
like
a
double
coffin
said
oswald
as
the
match
went
out
you
can
take
my
arm
if
you
like
dentist
the
dentist
did
and
then
afterwards
he
said
he
only
did
it
because
he
thought
oswald
was
frightened
of
the
dark
it
only
for
a
little
while
said
oswald
in
the
pauses
of
the
and
i
once
read
about
two
brothers
confined
for
life
in
a
cage
so
constructed
that
the
unfortunate
prisoners
could
neither
sit
lie
nor
stand
in
comfort
we
can
do
all
those
things
yes
said
denny
but
i
rather
keep
on
standing
if
it
the
same
to
you
oswald
i
do
like
spiders
not
much
that
is
you
are
right
said
oswald
with
affable
gentleness
and
there
might
be
toads
perhaps
in
a
vault
like
this
or
serpents
guarding
the
treasure
like
in
the
cold
lairs
but
of
course
they
could
have
cobras
in
england
they
have
to
put
up
with
vipers
i
suppose
denny
shivered
and
oswald
could
feel
him
stand
first
on
one
leg
and
then
on
the
other
i
wish
i
could
stand
on
neither
of
my
legs
for
a
bit
he
said
but
oswald
answered
firmly
that
this
could
not
be
and
then
the
door
opened
with
a
and
we
saw
lights
and
faces
through
it
and
something
fell
from
the
top
of
the
door
that
oswald
really
did
think
for
one
awful
instant
was
a
hideous
mass
of
writhing
serpents
put
there
to
guard
the
entrance
like
a
sort
of
live
he
explained
just
the
sort
of
thing
a
magician
or
a
witch
would
have
thought
of
doing
but
it
was
only
dust
and
cobwebs
a
thick
damp
mat
of
them
then
the
others
surged
in
in
misunderstanding
of
the
perils
oswald
had
led
denny
into
i
mean
through
with
red
house
and
another
gentleman
and
loud
voices
and
candles
that
dripped
all
over
everybody
hands
as
well
as
their
clothes
and
the
solitary
confinement
of
the
gallant
oswald
was
at
an
end
denny
solitary
confinement
was
at
an
end
too
and
he
was
now
able
to
stand
on
both
legs
and
to
let
go
the
arm
of
his
leader
who
was
so
full
of
fortitude
this
a
find
said
the
pleased
voice
of
red
house
do
you
know
we
been
in
this
house
six
whole
months
and
a
bit
and
never
thought
of
there
being
a
door
here
perhaps
you
do
often
play
of
the
castle
said
dora
politely
it
rather
a
rough
game
i
always
think
well
curiously
enough
we
never
have
said
red
house
beginning
to
lift
out
the
chairs
in
which
avocation
we
all
helped
of
course
nansen
is
nothing
to
you
you
ought
to
have
a
medal
for
daring
explorations
said
the
other
gentleman
but
nobody
gave
us
one
and
of
course
we
did
not
want
any
reward
for
doing
our
duty
however
tight
and
cobwebby
the
cellars
proved
to
be
well
stocked
with
spiders
and
old
furniture
but
no
toads
or
snakes
which
few
if
any
regretted
snakes
are
outcasts
from
human
affection
oswald
pities
them
of
course
there
was
a
great
lumpish
thing
in
four
parts
that
red
house
said
was
a
press
and
a
ripping
settle
besides
the
chairs
and
some
carved
wood
that
red
house
and
his
friend
made
out
to
be
part
of
an
old
bed
there
was
also
a
wooden
thing
like
a
box
with
another
box
on
it
at
one
end
and
said
you
could
make
a
ripping
out
of
that
oswald
thought
so
himself
but
red
house
said
he
had
other
uses
for
it
and
would
bring
it
up
later
it
took
us
all
that
was
left
of
the
afternoon
to
get
the
things
up
the
stairs
into
the
kitchen
it
was
hard
work
but
we
know
all
about
the
dignity
of
labour
the
general
hated
the
things
we
had
so
enterprisingly
discovered
i
suppose
she
knew
who
would
have
to
clean
them
but
red
house
was
awfully
pleased
and
said
we
were
dears
we
were
not
very
clean
dears
by
the
time
our
work
was
done
and
when
the
other
gentleman
said
wo
you
all
take
a
dish
of
tea
under
my
humble
roof
the
words
like
this
were
formed
by
more
than
one
youthful
voice
well
if
you
would
be
happier
in
a
partially
cleansed
state
said
red
house
and
red
house
who
is
my
idea
of
a
feudal
lady
in
a
castle
said
oh
come
along
let
go
and
partially
clean
ourselves
i
dirtier
than
anybody
though
i
have
explored
a
bit
i
often
noticed
that
the
more
you
admire
things
the
more
they
come
off
on
you
so
we
all
washed
as
much
as
we
cared
to
and
went
to
tea
at
the
gentleman
house
which
was
only
a
cottage
but
very
beautiful
he
had
been
a
war
correspondent
and
he
knew
a
great
many
things
besides
having
books
and
books
of
pictures
it
was
a
splendid
party
we
thanked
and
everybody
when
it
was
time
to
go
and
she
kissed
the
girls
and
the
little
boys
and
then
she
put
her
head
on
one
side
and
looked
at
oswald
and
said
i
suppose
you
too
old
oswald
did
not
like
to
say
he
was
not
if
kissed
at
all
he
would
prefer
it
being
for
some
other
reason
than
his
being
not
too
old
for
it
so
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
but
noël
chipped
in
with
never
be
too
old
for
it
to
red
house
which
seemed
to
oswald
most
silly
and
unmeaning
because
she
was
already
much
too
old
to
be
kissed
by
people
unless
she
chose
to
begin
it
but
every
one
seemed
to
think
noël
had
said
something
clever
and
oswald
felt
like
a
young
ass
but
looked
at
him
so
kindly
and
held
out
her
hand
so
queenily
that
before
he
knew
he
meant
to
he
had
kissed
it
like
you
do
the
queen
then
of
course
denny
and
dicky
went
and
did
the
same
oswald
wishes
that
the
word
kiss
might
never
be
spoken
again
in
this
world
not
that
he
minded
kissing
red
house
hand
in
the
least
especially
as
she
seemed
to
think
it
was
nice
of
him
to
but
the
whole
thing
is
such
contemptible
piffle
we
were
seen
home
by
the
gentleman
who
was
red
house
and
he
stood
a
glorious
cab
with
a
white
horse
who
had
a
rolling
eye
from
blackheath
station
and
so
ended
one
of
the
most
adventuring
times
we
ever
got
out
of
a
the
ended
as
the
author
has
pointed
out
but
not
its
resultingness
thus
we
ever
find
it
in
life
the
most
unharmful
things
thoroughly
approved
even
by
but
too
often
lead
to
something
quite
different
and
that
no
one
can
possibly
approve
of
not
even
yourself
when
you
come
to
think
it
over
afterwards
like
noël
and
had
to
it
was
but
natural
that
the
hearts
of
the
young
explorers
should
have
dwelt
fondly
on
everything
underground
even
drains
which
was
what
made
us
read
a
book
by
hugo
all
the
next
day
it
is
called
the
miserables
in
french
and
the
man
in
it
who
is
a
splendid
hero
though
a
convict
and
a
robber
and
various
other
professions
escapes
into
a
drain
with
great
rats
in
it
and
is
miraculously
restored
to
the
light
of
day
unharmed
by
the
kindly
rodents
rodents
mean
rats
when
we
had
finished
all
the
part
about
drains
it
was
nearly
and
noël
said
quite
suddenly
in
the
middle
of
a
bite
of
mutton
the
red
house
is
nearly
so
red
as
ours
is
outside
why
should
the
cellars
be
so
much
cellarier
shut
up
for
was
trying
to
speak
dora
explained
to
him
how
we
do
all
have
exactly
the
same
blessings
but
he
did
seem
to
see
it
it
does
seem
like
the
way
things
happen
in
books
he
said
in
walter
scott
it
would
be
like
that
nor
yet
in
anthony
hope
i
should
think
the
rule
would
be
the
redder
the
cellarier
if
i
was
putting
it
into
poetry
i
should
make
our
cellars
have
something
much
wonderfuller
in
them
than
just
wooden
things
if
you
do
shut
up
i
never
let
you
be
in
anything
again
there
that
door
you
go
down
steps
to
said
dicky
we
never
been
in
there
if
dora
and
i
were
going
with
miss
blake
to
be
fitted
for
boots
we
might
try
that
that
just
what
i
was
coming
to
stow
it
i
felt
just
like
cellars
while
you
other
chaps
were
washing
your
hands
for
and
it
was
very
cold
but
i
made
feel
the
same
and
we
went
down
and
that
door
shut
the
intelligible
reader
may
easily
guess
that
we
finished
our
dinner
as
quickly
as
we
could
and
we
put
on
our
outers
sympathising
with
dicky
and
dora
who
owing
to
boots
were
out
of
it
and
we
went
into
the
garden
there
are
five
steps
down
to
that
door
they
were
red
brick
when
they
began
but
now
they
are
green
with
age
and
mysteriousness
and
not
being
walked
on
and
at
the
bottom
of
them
the
door
was
as
noël
said
not
fastened
we
went
in
it
is
beery
winey
cellars
at
all
alice
said
it
more
like
a
robber
look
there
we
had
got
to
the
inner
cellar
and
there
were
heaps
of
carrots
and
other
vegetables
halt
my
men
cried
oswald
advance
not
an
inch
further
the
bandits
may
lurk
not
a
yard
from
you
suppose
they
jump
out
on
us
said
they
will
not
rashly
leap
into
the
light
said
the
discerning
oswald
and
he
went
to
fetch
a
new
of
his
that
he
had
not
had
any
chance
of
really
using
before
but
some
one
had
taken
oswald
secret
matches
and
then
the
beastly
lantern
would
light
for
ever
so
long
but
he
thought
it
did
matter
his
being
rather
a
long
time
gone
because
the
others
could
pass
the
time
in
wondering
whether
anything
would
jump
out
on
them
and
if
so
what
and
when
so
when
he
got
back
to
the
red
steps
and
the
open
door
and
flashed
his
glorious
round
it
was
rather
an
annoying
thing
for
there
not
to
be
a
single
other
eye
for
it
to
flash
into
every
one
had
vanished
hallo
cried
oswald
and
if
his
gallant
voice
trembled
he
is
not
ashamed
of
it
because
he
knows
about
wells
in
cellars
and
for
an
instant
even
he
did
not
know
what
had
happened
but
an
answering
hullo
came
from
beyond
and
he
hastened
after
the
others
look
out
said
alice
do
tumble
over
that
heap
of
bones
oswald
did
look
out
of
course
he
would
not
wish
to
walk
on
any
bones
but
he
did
not
jump
back
with
a
scream
whatever
noël
may
say
when
he
is
in
a
temper
the
heap
really
did
look
very
like
bones
partly
covered
with
earth
oswald
was
glad
to
learn
that
they
were
only
parsnips
we
waited
as
long
as
we
could
said
alice
but
we
thought
perhaps
you
been
collared
for
some
little
thing
you
forgotten
all
about
doing
and
would
be
able
to
come
back
but
we
found
noël
had
fortunately
got
your
matches
i
so
glad
you
were
collared
oswald
dear
some
boys
would
have
let
noël
know
about
the
matches
but
oswald
did
the
heaps
of
carrots
and
turnips
and
parsnips
and
things
were
not
very
interesting
when
you
knew
that
they
were
not
bleeding
warriors
or
pilgrims
bones
and
it
was
too
cold
to
pretend
for
long
with
any
comfort
to
the
young
pretenders
so
oswald
said
let
go
out
on
the
heath
and
play
something
warm
you
ca
warm
yourself
with
matches
even
if
they
not
your
own
that
was
all
he
said
a
great
hero
would
not
stoop
to
argue
about
matches
and
alice
said
all
right
and
she
and
oswald
went
out
and
played
pretending
golf
with
some
of
father
but
noël
and
preferred
to
sit
stuffily
over
the
fire
so
that
oswald
and
alice
as
well
as
dora
and
dicky
who
were
being
measured
for
boots
were
entirely
out
of
the
rest
of
what
happened
and
the
author
can
only
imagine
the
events
that
now
occurred
when
noël
and
had
roasted
their
legs
by
the
fire
till
they
were
so
hot
that
their
stockings
quite
hurt
them
one
of
them
must
have
said
to
the
other
i
never
knew
which
let
go
and
have
another
look
at
that
cellar
the
other
whoever
it
was
foolishly
consented
so
they
went
and
they
took
oswald
in
his
absence
and
without
his
leave
they
found
a
hitherto
unnoticed
door
behind
the
other
one
and
noël
says
he
said
we
better
not
go
in
says
he
said
so
too
but
any
way
they
go
in
they
found
themselves
in
a
small
vaulted
place
that
we
found
out
afterwards
had
been
used
for
mushrooms
but
it
was
long
since
any
fair
bud
of
a
mushroom
had
blossomed
in
that
dark
retreat
the
place
had
been
cleaned
and
new
shelves
put
up
and
when
noël
and
saw
what
was
on
these
shelves
the
author
is
sure
they
turned
pale
though
they
say
not
for
what
they
saw
was
coils
and
pots
and
wires
and
one
of
them
said
in
a
voice
that
must
have
trembled
it
is
dynamite
i
am
certain
of
it
what
shall
we
do
i
am
certain
the
other
said
this
is
to
blow
up
father
because
he
took
part
in
the
lewisham
election
and
his
side
won
the
reply
no
doubt
was
there
is
no
time
for
delay
we
must
act
we
must
cut
the
fuse
all
the
fuses
there
are
dozens
oswald
thinks
it
was
not
half
bad
business
those
two
kids
for
noël
is
little
more
than
one
owing
to
his
poetry
and
his
bronchitis
standing
in
the
abode
of
dynamite
and
not
screeching
or
running
off
to
tell
miss
blake
or
the
servants
or
any
one
but
just
doing
right
without
any
fuss
illustration
with
scissors
and
gas
pliers
they
cut
every
fuse
i
need
hardly
say
it
did
not
prove
to
be
the
right
thing
but
they
thought
it
was
and
oswald
can
not
think
that
you
are
really
doing
wrong
if
you
really
think
you
are
doing
right
i
hope
you
will
understand
this
i
believe
the
kids
tried
cutting
the
fuses
with
dick
that
was
in
the
pocket
of
his
other
clothes
but
the
fuses
would
not
no
matter
how
little
you
trembled
when
you
touched
them
but
at
last
with
scissors
and
the
gas
pliers
they
cut
every
fuse
the
fuses
were
long
twisty
wire
things
covered
with
green
wool
like
then
noël
and
and
oswald
for
one
thinks
it
showed
a
goodish
bit
of
pluck
and
policemen
have
been
made
heroes
for
less
got
cans
and
cans
of
water
from
the
tap
by
the
greenhouse
and
poured
sluicing
showers
of
the
icy
fluid
in
among
the
internal
machinery
of
the
dynamite
arrangement
for
so
they
believed
it
to
be
then
very
wet
but
feeling
that
they
had
saved
their
father
and
the
house
they
went
and
changed
their
clothes
i
think
they
were
a
little
about
it
believing
it
to
be
an
act
unrivalled
in
devotedness
and
they
were
most
tiresome
all
the
afternoon
talking
about
their
secret
and
not
letting
us
know
what
it
was
but
when
father
came
home
early
as
it
happened
those
but
in
oswald
opinion
kiddies
learned
the
terrible
truth
of
course
oswald
and
dicky
would
have
known
at
once
if
noël
and
had
been
so
cocky
about
not
telling
us
we
could
have
exposed
the
truth
to
them
in
all
its
uninteresting
nature
i
hope
the
reader
will
now
prepare
himself
for
a
shock
in
a
wild
whirl
of
darkness
and
the
gas
being
cut
off
and
not
being
able
to
get
any
light
and
father
saying
all
sorts
of
things
it
all
came
out
those
coils
and
jars
and
wires
in
that
cellar
were
not
an
infernal
machine
at
all
it
was
i
know
you
will
be
very
much
surprised
it
was
the
electric
lights
and
bells
that
father
had
had
put
in
while
we
were
at
the
red
house
the
day
before
and
noël
caught
it
very
fully
and
oswald
thinks
this
was
one
of
the
few
occasions
when
my
father
was
not
as
just
as
he
meant
to
be
my
uncle
was
not
just
either
but
then
it
is
much
longer
since
he
was
a
boy
so
we
must
make
excuses
for
him
we
sent
red
house
a
christmas
card
each
in
spite
of
the
trouble
that
her
cellars
had
lured
him
into
noël
sent
her
a
homemade
one
with
an
endless
piece
of
his
everlasting
poetry
on
it
and
next
may
she
wrote
and
asked
us
to
come
and
see
her
try
to
be
just
and
we
saw
that
it
was
not
really
her
fault
that
noël
and
had
cut
those
electric
wires
so
we
all
went
but
we
did
not
take
albert
morrison
because
he
was
fortunately
away
with
an
aged
of
his
mother
who
writes
tracts
at
tunbridge
wells
the
garden
was
all
flowery
and
green
and
and
red
house
were
nice
and
jolly
and
we
had
a
distinguished
and
time
but
would
you
believe
it
that
boxish
thing
in
the
cellar
that
wanted
them
to
make
a
of
well
red
house
had
cleaned
it
and
mended
it
and
red
house
took
us
up
to
the
room
where
it
was
to
let
us
look
at
it
again
and
unbelievable
to
relate
it
turned
out
to
have
rockers
and
some
one
in
dark
bygone
ages
seems
for
reasons
unknown
to
the
present
writer
to
have
wasted
no
end
of
carpentry
and
carving
on
it
just
to
make
it
into
a
and
what
is
more
since
we
were
there
last
and
red
house
had
succeeded
in
obtaining
a
small
but
quite
alive
baby
to
put
in
it
i
suppose
they
thought
it
was
wilful
waste
to
have
a
cradle
and
no
baby
to
use
it
but
it
could
so
easily
have
been
used
for
something
else
it
would
have
made
a
ripping
and
babies
are
far
more
trouble
than
rabbits
to
keep
and
not
nearly
so
profitable
i
believe
turk
in
chains
or
richard
the
morning
dawned
in
cloudless
splendour
the
sky
was
a
pale
cobalt
colour
as
in
pictures
of
swiss
scenery
the
sun
shone
brightly
and
all
the
green
things
in
the
garden
sparkled
in
the
bewitching
rays
of
the
monarch
of
the
skies
the
author
of
this
does
not
like
to
read
much
about
the
weather
in
books
but
he
is
obliged
to
put
this
piece
in
because
it
is
true
and
it
is
a
thing
that
does
not
very
often
happen
in
the
middle
of
january
in
fact
i
never
remember
the
weather
being
at
all
like
that
in
the
winter
except
on
that
one
day
of
course
we
all
went
into
the
garden
directly
after
brekker
i
have
said
green
things
perhaps
you
think
that
is
a
or
slip
of
the
tongue
and
that
there
are
not
any
green
things
in
the
winter
but
there
are
and
not
just
evergreens
either
wallflowers
and
pansies
and
snapdragons
and
primroses
and
lots
of
things
keep
green
all
the
year
unless
it
too
frosty
live
and
learn
and
it
was
so
warm
we
were
able
to
sit
in
the
the
birds
were
singing
like
mad
perhaps
they
thought
it
was
springtime
or
perhaps
they
always
sing
when
they
see
the
sun
without
paying
attention
to
dates
and
now
when
all
his
brothers
and
sisters
were
sitting
on
the
rustic
seats
in
the
the
oswald
suddenly
saw
that
now
was
the
moment
for
him
to
hold
that
council
he
had
been
wanting
to
hold
for
some
time
so
he
stood
in
the
door
of
the
in
case
any
of
the
others
should
suddenly
remember
that
they
wanted
to
be
in
some
other
place
and
he
said
i
say
about
that
council
i
want
to
hold
and
dicky
replied
well
what
about
it
so
then
oswald
explained
all
over
again
that
we
had
been
treasure
seekers
and
we
had
been
and
he
thought
it
was
time
we
were
something
else
being
something
else
makes
you
think
of
things
he
said
at
the
end
of
all
the
other
things
he
said
yes
said
yawning
without
putting
up
his
hand
which
is
not
manners
and
we
told
him
so
but
can
think
of
things
without
being
other
things
look
how
i
thought
about
being
a
clown
and
going
to
rome
i
should
think
you
would
want
us
to
remember
said
dora
and
indeed
father
had
not
been
pleased
with
about
that
affair
but
oswald
never
encourages
dora
to
nag
so
he
said
patiently
yes
you
think
of
things
you
much
better
not
have
thought
of
now
my
idea
is
let
each
say
what
sort
of
a
society
we
shall
make
ourselves
into
like
we
did
when
we
were
treasure
seekers
about
the
different
ways
to
look
for
it
i
mean
let
hold
our
tongues
no
not
with
your
dirty
fingers
old
chap
hold
it
with
your
teeth
if
you
must
hold
it
with
something
let
hold
our
tongues
for
a
bit
and
then
all
say
what
we
thought
of
in
ages
the
thoughtful
boy
added
hastily
so
that
every
one
should
not
speak
at
once
when
we
had
done
holding
our
tongues
so
we
were
all
silent
and
the
birds
sang
industriously
among
the
leafless
trees
of
our
large
sunny
garden
in
beautiful
blackheath
the
author
is
sorry
to
see
he
is
getting
poetical
it
shall
not
happen
again
and
it
an
extra
fine
day
really
and
the
birds
did
sing
a
fair
treat
when
three
long
minutes
had
elapsed
themselves
by
the
hands
of
watch
which
always
keeps
perfect
time
for
three
or
four
days
after
he
has
had
it
mended
he
closed
the
watch
and
observed
time
go
ahead
dora
dora
went
ahead
in
the
following
remarks
i
thought
as
hard
as
i
can
and
nothing
will
come
into
my
head
except
good
sweet
maid
and
let
who
will
be
clever
do
you
think
we
might
try
to
find
some
new
ways
to
be
good
in
no
you
do
i
bar
that
came
at
once
from
the
mouths
of
dicky
and
oswald
you
do
come
that
over
us
twice
dicky
added
and
oswald
eloquently
said
no
more
thank
you
dora
dora
said
well
she
could
think
of
anything
else
and
she
expect
oswald
had
thought
of
anything
better
yes
i
have
replied
her
brother
what
i
think
is
that
we
half
enough
if
you
mean
extra
swat
said
alice
i
more
homers
than
i
care
for
already
thank
you
i
do
not
mean
swat
rejoined
the
experienced
oswald
i
want
to
know
all
about
real
things
not
booky
things
if
you
kids
had
known
about
electric
bells
you
would
have
oswald
stopped
and
then
said
i
wo
say
any
more
because
father
says
a
gentleman
does
not
support
his
arguments
with
personal
illusions
to
other
people
faults
and
follies
faults
and
follies
yourself
said
the
girls
restored
peace
and
oswald
went
on
let
us
seek
to
grow
wiser
and
to
teach
each
other
bar
that
said
i
do
want
oswald
and
dicky
always
on
to
me
and
call
it
teaching
we
might
call
the
society
the
said
oswald
hastily
it
not
so
dusty
said
dicky
let
go
on
to
the
others
before
we
decide
you
next
yourself
said
alice
oh
so
i
am
remarked
dicky
trying
to
look
surprised
well
my
idea
is
let
be
a
sort
of
industrious
society
of
beavers
and
make
a
solemn
vow
and
covenant
to
make
something
every
day
we
might
call
it
the
it
would
be
the
before
we
done
with
it
said
oswald
and
alice
said
we
could
always
make
things
that
would
be
any
good
and
then
we
should
have
to
do
something
that
was
any
good
and
that
would
be
rot
yes
i
know
it
my
turn
you
kick
the
table
to
pieces
if
you
go
on
like
that
do
for
goodness
sake
keep
your
feet
still
the
only
thing
i
can
think
of
is
a
society
called
the
with
you
and
dora
for
members
and
noël
poets
are
boys
exactly
said
if
you
do
shut
up
you
sha
be
in
it
at
all
said
alice
putting
her
arm
round
noël
no
i
meant
us
all
to
be
in
it
only
you
boys
are
not
to
keep
saying
we
only
girls
and
let
us
do
everything
the
same
as
you
boys
do
i
do
want
to
be
a
boy
thank
you
said
dora
not
when
i
see
how
they
behave
stop
sniffing
and
use
your
handkerchief
well
take
mine
then
it
was
now
noël
turn
to
disclose
his
idea
which
proved
most
awful
let
be
he
said
and
solemnly
vow
and
convenient
to
write
one
piece
of
poetry
a
day
as
long
as
we
live
most
of
us
were
dumb
at
the
dreadful
thought
but
alice
said
that
would
never
do
noël
dear
because
you
the
only
one
of
us
clever
enough
to
do
it
so
noël
detestable
and
degrading
idea
was
shelved
without
oswald
having
to
say
anything
that
would
have
made
the
youthful
poet
weep
i
suppose
you
do
mean
me
to
say
what
i
thought
of
said
but
i
shall
i
think
you
ought
all
to
be
in
a
society
and
vow
solemn
convents
and
things
not
to
be
down
on
your
younger
brother
we
explained
to
him
at
once
that
could
be
in
that
because
he
had
got
a
younger
brother
and
you
may
think
yourself
lucky
you
have
dicky
added
the
ingenious
and
felicitous
oswald
was
just
going
to
begin
about
the
council
all
over
again
when
the
portable
form
of
our
indian
uncle
came
stoutly
stumping
down
the
garden
path
under
the
cedars
hi
brigands
he
cried
in
his
cheerful
unclish
manner
who
on
for
the
hippodrome
this
bright
day
and
instantly
we
all
were
even
oswald
because
after
all
you
can
have
a
council
any
day
but
hippodromes
are
not
like
that
illustration
hi
brigands
he
cried
we
got
ready
like
the
whirlwind
of
the
desert
for
quickness
and
started
off
with
our
kind
uncle
who
has
lived
so
long
in
india
that
he
is
much
more
than
you
would
think
to
look
at
him
to
the
station
dicky
remembered
his
patent
screw
for
working
ships
with
he
had
been
messing
with
it
in
the
bath
while
he
was
waiting
for
oswald
to
have
done
plunging
cleanly
in
the
basin
and
in
the
he
had
forgotten
to
take
it
out
so
now
he
ran
back
because
he
knew
how
its
cardboardiness
would
turn
to
pulp
if
it
was
left
i
catch
you
up
he
cried
the
uncle
took
the
tickets
and
the
train
came
in
and
still
dicky
had
not
caught
us
up
tiresome
boy
said
the
uncle
you
do
want
to
miss
the
beginning
eh
what
ah
here
he
comes
the
uncle
got
in
and
so
did
we
but
dicky
did
not
see
the
uncle
newspaper
which
oswald
waved
and
he
went
running
up
and
down
the
train
looking
for
us
instead
of
just
getting
in
anywhere
sensibly
as
oswald
would
have
done
when
the
train
began
to
move
he
did
try
to
open
a
carriage
door
but
it
stuck
and
the
train
went
faster
and
just
as
he
got
it
open
a
large
heavy
porter
caught
him
by
the
collar
and
pulled
him
off
the
train
saying
now
young
shaver
no
susansides
on
this
ere
line
if
please
dicky
hit
the
porter
but
his
fury
was
vain
next
moment
the
train
had
passed
away
and
us
in
it
dicky
had
no
money
and
the
uncle
had
all
the
tickets
in
the
pocket
of
his
fur
coat
i
am
not
going
to
tell
you
anything
about
the
hippodrome
because
the
author
feels
that
it
was
a
trifle
beastly
of
us
to
have
enjoyed
it
as
much
as
we
did
considering
dicky
we
tried
not
to
talk
about
it
before
him
when
we
got
home
but
it
was
very
difficult
especially
the
elephants
i
suppose
he
spent
an
afternoon
of
bitter
thoughts
after
he
had
told
that
porter
what
he
thought
of
him
which
took
some
time
and
the
interfered
in
the
end
when
we
got
home
he
was
all
right
with
us
he
had
had
time
to
see
it
was
not
our
faults
whatever
he
thought
at
the
time
he
refused
to
talk
about
it
only
he
said
i
going
to
take
it
out
of
that
porter
you
leave
me
alone
i
shall
think
of
something
presently
revenge
is
very
wrong
said
dora
but
even
alice
asked
her
kindly
to
dry
up
we
all
felt
that
it
was
simply
piffle
to
talk
to
one
so
disappointed
as
our
unfortunate
brother
it
wrong
though
said
dora
wrong
be
blowed
said
dicky
snorting
who
began
it
i
should
like
to
know
the
station
a
beastly
awkward
place
to
take
it
out
of
any
one
in
i
wish
i
knew
where
he
lived
know
said
noël
i
known
it
a
long
time
before
christmas
when
we
were
going
to
the
moat
house
well
what
is
it
then
asked
dicky
savagely
do
bite
his
head
off
remarked
alice
tell
us
about
it
noël
how
do
you
know
it
was
when
you
were
weighing
yourselves
on
the
weighing
machine
i
did
because
my
weight
is
worth
being
weighed
for
and
there
was
a
heap
of
hampers
and
turkeys
and
hares
and
things
and
there
was
a
label
on
a
turkey
and
parcel
and
that
porter
that
you
hate
so
said
to
the
other
porter
oh
hurry
up
do
said
dicky
i
wo
tell
you
at
all
if
you
bully
me
said
noël
and
alice
had
to
coax
him
before
he
would
go
on
well
he
looked
at
the
label
and
said
mistake
here
bill
wrong
address
ought
to
be
abel
place
eh
and
the
other
one
looked
and
he
said
it
got
your
name
right
enough
fine
turkey
too
and
his
chains
in
the
parcel
pity
they
more
careful
about
addressing
things
eh
so
when
they
had
done
laughing
about
it
i
looked
at
the
label
and
it
said
johnson
granville
park
so
i
knew
it
was
abel
place
he
lived
at
and
his
name
was
james
johnson
good
old
sherlock
holmes
said
oswald
you
wo
really
him
said
noël
will
you
not
corsican
revenge
with
knives
or
poisoned
bowls
i
would
do
more
than
a
good
if
i
was
you
when
noël
said
the
word
we
all
saw
a
strange
happy
look
come
over
dicky
face
it
is
called
a
look
i
believe
and
you
can
see
it
in
the
picture
of
a
woman
cuddling
a
with
her
hair
down
that
is
in
all
the
shops
and
they
call
it
the
awakening
directly
dicky
soul
had
finished
waking
up
he
shut
his
teeth
together
with
a
click
then
he
said
i
got
it
of
course
we
all
knew
that
any
one
who
thinks
revenge
is
wrong
is
asked
to
leave
dora
said
he
was
very
unkind
and
did
he
really
want
to
turn
her
out
there
a
jolly
good
fire
in
father
study
he
said
no
i
not
waxy
with
you
but
i
going
to
have
my
revenge
and
i
do
want
you
to
do
anything
you
thought
wrong
you
only
make
no
end
of
a
fuss
afterwards
well
it
wrong
so
i
go
said
dora
do
say
i
did
warn
you
that
all
and
she
went
then
dicky
said
now
any
more
conscious
objectors
and
when
no
one
replied
he
went
on
it
was
you
saying
gave
me
the
idea
his
name
james
johnson
is
it
and
he
said
the
things
were
addressed
wrong
did
he
well
send
him
a
a
turk
in
chains
said
noël
growing
at
the
thought
a
turk
or
no
not
a
dead
one
dicky
the
turk
i
going
to
send
wo
be
a
live
one
nor
yet
a
dead
one
how
horrible
dead
that
worse
than
anything
and
noël
became
so
green
in
the
face
that
alice
told
dicky
to
stop
playing
the
goat
and
tell
us
what
his
idea
really
was
do
you
see
he
cried
saw
it
directly
i
daresay
said
oswald
it
easy
to
see
your
own
idea
drive
ahead
well
i
going
to
get
a
hamper
and
pack
it
full
of
parcels
and
put
a
list
of
them
on
the
top
beginning
and
send
it
to
mister
james
johnson
and
when
he
opens
the
parcels
there
be
nothing
inside
there
must
be
something
you
know
said
or
the
parcels
wo
be
any
shape
except
flatness
oh
there
be
right
enough
was
the
bitter
reply
of
the
one
who
had
not
been
to
the
hippodrome
but
it
wo
be
the
sort
of
something
he
expect
it
to
be
let
do
it
now
i
get
a
hamper
illustration
it
was
rather
difficult
to
get
anything
the
shape
of
a
turkey
he
got
a
big
one
out
of
the
cellar
and
four
empty
bottles
with
their
straw
cases
we
filled
the
bottles
with
black
ink
and
water
and
red
ink
and
water
and
soapy
water
and
water
plain
and
we
put
them
down
on
the
list
bottle
of
port
wine
bottle
of
sherry
wine
bottle
of
sparkling
champagne
bottle
of
rum
the
rest
of
the
things
we
put
on
the
list
were
pounds
of
chains
pounds
of
pounds
of
almonds
and
raisins
box
of
figs
bottle
of
french
plums
large
cake
and
we
made
up
parcels
to
look
outside
as
if
their
inside
was
full
of
the
delicious
attributes
described
in
the
list
it
was
rather
difficult
to
get
anything
the
shape
of
a
turkey
but
with
coals
and
crushed
newspapers
and
firewood
we
did
it
and
when
it
was
done
up
with
lots
of
string
and
the
paper
artfully
squeezed
tight
to
the
firewood
to
look
like
the
turk
legs
it
really
was
almost
lifelike
in
its
deceivingness
the
chains
or
sausages
we
did
with
dusters
and
not
clean
ones
rolled
tight
and
the
paper
moulded
gently
to
their
forms
the
was
a
newspaper
ball
the
were
newspapers
too
and
so
were
the
almonds
and
raisins
the
box
of
figs
was
a
real
with
cinders
and
ashes
in
it
damped
to
keep
them
from
rattling
about
the
bottle
was
real
too
it
had
newspaper
soaked
in
ink
in
it
and
the
cake
was
half
a
of
dora
done
up
very
carefully
and
put
at
the
bottom
of
the
hamper
inside
the
we
put
a
paper
with
revenge
is
not
wrong
when
the
other
people
begin
it
was
you
began
and
now
you
are
jolly
well
served
out
we
packed
all
the
bottles
and
parcels
into
the
hamper
and
put
the
list
on
the
very
top
pinned
to
the
paper
that
covered
the
false
breast
of
the
imitation
turk
dicky
wanted
to
write
from
an
unknown
friend
but
we
did
not
think
that
was
fair
considering
how
dicky
felt
so
at
last
we
put
from
one
who
does
not
wish
to
sign
his
name
and
that
was
true
at
any
rate
dicky
and
oswald
lugged
the
hamper
down
to
the
shop
that
has
carter
paterson
board
outside
i
vote
we
do
pay
the
carriage
said
dicky
but
that
was
perhaps
because
he
was
still
so
very
angry
about
being
pulled
off
the
train
oswald
had
not
had
it
done
to
him
so
he
said
that
we
ought
to
pay
the
carriage
and
he
was
jolly
glad
afterwards
that
this
honourable
feeling
had
arisen
in
his
young
bosom
and
that
he
had
jolly
well
made
dicky
let
it
rise
in
his
we
paid
the
carriage
it
was
but
dicky
said
it
was
cheap
for
a
revenge
like
this
and
after
all
it
was
his
money
the
carriage
was
paid
with
so
then
we
went
home
and
had
another
go
in
of
grub
because
tea
had
been
rather
upset
by
dicky
revenge
the
people
where
we
left
the
hamper
told
us
that
it
would
be
delivered
next
day
so
next
morning
we
gloated
over
the
thought
of
the
sell
that
porter
was
in
for
and
dicky
was
more
deeply
gloating
than
any
one
i
expect
it
got
there
by
now
he
said
at
it
a
first
class
what
a
sell
for
him
he
read
the
list
and
then
he
take
out
one
parcel
after
another
till
he
comes
to
the
cake
it
a
ripping
idea
i
glad
i
thought
of
it
i
not
said
noël
suddenly
i
wish
you
had
i
wish
we
had
i
know
just
exactly
what
he
feels
like
now
he
feels
as
if
he
like
to
you
for
it
and
i
daresay
he
would
if
you
had
been
a
craven
skulker
and
not
signed
your
name
it
was
a
thunderbolt
in
our
midst
noël
behaving
like
this
it
made
oswald
feel
a
sick
inside
feeling
that
perhaps
dora
had
been
right
she
sometimes
is
and
oswald
hates
this
feeling
dicky
was
so
surprised
at
the
cheek
of
his
young
brother
that
for
a
moment
he
was
speechless
and
before
he
got
over
his
speechlessness
noël
was
crying
and
would
have
any
more
dinner
alice
spoke
in
the
eloquent
language
of
the
human
eye
and
begged
dicky
to
look
over
it
this
once
and
he
replied
by
means
of
the
same
useful
organ
that
he
did
care
what
a
silly
kid
thought
so
no
more
was
said
when
noël
had
done
crying
he
began
to
write
a
piece
of
poetry
and
kept
at
it
all
the
afternoon
oswald
only
saw
just
the
beginning
it
was
called
the
disappointed
porter
fury
to
be
by
the
porter
and
it
began
when
first
i
opened
the
hamper
fair
and
saw
the
parcel
inside
there
my
heart
rejoiced
like
dry
gardens
when
it
rains
but
soon
i
changed
and
then
i
seized
my
trusty
knife
and
bowl
of
poison
and
said
the
whole
i
will
have
the
life
of
the
man
or
woman
who
thought
of
this
wicked
plan
to
deceive
a
trusting
porter
so
no
noble
heart
would
have
thought
of
it
no
there
were
pages
and
pages
of
it
of
course
it
was
all
nonsense
the
poetry
i
mean
and
yet
i
have
seen
that
put
in
books
when
the
author
does
not
want
to
let
out
all
he
thought
at
the
time
that
evening
at
jane
came
and
said
master
dicky
there
an
old
aged
man
at
the
door
inquiring
if
you
live
here
so
dicky
thought
it
was
the
bootmaker
perhaps
so
he
went
out
and
oswald
went
with
him
because
he
wanted
to
ask
for
a
bit
of
wax
but
it
was
not
the
shoemaker
it
was
an
old
man
pale
in
the
face
and
white
in
the
hair
and
he
was
so
old
that
we
asked
him
into
study
by
the
fire
as
soon
as
we
had
found
out
it
was
really
dicky
he
wanted
to
see
when
we
got
him
there
he
said
might
i
trouble
you
to
shut
the
door
this
is
the
way
a
burglar
or
a
murderer
might
behave
but
we
did
not
think
he
was
one
he
looked
too
old
for
these
professions
when
the
door
was
shut
he
said
i
ai
got
much
to
say
young
gemmen
it
only
to
ask
was
it
you
sent
this
he
pulled
a
piece
of
paper
out
of
his
pocket
and
it
was
our
list
oswald
and
dicky
looked
at
each
other
did
you
send
it
said
the
old
man
again
so
then
dicky
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
yes
oswald
said
how
did
you
know
and
who
are
you
the
old
man
got
whiter
than
ever
he
pulled
out
a
piece
of
paper
it
was
the
piece
we
wrapped
the
turk
and
chains
in
and
it
had
a
label
on
it
that
we
had
noticed
with
dicky
name
and
address
on
it
the
new
bat
he
got
at
christmas
had
come
in
it
illustration
when
the
door
was
shut
he
said
i
ai
got
much
to
say
young
gemmen
that
how
i
know
said
the
old
man
ah
be
sure
your
sin
will
find
you
out
but
who
are
you
anyway
asked
oswald
again
oh
ai
nobody
in
particular
he
said
i
only
the
father
of
the
pore
gell
as
you
took
in
with
your
cruel
deceitful
lying
tricks
oh
you
may
look
uppish
young
sir
but
i
here
to
speak
my
mind
and
i
speak
it
if
i
die
for
it
so
now
but
we
did
send
it
to
a
girl
said
dicky
we
would
do
such
a
thing
we
sent
it
for
a
for
a
i
think
he
tried
to
say
for
a
joke
but
he
could
with
the
fiery
way
the
old
man
looked
at
him
for
a
sell
to
pay
a
porter
out
for
stopping
me
getting
into
a
train
when
it
was
just
starting
and
i
missed
going
to
the
circus
with
the
others
oswald
was
glad
dicky
was
not
too
proud
to
explain
to
the
old
man
he
was
rather
afraid
he
might
be
i
never
sent
it
to
a
girl
he
said
again
ho
said
the
aged
one
an
who
told
you
that
there
porter
was
a
single
man
it
was
his
wife
my
pore
gell
as
opened
your
low
parcel
and
she
sees
your
lying
list
written
out
so
plain
on
top
and
sez
she
to
me
says
she
a
friend
in
need
all
these
good
things
for
us
and
no
name
signed
so
that
we
ca
even
say
thank
you
i
suppose
it
some
one
knows
how
short
we
are
just
now
and
hardly
enough
to
eat
with
coals
the
price
they
are
says
she
to
me
do
call
that
kind
and
christian
says
she
i
wo
open
not
one
of
them
lovely
parcels
till
jim
comes
she
says
we
enjoy
the
pleasures
of
it
together
all
three
of
us
says
she
and
when
he
came
home
we
opened
of
them
lovely
parcels
she
a
cryin
her
eyes
out
at
home
now
and
jim
he
only
swore
once
and
i
do
blame
him
for
that
one
though
never
an
evil
speaker
myself
and
then
he
set
himself
down
on
a
chair
and
puts
his
elbows
on
it
to
hide
his
face
like
and
says
he
help
me
i
did
know
i
got
an
enemy
in
the
world
i
always
thought
we
got
nothing
but
good
friends
says
he
an
i
says
nothing
but
i
picks
up
the
paper
and
comes
here
to
your
fine
house
to
tell
you
what
i
think
of
you
it
a
mean
dirty
nasty
trick
and
no
gentleman
would
it
so
that
all
and
it
off
my
chest
and
to
you
gentlemen
both
he
turned
to
go
out
i
shall
not
tell
you
what
oswald
felt
except
that
he
did
hope
dicky
felt
the
same
and
would
behave
accordingly
and
dicky
did
and
oswald
was
both
pleased
and
surprised
dicky
said
oh
i
say
stop
a
minute
i
did
think
of
your
poor
girl
and
her
youngest
but
a
bare
three
weeks
old
said
the
old
man
angrily
i
did
on
my
honour
i
did
think
of
anything
but
paying
the
porter
out
he
was
only
a
doing
of
his
duty
the
old
man
said
well
i
beg
your
pardon
and
his
said
dicky
it
was
ungentlemanly
and
i
very
sorry
and
i
try
to
make
it
up
somehow
please
make
it
up
i
ca
do
more
than
own
i
sorry
i
wish
i
had
there
well
said
the
old
man
slowly
we
leave
it
at
that
next
time
you
think
a
bit
who
it
going
to
be
as
get
the
benefit
of
your
payings
out
dicky
made
him
shake
hands
and
oswald
did
the
same
then
we
had
to
go
back
to
the
others
and
tell
them
it
was
hard
but
it
was
and
compared
to
having
to
tell
father
which
was
what
it
came
to
in
the
end
for
we
all
saw
though
noël
happened
to
be
the
one
to
say
it
first
that
the
only
way
we
could
really
make
it
up
to
james
johnson
and
his
poor
girl
and
his
poor
girl
father
and
the
baby
that
was
only
three
weeks
old
was
to
send
them
a
hamper
with
all
the
things
in
it
things
that
we
had
put
on
the
list
in
the
revengeful
hamper
and
as
we
had
only
among
us
we
had
to
tell
father
besides
you
feel
better
inside
when
you
have
he
talked
to
us
about
it
a
bit
but
he
is
a
good
father
and
does
not
jaw
unduly
he
advanced
our
to
buy
a
real
large
and
he
gave
us
six
bottles
of
port
wine
because
he
thought
that
would
be
better
for
the
poor
girl
who
had
the
baby
than
rum
or
sherry
or
even
sparkling
champagne
we
were
afraid
to
send
the
hamper
by
carter
pat
for
fear
they
should
think
it
was
another
avenging
and
that
was
one
reason
why
we
took
it
ourselves
in
a
cab
the
other
reason
was
that
we
wanted
to
see
them
open
the
hamper
and
another
was
that
we
wanted
at
least
dicky
wanted
to
have
it
out
man
to
man
with
the
porter
and
his
wife
and
tell
them
himself
how
sorry
he
was
so
we
got
our
gardener
to
find
out
secretly
when
that
porter
was
off
duty
and
when
we
knew
the
times
we
went
to
his
house
at
one
of
them
then
dicky
got
out
of
the
cab
and
went
in
and
said
what
he
had
to
say
and
then
we
took
in
the
hamper
and
the
old
man
and
his
daughter
and
the
porter
were
most
awfully
decent
to
us
and
the
porter
wife
said
lor
let
bygones
be
bygones
is
what
say
why
we
would
never
have
had
this
handsome
present
but
for
the
other
say
no
more
about
it
sir
and
thank
you
kindly
i
sure
and
we
have
been
friends
with
them
ever
since
we
were
short
of
for
some
time
but
oswald
does
not
complain
though
the
turk
was
dicky
idea
entirely
yet
oswald
is
just
and
he
owns
that
he
helped
as
much
as
he
could
in
packing
the
hamper
of
the
avenger
dora
paid
her
share
too
though
she
was
in
it
the
author
does
not
shrink
from
owning
that
this
was
very
decent
of
dora
this
is
all
the
story
of
the
turk
in
chains
or
richard
revenge
his
name
is
really
richard
the
same
as
father
we
only
call
him
dicky
for
short
golden
albert
uncle
is
tremendously
clever
and
he
writes
books
i
have
told
how
he
fled
to
southern
shores
with
a
lady
who
is
rather
nice
his
having
to
marry
her
was
partly
our
fault
but
we
did
not
mean
to
do
it
and
we
were
very
sorry
for
what
we
had
done
but
afterwards
we
thought
perhaps
it
was
all
for
the
best
because
if
left
alone
he
might
have
married
widows
or
old
german
governesses
or
murdstone
aunts
like
daisy
and
denny
have
instead
of
the
fortunate
lady
that
we
were
the
cause
of
his
being
married
by
the
wedding
was
just
before
christmas
and
we
were
all
there
and
then
they
went
to
rome
for
a
period
of
time
that
is
spoken
of
in
books
as
the
honeymoon
you
know
that
my
youngest
brother
tried
to
go
too
disguised
as
the
contents
of
a
but
was
betrayed
and
brought
back
conversation
often
takes
place
about
the
things
you
like
and
we
often
spoke
of
albert
uncle
one
day
we
had
a
ripping
game
of
sometimes
called
and
never
to
be
played
except
when
your
father
and
uncle
are
out
because
of
the
screams
which
the
strongest
can
not
suppress
when
caught
by
he
in
unexpectedness
and
total
darkness
the
girls
do
not
like
this
game
so
much
as
we
do
but
it
is
only
fair
for
them
to
play
it
we
have
more
than
once
played
doll
to
please
them
well
when
the
game
was
over
we
were
panting
like
dogs
on
the
hearthrug
in
front
of
the
fire
and
said
i
wish
albert
uncle
had
been
here
he
does
enjoy
it
so
oswald
has
sometimes
thought
albert
uncle
only
played
to
please
us
but
may
be
right
i
wonder
if
they
often
play
it
in
rome
went
on
that
he
sent
us
with
the
you
know
the
round
place
with
the
arches
they
could
have
ripping
games
there
it
not
much
fun
with
only
two
said
dicky
besides
dora
said
when
people
are
first
married
they
always
sit
in
balconies
and
look
at
the
moon
or
else
at
each
other
eyes
they
ought
to
know
what
their
eyes
look
like
by
this
time
said
dicky
i
believe
they
sit
and
write
poetry
about
their
eyes
all
day
and
only
look
at
each
other
when
they
ca
think
of
the
rhymes
said
noël
i
do
believe
she
knows
how
but
i
certain
they
read
aloud
to
each
other
out
of
the
poetry
books
we
gave
them
for
wedding
presents
alice
said
it
would
be
beastly
ungrateful
if
they
did
especially
with
their
backs
all
covered
with
gold
like
they
are
said
about
those
books
said
oswald
slowly
now
for
the
first
time
joining
in
what
was
being
said
of
course
it
was
jolly
decent
of
father
to
get
such
ripping
presents
for
us
to
give
them
but
i
sometimes
wished
we
given
albert
uncle
a
really
truly
present
that
we
chosen
ourselves
and
bought
with
our
own
chink
i
wish
we
could
have
something
for
him
noël
said
i
have
killed
a
dragon
for
him
as
soon
as
look
at
it
and
albert
uncle
could
have
been
the
princess
and
i
would
have
let
him
have
her
yes
said
dicky
and
we
just
gave
rotten
books
but
it
no
use
grizzling
over
it
now
it
all
over
and
he
wo
get
married
again
while
she
alive
this
was
true
for
we
live
in
england
which
is
a
morganatic
empire
where
more
than
one
wife
at
a
time
is
not
allowed
in
the
glorious
east
he
might
have
married
again
and
again
and
we
could
have
made
it
all
right
about
the
wedding
present
i
wish
he
was
a
turk
for
some
things
said
oswald
and
explained
why
i
do
think
would
like
it
said
dora
oswald
explained
that
if
he
was
a
turk
she
would
be
a
turquoise
i
think
that
is
the
feminine
turk
and
so
would
be
used
to
lots
of
wives
and
be
lonely
without
them
and
just
then
you
know
what
they
say
about
talking
of
angels
and
hearing
their
wings
there
is
another
way
of
saying
this
but
it
is
not
polite
as
the
present
author
knows
well
just
then
the
postman
came
and
of
course
we
rushed
out
and
among
father
dull
letters
we
found
one
addressed
to
the
bastables
junior
it
had
an
italian
stamp
not
at
all
a
rare
one
and
it
was
a
poor
specimen
too
and
the
was
that
is
what
the
italians
have
got
into
the
habit
of
calling
rome
i
have
been
told
that
they
put
the
a
instead
of
the
e
because
they
like
to
open
their
mouths
as
much
as
possible
in
that
sunny
and
agreeable
climate
the
letter
was
jolly
it
was
just
like
hearing
him
talk
i
mean
reading
not
hearing
of
course
but
reading
him
talk
is
not
grammar
and
if
you
ca
be
both
sensible
and
grammarical
it
is
better
to
be
senseless
well
kiddies
it
began
and
it
went
on
to
tell
us
about
things
he
had
seen
not
dull
pictures
and
beastly
old
buildings
but
amusing
incidents
of
comic
nature
the
italians
must
be
extreme
jugginses
for
the
kind
of
things
he
described
to
be
of
such
everyday
occurring
indeed
oswald
could
hardly
believe
about
the
label
that
the
italian
translated
for
the
english
traveller
so
that
it
said
to
distrust
of
the
mineral
waters
too
foaming
they
spread
the
shape
near
the
end
of
the
letter
came
this
you
remember
the
chapter
of
golden
gondola
that
i
wrote
for
the
just
before
i
had
the
honour
to
lead
to
the
altar
i
mean
the
one
that
ends
in
the
subterranean
passage
with
geraldine
hair
down
and
her
last
hope
gone
and
the
three
villains
stealing
upon
her
with
venetian
subtlety
in
their
hearts
and
toledo
daggers
specially
imported
in
their
garters
i
did
care
much
for
it
myself
you
remember
i
think
i
must
have
been
thinking
of
other
things
when
i
wrote
it
but
you
i
recollect
consoled
me
by
refusing
to
regard
it
as
other
than
was
as
i
recall
it
consolatory
epithet
you
weep
with
me
i
feel
confident
when
you
hear
that
my
editor
does
not
share
your
sentiments
he
writes
me
that
it
is
not
up
to
my
usual
form
he
fears
that
the
public
and
he
trusts
that
in
the
next
chapter
let
us
hope
that
the
public
will
in
this
matter
take
your
views
and
not
his
oh
for
a
really
discerning
public
just
like
you
you
amiable
critics
albert
new
aunt
is
leaning
over
my
shoulder
i
ca
break
her
of
the
distracting
habit
how
on
earth
am
i
ever
to
write
another
line
greetings
to
all
from
albert
uncle
and
aunt
she
insists
on
having
her
name
put
to
this
but
of
course
she
did
write
it
i
am
trying
to
teach
her
to
spell
italian
spelling
of
course
and
now
cried
oswald
i
see
it
all
the
others
did
they
often
do
when
oswald
does
why
do
you
see
he
patiently
explained
for
he
knows
that
it
is
vain
to
be
angry
with
people
because
they
are
not
so
clever
as
as
other
people
it
the
direct
aspiration
of
fate
he
wants
it
does
he
well
he
shall
have
it
what
said
everybody
we
be
it
was
the
not
very
polite
remark
now
repeated
by
all
why
his
discerning
public
and
still
they
all
remained
quite
blind
to
what
was
so
clear
to
oswald
the
astute
and
discernful
it
will
be
much
more
useful
than
killing
dragons
oswald
went
on
especially
as
there
are
any
and
it
will
be
a
really
truly
wedding
present
just
what
we
were
wishing
we
given
him
the
five
others
now
fell
on
oswald
and
rolled
him
under
the
table
and
sat
on
his
head
so
that
he
had
to
speak
loudly
and
plainly
illustration
the
five
others
all
right
i
tell
you
in
words
of
one
syllable
if
you
like
let
go
i
say
and
when
he
had
rolled
out
with
the
others
and
the
tablecloth
that
caught
on
boots
and
the
books
and
dora
workbox
and
the
glass
of
that
came
down
with
it
he
said
we
will
the
public
we
will
all
write
to
the
editor
of
the
and
tell
him
what
we
think
about
the
geraldine
chapter
do
mop
up
that
water
dora
it
running
all
under
where
sitting
do
you
think
said
dora
devoting
her
handkerchief
and
alice
in
the
obedient
way
she
does
not
always
use
that
six
letters
all
signed
and
all
coming
from
the
same
house
would
be
rather
rather
a
bit
too
thick
yes
said
alice
but
of
course
we
have
all
different
names
and
addresses
we
might
as
well
do
it
thoroughly
said
dicky
and
send
three
or
four
different
letters
each
and
have
them
posted
in
different
parts
of
london
right
oh
remarked
oswald
shall
write
a
piece
of
poetry
for
mine
said
noël
they
ought
all
to
be
on
different
kinds
of
paper
said
oswald
go
out
and
get
the
paper
directly
after
tea
we
did
but
we
could
only
get
fifteen
different
kinds
of
paper
and
envelopes
though
we
went
to
every
shop
in
the
village
at
the
first
shop
when
we
said
please
we
want
a
of
paper
and
envelopes
of
each
of
all
the
different
kinds
you
keep
the
lady
of
the
shop
looked
at
us
thinly
over
spectacles
and
said
what
for
and
said
to
write
unonymous
letters
anonymous
letters
are
very
wrong
the
lady
said
and
she
would
sell
us
any
paper
at
all
but
at
the
other
places
we
did
not
say
what
it
was
for
and
they
sold
it
us
there
were
bluey
and
yellowy
and
grey
and
white
kinds
and
some
was
violetish
with
violets
on
it
and
some
pink
with
roses
the
girls
took
the
florivorous
ones
which
oswald
thinks
are
unmanly
for
any
but
girls
but
you
excuse
their
using
it
it
seems
natural
to
them
to
mess
about
like
that
we
wrote
the
fifteen
letters
disguising
our
handwritings
as
much
as
we
could
it
was
not
easy
oswald
tried
to
write
one
of
them
with
his
left
hand
but
the
consequences
were
almost
totally
unreadable
besides
if
any
one
could
have
read
it
they
would
only
have
thought
it
was
written
in
an
asylum
for
the
insane
the
writing
was
so
delirious
so
he
chucked
it
noël
was
only
allowed
to
write
one
poem
it
began
oh
geraldine
oh
geraldine
you
are
the
loveliest
heroine
i
never
read
about
one
before
that
made
me
want
to
write
more
poetry
and
your
venetian
eyes
they
must
have
been
an
awful
size
and
black
and
blue
and
like
your
hair
and
your
nose
and
chin
were
a
perfect
pair
and
so
on
for
ages
the
other
letters
were
all
saying
what
a
beautiful
chapter
beneath
the
doge
home
was
and
how
we
liked
it
better
than
the
other
chapters
before
and
how
we
hoped
the
next
would
be
like
it
we
found
out
when
all
too
late
that
had
called
it
the
dog
home
but
we
hoped
this
would
pass
unnoticed
among
all
the
others
we
read
the
reviews
of
books
in
the
old
and
and
put
in
the
words
they
say
there
about
other
people
books
we
said
we
thought
that
chapter
about
geraldine
and
the
garters
was
subtle
and
masterly
and
inevitable
that
it
had
an
charm
and
was
redolent
of
the
soil
we
said
too
that
we
had
read
it
with
breathless
interest
from
cover
to
cover
and
that
it
had
poignant
pathos
and
a
convincing
realism
and
the
fine
flower
of
delicate
sentiment
besides
much
other
rot
that
the
author
ca
remember
when
all
the
letters
were
done
we
addressed
them
and
stamped
them
and
licked
them
down
and
then
we
got
different
people
to
post
them
our
who
lives
in
greenwich
and
the
other
who
lives
in
lewisham
and
the
servants
on
their
evenings
out
which
they
spend
in
distant
spots
like
plaistow
and
grove
park
each
had
a
letter
to
post
the
was
a
great
catch
he
lived
in
highgate
and
the
man
was
lambeth
so
we
got
rid
of
all
the
letters
and
watched
the
post
for
a
reply
we
watched
for
a
week
but
no
answer
came
you
think
perhaps
that
we
were
duffers
to
watch
for
a
reply
when
we
had
signed
all
the
letters
with
fancy
names
like
daisy
dolman
everard
maur
and
sir
cholmondely
marjoribanks
and
put
fancy
addresses
on
them
like
chatsworth
house
loampit
vale
and
the
bungalow
eaton
square
but
we
were
not
such
idiots
as
you
think
dear
reader
and
you
are
not
so
extra
clever
as
you
think
either
we
had
written
letter
it
had
the
grandest
words
in
it
on
our
own
with
the
address
on
the
top
and
the
uncle
outside
the
envelope
oswald
real
own
name
was
signed
to
this
letter
and
this
was
the
one
we
looked
for
the
answer
to
see
but
that
answer
did
not
come
and
when
three
long
days
had
passed
away
we
all
felt
most
awfully
stale
about
it
knowing
the
great
good
we
had
done
for
albert
uncle
made
our
interior
feelings
very
little
better
if
at
all
and
on
the
fourth
day
oswald
spoke
up
and
said
what
was
in
inside
heart
he
said
this
is
futile
rot
i
vote
we
write
and
ask
that
editor
why
he
answer
letters
he
would
answer
that
one
any
more
than
he
did
the
other
said
noël
why
should
he
he
knows
you
ca
do
anything
to
him
for
not
why
should
we
go
and
ask
him
said
he
could
not
answer
us
if
we
was
all
there
staring
him
in
the
face
i
do
suppose
he
see
you
said
dora
and
it
not
the
other
editor
did
when
i
got
the
guinea
for
my
beautiful
poems
noël
reminded
us
yes
said
the
thoughtful
oswald
but
then
it
does
matter
how
young
you
are
when
you
just
a
but
we
the
discerning
public
now
and
he
think
we
ought
to
be
grown
up
i
say
dora
suppose
you
rigged
yourself
up
in
old
blakie
things
you
look
quite
twenty
or
thirty
dora
looked
frightened
and
said
she
thought
we
better
not
but
alice
said
well
i
will
then
i
do
care
i
as
tall
as
dora
but
i
wo
go
alone
oswald
you
have
to
dress
up
old
and
come
too
it
not
much
to
do
for
albert
uncle
sake
you
know
you
enjoy
it
said
dora
and
she
may
have
wished
that
she
did
not
so
often
think
that
we
had
better
not
however
the
dye
was
now
cast
and
the
remainder
of
this
adventure
was
doomed
to
be
coloured
by
the
dye
we
now
prepared
this
is
an
allegory
it
means
we
had
burned
our
boats
and
that
is
another
we
decided
to
do
the
deed
next
day
and
during
the
evening
dicky
and
oswald
went
out
and
bought
a
grey
beard
and
moustache
which
was
the
only
thing
we
could
think
of
to
disguise
the
manly
and
youthful
form
of
the
bold
oswald
into
the
mature
shape
of
a
and
discerning
public
character
meanwhile
the
girls
made
tiptoe
and
excursions
into
miss
blake
room
she
is
the
housekeeper
and
got
several
things
among
others
a
sort
of
undecided
thing
like
part
of
a
wig
which
miss
blake
wears
on
sundays
jane
our
housemaid
says
it
is
called
a
transformation
and
that
duchesses
wear
them
we
had
to
be
very
secret
about
the
that
night
and
to
put
blakie
things
all
back
when
they
had
been
tried
on
dora
did
alice
hair
she
twisted
up
what
little
hair
alice
has
got
by
natural
means
and
tied
on
a
long
tail
of
hair
that
was
miss
too
then
she
twisted
that
up
with
many
hairpins
then
the
wiglet
or
transformation
was
plastered
over
the
front
part
and
miss
blake
sunday
hat
which
is
of
a
very
brisk
character
with
half
a
blue
bird
in
it
was
placed
on
top
of
everything
there
were
several
petticoats
used
and
a
brown
dress
and
some
stockings
and
hankies
to
stuff
it
out
where
it
was
too
big
a
black
jacket
and
crimson
tie
completed
the
picture
we
thought
alice
would
do
then
oswald
went
out
of
the
room
and
secretly
assumed
his
dark
disguise
but
when
he
came
in
with
the
beard
on
and
a
hat
of
father
the
others
were
not
struck
with
admiration
and
respect
like
he
meant
them
to
be
they
rolled
about
roaring
with
laughter
and
when
he
crept
into
miss
blake
room
and
turned
up
the
gas
a
bit
and
looked
in
her
long
glass
he
owned
that
they
were
right
and
that
it
was
no
go
he
is
tall
for
his
age
but
that
beard
made
him
look
like
some
horrible
dwarf
and
his
hair
being
so
short
added
to
everything
any
idiot
could
have
seen
that
the
beard
had
not
originally
flourished
where
it
now
was
but
had
been
transplanted
from
some
other
place
of
growth
and
when
he
laughed
which
now
became
necessary
he
really
did
look
most
awful
he
has
read
of
beards
wagging
but
he
never
saw
it
before
while
he
was
looking
at
himself
the
girls
had
thought
of
a
new
idea
but
oswald
had
an
inside
presentiment
that
made
it
some
time
before
he
could
even
consent
to
listen
to
it
but
at
last
when
the
others
reminded
him
that
it
was
a
noble
act
and
for
the
good
of
uncle
he
let
them
explain
the
horrid
scheme
in
all
its
lurid
parts
it
was
this
that
oswald
should
consent
to
be
disguised
in
raiments
and
go
with
alice
to
see
the
editor
no
man
ever
wants
to
be
a
woman
and
it
was
a
bitter
thing
for
pride
but
at
last
he
consented
he
is
glad
he
is
not
a
girl
you
have
no
idea
what
it
is
like
to
wear
petticoats
especially
long
ones
i
wonder
that
ladies
continue
to
endure
their
miserable
existences
the
top
parts
of
the
clothes
too
seemed
to
be
too
tight
and
too
loose
in
the
wrong
places
oswald
head
also
was
terribly
in
the
way
he
had
no
wandering
hairs
to
fasten
transformations
on
to
even
if
miss
blake
had
had
another
one
which
was
not
the
case
but
the
girls
remembered
a
governess
they
had
once
witnessed
whose
hair
was
brief
as
any
boy
so
they
put
a
large
hat
with
a
very
tight
elastic
behind
on
to
head
just
as
it
was
and
then
with
a
tickly
pussyish
featherish
thing
round
his
neck
hanging
wobblily
down
in
long
ends
he
looked
more
than
he
will
ever
feel
some
courage
was
needed
for
the
start
next
day
things
look
so
different
in
the
daylight
remember
lord
nithsdale
coming
out
of
the
tower
said
alice
think
of
the
great
cause
and
be
brave
and
she
tied
his
neck
up
i
brave
all
right
said
oswald
only
i
do
feel
such
an
ass
i
feel
rather
an
ape
myself
alice
owned
but
i
got
of
peppermints
to
inspire
us
with
bravery
it
is
called
dutch
courage
i
believe
owing
to
our
telling
jane
we
managed
to
get
out
unseen
by
blakie
all
the
others
would
come
too
in
their
natural
appearance
except
that
we
made
them
wash
their
hands
and
faces
we
happened
to
be
flush
of
chink
so
we
let
them
come
but
if
you
do
oswald
said
you
must
surround
us
in
a
hollow
square
of
four
so
they
did
and
we
got
down
to
the
station
all
right
but
in
the
train
there
were
two
ladies
who
stared
and
porters
and
people
like
that
came
round
the
window
far
more
than
there
could
be
any
need
for
boots
must
have
shown
as
he
got
in
he
had
forgotten
to
borrow
a
pair
of
jane
as
he
had
meant
to
and
the
ones
he
had
on
were
his
largest
his
ears
got
hotter
and
hotter
and
it
got
more
and
more
difficult
to
manage
his
feet
and
hands
he
failed
to
suck
any
courage
of
any
nation
from
the
peppermints
illustration
oswald
saw
the
driver
wink
as
he
put
his
boot
on
the
step
and
the
porter
who
was
opening
the
cab
door
winked
back
owing
to
the
state
oswald
ears
were
now
in
we
agreed
to
take
a
cab
at
cannon
street
we
all
crammed
in
somehow
but
oswald
saw
the
driver
wink
as
he
put
his
boot
on
the
step
and
the
porter
who
was
opening
the
cab
door
winked
back
and
i
am
sorry
to
say
oswald
forgot
that
he
was
a
lady
and
he
told
the
porter
that
he
had
better
jolly
well
stow
his
cheek
then
several
bystanders
began
to
try
and
be
funny
and
oswald
knew
exactly
what
particular
sort
of
fool
he
was
being
but
he
bravely
silenced
the
fierce
warnings
of
his
ears
and
when
we
got
to
the
editor
address
we
sent
dick
up
with
a
large
card
that
we
had
written
on
miss
daisy
dolman
and
the
right
honourable
miss
etheltruda
bustler
on
urgent
business
and
oswald
kept
himself
and
alice
concealed
in
the
cab
till
the
return
of
the
messenger
all
right
you
to
go
up
dicky
came
back
and
said
but
the
boy
grinned
who
told
me
so
you
better
be
jolly
careful
we
bolted
like
rabbits
across
the
pavement
and
up
the
editor
stairs
he
was
very
polite
he
asked
us
to
sit
down
and
oswald
did
but
first
he
tumbled
over
the
front
of
his
dress
because
it
would
get
under
his
boots
and
he
was
afraid
to
hold
it
up
not
having
practised
doing
this
i
think
i
have
had
letters
from
you
said
the
editor
illustration
he
looked
at
oswald
boots
alice
who
looked
terrible
with
the
transformation
leaning
said
yes
and
that
we
had
come
to
say
what
a
fine
bold
conception
we
thought
the
doge
chapter
was
this
was
what
we
had
settled
to
say
but
she
need
have
burst
out
with
it
like
that
i
suppose
she
forgot
herself
oswald
in
the
agitation
of
his
clothes
could
say
nothing
the
elastic
of
the
hat
seemed
to
be
very
slowly
slipping
up
the
back
of
his
head
and
he
knew
that
if
it
once
passed
the
bump
that
backs
of
heads
are
made
with
the
hat
would
spring
from
his
head
like
an
arrow
from
a
bow
and
all
would
be
frustrated
yes
said
the
editor
that
chapter
seems
to
have
had
a
great
success
a
wonderful
success
i
had
no
fewer
than
sixteen
letters
about
it
all
praising
it
in
unmeasured
terms
he
looked
at
oswald
boots
which
oswald
had
neglected
to
cover
over
with
his
petticoats
he
now
did
this
it
a
nice
story
you
know
said
alice
timidly
so
it
seems
the
gentleman
went
on
fourteen
of
the
sixteen
letters
bear
the
blackheath
postmark
the
enthusiasm
for
the
chapter
would
seem
to
be
mainly
local
oswald
would
not
look
at
alice
he
could
not
trust
himself
with
her
looking
like
she
did
he
knew
at
once
that
only
the
and
the
electric
bell
man
had
been
faithful
to
their
trust
the
others
had
all
posted
their
letters
in
the
just
outside
our
gate
they
wanted
to
get
rid
of
them
as
quickly
as
they
could
i
suppose
selfishness
is
a
vile
quality
the
author
can
not
deny
that
oswald
now
wished
he
had
the
elastic
was
certainly
moving
slowly
but
too
surely
oswald
tried
to
check
its
career
by
swelling
out
the
bump
on
the
back
of
his
head
but
he
could
not
think
of
the
right
way
to
do
this
i
am
very
pleased
to
see
you
the
editor
went
on
slowly
and
there
was
something
about
the
way
he
spoke
that
made
oswald
think
of
a
cat
playing
with
a
mouse
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
are
there
many
spiritualists
in
blackheath
many
clairvoyants
eh
said
alice
forgetting
that
that
is
not
the
way
to
behave
people
who
foretell
the
future
he
said
i
do
think
so
said
alice
why
his
eye
twinkled
oswald
saw
he
had
wanted
her
to
ask
this
because
said
the
editor
more
slowly
than
ever
i
think
there
must
be
how
otherwise
can
we
account
for
that
chapter
about
the
home
being
read
and
admired
by
sixteen
different
people
before
it
is
even
printed
that
chapter
has
not
been
printed
it
has
not
been
published
it
will
not
be
published
till
the
may
number
of
the
yet
in
blackheath
sixteen
people
already
appreciate
its
subtlety
and
its
realism
and
all
the
rest
of
it
how
do
you
account
for
this
miss
daisy
dolman
i
am
the
right
honourable
etheltruda
said
alice
at
least
oh
no
use
going
on
we
are
not
what
we
seem
oddly
enough
i
inferred
that
at
the
very
beginning
of
our
interview
said
the
editor
then
the
elastic
finished
slipping
up
oswald
head
at
the
back
and
the
hat
leapt
from
his
head
exactly
as
he
had
known
it
would
he
fielded
it
deftly
however
and
it
did
not
touch
the
ground
concealment
said
oswald
is
at
an
end
so
it
appears
said
the
editor
well
i
hope
next
time
the
author
of
the
gondola
will
choose
his
instruments
more
carefully
he
did
we
are
cried
alice
and
she
instantly
told
the
editor
everything
concealment
being
at
an
end
oswald
was
able
to
get
at
his
trousers
pocket
it
did
not
matter
now
how
many
boots
he
showed
and
to
get
out
albert
uncle
letter
alice
was
quite
eloquent
especially
when
the
editor
had
made
her
take
off
the
hat
with
the
blue
bird
and
the
transformation
and
the
tail
so
that
he
could
see
what
she
really
looked
like
he
was
quite
decent
when
he
really
understood
how
albert
uncle
threatened
marriage
must
have
upset
his
brain
while
he
was
writing
that
chapter
and
pondering
on
the
dark
future
he
began
to
laugh
then
and
kept
it
up
till
the
hour
of
parting
he
advised
alice
not
to
put
on
the
transformation
and
the
tail
again
to
go
home
in
and
she
did
then
he
said
to
me
are
you
in
a
finished
state
under
miss
daisy
dolman
and
when
oswald
said
yes
the
editor
helped
him
to
take
off
all
the
womanly
accoutrements
and
to
do
them
up
in
brown
paper
and
he
lent
him
a
cap
to
go
home
in
i
never
saw
a
man
laugh
more
he
is
an
excellent
sort
but
no
slow
passage
of
years
however
many
can
ever
weaken
memory
of
what
those
petticoats
were
like
to
walk
in
and
how
ripping
it
was
to
get
out
of
them
and
have
your
own
natural
legs
again
we
parted
from
that
editor
without
a
strain
on
anybody
character
he
must
have
written
to
albert
uncle
and
told
him
all
for
we
got
a
letter
next
week
it
said
my
dear
kiddies
art
can
not
be
forced
nor
can
fame
may
i
beg
you
for
the
future
to
confine
your
exertions
to
blowing
my
trumpet
or
fame
with
your
natural
voices
editors
may
be
led
but
they
wo
be
druv
the
right
honourable
miss
etheltruda
bustler
seems
to
have
aroused
a
deep
pity
for
me
in
my
editor
heart
let
that
suffice
and
for
the
future
permit
me
as
firmly
as
affectionately
to
reiterate
the
assurance
and
the
advice
which
i
have
so
often
breathed
in
your
long
young
ears
am
not
ungrateful
but
i
do
wish
you
would
mind
your
own
that
just
because
we
were
found
out
said
alice
if
we
succeeded
he
have
been
sitting
on
the
top
of
the
pinnacle
of
fame
and
he
would
have
owed
it
all
to
us
that
would
have
been
making
him
something
like
a
wedding
present
what
we
had
really
done
was
to
make
something
very
like
but
the
author
is
sure
he
has
said
enough
flying
father
knows
a
man
called
eustace
sandal
i
do
not
know
how
to
express
his
inside
soul
but
i
have
heard
father
say
he
means
well
he
is
a
vegetarian
and
a
primitive
social
something
and
an
and
things
like
that
and
he
is
really
as
good
as
he
can
stick
only
most
awfully
dull
i
believe
he
eats
bread
and
milk
from
choice
well
he
has
great
magnificent
dreams
about
all
the
things
you
can
do
for
other
people
and
he
wants
to
distill
cultivatedness
into
the
sort
of
people
who
live
in
model
workmen
dwellings
and
teach
them
to
live
up
to
better
things
this
is
what
he
says
so
he
gives
concerts
in
camberwell
and
places
like
that
and
curates
come
from
far
and
near
to
sing
about
bold
bandaleros
and
the
song
of
the
bow
and
people
who
have
escaped
being
curates
give
comic
recitings
and
he
is
sure
that
it
does
every
one
good
and
gives
them
glimpses
of
the
life
beautiful
he
said
that
oswald
heard
him
with
his
own
trustworthy
ears
anyway
the
people
enjoy
the
concerts
no
end
and
that
the
great
thing
well
he
came
one
night
with
a
lot
of
tickets
he
wanted
to
sell
and
father
bought
some
for
the
servants
and
dora
happened
to
go
in
to
get
the
gum
for
a
kite
we
were
making
and
sandal
said
well
my
little
maiden
would
you
not
like
to
come
on
thursday
evening
and
share
in
the
task
of
raising
our
poor
brothers
and
sisters
to
the
higher
levels
of
culture
so
of
course
dora
said
she
would
very
much
then
he
explained
about
the
concert
calling
her
my
little
one
and
dear
child
which
alice
never
would
have
borne
but
dora
is
not
of
a
sensitive
nature
and
hardly
minds
what
she
is
called
so
long
as
it
is
not
names
which
she
does
not
deem
dear
child
and
cetera
to
be
though
oswald
would
dora
was
quite
excited
about
it
and
the
stranger
so
worked
upon
her
feelings
that
she
accepted
the
deep
responsibility
of
selling
tickets
and
for
a
week
there
was
no
bearing
her
i
believe
she
did
sell
nine
to
people
in
lewisham
and
new
cross
who
knew
no
better
and
father
bought
tickets
for
all
of
us
and
when
the
eventful
evening
dawned
we
went
to
camberwell
by
train
and
tram
miss
blake
that
means
we
have
been
allowed
to
go
without
her
the
tram
ride
was
rather
jolly
but
when
we
got
out
and
walked
we
felt
like
alone
in
london
or
jessica
first
prayer
because
camberwell
is
a
devastating
region
that
makes
you
think
of
rickety
attics
with
the
wind
whistling
through
them
or
miserable
cellars
where
forsaken
children
do
wonders
by
pawning
their
relations
clothes
and
looking
after
the
baby
it
was
a
dampish
night
and
we
walked
on
greasy
mud
and
as
we
walked
along
alice
kicked
against
something
on
the
pavement
and
it
chinked
and
when
she
picked
it
up
it
was
five
bob
rolled
up
in
newspaper
i
expect
it
somebody
little
all
said
alice
and
the
cup
was
dashed
from
their
lips
just
when
they
were
going
to
joyfully
spend
it
we
ought
to
give
it
to
the
police
but
miss
blake
said
no
and
that
we
were
late
already
so
we
went
on
and
alice
held
the
packet
in
her
muff
throughout
the
concert
which
ensued
i
will
not
tell
you
anything
about
the
concert
except
that
it
was
quite
fairly
jolly
you
must
have
been
to
these
concerts
in
the
course
of
your
young
lives
when
it
was
over
we
reasoned
with
miss
blake
and
she
let
us
go
through
the
light
blue
paper
door
beside
the
stage
and
find
sandal
we
thought
he
might
happen
to
hear
who
had
lost
the
five
bob
and
return
it
to
its
sorrowing
family
he
was
in
a
great
hurry
but
he
took
the
chink
and
said
he
let
us
know
if
anything
happened
then
we
went
home
very
cheerful
singing
bits
of
the
comic
songs
a
bishop
son
had
done
in
the
concert
and
little
thinking
what
we
were
taking
home
with
us
it
was
only
a
few
days
after
this
or
perhaps
a
week
that
we
all
began
to
be
rather
cross
alice
usually
as
near
a
brick
as
a
girl
can
go
was
the
worst
of
the
lot
and
if
you
said
what
you
thought
of
her
she
instantly
began
to
snivel
and
we
all
had
awful
colds
and
our
handkerchiefs
gave
out
and
then
our
heads
ached
oswald
head
was
particularly
hot
i
remember
and
he
wanted
to
rest
it
on
the
backs
of
chairs
or
on
tables
or
anything
steady
but
why
prolong
the
painful
narrative
what
we
had
brought
home
from
camberwell
was
the
measles
and
as
soon
as
the
recognised
the
grim
intruder
for
the
fell
disease
it
is
we
all
went
to
bed
and
there
was
an
end
of
active
adventure
for
some
time
of
course
when
you
begin
to
get
better
there
are
grapes
and
other
luxuries
not
of
everyday
occurrences
but
while
you
sniffling
and
fevering
in
bed
as
red
as
a
lobster
and
blazing
hot
you
are
inclined
to
think
it
is
a
heavy
price
to
pay
for
any
concert
however
raising
sandal
came
to
see
father
the
very
day
we
all
marched
bedward
he
had
found
the
owner
of
the
five
shillings
it
was
a
doctor
fee
about
to
be
paid
by
the
parent
of
a
thoroughly
measly
family
and
if
we
had
taken
it
to
the
police
at
once
alice
would
not
have
held
it
in
her
hand
all
through
the
concert
but
i
will
not
blame
blakie
she
was
a
jolly
good
nurse
and
read
aloud
to
us
with
unfatiguable
industry
while
we
were
getting
better
our
having
fallen
victims
to
this
disgusting
complaint
ended
in
our
being
sent
to
the
seaside
father
could
not
take
us
himself
so
we
went
to
stay
with
a
sister
of
sandal
she
was
like
him
only
more
so
in
every
way
the
journey
was
very
joyous
father
saw
us
off
at
cannon
street
and
we
had
a
carriage
to
ourselves
all
the
way
and
we
passed
the
station
where
oswald
would
not
like
to
be
a
porter
rude
boys
at
this
station
put
their
heads
out
of
the
window
and
shout
who
a
duffer
and
things
like
that
and
the
porters
to
shout
i
am
because
higham
is
the
name
of
the
station
and
porters
have
seldom
any
h
with
which
to
protect
themselves
from
this
cruel
joke
it
was
a
glorious
moment
when
the
train
swooped
out
of
a
tunnel
and
we
looked
over
the
downs
and
saw
the
line
that
was
the
sea
we
had
not
seen
the
sea
since
before
mother
died
i
believe
we
older
ones
all
thought
of
that
and
it
made
us
quieter
than
the
younger
ones
were
i
do
not
want
to
forget
anything
but
it
makes
you
feel
empty
and
stupid
when
you
remember
some
things
there
was
a
good
drive
in
a
waggonette
after
we
got
to
our
station
there
were
primroses
under
some
of
the
hedges
and
lots
of
and
at
last
we
got
to
miss
sandal
house
it
is
before
you
come
to
the
village
and
it
is
a
little
square
white
house
there
is
a
big
old
windmill
at
the
back
of
it
it
is
not
used
any
more
for
grinding
corn
but
fishermen
keep
their
nets
in
it
miss
sandal
came
out
of
the
green
gate
to
meet
us
she
had
a
soft
drab
dress
and
a
long
thin
neck
and
her
hair
was
drab
too
and
it
was
screwed
up
tight
she
said
welcome
one
and
all
in
a
kind
voice
but
it
was
too
much
like
sandal
for
me
and
we
went
in
she
showed
us
the
and
the
rooms
where
we
were
to
sleep
and
then
she
left
us
to
wash
our
hands
and
faces
when
we
were
alone
we
burst
open
the
doors
of
our
rooms
with
one
consent
and
met
on
the
landing
with
a
rush
like
the
great
rivers
of
america
said
oswald
and
the
others
said
the
same
of
all
the
rummy
cribs
remarked
dicky
it
like
a
workhouse
or
a
hospital
said
dora
i
think
i
like
it
it
makes
me
think
of
gentlemen
said
it
is
so
bare
it
was
all
the
walls
were
white
plaster
the
furniture
was
white
deal
what
there
was
of
it
which
was
precious
little
there
were
no
carpets
only
white
matting
and
there
was
not
a
single
ornament
in
a
single
room
there
was
a
clock
on
the
but
that
could
not
be
counted
as
an
ornament
because
of
the
useful
side
of
its
character
there
were
only
about
six
pictures
all
of
a
brownish
colour
one
was
the
blind
girl
sitting
on
an
orange
with
a
broken
fiddle
it
is
called
hope
when
we
were
clean
miss
sandal
gave
us
tea
as
we
sat
down
she
said
the
motto
of
our
little
household
is
living
and
high
thinking
and
some
of
us
feared
for
an
instant
that
this
might
mean
not
enough
to
eat
but
fortunately
this
was
not
the
case
there
was
plenty
but
all
of
a
milky
bunny
fruity
vegetable
sort
we
soon
got
used
to
it
and
liked
it
all
right
miss
sandal
was
very
kind
she
offered
to
read
aloud
to
us
after
tea
and
exchanging
glances
of
despair
some
of
us
said
that
we
should
like
it
very
much
it
was
oswald
who
found
the
manly
courage
to
say
very
politely
would
it
be
all
the
same
to
you
if
we
went
and
looked
at
the
sea
first
because
and
she
said
not
at
all
adding
something
about
nature
the
dear
old
nurse
taking
somebody
on
her
knee
and
let
us
go
we
asked
her
which
way
and
we
tore
up
the
road
and
through
the
village
and
on
to
the
and
then
with
six
joyous
bounds
we
leaped
down
on
to
the
sand
the
author
will
not
bother
you
with
a
description
of
the
mighty
billows
of
ocean
which
you
must
have
read
about
if
not
seen
but
he
will
just
say
what
perhaps
you
are
not
aware
of
that
seagulls
eat
clams
and
mussels
and
cockles
and
crack
the
shells
with
their
beaks
the
author
has
seen
this
done
you
also
know
i
suppose
that
you
can
dig
in
the
sand
if
you
have
a
spade
and
make
sand
castles
and
stay
in
them
till
the
tide
washes
you
out
i
will
say
no
more
except
that
when
we
gazed
upon
the
sea
and
the
sand
we
felt
we
did
not
care
tuppence
how
highly
miss
sandal
might
think
of
us
or
how
plainly
she
might
make
us
live
so
long
as
we
had
got
the
briny
deep
to
go
down
to
it
was
too
early
in
the
year
and
too
late
in
the
day
to
bathe
but
we
paddled
which
comes
to
much
the
same
thing
and
you
almost
always
have
to
change
everything
afterwards
when
it
got
dark
we
had
to
go
back
to
the
white
house
and
there
was
supper
and
then
we
found
that
miss
sandal
did
not
keep
a
servant
so
of
course
we
offered
to
help
wash
up
only
broke
two
plates
nothing
worth
telling
about
happened
till
we
had
been
there
over
a
week
and
had
got
to
know
the
coastguards
and
a
lot
of
the
village
people
quite
well
i
do
like
coastguards
they
seem
to
know
everything
you
want
to
hear
about
miss
sandal
used
to
read
to
us
out
of
poetry
books
and
about
a
chap
called
thoreau
who
could
tickle
fish
and
they
liked
it
and
let
him
she
was
kind
but
rather
like
her
house
there
was
something
bare
and
bald
about
her
inside
mind
i
believe
she
was
very
very
calm
and
said
that
people
who
lost
their
tempers
were
not
living
the
higher
life
but
one
day
a
telegram
came
and
then
she
was
not
calm
at
all
she
got
quite
like
other
people
and
quite
shoved
for
getting
in
her
way
when
she
was
looking
for
her
purse
to
pay
for
the
answer
to
the
telegram
then
she
said
to
dora
and
she
was
pale
and
her
eyes
red
just
like
people
who
live
the
lower
or
ordinary
life
my
dears
it
dreadful
my
poor
brother
he
had
a
fall
i
must
go
to
him
at
and
she
sent
oswald
to
order
the
fly
from
the
old
ship
hotel
and
the
girls
to
see
if
beale
would
come
and
take
care
of
us
while
she
was
away
then
she
kissed
us
all
and
went
off
very
unhappy
we
heard
afterwards
that
poor
worthy
sandal
had
climbed
a
scaffolding
to
give
a
workman
a
tract
about
drink
and
he
did
know
the
proper
part
of
the
scaffolding
to
stand
on
the
workman
did
of
course
so
he
fetched
down
half
a
dozen
planks
and
the
workman
and
if
a
had
happened
to
be
passing
just
under
so
that
they
fell
into
it
their
lives
would
not
have
been
spared
as
it
was
sandal
broke
his
arm
and
his
head
the
workman
escaped
unscathed
but
furious
the
workman
was
a
teetotaler
beale
came
and
the
first
thing
she
did
was
to
buy
a
leg
of
mutton
and
cook
it
it
was
the
first
meat
we
had
had
since
arriving
at
lymchurch
illustration
he
fetched
down
half
a
dozen
planks
and
the
workman
i
she
ca
afford
good
butcher
meat
said
beale
but
your
pa
i
expect
he
pays
for
you
and
i
lay
he
like
you
to
have
your
fill
of
something
as
lay
acrost
your
chesties
so
she
made
a
yorkshire
pudding
as
well
it
was
good
after
dinner
we
sat
on
the
feeling
more
like
after
dinner
than
we
had
felt
for
days
and
dora
said
poor
miss
sandal
i
never
thought
about
her
being
somehow
i
wish
we
could
do
something
to
help
her
we
might
go
out
noël
said
but
that
was
no
good
because
there
is
only
one
street
in
the
village
and
the
people
there
are
much
too
poor
for
one
to
be
able
to
ask
them
for
anything
and
all
round
it
is
fields
with
only
sheep
who
have
nothing
to
give
except
their
wool
and
when
it
comes
to
taking
that
they
are
never
asked
dora
thought
we
might
get
father
to
give
her
money
but
oswald
knew
this
would
never
do
then
suddenly
a
thought
struck
some
one
i
will
not
say
who
and
that
some
one
said
she
ought
to
let
lodgings
like
all
the
other
people
do
in
lymchurch
that
was
the
beginning
of
it
the
end
for
that
day
was
our
getting
the
top
of
a
cardboard
box
and
printing
on
it
the
following
lines
in
as
many
different
coloured
chalks
as
we
happened
to
have
with
us
lodgings
to
let
enquire
inside
we
ruled
spaces
for
the
letters
to
go
in
and
did
it
very
neatly
when
we
went
to
bed
we
stuck
it
in
our
bedroom
window
with
in
the
morning
when
oswald
drew
up
his
blind
there
was
quite
a
crowd
of
kids
looking
at
the
card
beale
came
out
and
them
away
as
if
they
were
hens
and
we
did
not
have
to
explain
the
card
to
her
at
all
she
never
said
anything
about
it
i
never
knew
such
a
woman
as
beale
for
minding
her
own
business
she
said
afterwards
she
supposed
miss
sandal
had
told
us
to
put
up
the
card
well
two
or
three
days
went
by
and
nothing
happened
only
we
had
a
letter
from
miss
sandal
telling
us
how
the
poor
sufferer
was
groaning
and
one
from
father
telling
us
to
be
good
children
and
not
get
into
scrapes
and
people
who
drove
by
used
to
look
at
the
card
and
laugh
and
then
one
day
a
carriage
came
driving
up
with
a
gentleman
in
it
and
he
saw
the
rainbow
beauty
of
our
chalked
card
and
he
got
out
and
came
up
the
path
he
had
a
pale
face
and
white
hair
and
very
bright
eyes
that
moved
about
quickly
like
a
bird
and
he
was
dressed
in
a
quite
new
tweed
suit
that
did
not
fit
him
very
well
dora
and
alice
answered
the
door
before
any
one
had
time
to
knock
and
the
author
has
reason
to
believe
their
hearts
were
beating
wildly
how
much
said
the
gentleman
shortly
alice
and
dora
were
so
surprised
by
his
suddenness
that
they
could
only
reply
er
er
just
so
said
the
gentleman
briskly
as
oswald
stepped
modestly
forward
and
said
wo
you
come
inside
the
very
thing
said
he
and
came
in
we
showed
him
into
the
and
asked
him
to
excuse
us
a
minute
and
then
held
a
breathless
council
outside
the
door
it
depends
how
many
rooms
he
wants
said
dora
let
say
so
much
a
room
said
dicky
and
extra
if
he
wants
beale
to
wait
on
him
so
we
decided
to
do
this
we
thought
a
pound
a
room
seemed
fair
and
we
went
back
how
many
rooms
do
you
want
oswald
asked
all
the
room
there
is
said
the
gentleman
they
are
a
pound
each
said
oswald
and
extra
for
mrs
beale
how
much
altogether
oswald
thought
a
minute
and
then
said
nine
rooms
is
nine
pounds
and
two
pounds
a
week
for
beale
because
she
is
a
widow
illustration
how
much
said
the
gentleman
shortly
done
said
the
gentleman
i
go
and
fetch
my
portmanteaus
he
bounced
up
and
out
and
got
into
his
carriage
and
drove
away
it
was
not
till
he
was
finally
gone
quite
beyond
recall
that
alice
suddenly
said
but
if
he
has
all
the
rooms
where
are
to
sleep
he
must
be
awfully
rich
said
wanting
all
those
rooms
well
he
ca
sleep
in
more
than
one
at
once
said
dicky
however
rich
he
is
we
might
wait
till
he
was
bedded
down
and
then
sleep
in
the
rooms
he
did
want
but
oswald
was
firm
he
knew
that
if
the
man
paid
for
the
rooms
he
must
have
them
to
himself
he
wo
sleep
in
the
kitchen
said
dora
could
we
sleep
there
but
we
all
said
we
could
and
would
then
alice
suddenly
said
i
know
the
mill
there
are
heaps
and
heaps
of
there
and
we
could
each
take
a
blanket
like
indians
and
creep
over
under
cover
of
the
night
after
the
beale
has
gone
and
get
back
before
she
comes
in
the
morning
it
seemed
a
sporting
thing
to
do
and
we
agreed
only
dora
said
she
thought
it
would
be
draughty
of
course
we
went
over
to
the
mill
at
once
to
lay
our
plans
and
prepare
for
the
silent
watches
of
the
night
there
are
three
stories
to
a
windmill
besides
the
the
first
floor
is
pretty
empty
the
next
is
nearly
full
of
millstones
and
machinery
and
the
one
above
is
where
the
corn
runs
down
from
on
to
the
millstones
we
settled
to
let
the
girls
have
the
first
floor
which
was
covered
with
heaps
of
nets
and
we
would
pig
in
with
the
millstones
on
the
floor
above
we
had
just
secretly
got
out
the
last
of
the
six
blankets
from
the
house
and
got
it
into
the
mill
disguised
in
a
when
we
heard
wheels
and
there
was
the
gentleman
back
again
he
had
only
got
one
portmanteau
after
all
and
that
was
a
very
little
one
beale
was
bobbing
at
him
in
the
doorway
when
we
got
up
of
course
we
had
told
her
he
had
rented
rooms
but
we
had
not
said
how
many
for
fear
she
should
ask
where
we
were
going
to
sleep
and
we
had
a
feeling
that
but
few
would
like
our
sleeping
in
a
mill
however
much
we
were
living
the
higher
life
by
sacrificing
ourselves
to
get
money
for
miss
sandal
the
gentleman
ordered
and
trotters
for
dinner
and
when
he
found
he
could
not
have
that
he
said
gammon
and
spinach
but
there
was
not
any
spinach
in
the
village
so
he
had
to
fall
back
on
eggs
and
bacon
beale
cooked
it
and
when
he
had
fallen
back
on
it
she
washed
up
and
went
home
and
we
were
left
we
could
hear
the
gentleman
singing
to
himself
something
about
woulding
he
was
a
bird
that
he
might
fly
to
thee
then
we
got
the
lanterns
that
you
take
when
you
go
up
street
on
a
dark
night
and
we
crept
over
to
the
mill
it
was
much
darker
than
we
expected
we
decided
to
keep
our
clothes
on
partly
for
warmness
and
partly
in
case
of
any
sudden
alarm
or
the
fishermen
wanting
their
nets
in
the
middle
of
the
night
which
sometimes
happens
if
the
tide
is
favourable
we
let
the
girls
keep
the
lantern
and
we
went
up
with
a
bit
of
candle
dicky
had
saved
and
tried
to
get
comfortable
among
the
millstones
and
machinery
but
it
was
not
easy
and
oswald
for
one
was
not
sorry
when
he
heard
the
voice
of
dora
calling
in
trembling
tones
from
the
floor
below
oswald
dicky
said
the
voice
i
wish
one
of
you
would
come
down
a
sec
oswald
flew
to
the
assistance
of
his
distressed
sister
it
only
that
we
a
little
bit
uncomfortable
she
whispered
i
did
want
to
yell
it
out
because
of
noël
and
i
do
want
to
frighten
them
but
i
ca
help
feeling
that
if
anything
popped
out
of
the
dark
at
us
i
should
die
ca
you
all
come
down
here
the
nets
are
quite
comfortable
and
i
do
wish
you
would
alice
said
she
was
not
frightened
but
suppose
there
were
rats
which
are
said
to
infest
old
buildings
especially
mills
so
we
consented
to
come
down
and
we
told
noël
and
to
come
down
because
it
was
more
comfy
and
it
is
easier
to
settle
yourself
for
the
night
among
than
among
machinery
there
a
rustling
now
and
then
among
the
heap
of
broken
chairs
and
and
baskets
and
spades
and
hoes
and
bits
of
the
spars
of
ships
at
the
far
end
of
our
sleeping
apartment
but
dicky
and
oswald
resolutely
said
it
was
the
wind
or
else
jackdaws
making
their
nests
though
of
course
they
knew
this
is
not
done
at
night
sleeping
in
a
mill
was
not
nearly
the
fun
we
had
thought
it
would
be
somehow
for
one
thing
it
was
horrid
not
having
a
pillow
and
the
were
so
stiff
you
could
not
bunch
them
up
properly
to
make
one
and
unless
you
have
been
born
and
bred
a
red
indian
you
do
not
know
how
to
manage
your
blanket
so
as
to
make
it
keep
out
the
draughts
and
when
we
had
put
out
the
light
oswald
more
than
once
felt
as
though
earwigs
and
spiders
were
walking
on
his
face
in
the
dark
but
when
we
struck
a
match
there
was
nothing
there
and
empty
mills
do
creak
and
rustle
and
move
about
in
a
very
odd
way
oswald
was
not
afraid
but
he
did
think
we
might
as
well
have
slept
in
the
kitchen
because
the
gentleman
could
not
have
wanted
to
use
that
when
he
was
asleep
you
see
we
thought
then
that
he
would
sleep
all
night
like
other
people
we
got
to
sleep
at
last
and
in
the
night
the
girls
edged
up
to
their
bold
brothers
so
that
when
the
morning
sun
shone
in
bars
of
dusty
gold
through
the
chinks
of
the
aged
edifice
and
woke
us
up
we
were
all
lying
in
a
snuggly
heap
like
a
litter
of
puppies
oh
i
so
stiff
said
alice
stretching
i
never
slept
in
my
clothes
before
it
makes
me
feel
as
if
i
had
been
starched
and
ironed
like
a
boy
collar
we
all
felt
pretty
much
the
same
and
our
faces
were
tired
too
and
stiff
which
was
rum
and
the
author
can
not
account
for
it
unless
it
really
was
spiders
that
walked
on
us
i
believe
the
ancient
greeks
considered
them
to
be
venomous
and
perhaps
that
how
their
venom
influences
their
victims
i
think
mills
are
merely
beastly
remarked
when
we
had
woke
him
up
you
ca
wash
yourself
or
brush
your
hair
or
anything
you
are
always
so
jolly
particular
about
your
hair
said
dicky
do
be
so
disagreeable
said
dora
and
dicky
rejoined
disagreeable
yourself
there
is
certainly
something
about
sleeping
in
your
clothes
that
makes
you
feel
not
so
kind
and
polite
as
usual
i
expect
this
is
why
tramps
are
so
fierce
and
knock
people
down
in
lonely
roads
and
kick
them
oswald
knows
he
felt
just
like
kicking
any
one
if
they
had
happened
to
cheek
him
the
least
little
bit
but
by
a
fortunate
accident
nobody
did
the
author
believes
there
is
a
picture
called
hopeless
dawn
we
felt
exactly
like
that
nothing
seemed
the
least
bit
of
good
it
was
a
pitiful
band
with
hands
and
faces
dirtier
than
any
one
would
believe
who
had
not
slept
in
a
mill
or
witnessed
others
who
had
done
so
that
crossed
the
wet
green
grass
between
the
mill
and
the
white
house
i
sha
ever
put
morning
dew
into
my
poetry
again
noël
said
it
is
not
nearly
so
poetical
as
people
make
out
and
it
is
as
cold
as
ice
right
through
your
boots
we
felt
rather
better
when
we
had
had
a
good
splash
in
the
back
kitchen
that
miss
sandal
calls
the
and
alice
made
a
fire
and
boiled
a
kettle
and
we
had
some
tea
and
eggs
then
we
looked
at
the
clock
and
it
was
five
so
we
hastened
to
get
into
another
part
of
the
house
before
beale
came
i
wish
we
tried
to
live
the
higher
life
some
less
beastly
way
said
dicky
as
we
went
along
the
passage
living
the
higher
life
always
hurts
at
the
beginning
alice
said
i
expect
it
like
new
boots
only
when
you
got
used
to
it
you
glad
you
bore
it
at
first
let
listen
at
the
doors
till
we
find
out
where
he
is
sleeping
so
we
listened
at
all
the
bedroom
doors
but
not
a
snore
was
heard
perhaps
he
was
a
burglar
said
and
only
pretended
to
want
lodgings
so
as
to
get
in
and
bone
all
the
valuables
there
are
any
valuables
said
noël
and
this
was
quite
true
for
miss
sandal
had
no
silver
or
jewellery
except
a
brooch
of
pewter
and
the
very
teaspoons
were
of
wood
very
hard
to
keep
clean
and
having
to
be
scraped
perhaps
he
sleeps
without
snoring
said
oswald
some
people
do
not
old
gentlemen
said
noël
think
of
our
indian
uncle
used
to
think
it
was
bears
at
first
perhaps
he
rises
with
the
lark
said
alice
and
is
wondering
why
brekker
is
ready
so
then
we
listened
at
the
doors
and
through
the
keyhole
of
the
parlour
we
heard
a
noise
of
some
one
moving
and
then
in
a
soft
whistle
the
tune
of
the
would
i
were
a
bird
song
so
then
we
went
into
the
to
sit
down
but
when
we
opened
the
door
we
almost
fell
in
a
heap
on
the
matting
and
no
one
had
breath
for
a
word
not
even
for
krikey
which
was
what
we
all
thought
i
have
read
of
people
who
could
not
believe
their
eyes
and
i
have
always
thought
it
such
rot
of
them
but
now
as
the
author
gazed
on
the
scene
he
really
could
not
be
quite
sure
that
he
was
not
in
a
dream
and
that
the
gentleman
and
the
night
in
the
mill
were
dreams
too
pull
back
the
curtains
alice
said
and
we
did
i
wish
i
could
make
the
reader
feel
as
astonished
as
we
did
the
last
time
we
had
seen
the
room
the
walls
had
been
bare
and
white
now
they
were
covered
with
the
most
splendid
drawings
you
can
think
of
all
done
in
coloured
chalk
i
do
mean
mixed
up
like
we
do
with
our
chalks
but
one
picture
was
done
in
green
and
another
in
brown
and
another
in
red
and
so
on
and
the
chalk
must
have
been
of
some
fat
radiant
kind
quite
unknown
to
us
for
some
of
the
lines
were
over
an
inch
thick
how
perfectly
alice
said
he
must
have
sat
up
all
night
to
do
it
he
good
i
expect
he
trying
to
live
the
higher
life
too
just
going
about
doing
secretly
and
spending
his
time
making
other
people
houses
pretty
i
wonder
what
he
have
done
if
the
room
had
had
a
large
pattern
of
brown
roses
on
it
like
beale
said
noël
i
say
at
that
angel
is
it
poetical
it
makes
me
feel
i
must
write
something
about
it
it
a
good
angel
all
drawn
in
grey
that
was
with
very
wide
wings
going
right
across
the
room
and
a
whole
bundle
of
lilies
in
his
arms
then
there
were
seagulls
and
ravens
and
butterflies
and
ballet
girls
with
butterflies
wings
and
a
man
with
artificial
wings
being
fastened
on
and
you
could
see
he
was
just
going
to
jump
off
a
rock
and
there
were
fairies
and
bats
and
and
and
one
glorious
winged
horse
done
in
red
chalk
and
his
wings
went
from
one
side
of
the
room
to
the
other
and
crossed
the
angel
there
were
dozens
and
dozens
of
birds
all
done
in
just
a
few
lines
but
exactly
right
you
could
make
any
mistake
about
what
anything
was
meant
for
and
all
the
things
whatever
they
were
had
wings
to
them
how
oswald
wishes
that
those
pictures
had
been
done
in
his
house
while
we
stood
gazing
the
door
of
the
other
room
opened
and
the
gentleman
stood
before
us
more
covered
with
chalks
than
i
should
have
thought
he
could
have
got
even
with
all
those
drawings
and
he
had
a
thing
made
of
wire
and
paper
in
his
hand
and
he
said
would
you
like
to
fly
yes
said
every
one
well
then
he
said
i
got
a
nice
little
here
fit
it
on
to
one
of
you
and
then
you
jump
out
of
the
attic
window
you
do
know
what
it
like
to
fly
we
said
we
would
rather
not
but
i
insist
said
the
gentleman
i
have
your
real
interest
at
heart
my
children
i
ca
allow
you
in
your
ignorance
to
reject
the
chance
of
a
lifetime
we
still
said
no
thank
you
and
we
began
to
feel
very
uncomfy
for
the
gentleman
eyes
were
now
rolling
wildly
then
i
you
he
said
catching
hold
of
oswald
illustration
then
i
you
he
said
catching
hold
of
oswald
you
jolly
well
wo
cried
dicky
catching
hold
of
the
arm
of
the
gentleman
then
dora
said
very
primly
and
speaking
rather
slowly
and
she
was
very
pale
i
think
it
would
be
lovely
to
fly
will
you
just
show
me
how
the
looks
when
it
is
unfolded
the
gentleman
dropped
oswald
and
dora
made
go
go
with
her
lips
without
speaking
while
he
began
to
unfold
the
we
others
went
oswald
lingering
last
and
then
in
an
instant
dora
had
nipped
out
of
the
room
and
banged
the
door
and
locked
it
to
the
mill
she
cried
and
we
ran
like
mad
and
got
in
and
barred
the
big
door
and
went
up
to
the
first
floor
and
looked
out
of
the
big
window
to
warn
off
beale
and
we
thumped
dora
on
the
back
and
dicky
called
her
a
sherlock
holmes
and
noël
said
she
was
a
heroine
it
was
anything
dora
said
just
before
she
began
to
cry
only
i
remember
reading
that
you
must
pretend
to
humour
them
and
then
get
away
for
of
course
i
saw
at
once
he
was
a
lunatic
oh
how
awful
it
might
have
been
he
could
have
made
us
all
jump
out
of
the
attic
window
and
there
would
have
been
no
one
left
to
tell
father
oh
oh
and
then
the
crying
began
but
we
were
proud
of
dora
and
i
am
sorry
we
make
fun
of
her
sometimes
but
it
is
difficult
not
to
we
decided
to
signal
the
first
person
that
passed
and
we
got
alice
to
take
off
her
red
flannel
petticoat
for
a
signal
the
first
people
who
came
were
two
men
in
a
we
waved
the
signalising
petticoat
and
they
pulled
up
and
one
got
out
and
came
up
to
the
mill
we
explained
about
the
lunatic
and
the
wanting
us
to
jump
out
of
the
windows
right
oh
cried
the
man
to
the
one
still
in
the
cart
got
him
and
the
other
hitched
the
horse
to
the
gate
and
came
over
and
the
other
went
to
the
house
come
along
down
young
ladies
and
gentlemen
said
the
second
man
when
he
had
been
told
he
as
gentle
as
a
lamb
he
does
not
think
it
hurts
to
jump
out
of
windows
he
thinks
it
really
is
flying
he
be
like
an
angel
when
he
sees
the
doctor
we
asked
if
he
had
been
mad
before
because
we
had
thought
he
might
have
suddenly
gone
so
certainly
he
has
replied
the
man
he
has
never
been
so
to
say
himself
since
tumbling
out
of
a
he
went
up
in
with
a
friend
he
was
an
artist
previous
to
that
an
excellent
one
i
believe
but
now
he
only
draws
objects
with
wings
and
now
and
then
he
wants
to
make
people
fly
perfect
strangers
sometimes
like
yourselves
yes
miss
i
am
his
attendant
and
his
pictures
often
amuse
me
by
the
together
poor
gentleman
how
did
he
get
away
alice
asked
well
miss
the
poor
gentleman
brother
got
hurt
and
sidney
that
him
inside
seemed
wonderfully
put
out
and
hung
over
the
body
in
a
way
pitiful
to
see
but
really
he
was
extracting
the
cash
from
the
sufferer
pockets
then
while
all
of
us
were
occupied
with
eustace
sidney
just
packs
his
portmanteau
and
out
he
goes
by
the
back
door
when
we
missed
him
we
sent
for
baker
but
by
the
time
he
came
it
was
too
late
to
get
here
baker
said
at
once
he
revert
to
his
boyhood
home
and
the
doctor
has
proved
correct
we
had
all
come
out
of
the
mill
and
with
this
polite
person
we
went
to
the
gate
and
saw
the
lunatic
get
into
the
carriage
very
gentle
and
gay
but
doctor
oswald
said
he
did
say
he
give
nine
pounds
a
week
for
the
rooms
ought
he
to
pay
you
might
have
known
he
was
mad
to
say
that
said
the
doctor
no
why
should
he
when
it
his
own
sister
house
gee
up
and
he
left
us
it
was
sad
to
find
the
gentleman
was
not
a
higher
life
after
all
but
only
mad
and
i
was
more
sorry
than
ever
for
poor
miss
sandal
as
oswald
pointed
out
to
the
girls
they
are
much
more
blessed
in
their
brothers
than
miss
sandal
is
and
they
ought
to
be
more
grateful
than
they
are
smuggler
the
days
went
on
and
miss
sandal
did
not
return
we
went
on
being
very
sorry
about
miss
sandal
being
so
poor
and
it
was
not
our
fault
that
when
we
tried
to
let
the
house
in
lodgings
the
first
lodger
proved
to
be
a
lunatic
of
the
deepest
dye
miss
sandal
must
have
been
a
fairly
decent
sort
because
she
seems
not
to
have
written
to
father
about
it
at
any
rate
he
did
give
it
us
in
any
of
our
letters
about
our
good
intentions
and
their
ending
in
a
maniac
oswald
does
not
like
giving
up
a
thing
just
because
it
has
once
been
muffed
the
muffage
of
a
plan
is
a
thing
that
often
happens
at
first
to
heroes
like
bruce
and
the
spider
and
other
great
characters
beside
always
say
if
at
first
you
do
succeed
try
try
try
again
and
if
this
is
the
rule
for
euclid
and
and
all
the
things
you
would
rather
not
do
think
how
much
more
it
must
be
the
rule
when
what
you
are
after
is
your
own
idea
and
not
just
the
rotten
notion
of
that
beast
euclid
or
the
unknown
but
equally
unnecessary
author
who
composed
the
multiplication
table
so
we
often
talked
about
what
we
could
do
to
make
miss
sandal
rich
it
gave
us
something
to
jaw
about
when
we
happened
to
want
to
sit
down
for
a
bit
in
between
all
the
glorious
wet
sandy
games
that
happen
by
the
sea
of
course
if
we
wanted
real
improving
conversation
we
used
to
go
up
to
the
and
talk
to
the
coastguards
i
do
think
coastguards
are
they
are
just
the
same
as
sailors
having
been
so
in
their
youth
and
you
can
get
at
them
to
talk
to
which
is
not
the
case
with
sailors
who
are
at
sea
or
even
in
harbours
on
ships
even
if
you
had
the
luck
to
get
on
to
a
you
would
very
likely
not
be
able
to
climb
to
the
to
talk
to
the
man
there
though
in
books
the
young
hero
always
seems
able
to
climb
to
the
the
moment
he
is
told
to
the
coastguards
told
us
tales
of
southern
ports
and
of
shipwrecks
and
officers
they
had
cottoned
to
and
messmates
that
they
but
when
we
asked
them
about
smuggling
they
said
there
was
any
to
speak
of
nowadays
i
expect
they
think
they
ought
to
talk
about
such
dark
crimes
before
innocent
kids
like
us
said
dicky
afterwards
and
he
grinned
as
he
said
it
yes
said
alice
they
do
know
how
much
we
know
about
smugglers
and
bandits
and
highwaymen
and
burglars
and
coiners
and
she
sighed
and
we
all
felt
sad
to
think
that
we
had
not
now
any
chance
to
play
at
being
these
things
we
might
play
smugglers
said
oswald
but
he
did
not
speak
hopefully
the
worst
of
growing
up
is
that
you
seem
to
want
more
and
more
to
have
a
bit
of
the
real
thing
in
your
games
oswald
could
not
now
be
content
to
play
at
bandits
and
just
capture
albert
next
door
as
once
in
happier
days
he
was
pleased
and
proud
to
do
it
was
not
a
coastguard
that
told
us
about
the
smugglers
it
was
a
very
old
man
that
we
met
two
or
three
miles
along
the
beach
he
was
leaning
against
a
boat
that
was
wrong
way
up
on
the
shingle
and
smoking
the
strongest
tobacco
oswald
young
nose
has
ever
met
i
think
it
must
have
been
black
jack
we
said
how
do
you
do
and
alice
said
do
you
mind
if
we
sit
down
near
you
not
me
replied
the
aged
seafarer
we
could
see
directly
that
he
was
this
by
his
jersey
and
his
the
girls
sat
down
on
the
beach
but
we
boys
leaned
against
the
boat
like
the
seafaring
one
we
hoped
he
would
join
in
conversation
but
at
first
he
seemed
too
proud
and
there
was
something
dignified
about
him
bearded
and
like
a
viking
that
made
it
hard
for
us
to
begin
at
last
he
took
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
and
said
here
a
precious
quakers
meeting
you
did
set
down
here
just
for
to
look
at
me
i
sure
you
look
very
nice
dora
said
same
to
you
miss
i
sure
was
the
polite
reply
we
want
to
talk
to
you
awfully
said
alice
if
you
do
mind
talk
away
said
he
and
then
as
so
often
happens
no
one
could
think
of
anything
to
say
suddenly
noël
said
think
you
look
nice
too
but
i
think
you
look
as
though
you
had
a
secret
history
have
you
not
me
replied
the
stranger
i
ai
got
no
history
nor
neither
they
did
give
us
that
much
schooling
when
i
was
a
lad
oh
replied
noël
but
what
i
really
meant
was
were
you
ever
a
pirate
or
anything
never
in
all
my
born
replied
the
stranger
now
thoroughly
roused
i
scorn
the
haction
i
was
in
the
navy
i
was
till
i
lost
the
sight
of
my
eye
looking
too
close
at
gunpowder
pirates
is
snakes
and
they
ought
to
be
killed
as
such
we
felt
rather
sorry
for
though
of
course
it
is
very
wrong
to
be
a
pirate
it
is
very
interesting
too
things
are
often
like
this
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
it
is
so
hard
to
be
truly
good
dora
was
the
only
one
who
was
pleased
she
said
yes
pirates
very
wrong
and
so
are
highwaymen
and
smugglers
i
do
know
about
highwaymen
the
old
man
replied
they
went
out
afore
my
time
worse
luck
but
my
father
by
the
side
he
see
one
hanged
once
a
fine
upstanding
fellow
he
was
and
made
a
speech
while
they
was
of
the
rope
all
the
women
was
snivelling
and
sniffing
and
throwing
bokays
at
him
did
any
of
the
bouquets
reach
him
asked
the
interested
alice
not
likely
said
the
old
man
women
ca
never
shy
straight
but
i
should
wonder
but
what
them
posies
heartened
the
chap
up
a
bit
an
afterwards
they
was
all
to
get
a
bit
of
the
rope
he
was
hung
with
for
luck
do
tell
us
some
more
about
him
said
all
of
us
but
dora
i
do
know
no
more
about
him
he
was
just
hung
that
all
they
was
precious
fond
o
hangin
in
them
old
times
did
you
ever
know
a
smuggler
asked
to
speak
to
i
mean
ah
that
tellings
said
the
old
man
and
he
winked
at
us
all
so
then
we
instantly
knew
that
the
coastguards
had
been
mistaken
when
they
said
there
were
no
more
smugglers
now
and
that
this
brave
old
man
would
not
betray
his
comrades
even
to
friendly
strangers
like
us
but
of
course
he
could
not
know
exactly
how
friendly
we
were
so
we
told
him
oswald
said
we
smugglers
we
would
even
tell
a
word
about
it
if
you
would
only
tell
us
there
used
to
be
lots
of
smuggling
on
these
here
coasts
when
my
father
was
a
boy
he
said
my
own
father
cousin
his
father
took
to
the
smuggling
and
he
was
a
doin
so
well
at
it
that
what
does
he
do
but
goes
and
gets
married
and
the
preventives
they
goes
and
nabs
him
on
his
and
walks
him
straight
off
from
the
church
door
and
claps
him
in
dover
jail
oh
his
poor
wife
said
alice
whatever
did
she
do
did
do
nothing
said
the
old
man
it
a
woman
place
not
to
do
nothing
till
she
told
to
he
done
so
well
at
the
smuggling
he
saved
enough
by
his
honest
toil
to
take
a
little
public
so
she
sets
there
awaitin
and
attendin
to
customers
for
well
she
knowed
him
as
he
was
the
chap
to
let
a
bit
of
a
jail
stand
in
the
way
of
his
station
in
life
well
it
was
three
weeks
to
a
day
after
the
wedding
there
comes
a
dusty
chap
to
the
of
bells
door
that
was
the
sign
over
the
public
you
understand
we
said
we
did
and
breathlessly
added
go
on
a
dusty
chap
he
was
got
a
beard
and
a
patch
over
one
eye
and
he
come
of
a
afternoon
when
there
was
no
one
about
the
place
but
her
missis
says
he
a
room
for
a
quiet
chap
do
take
in
no
says
she
be
bothered
with
be
bothered
with
if
i
not
mistaken
says
he
if
i
will
says
she
if
you
wo
says
he
and
with
that
he
ups
with
his
hand
and
off
comes
the
black
patch
and
he
pulls
off
the
beard
and
gives
her
a
kiss
and
a
smack
on
the
shoulder
she
always
said
she
nearly
died
when
she
see
it
was
her
bridegroom
under
the
beard
so
she
took
her
own
man
in
as
a
lodger
and
he
went
to
work
up
at
upton
farm
with
his
beard
on
and
of
nights
he
kept
up
the
smuggling
business
and
for
a
year
or
more
no
one
knowd
as
it
was
him
but
they
got
him
at
last
what
became
of
him
we
all
asked
it
he
dead
said
the
old
man
but
lord
love
you
so
everybody
as
lived
in
them
old
ancient
days
all
dead
preventives
too
and
smugglers
and
gentry
all
gone
under
the
daisies
we
felt
quite
sad
oswald
hastily
asked
if
there
was
any
smuggling
now
not
hereabouts
the
old
man
answered
rather
quickly
for
him
you
go
for
to
think
it
but
i
did
know
a
young
chap
quite
young
he
is
with
blue
eyes
up
sunderland
way
it
was
he
got
a
goodish
bit
baccy
and
stuff
done
up
in
a
ole
shirt
and
as
he
was
up
off
of
the
beach
a
coastguard
jumps
out
at
him
and
he
says
to
himself
this
time
says
he
but
out
loud
he
says
jack
that
you
i
thought
you
was
a
tramp
says
he
you
got
in
that
bundle
says
the
coastguard
washing
says
he
a
couple
pairs
of
old
boots
then
the
coastguard
he
says
i
give
you
a
lift
with
it
thinking
in
himself
the
other
chap
would
part
if
it
was
anything
it
ought
to
be
but
that
young
chap
was
too
sharp
he
says
to
himself
i
do
he
nail
me
and
if
i
do
well
there
just
a
chance
so
he
hands
over
the
bundle
and
the
coastguard
he
thinks
it
must
be
all
right
and
he
carries
it
all
the
way
up
to
his
mother
for
him
feeling
sorry
for
the
mean
suspicions
he
had
about
the
poor
old
chap
but
that
did
happen
near
here
no
no
i
think
dora
was
going
to
say
chap
but
i
thought
he
was
young
with
blue
eyes
but
just
at
that
minute
a
coastguard
came
along
and
ordered
us
quite
harshly
not
to
lean
on
the
boat
he
was
quite
disagreeable
about
it
how
different
from
our
own
coastguards
he
was
from
a
different
station
to
theirs
the
old
man
got
off
very
slowly
and
all
the
time
he
was
arranging
his
long
legs
so
as
to
stand
on
them
the
coastguard
went
on
being
disagreeable
as
hard
as
he
could
in
a
loud
voice
illustration
a
coastguard
ordered
us
quite
harshly
not
to
lean
on
the
boat
when
our
old
man
had
told
the
coastguard
that
no
one
ever
lost
anything
by
keeping
a
civil
tongue
in
his
head
we
all
went
away
feeling
very
angry
alice
took
the
old
man
hand
as
we
went
back
to
the
village
and
asked
him
why
the
coastguard
was
so
horrid
they
gets
notions
into
their
heads
replied
the
old
man
the
most
innocentest
people
they
comes
to
think
things
about
it
along
of
there
being
no
smuggling
in
these
ere
parts
now
the
coastguards
ai
got
nothing
to
do
except
think
things
about
honest
people
we
parted
from
the
old
man
very
warmly
all
shaking
hands
he
lives
at
a
cottage
not
quite
in
the
village
and
keeps
pigs
we
did
not
say
goodbye
till
we
had
seen
all
the
pigs
i
daresay
we
should
not
have
gone
on
disliking
that
disagreeable
coastguard
so
much
if
he
had
not
come
along
one
day
when
we
were
talking
to
our
own
coastguards
and
asked
why
they
allowed
a
pack
of
young
shavers
in
the
we
went
away
in
silent
dignity
but
we
did
not
forget
and
when
we
were
in
bed
that
night
oswald
said
do
you
think
it
would
be
a
good
thing
if
the
coastguards
had
something
to
do
dicky
yawned
and
said
he
did
know
i
should
like
to
be
a
smuggler
said
oswald
oh
yes
go
to
sleep
if
you
like
but
i
got
an
idea
and
if
you
rather
be
out
of
it
have
alice
instead
fire
away
said
dicky
now
full
of
attention
and
leaning
on
his
elbow
well
then
said
oswald
i
think
we
be
smugglers
we
played
all
those
things
so
jolly
often
said
dicky
but
i
do
mean
play
said
oswald
i
mean
the
real
thing
of
course
we
should
have
to
begin
in
quite
a
small
way
but
we
should
get
on
in
time
and
we
might
make
quite
a
lot
for
poor
miss
sandal
things
that
you
smuggle
are
expensive
said
dicky
well
we
got
the
chink
the
indian
uncle
sent
us
on
saturday
certain
we
could
do
it
we
get
some
one
to
take
us
out
at
night
in
one
of
the
just
tear
across
to
france
and
buy
a
keg
or
a
bale
or
something
and
rush
back
yes
and
get
nabbed
and
put
in
prison
not
me
said
dicky
besides
who
take
us
that
old
viking
man
would
said
oswald
but
of
course
if
you
funk
it
i
do
funk
anything
said
dicky
bar
making
an
ape
of
myself
keep
your
hair
on
oswald
look
here
suppose
we
get
a
keg
with
nothing
in
it
or
just
water
we
should
have
all
the
fun
and
if
we
collared
we
should
have
the
laugh
of
that
coastguard
brute
oswald
agreed
but
he
made
it
a
condition
that
we
should
call
it
the
keg
of
brandy
whatever
was
in
it
and
dicky
consented
smuggling
is
a
manly
sport
and
girls
are
not
fitted
for
it
by
nature
at
least
dora
is
not
and
if
we
had
told
alice
she
would
have
insisted
on
dressing
as
a
boy
and
going
too
and
we
knew
father
would
not
like
this
and
we
thought
noël
and
were
too
young
to
be
smugglers
with
any
hope
of
success
so
dicky
and
i
kept
the
idea
to
ourselves
we
went
to
see
the
viking
man
the
next
day
it
took
us
some
time
to
make
him
understand
what
we
wanted
but
when
he
did
understand
he
slapped
his
leg
many
times
and
very
hard
and
declared
that
we
were
chips
of
the
old
block
but
i
ca
go
for
to
let
you
he
said
if
you
was
nailed
it
the
stone
jug
bless
your
hearts
so
then
we
explained
about
the
keg
really
having
only
water
in
and
he
slapped
his
leg
again
harder
than
ever
so
that
it
would
really
have
been
painful
to
any
but
the
hardened
leg
of
an
old
but
the
water
made
his
refusals
weaker
and
at
last
he
said
well
see
here
benenden
him
as
owns
the
he
often
took
out
a
youngster
or
two
for
the
night
fishing
when
their
pa
and
had
no
objection
you
write
your
pa
and
ask
if
you
may
go
for
the
night
fishing
or
you
get
charteris
to
write
he
knows
all
right
and
often
done
by
visitors
kids
if
boys
and
if
your
pa
says
yes
i
make
it
all
right
with
benenden
but
mind
it
just
a
night
fishing
no
need
to
name
no
kegs
that
just
betwixt
ourselves
so
we
did
exactly
as
he
said
charteris
is
the
clergyman
he
was
quite
nice
about
it
and
wrote
for
us
and
father
said
yes
but
be
very
careful
and
do
take
the
girls
or
the
little
ones
we
showed
the
girls
the
letter
and
that
removed
the
trifling
that
had
grown
up
through
dick
and
me
having
so
much
secret
talk
about
kegs
and
not
telling
the
others
what
was
up
of
course
we
never
breathed
a
word
about
kegs
in
public
and
only
to
each
other
in
bated
breaths
what
father
said
about
not
taking
the
girls
or
the
little
ones
of
course
settled
any
wild
ideas
alice
might
have
had
of
going
as
a
the
old
viking
man
now
completely
interested
in
our
scheme
laid
all
the
plans
in
the
way
you
can
think
he
chose
a
very
dark
night
fortunately
there
was
one
just
coming
on
he
chose
the
right
time
of
the
tide
for
starting
and
just
in
the
greyness
of
the
evening
when
the
sun
is
gone
down
and
the
sea
somehow
looks
wetter
than
at
any
other
time
we
put
on
our
thick
undershirts
and
then
our
thickest
suits
and
football
jerseys
over
everything
because
we
had
been
told
it
would
be
very
cold
then
we
said
goodbye
to
our
sisters
and
the
little
ones
and
it
was
exactly
like
a
picture
of
the
tar
farewell
because
we
had
bundles
with
things
to
eat
tied
up
in
blue
checked
handkerchiefs
and
we
said
goodbye
to
them
at
the
gate
and
they
would
kiss
us
dora
said
goodbye
i
you
be
drowned
i
hope
you
enjoy
yourselves
i
sure
alice
said
i
do
think
it
perfectly
beastly
you
might
just
as
well
have
asked
for
me
to
go
with
you
or
you
might
let
us
come
and
see
you
start
men
must
work
and
women
must
weep
replied
oswald
with
grim
sadness
and
the
viking
said
he
would
have
us
at
all
unless
we
could
get
on
board
in
a
concealed
manner
like
stowaways
he
said
a
lot
of
others
would
want
to
go
too
if
they
saw
us
we
made
our
way
to
the
beach
and
we
tried
to
conceal
ourselves
as
much
as
possible
but
several
people
did
see
us
when
we
got
to
the
boat
we
found
she
was
manned
by
our
viking
and
benenden
and
a
boy
with
red
hair
and
they
were
running
her
down
to
the
beach
on
rollers
of
course
dicky
and
i
lent
a
hand
shoving
at
the
stern
of
the
boat
when
the
men
said
yo
ho
heave
ho
my
merry
boys
all
it
was
exactly
that
that
they
said
but
it
meant
the
same
thing
and
we
heaved
like
anything
it
was
a
proud
moment
when
her
nose
touched
the
water
and
prouder
still
when
only
a
small
part
of
her
stern
remained
on
the
beach
and
benenden
remarked
all
aboard
the
red
boy
gave
a
leg
up
to
dicky
and
me
and
clambered
up
himself
then
the
two
men
gave
the
last
shoves
to
the
boat
already
cradled
almost
entirely
on
the
bosom
of
the
deep
and
as
the
very
end
of
the
keel
grated
off
the
pebbles
into
the
water
they
leaped
for
the
gunwale
and
hung
on
it
with
their
high
waving
in
the
evening
air
by
the
time
they
had
brought
their
legs
on
board
and
coiled
a
rope
or
two
we
chanced
to
look
back
and
already
the
beach
seemed
quite
a
long
way
off
we
were
really
afloat
our
smuggling
expedition
was
no
longer
a
dream
but
a
real
realness
oswald
felt
almost
too
excited
at
first
to
be
able
to
enjoy
himself
i
hope
you
will
understand
this
and
not
think
the
author
is
trying
to
express
by
roundabout
means
that
the
sea
did
not
agree
with
oswald
this
is
not
the
case
he
was
perfectly
well
the
whole
time
it
was
dicky
who
was
not
but
he
said
it
was
the
smell
of
the
cabin
and
not
the
sea
and
i
am
sure
he
thought
what
he
said
was
true
in
fact
that
cabin
was
a
bit
stiff
altogether
and
was
almost
the
means
of
upsetting
even
oswald
it
was
about
six
feet
square
with
bunks
and
an
oil
stove
and
heaps
of
old
coats
and
tarpaulins
and
and
things
and
it
smelt
of
tar
and
fish
and
and
machinery
oil
and
of
rooms
where
no
one
ever
opens
the
window
oswald
just
put
his
nose
in
and
that
was
all
he
had
to
go
down
later
when
some
fish
was
cooked
and
eaten
but
by
that
time
he
had
got
what
they
call
your
but
oswald
felt
more
as
if
he
had
got
a
rather
as
if
he
had
got
rid
of
a
that
was
too
heavy
and
too
tight
i
will
not
weary
the
reader
by
telling
about
how
the
nets
are
paid
out
and
dragged
in
or
about
the
tumbling
shining
heaps
of
fish
that
come
up
all
alive
over
the
side
of
the
boat
and
it
tips
up
with
their
weight
till
you
think
it
is
going
over
it
was
a
very
good
catch
that
night
and
oswald
is
glad
he
saw
it
for
it
was
very
glorious
dicky
was
asleep
in
the
cabin
at
the
time
and
missed
it
it
was
deemed
best
not
to
rouse
him
to
fresh
sufferings
it
was
getting
latish
and
oswald
though
thrilled
in
every
marrow
was
getting
rather
sleepy
when
old
benenden
said
there
she
is
oswald
could
see
nothing
at
first
but
presently
he
saw
a
dark
form
on
the
smooth
sea
it
turned
out
to
be
another
boat
she
crept
quietly
up
till
she
was
alongside
ours
and
then
a
keg
was
hastily
hoisted
from
her
to
us
a
few
words
in
low
voices
were
exchanged
oswald
only
heard
sure
you
ai
give
us
the
wrong
un
and
several
people
laughed
hoarsely
on
first
going
on
board
oswald
and
dicky
had
mentioned
kegs
and
had
been
ordered
to
stow
that
so
that
oswald
had
begun
to
fear
that
after
all
it
only
a
night
fishing
and
that
his
glorious
idea
had
been
abandoned
but
now
he
saw
the
keg
his
trembling
heart
was
reassured
it
got
colder
and
colder
dicky
in
the
cabin
was
covered
with
several
coats
richly
scented
with
fish
and
oswald
was
glad
to
accept
an
oilskin
and
and
to
sit
down
on
some
spare
nets
until
you
are
out
on
the
sea
at
night
you
can
never
have
any
idea
how
big
the
world
really
is
the
sky
looks
higher
up
and
the
stars
look
further
off
and
even
if
you
know
it
is
only
the
english
channel
yet
it
is
just
as
good
for
feeling
small
on
as
the
most
trackless
atlantic
or
pacific
even
the
fish
help
to
show
the
largeness
of
the
world
because
you
think
of
the
deep
deepness
of
the
dark
sea
they
come
up
out
of
in
such
rich
profusion
the
hold
was
full
of
fish
after
the
second
haul
oswald
sat
leaning
against
the
precious
keg
and
perhaps
the
bigness
and
quietness
of
everything
had
really
rendered
him
unconscious
but
he
did
not
know
he
was
asleep
until
the
viking
man
woke
him
up
by
kindly
shaking
him
and
saying
here
look
alive
was
ye
thinking
to
beach
her
with
that
there
precious
keg
of
yours
all
above
board
and
crying
out
to
be
broached
so
then
oswald
roused
himself
and
the
keg
was
rolled
on
to
the
fish
where
they
lay
filling
the
hold
and
armfuls
of
fish
thrown
over
it
is
it
only
water
asked
oswald
there
an
awfully
odd
smell
and
indeed
in
spite
of
the
many
different
smells
that
are
natural
to
a
oswald
began
to
notice
a
strong
scent
of
railway
in
course
it
only
water
said
the
viking
what
else
would
it
be
likely
to
be
and
oswald
thinks
he
winked
in
the
dark
perhaps
oswald
fell
asleep
again
after
this
it
was
either
that
or
deep
thought
any
way
he
was
aroused
from
it
by
a
bump
and
a
soft
grating
sound
and
he
thought
at
first
the
boat
was
being
wrecked
on
a
coral
reef
or
something
but
almost
directly
he
knew
that
the
boat
had
merely
come
ashore
in
the
proper
manner
so
he
jumped
up
you
can
not
push
a
boat
out
of
the
water
like
you
push
it
in
it
has
to
be
hauled
up
by
a
capstan
if
you
do
know
what
that
is
the
author
is
unable
to
explain
but
there
is
a
picture
of
one
when
the
boat
was
hauled
up
we
got
out
and
it
was
very
odd
to
stretch
your
legs
on
land
again
it
felt
shakier
than
being
on
sea
the
boy
went
off
to
get
a
cart
to
take
the
shining
fish
to
market
and
oswald
decided
to
face
the
smells
of
that
cabin
and
wake
dicky
dicky
was
not
grateful
to
oswald
for
his
thoughtful
kindness
in
letting
him
sleep
through
the
perils
of
the
deep
and
his
own
uncomfortableness
he
said
i
do
think
you
might
have
waked
a
chap
i
simply
been
out
of
everything
oswald
did
not
answer
back
his
is
a
proud
and
nature
he
just
said
well
hurry
up
now
and
see
them
cart
the
fish
away
so
we
hurried
up
and
as
oswald
came
out
of
the
cabin
he
heard
strange
voices
and
his
heart
leaped
up
like
the
persons
who
behold
a
rainbow
in
the
sky
for
one
of
the
voices
was
the
voice
of
that
inferior
and
unsailorlike
coastguard
from
longbeach
who
had
gone
out
of
his
way
to
be
disagreeable
to
oswald
and
his
brothers
and
sisters
on
at
least
two
occasions
and
now
oswald
felt
almost
sure
that
his
disagreeablenesses
though
not
exactly
curses
were
coming
home
to
roost
just
as
though
they
had
been
you
missing
your
beauty
sleep
stokes
we
heard
our
viking
remark
i
not
missing
anything
else
though
replied
the
coastguard
like
half
a
dozen
mackerel
for
your
breakfast
inquired
benenden
in
kindly
accents
i
no
stomach
for
fish
thank
you
all
the
same
replied
stokes
coldly
he
walked
up
and
down
on
the
beach
clapping
his
arms
to
keep
himself
warm
going
to
see
us
unload
her
asked
benenden
if
it
all
the
same
to
you
answered
the
disagreeable
coastguard
he
had
to
wait
a
long
time
for
the
cart
did
not
come
and
did
not
come
and
kept
on
not
coming
for
ages
and
ages
when
it
did
the
men
unloaded
the
boat
carrying
the
fish
by
basketfuls
to
the
cart
every
one
played
up
jolly
well
they
took
the
fish
from
the
side
of
the
hold
where
the
keg
was
till
there
was
quite
a
deep
hole
there
and
the
other
side
where
the
keg
really
was
looked
like
a
mountain
in
comparison
this
could
be
plainly
seen
by
the
detested
coastguard
and
by
three
of
his
companions
who
had
now
joined
him
it
was
beginning
to
be
light
not
daylight
but
a
sort
of
that
you
could
hardly
believe
was
the
beginning
of
sunshine
and
the
sky
being
blue
again
instead
of
black
the
hated
coastguard
got
impatient
he
said
you
best
own
up
it
be
the
better
for
you
it
bound
to
come
out
along
of
the
fish
i
know
it
there
we
had
private
information
up
at
the
station
the
game
up
this
time
so
do
you
make
no
mistake
benenden
and
the
viking
and
the
boy
looked
at
each
other
an
what
might
your
precious
private
information
have
been
about
asked
benenden
brandy
replied
the
coastguard
stokes
and
he
went
and
got
on
to
the
gunwale
and
what
more
i
can
smell
it
from
here
oswald
and
dicky
drew
near
and
the
smell
was
stronger
than
ever
and
a
brown
corner
of
the
keg
was
peeping
out
there
you
are
cried
the
loathed
one
let
have
that
gentleman
out
if
you
please
and
then
you
all
just
come
alonger
me
remarking
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
that
he
supposed
it
was
all
up
our
viking
scattered
the
fish
that
hid
the
barrel
and
hoisted
it
out
from
its
scaly
bed
that
about
the
size
of
it
said
the
coastguard
we
did
not
like
where
the
rest
that
all
said
benenden
we
poor
men
and
we
has
to
act
according
to
our
means
we
see
the
boat
clear
to
her
last
timber
if
you
no
objections
said
the
detestable
one
i
could
see
that
our
gallant
crew
were
prepared
to
go
through
with
the
business
more
and
more
of
the
coastguards
were
collecting
and
i
understood
that
what
the
crew
wanted
was
to
go
up
to
the
coastguard
station
with
that
keg
of
pretending
brandy
and
involve
the
whole
of
the
coastguards
of
longbeach
in
one
complete
and
perfect
sell
but
dicky
was
sick
of
the
entire
business
he
really
has
not
the
proper
soul
for
adventures
and
what
soul
he
has
had
been
damped
by
what
he
had
gone
through
so
he
said
look
here
there
nothing
in
that
keg
but
water
oswald
could
have
kicked
him
though
he
is
his
brother
huh
replied
the
unloved
one
think
i
have
got
a
nose
why
it
oozing
out
of
the
bunghole
now
as
strong
as
samson
open
it
and
see
said
dicky
disregarding
oswald
whispered
instructions
to
him
to
shut
up
it
water
what
do
you
suppose
i
suppose
you
want
to
get
water
from
the
other
side
for
you
young
duffer
replied
the
brutal
official
there
plenty
water
and
to
spare
this
side
it
it
water
replied
dicky
madly
it
ours
my
brother
and
mine
we
asked
these
sailors
to
get
it
for
us
sailors
indeed
said
the
hateful
coastguard
you
come
along
with
me
and
our
viking
said
he
was
something
or
othered
but
benenden
whispered
to
him
in
a
low
voice
that
it
was
all
right
time
was
up
no
one
heard
this
but
me
and
the
viking
i
want
to
go
home
said
dicky
i
do
want
to
come
along
with
you
what
did
you
want
water
for
was
asked
to
try
it
to
stand
you
a
drink
next
time
you
ordered
us
off
your
beastly
boat
said
dicky
and
oswald
rejoiced
to
hear
the
roar
of
laughter
that
responded
to
this
fortunate
piece
of
cheek
i
suppose
dicky
face
was
so
like
stowaways
in
books
that
they
to
believe
him
oswald
told
him
so
afterwards
and
dicky
hit
out
any
way
the
keg
was
broached
and
sure
enough
it
was
water
and
at
that
as
the
unamiable
one
said
when
he
had
tasted
it
out
of
a
tin
cup
for
nothing
else
would
convince
him
but
i
smell
brandy
still
he
said
wiping
his
mouth
after
the
our
viking
slowly
drew
a
flat
labelled
bottle
out
of
the
front
of
his
jersey
from
the
ship
he
said
gently
i
may
have
spilt
a
drop
or
two
here
or
there
over
the
keg
my
hand
not
being
very
steady
as
is
well
known
owing
to
spells
of
marsh
fever
as
comes
over
me
every
six
weeks
to
the
day
the
coastguard
that
we
never
could
bear
said
marsh
fever
be
something
or
othered
and
his
comrades
said
the
same
but
they
all
blamed
and
we
were
glad
we
went
home
sleepy
but
rejoicing
the
whole
thing
was
as
complete
a
sell
as
ever
i
wish
to
see
illustration
sure
enough
it
was
as
the
unamiable
one
said
when
he
had
tasted
it
of
course
we
told
our
own
dear
and
respected
lymchurch
coastguards
and
i
think
they
may
be
trusted
not
to
let
it
down
on
the
longbeach
coastguards
for
many
a
good
day
if
their
memories
get
bad
i
think
there
will
always
be
plenty
of
people
along
that
coast
to
remind
them
so
all
right
when
we
had
told
the
girls
all
and
borne
their
reproaches
for
not
telling
them
before
we
decided
to
give
the
viking
five
bob
for
the
game
way
he
had
played
up
so
we
did
he
would
not
take
it
at
first
but
when
we
said
do
you
might
buy
a
pig
with
it
and
call
it
stokes
after
that
coastguard
he
could
no
longer
resist
and
accepted
our
friendly
gift
we
talked
with
him
for
a
bit
and
when
we
were
going
we
thanked
him
for
being
so
jolly
and
helping
us
to
plant
out
the
repulsive
coastguard
so
thoroughly
then
he
said
do
mention
it
did
you
tell
your
little
gells
what
you
was
up
to
no
said
oswald
not
till
afterwards
then
you
hold
your
tongues
well
since
you
acted
so
handsome
about
that
there
pig
what
to
be
named
for
stokes
i
do
mind
if
i
tells
you
something
only
mum
the
word
we
said
we
were
quite
sure
it
was
well
then
said
he
leaning
over
the
wall
and
rubbing
the
spotted
pig
back
with
his
stick
it
an
ill
wind
that
blows
no
good
to
nobody
you
see
that
night
there
was
a
little
bird
went
whispered
to
up
at
longbeach
about
our
little
bit
of
a
keg
so
when
we
landed
they
was
there
of
course
said
oswald
well
if
they
was
there
they
could
be
somewheres
else
could
they
we
owned
they
could
not
i
should
wonder
he
went
on
but
what
a
bit
of
a
cargo
was
run
that
night
further
up
the
beach
something
as
i
do
say
it
was
so
mind
and
mind
you
do
go
for
to
say
it
then
we
understood
that
there
is
a
little
smuggling
done
still
and
that
we
had
helped
in
it
though
quite
without
knowing
we
were
jolly
glad
afterwards
when
we
had
had
that
talk
with
father
when
he
told
us
that
the
laws
are
made
by
the
english
people
and
it
is
dishonourable
for
an
englishman
not
to
stick
to
them
we
saw
that
smuggling
must
be
wrong
but
we
have
never
been
able
to
feel
really
sorry
i
do
not
know
why
this
is
the
mysterious
prophetess
of
the
golden
this
is
the
story
of
how
we
were
gipsies
and
wandering
minstrels
and
like
everything
else
we
did
about
that
time
it
was
done
to
make
money
for
miss
sandal
whose
poorness
kept
on
making
our
kind
hearts
ache
it
is
rather
difficult
to
get
up
any
good
game
in
a
house
like
miss
sandal
where
there
is
nothing
lying
about
except
your
own
things
and
where
everything
is
so
neat
and
necessary
your
own
clothes
are
seldom
interesting
and
even
if
you
change
hats
with
your
sisters
it
is
not
a
complete
disguise
the
idea
of
being
gipsies
was
due
to
alice
she
had
not
at
all
liked
being
entirely
out
of
the
smuggling
affray
though
oswald
explained
to
her
that
it
was
her
own
fault
for
having
been
born
a
girl
and
of
course
after
the
event
dicky
and
i
had
some
things
to
talk
about
that
the
girls
had
and
we
had
a
couple
of
wet
days
you
have
no
idea
how
dull
you
can
be
in
a
house
like
that
unless
you
happen
to
know
the
sort
of
house
i
mean
a
house
that
is
meant
for
plain
living
and
high
thinking
like
miss
sandal
told
us
may
be
very
nice
for
the
high
thinkers
but
if
you
are
not
accustomed
to
thinking
high
there
is
only
the
plain
living
left
and
it
is
like
boiled
rice
for
every
meal
to
any
young
mind
however
much
beef
and
yorkshire
there
may
be
for
the
young
insides
beale
saw
to
our
having
plenty
of
nice
things
to
eat
but
alas
it
is
not
always
and
in
between
meals
the
cold
feeling
is
very
chilling
of
course
we
had
the
splendid
drawings
of
winged
things
made
by
our
flying
lodger
but
you
can
not
look
at
pictures
all
day
long
however
many
coloured
chalks
they
are
drawn
with
and
however
fond
you
may
be
of
them
miss
sandal
was
the
kind
of
house
that
makes
you
wander
all
round
it
and
say
what
shall
we
do
next
and
when
it
rains
the
little
ones
get
cross
it
was
the
second
wet
day
when
we
were
wandering
round
the
house
to
the
sad
music
of
our
boots
on
the
clean
bare
boards
that
alice
said
beale
has
got
a
book
at
her
house
called
book
of
fate
you
might
ask
her
to
let
you
go
and
get
it
oswald
she
likes
you
best
oswald
is
as
modest
as
any
one
i
know
but
the
truth
is
the
truth
we
could
tell
our
fortunes
and
read
the
dark
future
alice
went
on
it
would
be
better
than
high
thinking
without
anything
particular
to
think
about
so
oswald
went
down
to
beale
and
said
i
say
bealie
dear
you
got
a
book
up
at
your
place
i
wish
lend
it
to
us
to
read
if
it
the
holy
book
you
mean
sir
replied
beale
going
on
with
peeling
the
potatoes
that
were
to
be
a
radiant
vision
later
on
all
brown
and
crisp
in
company
with
a
leg
of
mutton
if
it
the
holy
book
you
want
there
one
up
on
miss
sandal
chest
of
drawerses
i
know
said
oswald
he
knew
every
book
in
the
house
the
backs
of
them
were
beautiful
leather
and
gold
but
inside
they
were
like
whited
sepulchres
full
of
poetry
and
improving
reading
no
we
did
want
that
book
just
now
it
is
a
book
called
book
of
fate
would
you
mind
if
i
ran
up
to
your
place
and
got
it
there
no
one
at
home
said
beale
wait
a
bit
till
i
go
along
to
the
bakus
with
the
meat
and
i
fetch
it
along
you
might
let
me
go
said
oswald
whose
high
spirit
is
always
to
waiting
a
bit
i
would
touch
anything
else
and
i
know
where
you
keep
the
key
there
precious
little
as
ye
do
know
it
seems
to
me
said
beale
there
run
along
do
it
on
top
of
the
mantelshelf
alongside
the
picture
it
a
red
book
do
go
taking
the
conference
reports
by
mistake
the
two
is
both
together
on
the
mantel
illustration
i
say
bealie
dear
you
got
a
book
up
at
your
place
oswald
in
his
macker
splashed
through
the
mud
to
beale
found
the
key
under
the
loose
tile
behind
the
and
got
the
book
without
adventure
he
had
promised
not
to
touch
anything
else
so
he
could
not
make
even
the
gentlest
as
a
little
surprise
for
beale
when
she
got
back
and
most
of
that
day
we
were
telling
our
fortunes
by
the
ingenious
means
invented
by
the
great
emperor
or
by
cards
which
it
is
hard
to
remember
the
rules
for
or
by
our
dreams
the
only
blights
were
that
the
others
all
wanted
to
have
the
book
all
the
time
and
that
noël
dreams
were
so
long
and
mixed
that
we
got
tired
of
hearing
about
them
before
he
did
but
he
said
he
was
quite
sure
he
had
dreamed
every
single
bit
of
every
one
of
them
and
the
author
hopes
this
was
the
truth
we
all
went
to
bed
hoping
we
should
dream
something
that
we
could
look
up
in
the
dream
book
but
none
of
us
did
and
in
the
morning
it
was
still
raining
and
alice
said
look
here
if
it
ever
clears
up
again
let
dress
up
and
be
gipsies
we
can
go
about
in
the
distant
villages
telling
people
fortunes
if
you
let
me
have
the
book
all
i
can
learn
up
quite
enough
to
tell
them
mysteriously
and
darkly
and
gipsies
always
get
their
hands
crossed
with
silver
dicky
said
that
was
one
way
of
keeping
the
book
to
herself
but
oswald
said
let
her
try
she
shall
have
it
for
an
hour
and
then
we
have
an
exam
to
see
how
much
she
knows
this
was
done
but
while
she
was
swatting
the
thing
up
with
her
fingers
in
her
ears
we
began
to
talk
about
how
gipsies
should
be
dressed
and
when
we
all
went
out
of
the
room
to
see
if
we
could
find
anything
in
that
tidy
house
to
dress
up
in
she
came
after
us
to
see
what
was
up
so
there
was
no
exam
we
peeped
into
the
cupboards
and
drawers
in
miss
sandal
room
but
everything
was
grey
or
brown
not
at
all
the
sort
of
thing
to
dress
up
for
children
of
the
sunny
south
in
the
plain
living
was
shown
in
all
her
clothes
and
besides
grey
shows
every
little
spot
you
may
happen
to
get
on
it
we
were
almost
in
despair
we
looked
in
all
the
drawers
in
all
the
rooms
but
found
only
sheets
and
tablecloths
and
more
grey
and
brown
clothing
we
tried
the
attic
with
fainting
hearts
servants
clothes
are
always
good
for
with
they
have
so
many
different
colours
but
miss
sandal
had
no
servant
still
she
might
have
had
one
once
and
the
servant
might
have
left
something
behind
her
dora
suggested
this
and
added
if
you
do
find
anything
in
the
attic
you
know
it
fate
and
you
not
to
do
it
besides
i
almost
sure
you
can
be
put
in
prison
for
telling
fortunes
not
if
you
a
gipsy
you
ca
said
noël
they
have
licences
to
tell
fortunes
i
believe
and
judges
ca
do
anything
to
them
so
we
went
up
to
the
attic
and
it
was
as
bare
and
tidy
as
the
rest
of
the
house
but
there
were
some
boxes
and
we
looked
in
them
the
smallest
was
full
of
old
letters
so
we
shut
it
again
at
once
another
had
books
in
it
and
the
last
had
a
clean
towel
spread
over
what
was
inside
so
we
took
off
the
towel
and
then
every
one
said
oh
in
right
on
the
top
was
a
scarlet
thing
embroidered
heavily
with
gold
it
proved
on
unfolding
to
be
a
sort
of
coat
like
a
chinaman
we
lifted
it
out
and
laid
it
on
the
towel
on
the
floor
and
then
the
full
glories
of
that
box
were
revealed
there
were
cloaks
and
dresses
and
skirts
and
scarves
of
all
the
colours
of
a
rainbow
and
all
made
of
the
most
beautiful
silks
and
stuffs
with
things
worked
on
them
with
silk
as
well
as
chains
of
beads
and
many
lovely
ornaments
we
think
miss
sandal
must
have
been
very
fond
of
pretty
things
when
she
was
young
or
when
she
was
better
off
well
there
wo
be
any
gipsies
near
by
to
come
up
to
said
oswald
joyously
do
you
think
we
ought
to
take
them
without
asking
said
dora
of
course
not
said
oswald
witheringly
we
ought
to
write
to
her
and
say
miss
sandal
we
know
how
poor
you
are
and
may
we
borrow
your
things
to
be
gipsies
in
so
as
we
get
money
for
you
all
right
you
go
and
write
the
letter
dora
i
only
just
asked
said
dora
we
tried
the
things
on
some
of
them
were
so
ladylike
that
they
were
no
good
evening
dresses
and
things
like
that
but
there
were
enough
useful
things
to
go
round
oswald
in
white
shirt
and
flannel
tied
a
silk
scarf
round
his
middle
part
and
a
green
one
round
his
head
for
a
turban
the
turban
was
fastened
with
a
sparkling
brooch
with
pink
stones
in
it
he
looked
like
a
moorish
toreador
dicky
had
the
scarlet
and
gold
coat
which
was
the
right
length
when
dora
had
run
a
tuck
in
it
alice
had
a
blue
skirt
with
embroidery
of
peacock
feathers
on
it
and
a
gold
and
black
jacket
very
short
with
no
sleeves
and
a
yellow
silk
handkerchief
on
her
head
like
italian
peasants
and
another
handkie
round
her
neck
dora
skirt
was
green
and
her
handkerchiefs
purple
and
pink
noël
insisted
on
having
his
two
scarves
one
green
and
one
yellow
twisted
on
his
legs
like
putties
and
a
red
scarf
wound
round
his
and
he
stuck
a
long
ostrich
feather
in
his
own
bicycle
cap
and
said
he
was
a
troubadour
bard
was
able
to
wear
a
lady
blouse
of
silk
embroidered
with
poppies
it
came
down
to
his
knees
and
a
jewelled
belt
kept
it
in
place
we
made
up
our
costumes
into
bundles
and
alice
thoughtfully
bought
a
pennyworth
of
pins
of
course
it
was
idle
to
suppose
that
we
could
go
through
the
village
in
our
gipsy
clothes
without
exciting
remark
the
more
we
thought
of
it
the
more
it
seemed
as
if
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
get
some
way
from
our
village
before
we
began
our
gipsy
career
the
woman
at
the
sweet
shop
where
alice
got
the
pins
has
a
donkey
and
cart
and
for
two
shillings
she
consented
to
lend
us
this
so
that
some
of
us
could
walk
while
some
of
us
would
always
be
resting
in
the
cart
and
next
morning
the
weather
was
bright
and
blue
as
ever
and
we
started
we
were
beautifully
clean
but
all
our
hairs
had
been
arranged
with
the
brush
solely
because
at
the
last
moment
nobody
could
find
comb
beale
had
packed
up
a
jolly
sandwichy
and
apply
lunch
for
us
we
told
her
we
were
going
to
gather
bluebells
in
the
woods
and
of
course
we
meant
to
do
that
too
the
drew
up
at
the
door
and
we
started
it
was
found
impossible
to
get
every
one
into
the
cart
at
once
so
we
agreed
to
cast
lots
for
who
should
run
behind
and
to
take
it
in
turns
mile
and
mile
the
lot
fell
on
dora
and
but
there
was
precious
little
running
about
it
anything
slower
than
that
donkey
oswald
has
never
known
and
when
it
came
to
passing
its
own
front
door
the
donkey
simply
would
not
it
ended
in
oswald
getting
down
and
going
to
the
animal
head
and
having
it
out
with
him
man
to
man
the
donkey
was
small
but
of
enormous
strength
he
set
all
his
four
feet
firm
and
leant
back
and
oswald
set
his
two
feet
firm
and
leant
back
so
that
oswald
and
the
front
part
of
the
donkey
formed
an
angry
and
contentious
letter
and
oswald
gazed
in
the
donkey
eyes
in
a
dauntless
manner
and
the
donkey
looked
at
oswald
as
though
it
thought
he
was
hay
or
thistles
alice
beat
the
donkey
from
the
cart
with
a
stick
that
had
been
given
us
for
the
purpose
the
rest
shouted
but
all
was
in
vain
and
four
people
in
a
motor
car
stopped
it
to
see
the
heroic
struggle
and
laughed
till
i
thought
they
would
have
upset
their
hateful
motor
however
it
was
all
for
the
best
though
oswald
did
not
see
it
at
the
time
when
they
had
had
enough
of
laughing
they
started
their
machine
again
and
the
noise
it
made
penetrated
the
donkey
dull
intelligence
and
he
started
off
without
a
word
i
mean
without
any
warning
and
oswald
has
only
just
time
to
throw
himself
clear
of
the
wheels
before
he
fell
on
the
ground
and
rolled
over
biting
the
dust
the
motor
car
people
behaved
as
you
would
expect
but
accidents
happen
even
to
motor
cars
when
people
laugh
too
long
and
too
unfeelingly
the
driver
turned
round
to
laugh
and
the
motor
instantly
took
the
bit
between
its
teeth
and
bolted
into
the
stone
wall
of
the
churchyard
no
one
was
hurt
except
the
motor
but
that
had
to
spend
the
day
at
the
blacksmith
we
heard
afterwards
thus
was
the
outraged
oswald
avenged
by
fate
illustration
alice
beat
the
donkey
from
the
cart
the
rest
shouted
he
was
not
hurt
either
though
much
the
motor
people
would
have
cared
if
he
had
been
and
he
caught
up
with
the
others
at
the
end
of
the
village
for
the
donkey
pace
had
been
too
good
to
last
and
the
triumphal
progress
was
resumed
it
was
some
time
before
we
found
a
wood
sufficiently
for
our
secret
purposes
there
are
no
woods
close
to
the
village
but
at
last
up
by
bonnington
we
found
one
and
tying
our
noble
steed
to
the
that
says
how
many
miles
it
is
to
ashford
we
cast
a
hasty
glance
round
and
finding
no
one
in
sight
disappeared
in
the
wood
with
our
bundles
we
went
in
just
ordinary
creatures
we
came
out
gipsies
of
the
deepest
dye
for
we
had
got
a
pennorth
of
walnut
stain
from
jameson
the
builder
and
mixed
with
water
the
water
we
had
brought
in
a
it
was
a
prime
disguise
and
we
knew
it
would
wash
off
unlike
the
condy
fluid
we
once
stained
ourselves
with
during
a
game
of
we
had
put
on
all
the
glorious
things
we
had
bagged
from
miss
attic
treasures
but
still
alice
had
a
small
bundle
unopened
what
that
dora
asked
i
meant
to
keep
it
as
a
reserve
force
in
case
the
did
turn
out
all
our
fancy
painted
it
said
alice
but
i
do
mind
telling
you
now
she
opened
the
bundle
and
there
was
a
tambourine
some
black
lace
a
packet
of
cigarette
papers
and
our
missing
combs
what
ever
on
earth
dicky
was
beginning
but
oswald
saw
it
all
he
has
a
wonderfully
keen
nose
and
he
said
bully
for
you
alice
i
wish
i
thought
it
myself
alice
was
much
pleased
by
this
handsome
speech
yes
she
said
perhaps
really
it
would
be
best
to
begin
with
it
it
would
attract
the
public
attention
and
then
we
could
tell
the
fortunes
you
see
she
kindly
explained
to
dicky
and
and
dora
who
had
not
seen
it
yet
though
noël
had
almost
as
soon
as
i
did
you
see
we
all
play
on
the
combs
with
the
veils
over
our
faces
so
that
no
one
can
see
what
our
instruments
are
why
they
might
be
for
anything
any
one
will
know
or
some
costly
instruments
from
the
east
like
they
play
to
sultans
in
zenanas
let
just
try
a
tune
or
two
before
we
go
on
to
be
sure
that
all
the
combs
work
right
dora
has
such
big
teeth
i
should
wonder
if
it
would
act
at
all
so
we
all
papered
our
combs
and
did
heroes
but
that
sounded
awful
the
girl
i
left
behind
me
went
better
and
so
did
bonnie
dundee
but
we
thought
see
the
conquering
or
the
death
of
nelson
would
be
the
best
to
begin
with
it
was
beastly
hot
doing
it
under
the
veils
but
when
oswald
had
done
one
tune
without
the
veil
to
see
how
the
others
looked
he
could
not
help
owning
that
the
veils
did
give
a
hidden
mystery
that
was
a
stranger
to
simple
combs
we
were
all
a
bit
puffed
when
we
had
played
for
awhile
so
we
decided
that
as
the
donkey
seemed
calm
and
was
eating
grass
and
resting
we
might
as
well
follow
his
example
we
ought
not
to
be
too
proud
to
take
pattern
by
the
brute
creation
said
dora
so
we
had
our
lunch
in
the
wood
we
lighted
a
little
fire
of
sticks
and
so
as
to
be
as
gipsyish
as
we
could
and
we
sat
round
the
fire
we
made
a
charming
picture
in
our
bright
clothes
among
what
would
have
been
our
native
surroundings
if
we
had
been
real
gipsies
and
we
knew
how
nice
we
looked
and
stayed
there
though
the
smoke
got
in
our
eyes
and
everything
we
ate
tasted
of
it
the
woods
were
a
little
damp
and
that
was
why
the
fire
smoked
so
there
were
the
jackets
we
had
cast
off
when
we
dressed
up
to
sit
on
and
there
was
a
in
the
cart
intended
for
the
donkey
wear
but
we
decided
that
our
need
was
greater
than
its
so
we
took
the
blanket
to
recline
on
it
was
as
jolly
a
lunch
as
ever
i
remember
and
we
lingered
over
that
and
looking
romantic
till
we
could
not
bear
the
smoke
any
more
then
we
got
a
lot
of
bluebells
and
we
trampled
out
the
fire
most
carefully
because
we
know
about
not
setting
woods
and
places
alight
rolled
up
our
clothes
in
bundles
and
went
out
of
the
shadowy
woodland
into
the
bright
sunlight
as
sparkling
looking
a
crew
of
gipsies
as
any
one
need
wish
for
last
time
we
had
seen
the
road
it
had
been
quite
white
and
bare
of
persons
walking
on
it
but
now
there
were
several
and
not
only
walkers
but
people
in
carts
and
some
carriages
passed
us
too
every
one
stared
at
us
but
they
did
not
seem
so
astonished
as
we
had
every
right
to
expect
and
though
interested
they
were
not
rude
and
this
is
very
rare
among
english
people
and
not
only
poor
people
either
when
they
see
anything
at
all
out
of
the
way
we
asked
one
man
who
was
very
indeed
in
black
clothes
and
a
blue
tie
where
every
one
was
going
for
every
one
was
going
the
same
way
and
every
one
looked
as
if
it
was
going
to
church
which
was
unlikely
it
being
but
thursday
he
said
same
place
wot
you
going
to
i
expect
and
when
we
said
where
was
that
we
were
requested
by
him
to
get
along
with
us
which
we
did
an
old
woman
in
the
heaviest
bonnet
i
have
ever
seen
and
the
highest
it
was
like
a
black
church
revealed
the
secret
to
us
and
we
learned
that
there
was
a
primrose
going
on
in
sir
willoughby
grounds
we
instantly
decided
to
go
to
the
i
been
to
a
primrose
and
so
have
you
dora
oswald
remarked
and
people
are
so
dull
at
them
they
gladly
give
gold
to
see
the
dark
future
and
besides
the
villages
will
be
unpopulated
and
no
one
at
home
but
idiots
and
babies
and
their
keepers
so
we
went
to
the
the
people
got
thicker
and
thicker
and
when
we
got
to
sir
lodge
gates
which
have
sprawling
lions
on
the
we
were
told
to
take
the
donkey
cart
round
to
the
this
we
did
and
proud
was
the
moment
when
a
stiff
groom
had
to
bend
his
proud
stomach
to
go
to
the
head
of
bates
donkey
this
is
something
like
said
alice
and
noël
added
the
foreign
princes
are
well
received
at
this
palace
we
are
princes
we
gipsies
said
dora
tucking
his
scarf
in
it
would
keep
on
getting
loose
there
gipsy
princes
though
said
noël
because
there
are
gipsy
kings
you
are
always
a
prince
first
said
dora
do
wriggle
so
or
i
ca
fix
you
sometimes
being
made
a
king
just
happens
to
some
one
who
is
any
one
in
particular
i
do
think
so
said
noël
you
have
to
be
a
prince
before
you
a
king
just
as
you
have
to
be
a
kitten
before
you
a
cat
or
a
puppy
before
you
a
dog
or
a
worm
before
you
a
serpent
or
what
about
the
king
of
sweden
dora
was
beginning
when
a
very
nice
tall
thin
man
with
white
flowers
in
his
buttonhole
like
for
a
wedding
came
strolling
up
and
said
and
whose
show
is
this
eh
what
we
said
it
was
ours
are
you
expected
he
asked
we
said
we
thought
not
but
we
hoped
he
did
mind
what
are
you
acrobats
that
a
ripping
burmese
coat
you
got
there
yes
it
is
no
we
are
said
alice
with
dignity
i
am
zaïda
the
mysterious
prophetess
of
the
golden
orient
and
the
others
are
mysterious
too
but
we
have
fixed
on
their
names
yet
by
jove
said
the
gentleman
but
who
are
you
really
our
names
are
our
secret
said
oswald
with
dignity
but
alice
said
oh
but
we
do
mind
telling
because
i
sure
you
nice
we
really
the
bastables
and
we
want
to
get
some
money
for
some
one
we
know
that
rather
poor
of
course
i
ca
tell
you
name
and
we
learnt
how
to
tell
fortunes
really
we
have
do
you
think
let
us
tell
them
at
the
people
are
often
dull
at
they
by
jove
said
the
gentleman
again
by
jove
they
are
he
plunged
for
a
moment
in
deep
reflection
we
got
co
musical
instruments
said
noël
shall
we
play
to
you
a
little
not
here
said
the
gentleman
follow
me
he
led
the
way
by
the
backs
of
shrubberies
to
an
old
and
we
asked
him
to
wait
outside
then
we
put
on
our
veils
and
tuned
up
see
see
the
conquering
but
he
did
not
let
us
finish
the
tune
he
burst
in
upon
us
crying
ripping
oh
ripping
and
now
tell
me
my
fortune
alice
took
off
her
veil
and
looked
at
his
hand
you
will
travel
in
distant
lands
she
said
you
will
have
great
wealth
and
honour
you
will
marry
a
beautiful
lady
a
very
fine
woman
it
says
in
the
book
but
i
think
a
beautiful
lady
sounds
nicer
you
illustration
we
got
musical
instruments
said
noël
much
but
i
should
mention
the
book
when
you
telling
the
fortune
i
would
except
to
you
said
alice
and
she
have
lots
of
money
and
a
very
sweet
disposition
trials
and
troubles
beset
your
path
but
do
but
be
brave
and
fearless
and
you
will
overcome
all
your
enemies
beware
of
a
dark
woman
most
likely
a
widow
i
will
said
he
for
alice
had
stopped
for
breath
is
that
all
no
beware
of
a
dark
woman
and
shun
the
society
of
drunkards
and
gamblers
be
very
cautious
in
your
choice
of
acquaintances
or
you
will
make
a
false
friend
who
will
be
your
ruin
that
all
except
that
you
will
be
married
very
soon
and
live
to
a
green
old
age
with
the
beloved
wife
of
your
bosom
and
have
twelve
sons
and
stop
stop
said
the
gentleman
twelve
sons
are
as
many
as
i
can
bring
up
handsomely
on
my
present
income
now
look
here
you
did
that
jolly
well
only
go
slower
and
pretend
to
look
for
things
in
the
hand
before
you
say
them
everything
free
at
the
so
you
get
no
money
for
your
gloom
was
on
each
young
brow
it
like
this
he
went
on
there
is
a
lady
in
a
tent
in
the
park
then
we
may
as
well
get
along
home
said
dicky
not
at
all
said
our
new
friend
for
such
he
was
now
about
to
prove
himself
to
be
that
lady
does
not
want
to
tell
fortunes
she
has
a
headache
now
if
you
really
stick
to
it
and
tell
the
fortunes
as
well
as
you
told
mine
i
stand
you
let
see
two
quid
for
the
afternoon
will
that
do
what
we
said
we
should
just
jolly
well
think
it
would
i
got
some
eau
de
cologne
in
a
dora
said
my
brother
noël
has
headaches
sometimes
but
i
think
he
going
to
be
all
right
do
take
it
it
will
do
the
lady
head
good
i
take
care
of
her
head
he
said
laughing
but
he
took
the
bottle
and
said
thank
you
then
he
told
us
to
stay
where
we
were
while
he
made
final
arrangements
and
we
were
left
with
palpitating
breasts
to
look
wildly
through
the
book
of
fate
so
as
to
have
the
things
ready
but
it
turned
out
to
be
time
thrown
away
for
when
he
came
back
he
said
to
alice
it
have
to
be
only
you
and
your
sister
please
for
i
see
stuck
up
a
card
with
the
gipsy
princess
reads
the
hand
and
foretells
the
future
on
it
so
you
boys
will
have
to
be
mum
you
can
be
attendants
mutes
by
jove
yes
that
it
and
i
say
kiddies
you
will
jolly
well
play
up
wo
you
do
stand
any
cheek
stick
it
on
you
know
i
ca
tell
you
how
important
it
is
about
about
the
headache
i
should
think
this
would
be
a
cool
place
for
a
headache
to
be
quiet
in
said
dora
and
it
was
for
it
was
quite
hidden
in
the
shrubbery
and
no
path
to
it
by
jove
he
remarked
yet
once
again
so
it
would
you
right
he
led
us
out
of
the
shrubbery
and
across
the
park
there
were
people
dotted
all
about
and
they
stared
but
they
touched
their
hats
to
the
gentleman
and
he
returned
their
salute
with
stern
politeness
inside
the
tent
with
esmeralda
outside
there
was
a
lady
in
a
hat
and
but
we
could
see
her
spangles
under
the
cloak
now
said
the
gentleman
to
dicky
you
stand
at
the
door
and
let
people
in
one
at
a
time
you
others
can
just
play
a
few
bars
on
your
instruments
for
each
new
person
only
a
very
little
because
you
do
get
out
of
tune
though
that
barbaric
certainly
now
here
the
two
quid
and
you
stick
to
the
show
till
five
you
hear
the
stable
clock
chime
the
lady
was
very
pale
with
black
marks
under
her
eyes
and
her
eyes
looked
red
oswald
thought
she
seemed
about
to
speak
but
the
gentleman
said
do
trust
me
ella
i
explain
everything
directly
just
go
to
the
old
know
and
i
be
there
directly
i
take
a
couple
of
pegs
out
of
the
back
and
you
can
slip
away
among
the
trees
hold
your
cloak
close
over
your
gown
goodbye
kiddies
stay
give
me
your
address
and
i
write
and
tell
you
if
my
fortune
comes
true
so
he
shook
hands
with
us
and
went
and
we
did
stick
to
it
though
it
is
far
less
fun
than
you
would
think
telling
fortunes
all
the
afternoon
in
a
stuffy
tent
while
outside
you
know
there
are
things
to
eat
and
people
enjoying
themselves
but
there
were
the
two
gold
quid
and
we
were
determined
to
earn
them
it
is
very
hard
to
tell
a
different
fortune
for
each
person
and
there
were
a
great
many
the
girls
took
it
in
turns
and
oswald
wonders
why
their
hairs
did
not
go
gray
though
of
course
it
was
much
better
fun
for
them
than
for
us
because
we
had
just
to
be
mutes
when
we
were
playing
on
the
combs
the
people
we
told
fortunes
to
at
first
laughed
rather
and
said
we
were
too
young
to
know
anything
but
oswald
said
in
a
hollow
voice
that
we
were
as
old
as
the
pyramids
and
after
that
alice
took
the
tucks
out
of
dicky
red
coat
and
put
it
on
and
turbaned
herself
and
looked
much
older
the
stable
clock
had
chimed
the
quarter
to
five
some
little
time
when
an
elderly
gentleman
with
whiskers
who
afterwards
proved
to
be
sir
willoughby
burst
into
the
tent
where
miss
blockson
he
said
and
we
answered
truthfully
that
we
did
not
know
how
long
have
you
been
here
he
furiously
asked
ever
since
two
said
alice
wearily
he
said
a
word
that
i
should
have
thought
a
baronet
would
have
been
above
using
who
brought
you
here
we
described
the
gentleman
who
had
done
this
and
again
the
baronet
said
things
we
should
never
be
allowed
to
say
that
confounded
carew
he
added
with
more
words
is
anything
wrong
asked
dora
can
we
do
anything
we
stay
on
longer
if
you
like
if
you
ca
find
the
lady
who
was
doing
esmeralda
before
we
came
i
not
very
likely
to
find
her
he
said
ferociously
stay
longer
indeed
get
away
out
of
my
sight
before
i
have
you
locked
up
for
vagrants
and
vagabonds
he
left
the
scene
in
bounding
and
mad
fury
we
thought
it
best
to
do
as
he
said
and
went
round
the
back
way
to
the
stables
so
as
to
avoid
exciting
his
ungoverned
rage
by
meeting
him
again
we
found
our
cart
and
went
home
we
had
got
two
quid
and
something
to
talk
about
but
none
of
us
not
even
oswald
the
discerning
understood
exactly
what
we
had
been
mixed
up
in
till
the
pink
satin
box
with
three
large
bottles
of
scent
in
it
and
postmarks
of
foreign
lands
came
to
dora
and
there
was
a
letter
it
said
my
dear
gipsies
i
beg
to
return
the
eau
de
cologne
you
so
kindly
lent
me
the
lady
did
use
a
little
of
it
but
i
found
that
foreign
travel
was
what
she
really
wanted
to
make
her
quite
happy
so
we
caught
the
to
town
and
now
we
are
married
and
intend
to
live
to
a
green
old
age
as
you
foretold
but
for
your
help
my
fortune
could
have
come
true
because
my
wife
father
sir
willoughby
thought
i
was
not
rich
enough
to
marry
but
you
see
i
was
and
my
wife
and
i
both
thank
you
heartily
for
your
kind
help
i
hope
it
was
not
an
awful
swat
i
had
to
say
five
because
of
the
train
good
luck
to
you
and
thanks
awfully
yours
faithfully
carisbrook
carew
if
oswald
had
known
beforehand
we
should
never
have
made
that
two
quid
for
miss
sandal
for
oswald
does
not
approve
of
marriages
and
would
never
if
he
knew
it
be
the
means
of
assisting
one
to
occur
lady
and
the
license
or
friendship
my
dear
kiddies
miss
sandal
married
sister
has
just
come
home
from
australia
and
she
feels
very
tired
no
wonder
you
will
say
after
such
a
long
journey
so
she
is
going
to
lymchurch
to
rest
now
i
want
you
all
to
be
very
quiet
because
when
you
are
in
your
usual
form
you
are
exactly
restful
are
you
if
this
weather
lasts
you
will
be
able
to
be
out
most
of
the
time
and
when
you
are
indoors
for
goodness
sake
control
your
lungs
and
your
boots
especially
bax
has
travelled
about
a
good
deal
and
once
was
nearly
eaten
by
cannibals
but
i
hope
you
wo
bother
her
to
tell
you
stories
she
is
coming
on
friday
i
am
glad
to
hear
from
alice
letter
that
you
enjoyed
the
primrose
fête
tell
noël
that
is
not
the
usual
way
of
spelling
the
word
he
wants
i
send
you
ten
shillings
for
and
again
implore
you
to
let
bax
have
a
little
rest
and
peace
your
loving
father
if
you
want
anything
sent
down
tell
me
and
i
will
get
bax
to
bring
it
i
met
your
friend
red
house
the
other
day
at
lunch
when
the
letter
had
been
read
aloud
and
we
had
each
read
it
to
ourselves
a
sad
silence
took
place
dicky
was
the
first
to
speak
it
rather
beastly
i
grant
you
he
said
but
it
might
be
worse
i
do
see
how
said
i
do
wish
father
would
jolly
well
learn
to
leave
my
boots
alone
it
might
be
worse
i
tell
you
said
dicky
suppose
instead
of
telling
us
to
keep
out
of
doors
it
had
been
the
other
way
yes
said
alice
suppose
it
had
been
bax
requires
to
be
cheered
up
do
not
leave
her
side
day
or
night
take
it
in
turns
to
make
jokes
for
her
let
not
a
moment
pass
without
some
merry
jest
oh
yes
it
might
be
much
much
worse
being
able
to
get
out
all
day
makes
it
all
right
about
trying
to
make
that
two
pounds
increase
and
multiply
remarked
oswald
now
going
to
meet
her
at
the
station
because
after
all
it
her
house
and
we
got
to
be
polite
to
visitors
even
if
we
in
a
house
we
are
related
to
this
was
seen
to
be
so
but
no
one
was
keen
on
going
to
the
station
at
last
oswald
ever
ready
for
forlorn
hopes
consented
to
go
we
told
beale
and
she
got
the
best
room
ready
scrubbing
everything
till
it
smelt
deliciously
of
wet
wood
and
mottled
soap
and
then
we
decorated
the
room
as
well
as
we
could
she
want
some
pretty
things
said
alice
coming
from
the
land
of
parrots
and
opossums
and
and
things
we
did
think
of
borrowing
the
stuffed
that
is
in
the
bar
at
the
ship
but
we
decided
that
our
decorations
must
be
very
quiet
and
the
even
in
its
stuffed
state
was
anything
but
so
we
borrowed
a
stuffed
roach
in
a
glass
box
and
stood
it
on
the
chest
of
drawers
it
looked
very
calm
are
quiet
things
when
they
are
vacant
and
beale
let
us
have
the
four
big
ones
off
her
chiffonnier
the
girls
got
flowers
bluebells
and
white
we
might
have
had
poppies
or
buttercups
but
we
thought
the
colours
might
be
too
loud
we
took
some
books
up
for
bax
to
read
in
the
night
and
we
took
the
quietest
ones
we
could
find
sonnets
on
sleep
confessions
of
an
opium
eater
twilight
of
the
gods
diary
of
a
dreamer
and
by
still
waters
were
some
of
them
the
girls
covered
them
with
grey
paper
because
some
of
the
bindings
were
rather
gay
the
girls
hemmed
grey
calico
covers
for
the
drawers
and
the
and
we
drew
the
blinds
and
when
all
was
done
the
room
looked
as
quiet
as
a
roosting
we
put
in
a
clock
but
we
did
not
wind
it
up
she
can
do
that
herself
said
dora
if
she
feels
she
can
bear
to
hear
it
ticking
oswald
went
to
the
station
to
meet
her
he
rode
on
the
box
beside
the
driver
when
the
others
saw
him
mount
there
i
think
they
were
sorry
they
had
not
been
polite
and
gone
to
meet
her
themselves
oswald
had
a
jolly
ride
we
got
to
the
station
just
as
the
train
came
in
only
one
lady
got
out
of
it
so
oswald
knew
it
must
be
bax
if
he
had
not
been
told
how
quiet
she
wanted
to
be
he
would
have
thought
she
looked
rather
jolly
she
had
short
hair
and
gold
spectacles
her
skirts
were
short
and
she
carried
a
in
her
hand
it
contained
our
parrot
and
when
we
wrote
to
tell
father
that
it
and
pincher
were
the
only
things
we
wanted
sent
we
never
thought
she
would
have
brought
either
bax
i
believe
was
the
only
break
oswald
made
in
the
polite
silence
that
he
took
the
and
her
bag
from
her
in
how
do
you
do
she
said
very
briskly
for
a
tired
lady
and
oswald
thought
it
was
noble
of
her
to
make
the
effort
to
smile
are
you
oswald
or
dicky
oswald
told
her
in
one
calm
word
which
he
was
and
then
pincher
rolled
madly
out
of
a
almost
into
his
arms
pincher
would
not
be
quiet
of
course
he
did
not
understand
the
need
for
it
oswald
conversed
with
pincher
in
low
restraining
whispers
as
he
led
the
way
to
the
ship
fly
he
put
the
on
the
inside
seat
of
the
carriage
held
the
door
open
for
bax
with
silent
politeness
closed
it
as
quietly
as
possible
and
prepared
to
mount
on
the
box
oh
wo
you
come
inside
asked
bax
do
no
thank
you
said
oswald
in
calm
and
tones
and
to
avoid
any
more
jaw
he
got
at
once
on
to
the
box
with
pincher
so
that
bax
was
perfectly
quiet
for
the
whole
six
miles
unless
you
count
the
rattle
and
of
the
fly
on
the
box
oswald
and
pincher
tasted
the
sweets
of
a
blissful
like
it
says
in
novels
and
the
man
from
the
ship
looked
on
and
said
how
well
bred
pincher
was
it
was
a
happy
drive
there
was
something
almost
awful
about
the
sleek
quiet
tidiness
of
the
others
who
were
all
standing
in
a
row
outside
the
cottage
to
welcome
bax
they
all
said
how
do
you
do
in
hushed
voices
and
all
looked
as
if
butter
would
not
melt
in
any
of
their
young
mouths
i
never
saw
a
more
lot
of
kids
she
went
to
her
room
and
we
did
not
see
her
again
till
then
still
exquisitely
brushed
and
combed
we
sat
round
the
board
in
silence
we
had
left
the
place
for
bax
of
course
but
she
said
to
dora
would
you
like
to
pour
out
and
dora
replied
in
low
soft
tones
if
you
wish
me
to
bax
i
usually
do
and
she
did
we
passed
each
other
and
jam
and
honey
with
silent
courteousness
and
of
course
we
saw
that
she
had
enough
to
eat
do
you
manage
to
amuse
yourself
pretty
well
here
she
asked
presently
we
said
yes
thank
you
in
hushed
tones
what
do
you
do
she
asked
we
did
not
wish
to
excite
her
by
telling
her
what
we
did
so
dicky
murmured
nothing
in
particular
at
the
same
moment
that
alice
said
all
sorts
of
things
tell
me
about
them
said
bax
invitingly
we
replied
by
a
deep
silence
she
sighed
and
passed
her
cup
for
more
tea
do
you
ever
feel
shy
she
asked
suddenly
i
do
dreadfully
with
new
people
we
liked
her
for
saying
that
and
alice
replied
that
she
hoped
she
would
not
feel
shy
with
us
i
hope
not
she
said
do
you
know
there
was
such
a
funny
woman
in
the
train
she
had
seventeen
different
parcels
and
she
kept
counting
them
and
one
of
them
was
a
kitten
and
it
was
always
under
the
seat
when
she
began
to
count
so
she
always
got
the
number
wrong
we
should
have
liked
to
hear
about
that
kitten
especially
what
colour
it
was
and
how
old
but
oswald
felt
that
bax
was
only
trying
to
talk
for
our
sakes
so
that
we
should
feel
shy
so
he
simply
said
will
you
have
some
more
cake
and
nothing
more
was
said
about
the
kitten
bax
seemed
very
noble
she
kept
trying
to
talk
to
us
about
pincher
and
trains
and
australia
but
we
were
determined
she
should
be
quiet
as
she
wished
it
so
much
and
we
restrained
our
brimming
curiosity
about
opossums
up
and
about
emus
and
kangaroos
and
wattles
and
only
said
yes
or
no
or
more
often
nothing
at
all
when
tea
was
over
we
melted
away
like
in
thawjean
and
went
out
on
the
beach
and
had
a
yelling
match
our
throats
felt
as
though
they
were
full
of
wool
from
the
hushed
tones
we
had
used
in
talking
to
bax
oswald
won
the
match
next
day
we
kept
carefully
out
of
the
way
except
for
meals
bax
tried
talking
again
at
but
we
checked
our
wish
to
listen
and
passed
the
pepper
salt
mustard
bread
toast
butter
marmalade
and
even
the
cayenne
vinegar
and
oil
with
such
politeness
that
she
gave
up
we
took
it
in
turns
to
watch
the
house
and
drive
away
we
told
them
they
must
not
play
in
front
of
that
house
because
there
was
an
australian
lady
who
had
to
be
kept
quiet
and
they
went
at
once
this
cost
us
expense
because
an
will
never
consent
to
fly
the
spot
under
twopence
a
flight
we
went
to
bed
early
we
were
quite
weary
with
being
so
calm
and
still
but
we
knew
it
was
our
duty
and
we
liked
the
feel
of
having
done
it
the
day
after
was
the
day
jake
lee
got
hurt
jake
is
the
man
who
drives
about
the
country
in
a
covered
cart
with
pins
and
needles
and
combs
and
and
all
the
sort
of
things
that
farmers
wives
are
likely
to
want
in
a
hurry
and
no
shops
for
miles
i
have
always
thought
jake
was
a
beautiful
life
i
should
like
to
do
it
myself
well
this
particular
day
he
had
got
his
cart
all
ready
to
start
and
had
got
his
foot
on
the
wheel
to
get
up
when
a
went
by
puffing
and
hooting
i
always
think
seem
so
rude
somehow
and
the
horse
was
frightened
and
no
wonder
it
shied
and
poor
jake
was
thrown
violently
to
the
ground
and
hurt
so
much
that
they
had
to
send
for
the
doctor
of
course
we
went
and
asked
jake
if
we
could
do
anything
such
as
take
the
cart
out
and
sell
the
things
to
the
wives
but
she
thought
not
it
was
after
this
that
dicky
said
why
should
we
get
things
of
our
own
and
go
and
sell
them
with
bates
donkey
oswald
was
thinking
the
same
thing
but
he
wishes
to
be
fair
so
he
owns
that
dicky
spoke
first
we
all
saw
at
once
that
the
idea
was
a
good
one
shall
we
dress
up
for
it
asked
we
thought
not
it
is
always
good
sport
to
dress
up
but
i
have
never
heard
of
people
selling
things
to
farmers
wives
in
really
beautiful
disguises
we
ought
to
go
as
shabby
as
we
can
said
alice
but
somehow
that
always
seems
to
come
natural
to
your
clothes
when
you
done
a
few
interesting
things
in
them
we
have
plenty
of
clothes
that
look
poor
but
deserving
what
shall
we
buy
to
sell
pins
and
needles
and
tape
and
bodkins
said
dora
butter
said
noël
it
is
terrible
when
there
is
no
butter
honey
is
nice
said
and
so
are
sausages
jake
has
shirts
and
corduroy
trousers
i
suppose
a
shirt
and
trousers
may
give
at
any
moment
said
alice
and
if
he
get
new
ones
he
has
to
go
to
bed
till
they
are
mended
oswald
thought
and
glue
and
string
must
often
be
needed
to
mend
barns
and
farm
tools
with
if
they
broke
suddenly
and
dicky
said
i
think
the
pictures
of
ladies
hanging
on
to
crosses
in
foaming
seas
are
good
jake
told
me
he
sold
more
of
them
than
anything
i
suppose
people
suddenly
break
the
old
ones
and
home
is
home
without
a
lady
holding
on
to
a
cross
we
went
to
munn
shop
and
we
bought
needles
and
pins
and
tapes
and
bodkins
a
pound
of
butter
a
pot
of
honey
and
one
of
marmalade
and
string
and
glue
but
we
could
not
get
any
ladies
with
crosses
and
the
shirts
and
trousers
were
too
expensive
for
us
to
dare
to
risk
it
instead
we
bought
a
for
eighteenpence
because
how
providential
we
should
be
to
a
farmer
whose
favourite
horse
had
escaped
and
he
had
nothing
to
catch
it
with
and
three
in
case
of
a
distant
farm
subsisting
entirely
on
tinned
things
and
the
only
opener
for
miles
lost
down
the
well
or
something
we
also
bought
several
other
thoughtful
and
things
that
night
at
supper
we
told
bax
we
wanted
to
go
out
for
the
day
she
had
hardly
said
anything
that
and
now
she
said
where
are
you
going
teaching
sunday
school
as
it
was
monday
we
felt
her
poor
brain
was
wandering
most
likely
for
want
of
quiet
and
the
room
smelt
of
tobacco
smoke
so
we
thought
some
one
had
been
to
see
her
and
perhaps
been
too
noisy
for
her
so
oswald
said
gently
no
we
are
not
going
to
teach
sunday
school
bax
sighed
then
she
said
i
am
going
out
myself
for
the
day
i
hope
it
will
not
tire
you
too
much
said
dora
with
and
cautious
politeness
if
you
want
anything
bought
we
could
do
it
for
you
with
pleasure
and
you
could
have
a
nice
quiet
day
at
home
thank
you
said
bax
shortly
and
we
saw
she
would
do
what
she
chose
whether
it
was
really
for
her
own
good
or
not
she
started
before
we
did
next
morning
and
we
were
careful
to
be
till
the
ship
fly
which
contained
her
was
out
of
hearing
then
we
had
another
yelling
competition
and
noël
won
with
that
new
shriek
of
his
that
is
like
railway
engines
in
distress
and
then
we
went
and
fetched
bates
donkey
and
cart
and
packed
our
bales
in
it
and
started
some
riding
and
some
running
behind
any
faint
distant
traces
of
respectableness
that
were
left
to
our
clothes
were
soon
covered
up
by
the
dust
of
the
road
and
by
some
of
the
bursting
through
the
violence
of
the
cart
which
had
no
springs
the
first
farm
we
stopped
at
the
woman
really
did
want
some
pins
for
though
a
very
stupid
person
she
was
making
a
pink
blouse
and
we
said
do
have
some
tape
you
never
know
when
you
may
want
it
i
believe
in
buttons
she
said
no
strings
for
me
thank
you
but
when
oswald
said
what
about
you
ca
button
up
puddings
as
if
they
were
pillows
she
consented
to
listen
to
reason
but
it
was
only
twopence
altogether
but
at
the
next
place
the
woman
said
we
were
mummickers
and
told
us
to
get
along
do
and
she
set
her
dog
at
us
but
when
pincher
sprang
from
the
inmost
recesses
of
the
cart
she
called
her
dog
off
but
too
late
for
it
and
pincher
were
locked
in
the
barking
scuffling
growling
embrace
of
deadly
combat
when
we
had
separated
the
dogs
she
went
into
her
house
and
banged
the
door
and
we
went
on
through
the
green
flat
marshes
among
the
buttercups
and
i
wonder
what
she
meant
by
said
she
meant
she
saw
our
airs
through
our
shabby
clothes
said
alice
it
always
happening
especially
to
princes
there
nothing
so
hard
to
conceal
as
a
really
air
i
been
thinking
said
dicky
whether
honesty
would
perhaps
be
the
best
policy
not
always
of
course
but
just
this
once
if
people
knew
what
we
were
doing
it
for
they
might
be
glad
to
help
on
the
good
work
what
so
at
the
next
farm
which
was
half
hidden
by
trees
like
the
picture
at
the
beginning
of
sensible
susan
we
tied
the
pony
to
the
and
knocked
at
the
door
it
was
opened
by
a
man
this
time
and
dora
said
to
him
we
are
honest
traders
we
are
trying
to
sell
these
things
to
keep
a
lady
who
is
poor
if
you
buy
some
you
will
be
helping
too
would
you
like
to
do
that
it
is
a
good
work
and
you
will
be
glad
of
it
afterwards
when
you
come
to
think
over
the
acts
of
your
life
upon
my
word
an
said
the
man
whose
red
face
was
surrounded
by
a
frill
of
white
whiskers
if
ever
i
see
a
walkin
tract
it
stands
she
does
mean
to
be
tractish
said
oswald
quickly
it
only
her
way
but
we
really
are
trying
to
sell
things
to
help
a
poor
person
no
humbug
sir
so
if
we
got
anything
you
want
we
shall
be
glad
and
if
not
well
there
no
harm
in
asking
is
there
sir
the
man
with
the
frilly
whiskers
was
very
pleased
to
be
called
sir
oswald
knew
he
would
be
and
he
looked
at
everything
we
got
and
bought
the
and
two
and
a
pot
of
marmalade
and
a
ball
of
string
and
a
pair
of
braces
this
came
to
four
and
twopence
and
we
were
very
pleased
it
really
seemed
that
our
business
was
establishing
itself
root
and
branch
when
it
came
to
its
being
which
was
first
noticed
through
beginning
to
cry
and
say
he
did
not
want
to
play
any
more
it
was
found
that
we
had
forgotten
to
bring
any
dinner
so
we
had
to
eat
some
of
our
stock
the
jam
the
biscuits
and
the
cucumber
i
feel
a
new
man
said
alice
draining
the
last
of
the
bottles
at
that
homely
village
on
the
brow
of
yonder
hill
we
shall
sell
all
that
remains
of
the
stock
and
go
home
with
money
in
both
pockets
but
our
luck
had
changed
as
so
often
happens
our
hearts
beat
high
with
hopeful
thoughts
and
we
felt
jollier
than
we
had
done
all
day
merry
laughter
and
snatches
of
musical
song
from
our
cart
and
from
round
it
as
we
went
up
the
hill
all
nature
was
smiling
and
gay
there
was
nothing
sinister
in
the
look
of
the
trees
or
the
road
or
anything
dogs
are
said
to
have
inside
instincts
that
warn
them
of
intending
perils
but
pincher
was
not
a
bit
instinctive
that
day
somehow
he
sported
gaily
up
and
down
the
after
pretending
rats
and
once
he
was
so
excited
that
i
believe
he
was
playing
at
weasels
and
stoats
but
of
course
there
was
really
no
trace
of
these
savage
denizens
of
the
jungle
it
was
just
pincher
varied
imagination
we
got
to
the
village
and
with
joyful
expectations
we
knocked
at
the
first
door
we
came
to
alice
had
spread
out
a
few
choice
treasures
needles
pins
tape
a
and
the
butter
rather
soft
by
now
and
the
last
of
the
on
a
like
the
does
with
herrings
and
whitings
and
plums
and
apples
you
can
not
sell
fish
in
the
country
unless
you
sell
fruit
too
the
author
does
not
know
why
this
is
the
sun
was
shining
the
sky
was
blue
there
was
no
sign
at
all
of
the
intending
thunderbolt
not
even
when
the
door
was
opened
this
was
done
by
a
woman
she
just
looked
at
our
of
things
any
one
might
have
been
proud
to
buy
and
smiled
i
saw
her
do
it
then
she
turned
her
traitorous
head
and
called
jim
into
the
cottage
a
sleepy
grunt
rewarded
her
jim
i
say
she
repeated
come
here
directly
minute
next
moment
jim
appeared
he
was
jim
to
her
because
she
was
his
wife
i
suppose
but
to
us
he
was
the
police
with
his
hair
ruffled
from
his
hateful
no
doubt
and
his
tunic
unbuttoned
what
up
he
said
in
a
husky
voice
as
if
he
had
been
dreaming
that
he
had
a
cold
ca
a
chap
have
a
minute
to
himself
to
read
the
paper
in
you
told
me
to
said
the
woman
you
said
if
any
folks
come
to
the
door
with
things
i
was
to
call
you
whether
or
no
even
now
we
were
blind
to
the
disaster
that
was
entangling
us
in
the
meshes
of
its
trap
alice
said
we
sold
a
good
deal
but
we
things
left
very
nice
things
these
crochet
needles
but
the
police
who
had
buttoned
up
his
tunic
in
a
hurry
said
quite
fiercely
let
have
a
look
at
your
license
we
did
bring
any
said
noël
but
if
you
will
give
us
an
order
we
bring
you
some
he
thought
a
lisen
was
a
thing
to
sell
that
we
ought
to
have
thought
of
none
of
your
lip
was
the
unexpected
reply
of
the
now
plainly
brutal
constable
where
your
license
i
say
we
have
a
license
for
our
dog
but
father
got
it
said
oswald
always
but
not
this
time
quite
quick
enough
your
license
is
what
i
want
as
well
you
knows
you
young
limb
your
pedlar
license
your
license
to
sell
things
you
ai
half
so
as
you
want
to
make
out
we
have
got
a
pedlar
license
said
oswald
if
we
had
been
in
a
book
the
police
would
have
been
touched
to
tears
by
oswald
simple
honesty
he
would
have
said
noble
boy
and
then
gone
on
to
say
he
had
only
asked
the
question
to
test
our
honour
but
life
is
not
really
at
all
the
same
as
books
i
have
noticed
lots
of
differences
instead
of
behaving
like
the
this
constable
said
blowed
if
i
was
certain
of
it
well
my
young
blokes
you
just
come
along
o
me
to
sir
james
i
got
orders
to
bring
up
the
next
case
afore
him
said
dora
do
we
did
know
we
ought
to
we
only
wanted
ho
yes
said
the
constable
you
can
tell
all
that
to
the
magistrate
and
anything
you
say
will
be
used
against
you
i
sure
it
will
said
oswald
dora
do
lower
yourself
to
speak
to
him
come
we
go
home
the
police
was
combing
its
hair
with
a
piece
of
comb
and
we
turned
to
go
but
it
was
vain
ere
any
of
our
young
and
eager
legs
could
climb
into
the
cart
the
police
had
seized
the
donkey
bridle
we
could
not
desert
our
noble
steed
and
besides
it
was
really
ours
but
bates
and
this
made
any
hope
of
flight
quite
a
forlorn
one
for
better
for
worse
we
had
to
go
with
the
donkey
do
cry
for
goodness
sake
said
oswald
in
stern
undertones
bite
your
lips
take
long
breaths
do
let
him
see
we
mind
this
only
the
village
police
sir
james
will
be
a
gentleman
understand
do
disgrace
the
house
of
bastable
look
here
fall
into
line
no
indian
file
will
be
best
there
are
so
few
of
us
alice
if
you
snivel
i
never
say
you
ought
to
have
been
a
boy
again
shut
your
mouth
no
one
going
to
hurt
you
you
too
young
i
trying
said
alice
gasping
noël
oswald
went
on
now
as
so
often
showing
the
brilliant
qualities
of
the
born
leader
and
general
do
be
in
a
funk
remember
how
byron
fought
for
the
greeks
at
did
grouse
and
he
was
a
poet
like
you
now
look
here
let
be
dora
you
the
eldest
strike
up
any
tune
we
up
and
show
this
sneak
we
bastables
are
afraid
whoever
else
is
you
will
perhaps
find
it
difficult
to
believe
but
we
strike
up
we
sang
the
british
grenadiers
and
when
the
police
told
us
to
stow
it
we
did
not
and
noël
said
singing
is
dogs
or
pedlaring
you
do
want
a
license
for
that
i
soon
show
you
said
the
police
but
he
had
to
jolly
well
put
up
with
our
melodious
song
because
he
knew
that
there
is
really
any
law
to
prevent
you
singing
if
you
want
to
we
went
on
singing
it
soon
got
easier
than
at
first
and
we
followed
bates
donkey
and
cart
through
some
lodge
gates
and
up
a
drive
with
big
trees
and
we
came
out
in
front
of
a
big
white
house
and
there
was
a
lawn
we
stopped
singing
when
we
came
in
sight
of
the
house
and
got
ready
to
be
polite
to
sir
james
there
were
some
ladies
on
the
lawn
in
pretty
blue
and
green
dresses
this
cheered
us
ladies
are
seldom
quite
heartless
especially
when
young
the
police
drew
up
bates
donkey
opposite
the
big
front
door
with
pillars
and
rang
the
bell
our
hearts
were
beating
desperately
we
cast
glances
of
despair
at
the
ladies
then
quite
suddenly
alice
gave
a
yell
that
wild
indian
are
simply
nothing
to
and
tore
across
the
lawn
and
threw
her
arms
round
the
green
waist
of
one
of
the
ladies
oh
i
so
glad
she
cried
oh
save
us
we
have
done
anything
wrong
really
and
truly
we
have
and
then
we
all
saw
that
the
lady
was
our
own
red
house
that
we
liked
so
much
so
we
all
rushed
to
her
and
before
that
police
had
got
the
door
answered
we
had
told
her
our
tale
the
other
ladies
had
turned
away
when
we
approached
her
and
gone
politely
away
into
a
shrubbery
there
there
she
said
patting
alice
and
noël
and
as
much
of
the
others
as
she
could
get
hold
of
do
you
worry
dears
do
make
it
all
right
with
sir
james
let
all
sit
down
in
a
comfy
heap
and
get
our
breaths
again
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
all
my
husband
met
your
father
at
lunch
the
other
day
i
meant
to
come
over
and
see
you
you
can
not
imagine
the
feelings
of
joy
and
safeness
that
we
felt
now
we
had
found
someone
who
knew
we
were
bastables
and
not
vagrant
outcasts
like
the
police
thought
the
door
had
now
been
answered
we
saw
the
base
police
talking
to
the
person
who
answered
it
then
he
came
towards
us
very
red
in
the
face
leave
off
bothering
the
lady
he
said
and
come
along
of
me
sir
james
is
in
his
and
he
ready
to
do
justice
on
you
so
he
is
red
house
jumped
up
and
so
did
we
she
said
with
smiles
as
if
nothing
was
wrong
good
morning
inspector
he
looked
pleased
and
surprised
as
well
he
might
for
it
be
long
enough
before
he
within
a
mile
of
being
good
morning
miss
i
sure
he
replied
i
think
there
been
a
little
mistake
inspector
she
said
i
expect
it
some
of
your
men
led
away
by
zeal
for
their
duties
but
i
sure
understand
i
am
staying
with
lady
harborough
and
these
children
are
very
dear
friends
of
mine
the
police
looked
very
silly
but
he
said
something
about
hawking
without
a
license
oh
no
not
said
red
house
not
surely
they
were
just
at
it
you
know
your
subordinates
must
have
been
quite
mistaken
our
honesty
bade
us
say
that
he
was
his
own
only
subordinate
and
that
he
had
been
mistaken
but
it
is
rude
to
interrupt
especially
a
lady
so
we
said
nothing
the
police
said
firmly
you
excuse
me
miss
but
sir
james
expressly
told
me
to
lay
a
information
directly
next
time
i
caught
any
of
at
it
without
a
license
but
you
see
you
did
catch
them
at
it
red
house
took
some
money
out
of
her
purse
you
might
just
give
this
to
your
subordinates
to
console
them
for
the
mistake
they
made
and
look
here
these
mistakes
do
lead
to
trouble
sometimes
so
i
tell
you
what
i
do
i
promise
not
to
tell
sir
james
a
word
about
it
nobody
will
be
blamed
we
listened
breathless
for
his
reply
he
put
his
hands
behind
him
well
miss
he
said
at
last
you
managed
to
put
the
force
in
the
wrong
somehow
which
is
often
done
and
i
blest
if
i
know
how
you
make
it
out
but
there
sir
james
for
me
to
come
before
him
with
my
complaint
what
am
i
to
say
to
him
oh
anything
said
red
house
surely
some
one
else
has
done
something
wrong
that
you
can
tell
him
about
there
was
a
matter
of
a
couple
of
snares
and
some
night
lines
he
said
slowly
drawing
nearer
to
red
house
but
i
could
take
no
money
of
course
of
course
not
she
said
i
beg
your
pardon
for
offering
it
but
give
you
my
name
and
address
and
if
ever
i
can
be
of
any
use
to
you
she
turned
her
back
on
us
while
she
wrote
it
down
with
a
stumpy
pencil
he
lent
her
but
oswald
could
swear
that
he
heard
money
chink
and
that
there
was
something
large
and
round
wrapped
up
in
the
paper
she
gave
him
sorry
for
any
little
misunderstanding
the
police
now
said
feeling
the
paper
with
his
fingers
and
my
respects
to
you
miss
and
your
young
friends
i
best
be
going
and
he
went
to
sir
james
i
suppose
he
seemed
quite
tamed
i
hope
the
people
who
set
the
snares
got
off
so
all
right
said
red
house
oh
you
dear
children
you
must
stay
to
lunch
and
we
have
a
splendid
time
what
a
darling
princess
you
are
noël
said
slowly
you
are
a
witch
princess
too
with
magic
powers
over
the
police
it
not
a
very
pretty
sort
of
magic
she
said
and
she
sighed
everything
about
you
is
pretty
said
noël
and
i
could
see
him
beginning
to
make
the
faces
that
always
precur
his
but
before
the
fit
could
break
out
thoroughly
the
rest
of
us
awoke
from
our
stupor
of
grateful
safeness
and
began
to
dance
round
red
house
in
a
ring
and
the
girls
sang
the
rose
is
red
the
violet
blue
carnation
sweet
and
so
are
you
over
and
over
again
so
we
had
to
join
in
though
i
think
she
a
jolly
good
fellow
would
have
been
more
manly
and
less
like
a
poetry
book
suddenly
a
known
voice
broke
in
on
our
singing
it
said
and
we
stopped
dancing
and
there
were
the
other
two
ladies
who
had
politely
walked
off
when
we
first
discovered
red
house
and
one
of
them
was
bax
of
all
people
in
the
world
and
she
was
smoking
a
cigarette
so
now
we
knew
where
the
smell
of
tobacco
came
from
in
the
white
house
we
said
in
one
breath
and
were
silent
is
it
possible
said
bax
that
these
are
the
children
i
been
living
with
these
three
long
days
we
sorry
said
dora
softly
we
would
have
made
a
noise
if
know
you
were
here
so
i
suppose
said
bax
chloe
you
seem
to
be
a
witch
how
have
you
galvanised
my
six
rag
dolls
into
life
like
this
rag
dolls
said
before
we
could
stop
him
i
think
you
jolly
mean
and
ungrateful
and
it
was
sixpence
for
making
the
organs
fly
my
brain
reeling
said
bax
putting
her
hands
to
her
head
is
very
rude
and
i
am
sorry
said
alice
but
it
hard
to
be
called
rag
dolls
when
you
only
tried
to
do
as
you
were
told
and
then
in
answer
to
red
house
questions
we
told
how
father
had
begged
us
to
be
quiet
and
how
we
had
earnestly
tried
to
when
it
was
told
bax
began
to
laugh
and
so
did
red
house
and
at
last
bax
said
oh
my
dears
you
do
know
how
glad
i
am
that
you
really
alive
i
began
to
think
oh
i
do
know
what
i
thought
and
you
not
rag
dolls
you
heroes
and
heroines
every
man
jack
of
you
and
i
do
thank
you
but
i
never
wanted
to
be
quiet
like
i
just
did
want
to
be
bothered
with
london
and
tiresome
people
and
now
enjoy
ourselves
shall
it
be
rounders
or
stories
about
cannibals
rounders
first
and
stories
after
said
and
it
was
so
bax
now
that
her
true
nature
was
revealed
proved
to
be
the
author
does
not
ask
for
a
jollier
person
to
be
in
the
house
with
we
had
rare
larks
the
whole
time
she
stayed
with
us
and
to
think
that
we
might
never
have
known
her
true
character
if
she
had
been
an
old
school
friend
of
red
house
and
if
red
house
had
been
such
a
friend
of
ours
friendship
as
william
smith
so
truly
says
in
his
book
about
latin
is
the
crown
of
life
poor
and
what
shall
we
do
kiddies
said
bax
we
had
discovered
her
true
nature
but
three
days
ago
and
already
she
had
taken
us
out
in
a
and
in
a
motor
car
had
given
us
sweets
every
day
and
taught
us
eleven
new
games
that
we
had
not
known
before
and
only
four
of
the
new
games
were
rotters
how
seldom
can
as
much
be
said
for
the
games
of
a
however
gifted
the
day
was
one
of
cloudless
blue
perfectness
and
we
were
all
basking
on
the
beach
we
had
all
bathed
bax
said
we
might
there
are
points
about
having
a
with
you
if
it
is
the
right
kind
you
can
then
easily
get
it
to
say
yes
to
what
you
want
and
after
that
if
anything
goes
wrong
it
is
their
fault
and
you
are
pure
from
blame
but
nothing
had
gone
wrong
with
the
bathe
and
so
far
we
were
all
alive
and
not
cold
at
all
except
our
fingers
and
feet
what
would
you
to
do
asked
bax
we
were
far
away
from
human
sight
along
the
beach
and
bax
was
smoking
cigarettes
as
usual
i
do
know
we
all
said
politely
but
said
what
about
poor
miss
sandal
why
poor
asked
bax
because
she
is
said
but
how
what
do
you
mean
asked
bax
why
is
she
said
is
she
what
said
bax
what
you
said
why
about
said
she
put
her
hands
to
her
head
her
short
hair
was
still
damp
and
rumpled
from
contact
with
the
foaming
billows
of
ocean
let
have
a
fresh
deal
and
start
fair
she
said
why
do
you
think
my
sister
is
poor
i
forgot
she
was
your
sister
said
or
i
would
have
said
it
honour
bright
i
would
do
mention
it
said
bax
and
began
throwing
stones
at
a
groin
in
amiable
silence
we
were
furious
with
first
because
it
is
such
bad
manners
to
throw
people
poverty
in
their
faces
or
even
in
their
sisters
faces
like
had
just
done
and
second
because
it
seemed
to
have
put
out
of
bax
head
what
she
was
beginning
to
say
about
what
would
we
like
to
do
so
oswald
presently
remarked
when
he
had
aimed
at
the
stump
she
was
aiming
at
and
hit
it
before
she
did
for
though
a
fair
shot
for
a
lady
she
takes
a
long
time
to
get
her
eye
in
bax
we
should
like
to
do
whatever
like
to
do
this
was
real
politeness
and
true
too
as
it
happened
because
by
this
time
we
could
quite
trust
her
not
to
want
to
do
anything
deeply
duffing
that
very
nice
of
you
she
replied
but
do
let
me
interfere
with
any
plans
of
yours
my
own
idea
was
to
pluck
a
waggonette
from
the
nearest
bush
i
suppose
they
grow
freely
in
these
parts
there
one
at
the
said
alice
it
costs
to
pluck
it
just
for
going
to
the
station
well
then
and
to
stuff
our
waggonette
with
lunch
and
drive
over
to
lynwood
castle
and
eat
it
there
a
picnic
fell
in
accents
of
joy
from
the
lips
of
one
and
all
we
also
boil
the
billy
in
the
castle
courtyard
and
eat
buns
in
the
shadow
of
the
keep
tea
as
well
said
with
buns
you
ca
be
poor
and
needy
any
way
whatever
your
we
hastily
hushed
him
stifling
his
murmurs
with
sand
i
always
think
said
bax
dreamily
that
more
the
merrier
is
peculiarly
true
of
picnics
so
i
have
arranged
always
subject
to
your
approval
of
course
to
meet
your
friends
and
red
house
there
and
we
drowned
her
conclusive
remarks
with
a
cheer
and
oswald
always
willing
to
be
of
use
offered
to
go
to
the
and
see
about
the
waggonette
i
like
horses
and
and
the
smell
of
hay
and
straw
and
talking
to
ostlers
and
people
like
that
there
turned
out
to
be
two
horses
belonging
to
the
best
waggonette
or
you
could
have
a
one
much
smaller
with
the
blue
cloth
of
the
cushions
rather
frayed
and
mended
here
and
there
and
green
in
patches
from
age
and
exposition
to
the
weather
oswald
told
bax
this
not
concealing
about
how
shabby
the
little
one
was
and
she
gloriously
said
the
pair
by
all
means
we
do
kill
a
pig
every
day
no
indeed
said
dora
but
if
killing
a
pig
means
having
a
lark
bax
is
as
good
a
as
any
i
ever
knew
it
was
splendid
to
drive
oswald
on
the
box
beside
the
driver
who
had
his
best
coat
with
the
bright
buttons
along
the
same
roads
that
we
had
trodden
as
muddy
pedestrinators
or
travelled
along
behind
donkey
it
was
a
perfect
day
as
i
said
before
we
were
all
clean
and
had
our
things
on
i
think
are
much
more
comfy
than
you
feel
equivalent
to
meeting
any
one
and
have
a
heart
for
any
fate
as
it
says
in
the
and
yet
you
are
not
starched
and
booted
and
stiffened
and
tightened
out
of
all
human
feelings
lynwood
castle
is
in
a
hollow
in
the
hills
it
has
a
moat
all
round
it
with
leaves
on
it
i
suppose
there
are
lilies
when
in
season
there
is
a
bridge
over
the
moat
not
the
draw
kind
of
bridge
and
the
castle
has
eight
towers
four
round
and
four
square
ones
and
a
courtyard
in
the
middle
all
green
grass
and
heaps
of
stones
stray
bits
of
castle
i
suppose
they
are
and
a
great
white
in
the
middle
that
bax
said
was
hundreds
of
years
old
red
house
was
sitting
under
the
when
we
got
there
nursing
her
baby
in
a
blue
dress
and
looking
exactly
like
a
picture
on
the
top
of
a
the
girls
instantly
wanted
to
nurse
the
baby
so
we
let
them
and
we
explored
the
castle
we
had
never
happened
to
explore
one
thoroughly
before
we
did
not
find
the
deepest
dungeon
below
the
castle
moat
though
we
looked
everywhere
for
it
but
we
found
everything
else
you
can
think
of
belonging
to
castles
even
the
holes
they
used
to
pour
boiling
lead
through
into
the
eyes
of
besiegers
when
they
tried
to
squint
up
to
see
how
strong
the
garrison
was
in
the
keep
and
the
little
slits
they
shot
arrows
through
and
the
mouldering
remains
of
the
portcullis
we
went
up
the
eight
towers
every
single
one
of
them
and
some
parts
were
jolly
dangerous
i
can
tell
you
dicky
and
i
would
not
let
and
noël
come
up
the
dangerous
parts
there
was
no
lasting
about
this
by
the
time
we
had
had
a
thorough
good
explore
lunch
was
ready
it
was
a
glorious
lunch
not
too
many
meaty
things
but
all
sorts
of
cakes
and
sweets
and
grapes
and
figs
and
nuts
we
gazed
at
the
feast
and
bax
said
there
you
are
young
copperfield
and
a
royal
spread
you
got
had
currant
wine
said
noël
who
has
only
just
read
the
book
by
charles
dickens
well
so
have
you
said
bax
and
we
had
two
bottles
of
it
i
never
knew
any
one
like
you
said
noël
to
red
house
dreamily
with
his
mouth
full
for
knowing
the
things
people
really
like
to
eat
not
the
things
that
are
good
for
them
but
what
they
and
bax
is
just
the
same
it
was
one
of
the
things
they
taught
at
our
school
said
bax
do
you
remember
the
saturday
night
feasts
chloe
and
how
good
the
cocoanut
ice
tasted
after
extra
strong
peppermints
fancy
you
knowing
said
i
thought
it
was
us
found
out
i
really
know
much
more
about
things
to
eat
than
does
said
bax
i
was
quite
an
old
girl
when
she
was
a
little
thing
in
pinafores
she
was
such
a
nice
little
girl
i
should
wonder
if
she
was
always
nice
said
noël
even
when
she
was
a
baby
everybody
laughed
at
this
except
the
existing
baby
and
it
was
asleep
on
the
waggonette
cushions
under
the
white
and
perhaps
if
it
had
been
awake
it
would
have
laughed
for
oswald
himself
though
possessing
a
keen
sense
of
humour
did
not
see
anything
to
laugh
at
red
house
made
a
speech
after
dinner
and
said
drink
to
the
health
of
everybody
one
after
the
other
in
currant
wine
which
was
done
beginning
with
bax
and
ending
with
then
he
said
somnus
avaunt
what
shall
we
play
at
and
nobody
as
so
often
happens
had
any
idea
ready
then
suddenly
red
house
said
good
gracious
look
there
and
we
looked
there
and
where
we
were
to
look
was
the
lowest
piece
of
the
castle
wall
just
beside
the
keep
that
the
bridge
led
over
to
and
what
we
were
to
look
at
was
a
strange
blobbiness
of
knobbly
bumps
along
the
top
that
looked
exactly
like
human
heads
it
turned
out
when
we
had
talked
about
cannibals
and
new
guinea
that
human
heads
were
just
exactly
what
they
were
not
loose
heads
stuck
on
pikes
or
things
like
that
such
as
there
often
must
have
been
while
the
castle
stayed
in
the
olden
times
it
was
built
in
and
belonged
to
but
real
live
heads
with
their
bodies
still
in
attendance
on
them
they
were
in
fact
the
village
children
poor
little
lazaruses
said
red
house
there
not
such
a
bad
slice
of
dives
feast
left
said
bax
shall
we
so
red
house
went
out
by
the
keep
and
called
the
heads
in
with
the
bodies
they
were
connected
with
of
course
and
they
came
and
ate
up
all
that
was
left
of
the
lunch
not
the
buns
of
course
for
those
were
sacred
to
but
all
the
other
things
even
the
nuts
and
figs
and
we
were
quite
glad
that
they
should
have
them
really
and
truly
we
were
even
they
did
not
seem
to
be
very
clever
children
or
just
the
sort
you
would
choose
for
your
friends
but
i
suppose
you
like
to
play
however
little
you
are
other
people
sort
so
after
they
had
eaten
all
there
was
when
red
house
invited
them
all
to
join
in
games
with
us
we
knew
we
ought
to
be
pleased
but
village
children
are
not
taught
rounders
and
though
we
wondered
at
first
why
their
teachers
had
not
seen
to
this
we
understood
presently
because
it
is
most
awfully
difficult
to
make
them
understand
the
very
simplest
thing
but
they
could
play
all
the
ring
games
and
nuts
and
may
and
there
came
three
knights
and
another
one
we
had
never
heard
of
before
the
singing
part
begins
up
and
down
the
green
grass
this
and
that
and
thus
come
along
my
pretty
maid
and
take
a
walk
with
us
you
shall
have
a
duck
my
dear
and
you
shall
have
a
drake
and
you
shall
have
a
handsome
man
for
your
father
sake
i
forget
the
rest
and
if
anybody
who
reads
this
knows
it
and
will
write
and
tell
me
the
author
will
not
have
laboured
in
vain
the
played
with
all
their
heart
and
soul
i
expect
it
is
but
seldom
they
are
able
to
play
and
they
enjoy
the
novel
excitement
and
when
we
been
at
it
some
time
we
saw
there
was
another
head
looking
over
the
wall
hullo
said
bax
here
another
of
them
run
along
and
ask
it
to
come
and
join
in
she
spoke
to
the
village
children
but
nobody
ran
here
you
go
she
said
pointing
at
a
girl
in
red
plaits
tied
with
dirty
ribbon
please
miss
i
leifer
not
replied
the
mother
says
we
ai
to
play
along
of
him
why
what
the
matter
with
him
asked
red
house
his
father
in
jail
miss
along
of
snares
and
night
lines
and
no
one
wo
give
his
mother
any
work
so
my
mother
says
we
ai
to

she
added
in
low
tones

heard
by
the

and
red

but
red
house
said
in
a
whisper
that
no
one
overheard
except
and
the
present
author
do
it
no
good
the
poor
little
pariah
would
like
it
and
these
kids
only
do
what
their
parents
teach
them
if
the

did

would
think
he
heard
him
mutter
a
word
that
gentlemen
would

detachment

consolation
red
house
went
on
look
here
kids
who
go
and
talk
to
the
poor
little
chap
we
all
instantly
said
will
the
present
author
was
chosen
to
be
the
one
when
you
think
about
yourself
there
is
a
kind
of
you
that
is
not
what
you
generally
are
but
that
you
know
you
would
like
to
be
if
only
you
were
good
enough
albert
uncle
says
this
is
called
your
ideal
of
yourself
i
will
call
it
your
best
i
for
short
oswald
best
i
was
glad
to
go
and
talk
to
that
boy
whose
father
was
in
prison
but
the
oswald
that
generally
exists
hated
being
out
of
the
games
yet
the
whole
oswald
both
the
best
and
the
ordinary
was
pleased
that
he
was
the
one
chosen
to
be
a
detachment
of
consolation
he
went
out
under
the
great
archway
and
as
he
went
he
heard
the
games
beginning
again
this
made
him
feel
noble
and
yet
he
was
ashamed
of
feeling
it
your
feelings
are
a
beastly
nuisance
if
once
you
begin
to
let
yourself
think
about
them
oswald
soon
saw
the
broken
boots
of
the
boy
whose
father
was
in
jail
so
nobody
would
play
with
him
standing
on
the
stones
near
the
top
of
the
wall
where
it
was
broken
to
match
the
boots
he
climbed
up
and
said
hullo
to
this
remark
the
boy
replied
hullo
oswald
now
did
not
know
what
to
say
the
sorrier
you
are
for
people
the
harder
it
is
to
tell
them
so
but
at
last
he
said
i
just
heard
about
your
father
being
where
he
is
it
beastly
rough
luck
i
hope
you
do
mind
my
saying
i
jolly
sorry
for
you
the
boy
had
a
pale
face
and
watery
blue
eyes
when
oswald
said
this
his
eyes
got
waterier
than
ever
and
he
climbed
down
to
the
ground
before
he
said
i
do
care
so
much
but
it
do
upset
mother
something
crool
it
is
awfully
difficult
to
console
those
in
affliction
oswald
thought
this
then
he
said
i
say
never
mind
if
those
beastly
kids
wo
play
with
you
it
your
fault
you
know
nor
it
ai
father
neither
the
boy
said
he
broke
his
arm
off
of
a
rick
and
he
had
paid
up
his
club
money
along
of
mother
new
baby
costing
what
it
did
when
it
come
so
there
nothing
and
what
a
hare
or
two
or
a
partridge
it
ai
as
if
it
was
pheasants
as
is
as
dear
to
rear
as
chicks
oswald
did
not
know
what
to
say
so
he
got
out
his
new
and
said
look
here
you
can
have
this
to
keep
if
you
like
the
boy
took
it
and
looked
at
it
and
said
you
ai
foolin
me
and
oswald
said
no
he
was
but
he
felt
most
awfully
rum
and
uncomfy
and
though
he
wanted
most
frightfully
to
do
something
for
the
boy
he
felt
as
if
he
wanted
to
get
away
more
than
anything
else
and
he
never
was
gladder
in
his
life
than
when
he
saw
dora
coming
along
and
she
said
you
go
back
and
play
oswald
i
tired
and
i
like
to
sit
down
a
bit
she
got
the
boy
to
sit
down
beside
her
and
oswald
went
back
to
the
others
games
however
unusually
splendid
have
to
come
to
an
end
and
when
the
games
were
over
and
it
was
tea
and
the
village
children
were
sent
away
and
oswald
went
to
call
dora
and
the
prisoner
son
he
found
nothing
but
dora
and
he
saw
at
once
in
his
way
that
she
had
been
crying
it
was
one
of
the
days
we
ever
had
and
the
drive
home
was
good
but
dora
was
horribly
quiet
as
though
the
victim
of
dark
interior
thoughts
and
the
next
day
she
was
but
little
better
we
were
all
paddling
on
the
sands
but
dora
would
not
and
presently
alice
left
us
and
went
back
to
dora
and
we
all
saw
across
the
sandy
waste
that
something
was
up
and
presently
alice
came
down
and
said
dry
your
feet
and
legs
and
come
to
a
council
dora
wants
to
tell
you
something
we
dried
our
pink
and
sandy
toes
and
we
came
to
the
council
then
alice
said
i
do
think
is
wanted
at
the
council
it
is
anything
amusing
you
go
and
enjoy
yourself
by
the
sea
and
catch
the
nice
little
crabs
dear
said
you
always
want
me
to
be
out
of
everything
i
can
be
councils
as
well
as
anybody
else
oh
said
alice
in
pleading
tones
not
if
i
give
you
a
halfpenny
to
go
and
buy
with
so
then
he
went
and
dora
said
i
ca
think
how
i
could
do
it
when
you
all
trusted
me
so
and
yet
i
could
help
it
i
remember
dicky
saying
when
you
decided
to
give
it
me
to
take
care
of
about
me
being
the
most
trustworthy
of
all
of
us
not
fit
for
any
one
to
speak
to
but
it
did
seem
the
really
right
thing
at
the
time
it
really
and
truly
did
and
now
it
all
looks
different
what
has
she
done
dicky
asked
this
but
oswald
almost
knew
tell
them
said
dora
turning
over
on
her
front
and
hiding
her
face
partly
in
her
hands
and
partly
in
the
sand
she
given
all
miss
sandal
money
to
that
little
boy
that
the
father
of
was
in
prison
said
alice
it
was
one
pound
thirteen
and
sevenpence
halfpenny
sobbed
dora
you
ought
to
have
consulted
us
i
do
think
really
said
dicky
of
course
i
see
you
sorry
now
but
i
do
think
that
how
could
i
consult
you
said
dora
you
were
all
playing
cat
and
mouse
and
he
wanted
to
get
home
i
only
wish
you
heard
what
he
told
me
that
all
about
his
mother
being
ill
and
nobody
letting
her
do
any
work
because
of
where
his
father
is
and
his
baby
brother
ill
poor
little
darling
and
not
enough
to
eat
and
everything
as
awful
as
you
can
possibly
think
i
save
up
and
pay
it
all
back
out
of
my
own
money
only
do
forgive
me
all
of
you
and
say
you
do
despise
me
for
a
forger
and
embezzlementer
i
could
help
it
i
glad
you
could
said
the
sudden
voice
of
who
had
sneaked
up
on
his
young
stomach
unobserved
by
the
council
you
shall
have
all
my
money
too
dora
and
here
the
halfpenny
to
begin
with
he
crammed
it
into
her
hand
listen
i
should
jolly
well
think
i
did
listen
went
on
i
just
as
much
right
as
anybody
else
to
be
in
at
a
council
and
i
think
dora
was
quite
right
and
the
rest
of
you
are
beasts
not
to
say
so
too
when
you
see
how
she
blubbing
suppose
it
had
been
darling
ill
and
nobody
had
given
you
nothing
when
they
got
pounds
and
pounds
in
their
silly
pockets
he
now
hugged
dora
who
responded
it
was
her
own
money
said
dicky
if
you
think
our
darling
said
oswald
but
alice
and
noël
began
hugging
dora
and
and
dicky
and
i
felt
it
was
no
go
girls
have
no
right
and
honourable
feelings
about
business
and
little
boys
are
the
same
all
right
said
oswald
rather
bitterly
if
a
majority
of
the
council
backs
dora
up
we
give
in
but
we
must
all
save
up
and
repay
the
money
that
all
we
shall
all
be
beastly
short
for
ages
oh
said
dora
and
now
her
sobs
were
beginning
to
turn
into
sniffs
you
do
know
how
i
felt
and
i
felt
most
awful
ever
since
but
those
poor
poor
people
at
this
moment
bax
came
down
on
to
the
beach
by
the
wooden
steps
that
lead
from
the
where
the
grass
grows
between
the
stones
hullo
she
said
hurt
yourself
my
dora
was
rather
a
favourite
of
hers
it
all
right
now
said
dora
all
right
said
bax
who
has
learnt
in
climes
the
great
art
of
not
asking
too
many
questions
red
house
has
come
to
lunch
she
went
this
morning
to
see
that
boy
mother
you
know
the
boy
the
others
would
play
with
we
said
yes
well
red
house
has
arranged
to
get
the
woman
some
work
like
the
dear
she
is
the
woman
told
her
that
the
little
lady
and
that
you
dora
had
given
the
little
boy
one
pound
thirteen
and
sevenpence
bax
looked
straight
out
to
sea
through
her
spectacles
and
went
on
that
must
have
been
about
all
you
had
among
the
lot
of
you
i
want
to
jaw
but
i
think
you
a
set
of
little
bricks
and
i
must
say
so
or
expire
on
the
sandy
spot
there
was
a
painful
silence
looked
there
what
did
i
tell
you
at
the
rest
of
us
then
alice
said
we
others
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
it
was
doing
i
suppose
she
said
this
because
we
did
not
mean
to
tell
bax
anything
about
it
and
if
there
was
any
brickiness
in
the
act
we
wished
dora
to
have
the
consolement
of
getting
the
credit
of
it
but
of
course
dora
could
stand
that
she
said
oh
bax
it
was
very
wrong
of
me
it
was
my
own
money
and
no
business
to
but
i
was
so
sorry
for
the
little
boy
and
his
mother
and
his
darling
the
money
belonged
to
some
one
else
who
bax
asked
ere
she
had
time
to
remember
the
excellent
australian
rule
about
not
asking
questions
and
blurted
out
it
was
miss
sandal
money
every
penny
before
we
could
stop
him
once
again
in
our
career
concealment
was
at
an
end
the
rule
about
questions
was
again
unregarded
and
the
whole
thing
came
out
it
was
a
long
story
and
red
house
came
out
in
the
middle
but
nobody
could
mind
her
hearing
things
when
she
knew
all
from
the
plain
living
to
the
pedlar
who
had
a
license
bax
spoke
up
like
a
man
and
said
several
kind
things
that
i
wo
write
down
she
then
went
on
to
say
that
her
sister
was
not
poor
and
needy
at
all
but
that
she
lived
plain
and
thought
high
just
because
she
liked
it
we
were
very
disappointed
as
soon
as
we
had
got
over
our
hardly
believing
any
one
could
like
it
i
mean
and
then
red
house
said
sir
james
gave
me
five
pounds
for
the
poor
woman
and
she
sent
back
thirty
of
your
shillings
she
had
spent
three
and
sevenpence
and
they
had
a
lovely
supper
of
boiled
pork
and
greens
last
night
so
now
only
got
that
to
make
up
and
you
can
buy
a
most
splendid
present
for
miss
sandal
it
is
difficult
to
choose
presents
for
people
who
live
plain
and
think
high
because
they
like
it
but
at
last
we
decided
to
get
books
they
were
written
by
a
person
called
emerson
and
of
a
dull
character
but
the
backs
were
very
beautiful
and
miss
sandal
was
most
awfully
pleased
with
them
when
she
came
down
to
her
cottage
with
her
partially
repaired
brother
who
had
fallen
off
the
scaffold
when
treating
a
bricklayer
to
tracts
this
is
the
end
of
the
things
we
did
when
we
were
at
lymchurch
in
miss
sandal
house
it
is
the
last
story
that
the
present
author
means
ever
to
be
the
author
of
so
