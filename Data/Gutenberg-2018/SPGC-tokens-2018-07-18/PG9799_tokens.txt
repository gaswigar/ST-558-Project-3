the

it
happened
in

chapter
i
the
secret
and
the
girl
the
exciting
part
began
in
cairo
but
perhaps
i
ought
to
go
back
to
what
happened
on
the
between
naples
and
alexandria
luckily
no
one
can
expect
a
man
who
actually
rejoices
in
his
nickname
of
duffer
to
know
how
or
where
a
true
story
should
begin
the
huge
ship
was
passing
swiftly
out
of
the
bay
of
naples
and
already
we
were
in
the
strait
between
capri
and
the
mainland
i
had
come
on
deck
from
the
for
a
last
look
at
poor
vesuvius
who
lost
her
lovely
head
in
the
last
eruption
i
paced
up
and
down
acutely
conscious
of
my
great
secret
the
secret
inspiring
my
voyage
to
egypt
for
months
it
had
been
the
hidden
romance
of
life
now
it
began
to
seem
real
this
is
not
the
moment
to
tell
how
i
got
the
papers
that
revealed
the
secret
before
i
passed
them
on
to
anthony
fenton
at
khartum
for
him
to
say
whether
or
not
the
notes
were
of
real
importance
but
the
papers
had
been
left
in
rome
by
ferlini
the
italian
egyptologist
seventy
years
ago
when
he
gave
to
the
museum
at
berlin
the
treasures
he
had
unearthed
it
was
ferlini
who
ransacked
the
pyramids
all
about
meroë
that
island
in
the
desert
where
in
its
days
of
splendour
reigned
the
queens
candace
fenton
stationed
at
khartum
an
eager
dabbler
in
the
old
lore
of
egypt
sent
me
an
enthusiastic
telegram
the
moment
he
read
the
documents
they
confirmed
legends
of
the
sudan
in
which
he
had
been
interested
putting
two
and
two
together
the
legends
and
ferlini
notes
anthony
was
convinced
that
we
had
the
clue
to
fortune
at
once
he
applied
for
permission
to
excavate
under
the
little
outlying
mountain
named
by
the
desert
folk
the
mountain
of
the
golden
pyramid
at
first
the
spot
was
thought
to
fall
within
the
province
given
up
to
garstang
digging
for
liverpool
university
later
however
the
des
pronounced
the
place
to
be
outside
garstang
borders
and
it
seemed
that
luck
was
coming
our
way
no
one
but
we
two
fenton
and
i
had
any
inkling
of
what
might
lie
hidden
in
the
mountain
of
the
golden
pyramid
that
was
the
great
secret
then
fenton
had
gone
to
the
balkans
on
a
flying
trip
in
every
sense
of
the
word
it
was
only
a
fortnight
ago
i
being
then
in
rome
that
i
had
had
a
wire
from
him
in
salonica
saying
friends
at
work
to
promote
our
scheme
meet
me
on
my
return
to
egypt
after
that
several
telegrams
had
been
exchanged
and
here
i
was
on
the
bound
for
the
land
of
my
birth
full
of
hope
and
dreams
for
some
moments
distant
vesuvius
had
beguiled
my
thoughts
from
the
still
more
distant
mountain
of
the
secret
when
suddenly
a
white
girl
in
a
white
hood
and
a
long
white
cloak
passed
me
on
the
white
deck
whereupon
i
forgot
mountains
of
reality
and
dreams
she
was
one
of
those
tall
slim
of
girls
they
are
running
up
nowadays
in
england
and
america
with
much
success
and
besides
all
that
she
was
an
amazing
symphony
in
white
and
gold
against
an
azure
italian
sea
and
sky
the
two
last
being
breezily
jumbled
together
at
the
moment
for
us
on
shipboard
she
walked
well
in
spite
of
the
blue
turmoil
and
if
a
fair
girl
with
hair
gets
herself
up
in
satiny
white
fur
from
head
to
foot
she
is
evidently
meant
to
be
looked
at
others
were
looking
also
they
were
whispering
after
she
went
by
and
her
serene
air
of
being
alone
in
a
world
made
entirely
for
her
caused
me
to
wonder
if
she
were
not
some
one
in
particular
just
then
a
sweet
soft
voice
said
close
to
my
ear
why
duffer
dear
it
ca
possibly
be
you
i
gave
a
jump
for
i
had
heard
that
voice
for
many
a
year
and
between
the
ages
of
four
and
fourteen
i
had
been
in
love
with
it
brigit
said
i
then
i
grabbed
her
two
hands
and
shook
them
as
if
her
arms
had
been
branches
of
a
young
cherry
tree
dropping
fruit
why
not
biddy
she
asked
or
are
ye
wanting
me
to
call
ye
lord
ernest
good
heavens
no
once
a
duffer
always
a
duffer
i
assured
her
and
i
been
thinking
of
you
as
biddy
from
then
till
now
only
was
as
clever
a
thing
as
a
boy
ever
did
she
broke
in
with
one
of
her
smiles
that
no
man
ever
forgets
to
begin
duffing
at
an
early
age
in
order
to
escape
all
the
professions
and
businesses
your
pastors
and
masters
proposed
and
go
your
own
way
are
ye
at
it
still
rather
but
you
i
want
to
talk
to
you
then
do
do
it
in
a
loud
voice
if
you
please
because
as
you
must
have
realized
if
you
taken
time
to
think
i
jones
at
present
why
jones
because
smith
is
engaged
beforehand
by
too
many
people
honestly
without
joking
i
in
danger
here
and
everywhere
and
it
a
wicked
selfish
thing
for
me
to
come
the
way
i
have
but
rosamond
gilder
is
the
hardest
girl
to
resist
you
ever
saw
so
i
with
her
and
it
a
long
history
rosamond
gilder
what
the
cannon
princess
the
bertha
krupp
of
america
yes
the
babe
that
used
to
be
wheeled
about
in
a
caged
perambulator
guarded
by
detectives
the
bud
whose
coming
out
in
society
was
called
the
million
dollar
début
now
she
just
had
her
birthday
and
the
sunday
supplements
have
promoted
her
to
be
the
golden
girl
alternating
with
the
gilded
rose
although
the
simplest
creature
really
with
a
tremendous
sense
of
the
responsibility
of
her
riches
poor
child
there
she
is
walking
toward
us
now
with
those
two
young
men
of
course
young
men
droves
of
young
men
she
ca
get
away
from
them
any
more
than
she
can
from
her
money
no
she
stopped
to
talk
to
cleopatra
that
tall
white
girl
rosamond
gilder
just
before
you
came
i
was
wondering
who
she
was
and
when
you
smiled
at
each
other
across
the
deck
it
sprang
into
my
mind
that
that
that
what
oh
it
seems
stupid
now
give
me
a
chance
to
judge
dear
duffer
well
seeing
you
and
knowing
that
is
it
occurred
to
me
you
might
be
travelling
with
the
daughter
of
your
late
good
heavens
do
say
any
more
i
been
frightened
to
death
somebody
would
get
that
brilliant
notion
in
his
head
especially
as
monny
and
her
aunt
came
on
board
the
only
at
monaco
esmé
is
in
a
convent
school
not
thirty
miles
from
there
but
the
secret
poor
peter
gilder
fears
for
his
millionaire
girl
would
be
child
play
to
what
might
happen
before
such
a
mistake
was
found
out
if
once
it
was
made
that
just
one
of
the
hundred
reasons
why
it
would
be
as
safe
for
monny
gilder
to
travel
with
a
bomb
in
her
as
to
have
me
in
her
train
of
dependants
she
telegraphed
to
new
york
for
me
because
of
a
stupid
thing
i
said
in
a
letter
about
being
lonely
though
she
pretends
it
would
be
too
dull
journeying
to
such
a
romantic
country
alone
with
a
mere
aunt
and
she
thinks
i
adventures
it
only
too
true
but
i
resist
her
nobody
can
why
the
first
time
i
ever
saw
monny
she
cast
herself
down
in
a
and
was
screaming
and
kicking
because
she
wanted
to
walk
while
one
adoring
father
one
sycophantic
governess
and
two
trained
nurses
wanted
her
to
get
into
an
automobile
that
was
on
my
honeymoon
heaven
save
the
mark
and
monny
was
nine
she
has
other
ways
now
of
getting
what
she
wants
but
they
even
more
effective
i
laughed
at
her
that
first
time
and
she
was
so
surprised
at
my
impudence
she
took
a
violent
fancy
to
me
but
i
do
always
laugh
at
her
now
oh
she
a
perfect
terror
i
assure
you
and
a
still
more
perfect
darling
such
an
angel
of
charity
to
the
poor
such
a
demon
of
obstinacy
with
the
rich
i
worship
her
so
does
cleopatra
so
does
everybody
who
does
hate
her
so
will
you
the
minute
you
been
introduced
and
by
the
way
why
not
why
should
i
make
myself
useful
for
once
by
arranging
a
match
between
rosamond
gilder
the
prettiest
heiress
in
america
and
lord
ernest
borrow
of
the
oldest
family
in
ireland
and
the
poorest
all
the
more
reason
why
do
you
she
might
well
what
the
good
of
her
having
all
that
money
if
she
does
get
hold
of
a
really
grand
title
to
hang
it
on
i
shall
tell
her
that
borrow
comes
down
from
boru
brian
boru
the
rightful
king
of
ireland
and
when
your
brother
dies
you
be
marquis
of
killeena
he
not
die
for
thirty
or
forty
years
let
hope
why
hope
it
when
he
likes
nobody
and
nobody
likes
him
and
everybody
likes
you
he
ca
be
happy
and
anyhow
is
it
worth
a
few
millions
to
be
lady
ernest
borrow
and
have
the
privilege
of
restoring
the
most
beautiful
old
castle
in
ireland
i
sure
killeena
would
let
her
he
would
out
of
sheer
weak
kindness
of
heart
but
she
far
too
thickly
gilded
an
heiress
for
me
to
aspire
to
a
few
thousands
a
year
is
my
most
ambitious
figure
for
a
wife
look
at
the
men
collecting
around
her
and
the
wonderful
lady
you
call
cleopatra
why
cleopatra
did
sponsors
in
baptism
no
they
did
she
cleopatra
is
as
weird
a
history
as
why
i
jones
but
she
monny
aunt
at
least
she
a
of
peter
gilder
and
as
his
only
living
relative
his
will
makes
her
monny
guardian
till
the
girl
marries
or
reaches
a
strange
guardian
but
he
did
know
she
was
going
to
turn
into
cleopatra
she
wisely
waited
to
do
that
until
he
was
dead
so
it
came
on
only
a
year
ago
it
was
a
bond
street
transplanted
to
fifth
avenue
told
her
who
she
really
was
you
know
sayda
sabri
the
woman
who
has
the
illuminated
mummy
it
cleopatra
idea
that
second
mourning
for
peter
should
be
white
nothing
but
white
her
idea
but
i
thought
miss
monny
as
you
call
her
adopted
only
her
own
ideas
how
can
a
mere
labouring
under
the
name
of
cleopatra
force
her
well
you
see
white
very
becoming
and
as
for
the
cleopatra
part
it
pleases
our
princess
to
tolerate
that
it
part
of
the
queer
history
that
mixing
me
up
with
the
family
we
come
to
spend
the
season
in
egypt
because
cleopatra
thinks
she
cleopatra
also
because
monny
that
what
she
chosen
to
call
herself
since
she
tried
to
lisp
and
could
because
monny
has
read
garden
of
allah
and
wants
the
to
take
her
that
book
had
nothing
to
do
with
egyptian
deserts
but
any
desert
will
do
for
monny
what
she
expects
it
to
do
with
her
exactly
when
it
has
taken
her
on
the
strength
of
a
cook
ticket
i
do
quite
know
but
i
may
later
because
she
vows
keep
me
at
her
side
with
hooks
of
steel
all
through
the
tour
unless
something
worse
happens
to
me
or
to
some
of
us
of
me
biddy
dear
do
be
morbid
nothing
bad
will
happen
i
tried
to
reassure
her
thank
you
for
saying
so
it
cheers
me
up
we
women
folk
are
so
in
the
habit
of
believing
anything
you
men
folk
tell
us
it
really
quaint
stop
rotting
and
tell
me
about
yourself
and
a
truce
to
heiresses
and
cleopatras
you
know
i
dying
to
hear
not
a
syllable
until
you
told
me
about
where
going
and
what
the
dickens
for
we
laughed
into
each
other
eyes
to
do
so
i
had
to
look
a
long
way
down
and
she
a
long
way
up
this
in
itself
is
a
pleasantly
victorian
thing
for
a
man
to
do
in
these
days
of
jerrybuilt
girls
on
the
same
level
or
a
story
or
two
higher
than
himself
i
not
a
tall
man
just
the
dull
average
five
foot
ten
or
eleven
that
appears
taller
while
it
keeps
lean
so
naturally
i
have
a
hopeless
yearning
for
creatures
who
pretend
to
be
engaged
when
i
ask
them
to
dance
still
there
consolation
and
homely
comfort
in
talking
with
a
little
woman
who
makes
you
feel
the
next
best
thing
to
a
giant
biddy
is
an
five
foot
four
in
her
highest
heels
and
as
she
smiled
up
at
me
i
saw
that
she
had
changed
a
jot
in
the
last
ten
years
despite
the
tragedy
that
had
involved
her
not
a
silver
thread
in
the
black
hair
not
a
line
on
the
creamy
round
face
you
just
yourself
i
said
i
ought
to
be
i
know
that
very
well
i
ought
to
be
a
dido
and
niobe
and
cassandra
rolled
into
one
i
a
brute
not
to
be
dead
or
look
a
hag
i
gone
through
horrors
and
the
secrets
i
know
could
put
dozens
of
people
in
prison
if
not
electrocute
them
but
you
see
not
the
right
type
of
person
for
the
kind
of
life
i
had
as
i
should
be
if
i
were
in
a
story
book
and
the
author
had
created
me
to
suit
my
background
i
ca
help
flapping
up
out
of
my
own
ashes
before
cold
i
ca
help
laughing
in
the
face
of
fate
and
looking
a
girl
of
at
most
while
you
do
it
if
i
look
a
girl
i
must
be
a
phenomenon
as
well
as
a
phoenix
for
nobody
knows
better
than
you
that
my
bible
age
is
if
it
a
day
and
i
think
burke
and
debrett
have
got
the
same
tale
to
tell
about
you
eh
they
have
i
was
always
delighted
to
share
something
with
you
you
can
have
the
whole
share
of
my
age
over
there
one
advantage
jones
has
she
can
if
her
forbid
go
back
to
that
classic
age
dear
to
all
sensible
adventuresses
i
afraid
i
come
under
the
head
of
adventuress
with
my
alias
and
travelling
as
companion
to
the
rich
miss
gilder
you
the
last
person
on
earth
for
the
part
your
fate
was
thrust
on
you
you
thrust
yourself
on
no
one
miss
gilder
you
collected
me
rather
as
one
of
her
she
has
a
noble
weakness
for
lame
ducks
and
though
she
fails
sometimes
in
trying
to
strengthen
their
game
legs
she
tries
gloriously
she
and
her
aunt
have
been
travelling
in
france
and
italy
guided
by
instinct
and
french
maids
and
already
monny
has
picked
up
two
weird
sure
to
bring
her
to
grief
the
most
exciting
and
deadly
specimen
is
a
perfectly
beautiful
american
girl
just
married
to
a
turkish
bey
who
met
her
in
paris
and
is
taking
her
home
to
egypt
i
have
even
seen
the
unfortunate
houri
because
the
turk
has
shut
her
up
in
their
cabin
and
pretends
she
seasick
monny
does
believe
in
the
seasickness
and
sends
secret
notes
in
presents
of
flowers
and
boxes
of
chocolate
but
i
have
seen
the
turk
he
pink
and
white
and
looks
angelic
except
for
a
gleam
deep
down
in
his
eyes
if
monny
inquires
after
his
wife
when
any
of
her
best
young
men
are
hanging
about
especially
when
there
neill
sheridan
a
young
egyptologist
from
harvard
monny
met
in
paris
or
willis
bailey
a
fascinating
sculptor
who
wants
to
study
the
crystal
eyes
of
wooden
statues
in
the
museum
at
cairo
he
is
going
to
make
them
the
fashion
in
america
next
year
yes
madame
rechid
bey
is
a
most
explosive
for
a
girl
to
have
on
her
way
to
egypt
i
not
sure
even
i
am
not
innocuous
by
comparison
though
i
do
wish
you
reminded
me
of
my
poor
little
esmé
in
her
if
any
one
should
get
the
idea
that
monny
but
i
wo
put
it
in
words
besides
me
and
the
bride
of
rechid
bey
bey
is
our
name
for
him
there
one
more
a
miss
rachel
guest
from
salem
massachusetts
a
taking
her
first
holiday
that
harmless
and
it
looks
harmless
to
an
amateur
but
wait
till
meet
her
and
see
what
instinct
tells
you
about
her
eyes
oh
we
shall
have
ructions
but
that
reminds
me
you
have
told
me
where
you
bound
or
anything
thanks
for
putting
me
among
the
but
this
sample
yet
been
collected
by
miss
gilder
you
might
be
her
salvation
and
keep
her
out
of
mischief
she
quite
wild
now
with
sheer
joy
because
she
going
to
egypt
but
do
be
serious
and
tell
me
all
i
pine
to
know
if
you
want
me
to
do
the
same
by
you
well
though
it
unimportant
compared
to
what
you
have
to
tell
an
insignificant
second
secretary
to
sir
raymond
ronalds
the
british
ambassador
at
rome
i
got
four
months
leave
ah
what
comes
of
duffing
so
skilfully
and
avoiding
all
the
things
you
did
want
to
do
till
you
got
exactly
what
you
did
want
i
remember
when
we
were
small
boy
and
girl
and
you
used
to
walk
down
to
the
vicarage
every
day
to
talk
greek
or
latin
or
something
with
father
no
to
see
you
well
you
used
to
tell
me
if
you
could
be
the
greatest
or
the
greatest
in
the
world
you
thought
you
like
to
be
a
diplomat
i
have
become
a
diplomat
yet
in
spite
of
foreign
office
grubbing
but
i
been
enjoying
life
pretty
well
fagging
up
arabic
and
modern
greek
and
playing
about
with
pleasant
people
while
pretending
to
do
my
duty
now
i
got
leave
on
account
of
a
mild
fever
which
turned
out
a
blessing
in
disguise
i
could
have
found
no
other
excuse
for
egypt
this
winter
you
speak
as
if
you
had
some
special
reason
for
going
to
egypt
i
been
wishing
to
go
more
or
less
for
years
because
you
know
if
you
have
forgotten
i
was
accidentally
born
in
cairo
while
my
father
was
fighting
in
alexandria
my
earliest
recollections
are
of
egypt
for
we
lived
there
till
i
was
four
about
the
time
i
met
and
fell
in
love
with
you
i
always
thought
i
like
to
polish
up
old
memories
but
my
special
hurry
is
because
i
anxious
to
meet
a
friend
a
chap
i
admire
and
love
beyond
all
others
i
want
to
see
him
for
his
own
sake
and
for
the
sake
of
a
plan
we
have
which
may
make
a
lot
of
difference
for
our
future
how
exciting
did
i
ever
know
him
i
think
not
well
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
who
he
is
i
hesitated
sorry
i
had
let
myself
go
because
anthony
had
written
that
he
did
want
his
movements
discussed
at
present
i
tell
you
another
time
i
said
i
want
to
talk
about
you
anybody
else
is
irrelevant
clever
duffer
your
friend
is
a
not
he
but
if
there
a
secret
anywhere
it
only
a
dull
dusty
sort
of
secret
you
would
be
interested
women
never
are
in
secrets
well
i
glad
somebody
else
besides
myself
has
a
mystery
to
hide
you
very
quick
i
irish
but
i
merciful
no
more
questions
till
you
off
your
guard
you
free
to
ask
me
all
you
like
if
there
anything
you
care
to
know
which
horrid
newspapers
have
told
you
these
last
few
years
there
are
a
thousand
things
you
did
answer
anybody
letters
after
after
after
richard
died
oh
i
can
talk
about
it
now
it
was
the
best
thing
that
could
happen
for
him
poor
fellow
life
in
hiding
was
purgatory
no
i
could
answer
letters
though
my
old
friends
you
among
them
wanted
to
be
kind
there
was
anything
i
could
let
anybody
do
for
me
monny
gilder
different
you
soon
see
why
i
smiled
indulgently
but
though
i
was
to
be
introduced
to
miss
gilder
for
the
purpose
of
being
eventually
gilded
by
her
at
the
instant
my
thoughts
were
for
my
childhood
sweetheart
brigit
burne
made
a
terrible
mess
of
things
in
marrying
when
she
was
eighteen
or
so
richard
in
the
height
of
his
celebrity
as
a
socialist
leader
people
still
believed
in
him
then
at
the
time
of
his
famous
lecturing
tour
and
visit
to
his
birthplace
on
our
green
island
and
though
he
was
more
than
twice
her
age
the
fascination
he
had
for
biddy
surprised
few
who
knew
him
he
was
eloquent
in
a
fiery
way
he
had
extraordinary
eyes
and
it
was
his
pride
to
resemble
portraits
of
lord
byron
after
an
acquaintance
of
a
month
biddy
married
i
had
just
gone
up
to
oxford
at
the
time
or
i
should
have
tried
not
to
let
it
happen
went
to
america
with
him
and
voluntarily
ceased
to
exist
for
her
friends
poor
girl
she
must
have
had
an
awakening
he
had
posed
as
a
bachelor
but
after
her
marriage
she
found
out
and
the
world
with
her
that
he
was
a
widower
with
one
child
a
little
girl
he
had
practically
abandoned
biddy
adopted
her
though
the
mother
had
been
a
rather
undesirable
frenchwoman
and
now
when
i
saw
her
smiling
at
the
tall
white
girl
on
the
i
had
thought
for
an
instant
that
biddy
and
her
stepdaughter
might
be
in
flight
together
was
a
drunkard
as
well
as
a
demagogue
and
not
long
after
brigit
flitting
with
him
there
was
a
scandal
about
the
accepting
of
bribes
from
politicians
on
the
opposing
side
apparently
his
greatest
enemies
but
a
minor
scandal
compared
to
what
came
some
years
afterward
name
was
implicated
in
the
blowing
up
of
the
building
in
washington
and
the
wrecking
of
senator
marlowe
special
train
after
his
speech
against
socialist
interests
but
the
coward
turned
informer
against
his
friends
and
associates
in
the
secret
society
of
which
he
had
been
a
leader
and
saved
himself
by
sending
them
to
prison
from
that
day
until
his
death
he
lived
the
life
of
a
hunted
animal
flying
from
the
hounds
of
vengeance
brigit
stood
by
him
in
spite
of
threats
against
her
life
as
well
as
his
and
the
life
of
the
child
since
then
though
she
answered
none
of
our
letters
we
had
heard
rumours
the
girl
esmé
whom
the
avengers
had
threatened
to
kidnap
was
supposed
to
be
hidden
in
some
in
europe
as
for
brigit
she
was
said
to
be
training
for
a
hospital
nurse
reported
to
have
become
a
missionary
in
india
china
and
one
or
two
other
countries
seen
on
the
stage
and
traced
to
johannesburg
where
she
had
married
a
yet
here
she
was
on
board
the
unchanged
in
looks
or
nature
and
the
guest
of
a
much
paragraphed
much
proposed
to
american
heiress
to
egypt
while
brigit
was
telling
me
the
real
story
of
her
last
two
years
as
governess
companion
teacher
of
music
and
journalist
miss
gilder
regarded
us
sidewise
from
amid
her
bodyguard
of
young
men
evidently
she
was
dying
to
know
who
was
the
acquaintance
her
darling
biddy
had
picked
up
in
the
moment
her
back
was
turned
and
at
last
unable
to
restrain
herself
longer
she
made
use
of
some
magic
trick
to
attach
the
band
of
youths
to
her
aunt
then
separating
herself
with
almost
indecent
haste
from
the
group
she
marched
up
to
us
gazing
i
might
say
staring
with
large
unfriendly
eyes
at
the
intruder
brigit
promptly
accounted
for
me
however
rolling
her
r
patriotically
because
i
reminded
her
of
ireland
do
let
me
introduce
lord
ernest
borrow
she
said
i
must
have
told
you
about
him
in
my
stories
when
you
were
a
child
for
he
was
me
first
love
it
was
the
other
way
round
i
objected
she
would
look
at
me
i
adored
her
biddy
glared
a
warning
her
eyes
said
silly
fellow
do
you
know
every
girl
wants
to
be
the
one
and
only
love
of
a
man
life
i
had
supposed
that
this
old
craze
had
gone
out
of
fashion
but
perhaps
there
are
a
few
primitive
things
which
will
never
go
out
of
fashion
with
women
now
that
i
had
miss
gilder
proud
young
face
opposite
mine
i
saw
that
it
was
quite
so
perfect
as
i
fancied
when
she
flashed
by
in
her
tall
whiteness
her
nose
pure
greek
in
profile
seen
in
full
was
well
just
neat
american
a
straight
determined
little
nose
the
full
red
mouth
not
small
struck
me
as
being
determined
also
rather
than
classic
despite
the
daintily
drawn
cupid
bow
of
the
short
upper
lip
i
realized
too
that
the
and
eyes
were
of
the
usual
possessed
by
half
the
girls
one
knows
and
as
for
the
thick
wavy
hair
pushed
crisply
forward
by
the
white
hood
now
it
was
out
of
the
glamour
there
was
more
brown
than
gold
in
it
i
said
to
myself
that
the
face
with
the
firm
cleft
chin
was
only
just
pretty
enough
to
give
a
great
heiress
or
a
youthful
princess
the
reputation
of
a
beauty
a
combination
desired
and
generally
produced
by
journalists
then
as
i
was
thinking
this
while
brigit
explained
me
miss
gilder
suddenly
smiled
i
was
dazzled
no
wonder
biddy
loved
her
it
would
be
a
wonder
if
i
did
love
her
myself
before
i
knew
what
was
happening
and
so
i
should
instantly
have
done
perhaps
if
it
had
been
for
biddy
eyes
seeming
to
come
between
mine
and
miss
gilder
and
the
fact
that
at
the
moment
i
was
in
quest
of
another
treasure
than
a
woman
heart
my
thoughts
were
running
ahead
of
the
ship
to
alexandria
to
find
out
from
anthony
fenton
antoun
effendi
the
biggest
boys
used
to
nickname
him
at
school
more
about
the
true
history
of
that
treasure
than
he
dared
trust
to
paper
and
ink
and
the
post
office
so
i
put
off
falling
in
love
with
rosamond
gilder
till
i
should
have
seen
anthony
and
tidied
up
my
distracted
mind
a
little
later
would
do
i
told
myself
because
owing
to
the
fact
that
my
ancestral
castle
had
figured
in
biddy
tales
of
long
ago
i
was
annexed
as
one
of
the
allowed
to
make
a
fifth
at
the
small
flowery
table
under
a
desirable
porthole
in
the
green
and
white
restaurant
also
i
was
invited
to
go
about
with
the
ladies
and
show
them
cairo
just
how
much
going
about
and
falling
in
love
i
should
be
able
to
do
there
depended
on
antoun
effendi
but
when
biddy
congratulated
me
on
my
luck
and
chance
of
success
in
the
scheme
i
said
nothing
of
anthony
chapter
ii
cleopatra
and
the
ship
mystery
now
at
last
i
can
skip
over
the
three
days
at
sea
and
get
to
our
arrival
at
alexandria
because
as
i
said
the
exciting
part
began
soon
after
at
cairo
they
were
delightful
days
for
the
is
a
paris
hotel
disguised
as
a
liner
and
no
man
with
blood
in
his
veins
could
help
enjoying
the
society
of
brigit
and
rosamond
gilder
cleopatra
too
was
not
to
be
despised
as
a
charmer
and
then
there
was
the
human
interest
of
the
the
one
with
the
eyes
and
the
one
who
had
reluctantly
developed
into
the
ship
mystery
still
in
spite
of
biddy
and
monny
and
the
others
and
not
for
them
my
heart
beat
fast
when
on
the
afternoon
of
the
third
day
out
from
naples
the
ship
brought
us
suddenly
in
sight
of
something
strange
we
were
moving
through
a
calm
sea
more
like
liquefied
marble
than
water
for
it
was
creamy
white
rather
than
blue
veined
with
azure
and
streaked
as
marble
is
with
pink
and
gold
far
away
across
this
gleaming
floor
blossomed
a
long
line
of
lotus
flowers
white
and
yellow
against
a
silver
sky
the
effect
was
magical
and
the
wonder
grew
when
the
big
turned
into
domes
and
cupolas
and
spires
rising
out
of
the
sea
unimaginative
people
remarked
that
the
coast
looked
so
flat
and
uninteresting
they
did
see
why
alexander
had
wanted
to
bother
with
it
but
they
were
the
sort
of
people
who
ought
to
stop
at
home
in
london
or
birmingham
or
chicago
and
not
make
innocent
burn
with
unchristian
feelings
soon
i
should
see
anthony
and
hear
his
news
i
felt
sure
he
would
be
at
alexandria
to
meet
the
ship
when
antoun
effendi
makes
up
his
mind
to
do
a
thing
he
will
crawl
from
under
a
falling
sky
to
do
it
as
the
swept
on
i
hardly
saw
the
glittering
city
on
its
vast
of
green
and
gold
guarded
by
sea
forts
like
sleepy
crocodiles
my
mind
eyes
were
picturing
anthony
as
he
would
look
after
his
wild
balkan
experiences
brown
and
lean
even
haggard
and
bearded
perhaps
a
different
man
from
the
smart
young
officer
of
everyday
life
unless
he
contrived
to
refit
in
the
short
time
since
his
return
to
egypt
a
day
or
two
at
most
according
to
my
calculation
but
all
my
imaginings
fell
short
of
the
truth
as
i
thought
of
anthony
east
came
and
stood
beside
me
i
knew
she
was
there
before
i
turned
to
look
because
of
the
delicate
tinkling
of
little
egyptian
amulets
which
is
her
accompaniment
her
and
because
of
the
scent
of
sandalwood
with
which
in
obedience
to
the
ancient
custom
of
egyptian
queens
she
perfumes
her
hair
i
do
think
i
have
described
monny
gilder
aunt
according
to
my
conception
of
her
though
i
may
have
hinted
at
biddy
biddy
having
a
habit
of
focussing
her
sense
of
humour
on
any
female
she
does
wholly
love
may
not
do
east
justice
the
fact
is
monny
aunt
is
a
handsome
creature
distinctly
a
charmer
who
may
at
most
have
reached
the
age
when
cleopatra
antony
and
caesar
cleopatra
died
in
the
prime
of
her
beauty
if
east
chooses
to
date
herself
at
any
man
not
a
confirmed
misanthrope
must
believe
her
biddy
says
that
until
peter
gilder
was
safely
dead
clara
east
was
just
an
ordinary
respectable
widow
of
a
new
york
stockbroker
superstitious
perhaps
fond
of
consulting
palmists
and
possessing
billikens
or
other
mascots
how
many
women
are
free
from
superstition
slightly
oriental
in
her
love
of
sumptuous
colours
and
jewellery
but
then
her
mother
peter
gilder
was
a
beautiful
jewish
opera
singer
after
peter
death
his
gave
up
novels
for
egyptian
and
roman
history
took
to
studying
hieroglyphics
and
learning
translations
of
greek
poetry
she
invited
a
clairvoyant
and
claiming
egyptian
origin
to
visit
at
her
madison
square
flat
sayda
sabri
banished
from
bond
street
years
ago
took
up
her
residence
in
new
york
accompanied
by
her
tame
mummy
of
course
it
is
the
mummy
of
a
princess
and
she
keeps
it
illuminated
with
blue
lights
in
an
inner
sanctum
where
the
thing
stands
upright
in
its
brilliantly
painted
mummy
case
facing
the
door
about
the
time
of
sayda
visit
it
was
noticed
by
east
friends
this
according
to
biddy
that
the
colour
of
the
lady
hair
was
slowly
but
surely
changing
from
black
to
chestnut
then
to
auburn
she
was
heard
to
remark
casually
that
queen
cleopatra
hair
had
been
red
she
took
to
rich
eastern
scents
to
whitening
her
face
as
eastern
women
of
rank
have
whitened
theirs
since
time
immemorial
the
shadows
round
her
eyes
were
intensified
her
full
lips
turned
from
healthful
pink
to
carmine
the
ends
of
her
tapering
fingers
blushed
rosily
as
sticks
of
coral
the
style
of
her
dress
changed
at
the
moment
of
going
into
purple
as
second
mourning
for
peter
and
became
oriental
even
to
the
shape
of
her
hats
and
the
design
of
her
jewellery
she
did
away
with
crests
and
monograms
on
handkerchiefs
stationery
luggage
and
so
on
substituting
a
curious
little
oval
containing
strange
devices
which
monny
discovered
to
be
the
cartouche
of
cleopatra
then
the
whole
truth
burst
forth
sayda
sabri
crystal
had
shown
that
clara
east
née
gilder
was
the
reincarnation
of
cleopatra
the
great
of
egypt
there
had
been
another
incarnation
in
between
but
it
was
of
no
account
and
like
a
poor
relation
who
has
disgraced
a
family
the
less
said
about
it
the
better
the
lady
did
not
proclaim
her
identity
from
the
housetops
rare
souls
possessing
knowledge
of
egyptian
lore
might
draw
their
own
conclusions
from
the
cartouche
on
her
and
other
things
only
monny
and
a
few
intimates
were
told
the
truth
at
first
but
afterward
it
leaked
out
as
secrets
do
and
east
seemed
shyly
pleased
if
discreet
questions
were
asked
concerning
her
amulets
and
the
cartouche
now
i
never
feel
inclined
to
laugh
at
a
pretty
woman
it
is
more
agreeable
as
well
as
gallant
to
laugh
with
her
but
the
trouble
is
cleopatra
does
go
in
for
laughter
she
takes
life
seriously
not
only
has
she
no
sense
of
humour
but
she
does
not
know
the
difference
between
it
and
a
sense
of
fun
which
she
can
understand
if
a
joke
about
somebody
else
is
explained
she
is
grateful
to
me
because
i
look
her
straight
in
the
eyes
when
the
subject
of
egypt
is
mentioned
sheridan
from
harvard
has
been
in
her
bad
books
since
he
put
ptolemaic
rulers
outside
of
the
pale
of
egyptian
history
called
their
art
ornate
and
bad
mentioned
that
each
of
their
queens
was
named
cleopatra
and
classified
the
lot
as
modern
almost
suburban
east
leaning
beside
me
on
the
rail
was
burning
with
thoughts
inspired
by
alexandria
she
had
plutarch
lives
under
her
arm
and
hypatia
in
her
hand
of
course
she
dropped
them
both
one
after
the
other
and
i
picked
them
up
do
you
know
lord
ernest
she
said
in
the
low
rich
voice
she
is
cultivating
i
do
mind
telling
you
that
i
felt
as
if
i
were
coming
home
after
a
long
absence
monny
wanted
to
see
egypt
i
was
dying
to
that
the
difference
between
us
it
natural
i
answered
sympathetically
yes
considering
everything
yet
we
both
afraid
she
in
one
way
i
in
another
i
have
told
her
she
has
told
me
but
i
know
she
has
the
same
impression
i
have
that
something
going
to
something
very
great
to
change
the
whole
of
life
in
egypt
it
seems
to
me
i
can
remember
calling
it
you
know
it
was
khem
until
the
arabs
came
and
named
it
misr
do
you
believe
in
impressions
like
that
i
do
disbelieve
i
said
some
people
are
more
sensitive
than
others
yes
or
else
they
older
souls
but
it
may
be
the
same
thing
i
ca
fancy
monny
an
old
soul
can
you
yet
she
may
be
for
she
very
intelligent
although
so
i
think
what
she
afraid
of
is
getting
interested
in
some
wonderful
man
with
turkish
or
egyptian
blood
a
magnificent
creature
like
you
read
of
in
books
you
know
then
you
have
to
give
them
up
in
the
last
chapter
and
send
them
away
i
suppose
there
such
men
in
real
life
i
doubt
if
there
are
such
romantic
figures
as
the
books
make
out
i
tried
to
reassure
her
there
might
be
a
prince
or
two
handsome
and
cultivated
educated
in
england
perhaps
for
some
of
the
are
sent
from
egypt
to
oxford
and
cambridge
just
as
they
are
in
india
but
even
if
miss
gilder
should
meet
a
man
of
that
sort
i
should
say
she
was
too
sensible
and
oh
she
is
almost
too
much
so
for
a
young
girl
and
she
has
a
detestation
for
any
one
with
a
drop
of
dark
blood
in
america
she
does
even
like
jews
and
that
makes
friction
between
us
if
we
ever
happen
to
argue
for
maybe
you
do
know
my
mother
was
a
jewess
i
proud
of
her
memory
but
that
just
if
you
can
understand
monny
in
egypt
some
girls
would
like
to
have
a
tiny
flirtation
with
a
gorgeous
eastern
creature
of
course
he
must
be
a
bey
or
prince
or
something
otherwise
it
would
be
but
monny
would
hate
herself
for
being
attracted
yet
i
know
she
dreads
it
happening
because
of
the
way
i
heard
her
rave
against
the
heroines
of
novels
saying
she
has
no
patience
with
them
they
ought
to
have
more
strength
of
mind
even
if
it
broke
their
hearts
i
wondered
if
biddy
too
suspected
some
such
fear
in
the
mind
of
her
adored
girl
and
if
that
were
one
reason
why
she
had
turned
matchmaker
for
my
benefit
since
the
first
day
out
she
had
used
strategems
to
throw
us
together
and
it
seemed
that
years
ago
when
she
used
to
teach
the
little
girl
french
monny
favourite
stories
had
been
of
castle
killeena
and
my
boyish
exploits
on
the
crags
biddy
said
that
this
was
a
splendid
beginning
if
i
had
the
sense
to
follow
it
up
and
you
i
went
on
to
east
what
do
you
feel
is
going
to
happen
to
you
in
the
land
of
khem
oh
i
do
know
she
sighed
i
wish
i
did
and
exactly
the
word
i
just
know
that
something
will
happen
i
wonder
if
history
does
repeat
itself
i
should
hate
to
be
bitten
by
an
asp
asps
are
out
of
fashion
i
comforted
her
i
doubt
if
you
could
find
one
in
all
of
egypt
though
i
remember
my
egyptian
nurse
used
to
say
there
were
cobras
in
the
desert
in
summer
anyhow
we
be
away
before
summer
i
suppose
so
she
agreed
yet
who
knows
what
will
become
of
any
of
us
madame
rechid
bey
will
be
staying
of
course
i
do
know
whether
to
be
sorry
for
her
or
not
the
bey
he
has
brown
eyes
and
is
as
white
as
you
or
i
probably
it
true
that
she
been
too
seasick
to
leave
her
room
for
the
last
ten
days
though
monny
and
i
mean
jones
think
she
shut
up
because
men
stared
and
because
sheridan
talked
to
her
as
for
me
there
always
that
question
asking
itself
in
my
mind
is
going
to
happen
and
i
hear
it
twice
as
loud
as
before
in
sight
of
alexandria
rakoti
we
lagidae
used
to
call
the
city
as
she
spoke
the
long
oriental
eyes
glanced
at
me
sidewise
but
my
trustworthy
celtic
features
showed
a
grave
intelligent
interest
in
her
statements
it
must
be
she
went
on
encouraged
that
i
the
reincarnation
of
cleopatra
otherwise
how
i
have
the
sensation
of
remembering
everything
there
no
other
way
to
account
for
it
and
you
know
my
modern
name
clara
does
begin
with
sayda
must
be
right
told
lots
of
women
the
most
extraordinary
things
you
really
ought
to
consult
her
lord
ernest
if
you
ever
go
to
new
york
i
did
not
say
as
neill
sheridan
might
that
a
frothy
course
of
egyptian
historical
novels
would
account
for
anything
i
simply
looked
as
diplomatic
training
can
teach
any
one
to
look
evidently
it
was
the
right
look
in
the
right
place
for
cleopatra
continued
more
courageously
recalling
the
great
pharos
of
white
marble
which
used
to
be
one
of
the
world
wonders
in
her
day
the
museum
and
the
marvellous
library
which
took
fire
while
julius
caesar
burned
the
fleet
nearby
in
the
harbour
think
of
the
philosophers
who
deserted
the
college
of
heliopolis
for
alexandria
she
said
antony
was
more
of
a
soldier
than
a
student
but
even
he
grieved
for
the
library
you
know
he
tried
to
console
cleopatra
by
making
her
a
present
of
two
hundred
thousand
mss
from
the
library
of
the
king
of
pergamus
it
was
a
generous
thought
like
antony
does
the
harbour
looked
changed
i
hastened
to
inquire
not
from
a
distance
though
landing
may
be
a
shock
they
tell
me
all
so
italian
now
it
was
greek
in
old
days
i
read
that
there
is
a
stone
left
of
my
of
the
lovely
place
on
lochias
point
except
the
foundations
they
found
in
the
seventies
but
i
must
go
to
see
what
left
of
the
baths
even
though
there
only
a
bit
of
mosaic
and
the
remains
of
a
room
monny
anxious
to
get
on
to
cairo
but
we
shall
come
back
to
alexandria
later
lord
ernest
when
i
shut
my
eyes
i
really
do
seem
to
picture
the
mareotic
lake
and
the
buildings
that
made
alexandria
the
glory
of
the
world
do
you
remember
what
strabo
said
about
deinchares
the
architect
who
laid
out
the
plan
of
the
city
in
the
shape
of
a
macedonian
mantle
to
please
alexander
i
not
as
well
up
in
history
as
you
are
i
said
though
studied
a
bit
because
i
was
born
in
egypt
poor
alexander
did
live
long
in
his
fine
city
did
he
i
wonder
what
he
think
of
it
now
and
i
wonder
if
his
palace
was
handsomer
than
the
khedive
that
huge
white
building
with
the
pillars
and
domes
i
seem
to
remember
what
you
remember
too
you
to
consult
sayda
i
did
mean
exactly
what
you
mean
i
explained
humbly
still
why
should
i
have
lived
in
egypt
long
ago
the
learned
ones
say
always
drawn
back
where
you
been
in
other
states
of
existence
that
true
i
sure
well
then
why
should
i
have
the
same
sort
of
right
to
egypt
you
have
if
you
were
cleopatra
i
believe
you
must
have
been
because
you
look
as
she
ought
to
have
looked
you
know
why
should
i
have
been
a
friend
of
marc
antony
coming
from
rome
to
give
him
good
advice
and
trying
to
persuade
oh
that
he
ought
to
give
me
up
no
indeed
to
urge
him
to
leave
the
island
where
he
hid
even
from
you
did
they
call
it
timoneum
why
could
antony
play
his
cards
so
as
to
keep
cleopatra
and
the
world
too
she
have
liked
him
better
would
she
my
friend
antoun
effendi
i
mean
anthony
fenton
i
stopped
short
for
the
less
said
about
fenton
the
better
at
present
but
cleopatra
caught
me
up
what
have
you
really
a
friend
antony
where
does
he
live
and
he
like
i
hesitated
and
glancing
round
for
inspiration
in
other
words
for
some
harmless
necessary
fib
i
saw
that
brigit
and
monny
had
arrived
on
the
scene
they
had
been
pacing
the
deck
arm
in
arm
and
now
arrested
by
east
question
they
hovered
near
awaiting
my
answer
with
vague
curiosity
a
twinkle
in
biddy
eyes
which
i
caught
rattled
me
completely
i
missed
all
the
easiest
fibs
and
could
catch
hold
of
nothing
but
the
bare
truth
there
are
moments
like
that
when
do
what
you
will
you
must
be
truthful
or
silent
and
silence
fires
suspicion
what
is
he
i
echoed
feebly
oh
captain
fenton
he
in
the
gyppy
army
stationed
up
at
khartum
hundreds
of
miles
beyond
where
boats
go
you
would
be
interested
in
anthony
because
he
spells
his
name
with
an
and
he
dark
and
thin
not
a
bit
like
antony
who
was
a
big
stout
fellow
i
always
heard
and
fair
big
but
stout
cleopatra
corrected
me
and
and
if
he
incarnated
again
he
may
be
dark
for
a
change
as
for
the
that
not
important
i
wonder
if
we
shall
meet
your
anthony
we
think
of
going
to
khartum
do
we
monny
yes
said
the
girl
shortly
she
was
always
rather
short
in
her
manner
at
that
time
when
in
her
opinion
her
aunt
was
being
silly
i
gathered
from
a
vexed
flash
in
the
gray
eyes
that
there
had
never
been
any
hint
of
an
impending
antony
is
your
friend
in
khartum
now
biddy
ventured
in
her
creamiest
voice
the
twinkle
was
carefully
turned
off
like
the
light
of
a
dark
lantern
but
i
knew
well
that
jones
was
recalling
a
certain
conversation
in
which
i
had
refused
to
satisfy
her
curiosity
quick
irish
mind
has
a
way
of
matching
mental
jigsaw
puzzles
even
when
vital
bits
appear
to
be
missing
and
if
she
could
make
a
cat
paw
of
cleopatra
the
witch
would
not
be
above
doing
it
i
bore
her
no
grudge
who
could
bear
laughing
yet
tragic
biddy
a
grudge
but
i
wished
that
she
and
monny
were
at
the
other
end
of
the
deck
i
er
really
i
do
know
where
my
friend
is
just
now
i
answered
with
more
or
less
foundation
of
truth
i
wonder
if
i
did
read
in
the
papers
about
a
captain
fenton
who
took
advantage
of
leave
he
got
to
make
a
rush
for
the
balkans
and
see
the
fighting
from
the
lines
of
the
allies
biddy
murmured
with
dreadful
intelligence
can
he
be
your
captain
fenton
i
fancy
been
stationed
in
the
sudan
and
he
was
officially
supposed
to
have
gone
home
to
spend
his
leave
in
england
anyhow
there
was
a
row
of
some
sort
after
he
and
another
man
dropped
down
on
to
the
turks
out
of
a
greek
aeroplane
or
was
it
a
servian
one
anyhow
i
know
he
to
have
been
in
it
and
and
wrote
letters
to
the
about
british
officers
who
did
mind
their
own
business
why
i
saw
the
papers
on
board
this
ship
they
were
old
ones
papers
on
ships
always
are
but
i
think
they
came
on
at
algiers
or
somewhere
probably
i
witheringly
replied
did
come
on
at
algiers
so
i
do
know
anything
about
it
diplomatists
never
do
know
anything
official
do
they
duffer
dear
smiled
biddy
i
wager
your
friend
is
interesting
even
if
he
does
spell
himself
with
an
and
weighs
two
stone
less
than
his
namesake
from
rome
east
believes
in
reincarnation
and
i
not
sure
i
do
though
monny
so
young
she
does
believe
in
anything
just
suppose
your
friend
is
a
reincarnation
of
antony
without
an
and
suppose
too
by
some
strange
trick
of
fate
he
should
meet
you
in
alexandria
or
cairo
you
introduce
him
to
us
would
you
it
the
most
unlikely
thing
in
the
world
and
he
be
no
good
to
you
he
a
man
man
he
thinks
he
does
like
women
does
like
women
echoed
monny
gilder
he
must
be
a
curmudgeon
or
has
he
been
jilted
rather
not
too
impulsively
i
defended
the
absent
girls
go
mad
about
him
he
has
to
keep
them
off
with
a
stick
he
got
other
things
to
think
of
than
girls
things
he
believes
are
more
important
though
of
course
he
mistaken
he
find
that
out
some
day
when
he
has
more
time
so
far
he
been
hunting
other
game
often
in
wild
places
a
book
might
be
written
on
his
adventures
what
kind
of
adventures
tell
us
about
them
said
biddy
up
to
the
balkan
one
which
you
deny
having
heard
of
you
would
care
about
his
sort
of
adventures
there
are
any
women
in
them
said
i
women
want
love
stories
it
only
the
heroines
they
care
for
not
the
heroes
and
i
do
somehow
see
the
right
heroine
for
fenton
story
i
noticed
an
expression
dawning
on
cleopatra
face
as
i
thus
bereft
her
of
a
possible
antony
with
an
h
there
was
a
softening
of
the
long
eyes
and
the
glimmer
of
a
smile
which
said
am
i
cleopatra
for
nothing
never
had
she
looked
handsomer
never
before
had
i
thought
of
her
as
really
dangerous
i
been
inclined
to
poke
fun
at
the
lady
for
her
superstition
and
her
cartouche
and
in
general
but
suddenly
i
realized
that
her
was
no
more
exaggerated
than
that
of
many
a
beauty
of
the
stage
and
of
society
and
that
nowadays
women
who
are
well
can
be
formidable
rivals
for
younger
and
simpler
sisters
not
that
i
feared
much
for
anthony
from
cleopatra
or
any
other
female
thing
for
i
come
to
consider
him
practically
still
i
saw
danger
that
the
lady
might
make
a
dead
set
at
him
if
she
got
the
chance
and
all
through
my
stupidity
in
giving
away
his
name
antony
was
a
thrilling
password
to
that
mysterious
something
which
she
expected
to
happen
in
egypt
and
already
she
regarded
my
friend
as
a
ram
caught
in
the
bushes
for
a
sacrifice
on
her
altar
instead
of
screening
him
i
had
dragged
him
in
front
of
the
footlights
but
fortunately
there
was
still
time
to
jerk
down
the
curtain
i
threw
a
glance
at
brigit
and
monny
and
was
relieved
to
find
that
their
attention
was
distracted
by
a
new
arrival
miss
rachel
guest
from
salem
massachusetts
a
pale
thin
lanky
copy
of
our
rose
with
the
beauty
and
bloom
left
out
but
a
pair
of
eyes
to
redeem
the
colourless
face
oh
yes
a
pair
of
eyes
strange
hungry
waiting
eyes
when
i
am
alone
i
fear
monny
favourite
who
started
out
to
see
the
world
on
a
legacy
of
two
thousand
dollars
and
won
miss
gilder
admiration
and
hospitality
through
her
unassuming
pluck
to
my
mind
she
is
the
ideal
adventuress
of
a
new
unknown
and
therefore
deadly
type
but
for
once
i
rejoiced
at
sight
of
the
pallid
fragile
woman
so
cheerful
in
spite
of
frail
health
so
frank
about
her
years
she
had
news
to
tell
of
a
nature
so
exciting
that
after
a
whisper
or
two
cleopatra
forgot
anthony
in
her
desire
to
know
the
latest
development
in
the
ship
mystery
my
stewardess
says
he
wo
let
his
wife
land
till
we
all
off
murmured
the
in
her
colourless
voice
she
heard
the
end
of
a
conversation
when
she
carried
the
poor
girl
lunch
to
the
door
just
a
word
or
two
so
we
sha
see
her
again
i
suppose
oh
yes
we
shall
said
monny
if
wretched
bey
can
get
a
private
boat
so
can
i
not
desert
her
if
i
have
to
stay
on
board
the
the
whole
night
all
four
began
talking
together
eagerly
and
blessing
miss
guest
i
sneaked
away
presently
i
saw
that
clever
neill
sheridan
and
handsome
willis
bailey
the
two
of
wretched
bey
had
joined
the
group
by
this
time
the
roofs
and
domes
and
minarets
of
alexandria
sparkled
in
clearly
sketched
outlines
between
and
sea
sunset
of
egypt
which
divided
of
cloud
emerald
dhurra
gold
of
desert
and
sapphire
waters
into
separate
bands
of
colour
vivid
as
the
stripes
of
a
rainbow
there
was
a
new
buzz
of
excitement
on
the
decks
and
in
the
ivy
draped
veranda
café
those
who
had
been
studying
baedeker
gabbled
history
ancient
and
modern
until
the
conquest
of
alexander
and
the
bombardment
of
became
a
hopeless
jumble
in
the
ears
of
the
ignorant
bores
who
had
travelled
inflicted
advice
on
victims
who
had
not
people
told
each
other
pointless
anecdotes
of
the
last
time
i
was
in
egypt
while
those
forced
to
listen
did
so
with
the
air
of
panthers
waiting
to
pounce
a
pause
for
breath
on
the
part
of
the
enemy
gave
the
opportunity
to
spring
into
the
breach
with
an
adventure
of
their
own
we
took
an
arab
pilot
on
board
the
first
arab
ever
seen
by
the
ladies
of
my
party
and
before
the
red
torch
of
sunset
had
burned
down
to
dusky
purple
tenders
like
big
black
turtles
were
swimming
out
to
the
we
slaves
of
the
rose
however
had
surrendered
all
personal
interest
in
these
objects
the
word
of
miss
gilder
had
gone
forth
and
unless
rechid
bey
changed
his
mind
at
the
last
minute
we
were
all
to
lurk
in
ambush
until
he
appeared
with
his
wife
then
somehow
monny
was
to
snatch
her
chance
for
a
word
with
the
ship
mystery
and
whatever
happened
none
of
us
were
to
stir
until
it
had
been
snatched
arguments
even
from
biddy
were
of
no
avail
and
mine
were
silenced
by
cold
permission
to
go
away
by
myself
if
i
chose
it
was
terrible
it
was
wicked
to
talk
of
people
making
their
own
beds
and
then
lying
in
them
it
was
nonsense
to
say
that
even
if
the
wife
of
rechid
bey
asked
for
help
we
could
do
nothing
of
course
we
would
do
something
if
the
girl
wanted
to
be
saved
she
should
be
saved
if
monny
had
to
act
alone
whatever
happened
sheridan
and
bailey
must
remain
in
the
background
as
the
very
sight
of
them
would
drive
wretched
bey
i
was
thinking
of
anthony
surprise
when
one
after
the
other
two
tenders
should
reach
the
quay
without
me
and
if
the
gilded
rose
had
not
been
so
sweet
her
youthful
cocksureness
would
have
made
me
yearn
to
slap
her
in
spite
of
all
however
the
girl
excitement
became
contagious
as
passengers
crowded
down
the
gangway
and
rechid
bey
did
not
appear
allah
allah
cried
the
boatman
and
the
arab
porters
as
they
hauled
huge
trunks
off
the
ship
onto
a
float
then
one
after
the
other
the
two
tenders
puffed
away
packed
from
stem
to
stern
a
few
people
for
whom
there
was
no
room
embarked
in
small
boats
manned
by
jabbering
arabs
two
of
these
still
moved
up
and
down
under
the
black
mountainous
side
of
the
ship
and
the
officer
whose
duty
it
was
to
see
the
passengers
off
was
visibly
restless
he
wanted
to
know
if
my
lordship
was
ready
and
my
lordship
brain
was
straining
after
an
excuse
for
further
delay
when
a
man
and
woman
arrived
opportunely
rechid
bey
and
a
veiled
muffled
form
hooked
to
his
arm
a
slender
appealing
little
figure
and
through
the
veil
i
fancied
that
i
caught
a
gleam
of
large
wistful
anxious
eyes
the
ladies
were
lying
in
wait
out
of
sight
and
i
dodged
behind
the
sturdy
blue
shoulders
guarding
the
gangway
this
was
my
first
glimpse
of
the
ship
mystery
and
though
i
did
not
like
my
job
i
had
to
surprise
rechid
bey
and
take
his
mind
off
his
wife
my
curiosity
was
pricked
the
figure
in
sealskin
looked
very
girlish
the
veiled
head
was
bowed
the
mystery
took
on
human
personality
for
me
and
monny
gilder
was
no
longer
obstinate
she
was
a
loyal
friend
i
did
not
see
that
we
could
be
of
use
to
the
poor
little
fool
who
had
married
a
turk
yet
i
was
suddenly
ready
to
do
what
i
could
as
rechid
bey
brought
his
wife
to
the
top
of
the
gangway
i
lounged
out
and
spoke
disconcerted
the
stout
man
of
thirty
let
drop
the
arm
of
the
girl
putting
her
behind
him
and
this
was
what
monny
wanted
they
would
have
an
instant
for
a
few
disjointed
words
monny
might
perhaps
have
time
to
promise
help
which
the
girl
dared
not
ask
even
behind
her
back
good
evening
i
said
in
french
taking
advantage
of
a
acquaintance
is
that
smart
boat
down
there
for
you
i
was
trying
to
secure
it
in
my
best
arabic
but
the
fellow
said
it
was
engaged
yes
it
is
mine
rechid
answered
civilly
trying
to
hide
his
annoyance
i
telegraphed
from
naples
to
a
friend
in
alexandria
to
send
me
a
private
boat
i
do
not
like
crowds
neither
do
i
so
i
waited
too
i
explained
they
told
me
there
were
always
boats
and
my
big
luggage
has
gone
i
suppose
yours
has
too
no
doubt
said
rechid
bey
good
night
milord
borrow
he
turned
quickly
to
his
wife
as
if
to
catch
her
at
something
but
the
slim
veiled
mystery
stood
meekly
awaiting
his
will
to
my
intense
relief
monny
and
her
friends
were
invisible
i
could
hardly
wait
until
the
two
figures
had
passed
out
of
sight
down
the
gangway
to
know
whether
my
skirmishing
attack
had
been
successful
well
i
asked
as
miss
gilder
jones
cleopatra
rachel
guest
and
two
maids
filed
out
from
concealment
did
i
give
you
time
enough
did
you
get
the
chance
you
wanted
yes
thank
you
ever
so
much
said
monny
with
one
of
those
dazzling
smiles
that
would
make
her
a
beauty
even
if
she
were
not
the
favourite
sunday
supplement
heiress
i
counted
on
you
and
had
counted
on
me
she
must
have
known
i
would
fail
her
for
she
had
this
bit
of
paper
ready
when
i
jumped
out
she
slipped
it
into
my
hand
we
need
to
say
a
word
and
wretched
bey
has
no
idea
i
came
near
her
a
bit
of
paper
i
echoed
with
interest
for
it
sounded
the
obvious
secret
thing
a
bit
of
paper
stealthily
slid
from
hand
to
hand
yes
with
her
address
on
it
nothing
more
in
writing
but
two
other
words
pricked
with
a
pin
do
you
see
if
her
husband
had
pounced
on
it
no
harm
would
have
been
done
he
would
have
noticed
the
as
a
woman
would
i
thought
she
was
going
to
live
in
cairo
and
i
believe
she
thought
so
too
at
first
but
written
down
the
name
of
a
house
in
a
place
called
asiut
did
you
ever
hear
of
such
a
town
lord
ernest
oh
yes
said
i
the
nile
boats
stop
there
and
people
see
tombs
and
mummied
cats
and
buy
silver
shawls
good
said
monny
boat
shall
stop
there
but
not
only
for
tombs
or
cats
or
silver
shawls
i
have
an
idea
that
the
poor
girl
is
frightened
and
wants
me
to
help
her
escape
great
heavens
i
exclaimed
you
must
on
any
account
get
mixed
up
in
an
adventure
of
that
sort
remember
this
is
egypt
i
do
care
said
monny
if
it
the
moon
she
believed
that
this
settled
the
matter
i
believed
the
exact
opposite
but
i
left
it
at
that
for
the
moment
as
the
boat
was
waiting
and
asiut
seemed
a
long
way
off
this
was
my
first
lesson
in
what
brigit
called
monny
little
ways
but
the
second
lesson
was
on
the
heels
of
the
first
chapter
iii
a
disappointment
and
a
dragoman
it
was
a
blow
not
to
see
anthony
on
the
quay
and
other
blows
rained
thick
and
fast
my
two
consolations
were
that
i
was
actually
in
egypt
and
that
in
the
confusion
rechid
bey
with
the
veiled
figure
of
his
silent
bride
had
slipped
away
without
further
incidents
their
disappearance
was
regretted
by
no
one
save
monny
unless
it
was
neill
sheridan
and
he
was
discreet
enough
to
keep
his
feelings
to
himself
the
girl
was
not
she
protested
on
principle
although
she
had
the
asiut
address
but
where
all
men
black
and
brown
and
white
were
yelling
with
the
whole
force
of
their
lungs
and
pitching
and
tossing
luggage
mostly
the
wrong
luggage
with
all
the
force
of
their
arms
nobody
heard
or
cared
what
she
said
for
once
monny
gilder
was
disregarded
by
a
crowd
of
men
this
could
happen
only
at
the
departure
of
a
boat
train
but
if
i
was
not
thinking
about
her
i
was
thinking
about
her
fifteen
trunks
and
cleopatra
sixteen
and
biddy
and
miss
guest
two
the
maids
were
worse
than
useless
and
i
had
no
valet
i
have
never
had
a
valet
i
clawed
i
fought
i
wrestled
in
an
arena
where
it
was
impossible
to
tell
the
wild
beasts
from
the
martyrs
i
rescued
small
bags
from
under
big
boxes
and
dashed
off
with
a
few
samples
to
the
train
in
order
to
secure
places
all
other
men
including
sheridan
and
the
artist
sculptor
bailey
were
engaged
in
the
same
pursuit
and
our
plan
was
to
bag
a
whole
compartment
between
us
in
the
for
cairo
but
we
never
met
again
till
we
reached
our
destination
one
expects
egypt
to
warm
the
heart
with
its
weather
but
the
cold
was
bitter
so
was
the
disappointment
about
anthony
both
cut
through
me
like
knives
darkness
had
fallen
before
i
was
ready
to
join
the
ladies
if
i
could
in
passing
earlier
i
had
shouted
to
the
maids
where
to
find
the
places
grabbed
with
difficulty
for
their
mistresses
whether
they
had
found
them
or
whether
any
of
the
party
still
existed
was
the
next
question
and
it
was
settled
only
as
the
train
began
to
move
the
compartment
i
had
selected
was
boiling
over
with
a
south
american
president
and
his
effects
but
as
i
stood
transfixed
by
this
transformation
scene
cleopatra
maid
hailed
me
from
the
end
of
the
corridor
quatres
were
in
the
restaurant
car
why
ah
it
was
the
arab
they
had
engaged
as
dragoman
who
had
advised
the
change
in
milord
absence
he
said
it
would
be
better
as
of
course
they
would
want
dinner
he
himself
was
looking
after
the
small
except
the
little
sacks
of
the
hand
which
the
maids
kept
what
the
ladies
had
engaged
a
dragoman
and
they
had
trusted
him
a
stranger
with
luggage
then
it
was
as
good
as
gone
but
no
mildly
ventured
cleopatra
handmaiden
the
dragoman
came
recommended
he
had
a
letter
from
a
friend
of
milord
my
thoughts
jumped
of
course
to
anthony
yet
how
could
he
have
known
that
i
was
travelling
with
ladies
and
if
by
some
marconian
miracle
he
had
heard
why
should
he
who
prided
himself
on
not
bothering
with
women
trouble
to
provide
a
dragoman
at
alexandria
i
hurried
to
the
dining
car
and
found
monny
with
her
satellites
seated
at
a
table
three
of
them
looking
as
calmly
innocent
as
if
they
had
not
upset
my
scheme
for
their
comfort
biddy
alone
had
a
guilty
air
because
perhaps
i
was
more
important
in
her
eyes
than
in
the
eyes
of
the
others
oh
dear
duffer
she
began
to
wheedle
me
we
hope
you
do
mind
our
coming
here
we
thought
it
a
good
idea
for
we
starving
although
we
perfectly
happy
because
we
in
egypt
and
because
it
such
a
train
so
different
and
eastern
the
dragoman
who
i
think
he
came
from
your
friend
anthony
with
an
cleopatra
broke
in
he
seemed
providential
and
he
speaks
english
the
only
objection
is
he
not
as
as
monny
and
i
wanted
our
dragoman
to
be
we
did
hope
to
get
one
who
would
be
to
us
you
see
and
give
the
right
sort
of
eastern
background
but
i
suppose
one
ca
have
and
it
was
i
who
said
your
friend
anthony
messenger
must
be
engaged
even
if
his
face
is
is
rather
like
an
it
like
a
catastrophe
remarked
monny
looking
as
if
she
blamed
me
where
it
i
wanted
to
know
it
waiting
in
a
vestibule
outside
where
the
cook
cooking
biddy
explained
ungrammatically
i
told
it
you
want
to
see
it
and
got
a
letter
for
you
from
some
one
did
the
fellow
say
the
letter
was
from
fenton
i
inquired
no
he
only
said
from
a
friend
who
expected
to
meet
you
and
east
was
sure
it
must
be
from
the
one
you
were
talking
about
wasting
no
more
words
i
marched
off
to
the
fountainhead
for
information
near
the
open
door
of
the
infinitesimal
kitchen
stood
a
fat
little
dark
man
with
a
broken
nose
and
one
white
eye
the
other
eye
as
if
to
make
up
was
singularly
repellently
intelligent
it
fixed
itself
upon
me
as
i
approached
with
eager
questioning
which
melted
into
ingratiating
politeness
instinct
warned
the
fellow
that
i
was
the
person
he
awaited
at
the
same
moment
instinct
was
busily
whispering
to
me
that
there
was
something
fishy
about
him
despite
the
alleged
letter
he
did
not
look
the
type
of
man
fenton
would
recommend
and
though
his
face
was
of
an
unwholesome
olive
tint
and
he
wore
a
tarbush
and
a
galabeah
as
long
as
a
under
his
short
european
coat
i
was
sure
he
was
not
of
arab
or
egyptian
blood
milord
borrow
he
began
displaying
large
white
teeth
of
which
he
was
evidently
proud
i
assented
my
name
is
bedr
el
gemály
he
introduced
himself
i
have
a
letter
for
milord
who
gave
it
to
you
i
challenged
him
the
ingratiating
smile
seemed
to
flicker
like
a
candle
flame
in
a
sudden
puff
of
wind
a
friend
of
my
a
dragoman
he
could
not
come
to
bring
it
so
he
give
it
to
me
the
gentleman
name
was
fenton
my
friend
he
was
sent
from
him
at
cairo
as
the
fellow
spoke
in
fairly
good
english
he
took
from
a
pocket
of
the
short
coat
which
spoiled
his
costume
a
colourful
silk
handkerchief
unwrapping
this
he
produced
an
envelope
it
was
addressed
to
me
in
the
handwriting
of
fenton
but
before
opening
it
i
went
on
with
my
catechism
then
the
letter
does
introduce
you
but
your
friend
the
smile
was
practically
dead
now
i
think
it
do
not
introduce
any
ones
it
is
only
a
letter
my
friend
abdullah
engaged
to
carry
it
but
he
got
sick
too
soon
to
come
to
the
ship
i
see
said
i
you
seem
to
have
used
the
letter
however
to
get
yourself
taken
on
as
dragoman
by
the
ladies
of
my
party
how
the
devil
did
you
find
out
that
they
were
travelling
with
me
eh
i
shot
the
question
at
him
and
tried
to
imitate
gimlets
with
my
eyes
but
he
was
ready
with
his
answer
no
doubt
he
had
prepared
it
i
see
you
all
together
from
a
distant
place
before
i
come
there
a
gentleman
off
the
ship
he
pointed
you
out
when
i
ask
where
i
find
milord
borrow
i
see
you
and
those
ladies
when
i
come
you
was
away
already
so
i
speak
to
them
and
say
if
i
could
help
i
be
very
pleased
when
i
tell
one
of
the
ladies
i
was
from
a
friend
of
with
a
letter
she
say
is
the
friend
name
captain
fenton
and
i
say
madame
captain
fenton
that
is
the
name
and
i
am
a
dragoman
to
show
egypt
to
the
strangers
i
know
it
all
very
well
from
alexandria
way
up
nile
then
the
lady
say
very
quick
she
will
take
me
for
her
dragoman
i
am
pleased
for
i
was
not
engaged
for
season
and
she
say
if
i
satisfy
her
she
keep
me
in
cairo
and
on
from
there
h
i
grunted
still
screwing
in
the
gimlets
i
see
you
not
an
egyptian
you
have
selected
the
name
of
an
armenian
famous
in
history
are
you
armenian
i
am
the
same
thing
as
egyptian
i
bin
here
for
dragoman
so
many
years
i
am
mussulman
in
faith
but
i
was
born
armenian
he
admitted
you
speak
english
with
an
american
accent
i
went
on
have
you
lived
in
america
one
time
a
family
take
me
to
new
york
and
i
stay
a
year
or
two
then
i
get
homesick
and
come
to
egypt
again
but
i
learn
to
talk
maybe
some
like
american
peoples
while
i
am
over
there
it
sounded
plausible
enough
the
whole
story
and
if
east
had
snapped
the
dragoman
up
under
the
impression
that
he
came
from
a
man
she
had
determined
to
meet
the
fellow
might
be
no
more
to
blame
than
any
other
boaster
touting
in
his
own
interest
still
i
had
an
uneasy
feeling
that
something
lay
hidden
under
armenian
plausibility
bedr
el
gemály
was
perhaps
a
thief
who
had
courted
a
chance
for
a
big
haul
of
jewellery
yet
if
that
were
all
why
had
he
hopped
off
the
tram
as
it
began
to
move
with
the
ladies
hand
luggage
he
might
easily
have
got
away
and
disappeared
into
space
before
we
could
wire
the
police
of
alexandria
to
look
out
for
him
he
had
not
done
that
but
had
waited
and
risked
facing
my
suspicions
and
he
must
have
realized
while
in
charge
of
monny
and
cleopatra
attractive
dressing
bags
that
he
was
missing
an
opportunity
such
as
might
never
come
to
him
again
this
conduct
suggested
an
honest
desire
to
be
a
good
dragoman
yet
well
i
resolved
not
to
let
the
gimlets
rust
until
bedr
el
gemály
had
been
got
rid
of
if
east
had
really
promised
him
a
permanent
engagement
she
could
salve
his
disappointment
by
giving
him
a
pay
i
would
take
the
responsibility
of
sending
him
about
his
business
without
further
parley
i
opened
the
letter
it
was
short
evidently
written
in
a
hurry
anthony
had
scribbled
horribly
sorry
dear
old
duffer
but
i
wanted
by
the
powers
that
be
in
cairo
no
other
reason
could
have
kept
me
from
alexandria
i
was
afraid
a
wire
would
reach
you
so
i
sent
a
decent
old
chap
by
the
train
i
meant
to
take
he
pledged
to
find
you
on
the
quay
and
he
will
unless
some
one
makes
him
drunk
this
seems
unlikely
to
happen
as
he
wo
be
paid
till
he
gets
back
and
having
no
friends
on
earth
nobody
will
stand
him
drinks
beastly
luck
but
i
sha
be
able
to
see
you
even
in
cairo
tell
you
all
and
there
a
lot
to
tell
about
many
things
yours
ever
the
messenger
had
no
friend
on
earth
according
to
fenton
then
the
friendship
stated
to
exist
between
him
and
bedr
el
gemály
must
have
come
readymade
from
heaven
or
its
opposite
i
guessed
the
nature
of
the
decent
old
chap
illness
but
i
should
have
been
glad
to
know
whether
it
had
been
produced
by
design
or
accident
when
i
went
back
to
the
ladies
bedr
went
with
me
at
my
firm
suggestion
and
gave
them
their
handbags
to
use
as
footstools
dinner
was
ready
and
a
seat
had
been
kept
for
me
at
a
table
just
across
the
aisle
but
before
beginning
i
explained
the
real
circumstances
governing
the
dragoman
arrival
whatever
else
he
may
be
he
a
shark
i
said
or
he
would
have
traded
on
a
misunderstanding
to
grab
an
engagement
you
owe
him
nothing
really
but
if
you
choose
give
him
a
sovereign
when
we
get
to
cairo
and
i
tell
him
that
i
have
a
dragoman
in
view
for
the
party
he
then
have
two
days
pay
according
to
the
with
this
i
slipped
into
my
seat
thinking
the
matter
settled
but
between
courses
monny
leaned
across
from
her
table
she
and
i
had
end
seats
and
said
that
she
and
her
aunt
had
been
talking
about
that
poor
dragoman
aunt
clara
raised
his
hopes
the
girl
went
on
and
now
rachel
guest
and
i
think
it
would
be
mean
to
send
him
away
just
because
he
hideous
that
wo
be
the
reason
said
i
it
will
be
because
we
do
know
anything
about
him
and
because
in
his
sharpness
he
himself
but
we
do
know
things
about
him
he
showed
aunt
clara
letters
from
people
who
employed
him
lots
of
americans
whose
names
we
heard
and
some
we
acquainted
with
the
tragic
thing
is
that
he
finds
difficulty
in
getting
engaged
because
of
his
face
i
felt
guilty
ever
since
i
called
it
a
catastrophe
of
course
it
but
i
said
it
to
be
funny
which
was
cruel
and
we
deserve
to
punish
ourselves
by
keeping
the
poor
wretch
a
few
days
or
more
if
he
good
i
thought
you
wanted
a
becoming
dragoman
i
reminded
her
oh
that
was
just
our
silliness
i
like
people
i
must
say
but
what
it
matter
whether
a
brown
person
is
handsome
or
homely
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
besides
we
can
have
another
dragoman
too
for
ornament
if
we
run
across
a
very
picturesque
one
i
laughed
but
you
ca
go
up
the
nile
on
a
boat
with
a
drove
of
private
dragomans
you
know
i
know
lord
ernest
and
why
do
you
call
them
dragomen
you
make
them
sound
as
if
they
were
some
kind
of
animal
dragomans
is
the
plural
i
persisted
well
i
shall
call
them
dragomen
and
if
this
poor
thing
ca
get
any
one
else
to
drag
he
drag
us
up
the
nile
if
he
as
intelligent
in
his
ways
as
he
is
in
that
one
eye
which
is
so
like
a
egg
you
see
lord
ernest
we
going
to
have
a
boat
of
our
own
a
steam
dahabeah
is
what
we
want
so
we
wo
be
at
the
mercy
of
the
wind
and
we
can
have
all
the
dragomen
we
choose
ca
we
i
suppose
you
can
fill
up
your
cabins
with
them
i
agreed
because
i
felt
that
the
gilded
rose
wished
me
to
argue
the
point
and
that
if
i
did
i
should
be
worsted
as
i
should
not
be
on
board
the
dahabeah
in
question
it
would
not
matter
to
me
personally
if
the
boat
were
entirely
manned
by
dragomans
except
that
there
would
in
that
case
probably
be
a
collision
and
i
should
not
be
near
to
save
biddy
and
incidentally
the
girl
biddy
wished
me
to
marry
after
that
we
went
on
eating
our
dinner
and
talking
of
egypt
miss
guest
doing
all
the
listening
as
usual
when
we
had
finished
we
kept
our
places
because
we
had
no
others
cleopatra
was
curious
about
my
friend
failure
to
arrive
but
i
put
her
off
with
vaguenesses
and
said
to
myself
that
for
anthony
sake
it
was
well
that
mysterious
business
had
kept
him
in
cairo
still
i
wondered
what
the
business
was
why
he
would
be
unable
to
see
me
that
night
and
what
were
the
many
things
he
had
to
tell
chapter
iv
a
man
in
a
green
turban
i
shall
never
know
for
certain
whether
or
not
our
future
was
entirely
shaped
by
monny
resolve
to
breakfast
on
the
terrace
of
hotel
next
morning
a
great
many
remarkable
things
have
happened
on
that
historic
site
napoleon
made
the
place
his
headquarters
general
klèber
was
murdered
in
the
garden
half
the
most
important
people
in
the
world
have
had
tea
on
the
terrace
but
according
to
a
german
waiter
there
was
one
deed
yet
undone
nobody
had
ever
ordered
breakfast
out
of
doors
of
course
monny
got
what
she
wanted
not
by
storming
not
by
putting
on
airs
but
simply
by
turning
bright
pink
and
looking
at
once
that
waiter
rushed
off
and
fetched
other
waiters
and
almost
before
the
invited
guests
knew
what
to
expect
two
tables
had
been
fitted
together
covered
with
white
adorned
with
fresh
roses
and
set
forth
with
cups
and
saucers
i
was
the
one
man
invited
and
i
felt
like
an
actor
called
to
play
a
new
part
in
an
old
scene
a
scene
vaguely
excitingly
familiar
could
i
possibly
be
remembering
it
i
asked
myself
or
was
my
impression
but
the
result
of
a
debauch
of
egyptian
photographs
anyhow
there
was
the
impression
with
a
thrill
in
it
and
i
felt
that
i
ought
to
be
handsomer
more
romantic
altogether
more
vivid
if
i
were
to
live
up
to
the
moving
picture
it
seemed
as
if
nothing
would
be
too
extraordinary
to
do
if
i
wanted
to
match
my
surroundings
i
thought
even
if
i
burst
into
a
passionate
arab
and
proposed
to
monny
across
the
table
it
would
be
quite
the
right
note
but
somehow
i
did
feel
inclined
to
propose
it
was
enough
to
admire
her
over
the
rim
of
a
coffee
cup
in
her
white
tussore
i
heard
biddy
call
it
tussore
and
drooping
of
hat
she
was
a
different
girl
from
the
girl
of
the
ship
she
had
been
a
winter
girl
in
white
fur
then
now
she
was
a
summer
girl
and
a
radiant
vision
twice
as
pretty
as
before
especially
in
this
oriental
frame
still
i
was
waiting
to
see
myself
fall
in
love
with
her
much
in
the
same
way
that
biddy
was
waiting
and
there
was
that
oriental
frame
it
belonged
to
my
past
and
perhaps
monny
gilder
did
belong
even
to
my
future
so
it
was
excusable
if
i
thought
of
it
more
than
of
her
it
was
hardly
nine
but
already
the
wonderful
coloured
cinema
show
of
cairo
daily
life
had
begun
to
flash
and
flicker
past
the
terrace
of
shepheard
where
east
and
west
meet
and
mingle
more
sensationally
than
anywhere
in
egypt
nobody
save
ourselves
had
dared
suggest
breakfast
but
travellers
were
pouring
into
the
hotel
and
pouring
out
pretty
women
and
plain
women
were
sitting
at
the
little
wicker
tables
to
read
letters
or
discuss
plans
for
the
day
with
each
other
or
their
dragomans
officers
in
khaki
came
and
talked
to
them
about
golf
and
gymkhanas
down
on
the
pavement
close
under
the
balustrade
crowded
young
and
old
egyptian
men
with
dark
faces
and
wonderful
eyes
or
no
eyes
at
all
struggling
to
sell
painted
strings
of
mummy
beads
necklaces
of
cornelian
and
great
lumps
of
amber
fans
perfumes
sample
sticks
of
smoking
incense
toy
camels
cleverly
made
of
jute
fly
whisks
from
the
sudan
with

of

and
dangling
shells
scarab
rings
and
brooches
cheap
gay
jewellery
scarfs
from
asiut
white
black
pale
green
and
purple
glittering
like
miniature
cataracts
of
silver
as
brown

held
them
up
darting
arab

hawked
tame

or
shouted

in

of

round
their

withered

offered
oranges
or
immense
bunches
of

fresh
and

clanked

like

advertising

while

whispered
in
my
ears
the
arab
name
sherbétly
across
the
street
clear
sunshine
of
winter
in
egypt
shone
on
precious
stones
on
carved
ivories
silver
anklets
persian
rugs
and
embroideries
brilliant
as
hummingbirds
wings
all
displayed
in
the
windows
of
shops
where
dark
eyes
looked
out
eagerly
for
buyers
everything
was
for
sale
for
sale
to
the
strangers
the
whole
clamouring
city
seemed
to
consist
of
one
vast
concentrated
desire
on
the
part
of
brown
people
to
sell
things
to
fair
people
they
shouted
and
wheedled
and
besought
on
the
sidewalks
and
the
roadway
between
was
a
wide
river
of
colour
and
life
motor
cars
with
arab
chauffeurs
carried
rich
turks
to
business
or
to
an
audience
of
state
now
and
then
a
face
of
ivory
glimmered
through
a
gauzy
veil
and
eyes
of
ink
and
diamonds
shot
starry
glances
from
passing
carriage
windows
erect
english
women
drove
high
gordon
highlanders
swung
along
in
the
kilt
more
at
home
in
cairo
then
in
edinburgh
the
droning
of
their
pipes
as
oriental
as
the
drone
of
a
räita
or
the
beat
of
a
wedding
party
with
a
hidden
bride
in
a
yellow
chariot
met
a
funeral
and
yashmaked
faces
peeped
from
curtained
windows
in
one
procession
to
stare
at
the
wailing
marching
men
of
the
other
and
to
shrink
back
hastily
from
the
sight
of
the
coffin
tangled
it
would
seem
inextricably
with
streams
of
traffic
surging
both
ways
moved
the
ships
of
the
desert
loaded
with
bersím
long
lilting
necks
and
calm
mysterious
eyes
of
camels
high
above
the
cloaked
heads
of
striding
bedouins
heads
of
defiant
arab
prisoners
chained
and
handcuffed
to
each
other
heads
of
water
buffaloes
and
heads
of
trim
white
tasselled
donkeys
none
of
us
talked
very
much
as
we
sat
at
the
breakfast
table
the
novelty
and
wonder
of
the
scene
made
the
actors
forget
their
words
and
if
we
had
been
able
to
talk
we
could
not
have
appreciated
each
rhapsodies
over
the
shoutings
of
men
who
wanted
us
to
buy
their
wares
and
harangues
of
dragomans
who
wished
as
monny
said
to
drag
us
these
latter
especially
were
persistent
and
bedr
the
one
eyed
having
been
forbidden
to
come
till
ten
was
not
on
the
spot
to
give
protection
our
method
at
first
was
to
appear
oblivious
but
presently
in
my
wickedest
arabic
i
would
have
ordered
the
troop
away
if
monny
had
not
interfered
do
she
said
they
part
of
the
picture
besides
they
more
right
here
than
we
have
it
their
country
not
ours
and
they
so
interesting
most
of
them
that
tall
man
over
there
for
instance
with
the
green
turban
he
the
only
one
who
has
opened
his
mouth
just
to
show
him
that
virtue
its
own
reward
i
going
to
engage
him
will
you
call
him
to
us
please
lord
ernest
sitting
as
i
sat
i
could
not
see
the
person
indicated
what
do
you
want
him
for
miss
gilder
i
obeyed
temptation
and
asked
why
to
be
a
dragoman
of
course
she
explained
that
what
for
i
told
you
i
have
a
picturesque
one
for
ornament
this
creature
a
perfect
specimen
i
stood
up
reluctantly
and
looked
down
over
the
balustrade
a
man
with
a
green
turban
i
repeated
but
that
means
he
a
hadji
been
to
mecca
and
back
i
never
heard
of
a
dragoman
i
stopped
short
in
my
argument
my
eyes
had
found
the
man
with
the
green
turban
he
stood
at
some
distance
behind
the
and
dragomans
who
pressed
against
the
railing
in
his
long
galabeah
of
sudan
silk
ashes
of
roses
in
colour
he
was
tall
and
straight
as
a
palm
gravely
dignified
with
his
folded
arms
and
the
haughty
remoteness
of
his
expression
dark
and
silent
he
was
like
a
prince
compared
with
his
humbler
brethren
but
there
was
another
resemblance
more
relevant
and
intimate
which
cut
my
sentence
short
by
jove
i
thought
how
like
he
is
to
anthony
fenton
he
was
looking
not
at
me
but
at
miss
gilder
quite
respectfully
yet
hypnotically
as
if
by
way
of
an
experiment
he
had
been
willing
her
to
find
and
single
out
the
one
motionless
figure
the
one
person
whose
tongue
had
not
called
attention
to
himself
yes
i
thought
again
he
was
an
arab
copy
of
anthony
but
more
as
anthony
had
been
years
ago
before
his
moustache
grew
than
as
anthony
had
become
in
late
years
still
there
were
the
aquiline
features
the
long
rather
sad
eyes
shaded
with
thick
straight
lashes
the
eyebrows
raised
at
the
bridge
of
the
thin
nose
then
sloping
steeply
down
toward
the
temples
the
slight
working
of
muscles
in
the
cheeks
the
peculiarly
charming
mouth
which
could
be
irresistible
in
a
smile
the
stern
contradictory
chin
marring
by
its
prominence
the
otherwise
perfect
oval
of
the
face
i
wondered
if
anthony
had
as
noble
a
throat
as
this
collarless
galabeah
left
uncovered
reminding
myself
that
i
could
not
at
all
recall
anthony
throat
then
as
the
sombre
eyes
turned
to
me
drawn
perhaps
by
my
stare
i
was
stunned
flabbergasted
what
you
will
by
realizing
that
anthony
himself
was
looking
at
me
from
under
the
green
turban
the
dark
face
was
blankly
expressionless
he
might
have
been
gazing
through
my
head
his
eyes
neither
twinkled
with
fun
nor
sent
a
message
of
warning
but
somehow
i
knew
that
he
saw
me
that
he
had
been
watching
me
for
a
long
time
you
see
the
one
i
mean
do
you
asked
monny
well
that
the
one
i
want
i
take
she
spoke
as
if
she
were
selecting
a
horse
at
a
horse
show
anthony
had
brought
this
on
himself
but
i
was
not
angry
with
anthony
i
was
angry
with
the
girl
for
putting
her
finger
into
our
pie
that
not
a
dragoman
i
assured
her
if
he
were
he
come
and
bawl
out
his
accomplishments
as
the
others
do
he
a
very
different
sort
of
chap
that
why
i
want
him
said
monny
and
if
he
is
a
dragoman
jump
at
being
one
if
i
offer
to
pay
him
enough
he
an
egyptian
anyhow
by
his
clothes
or
a
bedouin
or
something
although
he
is
as
dark
as
the
rest
of
these
men
i
suppose
he
must
know
a
little
about
his
own
city
and
country
it
does
follow
he
tell
travellers
about
them
for
money
said
i
he
looks
to
me
a
man
of
good
birth
and
distinction
in
old
fashioned
dress
why
he
lingering
on
the
pavement
in
front
of
this
hotel
i
ca
explain
but
i
certain
he
is
touting
probably
he
waiting
for
a
friend
he
the
best
looking
arab
we
seen
yet
remarked
east
like
my
idea
of
an
egyptian
gentleman
pooh
said
monny
just
test
him
lord
ernest
sorry
but
i
ca
do
it
i
answered
with
a
firmness
which
ought
to
have
been
tried
on
her
long
ago
and
i
would
discuss
him
in
such
a
loud
tone
of
voice
he
may
understand
english
we
have
to
yell
to
hear
ourselves
speak
over
all
this
row
biddy
apologized
for
her
darling
but
she
need
not
have
troubled
herself
miss
gilder
had
been
deaf
to
my
implied
reproach
i
glad
i
an
american
girl
she
said
when
i
want
things
i
want
them
so
dreadfully
i
just
go
for
them
and
surprise
them
so
much
that
i
get
them
before
they
know
where
they
are
now
i
going
for
this
dragoman
he
not
a
drag
i
persisted
but
she
cut
me
short
i
bet
you
my
hat
he
will
be
one
what
will
you
bet
that
he
wo
lord
ernest
i
bet
you
his
green
turban
said
i
how
can
you
get
it
as
easily
as
you
can
get
him
i
retorted
it
a
safe
bet
monny
looked
excited
but
firm
luckily
as
she
does
it
so
often
becoming
to
her
to
look
firm
i
have
noticed
that
it
not
becoming
to
most
girls
it
squares
their
jaws
and
makes
their
eyes
snap
but
the
spoiled
daughter
of
the
dead
cannon
king
at
her
worst
merely
looks
pathetically
earnest
and
this
i
suppose
is
one
of
the
little
ways
she
has
acquired
since
she
gave
up
kicking
and
screaming
people
into
submission
as
biddy
says
the
girl
can
be
charming
not
only
when
she
wants
to
be
but
quite
often
when
she
does
the
man
with
the
green
turban
was
no
longer
engaged
in
hypnotizing
he
had
retired
within
himself
and
appeared
oblivious
to
the
outer
world
yet
nobody
jostled
the
tall
straight
figure
which
stood
with
folded
arms
lightly
leaning
against
a
tree
the
colour
of
his
turban
was
sacred
in
the
eyes
of
the
crowd
and
when
miss
gilder
leaning
over
the
terrace
railing
beckoned
him
surprise
rather
than
jealousy
showed
on
the
faces
of
the
unwanted
dragomans
as
for
the
wearer
of
the
turban
he
did
what
i
expected
and
wished
him
to
do
paid
not
the
slightest
attention
to
the
gesture
whatever
the
motive
for
his
masquerade
it
was
not
to
attract
anything
feminine
i
smiled
sardonically
that
a
nice
hat
you
got
on
miss
gilder
i
remarked
do
you
collect
girls
hats
she
asked
sweetly
but
mine
eligible
yet
for
your
collection
let
me
see
what
did
you
say
he
was
oh
a
hadji
and
she
shrilled
forth
sweetly
her
voice
sounding
young
and
clear
hadji
hadji
effendi
venez
ici
vous
plait
please
come
here
i
could
have
been
knocked
flat
by
a
blow
of
the
smallest
cheapest
ostrich
feather
in
the
hands
of
any
for
he
came
anthony
came
not
to
look
meekly
up
from
the
pavement
below
the
railing
but
to
ascend
the
steps
of
the
terrace
and
advance
with
grave
dignity
toward
our
table
within
a
yard
of
us
he
stopped
giving
to
me
not
to
miss
gilder
the
beautiful
arab
salute
a
touch
on
forehead
and
heart
you
devil
i
was
saying
to
myself
so
you
walk
into
this
trap
do
you
and
calmly
trust
me
to
get
you
out
serve
you
right
if
i
move
hand
or
foot
and
i
almost
made
up
my
mind
that
i
would
but
i
was
interested
i
wanted
intensely
to
know
what
the
dickens
anthony
was
up
to
and
whether
he
would
have
been
up
to
it
if
he
known
the
sort
of
young
woman
he
had
to
deal
with
it
was
i
who
called
to
you
not
this
gentleman
said
monny
when
she
found
that
green
turban
did
not
look
at
her
do
you
speak
french
or
english
a
little
a
little
of
both
but
i
choose
french
when
talking
to
americans
replied
anthony
fenton
with
astounding
impertinence
in
the
preferred
language
i
do
not
know
you
madame
but
i
do
know
this
gentleman
good
heavens
what
next
he
acknowledged
me
what
was
i
to
do
now
what
did
the
impudent
fellow
want
me
to
do
evidently
he
was
trying
an
experiment
anthony
is
great
on
experiments
and
always
has
been
but
this
was
a
bomb
i
thought
he
wanted
to
see
if
i
could
catch
it
on
the
fly
and
drop
it
into
water
before
it
had
time
to
explode
why
did
you
tell
us
lord
ernest
asked
monny
with
a
flash
in
her
gray
eyes
i
thought
you
had
been
in
egypt
since
you
were
a
child
i
have
and
i
did
recognize
him
at
first
i
answered
trying
for
the
coolness
which
anthony
dared
to
count
upon
you
remember
me
now
he
inquired
politely
i
er
yes
i
replied
also
in
french
your
face
is
familiar
though
you
changed
i
think
since
er
since
you
were
in
england
it
must
have
been
there
yes
of
course
you
were
on
a
diplomatic
mission
but
your
name
you
may
have
known
me
as
ahmed
antoun
said
the
wretch
not
dreaming
of
that
slip
he
had
made
cleopatra
who
has
little
french
nevertheless
started
and
fixed
upon
the
face
under
the
turban
a
stare
of
feverish
interest
brigit
and
the
unobtrusive
lady
with
the
slanting
eyes
both
showed
such
symptoms
of
surprise
as
must
too
late
have
warned
fenton
that
he
had
missed
his
footing
skating
on
thin
ice
antoun
exclaimed
east
why
that
what
you
said
you
called
your
friend
captain
fenton
i
glanced
at
anthony
his
profile
had
no
more
expression
than
that
of
an
indian
on
an
american
penny
and
indeed
rather
resembled
it
if
he
were
blaming
me
for
letting
anything
out
i
had
a
right
to
blame
him
for
letting
himself
in
he
was
silent
as
well
as
expressionless
he
left
it
all
to
me
diplomat
or
duffer
effendi
was
the
nickname
my
friend
fenton
got
at
school
i
explained
to
cleopatra
because
it
sounded
a
bit
like
his
own
name
and
because
he
had
er
because
he
had
associations
with
egypt
he
was
proud
of
them
and
is
still
but
antoun
is
a
name
often
heard
here
and
every
man
who
is
a
bey
or
a
prince
or
a
sheikh
is
an
effendi
i
quite
remember
you
now
i
hurried
on
turning
to
anthony
once
more
you
are
hadji
as
well
as
effendi
i
have
the
right
to
call
myself
so
if
i
choose
he
admitted
i
am
pleased
to
meet
you
again
i
was
waiting
for
a
friend
when
you
beckoned
if
you
did
not
recognize
my
face
at
first
may
i
ask
what
it
was
you
wanted
of
me
there
was
no
limit
then
to
his
audacity
he
had
not
learned
his
lesson
yet
after
all
it
would
seem
monny
could
not
bear
tamely
to
lose
her
hat
though
she
must
have
felt
her
hatpins
trembling
in
the
balance
i
told
you
before
she
repeated
that
it
was
i
who
beckoned
you
he
looked
at
her
without
speaking
and
somehow
the
green
turban
and
the
long
straight
gown
by
adding
to
his
dignity
added
also
to
his
remote
air
of
cold
politeness
how
could
she
go
on
had
she
the
cheek
to
go
on
she
had
but
the
cheek
was
flushed
with
embarrassment
i
er
i
am
anxious
for
a
guide
some
one
who
knows
egypt
well
and
several
languages
she
desperately
blurted
out
looking
like
a
child
i
thought
there
are
plenty
of
dragomans
madame
green
turban
reminded
her
i
can
recommend
you
several
i
do
want
a
regular
dragoman
she
said
and
i
not
i
am
miss
gilder
indeed
chilling
indifference
in
the
tone
monny
hat
was
practically
mine
i
thought
i
should
rather
value
it
yes
but
of
course
that
ca
matter
to
you
no
it
can
not
mademoiselle
what
i
want
to
say
is
this
you
a
hadji
which
means
you
been
to
mecca
lord
ernest
borrow
just
told
us
so
you
must
be
very
intelligent
are
you
in
business
i
am
interested
in
excavations
oh
and
are
you
allowed
to
make
them
yourself
not
always
i
glanced
at
him
quickly
wondering
if
he
meant
that
answer
more
for
me
than
for
the
girl
but
his
face
told
nothing
would
you
be
able
to
if
you
were
rich
enough
it
is
possible
well
i
be
willing
to
give
you
a
big
salary
for
showing
us
about
cairo
and
perhaps
going
up
the
nile
you
do
not
know
who
i
am
mademoiselle
ask
your
friend
lord
ernest
borrow
perhaps
he
may
remember
something
about
my
circumstances
now
he
has
recalled
my
face
i
was
honestly
not
sure
whether
this
were
further
deviltry
or
an
appeal
for
help
in
any
case
i
thought
it
time
for
the
scene
to
end
i
told
you
i
said
to
monny
in
english
that
he
was
a
man
of
importance
not
at
all
the
sort
of
person
you
could
expect
to
engage
for
a
guide
you
must
see
now
that
he
a
gentleman
and
a
a
an
egyptian
gentleman
is
just
the
same
as
any
other
surely
not
quite
she
answered
in
the
same
language
and
i
realized
my
foolish
mistake
in
using
it
as
if
i
meant
her
to
understand
that
antoun
effendi
knew
it
too
little
to
catch
our
secrets
an
egyptian
man
ca
have
the
same
feelings
as
a
european
why
for
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
years
they
been
an
enslaved
race
like
our
black
people
at
home
we
never
think
of
calling
even
the
fairest
quadroon
man
a
gentleman
though
he
might
be
wonderfully
good
looking
and
nice
mannered
literally
i
was
frightened
anthony
fenton
is
fiercely
devoted
to
the
memory
of
the
beautiful
for
love
of
whom
his
career
was
ruined
mother
was
a
sicilian
woman
and
her
father
was
half
greek
so
there
is
little
enough
egyptian
blood
after
all
in
the
veins
of
general
fenton
son
he
is
proud
of
what
there
is
proud
because
of
his
mother
fatal
charm
and
the
romance
of
her
story
it
was
on
the
eve
of
her
wedding
with
a
cousin
of
the
sultan
that
the
famous
soldier
charles
fenton
ran
away
with
princess
lalla
and
married
her
in
sicily
but
he
is
sensitive
too
because
great
name
as
charles
fenton
had
made
in
egypt
he
was
asked
to
resign
his
commission
on
account
of
the
escapade
anthony
sent
to
england
to
a
public
school
had
fought
bigger
boys
than
himself
who
in
a
certain
tone
had
sneeringly
called
him
egyptian
i
imagined
now
that
through
the
dark
stain
on
his
face
i
could
see
him
turn
pale
with
rage
he
thought
perhaps
that
the
american
beauty
was
revenging
herself
for
his
impertinence
and
maybe
he
was
right
but
that
did
not
excuse
her
be
careful
miss
gilder
i
warned
the
girl
this
man
understands
english
better
than
you
think
he
comes
of
a
princely
family
and
got
only
to
put
out
his
hand
to
claim
a
fortune
you
seem
to
remember
all
about
me
now
lord
ernest
broke
in
fenton
looking
dangerous
yes
i
said
it
comes
back
to
me
you
must
forgive
miss
gilder
there
is
nothing
to
forgive
he
caught
me
up
i
am
not
a
dragoman
to
be
sure
but
i
enough
of
an
egyptian
to
have
a
price
for
anything
i
do
i
may
put
myself
at
this
lady
service
if
she
will
pay
my
price
though
i
not
a
servant
and
ca
accept
wages
even
for
the
sake
of
pursuing
my
excavations
he
continued
to
speak
in
french
lest
my
companions
suspicions
should
be
further
roused
by
the
english
of
an
englishman
and
monny
pale
after
her
blush
answered
in
neat
schoolgirl
french
with
a
pretty
american
accent
what
the
price
you
wish
to
name
she
inquired
looking
a
little
afraid
of
him
and
ashamed
of
herself
now
that
talk
of
princes
and
fortunes
was
bandied
about
of
course
she
went
on
when
he
did
not
answer
at
once
if
i
known
all
this
i
should
have
asked
you
to
be
a
dragoman
at
least
perhaps
i
should
anyhow
i
should
have
made
a
bet
a
bet
that
i
would
have
a
mademoiselle
then
you
may
win
your
bet
for
i
just
told
you
i
have
a
price
but
i
think
it
unlikely
you
would
be
willing
to
pay
it
good
heavens
is
he
going
to
try
and
marry
the
girl
i
asked
myself
it
would
be
the
last
thing
to
expect
of
anthony
fenton
however
he
had
already
done
the
last
but
one
the
thing
i
had
bet
his
green
turban
he
would
not
do
after
all
he
was
a
man
and
a
reckless
man
as
he
had
proved
on
more
than
one
wild
occasion
he
was
in
a
strange
mood
capable
of
anything
and
the
gilded
rose
could
never
have
been
prettier
in
her
life
than
at
this
minute
she
had
made
him
furious
and
i
had
imagined
that
his
acceptance
of
her
overtures
was
the
beginning
of
some
scheme
of
punishment
now
i
was
almost
sure
i
had
been
right
yet
i
could
not
guess
what
he
would
be
at
neither
could
monny
but
here
was
the
dangerously
picturesque
arab
who
must
be
a
prince
or
something
as
cleopatra
had
expressed
it
and
he
was
even
more
dangerous
than
picturesque
you
you
said
you
would
take
wages
she
stammered
i
enjoyed
hearing
the
young
person
stammer
so
i
ca
understand
what
you
mean
but
even
though
you
are
all
those
things
lord
ernest
says
you
are
your
price
ca
be
so
terribly
high
as
to
be
beyond
my
power
to
pay
if
i
choose
to
pay
first
mademoiselle
i
must
decide
whether
i
choose
to
be
paid
oh
monny
exclaimed
taken
aback
i
thought
it
was
a
question
of
price
not
only
that
put
myself
at
the
lady
service
for
a
price
was
what
i
said
i
did
say
will
i
shall
not
be
able
to
tell
you
until
the
patronizing
tone
in
which
anthony
spoke
this
sentence
was
worth
to
me
everything
i
had
gone
through
in
the
last
half
hour
but
i
want
to
settle
things
this
morning
or
not
at
all
said
monny
reverting
to
type
that
of
the
spoiled
child
i
am
sorry
replied
the
man
of
the
green
turban
in
that
case
it
must
be
not
at
all
and
he
made
as
if
to
go
the
gilded
girl
could
not
bear
this
i
and
the
others
would
see
that
she
was
fallible
that
there
were
things
she
wanted
which
she
could
not
get
why
ca
you
tell
me
now
what
your
price
is
she
persisted
because
mademoiselle
i
may
not
need
to
tell
you
ever
it
depends
partly
on
another
than
myself
he
threw
a
quick
glance
at
me
i
expect
to
meet
that
other
at
abdullahi
café
in
an
hour
from
now
at
latest
everything
will
depend
on
the
interview
in
any
case
i
will
let
you
know
what
i
can
do
i
may
not
be
in
said
monny
but
if
i
out
you
can
leave
a
note
if
i
must
refuse
to
serve
you
yes
i
can
leave
a
note
if
i
am
to
accept
i
must
see
you
in
person
should
you
be
out
i
take
it
for
granted
that
you
have
changed
your
mind
and
do
not
want
he
smiled
faintly
for
the
first
time
so
expensive
a
guide
monny
hesitated
i
am
not
stingy
i
stay
at
home
this
evening
she
volunteered
at
last
bravo
petruchio
i
said
under
my
breath
but
if
biddy
plot
were
to
succeed
it
was
business
to
play
the
part
of
petruchio
to
this
katherine
let
the
masquerading
prince
find
a
desdemona
who
would
suit
his
othello
chapter
v
the
café
of
abdullah
well
you
got
away
from
them
all
right
began
the
man
with
the
green
turban
when
according
to
his
roundabout
instructions
i
met
him
an
hour
later
at
the
café
he
had
named
one
of
the
principal
resorts
of
cairo
where
europeans
can
consort
with
natives
without
attracting
remark
the
real
dragoman
came
and
took
them
off
my
hands
at
least
the
realer
one
than
you
a
dreadful
creature
with
a
game
eye
who
murdered
your
messenger
last
night
and
gave
me
your
letter
and
induced
the
ladies
to
engage
him
on
the
strength
of
it
no
wonder
they
want
a
to
take
the
taste
of
him
out
of
their
mouths
and
you
certainly
are
a
in
that
now
kindly
tell
me
all
about
it
and
everything
else
that
what
i
here
for
said
anthony
running
a
to
earth
in
some
mysterious
arab
pocket
but
hold
on
duffer
something
you
said
just
then
may
be
important
is
it
true
that
my
messenger
give
you
the
letter
if
you
hung
about
shepheard
hotel
ten
minutes
longer
you
have
seen
the
fellow
who
did
give
it
bedr
el
gemály
he
calls
himself
armenian
mussulman
a
sickening
combination
and
an
awful
brute
to
look
at
said
your
messenger
was
taken
suddenly
ill
pretends
to
be
a
dragoman
what
is
he
like
rather
like
a
partially
decayed
but
decently
dressed
goat
do
rot
this
may
be
serious
i
described
bedr
el
gemály
as
best
i
could
feature
by
feature
when
i
had
polished
them
off
anthony
shook
his
head
no
portrait
of
him
in
my
rogues
gallery
just
now
i
sensitive
about
spies
rather
of
course
you
spotted
my
game
i
confess
i
was
conceited
enough
to
think
you
given
yourself
all
this
trouble
with
the
costumier
in
order
to
take
a
rise
out
of
me
but
when
you
speak
of
spies
i
begin
to
put
two
and
two
together
your
business
in
cairo
the
powers
that
be
keeping
you
from
me
last
night
etc
i
suppose
it
an
official
job
this
fancy
dress
affair
yes
in
my
own
capacity
i
not
in
cairo
i
turned
up
day
before
yesterday
jolly
glad
to
get
back
from
adrianople
though
it
was
good
fun
there
i
can
tell
you
for
a
while
and
i
looked
forward
to
wallowing
no
end
in
the
alleged
delights
of
civilization
i
reported
myself
and
all
seemed
well
i
took
a
room
at
shepheard
where
you
and
i
had
arranged
to
meet
and
when
i
scrubbed
i
strolled
over
to
the
turf
club
to
see
what
the
gay
world
would
have
to
say
to
a
fellow
in
disgrace
only
silly
asses
swallowed
that
newspaper
spoof
every
one
in
london
who
knows
anything
about
you
was
betting
his
boots
that
the
story
had
been
spread
on
purpose
to
save
our
face
with
turkey
i
could
resist
interrupting
his
narrative
to
this
extent
but
anthony
merely
smiled
and
watched
a
smokering
settle
like
a
halo
over
the
head
of
an
arab
at
the
nearest
table
he
was
not
giving
away
official
secrets
but
i
was
sure
and
always
had
been
sure
that
he
was
a
martyr
not
a
rebel
in
the
matter
of
the
balkan
incident
just
closed
what
the
public
were
led
to
suppose
was
this
that
captain
fenton
had
asked
for
two
months
leave
from
regimental
duty
at
khartum
in
order
to
spend
the
time
with
a
relative
who
was
seriously
ill
in
constantinople
that
instead
of
remaining
at
his
relative
bedside
he
had
used
his
leave
for
a
dash
to
the
balkans
that
this
indiscretion
might
have
been
kept
a
secret
had
he
not
capped
it
with
another
a
flight
with
a
greek
officer
in
an
army
aeroplane
which
had
ended
by
crashing
down
in
the
midst
of
a
turkish
encampment
what
i
and
friends
who
knew
him
best
supposed
was
that
the
leave
had
been
a
pretext
that
fenton
had
been
sent
on
a
secret
mission
of
some
sort
and
that
he
was
bound
to
take
the
blame
if
anything
went
wrong
aeroplanes
have
the
habits
of
other
fierce
untamed
animals
they
always
obey
their
trainers
thus
anthony
and
his
plan
had
both
been
upset
or
had
it
really
been
premeditated
that
he
should
fall
into
that
camp
the
remainder
of
his
leave
was
cancelled
in
punishment
and
he
had
been
recalled
to
egypt
to
be
scolded
in
cairo
before
proceeding
to
khartum
queer
how
many
silly
asses
one
knows
anthony
said
still
considering
what
a
mess
i
seem
to
have
made
of
things
fellows
were
jolly
kind
at
the
turf
club
nobody
cut
me
and
only
a
few
let
me
alone
maybe
there
have
been
still
fewer
if
there
had
been
a
hero
present
who
claimed
attention
an
american
chap
jack
dennis
who
knows
miss
gilder
and
was
telling
the
good
news
that
she
was
on
her
way
to
egypt
he
called
her
the
gilded
rose
and
said
it
was
going
to
be
a
good
flower
season
in
cairo
and
up
the
nile
all
the
men
with
one
exception
seemed
to
have
heard
a
lot
about
her
and
to
find
her
an
interesting
subject
and
to
want
dennis
to
introduce
them
i
can
guess
the
exception
said
i
can
you
well
i
do
read
newspaper
gossip
about
heiresses
thank
heaven
i
something
better
to
do
with
my
time
but
the
others
wanted
to
meet
her
or
pretended
to
perhaps
to
chaff
dennis
rather
a
cocky
youth
though
i
ought
to
say
so
as
he
was
nice
to
me
according
to
his
lights
he
got
sam
blake
to
introduce
us
when
he
happened
to
hear
my
name
and
went
out
of
his
way
to
pay
me
compliments
which
i
daresay
he
thought
i
like
when
there
was
a
lull
in
the
discussion
of
what
could
be
done
to
make
miss
gilder
enjoy
herself
in
egypt
chaps
suggesting
trips
in
their
motor
cars
or
on
their
camels
and
a
lot
of
rot
dennis
remarked
that
i
was
the
only
man
who
had
chipped
into
the
conversation
and
had
i
any
ideas
for
entertaining
the
golden
girl
naturally
i
said
that
i
did
know
who
she
was
and
had
never
heard
of
her
and
even
if
i
had
entertaining
girls
was
in
my
line
they
all
roared
and
dennis
would
believe
at
first
that
i
know
of
such
an
important
person
existence
but
the
other
men
rotted
a
bit
and
described
me
to
him
according
to
their
notions
of
me
so
he
let
me
alone
on
the
subject
and
having
plenty
of
other
things
to
think
of
i
forgot
all
about
it
till
the
lady
in
question
introduced
herself
this
morning
then
well
it
struck
me
as
rather
amusing
at
first
that
i
the
only
one
in
the
crowd
who
had
made
plans
to
get
at
her
should
have
her
trying
to
get
at
me
that
was
partly
why
i
came
up
on
the
terrace
when
she
beckoned
partly
for
purely
intellectual
reasons
i
curious
to
know
the
rest
i
suppose
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
her
looks
as
it
happened
my
cynical
friend
it
had
i
got
eyes
in
my
head
and
i
could
see
she
was
pretty
very
pretty
though
not
my
ideal
type
at
all
that
little
sprite
of
a
woman
in
fawn
colour
the
one
with
green
eyes
and
a
lot
of
black
lashes
is
more
what
i
fall
in
love
with
if
i
were
frivolous
but
apart
from
the
funny
side
of
my
meeting
with
miss
golder
or
gilder
it
popped
into
my
head
that
i
might
make
her
a
victim
in
a
certain
cause
do
ask
me
to
explain
yet
because
there
are
a
lot
of
things
that
have
got
to
be
explained
first
or
you
could
understand
you
were
right
of
course
when
you
thought
stationed
myself
in
front
of
shepheard
to
take
a
rise
out
of
you
i
gave
up
my
room
there
yesterday
for
reasons
i
tell
you
but
i
knew
you
be
in
the
hotel
and
that
you
be
bound
to
show
yourself
on
the
terrace
in
order
to
go
out
i
wanted
to
see
if
you
recognize
me
and
to
have
a
little
fun
with
you
if
you
did
by
the
way
i
not
pleased
that
you
did
it
a
poor
compliment
to
my
which
i
may
tell
you
has
been
warmly
praised
in
high
quarters
well
you
see
i
apologized
i
knew
you
were
a
nailer
at
that
sort
of
thing
or
you
would
never
have
got
to
mecca
and
earned
your
green
turban
i
knew
you
been
pretty
often
called
upon
to
disguise
yourself
and
go
about
among
the
natives
for
one
thing
or
another
and
besides
we
were
chums
before
you
had
the
shadow
of
a
moustache
so
i
have
an
advantage
over
the
other
sherlock
holmeses
but
even
as
it
was
i
could
be
sure
at
first
you
must
have
got
some
fun
out
of
my
expression
i
did
i
took
revenge
on
you
for
recognizing
me
by
tormenting
you
as
far
as
i
dared
dear
old
boy
i
knew
you
see
me
through
to
the
end
bitter
or
sweet
which
was
it
i
inquired
mixed
the
girl
riled
me
rather
so
much
so
that
i
definitely
decided
it
would
be
fair
play
to
make
use
of
her
as
a
but
it
depends
on
you
whether
she
to
lose
or
win
her
bet
if
she
loses
i
get
her
hat
if
she
wins
i
engaged
myself
to
procure
for
her
your
green
turban
did
you
think
you
could
without
my
consent
no
i
distinctly
thought
i
could
but
i
would
have
been
willing
to
bet
the
head
in
the
turban
served
up
on
a
charger
so
sure
i
was
that
you
refuse
to
come
near
her
i
thought
i
knew
you
you
see
you
do
i
have
changed
but
circumstances
have
changed
and
that
brings
me
near
to
the
stage
of
this
business
which
concerns
you
and
me
first
before
i
go
further
though
i
tell
you
a
part
of
the
reason
why
i
sporting
the
green
turban
there
been
the
dickens
to
pay
here
about
a
new
street
that
had
to
be
made
an
immensely
important
and
necessary
street
well
they
could
make
it
because
the
tomb
of
a
popular
saint
or
sheikh
was
in
the
way
to
move
the
body
or
even
disturb
a
saint
tomb
would
mean
no
end
of
a
row
you
remember
or
have
read
enough
about
mohammedans
to
know
that
what
to
do
was
the
question
nobody
been
able
to
answer
it
till
yesterday
when
the
sight
of
me
reminded
them
of
a
trick
or
two
i
brought
off
some
time
ago
by
disguising
myself
and
hanging
about
the
cafés
they
wanted
me
to
try
it
again
consequently
captain
fenton
received
a
telegram
and
had
to
leave
cairo
at
once
on
business
he
gave
up
his
room
at
shepheard
and
the
only
regrettable
thing
to
the
official
mind
is
that
the
fellow
been
seen
about
town
even
for
an
hour
however
it
could
be
helped
luckily
ahmed
antoun
is
not
unknown
in
cairo
cafés
he
made
quite
an
impression
upon
the
public
on
several
occasions
since
his
pilgrimage
to
mecca
two
years
ago
and
since
yesterday
afternoon
he
been
drinking
enough
coffee
to
give
him
jaundice
while
casually
spreading
the
story
of
a
dream
he
had
our
friend
the
hadji
related
how
he
had
slept
in
the
mosque
of
ibn
tulun
after
the
noon
hour
and
dreamed
of
the
sheikh
whose
tomb
is
so
inconveniently
placed
in
the
dream
the
saint
clamoured
to
have
his
tomb
moved
on
account
of
a
bad
smell
of
drainage
which
he
considers
an
insult
to
his
own
memory
also
dogs
have
taken
to
howling
round
his
at
night
and
you
know
that
to
the
true
believer
a
dog
is
an
unclean
animal
except
for
hunting
purposes
or
in
various
branches
good
mohammedans
class
dogs
and
christians
together
in
their
mind
well
already
the
hadji
dream
is
working
like
yeast
the
news
of
it
is
being
carried
from
one
café
to
another
and
i
hope
that
a
few
more
nights
work
will
do
the
trick
the
votaries
of
the
saint
will
get
up
a
petition
to
have
his
body
moved
when
it
has
found
another
abode
the
making
of
the
new
thoroughfare
will
be
suggested
very
neat
i
see
it
all
except
the
connection
with
miss
gilder
what
has
your
saint
got
to
do
with
her
very
little
i
should
say
by
the
look
in
her
eyes
but
though
a
green
turban
as
good
as
an
heirloom
and
extorts
respect
wherever
it
goes
even
a
hadji
may
have
jealous
detractors
i
have
mine
another
green
turban
in
this
town
whose
genuineness
is
doubted
for
some
obscure
reason
or
other
has
sneered
at
my
dream
i
say
that
sounds
as
if
you
might
be
in
danger
if
one
man
suspects
you
oh
it
only
the
dream
he
suspects
at
present
i
know
all
the
little
prayer
tricks
so
well
and
i
invented
my
own
history
so
ingeniously
with
a
to
match
my
province
that
i
shall
get
through
this
incident
as
i
have
through
others
of
the
sort
there
only
one
hole
in
my
jebbah
last
night
when
my
rival
sprang
a
sudden
question
as
to
what
i
was
doing
in
cairo
i
supposed
to
be
a
luxor
man
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
i
replied
that
i
was
acting
as
dragoman
to
a
rich
family
of
tourists
on
that
the
brute
inquired
with
honeyed
accents
where
they
were
staying
i
said
shepheard
because
i
expected
you
to
be
there
and
thought
if
i
were
followed
you
might
be
useful
as
a
dummy
ah
that
where
miss
gilder
comes
in
a
gilded
gingerbread
lamb
ready
for
the
sacrifice
why
did
you
accept
her
offer
at
once
as
she
seemed
so
providential
i
coming
to
that
it
sounds
complicated
but
it
is
for
one
thing
though
it
may
be
well
to
wait
and
find
out
a
little
more
about
that
armenian
of
yours
he
is
mine
he
i
want
to
know
for
certain
whose
he
is
if
he
has
anything
to
do
with
my
rival
hadji
there
more
venom
and
wit
inside
that
green
turban
than
i
given
it
credit
for
is
there
a
reason
by
the
way
except
their
riches
why
one
should
want
to
at
a
member
of
the
american
party
by
jove
said
i
as
if
i
had
been
pinched
for
there
was
a
sharp
nip
in
the
thought
anthony
question
jabbed
into
my
mind
i
had
disliked
and
distrusted
bedr
el
gemály
but
i
had
associated
my
distaste
for
him
with
fenton
affairs
it
had
not
occurred
to
me
that
biddy
fears
meant
more
than
a
nervous
woman
vague
forebodings
during
the
few
hideous
years
of
she
had
passed
in
trying
to
protect
the
traitor
richard
she
had
no
doubt
had
real
enough
reason
to
dread
a
spy
in
every
stranger
but
i
had
cheerfully
advised
her
not
to
be
morbid
when
she
spoke
of
herself
as
a
dangerous
companion
or
stopped
me
with
a
gasp
in
the
midst
of
what
seemed
an
innocent
question
about
her
stepdaughter
could
it
be
possible
that
her
alarms
might
after
all
be
justified
and
that
the
powerful
association
betrayed
by
would
visit
his
sins
on
his
widow
and
daughter
that
american
accent
of
gemály
he
admitted
having
been
in
new
york
of
course
he
had
made
acquaintances
there
my
thoughts
flashed
back
to
the
meeting
at
the
railway
train
could
the
fellow
have
found
out
in
advance
that
i
was
with
alias
jones
and
her
friends
it
seemed
as
if
such
knowledge
could
have
reached
land
ahead
of
us
only
by
miracle
but
there
was
always
marconi
perhaps
news
of
miss
gilder
had
been
sent
by
wireless
to
alexandria
with
our
humbler
names
starred
as
satellites
of
that
bright
planet
if
this
were
so
bedr
instructed
from
afar
to
watch
richard
widow
might
easily
have
been
clever
enough
to
suborn
a
messenger
waiting
for
one
ernest
borrow
what
are
you
mumbling
about
anthony
wanted
to
know
when
i
forgot
to
answer
have
i
put
some
idea
that
you
do
like
into
your
head
i
was
turning
your
question
over
in
it
i
explained
and
wondering
what
to
answer
of
course
miss
gilder
rather
important
and
i
believe
her
father
obsession
used
to
be
when
she
was
a
child
that
she
be
kidnapped
for
ransom
the
sprite
of
a
woman
you
admire
so
much
knew
the
gilders
in
those
days
she
says
that
the
unfortunate
baby
used
to
be
dragged
about
in
a
kind
of
caged
perambulator
and
that
some
of
her
nurses
were
female
detectives
in
disguise
with
revolvers
under
their
white
aprons
no
wonder
the
girl
revels
in
emancipation
and
travel
i
should
think
now
she
grown
up
to
years
and
five
foot
eight
or
nine
of
height
without
being
kidnapped
there
not
much
danger
so
long
as
she
keeps
in
the
boundaries
of
civilization
still
one
never
knows
in
such
a
queer
world
as
ours
where
newspapers
live
on
happenings
we
laugh
to
scorn
if
they
came
out
of
novel
writers
brains
that
the
only
incentive
you
can
suggest
for
spying
unconnected
with
my
affairs
i
hesitated
for
biddy
secret
was
not
my
secret
and
it
seemed
that
i
had
no
right
to
pass
it
on
even
to
my
best
friend
i
must
ask
permission
before
telling
fenton
that
jones
was
the
widow
of
the
informer
richard
that
she
feared
on
the
part
of
the
enemy
might
confuse
her
girl
travelling
companion
with
esmé
hidden
in
a
convent
school
near
monaco
it
just
credible
that
there
may
be
other
incentives
i
said
but
i
must
confess
rather
believe
that
armenian
spies
were
on
the
track
of
ahmed
antoun
who
can
take
care
of
himself
than
after
poor
miss
gilder
or
any
of
her
party
what
the
name
of
the
laughing
sprite
suddenly
asked
fenton
er
jones
brigit
jones
where
her
husband
in
his
grave
oh
well
his
widow
looks
ready
to
bubble
over
with
the
joy
of
life
so
i
suppose
we
ca
associate
spies
or
anything
shady
with
her
that
too
much
to
hope
for
why
to
for
it
would
make
her
too
interesting
look
here
my
dear
fellow
you
ca
have
them
both
the
dark
eyes
of
antoun
lit
with
a
spark
of
surprise
and
laughter
i
do
want
either
thanks
i
admire
flowers
but
i
never
gather
them
i
leave
them
growing
however
you
might
tell
me
which
one
you
want
for
your
own
buttonhole
really
i
do
know
i
mumbled
taken
aback
all
i
do
know
is
it
not
likely
i
can
get
either
anthony
stared
at
me
with
a
curious
expression
then
abruptly
changed
the
subject
you
heard
of
sir
marcus
lark
he
asked
of
course
said
i
surprised
at
this
question
sandwiched
into
our
affairs
sir
marcus
lark
is
a
man
who
has
had
his
finger
in
many
pies
but
i
did
see
how
he
could
poke
one
into
ours
everybody
knows
sir
lark
given
a
baronetcy
by
the
radicals
some
years
ago
in
return
for
services
to
the
party
starting
and
running
a
newspaper
which
must
have
cost
him
fifty
thousand
pounds
before
it
began
to
pay
he
has
financed
theatres
and
vegetarian
restaurants
he
owns
cocoa
plantations
and
factories
and
a
garden
city
he
has
a
racing
yacht
which
once
beat
the
german
emperor
he
owns
two
hotels
he
has
written
a
book
of
travel
his
name
as
a
director
is
sought
by
financial
companies
he
has
lent
money
to
a
distressed
south
american
government
in
the
making
and
though
the
success
of
his
enterprises
has
sometimes
hung
in
the
balance
for
months
or
years
his
wonderful
luck
seems
invariably
to
triumph
in
the
end
so
much
so
that
lark
luck
has
become
a
heading
for
newspaper
columns
in
the
middle
of
which
his
photograph
is
inset
at
the
mention
of
his
name
the
picture
rose
before
my
eyes
a
big
man
anywhere
between
and
fifty
good
head
large
forehead
curly
hair
kind
eyes
pugnacious
nose
conceited
smile
under
waxed
moustache
heavy
jaw
unconquerable
chin
and
neck
and
shoulders
what
has
sir
marcus
lark
to
do
with
us
he
in
egypt
in
cairo
just
now
and
he
got
our
mountain
good
heavens
i
stared
blankly
at
anthony
seeing
not
his
dark
face
under
the
green
turban
but
that
everlasting
newspaper
block
portrait
down
toppled
our
castle
in
the
air
anthony
and
mine
the
shining
castle
which
had
been
the
lodestone
of
my
journey
to
egypt
the
secret
hope
and
romance
of
our
two
lives
for
all
those
months
since
anthony
first
read
the
ferlini
papers
and
began
negotiations
with
the
egyptian
government
it
all
up
then
i
said
when
i
felt
that
i
could
speak
without
betraying
palsy
of
the
jaw
we
done
i
not
sure
of
that
fenton
answered
if
i
had
been
i
have
broken
the
news
so
brutally
it
on
the
cards
that
we
may
be
able
to
bring
the
thing
off
yet
but
how
if
that
bounder
has
got
the
place
for
himself
he
must
have
found
out
the
truth
about
it
somehow
or
he
would
have
bothered
and
if
he
knows
what
we
know
or
think
we
know
he
certainly
wo
give
up
to
us
what
he
grabbed
for
himself
a
beastly
shame
we
should
have
been
let
in
like
this
after
being
given
to
understand
that
it
would
be
all
right
lark
must
have
had
a
pull
of
some
sort
i
have
learned
what
but
i
will
the
one
hope
is
that
he
has
stumbled
onto
the
secret
what
you
think
he
hit
on
our
pitch
by
a
mere
coincidence
an
accident
no
there
not
a
shadow
of
doubt
that
he
had
a
special
motive
for
wanting
mountain
and
no
other
have
you
formed
an
idea
what
the
motive
is
if
not
the
same
as
ours
i
heard
his
version
from
his
own
lips
it
rather
astounding
and
i
want
you
to
hear
it
from
him
too
you
met
him
yesterday
at
shepheard
before
i
went
in
for
this
business
lark
heard
i
had
wired
for
a
room
at
the
hotel
and
was
lying
in
wait
for
me
on
the
terrace
when
i
got
back
from
the
agency
we
had
a
talk
i
heard
just
before
the
news
about
the
mountain
but
he
explained
now
he
wants
to
see
you
he
got
something
special
to
say
and
i
made
an
appointment
for
you
with
him
at
two
chapter
vi
the
great
sir
marcus
the
appointment
was
at
the
semiramis
hotel
where
sir
marcus
lark
was
staying
i
went
with
my
mind
an
aching
void
and
my
heart
a
cold
boiled
potato
i
can
think
of
nothing
more
disagreeable
for
not
a
word
more
would
fenton
let
drop
as
to
the
great
man
business
with
us
or
the
mountain
of
the
golden
pyramid
i
sent
up
my
card
and
a
few
minutes
later
was
shown
into
a
private
salon
more
appropriate
to
a
beautiful
young
duchess
than
to
a
bumptious
financier
it
was
pale
green
and
white
full
of
lilies
and
fragrance
and
an
immense
french
window
opened
out
upon
a
roofed
loggia
overlooking
the
nile
this
would
have
been
the
ideal
environment
for
our
gilded
rose
and
i
felt
more
venomous
than
before
if
possible
toward
the
rich
bounder
who
posed
against
such
an
unsuitable
background
i
thought
as
the
door
of
the
salon
was
opened
for
me
by
the
smart
arab
servant
that
the
room
was
untenanted
and
that
sir
marcus
lark
meant
to
keep
me
waiting
but
there
he
was
on
the
balcony
gazing
in
rapture
at
the
shining
river
as
if
he
were
capable
of
raptures
he
an
worm
but
there
was
no
mistaking
that
back
those
shoulders
or
the
face
as
the
big
body
turned
he
advanced
through
the
open
window
holding
out
a
hand
as
big
as
a
steak
he
was
exactly
like
his
photograph
except
that
there
was
even
more
of
him
than
i
had
been
led
to
expect
the
pretty
room
was
net
small
but
entering
he
seemed
to
turn
it
into
a
doll
house
parlour
six
foot
two
if
he
an
inch
i
said
to
myself
longing
to
play
david
to
his
goliath
big
rich
common
brute
i
thought
you
snatch
our
mountain
out
of
our
mouths
and
then
you
send
for
us
as
if
we
were
servants
men
whose
boots
you
ought
to
be
blacking
i
was
vindictive
i
stared
him
straight
between
the
eyes
where
a
stone
from
david
sling
would
have
fitted
in
neatly
the
eyes
were
wide
apart
and
kinder
than
in
the
photographs
they
were
even
curiously
innocent
and
boyish
his
grin
of
greeting
made
the
large
waxed
black
moustache
point
joyously
up
he
showed
teeth
white
as
a
child
and
had
dimples
actually
dimples
in
his
big
cheeks
to
say
nothing
of
the
one
in
his
chin
with
which
snapshots
had
familiarized
me
he
looked
like
a
huge
overgrown
schoolboy
with
a
corked
moustache
my
glare
faded
in
the
light
of
his
smile
no
man
with
a
gleam
of
humour
could
have
kept
a
mask
of
grimness
i
found
my
hand
enveloped
in
the
pound
of
steak
and
warmly
shaken
up
and
down
inside
it
lord
ernest
borrow
i
delighted
to
see
you
very
good
of
you
to
come
i
sure
to
david
quoth
goliath
in
a
big
voice
mellow
despite
a
slight
cockney
accent
nice
view
i
treated
myself
to
here
what
i
in
egypt
on
business
but
i
like
to
have
pretty
things
around
me
pleasant
colours
and
flowers
and
a
view
that
a
specialty
of
mine
i
great
on
specializing
and
that
brings
me
to
what
we
have
in
common
a
scheme
of
yours
a
scheme
of
mine
i
wanted
to
detest
the
man
but
somehow
could
to
hate
him
would
be
hating
an
overpowering
force
like
heat
or
electricity
with
an
politeness
he
made
me
sit
down
picking
out
my
chair
the
most
comfortable
in
the
room
then
taking
the
next
best
for
himself
he
fitted
into
it
as
tightly
as
a
ripe
plum
into
its
skin
and
talked
with
one
leg
crossed
over
the
other
and
swinging
the
points
of
his
brown
fingers
joined
i
was
glad
they
were
brown
i
afraid
you
sore
with
me
he
began
having
ordered
coffee
and
liqueurs
and
forced
upon
his
guest
a
cigar
as
big
as
a
sausage
got
what
you
and
your
friend
wanted
and
i
going
to
be
frank
with
you
as
i
been
with
him
and
admit
that
i
got
it
because
you
did
want
it
simply
and
solely
for
that
reason
and
nothing
else
he
told
you
this
he
left
the
telling
to
you
i
said
wondering
why
i
was
more
furious
than
curious
but
it
was
the
other
way
round
good
egg
he
promised
he
would
and
he
looks
the
sort
of
chap
to
keep
his
promise
well
i
see
you
want
me
to
get
down
to
business
and
i
will
i
going
to
lay
all
my
cards
on
the
table
i
came
here
to
egypt
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
to
see
a
scheme
through
and
i
landed
on
the
scene
in
time
to
find
that
i
was
likely
to
fail
i
have
told
any
one
else
that
but
your
friend
fenton
for
i
never
have
made
a
business
failure
yet
and
i
do
mean
to
now
if
i
can
help
it
the
scheme
had
to
be
saved
in
a
hurry
if
it
could
be
saved
at
all
and
when
i
set
my
wits
to
work
i
saw
that
i
must
get
hold
of
some
such
young
men
as
you
and
captain
fenton
to
help
me
i
do
know
how
the
thought
of
you
two
popped
into
my
head
but
i
suppose
it
was
seeing
a
lot
of
stuff
about
fenton
in
the
papers
his
balkan
adventure
and
the
announcement
that
he
been
recalled
to
his
regiment
there
were
paragraphs
about
him
as
a
linguist
and
an
egyptologist
and
anecdotes
of
him
as
a
smart
soldier
you
know
the
sort
of
thing
and
the
stories
about
his
parentage
caught
my
fancy
a
bit
they
romantic
i
got
enough
romance
in
me
to
see
that
side
of
life
and
to
know
how
it
goes
down
with
the
women
this
scheme
of
mine
depends
on
women
most
schemes
do
at
the
same
time
the
egyptian
papers
were
printing
paragraphs
about
lord
ernest
borrow
i
do
know
whether
you
aware
of
that
or
not
no
would
you
like
to
see
i
had
my
secretary
cut
out
and
the
fenton
stuff
too
the
minute
this
idea
began
to
wiggle
in
my
mind
like
a
tadpole
in
water
i
kept
everything
do
trouble
about
the
paragraphs
thanks
i
said
all
right
it
will
save
our
time
not
to
but
your
wish
to
go
in
with
your
friend
for
the
rights
of
excavating
in
the
sudan
was
mentioned
and
the
delay
on
account
of
alleged
interference
with
pitch
by
jove
i
wonder
how
the
reporters
got
onto
that
i
could
help
exclaiming
it
their
livelihood
to
get
onto
everything
then
i
said
to
myself
my
chance
my
only
one
i
want
those
two
young
men
they
the
right
combination
nation
for
me
to
give
real
distinction
to
my
undertaking
i
have
money
but
they
ai
the
sort
you
can
buy
with
money
there
must
be
an
incentive
if
i
get
what
they
want
perhaps
i
can
get
so
i
went
into
the
job
tooth
and
nail
neither
you
nor
fenton
was
on
the
spot
i
was
very
much
on
it
nothing
was
definitely
fixed
up
between
the
government
and
fenton
for
the
right
to
excavate
at
the
mountain
of
the
golden
pyramid
as
they
call
the
little
old
molehill
and
i
scored
now
if
you
two
will
do
what
i
want
you
can
have
your
mountain
and
whatever
you
find
you
can
keep
worth
more
to
me
than
any
beads
and
statues
under
the
sand
of
egypt
i
think
i
made
some
impression
on
your
friend
he
may
be
inclined
to
go
in
with
me
if
you
will
he
explained
that
in
any
case
he
ca
use
his
own
name
on
account
of
his
position
in
the
army
and
so
on
that
a
disappointment
to
me
but
i
put
up
with
it
for
the
sake
of
his
accomplishments
and
his
looks
your
name
alone
will
carry
the
necessary
weight
as
a
leader
you
very
flattering
said
i
but
i
in
the
dark
i
going
to
put
you
wise
as
americans
say
my
scheme
was
and
is
to
be
a
rival
of
cook
on
the
nile
not
only
that
but
all
over
the
near
east
you
heard
of
course
about
my
buying
the
marquis
of
redruth
yacht
on
his
bankruptcy
the
second
biggest
and
the
most
yacht
in
the
world
and
turning
her
into
a
pleasure
cruiser
for
the
mediterranean
if
i
heard
i
afraid
my
memory
treacherous
said
i
glad
to
show
how
unimportant
to
me
were
the
schemes
of
financiers
but
interested
in
the
yacht
name
which
carried
my
thoughts
away
to
meröe
great
scout
and
i
spent
two
thousand
in
advertising
i
taken
whole
pages
of
london
and
continental
papers
i
never
read
advertisements
if
i
can
help
it
except
of
new
patents
in
razors
they
a
fad
of
mine
thank
goodness
you
got
fads
then
we
something
in
common
i
make
money
out
of
my
fads
i
call
inspirations
i
thought
the
business
was
one
of
my
inspirations
and
that
i
have
some
fun
out
of
it
i
advertised
her
to
start
on
her
first
pleasure
cruise
from
marseilles
to
gib
algiers
tangier
tunis
greece
alexandria
and
jaffa
be
a
smack
in
the
eye
for
the
big
liners
i
said
to
myself
skim
the
top
layer
of
clotted
cream
off
their
passenger
lists
i
was
going
to
do
the
thing
straight
through
bid
for
the
swell
set
exclusiveness
my
motto
of
course
i
did
expect
to
hit
the
dukes
and
dollar
kings
first
shot
but
i
thought
if
everything
went
right
the
passengers
would
tell
their
friends
at
home
how
much
better
we
did
them
on
board
than
any
one
else
had
ever
done
and
we
get
a
ad
that
nothing
could
stop
all
would
have
worked
out
first
rate
if
i
had
made
one
mistake
i
engaged
a
retired
army
colonel
for
a
conductor
on
board
my
yacht
i
got
the
man
cheap
but
i
was
a
fool
to
economize
on
him
i
ought
to
have
launched
out
on
a
belted
earl
folks
especially
americans
do
like
retired
colonels
the
woods
are
full
of
over
there
crawling
with
most
americans
are
colonels
and
not
retired
besides
this
chap
of
mine
no
good
anyhow
fancies
himself
as
a
politician
and
is
a
snob
has
no
tact
rubs
up
the
passengers
the
wrong
way
and
outrages
their
feelings
we
got
a
lot
of
people
from
the
north
of
england
rich
and
a
bit
crude
like
me
will
you
believe
it
colonel
corkran
began
his
job
by
sneering
audibly
at
to
some
beastly
friend
of
his
come
to
see
him
off
at
marseilles
instead
of
making
his
lectures
a
kind
of
travellogue
as
he
was
hired
to
do
he
turns
into
political
tirades
and
calls
the
liberals
scoundrels
half
of
our
folks
being
rads
not
only
that
if
the
girls
and
boys
talk
while
the
band
playin
any
of
his
favourite
airs
he
hisses
out
through
a
hole
in
his
mouth
where
one
tooth
missin
that
tooth
gone
has
got
on
the
girls
nerves
worse
than
anything
else
it
would
seem
except
his
being
down
on
suffragettes
and
the
crisis
was
reached
when
he
insulted
miss
hassett
bean
the
richest
and
most
important
woman
in
the
bunch
when
she
expressed
her
political
opinions
said
to
her
dear
lady
why
do
you
bother
to
have
opinions
they
give
you
a
lot
of
trouble
to
collect
and
nobody
else
will
trouble
to
listen
why
not
collect
insects
or
stamps
instead
of
course
she
did
think
germany
had
already
invaded
england
with
a
large
army
of
soldiers
disguised
as
hotel
waiters
which
was
calculated
to
rile
an
old
officer
but
no
excuse
for
a
man
who
paid
to
please
and
now
the
wondering
why
he
not
popular
with
the
passengers
i
laughed
but
sir
walter
had
worked
himself
into
a
state
past
smiling
point
it
no
laughing
matter
he
said
this
snob
corkran
killing
my
scheme
there
a
plot
on
foot
for
the
party
to
walk
off
the
yacht
at
alexandria
and
demand
half
their
passage
money
some
old
grampus
on
board
has
started
the
story
that
the
has
been
down
three
times
a
lie
of
course
i
soothed
him
a
dastardly
lie
she
been
down
only
twice
the
first
time
was
a
collision
the
second
a
coincidence
but
i
thought
she
was
the
most
yacht
in
the
world
so
she
is
as
the
that
was
the
marquis
name
for
her
gave
it
after
a
trip
to
egypt
he
bought
her
second
hand
and
rechristened
her
while
she
was
being
redecorated
he
spared
no
expense
which
he
could
well
afford
seeing
that
he
never
paid
a
penny
i
got
her
at
cost
price
as
you
may
say
but
these
plotters
are
going
to
claim
that
they
were
inveigled
on
board
under
false
pretences
by
my
advertising
the
as
the
newest
thing
in
yachts
i
had
a
letter
and
several
cypher
telegrams
from
the
assistant
conductor
a
useful
chap
telling
me
the
whole
story
of
the
plot
which
he
nosed
out
and
i
faced
with
humiliating
failure
unless
i
can
save
the
situation
by
a
grand
coup
at
the
eleventh
hour
now
you
can
guess
why
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
i
bought
up
your
rights
to
dig
in
the
sudan
ca
you
i
confess
i
ca
i
said
why
i
want
you
to
take
colonel
corkran
place
on
the
as
conductor
and
i
want
you
and
your
friend
fenton
to
go
up
nile
in
charge
of
the
splendid
steam
dahabeah
i
bought
to
supplement
the
mediterranean
trip
there
you
have
my
motives
in
a
nutshell
i
burst
out
laughing
a
cracked
nutshell
i
remarked
sir
rosy
face
turned
royal
purple
what
you
wo
undertake
it
i
could
i
assured
him
for
one
thing
i
be
a
fish
out
of
water
my
dear
sir
perhaps
you
do
know
that
my
nickname
since
the
age
of
five
has
been
i
proud
of
it
i
take
pains
to
live
up
to
it
i
bet
you
do
i
bet
it
opens
doors
and
lays
down
velvet
carpets
for
you
why
a
duffer
with
a
title
is
exactly
what
i
want
duffers
are
the
rage
nowadays
you
and
your
friend
will
make
a
brilliant
pair
a
fine
contrast
especially
with
your
friend
present
get
up
if
you
both
been
born
for
me
you
could
suit
me
better
i
laughed
again
you
said
you
ought
to
have
launched
out
on
belted
earls
we
humble
there
no
earls
handy
and
if
there
were
any
they
would
be
what
you
two
are
in
looks
and
talents
to
say
nothing
of
your
brother
being
a
marquis
i
offering
you
both
the
softest
kind
of
job
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
be
agreeable
young
gentlemen
with
a
knowledge
of
society
and
history
that
means
you
can
be
yourselves
you
get
a
fine
trip
on
high
salaries
if
you
do
scorn
to
accept
my
money
and
as
a
reward
for
a
good
holiday
you
receive
the
right
to
explore
your
golden
mountain
i
suppose
you
must
think
it
a
golden
mountain
or
you
would
be
such
nuts
on
it
you
better
consult
your
friend
before
you
refuse
my
offer
anyhow
have
you
heard
that
fenton
left
cairo
i
took
the
precaution
to
ask
that
does
look
as
if
he
were
entertaining
the
idea
of
going
up
the
nile
on
your
steam
dahabeah
i
have
heard
that
he
left
but
i
happen
to
know
it
is
so
i
saw
him
standing
in
front
of
hotel
this
morning
waiting
for
you
i
got
on
to
what
was
in
that
green
turban
before
the
pretty
girl
in
white
miss
gilder
i
found
out
since
called
him
on
to
the
terrace
do
look
as
if
you
wanted
to
eat
me
lord
ernest
i
won
my
way
up
from
the
bottom
rung
of
the
ladder
by
keeping
my
eyes
open
and
by
putting
two
and
two
together
i
specialize
on
that
i
do
suppose
there
another
man
in
cairo
except
me
and
you
would
have
recognized
fenton
so
you
need
worry
i
twigged
that
he
dressed
up
for
serious
business
not
for
fun
because
i
read
about
some
smart
coups
he
brought
off
by
going
among
the
natives
like
one
of
themselves
i
not
a
sneak
and
i
sha
revenge
myself
by
giving
him
away
even
if
you
two
do
show
me
the
frozen
face
captain
fenton
encouraged
me
to
think
he
might
consider
my
proposition
if
you
would
though
he
refused
to
influence
your
decision
one
way
or
the
other
naturally
i
conclude
that
he
could
be
on
my
nile
boat
if
he
wanted
to
even
if
not
in
his
own
capacity
as
an
officer
i
take
him
in
his
green
turban
he
makes
the
best
looking
egyptian
i
ever
saw
and
he
go
down
with
the
ladies
like
hot
cakes
sir
marcus
i
smiled
you
one
of
the
most
amusing
as
well
as
the
sharpest
men
if
you
allow
me
to
say
so
that
i
ever
met
whatever
happens
i
shall
not
forget
this
conversation
i
do
want
you
to
forget
it
he
grinned
beginning
to
hope
think
it
over
we
the
chance
of
a
lifetime
for
each
other
and
remember
the
mountain
of
the
golden
pyramid
i
rose
and
he
got
up
heavily
when
will
you
let
me
know
he
asked
i
was
tempted
to
reply
that
he
must
have
taken
fenton
seeming
encouragement
too
seriously
that
mountain
or
no
mountain
it
was
practically
impossible
for
us
to
accept
his
amazing
proposition
but
suddenly
i
seemed
to
hear
antoun
effendi
telling
miss
gilder
that
she
must
wait
for
his
decision
until
evening
he
had
said
afterward
also
that
it
depended
on
me
it
was
evident
that
he
had
a
scheme
of
his
own
worked
by
wheels
within
wheels
he
had
consoled
me
after
the
first
blow
by
saying
that
all
was
not
lost
and
i
had
four
months
leave
from
duty
a
lot
could
be
done
in
four
months
i
will
let
you
know
before
night
i
said
to
sir
marcus
lark
chapter
vii
the
revelations
of
a
retired
colonel
fenton
orders
were
when
the
cairo
business
should
be
finished
to
go
slowly
up
the
nile
in
native
dress
and
get
at
the
truth
of
certain
rumours
which
had
disturbed
officialdom
at
cairo
at
denderah
luxor
and
two
or
three
other
places
there
had
been
incidents
small
but
troublesome
english
sightseers
had
complained
of
being
hustled
and
even
insulted
by
the
inhabitants
of
several
river
towns
and
it
was
important
to
find
out
whether
the
egyptians
or
the
foreigners
had
been
more
to
blame
whether
there
were
real
symptoms
of
sedition
as
reported
or
whether
the
young
men
of
the
suspected
places
had
merely
resented
with
roughness
some
discourtesy
of
tactless
tourists
fenton
had
seized
upon
the
idea
that
as
egyptian
lecturer
and
conductor
a
sort
of
on
board
lark
nile
boat
he
might
find
a
plausible
pretext
for
his
secret
errand
why
do
you
travel
would
be
the
question
he
must
expect
from
suspicious
leaders
of
any
plot
that
might
be
hatching
if
he
journeyed
from
one
nile
village
to
another
without
the
excuse
of
business
as
a
glorified
conductor
of
a
for
a
party
of
tourists
his
excuse
would
be
readymade
for
him
but
he
had
been
far
from
sure
that
i
would
fall
in
with
sir
marcus
plan
despite
the
bribe
he
had
wanted
me
to
hear
the
whole
story
the
whole
project
from
sir
marcus
own
lips
and
in
his
uncertainty
of
the
result
he
had
thought
of
miss
gilder
as
an
attractive
victim
there
she
was
as
he
had
said
presented
to
him
by
providence
if
i
should
pour
scorn
upon
the
lark
suggestion
he
might
find
it
worth
while
to
guide
the
gilded
girl
and
her
friends
on
their
nile
pilgrimage
he
left
the
question
for
me
and
i
decided
to
kill
as
many
birds
as
possible
with
one
stone
the
name
of
the
yacht
was
in
itself
an
incentive
queen
of
meröe
our
meröe
she
seemed
to
call
and
to
promise
good
luck
we
would
accept
lark
terms
and
enter
his
service
in
return
for
a
written
agreement
to
hand
over
his
digging
rights
to
us
whether
or
no
we
turned
out
to
be
satisfactory
as
guides
we
could
but
do
our
best
and
at
all
events
we
should
earn
the
reward
which
we
had
looked
upon
as
ours
already
anthony
would
play
his
double
part
serving
the
interests
of
government
and
those
of
sir
marcus
lark
as
for
monny
gilder
why
should
she
and
her
party
become
passengers
the
only
reason
against
this
inspiration
as
sir
marcus
would
have
called
it
lay
in
the
fact
that
monny
wished
to
engage
a
private
dahabeah
when
she
wished
for
a
thing
it
appeared
that
only
a
miracle
or
a
cataclysm
could
induce
her
to
give
it
up
for
something
else
suggested
by
an
outsider
but
when
i
mentioned
this
peculiarity
to
fenton
he
was
fired
to
punish
the
girl
by
forcing
her
compliance
with
our
will
she
had
treated
him
like
a
servant
she
looked
upon
a
man
supposedly
of
egyptian
blood
even
though
of
princely
birth
somewhat
as
she
looked
upon
an
american
nigger
true
anthony
fenton
had
in
his
veins
but
very
few
such
drops
on
his
father
side
he
was
all
english
and
his
mother
had
been
more
than
two
thirds
greek
and
italian
nevertheless
this
spoilt
girl
had
struck
a
blow
at
the
pride
which
went
ever
walking
about
the
world
with
a
chip
lightly
poised
on
its
shoulder
anthony
had
no
desire
to
poach
on
my
preserves
at
the
same
time
he
yearned
to
show
miss
gilder
that
he
could
be
her
master
not
her
servant
once
anthony
and
i
had
made
up
our
minds
everything
else
arranged
itself
with
lightning
speed
sir
marcus
rejoicing
in
his
conquest
of
us
broke
to
me
the
news
that
i
must
go
by
the
first
ship
to
the
piraeus
to
meet
the
and
head
off
the
recalcitrant
band
of
passengers
he
flattered
me
by
thinking
that
if
i
took
the
place
of
colonel
corkran
as
conductor
they
would
abandon
their
plot
to
desert
the
yacht
at
alexandria
it
was
according
to
lark
secret
information
only
the
smart
and
smart
set
who
had
combined
to
spring
this
mine
upon
the
management
the
rest
grumbled
no
more
than
it
was
normal
for
all
to
grumble
and
as
roughly
speaking
the
contented
travellers
were
all
going
on
to
palestine
after
a
week
wild
sightseeing
in
cairo
the
colonel
might
be
allowed
to
continue
his
voyage
without
the
interruption
of
a
row
i
should
have
had
enough
common
sense
at
the
start
growled
sir
marcus
with
crude
candour
to
engage
a
lord
for
the
smart
set
and
a
parson
for
the
ernest
inquirers
there
a
world
of
difference
catering
for
a
set
and
a
flock
the
art
is
to
know
it
and
how
to
do
it
now
i
secured
you
i
all
right
with
the
and
thanks
be
i
a
young
reformed
missionary
on
board
to
shepherd
the
flock
now
the
reverend
watts
will
come
in
handy
herding
his
sheep
through
palestine
while
the
colonel
swaggers
and
fancies
he
bossing
the
show
it
the
egypt
lot
i
worry
about
girls
out
for
dukes
and
dukes
out
for
dollars
not
that
there
a
darned
duke
on
board
but
there
are
some
who
think
they
the
dukes
and
it
our
business
to
humour
you
just
duff
all
you
want
to
lord
ernest
they
swallow
anything
you
do
like
honey
do
bother
about
a
line
of
conduct
only
be
genial
murmur
soft
nothings
to
the
women
flirt
but
do
have
favourites
do
be
too
political
with
the
men
work
in
plenty
of
anecdotes
about
your
swell
relations
i
replied
that
i
could
confidently
promise
geniality
except
if
seasick
but
sir
marcus
implored
me
at
all
costs
not
to
be
seasick
that
was
the
one
thing
i
must
not
be
my
whole
time
between
the
piraeus
and
alexandria
on
board
the
must
be
spent
ingratiating
myself
with
the
sulky
passengers
and
obliterating
from
their
memories
the
crimes
of
colonel
corkran
in
sir
marcus
opinion
my
future
charges
had
taken
passage
on
the
and
would
go
up
the
nile
not
to
see
sights
but
to
be
seen
doing
the
right
things
according
to
him
not
two
out
of
twenty
cared
tuppence
for
egypt
but
wished
to
talk
about
it
in
sparkling
style
at
home
my
friend
captain
fenton
and
i
must
make
it
sparkle
sir
marcus
had
resigned
himself
to
the
fact
that
one
of
his
trump
cards
anthony
could
not
be
produced
until
the
arrival
in
cairo
of
the
troupe
and
that
even
then
the
name
of
fenton
must
not
be
used
as
an
attraction
lark
felt
confident
that
i
was
a
good
enough
card
to
make
his
hand
worth
playing
and
in
spite
of
the
half
contemptuous
amusement
with
which
i
regarded
the
whole
scheme
i
could
help
being
on
my
mettle
i
found
myself
wanting
to
succeed
wanting
to
please
the
big
common
man
whom
a
few
hours
ago
i
had
been
cursing
i
had
to
start
for
greece
the
night
after
our
decision
meanwhile
i
was
anxious
to
explain
the
unexplainable
to
brigit
and
monny
and
secure
the
party
for
sir
marcus
lark
alleged
dahabeah
which
turned
out
to
be
one
of
cook
old
boats
bought
and
newly
decorated
both
my
tasks
would
be
difficult
i
had
to
hide
the
secret
reason
for
selling
myself
to
the
financier
and
at
the
same
time
keep
the
respect
of
the
ladies
as
for
inducing
miss
gilder
to
give
up
her
dream
of
a
private
dahabeah
i
foresaw
that
it
would
be
like
persuading
the
youngest
lioness
in
the
cairo
zoo
to
surrender
her
cherished
wooden
ball
but
i
began
by
giving
monny
a
present
a
fine
old
of
rare
red
tortoise
shell
inlaid
with
mother
of
pearl
which
i
found
at
an
antiquary
in
the
silklined
box
reposed
a
green
turban
and
that
green
turban
told
its
own
story
miss
gilder
flushed
with
pleasure
at
sight
of
it
i
won
my
bet
she
exclaimed
yes
said
i
to
my
astonishment
the
man
consents
he
a
great
prize
knows
cairo
and
upper
egypt
like
a
book
but
you
have
to
surrender
him
when
you
go
on
the
nile
in
her
haste
to
know
why
monny
forgot
to
ask
how
i
had
obtained
the
green
turban
and
for
this
i
was
glad
because
it
was
only
the
second
best
headgear
of
my
smart
friend
the
hadji
in
explaining
that
the
distinguished
egyptian
had
been
engaged
by
sir
marcus
lark
i
slipped
in
a
word
about
my
own
part
in
the
trip
describing
it
as
an
ideal
for
a
budding
diplomat
on
sick
leave
i
praised
the
boat
and
spoke
of
the
fun
on
board
i
regretted
miss
gilder
preference
for
a
private
dahabeah
so
obvious
so
millionairy
still
i
added
every
one
to
his
taste
and
anyhow
no
doubt
all
the
best
cabins
on
the
were
taken
that
was
the
entering
wedge
the
mention
of
an
obstacle
to
overcome
miss
gilder
looked
thoughtful
though
she
kept
silence
and
next
day
when
making
my
adieux
before
starting
for
alexandria
she
flung
out
a
careless
question
when
would
the
leave
cairo
how
many
passengers
would
she
carry
would
there
be
a
rush
at
the
temples
or
would
there
be
plenty
of
time
for
proper
sightseeing
and
was
i
sure
that
all
the
nicest
cabins
were
engaged
no
i
was
not
sure
i
could
inquire
i
tried
not
to
look
triumphant
but
i
must
have
darted
out
a
ray
because
monny
withdrew
into
her
shell
she
had
inquired
out
of
curiosity
she
explained
i
had
told
such
stories
about
the
that
she
would
like
to
see
her
perhaps
antoun
effendi
could
get
permission
for
a
visit
to
the
boat
in
this
state
i
had
to
leave
affairs
and
start
for
the
piraeus
where
i
must
await
the
return
of
the
tourists
from
athens
i
had
two
days
at
sea
in
which
to
work
up
an
agony
of
apprehension
and
i
could
have
thanked
heaven
when
arriving
on
board
the
big
white
yacht
i
found
that
i
was
ahead
of
the
passengers
i
was
expected
however
and
a
deck
cabin
was
ready
for
my
occupation
i
hoped
that
i
had
not
turned
out
my
rival
from
the
room
but
dared
not
question
the
steward
he
seemed
to
know
all
about
me
nevertheless
and
said
that
my
name
had
been
posted
up
as
conductor
of
the
nile
party
if
i
may
take
the
liberty
of
mentioning
it
my
lord
he
added
it
has
made
a
very
good
impression
we
were
to
steam
for
alexandria
the
moment
the
passengers
arrived
in
the
special
train
having
had
three
days
of
sightseeing
in
athens
and
i
had
just
got
my
possessions
stowed
away
when
a
wave
of
chattering
voices
broke
over
the
ship
my
heart
gave
a
jump
as
a
soldier
must
when
called
to
fight
on
an
empty
stomach
at
dawn
on
a
winter
morning
what
ought
i
to
do
how
was
i
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
my
future
charges
must
it
be
en
masse
or
could
it
be
done
singly
i
had
neglected
to
ask
sir
marcus
what
would
be
expected
of
me
and
i
was
in
a
worse
funk
than
a
new
boy
on
his
first
day
at
school
soon
it
would
be
dinner
time
i
wished
that
i
were
ill
but
i
remembered
that
the
one
thing
i
must
not
do
was
to
be
seasick
already
the
ship
was
beginning
to
move
out
of
the
greek
harbour
or
i
should
have
been
tempted
to
get
a
telegram
calling
me
home
even
the
mountain
of
the
golden
pyramid
seemed
not
too
great
a
sacrifice
to
make
but
it
was
too
late
to
make
it
and
some
one
was
knocking
at
my
door
i
opened
it
with
such
courage
as
i
had
and
the
instant
i
set
eyes
on
the
man
i
knew
that
he
was
colonel
corkran
he
was
born
to
be
a
retired
colonel
what
came
before
the
retiring
could
have
been
but
a
prelude
a
stout
figure
of
middle
height
red
face
veined
on
cheeks
and
nose
pale
blue
eyes
which
looked
as
if
they
had
faded
in
the
wash
purple
moustache
and
eyebrows
gray
hair
a
double
chin
clamouring
for
extra
collar
space
and
a
expression
this
was
the
rival
whose
place
i
had
virtually
though
not
officially
usurped
i
was
prepared
to
hear
him
hiss
viper
between
his
teeth
as
characters
in
melodramatic
serials
do
to
perfection
their
front
teeth
having
doubtless
been
designed
for
such
purposes
but
his
look
seemed
to
denote
pity
rather
than
hatred
so
might
a
regard
a
condemned
man
in
coming
to
announce
the
hour
of
execution
lord
ernest
borrow
said
he
in
a
slightly
hoarse
voice
i
colonel
corkran
delighted
to
meet
you
i
met
your
brother
lord
killeena
daresay
he
would
remember
me
i
do
think
i
can
begin
better
than
by
thanking
you
for
coming
to
take
over
my
job
oh
i
have
done
that
i
hastened
to
protest
as
he
sat
fatly
down
in
a
chair
i
pushed
forward
as
i
understand
i
to
take
a
few
people
off
your
hands
and
the
hands
of
your
assistant
kruger
so
that
you
can
go
to
palestine
instead
of
leaving
that
important
excursion
entirely
to
the
chaplain
mr
watts
colonel
corkran
laughed
thank
you
for
trying
to
save
my
feelings
said
he
but
i
assure
you
they
not
hurt
i
sincerely
delighted
to
see
you
for
my
own
sake
for
yours
well
that
another
pair
of
shoes
my
dear
fellow
i
wonder
if
you
the
smallest
idea
what
in
for
in
for
i
echoed
yes
i
saying
this
as
a
friend
do
think
i
jealous
lord
no
i
look
on
you
as
a
deliverer
and
do
think
i
want
to
frighten
you
it
is
that
but
i
feel
it
my
duty
to
prepare
you
i
might
have
got
on
better
if
there
been
some
one
to
do
the
same
by
me
there
was
kruger
my
assistant
is
a
spy
at
best
he
a
mere
accountant
not
supposed
to
look
after
the
passengers
socially
i
gather
that
he
was
some
secretary
of
lark
beware
of
him
he
writes
to
lark
from
every
port
as
for
the
passengers
the
saintly
lot
are
bad
enough
yet
it
only
the
food
and
the
cabins
and
the
attendance
grumble
about
i
shunted
off
the
worldly
lot
onto
them
in
future
but
at
their
worst
they
be
a
and
lark
has
the
decency
not
to
reduce
my
screw
it
the
worldly
lot
that
going
to
make
you
curse
the
day
you
were
born
he
wanted
me
to
speak
or
groan
but
i
maintained
a
stricken
silence
to
which
i
gave
some
illusion
of
dignity
after
a
disappointed
pause
he
went
on
you
better
know
something
about
these
people
beasts
every
one
of
young
or
old
some
beastly
common
beasts
but
all
beastly
rich
except
those
that
are
beastly
poor
and
on
the
make
to
marry
their
daughters
or
cadge
for
smart
friends
lark
was
bidding
for
swells
and
got
snobs
thinks
his
silly
title
will
carry
weight
in
society
as
it
does
in
the
city
pie
we
called
i
hear
i
call
us
a
kettle
of
fish
the
girls
are
the
worst
of
the
caboodle
though
some
of
are
bad
looking
you
wo
believe
the
trouble
i
had
with
the
creatures
till
you
begin
to
get
the
same
yourself
what
kind
of
trouble
i
inquired
gingerly
every
kind
a
woman
can
make
apart
from
food
troubles
they
think
they
not
being
entertained
enough
on
board
think
i
ought
to
get
up
more
dances
tango
teas
i
suppose
do
like
the
way
i
organize
games
are
mad
because
they
ca
have
music
at
meals
which
they
because
the
band
all
stewards
blame
me
because
the
men
do
make
love
to
them
or
because
they
do
and
at
the
hotels
where
we
go
on
shore
it
hades
naturally
the
people
staying
in
the
hotels
resent
us
they
look
on
us
as
a
menagerie
a
rabble
so
we
are
at
least
they
are
i
do
count
myself
in
with
them
what
can
i
do
i
not
omnipotent
perhaps
you
are
anyhow
they
prepared
to
believe
it
for
you
a
new
broom
a
broom
with
a
fine
handle
i
only
a
poor
colonel
with
a
few
medals
given
by
my
country
for
services
that
were
appreciated
you
brother
to
a
marquis
you
paint
a
lurid
picture
i
said
when
he
stopped
for
breath
i
could
paint
it
lurider
than
it
is
but
you
have
to
find
out
for
yourself
it
wo
be
so
bad
while
you
a
novelty
do
say
i
have
warned
you
and
oh
by
the
way
i
announced
that
you
to
be
presented
to
the
passengers
at
dinner
on
coming
in
before
the
soup
is
served
as
a
sort
of
i
suppose
i
murmured
weakly
colonel
corkran
stared
without
a
smile
as
the
titled
conductor
of
the
egypt
tour
he
explained
to
my
dull
intelligence
with
a
slight
sneer
so
will
you
please
be
in
the
dining
saloon
just
before
the
bugle
blows
the
beasts
in
i
have
to
introduce
you
in
a
short
speech
it
all
i
can
do
except
say
god
help
you
but
i
do
see
how
he
can
i
suppose
your
friend
sir
marcus
told
you
that
you
would
be
expected
to
deliver
a
lecture
on
egypt
at
the
dinner
table
after
you
finished
your
dinner
of
course
i
hope
the
cracking
and
crunching
of
nuts
does
disturb
you
much
i
confess
i
found
it
getting
on
my
nerves
i
was
aghast
my
mind
jumped
to
the
wild
thought
of
eating
soap
in
order
to
froth
at
the
mouth
and
simulate
a
fit
it
seemed
my
only
way
of
escape
and
after
that
the
deluge
but
my
rival
was
so
revelling
in
the
mental
havoc
he
had
wrought
that
i
rallied
replying
that
as
sir
marcus
had
not
broken
the
news
to
me
i
did
see
how
it
would
be
possible
to
deliver
a
lecture
are
you
up
on
egypt
the
colonel
asked
pityingly
neither
am
i
though
i
sweated
over
baedeker
with
my
head
in
wet
towels
when
i
wanted
to
be
at
bridge
but
i
thought
that
was
the
excuse
for
engaging
you
that
and
your
title
of
course
which
is
going
to
make
you
popular
as
fast
as
i
fag
up
the
names
of
those
beastly
egyptian
gods
or
kings
and
queens
they
run
out
of
my
brains
like
water
out
of
a
sieve
or
if
i
do
contrive
to
remember
any
by
chance
together
with
their
dates
which
is
almost
more
than
can
be
expected
of
the
human
intellect
why
i
find
that
i
pronounce
wrong
or
they
spelled
another
way
in
the
next
book
but
i
suppose
as
you
know
egypt
its
d
d
history
comes
natural
as
breathing
how
i
wished
it
did
and
how
different
was
this
new
programme
from
the
one
outlined
by
sir
marcus
just
to
be
genial
and
flirt
with
the
girls
my
recollections
of
egypt
are
from
some
time
ago
i
admitted
to
give
a
lecture
at
half
an
hour
in
justice
to
yourself
i
afraid
you
have
to
the
colonel
persisted
it
been
announced
that
you
will
give
the
lecture
and
the
egypt
lot
are
looking
forward
to
it
as
the
animals
in
a
zoo
look
forward
to
their
food
if
they
defrauded
they
think
you
a
slacker
and
that
you
presuming
on
your
title
i
should
like
that
my
anguish
racked
out
of
me
i
fancied
you
would
but
what
to
be
done
am
i
to
announce
when
i
introduce
you
that
your
knowledge
of
egypt
is
equal
to
the
strain
i
took
an
instant
for
reflection
i
knew
that
he
was
hoping
i
might
throw
myself
on
his
mercy
or
else
that
i
would
speak
and
fail
but
i
determined
to
do
neither
on
second
thoughts
i
may
be
able
to
give
some
kind
of
a
i
replied
colonel
corkran
face
fell
that
all
right
then
he
exclaimed
getting
to
his
feet
well
i
must
be
off
will
you
have
a
cocktail
no
thanks
said
i
i
think
i
can
get
on
without
it
he
was
at
the
door
kind
of
hash
of
gods
and
goddesses
with
a
peppering
of
kings
and
queens
and
mixed
sauce
of
history
and
legend
is
what
needed
were
his
farewell
words
then
he
shut
the
door
and
i
tore
my
watch
from
the
pocket
of
my
waistcoat
i
had
minutes
in
which
to
prepare
the
said
hash
with
its
seasoning
and
sauce
and
the
bugle
was
inviting
my
judges
to
dress
for
the
inquisition
chapter
viii
foxy
duffing
i
show
you
your
place
corkran
volunteered
lying
in
wait
for
me
inside
the
saloon
door
with
a
cocktail
in
his
hand
sorry
you
would
have
one
you
need
it
but
no
time
to
change
your
mind
i
put
you
at
the
head
of
the
table
that
would
be
the
captain
if
he
ate
with
us
which
he
does
happy
man
place
of
honour
was
mine
is
yours
but
i
ca
go
on
with
the
quotation
unless
i
turn
it
into
slave
to
thousands
sixty
odd
can
be
as
formidable
as
thousands
are
there
sixty
odd
i
asked
yes
very
the
egypt
lot
will
be
about
but
the
whole
gang
yours
for
the
present
i
give
them
to
you
with
the
seat
of
honour
please
do
put
me
in
your
place
i
protested
i
prefer
my
poor
boy
it
is
a
question
of
what
you
prefer
as
you
learn
if
you
stick
this
out
of
course
if
you
funk
it
but
that
a
joke
this
table
the
only
one
where
you
can
be
heard
do
you
see
i
did
see
and
accepted
the
situation
because
the
dinner
bugle
began
to
sound
and
i
could
not
be
scampering
round
the
saloon
like
a
frightened
rabbit
as
the
set
and
the
flock
began
dropping
in
to
dinner
as
it
happened
they
did
not
drop
they
poured
into
the
room
in
a
steady
stream
which
phenomenon
whispered
corkran
was
caused
by
curiosity
for
a
first
sight
of
me
my
heart
counted
each
new
arrival
with
a
bump
if
corkran
had
not
represented
lark
party
as
being
a
menagerie
for
which
i
had
inadvertently
engaged
as
tamer
i
should
have
thought
they
looked
a
harmless
crowd
but
then
of
course
i
was
not
obliged
to
tame
anybody
on
the
which
makes
a
difference
in
one
point
of
view
miss
gilder
needed
taming
no
doubt
but
i
had
tackled
the
task
my
thoughts
flew
to
cairo
as
i
stood
struggling
to
look
pleasant
and
i
wished
myself
back
where
anthony
fenton
was
now
in
the
taming
business
i
envied
him
for
there
was
only
one
monny
whereas
in
this
terrible
bright
dining
saloon
the
air
was
pink
and
white
with
girls
dozens
of
girls
with
eyes
fixed
on
me
glittering
eyes
which
appeared
like
the
headlights
of
motor
cars
i
did
suppose
there
could
be
so
many
eyes
in
the
world
as
these
people
of
all
ages
and
every
possible
sex
seemed
to
own
sixty
odd
they
were
according
to
corkran
but
they
looked
like
six
hundred
a
human
miracle
of
loaves
and
fishes
yes
the
creatures
might
have
appeared
harmless
enough
had
there
been
no
retired
colonel
but
there
was
a
retired
colonel
and
so
deftly
had
he
undermined
my
courage
that
almost
any
shock
might
cause
it
to
explode
in
a
blue
flame
of
funk
his
speech
of
introduction
was
now
to
come
and
if
i
survived
that
i
might
hope
to
live
through
my
own
fireworks
they
put
on
their
best
bibs
and
tuckers
corkran
mumbled
in
a
stage
whisper
as
the
eight
dwellers
at
our
table
began
to
sort
themselves
for
places
then
in
portentous
silence
he
paused
till
everybody
everywhere
was
seated
waiting
still
until
satisfied
that
eyes
and
ears
were
focussed
upon
us
he
rapped
on
the
table
with
the
handle
of
a
knife
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
roared
i
have
the
pleasure
of
introducing
to
you
sir
marcus
lark
great
surprise
entitled
lord
ernest
borrow
younger
brother
of
the
marquis
of
killeena
a
peer
as
sir
marcus
has
reminded
us
of
the
oldest
lineage
in
ireland
let
me
reassure
you
all
by
saying
that
lord
ernest
last
name
is
as
unsuited
to
his
nature
as
the
first
is
true
to
it
if
you
pardon
the
pun
it
is
sir
marcus
who
for
your
benefit
and
he
has
borrowed
trouble
but
a
blessing
in
disguise
i
am
now
left
free
as
suits
my
superior
age
and
experience
to
devote
my
attention
to
the
serious
minded
ones
among
you
who
are
to
proceed
with
the
reverend
watts
and
myself
to
palestine
this
young
and
gallant
neophyte
will
it
over
the
fleshpots
of
egypt
and
those
about
to
seek
them
i
hope
you
help
him
as
loyally
as
you
have
helped
and
later
we
drink
to
his
health
and
success
in
any
beverage
we
happen
to
have
signed
for
to
have
killed
corkran
might
have
been
butchery
no
jury
could
have
brought
in
a
verdict
of
murder
or
even
manslaughter
had
i
stabbed
him
with
the
knife
he
used
to
pound
upon
the
table
i
smiled
the
smile
of
a
skull
in
a
doctor
and
in
a
sickly
voice
bleated
my
pleasure
in
meeting
these
new
acquaintances
i
hoped
we
might
be
er
friends
as
well
as
shipmates
then
like
a
mass
of
jelly
out
of
its
mould
i
plopped
onto
my
chair
the
colonel
had
sneaked
off
to
his
own
table
and
i
was
left
to
recover
myself
as
best
i
might
among
eight
of
his
enemies
they
proved
in
whispers
to
be
the
most
active
of
these
and
tacitly
offered
me
allegiance
which
i
accepted
in
the
same
manner
there
was
a
sir
john
biddell
who
informed
me
in
the
first
five
minutes
that
he
had
been
lord
mayor
of
london
he
promised
to
show
me
a
speech
he
had
made
in
the
presence
of
king
edward
which
in
the
form
of
a
newspaper
cutting
he
never
travelled
without
this
however
was
his
first
trip
farther
than
paris
and
he
had
brought
with
him
not
only
the
speech
but
his
wife
and
twin
daughters
the
distinguished
family
occupied
one
side
of
my
table
the
other
was
given
up
to
a
general
harlow
his
wife
both
with
high
profiles
and
opinions
of
themselves
a
youngish
newspaper
proprietor
from
manchester
evidently
rich
and
a
catch
and
a
maiden
lady
doubtless
of
importance
equal
to
her
proportions
as
she
was
allowed
to
bring
to
the
table
a
melancholy
marmoset
these
people
did
their
best
to
raise
my
spirits
the
girls
who
copied
royalties
in
their
looked
alike
dressed
alike
talked
and
laughed
alike
and
entertained
me
with
chat
about
high
society
in
london
they
had
red
cheeks
black
eyes
white
teeth
and
an
almost
indecent
familiarity
with
the
private
lives
of
the
aristocracy
the
misses
biddell
and
fat
miss
the
lady
of
the
marmoset
hinted
that
the
cream
of
the
yacht
social
life
had
risen
to
our
table
and
told
me
not
only
what
to
lecture
about
but
how
to
treat
the
rival
cliques
my
brain
felt
more
and
more
like
a
i
answered
at
random
and
longed
for
the
meal
to
end
until
i
remembered
my
lecture
then
i
wished
that
dinner
might
go
on
indefinitely
like
the
tea
party
of
the
mad
hatter
all
too
soon
the
glory
of
a
french
menu
flickered
down
to
a
dying
spark
of
nuts
and
raisins
and
hardly
had
i
cracked
my
first
almond
was
it
an
ill
omen
that
there
should
be
a
worm
in
it
when
a
steward
handed
me
a
twisted
note
from
the
executioner
the
rule
for
conductor
dinner
speech
is
rise
with
the
raisins
hope
you
wo
find
your
lecture
too
hard
a
nut
to
crack
yours
sympathetically
corkran
bang
on
the
table
to
make
them
stop
gabbling
or
shall
i
do
it
for
you
if
you
have
by
the
time
i
count
ten
i
will
he
did
i
trust
it
was
my
courage
that
failed
but
having
a
raisin
in
my
mouth
i
could
not
on
the
instant
respond
to
the
lash
and
as
corkran
would
have
said
it
takes
more
than
one
swallow
to
make
a
speech
ruthlessly
he
rapped
seizing
what
i
wished
might
be
his
dying
chance
to
indulge
a
mania
for
puns
and
thumping
wood
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
bawled
from
his
comparatively
obscure
corner
lord
ernest
borrow
will
render
your
last
moments
the
most
enjoyable
of
the
meal
by
washing
down
your
nuts
and
raisins
with
the
wine
of
his
eloquence
take
your
desserts
now
we
conscientious
conductors
hope
for
ours
in
heaven
how
ardently
i
desired
that
these
might
indeed
be
the
last
moments
not
only
of
my
audience
but
of
colonel
corkran
if
the
next
second
had
brought
a
tidal
wave
or
a
collision
i
should
have
blessed
providence
but
i
got
to
my
feet
and
nothing
happened
i
seemed
to
be
in
a
dream
of
having
shot
up
to
a
gigantic
height
and
having
put
on
the
wrong
clothes
or
none
my
hands
weighed
two
pounds
each
and
ought
to
have
been
at
the
butcher
my
mouth
was
the
size
of
a
negro
minstrel
and
so
full
of
large
bones
which
once
had
been
teeth
that
i
could
not
utter
a
syllable
i
clacked
my
jaws
and
emitted
a
hacking
cough
which
fortunately
so
much
resembled
that
of
a
professional
lecturer
that
i
kept
my
senses
not
only
did
i
keep
them
but
they
seemed
suddenly
to
become
my
servants
the
thought
of
a
certain
fable
jumped
into
my
head
and
i
began
thereupon
to
speak
although
i
had
forgotten
everything
i
had
ever
read
of
egyptian
history
it
happens
said
i
in
a
phonographic
voice
that
i
was
born
in
egypt
i
played
with
clay
gods
and
goddesses
instead
of
tin
soldiers
i
preferred
stories
of
egypt
past
and
present
to
tales
of
adventure
i
confess
to
you
what
i
fear
i
did
confess
to
sir
marcus
lark
the
trouble
is
i
stuffed
too
full
of
facts
about
egypt
i
want
you
to
help
me
get
them
out
and
not
duplicate
yours
no
doubt
all
of
you
in
travelling
to
the
east
have
packed
your
brains
with
knowledge
as
well
as
your
boxes
with
guide
books
why
should
i
bore
you
by
telling
you
things
that
you
were
born
knowing
a
plan
has
occurred
to
me
by
which
your
knowledge
can
be
turned
into
account
as
i
said
i
beg
your
help
and
permission
to
drink
a
cup
of
coffee
would
be
first
aid
people
laughed
whether
at
me
or
with
me
i
was
not
sure
yet
i
felt
that
i
had
tickled
their
curiosity
coffee
was
going
round
corkran
was
unctuously
sipping
his
and
had
not
expected
me
to
receive
mine
till
after
the
battle
but
i
got
it
in
spite
of
him
and
mapped
out
a
programme
as
i
drank
then
i
ceased
to
tremble
before
the
confused
assemblage
or
gods
goddesses
and
sacred
vultures
that
danced
or
flapped
in
my
brain
i
no
longer
felt
inclined
to
commit
suicide
because
i
could
remember
nothing
about
egypt
except
that
the
delta
was
shaped
like
a
lily
with
the
fayum
for
a
bud
and
the
nile
for
its
stem
that
alexander
the
macedonian
defeated
darius
the
persian
three
hundred
and
something
that
ancient
egyptians
loved
beer
but
were
forbidden
to
eat
beans
my
proposal
is
i
went
on
that
before
i
unload
any
of
my
knowledge
upon
you
i
gleam
some
idea
of
what
you
know
already
thus
i
can
spare
you
repetitions
any
one
who
has
anything
particularly
interesting
to
say
about
egypt
let
him
or
her
hold
up
a
hand
now
was
the
crucial
moment
if
no
hand
went
up
i
was
lost
but
hardly
were
the
words
out
of
my
mouth
when
there
was
a
waving
as
if
in
a
wheatfield
aux
dames
i
called
upon
miss
to
begin
she
rustled
silkily
up
bowing
to
me
then
directing
an
acetylene
glare
upon
colonel
corkran
end
of
the
room
she
was
i
foresaw
about
to
kill
two
birds
with
one
stone
to
say
nothing
of
the
marmoset
who
fell
off
her
arm
into
general
harlow
coffee
and
created
a
brief
diversion
as
soon
however
as
the
monkey
was
rescued
and
before
general
harlow
shirt
front
was
dried
the
lady
began
to
speak
we
all
thank
lord
ernest
she
said
looking
from
the
colonel
to
the
reverend
wyman
watts
and
back
again
for
sparing
us
one
of
those
commonplace
inflictions
from
which
we
nightly
suffered
on
board
this
yacht
if
we
did
know
already
such
facts
as
christianity
being
introduced
to
egypt
by
mark
in
nero
time
and
moses
and
plato
both
studying
philosophy
at
heliopolis
and
things
like
that
we
would
be
spending
our
money
with
sir
marcus
lark
to
see
egypt
never
before
have
we
been
encouraged
to
air
our
views
those
of
us
with
political
opinions
have
been
snubbed
and
we
who
are
interested
in
woman
suffrage
have
been
assured
that
we
find
nothing
to
please
us
in
the
land
of
veiled
women
at
last
i
am
given
a
chance
to
state
without
being
interrupted
that
egypt
was
once
the
most
enlightened
country
in
her
treatment
of
women
long
before
the
time
of
the
greeks
and
even
before
the
shepherd
kings
watts
has
told
us
so
much
about
using
his
old
testament
as
if
it
were
a
baedeker
the
women
of
ancient
egypt
had
rights
according
to
their
class
queens
and
princesses
were
considered
equal
with
their
husbands
women
were
great
musicians
playing
on
many
instruments
especially
the
sistrum
sacred
to
the
goddess
hathor
and
were
all
the
best
gods
goddesses
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
women
used
to
drive
their
own
chariots
as
we
do
our
motors
and
hold
salons
like
the
french
ladies
there
was
rhodopis
for
instance
who
married
the
brother
of
sappho
i
wonder
if
colonel
corkran
could
have
told
you
that
the
story
of
cinderella
comes
from
an
anecdote
of
rhodopis
i
hardly
think
that
he
been
able
to
spare
enough
time
from
bridge
to
study
strabo
who
was
the
baedeker
of
egypt
for
tourists
six
hundred
years
before
christ
an
eagle
saw
rhodopis
bathing
and
stealing
one
of
her
sandals
flew
with
it
to
memphis
where
he
dropped
it
into
the
king
lap
it
was
so
small
and
dainty
that
king
hophra
scoured
egypt
for
the
owner
and
when
he
found
her
at
last
according
to
strabo
made
her
his
queen
if
strabo
was
right
she
lived
long
before
sappho
day
interpolated
the
colonel
voice
of
course
strabo
was
right
there
were
two
of
rhodopis
everybody
knows
that
the
third
pyramid
was
built
for
the
tomb
of
the
first
one
for
king
mycineris
believe
why
should
a
woman
have
a
pyramid
to
herself
the
sphinx
is
a
woman
as
i
will
insist
to
my
dying
day
if
it
were
my
last
word
i
hope
lord
ernest
wo
ram
down
our
throats
any
nonsense
about
that
noble
and
graceful
tribute
to
the
mystery
of
womanhood
being
a
stupid
king
harmachis
or
horemkhu
i
would
believe
it
if
i
found
a
hundred
nasty
stone
beards
lying
buried
in
the
sand
under
her
chin
instead
of
one
which
could
easily
have
been
put
there
to
deceive
people
probably
king
harmachis
had
the
sphinx
altered
to
look
like
him
no
wonder
she
shuddered
at
such
profanation
and
shed
her
false
beard
there
you
have
my
theory
and
as
for
egypt
being
now
the
land
of
veiled
women
where
suffragettes
find
no
sympathy
i
heard
that
the
prophet
order
for
veiling
has
been
purposely
misconstrued
by
tyrannical
men
with
their
usual
jealousy
even
mohammed
himself
was
jealous
with
this
miss
sat
down
amid
fitful
applause
and
at
my
earnest
request
miss
enid
biddell
the
prettier
twin
stood
bravely
up
she
wished
before
the
subject
was
changed
to
tell
some
little
things
she
had
read
about
the
girls
of
ancient
egypt
how
like
they
were
to
girls
of
in
all
their
ways
especially
in
in
things
concerning
love
it
was
they
who
first
questioned
the
petals
of
flowers
for
their
lovers
loyalty
how
much
they
thought
about
their
clothes
too
getting
their
best
things
from
foreign
countries
as
women
did
now
from
paris
it
was
so
funny
to
read
how
the
girls
of
old
egypt
had
consulted
palmists
and
fortune
tellers
and
astrologers
just
as
girls
did
in
bond
street
now
and
that
what
and
and
were
to
us
images
of
gods
were
to
the
girls
of
egypt
who
lived
before
the
days
of
moses
they
had
scarab
rings
with
magic
inscriptions
and
sacred
apes
for
the
symbol
of
intelligence
and
lucky
eyes
of
horus
wounded
by
the
wicked
god
set
and
cured
by
the
love
of
isis
on
their
bracelets
and
necklaces
they
hung
charms
and
their
were
covered
with
images
of
favourite
gods
and
goddesses
hathor
the
goddess
of
love
and
joy
was
supposed
to
give
her
choicest
gifts
to
girls
who
wore
her
special
colour
that
in
the
temple
of
edfu
which
robert
hichens
calls
the
colour
of
love
and
to
those
who
had
her
pet
stones
emeralds
or
turquoises
nowadays
in
egypt
the
jewels
of
the
women
were
only
lent
to
them
by
their
men
and
could
be
taken
away
as
a
punishment
or
be
pawned
or
sold
in
case
of
need
but
in
old
days
egyptian
women
had
all
their
most
beautiful
possessions
buried
with
them
when
her
sister
had
finished
i
urged
the
other
twin
to
speak
and
timidly
miss
elaine
repeated
to
us
what
a
friend
of
hers
a
clergyman
here
a
blush
had
told
her
that
the
red
sea
was
not
red
but
a
brighter
blue
than
any
sea
in
the
world
and
called
red
only
because
it
washed
the
red
lands
her
friend
had
written
down
for
her
in
verse
a
sweet
legend
about
the
nile
rising
every
spring
from
a
single
tear
shed
by
isis
a
more
powerful
goddess
than
hathor
because
she
was
the
goddess
of
goodness
as
well
as
love
and
the
nile
used
to
be
named
sihor
by
the
egyptians
and
the
year
separated
into
three
seasons
flood
time
seed
time
and
harvest
miss
biddell
friend
was
writing
a
book
about
egypt
and
was
going
to
divide
it
in
three
parts
like
that
it
was
to
be
dedicated
to
bless
the
dear
creatures
how
they
kept
the
ball
rolling
to
please
themselves
and
indirectly
to
sort
out
my
stock
of
ideas
harry
snell
the
newspaper
man
was
not
hard
to
persuade
to
his
feet
he
was
studying
the
resemblance
between
arabic
and
english
words
he
had
found
out
among
other
things
that
tallyho
was
tallyhoon
brought
home
by
the
crusaders
he
even
had
a
theory
that
some
of
our
words
came
from
the
early
egyptian
amen
for
instance
he
believed
to
be
derived
from
amon
the
name
of
the
great
god
father
of
all
the
other
gods
of
egypt
which
was
cried
aloud
he
understood
in
the
temples
during
religious
services
the
parson
jumped
eagerly
up
to
dispute
this
theory
and
happily
forgetful
of
me
seized
the
opportunity
to
spring
upon
us
a
few
facts
from
his
own
store
when
however
watts
discourse
got
him
as
far
as
joseph
well
in
the
citadel
general
harlow
could
bear
no
more
but
sprang
up
to
inform
us
that
the
joseph
of
the
well
in
the
citadel
was
quite
another
joseph
some
yusef
of
the
arab
conquerors
the
general
knew
all
about
that
because
his
son
was
stationed
in
the
citadel
and
he
proceeded
to
meander
on
historically
over
a
period
between
the
first
arab
conqueror
amru
to
assuring
us
that
old
cairo
was
the
city
of
the
arabian
nights
he
would
to
my
joy
have
gone
on
indefinitely
from
saladin
to
napoleon
if
sir
john
biddell
as
the
only
baronet
on
board
had
not
cut
the
only
general
short
he
is
a
square
man
whose
portrait
could
be
properly
done
only
by
a
cubist
too
much
history
my
friend
he
shouted
getting
up
with
the
manner
of
one
accustomed
to
making
speeches
what
most
of
us
are
coming
to
egypt
for
is
egyptian
history
is
too
troublesome
anyhow
for
a
normal
man
to
grasp
give
me
mummies
there
something
them
why
even
if
you
get
a
king
or
queen
fixed
in
your
head
somebody
who
paid
to
make
you
know
things
you
do
know
an
for
corkran
comes
along
and
swears
they
did
exist
now
there
mena
i
pinned
him
like
a
stuck
butterfly
i
could
remember
that
he
was
the
first
known
king
and
founded
memphis
and
lived
six
thousand
years
before
christ
all
because
we
going
to
stay
at
mena
house
which
is
named
after
him
i
do
know
why
i
remembered
him
that
way
but
i
did
just
as
i
could
recall
the
queen
with
a
name
like
a
sneeze
by
thinking
of
her
as
queen
now
colonel
corkran
informs
us
that
we
must
pronounce
her
in
a
different
way
and
what
the
consequence
to
me
i
ceased
to
try
and
keep
track
of
her
king
mena
too
is
lost
to
me
forever
through
the
of
our
late
conductor
who
says
there
never
was
a
mena
only
several
kings
they
mixed
into
one
i
seem
to
be
the
one
who
most
mixed
up
to
whet
my
appetite
for
egypt
now
i
have
to
have
something
tasty
where
the
good
of
stuffing
my
mind
with
a
string
of
names
which
i
could
mention
to
any
one
at
home
because
i
ca
pronounce
them
the
word
dynasty
he
pronounced
it
makes
me
sick
luckily
i
feel
that
nobody
else
will
know
any
more
than
i
do
i
coming
to
egypt
for
a
because
i
do
have
to
learn
its
history
but
some
lecturers
wo
let
me
have
a
minute
peace
a
king
named
sneferu
could
expect
to
appeal
to
a
man
like
me
even
if
he
did
build
the
oldest
pyramid
and
even
if
you
could
show
me
his
mummy
which
you
ca
but
i
draw
the
line
at
kings
without
mummies
i
do
want
to
know
them
now
my
wife
is
against
mummies
on
show
she
heard
that
the
malignance
of
mummies
especially
in
museums
is
incredible
and
she
thinks
it
a
judgment
that
some
of
the
most
distinguished
ones
are
going
bad
she
says
it
spite
i
say
its
management
but
i
not
ready
to
sit
down
yet
my
wife
means
to
start
a
society
for
the
prevention
of
cruelty
to
mummies
with
the
object
of
sending
them
back
to
their
tombs
where
they
can
rest
in
that
state
of
death
it
pleased
their
gods
to
call
them
to
their
object
was
eternal
privacy
and
they
spent
more
on
their
tombs
than
their
houses
because
they
expected
to
be
dead
a
long
tune
and
wanted
all
the
comforts
of
home
but
i
judge
mummies
by
myself
it
would
have
taken
me
these
thousands
of
years
to
realize
how
narrow
and
my
notions
had
been
i
should
see
that
i
owed
some
duty
to
the
world
and
as
so
much
posterity
had
rolled
by
since
my
day
i
feel
that
lying
in
a
museum
at
some
large
place
like
cairo
was
after
all
the
only
way
to
keep
my
name
before
the
public
now
that
brings
me
to
my
tip
for
lord
ernest
he
asks
what
there
is
we
do
know
and
want
to
know
i
answer
for
us
all
being
used
to
feel
the
pulse
of
crowds
we
want
to
know
what
the
deuce
ancient
egyptians
really
believed
about
death
and
religion
had
they
any
sense
or
were
they
just
plain
fools
on
the
tide
of
applause
which
congratulated
the
boat
only
baronet
i
rose
i
felt
that
i
was
on
the
crest
of
the
wave
for
the
ancient
religion
of
egypt
appeals
to
me
and
as
i
now
had
reason
to
hope
that
others
were
comfortably
ignorant
of
my
subject
i
could
spread
myself
as
much
as
i
pleased
the
ancient
egyptians
were
far
from
being
fools
i
answered
sir
john
with
the
air
of
being
in
their
confidence
we
who
are
tempted
to
think
so
do
take
the
trouble
to
try
the
key
of
their
faith
in
its
door
i
might
say
that
its
door
was
the
door
of
the
tomb
if
we
go
through
that
door
into
the
kingdom
of
osiris
amenti
which
the
greeks
renamed
hades
the
mysteries
which
appear
tangled
sort
themselves
graciously
out
the
story
of
isis
the
great
enchantress
and
her
search
for
the
body
of
her
husband
osiris
murdered
by
set
his
wicked
and
jealous
brother
spirit
of
evil
is
perhaps
the
most
lovable
legend
of
the
world
but
in
hearing
that
horus
the
son
of
isis
was
really
the
same
god
as
osiris
modern
ideas
begin
to
get
mixed
and
confuse
themselves
over
isis
goddess
of
love
and
goodness
hathor
mistress
of
love
and
joy
pasht
and
sekhet
goddesses
of
love
and
passion
there
horus
the
youth
too
and
horus
the
child
represented
in
statues
with
his
thumb
in
his
mouth
how
is
one
to
make
sense
of
them
all
but
once
you
have
the
key
it
is
easy
and
even
beautiful
the
esoteric
or
secret
religion
known
to
the
high
priests
and
the
instructed
ones
was
different
from
the
and
adoration
of
deities
which
gave
the
common
people
such
interest
in
daily
life
they
would
have
been
lost
without
their
monsters
and
the
priests
would
have
been
lost
without
the
temples
necessary
for
the
worship
of
such
a
menagerie
for
egypt
was
a
country
in
old
days
the
explanation
of
the
many
gods
and
goddesses
was
this
each
was
a
different
phase
of
the
one
god
rã
the
sun
by
whom
and
through
whom
only
the
world
could
exist
animals
and
birds
were
chosen
to
express
the
different
phases
because
animals
were
considered
to
be
nearer
nature
therefore
nearer
god
than
human
beings
besides
to
give
a
god
the
head
of
a
man
would
not
set
him
apart
from
humanity
as
it
would
to
make
him
appear
with
the
body
of
a
man
and
the
head
of
some
bird
or
beast
horus
finished
off
with
the
head
of
a
hawk
that
sacred
bird
who
could
look
the
sun
in
the
face
became
to
the
uneducated
eye
a
supernatural
being
which
he
would
not
have
been
with
the
face
of
a
smiling
youth
the
child
horus
or
harpocrates
was
not
respected
as
was
horus
of
the
hawk
head
he
was
merely
petted
and
loved
even
set
god
of
evil
was
all
bad
he
was
the
spirit
of
storm
and
strife
in
nature
and
had
to
be
propitiated
by
the
ignorant
typhon
or
typhoon
and
he
were
one
red
was
his
colour
and
people
were
his
children
there
were
a
hundred
phases
of
the
one
god
each
made
incarnate
given
his
own
mission
and
worshipped
in
a
different
place
it
an
ill
wind
of
set
that
blows
nobody
good
and
animals
had
a
gorgeous
time
in
those
days
very
few
were
sacred
for
some
reason
or
other
it
was
death
and
destruction
to
kill
a
cat
and
i
do
think
that
cats
have
forgotten
to
this
day
the
importance
they
had
in
egypt
it
made
them
the
most
supercilious
of
animals
if
were
angry
he
could
become
menthu
the
war
god
if
he
were
inclined
to
be
gentle
he
could
shrink
to
the
dimensions
of
horus
of
the
rising
sun
if
he
were
weary
he
could
rest
as
the
old
god
tum
of
the
setting
sun
probably
gods
and
goddesses
never
enjoyed
themselves
so
much
as
in
ancient
egypt
and
though
it
does
seem
a
drawback
from
our
artistic
point
of
view
for
hathor
to
have
the
head
or
ears
of
a
cow
for
wise
thoth
to
have
the
long
beak
of
an
ibis
and
so
on
it
was
for
them
only
an
amusing
kind
of
masquerade
or
party
on
the
walls
of
the
temples
and
tombs
at
home
they
could
be
what
they
liked
think
how
interesting
for
the
egyptians
to
have
all
these
queer
gods
and
what
variety
it
gave
to
their
lives
perhaps
the
priests
really
meant
well
in
keeping
the
secret
of
the
one
god
for
themselves
and
the
kings
as
the
people
were
fitted
to
bear
its
solemnity
fancy
how
amusing
it
was
for
the
children
to
be
told
on
nights
about
khonsu
god
of
the
moon
always
young
wearing
the
curled
lock
of
youth
on
his
brow
who
staked
five
nights
of
his
light
playing
draughts
with
thoth
father
of
magic
but
he
had
a
more
serious
phase
for
when
he
was
not
a
gambler
he
was
an
expeller
of
demons
a
most
popular
accomplishment
indeed
almost
every
god
had
several
thriving
businesses
conducted
under
different
aliases
khnum
the
creator
dweller
at
the
cataracts
is
my
favourite
and
is
still
busy
as
he
looks
after
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
river
hekt
goddess
of
birth
was
a
pal
of
his
in
spite
of
her
appalling
ugliness
and
she
used
to
kneel
by
his
potter
wheel
while
he
fashioned
the
clay
she
would
hold
the
sign
of
life
so
that
spirit
might
enter
into
the
formed
body
when
khnum
got
it
to
the
right
state
for
very
important
babies
royal
ones
or
geniuses
she
held
a
sign
of
life
in
each
hand
which
made
them
extraordinarily
vital
when
you
arrive
in
egypt
the
first
thing
be
asked
to
buy
will
be
the
sign
or
key
of
life
in
the
shape
of
paper
knives
or
brooches
or
what
not
and
it
will
be
pointed
out
to
you
in
tombs
till
you
tired
and
sick
of
it
you
can
buy
hekt
too
and
funny
old
bes
of
children
quite
the
golliwog
of
her
day
and
all
the
other
gods
and
goddesses
will
be
offered
to
you
to
say
nothing
of
the
kings
who
were
entitled
to
worship
themselves
as
gods
if
they
wanted
to
it
easy
you
see
to
make
fun
of
the
ancient
religion
and
other
nations
did
make
fun
of
it
but
to
be
serious
the
priests
were
nearer
right
than
it
would
seem
for
they
believed
that
god
was
all
that
there
was
nothing
in
this
or
any
universe
which
was
not
part
of
god
that
note
was
my
highest
and
i
stopped
on
it
besides
i
could
think
of
nothing
more
to
say
i
ventured
to
sit
down
and
because
the
people
were
glad
to
hear
the
last
of
me
or
because
i
had
helped
them
finish
their
almonds
and
raisins
they
applauded
secretly
i
shook
hands
with
myself
as
the
monkey
must
have
done
when
with
the
catspaw
he
had
pulled
the
hot
chestnuts
out
of
the
fire
i
had
carefully
selected
my
chestnuts
and
waited
till
they
were
cool
also
i
had
disappointed
colonel
corkran
chapter
ix
what
happened
when
my
back
was
turned
three
letters
for
me
brought
out
by
the
pilot
one
i
had
expected
from
anthony
but
my
heart
gave
a
bound
as
i
recognized
handwriting
not
seen
for
years
and
instinct
told
me
that
the
third
was
from
monny
gilder
my
one
thought
for
the
last
two
days
steaming
back
from
the
piraeus
to
alexandria
had
been
that
i
was
drawing
nearer
to
cairo
and
to
those
whose
doings
in
my
absence
pulled
at
my
curiosity
and
keyed
my
interest
to
breaking
point
but
if
you
think
that
i
tore
open
those
envelopes
and
greedily
absorbed
their
contents
the
moment
they
were
put
into
my
hands
you
have
never
been
a
conductor
or
even
an
observant
passenger
on
a
pleasure
yacht
when
the
letters
arrived
i
was
engaged
in
persuading
they
of
the
habit
who
ought
never
to
leave
their
peaceful
english
homes
that
it
would
give
them
more
real
pleasure
to
be
first
in
the
shore
boats
than
last
at
the
table
then
to
get
them
into
the
boats
then
to
hypnotize
lady
biddell
and
harlow
into
the
belief
that
they
would
not
could
not
be
seasick
on
the
dancing
waves
which
bobbed
us
up
and
down
no
time
to
think
of
the
letters
much
less
to
feel
the
strangeness
of
fate
which
brought
me
back
in
such
queer
circumstances
to
the
port
i
had
entered
on
the
eight
days
ago
as
soon
as
we
get
on
shore
i
soothed
my
gnawing
impatience
steal
a
minute
somehow
but
each
moment
was
so
conspicuously
labelled
that
i
could
not
be
a
thief
of
time
my
time
which
was
my
time
bought
and
paid
for
by
sir
marcus
lark
this
was
not
the
first
occasion
on
which
i
heard
the
clanking
of
my
chains
for
although
i
flattered
myself
that
i
was
a
popular
success
popularity
had
penalties
on
the
night
of
the
lecture
i
had
used
the
passengers
since
then
they
had
used
me
old
ladies
appealed
to
me
on
questions
of
etiquette
health
or
religion
and
retailed
my
answers
not
always
correctly
girls
asked
my
advice
about
keeping
up
flirtations
and
men
wanted
my
help
in
getting
out
of
them
i
was
expected
to
spout
pages
of
strabo
or
pliny
at
an
instant
notice
i
must
know
why
plato
went
to
egypt
or
how
long
he
stayed
and
be
umpire
between
american
and
british
i
must
be
able
to
explain
the
true
meaning
and
age
of
the
sphinx
invent
new
deck
games
and
show
those
who
had
learned
how
to
dance
the
tango
but
with
those
three
letters
burning
over
my
heart
the
duties
of
conductor
became
infuriating
it
was
an
awful
day
for
what
was
pompey
pillar
to
me
while
i
remained
ignorant
of
my
friends
adventures
as
i
discoursed
more
or
less
learnedly
about
diocletian
and
ptolemy
plot
to
drown
pompey
in
the
nile
something
inside
was
asking
has
anthony
fallen
in
love
with
monny
gilder
what
scrapes
has
that
blessed
girl
got
into
has
anything
happened
to
worry
biddy
even
that
nameless
but
incomparable
tomb
on
the
hill
of
kom
could
not
distract
my
thoughts
from
the
sealed
envelopes
and
three
very
modern
handwritings
came
obstinately
between
my
eyes
and
the
matchless
paintings
as
fresh
in
their
underground
as
if
finished
yesterday
instead
of
in
days
when
it
was
dowdy
to
be
pagan
fashionable
to
be
christian
corkran
as
a
soldier
had
to
guide
a
band
to
aboukir
and
chat
about
nelson
point
out
the
medieval
fort
of
kait
bey
and
dash
with
hired
motors
to
adjemi
where
napoleon
landed
kruger
took
a
few
studious
pilgrims
to
that
unspoiled
oriental
nile
town
where
the
rosetta
stone
gave
the
secrets
of
ancient
egypt
to
the
world
it
was
mine
to
pilot
the
frivolous
lot
to
escort
them
in
carriages
round
the
city
when
they
had
absorbed
its
two
chief
sights
to
give
them
a
glimpse
of
the
museum
and
to
let
them
see
the
beauty
and
fashion
of
alexandria
driving
out
to
san
stefano
in
the
late
afternoon
still
i
had
no
chance
to
read
my
letters
but
thought
i
at
the
hotel
now
at
last
it
has
come
not
at
all
people
trunks
were
missing
or
in
the
wrong
rooms
it
was
i
who
had
to
sooth
alarms
and
calm
rising
storms
it
was
i
who
must
assure
harlow
that
her
room
was
really
preferable
to
that
of
lady
biddell
and
lady
biddell
that
she
and
not
miss
had
the
best
in
the
hotel
still
i
had
ten
minutes
to
dress
for
dinner
like
gladstone
i
could
do
it
in
five
and
have
five
left
for
my
letters
but
hardly
had
i
slipped
a
paper
knife
under
the
flap
of
monny
envelope
i
should
have
felt
a
vandal
to
tear
it
when
one
of
the
hotel
managers
knocked
at
my
door
a
gentleman
was
being
very
angry
in
the
he
insisted
on
seeing
me
he
said
he
had
been
lord
mayor
of
london
and
ought
to
have
a
all
these
were
previously
engaged
what
was
to
be
done
would
i
kindly
come
at
once
i
persuaded
sir
john
that
were
the
least
desirable
owing
to
draughts
and
returning
to
my
room
had
four
minutes
to
dress
or
risk
further
rows
after
dinner
miss
burst
into
tears
because
she
was
alone
in
the
world
owing
to
the
marmoset
death
from
seasickness
and
now
that
she
was
growing
old
nobody
cared
to
talk
to
her
i
argued
that
people
were
shy
because
she
was
more
important
than
they
and
had
a
reputation
for
satire
it
took
half
an
hour
for
the
lady
nose
to
go
from
red
to
pink
i
think
she
had
papier
poudré
in
her
handkerchief
and
then
i
was
obliged
to
walk
on
the
beach
with
miss
enid
biddell
to
keep
watts
from
proposing
as
snell
relieved
me
from
sentry
duty
i
was
called
by
kruger
to
discuss
certain
details
of
next
morning
start
for
cairo
and
at
midnight
when
i
crawled
to
my
room
a
shattered
wreck
the
letters
were
still
unread
i
incapable
of
caring
now
i
groaned
what
has
happened
to
any
of
them
if
an
earthquake
has
swallowed
up
our
mountain
and
married
monny
and
brigit
been
abducted
or
vice
versa
and
miss
guest
has
gone
off
with
the
jewels
it
will
leave
me
calm
that
was
the
spirit
in
which
i
tossed
up
a
coin
to
see
which
letter
to
read
first
heads
monny
tails
anthony
but
the
penny
rolled
away
far
under
the
bed
where
go
and
so
i
opened
biddy
she
began
my
dear
good
duffer
for
any
sake
hurry
back
make
an
excuse
to
leave
your
pilgrims
the
minute
you
get
this
and
take
the
first
train
to
cairo
surely
the
late
conductor
can
be
your
understudy
and
trot
the
people
round
alexandria
for
a
day
we
need
you
more
than
they
do
i
picture
you
reading
this
early
in
the
morning
with
alexandria
still
in
the
distance
for
you
said
you
arrange
to
have
letters
come
out
to
the
yacht
by
the
pilot
i
shall
expect
a
telegram
saying
by
what
train
you
arrive
here
in
the
afternoon
you
understand
when
i
told
you
everything
why
it
for
you
to
hurry
we
have
done
and
seen
so
many
things
it
seems
years
instead
of
days
since
you
left
us
in
care
of
that
handsome
hadji
of
yours
i
wonder
if
really
you
did
suspect
that
i
guessed
who
he
was
or
you
suspect
and
did
care
i
caught
the
look
in
your
eyes
when
you
first
saw
him
standing
under
the
terrace
at
shepheard
and
then
when
the
name
antoun
effendi
came
up
in
the
conversation
i
put
two
and
two
together
east
guesses
also
i
do
know
if
she
did
from
the
first
but
she
does
now
it
is
a
question
of
guessing
with
either
of
us
really
it
a
certainty
not
that
she
said
anything
to
me
or
i
to
her
that
is
the
malady
of
us
all
since
you
went
we
are
boiling
with
secret
thoughts
and
keeping
them
to
ourselves
which
is
bad
for
us
and
for
each
other
in
the
long
run
i
have
told
monny
that
the
egyptian
prince
as
rachel
guest
has
nicknamed
him
is
your
friend
captain
anthony
fenton
playing
some
deep
game
partly
connected
with
us
partly
connected
with
a
secret
of
his
and
yours
the
secret
you
said
was
a
dusty
one
in
which
women
would
not
be
interested
i
have
told
her
because
i
do
want
her
to
know
she
is
always
talking
and
thinking
about
him
and
is
vexed
with
herself
for
doing
so
she
tries
to
stop
but
ca
if
she
knew
who
he
was
she
would
try
to
stop
she
let
herself
go
and
feel
she
was
living
in
a
beautiful
romance
so
she
is
living
in
a
romance
but
i
want
you
to
be
the
hero
of
it
not
your
anthony
fenton
that
why
i
do
open
her
eyes
to
the
game
that
going
on
the
man
is
a
perfect
devil
not
a
bad
devil
but
a
wild
devil
east
does
tell
monny
that
antoun
is
anthony
with
an
h
because
she
is
enjoying
the
thought
that
she
alone
knows
the
wonderful
truth
she
imagines
that
she
is
in
love
with
him
she
believes
fate
has
brought
them
together
that
he
is
a
reincarnation
as
she
is
and
that
they
ought
to
belong
to
each
other
well
let
them
she
is
more
than
six
or
seven
years
older
than
he
and
she
rich
though
poor
compared
to
monny
of
course
and
every
day
she
grows
handsomer
so
does
monny
as
for
rachel
guest
but
she
is
in
another
part
of
my
story
yet
no
come
to
think
of
it
i
bring
her
in
now
because
if
it
were
for
developments
concerning
that
young
woman
i
might
be
able
to
wait
one
more
day
without
begging
you
to
come
to
us
she
is
taking
monny
away
from
me
and
something
odd
is
going
on
i
ca
make
out
what
anyhow
that
horrid
bedr
el
gemály
is
in
it
and
there
to
be
a
climax
i
sure
night
you
get
this
letter
morning
for
i
writing
it
early
with
my
hair
down
my
back
and
my
coffee
not
ordered
though
i
starving
we
left
because
monny
wanted
to
live
for
a
few
days
in
a
hotel
close
to
the
nile
and
we
were
all
pleased
with
the
plan
for
this
was
once
a
palace
of
khedive
ismael
and
his
furniture
still
in
it
the
wildest
mixture
of
orientalized
french
taste
there
a
garden
with
paths
of
vermilion
sand
brought
from
somewhere
in
the
desert
but
the
most
convulsive
things
live
along
the
nile
valley
and
spend
their
nights
braying
hooting
cooing
whining
bellowing
and
barking
if
only
the
donkeys
and
dogs
and
birds
and
a
few
other
sacred
animals
of
egypt
would
be
a
little
more
reticent
especially
after
dark
the
country
would
be
faultless
but
what
with
worrying
myself
and
listening
to
furred
and
feathered
creatures
worrying
themselves
i
could
sleep
last
night
and
i
want
you
to
help
me
you
be
here
afternoon
and
i
shall
stay
in
to
receive
you
instead
of
going
to
the
bazaars
with
the
others
chaperoned
by
that
devil
of
yours
antoun
i
was
there
all
yesterday
watching
crowds
of
tourists
buy
beautiful
expensive
things
for
themselves
and
horrid
inexpensive
things
to
take
to
their
friends
cleopatra
purchased
some
disgracefully
cheap
pearls
no
would
be
seen
in
and
my
prophetic
soul
tells
me
that
she
going
to
try
and
dissolve
them
in
wine
there
to
be
a
fancy
dress
ball
at
this
hotel
night
or
rather
in
the
adjacent
casino
which
is
one
reason
we
migrated
here
and
praise
the
saints
you
be
in
time
for
it
because
if
going
to
happen
you
be
able
to
stop
whatever
it
is
if
i
were
supposed
to
know
that
antoun
was
anthony
fenton
i
might
take
him
into
my
counsels
as
it
is
i
ca
and
anyhow
it
would
do
much
good
at
present
because
a
silent
duel
is
going
on
between
him
and
monny
he
is
bent
on
compelling
her
to
acknowledge
his
authority
she
is
bent
on
resisting
it
which
is
a
great
compliment
to
his
power
but
he
know
that
for
he
does
know
monny
yet
it
would
be
fun
to
watch
them
together
if
i
had
your
interests
to
think
of
he
has
got
rid
of
bedr
el
gemály
but
he
would
have
done
so
sure
if
it
had
been
for
an
unexpected
turn
of
the
wheel
by
the
hand
of
fate
in
the
person
of
rachel
guest
her
hand
is
never
the
wheel
just
now
the
few
days
since
you
have
been
away
have
brought
out
the
true
inwardness
of
her
with
very
little
perhaps
it
the
air
of
egypt
which
is
having
a
really
extraordinary
effect
on
all
of
us
perhaps
it
the
fact
that
monny
has
given
rachel
a
lot
of
lovely
clothes
which
have
rejuvenated
and
apparently
revitalized
her
but
you
will
see
for
yourself
and
talk
things
over
with
your
old
friend
biddy
this
was
a
nice
letter
to
read
heaven
knew
how
many
hours
too
late
my
fatigue
had
slipped
off
like
the
skin
off
a
grape
i
felt
energetic
enough
to
start
out
and
walk
to
cairo
what
could
be
in
biddy
mind
and
what
must
she
have
thought
when
afternoon
and
evening
passed
without
even
a
telegram
the
evening
paper
if
she
had
happened
to
look
would
have
told
her
that
the
had
reached
alexandria
in
the
morning
as
she
expected
and
she
could
neither
have
guessed
nor
believed
that
the
whole
day
would
pass
without
my
having
a
chance
to
read
her
letter
i
ransacked
the
drawers
for
a
telegraph
form
and
finding
one
had
begun
to
address
it
when
i
stopped
the
message
could
not
go
out
until
morning
meanwhile
there
were
and
anthony
letters
to
read
one
or
both
might
give
me
some
clue
to
the
climax
biddy
feared
for
at
the
ball
i
cut
open
envelope
which
had
on
it
an
alluring
sunset
picture
of
the
pyramids
and
the
name
of
the
hotel
hastily
i
ran
through
the
pages
not
a
hint
of
anything
disquieting
if
i
had
read
her
letter
instead
of
brigit
i
might
have
gone
to
my
rest
without
a
qualm
dear
lord
ernest
miss
gilder
addressed
me
in
a
handwriting
which
to
any
expert
would
reveal
some
originality
more
pride
still
more
conscientiousness
any
amount
of
and
singularly
little
conceit
an
odd
combination
but
the
gilded
rose
is
that
she
went
on
you
asked
me
to
write
to
you
while
you
were
away
and
tell
you
the
news
and
what
i
thought
about
things
but
i
thinking
so
much
and
so
fast
that
i
ca
sort
out
my
thoughts
i
suppose
it
must
be
so
with
every
one
who
comes
to
egypt
for
the
first
time
everything
fascinates
and
absorbs
me
even
more
than
i
had
hoped
it
would
almost
too
much
i
feel
sometimes
your
antoun
effendi
is
a
very
good
guide
and
i
am
not
sorry
that
we
have
him
except
once
in
a
while
and
now
and
then
glad
we
proud
of
his
looks
when
we
go
about
for
every
one
stares
at
him
and
envies
us
for
having
him
to
take
us
about
instead
of
being
condemned
to
a
mere
dragoman
oh
talking
of
dragomen
you
see
i
call
them
that
we
still
have
bedr
though
i
know
you
thought
we
ought
to
give
him
up
and
i
do
see
how
we
are
ever
to
discharge
him
now
for
he
has
attached
himself
to
rachel
in
the
most
wonderful
way
it
is
it
began
with
a
talk
they
had
the
day
you
left
about
his
having
been
in
america
and
about
she
found
him
half
inclined
to
be
converted
and
of
course
her
goodness
and
unselfishness
made
her
long
to
snatch
him
like
a
brand
from
the
burning
he
thinks
no
one
ever
talked
so
wonderfully
about
religion
as
she
does
which
she
dear
thing
attributes
to
the
fact
that
she
taught
in
salem
she
says
if
she
can
have
him
to
work
upon
even
for
a
few
weeks
she
is
sure
to
make
him
a
convert
we
have
wasted
a
minute
since
you
went
away
but
have
seen
sights
from
morning
till
night
so
as
not
to
have
missed
anything
when
we
leave
cairo
on
the
i
hope
you
be
pleased
that
i
given
up
my
dream
of
having
a
private
dahabeah
and
that
we
shall
be
with
you
on
sir
marcus
lark
boat
she
is
really
a
beauty
antoun
took
us
over
her
and
on
board
we
met
sir
marcus
who
was
showing
some
friends
round
antoun
introduced
him
to
us
i
think
sir
asked
him
to
do
it
we
had
great
fun
for
sir
marcus
seemed
to
take
the
most
violent
fancy
to
aunt
clara
who
did
like
him
at
all
she
says
now
that
she
believes
when
she
was
cleopatra
he
was
caesar
and
that
it
a
pity
he
ca
wear
a
wreath
to
hide
his
baldness
as
she
remembers
his
doing
then
it
only
a
little
bald
spot
really
and
rachel
guest
says
it
reminds
her
of
a
tonsure
on
the
head
of
a
monk
aunt
quite
resents
sir
marcus
being
able
to
engage
the
services
of
you
and
antoun
she
wants
you
both
to
be
there
but
she
does
like
sir
to
have
a
superior
position
to
antoun
that
day
on
the
sir
invited
us
to
have
tea
on
the
deck
and
it
really
was
enchanting
a
deck
like
a
huge
drawingroom
or
one
of
our
biggest
verandas
at
newport
or
somewhere
with
jolly
green
wicker
chairs
and
tables
and
sofas
with
heaps
of
cushions
but
i
forgot
you
seen
the
boat
the
best
rooms
engaged
but
when
we
talked
to
sir
marcus
he
called
a
man
who
can
speak
many
languages
in
bits
broken
english
cracked
german
fractured
french
and
goodness
knows
what
all
between
them
they
arranged
it
somehow
that
we
should
have
our
choice
and
the
other
people
were
to
take
what
was
left
i
would
have
refused
because
it
did
seem
fair
but
it
was
for
aunt
clara
sake
evidently
that
sir
wanted
to
make
the
exchange
and
accepted
she
was
as
haughty
as
a
queen
but
in
rather
a
fascinating
soft
way
that
i
think
men
like
and
she
was
looking
beautiful
so
is
rachel
as
even
biddy
admits
i
do
believe
rachel
looks
younger
than
i
do
in
some
new
dresses
and
hats
she
has
i
never
noticed
before
but
i
fancy
now
that
we
rather
alike
i
so
delighted
to
see
her
enjoying
herself
so
much
for
you
know
think
what
courage
it
must
have
taken
to
break
with
her
tiresome
old
life
because
she
felt
she
must
see
the
glory
of
the
world
when
a
tiny
legacy
gave
her
the
chance
she
longed
for
she
would
have
had
a
penny
left
after
she
finished
her
trip
if
aunt
and
i
had
been
able
to
help
her
out
it
a
privilege
to
do
anything
for
such
a
brave
creature
and
i
ca
bear
to
think
of
her
having
to
go
back
when
this
is
over
to
the
dull
round
perhaps
some
way
out
will
be
found
for
her
i
fallen
in
love
with
cairo
although
or
perhaps
because
i
still
feel
as
if
i
were
moving
in
a
marvellous
picture
antoun
does
make
it
live
for
us
i
will
say
that
for
him
though
he
can
be
so
annoying
that
at
times
he
spoils
everything
and
makes
me
wish
you
won
my
hat
instead
of
my
winning
his
green
turban
i
dying
to
find
out
how
you
got
it
but
of
course
i
ca
ask
him
it
would
be
you
tell
me
when
you
come
i
think
the
one
he
wears
now
is
handsomer
though
i
wish
i
could
change
it
for
mine
we
have
been
to
heaps
of
mosques
and
i
ca
help
wishing
we
were
the
only
tourists
in
cairo
of
course
this
is
a
selfish
wish
and
as
dear
biddy
says
it
quite
funny
to
think
how
each
tourist
feels
that
is
the
only
imaginative
person
travelling
that
he
alone
has
the
right
to
be
in
egypt
that
all
the
others
are
offensive
vulgar
creatures
who
desecrate
the
beautiful
places
with
their
presence
but
really
you
know
it
gets
on
one
nerves
meeting
droves
of
silly
men
in
pith
helmets
with
little
white
lambrequins
looped
up
when
it
would
be
so
much
more
appropriate
to
wear
the
kind
of
hats
they
have
at
home
and
some
of
the
women
are
they
have
the
queerest
ideas
of
what
is
suitable
for
egypt
one
friend
of
bedr
refused
to
go
about
and
be
seen
with
the
ladies
who
engaged
him
as
he
was
the
smartest
dragoman
in
cairo
and
had
his
reputation
to
keep
up
do
you
that
even
antoun
laughed
which
he
hardly
ever
does
he
so
dignified
i
wish
his
turban
would
blow
off
or
something
i
how
he
look
without
it
and
if
most
of
the
charm
would
be
gone
almost
i
hope
so
one
does
like
to
catch
one
self
feeling
toward
an
egyptian
even
for
a
minute
as
one
does
toward
men
of
one
own
blood
i
mean
on
the
same
level
or
even
as
if
a
person
like
that
were
one
it
just
the
picturesque
dignity
of
the
and
the
perhaps
and
then
this
strange
glamour
of
the
east
is
over
everybody
and
everything
here
i
used
to
wonder
why
people
wrote
and
spoke
of
the
east
as
why
should
it
be
more
mysterious
than
the
west
i
would
ask
nobody
could
explain
exactly
they
said
only
it
is
now
i
know
why
at
least
i
why
without
his
green
turban
or
in
european
coat
instead
of
his
graceful
silk
robe
and
away
from
these
luminous
sunsets
of
pale
rose
and
gold
and
emerald
antoun
would
be
nothing
extraordinary
would
he
he
says
he
is
considered
old
fashioned
in
his
way
of
dress
most
of
his
friends
wear
european
clothes
and
the
tarboosh
which
egyptians
love
because
it
never
blows
away
or
falls
off
when
they
pray
he
make
me
angry
because
he
wants
to
banish
the
beggars
and
poor
men
who
sell
things
in
the
street
instead
of
letting
me
give
and
buy
what
am
i
with
all
my
money
except
to
do
things
for
people
and
it
such
fun
making
them
happy
by
saying
i
a
or
a
scarab
or
whatever
they
have
instead
of
pushing
past
with
a
stony
glare
as
if
they
were
dust
under
our
feet
of
course
we
attended
by
great
crowds
whereever
we
go
because
it
got
round
that
we
do
refuse
any
one
consequently
it
takes
a
long
to
arrive
anywhere
but
what
does
that
matter
in
egypt
already
i
losing
my
american
hustle
i
want
to
eat
lotuses
which
seem
out
of
season
in
egypt
now
i
asked
for
them
everywhere
but
ca
get
them
i
want
to
feel
back
in
the
middle
ages
in
cairo
which
as
antoun
says
is
an
oriental
and
medieval
gateway
to
the
egypt
older
than
history
and
how
i
am
looking
forward
to
the
sir
marcus
tells
us
that
are
to
take
the
people
of
the
for
a
desert
trip
before
they
go
up
the
nile
so
of
course
you
must
count
us
among
your
trippers
and
willis
and
sheridan
who
have
settled
to
go
on
the
you
did
mention
the
desert
plan
before
you
went
away
no
news
of
that
poor
beautiful
child
wretched
bey
wife
though
written
twice
i
worried
about
her
mabel
she
used
to
be
now
mabella
hânem
biddy
says
you
arrive
for
the
ball
night
but
somehow
i
do
you
will
i
do
know
why
you
should
men
do
care
for
such
things
much
and
of
course
i
shall
not
dance
as
i
still
in
half
mourning
i
shall
only
look
on
and
then
rachel
and
i
have
an
amusing
plan
for
the
end
of
the
evening
but
even
if
you
came
we
could
let
you
into
the
secret
as
you
would
think
it
silly
yours
sincerely
rosamond
gilder
mine
sincerely
rosamond
gilder
so
she
ended
her
letter
with
youthful
and
characteristic
dignity
childishly
unaware
apparently
that
there
was
more
to
read
between
the
lines
than
in
the
lines
themselves
had
i
read
this
rosamond
letter
first
the
last
four
or
five
sentences
would
have
meant
little
for
me
as
it
was
i
would
have
given
a
month
out
of
my
future
for
the
gift
of
an
astral
body
which
could
go
this
minute
to
the
ball
at
the
ghezireh
palace
i
was
lost
in
the
mystery
of
that
amusing
plan
in
anthony
letter
lay
my
last
hope
of
a
clue
but
in
it
there
was
none
he
did
not
even
mention
monny
name
it
was
all
about
that
desert
trip
which
from
her
i
had
taken
seriously
sir
marcus
was
actually
planning
it
kruger
had
written
that
some
of
the
passengers
were
clamouring
for
a
few
days
camping
and
the
idea
was
to
send
them
off
in
my
care
after
three
days
in
cairo
while
the
others
remained
in
charge
of
antoun
who
was
yet
ready
to
leave
fenton
said
somebody
trying
to
defeat
my
scheme
for
getting
the
sheikh
tomb
moved
i
do
know
who
it
is
yet
meanwhile
my
time
and
my
head
are
so
full
that
in
the
few
hours
of
the
night
i
put
aside
for
sleep
i
dream
queerer
dreams
than
the
visits
of
ghostly
sheikhs
apropos
of
dreams
do
you
know
by
chance
a
man
who
answers
this
description
elderly
stoutish
red
face
gray
hair
black
moustache
pale
eyes
with
sharp
look
in
them
sounds
commonplace
does
it
but
i
have
a
recurring
dream
of
such
a
man
whose
face
i
never
saw
elsewhere
for
the
last
three
nights
as
soon
as
i
shut
my
eyes
he
comes
he
seems
to
interrupt
some
scene
between
you
and
lark
and
myself
and
i
see
him
looking
over
lark
shoulder
then
he
turns
quickly
away
and
tiptoes
off
to
a
very
low
closed
door
in
a
deep
recess
there
he
disappears
into
shadow
and
i
wake
up
with
a
jump
or
slide
off
into
another
dream
but
generally
this
rouses
me
for
an
impression
of
something
stealthy
in
the
shadow
round
the
door
that
so
ordinary
a
type
of
person
should
be
in
a
dream
you
laugh
at
my
asking
if
you
ever
known
such
a
man
and
say
that
i
back
at
my
old
tricks
again
as
a
dreamer
of
dreams
never
mind
i
scored
dreaming
of
our
mountain
of
the
golden
pyramid
the
night
before
i
got
your
letter
with
ferlini
papers
i
ca
help
feeling
that
there
may
be
something
in
dreams
in
mine
anyhow
though
i
never
have
any
except
in
egypt
this
one
about
the
man
and
the
closed
door
in
the
deep
recess
is
getting
a
bit
on
my
nerves
excited
as
i
was
over
the
patchwork
of
news
i
laughed
scornfully
at
anthony
dream
for
the
man
he
described
might
be
colonel
corkran
chapter
x
the
secret
monny
kept
cairo
at
last
my
watch
said
that
the
journey
took
only
three
hours
but
my
nerves
said
six
i
had
telegraphed
biddy
first
thing
in
the
morning
the
hour
of
my
arrival
with
the
and
i
half
expected
to
see
her
at
the
big
white
and
red
station
but
there
was
no
familiar
form
in
the
throng
the
gay
throng
which
excited
my
charges
everything
interested
them
the
black
face
of
the
sudanese
engine
driver
who
looked
down
from
his
huge
british
locomotive
the
display
of
english
french
and
german
literature
mingled
with
greek
italian
arab
or
turkish
papers
on
the
bookstall
the
ebony
and
luggage
carriers
who
seemed
eager
to
take
one
another
lives
but
in
reality
desired
no
more
than
to
snatch
each
other
jobs
under
the
eyes
of
the
uniformed
to
me
the
busy
place
was
a
desert
lacking
one
face
even
outside
the
and
in
the
streets
and
squares
where
silent
camels
looked
their
contempt
of
electric
trams
soldiers
in
khaki
uniforms
jostled
bedouins
in
khaki
robes
and
drivers
of
arabeahs
made
the
way
one
long
procession
of
shrieks
i
still
glanced
at
passing
carriages
in
hopes
of
a
belated
biddy
all
in
vain
and
destitute
of
news
i
resigned
myself
to
the
task
of
piloting
the
set
out
to
mena
house
the
moon
would
be
full
that
night
and
it
the
thing
to
be
a
neighbour
of
the
sphinx
while
the
moon
feeds
her
with
honey
the
flock
under
the
guidance
of
watts
had
now
definitely
parted
from
the
set
chieftained
by
me
they
went
meekly
off
to
the
cheaper
hotels
where
they
would
live
before
boarding
the
again
for
palestine
and
colonel
corkran
who
was
supposed
to
have
joined
that
party
had
announced
that
he
was
bound
for
a
long
talk
with
mark
the
lark
watts
refused
by
enid
biddell
and
separated
from
her
had
relapsed
into
melancholia
he
had
ceased
to
brilliantine
his
once
sleek
hair
and
dust
and
crumbs
were
allowed
to
collect
in
each
fold
of
his
clerical
waistcoat
as
we
of
the
set
buzzed
richly
away
in
taxicabs
i
saw
him
in
a
shabby
arabeah
between
two
old
ladies
gazing
wistfully
after
us
he
was
envying
me
enid
it
is
a
wonderful
drive
through
cairo
to
the
pyramids
whether
you
spin
out
there
in
a
motor
or
trot
on
a
donkey
or
lilt
on
a
camel
squatting
on
a
load
of
green
bersím
past
the
great
swinging
bridge
and
the
island
of
ghezireh
the
word
that
in
itself
means
island
begins
the
dyke
which
is
the
road
made
by
ismaïl
to
please
the
empress
eugénie
since
her
visit
in
the
days
when
the
suez
canal
was
opened
it
has
pleased
two
empresses
and
more
queens
than
i
have
time
to
count
under
the
deep
shade
of
lebbek
trees
it
goes
on
and
on
toward
the
pyramids
a
dark
cool
avenue
high
above
cultivated
fields
flooded
by
the
nile
when
the
river
is
up
the
emerald
waves
of
grain
flow
like
green
water
to
the
foot
of
the
broad
and
canals
like
long
blue
ribbons
are
threaded
through
it
their
ends
lost
to
sight
at
the
shimmering
horizon
even
at
this
noon
hour
when
the
world
should
have
been
eating
lotuses
or
luncheon
the
interminable
arbour
was
crowded
with
strings
of
camels
forever
going
both
ways
into
cairo
and
out
one
wondered
why
and
there
were
flocks
of
woolly
brown
sheep
and
donkeys
drawing
sideless
carts
in
which
whole
families
of
veiled
women
and
children
were
seated
tailor
fashion
on
we
spun
past
the
zoo
past
scattered
villas
of
frenchified
oriental
fashion
which
might
have
been
designed
by
a
confectioner
past
azure
lakes
left
by
the
ebbing
nile
and
so
into
sudden
dazzling
sight
of
three
geometric
mountains
in
a
tawny
desert
two
monsters
in
size
and
one
a
baby
trying
to
catch
up
with
them
oh
everybody
breathed
for
these
things
were
beyond
words
then
in
a
moment
more
the
great
pyramid
had
grown
so
big
that
it
loomed
over
us
and
ate
up
half
the
sky
a
pyre
of
yellow
flame
against
a
flame
of
blue
we
were
at
the
end
of
the
shadowy
road
that
leads
like
a
causeway
to
the
desert
and
on
the
verge
of
the
golden
billowing
sea
which
flows
round
the
pyramids
and
engulfs
the
distant
sphinx
oriental
life
encircled
us
in
the
foreground
of
the
picture
a
long
row
of
waiting
camels
gaily
saddled
and
tasselled
delicately
nibbling
bersím
green
as
heaped
emeralds
donkeys
white
and
gray
beribboned
and
beaded
small
yellow
sandcarts
little
white
desert
horses
and
tall
brown
desert
men
camels
snarling
donkeys
braying
horses
whinnying
and
men
touting
very
nice
sandcarts
very
nice
camels
take
ladies
and
gentlemen
quick
to
pyramids
and
sphinx
or
petrified
forest
farther
on
the
big
modern
hotel
rather
like
an
overgrown
swiss
chalet
built
by
arabs
a
vast
confused
building
the
colour
of
sand
or
brown
heather
honey
with
carved
mushrbiyeh
work
lending
an
eastern
charm
to
windows
balconies
and
loggias
and
enough
green
flowery
garden
to
give
a
sensational
effect
of
contrast
with
the
tidal
wave
of
desert
poised
ready
it
would
seem
to
overwhelm
palms
and
roses
clustered
near
the
tiny
mushroom
village
which
huddles
under
the
shelter
of
pyramid
beyond
the
immense
upward
sweep
of
golden
dunes
culminating
in
the
great
pyramid
itself
i
stayed
in
the
picture
only
long
enough
to
settle
my
big
children
into
their
quarters
and
to
see
most
of
them
making
for
the
agreeably
oriental
with
its
white
and
red
walls
its
dome
and
windows
of
mushrbiyeh
work
then
i
darted
back
to
cairo
in
a
taxi
driven
by
a
nubian
youth
so
black
that
he
was
almost
blue
like
a
whortleberry
he
wore
a
scarlet
tarboosh
a
livery
of
violet
and
the
holes
for
silver
rings
in
the
tops
of
his
ears
were
so
large
that
the
light
shining
through
gave
the
effect
of
inserted
diamonds
unconsciously
he
made
a
nice
contrast
with
his
modern
motor
he
drove
with
such
reckless
speed
that
camels
to
look
at
us
and
whirled
me
past
the
fat
black
into
the
ghezireh
palace
garden
of
scarlet
paths
moonlike
lamps
khedivial
statues
and
spreading
banyans
where
each
tree
continued
itself
in
its
own
next
number
like
an
endless
serial
romance
i
nearly
asked
for
but
turned
her
into
jones
at
the
danger
point
the
face
of
the
concierge
as
he
said
that
she
was
at
home
conveyed
nothing
yet
i
could
not
resist
adding
are
the
ladies
well
east
is
not
very
well
he
replied
we
have
had
the
doctor
but
the
young
ladies
have
been
out
spending
the
night
with
friends
i
believe
they
have
not
yet
returned
it
was
a
long
five
minutes
before
biddy
and
i
were
wildly
shaking
hands
in
a
huge
private
all
brocade
and
crystal
chandeliers
as
it
had
been
in
the
days
of
ismaïl
i
knew
i
should
be
delighted
to
see
her
but
i
did
realize
that
it
was
going
to
be
quite
as
good
as
it
was
anyhow
all
right
and
safe
i
heard
myself
blurt
out
i
safe
but
not
all
right
she
reproached
me
my
messenger
who
went
to
the
train
did
find
you
from
my
description
i
know
because
he
came
back
with
my
note
too
flattering
was
your
description
or
the
other
way
i
asked
trying
to
buoy
her
up
with
frivolity
you
would
joke
if
you
read
the
note
oh
ernest
monny
and
rachel
have
disappeared
good
gracious
but
anthony
he
went
to
look
for
them
of
course
and
he
disappeared
too
by
jove
the
exclamation
sounded
inadequate
but
i
was
so
taken
aback
that
i
had
nothing
else
to
say
it
seemed
impossible
that
anthony
instead
of
averting
danger
could
be
involved
in
it
himself
it
was
unlike
his
resourcefulness
i
could
not
believe
it
of
him
and
so
when
i
had
time
to
control
mind
and
tongue
i
said
as
much
to
biddy
yes
i
felt
like
that
too
at
first
she
admitted
he
gives
one
the
impression
of
being
so
infallible
in
any
emergency
somehow
as
if
be
above
it
and
look
down
on
it
from
his
height
but
it
more
than
twelve
hours
since
he
went
and
he
promised
to
send
me
word
how
things
were
going
on
if
he
could
get
to
me
himself
no
word
has
come
what
have
you
done
i
asked
have
you
communicated
with
the
police
sir
marcus
lark
has
he
was
at
the
ball
and
has
been
very
good
but
it
for
east
sake
mostly
one
feels
he
glad
it
happened
to
give
him
the
chance
to
win
her
gratitude
or
something
he
been
back
and
forth
all
day
and
i
expecting
him
any
minute
east
has
been
fainting
and
hysterical
and
everything
early
edwardian
so
i
sent
for
a
doctor
but
she
better
on
the
strength
of
and
eggnog
and
she
promised
to
see
sir
marcus
now
tell
me
what
happened
from
the
beginning
i
said
when
i
had
made
biddy
sit
down
by
me
on
the
sofa
and
was
trying
to
warm
a
cold
little
hand
in
mine
what
it
all
amounted
to
told
disjointedly
was
this
since
monny
had
had
an
inspiration
the
day
after
our
arrival
in
cairo
to
give
rachel
guest
a
lot
of
her
new
unworn
clothes
rachel
had
become
quite
girlish
and
flighty
she
had
lost
her
puritan
primness
and
behaved
more
in
accordance
with
her
slanting
eyes
than
with
her
bringing
up
she
giggled
like
a
schoolgirl
rather
than
a
schoolmistress
tried
to
make
herself
look
young
and
copied
monny
in
the
way
she
tilted
her
hat
and
dressed
her
hair
no
harm
in
this
but
it
had
seemed
to
biddy
that
rachel
deliberately
incited
the
girl
to
do
things
which
antoun
disapproved
brigit
fancied
that
bedr
influence
had
been
at
work
for
knowing
as
he
did
that
antoun
would
gladly
have
given
him
marching
orders
he
took
pleasure
in
thwarting
his
superior
when
he
could
do
so
with
safety
bedr
had
been
clever
in
enlisting
the
girls
sympathy
for
his
soul
as
for
biddy
she
had
disliked
him
from
the
first
and
imagined
that
he
had
tacked
himself
onto
our
party
as
a
spy
upon
the
receipt
of
orders
from
america
he
having
learned
most
of
his
english
there
the
idea
appeared
so
that
she
had
abandoned
it
now
however
it
was
again
hovering
at
the
back
of
her
mind
bedr
had
told
rachel
stories
of
the
fascination
of
hasheesh
smoking
and
had
said
that
no
stranger
knew
cairo
who
did
not
visit
one
of
the
best
houses
where
hasheesh
though
forbidden
was
still
secretly
smoked
he
had
assured
her
that
there
were
several
which
were
perfectly
respectable
even
for
the
nicest
ladies
and
gentlemen
and
rachel
probably
at
his
suggestion
had
tried
to
persuade
monny
to
make
the
expedition
monny
had
mentioned
it
to
antoun
in
the
presence
of
everybody
and
as
rachel
and
bedr
had
looked
guilty
biddy
guessed
that
they
had
wished
to
keep
the
plan
a
secret
antoun
had
perhaps
too
brusquely
vetoed
the
idea
he
said
that
there
were
no
such
houses
which
could
be
visited
by
ladies
and
that
it
was
absurd
to
think
of
going
that
word
absurd
stung
monny
she
began
to
protest
that
bedr
knew
cairo
as
well
as
antoun
did
and
was
as
likely
to
be
right
i
do
see
why
we
should
go
if
others
do
she
persisted
and
i
always
longed
to
know
what
a
hasheesh
dream
was
like
ever
since
i
read
de
quincey
a
little
just
once
could
do
us
no
harm
and
rachel
says
but
what
rachel
had
said
was
evidently
not
for
publication
miss
guest
stopped
her
with
a
hand
on
hers
and
a
monny
please
do
let
us
think
of
it
any
more
if
antoun
effendi
disapproves
maybe
it
was
a
silly
idea
and
we
plenty
of
amusing
things
to
do
every
minute
monny
was
apparently
contented
to
let
the
idea
slip
and
brigit
had
thought
that
in
the
excitement
of
getting
ready
for
the
ball
she
and
rachel
had
really
forgotten
it
then
before
writing
me
she
had
overheard
rachel
say
to
her
friend
it
for
twelve
sharp
and
monny
had
answered
wo
it
be
does
bedr
think
but
she
had
stopped
short
at
sight
of
brigit
even
this
did
not
suggest
to
biddy
a
visit
to
a
hasheesh
den
for
various
other
plans
had
been
broached
and
discouraged
by
antoun
she
did
not
feel
that
as
she
was
not
supposed
to
know
his
real
status
she
could
go
blabbing
to
him
and
fearing
that
mischief
was
on
foot
she
had
wished
for
me
when
i
did
arrive
she
soothed
herself
by
reflecting
that
after
all
she
need
only
keep
a
sharp
watch
over
monny
when
midnight
drew
near
none
of
the
party
intended
to
dance
and
so
it
would
be
easy
brigit
thought
to
have
an
eye
upon
the
girls
monny
had
bought
oriental
costumes
for
herself
and
rachel
they
were
rather
conspicuous
luckily
for
biddy
plan
for
among
the
many
gorgeous
dresses
in
the
casino
she
had
no
difficulty
in
tracking
those
two
until
half
past
eleven
she
told
herself
she
need
not
be
on
the
alert
every
instant
but
therein
had
lain
her
mistake
sir
marcus
lark
had
appeared
dressed
more
or
less
as
a
roman
officer
of
the
occupation
days
he
having
heard
east
remark
that
whatever
said
it
was
her
favourite
period
the
lady
of
course
had
not
missed
such
an
opportunity
to
appear
as
cleopatra
she
had
brought
a
costume
with
her
from
new
york
and
while
biddy
lost
herself
in
watching
the
effect
of
this
magnificence
on
sir
marcus
the
girls
vanished
without
alarming
east
brigit
had
begun
to
search
she
asked
everybody
she
knew
in
the
ballroom
if
the
girls
had
gone
out
and
inquired
in
the
cloakroom
but
the
two
had
been
seen
by
nobody
it
was
as
if
they
had
melted
into
air
and
brigit
began
to
suspect
that
they
must
have
covered
up
their
brilliant
dresses
with
dominoes
smuggled
into
the
casino
willis
bailey
was
at
the
ball
but
he
had
developed
a
flirtation
with
miss
guest
and
biddy
felt
that
he
was
not
to
be
trusted
as
a
confidant
perhaps
too
he
had
helped
the
girls
to
disappear
it
seemed
cruel
to
frighten
east
when
the
scheme
whatever
it
was
might
be
no
more
than
an
innocent
freak
so
biddy
said
nothing
to
queen
cleopatra
or
her
roman
attendant
she
slipped
across
the
garden
to
the
hotel
and
sent
an
arab
messenger
off
in
a
taxi
with
a
note
to
the
address
antoun
had
told
her
would
find
him
in
less
than
an
hour
he
arrived
and
when
he
had
listened
to
her
account
of
what
had
happened
he
said
after
a
minute
reflection
that
the
ladies
had
almost
surely
gone
with
bedr
to
some
hasheesh
den
or
a
place
masquerading
as
such
antoun
consoled
biddy
as
well
as
he
could
by
saying
that
no
harm
would
come
to
miss
gilder
or
miss
guest
bedr
would
know
too
well
on
which
side
his
bread
was
buttered
to
take
his
clients
where
insult
or
danger
could
reach
them
off
antoun
went
to
look
for
the
missing
ones
though
and
assured
biddy
that
she
should
have
news
as
soon
as
possible
it
was
not
till
three
that
she
had
begun
to
be
very
anxious
and
had
disturbed
the
harmony
of
sir
marcus
lark
duet
with
east
even
then
she
would
not
have
spoken
had
she
not
feared
that
the
ball
would
break
up
and
there
would
be
no
man
to
appeal
to
sir
marcus
had
been
inclined
to
smile
at
the
notion
of
danger
but
he
like
anthony
fenton
was
ignorant
of
any
private
qualms
which
troubled
brigit
she
could
not
tell
him
who
she
was
and
that
she
considered
herself
far
from
being
a
mascot
to
her
if
she
had
told
and
added
that
she
feared
enemies
who
might
for
certain
reasons
make
a
mistake
in
monny
identity
he
would
have
laughed
his
hearty
laugh
and
said
that
such
melodramatic
things
happen
even
in
egypt
but
know
biddy
appealed
to
me
that
melodramatic
things
happened
to
me
and
those
near
me
i
not
even
that
poor
richard
death
was
natural
though
i
watched
over
him
like
a
hawk
in
those
dreadful
days
when
he
was
fearing
every
shadow
and
we
were
flitting
from
pillar
to
post
with
esmé
through
richard
two
men
were
electrocuted
he
used
to
get
threatening
letters
forwarded
from
place
to
place
always
signed
with
the
same
initials
and
he
would
tell
me
what
they
meant
it
was
because
of
them
that
he
hid
esmé
in
a
before
he
died
for
she
was
threatened
as
well
as
he
i
too
for
the
matter
of
that
not
that
the
child
or
i
had
done
the
organization
any
harm
but
esmé
is
of
his
blood
and
they
may
have
thought
i
had
more
of
their
secrets
than
i
really
have
i
not
used
the
name
of
for
years
now
and
i
moved
about
so
much
that
sometimes
i
have
felt
i
must
be
safe
still
i
ought
perhaps
not
to
have
gone
to
visit
esmé
though
she
wrote
and
begged
me
to
for
special
reasons
i
need
bother
you
with
a
curious
little
love
romance
which
i
fear
must
end
badly
i
did
think
of
danger
to
monny
but
you
see
as
i
told
you
the
convent
is
far
from
monaco
i
got
off
the
there
to
visit
esmé
and
when
i
came
on
board
again
monny
and
east
and
rachel
came
with
me
they
been
in
italy
and
france
and
had
picked
up
miss
guest
who
was
only
too
enchanted
to
batten
on
monny
kindness
and
dollars
it
was
i
who
had
engaged
their
staterooms
on
a
cable
from
monny
long
before
and
if
there
were
a
spy
anywhere
he
might
have
the
idea
that
i
wanted
to
smuggle
esmé
out
of
her
convent
by
a
trick
and
but
almost
every
one
must
know
miss
gilder
face
from
her
photographs
in
newspapers
i
broke
in
on
a
stifled
sob
of
biddy
she
be
mistaken
for
another
girl
as
an
unimportant
young
person
might
i
not
sure
those
photographs
were
snapshots
and
very
bad
as
you
must
know
if
you
ever
seen
any
monny
never
gave
a
portrait
of
herself
to
a
newspaper
and
it
years
since
they
got
hold
of
a
good
one
besides
if
she
were
mistaken
for
esmé
that
wretched
bedr
might
have
made
up
a
plot
to
have
her
kidnapped
for
ransom
it
was
the
thing
monny
father
was
always
afraid
of
absurdly
afraid
of
i
to
think
i
think
so
still
i
said
such
things
do
happen
anywhere
to
a
girl
what
about
raisuli
in
tangier
biddy
challenged
me
he
used
to
kidnap
people
whenever
he
liked
and
so
do
lots
of
brigands
we
have
to
do
with
brigands
oh
what
in
a
name
and
i
would
put
past
that
horrid
bedr
as
anthony
said
to
you
he
knows
which
side
his
bread
buttered
but
if
he
hopes
some
one
will
give
him
more
butter
for
being
wicked
than
he
can
get
from
us
for
being
good
let
not
think
of
contingencies
dear
said
i
now
you
told
me
all
i
will
try
to
do
something
may
i
come
in
boomed
a
big
voice
at
the
door
i
knocked
and
nobody
answered
so
i
thought
the
room
would
be
empty
biddy
dropped
my
hand
like
a
hot
potato
she
had
jumped
up
so
quickly
from
our
sofa
that
sir
marcus
lark
observant
eyes
could
hardly
have
seen
us
sitting
there
together
of
course
come
in
she
said
have
you
anything
to
tell
but
call
east
she
wo
like
you
to
begin
without
her
biddy
darted
off
to
an
adjoining
room
leaving
me
alone
with
my
employer
what
do
you
think
of
this
affair
i
wanted
to
know
well
said
he
i
can
only
judge
other
men
by
myself
if
i
had
such
a
chance
to
appear
a
hero
in
the
eyes
of
a
pretty
woman
as
fenton
has
i
afraid
i
be
tempted
to
take
advantage
of
it
even
if
i
had
to
play
some
trick
to
make
myself
indispensable
now
you
see
in
a
nutshell
what
i
think
captain
fenton
will
certainly
rescue
those
young
ladies
from
a
trap
if
he
has
to
make
the
trap
himself
i
was
disgusted
and
shrugged
my
shoulders
you
have
a
poor
opinion
of
fenton
i
said
on
the
contrary
i
think
very
highly
of
his
intelligence
i
not
worrying
about
any
one
of
the
three
though
do
mention
it
to
east
or
jones
that
i
said
so
i
come
to
tell
them
that
my
men
have
searched
cairo
and
found
nothing
not
the
police
you
know
i
have
applied
to
the
police
after
all
i
thought
fenton
would
be
furious
and
anyhow
it
might
make
talk
but
i
paid
the
best
dragomans
in
town
to
look
sharp
and
they
know
as
much
about
this
old
place
as
the
police
do
if
not
more
by
the
way
lord
ernest
did
corkran
say
anything
to
you
about
an
intention
to
throw
over
his
job
on
the
no
he
said
he
was
going
to
call
on
you
that
all
he
did
call
i
was
out
on
this
business
as
it
happens
he
waited
and
i
found
him
making
himself
at
home
in
my
which
i
use
as
a
kind
of
office
i
wish
i
knew
how
many
of
my
letters
and
papers
he
had
time
to
read
surely
he
would
i
should
say
was
the
word
i
gone
out
in
a
hurry
and
left
things
scattered
about
which
is
my
habit
when
i
came
back
it
struck
me
that
my
desk
looked
a
bit
tempting
for
a
man
with
a
retired
conscience
i
was
going
to
keep
him
on
the
rather
than
fuss
because
it
was
so
much
his
fault
as
mine
that
he
was
the
wrong
man
in
the
place
he
could
do
any
harm
in
jerusalem
it
seemed
let
him
wail
in
the
jews
wailing
place
if
he
any
complaints
said
i
to
myself
i
thought
he
was
too
keen
on
money
to
resign
because
his
silly
pride
was
hurt
but
to
my
surprise
he
informed
me
that
he
come
to
in
his
papers
as
he
called
it
so
much
the
worse
for
his
pocket
and
the
better
for
mine
only
it
struck
me
as
d
d
queer
considering
corkran
character
i
wanted
to
ask
if
he
spit
out
any
venom
to
you
not
a
drop
said
i
but
i
too
thought
it
queer
considering
corkran
character
and
the
fact
that
having
resigned
of
his
own
free
will
he
could
hardly
expect
lark
to
pay
his
way
home
it
even
occurred
to
me
to
wonder
if
the
resignation
were
not
a
sudden
thought
of
the
colonel
he
had
spoken
several
times
of
going
on
to
palestine
and
had
mentioned
the
trip
that
morning
had
sir
marcus
said
something
inadvertently
which
had
so
piqued
corkran
that
he
threw
over
his
appointment
on
the
impulse
or
had
he
perhaps
been
dishonourable
enough
to
glance
at
a
letter
in
which
lark
referred
to
him
in
terms
uncomplimentary
as
i
asked
myself
these
questions
east
came
in
with
brigit
and
sir
marcus
forgot
me
his
face
said
what
a
woman
and
anxiety
was
becoming
to
cleopatra
it
gave
to
her
that
thrilling
look
which
only
beautiful
jewesses
or
women
of
latin
race
ever
wear
a
look
of
all
the
tragedy
and
mystery
of
womanhood
since
eve
what
news
of
she
asked
sir
marcus
when
she
had
given
a
ringed
hand
and
an
glance
to
me
no
news
exactly
said
the
big
man
but
i
feel
sure
your
niece
and
her
friend
are
safe
my
niece
and
her
friend
exclaimed
cleopatra
ungratefully
frowning
why
do
you
say
nothing
of
does
nobody
care
what
becomes
of
him
as
she
spoke
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
one
of
the
arab
servants
of
the
hotel
announced
that
a
man
had
a
letter
for
jones
mrs
jones
cried
biddy
i
am
jones
where
the
letter
that
man
not
give
it
to
us
he
say
he
see
you
or
not
give
it
at
all
well
why
did
you
send
him
up
arab
mans
not
let
in
hotel
if
peoples
do
ask
for
them
an
arab
not
not
is
he
a
stranger
yes
missis
very
low
man
never
comed
before
bring
him
here
quick
five
minutes
passed
we
tried
to
talk
but
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
then
the
servant
returned
ushering
in
a
dwarfish
arab
in
a
dirty
white
turban
and
the
shabby
black
galabeah
worn
only
by
the
poor
who
can
not
afford
good
materials
and
the
bright
colours
loved
by
egyptians
from
antoun
effendi
asked
biddy
in
excitement
as
he
held
out
a
piece
of
folded
paper
not
in
an
envelope
the
man
shook
his
head
he
spik
no
english
explained
the
servant
who
waited
talk
to
him
biddy
appealed
to
me
while
cleopatra
told
the
hotel
footman
that
he
might
go
but
i
had
no
time
to
question
the
messenger
biddy
cried
out
as
she
unfolded
the
paper
why
duffer
inside
it
addressed
to
you
it
says
lord
ernest
borrow
to
be
opened
by
jones
in
his
absence
within
the
outer
wrapping
was
a
second
folded
paper
of
the
same
kind
they
looked
like
sheets
torn
from
a
notebook
and
i
saw
that
the
address
scrawled
in
pencil
was
in
anthony
handwriting
chapter
xi
the
house
of
the
crocodile
the
letter
had
evidently
been
dashed
off
in
a
great
hurry
it
was
short
and
written
in
french
the
language
in
which
antoun
chose
to
talk
with
foreigners
give
the
bearer
two
hundred
piastres
and
let
him
go
do
try
to
make
him
speak
i
have
promised
this
then
quick
to
jarvis
pasha
and
get
him
to
raid
the
house
of
the
crocodile
question
of
hasheesh
we
must
be
smuggled
out
when
arrests
are
made
also
bedr
to
save
scandal
not
a
word
as
to
whether
all
were
safe
or
in
danger
but
i
realized
that
for
some
reason
each
instant
had
been
of
value
and
each
instant
was
of
value
now
anthony
was
one
who
knew
precisely
what
he
wanted
and
why
he
wanted
it
i
obeyed
his
instructions
implicitly
two
hundred
piastres
went
from
my
pocket
into
the
hand
of
the
withered
arab
and
he
was
allowed
to
take
his
departure
despite
a
burst
of
protest
from
my
companions
who
naturally
wished
the
man
to
be
catechised
once
the
door
had
shut
behind
the
bent
blue
back
i
handed
round
the
letter
which
had
to
be
translated
for
sir
marcus
who
professed
contempt
for
foreign
gibberish
jarvis
pasha
is
at
the
head
of
the
police
has
been
for
many
years
and
is
the
most
interesting
man
in
egypt
after
the
leaving
sir
marcus
to
go
on
with
his
task
of
consoling
east
i
dashed
off
in
my
waiting
taxi
with
the
nubian
of
the
silver
earrings
we
drove
to
the
governorat
a
big
house
in
a
square
near
what
was
once
known
as
the
guarded
city
the
very
heart
and
birthspot
of
cairo
masrel
kahira
the
martial
founded
under
the
planet
mars
i
scribbled
a
line
to
jarvis
pasha
and
sent
it
to
him
in
an
envelope
with
my
card
this
combination
opened
doors
for
me
and
three
minutes
later
i
was
shaking
hands
with
a
tall
thin
white
moustached
englishman
who
looked
all
muscle
and
bones
and
brain
jarvis
pasha
being
in
the
secret
of
antoun
identity
and
business
in
cairo
simplified
the
explanation
and
did
away
with
the
necessity
for
a
preface
all
i
had
to
tell
was
the
brief
story
of
the
disappearance
with
bedr
el
gemály
and
fenton
following
them
into
space
then
how
word
had
come
after
fourteen
hours
the
house
of
the
crocodile
jarvis
pasha
said
when
he
had
taken
and
read
the
letter
h
do
you
know
anything
about
that
house
i
know
the
old
stories
connected
with
it
i
answered
if
reputation
is
as
sinister
as
ever
not
at
all
figuratively
speaking
it
has
been
whitewashed
it
become
a
show
place
monument
this
is
interesting
information
which
fenton
sends
but
if
it
came
from
any
one
else
i
should
say
he
had
dreamed
it
he
may
be
giving
us
the
chance
of
an
important
wait
a
few
minutes
and
i
have
this
thing
attended
to
lord
ernest
but
you
look
upset
is
it
that
you
have
had
lunch
or
are
you
worrying
about
the
ladies
both
i
answered
with
a
sickly
grin
not
that
i
mind
about
lunch
i
could
have
eaten
if
i
had
the
time
you
have
as
much
belief
as
i
have
in
your
friend
remarked
jarvis
pasha
if
you
think
he
let
them
come
to
harm
they
all
in
the
same
box
apparently
i
excused
my
lack
of
faith
trust
fenton
said
the
head
of
the
police
he
was
sharp
enough
to
find
the
needles
in
the
haystack
and
he
smart
enough
and
strong
enough
to
take
care
of
them
when
they
found
on
this
jarvis
pasha
went
out
and
left
me
to
my
reflections
which
rushed
to
the
house
of
the
crocodile
every
one
who
has
read
or
heard
stories
of
native
cairo
knows
the
house
of
the
crocodile
in
the
street
of
the
sisters
and
how
in
the
later
days
of
mohammed
ali
people
scarcely
dared
to
name
it
aloud
the
tiger
defterdar
ahmed
built
it
for
that
beautiful
tigress
princess
zohra
favourite
daughter
of
mohammed
ali
who
married
her
off
to
the
fierce
soldier
when
she
became
too
troublesome
at
home
zohra
had
loved
a
young
irish
officer
who
was
murdered
for
her
sake
and
had
no
true
affection
to
give
ahmed
or
any
other
she
hated
all
men
because
of
the
murderer
her
own
nephew
and
vowed
that
since
her
love
had
cost
the
life
of
the
one
who
had
her
heart
others
who
dared
to
love
her
must
pay
the
same
price
when
ahmed
died
suddenly
soon
after
the
wedding
those
who
had
heard
of
zohra
vow
and
there
were
many
in
the
harems
whispered
poison
never
again
did
the
princess
drive
out
to
see
the
women
she
knew
and
those
who
had
been
her
friends
were
sent
away
from
the
door
of
the
dead
ahmed
palace
over
which
he
had
suspended
for
luck
a
huge
crocodile
killed
in
the
far
south
but
zohra
was
beautiful
with
strange
eyes
which
drew
love
whether
she
asked
for
it
or
not
and
sometimes
a
small
lattice
would
open
in
a
bay
of
one
of
those
windows
of
wooden
lace
whose
carving
was
known
as
mushrbiyeh
work
because
shirib
or
sherbet
used
to
be
placed
there
to
cool
out
of
the
lattice
would
look
a
wonderful
face
as
thinly
veiled
as
the
moon
by
a
mist
and
then
it
would
vanish
so
quickly
that
a
man
who
saw
half
believed
that
he
had
dreamed
but
the
eyes
of
the
dream
seemed
to
call
and
could
not
be
forgotten
any
more
than
the
song
of
a
siren
can
cease
to
echo
in
ears
which
once
have
heard
after
the
beginning
of
zohra
widowhood
the
noblest
and
handsomest
youths
of
cairo
began
mysteriously
to
disappear
they
would
be
well
and
happy
one
day
and
the
next
they
would
be
gone
from
the
places
that
knew
them
by
and
by
their
bodies
would
be
found
in
a
canal
always
the
same
canal
near
the
water
gate
of
the
house
of
the
crocodile
then
the
vow
of
the
princess
was
remembered
but
there
was
no
english
rule
in
those
days
and
the
police
shut
their
ears
and
eyes
where
a
daughter
of
mohammed
ali
was
concerned
mothers
and
sisters
of
handsome
young
men
shuddered
and
begged
those
they
loved
never
to
pass
through
the
dark
street
of
the
sisters
sharia
el
benât
where
the
crocodile
grinned
over
the
door
and
the
vision
of
a
face
looked
down
from
a
latticed
window
the
women
thought
of
the
water
gate
at
the
back
of
the
house
the
little
children
who
had
heard
secret
words
spoken
thought
of
the
crocodile
and
ran
crying
past
the
house
but
the
handsome
young
men
thought
only
of
the
face
and
each
one
said
to
himself
she
will
not
make
pay
the
price
still
as
years
went
on
bodies
were
seen
in
the
water
from
time
to
time
with
a
tiny
purple
spot
over
the
heart
to
show
the
curious
that
death
had
not
come
from
drowning
and
some
who
looked
for
lost
ones
could
not
reclaim
them
from
the
canal
for
bodies
were
not
always
found
as
time
passed
it
seemed
to
people
who
hurried
by
the
house
in
the
narrow
street
that
the
crocodile
grew
larger
and
larger
it
was
said
that
it
had
been
fed
on
the
children
of
men
tiger
ahmed
had
murdered
in
sennaar
none
dared
to
say
what
they
believed
of
princess
zohra
but
when
after
a
long
imprisonment
by
her
nephew
abbas
in
the
house
of
the
crocodile
she
escaped
to
constantinople
nobody
would
live
where
she
had
lived
and
the
palace
fell
almost
into
ruin
this
was
the
story
of
the
house
where
monny
gilder
and
rachel
guest
and
anthony
fenton
were
now
i
had
heard
it
talked
about
by
our
arab
servants
when
i
was
a
child
and
had
never
forgotten
though
scarcely
since
then
had
i
thought
of
the
tale
until
the
remembered
name
and
the
horrors
attached
to
it
jumped
into
my
mind
on
reading
anthony
letter
what
had
happened
in
the
house
of
the
crocodile
since
zohra
day
i
did
not
know
but
because
of
the
old
story
it
seemed
more
sinister
that
my
friends
should
appeal
for
help
from
that
place
than
from
any
other
in
cairo
i
was
not
left
long
alone
five
minutes
after
jarvis
pasha
went
out
of
the
room
to
arrange
things
according
to
fenton
request
he
sent
me
a
man
with
whiskey
and
soda
and
biscuits
i
drank
gladly
and
ate
rather
than
seem
ungrateful
but
there
was
a
lump
in
my
throat
which
would
stick
there
i
knew
until
those
three
were
away
from
the
house
of
the
crocodile
i
was
still
crumbling
biscuits
when
jarvis
pasha
came
briskly
back
well
he
asked
are
you
braced
up
now
if
you
like
to
be
in
this
business
you
can
i
sending
a
white
superintendent
with
my
police
to
raid
the
house
on
the
strength
of
fenton
letter
to
you
though
until
now
the
place
has
been
suspected
as
i
said
it
been
a
house
for
some
years
ground
floor
and
first
story
in
repair
just
as
in
zohra
day
upper
floors
ruinous
and
the
public
not
admitted
there
if
anything
queer
going
on
it
must
be
in
the
forbidden
part
and
the
caretaker
is
mixed
up
in
the
show
a
pity
you
felt
bound
to
let
fenton
messenger
off
you
can
go
with
my
superintendent
allen
and
reach
your
friends
as
soon
as
my
men
do
allen
has
instructions
to
let
fenton
and
the
ladies
if
they
found
there
slip
away
and
it
best
for
you
to
be
on
the
spot
to
save
mistakes
in
identification
also
ordered
a
closed
arabeah
to
wait
for
you
as
near
as
possible
my
men
will
show
you
where
you
know
it
for
certain
by
a
red
camellia
on
the
arab
driver
european
coat
and
by
the
way
take
this
browning
in
case
of
an
attack
which
i
do
anticipate
as
jarvis
pasha
spoke
he
opened
the
door
and
summoned
in
a
brown
young
britisher
wearing
the
tarboosh
which
denotes
gyppy
officialdom
evidently
allen
was
prepared
for
me
as
i
for
him
and
we
started
off
together
on
foot
for
it
seemed
that
our
destination
was
not
far
away
we
walked
swiftly
through
the
crowded
mousky
once
the
fashionable
part
of
cairo
before
the
tide
flowed
to
the
modern
quarter
and
after
a
few
intricate
turnings
plunged
into
a
still
twilight
region
the
streets
through
which
we
passed
were
so
narrow
and
the
old
houses
so
far
overhung
the
path
that
the
strip
of
sky
at
the
top
of
the
dark
canyon
was
a
mere
line
of
inlaid
blue
enamel
flecked
with
gold
the
splendid
mushrbiyeh
windows
thrust
out
toward
each
other
big
and
little
bays
across
the
ten
or
twelve
feet
of
distance
which
parted
them
as
if
to
whisper
secrets
yet
the
delicate
wooden
carvings
skilfully
hid
all
that
they
wished
to
hide
and
only
suggested
their
secrets
now
we
soon
be
coming
to
the
house
of
the
crocodile
said
allen
by
jove
it
a
joke
on
us
and
a
smart
one
if
it
been
turned
into
a
hasheesh
den
under
our
noses
but
it
must
be
something
new
or
we
should
have
got
onto
it
the
chief
thinks
already
he
can
guess
who
at
the
bottom
of
the
business
and
who
has
put
the
money
up
a
certain
bey
in
whose
service
the
caretaker
was
a
rich
old
johnny
very
old
fashioned
who
lives
not
far
off
in
a
beautiful
house
of
the
best
cairene
period
he
keen
on
antiquities
and
has
been
of
service
to
the
government
in
several
ways
though
he
a
reformed
smuggler
and
his
only
son
dead
now
was
a
hopeless
hashash
that
what
they
call
slaves
of
the
hasheesh
habit
i
suppose
you
read
all
about
the
of
the
crusaders
days
whom
we
speak
of
as
assassins
well
ever
since
then
the
hashasheyn
have
had
a
bad
reputation
but
this
old
man
i
speak
of
has
been
pitied
for
his
son
failings
which
he
pretends
to
think
a
for
his
own
past
repented
sins
now
lord
ernest
saunter
please
as
if
you
were
a
tourist
in
my
charge
admiring
the
old
doorways
two
native
workmen
appeared
in
front
of
us
with
pickaxes
on
their
shoulders
stopping
they
threw
down
their
tools
one
produced
a
cord
which
he
stretched
across
the
street
from
house
to
house
and
in
the
middle
he
hung
a
small
red
flag
then
the
pair
began
to
pick
in
a
leisurely
way
at
the
surface
of
the
road
and
before
we
reached
the
barrier
an
arab
policeman
stationed
himself
by
the
cord
glancing
ahead
i
saw
that
the
farther
end
of
the
narrow
lane
was
blocked
in
the
same
manner
this
is
one
trick
we
have
of
doing
our
work
quietly
said
allen
it
always
answers
pretty
well
i
said
nothing
but
used
my
eyes
coming
from
nowhere
apparently
there
were
twenty
men
in
the
street
a
few
had
crowbars
in
their
hands
others
native
policemen
carried
the
canes
with
which
they
control
the
movements
of
the
people
from
the
shaded
doorway
of
a
large
house
a
native
sergeant
of
police
stepped
out
as
we
approached
and
saluted
allen
over
the
closed
door
a
large
dryly
smiling
ancient
crocodile
hung
have
our
men
come
and
taken
their
places
asked
my
companion
in
arabic
yes
effendi
the
sergeant
answered
all
has
been
done
according
to
order
the
back
entrance
which
was
the
water
gate
before
the
old
canal
was
filled
up
is
surrounded
and
the
adjoining
houses
with
which
some
communication
may
have
been
established
are
watched
not
a
rat
could
have
crawled
out
since
we
came
nor
could
one
have
gone
in
is
the
feast
of
a
saint
and
these
people
have
their
excuse
not
to
open
the
house
to
visitors
for
so
it
is
with
other
show
places
look
it
is
written
up
that
until
there
is
no
admission
as
the
man
pointed
to
a
card
hanging
from
a
hook
he
and
allen
smiled
at
the
cleverness
of
this
pretext
for
closing
the
door
in
english
french
and
arabic
the
reason
was
announced
in
neat
print
probably
this
was
not
the
first
time
the
same
excuse
had
been
used
in
the
same
way
they
must
have
taken
alarm
at
something
and
thought
they
were
being
watched
allen
said
to
me
that
why
they
sported
their
oak
i
expect
we
shall
make
a
haul
as
for
everybody
sake
concerned
they
would
dare
let
their
clients
out
to
fall
into
a
trap
yes
why
or
else
he
stopped
and
i
did
not
ask
him
to
go
on
for
i
knew
that
to
ask
would
be
useless
yet
i
guessed
what
he
had
meant
to
say
and
why
he
had
stopped
he
did
wish
to
alarm
me
but
it
was
in
his
mind
that
the
house
had
teen
closed
because
of
something
planned
to
happen
inside
and
that
something
might
be
connected
with
my
friends
we
should
soon
know
my
first
thought
was
that
we
were
to
get
through
the
door
by
breaking
it
in
or
by
forcing
those
on
the
other
side
to
open
for
us
in
an
instant
however
i
realized
that
my
idea
was
absurd
it
would
take
an
hour
to
batter
down
that
thick
slab
of
old
cedarwood
and
allen
had
said
that
he
wanted
to
do
things
quietly
no
the
brown
sergeant
was
not
here
to
open
the
door
but
to
see
that
it
did
not
open
unless
for
our
benefit
two
of
allen
men
were
unfolding
a
curious
ladder
like
a
lattice
which
they
made
secure
with
screws
when
they
had
stretched
it
to
full
length
then
up
it
went
to
one
of
the
beautiful
mushrbiyeh
windows
which
on
the
level
of
the
story
above
the
ground
floor
bayed
graciously
overhanging
the
street
one
man
standing
below
held
the
ladder
firmly
in
place
while
another
small
and
lithe
as
a
monkey
and
enjoying
the
task
as
a
monkey
might
ran
up
to
the
top
that
leaned
against
the
window
evidently
he
was
a
skilled
worker
for
before
i
knew
what
he
would
be
at
he
had
with
some
small
sharp
instrument
prized
out
without
breaking
it
one
of
the
sections
of
carved
lattice
this
he
tossed
lightly
down
to
a
man
who
caught
it
and
as
he
and
four
others
after
him
slipped
through
the
opening
the
sergeant
knocked
on
the
closed
door
under
the
swinging
form
of
the
crocodile
nobody
answered
but
three
minutes
passed
and
then
suddenly
there
was
the
sound
of
a
falling
bar
and
a
very
old
very
dark
man
with
a
white
turban
and
a
white
beard
peeped
out
thieves
he
cried
in
arabic
thieves
break
in
at
the
windows
he
was
making
the
best
of
a
bad
business
i
guessed
and
hoped
somehow
to
justify
himself
to
the
police
but
though
he
was
gray
with
fright
he
forgot
to
look
surprised
my
arabic
was
not
equal
to
the
strain
of
catching
all
the
gabble
that
followed
the
old
man
protesting
that
it
was
right
to
close
the
house
that
if
it
were
the
police
and
not
thieves
who
broke
in
it
was
unjust
it
was
cruel
and
his
son
mansoor
the
caretaker
would
appeal
to
all
the
powers
before
he
had
come
to
the
end
of
his
first
breath
he
was
hushed
and
handcuffed
and
hustled
away
and
another
man
sprang
forward
from
behind
the
angle
of
a
inside
the
entrance
he
was
young
and
looked
strong
and
fierce
as
an
angry
giant
but
at
sight
of
allen
and
the
rest
of
us
he
stopped
as
if
we
had
shot
him
perhaps
he
had
not
expected
so
many
in
any
case
he
saw
that
there
was
nothing
he
could
hope
to
gain
by
violence
or
bluster
all
he
could
do
was
to
protest
as
his
father
had
done
that
this
visit
was
a
violation
of
his
right
to
close
the
house
on
a
holiday
do
be
a
fool
mansoor
said
allen
who
evidently
knew
him
you
understand
very
well
that
is
why
we
are
here
you
jot
a
hasheesh
den
upstairs
above
the
public
show
rooms
a
nice
trick
you
thought
you
played
us
but
you
see
you
did
bring
it
off
by
this
time
we
were
inside
the
house
having
thrust
the
caretaker
in
again
and
passing
the
three
tortuous
screen
walls
of
the
entrance
into
a
courtyard
several
young
arabs
dressed
as
servants
stood
there
and
stricken
at
sight
of
their
giant
master
held
by
four
policemen
but
there
was
not
a
sign
of
our
men
who
had
crawled
through
the
window
and
i
was
impatient
to
go
where
they
had
gone
there
was
no
sound
of
scuffling
no
sound
at
all
except
the
crying
of
some
startled
doves
and
mansoor
voice
swearing
by
the
sacred
beard
that
if
anything
were
wrong
he
was
not
the
one
to
blame
there
were
those
above
him
who
must
be
obeyed
or
he
and
all
that
were
his
would
be
put
out
of
life
but
i
cared
too
little
for
him
or
what
might
become
of
him
and
his
to
listen
much
i
looked
up
and
saw
at
the
left
of
the
courtyard
with
its
several
closed
doors
a
short
flight
of
steps
with
a
and
a
doorway
leading
to
a
winding
staircase
round
the
court
went
a
gallery
supported
with
old
marble
pillars
and
underneath
on
one
side
was
a
large
recess
the
takhtabosh
raised
slightly
above
the
level
of
the
courtyard
and
having
a
row
of
wooden
benches
round
its
three
walls
here
the
caretaker
and
his
male
relatives
and
friends
had
evidently
been
smoking
their
nargilehs
and
drinking
coffee
our
arrival
had
disturbed
them
in
the
midst
suddenly
into
the
frightened
mourning
of
the
doves
broke
a
sharp
sound
of
cracking
wood
come
along
cried
allen
they
be
past
the
barrier
in
a
minute
and
leaving
mansoor
and
the
others
to
be
dealt
with
by
subordinates
he
led
the
way
up
the
steep
stairs
at
a
run
we
did
not
stop
at
the
first
story
the
show
part
of
the
house
of
the
crocodile
but
catching
a
glimpse
of
a
latticed
balcony
off
the
landing
all
lovely
mushrbiyeh
work
and
a
great
room
of
persian
tiled
walls
and
coloured
marble
floor
beyond
we
dashed
up
another
flight
of
stairs
to
the
story
above
these
stairs
were
of
common
wood
and
somewhat
out
of
repair
at
the
top
was
a
door
of
carved
cedarwood
like
those
below
but
rough
in
execution
faded
and
with
here
and
there
a
starpoint
or
triangle
of
the
pattern
missing
leaving
a
hole
in
the
thick
wood
on
this
door
was
nailed
a
large
card
with
the
notice
in
english
french
and
arabic
forbidden
to
the
public
what
a
grand
idea
to
install
a
hasheesh
den
here
i
could
not
help
thinking
as
i
followed
at
allen
heels
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
where
two
of
his
men
worked
with
crowbars
to
prize
open
that
theatrically
dilapidated
door
behind
the
pair
who
worked
were
the
others
who
had
entered
by
the
window
below
and
hardly
had
we
taken
our
places
in
the
strange
when
with
a
loud
groan
the
door
gave
way
the
couple
in
front
almost
fell
into
a
dark
passage
on
the
other
side
and
my
heart
leaped
for
i
half
expected
to
see
them
driven
back
upon
us
by
an
attack
with
knives
or
pistols
but
the
dim
vista
seemed
to
hold
only
silence
and
emptiness
as
i
peered
over
men
shoulders
and
as
we
crowded
in
allen
pushing
ahead
to
take
the
lead
nothing
stirred
the
passage
was
but
a
gallery
like
that
below
but
instead
of
being
open
it
was
closed
in
with
lattice
of
mushrbiyeh
work
so
that
though
those
within
could
look
through
it
was
as
secret
for
those
outside
as
if
it
had
been
enclosed
by
a
solid
wall
the
darkness
was
patterned
with
light
like
ebony
thinly
inlaid
with
gold
for
the
afternoon
sunlight
trickled
into
the
delicate
loopholes
of
the
carvings
and
we
began
to
see
what
enterprise
had
made
of
this
ruinous
upper
story
the
floor
had
been
dilapidated
and
unsafe
but
new
boards
had
been
placed
over
it
covered
with
matting
and
rugs
to
deaden
sound
and
give
an
appearance
of
comfort
we
walked
quickly
along
to
the
end
where
this
closed
gallery
turned
at
right
angles
and
there
found
another
door
new
and
rough
evidently
but
lately
put
up
it
was
not
so
strong
as
the
old
one
and
it
yielded
in
a
few
minutes
to
the
furious
industry
of
our
men
with
their
crowbars
they
lifted
the
door
from
its
broken
hinges
leaning
it
against
a
wall
and
as
we
passed
through
an
arab
pulled
aside
a
thick
curtain
which
filled
in
a
doorway
he
was
evidently
a
servant
and
seeing
the
police
showed
no
sign
of
surprise
but
only
of
a
most
humble
resignation
which
disclaimed
responsibility
and
begged
for
mercy
in
silence
the
man
was
taken
into
custody
and
allen
and
i
with
three
of
the
four
policemen
passed
into
the
region
behind
the
portière
there
all
was
dusk
save
for
the
faint
light
sifting
down
from
a
carved
wooden
dome
in
the
ceiling
partly
curtained
and
a
dark
lantern
flashed
out
a
long
revealing
ray
the
men
ran
to
pull
back
heavy
cloth
hangings
which
entirely
covered
the
latticed
windows
and
would
allow
lamps
to
be
lit
at
night
without
being
seen
from
street
or
courtyard
instantly
sunshine
pierced
the
carved
interstices
and
let
us
see
what
enterprise
had
done
for
his
clients
we
were
in
the
antechamber
of
a
long
beautiful
room
the
old
coloured
marble
of
the
durkááh
the
lower
level
of
floor
nearest
the
entrance
had
been
repaired
with
new
the
dilapidations
of
a
fountain
were
almost
hidden
by
pink
azaleas
in
pots
the
liwán
on
the
next
level
had
a
good
rug
or
two
and
the
diwáán
at
the
farthest
and
highest
end
was
furnished
with
mattresses
and
pillows
the
low
of
marble
were
set
here
and
there
with
glass
bowls
of
roses
and
syringa
and
tiny
cedarwood
cupboards
high
in
the
tiled
walls
were
open
to
show
coffee
cups
tobacco
jars
and
pipes
made
of
cocoanut
shells
with
long
stems
of
cane
four
men
who
had
apparently
been
lying
on
the
mattresses
stood
up
and
faced
us
not
fiercely
but
with
something
of
the
resignation
two
were
in
european
clothes
with
the
inevitable
tarboosh
and
two
equally
well
dressed
were
old
fashioned
and
picturesque
in
the
long
silk
gown
and
turban
style
which
antoun
and
other
lovers
of
the
ancient
ways
affected
they
were
of
the
effendi
class
and
might
be
merchants
or
professional
persons
a
turbaned
man
with
a
black
beard
allen
knew
and
greeted
in
arabic
hussein
effendi
who
would
have
thought
to
see
you
here
why
not
answered
the
other
with
a
melancholy
smile
and
shrug
of
the
shoulders
there
is
no
harm
really
but
only
in
the
eyes
of
the
english
we
are
caught
and
we
can
not
complain
for
we
have
had
true
delight
and
we
have
known
since
the
alarm
came
last
night
that
we
might
have
to
pay
for
our
pleasure
so
you
had
the
alarm
last
night
said
allen
looking
as
if
there
were
nothing
surprising
or
puzzling
in
that
yes
why
should
we
not
admit
it
now
word
came
that
a
watch
had
been
set
outside
both
back
and
front
and
none
of
us
dared
leave
the
house
we
consented
to
be
locked
in
though
there
is
one
in
another
room
who
wished
to
get
out
and
run
the
risk
that
was
not
permitted
for
the
sake
of
others
and
to
prevent
him
from
taking
his
own
way
in
spite
of
prudence
we
let
ourselves
be
shut
in
with
only
one
attendant
who
took
through
the
holes
in
the
door
such
little
food
as
we
needed
we
had
begun
to
hope
that
it
had
been
a
false
alarm
or
since
no
inquiries
seemed
to
have
been
made
below
that
the
watchers
had
gone
and
would
not
come
again
we
planned
as
soon
as
night
fell
to
go
to
our
homes
but
it
was
not
to
be
and
if
any
are
to
blame
it
is
not
those
who
come
to
take
pleasures
provided
for
them
but
rather
they
who
cheat
the
coastguard
of
the
camels
and
bring
what
is
forbidden
into
egypt
the
blame
will
be
rightfully
apportioned
said
allen
meanwhile
i
am
sorry
to
say
hussein
effendi
that
you
and
those
in
your
company
are
subject
to
the
law
i
must
now
leave
you
and
go
farther
to
see
what
others
we
have
to
deal
with
the
four
effendis
were
politely
left
in
charge
of
two
policemen
who
would
have
been
equal
to
twice
their
number
and
our
one
remaining
man
went
on
with
allen
and
me
your
friends
and
perhaps
two
or
three
who
can
afford
to
pay
big
prices
will
have
had
their
smoke
in
private
rooms
allen
explained
we
can
guess
it
was
who
wanted
to
break
out
there
are
probably
no
more
doors
only
curtains
so
we
shall
have
no
trouble
but
forget
that
if
anything
unexpected
should
happen
you
have
a
pistol
of
course
you
understand
that
it
could
be
used
only
in
an
extreme
case
a
curtained
doorway
led
out
from
the
diwáán
into
a
small
anteroom
and
there
on
the
floor
sat
bedr
el
gemály
the
picture
of
dejection
had
i
raised
my
voice
in
the
next
room
he
would
perhaps
have
ventured
in
to
see
what
i
could
do
to
help
him
for
now
at
sight
of
me
he
scrambled
up
in
shamefaced
eagerness
oh
my
lordship
he
began
to
cackle
praise
be
to
allah
you
are
come
i
was
persuaded
to
bring
the
young
ladies
here
they
would
make
me
do
it
yes
sir
it
is
not
my
fault
they
pay
me
i
have
to
obey
then
we
get
caught
like
we
was
some
rats
no
fair
to
punish
me
the
ladies
all
right
no
harm
come
except
a
little
sick
if
no
harm
has
come
that
not
due
to
you
but
to
a
very
different
man
as
you
well
know
i
said
and
as
i
spoke
the
man
i
had
in
my
mind
appeared
before
my
eyes
hullo
i
exclaimed
joyously
anthony
eyes
and
allen
met
but
i
could
not
tell
if
they
knew
each
other
nor
could
i
ask
then
it
was
enough
for
allen
in
any
case
however
that
this
magnificent
hadji
was
one
of
the
friends
for
whom
i
searched
he
turned
to
bedr
you
brought
two
ladies
here
i
understand
he
said
quickly
and
sharply
then
you
must
have
acquaintance
with
the
place
for
good
reasons
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
you
i
shall
not
arrest
you
but
you
will
have
to
report
at
the
governorat
inside
the
hour
or
you
will
regret
it
do
you
know
the
way
out
at
the
back
of
the
house
i
do
gracious
one
bedr
responded
with
businesslike
promptness
then
take
these
gentlemen
and
the
ladies
whom
i
do
not
need
to
see
out
by
that
door
and
you
will
all
be
allowed
to
go
because
my
men
who
are
there
have
seen
lord
ernest
borrow
and
they
have
my
instructions
we
waited
for
no
more
but
followed
anthony
who
made
a
dash
through
the
further
room
and
into
another
there
on
a
mattress
crouched
two
forlorn
figures
veiled
as
if
in
haste
and
muffled
in
black
satin
such
as
turkish
ladies
wear
in
the
street
lord
ernest
oh
how
glad
i
am
cried
one
of
these
creatures
while
the
other
less
vital
or
more
miserable
whimpered
and
gurgled
a
little
behind
her
veil
come
along
quick
i
said
and
they
came
bedr
led
the
way
thankful
to
show
himself
of
use
anthony
followed
as
if
to
protect
or
screen
the
girls
from
sight
i
brought
up
the
rear
and
so
scuttling
through
a
rabbit
warren
of
little
unfurnished
dilapidated
rooms
we
found
a
narrow
side
staircase
and
tumbled
down
it
anyhow
in
dust
and
dimness
then
two
more
staircases
and
we
were
in
a
cellar
which
looked
as
if
it
might
once
have
been
used
as
a
prison
up
again
and
rattling
at
a
chained
door
then
out
into
light
and
air
into
the
midst
of
a
group
which
for
an
instant
closed
threateningly
round
us
but
the
sergeant
i
had
seen
was
among
the
alert
brown
men
a
glance
a
gesture
and
we
were
allowed
to
pass
a
youth
running
with
us
to
show
the
promised
carriage
and
the
arab
driver
with
the
red
camellia
so
it
was
over
this
adventure
yet
was
it
over
that
remained
to
be
seen
and
remained
also
to
see
what
it
meant
if
indeed
there
were
a
meaning
underneath
the
surface
chapter
xii
the
night
of
the
full
moon
it
seems
too
good
to
be
true
that
it
should
end
like
this
said
monny
she
said
it
on
the
roof
of
mena
house
in
the
made
of
mushrbiyeh
work
which
i
had
engaged
for
a
little
private
that
night
you
see
it
was
the
night
of
the
full
moon
the
magic
night
of
the
which
must
not
be
wasted
no
matter
how
tired
you
may
be
or
how
many
excitements
you
may
have
lived
through
anthony
and
i
had
had
our
explanations
he
had
told
me
that
one
night
in
a
café
where
he
was
spreading
the
news
of
his
dream
he
had
heard
two
men
talking
in
low
voices
about
the
house
of
the
crocodile
the
word
hasheesh
had
not
been
mentioned
but
anthony
had
imbibed
a
vague
impression
of
something
secret
and
had
wondered
and
been
interested
then
the
matter
had
slipped
his
mind
but
summoned
in
the
night
from
the
writing
of
letters
to
advise
jones
he
had
recalled
wish
to
visit
a
hasheesh
den
he
knew
of
none
but
suspected
the
existence
of
one
or
two
how
to
find
out
in
a
hurry
he
had
asked
himself
and
with
that
the
remembrance
of
those
few
whispered
words
in
the
café
had
come
echoing
back
to
his
brain
he
acted
upon
the
suggestion
went
to
the
door
of
the
swinging
crocodile
knocked
and
knocked
again
had
the
door
opened
to
him
as
if
in
surprise
by
an
apparently
sleepy
man
announced
the
motive
of
his
coming
as
if
it
were
a
foregone
conclusion
that
hasheesh
could
be
smoked
in
that
house
by
the
initiated
his
disguise
was
not
suspected
it
never
was
when
he
played
the
egyptian
and
when
asked
who
had
sent
him
he
had
the
inspiration
to
utter
the
name
of
that
bey
who
had
been
master
this
gave
him
entrance
he
was
taken
upstairs
passed
through
the
door
forbidden
to
the
public
and
the
first
person
he
saw
in
the
long
room
as
he
entered
was
bedr
smoking
a
gozeh
one
of
those
cocoanut
pipes
in
which
hasheesh
is
mingled
with
the
persian
tobacco
called
tumbák
bedr
was
accused
of
treachery
and
defended
himself
the
ladies
had
insisted
it
was
his
place
to
obey
he
had
done
no
wrong
in
engaging
a
carriage
to
wait
outside
the
ghezireh
palace
gardens
and
bringing
his
employers
to
the
best
place
in
cairo
for
the
hasheesh
smoking
the
ladies
were
safe
and
happy
in
a
private
room
where
they
had
tried
their
little
experiment
and
now
they
were
sleeping
as
soon
as
they
waked
and
felt
like
going
home
he
was
ready
to
take
them
it
was
for
miss
gilder
not
for
bedr
to
beg
pardon
of
her
friends
if
they
were
frightened
and
all
the
time
it
had
seemed
to
anthony
that
the
man
was
expecting
some
one
to
arrive
he
watched
the
doorway
half
eagerly
half
anxiously
when
a
servant
came
or
went
he
started
and
betrayed
emotion
which
might
have
been
disappointment
or
relief
but
when
anthony
questioned
him
he
said
i
expect
no
one
effendi
it
is
only
that
i
shall
not
be
easy
till
we
get
the
ladies
home
now
you
tell
me
their
people
are
alarmed
just
then
and
before
anthony
saw
the
girls
a
servant
had
come
running
in
to
say
that
there
was
an
alarm
something
had
happened
in
the
street
and
the
police
were
there
mansoor
feared
that
it
was
a
ruse
and
that
the
house
was
being
watched
back
and
front
where
the
forbidden
thing
is
no
precaution
can
be
too
great
for
their
own
sakes
and
mansoor
sake
no
one
must
go
out
perhaps
not
till
the
next
night
but
luckily
a
saint
day
would
give
peace
for
the
morrow
and
all
doors
could
be
shut
without
causing
remark
the
news
that
there
was
no
escape
for
many
hours
to
come
distressed
no
one
apparently
except
antoun
he
had
gone
to
the
door
and
tried
to
open
it
but
found
that
already
it
was
locked
on
the
other
side
then
he
knew
that
it
was
useless
to
struggle
for
he
was
unarmed
the
door
was
thick
and
no
one
outside
could
hear
if
he
shouted
he
must
use
his
wits
but
first
he
must
make
sure
that
the
two
girls
were
safe
he
forced
rather
than
induced
bedr
to
show
him
the
room
they
had
engaged
a
small
one
closed
only
with
a
portière
and
looking
over
the
court
down
into
the
recess
where
mansoor
went
on
like
a
watch
dog
in
his
kennel
it
was
true
as
bedr
had
said
the
girls
slept
on
a
cushioned
mattress
wrapped
in
black
habberahs
their
faces
turned
to
the
wall
as
they
could
not
be
taken
out
anthony
did
not
wake
them
but
let
them
get
in
peace
their
money
worth
of
dreaming
his
next
thought
was
to
try
and
bribe
the
arab
attendant
to
smuggle
out
a
letter
but
acceptable
as
a
bribe
would
have
been
the
man
explained
his
helplessness
to
earn
it
at
least
for
the
time
being
he
could
do
nothing
till
one
of
his
came
up
from
below
to
pass
the
food
for
the
imprisoned
smokers
through
a
hole
in
the
door
made
purposely
in
case
of
just
such
an
emergency
probably
no
one
would
appear
till
morning
for
who
would
be
hungry
before
then
even
with
the
morning
it
might
be
mansoor
himself
who
would
bring
the
food
and
inquire
again
at
the
door
if
all
were
well
within
but
if
the
noble
hadji
wrote
the
letter
it
should
be
sent
when
opportunity
arose
one
of
the
servants
below
stairs
said
the
man
was
his
father
who
might
during
the
next
day
be
able
to
slip
out
as
if
on
some
errand
then
he
would
perhaps
take
a
letter
if
he
could
be
sure
of
good
pay
and
that
he
would
not
be
delivered
up
to
the
police
so
anthony
had
written
on
a
sheet
torn
from
his
notebook
and
made
an
envelope
of
another
sheet
the
address
of
the
ghezireh
palace
had
helped
the
man
to
believe
that
no
evil
would
reach
his
father
and
a
sweetener
in
the
shape
of
all
anthony
ready
money
had
done
the
rest
but
evidently
the
old
man
had
not
succeeded
in
finding
an
excuse
for
an
errand
until
after
the
noon
hour
and
meanwhile
time
had
seemed
long
in
the
house
of
the
crocodile
when
the
girls
waked
wanting
to
go
home
they
were
ill
they
found
the
game
not
worth
the
candle
but
anthony
presence
had
given
them
comfort
they
were
humble
and
remorseful
and
bedr
was
so
conspicuously
a
worm
that
monny
consented
to
his
discharge
it
would
take
more
time
than
we
got
to
make
him
worth
converting
she
said
to
rachel
when
the
armenian
had
carefully
laid
all
the
blame
of
the
expedition
upon
her
shoulders
never
were
two
runaway
children
more
glad
to
be
found
and
restored
to
their
anxious
relatives
than
monny
gilder
and
rachel
guest
as
for
bedr
he
took
his
dismissal
with
a
week
wages
submissively
but
the
gravest
question
concerning
him
still
lacked
an
answer
had
he
merely
been
officious
and
indiscreet
in
guiding
the
girls
secretly
to
the
house
of
the
crocodile
and
there
procuring
hasheesh
to
buy
them
dreams
or
had
he
wanted
something
to
happen
in
that
house
which
had
not
happened
a
certain
amount
of
browbeating
from
antoun
and
bullying
from
me
dragged
nothing
out
of
him
and
perhaps
there
was
nothing
to
be
dragged
perhaps
it
was
through
oversensitiveness
that
brigit
and
i
dwelt
suspiciously
upon
bedr
motives
and
asked
each
other
who
it
was
he
had
expected
at
the
house
of
the
crocodile
even
anthony
did
not
accuse
the
armenian
of
anything
worse
than
slyness
and
cowardice
according
to
him
the
two
worst
vices
of
a
man
but
he
volunteered
to
find
out
what
mysterious
in
the
street
had
caused
the
sudden
closing
of
the
doors
it
was
biddy
thought
that
the
person
bedr
wished
to
meet
might
fortunately
have
been
prevented
by
this
very
disturbance
from
keeping
his
appointment
and
monny
saved
a
serious
ending
to
her
adventure
it
began
to
seem
rather
a
worry
travelling
with
so
important
a
young
woman
as
miss
gilder
and
a
vague
dread
of
the
future
hung
over
me
as
it
hung
over
brigit
who
loved
the
girl
we
felt
dimly
as
if
we
had
had
a
warning
and
did
not
yet
know
how
to
profit
by
it
the
atmosphere
was
charged
with
electricity
as
before
an
earthquake
and
we
felt
that
the
affair
of
the
hasheesh
den
might
be
but
a
preface
to
some
chapter
yet
unwritten
still
it
was
impossible
not
to
forgive
monny
her
indiscretion
indeed
she
became
so
and
childlike
in
her
desire
to
make
up
for
what
we
had
suffered
that
the
difficulty
was
not
to
like
her
better
she
besought
us
to
forget
the
episode
if
we
only
how
sick
she
and
rachel
had
been
we
see
why
they
never
wanted
to
think
of
those
hours
again
and
when
i
chanced
to
mention
that
would
be
full
moon
the
night
of
nights
when
the
sphinx
and
the
ghizeh
pyramids
held
their
court
monny
begged
to
have
the
bad
taste
of
her
naughtiness
taken
out
of
her
mouth
by
a
dinner
at
mena
house
we
might
dine
early
and
plunge
into
the
desert
later
when
the
moon
was
high
of
course
i
proposed
that
all
should
be
my
guests
all
except
antoun
who
though
recognized
as
a
gentleman
of
egypt
was
considered
by
miss
gilder
an
alien
not
exactly
on
dining
terms
he
was
supposed
to
go
home
to
his
own
address
at
he
was
to
take
a
taxi
to
mena
house
where
he
would
arrive
before
nine
in
time
to
help
me
organize
my
expedition
i
explained
to
monny
that
though
we
should
dine
privately
it
would
be
my
duty
to
see
that
the
people
paid
their
respects
to
the
sphinx
and
gazed
upon
her
as
she
ate
if
they
missed
this
sight
or
if
anything
went
wrong
with
their
way
of
seeing
it
i
should
never
be
forgiven
but
the
much
chastened
monny
graciously
did
not
mind
she
thought
it
would
be
fun
to
watch
the
rounding
up
his
flock
useless
to
explain
to
her
the
subtle
social
distinction
between
a
flock
and
a
set
both
with
capitals
to
her
the
blaze
of
the
set
smartness
was
but
the
flicker
of
a
penny
dip
we
could
drive
the
crowd
on
ahead
and
look
at
moon
when
they
were
out
of
its
light
so
there
the
explanation
of
monny
presence
in
the
mushrbiyeh
kiosk
on
the
roof
of
mena
house
on
the
night
following
the
great
adventure
which
would
have
put
most
girls
to
bed
with
nervous
prostration
part
of
our
programme
to
be
sure
had
failed
but
it
was
not
a
part
which
could
interfere
with
my
selfish
enjoyment
east
had
changed
her
mind
at
the
last
moment
and
had
decided
not
to
dine
although
i
had
invited
sir
marcus
on
purpose
for
her
according
to
biddy
cleopatra
had
something
up
her
sleeve
something
her
excuse
of
seediness
was
meant
to
cover
maybe
it
was
only
a
flirtatious
wish
to
disappoint
sir
marcus
maybe
it
was
something
more
subtle
but
it
did
not
matter
much
to
anybody
except
lark
who
was
obliged
to
put
up
with
jones
in
place
of
east
for
rachel
guest
and
the
sculptor
whom
we
nicknamed
bill
bailey
were
to
be
paired
off
and
urged
by
biddy
i
intended
to
monopolize
monny
i
suppose
there
could
scarcely
be
a
more
ideal
room
for
an
intimate
on
a
moonlight
night
than
that
kiosk
on
the
flat
roof
of
mena
house
through
the
wide
open
doors
and
the
openwork
walls
like
a
canopy
of
black
lace
lined
with
silver
the
moonlight
filtered
sketching
exquisite
designs
upon
the
white
floor
and
bringing
out
jewelled
flecks
of
colour
on
the
covering
and
cushions
of
the
divans
there
was
no
electricity
in
this
kiosk
and
we
aided
the
moonlight
only
with
candles
and
ruby
domed
fairy
lamps
the
exact
shade
of
the
crimson
ramblers
which
decorated
the
table
for
the
corners
by
the
open
doors
i
had
ordered
pots
of
madonna
lilies
which
gave
up
their
perfume
to
the
moon
and
looked
in
the
mingling
radiance
of
rose
and
silver
like
hovering
doves
oh
i
could
hug
and
that
moon
sighed
monny
tall
and
fair
in
her
white
dress
as
the
lilies
i
had
chosen
for
her
i
was
relieved
that
the
man
in
the
moon
has
now
been
superseded
by
a
gibson
girl
for
monny
was
beautiful
at
that
moment
as
a
vision
met
in
the
secret
garden
which
lies
on
the
other
side
of
sleep
and
the
stars
monny
said
as
i
watched
her
uplifted
face
wondering
just
how
much
i
was
in
love
with
it
the
little
stars
high
up
at
the
zenith
twinkle
like
silver
bees
those
that
sit
on
the
edge
of
the
horizon
are
huge
and
golden
like
desert
oh
do
you
know
lord
ernest
if
quite
a
dull
uninteresting
man
or
or
one
that
it
would
be
madness
even
to
of
proposed
to
me
on
such
a
night
i
should
to
say
yes
it
would
seem
so
prosaic
and
such
a
waste
of
moonlight
not
to
would
you
feel
like
that
if
you
were
a
girl
i
sure
i
should
i
replied
with
extraordinary
sympathy
i
feel
like
it
even
as
a
man
i
warn
you
not
to
propose
or
i
shall
snap
at
you
she
laughed
but
i
was
wondering
if
i
were
dull
and
uninteresting
enough
to
stand
a
chance
it
seemed
as
if
providence
were
actually
it
to
me
but
just
then
biddy
and
sir
marcus
came
to
the
doorway
which
so
becomingly
framed
monny
form
and
mine
naturally
that
put
the
idea
out
of
my
head
and
two
such
opportunities
do
come
to
a
man
in
a
single
night
dinner
was
not
ready
yet
and
we
sauntered
about
on
the
flat
roof
white
as
marble
in
the
moonlight
the
sky
was
milk
the
desert
honey
far
off
cairo
with
its
crowned
citadel
pale
opal
veined
with
light
and
faintly
streaked
with
misty
greens
and
purples
the
cultivated
land
a
deep
indigo
sea
the
fantastically
built
hotel
in
its
ancient
beginnings
the
palace
of
a
pasha
was
like
a
closely
huddled
group
of
châlets
looked
down
on
from
its
central
roof
on
the
fringe
of
the
the
cafés
and
buzzed
with
life
and
glittered
like
lighted
beehives
outside
the
gateway
and
and
drivers
of
sandcarts
chattered
and
on
a
few
moonlight
nights
to
come
they
would
reap
their
monthly
harvest
they
were
all
ready
to
start
off
anywhere
at
a
moment
notice
but
apart
from
them
and
their
clamour
reposed
a
row
of
camels
previously
engaged
free
therefore
to
enjoy
themselves
until
after
dinner
as
we
gazed
down
as
if
from
a
captive
balloon
at
the
line
of
sitting
forms
they
looked
immense
like
giant
newborn
birds
with
their
huge
bodies
and
thin
necks
along
the
arboured
road
from
cairo
flashed
after
their
lights
winking
in
and
out
between
the
dark
trees
now
blazing
now
invisible
their
occupants
all
intent
on
doing
the
right
thing
dining
at
mena
house
and
seeing
the
full
moon
feed
honey
to
the
sphinx
some
wishing
to
save
time
or
to
dine
later
in
town
or
to
take
a
train
for
somewhere
later
did
not
turn
in
at
the
hotel
gate
but
swept
past
with
siren
shrieks
and
tore
on
hoping
to
rush
the
steep
hill
to
the
pyramid
platform
at
top
speed
only
a
few
of
the
strongest
succeeded
and
with
a
dash
instead
of
an
ignominious
crawl
triumphantly
fanned
their
lights
along
the
base
of
that
vast
monument
in
which
king
cheops
vainly
sought
eternal
privacy
what
would
he
say
we
wondered
could
he
see
the
crowds
of
tourists
tearing
out
to
pay
him
a
call
on
their
way
to
the
sphinx
would
he
blight
them
with
a
curse
or
would
he
remember
pearly
nights
of
old
when
his
subjects
assembled
in
multitudes
for
the
feast
of
the
goddess
neith
when
the
moon
was
full
and
all
the
white
brightly
painted
houses
along
the
nile
reflected
their
flowerlike
illuminations
in
the
water
anyhow
as
sir
john
biddell
would
have
said
this
was
helping
to
keep
his
name
before
the
public
and
nothing
could
succeed
in
vulgarizing
his
mountain
of
gold
in
its
gleaming
waves
of
desert
under
pulsing
stars
and
creamy
floods
of
moonlight
anthony
had
told
me
that
the
great
tip
was
to
go
out
while
the
less
instructed
sightseers
ate
their
dinner
then
the
desert
was
comparatively
empty
and
more
important
still
instead
of
having
the
moon
on
her
head
and
her
face
in
shadow
the
sphinx
received
its
full
blaze
in
her
farseeing
eyes
of
this
advice
i
meant
to
avail
myself
feeling
vaguely
guilty
as
i
thought
of
the
giver
who
was
absent
from
the
feast
anthony
fenton
one
of
the
finest
young
soldiers
in
egypt
who
could
be
lionized
in
at
home
if
he
would
stand
for
it
anthony
who
would
he
but
accept
the
repentant
overtures
of
that
tyrannical
old
prince
his
maternal
grandfather
might
inherit
a
fortune
and
a
palace
at
constantinople
yet
as
ahmed
antoun
in
his
green
turban
he
was
taboo
at
our
little
party
he
was
due
later
however
and
i
rather
expected
to
find
him
waiting
below
when
i
excused
myself
to
descend
to
the
set
but
i
had
not
left
the
roof
when
a
note
for
monny
was
brought
up
by
an
ebony
person
in
livery
i
watched
her
as
she
read
one
side
of
her
face
turned
to
marble
by
the
moon
the
other
stained
rose
by
the
candles
i
thought
that
the
rosy
side
grew
more
rosy
as
she
finished
the
letter
there
a
message
for
you
lord
ernest
she
said
aunt
clara
wants
me
to
tell
you
that
ca
meet
you
at
the
hotel
because
she
changed
her
mind
about
not
coming
out
and
sent
for
him
she
felt
better
it
seems
and
got
thinking
what
a
pity
it
would
be
to
miss
the
full
moon
so
she
suddenly
remembered
that
was
with
us
and
decided
to
invite
him
she
writes
in
a
hurry
and
did
know
where
they
would
dine
but
says
anyhow
they
meet
us
by
the
sphinx
between
nine
and
ten
where
dine
echoed
sir
marcus
pricked
to
interest
was
she
going
to
let
fe
i
mean
take
her
out
to
dinner
apparently
she
was
replied
monny
rather
dryly
why
not
asked
brigit
he
perfectly
splendid
and
east
not
that
she
is
a
young
woman
of
course
is
old
enough
to
go
about
without
a
chaperon
if
we
to
meet
them
between
nine
and
ten
at
the
sphinx
said
monny
briskly
do
you
think
lord
ernest
you
better
hurry
and
get
your
people
off
so
we
can
set
out
ourselves
i
going
i
assured
her
but
i
thought
we
planned
to
give
them
a
long
start
in
hopes
that
they
might
be
ready
to
come
back
by
the
time
we
arrived
oh
well
she
said
that
will
make
it
very
late
wo
it
and
we
may
miss
aunt
clara
anyhow
lots
of
other
creatures
just
as
bad
as
yours
will
be
there
for
we
ca
engage
the
desert
like
a
private
that
settled
it
i
dashed
downstairs
and
sorted
out
my
charges
they
had
got
themselves
up
in
all
kinds
of
costumes
for
this
act
one
man
had
on
a
folding
which
he
had
thought
just
the
right
thing
for
egypt
as
it
was
so
easy
to
pack
girls
in
evening
dress
men
young
and
old
in
helmets
and
straw
hats
ancient
maidens
and
fat
married
ladies
in
dust
cloaks
or
ball
gowns
climbed
or
leaped
or
scrambled
onto
camels
with
shrieks
of
joy
or
moans
of
horror
or
else
they
tumbled
onto
donkeys
which
bounded
away
before
the
riders
were
well
on
their
backs
and
men
women
and
animals
were
shouting
giggling
groaning
gabbling
snarling
and
squeaking
an
extraordinary
procession
to
pay
honour
to
the
pyramids
and
the
lonely
sphinx
we
of
the
considered
ourselves
figuratively
speaking
above
camels
far
above
donkeys
and
scornful
of
in
which
it
was
irreverent
to
charge
up
to
the
great
pyramid
as
if
to
the
door
of
a
café
we
walked
and
monny
still
lent
herself
to
me
but
she
no
longer
bubbled
over
with
delight
at
everything
a
subdued
mood
was
upon
her
and
her
eyes
looked
sad
even
anxious
in
the
translucent
light
which
was
not
so
much
like
earthly
moonlight
as
the
beginning
of
sunrise
in
some
far
magic
dreamland
she
had
the
pathetic
air
of
a
spoiled
child
who
begins
suddenly
if
only
vaguely
to
realize
that
it
can
not
have
everything
it
wants
in
the
world
and
she
merely
smiled
when
i
told
her
how
to
insure
the
peace
of
the
desert
i
had
offered
a
prize
of
a
large
blue
scarab
as
big
as
a
paperweight
for
that
member
of
the
set
who
did
not
even
say
oh
to
the
sphinx
antoun
had
vetted
the
alleged
scarab
and
pronounced
it
a
modern
forgery
but
nobody
else
knew
that
and
as
a
prize
it
was
popular
the
sky
had
that
clear
pale
blue
of
dawn
when
day
first
realizes
that
though
born
of
night
it
is
no
longer
night
casseopeia
chair
and
orion
were
being
tossed
about
the
burning
heavens
like
golden
furniture
out
of
a
house
on
fire
and
one
great
had
fallen
on
the
apex
of
cruel
khufu
pyramid
i
should
have
liked
to
believe
it
was
sirius
the
lucky
star
sacred
to
isis
and
hathor
but
monny
schoolgirl
knowledge
of
astronomy
bereft
me
of
that
innocent
pleasure
no
wonder
that
the
ancient
egyptians
with
such
jewels
in
their
blue
were
famous
astrologers
and
astronomers
before
the
days
when
rameses
daughter
found
moses
in
the
bulrushes
of
roda
island
the
stars
spoke
to
us
as
we
walked
through
the
sand
and
the
pure
wind
of
the
desert
spoke
other
words
of
the
same
language
the
language
of
the
universe
and
of
nature
here
and
there
yellow
lights
in
a
distant
camp
flashed
out
like
fireflies
far
away
across
the
billowing
sands
rocks
bleached
like
bone
gave
an
effect
of
surf
on
an
unseen
shore
now
and
then
a
silent
arab
stealing
out
of
shadow
might
have
been
the
white
woman
who
haunts
the
sphinx
hurrying
to
a
fatal
tryst
and
the
great
pyramid
seemed
to
float
between
desert
sand
and
cloudless
sky
like
the
golden
palace
of
aladdin
being
transported
through
air
by
the
geni
of
the
lamp
there
never
was
such
gold
as
this
gold
of
sand
and
pyramids
under
the
moon
we
said
that
it
was
like
condensed
sun
rays
so
vivid
so
bright
that
the
moon
could
not
steal
its
colour
cloudlike
white
figures
were
running
up
geometric
mountain
arabs
expecting
money
when
they
should
come
leaping
down
whole
or
in
pieces
and
the
khaki
uniforms
of
british
soldiers
mounting
or
descending
for
their
own
stolid
amusement
made
the
pyramid
itself
seem
to
be
writhing
so
like
was
the
colour
of
the
cloth
to
that
of
the
stone
no
use
being
angry
because
the
monument
was
crawling
with
tommies
the
pyramids
were
as
much
theirs
as
ours
and
probably
napoleon
soldiers
spent
their
moonlit
evenings
in
the
same
way
a
thought
which
somehow
made
the
thing
seem
less
intolerable
we
climbed
to
the
vast
platform
of
the
ghizeh
pyramids
and
then
plunged
into
the
billows
of
the
desert
in
quest
of
the
sphinx
sir
marcus
was
entitled
to
call
himself
the
pioneer
but
we
needed
no
one
to
show
us
the
way
it
was
but
too
clearly
indicated
by
the
bands
of
pilgrims
going
or
returning
and
among
the
latter
were
those
whom
monny
callously
referred
to
as
poor
lord
ernest
crowd
miss
and
the
biddell
girls
made
us
linger
with
sand
trickling
over
the
tops
of
our
shoes
while
they
poured
into
our
ears
their
impressions
of
the
sphinx
miss
thought
that
she
with
a
capital
s
was
a
combination
of
goddess
prophetess
and
mystery
enid
thought
she
was
like
an
irish
washerwoman
making
a
face
and
elaine
said
she
was
the
image
of
their
bulldog
at
home
monny
after
a
sandy
introduction
listened
to
these
verbal
vandalisms
in
horrified
silence
i
could
see
that
she
was
exerting
herself
for
my
sake
to
be
civil
to
my
charges
who
were
more
interested
in
her
than
they
had
been
in
the
sphinx
and
that
if
she
could
have
done
so
without
hurting
their
feelings
she
would
have
struck
them
dead
but
my
fears
that
their
mental
suggestions
might
obsess
her
were
baseless
she
did
not
speak
when
the
golden
billows
parted
to
give
us
a
first
vision
of
the
great
mystery
of
the
desert
i
had
led
monny
by
a
roundabout
way
and
instead
of
seeing
the
sphinx
from
the
back
we
came
upon
her
face
to
face
as
she
gazed
with
her
wonderful
eyes
straight
into
that
world
beyond
knowledge
which
lies
somewhere
east
of
the
moon
veiled
by
the
night
in
silver
and
blue
with
a
proud
lift
of
the
head
she
faced
past
and
future
which
were
one
for
her
and
the
present
nothing
the
moon
gave
back
for
a
few
hours
all
her
lost
loveliness
of
which
men
had
robbed
her
seeming
miraculously
to
restore
the
broken
features
whole
and
beautiful
as
they
had
been
in
her
youth
before
history
began
it
was
as
if
in
the
moon
rays
were
silver
hands
mending
the
marred
majesty
giving
life
to
the
eyes
and
to
the
haunting
secret
smile
i
thought
of
the
story
of
king
harmachis
how
he
dreamed
that
the
sphinx
came
to
him
saying
that
the
sand
pressed
upon
her
and
she
could
not
breathe
nobody
since
his
day
had
for
long
left
her
buried
what
does
it
mean
to
you
i
broke
the
silence
to
ask
i
do
know
monny
said
all
i
know
is
that
she
more
wonderful
than
i
expected
and
as
beautiful
as
the
loveliest
marble
venus
of
italy
though
a
thousand
times
greater
if
one
perfect
thing
can
be
greater
than
another
she
so
great
that
i
do
think
she
can
be
meant
to
be
a
woman
or
even
a
man
she
is
like
a
carved
in
stone
all
in
a
moment
you
have
guessed
the
riddle
i
exclaimed
liking
and
understanding
the
girl
better
than
i
had
liked
or
understood
her
yet
i
believe
that
the
secret
of
the
sphinx
the
king
who
had
this
stupendous
idea
and
caused
it
to
be
carried
out
said
to
some
inspired
sculptor
for
me
from
the
rock
of
the
desert
a
portrait
not
of
me
as
i
am
seen
by
men
in
my
mortal
part
or
khat
for
that
can
be
placed
elsewhere
but
an
image
of
my
real
self
my
soul
or
ka
looking
past
the
small
things
of
this
world
into
eternity
which
lies
beyond
this
desert
and
all
deserts
then
the
sculptor
made
the
sphinx
and
gave
it
such
grandeur
such
mystery
of
countenance
that
instinctively
the
souls
of
people
recognized
the
you
have
a
soul
and
it
told
you
the
secret
only
those
who
have
no
souls
find
the
sphinx
heavy
or
hideous
or
utterly
beyond
their
comprehension
have
i
a
soul
monny
asked
dreamily
men
i
known
have
told
me
i
have
yet
sometimes
i
thought
i
felt
it
fluttering
and
if
i
have
a
soul
i
shall
find
it
in
egypt
oh
i
shall
something
yes
the
sphinx
herself
tells
me
that
i
was
tempted
to
ask
what
about
a
heart
and
then
in
a
violent
hurry
before
anybody
came
to
mention
my
own
into
which
the
moon
seemed
pouring
a
little
of
the
honey
it
had
brought
for
the
sphinx
i
did
feel
that
some
one
owed
a
moonlight
proposal
under
the
nose
or
the
place
where
its
nose
had
been
to
such
a
girl
as
monny
her
egyptian
experience
could
never
be
perfect
and
complete
unless
she
were
proposed
to
on
the
night
of
the
full
moon
with
the
blessing
and
as
no
better
man
was
here
to
do
it
i
could
not
be
thought
conceited
if
i
took
the
duty
upon
myself
besides
brigit
would
so
thoroughly
approve
look
here
biddy
i
mean
monny
i
began
hastily
there
something
i
want
to
tell
you
something
very
important
you
ought
to
know
because
matters
ca
go
on
much
longer
as
they
are
is
it
something
about
she
broke
in
with
a
little
gasp
as
i
paused
for
breath
and
courage
if
it
is
maybe
i
know
it
already
extraordinary
the
relief
i
felt
i
ought
to
have
suffered
a
shock
of
disappointment
because
i
could
possibly
finish
a
proposal
after
such
an
interruption
but
instead
my
spirits
went
up
with
a
bound
probably
however
that
was
because
her
hint
was
a
whip
to
my
curiosity
do
you
know
about
i
asked
perhaps
i
forgot
to
lower
my
voice
or
perhaps
voices
carry
far
across
as
across
water
anyhow
the
clear
tones
of
cleopatra
answered
like
an
echo
antoun
antoun
i
hear
lord
ernest
calling
biddy
dear
little
matchmaking
biddy
had
managed
sir
marcus
bill
bailey
and
rachel
as
a
circus
rider
manages
three
spirited
white
horses
at
one
time
the
desert
was
her
ring
and
she
had
reined
her
steeds
to
her
will
keeping
them
out
of
my
way
and
monny
at
all
costs
no
matter
whether
they
saw
the
sphinx
in
back
view
or
noseless
profile
but
east
principal
occupation
in
life
was
not
to
get
me
engaged
to
the
gilded
rose
and
either
she
lost
her
presence
of
mind
or
else
she
was
not
so
much
enjoying
her
moonlight
with
fenton
that
it
was
worth
while
to
hide
from
us
behind
a
sand
dune
the
two
emerged
from
a
gulf
of
shadow
anthony
very
splendid
under
the
moon
a
true
man
of
the
desert
i
thought
i
heard
monny
draw
in
a
little
sharp
breath
as
she
saw
that
noble
incarnation
of
egypt
so
he
must
have
seemed
unless
she
knew
the
british
reality
of
him
walking
beside
cleopatra
then
up
came
the
others
sir
marcus
impossible
to
restrain
and
we
all
talked
together
as
people
are
expected
to
talk
when
they
have
come
thousands
of
miles
to
see
these
monuments
of
egypt
yes
yes
wonderful
incredible
which
do
you
find
more
impressive
the
sphinx
or
the
pyramids
is
it
a
pity
they
let
the
temple
between
the
paws
remain
buried
and
are
the
pyramids
just
like
titanic
golden
beehives
and
ca
you
simply
the
swarming
builders
like
bees
themselves
working
for
twenty
years
thus
we
jabbered
and
others
many
others
appeared
to
dispute
the
scene
with
us
to
break
the
magic
of
the
moonlight
and
to
puncture
the
vast
silence
of
the
desert
with
their
cooings
and
gurglings
and
chatterings
in
german
english
arabic
and
every
other
language
known
since
the
tower
of
babel
arab
guides
lit
up
the
sphinx
with
flaring
magnesium
an
impertinence
that
should
have
made
hideous
with
hate
the
insulted
features
but
instead
turned
them
for
a
thrilling
instant
of
suspense
into
marble
indeed
none
of
our
petty
vulgarities
could
jar
or
even
fret
the
majestic
calm
of
the
desert
and
the
stone
mystery
among
its
billows
the
sphinx
gazed
above
and
past
us
all
she
was
like
some
royal
captive
surrounded
by
a
rabble
mob
yet
as
undisturbed
in
soul
as
though
her
puny
hooting
tormentors
had
no
existence
it
was
not
so
much
that
she
scorned
us
as
that
she
did
not
know
we
were
there
when
we
sorted
ourselves
out
to
escape
sir
marcus
cleopatra
deigned
to
make
use
of
me
having
first
observed
with
burning
interest
that
monny
and
rachel
were
with
bailey
and
that
antoun
was
pointing
things
out
to
brigit
as
it
is
man
métier
in
pictures
and
advertisements
to
point
things
out
to
woman
it
been
a
wonderful
evening
east
said
it
has
made
up
for
everything
i
suffered
last
night
we
brought
dinner
out
into
the
desert
in
that
smallest
you
know
and
ate
it
together
he
and
i
antony
and
i
there
i
may
as
well
confess
that
what
i
call
him
to
myself
for
i
guessed
your
secret
and
his
but
do
be
afraid
i
wo
tell
a
soul
it
too
romantic
and
fascinating
for
words
or
to
put
into
words
he
let
me
have
my
fortune
told
by
an
arab
sand
diviner
who
came
while
we
were
at
dinner
i
ca
repeat
to
you
what
the
said
but
i
feel
as
if
i
were
living
in
a
book
oh
if
only
i
were
writing
it
myself
and
could
make
everything
happen
just
as
i
want
it
to
happen
do
you
know
one
thing
i
would
put
into
the
story
no
i
ca
think
i
said
rather
anxiously
i
would
have
propose
to
monny
oh
by
jove
mrs
east
why
do
you
admire
her
but
of
course
she
irresistible
only
she
so
horribly
rich
and
besides
she
does
think
of
me
in
that
way
you
ca
be
sure
now
lord
ernest
i
going
to
whisper
you
a
secret
i
believe
i
really
do
that
monny
would
be
if
propose
if
i
were
in
your
place
if
i
her
i
would
do
so
as
soon
as
possible
it
might
save
her
from
humiliation
from
a
great
trouble
being
a
duffer
i
could
only
say
once
again
by
jove
chapter
xiii
an
underground
proposal
i
did
sleep
much
that
night
for
thinking
of
monny
and
when
i
did
sleep
i
dreamed
of
her
tangled
dreams
in
which
she
was
monny
gilder
with
brigit
eyes
could
it
be
possible
that
she
liked
me
east
ought
to
know
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
would
begin
by
feeling
my
way
but
when
came
i
had
no
time
to
feel
anything
which
concerned
my
private
affairs
it
seemed
or
so
i
was
told
for
my
own
good
by
miss
that
the
candace
people
thought
it
snobby
for
me
to
have
indulged
in
a
private
and
to
have
hustled
them
off
in
a
drove
to
the
sphinx
while
i
went
leisurely
with
my
smart
friends
they
knew
all
about
the
feast
on
the
roof
and
were
of
opinion
that
they
ought
to
have
been
there
did
i
consider
my
american
heiress
better
than
they
better
even
than
the
family
of
an
mayor
if
i
wished
to
make
up
lost
ground
i
must
devote
myself
to
duty
and
be
nicer
than
ever
to
everybody
this
was
one
of
the
moments
when
i
was
tempted
to
throw
over
my
job
but
i
remembered
the
reward
and
set
myself
once
more
to
the
earning
of
it
for
the
next
few
days
i
scarcely
saw
monny
or
brigit
or
even
heard
what
was
happening
to
them
for
they
had
done
the
principal
sights
of
cairo
and
i
at
the
head
of
the
crowd
was
doing
them
as
if
in
a
game
of
follow
my
leader
i
led
the
band
from
mosque
to
mosque
not
indeed
visiting
the
whole
two
hundred
and
but
calling
on
the
best
ones
to
begin
with
i
collected
the
set
on
the
height
of
the
citadel
which
commands
all
cairo
the
platform
of
the
pyramids
not
only
the
ghizeh
pyramids
but
the
sixty
odd
others
which
newcomers
do
talk
about
the
tawny
mokattam
hills
and
the
serpent
of
the
nile
from
this
vantage
place
i
pointed
out
the
things
we
had
to
see
in
the
city
spread
out
below
us
so
that
on
the
vaguest
minds
the
picture
might
be
painted
in
its
entirety
before
they
began
to
absorb
details
on
that
mosaic
map
which
was
cairo
the
tombs
of
the
mamelukes
strangely
shaped
monuments
vague
and
white
as
squatting
ghosts
the
graves
of
the
caliphs
the
historic
gates
of
and
the
many
ancient
mosques
whose
minarets
soared
against
the
blue
like
flowers
in
a
palace
garden
mentally
fortified
by
this
view
from
the
citadel
of
course
i
had
to
trot
them
up
again
for
the
sunset
my
charges
let
themselves
be
led
from
mosque
to
mosque
from
tomb
to
tomb
some
possessed
with
a
demoniac
desire
to
get
their
money
worth
of
egypt
were
unable
to
enjoy
any
sight
in
their
nervous
dread
of
missing
some
other
spectacle
which
people
at
home
might
ask
them
about
these
strained
their
wearied
intelligences
to
see
more
than
they
possibly
could
at
any
one
moment
unless
they
had
eyes
all
round
their
heads
and
others
of
an
even
more
irritating
type
never
lifted
the
few
eyes
they
had
from
the
pages
of
i
liked
better
those
who
like
monny
frankly
said
that
they
did
wish
to
have
their
minds
tidied
up
and
be
told
a
string
of
things
about
egypt
they
just
wanted
to
the
things
and
let
them
slowly
soak
in
and
the
nice
lazy
southern
americans
who
said
they
were
tomb
shy
and
loitered
about
betting
from
one
to
six
scarabs
on
the
speed
of
fleas
or
donkeys
while
i
whipped
forth
for
their
tired
companions
a
dull
drove
of
facts
fattened
for
their
benefit
mosques
and
churches
and
tombs
had
to
be
visited
but
did
not
appeal
to
all
tastes
the
bazaars
did
so
did
the
zoo
more
fascinating
than
any
other
zoo
because
each
animal
has
its
trick
or
pet
or
plaything
as
an
excuse
to
see
monny
and
the
rest
of
my
friends
i
got
up
a
moonlight
digging
expedition
at
fustat
those
great
mounds
of
rubbish
and
buried
treasure
near
egyptian
babylon
where
a
city
was
burnt
lest
it
should
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
crusaders
monny
and
her
party
were
invited
to
join
us
and
accepted
the
invitation
piloted
by
antoun
and
concerning
this
entertainment
i
had
an
idea
those
who
choose
to
dig
among
these
sandhills
between
the
coptic
churches
of
babylon
and
the
tombs
of
the
mamelukes
may
chance
on
something
of
value
especially
after
a
windstorm
or
a
landslip
bits
of
persian
pottery
fragments
of
iridescent
glass
broken
bracelets
of
enamel
opaline
beads
or
tiny
gods
and
goddesses
why
should
i
not
thought
i
apportion
off
to
each
member
of
the
band
his
or
her
own
digging
patch
this
would
save
squabbling
and
would
provide
an
opportunity
for
me
to
propose
in
a
unique
way
to
monny
regarding
the
idea
as
an
inspiration
i
carried
it
out
scientifically
helped
by
anthony
after
the
sun
had
set
and
the
mounds
were
deserted
i
staked
out
the
most
promising
claims
and
marked
each
space
with
the
name
of
the
miner
for
whom
i
intended
it
in
monny
patch
near
the
surface
where
she
could
not
possibly
miss
it
i
buried
a
letter
wrapped
round
a
head
of
hathor
which
i
had
bought
at
the
egyptian
now
in
justice
to
myself
i
must
tell
you
that
this
letter
was
no
common
letter
such
as
any
tom
dick
or
harry
may
write
to
the
mary
jane
smith
of
the
moment
it
was
a
missive
which
cost
me
midnight
electricity
and
for
not
only
must
i
appeal
to
my
lady
i
must
also
suit
an
environment
monny
had
taken
up
the
study
of
hieroglyphics
in
order
to
appreciate
intelligently
the
tombs
and
temples
of
the
nile
she
had
bought
books
and
was
learning
with
the
energy
of
a
stenographer
to
write
and
read
she
wrote
out
exercises
and
submitted
them
for
correction
to
antoun
who
as
an
egyptian
was
to
be
considered
an
authority
of
course
she
explained
to
me
one
comes
here
thinking
that
all
egyptians
nowadays
even
copts
are
arabs
but
says
that
egyptians
are
as
egyptian
as
they
ever
were
because
arab
invasion
has
left
little
more
trace
in
their
blood
than
the
romans
left
in
the
blood
of
the
english
it
interests
me
more
to
feel
when
i
in
egypt
that
i
among
real
egyptians
with
this
in
my
mind
i
was
convinced
that
a
love
letter
in
hieroglyphics
unearthed
by
moonlight
in
the
mounds
of
fustat
would
please
monny
the
difficulty
was
that
though
i
could
speak
arabic
fairly
well
i
hardly
knew
the
difference
between
hieroglyphic
hieratic
and
demotic
forms
but
the
limited
symbols
i
was
able
to
employ
were
so
strong
in
themselves
that
a
few
would
go
a
long
way
and
if
they
were
not
as
correct
as
the
sentiments
they
expressed
monny
was
not
herself
a
mistress
of
hieroglyphic
style
i
could
find
no
hieroglyphic
suit
in
which
to
clothe
the
name
ernest
but
since
i
had
become
keeper
of
men
mice
and
morals
in
sir
marcus
lark
floating
zoo
monny
craze
for
egyptianizing
everything
had
suggested
the
nickname
of
she
sometimes
called
me
rã
for
short
therefore
i
now
ventured
to
divert
to
my
own
uses
a
sign
and
cartouche
once
the
property
of
a
son
of
the
sun
and
king
of
egypt
illustration
the
love
letter
translation
beautiful
queen
star
of
my
heart
and
soul
give
me
your
love
become
my
wife
and
goddess
for
eternity
ka
rã
i
patted
myself
on
the
back
put
the
letter
in
the
ground
and
the
digging
party
was
a
wild
success
but
time
passed
on
and
i
had
no
answer
what
i
expected
was
a
reply
in
kind
an
hieratic
acceptance
or
a
demotic
refusal
either
one
would
be
good
practice
for
monny
but
not
a
hieroglyph
of
any
description
came
i
had
to
go
on
as
if
nothing
had
happened
to
be
ignored
was
less
tolerable
than
being
refused
silence
began
to
get
upon
my
nerves
and
to
make
matters
worse
there
was
that
desert
trip
hanging
over
my
head
i
knew
even
less
about
organizing
a
desert
trip
than
i
knew
about
hieroglyphics
yet
it
had
to
be
done
as
sir
marcus
said
it
was
up
to
me
to
do
it
so
well
that
cook
would
look
sick
anthony
was
absorbed
in
secret
official
duties
and
open
unofficial
duties
his
was
a
great
thinking
part
and
our
occupations
kept
us
apart
rather
than
brought
us
together
on
the
one
occasion
when
we
were
alone
he
devoted
four
out
of
five
minutes
to
telling
me
what
he
had
learned
of
the
night
disturbance
in
front
of
the
house
of
the
crocodile
a
britisher
of
sorts
had
come
into
the
street
guided
by
an
arab
there
had
been
some
dispute
about
payment
and
the
britisher
had
slapped
the
dragoman
face
this
had
been
followed
as
he
might
have
known
it
would
with
a
stab
a
crowd
had
assembled
and
scattered
before
the
police
the
stabbed
one
had
gone
to
hospital
the
stabber
to
prison
altogether
it
was
not
surprising
that
mansoor
the
suspicious
caretaker
had
feared
a
trap
and
closed
his
doors
bedr
el
gemály
now
one
of
the
great
unemployed
had
been
seen
near
the
hospital
where
the
injured
man
lay
but
he
had
taken
the
alarm
and
departed
without
inquiring
for
the
invalid
health
or
else
his
being
in
that
neighbourhood
was
a
coincidence
the
name
of
the
man
knifed
was
burke
and
london
was
given
as
his
address
he
was
between
and
forty
and
according
to
the
arrested
dragoman
was
not
a
gentleman
but
a
tourist
his
hurt
was
not
severe
and
as
the
arab
had
been
exasperated
by
a
blow
the
punishment
would
not
be
excessive
when
at
length
i
had
seized
the
last
remaining
minute
to
put
the
question
do
you
think
miss
gilder
has
found
out
who
you
really
are
fenton
seemed
astonished
i
had
thought
of
it
at
all
he
answered
simply
she
giving
me
too
many
other
things
to
think
of
what
kind
of
things
i
stealthily
inquired
oh
with
an
evasive
air
i
do
know
what
to
make
of
her
yet
but
i
have
given
up
my
silly
scheme
what
silly
scheme
antoun
looked
almost
sulky
well
if
you
forgotten
i
remind
you
it
absurd
it
even
brutal
and
i
ashamed
of
it
but
i
stick
to
it
chapter
xiv
the
desert
diary
begun
i
found
out
why
monny
paid
no
attention
to
my
buried
letter
but
the
way
in
which
i
found
it
out
and
several
other
things
at
the
same
time
is
part
of
the
desert
trip
i
am
not
a
man
whose
soul
turns
to
diaries
for
consolation
but
i
did
keep
up
a
bowing
acquaintance
with
a
notebook
in
egypt
it
helped
me
with
my
lectures
and
in
the
desert
it
relieved
my
feelings
looking
over
the
desert
pages
i
tempted
to
give
them
as
they
stand
morning
the
start
for
monday
and
nothing
done
could
i
develop
symptoms
of
creeping
paralysis
and
throw
the
responsibility
on
anthony
but
too
late
for
that
now
and
he
may
have
to
stay
on
in
cairo
for
a
day
or
two
why
did
i
leave
my
peaceful
home
it
the
lure
of
the
mountain
of
the
golden
pyramid
last
night
before
i
went
to
bed
read
over
my
copy
of
ferlini
letters
to
gain
courage
gained
it
for
a
little
but
when
i
think
of
that
desert
i
supposed
to
turn
into
a
happy
playground
for
trippers
and
not
a
tent
hired
or
a
prune
bought
or
an
egg
laid
for
all
i
know
i
wish
anthony
and
i
had
let
lark
stick
to
our
mountain
this
is
lark
fault
anyhow
he
sprang
the
thing
on
me
said
it
would
be
easy
as
falling
off
a
log
said
cairo
was
full
of
arabs
whose
mission
in
life
was
supplying
tents
and
utensils
for
desert
tours
people
would
be
charmed
with
simple
life
and
me
as
universal
provider
all
i
had
to
do
was
to
supply
cheap
editions
of
the
garden
of
allah
and
plenty
of
dates
and
hint
that
it
was
considered
vulgar
in
the
best
circles
to
put
on
pêche
melba
airs
in
the
desert
with
a
few
quotations
i
should
make
them
content
with
a
loaf
of
bread
a
cup
of
wine
and
why
they
be
falling
in
love
with
each
other
under
the
desert
stars
and
my
principal
occupation
would
be
saying
bless
you
my
children
sounded
neat
and
i
remembered
that
according
to
brigit
monny
wanted
the
desert
to
take
her
thought
it
might
be
useful
if
i
were
on
in
that
act
abyssmal
beast
of
a
dragoman
who
lurks
round
mena
house
buoyed
me
up
with
false
hopes
said
he
had
a
fine
outfit
which
he
let
and
threw
himself
in
as
guide
plenty
of
everything
including
cheek
for
fifteen
people
the
exact
number
who
have
put
down
their
names
to
go
some
girls
and
parents
are
staying
for
a
ball
at
the
semiramis
where
i
tearfully
persuaded
the
only
officers
i
know
to
dance
with
them
otherwise
the
lot
would
have
been
on
my
hands
in
the
desert
had
so
much
to
do
yesterday
taking
the
crowd
to
matariyeh
where
the
holy
family
hid
in
a
hollow
tree
that
i
had
no
time
to
look
at
the
arab
outfit
was
inclined
to
save
trouble
and
trust
him
but
saw
anthony
a
minute
last
night
he
urged
me
to
inspect
everything
did
so
early
this
morning
rotten
outfit
tents
like
old
patchwork
quilts
pots
and
pans
probably
bought
job
lot
from
noah
when
the
ark
was
docked
those
keenest
on
desert
taking
them
will
be
mad
as
hatters
if
it
takes
them
in
suppose
i
have
to
interview
half
the
arabs
in
cairo
wish
i
had
a
ka
or
ba
or
whatever
you
get
for
an
astral
body
in
egypt
and
i
could
say
to
it
here
my
dear
chap
i
trust
you
to
do
this
job
while
i
stay
in
cairo
and
rest
my
features
then
get
the
blame
and
i
disappear
never
to
be
seen
again
or
if
he
were
a
ka
with
cook
accomplishments
maybe
he
bring
the
thing
off
all
right
in
which
case
i
could
turn
up
and
take
the
credit
and
marry
monny
happy
thought
cook
why
should
i
sneak
to
cook
and
inquire
in
a
careless
way
if
they
publish
any
pamphlet
on
how
to
do
a
desert
tour
have
been
to
cook
no
pamphlet
but
a
friend
in
need
talk
of
casting
bread
on
the
waters
in
rome
i
cast
a
crust
which
i
want
and
it
come
back
in
cairo
with
butter
and
sugar
on
it
must
have
been
two
years
ago
in
rome
when
a
young
chap
wrote
to
me
to
the
embassy
said
he
been
disappointed
in
getting
work
he
come
abroad
for
had
seen
my
name
recognized
it
was
from
my
county
and
could
i
use
him
as
a
stenographer
or
anything
i
could
but
i
found
him
some
one
who
could
and
forgot
him
till
i
saw
him
this
morning
a
fully
fledged
clerk
at
cook
checking
the
impulse
to
fall
on
his
neatly
striped
blue
and
white
bosom
i
invited
him
to
lunch
and
as
a
reward
for
what
he
calls
past
and
present
favours
he
had
given
me
new
life
what
i
mean
to
say
is
he
promised
to
provide
me
not
only
with
tents
but
camels
and
and
a
camp
chef
and
waiters
and
washbowls
and
a
desert
dragoman
and
thousands
of
things
i
never
thought
of
it
seems
practically
certain
that
since
napoleon
no
such
genius
has
been
born
as
slaney
cleopatra
would
say
that
is
the
reincarnation
of
napoleon
but
neither
cleopatra
nor
any
one
else
above
all
sir
marcus
lark
is
to
know
of
his
existence
such
is
the
disinterested
of
this
crust
that
it
will
do
everything
for
me
while
keeping
itself
and
the
organization
which
controls
it
completely
in
the
background
the
organization
is
too
great
to
mind
and
the
crust
alias
slaney
thinks
itself
too
small
lark
considers
himself
a
budding
rival
of
the
firm
of
cook
but
a
deadly
bud
if
however
sir
should
come
to
hear
that
i
had
flown
for
succour
to
the
enemy
camp
i
fear
it
would
be
all
over
with
the
bargain
for
which
anthony
and
i
are
selling
our
souls
slaney
says
he
never
shall
know
he
guarantees
that
cook
labels
and
other
telltale
marks
shall
be
removed
from
everything
though
time
is
short
and
there
is
much
to
do
he
will
be
the
power
behind
the
tents
and
i
will
be
in
them
absorbing
all
the
credit
all
de
thanks
to
slaney
should
like
to
get
him
canonized
many
less
worthy
men
now
deceased
have
been
given
the
right
to
put
saint
before
their
names
he
has
handed
me
a
list
something
less
than
a
mile
long
of
articles
which
biddy
and
i
as
children
used
to
call
eaties
and
drinkies
he
has
told
me
where
the
things
can
be
bought
and
has
written
a
letter
of
introduction
which
secures
me
highest
consideration
and
lowest
prices
also
he
has
suggested
a
packs
of
cards
the
newest
games
cigarettes
suited
to
european
and
arab
tastes
picture
of
desert
scenes
ink
pens
and
writing
paper
people
forget
everything
they
want
on
these
trips
but
you
must
said
he
i
have
acted
on
all
his
suggestions
and
feel
as
proud
as
if
i
had
originated
them
myself
my
precious
friend
slaney
has
made
a
large
collection
of
arabs
camels
tents
and
ordered
everything
animate
and
inanimate
to
assemble
in
the
neighbourhood
of
mena
house
this
afternoon
in
order
to
be
inspected
by
me
and
to
be
ready
for
a
start
early
morning
we
are
to
have
a
sandcart
with
a
desert
horse
for
cleopatra
who
has
tried
a
camel
and
found
it
wanting
i
fancy
she
thinks
a
sandcart
the
best
modern
substitute
for
a
chariot
and
at
worst
it
ought
to
be
as
comfortable
slaney
has
promised
a
yellow
one
cart
not
horse
the
horse
by
request
is
to
be
white
the
other
ladies
are
having
camels
i
dare
think
of
miss
at
the
end
of
the
week
the
men
also
will
camel
there
is
indeed
no
alternative
between
camelling
and
sandcarting
sandcarting
not
recommended
by
the
faculty
but
insisted
upon
by
cleopatra
hope
it
will
work
out
all
right
and
am
inclined
to
be
optimistic
a
week
in
the
desert
and
the
flowery
oasis
of
the
fayum
with
the
two
most
charming
women
in
egypt
there
will
be
others
but
there
a
man
each
and
more
i
shall
have
to
look
after
monny
and
brigit
as
anthony
is
having
his
hands
full
with
cleopatra
lately
and
besides
he
ca
start
with
us
something
keeps
him
in
cairo
for
two
days
more
and
he
will
have
to
join
us
near
tomieh
evening
back
from
great
pyramid
where
i
went
to
inspect
the
assembling
army
magnificent
is
the
only
word
the
camels
fine
animals
but
anthony
has
provided
the
three
best
borrowing
these
aristocrats
of
the
camel
world
from
major
gunter
of
the
coast
guard
they
have
chased
hasheesh
smugglers
and
have
seen
desert
fighting
were
snarling
horribly
when
i
was
introduced
but
a
snarl
as
superior
to
the
common
snarls
of
as
their
legs
are
superior
in
shape
biddy
monny
east
and
rachel
guest
were
there
with
sir
and
antoun
having
been
inside
the
pyramid
and
up
to
the
top
monny
on
her
high
horse
because
antoun
says
it
will
be
better
for
the
ladies
to
ride
the
the
others
take
his
word
meekly
but
she
persists
and
anthony
agrees
to
give
her
the
camel
he
had
meant
to
ride
the
one
supposed
to
be
the
most
spirited
when
he
joins
us
he
will
have
the
animal
intended
for
her
when
this
bargain
was
struck
between
them
i
thought
his
eyes
looked
dangerous
but
she
did
notice
or
care
fenton
tells
me
he
has
dreamed
again
of
the
man
with
the
purple
moustache
i
laughed
at
his
bugbear
and
flung
colonel
corkran
in
his
teeth
by
the
way
nothing
has
been
heard
of
by
any
of
us
since
the
day
he
handed
in
his
resignation
suppose
he
has
gone
back
to
england
in
the
sulks
night
i
am
writing
in
my
tent
which
is
to
be
shared
with
anthony
when
he
arrives
i
feel
years
older
than
when
we
started
this
morning
middle
age
seems
to
have
overtaken
me
if
i
keep
on
at
this
rate
shall
be
a
centenarian
by
the
time
we
get
back
to
cairo
we
made
a
splendid
caravan
at
the
start
besides
the
train
of
camels
ridden
by
my
party
from
the
and
monny
gilder
with
her
satellites
it
goes
against
the
grain
though
to
call
a
bright
particular
star
like
biddy
a
satellite
there
were
over
thirty
gigantic
beasts
laden
with
our
numerous
bedroom
kitchen
luncheon
and
food
for
humans
fodder
for
animals
casks
of
water
mattresses
other
tent
furniture
tourists
luggage
and
so
on
i
was
happy
till
after
the
had
got
away
each
camel
with
its
head
roped
to
the
tail
of
the
one
ahead
all
trailing
off
toward
the
distant
pyramids
of
sakkhara
well
in
advance
of
us
each
camel
looked
like
a
on
top
of
the
load
was
perched
the
chêf
a
singularly
withered
old
gentleman
with
black
and
blue
complexion
clad
in
a
vague
flying
blanket
has
been
man
in
paris
hotels
many
other
negroid
persons
in
white
with
large
turbans
a
few
café
au
lait
arabs
these
all
counted
beforehand
by
slaney
for
me
and
identified
as
waiters
and
enough
apparently
to
stock
a
village
but
we
had
one
surprise
at
the
moment
of
starting
in
the
form
of
a
bright
black
child
clad
in
white
with
a
white
skull
cap
and
a
flat
profile
evidently
copied
from
the
sphinx
i
do
know
yet
why
this
baby
sphinx
has
come
or
who
he
is
but
he
rode
on
the
tail
hanging
on
by
the
bread
our
bread
which
was
in
a
bag
when
this
cavalcade
had
wound
away
the
camels
making
blue
tracks
in
the
yellow
sand
it
was
our
turn
to
start
not
one
of
us
would
have
changed
places
with
any
old
egyptian
king
or
queen
and
we
did
not
feel
vulgar
for
doing
this
trip
in
luxury
because
ancient
royalties
had
done
the
same
and
so
do
the
great
sheikhs
of
the
desert
even
now
as
i
put
cleopatra
into
the
sandcart
with
its
broad
wheels
she
was
recalling
the
days
when
she
travelled
with
a
train
of
asses
in
order
to
have
milk
for
her
bath
i
suggested
a
modern
condensed
substitute
but
the
offer
was
not
received
in
the
spirit
with
which
it
was
made
now
to
get
the
ladies
on
their
camels
after
which
we
men
would
vault
upon
our
animals
and
wind
away
among
billowing
dunes
full
of
shadowy
ripples
and
high
lights
like
velvet
but
just
here
arose
the
first
small
cloud
in
the
blue
it
was
bigger
than
a
man
hand
for
it
was
the
exact
size
and
shape
of
miss
hat
it
was
a
largish
hat
of
imitation
panama
trimmed
with
green
veiling
just
the
hat
for
a
desert
all
pink
sunset
and
no
wind
as
she
was
about
to
mount
the
squatting
camel
a
breeze
blew
the
flap
over
her
eyes
this
prevented
miss
from
seeing
that
the
camel
had
turned
its
neck
to
look
at
her
and
so
as
she
reached
the
saddle
and
the
hat
blew
up
lady
and
camel
met
face
to
face
it
was
a
moment
of
suspense
for
neither
liked
the
other
at
first
sight
the
camel
began
to
gurgle
its
throat
in
a
threatening
manner
and
at
the
same
time
to
rise
miss
staring
into
two
quivering
nostrils
shaped
like
badly
made
purses
shrieked
forgot
whether
she
must
first
bend
forward
or
bend
back
bent
in
the
way
she
ought
not
to
have
bent
and
fell
upon
the
sand
i
do
quite
see
why
i
was
to
blame
for
this
result
but
she
and
said
i
ought
to
have
warned
her
what
a
vile
creature
a
camel
was
nothing
would
induce
her
to
try
again
she
would
go
to
any
extreme
rather
than
ride
a
beast
with
a
snake
for
a
neck
and
a
nasty
unsympathetic
face
full
of
green
juice
which
it
spit
out
at
you
she
was
used
to
being
liked
she
simply
could
go
about
on
a
thing
which
would
never
love
her
and
she
would
want
it
to
if
it
did
she
would
go
home
or
else
she
would
have
a
sandcart
all
the
neighbouring
sandcarts
were
engaged
but
fortunately
antoun
effendi
appeared
at
that
instant
he
taxied
out
to
see
us
off
and
he
persuaded
cleopatra
to
let
miss
drive
with
her
the
desert
horse
feeling
this
extra
weight
looked
round
almost
as
unsympathetically
as
the
camel
had
but
nobody
paid
the
slightest
attention
except
his
attendant
who
was
to
lead
him
a
type
of
negro
nut
who
had
a
snobbish
habit
of
reddening
his
nails
with
henna
by
this
time
a
crowd
had
assembled
kept
in
check
by
the
tall
sheikh
of
the
pyramids
it
consisted
mostly
of
arabs
determined
to
take
our
photographs
or
sell
us
scarabs
which
miss
refused
on
the
ground
that
she
disliked
things
off
dead
people
but
on
the
fringe
lurked
a
few
europeans
amused
to
see
so
large
a
caravan
setting
forth
and
the
men
of
our
party
hitherto
proud
of
their
curtained
helmets
and
desert
became
under
a
fire
of
snapshots
hello
my
boy
scout
i
was
hailed
by
sir
marcus
arriving
three
minutes
behind
anthony
and
on
the
same
errand
this
blow
to
my
fell
as
i
was
leading
monny
to
the
white
camel
which
was
hers
and
should
have
been
anthony
she
laughed
i
suppose
she
help
it
i
could
myself
if
it
had
been
harry
snell
or
bill
bailey
but
as
it
was
my
pride
of
khaki
helmet
knickers
and
puttees
collapsed
like
a
burst
balloon
i
seemed
to
feel
the
calves
of
my
legs
wither
it
was
in
this
mood
that
i
had
to
put
monny
on
that
coastguard
camel
while
antoun
stood
looking
on
he
did
not
offer
to
help
the
girl
as
their
talk
yesterday
on
the
subject
of
versus
running
camels
had
not
conduced
to
officiousness
monny
was
in
white
broad
white
helmet
such
as
women
wear
white
suede
shoes
white
silk
stockings
and
a
lot
of
lacy
things
that
showed
frills
when
she
flew
birdlike
onto
the
cushioned
saddle
the
way
to
do
it
i
heard
her
cry
exultantly
and
what
happened
next
i
ca
say
for
the
white
camel
knocked
me
over
as
it
bounded
up
jerking
its
nose
rope
from
the
leader
hand
and
the
next
thing
i
knew
it
was
making
for
the
horizon
i
had
been
on
a
camel
since
i
was
four
if
then
so
it
was
useless
to
follow
but
while
i
stood
spitting
out
sand
anthony
flung
himself
onto
one
of
the
swift
coastguard
beasts
and
was
after
her
like
a
streak
of
lightning
none
of
us
had
the
nerve
to
continue
our
operations
until
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
they
appeared
from
behind
the
great
pyramid
coming
at
a
walk
antoun
holding
the
bridle
of
monny
camel
i
saw
by
fenton
face
that
he
intended
to
make
no
suggestions
and
i
guessed
that
he
was
practising
his
chosen
method
if
miss
gilder
wished
for
anything
she
must
ask
for
it
and
ask
for
it
humbly
if
she
expected
to
get
it
her
face
too
was
a
study
she
was
pale
and
even
piteous
i
thought
there
were
tears
in
the
eyes
and
if
i
had
been
anthony
i
could
not
have
hardened
my
heart
pride
or
no
pride
i
should
have
begged
her
to
abandon
this
praiseworthy
adventure
and
deign
to
mount
the
baggage
brute
not
so
anthony
he
led
back
the
camel
with
monny
limply
sitting
on
it
and
when
it
had
calmed
down
at
sight
of
its
friends
he
retired
into
the
background
how
wonderful
that
you
kept
on
darling
exclaimed
biddy
i
did
said
monny
then
she
turned
to
antoun
who
remained
on
his
beast
in
case
of
another
emergency
or
because
he
did
not
wish
to
be
looked
down
upon
by
her
he
was
rather
glorious
enthroned
on
his
camel
the
only
one
of
our
party
who
was
truly
in
the
desert
picture
i
did
blame
him
for
stopping
up
there
on
his
sheepskin
eye
to
eye
with
the
girl
for
a
moment
monny
did
not
speak
she
was
evidently
hesitating
what
to
do
but
common
sense
and
natural
sweetness
got
the
better
of
false
pride
antoun
you
were
right
and
i
was
wrong
she
admitted
i
said
yesterday
that
you
were
selfish
keeping
the
coastguard
camels
for
yourself
and
lord
ernest
and
general
harlow
and
giving
us
women
the
baggage
ones
now
i
sorry
i
was
silly
and
hateful
i
would
ride
another
fifty
yards
on
this
demon
for
fifty
thousand
dollars
nearly
broken
my
back
and
if
it
had
been
for
you
he
would
quite
have
done
it
please
help
me
off
and
put
me
on
any
old
baggage
thing
that
nobody
else
wants
anthony
eyes
lit
for
an
instant
from
satisfaction
as
a
man
or
from
christian
joy
in
her
moral
improvement
he
sprang
off
his
camel
brought
monny
animal
to
its
knees
helped
her
off
and
motioned
to
the
arab
attendant
of
the
ugly
duckling
of
all
the
other
creatures
it
gave
the
effect
of
being
a
cross
between
a
camel
and
an
ostrich
and
had
been
chosen
by
antoun
as
his
own
mount
when
he
surrendered
the
aristocrat
to
monny
oh
dearest
i
ca
have
you
ride
that
grasshopper
cried
biddy
took
it
for
himself
very
kindly
because
it
the
worst
and
i
do
care
any
more
than
he
did
give
the
thing
to
me
and
take
one
that
dear
creature
with
the
blue
bead
necklace
but
anthony
answered
for
monny
mademoiselle
gilder
made
a
bargain
with
me
yesterday
he
said
if
she
failed
in
what
wanted
to
do
she
was
to
do
what
wanted
her
to
do
i
think
she
will
wish
to
keep
her
bargain
i
i
wish
to
added
monny
with
a
chastened
not
to
say
shattered
air
she
curled
herself
up
on
the
cushion
which
was
the
ugly
duckling
saddle
this
time
it
was
antoun
who
settled
her
into
place
with
her
feet
meekly
crossed
and
the
caricature
of
a
camel
rose
like
a
sofa
at
a
spiritualistic
séance
strange
to
say
however
when
all
were
ready
to
start
monny
appeared
more
comfortably
lodged
than
any
of
the
ladies
and
the
thought
entered
my
mind
that
perhaps
anthony
had
with
extreme
subtlety
taken
this
roundabout
way
of
benefitting
miss
gilder
after
this
we
got
off
with
only
a
few
minor
mishaps
the
one
remaining
incident
of
note
was
the
arrival
on
the
scene
as
we
left
it
of
another
caravan
a
small
caravan
consisting
of
two
europeans
a
few
laden
camels
and
marshalled
by
one
dragoman
the
dragoman
was
bedr
el
gemály
and
he
smiled
at
us
as
affectionately
as
though
we
had
not
driven
him
from
us
in
disgrace
how
forgiving
arabs
are
even
when
they
not
converted
remarked
rachel
guest
by
whose
side
i
happened
to
be
riding
he
is
an
arab
said
i
he
an
armenian
and
both
are
supposed
to
be
the
reverse
of
forgiving
but
he
found
another
job
quickly
so
he
can
afford
to
let
bygones
be
bygones
oh
he
would
miss
guest
exclaimed
warmly
poor
fellow
you
all
done
him
a
great
injustice
but
i
thankful
he
not
going
to
suffer
for
it
i
wonder
if
he
and
his
people
are
bound
the
same
way
we
are
i
feared
that
this
was
likely
to
be
the
case
as
we
were
going
the
conventional
round
sticking
as
one
might
say
to
suburban
desert
on
our
way
to
the
fayum
but
as
monny
observed
the
other
night
we
could
engage
the
desert
like
a
private
i
would
however
have
preferred
sharing
it
with
most
people
rather
than
bedr
and
his
clients
though
the
two
latter
looked
singularly
harmless
almost
germanic
we
went
on
more
or
less
happily
though
i
noticed
that
whenever
a
camel
changed
its
walk
for
a
trot
each
one
of
the
ladies
reached
back
a
desperate
hand
to
clutch
the
saddle
and
save
her
spine
from
the
bruising
bump
bump
which
smote
the
bone
with
every
step
as
for
me
that
feeling
of
middle
age
began
to
creep
on
while
my
camel
and
i
were
getting
acquainted
i
tried
to
distract
my
thoughts
from
the
end
of
my
spine
by
concentrating
them
in
admiration
upon
the
scene
there
was
the
sphinx
welcoming
us
with
an
immense
smile
of
benevolence
as
suitable
to
the
sunshine
as
had
been
her
mysterious
solemnity
to
the
moonlight
there
far
away
to
the
left
the
citadel
floated
in
translucent
azure
its
domes
and
minarets
and
the
long
serrated
line
of
the
mokattam
hills
were
carved
against
the
sky
in
the
of
pink
topaz
shafts
of
light
gave
to
jagged
shapes
and
terraces
of
rock
on
the
low
mountains
an
appearance
of
temples
and
palaces
very
noble
and
splendid
as
must
have
been
the
first
glimpse
of
ancient
egypt
to
fugitives
from
famine
in
palestine
between
us
and
the
nile
hiding
the
sparkling
water
as
we
rode
went
a
dark
line
of
palms
purple
with
glints
of
green
in
the
distance
hundreds
of
tiny
birds
flew
up
into
the
burning
blue
like
a
black
spray
and
the
sand
was
patterned
by
their
feet
in
designs
intricate
as
lace
wherever
lay
a
patch
of
white
and
yellow
flowers
or
of
rough
grass
no
bigger
than
a
prayer
rug
a
lark
soared
from
its
nest
singing
its
and
here
and
there
a
gentle
hoopoo
reared
the
crown
which
rewarded
it
for
guiding
lost
king
solomon
and
his
starving
army
to
safety
all
this
was
beautiful
but
i
wondered
painfully
if
monny
could
be
happy
in
spite
of
the
bumps
now
that
the
desert
was
taking
her
strange
how
a
disagreeable
sensation
constantly
repeated
at
the
end
of
a
mere
bone
can
change
a
man
outlook
on
life
if
monny
had
come
to
my
and
whispered
i
found
your
buried
letter
oh
behold
that
bird
now
flying
toward
you
it
is
my
ba
my
heart
or
carrying
the
gift
of
my
love
i
should
with
difficulty
have
prevented
myself
from
snapping
out
thanks
very
much
but
my
good
girl
i
in
no
mood
to
talk
it
was
sympathy
kind
friendly
sympathy
i
yearned
for
not
spoken
in
words
but
given
from
soft
sweet
eyes
as
little
biddy
had
given
it
when
i
tore
my
hands
and
barked
my
shins
on
the
rocks
a
hundred
years
ago
i
think
we
should
have
liked
the
excuse
to
stop
and
gaze
at
the
ruinous
pyramids
of
abusir
but
the
supplied
by
slaney
urged
us
on
to
the
great
plateau
of
the
pyramids
and
necropolis
of
sakkara
there
on
the
terrace
of
marriette
house
we
saw
a
crowd
of
tourists
from
bedrachen
and
i
had
some
moments
of
guilty
fear
lest
my
secret
should
leak
out
as
their
dragoman
rushed
down
and
warmly
greeted
ours
but
in
the
throes
of
rolling
off
their
camels
for
the
first
time
the
suspicions
of
the
set
were
submerged
under
physical
emotions
it
an
ill
camel
that
bumps
no
one
any
good
i
was
only
too
glad
to
lure
my
charges
away
from
and
luckily
it
was
so
early
that
the
influential
ones
who
never
lunched
until
two
at
home
gave
the
word
tombs
before
food
girding
up
its
aching
loins
the
procession
allowed
itself
to
be
led
by
me
and
my
dragoman
down
inclined
planes
into
dark
mysteriously
warm
passages
where
our
lights
were
wandering
red
stars
now
and
then
a
face
would
start
suddenly
out
of
the
gloom
haloed
with
and
in
this
way
biddy
flashed
upon
me
oh
i
glad
to
see
you
she
whispered
bedr
and
his
two
tourists
are
here
i
afraid
my
dear
child
i
said
soothingly
but
not
as
soothingly
as
if
i
had
had
toothache
in
the
spine
you
may
be
afraid
of
bedr
but
hardly
of
two
stout
germans
in
check
suits
not
if
they
germans
but
are
they
just
now
one
of
their
candles
almost
collided
with
mine
and
his
eyes
stared
so
then
they
looked
over
my
head
at
monny
who
was
behind
me
and
where
she
is
now
heaven
knows
nothing
can
happen
to
either
of
you
here
i
assured
her
and
probably
our
fuss
about
bedr
is
much
ado
about
nothing
we
have
no
evidence
the
man
who
stared
at
me
over
his
candle
has
a
scar
on
his
forehead
said
biddy
maybe
he
got
it
in
that
row
in
front
of
the
house
of
the
crocodile
maybe
he
is
burke
and
has
just
come
out
of
the
hospital
most
likely
he
is
schmidt
and
adorned
himself
with
the
wound
in
a
student
duel
said
i
it
too
he
must
be
over
thirty
she
objected
but
at
that
moment
miss
loomed
into
sight
and
in
the
stuffy
atmosphere
of
the
tomb
felt
the
need
of
my
arm
to
keep
her
from
fainting
we
did
the
pyramid
of
unas
dilapidated
without
secretively
beautiful
within
we
went
from
tomb
to
tomb
lingering
long
in
the
labyrinthine
mansion
of
mereruka
who
ruddy
and
large
as
life
stepped
hospitably
down
in
from
his
stela
recess
to
welcome
us
in
the
name
of
himself
and
wife
almost
he
seemed
to
wave
his
hands
and
say
look
at
these
nice
pictures
of
me
and
my
family
and
our
ways
of
life
painted
on
the
walls
our
servants
our
dwarfs
our
mountebanks
and
acrobats
our
flocks
and
herds
sorry
there
no
refreshment
at
present
on
my
alabaster
mastaba
or
table
of
offerings
but
you
see
i
did
prepare
for
visitors
outside
my
own
immediate
circle
of
ka
and
ba
still
as
you
come
make
yourselves
at
home
and
take
pot
luck
i
think
when
you
examined
everything
you
admit
that
you
have
a
in
europe
to
touch
mine
which
if
i
do
say
it
is
the
best
thing
this
side
of
thebes
next
came
the
tomb
of
thi
but
by
this
time
mural
representations
of
fish
flesh
and
fruit
began
to
be
aggravating
it
would
be
past
two
before
we
could
reach
our
and
somehow
it
seemed
less
desirable
to
feed
after
than
before
that
sacred
hour
though
the
custom
be
sanctioned
by
royalty
another
tomb
to
see
before
lunch
groaned
sir
john
biddell
when
the
dragoman
firmly
insisted
on
the
apis
mausoleum
oh
darn
we
what
where
they
buried
as
soon
see
a
slaughter
house
on
an
empty
stomach
lady
biddell
and
i
will
go
sit
in
the
shadow
of
our
camels
and
they
did
nor
would
they
believe
the
twins
assertions
that
the
dark
mausoleum
with
its
cavernous
rock
chambers
and
granite
vaults
was
the
most
impressive
thing
they
had
seen
in
egypt
you
say
that
to
be
aggravating
because
we
were
there
i
heard
lady
biddell
snap
over
the
grumbling
of
the
camels
the
sky
blazed
down
and
the
sand
blazed
up
the
desert
was
with
a
silver
whiteness
hotter
than
gold
and
the
foreshortened
shadows
were
turquoise
blue
it
was
heaven
to
arrive
at
a
miniature
oasis
and
see
the
awninged
reflected
with
its
green
frame
of
palms
in
a
clear
lagoon
thoughtfully
left
by
the
receding
nile
at
sight
of
this
picture
my
popularity
went
up
with
a
bound
it
really
was
a
lovely
vision
the
big
tent
lined
with
egyptian
appliqué
work
in
many
colors
the
porchlike
roof
extension
supported
by
poles
and
in
its
shadow
a
white
table
loaded
with
good
things
and
guarded
by
arab
waiters
waving
beaded
as
we
lingered
over
our
fruit
and
cool
drinks
and
lazily
watched
our
camels
munching
bersím
all
our
first
enthusiasm
for
these
interesting
beasts
streamed
back
the
ladies
called
them
poor
dears
and
sweet
things
and
the
men
marvelled
at
their
calm
endurance
or
the
number
of
their
monny
was
gay
and
charming
and
looked
at
me
so
kindly
that
i
thought
she
must
mean
to
give
a
favorable
answer
to
the
buried
letter
i
blessed
cleopatra
for
the
tip
she
had
given
though
i
wondered
what
was
the
humiliation
from
which
i
could
save
her
niece
after
all
said
i
the
desert
trip
going
to
pan
out
a
success
but
it
must
have
been
about
this
time
that
the
wind
rose
it
blew
miss
hat
up
instead
of
down
and
other
hats
off
when
we
had
started
again
and
it
blew
into
our
eyes
grains
of
sand
as
large
as
able
bodied
also
as
we
passed
through
a
picturesque
which
ought
to
have
pleased
everybody
it
blew
into
our
noses
smells
which
lady
biddell
knew
would
give
us
plague
as
if
this
were
not
enough
the
sandcart
nearly
turned
over
in
a
rut
and
miss
said
that
she
must
go
home
or
be
left
to
die
in
the
desert
i
had
to
lead
the
little
stallion
before
she
would
consent
to
go
on
and
realized
when
i
had
ploughed
through
fifty
yards
of
sand
that
the
manicured
snob
of
a
leader
was
a
thin
brown
hero
by
the
time
i
had
had
a
mile
or
two
of
this
the
dark
pyramids
of
dahshur
were
visible
and
i
knew
that
our
camp
was
to
be
pitched
not
far
beyond
my
first
emotion
was
pleasure
my
second
panic
what
if
slaney
had
forgotten
his
promise
to
remove
the
cook
labels
since
remounting
farag
only
the
coastguard
camels
had
names
the
smelt
as
sweet
without
monny
and
i
had
been
bumping
along
side
by
side
and
she
had
just
said
if
i
tell
you
something
you
never
breathe
it
to
a
soul
will
you
when
i
saw
those
pyramids
and
was
smitten
with
the
fear
of
cook
never
i
vowed
torn
between
the
desire
to
hear
her
secret
and
to
dash
ahead
of
the
caravan
into
camp
it
about
monny
went
on
you
know
i
said
to
you
the
other
night
that
perhaps
i
knew
something
about
him
yes
er
oh
yes
we
were
within
a
few
hundred
yards
of
the
pyramids
now
at
any
instant
the
camp
might
burst
into
sight
you
do
look
interested
but
i
am
awfully
you
you
wo
tell
sure
was
that
a
flag
fluttering
on
the
horizon
well
then
it
is
business
of
course
but
one
ca
help
being
interested
in
him
he
such
a
such
a
romantic
sort
of
figure
as
you
said
yourself
and
there
something
so
high
and
noble
about
him
i
mean
about
his
looks
and
manners
that
one
hates
to
be
disappointed
you
have
him
with
us
you
know
i
know
and
and
i
glad
i
we
got
him
it
a
it
an
experience
i
suppose
he
rather
wonderful
but
do
you
think
he
ought
to
remember
that
he
is
a
prince
he
is
even
called
bey
and
if
he
were
its
not
the
same
as
being
a
prince
of
ancient
egypt
in
what
way
has
he
presumed
on
his
er
near
princehood
i
believe
he
has
fallen
in
love
with
biddy
by
jove
the
flag
flutter
what
flag
oh
er
that
was
only
an
expression
they
use
it
where
i
live
why
should
he
fall
in
love
with
biddy
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
he
of
a
darker
race
though
he
does
seem
so
like
of
course
she
could
marry
him
it
would
do
it
i
do
know
i
must
think
it
over
is
that
all
you
were
going
to
tell
me
no
i
suppose
it
natural
he
should
fall
in
love
with
biddy
attractive
but
the
worst
part
about
it
is
that
he
has
to
aunt
clara
not
possible
yes
he
has
i
saw
part
of
the
letter
the
first
part
she
the
only
one
of
us
who
thinks
it
would
be
right
to
marry
a
man
of
egyptian
blood
because
you
know
she
believes
she
egyptian
herself
and
always
talking
about
reincarnations
do
see
that
it
such
a
wonderful
coincidence
his
name
being
it
would
be
so
bad
if
he
were
in
love
with
her
but
it
biddy
who
is
always
right
in
everything
she
says
and
does
according
to
him
just
as
i
am
always
wrong
aunt
clara
is
richer
than
biddy
i
ca
bear
to
fancy
why
he
has
proposed
it
would
take
away
all
the
romance
do
strip
him
of
his
romance
yet
said
i
again
torn
between
interest
in
monny
incredible
statement
and
excitement
which
grew
with
the
growing
in
size
of
those
flags
on
the
horizon
you
may
wrong
him
if
you
saw
only
the
part
of
the
letter
there
could
be
no
mistake
it
was
in
hieroglyphics
and
who
but
would
have
written
such
a
letter
to
aunt
clara
she
asked
me
to
translate
it
the
night
she
dug
it
up
at
fustât
dug
and
when
i
read
as
far
as
queen
star
of
my
heart
be
my
wife
she
snatched
the
paper
away
and
put
it
inside
her
dress
saying
she
look
up
the
rest
in
one
of
my
books
good
heavens
you
must
have
changed
places
at
fustât
that
letter
could
have
been
for
her
it
could
have
been
for
any
one
else
queen
meant
queen
cleopatra
she
said
so
herself
i
do
know
what
she
going
to
do
about
it
do
about
it
i
echoed
desperately
why
and
just
then
my
straining
eyes
saw
that
on
the
middle
flag
in
the
fluttering
row
were
four
large
red
letters
on
a
white
ground
slaney
had
betrayed
me
everything
depended
on
getting
that
flag
down
before
those
letters
declared
themselves
to
other
eyes
excuse
me
i
finished
my
sentence
with
a
gasp
monny
must
have
gasped
also
as
she
saw
me
suddenly
dash
away
from
her
at
full
speed
of
power
but
i
had
no
time
to
think
about
what
she
might
think
i
suppose
i
must
have
done
something
to
the
of
that
camel
which
coastguard
camels
do
not
permit
whatever
it
was
it
got
me
into
the
midst
of
camp
before
i
could
draw
breath
but
i
have
a
dim
recollection
of
being
caught
by
arab
arms
and
seeing
suppressed
arab
grins
as
mechanically
i
felt
to
see
how
far
the
end
of
my
spine
stuck
out
at
the
top
of
my
head
that
flag
pull
it
down
was
my
first
gasp
pointing
convulsively
to
the
banner
which
shrieked
cook
quick
before
they
come
dazed
by
my
vehemence
several
arabs
scuttled
to
obey
the
order
but
there
were
too
many
of
them
each
hindered
his
neighbour
and
as
i
danced
about
making
matters
worse
out
pounced
our
withered
chêf
from
the
it
was
brought
that
flag
wrapped
round
something
explained
one
of
the
men
in
arabic
when
he
saw
we
had
other
flags
but
none
of
cook
he
gave
it
to
us
to
put
over
the
biggest
tent
because
he
thought
it
shameful
to
have
no
flag
of
the
master
cook
is
the
master
i
it
i
burbled
with
a
leap
to
catch
the
square
of
white
as
it
reluctantly
came
down
but
i
was
too
late
sir
john
biddell
and
harry
snell
the
newspaper
man
came
gallumping
up
on
their
camels
before
i
could
stuff
the
flag
into
my
pocket
what
the
matter
they
asked
as
their
animals
squatted
to
let
them
down
were
you
run
away
with
what
are
you
so
mad
about
hullo
what
flag
that
it
should
be
over
the
i
heard
myself
explaining
you
see
it
the
cook
special
flag
he
brought
it
himself
but
these
chaps
went
and
flew
it
over
the
in
place
of
the
union
jack
that
why
he
and
i
are
mad
and
i
thanked
all
the
stars
on
monny
tent
flag
that
none
of
the
set
understood
arabic
after
this
how
could
i
hope
to
explain
to
monny
that
the
hieroglyphic
proposal
was
mine
and
that
she
not
cleopatra
ought
to
have
dug
it
up
she
is
a
girl
used
to
having
men
run
away
from
her
on
camelback
or
anything
else
so
naturally
she
thought
me
a
rude
beast
and
showed
it
besides
even
if
i
dared
i
should
have
had
no
chance
to
straighten
matters
out
for
though
the
was
after
all
no
fault
of
slaney
there
were
a
few
little
things
which
had
escaped
even
his
napoleonic
memory
and
it
was
only
by
combining
the
feats
of
an
acrobat
with
those
of
a
juggler
that
i
saved
my
reputation
during
the
next
half
hour
no
sight
could
have
been
more
beautiful
in
our
eyes
than
that
village
of
white
tents
in
the
waste
of
yellow
sand
our
wildest
imaginings
could
have
pictured
nothing
more
perfect
more
peaceful
tea
was
ready
in
the
huge
where
folding
chairs
were
grouped
round
a
table
the
floor
of
sand
was
hidden
with
thick
rugs
and
it
was
finding
and
son
on
the
wrong
side
of
one
which
miss
foot
turned
up
that
filled
me
with
renewed
alarms
hastily
i
laid
the
rug
straight
placed
a
chair
upon
it
and
persuaded
everybody
to
have
tea
before
inspecting
their
bedroom
tents
while
they
drank
draughts
and
dabbed
jam
on
an
egyptian
conception
of
scones
i
hurried
like
a
haggard
ghost
from
tent
to
tent
seeking
the
forbidden
thing
cook
on
the
backs
of
the
little
mirrors
hanging
from
the
pole
hooks
will
it
wash
off
no
cut
it
out
with
a
penknife
down
on
your
knees
and
tear
off
the
label
from
the
wrong
side
of
another
carpet
memo
must
do
the
one
in
the
when
the
people
are
asleep
for
the
night
cram
three
cook
towels
into
my
pockets
hastily
pin
a
handkerchief
over
the
name
on
a
white
bit
of
a
tent
wall
must
have
it
cut
out
and
patched
with
something
later
shall
have
to
pay
damages
when
i
settle
up
with
slaney
lady
macbeth
was
in
it
with
me
all
she
needed
was
a
little
water
i
have
to
have
pins
and
penknives
and
pockets
all
over
the
place
i
did
get
any
tea
but
that
was
a
detail
and
everybody
was
so
delighted
with
everything
that
my
spirits
rose
despite
a
snub
or
two
from
monny
for
which
biddy
tried
to
make
up
people
took
desert
strolls
or
sat
on
dunes
and
gazed
into
the
sunset
which
could
have
been
better
if
i
had
turned
it
on
myself
along
the
western
horizon
ran
a
pale
flame
of
green
blending
with
rose
rose
blending
with
amethyst
and
in
the
distance
the
pyramids
of
dahshur
burned
with
the
red
of
rubies
the
wind
had
died
among
the
desert
dunes
and
it
was
not
till
after
dinner
that
any
one
realized
the
arctic
fall
of
temperature
it
was
too
cold
to
enjoy
playing
bridge
or
any
of
the
games
i
had
brought
and
the
only
hope
of
comfort
was
in
bed
people
said
good
night
to
each
other
in
the
comparatively
warm
and
then
gave
surprised
shrieks
or
grunts
according
to
sex
at
the
piercing
cold
several
of
the
elder
ladies
fell
over
despite
the
large
lanterns
illuminating
the
desert
and
had
to
be
escorted
to
their
bedroom
tents
and
soothed
after
this
silence
reigned
for
a
few
minutes
and
i
had
stealthily
begun
to
work
on
the
biggest
when
arose
a
clamour
of
voices
and
presently
appeared
the
dragoman
lent
by
slaney
eight
ladies
wishing
bottles
he
explained
but
there
were
no
bottles
we
had
thought
of
everything
it
seemed
except
bottles
i
tell
them
very
sorry
but
ca
have
yusef
suggested
looking
pleased
let
me
think
i
groaned
what
about
the
mineral
water
bottles
we
emptied
at
lunch
and
dinner
let
the
cook
boil
water
and
we
supply
the
bottles
this
was
done
and
i
was
proud
of
the
inspiration
with
the
pride
that
comes
before
a
fall
when
i
began
to
write
in
my
bedroom
tent
wrapped
in
all
the
blankets
of
the
bed
that
should
be
anthony
i
had
the
place
to
myself
but
about
midnight
a
head
was
unexpectedly
thrust
through
the
it
looked
ghostly
in
the
haze
of
colour
made
by
the
gorgeous
appliqué
work
of
high
roof
and
octagon
walls
which
gave
an
effect
of
sitting
at
the
bottom
of
a
giant
kaleidoscope
who
that
i
hissed
in
a
whisper
meant
to
be
discreet
but
which
roused
a
camel
or
two
in
the
ring
outside
the
tents
biddell
sir
john
biddell
replied
the
head
i
saw
your
light
and
remembered
you
had
your
tent
to
yourself
those
bottles
have
been
leaking
there
one
at
least
gone
wrong
in
most
of
the
ladies
tents
the
married
men
have
given
their
beds
to
girls
who
are
drowned
out
was
idea
about
those
bottles
was
it
i
expect
you
hear
from
it
in
the
morning
three
of
us
want
to
come
and
camp
in
here
with
you
all
right
i
sighed
with
a
sinking
heart
i
sitting
up
and
you
can
toss
for
the
cots
at
this
moment
sir
john
biddell
reposes
in
one
of
them
general
harlow
in
the
other
these
gentlemen
were
so
affected
with
the
cold
that
they
went
to
bed
in
their
clothes
then
got
up
to
put
on
their
overcoats
then
got
up
again
and
put
on
their
hats
on
the
floor
lies
a
certain
mills
of
manchester
rolled
in
all
the
rugs
except
one
which
i
have
on
after
surrendering
my
blankets
he
has
his
head
in
a
basket
to
keep
off
the
icy
draught
and
in
the
ruggy
region
of
his
spine
as
he
rests
on
his
side
are
the
letters
i
wonder
if
i
could
rip
them
off
without
waking
him
up
chapter
xv
the
desert
diary
to
its
bitter
end
the
principal
has
leaked
consequently
not
enough
water
to
go
round
chêf
said
it
was
a
question
of
baths
or
soup
considering
the
cold
most
of
the
people
voted
for
soup
some
washed
in
apollinaris
others
douched
with
soda
siphons
we
can
get
more
water
ca
think
why
the
north
wind
does
stop
and
warm
itself
while
traversing
the
mediterranean
or
the
hot
sands
it
seems
to
be
in
too
fierce
a
hurry
and
consequently
cuts
across
the
desert
like
a
frozen
scythe
the
moment
its
rival
the
sun
has
gone
to
sleep
i
hear
that
miss
cried
with
cold
as
she
dressed
and
put
on
two
of
everything
but
she
is
luckier
than
the
younger
women
monny
and
east
though
warned
that
nights
would
be
chill
have
come
clothed
in
silk
and
gossamer
and
have
brought
nightgowns
of
nainsook
trimmed
with
lace
this
was
confided
to
me
soon
after
sunrise
by
a
biddy
hovering
over
the
kitchen
fire
and
incidentally
ingratiating
herself
with
the
cook
it
would
be
biddy
if
she
were
ingratiating
herself
with
some
one
nobody
yearned
to
get
up
early
i
speak
for
others
as
passed
my
night
in
the
attitude
of
a
suspension
bridge
between
two
folding
chairs
but
in
camp
where
sleep
is
concerned
men
may
propose
camels
dispose
their
nights
they
spend
in
a
ring
of
camelhood
huddled
together
for
warmth
and
if
they
do
not
have
nightmare
or
bite
each
other
in
their
sleep
mere
humans
in
neighbouring
tents
may
hope
for
comparative
silence
in
the
desert
if
not
near
a
village
full
of
at
sunrise
however
a
change
comes
their
spirit
they
are
given
food
and
made
as
happy
and
contented
as
it
is
their
nature
to
be
which
apparently
is
not
saying
much
judging
by
the
strange
inarticulate
oaths
they
constantly
mutter
they
are
equally
accursed
in
their
sitting
down
and
their
getting
up
it
is
only
when
they
are
actually
on
the
move
floating
and
swaying
through
the
air
legs
tail
neck
jaws
that
they
have
nothing
disagreeable
to
say
immediately
after
dawn
this
morning
our
camels
began
to
imitate
every
animal
they
could
have
met
since
the
days
of
the
ark
when
one
had
to
know
everybody
they
mewed
like
cats
hissed
like
snakes
bleated
like
sheep
roared
like
toy
lions
grunted
like
pigs
barked
like
dogs
squawked
like
geese
and
bellowed
like
baby
bulls
also
they
gargled
their
throats
like
elderly
invalids
it
was
useless
trying
to
sleep
and
when
i
had
accomplished
such
bathing
as
the
chêf
permitted
i
went
out
to
see
what
was
the
matter
nothing
was
the
matter
except
that
the
creatures
had
the
sunrise
in
their
eyes
and
could
see
the
preparing
their
loads
but
i
was
glad
i
had
come
out
because
biddy
was
there
and
the
scene
was
beautiful
shivering
we
chuckled
over
the
morning
toilet
of
the
camels
who
turned
their
faces
disconcertingly
upon
us
sneering
with
long
yellow
teeth
and
bubbling
as
if
their
mouths
were
full
of
pink
soapsuds
when
they
realized
that
we
were
laughing
at
them
incidentally
we
learned
why
the
baby
sphinx
accompanied
our
caravan
uninvited
his
name
is
salih
and
he
came
because
there
a
very
important
camel
the
property
of
his
father
who
refuses
to
eat
or
stir
without
him
it
is
a
most
original
and
elaborate
camel
it
has
a
neat
way
of
turning
its
ears
with
their
backs
to
the
wind
in
order
to
make
them
if
any
person
other
than
salih
touches
it
an
incredible
quantity
of
green
cud
is
instantly
let
loose
over
their
turbans
but
at
the
approach
of
salih
it
emits
a
purring
noise
preens
its
head
for
the
ornamented
with
a
bunch
of
palmlike
plumes
and
playfully
pretends
not
to
want
the
bersím
which
the
little
black
sphinx
thrusts
down
its
throat
in
handfuls
this
it
seems
is
good
camel
and
it
is
to
the
tail
of
this
animal
that
salih
clings
on
the
march
if
he
is
not
there
the
animal
looks
round
stops
or
turns
to
charge
at
any
arab
who
jestingly
misuses
its
idol
yesterday
the
miniature
sphinx
was
in
a
white
robe
he
is
in
black
all
the
arabs
have
changed
their
clothes
although
they
have
brought
no
visible
luggage
except
vague
pieces
of
sacking
the
dragoman
is
exquisitely
arrayed
galabeah
and
kaftan
with
a
pink
petticoat
and
a
white
one
under
that
i
suspect
that
he
sleeps
beneath
the
and
the
other
arabs
among
the
kitchen
pots
yet
they
are
smarter
than
any
of
us
europeans
all
of
whom
have
a
frayed
air
this
i
suppose
would
not
be
so
in
nothing
would
be
said
about
bottles
leaking
or
beetles
beetling
one
come
to
egypt
to
see
live
scarabs
or
draughts
raging
or
camels
gobbling
or
flags
flapping
all
night
memo
abolish
flags
even
at
expense
of
patriotism
despite
every
desert
drawback
however
biddy
and
i
agreed
that
the
sunrise
alone
was
worth
the
journey
and
the
pure
air
of
dawn
which
though
cold
seemed
perfumed
by
mysterious
just
at
the
desert
was
lily
pale
then
as
the
horizon
flamed
a
dazzling
flood
of
gold
poured
over
the
dunes
the
sun
was
a
fantastic
brooch
of
beaten
copper
caught
in
a
veil
of
ruby
gauze
while
here
and
there
a
belated
star
was
a
dull
flawed
emerald
sewn
into
the
veil
fringe
shadows
swept
westward
across
the
desert
like
blue
water
showing
a
glitter
of
drowned
jewels
underneath
and
though
last
night
it
had
seemed
that
we
were
alone
in
a
vast
wilderness
now
there
were
signs
that
a
village
lay
not
far
off
a
group
of
children
in
red
and
blue
staring
avidly
at
the
camp
were
like
a
bunch
of
ragged
poppies
in
the
sand
their
mangy
had
ventured
nearer
to
smell
sadly
at
the
hanging
outside
our
a
with
splendid
eyes
and
a
blue
tattooed
chin
breakfasted
on
an
adjacent
dune
with
her
husband
men
like
living
hencoops
passed
in
the
distance
patriarchal
persons
blew
by
in
that
graceful
way
in
which
people
do
blow
in
egypt
driving
a
flock
of
sheep
with
a
black
lamb
for
luck
these
men
were
dressed
as
their
ancestors
had
dressed
in
the
time
of
abraham
and
biddy
and
i
envied
them
how
nice
said
she
to
wear
the
same
clothes
for
a
hundred
years
if
you
happened
to
live
and
never
be
out
of
fashion
if
a
few
of
your
things
dropped
off
by
degrees
you
were
still
all
right
and
nobody
would
be
rude
enough
to
notice
our
faded
family
revived
after
breakfast
and
even
those
who
vowed
they
had
closed
an
eye
all
night
enjoyed
the
scene
of
striking
camp
the
big
white
tents
fell
to
the
ground
like
pricked
whereupon
their
remains
were
deftly
rolled
up
and
tied
on
to
the
backs
of
bitterly
protesting
camels
beds
mattresses
tables
chairs
ceased
to
be
what
they
had
been
and
became
something
else
camels
made
faces
and
noises
arabs
tore
this
way
and
that
doing
as
little
work
as
possible
the
cook
fluttered
about
in
his
blanket
brandishing
a
saucepan
yusef
the
dragoman
made
noble
gestures
of
command
and
our
little
desert
city
ceased
to
exist
except
on
camels
backs
it
was
shaved
off
the
surface
of
the
earth
and
went
churning
and
swaying
along
toward
the
next
stand
the
procession
rising
and
falling
among
swelling
dunes
under
a
sky
which
seemed
to
trail
like
a
heavy
blue
curtain
where
at
the
horizon
it
met
the
gold
we
travelled
over
pebbly
plateaus
scattered
with
stones
rose
out
of
the
glistening
plain
here
and
there
were
rocks
like
partly
hewn
sphinxes
pushing
out
of
the
sand
to
breathe
other
rocks
like
monstrous
toads
and
still
others
dark
and
dreadful
in
the
distance
as
ogres
houses
altogether
the
desert
gave
us
a
truly
libyan
effect
which
made
the
set
feel
that
after
all
they
were
getting
what
they
had
paid
for
with
an
introduction
to
a
beauty
and
heiress
thrown
in
but
apropos
of
this
latter
boon
it
is
dawning
upon
me
that
rachel
guest
is
receiving
more
attention
than
monny
this
strikes
me
as
inexplicable
there
are
more
men
than
women
in
our
party
all
young
except
sir
john
biddell
general
harlow
and
mills
of
manchester
a
soft
fat
sort
of
fellow
whose
first
name
you
can
never
remember
it
occurred
to
me
on
starting
that
the
desire
of
so
many
unattached
young
men
to
spend
a
week
in
the
desert
and
the
fayoum
might
not
be
unconnected
with
miss
gilder
intention
to
join
the
party
not
being
jealous
i
expected
to
see
a
little
fun
and
laugh
over
it
with
biddy
who
is
a
heavenly
person
with
whom
to
share
a
joke
but
if
there
is
a
joke
i
have
seen
the
point
yet
nor
has
she
there
no
disputing
the
fact
that
miss
guest
the
poor
brave
school
teacher
on
holiday
is
the
belle
of
the
desert
of
course
if
monny
had
stopped
in
cairo
rachel
success
with
our
men
would
be
astonishing
as
brigit
and
monny
warned
me
in
their
letters
to
the
she
grows
better
looking
every
day
but
though
she
is
distinctly
of
monny
type
despite
those
slanting
eyes
she
will
never
be
a
real
beauty
or
a
complete
fascinator
like
our
gilded
girl
besides
monny
has
millions
and
rachel
has
a
cent
yet
there
it
is
miss
guest
is
having
the
time
of
her
life
in
spite
of
leaky
water
bottles
and
bumping
camels
while
miss
gilder
might
be
an
old
married
woman
for
all
the
attention
she
gets
from
any
man
on
this
trip
except
me
what
can
be
the
explanation
even
those
two
exaggerately
men
with
bedr
stared
at
rachel
from
their
respectful
distance
it
turns
out
that
they
camped
not
far
from
us
last
night
yusef
heard
this
from
one
of
our
but
they
kept
to
themselves
and
did
come
within
a
mile
of
us
so
there
nothing
to
complain
of
every
one
except
sir
john
delighted
with
desert
he
ca
see
anything
beautiful
in
yellow
lumps
that
keep
you
sawing
up
and
down
though
he
has
no
doubt
the
desert
is
full
of
other
fools
doing
what
we
doing
and
we
could
all
see
each
other
doing
it
if
it
were
for
those
darn
dunes
adventure
for
sandcart
on
one
of
the
biggest
plateaus
looked
all
right
from
the
top
but
a
shriek
from
east
put
me
to
the
dire
necessity
of
sliding
off
farag
and
running
to
the
rescue
the
plateau
was
broken
off
in
front
and
became
a
precipice
which
cleopatra
seemed
to
think
would
not
have
existed
had
antoun
arrived
in
tune
to
arrange
it
great
wind
came
roaring
up
again
about
noon
feared
to
learn
that
it
had
been
impossible
to
get
in
position
but
when
the
time
came
to
find
it
there
it
was
with
its
back
to
the
blast
and
its
shady
open
front
of
appliqué
offering
the
picture
of
white
table
and
smiling
brown
waiters
while
we
lunched
the
fierce
gusts
striking
the
back
canvas
wall
were
like
the
frightened
flappings
of
giant
wings
and
the
beating
of
a
great
bird
heart
otherwise
we
might
have
forgotten
the
elements
as
we
ate
save
for
a
slight
powdering
of
sand
on
our
food
but
even
that
was
bad
if
we
selected
only
the
port
side
of
our
bread
and
chicken
leaving
windward
bits
to
the
arabs
our
night
camp
was
in
shelter
of
the
two
vast
dunes
which
hide
the
ancient
city
of
bacchias
now
called
where
we
found
antoun
awaiting
us
he
had
started
from
cairo
in
the
morning
on
a
coastguard
camel
coming
quickly
along
the
camel
route
between
bedrashen
and
tomieh
and
the
extra
few
miles
to
our
encampment
before
we
arrived
he
had
sent
the
camel
back
with
the
mounted
arab
who
accompanied
him
and
somehow
the
camp
seemed
all
the
smarter
and
more
for
the
presence
of
the
handsome
hadji
in
his
green
turban
the
set
are
all
extremely
interested
in
him
and
on
hearing
my
version
of
his
history
sketchily
told
have
taken
to
calling
him
the
prince
enid
and
elaine
almost
fawn
upon
him
in
their
admiration
of
so
romantic
and
splendid
an
addition
to
our
party
a
real
live
egyptian
gentleman
with
enough
european
blood
in
his
veins
to
justify
maidens
in
cherishing
a
hopeless
love
for
him
when
he
has
safely
vanished
out
of
their
lives
east
made
anthony
pick
up
oyster
shells
in
the
desert
between
flaming
sunset
and
twilight
when
the
sky
became
a
vast
blue
tent
hung
with
a
million
lamps
and
at
dinner
she
was
not
nice
to
enid
and
elaine
who
admired
her
hero
too
frankly
she
has
developed
an
embarrassing
clearness
of
vision
as
to
other
people
former
incarnations
especially
their
disagreeable
or
shocking
ones
ah
it
has
come
to
me
she
exclaimed
her
elbows
on
the
table
looking
dreamily
into
elaine
biddell
face
you
were
i
knew
seen
you
somewhere
as
for
enid
it
seems
that
she
was
charmian
or
iris
cleopatra
ca
be
sure
which
but
the
girl
has
come
to
me
saying
that
if
east
does
stop
calling
her
my
dear
handmaiden
one
or
the
other
of
them
will
have
to
give
up
starting
on
the
nile
trip
next
week
we
had
lobster
á
la
newburgh
for
dinner
in
desert
and
drank
the
chêf
health
in
champagne
i
do
know
which
was
to
blame
or
whether
it
was
the
combination
but
in
the
windy
middle
of
the
night
when
tent
flaps
stirred
like
a
nestful
of
young
birds
there
were
demands
for
ginger
and
for
peppermint
now
ginger
and
peppermint
happened
to
be
the
only
two
medicaments
in
the
whole
pharmacopoeia
left
out
of
the
medicine
chest
but
nothing
else
would
do
the
more
the
things
were
there
the
more
they
were
wanted
and
all
the
people
who
had
made
notes
to
remember
me
in
their
wills
scratched
me
out
again
then
to
pile
ossa
on
pelion
the
dogs
of
tomieh
arrived
to
pay
a
visit
they
barked
of
course
but
they
barked
so
much
that
the
noise
was
like
a
silence
and
nobody
minded
after
the
first
half
hour
the
worst
was
that
they
did
not
confine
their
demonstrations
to
barking
in
order
to
signify
their
disapproval
of
our
stingy
ways
they
took
the
boots
we
had
confided
to
the
sand
in
front
of
our
tents
to
be
cleaned
and
worried
them
at
a
considerable
distance
some
of
the
boots
were
past
wearing
when
found
and
some
were
not
found
judging
from
cold
glances
directed
at
me
by
those
obliged
to
resort
to
pumps
or
bedroom
slippers
one
would
imagine
me
the
trainer
of
this
canine
menagerie
it
has
been
hinted
too
that
a
conductor
worth
his
salt
would
have
filled
up
interstices
of
the
medicine
chest
with
toothbrushes
several
members
of
the
party
forgot
to
pack
theirs
in
moving
camp
and
they
are
now
the
property
of
jackals
a
stock
of
toothbrushes
is
the
one
other
thing
besides
peppermint
and
ginger
and
bottles
that
slaney
and
i
left
out
of
our
calculations
still
i
do
think
bygones
ought
to
be
bygones
anthony
is
the
hero
now
because
it
occurred
to
him
to
buy
in
cairo
flannelette
nightwear
male
and
female
of
the
thickest
and
most
hideously
pink
description
had
these
horrors
been
suggested
at
the
start
they
would
have
been
rejected
with
fury
in
favour
of
lace
and
nainsook
but
the
contribution
has
made
a
at
a
crisis
when
vanity
has
been
forgotten
and
the
girls
are
employing
their
prettiest
frocks
as
bed
covering
day
have
now
forgotten
which
or
how
many
we
had
this
is
anthony
hour
but
he
may
take
such
advantage
of
it
as
he
chooses
indifferent
on
top
of
my
troubles
i
contracted
desert
snivels
whether
the
habit
of
using
sand
for
snuff
has
produced
the
malady
or
whether
i
caught
something
despite
the
tonic
air
from
nomads
or
all
of
whom
emit
a
storm
of
coughs
and
sneezes
i
do
not
know
all
desire
to
use
this
grand
opportunity
of
taking
cleopatra
advice
and
winning
monny
love
while
for
once
neglected
by
others
has
died
within
me
my
one
wish
is
to
keep
away
from
her
and
the
rest
except
perhaps
biddy
and
suffer
alone
like
a
cat
biddy
has
got
desert
snivels
too
it
makes
another
link
between
us
like
the
memories
of
our
childhood
we
swop
stories
of
symptoms
both
feel
that
sense
of
terrible
resignation
which
desert
babies
have
when
their
eyes
are
full
of
flies
and
no
one
takes
them
out
the
sky
lowers
big
black
birds
flap
over
our
heads
like
pirate
flags
that
have
blown
away
they
are
the
vultures
which
used
to
be
sacred
to
egyptians
and
seem
to
labour
under
the
delusion
that
they
are
sacred
still
the
sand
blows
into
our
back
hair
and
the
arabs
make
scarves
and
veils
of
their
turbans
apparently
these
moslems
never
say
any
prayers
and
the
people
feel
they
been
cheated
of
a
promised
sensation
of
desert
life
the
only
religious
thing
the
men
do
is
to
bawl
allah
when
they
lift
the
heavy
rolled
up
tents
onto
the
camels
people
are
beginning
to
grumble
about
their
meals
which
at
first
seemed
to
them
miracles
of
culinary
art
same
old
desert
things
been
eating
ever
since
moses
i
heard
harry
snell
mutter
and
sir
john
biddell
is
sick
of
eggs
i
suppose
he
means
i
should
like
to
feed
him
on
scarabs
tea
is
the
only
incident
in
the
desert
which
has
palled
on
no
one
yet
very
jolly
having
finished
the
day
exertion
and
sitting
on
folding
chairs
inside
tent
door
teacup
in
hand
watching
the
winged
shadows
sweep
across
the
dunes
one
feels
like
jacob
or
rebecca
or
some
one
there
may
be
a
fine
saint
tomb
standing
up
against
the
of
a
sunset
sky
but
one
does
bother
to
walk
out
and
examine
it
at
close
quarters
there
nothing
like
sitting
still
after
a
windy
day
on
camel
back
we
lack
interest
in
history
ancient
and
modern
although
egypt
is
the
country
which
ought
to
make
one
want
to
know
all
other
history
there
may
be
a
european
war
or
an
earthquake
we
do
care
what
happens
to
any
one
but
ourselves
it
is
all
we
can
do
to
keep
track
of
our
own
affairs
as
for
ancient
history
we
content
ourselves
with
wondering
if
anthony
and
cleopatra
when
picnicking
in
the
desert
dropped
orange
peel
and
cake
to
feed
the
living
scarabs
of
their
day
we
seem
to
be
lost
to
the
world
yet
now
and
then
we
reminded
that
we
have
neighbours
in
the
desert
we
had
glimpses
of
a
distant
caravan
which
must
be
bedr
and
when
we
came
in
sight
of
our
own
camp
last
evening
we
were
just
in
time
to
catch
a
party
of
germans
being
photographed
in
front
of
it
with
our
things
for
an
unpaid
background
ever
beauteous
picture
by
the
by
your
own
encampment
white
tents
blossoming
like
snowy
flowers
in
a
wilderness
a
dense
black
cloud
massed
near
by
on
the
golden
sand
which
might
in
the
distance
be
a
plantation
of
young
palms
but
is
in
reality
a
congested
mass
of
camels
you
sing
at
the
top
of
your
voice
from
the
desert
i
come
to
thee
on
a
stallion
shod
with
fire
hoping
to
thrill
the
girls
but
they
are
thinking
about
their
tea
girls
in
the
desert
i
find
are
always
thinking
about
their
tea
or
their
dinner
or
their
beds
you
would
like
when
your
desert
snivels
improve
to
walk
with
a
maiden
under
the
stars
but
no
she
is
sleepy
she
wants
to
get
to
bed
early
even
the
camels
are
most
particular
about
their
bed
hours
it
would
be
irritating
if
you
did
secretly
feel
the
same
yourself
but
what
a
waste
of
stars
old
day
or
other
interesting
but
dusty
dyke
road
into
the
fayoum
oasis
every
one
enraged
with
robert
hichens
because
bella
donna
nigel
recommended
the
fayoum
no
wonder
she
poisoned
him
snarled
harlow
our
arabs
riding
ahead
look
magnificent
seeming
to
wade
through
a
flood
of
gold
the
feet
and
legs
of
their
camels
floating
in
a
mist
but
alas
the
flood
of
gold
and
the
mist
are
composed
of
dust
that
reddish
dust
in
which
presumably
the
boasted
fayoum
roses
grow
and
it
blows
into
our
noses
this
upsets
our
tempers
and
prevents
our
enjoying
the
pictures
we
see
in
the
sudden
transition
from
desert
to
oasis
biblical
patriarchs
on
white
asses
disputing
the
high
narrow
gisr
or
dyke
road
women
with
huge
gold
nose
rings
running
processions
of
girls
in
blowing
coral
and
copper
robes
large
ornamental
jars
on
their
veiled
heads
thin
trailing
black
scarves
and
slim
figures
dark
against
a
sky
of
gold
gamoushas
and
exaggerated
calves
with
boxlike
ears
in
which
you
feel
you
ought
to
post
something
canals
stretching
away
through
emerald
fields
to
distant
palm
groves
here
and
there
a
miniature
cataract
children
playing
in
the
water
imps
whose
red
and
amber
rags
ring
out
high
notes
of
colour
like
the
clash
of
cymbals
now
and
then
a
jerboa
or
a
mongoose
waddling
across
the
path
travelling
families
on
trotting
donkeys
or
swinging
camels
who
pass
us
with
difficulty
camels
everywhere
indeed
on
dyke
or
in
meadow
even
the
clouds
are
shaped
like
camels
who
have
gone
to
heaven
and
turned
to
mother
o
pearl
there
are
horses
too
not
little
sand
stallions
like
ours
but
ordinary
plodding
animals
whose
hoofs
know
only
fayoum
dust
or
mud
our
desert
creature
however
does
not
spurn
them
on
the
contrary
though
he
pretends
not
to
notice
camels
cows
or
buffaloes
he
whinnies
and
prances
with
delight
when
he
meets
anything
of
his
own
shape
and
assumes
attitudes
much
to
the
alarm
of
cleopatra
and
miss
also
just
to
remind
everybody
that
sand
is
his
element
he
shies
at
water
and
almost
swoons
at
sight
of
the
fayoum
light
railway
much
wind
again
but
thank
goodness
out
of
fayoum
dust
and
in
desert
sand
for
lunch
prop
up
tent
with
our
backs
leaning
against
the
blast
however
we
have
now
a
special
for
the
bread
and
a
moderately
clean
bandanna
for
the
fruit
plates
we
blow
upon
without
a
qualm
scarabei
gambolling
in
the
sand
around
our
feet
we
pass
unnoticed
this
is
the
simple
desert
life
but
ah
what
an
encampment
for
the
night
it
makes
up
for
everything
and
a
sudden
realization
of
abounding
health
is
tingling
in
our
veins
we
adore
the
desert
we
want
to
spend
our
lives
in
it
thank
goodness
we
have
two
nights
here
on
the
golden
shore
of
the
blue
birket
karun
all
that
left
of
lake
moeris
of
which
strabo
and
herodotus
raved
from
the
plateau
where
our
white
tents
cluster
the
glitter
of
water
in
the
desert
is
like
a
mirage
a
mysterious
melancholy
sheet
of
steel
and
silver
turning
to
ruby
in
the
sunset
with
dark
birds
skimming
over
the
clear
surface
suddenly
the
bible
seems
as
exciting
as
some
wonderful
novel
not
far
from
here
ran
joseph
river
making
the
desert
to
blossom
like
the
rose
in
tents
like
ours
perhaps
abraham
rested
with
sarah
planning
how
to
save
himself
by
giving
her
to
the
egyptian
king
to
see
this
lake
is
like
seeing
a
bright
living
eye
suddenly
open
in
the
face
of
a
mummy
dead
for
six
thousand
years
our
best
sunset
romance
but
slightly
damaged
by
an
arab
waiter
wrapping
up
his
head
in
a
towel
with
which
he
had
just
dried
our
teacups
and
no
doubt
will
again
day
merely
slavish
to
look
it
out
in
the
calendar
and
besides
there
is
none
all
i
know
is
we
had
two
on
the
shore
of
birket
kurun
i
spell
it
a
different
way
now
because
no
books
ever
spell
anything
in
egypt
twice
alike
the
lake
of
the
horns
and
we
been
on
the
water
in
some
very
old
boats
in
order
to
see
things
which
may
have
existed
once
but
do
now
and
at
present
encamped
near
a
kind
of
lesser
cairo
originally
named
fâris
city
of
the
horseman
because
of
a
roman
equestrian
statue
found
in
the
neighbouring
mounds
of
crocodilopolis
we
have
just
arrived
hot
and
dusty
with
more
dust
of
more
fayoum
than
we
had
before
lake
moeris
fayoum
means
country
of
the
lake
it
seems
and
it
really
is
a
great
emerald
cup
sunk
below
the
level
of
the
nile
as
if
to
dip
up
water
for
its
roses
however
the
set
is
happy
despite
the
state
of
its
clothes
and
its
hair
none
of
us
quite
realized
what
the
fallahcen
were
really
like
before
or
that
the
word
fellal
meant
ploughman
this
has
been
and
we
met
an
endless
stream
of
riding
men
and
walking
women
with
black
trailing
garments
they
had
bought
sheep
and
goats
and
rabbits
and
quantities
of
rustling
pale
green
sugar
cane
which
they
carried
on
their
shoulders
there
were
wild
adventures
for
the
sandcart
and
watery
spaces
across
which
cleopatra
was
carried
at
her
own
urgent
request
by
anthony
miss
by
me
and
the
strongest
arab
there
were
the
wonderfully
picturesque
squalid
mud
towns
of
senoures
and
two
or
three
others
in
a
green
mist
of
palms
against
an
indigo
sky
with
streaks
of
sunshine
like
bright
bayonets
of
djinns
and
then
medinet
through
which
our
caravan
had
to
pass
to
camp
much
to
the
ribald
joy
of
smart
egyptian
undergrads
who
strolled
hand
in
hand
along
the
broad
streets
near
the
university
they
were
big
fantastic
houses
to
suit
modern
oriental
taste
painted
pink
and
green
and
set
in
shady
gardens
and
between
high
brick
embankments
we
saw
the
river
joseph
made
swiftly
running
deep
golden
yellow
like
the
nile
with
ancient
pouring
crystal
jets
into
enormous
troughs
this
was
our
most
fatiguing
day
and
we
wanted
our
last
encampment
to
be
the
best
we
found
the
worst
a
suburban
meadow
inhabited
by
goats
and
buffaloes
ca
we
move
somewhere
else
cleopatra
besought
anthony
to
whom
she
appeals
when
he
within
appealing
distance
is
this
tour
for
our
and
ca
we
do
what
we
anthony
absolved
the
explaining
that
we
must
be
near
the
town
in
order
to
get
carriages
and
see
the
sights
we
had
come
to
see
also
our
water
supply
had
given
out
and
we
must
beg
some
from
the
government
people
he
hinted
that
it
would
be
well
to
make
the
best
of
things
but
cleopatra
with
her
royal
memories
is
not
good
at
making
the
best
of
what
she
does
like
she
wants
what
she
wants
especially
in
her
own
egypt
where
things
ought
to
know
that
they
once
belonged
to
her
miss
is
quite
as
in
a
different
way
more
biblical
less
pagan
her
criticism
on
the
encampment
was
that
it
and
all
her
oasis
experiences
are
destroying
her
faith
in
hymns
by
cool
siloam
shady
rill
for
instance
used
to
be
her
favourite
but
she
does
believe
now
that
siloam
ever
had
a
rill
fallahcen
and
fellahah
does
sound
female
but
is
pretended
to
have
things
to
do
on
the
frontier
of
their
field
and
ours
as
we
were
settling
in
and
stared
unblinkingly
at
us
whenever
we
stuck
a
nose
outside
a
tent
also
they
laughed
also
they
brought
their
dogs
but
they
could
spoil
the
sunset
and
medinet
was
a
colourful
picture
of
the
orient
towering
against
the
crimson
west
i
took
monny
and
biddy
into
the
town
to
see
the
bridge
and
dilapidated
mosque
of
kait
bey
with
its
pillars
stolen
from
arsinoë
anthony
took
cleopatra
and
most
of
the
other
unmarried
men
took
rachel
guest
when
brigit
remarked
rather
sharply
upon
the
teacher
popularity
monny
laughed
an
odd
understanding
little
laugh
i
believe
you
think
you
know
they
all
so
mad
about
that
girl
exclaimed
biddy
perhaps
i
do
smiled
miss
gilder
is
her
fascination
bedr
could
have
told
you
monny
cryptically
replied
he
told
several
people
what
do
you
mean
child
i
eating
my
heart
out
to
know
do
eat
it
dearest
you
ca
eat
your
heart
and
have
it
too
and
it
your
most
important
possession
i
wish
you
would
tease
me
when
i
tired
is
it
part
of
the
secret
you
and
rachel
were
always
giggling
over
when
we
first
got
to
cairo
yes
dear
it
is
if
you
must
know
but
i
do
want
to
tell
even
you
what
the
secret
is
please
you
might
think
it
your
duty
to
spoil
rachel
fun
and
she
and
i
are
both
enjoying
it
much
can
you
guess
what
she
means
duffer
biddy
appealed
to
me
you
know
i
wrote
you
that
monny
and
miss
guest
had
a
secret
i
thought
afterward
it
might
have
been
only
their
plan
to
see
the
hasheesh
den
but
since
then
i
realized
it
was
something
else
even
if
i
could
guess
ought
i
to
give
miss
gilder
away
when
she
has
just
told
you
she
does
want
you
to
know
i
asked
innocently
they
both
turned
on
me
in
a
flash
i
expected
that
you
guess
i
do
see
if
i
do
why
i
should
have
little
secret
i
mildly
replied
i
knew
that
after
this
monny
would
give
me
a
good
deal
of
her
society
even
though
she
might
not
have
forgiven
me
for
bolting
to
haul
down
the
cook
ensign
in
the
midst
of
her
confidences
but
in
truth
i
have
not
guessed
the
secret
my
wits
go
wheeling
round
it
like
screaming
swallows
who
see
a
crumb
i
get
a
glimpse
of
the
crumb
and
lose
it
again
in
my
present
mood
i
almost
regret
that
bedr
and
his
supposed
germans
have
not
dumped
themselves
down
in
our
field
it
would
have
been
like
them
to
do
so
judging
by
the
aggressive
checks
on
those
mustard
tweeds
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
party
has
disappeared
from
view
since
just
before
birket
karun
they
may
have
turned
back
to
cairo
they
may
have
been
swallowed
up
by
a
palsied
sand
dune
they
may
have
been
eaten
by
jackals
we
saw
a
dead
one
or
they
may
have
taken
to
the
fleshpots
of
a
greek
hotel
in
medinet
but
the
fact
remains
that
just
when
he
might
be
useful
bedr
is
not
to
be
had
in
our
tent
i
took
advantage
of
our
friendship
to
try
and
draw
fenton
out
a
little
on
the
subject
of
his
feelings
it
seemed
the
right
hour
to
open
the
door
of
the
soul
the
fallaheen
having
taken
their
families
home
our
were
up
and
only
the
stars
looked
in
stars
swarming
like
fireflies
in
the
blue
cup
of
a
hanging
flower
but
anthony
would
speak
of
nothing
more
intimate
than
the
mountain
of
the
golden
pyramid
or
his
tiresome
sheikh
tomb
i
yearned
to
tell
him
of
the
about
the
hieroglyphic
letter
but
something
stopped
the
confession
on
the
end
of
my
tongue
though
perhaps
in
the
circumstances
i
owed
it
to
east
if
he
had
mentioned
her
name
the
story
might
have
come
out
but
the
one
drop
of
eastern
blood
which
mingles
with
a
hundred
of
the
west
in
anthony
veins
makes
him
singularly
reserved
aggravatingly
reticent
where
women
are
concerned
i
used
to
think
that
this
was
because
he
was
not
interested
in
them
but
something
i
ca
explain
what
unless
it
instinct
tells
me
that
this
is
no
longer
the
case
another
interest
has
come
into
his
life
rivalling
his
soldier
interest
and
the
secret
hope
buried
deep
in
our
mountain
i
see
it
in
his
eyes
i
hear
it
in
the
of
his
voice
it
means
woman
but
what
woman
is
monny
right
is
he
falling
seriously
in
love
for
the
first
time
in
his
strenuous
life
with
biddy
whom
he
picked
out
for
admiration
the
moment
he
set
eyes
on
her
or
is
it
monny
herself
i
must
be
a
dog
in
the
manger
because
i
do
like
the
idea
of
its
being
either
he
is
asleep
on
the
other
side
of
the
tent
as
i
write
desert
dogs
do
not
disturb
him
he
great
on
concentrating
his
mind
and
when
he
goes
to
sleep
he
concentrates
on
that
i
wish
he
talk
in
his
sleep
but
even
in
unconsciousness
he
is
discreet
as
a
statue
last
day
evening
i
am
in
disgrace
and
am
left
alone
to
bear
it
so
i
may
as
well
finish
my
desert
diary
it
all
an
account
of
a
lamb
just
an
ordinary
modern
lamb
you
might
meet
anywhere
but
i
must
begin
with
that
though
it
haunts
me
in
spirit
it
here
in
the
tent
sitting
at
my
feet
staring
up
into
my
face
avaunt
lamb
thy
blood
is
not
on
head
go
to
those
who
deserve
thee
i
wish
to
write
of
crocodilopolis
shetet
the
city
was
called
in
the
beginning
of
things
shetet
or
the
reclaimed
for
the
egyptians
stole
land
from
the
water
and
made
it
the
capital
of
their
great
lake
province
which
ptolemy
philadelphus
renamed
to
please
his
adored
wife
queen
arsinoë
was
charming
no
doubt
and
the
greek
ruins
and
papyri
of
her
day
are
interesting
but
it
is
the
city
sacred
to
the
crocodile
god
sebek
which
can
alone
distract
my
thoughts
now
from
the
tragedy
of
the
black
lamb
if
his
ka
refuses
to
go
i
shall
set
crocodiles
at
it
ghosts
of
crocodiles
mummied
somewhere
under
the
desert
hills
which
separate
the
fayoum
from
the
nile
valley
we
drove
out
to
the
ruins
in
a
string
of
hired
carriages
at
an
incredibly
early
hour
this
morning
as
the
night
was
one
long
and
the
dawn
one
overwhelming
cockcrow
people
were
thankful
to
get
up
but
what
a
waste
of
hardly
obtained
baths
before
the
start
between
medinet
and
crocodilopolis
rose
a
solid
wall
of
red
dust
we
had
to
break
through
it
as
firemen
dash
through
the
smoke
of
a
burning
house
and
when
our
arabeahs
stopped
at
the
foot
of
a
mountainous
mound
about
a
mile
out
of
medinet
the
dust
had
come
too
scrambling
up
with
the
wind
on
our
backs
we
began
to
breathe
but
it
was
not
until
we
had
ascended
to
the
old
guard
house
on
top
of
the
pottery
strewn
height
that
we
could
draw
a
clean
breath
then
the
reward
was
worth
the
pains
down
below
us
seen
as
from
a
view
lay
a
vast
unroofed
honeycomb
it
size
was
incredible
the
thing
could
not
really
be
there
it
was
a
startling
dream
that
endless
city
of
regular
streets
and
mud
brick
buildings
big
and
small
shops
and
houses
theatres
and
libraries
lacking
only
their
roofs
deserted
save
by
ghosts
for
thousands
of
years
yet
looking
as
though
it
had
been
destroyed
by
a
cyclone
yesterday
down
there
in
the
devastated
beehive
myriads
of
bees
still
worked
frantically
human
bees
which
cleopatra
said
were
reincarnations
of
those
who
had
owned
slaves
and
killed
them
with
forced
labour
when
shetet
was
among
the
richest
cities
of
the
two
lands
these
bees
of
worked
to
destroy
not
to
recreate
for
the
crumbling
brick
is
the
best
of
fertilizers
and
fertilizing
their
land
is
the
one
great
interest
in
life
for
the
fellaheen
of
the
fayoum
furiously
they
tore
at
the
remaining
walls
furiously
they
packed
away
their
treasure
of
dried
mud
in
sacks
furiously
they
piled
it
on
backs
of
donkeys
and
rushed
away
to
make
room
for
others
each
instant
hundreds
of
wild
figures
in
dusty
black
or
blue
scampered
off
beating
loaded
donkeys
only
to
be
replaced
by
hundreds
more
doing
the
same
thing
in
the
same
manner
yet
always
a
few
forms
remained
stationary
they
were
police
guardians
of
the
ruins
men
armed
with
staves
whose
business
was
to
oversee
each
worker
sack
lest
some
rare
roll
of
papyri
some
rich
jewel
which
once
adorned
a
pampered
crocodile
of
the
lake
should
be
found
and
stolen
glimpsed
through
the
red
flame
of
blowing
ruby
dust
the
scene
was
a
vision
of
inferno
we
on
our
mount
looking
down
on
it
were
in
company
of
dante
and
virgil
the
rest
of
the
day
we
gave
to
a
excursion
to
illahun
and
the
brick
pyramid
of
hawara
there
was
much
laughing
and
shrieking
among
the
girls
of
the
set
i
do
count
monny
who
shrieks
for
nothing
less
terrible
than
the
largest
spiders
as
arabs
pushed
our
trolley
cars
along
the
line
and
we
were
frivolous
even
on
the
site
of
the
labyrinth
which
was
perhaps
copied
from
the
labyrinth
of
crete
the
set
were
frankly
disappointed
in
the
few
remains
of
granite
columns
and
carvings
but
vague
memories
of
jewels
seen
at
the
egyptian
museum
waked
an
interest
in
the
brick
pyramid
tomb
at
hawara
where
king
amenemhat
and
his
daughter
lay
for
a
few
thousand
years
all
of
us
were
eager
for
the
last
camp
tea
when
we
got
home
from
our
expedition
and
it
was
then
that
the
tragedy
happened
the
tragedy
of
the
black
lamb
how
could
i
guess
when
yusef
said
the
wanted
money
to
buy
meat
as
a
feast
for
the
last
day
that
they
meant
to
buy
it
alive
when
we
arrived
in
camp
an
idyllic
scene
was
being
enacted
a
woolly
black
lamb
with
a
particularly
engaging
facial
expression
was
being
hospitably
entertained
by
all
our
men
with
the
exception
of
the
chêf
they
formed
an
admiring
ring
round
it
taking
turns
in
feeding
it
with
bersim
and
patting
its
delightfully
innocent
head
it
was
difficult
to
say
which
was
happier
the
charming
guest
or
its
kind
hosts
how
of
them
said
miss
i
must
write
a
few
verses
about
this
for
our
home
paper
everybody
joined
with
her
in
thinking
the
arabs
sweet
and
enid
biddell
went
round
and
took
up
a
collection
the
men
arranged
a
football
match
for
our
benefit
to
show
their
gratitude
and
played
so
well
and
were
so
picturesque
that
sir
john
and
other
ardent
sportsmen
pressed
more
money
upon
them
it
was
altogether
a
day
for
the
quite
apart
from
the
fact
that
they
would
get
rid
of
their
noble
benefactors
and
by
way
of
a
climax
they
had
what
we
supposed
to
be
a
bonfire
at
dark
are
all
those
white
figures
wonderful
grouped
round
the
blaze
asked
monny
who
appeared
on
the
whole
satisfied
with
the
way
in
which
the
desert
had
taken
her
and
look
the
flames
are
reflected
on
the
clouds
i
do
believe
it
going
to
if
such
a
thing
can
happen
here
i
hope
it
wo
spoil
the
poor
darlings
celebration
why
they
seem
to
have
something
big
and
black
hanging
over
the
fire
what
it
be
oh
it
looks
awful
it
is
not
awful
mees
yusef
standing
near
good
naturedly
reassured
her
it
very
naice
it
is
the
lamb
they
cook
for
their
supper
the
genelman
milord
he
give
them
money
to
buy
it
lamb
shrieked
monny
in
a
wild
voice
which
brought
a
crowd
round
us
not
oh
not
yes
mees
you
all
see
it
feeded
when
you
come
home
when
you
say
it
so
sweet
find
sweeter
now
oh
the
girl
exclaimed
fiends
they
invited
that
lamb
here
and
brought
it
in
their
arms
and
played
with
it
and
did
everything
they
could
to
make
it
think
it
was
having
a
pleasant
afternoon
and
then
they
it
of
course
yes
mees
said
yusef
puzzled
why
else
for
milord
tell
they
can
buy
it
they
kill
and
pound
it
up
to
make
it
good
and
soon
they
eat
in
honour
of
the
genelmen
and
ladies
who
have
been
so
kind
this
naice
trip
i
should
like
to
kill
gasped
monny
preparing
to
cry
and
flinging
herself
into
biddy
arms
oh
give
me
a
hanky
quick
we
all
felt
mechanically
in
our
pockets
but
i
being
nearest
was
first
in
the
field
it
was
a
shock
to
see
monny
wave
my
handkerchief
away
with
a
gesture
of
horror
and
bury
her
face
in
a
far
inferior
one
tendered
by
anthony
no
exclaimed
miss
who
is
not
as
a
rule
a
you
right
miss
gilder
lord
ernest
borrow
i
do
see
difference
between
you
and
a
murderer
for
a
minute
i
did
not
know
what
she
meant
then
it
broke
upon
me
that
the
arabs
monstrous
breach
of
hospitality
to
the
lamb
was
laid
at
my
door
i
jabbered
explanations
but
no
one
listened
and
just
then
the
rain
which
nobody
had
believed
in
seized
the
opportunity
of
coming
down
in
floods
the
camels
roared
with
rage
and
surprise
the
swore
arab
oaths
the
fire
sputtered
and
what
became
of
the
lamb
i
shall
never
know
we
rushed
for
the
all
soaked
in
an
instant
with
the
exception
of
brigit
and
monny
whom
antoun
protected
with
a
long
cloak
dinner
was
a
gloomy
feast
which
might
have
been
composed
of
funeral
baked
meats
though
the
chêf
himself
came
to
the
door
and
vowed
by
all
his
saints
that
the
lamb
cutlets
were
not
from
lamb
so
well
did
he
exonerate
himself
so
eloquently
did
he
protest
that
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
orgy
that
another
special
collection
was
taken
up
for
him
poor
dear
old
gentleman
sighed
miss
i
shall
never
be
able
to
forget
him
when
i
out
of
this
awful
country
of
and
safe
in
my
own
home
he
will
simply
haunt
me
passing
his
respectable
old
age
black
though
he
is
chasing
across
deserts
on
camels
wrapped
in
a
blanket
and
covered
with
chicken
coops
at
the
mercy
of
any
queer
christian
who
can
afford
to
pay
for
him
it
a
perhaps
she
wrote
her
poem
about
the
cook
instead
of
the
luckily
however
at
the
last
moment
i
remembered
a
superstition
of
the
ancient
egyptians
they
were
in
the
habit
of
sacrificing
a
black
lamb
to
propitiate
set
the
sender
of
storms
our
lamb
black
and
at
the
hour
of
his
untimely
death
a
storm
was
coming
up
the
dreadful
deed
therefore
was
turned
into
a
rite
chapter
xvi
an
oiled
hand
that
is
where
my
diary
of
the
desert
stopped
for
the
adventure
that
ended
our
trip
was
not
of
the
sort
that
mixes
well
with
tragedies
of
lambs
before
dinner
monny
had
apologized
for
refusing
my
handkerchief
i
really
believe
because
she
was
sorry
she
had
misunderstood
because
the
rain
had
leaked
through
her
tent
and
she
wanted
me
to
give
her
mine
in
fact
she
and
biddy
refused
pointblank
at
first
when
anthony
and
i
suggested
the
change
they
would
not
have
told
us
that
the
water
had
come
in
on
their
beds
if
they
had
thought
we
would
suggest
such
a
thing
all
they
wished
for
was
to
have
the
somehow
mended
before
matters
got
worse
but
we
insisted
especially
fenton
and
he
is
difficult
to
disobey
a
look
from
him
and
a
drawing
together
of
the
black
eyebrows
has
the
same
effect
on
the
mind
of
a
rebellious
woman
as
an
off
with
her
head
from
an
arabian
nights
sultan
while
i
might
vainly
exert
my
ingenuity
to
achieve
the
result
he
gets
by
sheer
mysterious
magnetism
it
was
bedtime
when
the
leak
showed
itself
but
the
change
of
quarters
was
accomplished
with
military
quickness
and
precision
as
undertakings
generally
are
and
almost
before
they
knew
what
had
happened
monny
and
brigit
who
had
been
during
the
tour
found
themselves
transferred
bag
and
baggage
to
our
tent
with
the
last
clean
sheets
in
the
possession
transferred
we
set
ourselves
to
making
repairs
and
soon
patched
up
the
leaks
rain
at
this
season
comes
so
rarely
it
was
not
surprising
that
a
stitch
or
two
had
been
neglected
only
the
pillows
and
upper
blankets
had
had
time
to
get
wet
and
we
had
but
to
remove
the
coverings
and
turn
the
pillows
we
both
did
this
simultaneously
and
simultaneously
exclaimed
hullo
they
left
their
treasures
said
anthony
not
with
quite
the
masculine
scorn
of
feminine
weaknesses
i
was
used
to
noticing
in
him
indeed
he
spoke
almost
tenderly
as
a
father
might
speak
at
finding
the
forgotten
doll
of
an
absent
child
each
of
us
stood
with
a
wet
pillow
in
his
hand
gazing
at
his
borrowed
bunk
in
the
one
i
had
selected
lay
a
small
bag
attached
to
a
narrow
pink
ribbon
in
the
bed
chosen
by
fenton
was
a
tiny
white
enamelled
watch
on
a
platinum
chain
both
these
things
had
been
covered
by
their
respective
owners
pillows
and
forgotten
in
the
hasty
change
of
quarters
the
watch
was
monny
she
wore
it
round
her
neck
every
day
therefore
the
bag
on
the
other
bed
must
be
brigit
i
told
myself
that
in
it
she
probably
kept
her
pathetic
store
of
money
hidden
under
her
bodice
by
day
her
pillow
by
night
and
beholding
this
intimate
souvenir
of
my
childhood
friend
my
heart
yearned
over
her
too
late
to
rouse
them
up
now
said
anthony
yes
said
i
we
must
have
been
twenty
minutes
or
half
an
hour
getting
the
roof
to
rights
they
may
be
asleep
and
if
not
they
worry
anyhow
they
know
that
their
things
are
safe
till
morning
fenton
agreed
with
this
verdict
and
each
keeping
charge
of
his
own
treasure
trove
we
went
to
bed
and
to
sleep
i
am
a
champion
dreamer
so
much
so
that
i
often
find
the
life
of
dreamland
rivalling
in
interest
the
life
this
side
of
sleep
i
look
forward
to
my
dreams
as
some
people
look
forward
to
an
interesting
but
that
night
i
was
too
tired
to
inspect
the
before
lying
down
to
it
the
first
thing
i
knew
a
handsome
egyptian
god
with
crystal
eyes
like
those
which
bill
bailey
means
to
make
the
fashion
stood
by
my
bedside
i
asked
him
politely
whether
he
were
rã
or
osiris
deliberately
picking
the
two
best
gods
of
the
bunch
in
order
to
flatter
him
but
without
answering
he
pointed
a
bronze
hand
to
the
mat
on
which
he
stood
it
was
a
white
mat
and
on
it
i
read
a
word
which
evidently
he
meant
me
to
take
as
his
name
tam
htab
for
an
instant
it
seemed
to
me
a
fine
name
for
an
egyptian
god
though
i
had
met
it
before
then
i
burst
out
laughing
disrespectfully
why
you
only
a
bath
mat
wrong
side
out
i
heard
myself
sneering
and
the
god
disappeared
as
a
flash
of
lightning
comes
and
is
gone
in
going
however
he
stumbled
slightly
against
the
bed
it
was
a
mere
touch
but
that
or
my
own
voice
half
waked
me
up
tam
htab
i
mumbled
dreamily
and
was
just
reminding
myself
before
dropping
off
to
sleep
again
that
i
must
tell
biddy
about
the
new
bath
god
when
i
realized
that
he
had
not
quite
gone
no
not
quite
gone
it
must
be
he
who
still
lingered
by
the
bed
for
it
could
be
nobody
else
anthony
would
not
come
and
hover
silently
at
my
bedside
in
the
middle
of
the
night
besides
i
was
almost
awake
now
and
i
could
hear
the
gentle
regular
breathing
of
a
man
asleep
anthony
breathing
go
away
tam
htab
i
tried
to
say
but
i
was
not
awake
enough
to
speak
he
was
bending
over
the
bed
his
face
was
near
to
mine
i
felt
rather
than
saw
it
how
could
i
see
in
the
dark
sleepily
even
fretfully
i
asked
myself
and
yet
the
tent
dark
it
had
been
i
remembered
that
i
remembered
that
anthony
had
got
to
bed
first
and
i
had
extinguished
the
two
candles
on
the
afterward
i
had
had
to
grope
my
way
to
the
bed
now
however
there
was
a
light
a
very
faint
rather
curious
light
there
seemed
to
be
only
a
square
of
it
a
square
sloped
off
at
the
top
it
was
opposite
my
eyes
which
really
were
open
now
i
felt
sure
i
could
be
dreaming
this
it
was
like
a
window
in
the
blackness
a
window
full
of
starlight
but
close
to
the
floor
then
the
rain
must
have
stopped
the
stars
must
be
out
yes
but
how
could
i
see
that
there
was
no
window
in
the
tent
this
thought
dragged
the
last
film
of
sleep
off
my
tired
brain
like
a
veil
snatched
away
by
impatient
fingers
on
an
unseen
hand
odd
those
very
words
said
over
themselves
in
my
head
fingers
on
an
unseen
hand
and
that
was
because
a
hand
was
being
slipped
cautiously
inch
by
inch
under
my
pillow
it
was
the
egyptian
god
hand
but
i
knew
suddenly
that
the
had
turned
into
a
thief
that
the
square
of
light
was
one
of
the
tent
flaps
unbuttoned
and
turned
back
that
the
man
must
stealthily
have
pulled
up
a
peg
or
two
while
we
slept
our
heavy
sleep
must
have
crept
into
the
tent
over
the
thick
rugs
and
now
here
he
was
trying
to
steal
after
that
i
did
not
go
on
with
the
thought
my
dull
reasoning
snapped
off
as
short
as
a
dry
stick
i
made
a
grab
for
the
hand
under
my
pillow
seized
a
wrist
held
it
for
an
instant
in
a
grip
which
must
have
hurt
then
had
the
shame
and
disappointment
of
feeling
it
slip
out
of
my
grasp
like
a
greased
snake
there
was
a
stifled
exclamation
of
pain
or
surprise
scarcely
louder
than
a
sigh
and
i
was
out
of
bed
and
after
a
shadow
that
ran
for
the
low
square
of
starlight
something
caught
and
tripped
me
as
i
reached
the
opening
what
it
was
i
did
not
know
then
and
do
know
now
but
i
had
a
vague
impression
that
it
was
warm
if
i
had
stumbled
against
a
bare
leg
thrust
out
to
stop
me
it
would
have
felt
like
that
yet
it
could
not
have
been
the
leg
of
the
man
running
away
he
was
using
both
his
and
must
have
used
them
well
for
i
was
up
and
out
from
under
the
lifted
tent
flap
which
had
fallen
on
top
of
me
as
i
tumbled
before
i
could
have
counted
five
very
wide
awake
now
i
stood
in
the
rough
sandy
grass
under
a
sky
encrusted
with
stars
and
could
see
no
one
barefooted
i
pattered
this
way
and
that
searching
every
shadow
but
the
whole
camp
seemed
an
abode
of
peace
there
was
not
a
sound
or
movement
even
in
the
black
ring
of
sleeping
camels
rain
had
driven
to
shelter
the
roving
dogs
which
had
troubled
us
last
night
the
camp
lanterns
burned
clear
and
strong
yellow
and
crude
in
the
silver
flood
of
starlight
which
dulled
their
radiance
the
smell
of
earth
and
grass
after
the
heavy
shower
was
like
the
fragrance
of
tea
roses
could
it
be
that
an
evil
stealthy
presence
had
but
just
broken
this
sweet
serenity
with
its
vile
intention
or
had
the
whole
incident
been
after
all
a
singularly
vivid
dream
i
should
have
believed
so
if
my
hand
which
had
clutched
that
other
hand
had
not
been
slippery
with
oil
no
i
had
not
dreamed
and
suddenly
a
troubling
thought
leaped
into
my
mind
biddy
the
name
sprang
to
my
lips
and
spoke
itself
aloud
if
this
were
for
her
i
had
laughed
at
her
forebodings
sensational
revenges
such
as
she
feared
seemed
so
incongruous
so
utterly
unsuited
to
those
laughing
eyes
of
hers
yet
she
had
in
her
past
life
lived
side
by
side
with
fear
and
tragedy
for
more
years
than
i
liked
to
count
and
as
she
said
men
such
as
those
whom
richard
had
betrayed
had
been
known
to
reach
out
very
far
to
take
revenge
biddy
had
done
nothing
surely
they
owed
her
no
grudge
but
she
had
known
things
perhaps
they
thought
that
she
knew
even
more
than
she
did
know
their
organization
was
rich
as
well
as
powerful
it
had
many
branches
yet
why
should
men
use
its
power
to
hurt
the
widow
of
a
dead
enemy
now
that
they
or
fate
had
put
him
underground
in
a
flash
i
remembered
the
bag
which
she
had
forgotten
under
the
pillow
and
lifting
the
loosened
canvas
flap
with
its
dangling
pegs
i
stooped
to
go
back
into
the
tent
inside
i
expected
to
find
darkness
but
instead
i
found
light
anthony
up
setting
a
match
to
a
candle
wick
and
looking
a
tall
dark
silhouette
in
his
pyjamas
what
the
row
he
calmly
wanted
to
know
too
calmly
to
suit
my
ruffled
mood
a
thief
that
all
i
answered
hastily
searching
under
the
pillow
where
the
unseen
hand
had
been
sheet
and
were
slimy
with
oil
yet
the
bag
was
safe
but
he
did
get
what
he
wanted
i
finished
good
said
anthony
who
had
lighted
both
candles
let
go
look
for
him
i
been
and
could
see
anything
i
know
i
heard
a
sound
i
sang
out
and
you
did
answer
so
i
thought
something
must
be
up
let
have
another
try
i
got
miss
gilder
watch
i
slipped
biddy
bag
into
the
pocket
of
my
pyjamas
and
pulling
on
our
boots
we
went
out
into
the
night
it
tent
i
thinking
of
i
said
though
i
never
talked
of
brigit
affairs
to
fenton
if
some
one
had
planned
to
rob
them
not
knowing
of
the
change
we
made
at
the
last
minute
all
our
arabs
did
know
i
not
talking
of
them
we
been
here
two
days
any
one
could
have
spied
on
us
enough
to
find
out
which
tent
was
jones
and
miss
gilder
you
thinking
of
bedr
well
yes
i
suppose
i
am
biddy
never
believed
they
were
germans
who
those
chaps
in
checked
clothes
he
had
in
tow
by
jove
yes
i
heard
her
speak
of
a
scar
on
the
forehead
of
one
she
thought
he
might
have
been
burke
the
fellow
in
the
street
row
that
night
at
the
house
of
the
crocodile
these
things
happen
to
heiresses
in
story
books
said
anthony
but
there
nothing
that
happens
in
a
story
which
happen
in
real
life
i
suppose
especially
to
a
girl
she
oh
but
i
was
thinking
of
her
i
began
then
stopped
shocked
because
it
was
true
and
also
because
i
was
unwilling
to
tell
why
my
thoughts
had
turned
to
mrs
jones
we
must
find
out
if
they
safe
i
went
on
the
thieves
seem
to
have
got
clear
away
and
we
not
likely
to
find
them
unless
gone
to
our
old
tent
come
along
said
anthony
we
slip
on
something
and
call
the
ladies
as
softly
as
we
can
not
to
disturb
the
others
and
have
the
whole
camp
buzzing
like
a
beehive
when
we
sure
all
right
we
can
attend
to
such
details
as
searching
for
tracks
he
seemed
as
eager
as
i
was
to
know
that
the
two
women
were
safe
but
there
was
no
sign
to
tell
me
about
which
one
he
chiefly
concerned
himself
a
minute
transformed
him
from
a
pyjamaed
englishman
into
a
robed
egyptian
of
that
order
which
despises
things
european
only
he
forgot
to
put
on
his
turban
i
did
think
of
the
omission
myself
at
the
time
but
i
recalled
it
later
going
to
the
tent
which
had
been
ours
i
scratched
on
the
tight
drawn
canvas
near
the
spot
where
i
knew
one
of
the
folding
iron
bedsteads
was
placed
biddy
biddy
i
called
gently
and
after
a
few
repetitions
i
heard
her
voice
rather
sleepy
a
little
anxious
cry
is
that
you
duffer
yes
i
whispered
seeing
the
tent
quiver
in
the
region
of
some
big
cushiony
buttons
and
i
are
both
here
but
do
be
scared
could
you
come
and
peep
out
from
under
the
door
flap
a
minute
yes
said
she
go
round
there
and
i
come
there
was
not
much
delay
for
biddy
crinkled
black
hair
needs
no
night
disfigurements
by
way
of
patent
curlers
in
a
few
seconds
the
door
flap
waved
and
biddy
looked
out
into
the
starlight
the
yellow
glimmer
of
a
candle
flame
within
the
tent
silhouetting
the
japanesey
little
figure
wrapped
in
a
kimono
behind
her
dark
head
and
above
it
floated
a
mist
of
bronzy
gold
which
i
took
to
be
miss
gilder
hair
there
seemed
to
be
quantities
of
it
and
i
should
have
been
feverishly
interested
in
wondering
how
long
it
was
if
i
had
had
time
to
think
of
anything
but
my
thankfulness
that
biddy
and
monny
were
both
safe
are
either
of
you
ill
asked
the
creamy
irish
voice
which
had
never
sounded
half
so
sweet
as
now
in
the
starlight
and
fragrance
of
this
strange
night
because
if
you
are
i
some
lovely
medicine
i
would
frighten
them
any
more
than
i
could
help
if
i
were
you
i
heard
fenton
mumbling
advice
in
muffled
tones
at
my
back
for
obvious
reasons
i
made
no
audible
answer
but
i
had
just
been
resolving
not
to
tell
biddy
my
suspicions
unless
it
were
necessary
to
do
so
no
we
not
ill
i
assured
her
but
there
been
a
silly
sort
of
scare
about
a
sneak
thief
may
have
been
a
false
alarm
and
we
say
anything
about
it
if
others
do
we
horribly
sorry
to
disturb
you
and
miss
gilder
but
we
could
rest
without
making
sure
you
had
been
worried
heard
nothing
did
you
monny
brigit
threw
a
question
over
her
shoulder
to
the
floating
mist
of
gold
no
and
i
was
asleep
either
miss
gilder
voice
answered
i
was
lying
awake
thinking
about
its
being
our
last
night
and
lots
of
things
i
was
lying
half
awake
too
thinking
of
of
things
biddy
mimicked
her
friend
or
i
should
have
heard
you
so
easily
when
you
scratched
on
the
canvas
oh
by
the
way
duffer
did
you
or
antoun
effendi
find
a
little
bag
under
the
pillow
i
found
it
said
i
and
this
gave
me
a
chance
i
had
been
wanting
but
had
quite
known
how
to
snatch
i
was
rather
worried
over
the
responsibility
of
course
you
knew
that
we
take
care
of
your
treasures
it
all
my
money
and
and
just
other
thing
biddy
answered
with
an
odd
little
hesitation
in
her
manner
and
a
catch
in
her
voice
i
should
hate
to
have
anybody
open
that
bag
i
thankful
it
safe
with
you
i
know
it
all
the
same
i
like
to
have
it
if
you
do
mind
the
bother
you
ought
to
carry
the
thing
about
with
you
if
it
so
important
i
scolded
her
why
not
leave
your
secret
treasure
whatever
it
is
and
most
of
your
money
in
cairo
when
you
come
off
on
an
expedition
like
this
i
do
know
she
mumbled
evasively
i
used
to
having
this
thing
with
me
i
ca
think
how
i
forgot
it
under
my
pillow
i
never
have
before
it
is
the
sort
of
of
valuable
one
keeps
in
a
bank
monny
embroidered
the
bag
when
she
was
a
little
girl
it
was
her
first
work
i
taught
her
how
to
do
it
and
she
gave
it
to
me
for
a
birthday
present
i
would
lose
it
for
the
world
you
sha
i
said
soothingly
i
had
heard
what
i
had
been
afraid
to
hear
but
why
should
biddy
trip
be
spoiled
by
another
worry
if
i
could
shield
her
we
could
not
that
the
oiled
hand
had
been
groping
for
that
bag
and
i
resolved
not
to
distress
brigit
by
putting
the
idea
into
her
head
at
present
go
to
sleep
again
in
peace
both
of
you
i
went
on
all
well
since
are
well
probably
some
prowler
has
been
sneaking
round
the
yes
the
news
of
the
lamb
has
gone
forth
said
biddy
good
night
good
night
i
answered
down
went
the
tent
flap
and
hid
the
sparkle
of
eyes
in
starsheen
and
mist
of
gold
in
wavering
we
trusted
that
the
two
had
crept
back
into
their
beds
but
we
did
not
return
to
ours
we
took
one
of
the
camp
lanterns
and
searched
for
footprints
those
which
were
freshest
after
the
rain
the
rough
grass
growing
sparsely
out
of
the
sandy
earth
was
not
favourable
to
such
attempts
however
and
even
at
dawn
when
we
looked
again
before
the
camp
was
stirring
we
made
no
notable
discoveries
such
as
amateur
detectives
make
in
books
our
next
expedition
as
soon
as
light
came
was
to
the
town
where
we
inquired
at
the
few
hotels
and
put
questions
to
the
police
nobody
answering
the
description
of
bedr
and
his
two
companions
had
been
seen
in
medinet
and
we
had
to
go
back
to
camp
baffled
there
was
our
adventure
and
when
we
reached
cairo
by
train
the
mystery
of
the
oiled
hand
was
still
unsolved
chapter
xvii
the
ship
mystery
again
i
expected
a
black
mark
for
the
lamb
and
every
little
desert
difficulty
but
to
my
surprise
only
our
joys
were
remembered
those
who
had
stayed
in
cairo
exchanged
tales
with
the
desert
travellers
and
it
was
astonishing
to
hear
what
a
marvellous
week
we
had
had
each
day
had
been
better
than
its
brother
in
fact
our
trip
had
been
one
long
glorious
dream
of
golden
sands
and
amethyst
sunsets
the
camels
were
as
easy
to
ride
as
sofas
and
combined
the
intelligence
of
human
beings
with
the
disposition
of
angels
the
camp
was
as
luxurious
as
the
savoy
or
the
plaza
and
to
me
and
that
wonderful
antoun
effendi
all
credit
was
suddenly
due
not
to
be
outdone
the
stayers
in
cairo
had
had
the
time
of
their
lives
they
had
not
been
herded
together
like
animals
in
a
menagerie
as
in
colonel
corkran
day
the
girls
had
not
only
been
to
dances
but
had
danced
with
darling
pets
of
officers
friends
of
ernest
borrow
while
their
mothers
had
been
asked
to
those
fascinating
picnics
they
get
up
in
egypt
do
you
know
where
you
dig
in
ancient
burial
grounds
and
find
mummy
beads
and
amulets
somehow
or
other
all
these
people
attributed
their
pleasures
to
me
as
they
had
blamed
me
for
their
mishaps
and
my
spirits
were
at
the
top
of
the
thermometer
three
days
later
when
after
some
hard
work
the
was
ready
to
start
up
nile
sir
marcus
wanted
his
tours
to
be
different
from
every
other
nile
tour
and
a
little
better
he
wanted
to
show
what
he
could
do
and
he
was
beginning
well
though
the
had
had
a
past
under
other
owners
she
looked
as
if
this
were
her
maiden
trip
and
she
was
as
beautifully
decorated
as
a
débutante
for
her
first
ball
her
paint
was
new
and
gleaming
white
her
brass
and
nickel
glittered
like
jewellery
and
even
those
who
thought
nothing
quite
good
enough
for
them
uttered
admiring
ohs
as
they
trooped
on
board
the
highway
of
egypt
was
a
road
leading
to
adventure
the
masts
of
native
boats
lying
along
the
river
bank
were
etched
in
black
lines
crowding
one
over
another
on
the
lightly
background
of
blue
near
by
the
great
bridge
gleamed
with
colour
and
life
like
a
rainbow
come
alive
and
the
looked
as
gay
and
inviting
as
a
houseboat
for
henley
regatta
she
was
smaller
than
the
most
modern
of
the
nile
boats
for
she
had
been
sold
cheap
to
sir
marcus
by
another
firm
but
she
was
big
enough
for
his
experiment
though
he
had
turned
some
of
her
cabins
into
private
baths
and
her
three
decks
towered
out
of
the
water
with
a
superior
air
of
stateliness
such
as
small
women
put
on
beside
tall
sisters
and
her
upper
deck
was
a
big
there
were
turkish
rugs
on
the
white
floor
and
basket
chairs
and
sofas
with
silk
cushions
on
the
tables
and
on
the
piano
top
there
were
of
egypt
and
magazines
and
bowls
of
flowers
from
the
roof
sprouted
electric
lamps
with
brass
leaves
and
glass
lotuses
and
smiling
arabs
in
white
from
turban
to
slippers
had
blue
larks
flying
on
their
breasts
oh
yes
sir
marcus
was
doing
his
clients
well
that
was
patent
at
first
glance
and
became
even
more
conspicuous
to
the
eyes
of
the
set
as
they
wandered
into
the
dining
saloon
and
library
or
peeped
into
each
other
cabins
sir
marcus
himself
had
come
on
board
ostensibly
to
see
us
off
really
to
watch
the
effect
of
his
boat
upon
cleopatra
he
lay
in
wait
for
her
outside
the
door
of
her
suite
the
best
on
board
pretending
to
engage
me
in
conversation
but
forgot
my
existence
as
she
appeared
the
ecstasy
on
his
big
face
was
pathetic
as
his
brown
eyes
fixed
themselves
on
a
quantity
of
artificial
blue
lotuses
she
held
in
her
hands
do
you
like
mrs
east
he
ventured
do
i
like
what
she
inquired
that
quiver
of
impatience
in
her
tone
which
she
kept
for
her
unfortunate
adorer
the
those
flowers
he
stammered
i
they
she
exclaimed
the
rooms
are
lovely
but
these
dreadful
artificial
things
some
person
has
stuck
all
over
the
place
spoil
the
whole
effect
i
want
to
find
an
arab
to
take
them
away
or
do
you
think
i
might
throw
them
overboard
no
one
like
them
i
sure
of
course
chuck
overboard
or
hand
to
me
and
i
do
it
said
sir
marcus
looking
ready
to
cry
but
they
i
suppose
you
know
i
heard
you
say
you
give
anything
to
have
some
not
artificial
ones
explained
cleopatra
dame
sans
i
ca
stand
artificial
flowers
even
on
hats
much
less
in
rooms
who
could
have
put
such
horrors
all
over
my
i
do
know
sir
marcus
lied
stoutly
but
it
sha
happen
again
there
ai
any
real
lotuses
to
be
got
so
maybe
the
er
the
decorator
his
meanderings
died
into
silence
as
he
took
the
bunch
of
flowers
from
east
and
viciously
flung
them
as
tribute
to
the
nile
after
all
we
ought
to
do
that
said
cleopatra
in
the
beautiful
old
days
real
lotuses
were
given
to
the
nile
these
are
an
insult
they
are
meant
as
such
the
big
man
apologized
all
joy
in
his
fine
boat
and
the
compliments
he
had
received
crushed
out
of
him
i
knew
now
that
he
had
hovered
at
cleopatra
door
hoping
for
a
cry
of
pleasure
probably
he
had
ransacked
cairo
for
the
lotuses
or
telegraphed
to
paris
before
his
cruel
lady
went
from
him
into
the
desert
i
was
sorry
for
the
boss
though
a
snub
or
two
would
be
good
for
him
no
doubt
and
perhaps
were
being
specially
provided
by
a
wise
providence
but
i
had
other
things
to
think
of
than
sir
marcus
monny
for
instance
who
at
last
had
found
a
letter
from
madame
wretched
in
cairo
and
had
wonderful
schemes
in
her
head
on
board
the
i
should
have
thought
such
schemes
obstinate
and
headstrong
the
wish
of
a
spoiled
child
to
do
something
dangerous
to
meddle
in
matters
which
did
not
concern
her
and
to
have
an
adventure
but
i
understood
the
gilded
rose
a
little
better
now
i
began
to
see
the
real
monny
as
biddy
saw
her
bright
with
the
flame
of
courage
and
enthusiasm
and
passionate
generosity
behind
the
passing
cloud
of
superficial
faults
she
wanted
everybody
to
be
as
fortunate
and
happy
as
she
and
was
prepared
to
be
exceedingly
trying
and
disagreeable
in
the
effort
to
make
them
so
we
had
not
been
on
board
ten
minutes
when
biddy
told
me
about
the
exciting
letter
and
escorted
me
to
find
it
and
monny
miss
gilder
was
in
the
act
of
insisting
that
general
and
harlow
should
accept
her
suite
and
that
she
should
take
their
cabin
the
matter
had
to
be
argued
out
before
she
could
spare
attention
for
anything
else
but
as
she
made
it
clear
that
the
harlows
were
not
to
pay
extra
their
scruples
were
soon
conquered
the
baggage
has
been
put
into
the
cabins
yet
she
explained
breathlessly
to
me
so
that
all
right
in
my
astonishment
i
forgot
madame
wretched
but
why
i
adjured
monny
in
my
professional
tone
as
conductor
why
on
earth
should
you
sacrifice
yourself
to
these
people
what
have
they
done
for
you
i
thought
you
did
like
them
i
do
she
replied
calmly
while
biddy
listened
smiling
why
i
gave
them
my
suite
at
least
it
partly
why
i
should
think
the
other
part
of
the
is
more
convincing
i
remarked
and
monny
blushed
perhaps
you
know
that
your
friend
antoun
effendi
thinks
me
the
most
selfish
as
well
as
the
most
obstinate
girl
he
ever
saw
she
said
and
i
do
intend
to
have
foreigners
like
him
go
on
doing
american
girls
an
injustice
besides
maybe
he
right
about
me
and
i
want
him
to
be
wrong
i
hate
having
all
the
best
things
there
are
everywhere
just
because
i
rich
the
harlows
wanted
a
suite
and
they
could
afford
to
take
one
they
were
looking
sadly
through
the
door
at
my
rooms
and
envying
me
so
i
thought
i
would
change
i
was
to
change
whether
they
would
let
me
or
not
they
are
old
i
young
and
i
shall
enjoy
thinking
i
done
something
nice
for
people
i
thoroughly
dislike
as
much
as
will
enjoy
having
their
own
bathroom
if
harlow
could
hear
you
calling
her
old
gurgled
biddy
well
she
old
and
she
perfectly
horrid
much
more
horrid
even
than
miss
so
i
rather
give
my
suite
to
her
and
her
husband
than
any
one
else
biddy
and
rachel
are
together
and
aunt
clara
is
alone
i
robbing
no
one
but
myself
how
do
you
know
antoun
effendi
thinks
you
selfish
and
obstinate
i
inquired
surely
he
was
rude
enough
to
say
so
he
was
indeed
the
day
i
have
the
coastguard
camel
and
he
came
after
me
when
it
ran
away
she
confessed
and
you
not
to
tell
him
about
the
suite
i
did
give
it
up
to
please
him
i
thought
you
did
i
ventured
in
order
that
egyptian
princes
should
do
injustice
to
american
girls
i
meant
she
explained
hastily
that
i
like
to
know
they
about
us
and
now
what
was
it
that
biddy
and
you
wanted
to
say
oh
poor
mabel
letter
how
thankful
i
am
to
get
it
i
been
wondering
if
i
dared
write
and
thinking
of
all
sorts
of
desperate
plans
but
biddy
thought
we
must
wait
till
wretched
was
off
his
guard
you
see
we
shall
have
to
rescue
her
when
we
get
to
asiut
i
would
have
answered
but
a
look
from
biddy
enjoined
silence
and
so
we
were
in
touch
with
the
ship
mystery
again
i
took
the
envelope
which
was
addressed
to
miss
gilder
in
a
distinctively
american
handwriting
strange
to
see
coming
from
an
egyptian
harem
the
letter
began
abruptly
and
showed
signs
of
haste
you
were
so
good
i
know
i
can
appeal
to
you
but
i
not
sure
if
there
any
way
to
help
me
i
began
to
be
frightened
on
the
ship
when
behaved
so
queerly
just
because
i
talked
about
the
most
ordinary
things
to
one
or
two
men
he
made
me
stay
in
my
cabin
but
remember
that
already
it
like
ages
ago
i
tell
myself
now
that
i
was
almost
happy
then
at
least
i
believed
i
was
his
and
that
it
was
better
than
being
poor
and
a
governess
to
hateful
french
children
in
paris
he
was
kind
too
he
seemed
to
love
me
and
i
thought
it
was
like
living
in
a
romance
to
marry
a
turk
he
swore
he
never
loved
any
one
except
me
that
he
never
been
married
and
that
he
would
try
to
convert
me
or
shut
me
up
like
turkish
women
but
everything
was
untrue
and
different
from
what
he
said
i
hardly
know
how
to
tell
you
for
you
will
think
it
horrible
yet
i
must
tell
when
i
came
here
i
found
he
a
wife
and
a
perfectly
fiendish
little
girl
it
is
legal
in
this
dreadful
country
to
have
four
wives
but
i
do
care
about
the
law
i
want
to
get
away
i
been
cheated
this
marriage
i
do
know
what
will
become
of
me
for
i
have
any
money
but
i
rather
starve
than
stay
i
heard
sheridan
say
on
board
ship
that
it
was
easy
to
get
a
divorce
in
egypt
or
turkey
maybe
he
meant
me
to
hear
thinking
some
day
i
might
be
glad
to
know
but
i
ca
get
a
divorce
while
i
shut
up
in
this
house
and
watched
now
suspects
i
want
to
leave
him
since
a
scene
we
had
about
the
wife
and
he
let
me
go
out
even
into
the
garden
you
are
my
only
hope
wonder
why
i
do
try
appealing
to
the
american
consul
here
instead
of
to
you
i
suppose
there
must
be
a
consul
asiut
seems
a
big
important
town
i
tell
you
why
i
do
for
one
thing
there
be
a
consul
for
another
thing
the
woman
who
has
promised
to
post
this
would
do
so
if
she
guessed
i
was
writing
against
my
husband
who
is
her
and
she
would
guess
if
she
saw
an
envelope
addressed
to
a
consul
although
she
knows
scarcely
any
english
i
have
to
talk
to
her
in
french
he
thinks
she
is
devoted
to
him
and
that
she
explaining
the
mussulman
religion
and
ideas
of
a
woman
life
to
me
or
he
would
let
her
come
it
true
she
is
loyal
to
him
in
a
way
she
would
help
me
to
escape
but
i
think
women
in
the
harems
like
to
have
secrets
with
each
other
which
they
hide
from
their
men
i
told
her
about
you
how
pretty
you
are
and
a
great
heiress
and
she
so
interested
she
dying
to
see
you
she
hopes
if
she
posts
this
letter
that
you
will
call
on
me
on
your
way
up
the
nile
she
can
perhaps
find
out
what
day
your
boat
is
to
arrive
through
her
husband
and
then
she
try
to
come
to
our
house
on
the
chance
of
meeting
you
i
almost
sure
she
keep
her
promise
and
post
this
letter
if
not
if
he
sees
it
maybe
he
will
kill
me
i
believe
now
he
would
do
anything
but
i
must
run
the
risk
do
come
do
think
of
some
way
to
help
mabel
i
do
feel
i
have
the
right
to
any
other
name
for
surely
as
he
has
a
wife
i
not
truly
married
well
asked
monny
as
she
saw
me
finish
and
fold
up
the
letter
you
were
horrid
about
her
at
first
but
just
at
the
last
minute
on
the
ship
you
were
good
and
kept
wretched
bey
talking
so
i
might
have
my
chance
with
mabel
if
you
had
i
should
like
you
as
much
as
i
do
and
i
sure
even
you
be
anxious
to
do
something
now
yet
we
do
wish
ernest
or
antoun
effendi
to
run
into
danger
do
we
dear
biddy
suggested
coaxingly
when
you
wanted
to
show
the
letter
i
said
yes
but
monny
listened
no
longer
her
eyes
were
sparkling
as
they
looked
straight
into
mine
antoun
effendi
she
repeated
tell
me
first
because
you
know
you
are
his
friend
what
would
he
think
about
a
case
like
this
whatever
he
is
he
not
a
mussulman
i
sure
still
not
one
of
us
you
sure
he
not
a
mussulman
i
echoed
what
makes
you
sure
when
you
know
he
been
to
mecca
unless
somebody
has
put
the
idea
into
your
head
his
own
head
put
it
there
she
answered
i
saw
it
without
his
turban
the
night
of
the
alarm
in
camp
it
was
shaved
as
i
read
the
heads
of
moslem
men
are
it
was
a
head
like
like
the
head
of
every
christian
man
i
know
except
that
it
was
a
better
shape
than
most
so
as
he
is
mussulman
he
might
not
mind
our
trying
to
help
this
poor
deceived
girl
shall
i
ask
his
advice
i
inquired
rather
drily
perhaps
she
hesitated
for
an
instant
then
said
yes
you
seem
certain
that
whatever
he
thinks
he
wo
betray
your
plan
i
am
certain
she
replied
looking
rapt
he
not
the
kind
of
man
who
betrays
you
right
i
said
he
not
the
kind
of
man
who
betrays
he
the
kind
that
helps
though
in
such
a
case
as
this
you
know
the
very
meaning
of
the
word
harem
is
sacred
or
forbidden
still
we
shall
see
we
could
not
see
at
once
however
because
anthony
had
not
come
on
board
even
when
the
hour
for
starting
arrived
there
was
no
anthony
no
message
from
anthony
your
friend
is
going
to
leave
us
in
the
lurch
is
he
asked
sir
marcus
watch
in
hand
he
had
meant
to
travel
with
us
as
far
as
beni
hasan
our
first
stop
and
return
to
cairo
by
donkey
and
train
but
had
changed
his
intention
and
was
going
off
at
once
i
thought
i
could
guess
why
the
ought
to
be
under
way
this
minute
but
antoun
and
you
are
our
chief
attractions
we
ca
leave
him
behind
i
agreed
we
could
not
leave
anthony
behind
but
i
was
not
worrying
if
he
had
to
drop
down
out
of
an
aeroplane
i
felt
sure
that
having
said
he
would
come
he
would
keep
his
word
so
while
sir
marcus
stared
at
his
watch
and
fumed
i
rushed
usefully
about
among
the
ladies
who
clamoured
for
their
luggage
or
complained
that
their
cabins
were
too
small
for
innovation
trunks
i
showed
them
how
these
travelling
wardrobes
could
be
opened
wide
and
flattened
against
the
walls
taking
up
next
to
no
room
i
assured
each
woman
in
confidence
that
she
had
been
given
the
best
cabin
on
the
boat
i
dealt
out
little
illustrated
books
about
the
trip
i
advised
people
which
tables
to
choose
in
the
and
consoled
them
when
the
places
they
wanted
were
gone
still
the
had
not
stirred
and
a
rumour
was
beginning
to
go
round
that
something
had
happened
when
suddenly
i
saw
antoun
effendi
green
turban
thank
goodness
muttered
sir
marcus
putting
his
watch
into
his
pocket
and
then
east
came
swiftly
across
the
deck
from
the
door
of
her
own
suite
where
she
must
have
stood
watching
hidden
behind
the
portière
oh
antoun
effendi
she
cried
and
though
her
face
was
turned
toward
us
she
did
not
seem
to
know
that
we
existed
how
anthony
looked
at
her
we
could
not
judge
for
we
saw
only
his
back
but
her
eyes
must
have
told
sir
marcus
a
piece
of
news
he
glanced
from
her
to
fenton
and
from
fenton
to
her
with
the
expression
of
a
who
has
been
punished
for
something
he
has
done
then
he
turned
to
me
as
though
to
ask
a
question
but
shut
his
mouth
tightly
as
if
gulping
down
a
large
pill
wheeled
and
left
me
without
a
i
wondered
what
he
had
done
in
his
last
incarnation
to
deserve
these
heavy
blows
in
the
hour
which
should
have
seen
his
triumph
what
if
he
changes
his
mind
and
does
want
fenton
and
me
after
all
i
asked
myself
to
my
surprise
i
realized
that
it
would
be
a
genuine
disappointment
not
to
be
wanted
by
sir
marcus
lark
the
mountain
of
the
golden
pyramid
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
it
was
borne
in
upon
me
that
i
had
begun
to
enjoy
the
rôle
of
conductor
and
certainly
i
was
learning
lessons
in
high
diplomacy
which
might
be
useful
in
my
career
anthony
who
was
free
as
an
eagle
from
questions
of
innovation
trunks
and
how
to
give
everybody
the
best
cabins
and
places
at
table
looked
as
if
he
were
bound
for
the
island
of
hesperides
on
a
voyage
of
pure
romance
the
air
of
gravity
and
responsibility
he
had
worn
in
cairo
and
in
the
desert
was
gone
with
the
starting
of
the
boat
i
knew
suddenly
without
asking
him
that
his
mission
had
been
of
a
far
more
serious
nature
than
the
transplanting
of
a
sheikh
tomb
that
there
had
been
something
else
and
that
it
had
finished
at
the
last
moment
in
success
sir
marcus
was
worrying
about
you
i
said
when
the
importance
of
unpacking
left
the
deck
empty
save
for
anthony
and
me
you
were
were
you
he
was
smiling
at
me
in
a
friendly
confidential
way
that
showed
a
happy
mood
not
i
i
knew
you
turn
up
as
you
said
you
would
thanks
my
good
duffer
but
now
it
over
i
do
mind
telling
you
that
it
was
a
toss
up
you
mean
there
was
a
chance
of
your
failing
us
in
spite
of
the
mountain
well
i
meant
to
bring
this
off
somehow
but
my
first
duty
was
to
finish
up
the
cairo
business
i
simply
had
to
finish
it
and
i
did
it
was
a
rather
bigger
job
than
the
sheikh
tomb
racket
though
of
course
that
was
on
the
cards
too
everything
all
right
now
but
i
spent
last
night
in
getting
the
full
details
of
an
arab
plot
to
blow
up
the
house
of
a
rich
copt
who
been
of
great
service
to
the
government
some
of
the
young
nationalists
think
that
the
christian
copts
are
put
ahead
of
moslems
by
the
british
and
there
are
jealousies
the
whole
set
of
men
concerned
in
this
affair
were
arrested
an
hour
ago
so
all
well
with
the
world
i
free
to
turn
my
face
toward
the
mountain
of
the
golden
pyramid
free
to
enjoy
myself
although
i
must
stick
to
my
turban
still
are
you
getting
tired
of
it
i
asked
i
been
tired
of
it
since
the
first
day
i
put
it
on
i
do
like
for
long
but
it
was
necessary
and
it
has
had
its
advantages
as
well
as
disadvantages
for
me
i
should
have
liked
to
ask
another
question
then
but
dared
not
so
instead
i
told
him
about
the
letter
from
bechid
bey
beautiful
american
bride
mabella
hânem
the
ship
mystery
of
the
anthony
listened
as
the
slipped
past
the
island
of
roda
past
ghizeh
past
old
cairo
and
still
older
babylon
then
out
on
to
the
broad
bosom
of
the
river
where
the
nile
valley
lay
bathed
in
sunshine
from
gebel
mokattam
in
the
east
to
the
libyan
hills
haunt
of
departed
spirits
in
the
west
miss
gilder
wants
me
to
help
does
she
he
asked
at
last
she
told
you
to
tell
me
about
this
i
warned
her
that
you
might
approve
i
explained
i
said
you
had
more
knowledge
of
egypt
in
your
little
finger
than
i
had
in
all
my
gray
matter
and
you
might
think
that
nothing
could
be
done
tell
her
i
think
something
may
be
done
he
interrupted
me
and
before
we
reach
asiut
we
plan
out
how
best
to
do
it
you
and
i
you
and
and
i
she
has
brains
as
well
as
courage
she
of
course
i
mean
miss
gilder
oh
is
it
course
there
are
others
who
answer
that
description
fenton
smiled
but
it
going
to
be
her
show
she
is
under
the
impression
i
reminded
him
laughing
that
all
egypt
including
the
nile
and
you
and
your
green
turban
are
her
anthony
did
not
answer
perhaps
already
he
was
thinking
of
something
else
i
should
have
liked
to
be
sure
exactly
what
his
smile
meant
was
it
for
monny
was
it
for
biddy
or
only
for
an
adventure
which
he
saw
in
the
distance
chapter
xviii
the
asiut
affair
nothing
could
be
less
appropriate
to
the
spirit
of
the
nile
than
our
spirit
in
setting
out
we
had
turned
our
backs
upon
medieval
cairo
and
our
faces
toward
ethiopia
our
minds
should
have
teemed
with
thoughts
of
early
gods
and
the
mysteries
of
their
great
temples
but
not
at
all
medieval
or
prehistoric
it
was
all
one
to
us
in
our
secret
hearts
which
throbbed
with
passionate
excitement
over
our
own
small
affairs
of
and
little
cared
we
as
our
white
boat
bore
us
southward
on
the
bosom
of
the
sacred
river
little
cared
we
for
the
of
the
great
enchantress
pupil
of
magician
thoth
fair
isis
in
whose
honour
that
boat
was
named
her
tragic
journey
along
this
river
whose
stream
she
could
augment
by
one
sacred
tear
should
have
been
followed
by
our
fancy
we
should
have
seen
with
our
minds
eyes
the
lovely
lady
asking
news
of
the
painted
boat
which
carried
the
dead
body
of
her
murdered
husband
osiris
asking
always
vainly
until
she
thought
of
questioning
the
little
children
but
instead
we
thought
of
our
own
and
amusements
we
played
bridge
and
danced
the
tango
on
deck
we
drummed
on
the
piano
or
warbled
the
latest
musical
comedy
airs
above
all
we
flirted
or
gossiped
about
those
who
flirted
if
for
any
reason
we
were
off
the
active
list
of
flirters
ourselves
to
be
sure
we
had
brought
learned
books
and
took
pains
to
leave
them
in
our
chairs
open
at
marked
passages
of
deep
interest
to
students
we
even
scribbled
heterogeneous
notes
if
for
a
moment
there
were
nothing
more
amusing
to
do
and
bits
of
paper
scampered
wildly
about
the
deck
informing
those
who
retrieved
them
that
nub
was
ancient
egyptian
for
gold
that
osiris
created
men
and
women
from
the
tears
he
wept
over
his
own
body
cut
in
pieces
by
set
that
the
ivy
was
his
favourite
plant
or
that
scarabeus
was
the
greek
word
for
a
beetle
which
created
itself
from
itself
becoming
the
symbol
of
eternal
life
all
this
however
was
affectation
each
hoped
others
might
think
that
he
or
she
was
not
an
ordinary
tourist
each
wished
to
pose
as
a
devotee
of
some
phase
of
history
concerning
gods
temples
or
portrait
statues
anything
not
difficult
to
study
up
but
life
was
too
strong
for
us
the
colour
and
glamour
of
the
nile
got
into
our
blood
hathor
goddess
of
love
bewitched
us
into
doing
queer
things
which
we
should
not
have
dreamed
of
doing
if
we
had
drunk
nile
champagne
yet
after
all
what
did
it
matter
we
were
absorbing
what
our
hearts
if
not
our
minds
called
out
for
the
enchantment
of
egypt
more
or
less
conscientiously
i
performed
the
duties
sir
marcus
lark
had
bribed
me
to
perform
i
gave
neat
little
lectures
and
tried
to
remind
people
whether
they
liked
it
or
not
that
almost
every
moment
the
boat
was
taking
us
past
places
of
astonishing
interest
the
tombs
of
beni
hasan
the
stopped
for
us
to
see
in
order
that
we
might
admire
in
rock
chambers
and
gabble
about
queen
hatasu
or
king
seti
and
his
mother
pakhet
the
beautiful
lady
of
the
speos
but
it
was
difficult
to
rouse
emotion
concerning
things
which
we
glided
by
without
visiting
ruined
temples
were
everywhere
thick
as
flies
as
i
heard
harry
snell
say
to
enid
biddell
but
why
bother
about
them
when
finer
ones
were
waiting
further
down
on
the
of
the
especially
when
there
was
a
pretty
girl
to
walk
the
deck
with
meanwhile
as
for
tell
the
heretic
king
great
city
the
general
vote
went
against
a
visit
to
the
ruins
antoun
effendi
praised
it
as
one
of
the
most
interesting
places
near
the
nile
because
with
the
exception
of
queen
hatasu
and
rameses
the
great
iv
was
the
most
human
personality
in
egyptian
history
but
only
monny
who
was
making
a
hero
of
aknator
really
wished
to
delay
at
the
disc
worshipper
utopia
it
must
have
seemed
strange
to
the
gilded
rose
not
to
have
her
will
prevail
but
there
was
a
clique
on
board
who
appeared
to
find
pleasure
in
thwarting
monny
her
sacrifice
to
the
harlows
was
misunderstood
she
had
made
it
said
those
who
did
not
like
her
in
order
to
gain
credit
for
unselfishness
or
to
have
an
excuse
for
displaying
herself
to
the
public
bath
in
a
dream
of
a
and
a
vision
of
a
cap
carrying
a
poem
of
a
sponge
bag
rachel
guest
was
still
mysteriously
more
popular
than
monny
and
was
said
to
have
had
two
proposals
on
the
first
day
she
did
want
to
get
off
the
boat
to
see
irrelevant
painted
pavements
in
the
harem
of
aknaton
royal
palace
and
her
laziness
won
when
the
vote
was
taken
but
what
did
anything
matter
if
the
glamour
of
the
nile
was
in
our
blood
not
one
of
us
but
thrilled
to
the
droning
cry
of
the
shadoof
men
on
the
brown
banks
as
the
dripping
water
jars
went
up
and
up
tier
after
tier
above
the
river
level
not
one
but
felt
a
strange
allurement
in
the
passing
scene
the
dark
mystery
of
palm
groves
whose
slender
stems
were
prison
bars
against
the
shining
sky
the
copper
glow
of
the
in
villages
the
colour
of
the
flowing
water
where
secret
gleams
as
from
flooded
gold
mines
seemed
to
glint
through
masses
of
dead
violets
that
floated
with
the
tide
no
eye
so
dull
that
it
could
not
see
how
the
shadows
on
land
and
water
were
painted
at
evening
with
a
blue
glaze
like
the
bloom
on
old
scarabs
and
mummy
beads
and
broken
bits
of
pottery
that
art
can
not
copy
now
in
her
way
even
miss
felt
the
charm
of
the
nile
and
its
shores
of
brown
and
emerald
and
i
do
call
it
she
explained
except
when
the
light
is
different
or
there
some
green
stuff
for
cattle
growing
on
the
banks
the
same
and
nothing
happens
but
palms
and
mud
villages
and
shadoofs
and
a
few
arabs
or
camels
or
those
ugly
water
buffaloes
they
say
the
devil
made
to
show
what
he
could
do
but
the
funny
thing
is
you
ca
bear
to
shut
your
eyes
for
a
single
minute
for
fear
of
missing
a
tree
or
a
mound
or
one
of
those
gyassas
loaded
with
white
and
pink
pottery
they
all
seem
so
ridiculously
somehow
then
there
that
bothersome
north
wind
following
you
and
trying
to
freeze
your
spine
unless
you
pounce
on
the
best
seat
where
it
ca
reach
if
you
put
on
your
fur
coat
you
too
hot
if
you
do
you
too
cold
at
night
your
bed
creaks
and
so
does
everybody
else
you
hear
a
creaking
all
down
the
line
when
people
turn
over
which
gets
on
your
nerves
but
you
soon
forget
and
the
whole
experience
is
so
perfectly
wonderful
that
i
like
to
spend
the
rest
of
my
natural
life
going
up
and
down
on
a
nile
boat
through
the
opalescent
dream
of
these
first
days
and
nights
shot
the
fiery
thought
of
our
mission
in
asiut
i
had
been
surprised
at
first
that
anthony
who
knew
so
well
the
dangers
and
mysteries
of
the
east
encouraged
miss
gilder
to
meddle
in
so
delicate
an
affair
and
there
had
never
been
any
explanations
between
us
but
i
told
myself
that
his
motive
was
sympathy
with
monny
desire
to
help
or
else
he
had
been
tempted
to
associate
himself
with
her
in
an
adventure
where
again
as
once
or
twice
before
he
had
been
able
to
win
her
gratitude
perhaps
both
motives
combined
as
for
east
she
frankly
sulked
intuition
told
me
that
she
had
never
dared
speak
to
antoun
effendi
about
the
proposal
in
hieroglyphics
so
difficult
for
me
to
explain
which
she
attributed
to
him
never
had
she
dared
say
you
have
written
me
a
love
letter
why
do
you
follow
it
up
and
give
me
a
chance
to
answer
it
one
way
or
the
other
but
it
was
puzzling
her
disappointing
her
if
not
breaking
her
heart
that
he
avoided
rather
than
sought
her
on
this
glorified
houseboat
where
the
egyptian
prince
was
more
or
less
a
hero
with
romantic
women
while
we
four
planned
in
thrilling
whispers
how
to
rescue
the
ship
mystery
and
rachel
guest
walked
the
deck
with
bill
bailey
or
harry
snell
cleopatra
was
reduced
to
writing
picture
i
thought
if
sir
marcus
had
but
the
inspiration
to
reappear
at
some
stopping
place
farther
on
she
might
be
ready
to
forgive
him
the
false
lotus
flowers
and
perhaps
he
would
come
for
the
lark
type
is
as
difficult
to
snub
as
cleopatra
needle
i
was
half
inclined
to
send
him
a
telegram
on
some
excuse
or
other
we
came
to
asiut
in
the
morning
and
it
was
to
be
a
long
stop
for
there
was
much
to
see
and
every
one
was
excited
at
the
thought
of
our
first
nile
town
a
town
already
of
upper
egypt
which
made
it
seem
that
we
had
come
a
tremendous
way
from
cairo
for
us
egypt
existed
no
longer
as
a
country
but
as
a
golden
brown
and
a
flowing
stream
of
history
on
which
we
floated
so
it
was
fun
for
those
having
no
special
mission
to
feel
that
once
again
bazaars
and
more
or
less
sophisticated
sights
awaited
their
pleasure
i
had
given
my
lecture
the
night
before
trying
to
behave
as
if
i
were
not
boiling
with
emotion
and
had
told
those
who
deigned
to
listen
that
asiut
city
of
the
wolves
was
the
capital
of
a
province
i
had
babbled
too
about
the
tombs
which
tourists
must
see
even
if
they
hurry
over
the
inspection
of
carvings
cartouches
and
representations
of
very
small
queens
smelling
very
large
lotuses
most
egyptian
queens
apparently
spent
much
of
their
time
lightly
clothed
and
smelling
lotuses
a
ladylike
pursuit
for
those
about
to
have
their
portraits
taken
in
order
to
find
time
for
the
mummied
cats
the
bazaars
the
silver
scarves
the
red
and
black
pottery
and
the
images
of
wolves
crocodiles
and
camels
cheap
enough
to
be
freely
bought
for
poor
relations
at
home
antoun
and
i
hinted
at
business
which
must
prevent
our
joining
the
sightseers
who
would
be
chaperoned
by
the
dragoman
luckily
they
got
the
idea
into
their
heads
that
our
affairs
were
connected
with
sir
marcus
and
the
trip
we
were
pitied
rather
than
blamed
but
our
real
difficulty
was
with
east
as
monny
did
not
wish
cleopatra
to
be
let
into
the
secret
if
she
knew
she
would
want
to
be
in
the
adventure
and
in
monny
opinion
aunt
clara
was
a
dear
but
unfitted
for
adventures
we
planned
that
brigit
and
monny
should
call
upon
the
wife
of
rechid
bey
whose
house
would
be
easy
to
find
if
they
were
admitted
they
would
try
to
bring
her
out
as
if
for
a
drive
for
it
seemed
a
case
of
now
or
never
if
she
were
to
escape
in
case
she
were
able
to
come
they
would
take
her
straight
to
the
american
consulate
which
i
was
to
visit
meanwhile
in
order
to
explain
matters
but
if
the
rescuers
were
refused
admission
the
consul
must
be
entreated
to
give
active
help
i
as
a
diplomat
was
considered
a
suitable
person
to
deal
with
this
side
of
the
affair
and
antoun
effendi
was
to
keep
unobtrusive
guard
within
sight
of
rechid
house
until
brigit
and
monny
with
or
without
a
companion
should
come
forth
safely
as
i
said
however
the
difficulty
was
east
she
would
expect
her
niece
if
not
brigit
to
go
about
with
her
and
would
not
be
easily
persuaded
to
join
any
other
party
as
for
rachel
we
need
not
think
of
her
as
she
had
been
annexed
by
the
biddells
who
would
otherwise
have
lost
harry
snell
but
cleopatra
what
to
do
with
cleopatra
it
was
anthony
who
had
an
inspiration
there
lived
near
asiut
it
seemed
an
italian
who
bred
sicilian
said
to
be
like
those
which
had
been
favourite
pets
in
the
day
of
cleopatra
the
great
indeed
antony
was
supposed
to
have
given
one
to
the
queen
now
fenton
asked
permission
to
present
a
sicilian
to
east
a
dog
so
small
so
polite
that
he
could
be
taken
anywhere
anthony
could
not
go
himself
to
select
the
gift
but
would
find
an
interpreter
as
a
guide
to
the
kennel
and
bring
her
back
to
the
exploring
party
cleopatra
delighted
with
her
hero
thoughtfulness
caught
at
the
idea
and
when
the
set
went
tearing
furiously
away
in
arabeahs
or
on
donkeys
east
followed
sedately
in
a
carriage
with
the
elderly
greek
interpreter
and
miss
who
also
fancied
the
idea
of
a
sicilian
to
replace
the
lamented
marmoset
everything
glittered
at
asiut
the
sun
glittered
on
the
water
palm
trees
in
gardens
glittered
as
the
wind
waved
their
big
green
fans
the
white
or
pink
facades
of
large
square
houses
glittered
those
fine
houses
along
the
nile
in
one
of
which
rechid
bey
was
known
to
live
but
brighter
than
all
glittered
the
silver
scarfs
which
arabs
begged
us
to
buy
hanging
over
arms
raised
to
show
them
off
the
shining
folds
glittered
like
cascades
of
running
water
in
moonlight
very
cheap
very
beautiful
cried
the
merchants
ladies
see
here
your
they
buy
for
you
in
spite
of
antoun
dignified
refusals
putting
the
men
off
till
our
return
they
ran
after
us
waving
scarfs
and
shawls
and
robes
white
as
scintillating
hoarfrost
pink
as
palest
roses
purple
as
sunset
clouds
green
and
golden
as
nile
water
or
sequined
black
as
a
night
of
stars
their
vendors
feared
that
if
we
did
not
buy
of
them
others
might
beguile
us
and
saw
danger
ahead
in
a
distant
group
of
rivals
crowding
round
some
tourists
from
another
boat
this
group
we
had
to
pass
and
as
we
did
so
who
should
break
out
from
the
glittering
ring
but
bedr
he
came
toward
us
humble
and
cringing
giving
the
beautiful
arab
salute
dear
and
ladies
he
exclaimed
i
am
very
happy
to
see
you
again
wo
you
shake
hands
to
forgive
because
i
meaned
no
harm
and
did
no
wrong
thing
but
obey
the
sweet
ladies
wish
when
they
would
go
to
that
house
of
the
crocodile
i
too
much
punished
when
i
been
sent
away
that
past
now
and
forgotten
said
monny
shrinking
slightly
from
the
outstretched
hand
perhaps
it
was
your
fault
that
trouble
we
got
into
but
we
did
need
you
afterward
anyhow
and
probably
the
people
you
are
with
now
are
nicer
to
you
than
we
were
oh
no
peoples
could
be
nicer
though
they
are
very
nice
my
two
you
seed
with
me
in
the
desert
they
travel
with
me
yet
we
go
everywhere
by
trains
because
it
takes
not
so
much
time
as
the
boats
and
miss
guest
that
nice
good
young
lady
is
she
well
yes
she
is
very
well
replied
miss
gilder
beginning
to
be
restless
her
eyes
avoiding
bedr
face
as
had
been
her
habit
when
the
man
was
in
our
employ
she
did
not
like
to
hurt
his
feelings
monny
ca
bear
to
hurt
the
feelings
of
any
one
below
herself
in
wealth
or
station
though
apparently
she
does
consider
that
one
is
bound
to
be
with
the
rich
but
i
could
see
that
she
wanted
to
escape
never
had
she
liked
bedr
he
had
been
rachel
man
from
the
first
miss
guest
has
gone
to
see
the
tombs
monny
explained
you
not
go
there
and
to
the
bazaars
i
take
my
in
a
few
minutes
we
shall
go
by
and
by
just
now
we
other
things
to
do
said
the
girl
evasively
rather
too
evasively
perhaps
but
in
the
hope
of
killing
two
birds
with
one
stone
luring
the
man
to
betray
his
secret
if
he
had
one
and
then
shunting
him
i
broke
in
how
have
you
been
getting
on
i
inquired
looking
into
the
squint
eyes
since
that
night
i
saw
you
at
but
the
eyes
opened
wide
with
a
stare
of
innocence
you
see
there
milord
i
thought
your
party
had
not
come
when
we
went
away
my
not
like
that
camping
place
and
we
stay
there
not
even
one
night
you
must
make
mistake
and
think
some
other
man
me
sure
we
could
not
help
laughing
at
the
sure
it
was
spoken
in
so
truly
an
american
way
that
it
was
funny
on
those
lips
afterward
however
it
struck
me
in
remembering
the
scene
that
the
man
accent
in
speaking
english
was
even
more
distinctly
american
than
it
had
been
this
was
odd
if
he
had
been
associating
with
germans
but
natural
if
his
new
clients
were
americans
another
question
was
on
my
tongue
but
before
i
had
time
to
speak
monny
cried
out
oh
there
wretched
bey
in
a
carriage
all
alone
with
some
luggage
i
hope
he
going
away
naturally
we
turned
but
i
saw
biddy
raise
her
eyebrows
warningly
the
girl
looked
puzzled
as
if
for
an
instant
she
did
not
see
what
she
had
done
that
was
wrong
but
i
guess
that
biddy
distrust
of
bedr
as
a
possible
spy
was
still
alive
in
her
breast
she
did
not
know
of
my
suspicions
concerning
the
camp
thief
for
the
affair
at
medinet
thanks
to
a
white
fib
or
two
had
never
assumed
serious
proportions
in
her
mind
it
did
not
need
that
however
to
make
her
feel
that
ears
were
not
fit
receptacles
for
secrets
monny
had
not
been
mistaken
it
was
rechid
bey
leaning
comfortably
back
in
an
but
not
badly
appointed
open
carriage
drawn
by
two
very
decent
horses
and
driven
by
a
smart
negro
we
saw
him
in
profile
as
he
passed
along
the
road
at
some
distance
but
he
was
reading
a
paper
with
an
expression
so
placid
that
i
felt
sure
he
had
not
seen
us
on
the
seat
beside
him
was
a
suitcase
with
the
air
of
having
been
made
in
france
and
circumstantial
evidence
said
that
monny
wish
was
to
be
granted
i
glanced
hastily
at
bedr
to
observe
if
i
could
whether
the
impulsive
exclamation
had
aroused
undue
interest
for
it
was
not
unlikely
that
he
had
seen
rechid
bey
and
mabel
landing
at
alexandria
the
night
of
his
first
meeting
with
us
but
the
ugly
face
showed
nothing
if
you
have
things
you
want
to
do
my
ladies
he
said
please
excuse
that
i
have
keeped
you
i
go
to
my
or
they
give
the
men
with
the
silver
shawls
too
much
money
the
in
question
were
more
interested
in
observing
our
movements
than
in
completing
any
bargain
with
the
street
vendors
nevertheless
bedr
hastened
back
as
if
in
great
fear
that
they
might
be
cheated
an
arabeah
waited
for
them
and
having
bought
a
scarf
or
two
they
drove
off
before
we
had
parted
to
go
our
several
ways
an
arabeah
was
in
attendance
upon
us
also
and
we
put
brigit
and
monny
into
it
alone
for
rechid
bey
house
the
driver
informed
us
was
not
far
off
good
luck
i
said
encouragingly
and
brigit
smiled
gayly
at
me
but
monny
was
looking
at
fenton
she
was
telling
him
something
with
her
eyes
and
with
a
significant
little
gesture
she
touched
the
small
leather
handbag
she
carried
one
would
think
she
was
a
suffragette
with
a
bomb
i
remarked
to
anthony
trying
to
speak
easily
as
though
i
were
not
at
all
anxious
when
the
carriage
had
turned
its
back
on
us
instead
of
which
said
anthony
gazing
at
the
dark
head
and
the
fair
head
as
earnestly
as
if
he
never
expected
to
see
them
again
instead
of
which
she
merely
a
brave
girl
with
a
pistol
that
she
knows
how
to
use
or
anyhow
she
says
she
does
great
heavens
has
she
got
one
in
that
bag
i
gasped
she
has
my
browning
jove
you
gave
it
to
her
i
did
last
night
my
heart
began
suddenly
to
feel
like
a
cannon
ball
in
my
breast
i
felt
that
i
had
not
understood
the
situation
and
that
now
i
did
not
understand
anthony
though
that
was
far
from
being
a
new
sensation
i
thought
that
thought
there
was
no
danger
i
bleated
you
know
egypt
and
i
do
i
did
want
them
to
go
in
for
this
thing
but
when
you
said
it
would
be
all
right
i
yielded
i
wish
to
heaven
i
had
do
you
think
if
you
had
given
in
miss
gilder
would
have
given
up
you
and
i
together
could
have
kept
them
both
out
of
the
business
only
by
sheer
force
you
see
miss
gilder
was
interested
in
this
girl
and
fond
of
her
before
she
met
you
so
was
east
as
rechid
tricked
the
pretty
little
governess
by
making
her
believe
she
would
be
his
first
and
only
wife
they
do
look
upon
her
as
married
to
him
and
i
think
they
right
do
you
glory
in
them
both
for
knowing
there
a
risk
yet
taking
it
so
gayly
for
that
foolish
child
sake
i
glory
in
them
but
i
would
have
let
them
go
if
you
changed
your
mind
just
because
i
gave
miss
gilder
my
browning
honestly
duffer
i
do
think
there
actual
danger
but
anyhow
do
you
see
they
to
go
and
they
had
to
go
alone
they
would
have
hated
us
and
themselves
and
each
other
if
they
had
answered
the
girl
appeal
and
could
do
the
thing
unfortunately
as
it
deals
with
the
harem
if
it
can
be
done
at
all
it
woman
business
these
two
are
the
right
ones
as
they
felt
bound
to
do
it
and
you
and
i
can
but
see
them
through
from
the
outside
chapter
xix
if
at
first
you
do
succeed
now
that
we
were
thoroughly
launched
on
this
somewhat
quixotic
adventure
i
envied
anthony
because
his
part
in
the
drama
kept
him
in
the
wings
within
sight
of
the
stage
he
was
to
watch
the
house
of
rechid
bey
and
if
the
rescue
party
of
two
did
not
appear
after
an
hour
absence
the
true
story
of
the
affair
and
mabel
appeal
was
to
be
laid
before
the
inspector
general
of
upper
egypt
laid
before
him
not
by
ahmed
antoun
effendi
but
by
captain
anthony
fenton
officially
on
leave
secretly
on
a
special
mission
for
the
british
government
my
rôle
less
exciting
but
perhaps
no
less
important
was
to
play
the
diplomat
in
beguiling
the
american
consul
to
stand
by
the
wife
of
rechid
bey
if
the
attempt
at
rescue
succeeded
or
if
possible
even
if
it
failed
antoun
accounted
for
his
presence
in
front
of
rechid
bey
high
garden
wall
by
attracting
a
crowd
and
lecturing
them
in
his
character
of
hadji
while
i
dashed
off
in
a
jingling
arabeah
to
the
american
consulate
as
in
cairo
my
progress
was
one
long
adjuration
of
the
crowd
by
the
driver
who
would
have
revelled
in
conducting
the
car
of
juggernaut
shemalak
ya
welad
to
the
left
oh
boy
or
yeminick
to
the
right
he
roared
while
men
dived
and
dipped
under
his
prancing
feet
a
hawk
flew
by
on
my
right
side
and
my
right
eyelid
twitched
as
we
neared
the
consulate
in
egypt
these
were
good
omens
besides
there
had
been
a
red
sunrise
which
in
the
nile
country
had
meant
since
egyptians
superseded
the
prehistoric
new
race
that
rã
had
conquered
his
enemies
and
stained
the
sky
with
their
blood
therefore
all
should
be
well
with
me
and
the
world
and
it
did
seem
as
if
my
hopes
bade
fair
to
be
fulfilled
when
in
the
consul
i
recognized
a
man
i
had
been
able
to
advise
in
a
small
official
difficulty
in
my
early
days
at
the
embassy
in
rome
this
was
even
more
fortunate
than
the
case
of
slaney
we
shook
hands
warmly
and
as
soon
as
was
decent
i
interrupted
a
flow
of
reminiscent
gratitude
by
flooding
james
bronson
with
the
story
of
rechid
bey
unhappy
american
bride
mabella
hânem
ill
treated
as
well
as
cruelly
deceived
if
her
story
were
true
he
knew
rechid
slightly
but
the
marriage
was
news
to
him
with
interest
he
listened
to
my
account
of
the
lonely
little
governess
in
paris
bewitched
by
the
of
a
handsome
turk
as
white
as
herself
but
when
i
asked
for
help
the
consul
shook
his
head
lord
ernest
he
said
there
nothing
i
like
better
than
to
pay
my
debt
by
doing
you
some
favour
but
you
asking
me
the
one
thing
that
hardest
as
you
probably
know
you
understand
as
well
as
i
do
that
when
a
girl
marries
a
man
she
ceases
to
be
a
subject
of
her
native
land
and
to
interfere
with
the
inmate
of
a
harem
is
just
about
impossible
but
i
tell
you
what
i
will
do
for
your
sake
if
you
can
get
the
girl
out
of
rechid
bey
house
which
mind
you
i
doubt
you
may
bring
her
to
my
wife
and
we
cook
up
some
story
about
her
being
a
relative
of
mine
so
she
is
i
guess
through
adam
and
eve
if
you
think
she
been
badly
treated
we
stand
by
her
once
she
under
this
roof
which
means
she
be
on
american
soil
through
thick
and
thin
whatever
the
consequences
i
ca
go
farther
and
i
believe
you
expected
that
i
would
i
admitted
that
i
had
not
and
thanked
him
for
his
promise
by
this
time
i
thought
that
brigit
and
monny
might
be
on
their
way
to
meet
me
at
the
consulate
as
arranged
escorted
by
antoun
and
perhaps
bringing
mabel
even
the
route
they
were
to
take
was
planned
so
that
i
could
not
miss
them
if
i
started
meanwhile
bronson
was
to
interest
his
wife
in
our
protégée
back
i
flew
my
ears
deafened
by
more
ya
welads
but
though
i
met
many
things
and
many
creatures
on
the
congested
road
there
was
no
arabeah
containing
the
desired
ones
i
made
my
driver
slacken
pace
as
we
neared
the
big
square
pink
house
of
rechid
bey
set
far
back
in
its
garden
of
palms
and
impossible
statues
on
the
bank
of
the
nile
no
green
turban
was
in
sight
and
i
wondered
what
could
have
happened
as
we
drove
slowly
past
the
ponderous
black
apparently
half
asleep
on
his
bench
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
crawl
along
at
a
snail
pace
lest
that
droop
of
the
should
be
assumed
for
effect
i
went
on
meaning
to
turn
presently
but
when
the
arabeah
had
taken
me
beyond
eyeshot
of
rechid
an
arab
sacca
or
water
seller
ran
forward
striking
his
musical
gong
from
his
brass
jar
protected
by
horse
hair
to
keep
out
dust
he
offered
a
draught
and
his
look
said
that
he
had
something
more
for
me
than
a
drink
of
water
i
beckoned
him
close
stopping
the
arabeah
and
under
the
tumbler
he
handed
up
was
a
folded
bit
of
paper
none
save
the
water
seller
had
attention
to
spare
for
me
just
then
as
a
wedding
procession
was
approaching
with
a
crude
but
gorgeous
curtained
litter
drawn
by
camels
and
a
number
of
musicians
with
räitas
darabukas
the
key
and
bottle
and
other
eastern
instruments
which
may
have
been
ancestors
of
the
highlanders
bagpipes
the
street
crowd
followed
enchanted
by
the
plaintive
monotonous
notes
grotesque
to
newcomers
from
the
west
but
enthralling
to
those
who
have
fallen
under
the
spell
of
their
melancholy
magic
failure
for
the
present
but
miss
and
safe
anthony
had
scrawled
in
pencil
could
wait
in
front
of
house
but
find
us
at
an
arab
restaurant
to
which
the
messenger
will
guide
you
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
discharge
your
arabeah
and
walk
in
the
direction
the
man
takes
keeping
your
distance
in
case
you
watched
i
obeyed
instructions
and
in
the
town
of
asiut
far
from
the
gardens
along
the
nile
front
i
came
to
a
house
between
the
mosque
of
the
tallest
minaret
and
the
great
market
whither
arabia
as
well
as
egypt
sends
her
wares
it
was
a
house
of
some
pretension
though
in
a
narrow
unpaved
street
lined
with
humble
native
dwellings
i
guessed
that
it
must
have
been
built
for
a
rich
man
who
had
died
or
failed
in
business
but
now
a
sign
in
arabic
announced
that
it
was
a
restaurant
a
nod
from
the
water
seller
told
that
i
had
reached
the
end
of
the
journey
nubian
servants
salaamed
in
the
big
room
where
once
the
master
of
the
house
had
held
receptions
and
in
a
smaller
room
beyond
i
saw
antoun
brigit
and
monny
they
were
seated
at
a
low
table
where
no
forks
or
knives
or
even
plates
were
laid
in
the
centre
of
the
white
cloth
stood
a
large
dish
of
something
sweet
and
from
which
everybody
pretended
to
eat
but
at
sight
of
me
brigit
and
monny
began
talking
together
they
told
me
breathlessly
how
they
had
been
informed
by
the
gatekeeper
that
mabella
hânem
was
not
well
having
insisted
that
they
were
intimate
friends
whom
she
would
desire
to
see
they
had
been
bidden
to
return
in
an
hour
reluctantly
coming
away
they
had
as
soon
as
was
prudent
been
joined
by
antoun
he
had
then
taken
them
to
the
bazaars
hoping
to
give
them
a
glimpse
of
the
shops
before
the
set
returned
from
the
tombs
but
they
had
met
neill
sheridan
who
had
something
to
tell
he
had
caught
sight
of
bedr
running
after
the
carriage
of
a
turk
strongly
resembling
rechid
bey
the
carriage
had
stopped
near
the
railway
station
and
after
an
instant
conversation
the
horses
had
been
turned
to
gallop
off
in
the
direction
whence
they
had
come
of
course
we
were
sure
the
turk
rechid
said
monny
so
antoun
effendi
thought
we
better
go
back
to
watch
his
house
when
we
got
there
it
was
too
late
for
already
some
time
had
passed
since
sheridan
saw
bedr
rechid
said
that
mabella
hânem
was
suddenly
better
and
had
gone
away
with
her
husband
he
could
talk
a
little
french
so
we
understood
perfectly
and
anyhow
you
know
studying
arabic
it
discouraging
when
arabs
answer
me
in
cockney
english
or
say
sure
in
american
we
believed
the
fellow
because
it
seemed
exactly
what
wretched
do
come
back
and
grab
mabel
away
at
a
minute
notice
so
unfortunate
about
neill
sheridan
wretched
was
idiotically
jealous
of
him
on
the
and
if
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
him
he
certain
to
think
sheridan
here
to
try
and
see
mabel
we
tore
to
the
railroad
depot
but
the
train
was
just
going
out
no
doubt
rechid
and
his
wife
were
both
on
it
is
it
heartbreaking
i
sat
mute
thinking
things
over
but
anthony
tried
to
give
consolation
by
saying
that
he
still
had
some
hope
he
had
found
out
that
rechid
bey
owned
a
sugar
plantation
with
a
house
on
it
near
luxor
the
train
which
had
left
asiut
was
bound
for
luxor
in
a
very
few
days
our
boat
would
land
us
there
and
we
would
try
our
luck
again
not
much
doubt
fenton
added
speaking
as
always
in
french
that
this
is
bedr
revenge
on
us
he
must
have
told
rechid
that
miss
gilder
had
mentioned
his
name
saying
she
hoped
he
was
leaving
home
that
hint
of
danger
would
be
enough
for
any
turk
it
will
be
my
fault
then
moaned
monny
if
he
kills
mabel
deceived
and
shut
her
up
and
tried
to
convert
her
worse
than
all
he
has
another
wife
the
next
step
will
be
murder
oh
how
can
we
bear
the
delay
of
going
on
to
luxor
by
boat
had
we
better
take
a
train
better
miss
all
the
things
we
come
to
egypt
to
see
rather
than
leave
mabel
to
her
fate
rechid
is
the
sort
to
have
her
put
out
of
the
way
said
anthony
he
not
a
bad
fellow
as
such
men
go
and
he
hardly
had
time
to
tire
of
his
conquest
yet
according
to
his
lights
he
right
not
to
allow
any
interference
with
his
harem
from
europeans
he
was
jealous
on
board
ship
of
one
or
two
men
of
your
acquaintance
you
told
me
this
attempted
visit
of
yours
will
revive
his
interest
in
his
wife
inconveniently
for
us
but
if
i
know
his
type
it
will
die
down
again
the
minute
he
thinks
he
has
covered
his
tracks
for
a
day
or
two
he
will
be
a
dragon
then
he
begin
to
think
we
discouraged
or
that
we
have
found
out
about
his
sugar
plantation
or
that
nothing
more
than
a
visit
to
his
wife
was
intended
and
he
turn
his
attention
to
other
things
than
it
far
better
to
go
on
by
boat
and
make
a
dash
when
he
off
guard
again
after
a
few
arguments
we
agreed
with
antoun
as
we
usually
ended
by
doing
and
soothed
our
restlessness
by
visiting
bronson
to
tell
him
of
our
disappointment
if
it
had
been
for
monny
i
think
the
consul
would
have
taken
the
point
of
view
that
he
was
now
out
of
the
affair
but
monny
with
generous
zeal
is
rather
irresistible
fired
by
her
enthusiasm
as
he
had
not
been
by
my
beguiling
he
volunteered
to
go
to
luxor
on
two
or
three
days
leave
with
his
wife
to
visit
a
syrian
friend
who
had
often
vainly
invited
them
to
his
villa
and
arriving
if
possible
about
the
time
our
boat
was
due
if
we
succeeded
in
our
quest
we
might
bring
mabel
to
them
and
they
would
smuggle
her
back
to
the
american
consulate
at
asiut
our
great
adventure
thus
postponed
we
let
the
take
us
once
more
and
though
we
had
moments
of
impatience
the
dream
was
too
fair
to
be
resisted
besides
we
were
all
four
dreaming
it
together
poor
cleopatra
was
the
only
one
outside
for
rachel
guest
was
dreaming
her
own
dream
with
an
extremely
practical
side
to
it
unless
biddy
and
i
were
mistaken
she
wore
monny
clothes
and
used
her
special
perfume
and
took
advantage
of
the
same
initials
to
accept
gifts
of
filmy
handkerchiefs
and
monogrammed
bags
and
brushes
also
she
had
firmly
annexed
most
of
the
men
on
board
who
would
in
normal
states
of
mind
have
belonged
to
the
gilded
rose
but
they
all
seemed
to
have
gone
mad
on
the
subject
of
miss
guest
even
harry
snell
who
had
been
the
property
of
enid
biddell
on
board
the
on
the
was
gravitating
lured
by
that
meek
mysterious
witchery
which
i
was
trying
hard
to
understand
we
got
past
sohâg
and
the
famous
white
and
red
coptic
monasteries
built
by
saint
helena
without
jarring
notes
of
any
sort
in
the
save
for
the
failure
of
our
rescue
plot
past
akhmin
which
herodotus
wrote
of
as
chemmis
past
girgah
where
once
stood
ancient
this
that
gave
the
first
dynasty
of
kings
to
egypt
but
when
we
arrived
at
baliana
to
visit
abydos
between
enid
biddell
and
harry
snell
i
had
an
interlude
of
nightmare
it
was
rachel
fault
but
it
was
i
who
had
to
suffer
for
her
sins
i
who
had
engaged
as
conductor
of
the
set
and
found
myself
their
arbiter
as
well
other
tourists
on
other
boats
do
not
see
abydos
until
the
return
trip
but
the
aim
of
sir
marcus
was
originality
as
well
as
exclusiveness
this
was
a
special
tour
and
everything
we
were
to
do
must
be
special
some
passengers
might
wish
to
stay
longer
than
others
at
khartum
or
from
there
go
up
the
white
or
blue
nile
after
big
game
or
they
might
tire
of
the
nile
and
wish
to
tear
back
to
cairo
by
train
sir
marcus
was
boldly
outdoing
his
rivals
by
allowing
clients
to
engage
cabins
for
up
nile
only
instead
of
paying
the
return
also
and
they
were
not
to
miss
any
temple
because
of
this
concession
i
consider
it
an
advertisement
and
a
cheap
one
he
had
explained
to
me
in
saying
that
we
were
to
visit
at
abydos
on
our
way
south
beautiful
smiling
donkeys
adorned
with
beads
and
amulets
met
us
at
the
we
ought
to
have
called
it
but
we
did
we
called
it
baliana
and
we
pronounced
abydos
according
to
our
education
we
had
a
ride
of
an
hour
and
a
half
from
the
boat
to
the
temple
and
having
sent
off
cleopatra
and
lady
biddell
in
a
carriage
my
conscience
was
free
my
heart
light
the
sun
shone
on
tawny
desert
hills
like
lions
creeping
stealthily
out
from
the
horizon
toward
the
nile
to
drink
there
were
sweet
smells
of
unseen
flowers
and
herbs
such
as
ancient
egyptian
doctors
used
and
i
looked
forward
to
keeping
my
donkey
near
biddy
of
course
i
ought
to
have
preferred
monny
but
then
i
could
talk
of
monny
to
biddy
and
we
had
had
so
many
subjects
in
common
since
childhood
that
it
was
restful
to
ride
even
the
most
energetic
donkey
at
the
side
of
mrs
jones
no
sooner
however
had
i
begun
to
urge
my
gray
animal
after
her
white
one
than
i
was
called
by
enid
biddell
oh
lord
ernest
i
speak
to
you
she
pleaded
so
piteously
that
i
could
pretend
not
to
hear
when
we
were
ambling
side
by
side
separated
from
the
rest
of
the
party
by
a
gleaming
cloud
of
copper
dust
a
few
brown
sheep
some
water
buffalo
and
a
plague
of
little
birds
enid
turned
upon
me
a
pair
of
eyes
why
miss
biddell
what
is
the
matter
or
is
it
a
cold
in
your
head
i
asked
anxiously
it
not
a
cold
in
my
head
she
confessed
it
a
dreadful
dreadful
pain
in
my
heart
and
you
the
only
one
who
can
cure
it
for
a
fearful
moment
i
thought
that
she
was
going
to
propose
one
hears
of
these
awful
visitations
but
i
need
not
have
trembled
i
feel
as
if
i
could
say
anything
to
you
she
murmured
you
are
so
understanding
and
so
sympathetic
it
was
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
to
reply
that
it
was
my
duty
as
conductor
to
be
so
and
that
if
i
succeeded
a
mountain
full
of
hidden
treasure
might
perhaps
reward
me
but
just
in
time
i
realized
that
this
speech
would
not
be
tactful
instead
of
speaking
i
looked
at
her
and
let
her
go
on
it
harry
snell
she
said
you
have
influence
with
him
he
thinks
you
such
a
great
swell
he
hate
to
do
anything
you
would
call
unworthy
of
a
gentleman
he
he
making
me
so
unhappy
he
done
everything
to
win
my
love
and
now
now
he
gone
over
to
that
miss
guest
the
donkey
having
begun
inopportunely
to
trot
the
words
were
jolted
out
one
after
another
like
a
shower
of
pebbles
and
they
fell
on
my
feelings
like
paving
stones
she
expected
to
do
something
about
it
horrible
i
should
almost
have
preferred
the
proposal
my
dear
miss
biddell
i
soothed
her
in
my
best
voice
cultivated
at
the
embassy
you
are
much
prettier
than
miss
guest
and
you
can
win
snell
back
easily
if
you
want
him
probably
he
only
flirting
to
make
you
jealous
it
me
he
was
flirting
with
she
moaned
but
i
believe
he
cares
for
miss
guest
it
only
a
case
of
my
leader
because
other
men
like
her
so
much
nothing
succeeds
like
success
you
know
and
other
men
admiration
is
the
most
becoming
background
a
girl
can
have
he
told
harlow
it
was
haunting
him
that
elaine
and
i
would
get
fat
like
our
mother
and
the
men
who
married
us
would
have
to
spend
dull
years
seeing
us
slowly
grow
into
mother
likeness
was
it
cruel
and
we
eat
scarcely
except
pickles
on
purpose
to
keep
thin
but
that
only
his
excuse
it
the
romance
of
the
situation
and
the
that
appeals
to
him
what
secret
i
felt
entitled
to
inquire
why
the
secret
between
those
two
girls
miss
gilder
and
miss
guest
you
what
all
the
men
believe
about
them
do
you
but
of
course
you
do
but
of
course
i
do
why
that
they
changed
places
to
deceive
people
just
as
heiresses
and
poor
girls
do
in
plays
or
books
they
think
miss
gilder
i
mean
the
girl
we
miss
gilder
is
really
the
and
the
one
we
call
miss
guest
and
that
all
the
men
are
after
is
rosamond
gilder
the
cannon
heiress
whew
i
whistled
bumpily
as
my
donkey
kept
up
with
enid
for
goodness
sake
what
makes
them
think
that
i
do
know
exactly
how
the
story
started
but
it
seems
have
you
known
them
long
only
since
naples
but
then
you
ca
be
certain
whether
it
true
or
not
i
paused
swallowing
an
answer
so
was
the
explanation
of
the
monny
puzzle
yet
it
was
but
the
first
word
of
another
enigma
was
responsible
for
the
wild
story
there
was
more
than
met
the
eye
or
ear
in
this
i
could
hardly
believe
that
monny
would
have
chosen
or
rachel
dared
to
start
this
rumour
though
it
might
have
amused
the
real
heiress
and
suited
the
false
one
to
watch
it
run
i
dared
not
contradict
it
flatly
without
consulting
brigit
or
the
gilded
rose
herself
it
was
not
my
business
to
be
a
if
there
were
sport
to
spoil
no
matter
how
sternly
i
might
disapprove
in
the
matter
of
actual
knowledge
i
have
very
little
about
miss
gilder
i
decided
to
reply
except
that
she
charming
enough
and
pretty
enough
for
any
man
to
fall
in
love
with
if
she
had
a
penny
as
for
miss
guest
miss
guest
is
a
cat
and
if
you
tell
harry
snell
so
bless
you
all
my
life
good
gracious
i
could
do
that
i
mean
tell
him
you
think
she
is
the
heiress
that
she
only
what
she
seems
to
be
and
nothing
mysterious
or
interesting
he
believe
why
she
have
any
money
or
even
a
nice
mind
she
always
writes
with
her
finger
on
top
of
her
cold
cream
at
hotels
she
told
me
so
herself
not
that
it
any
good
with
arabs
they
do
want
to
steal
cold
cream
but
such
a
trick
would
never
occur
to
a
rich
girl
would
it
she
grows
vainer
every
day
too
till
one
can
just
see
vanity
spouting
from
the
top
of
her
head
she
intends
to
use
this
mistake
people
are
making
about
her
to
bag
a
rich
man
like
harry
snell
or
a
successful
one
with
a
big
growing
reputation
like
bailey
the
american
sculptor
you
help
me
save
harry
from
her
and
bring
him
back
to
me
wo
you
you
the
only
one
he
listen
to
if
you
do
speak
i
shall
simply
jump
overboard
into
the
nile
and
sir
marcus
lark
would
that
so
should
i
dear
miss
biddell
i
assured
her
but
what
can
i
possibly
do
in
in
such
a
very
intimate
matter
why
you
a
diplomat
are
you
i
thought
they
always
knew
what
to
do
you
make
us
all
dance
to
your
tune
like
puppets
and
imagine
prancing
about
to
please
ourselves
tell
him
he
breaking
my
heart
by
jove
you
not
in
earnest
i
am
oh
he
must
come
back
i
thought
on
board
the
we
were
as
good
as
engaged
i
i
submitted
to
his
kisses
and
now
is
a
good
word
i
sneered
to
my
inner
self
but
outwardly
i
submitted
a
handkerchief
to
the
lady
as
she
had
lost
hers
in
one
of
the
last
donkey
jolts
and
ventured
to
insert
sympathetically
into
a
pause
a
small
suggestion
it
was
usual
i
reminded
miss
biddell
if
a
gentleman
intentions
had
to
be
asked
that
the
father
did
the
asking
this
hint
however
fell
flatter
than
a
flounder
and
all
the
way
to
abydos
most
sacred
temple
of
ancient
egypt
i
was
persecuted
with
enid
biddell
woes
when
i
should
have
been
free
to
meditate
upon
the
tragic
history
of
isis
and
osiris
it
was
here
that
the
head
of
the
murdered
god
was
buried
and
perhaps
his
whole
body
when
the
magic
secret
of
thoth
had
enabled
isis
to
collect
the
fourteen
separate
pieces
set
had
hidden
many
temples
claimed
the
sacred
body
of
osiris
ruler
over
departed
spirits
and
amenti
their
dim
dwelling
place
beyond
the
western
desert
philae
and
memphis
among
others
but
it
was
abydos
to
which
the
egyptians
give
their
most
reverent
faith
as
the
true
burial
place
of
the
beloved
one
it
was
there
they
wished
to
lie
when
they
died
and
were
mummied
in
order
to
rest
through
eternity
near
the
relic
of
their
most
precious
god
thus
a
necropolis
grew
like
a
of
sleep
round
the
temple
and
a
city
rose
also
but
even
in
the
time
of
strabo
the
city
was
reduced
to
a
village
and
all
traces
of
the
shrine
had
vanished
the
great
white
jewel
of
the
temples
temple
of
seti
i
and
the
temple
of
his
son
rameses
ii
remain
to
this
day
however
with
the
tablet
of
ancestors
which
has
helped
in
the
tracing
of
egyptian
history
therefore
is
it
that
this
treasure
of
the
is
still
a
shrine
for
travellers
from
the
four
corners
of
the
earth
after
the
long
straight
road
and
a
high
sudden
hill
we
came
face
to
face
with
the
columns
of
the
outer
court
if
i
had
been
with
brigit
or
monny
i
could
have
run
back
into
the
past
hand
in
hand
with
either
to
see
with
my
mind
eyes
the
white
limestone
palace
of
memnon
copied
from
the
labyrinth
standing
above
the
city
between
the
canal
and
the
desert
i
should
have
peered
into
the
depths
of
its
fountain
and
with
a
hand
shading
my
eyeballs
from
the
sun
i
should
have
gazed
at
the
grove
of
horus
sacred
acanthus
trees
dark
against
the
burning
blue
i
should
have
found
the
royal
tombs
which
rameses
restored
grouped
near
the
buried
body
of
osiris
but
bad
luck
gave
me
enid
biddell
for
my
companion
she
would
not
let
any
one
else
come
near
me
even
had
the
right
somebody
wished
to
dispute
my
battered
remains
with
her
antoun
effendi
had
the
others
hypnotized
and
i
wondered
if
they
noticed
how
like
his
boldly
cut
profile
was
to
certain
portraits
of
the
youthful
rameses
carved
on
the
glittering
white
walls
so
splendid
were
they
that
had
i
been
a
woman
my
spirit
would
have
rushed
back
along
the
devious
paths
of
egypt
history
to
find
and
fall
at
the
feet
of
their
original
but
there
was
antoun
much
easier
to
get
at
and
perhaps
better
worth
the
gift
of
a
heart
than
rameses
the
great
with
all
his
faults
and
cruelties
crowds
of
birds
lived
in
interstices
of
the
broken
columns
and
their
tiny
faces
peeped
out
like
flowers
growing
among
rocks
their
eyes
bright
and
arresting
as
personal
anecdotes
in
long
dull
chapters
of
history
they
seemed
to
look
at
me
and
sympathize
cocking
their
heads
on
one
side
as
if
to
say
poor
foolish
modern
man
why
do
you
make
a
virtue
of
necessity
and
get
rid
of
this
still
more
foolish
modern
maid
by
promising
her
anything
she
asks
then
you
can
go
listen
to
that
princely
looking
person
in
the
green
turban
who
might
be
descended
from
the
kings
our
ancestors
used
to
behold
he
does
seem
to
know
something
about
the
history
of
this
place
on
which
are
authorities
the
dragomans
who
bring
crowds
of
tourists
to
our
temple
and
gabble
nonsense
put
us
really
off
our
feed
peep
peep
just
hear
him
tell
about
the
staircase
we
so
proud
of
did
know
there
was
a
picture
of
it
in
the
book
of
the
dead
with
osiris
standing
at
the
top
like
a
good
host
waiting
to
receive
his
guests
well
then
if
you
did
do
anything
you
must
to
escape
from
that
lovesick
girl
while
there
time
to
hear
a
real
scholar
talk
of
who
is
at
the
head
of
the
staircase
peep
peep
hurry
up
or
you
lose
it
all
you
silly
of
course
the
real
staircase
is
in
amenti
which
your
roman
catholics
call
purgatory
and
no
doubt
osiris
is
standing
on
it
to
this
day
so
i
took
the
birds
advice
and
promised
enid
to
have
a
heart
to
heart
talk
with
harry
snell
satisfied
that
she
had
got
all
that
was
to
be
got
out
of
me
she
powdered
her
nose
in
the
same
spirit
that
david
anointed
his
head
and
attached
herself
to
rachel
in
whose
train
was
the
desired
one
thus
basely
did
i
free
myself
to
enjoy
the
society
of
biddy
and
osiris
with
lovely
carved
glimpses
of
isis
thrown
in
to
say
nothing
of
seti
i
and
rameses
ii
trying
to
push
into
the
background
of
my
mind
the
nauseating
thought
of
my
vow
and
its
fulfillment
i
helped
brigit
and
monny
take
snapshots
of
king
seti
showing
his
son
rameses
how
to
lasso
and
also
to
catch
by
its
tail
the
most
fascinating
of
bulls
they
were
on
the
wall
of
course
rameses
and
seti
i
mean
not
brigit
and
monny
but
seemed
so
real
they
might
leap
off
at
any
instant
and
so
charmed
was
monny
with
rameses
braided
lock
of
youth
that
she
resolved
to
try
one
over
her
left
temple
in
connection
with
an
egyptian
princess
costume
she
was
having
made
for
some
future
ball
i
ca
take
a
grain
of
interest
in
any
one
but
egyptian
princes
and
princesses
and
their
profiles
she
exclaimed
then
blushed
faintly
and
added
i
mean
princes
and
princesses
of
the
we
got
some
good
pictures
of
the
temple
of
seti
for
monny
had
an
apparatus
for
natural
colour
photography
which
gave
sensational
results
in
ancient
when
any
one
except
monny
herself
did
the
taking
it
was
better
still
in
the
seven
chapels
the
holy
of
holies
at
abydos
and
in
the
joy
of
my
first
colour
photography
i
forgot
the
doom
ahead
appropriately
the
sword
i
had
hung
up
over
my
own
cranium
descended
in
the
necropolis
at
that
place
of
tombs
called
umm
mother
of
pots
nobody
wanted
to
see
the
fragments
of
this
mother
pots
but
i
insisted
on
a
brief
visit
as
important
discoveries
have
been
made
there
among
the
most
important
in
egypt
it
was
a
dreary
place
where
harry
snell
strolled
up
and
caught
me
alone
gazing
at
a
desolation
of
sandy
hillocks
full
of
undiscovered
treasure
look
here
said
he
you
supposed
to
know
everything
tell
me
why
they
call
seats
outside
shops
in
bazaars
and
tombs
of
the
ancient
empire
by
the
same
name
mastaba
i
explained
that
mastaba
was
an
arab
word
meaning
bench
then
realizing
that
it
would
be
flying
in
the
face
of
providence
not
to
get
the
ordeal
over
while
my
blood
was
up
i
spoke
of
enid
among
the
shattered
pots
and
yawning
sepulchres
i
racked
up
her
broken
heart
and
blighted
affections
i
talked
to
snell
like
a
brother
and
when
he
had
heard
me
through
in
silence
to
the
place
where
words
and
breath
failed
i
thought
that
i
had
moved
him
his
eyes
were
downcast
i
fancied
that
i
saw
a
mist
as
of
tears
a
man
slow
tears
then
suddenly
he
opened
his
eyelids
wide
and
glared
a
glare
stony
as
the
pots
and
as
the
desert
hills
borrow
he
said
i
thought
you
were
a
good
fellow
and
a
man
of
the
world
i
see
now
that
you
a
damned
sentimental
ass
with
this
he
stalked
off
and
i
could
not
run
after
him
to
bash
his
head
because
what
he
said
was
perfectly
true
i
was
almost
sorry
that
evening
on
board
the
boat
when
he
apologized
and
the
went
on
as
if
i
had
broken
it
by
being
the
sort
of
fool
snell
had
said
that
i
was
in
the
dream
were
nile
cities
with
crowding
houses
whose
walls
were
heightened
by
tier
upon
tier
of
pots
moulded
in
with
mud
there
were
stretches
of
sandy
shore
and
green
gloom
of
palm
groves
there
were
domed
tombs
of
saints
glittering
like
in
the
sun
there
were
great
golden
mounds
inlaid
with
strips
of
paler
gold
picked
out
with
ebony
there
were
sinister
hillsides
cut
into
squarely
by
leading
to
there
were
always
shadoofs
where
giant
everlastingly
dipped
water
and
threw
it
out
again
mounting
up
from
level
to
level
of
the
brown
shore
the
wistful
musical
wail
of
the
men
at
the
wells
was
as
near
to
the
voice
of
nature
as
the
sighing
of
wind
or
the
breaking
of
waves
which
has
never
ceased
since
the
world
began
sometimes
the
horizon
was
opal
sometimes
it
throbbed
with
azure
fire
or
blazed
ruby
red
as
the
torch
of
sunset
swept
west
and
east
before
the
emerald
darkness
fell
when
our
landed
great
flocks
of
kites
like
in
form
and
wing
to
the
sacred
vulture
of
egypt
flew
to
welcome
us
with
swoopings
of
wide
purple
wings
their
shadows
on
the
water
were
like
passing
spirits
and
at
night
when
the
nubian
boatmen
danced
their
feet
thudding
on
the
lower
deck
to
the
cry
of
the
darabukah
the
nile
whispered
of
the
past
with
a
tinkling
whisper
like
the
music
of
hathor
sacred
sistrum
gyassas
glided
by
loaded
with
pots
like
magic
melons
long
masts
pointing
as
though
they
had
been
wands
in
the
hands
of
astrologers
and
the
reflection
of
the
piled
pots
as
they
moved
gave
vague
glimpses
as
of
sunken
treasure
denderah
meant
work
for
fenton
there
had
been
trouble
there
and
tourists
had
complained
of
insults
it
was
the
hadji
business
to
find
out
whether
natives
or
europeans
had
been
more
to
blame
and
whether
there
were
wrongs
to
right
misunderstandings
to
adjust
but
to
the
rest
of
us
denderah
meant
the
sacred
temple
of
hathor
goddess
of
love
in
some
ways
one
of
the
most
beautiful
of
all
the
nile
temples
though
being
not
much
over
two
thousand
years
old
it
was
built
upon
ruins
more
ancient
than
king
menes
archeologists
like
neill
sheridan
class
it
as
late
ptolemaic
uninterestingly
modern
east
had
been
looking
forward
to
the
temple
of
denderah
more
eagerly
than
to
any
other
because
she
had
read
that
on
an
outer
wall
was
carved
the
portrait
of
cleopatra
the
great
that
of
cæsarion
was
there
also
as
she
must
have
known
but
cleopatra
son
was
never
referred
to
by
her
reincarnation
who
chose
to
ignore
the
cæsar
incident
east
had
not
yet
deigned
to
mount
a
donkey
but
to
reach
the
temple
she
must
do
so
or
walk
or
sway
in
a
dangerous
looking
à
rather
than
miss
the
joy
of
seeing
herself
on
a
stone
wall
as
others
had
had
the
privilege
of
seeing
her
for
two
thousand
years
she
consented
to
accept
as
a
seat
a
large
gray
animal
tasselled
with
red
to
keep
off
flies
and
evil
eyes
wo
you
ride
with
me
antoun
effendi
she
asked
i
afraid
this
creature
looks
as
large
as
an
elephant
and
as
wild
as
a
zebra
i
feel
could
calm
him
but
antoun
effendi
was
not
going
to
ride
he
had
other
fish
to
fry
and
poor
cleopatra
luminous
dark
eyes
were
like
overflowing
lakes
when
he
had
politely
excused
himself
on
the
plea
of
a
pressing
engagement
i
felt
sure
that
she
would
have
been
kind
to
sir
marcus
if
at
that
moment
he
could
have
appeared
from
behind
the
picturesque
group
of
sellers
or
emerged
from
one
of
the
huge
baskets
exposed
for
sale
on
a
hill
of
sand
i
do
know
whether
it
made
things
better
or
worse
that
the
gray
donkey
should
be
named
cleopatra
but
it
was
evidently
a
blow
when
the
animal
attendant
announced
himself
as
anthony
i
ca
and
wo
have
the
creature
with
me
she
murmured
as
i
helped
her
to
mount
when
she
had
pushed
the
boy
aside
thank
you
lord
ernest
you
very
kind
but
antoun
ought
to
have
been
here
fancy
seeing
temple
of
all
others
without
an
anthony
of
any
sort
on
the
horizon
a
pity
it
is
middle
name
if
you
could
spare
time
to
ride
with
me
that
would
be
better
than
nothing
i
be
delighted
i
said
hypocritically
for
i
had
been
dying
to
talk
with
brigit
about
the
monny
and
rachel
imbroglio
which
as
a
conductor
i
had
not
since
abydos
found
a
chance
to
discuss
besides
biddy
had
whispered
in
passing
that
a
letter
just
delivered
at
denderah
had
brought
exciting
news
of
esmé
but
i
was
sorry
for
cleopatra
and
wondered
whether
i
could
manage
after
all
to
hint
an
explanation
of
the
hieroglyphic
that
fatal
letter
of
mine
which
had
stealthily
made
mischief
between
east
and
anthony
i
did
quite
see
how
the
subject
was
to
be
broached
still
some
way
might
open
i
sorry
about
the
middle
name
i
said
but
if
i
assumed
it
like
a
virtue
which
i
have
not
i
should
be
the
third
person
connected
with
this
trip
labelled
the
same
fashion
who
is
the
second
person
she
asked
abruptly
as
all
the
animals
of
the
party
started
to
trot
vivaciously
through
the
blowing
yellow
sand
sir
marcus
surely
you
heard
that
his
stands
for
antonius
good
heavens
she
gasped
and
i
hardly
knew
whether
it
was
the
shock
of
my
news
or
a
jolt
of
the
donkey
which
forced
the
exclamation
whatever
it
was
the
emotion
she
felt
bound
her
to
silence
after
that
one
outburst
she
said
not
a
word
and
did
not
even
groan
or
threaten
to
fall
off
when
both
our
beasts
broke
into
a
thumping
gallop
in
silence
we
swept
round
that
great
bulk
of
rubbish
heap
roman
and
early
christian
under
which
lies
an
the
town
of
the
column
cleopatra
did
not
cry
out
when
suddenly
we
came
in
sight
of
hathor
temple
against
the
turquoise
sky
and
vast
as
some
wagnerian
palace
of
the
gods
the
tasselled
donkey
or
i
had
given
her
cause
to
think
or
perhaps
she
did
not
consider
me
worth
talking
to
as
we
approached
the
temple
toward
which
all
her
previous
travelling
had
been
a
mere
pilgrimage
still
silently
when
we
had
left
our
donkeys
and
were
following
the
crowd
up
the
dromos
harry
snell
actually
with
enid
thanks
to
me
and
the
wisdom
of
second
thoughts
cleopatra
eyes
wandered
over
the
columns
with
their
clinging
colour
and
over
the
portal
with
its
brilliant
mass
of
yellow
of
dark
pompeian
red
and
the
sacred
to
hathor
whom
horus
loved
whose
priestesses
danced
within
these
walls
in
day
oh
this
red
and
this
were
my
colours
i
remember
she
murmured
and
then
hardly
spoke
when
i
walked
with
her
in
the
gloom
of
the
temple
itself
the
rich
gloom
under
heavily
ornamented
ceilings
she
wanted
to
save
the
portrait
till
the
last
she
announced
until
after
she
had
seen
everything
else
and
she
did
care
sheridan
said
about
her
temple
it
was
wonderful
i
tried
to
interest
her
in
the
crocodiles
which
had
been
detested
and
persecuted
at
denderah
in
the
late
cleopatra
time
as
ardently
as
they
were
worshipped
at
crocodilopolis
and
other
places
i
joked
about
old
egypt
having
consisted
of
crocs
and
non
crocs
just
as
the
inhabitants
of
florence
had
to
be
guelphs
or
ghibellines
i
explained
carefully
the
geography
of
the
place
or
rather
reminded
cleopatra
of
it
adding
details
of
the
canal
which
once
led
to
koptos
where
the
magic
book
of
the
wisdom
of
thoth
lay
hidden
under
the
nile
i
could
not
waken
east
from
reverie
to
interest
as
antoun
would
have
had
the
power
to
do
but
my
vanity
was
not
hurt
it
was
only
my
curiosity
which
suffered
for
i
wanted
desperately
to
know
whether
the
donkey
had
seriously
jolted
the
lady
spine
or
whether
the
news
that
sir
lark
was
marcus
antonius
not
a
more
obvious
marcus
aurelius
had
fired
her
imagination
in
any
case
i
devoted
myself
to
her
while
monny
and
brigit
frolicked
with
others
and
i
had
a
reward
of
a
kind
when
we
had
seen
all
the
halls
and
chambers
and
the
crypt
with
its
carvings
all
fresh
as
if
made
yesterday
when
we
had
been
on
the
roof
where
chanting
priests
had
once
awaited
the
rising
of
sirius
when
i
had
taken
her
outside
the
temple
where
blowing
columns
of
dusty
sand
rose
like
incense
from
hidden
altars
of
hathor
we
stood
at
last
alone
together
gazing
up
at
the
figures
of
cleopatra
and
her
son
the
wall
on
which
they
were
carved
rose
behind
the
holy
of
holies
where
the
golden
statue
of
the
goddess
had
been
kept
but
alas
the
figures
themselves
alas
i
knew
how
cleopatra
must
be
feeling
and
i
dared
not
speak
perhaps
she
was
even
blushing
but
i
did
not
look
instead
i
gazed
helplessly
up
at
that
exposed
misshapen
form
that
flaccid
chin
thank
heaven
it
only
who
are
with
me
breathed
east
that
was
my
reward
or
should
i
call
it
a
punishment
anyhow
it
made
it
easier
for
the
insignificant
person
in
question
to
unburden
his
conscience
about
the
hieroglyphic
letter
i
stammered
it
all
out
on
the
way
back
apropos
of
the
which
had
been
tentyra
i
let
it
remind
me
of
fustât
and
our
digging
expedition
i
had
meant
to
follow
east
advice
and
propose
to
miss
gilder
i
explained
but
monny
had
not
found
my
buried
what
had
become
of
it
i
er
had
never
been
told
all
i
knew
was
that
it
had
come
into
miss
gilder
hands
and
i
should
never
have
as
much
courage
again
oh
cleopatra
exclaimed
with
a
curious
light
in
her
eyes
more
like
relief
than
disappointment
you
really
do
want
to
marry
my
niece
you
delayed
so
that
i
wondered
i
was
sure
sometimes
if
it
were
monny
or
but
i
am
on
your
side
lord
ernest
it
is
too
late
yet
any
of
perhaps
trust
in
me
i
going
to
help
you
i
could
have
bitten
my
tongue
out
though
i
had
blundered
with
the
best
intentions
east
i
protested
almost
ferociously
you
do
anything
i
said
before
i
began
that
i
was
going
to
tell
you
a
i
wo
betray
your
confidence
but
i
help
i
want
to
it
would
be
a
good
thing
for
monny
to
accept
you
lord
ernest
a
very
good
thing
in
more
ways
than
one
jones
wants
it
too
or
did
i
promise
you
i
be
discreet
with
that
we
arrived
in
sight
of
the
boat
once
more
necklaces
and
scarabs
and
baskets
were
thrust
under
our
noses
anthony
had
returned
from
his
mysterious
whisperings
in
cafés
or
mosques
in
the
new
town
and
was
waiting
for
us
cleopatra
called
him
with
a
note
of
gayety
in
her
voice
to
help
her
off
the
elephant
he
came
i
felt
she
was
going
to
hint
to
him
that
i
was
in
love
with
monny
hint
to
brigit
also
virtue
may
be
its
own
reward
but
it
makes
you
very
lonely
i
had
another
easy
moment
for
dreaming
the
and
we
all
woke
out
of
it
when
with
the
pink
dawn
of
a
certain
morning
we
saw
a
vast
temple
repeated
column
for
column
in
the
clear
river
as
in
a
mirror
of
glass
we
were
at
luxor
and
somewhere
not
far
off
mabella
hânem
was
praying
for
release
chapter
xx
the
zone
of
fire
just
at
the
first
moment
of
waking
when
i
was
moved
by
my
subconscious
self
to
roll
out
of
my
berth
and
bound
to
the
cabin
window
i
forgot
that
we
had
anything
more
active
to
do
at
luxor
than
worship
the
glory
of
sky
and
river
and
temples
i
had
room
in
my
mind
only
for
the
of
that
astounding
picture
into
the
foreground
of
which
i
seemed
to
have
been
thrust
so
close
upon
my
eyes
loomed
the
line
of
lotus
columns
it
was
as
if
the
ancient
gods
had
poured
a
libation
of
ruby
wine
from
their
into
the
translucent
depths
of
the
nile
even
the
long
colonnade
of
broken
pillars
was
deep
against
a
pale
rose
sky
repeated
again
in
deeper
rose
down
in
a
magic
world
beneath
the
pink
crystal
roof
of
shining
water
then
suddenly
bright
windows
of
sky
behind
the
dark
flamed
to
the
colour
of
primroses
were
shot
with
pansy
purple
and
cleared
to
the
transparent
green
of
unflawed
emerald
the
thought
came
as
i
gazed
at
the
carved
wonder
reflected
flower
for
flower
and
line
for
line
in
the
still
river
that
here
was
illustrated
in
unearthly
beauty
the
chief
religious
legend
of
ancient
egypt
as
each
human
soul
was
believed
to
be
a
part
of
the
osiris
reunited
with
him
beyond
the
western
desert
after
death
so
did
these
columns
made
by
human
hands
unite
themselves
at
sunrise
with
the
soul
of
the
nile
the
life
of
egypt
i
caught
a
glimpse
as
if
in
an
illuminated
parable
of
the
egyptian
cosmos
the
heavens
the
earth
the
depths
three
separate
entities
yet
forever
one
as
is
the
christian
trinity
almost
i
expected
to
see
the
of
the
gods
steered
slowly
across
the
river
from
the
city
of
kings
westward
to
the
tombs
of
kings
and
the
little
birds
which
promenaded
the
deck
of
our
boat
as
though
it
belonged
to
them
might
have
been
from
the
world
of
mummies
across
the
nile
escaped
for
a
glimpse
of
rameses
gayly
painted
mosaiced
white
palace
with
its
carved
brass
balconies
its
climbing
roses
its
lake
of
lotuses
and
its
river
gardens
i
was
sure
that
if
i
told
these
tiny
creatures
that
the
pharaohs
and
all
their
glories
had
vanished
off
the
earth
except
for
a
few
bits
in
museums
they
would
not
believe
the
tale
i
was
even
sure
i
believed
it
myself
and
deliberately
blotting
out
of
sight
the
big
modern
hotels
and
the
low
white
line
of
shops
away
to
the
right
of
the
temple
i
tried
to
see
with
the
eastern
thebes
as
it
must
have
been
in
the
days
of
rameses
ii
i
pictured
the
temple
before
cambyses
the
persian
and
the
great
earthquake
felled
arches
and
pillars
obelisks
and
kingly
statues
i
built
up
again
the
houses
of
the
priests
and
nobles
glistening
white
and
fantastically
painted
in
many
colours
i
laid
out
lawns
and
flower
beds
and
set
fountains
playing
then
with
a
rumbling
shock
a
chasm
many
thousand
years
deep
yawned
between
me
and
ancient
no
the
city
of
palaces
it
was
the
voice
of
sir
john
biddell
which
opened
the
ravine
of
time
and
let
the
nile
pour
through
it
he
was
on
deck
in
pyjamas
and
overcoat
with
general
harlow
holding
forth
on
his
favourite
topic
of
mummies
an
appropriate
subject
for
this
neighbourhood
of
all
others
yet
i
should
have
preferred
silence
poor
sir
john
he
had
been
disappointed
in
cairo
because
a
villain
had
not
lurked
behind
each
of
the
trees
in
the
esbekîya
gardens
and
notes
tied
with
silken
black
hairs
had
not
tumbled
on
his
respectable
bald
head
from
the
mystery
of
latticed
windows
but
he
was
thoroughly
enjoying
his
nile
trip
and
learning
something
every
day
to
tell
at
home
lady
biddell
had
humiliated
him
twice
once
by
asking
me
if
those
old
hieroglyphics
were
written
in
arabic
again
by
inquiring
whether
the
temple
windows
had
been
filled
in
once
with
pretty
stained
glass
but
he
had
forgiven
her
because
yesterday
had
been
their
day
and
he
meant
to
buy
her
a
present
at
some
at
luxor
a
pity
it
is
the
wooden
wedding
i
heard
him
say
to
general
harlow
for
i
might
give
a
handsome
i
suppose
silver
will
have
to
be
persian
or
indian
unless
i
can
get
hold
of
one
of
those
old
bracelets
or
discs
the
egyptians
used
for
money
but
that
too
good
to
hope
for
it
certainly
was
though
no
doubt
some
industrious
manufacturer
of
antiques
would
cheerfully
have
made
and
dug
up
any
amount
on
the
site
of
rameses
palace
could
he
have
known
in
time
we
were
to
have
three
days
at
luxor
three
days
when
three
months
would
have
been
too
little
and
the
second
attempt
at
abducting
an
lady
from
the
harem
of
her
treacherous
lord
would
take
place
as
soon
as
we
could
learn
that
our
auxiliaries
the
bronsons
had
arrived
until
they
were
on
the
spot
even
a
success
might
prove
an
meanwhile
i
had
plenty
to
do
in
playing
my
more
obvious
part
of
conductor
and
arranging
the
last
details
of
our
excursion
programme
every
one
had
bundled
out
early
to
see
the
sunrise
consequently
most
members
of
the
set
were
cross
or
hungry
or
both
nothing
could
be
less
suitable
than
to
clamour
for
porridge
on
the
nile
but
they
did
it
and
called
for
bacon
too
in
a
land
where
the
pig
is
an
unclean
animal
they
were
the
same
people
who
played
coon
can
and
bridge
on
the
deck
at
twilight
when
moving
figures
on
shore
were
etched
in
black
on
silver
or
against
flaming
wings
of
sunset
and
in
gathering
darkness
the
who
bent
and
rose
against
dykes
were
like
persian
enamels
done
on
copper
hundred
gated
thebes
the
dwelling
of
whom
greece
adopted
as
used
to
lie
on
both
banks
of
the
nile
the
east
for
the
living
the
west
for
the
dead
and
those
who
lived
by
catering
for
mummyhood
i
had
arranged
to
take
our
people
first
round
luxor
making
them
acquainted
with
the
temple
which
had
already
introduced
its
reflection
to
us
as
for
the
town
they
were
capable
of
making
themselves
acquainted
with
that
its
hotels
and
when
there
was
nothing
more
important
on
hand
next
was
to
come
karnak
the
father
of
temples
once
connected
with
the
younger
temple
at
luxor
as
if
by
a
long
jewelled
necklace
of
sphinxes
and
for
those
whose
brains
and
legs
were
intact
by
evening
i
thought
of
a
visit
to
the
thrilling
temple
of
mût
this
last
would
be
an
adventure
for
mût
goddess
of
matter
the
mother
goddess
has
apparently
not
taken
kindly
to
moslem
rule
any
disagreeable
trick
she
and
her
attendant
black
statues
of
passion
fierce
sekhet
can
play
on
a
devout
mohammedan
are
meat
and
drink
to
her
but
she
can
work
her
spells
only
after
dusk
therefore
none
save
the
bravest
arab
will
venture
his
head
inside
her
domain
past
sunset
i
was
sure
we
could
get
no
dragoman
to
go
with
us
and
equally
sure
that
the
adventure
would
be
more
popular
for
its
spice
of
horror
the
second
and
third
days
i
allotted
to
western
thebes
the
city
of
the
dead
the
tombs
of
the
kings
the
tombs
of
the
queens
and
the
nobles
then
the
ramesseum
the
musical
memnon
with
his
companion
colossus
and
the
great
temples
wrapped
in
the
ruddy
fire
of
the
western
desert
where
hathor
receives
the
setting
sun
in
outstretched
arms
as
i
was
about
to
unfold
these
projects
at
breakfast
a
telegram
was
handed
to
me
i
read
it
and
while
bacon
plates
were
being
exchanged
for
dishes
of
marmalade
i
cudgelled
my
brain
like
a
slave
to
make
it
rearrange
the
whole
programme
without
a
hitch
the
american
consul
wired
from
asiut
that
he
was
detained
by
an
important
personage
who
wanted
to
know
things
about
egyptian
cotton
and
its
enemy
the
boll
worm
but
and
bronson
would
arrive
at
the
villa
sirius
luxor
day
after
ready
for
emergencies
of
course
being
conductor
of
a
tour
and
next
a
man
i
ought
to
have
put
the
interests
of
sir
marcus
and
his
lark
pie
as
we
were
called
by
rival
firms
ahead
of
personal
concerns
i
ought
to
have
immolated
myself
in
the
western
mummyland
with
the
consciousness
of
duty
done
while
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
nile
anthony
fenton
and
monny
gilder
and
biddy
played
the
live
modern
game
of
kidnapping
a
lady
but
i
determined
to
do
nothing
of
the
sort
i
gazed
at
the
telegram
with
the
air
of
committing
to
heart
instructions
from
my
superior
officer
and
without
sign
of
inward
tremour
announced
that
we
would
explore
the
wonders
of
the
west
before
visiting
those
nearer
at
hand
the
weather
being
cool
and
the
wind
not
too
high
i
said
it
would
be
well
to
seize
this
opportunity
for
the
valley
of
the
tombs
of
the
kings
an
expedition
trying
in
heat
or
sand
storms
also
would
be
devoted
to
the
west
and
our
third
day
would
belong
to
luxor
and
karnak
as
a
i
dangled
the
adventure
of
the
temple
of
mût
to
sweeten
the
temper
of
grumblers
but
there
were
no
grumblers
the
set
listened
calmly
to
my
honeyed
plausibilities
and
the
alarmed
stewards
dared
not
betray
their
consternation
at
the
lightning
change
no
doubt
they
thought
me
mad
or
worse
because
a
day
in
western
thebes
meant
a
picnic
magical
apparition
at
the
right
moment
in
a
convenient
tomb
of
smiling
arabs
and
nubian
men
with
baskets
of
food
and
iced
drinks
somehow
the
trick
had
to
be
managed
however
for
i
must
be
in
eastern
thebes
alias
luxor
on
the
day
when
the
bronsons
presence
would
render
our
second
attempt
at
rescue
feasible
i
had
to
interview
the
chêf
a
formidable
person
hypnotizing
him
and
the
stewards
to
work
my
will
and
above
all
i
had
to
make
sure
of
boats
and
donkeys
for
the
party
at
short
notice
only
by
a
miracle
could
all
go
well
but
i
set
my
heart
upon
that
miracle
antoun
hurriedly
taken
into
my
confidence
volunteered
to
arrange
about
the
boats
and
the
donkeys
for
the
other
side
fortunately
there
was
no
rival
ahead
of
us
and
with
juggling
of
plans
and
jingle
of
silver
anthony
part
was
done
just
at
the
moment
when
by
dint
of
bribes
and
adjurations
i
had
induced
chêf
and
stewards
to
smile
fenton
dashed
on
board
to
cry
victory
somehow
less
than
an
hour
later
than
we
should
have
started
we
got
off
in
two
big
boats
with
white
sails
and
brown
rowers
the
canvas
did
its
work
in
silent
bulging
dignity
but
the
rowers
exhausted
themselves
by
breathlessly
imploring
allah
to
grant
them
strength
and
shouting
extra
prayers
to
some
whose
name
was
calculated
to
pump
dry
the
strongest
lungs
on
the
mystic
western
side
where
once
landed
with
pomp
and
pageant
the
of
the
gods
and
the
mourning
boats
of
the
dead
we
scrambled
on
shore
with
that
ribald
mirth
which
always
made
the
set
feel
it
was
getting
its
money
worth
of
enjoyment
many
donkeys
and
a
few
carriages
awaited
us
the
whole
equipment
previously
engaged
for
and
in
opaline
sunshine
which
stained
with
pale
rose
the
theban
hills
and
piled
the
shadows
full
of
dark
dulled
rubies
we
started
across
an
emerald
plain
kept
ever
verdant
by
nile
water
the
touch
of
comedy
in
the
dream
of
beauty
was
the
queer
village
of
kurna
with
its
tomb
dwellings
of
the
poor
and
immense
mud
vases
shaped
like
mushrooms
standing
straight
up
on
thick
brown
stems
before
the
crowded
hovels
in
each
vase
reposed
sleeping
babies
brooding
hens
dogs
rabbits
or
any
other
live
stock
mixed
with
such
rubbish
as
the
family
possessed
and
the
most
ambitious
mushrooms
were
decorated
with
barbaric
crenellations
almost
as
far
as
the
temple
of
seti
i
flowed
the
green
wave
like
a
lake
in
the
desert
but
beyond
to
join
the
sahara
rolled
and
billowed
a
waste
of
sand
shot
with
topaz
light
and
walled
with
fantastic
rocks
yellow
and
crimson
streaked
with
purple
in
the
heart
of
each
shadow
fire
burned
like
dying
coals
in
a
mass
of
rosy
ashes
and
the
light
over
all
was
luminous
as
light
on
southern
seas
at
moonrise
and
sunset
before
our
eyes
seemed
to
float
a
diaphanous
veil
of
gilded
gauze
and
white
robes
and
red
sashes
of
animals
bead
necklaces
and
blue
or
green
scarfs
on
girls
hats
were
like
magical
flowers
blowing
over
the
gold
of
the
desert
everything
blew
above
all
sand
blew
we
found
that
out
to
our
sorrow
after
we
had
seen
the
temple
of
kurna
with
its
noble
columns
and
its
fine
fragment
of
roof
where
squares
of
sky
were
let
in
like
blocks
of
lapis
lazuli
i
rushed
here
and
there
on
assuring
people
that
this
was
not
we
felt
it
was
only
a
breeze
we
could
not
have
a
more
favourable
day
for
our
excursion
into
this
world
of
the
dead
why
if
we
waited
till
we
might
have
met
a
wind
perhaps
even
khamsin
alias
simoom
the
terror
of
the
desert
to
make
miss
and
cleopatra
forget
the
smarting
of
their
eyes
i
told
them
what
a
was
like
and
how
its
names
in
arabic
turkish
and
persian
all
came
from
the
fiend
samiel
who
destroyed
caravans
just
as
devil
came
from
the
persian
div
little
breeze
was
from
the
east
which
at
thebes
in
old
days
was
considered
lucky
the
west
wind
used
to
bear
across
the
river
evil
spirits
disguised
as
and
these
wicked
ones
had
not
far
to
travel
because
the
tuat
or
underworld
was
a
long
narrow
valley
parallel
to
egypt
beginning
on
the
west
bank
of
the
nile
set
was
ruler
there
the
god
who
had
to
be
propitiated
by
having
kings
named
after
him
but
rä
greater
than
he
could
safely
pass
down
the
dim
river
running
through
that
world
could
pass
in
his
golden
guided
by
magic
words
of
thoth
instead
of
oars
or
sails
and
the
guardian
hippopotamus
whom
greeks
turned
into
the
dog
cerberus
dared
not
put
out
a
paw
east
remembered
that
thebes
was
tape
in
her
day
at
which
miss
snorted
and
when
out
came
that
familiar
story
about
cleopatra
making
red
hair
fashionable
miss
stared
coldly
at
the
lady
auburn
waves
i
wonder
if
the
queen
got
the
colour
at
her
hairdresser
as
people
do
now
she
murmured
i
read
that
they
had
in
those
days
and
used
arsenic
for
their
complexion
and
all
sorts
of
mixtures
besides
i
ca
imagine
anything
natural
about
cleopatra
except
the
asp
wanting
to
bite
her
upon
this
east
retaliated
by
calling
her
companion
miss
bean
without
the
hassett
i
shall
always
think
of
the
valley
of
the
tombs
as
a
place
of
terror
and
splendour
meant
to
be
hidden
from
mortals
by
the
spells
of
thoth
who
circled
the
of
the
dead
with
a
zone
of
fire
as
wotan
hid
brunhilda
and
decreed
that
they
should
be
lost
forever
in
the
blazing
desert
despite
thoth
and
his
magic
men
have
burst
through
the
blazing
belt
and
found
in
the
heart
of
the
rocks
sacred
shrines
the
wise
old
god
would
have
protected
they
have
found
many
but
not
all
for
in
the
breast
of
some
one
among
thoth
sleeping
lions
which
masquerade
as
rocks
may
yet
be
discovered
a
tomb
better
than
all
those
we
know
with
their
buried
store
of
jewels
and
their
painted
walls
like
drapings
of
strange
tapestry
we
broke
through
the
zone
of
fire
and
it
pursued
us
with
burning
smoke
of
sand
pink
as
powdered
rubies
always
it
was
beautiful
and
terrible
as
we
rode
in
the
blowing
pink
mist
and
still
it
was
beautiful
and
terrible
when
half
dazed
we
slipped
off
donkeys
or
slid
out
of
carriages
to
enter
the
tombs
which
the
desert
had
vainly
striven
to
hide
it
was
hot
and
breathless
in
those
underground
chambers
scooped
out
of
solid
rock
thousands
of
years
ago
that
great
kings
and
their
queens
and
families
and
friends
might
rest
with
their
kas
in
eternal
privacy
enid
biddell
waited
until
harry
snell
happened
to
be
exactly
behind
her
and
then
fainted
with
dexterity
beyond
praise
cleopatra
however
was
in
her
element
she
felt
at
home
and
did
not
turn
one
of
those
auburn
hairs
scorned
by
miss
bean
at
sight
of
the
royal
mummies
lit
up
by
electricity
in
their
coffins
these
gave
the
rest
of
us
a
shock
our
nerves
being
already
in
the
condition
of
aladdin
on
his
way
down
to
the
cave
of
jewels
when
the
guardian
of
the
tomb
of
amenhetep
the
king
had
several
other
names
which
annoyed
sir
john
biddell
darkened
the
painted
royal
chamber
of
death
and
suddenly
lit
up
several
white
sleeping
faces
the
ghostly
dusk
was
alive
with
little
gasps
there
lay
amenhetep
himself
in
a
disproportionately
large
sarcophagus
of
granite
from
suan
and
in
companion
coffins
were
a
woman
and
a
girl
all
three
brilliantly
illuminated
they
had
the
look
of
the
light
hurting
their
poor
eyes
and
being
outraged
because
against
their
will
they
were
treated
as
if
they
had
been
paintings
by
old
masters
the
dreadful
rumour
ran
that
the
woman
was
none
other
than
the
great
queen
hatasu
never
mind
her
more
scientific
names
her
mummy
never
having
been
found
or
at
any
rate
identified
and
it
was
pitiful
seeing
her
so
small
and
female
when
in
life
she
had
wished
to
be
represented
with
a
beard
and
the
clothing
of
a
man
our
dragoman
who
read
english
newspapers
and
whose
idea
of
entertaining
his
crowd
was
to
make
cheap
jokes
just
as
his
family
doubtless
manufactured
cheap
scarabs
announced
that
hatasu
was
the
first
suffragette
but
even
those
who
thought
her
downtrodden
nephew
thothmes
iii
justified
in
erasing
every
trace
of
her
existence
wherever
possible
did
not
smile
at
this
jest
in
fact
having
antoun
and
me
to
refer
to
the
set
as
a
whole
sat
upon
the
unfortunate
dragoman
trying
to
talk
him
down
in
tombs
and
temples
or
ostentatiously
reading
weigall
maspero
petrie
sladen
and
lorimer
when
he
attempted
to
give
them
information
a
few
with
kinder
intentions
however
interrupted
his
flow
of
historical
narrative
by
exclaiming
why
yes
of
i
thought
so
and
now
i
remember
he
revenged
himself
by
advising
everybody
to
buy
antiques
from
an
extraordinary
old
gentleman
extremely
like
a
galvanized
mummy
the
antiques
were
extraordinary
too
so
everybody
took
the
dragoman
advice
neglecting
the
other
curiosity
merchants
of
the
squatting
row
near
the
and
the
glorious
temple
in
that
vast
copper
cup
of
desert
and
cliff
which
is
called
der
the
sale
in
mummied
hawks
gilded
rams
horns
broken
tiles
with
beetles
flying
out
of
the
sun
boats
of
the
gods
and
gods
themselves
was
brisk
round
this
ancient
gentleman
who
advertised
a
blue
by
wearing
it
on
his
bald
pate
and
seemed
to
possess
as
many
royal
scarabs
as
a
dressmaker
has
pins
afterward
i
learned
that
he
was
our
dragoman
father
but
i
was
loyal
and
did
not
tell
it
was
a
wonderful
day
all
the
more
wonderful
perhaps
because
it
left
in
the
mind
a
colourful
confusion
pictures
of
painted
tombs
hidden
deep
under
red
rock
and
drifted
sand
tombs
which
we
should
perhaps
never
reach
again
through
their
guarding
zone
of
fire
tombs
of
kings
and
queens
and
nobles
forgotten
through
thousands
of
centuries
save
by
their
kas
and
has
their
friends
and
servants
painted
or
sculptured
on
the
walls
with
the
sole
purpose
of
caring
for
or
entertaining
them
eternally
already
we
had
ceased
to
remember
which
was
which
and
back
on
the
boat
in
the
hour
of
sunset
when
dazzling
tinsel
and
pale
pink
sailed
over
a
lake
of
clear
green
sky
the
set
argued
whether
the
king
with
the
horses
or
the
queen
with
the
retroussé
nose
was
in
this
or
that
tomb
sir
john
biddell
recalled
the
fact
that
egyptian
horses
had
been
celebrated
and
that
it
was
as
swell
a
thing
to
be
a
charioteer
then
as
it
was
now
to
be
a
vanderbilt
with
a
coach
and
four
as
for
a
retroussé
nose
it
did
matter
it
was
on
a
or
on
a
girl
face
monny
thought
differently
she
and
biddy
were
glad
that
the
sand
and
rocks
would
still
hide
many
secret
treasures
while
the
world
lasted
it
would
be
dreadful
to
think
that
everything
was
dug
up
for
tourists
to
pry
into
or
to
cart
away
to
museums
and
no
mysteries
left
as
for
east
she
was
doubtful
whether
to
rejoice
or
grieve
that
cleopatra
mummy
had
not
been
found
if
however
it
were
like
the
incised
wall
portrait
at
denderah
it
would
be
well
that
it
should
share
the
fate
of
alexander
body
and
remain
lost
forever
the
next
day
gave
us
another
trip
to
the
west
of
the
nile
not
again
in
the
burning
desert
but
only
as
far
as
the
ramesseum
and
then
to
see
the
colossi
seated
side
by
side
on
their
green
carpet
of
meadow
looking
out
past
the
centuries
toward
eternity
we
had
a
dance
on
board
that
night
and
next
morning
it
came
out
that
rachel
guest
who
had
disappeared
during
a
turkey
trot
and
a
castle
walk
had
got
herself
engaged
to
bailey
i
was
not
as
pleased
about
this
event
as
was
enid
biddell
who
now
saw
her
title
clear
to
harry
snell
for
i
had
bagged
willis
bailey
and
neill
sheridan
for
sir
marcus
in
order
to
gain
kudos
for
myself
but
biddy
appealed
to
consoled
me
by
saying
it
served
bailey
right
if
he
were
mercenary
and
that
both
men
would
have
come
in
any
case
the
third
day
was
to
be
the
great
day
for
us
the
day
big
with
fate
for
mabella
hânem
and
the
first
thing
that
happened
was
a
letter
sent
by
hand
from
the
bronsons
at
the
villa
sirius
they
had
arrived
the
fireworks
could
begin
chapter
xxi
the
opening
door
not
half
an
hour
after
the
first
word
from
bronson
came
another
hurried
note
an
unexpected
obstacle
had
cropped
up
so
confident
had
he
and
bronson
been
of
their
friends
cooperation
that
rather
than
put
such
important
matters
on
paper
they
had
waited
to
explain
by
word
of
mouth
the
owner
of
the
villa
was
a
rich
syrian
with
a
wife
he
was
a
copt
in
religion
hating
mohammedanism
in
general
and
the
father
of
rechid
bey
in
particular
this
had
seemed
to
the
american
consul
a
providential
combination
but
to
his
disgust
he
found
that
there
had
been
a
reconciliation
between
the
families
dimitrius
nekean
would
not
betray
the
bransons
confidence
but
he
could
not
allow
his
roof
to
be
used
as
a
shelter
for
rechid
runaway
wife
no
not
even
if
rechid
had
three
other
wives
in
his
harem
here
was
a
situation
and
as
monny
remarked
in
neat
american
slang
we
were
right
up
against
it
she
thought
that
if
antoun
and
i
put
our
heads
together
maybe
we
could
think
of
some
way
out
so
we
did
almost
literally
put
our
heads
together
across
a
table
no
bigger
than
a
handkerchief
in
my
cabin
and
decided
that
the
visit
to
rechid
harem
must
be
made
by
brigit
and
monny
in
the
late
afternoon
they
must
time
their
departure
from
the
house
at
about
the
hour
when
the
set
would
arrive
at
the
temple
of
mût
antoun
would
be
waiting
for
them
and
they
would
drive
in
a
closed
arabeah
to
the
temple
where
and
bronson
would
happen
to
be
sightseeing
if
mabella
hânem
had
been
rescued
she
would
then
be
put
in
charge
of
the
american
consul
whose
very
footprints
created
american
soil
around
him
as
far
as
his
shoes
could
reach
rechid
would
be
unlikely
to
search
at
the
temple
of
mût
nor
could
he
induce
any
arab
servant
to
accompany
him
there
after
sundown
we
would
escort
mabel
and
her
two
protectors
to
the
town
and
to
the
train
for
cairo
bronson
promising
to
take
the
girl
to
alexandria
whence
she
could
sail
for
home
it
was
the
best
plan
we
could
think
of
in
the
circumstances
and
monny
approved
it
though
her
patience
was
tried
by
having
to
wait
through
nearly
all
of
another
day
mabel
must
have
begun
to
believe
that
we
had
ignored
her
prayer
and
meant
to
do
nothing
i
argued
that
the
girl
would
believe
we
were
working
for
her
in
our
own
way
i
said
too
that
if
rechid
were
spying
his
suspicions
would
be
disarmed
by
seeing
us
go
the
ordinary
round
of
tourists
every
one
came
to
luxor
we
had
come
leisurely
by
river
and
were
sightseeing
every
moment
even
bedr
if
he
were
on
the
spot
intending
to
finish
his
revenge
as
neatly
as
it
had
been
begun
could
have
noticed
nothing
suspicious
in
our
actions
the
mention
of
bedr
in
this
connection
seemed
to
startle
biddy
and
i
was
sorry
i
had
let
his
name
slip
but
as
i
had
said
every
one
came
to
luxor
bedr
had
with
apparent
frankness
explained
that
he
was
travelling
up
the
nile
by
rail
with
his
two
clients
and
if
that
were
true
he
would
arrive
at
all
our
destinations
in
advance
of
us
probably
it
would
depend
on
the
clients
whether
they
lingered
at
luxor
long
enough
for
us
to
run
across
them
again
what
are
you
afraid
of
i
asked
biddy
when
i
had
a
chance
with
her
alone
even
if
bedr
is
a
spy
surely
you
kept
your
promise
and
left
that
bag
in
a
cairo
bank
it
was
a
promise
she
reminded
me
i
only
said
i
think
about
it
well
i
did
think
about
it
and
i
could
put
it
in
a
bank
i
told
you
it
was
the
sort
of
thing
one
put
in
banks
you
did
tell
me
what
it
was
i
mean
what
was
in
it
besides
money
no
i
could
will
you
now
oh
no
well
then
will
you
give
it
to
me
to
keep
till
we
get
back
to
cairo
no
but
duffer
dear
honestly
and
truly
it
is
for
myself
i
afraid
you
that
do
you
of
course
yet
if
people
are
believing
that
monny
gilder
is
rachel
guest
a
poor
little
school
teacher
then
no
one
who
heard
the
gossip
would
bother
to
risk
kidnapping
her
for
ransom
and
also
there
be
no
further
danger
of
those
you
fear
mistaking
her
for
oh
do
speak
the
name
i
was
going
to
i
was
merely
about
to
use
the
word
good
duffer
yours
is
a
consoling
argument
still
i
never
liked
bedr
or
wanted
him
with
us
and
even
now
there
seems
something
mysterious
about
rachel
thinking
so
much
of
him
as
if
there
were
a
secret
arrangement
between
them
you
know
i
never
got
over
that
or
understood
it
a
bit
he
flattered
miss
guest
perhaps
she
loves
flattery
but
she
made
her
market
now
and
all
through
monny
charity
she
could
want
to
do
her
benefactress
harm
i
suppose
not
unless
it
were
to
do
herself
good
do
those
eyes
of
hers
say
to
you
that
she
sacrifice
any
one
for
herself
i
been
thinking
more
about
a
different
pair
of
eyes
and
there
were
such
a
lot
of
men
crowding
round
rachel
for
some
reason
or
other
we
know
what
the
reason
was
as
she
and
monny
must
have
known
all
along
since
their
joke
together
began
ought
to
tell
bill
bailey
the
truth
no
my
dear
girl
i
must
draw
the
line
somewhere
i
gone
about
at
people
beck
and
call
telling
other
people
disagreeable
truths
till
i
a
physical
and
mental
wreck
bill
bailey
knows
all
about
statues
with
and
without
glass
eyes
let
him
find
out
for
himself
about
a
mere
girl
with
cat
eyes
biddy
snapped
if
one
triumph
leads
to
another
anthony
could
afford
to
be
hopeful
for
the
ending
of
our
stay
at
luxor
he
had
not
done
as
much
sightseeing
as
the
rest
of
us
but
when
we
had
been
asleep
in
our
beds
or
berths
dreaming
of
temples
or
of
each
other
he
had
been
out
whispering
and
listening
in
places
where
his
green
turban
opened
doors
and
hearts
he
had
traced
the
mysterious
trouble
to
its
source
and
learned
the
inner
history
of
that
regrettable
incident
which
like
a
dropped
match
had
lit
a
fire
hard
to
extinguish
a
party
of
young
men
travelling
with
a
bear
leader
had
laughed
at
some
arabs
prostrating
themselves
to
pray
at
that
sacred
moment
just
after
sunset
ordained
by
mohammed
lest
his
people
should
appear
to
worship
the
orb
itself
one
of
these
youths
fancying
himself
a
mimic
had
imitated
the
moslems
they
were
old
men
unable
to
resent
with
violence
what
they
thought
an
insult
to
their
religion
but
they
had
told
their
sons
and
the
story
had
spread
later
that
night
the
joyous
tourists
with
their
bear
leader
had
been
attacked
apparently
without
reason
on
coming
out
of
a
native
café
having
forgotten
the
sunset
prayer
they
honestly
believed
that
they
had
been
set
upon
by
men
to
whom
they
had
given
no
provocation
they
had
uttered
statements
and
complaints
and
disgusted
with
the
beastly
natives
had
pursued
their
journey
up
nile
visiting
their
grievances
on
the
innocent
and
making
more
mischief
at
each
stopping
place
murmured
threats
with
dark
looks
insulting
words
and
jostlings
of
strangers
by
the
inhabitants
of
upper
nile
villages
had
occasioned
anxiety
at
the
british
agency
it
had
proved
impossible
to
get
at
the
truth
and
the
influence
of
the
young
nationalists
had
been
suggested
our
hadji
had
now
turned
the
green
light
of
his
sacred
turban
upon
obscurity
and
those
in
power
at
cairo
would
know
how
to
set
about
repairing
damages
in
spite
of
private
anxieties
those
which
i
shared
and
others
which
i
did
share
but
suspected
i
think
anthony
was
happy
on
that
third
morning
at
luxor
he
must
have
been
tired
for
much
of
his
work
had
been
night
work
but
he
showed
no
fatigue
the
true
was
in
his
eyes
the
look
i
knew
far
better
than
the
new
and
strange
expression
which
had
said
to
me
lately
a
woman
has
come
to
be
of
importance
in
anthony
fenton
life
we
spent
our
morning
and
a
good
part
of
the
afternoon
at
karnak
lunching
irreverently
but
agreeably
in
the
shade
of
fallen
pillars
cambyses
or
the
great
earthquake
had
thrown
down
neill
sheridan
who
had
been
to
california
likened
the
ruddy
columns
of
the
great
hall
to
the
giant
redwoods
he
was
enjoying
karnak
because
there
was
practically
nothing
modern
and
ptolemaic
about
it
but
i
thought
how
quickly
he
would
lose
this
calmness
of
the
student
if
some
one
blurted
out
a
word
about
our
plan
for
that
evening
according
to
monny
he
had
been
taken
with
poor
mabella
hânem
on
board
the
laconia
admiring
her
so
frankly
that
rechid
had
banished
his
bride
to
her
cabin
if
sheridan
regretted
her
as
a
man
regrets
a
woman
vainly
loved
he
had
confided
in
no
one
not
even
monny
who
had
risked
seeming
to
seek
his
society
in
order
to
reach
the
secret
of
his
heart
he
had
however
been
graver
in
manner
than
at
first
so
said
the
girl
who
had
been
much
with
him
before
my
appearance
on
the
scene
whether
it
was
intuition
or
sheer
love
of
romance
which
inclined
her
to
the
opinion
she
believed
that
sheridan
was
unhappy
it
would
make
things
worse
for
mabel
if
our
scheme
failed
were
neill
sheridan
mixed
up
in
the
plot
therefore
even
impulsive
monny
admitted
the
wisdom
of
keeping
him
out
of
it
but
i
could
see
by
the
way
she
looked
at
him
almost
pityingly
when
he
discoursed
of
lotus
and
papyrus
columns
how
she
was
saying
to
herself
you
poor
fellow
if
only
you
the
thing
being
to
see
the
temple
of
luxor
at
sunset
we
gave
it
the
afternoon
as
if
condescending
to
do
it
a
favour
when
i
remembered
how
i
had
meant
to
linger
here
week
after
week
i
felt
that
i
was
paying
a
big
price
for
my
share
of
the
mountain
of
the
golden
pyramid
making
a
comedian
of
myself
rushing
through
halls
of
history
followed
by
a
procession
of
tourists
as
a
comet
tears
past
the
best
worth
seeing
stars
obediently
followed
by
its
tail
still
i
had
brigit
and
monny
as
bright
spots
in
the
tail
and
my
old
dreams
of
luxor
had
been
empty
of
them
these
ideas
were
in
my
mind
while
on
donkeys
and
in
arabeahs
we
dashed
as
if
our
lives
depended
on
speed
from
the
temple
of
karnak
to
the
temple
of
luxor
along
the
dusty
white
road
trimmed
with
sphinxes
this
description
was
enid
biddell
she
being
happy
and
therefore
frivolous
she
rode
with
harry
snell
as
queens
may
have
ridden
along
that
way
guarding
a
captive
prince
who
had
been
subdued
forever
sunset
illumined
the
world
as
for
a
new
year
festival
of
in
his
boat
of
gold
when
we
were
ready
to
leave
the
glorious
temple
and
turn
to
the
region
of
little
bazaars
and
big
hotels
fair
gardens
and
girls
with
tennis
rackets
whose
shape
reminded
our
minds
of
the
key
of
life
monny
and
brigit
had
slipped
away
their
day
was
just
beginning
my
heart
was
with
them
anthony
too
and
his
work
permitted
him
to
conduct
heart
along
the
way
that
they
must
take
while
i
had
to
conduct
the
set
to
the
winter
palace
hotel
and
give
them
tea
on
the
terrace
when
everybody
was
rested
and
had
had
enough
strawberry
tarts
view
and
flirtation
we
were
to
make
for
the
temple
of
mût
and
having
returned
at
last
to
the
were
to
steam
away
just
as
tourist
boats
and
dahabeahs
were
lighting
up
along
the
shore
we
were
to
dine
late
after
starting
and
anchor
in
some
dark
solitude
so
as
to
enjoy
a
peaceful
dogless
night
on
the
nile
but
what
would
have
happened
to
brigit
and
monny
before
the
sounding
of
that
dinner
gong
what
did
happen
at
the
beginning
i
must
tell
as
best
i
can
because
i
was
not
there
and
can
speak
for
myself
only
from
the
temple
of
mût
when
they
stole
almost
secretly
away
from
karnak
they
took
an
arabeah
which
was
waiting
and
drove
to
the
of
rechid
bey
this
place
of
his
is
not
prepared
for
a
lengthy
or
luxurious
residence
but
as
i
have
said
there
is
a
house
there
is
also
a
small
gatehouse
in
a
somewhat
neglected
condition
but
a
gatekeeper
was
there
the
usual
stout
negro
monny
and
biddy
were
quivering
with
fear
lest
they
should
be
refused
admission
as
at
asiut
but
this
time
their
coachman
was
ahmed
antoun
carefully
disguised
as
a
common
driver
of
an
arabeah
a
rather
exaggeratedly
common
driver
perhaps
for
his
face
and
turban
were
not
as
clean
as
the
face
and
turban
of
a
moslem
ought
to
be
he
had
been
helped
to
play
this
trick
by
one
of
the
secret
friends
he
had
made
in
some
café
or
other
the
cousin
of
an
uncle
of
a
brother
of
him
who
should
have
sat
on
the
box
seat
but
the
motive
he
had
alleged
was
not
the
real
one
the
two
beating
hearts
in
the
arabeah
had
confidence
in
him
if
the
gatekeeper
tried
to
send
them
away
antoun
would
bribe
him
or
threaten
him
with
black
magic
or
say
some
strange
word
which
would
be
for
them
as
an
open
sesame
the
fat
creature
at
the
gate
had
no
french
but
the
driver
of
the
arabeah
addressed
him
in
arabic
and
translated
his
answers
yes
the
great
lady
had
come
hither
with
her
husband
the
bey
word
should
go
to
her
it
should
be
ascertained
whether
it
was
her
pleasure
to
receive
these
friends
who
had
journeyed
from
a
far
country
to
pay
her
a
visit
monny
and
brigit
sat
in
the
arabeah
to
wait
but
they
dared
not
talk
to
the
driver
lest
some
spy
should
be
on
the
watch
where
every
group
of
flowering
plants
might
have
ears
and
eyes
even
if
the
big
gatekeeper
came
back
with
an
excuse
as
seemed
too
probable
there
was
hope
from
antoun
diplomacy
but
the
chances
were
two
to
one
against
success
rechid
bey
had
almost
certainly
been
put
upon
his
guard
by
the
revengeful
bedr
who
had
shown
himself
all
grinning
friendliness
to
us
rechid
might
have
tired
of
playing
dragon
as
antoun
prophesied
yet
it
would
be
strange
if
he
had
not
given
instructions
that
no
european
ladies
were
to
visit
his
wife
mabella
hânem
had
been
snatched
in
haste
from
asiut
but
if
she
were
still
in
luxor
with
her
husband
she
and
her
women
in
the
harem
would
be
guarded
by
eunuchs
as
in
the
more
ambitious
villa
which
rechid
called
his
home
i
suppose
anthony
slouching
on
the
box
seat
in
his
unattractive
disguise
must
have
been
as
much
astonished
as
monny
and
brigit
when
the
gatekeeper
returned
with
another
big
negro
to
say
that
the
ladies
would
be
welcomed
by
mabella
hânem
the
two
girls
were
wildly
delighted
fenton
emotions
were
mixed
he
wanted
to
save
the
american
bride
from
the
consequences
of
her
tragic
mistake
but
he
cared
more
for
his
friends
safety
than
for
hers
he
knew
that
monny
and
brigit
were
brave
and
that
monny
had
his
browning
but
the
thought
that
she
might
need
to
use
it
could
not
have
made
him
comfortable
on
the
box
seat
of
his
borrowed
arabeah
outside
rechid
gate
it
was
arranged
that
he
should
give
mabel
visitors
one
hour
thus
allowing
for
delays
and
emergencies
but
if
they
did
not
appear
at
the
end
of
that
time
he
would
dash
off
to
tell
the
luxor
police
that
two
ladies
were
detained
against
their
will
in
the
house
of
rechid
bey
once
in
charge
of
the
chief
eunuch
who
had
come
to
take
them
to
the
harem
brigit
and
monny
might
almost
as
well
have
been
deaf
and
dumb
brigit
knew
practically
nothing
of
arabic
and
monny
though
she
had
been
vaguely
studying
since
her
arrival
had
been
too
passionately
occupied
with
other
things
to
give
much
time
or
attention
to
the
language
of
egypt
invaders
her
blood
was
beating
in
her
veins
now
and
she
could
think
of
no
words
except
imshi
malish
and
these
buzzed
in
her
head
like
persistent
flies
as
she
and
biddy
followed
their
silent
and
turbaned
conductor
along
a
narrow
pink
path
toward
a
modern
villa
almost
shrouded
with
bougainvillia
and
they
were
the
last
words
she
needed
she
did
want
to
tell
the
ponderous
negro
to
get
out
on
the
contrary
she
wished
to
be
polite
so
far
from
saying
no
matter
everything
mattered
intensely
and
unfortunately
it
was
not
time
yet
to
bid
the
creature
farewell
behind
the
white
house
with
its
crimson
embroidery
of
flowers
rose
a
thick
growth
of
tall
the
shimmering
green
pale
as
beryl
in
the
dreaming
light
which
precedes
sunset
the
dark
red
of
the
bougainvillia
looked
like
streaming
blood
against
such
a
background
though
the
villa
appeared
to
be
comparatively
new
it
was
built
according
to
turkish
not
european
ideas
as
it
might
have
been
were
the
owner
a
copt
instead
of
a
mohammedan
the
building
was
in
two
parts
entirely
separating
the
from
the
the
latter
was
small
and
insignificant
compared
with
the
former
for
this
was
not
a
place
prepared
for
family
life
it
was
but
a
temporary
dwelling
where
the
master
would
more
often
come
alone
than
with
the
ladies
of
his
harem
the
eunuch
opened
a
door
leading
into
the
women
building
and
brigit
and
monny
entered
the
same
secretive
sort
of
vestibule
they
must
have
remembered
in
the
house
of
the
crocodile
a
prevented
them
from
seeing
what
was
beyond
and
the
dead
silence
frightened
them
a
little
so
easy
was
it
to
make
of
this
place
a
trap
in
the
vestibule
was
a
long
cheaply
cushioned
bench
the
of
the
women
custodian
and
upon
it
lay
spread
open
the
koran
which
he
had
deserted
to
meet
the
visitors
who
had
given
him
the
order
to
go
and
why
it
had
been
given
the
guests
began
to
ask
themselves
beyond
the
they
entered
an
anteroom
through
a
big
they
could
look
into
a
small
grassy
court
that
served
as
a
garden
and
opening
from
the
anteroom
was
a
second
room
much
larger
which
also
gave
upon
the
garden
court
at
the
door
of
this
the
eunuch
bowed
himself
away
but
an
involuntary
glance
which
monny
threw
at
him
over
her
shoulder
showed
that
he
was
grinning
the
grin
died
quickly
as
a
white
flash
of
fades
from
a
black
but
though
the
heavy
face
composed
itself
respectfully
there
remained
a
disquieting
twinkle
in
the
eyes
it
struck
monny
that
the
negro
was
amusing
himself
at
the
expense
of
the
visitors
because
of
something
he
knew
which
they
did
not
know
we
not
going
to
be
allowed
to
see
mabel
she
thought
with
a
jump
of
her
pulses
and
even
when
a
negress
smiling
invitingly
beckoned
her
and
biddy
into
the
large
room
whose
three
windows
looked
on
the
garden
she
still
believed
that
they
had
been
deceived
she
did
not
however
speak
out
her
conviction
to
brigit
nothing
could
be
done
yet
they
must
wait
and
see
what
would
happen
the
room
was
furnished
in
abominable
taste
with
cheap
trench
furniture
upholstered
with
blue
brocade
that
clashed
hideously
with
the
scarlet
carpet
there
were
several
sofas
and
chairs
stiffly
arranged
round
the
walls
but
no
tables
save
low
maidahs
of
carved
wood
inlaid
with
pearl
such
as
they
had
seen
in
cairo
bazaars
and
hotels
the
windows
were
closed
and
the
air
heavy
as
in
a
room
seldom
used
the
two
seated
themselves
close
together
on
one
of
the
ugly
sofas
facing
a
door
through
which
the
beckoning
negress
had
gone
out
there
was
no
sound
except
the
harsh
ticking
of
a
huge
bulbous
clock
all
gilding
and
flowers
which
stood
in
a
corner
monny
and
eyes
met
with
a
question
who
would
open
the
door
just
closed
would
it
be
mabel
or
would
rechid
bey
stride
in
to
reproach
or
insult
them
you
sure
it
biddy
whispered
no
need
for
monny
to
ask
what
she
meant
sure
she
answered
the
handle
of
the
door
turned
chapter
xxii
the
driver
of
an
arabeah
thank
god
cried
biddy
as
a
slim
figure
in
a
loose
white
robe
framed
itself
in
the
doorway
with
a
sob
mabel
ran
toward
them
both
hands
held
out
and
in
an
instant
she
was
being
hugged
and
kissed
and
cooed
over
you
found
me
you
come
she
cried
i
never
dared
think
you
would
when
rushed
me
away
from
asiut
he
said
he
would
keep
me
here
all
the
rest
of
my
life
to
punish
me
for
complaining
to
you
but
how
did
he
know
monny
asked
did
your
tell
him
about
the
letter
i
do
think
so
unless
he
has
made
her
confess
it
was
like
this
he
was
coming
to
his
place
here
on
business
i
felt
so
thankful
it
seemed
providential
he
should
be
away
then
just
when
you
were
starting
up
nile
i
was
almost
happy
that
morning
when
suddenly
he
appeared
again
and
i
was
ordered
to
put
on
a
habberah
and
yashmak
and
travel
with
him
yeena
the
woman
who
acts
as
my
maid
had
to
get
ready
in
a
hurry
too
the
chief
eunuch
a
hateful
hypocritical
wretch
followed
some
clothes
have
been
sent
to
me
since
but
not
many
at
first
i
guess
what
had
happened
and
was
in
such
a
fiendish
temper
i
dare
ask
questions
it
was
till
after
we
arrived
that
he
explained
i
sure
he
took
pleasure
in
hurting
me
he
said
that
he
left
home
early
the
morning
he
was
going
to
luxor
because
he
meant
to
stop
and
make
a
business
call
on
the
way
to
the
depot
otherwise
he
would
have
been
able
to
rush
home
and
fetch
me
as
he
did
and
still
be
in
time
to
catch
his
train
after
the
warning
it
was
some
dragoman
you
employed
in
cairo
he
told
me
who
had
seen
us
getting
off
the
and
who
ran
after
his
carriage
in
the
street
in
asiut
the
wicked
creature
warned
him
that
you
were
all
there
and
that
he
heard
you
say
something
which
sounded
as
if
there
were
a
plot
to
get
at
me
just
at
that
minute
by
the
worst
of
luck
sheridan
passed
you
know
how
foolish
and
cruel
was
about
sheridan
on
the
ship
well
he
had
forgotten
so
he
turned
round
and
almost
snatched
me
out
of
the
house
rather
than
i
should
be
left
in
asiut
with
him
away
this
is
exactly
what
we
thought
must
have
happened
exclaimed
monny
that
beast
bedr
and
to
think
that
rachel
and
i
wasted
our
time
trying
to
convert
him
how
i
wish
i
had
let
aunt
clara
engage
him
at
alexandria
she
thought
he
come
from
a
man
with
her
favourite
name
antony
but
she
would
have
insisted
if
i
had
encouraged
her
i
feel
as
if
this
trouble
were
partly
my
fault
and
if
i
had
been
thoughtless
enough
at
asiut
to
blurt
out
your
husband
name
you
not
to
blame
for
anything
dearest
biddy
tried
to
comfort
her
it
was
your
unfailing
resolve
to
help
which
has
brought
us
here
you
both
my
good
angels
said
mabel
oh
it
heavenly
to
see
you
but
i
ca
understand
why
i
allowed
to
after
all
the
threats
and
punishments
i
afraid
i
shall
be
made
to
pay
somehow
he
loves
to
torture
me
and
he
knows
how
i
believe
he
hates
me
now
he
begun
to
realize
that
i
give
anything
to
leave
him
that
i
do
consider
myself
his
wife
if
he
hates
you
why
is
he
willing
to
let
you
go
monny
questioned
her
partly
because
he
very
vain
and
it
would
humiliate
him
partly
because
he
has
no
son
yet
only
that
horrid
little
brown
girl
and
set
his
heart
on
a
boy
who
to
possess
all
the
qualities
and
strength
of
the
west
no
he
wo
let
me
go
well
you
do
it
in
spite
of
him
then
said
monny
eagerly
what
we
here
for
we
shall
take
you
with
us
you
must
say
to
your
servants
that
we
invited
you
to
drive
and
you
accepted
nothing
in
that
to
make
them
suspect
lots
of
turkish
ladies
go
driving
and
motoring
with
european
women
in
cairo
and
you
can
have
that
fat
black
man
sit
on
the
box
seat
with
with
our
coachman
if
it
would
make
things
easier
taking
him
to
guard
you
he
can
be
hustled
or
bribed
or
something
when
the
right
time
comes
to
get
rid
of
him
never
fear
oh
it
going
to
be
a
glorious
adventure
and
at
the
end
of
it
you
be
free
nobody
could
blame
you
as
the
man
has
another
wife
mabella
hânem
shook
her
head
you
splendid
to
plan
this
but
too
late
it
was
too
late
from
the
moment
that
dragoman
warned
my
husband
why
you
been
allowed
to
come
into
the
house
and
talk
with
me
i
ca
think
unless
is
watching
and
listening
through
a
hidden
spyhole
there
sure
to
be
secret
reason
in
his
head
anyhow
a
reason
that
for
good
and
not
mine
and
i
shall
not
be
able
to
get
out
if
you
do
we
do
echoed
biddy
a
catch
in
her
voice
she
glanced
furtively
at
monny
what
had
we
all
been
dreaming
of
when
we
let
this
beautiful
girl
run
into
danger
i
know
biddy
well
enough
to
be
sure
that
her
thought
at
that
instant
was
for
monny
gilder
not
brigit
but
the
fear
in
her
heart
was
vague
until
the
next
answer
mabel
made
an
answer
that
came
almost
with
calmness
for
mabella
hânem
whole
being
was
concentrated
upon
herself
and
her
own
imbroglio
everything
else
everybody
else
even
these
friends
who
were
risking
much
to
help
her
were
secondary
considerations
i
do
suppose
real
harm
will
come
to
you
i
do
see
how
and
yet
there
may
be
something
on
foot
three
men
had
come
one
who
might
be
a
dragoman
and
two
europeans
they
came
together
i
saw
them
and
i
have
seen
them
go
away
they
in
the
men
part
of
the
house
the
they
must
be
with
my
husband
perhaps
there
only
some
business
about
the
sugarcane
but
did
you
see
the
men
distinctly
biddy
asked
in
a
changed
tone
yes
quite
distinctly
for
they
glanced
up
at
the
window
where
i
was
peeping
out
of
course
they
could
see
me
through
the
wooden
lattice
and
the
bougainvillia
but
i
had
a
good
look
at
them
the
dragoman
seemed
to
have
one
blind
eye
oh
i
had
thought
of
before
can
it
be
the
man
who
gave
the
warning
what
were
the
europeans
like
biddy
questioned
without
answering
were
they
wearing
light
tweed
knickerbockers
with
big
checks
no
they
were
in
dark
clothes
not
very
noticeable
had
one
a
scar
on
his
forehead
why
yes
i
believe
he
had
the
eyes
of
brigit
and
monny
met
but
there
was
none
of
that
deadly
fear
in
the
girl
which
biddy
was
trying
to
keep
out
of
hers
even
now
it
was
hardly
fear
for
herself
it
was
nearly
all
for
monny
but
monny
must
not
know
lest
she
should
lose
her
nerve
when
it
was
needed
most
that
idea
of
brigit
about
monny
being
mistaken
for
esmé
by
members
of
the
organization
betrayed
had
seemed
foolish
and
far
fetched
although
esmé
was
hidden
from
her
enemies
near
monaco
and
it
was
at
monaco
that
miss
gilder
and
rachel
guest
and
east
had
joined
brigit
on
the
i
had
laughed
at
the
suggestion
and
biddy
had
been
to
make
it
but
now
in
this
lonely
house
where
she
and
the
girl
had
been
unexpectedly
welcomed
in
this
house
where
the
master
watched
entertaining
three
strange
men
the
thought
did
not
appear
quite
so
foolish
quite
so
far
fetched
indeed
biddy
marvelled
why
it
had
occurred
to
none
of
us
that
one
of
the
dangers
to
be
run
in
rescuing
mabel
might
come
through
bedr
the
same
danger
which
had
perhaps
threatened
in
the
house
of
the
crocodile
too
late
to
think
of
this
now
the
fact
remained
that
we
had
not
thought
of
it
when
there
was
time
not
even
biddy
had
felt
certain
that
there
was
a
secret
motive
for
taking
the
girls
to
the
hasheesh
den
or
that
bedr
had
been
guilty
of
anything
worse
than
indiscretion
his
warning
to
rechid
bey
we
had
put
down
to
a
petty
desire
for
revenge
to
pay
us
out
for
his
discharge
though
biddy
had
never
felt
sure
of
his
new
employers
german
origin
and
though
she
had
had
qualms
at
sight
of
the
party
following
or
arriving
before
us
on
our
pilgrimage
through
the
desert
and
up
the
nile
she
had
never
associated
their
possible
designs
with
rechid
bey
grudge
against
us
yet
how
obvious
that
bedr
should
take
advantage
of
it
for
his
clients
sake
if
those
two
men
were
what
she
sometimes
feared
brigit
had
never
spoken
out
to
monny
what
was
in
her
mind
about
esmé
she
had
known
that
monny
would
laugh
and
perhaps
say
what
fun
for
the
girl
had
invited
biddy
to
egypt
because
she
attracted
adventures
and
because
monny
badly
needed
a
few
her
life
having
been
up
to
the
date
of
starting
a
kind
of
fruit
and
flower
piece
in
a
neat
frame
now
perhaps
monny
laugh
but
it
was
not
the
time
to
speak
of
new
dangers
well
if
your
husband
thinks
that
creatures
like
bedr
and
his
germans
are
going
to
help
him
stop
us
from
getting
out
or
taking
you
out
wrong
said
monny
stoutly
bedr
the
most
sickening
coward
as
rachel
guest
and
i
have
reason
to
remember
but
i
glad
we
know
what
we
have
to
expect
are
you
biddy
it
was
hard
to
answer
because
the
girl
was
in
reality
so
far
from
knowing
what
she
might
have
to
expect
brigit
tried
to
smile
her
reply
as
monny
began
to
tell
mabel
something
of
their
plan
about
the
friends
ready
to
rally
round
them
once
they
were
in
the
carriage
waiting
outside
the
gate
and
about
the
motor
coat
and
veiled
hood
which
had
been
brought
for
mabel
to
put
on
at
a
safe
distance
from
the
house
you
have
to
start
in
your
own
things
the
girl
was
saying
otherwise
your
servants
would
think
it
odd
ring
now
dear
for
your
woman
and
have
her
give
you
your
habberah
and
yashmak
there
are
no
bells
said
mabella
hânem
with
her
soft
air
of
obstinate
hopelessness
when
i
want
yeena
if
she
is
in
the
room
i
clap
my
hands
as
hard
as
i
can
but
i
tell
you
it
is
no
use
it
is
too
late
as
she
spoke
throwing
up
her
arms
and
letting
them
fall
with
a
gesture
of
helpless
despair
both
brigit
and
monny
felt
that
islam
had
already
raised
a
barrier
between
them
and
this
delicate
creature
it
had
taken
into
its
keeping
in
the
white
wool
robe
she
wore
the
kind
of
loose
dressing
gown
affected
by
turkish
women
she
looked
more
like
a
circassian
than
an
american
girl
always
she
had
seemed
to
her
rescuers
a
charming
doll
a
feminine
thing
of
exactly
the
type
which
would
appeal
to
a
turk
weary
of
dark
beauties
her
hair
was
so
very
golden
her
eyes
so
very
big
and
blue
her
lashes
so
very
black
her
mouth
so
very
red
and
small
but
now
she
had
become
an
odalisque
mabel
friends
realized
that
she
would
do
nothing
to
save
herself
they
must
do
all
hesitating
no
longer
monny
struck
her
hands
loudly
together
yeena
did
not
come
the
girl
clapped
again
and
yet
again
till
her
palms
smarted
but
nothing
happened
yeena
is
in
it
whatever
they
mean
to
do
said
mabel
she
had
her
orders
very
well
then
monny
persisted
her
eyes
shining
and
her
cheeks
carnation
you
must
go
without
your
wraps
come
along
do
be
frightened
is
it
better
to
risk
something
to
get
away
than
to
stay
here
alone
when
we
gone
the
pretty
doll
with
a
little
moan
gave
herself
up
to
her
friends
brigit
as
well
as
monny
realized
that
the
moment
had
come
they
must
take
her
while
she
was
in
this
mood
let
me
go
ahead
said
monny
in
a
low
firm
voice
you
know
why
brigit
did
know
why
monny
had
anthony
browning
and
she
alone
understood
the
use
of
it
yes
she
must
lead
the
way
yet
brigit
longed
to
fling
herself
in
front
to
make
of
her
body
a
shield
for
the
tall
white
girl
she
had
never
so
loved
and
admired
biddy
put
mabel
in
front
of
her
and
behind
monny
keeping
her
between
them
with
two
cold
but
determined
little
hands
on
the
shrinking
shoulders
and
so
pushing
her
along
protected
front
and
rear
in
the
piteous
procession
of
course
if
the
door
leading
toward
the
house
entrance
had
been
locked
on
the
outside
there
would
have
been
the
end
of
the
endeavour
for
the
moment
but
it
opened
to
monny
hand
and
all
three
went
on
unchecked
until
they
came
to
the
vestibule
where
on
the
wall
bench
they
had
seen
the
koran
of
the
fat
negro
awaiting
his
return
they
had
come
tiptoeing
and
had
made
no
more
sound
than
prowling
kittens
yet
he
sat
there
facing
the
door
no
longer
heavy
lidded
a
black
mountain
of
lazy
flesh
but
alert
beady
eyed
as
if
he
had
been
counting
the
minutes
as
they
swept
through
the
doorway
hoping
to
surprise
him
the
eunuch
jumped
to
his
feet
as
lightly
as
a
man
of
half
his
weight
and
smiling
with
pleasure
in
the
excitement
of
an
event
to
break
monotony
he
blocked
with
his
great
bulk
the
aperture
between
wall
and
projecting
screen
no
wonder
they
had
not
needed
to
lock
doors
with
this
giant
for
a
jailer
and
a
big
sudanese
knife
conspicuously
showing
in
a
belt
under
his
open
galabeah
rechid
had
perhaps
wanted
the
white
mouse
in
his
trap
to
feel
the
thrill
of
hope
and
then
the
shock
of
disappointment
he
had
counted
completely
on
the
guardian
of
his
harem
but
though
he
had
chosen
an
american
wife
he
had
not
counted
on
the
courage
of
another
type
of
american
girl
the
knife
looked
terrible
but
it
was
sheathed
and
tucked
into
a
belt
anthony
browning
was
in
hand
and
hidden
only
under
her
serge
coat
out
it
came
with
a
warning
click
of
the
trigger
and
with
an
astonished
frightened
gurgle
in
his
throat
the
negro
involuntarily
fell
back
run
monny
breathed
prisoning
him
where
he
stood
with
the
little
bright
eye
of
the
browning
cocked
up
at
his
face
she
had
to
be
obeyed
then
and
they
ran
the
two
of
them
flashing
past
the
black
man
touching
his
clothes
as
they
squeezed
by
yet
he
dared
not
put
out
a
detaining
hand
when
they
were
away
safe
or
not
she
could
not
tell
monny
still
kept
the
pistol
in
position
but
began
slowly
to
turn
that
she
too
might
pass
the
dragon
holding
him
at
her
mercy
till
the
end
not
a
word
of
arabic
could
she
recall
but
the
browning
spoke
for
her
a
language
understood
without
the
trouble
of
learning
by
all
the
sons
of
adam
when
she
had
backed
through
the
doorway
the
girl
still
faced
toward
the
inner
vestibule
and
it
was
well
she
did
so
for
scarcely
was
she
out
of
his
sight
before
the
black
giant
was
after
her
taking
the
chance
that
she
would
have
turned
to
run
but
there
was
the
resolute
young
face
with
eyes
defying
his
and
there
was
the
weapon
ready
to
blow
out
such
brains
as
he
had
if
the
hand
on
the
knife
moved
again
he
fell
back
and
then
monny
did
run
making
the
best
use
she
had
ever
made
of
those
long
limbs
which
gave
her
the
air
of
a
young
diana
she
ran
until
she
had
caught
up
with
the
other
two
flying
toward
the
distant
gate
for
something
told
her
that
the
negro
would
have
hurried
to
tell
his
master
of
the
trick
the
women
had
played
preferring
the
lash
on
his
back
perhaps
to
a
bullet
through
his
head
she
was
right
no
doubt
to
trust
her
instinct
for
the
eunuch
did
not
pursue
though
his
tale
of
failure
was
not
needed
rechid
bey
had
been
watching
from
a
window
of
the
selâmlik
as
mabel
his
wife
had
watched
when
he
received
visitors
he
did
not
wait
for
the
negro
warning
but
dashed
out
of
the
house
followed
and
then
passed
by
several
men
in
arab
dress
the
faces
of
these
were
almost
hidden
by
the
loose
hoods
which
desert
men
pull
over
their
heads
in
a
high
wind
but
had
they
been
uncovered
the
women
would
not
have
seen
them
the
thing
was
to
escape
not
to
take
note
of
the
pursuers
and
it
was
only
biddy
looking
over
her
shoulder
for
monny
who
even
saw
that
they
were
followed
she
cried
out
to
her
friend
to
hurry
that
some
one
was
coming
that
they
must
get
to
the
gate
or
all
would
be
ended
then
feeling
mabel
falter
she
held
her
more
tightly
and
ran
the
faster
rechid
and
his
companions
were
shouting
not
to
the
women
but
to
the
gatekeeper
and
as
the
master
furious
voice
rang
out
just
in
front
of
the
fugitive
all
three
together
now
appeared
the
big
form
of
the
man
at
the
gate
monny
did
not
know
what
to
do
for
in
whichever
direction
she
faced
with
the
browning
she
could
be
captured
from
the
other
she
might
kill
the
negro
and
then
turn
to
keep
the
pursuers
back
but
the
thought
of
killing
a
man
sickened
her
she
had
meant
only
to
threaten
not
to
take
life
suddenly
she
felt
afraid
of
the
browning
she
hesitated
in
a
wild
second
of
confusion
hating
herself
for
failing
her
friends
yet
unable
to
decide
or
act
but
hardly
had
the
gatekeeper
sprung
in
sight
than
he
went
down
flat
on
his
face
struck
in
the
back
of
the
neck
by
the
shabby
fellow
who
had
driven
their
carriage
go
on
the
arab
said
in
french
there
some
one
else
to
drive
you
follow
i
armed
the
three
sped
by
him
as
he
stood
aside
to
let
them
pass
showing
to
monny
a
pistol
which
matched
the
one
he
had
lent
her
this
consoled
the
girl
in
obeying
for
as
antoun
had
trusted
her
courage
in
this
adventure
so
did
she
trust
his
and
his
strength
and
wit
against
four
men
or
four
dozen
men
if
need
were
there
was
the
waiting
arabeah
and
there
on
the
box
was
a
much
cleaner
more
arab
to
drive
it
than
the
soiled
figure
which
had
left
the
horses
and
strayed
into
the
garden
afterwards
they
learned
that
the
new
man
was
the
sister
cousin
uncle
of
the
hadji
café
acquaintance
he
had
been
engaged
to
stroll
past
in
the
road
stop
speak
offer
the
gatekeeper
a
cigarette
drift
into
conversation
and
be
ready
to
jump
onto
the
box
seat
the
instant
antoun
left
it
his
instructions
included
furious
driving
with
the
three
ladies
once
they
had
bundled
into
the
arabeah
to
the
temple
of
mût
rechid
bey
had
every
right
according
to
his
own
point
of
view
to
resent
the
kidnapping
of
his
wife
and
to
get
her
back
in
any
way
he
could
even
if
blood
had
to
be
spilt
but
his
companions
they
who
were
muffled
in
the
cloaks
and
hoods
to
save
their
faces
from
the
sharp
wind
had
perhaps
not
the
same
right
or
interest
in
any
case
when
they
saw
that
the
women
had
a
man
or
men
to
help
them
and
that
so
helped
they
had
passed
from
the
privacy
of
the
garden
to
the
publicity
of
the
road
the
three
fell
back
publicity
it
may
be
did
not
please
them
or
else
thinking
to
have
only
women
to
deal
with
they
were
not
armed
and
did
not
like
the
look
of
the
pistol
rechid
evidently
no
coward
or
past
feeling
fear
in
rage
at
the
failure
of
his
counterplot
ran
on
wheezing
slightly
he
was
fat
for
his
age
toward
the
erect
arab
and
the
prostrate
negro
beast
devil
he
panted
breathlessly
and
cried
out
other
words
of
evil
import
in
both
turkish
and
arabic
threatening
the
silent
man
of
the
pistol
with
death
and
things
even
worse
but
before
he
had
gone
far
the
hooded
men
caught
up
with
him
and
surrounding
urged
him
back
what
they
said
anthony
could
not
hear
or
what
he
said
in
return
but
he
thought
they
were
proposing
some
plan
which
appealed
to
rechid
reason
for
he
showed
signs
of
yielding
there
was
now
no
longer
anything
to
detain
the
protector
of
the
ladies
for
by
this
time
he
hoped
and
believed
that
their
arabeah
must
be
far
on
its
way
toward
the
temple
of
mût
the
agreed
upon
accordingly
he
stepped
over
the
unconscious
gatekeeper
who
lay
with
his
nose
in
the
grass
and
backed
calmly
out
of
the
garden
not
far
off
an
arabeah
was
crawling
along
the
road
so
slowly
that
one
might
have
thought
the
driver
half
asleep
but
this
supposition
would
have
done
him
an
injustice
dusk
had
fallen
now
the
purple
dusk
which
drops
like
a
curtain
just
after
the
pageant
of
sunset
is
finished
yet
the
driver
was
wide
enough
awake
to
pierce
the
purple
with
a
pair
of
sharp
eyes
and
recognize
a
figure
expected
he
whipped
up
his
horse
and
the
dirty
arab
running
to
meet
it
in
a
few
seconds
the
latter
was
on
the
box
beside
the
coachman
then
the
arabeah
turned
and
dashed
wildly
off
according
to
the
custom
of
arabeahs
back
in
the
direction
whence
it
had
been
crawling
the
two
men
in
the
vehicle
talked
rapidly
in
low
voices
speaking
the
language
not
only
of
the
country
but
the
of
luxor
itself
your
brother
passed
you
in
his
arabeah
yes
hadji
he
passed
with
the
three
european
ladies
you
told
me
had
been
in
secret
to
visit
their
friend
then
anthony
knew
that
brigit
and
monny
had
been
able
already
to
carry
out
their
plan
of
wrapping
mabella
hânem
in
one
of
their
own
cloaks
this
was
well
and
would
save
gossip
if
the
occupants
of
the
arabeah
were
stared
at
by
passers
by
and
at
the
temple
also
it
would
be
well
for
if
possible
the
set
were
to
know
nothing
now
or
later
of
the
adventure
but
though
anthony
was
glad
of
the
news
he
had
got
from
this
arab
ordered
to
meet
him
at
the
gate
he
did
not
settle
down
comfortably
and
say
to
himself
thank
goodness
the
thing
is
over
those
men
back
there
in
the
garden
would
not
so
easily
have
persuaded
rechid
bey
to
let
his
wife
go
unpursued
if
they
had
not
offered
some
alternative
plan
that
could
be
carried
out
quickly
still
so
far
so
good
brigit
and
monny
had
won
out
and
secured
the
prize
as
anthony
had
prophesied
that
they
would
do
they
were
on
their
way
to
the
temple
where
i
would
be
with
the
comfortable
commonplace
crowd
from
the
and
where
the
american
consul
and
his
wife
would
just
happen
also
to
be
wandering
instead
of
driving
straight
there
himself
anthony
went
with
a
friend
to
an
obscure
house
in
the
village
when
he
came
out
of
that
house
his
face
was
no
longer
disfigured
with
dirt
it
was
as
immaculate
as
noble
as
the
proudest
hadji
face
should
be
and
above
it
was
wound
the
green
turban
ahmed
antoun
effendi
own
dignified
robes
of
the
egyptian
gentleman
flowed
round
his
tall
figure
when
once
more
he
took
his
place
in
the
waiting
arabeah
this
time
not
on
the
box
seat
and
drove
off
at
more
furious
speed
than
ever
toward
the
temple
of
mût
chapter
xxiii
bengal
fire
the
temple
of
mût
i
think
must
always
be
mysterious
even
by
day
that
night
it
was
more
than
mysterious
it
was
sinister
darkness
shut
us
in
among
the
pillars
and
the
black
statues
the
least
imaginative
of
my
charges
seemed
to
feel
the
influence
of
the
place
not
an
arab
not
even
the
superior
boat
dragoman
would
come
inside
with
us
because
after
the
sun
has
set
dethroned
sekhet
comes
into
her
own
again
strange
stories
are
whispered
by
arabs
of
the
temple
of
mût
and
of
the
ghostly
golden
dahabeah
that
once
a
year
sails
slowly
by
to
a
faint
sound
of
music
on
the
sacred
lake
we
had
brought
candles
with
us
protected
by
smoky
glass
from
the
wind
that
swept
down
the
avenue
of
broken
sphinxes
outside
and
hissed
like
angry
cats
through
the
dark
courts
lined
with
granite
statues
of
the
yet
despite
the
mystery
or
because
of
it
people
seemed
curiously
happy
the
spirit
of
the
past
of
old
egypt
touched
them
in
the
shadowy
spaces
of
this
ruined
temple
brushed
them
with
its
wings
and
whispered
words
into
their
ears
they
talked
to
each
other
in
low
tones
as
if
not
to
miss
the
whispers
or
the
soft
footfalls
of
unseen
things
and
they
did
not
laugh
and
make
jokes
or
ask
silly
questions
according
to
their
irritating
custom
i
blessed
this
mood
for
my
nerves
were
jangled
more
than
ever
after
the
bronsons
unobtrusively
appeared
waiting
for
brigit
and
monny
to
come
wondering
if
they
would
come
or
what
we
should
do
if
they
did
because
suddenly
in
this
place
of
gloom
and
eloquent
silence
all
the
clever
little
plans
anthony
and
i
had
made
in
case
of
accident
seemed
futile
how
could
we
have
let
those
two
walk
alone
into
a
trap
i
blamed
myself
i
blamed
anthony
and
sometimes
i
gave
the
wrong
answers
to
east
who
walked
with
me
trying
to
keep
out
of
the
way
of
the
crowd
she
was
anxious
to
talk
of
her
niece
and
to
relate
how
she
had
been
singing
my
praises
to
monny
you
must
be
discouraged
she
said
never
mind
about
the
hieroglyphic
letter
oh
no
you
need
worry
i
have
told
her
it
was
yours
better
let
her
think
what
she
thought
at
first
did
she
you
what
she
thought
answer
me
lord
ernest
i
do
mind
your
knowing
that
i
believed
it
was
from
antoun
to
me
believing
so
did
no
harm
why
should
it
to
me
or
to
him
i
soon
guessed
that
there
was
a
mistake
somewhere
when
he
did
follow
the
letter
up
i
was
not
offended
by
the
proposal
as
monny
would
have
been
oh
not
if
she
known
it
was
but
if
she
supposed
antoun
was
making
love
to
her
do
you
see
you
must
have
seen
you
so
quick
and
observant
that
she
been
caught
by
the
romance
of
him
just
as
she
was
afraid
she
might
be
by
some
thrilling
prince
when
she
came
to
egypt
she
miserable
she
hating
herself
and
you
save
her
though
i
prepared
her
mind
so
what
you
meant
when
you
hinted
that
i
could
spare
her
humiliation
i
said
half
in
laughter
half
in
bitterness
suddenly
able
to
concentrate
my
mind
upon
the
talk
do
you
think
a
man
would
want
a
girl
to
take
him
for
such
a
reason
when
she
caring
for
some
one
else
but
if
it
would
be
impossible
for
her
to
marry
the
some
one
else
why
should
it
be
impossible
she
would
think
it
impossible
would
she
if
i
checked
myself
but
east
understood
instantly
if
he
has
a
secret
she
said
then
none
of
us
has
a
right
to
suggest
it
to
her
every
man
for
himself
lord
ernest
in
antoun
effendi
has
no
reason
too
feel
too
kindly
to
monny
you
be
robbing
your
friend
of
if
you
speak
to
her
if
he
in
with
any
one
it
is
my
niece
at
least
it
not
perhaps
it
biddy
after
all
my
thoughts
interpolated
to
care
for
monny
would
be
beneath
his
dignity
considering
all
passed
and
you
can
make
happy
as
well
as
yourself
by
taking
my
advice
east
went
on
are
you
going
to
be
sensible
just
then
came
a
murmur
expressing
surprise
or
some
other
new
emotion
from
one
of
the
outer
courts
where
the
crowd
wandered
cleopatra
having
lured
me
yes
lured
the
word
into
the
sanctuary
itself
something
has
happened
i
said
let
go
back
and
see
what
it
is
perhaps
antoun
has
come
east
caught
me
up
eagerly
he
was
coming
was
he
when
he
finished
his
business
or
maybe
it
only
monny
and
brigit
monny
and
brigit
in
the
hope
of
seeing
antoun
cleopatra
turned
her
back
upon
the
dreary
sanctuary
not
unwillingly
even
though
the
burning
question
was
left
unanswered
i
hurried
her
through
the
dark
passages
which
lay
between
us
and
the
courts
lighting
our
way
with
a
candle
and
it
was
all
i
could
do
not
to
cry
out
aloud
thank
heaven
or
hurrah
or
something
else
that
would
have
opened
people
eyes
when
i
saw
that
indeed
brigit
and
monny
had
arrived
it
was
rachel
guest
and
willis
bailey
who
had
hailed
them
from
afar
as
candlelights
flashed
across
their
faces
and
suddenly
to
my
eyes
the
gloomy
temple
seemed
to
be
brilliantly
illuminated
i
do
know
exactly
how
i
contrived
to
leave
cleopatra
and
get
to
the
newcomers
but
i
did
get
to
them
in
less
than
a
minute
perhaps
i
was
a
little
rude
to
east
i
was
thinking
of
that
at
the
time
however
nor
of
her
i
separated
the
two
i
wanted
from
the
others
their
faces
radiated
excitement
but
i
was
not
sure
if
it
meant
success
i
was
sure
only
that
they
had
been
through
an
ordeal
and
were
feeling
the
reaction
you
safe
i
said
and
shook
hands
with
them
feverishly
then
i
shook
hands
all
over
again
safe
yes
monny
answered
and
mabel
why
do
you
ask
about
her
oh
lord
ernest
we
done
it
we
done
it
thanks
to
antoun
effendi
we
should
have
failed
at
the
last
if
it
had
been
for
him
just
look
over
there
at
the
bronsons
and
see
if
you
can
guess
who
it
is
they
talking
to
i
looked
and
saw
tall
thin
bronson
and
short
plump
bronson
trying
to
form
a
hollow
square
around
a
little
figure
in
a
long
gray
coat
of
biddy
and
a
hood
with
a
veil
i
remembered
her
wearing
the
day
we
motored
to
heliopolis
it
seemed
about
a
hundred
years
ago
i
had
conducted
so
much
and
so
violently
since
but
i
was
not
too
old
to
remember
biddy
hood
what
if
neill
sheridan
poking
about
alone
with
a
candle
could
see
through
that
veil
triumph
i
exclaimed
you
heroines
i
did
know
then
how
true
were
my
own
words
was
it
a
great
adventure
biddy
the
girl
asked
half
shyly
of
her
friend
so
great
that
i
ca
talk
about
it
brigit
answered
and
her
eyes
implored
mine
not
to
ask
questions
also
they
said
that
she
had
things
to
tell
me
not
now
but
by
and
by
things
for
me
alone
biddy
eyes
could
be
wonderful
where
antoun
effendi
monny
broke
in
when
i
had
taken
hint
and
was
beginning
to
say
that
we
must
go
and
speak
to
the
bronsons
he
has
come
yet
i
answered
and
then
her
eyes
too
began
to
implore
not
come
yet
but
it
a
long
time
we
found
and
bronson
outside
hoping
for
us
to
arrive
and
we
talked
to
them
and
introduced
mabel
and
explained
things
they
would
have
liked
to
go
and
take
her
away
quickly
but
biddy
and
i
begged
them
not
to
we
said
it
would
be
better
to
wait
for
the
rest
and
all
the
crowd
to
be
together
in
case
of
trouble
oh
we
discussed
everything
for
ages
minutes
and
minutes
i
do
think
antoun
effendi
ought
to
be
here
unless
i
caught
her
up
quickly
unless
well
you
see
we
left
him
inside
rechid
gate
where
he
just
knocked
down
a
big
negro
and
was
keeping
back
rechid
and
of
other
men
anyhow
three
with
a
pistol
not
the
one
he
lent
me
he
told
us
to
go
so
we
went
he
told
them
to
go
so
they
went
a
change
this
for
the
gilded
rose
she
spoke
at
the
moment
like
an
obedient
little
girl
if
he
told
you
to
go
it
was
all
right
you
may
be
sure
i
said
encouragingly
but
despite
my
faith
in
anthony
as
a
fighting
man
i
felt
well
somewhat
dismayed
at
the
picture
called
up
rechid
and
anyhow
three
men
it
was
rather
a
large
order
if
with
a
wish
i
could
have
sent
every
member
of
the
set
back
to
their
peaceful
homes
in
england
and
america
and
thus
rid
myself
of
them
in
a
second
they
would
all
have
found
themselves
walking
in
at
their
respective
front
doors
i
wished
this
wish
but
having
a
mere
smoking
candle
in
my
hand
and
not
aladdin
lamp
it
did
work
there
they
inconveniently
remained
in
the
temple
of
mût
looking
twice
as
large
as
life
what
if
i
tell
them
they
seen
everything
i
muttered
they
have
but
that
a
detail
if
i
could
rush
all
back
to
the
boat
and
you
with
them
of
course
and
get
mabella
hânem
and
the
bronsons
off
safely
i
could
go
look
for
anth
for
antoun
of
course
we
were
to
wait
for
him
but
i
do
like
the
picture
you
painted
oh
look
for
him
broke
in
monny
leave
us
to
take
care
of
ourselves
i
sure
we
can
there
are
enough
of
us
and
bronson
is
a
go
and
get
the
police
i
ca
leave
you
i
said
antoun
would
be
the
last
one
to
forgive
me
if
i
did
that
but
i
start
off
the
party
now
the
arabeahs
and
donkeys
are
waiting
listen
to
the
stentorian
voice
of
the
conductor
announcing
i
tried
to
speak
gayly
but
the
announcement
which
i
opened
my
mouth
to
roar
through
the
temple
was
never
made
there
came
instead
at
that
instant
a
rival
roar
from
outside
mine
would
have
been
the
roar
of
a
sucking
dove
this
other
was
a
wild
bull
roar
of
rage
what
it
was
for
who
was
making
it
and
whether
it
concerned
us
we
did
not
know
but
it
was
the
sound
of
many
voices
and
flowing
to
us
on
the
wind
driving
nearer
out
of
distance
it
was
startling
and
caused
the
heart
to
miss
a
beat
suddenly
the
thought
sprang
into
my
mind
that
this
was
like
something
in
a
theatre
we
were
on
the
stage
in
a
play
of
ancient
egypt
and
a
mob
of
supers
was
yelling
for
our
lives
in
the
wings
they
would
pour
out
upon
the
stage
and
attack
us
only
the
hero
and
heroine
would
be
saved
all
the
villains
and
other
unnecessary
people
would
be
polished
off
everybody
had
stopped
talking
involuntarily
groups
drew
together
we
looked
over
our
smoking
candles
past
the
standing
statues
and
the
fallen
statues
away
toward
the
columns
of
the
temple
entrance
and
bronson
and
the
girl
in
biddy
veiled
hood
and
cloak
walked
across
the
court
and
joined
our
party
of
three
neill
sheridan
was
at
a
distance
his
prophetic
soul
told
him
nothing
i
hope
that
fellow
rechid
bey
has
worked
up
any
trouble
against
us
the
american
consul
from
asiut
said
in
a
low
somewhat
worried
tone
instantly
i
was
certain
that
what
he
hoped
had
not
happened
was
indeed
the
thing
that
had
happened
i
seemed
to
see
rechid
stirring
up
a
crowd
of
his
fellow
mussulmans
telling
them
that
dogs
of
christians
had
robbed
him
of
his
foreign
wife
who
was
on
the
point
of
accepting
islam
nothing
easier
than
for
rechid
to
find
us
all
luxor
knew
we
were
in
the
temple
of
mût
these
men
of
luxor
and
other
nile
towns
of
upper
egypt
had
not
yet
settled
down
after
the
outburst
against
christian
insults
which
had
alarmed
the
authorities
in
cairo
in
three
days
anthony
fenton
had
discovered
the
dregs
at
the
bottom
of
the
teapot
and
had
doubtless
done
something
toward
calming
the
tempest
in
it
but
the
troubled
water
had
not
time
to
cool
it
could
easily
be
brought
to
the
boil
again
and
the
despoiling
of
a
harem
by
europeans
the
harem
of
an
important
man
would
be
oil
thrown
onto
the
dying
fire
under
the
tempestuous
teapot
the
furious
voices
grew
louder
from
the
wave
of
sound
words
spattered
out
and
up
like
spray
perhaps
in
all
that
astonished
crowd
gathered
in
the
temple
of
mût
bronson
and
i
were
the
only
ones
who
knew
enough
arabic
to
catch
their
meaning
his
question
was
answered
and
this
was
not
a
stage
those
shouting
men
were
not
supers
in
the
wings
they
were
in
earnest
foolish
and
dreamlike
and
utterly
unreal
as
it
seemed
their
hearts
were
hot
with
savage
anger
against
men
and
women
of
an
alien
race
and
though
what
they
might
do
to
us
would
be
visited
on
their
own
heads
they
were
not
thinking
of
now
as
for
us
it
was
just
possible
that
owing
to
this
silly
dream
we
were
having
about
a
mob
of
common
uneducated
arabs
for
some
of
us
there
might
not
be
any
is
there
a
back
door
where
we
can
dash
out
and
give
them
the
slip
asked
bronson
i
was
thinking
hard
mine
was
the
responsibility
for
my
charges
these
rich
comfortable
tourists
from
london
and
new
york
birmingham
and
manchester
chicago
and
st
louis
none
of
them
knew
yet
that
they
were
in
danger
they
were
thinking
about
their
dinner
and
their
pleasant
lighted
cabins
on
board
the
waiting
for
them
not
far
away
they
realized
that
something
was
the
matter
out
there
that
a
lot
of
arabs
were
making
a
row
but
it
interested
and
amused
them
impersonally
if
somebody
had
robbed
or
murdered
somebody
else
morally
it
was
a
pity
of
course
but
it
added
to
the
picturesqueness
of
the
scene
and
would
be
nice
to
tell
about
at
home
i
felt
myself
overflowing
with
a
sudden
new
tenderness
for
the
set
so
often
troublesome
this
that
was
going
to
happen
unless
we
could
stop
it
was
in
truth
the
affair
of
monny
and
brigit
mabella
hânem
and
the
bronsons
anthony
fenton
and
me
but
all
would
be
involved
the
innocent
with
the
guilty
unless
very
quickly
the
duffer
of
the
company
could
think
of
some
way
out
no
i
heard
myself
say
with
decision
we
must
leave
the
temple
they
superstitious
about
it
few
if
any
will
venture
in
what
they
want
is
to
lure
us
into
the
open
and
there
must
be
no
panic
certainly
my
friend
unless
he
been
hurt
is
working
for
us
somewhere
only
a
question
of
minutes
he
borrowed
my
browning
i
wish
i
glanced
toward
brigit
and
monny
they
stood
at
a
little
distance
with
bronson
and
mabel
but
the
faces
of
both
were
turned
toward
us
i
saw
that
they
guessed
the
meaning
of
the
uproar
outside
biddy
great
soft
eyes
spoke
to
mine
spoke
and
told
me
all
the
truth
about
myself
how
i
loved
her
biddy
and
no
one
else
on
earth
how
i
would
die
for
her
and
let
all
the
rest
die
if
need
be
yes
even
monny
gilder
to
whom
i
had
been
idiot
enough
to
write
that
letter
if
i
could
save
biddy
what
did
anything
beside
matter
but
yes
it
did
matter
i
must
save
them
all
and
the
light
that
had
lit
up
my
dim
soul
gave
me
inspiration
because
i
loved
biddy
i
knew
what
to
do
i
got
a
little
surprise
for
every
one
i
yelled
to
be
heard
over
the
noise
outside
where
rechid
bey
mob
was
now
probably
trying
to
make
our
and
join
in
the
fight
or
the
siege
neill
sheridan
will
kindly
lead
the
whole
party
to
the
sanctuary
which
his
knowledge
of
architecture
will
enable
him
to
find
on
the
axis
of
the
temple
down
that
passage
please
in
fifteen
minutes
the
surprise
will
be
ready
and
you
will
receive
the
signal
to
return
from
bronson
american
consul
at
asiut
no
time
for
introductions
now
sheridan
amazed
but
perhaps
not
displeased
emerged
from
the
dark
corner
where
until
the
row
began
he
had
been
examining
a
come
along
then
everybody
he
shouted
and
as
the
procession
formed
discussing
the
surprise
and
the
noise
now
mysteriously
linked
together
in
the
minds
of
my
charges
i
saw
the
veiled
and
hooded
mabel
shyly
try
to
pull
bronson
into
place
with
her
as
near
as
possible
to
sheridan
she
must
have
suspected
that
there
was
trouble
brewing
and
guessed
the
cause
her
timid
little
soul
instinctively
sought
shelter
in
the
neighbourhood
of
a
friend
who
would
perhaps
have
been
more
than
a
friend
if
he
could
so
she
followed
him
he
not
knowing
what
eyes
the
gray
veil
hid
but
bronson
broke
away
from
the
small
hand
and
hurried
back
to
her
husband
what
am
i
to
do
she
asked
go
with
the
others
he
said
quietly
take
care
of
the
girl
lord
ernest
has
some
plan
she
went
reluctantly
but
brigit
and
monny
and
east
lingered
at
the
tail
of
the
procession
returning
to
us
as
the
others
vanished
down
the
passage
that
led
toward
the
sanctuary
i
motioned
them
away
but
monny
ran
forward
while
biddy
kept
cleopatra
from
following
they
talked
together
and
argued
biddy
arm
round
the
taller
woman
waist
as
monny
came
straight
to
me
and
put
into
my
hand
anthony
pistol
i
did
have
to
use
it
she
said
it
all
loaded
and
ready
and
i
going
to
stay
here
with
you
and
bronson
to
help
what
are
you
planning
to
do
please
run
away
i
said
and
take
biddy
and
your
aunt
you
must
that
the
only
help
we
want
not
till
you
tell
me
what
you
mean
to
do
oh
only
to
try
a
trick
to
frighten
those
arab
sheep
out
there
they
funk
this
temple
at
night
anyhow
and
i
just
remembered
that
i
brought
some
bengal
fire
to
light
the
place
up
and
amuse
the
crowd
i
thought
if
a
red
blaze
suddenly
burst
out
it
would
give
those
fellows
a
scare
and
the
police
are
on
the
way
but
the
arabs
will
see
that
you
only
two
they
sha
see
us
at
all
we
hide
behind
those
statues
and
pot
at
them
if
they
do
come
in
which
i
doubt
now
off
with
the
three
of
you
and
i
was
getting
my
illumination
ready
to
my
surprise
and
relief
monny
obeyed
without
further
argument
dimly
it
passed
through
my
mind
that
she
had
been
profiting
by
her
lessons
lately
i
threw
one
glance
over
my
shoulder
more
i
afraid
to
see
whether
my
dear
brigit
were
on
her
way
to
safety
than
through
anxiety
for
miss
gilder
the
three
figures
had
already
disappeared
in
the
darkness
and
bronson
and
i
gave
ourselves
to
the
work
of
lighting
up
an
of
voices
surged
round
the
temple
entrance
now
but
the
red
light
flamed
like
the
fires
of
hell
and
i
peeping
from
behind
a
statue
revolver
in
hand
saw
that
the
temple
itself
had
not
been
invaded
the
flare
lit
the
foreground
of
the
darkness
outside
and
the
columns
of
the
front
court
i
could
see
a
moving
throng
of
white
and
black
clad
figures
gesticulating
running
to
and
fro
seeming
to
urge
each
other
to
some
action
yet
none
coming
forward
i
sprinkled
on
more
powder
and
up
blazed
the
bengal
fire
again
now
somebody
was
taking
the
lead
a
tall
man
was
pushing
through
the
crowd
would
they
follow
this
brave
one
my
fingers
closed
round
the
browning
he
was
between
the
columns
at
last
but
the
light
was
dying
down
i
threw
on
all
i
had
of
the
powder
and
stared
through
the
red
dazzle
to
make
certain
what
was
happening
since
this
might
decide
our
fate
the
tall
man
back
was
turned
to
us
he
seemed
to
be
motioning
the
crowd
away
instead
of
urging
them
on
how
to
make
sure
in
the
glare
whether
a
man
turban
was
white
or
green
or
crimson
but
that
gesture
that
lift
of
the
head
no
mistaking
that
the
man
was
antoun
ahmed
antoun
the
worshipful
hadji
haranguing
the
mob
hardly
would
they
let
him
speak
at
first
those
on
the
outskirts
tried
to
yell
him
down
i
heard
the
word
traitor
and
before
the
light
ebbed
i
thought
i
caught
sight
of
rechid
pale
face
under
the
red
tarboosh
rechid
broad
shoulders
in
european
coat
edging
past
jebbahs
and
galabeahs
toward
the
columns
then
just
as
the
light
died
from
behind
us
in
the
temple
came
a
cry
above
the
shouting
of
the
hadji
who
was
beginning
to
make
himself
heard
by
the
crowd
it
rang
out
shrill
and
clear
a
woman
voice
monny
gilder
she
called
on
the
name
of
antoun
and
then
was
silent
i
lifted
my
all
that
was
left
to
illumine
the
darkness
and
saw
at
the
far
end
of
the
court
shadowy
figures
struggling
together
it
seemed
to
me
that
there
were
not
two
but
four
or
five
i
ran
toward
them
and
bronson
ran
but
some
one
bounded
past
us
both
a
tall
man
in
a
green
turban
a
shot
was
fired
after
him
and
hit
a
statue
i
heard
subconsciously
a
miniature
crash
of
chipped
granite
but
i
do
think
anthony
heard
or
had
heard
anything
since
that
call
for
antoun
he
had
dashed
ahead
though
we
had
had
the
start
and
were
running
fast
rounding
a
group
of
statues
erect
and
fallen
i
saw
a
on
the
floor
and
knew
that
monny
and
perhaps
biddy
had
not
obediently
followed
the
procession
to
the
sanctuary
after
all
they
had
waited
to
watch
and
listen
hiding
behind
the
black
statues
of
sekhet
and
men
who
had
crept
in
by
another
way
doubtless
by
the
small
ptolemaic
gate
opening
on
the
lake
had
taken
them
by
surprise
anthony
had
got
to
the
shadowy
mass
which
moved
like
black
clouds
vague
and
shapeless
before
bronson
and
i
were
near
enough
to
distinguish
one
form
from
another
as
for
our
eyes
his
tall
figure
blended
with
the
waving
shadows
two
revolver
shots
exploded
with
thunderous
reverberations
we
did
not
know
if
he
or
another
had
fired
but
almost
simultaneously
with
the
second
shot
two
black
shapes
separated
themselves
from
the
rest
fleeing
into
darkness
they
took
the
way
by
which
they
must
have
come
the
way
leading
toward
the
gate
on
the
lake
three
seconds
later
we
were
on
the
spot
and
the
only
shadows
left
resolved
themselves
under
my
candle
light
into
the
forms
of
brigit
monny
gilder
anthony
fenton
and
east
somewhat
in
the
background
monny
hat
was
off
and
biddy
was
apparently
hanging
by
a
hatpin
their
hair
was
in
disorder
a
rope
of
biddy
falling
over
one
shoulder
a
shining
braid
of
monny
hanging
down
her
back
monny
seemed
to
be
more
or
less
in
the
arms
of
antoun
but
only
vaguely
and
by
accident
dimly
i
gathered
that
she
had
stumbled
and
he
had
saved
her
from
falling
biddy
was
fastening
up
the
front
of
her
gray
chiffon
blouse
which
was
open
and
torn
her
hands
trembled
and
i
could
see
that
her
breast
rose
and
fell
convulsively
for
though
the
light
was
dim
i
was
looking
at
her
while
i
merely
glanced
at
the
others
east
was
crying
but
brigit
and
monny
had
smiles
for
bronson
and
me
as
we
came
blundering
along
stumbling
over
unseen
obstacles
some
one
stole
up
behind
with
an
electric
torch
and
tried
to
drag
me
away
said
monny
in
a
weak
little
voice
scarcely
at
all
like
her
own
it
sounded
as
if
a
ventriloquist
were
imitating
her
some
one
called
me
esmé
whispered
right
in
my
ear
and
i
screamed
and
fought
and
antoun
came
i
think
then
the
man
pushed
me
down
as
he
ran
away
anyhow
i
fell
and
antoun
picked
me
up
oh
biddy
are
you
safe
why
your
dress
is
torn
yes
but
i
safe
answered
another
small
weak
voice
i
fought
too
i
i
think
they
wanted
to
rob
me
thank
goodness
i
did
have
it
on
the
bag
dearest
yes
darling
the
bag
i
thought
i
would
wear
it
out
in
the
night
the
yells
had
subsided
since
the
hadji
harangue
if
not
wholly
because
of
it
the
police
have
come
said
anthony
it
occurred
to
me
that
rechid
and
some
friends
of
his
were
cooking
up
a
plan
and
while
i
was
getting
into
my
clothes
in
the
village
it
jumped
into
my
head
what
it
might
be
so
on
my
way
out
to
the
temple
i
stopped
and
left
a
warning
we
all
right
now
and
i
do
think
the
arab
lot
would
have
dared
venture
in
anyhow
these
chaps
who
sneaked
in
at
the
back
and
attacked
the
ladies
were
dressed
like
the
rest
but
i
doubt
they
were
arabs
he
would
have
doubted
still
more
if
he
had
known
all
that
i
knew
but
the
one
secret
i
kept
from
him
was
biddy
secret
the
words
esmé
whispered
to
monny
as
yet
meant
nothing
save
bewilderment
to
fenton
the
fifteen
minutes
are
up
and
no
signal
yet
for
your
famous
surprise
called
out
sir
john
biddell
complaining
voice
from
the
end
of
a
dark
passage
has
anything
gone
wrong
oh
i
was
going
to
give
you
a
bengal
fire
illumination
of
the
temple
for
a
climax
i
explained
coming
suavely
forward
to
meet
him
with
my
candle
but
the
beastly
stuff
er
sort
of
went
off
by
itself
and
it
all
used
up
i
was
er
just
going
to
call
you
well
not
much
harm
done
said
sir
john
we
seen
the
sanctuary
such
as
it
is
a
little
disappointing
perhaps
especially
as
sheridan
found
a
friend
with
bronson
the
consul
wife
and
preferred
talking
with
her
to
giving
out
information
to
us
from
his
stores
of
knowledge
but
luckily
not
more
than
twenty
minutes
wasted
by
the
way
what
become
of
the
row
outside
seems
to
have
fizzled
down
while
we
were
away
like
your
red
fire
yes
a
great
man
of
some
sort
was
addressing
the
crowd
but
the
police
came
along
and
made
it
move
on
there
been
a
bit
of
native
grumbling
in
these
nile
towns
lately
you
may
have
read
some
paragraph
about
it
in
the
cairo
papers
so
the
police
are
rather
quick
to
break
up
meetings
why
should
men
meet
near
the
temple
of
mût
inquired
sir
john
should
think
of
doing
it
perhaps
in
the
beginning
they
hoped
to
get
something
out
of
the
europeans
said
i
lightly
but
they
given
that
up
evidently
i
hope
they
have
seduced
our
and
arabeah
drivers
exclaimed
sir
john
i
hungry
and
i
in
a
hurry
to
get
home
not
they
and
are
easily
seduced
when
there
a
question
of
baksheesh
all
right
i
only
sorry
about
the
bengal
fire
well
it
was
a
good
idea
anyhow
sir
john
patronized
me
i
heard
murmur
in
his
chosen
language
the
hadji
who
had
saved
the
situation
une
idée
très
bien
pour
duffer
chapter
xxiv
playing
heavy
father
to
rachel
never
had
the
looked
so
enchanting
to
my
eyes
as
she
looked
that
night
i
felt
as
the
set
trooped
on
board
like
an
anxious
who
contrary
to
her
fears
has
safely
returned
a
brood
of
ducklings
to
the
home
after
a
swim
out
to
sea
i
valued
each
duckling
even
the
least
downy
far
more
than
i
had
dreamed
it
would
be
possible
but
there
was
one
duckling
valued
so
much
more
than
all
the
rest
how
much
more
i
had
realized
only
when
cackling
on
the
bank
i
saw
it
on
the
wave
that
knowing
it
was
safe
made
me
hysterical
with
joy
i
could
have
kissed
its
napkin
when
it
slid
off
its
lap
and
i
picked
it
up
the
napkin
not
the
duck
at
dinner
the
drawback
was
that
i
had
not
saved
it
as
anthony
had
saved
monny
it
had
no
reason
to
be
grateful
to
me
or
care
more
than
it
had
always
cared
for
a
friend
and
still
another
drawback
presented
itself
when
the
confusion
of
dressing
in
haste
and
dining
as
the
steamed
out
of
luxor
gave
me
time
to
think
the
duckling
was
not
my
duckling
and
considering
that
it
had
calmly
laid
plans
for
me
to
capture
an
heiress
considering
also
that
it
had
not
yet
abandoned
these
plans
i
saw
little
reason
to
hope
that
now
i
had
come
to
a
few
just
a
few
of
my
senses
it
would
ever
take
the
idea
seriously
of
becoming
mine
to
abandon
once
and
forever
the
duckling
simile
the
first
thing
i
did
on
board
the
boat
after
recovering
from
the
excitement
of
seeing
mabel
off
by
train
with
the
bronsons
was
to
wonder
how
i
could
make
up
for
all
this
hideous
waste
of
time
when
i
might
have
been
making
love
to
biddy
but
there
was
no
chance
to
say
anything
personal
to
her
that
night
i
had
to
hear
and
wanted
to
hear
the
story
of
all
that
had
happened
from
the
moment
she
and
monny
entered
rechid
bey
gate
to
the
moment
they
came
out
then
there
was
antoun
story
to
follow
and
after
that
we
had
to
compare
notes
how
everybody
had
felt
what
everybody
had
thought
what
everybody
had
done
this
subject
was
inexhaustible
and
kept
cropping
up
in
the
midst
of
others
but
that
of
mabella
hânem
her
escape
from
bondage
and
from
conversion
to
islam
and
what
revenge
rechid
was
likely
to
take
was
almost
as
engrossing
when
at
last
late
that
evening
i
managed
to
get
biddy
alone
for
a
moment
she
could
no
more
be
induced
to
talk
of
herself
than
if
she
had
been
a
ghost
without
visible
existence
a
mere
voice
to
speak
of
others
monny
by
preference
what
a
heroine
monny
had
been
from
first
to
last
and
what
did
i
think
about
the
foolishness
of
that
theory
the
theory
that
bedr
was
a
spy
and
had
led
his
employers
to
believe
that
jones
was
travelling
with
her
stepdaughter
concealed
under
an
impeccably
important
de
what
i
thought
was
that
we
must
get
hold
of
miss
rachel
guest
and
question
her
as
to
her
whole
acquaintance
with
the
armenian
learning
how
by
all
that
was
incredible
the
double
mystery
of
mixed
names
had
originated
monny
knows
only
that
rachel
was
supposed
to
be
the
heiress
testing
her
personal
attractions
by
pretending
to
be
the
poor
school
teacher
said
brigit
the
child
been
wildly
enjoying
the
situation
for
she
was
tired
of
young
men
rachel
was
and
been
profiting
by
it
far
more
wickedly
as
for
esmé
i
sure
no
thought
of
her
name
coming
into
this
business
ever
entered
head
we
must
try
to
find
out
what
bedr
said
to
rachel
at
the
beginning
as
you
advise
duffer
and
all
about
it
after
what
i
told
you
that
i
heard
from
esmé
about
an
exciting
love
romance
any
mistake
of
sort
might
be
particularly
dangerous
the
organization
might
think
it
had
more
right
than
ever
to
be
bitter
against
us
and
now
i
do
mind
your
confiding
in
your
friend
captain
fenton
i
think
like
him
to
know
my
story
what
biddy
had
told
me
about
esmé
was
that
the
girl
had
confessed
in
a
letter
having
been
made
love
to
during
a
summer
holiday
in
the
mountains
with
friends
by
the
son
of
a
man
her
father
had
deeply
injured
the
accidental
meeting
had
been
a
real
romance
the
girl
and
the
young
man
thought
that
no
one
save
themselves
shared
their
secret
but
who
could
tell
when
fate
itself
stood
between
them
with
a
drawn
sword
the
love
of
romeo
for
juliet
was
a
safe
and
simple
affair
compared
with
the
merest
flirtation
between
the
daughter
of
richard
and
the
son
of
john
halloran
whom
testimony
had
sent
to
prison
for
life
sometimes
i
thought
as
the
days
went
on
that
biddy
guessed
not
my
change
of
heart
but
my
new
understanding
of
it
and
that
she
wanted
quietly
and
gently
to
show
me
according
to
bill
bailey
pet
expression
there
was
nothing
doing
her
expressed
wish
that
fenton
should
hear
her
story
looked
to
my
suddenly
suspicious
mind
as
if
his
strong
personality
and
his
extremely
picturesque
position
had
made
an
appeal
to
the
romance
in
her
as
it
had
in
the
case
of
east
and
perhaps
monny
gilder
always
interested
in
jones
from
first
sight
when
he
had
laughingly
said
that
the
little
sprite
of
a
woman
would
be
almost
too
alluring
if
surrounded
by
an
atmosphere
of
mystery
and
intrigue
anthony
was
now
frankly
preoccupied
with
her
affairs
he
was
not
even
annoyed
that
unaided
by
me
her
quick
mind
had
grasped
the
secret
of
his
identity
it
was
like
her
to
spring
on
to
it
by
instinct
he
said
smiling
that
thoughtful
smile
of
his
which
was
more
than
ever
effective
in
his
arab
get
up
and
like
her
not
to
give
anybody
else
a
hint
except
you
of
course
though
she
must
have
been
tempted
sometimes
i
suppose
and
he
looked
up
quickly
she
given
any
one
else
a
hint
i
swear
she
has
miss
gilder
you
sure
she
has
the
slightest
suspicion
as
sure
as
a
man
can
be
of
anything
about
a
woman
you
are
trying
to
evade
the
question
duffer
on
my
word
i
not
i
feel
morally
certain
miss
gilder
labours
under
the
impression
that
you
as
brown
as
you
painted
that
somehow
or
other
you
ca
be
moslem
because
she
seen
you
without
a
turban
and
you
got
the
hair
of
a
christian
maybe
she
thinks
you
a
copt
i
heard
her
learnedly
arguing
the
other
day
that
the
copts
are
the
only
egyptians
she
has
the
air
of
studying
you
sometimes
but
with
all
her
study
she
sees
you
only
as
an
egyptian
of
high
birth
and
attainments
with
a
few
drops
of
european
blood
in
your
veins
perhaps
just
enough
to
make
things
aggravating
and
a
vague
right
to
a
princely
position
if
you
chose
to
overlook
something
or
other
and
claim
it
there
you
have
her
conception
of
you
in
a
nutshell
there
would
still
have
been
room
in
that
nutshell
for
cleopatra
ideas
concerning
her
niece
feelings
but
if
she
were
right
it
was
anthony
business
to
discover
those
feelings
for
himself
provided
he
cared
to
do
so
and
of
this
i
was
not
sure
there
was
the
doubt
that
it
might
be
biddy
even
though
he
appeared
to
attach
some
unexplained
importance
to
miss
gilder
continued
ignorance
about
himself
the
day
after
leaving
luxor
there
was
no
time
for
the
heart
to
heart
talk
i
planned
with
rachel
guest
each
hour
each
minute
almost
was
taken
up
with
my
duties
as
conductor
which
i
was
obliged
to
regard
seriously
whether
i
liked
them
or
not
if
i
did
not
the
set
growled
snapped
or
clamoured
which
gave
me
even
more
trouble
than
doing
my
duty
for
some
reason
best
known
to
herself
but
suspected
by
me
east
kept
to
her
suite
nursing
a
grievance
and
the
siberian
from
asiut
this
saved
me
a
certain
amount
of
brain
strain
for
among
other
places
of
interest
we
had
to
pass
near
was
ancient
hermonthis
where
in
her
cleopatra
incarnation
she
had
built
a
temple
with
a
portrait
of
herself
adoring
the
patron
bull
of
the
city
if
she
had
known
how
easy
it
would
be
to
visit
the
ruins
she
would
have
been
capable
of
desiring
the
boat
to
stop
or
telegraphing
complaints
to
sir
marcus
if
it
had
the
two
excitements
of
the
day
were
passing
through
a
huge
lock
with
sides
like
those
of
a
canyon
and
scarlet
doors
such
as
might
adorn
the
house
of
an
ogre
in
which
we
nearly
stuck
and
were
saved
by
antoun
seizing
the
pole
from
the
inferior
hands
of
a
nubian
boatman
also
a
visit
to
esneh
a
very
coptic
town
starred
with
convents
built
by
the
saint
helena
sacred
once
to
the
latos
fish
now
sacred
to
gorgeous
baskets
of
every
size
and
colour
also
somewhat
and
a
ruined
quay
jutted
into
the
water
where
roman
inscriptions
could
have
been
spied
out
if
any
one
had
had
eyes
to
spare
from
the
basket
sellers
the
sellers
of
and
all
the
other
shouting
merchants
who
flocked
to
head
us
off
on
our
way
to
the
temple
despite
a
flurry
of
rain
that
freckled
the
deep
sand
of
the
landing
hill
but
nobody
did
have
eyes
for
anything
roman
now
that
cleopatra
sulked
in
her
and
our
only
archeologist
was
as
as
if
he
had
been
his
own
astral
body
he
had
seen
the
wisdom
of
sticking
to
the
trip
and
not
turning
back
by
train
with
the
bronsons
and
somebody
else
as
he
may
have
yearned
to
do
if
monny
were
right
but
history
had
suddenly
become
as
dry
husks
to
sheridan
his
soul
was
no
longer
with
us
journeying
up
the
nile
and
i
suspected
his
body
of
packing
to
join
it
as
soon
as
things
had
been
arranged
to
mabel
and
send
her
freed
from
a
marriage
which
was
not
marriage
freed
from
this
fear
or
forcible
conversion
home
to
the
united
states
it
was
just
on
the
cards
anthony
and
i
thought
that
there
might
be
another
demonstration
at
esneh
that
unruly
town
where
mohammed
ali
banished
the
superfluous
dancing
girls
of
cairo
in
the
eighteen
forties
if
rechid
bey
had
not
discovered
the
truth
about
that
hurried
departure
from
luxor
for
asiut
as
a
matter
of
fact
mabel
and
her
guardians
were
almost
thrown
on
board
as
the
train
began
to
move
he
might
have
sent
emissaries
or
come
himself
to
esneh
where
he
must
have
known
the
would
land
as
for
bedr
and
his
employers
anthony
who
now
knew
biddy
suspicions
was
inclined
to
think
that
even
if
she
were
right
we
had
seen
the
last
of
them
after
such
a
setback
as
that
in
the
temple
of
mût
he
thought
they
would
not
only
be
discouraged
but
frightened
they
had
run
away
from
us
in
the
temple
and
despite
the
proverb
concerning
those
who
fight
and
run
to
fight
another
day
it
was
probable
that
men
of
their
calibre
would
see
the
wisdom
of
abandoning
the
chase
they
had
shown
themselves
cowards
anthony
thought
whatever
their
object
had
been
in
attacking
miss
and
miss
gilder
and
though
we
must
be
on
the
watch
during
the
rest
of
the
trip
his
idea
was
that
the
men
had
retreated
in
fear
of
arrest
in
any
case
we
had
no
trouble
at
esneh
and
saw
no
sinister
faces
peering
out
of
low
doorways
in
the
bazaars
or
over
the
heads
of
the
pretty
sometimes
fair
and
dancing
girls
descendants
buried
in
the
heart
of
the
village
we
came
upon
the
temple
only
the
portico
was
visible
under
piled
houses
and
a
triumphant
mosque
but
once
we
were
down
in
the
entombed
temple
itself
it
gave
a
sense
of
secrecy
and
mystic
rites
to
look
up
from
under
the
dark
roof
of
heavy
stone
with
its
painted
zodiac
out
from
hidden
halls
of
carving
and
colour
to
the
clustered
houses
of
dried
brick
built
before
the
temple
was
uncovered
there
was
a
sense
of
tragedy
and
failure
too
toiling
up
the
steep
slope
to
the
town
level
and
passing
on
the
walls
gigantic
carved
figures
making
thwarted
gestures
in
commemoration
of
kingly
triumphs
forgotten
hundreds
upon
hundreds
of
years
ago
at
night
there
was
on
board
with
our
boatmen
dancing
each
other
down
like
highlanders
and
the
next
day
brought
us
to
edfu
which
all
the
women
were
wild
to
see
because
robert
hichens
had
called
its
the
true
colour
of
love
an
adorable
temple
sacred
to
horus
as
there
he
conquered
and
killed
set
it
was
only
after
we
had
passed
sir
ernest
cassell
red
house
with
the
smoky
irrigation
works
where
fourteen
hundred
arabs
have
chased
the
desert
into
the
background
and
after
we
had
visited
the
splendid
twin
temples
of
light
and
darkness
at
kom
ombo
towering
majestically
above
the
nile
bank
that
i
found
time
to
catechize
and
lecture
miss
guest
i
contrived
to
separate
her
from
her
sculptor
and
lure
her
to
a
part
of
the
deck
unfrequented
because
it
was
windy
rachel
was
looking
happy
young
and
prosperous
in
one
of
monny
most
becoming
and
expensive
dresses
at
first
i
think
she
felt
inclined
to
be
flattered
by
my
desire
for
her
society
for
i
had
never
yet
wished
her
joy
or
formally
congratulated
bailey
one
look
into
my
eyes
with
those
clever
slanting
green
orbs
of
hers
however
and
instinct
must
have
told
her
that
my
intention
was
different
she
glanced
round
for
an
excuse
to
escape
but
found
none
for
i
hedged
her
in
from
all
her
friends
then
she
quickly
decided
to
shunt
me
off
on
an
emergency
track
laid
by
herself
what
a
wonderful
day
it
been
she
remarked
and
kom
ombo
is
one
of
the
best
temples
the
only
thing
i
did
like
was
those
mummied
crocodiles
their
smiles
look
so
hypocritical
and
to
think
been
smiling
them
for
thousands
of
years
it
must
be
unpleasant
to
smile
the
smile
of
a
hypocrite
even
for
a
few
weeks
i
seized
the
chance
to
work
up
to
business
yes
indeed
agreed
miss
guest
a
slight
colour
staining
her
cheeks
and
did
you
notice
several
new
sorts
of
yes
i
admitted
but
if
you
do
mind
i
like
to
skip
sixteen
or
seventeen
centuries
and
come
down
to
you
i
been
wanting
a
chat
why
i
delighted
she
exclaimed
frightened
but
all
the
more
ingratiating
oh
is
the
nile
beautiful
as
we
come
toward
nubia
and
are
the
sakkiyehs
more
interesting
than
the
shadoofs
which
they
use
mostly
when
the
river
is
low
willis
said
quite
a
lovely
thing
about
the
sakkiyehs
that
their
chains
of
great
water
cups
going
up
and
down
look
like
enormous
strings
of
red
and
green
being
by
unseen
hands
he
ought
to
be
a
poet
he
so
romantic
no
doubt
everything
about
you
miss
guest
must
make
an
appeal
to
his
romantic
side
i
cut
in
while
she
was
forced
to
pause
for
breath
i
hope
i
do
appeal
to
him
she
said
meekly
i
never
thought
to
be
so
happy
this
was
a
direct
appeal
to
and
it
hit
the
mark
i
did
care
a
rap
about
willis
bailey
or
his
sketches
or
the
wooden
statues
with
crystal
eyes
which
he
was
going
to
make
the
fashion
if
miss
guest
chose
to
hook
her
shining
fish
with
a
false
fly
it
was
my
business
it
was
hers
and
his
and
perhaps
monny
for
monny
had
backed
rachel
up
in
creating
a
wrong
impression
as
if
they
two
had
been
playing
together
like
children
to
trick
the
but
i
had
to
find
out
what
had
started
the
ball
rolling
because
it
looked
as
if
that
ball
had
come
out
of
the
pocket
of
bedr
i
glad
you
happy
i
said
and
my
hope
is
that
you
remain
so
i
wish
you
so
well
that
perhaps
you
give
me
the
right
to
ask
a
few
questions
you
see
i
one
of
your
oldest
friends
in
egypt
after
miss
gilder
and
her
aunt
and
jones
you
met
miss
gilder
and
east
travelling
in
france
they
told
me
yes
in
a
we
were
put
at
the
same
table
and
got
talking
i
just
loved
monny
at
first
sight
and
she
been
heavenly
to
me
what
fun
we
had
i
never
had
fun
before
i
hardly
knew
the
meaning
of
the
word
i
suppose
it
must
have
amused
you
and
miss
gilder
i
planted
my
arrow
at
last
though
not
remorselessly
this
quaint
idea
that
got
round
about
your
having
changed
places
rachel
face
crimsoned
oh
lord
ernest
she
sighed
in
an
explosive
whisper
with
a
glance
round
to
see
if
any
one
were
near
but
we
were
alone
with
the
beginnings
of
a
sunset
that
flushed
the
dun
hills
as
unripe
peaches
are
flushed
on
a
garden
wall
i
promised
monny
not
to
say
a
word
and
spoil
her
fun
as
long
as
the
trip
lasts
finding
out
you
see
which
people
are
really
attracted
to
her
for
herself
she
says
it
a
wonderful
experience
and
it
given
her
such
a
rest
from
men
the
silly
ones
you
know
it
is
fault
tell
in
a
if
she
let
me
was
it
she
who
began
the
game
i
dared
to
inquire
or
was
it
bedr
now
this
is
a
question
i
really
a
right
to
ask
i
tell
you
why
afterward
if
you
do
know
already
from
monny
no
i
do
think
monny
said
anything
to
make
me
understand
that
rachel
answered
stammering
a
little
and
trying
pathetically
not
to
look
anxious
but
i
answer
you
of
course
there
nothing
to
hide
from
now
that
i
can
see
it
bedr
who
began
he
was
the
most
intelligent
extraordinary
person
i
do
believe
any
one
fully
realized
it
except
me
but
from
that
first
night
at
alexandria
he
seemed
to
feel
that
i
saw
something
of
value
behind
his
poor
face
he
was
sensitive
and
he
attached
himself
to
me
in
the
most
beautiful
faithful
way
really
and
truly
if
there
had
come
that
trouble
about
the
hasheesh
place
which
his
fault
because
monny
wanted
to
go
and
when
she
wants
things
she
wants
them
very
much
i
believe
i
could
have
made
a
christian
of
him
he
would
have
been
a
wonderful
convert
we
talked
more
about
religion
than
anything
else
but
he
used
to
like
to
chat
about
america
because
he
been
there
and
hoped
to
go
again
was
the
way
the
joke
about
monny
and
me
started
he
ask
me
not
to
speak
of
it
but
it
ca
matter
now
he
told
me
when
he
was
in
new
york
with
a
family
who
took
him
from
egypt
one
day
the
great
gilder
daughter
was
pointed
out
to
him
in
the
street
she
was
with
her
father
in
an
automobile
but
there
was
a
block
in
the
traffic
a
policeman
was
keeping
it
back
so
he
saw
her
distinctly
for
several
minutes
and
he
was
interested
because
his
employers
told
him
how
important
the
gilders
were
and
how
gilder
used
to
have
his
daughter
guarded
every
minute
for
fear
she
might
be
kidnapped
for
ransom
as
several
rich
people
children
had
been
monny
could
have
been
more
than
fourteen
then
as
it
seven
years
ago
and
bedr
said
that
the
little
girl
he
saw
in
the
automobile
was
exactly
like
hardly
at
all
like
what
monny
is
now
he
wanted
me
to
tell
him
for
a
reason
which
he
vowed
and
swore
was
important
whether
i
was
really
miss
gilder
and
miss
guest
well
well
i
thought
the
idea
so
funny
so
thoroughly
you
know
and
like
something
in
a
book
that
just
for
fun
i
answered
that
i
could
tell
him
anything
until
i
consulted
my
friend
monny
nearly
went
wild
about
it
she
said
she
come
to
egypt
to
have
adventures
and
she
was
going
to
them
no
matter
whether
kept
or
not
that
just
a
little
slang
expression
people
use
at
home
sometimes
i
daresay
you
heard
her
say
much
the
same
thing
she
said
this
idea
of
bedr
was
too
good
to
miss
and
we
get
bushels
of
fun
out
of
it
so
we
have
in
different
ways
and
she
been
lovely
about
giving
me
dresses
and
things
when
she
and
i
talked
the
matter
over
she
understood
why
bedr
should
have
thought
she
was
more
like
me
at
the
age
of
fourteen
than
like
her
present
self
she
had
typhoid
fever
just
before
the
time
she
must
have
been
pointed
out
to
him
and
it
had
left
her
thin
as
a
rail
and
as
pale
as
a
ghost
her
hair
was
short
too
and
some
of
the
colour
had
been
burnt
out
of
it
by
the
fever
now
you
know
she
has
a
brilliant
complexion
and
her
face
is
much
rounder
than
mine
as
well
as
more
pink
and
white
compared
to
her
i
am
i
afraid
and
lanky
and
when
she
and
i
stand
together
her
hair
looks
bright
gold
and
mine
light
brown
in
comparison
monny
would
let
me
tell
bedr
right
out
that
he
was
mistaken
about
us
she
said
we
would
fib
but
we
act
as
if
we
had
a
secret
and
he
stumbled
on
it
he
must
have
started
the
story
oh
if
you
could
call
it
a
story
i
do
believe
anything
has
ever
been
put
into
words
it
was
in
the
air
people
got
the
idea
but
bedr
must
have
put
it
into
their
heads
neither
monny
nor
i
did
more
than
smile
and
look
away
and
change
the
subject
if
any
one
hinted
we
said
must
breathe
such
things
to
east
or
jones
or
they
be
angry
apparently
nobody
ever
did
dare
to
breathe
it
to
them
and
i
think
monny
mentioned
you
too
lord
ernest
she
did
want
you
to
know
she
was
afraid
you
say
that
the
whole
thing
was
nonsense
i
suppose
it
was
enid
biddell
who
came
to
you
she
was
afraid
snell
but
it
is
worth
talking
about
now
only
she
is
a
cat
miss
biddell
had
said
exactly
the
same
of
miss
guest
naturally
however
i
did
not
mention
the
coincidence
now
i
told
you
everything
you
wanted
to
know
have
i
rachel
went
on
or
were
there
any
more
questions
you
like
to
ask
i
mean
about
bedr
only
one
more
i
think
did
it
ever
strike
you
that
he
was
curious
about
you
or
rather
about
miss
gilder
who
you
both
let
him
suppose
was
really
miss
guest
anything
about
your
name
why
yes
he
was
curious
they
say
arabs
always
are
if
you
let
them
be
not
that
he
is
exactly
an
arab
but
i
suppose
armenians
are
the
same
he
seemed
to
want
to
know
things
about
me
what
i
done
where
i
lived
and
oh
lots
of
little
questions
he
would
ask
monny
and
i
made
up
our
minds
from
the
first
as
i
told
you
that
there
must
be
any
fibs
i
simply
put
him
off
he
never
got
anything
out
of
me
at
all
i
see
i
said
and
let
myself
drift
away
from
her
into
thoughtfulness
is
that
all
then
yes
that
is
all
thank
you
her
tone
sounded
as
if
she
were
relieved
of
a
mental
weight
and
would
like
to
go
i
expected
her
to
make
some
excuse
it
would
soon
be
time
to
dress
for
dinner
or
she
had
a
letter
to
write
but
no
she
lingered
she
was
trying
to
bring
herself
to
say
something
i
waited
in
silence
my
eyes
on
the
shining
river
looking
back
at
the
golden
trail
of
the
sun
that
was
like
a
rich
mantle
draping
a
gondola
on
a
fête
day
in
venice
i
suppose
you
think
she
forced
the
words
out
at
last
that
willis
bailey
would
have
fallen
in
love
or
proposed
if
he
had
thought
like
the
rest
that
i
i
i
do
see
why
he
should
miss
guest
he
really
does
seem
to
care
for
me
as
i
you
know
and
never
told
him
a
single
untruth
i
to
blame
myself
for
i
sure
of
that
yet
you
do
approve
of
me
one
bit
you
think
i
a
kind
of
adventuress
so
does
jones
why
what
would
the
people
at
home
in
salem
say
if
any
one
suggested
such
a
thing
you
do
know
the
life
i
led
lord
ernest
i
can
imagine
you
do
want
to
go
back
to
it
again
do
you
it
does
seem
as
if
i
now
it
seemed
so
even
before
willis
oh
i
sure
you
think
i
meant
to
go
back
once
broken
free
from
the
dull
grind
no
harm
in
that
i
glad
you
say
so
i
took
all
my
legacy
to
see
the
world
a
little
well
nearly
all
not
quite
perhaps
to
tell
the
truth
and
being
brave
has
brought
me
this
reward
the
love
of
a
man
who
can
give
me
everything
worth
having
i
sha
be
life
any
more
and
willis
wo
have
any
reason
to
blame
me
when
he
when
he
no
reason
of
course
i
fitted
into
her
long
pause
but
men
as
well
as
women
are
unreasonable
sometimes
you
know
and
if
he
should
be
so
er
as
to
think
you
deceived
him
about
yourself
then
he
ought
to
blame
monny
not
me
he
ought
perhaps
but
the
question
is
what
he
will
do
and
you
like
having
a
sword
hanging
over
your
head
supposing
he
should
be
unjust
and
refuse
to
carry
out
oh
lord
ernest
you
do
think
he
will
after
he
sworn
that
the
only
woman
in
the
world
he
could
ever
have
loved
he
thinks
me
better
looking
than
monny
he
says
she
has
got
a
yet
he
doubts
if
she
ever
will
have
one
i
did
doubt
it
i
thought
i
had
heard
it
stirring
in
the
throes
of
birth
a
soul
such
as
would
blind
the
eyes
of
a
rachel
guest
with
its
white
shining
monny
had
said
that
she
would
find
her
soul
in
egypt
but
the
mention
of
this
was
not
indicated
just
then
i
have
the
courage
to
tell
him
even
if
there
were
really
anything
definite
enough
to
tell
rachel
went
on
it
would
be
insulting
a
man
like
willis
to
suggest
that
he
been
influenced
you
know
what
i
mean
but
now
we
talking
of
it
oh
do
advise
me
we
planning
to
be
married
in
egypt
at
the
end
of
this
trip
and
then
settle
down
in
cairo
for
bailey
studies
at
the
museum
he
came
up
the
nile
only
for
me
you
see
and
he
says
i
shall
be
his
first
model
for
the
new
style
my
eyes
are
right
as
if
they
been
made
on
purpose
to
help
him
i
lie
awake
nights
wondering
what
if
before
the
wedding
when
he
finds
out
for
certain
that
my
name
is
really
only
rachel
guest
and
that
i
i
oh
i
dare
of
it
then
if
you
want
me
to
advise
why
do
you
in
some
tactful
perhaps
joking
way
speak
of
the
story
bedr
started
and
i
ca
i
simply
ca
yet
you
feel
it
would
be
better
yes
sometimes
i
feel
it
help
me
lord
ernest
tell
him
and
then
if
you
see
any
signs
you
make
him
understand
how
dreadful
it
would
be
to
throw
me
over
because
i
poor
and
have
been
a
nobody
till
now
i
do
my
best
i
heard
myself
weakly
promising
no
wonder
i
have
earned
the
nickname
of
duffer
chapter
xxv
marooned
had
any
human
fly
ever
buzzed
himself
so
fatally
into
the
of
other
people
love
affairs
i
asked
myself
sternly
as
soon
as
providence
plucked
me
out
of
one
web
back
i
would
bumble
into
another
though
i
had
no
time
for
a
love
affair
of
my
own
when
the
had
slipped
past
many
miles
of
desert
shore
and
tawny
as
a
leopard
skin
and
other
desert
shores
so
fiercely
yellow
as
to
create
an
effect
of
sunshine
under
gray
skies
we
arrived
at
assuan
i
had
not
yet
kept
my
promise
to
rachel
though
whether
from
lack
of
opportunity
or
courage
i
was
not
sure
here
we
were
at
historic
assuan
and
nothing
had
happened
nothing
which
could
be
written
down
in
black
and
white
since
the
excitements
at
luxor
nevertheless
some
of
us
were
different
within
and
the
differences
were
due
directly
or
indirectly
to
those
excitements
now
we
were
nearing
ethiopia
alias
the
land
of
cush
though
monny
said
she
could
not
bear
to
have
it
called
by
that
name
except
of
course
in
the
bible
where
it
could
be
helped
how
would
any
of
us
like
to
register
at
an
hotel
as
or
miss
of
cush
oshkosh
sounded
more
romantic
no
land
however
could
look
more
romantic
than
assuan
city
of
the
cataracts
greek
syene
that
granite
quarry
whose
red
syenite
made
obelisks
and
sarcophagi
for
kings
of
countless
dynasties
suan
as
the
copts
renamed
it
a
frontier
town
of
egypt
since
the
days
of
ezekiel
the
prophet
now
appeared
a
gay
place
made
for
sky
and
river
were
dazzling
blue
and
the
sea
of
sand
was
a
sea
of
gold
the
dark
rocks
lying
like
tamed
monsters
at
the
feet
of
khnum
god
of
the
cataract
glittered
bright
as
jet
over
which
a
libation
of
red
wine
had
gushed
the
of
the
town
with
its
hotels
and
shops
was
brightly
coloured
as
a
row
of
shining
shells
from
a
southern
sea
tints
of
pink
and
blue
and
amber
translucently
clear
in
contrast
with
the
dark
green
of
lebbek
trees
and
palms
in
whose
shadow
flowers
burned
like
flames
of
driftwood
between
our
eyes
and
the
brilliant
picture
a
network
of
thin
dark
lines
was
tangled
as
if
an
artist
had
defaced
his
canvas
with
scratches
of
a
drying
brush
these
scratches
were
in
reality
the
masts
of
moored
feluccas
bristling
close
to
the
shore
like
a
high
hedge
of
flower
stems
stripped
of
blossoms
and
bent
by
driving
wind
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
the
desert
crouched
like
a
lion
who
flings
back
his
head
with
a
shake
of
yellow
mane
before
he
stoops
to
drink
and
in
the
midst
of
the
stream
rose
elephantine
island
with
its
crown
of
feathery
palms
its
breastwork
of
roman
ruins
a
medal
of
fame
for
the
kings
it
gave
to
egypt
and
its
undying
lullaby
sung
by
the
cataract
among
surrounding
rocks
very
strange
rocks
they
were
black
as
wet
onyx
though
for
thousands
of
years
they
had
been
painted
rose
by
sunrise
and
sunset
shapes
of
animal
gods
shapes
of
negro
slaves
shapes
of
broken
obelisks
and
fallen
temples
shapes
of
elephants
like
those
seen
first
by
egyptians
on
this
island
shapes
which
one
felt
could
never
have
taken
form
except
in
egypt
over
our
heads
armies
of
migrating
birds
made
a
network
like
a
great
floating
scarf
of
beads
each
bead
a
bird
and
the
blue
water
round
the
was
crowded
with
boats
of
so
many
hitherto
unknown
sorts
that
they
might
have
been
visiting
craft
from
another
world
feluccas
with
sails
red
or
white
or
painted
in
strange
patterns
or
awninged
some
with
rails
like
open
trellis
work
of
many
colours
over
which
dark
faces
shone
like
copper
in
the
sunshine
rowing
boats
galleys
with
fluttering
flags
and
old
roughly
lined
with
tin
in
which
naked
imps
of
boys
perilously
paddled
out
from
the
boats
rushed
music
in
clouds
like
incense
wild
african
music
of
chanting
voices
beating
or
clapping
hands
that
clacked
together
like
castanets
very
old
men
and
very
young
youths
thumped
furiously
on
earthen
drums
shaped
like
the
jars
of
elephantine
once
so
famous
that
they
travelled
the
length
of
egypt
filled
with
wine
the
breeze
that
fanned
to
us
from
beyond
the
palms
and
lebbeks
the
roses
and
azaleas
was
soft
and
there
was
a
scent
in
it
too
as
of
ripe
grapes
as
if
a
fragrance
lingered
from
vanished
days
when
wine
for
the
gods
was
made
from
elephantine
vineyards
and
never
lost
their
leaves
we
ourselves
and
our
big
boat
were
alone
in
our
modernity
if
one
forgot
the
line
of
gay
buildings
on
the
shore
everything
else
might
have
been
of
the
time
when
the
world
supposed
elephantine
to
be
placed
directly
on
the
tropic
of
cancer
and
believed
in
the
magic
lamp
which
lit
the
unfathomable
well
the
time
when
quarries
of
red
and
yellow
clay
gave
riches
to
the
island
and
all
egypt
thanked
its
gods
when
elephantine
nilemeter
showed
that
the
two
lands
would
be
plentifully
watered
most
of
us
were
going
to
live
on
board
the
for
our
three
days
at
assuan
but
hearing
that
lords
and
ladies
of
high
degrees
swarmed
at
the
cataract
hotel
with
its
wild
watery
view
of
tumbled
rocks
and
at
the
savoy
in
its
flowery
gardens
some
went
where
they
might
hope
to
cross
the
path
of
dukes
and
duchesses
the
were
not
wild
about
the
aristocracy
nor
would
royalty
of
later
date
than
the
ptolemies
have
lured
cleopatra
from
her
suite
on
the
boat
but
the
whole
party
was
eager
for
shore
and
no
sooner
had
the
put
her
foot
on
the
yellow
sands
than
she
was
deserted
by
her
passengers
the
bazaars
were
the
first
attractions
for
everybody
said
that
they
were
as
fine
in
their
way
as
the
bazaars
of
cairo
so
very
soon
we
were
all
buying
silver
ivory
stuffed
crocodiles
and
ostrich
feathers
from
the
sudan
which
now
opened
its
gates
not
far
ahead
the
sudan
mysterious
unknown
and
vast
cleopatra
clung
to
me
with
a
certain
wistfulness
as
if
in
this
incarnation
she
were
not
so
intimately
at
home
in
upper
egypt
as
she
had
hoped
to
be
perhaps
this
loneliness
of
her
soul
was
due
to
the
fact
that
instead
of
seeking
her
society
anthony
with
an
h
seldom
came
near
her
now
something
had
warned
him
off
he
would
never
tell
me
or
any
one
on
earth
but
unused
to
the
ways
of
women
as
he
was
i
felt
sure
that
he
had
been
uncomfortably
enlightened
as
to
feelings
the
cure
according
to
his
prescription
was
evidently
to
be
absent
treatment
but
there
was
another
which
i
fancied
might
be
efficacious
the
sudden
arrival
on
the
scene
of
marcus
antonius
lark
i
happened
to
know
that
he
proposed
a
dash
from
cairo
to
assuan
by
train
for
i
had
received
two
telegrams
at
the
moment
of
walking
off
the
boat
the
first
message
announced
his
almost
immediate
advent
the
second
regretted
unavoidable
delay
but
expressed
an
intention
not
to
let
us
steam
away
for
wady
halfa
without
seeing
him
the
excuse
alleged
was
business
but
i
thought
i
saw
through
it
and
sympathized
for
he
whom
i
had
once
cursed
as
a
brutal
tyrant
of
now
loomed
large
as
a
pathetic
figure
despite
the
lesson
of
the
lotuses
i
believed
that
his
motive
was
to
try
his
chance
with
east
that
life
had
become
intolerable
unless
lark
luck
might
hold
again
and
that
he
could
not
wait
till
the
cruel
lady
returned
to
cairo
it
was
a
as
we
walked
side
by
side
to
the
bazaar
whether
i
told
her
the
news
or
left
her
to
be
surprised
by
the
unexpected
visitor
eventually
i
decided
that
silence
would
help
the
cause
and
in
thus
making
up
my
mind
i
was
far
from
guessing
that
my
own
fate
and
monny
and
anthony
and
brigit
hung
also
on
that
insignificant
decision
i
was
thankful
that
east
said
no
more
of
bringing
her
niece
and
me
together
and
that
on
the
contrary
she
dropped
dark
hints
about
everything
in
life
which
she
had
wanted
being
now
too
late
and
useless
to
hope
for
in
this
incarnation
why
she
had
changed
her
plans
for
monny
i
could
not
be
sure
enough
for
me
that
she
apparently
had
changed
them
sir
marcus
did
not
appear
the
next
day
or
the
next
and
i
heard
no
more
indeed
between
dread
of
breaking
the
truth
to
bill
bailey
and
at
letting
time
pass
without
breaking
it
i
almost
forgot
lark
love
affair
i
salved
my
conscience
by
working
unnecessarily
hard
and
even
helping
kruger
with
his
accounts
when
anthony
too
generously
relieved
me
of
other
duties
how
i
envied
fenton
at
this
time
because
no
girls
asked
him
what
men
they
ought
to
marry
or
implored
him
to
prevent
men
from
jilting
them
or
urged
him
to
enlighten
handsome
sculptors
with
wavy
soft
hair
and
hard
eyes
resembling
the
crystal
orbs
which
were
to
become
fashionable
in
society
anthony
loved
assuan
and
apparently
enjoyed
displaying
its
beauties
not
knowing
that
i
hid
a
fox
under
my
mantle
he
meant
to
be
kind
in
taking
people
off
my
hands
giving
them
tea
on
the
cataract
hotel
veranda
escorting
them
to
the
ruined
saracen
castle
which
with
elephantine
opposite
barred
the
river
and
made
a
noble
gateway
leading
them
at
sunset
to
the
arab
cemetery
in
the
desert
and
to
the
bisharin
village
where
wild
dark
creatures
whose
hair
was
pinned
with
arrows
and
whose
ancestors
were
mentioned
in
the
bible
sold
baskets
and
bracelets
and
what
not
there
were
really
as
sir
john
biddell
remarked
a
plethora
of
sights
not
counting
the
magnificent
rock
tombs
since
the
set
had
definitely
struck
against
tombs
of
all
descriptions
but
even
with
an
excursion
to
the
ancient
quarries
for
a
look
at
obelisks
for
once
i
had
not
enough
to
do
and
fenton
had
snatched
biddy
from
me
as
well
as
monny
mercilessly
he
had
them
sightseeing
every
moment
and
i
could
no
longer
scold
rachel
for
letting
things
slide
to
blame
her
would
be
for
the
pot
to
call
the
kettle
black
it
was
on
the
day
of
the
great
dam
that
i
screwed
my
courage
to
the
and
made
bailey
understand
that
his
fiancée
was
nobody
but
rachel
guest
that
she
would
be
rachel
guest
all
her
life
until
she
became
mrs
some
preferably
willis
bailey
somehow
it
seemed
appropriate
to
do
the
deed
at
the
dam
and
always
in
future
when
people
ask
what
impression
the
eighth
wonder
of
the
world
made
upon
me
i
shall
doubt
for
an
instant
whether
they
refer
to
the
american
sculptor
or
to
the
barrage
the
way
in
which
we
went
was
so
impressive
that
it
was
comparatively
easy
to
be
keyed
up
to
anything
most
travellers
make
the
trip
on
donkey
back
or
else
as
far
as
shellal
in
a
white
desert
train
where
violet
soothes
their
eyes
and
prepares
their
minds
for
a
future
journey
to
khartum
after
shellal
they
go
on
in
small
boats
to
the
wide
still
lake
which
the
great
dam
has
stored
up
for
the
supply
of
egypt
but
we
of
the
were
our
boat
being
of
less
bulk
than
her
new
rivals
she
was
able
to
reach
the
barrage
by
passing
up
through
its
many
locks
and
proceed
calmly
along
the
upper
nile
between
the
golden
shores
of
nubia
to
wady
haifa
we
remained
on
board
for
the
experience
and
though
i
had
the
task
of
telling
bailey
still
before
me
i
would
not
have
changed
places
with
a
king
as
standing
on
deck
with
biddy
by
my
side
i
felt
myself
ascending
the
once
impassable
cataracts
of
the
god
khnum
if
biddy
had
been
the
only
person
by
my
side
i
should
have
risked
telling
her
the
secret
she
ought
always
to
have
known
but
there
were
as
many
others
as
could
crowd
along
the
rail
for
once
they
were
reflective
not
inclined
to
chatter
perhaps
the
same
thought
took
different
forms
according
as
it
fitted
itself
into
different
heads
the
thought
of
that
marvellous
campaign
of
the
boats
which
fought
their
way
past
these
cataracts
to
relieve
gordon
the
ascent
was
a
pageant
for
us
for
them
it
had
meant
strife
and
disaster
and
death
we
admired
the
glimpses
of
yellow
desert
we
exclaimed
joyously
at
the
mad
turmoil
of
green
water
the
and
rocks
below
the
dam
for
us
it
was
a
scene
of
unforgettable
majesty
for
those
others
the
waste
of
river
must
have
yawned
like
a
wicked
mouth
full
of
water
and
jagged
black
teeth
which
opened
to
gulp
down
boats
and
men
it
was
on
the
brink
of
the
barrage
itself
that
i
spoke
to
bailey
and
there
looking
down
over
the
immense
granite
parapet
upon
line
after
line
of
tamed
cataracts
breathing
rainbows
we
were
so
small
so
insignificant
that
surely
it
could
not
matter
to
a
man
whether
the
girl
of
his
heart
were
an
heiress
or
a
beggar
maid
there
was
room
in
the
world
only
for
the
mighty
of
these
waters
and
the
ever
underlying
song
of
love
i
saw
by
the
look
in
bailey
eyes
however
as
he
gazed
away
from
me
to
the
dragon
form
of
a
huge
derrick
that
it
matter
i
had
been
tactful
i
had
mentioned
the
mistake
in
identity
as
if
it
were
a
silly
game
played
by
children
a
game
which
neither
he
nor
i
nor
any
one
could
ever
have
regarded
seriously
he
controlled
himself
and
took
it
well
so
far
as
outward
appearance
went
but
soon
he
made
an
excuse
to
escape
and
presently
i
saw
him
strolling
off
alone
head
down
hands
in
pockets
luncheon
was
being
prepared
on
the
veranda
of
a
house
belonging
to
the
chief
engineer
of
the
dam
its
owner
was
a
friend
of
sir
marcus
lark
and
being
away
had
agreed
to
lend
his
place
to
our
party
kruger
having
done
no
end
of
writing
and
telegraphing
to
secure
it
many
of
our
people
had
got
off
the
in
one
of
the
locks
and
had
walked
up
the
steps
to
the
of
the
barrage
brigit
and
i
among
others
and
as
we
assembled
for
lunch
it
was
an
odd
sight
to
see
our
white
floating
home
rising
higher
and
higher
until
at
last
she
rode
out
on
the
surface
of
the
broad
sea
of
nile
which
is
held
up
by
the
granite
wall
of
the
barrage
she
was
to
be
moored
by
the
dam
and
to
wait
for
us
there
until
evening
when
we
should
have
exhausted
the
barrage
and
ourselves
and
have
visited
philae
by
and
by
luncheon
was
ready
served
by
our
waiters
from
the
but
bailey
did
not
return
rachel
begged
that
our
table
might
wait
for
a
few
minutes
perhaps
he
had
gone
the
length
of
the
dam
in
one
of
those
handcars
on
which
some
of
our
people
had
dashed
up
and
down
the
famous
granite
mile
their
little
vehicles
pushed
by
arabs
he
might
be
back
in
a
few
minutes
but
the
minutes
passed
and
he
did
not
come
the
stretched
its
neck
from
far
away
as
if
to
peer
curiously
at
rachel
the
black
and
red
and
purple
monsters
disguised
as
rocks
for
this
wild
masquerade
ball
of
the
nile
foamed
at
the
mouth
with
watery
mirth
at
the
trouble
these
silly
things
called
girls
had
always
been
bringing
on
themselves
since
earth
and
egypt
were
young
together
the
look
of
the
forsaken
the
jilted
was
already
stamped
upon
rachel
face
she
tried
to
eat
when
the
picnic
meal
could
be
put
off
no
longer
but
could
scarcely
swallow
monny
glanced
at
her
anxiously
from
time
to
time
perhaps
suspecting
something
of
the
truth
and
the
eyes
of
both
girls
turned
to
me
now
and
then
with
an
appeal
which
made
unpalatable
my
eggs
and
drumsticks
bother
the
whole
blamed
business
thought
i
had
i
done
all
i
could
was
i
practically
running
the
lives
of
these
tiresome
tourists
as
well
as
their
tour
what
did
that
adventuress
out
of
a
new
england
schoolroom
want
of
me
now
when
washed
my
hands
of
her
and
her
affairs
but
all
through
there
was
no
real
use
in
asking
myself
these
questions
i
knew
what
rachel
wanted
and
that
i
should
have
to
do
it
if
only
to
please
biddy
who
would
be
if
indiscretions
should
wreck
the
happiness
of
even
the
most
undeserving
young
female
darling
monny
must
be
saved
from
remorse
at
all
costs
one
of
the
costs
to
me
was
luncheon
as
well
as
peace
of
mind
i
excused
myself
from
the
table
i
pretended
to
have
forgotten
some
business
of
importance
i
whispered
to
the
steward
who
had
come
to
look
after
the
waiters
that
the
meal
must
be
served
as
slowly
as
possible
drag
out
the
courses
said
i
make
eat
salad
by
itself
and
everything
separate
except
bread
and
butter
having
given
these
last
instructions
i
was
off
like
an
arrow
shot
from
the
bow
a
reluctant
arrow
sulking
at
its
own
impetus
instinct
was
the
hand
that
aimed
me
the
was
the
target
and
deck
cabin
no
was
the
as
i
expected
bailey
was
in
his
stateroom
i
had
not
far
to
go
only
to
hurry
from
the
house
along
the
riverbank
to
the
landing
place
where
a
number
of
native
boats
were
lying
jump
into
one
and
row
out
a
few
yards
but
the
heat
of
noon
after
the
cool
shade
of
the
veranda
was
terrific
i
arrived
out
of
breath
my
brow
richly
embroidered
with
crystal
beads
just
in
time
to
find
bailey
squeezing
his
bath
sponge
preparatory
to
packing
it
in
a
yawning
kitbag
already
full
at
such
a
moment
he
could
squeeze
a
sponge
i
hated
him
for
this
as
though
the
sponge
had
been
rachel
heart
on
his
berth
lay
a
letter
addressed
to
her
and
another
to
me
no
doubt
he
told
us
both
that
he
had
received
an
urgent
telegram
he
was
so
taken
aback
at
sight
of
the
task
master
that
he
let
me
withdraw
the
sponge
from
his
pulseless
fingers
i
laid
it
reverently
on
the
as
a
heart
should
be
laid
on
an
altar
my
dear
fellow
i
began
yes
to
my
credit
be
it
spoken
i
said
dear
fellow
you
do
know
what
you
are
doing
i
speak
for
your
own
sake
think
what
people
will
say
everyone
will
see
why
you
left
her
and
you
do
to
leave
her
you
know
of
course
you
do
you
love
miss
guest
she
loves
you
not
all
the
crystal
eyes
in
the
world
can
make
you
the
fashion
if
the
eyes
of
your
fiancée
are
red
with
tears
because
you
jilted
her
when
you
found
out
she
was
only
herself
people
do
like
such
things
they
wo
have
their
artists
cold
and
calculating
it
is
done
you
ca
afford
to
squeeze
a
sp
i
mean
break
a
heart
in
this
fashion
it
will
ruin
your
reputation
so
i
argued
with
a
certain
eloquence
forcing
conviction
until
with
a
fierce
gesture
bailey
snatched
six
collars
from
his
bag
and
flung
them
on
the
bed
seeing
thus
clearly
what
i
thought
showed
him
what
others
were
sure
to
think
and
the
world
opinion
was
life
itself
to
bailey
he
was
cowed
then
conquered
at
last
i
dared
to
say
may
i
he
nodded
instantly
i
tore
the
letters
into
as
many
pieces
as
there
were
collars
afterward
when
we
walked
off
the
boat
arm
in
arm
i
dropped
them
into
the
water
we
got
back
to
the
engineer
before
the
picnickers
had
finished
their
belated
turkish
coffee
bailey
took
the
vacant
chair
between
rachel
guest
and
monny
gilder
biddy
said
that
she
had
asked
to
have
some
coffee
kept
hot
for
me
i
needed
it
that
is
what
delayed
our
start
for
philae
and
is
i
suppose
why
everything
that
took
place
there
afterward
happened
exactly
as
it
did
if
we
had
left
the
dam
an
hour
earlier
there
would
have
been
no
excuse
to
stop
for
sunset
at
the
temple
which
those
who
love
it
call
the
pearl
of
egypt
as
it
was
but
that
comes
afterward
when
strabo
went
from
syene
to
philae
he
drove
in
a
chariot
with
the
prefect
of
that
place
through
a
very
flat
plain
and
on
both
sides
of
their
road
i
fear
for
their
bones
it
was
a
rough
one
rose
blocks
of
dark
hard
rock
resembling
nearly
two
thousand
years
later
we
were
rowed
to
the
same
temple
across
an
immensely
deep
vast
sheet
of
shining
crystal
we
lolled
i
am
fond
of
that
word
though
aware
that
it
reserved
for
villainesses
in
galleys
painted
in
colours
so
violent
that
they
looked
like
tropical
birds
they
were
awninged
and
convulsively
propelled
by
nubians
whose
veins
swelled
in
their
full
black
throats
and
whose
ebony
faces
were
plastered
with
a
grayish
froth
of
sweat
each
pressed
a
great
toe
like
a
potato
on
the
seat
in
front
of
him
for
support
in
the
fierce
effort
of
rowing
turbans
were
torn
off
shaved
perspiring
heads
and
even
went
in
the
last
extreme
wild
appeals
were
chanted
to
all
the
handiest
saints
to
grant
aid
in
the
terrible
undertaking
an
child
at
the
steering
wheel
gazed
pityingly
at
his
agonized
elders
and
then
just
as
you
expected
the
whole
crew
to
fall
dead
from
heart
failure
they
chuckled
with
glee
at
some
joke
of
their
own
there
was
always
breath
and
energy
enough
to
spare
when
they
wanted
it
but
what
would
you
the
labourer
must
be
worthy
of
his
hire
and
a
little
something
over
when
strabo
saw
philae
she
was
a
distant
neighbour
of
the
mighty
cataracts
now
the
waters
which
once
rushed
down
are
prisoned
by
the
great
dam
and
stand
enslaved
to
wall
the
temple
round
like
a
great
pearl
in
a
crystal
case
she
is
the
true
bride
of
the
nile
for
as
long
ago
the
fairest
of
maidens
gave
herself
to
the
water
as
a
sacrifice
so
philae
gives
herself
for
the
life
of
the
people
she
drowns
but
in
death
she
is
more
beautiful
than
when
the
eyes
of
the
old
historian
beheld
her
glowing
with
the
colours
of
her
youth
yet
already
old
deserted
by
gods
and
priests
and
worshippers
now
she
has
worshippers
from
the
four
ends
of
the
earth
and
the
greatest
singers
of
the
world
chant
her
funeral
hymn
for
in
all
egypt
with
its
many
temples
of
supreme
magnificence
there
is
nothing
like
philae
none
can
forget
her
none
can
confuse
her
identity
for
a
moment
with
that
of
any
other
monument
of
a
dead
religion
and
if
she
were
the
only
temple
in
egypt
egypt
would
be
worth
crossing
the
ocean
to
see
because
of
this
dying
pearl
in
its
crystal
case
venus
rose
from
the
sea
philae
the
marriage
temple
of
osiris
and
isis
venus
of
egypt
sinks
into
the
sea
of
waters
poured
over
her
by
khnum
god
of
the
cataracts
thus
the
great
enchantress
sings
her
to
touch
the
heart
of
the
world
her
fair
head
afloat
like
a
sacred
lotus
on
the
gleaming
water
i
think
there
were
few
among
us
who
did
not
fancy
they
heard
that
song
as
our
nubian
men
rowed
across
the
sea
stored
up
by
the
great
barrage
from
far
away
we
saw
a
strange
apparition
as
of
a
temple
rising
from
the
waters
it
seemed
unreal
at
first
a
mere
mirage
of
a
temple
then
it
took
solid
outline
darkly
cut
in
silver
a
low
roof
a
pylon
towering
high
and
to
the
south
separated
from
both
these
a
thing
that
might
have
been
a
huge
wreath
of
purple
flowers
we
knew
however
from
too
many
photographs
and
postcards
that
this
was
pharaoh
bed
the
unfinished
temple
of
augustus
and
trajan
standing
on
a
flooded
island
our
boat
glided
close
to
the
stems
of
the
columns
supporting
the
low
roof
far
down
in
the
clear
depths
we
could
see
the
roots
of
the
pillars
or
their
phantom
reflections
and
in
the
light
of
afternoon
the
water
was
so
vivid
a
green
that
the
colour
of
it
seemed
to
have
washed
off
from
the
painted
stones
onto
this
roof
we
scrambled
up
a
flight
of
steps
and
found
that
we
were
not
to
have
philae
to
ourselves
there
were
other
boats
other
tourists
but
we
pretended
that
they
were
invisible
and
they
played
the
same
game
with
us
ignoring
one
another
the
rival
bands
wandered
about
wondered
what
the
place
would
be
like
with
the
water
down
quoted
poetry
and
and
climbed
the
pylon
from
that
height
the
kiosk
called
pharaoh
bed
showed
a
mirrored
double
like
an
old
ivory
casket
with
jewelled
sides
piled
full
of
a
queen
emeralds
we
loitered
we
explored
and
having
descended
sat
down
to
rest
dangling
irreverent
feet
over
beryl
depths
splashed
with
gold
thus
we
whiled
away
an
hour
perhaps
then
the
set
impressed
at
first
had
had
enough
of
the
mermaid
temple
tragic
beauty
sir
john
biddell
reminded
me
that
it
had
been
a
long
day
for
the
ladies
and
very
hot
had
we
better
get
back
to
the
before
sunset
but
that
was
exactly
what
some
of
us
did
not
want
to
do
the
matter
was
finally
settled
by
retaining
our
one
small
boat
with
two
rowers
and
sending
off
the
two
larger
galleys
with
their
full
complement
of
passengers
excepting
only
jones
miss
gilder
antoun
effendi
the
melancholy
cleopatra
and
the
guilty
shepherd
of
the
flock
who
knew
he
had
no
business
to
desert
his
sheep
he
did
nevertheless
feel
poor
brute
that
after
such
a
day
he
had
earned
a
little
pleasure
and
accordingly
proceeded
to
snatch
it
from
fate
despite
disapproving
glances
punishment
however
fell
as
soon
as
it
was
due
i
had
stayed
behind
with
the
intention
of
amusing
brigit
but
monny
took
her
from
me
as
if
she
had
bought
the
right
to
use
my
childhood
friend
whenever
it
suddenly
occurred
to
her
to
want
a
chaperon
instead
of
biddy
i
got
cleopatra
and
by
this
time
so
far
as
we
knew
all
tourists
save
ourselves
had
gone
i
knew
in
my
heart
that
in
accusing
monny
gilder
of
claiming
brigit
because
she
was
paying
her
expenses
i
did
the
girl
an
injustice
monny
was
afraid
of
herself
with
anthony
i
saw
that
plainly
since
the
fact
had
been
laid
under
my
nose
by
east
she
feared
the
glamour
of
this
magical
place
perhaps
and
felt
the
need
of
biddy
companionship
to
keep
her
strong
not
realizing
that
any
one
else
was
yearning
for
the
lady
this
was
the
whole
front
of
her
offending
yet
i
was
so
disappointed
that
i
wanted
to
be
brutal
without
biddy
i
should
wish
but
to
howl
at
the
sunset
as
a
dog
bays
the
moon
and
feeling
thus
i
may
not
have
made
myself
too
agreeable
to
cleopatra
in
any
case
after
we
had
sat
in
silence
for
a
while
waiting
for
a
sunset
not
yet
ready
to
arrive
she
turned
reproachful
eyes
upon
me
lord
ernest
she
said
i
think
you
had
better
go
and
join
monny
why
i
surlily
inquired
i
thought
thought
that
idea
of
yours
was
too
late
to
be
of
any
use
now
i
do
think
so
she
replied
interesting
is
too
late
now
still
you
better
go
are
you
tired
of
me
i
stupidly
catechised
her
well
i
feel
as
if
i
should
like
to
be
alone
in
this
wonderful
place
want
to
think
i
see
said
i
scrambling
up
from
my
seat
on
the
edge
of
the
temple
roof
and
trying
not
to
show
by
my
expression
that
i
was
pleased
or
that
both
my
feet
had
gone
to
sleep
in
that
case
i
leave
you
to
the
spooks
may
none
but
the
right
ones
come
thank
you
she
returned
dryly
and
i
limped
off
walking
on
air
tempered
with
pins
and
needles
joy
my
luck
had
turned
at
the
top
of
the
worn
stone
stairway
cut
in
the
pylon
i
met
biddy
she
was
dim
as
one
of
cleopatra
ptolemaic
ghosts
in
the
darkness
of
the
passage
but
to
me
that
darkness
was
brighter
than
the
best
thing
in
sunsets
salutation
to
caesar
from
one
about
to
die
i
ejaculated
what
you
mean
she
asked
i
mean
that
both
my
feet
are
fast
asleep
and
i
shall
certainly
fall
and
kill
myself
if
i
try
to
go
one
step
further
up
or
down
you
the
climber
of
impossible
cliffs
after
nests
she
laughed
but
she
stood
still
i
after
something
better
than
nests
now
said
i
the
question
is
whether
it
not
still
more
inaccessible
are
you
talking
about
monny
she
wanted
to
know
in
a
whisper
sit
down
and
i
tell
you
was
my
answer
oh
not
here
at
the
top
of
the
steps
if
it
anything
as
private
as
biddy
objected
all
excitement
in
an
instant
let
come
into
a
tiny
room
off
the
stairway
which
the
guardian
showed
me
a
few
minutes
ago
there
a
bench
in
it
you
see
he
up
there
on
the
pylon
roof
now
with
monny
and
captain
fenton
i
call
him
antoun
when
i
talk
to
you
its
silly
and
he
probably
be
coming
down
in
a
minute
then
if
we
stop
where
we
are
we
have
to
jump
up
and
get
out
of
the
way
to
let
him
pass
and
he
sure
to
linger
and
work
off
his
english
on
us
i
do
think
we
want
to
be
interrupted
that
way
do
you
no
nor
any
other
way
i
agreed
oh
but
what
about
the
sunset
we
may
miss
it
hang
the
sunset
let
it
slide
down
behind
the
dam
if
it
likes
i
do
wonder
you
feel
so
you
poor
dear
biddy
sympathized
when
it
a
question
of
monny
and
all
our
hopes
going
to
pieces
the
way
they
are
doing
every
minute
there
is
a
second
to
lose
so
we
went
into
the
little
room
in
the
tower
which
was
lit
only
by
a
small
square
opening
over
our
heads
we
sat
down
on
the
bench
it
was
beautifully
dark
i
began
to
talk
to
biddy
we
had
forgotten
my
feet
and
i
forgot
east
but
i
must
tell
what
was
happening
to
her
at
the
time
as
i
learned
afterward
through
the
confession
of
an
impenitent
before
i
begin
to
tell
what
happened
to
us
otherwise
the
situation
which
developed
ca
be
made
clear
i
left
cleopatra
calling
spirits
from
the
vasty
deep
or
rather
one
spirit
the
spirit
of
antony
i
am
morally
sure
that
any
other
would
have
been
and
sailing
to
her
across
the
wide
water
from
shellal
came
marcus
antonius
lark
i
ca
say
whether
she
considered
him
an
answer
to
her
prayer
or
a
denial
of
it
anyhow
there
he
was
better
perhaps
than
nobody
until
she
learned
from
his
own
lips
tactless
though
ardent
lips
that
he
had
come
from
cairo
to
assuan
from
assuan
to
philae
to
see
her
then
she
took
alarm
and
remarked
in
the
old
conventional
way
of
women
that
they
better
go
look
for
the
others
but
sir
marcus
had
spent
his
money
time
and
gray
matter
in
hurrying
to
philae
from
shellal
for
nothing
finding
himself
too
late
to
catch
us
at
assuan
he
had
paid
for
a
special
train
in
order
to
follow
his
enchantress
the
lady
and
the
boat
taking
a
felucca
with
a
fine
spread
of
canvas
and
many
rowers
which
characteristically
he
bargained
for
at
the
shellal
he
sailed
across
to
the
moored
steamer
only
to
learn
from
kruger
that
we
had
gone
on
our
expedition
to
philae
that
meant
a
long
sail
and
row
for
the
impatient
lover
for
us
the
longer
it
was
the
better
one
of
the
chief
charms
of
our
best
day
but
for
him
it
must
have
been
tedious
despite
a
good
breeze
that
filled
the
sails
and
helped
the
rowers
on
his
way
to
the
temple
he
met
the
galleys
going
home
to
the
an
instant
shock
of
disappointment
and
then
the
glad
relief
of
realizing
that
the
one
he
sought
was
still
at
the
place
where
he
wished
to
find
her
there
were
only
four
obstacles
which
might
prevent
an
ideal
meeting
the
names
of
these
obstacles
in
his
mind
were
jones
gilder
fenton
and
borrow
and
being
an
expert
in
abolishing
obstacles
the
great
sir
marcus
began
to
map
out
a
plan
of
action
luckily
for
him
our
small
boat
had
moved
out
of
cleopatra
sight
as
she
sat
and
dreamed
on
the
low
while
we
four
obstacles
disported
ourselves
on
different
parts
of
the
high
pylon
the
two
nubians
wished
to
play
a
betting
game
with
a
kind
of
egyptian
and
it
was
not
desirable
that
the
pensive
lady
should
behold
them
doing
it
observing
the
graceful
figure
of
east
silhouetted
against
the
sky
eternal
flame
of
blue
and
at
the
same
time
noticing
that
she
could
not
see
the
waiting
boat
sir
marcus
got
his
inspiration
he
knew
that
the
four
obstacles
were
somewhere
about
the
temple
now
was
his
great
chance
while
they
were
out
of
the
way
and
if
he
resolved
to
play
them
a
trick
perhaps
he
salved
his
conscience
by
telling
it
that
the
obstacles
male
and
female
ought
to
thank
him
cleopatra
probably
thought
if
she
glanced
up
to
see
his
boat
oh
dear
another
load
of
tourists
and
promptly
looked
down
to
avoid
the
horrid
vision
by
the
time
sir
marcus
came
within
how
do
you
do
distance
he
had
bribed
our
waiting
boatmen
to
row
away
this
in
order
not
to
be
caught
in
a
lie
with
our
nubians
and
their
craft
out
of
his
watery
way
he
was
free
to
fib
when
the
time
came
go
look
for
the
others
he
echoed
proposal
why
they
gone
i
met
them
gone
and
left
me
behind
when
they
knew
i
was
here
she
exclaimed
they
ca
have
done
such
a
thing
i
afraid
there
been
a
mistake
replied
sir
marcus
presently
they
certainly
gone
i
met
the
boat
borrow
was
expecting
me
you
know
or
maybe
you
do
know
and
when
he
saw
me
in
my
felucca
he
stopped
his
to
explain
that
evidently
there
been
a
i
sure
lark
mispronounced
that
word
the
temple
guardian
said
a
gentleman
had
arrived
and
taken
the
lady
who
was
waiting
off
in
a
boat
of
course
borrow
thought
i
had
come
along
and
persuaded
you
to
go
with
me
after
telling
the
guardian
to
let
him
know
i
expect
the
guardian
got
mighty
little
english
and
they
say
white
ladies
all
look
alike
to
blacks
he
must
have
mixed
you
up
with
some
other
lady
i
suppose
my
folks
have
been
the
only
people
at
philae
since
you
came
east
admitted
that
a
number
of
creatures
had
come
and
gone
but
she
thought
all
had
vanished
before
the
departure
of
the
galleys
you
see
you
thought
wrong
that
all
there
is
to
it
sir
marcus
assured
her
and
having
taken
these
elaborate
measures
to
secure
the
lady
society
for
himself
alone
nubian
rowers
do
count
he
proceeded
to
lure
her
hastily
into
his
own
boat
lest
any
or
all
of
the
obstacles
should
arrive
to
spoil
his
that
was
the
manner
of
our
marooning
at
the
time
we
were
ignorant
of
what
was
happening
behind
our
backs
the
sunset
for
instance
and
the
only
available
boat
calmly
rowing
away
from
the
drowned
temple
of
philae
we
were
thinking
of
something
else
and
so
was
sir
marcus
or
he
would
not
have
forgotten
the
repentant
promise
he
made
himself
soon
to
send
back
a
boat
and
take
us
off
we
were
therefore
in
the
position
of
unrehearsed
actors
in
a
play
who
do
know
what
awaits
them
in
the
next
act
while
those
who
may
read
this
can
see
the
whole
situation
from
above
below
and
on
both
sides
four
of
us
marooned
at
philae
not
knowing
it
and
night
coming
on
chapter
xxvi
what
we
said
what
we
heard
biddy
you
were
never
wiser
in
your
life
i
exploded
as
i
got
her
on
the
bench
you
warned
me
there
was
a
second
to
lose
i
lost
years
already
and
i
ca
stand
it
the
sixtieth
part
of
a
minute
longer
without
telling
you
how
i
love
you
my
goodness
gasped
biddy
do
be
serious
for
once
duffer
this
is
no
time
for
jokes
do
you
know
you
delayed
and
delayed
in
spite
of
my
advice
till
you
practically
lost
that
girl
and
if
any
chance
left
the
only
chance
i
want
is
with
you
i
said
darling
i
want
you
with
my
heart
and
soul
and
all
there
is
of
me
i
any
chance
and
how
long
since
were
you
taken
this
way
demanded
biddy
at
her
most
irish
staring
at
me
through
the
darkness
of
the
little
dim
room
in
the
pylon
ever
since
you
were
an
adorable
darling
of
four
years
i
assured
her
only
i
was
interrupted
by
going
to
eton
and
oxford
and
your
being
married
but
the
love
has
always
been
there
in
a
deep
undertone
the
music
never
stopped
once
it
never
could
and
when
i
saw
you
on
the
you
fell
in
love
with
monny
breathlessly
she
cut
me
short
nothing
of
the
kind
i
contradicted
her
fiercely
you
me
to
fall
in
love
with
miss
gilder
i
objected
politely
you
overruled
my
objections
or
tried
to
i
let
you
think
you
had
and
for
a
while
after
that
you
know
perfectly
well
biddy
the
set
gave
me
no
time
to
think
any
thoughts
connected
with
myself
you
poor
fellow
you
have
been
a
slave
the
angel
was
caught
in
the
trap
set
for
her
pity
and
a
martyr
a
martyr
i
deserve
a
reward
give
it
to
me
biddy
promise
here
in
this
beautiful
marriage
temple
to
marry
me
let
me
take
care
of
you
all
the
rest
of
your
life
my
patience
a
nice
reward
for
you
she
snapped
let
you
be
hoist
by
the
same
petard
that
always
lying
around
to
hoist
me
what
do
you
of
me
duffer
and
after
all
the
proofs
we
just
had
of
the
dangerous
creature
i
am
why
the
whole
trouble
at
luxor
was
on
my
account
even
you
must
see
that
monny
and
i
would
have
been
let
into
rechid
house
if
those
secret
men
had
persuaded
him
to
play
into
their
hands
and
revenge
himself
on
you
men
as
well
as
on
us
for
interfering
with
mabel
it
was
plot
not
rechid
we
escaped
from
and
it
was
theirs
at
the
temple
of
mût
too
rechid
was
only
their
thinking
he
played
his
own
hand
what
they
wanted
to
do
i
ca
tell
but
i
can
tell
from
what
one
of
them
said
to
monny
in
the
temple
that
they
took
her
for
richard
daughter
poor
child
her
love
for
me
and
all
her
affectionate
treatment
of
me
must
have
made
it
seem
likely
enough
to
them
that
she
was
esmé
safely
disguised
as
an
important
young
personage
to
travel
with
her
stepmother
bedr
must
have
assured
his
employers
that
he
was
certain
the
pale
girl
was
really
miss
gilder
so
they
thought
the
other
one
with
me
must
be
esmé
you
ca
laugh
at
my
fears
any
more
and
i
ask
you
again
what
you
think
of
me
to
believe
i
mix
you
up
in
my
future
scrapes
i
think
you
the
darling
of
the
world
said
i
and
my
one
talent
as
you
must
have
noticed
is
getting
people
out
of
scrapes
it
be
wasted
if
i
ca
have
you
besides
under
the
wing
of
an
embassy
no
one
will
dare
to
try
and
steal
you
or
blow
you
up
we
be
diplomats
together
biddy
come
you
say
i
all
my
life
to
get
what
i
wanted
certainly
i
done
a
lot
of
genuine
duffing
in
love
but
do
bear
out
your
own
expressed
opinion
of
the
work
by
saving
it
from
failure
could
you
try
and
like
me
a
little
if
only
for
that
you
were
always
so
unselfish
hush
said
biddy
suddenly
hush
do
you
hate
me
then
is
it
by
any
chance
anthony
you
love
no
no
hold
your
tongue
duffer
to
questions
i
sha
stop
till
you
answer
no
to
both
then
will
you
be
silent
not
unless
you
say
you
do
care
for
me
yes
yes
i
do
care
but
sh
do
you
hear
they
talking
just
outside
that
window
in
the
wall
if
you
ca
keep
a
still
tongue
in
your
head
then
for
all
the
saints
whisper
her
brogue
was
exquisite
and
so
was
she
i
worshipped
her
when
i
slipped
my
arm
round
her
waist
she
dared
not
cry
out
the
same
when
i
clasped
her
hand
things
were
coming
my
way
at
last
and
if
i
put
my
lips
close
against
her
ear
i
could
whisper
as
low
as
she
liked
i
liked
it
too
and
i
the
ear
she
was
right
they
were
indeed
talking
just
outside
the
window
monny
gilder
and
anthony
fenton
the
prologue
was
evidently
over
and
the
first
act
was
on
it
began
well
with
a
touch
of
human
interest
certain
to
please
an
audience
but
unfortunately
for
every
one
concerned
this
was
a
private
rehearsal
for
actors
only
not
a
public
performance
biddy
and
i
had
no
business
in
the
dark
auditorium
we
were
deadheads
we
had
sneaked
in
without
paying
the
situation
was
one
for
a
nightmare
for
heaven
sake
let
me
cough
or
knock
something
over
i
implored
biddy
ear
which
it
struck
me
at
the
moment
was
more
like
a
flower
than
an
unsympathetic
shell
best
similes
to
the
contrary
who
could
have
imagined
that
it
would
be
so
heavenly
a
sensation
to
have
your
nose
tickled
by
a
woman
hair
there
nothing
you
can
knock
over
but
me
biddy
retorted
as
fiercely
as
she
could
in
a
voice
no
louder
than
a
mosquito
and
if
you
cough
i
know
you
a
why
curiosity
forced
me
to
pursue
because
you
donkey
ye
say
ye
do
want
her
yourself
yet
ye
give
yer
best
friend
a
chance
ca
be
a
dog
and
a
donkey
at
the
same
time
i
murmured
choose
which
and
stick
to
it
if
ye
want
me
to
know
what
ye
mean
why
you
you
man
do
ye
see
if
we
interrupt
at
such
a
minute
and
such
a
conversation
they
can
begin
again
where
they
left
off
if
wanted
her
i
have
tried
to
save
her
for
ye
at
any
cost
but
as
ye
do
for
goodness
sake
give
the
two
their
chance
to
come
to
an
understanding
now
be
still
i
tell
ye
or
they
may
hear
us
we
ca
just
sit
and
eavesdrop
stop
yer
ears
then
it
take
both
hands
it
would
which
is
the
reason
i
did
do
it
that
would
have
been
asking
too
much
of
the
most
honourable
man
in
the
circumstances
meanwhile
the
two
outside
went
on
talking
believing
themselves
to
be
alone
with
the
sunset
there
was
no
reason
to
lower
their
voices
they
spoke
in
ordinary
tones
though
what
they
said
was
not
ordinary
and
we
on
the
other
side
of
the
little
unglazed
window
could
not
help
hearing
every
word
i
been
wanting
to
say
it
for
a
long
time
in
a
voice
like
that
of
a
penitent
child
monny
was
following
up
something
we
had
fortunately
lost
only
how
could
i
begin
it
i
do
see
even
now
how
i
did
begin
exactly
it
almost
easy
though
since
i
have
begun
i
was
horrid
horrid
i
ca
forgive
myself
yet
i
want
you
to
forgive
me
for
doing
your
whole
race
a
shameful
injustice
for
not
understanding
it
or
you
or
or
anything
you
shown
me
what
a
modern
egyptian
man
can
be
in
spite
of
things
i
read
and
heard
and
been
silly
enough
to
believe
oh
it
is
just
that
you
come
from
some
great
family
and
that
you
could
call
yourself
a
prince
if
you
liked
as
lord
ernest
says
told
me
how
you
could
have
a
fortune
and
a
great
place
in
your
country
if
you
reconcile
yourself
with
your
grandfather
in
constantinople
but
that
you
wo
because
it
would
mean
going
against
england
it
is
your
position
but
what
you
that
has
made
me
see
how
small
and
ridiculous
i
been
antoun
effendi
can
you
possibly
forgive
me
for
the
way
i
treated
you
at
first
now
i
confessed
and
told
you
very
very
sorry
and
ashamed
i
would
forgive
you
if
there
were
anything
to
forgive
anthony
answered
and
it
must
have
taken
pretty
well
all
his
immense
to
go
on
speaking
to
the
girl
in
french
an
alien
language
just
then
perhaps
there
would
be
something
to
forgive
if
i
were
on
my
side
a
great
deal
more
to
blame
than
you
will
you
let
confess
if
you
wish
otherwise
you
need
for
i
deserved
i
do
wish
but
first
will
you
answer
me
a
question
i
sure
you
would
ask
me
a
question
i
ought
to
answer
it
only
this
did
ernest
borrow
tell
you
anything
else
about
me
nothing
except
his
opinion
of
you
and
you
must
know
that
by
this
time
i
think
i
do
or
jones
or
east
neither
have
for
any
reason
you
to
apologize
to
me
for
what
you
very
nobly
felt
was
wrong
in
your
conduct
no
not
a
soul
has
advised
me
if
they
she
did
finish
but
biddy
and
i
both
knew
the
of
conscientiously
going
against
advice
thank
you
you
changed
your
opinion
of
me
then
without
urging
from
outside
it
has
all
come
from
from
recognition
of
of
what
you
are
and
what
you
done
for
for
us
all
you
been
a
hero
and
been
kind
as
well
as
brave
antoun
effendi
i
think
you
are
a
very
great
gentleman
and
i
respect
egyptians
for
your
sake
wait
said
anthony
you
have
heard
my
confession
when
i
first
saw
you
on
the
terrace
at
shepheard
i
willed
you
to
look
at
me
and
you
did
look
how
strange
yes
i
felt
it
something
made
me
look
why
did
you
will
me
antoun
effendi
monny
voice
was
soft
but
it
was
not
like
a
child
now
it
was
a
woman
voice
listening
with
tingling
ears
i
knew
what
she
wanted
him
to
answer
perhaps
he
also
knew
but
he
boldly
told
the
truth
it
was
a
kind
of
wager
i
made
with
myself
there
was
some
troublesome
business
i
had
to
carry
out
in
cairo
a
good
deal
hung
upon
it
i
saw
your
profile
you
did
turn
my
way
and
i
said
to
myself
by
willing
i
can
make
that
girl
look
at
me
i
take
it
for
a
sign
that
i
shall
succeed
in
my
work
oh
it
was
nothing
to
do
with
not
then
afterward
i
knew
that
while
i
thought
my
own
free
will
suggested
my
influencing
you
it
was
destiny
that
influenced
me
kismet
it
had
to
happen
so
but
you
punished
me
for
my
presumption
you
treated
me
as
if
i
were
a
slave
a
thing
that
hardly
had
a
place
in
your
world
i
know
that
what
i
asked
you
to
forgive
me
for
and
because
you
asked
me
to
forgive
i
telling
you
this
i
was
furious
and
i
said
shall
be
sorry
i
will
make
her
sorry
my
whole
wish
was
to
humble
you
i
wanted
to
conquer
and
though
you
classed
me
with
servants
to
be
your
master
i
do
blame
you
antoun
effendi
and
you
conquered
in
a
better
way
than
you
meant
when
you
were
angry
and
hating
me
conquered
by
showing
your
true
self
you
are
my
friend
that
what
you
want
is
it
not
to
be
my
master
when
you
do
hate
me
any
longer
no
that
is
not
what
i
want
i
still
want
to
be
your
master
then
you
hate
me
even
now
no
i
do
hate
you
mademoiselle
gilder
although
you
punished
me
over
and
over
again
for
being
the
brute
i
was
at
first
you
have
conquered
me
not
i
you
but
i
do
want
to
be
your
friend
if
you
did
look
at
me
as
being
a
man
beyond
the
pale
you
would
understand
very
well
what
i
want
do
say
that
cried
monny
quickly
do
say
that
you
a
man
beyond
the
pale
i
ca
stand
it
oh
i
know
what
you
want
i
do
understand
i
think
i
should
have
died
if
you
had
wanted
it
and
yet
i
could
almost
die
because
you
do
you
could
die
because
i
love
you
yes
of
joy
and
you
for
me
wait
i
could
die
of
joy
and
sorrow
too
joy
because
i
do
care
and
my
heart
longs
for
you
to
care
sorrow
because
oh
it
the
saddest
thing
in
the
world
but
we
can
never
be
any
more
to
each
other
than
we
are
now
you
say
that
so
firmly
because
you
think
of
me
in
your
heart
as
a
man
of
egypt
dearest
and
most
beautiful
you
are
great
enough
if
you
choose
to
mount
to
your
happiness
over
your
prejudice
if
you
can
love
me
in
spite
of
what
i
am
i
love
you
in
spite
of
it
and
because
of
it
too
and
for
every
reason
and
for
no
reason
thank
god
for
that
you
said
this
to
me
against
your
convictions
i
have
won
no
for
it
all
i
can
ever
say
there
can
be
no
more
between
us
you
could
love
me
enough
to
be
my
wife
though
i
tell
you
now
that
you
the
star
of
my
soul
never
till
i
saw
you
have
i
loved
a
woman
or
spoken
a
word
of
love
to
one
except
my
beautiful
mother
i
kept
all
for
you
more
than
i
dreamed
i
had
to
give
and
it
yours
for
ever
and
ever
but
just
because
you
said
to
yourself
that
we
of
stranger
races
who
must
meet
in
love
you
raise
a
barrier
between
us
are
our
souls
of
stranger
races
no
sometimes
it
almost
seems
as
if
our
souls
were
one
you
have
waked
mine
with
a
spark
from
your
own
i
think
i
was
fast
asleep
i
know
i
had
a
soul
scarcely
even
a
heart
but
now
i
know
learning
to
know
you
has
taught
me
to
know
myself
and
if
i
kinder
to
everybody
all
the
rest
of
my
life
even
silly
rich
people
i
used
to
think
need
kindness
it
will
be
through
loving
you
i
not
afraid
to
tell
you
that
and
though
i
to
be
afraid
i
might
love
you
i
glad
i
do
now
glad
i
shall
never
regret
anything
even
when
i
suffer
and
i
shall
suffer
when
we
parted
you
sure
we
must
part
sure
because
there
no
other
way
being
what
we
are
and
life
being
what
it
is
always
i
thought
since
my
father
died
that
he
was
near
me
watching
to
see
what
i
did
with
my
life
for
he
loved
me
dearly
and
i
loved
him
we
were
everything
to
each
other
even
if
that
were
the
only
reason
i
could
do
a
thing
that
would
have
broken
his
heart
it
would
be
treacherous
now
that
he
helpless
to
forbid
me
do
you
see
i
see
and
if
it
were
not
for
that
reason
if
it
were
not
for
that
oh
i
do
know
i
do
know
but
yes
i
do
know
the
truth
comes
to
me
it
speaks
out
of
my
heart
if
it
were
only
for
myself
if
i
felt
free
from
a
vow
nothing
could
make
me
say
to
you
out
of
my
life
that
what
i
wanted
to
be
sure
of
i
could
thank
you
on
my
knees
for
those
words
for
i
too
have
made
a
vow
which
i
wo
break
and
if
i
were
free
of
it
i
might
tell
you
a
thing
now
which
would
beat
down
the
barrier
well
we
will
keep
our
vows
both
of
us
my
queen
yes
we
must
keep
them
but
oh
how
are
we
to
bear
it
fate
has
brought
us
together
and
it
going
to
part
us
we
love
each
other
and
we
must
go
out
of
one
another
lives
what
shall
we
do
when
we
see
each
other
any
more
ever
any
more
that
time
shall
not
come
but
it
must
soon
will
you
trust
me
till
khartum
i
trust
you
always
i
mean
for
a
special
thing
just
till
khartum
in
the
foolish
days
when
i
wished
to
conquer
you
and
make
you
humble
yourself
to
me
i
vowed
by
my
mother
love
that
i
not
tell
you
or
let
borrow
tell
a
fact
about
myself
which
might
win
your
favour
it
was
a
bad
vow
to
make
a
stupid
vow
but
a
vow
by
my
mother
love
i
could
not
break
any
more
than
you
can
break
one
to
your
father
memory
i
abide
by
it
but
trust
me
till
khartum
and
there
you
shall
know
what
i
tell
you
now
i
always
hoped
you
would
find
out
there
if
we
went
as
far
as
khartum
together
then
i
hoped
because
i
was
a
conceited
fool
now
i
hope
this
thing
and
all
it
means
because
i
am
your
lover
ah
dear
antoun
do
hope
because
it
seems
to
me
that
nothing
nearer
than
heaven
can
bring
us
the
kind
of
happiness
you
want
if
you
had
told
me
you
cared
nothing
that
may
come
at
khartum
could
have
brought
any
happiness
to
me
at
all
for
it
would
have
been
too
late
after
that
for
you
to
say
you
cared
and
for
the
word
to
have
the
value
it
has
now
you
said
it
in
spite
of
yourself
trust
me
for
the
rest
will
you
if
you
ask
me
like
that
yes
i
trust
you
though
i
do
understand
that
what
i
want
say
this
believe
that
we
shall
be
happy
and
i
trust
without
understanding
that
it
will
be
proved
at
khartum
monny
repeated
the
words
after
him
and
although
i
was
that
vile
worm
an
eavesdropper
i
was
so
happy
that
i
could
have
picked
biddy
up
in
my
arms
and
waved
her
like
a
flag
anthony
was
going
to
be
happy
and
that
ought
to
be
a
good
omen
that
i
should
be
happy
too
i
am
almost
happy
now
monny
went
on
happier
than
i
thought
i
could
be
with
things
as
they
are
i
used
to
be
miserable
partly
about
myself
partly
because
i
thought
you
were
in
love
with
biddy
you
were
so
much
nicer
to
her
than
me
and
partly
because
i
believed
till
i
knew
you
well
that
you
wanted
to
marry
aunt
clara
for
money
though
you
cared
for
someone
else
i
even
told
lord
ernest
that
about
you
i
had
to
tell
somebody
and
besides
i
felt
it
would
be
good
for
him
to
think
you
cared
for
biddy
being
jealous
might
wake
him
up
to
see
that
he
was
in
love
with
her
himself
he
really
is
rather
a
duffer
at
times
and
oh
talking
of
him
and
biddy
reminds
me
of
them
where
can
they
be
all
this
time
heaven
alone
knows
or
cares
replied
anthony
and
i
realized
the
truth
of
the
proverb
about
listeners
even
where
their
best
friends
are
concerned
i
was
obliged
to
kiss
biddy
to
keep
from
laughing
out
loud
and
she
could
scream
or
box
my
ears
or
all
our
dreadful
precautions
would
have
been
vain
we
must
find
them
said
monny
why
oh
if
we
do
they
might
find
us
anthony
laughed
a
laugh
but
monny
did
not
recognize
its
birthplace
her
own
laugh
interrupted
it
too
soon
ringing
out
so
happily
it
probably
surprised
herself
they
find
us
here
quavered
biddy
clinging
to
me
they
ca
if
only
you
let
me
hold
you
tight
enough
i
whispered
if
they
look
in
they
just
take
us
for
a
black
spot
in
the
dark
but
they
did
look
in
they
went
downstairs
and
then
was
the
time
to
get
in
the
rest
of
my
deadly
work
with
biddy
we
wait
a
few
minutes
or
they
could
help
knowing
we
been
near
them
and
i
made
the
best
use
of
those
few
minutes
biddy
would
promise
anything
but
said
that
she
would
think
it
over
and
let
me
know
the
result
of
her
thinking
in
a
day
or
two
to
our
great
surprise
on
arriving
in
open
air
at
the
level
of
the
roof
below
we
saw
that
the
sun
was
gone
and
a
slim
young
moon
was
sliding
down
the
trail
it
is
indeed
wonderful
say
prophets
of
the
obvious
how
quickly
time
passes
when
your
attention
is
engaged
and
one
comfort
of
being
obvious
is
that
you
are
generally
right
we
tried
to
flit
forth
from
the
dark
recess
of
the
pylon
stairway
without
being
seen
or
heard
but
as
luck
would
have
it
monny
and
fenton
had
had
just
time
to
discover
that
our
boat
was
gone
the
girl
was
hunting
for
us
to
see
if
we
were
anywhere
or
if
in
some
mad
freak
we
could
have
gone
off
and
left
them
to
their
fate
as
we
sneaked
guiltily
out
she
caught
us
biddy
lord
ernest
she
exclaimed
why
why
you
have
been
a
good
rule
for
diplomats
duffers
and
others
is
never
to
tell
a
falsehood
when
there
is
no
hope
that
any
one
will
believe
it
we
er
yes
we
both
mumbled
but
there
is
any
upstairs
except
where
we
were
yes
there
is
biddy
assured
her
hastily
too
hastily
you
were
on
the
roof
we
were
in
the
little
room
of
the
guardian
he
showed
it
to
us
there
a
window
oh
we
were
it
you
must
both
have
heard
murder
will
out
i
said
with
the
calmness
of
despair
but
then
it
occurred
to
me
that
there
was
a
way
of
using
the
weapon
which
threatened
as
a
boomerang
dearest
biddy
adjured
her
beloved
humbly
you
would
have
had
us
spoil
everything
by
moving
would
you
i
said
to
the
duffer
when
he
wanted
to
do
something
desperate
we
interrupt
them
nothing
will
ever
come
right
besides
we
were
too
busy
getting
engaged
ourselves
said
i
to
bother
for
long
about
what
anybody
else
was
saying
or
doing
you
oh
biddy
that
what
i
prayed
for
nothing
of
the
sort
began
ferociously
but
the
boomerang
had
come
to
my
hand
and
i
caught
it
on
the
fly
before
she
could
go
on
contradicting
me
anthony
followed
by
the
guardian
of
the
temple
had
mounted
the
steps
from
the
lower
ledge
of
the
roof
where
we
had
landed
in
the
afternoon
it
was
you
who
took
the
boat
then
for
a
joke
said
fenton
at
sight
of
us
and
the
mystery
of
our
felucca
disappearance
had
to
be
discussed
biddy
saw
to
it
that
monny
could
edge
in
a
word
on
the
forbidden
subject
how
those
two
would
talk
later
in
miss
stateroom
nobody
could
explain
what
had
happened
not
even
the
guardian
he
it
seemed
spent
his
night
at
the
siren
temple
in
the
water
sleeping
in
the
cell
where
i
had
blackmailed
biddy
and
not
even
appearing
to
know
that
the
custom
scintillated
with
romance
by
and
by
his
companion
who
joined
him
for
night
work
would
arrive
in
a
small
boat
bringing
food
but
this
man
rowed
himself
and
neither
could
leave
the
temple
again
that
night
you
will
lend
the
boat
to
us
said
anthony
we
row
and
send
it
back
to
you
here
by
some
one
who
is
trustworthy
we
have
no
right
to
lend
the
boat
returned
the
nubian
then
i
will
steal
it
replied
the
hadji
but
none
of
us
cared
how
long
a
time
might
pass
before
deliverance
came
the
could
steam
away
and
leave
her
conductor
behind
as
east
had
disappeared
i
vaguely
associated
the
puzzle
of
our
missing
craft
with
sir
marcus
and
anyhow
curiosity
was
the
strongest
emotion
in
my
being
just
then
i
thought
that
perhaps
never
in
my
life
again
would
love
and
romance
and
beauty
all
blend
together
in
one
as
here
at
philae
in
the
moonlight
the
sharp
sickle
of
the
young
moon
cut
a
silver
edge
on
each
tiny
wave
that
murmured
against
the
submerged
pillars
like
a
chanting
of
priests
under
the
sea
the
temple
commemorating
love
triumphant
was
carved
in
silver
and
drowned
in
a
silver
flood
the
flowering
capitals
of
the
columns
as
they
showed
above
the
water
blossomed
white
as
lilies
bound
together
in
sheaves
with
silver
cords
and
placed
before
an
altar
yes
egypt
was
giving
us
what
we
asked
but
would
she
give
us
all
we
asked
just
as
there
might
have
been
a
renewed
chance
of
getting
an
answer
to
this
question
black
men
in
a
black
boat
hailed
us
sir
marcus
had
deigned
at
last
to
remember
our
plight
chapter
xxvii
the
inner
sanctuary
we
made
a
sensation
when
we
returned
to
the
fold
everybody
wondered
so
much
that
they
gave
us
no
time
to
answer
their
questions
even
if
we
would
but
somehow
it
seemed
to
be
taken
for
granted
that
the
whole
thing
was
my
fault
perhaps
east
or
sir
marcus
had
spread
the
report
i
let
it
pass
as
for
sir
marcus
he
stayed
only
long
enough
for
a
talk
with
me
it
began
with
business
and
ended
in
a
confession
she
had
snubbed
him
it
seemed
snubs
being
new
to
sir
marcus
he
had
been
dazed
and
had
forgotten
for
a
while
to
send
us
a
boat
i
assured
him
that
we
bore
no
grudge
really
none
whatever
it
had
been
quite
an
adventure
and
i
tried
to
cheer
him
up
better
luck
next
time
why
would
he
go
on
with
us
fenton
and
i
could
chum
together
to
give
him
and
neill
sheridan
the
american
egyptologist
had
let
me
know
that
he
was
obliged
to
leave
us
at
wady
haifa
there
would
be
an
empty
cabin
going
down
again
but
no
the
boss
refused
his
conductor
hospitality
i
think
the
less
she
sees
of
me
the
better
she
likes
me
he
said
dismally
she
was
civil
enough
until
i
but
no
matter
i
suppose
a
man
ca
expect
his
luck
to
always
hold
do
split
your
infinitives
till
things
get
desperate
i
begged
it
has
come
to
that
yet
if
you
must
go
back
i
take
it
on
my
shoulders
to
watch
your
private
interests
a
bit
as
well
as
the
rest
look
out
for
a
telegram
one
of
these
fine
days
saying
at
once
you
know
what
it
means
i
will
bless
you
my
boy
he
said
heartily
though
i
am
hanged
if
i
know
what
you
mean
by
a
split
infinitive
i
hope
if
its
improper
never
inadvertently
done
it
before
a
lady
there
seemed
to
be
an
atmosphere
of
suspense
for
everybody
who
mattered
as
we
steamed
on
between
strange
black
mountainettes
and
sands
toward
wady
halfa
anthony
was
in
suspense
about
the
way
his
fate
might
arrange
itself
at
khartum
i
was
in
suspense
as
to
biddy
decision
which
nothing
i
was
able
to
say
could
wheedle
or
browbeat
out
of
her
he
and
i
were
both
in
suspense
together
about
the
mountain
of
the
golden
pyramid
it
would
be
ours
now
we
knew
that
but
what
would
be
in
it
would
it
be
full
of
treasure
or
full
of
nothing
but
mountain
just
as
a
crusty
baked
pudding
is
full
of
pudding
the
doubt
was
harder
to
bear
now
that
anthony
was
in
love
with
a
very
rich
girl
and
desired
something
from
the
mountain
more
substantial
than
the
adventure
which
would
once
have
contented
him
harder
to
bear
for
me
too
wanting
biddy
and
wanting
to
give
her
luxury
as
well
as
peace
such
as
she
had
never
known
in
her
life
of
tragedy
and
brave
laughter
monny
was
in
suspense
quite
equal
to
anthony
about
khartum
and
what
could
possibly
happen
there
to
give
her
happiness
brigit
was
in
suspense
about
the
two
men
who
had
so
strangely
and
secretly
worked
with
their
spy
bedr
and
whom
she
expected
to
meet
again
later
rachel
was
in
suspense
about
bailey
although
i
had
told
her
it
was
going
to
be
all
right
and
he
had
said
not
a
word
of
the
business
to
her
what
she
wanted
was
to
make
sure
of
him
and
there
was
the
difficulty
at
present
since
we
had
failed
to
arrange
for
a
or
a
clergyman
on
board
other
hearts
were
no
doubt
throbbing
with
the
same
emotions
but
they
were
of
comparatively
small
importance
to
me
our
feelings
were
all
so
different
and
so
much
more
intense
than
they
had
been
that
the
extraordinary
difference
in
the
scenery
gave
us
a
vague
sense
of
satisfaction
we
were
in
another
world
now
that
we
had
heard
the
first
cataract
roar
and
left
it
behind
a
world
utterly
unlike
any
conceptions
we
had
formed
of
egypt
but
we
did
not
for
a
long
time
leave
the
influence
of
the
barrage
black
rocks
ringed
in
a
blue
basin
so
that
it
was
hard
to
realize
it
as
the
nile
now
and
then
a
yellow
river
of
sand
poured
down
to
the
sapphire
sea
and
where
its
bright
waves
were
reflected
the
water
became
liquid
gold
under
a
surface
of
blue
glass
the
sky
was
overcast
and
through
a
thick
silver
veil
the
sun
shone
with
a
mystic
light
as
of
a
lamp
burning
in
an
alabaster
globe
yet
the
flaming
gold
of
the
sand
created
an
illusion
as
of
sunshine
it
was
as
if
the
treasure
of
all
the
lost
mines
of
nub
had
been
flung
out
on
the
black
rocks
and
lay
in
a
glittering
carpet
there
we
passed
small
submerged
temples
with
their
foreheads
just
above
water
drowning
palm
groves
whose
plumes
trailed
sadly
on
the
blue
expanse
and
deserted
where
the
high
nile
looked
in
at
open
doors
to
say
this
is
for
egypt
good
then
there
was
the
little
temple
of
dendur
whose
patron
goddess
was
prayed
to
spit
if
rain
were
needed
and
so
many
other
ruined
temples
that
we
lost
count
though
one
was
the
largest
in
nubia
until
we
came
to
the
valley
of
the
lions
this
we
remembered
not
because
it
was
imposing
or
because
it
had
a
dromos
of
sphinxes
the
only
ones
in
egypt
or
because
of
its
prehistoric
writings
on
dark
boulders
or
because
it
had
been
used
as
a
christian
church
but
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
ladies
bought
rag
dolls
from
little
nubian
girls
who
wore
their
hair
in
a
million
greased
braids
here
the
influence
of
the
dam
faded
out
of
sight
forlorn
trees
and
houses
no
longer
crawled
half
out
of
water
mountains
crowded
down
to
the
shore
wild
and
dark
and
stately
as
nubian
warriors
of
ancient
days
then
came
korosko
point
of
departure
for
the
old
caravan
route
where
kings
of
forgotten
egyptian
dynasties
sent
for
acacia
wood
and
englishmen
in
the
campaign
of
the
cataracts
fought
and
died
deserted
now
with
houses
dead
and
decayed
their
windows
staring
like
the
of
skulls
and
the
black
tortured
behind
lurking
in
the
background
as
hyenas
lurk
to
prey
more
temples
and
many
sakkeyehs
no
shadoofs
here
on
the
upper
nile
but
few
boats
the
spacious
times
were
past
when
loads
of
pink
granite
sandstone
fragrant
woods
and
spices
from
the
land
of
punt
went
floating
down
the
stream
there
were
tombs
as
well
as
temples
which
we
might
have
seen
savage
gorges
and
mild
green
hills
there
was
the
great
grim
fort
of
kasr
ibrim
and
at
last
there
was
abu
simbel
somehow
i
knew
that
things
were
bound
to
happen
at
abu
simbel
i
know
what
they
would
be
but
they
hovered
invisible
at
my
in
the
night
and
whispered
to
warn
me
that
i
might
expect
them
a
few
people
rose
stealthily
before
dawn
to
prepare
for
abu
simbel
because
it
had
been
hammered
into
their
intellects
by
me
that
this
was
the
great
thing
of
the
upper
nile
also
that
every
he
she
or
it
who
did
not
behold
the
place
at
sunrise
would
be
as
mean
a
worm
as
one
who
had
not
read
the
arabian
nights
not
everybody
heeded
the
advice
though
at
bedtime
most
had
resolved
to
do
so
we
had
anchored
for
the
night
not
far
off
in
order
to
have
the
mysterious
light
before
to
go
on
again
and
see
the
grand
approach
to
the
grandest
temple
of
the
old
world
but
after
all
most
of
the
cabin
eyelids
were
still
down
when
we
arrived
before
dawn
at
our
journey
end
and
only
a
few
intrepid
ghosts
flitted
out
on
deck
elderly
male
ghosts
in
thick
youthful
ghosts
of
the
same
sex
fully
clothed
and
decently
groomed
because
of
cloaked
with
floating
hair
if
there
were
enough
to
float
effectively
others
made
a
virtue
of
having
it
put
up
and
female
ghosts
with
transformations
apparently
in
front
no
ghost
looks
mattered
much
however
for
good
or
ill
once
the
slowly
moving
had
swept
aside
a
purple
curtain
of
distance
and
shown
us
such
a
stagesetting
as
only
nature
stupendous
theatre
can
give
it
was
a
stage
still
dimly
but
most
effectively
revealed
lights
down
pale
blue
lilac
and
cold
green
a
thrilling
almost
sinister
combination
no
gold
or
rose
switched
on
yet
turned
obliquely
toward
the
river
facing
slightly
northward
four
figures
sat
on
thrones
immobile
incredible
against
a
background
of
rock
whence
they
had
been
released
by
forgotten
sculptors
released
to
live
while
the
world
lasted
these
seated
kings
gave
the
first
shock
of
awed
admiration
then
lesser
marvels
detached
themselves
in
detail
from
the
shadows
of
the
vast
façade
the
frieze
the
cornice
the
in
his
niche
over
the
door
of
the
great
temple
the
smaller
temple
of
hathor
divided
from
her
huge
brother
by
a
cataract
of
sand
whose
piled
already
called
the
sun
as
a
magnet
calls
iron
the
were
still
down
when
the
moored
by
the
river
bank
within
a
comparatively
short
walk
of
the
mountain
which
rameses
ii
had
turned
into
a
temple
as
usual
glorifying
himself
but
though
the
walk
was
comparatively
short
on
second
thoughts
elderly
ghosts
already
chilled
to
the
bone
funked
it
on
empty
stomachs
they
made
various
excuses
for
putting
off
the
excursion
the
boat
was
to
remain
till
late
afternoon
until
finally
the
were
reduced
to
a
party
of
ten
since
philae
biddy
had
kept
out
of
my
way
when
she
could
do
so
without
being
actually
rude
but
as
our
small
shivering
procession
formed
she
suddenly
appeared
at
my
side
thus
we
two
headed
the
band
save
for
a
sleepy
dragoman
who
knew
the
rather
intricate
paths
through
scaly
dried
mud
sand
and
vegetation
i
want
to
say
something
to
you
duffer
she
murmured
and
the
roughness
of
the
way
excused
me
for
slipping
her
arm
through
mine
not
as
much
as
i
want
to
say
something
to
you
i
retorted
fervently
but
this
is
she
reproached
me
so
is
please
listen
there
is
much
time
i
heard
this
only
last
night
or
i
have
spoken
before
and
asked
you
what
you
thought
do
you
happen
to
know
whether
captain
fenton
wrote
a
note
to
monny
asking
her
to
wait
for
him
in
the
inner
sanctuary
of
the
temple
till
after
the
people
had
gone
as
he
wanted
to
see
her
alone
about
something
of
great
importance
i
do
know
i
said
anthony
has
mentioned
miss
gilder
name
to
me
since
philae
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
been
particularly
taciturn
you
have
quarrelled
surely
anthony
and
i
thank
goodness
no
but
i
afraid
he
misunderstands
and
is
a
bit
annoyed
miss
gilder
of
course
told
him
we
overheard
a
certain
conversation
and
he
never
given
me
a
chance
to
explain
after
khartum
it
will
be
all
right
if
not
before
but
meanwhile
i
see
then
let
me
tell
you
quickly
what
happened
when
we
came
back
on
board
the
boat
after
climbing
about
the
fort
of
kasr
ibrim
monny
found
on
the
table
in
her
cabin
a
note
in
french
typewritten
on
paper
it
had
no
beginning
or
signature
only
an
urgent
request
to
grant
the
writer
five
minutes
just
after
sunrise
in
the
sanctuary
at
abu
simbel
soon
as
every
one
was
out
of
the
there
only
one
typewriter
on
board
is
there
yes
kruger
and
nobody
but
you
and
he
and
captain
fenton
ever
use
it
i
suppose
nobody
else
so
far
as
i
know
captain
fenton
did
land
with
us
to
see
the
fort
but
came
up
later
just
as
we
were
ready
to
go
down
well
for
all
these
reasons
and
the
note
being
in
french
monny
thinks
it
was
written
by
antoun
effendi
it
was
only
in
chatting
last
night
about
the
sunrise
expedition
that
she
mentioned
finding
the
letter
i
begged
her
to
make
certain
it
from
him
before
doing
what
it
asked
because
you
see
i
still
afraid
of
anything
that
seems
queer
or
mysterious
but
she
laughed
and
said
nonsense
who
else
could
have
written
it
except
lord
ernest
unless
you
think
kruger
in
a
plot
and
she
refused
to
question
antoun
because
if
he
wanted
the
thing
to
be
talked
over
he
have
spoken
instead
of
writing
as
for
doing
what
he
asked
she
pretended
not
to
have
made
up
her
mind
she
said
she
what
mood
she
was
in
after
the
others
had
finished
with
the
sanctuary
well
what
i
want
is
for
you
and
me
to
stay
in
the
place
ourselves
when
the
others
have
gone
with
the
greatest
of
pleasure
on
earth
said
i
do
be
foolish
you
are
to
torment
me
there
that
depends
on
what
you
call
if
i
to
be
made
a
for
fenton
and
miss
gilder
a
kind
of
live
scarecrow
i
mean
to
get
something
out
of
it
for
myself
there
was
no
time
for
more
we
had
arrived
at
the
foot
of
the
long
flight
of
stone
steps
which
lead
up
to
the
rocky
plateau
of
the
great
temple
in
the
east
a
golden
fire
below
the
horizon
was
sending
up
premonitory
flames
and
the
procession
must
bestir
itself
or
be
too
late
the
whole
object
of
arriving
at
this
unearthly
hour
would
be
defeated
if
before
the
sun
forefinger
touched
the
faces
of
the
altar
statues
we
were
not
in
the
sanctuary
no
time
to
study
the
features
of
the
colossi
or
to
search
for
the
grave
of
major
tidwell
these
things
must
wait
the
guardian
examined
our
tickets
and
let
us
file
through
the
doorway
whose
iron
he
had
just
opened
as
we
passed
into
the
cavernous
hall
of
roughly
carved
osiride
columns
the
huge
figures
attached
to
them
loomed
vaguely
out
of
purple
gloom
there
was
an
impression
of
sculptured
rock
walls
with
splashes
of
colour
here
and
there
of
columns
in
a
chamber
beyond
and
still
a
third
chamber
whence
three
rooms
opened
off
the
side
doorways
mere
blocks
of
ebony
in
the
dimness
but
already
the
sun
first
ray
groped
for
its
goal
like
the
wandering
finger
of
a
blind
man
we
had
only
time
to
hurry
through
the
faintly
lit
middle
doorway
and
plaster
ourselves
round
the
rock
walls
of
the
sanctuary
when
the
golden
digit
touched
the
altar
and
found
the
four
sculptured
forms
above
harmachis
rameses
amen
and
ptah
night
lingered
in
the
temple
a
black
brooding
vulture
but
suddenly
the
bird
dark
breast
was
struck
by
a
golden
bullet
and
from
the
wound
a
magic
radiance
grew
the
effect
carefully
calculated
by
priests
and
builders
thousands
of
years
ago
was
as
thrilling
as
on
the
morning
when
the
sun
first
poured
gold
upon
the
altar
the
sightless
faces
of
the
statues
were
given
eyes
of
an
unearthly
brilliance
to
stare
into
ours
and
search
our
souls
but
with
most
of
the
party
to
be
thrilled
for
a
minute
was
enough
as
the
finger
began
to
move
they
found
it
time
to
move
also
there
was
the
whole
temple
to
be
seen
and
then
the
walk
back
to
the
boat
before
dressing
for
breakfast
soon
biddy
and
i
had
or
seemed
to
have
the
sanctuary
to
ourselves
even
the
sun
ray
had
left
us
mounting
higher
and
passing
above
the
doorway
of
the
inner
shrine
the
momentarily
disturbed
shadows
folded
round
us
again
with
only
a
faint
glimmer
on
the
wall
over
the
altar
to
show
that
day
was
born
did
you
notice
that
monny
was
with
the
others
asked
brigit
in
a
low
voice
she
lingered
behind
i
think
and
never
came
near
us
i
was
sure
till
i
watched
the
rest
filing
out
of
this
room
then
i
saw
she
was
among
them
neither
was
captain
fenton
if
they
together
it
all
right
i
assured
her
yes
but
are
they
that
affair
of
the
typewritten
note
has
worried
me
you
very
nervous
darling
but
no
wonder
you
must
call
me
why
not
it
no
worse
than
duffer
i
like
your
calling
me
that
i
wonder
if
we
ought
to
go
as
she
never
came
or
stay
and
wait
if
we
go
we
shall
be
playing
into
miss
gilder
hands
if
we
stay
we
shall
be
playing
into
mine
which
do
you
prefer
oh
i
suppose
we
better
stay
for
fear
of
something
but
you
must
be
good
then
abruptly
i
attacked
her
with
a
change
of
weapons
i
had
fenced
lightly
knowing
that
biddy
liked
a
man
who
could
laugh
but
now
i
threw
away
my
rapier
and
snatched
a
club
i
told
her
i
would
stand
no
more
of
this
did
she
want
to
spoil
my
life
and
break
my
heart
she
was
the
one
thing
i
needed
now
she
would
have
to
say
whether
she
put
me
off
because
she
did
love
me
and
never
could
or
because
of
that
trash
about
not
wanting
to
involve
me
in
her
troubles
no
use
prevaricating
i
should
know
whether
she
lied
or
told
the
truth
by
the
sound
of
her
voice
but
i
might
as
well
confess
before
she
began
that
i
rather
be
loved
by
her
and
refused
than
loved
and
refused
women
seemed
to
think
the
unselfish
thing
was
to
pretend
not
to
care
if
a
man
had
to
be
sent
away
because
in
the
end
that
made
it
easier
for
him
but
in
real
life
with
a
real
man
it
was
the
other
way
round
i
think
you
right
duffer
biddy
said
softly
that
why
i
would
answer
you
for
good
and
all
that
night
at
philae
i
felt
then
it
might
be
kinder
to
tell
you
i
could
never
care
but
i
thought
of
nothing
else
since
except
a
little
about
monny
and
i
decided
that
if
it
were
i
rather
be
loved
whatever
happened
men
ca
be
so
very
different
where
their
hearts
are
concerned
so
i
going
to
tell
you
i
love
you
it
was
hard
to
give
you
to
monny
but
i
thought
it
would
be
for
your
happiness
i
nearly
died
of
love
for
you
when
i
was
a
little
girl
i
kept
every
tiniest
thing
you
ever
gave
me
i
was
in
love
with
your
memory
when
you
went
up
to
oxford
and
it
was
then
richard
came
he
swept
me
off
my
feet
and
made
me
think
my
heart
was
caught
in
the
rebound
when
it
was
too
late
i
realised
that
it
been
caught
at
all
only
hypnotized
for
a
while
i
loved
you
always
duffer
dear
the
thought
of
you
was
my
one
comfort
often
although
i
hardly
expected
to
see
you
again
or
maybe
for
that
very
reason
no
do
touch
me
please
let
me
go
on
now
or
i
not
tell
you
any
more
i
wonder
if
you
never
guessed
what
i
had
in
that
bag
you
so
worried
about
why
yes
i
did
guess
biddy
right
or
wrong
and
i
you
it
was
wrong
what
did
you
think
when
i
understand
any
of
your
hints
to
tell
what
i
wore
over
my
heart
i
thought
then
i
answered
after
a
moment
deliberation
that
you
kept
compromising
documents
which
might
be
of
interest
to
the
organization
you
and
i
have
talked
about
now
i
think
differently
i
think
you
kept
a
lock
of
my
childish
hair
or
my
first
tooth
you
conceited
duffer
not
so
bad
as
that
because
i
had
never
a
chance
of
getting
either
once
i
keep
in
that
bag
just
what
you
said
compromising
documents
that
the
organization
would
have
given
thousands
of
dollars
to
get
and
my
life
would
have
stood
in
their
way
for
a
minute
i
sure
but
that
was
before
richard
died
he
was
afraid
i
mean
i
thought
it
would
be
better
and
less
suspicious
if
had
charge
of
the
papers
and
if
the
society
had
ever
got
hold
of
him
he
believed
the
letters
and
lists
of
names
i
had
might
have
bought
back
his
safety
if
i
played
my
hand
well
he
told
me
just
what
to
do
but
when
he
was
ill
he
had
a
nurse
whom
i
began
to
suspect
as
a
spy
once
when
i
was
called
into
richard
room
suddenly
half
dressed
the
bag
showed
as
my
wrapper
fell
open
at
the
breast
i
caught
her
looking
at
it
with
an
eager
look
and
that
very
night
i
had
it
locked
up
in
a
bank
it
was
only
a
few
days
later
that
richard
died
and
with
him
gone
i
felt
there
was
no
more
need
to
keep
papers
which
might
cost
the
lives
or
liberty
of
men
richard
had
wronged
his
friends
and
i
wanted
none
of
them
to
come
to
harm
through
me
though
they
made
me
suffer
with
him
i
burned
every
scrap
of
paper
i
had
every
single
one
and
it
was
till
there
was
an
attempt
to
kidnap
esmé
that
i
asked
myself
if
i
been
right
still
even
now
i
am
not
sorry
i
would
hurt
a
hair
of
their
heads
for
a
while
the
bag
was
empty
but
coming
away
from
america
and
feeling
a
bit
lonesome
i
thought
it
would
do
me
good
to
look
now
and
then
at
the
only
you
ever
wrote
me
it
was
on
my
ninth
birthday
but
i
believe
you
could
write
a
better
one
now
there
was
a
photograph
too
of
my
lord
when
he
was
seventeen
i
stole
that
but
it
was
all
the
dearer
at
this
very
minute
the
letter
and
the
picture
are
lying
on
my
heart
so
now
you
know
whether
i
care
for
you
or
not
and
you
can
understand
why
i
would
put
the
bag
into
a
bank
oh
biddy
darling
i
said
you
made
me
the
happiest
man
in
the
world
well
i
glad
she
snapped
twisting
away
from
me
that
it
takes
so
little
to
make
you
happy
so
little
when
i
going
to
have
you
for
my
wife
but
you
not
you
said
you
rather
be
loved
and
refused
i
would
if
i
had
to
choose
between
the
two
that
not
the
case
with
me
for
i
shall
marry
you
now
i
know
the
truth
in
spite
of
fifty
or
fifty
thousand
refusals
or
any
other
little
obstacles
like
that
never
duffer
not
for
all
the
world
would
i
be
your
wife
loving
you
as
i
do
unless
the
organization
would
forget
or
forgive
esmé
and
me
and
that
i
ca
fancy
they
ever
do
till
the
millenium
i
shall
be
past
the
marrying
age
then
oh
duffer
i
wish
you
had
fallen
in
love
with
monny
as
i
wanted
you
to
do
honest
injun
you
really
wanted
that
to
happen
well
i
tried
to
want
it
for
your
sake
and
in
a
way
for
my
own
too
if
i
seen
you
caring
for
monny
i
should
have
found
some
medicine
to
cure
my
heartache
oh
it
would
have
been
a
very
good
thing
all
around
except
for
your
friend
anthony
fenton
and
i
was
half
afraid
he
was
in
love
with
you
i
can
tell
you
i
had
my
trials
biddy
it
my
turn
to
be
happy
now
and
yours
too
just
think
nearly
everybody
in
the
world
is
engaged
but
us
or
next
door
to
being
engaged
miss
gilder
and
anthony
who
the
only
man
on
earth
to
keep
her
in
order
and
rachel
guest
and
bailey
and
enid
biddell
and
harry
snell
and
even
your
stepdaughter
esmé
duffer
she
what
to
young
halloran
how
did
they
manage
it
i
do
know
yet
i
had
only
a
telegram
it
came
to
assuan
too
late
and
sir
marcus
lark
brought
it
to
the
boat
i
found
it
that
night
when
we
got
back
from
philae
but
i
have
told
because
i
dared
not
be
with
you
alone
long
enough
to
speak
of
private
affairs
till
i
could
decide
whether
to
let
you
know
i
loved
you
or
make
believe
i
care
a
scrap
as
if
i
could
have
believed
your
tongue
unless
you
had
shut
your
eyes
so
esmé
is
married
and
off
your
hands
not
off
my
hands
i
afraid
this
may
be
visited
on
me
they
must
have
known
of
her
meeting
tom
halloran
at
martin
vesubie
last
summer
they
find
out
everything
sooner
or
later
probably
they
thought
i
whisked
her
off
to
egypt
with
me
helped
by
my
rich
friend
miss
gilder
for
whom
they
took
rachel
guest
in
order
to
let
her
meet
tom
halloran
again
and
marry
him
secretly
well
she
has
him
secretly
when
they
discover
what
happened
they
sure
to
put
the
blame
on
poor
me
and
indeed
it
is
a
shocking
thing
for
the
son
of
that
man
in
prison
and
the
daughter
of
the
man
who
sent
him
there
to
be
husband
and
wife
i
do
see
that
at
all
i
argued
why
should
their
love
end
the
feud
it
ca
for
strong
as
it
may
be
it
wo
release
prisoners
or
bring
back
to
life
those
who
are
dead
anyhow
do
borrow
trouble
said
i
if
esmé
married
the
more
reason
for
us
to
follow
her
example
after
khartum
when
miss
gilder
who
taking
my
name
in
vain
inquired
the
owner
of
it
at
the
sanctuary
door
oh
then
you
come
monny
brigit
exclaimed
i
i
given
you
up
i
have
come
for
the
reason
you
thought
returned
the
girl
promptly
i
was
sure
you
meant
to
head
me
off
and
i
learned
without
asking
that
antoun
effendi
did
write
that
note
i
told
you
so
who
did
he
trying
to
find
out
probably
it
was
a
silly
practical
joke
some
one
wanted
to
play
on
me
there
are
quite
capable
of
it
on
board
antoun
effendi
said
the
sunrise
was
much
finer
really
from
on
top
of
the
great
sandhill
so
we
climbed
up
and
it
came
out
that
he
had
asked
me
to
meet
him
here
if
any
one
not
on
the
boat
wrote
the
letter
some
steward
must
have
been
bribed
to
sell
a
bit
of
and
allow
a
stranger
to
come
on
board
while
we
were
away
at
kasr
ibrim
there
was
a
steam
dahabeah
moored
not
far
off
if
you
remember
with
oriental
decorations
so
we
fancied
it
must
belong
to
an
egyptian
or
a
turk
it
could
easily
have
been
hired
at
assuan
biddy
exclaimed
and
it
could
have
beaten
us
we
stopped
at
such
heaps
of
temples
where
other
boats
only
touch
coming
back
if
there
were
a
plot
as
you
are
always
imagining
the
dahabeah
would
have
to
be
near
here
too
monny
laughed
incredulously
and
so
it
may
be
we
have
seen
round
the
corner
of
the
great
temple
yet
one
would
think
to
hear
you
talk
that
you
expected
this
poor
little
sanctuary
to
be
stuffed
with
murderers
or
at
the
least
kidnappers
ugh
do
speak
of
it
biddy
shuddered
let
go
out
into
the
sunlight
again
as
quick
as
ever
we
can
chapter
xxviii
worth
paying
for
when
anthony
says
that
he
will
find
out
things
he
seldom
fails
perhaps
nobody
but
a
hadji
could
so
speedily
have
screwed
information
out
of
secretive
arabs
paid
to
be
silent
and
he
had
to
fit
deductions
into
spaces
of
the
puzzle
left
empty
by
fibs
and
glib
what
he
did
learn
was
this
a
dragoman
had
come
in
a
small
boat
from
a
steam
dahabeah
to
the
while
we
were
away
at
kasr
ibrim
he
presented
credentials
written
out
for
him
in
cairo
by
miss
rachel
guest
and
dated
a
few
weeks
ago
inquiring
for
her
he
seemed
sorry
to
hear
that
she
had
gone
on
the
excursion
the
dragoman
refused
to
disturb
antoun
effendi
on
hearing
that
the
hadji
was
writing
in
his
cabin
his
errand
was
not
of
enough
importance
to
trouble
so
illustrious
a
man
all
he
wanted
was
permission
to
type
one
or
two
letters
for
his
employers
on
the
neighbouring
dahabeah
which
possessed
no
machine
in
the
absence
of
kruger
who
had
gone
on
shore
for
exercise
the
dragoman
was
given
this
privilege
possibly
he
had
taken
some
of
the
boat
who
could
be
certain
of
these
trifles
possibly
also
he
had
walked
about
with
one
of
the
cabin
stewards
to
see
the
luxurious
appointments
of
the
as
for
paying
money
for
these
small
favours
who
could
tell
and
nobody
knew
if
the
steam
dahabeah
had
hurried
on
before
us
to
anchor
out
of
sight
round
the
oblique
façade
of
abu
simbel
in
any
case
when
we
went
to
look
for
the
suspicious
craft
seen
near
kasr
ibrim
she
was
not
among
the
two
or
three
small
private
dahabeahs
of
artists
and
others
moored
within
a
mile
of
the
great
temple
notwithstanding
her
absence
however
anthony
and
i
suddenly
confidential
friends
again
thought
it
likely
that
the
shadows
in
the
sanctuary
had
not
been
its
only
tenants
when
we
entered
there
the
invaluable
bedr
knew
enough
of
the
nile
temples
to
know
that
the
sun
first
light
strikes
only
the
altar
and
the
statues
over
it
in
abu
simbel
inner
shrine
that
the
four
corners
of
the
small
remain
pitch
black
unless
the
place
is
artificially
illuminated
and
that
this
is
never
done
at
sunrise
the
dragoman
and
one
or
both
of
his
employers
would
have
had
no
difficulty
in
getting
into
the
temple
before
the
first
streak
of
dawn
if
they
had
warned
its
guardian
the
night
before
so
far
our
deductions
were
simple
after
learning
how
the
trick
of
the
typewritten
note
had
been
managed
but
it
was
not
so
easy
to
guess
the
object
of
the
plot
was
monny
gilder
to
have
been
murdered
in
the
dark
sanctuary
or
was
she
to
have
been
kidnapped
either
seemed
an
impossible
undertaking
unless
the
plotters
were
willing
to
face
certain
detection
and
arrest
as
it
was
we
had
no
more
tangible
proof
against
the
man
than
we
had
before
at
the
house
of
the
crocodile
in
the
desert
near
medinet
at
asiut
and
at
luxor
with
a
sly
cleverness
which
did
bedr
or
those
employing
him
much
credit
they
had
screened
themselves
behind
others
even
if
we
had
the
names
of
the
tourists
bedr
had
served
as
dragoman
and
if
we
could
lay
our
hands
on
their
shoulders
we
had
not
enough
evidence
of
what
they
had
done
to
obtain
a
warrant
of
arrest
and
this
of
course
they
knew
our
best
chance
anthony
thought
lay
in
springing
a
surprise
on
them
as
they
had
vainly
so
far
tried
to
do
with
us
and
when
we
got
them
somehow
at
our
mercy
force
out
the
truth
it
was
almost
certain
that
a
steam
dahabeah
could
not
unseen
have
passed
the
at
abu
simbel
in
broad
daylight
going
back
toward
assuan
therefore
since
it
was
not
moored
near
the
temple
if
it
had
been
in
the
neighbourhood
at
all
it
must
have
dashed
on
ahead
of
us
in
the
direction
of
wady
haifa
with
pleasure
would
we
have
given
immediate
chase
had
not
the
been
pledged
to
remain
at
abu
simbel
till
afternoon
even
as
it
was
i
expected
to
catch
up
with
a
boat
so
much
smaller
than
our
own
but
anthony
damped
my
hopes
explaining
the
difficulties
of
navigation
between
abu
simbel
and
wady
haifa
there
were
he
said
great
shifting
sandbanks
in
the
water
which
looked
so
transparently
green
so
treacherously
clear
without
the
most
prudent
piloting
the
river
was
actually
dangerous
as
new
sandbanks
had
a
habit
of
forming
the
minute
you
shut
your
eyes
or
turned
your
back
the
would
have
to
pick
her
way
slowly
through
the
silver
sands
of
the
nile
which
mingled
with
the
spilt
of
the
desert
shore
all
the
same
these
impudent
rascals
would
find
it
hard
to
hide
from
us
at
wady
haifa
especially
if
we
stopped
the
boat
and
wired
from
the
next
telegraph
station
to
have
them
watched
on
the
arrival
of
their
dahabeah
perhaps
as
they
so
clever
they
be
clever
enough
not
to
arrive
at
all
was
my
suggestion
and
anthony
could
only
shrug
his
shoulders
wait
and
see
had
to
be
our
policy
happily
the
set
wandered
in
and
out
of
the
two
temples
big
and
little
all
the
morning
ignorant
of
our
worries
which
even
to
us
seemed
small
under
the
benign
gaze
of
the
great
colossi
the
three
stone
rameses
who
had
faces
wore
expressions
no
one
could
ever
forget
and
there
was
a
sense
of
loss
in
turning
away
from
them
a
crocodile
swam
past
the
as
she
steamed
up
river
a
long
dark
prehistoric
shape
he
seemed
an
anachronism
but
so
did
bedr
with
his
plottings
yet
both
were
real
real
as
this
of
dark
rocks
of
conical
black
mountains
shaped
like
ruined
pyramids
and
yellow
sandhills
whose
dazzling
reflections
turned
the
river
to
gold
the
next
day
at
noon
we
came
to
wady
halfa
and
the
who
had
brought
us
eight
hundred
miles
from
cairo
was
now
to
be
deserted
by
those
with
khartum
in
view
all
save
three
of
the
party
were
going
on
through
this
gate
of
the
sudan
where
the
river
way
ended
and
the
began
neill
sheridan
was
turning
back
immediately
in
a
government
steamer
and
a
bride
and
groom
who
cared
not
where
they
were
if
with
each
other
would
wait
on
board
the
until
the
band
of
passengers
should
return
from
khartum
these
things
had
to
be
thought
of
but
i
meant
to
let
kruger
do
most
of
the
thinking
when
we
landed
at
the
neat
colourful
town
of
halfa
which
lies
as
assuan
lies
all
pink
and
blue
and
green
along
the
river
bank
sentinelled
with
trees
from
a
distance
anthony
and
i
caught
sight
of
the
steam
dahabeah
seen
near
kasr
ibrim
and
we
could
hardly
wait
to
get
on
shore
the
camp
was
but
a
mile
and
a
half
away
and
i
had
wired
in
lark
name
to
an
officer
whom
he
was
sure
to
know
asking
as
a
great
favour
to
have
the
passengers
on
board
a
boat
of
that
description
watched
and
requesting
him
if
possible
to
meet
the
on
her
arrival
there
he
is
said
fenton
standing
at
the
rail
i
must
seem
to
recognise
him
of
course
ca
give
myself
away
but
you
good
lord
there
bedr
i
broke
in
hardly
believing
my
eyes
and
there
bedr
was
looking
as
if
butter
would
by
no
means
melt
in
his
mouth
bedr
smiling
from
the
pier
evidently
there
for
the
special
purpose
of
meeting
us
his
ugly
squat
figure
and
the
tall
form
of
the
officer
were
conspicuous
among
squatting
blacks
male
and
female
in
gay
turbans
veils
and
mantles
muffled
babies
in
arms
and
children
dressed
in
exceedingly
brief
fringes
i
attend
to
him
while
you
powwow
with
ireton
said
anthony
ready
for
the
unexpected
situation
and
while
the
indispensable
if
humble
kruger
showed
the
passengers
how
to
get
to
the
desert
train
superintended
the
landing
of
the
luggage
and
made
himself
perspiringly
useful
i
thanked
major
ireton
in
sir
marcus
lark
and
my
own
name
his
news
was
astonishing
there
were
no
passengers
on
board
the
steam
dahabeah
she
had
arrived
with
none
save
her
crew
and
the
dragoman
now
talking
with
that
hadji
there
as
i
murmured
yes
and
no
and
indeed
really
to
the
officer
who
had
kindly
worked
on
our
behalf
i
was
saying
to
myself
my
duffer
what
an
ass
you
were
not
to
think
of
that
for
of
course
the
men
had
remained
at
abu
simbel
hiding
till
we
should
be
out
of
the
way
and
sending
their
boat
on
to
put
us
off
the
track
a
cook
steamer
and
a
boat
were
due
to
stop
at
the
temple
we
had
passed
both
on
the
river
by
this
time
the
two
men
were
doubtless
on
their
way
north
making
for
cairo
and
safety
still
here
was
bedr
looking
like
a
fat
fly
who
had
deliberately
come
to
pay
a
call
on
the
lean
and
hungry
spider
i
was
impatient
for
the
moment
when
the
need
for
genuine
gratitude
and
faked
explanations
was
over
and
major
ireton
had
gone
about
other
business
then
i
could
follow
the
hadji
and
the
armenian
who
had
mounted
the
steps
leading
up
from
to
the
town
not
far
off
i
could
see
the
desert
train
round
which
on
the
station
platform
buzzed
and
scolded
the
set
demanding
their
and
their
compartments
but
anthony
and
his
victim
or
was
it
by
chance
vice
versa
were
keeping
out
of
eyeshot
and
earshot
of
the
late
passengers
of
the
brigit
and
monny
who
must
have
seen
bedr
were
too
tactful
to
hover
near
also
they
knew
antoun
effendi
too
well
to
think
it
necessary
bedr
gave
me
no
time
to
speak
he
rushed
forward
to
greet
me
with
effusion
as
if
i
were
a
and
patron
i
bin
so
glad
see
you
again
after
these
days
milord
sure
he
began
antoun
effendi
he
tell
you
i
come
here
on
purpose
to
do
you
good
i
find
out
those
genlemens
very
wicked
men
so
i
leave
them
quick
they
want
to
pay
me
for
go
back
with
them
but
no
money
big
enough
now
i
know
they
try
to
do
harm
to
my
nice
young
lady
she
was
so
good
to
me
as
the
other
nice
young
lady
but
that
makes
no
matter
i
not
stand
for
any
hurt
to
her
sure
i
will
not
milord
the
meaning
of
this
rigmarole
anthony
cut
him
short
speaking
in
german
which
he
knew
i
understood
and
trusted
bedr
did
is
that
the
fellow
wants
us
to
buy
information
from
him
he
pretends
to
have
broken
with
his
employers
on
our
account
though
his
explanation
of
getting
here
to
halfa
on
their
dahabeah
is
ridiculous
and
that
having
come
for
our
benefit
against
their
wishes
he
without
pay
penniless
and
stranded
a
lie
of
course
i
took
for
granted
also
in
german
the
part
about
being
broke
certainly
but
it
certain
too
that
he
must
know
some
things
we
like
to
know
could
we
trust
a
word
he
says
no
as
far
as
his
moral
sense
is
concerned
but
my
idea
is
to
bargain
with
him
we
to
pay
according
to
value
received
that
might
be
bait
for
a
fish
worth
hooking
yes
that
our
line
we
have
much
time
to
hear
and
digest
his
story
though
the
train
will
start
in
less
than
an
hour
we
sha
waste
a
minute
without
waiting
for
you
i
began
to
bargain
on
the
line
i
just
suggested
how
far
did
you
get
a
good
way
for
i
was
able
to
scare
him
a
bit
you
see
he
earns
his
living
in
cairo
and
i
persuaded
him
that
i
have
some
influence
there
in
quarters
that
can
make
or
break
him
he
has
much
more
time
to
spare
than
we
have
if
it
true
that
he
wants
to
start
back
on
the
government
boat
you
know
they
take
natives
third
class
my
suggestion
subject
to
your
approval
is
this
in
any
case
we
give
a
thousand
piasters
ten
pounds
but
if
what
he
can
tell
us
is
of
real
use
or
even
interest
we
rise
to
the
extent
of
ten
times
that
sum
it
a
good
deal
for
a
beastly
baboon
like
him
remember
he
has
been
doing
services
lately
for
which
he
probably
got
high
pay
all
right
whatever
you
say
goes
i
agreed
i
trust
to
your
honours
my
genlemens
remarked
the
beastly
baboon
in
question
in
a
manner
so
apropos
that
i
guessed
him
not
entirely
ignorant
of
german
after
all
thanks
for
the
compliment
i
responded
gratefully
we
shall
have
to
talk
here
there
no
time
to
find
a
more
convenient
place
said
fenton
returning
to
arabic
as
a
medium
of
communication
fire
away
bedr
but
do
start
your
story
in
the
middle
begin
where
you
took
service
with
these
gentlemen
was
the
genlemens
irish
i
never
know
that
purred
the
guileless
bedr
but
fenton
brought
him
to
his
bearings
all
questions
were
to
be
from
us
to
him
so
bedr
fired
away
and
there
within
a
stone
throw
of
the
train
getting
up
steam
for
khartum
we
listened
to
a
strange
tale
as
strange
and
as
great
an
anachronism
as
that
dark
we
had
seen
except
in
the
nile
country
where
live
crocodiles
and
many
other
dark
things
can
easily
happen
any
day
blount
name
according
to
bedr
was
not
blount
but
something
else
in
america
it
was
a
name
already
associated
with
that
of
which
inclined
us
to
hope
for
some
grains
of
truth
in
the
chaff
of
lies
we
expected
bedr
said
that
in
new
york
years
ago
he
had
known
the
man
blount
he
was
related
to
the
american
family
who
took
bedr
from
cairo
later
when
the
armenians
had
returned
to
egypt
blount
had
come
with
him
for
a
rest
cure
he
had
engaged
bedr
as
dragoman
and
on
leaving
had
asked
for
bedr
card
that
was
years
ago
and
nothing
had
been
heard
from
him
since
but
before
the
was
due
to
arrive
bedr
had
received
a
telegram
from
blount
instructing
him
to
meet
the
ship
and
wire
to
paris
whether
miss
gilder
of
new
york
and
a
jones
were
on
board
with
a
party
blount
knew
that
bedr
had
seen
miss
gilder
as
a
child
and
might
now
be
able
to
recognize
her
on
the
day
in
new
york
when
a
block
in
traffic
had
given
a
glimpse
of
the
little
girl
in
a
with
her
father
bedr
and
blount
had
been
together
as
soon
as
possible
after
bedr
reply
blount
and
another
man
who
called
himself
hanna
had
arrived
in
cairo
bedr
knew
that
they
had
a
fixed
theory
in
regard
to
the
young
lady
who
passed
as
miss
gilder
who
they
supposed
her
to
be
he
could
not
tell
but
once
he
had
happened
to
be
near
when
they
were
not
aware
of
his
presence
and
had
heard
one
of
them
mention
a
woman
name
which
sounded
like
esny
they
accepted
his
word
that
he
had
been
able
to
identify
the
miss
guest
as
rosamond
gilder
and
in
her
they
appeared
to
take
no
further
interest
their
attention
was
concentrated
on
jones
and
on
the
lady
who
according
to
their
belief
was
but
posing
as
miss
gilder
apparently
they
imagined
her
to
be
quite
another
person
one
whom
they
had
taken
a
great
deal
of
trouble
to
reach
also
they
had
an
idea
that
jones
possessed
something
of
which
they
were
anxious
to
get
hold
it
was
a
thing
which
ought
to
be
theirs
and
they
had
been
after
it
for
years
but
she
had
contrived
to
hide
herself
and
it
until
lately
why
he
had
been
told
to
guide
the
two
younger
ladies
to
the
house
of
the
crocodile
bedr
pretended
not
to
know
perhaps
only
perhaps
blount
and
his
companion
hanna
wished
to
kidnap
the
one
we
called
miss
gilder
and
they
called
esney
but
good
kind
bedr
had
never
dreamed
that
they
meant
any
real
harm
there
had
been
a
plan
of
some
sort
for
that
night
blount
and
hanna
were
to
arrive
at
the
house
of
the
crocodile
for
a
close
look
at
the
young
ladies
when
the
latter
had
gone
to
sleep
under
the
influence
of
the
hasheesh
they
intended
to
smoke
but
the
two
gentlemen
had
not
kept
the
appointment
at
first
bedr
had
not
understood
why
and
had
not
known
what
to
do
afterward
of
course
when
he
had
heard
of
the
row
in
the
street
which
had
caused
the
closing
of
the
house
for
many
tedious
hours
he
had
guessed
and
later
when
he
learned
that
poor
blount
lay
wounded
in
a
hospital
it
had
all
become
clear
hanna
who
seemed
to
work
under
blount
orders
had
not
been
able
to
act
alone
then
as
to
all
the
travelling
up
the
nile
bedr
had
never
been
told
why
his
genlemen
made
the
journey
every
one
who
came
to
egypt
went
up
the
nile
only
he
had
been
instructed
to
find
out
always
where
we
were
and
told
to
arrange
their
arrival
at
about
the
same
time
at
medinet
they
had
not
camped
or
gone
to
an
hotel
but
had
stayed
in
the
house
of
a
friend
of
bedr
it
was
convenient
though
not
as
comfortable
as
he
could
wish
for
his
clients
the
advantage
was
that
from
the
roof
it
was
possible
to
see
into
our
camp
bedr
had
made
friends
with
one
of
the
who
went
to
market
to
buy
the
black
lamb
and
while
we
were
away
had
found
out
which
was
the
tent
where
jones
and
miss
gilder
or
esney
slept
what
happened
in
the
night
he
could
not
say
he
had
stayed
at
his
friend
house
while
the
two
gentlemen
went
out
he
had
done
nothing
at
all
for
them
in
medinet
except
to
discover
the
ladies
tent
and
also
to
buy
a
bottle
of
olive
oil
when
the
gentlemen
came
home
in
the
middle
of
the
night
they
were
angry
with
him
because
they
said
he
had
shown
them
the
wrong
tent
but
that
was
unjust
it
was
the
only
time
they
had
been
unkind
except
for
that
they
had
been
good
and
had
given
him
plenty
of
money
for
a
while
at
asiut
and
luxor
they
had
been
pleased
with
him
all
they
wanted
at
rechid
bey
house
was
to
get
the
thing
jones
had
which
ought
to
be
theirs
they
had
not
told
him
this
but
he
heard
them
talk
sometimes
he
knew
more
languages
than
they
thought
if
they
wanted
to
steal
the
young
lady
they
had
never
said
so
when
the
plan
failed
they
did
not
blame
bedr
it
was
not
his
fault
they
saw
that
the
had
been
engaged
as
long
ago
as
just
after
medinet
when
the
thing
the
gentlemen
wanted
to
do
there
could
not
be
done
but
bedr
thought
that
if
the
luxor
plan
had
been
a
success
the
steam
dahabeah
would
have
gone
north
from
there
instead
of
south
it
was
because
of
that
failure
the
boat
had
followed
us
up
the
nile
at
abu
simbel
bedr
had
quarrelled
with
the
gentlemen
because
he
began
to
suspect
they
meant
harm
to
the
ladies
or
to
one
of
them
he
had
been
clever
and
got
on
board
the
as
they
told
him
to
do
he
had
obtained
and
typed
a
copy
of
a
letter
in
america
he
had
learned
to
do
typing
often
he
could
make
better
money
in
an
engagement
now
because
he
knew
how
to
use
a
machine
and
when
the
steward
showed
him
over
the
boat
he
left
the
letter
in
the
stateroom
which
the
arab
boy
said
was
miss
gilder
in
spite
of
all
these
good
services
which
no
other
dragoman
in
egypt
could
have
given
those
gentlemen
would
not
listen
to
a
word
of
advice
bedr
heard
them
speak
with
the
guardian
of
the
temple
about
going
in
before
any
one
else
came
to
see
the
sunrise
and
afterward
they
talked
of
hiding
in
the
sanctuary
first
they
had
asked
him
if
it
were
always
dark
there
as
the
said
after
hearing
this
he
had
put
two
and
two
together
and
when
he
remembered
what
was
in
the
note
he
typed
for
miss
gilder
bedr
feared
for
her
and
jones
he
begged
the
gentlemen
not
to
do
anything
rash
and
they
were
so
angry
at
his
interference
that
they
sent
him
off
with
no
more
pay
nothing
at
all
since
luxor
oh
no
they
were
not
afraid
of
him
and
what
he
could
tell
because
they
said
nobody
would
believe
a
dragoman
word
against
rich
white
gentlemen
people
would
say
he
lied
for
spite
but
bedr
thought
maybe
we
should
believe
because
we
knew
already
that
something
strange
had
been
going
on
the
gentlemen
paid
off
the
men
on
the
and
ordered
her
to
go
on
to
wady
halfa
they
did
not
know
that
bedr
had
slipped
on
board
and
hidden
there
on
purpose
to
find
us
and
tell
his
story
a
part
of
this
tale
carried
truth
on
its
face
but
anthony
and
i
agreed
that
there
was
a
queer
discrepancy
at
the
end
if
bedr
spoke
the
truth
blount
and
his
comrade
must
have
had
a
reason
for
wishing
to
get
rid
of
the
fellow
or
for
not
caring
what
became
of
him
a
reason
unconnected
with
a
quarrel
and
it
was
certain
that
if
there
had
been
a
quarrel
it
was
not
because
of
virtuous
from
bedr
it
seemed
impossible
that
he
could
have
got
on
board
their
hired
boat
to
follow
us
without
his
employers
knowledge
was
his
appearance
at
wady
halfa
and
his
apparent
betrayal
of
his
clients
all
a
part
of
their
plan
we
could
not
decide
this
question
in
our
minds
or
by
bedr
while
the
train
waited
for
only
time
could
prove
but
what
we
had
heard
was
interesting
enough
to
be
worth
the
promised
thousand
piasters
and
the
fare
north
on
the
government
boat
just
starting
to
make
sure
that
bedr
did
start
we
called
kruger
put
the
whole
sum
into
his
hands
asking
him
to
help
the
dragoman
by
buying
his
ticket
and
getting
the
notes
changed
into
gold
and
silver
this
little
manoeuvre
left
the
armenian
so
calm
however
that
we
fancied
his
wish
must
really
be
to
depart
on
the
government
boat
such
inquiries
as
we
had
time
to
make
concerning
the
seemed
to
show
that
she
must
remain
at
halfa
for
slight
repairs
to
her
engine
and
instructions
from
her
owner
who
was
staying
at
assuan
it
was
just
at
the
last
minute
of
grace
with
the
adjuring
and
the
set
reproaching
us
that
anthony
and
i
jumped
on
board
the
train
strange
that
two
rows
of
blue
glass
windows
should
have
power
to
turn
the
whole
world
or
to
create
a
new
one
of
an
entirely
original
but
so
it
was
those
people
seated
in
their
grand
travelling
rooms
had
only
a
superficial
resemblance
to
the
passengers
of
the
monny
for
instance
had
pale
green
hair
with
immense
purple
eyes
and
showed
every
sign
of
rapid
transformation
into
a
mermaid
cleopatra
auburn
waves
had
turned
to
a
vivid
magenta
biddy
black
tresses
had
a
blue
grapey
bloom
on
them
and
anthony
dark
eyes
were
a
sinister
green
with
red
lights
ghostly
mother
o
pearl
faces
with
opal
shadows
peered
through
the
violet
glass
at
an
unreal
landscape
which
would
instantly
cease
to
exist
if
the
windows
were
opened
but
the
windows
could
not
be
opened
or
a
rain
of
sand
would
pour
in
so
we
gazed
out
on
an
impossible
fairy
land
consisting
of
golden
sea
with
mountainous
shores
carved
from
amethyst
through
which
shone
the
glow
of
pulsing
fires
always
we
carried
with
us
an
immense
shadow
like
a
trailing
purple
banner
unfurling
as
we
moved
men
and
women
and
animals
seen
at
the
numbered
white
stations
in
the
sand
were
but
fantastic
figures
in
a
camera
obscura
the
shadow
of
the
train
was
torn
with
fiery
streaks
and
when
the
sun
had
burned
to
death
on
a
red
the
moon
stole
out
to
mourn
for
him
her
coming
was
sudden
she
seemed
abruptly
to
draw
aside
a
hyacinth
curtain
and
hold
up
a
lamp
over
the
desert
when
the
sun
fire
had
died
and
the
lamp
gave
forth
an
unearthly
light
which
poured
over
the
endless
sands
a
sheet
of
flame
the
warm
was
chilled
from
purple
to
gray
and
flowed
over
the
magic
primrose
fields
like
a
river
of
molten
silver
at
number
six
station
where
we
stopped
for
water
after
dinner
a
hyena
came
galumping
over
the
sand
like
a
humpbacked
dog
to
stare
at
us
as
we
strolled
in
couples
away
from
the
train
into
the
desert
next
morning
every
one
was
up
early
to
see
the
gray
hornets
nest
huts
which
were
sudanese
villages
and
the
villagers
themselves
who
urged
us
to
buy
straw
rugs
baskets
fans
oranges
dried
beans
live
birds
and
milk
in
wooden
bowls
whenever
the
train
stopped
respectable
old
ladies
dressed
in
short
fringes
and
small
boys
dressed
in
nothing
at
all
i
had
not
told
biddy
about
our
bargain
with
sir
marcus
anthony
and
my
services
in
exchange
for
the
mountain
of
the
golden
pyramid
why
should
she
be
forced
to
share
our
suspense
for
she
would
share
it
if
she
knew
even
though
she
did
yet
yield
to
me
in
the
matter
of
a
united
future
i
wanted
to
wait
before
telling
her
the
story
until
fenton
and
i
had
made
sure
if
there
were
anything
golden
about
the
mountain
except
its
name
if
we
were
doomed
to
disappointment
i
could
then
give
the
tale
a
humorous
turn
easier
to
do
in
retrospect
than
anticipation
now
when
in
blinding
light
of
noon
we
pointed
out
in
an
impersonal
manner
to
all
who
cared
to
see
the
of
meröe
it
seemed
strange
to
think
that
no
heart
but
anthony
and
mine
beat
the
faster
the
sun
was
so
hot
that
most
people
blinking
dazedly
retired
behind
their
screens
of
blue
glass
almost
as
soon
as
the
train
stopped
close
to
garstang
camp
i
had
informed
the
set
casually
that
wonderful
things
were
being
found
here
in
the
rocky
desert
that
the
few
neat
white
tents
sheltered
men
who
were
going
to
make
of
meröe
a
world
wonder
that
not
only
had
the
army
of
stunted
black
pyramids
visible
from
the
train
yielded
up
treasures
but
three
tiers
of
palaces
were
being
unearthed
or
rather
unsanded
i
said
nothing
however
of
the
more
distant
dark
shapes
like
the
pyramids
yet
unlike
them
among
those
low
conical
mountains
which
perhaps
gave
inspiration
to
the
pyramid
builders
was
our
mountain
and
i
was
not
sorry
when
the
burning
sun
smote
curiosity
from
eyes
and
brains
and
sent
nearly
all
my
flock
back
to
their
places
while
the
train
had
still
some
minutes
at
the
station
cleopatra
had
not
come
out
she
had
frankly
lost
interest
in
scenic
history
and
did
not
want
to
be
intelligent
but
as
anthony
and
i
stepped
off
the
train
we
saw
that
brigit
and
monny
stood
arm
in
arm
in
the
doorway
would
you
like
to
jump
down
i
asked
reluctantly
for
the
first
time
i
did
not
wish
biddy
to
give
me
her
society
i
hoped
she
would
say
no
thank
you
for
i
wanted
fenton
to
point
out
our
mountain
which
he
had
told
me
could
be
seen
and
it
would
be
inconvenient
to
answer
questions
yes
we
should
like
it
they
both
replied
together
so
anthony
and
i
had
to
look
delighted
it
really
was
a
pleasure
to
help
them
down
but
even
that
we
could
have
waited
for
till
our
arrival
at
khartum
and
the
first
remark
that
biddy
made
was
too
intelligent
what
are
those
weird
things
off
there
in
the
distance
that
look
exactly
like
ruined
pyramids
sort
of
mudpie
pyramids
mountains
said
fenton
what
did
anybody
them
the
legend
is
that
djinns
or
evil
spirits
created
them
to
use
as
tombs
for
themselves
but
they
almost
precisely
like
the
made
pyramids
only
a
little
more
tumbledown
have
they
names
some
have
i
believe
anthony
returned
with
his
air
of
indifference
that
blackest
and
most
ruined
looking
one
of
all
for
instance
between
two
which
are
taller
there
away
to
the
left
i
mean
that
is
called
the
of
the
golden
pyramid
our
eyes
met
over
the
girls
veiled
hats
after
all
he
had
found
an
opportunity
of
telling
me
what
i
wanted
to
know
what
a
fascinating
name
said
monny
it
sounds
as
if
there
were
some
special
story
connected
with
it
is
there
ye
es
anthony
was
obliged
to
admit
there
is
a
legend
that
it
was
used
as
a
tomb
by
the
first
queen
candace
who
lived
about
two
hundred
years
after
ptolemy
philadelphus
she
used
to
reign
over
what
they
called
the
island
of
meröe
it
was
this
once
fertile
kingdom
between
the
atbara
river
over
there
and
the
blue
nile
they
say
she
wished
to
be
buried
with
all
her
jewels
and
treasure
and
was
afraid
of
her
tomb
being
robbed
so
she
would
trust
to
a
pyramid
she
ordered
a
secret
place
to
be
hollowed
out
in
the
heart
of
a
mountain
and
that
the
one
they
pretend
it
is
what
a
lovely
legend
but
i
suppose
there
nothing
in
it
really
or
clever
people
like
those
who
digging
here
now
would
have
found
the
tomb
and
the
treasure
long
ago
said
monny
i
do
know
i
left
anthony
to
answer
wondering
what
he
would
say
only
a
very
few
have
ever
put
enough
faith
in
the
story
to
search
and
they
have
never
been
able
to
discover
traces
of
an
entrance
into
that
mountain
or
any
other
of
course
in
trying
to
enter
the
great
pyramid
of
ghizeh
they
looked
a
long
time
before
they
succeeded
but
that
was
different
there
was
never
any
doubt
of
there
being
something
worth
seeing
inside
whereas
this
black
lump
may
be
solid
rock
and
nothing
more
it
many
years
since
anybody
has
tried
to
get
at
the
secret
i
beg
your
pardon
politely
said
in
french
an
elderly
man
in
a
pith
helmet
blue
spectacles
and
khaki
clothes
who
stood
near
i
could
help
hearing
your
conversation
and
it
may
interest
you
and
these
ladies
to
learn
that
at
this
very
moment
work
is
going
on
at
the
mountain
of
the
golden
pyramid
i
envied
anthony
the
brown
stain
on
his
face
for
i
felt
the
blood
rushing
to
mine
indeed
i
ejaculated
in
english
we
are
very
much
interested
work
actually
going
on
yes
it
was
begun
about
four
or
five
weeks
ago
by
an
agent
of
sir
marcus
lark
the
financier
who
got
the
concession
which
some
other
party
was
said
to
be
trying
for
i
am
here
went
on
the
helmeted
man
gazing
benevolently
through
his
blue
spectacles
at
the
two
pretty
women
i
am
here
with
my
son
who
is
one
of
garstang
men
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
mountain
of
the
golden
pyramid
luckily
for
sir
marcus
it
was
adjudged
to
be
off
our
still
we
are
interested
they
are
keeping
their
work
very
secret
but
these
things
are
in
the
air
the
talk
here
is
that
they
on
the
point
of
making
if
they
have
made
already
some
very
startling
discovery
all
aboard
you
please
shouted
the
greek
guard
chapter
xxix
exit
antoun
if
there
had
been
no
brigit
and
no
monny
in
the
world
we
should
have
let
that
train
go
on
without
us
and
hang
the
set
and
its
feelings
but
there
was
a
brigit
there
was
a
monny
and
they
were
more
to
us
than
all
the
treasure
sir
marcus
was
apparently
stealing
while
we
slaved
what
fools
we
had
been
to
trust
in
such
a
man
and
i
had
actually
wasted
pity
on
the
fellow
now
as
we
were
borne
away
from
meröe
we
saw
our
hopes
which
had
begun
to
seem
certainties
dissolving
into
air
they
were
like
the
mirage
of
the
desert
which
lured
us
with
siren
enchantment
and
mystery
in
this
which
thousands
of
brave
men
had
died
to
win
shimmering
blue
lakes
that
mirrored
green
trees
and
low
purple
mountains
and
the
gold
of
so
real
so
near
it
seemed
we
might
walk
to
them
in
a
few
moments
only
mocking
dreams
like
our
belief
in
a
famous
financier
loyalty
like
our
hopes
of
fortune
for
if
sir
marcus
lark
had
secretly
begun
work
at
the
mountain
of
the
golden
pyramid
it
meant
that
he
intended
to
steal
everything
best
worth
having
for
himself
it
was
maddening
to
realize
that
we
might
be
too
late
to
thwart
him
but
we
had
to
risk
this
or
risk
losing
something
dearer
than
the
jewels
of
a
queen
candace
anthony
was
staking
the
happiness
of
his
future
on
the
events
of
the
following
night
now
that
the
small
cloud
of
misunderstanding
had
passed
from
the
clear
sky
of
our
friendship
we
were
one
again
in
confidence
as
we
had
been
before
the
philae
eavesdropping
and
i
knew
the
plan
he
meant
to
carry
out
at
the
sirdar
ball
it
was
rather
a
melodramatic
plan
perhaps
but
somehow
it
fitted
into
the
circumstances
of
his
queer
courtship
and
i
could
see
why
anthony
preferred
it
to
any
other
more
conventional
as
for
me
i
too
counted
on
khartum
to
give
me
a
present
of
happiness
story
largely
false
as
it
might
be
must
have
a
basis
of
truth
ceased
to
argue
with
biddy
we
leave
the
subject
of
the
future
alone
till
we
get
to
khartum
i
had
said
she
thought
maybe
that
she
had
half
convinced
me
of
her
worldly
wisdom
but
this
was
far
from
being
the
case
i
was
only
waiting
to
see
whether
my
theory
were
right
or
wrong
i
could
know
until
khartum
and
nothing
on
earth
or
hidden
under
earth
would
have
induced
me
to
put
off
the
moment
of
finding
out
north
khartum
was
standing
in
a
mirage
as
we
approached
and
fenton
and
i
were
superstitious
enough
to
wonder
if
it
were
a
bad
omen
that
lovely
lake
which
was
not
there
reflecting
clearly
each
white
and
house
of
the
city
in
the
sand
only
the
blue
glitter
of
the
nile
was
real
as
the
train
crossed
the
river
on
a
high
bridge
and
landed
us
in
the
surprising
garden
of
beauty
which
is
khartum
itself
wide
streets
bordered
with
flowering
trees
acacias
and
coral
pendants
of
lawns
green
as
velvet
big
verandaed
houses
of
or
ruddy
stone
roses
climbing
over
hedge
and
wall
scent
of
lilies
and
magnolias
floating
in
an
air
clear
as
crystal
droning
sakkeyehs
spraying
pearls
over
the
warm
bodies
of
oxen
white
sails
like
butterflies
wings
dotting
the
blue
nile
this
was
the
new
city
created
as
if
by
magic
in
sixteen
years
upon
the
sad
ruins
of
gordon
stronghold
on
the
wide
veranda
of
the
grand
hotel
where
pretty
girls
were
giving
tea
to
young
officers
in
khaki
fenton
came
up
to
brigit
and
monny
who
were
questioning
me
about
letters
the
look
on
his
face
struck
the
girl
into
silence
what
is
it
she
asked
almost
sharply
do
let
me
interrupt
you
he
said
i
can
wait
a
few
minutes
no
monny
insisted
please
speak
i
know
it
something
important
important
only
to
myself
perhaps
he
answered
with
a
smile
that
was
rather
wistful
i
have
to
say
now
echoed
monny
surprised
and
even
frightened
more
by
his
look
and
tone
than
the
words
themselves
my
engagement
with
sir
marcus
lark
ended
when
our
train
stopped
at
khartum
i
have
other
business
to
attend
to
here
i
just
made
my
adieux
with
everybody
else
i
saved
you
till
the
last
monny
was
pale
even
the
fresh
young
rose
that
was
her
mouth
had
blanched
otherwise
she
controlled
herself
perfectly
was
this
part
of
anthony
plan
i
wondered
he
had
told
me
what
he
intended
to
do
at
the
palace
ball
night
but
he
had
said
nothing
about
this
preliminary
scene
i
understood
however
why
he
had
not
manoeuvred
to
get
monny
to
himself
in
a
deserted
corner
of
this
big
balcony
of
the
hotel
even
when
with
the
set
it
was
a
question
of
getting
their
tea
or
looking
at
their
rooms
eyes
were
always
ready
to
observe
miss
gilder
especially
since
it
was
in
the
air
that
she
really
miss
gilder
miss
gilder
he
did
not
want
miss
and
harlow
to
be
saying
look
my
dear
at
the
tragic
private
farewell
antoun
effendi
and
our
american
beauty
are
having
since
philae
there
would
have
been
no
use
in
trying
to
conceal
his
feelings
for
monny
from
brigit
or
me
therefore
we
made
useful
chaperons
and
could
be
regarded
as
dummies
you
never
told
me
you
were
leaving
us
at
khartum
the
girl
stammered
i
thought
but
though
we
knew
what
she
thought
she
could
go
no
further
before
an
audience
my
business
prevents
me
from
staying
at
the
hotel
anthony
explained
and
though
i
shall
see
you
never
again
will
you
see
poor
ahmed
antoun
i
do
understand
monny
said
i
know
but
that
was
what
we
agreed
upon
you
promised
to
trust
me
without
understanding
night
at
the
sirdar
ball
you
will
understand
i
arranged
with
lord
ernest
that
you
and
jones
and
east
and
he
shall
write
your
names
in
the
book
at
the
palace
then
you
will
all
receive
invitations
for
the
ball
you
four
only
of
the
party
and
you
will
be
there
i
just
told
you
anthony
repeated
that
antoun
is
saying
to
you
forever
yet
you
told
me
too
that
after
khartum
i
should
be
hap
she
cut
herself
short
and
shut
her
lips
closely
i
was
angry
with
fenton
for
what
seemed
cruelty
to
one
who
had
very
nobly
confessed
her
love
for
him
biddy
eyes
protested
too
but
the
man
and
the
girl
cared
no
more
for
us
or
our
criticism
at
that
moment
than
if
we
had
been
harmless
necessary
chairs
for
them
to
sit
upon
there
are
many
paths
to
happiness
fenton
answered
i
shall
see
you
night
and
i
shall
know
whether
you
are
happy
meanwhile
i
say
again
trust
me
and
he
held
out
his
strong
nervous
hand
so
browned
by
the
sun
that
it
needed
little
staining
for
the
part
he
had
played
and
was
to
play
no
more
as
if
mechanically
monny
gilder
laid
her
hand
in
it
they
looked
into
each
other
eyes
which
were
almost
on
a
level
so
tall
was
she
then
antoun
effendi
turned
abruptly
away
forgetting
apparently
that
he
had
not
taken
leave
of
brigit
or
me
let
go
upstairs
at
once
dear
and
see
our
rooms
biddy
said
quickly
an
instant
later
i
stood
alone
on
the
veranda
but
i
knew
well
enough
where
to
find
captain
anthony
fenton
when
i
wanted
him
although
the
death
knell
of
antoun
was
sounding
i
was
not
in
the
least
melancholy
and
despite
the
tense
emotion
of
that
short
scene
i
had
never
felt
less
sentimental
in
my
life
my
whole
being
concentrated
itself
in
a
desire
to
visit
the
and
to
bash
sir
marcus
lark
head
when
anthony
came
up
for
his
farewell
i
had
been
asking
brigit
and
monny
if
they
expected
letters
at
the
poste
restante
both
said
no
but
advised
by
me
they
gave
me
their
cards
armed
with
which
i
could
ask
for
letters
and
obtain
them
if
there
were
any
it
very
unlikely
any
one
will
address
me
there
biddy
had
assured
me
the
only
letter
hoping
for
will
come
to
the
hotel
i
was
not
jealous
because
i
was
sure
the
said
letter
was
from
esmé
now
for
weal
or
woe
halloran
the
letter
i
hoped
for
would
be
from
a
very
different
person
though
if
it
materialized
it
would
certainly
mention
the
runaway
bride
and
if
such
a
letter
came
to
khartum
the
place
to
look
for
it
i
thought
would
be
the
poste
restante
the
writer
not
being
a
personal
friend
of
and
presumably
not
knowing
khartum
could
not
be
certain
at
which
hotel
she
would
stop
i
was
hurrying
away
a
few
minutes
later
to
prove
once
and
for
all
whether
i
were
a
budding
sherlock
holmes
or
merely
an
imaginative
fool
when
a
servant
came
out
from
the
hotel
and
handed
me
a
telegram
i
read
the
signature
at
the
end
with
a
snort
of
rage
i
wonder
he
has
the
cheek
to
but
by
that
time
i
was
getting
at
the
meat
of
the
message
what
the
dev
by
jove
here
a
complication
i
heard
myself
mutter
a
running
accompaniment
to
marcus
lark
words
this
is
what
he
had
to
say
on
two
sheets
of
paper
lord
ernest
borrow
grand
hotel
khartum
in
train
leaving
assuan
met
man
from
meröe
told
me
work
begun
at
our
place
strange
news
do
understand
but
sure
you
two
have
gone
ahead
of
bargain
must
be
foul
play
or
else
mistake
but
thought
matter
too
serious
go
on
north
left
train
returned
assuan
caught
government
steamer
for
halfa
just
arrived
too
late
for
train
de
luxe
but
will
proceed
by
ordinary
train
to
camp
better
meet
me
there
soon
as
possible
leaving
boat
people
take
care
of
themselves
wire
kabushîa
lark
his
loyalty
to
us
shamed
me
we
had
not
given
him
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
but
had
at
once
believed
the
worst
he
though
not
a
gentleman
in
the
opinion
of
colonel
corkran
and
some
others
was
chivalrously
sure
that
we
had
not
gone
ahead
of
the
bargain
a
revulsion
of
feeling
gave
me
a
spasm
of
something
like
affection
for
the
big
fellow
whom
his
adored
cleopatra
sneered
at
as
common
i
longed
to
show
the
telegram
to
anthony
but
he
would
now
be
at
the
palace
reporting
to
the
sirdar
later
he
would
be
at
his
own
quarters
transforming
himself
from
a
pale
brown
hadji
in
a
green
turban
into
a
sunburned
young
british
officer
in
uniform
meantime
i
would
go
to
the
poste
restante
and
then
whatever
the
result
of
the
visit
i
would
return
collect
brigit
and
monny
and
take
them
to
the
palace
to
write
their
names
in
the
book
i
dare
not
think
what
my
blood
pressure
must
have
been
as
i
waited
for
a
official
to
look
through
a
bundle
of
letters
jones
he
murmured
no
nothing
for
jones
unless
jones
here
a
letter
addressed
to
jones
that
it
said
i
swallowing
heavily
jones
i
think
the
letter
must
be
postmarked
assuan
without
further
hesitation
the
man
handed
me
the
envelope
on
the
strength
of
jones
visiting
card
going
out
of
the
office
i
walked
on
air
sherlock
holmes
it
is
i
congratulated
myself
and
i
ventured
to
be
wildly
happy
because
it
seemed
to
me
that
a
letter
sent
to
jones
from
assuan
could
mean
only
one
thing
a
justification
of
my
theory
i
went
straight
to
biddy
door
and
knocked
there
was
no
answer
and
i
stood
fuming
with
impatience
on
the
upstairs
balcony
upon
which
each
bedroom
opens
it
seemed
impossible
to
live
another
minute
without
putting
that
letter
into
biddy
hand
and
not
for
the
world
would
i
have
let
it
come
to
her
from
any
one
else
i
was
tempted
to
tear
open
the
envelope
but
before
i
had
time
to
test
my
character
biddy
appeared
on
the
balcony
coming
round
the
corner
from
monny
room
why
duffer
you
look
as
if
the
sky
had
fallen
she
exclaimed
it
has
i
returned
it
lying
all
over
the
place
there
a
bit
of
it
in
this
letter
a
bit
of
heaven
maybe
a
letter
for
me
yes
and
if
you
are
quick
about
opening
it
i
commit
hari
kari
she
was
quick
about
opening
it
as
she
read
almost
literally
my
eyes
were
glued
to
her
face
it
went
white
then
pink
thank
heaven
i
said
within
myself
if
she
had
been
pink
first
and
white
afterward
i
should
have
been
alarmed
for
a
woman
colour
to
blossom
warmly
from
a
snowfield
means
good
news
duffer
she
breathed
do
you
know
what
in
this
i
thought
it
would
come
my
voice
sounded
rather
queer
i
fancied
i
had
more
that
why
i
wanted
your
card
for
the
poste
restante
read
this
she
said
and
gave
me
the
open
letter
it
was
written
on
paper
of
a
hotel
at
assuan
near
the
railway
station
and
was
as
follows
madam
let
me
explain
frankly
before
i
go
further
that
my
name
is
thomas
macmahan
you
may
remember
it
if
you
do
you
will
not
think
it
strange
that
i
as
a
private
person
as
well
as
a
member
of
a
society
whose
name
it
is
not
necessary
to
mention
wanted
certain
papers
you
were
supposed
to
possess
for
a
long
time
i
and
others
almost
equally
interested
tried
to
trace
you
after
learning
that
you
had
the
documents
or
in
any
case
knew
where
they
were
naturally
we
were
prepared
to
go
far
in
order
to
make
you
give
them
up
we
believed
that
your
was
with
you
as
the
need
was
pressing
and
we
had
failed
more
than
once
we
would
if
necessary
have
worked
upon
your
feelings
through
her
had
we
questioned
you
and
you
had
replied
that
we
were
mistaken
concerning
the
young
lady
and
the
papers
we
should
have
been
incredulous
but
accident
enabled
us
to
hear
from
your
own
lips
details
which
we
could
not
disbelieve
as
a
woman
we
wish
you
no
harm
therefore
we
rejoice
in
this
turn
of
events
for
your
sake
your
must
now
be
of
through
her
husband
she
has
nothing
further
to
fear
much
as
we
regret
her
marriage
into
a
family
so
deeply
injured
by
her
father
as
for
you
madam
you
may
be
at
rest
where
we
are
concerned
you
said
to
lord
ernest
borrow
in
the
temple
of
abu
simbel
that
you
could
never
be
happy
until
the
organization
richard
betrayed
forgot
and
forgave
his
daughter
and
yourself
through
me
the
organisation
now
formally
both
forgets
and
forgives
wishing
you
well
in
future
yours
truly
macmahan
alias
blount
kindly
acknowledge
receipt
of
this
letter
in
care
of
bedr
el
gemály
whose
address
you
have
at
cairo
not
hearing
from
you
we
shall
try
to
communicate
this
news
in
some
other
way
the
present
method
has
occurred
to
us
as
you
may
find
it
useful
to
know
the
state
of
affairs
without
delay
oh
biddy
you
find
it
useful
i
asked
she
held
out
her
hands
to
me
there
was
no
one
on
the
veranda
just
then
and
i
kissed
her
mine
i
said
what
a
gorgeous
place
khartum
would
be
to
be
married
in
monny
was
very
brave
next
day
she
went
to
omdurman
with
the
rest
of
us
and
it
was
the
chance
of
a
lifetime
because
through
anthony
slatin
pasha
himself
took
us
to
the
place
of
his
captivity
slatin
pasha
slim
soldierly
young
vital
and
brilliant
it
was
scarcely
possible
to
believe
that
this
man
who
looked
no
more
than
and
radiated
energy
could
have
passed
eleven
years
in
slavery
terrible
beyond
description
he
spoke
of
those
experiences
almost
lightly
as
if
telling
the
story
of
some
one
else
and
it
was
all
in
the
day
work
that
he
should
have
triumphed
over
his
persecutors
in
a
way
more
complete
more
dramatic
than
any
author
of
romance
would
dare
invent
for
his
hero
he
took
us
from
the
in
front
of
his
own
big
verandaed
house
down
the
blue
nile
in
a
fast
steam
launch
it
was
a
nile
as
blue
as
turquoise
and
after
the
low
island
of
tuli
had
been
left
behind
it
was
strange
to
see
the
junction
of
the
blue
and
the
white
niles
in
a
quarrelsome
swirl
of
sharply
divided
colours
landing
on
the
shore
at
omdurman
we
met
carts
loaded
with
and
wagons
piled
with
hides
giant
men
like
ebony
statues
walked
beside
pacing
camels
white
as
milk
the
vegetable
market
was
a
town
of
little
booths
the
grain
markets
had
gathered
riches
of
green
and
farther
on
in
the
brown
shadows
of
the
roughly
roofed
labyrinth
of
bazaars
were
stores
of
sandalwood
and
spices
smelling
like
araby
the
blest
shops
showing
splendid
leopard
skins
crocodile
heads
bristling
with
knives
carved
tusks
of
elephants
shields
armour
said
to
have
been
captured
from
crusaders
abyssinian
spears
swords
and
strange
headgear
used
by
the
mahdi
and
khalifa
men
the
bazaars
of
cairo
and
even
assuan
seemed
tame
and
sophisticated
compared
to
this
wild
market
of
the
sudan
where
half
the
men
and
all
the
women
who
were
old
enough
had
been
the
khalifa
slaves
with
slatin
pasha
we
went
to
the
khalifa
palace
to
gaze
at
the
saint
carriage
the
skeleton
of
gordon
piano
and
scores
of
ancient
guns
which
had
cut
short
the
lives
of
christian
men
house
we
saw
too
and
the
gate
whence
he
had
escaped
the
shattered
tomb
and
the
famous
mosque
then
we
had
a
run
up
the
blue
nile
as
far
as
gordon
tree
and
lunched
on
board
the
launch
in
the
afternoon
back
at
khartum
again
there
was
still
time
to
group
round
the
statue
of
gordon
on
his
camel
holding
the
short
stick
that
was
his
only
weapon
and
gazing
over
the
desert
the
set
were
allowed
to
walk
through
the
palace
gardens
to
behold
the
spot
at
the
head
of
the
grand
staircase
where
gordon
fell
and
to
have
a
glimpse
in
the
sirdar
library
of
the
photograph
taken
after
death
this
was
a
special
favour
and
as
they
knew
nothing
about
the
four
invitations
to
the
ball
they
were
satisfied
with
their
day
dinner
was
in
the
illuminated
garden
of
the
hotel
and
when
it
was
over
i
smuggled
brigit
and
monny
and
cleopatra
inconspicuously
away
no
one
suspected
and
if
the
lovely
dresses
worn
by
east
and
miss
gilder
were
commented
upon
doubtless
aunt
and
niece
were
merely
supposed
to
be
showing
off
never
i
think
had
monny
come
so
near
to
being
a
great
beauty
in
her
dress
of
softly
folding
silver
cloth
she
was
a
tall
white
lily
she
wore
no
jewels
except
a
string
of
pearls
and
there
was
no
colour
about
her
anywhere
except
the
deep
violet
her
hazel
eyes
took
on
at
night
and
the
of
her
hair
even
her
lips
were
pale
as
they
had
been
when
antoun
bade
her
hers
was
no
gay
dancing
mood
she
was
going
to
the
ball
because
antoun
effendi
had
ordered
rather
than
asked
her
to
go
but
she
was
like
some
fair
tragic
creature
on
trial
for
her
life
waiting
to
hear
what
the
verdict
of
the
jury
might
be
chapter
xxx
the
sirdar
ball
biddy
radiating
joy
walked
beside
me
with
eager
eyes
taking
in
every
detail
of
the
historic
house
she
admired
the
immense
hall
whose
archways
opened
into
dim
fragrant
gardens
she
was
entranced
with
the
sudanese
band
giants
uniformed
in
white
playing
wild
native
music
in
the
moonlight
she
wanted
to
stop
and
make
friends
with
the
shoebill
a
apparently
carved
in
shining
metal
with
a
bill
like
an
enormous
slipper
eyes
like
the
stop
in
a
kodak
and
feet
that
tested
each
new
tuft
of
grass
on
the
lawn
as
if
it
were
a
specimen
of
some
hitherto
undiscovered
thing
no
question
but
she
was
happy
i
was
proud
of
her
and
proud
of
myself
because
my
love
had
power
to
give
her
happiness
what
matter
now
if
i
were
being
robbed
at
the
mountain
of
the
golden
pyramid
by
some
unknown
thief
neither
he
nor
any
one
could
steal
biddy
even
cleopatra
seemed
pleased
to
be
coming
to
the
sirdar
ball
though
gloom
lay
heavy
upon
her
she
wanted
to
look
her
best
she
wanted
to
be
admired
by
the
officers
she
was
to
meet
and
to
have
as
many
partners
as
she
could
split
dances
for
to
be
admired
by
some
one
was
essential
to
her
just
now
a
soothing
medicine
to
heal
the
smart
of
hurt
vanity
monny
i
felt
had
made
herself
look
beautiful
only
because
she
thought
that
antoun
unseen
would
see
her
as
we
entered
the
ballroom
her
eyes
were
wistful
searching
yet
not
expecting
to
find
he
had
said
that
she
would
never
see
antoun
again
i
found
friends
in
the
ballroom
men
i
knew
at
home
and
a
few
pretty
women
i
had
met
in
england
or
abroad
but
there
was
no
more
than
time
to
be
received
by
the
and
to
introduce
a
few
officers
to
my
three
ladies
when
the
moment
came
for
the
formal
entry
of
our
host
and
hostess
the
and
his
graceful
wife
the
royalties
of
the
sudan
we
were
presented
and
i
guessed
at
once
that
the
sirdar
had
been
prepared
in
advance
to
take
a
special
interest
in
rosamond
gilder
anthony
has
told
him
the
whole
thing
and
asked
his
help
was
my
thought
from
the
instant
of
his
kindly
greeting
for
the
girl
i
found
myself
suddenly
excitedly
assuming
the
attitude
of
a
spectator
in
a
theatre
on
the
night
of
a
new
play
i
knew
the
plot
of
the
play
but
not
how
it
would
be
presented
nor
how
it
would
work
out
i
saw
that
the
sirdar
had
made
up
his
mind
to
a
certain
line
of
action
where
monny
was
concerned
and
by
and
by
when
he
had
time
to
spare
from
his
general
duties
as
host
i
heard
him
ask
if
she
would
like
to
go
on
the
roof
where
gordon
used
to
stand
watching
for
the
english
soldiers
to
come
i
will
take
you
he
said
and
if
you
like
to
stay
longer
than
i
can
stop
away
from
our
guests
i
give
you
another
guide
he
turned
to
biddy
and
me
cleopatra
was
dancing
with
baron
rudolph
von
slatin
pasha
gorgeous
in
medals
and
stars
brigit
and
i
had
just
stopped
would
you
like
to
come
too
the
sirdar
asked
i
answered
for
biddy
knowing
what
she
would
want
me
to
say
and
still
the
sense
of
being
a
spectator
in
a
wonderful
theatre
was
dreamily
upon
me
stronger
and
stronger
the
impression
grew
as
the
sirdar
led
us
out
onto
a
wide
loggia
white
with
moonlight
and
up
a
flight
of
stairs
to
a
flat
roof
overhead
a
sky
of
milk
was
spangled
with
flashing
stars
beneath
our
eyes
lay
the
palace
gardens
where
the
torches
of
the
sudanese
band
glowed
like
transfixed
fireflies
in
the
pale
palms
and
acacias
and
jewelled
were
cut
out
sharply
in
vivid
colour
by
the
lights
which
streamed
from
open
windows
beyond
past
the
zone
of
violet
shadow
so
like
a
stage
background
was
the
sheen
of
the
river
bright
as
spilt
mercury
under
the
moon
and
beyond
again
on
the
other
side
of
the
nile
the
tawny
flame
of
that
desert
across
which
came
the
khalifa
fierce
army
this
is
where
gordon
used
to
stand
the
sirdar
stopped
us
near
the
parapet
only
the
roof
was
one
story
lower
then
he
climbed
up
here
every
day
till
the
last
to
look
out
across
the
desert
saying
english
come
there
a
black
gardener
i
have
who
thinks
he
meets
him
now
on
moonlight
nights
like
this
walking
in
the
garden
it
was
much
of
a
garden
in
his
day
only
palms
and
orange
trees
but
a
he
planted
and
loved
is
alive
still
i
just
asked
one
of
my
officers
one
whom
i
particularly
want
you
to
meet
miss
gilder
to
pluck
a
rose
from
gordon
bush
and
bring
it
to
you
here
he
knows
where
to
find
us
and
when
he
comes
i
must
go
back
to
the
ballroom
and
leave
you
all
three
to
his
guidance
lord
ernest
and
he
used
to
be
friends
as
boys
i
believe
perhaps
you
heard
him
speak
of
captain
anthony
fenton
perhaps
i
do
remember
monny
answered
apologetically
she
so
and
was
charmingly
shy
with
this
great
soldier
who
had
made
history
in
the
sudan
if
you
do
remember
lord
ernest
ca
have
done
justice
to
the
subject
fenton
one
of
the
finest
young
officers
in
egypt
or
indeed
in
the
service
we
rather
proud
of
him
lately
he
been
employed
on
a
special
mission
which
he
has
carried
out
extremely
well
few
others
could
have
done
it
for
a
man
of
great
audacity
and
was
needed
a
combination
hard
to
find
he
has
been
in
the
balkans
and
since
has
had
a
particularly
delicate
task
intrusted
to
him
to
be
conducted
with
absolute
secrecy
no
to
be
got
out
of
it
in
case
of
success
and
failure
would
almost
certainly
have
cost
his
life
it
was
a
question
of
disguise
and
getting
at
the
native
heart
it
sounds
like
something
in
a
story
book
said
monny
while
brigit
and
i
kept
mum
drinking
in
gulps
of
moonlight
yes
the
sirdar
agreed
or
the
autobiography
of
sir
richard
burton
fenton
has
the
same
extraordinary
gift
of
language
and
dialect
that
burton
had
the
art
of
too
and
he
been
to
mecca
a
great
adventure
i
believe
he
had
perhaps
you
can
get
him
to
talk
of
it
though
he
not
fond
of
talking
about
himself
altogether
he
what
i
sometimes
hear
the
ladies
call
romantic
figure
his
father
was
a
famous
soldier
if
you
were
english
you
would
have
heard
of
him
he
broke
off
a
brilliant
career
in
egypt
by
running
away
with
a
beautiful
princess
she
was
practically
all
greek
and
italian
though
her
father
called
himself
a
turk
no
egyptian
blood
whatever
but
there
was
a
great
row
of
course
and
charles
fenton
left
the
army
now
anthony
fenton
grandfather
who
lives
in
constantinople
would
like
to
adopt
his
grandson
but
the
young
man
is
in
every
sense
of
the
word
an
englishman
devoted
to
his
career
and
does
want
a
fortune
or
a
turkish
title
why
that
sounds
monny
faltered
like
a
man
of
character
and
a
born
soldier
does
it
here
he
comes
now
there
was
a
sound
of
quick
light
footsteps
on
the
stairs
in
silence
we
turned
to
see
a
tall
young
officer
in
uniform
walk
out
upon
the
flat
roof
the
moon
shone
straight
into
a
face
grave
yet
eager
so
deeply
sunburned
as
to
be
brown
even
in
that
pale
light
long
eyebrows
sketched
sharply
as
if
in
ink
the
black
lines
running
down
toward
the
temples
large
sad
eyes
a
slight
upward
hitch
of
the
mouth
on
one
side
clear
cut
roman
nose
aggressive
chin
miss
gilder
let
me
introduce
captain
anthony
fenton
the
sirdar
said
i
brought
you
a
rose
said
anthony
they
stood
looking
at
one
another
for
a
long
moment
the
british
officer
and
the
pale
girl
we
biddy
and
i
stared
at
them
both
from
our
distance
and
when
the
spell
of
the
instant
had
broken
we
saw
that
the
sirdar
had
gone
we
too
would
have
gone
though
the
man
and
the
girl
were
between
us
and
the
stairway
and
we
should
have
had
to
push
past
them
but
anthony
seeing
our
hesitation
spoke
quietly
do
go
he
said
i
may
want
you
never
until
had
monny
gilder
heard
him
speak
english
you
see
he
said
to
her
why
i
told
you
yesterday
you
would
never
see
antoun
again
i
had
to
tell
you
that
to
make
sure
you
would
trust
me
fully
through
everything
you
trusted
me
and
so
made
it
possible
for
me
to
keep
my
vow
a
wrong
and
stupid
vow
but
it
had
to
be
kept
when
i
was
angry
because
you
treated
me
like
a
servant
i
swore
that
never
no
matter
how
i
might
be
tempted
would
i
tell
you
with
my
own
lips
who
i
was
or
let
borrow
tell
i
was
going
to
make
myself
of
importance
in
your
life
as
ahmed
antoun
if
i
could
not
as
anthony
fenton
but
long
before
that
night
at
philae
i
was
ashamed
i
but
you
said
then
you
would
forgive
me
now
when
you
understand
what
you
did
understand
then
can
you
still
say
the
same
i
hardly
know
what
to
say
she
answered
i
do
know
how
i
feel
about
anything
well
i
know
you
goose
exclaimed
biddy
rushing
to
the
rescue
where
angels
who
have
learned
to
think
with
their
hearts
might
have
feared
to
tread
you
feel
so
happy
you
afraid
you
going
to
howl
why
it
all
perfectly
wonderful
and
only
the
silliest
earliest
victorian
girls
would
sulk
because
they
been
if
anybody
deceived
you
you
deceived
knew
who
he
was
from
the
first
so
did
your
aunt
clara
we
kept
our
ears
open
and
heard
the
duffer
talk
about
his
friend
anthony
fenton
who
was
coming
to
meet
us
were
mooning
i
suppose
and
did
listen
we
did
give
him
away
partly
because
it
was
our
business
and
partly
because
each
of
us
was
up
to
another
game
never
mind
what
captain
fenton
never
tried
to
play
you
a
trick
you
threw
yourself
at
his
head
you
know
you
did
from
shepheard
terrace
he
had
his
to
think
of
and
be
conceited
if
you
thought
he
ought
to
have
let
you
interfere
with
it
as
it
happened
you
worked
in
quite
well
with
the
mission
at
first
then
fate
stepped
in
and
made
the
band
play
a
different
dance
tune
no
military
march
but
a
that
was
his
fault
and
i
have
to
remind
you
of
all
this
because
you
glaring
at
captain
fenton
now
as
if
he
done
something
wrong
instead
of
fine
and
he
ca
praise
himself
as
she
finished
out
of
breath
having
dashed
on
without
a
single
comma
the
giant
black
musicians
in
the
garden
began
to
sing
a
strange
african
love
song
in
deep
rich
voices
their
instruments
which
had
played
with
precision
european
airs
suddenly
pouring
out
their
primitive
passionate
souls
biddy
dear
said
the
girl
in
a
small
meek
voice
thank
you
very
much
and
you
just
sweet
but
i
need
even
you
to
defend
him
to
me
i
was
only
just
stopping
to
breathe
for
fear
my
heart
would
burst
because
i
was
with
too
much
joy
i
him
and
and
you
can
both
go
away
now
please
we
do
want
you
we
went
biddy
would
have
fallen
downstairs
if
i
had
caught
her
round
the
waist
needless
to
say
i
did
look
back
but
biddy
did
and
should
by
rights
have
been
turned
into
a
pillar
of
salt
my
gracious
but
they
beautiful
she
gasped
for
goodness
sake
let
dash
as
fast
as
we
can
down
into
the
garden
and
do
the
same
thing
what
i
floundered
why
you
kiss
each
other
like
mad
boiling
with
excitement
when
i
met
cleopatra
later
in
the
ballroom
i
told
her
what
was
going
on
above
in
the
moonlight
on
the
roof
at
last
your
niece
knows
what
i
think
you
have
guessed
all
along
but
so
wisely
kept
to
yourself
i
said
about
fenton
i
mean
it
all
right
between
those
two
now
they
will
come
downstairs
engaged
everybody
is
engaged
cleopatra
stormily
retorted
that
exactly
what
i
remarked
to
brigit
before
i
could
persuade
her
to
follow
the
general
example
in
the
world
is
engaged
except
ourselves
are
the
words
i
used
and
except
me
added
east
you
forgot
me
did
you
never
i
insisted
you
could
be
engaged
to
a
dozen
men
any
moment
if
you
wanted
to
i
think
you
exaggerating
a
little
lord
ernest
cleopatra
replied
modestly
and
unsmilingly
but
her
countenance
brightened
faintly
of
course
there
are
a
few
men
there
were
some
in
new
york
you
do
need
to
tell
me
that
i
assured
her
i
feel
as
if
i
like
to
tell
you
something
else
she
went
on
if
you
can
spare
a
few
minutes
will
you
sit
out
the
next
dance
i
asked
it
is
a
bunny
hug
or
tango
or
anything
distracting
for
are
you
dancing
with
brigit
no
such
luck
i
mean
fortunately
not
she
has
grabbed
slatin
pasha
and
forgotten
that
i
exist
by
jove
there
come
miss
gilder
and
fenton
what
a
couple
they
rather
gorgeous
waltzing
together
what
very
nice
said
cleopatra
trying
with
all
her
heart
not
to
be
acid
but
oh
lord
ernest
that
it
i
be
engaged
myself
monny
brings
him
to
show
me
like
a
cat
with
a
mouse
it
caught
otherwise
i
could
it
and
afterward
would
be
too
late
hastily
i
rushed
her
out
into
the
garden
where
the
shoebill
regarded
her
with
one
eye
of
prehistoric
wisdom
if
she
really
were
a
reincarnation
i
sure
he
knew
it
and
had
probably
belonged
to
her
in
alexandria
when
she
was
queen
there
a
talmadge
in
new
york
she
went
on
wildly
he
said
he
would
come
to
me
from
across
the
world
at
a
moment
notice
if
i
wired
only
it
would
be
awkward
if
i
announced
our
engagement
and
then
found
he
changed
his
mind
besides
he
be
a
resort
and
sayda
sabri
said
i
ought
why
not
wire
i
ventured
if
his
telegram
had
not
come
yesterday
i
would
as
soon
have
advised
cleopatra
to
adopt
an
asp
oh
well
i
thinking
of
it
that
one
thing
i
wanted
to
ask
your
advice
about
i
believe
he
does
love
me
idolizes
is
the
word
and
now
and
then
in
the
night
i
had
a
feeling
it
was
almost
like
wasting
something
to
refuse
a
marcus
antonius
sayda
sabri
warned
me
to
wait
for
a
man
named
antony
whom
i
should
meet
in
egypt
that
why
i
but
no
matter
now
the
is
a
dreadful
obstacle
though
how
could
i
live
with
a
lark
lady
lark
has
quite
a
musical
lilt
do
you
think
so
there
one
thing
even
if
you
the
wife
of
a
marquis
or
an
earl
you
can
only
be
called
this
or
that
you
might
be
he
taller
than
antoun
i
mean
captain
fenton
and
his
eyes
are
just
as
nice
in
their
way
they
quite
haunt
me
since
philae
but
lord
ernest
he
has
some
horrid
common
little
tricks
he
scratches
his
hair
when
he
worried
if
you
look
up
his
coat
sleeves
you
catch
glimpses
of
gray
jaeger
a
thing
i
always
felt
i
could
marry
and
worst
of
all
when
he
finishes
a
meal
and
goes
away
from
the
table
he
walks
off
i
do
suppose
said
i
that
your
first
marcus
antonius
ever
went
away
from
a
table
at
all
on
his
feet
anyhow
while
you
were
doing
him
so
well
in
egypt
he
had
to
be
carried
call
sir
marcus
and
i
stole
the
sirdar
epithet
for
the
other
anthony
a
romantic
figure
his
adoration
for
you
is
a
a
sonnet
there
no
in
his
name
to
bother
you
and
he
fell
in
love
at
first
sight
like
a
real
sport
i
mean
like
the
hero
of
a
book
if
he
has
ways
you
do
approve
you
can
cure
them
redecorate
and
remodel
him
with
the
latest
american
improvements
why
i
believe
he
go
so
far
as
to
give
his
lark
a
tail
if
you
asked
him
to
spell
it
with
an
well
i
suppose
you
right
about
what
i
better
do
she
sighed
a
bird
in
the
hand
oh
i
not
making
a
silly
pun
about
a
lark
is
worth
two
in
new
york
please
tell
you
see
i
engaged
to
sir
marcus
for
he
is
my
bird
in
the
hand
and
i
send
off
a
telegram
the
first
thing
morning
for
fear
he
hears
the
news
that
engaged
to
me
prematurely
where
is
he
do
you
know
by
he
be
at
meröe
camp
i
said
but
i
did
not
add
so
shall
we
chapter
xxxi
the
mountain
of
the
golden
pyramid
there
was
not
much
room
in
our
hearts
for
mountains
or
gold
just
then
yet
somehow
before
we
left
the
palace
anthony
and
i
had
told
brigit
and
monny
the
secret
which
had
been
the
romance
of
our
lives
until
they
came
into
it
to
paint
dead
gold
with
the
living
rose
of
love
victorian
women
would
have
been
grieved
or
angry
with
men
who
could
leave
them
at
such
a
time
but
these
two
instead
of
reproaching
us
urged
us
on
naturally
they
wanted
to
go
with
us
they
said
if
there
were
danger
they
wished
to
share
it
and
if
there
were
to
be
a
find
they
wished
to
be
among
the
first
to
see
what
no
eyes
had
seen
for
two
thousand
years
but
when
anthony
explained
that
there
was
time
to
get
tents
together
and
make
a
decent
camp
for
ladies
even
if
we
were
sure
not
to
tumble
into
trouble
they
said
no
more
this
was
surprising
in
monny
if
not
in
brigit
i
supposed
however
that
she
was
being
on
her
best
behaviour
as
a
kind
of
to
providence
for
its
unexpected
gift
of
legitimate
happiness
our
secret
was
to
be
kept
only
the
sirdar
knew
and
gave
fenton
leave
of
absence
for
a
few
days
the
set
did
not
suspect
the
existence
of
a
mountain
at
meröe
more
important
than
its
neighbours
they
did
not
even
know
what
had
become
of
antoun
effendi
after
he
bade
them
farewell
and
good
luck
from
the
first
he
had
given
it
out
that
he
must
leave
the
party
at
khartum
the
object
of
returning
to
meröe
was
to
meet
sir
marcus
and
i
promised
to
be
back
in
plenty
of
time
to
organize
the
return
trip
to
cairo
my
departure
therefore
was
all
in
the
work
and
the
great
sensation
was
east
engagement
even
though
for
obvious
reasons
monny
love
affair
was
kept
dark
cleopatra
could
not
resist
parading
hers
the
minute
her
wire
to
sir
marcus
had
been
safely
sent
i
got
an
invitation
for
all
the
members
of
the
set
to
a
tennis
party
in
the
palace
gardens
at
which
the
sultan
of
dafur
and
a
bodyguard
armed
with
battle
axes
would
be
the
chief
attraction
also
i
induced
the
landlord
of
our
hotel
to
promise
special
illuminations
music
and
an
impromptu
dance
for
the
evening
this
was
to
make
sure
that
none
of
our
friends
should
find
time
to
see
me
off
at
the
train
anthony
was
to
join
me
there
in
mufti
and
might
be
recognised
by
sharp
eyes
on
the
lookout
for
mysteries
once
we
got
away
that
danger
would
be
past
unless
cleopatra
told
but
i
was
certain
that
she
would
not
to
any
one
ever
again
mention
the
name
of
antoun
it
was
a
full
train
that
night
but
no
one
in
it
who
knew
antoun
many
people
who
had
been
visiting
friends
or
staying
at
an
hotel
for
weeks
were
saying
the
narrow
corridors
of
the
had
african
spears
piled
up
on
the
floor
against
the
wall
very
long
and
inconvenient
ladies
struggled
in
with
baskets
almost
too
big
for
their
compartments
seats
were
littered
with
like
immense
decayed
apple
parings
fearsome
knives
leopard
rugs
in
embryo
and
strange
headgear
in
many
varieties
stuffed
crocodiles
fell
down
from
racks
and
got
underfoot
men
walked
about
with
elephant
tusks
under
their
arms
dragomans
solicited
a
last
tip
a
seven
dinka
black
as
ink
and
splendid
as
a
greek
statue
brought
flowers
from
the
palace
for
some
departing
acquaintance
of
the
sirdar
and
his
wife
officers
in
evening
dress
dashed
up
through
the
sand
on
to
see
the
last
of
friends
their
mess
jackets
making
vivid
spots
of
colour
in
the
electric
light
all
the
fragrant
blossoms
of
khartum
seemed
to
be
sending
farewell
messages
of
perfume
on
the
cool
evening
air
no
more
fantastic
scene
at
a
could
be
imagined
if
the
world
and
its
doings
is
but
a
moving
picture
for
the
gods
on
olympus
they
must
enjoy
the
film
of
a
train
departing
from
khartum
anthony
did
not
join
me
until
just
as
the
train
was
crawling
out
of
the
station
for
we
had
asked
brigit
and
monny
not
to
see
us
off
and
they
had
been
startlingly
acquiescent
we
had
a
compartment
together
and
talked
most
of
the
night
in
low
voices
of
the
mountain
of
the
legends
concerning
it
and
the
papers
of
the
dead
egyptologist
ferlini
which
indirectly
had
brought
fenton
into
monny
gilder
life
and
given
brigit
back
to
me
there
was
the
breakfast
party
too
on
the
terrace
at
shepheard
had
it
not
been
for
this
incident
antoun
the
hadji
would
never
have
been
selected
by
miss
gilder
in
words
she
might
now
like
to
forget
have
but
had
not
a
distressed
artist
called
on
me
one
morning
in
rome
months
ago
with
an
old
notebook
to
sell
i
should
not
have
come
to
egypt
for
my
and
none
of
us
would
have
met
i
had
visited
the
artist
studio
to
please
a
friend
and
bought
a
picture
to
please
him
not
myself
therefore
he
regarded
me
as
a
charitable
dilettante
likely
to
buy
anything
if
properly
approached
bad
luck
had
come
to
him
he
wanted
to
try
pastures
new
and
needed
money
at
short
notice
therefore
he
wished
to
dispose
of
a
secret
which
might
be
the
key
to
fortune
why
did
he
use
the
key
himself
was
the
obvious
question
which
he
answered
by
saying
that
a
poor
man
would
not
be
able
to
find
the
lock
to
fit
it
the
notebook
he
had
to
sell
had
been
the
property
of
a
distinguished
distant
relative
long
since
dead
the
italian
ferlini
who
about
ransacked
the
ruins
of
meröe
in
the
kingdom
of
candace
ferlini
had
given
treasure
in
gold
scarabs
and
jewels
to
berlin
all
of
which
he
had
discovered
in
a
secret
in
the
masonry
of
a
pyramid
in
the
pyramid
field
of
meröe
but
he
had
been
blamed
for
unscientific
work
and
in
some
quarters
it
was
not
believed
that
he
had
found
the
hoard
at
meröe
this
jealousy
and
injustice
had
prevented
ferlini
obtaining
a
grant
for
further
explorations
he
wished
to
make
he
claimed
to
have
proof
that
in
a
certain
mountain
not
far
from
the
meröe
pyramids
and
much
resembling
them
in
shape
was
hidden
the
tomb
of
a
candace
who
lived
two
hundred
years
earlier
than
the
queen
of
that
name
mentioned
in
the
new
testament
mistress
of
the
eunuch
baptized
by
philip
in
the
notebook
which
had
come
down
with
other
belongings
of
ferlini
the
egyptologist
to
ferlini
the
artist
was
a
copy
of
certain
demotic
writing
of
a
peculiar
and
little
known
form
the
original
had
existed
according
to
the
dead
ferlini
notes
on
the
wall
of
an
antechapel
in
one
of
the
most
ruinous
pyramids
at
meröe
decorated
in
a
peculiarly
barbaric
ethiopian
style
the
described
the
making
of
the
mountain
tomb
ordered
by
candace
in
fear
that
her
body
might
be
disturbed
according
to
a
prophecy
which
predicted
the
destruction
of
the
kingdom
if
the
jewels
of
the
dead
were
found
ferlini
a
student
of
the
demotic
writings
which
had
superseded
hieroglyphics
doubted
not
that
he
had
translated
the
revelation
aright
though
he
admitted
supplying
many
missing
words
in
accordance
with
his
own
deductions
he
was
in
disfavour
at
the
time
he
tried
to
organize
an
expedition
in
search
of
the
queen
hoard
and
though
legends
of
the
mountain
confirmed
the
writings
which
ferlini
was
the
first
to
translate
the
italian
could
induce
no
one
to
finance
his
scheme
the
one
person
he
succeeded
in
interesting
had
a
relative
already
excavating
in
egypt
but
eventually
addressed
on
the
subject
this
young
man
replied
that
the
antechapel
in
question
had
fallen
completely
into
ruin
it
would
be
impossible
therefore
to
find
the
if
indeed
it
ever
existed
this
verdict
had
put
an
end
to
ferlini
hopes
and
nothing
remained
of
them
save
the
translated
copy
of
the
writing
in
his
notebook
the
missing
words
inserted
and
the
legends
of
the
negroes
who
generation
after
generation
since
forgotten
times
had
told
the
story
of
the
mountain
of
the
golden
pyramid
nobody
within
the
memory
of
man
had
ever
searched
for
the
problematical
tomb
and
as
tales
of
more
or
less
the
same
character
are
common
in
egypt
i
did
not
place
much
faith
in
the
enthusiastic
jottings
of
ferlini
however
my
love
of
the
unknown
the
mysterious
and
romantic
made
me
feel
that
the
possession
of
the
notebook
was
worth
the
price
asked
two
thousand
lire
when
i
had
brooded
over
it
myself
i
posted
it
to
fenton
at
khartum
and
his
opinion
had
brought
me
to
egypt
thinking
of
the
matter
in
this
way
it
seemed
that
we
owed
our
love
stories
to
the
impecunious
artist
who
had
probably
spent
his
eighty
pounds
and
forgotten
me
by
this
time
in
a
few
hours
or
a
few
days
we
might
owe
him
even
more
anthony
acquainted
with
meröe
its
pyramids
and
pyramidal
mountains
since
his
first
coming
to
the
sudan
had
been
able
to
plan
out
our
campaign
almost
at
an
hour
notice
he
knew
where
to
wire
for
camels
to
take
us
to
our
destination
eighteen
miles
from
kabushîa
also
for
trained
excavators
and
he
knew
one
who
if
the
white
men
were
in
ignorance
could
tell
us
all
the
most
hidden
happenings
of
the
desert
for
fifty
miles
around
this
was
the
great
character
of
the
neighbourhood
among
the
blacks
the
wise
man
of
the
meröitic
desert
who
claimed
to
be
over
a
hundred
years
old
had
a
tribe
of
sons
and
grandsons
and
practically
ruled
the
village
of
bakarawiya
for
countless
generations
his
forbears
had
lived
under
the
shadow
of
the
ruined
pyramids
family
tradition
made
them
the
descendants
of
those
egyptian
warriors
who
revolted
in
the
time
of
king
psammetichus
migrating
from
elephantine
island
to
ethiopia
there
they
were
well
received
by
the
sovereign
given
lands
in
upper
nubia
and
the
title
of
autolomi
or
asmack
meaning
those
who
stand
on
the
left
side
of
the
king
anthony
friend
and
instructor
in
the
lore
of
legends
rejoiced
in
the
name
of
asmack
which
he
proudly
said
had
been
bestowed
on
the
eldest
son
in
his
family
since
time
immemorial
asmack
the
old
and
wise
was
to
meet
us
at
kabushîa
station
with
camels
one
for
each
and
one
for
sir
marcus
in
case
he
had
arrived
and
wished
to
ride
to
the
mountain
of
the
golden
pyramid
it
was
afternoon
when
our
white
train
slowed
down
to
pause
for
a
moment
at
kabushîa
station
and
the
first
face
we
saw
was
that
of
sir
marcus
antonius
a
radiant
face
whose
beaming
smile
was
i
knew
not
so
much
a
welcome
for
us
as
a
sign
that
he
had
received
the
telegram
from
cleopatra
he
hurried
along
the
platform
to
the
steps
of
our
sleeping
car
and
anthony
ready
to
swing
himself
down
before
the
train
stopped
pointed
out
asmack
not
far
off
a
thin
old
black
man
who
must
once
have
been
a
stately
giant
but
bent
forward
now
as
if
searching
the
earth
for
his
own
grave
he
had
got
to
his
feet
from
a
squatting
position
in
the
alluvial
clay
of
this
strange
desert
and
was
gazing
toward
us
his
few
rags
fluttering
in
the
warm
wind
beside
him
stood
a
mere
youth
of
fifty
or
so
and
two
or
three
young
men
with
several
sulky
camels
sir
marcus
began
to
shake
hands
almost
before
we
were
on
the
platform
and
so
did
he
engross
himself
in
us
and
absorb
our
attention
that
none
of
us
quite
knew
when
the
train
went
out
my
dear
boys
he
addressed
us
nearly
breaking
our
finger
bones
lord
fenton
you
even
better
looking
as
a
true
britisher
than
a
false
arab
but
never
mind
that
now
borrow
you
a
trump
i
believe
i
owe
everything
to
you
i
mean
in
the
matter
of
east
it
always
was
my
favourite
name
fenton
knows
thanks
for
the
congratulations
thanks
to
you
both
you
must
be
my
best
men
what
ca
have
but
one
well
it
must
be
borrow
then
i
suppose
oh
about
the
mountain
why
of
course
you
anxious
do
think
i
have
not
been
busy
i
have
got
here
by
special
train
cost
me
a
lot
of
money
but
who
cares
it
worth
it
i
want
to
hurry
things
up
and
get
to
khartum
what
your
blessed
mountain
is
to
you
that
is
a
certain
lady
to
me
what
have
you
found
out
i
managed
at
last
to
cut
short
his
rhapsodies
why
not
much
i
bound
to
confess
but
i
had
only
a
few
hours
some
one
heaven
knows
who
came
here
it
seems
with
arabs
engaged
heaven
knows
where
and
pretended
to
be
my
agent
empowered
by
me
to
work
at
the
mountain
of
the
golden
pyramid
where
it
was
well
known
i
got
the
right
to
excavate
well
the
chap
was
armed
with
credentials
and
had
a
contract
signed
by
me
so
the
authorities
thought
he
was
all
right
of
course
and
let
him
go
on
this
was
more
than
a
month
ago
he
pitched
his
camp
out
by
the
mountain
and
nobody
disturbed
him
fact
is
from
what
i
hear
i
do
believe
the
excavating
men
from
the
liverpool
school
of
archeology
or
whatever
you
call
it
thought
much
of
his
chances
of
success
a
case
of
looking
for
captain
kidd
treasure
he
and
his
men
were
excavating
round
the
mountain
and
he
engaged
some
more
fellows
from
the
neighbourhood
to
make
the
work
go
faster
but
a
few
days
ago
not
yet
a
week
he
discharged
the
lot
paid
them
up
and
sent
them
off
saying
abandoned
hope
of
finding
any
entrance
to
an
alleged
tomb
the
arabs
departed
by
train
but
the
fellows
from
hereabouts
gossiped
a
bit
it
seemed
and
the
story
was
started
that
they
been
got
rid
of
because
the
boss
had
hit
on
something
and
wanted
to
be
left
to
himself
you
have
told
us
yet
the
name
of
the
man
anthony
reminded
him
by
jove
no
more
i
have
i
so
excited
about
everything
you
know
it
but
borrow
will
colonel
corkran
anthony
gave
me
a
look
i
do
know
the
name
he
said
it
the
man
of
my
dream
the
man
of
your
dream
corkran
a
a
dream
which
has
kept
repeating
itself
until
i
grew
superstitious
about
it
a
man
with
a
purplish
sort
of
moustache
i
saw
coming
between
you
and
us
or
looking
at
me
out
of
a
dark
recess
something
like
a
deep
doorway
borrow
said
when
i
told
him
i
was
describing
your
man
corkran
whose
place
he
took
on
your
yacht
well
i
hanged
if
that
not
the
rummiest
go
i
only
hope
he
not
in
that
recess
or
deep
doorway
now
if
it
leads
into
your
mountain
you
remember
borrow
my
telling
you
he
been
alone
for
a
while
in
the
i
use
as
an
office
at
the
semiramis
hotel
and
had
had
a
good
chance
if
he
wanted
to
browse
among
my
papers
well
i
mention
this
to
you
at
the
time
but
an
unsigned
contract
with
you
for
your
services
in
return
for
all
my
rights
in
the
mountain
of
the
golden
pyramid
was
lying
on
the
desk
as
for
the
contract
he
been
showing
here
it
could
only
have
been
for
the
trip
but
it
showed
him
to
be
my
agent
right
enough
and
there
were
two
confidential
letters
on
my
desk
one
from
a
man
i
written
to
an
egyptologist
chap
saying
in
his
opinion
there
be
a
tomb
in
the
mountain
the
other
an
answer
not
finished
telling
him
i
meant
to
run
the
risk
and
had
secured
the
rights
you
know
how
queer
i
thought
it
corkran
should
throw
up
his
job
which
was
paying
him
pretty
well
but
it
was
my
business
and
i
was
jolly
glad
to
be
rid
of
him
as
it
happened
well
here
we
have
the
mystery
explained
not
quite
yet
i
wish
we
had
i
said
thinking
of
the
sly
old
poacher
on
our
preserves
who
had
perhaps
by
this
time
skimmed
the
cream
off
the
secret
it
was
easy
to
guess
why
he
had
sent
away
his
workers
if
indeed
he
had
imagined
himself
on
the
eve
of
a
discovery
rights
to
dig
are
given
on
the
understanding
that
the
egyptian
government
shall
have
half
of
anything
found
worth
the
taking
corkran
scheming
to
be
alone
must
mean
that
he
intended
annexing
what
treasure
he
could
carry
off
and
then
getting
out
of
the
bad
business
already
six
days
had
passed
since
the
arabs
and
nubians
had
left
him
alone
in
his
camp
and
though
it
was
lucky
that
we
had
learned
what
was
going
on
it
might
be
too
late
to
profit
by
the
information
even
if
we
caught
corkran
he
might
have
hidden
his
spoil
where
none
but
he
or
some
messenger
could
ever
find
it
you
go
out
with
us
to
the
mountain
sir
marcus
i
went
on
be
ready
to
start
but
sir
marcus
had
suddenly
become
deaf
he
had
turned
as
if
to
gaze
after
the
long
ago
departed
train
instead
of
answering
me
he
was
stalking
off
toward
a
group
of
people
at
the
far
end
of
the
platform
three
ladies
and
two
men
in
khaki
for
a
second
i
felt
an
impulse
of
indignation
cheek
of
him
to
march
away
like
that
not
caring
much
that
we
had
been
robbed
largely
through
his
carelessness
and
by
one
of
his
own
men
but
the
indignation
turned
to
surprise
sheer
incredulous
amazement
i
glanced
at
anthony
to
learn
whether
he
had
seen
but
he
was
beckoning
the
old
wise
man
of
the
desert
fenton
said
i
it
seems
we
the
only
passengers
to
get
off
here
there
are
three
people
we
know
talking
to
two
we
do
anthony
looked
great
scott
said
he
and
in
another
instant
we
were
following
sir
marcus
hastily
along
the
platform
to
greet
or
scold
we
were
sure
which
it
ought
to
be
the
big
hatted
but
easily
recognised
figures
of
brigit
monny
gilder
and
east
we
could
help
it
monny
cried
in
to
anthony
before
he
had
time
to
reach
the
group
we
knew
you
would
let
us
come
so
we
came
because
we
to
be
in
this
with
you
even
biddy
wanted
to
and
she
so
as
for
aunt
clara
i
believe
she
have
started
without
us
if
we
had
been
wild
for
the
journey
so
you
how
it
was
we
did
see
and
we
could
help
rejoicing
in
their
pluck
as
well
as
in
the
sight
of
them
though
it
was
all
against
our
common
sense
we
ordered
our
own
camels
and
a
tent
and
things
to
eat
and
drink
so
we
sha
be
any
bother
to
you
monny
went
on
as
anthony
rather
gravely
shook
hands
his
eager
brows
lifted
his
eyes
smiling
in
spite
of
himself
we
could
have
done
it
if
it
had
been
for
slatin
pasha
we
first
went
and
confided
to
him
because
we
knew
he
loved
adventures
and
would
be
sure
to
sympathize
these
gentlemen
from
the
camp
are
his
friends
and
they
organized
our
little
expedition
at
his
request
more
than
one
person
can
use
the
telegraph
you
know
and
oh
wo
it
be
lovely
going
with
you
out
into
the
desert
it
was
not
yet
evening
when
we
set
forth
but
it
was
the
birth
of
another
day
when
we
arrived
within
sight
of
corkran
camp
the
tents
glimmered
pale
in
the
light
which
comes
up
out
of
the
desert
before
dawn
as
light
rises
from
the
sea
and
so
deep
was
the
stillness
that
it
might
have
been
a
ghost
camp
there
was
not
even
the
howling
of
a
dog
and
this
silence
was
more
eerie
than
the
silence
of
sleep
in
a
lonely
place
because
of
the
tale
a
grandson
of
asmack
had
brought
to
the
village
he
was
one
of
the
nubian
men
corkran
had
engaged
to
help
his
arab
workmen
from
the
north
and
when
the
whole
gang
had
been
discharged
he
suspecting
that
some
secret
thing
was
on
foot
hid
in
the
that
he
might
return
by
night
to
spy
he
had
wished
his
brothers
to
stay
with
him
but
they
fearing
the
djinns
who
haunt
the
mountain
and
have
power
at
night
refused
and
begged
him
to
come
away
lest
he
be
struck
by
a
terrible
death
the
legend
was
that
queen
candace
the
queen
who
ordered
the
making
of
the
tomb
had
been
a
witch
when
she
died
by
her
magic
arts
learned
from
the
lost
book
of
thoth
she
had
turned
all
those
aware
of
the
tomb
existence
into
djinns
to
guard
the
secret
dwelling
of
her
soul
even
the
great
men
of
the
court
who
by
her
wish
hid
in
the
mountain
her
body
and
jewels
and
treasure
became
djinns
the
moment
they
had
closed
and
concealed
the
entrance
to
the
tomb
they
could
never
impart
the
secret
to
mortals
and
because
of
the
knowledge
which
burned
within
their
hearts
and
the
anguish
of
being
parted
forever
from
those
they
loved
the
tortured
spirits
in
prison
grew
malevolent
while
the
sun
still
worshipped
by
them
as
rã
was
above
the
horizon
they
had
no
power
over
men
but
the
moment
that
rã
died
his
red
death
the
djinns
could
destroy
those
who
ventured
within
such
distance
of
the
mountain
as
its
shadow
might
reach
and
if
any
man
ventured
nearer
in
the
darkness
of
night
he
heard
the
wailing
of
the
spirits
camp
had
been
pitched
beyond
the
shadow
furthest
reach
but
the
night
after
the
workmen
were
discharged
asmack
one
brave
grandson
had
been
led
by
curiosity
to
approach
the
haunted
mountain
when
he
had
crept
within
the
trench
most
lately
dug
he
had
heard
the
wicked
voice
of
the
djinns
raging
and
quarrelling
together
there
had
been
a
threatening
cry
when
they
knew
how
a
man
had
defied
their
power
and
the
nubian
had
escaped
a
fate
too
horrible
to
put
in
words
only
by
running
running
until
his
breath
gave
out
and
the
sun
rose
this
story
gave
the
silent
desert
power
even
over
european
minds
as
we
came
where
the
small
camp
glimmered
just
outside
the
shadow
wicked
circle
not
one
of
asmack
men
would
go
with
us
to
the
tent
which
was
evidently
that
of
the
leader
he
might
be
lying
there
dead
struck
by
the
djinns
they
said
and
all
those
who
looked
upon
the
body
would
be
accursed
the
three
women
would
not
have
gone
to
corkran
tent
even
had
we
allowed
them
to
do
so
and
sir
marcus
already
a
slave
though
a
willing
one
stayed
with
his
adored
lady
and
her
friends
inside
the
ring
which
the
nubians
proceeded
to
make
with
the
camels
carrying
a
lighted
lantern
anthony
and
i
walked
alone
to
the
tent
the
flap
was
down
but
not
fastened
and
the
canvas
moved
slightly
as
if
trembling
fingers
tried
to
hold
it
taut
colonel
corkran
i
called
out
sharply
but
there
was
no
answer
chapter
xxxii
the
secret
anthony
lifted
the
flap
holding
up
the
lantern
and
we
both
looked
in
no
one
was
there
but
the
tent
had
the
look
of
recent
occupation
it
was
neatly
arranged
as
the
tent
of
an
old
soldier
should
be
but
on
the
table
stood
a
candle
stuck
in
a
bottle
and
beside
it
a
book
lay
open
face
downward
entering
the
tent
the
first
thing
i
did
was
to
glance
at
the
title
of
this
book
it
was
a
learned
archeological
treatise
here
and
there
a
paragraph
was
marked
and
leaves
three
other
volumes
of
the
same
sort
were
piled
one
upon
the
other
anthony
and
i
had
read
all
four
during
the
last
few
months
since
our
minds
had
concentrated
on
the
subject
of
pyramids
and
rock
tombs
what
do
you
think
has
become
of
corkran
i
said
to
anthony
i
think
the
djinns
have
got
him
he
answered
gravely
you
mean
i
do
quite
know
what
i
mean
but
he
must
have
hit
upon
something
and
then
have
been
prevented
from
coming
back
why
should
he
have
had
such
luck
after
a
few
weeks
work
an
unscientific
fellow
like
him
if
the
secret
of
the
mountain
has
been
inviolate
for
over
two
thousand
years
wait
and
see
what
happened
to
him
before
you
call
it
duffer
but
you
must
remember
that
nobody
except
ferlini
and
a
few
superstitious
blacks
ever
believed
that
the
mountain
had
a
secret
incredulity
has
protected
it
and
corkran
had
to
work
like
a
thousand
devils
if
he
hoped
to
get
hold
of
anything
before
he
was
found
out
i
believe
he
has
got
hold
of
something
and
that
it
then
got
hold
of
him
but
we
shall
see
yes
we
shall
see
i
repeated
and
before
long
if
we
too
have
luck
i
hope
it
wo
be
the
same
kind
as
his
but
come
along
out
of
this
we
must
get
to
work
before
sunrise
and
try
for
a
result
of
some
sort
before
the
worst
of
the
heat
if
found
anything
we
ought
pretty
quickly
to
profit
by
his
weeks
of
frantic
labour
that
maybe
will
be
our
revenge
we
had
to
tell
the
party
what
we
had
found
in
the
tent
and
what
we
meant
to
do
next
sir
marcus
was
now
excused
by
east
but
until
summoned
by
us
the
ladies
were
to
remain
where
they
were
under
shelter
of
the
tent
which
the
were
getting
into
shape
when
exhorted
to
be
patient
they
received
the
advice
in
sweet
silence
but
we
did
not
until
later
attach
much
importance
to
this
unusual
mood
perhaps
at
the
moment
we
were
too
preoccupied
to
notice
expressions
even
in
the
eyes
we
loved
best
we
took
with
us
two
men
whom
asmack
had
provided
as
diggers
and
in
five
minutes
we
were
at
the
base
of
the
little
dark
conical
mountain
which
for
weeks
had
been
the
object
of
our
dreams
now
standing
face
to
face
with
it
the
glamour
faded
the
mountain
of
the
golden
pyramid
was
exactly
like
a
dozen
other
tumbled
shapes
of
black
rock
grouped
or
scattered
over
the
dull
clay
desert
which
many
centuries
ago
had
been
the
fertile
realm
of
candace
why
should
a
queen
have
selected
it
from
among
its
lumpish
fellows
to
do
it
secret
honour
but
corkran
had
had
faith
here
were
traces
of
what
fenton
called
his
frantic
labours
a
parallel
trench
had
been
dug
with
the
evident
object
of
unearthing
a
buried
entrance
into
the
mountain
down
it
went
through
hardened
sand
and
clay
to
a
depth
of
eight
or
ten
feet
and
descending
we
found
as
we
expected
to
do
several
low
tunnels
driven
at
right
angles
toward
the
mountain
itself
one
after
another
we
entered
crawling
on
hands
and
knees
only
to
come
up
against
a
solid
wall
of
rock
at
the
end
each
of
these
burrows
represented
just
so
much
toil
and
disappointment
but
corkran
whose
undertaking
could
be
justified
even
to
his
own
mind
only
by
success
had
not
been
discouraged
the
trench
went
round
three
sides
of
the
mountain
as
we
soon
discovered
and
the
corner
of
the
fourth
façade
not
having
yet
been
turned
it
seemed
a
sign
that
corkran
had
as
anthony
said
hit
upon
something
or
thought
that
he
had
done
so
otherwise
he
would
not
have
discharged
his
men
before
the
fourth
gallery
was
begun
we
had
started
from
the
south
because
our
camp
faced
the
long
trench
on
that
side
and
it
was
quicker
to
jump
into
it
than
to
walk
round
and
examine
the
excavations
from
on
the
east
the
plan
of
the
work
was
the
same
as
on
the
south
except
that
the
tunnels
leading
mountainward
were
driven
at
different
distances
relatively
to
each
other
and
each
of
these
also
ended
in
a
de
now
remained
the
trench
on
the
north
side
of
the
mountain
which
was
the
most
promising
direction
for
a
find
and
as
we
turned
the
corner
which
brought
us
into
this
third
trench
the
sun
rose
making
the
sky
blossom
like
the
primrose
fields
of
heaven
on
this
side
sand
driven
by
the
northerly
wind
which
never
rests
had
banked
itself
high
against
the
mountain
and
the
excavation
had
been
a
more
serious
task
there
were
only
two
tunnels
and
into
both
sand
had
fallen
one
was
nearly
blocked
up
and
impossible
to
enter
without
reopening
but
we
took
it
for
granted
hopefully
that
the
second
had
been
made
later
this
ran
toward
the
mountain
with
a
northeasterly
slant
and
though
it
was
partly
choked
by
sand
it
was
possible
to
crawl
in
anthony
insisted
on
going
first
i
followed
at
the
pace
of
my
early
ancestor
the
worm
and
sir
marcus
comfortably
waited
outside
he
wanted
to
be
a
pioneer
only
in
financial
paths
and
after
all
this
was
mountain
now
it
was
worth
his
while
to
be
killed
in
it
besides
as
he
pointed
out
if
anything
happened
to
us
there
must
be
some
one
to
organize
a
rescue
and
break
the
news
to
the
ladies
anthony
had
a
small
electric
torch
and
i
a
lantern
but
going
on
hands
and
knees
we
could
use
the
lights
only
now
and
then
when
we
had
crept
ahead
descending
always
for
twelve
or
fifteen
feet
anthony
stopped
hullo
i
heard
him
call
in
a
muffled
reverberating
voice
the
reason
why
corkran
sent
his
arabs
away
what
is
it
i
yelled
my
heart
jumping
the
rock
been
cut
back
by
the
hands
of
men
his
men
perhaps
no
it
is
done
like
that
nowadays
the
tunnel
turns
here
dips
down
and
goes
on
along
this
flat
wall
i
bet
corkran
always
kept
ahead
of
the
men
when
he
saw
this
he
discharged
his
workers
and
yet
it
may
be
nothing
of
importance
after
all
only
a
flat
surface
for
some
old
such
as
romans
and
even
egyptian
soldiers
made
constantly
on
the
march
the
rumbling
voice
ceased
as
anthony
crawled
round
the
turn
of
the
passage
i
followed
literally
close
on
his
heels
the
burrow
descending
like
a
suddenly
anthony
stopped
again
come
into
a
sort
of
chamber
corkran
scooped
out
i
heard
him
say
it
high
enough
to
sit
up
in
no
to
stand
up
in
this
is
the
end
of
the
passage
i
think
by
jove
look
out
he
had
disappeared
in
the
darkness
behind
a
higher
arch
in
the
roof
of
the
gallery
as
he
cried
out
i
slipped
through
after
him
slid
down
a
steep
abrupt
slope
and
by
the
light
of
my
agitated
lantern
saw
anthony
standing
in
a
hole
into
which
he
had
evidently
stumbled
let
me
give
you
a
hand
up
i
said
no
thank
you
he
answered
in
a
tense
excited
voice
this
is
where
i
want
to
be
look
i
looked
and
saw
at
the
bottom
of
the
hole
a
crevice
in
the
flat
wall
of
rock
which
we
had
been
following
down
the
passage
after
its
turn
from
the
right
angle
way
to
creep
along
the
mountainside
out
of
this
crevice
protruded
a
large
iron
crowbar
apparently
jammed
into
place
the
first
tool
we
had
seen
anywhere
the
chamber
in
which
i
stood
was
littered
and
piled
up
with
hard
masses
of
earth
which
had
been
thrown
out
of
the
hole
and
on
the
rough
floor
of
the
latter
i
stepped
on
the
spade
which
had
done
the
work
it
nearly
turned
my
ankle
as
i
jumped
on
to
it
but
i
hardly
felt
the
pain
torch
and
lantern
showed
clearly
that
the
crevice
in
the
wall
was
not
a
natural
crack
but
a
opening
it
was
as
if
a
slab
of
rock
fitted
roughly
into
grooves
had
first
been
lifted
and
had
then
fallen
heavily
on
to
the
crowbar
i
set
the
lantern
on
the
earthy
floor
and
its
yellow
light
streamed
through
the
crack
whence
the
crowbar
protruded
like
a
black
pipe
in
a
negro
mouth
it
was
all
darkness
on
the
other
side
from
behind
the
screen
of
rock
set
in
its
deep
grooves
came
the
strangest
sound
i
ever
heard
or
shall
ever
hear
it
was
a
voice
groaning
yet
it
was
not
like
a
human
voice
the
horrid
idea
jumped
into
my
head
that
it
was
the
howl
of
an
evil
spirit
sitting
in
a
dead
man
skull
he
alive
then
exclaimed
anthony
pale
in
the
sickly
light
is
that
you
corkran
he
called
the
only
answer
was
another
groan
i
see
the
whole
business
now
do
you
fenton
said
this
passage
is
very
steep
already
it
was
far
under
before
we
got
to
the
cutting
on
the
mountain
wall
and
it
must
have
been
under
for
many
centuries
they
dug
deep
down
to
make
the
tomb
and
then
covered
up
the
entrance
with
earth
when
corkran
got
to
his
portcullis
he
thought
he
reached
the
reward
of
his
labours
well
so
he
had
the
punishment
here
the
heap
of
stone
he
used
as
a
fulcrum
for
his
lever
the
heap
tumbled
when
he
was
on
the
other
side
and
the
slab
of
rock
came
down
to
trap
him
we
have
to
build
up
his
fulcrum
again
before
we
can
do
anything
ourselves
together
we
forced
the
flat
end
of
the
crowbar
into
the
crevice
pressed
a
piece
of
rock
under
it
and
exerted
all
our
strength
the
slab
moved
upward
an
inch
or
two
grating
in
its
rough
grooves
the
crack
no
higher
than
the
diameter
of
the
crowbar
plus
a
stone
or
two
when
we
saw
it
first
was
now
twice
its
original
height
in
went
another
stone
and
so
on
we
worked
like
demons
in
hell
and
in
an
atmosphere
almost
as
hot
and
breathless
yet
we
could
breathe
whether
all
the
air
we
got
came
through
the
long
twisting
passage
corkran
had
made
or
whether
there
were
ventilation
from
the
other
side
of
the
some
opening
in
an
unseen
cave
we
could
not
tell
all
we
knew
was
that
the
mountain
had
a
secret
and
that
the
man
who
had
tried
to
rob
us
of
our
rights
to
it
was
caught
in
the
trap
of
the
djinns
our
rights
how
fragile
as
how
almost
laughable
they
seemed
down
here
rights
we
had
bargained
for
with
men
which
they
not
owning
them
had
gravely
given
i
suddenly
realized
and
i
think
anthony
realized
as
sweating
and
silent
we
piled
up
the
fulcrum
of
stones
thrown
down
by
the
djinns
that
they
alone
or
the
sleeping
queen
they
guarded
had
rights
in
this
hidden
place
when
we
had
raised
the
slab
to
a
height
of
about
two
feet
in
its
grooves
and
had
made
sure
that
the
stones
held
it
firmly
in
place
we
told
each
other
that
it
was
time
to
cross
the
threshold
the
was
scarcely
more
than
a
yard
in
width
and
we
crawled
through
in
single
file
anthony
going
ahead
as
before
with
his
torch
i
passed
my
lantern
in
after
him
and
then
followed
as
i
crept
through
the
narrow
aperture
i
was
conscious
among
other
emotions
of
vague
disappointment
if
this
is
the
way
to
a
tomb
and
the
only
way
there
ca
be
anything
very
fine
to
discover
i
said
to
myself
why
the
entrance
is
big
enough
to
let
in
a
sarcophagus
it
the
man
of
my
dreams
all
right
and
he
lying
close
to
a
doorway
like
the
one
where
i
seen
him
often
i
told
you
so
anthony
was
saying
in
quite
a
commonplace
voice
as
i
picked
myself
up
on
the
other
side
of
the
we
were
in
a
small
chamber
more
roughly
hewn
and
not
so
large
as
the
inner
sanctuary
of
abu
simbel
which
i
had
such
good
cause
to
remember
exactly
opposite
the
entrance
by
which
we
had
come
in
was
as
anthony
had
said
a
door
deeply
set
in
the
rock
a
door
of
the
same
type
as
that
through
which
we
had
passed
and
in
the
shadow
of
the
overhanging
arch
lay
the
heavy
figure
of
colonel
corkran
dressed
in
khaki
his
eyes
were
open
but
he
did
not
stir
as
we
bent
over
him
only
his
lips
moved
slightly
as
if
he
were
making
a
grimace
he
trying
to
ask
for
something
to
eat
or
drink
said
fenton
what
a
confounded
fool
i
am
i
nothing
not
even
a
flask
have
you
no
i
go
back
at
once
and
get
something
i
answered
strange
but
i
was
not
in
the
least
angry
with
corkran
whom
i
had
been
execrating
perhaps
this
was
partly
because
the
impression
that
the
djinns
had
sole
rights
here
was
growing
stronger
every
moment
we
were
all
interlopers
usurpers
without
stopping
for
more
words
i
turned
my
back
to
the
secret
still
unsolved
to
my
surprise
however
i
saw
a
light
stronger
than
our
own
shining
outside
the
partly
raised
screen
of
rock
getting
on
my
knees
to
crawl
out
my
face
almost
met
the
face
of
monny
gilder
about
to
crawl
in
involuntarily
i
gave
way
and
in
she
crept
like
a
big
baby
biddy
coming
after
then
we
laughed
though
i
had
seldom
felt
less
like
laughing
and
the
echo
of
our
laughter
was
as
if
the
spirits
laughed
behind
our
backs
we
never
we
would
come
monny
hastily
began
before
anthony
could
speak
we
just
kept
still
and
sir
marcus
thought
you
would
much
mind
because
the
two
nicest
nubians
brought
us
quite
safely
oh
is
it
wonderful
and
to
be
here
when
you
open
that
door
but
why
it
one
of
our
men
with
you
it
it
the
do
call
him
names
now
dearest
brigit
begged
poor
wretch
he
looks
nearly
dead
what
a
good
thing
we
brought
the
biscuits
and
brandy
i
was
going
for
some
i
said
not
only
had
i
got
to
my
feet
again
but
had
helped
biddy
to
hers
and
anthony
had
snatched
his
tall
monny
up
as
if
she
had
been
a
bundle
of
the
angels
it
would
never
have
done
to
tell
them
how
glad
we
were
that
they
had
disobeyed
us
it
was
providence
apparently
not
marcus
lark
who
had
sent
them
to
the
rescue
we
thought
perhaps
if
you
found
anything
interesting
you
want
to
stay
with
it
a
long
time
explained
monny
that
why
we
brought
you
food
and
drink
it
is
a
good
thing
we
came
is
it
fenton
and
i
did
not
answer
instead
we
occupied
ourselves
with
ministering
to
the
enemy
a
few
bits
of
crumbled
biscuit
a
few
drops
of
brandy
to
moisten
them
he
mumbled
and
swallowed
and
choked
and
slowly
the
veinous
red
came
back
to
the
flabby
gray
cheeks
with
their
prickles
of
sprouting
beard
it
fresh
air
he
needs
now
said
anthony
he
wo
die
from
two
or
three
days
fasting
not
he
and
it
ca
be
more
for
it
would
have
taken
him
days
and
nights
of
hard
work
to
get
here
after
his
men
were
sent
off
jove
i
believe
it
more
funk
than
anything
else
laid
him
low
thought
he
was
done
for
and
all
that
look
there
his
upset
on
the
floor
it
could
have
been
very
gay
for
him
when
the
light
went
out
lend
a
hand
duffer
and
we
give
him
to
the
nubians
the
girls
have
brought
they
carry
him
to
his
own
tent
he
never
got
as
far
in
as
the
second
door
here
so
we
need
search
him
otherwise
i
would
like
a
shot
yes
it
was
something
higher
than
a
mere
financier
who
sent
the
girls
to
us
in
the
antechamber
of
the
secret
we
could
not
for
their
own
sakes
have
risked
bringing
them
but
here
they
were
and
we
should
always
have
this
memory
together
we
told
ourselves
though
we
did
not
tell
the
disobedient
ones
that
would
have
been
a
bad
precedent
what
there
was
to
see
they
would
see
with
us
and
even
the
djinns
could
not
work
harm
to
angels
we
went
out
and
collected
more
stones
with
which
to
prop
up
the
second
screen
of
rock
which
was
not
so
thick
as
the
first
and
used
spade
to
hold
it
up
at
last
beyond
was
another
roughly
hewn
chamber
and
at
the
far
end
set
in
a
curiously
fitted
frame
of
wood
a
wooden
door
looking
almost
as
new
as
though
it
had
been
made
yesterday
anthony
flashed
his
electric
torch
over
it
and
we
saw
the
grain
of
deal
there
was
a
bronze
lock
and
a
latch
of
strange
crude
workmanship
which
monny
touched
deprecatingly
may
i
she
half
whispered
for
to
her
also
the
place
was
haunted
she
seemed
to
ask
permission
of
spirits
rather
than
of
her
lover
but
the
latch
did
not
move
it
would
be
sacrilege
to
break
the
lock
she
said
what
shall
you
do
take
the
door
off
its
supports
they
not
hinges
fenton
answered
in
the
queer
low
tone
which
somehow
we
all
instinctively
adopted
we
got
one
or
two
implements
may
help
to
do
the
trick
he
worked
cautiously
even
tenderly
for
this
queen
secret
was
our
secret
in
the
finding
even
if
the
right
to
it
was
in
the
keeping
of
the
djinns
monny
held
my
lantern
and
it
was
a
good
half
hour
before
anthony
and
i
together
could
carefully
lift
the
deal
door
unbroken
from
its
place
still
monny
held
the
lantern
and
at
the
threshold
of
a
dimly
seen
room
beyond
we
all
drew
back
for
on
the
sanded
floor
were
footprints
to
them
the
girl
pointed
her
eyes
turning
to
anthony
face
as
if
to
ask
how
can
it
be
that
any
one
came
in
when
the
door
was
locked
and
there
was
that
screen
of
rock
to
raise
but
as
we
looked
over
one
another
shoulders
we
realised
that
the
prints
were
not
made
by
modern
boots
they
were
the
marks
of
sandals
and
they
went
across
the
floor
to
a
thing
that
glittered
in
the
middle
of
the
room
a
vague
shape
like
a
draped
coffin
with
something
high
and
pointed
on
top
crossed
to
a
glittering
table
on
which
a
ray
from
the
lantern
revealed
offerings
to
the
dead
a
loaf
a
roasted
duck
its
wings
neatly
tied
with
string
cakes
and
fruit
all
dried
and
blackened
but
perfect
in
form
and
a
saucer
of
incense
from
which
a
little
ash
had
fallen
from
a
ghostly
pastille
onto
the
table
there
the
sandalled
feet
had
paused
while
the
incense
caught
a
spark
and
moving
on
had
walked
straight
to
the
door
a
faint
fragrance
from
perfume
jars
came
to
our
nostrils
a
strange
subtle
fragrance
still
though
most
of
its
sweetness
had
gone
leaving
more
marked
the
smell
of
fat
which
had
held
the
perfume
all
these
years
while
civilizations
grew
up
and
perished
the
man
who
had
lit
the
incense
and
locked
the
door
seemed
to
have
hurried
back
from
who
knew
where
to
stand
behind
us
saying
i
forbid
you
entrance
in
the
name
of
the
ancient
gods
we
could
not
see
him
nor
hear
his
voice
but
we
could
feel
that
he
was
there
and
something
in
us
revolted
against
the
ruthlessness
of
disobeying
of
forcing
our
way
into
the
room
in
spite
of
him
to
crush
his
footprints
with
ours
why
does
the
sand
glitter
so
monny
asked
everything
glitters
everything
looks
as
if
it
were
made
of
gold
the
mountain
of
the
golden
pyramid
biddy
murmured
go
in
first
you
two
and
bless
the
place
i
said
my
heart
wildly
beating
they
obeyed
for
once
moving
delicately
as
if
to
music
which
ears
of
men
were
not
fine
enough
to
hear
they
went
hand
in
hand
and
as
monny
in
her
straight
dress
held
up
the
lantern
i
thought
of
the
wise
virgin
when
this
room
had
last
been
lighted
the
parable
of
the
virgins
of
the
lamps
was
yet
unspoken
it
is
not
sand
said
monny
gasping
a
little
in
the
heavy
air
it
is
sprinkled
gold
dust
now
it
is
on
the
soles
of
our
feet
it
shines
it
shines
anthony
and
i
followed
still
with
that
curious
sense
of
hesitation
as
if
we
ought
to
apologize
to
some
one
the
room
of
the
dead
was
very
close
and
we
drew
our
breath
with
difficulty
for
a
moment
but
the
discomfort
passed
mechanically
we
avoided
the
footmarks
printed
in
gold
avoided
them
as
if
they
had
been
covered
by
invisible
feet
monny
was
right
everything
was
gold
and
it
shone
it
shone
dust
from
the
terrible
mines
of
nub
whence
the
never
returned
lay
thickly
scattered
over
the
the
walls
of
rock
were
plastered
with
gold
leaf
as
high
as
the
low
ceiling
and
upon
the
ceiling
itself
on
a
background
of
deep
blue
colour
was
traced
in
gold
the
form
of
nut
goddess
of
night
her
long
arms
outspread
across
an
azure
sky
of
golden
stars
the
table
of
offerings
was
decorated
with
gold
in
barbaric
patterns
and
the
saucer
which
held
the
burnt
pastille
of
incense
was
of
gold
crudely
designed
but
beautiful
cloth
of
gold
soft
as
old
linen
draped
a
coffin
in
the
centre
of
the
room
and
hid
the
conical
object
on
the
coffin
lid
on
a
sudden
half
savage
impulse
i
lifted
the
covering
with
a
pang
of
fear
lest
the
fabric
should
drop
to
pieces
but
it
did
not
its
limp
yet
heavy
folds
fell
across
my
feet
as
i
stood
looking
at
the
wonderful
thing
it
had
concealed
there
was
no
sarcophagus
of
stone
the
doors
leading
to
the
were
not
large
enough
to
have
admitted
one
instead
there
was
an
extraordinarily
high
narrow
coffin
or
richly
gilded
and
decorated
with
intricate
designs
different
from
any
i
had
seen
in
the
museum
at
cairo
the
top
of
the
case
represented
the
figure
of
a
woman
with
a
smiling
golden
face
painted
lips
and
hair
but
the
strangeness
and
wonder
were
under
the
long
eyelids
and
in
the
woman
hands
the
slanting
eyes
had
each
an
immense
cabuchon
emerald
for
its
iris
set
round
with
brilliant
stones
like
diamonds
curiously
cut
and
the
carved
gilded
hands
of
wood
with
realistic
fingers
wearing
rings
were
clasped
round
a
pyramid
of
gold
this
it
was
which
had
betrayed
its
conical
shape
through
the
drapery
of
gold
cloth
the
opening
in
the
miniature
pyramid
was
not
concealed
there
was
a
little
door
guarded
by
a
tiny
golden
sphinx
and
on
the
neck
of
the
sphinx
suspended
by
a
delicate
chain
was
a
bell
it
is
to
call
the
spirit
of
the
queen
if
a
profane
touch
should
violate
her
tomb
fenton
said
dreamily
he
was
beginning
to
look
like
a
man
hypnotized
perhaps
it
was
the
close
air
with
its
lingering
perfume
of
two
thousand
years
ago
perhaps
it
was
something
else
more
subtile
something
else
that
we
could
all
feel
as
one
feels
the
touch
of
a
living
hand
that
moves
under
a
cloak
no
one
spoke
for
an
instant
i
think
we
half
expected
the
bell
to
ring
then
fenton
said
monny
you
and
must
choose
which
is
to
have
the
privilege
of
finding
out
the
secret
of
the
golden
pyramid
the
duffer
and
i
want
it
to
be
one
of
you
oh
no
not
i
cried
monny
almost
angrily
nor
i
biddy
firmly
echoed
duffer
the
papers
were
yours
will
you
anthony
began
no
i
it
was
faith
in
the
mountain
that
brought
us
to
it
i
reminded
him
it
ought
to
be
you
if
if
it
ought
to
be
one
of
monny
broke
in
with
a
little
breathless
catch
in
her
voice
if
but
what
do
you
mean
anthony
turned
an
odd
startled
look
upon
the
girl
i
hardly
know
what
i
mean
only
i
could
touch
anything
here
they
are
they
been
hers
for
two
thousand
and
two
hundred
years
i
never
thought
i
should
feel
like
this
i
rather
drop
dead
this
minute
than
try
to
take
that
little
pyramid
out
of
those
golden
hands
they
clasped
it
so
long
she
wanted
so
much
to
keep
the
secret
anthony
this
is
the
strongest
feeling
that
ever
came
into
my
heart
except
love
for
you
this
feeling
that
we
have
no
right
that
it
would
be
monstrous
to
rob
this
queen
it
would
be
robbing
anthony
said
heavily
we
have
the
right
oh
i
biddy
whispered
what
would
become
of
museums
if
everybody
felt
as
you
suddenly
feel
or
think
you
feel
fenton
went
on
if
it
were
wrong
to
open
tombs
the
best
men
in
egypt
not
wrong
perhaps
monny
explained
but
oh
i
sure
you
understand
i
sure
in
your
hearts
you
both
you
men
feel
just
as
we
do
now
we
in
this
wonderful
secret
place
that
something
forbids
i
do
know
whether
it
something
in
ourselves
or
outside
but
it
says
no
whatever
others
do
can
not
do
this
thing
if
you
did
feel
it
you
would
have
taken
the
pyramid
out
of
those
poor
hands
and
tried
to
tear
off
the
rings
and
open
the
coffin
itself
to
get
at
the
mummy
but
you
have
either
of
you
you
want
to
do
it
you
ca
i
dare
one
of
you
to
tell
me
it
only
for
biddy
and
me
that
you
kept
your
hands
off
we
come
a
long
way
and
have
done
a
good
deal
to
find
this
secret
that
we
expected
egypt
to
give
us
i
said
dully
instead
of
answering
her
challenge
monny
had
no
argument
for
me
she
turned
to
anthony
the
secret
you
expected
egypt
to
give
she
echoed
and
has
egypt
given
you
a
secret
yes
said
anthony
egypt
has
given
us
a
secret
the
greatest
secret
of
all
but
is
there
a
i
wonder
if
that
is
the
only
secret
which
one
open
and
learn
by
heart
without
breaking
the
charm
biddy
seemed
to
be
speaking
to
herself
but
we
heard
the
secret
of
love
goes
on
forever
being
a
secret
does
it
the
more
you
find
out
about
it
just
as
the
world
and
its
beauty
grows
greater
and
more
wonderful
the
higher
you
climb
up
a
mountain
but
other
secrets
you
find
them
out
and
they
gone
like
a
bright
soap
bubble
nothing
can
mend
broken
romance
if
we
did
touch
anything
here
what
a
memory
this
would
be
to
carry
away
monny
said
do
you
remember
anthony
my
saying
once
how
i
loved
to
dream
of
all
the
beautiful
lost
things
hidden
beneath
the
sea
and
earth
never
to
be
found
while
the
world
lasts
and
stuck
miserably
under
glass
cases
you
said
you
felt
the
same
in
some
moods
i
love
those
moods
i
felt
i
feel
so
about
things
in
general
anthony
admitted
it
was
my
romantic
side
you
appealed
to
have
you
a
better
side
no
better
but
more
practical
is
in
general
a
thing
particular
personal
and
definite
if
we
should
be
quixotic
enough
not
to
take
what
we
earned
the
right
to
take
we
should
be
called
fools
instead
of
claiming
our
half
the
egyptian
government
would
get
all
let
it
monny
cried
a
government
is
a
big
cold
soulless
impersonality
it
never
could
know
the
thrill
that
in
our
blood
this
wonderful
minute
or
miss
the
thrill
if
it
were
destroyed
do
you
mind
being
called
a
fool
anthony
and
you
lord
ernest
anthony
was
silent
but
something
made
me
speak
i
do
mind
you
know
i
always
been
a
duffer
our
future
largely
depends
on
this
fenton
persisted
with
a
conscientious
wish
to
persuade
us
and
himself
i
believe
it
does
monny
strangely
agreed
with
him
what
do
you
mean
anthony
voice
was
suddenly
sharp
with
some
emotion
which
sounded
more
like
anxiety
than
anger
do
you
mean
that
if
ernest
borrow
and
i
insist
on
our
rights
to
whatever
treasure
is
hidden
here
you
and
will
think
less
of
us
not
less
nothing
you
could
do
would
make
us
think
less
after
all
that
has
happened
to
us
together
but
could
it
ever
be
as
it
has
been
as
beautiful
as
sweet
with
all
the
dearest
kind
of
romance
in
our
thoughts
of
you
you
see
you
the
glory
of
finding
the
secret
queen
candace
saved
it
for
you
she
would
give
it
to
such
a
man
as
colonel
corkran
she
knew
he
would
respect
her
maybe
she
hoped
would
i
seem
to
hear
her
saying
so
all
this
gold
and
the
treasure
we
have
seen
is
hers
it
been
hers
for
more
than
two
thousand
years
why
should
we
steal
it
are
a
horrid
cold
government
it
wo
be
our
fault
whatever
a
government
may
choose
to
do
she
know
that
and
so
shall
we
besides
we
can
beg
to
have
the
tomb
kept
like
this
for
the
great
shrine
of
meröe
our
memory
of
this
place
ca
have
the
glamour
torn
away
whatever
happens
nothing
sordid
will
come
between
it
and
us
as
it
would
if
why
after
all
the
great
difference
between
opening
the
coffin
of
a
woman
dead
thousands
of
years
ago
or
a
few
months
supposing
people
wanted
to
dig
up
queen
elizabeth
to
see
what
had
been
buried
with
her
or
napoleon
what
an
outcry
there
be
all
over
the
world
this
poor
queen
is
defenceless
because
her
civilization
is
dead
too
could
force
open
the
lid
of
her
coffin
lord
ernest
and
take
the
jewels
off
her
neck
just
now
i
feel
as
if
i
could
i
confessed
humbly
and
you
anthony
what
if
died
and
asked
to
have
the
jewels
i
loved
because
you
given
them
put
on
my
body
to
lie
there
till
eternity
and
do
anthony
cut
her
short
there
are
some
things
i
ca
listen
to
from
you
and
some
things
you
ca
you
may
think
you
could
but
go
and
take
the
golden
pyramid
out
of
those
golden
hands
if
you
can
i
shall
not
take
it
said
anthony
i
shall
never
take
it
now
you
must
know
that
i
not
saying
i
sha
go
on
loving
you
if
you
go
against
me
i
shall
love
you
always
i
ca
help
that
but
that
it
the
let
it
all
go
at
least
we
had
the
adventure
and
we
got
love
i
do
want
the
treasure
now
or
the
secret
i
give
up
my
part
in
them
forever
for
me
yes
for
you
but
there
something
more
another
reason
i
think
so
frankly
it
is
all
for
you
only
you
made
me
feel
it
without
you
i
might
have
felt
it
but
too
late
if
there
a
drop
of
egyptian
blood
in
my
veins
why
yes
it
must
be
that
telling
me
the
same
thing
that
you
have
told
this
egyptian
queen
may
lose
her
treasure
and
must
lose
her
secret
but
it
wo
be
through
me
and
because
you
would
steal
them
she
has
given
you
the
secret
and
the
treasure
the
best
of
both
with
her
royal
blessing
biddy
said
is
what
ferlini
papers
and
the
legends
really
meant
for
you
and
ernest
everything
that
happened
not
only
in
egypt
but
in
our
whole
lives
has
been
leading
up
to
the
discovery
of
the
treasure
and
the
secret
that
we
can
take
without
stealing
do
you
know
what
talking
about
and
if
you
do
was
it
worth
coming
so
far
to
find
this
treasure
that
i
mean
and
this
secret
we
know
very
well
anthony
said
and
know
that
we
realize
it
was
worth
journeying
to
the
end
of
the
world
for
or
into
the
next
or
into
the
next
monny
echoed
here
we
on
the
threshold
of
the
next
that
why
the
queen
blessing
feels
so
near
the
end
