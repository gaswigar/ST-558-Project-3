an

matter

half

keep
from

octave
feuillet
possesses
to
an
altogether
remarkable
degree
the
art
of
being
serious
not
only
gaily
but
charmingly
this
to
begin
with
places
him
and
his
stories
in
a
particular
atmosphere
and
if
we
consider
it
i
think
we
shall
recognise
that
atmosphere
as
something
very
like
the
old
familiar
atmosphere
of
the
at
any
rate
there
is
a
delicate
a
fanciful
symbolism
in
feuillet
s
work
which
breathes
a
fragrance
unmistakably
reminiscent
of
the
enchanted
forest
for
an
instance
one
may
recall
the
chapter
in
mariage
dans
le
which
relates
the
escapade
of
lionel
and
his
betrothed
on
the
day
before
their
wedding
a
conventional
mother
busy
with
preparations
for
the
ceremony
intrusts
her
daughter
to
the
chaperonage
of
an
old
aunt
who
is
we
might
suppose
exactly
the
person
for
the
office
but
old
aunts
are
sometimes
wonderfully
made
sometimes
they
keep
the
most
surprises
up
those
capacious
sleeves
of
theirs
this
one
was
a
fairy
godmother
in
disguise
and
i
suspect
a
pupil
of
the
blackstick
with
cynicism
she
remarks
that
the
happiest
period
of
even
the
happiest
married
life
is
the
day
before
it
begins
and
she
advises
her
young
charges
to
make
the
most
of
them
indeed
from
her
presence
be
off
with
you
my
children
come
be
off
with
you
at
once
they
escape
to
the
park
where
they
romp
like
a
pair
of
truant
that
is
all
but
in
feuillet
s
hands
it
becomes
a
fairy
idyl
it
serves
besides
the
symbolic
purpose
of
striking
at
the
outset
the
note
of
joyousness
which
he
means
to
repeat
at
the
end
though
the
book
is
one
that
threatens
almost
to
the
last
page
to
end
on
a
note
of
despair
for
mariage
dans
le
if
far
from
being
the
most
successful
of
feuillet
s
novels
exhibits
none
the
less
some
of
his
cleverest
craftsmanship
he
hoodwinks
us
into
the
fear
that
he
meditates
disaster
only
pleasantly
genially
at
the
right
moment
to
disappoint
us
with
the
denouement
we
could
have
wished
feuillet
s
geniality
for
that
matter
runs
through
all
his
books
and
is
one
of
the
vital
principles
of
his
talent
it
is
never
the
flaccid
geniality
the
amiability
of
the
undiscerning
person
it
is
rather
the
wise
and
alert
geniality
of
the
benign
magician
who
is
sometimes
constrained
to
weave
black
spells
because
that
is
a
part
of
the
game
and
in
the
day
s
work
as
it
were
but
who
puts
his
heart
only
into
the
weaving
of
spells
that
are
this
is
perhaps
why
feuillet
s
nice
people
nearly
always
take
flesh
and
live
and
breathe
his
horrid
people
hardly
resemblance
between
him
and
the
writer
of
the
nice
women
with
their
lovers
who
step
so
daintily
through
his
pages
to
the
flutter
of
perfumed
fans
and
the
rustle
of
fine
silks
are
as
convincing
as
the
palpitantly
convincing
princesses
of
hans
andersen
and
grimm
but
feuillet
s
villains
and
adventuresses
like
the
ogres
and
the
witches
we
never
very
heartily
believe
in
are
for
the
most
part
the
merest
stereotypes
of
vice
and
wickedness
always
artificial
too
often
a
trifle
absurd
in
de
for
example
we
have
an
elaborate
study
of
a
man
who
has
determined
to
live
by
the
succinct
principle
evil
be
thou
my
good
succinct
enough
principle
in
all
conscience
though
feuillet
requires
a
lengthy
chapter
and
a
suicide
to
enunciate
it
the
idea
if
not
original
might
in
some
hands
lend
itself
to
interesting
development
but
not
so
in
feuillet
s
from
the
threshold
we
feel
that
he
is
handicapped
by
his
theme
it
hangs
round
his
neck
like
the
of
the
adage
it
checks
his
artistic
impulses
obscures
his
artistic
instincts
the
quips
and
cranks
the
wreathed
smiles
of
feuillet
the
humourist
were
out
of
place
in
a
stupendous
epopee
of
this
sort
so
for
the
sake
of
a
psychological
abstraction
which
hasn
t
even
the
poor
merit
of
novelty
we
must
look
on
ruefully
while
our
merryman
divested
of
cap
and
bells
proses
to
the
end
of
his
four
sad
hundred
pages
there
are
novelists
who
must
work
with
an
abstraction
who
can
see
their
characters
and
their
incidents
only
as
they
illustrate
an
abstraction
and
these
also
achieve
their
effects
and
earn
their
rewards
but
feuillet
belongs
in
a
different
galley
a
handful
of
human
nature
a
pleasing
countryside
and
paris
in
the
are
his
materials
the
philosophy
and
the
plot
may
come
as
they
will
and
it
really
doesn
t
much
matter
if
they
never
come
at
all
to
give
feuillet
a
subject
is
to
attach
a
chain
and
ball
to
his
pen
he
is
never
so
debonair
so
sympathetic
so
satisfying
a
writer
as
when
he
has
something
just
short
of
nothing
to
write
about
in
de
he
has
a
tremendous
deal
to
write
about
his
subject
weighs
his
pen
to
the
earth
the
result
is
a
book
that
s
a
monstrosity
and
a
protagonist
who
s
a
monster
louis
de
camors
is
as
truly
a
monster
as
any
green
dragon
that
ever
spat
fire
or
stole
king
s
daughters
though
by
no
means
so
exciting
a
monster
and
he
hasn
t
even
the
virtue
of
being
a
monster
that
hangs
together
for
while
we
are
asked
to
think
of
him
as
destitute
of
natural
affections
he
is
at
the
same
time
shown
to
us
as
the
fond
idolater
of
his
wife
his
wife
s
mother
and
his
son
on
his
son
s
account
indeed
he
goes
so
far
as
to
spend
a
long
cold
night
in
a
damp
and
uncomfortable
wood
only
to
be
dismissed
in
the
morning
without
the
embrace
in
the
hope
of
gaining
which
he
has
violated
his
philosophy
and
taken
the
chances
of
rheumatism
altogether
a
man
devoid
of
affections
who
loves
his
son
his
wife
and
his
may
be
regarded
as
doing
pretty
well
again
since
we
are
on
the
chapter
of
inconsistencies
in
that
dreary
and
pompous
letter
written
to
louis
by
his
father
which
expounds
the
text
of
what
becomes
the
son
s
rule
of
conduct
he
is
gravely
charged
to
fling
religion
and
morality
out
of
the
window
but
to
cherish
honour
as
it
were
his
life
it
is
clear
that
a
materialist
can
t
be
a
saint
but
he
can
be
a
gentleman
and
that
is
something
complacently
writes
the
elder
comte
de
camors
louis
however
though
he
makes
loud
acts
of
faith
in
this
inexpensive
gospel
never
hesitates
to
betray
his
friend
to
seduce
the
wife
of
his
benefactor
nor
to
marry
an
unsuspecting
child
who
loves
him
for
the
sheer
purpose
of
screening
an
intrigue
with
another
lady
which
he
still
intends
to
carry
on
feuillet
perhaps
saves
his
face
by
heaping
upon
this
impossible
being
s
head
all
the
punishments
that
are
poetically
due
to
crime
but
he
doesn
t
save
de
it

a
dismal

uncommonly
hard
to

it
is

most
captivating

listen
to
her
artless
pronouncement
upon
monsieur
s
evangel
of
honour
mon

she
says
i
m
not
sure
but
it
seems
to
me
that
honour
apart
from
morality
is
nothing
very
great
and
that
morality
apart
from
religion
is
nothing
at
all
it
s
like
a
chain
honour
hangs
in
the
last
link
like
a
flower
but
when
the
chain
is
broken
the
flower
falls
with
the
rest
if
however
feuillet
s
villains
are
failures
his
adventuresses
and
bad
women
are
grotesquer
failures
still
and
no
wonder
his
reluctance
to
fashion
an
ugly
thing
out
of
material
that
would
in
the
natural
course
of
his
impressions
suggest
to
him
none
but
ideas
of

is
quite
enough
to
account
for
it
octave
feuillet
is
too
much
a
gentleman
too
much
a
to
be
able
to
get
any
intellectual
understanding
of
a
bad
woman
the
actual
operations
of
a
bad
woman

soul
are
things

can
get
no
realizing

up

even
at

never

to

through

naughtiness

can

feuillet
the
wit
and
the
man
of
the
world
knows
this
as
well
as
we
do
and
knowing
it
he
tries
by
verbal
to
make
us
forget

reminds
me
of
a
sorceress
says
some
one
of
sabine
tallevaut
do
you
notice
she
walks
without
a
sound
her
feet
scarcely
touch
the
walks
like
a
lady
macbeth
it
is
the
old
trick
the
traditional
of
the
showman
but
not
all
the
in
feuillet
s
sack
can
make
us
believe
in
sabine
tallevaut
one
can
recognise
feuillet
s
bad
women
too
by
the
uncanny
influence
they
immediately
cast
upon
his
men
more
taciturn
than
ever
absent
strange
as
if
she
were
meditating
some
profound
design
all
at
once
she
seemed
to
wake
she
lifted
her
long
lashes
let
her
blue
eyes
wander
here
and
there
and
suddenly
looked
straight
at
camors
who
was
conscious
of
a
thrill
is
how
mme
de
campvallon
does
it
and
the
fact
is
conclusive
so
far
as
her
moral
character
is
in
question
none
of
feuillet
s
good
women
would
ever
dream
of
making
a
man
thrill
at
her
first
encounter
with
him
but
feuillet
s
bad
women
will
stop
at
nothing
julia
de
trécoeur
takes
her
own
a
plain
stout
prosaic
country
gentleman
and
throws
him
into
a
paroxysm
that
has
to
be
expressed
in
this
wise
it
was
a
mad
intoxication
which
the
savour
of
guilt
only
intensified
duty
loyalty
honour
whatsoever
presented
itself
as
an
obstacle
to
his
passion

but
exasperate
its
fury
the
pagan

bitten
him
in
the
heart
and
injected
her
poisons
a
vision
of
julia

fatal
beauty
was
present
without
surcease
in
his
burning
brain
before
his
troubled
eyes
avidly
in
spite
of
himself
he
drank
in
her
languors
her
perfumes
her
breath
de
has
sometimes
been
called
feuillet
s
one
eminent
critic
remarks
that
in
writing
it
feuillet
dived
into
the
vast
ocean
of
human
nature
and
brought
up
a
pearl
well
there
are
pearls
and
pearls
there
are
real
pearls
and
artificial
pearls
there
are
white
pearls
and
black
pearls
it
might
seem
to
some
of
us
that
de
is
an
artificial
black
one
frankly
as
a
piece
of
literature
the
novel
is
just
in
three
words
a
fairly
good
melodrama
julia
herself
is
the
proper
melodramatic
heroine
her
beauty
is
fatal
her
passions
are
ungovernable
and
she
dearly
loves
a
scene
now
she
contemplates
retirement
into
a
convent
now
matrimony
now
a
leap
from
the
cliffs
and
each
change
of
mood
is
inevitably
the
occasion
for
much
ranting
and
much
attitudinizing
her
history
is
a
fairly
good
melodrama
that
it
is
not
a
melodrama
is
due
to
the
circumstance
that
feuillet
was
too
intelligent
a
man
to
be
able
to
make
it
so
he
can
t
keep
out
his
wit
and
every
now
and
again
his
melodrama
forgets
itself
and
becomes
sane
comedy
he
can
t
keep
out
his
touches
of
things
simple
and
human
the
unhuman
remainder
suffers
from
the
contrast
why
one
wonders
with
his
flair
for
the
subtleties
of
the
normal
with
his
genius
for
extracting
their
charm
from
trifles
why
should
feuillet
have
turned
his
hand
to
melodrama
at
all
is
it
partly
because
he
lived
in
and
wrote
for
a
highly
melodramatic
the
dear
good
days
of
the
dear
bad
second
empire
partly
too
no
doubt
because
as
some
one
has
said
the
artist
can
never
forgive
though
he
can
easily
forget
his
limitations
like
the
comic
actor
who
will
not
be
happy
till
he
has
appeared
as
hamlet
the
novelist
also
will
cherish
his
unreasoning
aspirations
and
then
melodrama
is
achieved
before
you
know
it
any
incident
that
is
not
in
itself
essentially
will
become
melodramatic
when
you
try
to
treat
it
it
will
become
forced
and
stagey
if
dramatic
incidents
are
not
the
spontaneous
issue
of
your
talent
dramatic
incidents
are
far
from
being
the
spontaneous
issue
of
feuillet
s
talent
they
are
its
changelings
his
talent
is
all
preoccupied
in
fathering
children
of
a
quite
opposite
complexion
style
suavity
elegance
sentiment
colour
are
feuillet
s
preoccupations
action
incident
are
when
necessary
necessary
evils
so
his
action
when
he
is
at
his
best
loiters
saunters
or
even
stops
until
suddenly
he
remembers
that
after
all
his
story
must
some
time
reach
its
period
and
that
something
really
must
happen
to
advance
it
thereupon
hurriedly
perfunctorily
carelessly
he
knocks
off
a
few
pages
of
incident
fast
and
will
as
likely
as
not
read
like
the
of
a
play
at
the
adelphi
that
absurd
sabine
tallevaut
whose
feet
scarcely
touch
the
earth
with
poison
in
her
hand
and
adultery
in
her
heart
is
the
one
disfigurement
upon
what
might
otherwise
have
been
feuillet
s
most
nearly
perfect
picture
in
spite
of
her
remains
a
work
of
exquisite
and
tender
beauty
and
i
m
not
sure
whether
aliette
de
vaudricourt
isn
t
the
very
queen
of
all
his
women
if
feuillet
was
too
much
a
gentleman
to
be
able
to
paint
a
bad
woman
he
was
too
much
a
man
not
to
revel
in
painting
a
charming
one
as
we
pass
through
his
gallery
of
delightful
heroines
from
aliette
de

to
clothilde

lucan
to
mme
de
técle
marie
fitzgerald
miss
mary
de
camors
marguerite
laroque
even
to
jeanne
de
maurescamp
we
can
feel
the
man
s
admiration
pulsing
in
every
stroke
of
the
artist
s
brush
he
takes
the
woman
s
point
of
view
espouses
her
side
of
the
quarrel
offers
himself
as
her
champion
wherever
he
finds
that
a
champion
is
needed
and
he
sticks
to
his
allegiance
even
after
as
in
the
case
of
jeanne
de
maurescamp
she
might
seem
to
have
forfeited
her
claim
to
it
of
jeanne
he
can
still
bring
himself
to
say
at
the
end
of
histoire
d
une
decidedly
this
angel
had
become
a
monster
but
the
lesson
of
her
story
is
that
in
the
moral
order
no
one
is
born
a
monster
god
makes
no
monsters
it
is
man
who
makes
them
in
this
instance
however
feuillet
is
perhaps
rather
the
apologist
than
the
champion
his
contention
is
that
jeanne
was
by
nature
virtuous
and
that
her
virtue
has
been
destroyed
by
the
stupidity
and
the
brutality
of
her
husband
but
feuillet
has
too
fine
and
too
judicious
a
wit
to
insist
upon
the
note
of
strenuousness
seeing
the
woman
s
point
of
view
he
sees
its
humours
as
well
as
its
pathos
admitting
that
men
for
the
most
part
are
grossly
unworthy
of
her
and
that
woman
has
infinitely
the
worst
of
it
in
the
arrangements
of
society
admitting
and
deploring
it
he
doesn
t
profess
to
know
how
to
set
it
right
he
has
no
practical
reform
to
preach
his
business
is
to
divert
us
and
if
he
must
be
serious
to
be
serious
gaily
and
charmingly
and
perhaps
he
is
most
serious
not
when
composing
an
epitaph
for
jeanne
de
maurescamp
but
when
he
is
lightly
saying
in
the
person
of
the
comtesse
jules
always
remember
my
poor
dear
that
women
are
born
to
men
to
be
suffered
charmingly
serious
himself
feuillet
s
heroines
likewise
are
always
serious
in
their
different
charming
ways
they
may
be
wilful
and
capricious
like
marguerite
laroque
or
fond
of
the
excitements
of
the
world
like
mme
de
rias
or
wise
in
their
generation
like
mme
de
la
veyle
but
they
are
always
womanly
and
human
at
the
of
the
heart
and
they
are
almost
always
religious
a
sceptic
scepticlike
feuillet
utterly
discountenances
scepticism
in
woman
even
his
most
recusant
of
masculine
unbelievers
the
vicomte
de
vaudricourt
proclaims
his
preference
for
a
pious
wife
not
of
course
he
says
that
i
exaggerate
the
moral
guarantees
offered
by
piety
or
that
i
mistake
it
for
a
synonym
of
virtue
but
still
it
is
certain
that
with
women
the
idea
of
duty
is
rarely
dissociated
from
religious
ideas
because
religion
doesn
t
keep
all
of
them
straight
it
is
an
error
to
conclude
that
it
keeps
none
of
them
straight
and
it
s
always
well
to
be
on
the
safe
side
elsewhere
feuillet
gives
us
his
notion
of
the
moral
outlook
of
the
woman
who
is
not
religious
evil
for
her
he
tells
us
ceases
to
be
evil
and
becomes
simply
tis
a
very
mannish
a
very
frenchmannish
way
of
viewing
the
thing
one
has
sometimes
heard
it
maintained
that
only
women
can
reveal
themselves
with
perfect
grace
in
a
form
so
intimate
as
letters
or
a
diary
that
a
man
s
hand
is
apt
to
be
too
heavy
his
manner
too
perhaps
it
is
feuillet
s
sympathy
with
women
that
has
made
him
the
dab
he
is
at
this
womanly
art
in
for
instance
we
learn
vastly
more
of
bernard
s
character
from
his
diary
than
we
should
from
thrice
the
number
of
pages
of
exposition
the
letters
from
marie
to
her
mother
in
de
furnish
the
single
element
of
relief
in
that
lugubrious
composition
even
those
that
pass
between
rias
and
mme
de
lorris
in
mariage
dans
le
their
is
sufficiently
depressing
though
the
man
is
an
egotistical
cad
and
the
great
lady
who
is
giving
him
her
help
and
pity
ought
rather
to
despise
and
spurn
exceedingly
good
and
natural
letters
and
the
letter
from
mme
de
rias
to
kévern
which
ends
the
book
is
a
very
jewel
of
a
letter
but
it
is
in
the
diary
of
his
poor
young
man
that
feuillet
s
command
of
the
first
person
singular
attains
its
most
completely
satisfying
results
roman
d
un
jeune
homme
is
a
tale
of
youth
for
the
young
and
the
eldest
of
us
may
count
himself
still
young
if
he
can
still
enjoy
it
here
we
have
romance
pure
and
simple
a
thing
of
glamour
all
compact
and
the
that
so
definitely
separates
romance
from
absurdity
yet
leaves
them
so
perilously
near
together
is
never
crossed
the
action
passes
in
the
country
and
in
the
most
delectable
sort
of
country
at
country
of
the
appreciative
and
imaginative
cit
before
all
things
a
parisian
feuillet
is
never
particularly
happy
in
presenting
paris
his
paris
is
correct
enough
in
architecture
and
topography
no
doubt
but
the
spirit
of
paris
the
whatever
it
is
which
makes
paris
paris
and
not
merely
a
large
town
somehow
evades
him
possibly
he
knew
his
paris
too
well
familiarity
had
bred
a
kind
of
inability
to
see
to
focus
a
kind
of
staleness
anyhow
it
is
when
he
gets
away
from
paris
that
he
wakes
to
the
opportuneness
and
the
opportunities
of
scenic
backgrounds
his
eye
stale
to
town
is
now
all
eagerness
all
freshness
impressions
of
beauty
crowd
upon
him
he
sees
the
country
as
it
is
doubtful
whether
the
countryman
ever
sees
countryman
who
has
been
surfeited
with
it
who
has
long
since
forgotten
its
first
magical
effect
he
brings
to
the
country
the
sensitiveness
which
is
the
product
of
the
city
s
heat
and
strife
dew
and
wild
flowers
the
green
of
grass
and
trees
the
music
of
birds
the
flutter
of
their
wings
the
pure
air
the
wide
prospects
the
changing
is
to
the
appreciative
and
imaginative
townsman
that
these
speak
their
finest
message
but
feuillet
is
more
than
a
townsman
he
is
a
teller
of
to
him
the
country
is
a
free
playground
for
his
fancy
there
beautiful
ladies
and
gallant
knights
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
love
and
to
sing
and
there
without
destroying
our
illusion
he
can
leave
them
to
live
happily
forever
after
the
brittany
in
which
maxime
and
marguerite
meet
and
misunderstand
and
woo
and
wed
is
not
that
northwestern
corner
of
france
that
one
can
reach
in
a
few
hours
by
steamer
from
southampton
it
is
a
brittany
of
fairy
woods
and
streams
and
castles
that
never
was
save
in
the
poet
s
dream
for
if
others
of
feuillet
s
novels
have
been
only
in
part
or
only
rather
like
the
of
a
poor
young
is
a
wholly
and
absolutely
the
personages
of
the
story
are
the
invariable
personages
of
the
the
prince
disguised
as
a
in
the
marquis
de
champcey
disguised
as
a
the
haughty
princess
who
will
not
love
yet
loves
despite
her
will
and
is
rewarded
by
the
s
appearing
in
all
the
prince
s
splendour
at
the
proper
time
in
marguerite
laroque
the
bad
prince
and
the
bad
princess
in
de
bévallon
and
mlle
hélouin
the
good
magician
in
laubépin
and
the
delightfullest
of
conceivable
fairy
godmothers
in
mlle
de
porhoët
and
the
progress
of
the
story
is
the
wonted
progress
of
the
there
is
hardship
but
it
is
overcome
there
are
perils
but
they
are
turned
misconceptions
but
they
are
cleared
up
there
are
empty
pockets
but
there
is
the
bag
of
gold
waiting
to
fill
them
the
marvellous
never
shocks
our
credulity
the
coincidences
seem
the
most
natural
happenings
in
the
world
we
are
not
in
the
least
surprised
when
at
the
right
moment
the
bag
of
gold
appears
at
maxime
s
feet
enabling
him
to
marry
it
is
the
foregone
consequence
of
his
having
a
fairy
godmother
we
don
t
even
raise
the
eyebrow
of
doubt
when
the
laroques
contemplate
relinquishing
their
fortune
to
the
poor
so
that
marguerite
may
come
to
her
lover
that
is
the
accepted
device
of
the
for
administering
to
the
proud
princess
her
humiliation
in
one
small
detail
only
does
the
teller
lose
himself
and
let
the
novelist
supplant
him
that
is
where
he
implies
that
the
bad
prince
and
princess
after
their
wicked
wiles
had
been
discovered
took
the
train
to
paris
they
did
nothing
of
the
sort
they
were
turned
into
blocks
of
stone
and
condemned
to
look
on
at
the
happiness
of
the
good
prince
and
princess
from
the
terrace
of
the
château
de
laroque
but
it
must
not
be
supposed
because
the
personages
of
the
of
a
poor
young
are
personages
that
therefore
they
are
not
human
personages
it
is
on
the
contrary
the
humanity
of
its
personages
that
makes
your
interesting
you
stick
to
human
men
and
women
you
merely
more
or
less
improve
the
conditions
of
their
existence
you
merely
revise
and
amend
a
little
the
laws
of
the
external
easy
thing
to
do
in
spite
of
the
unthinking
people
who
prate
of
those
laws
as
immutable
then
the
fun
consists
in
seeing
how
human
nature
will
persist
and
react
surely
none
of
feuillet
s
heroines
is
more
engagingly
human
than
marguerite
laroque
it
is
true
that
we
see
her
only
through
the
eyes
of
a
chronicler
who
happens
to
be
infatuated
with
her
but
we
know
what
discount
to
allow
for
that
we
are
confident
from
her
first
entrance
that
if
as
we
hope
our
poor
young
man
s
head
is
screwed
on
as
poor
young
men
s
heads
should
be
marguerite
will
turn
it
we
learn
that
she
is
capricious
therefore
maxime
will
be
constant
that
she
is
proud
therefore
in
all
humility
he
will
be
prouder
that
she
is
humble
therefore
in
all
pride
he
will
humble
himself
at
her
feet
but
antecedent
to
all
this
and
just
because
his
ostensible
business
in
brittany
is
the
management
of
the
laroques
estate
no
one
needs
to
warn
us
that
his
real
business
will
be
the
conquest
of
the
laroques
daughter
we
can
foresee
with
half
an
eye
that
the
affairs
of
the
estate
are
affairs
which
our
disguised
marquis
will
conscientiously
neglect
indeed
mme
laroque
herself
seems
to
have
been
haunted
by
something
of
the
same
premonition
what
does
she
say
to
the
mon
dieu

un

inconcevable
nous
pensons
que

quelque
prince

bien
que

est
un

mais
vraiment
c
est
un
homme
she
might
have
added
un
homme
for
if
we
have
a
fault
to
find
with
maxime
it
is
that
he
seems
just
possibly
a
thought
too
digne
but
that
is
a
fault
common
to
so
many
men
in
fiction
french
novelists
like
english
lady
novelists
are
terribly
apt
to
make
their
men
too
digne
they
don
t
make
them
too
unspeakably
maxime
however
we
mustn
t
forget
is
his
own
portraitist
and
we
ll
hope
in
this
detail
the
portrait
errs
for
the
rest
we
are
content
to
accept
it
as
he
paints
it
he
is
a
poor
young
man
but
he
is
also
a
fairy
prince
therefore
he
can
vaunt
himself
as
an
ordinary
poor
young
man
could
hardly
do
with
taste
he
can
perform
and
narrate
his
prodigies
of
skill
and
valour
without
offending
he
can
rescue
an
enormous
newfoundland
dog
from
a
raging
torrent
for
example
with
the
greatest
ease
in
the
world
an
exploit
you
or
i
might
have
found
ticklish
and
he
can
tell
us
of
it
afterward
a
proceeding
you
or
i
might
have
shrunk
from
as
vainglorious
for
maxime

a
fairy
prince
the
dog
belongs
to
the
fairy
princess
and
the
bad
prince
the
rival
who
is
standing
by
doesn
t
know
how
to
swim
again
with
splendid
indifference
he
can
accomplish
and
record
his
leap
from
the
tour
d
elven
to
save
the
fairy
princess
from
a
situation
that
might
in
fairyland
have
compromised
her
hadn
t
the
princess
unjustly
impugned
his
honour
and
insinuated
that
the
situation
was
one
he
had
deliberately
brought
to
pass

we
can
see
her
kindling
eye
the
scornful
curl
of
her
lip
we
can
hear
the
disdainful
tremor
of
her
voice
maxime
would
be
a
poor
young
man
indeed
if
after
that
he
should
hesitate
to
jump
and

his
immediate
compensation

cries
the
haughty
princess
now
all
remorse

so
that
though
the
prince
goes
away
with
a
broken
arm
the
lover
carries
exultancy
in
his
heart
is
maxime
perhaps
just
a
thought
too
digne
also
in
his
relations

visits

at

for
instance
and
promises
to
convey
the

deserving

fairy

blurts

remains
human

throughout

somewhat
embarrassing

in
their
subsequent
proceedings

adopted
him

from

we
must
remember

mortal

the
hands

french
novelist

to
choose
between
that
and

career
of
profligacy

born
at
in
the
department
of
the
manche

the
of
august
his
father

belonged
to
one
of
the
oldest
norman
families
was
to
the
prefect
and
a
little
later
in
the
revolution
of
played
a
prominent
part
in
politics
a
hereditary
nervousness
amounting
finally
to
a
disease
alone
prevented
him
according
to
guizot
from
being
given
a
portfolio
in
the
new
ministry
octave
inherited
his
father
s
excessive
sensibility
although
in
later
years
he
held
it
more
under
control
after
the
death
of
his
mother
which
occurred
as
he
was
developing
in
boyhood
he
became
so
melancholy
that
at
the
advice
of
the
physicians
he
was
sent
to
a
school
in
paris
where
his
health
gradually
became
afterward
at
the
collège
de
he
greatly
distinguished
himself
as
a
scholar
it
was
his
father
s
design
to
prepare
him
for
the
diplomatic
career
but
already
the
desire
to
write
had
awakened
itself
in
him
when
the
moment
came
for
choosing
a
profession
octave
timidly
confessed
his
determination
to
make
literature
his
business
in
life
the
irascible
old
gentleman
at
turned
him
out
of
the
house
and
cut
off
his
allowance
he
returned
to
paris
and
for
three
years
had
a
hard
struggle
with
poverty
during
this
time
under
the
encouragement
of
the
great
actor
bocage
octave
feuillet
brought
out
three
dramas
échec
et
mat
palma
and
la
vieillesse
de
richelieu
under
the
pseudonym
of
désiré
hazard
these
were
successful
and
the
playwright
s
father
forgave
and
welcomed
him
back
to
his
favour
octave
remained
in
paris
actively
engaged
in
literary
work
mainly
dramatic
but
gradually
in
the
line
of
prose
fiction
also
in
he
published
his
novel
of
polichinelle
followed
in
by
onesta
in
by
redemption
and
in
by
bellah
none
of
these
are
remembered
among
octave
feuillet
s
best
works
but
he
was
gaining
skill
and
care
in
composition
in
however
he
was
suddenly
summoned
home
to
by
the
increased
melancholy
of
his
father
who
could
no
longer
safely
be
left
alone
in
the
gloomy
ancestral
mansion
which
he
refused
to
leave
octave
with
resignation
determined
to
sacrifice
his
life
to
the
care
of
his
father
and
in
this
piety
he
was
supported
by
his
charming
cousin
valérie
feuillet
a
very
accomplished
and
devoted
woman
whom
he
married
in
for
eight
years
they
shared
this
painful
exile
the
father
of
octave
scarcely
permitting
them
to
leave
his
sight
and
refusing
every
other
species
of
society
strangely
enough
this
imprisonment
was
not
unfavourable
to
the
novelist
s
genius
the
books
he
wrote
during
this
dalila
la
petite
comtesse
le
village
and
finally
le
roman
d
un
jeune
homme
pauvre
not
only
far
superior
to
what
he
had
previously
published
but
among
the
very
finest
of
all
his
works
by
a
grim
coincidence
on
almost
the
only
occasion
on
which
octave
feuillet
ventured
to
absent
himself
for
a
day
or
two
to
be
present
at
the
performance
of
his
roman
d
un
jeune
homme
pauvre
when
it
was
dramatized
in
the
father
suddenly
died
while
the
son
was
in
paris
this
was
a
great
shock
to
feuillet
who
bitterly
and
unjustly
condemned
himself
he
was
now
however
free
and
with
his
wife
and
children
he
returned
to
paris
he
was
now
very
successful
and
soon
became
a
figure
at
compiègne
and
in
the
great
world
in
he
published
sibylle
and
was
elected
a
member
of
the
french
academy
a
great
favourite
of
the
emperor
and
empress
he
was
tempted
to
combine
the
social
life
at
court
with
the
labours
of
literature
his
health
began
to
suffer
from
the
strain
and
to
recover
he
retired
again
to
where
he
lived
not
in
the
home
of
his
ancestors
but
in
a
little
house
above
the
ramparts
called
les
paillers
for
the
future
he
spent
only
the
winter
months
in
paris
his
novels
became
fewer
but
not
less
carefully
prepared
he
enjoyed
a
veritable
triumph
with
monsieur
de
camors
in
next
year
he
was
appointed
royal
librarian
at
fontainbleu
an
office
which
he
held
till
the
fall
of
the
empire
he
then
retired
to
les
paillers
again
where
he
had
written
julia
de
trécoeur
in
the
end
of
his
life
was
troubled
by
domestic
bereavement
and
loss
of
health
he
hurried
restlessly
from
place
to
place
a
prey
to
constant
nervous
agitation
his
later
writings
were
numerous
but
had
not
the
vitality
of
those
previously
mentioned
octave
feuillet
died
in
paris
december
and
was
succeeded
at
the
french
academy
by
pierre
loti
octave
was
the
type
of
a
sensitive
somewhat
melancholy
fine
gentleman
he
was
very
elegant
in
manners
reserved
and
ceremonious
in
society
where
he
held
himself
somewhat
remote
in
the
radiance
of
his
delicate
wit
but
within
the
bosom
of
his
family
he
was
tenderly
and
almost
pathetically
demonstrative
the
least
criticism
was
torture
to
him
and
it
is
said
that
when
his
comedy
of
la
belle
au
bois
dormant
was
hissed
off
the
boards
of
the
vaudeville
in
for
three
weeks
afterward
the
life
of
feuillet
was
in
danger
fortunately
however
for
a
fiery
particle
so
sensitive
the
greater
part
of
his
career
was
one
continuous
triumph

paris
the
second
evening
i
have
passed
in
this
miserable
room
staring
gloomily
at
the
bare
hearth
hearing
the
dull
monotone
of
the
street
and
feeling
more
lonely
more
forsaken
and
nearer
to
despair
in
the
heart
of
this
great
city
than
a
man
shivering
on
a
broken
plank
in
i
have
done
with
cowardice
i
will
look
my
destiny
in
the
face
till
it
loses
its
spectral
air
i
will
open
my
sorrowful
heart
to
the
one
confidant
whose
pity
will
not
hurt
to
that
pale
last
friend
who
looks
back
at
me
from
the
glass
i
will
write
down
my
thoughts
and
my
life
not
in
trivial
and
childish
detail
but
without
serious
omissions
and
above
all
without
lies
i
shall
love
my
journal
it
will
be
a
brotherly
echo
to
cheat
my
loneliness
and
at
the
same
time
a
second
conscience
warning
me
not
to
allow
anything
to
enter
into
my
life
which
i
dare
not
write
down
calmly
with
my
own
hand
now
with
sad
eagerness
i
search
the
past
for
the
facts
and
incidents
which
should
have
long
since
enlightened
me
had
not
filial
respect
habit
and
the
indifference
of
a
happy
idler
blinded
me
i
understand
now
my
mother
s
deep
and
constant
melancholy
i
understand
her
distaste
for
society
and
why
she
wore
that
plain
unvaried
dress
which
sometimes
called
forth
sarcasms
sometimes
wrath
from
my
you
look
like
a
servant
he
would
say
to
her
i
could
not
but
be
conscious
that
our
family
life
was
broken
by
more
serious
quarrels
though
i
was
never
an
actual
witness
of
them
all
i
heard
were
my
father
s
sharp
and
imperious
tones
the
murmur
of
a
pleading
voice
and
stifled
sobs
these
outbursts
i
attributed
to
my
father
s
violent
and
fruitless
attempts
to
revive
in
my
mother
the
taste
for
the
elegant
and
brilliant
life
which
she
had
once
enjoyed
as
much
as
becomes
a
virtuous
woman
but
into
which
she
now
accompanied
my
father
with
a
repugnance
that
grew
stronger
every
day
after
such
crises
my
father
nearly
always
ran
off
to
buy
some
costly
trinket
which
my
mother
found
in
her
at
dinner
and
never
wore
one
day
in
the
middle
of
winter
she
received
a
large
box
of
rare
flowers
from
paris
she
thanked
my
father
warmly
but
directly
he
had
left
the
room
i
saw
her
slightly
raise
her
shoulders
and
look
up
to
heaven
with
an
expression
of
hopeless
despair
during
my
childhood
and
early
youth
i
had
a
great
respect
for
my
father
but
not
much
affection
indeed
throughout
this
period
i
saw
only
the
sombre
side
of
his
one
side
that
showed
itself
in
domestic
life
for
which
he
was
not
fitted
later
when
i
was
old
enough
to
go
out
with
him
i
was
surprised
and
charmed
to
find
in
him
a
person
perfectly
new
to
me
it
seemed
as
if
in
our
old
family
house
he
felt
himself
constrained
by
some
fatal
spell
once
beyond
its
doors
his
forehead
cleared
his
chest
expanded
and
he
was
young
again
now
maxime
he
would
cry
now
for
a
gallop
and
joyously
we
would
rush
along
his
shouts
of
youthful
pleasure
his
enthusiasm
his
fantastic
wit
his
bursts
of
feeling
charmed
my
young
heart
and
i
longed
to
bring
something
of
all
this
back
to
my
poor
mother
forgotten
in
her
corner
at
home
i
began
to
love
my
father
and
when
i
saw
all
the
sympathetic
qualities
of
his
brilliant
nature
displayed
in
all
the
functions
of
social
hunts
and
races
balls
and
fondness
for
him
became
an
actual
admiration
a
perfect
horseman
a
dazzling
talker
a
bold
gambler
daring
and
he
became
for
me
the
finished
type
of
manly
grace
and
chivalrous
nobility
indeed
he
would
speak
of
with
some
the
last
of
the
gentlemen
such
was
my
father
in
society
but
as
soon
as
he
returned
to
his
home
my
mother
and
i
saw
only
a
restless
morose
and
violent
old
man
my
father
s
outbursts
to
a
creature
so
sweet
and
delicate
as
my
mother
would
certainly
have
revolted
me
had
they
not
been
followed
by
the
quick
returns
of
tenderness
and
the
redoubled
attentions
i
have
mentioned
justified
in
my
eyes
by
these
proofs
of
penitence
my
father
seemed
to
be
only
a
naturally
kind
man
sometimes
irritated
beyond
endurance
by
an
obstinate
and
systematic
opposition
to
all
his
tastes
and
preferences
i
thought
my
mother
was
suffering
from
some
nervous
derangement
my
father
gave
me
to
understand
so
though
and
as
i
thought
very
properly
he
only
referred
to
this
subject
with
great
reserve
i
could
not
understand
what
were
my
mother
s
feelings
towards
my
father
they
analysis
or
definition
sometimes
a
strange
severity
glittered
in
the
looks
she
fixed
on
him
but
it
was
only
a
flash
and
the
next
moment
her
beautiful
soft
eyes
and
her
unchanged
face
showed
nothing
but
tender
devotion
and
passionate
submission
my
mother
had
been
married
at
fifteen
and
i
was
nearly
when
my
sister
my
poor
hélène
was
born
one
morning
soon
afterwards
my
father
came
out
of
my
mother
s
room
looking
anxious
he
signed
to
me
to
follow
him
into
the
garden
maxime
he
said
after
walking
in
silence
for
a
little
your
mother
gets
stranger
and
stranger
she
is
so
ill
just
now
father
yes
of
course
but
now
she
has
the
oddest
fancy
she
wants
you
to
study
law
law
what
does
my
mother
want
me
at
my
age
with
my
birth
and
position
to
sit
among
on
the
forms
of
a
college
classroom
it
is
absurd
so
i
think
said
my
father
dryly
but
your
mother
is
ill
s
no
more
to
be
said
i
was
a
young
puppy
then
puffed
up
by
my
name
my
importance
and
my
little
successes
but
i
was
sound
at
heart
and
i
worshipped
my
mother
with
whom
i
had
lived
for
twenty
years
in
the
closest
intimacy
possible
between
two
human
souls
i
hastened
to
assure
her
of
my
obedience
she
thanked
me
with
a
sad
smile
and
made
me
kiss
my
sister
who
was
sleeping
on
her
lap
we
lived
about
a
mile
and
a
half
from
grenoble
so
i
could
attend
the
law
classes
at
the
university
without
leaving
home
day
by
day
my
mother
followed
my
progress
with
such
intense
and
persistent
interest
that
i
could
not
help
thinking
that
she
had
some
stronger
motive
than
the
fancy
of
an
invalid
that
perhaps
my
father
s
hatred
and
contempt
for
the
practical
and
tedious
side
of
life
might
have
brought
about
a
certain
embarrassment
in
our
affairs
which
my
mother
thought
a
knowledge
of
law
and
a
business
training
would
enable
me
to
put
right
this
explanation
did
not
satisfy
me
no
doubt
my
father
had
often
complained
bitterly
of
our
losses
during
the
revolution
but
his
complaints
had
long
ceased
and
i
had
never
thought
them
because
as
far
as
i
could
see
our
position
was
in
every
way
satisfactory
we
lived
near
grenoble
in
our
hereditary
château
which
was
famous
in
our
country
as
an
aristocratic
and
lordly
dwelling
my
father
and
i
have
often
shot
or
hunted
for
a
whole
day
without
going
off
our
own
land
or
out
of
our
own
woods
our
stables
were
vast
and
filled
with
expensive
horses
of
which
my
father
was
very
fond
and
very
proud
besides
we
had
a
in
paris
on
the
boulevard
des
capucines
where
comfortable
quarters
were
always
reserved
for
occasional
visits
and
nothing
in
our
ordinary
way
of
living
could
suggest
either
a
small
income
or
close
management
even
as
regards
the
table
my
father
insisted
upon
a
particular
degree
of
delicacy
and
refinement
my
mother
s
health
declined
almost
imperceptibly
in
time
there
came
an
alteration
in
her
disposition
the
mouth
which
at
all
events
in
my
presence
had
spoken
only
kind
words
grew
bitter
and
aggressive
every
step
i
took
beyond
the
house
provoked
a
sarcasm
my
father
was
not
spared
and
bore
these
attacks
with
a
patience
that
seemed
to
me
exemplary
but
he
got
more
and
more
into
the
habit
of
living
away
from
home
he
told
me
that
he
must
have
distraction
and
amusement
he
always
wanted
me
to
go
with
him
and
my
love
of
pleasure
and
the
eagerness
of
youth
and
to
speak
truly
my
lack
of
moral
courage
made
me
obey
him
too
readily
in
september
there
were
some
races
near
the
château
and
several
of
my
father
s
horses
were
to
run
we
started
early
and
lunched
on
the
course
about
the
middle
of
the
day
as
i
was
riding
by
the
course
watching
the
fortunes
of
a
race
one
of
our
men
came
up
and
said
he
had
been
looking
for
me
for
more
than
half
an
hour
he
added
that
my
father
had
already
been
sent
for
and
had
gone
back
to
my
mother
at
the
château
and
that
he
wanted
me
to
follow
him
at
once
but
what
in
heaven
s
name
is
the
matter
i
think
madame
is
worse
said
the
servant
i
set
off
like
a
madman
when
i
reached
home
my
sister
was
playing
on
the
lawn
in
the
middle
of
the
great
silent
courtyard
as
i
dismounted
she
ran
up
to
embrace
me
and
said
with
an
air
of
importance
and
mystery
that
was
almost
joyful
the
curé
has
come
i
did
not
however
perceive
any
unusual
animation
in
the
house
nor
any
signs
of
disorder
or
alarm
i
went
rapidly
up
the
staircase
and
had
passed
through
the
boudoir
which
communicated
with
my
mother
s
room
when
the
door
opened
softly
and
my
father
appeared
i
stopped
in
front
of
him
he
was
very
pale
and
his
lips
were
trembling
maxime
he
said
without
looking
at
me
your
mother
is
asking
for
you
i
wished
to
question
him
but
he
checked
me
with
a
gesture
and
walked
hurriedly
towards
a
window
as
if
to
look
out
i
entered
my
mother
lay
in
an
one
of
her
arms
hanging
limply
over
the
side
again
i
saw
on
her
face
now
as
white
as
wax
the
exquisite
sweetness
and
delicate
grace
which
lately
had
been
driven
away
by
suffering
already
the
angel
of
eternal
rest
was
casting
the
shadow
of
his
wing
over
that
peaceful
brow
i
fell
upon
my
knees
she
her
eyes
raised
her
drooping
head
with
an
effort
and
enveloped
me
in
a
long
loving
look
then
in
a
voice
which
was
scarcely
more
than
a
broken
sigh
she
slowly
spoke
these
words
poor
child
i
am
worn
out
you
see
do
not
weep
you
have
deserted
me
a
little
lately
but
i
have
been
so
trying
we
shall
meet
again
maxime
and
we
shall
understand
one
another
my
son
i
can
t
say
any
more
remind
your
father
of
his
promise
to
me
and
you
maxime
be
strong
in
the
battle
of
life
and
forgive
the
weak
she
seemed
to
be
exhausted
and
stopped
for
a
moment
then
raising
a
finger
with
difficulty
and
looking
at
me
fixedly
she
said
your
sister
her
livid
eyelids
closed
then
suddenly
she
opened
them
and
threw
out
her
arms
with
a
rigid
and
sinister
gesture
i
uttered
a
cry
my
father
came
quickly
and
with
heartrending
sobs
pressed
the
poor
martyr
s
body
to
his
bosom
some
weeks
later
at
the
formal
request
of
my
father
who
said
that
he
was
obeying
the
last
wishes
of
her
whom
we
mourned
i
left
france
and
began
that
wandering
life
which
i
have
led
nearly
up
to
this
day
during
a
year
s
absence
my
heart
becoming
more
affectionate
as
the
selfish
frenzy
of
youth
burnt
out
urged
me
to
return
and
renew
my
life
at
its
source
between
my
mother
s
tomb
and
my
sister
s
cradle
but
my
father
had
fixed
the
duration
of
my
travels
and
he
had
not
brought
me
up
to
treat
his
wishes
lightly
he
wrote
to
me
affectionately
though
briefly
showing
no
desire
to
hasten
my
return
so
i
was
the
more
alarmed
when
i
arrived
at
marseilles
two
months
ago
and
found
several
letters
from
him
all
feverishly
begging
me
to
return
at
once
it
was
on
a
sombre
february
evening
that
i
saw
once
more
the
massive
walls
of
our
ancient
house
standing
out
against
the
light
veil
of
snow
that
lay
upon
the
country
a
sharp
north
wind
blew
in
icy
gusts
flakes
of
frozen
sleet
dropped
like
dead
leaves
from
the
trees
of
the
avenue
and
struck
the
wet
soil
with
a
faint
and
plaintive
sound
as
i
entered
the
court
a
shadow
which
i
took
to
be
my
father
s
fell
upon
a
window
of
the
large
on
the
ground
room
which
had
not
been
used
during
my
mother
s
last
days
i
hurried
on
and
my
father
seeing
me
gave
a
hoarse
cry
then
opened
his
arms
to
me
and
i
felt
his
heart
beating
wildly
against
my
own
thou
art
frozen
my
poor
child
he
said
much
against
his
habit
for
he
seldom
addressed
me
in
the
second
person
warm
thyself
warm
thyself
this
is
a
cold
room
but
i
prefer
it
now
at
least
one
can
breathe
here
are
you
well
father
pretty
well
as
you
see
leaving
me
by
the
fireplace
he
resumed
his
walk
across
the
vast
dimly
lighted
by
two
or
three
candles
i
seemed
to
have
interrupt
this
walk
of
his
this
strange
welcome
alarmed
me
i
looked
at
my
father
in
dull
surprise
have
you
seen
my
horses
he
said
suddenly
without
stopping
but
ah
yes
of
course
you
ve
only
just
come
after
a
silence
he
continued
maxime
he
said
i
have
something
to
tell
you
i
m
listening
father
he
did
not
seem
to
hear
me
but
walked
about
a
little
and
kept
on
repeating
i
have
something
to
tell
you
my
son
at
last
he
sighed
deeply
passed
his
hand
across
his
forehead
and
sitting
down
suddenly
signed
to
me
to
take
a
seat
opposite
to
him
then
as
if
he
wanted
to
speak
and
had
not
the
courage
to
do
so
his
eyes
rested
on
mine
and
i
read
in
them
an
expression
of
suffering
humility
and
supplication
that
in
a
man
so
proud
as
my
father
touched
me
deeply
whatever
the
faults
he
found
it
so
hard
to
confess
i
felt
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
that
he
was
fully
pardoned
suddenly
his
eyes
which
had
never
left
mine
were
fixed
in
an
astonished
stare
vague
and
terrible
his
hand
stiffened
on
my
arm
he
raised
himself
in
his
chair
then
drooped
and
in
an
instant
fell
heavily
on
the
floor
he
was
dead
the
heart
does
not
reason
or
calculate
that
is
its
glory
in
a
moment
i
had
divined
everything
one
minute
had
been
enough
to
show
me
all
at
once
and
without
a
word
of
a
burst
of
irresistible
light
the
fatal
truth
which
a
thousand
things
daily
repeated
under
my
eyes
had
never
made
me
suspect
ruin
was
here
in
this
house
over
my
head
yet
i
do
not
think
that
i
should
have
mourned
my
father
more
sincerely
or
more
bitterly
if
he
had
left
me
loaded
with
benefits
with
my
regret
and
my
deep
sorrow
there
was
mingled
a
pity
strangely
poignant
in
that
it
was
the
pity
of
a
son
for
his
father
that
beseeching
humbled
hopeless
look
haunted
me
bitterly
i
regretted
that
i
had
not
been
able
to
speak
a
word
of
consolation
to
that
heart
before
it
broke
wildly
i
called
to
him
who
could
no
longer
hear
me
i
forgive
you
i
forgive
you
my
god
what
moments
were
these
as
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
guess
my
mother
when
she
was
dying
had
made
my
father
promise
to
sell
the
greater
part
of
his
property
to
pay
off
the
whole
of
the
enormous
debt
he
had
incurred
by
spending
every
year
a
third
more
than
his
income
and
to
live
solely
and
strictly
on
what
he
had
left
my
father
had
tried
to
keep
to
this
engagement
he
had
sold
the
timber
and
part
of
the
estate
but
finding
himself
master
of
a
considerable
capital
he
had
applied
only
a
small
portion
of
it
to
the
discharge
of
his
debts
and
had
attempted
to
restore
our
fortunes
by
staking
the
remainder
in
the
hateful
chances
of
the
stock
exchange
he
had
thus
completed
his
ruin
i
have
not
yet
sounded
the
depths
of
the
abyss
in
which
we
are
engulfed
a
week
after
my
father
s
death
i
was
taken
seriously
ill
and
after
two
months
of
suffering
i
was
only
just
able
to
leave
my
ancient
home
on
the
day
that
a
stranger
took
possession
of
it
fortunately
an
old
friend
of
my
mother
s
who
lives
at
paris
and
who
formerly
acted
as
notary
to
our
family
has
come
to
my
help
he
has
offered
to
undertake
the
work
of
liquidation
which
to
my
inexperienced
judgment
seemed
beset
with
unconquerable
difficulties
i
left
the
whole
business
to
him
and
i
presume
that
now
his
work
is
completed
i
went
to
his
house
directly
i
arrived
yesterday
he
was
in
the
country
and
will
not
return
till
these
have
been
two
cruel
days
uncertainty
is
the
worst
of
all
evils
because
it
is
the
only
one
that
necessarily
stops
the
springs
of
action
and
checks
our
courage
i
should
have
been
very
much
surprised
if
ten
years
ago
any
one
had
told
me
that
the
old
notary
whose
formal
language
and
stiff
politeness
so
much
amused
my
father
and
me
would
one
day
be
the
oracle
from
whom
i
should
await
the
supreme
sentence
of
my
destiny
i
do
my
best
to
guard
against
excessive
hopes
i
have
calculated
approximately
that
after
paying
all
the
debts
we
should
have
a
hundred
and
twenty
to
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
left
a
fortune
of
five
millions
should
leave
so
much
salvage
at
least
i
intend
to
take
ten
thousand
francs
and
seek
my
fortune
in
the
new
states
of
america
the
rest
i
shall
resign
to
my
sister
enough
of
writing
for
recalling
such
memories
is
a
mournful
occupation
nevertheless
i
feel
that
it
has
made
me
calmer
work
is
surely
a
sacred
law
since
even
the
lightest
task
discharged
brings
a
certain
contentment
and
serenity
yet
man
does
not
love
work
he
can
not
fail
to
see
its
good
effects
he
tastes
them
every
day
and
blesses
them
and
each
day
he
comes
to
his
work
with
the
same
reluctance
i
think
that
is
a
singular
and
mysterious
contradiction
as
if
in
toil
we
felt
at
once
a
chastisement
and
the
divine
and
fatherly
hand
of
the
chastiser
when
i
woke
this
morning
a
letter
from
old
laubépin
was
brought
to
me
he
invited
me
to
dinner
and
apologized
for
taking
such
a
liberty
he
said
nothing
about
my
affairs
i
augured
unfavourably
from
this
silence
in
the
meantime
i
fetched
my
sister
from
her
convent
and
took
her
about
paris
the
child
knows
nothing
of
our
ruin
in
the
course
of
the
day
she
had
some
rather
expensive
fancies
she
provided
herself
liberally
with
gloves
pink
bonbons
for
her
friends
delicate
scents
special
soaps
and
tiny
pencils
all
very
necessary
useful
things
but
not
as
necessary
as
a
dinner
may
she
never
have
to
realize
this
at
six
o
clock
i
was
at
laubépin
s
in
the
rue
cassette
i
do
not
know
our
old
friend
s
age
but
i
found
him
looking
just
the
same
as
and
thin
with
a
little
stoop
untidy
white
hair
and
piercing
eyes
under
bushy
black
a
face
at
once
strong
and
subtle
i
recognised
the
unvarying
costume
the
black
coat
the
professional
white
cravat
the
family
diamond
in
the
short
all
the
outward
signs
of
a
serious
methodical
and
conservative
nature
the
old
gentleman
was
waiting
for
me
at
the
open
door
of
his
little
after
making
me
a
low
bow
he
took
my
hand
lightly
between
two
of
his
fingers
and
conducted
me
to
a
homely
looking
old
lady
who
was
standing
by
the
the
marquis
de
champcey
d
hauterive
said
laubépin
in
his
strong
rich
and
emphatic
voice
and
turning
quickly
to
me
added
in
a
humbler
tone
mme
laubépin
we
sat
down
an
awkward
silence
ensued
i
had
expected
an
immediate
explanation
of
my
position
seeing
that
this
was
to
be
postponed
i
assumed
at
once
that
it
was
unfavourable
an
assumption
confirmed
by
the
discreet
and
compassionate
glances
with
which
mme
laubépin
furtively
honoured
me
as
for
laubépin
he
observed
me
with
a
remarkable
attention
not
altogether
kindly
my
father
i
remember
always
maintained
that
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
and
under
his
respectful
manner
the
ceremonious
old
scrivener
had
a
little
of
democratic
and
even
jacobin
leaven
it
seemed
to
me
that
this
leaven
was
working
just
now
and
that
the
old
man
found
some
satisfaction
for
his
secret
antipathies
in
the
spectacle
of
a
gentleman
under
torture
in
spite
of
my
real
depression
i
began
to
talk
at
once
trying
to
appear
quite
unconcerned
so
laubépin
i
said
you
ve
left
the
place
des
the
dear
old
place
how
could
you
bring
yourself
to
do
it
i
would
never
have
believed
it
of
you
marquis
replied
laubépin
i
must
admit
that
it
is
an
infidelity
unbecoming
at
my
age
but
in
giving
up
the
practice
i
had
to
give
up
my
chambers
as
well
for
one
can
t
carry
off
a
notary
s
plate
as
one
can
a
but
you
still
undertake
some
business
yes
in
a
friendly
way
marquis
some
of
the
honourable
families
the
important
families
whose
confidence
i
have
had
the
good
fortune
to
secure
in
the
course
of
years
of
practice
are
still
glad
especially
in
situations
of
unusual
delicacy
to
have
the
benefit
of
my
experience
and
i
believe
i
may
say
they
rarely
regret
having
followed
my
advice
as
laubépin
finished
this
testimonial
to
his
own
merits
an
old
servant
came
in
and
announced
that
dinner
was
served
it
was
my
privilege
to
conduct
mme
laubépin
into
the
adjacent
throughout
the
meal
the
conversation
never
rose
above
the
most
ordinary
commonplaces
laubépin
continued
to
look
at
me
in
the
same
penetrating
and
ambiguous
manner
while
mme
laubépin
offered
me
each
dish
in
the
mournful
and
compassionate
tone
we
use
at
the
bedside
of
an
invalid
in
time
we
left
the
table
and
the
old
notary
took
me
into
his
study
where
coffee
was
served
immediately
he
made
me
sit
down
and
standing
before
the
fireplace
began
marquis
he
said
you
have
done
me
the
honour
of
intrusting
to
me
the
administration
of
the
estate
of
your
father
the
late
marquis
de
champcey
d
hauterive
yesterday
i
was
about
to
write
to
you
when
i
learned
of
your
arrival
in
paris
this
enables
me
to
convey
to
you
the
result
of
my
zeal
and
of
my
action
i
foresee
laubépin
that
the
result
is
not
favourable
marquis
it
is
not
favourable
and
you
will
need
all
your
courage
to
bear
it
but
it
is
my
rule
to
proceed
the
year
mlle
louise
hélène
dugald
delatouche
d
erouville
was
sought
in
marriage
by
odiot
marquis
de
champcey
d
hauterive
a
tradition
a
century
old
had
placed
the
management
of
the
dugald
delatouche
affairs
in
my
hands
and
i
was
further
permitted
a
respectful
intimacy
with
the
young
heiress
of
the
house
i
thought
it
my
duty
therefore
to
oppose
her
infatuation
by
every
argument
in
my
power
and
to
dissuade
her
from
this
deplorable
alliance
i
say
deplorable
alliance
without
reference
to
de
champcey
s
fortune
which
was
nearly
equal
to
that
of
mlle
delatouche
though
even
at
this
time
he
had
mortgaged
it
to
some
extent
i
say
so
because
i
knew
his
character
and
temperament
which
were
in
the
main
hereditary
under
the
fascinating
and
chivalrous
manner
common
to
all
of
his
race
i
saw
clearly
the
heedless
obstinacy
the
incurable
irresponsibility
the
mania
for
pleasure
and
finally
the
pitiless
selfishness
sir
i
interrupted
sharply
my
father
s
memory
is
sacred
to
me
and
so
it
must
be
to
every
one
who
speaks
of
him
in
my
presence
sir
replied
the
old
man
with
a
sudden
and
violent
emotion
i
respect
that
sentiment
hut
when
i
speak
of
your
father
i
find
it
hard
to
forget
that
he
was
the
man
who
killed
your
mother
that
heroic
child
that
saint
that
angel
i
had
risen
in
great
agitation
laubépin
who
had
taken
a
few
steps
across
the
room
seized
my
arm
forgive
me
young
man
he
said
to
me
i
loved
your
mother
and
wept
for
her
you
must
forgive
me
then
returning
to
the
he
continued
in
his
usual
solemn
tone
i
had
the
honour
and
the
pain
of
drawing
up
your
mother
s
marriage
contract
in
spite
of
my
remonstrance
the
strict
settlement
of
her
property
upon
herself
had
not
been
adopted
and
it
was
only
with
much
difficulty
that
i
got
included
in
the
deed
a
protective
clause
by
which
about
a
third
of
your
mother
s
estate
could
not
be
sold
except
with
her
consent
duly
and
legally
authenticated
a
useless
precaution
marquis
i
might
call
it
the
cruel
precaution
of
an
friendship
this
fatal
clause
brought
most
intolerable
sufferings
to
the
very
person
whose
peace
it
was
intended
to
secure
i
refer
to
the
disputes
and
quarrels
and
wrangles
the
echo
of
which
must
sometimes
have
reached
your
ears
and
in
which
bit
by
bit
your
mother
s
last
children
s
torn
from
her
spare
me
m
laubépin
i
obey
i
will
speak
only
of
the
present
directly
i
was
honoured
with
your
confidence
marquis
my
first
duty
was
to
advise
you
not
to
accept
the
encumbered
estate
unless
after
paying
all
liabilities
such
a
course
seemed
to
cast
a
slur
on
my
father
s
memory
and
i
could
not
adopt
it
laubépin
darted
one
of
his
inquisitorial
glances
at
me
and
continued
you
are
apparently
aware
that
by
not
having
availed
yourself
of
this
perfectly
legal
method
you
became
responsible
for
all
liabilities
even
if
they
exceed
the
value
of
the
estate
itself
and
that
it
is
my
painful
duty
to
tell
you
is
the
case
in
the
present
instance
you
will
see
by
these
documents
that
after
getting
exceptionally
favourable
terms
for
the
you
and
your
sister
are
still
indebted
to
your
father
s
creditors
to
the
amount
of
thousand
francs
i
was
utterly
stunned
by
this
news
which
far
exceeded
my
worst
apprehensions
for
a
minute
i
stared
at
the
clock
without
seeing
the
hour
it
marked
and
listened
dazed
to
the
monotonous
sound
of
the
pendulum
now
continued
laubépin
after
a
silence
the
moment
has
come
to
tell
you
marquis
that
your
mother
in
view
of
contingencies
which
are
unfortunately
realized
deposited
with
me
some
jewels
which
are
valued
at
about
fifty
thousand
francs
to
exempt
this
small
sum
now
your
sole
resource
from
the
claims
of
the
creditors
of
the
estate
we
can
i
believe
make
use
of
the
legal
resource
which
i
shall
have
the
honour
of
submitting
to
you
that
will
not
be
necessary
laubépin
i
am
only
too
glad
to
be
able
through
this
unexpected
means
to
pay
my
father
s
debts
in
full
and
i
beg
you
to
devote
it
to
that
purpose
laubépin
bowed
slightly
as
you
wish
marquis
he
said
but
i
must
point
out
to
you
that
when
this
deduction
has
been
made
the
joint
fortune
of
mlle
hélène
and
yourself
will
consist
of
something
like
four
or
five
thousand
livres
which
at
the
present
rate
of
interest
will
give
you
an
income
of
two
hundred
and
francs
that
being
so
may
i
venture
to
ask
in
a
confidential
friendly
and
respectful
way
whether
you
have
thought
of
any
way
of
providing
for
your
own
existence
and
for
that
of
your
ward
and
sister
and
generally
what
your
plans
are
i
tell
you
frankly
i
have
none
whatever
plans
i
may
have
had
are
quite
impossible
in
the
state
of
destitution
to
which
i
am
now
reduced
if
i
were
alone
in
the
world
i
should
enlist
but
i
have
my
sister
and
i
can
not
endure
the
thought
of
seeing
the
poor
child
subjected
to
toil
and
privations
she
is
happy
in
the
convent
and
young
enough
to
stay
there
some
years
longer
i
would
gladly
accept
any
employment
which
would
enable
me
by
the
strictest
personal
economy
to
pay
her
expenses
each
year
and
provide
for
her
dowry
in
the
future
laubépin
looked
hard
at
me
at
your
age
marquis
you
must
not
expect
he
replied
to
achieve
that
praiseworthy
object
by
entering
the
slow
ranks
of
public
officials
and
governmental
functionaries
you
require
an
appointment
which
will
assure
you
from
the
outset
a
yearly
revenue
of
five
or
six
thousand
francs
and
i
must
also
tell
you
that
this
desideratum
is
not
in
the
present
state
of
our
social
organization
to
be
obtained
by
simply
holding
out
your
hand
happily
i
am
in
a
position
to
make
some
propositions
to
you
which
are
likely
to
modify
your
present
situation
immediately
and
without
much
trouble
laubépin
fixed
his
eyes
on
me
more
penetratingly
than
ever
in
the
first
place
marquis
he
went
on
i
am
the
mouthpiece
of
a
clever
rich
and
influential
speculator
this
personage
has
originated
an
idea
for
an
important
undertaking
the
nature
of
which
will
be
explained
to
you
at
a
later
period
its
success
largely
depends
on
the
of
the
aristocracy
of
this
country
he
believes
that
an
old
and
illustrious
name
like
yours
marquis
appearing
among
the
originators
of
the
enterprise
would
have
great
weight
with
the
special
public
to
whom
the
prospectus
will
be
addressed
in
return
for
this
service
he
engages
to
hand
over
to
you
a
certain
number
of
fully
shares
which
are
now
valued
at
ten
thousand
francs
and
which
will
be
worth
two
or
three
times
that
amount
when
the
affair
is
well
launched
in
addition
that
is
enough
laubépin
such
infamies
are
unworthy
of
the
trouble
you
take
in
mentioning
them
for
a
moment
i
saw
his
eyes
flash
and
sparkle
the
stiff
folds
in
his
face
relaxed
as
he
smiled
faintly
if
you
do
not
approve
of
this
proposition
marquis
he
said
unctuously
neither
do
i
however
i
thought
it
was
my
duty
to
submit
it
for
your
consideration
here
is
another
which
perhaps
will
please
you
more
and
which
is
really
more
attractive
one
of
my
oldest
clients
is
a
worthy
merchant
who
has
lately
retired
from
business
and
now
passes
his
life
with
an
only
and
daughter
in
the
quiet
enjoyment
of
an
of
thousand
francs
a
year
two
or
three
days
ago
my
client
s
daughter
by
some
accident
heard
of
your
position
i
thought
it
to
speak
frankly
i
was
at
some
ascertain
that
the
young
lady
would
not
hesitate
for
a
moment
to
accept
the
title
of
marquise
de
champcey
her
appearance
is
agreeable
and
she
has
many
excellent
qualities
her
father
approves
i
await
only
a
word
from
you
marquis
to
tell
you
the
name
and
residence
of
this
interesting
family
laubépin
this
quite
decides
me
from
i
shall
cease
to
use
a
title
which
is
ridiculous
for
one
in
my
position
and
which
it
seems
makes
me
the
object
of
the
most
paltry
intrigues
my
family
name
is
odiot
and
henceforth
i
shall
use
no
other
and
now
though
i
recognise
gratefully
the
keen
interest
in
my
welfare
which
has
induced
you
to
be
the
channel
of
such
remarkable
propositions
i
must
beg
you
to
spare
me
any
others
of
a
like
character
in
that
case
marquis
i
have
absolutely
nothing
more
to
tell
you
said
laubépin
and
as
if
suddenly
taken
with
a
fit
of
joviality
he
rubbed
his
hands
together
with
a
noise
like
the
crackling
of
parchment
you
are
a
difficult
man
to
place
maxime
he
added
smiling
oh
very
difficult
it
is
remarkable
that
i
should
not
have
already
noticed
your
striking
likeness
to
your
mother
particularly
your
eyes
and
your
smile
but
we
must
not
digress
and
since
you
are
resolved
to
maintain
yourself
by
honest
work
may
i
ask
what
are
your
talents
and
qualifications
my
education
monsieur
was
naturally
that
of
a
man
destined
for
a
life
of
wealth
and
case
however
i
have
studied
law
and
am
nominally
a
barrister
a
barrister
the
devil
you
are
but
the
name
is
not
enough
at
the
bar
more
than
in
any
other
career
everything
depends
on
personal
effort
and
us
you
speak
well
marquis
so
badly
that
i
believe
i
am
incapable
of
putting
two
sentences
together
in
public
h
m
scarcely
what
one
could
call
a
orator
you
must
try
something
else
but
the
matter
requires
more
careful
consideration
i
see
you
are
tired
marquis
here
are
your
papers
which
you
can
examine
at
your
leisure
i
have
the
honour
to
wish
you
farewell
allow
me
to
light
you
down
a
i
to
await
your
further
instructions
before
applying
the
value
of
those
jewels
to
the
payment
of
your
creditors
oh
by
no
means
but
i
should
wish
you
rather
to
deduct
a
just
remuneration
for
your
kind
exertions
we
had
reached
the
landing
of
the
staircase
laubépin
who
stooped
a
little
as
he
walked
sharply
straightened
himself
so
far
as
your
creditors
are
concerned
he
said
you
may
count
upon
my
obedience
marquis
as
to
me
i
was
your
mother
s
friend
and
i
beg
humbly
but
earnestly
that
her
son
will
treat
me
as
a
friend
i
gave
my
hand
to
the
old
gentleman
he
shook
it
warmly
and
we
parted
back
in
the
little
room
i
now
occupy
under
the
roof
of
the
which
is
mine
no
longer
i
wished
to
convince
myself
that
the
full
knowledge
of
my
misery
had
not
depressed
me
to
a
degree
unworthy
of
a
man
so
i
have
sat
down
to
write
an
account
of
this
decisive
day
of
my
life
endeavouring
to
preserve
exactly
the
phraseology
of
the
old
notary
a
mixture
of
stiffness
and
courtesy
of
mistrust
and
kind
feeling
which
more
than
once
made
me
smile
though
my
heart
was
bleeding
i
am
face
to
face
with
poverty
not
the
haughty
hidden
and
poetic
poverty
that
among
forests
and
deserts
and
savannas
fired
my
imagination
but
actual
misery
need
dependence
humiliation
and
something
worse
poverty
of
the
rich
man
who
has
fallen
poverty
in
a
decent
coat
the
poverty
that
hides
its
ungloved
hands
from
the
former
friends
it
passes
in
the
street
come
brother
courage
courage
april
for
five
days
i
have
been
waiting
in
vain
for
news
of
laubépin
i
had
counted
considerably
on
the
interest
that
he
had
appeared
to
feel
in
me
his
experience
his
business
connections
and
the
number
of
people
he
knows
would
enable
him
to
be
of
service
to
me
i
was
ready
to
take
all
necessary
steps
under
his
direction
but
left
to
myself
i
do
not
know
which
way
to
turn
i
thought
he
was
one
of
the
men
who
promise
little
and
do
much
i
am
afraid
that
i
have
been
mistaken
this
morning
i
determined
to
go
to
his
house
on
the
pretext
of
returning
the
papers
he
had
given
me
after
verifying
their
dreary
exactitude
i
was
told
that
he
had
gone
to
enjoy
a
taste
of
country
life
at
some
château
in
the
heart
of
brittany
he
would
be
away
two
or
three
days
longer
i
was
completely
taken
aback
i
had
not
only
the
pain
of
finding
indifference
and
desertion
where
i
had
looked
for
the
readiness
of
devoted
friendship
i
had
in
addition
the
bitter
disappointment
of
returning
as
i
went
with
an
empty
purse
i
had
in
fact
intended
to
ask
laubépin
to
advance
me
some
money
from
the
three
or
four
thousand
francs
due
to
us
after
full
payment
of
our
debts
in
vain
have
i
lived
like
an
anchorite
since
came
to
paris
the
small
sum
i
had
reserved
for
my
journey
is
completely
completely
that
after
making
a
truly
pastoral
breakfast
this
molles
et
pressi
copia
was
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
a
kind
of
trickery
for
my
dinner
i
will
make
melancholy
record
of
it
here
the
less
one
has
had
for
breakfast
the
more
one
wants
for
dinner
i
had
felt
all
the
force
of
this
axiom
long
before
the
sun
had
finished
its
course
among
the
strollers
whom
the
mild
air
had
attracted
to
the
tuileries
this
afternoon
to
watch
the
first
smiles
of
spring
playing
on
the
faces
of
the
marble
fauns
the
observant
might
have
noted
a
young
man
of
irreproachable
appearance
who
seemed
to
study
the
awakening
of
nature
with
extraordinary
interest
not
satisfied
with
devouring
the
fresh
verdure
with
his
eyes
he
would
furtively
detach
the
young
appetizing
shoots
and
the
leaves
from
their
stems
and
put
them
to
his
lips
with
the
curiosity
of
a
botanist
i
convinced
myself
in
this
way
that
this
form
of
nourishment
suggested
by
accounts
of
shipwrecks
is
of
very
little
value
still
i
enriched
my
experience
with
some
interesting
discoveries
for
instance
i
know
now
that
the
foliage
of
the
chestnut
has
an
exceedingly
bitter
taste
that
the
rose
is
not
unpleasant
that
the
lime
is
oily
and
rather
agreeable
the
lilac
i
believe
unwholesome
meditating
on
these
discoveries
i
walked
towards
hélène
s
convent
i
found
the
parlour
as
crowded
as
a
hive
and
i
was
more
than
usually
bewildered
by
the
tumultuous
confidences
of
the
young
bees
hélène
arrived
her
hair
in
disorder
her
cheeks
flushed
her
eyes
red
and
sparkling
in
her
hand
she
had
a
piece
of
bread
as
long
as
her
arm
as
she
embraced
me
in
an
absent
way
i
asked
well
little
girl
what
is
the
matter
you
ve
been
crying
no
maxime
no
it
s
nothing
well
what
is
it
now
tell
me
in
a
lower
tone
she
said
oh
i
am
very
miserable
dear
maxime
really
tell
me
all
about
it
while
you
eat
your
bread
oh
i
shall
certainly
not
eat
my
bread
i
am
too
miserable
to
eat
you
know
campbell
my
dearest
friend
well
we
ve
quarrelled
completely
oh
don
t
worry
darling
you
ll
make
it
up
it
will
be
all
right
dear
oh
maxime
that
s
impossible
it
was
such
a
serious
quarrel
it
was
nothing
at
first
but
you
know
one
gets
excited
and
loses
one
s
head
listen
maxime
we
were
playing
battledore
and
lucy
made
a
mistake
about
the
score
i
was
six
hundred
and
eighty
and
she
was
only
six
hundred
and
fifteen
and
she
declared
she
was
six
hundred
and
you
must
say
that
was
a
little
too
bad
of
course
i
said
my
figure
was
right
and
she
said
hers
was
well
mademoiselle
i
said
to
her
let
us
ask
these
young
ladies
i
appeal
to
no
mademoiselle
she
replied
i
am
sure
i
am
right
and
you
don
t
play
you
mademoiselle
i
said
to
you
are
a
liar
very
well
mademoiselle
she
said
then
i
despise
you
too
much
to
answer
just
at
that
moment
sister
came
up
which
was
a
good
thing
for
i
am
sure
i
should
have
hit
her
now
you
know
what
happened
can
we
possibly
make
it
up
no
it
is
impossible
it
would
be
cowardly
but
i
can
t
tell
you
how
i
suffer
i
don
t
believe
there
s
any
one
in
the
world
so
miserable
as
i
am
yes
dear
it
s
difficult
to
imagine
anything
more
distressing
but
it
seems
to
me
that
you
partly
brought
it
on
yourself
for
it
was
you
who
used
the
most
offensive
word
tell
me
is
lucy
in
the
parlour
yes
there
she
is
in
the
corner
with
a
dignified
and
careful
movement
of
her
head
she
indicated
a
very
fair
little
girl
her
cheeks
too
were
flushed
and
her
eyes
were
red
apparently
she
was
giving
an
account
of
the
drama
which
sister
had
so
fortunately
interrupted
to
an
old
lady
who
was
listening
attentively
mlle
lucy
while
she
talked
with
an
earnestness
appropriate
to
the
subject
kept
looking
furtively
at
hélène
and
me
dear
child
i
said
to
hélène
do
you
trust
me
yes
maxime
i
trust
you
very
much
in
that
case
i
will
tell
you
what
to
do
go
very
gently
behind
mlle
lucy
s
chair
take
her
head
in
your
this
when
she
is
not
kiss
her
on
both
this
with
all
your
then
you
will
see
what
she
will
do
in
her
turn
for
a
second
or
two
hélène
seemed
to
hesitate
then
she
set
off
at
a
great
rate
fell
like
a
on
mlle
campbell
but
nevertheless
gave
her
the
sweetest
of
surprises
the
two
young
sufferers
at
last
eternally
united
mingled
their
tears
in
a
touching
group
while
the
respectable
old
campbell
blew
her
nose
with
a
noise
as
of
a
bagpipe
hélène
came
back
to
me
radiant
well
dear
i
said
i
hope
you
re
going
to
eat
your
bread
now
oh
no
i
can
t
maxime
i
am
too
much
excited
i
must
tell
a
new
pupil
came
and
gave
us
quite
a
feast
of
meringues
éclairs
and
and
i
am
not
a
bit
hungry
and
i
am
in
a
great
difficulty
about
it
because
when
we
re
not
hungry
we
have
to
put
our
bread
back
in
the
basket
and
in
my
trouble
i
forgot
and
i
shall
be
punished
but
maxime
as
we
re
crossing
the
court
when
you
go
i
shall
try
to
drop
it
down
the
cellar
without
any
one
seeing
what
little
sister
i
said
colouring
a
little
you
are
going
to
waste
that
large
piece
of
bread
it
isn
t
good
of
me
i
know
because
perhaps
there
are
poor
people
who
would
be
very
glad
of
it
aren
t
there
maxime
there
certainly
are
dear
but
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
the
poor
people
don
t
come
in
here
look
here
hélène
give
me
the
bread
and
i
ll
give
it
in
your
name
to
the
first
poor
man
i
meet
will
you
oh
yes
the
bell
rang
for
school
i
broke
the
bread
in
two
and
hid
the
pieces
shamefacedly
in
my
great
coat
pockets
dear
maxime
said
my
sister
you
ll
come
again
soon
won
t
you
then
you
ll
tell
me
whether
you
met
a
poor
man
and
gave
him
my
bread
and
whether
he
liked
it
maxime
yes
hélène
i
met
a
poor
man
and
gave
him
your
bread
which
he
seized
and
carried
off
to
his
solitary
garret
and
he
liked
it
but
this
poor
man
had
not
courage
for
he
wept
as
he
ate
the
food
that
had
come
from
your
dear
little
hands
i
will
tell
you
all
this
hélène
because
it
is
good
for
you
to
know
that
there
are
sufferings
more
serious
than
your
childish
woes
i
will
tell
you
everything
except
the
name
of
the
poor
man
april
at
nine
o
clock
this
morning
i
called
at
laubépin
s
in
the
vague
hope
that
he
might
have
returned
earlier
than
he
intended
but
he
is
not
expected
until
i
thought
at
once
of
seeing
mme
laubépin
and
explaining
the
awkward
position
i
was
placed
in
through
her
husband
s
absence
while
i
hesitated
in
a
conflict
of
shame
and
necessity
the
old
servant
alarmed
perhaps
by
my
hungry
gaze
settled
the
question
by
suddenly
shutting
the
door
i
made
up
my
mind
hereupon
to
fast
until
the
next
day
after
all
i
said
to
myself
a
day
s
abstinence
does
not
kill
one
if
this
showed
an
excessive
pride
at
all
events
i
was
the
only
one
to
suffer
and
consequently
it
concerned
no
one
but
myself
i
accordingly
made
my
way
to
the
sorbonne
where
i
attended
several
lectures
trying
to
fill
up
my
corporeal
vacuum
by
spiritual
sustenance
but
when
this
resource
came
to
an
end
i
found
it
had
been
quite
inadequate
and
i
had
an
attack
of
nervous
irritation
which
i
tried
to
calm
by
walking
it
was
a
cold
misty
day
as
i
crossed
the
pont
des
i
stopped
for
a
minute
in
spite
of
myself
leaning
on
the
parapet
i
watched
the
troubled
water
rushing
under
the
arches
i
know
not
what
unholy
thoughts
shot
through
my
worn
and
weakened
brain
i
saw
in
the
gloomiest
colours
a
future
of
ceaseless
struggle
of
dependence
and
of
humiliation
which
i
was
approaching
by
the
dark
gate
of
hunger
i
felt
a
profound
and
utter
disgust
of
life
it
seemed
impossible
to
me
under
such
conditions
at
the
same
time
a
flame
of
fierce
and
brutal
anger
leaped
up
in
me
dazed
and
reeling
i
hung
over
the
void
and
saw
all
the
river
glittering
with
sparks
of
fire
i
will
not
say
as
is
usual
god
would
not
have
it
so
i
hate
these
cant
phrases
and
i
dare
to
say
would
not
god
has
made
us
free
and
if
ever
before
i
had
doubted
it
this
supreme
soul
and
body
courage
and
cowardice
good
and
evil
held
mortal
combat
within
have
swept
my
doubts
away
forever
master
of
myself
again
those
terrible
waves
only
suggested
an
innocent
and
rather
absurd
longing
to
quench
the
thirst
that
tortured
me
i
soon
remembered
that
i
should
find
much
purer
water
in
my
room
at
home
i
went
quickly
towards
the
imagining
that
the
most
delicious
pleasures
awaited
me
there
with
pathetic
childishness
i
delighted
in
this
glorious
device
and
wondered
i
had
not
thought
of
it
sooner
on
the
boulevard
i
suddenly
came
face
to
face
with
gaston
de
vaux
whom
i
had
not
seen
for
two
years
after
a
moment
s
hesitation
he
stopped
grasped
my
hand
cordially
said
a
word
or
two
about
my
travels
and
left
me
hurriedly
but
he
turned
back
my
friend
he
said
to
me
you
must
allow
me
to
let
you
share
a
piece
of
good
luck
i
ve
just
had
i
have
put
my
hand
on
a
treasure
i
have
got
some
cigars
which
cost
me
two
francs
each
but
really
they
are
beyond
price
here
s
one
you
must
tell
me
how
you
like
it
old
man
wearily
i
mounted
the
six
flights
to
my
room
and
trembling
with
emotion
i
seized
my
friendly
and
swallowed
the
contents
in
small
mouthfuls
afterward
i
lighted
my
friend
s
cigar
and
smiled
encouragement
at
myself
in
the
glass
feeling
that
movement
and
the
distraction
of
the
streets
were
good
for
me
i
went
out
again
directly
opening
my
door
i
was
surprised
and
annoyed
to
see
the
wife
of
the
concierge
of
the
standing
in
the
narrow
corridor
my
sudden
appearance
seemed
to
disconcert
her
this
woman
had
formerly
been
in
my
mother
s
service
and
had
become
a
favourite
with
her
and
when
she
married
my
mother
had
given
her
the
profitable
post
she
still
held
for
some
days
i
had
an
idea
that
she
was
watching
me
and
now
having
nearly
caught
her
in
the
act
i
asked
her
roughly
what
she
wanted
oh
nothing
maxime
nothing
she
replied
much
confused
i
was
seeing
to
the
gas
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
and
went
away
night
was
falling
so
i
could
walk
about
in
the
more
frequented
places
without
being
fearful
of
awkward
recognitions
i
was
obliged
to
throw
away
my
made
me
feel
sick
my
promenade
lasted
two
or
three
hours
and
painful
hours
they
were
there
is
something
peculiarly
poignant
in
feeling
oneself
attacked
in
the
midst
of
the
brilliance
and
plenty
of
civilization
by
the
scourge
of
savage
it
brings
you
near
to
madness
it
s
a
tiger
springing
at
your
throat
in
the
middle
of
the
boulevards
i
made
some
original
reflections
hunger
after
all
is
not
an
empty
word
there
actually
is
a
complaint
of
that
name
and
there
are
human
beings
who
endure
nearly
every
day
what
through
a
mere
accident
i
am
suffering
for
once
in
my
life
and
how
many
have
their
misery
embittered
by
troubles
which
i
am
spared
i
know
that
the
one
being
in
the
world
whom
i
love
is
sheltered
from
such
sufferings
as
mine
but
how
many
can
not
suffer
alone
how
many
must
hear
the
cry
of
nature
repeated
on
beloved
lips
that
ask
for
food
how
many
for
whom
pale
women
and
unsmiling
children
are
waiting
in
bare
cold
rooms
poor
creatures
blessed
be
holy
charity
after
these
thoughts
i
dared
not
complain
they
gave
me
courage
to
bear
my
trial
to
the
end
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
could
have
shortened
it
there
are
two
or
three
restaurants
where
i
am
known
and
where
when
i
was
rich
i
had
often
gone
in
without
hesitation
though
i
had
forgotten
to
bring
my
purse
i
might
have
made
some
such
pretext
nor
would
it
have
been
difficult
for
me
to
borrow
a
franc
or
two
in
paris
but
i
recoiled
from
such
expedients
they
suggested
poverty
too
plainly
and
they
came
too
near
to
trickery
that
descent
is
swift
and
slippery
for
the
poor
and
i
believe
i
would
rather
lose
honesty
itself
than
the
delicacy
which
gives
distinction
to
the
commonplace
virtue
i
have
seen
too
often
with
what
facility
this
exquisite
sentiment
of
honesty
loses
its
bloom
even
in
the
finest
natures
not
merely
under
the
breath
of
misery
but
at
the
slightest
contact
with
privation
so
i
shall
keep
strict
watch
over
myself
i
shall
be
on
my
guard
henceforth
against
even
the
most
innocent
compromise
with
conscience
when
bad
times
come
do
not
accustom
your
soul
to
suppleness
it
is
only
too
prone
to
yield
fatigue
and
cold
drove
me
back
about
nine
o
clock
the
door
of
the
was
open
treading
as
lightly
as
a
ghost
i
had
reached
the
staircase
when
the
sound
of
a
lively
conversation
came
from
the
concierge
s
room
they
were
talking
about
me
for
at
this
very
moment
the
tyrant
of
the
house
pronounced
my
name
with
unmistakable
contempt
be
good
enough
mme
vauberger
said
the
concierge
not
to
trouble
me
with
your
maxime
did
i
ruin
your
maxime
then
what
are
you
talking
to
me
about
if
he
kills
himself
they
ll
bury
him
won
t
they
i
tell
you
vauberger
his
wife
answered
it
would
have
made
your
heart
bleed
to
see
him
drain
his
and
if
i
believed
you
meant
what
you
say
in
that
offhand
like
an
if
he
kills
himself
they
ll
bury
him
i
but
i
know
you
don
t
because
you
re
a
good
sort
although
you
don
t
like
being
upset
fancy
being
without
fire
or
bread
and
that
after
being
fed
on
dainties
all
your
life
and
wrapped
up
in
furs
like
a
little
pet
cat
it
s
a
shame
and
a
disgrace
a
nice
sort
of
government
yours
is
to
allow
such
things
but
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
government
said
vauberger
reasonably
enough
and
i
m
sure
you
re
wrong
it
s
not
so
bad
as
all
that
he
can
t
be
wanting
bread
it
s
impossible
all
right
vauberger
i
ve
more
to
tell
you
i
ve
followed
him
i
ve
watched
him
and
made
edouard
watch
him
too
yes
i
have
i
m
certain
he
had
no
dinner
yesterday
and
no
breakfast
and
as
i
ve
searched
his
pockets
and
all
the
drawers
and
not
found
so
much
as
a
red
cent
you
may
be
sure
he
hasn
t
had
any
dinner
for
he
s
much
too
high
and
mighty
to
go
and
beg
one
oh
is
he
so
much
the
worse
for
him
poor
people
shouldn
t
be
proud
said
the
worthy
concierge
true
to
the
sentiments
of
his
calling
i
had
had
enough
of
this
dialogue
and
put
an
end
to
it
abruptly
by
opening
the
door
and
asking
vauberger
for
a
light
i
could
not
have
astounded
him
more
if
i
had
asked
for
his
head
though
i
particularly
wished
not
to
give
way
before
these
people
i
could
not
help
stumbling
once
or
twice
as
i
went
up
the
stairs
my
head
was
swimming
usually
my
room
was
as
cold
as
ice
imagine
my
surprise
at
finding
a
bright
cheerful
fire
which
sent
a
pleasant
warmth
through
the
room
i
wasn
t
stoic
enough
to
put
it
out
and
i
blessed
the
kind
hearts
there
are
in
the
world
i
stretched
myself
out
in
an
old
of
utrecht
velvet
which
like
myself
had
been
brought
by
reverses
from
the
first
floor
to
the
garret
i
tried
to
sleep
for
half
an
hour
i
had
been
dreaming
in
a
kind
of
torpor
of
sumptuous
banquets
and
merry
junketings
when
the
noise
of
the
door
opening
made
me
jump
up
with
a
start
i
thought
i
was
dreaming
still
when
mme
vauberger
came
in
carrying
a
big
tray
with
two
or
three
savoury
dishes
steaming
on
it
before
i
could
shake
off
my
lethargy
she
had
put
the
tray
down
and
had
begun
to
lay
the
cloth
at
last
i
started
up
hastily
well
i
said
what
does
this
mean
what
are
you
doing
mme
vauberger
pretended
to
be
greatly
surprised
i
thought
you
ordered
dinner
sir
oh
no
edouard
told
me
edouard
made
a
mistake
it
s
for
one
of
the
other
tenants
you
had
better
see
but
there
s
no
other
tenant
on
this
floor
sir
i
can
t
make
out
well
it
was
not
for
me
what
does
all
this
mean
oh
you
annoy
me
take
it
away
the
poor
woman
began
to
fold
the
cloth
looking
at
me
reproachfully
like
a
favourite
dog
who
has
been
beaten
i
suppose
you
ve
had
dinner
already
sir
she
said
timidly
no
doubt
that
is
a
pity
because
this
dinner
is
quite
ready
and
now
it
will
be
wasted
and
the
boy
ll
get
a
scolding
from
his
father
if
you
hadn
t
had
your
dinner
already
sir
you
would
have
very
much
obliged
me
i
stamped
my
foot
violently
leave
the
room
i
tell
you
i
said
and
as
she
was
going
out
i
went
up
to
her
my
good
louison
i
said
i
understand
and
i
thank
you
but
i
am
not
very
well
and
i
have
no
appetite
ah
maxime
she
exclaimed
in
tears
you
don
t
know
how
you
hurt
my
feelings
well
you
can
pay
me
for
the
dinner
you
shall
if
you
like
you
can
give
me
the
money
as
soon
as
you
get
some
but
if
you
gave
me
a
hundred
thousand
francs
it
wouldn
t
make
me
so
happy
as
seeing
you
eat
my
poor
dinner
you
would
do
me
a
great
kindness
maxime
you
who
are
so
clever
you
ought
to
understand
how
i
feel
oh
i
know
you
will
m
maxime
well
my
dear
louison
what
am
i
to
do
i
can
t
give
you
a
hundred
thousand
francs
but
i
am
going
to
eat
your
dinner
all
by
myself
too
if
you
don
t
mind
certainly
sir
oh
thank
you
sir
i
thank
you
very
much
indeed
you
have
a
kind
heart
sir
and
a
good
appetite
louison
give
me
your
not
to
put
money
in
you
may
be
sure
there
louison
the
good
woman
went
out
sobbing
i
did
justice
to
louison
s
dinner
and
had
just
finished
writing
these
lines
when
a
grave
and
heavy
footstep
sounded
on
the
stairs
and
at
the
same
time
i
thought
i
heard
the
voice
of
my
humble
providence
whispering
confidences
in
hurried
nervous
tones
a
moment
or
two
later
there
was
a
knock
louison
slipped
away
in
the
darkness
and
the
solemn
outline
of
the
old
notary
appeared
in
the
doorway
laubépin
cast
a
keen
glance
at
the
tray
where
i
had
left
the
fragments
of
my
dinner
then
coming
towards
me
and
opening
his
arms
at
once
confused
and
reproachful
he
said
in
heaven
s
name
marquis
why
did
you
he
broke
off
strode
quickly
about
the
room
and
then
coming
to
a
sudden
halt
exclaimed
young
man
you
had
no
right
to
do
this
you
have
given
pain
to
a
friend
and
you
have
made
an
old
man
blush
he
was
much
moved
i
looked
at
him
a
little
moved
myself
and
not
knowing
what
to
say
when
he
suddenly
clasped
me
in
his
arms
and
murmured
in
my
ear
my
poor
child
for
a
moment
we
said
nothing
when
we
had
sat
down
laubépin
continued
maxime
he
said
are
you
in
the
same
mind
as
when
i
left
you
have
you
the
courage
to
accept
the
humblest
work
the
least
important
occupation
provided
it
is
honourable
and
that
it
gives
you
a
livelihood
and
preserves
your
sister
from
the
sufferings
and
dangers
of
poverty
most
certainly
i
am
it
s
my
duty
and
i
am
ready
to
do
it
very
well
my
friend
now
listen
to
me
i
have
just
returned
from
brittany
in
that
ancient
province
there
is
a
family
called
laroque
who
have
for
many
years
past
honoured
me
with
their
entire
confidence
this
family
is
now
represented
by
an
old
man
and
two
ladies
whom
age
or
disposition
render
incapable
of
business
the
laroques
have
a
substantial
income
derived
from
their
large
estates
in
land
which
have
latterly
been
managed
by
an
agent
whom
i
took
the
liberty
to
regard
as
a
rogue
the
day
following
our
last
interview
maxime
i
received
intelligence
of
the
death
of
this
man
i
immediately
set
out
for
the
château
laroque
and
asked
for
the
appointment
for
you
i
laid
stress
on
your
having
been
called
to
the
bar
and
dwelt
particularly
on
your
moral
qualities
respecting
your
wishes
i
did
not
allude
to
your
birth
you
are
not
and
will
not
be
known
in
that
house
under
any
name
but
that
of
maxime
odiot
a
pavilion
at
some
distance
from
the
house
will
be
allotted
to
you
and
you
will
be
able
to
have
your
meals
there
when
for
any
reason
you
do
not
care
to
join
the
family
at
table
your
salary
will
be
six
thousand
francs
a
year
how
will
that
suit
you
it
will
suit
me
perfectly
you
must
let
me
acknowledge
at
once
how
much
i
feel
the
consideration
and
delicacy
of
your
friendship
but
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
am
afraid
i
am
rather
a
strange
kind
of
business
a
novice
you
know
you
need
have
no
anxiety
on
that
score
my
friend
i
anticipated
your
scruples
and
concealed
nothing
from
the
parties
concerned
madame
i
said
to
my
excellent
friend
mme
laroque
you
require
an
agent
and
an
administrator
of
your
income
i
offer
you
one
he
is
far
from
possessing
the
talents
of
his
predecessor
he
is
by
no
means
versed
in
the
mysteries
of
leases
and
he
does
not
know
the
alphabet
of
the
affairs
you
are
so
good
as
to
intrust
to
him
he
has
had
no
experience
no
practice
and
no
opportunity
of
learning
but
he
has
something
which
his
predecessor
lacked
which
sixty
years
of
experience
had
not
given
him
and
which
he
would
not
have
acquired
in
ten
thousand
that
is
honesty
madame
i
have
seen
him
under
fire
and
i
will
answer
for
him
engage
him
he
will
be
indebted
to
you
and
so
shall
young
man
mme
laroque
laughed
very
much
at
my
way
of
recommending
people
but
in
the
end
it
turned
out
to
be
a
good
way
for
it
has
succeeded
the
worthy
old
gentleman
then
offered
to
impart
to
me
some
elementary
general
notions
on
the
kind
of
administration
i
was
about
to
undertake
and
to
these
he
added
in
connection
with
the
interests
of
the
laroque
family
the
results
of
some
inquiries
which
he
had
made
and
put
into
shape
for
me
and
when
am
i
to
go
my
dear
sir
to
say
the
truth
my
boy
he
had
entirely
dropped
the
marquis
the
sooner
the
better
for
those
good
people
could
not
make
out
a
receipt
unaided
my
excellent
friend
mme
laroque
more
especially
though
an
admirable
woman
in
many
respects
is
beyond
conception
careless
indiscreet
and
childish
in
business
matters
she
is
a
creole
ah
she
is
a
creole
i
repeated
with
some
vivacity
yes
young
man
an
old
creole
lady
laubépin
said
dryly
her
husband
was
a
breton
but
these
details
will
come
in
good
time
till
maxime
and
be
of
good
cheer
ah
i
had
forgotten
on
thursday
morning
before
my
departure
i
did
something
which
will
be
of
service
to
you
among
your
creditors
there
are
some
rogues
whose
relations
with
your
father
were
obviously
usurious
armed
with
the
thunders
of
the
law
i
reduced
their
claims
on
my
own
responsibility
and
made
them
give
me
receipts
in
full
so
now
your
capital
amounts
to
twenty
thousand
francs
add
to
this
reserve
what
you
are
able
to
save
each
year
from
your
salary
and
in
ten
years
time
we
shall
have
a
good
dowry
for
hélène
well
well
come
and
lunch
with
mâitre
laubépin
and
we
will
settle
all
the
rest
maxime
my
dear
child
god
bless
you
sir
château
de
laroque
d
arz
i
left
paris
yesterday
my
last
interview
with
laubépin
was
painful
i
feel
the
affection
of
a
son
for
the
old
man
then
i
had
to
bid
hélène
farewell
it
was
necessary
to
tell
her
something
of
the
truth
to
make
her
understand
why
i
was
compelled
to
accept
an
appointment
i
talked
vaguely
of
temporary
business
difficulties
the
poor
child
understood
i
think
more
than
i
had
said
her
large
wondering
eyes
filled
with
tears
as
she
fell
upon
my
neck
at
last
i
got
away
i
went
by
train
to
rennes
where
i
stayed
the
night
this
morning
i
took
the
diligence
which
put
me
down
four
or
five
hours
ago
at
a
little
morbilian
town
not
far
from
the
château
of
laroque
we
had
travelled
ten
leagues
or
more
from
rennes
and
still
i
had
seen
nothing
to
justify
the
reputed
picturesqueness
of
our
ancient
armorica
a
flat
green
country
without
variety
eternal
in
eternal
fields
ditches
and
wooded
slopes
shutting
off
the
view
on
both
sides
of
the
road
here
and
there
a
nook
full
of
rural
charm
and
a
few
blouses
and
glazed
hats
relieving
the
very
ordinary
scene
all
this
strongly
inclined
me
to
think
that
poetic
brittany
was
merely
a
pretentious
and
somewhat
pallid
sister
of
lower
normandy
tired
of
disillusions
and
i
had
for
more
than
an
hour
ceased
to
take
any
notice
of
the
country
i
was
dozing
heavily
when
i
felt
suddenly
that
the
lumbering
vehicle
was
lurching
forward
heavily
at
the
same
time
the
pace
of
the
horses
slackened
and
a
clanking
noise
together
with
a
peculiar
vibration
proclaimed
that
the
worst
of
drivers
had
applied
the
worst
of
brakes
to
the
worst
of
diligences
an
old
lady
clutched
my
arm
with
the
ready
sympathy
excited
by
a
sense
of
common
danger
i
put
my
head
out
of
the
window
we
were
descending
between
two
lofty
slopes
an
extremely
steep
hill
evidently
the
work
of
an
engineer
too
much
enamoured
of
the
straight
line
we
soon
reached
the
bottom
of
a
narrow
valley
of
gloomy
aspect
a
feeble
brook
flowed
silently
and
slowly
among
thick
reeds
and
over
its
crumbling
banks
hung
a
few
the
road
crossed
the
stream
by
a
bridge
of
a
single
arch
and
climbing
the
farther
hill
cut
a
white
track
across
a
wide
barren
and
naked
whose
crest
stood
out
sharply
against
the
horizon
in
front
of
us
near
the
bridge
and
close
to
the
road
was
a
ruined
hovel
its
air
of
desolation
struck
to
the
heart
a
young
robust
man
was
splitting
wood
by
the
door
his
long
fair
hair
was
fastened
at
the
back
by
a
black
ribbon
he
raised
his
head
and
i
was
surprised
at
the
strange
character
of
his
features
and
at
the
calm
gaze
of
his
blue
eyes
he
greeted
me
in
an
unknown
tongue
and
with
a
quiet
soft
and
timid
accent
a
woman
was
spinning
at
the
cottage
window
the
style
of
her
hair
and
dress
reproduced
with
theatrical
fidelity
the
images
of
those
slim
chatelaines
of
stone
we
see
on
tombs
these
people
did
not
look
like
peasants
they
had
in
the
highest
degree
that
easy
gracious
and
serious
air
we
call
distinction
and
they
had
too
the
sad
and
dreamy
expression
often
seen
among
people
whose
nationality
has
been
destroyed
i
had
got
down
to
walk
up
the
hill
the
which
was
not
separated
from
the
road
extended
all
round
me
as
far
and
farther
than
i
could
see
stunted
furze
clung
to
the
black
earth
on
every
side
here
and
there
were
ravines
clefts
deserted
quarries
and
low
rocks
but
no
trees
only
when
i
had
reached
the
high
ground
i
saw
the
distant
sombre
line
of
the
heath
broken
by
a
more
distant
strip
of
the
horizon
a
little
serrated
blue
as
the
sea
and
steeped
in
sunlight
it
seemed
to
open
in
the
midst
of
this
desolation
the
sudden
vision
of
some
radiant
fairy
region
at
last
i
saw
brittany
i
had
to
engage
a
carriage
to
take
me
the
two
leagues
that
separated
me
from
the
end
of
my
journey
during
the
drive
which
was
not
by
any
means
a
rapid
one
i
vaguely
remember
seeing
woods
glades
lakes
and
oases
of
fresh
verdure
in
the
valleys
but
as
we
approached
the
château
laroque
i
was
besieged
by
a
thousand
apprehensions
which
left
no
room
for
tourist
s
reflections
in
a
few
minutes
i
was
to
enter
a
strange
family
on
the
footing
of
a
sort
of
servant
in
disguise
and
in
a
position
which
would
barely
secure
me
the
consideration
and
respect
of
the
lackeys
themselves
this
was
something
very
new
to
me
the
moment
laubépin
proposed
this
post
of
bailiff
all
my
instincts
all
my
habits
had
risen
in
violent
protest
against
the
peculiar
character
of
dependence
attached
to
such
duties
nevertheless
i
had
thought
it
impossible
to
refuse
without
appearing
to
slight
my
old
friend
s
zealous
efforts
on
my
behalf
moreover
in
a
less
dependent
position
i
could
not
have
hoped
to
obtain
for
many
years
the
advantages
which
i
should
have
here
from
the
outset
and
which
would
enable
me
to
work
for
my
sister
s
future
without
losing
time
i
had
therefore
overcome
my
repugnance
but
it
had
been
very
strong
and
now
revived
more
strongly
than
ever
in
face
of
the
imminent
reality
i
had
need
to
study
once
more
the
articles
on
duty
and
sacrifice
in
the
moral
code
that
every
man
carries
in
his
conscience
at
the
same
time
i
told
myself
that
there
is
no
situation
however
humble
where
personal
dignity
can
not
maintain
none
in
fact
that
it
can
not
ennoble
then
i
sketched
out
a
plan
of
conduct
towards
the
laroque
family
and
promised
myself
to
show
a
conscientious
zeal
for
their
interests
and
to
themselves
a
just
deference
equally
removed
from
servility
and
from
stiffness
but
i
could
not
conceal
from
myself
that
the
last
part
of
my
task
obviously
the
most
delicate
would
be
either
greatly
simplified
or
complicated
by
the
special
characters
and
dispositions
of
the
people
with
whom
i
was
to
come
into
contact
now
laubépin
while
recognising
that
my
anxiety
on
these
personal
questions
was
quite
legitimate
had
been
stubbornly
sparing
of
information
and
details
on
the
subject
however
just
as
i
was
starting
he
had
handed
me
a
private
memorandum
counselling
me
at
the
same
time
to
throw
it
in
the
fire
as
soon
as
i
had
profited
by
its
contents
this
memorandum
i
took
from
my
portfolio
and
proceeded
to
study
its
sibylline
utterances
which
i
here
reproduce

this

was
of
some
service
to
me
relieved
from
the
dread
of
the
unknown
i
felt
that
my
apprehensions
had
partly
subsided
and
if
as
laubépin
asserted
there
were
two
fine
characters
in
the
château
laroque
it
was
a
higher
proportion
than
one
could
have
expected
to
find
among
five
inhabitants
after
a
drive
of
two
hours
the
coachman
stopped
at
a
gate
flanked
by
two
lodges
i
left
my
heavy
luggage
there
and
went
towards
the
château
carrying
a
valise
in
one
hand
while
i
used
the
other
to
cut
off
the
heads
of
the
marguerites
with
my
cane
after
walking
a
little
distance
between
rows
of
large
chestnuts
i
came
to
a
spacious
circular
garden
emerging
into
a
park
a
little
farther
on
right
and
left
i
saw
deep
vistas
opening
out
between
groves
already
verdant
water
flowing
under
trees
and
little
white
boats
laid
up
in
rustic
facing
me
was
the
château
an
imposing
building
in
the
elegant
style
of
the
early
years
of
louis
xiii
at
the
foot
of
the
double
perron
and
under
the
lofty
windows
of
the
façade
stretched
a
long
terrace
which
formed
a
kind
of
private
garden
approached
by
several
broad
low
steps
the
gay
and
sumptuous
aspect
of
this
place
caused
me
a
real
disappointment
which
was
not
lessened
when
as
i
drew
nearer
to
the
terrace
i
heard
the
noise
of
young
and
laughing
voices
rising
above
the
distant
tinkle
of
a
piano
plainly
i
had
come
to
an
abode
of
pleasure
very
different
from
the
old
and
gloomy
donjon
of
my
imaginings
however
the
time
for
reflection
had
passed
i
went
quickly
up
the
steps
and
suddenly
found
myself
in
the
midst
of
a
scene
which
in
any
other
circumstances
i
should
have
thought
extremely
pretty
on
one
of
the
lawns
of
the
half
a
dozen
young
girls
linked
in
couples
and
laughing
at
themselves
whirled
in
a
flood
of
sunshine
while
a
piano
touched
by
a
skilful
hand
sent
the
rhythms
of
a
riotous
waltz
through
an
open
window
but
i
had
scarcely
had
time
to
note
the
animated
faces
of
the
dancers
their
loosened
hair
and
large
hats
flapping
on
their
shoulders
my
sudden
appearance
had
been
received
with
a
cry
of
general
alarm
succeeded
by
profound
silence
the
dancing
ceased
and
all
the
band
awaited
the
advance
of
the
stranger
in
array
of
battle
but
the
stranger
had
come
to
a
halt
with
signs
of
evident
embarrassment
though
for
some
time
past
i
had
scarcely
troubled
my
head
about
my
social
claims
i
must
confess
that
at
this
moment
i
should
gladly
have
got
rid
of
my
but
i
had
to
make
the
best
of
the
situation
as
i
advanced
hat
in
hand
towards
the
double
staircase
leading
to
the
vestibule
of
the
château
the
piano
ceased
abruptly
a
large
newfoundland
first
presented
himself
at
the
window
putting
his
head
on
the
between
his
two
hairy
paws
immediately
after
there
appeared
a
tall
young
girl
whose
somewhat
sunburnt
face
and
serious
expression
were
framed
in
a
mass
of
black
and
lustrous
hair
her
eyes
which
i
thought
extraordinarily
large
examined
the
scene
outside
with
nonchalant
curiosity
well
what
is
the
matter
she
asked
in
a
quiet
tone
i
made
her
a
low
bow
and
once
more
cursing
the
bag
which
evidently
amused
the
young
ladies
i
crossed
the
perron
hastily
and
entered
the
house
in
the
hall
a
servant
dressed
in
black
took
my
name
a
few
minutes
later
i
was
shown
into
a
large
hung
with
yellow
silk
there
i
at
once
recognised
the
young
lady
i
had
just
seen
at
the
window
she
was
beyond
question
remarkably
beautiful
by
the
where
a
regular
furnace
was
blazing
a
lady
of
middle
age
and
of
marked
creole
type
of
feature
sat
buried
in
a
large
among
a
mass
of
pillows
and
cushions
of
all
sizes
within
her
reach
stood
an
antique
tripod
surmounted
by
a
to
which
she
frequently
held
her
pale
and
delicate
hands
near
mme
laroque
sat
a
lady
knitting
whom
i
recognised
at
once
by
her
morose
and
disagreeable
expression
as
the
second
cousin
the
widow
of
the
who
died
in
belgium
mme
laroque
looked
at
me
as
if
she
were
more
than
surprised
as
if
she
were
astounded
she
asked
my
name
again
i
beg
your
pardon
monsieur
odiot
madame
maxime
manager
the
m
laubépin
yes
madame
you
are
quite
sure
i
could
not
help
smiling
yes
madame
quite
sure
she
glanced
quickly
at
the
widow
of
the
and
then
at
the
grave
young
girl
as
if
to
say
is
it
possible
then
she
moved
slightly
among
her
cushions
and
continued
pray
sit
down
odiot
she
said
i
must
thank
you
very
much
for
placing
your
talents
at
our
service
we
need
your
help
badly
i
assure
you
can
not
be
have
the
misfortune
to
be
very
wealthy
seeing
the
second
cousin
raise
her
shoulders
at
this
mme
laroque
went
on
yes
my
dear
mme
aubry
i
do
say
so
and
i
hold
to
it
god
sent
me
riches
to
try
me
most
certainly
i
was
born
for
poverty
and
privation
for
devotion
and
sacrifice
but
i
have
always
been
crossed
for
instance
i
should
have
loved
to
have
had
an
invalid
husband
laroque
was
an
exceptionally
healthy
man
that
is
how
my
destiny
has
been
and
will
be
marred
from
beginning
to
oh
don
t
talk
like
that
said
mme
aubry
dryly
poverty
would
agree
with
person
who
can
t
deny
herself
a
single
indulgence
or
refinement
one
moment
my
dear
madame
returned
mme
laroque
i
do
not
believe
in
useless
sacrifices
if
i
subjected
myself
to
the
worst
privations
who
would
be
the
better
for
it
would
you
be
any
happier
if
i
shivered
with
cold
from
morning
till
night
by
an
expressive
gesture
mme
aubry
signified
that
she
would
not
be
any
happier
but
that
she
considered
mme
laroque
s
language
extremely
affected
and
ridiculous
after
all
continued
mme
laroque
good
fortune
or
ill
fortune
what
does
it
matter
as
i
said
odiot
we
are
very
rich
and
little
as
i
may
value
our
wealth
it
is
my
duty
to
preserve
it
for
my
daughter
though
the
poor
child
cares
no
more
for
it
than
i
do
you
marguerite
a
slight
smile
broke
the
curve
of
mlle
marguerite
s
disdainful
lips
at
this
question
and
the
low
arch
of
her
eyebrows
contracted
momentarily
then
the
grave
haughty
face
subsided
into
repose
again
odiot
resumed
mme
laroque
you
shall
be
shown
the
place
which
at
laubépin
s
explicit
request
has
been
reserved
for
you
but
before
this
i
should
like
you
to
be
introduced
to
my
who
will
be
very
much
pleased
to
see
you
my
dear
cousin
will
you
ring
odiot
i
hope
that
you
will
give
us
the
pleasure
of
your
company
at
dinner
the
present
i
was
intrusted
to
the
care
of
a
servant
who
asked
me
to
wait
in
a
room
next
to
the
one
i
had
just
left
until
he
had
ascertained
laroque
s
wishes
he
had
not
closed
the
door
of
the
so
it
was
impossible
for
me
not
to
hear
these
words
spoken
by
mme
laroque
with
the
irony
habitual
to
her
there
can
you
understand
laubépin
he
talked
of
a
man
of
a
certain
age
very
simple
very
steady
and
he
sends
me
a
gentleman
like
that
mlle
marguerite
said
something
but
so
quietly
that
i
could
not
hear
it
much
to
my
regret
i
confess
her
mother
replied
immediately
that
may
be
so
my
dear
but
it
is
none
the
less
absolutely
ridiculous
of
laubépin
do
you
expect
that
a
man
of
that
kind
will
go
running
about
ploughed
fields
in
i
will
wager
that
man
has
never
worn
he
doesn
t
know
what
they
are
well
it
may
be
a
prejudice
of
mine
dear
but
seem
to
me
essential
to
a
good
bailiff
marguerite
it
has
just
occurred
to
me
you
might
take
him
to
your
grandfather
mlle
marguerite
entered
the
room
where
i
was
almost
directly
she
seemed
vexed
to
find
me
there
pardon
me
mademoiselle
i
said
but
the
servant
asked
me
to
wait
here
will
you
be
so
good
as
to
follow
me
sir
i
followed
her
she
made
me
climb
a
staircase
cross
many
corridors
and
at
last
brought
me
to
a
kind
of
gallery
where
she
left
me
i
amused
myself
by
examining
the
pictures
they
were
for
the
most
part
very
ordinary
sea
pieces
painted
to
glorify
the
old
privateersmen
of
the
empire
there
were
several
rather
murky
in
which
it
was
very
evident
that
the
little
brig
amiable
captain
laroque
guns
gave
john
bull
a
great
deal
of
trouble
then
came
several
portraits
of
captain
laroque
which
naturally
attracted
my
particular
attention
with
certain
slight
variations
they
all
represented
a
man
of
gigantic
height
wearing
a
sort
of
republican
uniform
with
large
facings
as
luxuriant
of
locks
as
kléber
and
looking
straight
before
him
with
an
energetic
glowing
and
sombre
expression
altogether
not
exactly
a
pleasant
sort
of
man
while
i
studied
this
mighty
figure
which
perfectly
realized
the
general
idea
of
a
privateersman
and
even
of
a
pirate
mlle
marguerite
asked
me
to
come
into
the
room
i
found
myself
face
to
face
with
a
shrivelled
and
decrepit
old
man
whose
eyes
showed
scarcely
a
spark
of
life
and
who
as
he
welcomed
me
touched
with
trembling
hand
the
cap
of
black
silk
which
covered
a
skull
that
shone
like
ivory
grandfather
said
mlle
marguerite
raising
her
voice
this
is
m
odiot
the
poor
old
privateersman
raised
himself
a
little
as
he
looked
at
me
with
a
dull
and
wavering
expression
i
sat
down
at
a
sign
from
mlle
marguerite
who
repeated
odiot
the
new
bailiff
grandfather
sir
murmured
the
old
man
an
interval
of
most
painful
silence
followed
captain
laroque
his
body
bent
in
two
and
his
head
hanging
down
fixed
a
bewildered
look
on
me
at
last
having
apparently
found
a
highly
interesting
subject
of
conversation
he
said
in
a
dull
deep
voice
de
beauchêne
is
dead
i
was
not
provided
with
a
reply
to
this
unexpected
communication
i
had
not
the
slightest
idea
who
de
beauchêne
might
be
mlle
marguerite
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
tell
me
so
i
limited
the
expression
of
my
regret
at
this
unhappy
event
to
a
slight
exclamation
of
condolence
but
the
old
captain
apparently
thought
this
was
not
adequate
for
the
next
moment
he
repeated
in
the
same
mournful
voice
de
beauchêne
is
dead
this
persistence
increased
my
embarrassment
i
saw
mlle
marguerite
impatiently
tapping
her
foot
on
the
floor
despair
seized
me
and
catching
at
the
first
phrase
that
came
into
my
head
i
said
yes
and
what
did
he
die
of
i
had
scarcely
asked
the
question
when
an
angry
look
from
mlle
marguerite
told
me
that
i
was
suspected
of
irreverent
mockery
though
i
was
not
conscious
of
anything
worse
than
a
foolish
i
did
all
i
could
to
give
the
conversation
a
more
pleasant
character
i
spoke
of
the
pictures
in
the
gallery
of
the
great
emotions
they
must
recall
of
the
respectful
interest
i
felt
in
contemplating
the
hero
of
these
glorious
scenes
i
even
went
into
detail
and
instanced
with
no
certain
warmth
of
feeling
two
or
three
battles
in
which
i
thought
the
brig
aimable
had
actually
accomplished
miracles
while
i
thus
expressed
the
courteous
interest
of
good
breeding
mlle
marguerite
still
to
my
surprise
regarded
me
with
manifest
dissatisfaction
and
annoyance
her
grandfather
however
listened
attentively
and
i
saw
that
his
head
was
rising
little
by
little
a
strange
smile
lighted
up
his
haggard
face
and
swept
away
his
wrinkles
all
at
once
he
rose
and
seizing
the
arms
of
his
chair
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
height
the
glare
of
battle
flashed
from
the
hollow
sockets
of
his
eyes
and
he
shouted
in
a
sonorous
voice
that
made
me
start
helm
to
windward
hard
to
windward
larboard
fire
lay
to
lay
to
grapple
smart
now
we
have
them
fire
there
above
sweep
them
well
sweep
the
bridge
now
follow
with
the
english
down
with
the
cursed
saxon
hurrah
with
this
last
cry
which
rattled
hoarsely
in
his
throat
he
sank
exhausted
into
his
chair
in
vain
his
sought
to
aid
him
mlle
laroque
with
a
quick
imperious
gesture
urged
me
to
depart
and
i
left
the
room
immediately
i
found
my
way
as
best
i
could
through
the
labyrinth
of
corridors
and
staircases
congratulating
myself
very
much
on
the
talent
for
which
i
had
displayed
in
my
interview
with
the
old
captain
of
the
aimable
alain
the
servant
who
had
received
me
when
i
arrived
was
waiting
for
me
in
the
hall
to
tell
me
from
mme
laroque
that
i
should
not
have
time
to
go
to
my
quarters
before
dinner
and
that
it
would
not
be
necessary
for
me
to
change
my
dress
as
i
entered
the
a
company
of
about
twenty
people
were
leaving
it
in
order
of
precedence
on
their
way
to
the
this
was
the
first
time
i
had
taken
part
in
any
social
function
since
the
change
in
my
condition
accustomed
to
the
small
distinctions
which
the
etiquette
of
the
grants
to
birth
and
fortune
i
felt
keenly
the
first
symptoms
of
that
indifference
and
contempt
to
which
my
new
situation
must
necessarily
expose
me
repressing
as
well
as
i
could
this
ebullition
of
false
pride
i
gave
my
arm
to
a
young
lady
well
made
and
pretty
though
rather
small
she
had
kept
in
the
background
as
the
guests
passed
out
and
as
i
had
guessed
she
proved
to
be
the
governess
mlle
hélouin
the
place
at
table
marked
as
mine
was
next
to
hers
while
we
were
taking
our
seats
mlle
marguerite
appeared
guiding
like
antigone
the
slow
and
dragging
steps
of
her
grandfather
with
the
air
of
tranquil
majesty
peculiar
to
her
she
came
and
sat
down
on
my
right
and
the
big
newfoundland
who
seemed
to
be
the
official
guardian
of
this
princess
took
up
his
place
as
sentinel
behind
her
chair
i
thought
it
my
duty
to
express
at
once
my
regret
at
having
so
maladroitly
aroused
memories
which
seemed
to
have
such
an
unfortunate
effect
on
her
grandfather
it
is
for
me
to
apologize
she
answered
i
should
have
warned
you
never
to
speak
of
the
english
in
my
grandfather
s
presence
do
you
know
brittany
well
i
said
that
i
had
not
seen
it
till
but
that
i
was
perfectly
delighted
to
know
it
and
to
show
moreover
that
i
was
worthy
so
to
do
i
enlarged
in
lyric
style
on
the
picturesque
beauties
that
had
struck
me
during
the
journey
just
as
i
was
hoping
that
this
clever
flattery
would
secure
me
the
good
graces
of
the
young
bretonne
i
was
surprised
to
see
her
show
symptoms
of
impatience
and
boredom
decidedly
i
was
not
fortunate
with
this
young
lady
good
i
see
she
said
with
a
singular
expression
of
irony
that
you
love
all
that
is
beautiful
all
that
appeals
to
the
soul
and
the
bloom
heather
rocks
and
the
fine
arts
you
will
get
on
wonderfully
well
with
mlle
hélouin
who
adores
all
those
things
for
my
part
i
care
nothing
about
them
then
in
heaven
s
name
mademoiselle
what
are
the
things
you
love
i
asked
the
question
in
a
playful
tone
mlle
marguerite
turned
sharply
on
me
flashed
a
haughty
look
at
me
and
replied
curtly
i
love
my
dog
here
mervyn
she
thrust
her
hand
fondly
into
the
newfoundland
s
thick
coat
standing
on
his
hind
legs
he
had
already
stretched
his
huge
head
between
my
plate
and
mlle
marguerite
s
i
began
to
observe
this
young
lady
with
more
interest
and
to
search
for
the
outward
signs
of
the
unimpressionable
soul
on
which
she
appeared
to
pride
herself
i
had
at
first
supposed
that
mlle
laroque
was
very
tall
but
this
impression
was
due
to
the
noble
and
harmonious
character
of
her
beauty
she
is
really
of
medium
height
the
rounded
oval
of
her
face
and
her
haughty
and
neck
are
lightly
tinged
with
sombre
gold
her
hair
which
lies
in
strong
relief
upon
her
forehead
ripples
at
every
movement
of
her
head
with
bluish
reflections
the
fine
and
delicate
nostrils
seem
to
have
been
copied
from
the
divine
model
of
a
roman
madonna
and
cut
in
living
pearl
under
the
large
deep
and
pensive
eyes
the
golden
of
the
cheeks
deepens
into
an
aureole
of
deeper
brown
which
looks
like
the
shadow
of
the
eyelashes
or
may
be
a
circle
seared
by
the
burning
glances
of
her
eyes
it
is
hard
to
describe
the
sovereign
sweetness
of
the
smile
which
animates
this
lovely
face
at
intervals
and
tempers
the
splendour
of
the
great
eyes
of
a
surety
the
goddess
of
poetry
of
reverie
and
of
fairy
realms
might
boldly
claim
the
homage
of
mortals
under
the
form
of
this
child
who
loves
nothing
but
her
dog
in
her
rarest
creations
nature
often
reserves
her
most
cruel
deceptions
for
us
after
all
it
matters
little
to
me
i
see
plainly
that
i
am
to
play
in
the
imagination
of
mlle
marguerite
a
part
something
like
that
of
a
negro
which
as
we
know
is
not
an
object
particularly
attractive
to
creoles
for
my
part
i
flatter
myself
that
i
am
quite
as
proud
as
mlle
marguerite
the
most
impossible
kind
of
love
for
me
is
one
which
might
lay
me
open
to
the
charge
of
scheming
or
but
i
fancy
that
i
shall
not
require
much
moral
courage
to
meet
so
remote
a
danger
for
mlle
marguerite
s
beauty
is
of
the
kind
which
attracts
the
contemplation
of
the
artist
rather
than
any
warmer
and
more
human
sentiment
however
at
the
name
of
mervyn
which
mlle
marguerite
had
given
to
her
mlle
hélouin
my
neighbour
plunged
boldly
into
the
arthurian
cycle
and
was
so
good
as
to
inform
me
that
mervyn
was
the
correct
name
of
the
celebrated
enchanter
whom
the
vulgar
call
merlin
from
the
knights
of
the
round
table
she
worked
back
to
the
days
of
cæsar
and
all
the
hierarchy
of
druids
bards
and
ovates
defiled
in
tedious
procession
before
me
after
them
we
fell
as
a
matter
of
course
from
to
and
from
to
while
i
wandered
in
celtic
forests
with
mlle
hélouin
who
wanted
only
a
little
more
flesh
to
make
quite
a
respectable
druidess
the
widow
of
the
made
the
echoes
resound
with
complaints
as
ceaseless
and
monotonous
as
those
of
a
blind
beggar
they
had
forgotten
to
give
her
a
they
gave
her
cold
soup
they
gave
her
bones
without
meat
that
was
how
she
was
treated
still
she
was
used
to
it
ah
it
is
sad
to
be
poor
very
sad
she
wished
she
were
dead
yes
doctor
was
speaking
to
her
neighbour
who
listened
to
her
wailings
with
slightly
ironical
yes
doctor
i
am
not
joking
i
do
wish
i
were
dead
i
am
sure
it
would
be
a
great
relief
to
everybody
think
what
it
must
have
been
in
the
position
i
ve
been
in
to
have
eaten
off
silver
plate
with
one
s
own
coat
of
arms
and
now
to
be
reduced
to
charity
to
be
the
sport
of
servants
no
one
knows
what
i
suffer
in
this
house
no
one
ever
will
know
the
proud
suffer
without
complaining
so
i
say
nothing
doctor
but
i
think
all
the
more
of
course
dear
lady
said
the
doctor
whose
name
was
desmarets
don
t
say
any
more
take
a
good
drink
that
will
calm
you
nothing
but
death
will
calm
me
doctor
very
well
madame
i
am
ready
when
you
are
said
the
doctor
resolutely
towards
the
centre
of
the
table
the
attention
of
the
company
was
monopolized
by
the
careless
caustic
and
animated
braggadocio
of
a
de
bévallan
who
seemed
to
be
allowed
the
latitude
of
a
very
intimate
friend
he
is
a
very
tall
man
no
longer
young
of
a
type
closely
akin
to
that
of
francis
i
they
listened
to
him
as
if
he
were
an
oracle
and
mlle
laroque
herself
showed
as
much
interest
and
admiration
as
she
seemed
capable
of
feeling
for
anything
in
this
world
but
as
most
of
his
popular
witticisms
referred
to
local
anecdotes
and
parish
gossip
i
could
not
adequately
appreciate
the
merits
of
this
armorican
lion
i
had
reason
however
to
appreciate
his
courtesy
after
dinner
he
offered
me
a
cigar
and
showed
me
the
way
to
the
where
he
did
the
honours
to
three
or
four
extremely
young
men
who
evidently
thought
him
a
model
of
good
manners
and
refined
wickedness
well
bévallan
said
one
of
these
young
fellows
you
ve
not
given
up
hopes
of
the
priestess
of
the
never
replied
de
bévallan
i
would
wait
ten
years
if
i
will
marry
her
or
no
one
shall
you
re
a
lucky
chap
the
governess
will
help
you
to
be
patient
must
i
cut
out
your
tongue
or
cut
off
your
ears
young
arthur
said
de
bévallan
going
towards
him
and
indicating
my
presence
with
a
hasty
gesture
a
delightful
conversational
then
followed
which
introduced
me
to
all
the
horses
all
the
dogs
and
all
the
ladies
of
the
neighbourhood
it
would
not
be
a
bad
thing
for
ladies
if
for
once
in
their
lives
they
could
hear
the
kind
of
conversation
which
goes
on
between
men
in
the
effusive
mood
that
follows
a
copious
repast
it
would
show
them
exactly
the
delicacy
of
our
manners
and
the
amount
of
confidence
they
are
calculated
to
inspire
i
am
not
in
the
least
prudish
but
in
my
opinion
this
conversation
outran
the
limits
of
the
freest
jesting
it
touched
on
everything
gaily
outraged
everything
took
on
a
gratuitous
tone
of
universal
profanation
my
education
is
perhaps
incomplete
for
it
has
left
me
with
a
certain
reserve
of
reverence
that
i
think
should
be
maintained
even
in
the
wildest
extravagances
of
high
spirits
but
we
have
in
the
france
of
our
young
america
which
is
not
happy
unless
it
can
blaspheme
a
little
after
drinking
we
have
the
future
hopes
of
the
nation
those
amiable
little
ruffians
without
father
or
mother
without
god
or
country
who
seem
to
be
the
raw
products
of
some
heartless
and
soulless
machine
which
has
accidentally
deposited
them
on
this
planet
not
at
all
to
its
beautification
in
short
de
bévallan
who
had
appointed
himself
professor
of
cynicism
to
these
beardless
did
not
please
me
nor
do
i
think
that
i
pleased
him
i
retired
very
early
on
the
ground
of
fatigue
at
my
request
old
alain
procured
a
lantern
and
guided
me
across
the
park
to
my
future
quarters
after
a
few
minutes
walk
we
crossed
a
wooden
bridge
over
a
stream
and
found
ourselves
in
front
of
a
massive
arched
doorway
flanked
by
two
small
towers
it
was
the
entrance
to
the
ancient
château
a
ring
of
aged
oak
and
pine
shut
in
this
feudal
fragment
and
gave
it
an
air
of
profound
seclusion
it
is
in
this
ruin
that
i
am
to
live
my
apartments
run
above
the
door
from
one
of
the
towers
to
the
other
and
consist
of
three
rooms
very
neatly
hung
with
chintz
i
am
not
displeased
with
this
gloomy
abode
it
suits
my
fortunes
as
soon
as
i
had
got
rid
of
alain
i
began
to
write
the
account
of
this
eventful
day
breaking
off
occasionally
to
listen
to
the
gentle
murmur
of
the
stream
under
my
window
and
to
the
call
of
the
legendary
owl
celebrating
his
doleful
loves
in
the
neighbouring
woods
i
must
now
try
to
pick
up
the
thread
of
my
personal
and
private
life
which
for
the
past
two
months
has
been
somewhat
lost
among
the
daily
duties
of
my
post
the
day
after
my
arrival
i
stayed
at
home
for
some
hours
studying
the
ledgers
and
papers
of
my
predecessor
père
as
they
call
him
here
i
lunched
at
the
château
where
only
a
few
of
last
night
s
guests
remained
mme
laroque
had
lived
a
great
deal
in
paris
before
her
s
health
condemned
her
to
perpetual
rusticity
in
her
retirement
she
had
kept
her
taste
for
the
culture
elegance
or
frivolity
which
had
centred
in
the
rue
du
bac
when
mme
de
staël
and
her
turban
held
sway
she
had
also
visited
most
of
the
large
cities
of
europe
and
had
brought
away
from
them
an
interest
in
literature
far
exceeding
the
ordinary
parisian
curiosity
and
erudition
she
read
a
great
many
newspapers
and
reviews
and
endeavoured
to
follow
as
far
as
it
was
possible
at
such
a
distance
the
movement
of
that
refined
civilization
of
which
museums
and
new
books
are
the
more
or
less
ephemeral
fruit
and
flowers
we
were
talking
at
lunch
about
a
new
opera
and
mme
laroque
asked
de
bévallan
a
question
about
it
which
he
could
not
answer
although
he
professes
to
be
well
informed
of
all
that
takes
place
on
the
boulevard
des
italiens
mme
laroque
then
turned
to
me
with
an
air
that
showed
how
little
she
expected
her
man
of
business
to
be
acquainted
with
such
matters
but
it
happened
unfortunately
that
these
were
the
only
affairs
with
which
i
was
familiar
i
had
heard
in
italy
this
very
opera
which
had
just
been
played
in
france
for
the
first
time
the
very
reserve
of
my
answers
excited
mme
laroque
s
curiosity
she
questioned
me
closely
and
before
long
put
me
in
possession
of
all
the
enthusiasms
souvenirs
and
impressions
she
had
got
in
her
travels
soon
we
were
discussing
the
most
celebrated
theatres
and
galleries
of
the
continent
like
old
friends
and
when
we
left
the
table
our
conversation
was
so
animated
that
to
avoid
breaking
the
thread
of
it
mme
laroque
almost
unconsciously
took
my
arm
we
continued
our
exchange
of
sympathies
in
the
mme
laroque
gradually
dropping
the
kindly
patronizing
tone
which
had
rather
grated
on
me
hitherto
she
confessed
that
she
was
possessed
by
a
mania
for
the
theatre
and
that
she
thought
of
having
some
theatricals
at
the
château
she
asked
my
advice
on
the
management
of
this
amusement
and
i
gave
her
some
details
of
particular
plays
that
i
had
seen
in
paris
and
petersburg
then
as
i
had
no
intention
of
abusing
her
i
rose
quickly
saying
that
i
meant
to
inaugurate
my
work
at
once
by
examining
a
large
farm
about
two
leagues
from
the
château
this
announcement
seemed
to
fill
mme
laroque
with
consternation
she
looked
at
me
fidgeted
among
her
cushions
held
her
hands
to
the
brazier
and
at
last
said
in
a
low
voice
oh
what
does
it
matter
you
can
put
it
off
and
as
i
insisted
she
replied
with
comical
embarrassment
but
you
can
not
the
roads
are
horrible
you
must
wait
for
the
fine
weather
no
madame
i
said
smiling
i
will
not
wait
a
minute
if
i
am
to
be
your
bailiff
i
must
look
after
your
affairs
madame
said
old
alain
who
had
come
in
odiot
could
have
père
hivart
old
gig
it
is
not
on
springs
but
it
s
all
the
more
solid
for
that
mme
laroque
darted
a
withering
glance
at
the
miserable
alain
for
daring
to
suggest
père
hivart
gig
to
an
agent
who
had
been
to
the
grand
duchess
hélène
s
theatricals
wouldn
t
the
buggy
be
able
to
do
it
alain
she
asked
the
buggy
madame
oh
no
i
don
t
believe
it
could
get
into
the
lane
and
if
it
did
it
would
certainly
not
come
out
whole
i
declared
that
i
could
walk
easily
no
no
declared
mme
laroque
that
s
impossible
i
couldn
t
allow
it
let
me
see
we
have
half
a
dozen
horses
here
doing
nothing
but
perhaps
you
don
t
ride
oh
i
ride
really
need
am
going
alain
get
a
horse
saddled
for
odiot
which
do
you
suggest
marguerite
give
him
proserpine
whispered
de
bévallan
maliciously
oh
no
not
proserpine
declared
marguerite
and
why
not
proserpine
i
asked
because
she
d
throw
you
said
the
girl
frankly
oh
would
she
really
may
i
ask
mademoiselle
if
you
ride
her
yes
i
do
but
she
gives
me
some
trouble
oh
well
perhaps
she
ll
give
you
less
when
i
ve
ridden
her
once
or
twice
that
decides
me
have
proserpine
saddled
alain
mlle
marguerite
s
dark
eyebrows
contracted
as
she
sat
down
with
a
gesture
that
disclaimed
all
responsibility
for
the
catastrophe
she
foresaw
if
you
want
spurs
said
de
bévallan
who
evidently
did
not
mean
me
to
return
alive
i
have
a
pair
at
your
service
without
appearing
to
notice
mlle
marguerite
s
reproachful
look
at
the
obliging
gentleman
i
accepted
his
offer
five
minutes
later
a
frantic
scuffling
announced
the
approach
of
proserpine
who
was
brought
with
some
difficulty
to
one
of
the
flights
of
steps
under
the
private
garden
she
was
a
fine
as
black
as
jet
i
at
once
went
down
the
perron
some
kind
people
with
de
bévallan
at
their
head
followed
me
to
the
motives
of
humanity
no
at
the
same
time
the
three
windows
of
the
were
opened
for
the
use
of
the
women
and
old
men
i
would
willingly
have
dispensed
with
all
this
publicity
but
it
could
not
be
helped
and
besides
i
had
very
little
anxiety
about
the
result
of
this
adventure
i
might
be
a
very
young
land
agent
but
i
was
an
old
horseman
i
could
scarcely
walk
when
my
father
put
me
upon
a
my
mother
s
great
afterward
he
took
the
greatest
pains
to
render
me
his
equal
in
an
art
in
which
he
excelled
indeed
he
had
carried
my
training
to
the
verge
of
extravagance
sometimes
making
me
put
on
the
heavy
ancestral
armour
to
perform
my
feats
of
equitation
proserpine
allowed
me
to
disentangle
the
reins
and
even
to
touch
her
neck
without
giving
the
slightest
sign
of
irritation
but
as
soon
as
she
felt
my
foot
in
the
stirrup
she
shied
at
once
and
sent
a
volley
of
kicks
above
the
marble
vases
on
the
staircase
then
sat
comfortably
down
on
her
hindquarters
and
beat
the
air
with
her
forefeet
after
this
she
rested
quivering
all
over
a
bit
fidgety
to
mount
said
the
groom
with
a
wink
so
i
see
my
good
fellow
but
i
shall
astonish
her
see
and
at
the
same
time
i
sprang
into
the
saddle
without
touching
the
stirrup
and
got
my
seat
before
proserpine
had
quite
realized
what
had
happened
the
instant
after
we
shot
at
a
hard
gallop
into
the
chestnut
avenue
followed
by
some
clapping
of
hands
which
de
bévallan
had
the
grace
to
start
that
evening
i
could
see
from
the
way
people
treated
me
that
this
incident
trifling
as
it
was
had
raised
me
in
the
public
opinion
some
other
talents
of
the
same
sort
which
i
owed
to
my
education
helped
me
to
secure
the
only
kind
of
consideration
i
wished
which
respected
my
personal
dignity
besides
i
made
it
quite
evident
that
i
should
not
abuse
the
kindness
and
consideration
shown
me
by
usurping
a
position
incompatible
with
my
humble
duties
at
the
château
i
shut
myself
up
in
my
tower
as
much
as
i
could
without
being
boorish
in
a
word
i
kept
strictly
in
my
place
so
that
none
should
be
tempted
to
remind
me
of
it
a
few
days
after
my
arrival
during
one
of
the
large
dinners
which
at
that
season
were
of
nearly
daily
occurrence
i
heard
the
of
the
neighbouring
little
town
who
was
sitting
next
to
the
lady
of
the
house
ask
her
who
i
was
mme
laroque
who
is
rather
forgetful
did
not
remember
that
i
was
quite
close
and
i
heard
every
word
of
her
reply
please
don
t
ask
me
she
said
there
s
some
extraordinary
mystery
about
him
we
think
he
must
be
a
prince
in
disguise
there
are
so
many
who
like
to
see
the
world
in
this
fashion
this
one
has
every
conceivable
talent
he
rides
plays
the
piano
draws
and
does
each
to
perfection
between
ourselves
my
dear
i
believe
he
is
a
very
bad
steward
but
there
s
no
doubt
he
is
a
very
agreeable
man
the
also
is
a
very
agreeable
man
or
thinks
he
is
which
is
just
as
satisfactory
to
his
fine
whiskers
with
his
plump
hand
and
said
sweetly
that
there
were
enough
beautiful
eyes
in
the
château
to
explain
many
mysteries
that
he
quite
understood
the
steward
s
object
and
that
love
was
the
legitimate
father
of
folly
and
the
proper
steward
of
the
graces
then
changing
his
tone
abruptly
he
added
however
madame
if
you
have
the
slightest
anxiety
about
this
person
i
will
have
him
interrogated
by
the
head
constable
mme
laroque
protested
against
this
excess
of
gallantry
the
conversation
so
far
as
it
concerned
me
went
no
further
but
i
was
very
much
annoyed
not
with
the
who
had
greatly
amused
me
but
with
mme
laroque
who
seemed
to
have
been
more
than
just
to
my
personal
qualities
and
not
sufficiently
convinced
of
my
official
abilities
as
it
happened
i
had
to
renew
the
lease
of
one
of
the
larger
farms
on
the
day
following
the
business
had
to
be
transacted
with
a
very
astute
old
peasant
but
nevertheless
i
held
my
own
with
him
thanks
to
a
judicious
combination
of
legal
phraseology
and
diplomatic
reserve
when
we
had
agreed
on
the
details
the
farmer
quietly
placed
three
of
gold
on
my
desk
though
i
did
not
understand
this
payment
as
there
was
nothing
due
i
refrained
from
showing
any
surprise
by
some
indirect
questions
which
i
asked
as
i
unfolded
the
packets
i
ascertained
that
this
sum
was
the
of
the
bargain
or
in
other
words
a
sort
of
bonus
which
the
farmers
present
to
the
landlord
when
their
leases
are
renewed
illustration
you
do
not
ask
me
where
i
am
taking
you
she
said
see
page
i
had
not
thought
of
claiming
this
as
i
had
not
found
it
mentioned
in
the
leases
drawn
up
by
my
able
predecessor
which
had
been
my
models
for
the
moment
i
drew
no
conclusions
from
his
silence
on
this
point
but
when
i
handed
over
the
windfall
to
mme
laroque
her
surprise
astonished
me
and
what
is
this
she
said
i
explained
the
nature
of
the
payment
and
had
to
repeat
my
explanation
and
is
it
a
usual
custom
she
continued
yes
madame
whenever
a
lease
is
renewed
but
to
my
knowledge
there
have
been
ten
leases
renewed
in
the
last
thirty
years
how
is
it
we
never
heard
of
such
a
custom
i
can
not
say
madame
mme
laroque
fell
into
an
abyss
of
reflections
in
which
perhaps
she
encountered
the
venerable
shade
of
le
père
hivart
at
length
she
slightly
shrugged
her
shoulders
looked
at
me
then
at
the
gold
then
again
at
me
and
seemed
to
hesitate
at
last
leaning
back
in
her
chair
sighing
deeply
and
speaking
with
a
simplicity
which
i
greatly
appreciated
she
said
very
well
monsieur
thank
you
mme
laroque
had
the
good
taste
not
to
compliment
me
on
this
instance
of
ordinary
honesty
but
none
the
less
she
conceived
a
great
idea
of
her
steward
s
ability
and
virtues
a
few
days
later
i
had
a
proof
of
this
her
daughter
was
reading
an
account
of
a
voyage
to
the
pole
to
her
in
which
an
extraordinary
bird
is
ne
vole
which
does
not
but
the
french
verb
is
also
to
steal
hence
the
application
like
my
steward
she
said
i
sincerely
believe
that
from
this
time
my
devotion
to
the
work
i
had
undertaken
gave
me
a
claim
to
a
more
positive
commendation
soon
afterward
when
i
went
to
see
my
sister
in
paris
laubépin
thanked
me
warmly
for
having
so
creditably
redeemed
the
pledges
he
had
given
on
my
behalf
courage
maxime
he
said
we
shall
give
hélène
her
dowry
the
poor
child
will
not
have
noticed
anything
unusual
and
you
my
friend
will
have
nothing
to
regret
believe
me
you
possess
what
in
this
world
comes
nearest
to
happiness
and
i
am
sure
you
will
always
possess
it
thank
heaven
it
is
a
peaceful
conscience
and
the
manly
serenity
of
a
soul
devoted
to
duty
the
old
man
is
right
of
course
i
am
at
peace
but
i
can
not
say
that
i
am
happy
my
soul
is
not
yet
ripe
for
the
austere
delights
of
sacrifice
it
has
its
outbursts
of
youthfulness
and
of
despair
my
life
is
no
longer
my
own
it
is
devoted
and
consecrated
to
a
weaker
dearer
life
it
has
no
future
it
is
imprisoned
in
a
cloister
that
will
never
be
opened
my
heart
must
not
beat
my
brain
must
not
think
save
for
another
so
be
it
may
hélène
be
happy
years
are
stealing
upon
me
may
they
come
quickly
i
pray
that
they
will
the
coldness
that
comes
with
them
will
strengthen
my
courage
besides
i
can
not
complain
of
a
situation
which
has
in
fact
fallen
agreeably
short
of
my
worst
forebodings
and
has
even
surpassed
my
brightest
expectations
my
work
my
frequent
journeys
into
the
neighbouring
departments
and
my
love
of
solitude
often
keep
me
away
from
the
château
where
i
particularly
avoid
all
the
more
festive
gatherings
and
perhaps
it
is
because
i
go
to
them
so
seldom
that
i
am
welcomed
so
kindly
mme
laroque
in
particular
shows
a
real
affection
for
me
she
makes
me
the
confidant
of
her
curious
and
perfectly
sincere
fancies
about
poverty
sacrifice
and
poetic
abnegation
which
form
such
an
amusing
contrast
to
the
chilly
creole
s
multitudinous
contrivances
for
comfort
sometimes
she
envies
the
gipsies
carrying
their
children
on
a
wretched
cart
along
the
roads
and
cooking
their
food
under
hedges
sometimes
it
is
the
sisters
of
chanty
sometimes
the
whose
heroic
work
she
longs
to
share
and
she
never
ceases
to
lament
the
late
laroque
s
admirable
health
which
prevented
his
wife
from
showing
that
nature
had
meant
her
for
a
nevertheless
she
has
lately
had
fixed
to
her
chair
a
kind
of
niche
like
a
as
a
protection
from
draughts
the
other
morning
i
found
her
triumphantly
installed
in
this
kiosk
where
she
really
awaits
her
martyrdom
in
considerable
comfort
i
have
scarcely
less
reason
to
be
satisfied
with
the
other
inhabitants
of
the
château
mlle
marguerite
who
is
always
plunged
like
a
nubian
sphinx
in
some
mysterious
vision
nevertheless
condescends
to
treat
me
to
my
favourite
airs
with
the
utmost
she
has
a
fine
contralto
voice
which
she
uses
with
perfect
art
but
at
the
same
time
with
an
indifference
and
coldness
which
i
think
must
be
deliberate
sometimes
in
an
unguarded
moment
i
have
heard
her
tones
become
impassioned
but
almost
immediately
she
has
returned
to
an
icy
correctness
as
if
ashamed
of
the
lapse
from
her
character
or
from
her
role
a
few
games
of
piquet
with
laroque
which
i
had
the
tact
to
lose
won
me
the
favour
of
the
poor
old
man
sometimes
i
find
his
dim
and
feeble
gaze
fixed
on
me
with
strange
intentness
as
if
some
dream
of
the
past
some
fanciful
resemblance
had
half
revived
among
the
mists
of
an
exhausted
memory
in
which
the
images
of
a
century
hover
confusedly
they
actually
wanted
to
return
me
the
money
i
lost
to
him
mme
aubry
who
usually
plays
with
the
old
captain
accepts
these
restitutions
without
scruple
but
this
does
not
prevent
her
from
winning
pretty
frequently
on
which
occasions
she
has
furious
encounters
with
the
old
corsair
laubépin
was
lenient
when
he
described
this
lady
merely
as
embittered
i
have
no
liking
for
her
but
out
of
consideration
for
the
others
i
have
made
an
effort
to
gain
her
and
have
succeeded
in
doing
so
by
listening
patiently
first
to
her
lamentations
over
her
present
position
and
then
to
her
impressive
description
of
her
former
grandeur
her
silver
her
furniture
her
lace
and
her
gloves
it
must
be
confessed
that
i
have
come
to
the
right
school
to
learn
to
despise
the
advantages
i
have
lost
every
one
here
by
their
attitude
and
language
eloquently
exhorts
me
to
the
contempt
of
riches
firstly
mme
aubry
who
might
be
aptly
compared
to
those
shameless
gluttons
whose
greediness
takes
away
one
s
appetite
and
who
disgust
one
with
the
dishes
they
praise
the
old
man
perishing
as
sadly
among
his
millions
as
job
on
his
dunghill
the
good
woman
romantic
and
who
in
the
midst
of
her
inopportune
prosperity
dreams
of
the
forbidden
fruit
of
suffering
and
lastly
the
haughty
marguerite
who
wears
like
a
crown
of
thorns
the
diadem
of
beauty
and
opulence
which
heaven
has
forced
on
her
brow
a
strange
girl
nearly
every
fine
morning
i
see
her
ride
past
the
windows
of
my
belfry
she
bows
gravely
to
me
the
black
plume
of
her
felt
riding
hat
dipping
and
waving
in
the
wind
and
then
she
slowly
disappears
along
the
shaded
path
that
runs
through
the
ruins
of
the
ancient
château
sometimes
old
alain
follows
her
and
sometimes
her
only
companion
is
the
huge
and
faithful
mervyn
who
strides
at
the
side
of
his
beautiful
mistress
like
a
pensive
bear
so
attended
she
covers
all
the
country
round
on
her
errands
of
charity
she
does
not
need
a
protector
for
there
is
not
a
cottage
within
six
leagues
where
she
is
not
known
and
worshipped
as
the
goddess
of
good
works
the
poor
people
call
her
mademoiselle
as
if
they
were
speaking
of
one
of
those
daughters
of
kings
who
give
poetry
to
their
legends
and
whose
beauty
and
power
and
mystery
they
recognise
in
her
i
meanwhile
am
seeking
the
key
to
the
sombre
preoccupation
that
clouds
her
brow
the
haughty
and
defiant
severity
of
her
eyes
the
cold
bitterness
of
her
tongue
i
ask
myself
if
these
are
the
natural
traits
of
a
strange
and
complex
character
or
the
symptoms
of
some
secret
suffering
remorse
or
fear
or
love
which
preys
on
this
noble
heart
however
slightly
one
may
be
interested
in
the
question
it
is
impossible
not
to
feel
a
certain
curiosity
about
a
person
so
remarkable
last
night
while
old
alain
with
whom
i
am
a
favourite
was
serving
my
solitary
repast
i
said
well
alain
it
s
been
a
lovely
day
have
you
been
riding
yes
sir
this
morning
with
mademoiselle
oh
indeed
you
must
have
seen
us
go
by
sir
very
likely
i
sometimes
do
see
you
pass
you
look
well
on
horseback
alain
you
re
very
kind
sir
but
mademoiselle
looks
better
than
i
do
she
is
a
very
beautiful
young
lady
you
re
right
sir
and
she
s
fair
inside
as
well
as
outside
just
like
her
mother
i
ll
tell
you
something
sir
you
know
perhaps
that
this
property
belonged
to
the
last
comte
de
castennec
whom
i
had
the
honour
of
serving
when
the
laroques
bought
the
château
i
must
own
that
i
was
rather
upset
and
not
inclined
to
stay
with
the
new
people
i
had
been
brought
up
to
respect
the
nobility
and
it
went
against
my
feelings
to
live
with
people
of
no
birth
you
may
have
noticed
sir
that
i
am
glad
to
wait
upon
you
that
is
because
i
think
you
look
like
a
gentleman
are
you
quite
sure
you
don
t
belong
to
the
nobility
sir
quite
sure
my
poor
alain
well
it
s
of
no
consequence
sir
and
this
is
what
i
wanted
to
tell
you
said
alain
with
a
graceful
inclination
in
the
service
of
these
ladies
i
have
learned
that
nobility
of
the
heart
is
as
good
as
the
other
more
especially
that
of
the
comte
de
castennec
who
had
a
weakness
for
beating
his
servants
still
sir
it
s
a
great
pity
mademoiselle
can
not
marry
a
gentleman
with
a
fine
old
name
then
she
would
be
perfect
but
alain
it
seems
to
me
that
it
only
depends
on
herself
if
you
refer
to
de
bévallan
sir
it
certainly
does
for
he
asked
for
her
more
than
six
months
ago
madame
was
not
opposed
to
the
marriage
and
in
fact
after
the
laroques
de
bévallan
is
the
richest
man
hereabouts
but
mademoiselle
though
she
didn
t
positively
refuse
wanted
time
to
think
the
matter
over
but
if
she
loves
de
bévallan
and
can
marry
him
whenever
she
likes
why
is
she
always
so
sad
and
thoughtful
it
s
very
true
sir
that
mademoiselle
has
changed
a
good
deal
in
the
last
two
or
three
years
before
that
she
was
as
merry
as
a
bird
now
she
seems
to
have
something
on
her
mind
but
if
i
may
say
so
it
is
not
love
for
this
gentleman
you
don
t
seem
very
fond
of
de
bévallan
yourself
alain
but
his
family
is
excellent
that
does
not
prevent
him
from
being
a
bad
lot
sir
always
running
after
the
country
girls
and
for
no
good
either
and
if
you
used
your
eyes
sir
you
might
see
that
he
is
quite
ready
to
play
the
sultan
here
in
the
château
itself
while
he
s
waiting
for
something
better
after
a
significant
pause
alain
went
on
pity
you
haven
t
a
hundred
thousand
francs
a
year
sir
and
why
alain
because
and
alain
shook
his
head
thoughtfully
during
the
past
month
i
have
made
one
friend
and
two
enemies
the
enemies
are
mlle
marguerite
and
mlle
hélouin
the
friend
is
a
maiden
lady
of
scarcely
a
compensation
i
will
first
make
up
my
account
with
mlle
hélouin
an
ungrateful
young
lady
what
she
considers
my
offences
should
rather
have
secured
her
esteem
but
she
is
one
of
the
many
women
who
do
not
care
either
to
give
or
to
inspire
such
a
commonplace
sentiment
from
the
first
i
had
been
inclined
to
establish
friendly
relations
with
her
the
governess
and
the
steward
were
on
a
similar
footing
we
had
a
common
ground
in
our
subordinate
position
at
the
château
i
have
always
tried
to
show
to
ladies
in
her
position
the
consideration
which
seems
to
me
due
to
those
in
circumstances
so
precarious
humiliating
and
hopeless
besides
mlle
hélouin
is
pretty
intelligent
and
accomplished
though
she
rather
deducts
from
these
qualities
by
the
exaggerated
liveliness
of
manner
the
feverish
coquetry
and
the
tinge
of
pedantry
which
are
the
failings
of
her
profession
i
do
not
claim
any
credit
for
my
chivalrous
attitude
towards
her
it
seemed
to
me
a
sort
of
duty
when
as
various
hints
had
warned
me
i
became
aware
that
a
devouring
lion
in
the
semblance
of
king
francis
i
was
prowling
round
my
young
this
duplicity
which
did
credit
to
de
bévallan
s
audacity
was
carried
on
under
cover
of
a
friendly
interest
with
an
astuteness
and
confidence
well
calculated
to
deceive
the
careless
and
unsuspecting
mme
laroque
and
her
daughter
especially
are
too
little
acquainted
with
the
wickedness
of
this
world
and
too
little
in
touch
with
realities
to
have
the
slightest
suspicion
for
my
own
part
i
was
angry
with
this
insatiable
and
did
my
best
to
spoil
his
plans
more
than
once
i
secured
the
attention
he
desired
to
monopolize
and
i
tried
more
especially
to
counteract
or
diminish
the
bitter
sense
of
neglect
and
isolation
which
makes
women
in
mlle
hélouin
s
position
ready
to
accept
the
kind
of
consolation
which
was
being
offered
to
her
have
i
ever
throughout
this
contest
outstepped
the
delicate
limits
of
brotherly
protection
i
think
not
the
very
words
of
the
brief
dialogue
which
has
suddenly
altered
the
character
of
our
relations
bear
witness
to
my
discretion
one
evening
last
week
we
were
taking
the
air
on
the
terrace
during
the
day
i
had
had
occasion
to
show
some
kindly
attention
to
mlle
hélouin
and
she
now
took
my
arm
and
said
as
she
bit
at
an
with
her
small
white
teeth
maxime
you
are
very
good
to
me
her
voice
was
a
little
unsteady
i
hope
so
mademoiselle
you
are
a
true
friend
yes
indeed
but
what
kind
of
a
friend
a
true
friend
as
you
say
a
friend
me
surely
much
most
decidedly
passionately
no
at
this
word
which
i
uttered
very
clearly
and
with
a
steady
look
mlle
hélouin
flung
the
away
and
dropped
my
arm
since
this
unlucky
hour
i
have
been
treated
with
a
contempt
i
do
not
deserve
and
i
should
have
been
convinced
that
friendship
between
man
and
woman
is
a
mere
illusion
if
i
had
not
had
on
the
following
day
something
like
an
antithesis
to
this
adventure
i
had
gone
to
spend
the
evening
at
the
château
and
as
the
two
or
three
families
who
had
been
staying
there
for
the
last
fortnight
had
left
in
the
morning
i
met
only
the
curé
the
desmarets
and
general
de
and
his
wife
who
like
the
doctor
lived
at
the
neighbouring
little
town
when
i
came
in
mme
de
who
had
apparently
brought
her
husband
a
handsome
fortune
was
in
close
conversation
with
mme
aubry
as
usual
these
ladies
were
in
perfect
agreement
in
language
in
which
distinction
of
form
rivalled
elevation
of
thought
they
like
two
shepherds
in
an
eclogue
alternately
lauded
the
incomparable
charms
of
wealth
you
are
perfectly
right
madame
said
mme
aubry
there
is
only
one
thing
in
the
world
worth
having
and
that
is
money
when
i
had
money
i
utterly
despised
every
one
who
had
not
and
now
i
think
it
quite
natural
for
people
to
despise
me
and
i
don
t
complain
if
they
do
no
one
despises
you
on
that
account
madame
replied
mme
de
most
certainly
not
but
all
the
same
there
s
a
very
great
difference
between
poverty
and
riches
i
must
confess
as
the
general
knows
well
enough
why
he
had
absolutely
nothing
when
i
married
his
one
doesn
t
get
fat
on
a
sword
does
one
madame
no
no
indeed
madame
exclaimed
mme
aubry
delighted
with
this
bold
metaphor
honour
and
glory
are
all
very
well
in
novels
but
a
nice
carriage
is
much
better
in
practice
isn
t
it
madame
of
course
it
is
madame
and
that
s
just
what
i
was
saying
to
the
general
this
morning
as
we
came
here
isn
t
it
general
eh
what
growled
the
general
who
was
playing
cards
in
a
corner
with
the
old
corsair
you
hadn
t
a
penny
when
i
married
you
general
had
you
continued
mme
de
you
won
t
think
of
denying
that
i
suppose
we
ve
heard
it
often
enough
i
should
say
growled
the
general
that
doesn
t
alter
the
fact
that
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
me
general
you
d
have
had
to
travel
on
foot
and
that
wouldn
t
have
been
a
fine
thing
for
you
with
your
wounds
your
of
six
or
seven
hundred
francs
wouldn
t
have
kept
a
carriage
for
you
my
friend
i
was
saying
this
to
him
of
our
new
carriage
which
is
as
easy
as
an
of
course
i
paid
a
good
price
for
it
it
s
four
thousand
francs
out
of
my
pocket
madame
i
can
well
believe
it
madame
my
best
carriage
cost
me
fully
five
thousand
including
the
mat
which
was
worth
five
hundred
francs
alone
yes
replied
mme
de
but
i
have
had
to
be
a
little
careful
for
i
ve
just
been
getting
new
furniture
the
carpet
and
curtains
alone
cost
me
fifteen
thousand
francs
you
ll
say
it
s
too
good
for
a
country
hole
like
this
you
re
right
but
the
whole
town
is
lost
in
admiration
and
after
all
one
does
like
to
be
respected
madame
of
course
madame
replied
mme
aubry
we
like
to
be
respected
and
we
are
respected
according
to
the
money
we
have
for
my
part
i
console
myself
for
not
being
respected
now
by
remembering
that
if
i
were
as
well
off
as
i
once
was
i
should
see
all
the
people
who
despise
me
at
my
feet
again
except
me
by
god
cried
desmarets
jumping
up
you
might
have
a
hundred
millions
a
year
and
i
give
you
my
word
of
honour
you
wouldn
t
see
me
at
your
feet
and
now
i
ll
go
and
get
some
air
for
devil
take
me
if
one
can
breathe
here
so
saying
the
honest
doctor
left
the
room
and
my
heart
went
out
to
him
for
the
outburst
that
had
relieved
my
own
sense
of
disgust
and
indignation
although
desmarets
was
received
at
the
house
as
a
chrysostom
to
whom
great
license
of
speech
was
allowed
his
language
had
been
so
forcible
that
it
had
produced
a
certain
embarrassment
in
the
company
and
an
awkward
silence
ensued
mme
laroque
broke
it
adroitly
by
asking
her
daughter
whether
it
was
eight
o
clock
it
can
t
be
mother
replied
mlle
marguerite
for
mlle
de
porhoët
has
not
come
yet
the
minute
after
as
the
clock
struck
the
door
opened
and
mlle
jocelynde
de
entered
the
room
with
astronomical
punctuality
on
the
arm
of
desmarets
mlle
de
who
had
this
year
seen
her
spring
and
whose
appearance
suggested
a
tall
reed
wrapped
in
silk
is
the
last
scion
of
a
noble
race
whose
earliest
ancestors
must
be
sought
among
the
legendary
kings
of
ancient
armorica
of
this
house
however
there
is
no
authentic
record
in
history
until
the
twelfth
century
when
juthail
son
of
conan
le
tort
who
belonged
to
the
younger
branch
of
the
reigning
family
of
brittany
is
mentioned
some
drops
of
the
porhoët
blood
have
mingled
with
that
of
the
most
illustrious
veins
of
of
the
rohans
the
lusignans
the
penthièvres
and
these
had
admitted
that
it
was
not
the
least
pure
of
their
blood
i
remember
that
when
in
a
fit
of
youthful
vanity
i
studied
the
alliances
of
my
family
i
noticed
the
strange
name
of
porhoët
and
that
my
father
who
was
very
learned
in
such
matters
spoke
highly
in
its
praise
mlle
de
porhoët
who
is
now
the
sole
bearer
of
the
name
had
always
refused
to
marry
because
she
wished
to
preserve
as
long
as
possible
in
the
firmament
of
the
french
nobility
the
constellation
of
those
magic
syllables
it
happened
one
day
that
the
origin
of
the
house
of
bourbon
was
referred
to
in
her
presence
the
bourbons
said
mlle
de
porhoët
sticking
her
into
her
blond
peruke
the
bourbons
are
a
good
family
but
with
an
air
of
modesty
there
are
better
however
it
is
impossible
not
to
render
homage
to
this
august
old
lady
who
bears
with
surprising
dignity
the
heavy
and
triple
majesty
of
birth
age
and
misfortune
a
wretched
lawsuit
in
some
foreign
country
which
she
has
persisted
in
carrying
on
for
fifteen
years
has
gradually
reduced
a
fortune
which
was
but
small
to
begin
with
and
now
she
has
scarcely
a
thousand
francs
a
year
privation
has
not
broken
her
pride
or
embittered
her
temper
she
is
gay
and
courteous
she
lives
no
one
quite
knows
how
in
her
small
house
with
her
little
servant
and
contrives
even
to
find
money
for
charity
to
their
great
honour
mme
laroque
and
her
daughter
are
devoted
to
their
poor
and
noble
neighbour
at
their
house
she
is
treated
with
a
respectful
attention
which
amazes
mme
aubry
i
have
often
seen
mlle
marguerite
leave
the
gayest
dance
to
make
a
fourth
for
mlle
de
porhoët
s
rubber
for
the
world
would
come
to
an
end
if
mlle
de
porhoët
s
whist
halfpenny
points
was
omitted
for
a
single
day
i
am
one
of
the
old
lady
s
favourite
partners
and
on
this
particular
evening
soon
found
myself
with
the
curé
and
the
doctor
seated
at
the
with
the
descendant
of
conan
le
tort
i
ought
to
mention
here
that
at
the
commencement
of
the
last
century
a
of
mlle
de
porhoët
who
held
an
office
in
the
establishment
of
the
duke
d
anjou
crossed
the
pyrenees
in
the
suite
of
the
young
prince
who
became
philip
v
settled
in
spain
and
prospered
there
his
posterity
became
extinct
about
fifteen
years
ago
and
mlle
de
porhoët
who
had
never
lost
sight
of
her
spanish
relatives
at
once
declared
herself
heiress
to
their
considerable
property
her
claims
were
contested
only
too
justly
i
fear
by
one
of
the
oldest
castilian
families
allied
to
the
spanish
branch
of
the
porhoëts
hence
the
lawsuit
which
the
unfortunate
octogenarian
maintained
at
great
expense
going
from
court
to
court
with
a
persistence
akin
to
mania
which
her
friends
deplored
and
other
people
ridiculed
desmarets
despite
his
respect
for
mlle
de
porhoët
belongs
to
the
party
who
laughs
more
particularly
because
he
strongly
disapproves
of
the
use
to
which
the
poor
lady
has
prospectively
devoted
her
fictitious
heritage
she
intends
to
build
in
the
neighbouring
town
a
cathedral
in
the
richest
style
which
shall
perpetuate
the
name
of
the
foundress
and
of
a
great
departed
race
to
all
future
generations
this
begotten
of
a
dream
the
harmless
hobby
of
the
old
lady
she
has
had
the
plans
made
she
spends
her
days
and
sometimes
her
nights
brooding
on
its
splendours
altering
its
arrangements
or
adding
to
its
decoration
she
speaks
of
it
as
already
existent
i
was
in
the
nave
of
my
cathedral
i
noticed
something
very
ugly
in
the
north
aisle
of
my
cathedral
i
have
altered
the
uniform
of
the
etc
well
mademoiselle
said
the
doctor
shuffling
the
cards
have
you
been
working
at
the
cathedral
since
yesterday
yes
of
course
i
have
doctor
and
i
ve
had
a
rather
happy
idea
i
have
replaced
the
solid
wall
which
you
know
separates
the
choir
from
the
sacristy
by
a
screen
of
carved
foliage
in
imitation
of
the
clisson
chapel
in
the
church
at
josselin
it
is
much
lighter
no
doubt
but
in
the
meanwhile
what
is
the
news
from
spain
can
it
be
true
as
i
think
i
saw
in
the
des
deux
this
morning
that
the
young
duke
of
proposes
to
put
an
end
to
the
case
in
a
friendly
way
by
offering
to
marry
you
mademoiselle
de
porhoët
disdainfully
shook
the
plume
of
faded
ribbons
attached
to
her
cap
i
should
refuse
absolutely
she
said
ah
yes
you
say
so
mademoiselle
but
how
about
the
guitar
that
s
been
heard
under
your
windows
the
last
few
nights
bah
bah
and
that
spaniard
who
has
been
prowling
about
the
country
in
a
mantle
and
yellow
boots
sighing
as
if
his
heart
would
burst
you
are
a
desmarets
said
mademoiselle
de
porhoët
calmly
opening
her
still
as
you
wish
to
may
say
that
my
man
of
business
wrote
to
me
from
madrid
a
day
or
two
ago
that
with
a
little
more
patience
we
should
see
the
end
of
all
our
troubles
i
can
quite
believe
that
do
you
know
where
your
man
of
business
comes
from
madame
straight
from
gil
blas
cavern
he
ll
drain
you
of
your
last
shilling
and
then
he
ll
laugh
in
your
face
how
much
better
it
would
be
to
give
up
this
folly
for
good
and
all
and
live
at
ease
quietly
what
good
will
these
millions
do
you
aren
t
you
happy
and
respected
what
more
do
you
want
as
for
your
cathedral
i
won
t
speak
of
it
is
a
bad
joke
my
cathedral
is
not
a
bad
joke
to
any
but
bad
jokers
desmarets
besides
i
am
defending
my
rights
i
am
fighting
for
justice
the
property
belongs
to
me
i
have
heard
my
father
say
so
a
hundred
times
and
never
with
my
consent
shall
it
go
to
people
who
are
actually
as
much
strangers
to
our
family
as
yourself
my
friend
or
she
added
indicating
me
this
gentleman
i
was
childish
enough
to
resent
this
remark
and
at
once
replied
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
mademoiselle
you
are
mistaken
for
my
family
has
had
the
honour
of
being
allied
to
yours
and
at
this
startling
announcement
mlle
de
porhoët
hastily
brought
her
cards
which
she
held
spread
out
fanwise
nearer
to
her
pointed
chin
and
straightening
her
spare
figure
looked
me
in
the
face
as
if
she
doubted
my
sanity
by
a
tremendous
effort
she
recovered
her
and
said
as
she
carried
a
pinch
of
spanish
snuff
to
her
thin
nose
young
man
you
will
have
to
prove
what
you
say
to
me
ashamed
of
my
foolish
boast
and
embarrassed
by
the
attention
it
had
aroused
i
bowed
awkwardly
without
speaking
our
rubber
was
played
in
gloomy
silence
it
was
ten
o
clock
and
i
was
preparing
to
slip
off
when
mlle
de
porhoët
touched
my
arm
sir
she
said
will
you
be
so
kind
as
to
accompany
me
to
the
end
of
the
avenue
i
bowed
again
and
followed
her
into
the
park
the
little
servant
in
breton
costume
went
first
carrying
a
lantern
then
came
mlle
de
porhoët
stiff
and
silent
carefully
holding
up
her
worn
silk
frock
she
had
coldly
declined
the
offer
of
my
arm
and
i
walked
humbly
at
her
side
feeling
very
much
dissatisfied
with
myself
after
a
few
minutes
of
this
funeral
march
the
old
lady
spoke
well
sir
she
said
you
may
speak
i
am
waiting
you
have
asserted
that
your
family
is
allied
to
mine
and
as
an
alliance
of
this
kind
is
a
piece
of
history
entirely
new
to
me
i
shall
be
greatly
obliged
if
you
will
enlighten
me
on
the
subject
i
had
decided
that
i
must
at
all
costs
keep
the
secret
of
my
incognito
i
venture
to
hope
mademoiselle
that
you
won
t
take
a
mere
joke
quite
seriously
a
joke
exclaimed
mlle
de
porhoët
a
nice
subject
to
joke
upon
and
sir
what
do
you
people
of
call
the
jokes
that
can
be
boldly
addressed
to
an
old
and
defenceless
woman
but
which
you
would
not
dare
to
utter
in
the
presence
of
a
man
mademoiselle
you
leave
me
no
choice
i
must
trust
to
your
discretion
i
do
not
know
whether
the
name
of
champcey
d
hauterive
is
familiar
to
you
i
know
the
champcey
d
hauterives
perfectly
well
sir
they
are
a
good
an
excellent
dauphin
family
what
inference
am
i
to
make
from
your
question
i
am
the
present
representative
of
that
family
you
exclaimed
mlle
de
porhoët
coming
to
a
sudden
halt
you
are
a
champcey
d
hauterive
yes
the
male
representative
mademoiselle
that
alters
the
question
she
said
give
me
your
arm
cousin
and
tell
me
your
history
i
thought
that
in
the
circumstances
it
would
be
better
not
to
conceal
anything
from
her
as
i
finished
the
painful
story
of
my
family
troubles
we
found
ourselves
opposite
a
small
house
remarkably
low
and
narrow
on
one
side
stood
a
kind
of
low
with
a
pointed
roof
enter
marquis
said
the
daughter
of
the
kings
of
gaël
at
the
threshold
of
her
lowly
palace
i
beg
that
you
will
enter
the
next
moment
i
stepped
into
a
little
meanly
paved
with
brick
on
the
faded
tapestry
of
the
walls
hung
portraits
of
ancestors
gorgeous
in
ducal
ermine
over
the
sparkled
a
magnificent
clock
in
and
brass
surmounted
by
a
group
representing
the
chariot
of
the
sun
some
and
an
old
couch
completed
the
furniture
of
the
room
everything
shone
with
cleanliness
and
the
air
was
filled
with
mingled
odours
of
iris
spanish
snuff
and
aromatic
essences
pray
be
seated
said
the
old
lady
taking
her
place
on
the
couch
pray
be
seated
my
cousin
i
call
you
cousin
though
we
are
not
related
and
can
not
be
as
jeanne
de
porhoët
and
hugues
de
champcey
were
so
as
to
leave
no
issue
but
with
your
permission
i
should
like
to
treat
you
as
a
cousin
when
we
are
alone
if
only
to
make
me
forget
for
a
moment
that
i
am
alone
in
the
world
so
cousin
i
see
how
you
are
situated
the
case
is
a
hard
one
most
assuredly
but
i
will
suggest
one
or
two
reflections
which
have
solaced
me
and
which
i
think
are
likely
to
bring
consolation
to
you
in
the
first
place
my
dear
marquis
i
often
tell
myself
that
among
all
the
charlatans
and
one
now
sees
rolling
in
carriages
poverty
has
a
peculiar
perfume
of
distinction
and
good
taste
and
also
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
god
has
brought
some
of
us
down
to
a
poor
and
narrow
life
that
this
coarse
materialistic
age
may
have
before
it
the
type
of
a
merit
dignity
and
splendour
which
owes
nothing
to
money
that
money
can
not
is
not
for
sale
in
all
probability
my
cousin
such
is
the
providential
justification
of
your
situation
and
of
mine
i
conveyed
to
mlle
de
porhoët
my
satisfaction
at
having
been
chosen
with
her
to
give
the
world
the
noble
example
it
needs
so
much
and
shows
itself
so
ready
to
profit
by
for
my
own
part
she
went
on
i
am
inured
to
privation
and
i
do
not
feel
it
much
when
in
the
course
of
a
life
that
has
been
too
long
one
has
seen
a
father
and
four
brothers
worthy
of
their
father
perish
before
their
time
by
sword
or
bullet
when
one
has
lost
one
by
one
all
the
objects
of
one
s
affection
and
worship
one
must
have
a
very
paltry
soul
to
be
much
concerned
about
more
or
less
ample
meals
and
more
or
less
dainty
clothing
certainly
marquis
you
may
be
sure
that
if
my
personal
comfort
only
were
at
stake
i
should
not
trouble
about
my
spanish
millions
but
to
me
it
seems
but
right
and
proper
and
exemplary
that
a
house
like
mine
should
not
disappear
without
leaving
some
permanent
sign
some
striking
monument
of
its
grandeur
and
its
faith
and
that
is
why
cousin
i
have
in
imitation
of
some
of
my
ancestors
thought
of
the
pious
foundation
of
which
you
must
have
heard
and
which
while
i
have
life
i
shall
not
relinquish
assured
of
my
sympathy
the
noble
old
lady
seemed
to
lose
herself
in
meditation
and
as
she
looked
sadly
at
the
fading
portraits
of
her
ancestors
only
the
beat
of
the
hereditary
clock
broke
the
silence
of
midnight
in
the
dim
room
there
will
be
mlle
de
porhoët
suddenly
resumed
in
a
solemn
voice
there
will
be
a
chapter
of
regular
canons
attached
to
the
church
each
day
at
matins
a
mass
will
be
said
in
the
private
chapel
of
my
family
for
the
repose
of
my
soul
and
the
souls
of
my
ancestors
the
feet
of
the
celebrant
priest
will
tread
a
slab
of
unlettered
marble
which
will
form
the
step
of
the
altar
and
cover
my
ashes
i
bent
towards
her
with
evident
emotion
with
visible
respect
mlle
de
porhoët
took
my
hand
and
pressed
it
gently
cousin
she
said
i
am
not
mad
whatever
they
may
say
my
father
who
was
truth
itself
always
declared
that
when
the
direct
line
of
our
spanish
branch
became
exhausted
we
should
be
sole
heirs
to
the
estate
unfortunately
his
sudden
and
violent
death
prevented
him
from
giving
us
more
exact
information
but
as
i
can
not
doubt
his
word
i
do
not
doubt
my
rights
however
she
added
after
a
little
pause
and
in
accents
of
touching
sadness
if
i
am
not
mad
i
am
old
and
the
people
in
spain
know
it
for
fifteen
years
they
have
dragged
me
on
from
one
delay
to
another
they
are
waiting
for
my
death
to
finish
everything
and
they
will
not
have
to
wait
long
some
morning
very
soon
now
i
must
make
my
last
sacrifice
my
dear
only
love
which
has
taken
the
place
of
so
many
broken
or
suppressed
have
but
one
of
my
tomb
she
was
silent
her
thin
hands
wiped
away
two
tears
that
flowed
down
her
worn
face
as
striving
to
smile
she
said
forgive
me
cousin
you
have
enough
troubles
of
your
own
besides
it
is
must
go
you
will
compromise
me
before
leaving
i
again
recommended
the
greatest
discretion
in
reference
to
the
secret
i
had
intrusted
to
her
she
replied
a
little
naïvely
that
i
need
not
be
anxious
and
that
my
peace
of
mind
and
dignity
were
safe
in
her
hands
nevertheless
during
the
next
few
days
i
suspected
from
mme
laroque
s
increased
attentions
that
my
excellent
friend
had
handed
on
my
confidence
indeed
mlle
de
porhoët
admitted
the
fact
declaring
that
the
honour
of
her
family
demanded
this
and
assured
me
that
mme
laroque
was
incapable
of
betraying
a
secret
intrusted
to
her
even
to
her
own
daughter
our
interview
had
filled
me
with
sympathetic
respect
for
the
old
lady
which
i
tried
to
express
by
my
actions
the
evening
of
the
next
day
i
taxed
all
the
resources
of
my
pencil
in
the
invention
of
decorations
internal
and
external
for
her
beloved
cathedral
the
attention
seemed
to
please
her
very
much
and
i
soon
got
into
the
habit
of
working
on
the
cathedral
every
evening
after
our
whist
enriching
the
ideal
edifice
with
a
statue
a
pulpit
and
a
mlle
marguerite
who
seems
to
feel
a
kind
of
adoration
for
her
old
neighbour
associated
herself
with
my
work
of
charity
by
devoting
a
special
album
to
the
basilica
porhoët
which
it
is
my
duty
to
fill
with
designs
and
drawings
and
in
addition
i
offered
my
old
confidant
to
take
my
share
in
the
inquiries
and
other
matters
of
business
connected
with
her
lawsuit
the
poor
lady
confessed
that
i
should
do
her
a
service
that
though
she
could
still
keep
up
her
ordinary
correspondence
her
sight
was
too
weak
to
decipher
the
manuscripts
of
her
archives
hitherto
she
had
not
associated
any
one
with
her
in
this
important
work
for
fear
of
giving
more
occasion
to
the
rustic
humourists
in
short
she
accepted
me
as
counsellor
and
collaborator
since
this
i
have
conscientiously
studied
the
voluminous
documents
of
her
lawsuit
and
i
have
been
convinced
that
the
case
which
must
be
sooner
or
later
definitively
settled
is
absolutely
hopeless
from
the
beginning
laubépin
agrees
with
me
in
this
opinion
which
as
far
as
possible
i
have
concealed
from
the
old
lady
meanwhile
i
have
pleased
her
by
going
through
her
family
archives
piece
by
piece
she
still
hopes
to
find
among
them
some
incontestable
proof
in
favour
of
her
claim
unfortunately
the
records
are
very
copious
and
fill
the
from
floor
to
roof
yesterday
i
went
early
to
mlle
de
porhoët
s
to
finish
before
lunch
the
examination
of
packet
no
which
i
had
begun
overnight
the
lady
of
the
house
had
not
risen
yet
so
with
the
help
of
the
little
servant
i
quietly
installed
myself
in
the
and
settled
down
to
my
dusty
work
about
an
hour
later
as
i
was
going
joyfully
through
the
last
sheet
of
packet
no
mlle
de
porhoët
came
in
dragging
a
huge
bundle
neatly
wrapped
up
in
a
white
linen
cover
my
dear
cousin
she
said
i
ve
heard
how
you
have
been
working
for
me
this
morning
so
i
determined
to
work
for
you
here
is
packet
no
i
must
confess
that
at
this
moment
mlle
de
porhoët
reminded
me
of
the
cruel
fairy
of
folklore
who
shuts
the
princess
up
in
a
lonely
tower
and
imposes
a
succession
of
extraordinary
and
impossible
tasks
on
her
last
night
she
continued
i
dreamed
that
the
key
of
my
spanish
treasure
lay
in
this
packet
so
you
will
very
much
oblige
me
by
examining
it
at
once
afterward
i
hope
you
will
do
me
the
honour
to
share
a
frugal
repast
in
the
shade
of
my
arbour
there
was
no
help
for
it
i
obeyed
and
i
need
not
say
that
the
wonderful
packet
no
contained
like
its
predecessors
nothing
more
valuable
than
the
dust
of
centuries
precisely
at
noon
the
old
lady
came
to
offer
me
her
arm
and
conduct
me
formally
to
a
little
garden
which
with
a
bit
of
adjoining
meadow
now
constitutes
the
sole
domain
of
the
porhoëts
the
table
was
set
out
under
an
arched
bower
of
foliage
and
through
the
leaves
the
sunshine
of
a
fine
summer
s
day
dappled
the
spotless
i
had
done
justice
to
the
chicken
the
fresh
salad
and
the
bottle
of
old
bordeaux
which
made
up
the
of
the
banquet
when
mlle
de
porhoët
who
seemed
charmed
with
my
appetite
turned
the
conversation
on
to
the
laroque
family
i
will
own
she
said
to
me
that
i
do
not
care
for
the
old
buccaneer
when
he
first
came
here
he
had
a
large
and
favourite
ape
which
he
dressed
up
like
a
servant
and
which
he
seemed
to
be
able
to
communicate
with
perfectly
the
animal
was
a
nuisance
to
the
whole
country
and
only
a
man
without
education
or
decency
could
have
kept
it
i
agreed
when
they
told
me
that
it
was
an
ape
but
as
a
fact
i
have
always
believed
that
it
was
a
negro
more
especially
as
i
had
always
suspected
its
master
of
having
trafficked
in
that
commodity
in
africa
but
laroque
the
son
was
a
good
sort
of
man
and
quite
a
gentleman
as
to
the
refer
of
course
to
mme
laroque
and
her
daughter
and
in
no
way
to
the
widow
aubry
an
extremely
common
to
the
ladies
i
say
they
deserve
every
good
thing
one
can
say
of
them
just
then
we
heard
the
hoofs
of
a
horse
on
the
path
that
runs
outside
the
garden
wall
and
the
next
moment
some
one
was
knocking
sharply
at
a
small
door
near
the
arbour
yes
said
mlle
de
porhoët
who
goes
there
i
looked
up
and
saw
a
black
plume
above
the
top
of
the
wall
open
said
a
gay
voice
outside
full
of
musical
intonations
open
tis
the
fortune
of
france
what
is
it
you
my
darling
said
the
old
lady
quick
cousin
run
as
i
opened
the
door
mervyn
rushed
between
my
legs
nearly
throwing
me
down
mlle
marguerite
was
tying
up
her
horse
to
the
fence
by
his
reins
odiot
she
said
without
showing
any
surprise
at
finding
me
there
throwing
the
long
folds
of
her
habit
over
her
arm
she
entered
the
garden
welcome
this
lovely
day
my
lovely
girl
said
mlle
de
porhoët
kiss
me
dear
you
ve
been
riding
too
fast
you
foolish
child
i
can
tell
by
your
colour
and
the
fire
that
literally
seems
to
flash
from
your
eyes
what
can
i
offer
you
my
beauty
let
me
see
said
mlle
marguerite
glancing
at
the
table
what
have
you
got
has
odiot
eaten
up
everything
not
that
it
matters
i
am
thirsty
not
hungry
i
utterly
forbid
you
to
drink
while
you
re
so
hot
but
wait
a
moment
there
are
some
strawberries
left
in
that
bed
strawberries
sang
the
girl
take
one
of
those
odiot
and
come
with
me
quick
while
i
chose
the
largest
of
the
mlle
de
porhoët
one
eye
and
followed
her
favourite
with
the
other
as
she
walked
proudly
along
the
sunlit
alley
look
at
her
cousin
she
whispered
with
an
approving
smile
isn
t
she
worthy
to
be
one
of
us
meanwhile
mlle
marguerite
bending
over
the
bed
and
catching
her
foot
in
her
train
at
every
step
greeted
each
strawberry
she
found
with
a
little
cry
of
delight
i
kept
near
to
her
holding
out
the
in
which
she
put
one
strawberry
for
every
two
she
ate
to
help
her
to
be
patient
when
she
was
satisfied
with
the
harvest
we
returned
in
triumph
to
the
arbour
the
rest
of
the
strawberries
were
sprinkled
with
sugar
and
crushed
by
the
prettiest
teeth
in
brittany
with
great
relish
oh
that
s
done
me
good
exclaimed
mlle
marguerite
throwing
her
hat
on
the
seat
and
leaning
back
against
the
side
of
the
bower
and
now
dearest
lady
to
complete
my
happiness
you
re
going
to
tell
me
stories
of
the
old
days
when
you
were
a
fair
warrior
mlle
de
porhoët
smiling
and
charmed
needed
no
pressing
and
began
to
tell
us
some
of
the
most
striking
events
of
her
famous
expeditions
with
lescure
and
la
rochefoucauld
and
on
this
occasion
my
old
friend
gave
me
another
proof
of
her
nobility
of
nature
for
she
paid
her
tribute
to
the
heroes
of
those
troublous
wars
without
distinction
of
party
she
spoke
of
general
hoche
whose
prisoner
she
had
been
with
almost
tender
admiration
mlle
marguerite
listened
with
an
impassioned
attention
which
surprised
me
at
one
moment
in
her
leafy
niche
her
long
eyelashes
a
little
lowered
she
sat
as
motionless
as
a
statue
at
another
when
the
story
became
more
exciting
she
put
her
elbows
on
the
table
plunged
a
beautiful
hand
into
the
masses
of
her
loosened
hair
and
fixed
the
lightning
of
her
brilliant
eyes
eagerly
on
the
old
among
the
sweetest
hours
of
my
dull
life
i
shall
always
count
those
i
spent
watching
that
noble
face
irradiated
by
the
reflections
of
the
glowing
sky
and
the
impressions
of
a
valiant
heart
when
the
was
over
mlle
marguerite
embraced
her
old
friend
and
waking
up
mervyn
who
was
asleep
at
her
feet
declared
that
she
must
return
to
the
château
as
i
was
sure
it
would
cause
her
no
embarrassment
i
had
no
hesitation
in
leaving
at
the
same
time
apart
from
my
personal
insignificance
in
the
sight
of
the
rich
heiress
mlle
laroque
was
quite
at
her
ease
without
a
chaperon
her
mother
had
given
her
the
same
kind
of
liberal
education
she
had
herself
received
in
one
of
the
british
colonies
and
we
know
that
the
english
method
accords
to
women
before
marriage
all
that
independence
which
we
so
wisely
give
them
only
when
the
abuse
of
it
becomes
irreparable
so
we
went
out
of
the
garden
together
i
held
her
stirrup
while
she
mounted
and
we
set
off
towards
the
château
really
odiot
she
said
after
a
few
steps
i
am
afraid
i
spoiled
your
in
the
garden
you
seemed
to
be
very
happy
certainly
mademoiselle
but
as
i
had
already
been
there
a
long
time
i
forgive
you
nay
more
i
thank
you
you
are
very
good
to
our
poor
friend
my
mother
is
very
grateful
to
you
and
your
mother
s
daughter
i
said
laughing
oh
i
m
not
so
easily
impressed
i
am
afraid
you
will
have
to
wait
a
little
before
you
get
any
praises
from
me
i
don
t
judge
people
s
actions
leniently
there
is
generally
more
than
one
explanation
of
them
i
grant
that
your
behaviour
towards
mlle
de
porhoët
looks
very
well
she
paused
shook
her
head
and
went
on
in
a
serious
bitter
and
frankly
insulting
tone
but
i
am
not
at
all
certain
that
you
are
not
paying
court
to
her
in
the
hope
that
she
may
make
you
her
heir
i
felt
myself
grow
pale
but
seeing
how
absurd
it
would
be
to
answer
this
young
girl
angrily
i
controlled
myself
and
replied
grandly
allow
me
mademoiselle
to
express
my
sincere
pity
for
you
she
appeared
very
much
surprised
your
sincere
pity
yes
mademoiselle
the
respectful
pity
to
which
i
think
you
have
a
right
pity
she
said
stopping
her
horse
and
slowly
turning
her
disdainful
eyes
towards
me
i
am
not
so
fortunate
as
to
understand
you
it
is
really
quite
simple
mademoiselle
if
disillusion
doubt
and
callousness
are
the
bitterest
fruits
of
long
experience
nothing
in
the
world
deserves
pity
so
much
as
a
heart
withered
by
mistrust
before
it
has
even
seen
life
sir
said
mlle
laroque
with
a
strange
vehemence
you
do
not
know
what
you
are
talking
about
and
she
added
more
harshly
you
forget
to
whom
you
are
speaking
that
is
true
mademoiselle
i
answered
gently
bowing
i
may
have
spoken
without
much
knowledge
and
perhaps
i
forgot
to
some
extent
to
whom
i
was
speaking
but
you
set
me
the
example
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
top
of
the
trees
that
bordered
the
road
mlle
marguerite
asked
with
haughty
irony
must
i
beg
your
pardon
most
certainly
mademoiselle
i
replied
firmly
if
either
of
us
should
ask
pardon
it
is
you
you
are
rich
i
am
poor
you
can
humble
yourself
i
can
not
there
was
silence
her
tightened
lips
her
quivering
nostrils
and
the
sudden
whiteness
of
her
forehead
showed
what
a
struggle
was
going
on
within
her
suddenly
lowering
her
whip
as
if
to
salute
she
said
very
well
i
beg
your
pardon
at
the
same
moment
she
gave
her
horse
a
sharp
cut
and
set
off
at
a
gallop
leaving
me
in
the
middle
of
the
road
i
have
not
seen
her
since
the
calculation
of
probabilities
is
never
more
misleading
than
when
it
has
to
do
with
the
thoughts
and
feelings
of
a
woman
after
the
painful
scene
between
mlle
marguerite
and
myself
i
had
not
been
very
anxious
to
encounter
her
for
two
days
i
had
not
been
to
the
château
and
i
scarcely
expected
that
the
resentment
i
had
aroused
in
this
proud
nature
would
have
subsided
in
this
short
interval
however
about
seven
o
clock
on
the
morning
of
the
day
before
yesterday
when
i
was
working
at
the
open
window
of
my
tower
i
heard
my
name
called
out
in
a
most
friendly
way
by
the
very
person
of
whom
i
thought
i
had
made
an
enemy
odiot
are
you
there
i
went
to
the
window
and
saw
mlle
marguerite
standing
in
the
boat
that
was
kept
by
the
bridge
she
was
holding
back
the
brim
of
her
brown
straw
hat
and
looking
up
at
my
dark
tower
here
i
am
mademoiselle
i
said
eagerly
are
you
coming
out
after
my
apprehension
of
the
last
two
days
so
much
condescension
made
me
think
to
use
the
accepted
formula
i
was
the
dupe
of
a
disordered
fancy
i
beg
your
pardon
what
did
you
say
will
you
come
out
for
a
little
with
alain
mervyn
and
me
with
pleasure
mademoiselle
very
your
album
i
went
down
quickly
and
hurried
to
the
bank
ah
ah
said
the
girl
laughing
you
re
in
a
this
morning
it
seems
i
awkwardly
murmured
something
to
the
effect
that
i
was
always
in
a
but
mlle
marguerite
scarcely
seemed
convinced
of
the
fact
then
i
stepped
into
the
boat
and
sat
down
at
her
side
row
away
alain
she
said
immediately
and
old
alain
who
prides
himself
on
being
a
oarsman
set
to
work
steadily
the
long
oars
moving
to
and
fro
at
his
sides
making
him
look
like
a
heavy
bird
trying
to
fly
i
was
obliged
to
come
and
save
you
from
your
donjon
said
mlle
marguerite
where
you
have
been
ailing
for
two
whole
days
mademoiselle
i
assure
you
that
only
consideration
for
of
respect
fear
oh
dear
no
you
were
sulking
that
is
all
we
behave
much
better
than
you
my
mother
for
some
reason
or
other
thinks
you
ought
to
be
treated
with
special
consideration
and
has
implored
me
to
sacrifice
myself
on
the
altar
of
your
pride
so
like
an
obedient
daughter
i
sacrifice
myself
i
expressed
my
gratitude
frankly
and
warmly
not
to
do
things
by
halves
she
continued
i
have
determined
to
give
you
a
treat
to
your
taste
so
here
you
have
a
lovely
summer
morning
woods
and
glades
with
all
the
proper
light
effects
birds
warbling
in
the
foliage
a
mysterious
bark
gliding
on
the
waves
as
this
is
the
sort
of
thing
you
like
you
ought
to
be
satisfied
mademoiselle
i
am
charmed
well
that
s
all
right
for
the
moment
i
was
fairly
contented
with
my
fate
the
air
was
sweet
with
the
scent
of
the
hay
lying
in
swaths
on
either
bank
the
sombre
avenues
of
the
park
dotted
with
patches
of
sunshine
slipped
past
us
and
from
the
came
the
happy
drone
of
myriads
of
insects
feasting
on
the
dew
opposite
me
old
alain
smiled
complacently
at
me
with
a
protecting
look
at
each
stroke
of
his
oars
and
closer
to
me
mlle
marguerite
dressed
in
to
her
and
fresh
and
pure
as
a
periwinkle
blossom
shook
with
one
hand
the
pearls
of
dew
from
her
veil
while
she
held
out
the
other
as
a
bait
for
mervyn
who
was
swimming
after
the
boat
i
should
not
have
wanted
much
persuasion
to
go
to
the
end
of
the
world
in
that
little
white
boat
as
we
passed
under
an
arch
in
the
wall
that
bounds
the
park
the
young
creole
said
to
me
you
do
not
ask
where
i
am
taking
you
no
mademoiselle
i
do
not
it
is
all
the
same
to
me
i
am
taking
you
into
fairyland
i
thought
so
mademoiselle
mlle
hélouin
more
versed
in
poetic
lore
than
i
am
has
no
doubt
told
you
that
the
thickets
that
cover
the
country
for
twenty
miles
round
are
the
remains
of
the
ancient
forest
of
brouliande
the
of
those
beings
of
gaël
ancestors
of
your
friend
mlle
de
porhoët
and
the
place
where
mervyn
s
ancestor
wizard
though
he
was
came
under
the
magic
spells
of
a
damsel
called
vivien
now
we
shall
soon
be
in
the
centre
of
that
forest
and
if
this
is
not
enough
to
fire
your
imagination
let
me
tell
you
that
these
woods
are
full
of
remains
of
the
mysterious
religion
of
the
celts
they
are
paved
with
them
in
every
shady
nook
you
picture
to
yourself
a
druid
and
in
every
ray
of
sunlight
the
glitter
of
a
golden
sickle
the
religion
of
these
old
bores
has
left
near
here
in
a
solitary
and
romantic
place
a
monument
before
which
people
subject
to
ecstasy
are
usually
in
raptures
i
thought
you
would
like
to
sketch
it
and
as
it
is
not
easy
to
find
i
will
show
you
the
way
on
condition
that
you
suppress
the
explosions
of
an
enthusiasm
i
can
not
share
agreed
mademoiselle
i
will
control
myself
yes
please
do
i
promise
and
what
is
the
name
of
this
monument
i
call
it
a
heap
of
big
stones
but
the
antiquaries
have
more
than
one
name
for
it
some
call
it
simply
a
others
more
pedantic
say
it
s
a
and
the
country
do
not
know
it
the
in
the
wood
of
cadoudal
morbihan
meanwhile
we
glided
gently
with
the
current
of
the
stream
between
two
strips
of
wet
meadow
here
and
there
small
black
cattle
with
large
pointed
horns
turned
and
looked
fiercely
at
us
the
valley
through
which
the
widening
river
crept
was
shut
in
on
both
sides
by
a
chain
of
hills
some
covered
with
dry
heather
and
furze
and
some
with
green
brushwood
sometimes
at
the
end
of
a
transversal
cleft
between
two
hills
we
could
see
the
crest
of
a
mountain
blue
and
round
in
the
distance
in
spite
of
her
indifference
mlle
marguerite
was
careful
to
draw
my
attention
to
all
the
beauties
of
this
austere
and
peaceful
country
and
careful
also
to
qualify
each
remark
with
some
ironic
comment
for
a
little
while
a
dull
continuous
sound
had
told
us
that
we
were
approaching
a
waterfall
suddenly
the
valley
narrowed
into
a
wild
and
lonely
gorge
on
the
left
stood
a
high
wall
of
rock
overgrown
with
moss
oaks
and
firs
mixed
with
ivy
and
straggling
brushwood
rose
one
above
the
other
in
every
crevice
till
they
reached
the
top
of
the
cliff
throwing
a
mysterious
shade
on
to
the
deeper
water
at
the
foot
of
the
rocks
a
hundred
paces
in
front
of
us
the
water
boiled
and
foamed
and
then
disappeared
all
at
once
and
the
broken
line
of
the
stream
stood
out
in
a
veil
of
white
spray
against
a
distant
background
of
vague
foliage
on
our
right
the
bank
opposite
to
the
cliff
had
only
a
narrow
margin
of
sloping
meadow
fringed
with
the
sombre
velvet
of
the
wooded
hills
land
alain
said
the
young
creole
alain
moored
the
boat
to
a
willow
now
sir
she
said
stepping
lightly
on
to
grass
aren
t
you
overcome
aren
t
you
troubled
petrified
thunderstruck
you
ought
to
be
for
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
very
pretty
place
i
like
it
because
it
is
always
fresh
and
cool
but
follow
me
through
the
you
are
not
too
much
i
will
show
you
the
famous
stones
bright
alert
and
gay
as
i
had
never
seen
her
before
mlle
marguerite
crossed
the
fields
with
a
bounding
step
and
took
a
path
which
led
along
the
hills
to
the
forest
alain
and
i
followed
in
indian
file
after
a
few
minutes
quick
walking
our
guide
stopped
and
seemed
to
hesitate
and
looked
about
her
for
a
moment
then
deliberately
separating
two
interlaced
branches
she
left
the
beaten
track
and
plunged
into
the
undergrowth
it
was
very
difficult
to
make
way
through
the
thicket
of
strong
young
oaks
whose
slanting
stems
and
twisted
branches
were
knotted
together
as
closely
as
robinson
crusoe
s
palisade
at
least
alain
and
i
bent
double
advanced
very
slowly
catching
our
heads
against
something
at
every
step
and
at
each
of
our
clumsy
movements
bringing
down
a
shower
of
dew
upon
us
but
mlle
marguerite
with
the
greater
dexterity
and
the
catlike
suppleness
of
her
sex
slipped
without
any
apparent
effort
through
the
meshes
of
the
labyrinth
laughing
at
our
sufferings
and
carelessly
letting
the
branches
spring
back
after
her
into
our
faces
at
last
we
reached
a
narrow
glade
on
the
top
of
the
hill
there
not
without
emotion
i
saw
the
dark
and
monstrous
table
of
stone
supported
by
five
or
six
huge
blocks
half
sunk
in
the
earth
forming
a
cavern
full
of
sacred
horror
at
first
sight
this
perfect
monument
of
a
time
almost
fabulous
and
of
a
primitive
religion
has
an
aspect
of
eternal
verity
and
of
a
real
mysterious
presence
that
takes
hold
of
the
imagination
and
fills
the
mind
with
awe
the
sunshine
streaming
through
the
leaves
stole
through
the
interstices
in
the
roughly
joined
blocks
played
about
the
sinister
slab
and
lent
an
idyllic
charm
to
this
barbarous
altar
even
mlle
marguerite
seemed
pensive
and
brooding
for
my
part
i
entered
the
cavern
and
after
examining
the
thoroughly
set
to
work
to
sketch
it
for
ten
minutes
i
had
been
absorbed
in
this
work
forgetting
everything
that
was
going
on
about
me
when
mlle
marguerite
suddenly
spoke
do
you
want
a
velleda
to
enliven
your
picture
i
looked
up
she
had
wound
a
wreath
of
round
her
forehead
and
stood
at
the
head
of
the
leaning
lightly
against
a
sheaf
of
saplings
in
the
under
the
branches
her
white
dress
looked
like
marble
and
her
eyes
shone
with
strange
fire
in
the
shadow
of
the
oaken
crown
she
was
beautiful
and
i
think
she
knew
it
i
looked
at
her
and
found
it
hard
to
speak
if
i
am
in
the
way
i
ll
move
she
said
oh
no
please
don
t
well
make
haste
put
mervyn
in
too
he
ll
be
the
druid
and
i
the
druidess
i
was
so
to
the
vagueness
of
a
to
reproduce
this
poetic
vision
pretty
faithfully
evidently
interested
she
came
and
looked
at
the
drawing
it
isn
t
bad
she
said
laughing
as
she
threw
her
crown
away
you
must
admit
that
i
am
very
good
to
you
i
did
i
might
even
have
added
if
she
had
asked
me
that
she
was
not
without
a
spice
of
coquetry
but
without
that
she
would
not
have
been
a
woman
perfection
is
detestable
and
even
goddesses
need
something
besides
their
deathless
beauty
to
win
love
we
went
back
through
the
tangled
underwood
to
the
path
in
the
wood
and
thence
returned
to
the
river
before
we
return
said
the
young
girl
i
want
to
show
you
the
waterfall
more
especially
as
i
am
looking
forward
to
a
little
diversion
on
my
own
account
come
mervyn
come
along
dear
dog
oh
you
are
lovely
we
soon
reached
the
bank
facing
the
rocks
which
blocked
the
bed
of
the
river
the
water
fell
from
a
height
of
many
feet
into
a
large
and
deeply
sunk
circular
basin
which
seemed
to
be
shut
in
on
all
sides
by
an
amphitheatre
of
vegetation
broken
by
dripping
rocks
but
there
were
unseen
outlets
for
the
overflow
of
the
little
lake
and
the
streams
so
formed
reunited
a
little
lower
down
it
is
not
exactly
a
niagara
said
mlle
marguerite
raising
her
voice
against
the
noise
of
the
falling
waters
but
i
have
heard
connoisseurs
and
artists
say
that
it
is
rather
pretty
nevertheless
have
you
admired
it
good
now
i
hope
you
ll
bestow
any
enthusiasm
you
may
have
left
on
mervyn
here
mervyn
the
newfoundland
ran
to
his
mistress
and
trembling
with
impatience
watched
her
while
she
tied
some
pebbles
into
her
handkerchief
she
threw
it
into
the
stream
a
little
above
the
fall
and
at
the
same
moment
mervyn
fell
like
a
block
into
the
lower
basin
and
struck
out
swiftly
from
the
edge
the
handkerchief
followed
the
current
reached
the
rocks
danced
in
an
eddy
for
a
minute
and
then
shooting
like
an
arrow
past
the
smooth
rock
swept
in
a
mass
of
foam
under
the
eyes
of
the
dog
who
seized
it
dexterously
in
his
mouth
after
which
mervyn
returned
proudly
to
the
bank
where
mlle
marguerite
stood
clapping
her
hands
this
feat
was
performed
several
times
with
great
success
at
the
sixth
repetition
either
because
the
dog
started
too
late
or
because
the
handkerchief
was
thrown
too
soon
mervyn
missed
it
the
handkerchief
swept
on
by
the
eddies
from
the
fall
was
carried
among
some
thorny
brushwood
that
overhung
the
water
a
little
farther
on
mervyn
went
to
fetch
it
but
we
were
very
much
surprised
to
see
him
suddenly
struggle
convulsively
drop
his
booty
and
raise
his
head
towards
us
howling
pitifully
my
god
what
has
happened
exclaimed
mlle
marguerite
he
seems
to
be
caught
among
the
bushes
he
ll
free
himself
directly
no
doubt
but
soon
one
had
to
doubt
and
even
to
despair
of
this
issue
the
network
of
creepers
in
which
the
dog
had
been
caught
lay
directly
below
one
of
the
mouths
of
the
sluice
which
poured
a
mass
of
seething
water
continuously
on
mervyn
s
head
the
poor
beast
ceased
to
make
the
slightest
effort
to
release
himself
and
his
plaintive
cries
sounded
more
and
more
like
a
at
this
moment
mlle
marguerite
seized
my
arm
and
whispered
almost
in
my
ear
he
is
lost
it
s
no
use
let
us
go
i
looked
at
her
grief
pain
and
her
violent
effort
to
control
herself
had
distorted
her
pale
features
and
brought
dark
circles
under
her
eyes
it
is
impossible
i
said
to
get
the
boat
down
there
but
if
you
will
allow
me
i
can
swim
a
little
and
i
ll
go
and
give
a
hand
to
the
poor
fellow
no
no
don
t
attempt
it
it
s
too
far
and
they
say
it
s
very
deep
and
dangerous
under
the
fall
you
needn
t
fear
mademoiselle
i
am
very
cautious
at
the
same
moment
i
took
off
my
coat
and
went
into
the
water
taking
care
to
keep
a
good
distance
from
the
fall
it
was
very
deep
and
i
did
not
find
a
footing
till
i
reached
the
exhausted
mervyn
i
do
not
know
whether
there
had
been
an
islet
here
which
had
dwindled
and
crumbled
away
or
whether
a
sudden
rising
of
the
river
had
swept
away
part
of
the
bank
and
deposited
the
fragments
in
this
place
but
whatever
the
cause
there
was
an
accumulated
and
flourishing
mass
of
entangled
brushwood
and
roots
under
this
treacherous
water
i
got
my
feet
on
a
trunk
from
which
the
bushes
seemed
to
spring
and
managed
to
release
mervyn
feeling
himself
free
he
recovered
at
once
and
struck
out
for
the
bank
leaving
me
to
my
fate
with
all
the
goodwill
imaginable
this
was
scarcely
acting
up
to
the
chivalrous
reputation
of
his
breed
but
mervyn
has
lived
a
long
while
among
men
and
i
suppose
has
become
a
bit
of
a
philosopher
but
when
i
tried
to
follow
him
i
found
to
my
disgust
that
in
my
turn
i
was
caught
in
the
nets
of
the
jealous
and
malignant
naiad
who
reigns
in
the
pool
one
of
my
legs
was
entangled
in
the
creepers
and
i
could
not
free
it
it
is
difficult
to
exert
all
one
s
strength
in
deep
water
and
on
a
bed
of
sticky
mud
and
besides
i
was
by
the
bubbling
spray
in
short
my
situation
was
becoming
awkward
i
looked
towards
the
bank
mlle
marguerite
holding
to
alain
s
arm
hung
over
the
gulf
and
watched
me
with
mortal
anxiety
i
told
myself
that
it
rested
with
me
to
be
wept
for
by
those
bright
eyes
and
to
end
a
miserable
existence
in
an
enviable
fashion
then
i
shook
off
such
maudlin
fancies
vigorously
and
freed
myself
by
a
violent
effort
i
tied
the
little
handkerchief
now
in
rags
round
my
neck
and
easily
regained
the
shore
as
i
landed
mlle
marguerite
offered
me
her
hand
it
trembled
a
little
and
i
was
pleased
what
rashness
you
might
have
been
drowned
and
for
a
dog
it
was
yours
i
whispered
in
the
same
low
tone
she
had
used
to
me
this
speech
seemed
to
annoy
her
she
withdrew
her
hand
quickly
and
turning
to
mervyn
who
lay
yawning
and
drying
himself
in
the
sun
began
to
punish
him
oh
the
stupid
the
big
stupid
she
said
what
an
idiot
he
is
but
the
water
was
streaming
from
my
clothes
on
to
the
grass
i
did
not
quite
know
what
to
do
with
myself
till
mlle
marguerite
came
back
and
said
very
kindly
take
the
boat
maxime
and
get
away
as
fast
as
you
can
you
ll
keep
warm
rowing
i
will
come
back
with
alain
through
the
wood
it
is
the
shortest
way
i
agreed
to
this
arrangement
which
was
in
every
way
the
best
i
said
farewell
touched
her
hand
for
the
second
time
and
got
into
the
boat
to
my
surprise
when
i
was
dressing
at
home
i
found
the
little
handkerchief
still
round
my
neck
i
had
forgotten
to
restore
it
to
mlle
marguerite
who
must
have
given
it
up
for
lost
so
i
shamelessly
determined
to
keep
it
as
the
reward
of
my
watery
adventure
i
went
to
the
château
in
the
evening
mlle
laroque
received
me
with
her
habitual
air
of
disdainful
indolence
sombre
preoccupation
and
embittered
which
was
in
singular
contrast
with
the
gracious
friendliness
and
playful
vivacity
of
my
companion
of
the
morning
during
dinner
at
which
de
bévallan
was
present
she
spoke
of
our
excursion
in
a
manner
that
stripped
it
of
all
sentiment
and
as
she
went
on
said
some
sharp
things
about
lovers
of
nature
and
finished
with
an
account
of
mervyn
s
misadventure
without
mentioning
my
share
in
it
if
as
i
thought
this
was
meant
as
a
hint
of
the
line
i
was
to
take
the
young
lady
had
been
at
needless
trouble
however
that
may
be
de
bévallan
on
hearing
the
story
nearly
deafened
us
with
his
cries
of
despair
what
mlle
marguerite
had
endured
such
anxiety
the
brave
mervyn
had
been
in
such
danger
and
he
bévallan
had
not
been
there
cruel
fate
he
would
never
get
over
it
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
do
but
hang
himself
like
crillon
well
said
alain
if
it
depended
on
me
to
cut
him
down
i
should
take
my
time
about
it
the
next
day
did
not
begin
so
pleasantly
for
me
as
its
predecessor
in
the
morning
i
received
a
letter
from
madrid
asking
me
to
inform
mlle
de
porhoët
that
her
lawsuit
was
finally
lost
her
agent
also
informed
me
that
her
opponents
would
not
profit
by
their
victory
as
the
crown
attracted
by
the
millions
at
stake
claimed
to
succeed
under
the
law
by
which
the
property
escheats
to
the
state
after
careful
consideration
i
decided
that
it
would
be
kinder
not
to
let
my
old
friend
know
of
the
total
destruction
of
her
hopes
i
intend
therefore
to
secure
the
assistance
of
her
agent
in
spain
he
will
allege
further
delays
and
on
my
side
i
shall
continue
my
researches
among
the
archives
and
do
my
best
to
preserve
the
poor
soul
s
cherished
delusions
to
the
end
however
innocent
and
legitimate
this
deception
might
be
i
could
not
feel
at
rest
until
it
had
been
approved
by
some
one
whose
judgment
in
such
matters
i
could
trust
i
went
to
the
château
in
the
afternoon
and
made
confession
to
mme
laroque
who
approved
of
my
plan
and
commended
me
rather
more
than
the
occasion
warranted
and
to
my
great
surprise
she
finished
the
interview
with
these
words
i
must
take
this
opportunity
of
telling
you
odiot
that
i
am
deeply
grateful
for
your
devotion
to
my
interests
that
each
day
i
appreciate
your
character
more
truly
and
enjoy
your
company
more
thoroughly
i
could
must
forgive
my
saying
it
as
you
are
scarcely
likely
to
share
my
could
wish
that
you
could
always
remain
with
us
and
i
humbly
pray
heaven
to
perform
the
miracles
necessary
to
bring
this
about
for
i
know
that
only
miracles
can
do
so
i
did
not
quite
grasp
the
meaning
of
this
language
nor
could
i
explain
the
sudden
emotion
that
shone
in
the
eyes
of
the
excellent
lady
i
acknowledged
her
kindness
properly
and
went
away
to
indulge
my
melancholy
in
the
fields
by
an
purely
fortuitous
i
must
found
myself
after
an
hour
s
walking
in
a
deserted
valley
and
on
the
brink
of
the
pool
which
had
been
the
scene
of
my
recent
prowess
the
amphitheatre
of
rocks
and
greenery
which
surrounds
the
small
lake
realizes
the
very
ideal
of
solitude
there
you
are
at
the
end
of
the
world
in
a
virgin
country
in
you
will
i
lay
down
among
the
heather
recalling
my
expedition
of
yesterday
one
not
likely
to
occur
again
in
the
course
of
the
longest
life
already
i
felt
that
if
such
good
fortune
should
come
to
me
a
second
time
it
would
not
have
that
charm
of
surprise
of
peacefulness
one
innocence
i
had
to
own
that
this
fresh
romance
of
youth
which
gave
a
perfume
to
my
thoughts
could
have
but
one
chapter
one
page
and
that
i
had
read
it
yes
this
hour
this
hour
of
love
to
call
it
by
its
true
name
had
been
royally
sweet
because
it
had
not
been
premeditated
because
i
had
not
known
what
it
was
till
it
had
gone
because
i
had
had
the
rapture
and
had
been
spared
remorse
now
my
conscience
was
awake
i
saw
myself
on
the
verge
of
an
impossible
a
ridiculous
love
and
worse
of
a
culpable
passion
poor
and
disinherited
as
i
am
it
is
time
to
keep
a
strict
watch
over
myself
i
was
addressing
these
warnings
to
myself
in
this
solitary
other
would
have
served
my
purpose
as
the
sound
of
voices
interrupted
my
reflections
i
rose
and
saw
a
company
of
four
or
five
people
who
had
just
landed
advancing
towards
me
first
came
mlle
marguerite
leaning
on
de
bévallan
s
arm
next
mlle
hélouin
and
mme
aubry
followed
by
alain
and
mervyn
the
sound
of
their
approach
had
been
drowned
in
the
roar
of
the
waterfall
they
were
only
a
few
yards
off
there
was
no
time
for
retreat
so
i
had
to
resign
myself
to
being
discovered
in
the
character
of
the
romantic
recluse
but
my
presence
did
not
excite
any
particular
attention
though
i
saw
a
shadow
of
annoyance
on
mlle
marguerite
s
face
and
she
returned
my
bow
with
marked
stiffness
de
bévallan
standing
at
the
verge
of
the
pool
wearied
the
echoes
with
the
clamour
of
his
conventional
admiration
delicious
how
picturesque
what
a
feast
the
pen
of
george
sand
the
pencil
of
salvator
rosa
all
this
was
accompanied
by
violent
gestures
by
which
he
appeared
to
be
snatching
from
these
great
artists
the
instruments
of
their
genius
at
last
he
became
calmer
and
asked
to
be
shown
the
dangerous
channel
where
mervyn
had
nearly
been
drowned
again
mlle
marguerite
related
the
adventure
and
again
she
suppressed
the
part
i
had
taken
in
the
denouement
with
a
kind
of
cruelty
evidently
levelled
at
me
she
enlarged
on
the
cleverness
courage
and
presence
of
mind
her
dog
had
shown
in
his
trying
situation
apparently
she
seemed
to
think
that
her
transient
and
the
service
i
had
been
so
fortunate
as
to
render
her
had
filled
my
head
with
some
presumptuous
notions
which
it
was
necessary
to
nip
in
the
bud
as
mlle
hélouin
and
mme
aubry
particularly
wished
to
see
mervyn
repeat
his
wonderful
exploit
his
mistress
called
the
newfoundland
and
as
before
threw
her
handkerchief
into
the
current
but
at
the
signal
the
brave
mervyn
instead
of
jumping
into
the
lake
rushed
up
and
down
the
bank
barking
furiously
lashing
about
with
his
tail
showing
in
fact
the
greatest
interest
in
the
proceedings
but
at
the
same
time
an
excellent
memory
evidently
the
head
controls
the
heart
in
this
sagacious
beast
in
vain
mlle
marguerite
angry
and
confused
first
tried
caresses
and
then
threats
to
overcome
her
favourite
s
obstinacy
nothing
could
persuade
the
intelligent
creature
to
trust
himself
again
in
those
dangerous
waters
after
such
announcements
mervyn
s
stubborn
prudence
was
really
amusing
i
had
a
better
right
to
laugh
than
any
one
present
and
i
did
so
without
compunction
besides
the
merriment
soon
became
general
and
in
the
end
mlle
marguerite
herself
joined
in
rather
and
now
she
said
i
ve
lost
another
handkerchief
the
handkerchief
carried
along
by
the
eddies
had
naturally
landed
among
the
branches
of
the
fatal
bush
not
far
from
the
further
bank
rely
upon
me
mademoiselle
cried
de
bévallan
in
ten
minutes
you
shall
have
your
handkerchief
or
i
shall
exist
no
longer
at
this
magnanimous
declaration
i
thought
that
mlle
marguerite
looked
stealthily
at
me
as
much
as
to
say
you
see
there
are
others
who
are
devoted
to
me
then
she
answered
de
bévallan
for
heaven
s
sake
don
t
be
so
foolish
the
water
is
very
deep
it
is
really
dangerous
it
is
all
the
same
to
me
said
de
bévallan
have
you
a
knife
alain
a
knife
said
mlle
marguerite
surprised
yes
a
knife
please
allow
me
i
know
what
i
mean
to
do
but
what
do
you
mean
to
do
with
a
knife
i
mean
to
cut
a
switch
said
de
bévallan
the
girl
looked
at
him
gravely
i
thought
she
murmured
that
you
were
going
to
swim
for
it
to
swim
said
de
bévallan
excuse
me
mademoiselle
firstly
i
am
not
in
swimming
costume
next
i
must
admit
that
i
can
not
swim
if
you
can
not
swim
she
said
dryly
the
question
of
costume
is
not
important
you
are
quite
right
said
de
bévallan
with
amusing
coolness
but
you
are
not
particularly
anxious
that
i
should
drown
myself
are
you
you
want
your
handkerchief
that
is
the
point
when
i
have
got
it
you
will
be
satisfied
isn
t
that
so
well
go
and
cut
your
switch
she
said
sitting
down
resignedly
de
bévallan
is
not
easily
disconcerted
he
disappeared
into
the
nearest
thicket
and
soon
we
heard
the
branches
crack
he
came
back
armed
with
a
long
switch
from
a
and
proceeded
to
strip
the
leaves
off
do
you
think
you
ll
reach
the
other
side
with
that
stick
asked
mlle
marguerite
who
was
beginning
to
be
amused
allow
me
to
manage
it
my
own
way
that
is
all
i
ask
said
the
imperturbable
gentleman
we
left
him
alone
he
finished
his
switch
and
then
set
out
for
the
boat
we
at
last
understood
that
he
meant
to
cross
the
river
in
the
boat
to
land
above
the
waterfall
and
to
harpoon
the
handkerchief
which
he
could
easily
do
from
the
bank
at
this
discovery
there
was
an
indignant
outcry
from
the
ladies
who
as
we
all
know
are
extremely
fond
of
dangerous
which
they
are
not
themselves
concerned
a
pretty
contrivance
de
bévallan
aren
t
you
ashamed
of
yourself
ladies
remember
columbus
and
the
egg
the
idea
is
everything
you
know
contrary
to
our
expectation
this
apparently
harmless
expedition
was
not
to
be
carried
through
without
some
emotions
and
some
risks
for
de
bévallan
instead
of
making
for
the
bank
immediately
opposite
the
little
bay
where
the
boat
had
been
moored
unluckily
decided
to
land
nearer
the
cataract
he
pushed
the
boat
into
the
middle
of
the
stream
and
let
it
drift
for
a
moment
till
he
saw
that
as
the
river
approached
the
fall
its
pace
increased
with
alarming
rapidity
we
appreciated
the
danger
when
we
saw
him
put
the
boat
across
the
current
and
begin
to
row
with
feverish
energy
for
a
few
seconds
he
struggled
with
doubtful
success
but
little
by
little
he
got
nearer
to
the
bank
though
the
stream
still
swept
him
fiercely
towards
the
cataract
which
thundered
ominously
in
his
ears
he
was
only
a
few
feet
from
it
when
a
supreme
effort
brought
him
near
enough
to
the
shore
to
put
him
out
of
danger
with
a
vigorous
spring
he
leaped
on
to
the
slope
of
the
bank
sending
the
boat
out
among
the
rocks
where
it
was
at
once
overturned
it
presently
floated
into
the
pool
keel
upward
while
the
danger
lasted
our
only
feeling
was
one
of
keen
anxiety
but
when
it
was
over
the
contrast
between
the
comic
and
its
hero
s
usual
coolness
and
could
not
fail
to
tickle
our
sense
of
humour
besides
laughter
is
a
natural
relief
when
a
danger
is
happily
past
directly
we
saw
that
de
bévallan
was
out
of
the
boat
we
all
gave
ourselves
up
to
unrestrained
merriment
i
should
say
that
at
this
moment
his
bad
luck
was
completed
by
a
truly
distressing
detail
the
bank
on
which
he
had
jumped
sloped
sharply
and
was
very
wet
his
feet
had
scarcely
touched
it
when
he
fell
backwards
fortunately
there
were
some
strong
branches
within
his
reach
he
hung
on
to
them
desperately
his
legs
beating
the
shallow
water
like
two
angry
oars
as
there
was
no
danger
his
situation
became
purely
ridiculous
and
i
suppose
that
this
thought
made
him
struggle
so
frantically
and
awkwardly
that
his
efforts
defeated
their
purpose
he
succeeded
however
in
raising
himself
and
getting
another
footing
on
the
slope
then
all
of
a
sudden
we
saw
him
slide
down
again
tearing
the
bushes
and
brushwood
as
he
went
and
renewing
his
wild
pantomime
in
the
water
in
evident
desperation
it
was
irresistible
never
i
believe
had
mlle
marguerite
been
at
such
an
entertainment
she
had
utterly
lost
all
care
for
her
dignity
like
some
mirthful
bacchante
she
filled
all
the
grove
with
bursts
of
almost
convulsive
gaiety
between
her
shouts
of
laughter
she
clapped
her
hands
and
called
out
in
a
voice
bravo
bravo
de
bévallan
very
pretty
delicious
picturesque
salvator
rosa
at
last
de
bévallan
succeeded
in
dragging
himself
to
then
turning
to
the
ladies
he
made
them
a
speech
which
the
noise
of
the
waterfall
prevented
us
from
hearing
distinctly
but
from
his
animated
gestures
the
illustrative
movements
of
his
arms
and
his
air
of
forced
we
understood
that
he
was
giving
us
a
reasoned
explanation
of
his
disaster
yes
yes
replied
mlle
marguerite
continuing
to
laugh
with
a
woman
s
implacable
barbarity
it
was
a
great
success
i
congratulate
you
when
she
was
a
little
more
serious
she
asked
me
how
we
should
recover
the
capsized
boat
which
was
the
best
we
had
i
promised
to
bring
some
men
the
next
day
and
superintend
the
rescue
then
we
struck
across
the
fields
towards
the
château
de
bévallan
not
being
in
swimming
costume
could
not
rejoin
us
with
a
melancholy
air
he
disappeared
behind
the
rocks
above
the
farther
bank
at
last
this
extraordinary
girl
has
revealed
the
secret
of
her
stormy
soul
to
me
would
that
she
had
preserved
it
forever
during
the
day
that
followed
the
scenes
i
have
just
described
mlle
marguerite
as
if
ashamed
of
the
impulses
of
youthful
frankness
to
which
she
had
yielded
wrapped
herself
more
closely
than
ever
in
her
veil
of
mournful
pride
disdain
and
mistrust
in
the
midst
of
the
noisy
pleasures
the
and
dances
that
succeeded
one
another
she
passed
like
a
ghost
indifferent
icy
and
sometimes
angry
her
irony
vented
itself
with
inconceivable
bitterness
sometimes
on
the
purest
pleasures
of
the
mind
those
that
come
from
contemplation
and
study
sometimes
on
the
noblest
and
most
sacred
sentiments
if
an
instance
of
courage
or
virtue
was
mentioned
in
her
presence
she
examined
it
minutely
in
search
of
its
selfish
motive
or
if
by
chance
one
burned
the
smallest
grain
of
incense
on
the
altar
of
art
she
extinguished
it
with
a
disdainful
wave
of
her
hand
with
her
short
abrupt
and
terrible
laugh
like
the
mocking
of
a
fallen
angel
she
seemed
determined
to
blight
wherever
she
saw
a
trace
of
them
the
most
generous
faculties
of
the
human
and
passion
i
noticed
that
this
strange
spirit
of
disparagement
took
on
a
special
character
of
directed
against
me
i
did
not
understand
and
even
now
i
do
not
quite
understand
why
i
have
attracted
these
particular
attentions
true
i
carry
in
my
heart
the
worship
of
things
ideal
and
eternal
which
only
death
can
tear
from
me
great
god
what
would
be
left
me
if
i
had
not
that
but
i
am
not
given
to
public
ecstasies
and
my
admiration
like
my
love
will
never
be
obtrusive
in
vain
i
maintained
more
scrupulously
than
ever
the
modesty
which
springs
from
real
feeling
i
gained
nothing
by
it
the
most
romantic
fancies
were
attributed
to
me
just
for
the
pleasure
of
combating
them
and
perpetually
some
kind
of
grotesque
harp
was
thrust
into
my
hands
solely
for
the
amusement
of
breaking
its
strings
although
this
open
warfare
against
anything
higher
than
the
material
interests
and
sordid
realities
of
life
was
not
a
new
trait
in
mlle
marguerite
s
character
it
had
been
suddenly
exaggerated
and
embittered
to
the
point
of
wounding
the
hearts
most
devoted
to
this
young
girl
one
day
mlle
de
porhoët
weary
of
this
incessant
mocking
said
to
her
in
my
presence
my
darling
for
some
time
past
you
have
been
possessed
by
a
devil
which
you
would
do
well
to
cast
out
as
soon
as
possible
or
you
will
finish
by
making
up
a
trio
with
mme
aubry
and
mme
de
for
my
part
i
do
not
pride
myself
on
being
or
ever
having
been
particularly
romantic
but
i
like
to
think
that
there
are
still
some
people
in
the
world
who
are
capable
of
generous
sentiments
i
believe
in
disinterestedness
if
only
in
my
own
and
i
even
believe
in
heroism
because
i
have
known
heroes
more
i
love
to
hear
the
little
birds
singing
under
my
arbour
and
i
like
to
build
my
cathedral
in
the
drifting
clouds
all
this
may
sound
very
ridiculous
my
dear
but
i
venture
to
remind
you
that
these
illusions
are
the
riches
of
the
poor
that
odiot
and
i
have
no
other
kind
of
wealth
and
that
we
are
so
singular
as
not
to
complain
on
another
occasion
when
i
had
just
received
mlle
marguerite
s
sarcasm
with
my
usual
impassibility
her
mother
drew
me
aside
maxime
she
said
my
daughter
teases
you
a
little
but
i
hope
you
will
excuse
her
you
must
have
noticed
that
she
has
changed
very
much
lately
your
daughter
seems
to
be
more
preoccupied
than
usual
and
not
without
good
reason
she
is
about
to
come
to
a
very
serious
decision
and
at
such
a
moment
young
girls
are
apt
to
be
capricious
i
bowed
and
said
nothing
you
are
now
a
friend
of
the
family
continued
mme
laroque
and
as
such
i
ask
you
to
give
me
your
opinion
of
de
bévallan
i
believe
madame
that
de
bévallan
has
a
very
handsome
so
large
as
yours
but
undeniably
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
a
year
yes
but
what
do
you
think
of
him
personally
and
of
his
character
de
bévallan
is
what
the
world
calls
a
perfect
gentleman
he
has
wit
he
is
considered
an
honourable
man
but
do
you
think
he
will
make
my
daughter
happy
i
do
not
think
he
will
make
her
unhappy
he
is
not
unkind
what
do
you
think
i
ought
to
do
i
am
not
entirely
satisfied
with
him
but
he
is
the
only
one
marguerite
at
all
cares
for
and
there
are
so
few
men
with
a
hundred
thousand
francs
a
year
you
can
understand
that
my
her
had
plenty
of
offers
for
the
last
two
or
three
years
we
have
been
literally
besieged
well
it
is
time
we
decided
i
am
not
strong
i
may
go
any
day
my
daughter
would
be
unprotected
here
is
an
unexceptionable
suitor
whom
the
world
will
certainly
is
my
duty
to
welcome
him
already
people
say
that
i
have
filled
my
daughter
s
head
with
romantic
is
not
the
truth
she
has
her
own
ideas
now
what
do
you
advise
me
to
do
may
i
ask
what
is
mlle
de
porhoët
s
opinion
she
is
a
lady
of
great
judgment
and
experience
and
besides
entirely
devoted
to
you
oh
if
i
listened
to
mlle
de
porhoët
i
should
send
de
bévallan
about
his
business
but
it
is
all
very
well
for
mlle
de
porhoët
to
talk
when
he
s
gone
she
won
t
marry
my
daughter
for
me
but
madame
from
the
monetary
point
of
view
de
bévallan
is
certainly
a
fine
match
i
do
not
dispute
it
for
a
moment
and
if
you
stand
out
for
a
hundred
thousand
francs
a
year
but
my
dear
sir
i
care
no
more
for
a
hundred
thousand
francs
than
for
a
hundred
pence
however
i
am
not
talking
of
myself
but
of
my
daughter
well
i
can
t
let
her
marry
a
mason
can
i
i
should
have
rather
liked
to
be
the
wife
of
a
mason
but
it
does
not
follow
that
what
would
have
made
me
happy
would
make
her
so
i
ought
in
marrying
her
to
be
guided
by
received
opinion
not
merely
by
my
own
well
then
madame
if
this
marriage
suits
you
and
suits
your
daughter
equally
well
ah
no
it
does
not
suit
me
nor
does
it
suit
my
daughter
any
better
it
is
a
marriage
to
speak
plainly
it
is
mariage
de
am
i
to
understand
that
it
is
quite
settled
no
or
i
should
scarcely
ask
your
advice
if
it
were
my
daughter
would
be
more
at
ease
her
misgivings
disturb
her
and
then
mme
laroque
sank
back
into
the
shadow
of
the
hood
over
her
chair
and
added
have
any
idea
of
what
is
going
on
in
that
unfortunate
head
none
madame
she
fixed
her
sparkling
eyes
on
me
for
a
moment
sighed
deeply
and
said
gently
and
sadly
you
may
go
i
won
t
detain
you
any
longer
the
confidence
with
which
i
had
just
been
honoured
had
not
surprised
me
much
for
some
time
it
had
been
evident
that
mlle
marguerite
reserved
for
de
bévallan
whatever
sympathy
she
had
left
for
humanity
but
she
seemed
to
show
rather
a
friendly
preference
than
an
impassioned
tenderness
and
i
ought
to
say
that
the
preference
was
quite
intelligible
i
have
never
liked
de
bévallan
and
in
these
pages
i
have
in
spite
of
myself
given
a
caricature
rather
than
a
portrait
of
him
but
i
admit
that
he
combines
most
of
the
qualities
and
defects
that
are
popular
with
women
he
is
absolutely
devoid
of
modesty
which
is
a
great
advantage
as
women
do
not
like
it
he
has
the
cool
mocking
and
witty
assurance
which
nothing
can
daunt
which
easily
daunts
others
and
which
gives
to
its
possessor
a
kind
of
domination
and
a
factitious
superiority
his
tall
figure
his
bold
features
his
skill
in
athletic
exercises
his
reputation
as
a
sportsman
give
him
a
manly
authority
which
impresses
the
timid
sex
and
he
has
an
air
of
daring
enterprise
and
conquest
which
attracts
and
troubles
women
and
fills
their
souls
with
secret
ardour
such
advantages
it
is
true
are
as
a
rule
chiefly
impressive
to
vulgar
natures
but
though
as
usual
i
had
at
first
been
tempted
to
put
mlle
marguerite
s
nature
on
a
level
with
her
beauty
she
had
for
some
time
past
seemed
to
make
a
positive
parade
of
very
mediocre
sentiments
and
i
believed
she
was
capable
of
yielding
without
resistance
as
without
enthusiasm
and
with
the
passive
coldness
of
a
lifeless
imagination
to
the
charms
of
a
and
later
to
the
yoke
of
a
respectable
marriage
ah
this
made
it
necessary
for
me
to
accept
the
inevitable
and
i
did
so
more
easily
than
i
should
have
thought
possible
a
month
ago
for
i
had
summoned
all
my
courage
to
combat
the
first
temptations
of
a
love
equally
condemned
by
good
sense
and
by
honour
and
she
who
had
unwittingly
imposed
this
combat
on
me
had
also
unwittingly
powerfully
helped
me
in
my
resistance
if
she
could
not
hide
her
beauty
from
me
she
also
unveiled
her
soul
and
mine
had
recoiled
small
loss
no
doubt
for
the
young
millionaire
but
a
good
thing
for
me
meanwhile
i
had
to
go
to
paris
partly
on
mme
laroque
s
business
and
partly
on
my
own
i
returned
two
days
ago
and
as
i
arrived
at
the
château
i
was
told
that
old
laroque
had
repeatedly
asked
for
me
since
the
morning
i
hurried
to
his
apartment
a
smile
flickered
across
his
withered
cheeks
as
he
saw
me
he
looked
at
me
with
an
expression
of
malignant
joy
and
secret
triumph
then
he
said
in
his
dull
hollow
voice
de
is
dead
this
news
which
the
strange
old
man
had
wanted
to
tell
me
himself
was
correct
on
the
previous
night
poor
general
de
had
had
a
stroke
of
apoplexy
and
an
hour
later
had
been
snatched
from
the
life
of
wealth
and
luxury
which
he
owed
to
his
wife
directly
the
news
came
to
the
château
mme
aubry
had
started
off
to
her
friend
and
the
two
had
as
desmarets
told
us
passed
the
day
chanting
a
sort
of
litany
of
original
and
piquant
ideas
on
the
subject
of
swiftness
with
which
it
strikes
its
prey
the
impossibility
of
preventing
or
guarding
against
it
the
futility
of
regrets
which
can
not
bring
back
the
departed
the
consoling
effects
of
time
etc
after
which
they
sat
down
to
dinner
and
gradually
recovered
their
spirits
madame
said
mme
aubry
you
must
eat
you
must
keep
yourself
alive
it
is
our
duty
and
the
will
of
god
at
dessert
mme
de
had
a
bottle
of
the
poor
general
s
favourite
spanish
wine
and
begged
mme
aubry
to
taste
it
for
his
sake
but
as
mme
aubry
firmly
refused
to
be
the
only
one
to
partake
of
it
mme
de
allowed
herself
to
be
persuaded
that
god
also
wished
her
to
have
a
glass
of
spanish
wine
and
a
crust
of
bread
the
general
s
health
was
not
drunk
early
yesterday
morning
mme
laroque
and
her
daughter
both
in
mourning
took
their
places
in
the
carriage
i
accompanied
them
about
ten
o
clock
we
were
at
the
little
town
while
i
attended
the
general
s
funeral
the
ladies
joined
the
widow
s
circle
of
official
sympathizers
after
the
service
i
returned
to
the
house
and
with
some
other
friends
i
was
introduced
into
the
famous
the
furniture
of
which
had
cost
fifteen
thousand
francs
in
the
funereal
i
distinguished
the
inconsolable
mme
de
sitting
on
a
sofa
enveloped
in
crape
the
price
of
which
we
were
told
before
long
at
her
side
was
mme
aubry
an
image
of
physical
and
moral
prostration
half
a
dozen
friends
and
relatives
completed
this
doleful
group
as
we
took
up
our
positions
in
line
at
the
farther
end
of
the
there
was
a
sound
of
shuffling
feet
and
some
cracking
of
the
parquet
then
gloomy
silence
fell
again
on
this
mausoleum
only
from
time
to
time
a
lamentable
sigh
faithfully
echoed
by
mme
aubry
rose
from
the
sofa
at
last
a
young
man
appeared
he
had
lingered
in
the
street
to
finish
the
cigar
he
had
lighted
as
he
left
the
cemetery
as
he
slipped
discreetly
into
our
ranks
mme
de
perceived
him
is
that
you
arthur
she
said
in
a
lugubrious
voice
yes
aunt
said
the
young
man
advancing
in
front
of
the
line
well
continued
the
widow
in
the
same
plaintive
drawl
is
it
over
yes
aunt
said
arthur
in
curt
deliberate
accents
he
seemed
to
be
a
young
man
who
was
perfectly
satisfied
with
himself
there
was
a
pause
after
which
mme
de
drew
from
the
depths
of
her
expiring
soul
this
new
series
of
questions
did
it
go
off
well
very
well
aunt
very
well
were
there
many
people
the
whole
town
aunt
the
whole
town
the
military
yes
aunt
the
whole
garrison
and
the
band
mme
de
groaned
and
added
the
fire
brigade
the
fire
brigade
too
i
do
not
quite
see
why
this
last
detail
should
have
particularly
affected
mme
de
but
she
could
not
resist
it
a
sudden
swoon
accompanied
by
infantile
wailings
summoned
all
the
resources
of
feminine
sensibility
to
her
aid
and
gave
us
the
opportunity
of
slipping
away
i
was
glad
of
it
i
could
not
bear
to
see
this
ridiculous
vixen
performing
her
hypocritical
mummeries
over
the
tomb
of
the
weak
but
good
and
loyal
fellow
whose
life
she
had
embittered
and
whose
end
she
had
probably
hastened
a
few
moments
later
mme
laroque
asked
me
to
accompany
her
to
the
langoat
farm
five
or
six
leagues
farther
on
towards
the
coast
she
intended
to
dine
there
with
her
daughter
the
farmer
s
wife
who
had
been
mlle
marguerite
s
nurse
was
ill
and
the
ladies
had
for
some
time
meant
to
give
her
this
proof
of
their
interest
in
her
welfare
we
started
at
two
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
it
was
one
of
the
hottest
days
of
this
hot
summer
through
the
open
windows
of
the
carriage
the
heavy
burning
gusts
which
rose
in
waves
from
the
parched
under
the
torrid
sky
swept
across
us
the
conversation
suffered
from
our
oppression
mme
laroque
who
declared
that
she
was
in
paradise
had
at
last
thrown
off
her
furs
and
remained
sunk
in
a
gentle
ecstasy
mlle
marguerite
fanned
herself
with
spanish
gravity
while
we
slowly
climbed
the
interminable
hills
we
saw
the
calcined
rocks
swarming
with
legions
of
lizards
and
heard
the
continuous
crackling
of
the
furze
opening
its
ripe
pods
to
the
sun
in
the
middle
of
one
of
our
laborious
ascents
a
voice
suddenly
called
out
from
the
side
of
the
road
stop
if
you
please
at
the
same
time
a
big
girl
with
bare
legs
holding
a
distaff
in
her
hand
and
wearing
the
ancient
costume
and
ducal
coif
of
the
peasants
of
this
country
leaped
quickly
across
the
ditch
knocking
over
as
she
came
along
some
of
the
sheep
she
was
tending
she
perched
herself
with
a
kind
of
grace
on
the
and
stood
before
us
with
her
brown
and
smiling
face
framed
in
the
window
pardon
ladies
she
said
in
the
quick
melodious
tones
of
her
country
will
you
be
so
kind
as
to
read
this
to
me
she
took
from
her
bodice
a
letter
folded
in
the
ancient
fashion
read
it
odiot
said
mme
laroque
laughing
and
read
it
aloud
if
necessary
it
was
a
addressed
very
carefully
to
mlle
christine
ogadec
s
farm
in
the
commune
of
near
it
was
written
by
an
awkward
but
sincere
hand
the
date
showed
that
mlle
christine
had
received
it
two
or
three
weeks
ago
not
being
able
to
read
and
fearing
to
trust
her
secret
to
the
of
her
associates
the
poor
girl
had
kept
the
letter
in
the
hope
that
some
passing
stranger
at
once
and
educated
would
interpret
the
mystery
that
had
been
burning
in
her
bosom
for
more
than
a
fortnight
her
blue
eyes
were
fixed
on
me
with
an
air
of
ineffable
satisfaction
as
i
laboriously
read
the
sloping
lines
which
conveyed
this
message
mademoiselle
this
is
to
tell
you
that
my
intentions
have
not
changed
since
the
day
we
spoke
on
the
after
vespers
and
that
i
am
anxious
about
yours
my
heart
is
all
yours
mademoiselle
and
i
wish
yours
to
be
all
mine
and
if
it
is
you
may
be
sure
and
certain
that
no
one
alive
is
happier
on
earth
or
in
heaven
than
your
does
not
put
his
name
here
but
you
know
quite
well
who
he
is
mademoiselle
and
do
you
know
mlle
christine
i
said
returning
the
letter
very
likely
i
do
she
said
with
a
smile
that
showed
her
white
teeth
while
she
gravely
nodded
her
young
face
radiant
with
happiness
thank
you
ladies
and
gentleman
she
jumped
off
the
step
and
soon
disappeared
among
the
bushes
chanting
as
she
went
the
deep
and
joyful
notes
of
some
bretonne
ballad
mme
laroque
had
followed
with
evident
rapture
all
the
details
of
this
pastoral
scene
which
harmonized
deliciously
with
her
favourite
fancies
she
smiled
and
dreamed
at
the
vision
of
this
happy
barefooted
girl
as
if
she
were
under
a
spell
however
when
mlle
ogadec
was
out
of
sight
a
strange
notion
came
into
mme
laroque
s
head
after
all
she
thought
it
would
not
have
been
a
bad
thing
to
have
given
the
girl
a
addition
to
her
admiration
call
her
back
alain
she
cried
but
mother
why
said
mlle
marguerite
quickly
though
so
far
she
had
apparently
taken
no
notice
of
the
incident
my
dear
child
perhaps
this
girl
does
not
thoroughly
understand
how
much
i
should
enjoy
and
how
much
she
ought
to
enjoy
running
about
barefooted
in
the
dust
it
would
be
nice
at
any
rate
to
leave
her
some
little
souvenir
money
replied
mlle
marguerite
oh
mother
don
t
don
t
soil
her
happiness
with
money
this
delicate
by
the
way
poor
christine
might
not
have
astonishing
enough
in
the
mouth
of
mlle
marguerite
who
did
not
as
a
rule
pride
herself
on
such
subtlety
indeed
i
thought
she
was
joking
though
she
showed
no
signs
of
amusement
however
that
may
be
her
mother
took
the
caprice
very
seriously
it
was
decided
enthusiastically
to
leave
this
idyll
to
innocence
and
bare
feet
after
this
pretty
episode
mme
laroque
relapsed
into
her
smiling
ecstasy
and
mlle
marguerite
fanned
herself
more
seriously
than
ever
an
hour
later
we
reached
our
destination
like
most
of
the
farms
in
this
country
where
the
uplands
and
plateaux
are
the
sterile
the
farm
of
langoat
lies
in
the
hollow
of
a
valley
with
a
running
through
it
the
farmer
s
wife
was
better
and
at
once
set
to
work
preparing
dinner
the
chief
elements
of
which
we
had
been
careful
to
bring
with
us
it
was
served
on
the
natural
lawn
of
a
meadow
under
the
shade
of
an
enormous
chestnut
mme
laroque
though
sitting
in
a
most
uncomfortable
attitude
on
one
of
the
cushions
from
the
carriage
seemed
perfectly
radiant
she
said
our
party
reminded
her
of
the
groups
of
reapers
we
see
crowding
under
the
shade
of
a
hedge
whose
rustic
feasts
she
had
always
envied
as
for
me
i
might
perhaps
at
another
time
have
found
a
singular
sweetness
in
the
close
and
easy
intimacy
which
an
outdoor
meal
of
this
kind
usually
creates
among
the
guests
but
with
a
painful
feeling
of
constraint
i
thrust
away
an
enjoyment
that
might
inflict
regret
and
the
bread
of
this
transient
fraternity
was
bitter
in
my
mouth
have
you
ever
been
up
there
said
mme
laroque
to
me
as
we
finished
dinner
she
indicated
the
top
of
a
lofty
hill
which
commanded
the
meadow
we
were
in
no
madame
oh
but
you
should
go
you
get
such
a
lovely
view
you
must
see
it
marguerite
will
take
you
while
they
re
putting
the
horses
in
won
t
you
i
mother
i
have
only
been
there
once
and
it
was
a
long
time
ago
however
i
daresay
i
can
find
the
way
come
odiot
and
be
prepared
for
a
stiff
climb
mlle
marguerite
and
i
started
at
once
to
climb
a
very
steep
path
which
wound
along
the
side
of
the
mountain
passing
in
some
places
through
clumps
of
trees
the
girl
stopped
from
time
to
time
in
her
swift
and
easy
ascent
to
see
if
i
were
following
her
and
panting
a
little
smiled
at
me
without
speaking
on
reaching
the
bare
heath
which
formed
the
plateau
i
saw
a
short
way
off
a
village
church
the
lines
of
its
little
steeple
sharply
defined
against
the
sky
that
s
where
it
is
said
my
young
guide
quickening
her
pace
beyond
the
church
was
a
cemetery
shut
in
by
walls
she
opened
the
gate
and
made
her
way
with
difficulty
through
the
tall
grass
and
trailing
brambles
which
choked
the
place
of
rest
towards
a
kind
of
semicircular
which
stood
at
the
farther
end
two
or
three
rough
steps
defaced
by
time
and
rather
strangely
ornamented
with
massive
balls
led
to
a
narrow
platform
raised
to
the
level
of
the
wall
a
granite
cross
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
semicircle
mlle
marguerite
had
scarcely
reached
the
platform
and
looked
into
the
space
that
opened
before
her
when
i
saw
her
place
her
hand
before
her
eyes
as
if
she
were
suddenly
dazzled
i
hastened
to
join
her
the
beautiful
day
nearing
to
its
end
lighted
with
its
last
splendours
a
scene
so
vast
so
strange
and
so
sublime
that
i
shall
never
forget
it
illustration
i
fell
on
my
knees
i
could
not
keep
back
my
tears
see
page
facing
us
and
at
a
great
depth
below
the
platform
extended
farther
than
we
could
see
a
sort
of
marsh
studded
with
shining
patches
and
looking
like
a
region
slowly
emerging
from
a
deluge
this
great
bay
stretched
from
under
our
feet
to
the
heart
of
the
jagged
mountains
on
the
banks
of
mud
and
sand
which
separated
the
shifting
lagoons
a
growth
of
reeds
and
sea
plants
tinged
with
a
thousand
shades
sombre
but
distinct
contrasted
sharply
with
the
gleaming
surfaces
of
the
waters
at
each
of
its
rapid
strides
to
the
horizon
the
sun
lit
up
or
darkened
some
of
the
many
lakes
which
checkered
the
gulf
he
seemed
to
take
in
turn
from
his
celestial
casket
the
most
precious
and
gold
ruby
and
make
them
flash
on
each
point
of
this
gorgeous
plain
as
the
planet
neared
the
end
of
his
career
a
strip
of
undulating
mist
at
the
farther
limit
of
the
marshes
reddened
all
at
once
with
the
glare
of
a
conflagration
and
for
a
moment
kept
the
radiant
transparency
of
a
cloud
furrowed
by
lightning
i
was
absorbed
in
the
contemplation
of
a
picture
so
full
of
divine
grandeur
and
enriched
as
with
another
ray
of
glory
by
the
great
memory
of
cæsar
when
a
low
voice
murmured
oh
how
beautiful
it
is
i
had
not
expected
this
sympathetic
outburst
from
my
companion
i
turned
eagerly
towards
her
with
a
surprise
that
was
not
lessened
when
the
emotion
in
her
face
and
the
slight
trembling
of
her
lips
had
convinced
me
of
the
profound
sincerity
of
her
admiration
you
admit
that
it
is
beautiful
i
said
to
her
she
shook
her
head
but
at
the
same
moment
two
tears
fell
slowly
from
her
great
eyes
she
felt
them
rolling
down
her
cheeks
made
a
gesture
of
annoyance
and
then
throwing
herself
suddenly
on
the
granite
cross
on
the
base
of
which
she
was
standing
she
embraced
it
with
both
hands
pressed
her
head
close
against
the
stone
and
sobbed
convulsively
i
did
not
think
it
right
to
say
a
word
that
might
trouble
the
course
of
this
sudden
emotion
and
i
turned
reverently
away
after
a
moment
seeing
her
raise
her
forehead
and
hastily
replace
her
loosened
hair
i
came
nearer
i
am
ashamed
of
myself
she
murmured
you
have
more
reason
to
rejoice
believe
me
you
must
give
up
trying
to
destroy
the
source
of
those
tears
it
is
holy
besides
you
will
never
succeed
i
must
said
the
girl
desperately
see
it
is
done
this
weakness
took
me
by
surprise
i
want
to
hate
everything
that
is
good
and
beautiful
in
god
s
name
why
because
i
am
beautiful
and
i
can
never
be
loved
then
as
a
torrent
bursts
its
barriers
at
last
she
continued
with
extraordinary
energy
it
is
true
she
put
her
hand
on
her
heaving
bosom
god
had
put
into
this
heart
all
the
qualities
that
i
ridicule
that
i
blaspheme
every
hour
of
the
day
but
when
he
condemned
me
to
be
rich
he
withdrew
with
one
hand
all
that
he
had
lavished
with
the
other
what
is
the
good
of
my
beauty
what
is
the
good
of
the
devotion
tenderness
and
enthusiasm
which
i
feel
burning
within
me
these
are
not
the
charms
which
make
so
many
cowards
weary
me
with
their
homage
i
see
it
i
know
know
it
too
well
and
if
ever
some
disinterested
generous
and
heroic
soul
loved
me
for
what
i
am
and
not
for
what
i
have
i
should
never
know
never
believe
it
eternal
mistrust
that
is
my
is
my
torture
so
i
have
decided
i
will
never
love
i
will
never
pour
into
some
vile
worthless
and
venal
heart
the
pure
passion
which
is
burning
in
mine
my
soul
will
die
virgin
in
my
bosom
well
i
am
resigned
that
is
beautiful
everything
that
sets
me
dreaming
everything
that
speaks
to
me
of
realms
forbidden
everything
that
stirs
these
vain
fires
in
thrust
it
away
i
hate
it
i
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
she
stopped
trembling
then
in
a
lower
tone
she
said
monsieur
i
did
not
seek
this
opportunity
i
have
not
chosen
my
words
i
did
not
mean
to
tell
you
but
i
have
spoken
you
know
all
and
if
at
any
time
i
have
wounded
your
feelings
i
think
you
will
forgive
me
now
she
held
out
her
hand
when
my
lips
touched
that
soft
hand
still
wet
with
tears
a
mortal
languor
stole
through
my
veins
marguerite
turned
her
head
away
looked
into
the
sombre
sky
and
then
slowly
descended
the
steps
let
us
go
she
said
another
road
longer
but
easier
than
the
steep
ascent
of
the
mountain
brought
us
into
the
farmyard
neither
of
us
spoke
a
single
word
the
whole
way
what
could
i
have
said
i
who
was
more
to
be
suspected
than
any
other
i
felt
that
every
word
from
my
overcharged
heart
would
separate
me
still
further
from
this
stormy
but
adorable
soul
night
had
fallen
and
hid
from
every
one
the
signs
of
our
common
emotion
we
drove
away
after
telling
us
again
how
much
she
had
enjoyed
her
day
mme
laroque
gave
herself
up
to
dreaming
about
it
mlle
marguerite
invisible
and
motionless
in
the
deep
shadow
seemed
also
to
be
sleeping
but
when
a
bend
in
the
road
caused
a
ray
of
pale
light
to
fall
upon
her
the
fixed
and
open
eyes
showed
that
she
was
wakeful
and
silent
beset
by
the
thought
that
caused
her
despair
i
can
scarcely
say
what
i
felt
a
strange
sensation
of
deep
joy
and
deep
bitterness
possessed
me
entirely
i
yielded
to
it
as
one
sometimes
yields
consciously
to
a
dream
the
charm
of
which
we
are
not
strong
enough
to
resist
we
reached
home
about
midnight
i
got
down
at
the
beginning
of
the
avenue
and
took
the
short
way
through
the
park
to
my
quarters
entering
a
dim
alley
i
heard
a
faint
sound
of
voices
and
approaching
footsteps
and
saw
vaguely
in
the
darkness
two
shadowy
figures
it
was
late
enough
to
justify
me
in
stepping
into
a
clump
of
trees
to
watch
these
nocturnal
wanderers
they
passed
slowly
in
front
of
me
i
recognised
mlle
hélouin
she
was
leaning
on
de
bévallan
s
arm
at
this
moment
the
sound
of
the
carriage
alarmed
them
they
shook
hands
and
separated
hurriedly
mlle
hélouin
going
towards
the
château
the
other
to
the
woods
in
my
own
room
fresh
from
my
adventure
i
asked
myself
indignantly
whether
i
was
to
allow
de
bévallan
to
carry
on
his
double
love
affair
uninterrupted
and
to
let
him
find
a
and
a
mistress
in
the
same
house
i
am
too
much
a
man
of
my
age
and
time
to
feel
the
puritan
s
horror
of
certain
weaknesses
and
i
am
not
hypocrite
enough
to
affect
what
i
do
not
feel
but
i
believe
that
the
morality
which
is
easiest
and
most
indulgent
in
this
respect
still
demands
some
degree
of
dignity
and
delicacy
even
in
these
devious
ways
a
man
must
walk
straight
to
some
extent
the
real
excuse
of
love
is
that
it
love
but
de
bévallan
s
catholic
tendernesses
exclude
all
possibility
of
passion
such
are
not
even
sins
they
are
something
altogether
lower
in
the
moral
scale
they
are
but
the
calculations
and
the
wagers
of
brutalized
the
various
incidents
of
this
evening
combined
to
convince
me
that
this
man
was
utterly
unworthy
of
the
hand
and
heart
he
dared
to
covet
such
a
union
would
be
monstrous
but
i
saw
at
once
that
i
should
not
be
able
to
prevent
it
by
using
the
weapons
that
chance
had
put
into
my
hands
the
best
of
objects
does
not
justify
base
methods
and
nothing
can
excuse
the
informer
this
marriage
will
take
place
and
heaven
will
permit
one
of
its
noblest
creatures
to
fall
into
the
arms
of
a
libertine
it
will
permit
that
profanation
alas
it
allows
so
many
others
i
tried
to
imagine
how
this
young
girl
could
have
chosen
this
man
by
what
process
of
false
reasoning
she
had
come
to
prefer
him
to
all
others
i
think
i
have
guessed
de
bévallan
is
very
rich
he
brings
a
fortune
nearly
equal
to
the
one
he
acquires
that
is
a
kind
of
guarantee
he
could
do
without
this
additional
wealth
he
is
assumed
to
be
more
disinterested
than
others
because
he
is
better
off
how
foolish
an
argument
what
a
terrible
mistake
to
estimate
people
s
venality
by
the
amount
of
their
wealth
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
opulence
increases
greed
the
most
are
not
the
poorest
was
there
then
no
hope
that
marguerite
would
see
the
worthlessness
of
her
choice
no
hope
that
her
own
heart
would
give
her
the
counsel
i
could
not
suggest
might
not
a
new
feeling
arise
in
her
heart
and
breathing
on
the
vain
resolutions
of
reason
destroy
them
was
not
this
feeling
already
born
indeed
and
had
i
not
received
irrefutable
proofs
of
it
the
strange
caprices
the
humiliations
struggles
and
tears
of
which
i
had
been
so
long
the
object
or
the
witness
proclaimed
beyond
doubt
a
reason
that
wavered
not
mistress
of
itself
i
had
seen
enough
of
life
to
know
that
a
scene
like
that
of
which
chance
had
this
evening
made
me
the
confidant
and
almost
the
accomplice
does
not
however
spontaneous
it
may
seem
occur
in
an
atmosphere
of
indifference
such
emotions
such
shocks
prove
that
there
are
two
souls
already
shaken
by
the
same
storm
or
about
to
be
so
shaken
but
if
it
were
true
if
she
loved
me
as
too
certainly
i
loved
her
i
might
say
of
that
love
what
she
had
said
of
her
beauty
what
is
the
good
of
it
for
i
could
never
hope
that
it
would
be
strong
enough
to
triumph
over
the
eternal
mistrust
which
is
at
once
the
defect
and
quality
of
that
noble
girl
my
character
i
dare
say
it
resents
the
outrage
of
this
mistrust
but
my
situation
more
than
that
of
any
other
is
calculated
to
rouse
it
what
miracle
is
to
bridge
the
abyss
between
these
suspicions
and
the
reserve
they
force
upon
me
finally
granting
the
miracle
if
she
offered
me
the
hand
for
which
i
would
give
my
life
but
for
which
i
will
never
ask
would
our
union
be
happy
should
i
not
have
to
fear
early
or
late
in
this
restless
imagination
the
slow
awakening
of
a
mistrust
could
i
in
the
midst
of
wealth
not
mine
guard
myself
against
misgivings
could
i
really
be
happy
in
a
love
that
is
sullied
by
being
a
benefit
as
well
our
part
as
the
protector
of
women
is
so
strictly
laid
upon
us
by
all
sentiments
of
honour
that
it
can
not
even
from
the
highest
motives
be
reversed
for
an
instant
without
casting
upon
us
some
shadow
of
doubt
and
suspicion
truly
wealth
is
not
so
great
an
advantage
that
we
can
not
find
some
counterpoise
to
it
i
imagine
that
a
man
who
brings
his
wife
in
exchange
for
some
bags
of
gold
a
name
that
he
has
made
illustrious
acknowledged
worth
a
great
position
or
the
promise
of
a
great
future
does
not
feel
that
he
is
under
a
crushing
obligation
but
my
hands
are
empty
my
future
is
no
better
than
my
present
of
all
the
advantages
which
the
world
worships
i
have
only
i
am
determined
not
to
bear
it
that
it
may
not
be
said
it
was
the
price
of
a
bargain
i
should
receive
all
and
give
nothing
a
king
may
marry
a
shepherdess
that
is
generous
and
charming
and
we
congratulate
him
with
good
reason
but
a
shepherd
who
lets
a
queen
marry
him
does
not
cut
so
fine
a
figure
i
have
spent
the
night
thinking
these
things
over
and
seeking
a
solution
that
i
have
not
yet
found
perhaps
i
ought
to
leave
this
house
and
this
place
at
once
prudence
counsels
it
this
business
can
not
end
well
how
often
one
minute
of
courage
and
firmness
would
spare
us
a
lifetime
of
regret
i
ought
at
least
to
be
overwhelmed
by
sadness
i
have
never
had
such
good
reason
for
melancholy
but
i
can
not
grieve
my
brain
distracted
and
tortured
yet
holds
a
thought
which
dominates
everything
and
fills
me
with
more
than
mortal
joy
my
soul
is
as
light
as
a
bird
of
the
air
i
shall
always
little
cemetery
that
distant
ocean
that
vast
horizon
and
on
that
glowing
hilltop
that
angel
of
beauty
bathed
in
divine
tears
still
i
feel
her
hand
under
my
lips
her
tears
in
my
eyes
and
in
my
heart
i
love
her
well
if
so
it
must
be
i
will
decide
till
then
for
god
s
sake
let
me
have
a
little
rest
i
have
not
been
overdone
with
happiness
i
may
die
of
this
love
but
i
will
live
in
peace
with
it
for
one
day
at
least
that
day
the
single
day
i
asked
has
not
been
granted
me
my
brief
weakness
has
not
had
long
to
wait
for
its
punishment
which
will
be
lasting
how
could
i
have
forgotten
moral
laws
can
no
more
be
broken
with
impunity
than
physical
and
their
invariable
action
constitutes
the
permanent
intervention
of
what
we
call
providence
in
the
affairs
of
this
world
a
great
though
weak
man
writing
the
gospel
of
a
sage
with
the
hand
of
a
said
of
the
passions
that
were
at
once
his
misery
his
reproach
and
his
glory
all
are
good
while
we
are
their
masters
all
are
bad
when
we
let
them
enslave
us
nature
forbids
us
to
let
our
attachments
exceed
our
strength
reason
forbids
us
to
desire
what
we
can
not
obtain
conscience
does
not
forbid
us
to
be
tempted
it
does
forbid
us
to
yield
to
temptation
it
does
not
rest
with
us
to
have
or
not
to
have
passions
but
it
does
rest
with
us
to
control
them
all
the
feelings
which
we
govern
are
legitimate
all
those
that
govern
us
are
criminal
attach
your
heart
only
to
the
beauty
that
does
not
perish
limit
your
desires
by
your
conditions
put
your
duties

may

you

up
everything
at
the
command
of
virtue
yes
such
is
the
law
i
knew
it
i
have
broken
it
i
am
punished
it
is
right
i
had
scarcely
set
foot
on
my
cloud
of
folly
when
i
was
thrown
violently
off
and
now
after
five
days
i
have
barely
courage
to
recount
the
almost
ridiculous
details
of
my
downfall
mme
laroque
and
her
daughter
had
gone
in
the
morning
to
pay
another
visit
to
mme
de
and
to
bring
back
mme
aubry
i
found
mlle
hélouin
alone
at
the
château
i
had
brought
her
quarter
s
salary
for
though
my
duties
do
not
in
a
general
way
trench
on
the
maintenance
and
internal
discipline
of
the
house
the
ladies
had
wished
no
doubt
from
consideration
for
mlle
hélouin
and
for
me
that
i
should
pay
both
our
salaries
the
young
lady
was
sitting
in
the
small
boudoir
near
the
she
received
me
with
a
pensive
sweetness
which
touched
me
for
at
that
moment
i
felt
in
myself
that
fulness
of
heart
which
inclines
us
to
confidence
and
kindness
i
quixotically
resolved
to
hold
out
a
helping
hand
to
this
poor
lonely
creature
mademoiselle
i
said
abruptly
you
have
withdrawn
your
friendship
from
me
but
my
friendship
for
you
remains
unaltered
may
i
give
you
a
proof
of
it
she
looked
at
me
and
murmured
a
timid
assent
well
my
poor
child
you
are
bent
on
your
own
ruin
she
rose
quickly
you
saw
me
in
the
park
that
night
she
cried
i
did
my
god
she
came
towards
me
maxime
i
swear
to
you
that
i
am
a
virtuous
girl
i
believe
it
mademoiselle
but
i
must
warn
you
that
in
this
little
romance
perfectly
innocent
no
doubt
on
your
side
whatever
it
may
be
on
the
other
you
are
imperilling
your
reputation
and
your
peace
of
mind
i
beg
you
to
reflect
seriously
on
this
matter
and
at
the
same
time
i
beg
to
assure
you
that
no
one
but
you
will
ever
hear
a
word
on
this
subject
from
me
i
was
leaving
the
room
when
she
sank
on
her
knees
before
a
couch
and
burst
out
sobbing
leaning
her
forehead
against
my
hand
which
she
had
seized
it
was
not
long
since
i
had
seen
sweeter
and
nobler
tears
but
still
i
was
touched
come
my
dear
young
lady
i
said
it
is
not
too
late
is
it
she
shook
her
head
decisively
very
well
my
child
be
brave
and
we
will
save
you
what
can
i
do
to
help
me
has
this
man
any
proof
any
letter
i
can
demand
from
him
on
your
behalf
command
me
as
if
i
were
your
brother
she
released
my
hand
angrily
how
hard
you
are
she
said
you
talk
of
saving
me
it
is
you
who
are
ruining
me
after
pretending
to
love
me
you
repulsed
me
you
have
humiliated
me
and
made
me
desperate
you
are
the
sole
cause
of
what
has
happened
mademoiselle
you
are
unjust
i
never
pretended
to
love
you
i
had
a
sincere
affection
for
you
and
i
have
it
still
i
admit
that
your
beauty
your
wit
and
your
talents
fully
entitle
you
to
look
for
more
than
fraternal
friendship
from
those
who
see
you
every
day
but
my
situation
and
my
duties
to
my
family
preclude
my
indulging
any
other
feeling
for
you
without
being
dishonourable
i
tell
you
frankly
that
i
think
you
are
charming
and
i
assure
you
that
in
restricting
my
sentiments
towards
you
within
the
limits
imposed
by
loyalty
i
have
not
been
without
merit
i
see
nothing
humiliating
for
you
in
that
what
might
indeed
humiliate
you
mademoiselle
would
be
the
determined
pursuit
of
a
man
determined
not
to
marry
you
she
gave
me
an
evil
look
what
do
you
know
about
it
she
said
every
man
is
not
a
oh
mademoiselle
are
you
a
spiteful
little
person
i
said
very
calmly
if
so
i
will
wish
you
m
maxime
she
cried
rushing
forward
to
stop
me
forgive
me
have
pity
on
me
alas
i
am
so
unhappy
imagine
what
must
be
the
thoughts
of
a
poor
creature
like
me
who
has
been
heart
a
soul
a
brain
and
who
can
only
use
them
to
suffer
and
to
hate
what
is
my
life
what
is
my
future
my
life
is
the
perception
of
my
poverty
ceaselessly
aggravated
by
the
luxury
which
surrounds
me
my
future
will
be
to
regret
some
day
to
weep
bitterly
for
even
this
slave
s
life
odious
as
it
is
you
talk
of
my
youth
my
wit
and
my
talents
would
that
i
had
never
had
the
capacity
for
anything
higher
than
breaking
stones
on
the
road
i
should
have
been
happier
my
talents
i
shall
have
passed
the
best
part
of
my
life
in
decking
another
woman
with
them
and
giving
her
thereby
additional
beauty
insolence
and
when
my
best
blood
has
passed
into
this
doll
s
veins
she
will
go
off
on
the
arm
of
a
happy
husband
to
take
her
part
in
the
best
pleasures
of
life
while
old
solitary
and
deserted
i
shall
go
to
die
in
some
hole
with
the
pension
of
a
lady
s
maid
what
have
i
done
to
deserve
this
fate
tell
me
that
why
should
it
be
mine
rather
than
that
of
those
other
women
because
i
am
not
as
good
as
they
are
if
i
am
bad
it
is
because
suffering
has
envenomed
me
because
injustice
has
blackened
my
soul
i
was
born
with
a
disposition
as
great
as
be
good
and
loving
and
charitable
my
god
benefits
cost
little
when
you
re
rich
and
kindness
is
easy
when
you
re
happy
if
i
were
in
their
place
and
they
in
mine
they
would
hate
me
as
i
hate
them
we
do
not
love
our
masters
ah
this
is
i
am
saying
to
you
i
know
it
and
this
is
the
crowning
feel
my
own
degradation
i
blush
for
it
and
increase
it
alas
now
you
despise
me
more
than
ever
you
whom
i
could
have
loved
so
much
if
you
would
have
let
me
you
who
could
have
given
me
all
that
i
have
lost
hope
peace
goodness
ah
there
was
a
moment
when
i
believed
that
i
was
saved
when
for
the
first
time
i
dreamed
of
happiness
of
hope
of
pride
poor
wretch
she
had
seized
both
my
hands
her
head
fell
on
them
and
she
wept
wildly
under
her
long
flowing
curls
my
dear
child
i
said
to
her
i
know
better
than
any
one
the
trials
and
humiliations
of
your
position
but
let
me
tell
you
that
you
increase
them
greatly
by
nourishing
the
sentiments
you
have
just
expressed
they
are
hideous
and
you
will
end
by
deserving
all
the
hardships
of
your
lot
but
after
all
your
imagination
strangely
exaggerates
those
hardships
as
for
the
present
whatever
you
may
say
you
are
treated
like
a
friend
here
as
to
the
future
i
see
nothing
to
prevent
you
from
leaving
this
house
on
the
arm
of
a
happy
husband
too
for
my
part
i
shall
be
grateful
for
your
affection
throughout
my
life
will
tell
you
once
more
and
finish
with
the
subject
have
duties
that
bind
me
and
i
do
not
wish
nor
am
i
able
to
marry
she
looked
at
me
suddenly
not
even
marguerite
she
said
i
do
not
see
that
it
is
necessary
to
introduce
mlle
marguerite
s
name
with
one
hand
she
threw
back
the
hair
which
fell
over
her
face
and
the
other
she
held
out
at
me
with
a
menacing
gesture
you
love
her
she
said
in
a
hoarse
voice
no
you
love
her
money
but
you
shall
not
have
it
mademoiselle
hélouin
ah
she
continued
you
must
be
a
child
indeed
if
you
think
you
can
deceive
a
woman
who
was
fool
enough
to
love
you
i
see
through
your
manoeuvres
besides
i
know
who
you
are
i
was
not
far
off
when
mlle
de
porhoët
conveyed
your
confidence
to
mme
so
you
listen
at
doors
mademoiselle
i
care
nothing
for
your
insults
besides
i
shall
avenge
myself
and
soon
too
oh
there
s
no
doubt
you
re
very
clever
de
chamcey
i
congratulate
you
wonderfully
well
have
you
played
your
little
part
of
disinterestedness
and
reserve
as
your
friend
laubépin
advised
you
to
do
when
he
sent
you
here
he
knew
the
person
you
would
have
to
deal
with
he
knew
well
enough
this
girl
s
absurd
mania
and
you
think
you
ve
already
got
your
prey
don
t
you
adorable
millions
aren
t
they
there
are
queer
stories
about
their
origin
but
at
any
rate
they
will
serve
very
well
to
furbish
up
your
marquisate
and
regild
your
escutcheon
well
from
this
moment
you
can
give
up
that
idea
for
i
swear
you
shall
not
keep
your
mask
a
day
longer
and
this
hand
shall
tear
it
from
you
mlle
hélouin
it
is
quite
time
we
brought
this
scene
to
an
end
we
are
verging
on
melodrama
you
have
given
me
an
opportunity
of
forestalling
you
in
and
calumniation
but
you
are
perfectly
safe
i
give
you
my
word
of
honour
that
i
shall
not
use
those
weapons
and
mademoiselle
i
am
your
humble
servant
i
left
the
unhappy
girl
with
a
feeling
of
mingled
disgust
and
pity
i
have
always
thought
that
the
highest
organization
must
from
its
very
nature
be
galled
and
warped
in
a
situation
as
equivocal
and
humiliating
as
that
which
mlle
hélouin
occupies
here
but
i
was
not
prepared
for
the
abyss
of
venom
that
had
just
opened
under
my
eyes
most
one
thinks
the
matter
can
scarcely
conceive
a
situation
which
subjects
a
human
soul
to
more
hateful
temptations
or
is
better
calculated
to
develop
and
sharpen
envy
to
arouse
the
protests
of
pride
and
to
exasperate
feminine
vanity
and
jealousy
most
of
the
unhappy
girls
who
are
driven
to
this
occupation
only
escape
the
troubles
mlle
hélouin
had
not
been
able
to
guard
herself
against
either
by
the
moderation
of
their
feeling
or
by
the
grace
of
god
through
the
firmness
of
their
principles
sometimes
i
had
thought
that
our
misfortunes
might
make
it
necessary
for
my
sister
to
go
as
governess
into
some
rich
family
i
swore
then
that
whatever
future
might
be
reserved
for
us
i
would
rather
share
the
hardest
life
in
the
poorest
garret
with
hélène
than
let
her
sit
at
the
poisoned
banquets
of
an
opulent
and
hateful
servitude
though
i
had
firmly
resolved
to
leave
the
field
free
to
mlle
hélouin
and
on
no
account
to
engage
personally
in
the
recriminations
of
a
degrading
contest
i
could
not
regard
without
misgiving
the
probable
consequences
of
the
treacherous
war
just
declared
against
me
evidently
i
was
threatened
where
i
was
most
my
love
and
in
my
honour
mistress
of
the
secret
of
my
heart
mingling
truth
and
falsehood
with
the
skilful
perfidy
of
her
sex
mlle
hélouin
might
easily
show
my
conduct
in
an
unfavourable
light
turn
all
the
precautions
and
scruples
of
my
delicacy
against
me
and
give
my
simplest
actions
the
appearance
of
deliberate
intrigue
i
could
not
foresee
the
form
her
malevolence
would
take
but
i
could
depend
upon
her
to
choose
the
most
effectual
methods
better
than
any
one
she
knew
the
weak
places
in
the
imaginations
she
wished
to
impress
over
mlle
marguerite
and
her
mother
she
had
the
advantage
which
dissimulation
usually
has
over
frankness
and
cunning
over
simplicity
they
trusted
her
with
the
trust
that
is
born
of
long
use
and
daily
association
her
masters
as
she
called
them
were
not
likely
to
suspect
that
under
the
pretty
brightness
and
obsequious
consideration
which
she
assumed
with
such
consummate
art
she
concealed
a
frenzy
of
pride
and
ingratitude
which
was
eating
her
miserable
heart
away
it
was
too
probable
that
a
hand
so
sure
and
skilful
would
pour
its
poison
with
complete
success
into
hearts
thus
prepared
it
was
true
mlle
hélouin
might
be
afraid
that
by
yielding
to
her
resentment
she
would
thrust
mlle
marguerite
s
hand
into
that
of
de
bévallan
and
hasten
a
marriage
which
would
be
the
ruin
of
her
own
ambition
but
i
knew
that
the
woman
who
hates
does
not
calculate
and
risks
everything
so
i
awaited
from
her
the
swiftest
and
blindest
of
vengeance
and
i
was
right
in
painful
anxiety
i
passed
the
hours
that
should
have
been
given
to
sweeter
thoughts
all
that
a
proud
spirit
finds
most
galling
in
dependence
the
suspicion
hardest
for
a
loyal
conscience
the
scorn
most
bitter
to
a
loving
heart
i
endured
in
anticipation
never
in
my
worst
hours
had
adversity
offered
me
a
cup
so
full
however
i
tried
to
work
as
usual
about
five
o
clock
i
went
to
the
château
the
ladies
had
returned
during
the
afternoon
in
the
i
found
mlle
marguerite
mme
aubry
de
bévallan
and
two
or
three
casual
guests
mlle
marguerite
did
not
appear
to
be
aware
of
my
presence
but
continued
to
talk
to
de
bévallan
in
a
more
animated
style
than
usual
they
were
discussing
an
impromptu
dance
which
was
to
take
place
the
same
evening
at
a
neighbouring
château
she
was
going
with
her
mother
and
urged
de
bévallan
to
accompany
them
he
excused
himself
on
the
ground
that
he
had
left
his
house
that
morning
before
receiving
the
invitation
and
that
his
costume
was
inadmissible
with
an
eager
and
affectionate
coquetry
which
evidently
surprised
even
him
mlle
marguerite
persisted
saying
that
there
was
still
time
to
go
back
and
dress
and
return
to
fetch
them
she
promised
that
a
nice
little
dinner
should
be
kept
for
him
de
bévallan
said
that
his
carriage
horses
were
not
available
and
that
he
could
not
ride
back
in
evening
dress
very
well
replied
mlle
marguerite
they
shall
drive
you
over
in
the
at
the
same
moment
she
turned
towards
me
for
the
first
time
with
a
look
in
which
i
saw
the
thunderbolt
that
was
about
to
fall
odiot
she
said
in
a
sharp
imperious
tone
go
and
tell
them
to
put
the
horse
in
this
imperious
order
was
so
little
in
harmony
with
such
as
i
was
accustomed
to
receive
here
or
such
as
i
could
be
expected
to
tolerate
that
the
attention
and
curiosity
of
the
most
indifferent
were
excited
there
was
an
awkward
silence
de
bévallan
glanced
in
surprise
at
mlle
marguerite
then
he
looked
at
me
and
got
up
with
a
very
serious
air
if
they
thought
i
should
give
way
to
some
mad
prompting
of
anger
they
were
mistaken
it
was
true
that
the
insulting
words
which
had
just
fallen
on
me
from
a
mouth
so
beautiful
so
beloved
and
so
cruel
had
struck
the
icy
coldness
of
death
to
the
very
depths
of
my
being
a
blade
of
steel
piercing
my
heart
could
hardly
have
caused
me
keener
pain
but
never
had
i
been
calmer
the
bell
which
mme
laroque
uses
to
summon
her
servants
stood
on
a
table
within
my
reach
i
touched
it
with
my
finger
a
entered
almost
directly
i
think
i
said
to
him
mlle
marguerite
has
some
orders
to
give
you
at
this
speech
which
she
had
heard
in
amazement
marguerite
shook
her
head
quickly
and
dismissed
the
man
i
longed
to
get
out
of
this
room
where
i
seemed
to
be
choking
but
in
view
of
de
bévallan
s
provoking
manner
i
could
not
withdraw
upon
my
word
he
murmured
there
s
something
very
strange
about
all
this
i
took
no
notice
of
him
mlle
marguerite
said
something
to
him
under
her
breath
i
obey
mademoiselle
he
said
in
a
louder
tone
but
you
will
allow
me
to
express
my
sincere
regret
that
i
have
not
the
right
to
interpose
here
i
rose
immediately
de
bévallan
i
said
standing
within
a
pace
or
two
of
him
that
regret
is
quite
superfluous
for
though
i
have
not
thought
fit
to
obey
mlle
laroque
s
orders
i
am
entirely
at
yours
and
i
shall
expect
to
receive
them
very
good
very
good
sir
nothing
could
be
better
replied
de
bévallan
waving
his
hand
airily
to
reassure
the
ladies
we
bowed
to
one
another
and
i
went
out
i
dined
alone
in
my
tower
poor
alain
waited
on
me
as
usual
no
doubt
he
had
heard
of
what
had
occurred
for
he
kept
looking
at
me
mournfully
sighed
often
and
deeply
and
contrary
to
his
custom
preserved
a
gloomy
silence
only
breaking
it
to
reply
in
answer
to
my
question
that
the
ladies
had
decided
not
to
go
to
the
ball
after
a
hurried
meal
i
put
my
papers
in
order
and
wrote
a
few
words
to
laubépin
in
view
of
a
possible
contingency
i
recommended
hélène
to
his
care
the
thought
that
i
might
leave
her
unprotected
and
friendless
nearly
broke
my
heart
without
in
the
least
affecting
my
immovable
principles
i
may
deceive
myself
but
i
have
always
thought
that
honour
in
our
modern
life
is
paramount
in
the
hierarchy
of
duties
it
takes
the
place
of
so
many
virtues
which
have
nearly
faded
from
our
consciences
of
so
many
dormant
beliefs
it
plays
such
a
tutelary
part
in
the
present
state
of
society
that
i
would
never
consent
to
weaken
its
claims
or
lessen
its
obligations
in
its
indefinite
character
there
is
something
superior
to
law
and
morality
one
does
not
reason
about
it
one
feels
it
it
is
a
religion
if
we
have
no
longer
the
folly
of
the
cross
let
us
keep
the
folly
of
honour
moreover
no
sentiment
has
ever
taken
such
deep
root
in
the
human
soul
without
the
sanction
of
reason
it
is
better
that
a
girl
or
a
wife
should
be
alone
in
the
world
than
that
she
should
be
protected
by
a
dishonoured
brother
or
husband
each
moment
i
expected
a
letter
from
de
bévallan
i
was
getting
ready
to
go
to
the
collector
of
taxes
in
the
town
a
young
officer
who
had
been
wounded
in
the
crimea
and
ask
him
to
be
my
second
when
some
one
knocked
at
my
door
de
bévallan
himself
came
in
apart
from
a
slight
shade
of
embarrassment
his
face
expressed
nothing
but
a
frank
and
joyful
kindliness
odiot
he
said
as
i
looked
at
him
in
surprise
this
is
rather
an
unusual
step
but
thank
heaven
my
place
my
courage
beyond
suspicion
on
the
other
hand
i
have
such
good
reason
for
feeling
happy
that
i
have
no
room
for
rancour
or
enmity
lastly
i
am
obeying
orders
which
will
now
be
more
sacred
to
me
than
ever
in
short
i
come
to
offer
you
my
hand
i
bowed
gravely
and
took
his
hand
now
he
went
on
as
he
sat
down
i
can
execute
my
commission
comfortably
a
little
while
ago
mlle
marguerite
in
a
thoughtless
moment
gave
you
some
instructions
which
most
assuredly
did
not
come
within
your
province
very
properly
your
susceptibility
was
aroused
we
quite
recognise
that
and
now
the
ladies
charge
me
to
beg
that
you
will
accept
their
regrets
they
would
be
in
despair
if
the
misconception
of
a
moment
could
deprive
them
of
your
good
offices
which
they
value
extremely
and
put
an
end
to
relations
which
they
esteem
most
highly
speaking
for
myself
i
have
this
evening
acquired
the
right
to
add
my
entreaties
to
those
of
the
ladies
something
i
have
long
desired
has
been
granted
me
and
i
shall
be
personally
indebted
to
you
if
you
will
prevent
the
happy
memories
of
this
day
from
being
marred
by
a
separation
which
would
be
at
once
disadvantageous
and
painful
to
the
family
into
which
i
shall
shortly
enter
de
bévallan
i
said
i
fully
recognise
and
appreciate
all
that
you
have
said
on
behalf
of
the
ladies
as
well
as
on
your
own
account
you
will
excuse
me
from
giving
a
final
answer
immediately
this
is
a
matter
which
requires
more
judicial
consideration
than
i
can
give
it
at
present
at
least
said
de
bévallan
you
will
let
me
take
back
a
hopeful
report
come
odiot
since
we
have
the
opportunity
let
us
break
through
the
barrier
of
ice
that
has
kept
us
apart
till
now
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
am
quite
willing
in
the
first
place
mme
laroque
without
revealing
a
secret
that
does
not
belong
to
her
has
given
me
to
understand
that
under
the
kind
of
mystery
with
which
you
surround
yourself
there
are
circumstances
which
reflect
the
highest
credit
on
you
and
besides
i
have
a
private
reason
for
being
grateful
to
you
i
know
that
you
have
lately
been
consulted
in
reference
to
my
intentions
towards
mlle
laroque
and
that
i
have
cause
to
congratulate
myself
on
your
opinion
my
dear
sir
i
do
not
think
i
oh
i
know
he
continued
laughing
you
didn
t
praise
me
up
to
the
skies
but
at
all
events
you
did
me
no
harm
and
i
admit
that
you
showed
real
insight
you
said
that
though
mlle
marguerite
might
not
be
absolutely
happy
with
me
she
would
not
be
unhappy
well
the
prophet
daniel
could
not
have
spoken
better
the
truth
is
the
dear
child
will
never
be
absolutely
happy
with
any
one
because
she
will
not
find
in
the
whole
world
a
husband
who
will
talk
poetry
to
her
from
morning
to
night
they
re
not
to
be
had
i
am
no
more
capable
of
it
than
any
one
else
i
own
you
were
good
enough
to
am
an
honourable
man
and
really
when
we
know
one
another
better
you
will
be
convinced
of
it
i
am
not
a
brute
i
am
a
good
fellow
god
knows
i
have
faults
one
especially
i
am
fond
of
pretty
women
i
am
i
can
t
deny
it
but
what
does
it
matter
it
shows
that
one
has
a
good
heart
besides
here
i
am
in
port
and
i
am
delighted
was
getting
into
a
bit
of
a
mess
in
short
i
mean
only
to
think
about
my
wife
and
children
in
future
so
like
you
i
believe
marguerite
will
be
perfectly
is
to
say
as
far
as
she
could
be
in
this
world
with
ideas
like
hers
for
after
all
i
shall
be
good
to
her
i
shall
refuse
her
nothing
and
i
shall
do
even
more
than
she
desires
but
if
she
asks
me
for
the
moon
and
the
stars
i
can
t
go
and
fetch
them
to
please
her
that
s
not
possible
and
now
my
dear
friend
your
hand
once
more
i
gave
it
him
he
got
up
good
i
hope
that
you
will
stay
with
us
now
come
let
me
see
that
a
brighter
face
we
will
make
your
life
as
pleasant
as
possible
but
you
ll
have
to
help
us
a
bit
you
know
you
cultivate
your
sadness
i
fancy
you
live
if
i
may
say
so
too
much
like
an
owl
you
re
a
kind
of
spaniard
such
as
one
rarely
sees
you
must
drop
that
sort
of
thing
you
are
young
and
you
have
wit
and
talents
make
the
best
of
those
qualities
listen
why
not
try
a
flirtation
with
little
hélouin
it
would
amuse
you
she
is
very
charming
and
she
would
suit
you
but
deuce
take
me
i
am
rather
forgetting
my
promotion
to
high
dignities
and
now
maxime
till
isn
t
it
till
certainly
and
this
honest
is
the
sort
of
spaniard
one
often
sees
me
to
my
reflections
a
strange
thing
has
happened
though
the
results
are
not
so
far
very
satisfactory
they
have
done
me
good
the
blow
i
had
received
had
left
me
numb
with
grief
this
at
least
makes
me
feel
that
i
am
alive
and
for
the
first
time
for
three
long
weeks
i
have
had
the
courage
to
open
this
book
and
take
up
my
pen
every
satisfaction
having
been
given
to
me
i
thought
there
was
no
longer
any
reason
for
leaving
at
least
suddenly
a
position
and
advantages
which
after
all
i
need
and
could
not
easily
replace
the
mere
prospect
of
the
personal
sufferings
i
had
to
face
which
moreover
were
the
result
of
my
own
weakness
could
not
entitle
me
to
shirk
duties
which
involved
other
interests
than
my
own
and
more
i
did
not
intend
that
mlle
marguerite
should
interpret
my
sudden
flight
as
the
result
of
pique
at
the
loss
of
a
good
match
i
made
it
a
point
of
honour
to
show
her
an
unruffled
front
up
to
the
altar
itself
as
for
my
she
could
not
see
so
i
contented
myself
with
informing
laubépin
that
certain
things
incident
to
my
situation
might
at
any
moment
become
unbearable
and
that
i
eagerly
desired
some
less
lucrative
but
more
independent
occupation
the
next
day
i
appeared
at
the
château
where
de
bévallan
received
me
cordially
i
greeted
the
ladies
with
all
the
i
could
command
there
was
of
course
no
explanation
mme
laroque
seemed
moved
and
thoughtful
mlle
marguerite
was
a
little
highly
strung
still
but
polite
as
for
mlle
hélouin
she
was
very
pale
and
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
her
work
the
poor
girl
could
not
have
been
very
much
delighted
with
the
final
result
of
her
diplomacy
she
endeavoured
once
or
twice
to
dart
a
look
of
scorn
and
menace
at
de
bévallan
but
though
this
stormy
atmosphere
might
have
troubled
a
neophyte
de
bévallan
breathed
moved
and
fluttered
about
in
it
entirely
at
his
ease
his
regal
evidently
irritated
mlle
hélouin
but
it
quelled
her
at
the
same
time
i
am
sure
however
that
she
would
have
played
him
the
same
sort
of
trick
she
had
played
me
the
day
before
and
with
far
more
excuse
if
she
had
not
been
afraid
of
ruining
herself
as
well
as
her
accomplice
but
it
was
most
likely
that
if
she
yielded
to
her
jealous
rage
and
admitted
her
ingratitude
and
duplicity
she
would
ruin
herself
only
and
she
was
quite
clever
enough
to
see
this
in
fact
de
bévallan
was
not
the
kind
of
man
to
have
run
any
risks
with
her
without
having
provided
himself
with
some
very
effective
weapon
which
he
would
use
with
pitiless
indifference
of
course
mlle
hélouin
might
tell
herself
that
the
night
before
they
had
believed
her
when
she
made
other
false
accusations
but
she
knew
that
the
falsehood
which
flatters
or
wounds
is
much
more
readily
believed
than
mere
general
truth
so
she
suffered
in
silence
not
i
suppose
without
feeling
keenly
that
the
sword
of
treachery
sometimes
turns
against
the
person
who
makes
use
of
it
during
this
day
and
those
which
followed
i
had
to
bear
a
kind
of
torture
i
had
foreseen
though
without
realizing
how
painful
it
would
be
the
marriage
was
fixed
for
a
month
later
all
the
preparations
had
to
be
made
at
once
and
in
great
haste
regularly
each
morning
came
one
of
mme
provost
s
bouquets
laces
dresses
jewels
poured
in
and
were
exhibited
every
evening
to
interested
and
envious
ladies
i
had
to
give
my
opinion
and
my
advice
on
everything
mlle
marguerite
begged
for
them
with
almost
cruel
persistence
i
responded
as
graciously
as
i
could
and
then
returned
to
my
tower
and
took
from
a
secret
drawer
the
tattered
handkerchief
i
had
won
at
the
risk
of
my
life
and
i
dried
my
tears
with
it
weakness
again
but
what
would
you
have
i
love
her
treachery
enmity
hopeless
misunderstandings
her
pride
and
mine
separate
us
forever
so
let
it
be
but
nothing
can
prevent
me
from
living
and
dying
with
my
heart
full
of
her
as
for
de
bévallan
i
did
not
hate
him
he
was
not
worthy
of
it
he
is
a
vulgar
but
harmless
soul
thank
god
i
could
receive
the
overtures
of
his
shallow
friendliness
without
hypocrisy
and
put
my
hand
tranquilly
in
his
but
if
he
was
too
insignificant
for
my
resentment
that
did
not
lessen
the
deep
and
lacerating
agony
with
which
i
recognised
his
unworthiness
of
the
rare
creature
he
would
soon
never
know
i
can
not
and
i
dare
not
describe
the
flood
of
bitter
thoughts
of
nameless
sensations
which
have
been
aroused
in
me
at
the
thought
of
this
odious
and
have
not
yet
subsided
love
real
true
love
has
something
sacred
in
it
which
gives
an
almost
superhuman
character
to
its
pain
as
to
its
joy
to
the
man
who
loves
her
a
woman
has
a
sort
of
divinity
of
which
no
other
man
knows
the
secret
which
belongs
only
to
her
lover
and
to
see
even
the
threshold
of
this
mystery
profaned
by
another
gives
us
a
strange
and
indescribable
horror
as
of
sacrilege
it
is
not
merely
that
a
precious
possession
is
taken
from
you
it
is
an
altar
polluted
a
mystery
violated
a
god
defiled
this
is
jealousy
at
least
it
is
mine
in
all
sincerity
it
seemed
to
me
that
in
the
whole
world
i
only
had
eyes
to
see
intelligence
to
understand
and
a
heart
to
worship
in
its
full
perfection
the
beauty
of
this
angel
with
any
other
she
would
be
cast
away
and
lost
body
and
soul
she
was
destined
for
me
from
all
eternity
so
vast
was
my
pride
i
expiated
it
with
suffering
as
immeasurable
nevertheless
some
mocking
demon
whispered
that
in
all
probability
marguerite
would
find
more
peace
and
real
happiness
in
the
kindly
friendship
of
a
judicious
husband
than
she
would
have
enjoyed
in
the
poetic
passion
of
a
romantic
lover
is
it
true
is
it
possible
i
do
not
believe
it
she
will
have
peace
granted
but
peace
after
all
is
not
the
best
thing
in
life
nor
the
highest
kind
of
happiness
if
insensibility
and
a
petrified
heart
sufficed
to
make
us
happy
too
many
people
who
do
not
deserve
it
would
be
happy
by
dint
of
reasoning
and
calculation
we
come
to
blaspheme
against
god
and
to
degrade
his
work
god
gives
peace
to
the
dead
to
the
living
he
gives
passion
yes
in
addition
to
the
vulgar
interests
of
daily
life
which
i
am
not
so
foolish
as
to
expect
to
set
aside
a
certain
poetry
is
permitted
nay
enjoined
that
is
the
heritage
of
the
immortal
soul
and
this
soul
must
feel
and
sometimes
reveal
itself
whether
by
visions
that
transcend
the
real
by
aspirations
that
the
possible
by
storms
or
by
tears
yes
there
is
suffering
which
is
better
than
happiness
or
rather
which
is
itself
of
a
living
creature
who
knows
all
the
agonies
of
the
heart
and
all
the
illusions
of
the
mind
and
who
accepts
these
noble
torments
with
an
equable
mind
and
a
fraternal
heart
that
is
the
romance
which
every
one
who
claims
to
be
a
man
and
to
justify
that
claim
may
and
indeed
is
bound
to
put
into
his
life
and
after
all
this
boasted
peace
will
not
be
hers
the
marriage
of
two
stolid
hearts
of
two
frozen
imaginations
may
produce
the
calm
of
lifelessness
i
can
believe
that
but
the
union
of
life
with
death
can
not
be
endured
without
a
horrible
oppression
and
ceaseless
anguish
in
the
midst
of
these
personal
miseries
which
increased
each
day
in
intensity
my
only
refuge
was
my
poor
old
friend
mlle
de
porhoët
she
did
not
know
or
pretended
not
to
know
the
state
of
my
heart
but
with
her
remote
and
perhaps
involuntary
allusions
she
touched
my
bleeding
wounds
with
a
woman
s
light
and
delicate
hand
and
this
soul
the
living
symbol
of
sacrifice
and
resignation
which
seemed
already
to
float
above
our
earth
had
a
detachment
a
calmness
and
a
gentle
firmness
which
seemed
to
descend
on
me
i
came
to
understand
her
innocent
delusion
and
to
share
it
with
something
of
the
same
simplicity
bent
over
the
album
i
wandered
with
her
for
hours
through
the
cloisters
of
her
cathedral
and
breathed
for
a
while
the
vague
perfumes
of
an
ideal
serenity
i
further
found
at
the
old
lady
s
house
another
kind
of
distraction
habit
gives
an
interest
to
every
kind
of
work
to
prevent
mlle
de
porhoët
from
suspecting
the
final
loss
of
her
case
i
regularly
continued
the
exploration
of
the
family
archives
among
the
confused
mass
i
occasionally
came
across
traditions
legends
and
traces
of
customs
which
awakened
my
curiosity
and
carried
back
my
thoughts
to
days
remote
from
the
crushing
reality
of
life
my
perseverance
maintained
mlle
de
porhoët
in
her
illusions
and
she
was
grateful
to
me
beyond
my
deserts
for
i
had
come
to
take
an
interest
in
this
practically
repaid
me
for
all
my
trouble
and
gave
me
a
wholesome
distraction
from
my
grief
as
the
fateful
day
approached
mlle
marguerite
lost
the
feverish
vivacity
which
had
seemed
to
inspire
her
since
the
date
of
the
marriage
had
been
fixed
and
relapsed
at
times
into
the
fits
of
indolence
and
sombre
reverie
formerly
habitual
to
her
once
or
twice
i
surprised
her
watching
me
in
wondering
perplexity
mme
laroque
too
often
looked
at
me
with
an
anxious
and
hesitating
air
as
if
she
wished
and
yet
feared
to
discuss
some
painful
subject
with
me
the
day
before
yesterday
i
found
myself
by
chance
alone
with
her
in
the
which
mlle
hélouin
had
just
left
to
give
some
order
the
trivial
conversation
in
which
we
had
been
engaged
ceased
suddenly
as
by
common
consent
after
a
short
silence
mme
laroque
said
in
a
voice
full
of
emotion
odiot
you
are
not
wise
in
your
choice
of
confidants
confidants
madame
i
do
not
follow
you
except
mlle
de
porhoët
i
have
had
no
confidant
in
this
place
alas
she
replied
i
wish
to
believe
you
i
believe
you
but
that
is
not
at
this
moment
mlle
hélouin
came
in
and
no
more
could
be
said
the
day
had
ridden
over
in
the
morning
to
superintend
some
in
the
neighbourhood
i
was
returning
to
the
château
about
four
in
the
afternoon
when
at
a
sharp
turn
of
the
road
i
found
myself
face
to
face
with
mlle
marguerite
she
was
alone
i
prepared
to
pass
her
with
a
bow
but
she
stopped
her
horse
what
a
fine
autumn
day
she
said
yes
mademoiselle
you
are
going
for
a
ride
as
you
see
i
am
making
the
best
of
my
moments
of
independence
and
in
fact
i
have
been
rather
abusing
my
liberty
for
i
am
somewhat
tired
of
solitude
but
alain
is
wanted
at
the
house
poor
mervyn
is
lame
you
would
not
care
to
take
his
place
with
pleasure
where
are
you
going
well
i
thought
of
riding
as
far
as
the
tower
of
elven
with
her
whip
she
indicated
the
misty
summit
of
a
hill
which
rose
on
the
right
of
the
road
i
think
she
went
on
you
ve
never
made
that
pilgrimage
i
have
not
i
have
often
meant
to
but
until
now
i
have
always
put
it
off
i
don
t
know
why
well
that
is
fortunate
but
it
is
getting
late
we
must
make
haste
if
you
don
t
mind
i
turned
my
horse
and
we
set
off
at
a
gallop
as
we
rode
along
i
tried
to
account
for
this
unexpected
fancy
which
had
an
air
of
premeditation
i
imagined
that
time
and
reflection
had
weakened
the
first
impression
that
calumnies
had
made
on
mlle
marguerite
apparently
she
had
conceived
some
doubts
of
mlle
hélouin
s
veracity
and
had
seized
an
opportunity
to
make
in
an
indirect
way
a
reparation
which
might
be
due
to
me
my
mind
full
of
such
preoccupations
i
gave
little
thought
to
the
particular
object
of
this
strange
ride
still
i
had
often
heard
the
tower
of
elven
described
as
one
of
the
most
interesting
ruins
of
the
country
i
had
never
gone
along
either
of
the
rennes
or
from
lead
to
the
sea
without
looking
longingly
at
the
confused
mass
rearing
up
suddenly
among
the
distant
heaths
like
some
huge
stone
on
end
but
i
had
had
neither
time
nor
opportunity
to
examine
it
slackening
our
pace
we
passed
through
the
village
of
elven
which
preserves
to
a
remarkable
extent
the
character
of
a
mediæval
hamlet
the
form
of
the
low
dark
houses
has
not
changed
for
five
or
six
centuries
you
think
you
are
dreaming
when
looking
into
the
big
arched
bays
which
serve
as
windows
you
see
the
groups
of
women
in
sculpturesque
costume
plying
their
distaffs
in
the
shade
and
talking
in
low
tones
an
unknown
tongue
these
gray
spectral
figures
seem
to
have
just
left
their
tombs
to
repeat
some
scene
of
a
bygone
age
of
which
you
are
the
only
witness
it
gives
a
sense
of
oppression
the
sluggish
life
that
stirs
around
you
in
the
single
street
of
the
village
has
the
same
stamp
of
archaic
strangeness
transmitted
from
a
vanished
world
a
little
way
from
elven
we
took
a
that
brought
us
to
the
top
of
a
bare
hillock
thence
though
still
some
distance
off
we
could
plainly
see
the
feudal
colossus
crowning
a
wooded
height
in
front
of
us
the
we
were
on
sloped
steeply
to
some
marshy
meadows
inclosed
by
thickets
we
descended
the
farther
side
and
soon
entered
the
woods
then
we
struck
a
narrow
causeway
the
rugged
pavement
of
which
must
once
have
rung
to
the
hoofs
of
horses
for
some
time
i
had
lost
sight
of
the
tower
of
elven
and
could
not
even
guess
where
it
was
when
all
at
once
it
stood
out
like
an
apparition
from
among
the
foliage
a
few
paces
in
front
of
us
the
tower
is
not
a
ruin
it
preserves
its
original
height
of
more
than
a
hundred
feet
and
the
irregular
courses
of
granite
which
make
up
its
splendid
octagonal
mass
give
it
the
appearance
of
a
huge
block
cut
out
but
yesterday
by
some
skilful
chisel
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
anything
more
proud
sombre
and
imposing
than
this
old
donjon
impassible
to
the
course
of
ages
and
lost
in
the
depths
of
the
forest
trees
have
sprung
up
in
the
deep
moats
which
surround
it
and
their
tops
scarcely
touch
the
openings
of
the
lowest
windows
this
gigantic
vegetation
which
entirely
conceals
the
base
of
the
edifice
completes
its
air
of
fantastic
mystery
in
this
solitude
among
these
forests
before
this
mass
of
weird
architecture
which
seems
to
start
up
suddenly
out
of
the
earth
one
thinks
involuntarily
of
those
enchanted
castles
in
which
beautiful
princesses
slept
for
centuries
awaiting
a
deliverer
so
far
said
mlle
marguerite
to
whom
i
had
endeavoured
to
convey
these
impressions
this
is
all
i
have
seen
of
it
but
if
you
want
to
wake
the
princess
we
can
go
in
i
believe
there
is
always
somewhere
near
a
shepherd
or
shepherdess
who
has
the
key
let
us
tie
up
the
horses
and
search
you
for
the
shepherd
and
i
for
the
shepherdess
we
put
the
horses
into
a
small
inclosure
near
and
separated
for
a
little
while
but
found
neither
shepherd
nor
shepherdess
of
course
this
increased
our
desire
to
visit
the
tower
crossing
a
bridge
over
the
moat
we
found
to
our
great
surprise
that
the
heavy
door
was
not
closed
we
pushed
it
and
entered
a
dark
and
narrow
space
choked
with
rubbish
which
may
have
been
the
we
passed
thence
into
a
large
almost
circular
hall
where
an
escutcheon
in
the
chimneypiece
still
displayed
the
bezants
of
a
crusader
a
large
window
faced
us
divided
by
the
symbolic
cross
clearly
carved
in
stone
it
lighted
all
the
lower
part
of
the
room
leaving
the
vaulted
and
ruined
ceiling
in
shadow
at
the
sound
of
our
steps
a
flock
of
birds
whirled
off
sending
the
dust
of
ages
on
to
our
heads
by
standing
on
the
granite
benches
which
ran
like
steps
along
the
side
of
the
walls
in
the
embrasure
of
the
window
we
could
see
the
moat
outside
and
the
ruined
parts
of
the
fortress
but
as
we
came
in
we
had
noticed
a
staircase
cut
out
of
the
solid
wall
and
we
were
childishly
eager
to
extend
our
discoveries
we
began
the
ascent
i
leading
and
mlle
marguerite
following
bravely
and
managing
her
long
skirts
as
best
she
could
the
view
from
the
platform
at
the
top
is
vast
and
exquisite
the
soft
hues
of
twilight
tinged
the
ocean
of
autumnal
foliage
the
gloomy
marshes
the
fresh
pastures
and
the
distant
horizons
of
intersecting
slopes
which
mingled
and
succeeded
each
other
in
endless
perspective
gazing
on
this
gracious
landscape
in
its
infinite
melancholy
the
peace
of
solitude
the
silence
of
evening
the
poetry
of
ancient
days
fell
like
some
potent
spell
upon
our
hearts
and
spirits
this
hour
of
common
contemplation
and
emotions
of
purest
deepest
pleasure
no
doubt
the
last
i
should
spend
with
her
i
entered
into
with
an
almost
painful
violence
of
enjoyment
i
do
not
know
what
marguerite
was
feeling
she
had
sat
down
on
the
ledge
of
the
parapet
and
was
gazing
into
the
distance
in
silence
i
can
not
say
how
many
moments
passed
in
this
way
when
the
mists
gathered
in
the
lower
meadows
and
the
distant
landscape
began
to
fade
into
the
growing
darkness
marguerite
rose
come
she
said
in
a
low
voice
as
if
the
curtain
had
fallen
on
some
beautiful
spectacle
come
it
s
over
she
began
to
descend
the
stairs
and
i
followed
her
but
when
we
tried
to
get
out
of
the
donjon
to
our
great
surprise
we
found
the
door
closed
most
likely
the
doorkeeper
not
knowing
that
we
were
there
had
locked
it
while
we
were
on
the
platform
at
first
this
amused
us
the
tower
was
really
an
enchanted
tower
i
made
some
vigorous
efforts
to
break
the
spell
but
the
huge
bolt
of
the
old
lock
was
firmly
fixed
in
its
granite
socket
and
i
had
to
give
up
all
hope
of
moving
it
i
attacked
the
door
itself
but
the
massive
hinges
and
the
oak
panels
studded
with
iron
stolidly
resisted
all
my
efforts
some
stone
mullions
which
i
found
among
the
rubbish
and
hurled
against
the
door
only
shook
the
vault
and
brought
some
fragments
from
it
to
our
feet
mlle
marguerite
at
last
made
me
give
up
a
task
that
was
hopeless
and
not
without
danger
i
then
ran
to
the
window
and
shouted
but
no
one
replied
for
ten
minutes
i
continued
shouting
and
to
no
purpose
we
took
advantage
of
the
last
rays
of
light
to
explore
the
interior
of
the
donjon
very
carefully
but
the
door
which
was
as
good
as
walled
up
for
us
and
the
large
window
thirty
feet
above
the
moat
were
the
only
exits
we
could
discover
meanwhile
night
had
fallen
on
the
fields
and
the
shadows
deepened
in
the
old
tower
the
moonbeams
shone
in
through
the
window
streaking
the
steps
with
oblique
white
lines
mlle
marguerite
s
gaiety
had
gradually
died
away
and
she
had
even
ceased
to
answer
the
more
or
less
probable
conjectures
with
which
i
still
tried
to
calm
her
apprehensions
while
she
kept
silent
and
immovable
in
the
shadow
i
sat
in
the
full
light
on
the
step
nearest
the
window
still
shouting
at
intervals
for
help
but
to
speak
the
truth
the
more
uncertain
the
success
of
my
attempts
became
the
more
i
was
conscious
of
a
feeling
of
irresistible
joyfulness
for
suddenly
i
saw
the
eternal
and
impossible
dream
of
lovers
realized
for
me
i
was
shut
in
the
heart
of
a
desert
and
in
the
most
complete
solitude
with
the
woman
i
loved
for
long
hours
there
would
be
but
she
and
i
in
the
world
but
her
life
and
mine
i
thought
of
all
the
sweet
evidences
of
protection
and
of
tender
respect
it
would
be
my
right
and
my
duty
to
show
her
i
imagined
her
fears
at
rest
her
confidence
restored
finally
her
slumbers
guarded
by
me
i
told
myself
in
rapture
that
this
auspicious
night
though
it
could
not
give
me
her
love
would
at
least
insure
me
her
unalterable
respect
as
i
yielded
with
the
egotism
of
passion
to
my
secret
ecstasy
some
trace
of
which
perhaps
expressed
itself
in
my
face
i
was
suddenly
awakened
by
these
words
spoken
in
a
dull
tone
and
with
affected
calm
le
marquis
de
champcey
have
there
been
many
cowards
in
your
family
before
you
i
rose
and
immediately
fell
back
again
on
the
stone
bench
looking
stupidly
into
the
darkness
where
i
saw
dimly
the
ghostly
figure
of
the
young
girl
only
one
idea
occurred
to
terrible
grief
and
fear
had
affected
her
she
was
going
mad
marguerite
i
cried
without
knowing
that
i
spoke
the
word
no
doubt
put
a
climax
to
her
irritation
my
god
this
is
hateful
she
continued
it
is
cowardly
i
repeat
it
is
cowardly
i
began
to
see
the
truth
i
descended
one
of
the
steps
what
is
the
matter
i
said
coldly
she
replied
with
abrupt
vehemence
you
paid
that
man
or
child
whichever
it
was
to
shut
us
up
in
this
wretched
tower
i
shall
be
ruined
my
reputation
lost
then
i
shall
have
perforce
to
belong
to
you
that
was
your
calculation
wasn
t
it
but
i
warn
you
it
will
not
serve
you
any
better
than
the
rest
you
still
know
me
very
little
if
you
think
i
would
not
prefer
dishonour
the
convent
death
anything
to
the
vileness
of
yielding
my
yours
and
suppose
this
infamous
trick
had
succeeded
suppose
i
had
been
weak
of
a
surety
i
never
shall
yield
myself
and
what
you
covet
more
my
fortune
to
you
what
kind
of
a
man
can
you
be
what
mud
are
you
made
of
to
desire
wealth
and
a
wife
by
such
means
ah
you
may
thank
me
for
not
yielding
to
your
wishes
they
are
imprudent
believe
me
for
if
ever
shame
and
public
ridicule
drove
me
to
your
arms
i
have
such
a
contempt
for
you
that
i
would
break
your
heart
yes
were
it
as
hard
and
cold
as
these
stones
i
would
press
blood
and
tears
from
it
mademoiselle
i
said
with
all
the
calm
i
could
command
i
beg
you
to
return
to
yourself
to
your
senses
on
my
honour
i
assure
you
that
you
do
me
injustice
think
for
a
moment
your
suspicions
are
quite
absurd
in
no
possible
way
could
i
have
accomplished
the
treachery
of
which
you
accuse
me
and
even
if
i
could
have
done
so
when
have
i
ever
given
you
the
right
to
think
me
capable
of
it
everything
i
know
of
you
gives
me
this
right
she
cried
lashing
the
air
with
her
whip
i
will
tell
you
once
for
all
what
has
been
in
my
thoughts
for
a
long
time
why
did
you
come
into
our
house
under
a
false
name
in
a
false
character
my
mother
and
i
were
happy
and
at
peace
you
have
brought
trouble
anxiety
and
sorrow
upon
us
to
attain
your
object
to
restore
your
fallen
fortunes
you
usurped
our
confidence
you
destroyed
our
peace
you
have
played
with
our
purest
deepest
and
holiest
feelings
you
have
bruised
and
shattered
our
hearts
without
pity
that
is
what
you
have
done
or
tried
to
do
it
doesn
t
matter
which
well
i
am
utterly
weary
of
utterly
disgusted
with
all
this
i
tell
you
plainly
and
when
now
you
offer
to
pledge
your
honour
as
a
gentleman
the
honour
that
has
already
allowed
you
to
do
so
many
unworthy
things
certainly
i
have
the
right
not
to
believe
in
do
not
believe
in
it
i
lost
all
control
of
myself
i
seized
her
hands
in
a
transport
of
violence
which
daunted
her
marguerite
my
poor
child
listen
i
love
you
it
is
true
and
a
love
more
passionate
more
disinterested
more
holy
never
possessed
the
heart
of
man
but
love
me
too
unhappy
girl
you
love
me
and
you
are
killing
me
you
talk
of
a
bruised
and
a
broken
heart
what
have
you
done
to
mine
but
it
is
yours
i
give
it
up
to
you
as
for
my
honour
i
keep
it
it
is
intact
and
before
long
i
shall
compel
you
to
acknowledge
this
and
on
that
honour
i
swear
that
if
i
die
you
will
weep
for
me
that
if
i
though
you
never
were
you
on
your
knees
before
me
would
i
marry
you
unless
you
were
as
poor
as
i
or
i
as
rich
as
you
and
now
pray
pray
ask
god
for
a
miracle
it
is
time
then
i
pushed
her
roughly
far
from
the
embrasure
and
sprang
on
to
the
highest
step
a
desperate
idea
had
come
to
me
i
carried
it
out
with
the
precipitation
of
positive
madness
as
i
have
said
the
tops
of
the
beeches
and
oaks
that
grew
in
the
moat
were
on
the
level
of
the
window
with
my
bent
whip
i
drew
the
ends
of
the
nearest
branches
to
me
seized
them
at
random
and
let
myself
drop
into
the
void
i
heard
my
maxime
with
a
wild
cry
above
my
head
the
branches
i
held
bent
their
full
length
towards
the
abyss
there
was
an
ominous
crack
and
they
broke
under
my
weight
i
fell
heavily
on
the
ground
the
muddy
nature
of
the
soil
must
have
deadened
the
shock
for
i
felt
that
i
was
alive
though
a
good
deal
hurt
one
of
my
arms
had
struck
the
stonework
of
the
moat
and
i
was
in
such
pain
that
i
fainted
marguerite
s
despairing
voice
recalled
me
to
myself
maxime
maxime
she
cried
for
pity
s
sake
for
god
s
sake
speak
to
me
forgive
me
i
got
up
and
saw
her
in
the
bay
of
the
window
standing
in
an
aureole
of
pale
light
her
head
bare
her
hair
loose
her
hands
grasping
the
bar
of
the
cross
while
her
glowing
eyes
searched
the
dark
abyss
don
t
be
alarmed
i
said
i
m
not
hurt
only
be
patient
for
an
hour
or
two
give
me
time
to
get
to
the
is
the
best
place
to
go
you
may
be
sure
i
shall
keep
your
secret
and
save
your
honour
as
i
have
just
saved
my
own
i
scrambled
painfully
out
of
the
moat
and
went
to
look
for
my
horse
i
used
my
handkerchief
as
a
sling
for
my
left
arm
which
was
quite
disabled
and
gave
me
great
pain
the
night
was
clear
and
i
found
the
way
easily
an
hour
later
i
was
at
the
château
they
told
me
that
desmarets
was
in
the
i
hurried
there
and
found
him
and
a
dozen
others
all
looking
anxious
and
alarmed
doctor
i
said
lightly
as
i
came
in
my
horse
shied
at
his
own
shadow
and
came
down
in
the
road
i
think
my
left
arm
is
put
out
will
you
see
eh
what
out
said
desmarets
after
he
had
removed
the
handkerchief
your
arm
s
broken
my
poor
boy
mme
laroque
started
up
with
a
little
scream
and
came
towards
me
it
seems
we
are
to
have
an
evening
of
misfortunes
she
said
what
else
has
happened
i
asked
as
if
surprised
i
am
afraid
my
daughter
must
have
had
an
accident
she
went
out
on
horseback
about
three
it

and
she
has
not

immediately
at
first
i
pretended
that
i
meant
to
be
of
the
party
but
mme
laroque
and
the
doctor
would
not
hear
of
it
without
much
trouble
i
was
persuaded
to
take
to
my
bed
which
truth
to
tell
i
needed
badly
desmarets
attended
to
my
arm
and
then
drove
away
with
mme
laroque
who
was
to
await
the
result
of
the
search
inaugurated
by
de
bévallan
at
the
village
of
elven
about
ten
o
clock
alain
came
to
tell
me
that
mlle
marguerite
had
been
found
he
related
the
story
of
her
imprisonment
without
omitting
any
details
except
of
course
those
known
only
to
me
and
the
young
girl
the
news
was
soon
confirmed
by
the
doctor
and
afterwards
by
mme
laroque
and
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
that
no
one
suspected
what
had
actually
occurred
i
passed
the
night
in
repeating
the
dangerous
leap
from
the
window
of
the
donjon
with
all
the
grotesque
complications
of
fever
and
delirium
i
did
not
get
used
to
it
every
moment
the
sensation
of
falling
through
emptiness
caught
me
by
the
throat
and
i
awoke
breathless
at
last
day
came
and
i
got
calm
at
eight
o
clock
mlle
de
porhoët
came
in
and
took
her
place
at
my
bedside
with
her
knitting
in
her
hand
she
did
the
honours
of
my
room
to
the
visitors
who
followed
one
another
throughout
the
day
mme
laroque
was
the
first
after
my
old
friend
as
she
held
my
hand
and
pressed
it
earnestly
i
saw
tears
on
her
face
has
her
daughter
confided
in
her
mlle
de
porhoët
told
me
that
old
laroque
had
been
confined
to
his
bed
since
yesterday
he
had
a
slight
attack
of
paralysis
he
can
not
speak
and
they
are
much
alarmed
about
him
the
marriage
is
to
be
hastened
laubépin
has
been
sent
for
from
paris
he
is
expected
and
the
contract
will
be
signed
the
following
day
under
his
direction
i
have
been
able
to
sit
up
for
some
hours
this
evening
but
according
to
desmarets
i
should
not
have
written
while
the
fever
was
on
me
and
i
am
a
great
idiot
really
it
seems
as
if
some
malign
power
were
hard
at
work
devising
the
strangest
and
most
cruel
tests
for
my
conscience
and
heart
alternately
laubépin
not
having
arrived
this
morning
mme
laroque
has
asked
me
to
give
her
some
of
the
information
necessary
for
drawing
up
the
general
conditions
of
the
contract
which
is
to
be
signed
as
i
am
obliged
to
keep
my
room
for
some
days
yet
i
asked
mme
laroque
to
send
me
the
and
private
documents
in
her
s
possession
as
they
were
indispensable
for
the
clearing
up
of
the
points
she
had
mentioned
to
me
very
soon
they
brought
me
two
or
three
drawers
full
of
papers
which
they
had
taken
out
of
laroque
s
cabinet
while
he
was
asleep
for
the
old
gentleman
would
never
let
any
one
touch
his
secret
archives
on
the
first
paper
that
i
took
up
i
saw
my
family
name
repeated
several
times
my
curiosity
was
irresistibly
aroused
here
is
the
literal
text
of
the
document
to
my
children
the
name
i
bequeath
to
you
and
which
i
have
honoured
is
not
mine
my
father
s
name
was
savage
he
was
overseer
of
a
large
plantation
in
the
island
of
lucia
then
french
which
belonged
to
a
rich
and
noble
family
of
champcey
d
hauterives
in
my
father
died
and
though
i
was
quite
young
i
succeeded
to
the
trust
the
champceys
reposed
in
him
towards
the
end
of
that
disastrous
year
the
french
antilles
were
taken
by
the
english
or
given
up
to
them
by
the
rebel
colonists
the
marquis
of
champcey
d
hauterive
whom
the
orders
of
the
convention
had
not
yet
struck
down
then
commanded
the
frigate
which
had
been
cruising
on
this
coast
for
three
years
a
good
number
of
the
french
colonists
of
the
antilles
had
succeeded
in
realizing
their
fortunes
which
had
been
in
imminent
peril
they
had
arranged
with
the
commandant
de
champcey
to
get
together
a
fleet
of
light
transports
to
which
their
property
had
been
transferred
and
which
was
to
sail
for
france
under
the
protection
of
the
guns
of
the
in
view
of
imminent
disasters
i
had
myself
received
a
long
time
back
an
order
and
authority
to
sell
the
plantation
at
any
price
on
the
night
of
november
i
put
out
alone
in
a
boat
for
the
point
of
and
secretly
left
lucia
already
occupied
by
the
enemy
i
brought
with
me
in
english
notes
and
guineas
the
amount
i
had
received
for
the
plantation
de
champcey
thanks
to
his
intimate
knowledge
of
the
coast
had
slipped
past
the
english
cruiser
and
had
taken
refuge
in
the
dangerous
and
unknown
channel
of
he
had
instructed
me
to
join
him
there
this
night
and
only
awaited
my
arrival
to
leave
the
channel
with
his
convoy
and
make
for
france
in
crossing
i
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
english
these
experts
in
treason
gave
me
the
choice
of
being
shot
on
the
spot
or
of
selling
them
for
the
million
i
had
with
me
which
they
agreed
to
leave
in
my
hands
the
secret
of
the
channel
where
the
fleet
was
hiding
i
was
young
the
temptation
was
too
great
half
an
hour
later
the
was
sunk
the
convoy
taken
and
de
champcey
seriously
wounded
a
year
year
without
sleep
i
was
going
mad
i
determined
to
make
the
cursed
english
pay
for
the
remorse
i
suffered
i
went
to
guadeloupe
i
changed
my
name
i
devoted
the
larger
part
of
the
money
i
had
received
to
the
purchase
of
an
armed
brig
and
i
fell
upon
the
english
for
fifteen
years
i
washed
in
their
blood
and
my
own
the
stain
that
in
an
hour
of
weakness
i
had
brought
on
my
country
s
flag
though
three
parts
of
my
fortune
have
been
acquired
in
honourable
combats
its
origin
was
nevertheless
the
price
of
my
treachery
returning
to
france
in
my
old
age
i
ascertained
the
position
of
the
champcey
d
hauterives
and
found
that
they
were
happy
and
wealthy
i
kept
my
own
counsel
i
ask
my
children
to
forgive
me
while
i
lived
i
had
not
the
courage
to
blush
before
them
my
death
will
reveal
this
secret
to
them
they
must
use
it
as
their
consciences
may
direct
for
myself
i
have
only
one
prayer
to
address
to
them
soon
or
late
there
will
be
a
final
war
between
france
and
her
neighbour
we
hate
one
another
too
much
there
s
nothing
else
to
be
done
either
we
must
devour
them
or
they
must
devour
us
if
this
war
should
be
declared
during
the
life
of
my
children
or
i
desire
that
they
give
to
the
state
a
corvette
fully
armed
and
completely
equipped
on
one
condition
that
it
shall
be
called
the
savage
and
be
commanded
by
a
breton
at
each
broadside
she
shall
send
on
to
the
carthaginian
shore
my
bones
will
tremble
with
joy
in
my
grave
richard
savage
called
laroque
the
memories
that
this
terrible
confession
awakened
convinced
me
that
it
was
correct
twenty
times
i
had
heard
my
father
relate
with
pride
and
indignation
this
incident
in
my
ancestor
s
career
but
in
the
family
we
believed
that
richard
remember
the
name
quite
been
the
victim
and
not
the
contriver
of
the
treason
or
mischance
which
had
betrayed
the
commandant
of
the
now
i
understand
the
peculiarities
i
had
often
noticed
in
the
old
sailor
s
character
and
especially
his
thoughtful
and
timid
bearing
towards
me
my
father
had
always
told
me
that
i
was
the
living
portrait
of
my
grandfather
the
marquis
jacques
and
perhaps
some
dim
perception
of
this
resemblance
had
penetrated
to
the
old
man
s
troubled
brain
this
revelation
threw
me
into
a
terrible
perplexity
i
felt
but
little
resentment
against
the
unhappy
man
who
had
redeemed
a
moment
of
weakness
by
a
long
life
of
repentance
and
by
a
passion
of
desperation
and
hatred
which
was
not
without
greatness
nor
could
i
without
admiration
breathe
the
wild
blast
which
animated
the
lines
written
by
this
guilty
but
heroic
hand
still
what
was
i
to
do
with
this
terrible
secret
my
first
thought
was
that
it
removed
all
obstacles
between
marguerite
and
me
that
henceforth
the
fortune
that
had
kept
us
apart
would
be
almost
an
obligatory
bond
for
i
was
the
only
person
in
the
world
who
could
regularize
her
title
to
it
by
sharing
it
with
her
but
in
truth
this
secret
did
not
belong
to
me
and
though
i
had
learned
it
by
the
purest
of
accidents
strict
honesty
perhaps
demanded
that
i
should
leave
it
to
come
at
its
own
time
into
the
hands
for
which
it
was
destined
but
while
i
waited
for
that
moment
the
irreparable
would
be
accomplished
eternal
bonds
were
to
be
forged
the
tomb
was
to
close
over
my
love
my
hopes
and
my
sorrowful
heart
and
should
i
allow
it
when
i
might
prevent
it
by
a
single
word
and
the
day
these
poor
women
learned
the
truth
and
blushed
with
shame
to
learn
it
perhaps
they
would
share
my
regret
and
despair
they
would
be
the
first
to
cry
ah
if
you
knew
why
did
you
not
speak
no
neither
nor
nor
ever
shall
those
noble
women
blush
for
shame
if
i
can
prevent
it
my
happiness
shall
not
be
bought
at
the
price
of
their
humiliation
this
secret
is
mine
alone
the
old
man
henceforth
speechless
can
not
betray
himself
the
secret
does
not
exist
the
flames
have
destroyed
it
i
pondered
it
well
i
know
what
i
have
dared
to
do
it
was
a
will
a
sacred
document
and
i
have
destroyed
it
moreover
it
did
not
benefit
me
alone
my
sister
who
is
intrusted
to
my
care
might
have
found
a
fortune
there
and
without
consulting
her
i
have
plunged
her
back
into
poverty
i
know
all
that
but
i
will
not
allow
two
pure
proud
souls
to
be
crushed
and
dishonoured
by
the
burden
of
a
crime
of
which
they
are
ignorant
there
is
a
principle
of
equity
at
stake
far
superior
to
mere
literal
justice
if
in
my
turn
i
have
committed
a
crime
i
will
answer
for
it
but
the
struggle
has
exhausted
me
i
can
do
no
more
now
laubépin
after
all
arrived
yesterday
he
came
to
see
me
he
was
brusque
preoccupied
and
seemed
he
spoke
briefly
of
the
marriage
a
very
satisfactory
business
he
said
in
all
respects
an
excellent
combination
where
nature
and
society
both
receive
the
guarantees
they
have
the
right
to
require
in
such
matters
and
so
young
man
i
have
to
smooth
the
delicate
ground
of
the
preliminary
agreements
that
the
hymeneal
car
of
this
interesting
union
may
reach
its
goal
without
jolting
at
one
o
clock
this
afternoon
the
family
assembled
in
the
with
all
the
preparations
and
formalities
observed
at
the
signing
of
a
marriage
contract
i
could
not
attend
this
ceremony
and
i
blessed
my
broken
arm
for
sparing
me
the
trial
about
three
i
was
writing
to
little
hélène
and
taking
care
to
assure
her
more
strongly
than
ever
of
my
complete
devotion
to
her
when
laubépin
and
mlle
de
porhoët
came
into
my
room
in
his
frequent
visits
to
laroque
laubépin
has
learnt
to
appreciate
my
venerable
friend
and
the
two
old
people
have
formed
a
respectful
and
platonic
attachment
which
desmarets
tries
in
vain
to
misrepresent
after
an
exchange
of
ceremonies
of
interminable
bows
and
courtesies
they
took
the
chairs
i
offered
them
and
both
set
about
considering
me
with
an
air
of
grave
beatitude
well
i
said
it
s
over
yes
they
replied
in
chorus
it
s
over
it
went
off
well
very
well
said
mlle
de
porhoët
wonderfully
well
said
laubépin
after
a
pause
he
added
bévallan
s
gone
to
the
devil
and
the
young
hélouin
after
him
continued
mlle
de
porhoët
i
exclaimed
in
surprise
good
god
what
has
happened
my
friend
said
laubépin
the
contemplated
union
had
every
possible
advantage
and
it
would
have
without
doubt
insured
the
common
happiness
of
both
the
parties
concerned
if
marriage
were
a
purely
commercial
partnership
but
it
is
nothing
of
the
sort
as
my
assistance
had
been
asked
i
thought
it
my
duty
to
bear
in
mind
the
inclination
of
the
hearts
and
the
agreement
of
the
character
just
as
much
as
the
relative
proportions
of
the
estates
now
from
the
first
i
had
the
impression
that
the
contemplated
marriage
had
one
drawback
it
pleased
no
one
neither
my
excellent
friend
mme
laroque
nor
the
amiable
nor
their
most
sensible
one
in
fact
except
perhaps
the
about
whom
i
trouble
myself
very
slightly
it
is
true
i
quote
here
from
mlle
de
porhoët
it
is
true
i
say
that
the
is
a
if
you
please
mlle
de
porhoët
interrupted
severely
a
continued
laubépin
accepting
the
correction
but
it
is
a
kind
of
i
don
t
care
for
nor
i
said
mlle
de
porhoët
there
are
curious
specimens
of
the
kind
dissipated
stablemen
such
as
those
whom
we
saw
last
century
deserting
their
english
stables
under
the
direction
of
the
duc
de
chartres
to
come
over
here
and
prepare
the
revolution
oh
if
they
had
only
prepared
the
revolution
said
laubépin
sententiously
we
should
forgive
them
a
million
apologies
my
dear
sir
for
yourself
besides
that
is
not
the
question
will
you
go
on
so
continued
laubépin
seeing
that
every
one
was
approaching
this
wedding
as
if
it
were
a
funeral
i
searched
for
some
honourable
and
legal
means
not
to
break
the
engagement
with
de
bévallan
but
to
get
him
to
withdraw
voluntarily
this
proceeding
was
the
more
justifiable
as
in
my
absence
de
bévallan
had
profited
by
the
inexperience
of
my
excellent
friend
mme
laroque
and
the
weakness
of
my
colleague
in
the
neighbouring
town
to
make
the
most
exorbitant
demand
in
his
own
interests
without
departing
from
the
wording
of
the
agreements
i
succeeded
in
materially
altering
their
spirit
but
there
were
limits
which
honour
and
the
engagements
already
entered
into
forbade
me
to
pass
and
the
contract
remained
favourable
enough
to
be
accepted
with
confidence
by
any
man
who
had
a
sincere
affection
for
his
betrothed
was
de
bévallan
such
a
man
we
had
to
take
that
risk
i
confess
that
i
was
not
free
from
emotion
when
i
began
to
read
the
irrevocable
document
before
an
imposing
audience
this
morning
as
for
me
interrupted
mlle
de
porhoët
i
hadn
t
a
drop
of
blood
left
in
my
veins
the
first
part
of
the
contract
conceded
so
much
to
the
enemy
that
i
thought
all
was
lost
no
doubt
mademoiselle
but
as
we
augurs
say
among
ourselves
the
sting
is
in
the
tail
cauda
it
was
comical
my
friend
to
see
the
faces
of
de
bévallan
and
my
from
rennes
who
assisted
him
when
i
suddenly
unmasked
my
batteries
at
first
they
looked
at
each
other
in
silence
then
they
whispered
together
at
last
they
rose
and
coming
to
the
table
where
i
sat
asked
me
in
a
low
voice
for
an
explanation
speak
up
gentlemen
if
you
please
i
said
to
them
we
must
have
no
mysteries
here
what
have
you
to
say
the
company
began
to
prick
up
their
ears
without
raising
his
voice
de
bévallan
suggested
to
me
that
the
contract
showed
mistrust
mistrust
sir
i
replied
in
my
most
impressive
tone
what
do
you
intend
to
convey
by
that
do
you
make
that
strange
imputation
against
mme
laroque
or
against
me
or
against
my
here
present
silence
no
wrangling
said
the
rennes
notary
discreetly
but
listen
it
was
agreed
in
the
first
place
that
the
legal
system
of
dotation
should
not
be
insisted
the
legal
system
and
where
do
you
find
that
mentioned
oh
my
dear
sir
you
know
that
you
have
practically
reconstituted
it
by
a
subterfuge
monsieur
allow
me
as
your
senior
to
advise
you
to
withdraw
that
word
from
your
but
after
all
murmured
de
bévallan
i
m
tied
hand
and
foot
and
treated
like
a
indeed
sir
what
in
your
opinion
are
we
here
for
at
this
contract
or
a
will
you
forget
that
mme
laroque
is
living
that
her
father
is
living
and
that
it
is
a
question
of
marriage
not
of
least
not
yet
really
you
must
have
a
little
patience
you
must
wait
a
at
these
words
mlle
marguerite
rose
that
is
enough
she
m
laubépin
throw
that
contract
into
the
fire
mother
let
this
gentleman
s
presents
be
then
she
rose
and
left
us
like
an
outraged
queen
mme
laroque
followed
her
and
at
the
same
time
i
threw
the
contract
into
the
fireplace
sir
said
de
bévallan
in
a
threatening
tone
there
s
some
trickery
in
this
and
i
will
find
it
sir
i
replied
allow
me
to
explain
it
to
you
a
young
lady
who
with
a
just
pride
values
herself
very
highly
feared
that
your
offer
might
have
been
influenced
by
her
wealth
she
wished
to
be
certain
she
has
no
longer
any
doubts
i
have
the
honour
to
wish
you
thereupon
my
friend
i
went
after
the
ladies
my
embraced
me
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
de
bévallan
left
the
château
with
my
colleague
from
rennes
his
departure
and
disgrace
have
naturally
loosened
the
servants
tongues
and
very
soon
his
imprudent
intrigue
with
mlle
hélouin
was
revealed
the
young
lady
already
suspected
on
other
grounds
for
some
time
past
has
asked
to
be
released
from
her
duties
and
the
request
has
been
granted
it
is
needless
to
say
that
our
ladies
will
secure
her
future
well
my
dear
fellow
what
do
you
say
to
all
this
are
you
worse
you
re
as
pale
as
death
this
unexpected
news
had
aroused
so
many
and
i
felt
myself
on
the
point
of
losing
consciousness
laubépin
who
has
to
leave
at
daybreak
came
back
this
evening
to
wish
me
farewell
after
some
embarrassed
remarks
from
us
both
he
said
never
mind
my
dear
boy
i
ll
not
you
on
what
is
going
on
here
but
if
you
should
require
a
confidant
and
a
counsellor
i
ask
you
to
give
me
the
preference
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
could
not
confide
in
a
heart
more
sympathetic
or
more
friendly
i
gave
the
worthy
old
gentleman
the
particulars
of
my
relations
with
mlle
marguerite
i
even
read
some
pages
of
this
journal
to
him
to
show
him
more
exactly
the
state
of
affairs
and
also
the
state
of
my
heart
i
hid
nothing
from
him
save
laroque
s
secret
when
i
had
finished
laubépin
who
had
suddenly
become
very
thoughtful
began
it
is
useless
to
conceal
from
you
my
friend
that
when
i
sent
you
here
i
intended
you
to
marry
mlle
laroque
at
first
everything
went
as
i
wished
your
hearts
which
i
believe
are
worthy
of
one
another
could
not
associate
without
sympathizing
but
this
strange
event
of
which
the
tower
of
elven
was
the
romantic
scene
entirely
disconcerts
me
i
must
confess
allow
me
to
tell
you
my
young
friend
that
to
jump
out
of
window
at
the
risk
of
breaking
your
neck
was
in
itself
a
more
than
sufficient
proof
of
your
disinterestedness
it
was
quite
superfluous
to
add
to
this
honourable
and
considerate
proceeding
a
solemn
oath
never
to
marry
this
poor
girl
except
in
contingencies
we
can
not
possibly
expect
to
see
realized
i
pride
myself
on
being
a
man
of
i
fully
recognise
that
i
can
not
give
you
two
hundred
thousand
francs
or
take
them
away
from
mlle
laroque
then
tell
me
what
to
do
sir
i
have
more
confidence
in
you
than
in
myself
for
i
see
that
misfortune
which
is
always
exposed
to
suspicion
has
made
me
excessively
susceptible
on
questions
of
honour
speak
do
you
counsel
me
to
forget
the
imprudent
but
still
solemn
oath
which
alone
at
this
moment
separates
me
from
the
happiness
you
had
imagined
for
your
adopted
son
laubépin
rose
his
thick
eyebrows
drawn
down
over
his
eyes
he
strode
about
the
room
for
some
minutes
then
stopping
in
front
of
me
and
seizing
my
hand
he
said
young
man
it
is
true
that
i
love
you
like
my
own
child
but
even
at
the
cost
of
breaking
your
heart
and
my
own
i
will
not
be
false
to
my
principles
it
is
better
in
matters
of
honour
do
too
much
than
too
little
and
as
regards
oaths
all
those
that
are
not
extorted
at
the
point
of
the
knife
or
the
mouth
of
a
pistol
should
either
not
be
taken
or
should
be
kept
that
is
my
opinion
it
is
mine
too
i
will
leave
with
you
morning
no
maxime
stay
here
a
little
longer
i
do
not
believe
in
miracles
but
i
believe
in
god
who
seldom
allows
us
to
be
ruined
by
our
virtues
give
providence
more
time
i
know
that
i
am
asking
a
very
courageous
effort
from
you
but
i
claim
it
formally
from
your
friendship
if
within
a
month
you
do
not
hear
from
you
can
leave
he
embraced
me
and
left
me
to
my
quiet
conscience
and
my
desolate
heart
it
is
now
two
days
since
i
have
been
able
to
leave
my
retirement
and
appear
at
the
château
i
had
not
seen
mlle
marguerite
since
we
separated
at
the
tower
of
elven
she
was
alone
in
the
when
i
entered
recognising
me
she
effort
to
rise
then
she
sat
motionless
and
a
flood
of
burning
crimson
dyed
her
face
it
was
infectious
for
i
felt
that
i
was
blushing
to
the
forehead
how
are
you
m
odiot
she
said
holding
out
her
hand
and
she
spoke
these
simple
words
so
gently
so
so
tenderly
i
longed
to
throw
myself
on
my
knees
before
her
but
i
had
to
answer
in
a
tone
of
icy
politeness
she
looked
sadly
at
me
lowered
her
great
eyes
with
an
air
of
resignation
and
went
on
with
her
work
almost
at
the
same
moment
her
mother
called
to
her
to
come
to
her
grandfather
whose
condition
had
become
most
alarming
for
some
days
now
he
had
lost
voice
and
movement
the
paralysis
was
almost
total
the
last
gleams
of
mental
life
were
extinguished
only
physical
sensibility
and
the
capacity
for
suffering
remained
the
end
was
not
far
off
but
in
this
energetic
heart
life
was
too
deeply
rooted
to
be
relinquished
without
an
obstinate
struggle
the
doctor
had
foretold
that
his
agony
would
last
a
long
time
still
at
the
first
appearance
of
danger
mme
laroque
and
her
daughter
had
tended
him
with
the
passionate
and
utter
devotion
which
are
the
special
virtue
and
glory
of
their
sex
the
day
before
yesterday
they
broke
down
exhausted
desmarets
and
i
offered
to
take
their
places
by
laroque
and
they
agreed
to
have
a
few
hours
rest
the
doctor
who
was
very
much
fatigued
soon
told
me
that
he
was
going
to
throw
himself
on
the
bed
in
the
next
room
i
am
no
use
here
he
said
the
thing
is
over
you
see
the
poor
old
fellow
doesn
t
suffer
any
more
that
lethargic
state
is
not
painful
the
awakening
will
be
death
so
we
can
be
quiet
call
me
if
you
see
any
change
but
i
think
it
won
t
come
till
i
m
dying
for
a
sleep
he
gave
a
great
yawn
and
went
out
his
language
and
his
conduct
before
the
dying
man
had
shocked
me
he
is
an
excellent
man
but
to
render
to
death
the
respect
that
is
due
to
it
one
must
not
see
only
the
brute
matter
it
dissolves
but
believe
in
the
immortal
essence
it
releases
left
alone
in
the
chamber
of
death
i
sat
near
the
foot
of
the
bed
where
the
curtains
had
been
withdrawn
and
i
tried
to
read
by
a
lamp
that
stood
on
a
little
table
near
me
the
book
slipped
from
my
hands
i
could
think
only
of
the
strange
combination
of
events
which
after
so
many
years
gave
this
guilty
old
man
the
grandson
of
his
victim
as
witness
and
guardian
of
his
last
sleep
then
in
the
tranquility
of
that
hour
and
place
i
recalled
in
spite
of
myself
the
scenes
of
tumult
and
bloody
violence
which
had
filled
the
life
that
was
now
ebbing
away
i
looked
for
traces
of
it
on
the
face
of
the
dying
old
man
and
on
the
large
features
defined
in
the
shadow
with
the
pale
distinctness
of
a
plaster
mask
i
saw
only
the
solemnity
and
premature
peace
of
the
tomb
at
intervals
i
went
to
the
bedside
to
make
sure
that
the
weakened
breast
still
heaved
with
vital
breath
towards
the
middle
of
the
night
an
irresistible
torpor
seized
me
and
i
slept
leaning
my
forehead
on
my
hand
suddenly
i
was
awakened
by
a
strange
and
sinister
sound
i
looked
up
and
a
shudder
ran
through
the
marrow
of
my
bones
the
old
man
was
up
in
bed
staring
at
me
with
an
intent
astonished
look
and
an
expression
of
life
and
intelligence
that
i
had
not
seen
in
him
before
when
our
eyes
met
he
started
stretched
out
his
arms
and
said
in
a
beseeching
voice
whose
strange
unknown
quality
almost
stopped
the
beating
of
my
heart
marquis
forgive
me
in
vain
i
tried
to
rise
to
speak
i
sat
petrified
in
my
chair
after
a
silence
during
which
the
dying
man
s
eyes
were
still
fixed
on
mine
beseechingly
he
repeated
marquis
deign
to
forgive
me
at
last
i
summoned
up
strength
to
go
to
him
as
i
approached
he
drew
back
fearfully
as
if
shrinking
from
a
dreadful
contact
i
raised
my
hand
and
lowering
it
gently
before
his
staring
and
eyes
rest
in
peace
i
said
i
forgive
you
before
i
had
done
speaking
his
withered
face
lighted
up
with
a
flash
of
joy
and
youth
two
tears
burst
from
his
dry
and
sunken
orbits
he
stretched
a
hand
to
me
then
suddenly
the
hand
stiffened
in
a
threatening
gesture
and
i
saw
his
eyes
roll
between
their
dilated
lids
as
if
a
ball
had
gone
through
his
heart
oh
the
english
he
whispered
and
immediately
fell
back
on
the
pillow
like
a
log
he
was
dead
i
called
quickly
and
the
others
came
soon
he
was
surrounded
by
pious
mourners
weeping
and
praying
for
him
i
retired
my
soul
deeply
moved
by
this
extraordinary
scene
which
i
had
resolved
should
ever
remain
a
secret
between
myself
and
the
dead
man
this
sad
event
brought
me
cares
and
duties
which
i
needed
to
justify
me
in
my
own
eyes
for
remaining
in
the
house
i
can
not
fathom
laubépin
s
motives
for
advising
me
to
delay
my
departure
what
did
he
hope
from
it
to
me
he
seems
to
have
yielded
to
a
vague
presentiment
and
childish
weakness
to
which
a
man
of
his
stamp
should
never
have
given
way
and
to
which
i
also
was
wrong
to
submit
why
did
he
not
see
that
besides
bringing
additional
suffering
on
me
he
put
me
in
a
position
that
is
neither
manly
nor
dignified
what
am
i
to
do
here
now
would
they
not
have
good
reason
to
reproach
me
with
trifling
with
sacred
feelings
my
first
interview
with
mlle
marguerite
had
shown
me
how
hard
and
how
unbearable
was
the
trial
to
which
i
had
been
condemned
the
death
of
laroque
would
make
our
relations
easier
and
give
my
presence
a
sort
of
propriety
all
is
over
god
how
strong
that
tie
was
how
it
held
my
heart
and
how
it
has
torn
it
as
it
broke
yesterday
evening
about
nine
as
i
leaned
on
my
open
window
i
was
surprised
to
see
a
faint
light
coming
towards
my
house
through
the
dark
alleys
of
the
park
and
from
a
direction
which
the
servants
at
the
château
do
not
frequent
a
moment
afterward
there
was
a
knock
at
my
door
and
mlle
de
porhoët
came
in
breathless
cousin
she
said
i
have
business
with
you
i
looked
straight
at
her
a
misfortune
i
said
no
it
is
not
precisely
that
besides
you
shall
judge
for
yourself
my
dear
child
you
have
passed
two
or
three
evenings
this
week
at
the
château
have
you
noticed
nothing
unusual
nothing
peculiar
in
the
attitude
of
the
ladies
nothing
have
you
not
even
noticed
an
unusual
serenity
in
their
appearance
perhaps
i
have
allowing
for
the
melancholy
due
to
their
recent
sorrow
they
seemed
calmer
and
happier
than
before
no
doubt
other
things
would
have
struck
you
if
like
me
you
had
lived
in
daily
intimacy
with
them
for
fifteen
years
thus
i
have
observed
signs
of
some
secret
understanding
and
mysterious
agreement
between
them
moreover
their
habits
have
been
largely
altered
mme
laroque
has
given
up
her
her
and
all
her
little
creole
fancies
she
rises
at
marvellous
hours
and
at
daybreak
instals
herself
with
marguerite
at
the
they
are
both
taken
with
a
sudden
passion
for
embroidery
and
have
ascertained
how
much
a
woman
can
earn
at
that
work
in
a
day
in
short
there
is
a
riddle
to
which
i
can
not
find
the
answer
but
it
has
been
told
me
and
though
i
may
be
intruding
on
your
secrets
i
thought
it
right
to
inform
you
at
once
i
assured
mlle
porhoët
of
my
absolute
confidence
in
her
and
she
continued
mme
aubry
came
to
see
me
this
evening
secretly
she
began
by
throwing
her
wretched
arms
round
my
neck
which
displeased
me
very
much
then
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
thousand
jeremiads
about
i
will
spare
begged
me
to
stop
her
relations
on
the
brink
of
ruin
this
is
what
she
has
heard
through
listening
at
doors
according
to
her
pretty
habit
the
ladies
are
trying
to
get
permission
to
transfer
all
their
property
to
a
community
at
rennes
so
as
to
do
away
with
the
difference
of
fortune
which
separates
you
and
marguerite
as
they
can
t
make
you
rich
they
will
make
themselves
poor
i
thought
it
impossible
to
let
you
remain
ignorant
of
this
determination
which
is
equally
worthy
of
those
generous
souls
and
of
those
quixotic
heads
you
will
forgive
my
adding
that
it
is
your
duty
to
put
an
end
to
this
design
at
any
cost
i
need
not
point
out
the
regrets
it
will
infallibly
bring
to
our
friends
nor
the
terrible
responsibility
it
will
throw
on
you
that
you
will
see
at
a
glance
if
my
friend
you
can
from
this
moment
accept
the
hand
of
marguerite
everything
will
end
in
the
best
way
possible
but
in
that
respect
you
have
tied
yourself
by
an
engagement
which
is
not
the
less
binding
because
it
was
made
imprudently
and
blindly
there
is
then
only
one
thing
for
you
to
leave
this
country
and
resolutely
extinguish
all
the
hopes
that
your
presence
here
must
inevitably
encourage
when
you
are
no
longer
here
i
shall
have
less
difficulty
in
bringing
these
two
children
to
reason
very
well
i
am
ready
i
will
go
this
very
night
good
she
said
when
i
give
you
this
advice
i
obey
a
very
rigorous
law
of
honour
you
have
made
the
last
moments
of
my
long
solitude
pleasant
and
you
have
given
me
back
the
illusion
of
the
sweet
attachments
of
life
which
i
had
lost
for
so
many
years
in
sending
you
away
i
make
my
last
sacrifice
it
is
immense
she
rose
and
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
without
speaking
at
my
age
we
do
not
embrace
young
people
she
continued
smiling
sadly
we
bless
them
adieu
dear
child
and
thank
you
may
god
keep
you
i
kissed
her
trembling
hands
and
she
left
me
hastily
i
hurriedly
prepared
for
my
departure
and
then
wrote
a
few
lines
to
mme
laroque
i
begged
her
to
renounce
a
decision
the
effect
of
which
she
could
not
foresee
and
which
for
my
part
i
was
determined
to
have
no
share
in
i
gave
her
my
she
knew
she
could
rely
i
would
never
accept
my
happiness
at
the
cost
of
her
ruin
and
i
the
sake
of
dissuading
her
from
her
fantastic
speaking
vaguely
of
a
future
which
might
bring
me
fortune
at
midnight
when
everything
was
silent
i
said
farewell
a
bitter
farewell
to
the
old
tower
where
i
had
much
i
slipped
into
the
château
by
a
secret
door
of
which
i
had
the
key
furtively
like
a
criminal
i
passed
along
the
empty
and
resounding
galleries
guiding
myself
as
i
best
could
in
the
dark
at
last
i
reached
the
where
i
had
first
seen
her
she
and
her
mother
had
not
long
left
it
and
their
recent
presence
was
revealed
by
a
sweet
and
pleasant
perfume
which
transported
me
i
searched
and
i
touched
the
basket
where
a
few
moments
before
she
had
replaced
her
embroidery
alas
my
poor
heart
i
fell
on
my
knees
before
the
seat
she
generally
occupies
my
forehead
against
the
marble
i
wept
i
sobbed
like
a
child
god
how
i
loved
her
the
last
hours
of
the
night
i
spent
in
reaching
the
little
town
secretly
and
thence
i
drove
to
rennes
this
morning
evening
i
shall
be
in
paris
o
poverty
solitude
and
despair
which
i
had
left
there
i
shall
find
you
again
last
dream
of
of
heaven
farewell
paris
the
next
day
in
the
morning
as
i
went
to
the
railway
station
a
stood
in
the
courtyard
of
the
and
i
saw
old
alain
get
out
his
face
brightened
as
he
saw
me
oh
sir
what
good
luck
you
ve
not
gone
here
is
a
letter
for
you
i
recognised
laubépin
s
writing
he
said
that
mlle
de
porhoët
was
seriously
ill
and
was
asking
for
me
i
only
allowed
time
to
change
the
horses
and
threw
myself
into
the
chaise
after
forcing
alain
to
get
in
with
me
i
questioned
him
eagerly
and
made
him
repeat
his
news
which
seemed
incredible
the
evening
before
mlle
de
porhoët
had
received
an
official
despatch
through
laubépin
announcing
her
succession
to
the
entire
spanish
property
and
it
seems
said
alain
that
she
owes
it
to
you
sir
for
finding
some
old
papers
in
the
that
have
proved
the
old
lady
s
title
i
don
t
know
how
much
truth
there
is
in
this
but
if
it
is
so
what
a
pity
she
has
those
ideas
about
the
cathedral
and
won
t
give
them
up
for
she
s
more
bent
on
it
than
ever
when
she
first
got
the
news
she
fell
flat
on
the
floor
and
we
thought
she
was
dead
but
an
hour
after
she
began
talking
about
her
cathedral
the
choir
and
the
nave
the
north
aisle
and
the
south
the
chapter
and
the
canons
to
calm
her
we
had
to
fetch
an
architect
and
masons
and
put
the
plans
of
her
blessed
building
on
her
bed
at
last
after
three
hours
of
that
kind
of
talk
she
quieted
down
a
bit
and
dozed
when
she
awoke
she
asked
for
you
le
marquis
alain
bowed
closing
his
eyes
and
i
had
to
run
after
you
it
seems
she
wants
to
consult
you
about
the
this
strange
event
took
me
entirely
by
surprise
nevertheless
my
memory
aided
by
the
confused
details
given
me
by
alain
enabled
me
to
find
an
explanation
which
more
precise
information
completely
confirmed
as
i
have
before
said
the
affair
of
the
spanish
inheritance
of
the
porhoëts
had
gone
through
two
phases
there
had
first
been
a
long
lawsuit
between
mlle
de
porhoët
and
one
of
the
great
families
of
castile
which
my
old
friend
had
finally
lost
then
there
had
been
a
new
suit
between
the
spanish
heirs
and
the
crown
the
latter
claiming
on
the
grounds
of
intestacy
shortly
after
this
while
pursuing
my
researches
in
the
porhoët
archives
i
had
about
two
months
before
leaving
the
château
laid
hands
upon
a
curious
document
which
i
will
here
transcribe
don
philip

the
grace
of

and
served

with
exemplary
fidelity
i
promise
by
special
favour
that
in
case
of
the
extinction
of
thy
direct
and
legitimate
progeny
the
possessions
of
thy
house
shall
return
even
to
the
detriment
of
my
crown
to
the
direct
and
legitimate
descendants
of
the
french
branch
of

as
long
as
any
such
shall
exist
and
i
make
this
covenant
for
myself
and
for
my
successors
on
my
royal
faith
and
word
given
at
the
escorial
april
yo
el
rey
together
with
this
document
which
was
merely
a
translator
s
copy
i
found
the
original
text
bearing
the
arms
of
spain
the
importance
of
this
document
had
not
escaped
me
but
i
had
feared
to
exaggerate
it
i
greatly
doubted
whether
the
validity
of
a
title
of
such
ancient
date
and
prior
to
so
many
momentous
events
would
be
recognised
by
the
spanish
government
i
even
doubted
whether
it
would
have
the
power
to
give
effect
to
it
even
if
it
had
the
will
i
had
therefore
decided
to
say
nothing
to
mlle
de
porhoët
about
a
discovery
the
consequences
of
which
seemed
to
me
most
problematic
and
i
had
contented
myself
with
sending
the
document
to
laubépin
as
i
had
heard
nothing
more
of
it
i
had
soon
forgotten
it
in
the
midst
of
the
personal
cares
with
which
i
was
overwhelmed
at
the
time
however
contrary
to
my
unjust
suspicions
the
spanish
government
had
not
hesitated
to
carry
out
philip
v
s
covenant
and
at
the
very
moment
when
a
supreme
decree
had
handed
over
the
vast
possessions
of
the
porhoëts
to
the
crown
it
had
nobly
restored
them
to
the
legitimate
heir
about
nine
that
evening
i
stopped
at
the
humble
house
where
this
royal
fortune
had
arrived
so
tardily
the
little
servant
opened
the
door
she
was
crying
from
the
staircase
above
came
the
grave
voice
of
laubépin
it
is
he
said
the
voice
i
went
up
the
stairs
quickly
the
old
man
grasped
my
hand
warmly
and
took
me
into
mlle
de
porhoët
s
room
the
doctor
and
the
curé
stood
silent
in
the
shadow
of
the
window
mme
laroque
knelt
at
the
bedside
her
daughter
was
arranging
the
pillow
where
the
pale
face
of
my
old
friend
rested
when
the
sick
woman
saw
me
a
faint
smile
flickered
across
her
face
painfully
she
moved
one
of
her
arms
i
took
her
hand
i
fell
on
my
knees
i
could
not
keep
back
my
tears
my
child
she
said
my
dear
child
then
she
looked
intently
at
laubépin
the
old
notary
took
from
the
bed
a
piece
of
paper
and
as
if
he
were
continuing
to
read
after
an
interruption
he
went
on
for
these
reasons
he
read

my
astonishment
i
had
risen
and
was
about
to
speak
when
mlle
de
porhoët
gently
retaining
my
hand
placed
it
in
marguerite
s
at
this
sudden
contact
the
dear
creature
trembled
she
bent
her
young
forehead
on
the
mournful
pillow
and
blushing
whispered
something
in
the
dying
woman
s
ear
i
could
not
speak
i
fell
on
my
knees
and
prayed
to
god
some
minutes
passed
in
solemn
silence
when
marguerite
suddenly
withdrew
her
hand
with
a
gesture
of
alarm
the
doctor
came
up
hastily
i
rose
mlle
de
porhoët
s
head
had
fallen
back
with
a
fixed
and
radiant
glance
she
looked
towards
heaven
her
lips
and
as
if
she
were
speaking
in
a
dream
she
whispered
god
the
good
god
i
see
him
there
up
there
yes
the

golden
lamps
the
windows
the
sun
everywhere
two
angels
kneeling
before
the
altar
in
white
robes
their
wings
move
god
they
are
alive
this
cry
died
on
her
lips
which
remained
smiling
she
closed
her
eyes
as
if
she
were
going
to
sleep
and
suddenly
an
air
of
immortal
youth
fell
on
her
face
making
it
almost
unrecognisable
to
us

i
felt
her
lips
on
thought
my
soul
was
escaping
from
me

with

desired
to
fill
my

be

alone

pious

yours

two
hours
after

yielding
to

went
down

into

i
had
seen
a
light
the
night
was
profoundly
dark
as
i
approached
the
arbour
at
the
end
of
the
little
inclosure
i
heard
a
faint
sound
and
at
the
same
moment
a
shadowy
form
detached
itself
from
the
foliage
i
felt
a
sudden
rapture
my
heart
leaped
and
i
saw
the
heavens
fill
with
stars
marguerite
i
cried
holding
out
my
arms
i
heard
a
little
cry
then
my
name
murmured
faintly
then
silence

felt
her
lips
on
mine

achieved
by

as
early
as

a
popularity
which
never
waned
to
his
last
hour
it
seems
that
his
life
which
we
should
have
pictured
excessively
brilliant
and
public
was
in
reality
quiet
and
retired
the
author
of

of
the
roman

un

pauvre
was
as
his
portraits
attest
melancholy
of
temperament
and
contemplative
of
mind
a
man
who
was
happiest
in
his
own
study
who
preferred
the
distant
echoes
of
his
literary
triumphs
in
his
home
to

thereof

on

treated
him

it
is
difficult
to
understand
why
an
author
so
honoured

so
much
sought
after
should
have
left
so

was
not

we
find
it
almost
hard

accept
the
fact

me
everything

delicate

cultivated
mind

endless
opportunities

being
painted

he
was
always

nervous

too
busy
to
undertake

proposed
by

is
why
i
can
only
show
you
a
