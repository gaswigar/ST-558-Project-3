the
case
of
the
registered
letter
by
augusta
groner
translated

colbron
introduction
to
joe
muller
joseph
muller
secret
service
detective
of
the
imperial
austrian
police
is
one
of
the
great
experts
in
his
profession
in
personality
he
differs
greatly
from
other
famous
detectives
he
has
neither
the
impressive
authority
of
sherlock
holmes
nor
the
keen
brilliancy
of
monsieur
lecoq
muller
is
a
small
slight
man
of
indefinite
age
and
of
much
humbleness
of
mien
a
naturally
retiring
modest
disposition
and
two
external
causes
are
the
reasons
for
muller
s
humbleness
of
manner
which
is
his
chief
characteristic
one
cause
is
the
fact
that
in
early
youth
a
miscarriage
of
justice
gave
him
several
years
in
prison
an
experience
which
cast
a
stigma
on
his
name
and
which
made
it
impossible
for
him
for
many
years
after
to
obtain
honest
employment
but
the
world
is
richer
and
safer
by
muller
s
early
misfortune
for
it
was
this
experience
which
threw
him
back
on
his
own
peculiar
talents
for
a
livelihood
and
drove
him
into
the
police
force
had
he
been
able
to
enter
any
other
profession
his
genius
might
have
been
stunted
to
a
mere
pastime
instead
of
being
as
now
utilised
for
the
public
good
then
the
red
tape
and
bureaucratic
etiquette
which
attaches
to
every
governmental
department
puts
the
secret
service
men
of
the
imperial
police
on
a
par
with
the
lower
ranks
of
the
subordinates
muller
s
official
rank
is
scarcely
much
higher
than
that
of
a
policeman
although
kings
and
councillors
consult
him
and
the
police
department
realises
to
the
full
what
a
treasure
it
has
in
him
but
official
red
tape
and
his
early
misfortune
prevent
the
giving
of
any
higher
official
standing
to
even
such
a
genius
born
and
bred
to
such
conditions
muller
understands
them
and
his
natural
modesty
of
disposition
asks
for
no
outward
honours
asks
for
nothing
but
an
income
sufficient
for
his
simple
needs
and
for
aid
and
opportunity
to
occupy
himself
in
the
way
he
most
enjoys
joseph
muller
s
character
is
a
strange
mixture
the
man
in
the
world
he
is
a
human
bloodhound
when
once
the
lure
of
the
trail
has
caught
him
he
scarcely
eats
or
sleeps
when
the
chase
is
on
he
does
not
seem
to
know
human
weakness
nor
fatigue
in
spite
of
his
frail
body
once
put
on
a
case
his
mind
delves
and
delves
until
it
finds
a
clue
then
something
awakes
within
him
a
spirit
akin
to
that
which
holds
the
bloodhound
nose
to
trail
and
he
will
accomplish
the
apparently
impossible
he
will
track
down
his
victim
when
the
entire
machinery
of
a
great
police
department
seems
helpless
to
discover
anything
the
high
chiefs
and
commissioners
grant
a
condescending
permission
when
muller
asks
may
i
do
this
or
may
i
handle
this
case
this
way
both
parties
knowing
all
the
while
that
it
is
a
farce
and
that
the
department
waits
helpless
until
this
humble
little
man
saves
its
honour
by
solving
some
problem
before
which
its
intricate
machinery
has
stood
dazed
and
puzzled
this
call
of
the
trail
is
something
that
is
stronger
than
anything
else
in
muller
s
mentality
and
now
and
then
it
brings
him
into
conflict
with
the
department
or
with
his
own
better
nature
sometimes
his
unerring
instinct
discovers
secrets
in
high
places
secrets
which
the
police
department
is
bidden
to
hush
up
and
leave
untouched
muller
is
then
taken
off
the
case
and
left
idle
for
a
while
if
he
persists
in
his
opinion
as
to
the
true
facts
and
at
other
times
muller
s
own
warm
heart
gets
him
into
trouble
he
will
track
down
his
victim
driven
by
the
power
in
his
soul
which
is
stronger
than
all
volition
but
when
he
has
this
victim
in
the
net
he
will
sometimes
discover
him
to
be
a
much
finer
better
man
than
the
other
individual
whose
wrong
at
this
particular
criminal
s
hand
set
in
motion
the
machinery
of
justice
several
times
that
has
happened
to
muller
and
each
time
his
heart
got
the
better
of
his
professional
instincts
of
his
practical
too
perhaps
at
least
as
far
as
his
own
advancement
was
concerned
and
he
warned
the
victim
defeating
his
own
work
this
peculiarity
of
muller
s
character
caused
his
undoing
at
last
his
official
undoing
that
is
and
compelled
his
retirement
from
the
force
but
his
advice
is
often
sought
unofficially
by
the
department
and
to
those
who
know
muller
s
hand
can
be
seen
in
the
unravelling
of
many
a
famous
case
the
following
stories
are
but
a
few
of
the
many
interesting
cases
that
have
come
within
the
experience
of
this
great
detective
but
they
give
a
fair
portrayal
of
muller
s
peculiar
method
of
working
his
looking
on
himself
as
merely
an
humble
member
of
the
department
and
the
comedy
of
his
acting
under
official
orders
when
the
department
is
in
reality
following
out
his
directions
the
case
of
the
registered
letter
oh
sir
save
him
if
you
can
save
my
poor
nephew
i
know
he
is
innocent
the
little
old
lady
sank
back
in
her
chair
gazing
up
at
commissioner
von
riedau
with
eyes
full
of
helpless
appeal
the
commissioner
looked
thoughtful
but
the
case
is
in
the
hands
of
the
local
authorities
madam
he
answered
gently
a
strain
of
pity
in
his
voice
i
don
t
exactly
see
how
we
could
but
they
believe
albert
guilty
they
haven
t
given
him
a
chance
he
can
not
be
sentenced
without
sufficient
proof
of
his
but
the
trial
the
horrible
trial
it
will
kill
him
his
heart
is
weak
i
thought
i
thought
you
might
send
some
one
some
one
of
your
detectives
to
find
out
the
truth
of
the
case
you
must
have
the
best
people
here
in
vienna
oh
my
poor
albert
her
voice
died
away
in
a
suppressed
sob
and
she
covered
her
face
to
keep
back
the
tears
the
commissioner
pressed
a
bell
on
his
desk
is
detective
joseph
muller
anywhere
about
the
building
he
asked
of
the
attendant
who
appeared
at
the
door
i
think
he
is
sir
i
saw
him
come
in
not
long
ask
him
to
come
up
to
this
room
say
i
would
like
to
speak
to
the
attendant
went
out
i
have
sent
for
one
of
the
best
men
on
our
force
madam
continued
the
commissioner
turning
back
to
the
pathetic
little
figure
in
the
chair
we
will
go
into
this
matter
a
little
more
in
detail
and
see
if
it
is
possible
for
us
to
interfere
with
the
work
of
the
local
authorities
in
g
the
little
old
lady
gave
her
eyes
a
last
hasty
dab
with
a
dainty
handkerchief
and
raised
her
head
again
fighting
for
she
was
a
quaint
little
figure
with
soft
grey
hair
drawn
back
smoothly
from
a
face
in
which
each
wrinkle
seemed
the
seal
of
some
loving
thought
for
others
her
bonnet
and
gown
were
of
excellent
material
in
delicate
soft
colours
but
cut
in
the
style
of
an
earlier
decade
the
capable
lines
of
her
thin
little
hands
showed
through
the
fabric
of
her
grey
gloves
her
whole
attitude
bore
the
impress
of
one
who
had
adventured
far
beyond
the
customary
routine
of
her
home
circle
adventured
out
into
the
world
in
fear
and
trembling
impelled
by
the
stress
of
a
great
love
a
knock
was
heard
at
the
door
and
a
small
slight
man
with
a
kind
face
entered
at
the
commissioner
s
call
you
sent
for
me
sir
he
asked
yes
muller
there
is
a
matter
here
in
which
i
need
your
advice
your
assistance
perhaps
this
is
detective
muller
miss
the
commissioner
picked
up
the
card
on
his
desk
miss
graumann
if
you
will
tell
us
now
more
in
detail
all
that
you
can
tell
us
about
this
case
we
may
be
able
to
help
oh
if
you
would
murmured
miss
graumann
with
something
more
of
hope
in
her
voice
the
expression
of
sympathetic
interest
on
the
face
of
the
newcomer
had
already
won
her
confidence
for
him
her
slight
figure
straightened
up
in
the
chair
and
the
two
men
sat
down
opposite
her
prepared
to
listen
to
her
story
i
will
tell
you
all
i
know
and
understand
about
this
matter
gentlemen
she
began
my
name
is
babette
graumann
and
i
live
with
my
nephew
albert
graumann
engineering
expert
in
the
village
of
grunau
which
is
not
far
from
the
city
of
g
my
nephew
albert
the
dearest
truest
sobs
threatened
to
overcome
her
again
but
she
mastered
them
bravely
albert
is
now
in
prison
accused
of
the
murder
of
his
friend
john
siders
in
the
latter
s
lodgings
in
g
yes
that
is
the
gist
of
what
you
have
already
told
me
said
the
commissioner
muller
miss
graumann
believes
her
nephew
innocent
contrary
to
the
opinion
of
the
local
authorities
in
g
she
has
come
to
ask
for
some
one
from
here
who
could
ferret
out
the
truth
of
this
matter
you
are
free
now
and
if
we
find
that
it
can
be
done
without
offending
the
local
authorities
who
is
the
commissioner
in
charge
of
the
case
in
g
asked
muller
commissioner
lange
is
his
name
i
believe
replied
miss
graumann
h
m
muller
and
the
commissioner
exchanged
glances
i
think
we
can
venture
to
hear
more
of
this
said
the
commissioner
as
if
in
answer
to
their
unspoken
thought
can
you
give
us
the
details
now
madam
who
is
or
rather
who
was
this
john
siders
john
siders
came
to
our
village
a
little
over
a
year
ago
continued
miss
graumann
he
came
from
chicago
he
told
us
although
he
was
evidently
a
german
by
birth
he
bought
a
nice
little
piece
of
property
not
far
from
our
home
and
settled
down
there
he
was
a
quiet
man
and
made
few
friends
but
he
seemed
to
take
to
albert
and
came
to
see
us
frequently
albert
had
spent
some
years
in
america
in
chicago
and
siders
liked
to
talk
to
him
about
things
and
people
there
but
one
day
siders
suddenly
sold
his
property
and
moved
to
g
two
weeks
later
he
was
found
dead
in
his
lodgings
in
the
city
murdered
and
now
now
they
have
accused
albert
of
the
on
what
grounds
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
i
did
not
mean
that
s
all
right
muller
said
the
commissioner
as
you
may
have
to
undertake
the
case
you
might
as
well
begin
to
do
the
questioning
they
say
miss
graumann
s
voice
quavered
they
say
that
albert
was
the
last
person
known
to
have
been
in
siders
room
they
say
that
it
was
his
revolver
found
in
the
room
that
is
the
dreadful
part
of
it
it
was
his
revolver
he
acknowledges
it
but
he
did
not
know
until
the
police
showed
it
to
him
that
the
weapon
was
not
in
its
usual
place
in
his
study
they
tell
me
that
everything
speaks
for
his
guilt
but
i
can
not
believe
it
i
can
not
he
says
he
is
innocent
in
spite
of
everything
i
believe
him
i
brought
him
up
sir
i
was
like
his
own
mother
to
him
he
never
knew
any
other
mother
he
never
lied
to
me
not
once
when
he
was
a
little
boy
and
i
don
t
believe
he
d
lie
to
me
now
now
that
he
s
a
man
of
he
says
he
did
not
kill
john
siders
oh
i
know
even
without
his
saying
it
that
he
would
not
do
such
a
can
you
tell
us
anything
more
about
the
murder
itself
questioned
muller
gently
is
there
any
possibility
of
suicide
or
was
there
a
robbery
they
say
it
was
no
suicide
sir
and
that
there
was
a
large
sum
of
money
missing
but
why
should
albert
take
any
one
else
s
money
he
has
money
of
his
own
and
he
earns
a
good
income
besides
we
have
all
that
we
need
oh
it
is
some
dreadful
mistake
there
is
the
newspaper
account
of
the
discovery
of
the
body
perhaps
muller
might
like
to
read
she
pointed
to
a
sheet
of
newspaper
on
the
desk
the
commissioner
handed
it
to
muller
it
was
an
evening
paper
dated
g
september
and
it
gave
an
elaborate
account
in
provincial
journalese
of
the
discovery
that
morning
of
the
body
of
john
siders
evidently
murdered
in
his
lodgings
the
main
facts
to
be
gathered
from
the
story
were
as
follows
john
siders
had
rented
the
rooms
in
which
he
met
his
death
about
ten
days
before
paying
a
month
s
rent
in
advance
the
lodgings
consisted
of
two
rooms
in
a
little
house
in
a
quiet
street
it
was
a
street
of
simple
one
and
two
family
dwellings
occupied
by
artisans
and
small
tradespeople
there
were
many
open
spaces
gardens
and
vacant
lots
in
the
street
the
house
in
which
siders
lodged
belonged
to
a
travelling
salesman
by
the
name
of
winter
the
man
was
away
from
home
a
great
deal
and
his
wife
with
her
child
and
an
old
servant
lived
in
the
lower
part
of
the
house
while
the
rooms
occupied
by
siders
were
in
the
upper
story
siders
lived
very
quietly
going
out
frequently
in
the
afternoon
but
returning
early
in
the
evening
he
had
said
to
his
landlady
that
he
had
many
friends
in
g
but
during
the
time
of
his
stay
in
the
house
he
had
had
but
one
caller
a
gentleman
who
came
on
the
evening
of
the
of
september
the
old
maid
had
opened
the
door
for
him
and
showed
him
to
siders
rooms
she
described
this
visitor
as
having
a
full
black
beard
and
wearing
a
grey
felt
hat
nobody
saw
the
man
go
out
for
the
old
maid
the
only
person
in
the
house
at
the
time
had
retired
early
winter
and
her
little
girl
were
spending
the
night
with
the
former
s
mother
in
a
distant
part
of
the
city
the
next
morning
the
old
servant
taking
the
lodger
s
coffee
up
to
him
at
the
usual
hour
found
him
dead
on
the
floor
of
his
shot
through
the
heart
the
woman
ran
screaming
from
the
house
and
alarmed
the
neighbours
a
policeman
at
the
corner
heard
the
noise
and
led
the
crowd
up
to
the
room
where
the
dead
man
lay
it
was
plain
to
be
seen
that
this
was
not
a
case
of
suicide
everywhere
were
signs
of
a
terrible
struggle
the
furniture
was
overturned
the
and
the
cupboard
were
open
and
their
contents
scattered
on
the
floor
one
of
the
window
curtains
was
torn
into
strips
as
if
the
victim
had
been
trying
to
escape
by
way
of
the
window
but
had
been
dragged
back
into
the
room
by
his
murderer
an
overturned
ink
bottle
on
the
table
had
spattered
wide
and
added
to
the
general
confusion
in
the
midst
of
the
disorder
lay
the
body
of
the
murdered
man
now
cold
in
the
rigour
of
death
the
police
commissioner
arrived
soon
took
possession
of
the
rooms
and
made
a
thorough
examination
of
the
premises
a
letter
found
on
the
desk
gave
another
proof
if
such
were
needed
that
this
was
not
a
case
of
suicide
this
letter
was
in
the
handwriting
of
the
dead
man
and
read
as
follows
dear
friend
i
appreciate
greatly
all
the
kindness
shown
me
by
yourself
and
your
good
wife
i
have
been
more
successful
than
i
thought
possible
in
overcoming
the
obstacles
you
know
of
therefore
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
join
you
day
after
sunday
in
the
proposed
excursion
i
will
call
for
you
at
the
cab
and
the
champagne

be
my
share
of
the
trip

ll
have
a
jolly
day
and
drink
a
glass
or
two
to
our
plans
for
the
future
with
best
greetings
for
both
of
you
your
old
friend
john
g
friday
an
envelope
not
yet
addressed
lay
beside
this
letter
it
was
clear
that
the
man
who
penned
these
words
had
no
thought
of
suicide
on
the
contrary
he
was
looking
forward
to
a
day
of
pleasure
in
the
near
future
and
laying
plans
for
the
time
to
come
the
murderer
s
bullet
had
pierced
a
heart
pulsing
with
the
joy
of
life
this
was
the
gist
of
the
account
in
the
evening
paper
muller
read
it
through
carefully
lingering
over
several
points
which
seemed
to
interest
him
particularly
then
he
turned
to
miss
babette
graumann
and
then
what
happened
he
asked
then
the
police
commissioner
came
to
grunau
and
questioned
my
nephew
they
had
found
out
that
albert
was
siders
only
friend
here
and
late
that
evening
the
mayor
and
the
commissioner
came
to
our
house
with
the
revolver
they
had
found
in
the
room
in
g
and
they
they
her
voice
trembled
again
they
arrested
my
dear
boy
and
took
him
have
you
visited
him
in
prison
what
does
he
say
about
it
himself
he
seems
quite
hopeless
he
says
that
he
is
innocent
oh
i
know
he
is
but
everything
is
against
him
he
acknowledges
that
it
was
he
who
was
in
siders
room
the
evening
before
the
murder
he
went
there
because
siders
wrote
him
to
come
he
says
he
left
early
and
that
john
acted
queerly
he
knows
they
will
not
believe
his
story
this
worry
and
anxiety
will
kill
him
he
has
a
serious
heart
trouble
he
has
suffered
from
it
for
years
and
it
has
been
growing
steadily
worse
i
dare
not
think
what
this
excitement
may
do
for
miss
graumann
broke
down
again
and
sobbed
aloud
muller
laid
his
hands
soothingly
on
the
little
old
fingers
that
gripped
the
arm
of
the
chair
did
your
nephew
send
you
here
to
ask
for
help
he
inquired
very
gently
oh
no
the
old
lady
looked
up
at
him
through
her
tears
no
he
would
not
have
done
that
i
m
afraid
that
he
ll
be
angry
if
he
knows
that
i
have
come
he
seemed
so
hopeless
so
dazed
i
just
couldn
t
stand
it
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
police
in
g
were
taking
things
for
granted
and
just
sitting
there
waiting
for
an
innocent
man
to
confess
instead
of
looking
for
the
real
murderer
who
may
be
gone
the
lord
knows
where
by
now
miss
graumann
s
faded
cheeks
flushed
a
delicate
pink
and
she
straightened
up
in
her
chair
again
while
her
eyes
snapped
defiance
through
the
tears
that
hung
on
their
lashes
a
faint
gleam
twinkled
up
in
muller
s
eyes
and
he
did
not
look
at
his
chief
doctor
von
riedau
s
own
face
glowed
in
a
slowly
mounting
flush
and
his
eyes
drooped
in
a
moment
of
conscious
embarrassment
at
some
recollection
the
sting
of
which
was
evidently
made
worse
by
muller
s
presence
but
commissioner
von
riedau
had
brains
enough
to
acknowledge
his
mistakes
and
to
learn
from
them
he
looked
across
the
desk
at
miss
graumann
you
are
right
madam
the
police
have
made
that
mistake
more
than
once
and
a
man
with
a
clear
record
deserves
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
we
will
take
up
this
case
detective
muller
will
be
put
in
charge
of
it
and
that
means
madam
that
we
are
giving
you
the
very
best
assistance
the
imperial
police
force
miss
babette
graumann
did
not
attempt
to
speak
in
a
wave
of
emotion
she
stretched
out
both
little
hands
to
the
detective
and
clasped
his
warmly
oh
thank
you
she
said
at
last
i
thank
you
he
s
just
like
my
own
boy
to
me
he
s
all
the
child
i
ever
had
you
but
there
are
difficulties
in
the
way
continued
the
commissioner
in
a
tone
the
local
authorities
in
g
have
not
asked
for
our
assistance
and
we
are
taking
up
the
case
over
their
heads
as
it
were
i
shall
have
to
leave
that
to
muller
s
diplomacy
he
will
come
to
g
and
have
an
interview
with
your
nephew
then
he
will
have
to
use
his
own
judgment
as
to
the
next
steps
and
as
to
how
far
he
may
go
in
opposition
to
what
has
been
done
by
the
police
and
then
i
may
go
back
home
asked
miss
graumann
go
home
with
the
assurance
that
you
will
help
my
poor
boy
yes
you
may
depend
on
us
madam
is
there
anything
we
can
do
for
you
here
are
you
alone
in
the
city
no
thank
you
there
is
a
friend
here
who
will
take
care
of
me
she
will
put
me
on
the
afternoon
express
back
to
g
it
is
very
likely
that
i
will
take
that
train
myself
said
muller
if
there
is
anything
that
you
need
on
the
journey
call
on
oh
thank
you
i
will
indeed
thank
you
both
gentlemen
and
now
and
god
bless
you
the
commissioner
bowed
and
muller
held
the
door
open
for
miss
graumann
to
pass
out
there
was
silence
in
the
room
as
the
two
men
looked
after
the
quaint
little
figure
slowly
descending
the
stairs
a
brave
little
woman
murmured
the
commissioner
it
is
not
only
the
mother
in
the
flesh
who
knows
what
a
mother
s
love
is
added
muller
next
morning
joseph
muller
stood
in
the
cell
of
the
prison
in
g
confronting
albert
graumann
accused
of
the
murder
of
john
siders
the
detective
had
just
come
from
a
rather
difficult
interview
with
commissioner
lange
but
the
latter
though
not
a
brilliant
man
was
at
least
he
acknowledged
the
right
of
the
accused
and
his
family
to
ask
for
outside
assistance
and
agreed
with
muller
that
it
was
better
to
have
some
one
in
the
official
service
brought
in
rather
than
a
private
detective
whose
work
in
its
eventual
results
might
bring
shame
on
the
police
muller
explained
that
miss
graumann
did
not
want
her
nephew
to
know
that
it
was
she
who
had
asked
for
aid
in
his
behalf
and
that
it
could
only
redound
to
his
lange
s
credit
if
it
were
understood
that
he
had
sent
to
vienna
for
expert
assistance
in
this
case
it
would
be
a
proof
of
his
conscientious
attention
to
duty
and
would
insure
praise
for
him
whichever
way
the
case
turned
out
commissioner
lange
saw
the
force
of
this
argument
and
finally
gave
muller
permission
to
handle
the
case
as
he
thought
best
rather
relieved
than
otherwise
for
his
own
part
the
detective
s
next
errand
was
to
the
prison
where
he
now
stood
looking
up
into
the
dark
eyes
of
a
tall
man
who
had
arisen
from
the
cot
at
his
entrance
albert
graumann
had
a
strong
face
and
bearing
his
natural
expression
was
somewhat
hard
and
stern
but
it
was
the
expression
of
a
man
of
integrity
and
responsibility
muller
had
already
made
some
inquiries
as
to
the
prisoner
s
reputation
and
business
standing
in
the
community
and
all
that
he
had
heard
was
favourable
a
certain
hardness
and
lack
of
amiability
in
graumann
s
nature
made
it
difficult
for
him
to
win
the
hearts
of
others
but
although
he
was
not
generally
loved
he
was
universally
respected
through
the
signs
of
nagging
fear
sorrow
and
printed
clearly
on
the
face
before
him
muller
s
keen
eyes
looked
down
into
the
soul
of
a
man
who
might
be
overbearing
pitiless
even
if
occasion
demanded
but
who
would
not
murder
at
least
not
for
the
sake
of
gain
this
last
possibility
muller
had
dismissed
from
his
mind
even
before
he
saw
the
prisoner
the
man
s
reputation
was
sufficient
to
make
the
thought
ridiculous
but
he
had
not
made
up
his
mind
whether
it
might
not
be
a
case
of
a
murder
after
a
quarrel
now
he
began
to
doubt
even
this
when
he
looked
into
the
intelligent
face
of
the
man
in
the
cell
but
muller
had
the
gift
of
putting
aside
his
own
convictions
when
he
wanted
his
mind
clear
to
consider
evidence
before
him
graumann
had
risen
from
his
sitting
position
when
he
saw
a
stranger
his
heavy
brows
drew
down
over
his
eyes
but
he
waited
for
the
other
to
speak
i
am
detective
joseph
muller
from
vienna
began
the
newcomer
when
he
had
seen
that
the
prisoner
did
not
intend
to
start
the
conversation
have
you
come
to
question
me
again
asked
graumann
wearily
i
can
say
no
more
than
i
have
already
said
to
the
police
commissioner
and
no
amount
of
can
make
me
confess
a
crime
of
which
i
am
not
guilty
no
matter
what
evidence
there
may
be
against
the
prisoner
s
voice
was
hard
and
determined
in
spite
of
its
note
of
physical
and
mental
weariness
i
have
not
come
to
extort
a
confession
from
you
graumann
muller
replied
gently
but
to
help
you
establish
your
innocence
if
it
be
a
wave
of
colour
flooded
the
prisoner
s
cheek
he
gasped
pressed
his
hand
to
his
heart
and
dropped
down
on
his
cot
pardon
me
he
said
finally
hesitating
like
a
man
who
is
fighting
for
breath
my
heart
is
weak
any
excitement
upsets
me
you
mean
that
the
authorities
are
not
convinced
of
my
guilt
in
spite
of
the
evidence
you
mean
that
they
will
give
me
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
that
they
will
give
me
a
chance
for
life
yes
that
is
the
reason
for
my
coming
here
i
am
to
take
this
case
in
hand
if
you
will
talk
freely
to
me
graumann
i
may
be
able
to
help
you
i
have
seen
too
many
mistakes
of
justice
because
of
circumstantial
evidence
to
lay
any
too
great
stress
upon
it
i
have
waited
to
hear
your
side
of
the
story
from
yourself
i
did
not
want
to
hear
it
from
others
will
you
tell
it
to
me
now
no
do
not
move
i
will
get
the
stool
graumaun
sat
back
on
the
cot
his
head
resting
against
the
wall
his
eyes
had
closed
while
muller
was
speaking
but
his
quieter
breathing
showed
that
he
was
mastering
the
physical
attack
which
had
so
shaken
him
at
the
first
glimpse
of
hope
he
opened
his
eyes
now
and
looked
at
muller
steadily
for
a
moment
then
he
said
yes
i
will
tell
you
my
life
and
my
work
have
taught
me
to
gauge
men
i
will
tell
you
everything
i
know
about
this
sad
affair
i
will
tell
you
the
absolute
truth
and
i
think
you
will
believe
i
will
believe
you
said
muller
simply
you
know
the
details
of
the
murder
of
course
and
why
i
was
arrested
you
were
arrested
because
you
were
the
last
person
seen
in
the
company
of
the
murdered
man
exactly
then
i
may
go
back
and
tell
you
something
of
my
connection
with
john
siders
it
would
be
the
very
best
thing
to
i
live
in
grunau
as
you
doubtless
know
and
am
the
engineering
expert
of
large
machine
works
there
my
father
before
me
held
an
important
position
in
the
factory
and
my
family
have
always
lived
in
grunau
i
have
traveled
a
great
deal
myself
i
am
years
old
a
childless
widower
and
live
with
my
old
aunt
miss
babette
graumann
and
my
ward
miss
eleonora
roemer
a
young
lady
of
muller
looked
up
with
a
slight
start
of
surprise
but
did
not
say
anything
graumann
continued
a
little
over
a
year
ago
john
siders
who
signed
himself
as
coming
from
chicago
bought
a
piece
of
property
in
our
town
and
came
to
live
there
i
made
his
acquaintance
in
the
cafe
and
he
seemed
to
take
a
fancy
to
me
i
also
had
spent
several
years
in
chicago
and
we
naturally
came
to
speak
of
the
place
we
discovered
that
we
had
several
mutual
acquaintances
there
and
enjoyed
talking
over
the
old
times
otherwise
i
did
not
take
particularly
to
the
man
and
as
i
came
to
know
him
better
i
noticed
that
he
never
mentioned
that
part
of
his
life
which
lay
back
of
the
years
in
chicago
i
asked
a
casual
question
once
or
twice
as
to
his
home
and
family
but
he
evaded
me
every
time
and
would
not
give
a
direct
answer
he
was
evidently
a
german
by
birth
and
education
a
man
with
university
training
and
one
who
knew
life
thoroughly
he
had
delightful
manners
and
when
he
could
forget
his
shyness
for
a
while
he
could
be
very
agreeable
the
ladies
of
my
family
came
to
like
him
and
encouraged
him
to
call
frequently
then
the
thing
happened
that
i
should
not
have
believed
possible
my
ward
miss
roemer
a
quiet
reserved
girl
fell
in
love
with
this
man
about
whom
none
of
us
knew
anything
a
man
with
a
past
of
which
he
did
not
care
to
speak
i
was
not
in
any
way
satisfied
with
the
match
and
they
seemed
to
realise
it
for
siders
managed
to
persuade
the
girl
to
a
secret
engagement
i
discovered
it
a
month
or
two
ago
and
it
made
me
very
angry
i
did
not
let
them
see
how
badly
i
felt
but
i
warned
lora
not
to
have
too
much
to
do
with
the
boy
and
i
set
about
finding
out
something
regarding
his
earlier
life
it
was
my
duty
to
do
this
as
i
was
the
girl
s
guardian
she
has
no
other
relative
living
and
no
one
to
turn
to
except
my
aunt
and
myself
i
wrote
to
richard
tressider
in
chicago
the
owner
of
the
factory
in
which
i
had
been
employed
while
there
john
had
told
me
that
tressider
had
been
his
client
during
the
four
years
in
which
he
practiced
law
in
chicago
i
received
an
answer
about
the
middle
of
august
tressider
had
been
able
to
find
out
only
that
john
was
born
in
the
town
of
hartberg
in
a
certain
year
this
was
enough
i
took
leave
of
absence
for
a
few
days
and
went
to
hartberg
which
as
you
know
is
about
miles
from
here
three
days
later
i
knew
all
that
i
wanted
to
know
john
siders
was
not
the
man
s
real
name
or
rather
it
was
only
part
of
his
name
his
full
name
was
theodor
john
bellmann
and
his
mother
was
an
englishwoman
whose
maiden
name
was
siders
his
father
was
a
county
official
who
died
at
an
early
age
leaving
his
widow
and
the
boy
in
deepest
poverty
bellmann
moved
to
g
to
give
music
lessons
theodor
went
to
school
there
then
finally
to
college
and
was
an
excellent
pupil
everywhere
but
one
day
it
was
discovered
that
he
had
been
stealing
money
from
the
banker
in
whose
house
he
was
serving
as
private
tutor
to
the
latter
s
sons
a
large
sum
of
money
was
missing
and
every
evidence
pointed
to
young
bellmann
as
the
thief
he
denied
strenuously
that
he
was
guilty
but
the
district
judge
it
was
the
present
prosecuting
attorney
schmidt
in
g
sentenced
him
he
spent
eight
months
in
prison
during
which
time
his
mother
died
of
grief
at
the
disgrace
there
must
have
been
something
good
in
the
boy
for
he
had
never
forgotten
that
it
was
his
guilt
that
struck
down
his
only
relative
the
mother
who
had
worked
so
hard
for
him
he
had
atoned
for
this
crime
of
his
youth
and
during
the
years
that
have
passed
since
then
he
had
been
an
honest
upright
graumann
paused
a
moment
and
pressed
his
hand
to
his
heart
again
his
voice
had
grown
weaker
and
he
breathed
hard
finally
he
continued
i
commanded
my
ward
to
break
off
her
engagement
as
i
could
not
allow
her
to
marry
a
man
who
was
a
freed
convict
siders
sold
his
property
some
few
weeks
after
that
and
moved
to
g
eleonora
acquiesced
in
my
commands
but
she
was
very
unhappy
and
allowed
me
to
see
very
little
of
her
then
came
the
events
of
the
evening
of
september
the
events
which
have
turned
out
so
terribly
i
will
try
to
tell
you
the
story
just
as
it
happened
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
had
seen
nothing
of
john
since
he
left
this
town
he
had
made
several
attempts
before
his
departure
for
g
to
change
my
opinion
and
my
decision
as
to
his
marriage
to
my
ward
but
i
let
him
see
plainly
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
enter
our
family
with
such
a
past
behind
him
he
asserted
his
innocence
of
the
charges
against
him
and
declared
that
he
had
been
unjustly
accused
and
imprisoned
i
am
afraid
that
i
was
hard
towards
him
i
begin
to
understand
now
as
i
never
thought
i
should
what
it
means
to
be
accused
of
crime
i
begin
to
realise
that
it
is
possible
for
every
evidence
to
point
to
a
man
who
is
absolutely
innocent
of
the
deed
in
question
i
begin
to
think
now
that
john
may
have
been
right
that
possibly
he
also
may
have
been
accused
and
sentenced
on
circumstantial
evidence
alone
i
have
thought
much
and
i
have
learned
much
in
these
terrible
the
prisoner
paused
again
and
sat
brooding
his
eyes
looking
out
into
space
muller
respected
his
suffering
and
sat
in
equal
silence
until
graumann
raised
his
eyes
to
his
again
then
came
the
evening
of
the
of
september
yes
that
evening
it
s
all
like
a
dream
to
graumann
began
again
john
wrote
me
a
letter
asking
me
to
come
to
see
him
on
that
evening
i
tore
up
the
letter
and
threw
it
away
or
perhaps
yes
i
remember
now
i
did
not
wish
eleonora
to
see
that
he
had
written
me
he
asked
me
to
come
to
see
him
as
he
had
something
to
say
to
me
something
of
the
greatest
importance
for
us
both
he
asked
me
not
to
mention
to
any
one
that
i
was
to
see
him
as
it
would
be
wiser
no
one
should
know
that
we
were
still
in
communication
with
each
other
there
was
a
strain
of
nervous
excitement
visible
in
his
letter
i
thought
it
better
to
go
and
see
him
as
he
requested
i
felt
that
i
owed
him
some
little
reparation
for
having
denied
him
the
great
wish
of
his
heart
it
was
my
duty
to
make
up
to
him
in
other
ways
for
what
i
had
felt
obliged
to
do
i
knew
him
for
a
nervous
man
overwrought
by
brooding
for
years
on
what
he
called
his
wrongs
and
i
did
not
know
what
he
might
do
if
i
refused
his
request
it
was
not
of
myself
i
thought
in
this
connection
but
of
the
girl
at
home
who
looked
to
me
for
protection
i
had
no
fear
for
myself
it
never
occurred
to
me
to
think
of
taking
a
weapon
with
me
how
my
revolver
and
it
is
undoubtedly
my
revolver
for
there
was
a
peculiar
break
in
the
silver
ornamentation
on
the
handle
which
is
easily
recognisable
how
this
revolver
of
mine
got
into
his
room
is
more
than
i
can
say
until
the
police
commissioner
showed
it
to
me
two
or
three
days
ago
i
had
no
idea
that
it
was
not
in
the
box
in
my
study
where
it
is
ordinarily
graumann
paused
again
and
looked
about
him
as
if
searching
for
something
he
rose
and
poured
himself
out
a
glass
of
water
let
me
put
some
of
this
in
it
said
muller
it
will
do
you
from
a
flask
in
his
pocket
he
poured
a
few
drops
of
brandy
into
the
water
graumann
drank
it
and
nodded
gratefully
then
he
took
up
his
story
again
i
never
discovered
why
siders
had
sent
for
me
when
i
arrived
at
the
appointed
time
i
found
the
door
of
the
house
closed
i
was
obliged
to
ring
several
times
before
an
old
servant
opened
the
door
she
seemed
surprised
that
it
had
been
locked
she
said
that
the
door
was
always
unlatched
and
that
siders
himself
must
have
closed
it
contrary
to
all
custom
for
she
had
not
done
it
and
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
house
but
the
two
of
them
siders
was
waiting
for
me
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
calling
down
a
noisy
welcome
when
i
asked
him
finally
what
it
was
so
important
that
he
wanted
to
say
to
me
he
evaded
me
and
continued
to
chatter
on
about
commonplace
things
finally
i
insisted
upon
knowing
why
he
had
wanted
me
to
come
and
he
replied
that
the
reason
for
it
had
already
been
fulfilled
that
he
had
nothing
more
to
say
and
that
i
could
go
as
soon
as
i
wanted
to
he
appeared
quite
calm
but
he
must
have
been
very
nervous
for
as
i
stood
by
the
desk
telling
him
what
i
thought
of
his
actions
he
moved
his
hand
hastily
among
the
papers
there
and
upset
the
ink
stand
i
jumped
back
but
not
before
i
had
received
several
large
spots
of
ink
on
my
trousers
he
was
profuse
in
his
apologies
for
the
accident
and
tried
to
take
out
the
spots
with
blotting
paper
then
at
last
when
i
insisted
upon
going
he
looked
out
to
see
whether
there
was
still
a
light
on
the
stairs
and
led
me
down
to
the
door
himself
standing
there
for
some
time
looking
after
me
i
was
slightly
alarmed
as
well
as
angry
at
his
actions
i
believe
that
he
could
not
have
been
quite
in
his
right
mind
that
the
strain
of
nervousness
which
was
apparent
in
his
nature
had
really
made
him
for
i
remember
several
peculiar
incidents
of
my
visit
to
him
one
of
these
was
that
he
almost
insisted
upon
my
taking
away
with
me
ostensibly
to
take
care
of
them
several
valuable
pieces
of
jewelry
which
he
possessed
he
seemed
almost
offended
when
i
refused
to
do
anything
of
the
kind
then
as
i
parted
from
him
at
the
door
not
in
a
very
good
humour
i
will
acknowledge
he
said
to
me
you
will
think
of
me
very
often
in
the
future
more
often
than
you
would
believe
now
this
is
all
the
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
about
my
visit
to
john
siders
on
the
evening
of
september
as
it
had
been
his
wish
i
said
nothing
to
the
ladies
at
home
or
to
any
one
else
about
the
occurrence
and
as
i
have
told
you
i
destroyed
his
letter
asking
me
to
come
to
him
the
following
day
about
noon
the
commissioner
of
police
from
g
called
at
my
office
in
the
factory
and
informed
me
bluntly
that
john
siders
had
been
found
shot
dead
in
his
lodgings
that
morning
i
was
naturally
shocked
as
one
would
be
at
such
news
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
i
had
parted
from
the
man
in
anger
and
that
i
had
no
reason
to
be
particularly
fond
of
him
what
shocked
me
most
of
all
was
the
sudden
thought
that
john
had
taken
his
own
life
it
was
a
perfectly
natural
thought
when
i
considered
his
nervousness
and
his
peculiar
actions
of
the
evening
before
i
believe
i
exclaimed
it
was
a
suicide
almost
without
realising
that
i
was
doing
so
the
commissioner
looked
at
me
sharply
and
said
that
suicide
was
out
of
the
question
that
it
was
an
evident
case
of
murder
he
questioned
me
as
to
siders
affairs
of
which
i
told
only
what
every
one
here
in
the
village
knew
i
did
not
consider
it
incumbent
upon
me
to
disclose
to
the
police
the
disgrace
of
the
man
s
early
life
i
had
been
obliged
to
hurt
him
cruelly
enough
because
of
that
and
i
saw
no
necessity
for
blackening
his
name
now
that
he
was
dead
also
as
according
to
what
the
commissioner
said
it
was
a
case
of
murder
for
robbery
i
did
not
wish
to
go
into
any
details
of
our
connection
with
siders
that
would
cause
the
name
of
my
ward
to
be
mentioned
after
a
few
more
questions
the
commissioner
left
me
i
was
busy
all
the
afternoon
and
did
not
return
to
my
home
until
later
than
usual
i
found
my
aunt
somewhat
worried
because
miss
roemer
had
left
the
house
immediately
after
our
early
dinner
and
had
not
yet
returned
we
both
knew
the
girl
to
be
still
grieving
over
her
broken
engagement
and
we
dreaded
the
effect
this
last
dreadful
news
might
have
on
her
we
supposed
however
that
she
had
gone
to
spend
the
afternoon
with
a
friend
and
were
rather
glad
to
be
spared
the
necessity
of
telling
her
at
once
what
had
happened
i
had
scarcely
finished
my
supper
when
the
door
bell
rang
and
to
my
astonishment
the
mayor
of
grunau
was
announced
accompanied
by
the
same
police
commissioner
who
had
visited
me
in
my
office
that
morning
the
mayor
was
an
old
friend
of
mine
and
his
deeply
grave
face
showed
me
that
something
serious
had
occurred
it
was
indeed
serious
and
for
some
minutes
i
could
not
grasp
the
meaning
of
the
commissioner
s
questions
finally
i
realised
with
a
tremendous
shock
that
i
i
myself
was
under
suspicion
of
the
murder
of
john
siders
the
description
given
by
the
old
servant
of
the
man
who
had
visited
siders
the
evening
before
the
very
clothes
that
i
wore
my
hat
and
the
trousers
spotted
by
the
purple
ink
led
to
my
identification
as
this
mysterious
visitor
the
servant
had
let
me
in
but
she
had
not
seen
me
go
out
then
i
discovered
when
confronted
suddenly
with
my
own
revolver
which
had
been
found
on
the
floor
of
the
room
some
distance
from
the
body
of
the
dead
man
that
this
same
revolver
had
been
identified
as
mine
by
my
ward
eleonora
roemer
who
had
been
to
the
police
station
at
g
in
the
early
afternoon
hours
some
impulse
of
loyalty
to
her
dead
lover
some
foolish
feminine
fear
that
i
might
have
spoken
against
him
in
my
earlier
interviews
with
the
commissioner
had
driven
the
girl
to
this
step
a
few
questions
sufficed
to
draw
from
her
the
story
of
her
secret
engagement
of
its
ending
and
of
my
quarrel
with
john
i
will
say
for
her
that
i
am
certain
she
did
not
realise
that
all
these
things
were
calculated
to
cast
suspicion
on
me
the
poor
girl
is
too
unused
to
the
ways
of
police
courts
to
the
devious
ways
of
the
law
to
realise
what
she
was
doing
the
sight
of
my
revolver
broke
her
down
completely
and
she
acknowledged
that
it
was
mine
that
is
all
except
that
i
was
arrested
and
brought
here
as
you
see
i
told
the
commissioner
the
story
of
my
visit
to
john
siders
exactly
as
i
told
it
to
you
but
it
was
plain
to
be
seen
that
he
did
not
believe
me
it
is
plain
to
be
seen
also
that
he
is
firmly
convinced
of
my
guilt
and
that
he
is
greatly
satisfied
with
himself
at
having
traced
the
criminal
so
and
yet
he
was
not
quite
satisfied
said
muller
gently
you
see
that
he
has
sent
to
the
capital
for
assistance
on
the
muller
felt
this
little
untruth
to
be
justified
for
the
sake
of
the
honour
of
the
police
force
yes
i
m
surprised
at
that
said
graumann
in
his
former
tone
of
weariness
what
do
you
think
you
will
be
able
to
do
about
it
i
must
ask
questions
here
and
there
before
i
can
form
a
plan
of
campaign
replied
muller
what
do
you
think
about
it
yourself
who
do
you
think
killed
siders
how
can
i
know
who
it
was
i
only
know
it
is
not
i
answered
graumann
did
he
have
any
enemies
no
none
that
i
knew
of
and
he
had
few
friends
you
knew
there
was
a
sum
of
money
missing
from
his
rooms
yes
the
sum
they
named
to
me
was
just
about
the
price
that
he
had
received
for
the
sale
of
his
property
here
they
did
me
the
honour
to
believe
that
if
i
had
taken
the
money
at
all
i
had
done
so
merely
as
a
blind
at
least
they
did
not
take
me
for
a
thief
as
well
as
a
murderer
if
the
money
is
really
missing
it
was
for
its
sake
he
was
murdered
i
yes
that
would
be
natural
said
muller
and
you
know
nothing
of
any
other
relations
or
connections
that
the
man
may
have
had
anything
that
might
give
us
a
clue
to
the
truth
no
nothing
he
stood
so
alone
here
as
far
as
i
knew
of
course
as
i
told
you
his
actions
of
the
evening
before
having
been
so
peculiar
and
as
i
knew
that
he
was
not
in
the
happiest
frame
of
mind
i
naturally
thought
of
suicide
at
once
when
they
told
me
that
he
had
been
found
shot
dead
then
they
told
me
that
the
appearance
of
the
room
and
many
other
things
proved
suicide
to
have
been
out
of
the
question
i
know
nothing
more
about
it
i
can
not
think
any
more
about
it
i
know
only
that
i
am
here
in
danger
of
being
sentenced
for
the
crime
that
i
never
committed
that
is
enough
to
keep
any
man
s
mind
he
leaned
back
with
an
intense
fatigue
in
every
line
of
his
face
and
figure
muller
rose
from
his
seat
i
am
afraid
i
have
tired
you
graumann
he
said
but
it
was
necessary
that
i
should
know
all
that
you
had
to
tell
me
try
and
rest
a
little
now
and
meanwhile
be
assured
that
i
am
doing
all
i
can
to
find
out
the
truth
of
this
matter
as
far
as
i
can
tell
now
i
do
not
believe
that
you
have
killed
john
siders
but
i
must
find
some
further
proofs
that
will
convince
others
as
well
as
myself
if
it
is
of
any
comfort
to
you
i
can
tell
you
that
during
a
long
career
as
police
detective
i
have
been
most
astonishingly
fortunate
in
the
cases
i
have
undertaken
i
am
hoping
that
my
usual
good
luck
will
follow
me
here
also
i
am
hoping
it
for
your
the
man
on
the
cot
took
the
hand
the
detective
offered
him
and
pressed
it
firmly
you
will
let
me
know
as
soon
as
you
have
found
anything
anything
that
gives
me
hope
i
will
indeed
and
now
save
your
strength
and
do
not
worry
i
will
help
you
if
it
is
in
my
after
leaving
the
prison
muller
took
the
train
for
the
village
of
grunau
about
half
an
hour
distant
from
the
city
he
found
his
way
easily
to
graumann
s
home
an
attractive
old
house
set
in
a
large
garden
amid
groups
of
beautiful
old
trees
when
he
sent
up
his
card
to
miss
graumann
the
old
lady
tripped
down
stairs
in
a
flutter
of
excitement
did
you
see
him
she
asked
you
have
been
to
the
prison
what
do
you
think
how
does
he
seem
he
seems
calm
replied
muller
although
the
confinement
and
the
anxiety
are
evidently
wearing
on
and
you
heard
his
story
and
you
believe
him
innocent
i
am
inclined
to
do
so
but
there
is
more
yet
for
me
to
investigate
in
this
matter
it
is
certainly
not
as
simple
as
the
police
here
seem
to
believe
may
i
speak
to
your
ward
miss
roemer
she
is
at
home
now
yes
lora
is
at
home
if
you
will
wait
here
a
moment
i
will
send
her
muller
paced
up
and
down
the
large
sunny
room
casting
a
glance
over
the
handsome
old
pieces
of
furniture
and
the
family
portraits
on
the
wall
it
was
evidently
the
home
of
generations
of
people
the
narrow
circle
of
whose
life
was
made
rich
by
congenial
duties
and
a
comfortable
feeling
of
their
standing
in
the
community
while
he
was
studying
one
of
the
portraits
more
carefully
he
became
aware
that
there
was
some
one
in
the
room
he
turned
and
saw
a
tall
blond
girl
standing
by
the
door
she
had
entered
so
softly
that
even
muller
s
quick
ear
had
not
heard
the
opening
of
the
door
do
you
wish
to
speak
to
me
she
said
coming
down
into
the
room
i
am
eleonora
roemer
her
face
which
could
be
called
handsome
in
its
even
regularity
of
feature
and
delicate
skin
was
very
pale
now
and
around
her
eyes
were
dark
rings
that
spoke
of
sleepless
nights
grief
and
mental
shock
were
preying
upon
this
girl
s
mind
she
is
not
the
one
to
make
a
confidant
of
those
around
her
thought
muller
to
himself
then
he
added
aloud
if
it
does
not
distress
you
too
much
to
talk
about
this
sad
affair
i
will
be
very
grateful
if
you
will
answer
a
few
i
will
tell
you
whatever
i
can
said
the
girl
in
the
same
low
even
tone
in
which
she
had
first
spoken
miss
graumann
tells
me
that
you
have
come
from
vienna
to
take
up
this
case
it
is
only
natural
that
we
should
want
to
give
you
every
assistance
in
our
what
is
your
opinion
about
it
was
muller
s
next
remark
made
rather
suddenly
after
a
moment
s
pause
the
directness
of
the
question
seemed
to
shake
the
girl
out
of
her
enforced
calm
a
slow
flush
mounted
into
her
pale
cheeks
and
then
died
away
again
leaving
them
whiter
than
before
i
do
not
know
oh
i
do
not
know
what
to
but
you
do
not
think
graumann
capable
of
such
a
crime
do
you
not
of
the
robbery
of
course
not
that
would
be
absurd
but
has
it
been
clearly
proven
that
there
is
a
robbery
might
it
not
have
been
might
they
not
have
you
mean
might
they
not
have
quarreled
of
course
there
is
that
possibility
and
that
is
why
i
wanted
to
speak
to
you
you
are
the
one
person
who
could
possibly
throw
light
on
this
subject
was
there
any
other
reason
beyond
the
dead
man
s
past
that
would
render
your
guardian
unwilling
to
have
you
marry
him
again
the
slow
flush
mounted
to
eleonora
roemer
s
cheeks
and
her
head
drooped
i
fear
it
may
be
painful
for
you
to
answer
this
said
muller
gently
and
yet
i
must
insist
on
it
in
the
interest
of
he
my
guardian
wished
to
marry
me
himself
the
girl
s
words
came
slowly
and
painfully
muller
drew
in
his
breath
so
sharply
that
it
was
almost
like
a
whistle
he
did
not
tell
me
that
it
might
make
a
that
that
is
what
i
fear
said
the
girl
her
eyes
looking
keenly
into
those
of
the
man
who
sat
opposite
and
then
it
was
his
then
you
do
believe
him
guilty
it
would
be
horrible
horrible
and
yet
i
do
not
know
what
to
there
was
silence
in
the
room
for
a
moment
miss
roemer
s
head
drooped
again
and
her
hands
twisted
nervously
in
her
lap
muller
s
brain
was
very
busy
with
this
new
phase
of
the
problem
finally
he
spoke
let
us
dismiss
this
side
of
the
question
and
talk
of
another
phase
of
it
a
phase
of
which
it
is
necessary
for
me
to
know
something
you
would
naturally
be
the
person
nearest
the
dead
man
the
one
the
only
one
perhaps
to
whom
he
had
given
his
confidence
do
you
know
of
any
enemies
he
might
have
had
in
the
city
no
i
do
not
know
of
any
enemies
or
even
of
any
friends
he
had
there
when
the
terrible
thing
happened
that
clouded
his
past
when
he
had
regained
his
freedom
after
his
term
of
imprisonment
there
was
no
one
left
whom
he
cared
to
see
again
he
does
not
seem
to
have
borne
any
malice
towards
the
banker
who
accused
him
of
the
theft
the
evidence
was
so
strong
against
him
that
he
felt
the
suspicion
was
justified
but
there
was
hatred
in
his
heart
for
one
man
for
the
justice
who
sentenced
him
justice
schmidt
who
is
now
attorney
general
in
g
the
man
who
in
the
name
of
the
state
will
conduct
this
case
asked
muller
quickly
yes
i
believe
it
is
so
is
it
not
an
irony
that
this
man
the
only
one
whom
john
really
hated
should
be
the
one
to
avenge
him
now
h
m
yes
but
did
you
know
of
any
friends
in
g
no
none
at
no
friends
whom
he
might
have
made
while
he
was
in
america
and
then
met
again
in
germany
no
he
never
spoke
of
any
such
to
me
he
told
me
that
he
made
few
friends
he
did
not
seek
them
for
he
was
afraid
that
they
might
find
out
what
had
happened
and
turn
from
him
he
was
morbidly
sensitive
and
could
not
bear
the
why
did
he
return
to
germany
he
was
lonely
and
wanted
to
come
home
again
he
had
made
money
in
america
john
was
very
clever
and
highly
educated
but
his
heart
longed
for
his
own
tongue
and
his
own
muller
took
a
folded
piece
of
paper
from
his
pocket
do
you
know
this
handwriting
miss
roemer
read
the
few
lines
hastily
and
her
voice
trembled
as
she
said
this
is
john
s
handwriting
i
know
it
well
this
is
the
letter
that
was
found
on
the
table
yes
this
letter
appears
to
be
the
last
he
had
written
in
life
do
you
know
to
whom
it
could
have
been
written
the
envelope
as
i
suppose
you
know
from
the
newspaper
reports
was
not
addressed
do
you
know
of
any
friends
with
whom
he
could
have
been
on
terms
of
sufficient
intimacy
to
write
such
a
letter
do
you
know
what
these
plans
for
the
future
could
have
been
it
would
certainly
be
natural
that
he
should
have
spoken
to
you
first
about
no
i
can
not
understand
this
letter
at
all
replied
the
girl
i
have
thought
of
it
frequently
these
terrible
days
i
have
wondered
why
it
was
that
if
he
had
friends
in
the
city
he
did
not
speak
to
me
of
them
he
repeatedly
told
me
that
he
had
no
friends
there
at
all
that
his
life
should
begin
anew
after
we
were
and
did
he
have
any
particular
plans
in
a
business
way
perhaps
no
he
had
a
comfortable
little
income
and
need
have
no
fear
for
the
future
john
was
of
course
too
young
a
man
to
settle
down
and
do
nothing
but
the
only
definite
plans
he
had
made
were
that
we
should
travel
a
little
at
first
and
then
he
would
look
about
him
for
a
congenial
occupation
i
always
thought
it
likely
he
would
resume
a
law
practice
somewhere
i
can
not
understand
in
the
slightest
what
the
plans
are
to
which
the
letter
and
do
you
think
from
what
you
know
of
his
state
of
mind
when
you
saw
him
last
that
he
would
be
likely
so
soon
to
be
planning
pleasures
like
this
no
no
indeed
john
was
terribly
crushed
when
my
guardian
insisted
on
breaking
off
our
engagement
until
my
birthday
i
am
still
bound
to
do
as
my
guardian
says
you
know
john
s
life
and
early
misfortune
made
him
as
i
have
already
said
morbidly
sensitive
and
the
thought
that
it
would
be
a
bar
to
anything
we
might
plan
in
the
future
had
rendered
him
so
depressed
that
and
it
was
not
the
least
of
my
anxieties
and
my
troubles
that
i
feared
i
feared
anything
might
you
feared
he
might
take
his
own
life
do
you
mean
yes
yes
that
is
what
i
feared
but
is
it
not
terrible
to
think
that
he
should
have
died
this
way
by
the
hand
of
a
murderer
h
m
and
you
can
not
remember
any
possible
friend
he
may
have
found
some
schoolboy
friend
of
his
youth
perhaps
with
whom
he
had
again
struck
up
an
oh
no
no
i
am
positive
of
that
john
could
not
bear
to
hear
the
names
even
of
the
people
he
had
known
before
his
misfortune
still
i
do
remember
his
once
having
spoken
of
a
man
a
german
he
had
met
in
chicago
and
rather
taken
a
fancy
to
and
who
had
also
returned
to
could
this
possibly
have
been
the
man
to
whom
the
letter
is
addressed
no
no
this
friend
of
john
s
was
not
married
i
remember
his
saying
that
and
he
lived
in
germany
somewhere
let
me
think
yes
in
and
do
you
remember
the
man
s
name
no
i
can
not
i
am
sorry
to
say
john
only
mentioned
it
once
it
was
only
by
a
great
effort
that
i
could
remember
the
incident
at
and
has
it
not
struck
you
as
rather
peculiar
that
this
friend
the
one
to
whom
the
cordial
letter
was
addressed
did
not
come
forward
and
make
his
identity
known
g
is
a
city
it
is
true
but
it
is
not
a
very
large
city
and
any
man
being
on
terms
of
intimate
acquaintance
with
one
who
was
murdered
would
be
apt
to
come
forward
in
the
hope
of
throwing
some
light
on
the
why
yes
i
had
not
thought
of
that
it
is
peculiar
is
it
not
but
some
people
are
so
foolishly
afraid
of
having
anything
to
do
with
the
police
you
that
is
very
true
miss
roemer
still
it
is
a
queer
incident
and
something
that
i
must
look
what
do
you
believe
asked
the
girl
tensely
i
am
not
in
a
position
to
say
as
yet
when
i
am
i
will
come
to
you
and
tell
then
you
do
not
think
that
my
guardian
killed
john
that
there
was
a
quarrel
between
the
men
there
is
of
course
a
possibility
that
it
may
have
been
so
you
know
your
guardian
better
than
i
do
naturally
our
knowledge
of
a
man
s
character
is
often
a
far
better
guide
than
any
circumstantial
my
guardian
is
a
man
of
the
greatest
uprightness
of
character
but
he
can
be
very
hard
and
pitiless
sometimes
and
he
has
a
violent
temper
which
his
weak
heart
has
forced
him
to
keep
in
control
of
late
all
this
speaks
for
the
possibility
that
there
may
have
been
a
quarrel
ending
in
the
fatal
shot
but
what
i
want
to
know
from
you
is
this
do
you
think
it
possible
that
this
having
happened
albert
graumann
would
not
have
been
the
first
to
confess
his
unpremeditated
crime
is
not
this
the
most
likely
thing
for
a
man
of
his
character
to
do
would
he
so
stubbornly
deny
it
if
it
had
happened
the
girl
started
i
had
not
thought
of
that
why
why
of
course
he
might
have
killed
john
in
a
moment
of
temper
but
he
was
never
a
man
to
conceal
a
fault
he
is
as
pitiless
towards
his
own
weakness
as
towards
that
of
others
you
are
right
oh
you
must
be
right
oh
if
you
could
take
this
awful
fear
from
my
heart
even
my
grief
for
john
would
be
easier
to
bear
muller
rose
from
his
chair
i
think
i
can
promise
you
that
this
load
will
be
lifted
from
your
heart
miss
then
you
believe
that
it
was
just
a
case
of
murder
for
robbery
for
the
money
and
john
had
some
valuable
jewelry
i
know
i
do
not
know
yet
replied
muller
slowly
but
i
will
find
out
i
generally
oh
to
think
that
i
should
have
done
that
poor
man
such
an
injustice
it
is
terrible
terrible
this
house
has
been
ghastly
these
days
his
poor
aunt
knows
that
he
is
innocent
she
could
never
believe
otherwise
she
has
felt
the
hideous
suspicion
in
my
mind
it
has
made
her
suffering
worse
will
they
ever
forgive
me
her
joy
if
i
can
free
her
nephew
will
make
her
forget
everything
go
to
her
now
miss
roemer
comfort
her
with
the
assurance
that
you
also
believe
him
to
be
innocent
i
must
hasten
back
to
g
and
go
on
with
this
the
girl
stood
at
the
doorway
shaded
by
the
overhanging
branches
of
two
great
trees
looking
down
the
street
after
the
slight
figure
of
the
detective
oh
it
is
all
easier
to
hear
hard
as
it
is
easier
now
that
this
horrible
suspicion
has
gone
from
my
mind
why
did
i
not
think
of
that
before
alone
in
the
corner
of
the
smoking
compartment
in
the
train
to
g
muller
arranged
in
his
mind
the
facts
he
had
already
gathered
he
had
questioned
the
servants
of
john
siders
former
household
had
found
that
the
dead
man
received
very
few
letters
only
an
occasional
business
communication
from
his
bank
of
the
few
others
the
servants
knew
nothing
except
that
he
had
always
thrown
the
envelopes
carelessly
in
the
waste
paper
basket
and
had
never
seemed
to
have
any
correspondence
which
he
cared
to
conceal
no
friend
from
elsewhere
had
ever
visited
him
in
grunau
and
he
had
made
few
friends
there
except
the
graumann
family
the
facts
of
the
case
as
he
knew
them
now
were
such
as
to
make
it
extremely
doubtful
that
graumann
was
the
murderer
muller
himself
had
been
inclined
to
believe
in
the
possibility
of
a
quarrel
between
the
two
men
particularly
when
he
had
heard
that
graumann
himself
was
in
love
with
his
handsome
ward
but
the
second
thought
that
came
to
him
then
impelled
by
the
unerring
instinct
that
so
often
guided
him
to
the
truth
was
the
assurance
that
in
a
case
of
this
kind
in
a
case
of
a
quarrel
terminating
fatally
a
man
like
albert
graumann
would
be
the
very
first
to
give
himself
up
to
the
police
and
to
tell
the
facts
of
the
case
albert
graumann
was
a
man
of
honour
and
unimpeachable
integrity
such
a
man
would
not
persist
in
a
foolish
denial
of
the
deed
which
he
had
committed
in
a
moment
of
temper
there
would
be
nothing
to
gain
from
it
and
his
own
conscience
would
be
his
severest
judge
the
disorder
in
the
room
thought
muller
it
ll
be
too
late
for
that
now
i
suppose
they
have
rearranged
the
place
i
can
only
go
by
what
the
local
detectives
have
seen
by
the
police
reports
but
i
do
not
understand
this
extreme
disorder
there
is
no
reason
why
there
should
be
a
struggle
when
the
robber
was
armed
with
a
pistol
if
siders
was
supposed
to
have
been
interrupted
when
writing
a
letter
interrupted
by
a
thief
come
with
intent
to
steal
a
thief
armed
with
a
revolver
the
sight
of
this
weapon
alone
would
be
sufficient
to
insure
his
not
moving
from
his
seat
i
can
understand
the
open
drawers
and
cupboard
that
is
explained
by
the
thief
s
hasty
search
for
booty
but
the
torn
window
curtain
and
the
overturned
chairs
are
peculiar
of
course
there
is
always
a
possibility
that
the
thief
might
have
entered
one
room
while
siders
was
in
the
other
that
the
latter
might
have
surprised
the
robber
in
his
search
for
money
or
valuables
and
that
there
might
have
been
a
struggle
before
the
intruder
could
pull
out
his
revolver
oh
if
i
could
only
have
seen
the
body
this
is
working
under
terrific
difficulties
the
marks
of
a
struggle
would
have
been
very
plain
on
the
clothes
and
on
the
person
of
the
murdered
man
but
this
letter
i
do
not
understand
this
letter
at
all
it
is
the
dead
man
s
handwriting
that
we
know
but
why
did
not
the
friend
to
whom
it
was
addressed
come
forward
and
make
himself
known
as
far
as
i
can
learn
from
the
police
reports
in
g
there
was
no
personal
interest
shown
no
personal
inquiries
made
about
the
dead
man
there
was
only
the
natural
excitement
that
a
murder
would
create
now
a
family
expecting
to
make
a
pleasure
excursion
with
a
friend
in
a
day
or
two
and
suddenly
hearing
that
this
friend
had
been
found
murdered
in
his
lodgings
would
be
inclined
to
take
some
little
personal
interest
in
the
matter
these
people
must
have
been
in
town
and
at
home
for
the
excursion
spoken
of
in
the
letter
was
to
occur
two
days
after
the
murder
miss
roemer
s
remark
about
the
dread
that
some
people
have
as
to
any
connection
with
the
police
is
true
to
a
limited
extent
only
it
is
true
only
of
the
ignorant
mind
not
of
a
man
presumably
and
properly
educated
i
do
not
understand
why
the
man
to
whom
this
letter
was
addressed
has
not
made
himself
known
the
only
explanation
is
that
there
was
no
such
man
a
sudden
sharp
whistle
broke
from
the
detective
s
lips
i
must
examine
the
dead
man
s
personal
effects
his
baggage
his
papers
there
may
be
something
there
his
queer
letter
to
graumann
his
desire
that
the
latter
s
visit
should
be
kept
secret
a
visit
which
apparently
had
no
cause
at
all
except
to
get
graumann
to
the
house
to
get
him
to
the
house
in
a
way
that
he
should
be
seen
coming
but
should
not
be
seen
going
away
what
does
this
mean
graumann
was
the
only
person
against
whom
siders
had
an
active
cause
of
quarrel
for
the
moment
there
was
one
other
man
whom
he
hated
and
this
other
man
was
the
prosecuting
attorney
who
would
conduct
any
case
of
murder
that
came
up
in
the
town
of
g
now
john
siders
is
found
murdered
is
found
killed
in
his
lodgings
the
morning
after
he
has
arranged
things
so
that
his
antagonist
his
rival
in
love
albert
graumann
shall
come
under
suspicion
of
having
murdered
him
what
evidence
have
we
that
this
man
did
not
commit
suicide
we
have
the
evidence
of
the
disorder
in
the
room
a
disorder
that
could
have
been
made
just
as
well
by
the
man
himself
before
he
ended
his
own
life
we
have
the
evidence
of
a
letter
to
some
unknown
making
plans
for
pleasure
during
the
next
days
and
speaking
of
further
plans
presumably
concerning
business
for
the
future
in
a
town
the
size
of
g
where
every
one
must
have
read
of
the
murder
no
one
has
come
forward
claiming
to
be
the
friend
for
whom
this
letter
was
written
until
this
unknown
makes
himself
known
the
letter
as
an
evidence
points
rather
to
premeditated
suicide
than
to
the
contrary
oh
if
i
could
only
have
seen
the
body
they
tell
me
the
pistol
was
found
some
little
distance
from
the
body
is
it
at
all
likely
that
a
murderer
would
go
away
leaving
such
evidence
behind
him
if
graumaun
had
killed
siders
in
a
hasty
quarrel
he
might
possibly
in
his
excitement
have
left
his
revolver
but
i
have
already
disposed
of
this
possibility
a
man
of
sufficient
brains
to
so
carefully
plan
his
suicide
as
to
conceal
every
trace
of
it
and
cast
suspicion
upon
the
man
who
had
made
him
unhappy
such
a
one
would
be
quite
clever
enough
to
throw
the
pistol
far
away
from
his
body
and
to
leave
no
traces
of
powder
on
his
coat
or
any
such
other
evidence
if
i
were
to
say
now
what
i
think
i
would
say
that
john
siders
deliberately
took
his
own
life
and
planned
it
in
such
a
way
as
to
cast
suspicion
upon
albert
graumann
but
that
would
indeed
be
a
terrible
revenge
and
i
must
have
some
tangible
proof
of
it
before
any
court
will
accept
my
belief
this
proof
must
be
hidden
somewhere
the
thing
for
me
to
do
is
to
find
the
evidence
gathered
at
the
time
of
the
death
went
to
show
that
siders
had
been
paid
a
considerable
sum
in
cash
for
the
sale
of
his
property
at
grunau
and
there
was
no
trace
of
his
having
deposited
this
sum
in
any
bank
in
g
or
in
grunau
in
both
of
which
places
he
had
deposited
other
securities
therefore
the
money
had
presumably
been
in
his
room
at
the
time
of
his
death
a
search
had
been
made
for
this
money
in
every
possible
place
of
concealment
among
the
dead
man
s
belongings
and
it
had
not
been
found
muller
asked
the
police
commissioner
to
give
him
the
key
to
the
rooms
which
were
still
officially
closed
and
also
the
keys
to
the
dead
man
s
pieces
of
baggage
commissioner
lange
seemed
to
think
all
this
extra
search
quite
unnecessary
as
it
did
not
occur
to
him
that
anything
else
was
to
be
looked
for
except
the
money
it
was
quite
late
when
muller
began
his
examination
of
the
dead
man
s
effects
he
was
struck
by
the
fact
that
there
was
scarcely
a
bit
of
paper
to
be
found
anywhere
no
letters
no
business
papers
except
bank
books
showing
the
amount
of
his
securities
in
the
bank
in
g
and
in
grunau
and
giving
facts
about
some
investments
in
chicago
there
was
nothing
of
more
recent
date
and
no
personal
correspondence
whatever
the
same
was
true
of
the
pockets
of
the
suit
siders
had
been
wearing
at
the
time
of
his
death
a
man
of
any
property
or
position
at
all
in
the
world
gathers
about
him
so
much
of
this
kind
of
material
that
its
absence
shows
premeditation
the
suit
siders
had
been
wearing
when
he
was
killed
was
lying
on
the
table
in
the
room
it
was
a
plain
grey
business
suit
of
good
cut
and
material
the
body
had
been
prepared
for
burial
in
a
beseeming
suit
of
black
muller
made
a
careful
examination
of
the
clothes
and
found
only
what
the
police
reports
showed
him
had
already
been
found
by
the
examination
made
by
the
local
authorities
upon
a
second
careful
examination
however
he
found
that
in
one
of
the
vest
pockets
there
was
a
little
extra
pocket
like
a
change
pocket
and
in
it
he
found
a
crumpled
piece
of
paper
he
took
it
out
smoothed
and
read
it
it
was
a
post
office
receipt
for
a
registered
letter
the
date
was
still
clear
but
the
name
of
the
person
to
whom
the
letter
had
been
addressed
was
illegible
the
creases
of
the
paper
and
a
certain
dampness
as
if
it
had
been
inadvertently
touched
by
a
wet
finger
had
smeared
the
writing
but
the
letter
had
been
sent
the
day
before
the
death
of
john
siders
and
it
had
been
registered
from
the
main
post
office
in
g
this
was
sufficient
for
muller
then
he
turned
to
the
desk
here
also
there
was
nothing
that
could
help
him
but
a
sudden
thought
came
to
him
and
he
took
up
the
blotting
pad
this
to
his
delight
was
in
the
form
of
a
book
with
a
handsome
embroidered
cover
it
looked
comparatively
new
and
was
as
muller
surmised
a
gift
from
miss
roemer
to
her
betrothed
but
few
of
the
pages
had
been
used
and
on
two
of
them
a
closely
written
letter
had
been
blotted
several
times
showing
that
there
had
been
several
sheets
of
the
letter
muller
held
it
up
to
the
but
the
repeated
blotting
had
blurred
the
writing
to
such
an
extent
that
it
was
impossible
to
decipher
any
but
a
few
disconnected
words
which
gave
no
clue
on
a
page
further
along
on
the
blotter
however
he
saw
what
appeared
to
be
the
impression
of
an
address
he
held
it
up
to
the
glass
and
gave
a
whistle
of
delight
the
words
could
be
plainly
deciphered
here
mr
leo
pernburg
frankfurt
am
main
mainzer
and
above
the
name
was
a
smear
which
after
a
little
study
could
be
deciphered
as
the
written
word
with
this
page
of
the
blotter
carefully
tucked
away
in
his
pocketbook
muller
hurried
to
the
post
office
arriving
just
at
closing
hour
he
made
himself
known
at
once
to
the
postmaster
and
asked
to
be
shown
the
records
of
registered
letters
sent
on
a
certain
date
here
he
found
scheduled
a
letter
addressed
to
leo
pernburg
frankfurt
am
main
sent
by
john
siders
g
josef
street
muller
then
hastened
to
the
telegraph
office
and
despatched
a
lengthy
telegram
to
the
postal
authorities
in
frankfurt
am
main
when
the
answer
came
to
him
next
morning
he
packed
his
grip
and
took
the
first
express
train
leaving
g
he
first
made
a
short
visit
however
to
albert
graumann
s
cell
in
the
prison
muller
was
much
too
not
to
relieve
the
anxiety
of
this
man
to
whom
such
mental
strain
might
easily
prove
fatal
he
told
graumann
that
he
was
going
in
search
of
evidence
which
might
throw
light
on
the
death
of
siders
and
comforted
the
prisoner
with
the
assurance
that
he
muller
believed
graumann
innocent
and
believed
also
that
within
a
day
or
two
he
would
return
to
g
with
proofs
that
his
belief
was
the
right
one
three
days
later
muller
returned
to
grunau
and
went
at
once
to
the
graumann
home
it
was
quite
late
when
he
arrived
but
he
had
already
notified
miss
roemer
by
telegram
as
to
his
coming
with
a
request
that
she
should
be
ready
to
see
him
he
found
her
waiting
for
him
pale
and
when
he
arrived
i
have
been
to
frankfurt
am
main
he
said
and
i
have
seen
pernburg
yes
yes
that
is
the
name
now
i
remember
interrupted
the
girl
eagerly
that
is
the
name
of
john
s
friend
i
have
seen
pernburg
and
he
gave
me
this
muller
laid
a
thick
envelope
on
the
girl
s
lap
she
looked
down
at
it
her
eyes
widening
as
if
she
had
seen
a
ghost
that
that
is
john
s
writing
she
exclaimed
in
a
hoarse
whisper
where
did
it
come
from
pernburg
gave
it
to
me
the
day
before
his
death
john
siders
sent
him
this
letter
requesting
that
pernburg
forward
it
to
you
before
a
certain
date
when
i
explained
the
circumstances
to
pernburg
he
gave
me
the
letter
at
once
i
feel
that
this
paper
holds
the
clue
to
the
mystery
will
you
open
it
with
trembling
hands
the
girl
tore
open
the
envelope
it
enclosed
still
another
sealed
envelope
without
an
address
but
there
was
a
sheet
of
paper
around
this
letter
on
which
was
written
the
following
my
beloved
eleonore
before
you
read
what
i
have
to
say
to
you
here
i
want
you
to
promise
me
in
memory
of
our
love
and
by
your
hope
of
future
salvation
that
you
will
do
what
i
ask
you
to
do
i
ask
you
to
give
the
enclosed
letter
although
it
is
addressed
to
you
to
the
judge
who
will
preside
in
the
trial
against
graumann
the
letter
is
written
to
you
and
will
be
given
back
to
you
for
you
the
beloved
of
my
soul
you
are
the
only
human
being
with
whom
i
can
still
communicate
to
whom
i
can
still
express
my
wishes
but
you
must
not
give
the
letter
to
the
judge
until
you
have
assured
yourself
that
the
prosecuting
attorney
insists
upon
graumann
s
guilt
in
case
he
is
acquitted
which
i
do
not
think
probable
then
open
this
letter
in
the
presence
of
graumann
himself
and
one
or
two
witnesses
for
i
wish
graumann
who
is
innocent
to
be
able
to
prove
his
innocence
you
will
know
by
this
time
that
i
have
determined
to
end
my
life
by
my
own
hand
forgive
me
beloved
i
can
not
live
on
without
you
without
the
honour
of
which
i
was
robbed
so
unjustly
god
bless
you
one
who
will
love
you
even
beyond
the
grave
remember
your
promise
it
was
given
to
the
dead
john
oh
what
does
it
all
mean
asked
eleonora
dropping
the
letter
in
her
lap
it
is
as
i
thought
replied
muller
john
siders
took
his
own
life
but
made
every
arrangement
to
have
suspicion
fall
upon
but
why
oh
why
it
was
a
terrible
revenge
but
perhaps
perhaps
it
was
just
retribution
graumaun
would
not
understand
that
siders
could
have
been
suspected
of
and
imprisoned
for
a
theft
he
had
not
committed
he
must
know
now
that
it
is
quite
possible
for
a
man
to
be
in
danger
of
sentence
of
death
even
for
a
crime
of
which
he
is
oh
my
god
it
is
the
girl
s
head
fell
across
her
folded
arms
on
the
table
deep
shuddering
sobs
shook
her
frame
muller
waited
quietly
until
the
first
shock
had
passed
finally
her
sobs
died
away
and
she
raised
her
head
again
what
am
i
to
do
she
asked
you
must
open
this
letter
in
the
presence
of
the
police
commissioner
and
but
this
promise
this
promise
that
he
asks
of
me
that
i
should
wait
until
the
trial
you
have
not
given
this
promise
would
you
take
it
upon
yourself
to
endanger
your
guardian
s
life
still
more
every
further
day
spent
in
his
prison
in
this
anxiety
might
be
but
this
promise
the
promise
demanded
of
me
by
the
man
to
whom
i
had
given
my
love
is
it
not
my
duty
to
keep
it
muller
rose
from
his
chair
his
slight
figure
seemed
to
grow
taller
and
the
gentleness
in
his
voice
gave
way
to
a
commanding
tone
of
firm
decision
our
duty
is
to
the
living
not
to
the
dead
the
dead
have
no
right
to
drag
down
others
after
them
believe
me
miss
roemer
the
purpose
that
was
in
your
betrothed
s
mind
when
he
ended
his
own
life
has
been
fulfilled
albert
graumann
knows
now
what
are
the
feelings
of
a
man
who
bears
the
prison
stigma
unjustly
he
will
never
again
judge
his
as
harshly
as
he
has
done
until
now
his
soul
has
been
purged
in
these
terrible
days
have
you
the
right
to
endanger
his
life
needlessly
oh
i
do
not
know
i
do
not
know
what
to
i
have
no
choice
said
muller
firmly
it
is
my
duty
to
make
known
the
fact
to
the
police
commissioner
that
there
is
such
a
letter
in
existence
the
police
commissioner
will
then
have
to
follow
his
duty
in
demanding
the
letter
from
you
pernburg
sider
s
friend
saw
this
argument
at
once
although
he
also
had
a
letter
from
the
dead
man
asking
him
to
send
the
enclosure
to
you
registered
on
a
certain
date
he
knew
that
it
was
his
duty
to
give
all
the
papers
to
the
authorities
would
it
not
be
better
for
you
to
give
them
up
of
your
own
free
will
muller
took
a
step
nearer
the
girl
and
whispered
and
would
it
not
be
a
noble
revenge
on
your
part
you
would
be
indeed
returning
good
for
eleonora
clasped
her
hands
and
her
lips
moved
as
if
in
silent
prayer
then
she
rose
slowly
and
held
out
the
letters
to
muller
do
what
you
will
with
them
she
said
my
strength
is
at
an
the
next
day
in
the
presence
of
commissioner
lange
and
of
the
accused
albert
graumann
muller
opened
the
letter
which
he
had
received
from
miss
roemer
and
read
it
aloud
the
girl
herself
by
her
own
request
was
not
present
both
muller
and
graumann
understood
that
the
strain
of
this
message
from
the
dead
would
be
too
much
for
her
to
bear
this
was
the
letter
g
september
my
beloved
when
you
put
this
letter
in
the
hands
of
the
judge
i
will
have
found
in
death
the
peace
that
i
could
never
find
on
earth
there
was
no
chance
of
happiness
for
me
since
i
have
realised
that
i
love
you
that
you
love
me
and
that
i
must
give
you
up
if
i
am
to
remain
what
i
have
always
been
in
spite
of
everything
a
man
of
honour
albert
graumann
would
keep
his
word
this
i
know
wherever
you
might
follow
me
as
my
wife
there
his
will
would
have
been
before
us
blasting
my
reputation
blackening
the
flame
which
you
were
to
bear
i
could
not
have
endured
it
my
soul
was
sick
of
all
this
secrecy
sick
at
the
injustice
of
mankind
in
spite
of
worldly
success
my
life
was
cold
and
barren
in
the
strange
land
to
which
i
had
fled
my
home
called
to
me
and
i
came
back
to
it
i
kissed
the
earth
of
my
own
country
and
i
wept
at
my
mother
s
grave
i
was
happy
again
under
the
skies
which
had
domed
above
my
childhood
for
i
am
an
honest
man
beloved
and
i
always
have
been
one
day
i
sat
at
table
beside
the
man
the
judge
who
condemned
me
here
in
g
in
those
terrible
days
he
naturally
did
not
know
me
again
i
myself
brought
the
conversation
around
to
a
professional
subject
i
asked
him
if
it
were
not
possible
that
circumstantial
evidence
could
lie
if
the
entire
past
the
reputation
of
the
accused
would
not
be
a
factor
in
his
favour
the
judge
denied
it
it
was
his
opinion
beyond
a
doubt
that
circumstantial
evidence
was
sufficient
to
convict
anyone
my
soul
rose
within
me
this
infallibility
this
legal
arrogance
aroused
my
blood
that
man
should
have
a
lesson
i
said
to
myself
but
i
had
forgotten
it
all
all
my
anger
all
my
hatred
and
bitterness
when
i
met
you
i
dare
not
trust
myself
to
think
of
you
too
much
now
that
everything
is
arranged
for
the
one
last
step
it
takes
all
my
control
to
keep
my
decision
unwavering
while
i
sit
here
and
tell
you
how
much
your
love
your
great
tenderness
your
sweet
trust
in
me
meant
to
me
let
me
talk
rather
of
albert
graumann
i
will
forgive
him
for
believing
in
my
guilt
but
i
can
not
forgive
him
that
he
the
man
of
cultivation
and
mental
grasp
could
not
believe
it
possible
for
a
convicted
thief
to
have
repented
and
to
have
lived
an
honest
life
after
the
atonement
of
his
crime
i
still
can
not
believe
that
this
was
graumann
s
opinion
i
am
forced
to
think
that
it
was
an
excuse
only
on
his
part
an
excuse
to
keep
us
apart
an
excuse
to
keep
you
for
himself
you
are
lost
to
me
now
there
is
nothing
more
in
life
for
me
if
the
injustice
of
mankind
has
stained
my
honour
beyond
repair
has
robbed
me
of
every
chance
of
happiness
at
any
time
and
in
any
place
then
i
die
easily
beloved
for
there
is
little
charm
in
such
a
life
as
would
be
mine
after
this
but
i
do
not
wish
to
die
quite
in
vain
there
are
two
men
who
have
touched
my
life
who
need
the
lesson
my
death
can
teach
them
these
men
are
albert
graumann
and
the
prosecuting
attorney
gustav
schmidt
the
man
who
once
condemned
me
so
cruelly
his
present
position
would
make
him
the
representative
of
the
state
in
a
murder
trial
and
i
know
his
opinions
too
well
not
to
foresee
that
he
would
declare
graumann
guilty
because
of
the
circumstantial
evidence
which
will
be
against
him
my
letter
given
to
the
presiding
judge
after
the
attorney
has
made
his
speech
will
cause
him
humiliation
will
ruin
his
brilliant
arguments
and
cast
ridicule
upon
him
do
not
think
me
hard
or
revengeful
i
do
not
hate
anyone
now
that
death
is
so
near
but
is
it
inhuman
that
i
should
want
to
teach
these
two
men
a
lesson
a
lesson
which
they
need
believe
me
and
it
is
such
a
slight
compensation
for
the
torture
these
last
eight
years
have
been
to
me
and
now
i
will
explain
in
detail
all
the
circumstances
i
have
arranged
that
albert
graumann
shall
come
to
me
on
the
evening
of
september
between
and
o
clock
i
asked
him
to
do
so
by
letter
asking
him
also
to
keep
the
fact
of
his
visit
to
me
a
secret
the
of
september
i
received
his
answer
promising
that
he
would
come
therefore
i
can
look
upon
everything
that
is
to
happen
as
having
already
happened
for
now
there
need
be
no
further
change
in
my
plans
i
will
send
this
letter
this
evening
to
my
friend
pernburg
in
frankfurt
am
main
in
case
anything
should
happen
that
would
render
impossible
for
me
to
carry
out
my
plans
i
will
send
pernburg
another
letter
asking
him
not
to
carry
out
the
instructions
of
the
first
i
can
now
proceed
to
tell
you
what
will
happen
here
evening
the
of
september
albert
graumann
will
come
to
me
unknown
to
his
family
or
friends
as
i
have
asked
him
to
come
i
will
so
arrange
it
that
the
old
servant
will
see
him
come
in
but
will
not
see
him
go
out
my
landlady
will
not
be
in
my
way
for
she
has
already
told
me
that
she
will
spend
the
night
of
the
with
her
mother
in
another
part
of
the
city
it
is
to
be
a
birthday
celebration
i
believe
so
that
i
can
be
certain
her
plans
will
not
be
changed
graumann
and
i
will
be
alone
therefore
with
no
reliable
witnesses
near
i
will
keep
him
there
for
a
little
while
with
commonplace
conversation
for
i
have
nothing
to
say
to
him
if
he
moves
near
the
desk
i
will
upset
the
inkbottle
the
spots
on
his
clothes
will
be
another
evidence
against
him
i
will
endeavour
to
get
him
to
keep
my
jewelry
which
is
as
you
know
of
considerable
value
i
will
tell
him
that
i
am
going
away
for
a
while
and
ask
him
to
take
charge
of
it
for
me
i
myself
will
take
him
down
to
the
door
and
let
him
out
when
i
have
satisfied
myself
that
the
old
servant
is
in
bed
or
at
least
at
the
back
of
the
house
the
revolver
which
shall
end
my
misery
is
graumann
s
property
i
took
it
from
its
place
without
his
knowledge
the
gulden
which
i
told
my
landlady
were
still
in
the
house
and
which
would
therefore
be
thought
missing
after
my
death
i
have
deposited
in
a
bank
in
frankfort
in
your
name
here
is
the
certificate
of
deposit
i
will
endeavour
not
to
hold
the
revolver
sufficiently
close
to
have
the
powder
burn
my
clothes
and
i
will
exert
every
effort
of
mind
and
body
to
throw
it
far
from
me
after
i
have
fired
the
fatal
shot
i
think
that
i
will
be
able
to
do
this
for
i
am
a
very
good
shot
and
i
have
no
fear
of
death
one
thing
more
i
will
do
to
turn
aside
all
suspicion
of
suicide
i
will
write
a
letter
to
some
person
who
does
not
exist
a
letter
which
will
make
it
appear
as
if
i
were
in
excellent
humour
and
planning
for
the
future
and
now
to
life
people
have
called
me
eccentric
they
may
be
right
this
last
deed
of
mine
at
least
is
out
of
the
ordinary
no
one
will
say
now
that
ended
my
life
in
a
moment
of
darkened
mind
in
a
rush
of
despair
my
brain
is
perfectly
clear
my
heart
beats
calmly
now
that
i
have
arranged
everything
for
my
departure
from
this
world
of
falsehood
and
unreality
my
last
deed
shall
go
to
prove
to
the
world
how
little
actual
apparent
facts
can
be
trusted
the
one
thing
real
the
one
thing
true
in
all
this
world
of
falsehood
was
your
love
and
your
trust
i
thank
you
for
it
theodor
bellmann
known
as
john
siders
joseph
muller
refuses
to
take
any
particular
credit
for
this
case
the
letter
would
have
come
in
time
to
prevent
graumann
s
conviction
without
his
assistance
he
says
the
only
person
whose
gratitude
he
has
a
right
to
is
prosecuting
attorney
gustav
schmidt
he
managed
to
have
the
police
commissioner
in
g
read
the
letter
in
detail
to
the
attorney
but
muller
himself
knows
that
it
failed
of
its
effect
so
far
as
that
dignitary
was
concerned
for
nothing
but
open
ridicule
could
ever
convince
a
man
of
such
decided
opinions
that
he
is
not
the
one
infallible
person
in
the
world
but
albert
graumann
had
learned
his
lesson
and
he
told
muller
himself
that
the
few
days
of
life
which
might
remain
to
him
were
a
gift
to
him
from
the
detective
he
felt
that
his
weak
heart
would
not
have
stood
the
strain
and
the
disgrace
of
an
open
trial
even
if
that
trial
ended
in
acquittal
two
months
later
he
was
found
dead
in
his
bed
a
calm
smile
on
his
lips
before
he
died
he
had
learned
that
it
was
the
undaunted
courage
of
his
timid
little
old
aunt
that
had
brought
muller
to
take
charge
of
the
case
and
to
free
her
beloved
nephew
from
the
dreaded
prison
and
the
last
days
that
these
two
passed
together
were
very
happy
but
as
aforesaid
muller
refuses
to
have
this
case
included
in
the
list
of
his
successes
he
did
not
change
the
ultimate
result
he
merely
anticipated
it
he
says
