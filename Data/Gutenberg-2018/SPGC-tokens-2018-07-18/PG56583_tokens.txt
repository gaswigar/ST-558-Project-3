chapter
i
plans
it
was
the
third
week
in
september
when
the
fairfields
left
the
seashore
and
returned
to
their
vernondale
home
now
my
child
said
fairfield
as
they
sat
on
the
veranda
after
dinner
i
will
unfold
to
you
my
plans
for
the
coming
winter
and
you
may
accept
or
reject
or
amend
them
as
you
proceed
said
patty
settling
herself
comfortably
in
her
wicker
chair
i
feel
in
an
amiable
mood
this
evening
and
will
probably
agree
to
anything
you
may
i
ve
been
thinking
for
some
time
went
on
her
father
that
i
don
t
want
to
spend
the
coming
winter
in
vernondale
i
would
much
rather
be
in
new
reason
number
said
patty
checking
it
off
on
her
forefinger
and
smiling
at
her
father
yes
he
responded
with
an
answering
smile
she
is
reason
number
one
but
there
are
to
readers
who
are
unfamiliar
with
patty
s
earlier
history
we
may
say
right
here
that
her
mother
had
died
when
patty
was
but
three
years
old
at
present
she
lived
with
her
father
in
their
little
home
in
vernondale
an
establishment
of
which
patty
greatly
prided
herself
on
her
management
recently
fairfield
had
become
engaged
to
miss
nan
allen
a
young
lady
who
lived
in
philadelphia
and
who
was
a
dear
friend
of
patty
s
you
know
fairfield
went
on
this
vernondale
house
was
only
an
experiment
and
although
it
has
proved
successful
in
its
own
way
i
want
to
try
another
experiment
of
a
winter
in
the
city
as
you
so
wisely
discern
it
is
partly
for
the
sake
of
being
nearer
to
nan
the
allens
will
spend
part
of
the
winter
in
new
york
and
too
philadelphia
is
more
easily
accessible
from
there
than
from
here
we
shall
not
be
married
until
spring
and
so
your
absolute
monarchy
will
extend
through
the
winter
and
you
can
then
abdicate
in
favor
of
the
new
and
i
ll
be
glad
enough
to
do
it
cried
patty
it
isn
t
abdication
at
all
or
if
it
is
i
m
glad
of
it
i
m
perfectly
delighted
that
you
re
going
to
marry
nan
and
though
it
does
seem
ridiculous
to
have
one
of
my
own
friends
for
a
stepmother
yet
she
s
six
years
older
than
i
am
and
if
she
wants
to
rule
me
with
a
rod
of
iron
she
i
fancy
there
won
t
be
much
stepmothering
about
it
i
m
afraid
you
ll
be
two
refractory
children
and
i
ll
have
to
take
care
of
you
i
don
t
know
about
that
said
patty
laughing
you
ve
become
so
absurdly
young
yourself
of
late
that
i
think
i
shall
have
to
take
care
of
you
two
but
tell
me
some
more
about
your
new
york
plans
shall
we
have
a
house
of
our
own
no
i
think
winter
although
you
are
all
that
is
admirable
by
way
of
a
housekeeper
i
ve
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
s
too
much
responsibility
for
you
and
of
course
would
be
much
more
so
in
the
city
so
i
think
we
ll
take
a
suite
of
rooms
in
some
nice
apartment
hotel
this
you
see
will
make
it
more
convenient
for
me
in
regard
to
my
business
for
i
m
quite
ready
to
confess
that
i
m
tired
of
enjoying
a
commuter
s
privileges
from
our
city
home
i
could
probably
reach
my
office
in
less
than
half
an
hour
while
from
here
it
takes
me
fully
an
hour
and
a
half
besides
the
discomforts
of
the
railroad
and
ferry
that
would
be
nice
said
patty
thoughtfully
then
we
wouldn
t
have
to
have
breakfast
so
early
and
i
wouldn
t
have
to
wait
for
you
so
long
at
another
thing
went
on
her
father
is
your
own
education
i
want
you
to
have
a
year
or
two
at
some
good
school
in
the
city
and
i
do
not
want
you
to
go
back
and
forth
every
day
from
here
and
you
ought
to
take
singing
lessons
and
there
are
lots
of
things
you
ought
to
learn
during
your
rather
migratory
life
of
the
past
two
years
your
education
has
really
been
neglected
and
it
won
t
do
you
re
growing
up
to
be
sure
but
you
re
still
a
schoolgirl
and
must
remain
one
for
a
couple
of
years
more
at
least
when
we
take
nan
into
the
family
she
can
look
after
the
housekeeping
and
so
you
will
be
free
to
attend
to
your
studies
but
this
winter
as
i
say
you
must
not
have
household
cares
to
interfere
and
so
a
few
rooms
in
some
nice
hotel
will
make
a
home
for
us
that
shall
be
cosey
and
pleasant
and
yet
not
fill
your
life
with
the
cares
and
duties
of
all
right
papa
said
patty
i
think
it
will
be
lovely
and
i
m
ready
to
go
right
straight
off
of
course
i
m
sorry
to
leave
the
vernondale
girls
and
they
ll
be
as
mad
as
hops
at
me
for
going
but
i
do
love
the
city
and
i
think
we
ll
have
a
beautiful
time
when
shall
we
start
not
said
fairfield
smiling
at
his
impetuous
daughter
there
are
some
trifling
details
to
be
settled
first
you
see
you
re
a
country
girl
my
child
and
deplorably
ignorant
of
city
ways
has
it
occurred
to
you
that
it
would
hardly
do
for
you
and
me
to
live
alone
in
a
city
hotel
for
i
must
necessarily
be
down
at
my
office
all
day
and
too
i
shall
probably
make
occasional
trips
to
philadelphia
at
such
times
you
would
be
alone
in
our
apartment
which
is
of
course
out
of
the
question
have
you
anything
to
suggest
i
never
thought
of
that
i
thought
we
could
live
together
there
just
the
same
as
we
do
here
you
re
always
away
all
yes
but
here
there
are
the
three
servants
to
look
after
you
and
too
conventions
are
not
quite
the
same
in
new
york
and
vernondale
i
don
t
want
a
governess
for
you
for
i
want
you
to
have
the
experiences
of
school
i
might
have
a
maid
said
patty
anxious
to
suggest
something
i
might
take
no
said
her
father
that
isn
t
the
kind
of
person
you
require
the
third
person
in
our
home
must
be
a
lady
who
can
look
after
you
and
advise
you
and
occasionally
go
about
with
well
then
marry
nan
right
away
and
let
her
do
all
that
would
do
admirably
but
there
is
one
obstacle
i
laid
that
plan
before
nan
herself
and
she
positively
refused
to
come
and
be
one
of
us
before
next
well
what
we
do
asked
patty
why
i
think
this
the
solution
of
the
problem
let
us
take
grandma
elliott
to
spend
the
winter
with
just
the
thing
exclaimed
patty
clapping
her
hands
she
s
the
very
one
she
loves
to
live
in
the
city
and
she
s
lived
there
so
much
she
knows
all
about
it
and
i
m
sure
she
d
be
glad
to
yes
she
would
be
just
the
right
one
she
s
a
very
wise
lady
and
although
she
s
perhaps
sixty
years
old
she
is
as
active
and
energetic
as
many
much
younger
women
she
is
quite
conversant
with
the
proprieties
and
would
know
even
better
than
i
just
what
you
can
and
can
t
do
for
you
must
know
patty
girl
that
your
life
in
new
york
will
be
more
restricted
in
many
ways
than
it
is
here
there
are
certain
rules
that
must
be
observed
and
while
i
want
you
to
have
a
good
time
and
a
happy
time
yet
you
must
realise
that
you
are
still
only
a
schoolgirl
and
must
conduct
yourself
as
can
t
i
go
to
anything
except
school
papa
asked
patty
looking
a
little
dismayed
well
perhaps
on
nice
afternoons
i
might
take
you
for
a
walk
around
the
block
said
her
father
laughing
at
her
anxious
face
but
suppose
we
go
over
and
see
what
grandma
elliott
has
to
say
about
all
right
said
patty
but
you
must
protect
me
from
marian
s
ferocity
she
ll
be
as
mad
as
a
raging
when
the
question
of
the
fairfields
permanent
residence
was
under
discussion
a
year
earlier
grandma
elliott
was
perhaps
the
only
one
in
favour
of
their
living
in
new
york
the
younger
elliott
who
was
fairfield
s
sister
had
most
decidedly
been
of
the
opinion
that
a
home
in
the
small
town
of
vernondale
was
in
every
way
better
adapted
to
patty
s
welfare
patty
s
cousins
had
vociferously
agreed
to
this
and
the
result
was
that
fairfield
had
taken
a
house
in
vernondale
for
a
year
patty
had
proved
a
most
satisfactory
little
housekeeper
for
she
had
a
real
talent
for
household
management
but
even
aunt
alice
had
at
last
come
to
agree
with
fairfield
that
the
responsibilities
were
rather
heavy
for
a
schoolgirl
as
patty
had
anticipated
the
elliott
children
and
especially
marian
received
the
news
with
expressions
of
emphatic
disapproval
i
you
d
do
it
wailed
marian
but
i
think
it
s
perfectly
horrid
and
i
ll
never
forgive
you
as
long
as
i
live
i
don
t
you
to
go
away
from
vernondale
and
you
won
t
like
it
a
bit
in
new
york
i
know
you
won
t
you
can
t
do
anything
at
all
you
can
t
go
out
into
the
street
without
a
and
a
maid
and
two
policemen
and
whatever
will
the
tea
club
do
without
you
i
ll
have
all
the
tea
club
come
in
to
a
meeting
at
my
house
said
patty
anxious
to
pacify
her
cousin
we
won
t
come
we
ll
none
of
us
ever
speak
to
you
again
we
ll
cross
your
name
off
the
books
and
forget
that
you
ever
existed
it
was
so
seldom
that
the
gentle
marian
became
excited
over
anything
that
patty
felt
really
sorry
and
tried
her
best
to
put
the
matter
in
its
most
attractive
light
don
t
talk
like
that
marian
she
said
papa
has
decided
that
we
are
to
go
and
so
there
s
no
use
in
discussing
that
part
of
it
now
the
thing
to
do
is
to
find
the
bright
side
and
look
on
this
was
patty
fairfield
s
philosophy
in
a
nutshell
all
her
life
she
had
not
only
unquestioningly
accepted
the
inevitable
but
had
immediately
found
its
bright
side
and
ignored
all
others
this
was
partly
the
cause
and
partly
the
effect
of
her
bright
sunshiny
disposition
and
her
uniformly
happy
and
contented
frame
of
mind
just
think
marian
she
went
on
you
can
come
to
see
me
and
we
can
have
lots
of
fun
we
ll
have
all
the
girls
come
over
while
you
re
there
and
it
will
be
jolly
to
have
a
tea
club
meeting
in
a
yes
that
will
be
fun
assented
marian
but
after
the
meeting
we
ll
all
have
to
come
home
and
leave
you
there
i
suppose
i
m
selfish
but
i
don
t
care
i
don
t
you
to
go
away
from
vernondale
patty
fairfield
and
i
think
you
re
a
mean
old
thing
to
go
it
seemed
impossible
to
do
anything
with
marian
in
her
present
mood
so
patty
turned
to
aunt
alice
for
sympathy
i
feel
quite
as
sorry
to
have
you
go
as
marian
does
said
elliott
looking
lovingly
at
her
niece
though
i
don
t
express
myself
in
such
violent
language
but
brother
fred
has
been
talking
to
me
and
he
has
convinced
me
that
it
is
a
good
plan
in
many
ways
so
i
am
going
to
give
you
up
bravely
and
i
think
that
after
a
while
marian
will
be
able
to
face
the
matter
more
i
don
t
think
it
s
half
bad
broke
in
frank
elliott
of
course
we
shall
miss
patty
like
the
dickens
but
i
shall
spend
much
of
my
time
visiting
her
in
new
do
said
patty
delighted
at
this
support
come
just
as
often
as
you
like
and
i
ll
guarantee
that
you
ll
have
a
good
then
fairfield
proposed
his
plan
of
taking
grandma
elliott
to
spend
the
winter
with
them
in
the
city
grandma
s
eyes
beamed
with
delight
as
she
listened
for
the
old
lady
was
urban
in
her
tastes
and
had
lived
far
the
greater
part
of
her
life
in
new
york
aunt
alice
and
uncle
charlie
heartily
approved
of
this
arrangement
we
shall
miss
you
dreadfully
said
elliott
to
his
mother
but
we
shall
let
you
go
cheerfully
for
i
well
know
how
much
you
will
enjoy
but
marian
set
up
another
howl
it
s
bad
enough
to
have
patty
go
she
said
but
to
have
grandma
go
too
is
terrible
i
suppose
you
ll
take
mother
and
little
gilbert
as
marian
you
re
a
goose
said
patty
laughing
if
you
don
t
stop
talking
like
that
i
ll
take
along
and
keep
you
there
all
i
don
t
want
to
do
that
said
marian
but
i
don
t
want
you
to
go
either
i
know
one
thing
you
ve
been
there
a
week
you
ll
be
so
disgusted
you
ll
come
trailing
back
and
after
you
ve
visited
me
for
a
week
you
ll
be
so
enchanted
that
you
won
t
want
to
come
trailing
back
said
patty
laughing
at
her
cousin
s
expression
when
are
you
going
asked
marian
in
a
tone
of
final
resignation
very
soon
said
fairfield
for
i
want
to
get
this
ignorant
daughter
of
mine
into
school
as
quickly
as
possible
indeed
we
shall
go
as
soon
as
grandma
elliott
is
ready
to
accompany
you
won
t
have
to
wait
long
for
me
said
grandma
i
shall
be
all
ready
by
the
time
you
have
found
your
chapter
ii
a
last
meeting
patty
and
her
father
looked
at
several
apartments
before
they
found
one
which
seemed
satisfactory
in
every
way
it
was
necessary
that
it
should
be
near
the
school
patty
was
to
attend
and
also
conveniently
located
with
a
view
to
fairfield
s
daily
trips
downtown
besides
this
fairfield
was
particular
about
the
atmosphere
of
the
hotel
some
they
looked
into
seemed
to
patty
like
gorgeous
glittering
palaces
with
decorations
so
rich
and
ornate
as
to
be
almost
barbaric
these
fairfield
came
out
of
as
rapidly
as
he
went
in
and
more
than
once
patty
cast
a
longing
backward
glance
at
the
marble
floors
and
gilded
frescoes
which
her
father
seemed
to
scorn
on
the
other
hand
fairfield
was
equally
with
a
house
which
was
unattractive
in
appearance
or
whose
furnishings
were
not
tasteful
patty
almost
began
to
think
that
her
father
was
too
fastidious
and
would
never
be
able
to
find
a
place
that
would
exactly
suit
him
however
the
moment
they
stepped
inside
of
a
certain
apartment
hotel
named
the
wilberforce
fairfield
s
face
showed
an
expression
of
satisfaction
which
immediately
convinced
patty
that
they
had
struck
the
right
trail
at
last
and
so
it
proved
for
after
looking
into
several
suites
of
rooms
then
vacant
fairfield
told
patty
that
if
she
could
feel
contented
to
take
up
her
abode
there
he
thought
he
could
patty
willingly
agreed
for
she
too
liked
the
wilberforce
from
the
first
the
hotel
faced
central
park
and
though
not
among
the
largest
in
the
city
it
was
more
attractively
planned
than
any
of
the
others
they
had
looked
at
the
apartment
they
liked
best
was
a
corner
one
with
windows
looking
toward
the
east
and
south
the
large
corner
room
had
a
beautiful
bay
window
and
was
so
light
and
sunny
that
patty
declared
it
should
be
their
library
library
and
general
said
her
father
laughing
you
know
puss
you
can
t
have
as
many
rooms
at
your
disposal
in
the
city
as
you
have
in
vernondale
but
we
ll
have
all
our
books
and
favourite
belongings
in
this
room
and
i
m
sure
we
can
make
it
very
comfortable
then
this
smaller
room
next
will
be
a
more
formal
reception
room
for
casual
there
were
four
bedrooms
and
fairfield
insisted
that
the
two
sunniest
and
pleasantest
ones
should
be
assigned
to
patty
and
grandma
elliott
the
other
two
whose
windows
opened
on
an
airshaft
instead
of
on
the
street
were
to
be
fairfield
s
bedroom
and
a
the
whole
apartment
was
very
prettily
furnished
in
good
taste
and
entirely
without
that
lavish
use
of
bright
colours
which
so
often
characterises
a
hotel
the
library
was
in
green
and
the
little
in
pale
blue
patty
s
own
room
was
daintily
done
up
in
pink
and
though
perhaps
not
just
the
colour
she
would
have
chosen
it
was
so
fresh
and
pretty
that
she
expressed
herself
perfectly
satisfied
of
course
everything
in
the
way
of
chairs
and
tables
was
amply
provided
but
the
fairfields
proposed
to
bring
in
a
quantity
of
their
own
furniture
rugs
pictures
and
books
having
decided
on
the
apartment
fairfield
drew
a
plan
of
it
so
that
when
they
returned
home
they
might
better
decide
what
pieces
of
furniture
could
be
accommodated
patty
flew
around
from
room
to
room
in
great
delight
i
m
so
used
to
changing
my
home
she
said
that
i
really
feel
quite
at
home
in
this
apartment
already
this
library
is
going
to
be
the
loveliest
room
in
the
world
you
can
have
your
desk
there
and
i
can
have
my
little
desk
here
and
we
ll
have
our
big
library
table
in
the
middle
just
as
it
is
at
home
then
we
ll
have
grandma
s
little
by
this
window
this
big
fireplace
is
perfectly
fascinating
and
we
can
bring
our
brass
andirons
and
fireset
they
re
a
lot
prettier
than
these
old
black
iron
things
and
we
can
bring
a
or
two
can
t
we
papa
you
can
bring
whatever
you
like
chicken
but
i
wouldn
t
advise
carting
in
many
of
those
heavy
things
at
first
until
we
re
sure
we
like
the
place
well
enough
to
stay
all
winter
it
certainly
looks
attractive
and
it
has
been
highly
recommended
to
me
but
after
all
it
may
prove
to
have
serious
disadvantages
so
at
first
we
ll
just
bring
our
desks
and
some
books
and
pictures
and
a
few
little
trinkets
to
prettify
the
rooms
and
then
later
on
if
we
like
it
we
can
run
back
to
vernondale
for
a
few
more
yes
that
is
best
papa
said
patty
you
always
do
know
what
is
best
and
now
how
soon
do
you
suppose
we
can
come
in
to
stay
i
think
we
ll
move
next
saturday
i
can
take
a
whole
holiday
that
day
and
get
you
and
grandma
safely
established
so
eager
was
patty
to
select
and
pack
up
the
things
she
wanted
to
take
to
the
city
that
she
could
scarcely
wait
to
get
back
to
vernondale
it
had
been
a
tiresome
day
but
as
soon
as
she
reached
home
she
quite
forgot
her
fatigue
in
the
fun
of
making
her
selections
her
favourite
pictures
were
taken
from
the
walls
and
stood
in
the
hall
ready
to
be
packed
all
of
her
a
small
selection
of
and
a
large
box
of
books
were
added
then
patty
packed
her
own
trunk
and
her
father
s
fairfield
looked
after
the
heavier
matters
such
as
rugs
and
chairs
and
the
two
desks
and
grandma
s
little
altogether
it
seemed
like
a
regular
moving
and
marian
who
came
over
in
the
midst
of
the
excitement
sat
down
on
the
box
of
books
and
burst
into
tears
marian
said
patty
almost
crying
herself
if
you
don
t
stop
acting
like
that
i
don
t
know
what
i
shall
do
i
m
rapidly
growing
homesicker
and
homesicker
and
now
if
you
commence
to
weep
all
over
the
place
i
shall
just
go
to
pieces
but
you
to
go
away
wailed
marian
between
her
sobs
you
just
to
go
and
that
s
the
worst
of
it
if
you
cry
you
d
be
nothing
but
an
old
hypocrite
i
do
want
to
go
but
i
m
sorry
to
leave
vernondale
too
don
t
you
suppose
i
m
fond
of
all
you
girls
don
t
you
suppose
i
ll
miss
you
like
sixty
and
don
t
you
suppose
it
s
a
heap
worse
for
me
to
go
away
from
you
all
than
it
is
for
you
to
have
me
go
why
there
s
lots
of
you
to
cheer
each
other
up
and
there
s
only
one
of
me
but
what
s
the
use
of
acting
like
this
anyway
i
ve
got
to
go
and
i
might
as
well
go
laughing
as
crying
if
father
wanted
you
to
go
you
d
go
and
wouldn
t
do
all
i
could
to
make
it
harder
for
you
by
crying
from
morning
to
the
logic
of
these
remarks
seemed
to
impress
marian
for
she
stopped
crying
and
said
i
suppose
i
am
a
horrid
old
thing
to
act
so
and
i
am
going
to
stop
at
least
until
after
you
re
gone
and
then
i
m
going
to
cry
all
i
want
do
said
patty
have
a
real
good
time
and
cry
all
day
and
every
day
if
you
like
but
now
come
on
and
help
me
pack
my
marian
was
as
good
as
her
word
she
cried
no
more
and
though
her
demeanour
was
not
exactly
hilarious
she
ceased
wearing
a
reproachful
air
and
went
around
helping
patty
with
a
loving
the
last
few
days
before
their
departure
patty
and
fairfield
spent
at
the
elliotts
home
the
trunks
and
boxes
had
all
been
sent
away
and
boxley
hall
was
shut
up
and
securely
barred
and
fastened
the
servants
had
found
other
situations
mancy
was
going
to
live
at
miss
daggett
s
though
the
coloured
woman
was
not
all
sure
of
her
ability
to
stay
with
that
lady
pansy
was
to
live
with
the
elliotts
and
fairfield
had
promised
her
that
if
under
his
sister
s
tuition
she
became
a
competent
waitress
she
should
come
the
next
year
to
live
in
the
city
house
of
the
new
fairfield
pansy
was
delighted
at
this
prospect
for
she
had
become
devotedly
attached
to
the
fairfields
and
moreover
was
a
great
admirer
of
the
lovely
miss
allen
the
day
before
patty
was
to
leave
vernondale
the
tea
club
had
a
farewell
meeting
at
marian
s
you
know
patty
said
elsie
morris
that
you
ll
still
have
to
be
president
of
the
club
we
utterly
refuse
to
let
anyone
else
have
that
but
that
s
perfectly
silly
protested
patty
it
would
be
much
more
sensible
for
me
to
be
an
honourable
or
honorary
and
you
put
in
somebody
else
to
rule
the
club
this
pooh
said
ethel
holmes
don
t
flatter
yourself
you
ruled
this
club
no
said
patty
laughing
or
if
i
did
rule
them
they
overruled
me
you
re
a
fractious
lot
and
it
s
far
from
being
an
easy
task
to
be
your
president
however
as
i
want
you
to
have
somebody
to
keep
you
straight
during
my
absence
i
m
going
to
propose
my
cousin
marian
for
the
office
of
this
proposal
was
most
favourably
received
and
marian
was
unanimously
elected
president
of
the
tea
club
until
such
time
as
patty
should
return
to
vernondale
for
the
girls
one
and
all
refused
to
admit
that
patty
was
going
away
permanently
they
chose
to
assume
that
she
was
merely
going
to
new
york
for
the
winter
and
implicitly
believed
that
the
summer
months
would
see
her
again
established
at
boxley
hall
and
very
likely
we
return
said
patty
nobody
can
foretell
what
my
father
is
going
to
do
and
nobody
can
stop
him
when
he
once
decides
what
he
is
going
to
do
i
certainly
never
dreamed
he
was
going
to
marry
nan
until
he
told
me
so
aren
t
you
glad
about
it
asked
helen
preston
yes
indeed
exclaimed
patty
i
m
as
happy
as
can
be
about
it
i
just
love
nan
and
it
will
be
just
like
having
a
sister
i
wish
they
d
get
married
right
away
only
then
i
suppose
we
wouldn
t
have
grandma
elliott
with
us
this
winter
and
i
d
be
sorry
about
that
now
remember
girls
just
as
soon
as
we
get
settled
at
the
wilberforce
you
re
all
to
come
in
some
saturday
papa
says
not
to
come
for
tea
because
it
makes
you
so
late
getting
home
but
to
come
for
luncheon
and
he
ll
take
us
all
to
the
matinée
there
was
a
general
chorus
of
glee
at
this
for
the
girls
were
well
acquainted
with
the
kind
and
genial
fairfield
and
his
invitation
meant
a
delightful
treat
i
do
think
your
father
is
lovely
said
polly
stevens
and
i
think
you
re
going
to
have
beautiful
times
in
the
city
this
winter
i
really
quite
envy
but
i
wish
you
weren
t
going
said
christine
converse
i
don
t
see
how
the
tea
club
can
get
along
at
all
without
but
i
shall
often
come
out
to
the
tea
club
meetings
said
patty
of
course
i
shall
often
come
out
to
marian
s
to
stay
a
day
or
two
and
if
i
m
here
on
saturday
i
can
come
to
the
club
and
whenever
you
have
an
evening
entertainment
i
ll
come
out
for
i
hadn
t
thought
of
that
said
marian
brightening
a
little
and
you
can
come
out
to
our
house
for
thanksgiving
and
christmas
and
new
year
s
day
and
all
the
holidays
can
t
you
yes
said
patty
smiling
except
the
ones
you
come
in
to
spend
with
as
this
brighter
outlook
had
greatly
decreased
marian
s
aspect
of
hopeless
gloom
the
girls
all
began
to
wax
more
merry
and
soon
they
were
all
joking
and
laughing
in
true
tea
club
style
each
one
had
brought
a
parting
gift
for
patty
and
the
presentations
were
made
with
jesting
speeches
elsie
morris
brought
a
case
for
as
she
explained
patty
was
sure
to
be
knocked
down
and
run
over
every
day
by
automobiles
and
trolley
cars
and
the
healing
strips
would
prove
beneficial
laura
russell
brought
her
a
tiny
fern
growing
in
a
flower
pot
in
order
that
she
might
have
some
green
thing
to
remind
her
of
the
country
oho
said
ethel
holmes
i
m
going
to
give
you
a
dozen
green
things
to
remind
you
of
the
country
and
ethel
produced
her
gift
which
was
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
humorous
sketch
of
the
twelve
girls
of
the
tea
club
ethel
was
clever
at
drawing
and
the
group
was
well
caricatured
instead
of
drawing
the
faces
she
had
pasted
in
tiny
photographs
of
the
girls
features
and
moreover
had
realistically
bedecked
their
hats
with
tiny
feathers
and
microscopic
bows
of
real
ribbon
neckties
and
were
also
pasted
into
place
until
the
whole
affair
was
a
most
comical
representation
of
the
club
members
patty
was
delighted
and
declared
she
would
have
this
work
of
art
framed
and
conspicuously
hung
in
her
new
home
chapter
iii
a
new
home
on
saturday
morning
the
fairfields
and
grandma
elliott
started
for
their
new
york
home
uncle
charlie
went
to
town
on
the
same
train
and
the
rest
of
the
elliott
family
escorted
the
party
to
the
station
marian
had
determined
not
to
cry
when
patty
went
away
but
it
required
such
a
desperate
effort
to
carry
out
her
resolution
that
she
made
a
most
pathetic
picture
chirk
up
sis
said
frank
the
world
isn
t
coming
to
an
end
i
ll
be
a
patty
to
and
a
grandmother
too
asked
marian
smiling
in
spite
of
herself
yes
and
an
uncle
fred
i
ll
be
a
whole
family
tree
to
you
if
you
ll
only
smile
a
little
and
brace
up
you
look
like
a
dying
rubber
marian
did
brighten
up
a
little
and
as
the
train
rolled
out
of
the
station
the
last
patty
saw
of
her
cousin
was
a
positive
if
not
very
merry
smile
of
farewell
following
the
process
of
thought
usual
to
those
starting
off
on
a
journey
patty
spent
the
first
half
of
the
trip
to
new
york
thinking
about
those
she
had
left
behind
thinking
of
her
pleasant
vernondale
home
her
dear
relatives
and
the
merry
crowd
of
tea
club
girls
at
first
it
seemed
to
her
that
no
new
scenes
or
new
friends
could
ever
make
up
for
those
she
was
leaving
but
as
she
neared
jersey
city
and
as
she
crossed
the
long
ferry
her
thoughts
turned
forward
to
her
new
home
in
new
york
and
her
anticipations
began
to
seem
bright
and
happy
uncle
charlie
parted
from
them
at
the
ferry
and
soon
patty
and
her
large
family
as
she
called
it
since
the
addition
of
grandma
elliott
were
in
a
cab
driving
uptown
to
the
wilberforce
grandma
elliott
was
perhaps
the
most
enthusiastic
member
of
the
party
that
good
lady
was
very
fond
of
new
york
city
and
had
the
effect
of
a
patriot
returning
home
after
an
enforced
absence
when
at
last
she
was
ushered
into
the
pretty
apartment
at
the
wilberforce
she
was
more
delighted
than
ever
my
dear
fred
she
exclaimed
what
beautiful
rooms
so
bright
and
sunny
and
such
a
delightful
outlook
across
the
park
i
m
sure
we
shall
be
very
happy
the
rooms
did
look
very
attractive
the
furniture
sent
from
vernondale
had
been
unpacked
and
put
in
place
and
now
it
only
remained
for
patty
to
arrange
the
smaller
trifles
that
were
to
make
the
place
distinctively
to
patty
s
surprise
they
found
awaiting
them
a
large
box
of
chrysanthemums
addressed
to
grandma
and
a
smaller
box
of
carnations
for
patty
these
had
been
sent
as
a
greeting
of
welcome
from
hepworth
how
kind
it
was
of
him
to
send
them
said
patty
as
she
arranged
the
flowers
in
tall
glass
vases
we
ll
keep
these
beautiful
chrysanthemums
in
the
library
and
put
the
pink
carnations
in
the
now
i
ll
put
these
brass
candlesticks
on
the
papa
i
wish
you
d
wind
that
fussy
french
clock
of
yours
for
i
don
t
dare
touch
indeed
you
d
better
not
touch
it
miss
that
clock
insists
on
being
treated
with
the
utmost
deference
and
respect
i
m
afraid
you
d
smash
it
at
the
first
i
dare
say
i
should
i
never
can
make
a
clock
go
now
grandma
can
t
i
help
you
with
your
unpacking
the
three
worked
with
right
and
by
noon
nearly
everything
was
in
place
this
was
fortunate
for
just
as
patty
flung
herself
down
in
an
easy
chair
to
rest
and
to
survey
the
results
of
her
labours
callers
were
announced
these
were
aunt
isabel
clair
and
ethelyn
for
goodness
sake
exclaimed
patty
in
dismay
i
don
t
want
to
see
least
not
just
you
can
t
very
well
help
seeing
them
said
grandma
so
you
may
as
well
look
pleasant
about
it
you
may
show
them
up
she
added
to
the
servant
who
had
brought
the
cards
in
a
few
moments
aunt
isabel
and
ethelyn
came
bustling
in
how
do
you
do
exclaimed
clair
how
perfectly
lovely
to
have
you
here
in
town
and
how
delightful
elliott
that
you
can
be
here
to
take
care
of
our
patty
smiled
at
the
name
which
no
one
ever
called
her
except
the
clair
family
and
aunt
isabel
chattered
on
you
re
looking
well
fred
and
what
lovely
rooms
you
have
i
shall
spend
a
great
deal
of
my
time

shall

when
i
m
in
town
for
the
day
so
shall
i
said
ethelyn
and
i
m
coming
to
stay
a
week
at
a
time
mayn
t
i
patty
i
m
not
sure
about
that
said
fairfield
smiling
kindly
for
you
see
patty
is
going
to
be
very
busy
this
winter
she
s
going
to
school
and
i
want
her
to
study
hard
and
she
is
to
take
music
lessons
so
that
really
she
will
have
little
time
to
oh
are
you
going
to
school
said
ethelyn
in
a
disappointed
tone
i
m
not
going
any
more
mamma
wanted
me
to
but
i
said
i
wouldn
t
i
m
coming
out
this
winter
and
i
m
going
to
have
smashing
good
times
don
t
go
to
school
patty
hasn
t
anything
to
say
about
it
said
patty
s
father
smiling
at
his
daughter
i
want
to
go
anyway
said
patty
i
want
to
learn
things
and
besides
i
think
sixteen
is
too
young
for
a
girl
to
come
much
too
young
said
grandma
elliott
decidedly
patty
is
in
my
charge
this
winter
and
she
is
to
be
a
schoolgirl
and
not
a
young
lady
in
aunt
isabel
sniffed
a
little
and
looked
at
elliott
through
her
but
the
elder
lady
bore
the
scrutiny
calmly
and
only
said
i
hope
patty
will
be
happy
in
spite
of
my
oh
of
course
she
will
and
i
dare
say
you
are
quite
right
said
clair
quickly
for
she
had
no
wish
to
offend
elliott
what
school
are
you
going
to
my
dear
child
i
selected
her
school
said
fairfield
and
i
decided
that
the
oliphant
school
would
be
best
for
and
a
wise
choice
too
said
aunt
isabel
that
s
where
i
wanted
ethelyn
to
go
this
year
the
best
people
in
new
york
patronise
but
they
re
awfully
strict
there
said
ethelyn
they
make
you
study
every
minute
the
lessons
are
awful
hard
and
the
rules
are
something
patty
began
to
look
a
little
serious
at
this
prospect
but
fairfield
said
school
management
that
isn
t
strict
is
no
management
at
all
but
if
patty
gives
this
school
a
fair
trial
and
finds
she
doesn
t
like
it
we
ll
try
to
find
one
that
suits
her
fairfield
invited
the
guests
to
stay
to
luncheon
and
they
willingly
accepted
patty
was
a
little
disappointed
for
though
fond
of
her
aunt
and
cousin
in
some
ways
she
would
have
preferred
not
to
have
them
there
the
first
day
the
clairs
were
very
assertive
people
and
seemed
to
pervade
the
whole
place
they
fluttered
about
from
room
to
room
examining
everything
and
freely
offering
advice
and
criticism
i
will
help
you
select
some
new
clothes
patricia
said
her
aunt
for
i
m
sure
what
you
had
in
vernondale
will
not
be
suitable
for
the
grandma
elliott
looked
dismayed
she
was
of
such
a
gentle
refined
nature
that
she
could
not
quite
bring
herself
to
refuse
clair
s
offer
and
yet
as
she
glanced
at
the
ethelyn
she
was
very
sure
that
she
did
not
wish
patty
similarly
attired
but
fairfield
came
to
her
rescue
thank
you
isabel
he
said
but
you
see
i
m
still
trying
experiments
with
my
daughter
and
this
winter
i
have
put
her
entirely
in
charge
of
elliott
in
every
including
her
millinery
goods
but
come
let
us
all
go
down
to
luncheon
and
we
shall
be
greatly
indebted
to
you
if
you
will
assist
us
in
ordering
as
patty
sometimes
expressed
it
her
father
had
a
happy
faculty
for
offending
people
without
their
knowing
it
and
he
had
changed
the
subject
so
deftly
that
clair
scarcely
realised
that
her
offer
had
been
refused
as
they
went
down
in
the
elevator
and
passed
through
many
beautiful
rooms
on
their
way
to
the
ethelyn
grew
enthusiastic
with
delight
oh
she
whispered
as
she
squeezed
patty
s
arm
it
must
be
just
gorgeous
to
live
here
such
beautiful
rooms
and
such
people
and
servants
all
about
i
should
think
you
would
always
want
to
sit
in
these
i
don
t
said
patty
laughing
i
wouldn
t
know
what
to
do
sitting
up
here
in
state
i
think
our
own
rooms
much
more
pleasant
and
the
too
excited
ethelyn
s
admiration
the
soft
thick
carpets
and
daintily
laid
tables
each
with
its
vase
of
flowers
seemed
suddenly
to
her
far
more
desirable
than
the
in
her
own
home
at
villa
rosa
ethelyn
was
of
an
envious
disposition
and
though
she
was
indulged
and
petted
by
her
parents
she
always
wanted
the
belongings
of
someone
else
she
determined
right
then
and
there
to
coax
her
father
to
close
up
villa
rosa
and
come
to
new
york
for
the
winter
though
she
had
little
hope
that
he
would
do
so
whatever
might
be
aunt
isabel
s
taste
in
buying
clothes
she
certainly
knew
very
well
how
to
order
a
luncheon
and
as
fairfield
put
the
matter
entirely
in
her
hands
a
most
satisfactory
repast
was
the
result
patty
enjoyed
it
all
immensely
and
as
she
looked
around
at
the
people
at
the
other
tables
she
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
all
very
attractive
and
that
her
home
would
be
very
happy
she
was
glad
that
aunt
isabel
and
ethelyn
were
only
temporary
guests
for
patty
could
not
help
noticing
that
clair
though
polite
and
correct
did
not
act
quite
like
grandma
elliott
the
elder
lady
though
equally
sophisticated
had
an
air
of
reserve
and
gentle
dignity
which
seemed
to
patty
far
more
charming
than
aunt
isabel
s
haughty
though
patty
herself
was
inexperienced
she
knew
by
instinct
that
aunt
isabel
laughed
just
a
little
too
loudly
and
expressed
her
opinions
just
a
little
too
frankly
for
a
public
but
clair
had
been
very
kind
to
patty
during
her
visit
the
previous
year
and
too
she
had
as
patty
was
well
aware
some
very
lovable
traits
so
patty
s
sense
of
justice
asserted
itself
and
she
reproached
herself
for
having
criticised
her
aunt
unkindly
even
in
thought
as
the
clairs
were
going
to
a
matinée
they
left
immediately
after
luncheon
and
patty
drew
a
little
sigh
of
relief
after
their
departure
i
like
aunt
isabel
least
of
any
of
my
aunts
papa
she
said
i
don
t
blame
you
much
my
child
isabel
is
but
she
is
a
worldly
woman
and
exceedingly
superficial
your
aunt
alice
is
worth
a
dozen
of
yes
said
patty
and
aunt
grace
is
worth
and
aunt
hester
is
worth
three
or
four
but
she
is
your
aunt
patty
said
grandma
elliott
gently
you
must
remember
that
and
consequently
you
owe
her
respect
and
all
right
grandma
i
ll
pay
her
all
the
respect
and
deference
she
wants
but
i
do
hate
to
have
her
bothering
around
when
we
want
to
get
settled
to
our
housekeeping
but
now
they
ve
gone
and
i
can
have
a
good
long
afternoon
to
straighten
things
all
right
puss
said
her
father
and
i
m
going
out
now
on
some
errands
and
if
you
tuck
grandma
away
for
a
little
nap
which
i
m
quite
sure
she
needs
you
can
have
an
uninterrupted
hour
all
to
beautiful
cried
patty
then
i
can
fix
all
my
books
just
as
i
want
them
and
arrange
my
tea
table
and
and
everything
and
you
ll
bring
me
home
a
box
of
candy
won
t
you
so
we
can
have
a
lovely
cosey
time
this
evening
in
the
bright
lexicon
of
your
youth
a
cosey
time
seems
to
mean
a
box
of
candy
and
a
new
yes
said
patty
i
m
sure
i
don
t
know
anything
cosier
now
run
along
and
come
back
early
and
don
t
forget
the
a
little
fatigued
with
the
unusual
exertions
of
the
day
elliott
went
to
her
room
for
her
nap
and
patty
prepared
to
enjoy
herself
in
her
own
way
she
was
tidy
by
nature
and
really
enjoyed
what
she
called
straightening
out
deciding
upon
the
best
places
for
her
belongings
and
then
arranging
them
in
those
places
proved
an
absorbing
occupation
and
she
spent
the
whole
afternoon
thus
happily
at
work
chapter
iv
lorraine
later
in
the
afternoon
kenneth
harper
called
patty
and
grandma
elliott
were
both
glad
to
see
the
boy
for
though
a
student
at
columbia
college
he
had
visited
much
at
vernondale
and
they
were
both
well
acquainted
with
him
it
s
awfully
jolly
your
being
in
town
this
winter
patty
he
said
and
i
expect
i
ll
bother
you
to
death
running
down
to
see
you
if
i
come
too
often
elliott
you
must
just
put
me
out
without
any
i
ll
remember
that
said
grandma
smiling
and
if
you
appear
more
than
once
a
week
i
shall
give
you
a
gentle
a
hint
will
be
sufficient
ma
am
i
m
not
like
the
man
who
hung
around
until
they
kicked
him
downstairs
he
thought
a
while
and
then
the
situation
dawned
upon
him
i
know
what
they
meant
he
said
they
meant
they
didn
t
want
me
up
there
now
i
m
not
like
that
i
can
catch
on
much
more
patty
and
grandma
laughed
heartily
at
kenneth
s
funny
story
and
then
the
boy
unwrapped
a
parcel
which
he
had
brought
you
see
he
said
i
felt
sure
you
people
would
want
to
do
a
little
light
farming
so
i
brought
you
a
as
he
spoke
he
removed
the
papers
from
a
pretty
which
was
filled
with
several
small
plants
oh
how
nice
cried
patty
clapping
her
hands
i
just
wanted
something
to
take
care
of
you
see
i
can
t
have
a
dog
or
a
cat
or
any
kind
of
an
animal
here
but
i
can
have
plants
one
of
the
girls
gave
me
a
little
fern
but
i
think
it
is
going
to
die
it
s
drooping
like
a
i
rather
think
these
will
die
soon
said
kenneth
cheerfully
but
it
doesn
t
matter
when
they
do
you
can
get
some
more
to
put
a
different
kind
it
s
nice
to
have
a
i
think
they
look
very
thrifty
said
grandma
and
i
m
sure
with
good
care
they
ll
do
perhaps
they
will
ma
am
that
one
in
the
end
is
an
orange
tree
it
may
have
oranges
on
by
yes
if
anybody
ties
them
on
said
patty
laughing
with
kenneth
s
help
they
arranged
the
box
in
the
and
patty
named
it
for
she
said
although
it
doesn
t
really
measure
quite
ten
acres
i
like
a
name
it
gives
you
such
a
feeling
of
and
that
s
a
great
thing
in
new
york
said
kenneth
somehow
i
always
feel
cramped
my
room
is
too
small
there
s
never
any
room
in
the
street
cars
and
even
the
sidewalks
are
well
you
may
come
down
and
roam
around
my
farm
whenever
you
like
said
patty
and
now
don
t
you
think
it
would
be
nice
grandma
if
we
made
a
cup
of
tea
just
to
see
how
the
work
you
grandma
thought
it
would
be
a
very
nice
plan
and
she
rang
for
hot
water
while
patty
hunted
up
the
and
kenneth
filled
the
alcohol
lamp
and
so
when
fairfield
returned
with
the
promised
box
of
candy
he
found
a
merry
of
three
awaiting
him
how
do
you
do
kenneth
my
boy
he
said
cordially
grasping
young
harper
s
hand
i
m
very
well
fairfield
and
delighted
to
welcome
you
and
yours
as
of
our
village
the
last
time
i
saw
you
we
were
all
down
at
the
seashore
do
you
remember
yes
and
a
jolly
time
we
had
down
there
we
must
go
again
next
summer
won
t
you
stay
and
dine
with
us
kenneth
no
thank
you
sir
i
can
t
much
as
i
should
like
to
i
must
go
home
and
dig
up
greek
roots
all
the
you
have
a
farm
too
then
said
grandma
smiling
yes
and
one
that
s
rather
hard
to
till
but
i
suppose
patty
you
ll
be
grubbing
away
at
lessons
next
yes
said
patty
and
i
believe
i
m
not
to
lift
my
eyes
from
my
book
from
monday
morning
till
friday
but
saturdays
said
kenneth
saturday
afternoons
if
we
are
at
home
we
ll
always
be
glad
to
see
you
said
grandma
thank
you
ma
am
i
ll
often
run
down
and
take
my
chances
on
finding
you
i
like
that
young
chap
said
fairfield
after
kenneth
had
gone
and
he
seems
so
alone
here
in
the
city
i
think
we
might
be
a
little
kind
to
him
i
think
so
too
agreed
elliott
cordially
he
s
a
thoroughly
nice
boy
and
i
ve
always
liked
he
a
nice
boy
said
patty
and
how
much
he
looks
like
his
aunt
he
always
makes
me
think
of
miss
the
elders
laughed
at
this
for
miss
daggett
who
had
been
the
fairfields
neighbour
at
vernondale
was
an
elderly
erratic
unamiable
spinster
and
her
nephew
was
a
frank
young
fellow
as
as
he
was
when
came
grandma
told
patty
that
she
might
wear
her
white
cashmere
dress
and
white
this
pleased
patty
very
much
for
it
was
one
of
her
favourite
frocks
and
she
always
enjoyed
wearing
it
though
not
of
dress
patty
had
a
great
liking
for
pretty
things
and
was
also
very
sensitive
to
pleasant
sights
and
sounds
so
the
delighted
her
for
the
was
gaily
lighted
and
decorated
and
musicians
in
a
balcony
played
soft
music
patty
took
her
place
at
their
table
and
being
of
an
adaptable
nature
remarked
that
she
felt
already
quite
at
home
there
i
don
t
know
said
fairfield
it
s
a
little
more
like
a
hotel
than
i
had
anticipated
still
if
we
feel
that
we
re
surrounded
by
too
many
of
our
we
can
have
a
private
oh
no
don
t
do
that
said
patty
i
like
it
better
this
i
like
it
too
said
grandma
elliott
don
t
make
a
change
yet
fred
let
us
try
it
for
a
while
at
very
well
said
fairfield
just
as
you
ladies
say
and
grandma
i
think
that
lady
at
the
next
table
must
know
you
she
s
smiling
at
you
most
elliott
looked
in
the
direction
indicated
why
she
certainly
does
know
me
she
said
bowing
cordially
to
the
lady
in
question
that
is
hamilton
she
s
the
daughter
of
my
old
friend
ellen
howard
and
that
s
her
daughter
sitting
next
her
if
they
re
living
here
patty
you
will
probably
find
lorraine
hamilton
a
pleasant
lorraine
said
patty
what
a
pretty
name
and
she
looks
like
a
nice
girl
after
dinner
our
party
found
hamilton
and
her
daughter
in
the
parlour
and
paused
to
talk
to
them
there
hamilton
was
glad
to
see
elliott
who
had
been
such
a
dear
friend
of
her
mother
s
and
while
they
talked
to
each
other
the
two
girls
sat
down
on
a
sofa
to
become
acquainted
lorraine
hamilton
was
a
girl
of
about
patty
s
own
age
but
while
patty
was
rosy
and
lorraine
was
pale
and
delicate
she
was
very
graceful
and
pretty
with
dark
hair
and
large
dark
eyes
but
she
seemed
listless
and
indifferent
and
patty
who
enjoyed
everything
enthusiastically
wondered
what
could
be
the
matter
with
her
are
you
well
patty
asked
her
bluntly
one
of
patty
s
greatest
faults
was
her
abrupt
manner
of
questioning
people
she
did
not
mean
to
be
rude
but
she
was
by
nature
so
frank
and
straightforward
that
she
often
spoke
in
that
way
without
realising
it
yes
said
lorraine
looking
a
little
surprised
i
m
well
but
i
m
never
very
i
don
t
believe
you
take
exercise
enough
said
patty
still
bluntly
you
don
t
look
as
if
you
i
don
t
take
any
said
lorraine
candidly
that
is
not
if
i
can
help
it
i
walk
to
school
and
back
every
day
but
that
s
only
three
blocks
each
way
and
i
never
go
out
anywhere
but
why
not
asked
patty
in
amazement
because
i
don
t
want
to
i
hate
to
go
out
of
doors
i
like
to
sit
in
the
house
all
the
time
and
read
or
i
like
to
read
too
but
i
like
to
run
out
of
doors
or
walk
or
ride
or
play
tennis
or
skate
or
anything
like
i
don
t
said
lorraine
shortly
she
spoke
so
curtly
that
patty
suddenly
realised
that
perhaps
she
hadn
t
been
very
polite
herself
and
as
she
saw
that
grandma
elliott
and
hamilton
were
still
deeply
absorbed
in
their
conversation
she
felt
that
she
ought
to
try
once
more
to
entertain
this
queer
girl
what
do
you
like
to
read
she
asked
by
way
of
starting
a
subject
poetry
said
lorraine
all
kinds
of
poetry
i
m
going
to
be
a
poet
oh
are
you
said
patty
a
little
awed
by
this
confident
announcement
yes
i
ve
sent
some
poems
to
the
magazines
have
they
been
printed
yet
no
they
weren
t
even
accepted
but
that
doesn
t
discourage
me
poets
never
succeed
at
no
i
suppose
patty
wished
to
be
agreeably
encouraging
but
she
knew
very
little
about
the
experiences
of
young
poets
do
you
live
in
the
wilberforce
she
asked
thinking
it
better
to
get
away
from
the
subject
of
poetry
yes
said
lorraine
we
re
on
the
third
why
so
are
we
how
very
nice
will
you
come
and
see
us
yes
indeed
said
lorraine
i
d
like
to
ever
so
much
we
re
very
lonely
my
father
is
in
the
navy
and
is
away
on
a
three
years
cruise
so
mother
and
i
are
all
i
m
glad
you
re
here
grandma
and
your
mother
can
be
company
for
each
other
and
i
m
sure
you
and
i
will
be
friends
where
do
you
go
to
school
to
the
why
that
s
where
i
m
going
i
start
on
that
s
nice
we
can
go
for
the
first
time
lorraine
seemed
to
show
some
interest
and
animation
and
patty
felt
encouraged
to
believe
that
there
might
be
some
fun
in
this
queer
girl
after
all
tell
me
about
the
school
she
said
well
said
lorraine
it
s
quite
a
big
school
with
lots
of
pupils
and
about
a
dozen
teachers
miss
oliphant
is
the
principal
and
she
s
very
stern
and
strict
miss
fenton
is
and
she
isn
t
a
bit
stern
in
fact
she
s
too
you
can
just
wind
her
around
your
finger
then
the
french
teacher
is
rather
nice
and
miss
rand
the
english
teacher
is
tell
me
about
the
girls
said
patty
oh
there
are
all
sorts
there
are
the
grubbing
girls
that
just
study
and
dig
all
the
time
and
the
silly
girls
who
never
study
at
all
then
there
is
a
set
of
snobbish
girls
who
stick
up
their
noses
at
anybody
who
isn
t
a
the
girls
don
t
sound
very
nice
as
you
describe
them
said
patty
no
they
re
not
very
nice
i
don
t
know
a
girl
i
really
like
in
the
whole
that
sounds
cheerful
said
patty
laughing
i
think
i
ll
enjoy
a
school
made
up
of
girls
like
that
do
you
suppose
they
ll
like
me
i
don
t
know
said
lorraine
looking
uninterested
they
don
t
like
patty
felt
like
saying
i
shouldn
t
think
they
would
but
she
politely
refrained
and
just
then
the
elder
ladies
called
them
to
go
upstairs
well
said
patty
as
she
was
alone
with
her
family
once
more
that
hamilton
girl
is
the
queerest
thing
i
ever
saw
she
didn
t
have
a
good
word
to
say
about
anybody
or
anything
and
she
doesn
t
seem
to
have
a
joy
in
life
such
a
lackadaisical
looking
thing
as
she
is
i
m
sorry
for
perhaps
you
can
cheer
her
up
patty
girl
said
her
father
you
have
joy
and
enough
for
two
i
m
sure
can
t
you
give
her
a
little
it
would
be
fun
to
try
said
patty
smiling
at
the
idea
perhaps
i
can
transform
her
into
a
gay
jolly
little
they
all
laughed
at
the
notion
of
the
pale
lorraine
being
gay
or
jolly
but
patty
was
more
in
earnest
than
they
thought
and
she
said
i
really
am
going
to
try
for
i
think
it
s
my
duty
and
besides
i
can
t
stand
seeing
such
a
thing
do
try
patty
said
grandma
gently
and
i
hope
you
will
succeed
you
will
have
ample
opportunity
for
i
have
invited
hamilton
to
come
and
see
us
and
to
bring
all
right
grandma
said
patty
cheerily
i
ll
do
my
chapter
v
a
new
school
i
am
so
glad
said
patty
as
they
sat
at
breakfast
monday
morning
that
lorraine
hamilton
goes
to
the
oliphant
school
it
s
so
much
nicer
to
have
somebody
to
go
with
than
to
go
alone
among
a
lot
of
strange
you
ll
soon
get
acquainted
said
her
father
and
you
ll
probably
grow
to
love
your
school
so
much
that
you
ll
be
restless
and
impatient
during
the
hours
you
will
have
to
spend
at
this
was
a
great
joke
for
patty
s
aversion
to
school
and
lessons
was
well
known
indeed
i
won
t
she
exclaimed
i
just
hate
school
and
always
shall
of
course
i
want
to
learn
things
but
i
d
rather
sit
at
home
and
read
them
myself
out
of
it
does
seem
too
bad
said
her
father
that
you
can
t
have
your
own
way
in
this
matter
but
you
just
can
t
your
cruel
tyrant
of
a
parent
ordains
that
you
must
go
to
school
for
a
year
at
least
but
if
you
study
hard
and
learn
a
lot
during
that
year
perhaps
next
year
he
ll
let
you
stay
at
well
said
patty
resignedly
i
ll
go
this
year
then
because
i
don
t
see
as
i
can
help
myself
and
i
ll
just
study
and
cram
all
the
time
so
i
won
t
have
to
go
next
i
wish
you
were
more
studious
patty
said
grandma
i
wish
so
too
grandma
said
patty
but
i
m
not
and
never
will
be
so
you
ll
have
to
take
me
just
as
i
am
and
make
the
best
of
the
school
was
only
three
blocks
away
and
patty
and
lorraine
started
off
together
it
was
not
a
very
cheerful
walk
for
lorraine
wore
her
usual
air
of
glum
despondency
and
patty
felt
so
far
from
gay
herself
that
she
didn
t
even
try
to
cheer
up
her
companion
the
school
term
had
opened
a
week
before
but
fairfield
had
arranged
with
miss
oliphant
for
patty
to
go
right
to
her
classes
immediately
upon
her
arrival
patty
had
never
seen
the
school
or
the
teachers
and
lorraine
s
account
of
them
had
not
sounded
at
all
attractive
let
me
sit
by
you
lorraine
mayn
t
i
patty
said
as
they
neared
the
school
yes
indeed
said
lorraine
i
ll
be
glad
to
have
you
nobody
ever
wants
to
sit
by
me
perhaps
we
can
t
be
together
in
all
our
classes
but
the
opening
exercises
are
held
in
the
big
and
we
can
sit
together
all
right
said
patty
who
somehow
had
an
unaccountable
feeling
of
loneliness
at
thought
of
the
strange
school
she
knew
she
was
foolish
and
she
tried
hard
to
overcome
it
yet
she
couldn
t
help
wishing
herself
back
in
vernondale
the
oliphant
school
was
a
large
and
handsome
building
well
equipped
after
the
most
modern
fashion
miss
oliphant
herself
received
patty
and
welcomed
her
politely
though
without
cordiality
indeed
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
imagine
miss
oliphant
showing
cordiality
she
was
a
most
dignified
and
personage
she
held
her
head
very
high
and
her
cold
grey
eyes
seemed
to
look
right
through
patty
and
read
her
very
thoughts
but
if
miss
oliphant
did
observe
patty
s
dejection
she
certainly
made
no
effort
to
allay
it
i
am
glad
to
see
you
she
said
but
her
formal
handshake
and
conventional
smile
did
not
seem
to
corroborate
her
words
you
will
take
your
place
with
the
rest
in
the
and
after
the
opening
exercises
of
the
morning
you
will
be
assigned
to
your
this
was
followed
by
a
gesture
of
dismissal
but
patty
paused
long
enough
to
ask
may
i
sit
next
to
lorraine
hamilton
an
expression
of
surprise
passed
over
miss
oliphant
s
face
but
she
only
said
certainly
if
you
wish
to
and
then
patty
rejoined
lorraine
in
the
hall
and
together
they
went
to
the
as
it
was
already
time
for
school
to
open
patty
had
no
opportunity
to
be
introduced
to
any
of
her
she
looked
at
them
however
with
a
good
deal
of
interest
and
decided
that
notwithstanding
lorraine
s
opinion
of
them
they
looked
like
very
nice
girls
two
or
three
in
particular
she
picked
out
as
looking
interesting
and
one
girl
she
felt
sure
would
be
especially
friendly
she
even
smiled
pleasantly
at
this
girl
but
to
her
surprise
her
smile
was
not
cordially
returned
the
girl
acknowledged
it
by
a
mere
nod
and
looked
away
patty
felt
a
little
embarrassed
and
concluded
that
city
girls
were
horrid
things
and
she
longed
for
her
merry
companions
at
the
vernondale
school
several
times
she
found
herself
gazing
intently
at
one
or
another
of
the
pupils
but
invariably
her
look
was
returned
by
a
cold
stare
or
ignored
entirely
i
m
perfectly
silly
to
think
anything
about
it
thought
patty
to
herself
it
s
just
their
way
of
not
recognising
anybody
until
they
ve
been
formally
introduced
they
ll
be
all
right
after
i
ve
really
met
them
i
ve
never
been
foolishly
sensitive
before
and
i
m
not
going
to
begin
so
patty
bravely
put
out
of
her
mind
all
thoughts
of
the
girls
apparent
attitude
toward
her
and
turned
her
attention
to
her
school
duties
she
was
glad
to
find
that
in
most
of
her
studies
she
was
in
the
class
with
lorraine
and
consequently
was
able
to
sit
by
her
all
through
the
morning
the
oliphant
school
was
attended
by
both
boarding
pupils
and
day
pupils
and
at
noon
a
hot
luncheon
was
served
for
all
after
the
morning
lessons
were
over
the
girls
gathered
in
groups
chatting
gaily
while
they
awaited
the
summons
to
the
patty
supposed
of
course
that
at
this
time
lorraine
would
introduce
her
to
the
girls
but
she
was
disappointed
the
two
stood
together
alone
and
lorraine
made
no
suggestion
of
joining
any
of
the
others
neither
did
she
exert
herself
to
entertain
patty
but
stood
morose
and
glum
looking
out
of
a
window
annoyed
by
what
she
chose
to
consider
lorraine
s
rudeness
patty
determined
to
make
her
own
way
and
walking
across
the
room
to
where
the
girl
was
standing
she
said
i
m
a
new
pupil
and
i
feel
very
lonely
mayn
t
i
join
this
group
and
begin
to
get
acquainted
my
name
is
patty
mine
is
clementine
morse
said
the
girl
she
addressed
and
this
is
maude
carleton
and
this
is
adelaide
the
girls
nodded
as
their
names
were
mentioned
but
paid
no
further
attention
to
patty
maude
and
adelaide
began
to
talk
to
each
other
about
their
own
affairs
but
clementine
opened
a
conversation
with
patty
you
re
a
day
pupil
i
suppose
she
said
are
you
a
friend
of
lorraine
hamilton
yes
said
patty
she
s
the
only
girl
i
know
here
she
lives
in
the
same
hotel
i
do
and
we
came
together
this
morning
she
s
in
most
of
my
classes
you
re
not
are
you
at
least
i
didn
t
see
you
in
the
classroom
this
no
said
clementine
laughing
i
m
below
you
in
everything
i
m
only
one
of
the
gigs
exclaimed
patty
what
in
the
world
are
they
why
you
see
explained
clementine
the
oliphant
school
like
gaul
is
divided
into
three
parts
the
girls
are
all
either
prigs
or
digs
or
tell
me
about
them
said
patty
much
interested
well
the
prigs
are
a
lot
of
girls
who
never
do
anything
wrong
they
re
awfully
and
most
fearfully
correct
in
their
deportment
they
re
on
the
privileged
roll
all
the
time
they
don
t
study
so
very
much
but
they
re
great
on
etiquette
and
manners
then
the
digs
are
the
girls
who
study
like
fury
they
re
like
kipling
s
rhinoceros
they
never
had
any
manners
then
since
or
henceforward
but
they
re
most
astonishing
wise
and
learned
you
can
tell
them
by
their
looks
they
wear
two
wrinkles
over
their
nose
and
a
pair
of
glasses
then
the
gigs
are
my
sort
we
giggle
all
the
time
never
study
if
we
can
help
it
and
are
continually
being
punished
for
the
fun
we
have
which
do
you
think
you
ll
be
i
don
t
know
said
patty
smiling
i
hate
to
study
so
i
don
t
believe
i
can
be
a
dig
i
m
sure
i
haven
t
manners
enough
to
be
a
prig
and
somehow
i
don
t
feel
jolly
enough
to
be
a
gig
which
is
lorraine
she
isn
t
any
of
them
said
clementine
i
don
t
believe
anybody
could
classify
just
then
luncheon
was
announced
and
the
girls
all
went
to
the
patty
sat
next
to
lorraine
and
was
disappointed
to
see
that
clementine
was
at
another
table
the
was
very
pleasant
and
the
small
tables
were
daintily
appointed
eight
girls
sat
at
each
table
and
though
lorraine
introduced
patty
to
her
after
a
few
perfunctory
sentences
to
her
they
began
to
chat
together
about
matters
of
which
patty
knew
nothing
poor
patty
s
spirits
sank
lower
and
lower
the
girls
were
not
actually
rude
to
her
they
merely
seemed
to
take
no
interest
in
her
and
had
no
wish
to
become
better
acquainted
this
was
decidedly
a
new
experience
for
patty
all
her
life
she
had
been
liked
by
her
companions
in
vernondale
she
had
been
the
favourite
of
the
whole
school
and
even
when
she
went
to
school
in
boston
the
girls
though
less
enthusiastic
had
all
been
pleasant
and
kind
she
couldn
t
understand
it
at
all
but
with
her
usual
philosophic
acceptance
of
the
inevitable
she
concluded
that
it
was
the
custom
of
new
york
girls
to
treat
strangers
coolly
and
she
might
as
well
get
used
to
it
so
assuming
a
cheerfulness
which
she
was
far
from
feeling
she
addressed
herself
to
lorraine
and
tried
to
keep
up
a
conversation
but
that
depressed
piece
of
humanity
was
even
more
like
a
wet
blanket
than
usual
and
patty
was
forced
to
give
it
up
in
despair
she
looked
around
the
and
couldn
t
help
noticing
that
the
group
at
each
table
were
chatting
merrily
and
that
nowhere
else
did
there
seem
to
be
a
stranger
like
herself
after
luncheon
there
were
still
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
before
class
time
again
patty
determined
to
do
her
part
toward
bringing
about
a
pleasanter
condition
of
affairs
selecting
another
girl
patty
asked
lorraine
to
introduce
her
why
that
s
gertrude
lyons
said
lorraine
in
astonishment
i
don
t
care
if
it
s
gertrude
bears
or
gertrude
wild
tigers
said
patty
i
want
you
to
introduce
me
will
you
certainly
said
lorraine
staring
at
patty
come
in
a
way
lorraine
presented
patty
to
gertrude
lyons
and
in
a
wholly
rude
way
gertrude
stared
at
them
both
how
do
you
do
she
said
coldly
to
patty
is
this
your
first
day
here
yes
said
patty
determined
to
be
friendly
in
spite
of
gertrude
s
repelling
air
and
i
think
i
shall
like
it
after
i
get
better
acquainted
with
you
all
it
seems
a
little
strange
at
where
do
you
live
asked
gertrude
abruptly
at
the
wilberforce
where
lorraine
how
long
have
you
lived
there
only
two
days
said
patty
smiling
but
i
m
already
beginning
to
feel
quite
at
home
where
did
you
live
before
in
vernondale
new
oh
said
gertrude
and
then
as
another
girl
came
up
to
speak
to
her
the
two
walked
away
without
a
further
word
to
patty
this
was
a
little
too
much
patty
s
face
grew
crimson
and
she
turned
to
lorraine
with
a
look
of
angry
surprise
i
knew
you
wouldn
t
like
her
said
lorraine
in
a
dull
careless
tone
but
you
insisted
on
being
introduced
she
s
one
of
the
prigs
and
the
priggiest
one
of
them
all
she
won
t
speak
to
a
girl
unless
she
lives
on
fifth
avenue
and
keeps
leven
well
i
think
she
s
just
as
rude
as
she
can
be
said
patty
she
isn
t
half
as
nice
as
she
oh
she
snubbed
you
because
you
owned
up
that
you
came
from
the
country
if
you
want
the
prigs
to
like
you
don
t
tell
them
you
came
from
new
new
jersey
is
just
as
good
as
new
york
said
patty
growing
indignant
and
the
girls
there
are
a
great
deal
nicer
and
have
better
manners
than
the
girls
at
this
school
i
think
clementine
morse
is
nice
though
she
added
her
sense
of
justice
asserting
itself
i
don
t
said
lorraine
calmly
i
don
t
like
any
of
with
a
heavy
heart
patty
went
to
her
afternoon
classes
the
outlook
was
not
encouraging
school
life
was
none
too
pleasant
at
best
but
school
life
with
a
lot
of
hateful
disagreeable
girls
promised
to
be
nothing
short
of
misery
patty
drew
a
long
breath
when
the
lessons
were
over
for
the
day
and
walked
home
with
lorraine
in
no
more
cheerful
frame
of
mind
than
her
companion
chapter
vi
the
reason
why
when
patty
reached
home
she
flung
herself
into
the
library
like
a
small
whirlwind
it
s
just
awful
grandma
she
exclaimed
throwing
herself
into
a
big
armchair
with
absolute
despair
written
on
her
face
it
s
a
horrid
school
and
i
wish
i
didn
t
have
to
go
to
it
the
girls
are
snippy
and
rude
and
disagreeable
they
don
t
like
me
and
i
don
t
like
them
and
won
t
you
help
me
to
coax
papa
not
to
make
me
go
there
any
more
i
d
rather
have
a
governess
or
anything
tell
me
all
about
it
dear
said
grandma
as
she
quietly
took
patty
s
hat
and
gloves
away
from
the
excited
child
why
they
just
snubbed
me
right
and
left
and
lorraine
says
it
s
because
i
came
from
the
country
did
you
ever
hear
such
foolishness
i
certainly
never
did
said
grandma
smiling
in
spite
of
the
seriousness
of
the
occasion
you
are
not
a
new
york
girl
but
you
are
not
countrified
enough
to
be
a
subject
of
ridicule
weren
t
any
of
the
girls
nice
to
you
only
one
and
she
wasn
t
anything
to
brag
of
her
name
is
clementine
morse
and
she
s
awfully
pretty
and
but
i
didn
t
see
much
of
her
she
was
pleasant
but
she
seemed
to
be
so
more
from
a
sense
of
duty
than
because
she
really
liked
i
don
t
understand
it
said
grandma
think
you
re
a
very
nice
girl
and
i
don
t
see
why
anyone
should
think
well
they
do
said
patty
but
never
mind
i
m
not
going
to
think
anything
more
about
it
until
papa
comes
home
and
then
i
m
going
to
ask
him
not
to
make
me
go
there
any
as
grandma
elliott
was
a
wise
old
lady
she
refrained
from
further
questions
and
dropped
the
subject
entirely
she
proposed
to
patty
that
they
should
go
out
and
do
a
little
shopping
and
get
some
fresh
air
and
exercise
this
proved
a
most
successful
diversion
and
soon
patty
was
her
own
merry
bright
self
again
but
when
fairfield
came
home
at
five
o
clock
patty
laid
the
case
before
him
in
emphatic
and
graphic
language
they
re
different
kinds
of
horrid
she
said
in
conclusion
but
they
re
horrid
only
a
few
of
them
were
really
rude
but
they
all
ignored
me
and
seemed
to
wish
that
i
d
get
off
the
how
did
you
treat
them
asked
her
father
who
was
really
puzzled
at
the
turn
affairs
had
taken
why
i
did
the
best
i
knew
how
i
waited
for
them
to
be
nice
to
me
and
then
when
they
didn
t
i
tried
to
be
nice
to
them
but
they
wouldn
t
let
me
of
course
papa
you
know
i
know
enough
not
to
be
forward
or
push
myself
in
where
i
m
not
wanted
but
i
just
tried
to
get
acquainted
in
a
nice
way
and
they
wouldn
t
have
it
at
i
can
t
see
through
it
puss
it
s
really
most
extraordinary
but
i
can
t
believe
they
don
t
like
you
a
nice
pretty
little
girl
like
you
ought
to
make
friends
at
first
sight
and
you
always
have
done
i
know
it
papa
i
never
had
anybody
act
like
this
before
please
say
i
needn
t
go
any
patty
my
dear
child
i
can
t
consent
to
take
you
away
from
the
school
at
once
though
i
am
very
very
sorry
for
you
the
whole
thing
seems
so
strange
and
i
can
t
believe
but
that
it
will
straighten
itself
out
in
a
day
or
two
now
i
ll
tell
you
what
we
ll
do
if
you
ll
go
to
school
the
remainder
of
this
week
and
try
your
best
to
do
your
part
toward
bringing
about
a
better
understanding
i
ll
promise
you
that
if
you
don
t
succeed
by
the
end
of
the
week
you
needn
t
return
next
monday
i
know
it
will
be
hard
for
you
but
i
think
it
only
just
to
give
the
school
a
fair
trial
and
i
don
t
want
you
to
decide
after
only
one
day
s
patty
looked
disappointed
but
she
had
a
brave
heart
and
too
she
had
implicit
confidence
in
her
father
s
judgment
all
right
papa
she
said
i
ll
do
it
i
hate
like
fury
to
go
back
there
but
i
will
and
i
ll
do
my
part
too
i
ll
try
my
very
best
to
make
the
girls
like
me
but
if
they
don
t
act
differently
by
friday
i
ll
give
up
the
that
s
my
own
brave
girl
and
truly
patty
i
believe
it
will
be
all
right
in
a
day
or
two
it
s
preposterous
to
think
that
a
lot
of
schoolgirls
should
unanimously
agree
to
dislike
you
i
m
sure
there
is
some
explanation
either
you
exaggerate
their
natural
hesitation
toward
a
comparative
stranger
or
else
there
is
a
serious
misunderstanding
then
you
don
t
think
it
s
because
i
came
from
the
country
papa
nonsense
you
weren
t
brought
up
in
the
back
woods
vernondale
is
too
near
new
york
to
be
as
countrified
as
all
that
i
don
t
suppose
you
talked
bad
grammar
or
displayed
uncouth
no
said
patty
smiling
i
tried
to
behave
like
a
little
lady
but
apparently
i
didn
t
well
don
t
think
another
thing
about
it
said
her
father
just
go
right
along
every
day
this
week
and
if
you
don
t
want
to
because
want
you
to
clinch
your
hands
and
grit
your
teeth
if
necessary
but
march
along
each
day
like
my
brave
little
soldier
and
somehow
i
think
we
ll
conquer
in
the
long
patty
had
inherited
a
good
deal
of
the
fairfield
pluck
and
she
caught
the
spirit
of
her
father
s
advice
i
ll
do
it
she
said
determinedly
i
ll
try
as
hard
as
i
can
to
win
but
i
don
t
see
much
never
mind
the
hope
just
go
ahead
with
your
efforts
and
let
the
results
take
care
of
themselves
and
now
let
us
go
down
and
have
an
especially
nice
dinner
to
restore
us
after
this
when
they
entered
the
patty
was
surprised
to
see
adelaide
hart
at
one
of
the
tables
patty
bowed
cordially
as
she
passed
her
but
adelaide
returned
it
without
enthusiasm
fortified
by
her
talk
with
her
father
patty
determined
not
to
mind
this
and
passed
on
with
a
heightened
colour
she
did
not
tell
her
father
about
adelaide
for
she
had
resolved
to
fight
her
own
battles
through
the
week
the
dinner
was
very
pleasant
fairfield
was
merry
and
entertaining
grandma
was
very
sweet
and
comforting
and
patty
began
to
feel
as
if
life
were
worth
living
after
all
after
dinner
they
joined
the
hamiltons
in
the
parlour
and
patty
and
lorraine
talked
over
the
events
of
the
day
i
thought
you
wouldn
t
like
the
girls
said
lorraine
i
don
t
like
them
either
and
they
don
t
like
i
saw
adelaide
hart
in
the
said
patty
does
she
live
here
yes
they
re
on
the
fourth
floor
that
was
her
father
and
mother
at
the
table
with
her
and
her
two
sisters
they
re
awfully
disagreeable
girls
i
don
t
speak
to
patty
was
more
puzzled
than
ever
adelaide
hart
looked
like
a
nice
girl
but
she
certainly
had
not
treated
patty
nicely
and
lorraine
had
evidently
noticed
it
the
second
day
at
school
was
much
like
the
first
the
girls
made
no
advances
and
when
patty
tried
to
be
sociable
although
not
actually
rude
they
did
not
encourage
her
and
made
use
of
the
slightest
pretext
to
get
away
from
her
this
left
patty
entirely
dependent
on
the
society
of
lorraine
and
so
the
two
were
constantly
together
the
third
day
brought
no
change
for
the
better
and
patty
s
pride
began
to
assert
itself
what
the
reason
could
be
she
had
no
idea
but
she
was
certain
now
that
the
girls
avoided
her
for
some
definite
reason
and
as
she
was
innocent
of
any
intentional
offence
she
deeply
resented
it
she
learned
her
lessons
went
to
the
various
classrooms
and
recited
them
and
was
generally
commended
by
the
teachers
for
her
studiousness
and
good
deportment
by
thursday
she
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
no
hope
of
making
friends
with
any
of
her
schoolmates
and
with
this
conviction
she
practically
gave
up
the
struggle
to
hide
her
defeat
she
unconsciously
assumed
a
more
haughty
air
and
herself
ignored
the
very
girls
who
had
neglected
her
on
thursday
afternoon
the
whole
school
went
for
a
walk
in
central
park
as
was
the
custom
on
stated
occasions
clementine
morse
asked
patty
to
walk
with
her
this
was
a
distinct
advance
and
patty
would
have
welcomed
it
joyfully
earlier
in
the
week
but
it
came
too
late
and
though
patty
really
wanted
to
go
with
clementine
her
outraged
pride
and
growing
resentment
forced
her
to
refuse
and
she
answered
coldly
thank
you
but
i
m
going
to
walk
with
thursday
night
fairfield
asked
patty
how
the
experiment
was
succeeding
they
had
not
discussed
the
matter
much
through
the
week
but
fairfield
had
gathered
a
pretty
accurate
knowledge
of
the
state
of
affairs
from
patty
s
demeanour
there
s
no
hope
said
patty
at
least
clementine
morse
did
ask
me
to
walk
with
her
but
after
her
coolness
all
the
week
i
wasn
t
going
to
do
revenge
is
so
sweet
said
fairfield
looking
at
the
ceiling
but
with
a
quizzical
expression
in
his
eyes
i
hope
you
thoroughly
enjoyed
refusing
her
now
papa
you
re
sarcastic
said
patty
but
i
just
guess
wouldn
t
go
walking
with
people
who
had
snubbed
you
right
and
left
for
four
days
it
hard
lines
my
girl
and
you
must
use
your
own
judgment
but
don
t
be
a
brave
and
plucky
soldier
all
through
the
week
only
to
be
conquered
by
a
mean
little
spirit
of
retaliation
at
patty
thought
this
over
pretty
thoroughly
as
she
always
thought
over
her
father
s
advice
and
she
went
to
school
friday
morning
resolved
to
be
magnanimous
should
any
opportunity
present
itself
friday
was
the
day
for
the
gymnasium
class
this
was
a
novelty
to
patty
and
she
greatly
enjoyed
it
for
she
was
fond
of
physical
exercise
lorraine
did
not
attend
gymnasium
for
as
she
had
said
she
hated
exercise
of
any
kind
and
the
class
was
not
compulsory
but
clementine
was
there
and
as
the
girls
stood
or
sat
around
resting
after
some
calisthenics
she
came
over
to
patty
you
re
fond
of
this
sort
of
thing
aren
t
you
she
said
with
such
frank
that
patty
responded
at
once
yes
i
love
it
i
love
any
kind
of
vigorous
exercise
rowing
or
swimming
or
games
i
like
the
best
but
this
is
splendid
fun
i
ve
never
been
in
a
gymnasium
haven
t
you
you
take
to
it
all
so
readily
i
thought
you
knew
all
about
it
you
ll
like
the
we
ll
have
that
next
i
won
t
be
here
next
patty
said
this
involuntarily
she
had
not
meant
to
announce
it
so
abruptly
but
she
spoke
before
she
thought
why
not
exclaimed
clementine
looking
dismayed
don
t
you
like
the
school
no
said
patty
feeling
suddenly
an
irresistible
desire
to
probe
the
mystery
don
t
i
suppose
it
s
my
own
fault
but
if
so
i
don
t
know
why
none
of
the
girls
like
me
they
will
scarcely
speak
to
me
and
i
m
not
accustomed
to
being
treated
that
patty
s
voice
trembled
a
little
and
a
suggestion
of
tears
came
into
her
blue
eyes
but
she
stood
her
ground
bravely
for
she
was
not
whining
and
she
knew
it
but
she
felt
that
the
time
had
come
for
an
explanation
my
goodness
gracious
exclaimed
clementine
don
t
you
know
why
the
girls
don
t
chum
with
you
no
said
patty
her
amazement
and
curiosity
rising
above
all
other
sentiments
and
if
you
know
i
wish
for
pity
s
sake
you
d
tell
why
said
clementine
it
s
only
because
you
re
such
an
inseparable
chum
of
lorraine
hamilton
s
the
girls
can
t
bear
her
she
is
so
disagreeable
and
doleful
and
generally
unpleasant
we
ve
tried
our
best
she
s
been
here
two
years
you
know
but
we
simply
like
her
and
so
when
you
came
with
her
and
seemed
to
be
such
a
desperate
friend
of
hers
why
of
course
we
couldn
t
take
you
up
without
taking
her
too
and
too
we
thought
that
since
you
were
so
terribly
intimate
with
her
you
probably
weren
t
any
nicer
than
she
is
but
i
soon
came
to
the
conclusion
that
you
weren
t
a
bit
like
her
and
i
want
awfully
to
be
friends
with
you
and
so
do
lots
of
the
other
girls
but
when
i
asked
you
to
walk
with
me
yesterday
you
said
no
you
d
rather
walk
with
lorraine
and
i
felt
myself
decidedly
out
of
i
m
sorry
about
that
said
patty
impulsively
i
was
horrid
i
know
but
you
see
i
had
felt
so
lonely
and
neglected
all
the
week
that
somehow
yesterday
i
got
my
spunk
up
and
i
just
felt
like
hurting
somebody
to
make
up
for
the
way
they
had
hurt
me
i
was
awfully
sorry
about
it
oh
that
s
all
right
said
clementine
don
t
think
of
it
again
and
don
t
leave
the
school
will
you
try
it
another
week
anyhow
i
m
sure
you
ll
like
it
when
you
get
started
i
think
i
shall
said
patty
anyway
i
ll
try
it
one
week
more
i
m
not
a
baby
you
know
but
it
yes
i
know
but
just
you
wait
until
next
week
and
chapter
vii
some
new
friends
well
patty
said
fairfield
as
they
sat
in
their
pleasant
library
waiting
for
the
week
is
up
and
i
suppose
you
have
shaken
the
dust
of
the
oliphant
school
off
of
your
feet
for
the
last
that
s
where
you
re
wrong
man
said
patty
smiling
i
ve
decided
to
try
it
for
another
that
s
pretty
good
news
and
what
brought
about
this
sudden
change
of
base
why
papa
the
whole
trouble
in
a
nutshell
is
why
you
don
t
mean
she
s
set
the
girls
against
you
not
purposely
indeed
i
don
t
even
suppose
she
knows
it
herself
but
the
real
reason
the
girls
didn
t
want
to
get
acquainted
with
me
was
because
they
thought
that
as
i
was
always
with
lorraine
and
seemed
so
intimate
with
her
i
must
be
just
like
her
and
do
you
know
they
can
t
abide
lorraine
and
papa
she
yes
she
is
it
s
a
pity
but
really
i
can
t
blame
anybody
for
not
liking
that
doleful
little
piece
of
and
it
isn
t
only
her
dolefulness
but
she
seems
disagreeable
by
nature
you
know
i
told
you
i
d
try
to
cheer
her
up
and
i
have
but
gracious
you
might
as
well
try
to
amuse
a
i
never
saw
such
a
girl
it
s
true
said
grandma
i
m
so
surprised
and
disappointed
that
ellen
howard
s
should
turn
out
like
that
hamilton
is
always
cheerful
and
pleasant
but
lorraine
isn
t
one
bit
like
her
at
first
i
was
sorry
for
the
girl
but
now
i
feel
indignant
with
her
i
know
she
could
be
different
if
she
but
seriously
patty
said
fairfield
did
the
schoolgirls
boycott
you
because
you
were
friendly
with
lorraine
yes
exactly
that
papa
you
see
i
was
more
than
friendly
we
were
was
with
her
all
the
time
of
course
the
reason
was
that
i
hadn
t
anyone
else
to
go
with
but
the
girls
didn
t
understand
that
they
thought
i
tarred
with
the
same
brush
suggested
fairfield
well
you
re
not
you
re
a
ray
of
sunshine
compared
to
that
murky
and
it
s
outrageous
that
you
should
be
punished
for
her
faults
how
did
you
find
all
this
out
clementine
morse
told
me
and
she
says
if
i
ll
drop
lorraine
the
rest
of
the
girls
are
more
than
willing
to
be
chummy
and
nice
but
papa
it
doesn
t
seem
right
to
drop
lorraine
like
that
and
i
don
t
know
what
to
it
is
an
awkward
situation
i
admit
but
justice
demands
that
your
welfare
should
be
considered
as
well
as
hers
now
look
at
it
squarely
and
fairly
you
ve
devoted
this
whole
week
to
lorraine
and
apparently
it
hasn
t
done
her
one
bit
of
good
and
it
has
done
you
harm
and
supposing
you
were
to
keep
on
in
that
way
what
would
be
the
result
i
don
t
believe
it
would
be
a
bit
different
said
patty
honestly
she
s
been
at
the
school
two
years
before
this
and
clementine
says
that
they
ve
all
tried
to
make
her
more
jolly
and
sociable
but
they
couldn
t
do
it
so
they
finally
gave
it
it
s
an
unusual
case
and
a
very
unfortunate
one
said
fairfield
seriously
but
though
lorraine
isn
t
pleasant
and
companionable
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
sacrifice
yourself
for
her
but
what
can
i
do
lorraine
is
right
here
in
the
house
and
i
have
to
walk
to
school
and
back
with
her
and
i
don
t
want
to
be
mean
to
your
own
tact
must
manage
that
patty
said
grandma
in
her
decided
way
patty
had
often
noticed
that
when
grandma
elliott
gave
advice
it
was
good
advice
and
very
much
to
the
point
so
she
listened
with
interest
as
grandma
went
on
you
needn
t
cut
lorraine
or
drop
her
friendship
entirely
but
you
can
certainly
be
friends
with
the
other
girls
even
though
she
is
not
when
they
invite
you
or
give
you
an
opportunity
to
join
their
pleasures
give
lorraine
a
fair
chance
too
and
if
she
isn
t
capable
of
taking
advantage
of
it
let
her
alone
you
have
done
your
part
and
are
no
further
responsible
of
course
you
understand
that
this
is
not
to
be
said
in
so
many
words
but
i
know
your
sense
of
honour
and
justice
and
your
kind
heart
will
make
it
possible
for
you
to
manage
it
tactfully
and
that
s
exactly
right
said
fairfield
grandma
has
expressed
in
words
just
what
i
had
in
mind
now
go
ahead
chicken
do
all
you
can
for
lorraine
but
not
to
the
extent
of
injuring
your
own
standing
among
those
whom
you
have
every
reason
to
wish
to
please
and
i
think
after
a
week
or
two
matters
will
adjust
themselves
and
you
will
fall
naturally
into
the
right
groove
you
have
had
an
unpleasant
experience
but
i
think
it
will
come
out
right
yet
and
perhaps
in
the
long
run
you
may
be
able
to
help
lorraine
after
you
are
the
dearest
people
cried
patty
flinging
one
arm
around
her
father
s
neck
while
with
the
other
hand
she
patted
grandma
s
pretty
white
hair
any
girl
ought
to
be
good
and
nice
with
such
helpers
and
advisers
as
you
two
i
m
sure
it
will
all
come
out
right
and
i
m
as
happy
as
a
clam
now
it
s
been
a
horrid
week
but
we
won
t
think
about
that
any
more
and
i
know
next
week
will
be
that
s
the
way
to
talk
said
her
father
forget
the
unpleasant
things
that
happen
and
think
only
about
the
happy
ones
i
believe
that
remark
or
something
similar
has
been
made
before
but
it
s
just
as
true
as
if
it
hadn
t
been
and
now
the
affairs
of
state
being
settled
i
d
like
to
have
some
as
they
went
down
in
the
elevator
they
met
lorraine
and
her
mother
how
nice
you
look
said
patty
glancing
at
a
pretty
new
frock
the
girl
was
wearing
oh
i
think
it
s
horrid
said
lorraine
fretfully
it
s
such
an
ugly
shade
of
blue
and
the
sleeves
are
too
now
you
see
how
it
is
papa
said
patty
a
few
moments
later
as
they
seated
themselves
at
their
own
table
you
heard
what
lorraine
said
about
her
dress
and
that
s
just
the
way
she
always
is
nothing
pleases
bad
case
of
chronic
discontent
said
fairfield
and
i
fear
incurable
i
m
glad
you
are
not
like
after
dinner
as
they
often
did
they
paused
for
a
few
moments
in
the
attractive
hotel
library
in
a
few
moments
the
harts
came
in
and
adelaide
went
directly
up
to
patty
and
said
won
t
you
come
and
talk
to
us
a
little
while
i
want
you
to
meet
my
patty
was
quite
ready
to
meet
this
cordiality
and
mutual
introductions
all
around
were
the
result
hart
and
fairfield
soon
hit
upon
congenial
topics
for
conversation
and
hart
proved
pleasantly
entertaining
to
grandma
elliott
this
left
the
young
people
to
themselves
and
patty
found
the
three
girls
merry
and
full
of
fun
adelaide
was
about
patty
s
own
age
jeannette
was
younger
and
editha
the
oldest
sister
who
was
eighteen
was
no
longer
a
schoolgirl
but
she
was
not
out
in
society
and
had
teachers
at
home
in
french
and
music
patty
admired
editha
very
much
she
was
so
pretty
and
graceful
and
did
not
put
on
young
ladyfied
airs
adelaide
was
not
pretty
but
she
had
bright
eyes
and
a
humorous
smile
and
patty
soon
discovered
that
to
have
fun
was
the
principal
end
and
aim
of
her
existence
jeannette
seemed
to
be
a
nice
child
and
patty
suddenly
realised
that
it
must
be
a
jolly
sort
of
thing
to
be
one
of
three
sisters
i
quite
envy
you
each
other
she
said
you
must
have
such
good
times
yes
we
do
said
adelaide
haven
t
you
any
brothers
or
sisters
no
said
patty
not
either
and
i
have
no
mother
she
died
when
i
was
a
baby
but
i
shall
have
next
spring
she
added
smiling
for
then
my
father
is
going
to
marry
a
lady
i
m
very
fond
of
she
won
t
be
a
bit
like
a
mother
for
she
s
only
six
years
older
than
i
am
but
she
ll
be
just
like
a
sister
and
i
shall
be
so
glad
to
have
her
with
us
but
i
never
get
lonely
i
have
lots
of
things
to
amuse
myself
and
then
there
s
always
papa
and
how
do
you
like
the
oliphant
school
asked
editha
pretty
well
said
patty
smiling
at
least
i
shall
like
it
when
i
get
a
little
better
acquainted
i
ve
only
been
there
a
week
adelaide
said
nothing
about
lorraine
but
somehow
patty
felt
sure
that
clementine
had
spoken
a
good
word
for
her
and
now
as
she
had
a
chance
to
justify
herself
to
adelaide
she
was
her
own
happy
merry
little
self
and
the
four
girls
got
on
famously
it
was
not
long
before
patty
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
harts
were
a
thoroughly
interesting
family
adelaide
seemed
really
clever
and
patty
was
amazed
to
hear
her
tell
of
a
fountain
which
she
had
herself
constructed
in
the
parlour
of
their
apartment
why
it
was
as
easy
as
anything
she
said
i
just
took
a
big
bronze
flat
one
you
know
that
papa
got
in
rome
or
florence
or
then
i
took
an
antique
bronze
lamp
egyptian
i
think
it
is
and
i
turned
the
lamp
upside
down
on
top
of
the
vase
and
then
i
got
a
piece
of
lead
pipe
and
of
course
we
had
to
have
a
plumber
to
connect
it
with
the
but
the
bathroom
is
just
the
other
side
of
the
partition
and
so
that
was
easy
then
i
put
palms
and
plants
and
things
all
around
it
and
so
it
makes
a
lovely
fountain
would
you
like
to
see
it
can
t
you
come
up
to
our
rooms
now
i
d
like
to
ever
so
much
said
patty
and
after
a
word
to
grandma
the
four
girls
went
off
together
the
harts
apartment
was
very
similar
to
the
fairfields
but
on
the
floor
above
them
it
was
furnished
with
a
queer
jumble
of
tastes
the
main
furniture
of
course
was
that
which
belonged
to
the
hotel
but
the
individual
touches
were
eccentric
and
rather
picturesque
the
fountain
was
really
surprising
and
patty
thought
adelaide
s
description
had
by
no
means
done
it
justice
the
bronzes
were
exceedingly
ornamental
the
palms
were
tall
and
luxurious
and
the
soft
tinkle
of
the
continually
falling
water
made
a
delightful
sound
in
the
lower
basin
were
several
goldfish
and
patty
could
scarcely
believe
that
adelaide
had
planned
and
executed
the
whole
affair
herself
why
it
was
nothing
to
do
said
the
modest
architect
i
love
to
build
things
i
ve
made
boxes
for
all
of
us
i
ll
make
you
one
if
you
want
oh
thank
you
cried
patty
quite
overcome
by
this
delightful
change
in
adelaide
s
attitude
toward
her
i
suppose
you
ll
think
me
very
ignorant
but
really
i
don
t
know
what
a
box
oh
that
s
just
the
name
of
them
explained
editha
you
don
t
have
to
keep
in
them
they
re
just
big
boxes
with
covers
like
a
trunk
and
adelaide
does
make
them
beautifully
she
covers
them
with
a
kind
of
chinese
matting
and
she
even
puts
on
brass
corners
and
hinges
come
into
my
room
with
me
and
i
will
show
you
they
all
followed
editha
to
her
pretty
bedroom
and
patty
saw
and
admired
not
only
the
box
but
many
of
editha
s
other
treasures
among
them
was
a
box
of
chocolates
and
soon
the
girls
were
nibbling
away
at
the
candy
and
as
is
usual
in
such
circumstances
growing
very
friendly
and
well
acquainted
but
though
the
hart
girls
were
so
pleasant
to
patty
they
were
not
so
amiable
with
one
another
editha
patronised
adelaide
and
treated
her
as
if
she
were
very
young
and
ignorant
adelaide
resented
this
but
she
in
turn
domineered
over
jeannette
and
there
were
frequent
sharp
bickerings
back
and
forth
which
made
patty
feel
decidedly
uncomfortable
however
the
harts
had
a
strong
sense
of
humour
and
more
often
than
not
their
squabbles
ended
with
a
joke
and
a
merry
peal
of
laughter
it
was
all
very
novel
and
entertaining
and
when
hart
returned
to
the
apartment
patty
was
surprised
to
learn
that
it
was
after
nine
o
clock
and
that
grandma
had
sent
word
for
her
to
come
home
well
she
said
as
she
sat
down
in
a
little
chair
by
her
father
s
side
i
ve
made
three
friends
anyway
the
hart
girls
are
awfully
nice
they
seem
to
be
rather
snappy
to
each
other
but
they
were
lovely
to
me
and
i
think
i
shall
like
them
they
re
full
of
fun
and
jokes
and
adelaide
is
the
cleverest
thing
you
ever
saw
why
papa
she
has
a
whole
fountain
right
in
their
and
a
terrace
and
a
driveway
no
not
quite
that
but
i
wouldn
t
be
surprised
the
next
time
i
go
to
find
she
has
built
one
she
can
build
well
i
m
glad
you
ve
found
somebody
to
play
with
puss
and
i
hope
they
ll
be
more
satisfactory
than
the
dismal
lorraine
by
the
way
what
became
of
her
did
she
melt
into
thin
air
i
don
t
know
i
m
sure
i
didn
t
see
her
at
all
after
i
suppose
she
abdicated
in
favour
of
adelaide
but
don
t
drop
her
all
at
once
puss
hunt
her
up
and
offer
her
a
chance
to
have
her
share
of
the
fun
whether
she
takes
it
or
chapter
viii
a
on
saturday
when
patty
saw
the
harts
in
the
she
asked
them
to
come
to
see
her
that
afternoon
jeannette
was
going
out
with
her
mother
but
the
other
two
willingly
accepted
the
invitation
i
ll
ask
lorraine
too
said
patty
and
we
ll
make
tea
and
have
a
real
cosey
the
tea
sounds
cheerful
said
adelaide
but
if
you
re
going
to
have
lorraine
i
ll
have
to
ask
you
to
excuse
oh
then
of
course
i
won
t
ask
her
said
patty
quickly
for
she
did
not
think
it
just
to
the
others
to
insist
upon
lorraine
s
presence
i
can
have
her
some
other
time
just
as
well
but
clementine
morse
said
she
would
come
and
see
me
this
that
s
all
right
said
editha
everybody
likes
in
a
gay
mood
patty
prepared
for
her
little
she
easily
persuaded
grandma
to
send
out
for
a
box
of
marshmallows
and
a
big
bag
of
chestnuts
for
she
said
that
lovely
wood
fire
is
just
the
very
place
to
toast
marshmallows
and
roast
chestnuts
i
know
you
ll
like
clementine
morse
grandma
she
s
so
sweet
and
pretty
and
i
know
she
ll
like
the
very
same
patty
paused
in
her
preparations
to
bestow
a
butterfly
kiss
on
grandma
s
forehead
and
then
went
on
arranging
her
dainty
it
ll
be
almost
like
the
tea
club
she
said
as
she
piled
up
the
sugar
lumps
and
cut
thin
slices
of
lemon
i
suppose
they
re
having
a
meeting
this
afternoon
and
marian
is
being
president
do
you
know
grandma
sometimes
i
get
a
little
homesick
for
the
tea
i
should
think
you
would
my
dear
the
vernondale
girls
are
a
nice
set
but
perhaps
you
can
get
up
a
tea
club
i
d
like
that
said
patty
but
the
girls
are
all
so
different
here
they
seem
divided
and
in
vernondale
we
were
all
united
just
like
one
big
the
harts
came
early
editha
brought
a
piece
of
exquisite
she
was
a
dainty
fragile
girl
like
a
piece
of
dresden
china
and
patty
looked
at
her
in
admiration
as
she
deftly
worked
at
the
beautiful
embroidery
what
clever
girls
you
are
said
patty
i
couldn
t
do
anything
like
that
if
i
tried
and
i
couldn
t
make
the
things
adelaide
probably
you
can
do
a
lot
of
things
that
we
can
t
do
said
editha
as
she
threaded
her
needle
i
can
do
lots
of
things
said
patty
laughing
but
i
can
t
do
anything
very
well
i
m
a
the
only
thing
i
really
understand
is
housekeeping
and
here
of
course
i
ve
no
opportunity
for
housekeeping
exclaimed
adelaide
do
you
really
know
how
to
do
that
wherever
did
you
learn
i
used
to
keep
house
in
my
home
in
new
jersey
said
patty
quite
ignoring
the
fact
that
lorraine
had
warned
her
against
mentioning
her
country
home
but
adelaide
apparently
did
not
share
lorraine
s
views
on
this
subject
how
lovely
she
cried
did
you
have
a
whole
house
of
your
own
where
you
could
drive
tacks
in
the
wall
and
do
whatever
you
pleased
yes
said
patty
and
i
had
entire
charge
of
it
i
always
ordered
everything
and
i
can
cook
then
you
re
cleverer
than
we
are
said
editha
with
an
air
of
decision
cooking
is
much
more
difficult
than
embroidering
or
nailing
boards
speak
for
yourself
cried
adelaide
of
course
anybody
can
do
embroidery
but
it
isn
t
so
awful
easy
to
nail
boards
together
properly
why
do
you
do
it
then
retorted
her
sister
i
m
sure
nobody
wants
the
ridiculous
things
you
all
right
then
said
adelaide
give
me
back
that
i
gave
you
yesterday
i
ll
be
glad
to
have
it
for
injun
giver
cried
editha
looking
at
her
sister
angrily
at
first
and
then
breaking
into
a
laugh
take
it
if
you
want
it
i
don
t
care
for
wild
horses
couldn
t
get
that
thing
away
from
her
said
adelaide
to
patty
she
s
just
crazy
over
i
am
not
cried
editha
it
s
nothing
but
useless
all
right
then
i
take
it
and
i
ll
give
it
to
patty
and
just
you
wait
till
i
ever
make
you
anything
again
editha
hart
i
won
t
have
to
wait
long
said
editha
smiling
once
more
and
then
suddenly
adelaide
laughed
too
and
harmony
was
restored
soon
clementine
morse
came
my
brother
brought
me
she
explained
as
she
came
in
and
he
s
coming
for
me
again
at
five
o
patty
introduced
her
new
friend
to
grandma
and
then
clementine
greeted
the
hart
girls
gaily
isn
t
it
lovely
she
exclaimed
for
you
all
to
live
in
this
same
house
together
where
you
can
visit
each
other
whenever
you
like
without
waiting
for
a
brother
to
come
and
bring
you
or
take
you
we
d
wait
a
long
while
for
our
brother
said
adelaide
laughing
and
so
would
patty
you
re
lucky
to
have
a
brother
yes
i
know
it
and
clifford
is
an
awful
nice
boy
but
just
so
sure
as
i
want
him
he
wants
to
be
going
somewhere
else
still
he
s
pretty
good
to
me
oh
what
lovely
marshmallows
are
you
going
to
toast
them
on
good
guesser
cried
patty
that
s
exactly
what
we
re
going
to
do
and
we
re
going
to
do
it
right
now
i
ll
toast
yours
editha
and
pop
them
into
your
mouth
so
you
won
t
get
your
fingers
no
thank
you
said
editha
rolling
up
her
work
half
the
fun
is
in
the
toasting
let
s
all
do
it
we
didn
t
wear
any
hats
said
adelaide
so
we
haven
t
any
with
that
s
one
of
the
disadvantages
of
living
in
the
same
hotel
after
all
said
clementine
of
course
having
no
you
can
t
be
in
the
toasting
party
at
but
grandma
came
to
the
rescue
with
some
and
soon
four
laughing
girls
with
very
red
cheeks
were
sitting
on
the
floor
in
front
of
the
fire
and
the
marshmallows
were
rapidly
disappearing
the
chestnuts
were
voted
to
be
nearly
as
much
fun
as
the
confections
and
the
feast
was
at
its
height
when
the
doorbell
rang
and
kenneth
harper
was
announced
oh
ken
cried
patty
scrambling
to
her
feet
i
m
so
glad
to
see
you
we
re
having
a
roasting
and
toasting
party
and
it
s
lucky
you
came
before
it
s
all
eaten
kenneth
shook
hands
with
patty
and
then
politely
greeted
grandma
elliott
who
was
always
glad
to
welcome
the
boy
then
he
was
presented
to
the
girls
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
young
people
were
chattering
like
friendly
and
magpies
patty
quite
in
her
element
hovered
round
the
and
made
tea
in
her
usual
successful
fashion
grandma
produced
a
surprise
in
the
shape
of
dear
little
frosted
cakes
and
the
healthy
young
appetites
did
full
justice
to
all
these
things
how
is
the
farm
growing
patty
inquired
kenneth
i
thought
i
d
come
down
and
mow
the
grass
for
i
wish
you
would
said
patty
it
s
growing
all
over
the
place
and
threatens
to
choke
the
tulip
bulbs
before
they
sprout
but
oh
ken
you
ought
to
see
adelaide
s
palmery
or
palmistry
or
whatever
it
is
she
has
an
old
venetian
fountain
that
plays
all
the
time
and
goldfish
swim
in
it
and
the
palms
grow
on
its
banks
and
it
s
perfectly
lovely
and
she
made
it
all
i
always
told
you
that
the
city
girls
were
clever
said
kenneth
smiling
at
patty
still
a
fountain
is
really
outside
of
my
it
wasn
t
difficult
said
adelaide
i
have
a
mechanical
turn
of
mind
and
the
fountain
was
an
easy
matter
but
what
i
m
puzzling
over
now
is
how
to
build
a
suspension
bridge
across
the
library
table
our
library
is
so
small
and
the
table
is
so
big
and
there
are
so
many
of
us
to
sit
around
it
that
you
can
t
cross
the
room
at
all
and
so
i
thought
a
suspension
bridge
would
be
both
useful
and
i
m
sure
it
would
said
kenneth
and
as
i
expect
to
be
a
some
day
i
might
help
you
draw
your
plans
now
it
will
be
good
i
wish
you
d
hurry
up
and
get
it
built
said
editha
it
will
be
useful
for
a
great
many
purposes
i
would
stand
on
it
sometimes
and
recite
i
stood
on
the
bridge
at
midnight
it
would
be
so
very
i
hope
you
ll
do
it
at
midnight
and
then
the
rest
of
us
needn
t
hear
your
recitation
put
in
adelaide
patty
feared
one
of
the
sisterly
squabbles
and
hastened
to
interrupt
it
i
would
come
over
and
stand
on
your
bridge
and
recite
how
horatius
kept
the
and
i
will
stand
at
thy
right
hand
and
keep
the
bridge
with
thee
said
kenneth
in
exaggerated
dramatic
tones
well
a
bridge
seems
to
be
a
household
necessity
said
clementine
i
don
t
see
how
we
ve
worried
along
without
one
as
long
as
we
in
merry
nonsense
and
chaff
the
time
slipped
away
and
everyone
was
surprised
when
clifford
morse
came
for
his
sister
and
said
it
was
after
five
o
clock
the
boy
was
invited
in
and
patty
begged
of
him
that
clementine
might
stay
a
few
moments
longer
although
clifford
morse
was
only
eighteen
he
was
a
young
giant
more
than
six
feet
tall
he
was
and
his
boyish
face
was
framed
in
a
thick
crop
of
brown
hair
and
his
athletic
carriage
and
bearing
was
marked
by
the
usual
athlete
s
grace
the
courteous
respect
he
showed
to
grandma
elliott
and
his
frank
pleasant
manner
toward
the
girls
proved
him
a
and
young
american
citizen
and
though
meeting
for
the
first
time
he
and
kenneth
harper
instinctively
felt
a
mutual
friendliness
this
is
right
down
jolly
he
exclaimed
as
he
took
the
cup
of
tea
patty
offered
him
i
have
attended
affairs
that
were
called
afternoon
teas
but
there
must
have
been
a
mistake
somewhere
they
were
oppressive
and
functions
but
this
is
the
real
thing
is
it
of
frequent
occurrence
miss
fairfield
or
must
i
wait
a
long
and
weary
while
before
i
may
come
take
my
sister
home
you
must
ask
grandma
said
patty
laughing
she
is
the
captain
and
the
cook
and
the
crew
of
this
i
am
only
the
young
morse
turned
to
grandma
elliott
with
his
merry
smile
may
i
hope
to
come
again
he
said
if
i
promise
to
be
very
good
and
not
drink
up
all
the
tea
you
may
come
any
saturday
afternoon
when
we
are
at
home
said
grandma
smiling
but
it
s
only
fair
to
warn
you
that
we
re
very
rarely
home
on
i
shall
come
said
clifford
and
i
ll
come
early
and
i
ll
make
myself
so
charming
that
you
ll
quite
forget
all
other
you
may
try
it
said
grandma
looking
kindly
at
the
merry
boy
the
click
of
the
key
was
heard
in
the
front
door
and
in
a
few
moments
fairfield
joined
the
party
then
there
were
more
introductions
and
more
jokes
and
much
laughter
for
fairfield
was
a
universal
favourite
with
children
and
young
people
and
had
a
talent
for
always
saying
and
doing
exactly
the
right
thing
he
was
as
courteous
to
the
girls
including
patty
as
though
they
had
been
ladies
and
he
greeted
the
boys
with
a
frank
cordiality
as
of
man
to
man
which
delighted
their
young
souls
then
clementine
declared
she
must
go
home
and
accompanied
by
kenneth
she
and
her
brother
took
their
departure
then
editha
and
adelaide
went
away
and
patty
sat
down
by
her
father
s
side
to
talk
it
all
over
we
had
a
beautiful
time
papa
she
said
and
they
re
a
nice
crowd
but
what
do
you
think
the
hart
girls
said
they
wouldn
t
come
if
i
asked
lorraine
so
i
didn
t
ask
her
and
i
m
glad
of
it
for
she
would
have
spoiled
the
whole
party
but
it
does
seem
too
bad
doesn
t
it
yes
it
does
puss
but
you
mustn
t
take
it
too
much
to
heart
you
re
not
responsible
for
lorraine
s
unpopularity
and
you
mustn
t
allow
it
to
spoil
your
good
times
whenever
you
can
help
her
or
give
her
pleasure
in
any
way
that
she
will
accept
graciously
i
know
you
ll
do
indeed
i
will
for
i
m
really
going
to
try
to
make
that
girl
happier
but
of
course
i
can
t
force
the
other
girls
to
help
me
though
after
i
know
them
better
i
may
be
able
to
coax
them
you
re
a
good
little
girl
patty
and
you
re
showing
a
kind
and
generous
spirit
let
the
good
work
go
on
and
some
day
when
you
least
expect
it
i
ll
help
you
out
with
chapter
ix
hilda
on
monday
morning
patty
started
for
her
second
week
at
the
oliphant
school
without
any
misgivings
as
to
her
reception
by
the
girls
although
little
had
been
said
regarding
lorraine
and
though
patty
had
loyally
refrained
from
disclaiming
her
as
an
intimate
friend
yet
clementine
and
adelaide
both
understood
matters
better
now
and
were
quite
ready
to
accept
patty
on
her
own
merits
so
it
came
about
that
she
walked
to
school
between
adelaide
and
lorraine
and
though
her
two
companions
had
little
to
say
to
each
other
patty
skilfully
managed
to
be
pleasant
and
sociable
with
both
of
course
the
morning
was
entirely
occupied
with
lessons
but
at
the
noon
hour
adelaide
appropriated
patty
and
carried
her
off
to
join
a
group
off
girls
who
were
merrily
chatting
together
clementine
was
one
of
them
and
in
a
few
moments
patty
discovered
that
they
were
all
gigs
and
seemed
proud
of
the
appellation
it
will
be
the
most
fun
flossy
fisher
was
saying
i
ll
manage
the
can
always
wind
her
around
my
she
won
t
know
what
it
s
all
about
until
she
finds
herself
down
cellar
in
front
of
the
mirror
you
ll
come
to
it
won
t
you
patty
what
is
it
and
where
and
when
and
how
and
why
asked
patty
laughing
you
see
i
m
a
new
girl
and
a
green
one
but
i
suppose
from
your
mention
of
the
elephant
you
re
talking
about
a
it
will
be
a
circus
said
clementine
but
a
little
private
one
of
our
own
the
elephant
is
our
pet
name
for
miss
oliphant
and
we
gigs
are
always
playing
tricks
on
her
she
pretends
she
doesn
t
like
it
but
i
think
she
does
for
often
behind
her
frowning
spectacles
she
hides
a
smiling
isn
t
clementine
the
cleverest
thing
exclaimed
adelaide
she
can
misquote
from
all
the
standard
british
and
american
authors
it
s
a
great
thing
to
be
the
bright
and
shining
light
of
the
literature
but
tell
me
more
about
this
elephant
performance
said
patty
why
are
you
going
to
put
miss
oliphant
down
cellar
sh
breathe
it
not
aloud
warned
clementine
the
wild
west
must
not
hear
it
it
isn
t
until
hallowe
en
you
know
and
the
announcement
of
luncheon
interrupted
this
conversation
and
the
girls
started
for
the
adelaide
insisted
that
patty
should
sit
at
their
table
but
for
two
reasons
patty
hesitated
about
this
in
the
first
place
she
did
not
quite
want
to
desert
lorraine
so
completely
and
second
she
was
not
yet
sure
that
she
wanted
to
proclaim
herself
one
of
the
gigs
still
less
did
she
want
to
be
a
prig
and
she
well
knew
she
could
never
by
the
widest
stretch
of
imagination
be
called
a
dig
so
she
concluded
not
to
ally
herself
definitely
with
either
of
these
mystic
orders
until
she
had
opportunity
for
further
consideration
so
she
firmly
but
declined
to
change
her
table
for
the
present
and
took
her
usual
place
by
the
side
of
lorraine
well
said
lorraine
pettishly
you
seem
to
have
made
a
great
many
new
yes
said
patty
determined
to
be
pleasant
i
have
i
m
getting
better
acquainted
with
the
girls
and
i
think
they
re
a
very
nice
lot
you
can
t
judge
much
the
first
few
days
you
know
clementine
is
a
dear
isn
t
she
i
don
t
see
anything
dear
about
her
i
think
she
s
silly
and
why
lorraine
how
absurd
clementine
isn
t
at
well
i
think
she
is
and
anyway
i
don
t
like
after
which
gracious
speech
lorraine
devoted
herself
to
eating
her
luncheon
and
was
so
unresponsive
to
further
attempts
at
conversation
that
patty
gave
it
up
and
turned
to
talk
to
the
girl
on
the
other
side
of
her
this
was
hilda
henderson
an
english
girl
who
had
lived
in
america
only
about
two
years
she
was
slender
yet
with
a
suggestion
of
hardy
strength
in
her
small
bones
and
active
muscles
she
had
a
quick
nervous
manner
and
her
head
which
was
daintily
set
on
her
shoulders
moved
with
the
alert
motions
of
a
bird
not
exactly
pretty
but
with
dark
straight
hair
and
dark
eyes
she
looked
like
a
girl
of
fine
traits
and
strong
character
patty
had
liked
the
appearance
of
this
girl
from
the
first
but
had
not
seemed
to
be
able
to
make
friends
with
her
but
fortified
by
the
new
conditions
which
were
developing
she
made
overtures
with
a
little
more
confidence
you
are
a
boarding
pupil
here
aren
t
you
said
patty
do
you
know
anything
about
the
plans
for
a
hallowe
en
party
no
said
hilda
except
that
there
s
going
to
be
one
i
fancy
it
will
be
just
like
last
year
s
are
they
nice
what
do
you
do
at
them
yes
they
re
rather
good
fun
we
bob
for
apples
and
go
downstairs
backward
and
sail
boats
and
all
those
patty
said
nothing
further
about
miss
oliphant
s
part
in
it
as
she
thought
perhaps
it
was
a
secret
you
must
have
real
good
times
living
here
she
went
on
so
many
of
you
girls
all
yes
it
s
not
so
very
horrid
though
it
s
very
unlike
an
english
boarding
school
american
girls
are
so
yes
we
are
but
i
like
that
don
t
you
oh
if
one
has
anything
to
be
excited
over
it
s
all
very
well
but
you
waste
such
a
lot
of
enthusiasm
that
when
anything
comes
along
really
worth
while
you
have
no
words
left
to
show
your
appreciation
of
oh
i
have
said
patty
laughing
or
if
i
haven
t
i
use
the
same
words
over
again
they
don
t
wear
out
you
yes
they
do
said
hilda
earnestly
you
say
everything
is
perfectly
grand
or
gorgeous
when
it
s
most
commonplace
and
then
when
you
come
across
something
really
grand
or
gorgeous
what
can
you
say
of
course
that
s
all
true
but
that
s
just
a
way
we
have
you
like
america
don
t
you
yes
rather
well
but
i
never
shall
learn
to
rave
over
nothing
the
way
you
all
how
do
you
know
i
do
you
scarcely
know
me
at
all
you
re
not
as
much
so
as
the
rest
and
i
think
i
shall
like
you
but
i
don
t
make
friends
easily
and
often
i
don
t
get
on
with
the
very
ones
i
most
want
oh
you
ll
get
on
with
me
all
right
if
you
have
the
least
mite
of
a
wish
to
i
make
friends
awfully
easily
that
is
i
generally
have
supplemented
patty
suddenly
remembering
her
experiences
of
the
past
week
i
think
i
d
like
to
be
friends
with
you
said
hilda
with
an
air
of
thoughtful
caution
but
of
course
i
can
t
say
of
course
not
said
patty
unable
to
resist
poking
a
little
fun
at
this
very
practical
girl
i
think
you
ought
to
know
anybody
four
weeks
before
you
decide
and
then
take
them
on
i
think
so
too
said
hilda
heartily
taking
patty
quite
seriously
though
the
speech
had
been
meant
entirely
in
jest
you
re
awfully
sensible
for
an
yes
i
think
i
am
said
patty
demurely
after
luncheon
another
triumph
awaited
patty
gertrude
lyons
and
maude
carleton
came
up
to
her
and
each
taking
her
by
one
arm
walked
her
over
to
the
where
they
might
talk
uninterruptedly
we
want
you
to
be
in
our
set
said
gertrude
we
have
the
nicest
girls
in
school
in
our
set
and
i
know
you
ll
like
it
best
of
and
we
have
the
best
times
put
in
maude
none
of
the
sets
can
do
the
things
we
patty
did
not
altogether
like
this
sudden
change
of
attitude
on
the
part
of
these
girls
and
too
they
seemed
to
her
a
little
condescending
in
their
manner
she
liked
better
hilda
henderson
s
proposition
which
though
less
flattering
seemed
to
promise
better
results
and
she
had
not
forgotten
gertrude
s
real
rudeness
the
week
before
thank
you
ever
so
much
she
said
but
i
m
not
sure
that
i
want
to
join
your
set
last
week
you
didn
t
want
me
and
turn
about
is
fair
patty
s
pleasant
smile
as
she
said
this
robbed
the
words
of
all
harshness
and
made
it
impossible
for
the
girls
to
feel
offended
i
suppose
i
hateful
said
gertrude
and
i
take
it
all
back
but
you
see
everybody
said
you
were
lorraine
hamilton
s
chum
and
that
you
were
just
like
her
now
you
re
not
a
bit
like
her
and
i
don
t
believe
you
re
such
a
great
chum
of
hers
are
you
i
don
t
know
how
to
answer
that
said
patty
smiling
i
m
a
friend
of
lorraine
s
and
always
shall
be
i
hope
but
i
m
not
such
a
chum
of
hers
that
i
can
t
be
friends
with
anybody
that
s
what
i
said
put
in
maude
and
so
there
s
no
reason
why
you
can
t
belong
to
our
set
even
if
lorraine
doesn
why
do
they
call
you
the
prigs
asked
patty
gertrude
laughed
they
think
the
name
teases
us
she
said
but
it
doesn
t
a
bit
they
call
us
prigs
because
they
think
we
re
and
so
we
are
we
re
the
richest
girls
in
the
school
and
we
belong
to
the
best
families
but
that
isn
t
all
we
have
the
best
manners
and
we
re
never
rude
or
awkward
and
we
re
always
perfect
in
deportment
so
we
re
almost
always
on
the
privileged
what
s
the
privileged
roll
asked
patty
why
it
s
a
special
roll
of
honour
and
if
your
name
s
on
it
you
have
a
lot
of
little
extra
favours
and
privileges
that
the
others
don
t
have
the
gigs
now
they
never
get
on
the
privileged
roll
they
have
a
lot
of
fun
but
i
think
it
s
silly
and
and
the
digs
asked
patty
are
they
on
the
privileged
roll
not
often
said
gertrude
they
get
perfect
in
their
lessons
of
course
but
they
re
so
busy
studying
they
are
apt
to
forget
their
manners
hilda
henderson
is
a
dig
but
she
has
good
manners
because
she
s
english
english
girls
always
do
they
can
t
seem
to
help
i
like
hilda
henderson
said
patty
she
seems
to
me
an
awfully
nice
yes
she
s
nice
enough
said
maude
carelessly
but
she
s
rather
heavy
and
not
up
to
our
ideas
of
the
rang
just
then
and
with
a
promise
to
think
about
joining
gertrude
s
set
patty
left
them
after
school
she
walked
home
with
lorraine
adelaide
had
been
detained
and
the
two
girls
went
home
alone
i
suppose
you
ll
be
dreadfully
thick
with
the
prigs
now
that
they
ve
taken
you
up
said
lorraine
they
haven
t
taken
me
up
yet
replied
patty
a
little
shortly
well
they
re
beginning
to
hang
around
you
so
i
suppose
they
will
take
you
up
they
ve
already
asked
me
to
join
their
set
if
that
s
what
you
mean
by
taking
well
then
of
course
you
ll
join
it
and
i
suppose
you
ll
have
no
use
for
me
after
now
look
here
lorraine
we
might
as
well
have
this
out
now
once
for
all
i
d
like
to
be
a
friend
of
yours
but
there
are
lots
of
times
when
you
make
me
feel
as
if
you
didn
t
want
me
to
be
and
besides
i
expect
to
be
friends
with
everybody
that
s
the
way
i
always
have
been
it
s
my
nature
and
if
being
friends
with
you
is
going
to
prevent
my
having
anything
to
do
with
anybody
else
in
the
whole
school
why
then
i
m
not
going
to
do
it
that
s
i
told
you
so
said
lorraine
staring
moodily
before
her
i
knew
when
those
prigs
took
you
up
you
d
drop
but
i
won
t
drop
you
lorraine
said
patty
exasperated
by
such
injustice
and
if
you
drop
me
it
s
your
own
fault
what
is
the
matter
with
you
anyway
why
don
t
you
like
anybody
because
nobody
likes
me
i
suppose
and
lorraine
s
face
wore
such
a
helpless
hopeless
expression
that
patty
s
indignation
calmed
down
a
little
i
feel
like
shaking
you
she
said
half
angry
half
laughing
now
see
here
why
don
t
you
try
a
different
tack
just
make
up
your
mind
that
you
like
everybody
and
act
so
and
first
thing
you
know
they
ll
all
like
patty
expected
an
irritable
retort
of
some
kind
and
was
surprised
when
lorraine
said
wistfully
do
you
really
think
so
patty
of
course
i
do
cried
patty
delighted
to
find
lorraine
so
responsive
just
you
try
it
girlie
and
see
if
i
m
not
a
true
i
ll
try
said
lorraine
who
seemed
to
be
in
a
particularly
gentle
mood
at
least
for
the
moment
but
i
haven
t
much
hope
of
myself
or
anybody
else
i
m
cross
and
ugly
by
nature
and
i
don
t
suppose
i
ll
ever
be
any
oh
pshaw
cried
patty
yes
you
will
never
mind
what
you
are
by
nature
try
art
make
believe
you
re
happy
and
jolly
like
other
people
and
suddenly
you
ll
discover
that
you
chapter
x
grigs
the
more
patty
saw
of
hilda
henderson
the
better
she
liked
her
hilda
was
not
quite
so
as
clementine
yet
she
was
far
more
merry
and
companionable
than
lorraine
so
it
came
about
that
hilda
and
patty
were
much
together
they
often
walked
together
when
the
school
went
for
a
promenade
in
the
park
and
patty
was
surprised
to
find
that
there
was
a
lot
of
fun
in
the
english
girl
after
all
then
too
they
were
congenial
in
their
tastes
they
liked
the
same
things
they
read
the
same
books
and
they
almost
always
agreed
in
their
opinions
one
day
the
girls
were
gathered
in
the
gymnasium
it
was
recreation
hour
and
the
various
groups
of
young
people
were
chatting
and
laughing
patty
sat
in
a
looking
out
at
the
steadily
falling
rain
it
s
a
funny
thing
she
said
but
although
a
rainy
day
is
supposed
to
be
depressing
it
doesn
t
affect
me
that
way
at
all
i
feel
positively
hilarious
and
i
don
t
care
who
knows
so
do
i
said
hilda
i
m
as
merry
as
a
i
know
most
of
your
english
allusions
said
patty
but
grig
is
too
many
for
me
what
is
a
grig
and
why
is
it
merry
a
grig
said
hilda
why
it
s
a
kind
of
cricket
or
grasshopper
i
think
i
don
t
know
natural
history
very
well
but
the
habits
of
grigs
must
be
merry
because
as
merry
as
a
grig
is
the
only
thing
anybody
ever
heard
about
of
course
grasshoppers
are
merry
said
clementine
you
can
tell
that
by
the
way
they
jump
but
grig
is
a
much
nicer
name
than
grasshopper
it
sounds
more
girls
said
patty
with
an
air
of
sudden
importance
i
have
a
most
brilliant
idea
your
first
inquired
adelaide
interestedly
no
indeed
said
patty
i
often
have
them
when
i
m
in
your
vicinity
but
this
is
really
great
you
know
that
foolishness
about
prigs
and
digs
and
gigs
yes
said
the
girls
in
chorus
well
there
s
no
sense
to
it
it
doesn
t
mean
anything
do
you
happen
to
know
miss
fairfield
that
you
re
attacking
old
and
institutions
of
the
oliphant
school
asked
clementine
in
mock
indignation
so
much
the
worse
for
the
honourable
time
rejoined
patty
now
listen
i
think
we
can
have
a
society
a
real
true
society
i
mean
that
will
be
a
lot
more
fun
than
any
of
those
ancient
and
honourable
grigs
cried
hilda
with
a
sudden
flash
of
understanding
yes
said
patty
grigs
you
see
i
never
could
make
up
my
mind
which
of
those
other
three
sets
i
d
belong
to
because
none
of
them
seemed
to
fit
me
now
if
we
start
a
society
of
grigs
a
regular
club
you
know
we
can
invite
anybody
we
want
in
the
school
to
join
what
kind
of
a
society
will
it
be
demanded
adelaide
what
is
the
chief
characteristic
of
a
grig
demanded
patty
in
return
well
i
never
met
one
said
adelaide
but
hilda
says
they
have
nothing
but
merriment
to
distinguish
them
from
other
that
s
enough
said
patty
all
that
the
members
of
our
society
need
do
is
to
be
merry
honest
girls
don
t
you
think
it
will
be
fun
i
do
said
hilda
catching
the
spirit
of
the
thing
at
once
and
we
ll
have
officers
and
dues
and
regular
meetings
just
just
like
parliament
put
in
clementine
and
then
my
british
subject
you
ll
feel
quite
at
i
used
to
belong
to
a
club
in
vernondale
said
patty
and
we
didn
t
do
anything
but
just
drink
tea
and
have
fun
at
our
meetings
we
were
merry
as
grigs
though
we
didn
t
call
ourselves
by
that
name
but
i
think
that
s
a
jolly
name
for
a
a
society
that
has
to
be
made
up
of
prigs
and
gigs
and
so
do
i
said
hilda
let
s
organise
right
oh
we
can
t
said
patty
we
haven
t
decided
what
girls
to
ask
or
let
s
organise
first
said
adelaide
just
we
four
you
know
and
then
decide
on
the
other
members
all
right
said
patty
but
the
bell
will
ring
in
a
minute
and
we
won
t
have
time
now
besides
we
can
t
do
it
in
such
a
hurry
now
i
ll
tell
you
what
you
girls
come
down
to
my
house
saturday
morning
and
then
we
ll
do
it
all
up
that
s
a
jolly
lark
said
hilda
i
ll
be
and
the
others
agreed
to
come
too
so
on
saturday
morning
the
fairfields
library
was
the
scene
of
a
most
animated
club
organisation
we
ought
to
have
some
definite
aim
said
hilda
as
they
talked
over
ways
and
means
we
have
said
patty
decidedly
i
ve
been
thinking
this
thing
over
and
i
really
think
that
to
be
merry
and
to
scatter
merriment
around
the
world
is
a
worthy
enough
aim
for
how
do
you
mean
to
scatter
it
asked
adelaide
with
a
look
of
utter
bewilderment
at
the
idea
i
don
t
know
yet
exactly
said
patty
that
s
for
the
club
to
decide
but
i
m
sure
there
are
lots
of
ways
you
know
the
charitable
societies
scatter
food
and
clothing
and
there
s
a
sunshine
society
that
scatters
help
or
aid
or
something
and
i
do
believe
that
there
are
plenty
of
ways
to
scatter
do
you
mean
to
poor
people
asked
clementine
not
only
to
poor
people
said
patty
it
doesn
t
make
any
difference
whether
they
re
poor
or
not
everybody
likes
to
have
some
fun
or
if
they
don
t
they
ought
it
s
a
great
scheme
exclaimed
hilda
her
eyes
shining
as
she
thought
of
various
possibilities
for
one
thing
we
could
collect
comic
papers
and
take
them
to
the
yes
that
will
be
fine
said
clementine
for
when
most
people
send
reading
matter
to
the
hospitals
they
send
dry
old
books
and
poky
old
magazines
that
nobody
can
read
i
know
because
i
have
been
to
the
hospital
sometimes
to
read
to
the
children
and
i
ve
seen
the
literature
that
was
sent
in
and
of
all
forlorn
stuff
yes
that
s
the
kind
of
thing
i
mean
said
patty
and
we
can
go
to
the
hospitals
ourselves
sometimes
and
chirk
up
the
patients
and
make
them
laugh
clementine
could
sing
some
of
her
funny
songs
but
that
s
only
a
part
of
it
we
ll
have
meetings
too
where
we
ll
just
be
merry
as
grigs
ourselves
and
make
fun
for
each
well
i
think
the
whole
thing
is
lovely
said
adelaide
let
s
organise
right
straight
off
patty
of
course
you
ll
be
of
course
i
won
t
said
patty
quickly
hilda
must
be
president
because
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
her
we
would
never
have
known
what
grigs
were
and
so
we
couldn
t
be
hilda
demurred
at
accepting
the
honourable
position
and
adelaide
frankly
said
she
thought
patty
better
adapted
for
it
but
patty
was
firm
and
insisted
that
the
office
should
be
hilda
s
i
ll
be
secretary
if
you
like
she
said
or
anything
else
but
i
won
t
be
so
hilda
was
made
president
and
patty
secretary
of
the
noble
society
of
grigs
clementine
was
appointed
and
adelaide
treasurer
the
four
officers
wanted
to
enter
upon
their
duties
at
once
and
adelaide
begged
that
they
would
decide
upon
what
the
dues
should
be
so
that
she
might
collect
them
clementine
asked
hilda
to
go
home
in
order
that
she
might
be
president
during
her
absence
and
patty
declared
that
there
was
no
use
trying
to
keep
the
minutes
of
a
society
of
grigs
for
it
would
read
like
a
but
hilda
who
had
some
notions
of
taking
charge
of
a
meeting
called
the
members
to
order
and
expressed
her
views
we
don
t
want
to
be
bothered
with
much
in
the
way
of
rules
and
regulations
she
said
but
we
must
have
some
few
laws
if
we
re
going
to
be
a
society
at
all
now
first
how
many
members
shall
we
have
first
said
patty
where
are
you
going
to
meet
do
you
think
it
will
be
more
fun
just
to
have
a
school
society
and
have
our
meetings
there
say
in
the
gymnasium
or
do
you
think
it
will
be
nicer
to
meet
around
at
each
other
s
houses
oh
around
at
the
houses
said
clementine
let
s
meet
saturday
mornings
just
like
this
if
we
have
it
at
school
we
ll
have
to
ask
a
lot
of
girls
we
don
t
want
or
else
they
ll
get
this
argument
was
considered
good
and
meetings
at
the
homes
of
the
members
seemed
to
be
the
best
plan
but
not
every
week
said
adelaide
i
couldn
t
come
so
often
i
have
a
singing
lesson
every
other
saturday
so
it
was
agreed
that
the
grigs
should
meet
once
a
fortnight
during
the
school
term
and
it
was
furthermore
settled
that
eight
members
would
be
enough
for
the
present
for
our
rooms
are
awfully
small
said
hilda
and
it
will
be
all
i
can
do
to
get
eight
our
house
is
big
enough
said
clementine
but
i
think
eight
is
enough
to
start
with
until
we
see
how
the
club
goes
now
who
shall
the
other
four
be
how
would
it
do
said
hilda
for
us
each
to
select
one
do
they
have
to
be
girls
in
the
school
asked
adelaide
because
if
not
i
ll
ask
editha
she
s
merry
enough
for
anybody
and
she
loves
to
do
things
for
hospital
why
of
course
they
don
t
have
to
be
schoolgirls
said
hilda
perhaps
it
s
better
to
have
some
who
aren
t
and
then
those
who
are
and
whom
we
don
t
ask
won
t
have
so
much
reason
to
get
mad
about
although
somewhat
ambiguous
this
speech
was
understood
by
the
other
grigs
and
they
all
heartily
agreed
to
it
then
clementine
said
she
would
ask
flossy
fisher
as
flossy
was
the
embodiment
of
merriment
they
all
thought
her
a
most
acceptable
member
i
shall
ask
mary
sargent
said
hilda
you
girls
don
t
know
her
very
well
and
she
seems
quiet
but
really
there
s
a
lot
of
fun
in
her
and
you
ll
find
it
oh
i
think
she
s
jolly
said
clementine
anybody
must
be
to
draw
such
funny
pictures
as
she
does
she
got
me
giggling
in
class
the
other
day
and
i
came
near
being
marked
in
deportment
it
was
an
awful
narrow
escape
who
are
you
going
to
ask
patty
patty
looked
at
her
three
i
ve
made
up
my
mind
she
said
and
her
eyes
twinkled
i
shall
ask
lorraine
a
chorus
of
groans
greeted
this
announcement
and
then
clementine
said
that
s
a
good
joke
patty
and
an
awfully
funny
one
but
honest
who
do
you
mean
to
ask
it
isn
t
a
joke
said
patty
you
girls
each
made
your
selection
and
nobody
found
any
fault
now
i
think
i
ought
to
have
the
same
but
we
chose
merry
girls
said
adelaide
nobody
could
call
lorraine
as
merry
as
a
grig
oh
patty
she
ll
spoil
the
whole
but
listen
girls
the
club
is
to
make
other
people
merry
as
well
as
to
be
merry
ourselves
and
don
t
you
think
it
would
be
a
good
thing
if
we
could
make
lorraine
merry
yes
said
hilda
but
the
people
we
re
going
to
cheer
up
are
not
members
of
the
club
i
think
the
members
ought
to
be
really
grigs
and
not
croaking
ravens
like
if
she
s
a
member
i
won
t
be
said
adelaide
and
editha
won
t
then
that
settles
it
said
patty
cheerfully
of
course
adelaide
i
wouldn
t
do
anything
that
would
keep
you
out
of
the
club
but
look
here
girls
if
lorraine
gets
more
pleasant
and
sunshiny
after
a
while
will
you
let
her
come
in
then
if
she
gets
to
be
as
merry
as
a
grig
of
course
she
can
come
in
said
adelaide
lorraine
is
a
nice
enough
girl
except
that
she
s
so
disagreeable
and
always
throws
a
wet
blanket
on
everything
why
we
couldn
t
have
any
fun
at
all
at
the
meetings
if
she
sat
up
there
looking
as
cross
as
two
that
s
so
said
patty
with
a
sigh
but
never
you
mind
she
s
going
to
improve
she
said
she
d
try
to
and
somehow
the
grigs
must
help
and
in
the
meantime
you
must
choose
somebody
else
no
i
don
t
want
to
let
s
just
leave
her
place
vacant
for
the
present
and
if
we
want
anyone
else
in
we
can
decide
about
it
all
right
said
hilda
and
really
i
wouldn
t
be
surprised
if
lorraine
should
improve
why
one
day
this
week
i
saw
her
i
saw
it
too
exclaimed
clementine
it
was
tuesday
at
noon
hour
the
rest
of
the
girls
were
almost
in
hysterics
over
something
or
other
and
i
saw
lorraine
break
into
a
small
timid
little
smile
oh
she
ll
be
merry
as
a
grig
yet
chapter
xi
experiences
as
a
society
the
grigs
prospered
the
next
meeting
was
at
clementine
s
and
was
a
very
busy
and
merry
one
patty
had
never
been
to
clementine
s
home
before
and
she
was
delighted
with
the
large
beautiful
house
and
also
with
clementine
s
mother
who
was
a
lady
and
who
reminded
her
a
little
bit
of
aunt
alice
after
the
members
had
all
arrived
clementine
took
them
to
a
room
on
the
third
floor
which
was
her
own
especial
domain
we
always
call
it
the
she
said
because
it
was
my
when
i
was
a
little
child
lately
i
ve
tried
to
have
them
call
it
studio
or
library
or
even
den
but
somehow
the
old
name
sticks
and
we
always
the
room
itself
was
most
attractive
with
books
and
games
and
toys
in
abundance
in
the
middle
of
the
room
was
a
long
low
table
and
the
girls
gathered
about
this
eager
to
begin
the
work
they
had
planned
to
do
for
though
only
their
second
meeting
the
grigs
had
arranged
during
the
week
many
plans
for
the
furtherance
of
the
ends
and
aims
of
their
club
so
clementine
had
provided
scissors
and
paste
pencils
and
sewing
materials
and
soon
the
work
was
in
progress
some
made
with
muslin
leaves
while
others
cut
out
pictures
to
paste
in
these
books
these
were
intended
for
the
children
in
a
certain
nearby
hospital
of
course
said
editha
hart
these
are
no
novelty
every
girl
i
ve
ever
known
has
made
muslin
for
hospitals
at
some
time
in
her
life
but
these
are
different
because
they
re
filled
with
really
funny
yes
said
mary
sargent
i
ve
seen
the
some
girls
make
the
pictures
are
usually
advertising
cards
or
else
stupid
old
things
that
couldn
t
amuse
anybody
these
coloured
supplement
pictures
are
certainly
funny
if
they
aren
t
the
very
best
type
of
high
if
they
make
the
children
laugh
our
work
is
accomplished
said
patty
what
we
want
to
do
said
clementine
is
to
make
two
smiles
grow
where
one
grew
clementine
is
a
walking
literature
class
isn
t
she
said
flossy
fisher
admiringly
we
had
something
like
that
in
the
lesson
yesterday
but
where
are
the
peanuts
did
anyone
bring
any
yes
here
s
a
bagful
said
adelaide
hurry
up
and
get
them
together
while
i
make
the
flossy
s
task
was
the
making
of
funny
little
chinese
dolls
by
stringing
peanuts
together
while
adelaide
braided
coarse
black
thread
into
little
queues
for
them
and
hilda
made
fantastic
costumes
out
of
japanese
paper
napkins
editha
was
engaged
in
producing
wonderful
effects
with
nothing
but
sheets
of
and
a
box
of
paints
she
deftly
rolled
tied
and
draped
the
material
into
a
comical
doll
and
then
cleverly
painted
features
hair
hands
and
dress
trimmings
until
the
whole
was
a
work
of
art
now
you
know
said
hilda
after
all
the
girls
had
settled
down
to
work
we
re
to
tell
our
experiences
during
the
week
in
the
way
of
helping
along
the
gaiety
of
the
nation
patty
fairfield
what
have
you
done
to
make
somebody
else
as
merry
as
a
grig
well
said
patty
apologetically
i
really
haven
t
had
many
opportunities
though
i
tried
hard
to
make
some
the
trouble
is
my
family
and
most
of
my
friends
are
merry
anyhow
and
they
don
t
need
any
chirking
up
and
of
course
i
couldn
t
go
out
into
the
highways
and
hedges
but
i
had
one
experience
which
i
think
will
count
and
i
ll
tell
you
about
it
i
was
going
up
in
the
elevator
yesterday
and
i
stood
next
to
a
lady
whom
i
know
slightly
her
name
is
miss
dennison
and
she
lives
in
the
wilberforce
she
is
a
writer
or
she
makes
speeches
at
women
s
conventions
or
club
meetings
well
she
never
is
very
but
yesterday
she
looked
cross
enough
to
bite
a
nail
into
ten
pennies
i
was
almost
afraid
to
get
into
the
elevator
for
fear
she
d
snap
my
head
off
and
the
elevator
boy
was
positively
quaking
in
his
i
know
that
miss
dennison
said
adelaide
she
s
most
i
think
she
s
a
woman
s
rights
suffragist
or
whatever
you
call
yes
that
s
the
one
said
patty
and
yesterday
although
she
didn
t
say
anything
i
could
see
at
a
glance
that
she
was
in
a
terrible
temper
about
something
so
it
struck
me
all
of
a
sudden
that
here
was
a
chance
to
scatter
a
little
merriment
her
way
and
see
if
she
d
pick
it
up
so
i
just
said
what
are
you
laughing
at
miss
dennison
and
then
i
began
to
i
don
t
see
how
you
dared
said
editha
what
did
she
say
why
at
first
she
looked
at
me
in
amazement
and
then
as
i
was
chuckling
with
laughter
somehow
she
had
to
smile
too
and
really
girls
when
she
smiles
she
looks
almost
pretty
well
by
that
time
we
had
reached
our
floor
so
we
both
got
off
and
walked
along
the
hall
together
laughing
she
said
and
she
glared
at
me
fearfully
indeed
i
m
not
laughing
i
m
angry
enough
and
she
was
so
angry
she
couldn
t
think
what
she
was
angry
enough
to
do
the
more
excited
she
got
the
more
i
laughed
partly
because
i
wanted
to
make
her
laugh
too
and
partly
because
she
was
so
funny
when
we
reached
her
apartment
she
was
still
blustering
and
informing
me
how
angry
she
was
though
i
had
no
idea
what
it
was
all
about
then
she
said
just
come
in
here
a
minute
and
i
ll
show
see
if
you
wouldn
t
be
angry
too
so
she
took
me
into
her
room
and
there
on
the
bed
lay
the
most
beautiful
dress
you
ever
saw
it
was
black
lace
with
spangles
all
over
it
and
twists
of
velvet
here
and
there
look
at
that
she
cried
look
at
that
so
i
looked
at
it
and
i
laughed
some
more
and
i
said
why
it
s
a
beautiful
gown
i
don
t
see
anything
about
that
to
make
you
so
and
then
she
said
oh
you
don
t
don
t
you
well
just
let
me
tell
you
that
my
dressmaker
has
just
sent
it
home
and
i
expected
to
wear
it
this
evening
when
i
m
to
make
an
address
at
a
meeting
of
the
federation
and
i
can
t
wear
it
girls
the
tragickness
of
her
face
and
voice
as
she
said
that
really
made
me
stop
laughing
i
said
why
not
in
an
whisper
then
she
explained
that
it
didn
t
fit
it
was
too
long
in
the
waist
and
too
short
in
the
skirt
and
too
tight
in
the
neck
and
too
loose
in
the
sleeves
maybe
i
haven
t
the
details
just
right
but
anyhow
everything
seemed
to
be
the
matter
with
it
so
you
see
it
was
a
clear
case
for
our
society
to
deal
with
and
i
set
to
work
first
i
found
out
that
she
really
couldn
t
wear
it
and
that
she
had
just
come
home
from
the
dressmaker
s
and
the
dressmaker
had
said
that
it
couldn
t
be
refitted
for
last
evening
though
it
could
be
done
later
so
i
asked
her
what
other
gowns
she
had
to
wear
and
she
showed
me
heaps
of
them
so
then
i
just
made
fun
of
her
i
don
t
know
myself
how
i
dared
do
it
but
i
really
teased
her
i
told
her
that
for
a
woman
who
was
interested
in
such
great
subjects
as
suffragists
and
things
like
that
to
care
what
dress
she
wore
was
perfectly
ridiculous
and
i
told
her
that
any
of
those
other
gowns
would
do
just
as
well
and
she
knew
it
and
i
told
her
that
later
she
could
have
this
new
one
fixed
over
and
address
some
other
meeting
in
it
and
i
joked
and
giggled
until
somehow
she
really
got
into
a
good
humour
and
said
she
supposed
her
heliotrope
velvet
would
do
just
as
well
after
all
and
when
i
came
away
she
was
awfully
nice
and
she
thanked
me
and
said
i
was
a
real
mark
tapley
and
now
my
i
hate
to
confess
my
ignorance
but
can
any
of
you
tell
me
what
is
a
mark
tapley
hilda
henderson
stared
at
patty
in
amazement
do
you
really
mean
she
said
that
you
don
t
know
mark
tapley
why
he
s
one
of
dickens
well
you
see
said
patty
i
never
read
but
three
of
dickens
books
and
he
wasn
t
in
those
what
did
he
do
why
he
s
a
character
in
martin
chuzzlewit
and
he
s
a
man
who
was
always
jolly
under
any
circumstances
the
more
depressing
the
situation
the
jollier
he
grew
he
said
it
was
no
credit
to
anybody
to
be
jolly
when
everything
went
right
the
great
feat
was
to
be
jolly
when
things
went
i
like
him
said
patty
decidedly
he
was
a
true
grig
and
i
d
like
to
know
more
of
him
i
ll
tell
you
what
girls
some
time
let
s
read
about
him
aloud
at
one
of
our
yes
we
will
agreed
hilda
but
i
say
patty
i
think
your
performance
with
miss
dennison
was
fine
if
you
could
make
that
spinster
laugh
you
needn
t
ever
be
afraid
to
tackle
anybody
now
flossy
you
come
next
what
have
you
been
up
to
this
week
my
experience
isn
t
as
interesting
as
patty
s
said
flossy
i
tried
it
on
grandpa
he
lives
with
us
you
know
and
he
has
the
gout
sometimes
it
s
worse
than
others
and
this
week
he
had
an
awful
attack
and
jiminy
crickets
if
he
wasn
t
cross
now
generally
when
he
gets
rampageous
i
just
keep
out
of
the
way
but
this
time
i
thought
i
d
play
grig
so
i
staid
around
and
when
he
burst
forth
in
his
angry
tantrums
i
just
laughed
and
said
some
foolish
funny
thing
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
i
read
up
the
comic
papers
to
get
jokes
to
spring
on
him
and
once
or
twice
i
read
him
funny
stories
out
of
the
magazines
it
didn
t
always
succeed
but
lots
of
times
i
get
him
into
a
better
temper
and
once
he
said
i
made
him
forget
the
pain
that
s
a
very
nice
experience
flossy
and
i
think
you
were
lovely
said
clementine
in
her
impulsive
way
i
really
believe
our
society
is
going
to
do
good
in
the
world
as
well
as
other
missionaries
now
i
ll
tell
what
i
did
there
s
nobody
in
our
house
that
s
cross
except
the
cook
and
she
is
a
terror
why
positively
mamma
doesn
t
dare
cross
her
the
least
bit
she
s
not
only
and
has
a
habit
of
flying
into
fearful
rages
but
she
s
sullen
and
right
along
well
a
few
nights
ago
mamma
was
giving
a
and
she
wanted
awfully
to
give
nora
some
directions
how
to
do
some
things
but
she
knew
nora
wanted
to
do
them
another
way
and
she
just
didn
t
dare
tell
her
to
i
wouldn
t
have
such
a
cook
as
that
exclaimed
adelaide
indignantly
yes
you
would
said
clementine
if
she
was
perfect
every
other
way
mamma
puts
up
with
her
temper
because
she
s
such
a
good
servant
well
anyhow
i
went
down
into
the
kitchen
that
morning
and
cracked
a
few
jokes
with
nora
and
she
has
the
real
irish
sense
of
humour
so
i
got
her
laughing
until
she
was
for
the
time
being
in
a
amiable
frame
of
mind
then
i
ran
upstairs
and
told
mamma
that
if
she
went
down
quick
before
the
effects
wore
off
i
believed
she
could
make
nora
do
anything
she
wanted
her
to
and
sure
enough
nora
was
still
smiling
when
mamma
went
down
and
she
took
the
orders
as
meek
as
a
lamb
and
mamma
was
so
you
re
all
right
clementine
said
editha
but
you
see
we
ve
lived
in
the
wilberforce
and
we
don
t
have
any
servants
of
our
own
and
of
course
we
can
t
joke
and
giggle
with
the
hotel
servants
so
adelaide
and
i
thought
we
d
try
it
on
jeannette
because
she
certainly
is
a
cross
child
and
then
somehow
that
seemed
sort
of
mean
for
quite
often
adelaide
and
i
are
cross
too
we
don
t
mean
anything
but
we
just
snip
each
other
and
the
other
snaps
back
and
it
isn
t
very
nice
so
all
three
of
us
decided
to
jolly
each
other
and
now
whenever
one
of
us
says
anything
cross
the
other
two
begin
to
giggle
and
first
thing
we
know
we
re
all
good
for
you
girls
cried
patty
clapping
her
hands
i
ve
always
said
the
harts
were
the
nicest
girls
i
know
except
that
they
were
so
snippy
toward
each
other
goodness
me
i
believe
this
society
is
going
to
make
angels
of
us
all
now
mary
sargent
it
s
your
turn
what
s
your
thrilling
tale
it
isn
t
very
thrilling
said
mary
but
it
s
the
best
i
could
do
you
see
we
live
in
an
apartment
hotel
too
and
i
haven
t
anybody
that
needs
cheering
up
but
one
day
i
noticed
that
the
chambermaid
was
a
most
sad
and
individual
so
when
she
comes
into
the
rooms
mornings
now
i
laugh
and
joke
with
her
a
little
and
it
seems
to
do
her
good
she
s
pleasanter
in
every
way
and
even
if
she
comes
in
glum
she
always
goes
out
smiling
she
s
a
swede
or
something
like
that
and
i
can
t
always
understand
what
she
says
but
the
other
day
i
gave
her
a
calendar
i
had
with
funny
pictures
on
it
and
she
told
me
that
she
looks
over
the
whole
twelve
every
morning
and
then
when
she
thinks
of
them
through
the
day
it
makes
her
that
s
a
rudimentary
sense
of
humour
said
clementine
laughing
but
it
seems
to
be
a
step
in
the
right
direction
let
the
good
work
go
on
mary
i
thought
you
d
take
it
more
seriously
than
the
rest
of
us
and
very
likely
you
ll
accomplish
the
mary
sargent
was
a
shy
girl
and
she
blushed
at
clementine
s
praise
but
her
eyes
twinkled
with
humour
and
clementine
said
she
was
a
dear
and
the
very
merriest
grig
of
them
all
chapter
xii
a
visit
to
the
hospital
well
said
hilda
i
m
not
sure
that
i
ought
to
be
president
of
the
grigs
after
all
for
i
have
to
confess
that
i
couldn
t
find
anybody
to
make
fun
for
except
our
old
cat
but
if
you
could
see
her
i
m
sure
you
d
agree
that
she
s
a
worthy
object
she
s
so
old
that
she
s
both
blind
and
deaf
and
she
s
so
melancholy
that
it
s
enough
to
make
you
weep
to
look
at
her
i
amused
her
and
played
with
her
and
tried
to
make
her
think
she
was
a
kitten
again
but
it
was
no
go
and
i
finally
had
to
resort
to
one
of
those
patent
that
worked
like
a
charm
and
in
a
few
moments
she
was
rolling
around
in
glee
and
cutting
up
all
sorts
of
antics
so
you
see
what
perseverance
will
far
be
it
from
me
said
patty
to
criticise
the
deeds
of
our
worthy
president
and
i
suppose
cats
want
some
fun
in
their
lives
as
well
as
they
ought
to
have
nine
times
as
much
said
hilda
for
they
have
nine
lives
and
we
have
only
i
ve
nothing
more
to
say
said
patty
our
president
has
quite
justified
herself
and
her
effort
was
nine
times
as
meritorious
as
any
of
well
i
think
the
whole
thing
is
fun
said
clementine
and
next
week
i
mean
to
do
something
startling
i
think
i
ll
go
and
call
on
our
minister
he
is
the
solemnest
man
i
know
and
i
d
just
like
to
see
if
he
laugh
i
ll
take
alice
in
wonderland
and
read
aloud
to
him
and
see
if
i
can
make
him
lewis
carroll
was
a
clergyman
himself
said
hilda
so
probably
your
minister
is
familiar
with
his
probably
he
isn
t
returned
clementine
you
don
t
know
our
minister
i
don
t
believe
he
ever
read
anything
more
frivolous
than
foxe
s
book
of
martyrs
or
the
lamentations
of
then
do
go
said
flossy
and
i
ll
go
with
you
it
would
take
two
of
us
to
make
a
man
like
that
smile
but
i
ve
finished
this
and
my
but
it
s
a
pretty
one
observe
those
yellow
daffodils
on
the
cover
and
the
lion
under
them
that
s
a
most
humorous
decoration
besides
being
artistically
ridiculous
exclaimed
editha
looking
at
the
book
flossy
held
up
so
proudly
it
s
enough
to
make
a
cat
laugh
then
i
ll
send
it
home
to
hilda
s
cat
said
flossy
quickly
it
may
help
to
brighten
one
of
her
nine
sad
by
this
time
it
was
nearly
noon
and
though
they
had
enjoyed
the
work
the
girls
were
nevertheless
pleased
when
they
saw
a
maid
come
in
at
the
door
with
a
large
tray
which
held
seven
cups
of
cocoa
and
plates
of
sandwiches
do
you
know
that
tray
makes
me
laugh
more
than
these
with
all
their
pictures
said
clementine
yes
it
s
the
merriest
thing
i
ve
seen
this
morning
said
adelaide
it
really
puts
me
in
quite
a
good
humour
i
wouldn
t
even
be
cross
with
editha
just
the
grigs
did
full
justice
to
morse
s
hospitality
and
then
that
lady
herself
came
into
the
she
was
most
enthusiastic
over
the
girls
morning
work
and
quite
agreed
that
they
were
true
missionaries
in
their
chosen
field
and
now
she
said
i
have
an
omnibus
at
the
door
and
if
you
ll
all
bundle
into
it
i
ll
take
you
around
to
the
hospital
for
the
matron
telephoned
that
we
might
come
between
twelve
and
one
o
clock
i
have
been
hunting
up
a
lot
of
comic
papers
and
humorous
books
to
take
along
and
i
have
some
flowers
too
for
there
are
some
people
who
are
too
ill
to
read
but
who
can
be
cheered
by
fresh
patty
looked
admiringly
at
morse
who
was
a
lady
after
her
own
heart
and
more
than
ever
she
felt
reminded
of
aunt
alice
the
girls
gathered
up
their
and
dolls
and
toys
and
found
to
their
delight
that
they
had
a
large
basketful
downstairs
they
went
donned
their
hats
and
coats
and
started
for
the
hospital
the
big
roomy
vehicle
held
the
eight
easily
and
they
laughed
and
chattered
in
a
fashion
quite
suited
to
their
avowed
character
morse
had
explained
the
situation
to
miss
bidwell
the
hospital
matron
and
that
good
lady
was
pleased
to
see
the
seven
merry
grigs
cautioning
them
to
be
quiet
while
going
through
the
halls
she
led
them
to
the
convalescent
ward
where
a
score
or
more
children
looked
at
them
wonderingly
the
girls
had
arranged
their
programme
beforehand
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
where
all
the
little
patients
could
see
her
flossy
recited
some
funny
poetry
her
happy
smiling
face
and
her
comical
words
and
gestures
proved
quite
as
amusing
as
the
girls
had
hoped
and
the
little
sick
children
laughed
aloud
in
glee
then
clementine
sang
some
and
after
that
hilda
told
a
funny
story
hilda
was
a
born
mimic
and
her
representation
of
the
different
characters
pleased
the
children
greatly
after
this
the
girls
went
around
separately
to
the
various
little
cots
and
talked
to
the
invalids
personally
there
were
so
many
of
the
children
that
in
order
not
to
neglect
any
the
interview
was
necessarily
short
with
each
one
but
there
was
time
for
a
little
merry
conversation
with
each
besides
presenting
the
gifts
they
had
brought
patty
was
particularly
attracted
by
a
little
boy
about
eight
years
old
who
had
broken
his
leg
the
little
fellow
s
face
was
white
and
drawn
with
suffering
and
his
sad
eyes
made
him
seem
far
older
than
he
really
was
instinctively
patty
made
up
her
mind
to
bring
all
the
pleasure
and
merriment
into
that
child
s
life
that
she
possibly
could
and
just
because
he
seemed
to
be
the
forlornest
specimen
of
humanity
present
she
resolved
to
make
him
her
special
charge
his
name
he
said
was
tommy
skelling
and
his
leg
had
been
broken
in
a
trolley
accident
but
it
was
a
compound
fracture
and
caused
the
boy
almost
continuous
pain
and
suffering
it
seemed
especially
pathetic
even
to
try
to
make
the
little
chap
laugh
but
patty
felt
sure
that
diversion
would
do
him
more
good
than
sympathy
so
she
told
him
the
funniest
story
she
knew
and
picked
out
the
funniest
for
him
she
was
rewarded
by
finding
him
very
appreciative
and
succeeded
in
making
him
forget
his
pain
for
the
moment
and
laugh
heartily
at
her
fun
as
the
girls
were
taking
leave
tommy
confided
to
patty
his
opinion
of
the
club
you
re
the
nicest
one
he
said
but
pointing
a
skinny
little
finger
at
flossy
she
s
the
prettiest
and
she
indicating
clementine
in
the
same
way
she
s
the
grandest
but
she
s
nice
you
re
all
nice
and
i
hope
you
ll
come
again
soon
and
i
wish
i
could
have
one
of
those
peanut
luckily
there
was
an
extra
doll
left
and
it
was
given
to
tommy
who
laughed
outright
at
the
grotesque
toy
well
that
performance
was
certainly
a
screaming
success
said
adelaide
as
they
were
all
in
the
omnibus
going
home
it
was
indeed
said
morse
and
i
think
you
girls
are
to
be
congratulated
on
your
good
somehow
it
just
happened
said
patty
we
began
this
society
more
with
the
idea
of
having
fun
ourselves
and
now
the
main
object
seems
to
be
to
make
fun
for
i
think
we
can
do
both
said
flossy
and
next
week
i
want
you
all
to
come
to
my
house
and
not
bring
any
work
we
can
make
and
things
at
some
meetings
but
next
time
we
re
just
going
to
that
s
all
right
said
hilda
suddenly
assuming
her
presidential
air
of
course
we
re
not
going
to
work
at
every
meeting
but
remember
through
the
week
we
re
to
scatter
all
the
fun
we
can
and
liven
up
the
world
in
general
and
i
ll
try
to
find
somebody
besides
a
cat
next
morse
and
clementine
went
around
with
the
girls
and
left
each
one
at
her
home
patty
went
flying
in
to
her
own
apartment
in
quest
of
grandma
oh
she
exclaimed
we
had
a
perfectly
lovely
meeting
and
morse
is
a
dear
she
took
us
to
the
hospital
in
an
omnibus
and
we
made
all
the
little
sick
children
laugh
and
they
enjoyed
it
ever
so
much
and
so
did
we
i
wish
papa
would
come
home
i
want
to
tell
him
all
about

isn
t
coming

said
grandma
elliott
smiling
at
the
excited
appearance
of
her
young
charge

wait

for
a
few
moments
about

and
he
said

room
what
a
dear
good
grandma
you

they
were
spry
and
were
fortunate
enough
to
catch
a
fast
train
so
that
by
four
o
clock
they
were
at
aunt
alice
s
marian
had
gone
to
the
tea
club
which
met
that
day
at
elsie
morris
s
and
after
waiting
only
for
a
few
words
with
aunt
alice
and
the
little
children
patty
flew
over
to
elsie
s
such
a
hullabaloo
as
greeted
her
arrival
as
patty
said
afterwards
the
girls
couldn
t
have
made
more
fuss
over
her
if
she
had
been
queen
of
the
cannibal
islands
i
m
glad
you
came
said
ethel
holmes
for
the
dozenth
time
as
she
hovered
around
patty

single
thing

ve
done
since

in
new
york

the
girls

a
tea
club

you

hotel

t

a
minute
ethel
cried
patty
laughing
before
you
go
any
further
that
is
if
you
want
your
questions
answered
i
guess
i
ll
answer
the
last
one
first
of
course
i
miss
you
girls
awfully
not
but
what
the
girls
there
are
nice
enough
but
i
want
you
too
i
wish
you
d
all
come
and
live
in
new
marian
said
very
little
but
sat
and
held
patty
s
hand
as
if
afraid
she
might
run
away
marian
was
devotedly
attached
to
her
cousin
and
missed
her
more
than
anybody
had
any
idea
of
excepting
aunt
alice
but
tell
us
about
it
all
said
polly
stevens
do
you
go
to
the
theatre
every
night
goodness
no
exclaimed
patty
of
course
not
i
don
t
go
at
all
except
when
papa
took
me
to
a
matinée
once
and
he
says
i
may
go
two
or
three
more
times
during
the
winter
no
ethel
we
don
t
have
a
tea
club
but
we
have
a
club
called
the
what
a
crazy
name
exclaimed
elsie
what
does
it
mean
so
patty
explained
all
about
the
grigs
and
their
aims
and
their
work
and
play
i
think
it
s
lovely
said
polly
stevens
and
i
do
think
you
have
beautiful
times
just
think
of
your
all
going
to
the
hospital
together
in
an
i
didn
t
say
ambulance
polly
i
said
omnibus
said
patty
as
the
girls
went
off
into
shrieks
of
laughter
well
it
s
all
the
same
said
polly
quite
unabashed
you
all
went
together
in
some
big
vehicle
and
i
think
that
s
it
was
fun
said
patty
and
it
was
lovely
to
see
the
poor
little
sick
children
brighten
up
and
laugh
merrily
in
spite
of
their
pain
and
i
think
girls
said
marian
that
it
would
be
nice
for
the
tea
club
to
make
some
and
dolls
and
things
and
send
them
in
to
the
grigs
for
them
to
take
to
the
marian
you
re
a
darling
said
patty
affectionately
squeezing
her
cousin
s
hand
it
will
be
perfectly
lovely
if
you
only
would
for
we
can
use
any
amount
of
those
things
and
you
would
be
doing
such
a
lot
of
good
to
those
poor
little
and
thus
the
good
influence
and
helpful
work
of
the
grigs
was
widened
in
a
manner
quite
unexpected
chapter
xiii
elise
in
order
that
patty
might
get
home
in
time
for
school
on
monday
morning
she
and
grandma
were
obliged
to
take
a
very
early
train
from
vernondale
so
marian
and
frank
went
down
with
them
to
see
them
safely
on
the
seven
train
and
brownie
the
dog
accompanied
them
as
usual
marian
was
loath
to
let
patty
go
and
clung
to
her
until
the
last
minute
frank
had
already
established
grandma
in
the
train
and
the
conductor
was
about
to
ring
the
bell
when
at
the
last
minute
patty
jumped
on
the
train
was
almost
starting
but
the
conductor
assisted
patty
and
she
seated
herself
beside
grandma
quite
out
of
breath
from
her
hasty
entrance
i
just
hated
to
leave
marian
she
said
for
she
did
seem
so
sorry
to
have
me
go
but
i
promised
to
come
back
here
to
spend
thanksgiving
or
else
to
have
her
spend
it
with
me
in
new
york
and
that
seemed
to
help
matters
a
you
d
better
have
her
plan
to
come
to
see
you
said
grandma
for
i
think
your
father
expects
that
nan
will
be
in
new
york
about
that
all
right
said
patty
i
don
t
care
as
long
as
marian
and
i
are
together
but
for
goodness
sake
grandma
will
you
look
at
that
now
that
was
nothing
more
nor
less
than
brownie
the
dog
sitting
in
the
aisle
blinking
at
them
and
contentedly
wagging
his
tail
how
did
he
get
there
said
grandma
with
a
bewildered
helpless
air
i
don
t
know
said
patty
laughing
but
there
he
is
and
now
the
question
is
what
shall
we
do
with
him
brownie
seemed
intelligently
interested
in
this
question
and
continued
to
wag
his
tail
and
blink
at
patty
with
an
expression
on
his
funny
old
dog
face
that
was
very
like
a
wink
marian
will
be
worried
to
death
said
grandma
with
an
air
of
consternation
of
course
she
will
assented
patty
cheerfully
but
that
isn
t
the
worst
of
it
the
thing
is
what
are
we
to
do
with
him
now
you
know
they
don
t
allow
dogs
on
the
i
never
thought
of
that
said
grandma
helplessly
will
he
have
to
go
in
the
there
isn
t
any
on
this
train
we
ll
either
have
to
throw
him
out
of
the
window
or
hide
all
right
we
ll
hide
him
and
grandma
coaxed
brownie
to
jump
up
into
her
lap
then
she
pulled
her
over
him
until
he
was
entirely
concealed
from
view
but
the
inquisitive
conductor
insisted
on
knowing
what
had
become
of
the
dog
that
followed
these
particular
ladies
on
the
train
he
s
here
exclaimed
grandma
throwing
open
her
cloak
and
showing
the
quivering
animal
he
must
be
put
off
said
the
conductor
sternly
we
do
not
want
dogs
on
the
all
right
said
patty
cheerfully
neither
do
we
and
the
sooner
you
put
him
off
and
us
with
him
the
better
it
will
be
all
around
for
you
see
grandma
she
went
on
we
ve
got
to
take
brownie
back
to
vernondale
marian
will
have
four
thousand
fits
if
we
don
t
and
besides
we
couldn
t
possibly
take
him
to
the
grandma
said
nothing
the
emergency
was
too
much
for
her
to
cope
with
and
she
was
glad
to
depend
on
patty
s
advice
so
patty
said
to
the
conductor
please
put
us
off
just
as
soon
as
you
can
for
we
have
to
take
this
dog
back
to
but
with
the
characteristic
perversity
of
conductors
he
said
no
stop
miss
until
elizabeth
you
can
get
off
of
this
was
nearly
half
way
to
new
york
city
but
there
was
no
other
way
out
of
it
so
as
patty
cheerfully
remarked
to
grandma
they
might
as
well
make
up
their
minds
to
get
off
at
elizabeth
and
take
brownie
back
to
vernondale
of
course
patty
went
on
i
shall
be
late
to
school
and
i
ll
lose
a
mark
and
that
ll
throw
clementine
ahead
of
me
in
the
count
for
we
have
been
just
even
up
to
now
but
i
can
t
help
it
marian
s
dog
must
be
taken
home
and
that
s
all
there
is
about
although
grandma
elliott
regretted
the
necessity
of
patty
s
losing
a
mark
for
she
well
knew
how
the
child
was
striving
for
the
grand
prize
yet
she
appreciated
and
admired
the
philosophy
which
made
the
best
of
inevitable
circumstances
and
she
agreed
with
patty
that
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
so
at
elizabeth
they
got
off
of
the
train
and
with
some
difficulty
persuaded
brownie
to
get
off
too
at
this
station
it
was
necessary
to
cross
under
the
elevated
tracks
to
take
the
train
in
the
opposite
direction
brownie
being
ignorant
of
the
imperative
necessities
of
travel
objected
to
this
and
it
was
only
after
some
coaxing
that
patty
persuaded
him
to
accompany
them
meantime
there
was
consternation
at
the
vernondale
end
of
the
route
after
the
train
had
left
the
station
frank
and
marian
suddenly
realised
that
since
they
could
see
brownie
nowhere
around
he
must
have
gone
on
the
train
with
patty
what
will
they
do
queried
marian
they
can
t
take
him
to
new
york
and
i
know
they
won
t
abandon
him
so
of
course
they
ll
turn
around
and
bring
him
back
on
the
next
of
course
they
will
assented
frank
but
let
me
see
the
next
train
back
doesn
t
leave
elizabeth
until
now
if
i
take
the
i
can
head
them
off
and
they
won
t
have
to
come
that
s
a
great
scheme
said
marian
go
ahead
and
i
will
wait
here
until
you
come
so
frank
took
the
next
train
but
as
it
chanced
to
be
behind
time
he
reached
elizabeth
just
as
the
returning
train
was
pulling
out
of
the
station
with
patty
on
board
expecting
some
such
complication
patty
stood
on
the
platform
and
waved
her
hand
to
frank
whom
she
saw
on
the
incoming
train
brownie
s
all
right
she
cried
but
we
ll
have
to
go
back
now
we
re
yes
i
suppose
so
frank
called
back
realising
that
his
journey
had
been
for
nought
so
patty
and
grandma
and
the
dog
whizzed
into
the
vernondale
station
and
alighted
to
find
marian
tearful
and
almost
in
hysterics
i
m
so
glad
to
see
you
she
said
and
i
m
so
glad
to
see
brownie
and
frank
has
gone
to
elizabeth
and
patty
won
t
you
be
late
to
school
and
did
you
ever
know
such
a
performance
brownie
flew
around
like
mad
and
wagged
his
tail
as
if
he
quite
understood
that
he
was
the
hero
of
the
occasion
and
then
patty
and
grandma
took
the
next
train
to
new
york
city
and
marian
was
careful
that
brownie
should
not
accompany
them
this
time
and
so
that
s
how
it
happened
that
patty
was
late
to
school
for
the
first
time
and
that
one
mark
put
clementine
ahead
of
her
in
the
monthly
report
but
as
patty
told
her
father
she
couldn
t
help
the
dog
jumping
on
the
train
and
fairfield
agreed
that
that
was
quite
true
when
patty
finally
did
reach
school
that
monday
morning
she
saw
that
a
new
pupil
had
arrived
this
girl
as
patty
first
noticed
her
in
the
literature
class
was
exceedingly
pretty
with
large
dark
eyes
and
curly
dark
hair
and
a
general
air
of
daring
and
somehow
patty
felt
that
she
didn
t
quite
approve
of
her
and
yet
at
the
same
time
she
felt
fascinated
and
mysteriously
attracted
toward
the
stranger
it
was
not
until
the
noon
hour
that
she
learned
that
the
new
girl
s
name
was
elise
farrington
none
of
the
girls
seemed
inclined
to
talk
to
the
newcomer
and
patty
with
a
vivid
realisation
of
her
own
feelings
the
first
day
of
her
arrival
at
the
oliphant
school
determined
to
do
all
she
could
toward
making
the
new
arrival
feel
at
home
so
at
she
went
to
her
and
said
they
tell
me
you
are
elise
farrington
and
that
this
is
your
first
day
at
the
oliphant
school
i
well
remember
my
first
day
and
so
i
want
to
say
to
you
that
if
i
can
do
anything
for
you
or
introduce
you
to
anybody
that
you
d
care
to
know
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
do
elise
looked
at
patty
gratefully
you
re
awfully
good
she
said
but
truly
there
s
nobody
i
had
any
especial
desire
to
be
introduced
to
except
you
so
suppose
you
introduce
patty
laughed
i
m
patty
fairfield
she
said
but
i
m
not
especially
desirable
to
know
let
me
introduce
you
to
some
of
the
other
no
said
elise
you
re
the
one
i
picked
out
in
the
classroom
as
the
only
one
i
thought
i
should
really
like
have
you
any
especial
chum
why
not
exactly
said
patty
smiling
i
m
chums
with
everybody
but
i
ll
tell
you
what
you
re
new
and
of
course
you
feel
a
little
strange
now
it
happens
that
the
girl
who
usually
sits
next
to
me
at
luncheon
isn
t
here
so
you
come
and
sit
by
me
and
then
you
ll
get
a
good
patty
remembered
how
glad
she
would
have
been
had
someone
talked
to
her
like
that
on
the
first
day
of
her
arrival
at
the
school
and
she
put
elise
in
lorraine
s
place
glad
that
she
could
so
favour
her
during
luncheon
patty
entertained
the
new
pupil
with
an
account
of
her
funny
experience
with
brownie
that
morning
and
she
found
in
elise
an
appreciative
listener
to
her
recital
at
the
same
time
patty
could
not
quite
make
up
her
mind
as
to
the
social
status
of
the
new
girl
elise
seemed
to
be
of
the
wealthy
and
somewhat
supercilious
class
typified
in
the
oliphant
school
by
gertrude
lyons
and
maude
carleton
and
yet
elise
seemed
far
more
simple
and
natural
than
those
artificial
young
women
and
patty
concluded
that
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
she
belonged
to
one
of
new
york
s
families
she
was
unostentatious
and
in
no
sense
for
with
all
her
sophistication
and
general
effect
of
affluence
patty
seemed
to
see
an
undercurrent
of
dissatisfaction
of
some
sort
not
that
elise
was
sad
or
far
from
it
she
was
merry
frivolous
and
quite
inclined
to
make
fun
of
her
did
you
ever
see
anything
so
ridiculous
as
gertrude
lyons
she
asked
of
patty
she
is
so
airy
and
conceited
and
yet
she
s
nothing
after
although
patty
did
not
especially
like
gertrude
this
challenge
roused
her
sense
of
justice
and
she
said
oh
gertrude
is
all
right
and
i
don
t
think
it
is
nice
to
criticise
strangers
like
gertrude
s
no
stranger
to
me
said
elise
i
ve
known
her
all
my
life
they
live
within
a
block
of
us
but
we
never
have
liked
each
other
i
like
you
a
lot
although
patty
was
gratified
by
this
frank
appreciation
of
herself
she
didn
t
quite
understand
elise
for
she
seemed
such
a
peculiar
combination
of
flattery
and
cynicism
after
luncheon
was
over
patty
introduced
her
to
the
other
grigs
the
description
of
the
society
and
its
intents
seemed
to
appeal
especially
to
elise
and
she
exclaimed
oh
let
me
join
it
let
me
be
a
grig
and
we
can
meet
in
the
casino
and
have
no
end
of
what
casino
asked
patty
what
do
you
mean
why
explained
elise
we
have
a
private
casino
of
our
own
you
know
it
s
right
next
door
to
our
house
and
connects
on
every
but
what
is
it
asked
clementine
i
don
t
why
it
s
just
another
house
father
bought
it
you
know
and
then
fixed
it
up
for
us
all
to
have
all
sorts
of
fun
in
there
s
a
and
a
and
a
bowling
alley
and
all
sorts
of
sports
and
games
oh
just
come
to
see
it
that
s
all
and
you
ll
understand
better
than
i
can
tell
of
course
we
ll
come
said
clementine
who
was
always
the
pioneer
when
can
we
come
why
thursday
is
my
day
said
elise
you
see
there
are
five
of
us
children
and
we
each
have
the
casino
on
a
given
day
and
may
invite
whom
we
like
in
the
evenings
my
father
and
mother
invite
their
i
think
it
s
the
loveliest
scheme
i
ever
heard
of
said
patty
and
i
m
sure
we
d
all
love
to
come
on
thursday
but
as
to
making
you
a
grig
i
m
not
so
sure
are
you
always
merry
merry
i
should
say
i
am
why
the
family
say
i
never
stop
giggling
oh
goodness
gracious
i
m
merry
enough
the
trouble
is
to
make
me
serious
when
occasion
really
demands
it
why
i
m
always
at
the
very
topnotch
of
it
seems
to
me
said
hilda
falling
into
her
presidential
attitude
that
we
might
let
elise
be
the
eighth
grig
until
lorraine
is
ready
to
join
and
she
certainly
isn
t
she
certainly
is
not
said
patty
as
she
remembered
lorraine
s
cross
greeting
that
morning
and
i
think
your
idea
is
all
chapter
xiv
the
casino
on
the
whole
elise
wore
rather
well
although
belonging
to
the
millionaire
classes
of
the
city
she
was
simple
and
unaffected
and
never
referred
to
her
wealth
by
word
or
implication
from
the
first
she
was
devoted
to
patty
and
in
spite
of
her
many
peculiarities
patty
thoroughly
liked
her
clementine
considered
her
cranky
and
adelaide
thought
her
too
much
inclined
to
dictate
but
elise
was
entirely
indifferent
to
their
opinions
and
independently
followed
her
own
sweet
will
if
she
wanted
things
done
a
certain
way
she
said
so
and
somehow
they
were
done
that
way
if
the
other
girls
objected
she
quietly
ignored
their
objections
and
proceeded
serenely
on
her
course
the
result
of
this
was
that
the
others
regarded
her
with
mingled
dissatisfaction
and
admiration
neither
of
which
at
all
affected
elise
she
made
one
exception
of
patty
she
was
always
willing
to
defer
to
patty
s
wishes
or
change
her
plans
in
accordance
with
patty
s
ideas
still
as
elise
was
so
generous
and
entertaining
the
girls
really
liked
her
and
she
proved
to
be
a
real
acquisition
to
the
society
of
grigs
on
thursday
afternoon
she
invited
them
all
to
go
home
with
her
and
play
in
the
casino
the
girls
went
directly
from
school
and
a
short
walk
brought
them
to
elise
s
home
the
farrington
house
was
really
a
mansion
and
by
far
the
most
magnificent
and
imposing
dwelling
that
patty
had
ever
been
in
the
eight
girls
ran
up
the
steps
and
the
door
was
opened
by
a
footman
in
livery
the
great
hall
seemed
to
patty
like
a
glimpse
into
fairyland
its
massive
staircase
wound
around
in
a
bewildering
way
and
beautiful
palms
and
statues
stood
all
about
the
light
fell
softly
through
windows
and
to
patty
s
soul
it
all
seemed
a
perfect
elysium
of
form
and
colour
she
almost
held
her
breath
as
she
looked
but
elise
seemed
to
take
it
as
a
matter
of
course
and
said
come
on
into
the
library
girls
and
leave
your
books
and
the
library
was
another
revelation
of
art
and
beauty
and
patty
wondered
if
the
other
girls
were
as
much
impressed
as
herself
by
elise
s
home
it
was
not
only
that
unlimited
wealth
had
been
used
in
the
building
and
furnishing
but
somebody
s
exquisite
and
educated
taste
had
directed
the
expenditure
and
it
was
this
that
appealed
so
strongly
to
patty
though
she
did
not
herself
understand
it
there
was
another
occupant
of
the
library
whom
elise
presented
as
her
brother
roger
he
was
a
boy
of
about
nineteen
with
dark
hair
and
eyes
like
his
sister
s
and
a
kind
frank
face
he
greeted
the
girls
pleasantly
without
a
trace
of
awkwardness
but
after
a
few
casual
remarks
he
turned
aside
from
the
laughing
group
and
stared
moodily
out
of
the
window
poor
old
roger
said
elise
to
patty
in
a
low
voice
he
s
in
a
most
awful
fit
of
the
blues
do
go
and
say
a
few
cheering
words
to
him
there
s
a
good
always
ready
to
cast
a
ray
of
sunshine
into
anybody
s
life
patty
went
toward
the
boy
how
can
you
look
so
sad
she
said
with
a
whole
room
full
of
merry
grigs
because
i
m
not
a
grig
i
suppose
said
roger
he
spoke
politely
enough
but
seemed
not
at
all
anxious
to
pursue
the
conversation
but
patty
was
not
so
easily
daunted
of
course
you
can
t
be
a
member
of
our
society
she
said
but
couldn
t
you
be
just
a
little
bit
griggy
on
your
own
account
my
own
account
doesn
t
call
for
grigginess
just
at
why
not
oh
i
have
troubles
of
my
all
the
more
reason
for
being
merry
how
do
you
expect
to
get
the
better
of
your
troubles
if
you
don
t
have
fun
with
them
roger
looked
at
her
with
a
little
more
interest
the
trouble
that
s
bothering
me
hasn
t
come
yet
he
said
it
s
only
an
anticipation
then
perhaps
it
never
will
come
and
you
might
as
well
be
merry
and
take
your
no
it
s
bound
to
come
and
there
s
nothing
merry
about
it
it
s
just
horrid
won
t
you
tell
me
what
it
is
said
patty
gently
seeing
that
the
boy
was
very
much
in
earnest
would
you
really
like
to
know
yes
indeed
perhaps
i
could
help
roger
smiled
no
he
said
you
can
t
help
me
nobody
can
help
me
it
s
only
this
i
ve
got
to
have
my
arm
what
exclaimed
patty
looking
at
the
stalwart
youth
in
amazement
who
s
going
to
break
it
i
don
t
know
whether
to
go
to
the
circus
and
let
a
lion
break
it
or
whether
to
fall
out
of
an
automobile
and
roger
smiled
quizzically
at
patty
s
bewildered
face
oh
you
re
only
fooling
she
said
with
a
look
of
relief
i
thought
you
were
in
and
so
i
am
said
roger
more
seriously
this
is
the
truth
i
broke
my
arm
playing
football
a
year
ago
and
when
it
was
set
it
didn
t
knit
right
or
it
wasn
t
set
right
or
something
and
now
i
can
t
bend
my
elbow
at
roger
raised
his
right
arm
and
showed
that
he
was
unable
to
bend
it
at
the
it
s
awfully
inconvenient
and
awkward
as
you
see
and
the
only
remedy
is
to
have
it
broken
and
set
over
again
and
so
that
s
the
proposition
i
m
up
and
a
mighty
hard
one
too
said
patty
with
a
sudden
rush
of
genuine
sympathy
are
you
going
to
the
hospital
yes
mother
wants
it
done
at
i
could
be
more
comfortable
and
all
that
but
i
d
rather
go
to
the
hospital
it
s
more
satisfactory
in
every
way
but
it
will
be
a
long
siege
now
miss
grig
do
you
see
anything
particularly
merry
in
the
outlook
will
the
breaking
part
hurt
asked
patty
no
i
shall
probably
be
unconscious
during
the
smash
but
what
i
dread
is
lying
still
for
several
weeks
bound
up
in
splints
and
i
can
t
play
in
the
game
this
you
couldn
t
anyway
if
you
didn
t
have
it
broken
could
you
no
of
course
and
you
never
can
play
football
again
if
you
don
t
have
it
broken
and
reset
well
then
the
outlook
is
decidedly
merry
the
idea
of
your
objecting
to
the
inconveniences
of
three
or
four
weeks
when
it
means
a
lifetime
of
comfort
and
convenience
whew
i
never
looked
at
it
in
just
that
light
before
but
i
more
than
half
believe
you
re
of
course
i
m
right
said
patty
stoutly
you
ve
got
to
look
at
things
in
their
true
proportion
and
the
proportion
of
a
few
weeks
in
the
hospital
against
a
good
arm
for
the
rest
of
your
life
is
very
small
i
can
tell
you
especially
as
you
will
have
the
best
possible
skill
and
care
and
every
comfort
and
luxury
that
can
be
procured
suppose
you
were
poor
and
had
to
go
to
some
free
hospital
and
have
inexperienced
doctors
practising
on
you
why
you
might
have
to
have
your
arm
broken
and
set
a
dozen
times
before
they
got
it
well
there
is
something
in
that
and
i
begin
to
believe
my
case
is
merrier
than
it
might
be
at
any
rate
miss
grig
you
ve
cheered
me
up
a
lot
and
i
m
duly
grateful
i
leave
home
for
the
merry
merry
hospital
so
i
can
only
hope
that
when
next
we
meet
i
can
raise
my
arm
and
shake
hands
with
you
a
little
more
gracefully
than
roger
put
out
his
stiff
arm
with
an
awkward
gesture
but
with
such
a
pleasant
smile
that
patty
shook
hands
heartily
and
said
i
hope
you
will
and
until
then
promise
me
that
you
ll
be
as
merry
as
a
grig
would
be
under
similar
i
ll
promise
to
try
said
roger
and
then
elise
carried
the
girls
all
off
to
the
casino
though
not
so
elaborately
furnished
as
the
farrington
home
the
casino
was
perfect
in
its
own
way
on
the
first
floor
which
they
entered
by
a
door
from
the
main
hall
of
the
farrington
house
was
a
large
tennis
court
and
in
the
apartment
next
to
that
a
squash
court
it
seemed
strange
to
see
these
courts
but
elise
told
the
girls
that
after
they
had
tried
them
she
felt
sure
they
would
like
them
quite
as
well
as
courts
at
any
rate
she
said
they
are
the
best
possible
on
the
floor
above
was
a
long
bowling
alley
a
and
a
bewildering
succession
of
other
rooms
some
fitted
up
with
paraphernalia
of
which
patty
did
not
even
know
the
use
but
she
was
greatly
impressed
with
the
kindness
of
a
father
who
would
fit
out
such
a
wonderful
place
of
delightful
recreation
for
his
children
it
isn
t
only
for
us
said
elise
as
patty
expressed
her
thoughts
aloud
father
and
mother
use
it
to
entertain
their
friends
in
the
evenings
there
is
a
and
a
and
up
at
the
top
a
big
but
of
course
we
children
just
use
these
lower
floor
rooms
for
our
games
and
things
now
shall
we
have
the
meeting
first
i
mean
the
regular
society
meeting
or
play
games
first
and
meet
afterwards
let
s
play
first
said
patty
because
we
mightn
t
have
time
for
this
was
unanimously
agreed
to
and
soon
the
grigs
were
quite
living
up
to
their
name
as
they
played
various
games
patty
elise
hilda
and
editha
played
tennis
at
first
and
afterwards
played
basketball
while
the
others
took
the
tennis
court
after
an
hour
or
more
of
this
vigorous
exercise
they
were
quite
ready
to
sit
down
and
rest
and
elise
said
now
we
will
all
go
and
sit
in
the
hall
and
have
our
this
hall
was
a
large
square
apartment
on
the
second
floor
there
was
an
immense
open
fireplace
where
great
logs
were
cheerfully
blazing
and
on
either
side
were
quaint
settles
large
and
roomy
and
on
these
the
girls
ranged
themselves
this
is
the
nicest
society
said
clementine
because
we
don
t
have
to
do
anything
at
any
particular
time
now
here
we
are
holding
a
meeting
on
thursday
when
saturday
is
our
regular
day
but
i
don
t
see
any
reason
why
we
shouldn
t
meet
any
day
that
happens
to
suit
i
think
so
too
said
hilda
we
haven
t
any
rules
and
we
don
t
want
any
has
anybody
any
plans
for
next
week
i
have
a
plan
said
elise
though
i
m
not
sure
we
can
arrange
it
for
next
week
but
some
day
i
think
it
would
be
nice
for
us
to
collect
a
lot
of
small
children
who
don
t
have
much
fun
in
their
lives
and
bring
them
here
for
a
morning
or
an
afternoon
in
the
casino
and
just
let
them
romp
and
play
all
they
that
s
a
beautiful
plan
elise
said
patty
her
eyes
shining
and
you
re
a
dear
to
think
of
it
is
your
mother
willing
yes
said
elise
she
wasn
t
awfully
anxious
to
let
me
do
it
at
first
but
i
coaxed
her
to
and
father
was
willing
so
he
helped
me
just
here
roger
appeared
carrying
a
large
box
of
candy
hope
i
don
t
intrude
he
said
in
his
graceful
boyish
way
and
i
won
t
stay
a
minute
but
i
thought
that
perhaps
even
merry
grigs
could
at
times
descend
to
prosaic
i
should
say
we
could
exclaimed
clementine
really
i
don
t
know
anything
merrier
than
a
box
of
you
re
a
perfect
duck
roger
to
bring
it
said
elise
but
you
must
run
away
now
for
we
can
t
have
boys
at
grig
meetings
there
s
nothing
merry
about
a
all
the
more
reason
then
said
roger
why
i
should
stay
and
be
no
you
can
t
said
his
sister
so
go
away
now
and
please
send
mother
here
she
said
she
d
come
and
meet
the
girls
so
tell
her
now
s
her
with
comical
expressions
of
unwillingness
roger
went
away
and
in
a
few
moments
farrington
came
she
was
an
lady
and
reminded
patty
a
little
of
aunt
isabel
clair
but
though
elaborately
dressed
her
gown
was
in
far
better
taste
than
aunt
isabel
s
gorgeous
raiment
and
though
her
manner
was
a
little
conventional
her
voice
was
low
and
sweet
and
her
smile
was
charming
she
did
not
talk
to
the
girls
individually
but
greeted
them
as
a
whole
and
welcomed
them
prettily
as
friends
of
her
daughter
then
she
presented
each
one
with
a
beautiful
little
pin
made
of
green
enamel
in
the
design
of
a
cricket
it
is
a
real
english
cricket
or
grig
she
said
and
i
instructed
the
jeweller
to
make
it
a
merry
her
orders
had
been
carried
out
for
the
little
green
grigs
were
jolly
looking
affairs
with
tiny
eyes
of
yellow
topaz
that
fairly
seemed
to
wink
and
blink
with
fun
the
girls
were
delighted
and
all
agreed
that
farrington
had
conferred
the
highest
possible
honour
on
the
society
of
grigs
chapter
xv
a
pleasant
saturday
at
five
farrington
sent
the
girls
home
in
her
carriage
the
four
who
lived
farthest
were
sent
first
and
this
left
the
two
hart
girls
and
patty
to
wait
for
the
second
trip
they
had
returned
to
the
farrington
house
and
were
waiting
in
the
library
roger
was
there
and
also
two
of
elise
s
younger
sisters
patty
was
glad
to
see
more
of
the
farrington
family
and
chatted
pleasantly
with
the
little
girls
but
before
she
went
away
roger
found
an
opportunity
to
speak
to
her
again
i
say
you
know
he
began
i
don
t
know
just
how
to
express
it
but
i
want
to
thank
you
for
the
way
you
talked
to
me
it
wasn
t
so
much
what
you
said
but
that
brave
plucky
kind
of
talk
does
brace
a
fellow
up
wonderfully
and
i
m
no
end
obliged
to
you
re
more
than
welcome
i
m
sure
said
patty
smiling
but
i
didn
t
say
anything
worth
while
i
wish
i
could
really
help
you
but
if
you
ll
just
look
on
the
bright
side
you
know
you
can
help
yourself
a
whole
you
help
other
poor
little
boys
in
hospitals
said
roger
you
go
to
see
tommy
well
i
can
t
go
to
see
you
said
patty
laughing
but
i
ll
tell
you
what
i
will
do
i
ll
make
a
for
you
or
a
peanut
doll
whichever
you
d
rather
i
think
i
ll
take
the
said
roger
with
the
air
of
one
making
an
important
decision
you
see
i
might
be
tempted
to
eat
up
the
peanut
that
s
so
well
i
ll
promise
to
make
you
a
nice
little
and
send
it
to
you
next
week
and
i
hope
you
ll
get
along
all
right
and
honestly
i
think
you
i
think
so
too
said
roger
cheerfully
and
then
the
carriage
returned
and
patty
went
home
that
evening
she
told
her
father
all
about
the
farringtons
it
was
so
funny
papa
she
said
to
be
visiting
in
one
of
those
grand
millionaire
houses
why
it
s
like
those
that
are
pictured
in
the
magazines
you
know
and
i
thought
that
those
people
were
always
ostentatious
and
and
generally
snippy
to
us
poorer
classes
but
the
farringtons
aren
t
that
way
a
bit
they
re
refined
and
gentle
and
awfully
kind
they
have
some
queer
ways
and
somehow
they
seem
a
little
entirely
happy
you
very
pleasant
and
sweet
to
us
girls
but
aren
t
elise
s
parents
good
to
her
to
give
her
all
that
pleasure
the
casino
i
the
casino
is
truly
a
splendid
thing
said
fairfield
but
do
you
think
it
necessarily
shows
that
and
farrington
are
more
fond
of
their
children
than
other
people
are
patty
thought
a
while
quite
seriously
then
she
said
i
believe
i
see
what
you
mean
you
mean
that
farrington
is
fond
of
his
children
just
as
other
fathers
are
but
that
he
happens
to
have
money
enough
to
give
them
bigger
things
because
i
know
papa
fairfield
that
if
you
had
millions
of
dollars
you
d
be
plenty
fond
enough
of
me
to
give
me
a
dozen
casinos
wouldn
t
you
two
dozen
if
you
wanted
them
puss
and
if
i
could
afford
them
yes
that
s
what
i
mean
patty
and
it
s
the
old
question
of
proportion
from
what
i
know
in
a
general
way
of
farrington
and
from
what
you
tell
me
of
their
home
life
i
believe
they
have
a
good
sense
of
proportion
and
are
consequently
people
who
are
pleasant
to
know
but
my
child
you
must
look
out
for
your
own
sense
of
proportion
remember
elise
is
a
rich
girl
and
lives
in
luxury
but
you
are
not
and
while
we
are
in
fairly
comfortable
circumstances
i
want
you
to
realise
the
difference
and
not
feel
envious
of
her
or
discontented
because
you
can
t
live
as
she
indeed
i
don
t
papa
i
m
not
quite
such
a
goose
as
that
as
you
ought
to
know
by
this
time
but
i
do
like
to
visit
there
and
i
enjoy
the
lovely
house
and
the
beautiful
pictures
and
that
s
all
right
patty
girl
if
you
like
elise
too
but
i
don
t
want
you
to
cultivate
anybody
just
for
the
sake
of
their
beautiful
home
and
pleasant
i
do
like
elise
papa
very
much
she
s
a
peculiar
girl
and
i
don
t
think
i
quite
understand
her
yet
but
there
s
a
good
deal
to
her
and
the
more
i
see
of
her
the
better
i
like
her
she
has
invited
me
to
lunch
there
on
saturday
and
afterwards
go
to
a
matinée
with
her
the
french
governess
will
take
us
and
farrington
told
elise
she
might
ask
me
may
i
go
papa
why
yes
child
i
don
t
see
any
reason
why
you
shouldn
t
i
want
you
to
have
all
the
good
times
that
it
s
right
for
a
little
girl
to
have
what
is
the
matinée
i
forget
the
name
of
it
but
it
s
one
of
those
humpty
dumpty
sort
of
shows
with
fairies
and
wonderful
scenes
elise
says
it
was
brought
over
from
london
and
it
s
something
like
what
they
call
a
christmas
pantomime
over
that
s
all
right
chicken
you
may
go
and
i
hope
you
ll
have
a
beautiful
time
and
then
some
day
you
must
invite
elise
here
to
luncheon
and
i
ll
take
you
both
to
a
oh
papa
that
will
be
lovely
how
good
you
are
to
me
i
haven
t
seen
farrington
yet
but
i
m
sure
he
isn
t
a
quarter
as
handsome
as
you
are
if
he
is
twice
as
he
s
probably
a
hundred
times
as
rich
said
fairfield
laughing
and
twice
as
i
don
t
believe
a
word
of
it
said
patty
smiling
at
her
father
and
nan
wouldn
t
i
don
t
believe
she
would
between
you
two
flatterers
i
run
a
fair
chance
of
being
completely
when
shall
i
see
nan
asked
patty
isn
t
she
coming
to
new
york
this
winter
yes
after
the
holidays
she
and
allen
are
coming
to
town
for
a
month
or
lovely
where
will
they
be
at
the
wilberforce
no
they
will
stay
at
a
hotel

the
very
thing

comic

too
funny
for
anything
and
papa
he

another
good

t

blessed

blessed
little
girl
and

happy
and
contented
disposition
and
you
ll
find
out
in
the
long
run
that
that
is
better
than
wealth
or
high
social
on
saturday
patty
went
to
elise
s
for
luncheon
the
farrington
carriage
came
for
her
and
a
maid
was
sent
to
accompany
her
although
without
a
shade
of
envy
in
her
mind
patty
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
ride
in
the
luxurious
carriage
with
a
smart
and
imposing
coachman
and
footman
and
the
trim
little
french
maid
beside
her
i
m
afraid
she
thought
to
herself
that
i
have
a
love
of
luxury
but
papa
says
if
i
m
not
envious
it
won
t
do
any
harm
and
i
m
sure
i
m
when
they
reached
the
farringtons
elise
took
patty
at
once
to
her
own
room
patty
was
not
surprised
to
find
that
this
was
the
prettiest
bedroom
she
had
ever
seen
and
she
fairly
revelled
in
the
beautiful
furnishings
and
decorations
oh
this
room
is
all
right
said
elise
carelessly
but
if
you
want
to
see
a
really
remarkable
room
just
step
out
as
she
spoke
elise
opened
the
door
out
to
what
patty
supposed
was
a
sort
of
balcony
or
enclosed
veranda
at
the
back
of
the
house
but
it
was
not
exactly
that
it
was
as
elise
expressed
it
a
glass
it
was
an
extension
of
the
house
and
the
sides
and
roof
were
entirely
of
glass
a
clever
arrangement
of
japanese
screens
adjusted
the
light
as
desired
you
see
explained
elise
i
m
a
sort
of
i
never
can
get
sunlight
enough
in
the
city
so
i
planned
this
room
all
myself
and
father
had
it
built
for
me
there
is
an
extension
of
the
house
below
it
and
they
only
had
to
put
up
a
sort
of
frame
or
skeleton
room
and
then
enclose
it
with
glass
so
here
you
see
i
have
plenty
of
light
and
i
just
revel
in
it
i
call
it
my
studio
because
i
paint
a
little
but
i
sit
here
more
to
read
or
to
chum
with
my
friends
or
just
to
loaf
and
do
i
love
sunlight
too
exclaimed
patty
and
i
think
this
room
is
wonderful
i
used
to
have
a
pretty
little
enclosed
balcony
at
my
aunt
s
in
vernondale
but
of
course
it
wasn
t
like
the
furniture
in
elise
s
studio
was
almost
entirely
of
gilded
and
mirrors
added
to
the
general
glittering
effect
on
the
whole
patty
thought
she
preferred
her
balcony
at
aunt
alice
s
but
this
room
was
very
novel
and
interesting
and
far
better
adapted
for
winter
weather
of
course
there
s
no
way
to
heat
it
said
elise
for
i
wasn
t
going
to
have
the
glass
walls
spoiled
with
old
pipes
and
radiators
but
the
sun
usually
warms
it
sufficiently
or
i
can
leave
the
doors
open
from
my
how
do
you
like
the
oliphant
asked
patty
as
the
girls
settled
down
for
an
intimate
chat
oh
i
like
it
all
right
i
think
the
school
is
as
good
as
any
and
miss
oliphant
seems
very
nice
though
really
i
haven
t
seen
much
of
her
i
like
the
girls
fairly
well
but
the
grigs
seem
to
be
the
nicest
ones
of
the
whole
oh
you
think
that
because
you
know
them
better
than
the
others
isn
t
hilda
a
dear
yes
i
suppose
so
but
somehow
i
don
t
get
on
with
her
quite
as
well
as
with
the
others
i
always
seem
to
rub
her
the
wrong
way
though
i
never
mean
that
s
because
you
both
want
to
rule
said
patty
laughing
has
it
never
struck
you
elise
that
you
re
very
fond
of
having
things
your
own
way
yes
returned
elise
tranquilly
i
know
quite
well
what
you
mean
it
s
my
nature
to
boss
yes
that
s
just
it
and
it
s
hilda
s
nature
and
it
s
your
nature
yes
i
think
it
is
but
i
don
t
care
so
much
about
it
as
you
two
girls
and
i
m
more
willing
to
give
you
re
better
s
the
truth
and
that
s
one
reason
why
i
like
you
best
of
all
the
schoolgirls
and
i
hope
you
like
me
do
you
of
course
i
do
or
i
shouldn
t
be
here
i
don
t
believe
you
would
but
there
are
some
girls
and
you
must
excuse
my
saying
this
who
just
like
me
or
pretend
to
like
me
because
i
m
one
of
the
rich
i
know
that
sounds
horrid
but
i
think
you
understand
it
s
so
ridiculous
that
the
mere
accident
of
having
more
money
than
some
other
people
should
make
people
think
us
desirable
i
think
i
understand
what
you
mean
said
patty
smiling
at
elise
s
earnestness
but
don
t
you
bother
about
me
i
like
you
because
i
think
you
re
the
kind
of
a
girl
i
like
and
i
don
t
care
a
speck
more
for
you
because
your
father
s
a
millionaire
but
to
be
truly
honest
aside
from
your
own
charming
self
i
do
like
to
see
all
these
lovely
things
you
have
in
your
home
and
i
like
to
play
in
your
casino
and
i
like
to
ride
in
your
so
do
i
said
elise
i
enjoy
it
all
but
if
it
were
all
taken
away
from
me
i
wouldn
t
mind
so
very
much
do
you
know
i
ve
always
thought
i
should
rather
enjoy
it
if
i
had
to
earn
my
own
well
you
are
a
queer
girl
and
i
hope
you
won
t
be
able
to
realise
your
wish
very
soon
for
if
you
ll
excuse
my
saying
it
i
don
t
believe
you
earn
your
own
i
don
t
know
whether
i
could
or
not
but
it
would
be
so
exciting
to
well
it
s
an
excitement
that
you
ought
to
be
thankful
not
to
have
at
then
the
girls
went
down
to
luncheon
and
after
that
to
the
matinée
the
time
passed
like
a
happy
dream
and
when
patty
was
again
set
down
at
her
own
home
she
felt
more
than
ever
glad
that
she
had
such
delightful
friends
she
spent
the
evening
giving
her
father
and
grandma
a
detailed
account
of
her
experiences
and
succeeded
in
making
them
almost
as
enthusiastic
as
herself
chapter
xvi
a
capable
cook
the
next
saturday
morning
the
grigs
met
at
hilda
s
and
after
the
merry
meeting
was
over
clementine
begged
patty
to
stop
in
at
her
house
for
a
few
moments
on
her
way
home
i
d
ask
you
to
stay
to
luncheon
said
clementine
as
they
went
through
the
hall
but
mamma
is
giving
a
luncheon
party
and
i
can
t
have
anything
to
eat
myself
until
after
her
guests
have
oh
i
must
go
home
anyway
said
patty
grandma
is
expecting
see
how
pretty
the
table
looks
said
clementine
as
the
girls
passed
by
the
open
door
of
the
beautiful
exclaimed
patty
as
she
paused
to
look
at
the
daintily
appointed
table
with
its
shining
glass
and
silver
its
decorations
and
pretty
name
cards
your
mother
knows
just
how
to
arrange
a
table
doesn
t
she
how
many
are
coming
eight
that
is
there
will
be
eight
with
mamma
of
course
i
never
go
to
the
table
when
she
has
formal
company
i
can
have
something
to
eat
in
the
butler
s
pantry
or
i
can
wait
until
the
luncheon
is
over
and
then
go
in
the
yes
the
table
will
look
lovely
after
the
flowers
are
on
and
all
the
last
the
two
girls
went
on
up
to
the
and
were
soon
engrossed
in
lively
chat
about
their
own
affairs
suddenly
morse
appeared
in
the
oh
clementine
she
exclaimed
with
an
air
of
the
greatest
consternation
i
don
t
know
i
am
to
do
cook
has
scalded
her
hands
fearfully
she
upset
a
kettle
of
boiling
water
and
the
burns
were
so
bad
i
had
to
send
her
straight
to
the
hospital
she
s
just
gone
and
it
s
after
twelve
now
and
all
those
people
coming
to
luncheon
at
one
nothing
is
cooked
nothing
is
ready
and
i
m
at
my
wits
can
t
jane
cook
no
she
s
only
a
waitress
and
besides
i
need
her
in
the
i
can
t
think
of
anything
but
for
you
to
run
right
down
to
pacetti
s
and
ask
them
to
send
me
a
capable
cook
at
once
i
d
telephone
but
i
m
afraid
they
d
send
some
inexperienced
person
so
i
think
it
better
for
you
to
go
make
them
understand
the
necessity
for
haste
but
dear
me
they
re
so
slow
anyway
that
i
doubt
if
a
cook
would
reach
here
before
one
and
there
is
so
much
to
be
done
i
never
was
in
such
an
unfortunate
situation
morse
looked
the
picture
of
despair
and
indeed
it
was
not
surprising
that
she
should
but
while
she
had
been
talking
to
clementine
patty
had
been
doing
some
quick
thinking
mrs
morse
she
said
if
you
will
trust
me
i
will
cook
your
luncheon
for
you
i
can
do
it
perfectly
well
and
i
will
engage
to
have
everything
ready
at
one
if
i
can
go
right
to
my
dear
child
you
re
crazy
everything
is
all
prepared
to
be
cooked
but
it
is
by
no
means
a
plain
meal
there
are
quail
to
be
broiled
lobster
newburg
to
be
prepared
salad
dressing
soup
coffee
and
no
end
of
things
to
be
looked
after
besides
a
most
elaborate
dessert
from
the
confectioner
s
which
has
to
be
properly
arranged
so
you
see
though
i
appreciate
your
kind
offer
of
help
it
is
outside
the
patty
s
eyes
danced
as
she
heard
this
list
of
the
fancy
dishes
in
which
her
soul
delighted
please
let
me
do
it
morse
she
begged
i
know
how
to
do
everything
you
ve
mentioned
and
with
clementine
to
help
me
i
ll
send
up
the
dishes
exactly
as
they
should
but
i
don
t
know
a
thing
about
cooking
exclaimed
clementine
in
dismay
i
don
t
want
you
to
help
me
cook
i
ll
do
that
i
just
want
you
to
help
me
beat
eggs
or
chop
parsley
or
things
like
that
you
must
promise
to
obey
my
orders
strictly
and
quickly
then
there
ll
be
no
trouble
of
any
kind
truly
morse
i
can
do
it
and
do
it
patty
s
air
of
assurance
convinced
morse
and
though
it
seemed
absurd
the
poor
lady
was
so
anxious
to
believe
in
this
apparent
miracle
that
she
consented
why
patty
she
said
if
you
really
do
it
it
would
be
a
perfect
godsend
to
me
to
have
indeed
i
can
said
patty
who
was
already
turning
up
the
sleeves
of
her
by
way
of
preparation
just
give
me
a
big
apron
and
wait
one
minute
while
i
telephone
to
grandma
not
to
expect
me
home
to
luncheon
and
then
show
me
the
way
to
the
when
they
reached
the
kitchen
patty
was
delighted
to
see
how
beautifully
everything
was
prepared
for
cooking
the
quail
were
already
on
the
broiler
the
bread
cut
for
toast
the
ingredients
for
the
salad
dressing
measured
the
dishes
were
piled
in
order
and
the
cooking
utensils
laid
ready
to
hand
why
it
will
be
no
trouble
at
all
she
exclaimed
your
cook
must
be
a
genius
to
have
everything
so
systematically
are
you
quite
sure
you
know
how
said
morse
once
more
looking
doubtfully
at
the
uncooked
viands
oh
yes
indeed
exclaimed
patty
blithely
it
s
twice
as
easy
as
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
but
i
must
have
full
sway
and
no
interference
of
any
sort
now
you
run
along
good
lady
and
put
on
your
pretty
gown
and
don
t
give
another
thought
to
your
food
but
please
send
the
waitress
to
me
as
we
must
understand
each
morse
looked
at
patty
with
a
sort
of
awe
as
if
she
had
suddenly
discovered
a
genius
in
one
whom
she
had
hitherto
thought
of
as
a
mere
child
then
she
went
away
to
dress
feeling
that
somehow
things
would
come
out
all
right
patty
was
in
her
element
not
only
because
she
dearly
loved
to
cook
and
thoroughly
understood
the
concoction
of
fancy
dishes
but
more
because
she
was
so
delighted
to
have
an
opportunity
to
help
morse
clementine
s
mother
was
one
of
her
ideal
women
and
patty
admired
her
exceedingly
moreover
she
had
been
very
kind
to
patty
and
the
grateful
girl
was
happy
in
the
thought
of
being
a
real
help
to
her
good
friend
when
jane
came
to
the
kitchen
patty
explained
the
situation
to
her
and
in
a
few
clear
straightforward
orders
made
it
impossible
that
any
mistake
should
occur
between
the
cooking
and
the
serving
patty
unconsciously
assumed
an
air
of
dignity
which
struck
clementine
as
intensely
comical
but
which
impressed
jane
as
the
demeanour
of
a
genius
now
said
patty
when
jane
had
returned
to
the
i
ll
give
you
fair
warning
clementine
that
i
shall
be
pretty
cross
while
i
m
doing
this
cooking
you
know
crossness
is
the
prerogative
of
a
cook
so
don
t
mind
me
but
just
help
all
you
can
by
keeping
quiet
and
doing
as
i
tell
you
i
m
sorry
to
seem
dictatorial
and
horrid
but
really
it
s
the
only
way
to
make
your
mother
s
luncheon
a
and
then
patty
became
entirely
absorbed
in
her
work
she
took
a
rapid
survey
of
everything
summarized
what
she
had
to
do
looked
up
some
forgotten
points
in
a
recipe
book
and
moved
around
so
deftly
and
capably
that
clementine
just
sat
and
stared
at
her
she
put
the
on
to
heat
also
a
great
kettle
of
lard
she
moulded
the
croquettes
and
put
the
french
peas
on
the
stove
now
she
said
to
clementine
have
you
an
ice
crusher
i
don
t
know
i
m
sure
said
clementine
helplessly
what
is
it
like
patty
laughed
i
ll
find
it
she
said
and
after
a
short
search
she
did
then
she
set
clementine
to
crushing
ice
for
the
oysters
a
task
which
that
young
woman
accomplished
successfully
and
with
great
pride
in
her
own
achievement
all
right
said
patty
with
an
abstracted
air
now
toast
these
rounds
of
bread
while
you
can
have
the
fire
and
then
put
them
in
the
oven
to
keep
this
performance
was
not
so
successful
for
when
clementine
showed
her
plate
of
toast
it
was
a
collection
of
burnt
crisps
and
underdone
spongy
bread
for
goodness
sake
exclaimed
patty
can
t
you
toast
better
than
that
they
won
t
do
at
all
cut
some
more
bread
and
hurry
up
about
it
you
said
you
d
be
cross
murmured
clementine
as
she
cut
more
bread
but
you
didn
t
say
you
d
snap
my
head
off
like
a
raging
both
girls
laughed
but
patty
toasted
the
bread
herself
as
she
wasn
t
willing
to
take
any
more
chances
in
that
direction
but
the
real
excitement
began
when
the
luncheon
hour
actually
arrived
though
not
exactly
nervous
patty
s
mind
was
strung
to
a
certain
tension
which
can
only
be
appreciated
by
those
who
know
the
sensations
of
an
cook
preparing
a
formal
meal
precisely
at
one
patty
placed
on
the
eight
plates
of
the
appearance
of
which
caused
clementine
to
clasp
her
hands
in
speechless
admiration
each
golden
hemisphere
nestled
in
a
bed
of
clear
cracked
ice
and
was
marvellously
decorated
with
crimson
cherries
and
glossy
green
orange
leaves
after
this
the
various
courses
followed
one
another
in
what
seemed
to
the
girls
maddeningly
rapid
succession
clementine
soon
discovered
that
she
could
do
only
the
simplest
things
but
her
quick
wit
enabled
her
to
help
in
other
ways
by
getting
the
dishes
ready
and
handing
patty
such
things
as
she
wanted
it
was
a
thrilling
hour
but
patty
s
spirits
rose
as
one
course
after
another
turned
out
the
very
acme
of
perfection
the
croquettes
were
the
loveliest
golden
brown
the
quail
broiled
to
a
turn
the
lobster
hot
in
its
paper
cases
and
the
salad
a
dream
of
cold
crisp
beauty
at
last
they
reached
the
dessert
this
was
a
complicated
affair
with
various
adjuncts
in
the
way
of
sauces
and
whipped
cream
the
main
part
was
frozen
and
was
packed
in
a
large
tub
of
ice
and
salt
clementine
volunteered
to
get
this
out
and
as
patty
was
busy
she
let
her
do
it
but
alas
the
inexperienced
girl
opened
the
before
taking
it
from
the
freezer
the
salt
water
rushed
in
and
in
a
moment
the
delicious
confection
was
totally
uneatable
patty
grasped
the
situation
clementine
fully
expected
she
would
be
cross
now
if
ever
but
as
patty
afterward
explained
the
occasion
was
too
critical
for
that
the
dessert
is
spoiled
she
said
in
an
whisper
we
must
make
another
what
out
of
asked
clementine
in
the
same
hushed
tone
i
don
t
know
what
have
you
in
the
house
bread
exclaimed
clementine
with
a
sudden
inspiration
from
the
loaf
on
the
table
ridiculous
there
must
be
something
else
have
you
any
stale
cake
i
don
t
know
yes
wait
a
minute
there
s
plenty
of
but
it
s
locked
up
in
one
of
the
pantry
where
s
the
key
quick
why
i
don
t
know
i
suppose
it
s
in
mamma
s
run
and
get
it
and
patty
fairly
glared
at
clementine
fly
and
don
t
be
gone
more
than
half
a
minute
poor
clementine
bewildered
by
the
awful
emergency
which
she
had
herself
brought
about
flew
for
the
key
and
luckily
found
it
at
once
she
returned
with
a
huge
and
in
a
second
patty
s
anxious
face
broke
into
smiles
the
country
is
safe
she
cried
dancing
round
the
kitchen
fate
can
not
harm
us
now
nor
salt
water
i
don
t
believe
mamma
will
like
just
for
dessert
said
clementine
dubiously
huh
said
patty
tossing
her
head
in
the
air
watch
the
magician
but
first
have
you
any
rather
tall
you
know
with
slender
yes
said
clementine
already
disappearing
in
quest
of
them
when
she
returned
patty
had
eight
discs
of
cake
which
she
had
cut
from
slices
and
placing
one
in
each
glass
she
put
on
each
a
spoonful
of
the
sauce
that
had
been
intended
for
the
unfortunate
frozen
pudding
this
she
topped
with
a
shapely
mound
of
whipped
cream
on
which
she
daintily
placed
candied
cherries
the
desserts
were
ready
in
ample
time
and
after
sending
up
the
coffee
patty
drew
a
long
sigh
of
relief
then
the
two
hungry
girls
sat
down
in
the
kitchen
to
eat
their
own
luncheon
for
which
there
was
an
ample
supply
of
the
good
things
left
and
to
talk
over
the
exciting
experience
you
re
a
wonder
patty
said
clementine
i
had
no
idea
you
could
do
things
like
oh
i
ve
been
a
housekeeper
in
my
day
you
know
said
patty
and
it
was
only
after
lots
of
failures
that
i
learned
to
do
those
things
later
on
morse
undertook
to
express
her
gratitude
to
the
little
girl
who
had
rescued
her
from
so
much
trouble
and
mortification
but
the
good
lady
s
delight
was
too
great
for
words
and
she
promised
that
the
time
would
yet
come
when
she
would
reward
patty
in
some
appropriate
way
i
don
t
want
any
reward
said
patty
looking
lovingly
at
her
friend
except
to
know
that
i
helped
you
when
nobody
else
you
certainly
did
that
said
morse
chapter
xvii
lorraine
s
endeavour
patty
s
sunny
disposition
and
invariable
good
humour
exerted
a
beneficial
influence
on
lorraine
though
the
effects
were
slow
and
gradual
but
the
girl
herself
was
trying
to
be
more
optimistic
in
her
general
attitude
toward
life
and
to
a
degree
she
was
succeeding
but
one
afternoon
she
came
up
to
patty
s
apartment
to
sit
with
her
for
a
while
and
the
expression
of
her
face
was
quite
as
dark
and
gloomy
as
of
yore
patty
noticed
this
at
once
but
did
not
remark
it
instead
she
began
chatting
in
a
merry
vein
hoping
by
this
means
to
cheer
up
her
dismal
caller
but
it
was
of
no
avail
for
lorraine
evidently
had
a
trouble
of
some
sort
on
her
mind
at
last
she
exclaimed
in
a
stormy
way
i
just
elise
farrington
oho
thought
patty
to
herself
so
that
s
the
trouble
is
it
but
aloud
she
only
said
why
do
you
hate
her
she
doesn
t
hate
yes
she
does
she
just
snubs
me
right
and
left
and
she
doesn
t
invite
me
to
her
casino
or
now
look
here
lorraine
you
are
unjust
and
unfair
elise
doesn
t
snub
you
or
if
she
does
it
s
because
you
don
t
give
her
a
chance
to
be
nice
to
you
you
re
my
friend
but
elise
is
my
friend
too
and
i
want
fair
play
all
around
i
ve
seen
you
with
elise
farrington
and
you
snub
her
worse
than
she
does
you
and
i
don
t
wonder
she
doesn
t
invite
you
to
see
her
patty
didn
t
often
scold
lorraine
as
hard
as
this
but
her
sense
of
justice
was
aroused
and
she
determined
to
give
it
full
play
for
once
lorraine
began
to
cry
but
patty
knew
they
were
not
tears
of
repentance
so
she
went
on
it
s
perfectly
silly
lorraine
the
way
you
act
here
you
might
just
as
well
belong
to
the
grigs
and
have
lots
of
good
times
but
just
because
you
to
consider
yourself
snubbed
at
every
tack
and
turn
when
nobody
means
anything
of
the
sort
at
all
of
course
you
can
t
belong
to
a
club
whose
only
object
is
to
be
merry
and
i
don
t
want
to
belong
to
your
old
grigs
i
think
they
re
silly
and
i
hate
em
all
you
want
to
belong
and
you
think
they
re
silly
now
look
here
lorraine
i
m
just
about
at
the
end
of
my
patience
i
ve
done
everything
i
could
for
you
to
make
you
more
like
the
other
girls
and
though
you
re
nicer
in
some
ways
than
you
used
to
be
yet
you
re
so
foolishly
sensitive
that
you
make
yourself
a
lot
of
trouble
that
i
can
t
help
i
don
t
mind
telling
you
now
that
we
re
on
the
subject
that
the
girls
are
all
ready
to
take
you
in
as
a
member
of
the
grigs
if
you
ll
be
nice
and
pleasant
but
we
don
t
want
any
disagreeable
members
or
any
members
who
insist
on
thinking
themselves
snubbed
when
nobody
had
any
such
lorraine
stopped
crying
and
looked
at
patty
with
a
peculiar
expression
do
you
really
mean
she
said
that
you
d
take
me
into
the
grigs
if
i
were
not
so
well
since
you
choose
to
put
it
that
way
that
s
just
about
what
i
do
mean
said
patty
politely
ignoring
the
fact
that
lorraine
had
declared
she
didn
t
want
to
be
a
grig
well
then
i
be
and
stop
being
so
hateful
to
the
girls
just
make
me
a
grig
and
i
ll
show
no
lorraine
that
won
t
do
you
ve
got
to
prove
yourself
first
now
i
ll
tell
you
be
real
nice
to
elise
and
make
her
like
you
or
rather
her
like
you
and
then
there
ll
be
no
trouble
about
getting
you
into
the
all
right
said
lorraine
hopefully
but
what
can
i
do
elise
won
t
speak
to
me
oh
pshaw
yes
she
will
i
ll
guarantee
that
she
ll
meet
you
now
here
s
a
plan
you
must
do
something
like
this
get
your
mother
to
let
you
invite
elise
to
come
to
see
you
some
afternoon
and
then
invite
the
harts
and
me
too
and
have
a
real
jolly
afternoon
they
ll
all
come
and
then
if
you
re
nice
and
pleasant
as
you
know
perfectly
well
how
to
be
the
girls
can
t
help
liking
you
oh
lorraine
you
re
a
goose
it
s
a
great
deal
easier
to
go
through
the
world
happy
and
smiling
than
to
mope
along
glum
and
it
is
for
you
patty
because
you
re
born
happy
and
you
can
t
help
staying
so
but
i
m
well
then
yourself
as
soon
as
you
can
it
s
s
what
it
s
worse
than
s
not
to
be
happy
and
gay
i
ve
fooled
with
you
long
enough
and
now
i
m
going
to
you
behave
yourself
laugh
now
laugh
at
once
patty
s
gaiety
was
infectious
and
lorraine
laughed
because
she
couldn
t
help
it
then
they
fell
to
making
plans
for
the
little
afternoon
party
and
lorraine
s
spirits
rose
until
there
was
nothing
to
choose
between
the
merriment
of
the
two
girls
and
i
ll
tell
you
what
said
patty
we
re
making
a
for
roger
farrington
he
s
in
the
hospital
you
know
and
if
you
will
have
some
funny
pictures
or
stories
ready
to
put
in
it
you
needn
t
worry
any
further
about
elise
s
liking
you
she
s
the
most
grateful
girl
for
little
things
i
ever
oh
i
can
do
that
said
lorraine
i
d
love
before
lorraine
invited
the
girls
to
visit
her
patty
had
talked
with
each
one
and
made
them
promise
to
accept
the
invitation
and
do
all
that
they
could
to
help
along
the
good
cause
which
as
she
explained
was
a
truly
griggish
one
so
the
four
girls
went
to
lorraine
s
one
afternoon
all
in
a
merry
mood
the
little
party
was
a
great
success
for
lorraine
at
her
best
was
a
charming
hostess
and
her
mother
was
very
kind
and
hospitable
each
girl
brought
some
contribution
for
roger
s
and
patty
was
secretly
delighted
when
she
found
that
lorraine
s
donation
was
quite
the
jolliest
of
all
lorraine
was
clever
with
her
pencil
and
with
her
needle
and
she
had
designed
some
funny
little
football
players
by
cutting
pictures
of
football
celebrities
from
the
papers
these
she
had
dressed
up
in
bits
of
real
material
had
made
the
footballs
of
real
leather
and
made
tiny
silk
flags
in
college
colours
elise
was
delighted
beyond
all
measure
at
the
clever
little
figures
and
when
lorraine
a
little
bashfully
offered
a
poem
she
had
written
to
go
with
them
the
girls
all
declared
she
was
a
genius
it
was
a
humorous
poem
with
a
football
refrain
and
elise
said
that
she
was
sure
roger
would
commit
it
to
memory
and
quote
it
on
every
possible
occasion
happily
the
girls
went
to
work
cutting
and
pasting
drawing
and
sketching
writing
and
sewing
on
the
various
pages
until
the
became
a
marvellous
work
of
art
patty
asked
them
to
leave
one
or
two
pages
blank
for
hepworth
s
funny
sketches
and
promised
too
that
he
would
decorate
the
cover
a
few
days
later
hepworth
spent
the
evening
with
the
fairfields
and
willingly
agreed
to
add
his
share
to
the
book
he
filled
a
couple
of
pages
with
drawings
funny
enough
to
make
a
whole
hospital
laugh
and
then
adorned
the
cover
with
a
conventional
design
of
football
players
and
grigs
surrounding
a
patient
in
a
hospital
cot
while
hepworth
was
sketching
patty
related
with
glee
how
much
lorraine
had
helped
with
the
book
and
how
really
amiable
and
pleasant
the
girl
had
begun
to
be
as
hepworth
was
a
frequent
visitor
at
the
fairfields
he
knew
a
good
deal
about
lorraine
and
was
much
interested
if
lorraine
is
really
trying
to
live
the
merry
life
said
fairfield
she
ought
to
be
aided
and
encouraged
in
every
possible
way
now

you

i
ll
do
patty

saturday

grandma
said
fairfield
now
for
a
lady

your
dignified
appearance
an
oratorio

lecture

country
circus
the
circus

square
garden

hepworth

said
grandma
eagerly
for
i
saw
them
on
the
they
all
laughed
at
this
and
declared
it
was
more
fun
to
take
grandma
to
the
circus
than
to
take
a
child
both
lorraine
and
kenneth
accepted
the
invitation
with
pleasure
and
kenneth
volunteered
to
make
lorraine
his
especial
charge
and
if
the
fun
of
the
circus
flagged
to
amuse
her
with
some
fun
of
his
own
saturday
was
a
beautiful
bright
day
and
fairfield
promised
to
come
home
to
luncheon
in
order
that
they
might
all
start
together
in
ample
time
for
the
performance
about
eleven
o
clock
a
card
was
brought
up
to
patty
by
the
hall
boy
miss
rachel
daggett
she
read
in
dismayed
tones
grandma
she
has
come
to
stay
a
few
days
she
said
she
would
you
know
the
last
time
we
were
in
vernondale
and
now
she
s
here
oh
i
wish
she
had
chosen
any
other
day
she
wouldn
t
let
me
set
the
time
but
said
she
would
come
whenever
the
mood
struck
well
my
dear
you
can
t
help
it
send
word
for
her
to
come
up
and
make
the

of
but
grandma

d
just
as
lief
stay

as
to

time

and
patty
and
grandma

been
their
neighbour
in
vernondale
and
patty
was
really
fond
of
the
queer
old
lady
but
she
only
wished
she
had
chosen
some
other
day
to
visit
them
or
had
at
least
let
them
know
beforehand
i
told
you
i
d
come
when
the
mood
took
me
said
miss
daggett
as
she
removed
her
antiquated
bonnet
all
of
miss
daggett
s
apparel
was
what
patty
called
ancient
and
honourable
her
gown
and
cloak
were
of
the
richest
material
but
made
in
fashions
of
many
years
ago
although
a
woman
of
wealth
miss
daggett
was
subject
to
whims
one
of
which
was
to
wear
out
the
dresses
she
had
before
buying
any
new
ones
as
this
whim
had
followed
another
whim
of
lavish
extravagance
the
dresses
in
question
were
of
rich
velvets
and
brocades
which
did
not
wear
out
rapidly
the
result
was
that
miss
daggett
went
about
looking
as
if
she
had
stepped
out
of
an
old
picture
patty
was
quite
accustomed
to
her
garb
but
suddenly
realised
that
in
the
hotel
it
would
be
rather
conspicuous
but
this
thought
didn
t
bother
her
much
for
she
knew
it
was
something
she
couldn
t
help
and
miss
daggett
had
the
dignified
air
of
a
thorough
gentlewoman
notwithstanding
her
erratic
costume
i
ve
come
to
stay
three
days
she
announced
in
the
abrupt
way
peculiar
to
her
i
shall
go
home
tuesday
morning
at
eleven
o
clock
let
me
look
at
you
patty
why
i
declare
you
look
just
as
you
always
did
i
was
afraid
i
d
find
you
tricked
out
in
all
sorts
of
and
disporting
yourself
like
a
young
oh
no
i
m
still
a
little
girl
miss
daggett
said
patty
and
i
m
just
as
fond
of
fun
and
frolic
as
chapter
xviii
the
circus
party
patty
made
that
last
remark
by
way
of
introducing
the
subject
of
the
circus
for
her
only
hope
was
that
by
some
miraculous
whim
miss
daggett
would
consent
to
go
with
them
their
party
numbered
only
six
and
patty
knew
that
the
box
would
hold
eight
so
there
was
room
enough
if
miss
daggett
would
go
but
as
patty
looked
at
her
guest
s
stern
angular
face
she
didn
t
see
anything
that
led
her
to
feel
very
hopeful
we
had
expected
miss
daggett
she
said
to
go
to
the
circus
this
afternoon
would
you
care
to
go
with
us
to
the
circus
for
the
land
s
sake
no
i
m
surprised
that
you
would
think
of
going
or
that
your
father
would
let
you
go
the
circus
indeed
why
miss
daggett
said
patty
laughing
in
spite
of
her
disappointment
at
miss
daggett
s
shocked
expression
papa
s
going
to
take
us
and
grandma
is
going
is
we
of
course
if
you
don
t
care
to
care
to
go
of
course
i
don
t
care
to
go
all
their
elephants
and
wild
tigers
couldn
t
drag
me
there
and
of
course
i
expect
you
to
stay
at
home
with
me
you
can
go
to
the
circus
any
time
you
choose
if
you
choose
though
i
think
it
a
shocking
thing
to
do
but
rachel
daggett
doesn
t
visit
in
the
city
very
often
and
when
she
does
she
expects
to
have
proper
respect
paid
to
patty
s
spirits
sank
she
had
hoped
that
even
if
miss
daggett
wouldn
t
go
herself
she
would
insist
that
the
rest
of
the
party
should
keep
their
engagement
we
had
invited
a
few
other
friends
to
go
she
said
feeling
that
miss
daggett
s
attitude
justified
her
in
this
further
statement
you
did
hey
well
i
suppose
you
can
telephone
to
them
that
you
re
not
going
of
course
if
i
m
an
unwelcome
oh
no
miss
daggett
not
that
of
course
you
re
not
well
then
act
as
if
you
were
glad
to
see
me
and
don
t
be
everlastingly
whining
because
you
can
t
go
to
your
old
although
rudely
put
patty
knew
in
her
own
heart
the
principle
of
miss
daggett
s
speech
was
that
of
true
hospitality
and
she
decided
to
act
upon
it
moreover
she
felt
sure
that
when
her
father
came
home
he
would
fix
matters
somehow
how
she
didn
t
know
but
she
knew
it
would
be
all
right
when
fairfield
arrived
he
greeted
the
unexpected
guest
in
his
own
cordial
pleasant
way
you
re
just
in
time
he
said
grasping
the
situation
at
once
we
re
all
going
to
the
circus
this
afternoon
and
we
ll
be
delighted
to
have
you
accompany
us
we
have
two
extra
seats
so
there
s
plenty
of
your
daughter
has
already
given
me
the
same
invitation
said
miss
daggett
and
as
i
said
to
her
i
repeat
to
you
nothing
would
induce
me
to
go
to
a
circus
i
think
it
entirely
undignified
and
improper
and
i
am
surprised
that
you
should
suggest
such
a
oh
come
now
miss
daggett
you
can
t
mean
that
circuses
are
all
right
especially
the
one
in
madison
square
garden
why
they
have
the
finest
acrobats
and
trapeze
performers
in
the
world
and
a
score
of
trained
elephants
then
there
is
the
lovely
lady
who
whizzes
through
space
in
an
automobile
and
flies
around
a
great
circular
track
upside
what
exclaimed
miss
daggett
interested
in
spite
of
herself
yes
and
two
men
who
ride
down
hill
on
bicycles
and
at
the
end
jump
off
into
the
air
still
riding
and
jump
on
again
passing
each
other
as
they
i
d
like
to
see
that
said
miss
daggett
thrilled
by
fairfield
s
description
if
it
was
in
a
private
house
but
i
wouldn
t
go
to
the
circus
to
see
it
have
you
never
been
to
a
circus
inquired
fairfield
that
s
neither
here
nor
there
said
miss
daggett
drawing
herself
up
stiffly
and
leaving
the
question
unanswered
well
i
m
sorry
you
won
t
go
said
fairfield
urbanely
for
in
that
case
the
party
must
be
given
up
and
your
nephew
kenneth
will
be
so
this
was
diplomacy
on
fairfield
s
part
for
he
well
knew
how
miss
daggett
idolised
young
harper
and
he
hoped
as
a
last
resort
that
this
argument
might
move
her
kenneth
almost
shrieked
the
old
lady
is
going
didn
t
tell
me
was
going
and
she
glared
reprovingly
at
patty
i
told
you
we
had
invited
some
friends
said
patty
and
he
is
among
kenneth
going
again
exclaimed
miss
daggett
why
then
i
ll
go
all
their
elephants
and
wild
tigers
couldn
t
keep
me
at
home
if
kenneth
is
going
come
let
us
have
luncheon
so
we
can
all
be
ready
in
time
and
not
keep
kenneth
waiting
dear
boy
when
will
he
be
here
he
s
coming
at
quarter
of
two
said
patty
and
then
we
re
all
going
down
together
hepworth
is
going
and
my
friend
lorraine
but
miss
daggett
seemed
to
care
little
who
the
other
guests
were
since
her
nephew
was
to
be
of
the
party
patty
was
quite
accustomed
to
the
old
lady
s
eccentricities
and
moreover
she
was
so
delighted
that
the
circus
party
was
safe
after
all
that
she
humoured
miss
daggett
in
every
possible
way
she
talked
to
her
about
kenneth
and
told
her
of
the
lad
s
good
progress
in
college
and
adroitly
referred
to
the
fact
that
they
had
all
thought
his
steady
application
to
study
deserved
a
reward
in
the
diversions
of
the
circus
miss
daggett
quite
agreed
to
this
and
now
that
the
fact
of
their
going
was
established
she
admitted
that
she
herself
was
anxious
to
see
the
wonders
of
which
fairfield
had
spoken
during
patty
was
summoned
to
the
telephone
to
her
surprise
the
speaker
proved
to
be
none
other
than
roger
farrington
he
said
he
had
been
discharged
from
the
hospital
the
night
before
and
was
again
at
home
although
his
arm
was
still
in
a
sling
he
wanted
to
know
if
he
might
come
down
that
afternoon
and
thank
patty
in
person
for
the
and
for
the
merry
messages
she
had
sent
to
him
by
elise
patty
did
some
quick
thinking
then
she
said
why
you
see
roger
we
re
all
going
to
the
circus
this
afternoon
but
we
have
an
extra
seat
and
if
you
ll
go
with
us
we
ll
be
awfully
glad
to
have
go
exclaimed
roger
i
should
rather
say
i
would
well
if
you
go
said
patty
imbued
with
a
sudden
spirit
of
mischief
you
must
consider
yourself
the
special
escort
of
a
friend
who
is
visiting
me
her
name
is
miss
daggett
and
i
want
her
to
have
a
real
good
trust
me
said
roger
i
ll
give
her
the
time
of
her
life
may
i
call
for
her
are
we
all
to
go
together
yes
said
patty
papa
has
engaged
an
omnibus
and
we
re
going
to
leave
here
at
quarter
before
two
be
sure
to
be
on
oh
i
ll
be
there
give
my
regards
to
miss
daggett
and
expect
me
patty
said
and
then
returned
to
the
table
where
she
told
them
all
what
she
had
done
fairfield
expressed
pleasure
at
having
another
in
their
party
and
said
that
roger
certainly
ought
to
have
some
fun
after
his
weary
stay
in
the
hospital
and
i
asked
him
to
be
your
especial
escort
miss
daggett
said
patty
a
little
uncertain
as
to
how
the
lady
would
take
this
announcement
now
that
s
downright
nice
of
you
said
miss
daggett
beaming
with
pleasure
in
a
most
unexpected
way
but
all
her
ways
were
unexpected
and
patty
wondered
what
roger
would
think
of
her
friend
when
kenneth
harper
came
he
was
surprised
to
find
his
aunt
there
and
still
more
surprised
to
learn
that
she
was
going
with
them
to
the
circus
miss
daggett
was
delighted
to
see
him
and
kenneth
was
also
glad
to
see
her
for
between
this
aunt
and
nephew
there
existed
a
great
deal
of
affection
and
miss
daggett
was
always
less
blunt
and
a
little
more
docile
when
kenneth
was
around
shortly
before
the
time
appointed
roger
appeared
owing
to
the
fact
that
his
arm
was
in
a
sling
it
was
with
some
difficulty
that
he
carried
two
parcels
and
managed
his
hat
you
come
like
the
greeks
bearing
gifts
said
kenneth
as
he
hastened
to
relieve
roger
of
his
burdens
those
are
for
miss
daggett
said
roger
the
lady
i
am
to
escort
to
the
kenneth
tried
not
to
show
his
amazement
and
patty
cast
a
roguish
glance
at
roger
as
she
presented
him
to
miss
daggett
roger
confessed
afterwards
that
at
that
moment
anyone
could
easily
have
knocked
him
down
with
a
feather
for
without
thinking
much
about
it
he
had
assumed
that
patty
s
friend
was
a
girl
of
her
own
age
and
he
had
gallantly
brought
her
some
candy
and
some
violets
but
miss
daggett
herself
proved
quite
equal
to
the
situation
without
a
trace
of
or
embarrassment
she
accepted
the
parcels
from
roger
in
the
most
gracious
way
and
began
to
untie
them
with
all
the
ingenuous
delight
of
a
young
girl
let
me
help
you
said
fairfield
as
he
cut
the
strings
of
the
boxes
the
violets
were
a
huge
bunch
from
the
shop
of
a
fashionable
florist
and
the
box
of
confections
were
of
the
very
best
procurable
miss
daggett
was
so
frankly
delighted
that
roger
too
rose
to
his
part
and
declared
that
she
must
wear
the
violets
that
afternoon
although
their
appearance
on
the
rich
mantilla
was
decidedly
incongruous
yet
miss
daggett
s
dignity
was
such
that
it
quite
saved
the
effect
from
being
ridiculous
roger
immediately
took
a
fancy
to
the
queer
old
lady
and
determined
to
give
patty
a
little
mild
teasing
by
devoting
himself
to
her
friend
all
the
afternoon
but
patty
wasn
t
teased
a
bit
she
was
greatly
only
less
so
than
miss
daggett
herself
kenneth
had
promised
to
make
lorraine
his
especial
care
and
as
fairfield
had
grandma
elliott
in
his
charge
hepworth
fell
to
patty
s
share
for
the
first
time
patty
realised
what
an
entertaining
man
the
artist
could
be
that
afternoon
he
seemed
as
merry
as
a
boy
and
told
droll
tales
or
made
facetious
comments
on
the
performance
until
patty
was
convulsed
with
laughter
no
less
gay
were
roger
farrington
and
his
companion
being
innately
courteous
and
gentlemanly
he
deemed
it
his
duty
to
entertain
miss
daggett
to
the
very
best
of
his
ability
and
spurred
on
by
the
joke
of
the
whole
affair
he
exerted
himself
especially
to
be
amusing
amid
so
many
novel
experiences
miss
daggett
seemed
to
forget
her
usual
carping
style
of
conversation
and
grew
amiable
and
even
gay
kenneth
too
was
doing
his
part
well
he
had
promised
to
keep
lorraine
in
a
mood
and
he
had
no
trouble
in
doing
so
for
the
girl
met
him
having
herself
determined
that
she
would
follow
patty
s
advice
grandma
was
in
her
element
and
fairfield
was
elated
that
his
little
party
had
turned
out
so
successful
do
you
know
said
hepworth
that
you
are
a
veritable
dispenser
of
happiness
what
do
you
mean
asked
patty
with
her
frank
smile
why
i
mean
that
you
re
not
only
happy
yourself
but
you
give
happiness
to
all
who
are
near
you
consciously
i
mean
you
purposely
arranged
that
lorraine
should
have
a
good
time
and
here
his
eyes
twinkled
you
made
a
somewhat
similar
plan
for
miss
daggett
you
asked
both
those
boys
from
a
real
desire
to
give
them
pleasure
elliott
is
enjoying
every
moment
of
her
good
time
m
happy
it
s
nice
of
you
to
be
so
complimentary
said
patty
but
it
isn
t
fair
for
me
to
take
it
all
to
myself
it
s
papa
s
party
and
you
d
think
me
anything
but
a
general
benefactor
if
you
knew
how
cross
i
was
when
miss
daggett
came
in
unexpectedly
this
and
aside
from
your
intentional
dispensing
of
happiness
went
on
hepworth
ignoring
her
confession
of
your
unconscious
influence
is
that
of
pure
joy
you
radiate
happiness
and
no
one
can
be
near
you
without
feeling
its
influence
i
did
not
intend
patty
to
say
this
quite
so
baldly
but
it
is
not
meant
as
idle
compliment
or
flattery
only
as
an
honest
recognition
of
your
patty
accepted
what
hepworth
said
quite
simply
and
looked
at
him
with
clear
unembarrassed
eyes
thank
you
hepworth
she
said
i
know
you
would
not
say
those
things
unless
you
meant
them
i
m
truly
glad
that
you
think
my
influence
be
it
ever
so
small
is
toward
happiness
for
i
am
always
happy
somehow
i
can
t
help
it
and
i
want
the
whole
world
to
be
so
it
is
that
dear
wish
in
your
heart
that
makes
you
what
you
are
said
hepworth
and
then
with
what
seemed
to
be
a
sudden
effort
he
stopped
their
serious
conversation
and
exclaimed
you
look
at
that
clown
isn
t
he
quite
the
funniest
one
you
ever
saw
patty
laughed
at
the
ridiculous
fellow
and
then
the
wonders
of
the
aerial
bicyclists
and
the
even
more
marvellous
claimed
their
attention
but
long
after
she
had
forgotten
the
amusing
scenes
of
the
circus
patty
remembered
what
hepworth
had
said
chapter
xix
themes
on
friday
afternoons
the
girls
of
the
oliphant
school
were
required
to
read
original
papers
which
they
had
written
through
the
week
and
which
were
technically
known
as
these
themes
were
patty
s
special
delight
her
more
prosaic
lessons
she
learned
from
a
sense
of
duty
and
also
because
of
her
ambition
to
achieve
the
prize
which
was
to
be
given
at
christmas
to
the
pupil
with
the
best
general
average
of
marks
patty
knew
she
stood
high
on
the
list
but
clementine
adelaide
hilda
and
even
lorraine
were
also
far
above
most
of
the
other
pupils
the
rivalry
was
a
and
generous
one
elise
stood
no
chance
for
the
prize
as
she
had
entered
school
a
fortnight
later
than
the
others
her
sympathies
were
entirely
with
patty
and
she
strongly
hoped
that
she
would
win
the
prize
the
markings
of
the
themes
counted
for
a
great
deal
and
the
uniform
excellence
of
patty
s
essays
kept
her
average
up
in
spite
of
her
occasional
low
marks
in
mathematics
a
study
which
she
detested
it
was
no
trouble
for
patty
to
write
imaginative
compositions
her
fertile
fancy
and
her
sense
of
humour
provided
ample
material
and
her
natural
gift
of
expression
made
it
easy
for
her
to
write
excellent
themes
one
wednesday
afternoon
in
november
she
sat
down
to
write
her
paper
for
friday
give
me
a
subject
grandma
she
said
gaily
i
want
to
get
my
theme
done
in
a
jiffy
grandma
elliott
looked
at
the
pretty
girl
who
sat
at
her
desk
with
her
pen
held
above
her
paper
patty
s
sunshiny
face
in
its
frame
of
curling
gold
hair
was
an
ideal
vision
of
youth
and
happiness
why
don
t
you
write
on
the
spirit
of
happiness
said
grandma
and
then
you
can
put
yourself
right
into
your
i
ll
do
it
cried
patty
i
happy
and
i
might
as
well
tell
it
to
the
world
at
she
dashed
into
her
subject
and
scribbled
rapidly
for
some
time
there
she
said
as
she
finished
the
last
page
i
do
believe
grandma
that
s
the
best
theme
i
ve
written
and
if
you
want
to
read
it
you
may
i
m
much
obliged
to
you
for
suggesting
the
grandma
read
the
merry
little
composition
and
quite
agreed
that
it
was
among
the
best
of
patty
s
efforts
at
literature
now
that
s
off
my
mind
for
this
week
she
said
i
do
like
to
get
it
done
and
then
i
can
frisk
about
with
a
clear
conscience
now
i
m
going
to
run
up
to
adelaide
s
for
a
minute
and
see
what
she
s
patty
ran
upstairs
to
the
next
floor
of
the
wilberforce
and
rang
the
bell
of
the
harts
apartment
she
found
adelaide
also
busy
at
work
on
her
theme
oh
then
i
won
t
disturb
you
said
patty
i
ll
go
away
until
you
get
the
old
thing
done
and
then
you
come
down
and
see
i
ll
never
get
it
done
said
adelaide
disconsolately
i
can
t
dash
things
off
in
a
minute
like
you
do
i
have
to
grub
over
them
and
then
they
re
no
good
i
wish
you
d
stay
and
help
all
right
i
will
i
won
t
help
you
enough
to
make
it
wrong
you
know
suppose
i
just
give
you
a
subject
and
a
sort
of
an
outline
of
the
points
and
then
you
write
it
all
do
cried
adelaide
eagerly
what
a
comfort
you
are
patty
easily
patty
detailed
the
foundation
of
a
theme
and
then
while
adelaide
was
writing
she
left
her
to
herself
and
went
in
search
of
the
rest
of
the
family
she
made
a
new
bonnet
for
jeannette
s
doll
and
listened
to
editha
s
new
song
then
she
helped
hart
arrange
some
flowers
which
had
just
arrived
and
by
that
time
adelaide
s
work
was
finished
and
the
two
girls
went
off
by
themselves
for
a
cosey
chat
what
do
you
think
i
heard
began
adelaide
flossy
fisher
told
me
this
afternoon
when
we
were
in
the
getting
our
wraps
and
i
couldn
t
tell
you
on
the
way
home
from
school
because
lorraine
was
with
us
but
it
s
the
most
surprising
thing
i
ever
well
what
is
it
don
t
keep
me
in
suspense
any
why
it
s
just
this
flossy
fisher
overheard
miss
oliphant
oh
if
flossy
was
eavesdropping
i
don
t
want
to
hear
what
she
no
she
wasn
t
eavesdropping
honest
she
wasn
t
patty
but
she
was
just
passing
through
the
hall
and
she
couldn
t
help
hearing
miss
oliphant
say
it
to
miss
fenton
miss
oliphant
had
just
come
out
of
her
private
study
where
she
had
been
making
up
the
averages
and
she
said
to
miss
fenton
that
you
and
lorraine
were
exactly
what
yes
i
told
you
it
was
surprising
but
you
know
lorraine
hasn
t
missed
a
day
and
she
generally
has
her
lessons
perfect
she
s
like
me
her
greatest
trouble
is
with
her
themes
but
even
they
have
been
pretty
good
lately
and
so
you
see
her
average
has
crawled
up
so
i
wanted
to
tell
you
as
soon
as
i
could
because
you
must
work
harder
and
get
ahead
of
lorraine
somehow
of
course
we
all
want
you
to
have
the
prize
but
unless
you
re
careful
lorraine
will
get
i
like
to
get
the
general
prize
said
patty
but
i
d
like
for
lorraine
to
get
it
too
if
we
re
just
even
perhaps
miss
oliphant
will
divide
it
between
she
can
t
it
s
always
a
book
a
great
big
affair
of
poems
or
something
like
it
isn
t
the
book
i
care
for
it
s
the
honor
papa
would
be
so
pleased
if
i
won
the
general
prize
and
so
would
grandma
and
so
would
all
my
so
would
so
would
we
all
of
us
and
you
win
it
you
can
do
it
easily
enough
now
that
you
know
you
have
to
spur
up
a
little
to
get
ahead
of
lorraine
and
of
course
it
isn
t
likely
that
you
two
will
stay
just
even
if
you
don
t
get
ahead
of
lorraine
she
ll
probably
get
ahead
of
you
only
your
marks
happen
to
be
even
just
i
hope
they
stay
even
till
christmas
for
though
i
want
the
prize
i
don
t
want
to
take
it
away
from
don
t
be
silly
you
re
not
taking
it
away
from
her
any
more
than
you
are
from
the
rest
of
i
suppose
not
but
it
seems
so
when
our
marks
are
just
after
patty
went
home
she
thought
the
matter
over
seriously
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
so
much
happiness
in
her
life
and
lorraine
had
so
little
that
lorraine
ought
to
have
the
prize
for
that
reason
if
i
miss
a
lesson
or
two
thought
patty
that
will
throw
her
marks
ahead
for
i
m
sure
she
won
t
miss
any
but
even
then
i
m
afraid
i
ll
get
ahead
of
her
on
my
themes
i
wonder
if
it
would
be
right
for
me
to
lose
some
marks
on
purpose
that
she
may
get
the
prize
i
don
t
know
i
m
sure
and
i
hate
to
ask
papa
anything
like
this
for
it
sounds
so
silly
and
so
as
if
i
thought
myself
noble
like
i
do
hate
to
pose
as
a
martyr
and
anyway
it
isn
t
that
sort
of
a
spirit
at
all
it
s
only
just
a
fair
question
of
proportion
i
have
so
much
to
make
me
happy
and
lorraine
has
so
little
that
she
really
ought
to
have
the
prize
she
s
trying
awfully
hard
to
be
cheery
and
pleasant
and
to
get
the
general
prize
would
help
her
along
a
lot
so
i
think
it
s
right
for
me
to
manage
to
have
her
get
it
if
i
can
do
it
without
actual
the
more
patty
thought
it
over
the
more
she
felt
herself
justified
in
purposely
losing
the
prize
it
seemed
to
be
a
question
entirely
between
lorraine
and
herself
she
reasoned
that
if
she
didn
t
win
the
prize
it
must
necessarily
go
to
lorraine
and
though
she
felt
sorry
to
give
up
her
hope
of
it
yet
she
knew
she
would
be
more
truly
pleased
for
lorraine
to
have
it
of
course
she
would
never
tell
anybody
the
truth
of
the
matter
for
that
would
look
like
a
parade
of
her
unselfishness
and
patty
was
honestly
in
her
intent
but
as
she
thought
it
over
further
she
realised
that
it
would
take
a
continuous
and
systematic
missing
of
lessons
to
be
sure
of
reducing
her
average
sufficiently
this
was
not
a
pleasant
outlook
and
a
shorter
way
to
the
same
end
immediately
suggested
itself
if
she
were
marked
a
total
failure
on
her
theme
just
for
once
it
would
set
back
her
record
farther
than
many
missed
lessons
now
obviously
the
only
way
to
get
a
total
failure
for
a
theme
was
not
to
have
any
for
without
undue
egotism
patty
knew
well
that
her
themes
were
better
than
the
other
girls
and
of
course
were
marked
accordingly
purposely
to
write
a
poor
theme
would
be
silly
and
so
the
only
thing
to
do
would
be
to
have
no
theme
to
accomplish
this
it
would
be
necessary
to
stay
away
from
school
some
friday
for
to
be
there
without
a
theme
would
be
unprecedented
and
inexplicable
and
too
an
absence
of
a
whole
day
would
mean
no
marks
for
the
day
in
any
lesson
and
thus
the
end
desired
would
surely
be
attained
as
patty
s
theme
on
the
spirit
of
happiness
was
beyond
all
doubt
the
best
one
she
had
ever
written
she
concluded
that
that
friday
was
the
day
to
put
her
plan
in
operation
so
on
thursday
evening
she
casually
asked
her
father
if
she
might
not
stay
at
home
from
school
the
next
day
why
are
you
ill
child
said
fairfield
in
sudden
alarm
at
this
most
unusual
request
no
papa
i
m
perfectly
well
but
i
just
want
you
as
a
special
favour
to
let
me
stay
home
and
another
part
of
the
favour
is
that
neither
you
nor
grandma
shall
ask
why
of
course
my
dear
if
you
really
want
to
stay
home
you
may
and
i
promise
you
that
grandma
and
myself
will
never
seek
to
fathom
the
deep
and
dark
mystery
of
it
good
for
you
papa
you
re
a
trump
perhaps
some
time
i
ll
tell
you
all
about
it
and
perhaps
i
won
so
on
friday
patty
stayed
at
home
she
busied
herself
with
numberless
little
occupations
but
somehow
her
plan
now
that
it
was
in
operation
did
not
seem
quite
so
attractive
as
it
had
done
before
she
wondered
whether
after
all
it
wasn
t
quixotic
and
ridiculous
but
anyway
the
deed
was
done
now
and
she
must
abide
by
it
patty
never
cried
over
spilt
milk
and
having
committed
herself
to
her
course
she
dismissed
all
doubts
from
her
mind
to
strengthen
her
purpose
she
took
her
theme
from
her
desk
and
read
it
over
it
good
and
without
a
doubt
she
would
have
been
marked
very
high
for
it
her
spirits
rose
as
she
realised
that
even
though
lorraine
s
theme
might
not
be
marked
as
high
yet
whatever
its
marking
lorraine
would
stand
that
much
ahead
in
her
average
grandma
though
mystified
at
patty
s
remaining
at
home
said
nothing
whatever
on
the
subject
and
the
morning
passed
pleasantly
away
grandma
asked
patty
if
she
would
like
to
go
out
with
her
after
luncheon
and
do
a
little
shopping
and
patty
readily
acquiesced
after
they
were
seated
at
the
luncheon
table
patty
looked
across
the
room
to
where
the
hamiltons
usually
sat
and
there
to
her
amazement
sat
hamilton
and
lorraine
patty
s
face
showed
such
a
bewildered
expression
that
grandma
turned
to
follow
her
glance
why
she
exclaimed
lorraine
has
also
stayed
home
from
school
did
you
know
she
was
going
to
i
certainly
did
said
patty
emphatically
and
then
the
funny
side
of
the
situation
struck
her
and
she
began
to
laugh
at
the
same
time
lorraine
caught
sight
of
patty
and
she
too
looked
utterly
blank
with
consternation
and
dismay
and
then
she
too
laughed
after
luncheon
patty
took
possession
of
lorraine
and
carried
her
up
to
her
own
room
what
in
the
world
are
you
doing
at
home
she
demanded
first
what
are
doing
at
home
responded
lorraine
had
it
not
been
for
lorraine
s
peculiar
expression
and
quizzical
looks
patty
might
have
thought
she
had
stayed
at
home
for
reasons
in
no
way
connected
with
the
general
prize
but
the
girl
s
embarrassment
and
flustered
air
made
patty
wonder
if
they
weren
t
both
actuated
by
the
same
motive
look
here
lorraine
hamilton
she
said
going
straight
to
the
point
did
you
hear
what
flossy
fisher
overheard
miss
oliphant
say
why
what
do
you
mean
asked
lorraine
temporising
you
know
very
well
what
i
mean
you
why
flossy
told
me
that
she
heard
miss
oliphant
say
that
you
and
i
were
even
in
our
markings
but
what
of
that
and
you
stayed
home
said
patty
grabbing
lorraine
by
the
shoulders
and
looking
her
straight
in
the
eyes
you
stayed
home
so
that
i
might
get
ahead
of
you
lorraine
s
eyes
opened
wider
a
sudden
thought
had
struck
her
if
you
suspect
that
she
said
it
s
just
because
you
re
doing
the
same
thing
yourself
otherwise
you
never
would
have
thought
of
it
patty
fairfield
stayed
home
so
that
might
get
ahead
of
you
the
two
girls
read
confession
in
each
other
s
eyes
and
then
they
dropped
into
two
chairs
and
laughed
and
laughed
grandma
elliott
in
the
next
room
heard
the
shrieks
of
hilarity
and
concluded
that
some
girlish
secret
was
the
reason
of
patty
s
unusual
absence
from
school
the
idea
exclaimed
lorraine
as
the
beauty
of
patty
s
sacrifice
dawned
upon
her
how
you
do
such
a
thing
the
idea
cried
patty
touched
by
her
sudden
realisation
of
lorraine
s
loyalty
to
herself
how
could
do
such
a
thing
chapter
xx
two
confidential
interviews
when
the
two
girls
realised
that
they
had
done
identically
the
same
thing
and
each
had
chosen
precisely
the
same
way
to
advance
the
other
s
interests
it
will
be
hard
to
say
which
was
more
pleased
patty
was
deeply
touched
at
this
proof
of
lorraine
s
devotion
for
she
had
no
idea
the
girl
was
so
fond
of
her
and
too
she
had
not
thought
lorraine
capable
of
this
particular
way
of
showing
affection
lorraine
on
the
other
hand
was
almost
overcome
at
the
thought
of
the
merry
popular
patty
caring
enough
for
her
to
want
her
to
win
the
prize
the
result
was
that
a
strong
and
real
friendship
was
cemented
between
the
two
girls
and
lorraine
s
new
realisation
of
what
a
friendship
with
patty
stood
for
went
far
toward
helping
her
to
acquire
an
habitual
indeed
so
glad
and
gay
did
lorraine
become
over
the
whole
affair
that
patty
privately
concluded
she
was
quite
merry
enough
for
a
grig
and
determined
to
have
her
made
a
member
of
the
club
as
soon
as
possible
of
course
the
girls
never
told
of
this
episode
for
each
hesitated
to
exploit
her
own
share
in
the
matter
and
the
story
could
not
be
told
by
halves
and
so
the
teachers
and
the
schoolgirls
were
not
able
to
discover
why
the
two
star
pupils
remained
away
from
school
and
so
lost
their
marks
for
one
whole
day
but
the
fact
that
patty
and
lorraine
had
frustrated
each
other
s
plan
left
their
average
of
marks
still
even
although
they
might
fluctuate
a
little
from
day
to
day
yet
the
two
always
knew
their
lessons
and
though
patty
s
themes
were
usually
marked
higher
than
lorraine
s
that
was
offset
by
lorraine
s
greater
proficiency
in
mathematics
christmas
drew
nearer
and
somehow
the
girls
became
aware
that
lorraine
and
patty
were
evenly
matched
for
the
general
prize
and
that
each
was
anxious
for
the
other
to
win
it
not
that
they
told
this
in
so
many
words
but
their
discovered
it
and
the
excitement
about
it
was
considerable
patty
was
a
favourite
in
the
school
but
lorraine
by
the
improved
disposition
she
was
now
showing
had
also
won
many
friends
she
had
become
a
member
of
the
grigs
elise
had
by
no
means
been
dismissed
to
make
room
for
her
but
had
been
put
in
as
a
ninth
member
the
other
grigs
were
all
most
friendly
to
her
and
honestly
tried
to
show
their
appreciation
of
the
new
lorraine
some
of
them
even
went
so
far
as
to
hope
that
she
would
win
the
prize
and
that
for
the
very
same
reason
that
influenced
patty
so
sympathy
with
the
two
girls
was
pretty
fairly
divided
though
had
it
come
to
a
vote
probably
the
majority
would
have
been
in
patty
s
favour
as
it
came
nearer
to
christmas
the
race
was
most
exciting
it
seemed
now
that
the
two
girls
aimed
only
to
keep
even
it
might
have
been
coincidence
but
if
lorraine
missed
in
one
lesson
patty
was
pretty
sure
to
miss
in
another
and
if
patty
s
theme
was
a
little
less
excellent
than
usual
somehow
lorraine
s
mathematics
fell
off
a
trifle
but
patty
had
inherited
what
her
father
sometimes
called
the
fairfield
stubbornness
not
content
with
an
even
record
she
determined
that
lorraine
s
average
should
finally
be
found
ahead
of
hers
so
a
few
days
before
the
final
summing
up
she
went
to
miss
oliphant
s
study
and
asked
for
a
private
interview
the
girls
rarely
saw
the
principal
of
the
school
in
a
personal
way
as
her
intercourse
with
them
was
confined
almost
entirely
to
addresses
from
the
platform
patty
was
a
little
daunted
when
she
found
herself
in
the
austere
presence
of
miss
oliphant
for
she
realised
only
too
well
that
the
request
she
was
about
to
make
was
to
say
the
least
unconventional
miss
fairfield
said
miss
oliphant
not
unkindly
but
in
an
impersonal
tone
that
did
not
invite
confidential
conversation
what
can
i
do
for
you
why
you
see
miss
oliphant
said
patty
a
little
uncertain
how
to
begin
lorraine
hamilton
and
i
have
just
the
same
number
of
marks
on
our
record
so
as
one
of
us
must
take
the
general
prize
i
just
wanted
to
ask
you
if
you
couldn
t
arrange
it
so
that
lorraine
will
get
it
i
don
t
mean
to
do
anything
wrong
or
unfair
she
added
hastily
as
miss
oliphant
s
expression
of
amazement
seemed
to
rebuke
her
i
only
mean
that
if
there
should
be
any
doubt
in
marking
any
of
our
lessons
that
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
might
be
given
to
do
i
understand
said
miss
oliphant
severely
that
you
wish
miss
hamilton
to
be
marked
higher
than
she
deserves
patty
thought
this
remark
a
little
unjust
in
consequence
of
which
her
indignation
was
aroused
and
she
spoke
decidedly
though
very
courteously
no
miss
oliphant
i
do
not
mean
that
but
i
know
that
sometimes
it
is
difficult
for
a
teacher
to
feel
quite
certain
of
the
exact
mark
for
a
lesson
or
a
theme
and
in
such
cases
i
would
be
glad
if
lorraine
might
have
all
that
can
conscientiously
be
given
to
and
yourself
oh
miss
oliphant
said
patty
quite
forgetting
her
awe
of
the
stern
principal
in
her
eagerness
i
know
that
what
i
m
saying
sounds
ridiculous
but
you
must
i
mean
can
t
you
somehow
fix
it
that
lorraine
shall
have
a
little
higher
average
than
i
without
committing
a
state
s
prison
offence
miss
oliphant
unbent
in
spite
of
herself
why
do
you
want
to
do
this
my
child
she
asked
more
gently
than
she
had
spoken
before
why
hardly
know
how
to
explain
it
miss
oliphant
but
you
know
lorraine
doesn
t
have
the
best
times
in
the
world
and
she
isn
t
very
popular
with
the
least
she
didn
t
use
to
be
she
s
getting
more
so
it
will
make
her
so
happy
to
win
the
general
prize
i
m
sure
you
understand
miss
oliphant
that
i
don
t
mean
to
have
her
marked
wrongfully
but
just
a
little
favouring
would
throw
the
balance
over
to
her
somehow
miss
oliphant
seemed
more
amused
than
the
occasion
called
for
patty
had
been
prepared
to
find
her
irate
indignant
or
even
scornful
but
positively
there
was
a
smile
in
her
eyes
which
patty
had
never
seen
there
before
and
which
surprised
her
however
miss
oliphant
did
not
explain
her
attitude
and
only
said
to
patty
you
are
right
miss
fairfield
there
occasions
where
it
is
difficult
to
decide
upon
the
exact
marking
for
a
lesson
i
m
willing
to
assure
you
that
in
such
cases
miss
hamilton
s
record
shall
be
treated
with
all
the
leniency
possible
and
your
own
with
a
stricter
oh
thank
you
miss
oliphant
said
patty
impulsively
grasping
the
principal
s
hand
in
both
her
own
that
is
just
what
i
want
and
you
have
expressed
it
exactly
right
thank
you
very
much
and
of
is
a
confidential
conversation
inviolably
so
answered
miss
oliphant
and
again
the
amused
look
came
into
her
eyes
patty
left
the
room
feeling
that
at
last
she
had
conquered
if
miss
oliphant
did
as
she
had
patty
felt
sure
she
s
record
must
stand
the
highest
and
no
one
could
ever
guess
that
patty
had
done
anything
toward
bringing
it
about
a
day
or
two
later
miss
oliphant
received
a
visit
from
lorraine
partly
from
the
embarrassed
attitude
of
her
caller
and
partly
because
miss
oliphant
s
experience
had
taught
her
to
put
two
and
two
together
rather
successfully
she
intuitively
felt
that
lorraine
had
come
on
an
errand
similar
to
patty
s
and
this
was
the
truth
but
as
lorraine
was
of
a
less
ingenuous
nature
than
patty
and
had
not
as
good
reasons
for
confidence
in
the
sympathy
of
her
she
was
much
more
embarrassed
than
patty
had
been
and
found
it
more
difficult
to
make
her
requests
known
miss
oliphant
she
said
you
know
patty
fairfield
and
i
are
very
close
in
competition
for
the
general
prize
and
i
do
hope
she
will
get
it
she
deserves
it
far
more
than
i
why
said
miss
oliphant
with
sudden
directness
i
don
t
know
stammered
poor
lorraine
because
she
s
so
splendid
and
so
clever
and
she
always
knows
her
lessons
and
she
writes
such
beautiful
themes
i
love
her
so
then
i
gather
said
miss
oliphant
that
you
wish
the
general
prize
to
be
awarded
to
miss
fairfield
because
of
your
affection
for
her
and
not
because
she
has
justly
won
oh
no
miss
oliphant
not
that
said
lorraine
in
genuine
distress
at
her
inability
to
make
herself
understood
but
don
t
you
see
we
re
even
now
and
if
you
could
just
give
me
a
few
less
marks
and
patty
a
few
more
it
would
be
all
right
and
i
don
t
think
that
would
be
injustice
and
then
she
d
have
the
miss
oliphant
looked
decidedly
amused
now
the
smile
in
her
eyes
even
showed
itself
a
little
on
her
lips
your
sentiments
toward
your
friend
do
you
great
credit
miss
hamilton
she
said
but
i
can
not
say
that
i
entirely
approve
of
the
means
you
propose
to
use
do
you
think
it
right
to
mark
pupils
incorrectly
oh
no
not
as
a
general
thing
miss
oliphant
but
i
thought
you
wouldn
t
mind
just
a
little
scanting
of
my
record
no
one
need
ever
i
can
t
promise
exactly
what
you
ask
miss
hamilton
but
i
m
willing
to
say
that
in
so
far
as
it
can
be
done
within
the
most
liberal
interpretation
of
justice
it
shall
thank
you
miss
oliphant
and
lorraine
slid
away
from
the
presence
feeling
as
if
she
were
being
carried
off
wounded
after
a
battle
but
she
couldn
t
help
thinking
that
it
had
been
a
victorious
battle
for
miss
oliphant
s
evident
amusement
seemed
to
imply
an
acquiescence
in
the
plan
the
last
day
of
the
school
term
was
nearly
a
week
before
christmas
the
closing
exercises
were
of
a
somewhat
elaborate
nature
and
were
held
in
the
large
the
parents
of
the
pupils
were
invited
and
the
audience
was
a
large
one
patty
had
told
her
father
that
she
did
not
expect
the
general
prize
but
was
confident
that
lorraine
would
get
it
fairfield
had
teased
her
for
her
lack
of
ambition
in
not
winning
it
herself
but
patty
had
only
smiled
and
said
she
had
never
professed
to
be
a
prize
scholar
as
her
talents
lay
in
other
directions
lorraine
had
told
her
mother
that
she
had
no
expectation
of
taking
the
general
prize
but
strongly
believed
that
patty
fairfield
would
win
it
and
hamilton
had
responded
that
if
lorraine
couldn
t
have
it
she
certainly
hoped
it
would
be
given
to
patty
grandma
elliott
and
hamilton
attended
the
exercises
at
the
school
and
were
almost
as
excited
as
the
girls
themselves
over
the
question
of
the
prize
after
the
programme
which
was
not
a
long
one
the
prizes
were
awarded
various
small
honorariums
were
given
for
distinctive
studies
and
as
everybody
had
expected
patty
received
the
one
for
themes
and
lorraine
for
mathematics
but
the
interest
reached
its
height
when
miss
oliphant
took
from
the
table
a
large
and
elaborately
bound
volume
of
poems
which
she
announced
was
the
general
prize
to
be
awarded
to
the
pupil
who
had
the
highest
general
average
of
marks
in
all
departments
it
gives
me
pleasure
she
said
in
her
dignified
way
to
bestow
this
upon
miss
hilda
as
patty
told
her
father
afterwards
for
a
moment
you
could
have
heard
a
pin
drop
and
then
most
of
the
schoolgirls
especially
the
grigs
broke
into
an
irrepressible
though
stifled
giggle
miss
henderson
miss
oliphant
went
on
has
by
far
the
highest
record
and
has
had
for
the
past
few
weeks
the
next
highest
records
are
held
by
miss
fairfield
and
miss
hamilton
but
they
are
many
points
below
that
of
miss
henderson
s
though
all
show
good
as
miss
oliphant
made
these
remarks
she
looked
straight
at
lorraine
and
patty
and
though
her
grave
dignity
was
literally
unsmiling
yet
that
same
amused
look
was
in
her
eyes
and
both
girls
understood
that
their
solicitude
for
each
other
s
success
had
been
entirely
unnecessary
at
miss
oliphant
s
further
disclosures
the
grigs
became
more
and
more
impressed
with
the
humorous
side
of
the
affair
and
laughed
until
it
was
necessary
to
call
them
to
order
were
you
ever
so
surprised
in
all
your
life
cried
clementine
as
they
all
met
in
the
hilda
you
i
believe
you
knew
you
were
ahead
all
the
honestly
i
didn
t
avowed
hilda
i
had
no
idea
where
my
record
stood
flossy
said
patty
and
lorraine
were
at
the
top
so
i
supposed
they
i
see
it
all
said
patty
flossy
overheard
that
lorraine
and
i
were
even
and
we
just
took
it
for
granted
that
we
were
the
highest
nobody
said
we
were
so
much
for
being
patty
and
lorraine
never
intended
to
tell
each
other
of
their
interviews
with
miss
oliphant
but
owing
to
the
quizzical
look
on
the
principal
s
face
when
she
made
her
remarks
from
the
platform
the
girls
suspected
each
other
had
you
said
a
word
to
miss
oliphant
about
this
affair
said
patty
to
lorraine
as
they
walked
home
had
you
retorted
lorraine
come
on
now
said
patty
own
up
what
did
you
ask
her
to
do
will
you
confess
if
i
do
yes
now
that
it
s
all
over
we
may
as
well
tell
all
there
is
to
so
the
girls
told
each
other
of
their
interviews
and
compared
notes
regarding
miss
oliphant
s
attitude
on
those
memorable
occasions
and
to
think
exclaimed
patty
she
knew
hilda
was
way
ahead
of
us
all
the
time
and
never
told
us
i
don
t
wonder
she
was
well
said
lorraine
i
m
glad
there
was
one
thing
in
the
world
that
amuse
her
i
never
saw
her
come
so
near
smiling
nor
i
said
patty
chapter
xxi
the
cinderella
party
on
christmas
eve
clementine
was
to
give
a
party
it
was
to
be
of
the
kind
known
as
a
cinderella
party
that
is
the
guests
were
to
depart
exactly
at
twelve
o
clock
with
the
exception
of
the
hops
at
the
seashore
hotel
patty
had
never
been
to
a
regular
evening
party
and
she
looked
forward
to
the
event
with
great
delight
ruth
fleming
had
come
down
from
boston
to
spend
christmas
week
with
patty
so
of
course
she
too
was
invited
to
the
party
ruth
s
visit
had
come
about
in
this
way
patty
had
thought
she
would
ask
marian
to
visit
her
on
christmas
but
aunt
alice
had
insisted
that
the
fairfields
and
grandma
elliott
should
spend
christmas
with
them
in
vernondale
then
patty
thought
of
asking
ethelyn
clair
but
concluded
that
after
all
it
would
be
nicer
to
have
ruth
for
said
patty
to
her
father
ethelyn
has
lots
of
good
times
while
ruth
leads
an
awfully
life
to
be
sure
she
s
a
girl
the
very
one
i
ever
saw
but
that
s
all
the
more
reason
to
chirk
her
up
and
when
i
get
her
here
i
ll
make
her
have
fun
whether
she
wants
to
or
not
besides
i
had
ethelyn
and
bumble
barlow
both
to
visit
me
last
summer
and
i
ve
never
had
so
ruth
came
and
arrived
only
the
day
before
christmas
she
reached
the
wilberforce
in
the
morning
and
patty
was
surprised
to
see
how
little
change
a
year
had
made
in
the
boston
girl
she
was
just
the
same
mild
placid
unemotional
child
that
she
had
been
when
patty
saw
her
last
her
peculiarly
puritan
effect
was
still
evident
in
her
face
her
manner
and
her
dress
she
wore
a
plain
little
frock
of
a
dull
brown
with
a
jacket
and
hat
that
were
inconspicuously
in
her
quiet
way
she
seemed
truly
glad
to
see
patty
again
and
patty
knowing
ruth
s
natural
shyness
did
all
in
her
power
to
make
her
visitor
feel
at
ease
in
this
grandma
elliott
helped
for
that
dear
old
lady
had
a
knack
of
rendering
people
comfortable
and
too
her
heart
immediately
went
out
to
the
shy
new
england
girl
there
s
to
be
a
party
said
patty
whose
mind
was
full
of
this
subject
it
s
at
my
friend
clementine
morse
s
and
we
re
both
going
you
and
it
s
a
cinderella
party
and
papa
s
going
to
take
us
and
come
for
us
again
at
twelve
o
clock
won
t
it
be
fun
but
i
can
t
go
to
a
party
exclaimed
ruth
in
dismay
i
haven
t
any
party
frock
to
oh
pshaw
yes
you
have
your
best
dress
is
good
enough
whatever
it
is
where
is
it
let
s
unpack
your
things
and
look
at
but
patty
was
obliged
to
confess
that
ruth
had
spoken
truly
the
girl
s
best
dress
was
a
blue
cashmere
neat
and
well
made
and
trimmed
with
silk
to
match
but
patty
knew
that
among
the
light
and
pretty
evening
dresses
of
the
other
girls
it
would
look
altogether
out
of
place
it
isn
t
just
right
ruth
she
said
frankly
but
we
must
fix
you
up
somehow
do
you
suppose
you
could
wear
one
of
my
frocks
i
ve
lots
of
em
though
of
course
most
of
them
are
not
as
pretty
as
the
one
i
m
going
to
wear
myself
oh
patty
of
course
i
couldn
t
wear
your
dress
it
wouldn
t
fit
me
at
all
and
besides
i
don
t
care
to
go
to
the
party
truly
i
don
t
please
let
me
stay
at
home
with
elliott
and
you
go
without
me
i
ll
be
a
great
deal
i
patty
looked
at
her
guest
with
a
comical
smile
ruth
she
said
i
invited
you
down
here
to
have
a
good
time
and
you
ve
got
to
have
it
whether
you
want
it
or
not
so
don
t
tell
me
what
you
d
rather
do
but
just
make
up
your
mind
that
you
ll
do
as
i
patty
knew
ruth
well
enough
to
feel
sure
that
this
was
the
right
way
to
talk
to
her
once
at
the
party
she
thought
ruth
would
enjoy
herself
if
she
could
only
overcome
her
shyness
and
patty
had
already
planned
several
ways
to
assist
in
this
but
first
of
all
the
question
of
apparel
must
be
settled
patty
had
her
own
ideas
on
the
subject
and
after
a
conversation
over
the
telephone
with
her
father
who
was
down
at
his
office
patty
announced
to
grandma
and
ruth
that
they
would
all
go
on
a
shopping
expedition
that
very
morning
on
the
way
patty
informed
ruth
that
they
were
to
buy
her
a
new
party
frock
and
that
it
was
to
be
a
christmas
gift
from
patty
and
her
father
ruth
protested
but
patty
paid
no
heed
whatever
to
her
remonstrances
and
when
the
bewildering
array
of
pretty
dresses
was
exhibited
ruth
showed
almost
as
much
delighted
excitement
in
the
selection
as
patty
herself
after
much
discussion
and
trying
on
and
consultation
with
grandma
they
at
last
decided
on
a
simple
but
very
dainty
frock
of
light
blue
liberty
silk
it
had
a
lace
yoke
and
was
trimmed
here
and
there
with
bunches
of
tiny
flowers
of
a
slightly
darker
blue
the
effect
exactly
suited
ruth
s
fair
hair
and
grey
eyes
and
as
the
excitement
of
the
occasion
lent
colour
to
her
usually
pale
cheeks
patty
declared
she
was
a
perfect
picture
in
that
dress
and
there
was
no
use
looking
any
further
so
it
was
ordered
sent
home
at
once
and
then
the
shoppers
selected
gloves
slippers
and
all
the
delightful
little
accessories
of
the
costume
grandma
elliott
added
an
exquisite
fan
as
her
christmas
gift
to
ruth
and
then
the
trio
went
home
after
luncheon
patty
decreed
that
ruth
should
take
a
nap
in
order
to
be
bright
and
fresh
for
the
evening
and
as
ruth
had
found
it
was
quite
useless
to
try
to
combat
patty
s
will
she
obediently
went
to
her
room
patty
herself
was
so
full
of
excitement
she
could
not
have
slept
if
she
had
tried
she
unpacked
ruth
s
things
when
they
were
sent
home
and
laid
them
out
in
order
for
the
evening
she
flew
up
to
discuss
matters
with
lorraine
and
then
paid
a
flying
visit
to
the
harts
she
telephoned
to
clementine
and
to
elise
and
finally
settled
down
to
chat
with
grandma
about
the
coming
festivity
at
last
dinner
was
over
and
it
was
time
to
dress
for
the
great
occasion
patty
s
own
frock
was
all
of
white
a
distracting
affair
of
embroidered
muslin
and
fluffy
lace
ruffles
but
far
more
than
her
own
finery
patty
enjoyed
dressing
ruth
up
in
her
new
clothes
you
look
a
perfect
dream
in
that
blue
cried
patty
as
she
finished
hooking
up
ruth
s
dress
and
whirled
her
around
for
inspection
and
indeed
a
transformation
had
been
wrought
patty
had
curled
ruth
s
straight
blonde
hair
and
had
tied
it
with
two
big
blue
bows
made
of
ribbon
about
twice
as
wide
as
ruth
had
ever
worn
before
the
new
frock
was
most
becoming
and
ruth
saw
her
own
self
in
the
mirror
with
an
amazed
surprise
she
had
never
thought
of
possessing
the
slightest
claim
to
beauty
but
she
was
obliged
to
admit
that
on
this
occasion
she
had
certainly
achieved
it
the
truth
was
that
ruth
s
perfect
complexion
and
classic
features
needed
an
appropriate
setting
and
this
patty
had
provided
with
a
most
pleasing
result
patty
herself
was
delighted
with
her
success
she
exhibited
ruth
to
fairfield
quite
as
if
she
were
a
doll
which
she
had
dressed
up
for
her
own
benefit
even
fairfield
was
surprised
at
the
change
in
the
demure
maiden
and
congratulated
both
girls
on
their
charming
appearance
then
away
they
went
to
the
party
patty
gave
ruth
orders
to
the
effect
that
she
must
for
at
least
that
one
evening
make
her
demeanour
correspond
to
her
appearance
if
you
re
quiet
as
a
mouse
and
silent
as
a
mummy
you
won
t
have
any
fun
at
all
she
declared
you
must
talk
and
laugh
and
make
yourself
jolly
and
forget
that
you
re
as
shy
and
bashful
as
you
can
don
t
scare
the
poor
child
out
of
her
wits
said
fairfield
laughing
at
patty
s
vehemence
you
ll
make
her
more
embarrassed
than
oh
no
i
won
t
said
patty
ruth
s
all
right
if
you
scold
her
hard
enough
although
patty
s
method
might
not
answer
for
some
dispositions
it
was
successful
in
ruth
s
case
partly
because
of
patty
s
instructions
and
partly
because
the
consciousness
of
her
attractive
appearance
gave
her
confidence
ruth
seemed
entirely
to
lay
aside
her
shyness
and
fear
of
strangers
she
was
she
couldn
t
help
her
painful
almost
disappeared
and
she
was
bright
happy
and
responsive
the
young
people
liked
her
at
once
and
aided
by
their
warmhearted
welcome
ruth
responded
heartily
and
chatted
easily
and
gaily
with
them
all
it
must
be
admitted
that
this
state
of
affairs
had
been
largely
brought
about
by
patty
s
thoughtfulness
she
had
spoken
to
most
of
the
girls
and
had
asked
them
to
be
especially
cordial
to
ruth
and
to
try
their
best
to
put
the
stranger
at
her
ease
the
girls
had
not
only
done
this
but
had
given
their
brothers
hints
in
the
matter
and
as
a
consequence
ruth
did
not
lack
partners
for
the
dances
or
the
games
but
notwithstanding
her
plans
and
her
hopes
patty
was
amazed
to
see
how
far
ruth
exceeded
all
her
anticipations
the
girl
was
positively
a
belle
the
admiration
and
attention
she
received
was
such
a
novel
experience
that
it
had
the
effect
of
exhilarating
her
she
smiled
and
dimpled
her
eyes
danced
with
enjoyment
never
forward
or
unduly
hilarious
she
charmed
everyone
by
her
demure
gaiety
no
one
was
more
delighted
than
patty
at
her
friend
s
success
and
she
said
to
kenneth
i
m
so
glad
ruth
is
having
such
a
good
time
and
yet
i
m
so
surprised
for
i
never
saw
her
so
gay
and
sparkling
i
m
surprised
too
said
kenneth
for
from
what
you
told
me
about
her
i
imagined
her
a
prim
little
puritan
i
didn
t
intend
to
misrepresent
her
said
patty
but
it
must
be
the
influence
of
new
york
city
that
has
changed
her
she
never
was
like
that
in
i
think
it
s
your
influence
said
kenneth
for
you
always
make
everybody
happy
that
you
have
anything
to
do
oh
pshaw
i
didn
t
do
anything
for
her
except
to
help
her
pick
out
that
pretty
blue
frock
and
give
her
a
good
scolding
on
the
way
over
she
doesn
t
act
as
though
she
had
been
that
s
the
result
of
the
scolding
i
ordered
her
to
be
gay
and
glad
and
she
knew
she
had
to
obey
me
that
s
the
way
to
manage
a
girl
like
ruth
s
successful
in
no
way
detracted
from
patty
s
popularity
she
was
always
the
centre
of
a
merry
group
and
the
boys
flocked
around
her
like
bees
around
a
blossom
she
had
more
invitations
to
dance
than
she
could
possibly
accept
and
she
enjoyed
it
all
to
the
fullest
extent
of
her
nature
i
thought
i
d
never
get
a
chance
to
speak
to
you
said
roger
farrington
as
he
led
her
away
for
a
dance
you
always
have
such
a
crowd
around
well
you
can
be
part
of
the
crowd
returned
patty
saucily
i
don
t
want
to
be
part
i
want
to
be
the
whole
you
must
have
a
large
opinion
of
yourself
if
you
fancy
yourself
a
whole
well
i
never
see
you
anywhere
when
you
come
to
see
elise
i
m
not
at
home
and
when
she
goes
to
see
you
she
won
t
take
me
with
her
mayn
t
i
come
by
myself
some
day
miss
daggett
isn
t
visiting
me
now
said
patty
roguishly
well
miss
fleming
is
said
roger
teasing
in
return
sure
enough
and
i
do
want
to
make
it
pleasant
for
her
we
re
all
going
to
vernondale
for
christmas
but
i
d
be
glad
to
have
you
call
some
afternoon
next
week
ruth
will
stay
until
after
new
year
s
i
ll
be
delighted
to
come
said
roger
and
i
ll
bring
you
some
plants
for
your
they
whirled
away
in
the
dance
and
as
roger
was
a
particularly
good
dancer
patty
enjoyed
it
immensely
dancing
was
a
favourite
pastime
with
her
but
she
rarely
had
an
opportunity
to
enjoy
it
as
fairfield
did
not
approve
of
dancing
parties
for
schoolgirls
so
as
patty
did
not
attend
a
dancing
class
her
dances
were
limited
to
the
impromptu
ones
the
girls
sometimes
had
in
the
gymnasium
of
the
oliphant
school
chapter
xxii
it
after
several
dances
morse
proposed
that
the
young
people
should
play
a
game
of
some
sort
nobody
seemed
to
know
of
any
particular
game
to
play
until
ruth
volunteered
to
explain
to
them
a
new
game
that
had
recently
made
its
appearance
in
boston
the
game
was
called
it
and
was
great
fun
ruth
said
if
the
players
would
agree
to
keep
their
temper
all
present
willingly
agreed
to
do
this
it
s
really
only
difficult
for
one
explained
ruth
the
one
who
does
the
guessing
must
be
guaranteed
to
possess
a
temper
that
is
positively
incapable
of
being
ruffled
under
any
although
entirely
unfamiliar
with
the
details
of
ruth
s
game
it
suddenly
occurred
to
patty
that
here
was
an
excellent
chance
to
test
the
quality
of
lorraine
s
reform
in
the
matter
of
amiability
so
she
said
if
you
want
someone
to
do
your
guessing
i
propose
lorraine
lorraine
looked
up
suddenly
caught
patty
s
glance
and
determined
that
she
would
prove
herself
worthy
of
the
confidence
patty
had
shown
in
her
i
ll
do
it
she
said
and
i
ll
agree
not
to
lose
my
temper
whatever
your
game
may
you
ll
be
tempted
to
said
ruth
i
warn
you
that
it
is
a
most
exasperating
and
provoking
i
ll
risk
it
said
lorraine
what
must
i
do
first
first
you
must
leave
the
room
while
i
explain
the
game
to
the
others
said
ruth
go
out
in
the
hall
please
entirely
out
of
hearing
and
don
t
come
back
until
we
send
for
very
well
said
lorraine
gaily
when
you
want
me
you
ll
find
me
sitting
on
the
stairs
with
my
fingers
in
my
now
said
ruth
after
lorraine
had
gone
we
must
all
sit
round
in
a
sort
of
an
oblong
an
oblong
circle
is
easily
managed
said
clifford
morse
as
he
began
to
arrange
chairs
around
the
walls
of
the
long
parlour
the
other
boys
helped
him
and
soon
the
whole
party
were
sitting
in
a
continuous
ring
around
the
room
the
game
went
on
ruth
is
to
have
lorraine
guess
by
asking
questions
an
object
which
we
ve
all
agreed
upon
that
part
of
the
game
is
something
like
twenty
questions
but
the
difference
is
that
instead
of
taking
a
single
object
we
each
of
us
have
in
mind
our
for
instance
patty
s
neighbour
as
we
sit
is
kenneth
harper
but
his
neighbour
is
adelaide
hart
so
you
see
we
must
each
answer
lorraine
s
questions
truthfully
but
in
regard
to
the
person
who
sits
at
our
and
the
answers
will
seem
to
her
contradictory
and
patty
was
enough
to
see
at
once
that
these
conflicting
answers
would
seem
like
ridiculing
lorraine
s
intelligence
and
would
certainly
be
provoking
enough
to
make
anyone
angry
it
was
a
severe
test
but
she
privately
determined
that
if
lorraine
showed
signs
of
irritation
she
would
explain
the
game
at
once
and
not
allow
it
to
be
played
to
a
finish
when
everybody
thoroughly
understood
the
directions
clifford
went
out
and
escorted
lorraine
back
to
the
parlour
then
clifford
resumed
his
seat
and
lorraine
was
left
sitting
on
a
piano
stool
in
the
middle
of
the
room
so
that
she
might
twirl
about
and
face
each
one
in
turn
we
have
all
agreed
upon
an
object
said
ruth
which
we
want
you
to
guess
you
may
question
us
each
in
turn
and
you
may
ask
any
questions
you
choose
if
your
questions
can
be
answered
by
yes
or
no
we
re
obliged
to
answer
them
but
if
not
we
may
do
as
we
choose
about
it
now
suppose
you
begin
with
me
and
then
go
right
around
toward
the
wait
a
moment
lorraine
said
patty
before
you
start
remember
this
everything
we
tell
you
will
be
the
exact
truth
although
it
may
not
seem
very
well
said
lorraine
i
ll
begin
with
ruth
does
it
belong
to
the
animal
vegetable
or
mineral
kingdom
animal
answered
ruth
how
large
is
it
asked
lorraine
of
gertrude
lyons
who
sat
next
to
ruth
which
way
said
gertrude
laughing
well
how
long
is
it
about
two
yards
replied
gertrude
mentally
measuring
the
tall
boy
who
sat
on
her
right
what
colour
is
it
asked
lorraine
next
green
responded
dick
martin
with
a
glance
at
the
frock
of
the
girl
next
to
him
is
it
all
green
no
said
the
girl
in
green
it
is
mostly
this
of
course
was
true
as
her
neighbour
was
a
boy
in
black
clothes
lorraine
began
to
look
puzzled
it
seems
queer
she
said
that
one
of
you
should
say
it
is
all
green
and
another
that
it
is
mostly
black
but
i
suppose
one
of
you
must
be
they
all
laughed
at
this
and
lorraine
went
on
where
did
it
come
from
lorraine
asked
this
question
of
a
boy
who
sat
next
to
margaret
lane
who
was
from
philadelphia
from
philadelphia
he
replied
is
it
margaret
lane
asked
lorraine
of
margaret
herself
no
she
replied
laughing
is
it
anything
belonging
to
margaret
lane
has
it
any
connection
whatever
with
margaret
lane
none
that
i
know
to
whom
does
it
belong
lorraine
asked
this
question
of
a
girl
who
sat
next
to
a
young
cadet
from
west
point
so
she
replied
to
the
united
is
it
in
stripes
yes
replied
the
cadet
after
glancing
at
the
striped
dress
of
the
girl
next
to
him
then
it
s
the
flag
exclaimed
lorraine
triumphantly
but
they
all
told
her
she
had
guessed
wrong
and
she
went
on
with
her
queries
has
it
anything
to
do
with
the
army
nothing
except
that
it
carries
arms
said
the
waggish
boy
whom
she
asked
is
it
a
person
is
the
person
in
this
room
is
it
a
boy
or
girl
a
what
colour
hair
has
it
flaxen
was
the
answer
as
the
boy
she
asked
was
seated
next
to
a
girl
but
lorraine
having
been
told
it
was
a
boy
looked
around
the
room
for
a
boy
there
was
only
one
present
so
she
announced
triumphantly
then
it
is
ed
fisher
again
they
told
her
she
was
wrong
and
the
burst
of
laughter
at
her
bewilderment
would
have
greatly
offended
lorraine
had
it
not
been
for
her
determination
to
keep
her
temper
i
m
glad
you
told
me
that
you
re
all
telling
the
truth
she
said
for
i
m
sure
your
stories
don
t
agree
you
said
it
was
a
boy
and
had
flaxen
hair
and
ed
fisher
is
the
only
one
here
with
yellow
go
on
with
your
questions
said
patty
all
right
said
lorraine
beginning
where
she
had
left
off
what
colour
eyes
has
it
oh
then
of
course
it
isn
t
ed
fisher
now
patty
i
ve
come
to
you
is
it
kenneth
sat
on
patty
s
and
with
a
mischievous
twinkle
in
her
eyes
patty
replied
oh
not
they
all
laughed
at
this
and
lorraine
passing
on
to
kenneth
said
do
think
it
is
here
was
a
chance
to
tease
patty
in
return
for
adelaide
sat
on
kenneth
s
right
hand
and
the
boy
said
oh
beautiful
quite
the
person
i
then
they
all
laughed
again
and
lorraine
grew
more
and
more
bewildered
is
it
she
asked
of
adelaide
editha
sat
next
to
her
sister
and
so
adelaide
said
no
it
is
often
as
cross
as
a
then
said
lorraine
to
editha
is
it
myself
no
indeed
replied
editha
but
it
is
one
of
your
dearest
clementine
sat
next
and
lorraine
asked
her
does
it
go
to
the
oliphant
school
no
indeed
said
clementine
for
roger
farrington
was
her
neighbour
it
wouldn
t
be
allowed
there
wouldn
t
it
be
allowed
to
go
to
the
oliphant
school
demanded
lorraine
of
roger
why
it
go
there
said
roger
glancing
at
mary
sargent
does
it
mary
went
on
lorraine
no
said
mary
positively
i
m
sorry
to
contradict
roger
but
as
clementine
says
miss
oliphant
wouldn
t
let
it
come
to
our
which

i
to
believe
said
lorraine
then
to
clifford
morse
you
tell
me
clifford

it
go
to
our
school
yes
said
clifford
earnestly
it
certainly
does
well
said
lorraine
in
despair
i
ll
have
to
give
this
thing
up
i
believe
you
re
speaking
the
truth
but
there
seems
to
be
a
whole
lot
of
truths
however
i
ll
try
once
more
is
it
a
boy
or
a
girl
it
s
a
girl
declared
hilda
what
colour
dress
does
it
wear
flossy
black
said
flossy
thinking
of
the
boy
next
to
her
of
course
you
re
speaking
the
truth
said
lorraine
with
a
comical
smile
but
there
isn
t
a
girl
in
the
room
with
a
black
dress
on
what
s
her
dress
trimmed
with
ed
the
boy
looked
at
maude
carleton
who
sat
next
to
him
then
he
said
it
s
dress
is
trimmed
with
a
sort
of
feathery
fluffery
white
lacy
why
that
s
the
trimming
on
maude
s
dress
declaimed
lorraine
but
her
dress
isn
t
black
maude
it
no
said
maude
positively
i
give
it
up
said
lorraine
i
promised
to
keep
my
temper
and
i
have
i
promised
to
believe
you
all
told
me
the
truth
and
i
do
but
i
didn
t
promise
to
guess
your
old
it
and
i
can
t
do
it
i
give
it
you
re
a
trump
lorraine
cried
patty
anybody
else
would
have
been
as
mad
as
hops
long
before
this
now
we
ll
tell
so
they
explained
the
game
to
lorraine
and
she
realised
how
they
each
told
her
the
truth
although
it
didn
t
seem
so
at
the
time
she
was
glad
she
had
kept
about
it
though
it
had
been
more
of
an
effort
than
anyone
had
realised
then
other
games
were
played
which
were
less
of
a
tax
on
the
young
people
s
ingenuity
and
after
that
supper
was
served
morse
well
knew
how
to
provide
for
young
people
and
she
was
quite
prepared
for
the
demands
of
their
healthy
appetites
sandwiches
and
salad
disappeared
as
if
by
magic
jellies
ices
and
cake
followed
and
were
thoroughly
enjoyed
by
all
patty
and
ruth
with
lorraine
hilda
and
the
hart
girls
sat
in
a
little
group
at
one
end
of
the
while
the
boys
went
on
foraging
expeditions
and
returned
laden
with
all
sorts
of
good
things
it
s
almost
christmas
said
clifford
morse
what
are
you
going
to
do
patty
we
re
all
going
to
vernondale
for
a
couple
of
days
said
patty
and
when
we
come
back
i
want
you
all
to
come
and
see
ruth
some
i
m
going
to
vernondale
too
said
kenneth
my
aunt
has
invited
me
to
spend
the
day
in
fact
to
stay
as
long
as
i
choose
so
if
i
may
i
ll
go
on
the
you
may
if
you
ll
be
good
said
patty
but
grandma
doesn
t
like
bad
boys
and
ruth
is
afraid
of
i
ll
be
so
good
said
kenneth
that
elliott
won
t
know
me
and
i
ll
promise
not
to
scare
ruth
then
the
clock
struck
twelve
and
the
cinderella
party
was
over
everybody
started
for
hats
and
wraps
and
patty
found
her
father
awaiting
her
well
chickens
said
fairfield
as
he
bundled
the
two
tired
girls
into
the
carriage
did
you
have
a
good
time
lovely
exclaimed
patty
i
d
like
to
go
to
a
party
every
so
would
i
said
ruth
chapter
xxiii
christmas
christmas
day
was
fair
and
cold
as
patty
said
at
breakfast
it
was
in
all
respects
a
typical
christmas
except
that
there
was
no
snow
on
the
ground
and
that
she
hadn
t
heard
any
bells
nor
had
any
presents
as
yet
but
after
breakfast
the
last
condition
was
decidedly
changed
gifts
began
to
pour
in
and
what
with
untying
the
parcels
the
messengers
brought
and
the
other
parcels
which
had
arrived
before
but
had
been
kept
until
now
unopened
patty
and
ruth
were
as
busy
as
bees
all
the
girls
had
sent
christmas
remembrances
there
was
a
book
from
clementine
and
a
carved
bookrack
from
elise
hilda
sent
patty
an
brass
candlestick
and
lorraine
a
most
complicated
which
she
had
embroidered
herself
adelaide
gave
her
a
little
gilt
and
the
other
schoolgirls
sent
many
trinkets
and
trifles
nor
were
the
boys
negligent
of
patty
s
pleasure
roger
sent
a
great
box
of
holly
and
flowers
and
clifford
morse
sent
a
large
box
of
candy
other
boys
sent
various
christmas
cards
and
greetings
and
many
of
them
remembered
ruth
as
well
as
patty
the
new
england
girl
was
quite
bewildered
by
the
excitement
of
the
morning
for
they
were
to
take
the
train
for
vernondale
and
there
was
scarcely
time
to
look
at
all
the
gifts
before
they
started
patty
tore
open
the
parcels
rapidly
one
after
another
exclaimed
with
delight
at
their
contents
and
finally
scrabbled
all
the
into
a
big
heap
and
declared
it
was
time
to
dress
for
their
journey
the
fairfields
themselves
were
to
take
their
gifts
for
each
other
to
vernondale
for
in
the
evening
there
was
to
be
a
family
christmas
tree
at
aunt
alice
s
patty
had
of
course
prepared
gifts
for
all
the
elliott
family
as
also
had
grandma
elliott
and
fairfield
these
parcels
with
some
that
were
added
by
ruth
filled
two
large
and
then
there
were
left
several
bundles
to
be
carried
by
hand
when
the
party
left
the
wilberforce
with
all
this
patty
said
they
looked
as
if
they
had
been
dispossessed
at
the
ferry
they
met
kenneth
who
was
going
to
vernondale
on
the
same
train
the
boy
too
was
laden
with
christmas
luggage
and
merry
greetings
were
exchanged
i
ve
a
gift
here
for
each
of
you
girls
said
kenneth
but
i
can
t
find
it
now
among
all
this
trash
mayn
t
i
come
over
to
elliott
s
this
afternoon
and
bring
them
not
this
afternoon
said
patty
because
all
the
tea
club
girls
are
coming
to
see
me
then
and
we
wouldn
t
have
a
boy
around
for
anything
but
come
over
this
evening
when
we
have
the
christmas
tree
and
ask
miss
daggett
to
come
thank
you
i
ll
ask
her
with
pleasure
i
m
afraid
she
won
t
come
she
goes
out
so
little
but
i
hope
she
will
however
even
if
she
won
t
i
ll
run
over
for
a
few
moments
mr
hepworth
is
coming
this
evening
went
on
patty
and
he
s
going
to
bring
my
portrait
for
a
christmas
present
to
me
he
s
been
painting
it
you
know
and
it
s
finished
i
ve
never
seen
it
at
all
not
even
in
the
beginning
but
papa
says
it
s
a
very
good
likeness
i
m
crazy
to
see
why
exclaimed
kenneth
my
christmas
gift
for
you
is
a
portrait
of
yourself
also
and
i
ll
wager
anything
you
like
that
it
looks
more
like
you
than
the
one
hepworth
has
a
portrait
of
me
exclaimed
patty
why
can
t
i
didn
t
say
i
painted
it
and
it
isn
t
exactly
painted
anyway
but
it
s
a
portrait
of
you
and
it
looks
more
like
you
than
anything
hepworth
could
possibly
then
it
must
be
a
photograph
but
why
should
you
give
me
a
photograph
of
myself
is
it
in
a
frame
yes
a
pretty
little
florentine
then
the
gift
is
really
the
frame
but
i
don
t
see
why
you
put
photograph
in
it
and
anyway
i
didn
t
know
you
had
a
picture
of
me
pray
where
did
you
get
it
i
ll
show
it
to
ruth
said
kenneth
if
you
ll
promise
not
to
look
for
i
don
t
want
you
to
see
it
until
after
you
ve
expressed
your
opinion
of
hepworth
s
kenneth
unwrapped
a
parcel
and
taking
care
not
to
let
patty
see
ruth
looked
at
the
contents
oh
she
said
i
don
t
think
that
looks
like
patty
do
you
think
it
s
prettier
than
she
is
asked
kenneth
smiling
no
replied
ruth
smiling
too
i
don
t
think
it
s
half
as
pretty
as
well
said
kenneth
i
don
t
like
to
differ
with
you
but
do
you
know
i
think
patty
will
say
that
it
looks
exactly
like
her
and
that
it
doesn
t
flatter
her
a
i
believe
she
will
said
ruth
and
then
they
both
laughed
you
needn
t
think
i
m
curious
said
patty
i
can
easily
wait
until
evening
to
see
a
picture
of
myself
i
shall
take
it
out
of
the
frame
anyway
and
put
some
other
picture
when
they
reached
vernondale
kenneth
went
directly
to
his
aunt
s
and
the
others
went
to
elliott
s
the
whole
family
rushed
to
the
door
to
meet
them
and
there
was
a
general
hubbub
of
christmas
greetings
the
packages
and
bundles
were
whisked
away
by
frank
into
the
parlour
whose
doors
were
kept
carefully
closed
until
the
time
should
come
for
the
christmas
tree
marian
took
possession
of
patty
and
held
her
by
the
hand
as
if
afraid
she
would
run
away
oh
patty
she
kept
saying
i
m
glad
to
see
you
again
stay
a
long
time
won
t
you
ruth
was
by
no
means
neglected
for
the
elliotts
were
a
family
and
dearly
enjoyed
giving
pleasure
to
the
stranger
within
their
gates
about
half
an
hour
after
their
arrival
fairfield
looked
at
his
watch
and
declared
that
it
was
time
for
him
to
go
down
to
the
station
to
meet
the
philadelphia
train
oh
is
nan
coming
exclaimed
patty
for
this
was
a
surprise
to
her
well
i
ll
just
go
down
to
the
station
in
case
she
come
said
fairfield
smiling
oh
aunt
alice
cried
patty
it
was
lovely
of
you
to
ask
nan
now
we
ll
have
the
whole
family
fairfield
soon
returned
bringing
nan
who
looked
more
pretty
and
charming
than
ever
with
a
sprig
of
holly
tucked
among
her
furs
patty
flew
at
her
and
welcomed
her
warmly
for
she
dearly
loved
nan
and
had
not
seen
her
since
the
autumn
when
are
you
coming
to
new
york
cried
patty
and
are
you
coming
to
live
with
us
mother
and
i
are
going
to
new
york
soon
after
the
holidays
said
nan
but
i
don
t
think
i
shall
go
to
live
with
the
fairfields
until
about
easter
then
such
a
merry
christmas
dinner
as
they
had
everybody
talked
and
laughed
so
much
they
almost
forgot
to
eat
the
array
of
good
things
aunt
alice
had
provided
do
you
remember
our
last
family
party
asked
patty
it
was
at
boxley
hall
last
new
year
s
day
and
i
sat
at
the
head
of
the
yes
said
aunt
alice
and
a
very
graceful
and
capable
little
hostess
you
and
next
christmas
said
fairfield
the
fairfields
will
again
entertain
the
elliotts
and
fairfield
will
preside
at
her
own
nan
blushed
and
smiled
and
seconded
the
invitation
very
prettily
after
dinner
marian
carried
ruth
and
patty
off
to
her
own
room
to
await
the
coming
of
the
tea
club
girls
marian
and
ruth
seemed
to
like
each
other
at
once
and
when
the
other
girls
arrived
they
were
also
quite
ready
to
make
friends
with
the
boston
visitor
the
tea
club
girls
all
brought
little
gifts
to
patty
who
had
also
prepared
small
christmas
remembrances
for
them
the
tea
club
had
always
been
noted
for
its
merry
times
but
they
fairly
outdid
themselves
patty
told
them
they
were
as
merry
as
grigs
and
assured
them
that
higher
commendation
was
impossible
later
nan
joined
the
group
and
as
she
was
well
known
to
the
girls
from
her
visit
of
the
summer
before
they
were
all
delighted
to
see
her
again
at
six
o
clock
the
tea
club
girls
regretfully
went
home
all
promising
to
call
on
patty
again
early
the
next
morning
then
came
the
evening
fun
frank
declared
that
there
was
not
room
for
another
parcel
in
the
parlour
he
said
that
the
budget
nan
brought
was
the
last
straw
and
that
when
hepworth
and
kenneth
arrived
he
hoped
they
d
have
consideration
enough
not
to
bring
any
bundles
but
his
hopes
were
in
vain
for
not
only
did
the
two
come
well
laden
but
miss
daggett
accompanied
her
nephew
and
she
too
had
her
hands
full
however
room
was
made
somehow
and
at
last
frank
threw
open
the
parlour
doors
and
invited
them
all
to
come
in
although
the
tree
with
its
decorations
and
candles
was
ostensibly
for
the
little
children
edith
and
gilbert
yet
everybody
shared
in
the
enjoyment
of
it
and
everybody
had
so
many
presents
that
they
scarcely
had
time
to
look
at
the
others
gifts
fairfield
gave
patty
a
dear
little
watch
and
nan
gave
her
a
chatelaine
pin
to
wear
with
it
marian
gave
her
a
ring
ruth
a
book
and
everybody
present
gave
her
some
pretty
token
kenneth
announced
that
his
gift
for
patty
was
a
portrait
of
herself
but
he
was
not
willing
to
exhibit
it
until
after
hepworth
s
portrait
had
been
shown
for
he
felt
sure
his
was
the
better
likeness
hepworth
looked
a
little
surprised
at
this
but
said
he
was
quite
willing
to
have
his
work
criticised
and
he
unveiled
a
portrait
which
stood
on
an
easel
it
was
a
beautiful
picture
of
patty
and
though
perhaps
a
trifle
idealised
it
was
truly
a
portrait
of
the
girl
s
nature
and
showed
a
face
beaming
with
happiness
yet
with
earnest
eyes
that
betokened
the
dawning
of
a
sweet
and
true
everybody
was
delighted
with
it
there
could
be
no
adverse
criticism
on
such
a
beautiful
piece
of
work
while
the
others
were
exclaiming
over
its
merits
patty
expressed
her
thanks
a
little
shyly
to
hepworth
thank
you
she
said
for
thinking
that
i
look
like
that
i
wish
might
think
so
and
i
hope
i
may
some
day
possess
all
that
the
picture
seems
to
attribute
to
you
do
already
said
hepworth
then
kenneth
announced
that
he
would
now
show
his
portrait
of
patty
i
don
t
care
he
said
for
the
opinion
of
anybody
except
patty
herself
indeed
when
the
rest
of
you
look
at
it
i
m
quite
prepared
to
hear
you
say
it
doesn
t
resemble
her
in
the
least
but
i
m
sure
that
patty
will
say
it
is
a
perfect
with
a
flourish
the
boy
threw
off
the
and
handed
patty
a
flat
box
patty
took
from
the
box
a
gilt
florentine
frame
and
holding
it
so
that
the
others
could
see
only
the
back
she
gazed
at
the
picture
it
contained
and
said
you
are
right
kenneth
it
is
a
perfect
likeness
and
i
must
confess
it
is
a
more
exact
portrait
of
me
than
hepworth
s
though
his
is
far
more
then
patty
turned
the
frame
around
and
showed
that
it
contained
no
portrait
at
all
but
a
mirror
how
everybody
laughed
at
kenneth
s
joke
and
hepworth
picked
up
the
mirror
and
looking
in
it
said
well
if
you
think
looks
like
miss
fairfield
why
my
picture
of
her
is
a
better
likeness
i
said
nobody
would
agree
with
me
except
patty
replied
kenneth
and
i
m
more
than
willing
to
admit
the
merits
of
your
the
rest
of
the
evening
was
spent
in
merry
games
and
fun
and
even
the
little
children
were
allowed
to
sit
up
until
the
close
of
the
festivities
miss
daggett
enjoyed
herself
thoroughly
and
so
did
ruth
as
for
the
elliotts
and
fairfields
it
is
not
necessary
to
say
that
they
had
a
good
time
i
suppose
you
care
more
for
hepworth
s
gift
than
you
do
for
mine
said
kenneth
as
he
and
patty
stood
looking
at
the
portrait
later
in
the
evening
i
don
t
know
said
patty
of
course
his
is
of
far
greater
value
in
every
way
went
on
kenneth
so
if
you
did
care
more
for
mine
it
would
be
because
you
cared
more
for
me
do
you

interest

stories
from
a

thirty
comes
a
vote
of
naming
her
as
their
favorite
author
perhaps
it
is
the
element
of
live
mystery
that
garis
always
builds
her
stories
upon
or
perhaps
it
is
because
the

easily
can
translate
her
own
sincere
interest
in
themselves
from
the

at
any

her
books
prosper
through
the

of
these

giving
pleasure

and
incidentally
that
tactful
word
of
inspiration
so
important

for

garis
prefers
