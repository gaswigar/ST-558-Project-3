introduction
i
certainly
have
no
desire
to
frighten
the
female
readers
to
whom
this
free
rendering
of
one
of
zola
best
books
so
largely
appeals
it
is
indeed
a
book
with
a
good
sound
moral
fit
for
every
thoughtful
woman
to
peruse
but
in
endeavouring
to
point
out
its
scope
and
purport
i
must
in
the
first
instance
refer
to
some
matters
in
which
women
as
nowadays
educated
take
as
a
rule
but
the
scantiest
of
interest
still
many
of
them
may
have
heard
that
in
the
opinion
of
various
seers
and
prophets
the
future
of
the
human
race
lies
in
collectivism
a
prediction
which
i
do
not
intend
to
discuss
but
respecting
which
i
may
remark
that
during
the
last
half
century
in
this
country
there
has
certainly
been
a
tendency
in
the
direction
indicated
even
amongst
classes
which
profess
to
hold
every
form
of
socialism
in
horror
this
tendency
towards
collectivism
has
manifested
itself
notably
in
certain
trades
and
industries
by
the
introduction
of
various
forms
of
by
the
amalgamation
too
of
rival
businesses
and
even
by
the
formation
of
which
evil
and
unjust
as
they
may
appear
to
some
nevertheless
rejoice
the
heart
of
many
socialists
who
consider
that
the
fewer
the
individual
interests
to
be
overthrown
the
easier
will
be
their
task
of
conquest
when
the
time
shall
come
for
olden
society
to
give
up
the
ghost
and
further
a
tendency
towards
collectivism
is
also
to
be
traced
in
the
establishment
of
those
great
universal
providing
concerns
which
we
know
by
the
name
of
stores
and
which
many
a
socialist
will
tell
you
are
but
the
forerunners
of
the
colossal
magazines
of
distribution
which
will
become
necessary
when
collectivism
shall
have
attained
its
ends
on
all
sides
nowadays
the
small
trader
and
the
small
manufacturer
are
assailed
and
in
many
instances
can
barely
hold
their
own
for
cheapness
is
the
god
of
the
hour
and
in
cheapness
they
can
not
hope
to
compete
with
those
who
operate
upon
a
colossal
scale
whether
they
will
ultimately
be
obliged
to
give
up
the
contest
whether
the
passion
for
individuality
is
destined
to
depart
from
the
human
race
these
and
the
many
other
questions
which
the
problem
suggests
i
will
leave
to
the
collectivist
prophets
and
to
those
who
oppose
their
doctrines
in
our
reviews
and
newspapers
i
have
merely
desired
to
call
the
attention
to
this
problem
and
to
the
tendencies
previously
referred
to
because
he
or
she
will
find
that
they
constitute
no
small
portion
of
the
subject
of
the
present
volume
of
zola
works
in
au
bonheur
des
dames
zola
has
taken
as
his
theme
a
particular
phase
of
the
amalgamation
and
universal
providing
tendencies
as
they
have
presented
themselves
in
france
and
the
phase
in
question
is
certainly
one
of
the
most
interesting
if
only
for
the
fact
that
it
is
so
closely
connected
with
the
desires
and
needs
of
women
in
a
word
the
work
deals
with
those
huge
drapery
establishments
like
the
bon
marché
and
the
louvre
which
are
renowned
throughout
the
world
we
have
no
doubt
several
very
large
draper
emporiums
in
london
but
i
do
not
think
that
any
one
of
them
can
claim
to
rival
either
in
dimensions
extent
of
business
or
completeness
of
organisation
the
great
french
establishments
to
which
i
have
referred
above
i
can
myself
well
remember
the
growth
of
the
bon
marché
and
the
louvre
transferred
when
my
education
was
but
from
the
solitude
of
the
sussex
downs
to
the
whirling
vortex
of
paris
i
grew
up
amongst
those
haussmannite
transformations
which
virtually
made
the
french
capital
a
new
city
a
city
which
became
my
home
for
well
nigh
twenty
years
even
now
i
am
but
a
stranger
in
my
own
land
among
my
own
kith
and
kin
and
my
memory
ever
dwells
on
those
years
when
i
saw
paris
develop
opening
her
streets
to
air
and
light
and
health
increasing
her
wealth
and
her
activity
on
the
one
hand
multiplying
her
workshops
ever
busy
thanks
to
the
taste
and
dexterity
of
her
craftsmen
and
on
the
other
by
the
attraction
of
a
thousand
pleasures
becoming
the
caravanserai
of
europe
and
my
fanatical
admiration
for
zola
and
for
all
his
works
the
passion
which
has
induced
me
to
translate
so
many
of
them
arises
mainly
from
the
fact
that
they
deal
so
largely
with
paris
and
her
life
at
a
period
which
i
so
well
remember
with
scenes
and
incidents
which
i
can
so
readily
recall
and
which
carry
me
back
to
the
days
when
the
heart
was
light
and
buoyant
and
sorrow
was
a
thing
unknown
and
when
now
and
again
sundry
supercilious
english
critics
qualified
by
a
smattering
of
french
and
a
few
months
residence
in
france
presume
to
sneer
at
zola
pictures
of
french
manners
and
customs
in
the
days
of
the
second
empire
i
merely
shrug
my
shoulders
at
their
ignorance
for
my
own
part
i
believe
for
like
thomas
i
have
seen
among
the
subjects
dealt
with
by
zola
in
the
series
that
of
the
present
work
the
development
of
the
great
de
is
to
me
one
of
the
most
familiar
for
the
reason
that
i
have
always
taken
a
keen
interest
in
the
attire
and
adornment
of
women
and
in
my
salad
days
wrote
some
hundreds
of
columns
of
articles
for
english
newspapers
and
my
duties
in
those
days
took
me
not
only
to
the
of
worth
pingat
and
other
à
la
but
also
to
the
great
drapers
for
if
on
the
one
hand
i
learned
in
the
former
establishments
what
would
be
worn
by
royalty
aristocracy
and
fashionable
depravity
on
the
other
in
the
huge
bazaars
similar
to
au
bonheur
des
dames
i
ascertained
what
would
be
the
popular
craze
of
the
hour
the
material
which
would
be
seen
on
the
back
of
every
second
woman
one
might
meet
and
the
one
or
two
colours
which
for
a
few
months
would
catch
the
eye
at
every
street
corner
all
this
may
seem
to
be
frivolity
but
it
is
on
such
frivolity
that
a
goodly
portion
of
civilized
humanity
subsists
i
find
andré
cochut
a
well
informed
writer
holding
an
official
position
stating
in
a
year
which
comes
within
the
period
i
am
referring
to
that
there
were
then
shops
and
in
paris
which
sold
or
made
almost
exclusively
articles
of
female
attire
and
these
establishments
many
of
course
very
small
gave
employment
to
nearly
persons
of
both
sexes
among
whom
there
were
designers
moreover
the
trade
of
paris
in
materials
and
goods
was
estimated
at
millions
of
francs
or
under
these
circumstances
that
paris
should
have
claimed
the
sovereignty
of
fashion
is
i
think
not
surprising
nowadays
the
number
of
establishments
selling
or
making
goods
for
feminine
attire
has
undoubtedly
decreased
but
the
trade
is
greater
than
ever
well
nigh
the
only
alteration
one
can
trace
is
that
many
of
the
smaller
houses
have
been
swallowed
up
by
their
big
rivals
in
accordance
with
the
usual
conditions
of
the
struggle
for
life
the
big
establishments
did
not
however
step
into
the
arena
huge
like
goliaths
and
armed
as
zola
relates
in
the
following
pages
they
likewise
had
humble
beginnings
and
would
never
have
expanded
as
they
did
but
for
the
commercial
genius
of
their
founders
i
remember
the
bon
marché
having
but
one
entrance
in
the
rue
du
bac
near
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
sèvres
and
ranking
in
the
opinion
of
the
women
of
the
neighbourhood
far
below
the
petit
thomas
which
it
has
since
altogether
outstripped
in
the
same
way
the
huge
block
of
building
now
occupied
by
the
magasins
du
louvre
comprised
some
forty
different
shops
held
by
different
tenants
indeed
the
pile
had
originally
been
erected
for
an
hotel
the
grand
hôtel
du
louvre
and
the
shops
even
those
bearing
the
name
of
the
louvre
were
at
the
outset
only
a
secondary
consideration
but
gradually
a
transformation
was
effected
the
drapery
emporium
became
larger
and
larger
secured
the
adjoining
shops
and
ultimately
invaded
the
hotel
itself
certainly
all
this
was
not
easily
brought
about
many
neighbouring
tenants
refused
to
give
way
to
the
monster
and
clung
stubbornly
to
their
leases
fighting
the
unequal
battle
with
the
utmost
obstinacy
an
obstinacy
such
as
that
which
the
baudus
and
old
bourras
the
umbrella
maker
will
be
found
displaying
in
pages
in
the
case
of
the
louvre
the
last
of
these
stubborn
antagonists
was
if
i
recollect
rightly
a
stationer
whose
shop
fronted
on
the
place
du
palais
royal
and
i
believe
that
he
held
out
until
his
lease
fell
in
at
the
bon
marché
too
the
boucicauts
had
to
contend
against
similar
obstacles
and
there
the
enlargement
of
the
premises
was
attended
by
difficulties
akin
to
those
which
zola
describes
for
many
of
the
adjoining
houses
were
decrepit
vestiges
of
olden
paris
and
each
time
the
bon
marché
gained
a
few
yards
of
frontage
expensive
building
operations
had
to
be
carried
out
in
his
present
work
zola
has
of
course
not
taken
as
his
theme
the
actual
history
of
either
of
the
great
establishments
to
which
i
have
been
referring
but
from
that
history
and
from
the
history
of
other
important
de
he
has
borrowed
a
multitude
of
curious
and
interesting
facts
which
he
has
blended
into
a
realistic
whole
curiously
enough
the
site
which
he
has
chosen
for
au
bonheur
des
dames
was
really
the
site
of
a
fairly
large
drapery
emporium
which
became
the
grands
magasins
du
septembre
but
perhaps
that
title
savouring
as
it
did
of
revolution
the
revolution
of
brought
the
establishment
bad
luck
with
women
caring
little
or
nothing
for
politics
for
it
failed
to
attain
the
success
to
which
its
central
situation
seemed
to
entitle
it
the
place
clichy
to
which
zola
will
be
found
referring
still
exists
and
does
a
largely
increasing
business
with
all
the
north
of
paris
whilst
as
for
the
four
seasons
which
one
of
his
characters
bouthemont
the
establishes
near
the
grand
this
is
really
the
printemps
that
white
and
blue
and
gilded
palace
which
the
parisians
owe
to
the
commercial
enterprise
of
jules
jaluzot
by
some
people
unkindly
nicknamed
the
man
with
the
umbrella
i
have
often
thought
that
from
the
commercial
point
of
view
there
is
considerable
resemblance
between
jaluzot
and
zola
hero
octave
mouret
the
latter
figures
at
an
earlier
stage
of
his
life
in
another
of
zola
novels
but
he
there
appears
as
a
graceless
don
juan
without
a
redeeming
quality
whereas
in
the
present
work
one
observes
the
development
of
his
business
capacities
and
the
gradual
progress
of
his
reformation
till
his
career
culminates
in
a
marriage
which
ought
to
prove
a
very
happy
one
if
there
be
any
truth
in
the
old
saw
that
a
reformed
rake
makes
the
best
of
husbands
i
have
however
no
desire
to
institute
the
faintest
comparison
between
the
private
life
of
octave
mouret
and
that
of
jaluzot
but
in
describing
the
commercial
genius
and
boldness
zola
has
i
think
more
than
once
thought
of
the
latter
hardihood
and
talent
in
carving
for
himself
a
great
industrial
kingdom
beside
those
of
the
bon
marché
and
the
louvre
jaluzot
is
famous
in
paris
for
the
rare
ability
he
displays
in
turning
everything
into
advertisement
and
this
of
course
is
an
extremely
valuable
gift
as
advertisement
is
the
very
life
of
the
huge
de
some
years
ago
the
printemps
was
burnt
down
and
when
the
necessary
rebuilding
operations
began
jaluzot
prevailed
upon
the
cardinal
archbishop
of
paris
to
come
and
bless
the
foundation
stone
of
the
new
edifice
this
inspiration
well
worthy
of
zola
hero
secured
to
jaluzot
extensive
patronage
among
the
devout
and
it
was
important
at
the
time
that
he
should
reconcile
himself
with
society
for
on
the
occasion
of
the
burning
of
his
establishment
the
entire
parisian
press
had
reproached
him
with
showing
greater
eagerness
to
rush
off
and
purchase
an
umbrella
for
protection
against
a
shower
than
to
minister
to
the
needs
of
the
numerous
employees
who
had
been
cast
on
the
pavement
of
paris
by
the
catastrophe
hence
the
nickname
to
which
i
have
previously
referred
with
the
life
of
the
parisian
drapery
employee
the
present
work
is
very
largely
concerned
from
the
personal
investigations
i
made
at
former
times
the
many
conversations
i
had
with
employees
of
this
class
the
numerous
corroborative
statements
i
have
read
in
the
works
of
other
french
writers
i
believe
zola
pictures
of
the
counter
jumper
existence
at
the
period
dealt
with
to
be
scrupulously
accurate
it
will
be
noticed
that
these
pictures
slowly
change
in
certain
respects
as
the
story
proceeds
mouret
at
last
begins
to
take
more
interest
in
the
material
comforts
of
his
staff
provides
it
with
better
food
and
treats
it
generally
in
a
more
reasonable
manner
whilst
among
the
employees
themselves
their
depravity
and
vulgarity
hidden
beneath
a
surface
elegance
and
politeness
is
at
times
altogether
stamped
out
at
others
thrust
back
far
more
deeply
to
the
boucicauts
of
the
bon
marché
largely
belongs
the
honour
of
having
improved
the
material
and
raised
the
moral
tone
of
shopmen
of
this
class
and
their
example
has
been
very
generally
followed
still
as
every
paris
calicot
well
knows
there
is
one
great
emporium
whose
internal
organization
is
still
open
to
serious
criticism
calicot
i
may
mention
is
the
french
equivalent
of
our
term
and
in
this
introduction
to
a
work
which
deals
so
largely
with
the
calicot
life
it
may
not
be
out
of
place
to
explain
the
origin
of
the
nickname
it
dates
from
when
a
vaudeville
called
combat
des
montagnes
ou
la
by
scribe
and
dupin
was
performed
at
the
paris
théâtre
des
variétés
at
that
period
with
the
wars
of
the
empire
still
fresh
in
their
recollection
the
parisians
generally
evinced
a
cordial
respect
for
those
who
had
seen
service
and
the
young
men
of
the
capital
promenading
on
the
boulevards
were
fond
of
affecting
a
military
appearance
and
demeanour
matters
even
came
to
such
a
pass
that
as
they
were
then
called
cultivated
huge
moustaches
and
wore
spurs
on
their
boots
even
when
behind
their
counters
to
this
ridiculous
craze
scribe
and
dupin
alluded
in
their
vaudeville
into
which
they
introduced
a
certain
called
monsieur
calicot
whom
the
other
characters
of
the
play
at
first
mistook
for
some
survivor
of
the
old
guard
the
result
as
might
have
been
expected
was
an
explosion
of
rage
among
all
the
drapery
employees
of
paris
they
besieged
the
theatre
and
desperate
and
sanguinary
battles
ensued
in
the
auditorium
the
authorities
however
declined
to
place
the
vaudeville
under
interdict
and
after
several
interventions
on
the
part
of
the
police
the
irate
employees
were
cowed
by
the
presence
of
a
detachment
of
grenadiers
who
with
loaded
muskets
stood
on
either
side
of
the
stage
throughout
each
performance
and
from
that
time
to
the
present
day
calicot
has
been
french
for
so
far
as
drapery
is
concerned
however
the
vaudeville
did
not
cure
the
calicot
of
his
partiality
for
moustaches
these
he
still
cultivates
as
all
who
have
been
in
paris
well
know
indeed
he
frequently
grows
a
beard
as
well
but
as
such
hirsute
appendages
have
long
since
ceased
to
be
the
exclusive
property
of
the
military
nobody
taunts
him
with
affectation
concerning
them
on
the
other
hand
he
has
wisely
renounced
the
practice
of
wearing
spurs
behind
his
counter
and
if
he
sometimes
evinces
a
little
military
precision
or
even
swagger
it
would
be
unwise
to
deem
this
assumed
for
in
these
days
of
the
universal
conscription
it
may
well
have
been
acquired
by
real
service
in
the
ranks
indeed
we
must
not
sneer
at
the
calicot
he
answers
his
country
call
as
readily
as
any
other
of
her
sons
it
remains
for
me
to
say
a
few
words
concerning
the
moral
of
this
book
the
story
of
denise
struggles
hardships
and
temptations
her
quiet
courage
and
gentle
steadfastness
is
invested
by
zola
with
that
simple
pathos
which
adorns
so
many
of
his
works
the
young
girl
passes
through
the
fire
and
emerges
from
it
unscathed
protected
by
her
own
sense
of
rectitude
and
the
purity
of
her
love
whilst
others
alas
are
devoured
no
more
beautiful
example
of
feminine
resistance
to
evil
could
be
imagined
we
follow
the
heroine
fortunes
with
emotional
interest
and
take
a
kindly
satisfaction
in
her
reward
possibly
we
might
wish
that
she
had
loved
a
somewhat
worthier
man
than
mouret
in
whom
there
are
many
moral
blemishes
but
the
reflection
imposes
itself
that
under
her
caressing
influence
these
blemishes
will
disappear
that
mouret
will
throw
off
all
that
remains
in
him
of
the
old
adam
and
prove
worthy
of
the
love
that
he
himself
feels
and
has
inspired
and
surely
woman
love
can
have
no
holier
mission
than
that
of
the
reformation
of
man
what
moreover
would
become
of
humanity
if
a
woman
heart
were
to
be
given
only
to
the
immaculate
in
accordance
with
the
paradoxical
dictum
of
some
latter
day
does
not
the
woman
who
brings
an
erring
man
back
into
the
straight
path
that
he
may
contribute
to
the
common
weal
achieve
more
good
than
she
who
simply
plights
her
troth
to
one
as
blameless
as
herself
and
thus
a
halo
encircles
heroine
denise
the
personification
of
all
that
is
best
and
truest
in
the
female
heart
one
word
more
the
compass
of
the
present
introduction
does
not
permit
me
to
establish
a
comparison
between
the
relative
positions
of
french
and
english
salesmen
and
women
in
the
great
drapery
establishments
i
fear
however
from
all
i
have
heard
that
several
of
strictures
on
the
treatment
meted
out
to
the
employees
of
octave
mouret
bazaar
might
be
applied
to
english
houses
and
thus
whilst
i
recommend
this
book
to
women
whom
its
subject
can
not
fail
to
interest
and
who
will
take
a
warning
from
the
extravagance
of
madame
marty
and
find
a
bright
example
in
the
unswerving
rectitude
of
denise
i
also
submit
it
to
the
attention
of
those
who
are
seeking
in
this
country
to
improve
the
position
of
shop
employees
for
i
feel
certain
that
they
will
find
many
a
useful
hint
in
its
searching
and
accurate
pages
ernest
vizetelly
may
i
find
that
brunet
who
played
the
part
of
calicot
wore
the
following
typical
costume
high
boots
with
spurs
white
trousers
a
buff
waistcoat
and
a
frock
coat
made
of
a
green
and
white
mixture
à
la
as
the
tailors
of
those
days
termed
it
the
ladies
paradise
chapter
denise
had
come
on
foot
from
the
railway
station
where
a
cherbourg
train
had
landed
her
and
her
two
brothers
after
a
night
spent
on
the
hard
seat
of
a
carriage
she
was
leading
pépé
by
the
hand
while
jean
followed
her
all
three
of
them
exhausted
by
their
journey
frightened
and
lost
in
that
vast
city
of
paris
their
eyes
raised
to
the
house
fronts
and
their
tongues
for
ever
inquiring
the
way
to
the
rue
de
la
michodière
where
their
uncle
baudu
lived
however
as
she
at
last
emerged
into
the
place
gaillon
the
girl
stopped
short
in
astonishment
oh
just
look
there
jean
said
she
and
they
remained
stock
still
nestling
close
to
one
another
dressed
from
head
to
foot
in
black
the
old
mourning
bought
at
their
father
death
denise
rather
puny
for
her
twenty
years
was
carrying
a
small
parcel
in
one
hand
while
on
the
other
side
her
little
brother
five
years
old
clung
to
her
arm
and
in
the
rear
her
big
brother
in
the
flower
of
his
sixteen
summers
stood
erect
with
dangling
arms
well
i
never
said
she
after
a
pause
that
a
shop
they
were
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
la
michodière
and
the
rue
in
front
of
a
draper
shop
whose
windows
displayed
a
wealth
of
bright
colour
in
the
soft
pale
october
light
eight
was
striking
at
the
church
of
and
only
the
early
birds
of
paris
were
abroad
a
few
clerks
on
their
way
to
business
and
housewives
flitting
about
on
their
morning
shopping
before
the
door
of
the
drapery
establishment
two
shopmen
mounted
on
a
were
hanging
up
some
woollen
goods
whilst
in
a
window
facing
the
rue
another
young
man
kneeling
with
his
back
to
the
pavement
was
delicately
plaiting
a
piece
of
blue
silk
in
the
shop
which
was
as
yet
void
of
customers
and
whose
employees
were
only
just
beginning
to
arrive
there
was
a
low
buzz
as
in
a
bee
hive
just
awakening
by
jove
said
jean
this
beats
valognes
yours
was
such
a
fine
shop
denise
shook
her
head
she
had
spent
two
years
at
valognes
with
cornaille
the
principal
draper
in
the
town
and
this
parisian
shop
so
suddenly
encountered
and
to
her
so
vast
made
her
heart
swell
and
detained
her
there
interested
impressed
forgetful
of
everything
else
the
lofty
door
in
a
corner
facing
the
place
gaillon
reached
the
first
storey
amidst
a
medley
of
ornaments
covered
with
gilding
two
allegorical
female
figures
with
laughing
faces
and
bare
bosoms
unrolled
a
scroll
bearing
the
inscription
the
paradise
then
on
either
side
along
the
rue
de
la
michodière
and
the
rue
stretched
the
windows
of
the
establishment
not
limited
merely
to
the
corner
house
but
comprising
four
others
two
on
the
right
and
two
on
the
left
which
had
been
recently
purchased
and
fitted
up
it
all
appeared
endless
to
denise
thus
seen
in
perspective
with
the
display
down
below
and
the
plate
glass
windows
above
through
which
a
long
line
of
counters
was
to
be
perceived
upstairs
a
young
lady
dressed
in
silk
could
be
espied
sharpening
a
pencil
while
two
others
beside
her
were
unfolding
some
velvet
mantles
the
ladies
paradise
read
jean
with
a
soft
laugh
like
a
handsome
youth
who
already
has
thoughts
of
women
that
a
pretty
name
that
must
draw
customers
eh
but
denise
was
absorbed
by
the
display
at
the
principal
entrance
there
in
the
open
street
on
the
very
pavement
she
beheld
a
mass
of
cheap
goods
doorway
temptations
bargains
to
attract
the
pieces
of
woollen
and
cloth
goods
merinoes
cheviots
and
tweeds
hung
from
above
like
bunting
with
their
neutral
slate
and
tints
relieved
by
large
white
close
by
on
either
side
of
the
doorway
dangled
strips
of
fur
narrow
bands
for
dress
trimmings
siberian
swansdown
of
spotless
snowiness
and
transformed
into
imitation
ermine
and
imitation
sable
below
in
boxes
and
on
tables
amidst
piles
of
remnants
appeared
a
quantity
of
hosiery
which
was
virtually
given
away
knitted
woollen
gloves
neckerchiefs
women
hoods
cardigan
waistcoats
a
complete
winter
show
with
colours
in
mixtures
patterns
and
stripes
and
here
and
there
a
flaming
patch
of
red
denise
saw
some
tartan
at
nine
sous
some
strips
of
american
bison
at
a
franc
the
mètre
and
some
mittens
at
five
sous
a
pair
an
immense
clearance
sale
was
apparently
going
on
the
establishment
seemed
to
be
bursting
with
goods
blocking
up
the
pavement
with
the
surplus
of
its
contents
uncle
baudu
was
forgotten
even
pépé
clinging
tightly
to
his
sister
hand
opened
his
big
eyes
in
wonder
however
a
vehicle
in
coming
up
forced
them
to
quit
the
roadway
and
they
mechanically
turned
into
the
rue
following
the
windows
and
stopping
at
each
fresh
display
at
first
they
were
captivated
by
an
intricate
arrangement
up
above
a
number
of
umbrellas
placed
obliquely
seemed
to
form
a
rustic
roof
upon
rods
beneath
them
hung
a
quantity
of
silk
stockings
displaying
neat
ankles
and
well
rounded
calves
some
of
them
dotted
with
rosebuds
others
of
divers
hues
the
black
ones
and
the
red
ones
elegantly
clocked
whilst
those
which
were
of
a
flesh
tint
looked
with
their
satiny
texture
as
soft
as
skin
itself
then
on
the
baize
covering
of
the
came
a
symmetrical
array
of
gloves
with
extended
fingers
and
narrow
palms
recalling
the
hands
of
byzantine
virgins
all
the
rigid
and
as
it
were
adolescent
grace
which
characterises
feminine
frippery
before
it
is
worn
however
it
was
especially
the
last
window
which
detained
their
eyes
an
exhibition
of
silks
satins
and
velvets
in
a
supple
vibrating
scale
of
colour
here
set
as
in
full
bloom
the
most
delicate
hues
of
the
floral
world
at
the
top
were
the
velvets
deeply
black
or
white
as
curds
lower
down
came
the
satins
pinks
and
blues
bright
at
their
folds
then
fading
into
paler
and
paler
tints
of
infinite
delicacy
and
lower
still
were
silks
the
rainbow
variegated
scarf
the
several
pieces
cocked
plaited
as
though
round
some
female
waist
endowed
as
it
were
with
life
by
the
skilful
manipulation
of
the
employees
and
between
each
each
glowing
phrase
of
the
display
ran
a
discreet
accompaniment
a
light
puffy
roll
of
creamy
here
too
at
either
end
of
the
window
were
huge
piles
of
the
two
silks
which
were
the
exclusive
property
of
the
establishment
the
paris
delight
and
the
golden
grain
articles
of
exceptional
quality
destined
to
revolutionize
the
silk
trade
oh
look
at
that
at
five
francs
sixty
murmured
denise
transported
with
astonishment
at
sight
of
the
paris
delight
jean
however
was
getting
bored
and
stopped
a
which
is
the
rue
de
la
michodière
please
sir
on
hearing
that
it
was
the
first
on
the
right
they
all
turned
back
making
the
tour
of
the
establishment
but
just
as
she
was
entering
the
street
denise
was
again
attracted
by
a
window
in
which
ladies
mantles
were
displayed
at
cornaille
the
mantles
had
been
her
department
but
she
had
never
seen
anything
like
this
and
remained
rooted
to
the
spot
with
admiration
at
the
rear
a
large
scarf
of
bruges
lace
of
considerable
value
was
spread
out
like
an
with
its
two
creamy
wings
extended
then
there
were
flounces
of
alençon
grouped
in
garlands
and
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
like
falling
snow
fluttered
lace
of
every
description
malines
valenciennes
brussels
and
on
each
side
pieces
of
cloth
rose
up
in
dark
columns
imparting
distance
to
the
background
and
the
mantles
were
here
in
this
sort
of
chapel
raised
to
the
worship
of
woman
beauty
and
grace
in
the
centre
was
a
magnificent
article
a
velvet
mantle
trimmed
with
silver
fox
on
one
side
of
it
appeared
a
silk
cloak
lined
with
miniver
on
the
other
a
cloth
cloak
edged
with
cocks
plumes
and
last
of
all
some
opera
cloaks
in
white
cashmere
and
quilted
silk
trimmed
with
swansdown
or
chenille
there
was
something
for
every
taste
from
the
opera
cloaks
at
francs
to
the
velvet
mantle
which
was
marked
eighteen
hundred
the
round
busts
of
the
dummies
filled
out
the
stuff
the
prominent
hips
exaggerating
the
slimness
of
the
waists
and
the
absent
heads
being
replaced
by
large
pinned
on
the
necks
whilst
the
mirrors
on
each
side
of
the
window
reflected
and
multiplied
all
these
forms
peopling
the
street
as
it
were
with
beautiful
women
for
sale
each
bearing
a
price
in
big
figures
in
lieu
of
a
head
how
stunning
they
are
murmured
jean
finding
no
other
words
to
express
his
emotion
this
time
he
himself
had
become
motionless
and
stood
there
gaping
all
this
female
luxury
turned
him
rosy
with
pleasure
he
had
a
beauty
a
beauty
which
he
seemed
to
have
stolen
from
his
sister
a
fair
white
skin
ruddy
curly
hair
lips
and
eyes
overflowing
with
tenderness
by
his
side
denise
with
her
rather
long
face
large
mouth
fading
complexion
and
light
hair
appeared
thinner
still
pépé
who
was
also
fair
with
the
fairness
of
infancy
now
clung
closer
to
her
as
if
anxious
to
be
caressed
perturbed
and
delighted
as
he
was
by
the
sight
of
the
beautiful
ladies
in
the
window
and
those
three
fair
ones
poorly
clad
in
black
that
girl
between
the
pretty
child
and
the
handsome
youth
looked
so
strange
yet
so
charming
standing
there
on
the
pavement
that
the
glanced
back
smilingly
for
some
minutes
a
stout
man
with
grey
hair
and
a
large
yellow
face
had
been
looking
at
them
from
a
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
he
had
been
standing
there
with
bloodshot
eyes
and
contracted
mouth
beside
himself
with
rage
at
the
display
made
by
the
paradise
when
the
sight
of
the
girl
and
her
brothers
had
completed
his
exasperation
what
were
those
three
simpletons
doing
there
gaping
in
front
of
the
show
booth
what
about
uncle
asked
denise
suddenly
as
if
just
waking
up
we
are
in
the
rue
de
la
michodière
replied
jean
he
must
live
somewhere
about
here
they
raised
their
heads
and
looked
round
and
just
in
front
of
them
above
the
stout
man
they
perceived
a
green
on
which
in
yellow
letters
discoloured
by
the
rain
was
the
following
inscription
the
old
elbeuf
cloths
and
flannels
baudu
late
hauchecorne
the
house
coated
with
ancient
rusty
paint
and
quite
flat
and
unadorned
amidst
the
surrounding
mansions
of
the
louis
xiv
period
had
only
three
front
windows
up
above
square
and
shutterless
windows
simply
provided
with
handrails
supported
by
two
iron
bars
placed
crosswise
but
what
most
struck
denise
whose
eyes
were
full
of
the
bright
display
of
the
ladies
paradise
was
the
low
shop
surmounted
by
an
equally
low
storey
with
windows
of
appearance
right
and
left
framed
round
by
wood
work
of
a
hue
which
time
had
tinted
with
ochre
and
bitumen
were
two
deep
windows
black
and
dusty
in
which
pieces
of
cloth
heaped
one
on
another
could
vaguely
be
seen
the
open
doorway
seemed
to
conduct
into
the
darkness
and
dampness
of
a
cellar
that
the
house
said
jean
well
we
must
go
in
declared
denise
come
on
pépé
all
three
however
grew
somewhat
troubled
as
if
seized
with
fear
when
their
father
had
died
carried
off
by
the
same
fever
which
a
month
previously
had
killed
their
mother
their
uncle
baudu
in
the
emotion
born
of
this
double
bereavement
had
certainly
written
to
denise
assuring
her
that
there
would
always
be
a
place
for
her
in
his
house
whenever
she
might
like
to
try
fortune
in
paris
but
this
had
taken
place
nearly
a
year
ago
and
the
young
girl
was
now
sorry
that
she
should
have
so
impulsively
left
valognes
without
informing
her
uncle
the
latter
did
not
know
them
never
having
set
foot
in
the
little
town
since
the
day
when
he
had
left
it
as
a
boy
to
enter
the
service
of
the
draper
hauchecorne
whose
daughter
he
had
subsequently
married
monsieur
baudu
asked
denise
at
last
making
up
her
mind
to
speak
to
the
stout
man
who
was
still
eyeing
them
surprised
by
their
appearance
and
manners
that
me
he
replied
then
denise
blushed
deeply
and
stammered
oh
i
so
pleased
i
am
denise
this
is
jean
and
this
is
pépé
you
see
we
have
come
uncle
baudu
seemed
lost
in
amazement
his
big
eyes
rolled
in
his
yellow
face
he
spoke
slowly
and
with
difficulty
he
had
evidently
been
far
from
thinking
of
this
family
which
now
suddenly
dropped
down
upon
him
what
what
you
here
he
several
times
repeated
but
you
were
at
valognes
why
are
you
at
valognes
in
her
sweet
but
rather
faltering
voice
she
then
explained
that
since
the
death
of
her
father
who
had
spent
every
penny
he
possessed
in
his
she
had
acted
as
a
mother
to
the
two
children
but
the
little
she
had
earned
at
cornaille
did
not
suffice
to
keep
the
three
of
them
jean
certainly
worked
at
a
a
repairer
of
old
furniture
but
did
earn
a
sou
still
he
had
got
to
like
the
business
and
had
even
learned
to
carve
one
day
having
found
a
piece
of
ivory
he
had
amused
himself
by
carving
it
into
a
head
which
a
gentleman
staying
in
the
town
had
seen
and
praised
and
this
gentleman
it
was
who
had
been
the
cause
of
their
leaving
valognes
as
he
had
found
jean
a
place
with
an
in
paris
so
you
see
uncle
continued
denise
jean
will
commence
his
apprenticeship
at
his
new
master
they
ask
no
premium
and
will
board
and
lodge
him
and
so
i
felt
sure
that
pépé
and
i
would
be
able
to
jog
along
at
all
events
we
ca
be
worse
off
than
we
were
at
valognes
she
said
nothing
about
a
certain
love
affair
of
jean
of
certain
letters
which
he
had
written
to
the
daughter
of
a
nobleman
of
the
town
of
the
kisses
which
the
pair
had
exchanged
over
a
wall
in
fact
quite
a
scandal
which
had
strengthened
her
in
her
determination
to
leave
and
if
she
was
so
anxious
to
be
in
paris
herself
it
was
that
she
might
be
able
to
look
after
her
brother
feeling
as
she
did
quite
a
tender
anxiety
for
this
gay
and
handsome
youth
whom
all
the
women
adored
uncle
baudu
however
could
get
over
it
but
continued
his
questions
so
your
father
left
you
nothing
said
he
i
certainly
thought
there
was
still
something
left
ah
how
many
times
did
i
write
advising
him
not
to
take
those
he
was
a
fellow
certainly
but
he
had
no
head
for
business
and
you
were
left
with
those
two
youngsters
to
look
after
you
had
to
keep
them
eh
his
bilious
face
had
now
become
clearer
his
eyes
were
not
so
bloodshot
as
when
he
had
stood
glaring
at
the
ladies
paradise
all
at
once
he
noticed
that
he
was
blocking
up
the
doorway
well
said
he
come
in
now
you
here
come
in
that
be
better
than
gaping
at
a
parcel
of
rubbish
and
after
addressing
a
last
pout
of
anger
to
the
ladies
paradise
he
made
way
for
the
children
by
entering
the
shop
and
calling
his
wife
and
daughter
elizabeth
geneviève
come
down
here
company
for
you
denise
and
the
two
boys
however
hesitated
at
sight
of
the
darkness
of
the
shop
blinded
by
the
clear
outdoor
light
they
blinked
as
on
the
threshold
of
some
unknown
pit
and
felt
their
way
with
their
feet
with
an
instinctive
fear
of
encountering
some
treacherous
step
and
drawn
yet
closer
together
by
this
vague
fear
the
child
still
holding
the
girl
skirts
and
the
big
boy
behind
they
made
their
entry
with
a
smiling
anxious
grace
the
clear
morning
light
outlined
the
dark
silhouettes
of
their
mourning
clothes
and
an
oblique
ray
of
sunshine
gilded
their
fair
hair
come
in
come
in
repeated
baudu
then
in
a
few
sentences
he
explained
matters
to
his
wife
and
daughter
the
former
was
a
little
woman
consumed
by
anæmia
and
quite
white
white
hair
white
eyes
and
white
lips
geneviève
the
daughter
in
whom
the
maternal
degeneracy
appeared
yet
more
marked
had
the
sickly
colourless
appearance
of
a
plant
reared
in
the
shade
however
a
thick
heavy
crop
of
magnificent
black
hair
marvellously
vigorous
for
such
poor
soil
gave
her
as
it
were
a
mournful
charm
come
in
said
both
the
women
in
their
turn
you
are
welcome
and
they
at
once
made
denise
sit
down
behind
a
counter
pépé
then
jumped
upon
his
sister
lap
whilst
jean
leant
against
the
panelling
beside
her
they
were
regaining
their
assurance
and
looking
round
the
shop
where
their
eyes
had
grown
used
to
the
obscurity
they
could
now
distinctly
see
it
all
with
its
low
and
smoky
ceiling
its
oaken
counters
polished
by
use
and
its
nests
of
drawers
with
strong
iron
fittings
bales
of
dark
goods
reached
to
the
beams
above
a
smell
of
wool
and
dye
a
sharp
chemical
smell
prevailed
intensified
it
seemed
by
the
humidity
of
the
floor
at
the
further
end
two
young
men
and
a
young
woman
were
putting
away
some
pieces
of
white
flannel
perhaps
this
young
gentleman
would
like
to
take
something
said
madame
baudu
smiling
at
pépé
no
thanks
replied
denise
we
each
had
a
cup
of
milk
at
a
café
opposite
the
station
and
as
geneviève
looked
at
the
small
parcel
she
had
laid
on
the
floor
near
her
she
added
i
left
our
box
there
too
she
blushed
as
she
spoke
feeling
that
she
ought
not
to
have
dropped
down
on
her
friends
in
this
way
even
in
the
train
just
as
she
was
leaving
valognes
she
had
been
assailed
by
regrets
and
fears
and
this
was
why
she
had
left
the
box
at
the
station
and
given
the
children
their
breakfast
immediately
on
arriving
in
paris
well
well
suddenly
said
baudu
let
come
to
an
understanding
is
true
that
i
wrote
to
you
but
that
was
a
year
ago
and
since
then
business
has
been
flourishing
i
can
assure
you
my
girl
he
stopped
short
choked
by
an
emotion
he
did
not
wish
to
show
madame
baudu
and
geneviève
had
cast
down
their
eyes
with
an
air
of
resignation
oh
continued
he
it
a
crisis
which
will
pass
no
doubt
i
not
uneasy
but
i
have
reduced
my
staff
there
are
only
three
here
now
and
this
is
not
the
moment
to
engage
a
fourth
in
short
my
poor
girl
i
can
not
take
you
as
i
promised
denise
listened
aghast
and
very
pale
he
repeated
his
words
adding
it
would
do
no
good
to
either
of
us
all
right
uncle
at
last
she
replied
with
a
painful
effort
try
to
manage
all
the
same
the
baudus
were
not
bad
sort
of
people
but
they
complained
of
never
having
had
any
luck
in
the
flourishing
days
of
their
business
they
had
had
to
bring
up
five
sons
of
whom
three
had
died
before
attaining
the
age
of
twenty
the
fourth
had
gone
wrong
and
the
fifth
had
just
started
for
mexico
as
a
captain
geneviève
was
the
only
one
now
left
at
home
from
first
to
last
however
this
large
family
had
cost
a
deal
of
money
and
baudu
had
made
things
worse
by
buying
a
great
lumbering
country
house
at
rambouillet
near
his
wife
father
place
thus
a
sharp
sour
feeling
was
springing
up
in
the
honest
old
breast
you
might
have
warned
us
he
resumed
gradually
getting
angry
at
his
own
harshness
you
might
have
written
and
i
should
have
told
you
to
stay
at
valognes
when
i
heard
of
your
father
death
i
said
what
is
right
on
such
occasions
but
you
drop
down
on
us
without
a
word
of
warning
it
very
awkward
he
raised
his
voice
as
he
thus
relieved
himself
his
wife
and
daughter
still
kept
their
eyes
on
the
floor
like
submissive
persons
who
would
never
think
of
interfering
jean
however
had
turned
pale
whilst
denise
hugged
the
terrified
pépé
to
her
bosom
hot
tears
of
disappointment
fell
from
her
eyes
all
right
uncle
she
said
we
go
away
at
that
he
ceased
speaking
and
an
awkward
silence
ensued
then
he
resumed
in
a
surly
tone
i
do
mean
to
turn
you
out
as
you
are
here
you
can
sleep
upstairs
after
that
we
see
then
as
he
glanced
at
them
madame
baudu
and
geneviève
understood
that
they
were
free
to
arrange
matters
and
all
was
soon
settled
there
was
no
need
to
trouble
about
jean
as
he
was
to
enter
on
his
apprenticeship
the
next
day
as
for
pépé
he
would
be
well
looked
after
by
madame
gras
an
old
lady
who
rented
a
large
ground
floor
in
the
rue
des
orties
where
she
boarded
and
lodged
young
children
for
forty
francs
a
month
denise
said
that
she
had
sufficient
to
pay
for
the
first
month
and
so
the
only
remaining
question
was
to
find
a
place
for
herself
surely
they
would
be
able
to
discover
some
situation
for
her
in
the
neighbourhood
was
vinçard
in
want
of
a
saleswoman
asked
geneviève
of
course
so
he
was
cried
baudu
we
go
and
see
him
after
lunch
there
nothing
like
striking
the
iron
while
it
hot
not
a
customer
had
come
in
to
interrupt
this
family
discussion
the
shop
remained
dark
and
empty
as
before
at
the
far
end
the
two
young
men
and
the
young
woman
were
still
working
talking
in
low
sibilant
whispers
amongst
themselves
at
last
however
three
ladies
arrived
and
denise
was
then
left
alone
for
a
moment
she
kissed
pépé
with
a
swelling
heart
at
the
thought
of
their
approaching
separation
the
child
affectionate
as
a
kitten
hid
his
little
head
without
saying
a
word
when
madame
baudu
and
geneviève
returned
they
remarked
how
quiet
he
was
and
denise
assured
them
that
he
never
made
any
more
noise
than
that
but
remained
for
days
together
without
speaking
living
solely
on
kisses
and
caresses
then
until
the
three
women
sat
and
talked
together
about
children
housekeeping
life
in
paris
and
life
in
the
country
in
curt
cautious
sentences
like
relations
whom
ignorance
of
one
another
renders
somewhat
awkward
jean
meantime
had
gone
to
the
and
stood
there
watching
all
the
outdoor
life
and
smiling
at
the
pretty
girls
at
ten
a
servant
appeared
as
a
rule
the
cloth
was
then
laid
for
baudu
geneviève
and
the
a
second
lunch
being
served
at
eleven
for
madame
baudu
the
other
young
man
and
the
young
woman
come
to
lunch
exclaimed
the
draper
turning
towards
his
niece
and
when
they
sat
ready
in
the
narrow
behind
the
shop
he
called
the
who
had
lingered
behind
colomban
lunch
the
young
man
entered
apologising
he
had
wished
to
finish
arranging
the
flannels
he
said
he
was
a
big
fellow
of
heavy
but
crafty
for
although
his
face
with
its
large
weak
mouth
seemed
at
first
sight
typical
of
honesty
there
was
a
veiled
cunning
in
his
eyes
there
a
time
for
everything
rejoined
baudu
who
sat
before
a
piece
of
cold
veal
carving
it
with
a
master
skill
and
prudence
calculating
the
weight
of
each
thin
slice
to
within
a
quarter
of
an
ounce
he
served
everybody
and
even
cut
up
the
bread
denise
had
placed
pépé
near
her
to
see
that
he
ate
properly
but
the
dark
close
room
made
her
feel
uncomfortable
she
thought
it
so
small
after
the
large
rooms
to
which
she
had
been
accustomed
in
the
country
a
single
window
overlooked
a
small
which
communicated
with
the
street
by
a
dark
passage
running
along
the
side
of
the
house
and
this
yard
dripping
wet
and
was
like
the
bottom
of
some
well
into
which
fell
a
circular
glimmer
of
light
in
the
winter
they
were
obliged
to
keep
the
gas
burning
all
day
and
when
the
weather
enabled
them
to
do
without
it
the
room
seemed
more
melancholy
still
several
seconds
elapsed
before
denise
eyes
got
sufficiently
used
to
the
light
to
distinguish
the
food
on
her
plate
that
young
chap
has
a
good
appetite
remarked
baudu
observing
that
jean
had
finished
his
veal
if
he
works
as
well
as
he
eats
he
make
a
fine
fellow
but
you
my
girl
you
are
not
eating
and
i
say
now
that
we
can
talk
a
bit
tell
us
why
you
did
get
married
at
valognes
at
this
denise
almost
dropped
the
glass
she
held
in
her
hand
oh
uncle
get
married
how
can
you
think
of
it
and
the
little
ones
she
ended
by
laughing
it
seemed
to
her
such
a
strange
idea
besides
what
man
would
have
cared
to
take
her
a
girl
without
a
sou
no
fatter
than
a
lath
and
not
at
all
pretty
no
no
she
would
never
marry
she
had
quite
enough
children
with
her
two
brothers
you
are
wrong
said
her
uncle
a
woman
always
needs
a
man
if
you
had
found
an
honest
young
fellow
over
there
you
would
have
dropped
on
to
the
paris
pavement
you
and
your
brothers
like
a
party
of
gipsies
he
paused
in
order
to
apportion
with
a
parsimony
full
of
justice
a
dish
of
bacon
and
potatoes
which
the
servant
had
just
brought
in
then
pointing
to
geneviève
and
colomban
with
his
spoon
he
added
those
two
will
get
married
next
spring
if
we
have
a
good
winter
season
such
was
the
patriarchal
custom
of
the
house
the
founder
aristide
finet
had
given
his
daughter
désirée
to
his
hauchecorne
he
baudu
who
had
arrived
in
the
rue
de
la
michodière
with
seven
francs
in
his
pocket
had
married
old
hauchecorne
daughter
elizabeth
and
in
his
turn
he
intended
to
hand
over
geneviève
and
the
business
to
colomban
as
soon
as
trade
should
improve
if
he
still
delayed
the
marriage
which
had
been
decided
on
three
years
previously
it
was
because
a
scruple
had
come
to
him
a
fixed
resolve
to
act
in
all
honesty
he
himself
had
received
the
business
in
a
prosperous
state
and
did
not
wish
to
pass
it
on
to
his
with
fewer
customers
or
doubtful
sales
and
continuing
his
talk
he
formally
introduced
colomban
who
came
from
rambouillet
like
madame
baudu
father
in
fact
they
were
distant
cousins
a
fellow
was
colomban
said
he
for
ten
years
he
had
slaved
in
the
shop
fairly
earning
all
his
promotions
besides
he
was
far
from
being
a
nobody
his
father
was
that
noted
toper
colomban
the
veterinary
surgeon
so
well
known
all
over
the
department
of
an
artist
in
his
line
but
so
addicted
to
the
flowing
bowl
that
his
money
fast
slipped
through
his
fingers
thank
heaven
said
the
draper
in
conclusion
if
the
father
drinks
and
runs
after
women
the
son
at
all
events
has
learnt
the
value
of
money
here
whilst
he
was
thus
speaking
denise
began
to
examine
geneviève
and
colomban
though
they
sat
close
together
at
table
they
remained
very
quiet
without
a
blush
or
a
smile
from
the
day
of
entering
the
establishment
the
young
man
had
counted
on
this
marriage
he
had
passed
through
the
various
stages
of
junior
hand
salesman
at
last
gaining
admittance
into
the
confidence
and
pleasures
of
the
family
circle
and
all
this
patiently
whilst
leading
a
style
of
life
and
looking
upon
his
marriage
with
geneviève
as
a
legitimate
stroke
of
business
the
certainty
of
having
her
as
his
wife
prevented
him
from
feeling
any
desire
for
her
on
her
side
the
girl
had
got
to
love
him
with
the
gravity
of
her
reserved
nature
full
of
a
real
deep
passion
of
which
she
was
not
aware
in
the
regulated
monotony
of
her
daily
life
oh
it
quite
right
when
folks
like
each
other
and
can
do
it
at
last
said
denise
smiling
with
a
view
to
making
herself
agreeable
yes
it
always
finishes
like
that
declared
colomban
who
slowly
masticating
had
not
yet
spoken
a
word
geneviève
gave
him
a
long
look
and
then
in
her
turn
remarked
when
people
understand
each
other
the
rest
comes
naturally
their
affection
had
sprung
up
in
this
gloomy
nook
of
old
paris
like
a
flower
in
a
cellar
for
ten
years
past
she
had
known
no
one
but
him
living
by
his
side
behind
the
same
bales
of
cloth
amidst
the
darkness
of
the
shop
and
morning
and
evening
they
had
found
themselves
elbow
to
elbow
in
the
tiny
so
damp
and
they
could
not
have
been
more
concealed
more
utterly
lost
had
they
been
far
away
in
the
country
under
the
screening
foliage
of
the
trees
only
the
advent
of
doubt
of
jealous
fear
could
make
it
plain
to
the
girl
that
she
had
given
herself
for
ever
amidst
this
abetting
solitude
through
sheer
emptiness
of
heart
and
mental
weariness
as
it
was
denise
fancied
she
could
detect
a
growing
anxiety
in
the
look
geneviève
had
cast
at
colomban
so
she
replied
oh
when
people
are
in
love
they
always
understand
each
other
meantime
baudu
kept
a
sharp
eye
on
the
table
he
had
distributed
some
fingers
of
brie
cheese
and
as
a
treat
for
the
visitors
called
for
a
second
dessert
a
pot
of
jam
a
liberality
which
seemed
to
surprise
colomban
pépé
who
so
far
had
been
very
good
behaved
rather
badly
at
the
sight
of
the
jam
whilst
jean
his
attention
attracted
by
the
conversation
about
his
cousin
geneviève
marriage
began
to
take
stock
of
the
girl
whom
he
thought
too
puny
and
too
pale
comparing
her
in
his
own
mind
to
a
little
white
rabbit
with
black
ears
and
pink
eyes
well
we
chatted
enough
and
must
make
room
for
the
others
said
the
draper
giving
the
signal
to
rise
from
table
just
because
had
a
treat
there
is
no
reason
why
we
should
want
too
much
of
it
madame
baudu
the
other
shopman
and
the
young
lady
then
came
and
took
their
places
at
table
denise
again
left
to
herself
sat
down
near
the
door
waiting
until
her
uncle
should
be
able
to
take
her
to
vinçard
pépé
was
playing
at
her
feet
whilst
jean
had
resumed
his
post
of
observation
on
the
threshold
and
denise
sat
there
for
nearly
an
hour
taking
interest
in
what
went
on
around
her
now
and
again
a
few
customers
came
in
a
lady
then
two
others
appeared
the
shop
meanwhile
retaining
its
musty
odour
and
its
half
light
in
which
commerce
simple
and
good
natured
seemed
to
weep
at
finding
itself
so
deserted
what
most
interested
denise
however
was
the
ladies
paradise
opposite
whose
windows
she
could
see
through
the
open
doorway
the
sky
remained
cloudy
a
sort
of
humid
mildness
warmed
the
air
notwithstanding
the
season
and
in
the
clear
light
permeated
as
it
were
by
a
hazy
diffusion
of
sunshine
the
great
shop
acquired
abundant
life
and
activity
to
denise
it
seemed
as
if
she
were
watching
a
machine
working
at
full
pressure
setting
even
the
in
motion
they
were
no
longer
the
cold
windows
she
had
seen
in
the
early
morning
they
seemed
to
have
been
warmed
and
to
vibrate
with
all
the
activity
within
there
were
folks
before
them
groups
of
women
pushing
and
squeezing
against
the
sheets
of
glass
a
perfect
crowd
excited
with
covetousness
and
in
this
passionate
atmosphere
the
stuffs
themselves
seemed
endowed
with
life
the
laces
quivered
drooped
and
concealed
the
depths
of
the
shop
with
a
disturbing
air
of
mystery
even
the
thick
lengths
of
cloth
breathed
exhaling
a
tempting
odour
while
the
coats
seemed
to
draw
themselves
up
more
erectly
on
the
dummies
which
acquired
souls
and
the
velvet
mantle
expanded
supple
and
warm
as
if
falling
from
real
shoulders
over
a
heaving
bosom
and
quivering
hips
but
the
glow
which
pervaded
the
house
came
above
all
from
the
sales
the
crush
at
the
counters
which
could
be
divined
behind
the
walls
there
was
the
continual
roaring
of
a
machine
at
work
an
engulfing
of
customers
against
the
counters
bewildered
amidst
the
piles
of
goods
and
finally
hurled
towards
the
and
all
went
on
in
an
orderly
manner
with
mechanical
regularity
force
and
logic
carrying
quite
a
nation
of
women
through
the
gearing
of
this
commercial
machine
denise
had
felt
tempted
ever
since
early
morning
she
was
bewildered
and
attracted
by
this
shop
to
her
so
vast
which
she
saw
more
people
enter
in
an
hour
than
she
had
seen
enter
cornaille
in
six
months
and
with
her
desire
to
enter
it
was
mingled
a
vague
sense
of
danger
which
rendered
her
seduction
complete
at
the
same
time
her
uncle
shop
made
her
feel
ill
at
ease
she
felt
unreasonable
disdain
instinctive
repugnance
for
this
cold
icy
place
the
home
of
trading
all
her
sensations
her
anxious
entry
her
relatives
cold
reception
the
dull
lunch
partaken
of
in
a
atmosphere
her
spell
of
waiting
amidst
the
sleepy
solitude
of
this
old
establishment
doomed
to
speedy
decay
all
these
became
concentrated
in
mute
protest
in
a
passionate
longing
for
life
and
light
and
despite
her
good
heart
her
eyes
ceaselessly
turned
to
the
ladies
paradise
as
if
saleswoman
as
she
was
she
felt
the
need
of
warming
herself
in
the
glow
of
that
immense
business
plenty
of
customers
over
there
at
all
events
was
the
remark
which
at
last
escaped
her
but
she
promptly
regretted
these
words
on
seeing
the
baudus
near
her
madame
baudu
who
had
finished
her
lunch
was
standing
there
quite
white
with
her
pale
eyes
fixed
on
the
monster
and
resigned
though
she
tried
to
be
she
could
never
catch
sight
of
that
place
across
the
road
without
mute
despair
filling
her
eyes
with
tears
as
for
geneviève
she
was
anxiously
watching
colomban
who
unaware
that
he
was
being
observed
remained
in
ecstasy
looking
at
the
young
saleswomen
in
the
mantle
department
of
the
paradise
whose
counter
was
visible
through
the
first
floor
window
baudu
for
his
part
though
his
anger
was
written
on
his
face
merely
remarked
all
is
not
gold
that
glitters
patience
the
members
of
the
family
evidently
kept
back
the
flood
of
rancour
rising
in
their
throats
a
feeling
of
prevented
them
from
displaying
their
temper
before
these
children
who
had
only
that
morning
arrived
at
last
the
draper
made
an
effort
and
tore
himself
away
from
the
spectacle
of
the
paradise
and
its
sales
well
he
resumed
we
go
and
see
vinçard
situations
are
soon
snatched
up
and
it
might
be
too
late
however
before
starting
he
ordered
his
junior
salesman
to
go
to
the
railway
station
to
fetch
denise
box
on
her
side
madame
baudu
to
whom
the
girl
had
confided
pépé
decided
to
run
over
to
see
madame
gras
in
order
to
arrange
about
the
child
jean
on
the
other
hand
promised
his
sister
not
to
stir
from
the
shop
it
two
minutes
walk
explained
baudu
as
he
went
down
the
rue
gaillon
with
his
niece
vinçard
has
a
silk
business
and
still
does
a
fair
trade
oh
of
course
he
has
his
worries
like
every
one
else
but
he
an
artful
fellow
who
makes
both
ends
meet
by
his
miserly
ways
i
fancy
though
he
wants
to
retire
on
account
of
his
rheumatics
vinçard
shop
was
in
the
rue
near
the
passage
choiseul
it
was
clean
and
light
well
fitted
up
in
the
modern
style
but
rather
small
and
contained
but
a
poor
stock
baudu
and
denise
found
vinçard
in
consultation
with
two
gentlemen
never
mind
us
called
out
the
draper
we
are
in
no
hurry
we
can
wait
and
discreetly
returning
to
the
door
he
whispered
to
denise
that
thin
fellow
is
second
in
the
silk
department
at
the
paradise
and
the
stout
man
is
a
silk
manufacturer
from
lyons
denise
gathered
that
vinçard
was
trying
to
sell
his
business
to
robineau
of
the
paradise
with
a
frank
air
and
open
face
he
was
giving
his
word
of
honour
with
the
facility
of
a
man
whom
assurances
never
troubled
according
to
him
his
business
was
a
golden
one
and
albeit
in
the
splendour
of
robust
health
he
broke
off
to
whine
and
complain
of
those
infernal
pains
of
his
which
prevented
him
from
remaining
in
business
and
making
his
fortune
robineau
who
seemed
nervous
and
uneasy
interrupted
him
impatiently
he
knew
what
a
crisis
the
trade
was
passing
through
and
named
a
silk
warehouse
which
had
already
been
ruined
by
the
vicinity
of
the
paradise
then
vinçard
inflamed
raised
his
voice
no
wonder
the
downfall
of
that
big
booby
vabre
was
a
foregone
conclusion
his
wife
spent
everything
he
earned
besides
we
are
more
than
five
hundred
yards
away
whilst
vabre
was
almost
next
door
to
the
paradise
gaujean
the
silk
manufacturer
then
chimed
in
and
their
voices
fell
again
he
accused
the
big
establishments
of
ruining
french
manufactures
three
or
four
laid
down
the
law
reigning
like
masters
over
the
market
and
he
gave
it
as
his
opinion
that
the
only
way
to
fight
them
was
to
favour
the
small
traders
above
all
those
who
dealt
in
specialties
for
to
them
the
future
belonged
for
that
reason
he
offered
robineau
plenty
of
credit
see
how
you
have
been
treated
at
the
paradise
said
he
no
notice
has
been
taken
of
your
long
service
you
had
the
promise
of
the
place
long
ago
when
bouthemont
an
outsider
without
any
claim
at
all
came
in
and
got
it
at
once
robineau
was
still
smarting
under
this
act
of
injustice
however
he
hesitated
to
start
business
on
his
own
account
explaining
that
the
money
came
from
his
wife
who
had
inherited
sixty
thousand
francs
and
he
was
full
of
scruples
regarding
this
money
saying
that
he
would
rather
cut
off
his
right
hand
than
compromise
it
in
a
doubtful
affair
no
said
he
i
have
yet
made
up
my
mind
give
me
time
to
think
over
it
we
have
another
talk
about
it
as
you
like
replied
vinçard
concealing
his
disappointment
under
a
smiling
countenance
my
interest
you
know
is
not
to
sell
and
i
certainly
should
were
it
not
for
my
rheumatics
then
stepping
to
the
middle
of
the
shop
he
inquired
what
can
i
do
for
you
monsieur
baudu
the
draper
who
had
been
slily
listening
thereupon
introduced
denise
telling
vinçard
as
much
as
he
thought
necessary
of
her
story
and
adding
that
she
had
two
years
country
experience
and
as
i
heard
you
are
wanting
a
good
saleswoman
he
added
but
vinçard
affecting
extreme
sorrow
cut
him
short
how
unfortunate
said
he
i
had
indeed
been
looking
for
a
saleswoman
all
this
week
but
i
just
engaged
one
not
two
hours
ago
a
silence
ensued
denise
seemed
to
be
in
consternation
robineau
who
was
looking
at
her
with
interest
probably
inspired
with
pity
by
her
appearance
ventured
to
remark
i
know
wanting
a
young
person
at
our
place
in
the
mantle
department
at
this
baudu
could
not
restrain
a
fervent
outburst
at
your
place
indeed
never
then
he
stopped
short
in
embarrassment
denise
had
turned
very
red
she
would
never
dare
to
enter
that
great
shop
and
yet
the
idea
of
belonging
to
it
filled
her
with
pride
why
not
asked
robineau
surprised
it
would
be
a
good
opening
for
the
young
lady
i
advise
her
to
go
and
see
madame
aurélie
the
the
worst
that
can
happen
to
her
is
to
be
refused
the
draper
to
conceal
his
inward
revolt
then
began
talking
vaguely
he
knew
madame
aurélie
or
at
least
her
husband
lhomme
the
cashier
a
stout
man
who
had
had
his
right
arm
crushed
by
an
omnibus
then
suddenly
turning
to
denise
he
added
however
it
her
business
it
is
mine
she
can
do
as
she
likes
and
thereupon
he
went
off
after
wishing
gaujean
and
robineau
vinçard
accompanied
him
as
far
as
the
door
reiterating
his
regrets
the
girl
meantime
had
remained
in
the
middle
of
the
shop
intimidated
yet
desirous
of
asking
robineau
for
further
particulars
however
she
could
not
muster
the
courage
to
do
so
but
in
her
turn
bowed
and
simply
said
thank
you
sir
on
the
way
back
baudu
said
nothing
to
his
niece
but
as
if
carried
away
by
his
reflections
walked
on
very
fast
forcing
her
to
run
in
order
to
keep
up
with
him
on
reaching
the
rue
de
la
michodière
he
was
about
to
enter
his
establishment
when
a
neighbouring
shopkeeper
standing
at
his
door
called
to
him
denise
stopped
and
waited
what
is
it
père
bourras
asked
the
draper
bourras
was
a
tall
old
man
with
a
prophet
head
bearded
and
hairy
with
piercing
eyes
shining
from
under
bushy
brows
he
kept
an
umbrella
and
shop
did
repairs
and
even
carved
handles
which
had
won
for
him
an
artistic
celebrity
in
the
neighbourhood
denise
glanced
at
the
windows
of
his
shop
where
the
sticks
and
umbrellas
were
arranged
in
straight
lines
but
on
raising
her
eyes
she
was
astonished
by
the
appearance
of
the
house
it
was
an
old
hovel
squeezed
in
between
the
ladies
paradise
and
a
large
louis
xiv
mansion
you
could
hardly
conceive
how
it
had
sprung
up
in
the
narrow
slit
where
its
two
low
dumpy
storeys
displayed
themselves
had
it
not
been
for
the
support
of
the
buildings
on
either
side
it
must
have
fallen
the
slates
of
its
roof
were
old
and
rotten
and
its
front
was
cracked
and
covered
with
stains
running
down
in
long
rusty
lines
to
the
over
the
shop
you
know
he
written
to
my
landlord
offering
to
buy
the
house
said
bourras
looking
steadily
at
the
draper
with
his
fiery
eyes
baudu
became
paler
still
and
bent
his
shoulders
there
was
a
silence
during
which
the
two
men
remained
face
to
face
looking
very
serious
we
must
be
prepared
for
anything
murmured
baudu
at
last
thereupon
bourras
flew
into
a
passion
shaking
his
hair
and
flowing
beard
while
he
shouted
let
him
buy
the
house
he
have
to
pay
four
times
the
value
for
it
but
i
swear
that
as
long
as
i
live
he
touch
a
stone
of
it
my
lease
has
twelve
years
to
run
yet
we
shall
see
we
shall
see
it
was
a
declaration
of
war
bourras
was
looking
towards
the
paradise
which
neither
of
them
had
named
for
a
moment
baudu
remained
shaking
his
head
in
silence
and
then
crossed
the
street
to
his
shop
his
legs
almost
failing
him
as
he
repeated
ah
good
lord
ah
good
lord
denise
who
had
listened
followed
her
uncle
madame
baudu
had
just
come
back
with
pépé
whom
madame
gras
had
agreed
to
receive
at
any
time
jean
however
had
disappeared
and
this
made
his
sister
anxious
when
he
returned
with
a
flushed
face
talking
in
an
animated
way
of
the
boulevards
she
looked
at
him
with
such
a
sad
expression
that
he
blushed
with
shame
meantime
their
box
had
arrived
and
it
was
arranged
that
they
should
sleep
in
the
attic
ah
by
the
way
how
did
you
get
on
at
vinçard
inquired
madame
baudu
the
draper
thereupon
gave
an
account
of
his
fruitless
errand
adding
that
denise
had
heard
of
a
situation
and
pointing
to
the
paradise
with
a
scornful
gesture
he
exclaimed
there
in
there
the
whole
family
felt
hurt
at
the
idea
the
first
dinner
was
at
five
denise
and
the
two
children
sat
down
to
it
with
baudu
geneviève
and
colomban
a
single
gas
jet
lighted
and
warmed
the
little
which
reeked
with
the
smell
of
food
the
meal
passed
off
in
silence
but
at
dessert
madame
baudu
who
was
restless
left
the
shop
and
came
and
sat
down
behind
denise
and
then
the
storm
kept
back
all
day
broke
out
one
and
all
seeking
to
relieve
their
feelings
by
abusing
the
monster
it
your
business
you
can
do
as
you
like
repeated
baudu
we
do
want
to
influence
you
but
if
you
only
knew
what
sort
of
place
it
is
and
in
broken
sentences
he
commenced
to
relate
the
story
of
that
octave
mouret
to
whom
the
paradise
belonged
he
had
been
wonderfully
lucky
a
fellow
who
had
come
up
from
the
south
of
france
with
the
smiling
audacity
of
an
adventurer
who
had
no
sooner
arrived
in
paris
than
he
had
begun
to
distinguish
himself
by
all
sorts
of
disgraceful
pranks
figuring
most
prominently
in
a
matrimonial
scandal
which
was
still
the
talk
of
the
neighbourhood
and
who
to
crown
all
had
suddenly
and
mysteriously
made
the
conquest
of
madame
hédouin
who
had
brought
him
the
ladies
paradise
as
a
marriage
portion
that
poor
caroline
interrupted
madame
baudu
we
were
distantly
related
if
she
had
lived
things
would
be
different
she
would
have
let
them
ruin
us
like
this
and
he
the
man
who
killed
her
yes
with
that
very
building
one
morning
when
she
was
visiting
the
works
she
fell
into
a
hole
and
three
days
after
she
died
a
fine
strong
healthy
woman
who
had
never
known
what
illness
was
there
some
of
her
blood
in
the
foundations
of
that
house
so
speaking
she
pointed
to
the
establishment
opposite
with
her
pale
and
trembling
hand
denise
listening
as
to
a
fairy
tale
slightly
shuddered
the
sense
of
fear
which
had
mingled
with
the
temptation
she
had
felt
since
morning
was
due
perhaps
to
the
presence
of
that
woman
blood
which
she
fancied
she
could
now
detect
in
the
red
mortar
of
the
basement
it
seems
as
if
it
brought
him
good
luck
added
madame
baudu
without
mentioning
mouret
by
name
but
the
draper
full
of
disdain
for
these
old
women
tales
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
resumed
his
story
explaining
the
situation
commercially
the
ladies
paradise
had
been
founded
in
by
two
brothers
named
deleuze
on
the
death
of
the
elder
his
daughter
caroline
had
married
the
son
of
a
linen
manufacturer
charles
hédouin
and
later
on
becoming
a
widow
she
had
married
mouret
she
thus
brought
him
a
half
share
in
the
business
three
months
after
the
marriage
however
the
second
brother
deleuze
died
childless
so
that
when
caroline
met
her
death
mouret
became
sole
heir
sole
proprietor
of
the
ladies
paradise
yes
he
had
been
wonderfully
lucky
he
what
they
call
a
man
of
ideas
a
dangerous
busybody
who
will
overturn
the
whole
neighbourhood
if
he
left
to
himself
continued
baudu
i
fancy
that
caroline
who
was
rather
romantic
also
must
have
been
carried
away
by
the
gentleman
extravagant
plans
in
short
he
persuaded
her
to
buy
the
house
on
the
left
then
the
one
on
the
right
and
he
himself
on
becoming
his
own
master
bought
two
others
so
that
the
establishment
has
kept
on
growing
and
growing
to
such
a
point
that
it
now
threatens
to
swallow
us
all
up
he
was
addressing
denise
but
was
in
reality
speaking
for
himself
feeling
a
feverish
longing
to
recapitulate
this
story
which
continually
haunted
him
at
home
he
was
always
angry
and
full
of
bile
always
violent
with
fists
ever
clenched
madame
baudu
ceasing
to
interfere
sat
motionless
on
her
chair
geneviève
and
colomban
with
eyes
cast
down
were
picking
up
and
eating
the
crumbs
off
the
table
just
for
the
sake
of
something
to
do
it
was
so
warm
so
stuffy
in
that
tiny
room
that
pépé
had
fallen
asleep
with
his
head
on
the
table
and
even
eyes
were
closing
but
wait
a
bit
resumed
baudu
seized
with
a
sudden
fit
of
anger
such
jokers
always
go
to
smash
mouret
is
just
now
i
know
that
for
a
fact
he
been
forced
to
spend
all
his
savings
on
his
mania
for
extensions
and
advertisements
moreover
in
order
to
raise
additional
capital
he
has
induced
most
of
his
to
invest
all
they
possess
with
him
and
so
he
has
a
sou
to
help
himself
with
now
and
unless
a
miracle
be
worked
and
he
manages
to
treble
his
sales
as
he
hopes
to
do
you
see
what
a
crash
there
be
ah
not
but
that
day
i
illuminate
my
i
will
on
my
word
of
honour
and
he
went
on
in
a
revengeful
voice
to
hear
him
you
would
have
thought
that
the
fall
of
the
ladies
paradise
would
restore
the
dignity
and
prestige
of
commerce
had
any
one
ever
seen
such
doings
a
draper
shop
selling
everything
why
not
call
it
a
bazaar
at
once
and
the
employees
a
nice
set
they
were
too
a
lot
of
puppies
who
did
their
work
like
porters
at
a
railway
station
treating
both
goods
and
customers
as
if
they
were
so
many
parcels
taking
themselves
off
or
getting
the
sack
at
a
moment
notice
no
affection
no
morals
no
taste
and
all
at
once
he
appealed
to
colomban
as
a
witness
he
colomban
brought
up
in
the
good
old
school
knew
how
long
it
took
to
learn
all
the
cunning
and
trickery
of
the
trade
the
art
was
not
to
sell
much
but
to
sell
dear
and
then
too
colomban
could
tell
them
how
he
had
been
treated
carefully
looked
after
his
washing
and
mending
done
nursed
in
illness
considered
as
one
of
the
family
loved
in
fact
of
course
of
course
repeated
colomban
after
each
statement
made
by
his
governor
ah
you
the
last
of
the
old
stock
my
dear
fellow
baudu
ended
by
declaring
after
you
gone
there
be
none
left
you
are
my
sole
consolation
for
if
all
that
hurry
and
scurry
is
what
they
now
call
business
i
understand
nothing
of
it
and
would
rather
clear
out
geneviève
with
her
head
on
one
side
as
if
her
thick
hair
were
weighing
down
her
pale
brow
sat
watching
the
smiling
shopman
and
in
her
glance
there
was
a
gleam
of
suspicion
a
wish
to
see
whether
colomban
stricken
with
remorse
would
not
blush
at
all
this
praise
but
like
a
fellow
well
acquainted
with
every
trick
of
the
old
style
of
trade
he
retained
his
sedateness
his
air
with
just
a
touch
of
cunning
about
his
lips
however
baudu
still
went
on
louder
than
ever
accusing
the
people
opposite
that
pack
of
savages
who
murdered
each
other
in
their
struggle
for
existence
of
even
destroying
all
family
ties
and
he
mentioned
his
country
neighbours
the
lhommes
mother
father
and
son
all
employed
in
the
infernal
shop
people
who
virtually
had
no
home
but
were
always
out
and
about
leading
a
hotel
kind
of
existence
and
never
taking
a
meal
at
their
own
place
excepting
on
sundays
certainly
his
was
over
large
or
too
well
aired
or
lighted
but
at
least
it
spoke
to
him
of
his
life
for
he
had
lived
there
amidst
the
affection
of
his
kith
and
kin
whilst
speaking
his
eyes
wandered
about
the
room
and
he
shuddered
at
the
unavowed
idea
that
if
those
savages
should
succeed
in
ruining
his
trade
they
might
some
day
turn
him
out
of
this
hole
where
he
was
so
comfortable
with
his
wife
and
child
notwithstanding
the
seeming
assurance
with
which
he
predicted
the
utter
downfall
of
his
rivals
he
was
in
reality
terrified
feeling
at
heart
that
the
neighbourhood
was
being
gradually
invaded
and
devoured
well
i
do
want
to
disgust
you
he
resumed
trying
to
calm
himself
if
you
think
it
to
your
interest
to
go
there
i
shall
be
the
first
to
say
i
am
sure
of
that
uncle
murmured
denise
in
bewilderment
her
desire
to
enter
the
ladies
paradise
growing
keener
and
keener
amidst
all
this
display
of
passion
baudu
had
put
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
was
wearying
her
with
his
fixed
stare
but
look
here
he
resumed
you
who
know
the
business
do
you
think
it
right
that
a
simple
draper
shop
should
sell
everything
formerly
when
trade
was
trade
drapers
sold
nothing
but
drapery
but
now
they
are
doing
their
best
to
snap
up
every
branch
of
trade
and
ruin
their
neighbours
the
whole
neighbourhood
complains
of
it
every
small
tradesman
is
beginning
to
suffer
terribly
this
man
mouret
is
ruining
them
for
instance
bédoré
and
his
sister
who
keep
the
hosiery
shop
in
the
rue
gaillon
have
already
lost
half
their
customers
mademoiselle
tatin
who
sells
in
the
passage
choiseul
has
been
obliged
to
lower
her
prices
to
be
able
to
sell
at
all
and
the
effects
of
this
scourge
this
pest
are
felt
as
far
as
the
rue
where
i
hear
that
vanpouille
brothers
the
furriers
can
not
hold
out
much
longer
ah
drapers
selling
fur
goods
what
a
farce
another
of
mouret
ideas
and
gloves
added
madame
baudu
is
it
monstrous
he
has
even
dared
to
add
a
glove
department
yesterday
when
i
passed
down
the
rue
i
saw
quinette
the
glover
at
his
door
looking
so
downcast
that
i
had
the
heart
to
ask
him
how
business
was
going
and
umbrellas
resumed
baudu
that
the
climax
bourras
is
convinced
that
mouret
simply
wants
to
ruin
him
for
in
short
the
rhyme
between
umbrellas
and
drapery
but
bourras
is
firm
on
his
legs
and
wo
let
himself
be
butchered
we
shall
see
some
fun
one
of
these
days
then
baudu
went
on
to
speak
of
other
tradesmen
passing
the
whole
neighbourhood
in
review
now
and
again
he
let
slip
a
confession
if
vinçard
wanted
to
sell
it
was
time
for
the
rest
to
pack
up
for
vinçard
was
like
the
rats
who
make
haste
to
leave
a
house
when
it
threatens
ruin
then
however
immediately
afterwards
he
contradicted
himself
and
talked
of
an
alliance
an
understanding
between
the
small
tradesmen
to
enable
them
to
fight
the
colossus
for
a
moment
his
hands
shaking
and
his
mouth
twitching
nervously
he
hesitated
as
to
whether
he
should
speak
of
himself
at
last
he
made
up
his
mind
to
do
so
as
for
me
he
said
i
ca
complain
as
yet
of
course
he
has
done
me
harm
the
scoundrel
but
up
to
the
present
he
has
only
kept
ladies
cloths
light
stuffs
for
dresses
and
heavier
goods
for
mantles
people
still
come
to
me
for
men
goods
velvets
and
velveteens
for
shooting
suits
cloths
for
liveries
without
speaking
of
flannels
and
of
which
i
defy
him
to
show
so
complete
an
assortment
as
my
own
but
he
thinks
he
will
annoy
me
by
placing
his
cloth
department
right
in
front
of
my
door
you
seen
his
display
have
you
he
always
places
his
finest
mantles
there
surrounded
by
a
framework
of
cloth
in
pieces
a
cheapjack
parade
to
tempt
the
hussies
upon
my
word
i
should
be
ashamed
to
use
such
means
the
old
elbeuf
has
been
known
for
nearly
a
hundred
years
and
has
no
need
of
any
such
catchpenny
devices
at
its
door
as
long
as
i
live
it
shall
remain
as
i
took
it
with
its
four
samples
on
each
side
and
nothing
more
the
whole
family
was
becoming
affected
and
after
a
spell
of
silence
geneviève
ventured
to
make
a
remark
our
customers
know
and
like
us
papa
said
she
we
must
lose
heart
madame
desforges
and
madame
de
boves
have
been
and
i
am
expecting
madame
marty
for
some
flannel
for
my
part
declared
colomban
i
took
an
order
from
madame
bourdelais
yesterday
is
true
she
spoke
of
an
english
cheviot
marked
up
opposite
ten
sous
cheaper
than
ours
and
the
same
stuff
it
appears
fancy
murmured
madame
baudu
in
her
weak
voice
we
knew
that
house
when
it
was
scarcely
larger
than
a
handkerchief
yes
my
dear
denise
when
the
deleuzes
started
it
it
had
only
one
window
in
the
rue
and
such
a
tiny
one
there
was
barely
room
for
a
couple
of
pieces
of
print
and
two
or
three
pieces
of
calico
there
was
no
room
to
turn
round
in
the
shop
it
was
so
small
at
that
time
the
old
elbeuf
after
sixty
years
trading
was
already
such
as
you
see
it
now
ah
all
has
greatly
changed
greatly
changed
she
shook
her
head
the
drama
of
her
whole
life
was
expressed
in
those
few
words
born
in
the
old
house
she
loved
each
of
its
damp
stones
living
only
for
it
and
by
it
and
formerly
so
proud
of
that
house
the
finest
the
best
patronised
in
the
neighbourhood
she
had
had
the
daily
grief
of
seeing
the
rival
establishment
gradually
growing
in
importance
at
first
disdained
then
equal
to
her
own
and
finally
towering
above
it
and
threatening
all
this
was
to
her
an
sore
she
was
slowly
dying
from
sheer
grief
at
seeing
the
old
elbeuf
humiliated
if
she
still
lived
it
was
as
in
the
case
of
the
shop
itself
solely
by
the
effect
of
impulsion
but
she
well
realised
that
the
death
of
the
shop
would
be
hers
as
well
and
that
she
would
pass
away
on
the
day
when
it
should
close
silence
fell
baudu
began
softly
beating
a
tattoo
with
his
fingers
on
the
american
cloth
on
the
table
he
experienced
a
sort
of
lassitude
almost
a
regret
at
having
once
more
relieved
his
feelings
in
this
way
the
whole
family
shared
his
despondency
and
with
dreamy
eyes
chewed
the
cud
of
his
bitter
story
they
never
had
had
any
luck
the
children
had
been
brought
up
and
fortune
had
seemed
at
hand
when
suddenly
this
competition
had
arisen
and
ruined
all
their
hopes
and
there
was
also
that
house
at
rambouillet
that
country
house
to
which
the
draper
had
been
dreaming
of
retiring
for
the
last
ten
years
a
bargain
he
had
thought
when
he
acquired
it
but
it
had
proved
a
sorry
old
building
always
in
want
of
repairs
and
he
had
let
it
to
people
who
never
paid
any
rent
his
last
profits
were
swallowed
up
by
this
place
the
only
folly
he
had
been
guilty
of
in
his
honest
upright
career
as
a
tradesman
stubbornly
attached
to
the
old
ways
come
come
he
suddenly
exclaimed
we
must
make
room
for
the
others
that
enough
of
this
useless
talk
it
was
like
an
awakening
the
gas
was
hissing
in
the
lifeless
stifling
air
of
the
tiny
room
they
all
jumped
up
breaking
the
melancholy
silence
pépé
however
was
sleeping
so
soundly
that
they
decided
to
lay
him
on
some
bales
of
cloth
jean
had
already
returned
to
the
street
door
yawning
in
short
repeated
baudu
to
his
niece
you
can
do
as
you
like
we
have
explained
the
matter
to
you
that
all
you
know
your
own
business
best
he
gave
her
an
urgent
glance
waiting
for
a
decisive
answer
but
denise
whom
these
stories
had
inspired
with
a
still
greater
longing
to
enter
the
ladies
paradise
instead
of
turning
her
from
it
retained
her
quiet
gentle
demeanour
beneath
which
lurked
a
genuine
norman
obstinacy
and
she
simply
replied
we
see
uncle
then
she
spoke
of
going
to
bed
early
with
the
children
for
they
were
all
three
very
tired
but
it
had
only
just
struck
six
so
she
decided
to
stay
in
the
shop
a
little
longer
night
had
now
come
on
and
she
found
the
street
quite
dark
drenched
by
a
fine
close
rain
which
had
been
falling
since
sunset
it
came
on
her
as
a
surprise
a
few
minutes
had
sufficed
to
fill
the
roadway
with
puddles
a
stream
of
dirty
water
was
running
along
the
gutters
the
pavement
was
sticky
with
a
thick
black
mud
and
through
the
beating
rain
she
saw
nothing
but
a
confused
stream
of
umbrellas
pushing
along
and
swelling
in
the
gloom
like
great
black
wings
she
started
back
at
first
feeling
very
cold
oppressed
at
heart
by
the
shop
now
so
extremely
dismal
a
moist
breeze
the
breath
of
that
old
quarter
of
paris
came
in
from
the
street
it
seemed
as
if
the
rain
streaming
from
the
umbrellas
was
running
right
up
to
the
counters
as
if
the
pavement
with
its
mud
and
its
puddles
was
coming
into
the
shop
putting
the
finishing
touch
to
the
mouldiness
of
that
ancient
cavernous
white
with
saltpetre
it
was
quite
a
vision
of
old
paris
in
the
wet
and
it
made
her
shiver
with
distressful
astonishment
at
finding
the
great
city
so
cold
and
so
ugly
but
across
the
road
the
ladies
paradise
glowed
with
its
deep
serried
lines
of
gas
jets
she
moved
nearer
again
attracted
and
as
it
were
warmed
by
that
ardent
blaze
the
machine
was
still
roaring
active
as
ever
letting
its
steam
escape
with
a
last
roar
whilst
the
salesmen
folded
up
the
stuffs
and
the
cashiers
counted
the
receipts
seen
through
the
hazy
windows
the
lights
swarmed
vaguely
revealing
a
confused
interior
behind
the
curtain
of
falling
rain
the
vision
blurred
and
distant
assumed
the
appearance
of
a
giant
where
the
shadows
of
firemen
passed
black
against
the
red
glare
of
the
furnaces
the
displays
in
the
windows
likewise
became
indistinct
you
could
only
distinguish
the
snowy
lace
its
whiteness
heightened
by
the
ground
glass
globes
of
a
row
of
gas
jets
and
against
this
background
the
goods
stood
out
vigorously
the
velvet
mantle
trimmed
with
silver
fox
setting
amidst
them
all
the
curved
silhouette
of
a
headless
woman
who
seemed
to
be
running
through
the
rain
to
some
entertainment
in
the
unknown
shades
of
nocturnal
paris
denise
yielding
to
the
fascination
had
gone
to
the
door
heedless
of
the
raindrops
dripping
upon
her
at
this
hour
the
ladies
paradise
with
its
brilliancy
completed
its
conquest
of
her
in
the
great
metropolis
black
and
silent
beneath
the
rain
in
this
paris
to
which
she
was
a
stranger
it
shone
out
like
a
lighthouse
and
seemed
to
be
of
itself
the
life
and
light
of
the
city
she
dreamed
of
her
future
there
working
hard
to
bring
up
the
children
with
other
things
besides
she
hardly
knew
what
things
however
the
desire
and
fear
of
which
made
her
tremble
the
idea
of
that
woman
who
had
met
her
death
amidst
the
foundations
came
back
to
her
and
she
felt
afraid
fancying
that
the
lights
were
tinged
with
blood
but
the
whiteness
of
the
lace
quieted
her
a
hope
quite
a
certainty
of
happiness
sprang
up
in
her
heart
whilst
the
fine
rain
blowing
on
her
cooled
her
hands
and
calmed
the
feverishness
within
her
born
of
her
journey
it
bourras
all
at
once
said
a
voice
behind
her
she
leant
forward
and
perceived
the
motionless
before
the
window
containing
the
ingenious
construction
of
umbrellas
and
which
she
had
noticed
in
the
morning
the
old
man
had
slipped
up
there
in
the
dark
to
feast
his
eyes
on
that
triumphant
show
and
so
great
was
his
grief
that
he
was
unconscious
of
the
rain
beating
down
on
his
bare
head
and
streaming
off
his
long
white
hair
how
stupid
he
is
he
make
himself
ill
resumed
the
voice
then
turning
round
denise
again
found
the
baudus
behind
her
though
they
thought
bourras
so
stupid
they
also
despite
themselves
ever
and
ever
returned
to
the
contemplation
of
that
spectacle
which
rent
their
hearts
it
was
so
to
say
a
rageful
desire
to
suffer
geneviève
very
pale
had
noticed
that
colomban
was
watching
the
shadows
of
the
saleswomen
pass
to
and
fro
on
the
first
floor
opposite
and
whilst
baudu
almost
choked
with
suppressed
rancour
madame
baudu
began
silently
weeping
you
go
and
see
wo
you
denise
asked
the
draper
tormented
with
uncertainty
but
feeling
that
his
niece
was
conquered
like
the
rest
she
hesitated
then
gently
replied
yes
uncle
unless
it
pains
you
too
much
chapter
ii
the
next
morning
at
seven
denise
was
outside
the
paradise
wishing
to
call
there
before
taking
jean
to
his
new
place
which
was
a
long
way
off
at
the
top
of
the
faubourg
du
temple
but
accustomed
as
she
was
to
early
hours
she
had
come
down
too
soon
the
employees
were
barely
arriving
and
afraid
of
looking
ridiculous
overcome
by
timidity
she
remained
for
a
moment
walking
up
and
down
the
place
gaillon
the
cold
wind
that
blew
had
already
dried
the
pavement
from
all
the
surrounding
streets
illumined
by
a
pale
early
light
falling
from
an
ashen
sky
shopmen
were
hurriedly
approaching
with
their
turned
up
and
their
hands
in
their
pockets
taken
unawares
by
this
first
chill
of
winter
most
of
them
hurried
along
alone
and
vanished
into
the
warehouse
without
addressing
a
word
or
look
to
their
colleagues
marching
along
around
them
others
however
came
up
in
twos
and
threes
talking
fast
and
monopolising
the
whole
of
the
pavement
and
all
with
a
similar
gesture
flung
away
their
cigarettes
or
cigars
before
crossing
the
threshold
denise
noticed
that
several
of
the
gentlemen
took
stock
of
her
in
passing
this
increased
her
timidity
and
she
no
longer
had
courage
to
follow
them
but
resolved
to
wait
till
they
had
entered
blushing
at
the
mere
idea
of
being
elbowed
at
the
door
by
all
these
men
however
the
stream
of
salesmen
still
flowed
on
and
in
order
to
escape
their
looks
she
took
a
walk
round
the
place
when
she
came
back
again
she
found
a
tall
young
man
pale
and
awkward
who
appeared
to
be
waiting
like
herself
i
beg
your
pardon
mademoiselle
he
finished
by
stammering
but
perhaps
you
belong
to
the
establishment
she
was
so
troubled
at
hearing
a
stranger
address
her
that
she
did
not
at
first
reply
the
fact
is
he
continued
getting
more
confused
than
ever
i
thought
of
applying
to
see
if
i
could
get
an
engagement
and
you
might
have
given
me
a
little
information
he
was
as
timid
as
she
was
and
had
probably
risked
speaking
to
her
because
he
divined
that
she
was
trembling
like
himself
i
would
with
pleasure
sir
she
at
last
replied
but
i
no
better
off
than
you
are
i
just
going
to
apply
myself
ah
very
good
said
he
quite
out
of
countenance
thereupon
they
both
blushed
deeply
and
still
all
timidity
remained
for
a
moment
face
to
face
affected
by
the
striking
similarity
of
their
positions
yet
not
daring
to
openly
express
a
desire
for
each
success
then
as
nothing
further
fell
from
either
and
both
became
more
and
more
uncomfortable
they
parted
awkwardly
and
renewed
their
wait
one
on
either
side
at
a
distance
of
a
few
steps
the
shopmen
continued
to
arrive
and
denise
could
now
hear
them
joking
as
they
passed
casting
side
glances
towards
her
her
confusion
increased
at
finding
herself
thus
on
exhibition
and
she
had
decided
to
take
half
an
hour
walk
in
the
neighbourhood
when
the
sight
of
a
young
man
approaching
rapidly
by
way
of
the
rue
detained
her
for
another
moment
he
was
probably
the
manager
of
a
department
thought
she
for
all
the
others
raised
their
hats
to
him
tall
with
a
clear
skin
and
carefully
trimmed
beard
he
had
eyes
the
colour
of
old
gold
and
of
a
velvety
softness
which
he
fixed
on
her
for
a
moment
as
he
crossed
the
place
he
was
already
entering
the
shop
with
an
air
of
indifference
while
she
remained
motionless
quite
upset
by
that
glance
of
his
filled
indeed
with
a
singular
emotion
in
which
there
was
more
uneasiness
than
pleasure
without
doubt
fear
was
gaining
on
her
and
to
give
herself
time
to
collect
her
courage
she
began
slowly
walking
down
the
rue
gaillon
and
then
along
the
rue
the
person
who
had
so
disturbed
her
was
more
than
the
manager
of
a
department
it
was
octave
mouret
in
person
he
had
been
making
a
night
of
it
and
his
tightly
buttoned
overcoat
concealed
a
dress
suit
and
white
tie
in
all
haste
he
ran
upstairs
to
his
rooms
washed
himself
and
changed
his
clothes
and
when
he
at
last
seated
himself
at
his
table
in
his
private
office
on
the
first
floor
he
was
at
his
ease
and
full
of
strength
with
bright
eyes
and
cool
skin
as
ready
for
work
as
if
he
had
enjoyed
ten
hours
sleep
the
spacious
office
furnished
in
old
oak
and
hung
with
green
rep
had
but
one
ornament
the
portrait
of
that
madame
hédouin
who
was
still
the
talk
of
the
whole
neighbourhood
since
her
death
octave
ever
thought
of
her
with
tender
regret
grateful
as
he
felt
to
her
for
the
fortune
she
had
bestowed
on
him
with
her
hand
and
before
commencing
to
sign
the
drafts
laid
upon
his
he
darted
upon
her
portrait
the
contented
smile
of
a
happy
man
was
it
not
always
before
her
that
he
returned
to
work
after
the
escapades
of
his
present
there
came
a
knock
however
and
before
mouret
could
answer
a
young
man
entered
a
tall
bony
fellow
very
gentlemanly
and
correct
in
his
appearance
with
thin
lips
a
sharp
nose
and
smooth
hair
already
showing
signs
of
turning
grey
mouret
raised
his
eyes
then
whilst
still
signing
the
drafts
remarked
i
hope
you
slept
well
bourdoncle
very
well
thanks
replied
the
young
man
walking
about
as
if
he
were
quite
at
home
bourdoncle
the
son
of
a
poor
farmer
near
limoges
had
begun
his
career
at
the
ladies
paradise
at
the
same
time
as
mouret
when
it
only
occupied
the
corner
of
the
place
gaillon
very
intelligent
and
very
active
it
then
seemed
as
if
he
would
easily
supplant
his
comrade
who
was
much
less
steady
and
far
too
fond
of
but
he
had
neither
the
instinctive
genius
of
the
impassioned
southerner
nor
his
audacity
nor
his
winning
grace
besides
by
a
wise
instinct
he
had
from
the
first
bowed
before
him
obedient
without
a
struggle
when
mouret
had
advised
his
people
to
put
their
money
into
the
business
bourdoncle
had
been
one
of
the
first
to
do
so
even
investing
in
the
establishment
the
proceeds
of
an
unexpected
legacy
left
him
by
an
aunt
and
little
by
little
after
passing
through
all
the
various
stages
such
as
salesman
second
and
then
in
the
silk
department
he
had
become
one
of
octave
most
cherished
and
influential
lieutenants
one
of
the
six
intéressés
who
assisted
him
to
govern
the
ladies
paradise
forming
something
like
a
privy
council
under
an
absolute
king
each
one
watched
over
a
department
or
province
bourdoncle
for
his
part
exercised
a
general
surveillance
in
the
great
paris
magasins
de
nouveautés
such
as
the
louvre
and
bon
marché
there
have
been
at
various
stages
numerous
intéressés
that
is
partners
of
a
kind
who
whilst
entitled
to
some
share
of
the
profits
exercise
but
a
strictly
limited
control
in
the
management
of
the
establishment
and
you
resumed
he
familiarly
have
you
slept
well
when
mouret
replied
that
he
had
not
been
to
bed
he
shook
his
head
murmuring
bad
habits
why
replied
the
other
gaily
i
not
so
tired
as
you
are
my
dear
fellow
you
are
half
asleep
now
you
lead
too
quiet
a
life
take
a
little
amusement
that
wake
you
up
a
bit
this
was
their
constant
friendly
dispute
bourdoncle
who
professed
to
hate
all
women
contented
himself
with
encouraging
the
extravagance
of
the
lady
customers
feeling
meantime
the
greatest
disdain
for
the
frivolity
which
led
them
to
ruin
themselves
in
stupid
gewgaws
mouret
on
the
contrary
affected
to
worship
them
ever
showed
himself
delighted
and
cajoling
in
their
presence
and
was
ever
embarking
in
fresh
this
served
as
it
were
as
an
advertisement
for
his
business
and
you
might
have
said
that
he
enveloped
all
women
in
the
same
caress
the
better
to
bewilder
them
and
keep
them
at
his
mercy
i
saw
madame
desforges
last
night
she
was
looking
delicious
at
that
ball
said
he
beginning
to
relate
his
evening
experiences
but
then
abruptly
breaking
off
he
took
up
another
bundle
of
drafts
which
he
began
to
sign
whilst
bourdoncle
continued
to
walk
about
stepping
towards
the
lofty
windows
whence
he
glanced
into
the
rue
then
retracing
his
steps
he
suddenly
exclaimed
you
know
they
have
their
revenge
who
will
asked
mouret
who
had
lost
the
thread
of
the
conversation
why
the
women
at
this
mouret
became
quite
merry
displaying
beneath
his
adorative
manner
his
really
brutal
character
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
he
seemed
to
declare
he
would
throw
them
all
over
like
so
many
empty
sacks
as
soon
as
they
should
have
finished
helping
him
to
make
his
fortune
but
bourdoncle
in
his
frigid
way
obstinately
repeated
they
will
have
their
revenge
there
will
be
one
who
will
some
day
avenge
all
the
others
it
bound
to
be
no
fear
cried
mouret
exaggerating
his
southern
accent
that
one
is
born
yet
my
boy
and
if
she
comes
you
know
why
there
so
saying
he
raised
his
penholder
brandishing
it
and
pointing
it
in
the
air
as
if
he
were
bent
on
stabbing
some
invisible
heart
with
a
knife
bourdoncle
thereupon
resumed
his
walk
bowing
as
usual
before
the
superiority
of
the
governor
whose
genius
with
all
its
lapses
disconcerted
him
he
himself
so
logical
and
passionless
incapable
of
falling
into
the
toils
of
a
syren
had
yet
to
learn
the
feminine
character
of
success
all
paris
yielding
herself
with
a
kiss
to
her
boldest
assailant
a
silence
fell
broken
only
by
the
sound
of
mouret
pen
then
in
reply
to
his
brief
questions
bourdoncle
gave
him
various
information
respecting
of
the
great
sale
of
winter
novelties
which
was
to
commence
on
the
following
monday
this
was
an
important
affair
the
house
was
risking
its
fortune
in
it
for
the
rumours
of
the
neighbourhood
had
some
foundation
mouret
was
throwing
himself
into
speculation
like
a
poet
with
such
ostentation
such
desire
to
attain
the
colossal
that
everything
seemed
likely
to
give
way
under
him
it
was
quite
a
new
style
of
doing
business
a
seeming
commercial
phantasy
which
had
formerly
made
madame
hédouin
anxious
and
even
now
notwithstanding
certain
successes
quite
dismayed
those
who
had
capital
in
the
business
they
blamed
the
governor
in
secret
for
going
too
quick
accused
him
of
having
enlarged
the
establishment
to
a
dangerous
extent
before
making
sure
of
a
sufficient
increase
of
custom
above
all
they
trembled
on
seeing
him
put
all
the
available
cash
into
one
venture
filling
the
departments
with
a
pile
of
goods
without
leaving
a
copper
in
the
reserve
fund
thus
for
this
winter
sale
after
the
heavy
sums
recently
paid
to
the
builders
the
whole
capital
was
exhausted
and
it
once
more
became
a
question
of
victory
or
death
yet
mouret
in
the
midst
of
all
this
excitement
preserved
a
triumphant
gaiety
a
certainty
of
gaining
millions
like
a
man
so
worshipped
by
women
that
there
could
be
no
question
of
betrayal
when
bourdoncle
ventured
to
express
certain
fears
with
reference
to
the
excessive
development
given
to
several
departments
of
doubtful
profit
he
gave
vent
to
a
laugh
full
of
confidence
and
exclaimed
pooh
pooh
my
dear
fellow
the
place
is
still
too
small
the
other
appeared
dumbfounded
seized
with
a
fear
which
he
no
longer
attempted
to
conceal
the
house
too
small
an
establishment
which
comprised
nineteen
departments
and
numbered
four
hundred
and
three
employees
of
course
resumed
mouret
we
shall
be
obliged
to
enlarge
our
premises
again
before
another
eighteen
months
are
over
i
seriously
thinking
about
the
matter
last
night
madame
desforges
promised
to
introduce
me
to
some
one
who
may
be
useful
in
short
we
talk
it
over
when
the
idea
is
ripe
then
having
finished
signing
his
drafts
he
rose
and
tapped
his
lieutenant
on
the
shoulder
in
a
friendly
manner
but
the
latter
could
not
get
over
his
astonishment
the
fright
displayed
by
the
prudent
people
around
him
amused
mouret
in
one
of
those
fits
of
brusque
frankness
with
which
he
sometimes
overwhelmed
his
familiars
he
declared
that
he
was
at
heart
a
greater
jew
than
all
the
jews
in
the
world
he
took
said
he
after
his
father
whom
he
resembled
physically
and
morally
a
fellow
who
knew
the
value
of
money
and
if
his
mother
had
given
him
that
dash
of
nervous
fantasy
which
he
displayed
it
was
perhaps
the
principal
element
of
his
luck
for
he
felt
that
his
ability
to
dare
everything
was
an
invincible
force
oh
you
know
very
well
that
we
stand
by
you
to
the
last
bourdoncle
finished
by
saying
then
before
going
down
into
the
shop
to
give
their
usual
look
round
they
settled
certain
other
details
they
examined
a
specimen
of
a
little
book
of
account
forms
which
mouret
had
just
invented
for
the
use
of
his
employees
having
remarked
that
the
goods
the
dead
stock
went
off
the
more
rapidly
the
higher
the
commission
allowed
to
the
employees
he
had
based
on
this
observation
quite
a
new
system
that
of
interesting
his
people
in
the
sale
of
all
the
goods
giving
them
a
commission
on
even
the
smallest
piece
of
stuff
the
most
trumpery
article
they
sold
this
innovation
had
caused
quite
a
revolution
in
the
drapery
trade
creating
between
the
salespeople
a
struggle
for
existence
of
which
the
masters
reaped
the
benefits
to
foment
this
struggle
was
indeed
mouret
favourite
method
the
principle
which
he
constantly
applied
he
excited
his
passions
pitted
one
against
the
other
allowed
the
stronger
to
swallow
up
the
weaker
ones
and
for
his
own
part
battened
on
this
struggle
of
conflicting
interests
the
sample
account
book
was
duly
approved
of
at
the
top
of
each
leaf
on
both
counterfoil
and
bill
form
appeared
particulars
of
the
department
and
the
salesman
number
then
also
in
duplicate
came
columns
for
the
measurement
the
description
of
the
goods
sold
and
their
price
the
salesman
simply
signed
the
bill
form
before
handing
it
to
the
cashier
and
in
this
way
an
easy
account
was
kept
it
was
only
necessary
to
compare
the
delivered
by
the
cashier
department
to
the
with
the
counterfoils
every
week
the
latter
would
receive
their
commission
without
any
possibility
of
error
we
sha
be
robbed
so
much
remarked
bourdoncle
with
satisfaction
this
was
a
very
good
idea
of
yours
and
i
thought
of
something
else
last
night
explained
mouret
yes
my
dear
fellow
at
supper
i
have
an
idea
of
giving
the
clerks
a
little
bonus
for
every
error
they
detect
while
checking
the
bills
you
understand
eh
like
this
we
shall
be
sure
that
they
pass
any
for
rather
than
do
that
they
be
inventing
mistakes
he
began
to
laugh
whilst
the
other
looked
at
him
admiringly
this
new
application
of
the
theory
delighted
mouret
he
had
a
real
genius
for
administrative
functions
and
dreamed
of
so
organizing
the
establishment
as
to
trade
upon
the
selfish
instincts
of
his
employees
for
the
greater
satisfaction
of
his
own
appetites
he
often
said
that
to
make
people
do
their
best
and
even
to
keep
them
fairly
honest
it
was
first
of
all
necessary
to
excite
their
selfish
desires
well
let
go
downstairs
he
resumed
we
must
look
after
this
sale
the
silk
arrived
yesterday
i
believe
and
bouthemont
must
be
getting
it
in
now
bourdoncle
followed
him
the
receiving
office
was
in
the
basement
on
the
side
of
the
rue
there
on
a
level
with
the
pavement
was
a
kind
of
glazed
cage
into
which
the
vans
discharged
the
goods
they
were
weighed
and
then
shot
down
a
rapid
slide
whose
oak
and
iron
work
was
polished
by
the
constant
chaffing
of
bales
and
cases
everything
entered
by
this
yawning
trap
it
was
a
continuous
swallowing
up
a
niagara
of
goods
falling
with
a
roar
like
that
of
a
torrent
at
the
approach
of
big
sale
times
especially
the
slide
brought
down
an
endless
stream
of
lyons
silks
english
woollens
flemish
linens
alsatian
calicoes
and
rouen
prints
the
vans
were
sometimes
obliged
to
wait
their
turn
along
the
street
and
as
each
bale
rushed
down
to
the
basement
there
arose
a
sound
as
of
a
stone
thrown
into
deep
water
on
his
way
mouret
stopped
for
a
moment
before
the
slide
which
was
in
full
activity
rows
of
cases
were
coming
down
of
themselves
falling
like
rain
from
some
upper
stream
then
bales
appeared
toppling
over
in
their
descent
like
rolling
stones
mouret
looked
on
without
saying
a
word
but
this
wealth
of
goods
rushing
in
to
his
establishment
at
the
rate
of
thousands
of
francs
each
minute
made
his
clear
eyes
glisten
he
had
never
before
had
such
a
clear
definite
idea
of
the
struggle
he
was
engaged
in
it
was
this
falling
mountain
of
goods
which
he
must
cast
to
the
four
corners
of
paris
he
did
not
open
his
mouth
however
but
continued
his
inspection
by
the
grey
light
which
came
in
through
the
large
a
squad
of
men
were
receiving
the
goods
whilst
others
removed
the
lids
of
the
cases
and
opened
the
bales
in
presence
of
the
managers
of
different
departments
a
dockyard
kind
of
bustle
filled
this
basement
whose
vaulted
roofing
was
supported
by
pillars
and
whose
bare
walls
were
simply
cemented
have
you
got
everything
there
bouthemont
asked
mouret
approaching
a
young
fellow
who
was
checking
the
contents
of
a
case
yes
everything
seems
all
right
replied
he
but
the
counting
will
take
me
all
the
morning
then
the
manager
of
the
silk
department
ran
down
an
invoice
he
held
standing
the
while
before
a
large
counter
on
which
one
of
his
salesmen
deposited
one
by
one
the
pieces
of
silk
which
he
took
from
an
open
case
behind
them
ran
other
counters
also
littered
with
goods
which
a
small
army
of
shopmen
was
examining
it
was
a
general
unpacking
a
seeming
confusion
of
stuffs
inspected
turned
over
and
marked
amidst
a
continuous
buzz
of
voices
bouthemont
who
was
becoming
a
celebrity
in
the
trade
had
the
round
jovial
face
of
a
right
good
fellow
with
a
beard
and
fine
hazel
eyes
born
at
montpellier
noisy
and
over
fond
of
pleasure
he
was
not
of
much
good
for
the
sales
but
in
buying
he
had
not
his
equal
sent
to
paris
by
his
father
who
kept
a
draper
shop
in
his
native
town
he
had
absolutely
refused
to
return
home
when
the
old
fellow
thinking
that
he
ought
to
know
enough
to
succeed
him
in
his
business
had
summoned
him
to
do
so
and
from
that
moment
a
rivalry
had
sprung
up
between
father
and
son
the
former
absorbed
in
his
little
country
business
and
shocked
to
see
a
simple
shopman
earning
three
times
as
much
as
he
did
himself
and
the
latter
joking
at
the
old
man
humdrum
routine
chinking
his
money
and
throwing
the
whole
house
into
confusion
at
every
flying
visit
he
paid
like
the
other
managers
bouthemont
drew
besides
his
three
thousand
francs
regular
pay
a
commission
on
the
sales
montpellier
surprised
and
respectful
whispered
that
young
bouthemont
had
made
fifteen
thousand
francs
the
year
before
and
that
that
was
only
a
beginning
people
prophesied
to
the
exasperated
father
that
this
figure
would
certainly
increase
meantime
bourdoncle
had
taken
up
one
of
the
pieces
of
silk
and
was
examining
the
texture
with
the
eye
of
a
connoisseur
it
was
a
faille
with
a
blue
and
silver
selvage
the
famous
paris
delight
with
which
mouret
hoped
to
strike
a
decisive
blow
it
is
really
very
good
observed
bourdoncle
and
the
effect
it
produces
is
better
than
its
real
quality
said
bouthemont
dumonteil
is
the
only
one
capable
of
manufacturing
such
stuff
last
journey
when
i
fell
out
with
gaujean
the
latter
was
willing
to
set
a
hundred
looms
to
work
on
this
pattern
but
he
asked
five
sous
a
yard
more
nearly
every
month
bouthemont
went
to
lyons
staying
there
days
together
living
at
the
best
hôtels
with
orders
to
treat
the
manufacturers
with
open
purse
he
enjoyed
moreover
a
perfect
liberty
and
bought
what
he
liked
provided
that
he
increased
the
yearly
business
of
his
department
in
a
certain
proportion
settled
beforehand
and
it
was
on
this
proportion
that
his
commission
was
based
in
short
his
position
at
the
ladies
paradise
like
that
of
all
the
managers
was
that
of
a
special
tradesman
in
a
grouping
of
various
businesses
a
sort
of
vast
trading
city
so
resumed
he
it
decided
we
mark
it
at
five
francs
twelve
sous
it
barely
the
cost
price
you
know
yes
yes
five
francs
twelve
sous
said
mouret
quickly
and
if
i
were
alone
i
sell
it
at
a
loss
the
manager
laughed
heartily
oh
i
do
mind
its
cheapness
will
treble
the
sales
and
my
only
interest
is
to
secure
heavy
receipts
but
bourdoncle
remained
grave
biting
his
lips
for
his
part
he
drew
his
commission
on
the
total
profits
and
it
was
not
to
his
advantage
that
the
prices
should
be
lowered
as
it
happened
a
part
of
his
duties
was
to
exercise
a
control
over
the
prices
fixed
upon
in
order
to
prevent
bouthemont
from
selling
at
too
small
a
profit
for
the
sole
purpose
of
increasing
the
sales
moreover
all
his
former
anxiety
reappeared
in
the
presence
of
these
advertising
combinations
which
he
did
not
understand
and
he
ventured
to
display
his
repugnance
by
remarking
if
we
sell
it
at
five
francs
twelve
sous
it
will
be
like
selling
it
at
a
loss
as
we
must
allow
for
our
expenses
which
are
considerable
it
would
fetch
seven
francs
anywhere
at
this
mouret
got
angry
striking
the
silk
with
his
open
hand
he
exclaimed
excitedly
i
know
that
that
why
i
want
to
give
it
to
our
customers
really
my
dear
fellow
you
never
understand
ways
do
you
see
that
they
fight
together
over
this
silk
no
doubt
interrupted
the
other
obstinately
and
the
more
they
buy
the
more
we
shall
lose
we
shall
lose
a
few
sous
on
the
stuff
very
likely
but
what
can
that
matter
if
in
return
we
attract
all
the
women
here
and
keep
them
at
our
mercy
fascinated
maddened
by
the
sight
of
our
goods
emptying
their
purses
without
thinking
the
principal
thing
my
dear
fellow
is
to
inflame
them
and
for
that
purpose
you
must
have
an
article
which
will
flatter
them
and
cause
a
sensation
afterwards
you
can
sell
the
other
articles
as
dear
as
they
are
sold
anywhere
else
they
still
think
yours
the
cheapest
for
instance
our
golden
grain
that
taffetas
at
seven
francs
and
a
half
sold
everywhere
at
the
same
price
will
go
down
as
an
extraordinary
bargain
and
suffice
to
make
up
for
the
loss
on
the
paris
delight
you
see
you
see
he
was
becoming
quite
eloquent
do
you
understand
he
resumed
in
a
week
time
from
i
want
the
paris
delight
to
effect
a
revolution
in
the
market
it
our
which
will
save
us
and
send
our
name
everything
nothing
else
will
be
talked
of
that
blue
and
silver
selvage
will
be
known
from
one
to
the
other
end
of
france
and
you
hear
the
furious
complaints
of
our
competitors
the
small
traders
will
lose
another
wing
by
it
yes
we
shall
have
done
for
all
those
who
are
dying
of
rheumatism
in
their
cellars
the
shopmen
checking
the
goods
were
listening
and
smiling
mouret
liked
to
talk
in
this
way
without
contradiction
bourdoncle
yielded
once
more
however
the
case
of
silk
was
now
empty
and
two
men
were
opening
another
it
the
manufacturers
who
are
vexed
now
said
bouthemont
at
lyons
they
are
all
furious
with
you
they
pretend
that
your
cheap
trading
is
ruining
them
you
are
aware
that
gaujean
has
positively
declared
war
against
me
yes
he
has
sworn
to
give
long
credits
to
the
little
houses
rather
than
accept
my
prices
mouret
shrugged
his
shoulders
if
gaujean
does
behave
sensibly
he
replied
gaujean
will
be
floored
what
do
they
all
complain
of
we
pay
ready
money
and
we
take
all
they
can
make
it
strange
if
they
work
cheaper
at
that
rate
besides
the
public
gets
the
benefit
and
that
everything
the
shopman
now
began
emptying
the
second
case
whilst
bouthemont
checked
the
pieces
by
the
invoice
another
employee
at
the
end
of
the
counter
then
marked
them
in
plain
figures
and
the
checking
finished
the
invoice
signed
by
the
manager
had
to
be
sent
to
the
chief
cashier
office
for
another
minute
mouret
continued
looking
at
the
work
at
all
the
activity
around
this
unpacking
of
goods
which
threatened
to
drown
the
basement
then
never
adding
a
word
but
with
the
air
of
a
captain
satisfied
with
his
men
he
went
off
again
followed
by
bourdoncle
they
slowly
crossed
the
basement
floor
the
placed
at
intervals
admitted
a
pale
light
while
in
the
dark
corners
and
along
the
narrow
corridors
gas
was
constantly
burning
in
these
corridors
were
the
reserves
large
vaults
closed
with
iron
railings
containing
the
surplus
goods
of
each
department
as
he
passed
along
mouret
glanced
at
the
heating
apparatus
which
was
to
be
lighted
on
the
following
monday
for
the
first
time
and
at
the
firemen
guarding
a
giant
enclosed
in
an
iron
cage
the
kitchen
and
old
cellars
turned
into
habitable
apartments
were
on
the
left
near
the
corner
of
the
place
gaillon
at
last
right
at
the
other
end
of
the
basement
he
arrived
at
the
delivery
office
here
all
the
purchases
which
customers
did
not
take
away
with
them
were
sent
down
sorted
on
tables
and
placed
in
compartments
each
of
which
represented
a
particular
district
of
paris
then
by
a
large
staircase
opening
just
opposite
the
old
elbeuf
they
were
sent
up
to
the
vans
standing
alongside
the
pavement
in
the
mechanical
working
of
the
ladies
paradise
this
staircase
in
the
rue
de
la
michodière
was
ever
disgorging
the
goods
devoured
by
the
slide
in
the
rue
after
they
had
passed
through
the
mill
of
the
counters
up
above
campion
said
mouret
to
the
delivery
manager
a
retired
sergeant
with
a
thin
face
why
were
six
pairs
of
sheets
bought
by
a
lady
yesterday
about
two
delivered
in
the
evening
where
does
the
lady
live
asked
the
employee
in
the
rue
de
rivoli
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
madame
desforges
at
this
early
hour
the
sorting
tables
were
yet
bare
and
the
compartments
only
contained
a
few
parcels
left
over
night
whilst
campion
was
searching
amongst
these
packets
after
consulting
a
list
bourdoncle
looked
at
mouret
reflecting
that
this
wonderful
fellow
knew
everything
thought
of
everything
even
when
he
was
supposed
to
be
amusing
himself
at
last
campion
discovered
the
error
the
department
had
given
a
wrong
number
and
the
parcel
had
come
back
what
is
the
number
of
the
that
debited
the
order
asked
mouret
no
you
say
and
turning
towards
his
lieutenant
he
added
no
that
albert
is
it
we
just
say
two
words
to
him
however
before
starting
on
a
tour
round
the
shops
he
wanted
to
go
up
to
the
postal
order
department
which
occupied
several
rooms
on
the
second
floor
it
was
there
that
all
the
provincial
and
foreign
orders
arrived
and
he
went
up
every
morning
to
see
the
correspondence
for
two
years
this
correspondence
had
been
increasing
daily
at
first
occupying
only
a
dozen
clerks
it
now
required
more
than
thirty
some
opened
the
letters
and
others
read
them
seated
on
either
side
of
the
same
table
others
again
classified
them
giving
each
one
a
running
number
which
was
repeated
on
a
then
when
the
letters
had
been
distributed
to
the
different
departments
and
the
latter
had
delivered
the
articles
ordered
these
articles
were
placed
in
the
as
they
arrived
in
accordance
with
running
numbers
nothing
then
remained
but
to
check
and
pack
them
which
was
done
in
a
neighbouring
room
by
a
squad
of
workmen
who
were
nailing
and
tying
up
from
morning
to
night
mouret
put
his
usual
question
how
many
letters
this
morning
levasseur
five
hundred
and
sir
replied
the
chief
clerk
after
the
new
sale
has
begun
on
monday
i
afraid
we
have
enough
hands
yesterday
we
were
driven
very
hard
bourdoncle
expressed
his
satisfaction
by
a
nod
of
the
head
he
had
not
reckoned
on
five
hundred
and
letters
arriving
on
a
tuesday
round
the
table
the
clerks
continued
opening
and
reading
the
letters
the
paper
rustling
all
the
time
whilst
before
the
the
various
articles
ordered
began
to
arrive
this
was
one
of
the
most
complicated
and
important
departments
of
the
establishment
and
the
rush
was
continual
for
strictly
speaking
all
the
orders
received
in
the
morning
ought
to
be
sent
off
the
same
evening
you
shall
have
whatever
more
hands
you
want
replied
mouret
who
had
seen
at
a
glance
that
the
work
of
the
department
was
well
done
when
there
work
he
added
we
never
refuse
the
men
up
above
under
the
roof
were
the
bedrooms
occupied
by
the
saleswomen
however
mouret
went
downstairs
again
and
entered
the
chief
cash
office
which
was
near
his
own
it
was
a
room
with
a
glazed
partition
in
which
was
a
wicket
and
it
contained
an
enormous
safe
fixed
in
the
wall
two
cashiers
here
centralised
the
receipts
which
lhomme
the
chief
cashier
of
the
sales
service
brought
in
every
evening
and
with
these
receipts
they
discharged
the
current
expenses
paid
the
manufacturers
the
staff
all
the
people
indeed
who
lived
by
the
house
their
office
communicated
with
another
full
of
green
cardboard
boxes
where
some
ten
clerks
checked
the
innumerable
invoices
then
came
yet
a
third
office
the
so
to
say
where
six
young
men
bending
over
black
desks
with
quite
a
collection
of
registers
behind
them
made
up
the
commission
accounts
of
the
salesmen
by
checking
the
debit
notes
this
department
but
recently
organized
did
not
as
yet
work
particularly
well
mouret
and
bourdoncle
crossed
the
cashier
office
and
the
invoice
room
and
when
they
passed
into
the
third
office
the
young
men
there
who
were
laughing
and
joking
together
started
with
surprise
mouret
without
reprimanding
them
thereupon
explained
his
scheme
of
giving
them
a
little
bonus
for
each
error
they
might
detect
in
the
debit
notes
and
when
he
went
out
the
clerks
quite
cured
of
all
inclination
for
idle
laughter
set
to
work
in
earnest
hunting
for
errors
on
reaching
the
occupied
by
the
shops
mouret
went
straight
to
no
where
albert
lhomme
was
polishing
his
nails
pending
the
arrival
of
customers
people
currently
spoke
of
the
lhomme
dynasty
since
madame
aurélie
in
the
mantle
department
after
helping
her
husband
to
secure
the
post
of
chief
cashier
had
further
managed
to
get
a
pay
desk
for
her
son
a
tall
pale
vicious
young
man
who
had
been
unable
to
remain
in
any
situation
and
had
caused
her
an
immense
deal
of
anxiety
on
reaching
his
desk
mouret
who
never
cared
to
render
himself
unpopular
by
performing
police
duty
and
from
policy
and
taste
preferred
to
play
the
part
of
a
benign
providence
retired
into
the
back
ground
after
gently
nudging
bourdoncle
with
his
elbow
it
was
bourdoncle
the
infallible
and
impeccable
whom
he
generally
charged
with
the
duty
of
reprimanding
monsieur
albert
said
bourdoncle
severely
you
have
again
taken
an
address
wrong
the
parcel
has
come
back
it
is
unbearable
the
cashier
thinking
it
advisable
to
defend
himself
called
as
a
witness
the
assistant
who
had
tied
up
the
packet
this
assistant
named
joseph
also
belonged
to
the
lhomme
dynasty
for
he
was
albert
foster
brother
and
likewise
owed
his
place
to
madame
aurélie
influence
albert
sought
to
make
him
say
that
the
mistake
had
been
made
by
the
customer
herself
but
all
joseph
could
do
was
to
stutter
and
twist
the
shaggy
beard
that
ornamented
his
scarred
face
struggling
the
while
between
his
conscience
and
his
gratitude
to
his
protectors
let
joseph
alone
bourdoncle
exclaimed
at
last
and
do
say
any
more
it
a
lucky
thing
for
you
that
we
are
mindful
of
your
good
services
however
at
this
moment
lhomme
senior
came
running
up
from
his
office
near
the
door
he
could
see
his
son
which
was
in
the
glove
department
and
doubtless
the
colloquy
had
alarmed
him
quite
already
deadened
by
his
sedentary
life
he
had
a
flabby
colourless
face
blanched
and
worn
as
it
were
by
the
reflection
of
the
money
he
was
continually
handling
the
circumstance
that
he
had
lost
an
arm
did
not
at
all
incommode
him
in
this
work
and
indeed
people
would
go
to
his
office
out
of
curiosity
to
see
him
verify
the
receipts
so
rapidly
did
the
notes
and
coins
slip
through
his
left
hand
the
only
one
remaining
to
him
the
son
of
a
at
chablis
he
had
come
to
paris
as
clerk
to
a
merchant
of
the
then
whilst
lodging
in
the
rue
cuvier
he
had
married
the
daughter
of
his
doorkeeper
a
petty
alsatian
tailor
and
from
that
day
onward
he
had
bowed
submissively
before
his
wife
whose
commercial
ability
filled
him
with
respect
she
now
earned
more
than
twelve
thousand
francs
a
year
in
the
mantle
department
whilst
he
only
drew
a
fixed
salary
of
five
thousand
francs
and
the
deference
he
felt
for
this
wife
who
brought
such
large
sums
into
the
household
was
extended
to
their
son
whom
he
also
owed
to
her
what
the
matter
he
murmured
is
albert
in
fault
then
according
to
his
custom
mouret
reappeared
on
the
scene
to
play
the
part
of
an
indulgent
prince
when
bourdoncle
had
made
himself
feared
he
looked
after
his
own
popularity
oh
nothing
of
consequence
he
answered
my
dear
lhomme
your
son
albert
is
a
careless
fellow
who
should
take
an
example
from
you
then
changing
the
subject
showing
himself
more
amiable
than
ever
he
continued
and
by
the
way
how
about
that
concert
the
other
day
did
you
get
a
good
seat
a
blush
spread
over
the
white
cheeks
of
the
old
cashier
music
was
his
only
vice
a
secret
vice
which
he
indulged
in
solitarily
frequenting
theatres
concerts
and
recitals
moreover
despite
the
loss
of
his
arm
he
played
on
the
french
horn
thanks
to
an
ingenious
system
of
claws
and
as
madame
lhomme
detested
noise
before
playing
his
instrument
of
an
evening
he
would
wrap
it
in
cloth
and
then
draw
from
it
all
sorts
of
weird
muffled
sounds
which
delighted
him
to
the
point
of
ecstasy
in
the
forced
irregularity
of
their
domestic
life
he
had
made
himself
an
oasis
of
his
passion
for
music
that
his
cash
receipts
and
his
admiration
for
his
wife
summed
up
his
whole
existence
a
very
good
seat
he
replied
with
sparkling
eyes
you
are
really
too
kind
sir
mouret
who
took
a
personal
pleasure
in
satisfying
other
passions
sometimes
gave
lhomme
the
tickets
forced
upon
him
by
lady
patronesses
and
he
put
the
finishing
touch
to
the
old
man
delight
by
remarking
ah
beethoven
ah
mozart
what
music
then
without
waiting
for
a
reply
he
went
off
rejoining
bourdoncle
who
had
already
started
on
his
tour
of
inspection
through
the
departments
in
the
central
hall
an
inner
courtyard
with
a
glass
roof
was
the
silk
department
at
first
mouret
and
his
companion
turned
into
the
gallery
occupied
by
the
linen
department
from
one
end
to
the
other
nothing
unusual
striking
them
they
passed
on
slowly
through
the
crowd
of
respectful
assistants
next
they
turned
into
the
cotton
and
hosiery
departments
where
the
same
good
order
reigned
but
in
the
department
devoted
to
woollens
occupying
the
gallery
which
ran
towards
the
rue
de
la
michodière
bourdoncle
resumed
the
part
of
executioner
on
observing
a
young
man
seated
on
the
counter
looking
quite
knocked
up
by
a
sleepless
night
and
this
young
man
a
certain
liénard
son
of
a
rich
angers
draper
bowed
his
head
beneath
the
reprimand
for
in
the
idle
careless
life
of
pleasure
which
he
led
his
one
great
fear
was
that
he
might
be
recalled
from
paris
by
his
father
and
now
reprimands
began
to
shower
down
on
all
sides
like
hail
and
quite
a
storm
burst
in
the
gallery
of
the
rue
de
la
michodière
in
the
drapery
department
a
salesman
a
fresh
hand
who
slept
in
the
house
had
come
in
after
eleven
and
in
the
haberdashery
department
the
second
counterman
had
allowed
himself
to
be
caught
smoking
a
cigarette
downstairs
but
the
tempest
attained
its
greatest
violence
in
the
glove
department
where
it
fell
upon
one
of
the
few
parisians
in
the
house
handsome
mignot
as
he
was
called
the
illegitimate
son
of
a
his
crime
was
that
of
causing
a
scandal
in
the
by
complaining
of
the
food
as
there
were
three
tables
one
at
nine
one
at
ten
and
another
at
eleven
he
wished
to
explain
that
belonging
as
he
did
to
the
third
table
he
always
had
the
leavings
the
worst
of
everything
for
his
share
what
the
food
not
good
asked
mouret
with
a
naive
air
opening
his
mouth
at
last
he
only
allowed
the
chief
cook
a
terrible
auvergnat
a
franc
and
a
half
a
head
per
day
out
of
which
small
sum
this
man
still
contrived
to
make
a
good
profit
and
indeed
the
food
was
really
execrable
but
bourdoncle
shrugged
his
shoulders
a
cook
who
had
four
hundred
luncheons
and
four
hundred
dinners
to
serve
even
in
three
series
had
no
time
to
waste
on
the
refinements
of
his
art
never
mind
said
the
governor
i
wish
all
our
employees
to
have
good
and
abundant
food
i
speak
to
the
cook
and
thus
mignot
complaint
was
shelved
then
returning
to
their
point
of
departure
standing
near
the
door
amidst
the
umbrellas
and
neckties
mouret
and
bourdoncle
received
the
report
of
one
of
the
four
inspectors
who
were
charged
with
the
police
service
of
the
establishment
the
inspector
in
question
old
jouve
a
retired
captain
decorated
for
his
bravery
at
constantine
and
still
a
man
with
his
big
sensual
nose
and
majestic
baldness
drew
their
attention
to
a
salesman
who
in
reply
to
a
simple
remonstrance
on
his
part
had
called
him
an
old
humbug
and
the
salesman
was
immediately
discharged
meantime
the
shop
was
still
without
customers
that
is
except
a
few
housewives
of
the
neighbourhood
who
were
passing
through
the
almost
deserted
galleries
at
the
door
the
had
just
closed
his
book
and
was
making
out
a
separate
list
of
the
late
arrivals
the
salesmen
on
their
side
were
taking
possession
of
their
departments
which
had
been
swept
and
brushed
by
the
assistants
before
their
arrival
each
young
man
put
away
his
hat
and
as
he
arrived
stifling
a
yawn
still
half
asleep
as
he
did
so
some
exchanged
a
few
words
gazed
about
the
shop
and
sought
to
pull
themselves
together
for
another
day
work
while
others
leisurely
removed
the
green
baize
with
which
they
had
covered
the
goods
over
night
after
folding
them
up
then
the
piles
of
stuffs
appeared
symmetrically
arranged
and
the
whole
shop
looked
clean
and
orderly
brilliant
in
the
gay
morning
light
pending
the
rush
of
business
which
would
once
more
obstruct
it
and
as
it
were
reduce
its
dimensions
by
the
unpacking
and
display
of
linen
cloth
silk
and
lace
in
the
bright
light
of
the
central
hall
two
young
men
were
talking
in
a
low
voice
at
the
silk
counter
one
of
them
short
but
well
set
and
good
looking
with
a
pinky
skin
was
endeavouring
to
blend
the
colours
of
some
silks
for
an
indoor
show
his
name
was
hutin
his
father
kept
a
café
at
yvetot
and
after
eighteen
months
service
he
had
managed
to
become
one
of
the
principal
salesmen
thanks
to
a
natural
flexibility
of
character
and
a
continual
flow
of
caressing
flattery
under
which
were
concealed
furious
appetites
which
prompted
him
to
grasp
at
everything
and
devour
everybody
just
for
the
pleasure
of
the
thing
well
favier
i
should
have
struck
him
if
i
had
been
in
your
place
honour
bright
said
he
to
his
companion
a
tall
bilious
fellow
with
a
dry
yellow
skin
who
had
been
born
at
besançon
of
a
family
of
weavers
and
concealed
under
a
cold
graceless
exterior
a
disquieting
force
of
will
it
does
no
good
to
strike
people
he
murmured
phlegmatically
better
wait
they
were
both
speaking
of
robineau
the
second
in
the
department
who
was
looking
after
the
shopmen
during
the
manager
absence
in
the
basement
hutin
was
secretly
undermining
robineau
whose
place
he
coveted
to
wound
him
and
induce
him
to
leave
he
had
already
introduced
bouthemont
to
fill
the
post
of
manager
which
had
been
previously
promised
to
robineau
however
the
latter
stood
firm
and
it
was
now
an
hourly
battle
hutin
dreamed
of
setting
the
whole
department
against
him
of
hounding
him
out
by
dint
of
and
vexation
still
he
went
to
work
craftily
ever
preserving
his
amiable
air
and
it
was
especially
favier
whom
he
strove
to
excite
against
the
second
favier
who
stood
next
to
himself
as
salesman
and
who
appeared
willing
to
be
led
though
he
had
certain
brusque
fits
of
reserve
by
which
one
could
divine
that
he
was
bent
on
some
private
campaign
of
his
own
hush
seventeen
he
all
at
once
hastily
remarked
to
his
colleague
intending
by
this
peculiar
exclamation
to
warn
him
of
the
approach
of
mouret
and
bourdoncle
these
two
still
continuing
their
inspection
were
now
traversing
the
hall
and
stopped
to
ask
robineau
for
an
explanation
respecting
a
stock
of
velvets
the
boxes
of
which
were
encumbering
a
table
and
as
robineau
replied
that
there
was
enough
room
to
store
things
away
mouret
exclaimed
with
a
smile
ah
i
told
you
so
bourdoncle
the
place
is
already
too
small
we
shall
soon
have
to
knock
down
the
walls
as
far
as
the
rue
de
choiseul
you
see
what
a
crush
there
be
next
monday
then
respecting
the
coming
sale
for
which
they
were
preparing
at
every
counter
he
asked
further
questions
of
robineau
and
gave
him
various
orders
for
some
minutes
however
whilst
still
talking
he
had
been
watching
hutin
who
was
slowly
arranging
his
silks
placing
blue
grey
and
yellow
side
by
side
and
then
stepping
back
to
judge
of
the
harmony
of
the
tints
and
all
at
once
mouret
interfered
but
why
are
you
endeavouring
to
please
the
eye
he
asked
do
be
afraid
blind
the
customers
this
is
the
style
look
red
green
yellow
while
speaking
he
had
taken
up
some
of
the
pieces
of
silk
throwing
them
together
crumpling
them
and
producing
an
extremely
violent
effect
of
colour
every
one
allowed
the
governor
to
be
the
best
dresser
in
paris
albeit
one
of
a
revolutionary
stamp
an
initiator
of
the
brutal
and
the
colossal
in
the
science
of
display
his
fancy
was
a
tumbling
of
stuffs
heaped
as
if
they
had
fallen
by
chance
from
the
bursting
boxes
and
glowing
with
the
most
ardent
contrasting
colours
which
heightened
each
other
intensity
the
customers
said
he
ought
to
feel
their
eyes
aching
by
the
time
they
left
the
shop
hutin
who
on
the
contrary
belonged
to
the
classic
school
whose
guiding
principles
were
symmetry
and
a
melodious
blending
of
shades
watched
him
lighting
this
conflagration
of
silk
on
the
table
without
venturing
to
say
a
word
but
on
his
lips
appeared
the
pout
of
an
artist
whose
convictions
were
sorely
hurt
by
such
a
debauch
of
colour
there
exclaimed
mouret
when
he
had
finished
leave
it
as
it
is
you
see
if
it
does
fetch
the
women
on
monday
just
then
as
he
rejoined
bourdoncle
and
robineau
there
arrived
a
woman
who
stopped
short
breathless
at
sight
of
this
show
it
was
denise
who
after
waiting
for
nearly
an
hour
in
the
street
a
prey
to
a
violent
attack
of
timidity
had
at
last
decided
to
enter
but
she
was
so
beside
herself
with
bashfulness
that
she
mistook
the
clearest
directions
and
the
shopmen
of
whom
in
stammering
accents
she
asked
for
madame
aurélie
in
vain
directed
her
to
the
staircase
conducting
to
the
first
floor
she
thanked
them
but
turned
to
the
left
if
they
told
her
to
turn
to
the
right
so
that
for
the
last
ten
minutes
she
had
been
wandering
about
the
going
from
department
to
department
amidst
the
curiosity
and
boorish
indifference
of
the
salesmen
she
longed
to
run
away
but
was
at
the
same
time
retained
by
a
wish
to
stop
and
admire
she
felt
herself
lost
so
little
in
this
monstrous
place
this
machine
which
was
still
at
rest
and
trembled
with
fear
lest
she
should
be
caught
in
the
movement
with
which
the
walls
already
began
to
quiver
and
in
her
mind
the
thought
of
the
old
elbeuf
so
black
and
narrow
increased
the
immensity
of
this
vast
establishment
which
seemed
bathed
in
a
golden
light
and
similar
to
a
city
with
its
monuments
squares
and
streets
in
which
it
seemed
impossible
she
should
ever
find
her
way
however
she
had
previously
not
dared
to
venture
into
the
silk
hall
whose
high
glass
roof
luxurious
counters
and
aspect
frightened
her
then
when
she
did
venture
in
to
escape
the
shopmen
of
the
linen
department
who
were
grinning
at
her
she
stumbled
right
on
mouret
display
and
despite
her
bewilderment
the
woman
was
aroused
within
her
her
cheeks
suddenly
flushed
and
she
forgot
everything
in
looking
at
the
glow
of
this
conflagration
of
silk
hullo
said
hutin
in
favier
ear
there
the
drab
we
saw
on
the
place
gaillon
mouret
whilst
affecting
to
listen
to
bourdoncle
and
robineau
was
at
heart
flattered
by
the
startled
look
of
this
poor
girl
just
as
a
marchioness
might
be
by
the
brutal
admiration
of
a
passing
drayman
but
denise
had
raised
her
eyes
and
her
confusion
increased
at
the
sight
of
this
young
man
whom
she
took
for
the
manager
of
a
department
she
thought
he
was
looking
at
her
severely
then
not
knowing
how
to
get
away
quite
lost
she
once
more
applied
to
the
nearest
shopman
who
happened
to
be
favier
madame
aurélie
if
you
please
however
favier
who
was
disagreeable
contented
himself
with
replying
sharply
on
the
first
floor
then
denise
longing
to
escape
the
looks
of
all
these
men
thanked
him
and
was
again
turning
her
back
to
the
stairs
she
ought
to
have
ascended
when
hutin
yielding
naturally
to
his
instinctive
gallantry
stopped
her
with
his
most
amiable
salesman
smile
albeit
he
had
just
spoken
of
her
as
a
drab
no
this
way
mademoiselle
if
you
please
said
he
and
he
even
went
with
her
a
little
way
as
far
indeed
as
the
foot
of
the
staircase
on
the
side
of
the
hall
there
he
bowed
and
smiled
at
her
as
he
smiled
at
all
women
when
you
get
upstairs
turn
to
the
left
he
added
the
mantle
department
will
then
be
in
front
of
you
this
caressing
politeness
affected
denise
deeply
it
was
like
a
brotherly
hand
extended
to
her
she
raised
her
eyes
and
looked
at
hutin
and
everything
in
him
touched
her
his
handsome
face
his
smiling
look
which
dissolved
her
fears
and
his
voice
which
seemed
to
her
of
a
consoling
softness
her
heart
swelled
with
gratitude
and
she
gave
him
her
friendship
in
the
few
disjointed
words
which
her
emotion
allowed
her
to
utter
really
sir
you
are
too
kind
pray
do
trouble
to
come
any
further
thank
you
very
much
hutin
was
already
rejoining
favier
to
whom
he
coarsely
whispered
what
a
bag
of
bones
eh
upstairs
the
young
girl
suddenly
found
herself
in
the
midst
of
the
mantle
department
it
was
a
vast
room
with
high
carved
oak
cupboards
all
round
it
and
clear
glass
windows
overlooking
the
rue
de
la
michodière
five
or
six
women
in
silk
dresses
looking
very
coquettish
with
their
frizzy
chignons
and
crinolines
drawn
back
were
moving
about
and
talking
one
of
them
tall
and
thin
with
a
long
head
and
a
appearance
was
leaning
against
a
cupboard
as
if
already
knocked
up
with
fatigue
madame
aurélie
inquired
denise
the
saleswoman
did
not
reply
but
looked
at
her
with
an
air
of
disdain
for
her
shabby
dress
then
turning
to
one
of
her
companions
a
short
girl
with
a
sickly
white
skin
and
an
innocent
and
disgusted
expression
of
countenance
she
asked
mademoiselle
vadon
do
you
know
where
madame
aurélie
is
the
girl
who
was
arranging
some
mantles
according
to
their
sizes
did
not
even
take
the
trouble
to
raise
her
head
no
mademoiselle
prunaire
i
do
know
at
all
she
replied
in
a
mincing
tone
silence
fell
denise
stood
still
and
no
one
took
any
further
notice
of
her
however
after
waiting
a
moment
she
ventured
to
put
another
question
do
you
think
madame
aurélie
will
be
back
soon
thereupon
the
a
thin
ugly
woman
whom
she
had
not
noticed
before
a
widow
with
a
projecting
and
coarse
hair
cried
out
from
a
cupboard
board
where
she
was
checking
some
tickets
you
better
wait
if
you
want
to
speak
to
madame
aurélie
herself
and
addressing
another
saleswoman
she
added
is
she
downstairs
no
madame
frédéric
i
do
think
so
was
the
reply
she
said
nothing
before
going
so
she
ca
be
far
off
denise
thus
meagrely
informed
remained
standing
there
were
several
chairs
for
the
customers
but
as
she
had
not
been
asked
to
sit
down
she
did
not
dare
to
take
one
although
her
perturbation
well
nigh
deprived
her
legs
of
strength
all
these
young
ladies
had
evidently
guessed
that
she
was
an
applicant
for
the
vacancy
and
were
taking
stock
of
her
pulling
her
to
pieces
with
the
secret
hostility
of
people
at
table
who
do
not
like
to
close
up
to
make
room
for
hungry
outsiders
then
denise
confusion
increasing
she
slowly
crossed
the
room
and
looked
out
of
the
window
into
the
street
for
the
purpose
of
keeping
countenance
over
the
way
the
old
elbeuf
with
its
rusty
front
and
lifeless
windows
appeared
to
her
so
ugly
and
so
wretched
thus
viewed
from
amidst
the
luxury
and
life
of
her
present
standpoint
that
a
sort
of
remorse
filled
her
already
swollen
heart
with
grief
i
say
whispered
tall
mdlle
prunaire
to
little
mdlle
vadon
have
you
seen
her
boots
and
her
dress
murmured
the
other
with
her
eyes
still
turned
towards
the
street
denise
divined
that
she
was
being
devoured
but
she
was
not
angry
she
did
not
think
them
handsome
neither
the
tall
one
with
her
carroty
chignon
falling
over
her
neck
nor
the
little
one
with
her
complexion
which
gave
her
flat
and
as
it
were
boneless
face
a
flabby
appearance
clara
prunaire
daughter
of
a
clogmaker
of
the
woods
of
vivet
had
begun
to
misconduct
herself
at
the
time
when
she
was
employed
as
needlewoman
at
the
château
de
mareuil
later
on
she
had
come
to
paris
from
a
shop
at
langres
and
was
avenging
herself
in
the
capital
for
all
the
kicks
with
which
her
father
had
regaled
her
when
at
home
on
the
other
hand
marguerite
vadon
born
at
grenoble
where
her
parents
kept
a
linen
shop
had
been
obliged
to
come
to
paris
where
she
had
entered
the
ladies
paradise
in
order
to
conceal
a
misfortune
due
to
her
frailty
since
then
however
she
had
ever
been
a
girl
and
intended
to
return
to
grenoble
to
take
charge
of
her
shop
and
marry
a
cousin
who
was
waiting
for
her
ah
well
resumed
clara
in
a
low
voice
that
girl
wo
be
of
much
account
here
even
if
she
does
get
in
but
they
all
at
once
stopped
talking
for
a
woman
of
about
was
coming
in
it
was
madame
aurélie
very
stout
and
tightly
laced
in
her
black
silk
dress
the
body
of
which
strained
over
her
massive
shoulders
and
full
bust
shone
like
a
piece
of
armour
under
dark
folds
of
hair
she
had
big
fixed
eyes
a
severe
mouth
and
broad
and
rather
drooping
cheeks
and
in
the
majesty
of
her
position
as
manageress
her
face
seemed
to
swell
with
pride
like
the
puffy
countenance
of
a
cæsar
mademoiselle
vadon
said
she
in
an
irritated
voice
you
return
the
pattern
of
that
mantle
to
the
workroom
yesterday
it
seems
there
was
an
alteration
to
be
made
madame
replied
the
saleswoman
so
madame
frédéric
kept
it
the
thereupon
took
the
pattern
out
of
a
cupboard
and
the
explanation
continued
every
one
gave
way
to
madame
aurélie
when
she
thought
it
expedient
to
assert
her
authority
very
vain
even
to
the
point
of
objecting
to
be
called
by
her
husband
name
lhomme
which
annoyed
her
and
of
denying
the
humble
position
of
her
father
to
whom
she
always
referred
as
a
regularly
established
tailor
she
only
proved
gracious
towards
those
young
ladies
who
showed
themselves
flexible
and
caressing
and
bowed
down
in
admiration
before
her
formerly
whilst
trying
to
establish
herself
in
a
shop
of
her
own
her
temper
had
been
soured
by
continual
bad
luck
the
feeling
that
she
was
born
to
fortune
and
encountered
nothing
but
a
series
of
catastrophes
had
exasperated
her
and
now
even
after
her
success
at
the
ladies
paradise
where
she
earned
twelve
thousand
francs
a
year
it
seemed
as
if
she
still
nourished
a
secret
spite
against
every
one
she
was
in
particular
very
hard
with
beginners
even
as
life
had
shown
itself
hard
for
her
at
first
that
will
do
said
she
sharply
you
are
not
more
reasonable
than
the
others
madame
frédéric
let
the
alteration
be
made
immediately
during
this
explanation
denise
had
ceased
looking
into
the
street
she
had
no
doubt
this
was
madame
aurélie
but
frightened
by
her
sharp
voice
she
remained
standing
still
waiting
the
two
saleswomen
delighted
to
have
set
their
two
superiors
at
variance
had
returned
to
their
work
with
an
air
of
profound
indifference
a
few
minutes
elapsed
nobody
being
charitable
enough
to
extricate
the
young
girl
from
her
uncomfortable
position
at
last
madame
aurélie
herself
perceived
her
and
astonished
to
see
her
standing
there
motionless
inquired
what
she
wanted
madame
aurélie
please
i
am
madame
aurélie
denise
mouth
was
dry
and
parched
her
hands
were
cold
she
felt
some
such
fear
as
when
she
was
a
child
and
trembled
at
the
thought
of
being
whipped
at
last
she
stammered
out
her
request
but
was
obliged
to
repeat
it
to
make
herself
understood
madame
aurélie
gazed
upon
her
with
her
large
fixed
eyes
not
a
line
of
her
imperial
countenance
deigning
to
relax
how
old
are
you
she
eventually
inquired
twenty
madame
what
twenty
years
old
you
do
look
sixteen
the
saleswomen
again
raised
their
heads
denise
hastened
to
add
oh
i
very
strong
madame
aurélie
shrugged
her
broad
shoulders
and
then
coldly
remarked
well
i
do
mind
entering
your
name
we
enter
the
names
of
all
who
apply
mademoiselle
prunaire
give
me
the
book
but
the
book
could
not
be
found
jouve
the
inspector
had
probably
got
it
and
just
as
tall
clara
was
about
to
fetch
it
mouret
arrived
still
followed
by
bourdoncle
they
had
made
the
tour
of
the
other
departments
on
the
first
floor
they
had
passed
through
the
lace
the
shawls
the
furs
the
furniture
and
the
and
were
now
winding
up
with
the
mantles
madame
aurélie
left
denise
for
a
moment
to
speak
to
them
about
an
order
for
some
cloaks
which
she
thought
of
giving
to
one
of
the
large
paris
houses
as
a
rule
she
bought
direct
and
on
her
own
responsibility
but
for
important
purchases
she
preferred
to
consult
the
chiefs
of
the
house
bourdoncle
then
told
her
of
her
son
latest
act
of
carelessness
which
seemed
to
fill
her
with
despair
that
boy
would
kill
her
his
father
although
not
a
man
of
talent
was
at
least
careful
and
honest
all
this
dynasty
of
the
lhommes
of
which
she
was
the
acknowledged
head
very
often
caused
her
a
great
deal
of
trouble
however
mouret
surprised
to
come
upon
denise
again
bent
down
to
ask
madame
aurélie
what
that
young
person
was
doing
there
and
when
the
replied
that
she
was
applying
for
a
saleswoman
situation
bourdoncle
with
his
disdain
for
women
seemed
suffocated
by
such
pretension
you
do
mean
it
he
murmured
it
must
be
a
joke
she
too
ugly
the
fact
is
there
nothing
handsome
about
her
replied
mouret
not
daring
to
defend
her
although
he
was
still
moved
by
the
rapture
she
had
displayed
downstairs
before
his
arrangement
of
the
silks
however
the
book
having
been
brought
madame
aurélie
returned
to
denise
who
had
certainly
not
made
a
favourable
impression
she
looked
very
clean
in
her
thin
black
woollen
dress
still
the
question
of
shabbiness
was
of
no
importance
as
the
house
furnished
a
uniform
the
regulation
silk
dress
but
she
appeared
weak
and
puny
and
had
a
melancholy
face
without
insisting
on
handsome
girls
the
managers
of
the
house
liked
their
assistants
to
be
of
agreeable
appearance
and
beneath
the
gaze
of
all
the
men
and
women
who
were
studying
her
estimating
her
like
farmers
would
a
horse
at
a
fair
denise
lost
what
little
countenance
had
still
remained
to
her
your
name
asked
madame
aurélie
standing
at
the
end
of
a
counter
pen
in
hand
ready
to
write
denise
baudu
madame
your
age
twenty
years
and
four
months
and
risking
a
glance
at
mouret
at
this
supposed
manager
whom
she
met
everywhere
and
whose
presence
troubled
her
so
much
she
repeated
i
do
look
like
it
but
i
am
really
very
strong
they
smiled
bourdoncle
showed
evident
signs
of
impatience
her
remark
fell
moreover
amidst
a
most
discouraging
silence
what
establishment
have
you
been
at
in
paris
resumed
madame
aurélie
i
just
arrived
from
valognes
madame
this
was
a
fresh
disaster
as
a
rule
the
ladies
paradise
only
engaged
as
saleswomen
such
girls
as
had
had
a
year
experience
in
one
of
the
small
houses
in
paris
denise
thought
all
was
lost
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
children
had
she
not
been
obliged
to
work
for
them
she
would
have
brought
this
futile
interrogatory
to
an
end
by
leaving
the
place
where
were
you
at
valognes
asked
madame
aurélie
at
cornaille
i
know
him
good
house
remarked
mouret
it
was
very
seldom
that
he
interfered
in
the
engagement
of
the
employees
the
manager
of
each
department
being
responsible
for
his
or
her
staff
but
with
his
fine
appreciation
of
women
he
divined
in
this
girl
a
hidden
charm
a
wealth
of
grace
and
tenderness
of
which
she
herself
was
ignorant
the
good
reputation
of
the
establishment
in
which
the
candidate
had
started
was
of
great
importance
often
deciding
the
question
in
his
or
her
favour
thus
even
madame
aurélie
continued
in
a
kinder
tone
and
why
did
you
leave
cornaille
for
family
reasons
replied
denise
turning
scarlet
we
have
lost
our
parents
i
have
been
obliged
to
follow
my
brothers
here
is
a
certificate
it
was
excellent
her
hopes
were
reviving
when
another
question
troubled
her
have
you
any
other
references
in
paris
where
do
you
live
at
my
uncle
she
murmured
hesitating
to
name
him
for
she
feared
that
they
would
never
engage
the
niece
of
a
competitor
at
my
uncle
baudu
opposite
at
this
mouret
interfered
a
second
time
what
are
you
niece
said
he
is
it
baudu
who
sent
you
here
oh
no
sir
answered
denise
and
she
could
not
help
laughing
as
she
spoke
for
the
idea
appeared
to
her
so
singular
that
laugh
was
like
a
transfiguration
she
became
quite
rosy
and
the
smile
playing
round
her
rather
large
mouth
lighted
up
her
whole
face
her
grey
eyes
sparkled
with
a
soft
flame
her
cheeks
filled
with
delicious
dimples
and
even
her
light
hair
seemed
to
partake
of
the
frank
and
courageous
gaiety
that
pervaded
her
whole
being
why
she
really
pretty
whispered
mouret
to
bourdoncle
the
latter
with
a
gesture
of
boredom
refused
to
admit
it
clara
on
her
side
bit
her
lips
and
marguerite
turned
away
madame
aurélie
alone
seemed
won
over
and
encouraged
mouret
with
a
nod
when
he
resumed
your
uncle
was
wrong
not
to
bring
you
here
his
recommendation
sufficed
it
is
said
he
has
a
grudge
against
us
we
are
people
of
more
liberal
minds
and
if
he
ca
find
employment
for
his
niece
in
his
house
why
we
will
show
him
that
she
has
only
had
to
knock
at
our
door
to
be
received
just
tell
him
i
still
like
him
very
much
and
that
if
he
has
cause
for
complaint
he
must
blame
not
me
but
the
new
circumstances
of
commerce
tell
him
too
that
he
will
ruin
himself
if
he
insists
on
keeping
to
his
ridiculous
ways
denise
turned
quite
white
again
it
was
mouret
no
one
had
mentioned
his
name
but
he
revealed
himself
and
she
guessed
who
he
was
and
understood
why
the
sight
of
him
had
caused
her
such
emotion
in
the
street
in
the
silk
department
and
again
here
this
emotion
which
she
could
not
analyze
pressed
more
and
more
upon
her
heart
like
an
unbearable
weight
all
the
stories
related
by
her
uncle
came
back
to
her
increasing
mouret
importance
in
her
eyes
surrounding
him
with
a
sort
of
halo
in
his
capacity
as
the
master
of
the
terrible
machine
between
whose
wheels
she
had
felt
herself
all
the
morning
and
behind
his
handsome
face
with
its
beard
and
eyes
the
colour
of
old
gold
she
beheld
the
dead
woman
that
madame
hédouin
whose
blood
had
helped
to
cement
the
stones
of
the
house
the
shiver
she
had
felt
the
previous
night
again
came
upon
her
and
she
thought
she
was
merely
afraid
of
him
however
madame
aurélie
had
closed
the
book
she
only
wanted
one
saleswoman
and
she
already
had
ten
applications
true
she
was
too
anxious
to
please
the
governor
to
hesitate
for
a
moment
still
the
application
would
follow
its
course
inspector
jouve
would
go
and
make
inquiries
send
in
his
report
and
then
she
would
come
to
a
decision
very
good
mademoiselle
said
she
majestically
as
though
to
preserve
her
authority
we
will
write
to
you
denise
stood
there
unable
to
move
for
a
moment
hardly
knowing
how
to
take
her
leave
in
the
midst
of
all
these
people
at
last
she
thanked
madame
aurélie
and
on
passing
mouret
and
bourdoncle
she
bowed
the
gentlemen
however
were
examining
the
pattern
of
a
mantle
with
madame
frédéric
and
took
no
further
notice
of
her
clara
looked
in
a
vexed
way
towards
marguerite
as
if
to
predict
that
the
would
not
have
a
very
pleasant
time
of
it
in
the
establishment
denise
doubtless
felt
this
indifference
and
rancour
behind
her
for
she
went
downstairs
with
the
same
troubled
feeling
that
had
possessed
her
on
going
up
asking
herself
whether
she
ought
to
be
sorry
or
glad
at
having
come
could
she
count
on
having
the
situation
she
doubted
it
amidst
the
uneasiness
which
had
prevented
her
from
clearly
understanding
what
had
been
said
of
her
various
sensations
two
remained
and
gradually
effaced
all
others
the
emotion
almost
fear
with
which
mouret
had
inspired
her
and
the
pleasure
she
had
derived
from
the
amiability
of
hutin
the
only
pleasure
she
had
enjoyed
the
whole
morning
a
souvenir
of
charming
sweetness
which
filled
her
with
gratitude
when
she
crossed
the
shop
on
her
way
out
she
looked
for
the
young
man
happy
in
the
idea
of
thanking
him
again
with
her
eyes
and
she
was
very
sorry
not
to
see
him
well
mademoiselle
have
you
succeeded
inquired
a
timid
voice
as
she
at
last
reached
the
pavement
she
turned
round
and
recognised
the
tall
awkward
young
fellow
who
had
spoken
to
her
in
the
morning
he
also
had
just
come
out
of
the
ladies
paradise
and
seemed
even
more
frightened
than
herself
still
bewildered
by
the
examination
through
which
he
had
just
passed
i
really
do
know
as
yet
sir
she
replied
you
like
me
then
what
a
way
they
have
of
looking
at
you
and
talking
to
you
in
there
eh
i
applying
for
a
place
in
the
lace
department
i
was
at
crevecœur
in
the
rue
du
mail
they
were
once
more
standing
face
to
face
and
not
knowing
how
to
take
leave
they
again
began
to
blush
then
the
young
man
by
way
of
saying
something
timidly
ventured
to
ask
in
his
awkward
way
what
is
your
name
mademoiselle
denise
baudu
my
name
is
henri
deloche
then
they
smiled
and
yielding
to
a
fraternal
feeling
born
of
the
similarity
of
their
positions
shook
each
other
by
the
hand
good
luck
said
deloche
yes
good
luck
was
denise

chapter
iii
every
saturday
between
four
and
six
madame
desforges
offered
a
cup
of
tea
and
a
few
sweet
biscuits
to
those
friends
who
were
kind
enough
to
visit
her
she
occupied
the
third
floor
of
a
house
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
rivoli
and
the
rue
and
the
windows
of
her
two
overlooked
the
gardens
of
the
tuileries
that
saturday
just
as
a
footman
was
about
to
introduce
him
into
the
principal
mouret
from
the
anteroom
perceived
through
an
open
doorway
madame
desforges
crossing
the
smaller
salon
she
stopped
on
seeing
him
and
he
went
in
that
way
bowing
to
her
with
a
ceremonious
air
but
when
the
footman
had
closed
the
door
he
quickly
caught
hold
of
the
young
woman
hand
and
tenderly
kissed
it
take
care
i
have
company
she
remarked
in
a
low
voice
glancing
towards
the
door
of
the
larger
room
i
just
come
to
fetch
this
fan
to
show
them
and
so
saying
she
playfully
tapped
him
on
the
face
with
the
tip
of
the
fan
she
held
she
was
dark
and
inclined
to
stoutness
and
had
big
jealous
eyes
however
he
still
held
her
hand
and
inquired
will
he
come
certainly
she
replied
i
have
his
promise
they
both
referred
to
baron
hartmann
the
director
of
the
crédit
immobilier
madame
desforges
daughter
of
a
councillor
of
state
was
the
widow
of
a
speculator
who
had
left
her
a
fortune
underrated
to
the
point
of
nothingness
by
some
and
greatly
by
others
during
her
husband
lifetime
she
had
already
known
baron
hartmann
whose
financial
tips
had
proved
very
useful
to
them
and
later
on
after
her
husband
death
the
connection
had
been
kept
up
in
a
discreet
fashion
for
she
never
courted
notoriety
in
any
way
and
was
received
everywhere
in
the
class
to
which
she
belonged
even
now
too
when
she
had
other
lovers
the
passion
of
the
banker
a
sceptical
crafty
man
having
subsided
into
a
mere
paternal
affection
she
displayed
such
delicate
reserve
and
tact
such
adroit
knowledge
of
the
world
that
appearances
were
saved
and
no
one
would
have
ventured
to
openly
express
any
doubt
of
her
conduct
having
met
mouret
at
a
mutual
friend
she
had
at
first
detested
him
but
had
been
carried
away
by
the
violent
love
which
he
professed
for
her
and
since
he
had
begun
manœuvring
to
approach
baron
hartmann
through
her
she
had
gradually
got
to
love
him
with
real
and
profound
tenderness
adoring
him
with
all
the
violence
of
a
woman
of
who
only
acknowledged
the
age
of
and
distressed
at
feeling
him
younger
than
herself
which
made
her
tremble
lest
she
should
lose
him
does
he
know
about
it
he
resumed
no
you
explain
the
affair
to
him
yourself
was
her
reply
meantime
she
looked
at
him
reflecting
that
he
could
know
anything
or
he
would
not
employ
her
in
this
way
with
the
baron
whom
he
appeared
to
consider
simply
as
an
old
friend
of
hers
however
mouret
still
held
her
hand
and
called
her
his
good
henriette
at
which
she
felt
her
heart
melting
then
silently
she
presented
her
lips
pressed
them
to
his
and
whispered
remember
they
waiting
for
me
come
in
behind
me
a
murmur
of
voices
deadened
by
the
heavy
hangings
came
from
the
principal
madame
desforges
went
in
leaving
the
folding
doors
open
behind
her
and
handed
the
fan
to
one
of
the
four
ladies
who
were
seated
in
the
middle
of
the
room
there
it
is
said
she
i
did
know
exactly
where
it
was
my
maid
would
never
have
found
it
and
turning
round
she
added
in
her
cheerful
way
come
in
monsieur
mouret
come
through
the
little
it
will
be
less
solemn
mouret
bowed
to
the
ladies
whom
he
knew
the
with
its
louis
xvi
furniture
upholstered
in
flowered
brocatel
its
gilded
bronzes
and
large
green
plants
had
a
pleasant
cozy
feminine
aspect
albeit
the
ceiling
was
so
lofty
and
through
the
two
windows
could
be
seen
the
chestnut
trees
of
the
tuileries
gardens
whose
leaves
were
blowing
about
in
the
october
wind
but
this
chantilly
is
at
all
bad
exclaimed
madam
bourdelais
who
had
taken
the
fan
she
was
a
short
fair
woman
of
thirty
with
a
delicate
nose
and
sparkling
eyes
a
former
of
henriette
married
to
a
chief
clerk
at
the
ministry
of
finances
and
belonging
to
an
old
family
she
managed
her
household
and
three
children
with
rare
activity
good
grace
and
exquisite
knowledge
of
practical
life
and
you
paid
francs
for
it
she
resumed
examining
each
mesh
of
the
lace
at
luc
i
think
you
said
to
a
no
it
is
dear
still
you
had
to
get
it
mounted
had
you
of
course
replied
madame
desforges
the
mounting
cost
me
two
hundred
francs
madame
bourdelais
began
to
laugh
and
that
was
what
henriette
called
a
bargain
two
hundred
francs
for
a
plain
ivory
mount
with
a
monogram
and
that
for
a
mere
piece
of
chantilly
over
which
she
had
perhaps
saved
five
francs
similar
fans
could
be
had
ready
mounted
for
a
hundred
and
twenty
francs
and
she
named
a
shop
in
the
rue
poissonnière
where
she
had
seen
them
however
the
fan
was
handed
round
to
all
the
ladies
madame
guibal
barely
glanced
at
it
she
was
a
tall
slim
woman
with
red
hair
and
a
face
full
of
indifference
in
which
her
grey
eyes
belying
her
unconcerned
air
occasionally
cast
a
hungry
gleam
of
selfishness
she
was
never
seen
out
with
her
husband
a
barrister
at
the
palais
de
justice
who
led
it
was
said
a
pretty
free
life
between
his
briefs
and
his
pleasures
oh
she
murmured
passing
the
fan
to
madame
de
boves
i
scarcely
bought
one
in
my
life
one
always
receives
too
many
of
such
things
you
are
fortunate
my
dear
in
having
a
gallant
husband
answered
the
countess
in
a
tone
of
delicate
irony
and
bending
over
to
her
daughter
a
tall
girl
of
twenty
she
added
just
look
at
the
monogram
blanche
what
pretty
work
it
the
monogram
that
must
have
increased
the
price
of
the
mounting
like
that
madame
de
boves
had
just
turned
forty
she
was
a
superb
woman
with
the
neck
and
shoulders
of
a
goddess
a
large
regular
face
and
big
sleepy
eyes
her
husband
an
of
the
state
studs
had
married
her
for
her
beauty
she
appeared
quite
moved
by
the
delicacy
of
the
monogram
seized
indeed
by
a
desire
which
so
stirred
her
as
to
make
her
turn
pale
and
suddenly
turning
she
continued
give
us
your
opinion
monsieur
mouret
is
it
too
dear
two
hundred
francs
for
this
mount
mouret
had
remained
standing
among
the
five
women
smiling
and
affecting
an
interest
in
what
interested
them
he
took
the
fan
examined
it
and
was
about
to
give
his
opinion
when
the
footman
opened
the
door
and
announced
madame
marty
there
then
entered
a
thin
ugly
woman
disfigured
by
but
dressed
with
elaborate
elegance
she
seemed
of
uncertain
age
her
years
sometimes
appearing
equal
to
thirty
and
sometimes
to
forty
according
to
the
intensity
of
the
nervous
fever
which
so
often
agitated
her
a
red
leather
bag
which
she
had
not
been
willing
to
leave
in
the
anteroom
hung
from
her
right
hand
dear
madame
said
she
to
henriette
you
will
excuse
me
bringing
my
bag
just
fancy
as
i
was
coming
along
i
went
into
the
paradise
and
as
i
have
again
been
very
extravagant
i
did
not
like
to
leave
it
in
my
cab
for
fear
of
being
robbed
then
having
perceived
mouret
she
resumed
laughing
ah
sir
i
did
mean
to
give
you
an
advertisement
for
i
did
know
you
were
here
but
you
really
have
some
extraordinarily
fine
lace
just
now
this
turned
the
attention
from
the
fan
which
the
young
man
laid
on
the
table
the
ladies
were
now
all
anxious
to
see
what
madame
marty
had
bought
she
was
known
to
be
very
extravagant
totally
unable
to
resist
certain
temptations
strict
in
her
conduct
incapable
of
any
sexual
transgression
she
proved
weak
and
cowardly
before
the
least
bit
of
finery
daughter
of
a
clerk
of
small
means
she
was
ruining
her
husband
the
professor
at
the
lycée
bonaparte
who
in
order
to
meet
the
constantly
increasing
expenses
of
the
household
was
compelled
to
double
his
income
of
six
thousand
francs
by
giving
private
lessons
however
she
did
not
open
her
bag
but
held
it
tightly
on
her
lap
and
began
to
talk
about
her
daughter
valentine
a
girl
of
fourteen
whom
she
dressed
like
herself
in
all
the
fashionable
novelties
to
whose
irresistible
fascination
she
succumbed
you
know
said
she
they
are
making
girls
dresses
trimmed
with
narrow
lace
this
winter
so
when
i
saw
a
very
pretty
valenciennes
thereupon
she
at
last
decided
to
open
her
bag
and
the
ladies
were
craning
their
necks
when
amidst
the
silence
the
was
heard
it
my
husband
stammered
madame
marty
in
great
confusion
he
promised
to
call
for
me
on
leaving
the
lycée
bonaparte
forthwith
she
shut
her
bag
again
and
instinctively
hid
it
away
under
her
chair
all
the
ladies
set
up
a
laugh
this
made
her
blush
for
her
precipitation
and
she
took
the
bag
on
her
knees
again
explaining
however
that
men
never
understood
matters
and
that
they
need
not
know
everything
monsieur
de
boves
monsieur
de
vallagnosc
announced
the
footman
it
was
quite
a
surprise
madame
de
boves
herself
did
not
expect
her
husband
the
latter
a
fine
man
wearing
a
moustache
and
an
imperial
in
the
correct
military
fashion
so
much
liked
at
the
tuileries
kissed
the
hand
of
madame
desforges
whom
he
had
known
as
a
young
girl
at
her
father
and
then
he
made
way
so
that
his
companion
a
tall
pale
fellow
of
an
aristocratic
poverty
of
blood
might
in
his
turn
make
his
bow
to
the
lady
of
the
house
however
the
conversation
had
hardly
been
resumed
when
two
exclamations
rang
out
what
is
that
you
paul
why
octave
mouret
and
vallagnosc
thereupon
shook
hands
much
to
madame
surprise
they
knew
each
other
then
of
course
they
had
grown
up
side
by
side
at
the
college
at
plassans
and
it
was
quite
by
chance
they
had
not
met
at
her
house
before
however
jesting
together
and
with
their
hands
still
united
they
stepped
into
the
little
just
as
the
servant
brought
in
the
tea
a
china
service
on
a
silver
waiter
which
he
placed
near
madame
desforges
on
a
small
round
marble
table
with
a
light
brass
mounting
the
ladies
drew
up
and
began
talking
in
louder
tones
raising
a
of
endless
chatter
whilst
monsieur
de
boves
standing
behind
them
leant
over
every
now
and
then
to
put
in
a
word
or
two
with
the
gallantry
of
a
handsome
functionary
the
spacious
room
so
prettily
and
cheerfully
furnished
became
merrier
still
with
these
gossiping
voices
interspersed
with
laughter
ah
paul
old
boy
repeated
mouret
he
was
seated
near
vallagnosc
on
a
sofa
and
alone
in
the
little
which
looked
very
coquettish
with
its
hangings
of
buttercup
silk
out
of
hearing
of
the
ladies
and
not
even
seeing
them
except
through
the
open
doorway
the
two
old
friends
commenced
grinning
whilst
they
scrutinized
each
other
and
exchanged
slaps
on
the
knees
their
whole
youthful
career
was
recalled
the
old
college
at
plassans
with
its
two
courtyards
its
damp
and
the
in
which
they
had
consumed
so
much
and
the
dormitories
where
the
pillows
flew
from
bed
to
bed
as
soon
as
the
monitor
began
to
snore
paul
who
belonged
to
an
old
parliamentary
family
noble
poor
and
proud
had
proved
a
good
scholar
always
at
the
top
of
his
class
and
continually
held
up
as
an
example
by
the
master
who
prophesied
a
brilliant
future
for
him
whereas
octave
had
remained
at
the
bottom
amongst
the
dunces
but
nevertheless
fat
and
jolly
indulging
in
all
sorts
of
pleasures
outside
notwithstanding
the
difference
in
their
characters
a
fast
friendship
had
rendered
them
inseparable
until
they
were
examined
for
their
bachelor
degrees
which
they
took
the
one
with
honours
the
other
in
just
a
passable
manner
after
two
vexatious
rebuffs
then
they
went
out
into
the
world
each
on
his
own
side
and
had
now
met
again
after
the
lapse
of
ten
years
already
changed
and
looking
older
well
asked
mouret
what
become
of
you
nothing
at
all
replied
the
other
vallagnosc
indeed
despite
the
pleasure
of
this
meeting
retained
a
tired
and
disenchanted
air
and
as
his
friend
somewhat
astonished
insisted
saying
but
you
must
do
something
what
do
you
do
he
merely
replied
nothing
octave
began
to
laugh
nothing
that
was
enough
little
by
little
however
he
succeeded
in
learning
paul
story
it
was
the
usual
story
of
penniless
young
men
who
think
themselves
obliged
by
their
birth
to
choose
a
liberal
profession
and
bury
themselves
in
a
sort
of
vain
mediocrity
happy
even
when
they
escape
starvation
notwithstanding
their
numerous
degrees
for
his
part
he
had
studied
law
by
a
sort
of
family
tradition
and
had
then
remained
a
burden
on
his
widowed
mother
who
already
hardly
knew
how
to
dispose
of
her
two
daughters
having
at
last
got
quite
ashamed
of
his
position
he
had
left
the
three
women
to
vegetate
on
the
remnants
of
their
fortune
and
had
accepted
a
petty
appointment
at
the
ministry
of
the
interior
where
he
buried
himself
like
a
mole
in
his
hole
what
do
you
get
there
resumed
mouret
three
thousand
francs
but
that
pitiful
pay
ah
old
man
i
really
sorry
for
you
what
a
clever
fellow
like
you
who
floored
all
of
us
and
they
only
give
you
three
thousand
francs
a
year
after
having
already
ground
you
down
for
five
years
no
it
is
right
he
paused
and
then
thinking
of
his
own
good
fortune
resumed
as
for
me
i
made
them
a
humble
bow
long
ago
you
know
what
i
doing
yes
said
vallagnosc
i
heard
you
were
in
business
you
got
that
big
place
on
the
place
gaillon
have
you
that
it
my
boy
mouret
raised
his
head
again
slapped
his
friend
on
the
knee
and
repeated
with
the
sterling
gaiety
of
a
man
who
did
not
blush
for
the
trade
by
which
he
was
making
his
fortune
and
no
mistake
you
remember
no
doubt
i
nibble
much
at
their
baits
although
at
heart
i
never
thought
myself
a
bigger
fool
than
the
others
when
i
took
my
degree
just
to
please
the
family
i
could
have
become
a
barrister
or
a
doctor
quite
as
easily
as
any
of
my
but
those
trades
frightened
me
for
one
sees
so
many
chaps
starving
at
them
so
i
just
threw
the
skin
away
oh
without
the
least
regret
and
plunged
into
business
vallagnosc
smiled
with
an
awkward
air
and
ultimately
muttered
quite
certain
that
your
degree
ca
be
of
much
use
to
you
in
selling
linen
well
replied
mouret
joyously
all
i
ask
is
that
it
stand
in
my
way
and
you
know
when
one
has
been
stupid
enough
to
burden
one
self
with
such
a
thing
it
is
difficult
to
get
rid
of
it
one
goes
at
a
tortoise
pace
through
life
whilst
those
who
are
run
like
madmen
then
noticing
that
his
friend
seemed
troubled
he
took
his
hand
in
his
and
continued
come
come
i
want
to
hurt
your
feelings
but
confess
that
your
degrees
have
not
satisfied
any
of
your
wants
do
you
know
that
my
manager
in
the
silk
department
will
draw
more
than
twelve
thousand
francs
this
year
just
so
a
fellow
of
very
clear
intelligence
whose
knowledge
is
confined
to
spelling
and
the
first
four
rules
of
arithmetic
the
ordinary
salesmen
in
my
place
make
from
three
to
four
thousand
francs
a
year
more
than
you
can
earn
yourself
and
their
education
did
not
cost
anything
like
what
yours
did
nor
were
they
launched
into
the
world
with
a
written
promise
to
conquer
it
of
course
it
is
not
everything
to
make
money
only
between
the
poor
devils
possessed
of
a
smattering
of
science
who
now
block
up
the
liberal
professions
without
earning
enough
to
keep
themselves
from
starving
and
the
practical
fellows
armed
for
struggle
knowing
every
branch
of
their
trade
i
do
hesitate
one
moment
i
for
the
latter
against
the
former
i
think
they
thoroughly
understand
the
age
they
live
in
his
voice
had
become
impassioned
and
henriette
who
was
pouring
out
the
tea
turned
her
head
when
he
caught
her
smile
at
the
further
end
of
the
large
and
saw
two
other
ladies
listening
he
was
the
first
to
make
merry
over
his
own
big
phrases
in
short
old
man
every
who
commences
has
at
the
present
day
a
chance
of
becoming
a
millionaire
vallagnosc
indolently
threw
himself
back
on
the
sofa
his
eyes
and
assuming
an
attitude
of
mingled
fatigue
and
disdain
in
which
a
dash
of
affectation
was
added
to
his
real
hereditary
exhaustion
bah
murmured
he
life
is
worth
all
that
trouble
there
is
nothing
worth
living
for
and
as
mouret
quite
shocked
looked
at
him
with
an
air
of
surprise
he
added
everything
happens
and
nothing
happens
a
man
may
as
well
remain
with
his
arms
folded
he
then
explained
his
pessimism
the
mediocrities
and
the
abortions
of
existence
for
a
time
he
had
thought
of
literature
but
his
intercourse
with
certain
poets
had
filled
him
with
unlimited
despair
he
always
came
to
the
conclusion
that
every
effort
was
futile
every
hour
equally
weary
and
empty
and
the
world
incurably
stupid
and
dull
all
enjoyment
was
a
failure
there
was
even
no
pleasure
in
just
tell
me
do
you
enjoy
life
yourself
asked
he
at
last
mouret
was
now
in
a
state
of
astonished
indignation
and
exclaimed
what
do
i
enjoy
myself
what
are
you
talking
about
why
of
course
i
do
my
boy
and
even
when
things
give
way
for
then
i
am
furious
at
hearing
them
cracking
i
am
a
passionate
fellow
myself
and
take
life
quietly
that
what
interests
me
in
it
perhaps
he
glanced
towards
the
and
lowered
his
voice
oh
there
are
some
women
who
bothered
me
awfully
i
must
confess
still
i
have
my
revenge
i
assure
you
but
it
is
not
so
much
the
women
for
to
speak
truly
i
do
care
a
hang
for
them
the
great
thing
in
life
is
to
be
able
to
will
and
do
to
create
in
short
you
have
an
idea
you
fight
for
it
you
hammer
it
into
people
heads
and
you
see
it
grow
and
triumph
ah
yes
my
boy
i
enjoy
life
all
the
joy
of
action
all
the
gaiety
of
existence
resounded
in
mouret
words
he
repeated
that
he
went
with
the
times
really
a
man
must
be
badly
constituted
have
his
brain
and
limbs
out
of
order
to
refuse
to
work
in
an
age
of
such
vast
undertakings
when
the
entire
century
was
pressing
forward
with
giant
strides
and
he
railed
at
the
despairing
ones
the
disgusted
ones
the
pessimists
all
those
weak
sickly
offsprings
of
our
budding
sciences
who
assumed
the
lachrymose
airs
of
poets
or
the
affected
countenances
of
sceptics
amidst
the
immense
activity
of
the
present
day
was
a
fine
part
to
play
decent
and
intelligent
that
of
yawning
before
other
people
labour
but
yawning
in
other
people
faces
is
my
only
pleasure
said
vallagnosc
smiling
in
his
cold
way
at
this
mouret
passion
subsided
and
he
became
affectionate
again
ah
paul
you
not
changed
just
as
paradoxical
as
ever
however
we
not
met
to
quarrel
each
man
has
his
own
ideas
fortunately
but
you
must
come
and
see
my
machine
at
work
you
see
it
is
a
bad
idea
and
now
what
news
your
mother
and
sisters
are
quite
well
i
hope
and
were
you
supposed
to
get
married
at
plassans
about
six
months
ago
a
sudden
movement
made
by
vallagnosc
stopped
him
and
as
his
friend
had
glanced
into
the
larger
with
an
anxious
expression
he
also
turned
round
and
noticed
that
mademoiselle
de
boves
was
closely
watching
them
blanche
tall
and
sturdy
resembled
her
mother
but
her
face
was
already
puffed
out
and
her
features
seemed
large
swollen
as
it
were
by
unhealthy
fat
then
in
reply
to
a
discreet
question
paul
intimated
that
nothing
was
yet
settled
perhaps
nothing
would
be
settled
he
had
made
the
young
person
acquaintance
at
madame
desforges
where
he
had
visited
a
good
deal
the
previous
winter
but
whither
he
now
very
rarely
came
which
explained
why
he
had
not
met
octave
there
before
in
their
turn
the
boves
invited
him
and
he
was
especially
fond
of
the
father
an
about
town
who
had
retired
into
an
official
position
on
the
other
hand
there
was
no
money
madame
de
boves
having
brought
her
husband
nothing
but
her
beauty
as
a
marriage
portion
so
the
family
were
living
poorly
on
their
last
mortgaged
farm
to
the
little
money
derived
from
which
were
fortunately
added
the
nine
thousand
francs
a
year
drawn
by
the
count
as
of
the
state
studs
certain
escapades
however
continued
to
empty
his
purse
and
the
ladies
mother
and
daughter
were
kept
very
short
of
money
being
at
times
reduced
to
turning
their
dresses
themselves
in
that
case
why
marry
was
mouret
simple
question
well
i
ca
go
on
like
this
for
ever
said
vallagnosc
with
a
weary
movement
of
the
eyelids
besides
there
are
certain
expectations
we
are
waiting
for
the
death
of
an
aunt
however
mouret
still
kept
his
eye
on
monsieur
de
boves
who
seated
next
to
madame
guibal
proved
most
attentive
to
her
laughing
softly
the
while
with
an
amorous
air
thereupon
octave
turned
to
his
friend
with
such
a
significant
twinkle
of
the
eye
that
the
latter
added
not
that
one
at
least
not
yet
the
misfortune
is
that
his
duties
call
him
to
the
four
corners
of
france
to
the
breeding
dépôts
so
that
he
has
frequent
pretexts
for
absenting
himself
last
month
whilst
his
wife
supposed
him
to
be
at
perpignan
he
was
simply
carrying
on
in
paris
in
an
neighbourhood
there
ensued
a
pause
then
the
young
man
who
was
also
watching
the
count
gallantry
towards
madame
guibal
resumed
in
a
low
tone
really
i
think
you
are
right
the
more
so
as
the
dear
lady
is
not
exactly
a
saint
if
all
people
say
be
true
but
just
look
at
him
he
comical
trying
to
magnetize
her
with
his
eyes
the
gallantry
my
dear
fellow
i
adore
that
man
and
if
i
marry
his
daughter
he
may
safely
say
it
for
his
sake
mouret
laughed
greatly
amused
he
questioned
vallagnosc
again
and
when
he
found
that
the
first
idea
of
a
marriage
between
him
and
blanche
had
come
from
madame
desforges
he
thought
the
story
better
still
that
dear
henriette
took
a
widow
delight
in
marrying
people
so
much
so
that
when
she
had
provided
for
the
girls
she
sometimes
allowed
their
fathers
to
choose
friends
from
her
company
at
that
moment
she
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
little
followed
by
a
gentleman
apparently
about
sixty
years
old
whose
arrival
had
not
been
observed
by
the
two
friends
absorbed
as
they
were
in
the
conversation
they
were
carrying
on
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
ladies
voices
these
voices
at
times
rang
out
in
a
shriller
key
above
the
tinkling
of
the
small
spoons
in
the
china
cups
and
from
time
to
time
during
a
brief
silence
you
heard
a
saucer
being
harshly
laid
down
on
the
marble
table
a
sudden
gleam
of
the
setting
sun
which
had
just
emerged
from
behind
a
thick
cloud
gilded
the
crests
of
the
in
the
gardens
and
streamed
through
the
windows
in
a
red
golden
flame
whose
glow
lighted
up
the
brocatel
and
of
the
furniture
this
way
my
dear
baron
said
madame
desforges
allow
me
to
introduce
to
you
monsieur
octave
mouret
who
is
longing
to
express
the
admiration
he
feels
for
you
and
turning
round
towards
octave
she
added
baron
hartmann
a
smile
played
on
the
old
man
lips
he
was
short
and
vigorous
with
a
large
alsatian
head
and
a
heavy
face
which
lighted
up
with
a
gleam
of
intelligence
at
the
slightest
curl
of
his
mouth
the
slightest
movement
of
his
eyelids
for
the
last
fortnight
he
had
resisted
henriette
wish
that
he
should
consent
to
this
interview
not
that
he
felt
any
immoderate
jealousy
of
mouret
but
because
this
was
the
third
friend
henriette
had
introduced
to
him
and
he
was
afraid
of
becoming
ridiculous
at
last
and
so
on
approaching
octave
he
put
on
the
discreet
smile
of
one
who
albeit
willing
to
behave
amiably
is
not
disposed
to
be
a
dupe
oh
sir
said
mouret
with
his
provençal
enthusiasm
the
crédit
immobilier
last
operation
was
really
astonishing
you
can
not
think
how
happy
and
proud
i
am
to
know
you
too
kind
sir
too
kind
repeated
the
baron
still
smiling
henriette
robed
in
a
lace
dress
which
revealed
her
delicate
neck
and
wrists
looked
at
them
with
her
clear
eyes
without
any
sign
of
embarrassment
standing
between
the
two
raising
her
head
and
going
from
one
to
the
other
she
indeed
appeared
delighted
to
see
them
so
friendly
together
gentlemen
said
she
at
last
i
leave
you
to
your
conversation
and
turning
towards
paul
who
had
risen
from
the
sofa
she
resumed
will
you
accept
a
cup
of
tea
monsieur
de
vallagnosc
with
pleasure
madame
he
replied
and
they
both
returned
to
the
larger
mouret
resumed
his
seat
on
the
sofa
when
baron
hartmann
likewise
had
sat
down
on
it
and
forthwith
the
young
man
broke
into
renewed
praise
of
the
crédit
immobilier
operations
from
that
he
went
on
to
the
subject
so
near
his
heart
speaking
of
the
new
thoroughfare
a
lengthening
of
the
rue
réaumur
a
section
of
which
running
from
the
place
de
la
bourse
to
the
place
de
was
about
to
be
opened
under
the
name
of
the
rue
du
it
had
been
declared
a
work
of
public
utility
eighteen
months
previously
the
expropriation
jury
had
just
been
appointed
and
the
whole
neighbourhood
was
excited
about
this
new
street
anxiously
awaiting
the
commencement
of
the
works
and
taking
a
keen
interest
in
the
houses
condemned
to
disappear
for
three
years
mouret
had
been
waiting
for
this
work
first
in
the
expectation
of
an
increase
of
his
own
business
secondly
for
the
furtherance
of
certain
schemes
of
enlargement
which
he
dared
not
openly
avow
so
extensive
were
his
ideas
as
the
rue
du
was
to
cut
through
the
rue
de
choiseul
and
the
rue
de
la
michodière
he
pictured
the
ladies
paradise
occupying
the
whole
block
of
building
which
these
streets
and
the
rue
surrounded
and
he
already
imagined
it
with
a
princely
frontage
in
the
new
thoroughfare
dominating
everything
around
like
some
lord
and
master
of
the
conquered
city
hence
his
strong
desire
to
make
baron
hartmann
acquaintance
as
soon
as
he
had
learnt
that
the
crédit
immobilier
had
contracted
with
the
authorities
to
open
and
build
this
rue
du
on
condition
that
it
should
receive
the
frontage
ground
on
each
side
of
the
street
really
he
repeated
trying
to
assume
a
naive
look
you
hand
over
the
street
ready
made
with
sewers
pavements
and
gas
lamps
and
the
frontage
ground
will
suffice
to
compensate
you
oh
it
curious
very
curious
at
last
he
came
to
the
delicate
point
he
was
aware
that
the
crédit
immobilier
was
secretly
buying
up
the
houses
forming
part
of
the
same
block
as
the
ladies
paradise
not
only
those
which
were
to
fall
under
the
demolishers
pickaxes
but
the
others
as
well
those
which
were
to
remain
standing
and
he
suspected
the
existence
of
a
project
for
founding
some
great
establishment
which
made
him
anxious
about
those
enlargements
of
his
own
premises
of
which
he
was
ever
dreaming
seized
with
fear
at
the
idea
that
he
might
one
day
come
into
collision
with
a
powerful
company
owning
property
which
they
certainly
would
not
sell
it
was
precisely
this
fear
which
had
prompted
him
to
seek
an
alliance
between
himself
and
the
baron
under
henriette
auspices
no
doubt
he
could
have
seen
the
financier
at
his
office
and
have
there
talked
the
affair
over
at
his
ease
but
he
felt
that
he
would
be
stronger
in
henriette
house
to
be
near
her
within
the
beloved
perfume
of
her
presence
to
have
her
ready
to
convince
them
both
with
a
smile
seemed
to
him
a
certain
guarantee
of
success
have
you
bought
the
former
hôtel
duvillard
that
old
building
next
to
my
place
he
suddenly
inquired
the
baron
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
then
denied
it
but
mouret
looked
him
straight
in
the
face
and
smiled
from
that
moment
beginning
to
play
the
part
of
an
young
man
who
was
always
straightforward
in
business
look
here
monsieur
le
baron
said
he
as
i
have
the
unexpected
honour
of
meeting
you
i
must
make
a
confession
oh
i
do
ask
you
for
any
of
your
secrets
but
i
am
going
to
entrust
you
with
mine
for
i
certain
that
i
could
place
them
in
better
hands
besides
i
want
your
advice
i
have
long
wished
to
call
and
see
you
but
dared
not
do
so
he
did
make
his
confession
and
related
his
debut
in
life
not
even
concealing
the
financial
crisis
through
which
he
was
passing
in
the
midst
of
his
triumph
everything
was
brought
up
the
successive
enlargements
of
his
premises
the
continual
reinvestments
of
all
profits
in
the
business
the
sums
contributed
by
his
employees
the
existence
of
the
establishment
risked
at
every
fresh
sale
in
which
the
entire
capital
was
staked
as
it
were
on
a
single
throw
of
the
dice
however
it
was
not
money
he
wanted
for
he
had
a
fanatic
faith
in
his
customers
his
ambition
ran
higher
and
he
proposed
to
the
baron
a
partnership
in
which
the
crédit
immobilier
should
contribute
the
colossal
palace
which
he
pictured
in
his
dreams
whilst
for
his
part
he
would
give
his
genius
and
the
business
he
had
already
created
everything
would
be
properly
valued
nothing
appeared
to
him
easier
to
realise
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
your
land
and
buildings
he
asked
persistently
you
have
a
plan
no
doubt
but
i
quite
certain
that
your
idea
is
not
so
good
as
mine
think
of
it
we
build
fresh
galleries
on
the
vacant
ground
we
pull
the
houses
down
or
them
and
open
the
most
extensive
establishment
in
paris
a
bazaar
which
will
bring
in
millions
and
then
he
let
this
fervent
heartfelt
exclamation
escape
him
ah
if
i
could
only
do
without
you
but
you
hold
everything
now
besides
i
shall
never
have
the
necessary
capital
come
we
must
come
to
an
understanding
it
would
be
a
crime
not
to
do
so
how
you
go
ahead
my
dear
sir
baron
hartmann
contented
himself
with
replying
what
an
imagination
you
have
he
shook
his
head
and
continued
to
smile
resolved
not
to
return
confidence
for
confidence
in
point
of
fact
the
idea
of
the
crédit
immobilier
was
to
found
in
the
rue
du
a
huge
rival
to
the
grand
hôtel
a
luxurious
hostelry
whose
central
position
would
attract
foreigners
at
the
same
time
however
as
the
hotel
was
only
to
occupy
a
certain
frontage
the
baron
might
also
have
entertained
idea
and
have
treated
for
the
rest
of
the
block
of
houses
which
still
represented
a
vast
surface
however
he
had
already
advanced
funds
to
two
of
henriette
friends
and
he
was
getting
tired
of
his
lavishness
besides
despite
his
passion
for
activity
which
prompted
him
to
open
his
purse
to
every
fellow
of
intelligence
and
courage
commercial
genius
astonished
rather
than
captivated
him
was
not
the
founding
of
such
a
gigantic
shop
a
fanciful
imprudent
scheme
would
he
not
court
certain
failure
by
thus
enlarging
the
drapery
trade
beyond
all
reasonable
bounds
in
short
he
did
believe
in
the
idea
and
refused
his
support
no
doubt
the
idea
is
attractive
said
he
but
it
a
poet
idea
where
would
you
find
the
customers
to
fill
such
a
cathedral
mouret
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
in
silence
as
if
stupefied
by
the
refusal
which
these
words
implied
was
it
possible
a
man
of
such
foresight
who
divined
the
presence
of
money
at
no
matter
what
depth
and
suddenly
with
an
extremely
eloquent
gesture
he
pointed
to
the
ladies
in
the
and
exclaimed
customers
why
look
there
the
sun
was
paling
and
the
flame
was
now
but
a
yellowish
gleam
dying
away
on
the
silk
of
the
hangings
and
the
panels
of
the
furniture
at
this
approach
of
twilight
the
large
room
was
steeped
in
warm
cosy
pleasantness
while
monsieur
de
boves
and
paul
de
vallagnosc
stood
chatting
near
one
of
the
windows
their
eyes
wandering
far
away
into
the
gardens
the
ladies
had
closed
up
forming
in
the
middle
of
the
room
a
small
circle
of
skirts
whence
arose
bursts
of
laughter
whispered
words
ardent
questions
and
replies
all
woman
passion
for
expenditure
and
finery
they
were
talking
about
dress
and
madame
de
boves
was
describing
a
gown
she
had
seen
at
a
ball
first
of
all
a
mauve
silk
skirt
covered
with
flounces
of
old
alençon
lace
twelve
inches
deep
oh
is
it
possible
exclaimed
madame
marty
some
women
are
very
fortunate
baron
hartmann
who
had
followed
mouret
gesture
was
looking
at
the
ladies
through
the
doorway
which
was
wide
open
and
he
continued
listening
to
them
with
one
ear
whilst
the
young
man
inflamed
by
his
desire
to
convince
him
went
yet
deeper
into
the
question
explaining
the
mechanism
of
the
new
style
of
drapery
business
this
branch
of
commerce
was
now
based
on
a
rapid
and
continual
turning
over
of
capital
which
it
was
necessary
to
convert
into
goods
as
often
as
possible
in
the
same
year
for
instance
that
year
his
capital
which
only
amounted
to
five
hundred
thousand
francs
had
been
turned
over
four
times
and
had
thus
produced
business
to
the
amount
of
two
millions
but
this
was
a
mere
trifle
which
could
be
increased
tenfold
for
later
on
in
certain
departments
he
certainly
hoped
to
turn
the
capital
over
fifteen
or
twenty
times
in
the
course
of
the
twelvemonth
you
understand
baron
the
whole
system
lies
in
that
it
is
very
simple
but
it
had
to
be
found
out
we
do
need
an
enormous
working
capital
the
sole
effort
we
have
to
make
is
to
get
rid
of
the
stock
we
buy
as
quickly
as
possible
so
as
to
replace
it
by
other
stock
which
each
time
will
make
our
capital
return
interest
in
this
way
we
can
content
ourselves
with
a
very
small
profit
as
our
general
expenses
amount
to
as
much
as
sixteen
per
and
as
we
seldom
make
more
than
twenty
per
cent
on
our
goods
there
is
only
a
net
profit
of
four
per
cent
at
the
utmost
only
this
will
finish
by
representing
millions
when
we
can
operate
on
large
quantities
of
goods
incessantly
renewed
you
follow
me
do
you
nothing
can
be
clearer
the
baron
again
shook
his
head
doubtfully
he
who
had
entertained
the
boldest
schemes
and
whose
daring
at
the
time
of
the
introduction
of
was
still
spoken
of
remained
in
the
present
instance
uneasy
and
obstinate
i
quite
understand
said
he
you
sell
cheap
in
order
to
sell
a
quantity
and
you
sell
a
quantity
in
order
to
sell
cheap
but
you
must
sell
and
i
repeat
my
former
question
whom
will
you
sell
to
how
do
you
hope
to
keep
up
such
a
colossal
sale
a
loud
exclamation
coming
from
the
interrupted
mouret
just
as
he
began
to
reply
it
was
madame
guibal
declaring
that
she
would
have
preferred
the
flounces
of
old
alençon
simply
round
the
upper
skirt
of
the
dress
but
my
dear
said
madame
de
boves
the
upper
skirt
was
covered
with
it
as
well
i
never
saw
anything
richer
ah
that
a
good
idea
resumed
madame
desforges
i
got
several
yards
of
alençon
somewhere
i
must
look
them
up
for
a
trimming
then
the
voices
fell
again
sinking
into
a
murmur
prices
were
quoted
a
feverish
desire
to
buy
and
bargain
stirred
all
the
ladies
they
were
purchasing
lace
by
the
mile
why
declared
mouret
when
he
could
at
last
speak
one
can
sell
what
one
likes
when
one
knows
how
to
sell
therein
lies
our
triumph
and
then
with
his
southern
enthusiasm
he
pictured
the
new
business
at
work
in
warm
glowing
phrases
which
brought
everything
vividly
before
the
eyes
first
came
the
wonderful
power
resulting
from
the
assemblage
of
goods
all
accumulated
on
one
point
and
sustaining
and
facilitating
the
sale
of
one
another
there
was
never
any
the
article
of
the
season
was
always
on
hand
and
from
counter
to
counter
the
customer
found
herself
caught
and
subjugated
at
one
buying
the
material
for
a
gown
at
another
cotton
and
trimming
elsewhere
a
mantle
in
fact
everything
necessary
to
complete
her
costume
while
in
addition
there
were
all
the
unforeseen
purchases
chases
a
surrender
to
a
longing
for
the
useless
and
the
pretty
next
he
began
to
sing
the
praises
of
the
plain
figure
system
the
great
revolution
in
the
business
sprang
from
this
fortunate
inspiration
if
the
small
shops
were
dying
out
it
was
because
they
could
not
struggle
against
the
low
prices
which
the
tickets
guaranteed
competition
now
went
on
under
the
very
eyes
of
the
public
a
look
in
the
windows
enabled
people
to
contrast
the
prices
of
different
establishments
and
each
shop
in
turn
was
lowering
its
rates
contenting
itself
with
the
smallest
possible
profit
there
could
be
no
deceit
no
long
prepared
stroke
of
fortune
by
selling
an
article
at
double
its
value
there
were
simply
current
operations
a
regular
percentage
levied
on
all
goods
and
success
depended
solely
on
the
skilful
working
of
the
sales
which
became
the
larger
from
the
very
circumstance
that
they
were
carried
on
openly
and
honestly
was
it
not
altogether
an
astonishing
development
and
it
was
already
revolutionizing
the
markets
and
transforming
paris
for
it
was
made
of
woman
flesh
and
blood
i
have
the
women
i
do
care
a
hang
for
the
rest
exclaimed
mouret
with
a
brutal
frankness
born
of
his
passion
at
this
cry
baron
hartmann
appeared
somewhat
moved
his
smile
lost
its
touch
of
irony
and
he
glanced
at
the
young
man
gradually
won
over
by
the
confidence
he
displayed
and
feeling
a
growing
friendship
for
him
hush
he
murmured
paternally
they
will
hear
you
but
the
ladies
were
now
all
speaking
at
once
so
excited
that
they
did
not
even
listen
to
each
other
madame
de
boves
was
finishing
the
description
of
an
a
mauve
silk
tunic
draped
and
caught
up
by
bows
of
lace
the
bodice
cut
very
low
with
similar
bows
of
lace
on
the
shoulders
you
see
said
she
i
am
having
a
bodice
made
like
it
with
some
satin
for
my
part
interrupted
madame
bourdelais
i
was
bent
on
buying
some
velvet
oh
such
a
bargain
then
suddenly
madame
marty
asked
how
much
did
the
silk
cost
and
off
they
started
again
all
together
madame
guibal
henriette
and
blanche
were
measuring
cutting
out
and
making
up
it
was
a
pillage
of
material
a
ransacking
of
all
the
shops
an
appetite
for
luxury
seeking
satisfaction
in
toilettes
envied
and
dreamed
of
with
such
happiness
at
finding
themselves
in
an
atmosphere
of
finery
that
they
buried
themselves
in
it
as
in
warm
air
necessary
to
their
existence
mouret
had
glanced
towards
the
larger
and
in
a
few
phrases
whispered
in
the
baron
ear
as
if
he
were
confiding
to
him
one
of
those
amorous
secrets
which
men
sometimes
venture
to
reveal
among
themselves
he
finished
explaining
the
mechanism
of
modern
commerce
and
above
all
that
he
had
already
spoken
of
dominating
everything
else
appeared
the
exploitation
of
woman
to
which
everything
conduced
the
capital
incessantly
renewed
the
system
of
assembling
goods
together
the
attraction
of
cheapness
and
the
tranquillizing
effect
of
the
marking
in
plain
figures
it
was
for
woman
that
all
the
establishments
were
struggling
in
wild
competition
it
was
woman
whom
they
were
continually
catching
in
the
snares
of
their
bargains
after
bewildering
her
with
their
displays
they
had
awakened
new
desires
in
her
flesh
they
constituted
an
immense
temptation
before
which
she
fatally
succumbed
yielding
at
first
to
reasonable
purchases
of
articles
needed
in
the
household
then
tempted
by
her
coquetry
and
finally
subjugated
and
devoured
by
increasing
their
business
tenfold
and
popularizing
luxury
they
the
drapers
became
a
terrible
instrument
of
prodigality
ravaging
households
and
preparing
mad
freaks
of
fashion
which
proved
ever
more
and
more
costly
and
if
woman
reigned
in
their
shops
like
a
queen
cajoled
flattered
and
overwhelmed
with
attentions
she
was
one
on
whom
her
subjects
traffic
and
who
pays
for
each
fresh
caprice
with
a
drop
of
her
blood
from
beneath
the
very
gracefulness
of
his
gallantry
mouret
thus
allowed
the
baron
to
divine
the
brutality
of
a
jew
who
sells
woman
by
the
pound
weight
he
raised
a
temple
to
her
caused
her
to
be
steeped
in
incense
by
a
legion
of
shopmen
prepared
the
ritual
of
a
new
cultus
thinking
of
nothing
but
woman
and
ever
seeking
to
imagine
more
powerful
fascinations
but
behind
her
back
when
he
had
emptied
her
purse
and
shattered
her
nerves
he
remained
full
of
the
secret
scorn
of
a
man
to
whom
a
woman
has
been
foolish
enough
to
yield
once
have
the
women
on
your
side
he
whispered
to
the
baron
laughing
boldly
and
you
could
sell
the
very
world
now
the
baron
understood
a
few
sentences
had
sufficed
he
guessed
the
rest
and
such
a
gallant
exploitation
inflamed
him
stirring
up
the
memories
of
his
past
life
of
pleasure
his
eyes
twinkled
in
a
knowing
way
and
he
ended
by
looking
with
an
air
of
admiration
at
the
inventor
of
this
machine
for
devouring
the
female
sex
it
was
really
clever
and
then
he
made
precisely
the
same
remark
as
bourdoncle
a
remark
suggested
to
him
by
his
long
experience
they
make
you
suffer
for
it
by
and
by
you
know
said
he
but
mouret
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
an
air
of
overwhelming
disdain
they
all
belonged
to
him
they
were
his
property
and
he
belonged
to
none
of
them
after
deriving
his
fortune
and
his
pleasures
from
them
he
intended
to
throw
them
all
over
for
those
who
might
still
find
their
account
in
them
it
was
the
rational
cold
disdain
of
a
southerner
and
a
speculator
well
my
dear
baron
he
asked
in
conclusion
will
you
join
me
does
this
affair
appear
possible
to
you
albeit
half
conquered
the
baron
did
not
wish
to
enter
into
any
engagement
yet
a
doubt
remained
beneath
the
charm
which
was
gradually
operating
on
him
and
he
was
going
to
reply
in
an
evasive
manner
when
a
pressing
call
from
the
ladies
spared
him
the
trouble
amidst
light
bursts
of
laughter
voices
were
repeating
monsieur
mouret
monsieur
mouret
and
as
the
latter
annoyed
at
being
interrupted
pretended
not
to
hear
madame
de
boves
who
had
risen
a
moment
previously
came
as
far
as
the
door
of
the
little
you
are
wanted
monsieur
mouret
it
is
very
gallant
of
you
to
bury
yourself
in
a
corner
to
talk
over
business
thereupon
he
decided
to
join
the
ladies
with
an
apparent
good
grace
a
air
of
rapture
which
quite
astonished
the
baron
both
of
them
rose
and
passed
into
the
other
room
but
i
am
quite
at
your
service
ladies
said
mouret
on
entering
a
smile
on
his
lips
he
was
greeted
with
an
acclamation
of
triumph
and
was
obliged
to
step
forward
the
ladies
making
room
for
him
in
their
midst
the
sun
had
just
set
behind
the
trees
in
the
gardens
the
daylight
was
departing
delicate
shadows
were
gradually
invading
the
spacious
apartment
it
was
the
emotional
hour
of
twilight
that
quiet
voluptuous
moment
which
reigns
in
parisian
flats
between
the
dying
brightness
of
the
street
and
the
lighting
of
the
lamps
in
the
kitchen
monsieur
de
boves
and
vallagnosc
still
standing
before
a
window
cast
shadows
upon
the
carpet
whilst
motionless
in
the
last
gleam
of
light
which
came
in
by
the
other
window
monsieur
marty
who
had
quietly
entered
shewed
his
silhouette
his
frock
coat
and
his
pale
face
wan
from
constant
teaching
and
the
more
haggard
as
what
he
had
heard
of
the
ladies
conversation
had
quite
upset
him
is
your
sale
still
fixed
for
next
monday
madame
marty
was
just
asking
certainly
madame
replied
mouret
in
a
voice
an
voice
which
he
assumed
when
speaking
to
women
henriette
thereupon
intervened
we
are
all
going
you
know
they
say
you
are
preparing
wonders
oh
wonders
he
murmured
with
an
air
of
modest
fatuity
i
simply
try
to
deserve
your
patronage
but
they
pressed
him
with
questions
madame
bourdelais
madame
guibal
even
blanche
wanted
to
know
something
come
give
us
some
particulars
repeated
madame
de
boves
persistently
you
are
making
us
die
of
curiosity
and
they
were
surrounding
him
when
henriette
observed
that
he
had
not
even
taken
a
cup
of
tea
at
this
they
were
plunged
into
desolation
and
four
of
them
set
about
serving
him
stipulating
however
that
he
must
answer
them
afterwards
henriette
poured
the
tea
out
madame
marty
held
the
cup
whilst
madame
de
boves
and
madame
bourdelais
contended
for
the
honour
of
sweetening
it
then
when
he
had
declined
to
sit
down
and
began
to
drink
his
tea
slowly
standing
up
in
the
midst
of
them
they
all
drew
nearer
imprisoning
him
in
the
circle
of
their
skirts
and
with
their
heads
raised
and
their
eyes
sparkling
they
smiled
upon
him
and
what
about
silk
your
paris
delight
which
all
the
papers
are
talking
of
resumed
madame
marty
impatiently
oh
he
replied
it
an
extraordinary
article
faille
supple
and
strong
you
see
it
ladies
and
you
see
it
nowhere
else
for
we
have
bought
the
exclusive
right
to
it
really
a
fine
silk
at
five
francs
sixty
centimes
said
madame
bourdelais
enthusiastic
one
can
hardly
believe
it
ever
since
the
advertisements
and
puffs
had
appeared
this
silk
had
occupied
a
considerable
place
in
their
daily
life
they
talked
of
it
promising
themselves
some
of
it
all
agog
with
desire
and
doubt
and
beneath
the
inquisitive
chatter
with
which
they
overwhelmed
the
young
man
one
could
divine
their
different
temperaments
as
purchasers
madame
marty
carried
away
by
her
rage
for
spending
money
bought
everything
at
the
ladies
paradise
without
selecting
just
as
things
chanced
to
be
placed
in
the
windows
or
on
the
counters
madame
guibal
on
the
other
hand
walked
about
the
shop
for
hours
without
ever
buying
anything
happy
and
satisfied
in
simply
feasting
her
eyes
madame
de
boves
short
of
money
and
always
tortured
by
some
immoderate
desire
nourished
a
feeling
of
rancour
against
the
goods
she
could
not
carry
away
with
her
madame
bourdelais
with
the
sharp
eyes
of
a
careful
and
practical
housewife
made
straight
for
the
bargains
availing
herself
of
the
big
establishments
with
such
skill
that
she
saved
a
lot
of
money
and
lastly
henriette
having
very
elegant
tastes
only
purchased
certain
articles
there
such
as
gloves
hosiery
and
her
coarser
linen
we
have
other
stuffs
of
astonishing
cheapness
and
richness
continued
mouret
in
his
musical
voice
for
instance
i
recommend
you
our
golden
grain
a
taffeta
of
incomparable
brilliancy
in
the
fancy
silks
there
are
some
charming
lines
designs
specially
chosen
from
among
thousands
by
our
buyer
and
in
velvets
you
will
find
an
exceedingly
rich
collection
of
shades
i
warn
you
however
that
cloth
will
be
greatly
worn
this
year
you
see
our
and
our
cheviots
they
had
ceased
to
interrupt
him
and
drew
yet
closer
their
lips
parted
by
vague
smiles
their
faces
eagerly
as
if
their
whole
beings
were
springing
towards
the
tempter
their
eyes
grew
dim
and
slight
quivers
ran
through
them
but
he
meantime
retained
his
calm
conquering
air
amidst
the
intoxicating
perfumes
which
their
hair
exhaled
and
between
each
sentence
he
continued
to
sip
a
little
of
his
tea
the
aroma
of
which
softened
those
sharper
odours
at
sight
of
such
a
power
of
fascination
so
well
controlled
strong
enough
to
play
with
woman
without
being
overcome
by
the
intoxication
which
she
diffuses
baron
hartmann
who
had
not
ceased
to
look
at
mouret
felt
his
admiration
increasing
so
cloth
will
be
worn
resumed
madame
marty
whose
rugged
face
sparkled
with
coquettish
passion
i
must
have
a
look
at
it
madame
bourdelais
who
kept
a
cool
in
her
turn
remarked
your
remnant
sales
take
place
on
thursdays
do
they
i
shall
wait
i
have
all
my
little
ones
to
clothe
and
turning
her
delicate
blonde
head
towards
the
mistress
of
the
house
she
asked
sauveur
is
still
your
dressmaker
i
suppose
yes
replied
henriette
sauveur
is
very
dear
but
she
is
the
only
person
in
paris
who
knows
how
to
make
a
besides
monsieur
mouret
may
say
what
he
likes
but
she
has
the
prettiest
designs
designs
that
are
not
seen
anywhere
else
i
ca
bear
to
see
the
same
dresses
as
mine
on
every
woman
back
at
first
mouret
slightly
smiled
then
he
intimated
that
madame
sauveur
bought
her
material
at
his
shop
no
doubt
she
went
to
the
manufacturers
direct
for
certain
designs
of
which
she
acquired
the
sole
right
of
sale
but
for
black
silks
for
instance
she
watched
for
the
paradise
bargains
laying
in
a
considerable
stock
which
she
disposed
of
at
double
and
treble
the
price
she
gave
thus
i
am
quite
sure
that
her
buyers
will
snap
up
our
paris
delight
why
should
she
go
to
the
manufacturers
and
pay
dearer
for
this
silk
than
she
would
at
my
place
on
my
word
of
honour
we
shall
sell
it
at
a
loss
this
was
a
decisive
blow
for
the
ladies
the
idea
of
getting
goods
below
cost
price
awoke
in
them
all
the
natural
greed
of
woman
whose
enjoyment
in
purchasing
is
doubled
when
she
thinks
that
she
is
robbing
the
tradesman
he
knew
the
sex
to
be
incapable
of
resisting
anything
cheap
but
we
sell
everything
for
nothing
he
exclaimed
gaily
taking
up
madame
desforges
fan
which
lay
behind
him
on
the
table
for
instance
here
this
fan
how
much
do
you
say
it
cost
the
chantilly
cost
francs
and
the
mounting
two
hundred
said
henriette
well
the
chantilly
is
dear
however
we
have
the
same
at
eighteen
francs
as
for
the
mount
my
dear
madame
it
a
shameful
robbery
i
should
not
dare
to
sell
one
like
it
for
more
than
ninety
francs
just
what
i
said
exclaimed
madame
bourdelais
ninety
francs
murmured
madame
de
boves
one
must
be
very
poor
indeed
to
go
without
one
at
that
price
she
had
taken
up
the
fan
and
was
again
examining
it
with
her
daughter
blanche
and
over
her
large
regular
face
and
in
her
big
sleepy
eyes
spread
an
expression
of
suppressed
and
despairing
longing
which
she
could
not
satisfy
the
fan
once
more
went
the
round
of
the
ladies
amidst
various
remarks
and
exclamations
monsieur
de
boves
and
vallagnosc
meantime
had
left
the
window
and
whilst
the
former
returned
to
his
place
behind
madame
guibal
whose
charms
he
again
began
to
admire
with
his
correct
and
superior
air
the
young
man
leant
over
blanche
endeavouring
to
think
of
some
agreeable
remark
do
you
think
it
rather
gloomy
mademoiselle
that
white
mount
and
the
black
lace
oh
she
replied
gravely
not
a
blush
colouring
her
inflated
cheeks
i
saw
one
made
of
and
white
feathers
something
truly
virginal
then
monsieur
de
boves
who
had
doubtless
observed
the
distressful
glances
with
which
his
wife
was
following
the
fan
at
last
added
his
word
to
the
conversation
those
flimsy
things
soon
break
said
he
of
course
they
do
declared
madame
guibal
with
a
pout
affecting
an
air
of
indifference
i
tired
of
having
mine
mended
for
several
minutes
madame
marty
very
much
excited
by
the
conversation
had
been
feverishly
turning
her
red
leather
bag
about
on
her
lap
for
she
had
not
yet
been
able
to
show
her
purchases
she
was
burning
with
a
sort
of
sensual
desire
to
display
them
and
suddenly
forgetting
her
husband
presence
she
opened
the
bag
and
took
out
of
it
a
few
yards
of
narrow
lace
wound
on
a
piece
of
cardboard
this
is
the
valenciennes
for
my
daughter
said
she
it
an
inch
and
a
half
wide
is
it
delicious
one
franc
ninety
centimes
the
metre
the
lace
passed
from
hand
to
hand
the
ladies
were
astonished
mouret
assured
them
that
he
sold
these
little
trimmings
at
cost
price
however
madame
marty
had
closed
the
bag
as
if
to
conceal
certain
things
she
must
not
show
but
after
the
success
obtained
by
the
valenciennes
she
was
unable
to
resist
the
temptation
of
taking
out
a
handkerchief
there
was
this
handkerchief
as
well
real
brussels
my
dear
oh
a
bargain
twenty
francs
and
after
that
the
bag
became
inexhaustible
she
blushed
with
pleasure
at
each
fresh
article
she
took
out
there
was
a
spanish
cravat
thirty
francs
she
had
wanted
it
but
the
shopman
had
sworn
it
was
the
last
one
in
stock
and
that
in
future
the
price
would
be
raised
next
came
a
chantilly
veil
rather
dear
fifty
francs
if
she
did
wear
it
she
could
make
it
do
for
her
daughter
really
lace
is
so
pretty
she
repeated
with
her
nervous
laugh
once
i
inside
i
could
buy
everything
and
this
asked
madame
de
boves
taking
up
and
examining
some
guipure
that
replied
she
is
for
an
insertion
there
are
yards
a
franc
the
yard
just
fancy
but
asked
madame
bourdelais
in
surprise
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
it
i
sure
i
do
know
but
it
was
such
a
funny
pattern
at
that
moment
however
she
chanced
to
raise
her
eyes
and
perceived
her
terrified
husband
in
front
of
her
he
had
turned
paler
than
ever
his
whole
person
expressive
of
the
patient
resigned
anguish
of
a
powerless
man
witnessing
the
reckless
expenditure
of
his
dearly
earned
salary
every
fresh
bit
of
lace
to
him
meant
disaster
bitter
days
of
teaching
long
journeys
to
pupils
through
the
mud
the
whole
constant
effort
of
his
life
resulting
in
secret
misery
the
hell
of
a
necessitous
household
and
she
perceiving
the
increasing
wildness
of
his
look
wanted
to
catch
up
the
veil
cravat
and
handkerchief
and
put
them
out
of
sight
moving
her
feverish
hands
about
and
repeating
with
forced
laughter
you
get
me
a
scolding
from
my
husband
i
assure
you
my
dear
i
been
very
reasonable
for
there
was
a
large
lace
flounce
at
five
hundred
francs
oh
a
marvel
why
did
you
buy
it
asked
madame
guibal
calmly
monsieur
marty
is
the
most
gallant
of
men
the
poor
professor
was
obliged
to
bow
and
say
that
his
wife
was
quite
free
to
buy
what
she
liked
but
at
thought
of
the
danger
to
which
that
large
flounce
had
exposed
him
an
icy
shiver
sped
down
his
back
and
as
mouret
was
just
at
that
moment
affirming
that
the
new
shops
increased
the
comfort
of
households
he
glared
at
him
with
a
terrible
expression
the
flash
of
hatred
of
a
timid
man
who
would
like
to
throttle
the
destroyer
but
dares
not
but
the
ladies
had
still
retained
possession
of
the
lace
they
were
intoxicating
themselves
with
their
prolonged
contemplation
of
it
the
several
pieces
were
unrolled
and
then
passed
from
one
to
the
other
drawing
them
all
still
closer
together
linking
them
as
it
were
with
delicate
meshes
on
their
laps
there
was
a
continual
caress
of
this
wondrously
delicate
tissue
amidst
which
their
guilty
fingers
fondly
lingered
they
still
kept
mouret
a
close
prisoner
and
overwhelmed
him
with
fresh
questions
as
the
daylight
continued
to
decline
he
was
now
and
again
obliged
to
bend
his
head
grazing
their
hair
with
his
beard
as
he
examined
a
mesh
or
indicated
a
design
nevertheless
in
this
soft
voluptuousness
of
twilight
in
this
warm
feminine
atmosphere
mouret
still
remained
the
master
whatever
the
rapture
he
affected
he
seemed
to
be
a
woman
himself
they
felt
penetrated
overcome
by
the
delicate
sense
of
their
secret
passions
which
he
possessed
and
surrendered
themselves
to
him
quite
captivated
whilst
he
certain
that
he
had
them
at
his
mercy
appeared
like
the
despotic
monarch
of
finery
enthroned
above
them
all
oh
monsieur
mouret
monsieur
mouret
they
stammered
in
low
rapturous
voices
amidst
the
increasing
gloom
of
the
the
last
pale
gleams
of
the
heavens
were
dying
away
on
the
of
the
furniture
the
laces
alone
retained
a
snowy
reflection
against
the
dark
dresses
of
the
ladies
who
in
a
confused
group
around
the
young
man
had
a
vague
appearance
of
kneeling
worshipping
women
a
final
glow
still
shone
on
one
side
of
the
silver
teapot
a
gleam
like
that
of
a
burning
in
an
alcove
balmy
with
the
perfume
of
tea
but
suddenly
the
servant
entered
with
two
lamps
and
the
charm
was
destroyed
the
awoke
light
and
cheerful
once
more
madame
marty
replaced
her
lace
in
her
little
bag
and
madame
de
boves
ate
another
sponge
cake
whilst
henriette
who
had
risen
began
talking
in
a
low
tone
to
the
baron
near
one
of
the
windows
he
a
charming
fellow
said
the
baron
is
he
she
exclaimed
with
the
involuntary
impulse
of
a
woman
in
love
he
smiled
and
looked
at
her
with
paternal
indulgence
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
seen
her
so
completely
conquered
and
too
to
suffer
from
it
he
experienced
nothing
but
compassion
at
seeing
her
in
the
hands
of
this
handsome
fellow
seemingly
so
tender
and
yet
so
he
thought
he
ought
to
warn
her
and
so
in
a
joking
way
he
muttered
take
care
my
dear
or
he
eat
you
all
up
a
flash
of
jealousy
darted
from
henriette
fine
eyes
doubtless
she
understood
that
mouret
had
simply
made
use
of
her
to
get
at
the
baron
but
she
vowed
that
she
would
render
him
mad
with
passion
he
whose
hurried
style
of
was
instinct
with
the
facile
charm
of
a
song
thrown
to
the
four
winds
of
heaven
oh
said
she
affecting
to
joke
in
her
turn
the
lamb
always
finishes
by
eating
up
the
wolf
thereupon
the
baron
greatly
amused
encouraged
her
with
a
nod
could
she
be
the
woman
who
was
to
avenge
all
the
others
when
mouret
after
reminding
vallagnosc
that
he
wanted
to
show
him
his
machine
at
work
came
up
to
take
his
leave
the
baron
retained
him
near
the
window
opposite
the
gardens
now
steeped
in
darkness
he
was
at
last
yielding
to
the
young
man
power
of
fascination
confidence
had
come
to
him
on
seeing
him
amidst
those
ladies
both
conversed
for
a
moment
in
a
low
tone
and
then
the
banker
exclaimed
well
i
look
into
the
affair
it
settled
if
your
monday
sale
proves
as
important
as
you
expect
they
shook
hands
and
mouret
delighted
took
his
leave
for
he
never
enjoyed
his
dinner
unless
before
sitting
down
at
table
he
had
been
to
glance
at
the
day
receipts
at
the
ladies
paradise
chapter
iv
on
the
following
monday
the
of
october
a
bright
sun
of
victory
pierced
through
the
grey
clouds
which
had
darkened
paris
during
the
previous
week
there
had
even
been
a
drizzle
throughout
the
previous
night
a
sort
of
watery
mist
whose
moisture
had
dirtied
the
streets
but
in
the
early
morning
thanks
to
the
sharp
breezes
driving
the
clouds
away
the
pavement
had
become
drier
and
now
the
blue
sky
displayed
a
limpid
gaiety
thus
already
at
eight
the
ladies
paradise
blazed
forth
beneath
the
clear
in
all
the
glory
of
its
great
sale
of
winter
novelties
flags
were
flying
at
the
door
pieces
of
woollens
were
flapping
about
in
the
fresh
morning
air
animating
the
place
gaillon
with
the
bustle
of
a
country
fair
whilst
along
both
streets
the
windows
developed
symphonious
displays
whose
brilliant
tones
were
yet
heightened
by
the
clearness
of
the
glass
it
was
like
a
debauch
of
colour
a
street
pleasure
bursting
forth
a
wealth
of
purchasable
articles
publicly
displayed
on
which
everybody
could
feast
their
eyes
but
at
this
early
hour
very
few
people
entered
a
few
customers
pressed
for
time
housewives
of
the
neighbourhood
women
desirous
of
avoiding
the
afternoon
crush
behind
the
stuffs
which
decorated
the
shop
one
could
divine
that
it
was
empty
under
arms
and
waiting
for
customers
with
its
waxed
floors
and
its
counters
overflowing
with
goods
the
busy
morning
crowd
barely
glanced
at
the
windows
as
it
passed
without
slackening
its
steps
in
the
rue
and
on
the
place
gaillon
where
the
vehicles
were
to
take
their
stand
there
were
at
nine
only
two
cabs
the
inhabitants
of
the
district
and
especially
the
small
traders
stirred
up
by
such
a
show
of
streamers
and
decorations
alone
formed
little
groups
in
the
doorways
and
at
the
street
corners
gazing
at
the
paradise
and
venting
bitter
remarks
what
most
filled
them
with
indignation
was
the
sight
of
one
of
the
four
delivery
vans
just
introduced
by
mouret
which
was
standing
in
the
rue
de
la
michodière
in
front
of
the
delivery
office
these
vans
were
green
picked
out
with
yellow
and
red
their
brilliantly
varnished
panels
gleaming
with
gold
and
purple
in
the
sunlight
this
particular
one
with
its
medley
of
colours
and
the
name
of
the
establishment
painted
on
either
side
whilst
up
above
appeared
an
announcement
of
the
day
sale
finished
by
going
off
at
the
fast
trot
of
a
splendid
horse
after
being
filled
with
parcels
left
over
from
the
previous
night
and
baudu
who
was
standing
on
the
threshold
of
the
old
elbeuf
watched
it
rolling
off
towards
the
boulevard
where
it
disappeared
to
spread
amid
a
starry
radiance
the
hated
name
of
the
ladies
paradise
all
over
paris
meantime
a
few
cabs
were
arriving
and
forming
in
line
each
time
a
customer
entered
there
was
a
movement
amongst
the
shop
messengers
who
dressed
in
livery
consisting
of
a
light
green
coat
and
trousers
and
red
and
yellow
striped
waistcoat
were
drawn
up
under
the
lofty
doorway
jouve
the
inspector
and
retired
captain
was
also
there
in
a
and
white
tie
wearing
his
decoration
as
a
mark
of
respectability
and
probity
and
receiving
the
ladies
with
a
gravely
polite
air
he
bent
over
them
to
point
out
the
departments
and
then
they
vanished
into
the
vestibule
which
had
been
transformed
into
an
oriental
saloon
from
the
very
threshold
it
was
a
marvel
a
surprise
which
enchanted
all
of
them
it
was
to
mouret
that
this
idea
had
occurred
before
all
others
he
had
been
the
first
to
purchase
at
very
advantageous
rates
in
the
levant
a
collection
of
old
and
new
carpets
articles
then
but
seldom
seen
and
only
sold
at
curiosity
shops
at
high
prices
and
he
intended
to
flood
the
market
with
them
selling
them
at
but
little
more
than
cost
price
and
simply
utilizing
them
as
a
splendid
decoration
which
would
attract
the
best
class
of
art
customers
to
his
establishment
from
the
centre
of
the
place
gaillon
you
could
see
this
oriental
saloon
composed
solely
of
carpets
and
hung
up
under
his
direction
the
ceiling
was
covered
with
a
quantity
of
smyrna
carpets
whose
intricate
designs
stood
out
boldly
on
red
grounds
then
from
each
side
there
hung
syrian
and
karamanian
streaked
with
green
yellow
and
vermilion
diarbekir
hangings
of
a
commoner
type
rough
to
the
touch
like
shepherds
cloaks
and
carpets
which
could
also
be
used
as
long
ispahan
teheran
and
kermancha
rugs
broader
ones
from
schoumaka
and
madras
a
strange
florescence
of
peonies
and
palms
fantastic
blooms
in
a
garden
of
dreamland
on
the
floor
too
were
more
carpets
a
heap
of
greasy
fleeces
in
the
centre
was
an
agra
carpet
an
extraordinary
article
with
a
white
ground
and
a
broad
delicate
blue
border
through
which
ran
a
pattern
of
exquisite
design
and
then
here
there
and
everywhere
came
a
display
of
marvels
mecca
carpets
with
velvety
reflections
prayer
carpets
from
daghestan
with
the
symbolic
points
kurdistan
carpets
covered
with
blooming
flowers
and
finally
in
a
corner
a
pile
of
cheap
goods
gherdes
koula
and
kirchur
rugs
from
fifteen
francs
this
seeming
and
sumptuous
tent
fit
for
a
caliph
was
furnished
with
divans
and
made
of
camel
sacks
some
ornamented
with
variegated
lozenges
others
with
primitive
roses
turkey
arabia
persia
and
the
indies
were
all
there
they
had
emptied
the
palaces
looted
the
mosques
and
bazaars
a
tawny
gold
prevailed
in
the
weft
of
the
old
carpets
whose
faded
tints
retained
still
a
sombre
warmth
like
that
of
an
extinguished
furnace
a
beautiful
mellow
hue
suggestive
of
the
old
masters
visions
of
the
east
floated
before
you
at
sight
of
all
the
luxury
of
this
barbarous
art
amid
the
strong
odour
which
the
old
wool
retained
of
the
land
of
vermin
and
of
the
rising
sun
in
the
morning
at
eight
when
denise
who
was
to
enter
on
her
duties
that
very
monday
crossed
the
oriental
saloon
she
stopped
short
lost
in
astonishment
unable
to
recognise
the
shop
entrance
and
quite
overcome
by
this
decoration
planted
at
the
door
a
messenger
having
shown
her
to
the
top
of
the
house
and
handed
her
over
to
madame
cabin
who
cleaned
and
looked
after
the
rooms
this
person
installed
her
in
no
where
her
box
had
already
been
placed
it
was
a
narrow
cell
opening
on
the
roof
by
a
skylight
and
furnished
with
a
small
bed
a
wardrobe
a
and
two
chairs
twenty
similar
rooms
ran
along
the
corridor
and
of
the
young
ladies
in
the
house
the
twenty
who
had
no
relations
in
paris
slept
there
whilst
the
remaining
fifteen
lodged
outside
a
few
with
borrowed
aunts
and
cousins
denise
at
once
took
off
her
shabby
woollen
dress
worn
thin
by
brushing
and
mended
at
the
sleeves
the
only
gown
that
she
had
brought
from
valognes
and
then
donned
the
uniform
of
her
department
a
black
silk
dress
which
had
been
altered
for
her
and
which
she
found
ready
on
the
bed
this
dress
was
still
too
large
too
wide
across
the
shoulders
but
she
was
so
flurried
by
her
emotion
that
she
paid
no
heed
to
petty
questions
of
coquetry
she
had
never
worn
silk
before
and
when
rigged
out
in
this
unwonted
finery
she
went
downstairs
again
and
looked
at
her
shining
skirt
she
felt
quite
ashamed
of
the
noisy
rustling
of
the
silk
down
below
as
she
was
entering
her
department
a
quarrel
burst
out
and
she
heard
clara
exclaim
in
a
shrill
voice
madame
i
came
in
before
her
it
is
true
replied
marguerite
she
pushed
past
me
at
the
door
but
i
had
already
one
foot
in
the
room
the
matter
in
dispute
was
their
inscription
on
the
list
of
turns
which
regulated
the
sales
the
girls
wrote
their
names
on
a
slate
in
the
order
of
their
arrival
and
whenever
one
of
them
had
served
a
customer
she
her
name
beneath
the
others
madame
aurélie
finished
by
deciding
in
marguerite
favour
always
some
injustice
here
muttered
clara
furiously
however
denise
entry
reconciled
these
young
ladies
they
looked
at
her
then
smiled
at
each
other
how
could
a
person
truss
herself
up
in
that
way
the
young
girl
went
and
awkwardly
wrote
her
name
on
the
list
where
she
found
herself
last
meanwhile
madame
aurélie
examined
her
with
an
anxious
pout
and
could
not
help
saying
my
dear
two
like
you
could
get
into
your
dress
you
must
have
it
taken
in
besides
you
do
know
how
to
dress
yourself
come
here
and
let
me
arrange
you
a
bit
then
she
placed
her
before
one
of
the
tall
glasses
alternating
with
the
massive
doors
of
the
cupboards
containing
the
dresses
the
spacious
apartment
surrounded
by
these
mirrors
and
carved
oak
its
floor
covered
with
red
carpet
of
a
large
pattern
resembled
the
commonplace
of
an
hotel
traversed
by
a
continual
stream
of
travellers
the
young
ladies
dressed
in
regulation
silk
and
promenading
their
charms
about
without
ever
sitting
down
on
the
dozen
chairs
reserved
for
the
customers
completed
the
resemblance
between
two
of
their
dress
bodies
they
all
wore
a
long
pencil
with
its
point
in
the
air
and
protruding
from
their
pockets
you
could
see
the
white
leaves
of
a
book
of
several
ventured
to
wear
jewellery
rings
brooches
and
chains
but
their
great
coquetry
the
point
of
display
in
which
given
the
forced
uniformity
of
their
dress
they
all
struggled
for
was
their
hair
hair
ever
overflowing
its
volume
augmented
by
plaits
and
chignons
when
their
own
did
not
suffice
and
combed
curled
and
decked
in
every
possible
fashion
pull
the
waist
down
in
front
said
madame
aurélie
to
denise
there
you
now
have
no
hump
on
your
back
and
your
hair
how
can
you
massacre
it
like
that
it
would
be
superb
if
you
only
took
a
little
trouble
this
was
in
fact
denise
only
beauty
of
a
beautiful
flaxen
hue
it
fell
to
her
ankles
and
when
she
did
it
up
it
was
so
troublesome
that
she
simply
rolled
it
in
a
knot
keeping
it
together
with
the
strong
teeth
of
a
bone
comb
clara
greatly
annoyed
by
the
sight
of
this
abundant
hair
affected
to
laugh
at
it
so
strange
did
it
look
twisted
up
anyhow
with
savage
grace
she
made
a
sign
to
a
saleswoman
in
the
department
a
girl
with
a
broad
face
and
agreeable
manner
the
two
departments
which
adjoined
one
another
were
ever
at
variance
still
the
young
ladies
sometimes
joined
together
in
laughing
at
other
people
mademoiselle
cugnot
just
look
at
that
mane
said
clara
whom
marguerite
was
nudging
also
feigning
to
be
on
the
point
of
bursting
into
laughter
but
mademoiselle
cugnot
was
not
in
the
humour
for
joking
she
had
been
looking
at
denise
for
a
moment
and
remembered
what
she
had
suffered
herself
during
the
first
few
months
after
her
arrival
in
the
establishment
well
what
said
she
everybody
has
got
such
a
mane
as
that
and
thereupon
she
returned
to
her
place
leaving
the
two
others
crestfallen
denise
who
had
heard
everything
followed
her
with
a
glance
of
gratitude
while
madame
aurélie
gave
her
a
book
of
with
her
name
on
it
remarking
you
must
get
yourself
up
better
and
now
try
and
pick
up
the
ways
of
the
house
and
wait
your
turn
for
selling
work
will
be
very
hard
we
shall
be
able
to
judge
of
your
capabilities
despite
her
prophecies
the
department
still
remained
deserted
very
few
customers
came
to
buy
mantles
at
this
early
hour
the
young
ladies
husbanded
their
strength
prudently
preparing
for
the
exertion
of
the
afternoon
denise
intimidated
by
the
thought
that
they
were
watching
her
sharpened
her
pencil
for
the
sake
of
something
to
do
then
imitating
the
others
she
stuck
it
in
her
bosom
between
two
buttonholes
and
summoned
up
all
her
courage
for
it
was
necessary
that
she
should
conquer
a
position
on
the
previous
evening
she
had
been
told
that
she
was
accepted
as
a
probationer
that
is
to
say
without
any
fixed
salary
she
would
simply
have
the
commission
and
allowance
on
what
she
sold
however
she
fully
hoped
to
earn
twelve
hundred
francs
a
year
even
in
this
way
knowing
that
the
good
saleswomen
earned
as
much
as
two
thousand
when
they
liked
to
take
the
trouble
her
expenses
were
regulated
a
hundred
francs
a
month
would
enable
her
to
pay
board
and
lodging
assist
jean
who
did
not
earn
a
sou
and
procure
some
clothes
and
linen
for
herself
only
in
order
to
attain
to
this
large
amount
she
would
have
to
prove
industrious
and
pushing
taking
no
notice
of
the
displayed
by
those
around
her
but
fighting
for
her
share
and
even
snatching
it
from
her
comrades
if
necessary
while
she
was
thus
working
herself
up
for
the
struggle
a
tall
young
man
passing
the
department
smiled
at
her
and
when
she
saw
that
it
was
deloche
who
had
been
engaged
in
the
lace
department
on
the
previous
day
she
returned
his
smile
happy
at
the
friendship
which
thus
presented
itself
and
accepting
his
recognition
as
a
good
omen
at
nine
a
bell
rang
for
the
first
luncheon
then
a
fresh
peal
announced
the
second
and
still
no
customers
appeared
the
madame
frédéric
who
with
the
sulky
harshness
of
widowhood
delighted
in
prophesying
disasters
declared
curtly
that
the
day
was
lost
that
they
would
not
see
a
soul
that
they
might
close
the
cupboards
and
go
away
predictions
which
clouded
the
flat
face
of
marguerite
who
was
eager
to
make
money
whilst
clara
with
her
appearance
already
began
dreaming
of
an
excursion
to
the
woods
of
verrières
should
the
house
really
fail
as
for
madame
aurélie
she
remained
silent
and
serious
promenading
her
cæsarian
countenance
about
the
empty
department
like
a
general
who
has
responsibility
whether
in
victory
or
in
defeat
about
eleven
a
few
ladies
appeared
and
denise
turn
for
serving
had
arrived
when
the
approach
of
a
customer
was
signalled
the
fat
old
girl
from
the
country
you
know
whom
i
mean
murmured
marguerite
to
clara
it
was
a
woman
of
who
occasionally
journeyed
to
paris
from
the
depths
of
some
department
where
she
saved
her
money
up
for
months
together
then
hardly
out
of
the
train
she
made
straight
for
the
ladies
paradise
and
spent
all
her
savings
she
very
rarely
ordered
anything
by
letter
for
she
liked
to
see
and
handle
the
goods
and
would
profit
by
her
journeys
to
lay
in
a
stock
of
everything
even
down
to
needles
which
she
said
were
extremely
dear
in
her
small
town
the
whole
staff
knew
her
was
aware
that
her
name
was
boutarel
and
that
she
lived
at
albi
but
troubled
no
further
about
her
neither
about
her
position
nor
her
mode
of
life
how
do
you
do
madame
graciously
asked
madame
aurélie
who
had
come
forward
and
what
can
we
show
you
you
shall
be
attended
to
at
once
then
turning
round
she
added
now
young
ladies
denise
approached
but
clara
had
sprung
forward
as
a
rule
she
was
very
careless
and
idle
not
caring
about
the
money
she
earned
in
the
shop
as
she
could
get
plenty
outside
however
the
idea
of
doing
the
newcomer
out
of
a
good
customer
spurred
her
on
i
beg
your
pardon
it
my
turn
said
denise
indignantly
madame
aurélie
set
her
aside
with
a
severe
look
exclaiming
there
are
no
turns
i
alone
am
mistress
here
wait
till
you
know
before
serving
our
regular
customers
the
young
girl
retired
and
as
tears
were
coming
to
her
eyes
and
she
wished
to
conceal
her
sensibility
she
turned
her
back
and
stood
up
before
the
window
pretending
to
gaze
into
the
street
were
they
going
to
prevent
her
selling
would
they
all
conspire
to
deprive
her
of
the
important
sales
like
that
fear
for
the
future
came
over
her
she
felt
herself
crushed
between
so
many
contending
interests
yielding
to
the
bitterness
of
her
abandonment
her
forehead
against
the
cold
glass
she
gazed
at
the
old
elbeuf
opposite
thinking
that
she
ought
to
have
implored
her
uncle
to
keep
her
perhaps
he
himself
regretted
his
decision
for
he
had
seemed
to
her
greatly
affected
the
previous
evening
and
now
she
was
quite
alone
in
this
vast
house
where
no
one
cared
for
her
where
she
found
herself
hurtled
lost
pépé
and
jean
who
had
never
left
her
side
were
living
with
strangers
she
was
parted
from
everything
and
the
big
tears
which
she
strove
to
keep
back
made
the
street
dance
before
her
in
a
sort
of
fog
all
this
time
the
hum
of
voices
continued
behind
her
this
one
makes
me
look
a
fright
madame
boutarel
was
saying
you
really
make
a
mistake
madame
said
clara
the
shoulders
fit
perfectly
but
perhaps
you
would
prefer
a
pelisse
to
a
mantle
just
then
denise
started
a
hand
was
laid
on
her
arm
madame
aurélie
addressed
her
severely
well
you
doing
nothing
now
eh
only
looking
at
the
people
passing
things
ca
go
on
like
this
you
know
but
since
i
not
allowed
to
sell
madame
oh
there
other
work
for
you
mademoiselle
begin
at
the
beginning
do
the
in
order
to
please
the
few
customers
who
had
called
they
had
already
been
obliged
to
ransack
the
cupboards
and
on
the
two
long
oaken
tables
to
the
right
and
left
lay
heaps
of
mantles
pelisses
and
capes
garments
of
all
sizes
and
materials
without
replying
denise
began
to
sort
and
fold
them
carefully
and
arrange
them
again
in
the
cupboards
this
was
the
lowest
work
generally
performed
by
beginners
she
ceased
to
protest
however
knowing
that
they
required
the
strictest
obedience
and
prepared
to
wait
until
the
should
be
good
enough
to
let
her
sell
as
she
seemed
at
first
to
have
the
intention
of
doing
she
was
still
folding
when
mouret
appeared
upon
the
scene
to
her
his
arrival
came
as
a
shock
she
blushed
without
knowing
why
and
again
seized
by
a
strange
fear
thinking
that
he
was
going
to
speak
to
her
but
he
did
not
even
see
her
he
no
longer
remembered
the
little
girl
whom
a
momentary
impression
had
induced
him
to
support
madame
aurélie
he
called
curtly
he
was
rather
pale
but
his
eyes
were
clear
and
resolute
in
making
the
tour
of
the
departments
he
had
found
them
empty
and
the
possibility
of
defeat
had
suddenly
presented
itself
before
him
amidst
all
his
obstinate
faith
in
fortune
true
it
was
only
eleven
he
knew
by
experience
that
as
a
rule
the
crowd
never
arrived
much
before
the
afternoon
but
certain
symptoms
troubled
him
on
the
inaugural
days
of
previous
sales
a
general
movement
had
manifested
itself
even
in
the
morning
besides
he
did
not
see
any
of
those
bareheaded
women
customers
living
in
the
neighbourhood
who
usually
dropped
into
his
shop
as
into
a
neighbour
despite
his
habitual
resolution
like
all
great
captains
he
felt
at
the
moment
of
giving
battle
a
superstitious
weakness
growing
on
him
things
would
not
succeed
he
was
lost
and
he
could
not
have
explained
why
yet
he
thought
he
could
read
his
defeat
on
the
faces
of
the
passing
ladies
just
at
that
moment
madame
boutarel
she
who
always
bought
something
turned
away
explaining
no
you
have
nothing
that
pleases
me
i
see
i
decide
later
on
mouret
watched
her
depart
then
as
madame
aurélie
ran
up
at
his
call
he
took
her
aside
and
they
exchanged
a
few
rapid
words
she
waved
her
hands
despairingly
and
was
evidently
admitting
that
things
were
bad
for
a
moment
they
remained
face
to
face
overcome
by
one
of
those
doubts
which
generals
conceal
from
their
soldiers
but
at
last
in
his
brave
way
he
exclaimed
aloud
if
you
want
any
assistance
take
a
girl
from
the
workroom
she
be
a
little
help
to
you
then
he
continued
his
inspection
in
despair
he
had
avoided
bourdoncle
all
the
morning
for
his
assistant
anxious
doubts
irritated
him
however
on
leaving
the
department
where
business
was
still
worse
than
in
the
mantle
gallery
he
suddenly
came
upon
him
and
was
obliged
to
listen
to
the
expression
of
his
fears
still
he
did
not
hesitate
to
send
him
to
the
devil
with
the
brutality
which
he
did
not
spare
even
his
principal
employees
when
things
were
looking
bad
do
keep
quiet
said
he
everything
is
going
on
all
right
i
shall
end
by
pitching
the
tremblers
out
of
doors
then
alone
and
erect
he
took
his
stand
on
the
landing
overlooking
the
central
hall
whence
he
commanded
a
view
of
almost
the
entire
shop
around
him
were
the
departments
beneath
him
those
of
the
up
above
the
emptiness
seemed
in
the
lace
department
an
old
woman
was
having
every
box
searched
and
yet
buying
nothing
whilst
three
minxes
in
the
department
were
slowly
choosing
some
collars
at
eighteen
sous
down
below
in
the
covered
galleries
in
the
rays
of
light
which
come
in
from
the
street
he
noticed
that
customers
were
gradually
becoming
more
numerous
there
was
a
slow
intermittent
procession
wending
its
way
past
the
counters
in
the
mercery
and
the
haberdashery
departments
some
women
of
the
commoner
class
were
pushing
about
still
there
was
hardly
a
soul
among
the
linens
or
the
woollens
the
shop
messengers
in
their
green
with
bright
brass
buttons
were
waiting
for
customers
with
dangling
hands
now
and
again
there
passed
an
inspector
with
a
ceremonious
air
very
stiff
in
his
white
choker
and
mouret
was
especially
grieved
by
the
mortal
silence
which
reigned
in
the
hall
where
the
light
fell
from
a
roofing
through
which
the
sunrays
filtered
in
a
white
diffuse
hovering
dust
whilst
down
below
the
silk
department
seemed
to
be
asleep
in
a
quivering
quietude
a
shopman
footstep
a
few
whispered
words
the
rustling
of
a
passing
skirt
were
the
only
faint
sounds
and
these
the
warm
air
of
the
heating
apparatus
almost
stifled
however
carriages
were
beginning
to
arrive
the
sudden
pulling
up
of
the
horses
was
heard
followed
by
the
banging
of
the
doors
of
the
vehicles
outside
a
distant
tumult
was
commencing
to
rise
inquisitive
folks
were
jostling
in
front
of
the
windows
cabs
were
taking
up
their
positions
on
the
place
gaillon
there
were
all
the
appearances
of
a
crowd
approach
still
on
seeing
the
idle
cashiers
leaning
back
on
their
chairs
behind
their
wickets
and
observing
that
the
with
their
boxes
of
string
and
reams
of
blue
remained
unlittered
mouret
though
indignant
with
himself
for
being
afraid
thought
he
could
feel
his
immense
machine
ceasing
to
work
and
turning
cold
beneath
him
i
say
favier
murmured
hutin
look
at
the
governor
up
there
he
does
seem
to
be
enjoying
himself
oh
this
is
a
rotten
shop
replied
favier
just
fancy
i
not
sold
a
thing
yet
both
of
them
on
the
for
customers
from
time
to
time
whispered
such
short
remarks
as
these
without
looking
at
each
other
the
other
salesmen
of
the
department
were
occupied
in
piling
up
pieces
of
the
paris
delight
under
robineau
orders
whilst
bouthemont
in
full
consultation
with
a
thin
young
woman
seemed
to
be
taking
an
important
order
around
them
on
light
and
elegant
shelves
were
heaps
of
plain
silks
folded
in
long
pieces
of
creamy
paper
and
looking
like
pamphlets
of
an
unusual
size
whilst
encumbering
the
counters
were
fancy
silks
moires
satins
and
velvets
resembling
beds
of
cut
flowers
quite
a
harvest
of
delicate
and
precious
tissues
this
was
the
most
elegant
of
all
the
departments
a
veritable
where
the
goods
so
light
and
airy
seemed
to
be
simply
so
much
luxurious
furnishing
i
must
have
a
hundred
francs
by
sunday
said
hutin
if
i
do
make
an
average
of
twelve
francs
a
day
i
lost
i
reckoned
on
this
sale
by
jove
a
hundred
francs
that
rather
stiff
retorted
favier
i
only
want
fifty
or
sixty
you
must
go
in
for
swell
jollifications
then
oh
no
my
dear
fellow
it
a
stupid
affair
i
made
a
bet
and
lost
so
i
have
to
stand
a
dinner
for
five
persons
two
fellows
and
three
girls
hang
me
i
let
the
first
that
passes
in
for
twenty
yards
of
paris
delight
they
continued
talking
for
a
few
minutes
relating
what
they
had
done
on
the
previous
day
and
what
they
intended
to
do
on
the
ensuing
sunday
favier
followed
the
races
while
hutin
did
a
little
boating
and
patronized
singers
but
they
were
both
possessed
by
the
same
eager
desire
for
money
fighting
for
it
throughout
the
week
and
spending
it
all
on
sunday
it
was
their
sole
thought
in
the
shop
a
thought
which
urged
them
into
an
incessant
and
pitiless
struggle
and
to
think
that
cunning
bouthemont
had
just
managed
to
get
hold
of
madame
sauveur
messenger
the
skinny
woman
with
whom
he
was
talking
that
meant
good
business
three
or
four
dozen
pieces
at
least
for
the
celebrated
dressmaker
always
gave
large
orders
a
moment
before
too
robineau
had
taken
it
into
his
head
to
trick
favier
out
of
a
customer
oh
as
for
that
fellow
we
must
settle
his
hash
said
hutin
who
took
advantage
of
the
slightest
incidents
to
stir
up
the
salesmen
against
the
man
whose
place
he
coveted
ought
the
first
and
second
hands
to
sell
my
word
my
dear
fellow
if
ever
i
become
second
you
see
how
well
i
act
with
the
others
thereupon
with
his
plump
amiable
little
norman
person
he
began
energetically
playing
the
man
favier
could
not
help
casting
a
side
glance
at
him
however
he
retained
his
phlegmatic
air
and
contented
himself
with
replying
yes
i
know
for
my
part
i
should
be
only
too
pleased
then
as
a
lady
came
up
he
added
in
a
lower
tone
look
out
here
one
for
you
it
was
a
lady
with
a
blotchy
face
wearing
a
yellow
bonnet
and
a
red
dress
hutin
immediately
divined
in
her
a
woman
who
would
buy
nothing
so
in
all
haste
he
stooped
behind
the
counter
pretending
to
be
doing
up
his
and
thus
concealed
he
murmured
no
fear
let
some
one
else
take
her
i
do
want
to
lose
my
turn
however
robineau
was
calling
him
whose
turn
gentlemen
monsieur
hutin
where
monsieur
hutin
and
as
that
gentleman
still
gave
no
reply
it
was
the
next
salesman
who
served
the
lady
with
the
blotches
hutin
was
quite
right
she
simply
wanted
some
patterns
with
the
prices
and
she
detained
the
salesman
more
than
ten
minutes
overwhelming
him
with
questions
however
robineau
had
seen
hutin
get
up
from
behind
the
counter
and
so
when
another
customer
arrived
he
interfered
with
a
stern
air
and
stopped
the
young
man
just
as
he
was
rushing
forward
your
turn
has
passed
i
called
you
and
as
you
were
there
behind
but
i
did
hear
you
sir
that
do
write
your
name
at
the
bottom
now
monsieur
favier
your
turn
favier
greatly
amused
at
heart
by
this
adventure
gave
his
friend
a
glance
as
if
to
excuse
himself
hutin
with
pale
lips
had
turned
his
head
away
what
particularly
enraged
him
was
that
he
knew
the
customer
very
well
an
adorable
blonde
who
often
came
to
their
department
and
whom
the
salesmen
called
amongst
themselves
the
pretty
lady
knowing
nothing
of
her
except
her
looks
not
even
her
name
she
always
made
a
good
many
purchases
instructed
a
messenger
to
take
them
to
her
carriage
and
then
immediately
disappeared
tall
elegant
dressed
with
exquisite
taste
she
appeared
to
be
very
rich
and
to
belong
to
the
best
society
well
and
your
hussy
asked
hutin
of
favier
when
the
latter
returned
from
the
whither
he
had
accompanied
the
lady
oh
a
hussy
replied
the
other
no
she
looks
far
too
she
must
be
the
wife
of
a
stockbroker
or
a
doctor
or
something
of
that
sort
do
tell
me
all
the
women
get
themselves
up
so
much
alike
that
it
impossible
to
tell
what
they
are
favier
glanced
at
his
debit
book
i
do
care
he
resumed
stuck
her
for
two
hundred
and
francs
that
makes
nearly
three
francs
for
me
hutin
bit
his
lips
and
vented
his
spleen
on
the
debit
books
another
invention
for
cramming
their
pockets
there
was
a
secret
rivalry
between
these
two
favier
as
a
rule
pretended
to
consider
himself
of
small
account
and
to
recognise
hutin
superiority
but
in
reality
devoured
him
all
the
while
behind
his
back
thus
hutin
was
wild
at
the
thought
of
the
three
francs
pocketed
so
easily
by
a
salesman
whom
he
considered
his
inferior
in
a
fine
day
work
if
it
went
on
like
this
he
would
not
earn
enough
to
pay
for
the
seltzer
water
for
his
sunday
guests
and
in
the
midst
of
the
battle
which
was
now
becoming
fiercer
he
walked
along
the
counters
with
hungry
eyes
eager
for
his
share
jealous
even
of
his
superior
who
was
just
showing
the
thin
young
woman
out
and
saying
to
her
very
well
it
understood
tell
her
i
do
my
best
to
obtain
this
favour
from
monsieur
mouret
mouret
had
quitted
his
post
up
above
some
time
before
suddenly
he
reappeared
on
the
landing
of
the
principal
staircase
which
communicated
with
the
ground
floor
and
here
again
he
commanded
a
view
of
the
whole
establishment
his
face
was
regaining
its
colour
his
faith
was
coming
back
and
increasing
at
sight
of
the
crowd
which
was
gradually
filling
the
place
it
was
the
expected
rush
at
last
the
afternoon
crush
which
in
his
feverishness
he
had
for
a
moment
despaired
of
all
the
shopmen
were
at
their
posts
a
last
ring
of
the
bell
had
announced
the
end
of
the
third
lunch
the
disasters
of
the
morning
due
no
doubt
to
a
shower
which
had
fallen
about
nine
could
still
be
repaired
for
the
blue
sky
of
daybreak
had
come
back
with
its
victorious
gaiety
now
that
the
departments
were
growing
animated
he
was
obliged
to
stand
back
to
make
way
for
the
women
who
were
coming
up
to
the
and
mantle
departments
whilst
behind
him
in
the
lace
and
the
shawl
departments
he
heard
shopmen
and
customers
talking
of
large
sums
but
the
sight
of
the
galleries
on
the
especially
reassured
him
there
was
a
crowd
among
the
haberdashery
and
even
the
linen
and
woollen
departments
were
invaded
the
procession
of
buyers
had
closed
up
and
now
nearly
all
of
them
wore
hats
or
bonnets
it
was
only
here
and
there
that
you
espied
the
white
caps
of
a
few
belated
housewives
in
the
yellow
light
streaming
down
into
the
silk
hall
ladies
had
taken
off
their
gloves
to
feel
the
paris
delight
on
which
they
commented
in
whispers
and
there
was
no
longer
any
mistaking
the
noises
which
came
from
outside
the
rolling
of
cabs
the
banging
of
all
the
increasing
tumult
of
a
growing
crowd
mouret
felt
that
his
machine
was
again
setting
to
work
beneath
him
getting
up
steam
and
reviving
to
activity
from
the
where
gold
was
jingling
and
the
tables
where
messengers
were
hurriedly
packing
up
goods
to
the
in
the
basement
which
was
quickly
filling
with
the
parcels
sent
down
to
it
its
subterraneous
rumble
seeming
to
shake
the
whole
house
and
in
the
midst
of
the
crowd
was
inspector
jouve
walking
about
gravely
on
the
for
thieves
hullo
is
that
you
said
mouret
all
at
once
recognising
paul
de
vallagnosc
whom
a
messenger
was
conducting
to
him
no
no
you
are
not
in
my
way
besides
you
only
to
follow
me
if
you
want
to
see
everything
for
i
stay
in
the
breach
he
still
felt
a
little
anxious
no
doubt
there
were
plenty
of
people
but
would
the
sale
prove
to
be
the
triumph
he
hoped
for
however
he
laughed
with
paul
and
gaily
carried
him
off
things
seem
to
be
picking
up
a
bit
said
hutin
to
favier
but
somehow
i
no
luck
there
are
some
days
that
are
precious
bad
my
word
i
just
made
another
miss
that
old
frump
has
bought
anything
as
he
spoke
he
glanced
towards
a
lady
who
was
walking
off
casting
looks
of
disgust
at
all
the
goods
he
was
not
likely
to
get
fat
on
his
thousand
francs
a
year
unless
he
sold
something
as
a
rule
he
made
seven
or
eight
francs
a
day
in
commission
which
with
his
regular
pay
gave
him
an
average
of
ten
francs
a
day
favier
never
made
much
more
than
eight
and
yet
now
that
animal
was
literally
taking
the
bread
out
of
his
mouth
for
he
had
just
sold
another
dress
to
think
of
it
a
fellow
who
had
never
known
how
to
amuse
a
customer
it
was
exasperating
those
chaps
over
there
seem
to
be
doing
very
well
remarked
favier
speaking
of
the
salesmen
in
the
hosiery
and
haberdashery
departments
but
hutin
who
was
looking
all
round
the
place
suddenly
inquired
do
you
know
madame
desforges
the
governor
sweetheart
look
that
dark
woman
in
the
glove
department
who
is
having
some
gloves
tried
on
by
mignot
he
paused
then
resumed
in
a
low
tone
as
if
speaking
to
mignot
on
whom
he
continued
to
direct
his
eyes
oh
go
on
old
man
you
may
pull
her
fingers
about
as
much
as
you
like
that
wo
do
you
any
good
we
know
your
conquests
there
was
a
rivalry
between
himself
and
the
the
rivalry
of
two
handsome
fellows
who
both
affected
to
flirt
with
the
as
a
matter
of
fact
neither
had
any
real
conquests
to
boast
about
but
they
invented
any
number
of
mysterious
adventures
seeking
to
make
people
believe
in
all
sorts
of
appointments
given
them
by
titled
ladies
between
two
purchases
you
ought
to
get
hold
of
her
said
favier
in
his
sly
artful
way
that
a
good
idea
exclaimed
hutin
if
she
comes
here
i
let
her
in
for
something
extensive
i
want
a
piece
in
the
glove
department
there
was
quite
a
row
of
ladies
seated
before
the
narrow
counter
covered
with
green
velvet
and
edged
with
nickel
silver
and
before
them
the
smiling
shopmen
were
heaping
up
flat
boxes
of
a
bright
pink
taken
out
of
the
counter
itself
and
resembling
the
ticketed
drawers
of
a
secrétaire
mignot
in
particular
was
bending
his
pretty
face
forward
and
striving
to
impart
tender
inflections
to
his
thick
parisian
voice
he
had
already
sold
madame
desforges
a
dozen
pairs
of
kid
gloves
the
paradise
gloves
one
of
the
specialties
of
the
house
she
had
then
asked
for
three
pairs
of
suèdes
and
was
now
trying
on
some
saxon
gloves
for
fear
the
size
should
not
be
exact
oh
the
fit
is
perfect
madame
repeated
mignot
six
and
a
quarter
would
be
too
large
for
a
hand
like
yours
on
the
counter
he
held
her
hand
taking
her
fingers
one
by
one
and
slipping
the
glove
on
with
a
long
renewed
persistently
caressing
touch
looking
at
her
the
while
as
if
he
expected
to
see
in
her
face
some
sign
of
pleasure
but
she
with
her
elbow
on
the
velvet
counter
and
her
wrist
raised
surrendered
her
fingers
to
him
with
the
same
unconcerned
air
as
that
with
which
she
gave
her
foot
to
her
maid
so
that
she
might
button
her
boot
for
her
indeed
he
was
not
a
man
she
utilized
his
services
with
the
disdain
she
always
showed
for
servants
and
did
not
even
look
at
him
i
do
hurt
you
madame
he
inquired
she
replied
no
with
a
shake
of
the
head
the
smell
of
the
saxon
gloves
a
savage
smell
resembling
sugared
musk
troubled
her
as
a
rule
but
seated
at
this
commonplace
counter
she
did
not
notice
it
and
what
next
madame
asked
mignot
nothing
thanks
be
good
enough
to
carry
the
parcel
to
no
for
madame
desforges
being
a
constant
customer
she
gave
her
name
at
a
and
had
each
purchase
sent
there
without
requiring
a
shopman
to
follow
her
when
she
had
gone
away
mignot
turned
towards
his
neighbour
and
winked
and
would
have
liked
him
to
believe
that
some
wonderful
things
had
just
taken
place
meanwhile
madame
desforges
continued
her
purchases
she
turned
to
the
left
stopping
in
the
linen
department
to
procure
some
dusters
then
she
walked
round
and
went
as
far
as
the
woollen
department
at
the
further
end
of
the
gallery
as
she
was
well
pleased
with
her
cook
she
wanted
to
make
her
a
present
of
a
dress
the
woollen
department
overflowed
with
a
compact
crowd
all
the
lower
women
were
there
feeling
the
stuffs
and
absorbed
in
mute
calculations
and
she
was
obliged
to
sit
down
for
a
moment
the
shelves
were
piled
up
with
great
rolls
of
material
which
the
salesmen
took
down
one
by
one
with
a
sudden
pull
they
were
indeed
getting
confused
with
all
the
litter
on
the
counters
where
stuffs
were
mingling
and
slipping
down
it
was
a
sea
of
neutral
tints
the
dull
hues
of
woollens
and
with
here
and
there
a
scotch
tartan
and
a
flannel
showing
brightly
and
the
white
tickets
on
the
pieces
looked
like
a
scanty
shower
of
snow
flakes
dotting
a
dark
december
soil
behind
a
pile
of
poplin
liénard
was
joking
with
a
tall
girl
a
of
the
neigbourhood
sent
by
her
mistress
to
match
some
merino
he
detested
these
days
which
tired
him
to
death
and
endeavoured
to
shirk
his
work
getting
plenty
of
money
from
his
father
and
not
caring
a
fig
about
the
business
but
doing
only
just
enough
to
avoid
being
dismissed
listen
to
me
mademoiselle
fanny
he
was
saying
you
are
always
in
a
hurry
did
the
striped
vicuna
suit
the
other
day
i
shall
come
and
see
you
and
ask
for
my
commission
mind
but
the
girl
ran
off
laughing
and
liénard
found
himself
before
madame
desforges
whom
he
could
not
help
asking
what
can
i
serve
you
with
madame
she
wanted
a
dress
not
too
dear
but
yet
of
strong
stuff
liénard
with
the
view
of
sparing
his
arms
which
was
his
principal
thought
manœuvred
so
as
to
make
her
take
one
of
the
stuffs
already
unfolded
on
the
counter
there
were
cashmeres
serges
and
vicunas
there
and
he
declared
that
there
was
nothing
better
to
be
had
for
you
could
never
wear
them
out
however
none
of
these
seemed
to
satisfy
her
on
one
of
the
shelves
she
had
observed
a
blue
shalloon
which
she
wished
to
see
so
he
made
up
his
mind
at
last
and
took
down
the
roll
but
she
thought
the
material
too
rough
then
he
showed
her
a
cheviot
some
diagonals
some
greys
every
sort
of
woollens
which
she
felt
out
of
curiosity
just
for
the
pleasure
of
doing
so
decided
at
heart
to
take
no
matter
what
the
young
man
was
thus
obliged
to
empty
the
highest
shelves
his
shoulders
cracked
and
the
counter
vanished
under
the
silky
grain
of
the
cashmeres
and
poplins
the
rough
nap
of
the
cheviots
and
the
tufty
down
of
the
vicunas
there
were
samples
of
every
material
and
every
tint
though
she
had
not
the
least
wish
to
buy
any
she
even
asked
to
see
some
grenadine
and
some
chambéry
gauze
then
when
she
had
seen
enough
she
remarked
oh
after
all
the
first
is
the
best
it
for
my
cook
yes
the
narrow
ribbed
serge
the
one
at
two
francs
and
when
liénard
had
measured
it
pale
with
suppressed
anger
she
added
have
the
goodness
to
take
that
to
no
for
madame
desforges
just
as
she
was
going
away
she
recognised
madame
marty
near
her
accompanied
by
her
daughter
valentine
a
tall
girl
of
fourteen
thin
and
bold
who
already
cast
a
woman
covetous
looks
on
the
materials
ah
it
you
dear
madame
yes
dear
madame
what
a
crowd
is
it
not
oh
do
speak
of
it
it
stifling
and
such
a
success
have
you
seen
the
oriental
saloon
superb
wonderful
thereupon
amidst
all
the
jostling
pushed
hither
and
thither
by
the
growing
crowd
of
modest
purses
rushing
upon
the
cheap
woollen
goods
they
went
into
ecstasies
over
the
exhibition
of
eastern
carpets
and
afterwards
madame
marty
explained
that
she
was
looking
for
some
material
for
a
mantle
but
she
had
not
quite
made
up
her
mind
and
wanted
to
see
some
woollen
look
mamma
murmured
valentine
it
too
common
come
to
the
silk
department
then
said
madame
desforges
you
must
see
their
famous
paris
delight
madame
marty
hesitated
for
a
moment
it
would
be
very
dear
and
she
had
faithfully
promised
her
husband
to
be
reasonable
she
had
been
buying
for
an
hour
quite
a
pile
of
articles
was
following
her
already
a
muff
and
some
quilling
for
herself
and
some
stockings
for
her
daughter
she
finished
by
saying
to
the
shopman
who
was
showing
her
the
well
no
i
going
to
the
silk
department
you
nothing
to
suit
me
the
shopman
then
took
up
the
articles
already
purchased
and
walked
off
before
the
ladies
in
the
silk
department
there
was
also
a
crowd
the
principal
crush
being
opposite
the
inside
display
arranged
by
hutin
to
which
mouret
had
given
the
finishing
touches
this
was
at
the
further
end
of
the
hall
around
one
of
the
slender
columns
which
supported
the
glass
roof
a
perfect
torrent
of
material
a
billowy
cascade
fell
from
above
spreading
out
more
and
more
as
it
neared
the
floor
the
bright
satins
and
silks
the
reine
and
renaissance
satins
with
the
pearly
tones
of
spring
water
the
light
silks
and
all
of
crystalline
transparency
flowed
forth
above
then
came
the
stronger
fabrics
merveilleux
satins
and
duchess
silks
rolling
in
waves
of
increasing
volume
whilst
at
the
bottom
as
in
a
the
heavy
materials
the
figured
armures
the
damasks
and
brocades
the
beaded
silks
and
the
silk
embroidered
with
gold
and
silver
reposed
amidst
a
deep
bed
of
velvet
of
every
sort
black
white
and
coloured
with
patterns
stamped
on
silk
and
satin
grounds
and
spreading
out
with
their
medley
of
colours
like
a
still
lake
in
which
reflections
of
sky
and
scenery
were
seemingly
dancing
the
women
pale
with
desire
bent
over
as
if
to
look
at
themselves
in
a
mirror
and
before
this
gushing
cataract
they
all
remained
hesitating
between
a
secret
fear
of
being
carried
away
by
such
a
flood
of
luxury
and
an
irresistible
desire
to
jump
in
and
be
lost
in
it
here
you
are
then
said
madame
desforges
on
finding
madame
bourdelais
installed
before
a
counter
ah
good
day
replied
the
latter
shaking
hands
with
the
other
ladies
yes
i
come
to
have
a
look
what
a
prodigious
exhibition
it
like
a
dream
and
the
oriental
saloon
have
you
seen
the
oriental
saloon
yes
yes
extraordinary
but
beneath
this
enthusiasm
which
was
decidedly
to
be
the
fashionable
note
of
the
day
madame
bourdelais
retained
her
practical
housewifely
coolness
she
was
carefully
examining
a
piece
of
paris
delight
for
she
had
come
on
purpose
to
profit
by
the
exceptional
cheapness
of
this
silk
if
she
found
it
really
advantageous
she
was
doubtless
satisfied
with
it
for
she
bought
yards
hoping
that
this
quantity
would
prove
sufficient
to
make
a
dress
for
herself
and
a
cloak
for
her
little
girl
what
you
are
going
already
resumed
madame
desforges
take
a
walk
round
with
us
no
thanks
they
are
waiting
for
me
at
home
i
did
like
to
risk
bringing
the
children
into
this
crowd
thereupon
she
went
away
preceded
by
the
salesman
carrying
the
yards
of
silk
who
led
her
to
no
where
young
albert
was
getting
confused
by
all
the
demands
for
invoices
with
which
he
was
besieged
when
the
salesman
was
able
to
approach
after
having
inscribed
his
sale
on
a
he
called
out
the
item
which
the
cashier
entered
in
a
register
then
it
was
checked
and
the
leaf
torn
out
of
the
salesman
debit
book
was
stuck
on
a
file
near
the
receipting
stamp
one
hundred
and
forty
francs
said
albert
madame
bourdelais
paid
and
gave
her
address
for
having
come
on
foot
she
did
not
wish
to
be
troubled
with
a
parcel
joseph
had
already
received
the
silk
behind
the
and
was
tying
it
up
and
then
the
parcel
thrown
into
a
basket
on
wheels
was
sent
down
to
the
delivery
department
which
seemed
to
swallow
up
all
the
goods
in
the
shop
with
a
roar
meanwhile
the
block
was
becoming
so
great
in
the
silk
department
that
madame
desforges
and
madame
marty
could
not
find
a
salesman
disengaged
so
they
remained
standing
mingling
with
the
crowd
of
ladies
who
were
looking
at
the
silks
and
feeling
them
staying
there
for
hours
without
making
up
their
minds
however
the
paris
delight
proved
the
great
success
around
it
pressed
one
of
those
crowds
whose
feverish
infatuation
decrees
a
fashion
in
a
day
a
host
of
shopmen
were
engaged
in
measuring
off
this
silk
above
the
customers
heads
you
could
see
the
pale
glimmer
of
the
unfolded
pieces
as
the
fingers
of
the
employees
came
and
went
along
the
oak
yard
measures
hanging
from
brass
rods
and
you
could
hear
the
noise
of
scissors
swiftly
cutting
the
silk
as
fast
as
it
was
unwound
as
if
indeed
there
were
not
shopmen
enough
to
suffice
for
all
the
greedy
outstretched
hands
of
the
purchasers
it
really
is
bad
for
five
francs
sixty
centimes
said
madame
desforges
who
had
succeeded
in
getting
hold
of
a
piece
at
the
edge
of
the
table
madame
marty
and
her
daughter
experienced
some
disappointment
however
the
newspapers
had
said
so
much
about
this
silk
that
they
had
expected
something
stronger
and
more
brilliant
however
bouthemont
had
just
recognised
madame
desforges
and
anxious
to
pay
his
court
to
such
a
handsome
lady
who
was
supposed
to
be
with
the
governor
he
came
forward
with
rather
coarse
amiability
what
no
one
was
serving
her
it
was
unpardonable
he
begged
her
to
be
indulgent
for
really
they
did
not
know
which
way
to
turn
and
then
he
began
to
look
for
some
chairs
amongst
the
neighbouring
skirts
laughing
the
while
with
his
laugh
full
of
a
brutal
love
for
the
sex
which
did
not
seem
to
displease
henriette
i
say
murmured
favier
as
he
went
to
take
some
velvet
from
a
shelf
behind
hutin
there
bouthemont
making
up
to
your
mash
beside
himself
with
rage
with
an
old
lady
who
after
keeping
him
a
quarter
of
an
hour
had
finished
by
buying
a
yard
of
black
satin
for
a
pair
of
stays
hutin
had
quite
forgotten
madame
desforges
in
busy
moments
they
took
no
notice
of
the
turns
each
salesman
served
the
customers
as
they
arrived
and
he
was
answering
madame
boutarel
who
was
finishing
her
afternoon
at
the
ladies
paradise
where
she
had
already
spent
three
hours
in
the
morning
when
favier
warning
made
him
start
what
was
he
going
to
miss
the
governor
sweetheart
from
whom
he
had
sworn
to
extract
a
piece
for
himself
that
would
be
the
height
of
for
he
had
made
three
francs
as
yet
with
all
those
other
chignons
who
were
mooning
about
the
place
bouthemont
was
just
then
calling
out
loudly
come
gentlemen
some
one
this
way
thereupon
hutin
passed
madame
boutarel
over
to
robineau
who
was
doing
nothing
here
the
madame
he
will
answer
you
better
than
i
can
and
he
rushed
off
to
take
madame
marty
purchases
from
the
woollen
salesman
who
had
accompanied
the
ladies
that
day
a
nervous
excitement
must
have
interfered
with
his
usually
keen
scent
as
a
rule
the
first
glance
told
him
if
a
customer
meant
to
buy
and
how
much
then
he
domineered
over
the
customer
hastened
to
serve
her
so
as
to
pass
on
to
another
imposing
his
choice
upon
her
and
persuading
her
that
he
knew
better
than
herself
what
material
she
required
what
sort
of
silk
madame
he
asked
in
his
most
gallant
manner
and
madame
desforges
had
no
sooner
opened
her
mouth
than
he
added
i
know
i
got
just
what
you
want
when
the
piece
of
paris
delight
was
unfolded
on
a
corner
of
the
counter
between
heaps
of
other
silks
madame
marty
and
her
daughter
approached
hutin
rather
anxious
understood
that
it
was
at
first
a
question
of
serving
these
two
whispered
words
were
exchanged
madame
desforges
was
advising
her
friend
oh
certainly
she
murmured
a
silk
at
five
francs
twelve
sous
will
never
equal
one
at
fifteen
or
even
ten
it
is
very
light
repeated
madame
marty
i
afraid
that
it
has
not
sufficient
body
for
a
mantle
this
remark
induced
the
salesman
to
intervene
he
smiled
with
the
exaggerated
politeness
of
a
man
who
can
not
make
a
mistake
but
flexibility
madame
is
the
chief
quality
of
this
silk
it
will
not
crimple
it
exactly
what
you
require
impressed
by
such
an
assurance
the
ladies
said
no
more
they
had
taken
the
silk
up
and
were
again
examining
it
when
they
felt
a
touch
on
their
shoulders
it
was
madame
guibal
who
had
been
slowly
walking
about
the
shop
for
an
hour
past
feasting
her
eyes
on
all
the
assembled
riches
but
not
buying
so
much
as
a
yard
of
calico
and
now
there
was
another
explosion
of
gossip
what
is
that
you
yes
it
i
rather
knocked
about
though
what
a
crowd
eh
one
ca
get
about
and
the
oriental
saloon
ravishing
good
heavens
what
a
success
stay
a
moment
we
will
go
upstairs
together
no
thanks
i
just
come
down
hutin
was
waiting
concealing
his
impatience
beneath
a
smile
that
did
not
quit
his
lips
were
they
going
to
keep
him
there
long
really
the
women
took
things
very
coolly
it
was
like
stealing
money
out
of
his
pocket
at
last
however
madame
guibal
went
off
to
resume
her
stroll
turning
round
the
large
display
of
silks
with
an
enraptured
air
well
if
i
were
you
i
should
buy
the
mantle
said
madame
desforges
suddenly
returning
to
the
paris
delight
it
wo
cost
you
so
much
it
true
that
the
trimmings
and
murmured
madame
marty
besides
one
has
more
choice
all
three
had
risen
madame
desforges
turning
to
hutin
said
to
him
have
the
goodness
to
show
us
to
the
mantle
department
he
remained
dumbfounded
unaccustomed
as
he
was
to
such
defeats
what
the
dark
lady
bought
nothing
had
he
made
a
mistake
then
abandoning
madame
marty
he
thereupon
attacked
madame
desforges
exerting
all
his
ability
as
a
salesman
on
her
and
you
madame
would
you
not
like
to
see
our
satins
our
velvets
we
have
some
extraordinary
bargains
thanks
another
time
she
coolly
replied
looking
at
him
no
more
than
she
had
looked
at
mignot
hutin
had
to
take
up
madame
marty
purchases
and
walk
off
before
the
ladies
to
show
them
to
the
mantle
department
but
he
also
had
the
grief
of
seeing
that
robineau
was
selling
madame
boutarel
a
large
quantity
of
silk
decidedly
his
scent
was
playing
him
false
he
would
make
four
sous
beneath
the
amiable
propriety
of
his
manners
his
heart
swelled
with
the
rage
of
a
man
robbed
and
devoured
by
others
on
the
first
floor
ladies
said
he
without
ceasing
to
smile
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
reach
the
staircase
a
compact
crowd
of
heads
was
surging
under
the
galleries
and
expanding
like
an
overflowing
river
in
the
middle
of
the
hall
quite
a
battle
of
business
was
going
on
the
salesmen
had
this
population
of
women
at
their
mercy
and
passed
them
on
from
one
to
another
with
feverish
haste
the
moment
of
the
formidable
afternoon
rush
when
the
machine
led
its
customers
such
a
feverish
dance
extracting
money
from
their
very
flesh
had
at
last
arrived
in
the
silk
department
especially
a
gust
of
folly
seemed
to
reign
the
paris
delight
had
brought
such
a
crowd
together
that
for
several
minutes
hutin
could
not
advance
a
step
and
henriette
having
raised
her
eyes
to
the
summit
of
the
stairs
there
beheld
mouret
who
ever
returned
thither
as
to
a
favourite
position
from
which
he
could
view
victory
she
smiled
hoping
that
he
would
come
down
and
extricate
her
but
he
did
not
even
recognise
her
in
the
crowd
he
was
still
with
vallagnosc
showing
him
the
establishment
his
face
beaming
with
triumph
the
while
the
trepidation
within
was
now
stifling
all
outside
noise
you
no
longer
heard
the
rumbling
of
the
vehicles
nor
the
banging
of
their
doors
apart
from
the
loud
buzzing
of
the
sales
nought
remained
but
a
consciousness
that
the
immensity
of
paris
stretched
all
around
an
immensity
which
would
always
furnish
buyers
in
the
heavy
still
air
in
which
the
fumes
of
the
heating
apparatus
heightened
the
odours
of
the
stuffs
there
was
an
increasing
hubbub
compounded
of
all
sorts
of
noises
of
continual
tramping
of
phrases
a
hundred
times
repeated
around
the
counters
of
gold
jingling
on
the
brass
tablets
of
the
which
a
legion
of
purses
besieged
and
of
baskets
on
wheels
laden
with
parcels
which
were
constantly
disappearing
into
the
gaping
cellars
and
amidst
the
fine
dust
everything
finished
by
getting
mixed
it
became
impossible
to
recognise
the
divisions
of
the
different
departments
the
haberdashery
department
over
yonder
seemed
submerged
further
on
in
the
linen
department
a
ray
of
sunshine
entering
by
a
window
facing
the
rue
looked
like
a
golden
dart
in
a
mass
of
snow
while
among
the
gloves
and
woollens
a
dense
mass
of
bonnets
and
chignons
hid
the
background
of
the
shop
from
view
even
the
toilettes
could
no
longer
be
distinctly
seen
the
alone
appeared
decked
with
feathers
and
ribbons
while
a
few
men
hats
here
and
there
showed
like
black
spots
and
the
complexions
pale
with
fatigue
and
heat
assumed
the
transparency
of
camelias
at
last
hutin
thanks
to
his
vigorous
elbows
was
able
to
open
a
way
for
the
ladies
by
keeping
in
front
of
them
but
on
reaching
the
landing
henriette
no
longer
found
mouret
there
for
he
had
just
plunged
vallagnosc
into
the
midst
of
the
crowd
in
order
to
complete
his
bewilderment
he
himself
too
feeling
the
need
of
a
dip
into
this
bath
of
success
he
lost
his
breath
with
rapture
feeling
the
while
a
kind
of
continuous
caress
from
all
his
customers
to
the
left
ladies
said
hutin
still
attentive
despite
his
increasing
exasperation
up
above
however
there
was
the
same
block
people
invaded
even
the
furnishing
department
usually
the
quietest
of
all
the
shawl
the
fur
and
the
departments
literally
swarmed
with
customers
and
as
the
ladies
crossed
the
lace
gallery
another
meeting
took
place
madame
de
boves
was
there
with
her
daughter
blanche
both
buried
amidst
the
articles
which
deloche
was
showing
them
and
again
hutin
had
to
make
a
halt
parcel
in
hand
good
afternoon
i
was
just
thinking
of
you
i
been
looking
for
you
myself
but
how
can
you
expect
to
find
any
one
in
this
crowd
it
magnificent
is
it
dazzling
my
dear
we
can
hardly
stand
and
you
buying
oh
no
we
only
looking
round
it
rests
us
a
little
to
be
seated
as
a
fact
madame
de
boves
with
scarcely
more
than
her
in
her
purse
was
having
all
sorts
of
laces
handed
down
simply
for
the
pleasure
of
seeing
and
handling
them
she
had
guessed
deloche
to
be
a
new
salesman
slow
and
awkward
who
dared
not
resist
a
whims
and
she
had
taken
advantage
of
his
bewildered
to
keep
him
there
for
half
an
hour
still
asking
for
fresh
articles
the
counter
was
covered
and
she
plunged
her
hands
into
an
increasing
mountain
of
lace
malines
valenciennes
and
chantilly
her
fingers
trembling
with
desire
her
face
gradually
warming
with
a
sensual
delight
whilst
blanche
close
to
her
agitated
by
the
same
passion
was
very
pale
her
flesh
inflated
and
flabby
however
the
conversation
continued
and
hutin
standing
there
waiting
their
good
pleasure
could
have
slapped
their
faces
for
all
the
time
they
were
making
him
lose
ah
said
madame
marty
you
looking
at
some
cravats
and
handkerchiefs
like
those
i
showed
you
the
other
day
this
was
true
madame
de
boves
tormented
by
madame
marty
lace
ever
since
the
previous
saturday
had
been
unable
to
resist
the
desire
to
at
least
handle
some
like
it
since
the
meagre
allowance
which
her
husband
made
her
did
not
permit
her
to
carry
any
away
she
blushed
slightly
explaining
that
blanche
had
wished
to
see
the
cravats
then
she
added
you
going
to
the
mantles
well
we
see
you
again
shall
we
say
in
the
oriental
saloon
that
it
in
the
oriental
saloon
superb
is
it
then
they
separated
enraptured
amidst
the
obstruction
which
the
sale
of
insertions
and
small
trimmings
at
low
prices
was
causing
deloche
glad
to
be
occupied
again
began
emptying
the
boxes
before
the
mother
and
daughter
and
amidst
the
groups
pressing
close
to
the
counters
inspector
jouve
slowly
walked
about
with
his
military
air
displaying
his
decoration
and
watching
over
all
the
fine
and
precious
goods
so
easy
to
conceal
up
a
sleeve
when
he
passed
behind
madame
de
boves
surprised
to
see
her
with
her
arms
plunged
in
such
a
heap
of
lace
he
cast
a
quick
glance
at
her
feverish
hands
to
the
right
ladies
said
hutin
resuming
his
march
he
was
beside
himself
with
rage
was
it
not
enough
that
he
had
missed
a
sale
down
below
now
they
kept
on
delaying
him
at
each
turn
of
the
shop
and
with
his
annoyance
was
blended
no
little
of
the
rancour
that
existed
between
the
textile
and
the
departments
which
were
in
continual
hostility
ever
fighting
for
customers
and
stealing
each
other
percentages
and
commissions
those
of
the
silk
hall
were
yet
more
enraged
than
those
of
the
woollen
department
whenever
a
lady
decided
to
take
a
mantle
after
looking
at
numerous
taffetas
and
failles
and
they
were
obliged
to
conduct
her
to
madame
aurélie
gallery
mademoiselle
vadon
said
hutin
in
an
angry
voice
when
he
at
last
arrived
in
the
department
but
mademoiselle
vadon
passed
by
without
listening
absorbed
in
a
sale
which
she
was
conducting
the
room
was
full
a
stream
of
people
were
crossing
it
entering
by
the
door
of
the
lace
department
and
leaving
by
that
of
the
department
whilst
on
the
right
were
customers
trying
on
garments
and
posing
before
the
mirrors
the
red
carpet
stifled
all
noise
of
footsteps
here
and
the
distant
roar
from
the
died
away
giving
place
to
a
discreet
murmur
and
a
warmth
increased
by
the
presence
of
so
many
women
mademoiselle
prunaire
cried
out
hutin
and
as
she
also
took
no
notice
of
him
he
added
between
his
teeth
so
as
not
to
be
heard
a
set
of
jades
he
was
certainly
not
fond
of
them
tired
to
death
as
he
was
by
climbing
the
stairs
to
bring
them
customers
and
furious
at
the
profits
which
he
accused
them
of
taking
out
of
his
pocket
it
was
a
secret
warfare
into
which
the
young
ladies
themselves
entered
with
equal
fierceness
and
in
their
mutual
weariness
always
on
foot
and
worked
to
death
all
difference
of
sex
disappeared
and
nothing
remained
but
their
contending
interests
irritated
by
the
fever
of
business
so
there
no
one
here
to
serve
asked
hutin
but
he
suddenly
caught
sight
of
denise
she
had
been
kept
folding
all
the
morning
only
allowed
to
serve
a
few
doubtful
customers
to
whom
moreover
she
had
not
sold
anything
when
hutin
recognised
her
occupied
in
clearing
an
enormous
heap
of
garments
off
the
counters
he
ran
up
to
her
look
here
mademoiselle
serve
these
ladies
who
are
waiting
thereupon
he
quickly
slipped
madame
marty
purchases
into
her
arms
tired
as
he
was
of
carrying
them
about
his
smile
returned
to
him
but
it
was
instinct
with
the
secret
maliciousness
of
the
experienced
salesman
who
shrewdly
guessed
into
what
an
awkward
position
he
had
just
thrown
both
the
ladies
and
the
young
girl
the
latter
however
remained
quite
perturbed
by
the
prospect
of
this
sale
which
suddenly
presented
itself
for
the
second
time
hutin
appeared
to
her
as
an
unknown
friend
fraternal
and
always
ready
to
spring
out
of
the
darkness
to
save
her
her
eyes
glistened
with
gratitude
she
followed
him
with
a
lingering
look
whilst
he
began
elbowing
his
way
as
fast
as
possible
towards
his
department
i
want
a
mantle
said
madame
marty
then
denise
questioned
her
what
style
of
mantle
but
the
lady
had
no
idea
she
wished
to
see
what
the
house
had
got
and
the
young
girl
already
very
tired
bewildered
by
the
crowd
quite
lost
her
head
she
had
never
served
any
but
the
rare
customers
who
came
to
cornaille
at
valognes
she
did
not
even
know
the
number
of
the
models
nor
their
places
in
the
cupboards
and
so
she
was
hardly
able
to
reply
to
the
ladies
who
were
beginning
to
lose
patience
when
madame
aurélie
perceived
madame
desforges
of
whose
connection
with
mouret
she
was
no
doubt
aware
for
she
hastened
up
and
asked
with
a
smile
are
these
ladies
being
served
yes
that
young
person
over
there
is
attending
to
us
replied
henriette
but
she
does
not
appear
to
be
very
well
up
to
her
work
she
ca
find
anything
at
this
the
completely
paralyzed
denise
by
stepping
up
to
her
and
saying
in
a
whisper
you
see
very
well
you
know
nothing
do
interfere
any
more
please
then
turning
round
she
called
out
mademoiselle
vadon
these
ladies
require
a
mantle
she
remained
looking
on
whilst
marguerite
showed
the
models
this
girl
assumed
a
dry
polite
voice
with
customers
the
disagreeable
manner
of
a
young
person
robed
in
silk
accustomed
to
rub
against
elegance
in
every
form
and
full
unknown
to
herself
of
jealousy
and
rancour
when
she
heard
madame
marty
say
that
she
did
not
wish
to
pay
more
than
two
hundred
francs
she
made
a
grimace
of
pity
oh
madame
would
certainly
give
more
for
it
would
be
impossible
to
find
anything
at
all
suitable
for
two
hundred
francs
then
she
threw
some
of
the
common
mantles
on
a
counter
with
a
gesture
which
signified
just
see
they
pitiful
madame
marty
dared
not
think
them
nice
after
that
but
bent
over
to
murmur
in
madame
desforges
ear
do
you
prefer
to
be
served
by
men
one
feels
more
comfortable
at
last
marguerite
brought
a
silk
mantle
trimmed
with
jet
which
she
treated
with
respect
and
thereupon
madame
aurélie
abruptly
called
denise
come
do
something
at
all
events
just
put
that
on
your
shoulders
denise
wounded
to
the
heart
despairing
of
ever
succeeding
had
remained
motionless
her
hands
dangling
by
her
side
no
doubt
she
would
be
sent
away
and
the
children
would
be
without
food
all
the
tumult
of
the
crowd
buzzed
in
her
head
her
legs
were
tottering
and
her
arms
bruised
by
the
handling
of
so
many
garments
a
porter
work
which
she
had
never
done
before
however
she
was
obliged
to
obey
and
allow
marguerite
to
put
the
mantle
on
her
as
on
a
dummy
stand
upright
said
madame
aurélie
but
a
moment
afterwards
denise
was
forgotten
mouret
had
just
come
in
with
vallagnosc
and
bourdoncle
and
he
bowed
to
the
ladies
who
complimented
him
on
his
magnificent
exhibition
of
winter
novelties
of
course
they
went
into
raptures
over
the
oriental
saloon
vallagnosc
who
was
finishing
his
walk
through
the
departments
displayed
more
surprise
than
admiration
for
after
all
thought
he
with
his
pessimist
nonchalance
it
was
nothing
more
than
an
immense
collection
of
drapery
bourdoncle
however
forgetting
that
he
himself
belonged
to
the
establishment
likewise
congratulated
the
governor
in
order
to
make
him
forget
his
anxious
doubts
and
persecutions
of
the
earlier
part
of
the
day
yes
yes
things
are
going
on
very
well
i
quite
satisfied
repeated
mouret
radiant
replying
with
a
smile
to
madame
loving
looks
but
i
must
not
interrupt
you
ladies
then
all
eyes
were
again
turned
on
denise
she
placed
herself
entirely
in
the
hands
of
marguerite
who
was
making
her
turn
round
what
do
you
think
of
it
eh
asked
madame
marty
of
madame
desforges
the
latter
gave
her
opinion
like
a
supreme
umpire
of
fashion
it
is
bad
the
cut
is
original
but
it
does
seem
to
me
very
graceful
about
the
waist
oh
interrupted
madame
aurélie
it
must
be
seen
on
the
lady
herself
you
can
understand
it
does
not
have
much
effect
on
this
young
person
who
is
so
slim
hold
up
your
head
mademoiselle
give
the
mantle
all
its
importance
they
smiled
denise
had
turned
very
pale
she
felt
ashamed
at
being
thus
turned
into
a
machine
which
they
examined
and
joked
about
so
freely
madame
desforges
yielding
to
the
natural
antipathy
of
a
contrary
nature
annoyed
by
the
girl
gentle
face
maliciously
added
no
doubt
it
would
set
better
if
the
young
person
gown
were
not
so
thereupon
she
cast
at
mouret
the
mocking
glance
of
a
parisienne
amused
by
the
ridiculous
rig
of
a
country
girl
he
felt
the
amorous
caress
of
this
glance
the
triumph
of
a
woman
proud
of
her
beauty
and
her
art
and
so
out
of
pure
gratitude
the
gratitude
of
a
man
who
knew
himself
to
be
adored
he
felt
obliged
to
joke
in
his
turn
despite
his
towards
denise
of
whose
secret
charm
he
was
conscious
besides
her
hair
should
be
combed
he
murmured
this
was
the
last
straw
the
director
deigned
to
laugh
so
all
the
young
ladies
ventured
to
do
the
same
marguerite
risked
a
slight
chuckle
like
a
girl
who
restrains
herself
but
clara
left
a
customer
so
as
to
enjoy
the
fun
at
her
ease
and
even
some
saleswomen
of
the
department
came
in
attracted
by
the
talking
as
for
the
lady
customers
they
took
it
more
quietly
with
an
air
of
enjoyment
madame
aurélie
was
the
only
one
who
did
not
smile
it
was
as
if
denise
splendid
hair
and
slender
virginal
shoulders
had
dishonoured
her
compromised
the
good
reputation
of
her
department
denise
herself
had
turned
paler
still
amidst
all
these
people
who
were
laughing
at
her
she
felt
herself
violated
exposed
to
all
their
hostile
glances
without
defence
what
had
she
done
that
they
should
thus
attack
her
spare
figure
and
her
too
luxuriant
hair
but
she
was
especially
wounded
by
madame
desforges
and
mouret
laughter
instinctively
divining
their
connection
and
her
heart
sinking
with
an
unknown
grief
that
lady
was
surely
very
to
attack
a
poor
girl
who
had
said
nothing
and
as
for
mouret
he
most
decidedly
filled
her
with
a
freezing
fear
in
which
all
her
other
sentiments
disappeared
and
totally
abandoned
assailed
in
her
most
cherished
feelings
of
modesty
indignant
at
such
injustice
she
was
obliged
to
stifle
the
sobs
which
were
rising
in
her
throat
i
should
think
so
let
her
comb
her
hair
said
the
terrible
bourdoncle
to
madame
aurélie
full
of
scorn
for
denise
small
limbs
he
had
condemned
her
the
first
time
he
had
seen
her
at
last
the
came
and
took
the
mantle
off
denise
shoulders
saying
to
her
in
a
low
tone
well
mademoiselle
here
a
fine
start
really
if
this
is
the
way
you
show
your
capabilities
it
is
impossible
to
be
more
stupid
fearing
that
her
tears
might
gush
from
her
eyes
denise
hastened
back
to
the
heap
of
garments
which
she
began
sorting
on
the
counter
there
at
least
she
was
lost
in
the
crowd
fatigue
prevented
her
from
thinking
but
all
at
once
near
by
she
perceived
the
saleswoman
of
the
department
who
had
already
defended
her
that
morning
the
latter
had
followed
the
scene
and
murmured
in
her
ear
my
poor
child
you
must
be
so
sensitive
keep
that
to
yourself
or
they
go
on
worse
and
worse
i
come
from
chartres
yes
pauline
cugnot
is
my
name
and
my
parents
are
millers
well
the
girls
here
would
have
devoured
me
during
the
first
few
days
if
i
had
not
stood
up
firm
come
be
brave
give
me
your
hand
we
have
a
talk
together
whenever
you
like
this
outstretched
hand
redoubled
denise
confusion
she
shook
it
furtively
and
hastened
to
take
up
a
load
of
cloaks
fearing
lest
she
might
again
be
accused
of
a
transgression
and
receive
a
scolding
if
it
were
known
she
had
a
friend
however
madame
aurélie
herself
had
just
put
the
mantle
on
madame
marty
and
they
all
exclaimed
oh
how
nice
delightful
it
at
once
looked
quite
different
madame
desforges
decided
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
improve
on
it
a
good
deal
of
bowing
ensued
mouret
took
his
leave
whilst
vallagnosc
who
had
perceived
madame
de
boves
and
her
daughter
in
the
lace
department
hastened
to
offer
his
arm
to
the
former
marguerite
standing
before
one
of
the
was
already
calling
out
the
different
purchases
made
by
madame
marty
who
settled
for
them
and
ordered
the
parcel
to
be
taken
to
her
cab
madame
desforges
had
found
her
articles
at
no
then
the
ladies
met
once
more
in
the
oriental
saloon
they
were
leaving
but
it
was
amidst
a
loquacious
outburst
of
admiration
even
madame
guibal
became
enthusiastic
oh
delicious
it
makes
you
think
you
are
in
the
east
does
it
a
real
harem
and
not
at
all
dear
and
the
smyrnas
oh
the
smyrnas
what
tones
what
delicacy
and
that
kurdestan
just
look
a
real
delacroix
the
crowd
was
thinning
the
bell
at
an
hour
interval
had
already
announced
the
first
two
dinners
the
third
was
about
to
be
served
and
in
the
departments
there
now
only
remained
a
few
lingering
customers
whose
fever
for
spending
money
had
made
them
forget
the
time
outside
nothing
was
heard
but
the
rolling
of
the
last
cabs
breaking
upon
the
husky
voice
of
paris
a
snort
like
that
of
a
satiated
ogre
digesting
all
the
linens
and
cloths
silks
and
laces
with
which
he
had
been
gorged
since
the
morning
within
beneath
the
flaming
which
burning
in
the
twilight
had
illumined
the
last
supreme
efforts
of
the
sale
everything
looked
like
a
field
of
battle
still
warm
with
the
massacre
of
the
materials
the
salesmen
harassed
and
fatigued
camped
amidst
the
contents
of
their
shelves
and
counters
which
appeared
to
have
been
thrown
into
confusion
by
the
furious
blast
of
a
hurricane
it
was
with
difficulty
that
you
traversed
the
galleries
on
the
ground
floor
obstructed
by
straggling
chairs
in
the
glove
department
it
was
necessary
to
step
over
a
pile
of
cases
heaped
up
around
mignot
through
the
woollens
there
was
no
means
of
passing
at
all
liénard
was
dozing
on
an
ocean
of
bales
in
which
certain
pieces
standing
on
end
though
half
destroyed
seemed
like
houses
which
an
overflowing
river
was
carrying
away
and
further
on
the
linen
department
appeared
like
a
heavy
fall
of
snow
and
you
stumbled
against
icebergs
of
napkins
and
walked
through
flakes
of
handkerchiefs
the
same
disorder
prevailed
upstairs
in
the
departments
of
the
first
floor
the
furs
were
scattered
over
the
flooring
the
mantles
were
heaped
up
like
the
of
soldiers
the
laces
and
the
unfolded
crumpled
thrown
about
everywhere
made
you
think
of
a
nation
of
women
who
had
disrobed
themselves
there
whilst
down
below
in
the
depths
of
the
establishment
the
delivery
department
now
in
full
activity
was
still
and
ever
disgorging
the
parcels
which
filled
it
to
suffocation
and
which
were
carried
off
by
the
vans
in
a
last
effort
of
the
overheated
machine
but
it
was
on
the
silk
department
especially
that
the
customers
had
flung
themselves
with
the
greatest
ardour
there
they
had
cleared
off
everything
there
was
abundant
room
to
pass
the
hall
was
bare
the
whole
of
the
colossal
stock
of
paris
delight
had
been
cut
up
and
carried
away
as
if
by
a
swarm
of
devouring
locusts
and
in
the
midst
of
this
great
void
hutin
and
favier
were
running
through
the
counterfoils
of
their
calculating
their
commission
and
still
short
of
breath
from
the
struggle
favier
it
turned
out
had
made
fifteen
francs
while
hutin
had
only
managed
to
make
thirteen
he
had
been
thoroughly
beaten
that
day
and
was
enraged
at
his
bad
luck
the
eyes
of
both
sparkled
with
the
passion
for
gain
and
all
around
them
other
shopmen
were
likewise
adding
up
figures
glowing
with
the
same
fever
in
the
brutal
gaiety
which
follows
victorious
carnage
well
bourdoncle
cried
out
mouret
are
you
trembling
still
he
had
returned
to
his
favourite
position
against
the
balustrade
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
in
presence
of
the
massacre
of
stuffs
spread
out
below
him
he
indulged
in
a
victorious
laugh
his
fears
of
the
morning
that
moment
of
unpardonable
weakness
which
nobody
would
ever
know
of
inspired
him
with
a
greater
desire
to
triumph
the
battle
was
definitely
won
the
small
tradespeople
of
the
neighbourhood
were
done
for
and
baron
hartmann
was
conquered
with
his
millions
and
his
building
sites
whilst
mouret
gazed
at
the
cashiers
bending
over
their
ledgers
adding
up
long
columns
of
figures
whilst
he
listened
to
the
sound
of
the
gold
falling
from
their
fingers
into
the
metal
bowls
he
already
beheld
the
ladies
paradise
growing
and
growing
enlarging
its
hall
and
prolonging
its
galleries
as
far
as
the
rue
du
and
now
he
resumed
are
you
not
convinced
bourdoncle
that
the
house
is
really
too
small
we
could
have
sold
twice
as
much
bourdoncle
humbled
himself
enraptured
moreover
to
find
himself
in
the
wrong
but
another
spectacle
rendered
them
grave
as
was
the
custom
every
evening
lhomme
the
chief
sales
cashier
had
just
collected
the
receipts
from
each
and
after
adding
them
up
he
wrote
the
total
amount
on
a
paper
which
he
displayed
by
hanging
it
on
the
iron
claw
with
which
the
stump
of
his
mutilated
arm
severed
at
the
elbow
was
provided
and
then
he
took
the
receipts
up
to
the
chief
cash
office
some
in
a
leather
case
and
some
in
bags
according
to
the
nature
of
the
specie
on
this
occasion
the
gold
and
silver
predominated
and
he
slowly
walked
upstairs
carrying
three
enormous
bags
which
he
clasped
with
his
one
arm
against
his
breast
holding
one
of
them
with
his
chin
in
order
to
prevent
it
from
slipping
his
heavy
breathing
could
be
heard
at
a
distance
as
he
passed
along
staggering
and
superb
amidst
the
respectful
shopmen
how
much
lhomme
asked
mouret
eighty
thousand
seven
hundred
and
francs
ten
centimes
replied
the
cashier
a
joyous
laugh
stirred
up
the
ladies
paradise
the
amount
ran
through
the
establishment
it
was
the
highest
figure
ever
attained
in
one
sales
by
a
draper
shop
that
evening
when
denise
went
up
to
bed
she
felt
so
faint
that
she
was
obliged
to
lean
against
the
partition
in
the
corridor
under
the
zinc
roof
and
when
she
was
inside
her
room
with
the
door
closed
she
fell
down
on
the
bed
her
feet
pained
her
so
much
for
a
long
time
she
continued
gazing
with
a
stupid
air
at
the
the
wardrobe
all
the
bareness
this
then
was
where
she
was
going
to
live
and
her
first
day
an
abominable
endless
day
filled
her
with
sore
distress
she
would
never
have
the
courage
to
go
through
such
another
then
she
perceived
that
she
was
dressed
in
silk
and
this
uniform
depressed
her
she
was
childish
enough
before
unpacking
her
box
to
put
on
her
old
woollen
gown
which
hung
over
the
back
of
a
chair
but
when
she
had
once
more
donned
this
poor
garment
a
painful
emotion
choked
her
the
sobs
which
she
had
kept
back
all
day
suddenly
found
vent
in
a
flood
of
hot
tears
she
fell
back
on
the
bed
weeping
at
the
thought
of
the
two
children
and
she
wept
on
and
on
without
even
the
strength
to
take
off
her
boots
so
completely
was
she
overcome
with
fatigue
and
grief
chapter
the
next
day
denise
had
scarcely
been
downstairs
half
an
hour
when
madame
aurélie
said
to
her
in
her
sharp
voice
you
are
wanted
at
the
director
office
mademoiselle
the
girl
found
mouret
alone
in
his
spacious
room
hung
with
green
rep
he
had
suddenly
remembered
that
unkempt
girl
as
bourdoncle
called
her
and
he
who
usually
detested
the
part
of
had
thought
of
sending
for
her
and
stirring
her
up
a
bit
if
she
were
still
dressed
in
the
style
of
a
country
wench
on
the
previous
day
despite
his
jocularity
he
had
experienced
a
feeling
of
wounded
pride
on
seeing
the
elegance
of
one
of
his
saleswomen
questioned
in
madame
presence
he
harboured
a
mixed
sentiment
with
regard
to
denise
a
commingling
as
it
were
of
sympathy
and
anger
we
engaged
you
mademoiselle
he
commenced
out
of
regard
for
your
uncle
and
you
must
not
put
us
under
the
sad
necessity
but
all
at
once
he
stopped
on
the
other
side
of
his
table
stood
denise
upright
serious
and
pale
her
silk
gown
was
no
longer
too
big
for
her
but
fitted
tightly
to
her
pretty
figure
displayed
the
pure
lines
of
her
virgin
shoulders
and
if
her
hair
knotted
in
thick
tresses
still
appeared
somewhat
wild
she
had
at
least
tried
to
keep
it
in
order
after
falling
asleep
with
her
clothes
on
her
eyes
red
with
weeping
she
had
on
waking
at
about
four
felt
ashamed
of
her
nervous
sensibility
and
had
immediately
set
about
her
dress
besides
spending
an
hour
before
the
tiny
combing
her
hair
which
she
was
unable
to
reduce
as
much
as
she
would
have
liked
to
ah
thank
heavens
said
mouret
you
look
better
this
morning
but
there
still
that
dreadful
hair
with
these
words
he
rose
from
his
seat
and
stepped
up
to
her
to
try
and
smooth
her
rebellious
tresses
in
the
same
familiar
way
as
madame
aurélie
on
the
previous
day
there
just
tuck
that
in
behind
your
ear
he
said
the
chignon
is
too
high
she
did
not
speak
but
let
him
arrange
her
hair
in
spite
of
her
vow
to
be
strong
and
brave
she
had
reached
the
office
full
of
misgivings
feeling
certain
that
she
had
been
summoned
to
be
informed
of
her
dismissal
and
mouret
evident
kindliness
did
not
reassure
her
she
was
still
afraid
of
him
feeling
whenever
near
him
that
uneasiness
which
she
attributed
to
natural
anxiety
in
the
presence
of
a
powerful
man
on
whom
her
future
depended
and
when
he
saw
her
thus
trembling
under
his
hands
which
were
grazing
her
neck
he
began
to
regret
his
impulse
for
he
feared
above
all
to
lose
his
authority
in
short
mademoiselle
he
resumed
once
more
placing
the
table
between
himself
and
her
try
and
look
to
your
appearance
you
are
no
longer
at
valognes
study
our
parisian
young
ladies
if
your
name
has
sufficed
to
gain
you
admittance
to
our
house
i
at
least
trust
that
you
will
seek
to
justify
the
good
opinion
i
formed
of
you
from
your
appearance
unfortunately
everybody
here
is
not
of
the
same
opinion
as
myself
let
this
be
a
warning
to
you
do
make
me
tell
a
falsehood
he
treated
her
like
a
child
with
more
pity
than
kindness
his
curiosity
simply
awakened
by
the
troublous
womanly
charm
which
he
divined
was
springing
up
in
this
poor
awkward
girl
and
she
whilst
he
was
lecturing
her
having
suddenly
perceived
the
portrait
of
madame
hédouin
whose
handsome
regular
face
was
smiling
gravely
in
its
gold
frame
felt
herself
shivering
again
despite
the
encouraging
words
he
addressed
to
her
that
was
the
dead
lady
she
whom
people
accused
him
of
having
killed
in
order
to
found
the
house
with
the
blood
of
her
limbs
mouret
was
still
speaking
now
you
may
go
he
said
at
last
sitting
down
and
taking
up
his
pen
and
thereupon
she
went
off
heaving
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
from
that
day
onward
denise
put
forth
all
her
courage
beneath
her
attacks
of
sensitiveness
a
strong
sense
of
reason
was
constantly
working
quite
a
feeling
of
bravery
at
finding
herself
weak
and
alone
with
a
cheerful
determination
to
carry
out
her
task
she
made
very
little
stir
but
went
straight
ahead
to
her
goal
overcoming
all
obstacles
and
that
simply
and
naturally
for
her
nature
was
one
of
unconquerable
sweetness
at
first
she
had
to
surmount
the
terrible
fatigues
of
her
work
in
the
department
the
piles
of
garments
strained
her
arms
to
such
a
degree
that
during
the
first
six
weeks
she
cried
with
pain
when
she
turned
over
at
night
her
back
aching
and
her
shoulders
bruised
but
she
suffered
still
more
from
her
shoes
heavy
shoes
which
she
had
brought
from
valognes
lack
of
money
preventing
her
from
replacing
them
by
light
boots
always
on
her
legs
trotting
about
from
morning
to
night
scolded
if
she
were
seen
leaning
for
a
moment
against
a
partition
her
feet
small
like
those
of
a
child
became
swollen
by
prolonged
imprisonment
in
those
torturing
bluchers
the
heels
throbbed
with
fever
and
the
soles
were
covered
with
blisters
the
skin
of
which
chafed
off
and
stuck
to
her
stockings
she
experienced
too
a
shattering
of
her
whole
frame
the
constant
weariness
of
her
legs
painfully
affected
her
system
and
her
face
was
ever
pale
and
yet
she
so
spare
and
frail
resisted
courageously
whilst
a
great
many
other
saleswomen
attacked
by
special
maladies
were
obliged
to
quit
the
business
her
readiness
to
suffer
her
valiant
stubbornness
sustained
her
smiling
and
upright
however
even
when
she
felt
ready
to
give
way
thoroughly
worn
out
by
labour
to
which
many
men
would
have
succumbed
another
torment
was
to
have
the
whole
department
against
her
to
physical
martyrdom
was
added
the
secret
persecutions
of
her
comrades
two
months
of
patience
and
gentleness
had
not
disarmed
them
she
was
constantly
exposed
to
offensive
remarks
cruel
inventions
a
series
of
slights
which
cut
her
to
the
heart
in
her
longing
for
affection
for
a
long
time
the
others
joked
over
her
unfortunate
first
appearance
and
such
nicknames
as
clogs
and
numbskull
were
bestowed
on
her
then
those
who
missed
a
sale
were
advised
to
go
to
valognes
in
short
she
passed
for
the
fool
of
the
place
and
afterwards
when
she
revealed
herself
to
be
a
remarkably
clever
saleswoman
well
up
in
the
mechanism
of
the
house
the
others
conspired
to
deprive
her
of
all
good
customers
marguerite
and
clara
pursued
her
with
instinctive
hatred
allying
themselves
together
in
order
that
they
might
not
be
swallowed
up
by
this
whom
they
really
feared
in
spite
of
their
affected
disdain
as
for
madame
aurélie
she
was
hurt
by
the
proud
reserve
displayed
by
denise
who
did
not
hover
round
her
skirts
with
an
air
of
caressing
admiration
and
she
therefore
abandoned
her
to
the
rancour
of
her
favourites
the
preferred
ones
of
her
court
who
were
always
on
their
knees
feeding
her
with
the
continual
flattery
which
could
alone
impart
any
amiability
to
her
proud
domineering
nature
for
a
while
the
madame
frédéric
appeared
not
to
enter
into
the
conspiracy
but
this
must
have
been
by
inadvertence
for
she
showed
herself
equally
harsh
directly
she
saw
to
what
annoyances
her
was
likely
to
expose
her
then
the
abandonment
became
complete
they
all
made
a
butt
of
the
unkempt
girl
who
lived
on
in
an
hourly
struggle
only
managing
by
dint
of
the
greatest
courage
to
hold
her
own
in
the
department
such
then
was
her
life
now
she
had
to
smile
look
brave
and
gracious
in
a
silk
gown
which
did
not
belong
to
her
and
she
was
ever
suffering
from
fatigue
badly
treated
under
the
continual
menace
of
a
brutal
dismissal
her
room
was
her
only
refuge
the
only
spot
where
she
could
indulge
in
the
luxury
of
a
cry
when
she
had
suffered
too
much
during
the
day
but
a
terrible
coldness
fell
from
the
zinc
roof
now
covered
with
the
december
snow
she
was
obliged
to
nestle
in
her
iron
bedstead
pile
all
her
clothes
over
her
and
weep
under
the
counterpane
to
prevent
the
frost
from
chapping
her
face
mouret
never
spoke
to
her
now
when
she
noticed
bourdoncle
severe
looks
during
business
hours
she
trembled
for
she
divined
in
him
a
born
enemy
who
would
not
forgive
her
the
slightest
fault
and
amidst
this
general
hostility
inspector
jouve
strange
friendliness
astonished
her
if
he
met
her
in
any
corner
he
smiled
at
her
and
made
some
amiable
remark
twice
too
he
had
saved
her
from
being
reprimanded
without
any
show
of
gratitude
on
her
part
for
she
was
more
troubled
than
touched
by
his
protecting
airs
one
evening
after
dinner
while
the
young
ladies
were
setting
the
cupboards
in
order
joseph
came
to
inform
denise
that
a
young
man
wanted
her
below
she
went
down
feeling
very
anxious
hallo
said
clara
the
girl
has
got
a
follower
then
he
must
be
hard
up
for
a
sweetheart
declared
marguerite
meantime
downstairs
at
the
door
denise
found
her
brother
jean
she
had
formally
prohibited
him
from
coming
to
the
shop
in
this
way
as
it
looked
so
bad
but
she
did
not
dare
to
scold
him
so
excited
did
he
appear
bareheaded
out
of
breath
through
running
all
the
way
from
the
faubourg
du
temple
have
you
got
ten
francs
he
stammered
give
me
ten
francs
or
i
a
lost
man
with
his
flowing
locks
and
handsome
girlish
face
the
young
rascal
looked
so
comical
whilst
launching
out
this
melodramatic
phrase
that
she
could
have
smiled
had
it
not
been
for
the
anguish
which
his
application
for
money
caused
her
what
ten
francs
she
murmured
whatever
the
matter
thereupon
he
blushed
and
explained
that
he
had
met
a
friend
sister
denise
stopped
him
feeling
embarrassed
and
not
wishing
to
know
any
more
about
it
twice
already
had
he
rushed
in
to
obtain
similar
loans
but
on
the
first
occasion
it
had
only
been
a
matter
of
sous
and
on
the
next
of
thirty
he
was
however
always
getting
into
bad
company
i
ca
give
you
ten
francs
she
resumed
pépé
board
is
paid
yet
and
i
only
just
the
money
for
it
i
shall
have
hardly
enough
to
buy
a
pair
of
boots
which
i
want
very
badly
you
are
really
not
reasonable
jean
it
too
bad
of
you
well
i
lost
he
repeated
with
a
tragical
gesture
just
listen
little
sister
she
a
tall
dark
girl
we
went
to
the
café
with
her
brother
i
never
thought
the
drinks
would
she
had
to
interrupt
him
again
and
as
tears
were
coming
into
his
eyes
she
took
out
her
purse
and
slipped
a
piece
into
his
hand
he
at
once
set
up
a
laugh
i
was
sure
of
it
but
on
my
honour
never
again
a
fellow
would
have
to
be
a
regular
scamp
and
thereupon
he
ran
off
after
kissing
his
sister
like
a
madman
the
assistants
in
the
shop
seemed
quite
astonished
that
night
denise
did
not
sleep
much
since
her
entry
into
the
ladies
paradise
money
had
been
her
cruel
anxiety
she
was
still
a
probationer
without
a
salary
the
other
girls
in
her
department
frequently
prevented
her
from
selling
and
she
only
just
managed
to
pay
pépé
board
and
lodging
thanks
to
the
unimportant
customers
they
were
good
enough
to
leave
her
it
was
a
time
of
black
misery
misery
in
a
silk
dress
she
was
often
obliged
to
spend
the
night
in
repairing
her
small
stock
of
clothes
darning
her
linen
mending
her
chemises
as
if
they
had
been
lace
without
mentioning
the
patches
that
she
put
on
her
shoes
as
cleverly
as
any
bootmaker
could
have
done
she
even
risked
washing
things
in
her
hand
basin
but
her
old
woollen
dress
was
an
especial
source
of
anxiety
to
her
she
had
no
other
and
was
forced
to
put
it
on
every
evening
when
she
quitted
the
uniform
silk
and
this
wore
it
terribly
a
stain
on
it
gave
her
quite
a
fever
the
least
rent
was
a
catastrophe
and
she
had
nothing
not
a
sou
not
even
enough
to
buy
the
trifling
articles
which
a
woman
always
wants
she
had
even
been
obliged
to
wait
a
fortnight
to
renew
her
stock
of
needles
and
cotton
thus
it
was
a
real
disaster
when
jean
with
his
love
affairs
suddenly
swooped
down
and
pillaged
her
purse
a
taken
out
of
it
left
an
abyss
which
she
did
not
know
how
to
fill
up
as
for
finding
ten
francs
on
the
morrow
it
was
not
to
be
thought
of
for
a
moment
all
that
night
she
was
haunted
by
nightmare
in
which
she
saw
pépé
thrown
into
the
street
whilst
she
turned
the
paving
stones
over
with
her
bruised
fingers
to
see
if
there
might
not
be
some
money
underneath
them
it
happened
that
the
next
day
she
had
to
play
the
part
of
the
girl
some
customers
came
in
and
madame
aurélie
summoned
her
several
times
in
order
that
she
might
show
off
the
new
styles
and
whilst
she
was
posing
there
with
the
stereotyped
graces
of
a
she
thought
all
the
time
of
pépé
board
and
lodging
which
she
had
promised
to
pay
that
evening
she
would
contrive
to
do
without
any
boots
for
another
month
but
even
on
adding
the
thirty
francs
left
her
of
pépé
money
to
the
four
francs
which
she
had
saved
up
sou
by
sou
there
would
never
be
more
than
francs
and
where
was
she
to
find
six
francs
to
complete
the
sum
she
required
it
was
an
anguish
in
which
her
heart
failed
her
you
will
notice
that
the
shoulders
are
quite
free
madame
aurélie
was
saying
it
very
fashionable
and
very
convenient
the
young
person
can
fold
her
arms
oh
easily
replied
denise
who
continued
to
smile
amiably
one
ca
feel
it
i
am
sure
you
will
like
it
madame
she
was
now
blaming
herself
for
having
gone
to
fetch
pépé
from
madame
gras
on
the
previous
sunday
to
take
him
for
a
walk
in
the
the
poor
child
so
seldom
went
out
with
her
but
she
had
been
obliged
to
buy
him
some
gingerbread
and
a
little
spade
and
then
take
him
to
see
punch
and
judy
and
all
that
had
cost
sous
really
jean
could
not
think
much
about
the
little
one
or
he
would
not
be
so
foolish
everything
fell
upon
her
shoulders
of
course
if
it
does
not
suit
you
madame
resumed
the
just
put
this
other
cloak
on
mademoiselle
so
that
the
lady
may
judge
and
denise
then
walked
slowly
round
wearing
the
cloak
and
saying
this
is
warmer
it
this
year
fashion
and
beneath
her
professional
graces
she
continued
worrying
and
worrying
until
the
evening
at
a
loss
as
to
where
she
might
find
this
money
the
young
ladies
who
were
very
busy
left
her
an
important
sale
but
it
was
only
tuesday
and
she
must
wait
four
days
before
drawing
any
cash
after
dinner
she
decided
to
postpone
her
visit
to
madame
gras
till
the
morrow
she
would
excuse
herself
say
she
had
been
detained
and
before
then
she
would
perhaps
have
obtained
the
six
francs
as
denise
avoided
the
slightest
expense
she
went
to
bed
early
what
could
she
do
penniless
and
wild
and
still
frightened
by
the
big
city
in
which
she
only
knew
the
streets
around
the
shop
after
venturing
as
far
as
the
for
the
sake
of
a
little
fresh
air
she
would
quickly
return
lock
herself
in
her
room
and
set
about
sewing
or
washing
along
the
corridor
conducting
to
the
reigned
a
promiscuity
the
girls
who
were
often
not
very
tidy
would
gossip
there
over
dirty
water
and
dirty
linen
break
into
frequent
quarrels
and
patch
up
continual
reconciliations
they
were
prohibited
from
going
up
to
their
rooms
in
the
they
did
not
live
there
but
merely
slept
there
at
night
climbing
the
stairs
only
at
the
last
minute
and
coming
down
again
in
the
morning
when
still
half
asleep
hardly
awakened
by
a
rapid
wash
and
this
which
night
and
morning
swept
through
the
corridor
the
fatigue
of
thirteen
work
which
threw
them
all
on
their
beds
thoroughly
worn
out
made
the
upper
part
of
the
house
like
an
inn
traversed
by
tired
and
illtempered
travellers
denise
had
no
friend
of
all
the
young
ladies
one
alone
pauline
cugnot
showed
her
a
little
affection
and
the
mantle
and
departments
being
close
to
one
another
and
in
open
war
the
sympathy
between
the
two
saleswomen
had
hitherto
been
confined
to
a
few
rare
words
hastily
exchanged
pauline
certainly
occupied
a
neighbouring
room
to
the
right
of
denise
but
as
she
disappeared
immediately
after
dinner
and
only
returned
at
eleven
the
latter
simply
heard
her
get
into
bed
and
never
met
her
after
business
hours
that
evening
denise
had
made
up
her
mind
to
play
the
part
of
bootmaker
once
more
she
was
holding
her
shoes
turning
them
about
and
wondering
how
she
could
make
them
last
another
month
at
last
she
decided
to
take
a
strong
needle
and
sew
on
the
soles
which
were
threatening
to
leave
the
uppers
meantime
a
collar
and
a
pair
of
cuffs
were
soaking
in
a
basinful
of
soapsuds
every
evening
she
heard
the
same
sounds
the
girls
coming
up
one
by
one
brief
whispered
conversations
bursts
of
laughter
and
sometimes
disputes
which
they
stifled
as
much
as
possible
then
the
beds
creaked
the
tired
occupants
yawned
and
fell
into
heavy
slumber
denise
left
hand
neighbour
often
talked
in
her
sleep
which
at
first
frightened
her
very
much
perhaps
others
like
herself
stopped
up
to
mend
their
things
in
spite
of
the
regulations
but
if
so
they
probably
took
the
same
precautions
as
she
did
moving
with
prudent
care
and
avoiding
the
least
noise
for
a
quivering
silence
prevailed
behind
the
closed
doors
it
had
struck
eleven
some
ten
minutes
previously
when
a
sound
of
footsteps
made
denise
raise
her
head
another
young
lady
late
thought
she
and
she
realised
that
it
was
pauline
by
hearing
the
door
next
to
her
own
open
but
she
was
astonished
when
pauline
quietly
came
back
into
the
passage
and
knocked
at
her
door
make
haste
it
me
the
saleswomen
were
forbidden
to
visit
each
other
in
their
rooms
and
denise
quickly
unlocked
her
door
in
order
that
her
neighbour
might
not
be
caught
by
madame
cabin
who
was
supposed
to
see
this
regulation
strictly
carried
out
was
she
there
asked
denise
when
the
other
had
entered
who
madame
cabin
replied
pauline
oh
i
not
afraid
of
her
she
easily
settled
with
a
piece
and
then
she
added
i
wanted
to
have
a
talk
with
you
for
a
long
time
past
but
impossible
to
do
so
downstairs
besides
you
looked
so
at
table
denise
thanked
her
and
touched
by
her
air
invited
her
to
sit
down
but
in
the
bewilderment
caused
by
this
unexpected
visit
she
had
not
laid
down
the
shoe
she
was
mending
and
pauline
at
once
perceived
it
she
shook
her
head
looked
round
and
espied
the
collar
and
cuffs
in
the
basin
my
poor
child
i
thought
as
much
resumed
she
ah
i
know
what
it
is
when
i
first
came
up
from
chartres
and
old
cugnot
did
send
me
a
sou
i
many
a
time
washed
my
own
chemises
yes
yes
my
chemises
i
had
only
two
and
there
was
always
one
in
soak
she
sat
down
still
out
of
breath
from
running
her
broad
face
with
small
bright
eyes
and
big
tender
mouth
possessed
a
certain
grace
notwithstanding
its
rather
coarse
features
and
without
any
transition
all
of
a
sudden
she
began
to
relate
her
story
her
childhood
at
the
mill
old
cugnot
ruined
by
a
she
sent
to
paris
to
make
her
fortune
with
twenty
francs
in
her
pocket
then
her
start
as
a
saleswoman
in
a
shop
at
batignolles
then
at
the
paradise
a
terrible
start
every
suffering
and
privation
imaginable
and
at
last
her
present
life
the
two
hundred
francs
she
earned
each
month
the
pleasures
she
indulged
in
the
carelessness
in
which
she
allowed
her
days
to
glide
away
some
jewellery
a
brooch
and
glistened
on
her
gown
of
cloth
and
she
smiled
from
under
a
velvet
toque
ornamented
with
a
large
grey
feather
denise
had
turned
very
red
worried
with
reference
to
her
shoe
and
began
to
stammer
out
an
explanation
but
the
same
thing
happened
to
me
repeated
pauline
come
come
older
than
you
i
over
though
i
do
look
it
just
tell
me
your
little
troubles
thereupon
denise
yielded
to
this
friendship
so
frankly
offered
she
sat
down
in
her
petticoat
with
an
old
shawl
over
her
shoulders
near
pauline
in
full
dress
and
an
interesting
gossip
ensued
it
was
freezing
in
the
room
the
cold
seemed
to
run
down
the
bare
walls
but
they
were
so
fully
taken
up
by
their
conversation
that
they
did
not
notice
that
their
fingers
were
almost
little
by
little
denise
opened
her
heart
entirely
spoke
of
jean
and
pépé
and
of
how
grievously
the
money
question
tortured
her
which
led
them
both
to
abuse
the
young
ladies
in
the
mantle
department
pauline
relieved
her
mind
oh
the
hussies
said
she
if
they
treated
you
in
a
proper
way
you
might
make
more
than
a
hundred
francs
a
month
everybody
is
down
on
me
and
i
sure
i
do
know
why
answered
denise
beginning
to
cry
look
at
monsieur
bourdoncle
he
always
watching
me
trying
to
find
me
in
fault
just
as
if
i
were
in
his
way
old
jouve
is
about
the
only
one
the
other
interrupted
her
what
that
old
ape
of
an
inspector
ah
my
dear
do
you
trust
him
he
may
display
his
decoration
as
much
as
he
likes
but
there
a
story
about
something
that
happened
to
him
in
our
department
but
what
a
child
you
are
to
grieve
like
this
what
a
misfortune
it
is
to
be
so
sensitive
of
course
what
is
happening
to
you
happens
to
every
one
they
are
making
you
pay
your
footing
then
carried
away
by
her
good
heart
she
caught
hold
of
denise
hands
and
kissed
her
the
was
a
graver
one
certainly
a
poor
girl
could
not
support
her
two
brothers
pay
the
little
one
board
and
lodging
and
stand
treat
for
the
big
one
sweethearts
with
the
few
paltry
sous
she
picked
up
from
the
others
customers
for
it
was
to
be
feared
that
she
would
not
get
any
salary
until
business
improved
in
march
listen
to
me
it
impossible
for
you
to
live
in
this
way
any
longer
if
i
were
you
said
pauline
but
a
noise
in
the
corridor
stopped
her
it
was
probably
marguerite
who
was
accused
of
prowling
about
at
night
to
spy
upon
the
others
pauline
who
was
still
pressing
her
friend
hand
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
in
silence
listening
then
with
an
air
of
affectionate
conviction
she
began
to
whisper
to
her
denise
did
not
understand
at
first
and
when
she
did
she
withdrew
her
hands
looking
very
confused
by
what
her
friend
had
told
her
oh
no
she
replied
simply
then
continued
pauline
you
never
manage
i
tell
you
so
plainly
here
are
the
figures
forty
francs
for
the
little
one
a
piece
now
and
again
for
the
big
one
and
then
yourself
you
ca
always
go
about
dressed
like
a
pauper
with
shoes
that
make
the
other
girls
laugh
at
you
yes
really
your
shoes
do
you
a
deal
of
harm
it
would
be
much
better
to
do
as
i
tell
you
no
no
repeated
denise
well
you
are
very
foolish
it
inevitable
my
dear
we
all
come
to
it
sooner
or
later
look
at
me
i
was
a
probationer
like
you
without
a
sou
we
are
boarded
and
lodged
it
true
but
there
our
dress
besides
it
impossible
to
go
without
a
copper
in
one
pocket
and
shut
oneself
up
in
one
room
watching
the
flies
so
you
see
girls
forcibly
drift
into
it
she
then
spoke
of
her
first
admirer
a
lawyer
clerk
whom
she
had
met
at
a
party
at
meudon
after
him
had
come
a
clerk
and
finally
ever
since
the
autumn
she
had
been
keeping
company
with
a
salesman
at
the
bon
marché
a
very
nice
tall
fellow
however
her
advice
had
no
effect
whatever
upon
denise
no
the
latter
replied
in
a
tone
of
decision
and
a
fresh
silence
fell
in
the
small
cold
room
they
were
smiling
at
each
other
greatly
affected
by
this
whispered
conversation
besides
one
must
have
affection
for
some
one
she
resumed
her
cheeks
quite
scarlet
pauline
was
astonished
she
set
up
a
laugh
and
embraced
her
a
second
time
exclaiming
but
my
darling
when
you
meet
and
like
each
other
you
are
really
droll
look
here
would
you
like
baugé
to
take
us
somewhere
in
the
country
on
sunday
he
bring
one
of
his
friends
no
again
said
denise
in
her
gently
obstinate
way
then
pauline
insisted
no
further
each
was
free
to
act
as
she
pleased
what
she
had
said
was
out
of
pure
kindness
of
heart
for
she
felt
really
grieved
to
see
a
comrade
so
miserable
and
as
it
was
nearly
midnight
she
got
up
to
leave
but
before
doing
so
she
forced
denise
to
accept
the
six
francs
she
wanted
to
make
up
pépé
begging
her
not
to
trouble
about
the
matter
but
to
repay
her
the
amount
whenever
she
earned
more
now
she
added
blow
your
candle
out
so
that
they
may
not
see
which
door
opens
you
can
light
it
again
immediately
afterwards
the
candle
having
been
extinguished
they
shook
hands
and
then
pauline
ran
off
to
her
room
giving
no
sign
of
her
passage
through
the
darkness
save
the
vague
rustling
of
her
petticoats
amidst
the
deep
slumber
that
had
fallen
on
the
occupants
of
the
other
little
rooms
before
going
to
bed
denise
wished
to
finish
her
boot
and
do
her
washing
the
cold
became
sharper
still
as
the
night
advanced
but
she
did
not
feel
it
the
conversation
had
stirred
her
heart
blood
she
was
not
shocked
it
seemed
to
her
that
every
woman
had
a
right
to
arrange
her
life
as
she
liked
when
she
was
alone
and
free
in
the
world
for
her
own
part
however
she
had
never
given
way
to
such
ideas
her
sense
of
right
and
her
healthy
nature
naturally
maintained
her
in
the
respectability
in
which
she
had
always
lived
at
last
towards
one
she
went
to
bed
no
she
thought
she
did
not
love
any
one
so
what
was
the
use
of
upsetting
her
life
the
maternal
devotion
which
she
had
vowed
for
her
two
brothers
however
she
did
not
sleep
insomnia
gained
upon
her
and
a
crowd
of
indistinct
forms
flitted
before
her
closed
eyes
then
vanished
in
the
darkness
from
that
time
forward
denise
took
an
interest
in
the
of
the
department
during
slack
times
the
girls
were
constantly
occupied
with
their
amatory
affairs
gossiping
tales
flew
about
stories
of
adventures
which
amused
them
all
for
a
week
clara
was
a
scandal
and
merely
remained
at
the
shop
under
pretence
of
leading
a
respectable
life
in
order
to
shield
herself
from
her
family
for
she
was
mortally
afraid
of
old
prunaire
who
had
threatened
to
come
to
paris
and
break
her
arms
and
legs
with
his
clogs
marguerite
on
the
contrary
behaved
very
well
and
was
not
known
to
have
any
lover
which
caused
some
surprise
for
all
knew
of
the
circumstances
which
had
led
to
her
arrival
in
paris
the
young
women
also
joked
about
madame
frédéric
declaring
that
she
was
discreetly
connected
with
certain
great
personages
but
the
truth
was
they
knew
nothing
of
her
for
she
disappeared
every
evening
stiff
as
starch
with
her
sulkiness
and
apparently
always
in
a
great
hurry
though
nobody
knew
whither
she
hastened
so
eagerly
as
for
the
about
madame
aurélie
this
was
certainly
false
mere
invention
spread
abroad
by
discontented
saleswomen
just
for
fun
perhaps
she
had
formerly
displayed
rather
more
than
a
motherly
feeling
for
one
of
her
friends
but
she
now
occupied
too
high
a
position
in
the
business
to
indulge
in
such
childishness
then
there
was
the
flock
the
crowd
of
the
girls
going
off
in
the
evening
nine
out
of
every
ten
having
young
men
waiting
for
them
at
the
door
on
the
place
gaillon
along
the
rue
de
la
michodière
and
the
rue
there
was
always
a
troop
of
motionless
sentries
watching
for
the
girls
departure
and
when
the
began
each
gave
his
arm
to
his
lady
and
walked
away
it
was
like
the
exit
of
some
theatre
where
figurantes
predominate
what
most
troubled
denise
however
was
that
she
had
discovered
colomban
secret
he
was
continually
to
be
seen
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
on
the
threshold
of
the
old
elbeuf
his
eyes
raised
and
never
quitting
the
young
ladies
of
the
jacket
and
mantle
department
when
he
espied
denise
watching
him
he
blushed
and
turned
away
his
head
as
if
afraid
that
she
might
betray
him
to
geneviève
although
there
had
been
no
further
connection
between
the
baudus
and
their
niece
since
her
engagement
at
the
ladies
paradise
at
first
on
seeing
his
despairing
airs
she
had
fancied
that
he
was
in
love
with
marguerite
for
marguerite
being
very
and
sleeping
in
the
house
was
not
easy
to
approach
but
great
was
her
astonishment
to
find
that
colomban
ardent
glances
were
intended
for
clara
for
months
past
he
had
been
devoured
by
passion
in
this
way
remaining
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
and
lacking
the
courage
to
declare
himself
and
this
for
a
girl
who
was
perfectly
free
who
lived
in
the
rue
and
whom
he
could
have
spoken
to
any
evening
clara
herself
appeared
to
have
no
idea
of
her
conquest
denise
discovery
filled
her
with
painful
emotion
was
love
so
idiotic
then
what
this
fellow
who
had
real
happiness
within
his
reach
was
ruining
his
life
for
the
sake
of
that
girl
whom
he
adored
as
reverently
as
if
she
had
been
a
saint
from
that
day
forward
she
felt
a
heart
pang
each
time
she
espied
geneviève
pale
suffering
face
behind
the
greeny
panes
of
the
old
elbeuf
in
the
evening
denise
could
not
help
thinking
a
great
deal
on
seeing
the
young
ladies
march
off
with
their
sweethearts
she
was
sometimes
obliged
to
reply
by
a
smile
to
a
friendly
nod
from
pauline
for
whom
baugé
waited
regularly
every
evening
at
eight
beside
the
fountain
on
the
place
gaillon
then
after
going
out
the
last
and
taking
a
furtive
walk
always
alone
she
was
invariably
the
first
to
return
going
upstairs
to
work
or
to
sleep
her
head
full
of
dreams
inquisitive
as
to
the
outdoor
life
of
the
others
of
which
she
knew
nothing
she
certainly
did
not
envy
them
she
was
happy
in
her
solitude
in
the
unsociableness
in
which
she
shut
herself
up
as
in
a
but
all
the
same
her
imagination
carried
her
away
she
would
try
to
guess
things
picture
the
pleasures
constantly
described
before
her
the
cafés
the
restaurants
the
theatres
the
sundays
spent
on
the
river
and
in
the
country
taverns
quite
a
weariness
of
mind
a
desire
mingled
with
lassitude
resulted
from
these
imaginings
and
she
seemed
to
have
already
had
her
fill
of
amusements
which
she
had
never
tasted
however
there
was
but
little
room
for
dangerous
dreams
in
her
daily
working
life
during
the
thirteen
hours
of
hard
toil
in
the
shop
there
was
no
time
for
any
display
of
affection
between
the
salesmen
and
the
saleswomen
if
the
continual
fight
for
money
had
not
abolished
all
sexual
difference
the
unceasing
press
of
business
which
occupied
their
minds
and
fatigued
their
bodies
would
have
sufficed
to
stifle
desire
but
very
few
had
been
known
in
the
establishment
amidst
the
various
hostilities
and
friendships
between
the
men
and
the
women
the
constant
elbowing
from
department
to
department
they
were
all
nothing
but
pieces
of
mechanism
forced
to
contribute
of
the
working
of
the
immense
machine
abdicating
all
individuality
and
simply
contributing
their
strength
to
the
total
commonplace
phalansterian
power
it
was
only
outside
the
shop
that
they
resumed
their
individual
lives
with
a
sudden
flaming
of
awakened
passion
denise
however
one
day
saw
albert
lhomme
slip
a
note
into
the
hand
of
a
young
lady
in
the
department
after
several
times
passing
by
with
an
air
of
indifference
the
dead
season
which
lasts
from
december
to
february
was
commencing
and
she
now
had
periods
of
rest
hours
spent
on
her
feet
with
her
eyes
wandering
all
over
the
shop
whilst
waiting
for
customers
the
young
ladies
of
her
department
were
especially
friendly
with
the
salesmen
who
served
the
lace
but
their
intimacy
never
seemed
to
go
any
further
than
whispered
banter
in
the
lace
department
there
was
a
a
gay
young
spark
who
pursued
clara
with
all
sorts
of
suggestive
stories
simply
by
way
of
a
joke
for
he
really
cared
so
little
for
her
that
he
made
no
effort
to
meet
her
out
of
doors
and
thus
it
was
from
counter
to
counter
the
gentlemen
and
the
young
ladies
would
exchange
winks
nods
and
remarks
which
they
alone
understood
at
times
with
their
backs
half
turned
and
a
dreamy
look
on
their
faces
in
order
to
put
the
terrible
bourdoncle
off
the
scent
they
would
indulge
in
some
sly
gossip
as
for
deloche
he
long
contented
himself
with
smiling
at
denise
when
he
met
her
but
getting
bolder
he
at
last
occasionally
murmured
a
friendly
word
on
the
day
she
had
noticed
madame
aurélie
son
giving
a
note
to
the
young
lady
in
the
department
it
precisely
happened
that
deloche
was
asking
her
if
she
had
enjoyed
her
lunch
feeling
a
desire
to
say
something
and
unable
to
think
of
anything
more
amiable
he
also
saw
the
billet
pass
and
as
he
glanced
at
the
young
girl
they
both
blushed
at
thought
of
this
intrigue
carried
on
under
their
eyes
but
despite
all
these
occurrences
which
gradually
awoke
the
woman
in
her
denise
still
retained
her
infantile
peace
of
mind
the
one
thing
that
stirred
her
heart
was
to
meet
hutin
but
even
this
was
only
gratitude
in
her
eyes
she
simply
thought
herself
touched
by
the
young
man
politeness
he
could
not
bring
a
customer
to
the
department
without
making
her
feel
quite
confused
several
times
on
returning
from
a
she
found
herself
making
a
and
traversing
the
silk
hall
though
she
had
no
business
there
her
bosom
heaving
the
while
with
emotion
one
afternoon
she
met
mouret
there
and
he
seemed
to
follow
her
with
a
smile
he
paid
scarcely
any
attention
to
her
now
only
addressing
a
few
words
to
her
from
time
to
time
to
give
her
a
few
hints
about
her
toilet
and
to
joke
with
her
as
an
impossible
girl
a
little
savage
almost
a
boy
whom
he
would
never
manage
to
transform
into
a
coquette
notwithstanding
all
his
knowledge
of
women
sometimes
indeed
he
even
ventured
to
laugh
at
her
and
tease
her
without
caring
to
acknowledge
to
himself
the
troublous
feeling
the
charm
which
this
little
saleswoman
with
such
a
comical
head
of
hair
inspired
in
him
and
that
afternoon
at
sight
of
his
mute
smile
denise
trembled
as
if
she
were
in
fault
did
he
know
why
she
was
crossing
the
silk
department
when
she
could
not
herself
have
explained
what
had
impelled
her
to
make
such
a
hutin
moreover
did
not
seem
to
be
at
all
aware
of
the
young
grateful
looks
the
were
not
his
style
he
affected
to
despise
them
boasting
more
than
ever
of
his
pretended
adventures
with
the
lady
customers
one
day
a
baroness
had
beamed
on
him
he
would
relate
and
on
another
occasion
he
had
fascinated
the
wife
of
an
eminent
architect
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
his
only
conquests
were
among
girls
at
cafés
and
like
all
young
men
in
the
drapery
line
he
had
a
mania
for
spending
battling
throughout
the
week
with
a
miser
greediness
with
the
sole
object
of
squandering
his
money
on
sundays
on
the
or
in
the
restaurants
and
he
never
thought
of
saving
a
penny
but
spent
his
salary
as
soon
as
he
drew
it
absolutely
indifferent
about
the
future
favier
did
not
join
him
in
these
pleasure
parties
hutin
and
he
so
friendly
in
the
shop
bowed
to
each
other
at
the
door
where
all
further
intercourse
between
them
ceased
a
great
many
of
the
shopmen
always
side
by
side
indoors
became
perfect
strangers
ignorant
of
each
other
lives
as
soon
as
they
set
foot
in
the
streets
however
hutin
had
an
intimate
liénard
of
the
woollen
department
both
lived
in
the
same
the
hôtel
de
smyrne
in
the
rue
a
murky
building
entirely
inhabited
by
shop
assistants
in
the
morning
they
arrived
at
the
paradise
together
and
in
the
evening
the
first
who
found
himself
free
after
the
folding
was
done
waited
for
the
other
at
the
café
in
the
rue
a
little
place
where
many
employees
of
the
ladies
paradise
met
brawling
drinking
and
playing
cards
amidst
the
smoke
of
their
pipes
they
often
stopped
there
till
one
in
the
morning
until
indeed
the
tired
landlord
turned
them
out
for
the
last
month
however
they
had
been
spending
three
evenings
a
week
at
a
at
montmartre
whither
they
would
take
their
friends
in
order
to
fan
the
success
of
mademoiselle
laure
a
singer
hutin
latest
conquest
whose
talent
they
applauded
with
such
violent
rapping
of
their
and
such
clamorous
shouts
that
on
two
occasions
the
police
had
been
obliged
to
interfere
the
winter
passed
in
this
way
and
at
last
denise
obtained
a
fixed
salary
of
three
hundred
francs
it
was
quite
time
she
did
so
for
her
shoes
were
completely
worn
out
for
the
last
month
she
had
avoided
going
out
for
fear
of
bursting
them
altogether
what
a
noise
you
make
with
your
shoes
mademoiselle
madame
aurélie
very
often
remarked
with
an
irritated
look
it
intolerable
the
matter
with
your
feet
on
the
day
when
denise
came
down
wearing
a
pair
of
cloth
boots
which
had
cost
her
five
francs
marguerite
and
clara
expressed
their
astonishment
in
a
kind
of
half
whisper
so
as
to
be
heard
hullo
the
unkempt
one
has
given
up
her
goloshes
said
the
former
ah
retorted
the
other
she
must
have
cried
over
them
they
were
her
mother
in
point
of
fact
there
was
a
general
uprising
against
denise
the
girls
of
her
department
had
discovered
her
friendship
with
pauline
and
thought
they
detected
a
certain
bravado
in
this
display
of
affection
for
a
saleswoman
of
a
rival
counter
they
spoke
of
treason
accused
her
of
going
and
repeating
their
slightest
words
to
their
enemies
the
war
between
the
two
departments
became
more
violent
than
ever
it
had
never
waxed
so
warm
angry
words
were
exchanged
like
cannon
shots
and
a
slap
even
was
given
one
evening
behind
some
boxes
of
chemises
possibly
this
quarrel
arose
from
the
fact
that
the
young
ladies
in
the
department
wore
woollen
gowns
whilst
those
of
the
mantles
wore
silk
in
any
case
the
former
spoke
of
their
neighbours
with
the
shocked
air
of
respectable
women
and
facts
proved
that
they
were
right
for
it
had
been
remarked
that
the
silk
dresses
appeared
to
lead
to
dissolute
habits
among
the
young
ladies
who
wore
them
clara
was
taunted
with
her
troop
of
lovers
even
marguerite
had
her
child
thrown
in
her
teeth
as
it
were
whilst
madame
frédéric
was
accused
of
all
sorts
of
secret
passions
and
all
this
solely
on
account
of
denise
now
young
ladies
no
ugly
words
behave
yourselves
madame
aurélie
would
say
with
her
imperial
air
amidst
the
rising
passions
of
her
little
kingdom
show
who
you
are
at
heart
she
preferred
to
remain
neutral
as
she
confessed
one
day
when
talking
to
mouret
these
girls
were
all
about
the
same
one
was
no
better
than
another
but
she
suddenly
became
impassioned
when
she
learnt
from
bourdoncle
that
he
had
just
caught
her
son
downstairs
kissing
a
young
girl
belonging
to
the
department
the
saleswoman
to
whom
he
had
passed
several
letters
it
was
abominable
and
she
roundly
accused
the
department
of
having
laid
a
trap
for
albert
yes
it
was
a
affair
against
herself
they
were
trying
to
dishonour
her
by
ruining
an
inexperienced
boy
after
finding
it
impossible
to
attack
her
department
her
only
object
however
in
making
such
a
noise
was
to
complicate
the
business
for
she
was
well
aware
of
her
son
character
and
knew
him
to
be
capable
of
all
sorts
of
stupid
things
for
a
time
the
matter
threatened
to
assume
a
serious
aspect
mignot
the
glove
salesman
was
mixed
up
in
it
he
was
a
great
friend
of
albert
and
the
rumour
circulated
that
he
favoured
the
girls
whom
albert
sent
him
and
who
rummaged
in
his
boxes
for
hours
together
there
was
also
a
story
about
some
suède
kid
gloves
given
to
the
saleswoman
of
the
department
which
was
never
properly
cleared
up
at
last
the
scandal
was
stifled
out
of
regard
for
madame
aurélie
whom
mouret
himself
treated
with
deference
bourdoncle
contented
himself
a
week
later
with
dismissing
for
some
slight
offence
the
girl
who
had
allowed
herself
to
be
kissed
at
all
events
if
the
managers
closed
their
eyes
to
the
terrible
doings
of
their
employees
out
of
doors
they
did
not
tolerate
the
least
nonsense
in
the
house
and
it
was
denise
who
suffered
for
all
this
madame
aurélie
although
perfectly
well
aware
of
what
was
going
on
nourished
a
secret
rancour
against
her
and
seeing
her
laughing
one
evening
with
pauline
she
also
took
it
for
bravado
concluding
that
they
were
gossiping
over
her
and
she
thereupon
sought
to
increase
the
girl
isolation
in
the
department
for
some
time
she
had
been
thinking
of
inviting
the
young
ladies
to
spend
a
sunday
at
les
rigolles
near
rambouillet
where
she
had
bought
a
country
house
with
the
first
hundred
thousand
francs
she
had
saved
and
she
suddenly
decided
to
do
so
it
would
be
a
means
of
punishing
denise
of
putting
her
openly
on
one
side
she
was
the
only
one
not
invited
for
a
fortnight
in
advance
nothing
was
talked
of
but
this
pleasure
party
the
girls
kept
their
eyes
on
the
sky
already
warmed
by
the
may
sunshine
and
mapped
out
the
whole
day
looking
forward
to
all
sorts
of
pleasures
milk
and
brown
bread
and
they
were
to
be
all
women
which
was
more
amusing
still
as
a
rule
madame
aurélie
killed
her
holidays
like
this
in
going
out
with
lady
friends
for
she
was
so
little
accustomed
to
being
at
home
she
always
felt
so
uncomfortable
so
out
of
her
element
on
the
rare
occasions
when
she
could
dine
with
her
husband
and
son
that
she
preferred
even
not
to
avail
herself
of
the
opportunity
but
to
go
and
dine
at
a
restaurant
lhomme
went
his
own
way
enraptured
to
resume
his
bachelor
existence
and
albert
greatly
relieved
hastened
off
to
his
beauties
so
that
unaccustomed
to
feeling
they
were
in
each
way
bored
to
death
whenever
they
were
together
on
a
sunday
they
paid
nothing
more
than
flying
visits
to
the
house
as
to
some
common
hotel
where
people
take
a
bed
for
the
night
with
respect
to
the
excursion
to
rambouillet
madame
aurélie
simply
declared
that
considerations
of
propriety
would
not
allow
albert
to
join
them
and
that
the
father
himself
would
display
great
tact
by
refusing
to
come
a
declaration
which
enchanted
both
men
however
the
happy
day
was
drawing
near
and
the
girls
chattered
away
more
than
ever
relating
their
preparations
in
the
way
of
dress
just
as
if
they
were
going
on
a
six
months
tour
whilst
denise
had
to
listen
to
them
pale
and
silent
in
her
abandonment
ah
they
make
you
wild
do
they
said
pauline
to
her
one
morning
if
i
were
you
i
would
just
catch
them
nicely
they
are
going
to
enjoy
themselves
i
would
enjoy
myself
too
come
with
us
on
sunday
baugé
is
going
to
take
me
to
joinville
no
thanks
said
the
girl
with
her
quiet
obstinacy
but
why
not
are
you
still
afraid
of
being
made
love
to
and
thereupon
pauline
laughed
heartily
denise
also
smiled
she
knew
how
such
things
came
about
it
was
always
during
some
similar
excursions
that
the
young
ladies
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
their
lovers
come
resumed
pauline
i
assure
you
that
baugé
wo
bring
any
one
we
shall
be
all
by
ourselves
as
you
do
want
me
to
i
wo
go
and
marry
you
off
of
course
denise
hesitated
tormented
by
such
a
strong
desire
to
go
that
the
blood
rushed
to
her
cheeks
since
the
girls
had
been
talking
about
their
country
pleasures
she
had
felt
stifled
overcome
by
a
longing
for
fresh
air
dreaming
of
tall
grass
into
which
she
might
sink
to
the
neck
and
of
giant
trees
whose
shadows
would
flow
over
her
like
so
much
cooling
water
her
childhood
spent
amidst
the
rich
verdure
of
le
cotentin
was
awakening
with
a
regret
for
sun
and
air
well
yes
said
she
at
last
then
everything
was
soon
arranged
baugé
was
to
come
and
fetch
them
at
eight
on
the
place
gaillon
whence
they
would
take
a
cab
to
the
vincennes
station
denise
whose
francs
a
month
was
quickly
exhausted
by
the
children
had
only
been
able
to
do
up
her
old
black
woollen
dress
by
trimming
it
with
some
strips
of
check
poplin
but
she
had
made
herself
a
bonnet
by
covering
a
shape
with
some
silk
and
ornamenting
it
with
blue
ribbon
in
this
quiet
attire
she
looked
very
young
like
an
overgrown
girl
displaying
all
the
cleanliness
of
careful
poverty
and
somewhat
shamefaced
and
embarrassed
by
her
luxuriant
hair
which
waved
round
the
bareness
of
her
bonnet
pauline
on
the
contrary
displayed
a
pretty
spring
costume
in
silk
striped
white
and
violet
a
feathered
bonnet
with
bows
matching
the
dress
and
jewels
about
her
neck
and
rings
on
her
fingers
which
gave
her
the
appearance
of
a
tradesman
wife
it
was
like
a
sunday
revenge
on
the
woollen
gown
which
she
was
obliged
to
wear
throughout
the
week
in
the
shop
whereas
denise
who
wore
her
uniform
silk
from
monday
to
saturday
resumed
on
sundays
her
thin
woollen
dress
of
aspect
there
baugé
said
pauline
pointing
to
a
tall
young
man
standing
near
the
fountain
and
thereupon
she
introduced
her
lover
and
denise
felt
at
her
ease
at
once
he
seemed
such
a
nice
fellow
big
and
strong
as
an
ox
with
a
long
flemish
face
in
which
his
expressionless
eyes
twinkled
with
infantile
puerility
baugé
was
the
younger
son
of
a
grocer
of
dunkerque
and
had
come
to
paris
almost
driven
from
home
by
his
father
and
brother
who
thought
him
a
fearful
dunce
however
he
now
made
three
thousand
five
hundred
francs
a
year
at
the
bon
marché
certainly
in
some
things
he
was
rather
stupid
but
he
proved
a
very
good
hand
in
the
linen
department
and
the
cab
asked
pauline
they
had
to
go
on
foot
as
far
as
the
boulevard
the
sun
was
already
warming
the
streets
and
the
glorious
may
morning
seemed
to
be
smiling
on
the
pavements
there
was
not
a
cloud
in
the
sky
all
was
gay
in
the
blue
air
transparent
as
crystal
an
involuntary
smile
played
about
denise
lips
she
breathed
freely
it
seemed
to
her
that
her
bosom
was
throwing
off
a
stifling
fit
of
six
months
duration
at
last
she
no
longer
felt
the
stuffy
air
and
the
heavy
stones
of
the
ladies
paradise
weighing
her
down
she
had
the
prospect
of
a
long
day
in
the
country
before
her
and
it
was
like
a
new
lease
of
life
an
infinite
delight
into
which
she
entered
with
all
the
glee
of
a
little
child
however
when
they
were
in
the
cab
she
turned
her
eyes
away
feeling
ill
at
ease
as
pauline
bent
over
to
kiss
her
lover
oh
look
said
she
her
head
still
at
the
window
there
monsieur
lhomme
how
he
does
walk
he
got
his
french
horn
added
pauline
leaning
out
what
an
old
fool
he
is
one
would
think
he
was
running
off
to
meet
his
girl
lhomme
with
his
nose
in
the
air
and
his
instrument
under
his
arm
was
spinning
along
past
the
gymnase
theatre
laughing
with
delight
at
the
thought
of
the
treat
in
store
for
him
he
was
about
to
spend
the
day
with
a
friend
a
flautist
at
a
petty
theatre
in
whose
rooms
a
few
amateurs
indulged
in
a
little
on
sundays
as
soon
as
breakfast
was
over
at
eight
what
a
madman
resumed
pauline
and
you
know
that
madame
aurélie
and
her
clique
must
have
taken
the
rambouillet
train
that
left
at
six
it
very
certain
the
husband
and
wife
wo
come
across
each
other
both
then
began
talking
of
the
rambouillet
excursion
they
did
not
wish
it
to
be
rainy
for
the
others
because
they
themselves
might
suffer
as
well
still
if
a
cloud
could
only
burst
over
there
without
a
drop
falling
at
joinville
it
would
be
funny
all
the
same
then
they
attacked
clara
who
hardly
knew
how
to
spend
the
money
she
made
by
her
vices
had
she
bought
three
pairs
of
boots
all
at
the
same
time
and
thrown
them
away
the
next
day
after
slashing
them
with
her
scissors
on
account
of
her
feet
which
were
covered
with
corns
in
fact
the
young
ladies
were
just
as
bad
as
the
young
men
they
squandered
everything
never
saving
a
sou
but
wasting
two
or
three
hundred
francs
a
month
on
dress
and
dainties
but
he
only
got
one
arm
all
of
a
sudden
said
baugé
who
had
kept
his
eyes
on
lhomme
how
does
he
manage
to
play
the
french
horn
pauline
who
sometimes
amused
herself
by
playing
on
her
stupidity
thereupon
told
him
that
the
cashier
kept
the
instrument
up
by
leaning
it
against
a
wall
he
thoroughly
believed
her
and
thought
it
very
ingenious
and
when
stricken
with
remorse
she
explained
to
him
that
lhomme
had
adapted
to
his
stump
a
system
of
claws
which
he
made
use
of
as
fingers
he
shook
his
head
full
of
doubt
and
declaring
that
they
would
make
him
swallow
that
you
are
really
too
stupid
she
retorted
laughing
never
mind
i
love
you
all
the
same
they
reached
the
station
of
the
vincennes
line
just
in
time
for
a
train
baugé
paid
but
denise
had
previously
declared
that
she
wished
to
defray
her
share
of
the
expenses
they
would
settle
up
in
the
evening
they
took
tickets
and
found
the
train
full
of
a
gay
noisy
throng
at
nogent
a
got
out
amidst
a
storm
of
laughter
then
at
last
they
arrived
at
joinville
and
went
straight
to
the
island
to
order
lunch
and
afterwards
lingered
there
strolling
along
under
the
tall
poplars
beside
the
marne
it
was
rather
cold
in
the
shade
a
sharp
breeze
was
blowing
in
the
sunshine
gathering
strength
as
it
swept
from
the
distance
over
a
plain
dotted
with
cultivated
fields
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
denise
lingered
behind
pauline
and
her
lover
who
walked
along
with
their
arms
round
each
other
waists
she
had
picked
a
handful
of
buttercups
and
was
watching
the
flow
of
the
river
happy
but
her
heart
beating
and
her
head
drooping
each
time
that
baugé
leant
over
to
kiss
his
sweetheart
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
yet
she
was
not
suffering
what
could
be
the
matter
with
her
that
she
experienced
this
feeling
of
suffocation
why
did
this
vast
landscape
amidst
which
she
had
looked
forward
to
so
much
enjoyment
fill
her
with
a
vague
regret
that
she
could
not
explain
however
at
lunch
pauline
noisy
laughter
bewildered
her
that
young
woman
who
loved
the
suburbs
with
the
passion
of
an
actress
living
in
the
in
the
heavy
atmosphere
of
a
crowd
wanted
to
lunch
in
an
arbour
notwithstanding
the
sharp
wind
she
made
merry
over
the
sudden
gusts
which
blew
up
the
and
thought
the
arbour
very
funny
in
its
bareness
with
its
which
cast
a
reflection
on
the
cloth
she
ate
ravenously
devouring
everything
with
the
voracity
of
one
who
being
badly
fed
at
the
shop
made
up
for
it
out
of
doors
by
giving
herself
an
indigestion
of
all
the
things
she
liked
this
was
indeed
her
vice
she
spent
most
of
her
money
on
cakes
and
indigestible
dainties
of
all
kinds
which
she
hastily
nibbled
in
leisure
moments
now
however
as
denise
seemed
to
have
had
enough
with
the
eggs
fried
fish
and
stewed
chicken
she
restrained
herself
not
daring
to
order
any
strawberries
which
were
still
very
dear
for
fear
of
running
the
bill
up
too
high
now
what
are
we
going
to
do
asked
baugé
when
the
coffee
was
served
as
a
rule
pauline
and
he
returned
to
paris
to
dine
and
finish
their
outing
in
some
theatre
but
at
denise
request
they
decided
to
remain
at
joinville
all
day
it
would
be
droll
they
would
take
a
fill
of
the
country
so
they
wandered
about
the
fields
all
the
afternoon
they
spoke
for
a
moment
of
going
for
a
row
but
abandoned
the
idea
as
baugé
was
not
a
good
waterman
however
their
strolls
along
the
pathways
ended
by
bringing
them
back
to
the
banks
of
the
marne
all
the
same
and
they
became
interested
in
all
the
river
life
the
squadrons
of
yawls
and
skiffs
and
the
young
men
who
formed
the
crews
the
sun
was
setting
and
they
were
returning
towards
joinville
when
they
saw
two
boats
coming
down
stream
at
a
racing
speed
their
crews
meantime
exchanging
volleys
of
insults
in
which
the
repeated
cries
of
sawbones
and
predominated
hallo
said
pauline
it
monsieur
hutin
yes
replied
baugé
shading
his
face
with
his
hand
i
recognise
his
mahogany
boat
the
other
one
is
manned
by
students
no
doubt
thereupon
he
explained
the
deadly
hatred
existing
between
the
students
and
the
shopmen
denise
on
hearing
hutin
name
mentioned
had
suddenly
stopped
and
with
fixed
eyes
followed
the
frail
skiff
she
tried
to
distinguish
the
young
man
among
the
rowers
but
could
only
manage
to
make
out
the
white
dresses
of
two
women
one
of
whom
who
was
steering
wore
a
red
hat
then
the
voices
of
the
disputants
died
away
amidst
the
loud
flow
of
the
river
pitch
in
the
sawbones
duck
the
in
the
evening
they
returned
to
the
restaurant
on
the
island
but
it
had
turned
very
chilly
and
they
were
obliged
to
dine
in
one
of
the
closed
rooms
where
the
were
still
damp
from
the
humidity
of
winter
at
six
the
tables
were
already
crowded
yet
the
excursionists
still
hurried
in
looking
for
vacant
corners
and
the
waiters
continued
bringing
in
more
chairs
and
forms
putting
the
plates
closer
and
closer
together
and
crowding
the
people
up
cold
as
it
had
been
before
the
atmosphere
now
became
stifling
and
they
had
to
open
the
windows
out
of
doors
the
day
was
waning
a
greenish
twilight
fell
from
the
poplars
so
quickly
that
the
landlord
unprepared
for
these
repasts
under
cover
and
having
no
lamps
was
obliged
to
put
a
candle
on
each
table
what
with
the
laughter
the
calls
and
the
clatter
of
plates
and
dishes
the
uproar
became
deafening
the
candles
flared
and
guttered
in
the
draught
from
the
open
windows
whilst
moths
fluttered
about
in
the
air
warmed
by
the
odour
of
the
food
and
traversed
by
sudden
cold
gusts
of
wind
what
fun
they
having
eh
said
pauline
very
busy
with
a
plate
of
stewed
eels
which
she
declared
extraordinary
and
she
leant
over
to
add
did
you
see
monsieur
albert
over
there
it
was
really
young
lhomme
in
the
midst
of
three
questionable
women
already
intoxicated
he
was
knocking
his
glass
on
the
table
and
talking
of
drubbing
the
waiter
if
he
did
not
bring
some
immediately
well
resumed
pauline
there
a
family
for
you
the
mother
is
at
rambouillet
the
father
in
paris
and
the
son
at
joinville
they
tread
on
one
another
toes
denise
though
she
detested
noise
was
smiling
and
tasting
the
delight
of
being
unable
to
think
amid
such
uproar
but
all
at
once
they
heard
a
commotion
in
the
other
room
a
burst
of
voices
which
drowned
all
others
men
were
yelling
and
must
have
come
to
blows
for
one
could
hear
a
scuffle
chairs
falling
quite
a
struggle
indeed
amid
which
the
again
resounded
duck
the
pitch
in
the
sawbones
and
when
the
landlord
loud
voice
had
calmed
this
tempest
hutin
wearing
a
red
jersey
and
with
a
little
cap
at
the
back
of
his
head
suddenly
made
his
appearance
having
on
his
arm
the
tall
fair
girl
who
had
been
steering
his
boat
and
who
by
way
of
wearing
the
colours
had
planted
a
bunch
of
poppies
behind
her
ear
clamorous
applause
greeted
their
entry
and
hutin
his
face
beaming
with
pride
at
thus
being
remarked
threw
his
chest
forward
and
assumed
a
nautical
rolling
gait
displaying
the
while
a
bruised
cheek
quite
blue
from
a
blow
he
had
received
behind
him
and
his
companion
followed
the
crew
they
took
a
table
by
storm
and
the
uproar
became
deafening
it
appears
explained
baugé
after
listening
to
the
conversation
behind
him
it
appears
that
the
students
recognised
the
woman
with
hutin
as
an
old
friend
from
their
neighbourhood
who
now
sings
in
a
at
montmartre
so
they
were
kicking
up
a
row
about
her
in
any
case
said
pauline
stiffly
she
precious
ugly
with
her
carroty
hair
really
i
do
know
where
monsieur
hutin
picks
them
up
but
they
an
ugly
dirty
lot
denise
had
turned
pale
and
felt
an
icy
coldness
as
if
her
blood
were
flowing
away
drop
by
drop
already
on
seeing
the
boats
from
the
bank
she
had
felt
a
shiver
but
now
she
no
longer
had
any
doubt
at
seeing
that
girl
with
hutin
with
trembling
hands
and
a
choking
sensation
in
her
throat
she
suddenly
ceased
to
eat
what
the
matter
asked
her
friend
nothing
she
stammered
but
it
rather
warm
here
however
hutin
table
was
close
to
theirs
and
when
hutin
perceived
baugé
whom
he
knew
he
commenced
a
conversation
in
a
shrill
voice
in
order
to
attract
further
attention
i
say
he
cried
are
you
as
virtuous
as
ever
at
the
bon
marché
not
so
much
as
all
that
replied
baugé
turning
very
red
that
wo
do
you
know
there
a
confessional
box
at
your
place
for
the
salesmen
who
venture
to
look
at
the
young
ladies
there
no
no
a
house
where
they
insist
on
their
employees
marrying
that
wo
do
for
me
the
other
fellows
began
to
laugh
and
liénard
who
was
one
of
crew
added
some
jocular
remark
about
the
louvre
establishment
at
which
pauline
herself
burst
into
a
merry
peal
baugé
however
was
annoyed
by
the
joke
about
the
staid
propriety
and
innocence
of
his
establishment
and
all
at
once
he
retorted
oh
you
need
talk
you
are
not
so
well
off
at
the
ladies
paradise
sacked
for
the
slightest
thing
and
a
governor
too
who
is
always
smirking
round
his
lady
customers
hutin
no
longer
listened
to
him
but
began
to
praise
the
place
clichy
establishment
he
knew
a
girl
there
who
was
so
inexpressibly
dignified
that
customers
dared
not
speak
to
her
for
fear
of
humiliating
her
then
drawing
up
closer
he
related
that
he
had
made
a
hundred
and
fifteen
francs
that
week
oh
a
capital
week
favier
had
been
left
behind
with
merely
francs
in
fact
the
whole
lot
had
been
floored
and
it
could
be
seen
that
he
was
telling
the
truth
he
was
squandering
his
cash
as
fast
as
possible
and
did
not
mean
to
go
to
bed
till
he
had
rid
himself
of
the
hundred
and
fifteen
francs
then
as
he
gradually
became
intoxicated
he
fell
foul
of
robineau
that
fool
of
a
who
affected
to
keep
himself
apart
to
such
a
point
that
he
refused
to
walk
down
the
street
with
one
of
his
salesmen
shut
up
said
liénard
you
talk
too
much
old
man
the
heat
had
yet
increased
the
candles
were
guttering
down
on
to
the
and
through
the
open
windows
whenever
the
noise
within
ceased
for
an
instant
there
came
a
distant
prolonged
murmur
the
voice
of
the
river
and
of
the
lofty
poplars
falling
asleep
in
the
calm
night
baugé
had
just
called
for
the
bill
seeing
that
denise
was
no
better
indeed
she
was
now
quite
white
choking
from
the
tears
she
withheld
however
the
waiter
did
not
appear
and
she
had
to
submit
to
more
of
hutin
loud
talk
he
was
now
boasting
of
being
much
superior
to
liénard
because
liénard
simply
squandered
his
money
whereas
he
hutin
spent
his
own
earnings
the
fruit
of
his
intelligence
at
last
baugé
paid
and
the
two
girls
went
out
denise
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
for
a
moment
she
had
thought
she
was
going
to
die
in
that
suffocating
heat
amidst
all
those
cries
and
she
still
attributed
her
faintness
to
want
of
air
at
present
she
could
breathe
freely
in
the
freshness
of
the
starry
night
as
the
two
young
women
were
leaving
the
garden
of
the
restaurant
a
timid
voice
murmured
in
the
shade
good
evening
ladies
it
was
deloche
they
had
not
seen
him
at
the
further
end
of
the
front
room
where
he
had
been
dining
alone
after
coming
from
paris
on
foot
for
the
pleasure
of
the
walk
on
recognising
his
friendly
voice
denise
suffering
as
she
was
yielded
mechanically
to
the
need
of
some
support
monsieur
deloche
said
she
are
you
coming
back
with
us
give
me
your
arm
pauline
and
baugé
had
already
gone
on
in
front
they
were
astonished
never
thinking
it
would
turn
out
like
that
and
with
that
fellow
above
all
however
as
there
was
still
an
hour
before
the
train
started
they
went
to
the
end
of
the
island
following
the
bank
under
the
tall
poplars
and
from
time
to
time
they
turned
round
murmuring
but
where
have
they
got
to
ah
there
they
are
it
rather
funny
all
the
same
at
first
denise
and
deloche
remained
silent
the
uproar
from
the
restaurant
was
slowly
dying
away
changing
into
a
musical
sweetness
in
the
calmness
of
the
night
and
still
feverish
from
that
furnace
whose
lights
were
disappearing
one
by
one
behind
the
foliage
they
went
further
in
amidst
the
coolness
of
the
trees
opposite
them
there
was
a
sort
of
shadowy
wall
a
mass
of
shadow
so
dense
that
they
could
not
even
distinguish
any
trace
of
the
path
however
they
went
forward
quietly
without
fear
then
their
eyes
getting
more
accustomed
to
the
darkness
they
saw
on
the
right
hand
the
trunks
of
the
poplar
trees
resembling
sombre
columns
upholding
the
domes
of
their
branches
between
which
gleamed
the
stars
whilst
the
water
occasionally
shone
like
a
mirror
the
wind
was
falling
and
they
no
longer
heard
anything
but
the
loud
flow
of
the
stream
i
am
very
pleased
to
have
met
you
stammered
deloche
at
last
making
up
his
mind
to
speak
first
you
ca
think
how
happy
you
render
me
in
consenting
to
walk
with
me
and
aided
by
the
darkness
after
many
awkward
attempts
he
ventured
to
tell
her
that
he
loved
her
he
had
long
wanted
to
write
to
her
and
tell
her
so
but
perhaps
she
would
never
have
known
it
had
it
not
been
for
that
lovely
night
coming
to
his
assistance
that
water
which
murmured
so
softly
and
those
trees
which
screened
them
with
their
shade
however
she
did
not
reply
she
continued
to
walk
by
his
side
with
the
same
suffering
air
and
he
was
trying
to
gaze
into
her
face
when
all
at
once
he
heard
a
sob
oh
good
heavens
he
exclaimed
you
are
crying
mademoiselle
you
are
crying
have
i
offended
you
no
no
she
murmured
she
strove
to
keep
back
her
tears
but
could
not
do
so
even
whilst
she
was
at
table
she
had
thought
that
her
heart
was
about
to
burst
and
now
in
the
darkness
she
surrendered
herself
to
her
sensibility
stifled
by
her
sobs
and
thinking
that
if
hutin
had
been
in
deloche
place
and
had
said
such
tender
things
to
her
she
would
have
been
unable
to
say
nay
but
this
suddenly
filled
her
with
confusion
and
a
burning
flush
of
shame
suffused
her
face
i
did
mean
to
offend
you
continued
deloche
almost
crying
also
no
but
listen
she
replied
her
voice
still
trembling
i
am
not
at
all
angry
with
you
but
never
speak
to
me
again
as
you
have
just
done
oh
you
a
good
fellow
and
i
quite
willing
to
be
your
friend
but
nothing
more
you
understand
your
friend
he
quivered
and
after
a
few
steps
taken
in
silence
he
stammered
in
fact
you
do
love
me
and
then
as
she
spared
him
the
pain
of
a
brutal
no
he
resumed
in
a
soft
voice
oh
i
was
prepared
for
it
i
have
never
had
any
luck
i
know
i
can
never
be
happy
at
home
they
used
to
beat
me
in
paris
i
always
been
a
drudge
you
see
when
a
chap
does
know
how
to
rob
other
fellows
of
their
sweethearts
and
is
too
awkward
to
earn
as
much
as
the
others
why
the
best
thing
he
can
do
is
to
go
into
some
corner
and
die
never
fear
i
sha
torment
you
any
more
as
for
loving
you
you
ca
prevent
me
can
you
i
shall
love
you
like
a
dog
there
everything
escapes
me
that
my
luck
in
life
and
then
he
too
burst
into
tears
she
tried
to
console
him
and
in
their
friendly
effusion
they
found
they
belonged
to
the
same
part
of
the
country
she
to
valognes
he
to
briquebec
eight
miles
from
each
other
and
this
proved
a
fresh
tie
his
father
a
poor
needy
sickly
jealous
had
been
wont
to
drub
him
exasperated
by
his
long
pale
face
and
hair
which
said
he
did
not
belong
to
the
family
then
they
got
to
talking
of
the
vast
cotentin
pastures
surrounded
with
hedges
of
the
shady
paths
and
lanes
winding
beneath
elm
trees
and
of
the
grass
grown
roads
like
alleys
in
a
park
around
them
the
night
was
yet
paling
and
they
could
distinguish
the
rushes
on
the
banks
and
the
lacework
of
the
foliage
black
against
the
twinkling
stars
and
a
peacefulness
came
over
them
they
forgot
their
troubles
brought
closer
together
to
a
cordial
feeling
of
friendship
by
their
well
asked
pauline
of
denise
taking
her
aside
when
they
reached
the
station
the
young
girl
who
understood
her
friend
meaning
by
her
smile
and
stare
of
tender
curiosity
turned
very
red
and
answered
oh
no
my
dear
remember
what
i
told
you
but
he
belongs
to
my
part
of
the
country
we
were
talking
about
valognes
pauline
and
baugé
were
perplexed
put
out
in
their
ideas
not
knowing
what
to
think
deloche
left
them
on
the
place
de
la
bastille
like
all
young
probationers
he
slept
in
the
house
and
had
to
be
back
by
eleven
not
wishing
to
go
in
with
him
denise
who
had
obtained
what
was
called
theatre
leave
which
allowed
her
to
remain
out
till
past
midnight
accepted
baugé
invitation
to
accompany
pauline
to
his
home
in
the
rue
they
took
a
cab
and
on
the
way
denise
was
stupefied
to
learn
that
her
friend
would
not
return
to
the
paradise
till
the
morrow
having
squared
matters
with
madame
cabin
by
giving
her
a
piece
baugé
who
did
the
honours
of
his
room
which
was
furnished
with
some
old
empire
furniture
given
him
by
his
father
got
angry
when
denise
spoke
of
settling
up
but
at
last
accepted
the
fifteen
francs
twelve
sous
which
she
had
laid
on
the
chest
of
drawers
however
he
insisted
on
making
her
a
cup
of
tea
and
after
struggling
with
a
and
saucepan
was
obliged
to
go
and
fetch
some
sugar
midnight
struck
as
he
was
pouring
out
the
tea
i
must
be
off
said
denise
presently
replied
pauline
the
theatres
do
close
so
early
denise
however
felt
uncomfortable
in
that
bachelor
room
and
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
she
contrived
to
slip
away
the
private
door
which
conducted
to
mouret
apartments
and
to
the
assistants
bedrooms
was
in
the
rue
madame
cabin
opened
it
by
pulling
a
string
and
then
gave
a
glance
in
order
to
see
who
was
returning
a
was
burning
dimly
in
the
hall
and
denise
on
finding
herself
in
this
uncertain
glimmer
hesitated
and
was
seized
with
fear
for
a
moment
previously
on
turning
the
corner
of
the
street
she
had
seen
the
door
close
on
the
shadowy
figure
of
a
man
it
must
have
been
the
governor
coming
home
from
a
party
and
the
idea
that
he
was
there
in
the
dark
possibly
waiting
for
her
caused
her
one
of
those
strange
fears
with
which
he
still
inspired
her
without
any
reasonable
cause
some
one
was
certainly
moving
about
on
the
for
she
heard
a
creaking
of
boots
whereupon
quite
losing
her
head
she
opened
a
door
which
led
into
the
shop
and
which
was
always
left
unlocked
for
the
to
make
his
rounds
on
entering
she
found
herself
in
the
printed
cotton
department
good
heavens
what
shall
i
do
she
stammered
in
her
emotion
then
the
idea
occurred
to
her
that
there
was
another
door
upstairs
leading
to
the
bedrooms
but
to
reach
it
she
would
have
to
go
right
across
the
shop
she
preferred
this
however
notwithstanding
the
darkness
reigning
in
the
galleries
not
a
was
burning
there
only
a
few
lighted
hung
here
and
there
from
the
branches
of
the
chandeliers
and
these
scattered
lights
like
yellow
specks
fading
away
in
the
gloom
resembled
the
lanterns
hung
up
in
mines
big
shadows
loomed
before
her
she
could
hardly
distinguish
the
piles
of
goods
which
assumed
all
sorts
of
threatening
aspects
now
they
looked
like
fallen
columns
now
like
squatting
beasts
and
now
like
lurking
thieves
the
heavy
silence
broken
by
distant
breathing
moreover
increased
the
darkness
however
she
found
her
way
from
the
linen
department
on
her
left
came
a
paler
gleam
bluey
like
a
house
front
under
a
summer
sky
at
night
then
she
wished
to
cross
the
central
hall
but
on
running
up
against
some
piles
of
printed
calico
she
thought
it
safer
to
traverse
the
hosiery
department
and
then
the
woollen
one
there
she
was
frightened
by
a
loud
noise
of
snoring
it
was
joseph
the
messenger
sleeping
behind
some
mourning
articles
she
then
quickly
ran
into
the
hall
where
the
skylight
cast
a
sort
of
crepuscular
light
which
made
it
appear
larger
and
with
its
motionless
shelves
and
the
shadows
of
its
describing
reversed
crosses
lent
it
the
aspect
of
a
church
at
night
and
she
indeed
full
of
fear
now
fairly
fled
in
the
mercery
and
glove
departments
she
nearly
trod
on
some
more
assistants
and
only
felt
safe
when
she
at
last
found
herself
on
the
staircase
but
up
above
just
outside
the
mantle
department
she
was
again
seized
with
terror
on
perceiving
a
lantern
twinkling
in
the
darkness
and
moving
forward
it
was
the
patrol
of
two
firemen
marking
their
passage
on
the
faces
of
the
indicators
she
stood
still
for
a
moment
failing
to
understand
their
business
and
watched
them
passing
from
among
the
shawls
to
the
furniture
and
then
on
to
the
department
terrified
the
while
by
their
strange
manœuvres
by
the
grating
of
their
keys
and
the
closing
of
the
iron
doors
which
shut
with
a
resounding
clang
when
they
approached
she
took
refuge
in
the
lace
department
but
suddenly
heard
herself
called
by
name
and
thereupon
ran
off
to
the
door
conducting
to
the
private
stairs
she
had
recognised
deloche
voice
he
slept
in
his
department
on
a
little
iron
bedstead
which
he
set
up
himself
every
evening
and
he
was
not
asleep
yet
but
with
open
eyes
was
rememorating
aloud
the
pleasant
hours
he
had
spent
that
evening
what
it
you
mademoiselle
said
mouret
whom
denise
despite
all
her
manœuvring
found
before
her
on
the
staircase
a
small
in
his
hand
she
stammered
and
tried
to
explain
that
she
had
been
to
look
for
something
but
he
was
not
angry
he
gazed
at
her
with
his
paternal
and
at
the
same
time
inquisitive
air
you
had
permission
to
go
to
the
theatre
then
yes
sir
and
have
you
enjoyed
yourself
what
theatre
did
you
go
to
i
have
been
in
the
country
sir
this
made
him
laugh
then
laying
a
certain
stress
on
his
words
he
added
all
alone
no
sir
with
a
lady
friend
she
replied
her
cheeks
burning
shocked
as
she
was
by
the
suspicion
which
his
words
implied
he
said
no
more
but
he
was
still
looking
at
her
in
her
simple
black
dress
and
bonnet
trimmed
with
a
strip
of
blue
ribbon
was
this
little
savage
going
to
turn
out
a
pretty
girl
she
looked
all
the
better
for
her
day
in
the
open
air
quite
charming
indeed
with
her
splendid
hair
waving
over
her
forehead
and
he
who
during
the
last
six
months
had
treated
her
like
a
child
sometimes
giving
her
advice
yielding
to
a
desire
to
inform
himself
to
a
wicked
wish
to
know
how
a
woman
grew
up
and
became
lost
in
paris
no
longer
laughed
but
experienced
a
feeling
of
surprise
and
fear
mingled
with
tenderness
no
doubt
it
was
a
lover
who
was
improving
her
like
this
at
this
thought
he
felt
as
if
pecked
to
the
heart
by
a
favourite
bird
with
which
he
had
been
playing
good
night
sir
murmured
denise
continuing
on
her
way
without
waiting
he
did
not
answer
but
remained
watching
her
till
she
had
disappeared
and
then
he
entered
his
own
apartments
chapter
vi
when
the
dead
summer
season
arrived
quite
a
hurricane
of
panic
swept
through
the
ladies
paradise
the
reign
of
terror
terror
of
dismissal
commenced
many
employees
were
sent
away
on
leave
and
others
were
dismissed
in
dozens
by
the
principals
bent
on
clearing
the
shop
as
no
customers
appeared
there
during
the
july
and
august
heat
mouret
on
making
his
daily
round
with
bourdoncle
would
call
aside
the
managers
whom
he
had
prompted
during
the
winter
to
engage
more
men
than
were
really
necessary
in
order
that
the
business
might
not
suffer
but
it
was
now
a
question
of
reducing
expenses
and
this
was
effected
by
casting
quite
a
third
of
the
shop
people
the
weak
ones
who
allowed
themselves
to
be
swallowed
up
by
the
strong
ones
on
to
the
pavements
again
come
he
would
say
you
must
have
some
who
do
suit
you
we
keep
them
all
this
time
doing
nothing
and
if
the
manager
hesitated
hardly
knowing
whom
to
sacrifice
he
would
continue
make
your
own
arrangements
six
salesmen
must
suffice
you
can
take
on
others
in
october
there
are
always
plenty
to
be
had
moreover
bourdoncle
undertook
the
executions
he
had
a
terrible
way
of
saying
go
and
be
paid
which
fell
on
the
poor
devil
he
had
singled
out
like
a
blow
from
an
axe
anything
served
him
as
a
pretext
for
clearing
off
the
superfluous
staff
he
invented
misdeeds
speculating
on
the
slightest
negligence
you
were
sitting
down
sir
go
and
get
paid
you
dare
to
answer
me
go
and
get
paid
your
shoes
have
not
been
blackened
go
and
get
paid
and
even
the
bravest
trembled
in
presence
of
the
massacre
which
he
left
behind
him
then
this
system
not
working
quickly
enough
he
invented
a
trap
by
which
in
a
few
days
and
without
fatigue
he
got
rid
of
the
number
of
salesmen
condemned
beforehand
at
eight
he
took
his
stand
at
the
door
watch
in
hand
and
at
three
minutes
past
the
hour
the
breathless
young
people
who
arrived
were
greeted
with
his
implacable
go
and
get
paid
this
was
a
quick
and
cleanly
manner
of
doing
the
work
you
an
ugly
mug
he
ended
by
saying
one
day
to
a
poor
devil
whose
nose
all
on
one
side
annoyed
him
go
and
get
paid
the
favoured
ones
obtained
a
fortnight
holiday
without
pay
which
was
a
more
humane
way
of
lessening
the
expenses
moreover
the
salesmen
quietly
accepted
their
precarious
situation
obliged
to
do
so
by
necessity
and
habit
since
their
arrival
in
paris
they
had
roamed
about
commencing
their
apprenticeship
here
finishing
it
there
getting
dismissed
or
they
themselves
resigning
all
at
once
just
as
interest
dictated
when
business
slackened
the
workmen
lost
their
daily
bread
and
this
went
on
amidst
the
subdued
working
of
the
machine
the
useless
gear
was
quietly
thrown
aside
like
so
much
old
plant
there
was
no
gratitude
shown
for
services
rendered
so
much
the
worse
for
those
who
did
not
know
how
to
look
after
themselves
nothing
else
was
now
talked
of
in
the
various
departments
fresh
stories
circulated
every
day
the
dismissed
salesmen
were
named
in
the
same
way
as
one
counts
the
dead
in
time
of
cholera
the
shawl
and
the
woollen
departments
suffered
especially
seven
employees
disappeared
from
them
in
one
week
then
quite
a
drama
threw
the
department
into
confusion
a
customer
nearly
fainting
away
accused
the
young
person
who
had
served
her
of
eating
garlic
and
the
latter
was
dismissed
at
once
although
badly
fed
and
dying
of
hunger
she
had
simply
been
finishing
a
collection
of
at
the
counter
however
the
authorities
showed
themselves
pitiless
at
the
least
complaint
from
customers
no
excuse
was
admitted
the
employee
was
always
wrong
and
had
to
disappear
like
a
defective
instrument
which
interfered
with
the
proper
working
of
the
business
and
the
others
bowed
their
heads
not
even
attempting
any
defence
in
the
panic
which
was
raging
each
trembled
for
himself
mignot
going
out
one
day
with
a
parcel
under
his
coat
notwithstanding
the
regulations
was
nearly
caught
and
really
thought
himself
lost
liénard
celebrated
for
his
idleness
was
simply
indebted
to
his
father
position
in
the
drapery
trade
for
not
being
turned
away
one
afternoon
when
bourdoncle
found
him
dozing
between
two
piles
of
english
velvets
but
the
lhommes
were
especially
anxious
each
day
expecting
to
see
their
son
albert
sent
away
as
the
principals
were
very
dissatisfied
with
his
conduct
at
his
he
frequently
had
women
there
who
diverted
his
attention
from
his
work
and
twice
already
madame
aurélie
had
been
obliged
to
plead
for
him
denise
was
so
menaced
amid
this
general
clearance
that
she
lived
in
constant
expectation
of
a
catastrophe
it
was
in
vain
that
she
summoned
up
her
courage
struggling
with
all
her
gaiety
and
all
her
reason
in
the
endeavour
not
to
yield
to
the
misgivings
of
her
tender
nature
she
burst
into
blinding
tears
as
soon
as
she
had
closed
the
door
of
her
bedroom
in
desolation
at
the
thought
of
finding
herself
in
the
street
on
bad
terms
with
her
uncle
not
knowing
where
to
go
without
a
copper
saved
and
with
the
two
children
to
look
after
the
sensations
she
had
experienced
during
the
first
few
weeks
again
returned
she
fancied
herself
a
grain
of
seed
under
a
powerful
millstone
and
utter
discouragement
came
over
her
at
the
thought
of
what
a
small
atom
she
was
in
this
great
machine
which
would
certainly
crush
her
with
its
quiet
indifference
there
was
no
illusion
possible
if
they
dismissed
any
one
from
her
department
it
would
certainly
be
herself
during
the
rambouillet
excursion
no
doubt
the
other
young
ladies
had
incensed
madame
aurélie
against
her
for
since
then
that
lady
had
treated
her
with
an
air
of
severity
into
which
entered
a
certain
rancour
besides
they
could
not
forgive
her
for
going
to
joinville
regarding
it
as
a
sign
of
revolt
a
means
of
setting
the
whole
department
at
defiance
by
exhibiting
herself
out
of
doors
with
a
young
lady
from
a
rival
counter
never
had
denise
suffered
so
much
in
the
department
and
she
now
gave
up
all
hope
of
conquering
it
let
them
alone
repeated
pauline
a
lot
of
things
as
stupid
as
geese
but
it
was
just
these
airs
which
intimidated
denise
nearly
all
the
saleswomen
by
their
daily
contact
with
rich
customers
acquired
certain
graces
and
finished
by
forming
a
vague
nameless
class
something
between
a
and
a
lady
but
beneath
their
art
in
dress
and
the
manners
and
phrases
they
had
learnt
by
rote
there
was
often
only
a
false
superficial
education
the
fruit
of
reading
worthless
papers
attending
cheap
theatres
and
and
picking
up
all
the
current
stupidities
of
paris
you
know
the
one
has
got
a
child
said
clara
one
morning
on
arriving
in
the
department
and
as
the
others
seemed
astonished
she
continued
yes
i
saw
her
yesterday
myself
taking
the
child
out
for
a
walk
she
got
it
stowed
away
in
the
neighbourhood
somewhere
two
days
later
marguerite
came
up
after
dinner
with
another
piece
of
news
a
nice
thing
i
just
seen
the
unkempt
one
sweetheart
a
workman
just
fancy
yes
a
dirty
little
workman
with
yellow
hair
who
was
watching
her
through
the
windows
from
that
moment
it
became
an
accepted
fact
denise
had
a
workman
for
a
lover
and
an
infant
concealed
somewhere
in
the
neighbourhood
they
overwhelmed
her
with
spiteful
allusions
the
first
time
she
understood
them
she
turned
quite
pale
at
the
monstrosity
of
their
suppositions
it
was
abominable
she
tried
to
explain
and
stammered
out
but
they
are
my
brothers
oh
oh
her
brothers
said
clara
in
a
bantering
tone
madame
aurélie
was
obliged
to
interfere
be
quiet
young
ladies
you
had
better
go
on
changing
those
tickets
mademoiselle
baudu
is
quite
free
to
misbehave
herself
out
of
doors
if
only
she
worked
a
bit
when
she
is
here
this
curt
defence
was
a
condemnation
the
poor
girl
suffocating
as
if
they
had
accused
her
of
a
crime
vainly
endeavoured
to
explain
the
facts
they
laughed
and
shrugged
their
shoulders
and
she
felt
wounded
to
the
heart
on
hearing
the
rumours
deloche
was
so
indignant
that
he
wanted
to
slap
the
faces
of
the
young
ladies
in
denise
department
and
was
only
restrained
from
doing
so
by
the
fear
of
compromising
her
since
the
evening
at
joinville
he
had
harboured
a
submissive
love
an
almost
religious
friendship
for
her
which
he
proved
by
his
faithful
doglike
looks
he
was
careful
not
to
show
his
affection
before
the
others
for
they
would
have
laughed
at
him
still
that
did
not
prevent
him
dreaming
of
the
avenging
blow
he
would
deal
if
ever
any
one
should
attack
her
in
his
presence
denise
finished
by
not
answering
the
insults
it
was
all
too
odious
nobody
would
believe
it
when
any
of
her
companions
ventured
a
fresh
allusion
she
contented
herself
with
looking
at
her
with
a
sad
calm
air
besides
she
had
other
troubles
material
anxieties
which
took
up
her
attention
jean
went
on
as
badly
as
ever
always
worrying
her
for
money
hardly
a
week
passed
that
she
did
not
receive
some
fresh
story
from
him
four
pages
long
and
when
the
house
postman
brought
her
these
letters
in
a
big
passionate
handwriting
she
hastened
to
hide
them
in
her
pocket
for
the
saleswomen
affected
to
laugh
and
hummed
snatches
of
some
doubtful
ditties
then
after
inventing
some
pretext
to
enable
her
to
go
to
the
other
end
of
the
establishment
and
read
these
letters
she
became
full
of
fear
poor
jean
seemed
to
be
lost
all
his
fibs
succeeded
with
her
she
believed
in
all
his
extraordinary
love
adventures
her
complete
ignorance
of
such
things
making
her
exaggerate
his
dangers
sometimes
it
was
a
piece
he
wanted
to
enable
him
to
escape
some
woman
jealousy
at
other
times
five
francs
six
francs
to
get
some
poor
girl
out
of
a
scrape
as
her
father
would
otherwise
kill
her
and
so
as
her
salary
and
commission
did
not
suffice
denise
conceived
the
idea
of
looking
for
a
little
work
after
business
hours
she
spoke
about
it
to
robineau
who
had
shown
a
certain
sympathy
for
her
since
their
first
meeting
at
vinçard
and
he
procured
her
the
making
of
some
neckties
at
five
sous
a
dozen
at
night
between
nine
and
one
she
could
sew
six
dozen
of
these
which
represented
thirty
sous
out
of
which
she
had
to
deduct
four
sous
for
a
candle
and
as
this
sum
kept
jean
going
she
did
not
complain
of
the
want
of
sleep
and
would
have
thought
herself
very
happy
had
not
another
catastrophe
once
more
upset
her
budgetary
calculations
at
the
end
of
the
second
fortnight
when
she
went
to
the
she
found
the
door
closed
the
woman
had
failed
become
bankrupt
thus
carrying
off
her
eighteen
francs
six
sous
a
considerable
sum
on
which
she
had
been
relying
for
the
last
week
all
the
annoyances
she
experienced
in
the
department
disappeared
before
this
disaster
you
seem
worried
said
pauline
meeting
her
one
day
in
the
furniture
gallery
looking
very
pale
are
you
in
want
of
anything
but
as
denise
already
owed
her
friend
twelve
francs
she
tried
to
smile
and
replied
no
thanks
i
not
slept
well
that
all
it
was
the
twentieth
of
july
and
the
panic
caused
by
the
dismissals
was
at
its
height
out
of
the
four
hundred
employees
bourdoncle
had
already
sacked
fifty
and
there
were
rumours
of
fresh
executions
she
however
thought
but
little
of
the
menaces
which
were
flying
about
entirely
absorbed
as
she
was
by
the
anguish
caused
her
by
one
of
adventures
an
adventure
yet
more
terrifying
than
any
previous
one
that
very
day
he
wanted
fifteen
francs
which
sum
alone
could
save
him
from
somebody
vengeance
on
the
previous
evening
she
had
received
the
first
letter
opening
the
drama
then
one
after
the
other
had
come
two
more
and
in
the
last
the
perusal
of
which
she
was
finishing
when
pauline
met
her
jean
had
announced
his
death
for
that
evening
if
she
did
not
send
the
money
she
was
in
agony
she
could
take
the
sum
out
of
pépé
board
money
as
this
she
had
paid
away
two
days
before
every
sort
of
bad
luck
was
pursuing
her
for
she
had
hoped
to
get
her
eighteen
francs
six
sous
through
robineau
who
might
perhaps
be
able
to
find
the
but
robineau
having
got
a
holiday
had
not
returned
on
the
previous
night
though
expected
to
do
so
however
pauline
still
questioned
her
in
a
friendly
way
whenever
they
met
in
an
department
they
would
thus
converse
for
a
few
minutes
keeping
a
sharp
the
while
and
suddenly
pauline
made
a
move
as
if
to
run
off
having
observed
the
white
tie
of
an
inspector
coming
out
of
the
shawl
department
ah
it
only
old
jouve
she
murmured
in
a
relieved
tone
i
think
what
makes
the
old
man
grin
as
he
does
when
he
sees
us
together
in
your
place
i
should
beware
for
he
too
kind
to
you
he
an
old
humbug
as
spiteful
as
a
cat
and
thinks
he
still
got
his
troopers
to
talk
to
this
was
quite
true
jouve
was
detested
by
all
the
salespeople
for
his
severity
more
than
half
the
dismissals
were
the
result
of
his
reports
and
rakish
that
he
was
with
a
big
red
nose
he
only
shewed
himself
lenient
in
the
departments
served
by
women
thus
though
he
must
have
perceived
denise
and
pauline
he
went
away
pretending
not
to
see
them
and
they
heard
him
dropping
on
a
salesman
of
the
lace
department
guilty
of
watching
a
fallen
horse
in
the
rue
by
the
way
resumed
pauline
were
you
looking
for
monsieur
robineau
yesterday
he
come
back
at
this
denise
thought
herself
saved
thanks
said
she
i
go
round
the
other
way
then
and
pass
through
the
silk
department
so
much
the
worse
they
sent
me
upstairs
to
the
to
fetch
a
bodkin
and
thereupon
they
separated
the
young
girl
with
a
busy
look
as
if
she
were
running
from
to
in
search
of
something
reached
the
stairs
and
went
down
into
the
hall
it
was
a
quarter
to
ten
the
first
had
rung
a
warm
sun
was
playing
on
the
windows
and
in
spite
of
the
grey
linen
blinds
the
heat
penetrated
the
stagnant
air
now
and
then
a
refreshing
breath
arose
from
the
floor
which
some
assistants
were
gently
watering
a
somnolence
a
summer
siesta
reigned
in
all
the
vacant
spaces
around
the
counters
you
might
have
thought
yourself
in
a
church
wrapt
in
sleeping
shadow
after
the
last
mass
some
salesmen
were
standing
about
listlessly
and
a
few
rare
customers
crossed
the
galleries
and
the
hall
with
the
indolent
step
of
women
annoyed
by
the
sun
just
as
denise
went
down
favier
was
measuring
a
dress
length
of
light
silk
with
pink
spots
for
madame
boutarel
who
had
arrived
in
paris
from
the
south
on
the
previous
day
since
the
commencement
of
the
month
the
provinces
had
been
sending
up
their
detachments
you
saw
nothing
but
dames
in
yellow
shawls
green
skirts
and
flaring
bonnets
but
the
shopmen
were
even
too
indolent
to
laugh
at
them
favier
accompanied
madame
boutarel
to
the
mercery
department
and
on
returning
remarked
to
hutin
yesterday
they
were
all
auvergnat
women
they
all
provençales
i
sick
of
them
but
just
then
hutin
rushed
forward
for
it
was
his
turn
and
he
had
recognised
the
pretty
lady
the
lovely
blonde
thus
nicknamed
by
the
department
which
knew
nothing
about
her
not
even
her
name
they
all
smiled
at
her
not
a
week
passed
without
her
coming
to
the
paradise
hitherto
always
alone
this
time
however
she
had
a
little
boy
of
four
or
five
with
her
and
this
gave
rise
to
various
comments
she
married
then
asked
favier
when
hutin
returned
from
the
where
he
had
debited
her
with
thirty
yards
of
duchess
satin
possibly
replied
he
although
the
youngster
proves
nothing
perhaps
he
belongs
to
a
lady
friend
what
certain
is
that
she
must
have
been
weeping
she
was
awfully
melancholy
and
her
eyes
were
so
red
a
silence
ensued
the
two
salesmen
gazed
vaguely
into
the
depths
of
the
shop
then
favier
resumed
in
a
low
voice
if
she
married
perhaps
her
husband
smacked
her
face
possibly
repeated
hutin
unless
a
lover
has
played
her
false
and
after
a
fresh
silence
he
added
any
way
i
do
care
a
hang
at
this
moment
denise
crossed
the
silk
department
slackening
her
steps
and
looking
around
her
in
search
of
robineau
she
could
not
see
him
so
she
went
into
the
linen
department
then
passed
through
again
the
two
salesmen
had
noticed
her
movements
there
that
bag
of
bones
again
murmured
hutin
she
looking
for
robineau
said
favier
i
ca
think
what
they
get
up
to
together
oh
nothing
wrong
but
they
say
robineau
has
procured
her
a
little
work
some
neckties
what
a
spec
eh
hutin
was
meditating
something
spiteful
and
when
denise
passed
near
him
he
stopped
her
saying
is
it
me
you
looking
for
she
turned
very
red
since
the
joinville
excursion
she
had
not
dared
to
read
her
heart
full
of
confused
sensations
she
was
constantly
recalling
his
appearance
with
that
girl
and
if
she
still
trembled
before
him
it
was
doubtless
from
uneasiness
had
she
ever
loved
him
did
she
love
him
still
she
hardly
liked
to
stir
up
these
things
which
were
painful
to
her
no
sir
she
replied
embarrassed
hutin
thereupon
began
to
laugh
at
her
uneasy
manner
would
you
like
us
to
serve
him
to
you
favier
just
serve
robineau
to
this
young
lady
she
looked
at
him
fixedly
with
the
sad
calm
look
with
which
she
had
met
the
wounding
remarks
made
by
the
girls
her
companions
ah
so
he
was
spiteful
he
attacked
her
as
well
as
the
others
and
she
felt
a
sort
of
supreme
anguish
the
breaking
of
a
last
tie
her
face
expressed
such
real
suffering
that
favier
although
not
of
a
very
tender
nature
came
to
her
assistance
monsieur
robineau
has
gone
out
to
match
some
goods
said
he
no
doubt
he
will
be
back
for
lunch
you
find
him
here
this
afternoon
if
you
want
to
speak
to
him
denise
thanked
him
and
went
up
to
her
department
where
madame
aurélie
was
waiting
for
her
in
a
terrible
rage
what
she
had
been
gone
half
an
hour
where
had
she
just
sprung
from
not
from
the
that
was
quite
certain
the
poor
girl
hung
her
head
thinking
of
this
avalanche
of
misfortunes
all
would
be
over
if
robineau
should
not
come
in
however
she
resolved
to
go
down
again
later
on
in
the
silk
department
robineau
return
had
provoked
quite
a
revolution
the
salesmen
had
hoped
that
disgusted
with
the
annoyances
they
were
incessantly
causing
him
he
would
not
return
to
the
establishment
and
in
fact
there
was
a
moment
when
pressed
by
vinçard
to
take
over
his
business
he
had
almost
decided
to
do
so
hutin
secret
labour
the
mine
which
he
had
been
laying
under
the
feet
for
months
past
was
about
to
explode
during
robineau
holidays
he
had
temporarily
taken
his
place
and
had
done
his
best
to
injure
him
in
the
minds
of
the
principals
and
secure
possession
of
his
situation
by
excess
of
zeal
he
discovered
and
reported
all
sorts
of
trifling
irregularities
suggested
improvements
and
invented
new
designs
there
was
however
nothing
exceptional
in
all
this
everybody
in
the
department
from
the
unpaid
probationer
longing
to
become
a
salesman
to
the
first
salesman
who
coveted
the
situation
of
manager
had
but
one
fixed
idea
and
that
was
to
dislodge
the
comrade
above
them
to
ascend
another
rung
of
the
ladder
by
knocking
him
over
if
necessary
and
this
battle
of
appetites
this
constant
hurtling
even
contributed
to
the
better
working
of
the
machine
inspiriting
the
sales
and
fanning
the
flame
of
success
which
was
astonishing
paris
behind
hutin
there
was
favier
and
behind
favier
came
the
others
in
a
long
line
you
heard
a
loud
noise
as
of
jaws
working
robineau
was
condemned
and
each
was
grabbing
for
one
of
his
bones
so
when
the
returned
from
his
holiday
there
was
a
general
grumbling
the
matter
had
to
be
settled
at
once
the
salesmen
attitude
appearing
so
menacing
that
the
head
of
the
department
had
sent
robineau
out
to
match
some
goods
at
the
dépôts
of
manufacturers
in
order
to
give
the
authorities
an
opportunity
to
come
to
a
decision
we
would
sooner
all
leave
if
he
is
to
be
kept
declared
hutin
the
affair
greatly
bothered
bouthemont
whose
gaiety
with
such
worries
he
was
pained
to
see
nothing
but
scowling
faces
around
him
nevertheless
he
desired
to
be
just
come
leave
him
alone
he
does
hurt
you
he
said
but
they
protested
energetically
what
does
hurt
us
an
insupportable
being
who
is
always
irritable
and
so
proud
that
he
would
walk
over
one
rather
than
not
pass
this
was
the
great
grievance
of
the
department
robineau
nervous
as
a
woman
was
intolerably
stiff
and
susceptible
they
related
scores
of
stories
about
him
one
poor
little
fellow
had
fallen
ill
through
his
treatment
and
even
lady
customers
had
been
humiliated
by
his
curt
remarks
well
gentlemen
i
wo
take
anything
on
myself
said
bouthemont
i
notified
the
position
to
the
directors
and
am
going
to
speak
about
it
shortly
the
second
lunch
was
being
rung
the
clang
of
a
bell
came
up
from
the
basement
with
a
distant
muffled
sound
in
the
close
air
of
the
shop
hutin
and
favier
went
down
from
all
the
counters
came
salesmen
one
by
one
hastening
through
the
narrow
entrance
to
the
kitchen
passage
down
below
a
damp
passage
always
lighted
by
gas
the
flock
pushed
forward
without
a
laugh
or
a
word
amidst
an
increasing
clatter
of
crockery
and
a
strong
odour
of
food
then
at
the
far
end
of
the
passage
there
was
a
sudden
halt
before
a
wicket
flanked
by
piles
of
plates
and
armed
with
forks
and
spoons
which
he
plunged
into
a
cook
was
distributing
the
portions
and
when
he
stood
aside
the
flaring
kitchen
could
be
seen
beyond
his
belly
of
course
muttered
hutin
consulting
the
bill
of
fare
written
on
a
above
the
wicket
boiled
beef
and
pungent
sauce
or
skate
never
any
roast
meat
in
this
rotten
shop
their
boiled
beef
and
fish
do
do
a
fellow
a
bit
of
good
moreover
the
fish
was
universally
neglected
for
the
pan
was
quite
full
favier
however
took
some
skate
behind
him
hutin
stooped
down
saying
beef
and
sauce
with
a
mechanical
movement
of
his
fork
the
cook
picked
up
a
piece
of
meat
then
poured
a
spoonful
of
sauce
over
it
and
hutin
suffocated
by
the
hot
air
from
the
kitchen
had
hardly
secured
his
portion
before
the
words
beef
pungent
sauce
beef
pungent
sauce
followed
each
other
like
a
litany
whilst
the
cook
continued
to
pick
up
the
meat
and
pour
the
sauce
over
it
with
the
rapid
rhythmical
movement
of
a
clock
but
the
skate
cold
declared
favier
whose
hand
felt
no
warmth
from
the
plate
they
were
now
all
hurrying
along
with
arms
extended
and
plates
held
straight
for
fear
of
running
against
one
another
ten
steps
further
was
the
bar
another
wicket
with
a
shiny
zinc
counter
on
which
were
ranged
the
shares
of
wine
small
bottles
without
corks
and
still
damp
from
rinsing
and
each
took
one
of
these
bottles
in
his
empty
hand
as
he
passed
and
then
completely
laden
made
for
his
table
with
a
serious
air
careful
not
to
spill
anything
hutin
however
grumbled
between
his
teeth
this
is
a
fine
dance
with
all
this
crockery
the
table
at
which
he
and
favier
sat
was
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
in
the
last
the
rooms
were
all
alike
old
cellars
twelve
feet
by
fifteen
which
had
been
cemented
over
and
fitted
up
as
refectories
but
the
damp
came
through
the
the
yellow
walls
were
covered
with
greenish
spots
and
from
the
narrow
windows
opening
on
the
street
on
a
level
with
the
pavement
there
fell
a
livid
light
incessantly
traversed
by
the
vague
shadows
of
in
july
as
in
december
you
stifled
in
the
warm
air
laden
with
nauseous
smells
which
came
from
the
kitchen
near
by
hutin
went
in
first
on
the
table
which
was
fixed
at
one
end
to
the
wall
and
covered
with
american
cloth
there
were
only
the
glasses
knives
and
forks
marking
the
places
a
pile
of
clean
plates
stood
at
each
end
whilst
in
the
middle
was
a
big
loaf
a
knife
sticking
in
it
with
the
handle
in
the
air
hutin
rid
himself
of
his
bottle
and
laid
down
his
plate
then
after
taking
his
napkin
from
the
bottom
of
a
set
of
the
sole
ornament
on
the
walls
he
heaved
a
sigh
and
sat
down
and
i
fearfully
hungry
too
he
murmured
it
always
like
that
replied
favier
seating
himself
on
the
left
nothing
to
eat
when
one
is
starving
the
table
was
rapidly
filling
it
contained
places
at
first
nothing
was
heard
but
a
loud
clattering
of
knives
and
forks
the
gormandizing
of
big
fellows
whom
thirteen
hours
daily
work
incessantly
rendered
hungry
formerly
the
employees
had
been
allowed
an
hour
for
meals
which
had
enabled
them
to
go
to
a
café
and
take
their
coffee
and
they
would
then
despatch
their
dinner
in
twenty
minutes
anxious
to
get
into
the
street
but
this
excited
them
too
much
they
came
back
careless
their
minds
bent
on
other
things
than
business
and
so
the
managers
had
decided
that
they
should
not
go
out
but
pay
an
extra
three
halfpence
for
a
cup
of
coffee
if
they
wanted
one
so
now
they
were
in
no
hurry
but
prolonged
the
meal
being
in
no
wise
anxious
to
go
back
to
work
before
time
between
their
big
mouthfuls
a
great
many
read
newspapers
which
they
had
folded
and
placed
against
their
bottles
others
their
first
hunger
satisfied
talked
noisily
always
returning
to
the
eternal
grievance
of
the
bad
food
to
the
money
they
had
earned
to
what
they
had
done
on
the
previous
sunday
and
what
they
were
going
to
do
on
the
next
one
i
say
what
about
your
robineau
a
salesman
suddenly
asked
hutin
the
struggle
between
the
men
of
the
silk
department
and
their
occupied
all
the
counters
the
question
was
discussed
every
evening
at
the
café
until
midnight
hutin
who
was
busy
with
his
piece
of
beef
contented
himself
with
replying
well
he
come
back
then
suddenly
getting
angry
he
resumed
but
confound
it
i
really
believe
they
given
me
a
slice
of
donkey
become
disgusting
my
word
of
honour
you
need
grumble
said
favier
i
was
flat
enough
to
ask
for
skate
it
putrid
they
were
all
speaking
at
once
some
complaining
and
some
joking
at
a
corner
of
the
table
against
the
wall
sat
deloche
silently
eating
he
was
afflicted
with
a
ravenous
appetite
which
he
had
never
been
able
to
satisfy
and
not
earning
enough
to
afford
any
extras
he
cut
himself
huge
chunks
of
bread
and
bolted
even
the
least
savoury
platefuls
with
a
gormandizing
air
they
all
laughed
at
him
crying
favier
pass
your
skate
to
deloche
he
likes
it
like
that
and
your
meat
hutin
deloche
wants
it
for
his
dessert
the
poor
fellow
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
did
not
even
reply
it
was
his
fault
if
he
was
dying
of
hunger
besides
the
others
might
abuse
the
food
as
much
as
they
liked
they
swallowed
it
all
the
same
but
a
low
whistle
stopped
their
talk
mouret
and
bourdoncle
were
in
the
corridor
for
some
time
the
complaints
had
become
so
frequent
that
the
principals
pretended
to
come
and
judge
the
quality
of
the
food
themselves
they
gave
thirty
sous
a
head
per
day
to
the
chief
cook
who
had
to
pay
for
everything
provisions
coal
gas
and
staff
and
they
displayed
a
naive
astonishment
when
the
food
was
not
good
that
very
morning
even
each
department
had
deputed
a
spokesman
mignot
and
liénard
had
undertaken
to
speak
for
their
comrades
and
so
in
the
sudden
silence
which
fell
all
ears
were
cocked
to
catch
the
conversation
going
on
in
the
next
room
which
mouret
and
bourdoncle
had
just
entered
the
latter
declared
the
beef
excellent
and
mignot
astounded
by
this
quiet
assertion
was
repeating
but
chew
it
and
see
whilst
liénard
attacking
the
skate
gently
remarked
but
it
stinks
sir
mouret
thereupon
launched
into
a
cordial
speech
he
would
do
everything
for
his
employees
welfare
he
was
their
father
and
would
rather
eat
dry
bread
himself
than
see
them
badly
fed
i
promise
you
to
look
into
the
matter
he
said
in
conclusion
raising
his
voice
so
that
they
might
all
hear
it
from
one
end
of
the
passage
to
the
other
the
inquiry
being
finished
the
noise
of
the
knives
and
forks
commenced
once
more
yes
reckon
on
that
and
drink
water
hutin
muttered
ah
they
not
stingy
of
fine
words
you
want
some
promises
there
you
are
but
all
the
while
they
continue
feeding
you
on
old
and
chuck
you
out
like
dogs
the
salesman
who
had
already
questioned
him
thereupon
repeated
you
say
that
robineau
but
a
clatter
of
heavy
drowned
his
voice
the
men
changed
their
plates
themselves
and
the
piles
at
both
ends
were
diminishing
when
a
brought
in
some
large
tin
dishes
hutin
cried
out
baked
rice
this
is
a
finisher
good
for
a
of
gum
said
favier
serving
himself
some
liked
it
but
others
thought
it
too
sticky
those
who
were
plunged
in
the
fiction
of
their
newspaper
not
even
knowing
what
they
were
eating
remained
silent
all
however
mopped
their
foreheads
and
the
narrow
apartment
filled
with
a
ruddy
vapour
whilst
the
shadows
of
the
continually
passed
like
black
bars
over
the
littered
tables
pass
deloche
the
bread
cried
one
of
the
wags
each
one
cut
a
piece
and
then
again
dug
the
knife
into
the
loaf
up
to
the
handle
and
the
bread
still
went
round
who
take
my
rice
for
a
dessert
all
at
once
asked
hutin
and
when
he
had
concluded
his
bargain
with
a
short
thin
young
fellow
he
attempted
to
sell
his
wine
also
but
no
one
would
take
it
as
it
was
known
to
be
detestable
as
i
was
telling
you
robineau
is
back
he
continued
amid
the
of
laughter
and
conversation
that
went
on
oh
his
affair
is
serious
just
fancy
he
has
been
leading
the
saleswomen
astray
yes
and
he
gets
them
cravats
to
make
silence
muttered
favier
they
just
judging
him
and
with
a
wink
he
called
attention
to
bouthemont
who
was
walking
up
and
down
the
passage
between
mouret
and
bourdoncle
all
three
absorbed
in
an
animated
conversation
carried
on
in
a
low
tone
the
of
the
managers
and
happened
to
be
just
opposite
and
so
on
seeing
mouret
pass
bouthemont
having
finished
his
meal
had
got
up
to
relate
the
affair
and
explain
the
awkward
position
he
was
in
the
other
two
listened
still
refusing
to
sacrifice
robineau
a
salesman
who
dated
from
madame
hédouin
time
but
when
bouthemont
came
to
the
story
of
the
neckties
bourdoncle
got
angry
was
this
fellow
mad
to
interfere
with
the
saleswomen
and
procure
them
extra
work
the
house
paid
dearly
enough
for
the
women
time
if
they
worked
on
their
own
account
at
night
they
must
work
less
during
the
daytime
in
the
shop
that
was
certain
therefore
it
was
a
robbery
they
were
risking
their
health
which
did
not
belong
to
them
no
the
night
was
intended
for
sleep
they
must
all
sleep
or
they
would
be
sent
to
the
things
are
getting
rather
warm
remarked
hutin
each
time
the
three
principals
passed
the
the
shopmen
watched
them
commenting
on
their
slightest
gestures
the
baked
rice
in
which
a
cashier
had
just
found
a
was
momentarily
forgotten
i
just
heard
the
word
said
favier
and
you
saw
how
bourdoncle
face
turned
pale
all
at
once
mouret
shared
his
partner
indignation
that
a
saleswoman
should
be
reduced
to
work
at
night
seemed
to
him
an
attack
on
the
very
organization
of
the
ladies
paradise
who
was
the
stupid
that
earn
enough
in
the
business
but
when
bouthemont
named
denise
he
softened
down
and
invented
excuses
ah
yes
that
poor
little
girl
she
was
very
sharp
and
had
others
dependent
on
her
it
was
said
bourdoncle
interrupted
him
to
declare
they
ought
to
send
her
packing
immediately
they
would
never
do
anything
with
such
an
ugly
creature
he
had
always
said
so
and
he
seemed
to
be
indulging
a
spiteful
feeling
thereupon
mouret
in
embarrassment
affected
to
laugh
dear
me
what
a
severe
man
could
they
forgive
her
for
once
they
could
call
in
the
culprit
and
give
her
a
scolding
in
short
robineau
was
the
one
to
blame
for
he
ought
to
have
dissuaded
her
he
an
old
hand
knowing
the
ways
of
the
house
well
there
the
governor
laughing
now
resumed
favier
in
astonishment
as
the
group
again
passed
the
door
ah
by
jove
exclaimed
hutin
if
they
persist
in
shoving
robineau
on
our
shoulders
we
make
it
lively
for
them
bourdoncle
looked
straight
at
mouret
and
then
simply
made
a
gesture
of
disdain
to
intimate
that
he
saw
how
it
was
and
thought
it
idiotic
bouthemont
meantime
resumed
his
complaints
the
salesmen
threatened
to
leave
and
there
were
some
very
good
men
amongst
them
however
what
appeared
to
have
most
effect
on
these
gentlemen
was
the
rumour
of
robineau
friendly
relations
with
gaujean
the
latter
it
was
said
was
urging
the
former
to
set
up
for
himself
in
the
neighbourhood
offering
him
any
amount
of
credit
to
run
in
opposition
to
the
paradise
there
was
a
pause
ah
robineau
thought
of
showing
fight
did
he
mouret
had
become
serious
though
he
affected
a
certain
scorn
and
avoided
coming
to
a
decision
as
if
it
were
matter
of
no
importance
they
would
see
they
would
speak
to
him
and
he
immediately
began
to
joke
with
bouthemont
whose
father
arriving
from
his
little
shop
at
montpellier
two
days
previously
had
almost
choked
with
stupefaction
and
rage
on
seeing
the
immense
hall
in
which
his
son
reigned
everyone
was
still
laughing
about
the
old
man
who
recovering
his
southern
assurance
had
immediately
begun
to
run
everything
down
pretending
that
the
drapery
business
would
soon
go
to
the
dogs
ah
precisely
here
robineau
said
bouthemont
i
sent
him
to
attend
to
some
matching
so
as
to
avoid
any
unpleasant
occurrence
excuse
me
if
i
insist
but
things
have
come
to
such
a
pass
that
something
must
really
be
done
robineau
who
had
just
come
in
passed
by
the
group
with
a
bow
on
his
way
to
the
table
mouret
simply
repeated
all
right
we
see
about
it
then
all
three
went
off
hutin
and
favier
were
still
watching
for
them
but
on
seeing
that
they
did
not
return
began
to
relieve
their
feelings
did
the
governor
mean
to
come
down
like
that
at
every
meal
to
count
their
mouthfuls
a
nice
thing
it
would
be
if
they
could
not
even
eat
in
peace
the
truth
was
they
had
just
seen
robineau
come
in
and
the
governor
made
them
anxious
about
the
result
of
the
struggle
they
were
engaged
in
they
lowered
their
voices
trying
to
find
fresh
subjects
for
grumbling
but
i
dying
of
hunger
continued
hutin
aloud
one
is
hungrier
than
ever
on
rising
from
table
and
yet
he
had
eaten
two
portions
of
jam
his
own
and
the
one
which
he
had
secured
in
exchange
for
his
plate
of
rice
all
at
once
he
cried
out
hang
it
i
going
in
for
an
extra
victor
give
me
another
jam
the
waiter
was
finishing
the
serving
of
the
desserts
he
then
brought
in
the
coffee
and
those
who
took
it
gave
him
their
three
sous
there
and
then
a
few
had
gone
away
dawdling
along
the
corridor
and
looking
for
a
dark
corner
where
they
might
smoke
a
cigarette
the
others
remained
at
table
before
the
greasy
plates
rolling
pellets
of
and
recounting
the
same
old
stories
amidst
the
sickly
odour
of
victuals
which
they
could
no
longer
smell
and
the
sweltering
heat
which
was
reddening
their
ears
the
walls
reeked
with
moisture
a
slow
asphyxia
fell
from
the
mouldy
vaulted
ceiling
leaning
against
the
wall
was
deloche
stuffed
with
bread
and
digesting
in
silence
his
eyes
on
the
window
his
daily
recreation
after
luncheon
was
to
watch
the
feet
of
the
spinning
along
the
street
a
continual
procession
of
living
feet
in
big
shoes
elegant
boots
and
ladies
tiny
boots
without
either
head
or
body
on
rainy
days
all
were
very
dirty
what
already
suddenly
exclaimed
hutin
a
bell
had
begun
to
ring
at
the
end
of
the
passage
and
they
had
to
make
way
for
the
third
lunch
the
waiters
came
in
with
pails
of
warm
water
and
big
sponges
to
clean
the
american
cloth
gradually
the
rooms
emptied
and
the
salesmen
returned
to
their
departments
loitering
as
they
went
up
the
stairs
in
the
kitchen
the
head
cook
had
resumed
his
place
at
the
wicket
between
the
pans
of
skate
beef
and
sauce
again
armed
with
his
forks
and
spoons
and
ready
to
fill
the
plates
anew
with
the
rhythmical
movement
of
a
clock
as
hutin
and
favier
slowly
withdrew
they
saw
denise
coming
down
monsieur
robineau
is
back
mademoiselle
said
the
former
with
sneering
politeness
he
is
still
at
table
added
the
other
but
if
you
are
in
a
very
great
hurry
you
can
go
in
denise
continued
on
her
way
without
replying
or
turning
round
but
when
she
passed
the
of
the
managers
and
she
could
not
help
just
looking
in
and
saw
that
robineau
was
really
there
she
resolved
that
she
would
try
to
speak
to
him
in
the
afternoon
and
continued
her
journey
along
the
corridor
to
her
own
which
was
at
the
other
end
the
women
took
their
meals
apart
in
two
special
rooms
denise
entered
the
first
one
this
also
was
an
old
cellar
transformed
into
a
refectory
but
it
had
been
fitted
up
with
more
comfort
on
the
oval
table
in
the
middle
of
the
apartment
the
fifteen
places
were
set
further
apart
and
the
wine
was
in
decanters
a
dish
of
skate
and
a
dish
of
beef
with
pungent
sauce
occupying
the
two
ends
of
the
table
waiters
in
white
aprons
moreover
attended
to
the
young
ladies
and
spared
them
the
trouble
of
fetching
their
portions
from
the
wicket
the
manager
had
thought
this
arrangement
more
seemly
you
went
round
then
asked
pauline
already
seated
and
cutting
herself
some
bread
yes
replied
denise
blushing
i
was
accompanying
a
customer
but
this
was
a
fib
clara
nudged
her
neighbour
what
was
the
matter
with
the
unkempt
girl
she
was
quite
strange
in
her
ways
that
day
one
after
the
other
she
had
received
two
letters
from
her
lover
and
then
went
running
all
over
the
shop
like
a
madwoman
pretending
she
was
going
to
the
where
she
did
not
even
put
in
an
appearance
there
was
something
up
that
was
certain
then
clara
eating
her
skate
without
any
show
of
disgust
with
the
indifference
of
a
girl
who
had
been
used
to
nothing
better
than
rancid
bacon
began
speaking
of
a
frightful
drama
accounts
of
which
filled
the
newspapers
you
read
about
that
man
cutting
his
mistress
throat
with
a
razor
have
you
well
said
a
little
quiet
girl
belonging
to
the
department
she
was
unfaithful
to
him
serve
her
right
but
pauline
protested
what
just
because
you
had
ceased
to
love
a
man
he
was
to
be
allowed
to
cut
your
throat
ah
no
never
and
stopping
all
at
once
she
turned
round
to
the
waiter
saying
pierre
i
get
through
this
beef
just
tell
them
to
do
me
an
extra
an
omelet
nice
and
soft
if
possible
then
to
while
away
the
time
she
took
out
some
chocolate
which
she
began
eating
with
her
bread
for
she
always
had
her
pockets
full
of
sweetmeats
it
certainly
is
very
amusing
resumed
clara
and
some
people
are
fearfully
jealous
you
know
only
the
other
day
there
was
a
workman
who
pitched
his
wife
into
a
well
she
kept
her
eyes
on
denise
thinking
she
had
guessed
her
trouble
on
seeing
her
turn
pale
evidently
that
little
prude
was
afraid
of
being
beaten
by
her
lover
whom
she
no
doubt
deceived
it
would
be
a
lark
if
he
should
come
into
the
shop
after
her
as
she
seemed
to
fear
he
would
but
the
conversation
took
another
turn
for
one
of
the
girls
was
giving
a
recipe
for
cleaning
velvet
then
they
went
on
to
speak
of
a
piece
at
the
gaiety
in
which
some
lovely
little
children
danced
better
than
any
persons
pauline
saddened
for
a
moment
at
the
sight
of
her
omelet
which
was
overdone
recovered
her
spirits
on
finding
that
it
tasted
fairly
well
pass
the
wine
said
she
to
denise
you
should
take
an
omelet
oh
the
beef
is
enough
for
me
replied
the
young
girl
who
in
order
to
avoid
expense
contented
herself
with
the
food
provided
by
the
house
no
matter
how
repugnant
it
might
be
when
the
waiter
brought
in
the
baked
rice
the
other
young
ladies
protested
they
had
refused
it
the
previous
week
and
had
hoped
it
would
not
appear
again
denise
inattentive
worrying
the
more
about
jean
after
clara
stories
was
the
only
one
to
eat
it
and
all
the
others
looked
at
her
with
disgust
there
was
a
great
demand
for
extras
they
gorged
themselves
with
jam
moreover
this
was
a
sort
of
elegance
they
considered
it
aristocratic
to
feed
themselves
at
their
own
expense
you
know
that
the
gentlemen
have
complained
said
the
delicate
little
girl
from
the
department
and
the
management
has
promised
but
the
others
interrupted
her
with
a
burst
of
laughter
and
began
to
rail
at
the
management
coffee
was
taken
by
all
excepting
denise
who
could
bear
it
she
said
and
they
lingered
there
before
their
cups
the
young
ladies
from
the
department
all
simplicity
in
their
woollen
dresses
and
the
young
ladies
from
the
mantle
department
arrayed
in
silk
their
napkins
tucked
under
their
chins
in
order
not
to
stain
their
gowns
like
ladies
who
might
have
come
down
to
the
servants
hall
to
dine
with
their
having
opened
the
glazed
sash
of
the
to
change
the
stifling
poisoned
air
they
were
speedily
obliged
to
close
it
for
the
seemed
to
be
passing
over
the
table
hush
whispered
pauline
here
that
old
beast
it
was
inspector
jouve
who
was
rather
fond
of
prowling
about
at
meal
times
when
the
young
ladies
were
there
he
was
supposed
in
fact
to
look
after
their
with
a
smiling
face
he
would
come
in
and
walk
round
the
tables
sometimes
he
would
even
indulge
in
a
little
gossip
and
inquire
if
they
had
made
a
good
lunch
but
as
he
annoyed
them
and
made
them
feel
uncomfortable
they
all
hastened
to
get
away
although
the
bell
had
not
rung
clara
was
the
first
to
disappear
the
others
followed
her
and
soon
only
denise
and
pauline
remained
the
latter
after
drinking
her
coffee
was
finishing
her
chocolate
drops
but
all
at
once
she
got
up
saying
i
going
to
send
a
messenger
for
some
oranges
are
you
coming
presently
replied
denise
who
was
nibbling
at
a
crust
determined
to
wait
till
the
last
so
that
she
might
be
able
to
see
robineau
on
her
way
upstairs
however
when
she
found
herself
alone
with
jouve
she
felt
uneasy
and
annoyed
and
quitted
the
table
but
as
she
was
going
towards
the
door
he
stopped
her
saying
mademoiselle
baudu
erect
before
her
he
was
smiling
with
a
paternal
air
his
thick
grey
moustache
and
short
cropped
hair
gave
him
a
respectable
military
appearance
and
he
threw
out
his
chest
on
which
was
displayed
the
red
ribbon
of
his
decoration
what
is
it
monsieur
jouve
asked
she
feeling
reassured
i
caught
you
again
this
morning
talking
upstairs
behind
the
carpet
department
you
know
it
is
not
allowed
and
if
i
reported
you
she
must
be
very
fond
of
you
your
friend
pauline
his
moustache
quivered
and
his
huge
nose
seemed
all
aflame
what
makes
you
so
fond
of
each
other
eh
denise
had
again
been
seized
with
an
uneasy
feeling
he
was
getting
too
close
and
was
speaking
in
her
face
it
true
we
were
talking
monsieur
jouve
she
stammered
but
there
no
harm
in
talking
a
bit
you
are
very
kind
to
me
and
i
very
much
obliged
to
you
i
ought
not
to
be
kind
said
he
justice
and
nothing
more
is
my
motto
but
when
it
a
pretty
girl
and
thereupon
he
came
closer
still
and
she
felt
really
afraid
pauline
words
returned
to
her
memory
and
she
recalled
the
stories
which
were
told
of
old
jouve
leave
me
alone
she
murmured
drawing
back
come
said
he
you
are
not
going
to
play
the
savage
with
me
who
always
treat
you
so
well
be
amiable
come
and
take
a
cup
of
tea
and
a
slice
of
with
me
this
evening
you
are
very
welcome
she
was
struggling
now
no
no
she
exclaimed
the
remained
empty
the
waiter
had
not
come
back
jouve
listening
for
the
sound
of
any
footsteps
cast
a
rapid
glance
around
him
and
then
very
excited
losing
all
control
over
himself
he
attempted
to
kiss
her
on
the
neck
what
a
spiteful
stupid
little
girl
you
are
he
said
but
she
was
quite
shocked
and
terrified
by
the
approach
of
his
burning
face
and
all
at
once
she
gave
him
so
rough
a
push
that
he
staggered
and
nearly
fell
upon
the
table
fortunately
a
chair
saved
him
but
in
the
shock
some
wine
left
in
a
glass
spurted
on
to
his
white
necktie
and
soaked
his
decoration
and
he
remained
there
without
wiping
himself
choked
with
anger
at
such
brutality
ah
you
will
be
sorry
for
this
on
my
word
of
honour
he
growled
between
his
teeth
denise
ran
away
just
at
that
moment
the
bell
rang
but
sorely
perturbed
still
shuddering
she
forgot
robineau
and
went
straight
up
to
her
counter
and
she
did
not
dare
to
go
down
again
as
the
sun
fell
on
the
frontage
of
the
place
gaillon
of
an
afternoon
they
were
soon
all
stifling
in
the
rooms
notwithstanding
the
grey
linen
blinds
a
few
customers
came
put
the
young
ladies
into
perspiration
and
went
away
without
buying
anything
every
one
was
yawning
even
under
madame
aurélie
big
sleepy
eyes
at
last
towards
three
denise
seeing
the
falling
asleep
quietly
slipped
off
and
resumed
her
journey
across
the
shop
with
a
busy
air
to
put
the
curious
ones
who
might
be
watching
her
off
the
scent
she
did
not
go
straight
to
the
silk
department
pretending
that
she
wanted
something
among
the
laces
she
went
up
to
deloche
and
asked
him
a
question
and
then
on
reaching
the
she
passed
through
the
printed
cottons
department
and
was
just
going
into
the
cravat
gallery
when
she
stopped
short
startled
and
surprised
jean
was
before
her
what
it
you
she
murmured
quite
pale
he
was
wearing
his
working
blouse
and
was
with
his
hair
in
disorder
its
curls
falling
over
his
girlish
face
standing
before
a
of
narrow
black
neckties
he
appeared
to
be
thinking
deeply
what
are
you
doing
here
resumed
denise
what
do
you
think
replied
he
i
was
waiting
for
you
you
let
me
come
so
i
came
in
all
the
same
but
have
said
anything
to
anybody
you
may
be
quite
easy
pretend
not
to
know
me
if
you
like
some
salesmen
were
already
looking
at
them
in
astonishment
jean
lowered
his
voice
she
wanted
to
come
with
me
you
know
yes
she
is
close
by
opposite
the
fountain
give
me
the
fifteen
francs
quick
or
we
are
done
for
as
sure
as
the
sun
is
shining
on
us
denise
then
lost
her
head
the
were
grinning
listening
to
this
adventure
and
as
behind
the
cravat
department
there
was
a
staircase
leading
to
the
basement
she
hastily
pushed
her
brother
and
made
him
go
down
once
below
he
resumed
his
story
embarrassed
inventing
his
facts
as
he
went
on
and
fearing
that
he
might
not
be
believed
the
money
is
not
for
her
she
is
too
respectable
for
that
and
as
for
her
husband
he
does
not
care
a
straw
for
fifteen
francs
no
it
for
a
low
fellow
one
of
her
friends
who
saw
me
kissing
her
and
if
i
do
give
him
this
money
this
evening
be
quiet
murmured
denise
presently
do
get
along
they
were
now
in
the
parcels
office
the
dead
season
had
steeped
the
vast
basement
in
a
sort
of
torpor
in
the
pale
light
falling
from
the
it
was
cool
as
well
and
a
silence
fell
from
the
ceiling
however
there
was
a
porter
collecting
from
one
of
the
compartments
a
few
parcels
for
the
neighbourhood
of
the
madeleine
and
on
the
large
sat
campion
the
chief
clerk
his
legs
dangling
and
his
eyes
wandering
jean
began
again
the
husband
who
has
a
big
knife
get
along
repeated
denise
still
pushing
him
forward
they
followed
one
of
the
narrow
passages
where
the
gas
was
always
kept
burning
in
the
dark
vaults
to
the
right
and
the
left
were
the
reserve
goods
shadowy
behind
the
gratings
at
last
she
stopped
opposite
one
of
these
nobody
was
likely
to
pass
that
way
but
the
assistants
were
not
allowed
there
and
she
shuddered
if
this
rascal
says
anything
resumed
jean
the
husband
who
has
a
big
knife
but
where
do
you
expect
me
to
find
fifteen
francs
exclaimed
denise
in
despair
ca
you
be
more
careful
you
always
getting
into
some
stupid
scrape
he
struck
his
chest
amidst
all
his
romantic
inventions
he
had
almost
forgotten
the
exact
truth
he
dramatized
his
pecuniary
wants
but
there
was
always
some
immediate
necessity
behind
his
display
by
all
sacred
it
really
true
this
time
said
he
she
stopped
him
again
and
lost
her
temper
tortured
and
completely
at
a
loss
i
do
want
to
know
she
replied
keep
your
wicked
conduct
to
yourself
it
too
bad
you
ought
to
know
better
you
always
tormenting
me
i
killing
myself
to
keep
you
in
money
yes
i
have
to
stay
up
all
night
at
work
not
only
that
but
you
are
taking
the
bread
out
of
your
little
brother
mouth
jean
stood
there
with
his
mouth
agape
and
his
face
paling
what
it
was
wicked
and
he
could
not
understand
from
infancy
he
had
always
treated
his
sister
like
a
comrade
and
thought
it
quite
a
natural
thing
to
open
his
heart
to
her
but
what
upset
him
above
all
else
was
to
learn
that
she
stopped
up
all
night
the
idea
that
he
was
killing
her
and
taking
pépé
share
as
well
affected
him
so
much
that
he
began
to
cry
you
right
i
a
scamp
he
exclaimed
really
now
i
am
quite
furious
with
myself
i
could
slap
my
face
he
had
taken
her
hands
and
was
kissing
them
and
inundating
them
with
tears
give
me
the
fifteen
francs
and
this
shall
be
the
last
time
i
swear
it
to
you
or
rather
no
do
give
me
anything
i
prefer
to
die
if
the
husband
murders
me
it
will
be
a
good
riddance
for
you
and
as
she
was
now
crying
as
well
he
became
stricken
with
remorse
i
say
that
but
of
course
i
not
sure
perhaps
he
does
want
to
kill
any
one
manage
i
promise
you
that
little
sister
i
off
however
a
sound
of
footsteps
at
the
end
of
the
passage
suddenly
frightened
them
she
quickly
drew
him
close
to
the
grating
in
a
dark
corner
for
an
instant
they
heard
nothing
but
the
hissing
of
a
near
them
then
the
footsteps
drew
nearer
and
on
stretching
out
her
neck
she
recognised
inspector
jouve
who
had
just
entered
the
corridor
with
his
stiff
military
walk
was
he
there
by
chance
or
had
some
one
at
the
door
warned
him
of
jean
presence
she
was
seized
with
such
fright
that
she
quite
lost
her
head
and
pushing
jean
out
of
the
dark
spot
where
they
were
concealed
drove
him
before
her
stammering
out
be
off
be
off
both
galloped
along
hearing
jouve
behind
them
for
he
also
had
began
to
run
and
again
they
crossed
the
parcels
office
and
reached
the
foot
of
the
stairs
leading
out
into
the
rue
de
la
michodière
be
off
repeated
denise
be
off
if
i
can
i
send
you
the
fifteen
francs
all
the
same
jean
bewildered
scampered
away
the
inspector
who
came
up
panting
out
of
breath
could
only
distinguish
a
corner
of
his
white
blouse
and
his
locks
of
fair
hair
flying
in
the
wind
for
a
moment
jouve
remained
trying
to
get
his
breath
back
and
resume
his
dignified
demeanour
he
now
wore
a
white
necktie
which
he
had
purchased
in
the
linen
department
and
the
large
bow
of
which
glistened
like
snow
well
this
is
nice
behaviour
mademoiselle
said
he
his
lips
trembling
yes
it
nice
very
nice
if
you
think
i
going
to
stand
this
sort
of
thing
you
mistaken
and
with
this
remark
he
pursued
her
whilst
she
was
returning
to
the
shop
overcome
with
emotion
and
unable
to
find
a
word
of
defence
she
was
sorry
now
that
she
had
run
away
why
had
she
explained
the
matter
and
brought
her
brother
forward
they
would
now
imagine
all
sorts
of
villanies
and
say
what
she
might
they
would
never
believe
her
once
more
she
forgot
robineau
and
went
back
to
her
counter
while
jouve
repaired
to
the
manager
office
to
report
the
matter
but
the
messenger
on
duty
told
him
that
monsieur
mouret
was
with
monsieur
bourdoncle
and
monsieur
robineau
they
had
been
talking
together
for
the
last
quarter
of
an
hour
in
fact
the
door
was
and
he
could
hear
mouret
gaily
asking
robineau
if
he
had
spent
a
pleasant
holiday
there
was
not
the
least
question
of
a
dismissal
on
the
contrary
the
conversation
fell
on
certain
things
to
be
done
in
the
silk
department
do
you
want
anything
monsieur
jouve
exclaimed
mouret
come
in
but
a
sudden
instinct
warned
the
inspector
as
bourdoncle
had
come
out
he
preferred
to
relate
everything
to
him
and
they
slowly
passed
through
the
shawl
department
walking
side
by
side
the
one
leaning
over
and
talking
in
a
low
tone
the
other
listening
without
a
muscle
of
his
severe
face
betraying
his
impressions
all
right
he
said
at
last
and
as
they
had
arrived
at
the
mantle
department
he
went
in
just
at
that
moment
madame
aurélie
was
scolding
denise
where
had
she
come
from
again
this
time
she
could
say
that
she
had
been
to
the
really
these
continual
absences
could
not
be
tolerated
any
longer
madame
aurélie
cried
bourdoncle
he
had
decided
on
a
bold
stroke
not
wishing
to
consult
mouret
for
fear
of
some
weakness
the
came
up
and
the
story
was
once
more
related
in
a
low
voice
all
the
girls
were
waiting
in
the
expectation
of
some
catastrophe
at
last
madame
aurélie
turned
round
with
a
solemn
air
mademoiselle
baudu
she
called
and
her
puffy
cæsarian
countenance
assumed
the
inexorable
sternness
of
sovereign
power
go
and
get
paid
the
terrible
phrase
rang
out
loudly
in
the
empty
department
denise
stood
there
pale
as
a
ghost
without
saying
a
word
at
last
she
was
able
to
ask
in
broken
sentences
me
me
what
for
what
have
i
done
bourdoncle
harshly
replied
that
she
knew
very
well
that
she
had
better
not
provoke
any
explanation
and
he
spoke
of
the
cravats
and
added
that
it
would
be
a
fine
thing
if
all
the
young
ladies
were
to
receive
men
down
in
the
basement
but
it
was
my
brother
she
cried
with
the
grievous
anger
of
an
outraged
virgin
marguerite
and
clara
began
to
laugh
madame
frédéric
usually
so
discreet
shook
her
head
with
an
incredulous
air
always
her
brother
really
it
was
very
stupid
denise
looked
round
at
all
of
them
at
bourdoncle
who
had
taken
a
dislike
to
her
from
the
first
jouve
who
had
stopped
to
serve
as
a
witness
and
from
whom
she
expected
no
justice
and
then
at
those
girls
whom
she
had
not
been
able
to
soften
by
nine
months
of
smiling
courage
who
were
happy
in
fact
to
help
in
turning
her
out
of
doors
what
was
the
use
of
struggling
what
was
the
use
of
trying
to
impose
herself
on
them
when
none
of
them
liked
her
and
she
went
away
without
a
word
not
even
casting
another
look
at
the
room
where
she
had
so
long
battled
but
as
soon
as
she
was
alone
before
the
hall
staircase
a
deeper
sense
of
suffering
filled
her
heart
no
one
cared
for
her
and
the
sudden
thought
of
mouret
had
just
deprived
her
of
all
resignation
no
no
she
could
not
accept
such
a
dismissal
perhaps
he
would
believe
that
villanous
story
of
a
rendezvous
with
a
man
down
in
the
cellars
at
this
thought
a
feeling
of
shame
tortured
her
an
anguish
with
which
she
had
never
before
been
afflicted
she
wished
to
go
and
see
him
to
explain
the
matter
to
him
simply
in
order
to
let
him
know
the
truth
for
she
was
quite
ready
to
go
away
as
soon
as
he
should
know
it
and
her
old
fear
the
shiver
which
chilled
her
whenever
she
was
in
his
presence
suddenly
developed
into
an
ardent
desire
to
see
him
not
to
leave
the
house
in
fact
without
telling
him
that
she
had
never
belonged
to
another
it
was
nearly
five
and
the
shop
was
waking
into
life
again
in
the
cool
evening
air
she
quickly
started
off
for
mouret
office
but
when
she
reached
the
door
a
hopeless
melancholy
feeling
again
took
possession
of
her
her
tongue
refused
its
office
the
intolerable
burden
of
existence
again
fell
on
her
shoulders
he
would
not
believe
her
he
would
laugh
like
the
others
she
thought
and
this
idea
made
her
almost
faint
away
all
was
over
she
would
be
better
alone
out
of
the
way
dead
and
thereupon
without
informing
either
pauline
or
deloche
she
at
once
went
for
her
money
you
have
days
mademoiselle
said
the
clerk
that
makes
eighteen
francs
and
fourteen
sous
to
which
must
be
added
seven
francs
for
commission
that
right
is
it
yes
sir
thanks
and
denise
was
about
to
go
off
with
her
money
when
she
at
last
met
robineau
he
had
already
heard
of
her
dismissal
and
promised
to
find
the
then
in
a
lower
tone
he
tried
to
console
her
but
lost
his
temper
what
an
existence
to
be
at
the
continual
mercy
of
a
whim
to
be
thrown
on
to
the
pavement
at
an
hour
notice
without
even
being
able
to
claim
a
full
month
salary
denise
went
up
to
inform
madame
cabin
that
she
would
endeavour
to
send
for
her
box
during
the
evening
it
was
just
striking
five
when
she
found
herself
on
the
pavement
of
the
place
gaillon
bewildered
in
the
midst
of
the
crowd
of
people
and
vehicles
that
same
evening
when
robineau
got
home
he
received
a
letter
from
the
management
informing
him
in
a
few
lines
that
for
certain
reasons
relating
to
internal
arrangements
they
were
obliged
to
deprive
themselves
of
his
services
he
had
been
at
the
paradise
for
seven
years
and
only
that
afternoon
had
been
talking
to
the
principals
thus
it
was
a
heavy
blow
for
him
hutin
and
favier
however
were
crowing
in
the
silk
department
as
loudly
as
clara
and
marguerite
in
the
other
one
a
jolly
good
riddance
such
clean
sweeps
made
room
for
others
deloche
and
pauline
were
the
only
ones
who
when
they
met
amidst
the
crush
of
the
galleries
exchanged
distressful
words
in
their
regret
at
the
departure
of
denise
so
virtuous
and
gentle
ah
said
the
young
man
if
ever
she
succeeds
anywhere
else
i
should
like
to
see
her
come
back
here
and
trample
on
all
those
creatures
it
was
bourdoncle
who
in
this
affair
had
to
bear
the
brunt
of
anger
when
the
latter
heard
of
denise
dismissal
he
was
exceedingly
annoyed
as
a
rule
he
never
interfered
with
the
staff
but
this
time
he
affected
to
see
an
encroachment
on
his
attributions
an
attempt
to
his
authority
was
he
no
longer
master
in
the
place
that
they
dared
to
give
orders
everything
must
pass
through
his
hands
absolutely
everything
and
he
would
immediately
crush
any
one
who
should
resist
then
after
making
personal
inquiries
all
the
while
in
a
nervous
torment
which
he
could
not
conceal
he
again
lost
his
temper
the
poor
girl
had
not
lied
it
was
really
her
brother
campion
had
fully
recognised
him
why
had
she
been
sent
away
then
he
even
spoke
of
taking
her
back
however
bourdoncle
strong
is
his
passive
resistance
bent
before
the
storm
he
studied
mouret
and
one
day
when
he
saw
him
a
little
calmer
he
ventured
to
say
in
a
meaning
voice
it
better
for
everybody
that
she
gone
mouret
stood
there
looking
very
awkward
the
blood
rushing
to
his
face
well
he
replied
laughing
perhaps
you
right
let
go
and
take
a
turn
downstairs
things
are
looking
better
the
receipts
rose
to
nearly
a
hundred
thousand
francs
yesterday
chapter
vii
for
a
moment
denise
stood
bewildered
on
the
pavement
in
the
sun
which
still
shone
fiercely
at
five
the
july
heat
warmed
the
gutters
paris
was
blazing
with
that
white
chalky
light
of
whose
reverberations
are
so
blinding
and
the
catastrophe
had
fallen
on
her
so
suddenly
they
had
turned
her
out
so
roughly
that
she
stood
there
turning
her
money
over
in
her
pocket
in
a
mechanical
way
while
she
wondered
where
she
could
go
and
what
she
could
do
a
long
line
of
cabs
prevented
her
from
quitting
the
pavement
alongside
the
ladies
paradise
when
she
at
last
ventured
amongst
the
wheels
she
crossed
the
place
gaillon
as
if
intending
to
take
the
rue
then
altering
her
mind
she
walked
towards
the
rue
but
she
still
had
no
plan
for
she
stopped
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
into
which
she
finally
turned
after
looking
around
her
with
an
undecided
air
the
passage
choiseul
opening
before
her
she
passed
through
it
and
found
herself
in
the
rue
monsigny
without
knowing
how
and
ultimately
came
into
the
rue
again
her
head
was
full
of
a
fearful
buzzing
she
thought
of
her
box
on
seeing
a
commissionaire
but
where
could
she
have
it
sent
and
why
all
this
trouble
when
but
an
hour
ago
she
had
still
had
a
bed
in
which
to
sleep
that
night
then
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
houses
she
began
examining
the
windows
there
were
any
number
of
bills
announcing
apartments
to
let
but
repeatedly
overcome
by
the
emotion
which
was
agitating
her
whole
being
she
saw
them
confusedly
was
it
possible
thrown
into
solitude
so
suddenly
lost
in
this
immense
city
in
which
she
was
a
stranger
without
support
without
resources
she
must
contrive
to
eat
and
sleep
however
the
streets
succeeded
one
another
after
the
rue
des
moulins
came
the
rue
she
wandered
about
the
neighbourhood
frequently
retracing
her
steps
indeed
always
coming
back
to
the
only
spot
she
knew
really
well
and
suddenly
she
felt
quite
astonished
for
she
was
again
standing
before
the
ladies
paradise
to
escape
this
obsession
she
hurried
into
the
rue
de
la
michodière
fortunately
baudu
was
not
at
his
door
the
old
elbeuf
appeared
lifeless
behind
its
murky
windows
she
would
never
have
dared
to
show
herself
at
her
uncle
for
he
now
always
pretended
not
to
recognise
her
and
she
did
not
wish
to
become
a
burden
to
him
in
the
misfortune
which
he
had
predicted
to
her
however
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
a
yellow
bill
attracted
her
attention
furnished
room
to
let
it
was
the
first
that
did
not
frighten
her
so
poor
was
the
aspect
of
the
house
she
soon
recognised
it
with
its
two
low
storeys
and
front
squeezed
between
the
ladies
paradise
and
the
old
hôtel
duvillard
on
the
threshold
of
the
umbrella
shop
old
bourras
hairy
and
bearded
like
a
prophet
and
with
spectacles
on
his
nose
stood
studying
the
ivory
handle
of
a
tenanting
the
whole
house
he
the
two
upper
floors
furnished
in
order
to
lighten
the
rent
you
have
a
room
to
let
sir
said
denise
approaching
him
in
obedience
to
an
instinctive
impulse
he
raised
his
big
bushy
eyes
surprised
to
see
her
for
he
knew
all
the
young
persons
at
the
ladies
paradise
and
after
noticing
her
clean
little
gown
and
respectable
appearance
he
replied
it
wo
suit
you
how
much
is
it
then
replied
denise
fifteen
francs
a
month
she
asked
to
see
it
then
on
entering
the
narrow
shop
and
observing
that
he
still
eyed
her
with
an
astonished
air
she
told
him
of
her
departure
from
the
paradise
and
of
her
desire
not
to
trouble
her
uncle
the
old
man
thereupon
fetched
a
key
from
a
shelf
in
the
a
small
dark
room
where
he
did
his
cooking
and
had
his
bed
beyond
it
through
a
dirty
window
you
could
espy
a
about
six
feet
square
i
walk
in
front
to
prevent
you
from
falling
said
bourras
entering
the
damp
corridor
on
one
side
of
the
shop
he
stumbled
against
a
stair
and
then
commenced
the
ascent
reiterating
his
warning
to
be
careful
the
rail
said
he
was
close
against
the
wall
there
was
a
hole
at
the
corner
sometimes
the
lodgers
left
their
there
so
complete
was
the
obscurity
that
denise
could
distinguish
nothing
but
simply
felt
how
chilly
the
old
damp
plaster
was
on
the
first
floor
however
a
small
window
overlooking
the
yard
enabled
her
to
obtain
a
vague
glimpse
of
the
rotten
staircase
the
walls
black
with
dirt
and
the
cracked
discoloured
doors
if
only
one
of
these
rooms
were
vacant
resumed
bourras
you
would
be
very
comfortable
there
but
they
are
always
occupied
on
the
second
floor
the
light
increased
illumining
with
a
raw
pallor
the
distressful
aspect
of
the
house
a
occupied
the
first
room
and
it
was
the
other
the
further
one
that
was
vacant
when
bourras
had
opened
the
door
he
was
obliged
to
remain
on
the
landing
in
order
that
denise
might
enter
with
ease
the
bed
placed
in
the
corner
nearest
the
door
left
just
sufficient
room
for
one
person
to
pass
at
the
other
end
there
was
a
small
chest
of
drawers
a
deal
table
stained
black
and
two
chairs
such
lodgers
as
did
any
cooking
were
obliged
to
kneel
before
the
where
there
was
an
earthenware
stove
oh
it
not
luxurious
said
the
old
man
but
the
view
from
the
window
is
gay
you
can
see
the
people
passing
in
the
street
and
as
denise
gazed
with
surprise
at
the
ceiling
just
above
the
bed
where
a
chance
had
written
her
name
ernestine
by
drawing
the
flame
of
a
candle
over
the
plaster
he
added
with
a
smile
if
i
did
a
lot
of
repairs
i
should
never
make
both
ends
meet
there
you
are
all
i
have
to
offer
i
shall
be
very
well
here
declared
the
young
girl
she
paid
a
month
in
advance
asked
for
the
linen
a
pair
of
sheets
and
two
towels
and
made
her
bed
without
delay
happy
and
relieved
to
know
where
she
would
sleep
that
night
an
hour
later
she
had
sent
a
commissionaire
to
fetch
her
box
and
was
quite
at
home
during
the
first
two
months
she
had
a
terribly
hard
time
of
it
being
unable
to
pay
for
pépé
board
she
had
taken
him
away
and
slept
him
on
an
old
couch
lent
by
bourras
she
could
not
do
with
less
than
thirty
sous
a
day
including
the
rent
even
by
living
on
dry
bread
herself
in
order
to
procure
a
bit
of
meat
for
the
little
one
during
the
first
fortnight
she
got
on
fairly
well
having
begun
her
housekeeping
with
about
ten
francs
and
then
too
she
was
fortunate
enough
to
find
the
who
paid
her
the
eighteen
francs
six
sous
which
were
due
to
her
but
after
that
she
became
completely
destitute
in
vain
did
she
apply
to
the
various
large
shops
the
place
clichy
the
bon
marché
and
the
louvre
the
dead
season
had
stopped
business
everywhere
and
she
was
told
to
apply
again
in
the
autumn
more
than
five
thousand
drapery
employees
dismissed
like
herself
were
wandering
about
paris
in
want
of
situations
she
then
tried
to
obtain
work
elsewhere
but
in
her
ignorance
of
paris
she
did
not
know
where
to
apply
and
often
accepted
most
ungrateful
tasks
sometimes
not
even
getting
paid
on
certain
evenings
she
merely
gave
pépé
his
dinner
a
plate
of
soup
telling
him
that
she
had
dined
out
and
she
would
go
to
bed
with
her
head
in
a
whirl
nourished
by
the
fever
which
was
burning
her
hands
when
jean
suddenly
dropped
into
the
midst
of
this
poverty
he
called
himself
a
scoundrel
with
such
despairing
violence
that
she
was
obliged
to
tell
some
falsehood
to
reassure
him
and
she
even
occasionally
found
the
means
to
slip
a
piece
into
his
hand
by
way
of
proving
that
she
still
had
money
she
never
wept
before
the
children
on
sundays
when
she
was
able
to
cook
a
piece
of
veal
in
the
stove
on
her
knees
before
the
fire
the
tiny
room
with
the
gaiety
of
children
careless
about
existence
then
when
jean
had
returned
to
his
and
pépé
was
asleep
she
spent
a
frightful
night
in
anguish
how
to
provide
for
the
coming
day
other
fears
kept
her
awake
two
women
lodging
on
the
first
floor
received
visitors
and
sometimes
these
visitors
mistook
the
floor
and
came
banging
at
denise
door
bourras
having
quietly
told
her
not
to
answer
she
buried
her
face
under
her
pillow
to
escape
hearing
their
oaths
then
too
her
neighbour
the
baker
who
never
came
home
till
morning
had
shown
a
disposition
to
annoy
her
but
she
suffered
still
more
from
the
annoyances
of
the
street
the
continual
persecution
of
she
could
not
go
downstairs
to
buy
a
candle
in
those
streets
swarming
with
debauchees
without
feeling
a
man
hot
breath
behind
her
and
hearing
crude
insulting
remarks
and
some
individuals
pursued
her
to
the
very
end
of
the
dark
passage
encouraged
by
the
sordid
appearance
of
the
house
why
had
she
no
lover
it
astonished
people
and
seemed
ridiculous
she
herself
could
not
have
explained
why
she
resisted
menaced
as
she
was
by
hunger
and
perturbed
by
all
the
sexuality
in
the
air
around
her
one
evening
when
denise
had
not
even
any
bread
for
pépé
soup
a
man
wearing
a
decoration
commenced
to
follow
her
on
reaching
the
passage
he
became
brutal
and
it
was
with
loathing
and
revolt
that
she
banged
the
door
in
his
face
then
once
more
upstairs
she
sat
down
with
her
hands
trembling
the
little
one
was
sleeping
what
should
she
say
if
he
woke
up
and
asked
her
for
bread
and
yet
had
she
chosen
her
misery
would
have
ceased
she
could
have
had
money
dresses
and
a
fine
room
it
was
very
simple
every
one
came
to
that
it
was
said
for
a
woman
alone
in
paris
could
not
live
by
her
labour
but
her
whole
being
rose
up
in
protest
against
the
disgrace
of
the
thing
she
considered
life
a
matter
of
logic
good
conduct
and
courage
denise
frequently
questioned
herself
in
this
way
an
old
love
story
floated
in
her
memory
the
story
of
a
sailor
betrothed
whom
her
love
guarded
from
all
perils
at
valognes
she
had
often
hummed
this
sentimental
ballad
whilst
gazing
into
the
deserted
street
had
she
likewise
some
tender
affection
in
her
heart
that
she
proved
so
brave
she
still
thought
of
hutin
full
of
uneasiness
morning
and
evening
she
saw
him
pass
under
her
window
now
that
he
was
he
walked
by
himself
saluted
with
respect
by
the
mere
salesmen
he
never
raised
his
head
and
she
thought
she
suffered
from
his
vanity
still
she
watched
him
without
fear
of
being
discovered
whereas
as
soon
as
she
saw
mouret
who
also
passed
every
day
she
began
to
tremble
and
quickly
concealed
herself
her
bosom
heaving
he
had
no
need
to
know
where
she
was
lodging
and
then
she
would
feel
ashamed
of
the
house
and
suffer
at
the
idea
of
what
he
must
think
of
her
although
perhaps
they
would
never
meet
again
denise
still
lived
amidst
all
the
hubbub
of
the
ladies
paradise
a
mere
wall
separated
her
room
from
her
old
department
and
from
early
morning
she
lived
her
old
days
afresh
divining
and
hearing
the
arrival
of
the
crowd
and
the
increasing
bustle
of
business
the
slightest
noise
shook
the
old
hovel
which
clung
to
the
side
of
the
colossus
and
shared
in
its
pulsations
moreover
she
could
not
avoid
certain
meetings
she
twice
had
found
herself
face
to
face
with
pauline
who
had
offered
her
services
grieved
to
see
her
so
unfortunate
and
she
had
even
been
obliged
to
tell
a
falsehood
to
avoid
receiving
her
friend
or
paying
her
a
visit
one
sunday
at
baugé
but
it
was
more
difficult
still
for
her
to
defend
herself
against
desperate
affection
aware
of
all
her
troubles
he
watched
her
waited
for
her
in
the
doorways
one
day
he
wanted
to
lend
her
thirty
francs
a
brother
savings
he
said
with
a
blush
and
these
meetings
made
her
regret
the
shop
and
continually
brought
her
back
to
thoughts
of
the
life
the
others
led
there
as
if
she
herself
had
not
quitted
it
no
one
had
ever
called
upon
her
till
one
afternoon
when
she
was
surprised
by
a
knock
it
was
colomban
she
received
him
standing
for
his
part
he
seemed
greatly
embarrassed
and
began
stammering
asking
how
she
was
getting
on
and
speaking
of
the
old
elbeuf
perhaps
thought
she
it
was
uncle
baudu
who
had
sent
him
regretting
his
rigour
for
he
continued
to
pass
her
without
taking
any
notice
of
her
although
he
was
well
aware
of
her
miserable
position
however
when
she
plainly
questioned
her
visitor
he
appeared
more
embarrassed
than
ever
no
no
it
was
not
the
governor
who
had
sent
him
and
he
finished
by
naming
clara
he
simply
wanted
to
talk
about
clara
then
little
by
little
he
grew
bolder
and
asked
denise
advice
imagining
no
doubt
that
she
might
be
willing
to
play
the
part
of
a
and
it
was
in
vain
that
she
tried
to
dishearten
him
by
reproaching
him
with
the
pain
he
was
causing
geneviève
for
such
a
heartless
girl
he
came
up
another
day
indeed
got
into
the
habit
of
coming
to
see
her
this
seemed
to
suffice
for
his
timid
passion
he
continually
began
the
same
conversation
afresh
unable
to
resist
the
impulse
and
trembling
with
joy
at
finding
himself
with
one
who
had
approached
clara
and
all
this
caused
denise
to
live
more
than
ever
at
the
ladies
paradise
towards
the
end
of
september
the
poor
girl
experienced
the
blackest
misery
pépé
had
fallen
ill
having
caught
a
severe
cold
he
ought
to
have
had
plenty
of
good
broth
and
she
had
not
even
a
piece
of
bread
to
give
him
one
evening
completely
conquered
she
was
sobbing
in
one
of
those
despairing
straits
which
drive
women
on
to
the
streets
or
into
the
seine
when
old
bourras
gently
knocked
at
the
door
he
had
brought
with
him
a
loaf
and
a
full
of
broth
there
there
something
for
the
youngster
said
he
in
his
abrupt
way
do
cry
like
that
it
annoys
my
lodgers
and
as
she
thanked
him
with
a
fresh
outburst
of
tears
he
resumed
do
keep
quiet
come
and
see
me
i
some
work
for
you
since
the
terrible
blow
which
the
ladies
paradise
had
dealt
him
by
opening
an
umbrella
department
bourras
had
ceased
to
employ
any
workwomen
in
order
to
save
expenses
he
did
everything
himself
cleaning
mending
and
sewing
his
trade
moreover
was
diminishing
to
such
a
point
that
he
sometimes
remained
without
work
and
so
he
was
obliged
to
invent
some
occupation
on
the
following
day
when
he
installed
denise
in
a
corner
of
his
shop
he
felt
however
that
he
could
not
allow
any
one
to
die
of
hunger
in
his
house
you
have
two
francs
a
day
said
he
when
you
find
something
better
you
can
leave
me
she
was
afraid
of
him
and
did
the
work
so
quickly
that
he
was
embarrassed
to
find
her
more
he
had
given
her
some
silk
to
stitch
some
lace
to
repair
during
the
first
few
days
she
did
not
dare
to
raise
her
head
uneasy
at
feeling
him
near
her
with
his
mane
hooked
nose
and
piercing
eyes
shaded
by
bushy
brows
his
voice
was
harsh
his
gestures
were
extravagant
and
the
mothers
of
the
neighbourhood
often
frightened
their
youngsters
by
threatening
to
send
for
him
as
they
would
for
a
policeman
however
the
boys
never
passed
his
door
without
calling
out
some
insulting
words
which
he
did
not
even
seem
to
hear
all
his
maniacal
anger
was
directed
against
the
scoundrels
who
dishonoured
his
trade
by
selling
cheap
trashy
articles
which
dogs
said
he
would
not
consent
to
use
denise
trembled
whenever
he
burst
out
thus
art
is
done
for
i
tell
you
there
not
a
single
respectable
handle
made
nowadays
they
make
sticks
but
as
for
handles
it
all
up
bring
me
a
proper
handle
and
i
give
you
twenty
francs
he
had
a
real
artist
pride
not
a
workman
in
paris
was
capable
of
turning
out
a
handle
like
his
as
light
and
as
strong
he
carved
the
knobs
with
charming
ingenuity
continually
inventing
fresh
designs
flowers
fruit
animals
and
heads
all
executed
in
a
free
and
style
a
little
sufficed
him
and
with
his
spectacles
on
his
nose
he
would
spend
whole
days
in
chipping
bits
of
boxwood
and
ebony
a
pack
of
ignorant
beggars
said
he
who
are
satisfied
with
sticking
a
certain
quantity
of
silk
on
so
much
whalebone
they
buy
their
handles
by
the
gross
handles
and
they
sell
just
what
they
like
i
tell
you
art
is
done
for
at
last
denise
began
to
feel
easier
he
had
desired
that
pépé
should
come
down
into
the
shop
to
play
for
he
was
wonderfully
fond
of
children
when
the
little
one
was
crawling
about
on
neither
of
them
had
room
to
move
she
sat
in
her
corner
doing
the
mending
he
near
the
window
carving
away
with
his
little
knife
every
day
now
brought
round
the
same
work
and
the
same
conversation
whilst
working
he
would
continually
assail
the
ladies
paradise
never
weary
of
explaining
how
affairs
stood
in
the
terrible
duel
between
that
bazaar
and
himself
he
had
occupied
his
house
since
and
had
a
thirty
years
lease
of
it
at
a
rent
of
eighteen
hundred
francs
a
year
and
as
he
made
a
thousand
francs
out
of
his
four
furnished
rooms
he
only
paid
eight
hundred
for
the
shop
it
was
a
mere
trifle
he
had
no
expenses
and
could
thus
hold
out
for
a
long
time
still
to
hear
him
there
was
no
doubt
about
his
eventual
triumph
he
would
certainly
swallow
up
the
monster
then
suddenly
he
would
break
off
to
ask
have
they
got
any
dog
heads
like
that
and
he
would
blink
his
eyes
behind
his
glasses
whilst
judging
the
dog
head
which
he
was
carving
with
its
lip
turned
up
and
its
fangs
displayed
in
a
growl
pépé
delighted
with
the
dog
would
thereupon
get
up
resting
his
two
little
arms
on
the
old
man
knee
as
long
as
i
make
both
ends
meet
i
do
care
a
hang
about
the
rest
the
latter
resumed
whilst
delicately
shaping
the
dog
tongue
with
the
point
of
his
knife
the
scoundrels
have
taken
away
my
profits
but
if
i
making
nothing
i
not
losing
anything
yet
or
at
least
only
a
trifle
and
you
see
i
ready
to
sacrifice
everything
rather
than
yield
thereupon
he
would
brandish
his
knife
and
his
white
hair
would
blow
about
in
a
storm
of
anger
but
if
they
made
you
a
reasonable
offer
denise
would
mildly
observe
without
raising
her
eyes
from
her
needle
it
would
be
wiser
to
accept
it
this
suggestion
however
only
produced
an
outburst
of
ferocious
obstinacy
never
if
my
head
were
under
the
knife
i
should
still
say
no
by
heavens
i
would
i
another
ten
years
lease
and
they
have
the
house
before
then
even
if
i
should
have
to
die
of
hunger
within
the
four
bare
walls
twice
already
they
tried
to
get
over
me
they
offered
me
twelve
thousand
francs
for
my
and
eighteen
thousand
francs
for
the
last
ten
years
of
my
lease
in
all
thirty
thousand
but
no
no
not
for
fifty
thousand
even
i
have
them
in
my
power
and
intend
to
see
them
licking
the
dust
before
me
thirty
thousand
francs
it
a
good
sum
thereupon
resumed
denise
you
could
go
and
establish
yourself
elsewhere
and
suppose
they
were
to
buy
the
house
bourras
now
putting
the
finishing
touches
to
his
dog
tongue
appeared
absorbed
for
a
moment
a
childish
laugh
pervading
his
venerable
prophet
face
then
he
continued
the
house
no
fear
they
spoke
of
buying
it
last
year
and
offered
eighty
thousand
francs
twice
as
much
as
it
worth
but
the
landlord
a
retired
fruiterer
as
big
a
scoundrel
as
they
wanted
to
make
them
shell
out
more
besides
they
are
suspicious
about
me
they
know
i
should
then
be
even
less
inclined
to
give
way
no
no
here
i
am
and
here
i
intend
to
stay
the
emperor
with
all
his
cannon
could
not
turn
me
out
denise
did
not
dare
to
say
any
more
but
went
on
with
her
work
whilst
the
old
man
continued
to
vent
short
sentences
between
two
cuts
of
his
knife
now
muttering
something
to
the
effect
that
the
game
had
hardly
begun
and
then
that
they
would
see
wonderful
things
later
on
for
he
had
certain
plans
which
would
sweep
their
umbrella
counter
away
and
deeply
blended
with
his
obstinacy
you
detected
the
personal
revolt
of
the
skilled
manufacturer
against
the
growing
invasion
of
commonplace
rubbish
pépé
however
at
last
climbed
on
his
knees
and
impatiently
stretched
out
his
hands
towards
the
dog
head
give
it
me
sir
presently
youngster
the
old
man
replied
in
a
voice
that
suddenly
became
softer
he
has
any
eyes
as
yet
we
must
make
his
eyes
now
and
whilst
carving
the
eyes
he
continued
talking
to
denise
do
you
hear
them
is
there
a
roar
next
door
that
what
exasperates
me
more
than
anything
my
word
of
honour
to
have
them
always
on
my
back
like
this
with
their
infernal
noise
it
made
his
little
table
tremble
he
asserted
the
whole
shop
was
shaken
and
he
would
spend
the
entire
afternoon
without
a
customer
of
his
own
but
amidst
all
the
trepidation
of
the
jostling
multitude
in
the
ladies
paradise
from
morning
to
night
this
was
a
subject
for
eternal
grumbling
another
good
day
work
they
were
knocking
against
the
wall
the
silk
department
must
have
cleared
ten
thousand
francs
or
else
he
made
merry
not
a
sound
came
from
behind
the
wall
a
showery
day
had
killed
the
receipts
and
the
slightest
stir
the
faintest
vibration
thus
furnished
him
with
matter
for
endless
comment
did
you
hear
some
one
has
slipped
down
ah
if
they
could
only
all
fall
and
break
their
backs
that
my
dear
is
a
dispute
between
some
ladies
so
much
the
better
so
much
the
better
ah
you
hear
the
parcels
falling
into
the
basement
what
a
row
they
make
disgusting
it
did
not
do
for
denise
to
discuss
his
remarks
for
he
bitterly
retorted
by
reminding
her
of
the
shameful
way
in
which
she
had
been
dismissed
for
the
hundredth
time
she
was
obliged
to
relate
her
life
in
the
jacket
and
mantle
department
the
hardships
she
had
at
first
endured
the
small
unhealthy
bedrooms
the
bad
food
and
the
continual
battle
between
the
salesmen
and
thus
they
would
talk
about
the
shop
from
morning
to
night
absorbing
it
hourly
in
the
very
air
they
breathed
but
with
eager
outstretched
hands
pépé
repeated
give
it
me
sir
give
it
me
the
dog
head
was
finished
and
bourras
held
it
at
a
distance
then
examined
it
closely
with
noisy
glee
take
care
it
will
bite
you
he
said
there
go
and
play
and
do
break
it
if
you
can
help
it
then
speedily
reverting
to
his
fixed
idea
he
shook
his
fist
at
the
wall
you
may
do
all
you
can
to
knock
the
house
down
he
exclaimed
you
sha
have
it
even
if
you
invade
the
whole
street
denise
now
had
something
to
eat
each
day
and
she
was
extremely
grateful
to
the
old
realizing
that
he
had
a
good
heart
beneath
his
strange
violent
ways
nevertheless
she
felt
a
strong
desire
to
find
some
work
elsewhere
for
she
often
saw
him
inventing
some
trifle
for
her
to
do
and
fully
understood
that
he
did
not
require
a
workwoman
in
the
present
collapse
of
his
business
and
was
merely
employing
her
out
of
charity
six
months
had
passed
thus
and
the
dull
winter
season
having
again
returned
she
was
despairing
of
finding
a
situation
before
march
when
one
evening
in
january
deloche
who
was
watching
for
her
in
a
doorway
gave
her
a
bit
of
advice
why
did
she
not
call
on
robineau
perhaps
he
might
want
some
one
during
the
previous
september
robineau
though
fearing
to
jeopardize
his
wife
sixty
thousand
francs
had
made
up
his
mind
to
buy
he
had
paid
forty
thousand
for
the
and
stock
and
was
starting
with
the
remaining
twenty
thousand
it
was
not
much
but
he
had
gaujean
behind
him
to
back
him
up
with
any
amount
of
credit
gaujean
ever
since
his
quarrel
with
the
ladies
paradise
had
been
longing
to
stir
up
competitors
against
the
colossus
and
he
thought
victory
certain
by
creating
special
shops
in
the
neighbourhood
where
the
public
would
find
a
large
and
varied
choice
of
articles
only
the
very
rich
lyons
manufacturers
such
as
dumonteil
could
accept
the
big
shops
terms
satisfied
to
keep
their
looms
going
with
them
and
seeking
their
profits
in
their
sales
to
less
important
establishments
but
gaujean
was
far
from
having
the
solidity
and
staying
power
possessed
by
dumonteil
for
a
long
time
a
mere
commission
agent
it
was
only
during
the
last
five
or
six
years
that
he
had
possessed
looms
of
his
own
and
he
still
had
a
lot
of
his
work
done
by
furnishing
them
with
the
raw
material
and
paying
them
by
the
yard
it
was
precisely
this
system
which
increasing
his
manufacturing
expenses
had
prevented
him
from
competing
with
dumonteil
for
the
supply
of
the
paris
delight
this
had
filled
him
with
rancour
and
he
saw
in
robineau
the
instrument
of
a
decisive
battle
with
those
drapery
bazaars
which
he
accused
of
ruining
french
manufactures
when
denise
called
she
found
madame
robineau
alone
daughter
of
an
overseer
in
the
highways
and
bridges
service
entirely
ignorant
of
business
matters
the
young
wife
still
retained
the
charming
awkwardness
of
a
girl
educated
in
a
convent
she
was
dark
very
pretty
with
a
gentle
cheerful
manner
which
made
her
extremely
charming
moreover
she
adored
her
husband
living
solely
by
his
love
just
as
denise
was
about
to
leave
her
name
robineau
himself
came
in
and
at
once
engaged
her
one
of
his
two
saleswomen
having
left
him
on
the
previous
day
to
go
to
the
ladies
paradise
they
do
leave
us
a
single
good
hand
said
he
however
i
shall
feel
quite
easy
with
you
for
you
are
like
me
you
ca
be
very
fond
of
them
come
in
the
evening
denise
hardly
knew
how
to
announce
her
departure
to
bourras
in
fact
he
called
her
an
ungrateful
girl
and
lost
his
temper
and
when
with
tears
in
her
eyes
she
tried
to
defend
herself
by
intimating
that
she
could
see
through
his
charitable
conduct
he
softened
down
stammered
that
he
had
plenty
of
work
that
she
was
leaving
him
indeed
just
as
he
was
about
to
bring
out
a
new
umbrella
of
his
invention
and
pépé
he
asked
this
was
denise
great
trouble
she
dared
not
take
him
back
to
madame
gras
and
could
not
leave
him
alone
in
the
bedroom
shut
up
from
morning
to
night
very
good
i
keep
him
said
the
old
man
he
be
all
right
in
my
shop
we
do
the
cooking
together
and
then
as
she
refused
the
offer
fearing
that
it
might
inconvenience
him
he
thundered
out
great
heavens
have
you
no
confidence
in
me
i
sha
eat
your
child
denise
was
much
happier
at
robineau
he
only
paid
her
sixty
francs
a
month
with
her
board
without
giving
her
any
commission
on
the
sales
that
not
being
the
rule
in
the
houses
but
she
was
treated
with
great
kindness
especially
by
madame
robineau
who
was
always
smiling
at
her
counter
he
nervous
and
worried
was
sometimes
rather
abrupt
at
the
expiration
of
the
first
month
denise
had
become
quite
one
of
the
family
like
the
other
saleswoman
a
silent
consumptive
little
body
the
robineaus
were
not
at
all
particular
before
them
but
freely
talked
of
the
business
whilst
at
table
in
the
which
looked
on
to
a
large
yard
and
it
was
there
they
decided
one
evening
to
start
the
campaign
against
the
ladies
paradise
gaujean
had
come
to
dinner
and
after
the
roast
leg
of
mutton
had
broached
the
subject
in
his
lyonese
voice
thickened
by
the
rhône
fogs
it
getting
unbearable
said
he
they
go
to
dumonteil
purchase
the
sole
right
to
a
design
and
take
three
hundred
pieces
straight
off
insisting
on
a
reduction
of
half
a
franc
a
yard
and
as
they
pay
ready
money
they
also
secure
the
profit
of
eighteen
per
cent
discount
very
often
dumonteil
barely
makes
four
sous
a
yard
out
of
it
he
simply
works
to
keep
his
looms
going
for
a
loom
that
stands
still
is
a
dead
loss
under
these
circumstances
how
can
you
expect
that
we
with
our
limited
plant
and
our
can
keep
up
the
struggle
robineau
pensive
forgot
his
dinner
three
hundred
pieces
he
murmured
i
tremble
when
i
take
a
dozen
and
at
ninety
days
too
they
can
sell
at
a
franc
or
two
francs
cheaper
than
we
can
i
have
calculated
that
their
catalogued
articles
are
offered
at
fifteen
per
cent
less
than
our
own
prices
that
what
kills
the
small
houses
he
was
passing
through
a
period
of
discouragement
his
wife
full
of
anxiety
looked
at
him
with
a
loving
air
she
understood
very
little
about
the
business
all
these
figures
confused
her
she
could
not
understand
why
people
worried
over
things
so
much
when
it
was
so
easy
to
be
gay
and
love
one
another
however
it
sufficed
that
her
husband
desired
to
conquer
and
she
became
as
impassioned
as
he
himself
and
would
have
stood
to
her
counter
till
death
but
why
do
all
the
manufacturers
come
to
an
understanding
together
resumed
robineau
violently
they
could
then
lay
down
the
law
instead
of
submitting
to
it
gaujean
who
had
asked
for
another
slice
of
mutton
was
slowly
chewing
ah
why
why
the
looms
must
be
kept
going
i
tell
you
when
you
have
weavers
a
little
bit
everywhere
in
the
neighbourhood
of
lyons
in
the
gard
in
the
isère
you
ca
stand
still
a
day
without
an
enormous
loss
then
we
who
sometimes
employ
with
ten
or
fifteen
looms
of
their
own
are
better
able
to
control
our
output
whereas
the
big
manufacturers
are
obliged
to
have
continual
outlets
the
quickest
and
most
extensive
possible
and
so
they
are
on
their
knees
before
the
big
shops
i
know
three
or
four
who
each
other
and
who
would
sooner
work
at
a
loss
than
not
obtain
the
orders
but
they
make
up
for
it
with
the
small
establishments
like
yours
yes
if
they
manage
to
live
through
the
big
places
they
make
their
profit
out
of
you
little
fellows
heaven
knows
how
the
crisis
will
end
it
odious
exclaimed
robineau
relieved
by
this
cry
of
anger
denise
was
quietly
listening
with
her
instinctive
love
of
logic
and
life
she
was
secretly
in
favour
of
the
big
shops
they
had
relapsed
into
silence
and
were
eating
some
preserved
french
beans
when
at
last
she
ventured
to
remark
in
a
cheerful
tone
the
public
does
not
complain
at
this
madame
robineau
could
not
restrain
a
little
laugh
which
annoyed
both
her
husband
and
gaujean
no
doubt
the
customer
was
satisfied
for
in
the
end
it
was
the
customer
who
profited
by
the
fall
in
prices
but
everybody
must
live
where
would
they
all
be
if
under
the
pretext
of
conducing
to
the
general
welfare
the
consumer
was
fattened
at
the
expense
of
the
producer
and
then
began
a
long
discussion
denise
affected
to
be
joking
though
all
the
while
producing
solid
arguments
by
the
new
system
the
disappeared
and
this
greatly
contributed
to
cheapen
the
articles
besides
the
manufacturers
could
no
longer
live
without
the
big
shops
for
as
soon
as
one
of
them
lost
their
custom
failure
became
a
certainty
in
short
it
was
a
natural
commercial
evolution
it
would
be
impossible
to
prevent
things
from
going
on
as
they
ought
to
when
everybody
was
working
towards
that
result
whether
they
liked
it
or
not
so
you
are
for
those
who
turned
you
out
into
the
street
thereupon
asked
gaujean
denise
became
very
red
she
herself
was
surprised
at
the
vivacity
of
her
defence
what
had
she
at
heart
that
such
a
flame
should
have
risen
in
her
breast
dear
me
no
she
replied
perhaps
i
wrong
for
you
are
more
competent
to
judge
than
i
simply
express
my
opinion
the
prices
instead
of
being
settled
by
fifty
houses
as
they
formerly
used
to
be
are
now
fixed
by
four
or
five
which
have
lowered
them
thanks
to
the
power
of
their
capital
and
the
strength
of
their
immense
custom
so
much
the
better
for
the
public
that
all
robineau
was
not
angry
but
had
become
grave
and
had
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
he
had
often
felt
the
force
of
the
new
style
of
business
the
evolution
which
the
young
girl
spoke
about
and
in
his
clear
quiet
moments
he
would
ask
himself
why
he
should
try
to
resist
such
a
powerful
current
which
must
carry
everything
before
it
madame
robineau
herself
on
seeing
her
husband
deep
in
thought
glanced
with
approval
at
denise
who
had
modestly
resumed
her
silent
attitude
come
resumed
gaujean
to
cut
short
the
argument
all
that
is
simply
theory
let
talk
of
our
matter
after
the
cheese
the
servant
brought
in
some
jam
and
some
pears
he
took
some
jam
and
ate
it
with
a
spoon
with
the
unconscious
greediness
of
a
big
man
very
fond
sweet
things
this
is
it
he
resumed
you
must
attack
their
paris
delight
which
has
been
their
success
of
the
year
i
have
come
to
an
understanding
with
several
of
my
brother
manufacturers
at
lyons
and
have
brought
you
an
exceptional
offer
a
black
silk
a
faille
which
you
can
sell
at
five
francs
fifty
centimes
a
mêtre
they
sell
theirs
at
five
francs
sixty
do
they
well
this
will
be
two
sous
cheaper
and
that
will
suffice
to
upset
them
at
this
robineau
eyes
lighted
up
again
in
his
continual
nervous
torment
he
often
skipped
like
this
from
despair
to
hope
have
you
got
a
sample
he
asked
and
when
gaujean
drew
from
his
a
little
square
of
silk
he
went
into
raptures
exclaiming
why
this
is
a
handsomer
silk
than
the
paris
delight
at
all
events
it
produces
a
better
effect
the
grain
is
coarser
you
are
right
we
must
make
the
attempt
ah
i
bring
them
to
my
feet
or
give
up
for
good
madame
robineau
sharing
the
enthusiasm
declared
the
silk
superb
and
even
denise
herself
thought
they
might
succeed
the
latter
part
of
the
dinner
thus
proved
very
gay
they
talked
in
a
loud
tone
it
seemed
as
if
the
ladies
paradise
was
at
its
last
gasp
gaujean
who
was
finishing
the
pot
of
jam
explained
what
enormous
sacrifices
he
and
his
colleagues
would
be
obliged
to
make
to
deliver
an
article
of
such
quality
at
so
low
a
price
but
they
would
ruin
themselves
rather
than
yield
they
had
sworn
to
kill
the
big
shops
as
the
coffee
came
in
the
gaiety
was
still
further
increased
by
the
arrival
of
vinçard
who
called
on
his
way
past
just
to
see
how
his
successor
was
getting
on
famous
he
cried
feeling
the
silk
you
floor
them
i
stake
my
life
ah
you
owe
me
a
rare
good
thing
i
told
you
that
this
was
a
golden
affair
he
had
just
taken
a
restaurant
at
vincennes
it
was
an
old
cherished
idea
of
his
slyly
nurtured
while
he
was
struggling
with
his
silk
business
trembling
with
fear
lest
he
should
not
sell
it
before
the
crash
came
and
vowing
that
he
would
afterwards
put
his
money
into
some
undertaking
where
he
could
rob
folks
at
his
ease
the
idea
of
a
restaurant
had
struck
him
at
the
wedding
of
a
cousin
who
had
been
made
to
pay
ten
francs
for
a
tureen
of
dish
water
in
which
floated
some
italian
paste
and
in
presence
of
the
robineaus
the
joy
he
felt
at
having
saddled
them
with
an
unremunerative
business
which
he
had
despaired
of
getting
rid
of
made
his
face
with
its
round
eyes
and
large
mouth
a
face
beaming
with
health
expand
as
it
had
never
done
before
and
your
pains
asked
madame
robineau
my
pains
he
murmured
in
astonishment
yes
those
rheumatic
pains
which
tormented
you
so
much
when
you
were
here
he
then
recollected
the
fibs
he
had
told
and
slightly
coloured
oh
i
suffer
from
them
still
said
he
but
the
country
air
you
know
has
done
me
a
deal
of
good
never
mind
on
your
side
you
done
a
good
stroke
of
business
had
it
not
been
for
my
rheumatics
i
could
soon
have
retired
with
ten
thousand
francs
a
year
yes
on
my
word
of
honour
a
fortnight
later
the
battle
between
robineau
and
the
ladies
paradise
began
it
became
celebrated
and
for
a
time
occupied
the
whole
parisian
market
robineau
using
his
adversary
weapons
had
advertised
extensively
in
the
newspapers
besides
that
he
made
a
fine
display
piling
huge
bales
of
the
famous
silk
in
his
windows
and
displaying
immense
white
tickets
on
which
the
price
five
francs
and
a
half
per
mêtre
appeared
in
gigantic
figures
it
was
this
price
that
caused
a
revolution
among
the
women
it
was
two
sous
less
than
that
charged
at
the
ladies
paradise
and
the
silk
appeared
more
substantial
from
the
first
day
a
crowd
of
customers
flocked
in
madame
marty
bought
a
dress
she
did
not
need
pretending
it
to
be
a
bargain
madame
bourdelais
also
thought
the
silk
very
fine
but
preferred
waiting
guessing
no
doubt
what
would
happen
and
indeed
during
the
following
week
mouret
boldly
reduced
the
price
of
the
paris
delight
by
four
sous
after
a
lively
discussion
with
bourdoncle
and
the
other
managers
in
which
he
had
succeeded
in
convincing
them
that
they
must
accept
the
challenge
even
at
a
sacrifice
for
these
four
sous
represented
a
dead
loss
the
silk
being
already
sold
at
strict
cost
price
it
was
a
heavy
blow
to
robineau
who
had
not
imagined
that
his
rival
would
lower
his
price
for
this
suicidal
style
of
competition
this
practice
of
selling
at
a
loss
was
then
unknown
however
the
tide
of
customers
attracted
by
mouret
cheapness
had
immediately
flown
back
towards
the
rue
whilst
the
shop
in
the
rue
gradually
emptied
gaujean
then
hastened
from
lyons
there
were
hurried
confabulations
and
they
finished
by
coming
to
a
heroic
resolution
the
silk
should
be
lowered
in
price
they
would
sell
it
at
five
francs
six
sous
and
lower
than
that
no
one
could
go
without
acting
madly
but
the
next
day
mouret
marked
his
material
at
five
francs
four
sous
then
the
struggle
became
rageful
robineau
replied
by
five
francs
three
sous
whereupon
mouret
at
once
ticketed
the
paris
delight
at
five
francs
and
two
sous
neither
lowered
more
than
a
sou
at
a
time
now
for
both
lost
considerable
sums
as
often
as
they
made
this
present
to
the
public
the
customers
laughed
delighted
with
this
duel
quite
stirred
by
the
terrible
thrusts
which
the
rivals
dealt
one
another
in
order
to
please
them
at
last
mouret
ventured
as
low
as
five
francs
and
his
staff
paled
and
shuddered
at
such
a
challenge
to
fortune
robineau
utterly
beaten
out
of
breath
also
stopped
at
five
francs
not
having
the
courage
to
go
any
lower
and
thus
they
rested
on
their
positions
face
to
face
with
the
massacre
of
their
goods
around
them
but
if
honour
was
saved
on
both
sides
the
situation
was
becoming
fatal
for
robineau
the
ladies
paradise
had
money
at
its
disposal
and
a
patronage
which
enabled
it
to
balance
its
profits
whereas
he
sustained
by
gaujean
alone
unable
to
recoup
his
losses
by
gaining
on
other
articles
found
himself
nearing
the
end
of
his
tether
slipping
further
and
further
down
the
slope
toward
bankruptcy
he
was
dying
from
his
hardihood
despite
the
numerous
customers
whom
the
hazards
of
the
struggle
had
brought
him
one
of
his
secret
worries
was
to
see
these
customers
slowly
quitting
him
returning
to
the
ladies
paradise
after
all
the
money
he
had
lost
in
the
efforts
he
had
made
to
secure
them
one
day
he
quite
lost
patience
a
customer
madame
de
boves
had
called
at
his
shop
for
some
mantles
for
he
had
added
a
department
to
his
business
she
would
not
come
to
a
decision
however
but
complained
of
the
quality
of
the
material
and
at
last
exclaimed
their
paris
delight
is
a
great
deal
stronger
robineau
restrained
himself
assuring
her
that
she
was
mistaken
with
a
tradesman
politeness
all
the
more
respectful
moreover
as
he
feared
to
reveal
his
inward
revolt
but
just
look
at
the
silk
of
this
cloak
she
resumed
one
would
really
take
it
for
so
much
cobweb
you
may
say
what
you
like
sir
but
their
silk
at
five
francs
is
like
leather
compared
with
this
he
did
not
reply
with
the
blood
rushing
to
his
face
he
kept
his
lips
tightly
closed
in
point
of
fact
he
had
ingeniously
thought
of
buying
some
of
his
rival
silk
for
these
mantles
so
that
it
was
mouret
not
he
who
lost
on
the
material
and
to
conceal
his
practice
he
simply
cut
off
the
selvage
really
he
murmured
at
last
you
think
the
paris
delight
thicker
oh
a
hundred
times
said
madame
de
boves
there
no
comparison
this
injustice
on
her
part
this
fixed
determination
to
run
down
the
goods
in
spite
of
all
evidence
filled
him
with
indignation
and
as
she
was
still
turning
the
mantle
over
with
a
disgusted
air
a
little
bit
of
the
blue
and
silver
selvage
which
through
carelessness
had
not
been
cut
off
appeared
under
the
lining
thereupon
he
could
not
restrain
himself
any
longer
but
confessed
the
truth
at
all
hazards
well
madame
this
is
paris
delight
i
bought
it
myself
look
at
the
selvage
madame
de
boves
went
away
greatly
annoyed
and
a
number
of
customers
quitted
him
for
the
affair
became
known
and
he
amid
this
ruin
when
fear
for
the
future
came
upon
him
only
trembled
for
his
wife
who
had
been
brought
up
in
a
happy
peaceful
home
and
would
never
be
able
to
endure
a
life
of
poverty
what
would
become
of
her
if
a
catastrophe
should
throw
them
into
the
street
with
a
load
of
debts
it
was
his
fault
he
ought
never
to
have
touched
her
money
she
was
obliged
to
comfort
him
was
the
money
as
much
his
as
hers
he
loved
her
dearly
and
she
wanted
nothing
more
she
gave
him
everything
her
heart
and
her
life
they
could
be
heard
embracing
one
another
in
the
back
shop
then
little
by
little
the
affairs
of
the
house
got
into
a
regular
groove
each
month
the
losses
increased
but
with
a
slowness
which
postponed
the
fatal
issue
a
tenacious
hope
sustained
them
and
they
still
predicted
the
approaching
discomfiture
of
the
ladies
paradise
pooh
he
would
say
we
are
young
yet
the
future
is
ours
and
besides
what
matters
if
you
have
done
what
you
wanted
to
do
she
resumed
as
long
as
you
are
satisfied
i
am
as
well
darling
denise
affection
for
them
increased
on
seeing
their
tenderness
she
trembled
divining
their
inevitable
fall
however
she
dared
not
interfere
and
it
was
here
that
she
ended
by
fully
understanding
the
power
of
the
new
system
of
business
and
became
impassioned
for
this
force
which
was
transforming
paris
her
ideas
were
ripening
a
grace
was
being
evolved
from
the
wildness
of
a
child
freshly
arrived
from
valognes
her
life
too
was
a
pretty
pleasant
one
notwithstanding
its
fatigue
and
the
little
money
she
earned
when
she
had
spent
all
the
day
on
her
feet
she
had
to
go
straight
home
and
look
after
pépé
whom
old
bourras
fortunately
insisted
on
feeding
but
there
was
still
a
lot
to
do
a
shirt
to
wash
a
blouse
to
mend
without
mentioning
the
noise
made
by
the
youngster
which
made
her
head
ache
fit
to
split
she
never
went
to
bed
before
midnight
sunday
was
her
hardest
day
for
she
then
cleaned
her
room
and
mended
her
own
things
so
busy
that
it
was
often
five
before
she
could
comb
her
hair
however
she
sometimes
went
out
for
health
sake
taking
the
little
one
for
a
long
walk
out
towards
neuilly
and
their
treat
over
there
was
to
drink
a
cup
of
milk
at
a
dairyman
who
allowed
them
to
sit
down
in
his
yard
jean
disdained
these
excursions
he
put
in
an
appearance
now
and
again
on
evenings
and
then
disappeared
pretending
he
had
other
visits
to
pay
he
asked
for
no
more
money
but
he
arrived
with
such
a
melancholy
countenance
that
his
anxious
sister
always
managed
to
keep
a
piece
for
him
that
was
her
sole
luxury
five
francs
he
would
exclaim
each
time
my
stars
you
too
good
it
just
happens
there
the
not
another
word
denise
would
say
i
do
want
to
know
three
months
passed
away
spring
was
coming
back
however
denise
refused
to
return
to
joinville
with
pauline
and
baugé
she
sometimes
met
them
in
the
rue
on
leaving
the
shop
in
the
evening
pauline
on
one
occasion
when
she
was
alone
confided
to
her
that
she
was
perhaps
going
to
marry
her
lover
it
was
she
who
was
hesitating
for
they
did
not
care
for
married
saleswomen
at
the
ladies
paradise
this
idea
of
marriage
surprised
denise
and
she
did
not
dare
to
advise
her
friend
then
one
day
just
as
colomban
had
stopped
her
near
the
fountain
to
talk
about
clara
the
latter
tripped
across
the
road
and
denise
was
obliged
to
run
away
for
he
implored
her
to
ask
her
old
comrade
if
she
would
marry
him
what
was
the
matter
with
them
all
why
were
they
tormenting
themselves
like
this
she
thought
herself
very
fortunate
not
to
be
in
love
with
anybody
you
heard
the
news
the
umbrella
dealer
said
to
her
one
evening
on
her
return
from
business
no
monsieur
bourras
well
the
scoundrels
have
bought
the
hôtel
duvillard
i
hemmed
in
on
all
sides
he
was
waving
his
long
arms
about
in
a
burst
of
fury
which
made
his
white
mane
stand
up
on
end
a
regular
underhand
affair
he
resumed
but
it
seems
that
the
hotel
belonged
to
the
crédit
immobilier
whose
president
baron
hartmann
has
just
sold
it
to
our
famous
mouret
and
now
they
got
me
on
the
right
on
the
left
and
at
the
back
just
in
the
way
that
i
holding
the
knob
of
this
stick
in
my
hand
it
was
true
the
sale
must
have
been
concluded
on
the
previous
day
bourras
small
house
hemmed
in
between
the
ladies
paradise
and
the
hôtel
duvillard
clinging
there
like
a
swallow
nest
in
a
crack
of
a
wall
seemed
certain
to
be
crushed
as
soon
as
the
shop
galleries
should
invade
the
hôtel
and
the
time
had
now
arrived
the
colossus
had
outflanked
the
feeble
obstacle
and
was
investing
it
with
its
piles
of
goods
threatening
to
swallow
it
up
absorb
it
by
the
sole
force
of
its
giant
aspiratory
powers
bourras
could
well
feel
the
close
embrace
which
was
making
his
shop
creak
he
thought
he
could
see
the
place
getting
smaller
he
was
afraid
of
being
absorbed
himself
of
being
carried
off
into
kingdom
come
with
his
sticks
and
umbrellas
so
loudly
was
the
terrible
machine
now
roaring
do
you
hear
them
he
asked
one
would
think
they
were
eating
the
very
walls
and
in
my
cellar
and
in
the
attic
everywhere
there
the
same
noise
like
that
of
a
saw
cutting
through
the
plaster
but
never
mind
they
wo
flatten
me
as
easily
as
they
might
a
sheet
of
paper
i
shall
stick
here
even
if
they
blow
up
my
roof
and
the
rain
falls
in
bucketfuls
on
my
bed
it
was
just
at
this
moment
that
mouret
caused
fresh
proposals
to
be
made
to
bourras
they
would
increase
the
figure
of
their
offer
they
would
give
him
fifty
thousand
francs
for
his
and
the
remainder
of
his
lease
but
this
offer
redoubled
the
old
man
anger
he
refused
in
an
insulting
manner
how
those
scoundrels
must
rob
people
to
be
able
to
pay
fifty
thousand
francs
for
a
thing
which
was
worth
ten
thousand
and
he
defended
his
shop
as
a
young
girl
defends
her
virtue
for
honour
sake
denise
noticed
that
bourras
was
during
the
next
fortnight
he
wandered
about
in
a
feverish
manner
measuring
the
walls
of
his
house
surveying
it
from
the
middle
of
the
street
with
the
air
of
an
architect
then
one
morning
some
workmen
arrived
this
was
the
decisive
blow
he
had
conceived
the
bold
idea
of
beating
the
paradise
on
its
own
ground
by
making
certain
concessions
to
modern
luxury
customers
who
had
often
reproached
him
for
the
darkness
of
his
shop
would
certainly
come
back
to
it
again
when
they
saw
it
all
bright
and
new
in
the
first
place
the
workmen
stopped
up
the
crevices
and
whitewashed
the
frontage
then
they
painted
the
woodwork
a
light
green
and
even
carried
the
splendour
so
far
as
to
gild
the
a
sum
of
three
thousand
francs
held
in
reserve
by
bourras
as
a
last
resource
was
swallowed
up
in
this
way
moreover
the
whole
neighbourhood
was
revolutionized
by
it
all
people
came
to
look
at
him
losing
his
head
amid
all
these
riches
and
no
longer
able
to
find
the
things
he
was
accustomed
to
he
did
not
seem
to
be
at
home
in
that
bright
frame
that
tender
setting
he
looked
quite
scared
with
his
long
beard
and
white
hair
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
lingered
in
astonishment
at
seeing
him
waving
his
arms
about
while
he
carved
his
handles
and
he
was
in
a
state
of
fever
perpetually
afraid
of
dirtying
his
shop
more
and
more
at
sea
amidst
this
luxury
which
he
did
not
at
all
understand
meantime
as
at
robineau
so
at
bourras
was
the
campaign
against
the
ladies
paradise
carried
on
bourras
had
just
brought
out
his
invention
the
automatic
umbrella
which
later
on
was
to
become
popular
but
the
paradise
people
immediately
improved
on
the
invention
and
a
struggle
of
prices
began
bourras
had
an
article
at
one
franc
and
nineteen
sous
in
zanella
with
a
steel
mounting
an
everlasting
article
said
the
ticket
but
he
was
especially
anxious
to
vanquish
his
competitors
with
his
handles
of
bamboo
dogwood
olive
myrtle
rattan
indeed
every
imaginable
sort
of
handle
the
paradise
people
less
artistic
paid
more
attention
to
the
material
extolling
their
alpacas
and
mohairs
twills
and
sarcenets
and
they
came
out
victorious
bourras
in
despair
repeated
that
art
was
done
for
that
he
was
reduced
to
carving
his
handles
for
the
pleasure
of
doing
so
without
any
hope
of
selling
them
it
my
fault
he
cried
to
denise
i
never
ought
to
have
kept
a
lot
of
rotten
articles
at
one
franc
nineteen
sous
that
where
these
new
notions
lead
one
to
i
wanted
to
follow
the
example
of
those
brigands
so
much
the
better
if
i
ruined
by
it
the
month
of
july
proved
very
warm
and
denise
suffered
greatly
in
her
tiny
room
under
the
roof
so
after
leaving
the
shop
she
sometimes
went
to
fetch
pépé
and
instead
of
going
at
once
took
a
stroll
in
the
tuileries
gardens
until
the
gates
closed
one
evening
as
she
was
walking
towards
the
she
suddenly
stopped
short
with
surprise
for
a
few
yards
off
coming
straight
towards
her
she
fancied
she
recognised
hutin
but
her
heart
commenced
to
beat
violently
it
was
mouret
who
had
dined
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
and
was
hurrying
along
on
foot
to
call
on
madame
desforges
at
the
abrupt
movement
which
she
made
to
escape
him
he
caught
sight
of
her
the
night
was
coming
on
but
still
he
recognised
her
clearly
ah
it
you
mademoiselle
he
said
she
did
not
reply
astonished
that
he
should
deign
to
stop
he
smiling
concealed
his
constraint
beneath
an
air
of
amiable
protection
you
are
still
in
paris
he
inquired
yes
sir
said
she
at
last
she
was
slowly
drawing
back
desirous
of
making
a
bow
and
continuing
her
walk
but
he
abruptly
turned
and
followed
her
under
the
dark
shadows
of
the
the
air
was
getting
cooler
some
children
were
laughing
in
the
distance
while
trundling
their
hoops
this
is
your
brother
is
it
not
he
resumed
looking
at
pépé
the
little
boy
frightened
by
the
unusual
presence
of
a
gentleman
was
walking
gravely
by
his
sister
side
holding
her
tightly
by
the
hand
yes
sir
she
replied
once
more
and
as
she
did
so
she
blushed
thinking
of
the
abominable
inventions
circulated
by
marguerite
and
clara
no
doubt
mouret
understood
why
she
was
blushing
for
he
quickly
added
listen
mademoiselle
i
have
to
apologize
to
you
yes
i
should
have
been
happy
to
have
told
you
sooner
how
much
i
regret
the
error
that
was
made
you
were
accused
too
lightly
of
a
fault
however
the
evil
is
done
i
simply
wanted
to
assure
you
that
every
one
in
our
establishment
now
knows
of
your
affection
for
your
brothers
then
he
went
on
speaking
with
a
respectful
politeness
to
which
the
saleswomen
of
the
ladies
paradise
were
little
accustomed
denise
confusion
had
increased
but
her
heart
was
full
of
joy
he
knew
then
that
she
had
ever
remained
virtuous
both
remained
silent
he
still
lingered
beside
her
regulating
his
walk
to
the
child
short
steps
and
the
distant
murmurs
of
the
city
died
away
under
the
black
shadows
of
the
spreading
i
have
only
one
reparation
to
offer
you
he
resumed
naturally
if
you
would
like
to
come
back
to
us
but
she
interrupted
him
refusing
his
offer
with
a
feverish
haste
no
sir
i
can
not
thank
you
all
the
same
but
i
have
found
another
situation
he
knew
it
they
had
informed
him
she
was
with
robineau
and
leisurely
putting
himself
on
a
footing
of
amiable
equality
he
spoke
of
the
latter
rendering
him
full
justice
he
was
a
very
intelligent
fellow
no
doubt
but
too
nervous
he
would
certainly
come
to
grief
gaujean
had
burdened
him
with
a
very
heavy
business
in
which
they
would
both
suffer
thereupon
denise
subjugated
by
this
familiarity
opened
her
mind
further
and
allowed
it
to
be
seen
that
she
was
on
the
side
of
the
big
shops
in
the
war
between
them
and
the
small
traders
she
grew
animated
citing
examples
showing
herself
well
up
in
the
question
and
even
expressing
new
and
enlightened
ideas
he
quite
charmed
listened
to
her
in
surprise
and
turned
round
trying
to
distinguish
her
features
in
the
growing
darkness
she
appeared
to
be
still
the
same
with
her
simple
dress
and
sweet
face
but
from
amidst
her
modest
bashfulness
there
seemed
to
ascend
a
penetrating
perfume
of
which
he
felt
the
powerful
influence
doubtless
this
little
girl
had
got
used
to
the
atmosphere
of
paris
she
was
becoming
quite
a
woman
and
was
really
perturbing
with
her
sound
and
her
beautiful
hair
as
you
are
on
our
side
said
he
laughing
why
do
you
stay
with
our
adversaries
i
was
told
too
that
you
lodged
with
bourras
a
very
worthy
man
she
murmured
no
not
a
bit
of
it
he
an
old
idiot
a
madman
who
will
force
me
to
ruin
him
though
i
should
be
glad
to
get
rid
of
him
with
a
fortune
besides
your
place
is
not
in
his
house
which
has
a
bad
reputation
he
lets
to
certain
women
but
realizing
that
the
young
girl
was
confused
he
hastened
to
add
oh
one
can
be
respectable
anywhere
and
there
even
more
merit
in
remaining
so
when
one
is
so
poor
they
took
a
few
steps
in
silence
pépé
seemed
to
be
listening
with
the
attentive
air
of
a
precocious
child
now
and
again
he
raised
his
eyes
to
his
sister
whose
burning
hand
quivering
with
sudden
starts
astonished
him
look
here
resumed
mouret
gaily
will
you
be
my
ambassador
i
intended
increasing
my
offer
of
proposing
eighty
thousand
francs
to
bourras
will
you
speak
to
him
first
about
it
tell
him
cutting
his
own
throat
perhaps
he
listen
to
you
as
he
has
a
liking
for
you
and
you
be
doing
him
a
real
service
very
well
said
denise
smiling
also
i
will
deliver
your
message
but
i
am
afraid
i
shall
not
succeed
then
a
fresh
silence
ensued
neither
of
them
having
anything
more
to
say
for
a
moment
he
attempted
to
talk
of
her
uncle
baudu
but
had
to
give
it
up
on
seeing
how
uncomfortable
this
made
the
girl
nevertheless
they
continued
walking
side
by
side
and
at
last
found
themselves
near
the
rue
de
rivoli
in
a
path
where
it
was
still
light
on
emerging
from
the
darkness
of
the
trees
this
was
like
a
sudden
awakening
he
understood
that
he
could
not
detain
her
any
longer
good
night
mademoiselle
he
said
good
night
sir
nevertheless
he
did
not
go
away
on
raising
his
eyes
he
had
perceived
in
front
of
him
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
the
lighted
windows
of
madame
desforges
flat
whither
he
was
bound
and
looking
at
denise
whom
he
could
now
see
in
the
pale
twilight
she
appeared
to
him
very
puny
compared
to
henriette
why
was
it
then
that
she
touched
his
heart
in
this
manner
it
was
a
stupid
caprice
this
little
man
is
getting
tired
he
resumed
by
way
of
saying
something
remember
mind
that
our
house
will
always
be
open
to
you
you
only
to
knock
and
i
give
you
every
compensation
possible
good
night
mademoiselle
good
night
sir
when
mouret
had
quitted
her
denise
went
back
under
the
into
the
black
gloom
for
a
long
time
she
walked
on
at
random
between
the
huge
trunks
her
face
burning
her
head
in
a
whirl
of
confused
ideas
pépé
still
held
her
hand
and
was
stretching
out
his
short
legs
to
keep
pace
with
her
she
had
forgotten
him
but
at
last
he
said
you
go
too
quick
little
mother
at
this
she
sat
down
on
a
bench
and
as
he
was
tired
the
child
went
to
sleep
on
her
lap
she
held
him
there
pressing
him
to
her
virgin
bosom
her
eyes
wandering
far
away
into
the
darkness
when
an
hour
later
they
slowly
returned
to
the
rue
de
la
michodière
she
had
regained
her
usual
quiet
sensible
expression
hell
and
thunder
shouted
bourras
when
he
saw
her
coming
the
blow
is
struck
that
rascal
of
a
mouret
has
just
bought
my
house
he
was
half
mad
and
was
striking
himself
in
the
middle
of
the
shop
with
such
outrageous
gestures
that
he
almost
broke
the
windows
ah
the
scoundrel
it
the
fruiterer
who
written
to
tell
me
of
it
and
how
much
do
you
think
the
rogue
has
got
for
the
house
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
four
times
its
value
there
another
thief
if
you
like
just
fancy
he
has
taken
advantage
of
my
embellishments
making
capital
out
of
the
fact
that
the
house
has
been
done
up
how
much
longer
are
they
going
to
make
a
fool
of
me
the
thought
that
his
money
spent
on
paint
and
whitewash
had
brought
the
fruiterer
a
profit
exasperated
him
and
now
mouret
would
be
his
landlord
he
would
have
to
pay
him
it
was
beneath
this
detested
competitor
roof
that
he
must
in
future
live
such
a
thought
raised
his
fury
to
the
highest
pitch
ah
i
could
hear
them
digging
a
hole
through
the
wall
at
this
moment
they
are
here
eating
out
of
my
very
plate
so
to
say
and
the
shop
shook
under
his
heavy
fist
as
he
banged
it
on
the
counter
making
the
umbrellas
and
the
parasols
dance
again
denise
bewildered
could
not
get
in
a
word
she
stood
there
motionless
waiting
for
the
end
of
this
fit
whilst
pépé
very
tired
fell
asleep
again
this
time
on
a
chair
at
last
when
bourras
became
a
little
calmer
she
resolved
to
deliver
mouret
message
no
doubt
the
old
man
was
irritated
but
the
excess
even
of
his
anger
the
blind
alley
as
it
were
in
which
he
found
himself
might
determine
an
abrupt
acceptance
on
his
part
i
just
met
some
one
she
commenced
yes
a
person
from
the
paradise
who
is
very
well
informed
it
appears
that
they
are
going
to
offer
you
eighty
thousand
francs
eighty
thousand
francs
he
interrupted
in
a
terrible
voice
eighty
thousand
francs
not
for
a
million
now
she
tried
to
reason
with
him
but
at
that
moment
the
shop
door
opened
and
she
suddenly
drew
back
pale
and
silent
it
was
her
uncle
baudu
with
his
yellow
face
and
aged
look
bourras
caught
his
neighbour
by
the
buttonhole
and
without
allowing
him
to
say
a
word
as
if
goaded
on
by
his
presence
roared
in
his
face
what
do
you
think
they
have
the
cheek
to
offer
me
eighty
thousand
francs
they
got
to
that
point
the
brigands
they
think
i
going
to
sell
myself
like
a
prostitute
ah
they
bought
the
house
and
think
they
got
me
now
well
all
over
they
sha
have
it
i
might
have
given
way
perhaps
but
now
it
belongs
to
them
let
them
try
to
take
it
so
the
news
is
true
said
baudu
in
his
slow
voice
i
had
heard
of
it
and
came
over
to
know
if
it
was
so
eighty
thousand
francs
repeated
bourras
why
not
a
hundred
thousand
at
once
it
this
immense
sum
of
money
that
makes
me
so
indignant
do
they
think
they
can
make
me
commit
a
knavish
trick
with
their
money
they
sha
have
it
by
heavens
never
never
you
hear
me
then
denise
broke
her
silence
to
remark
in
her
calm
quiet
way
they
have
it
in
nine
years
time
when
your
lease
expires
and
notwithstanding
her
uncle
presence
she
begged
the
old
man
to
accept
the
struggle
was
becoming
impossible
he
was
fighting
against
a
superior
force
it
would
be
madness
to
refuse
the
fortune
offered
him
but
he
still
replied
no
in
nine
years
time
he
hoped
to
be
dead
so
as
not
to
see
it
you
hear
monsieur
baudu
he
resumed
your
niece
is
on
their
side
it
she
whom
they
have
commissioned
to
corrupt
me
she
with
the
brigands
my
word
of
honour
baudu
who
had
so
far
appeared
not
to
notice
denise
now
raised
his
head
with
the
surly
movement
that
he
affected
when
standing
at
his
shop
door
every
time
she
passed
but
slowly
he
turned
round
and
looked
at
her
and
his
thick
lips
trembled
i
know
it
he
replied
in
an
undertone
and
he
continued
looking
at
her
denise
affected
almost
to
tears
thought
him
greatly
changed
by
worry
perhaps
too
he
was
stricken
with
remorse
at
not
having
assisted
her
during
the
time
of
misery
through
which
she
had
lately
passed
then
the
sight
of
pépé
sleeping
on
the
chair
amidst
the
hubbub
of
the
discussion
seemed
to
suddenly
inspire
him
with
compassion
denise
said
he
simply
come
and
have
dinner
with
us
and
bring
the
little
one
my
wife
and
geneviève
asked
me
to
invite
you
if
i
met
you
she
turned
very
red
went
up
to
him
and
kissed
him
and
as
he
was
going
away
bourras
delighted
at
this
reconciliation
again
cried
out
to
him
just
give
her
a
lecture
she
is
a
bad
sort
as
for
me
the
house
may
fall
i
shall
be
found
in
the
ruins
our
houses
are
already
falling
neighbour
said
baudu
with
a
gloomy
air
we
shall
all
of
us
be
crushed
under
them
chapter
viii
at
this
time
the
whole
neighbourhood
was
talking
of
the
great
thoroughfare
which
was
to
be
opened
between
the
bourse
and
the
new
opera
house
under
the
name
of
the
rue
du
the
expropriation
judgments
had
been
delivered
and
two
gangs
of
demolishers
were
already
beginning
operations
at
either
end
the
first
pulling
down
the
old
mansions
in
the
rue
and
the
other
destroying
the
thin
walls
of
the
old
vaudeville
you
could
hear
the
picks
getting
closer
and
the
rue
de
choiseul
and
the
rue
de
la
michodière
waxing
quite
excited
over
their
condemned
houses
before
a
fortnight
passed
the
opening
would
leave
in
both
these
streets
a
great
gap
full
of
sunlight
and
uproar
this
is
at
the
present
day
the
rue
du
quatre
septembre
napoleon
iii
gave
as
the
name
of
the
new
thoroughfare
the
date
of
his
coronation
and
after
sedan
the
republican
government
ironically
retorted
by
altering
the
name
to
the
date
of
his
downfall
but
what
stirred
up
the
district
still
more
was
the
work
undertaken
at
the
ladies
paradise
people
talked
of
considerable
enlargements
of
gigantic
shops
with
frontages
on
the
rue
de
la
michodière
the
rue
and
the
rue
monsigny
mouret
it
was
said
had
made
arrangements
with
baron
hartmann
the
chairman
of
the
crédit
immobilier
and
would
occupy
the
whole
block
excepting
the
future
frontage
in
the
rue
du
where
the
baron
wished
to
erect
a
rival
establishment
to
the
grand
hôtel
the
paradise
people
were
buying
up
leases
on
all
sides
shops
were
closing
and
tenants
moving
and
in
the
empty
buildings
an
army
of
workmen
was
commencing
the
various
alterations
amidst
a
cloud
of
plaster
and
alone
in
all
this
disorder
old
bourras
narrow
hovel
remained
intact
still
obstinately
clinging
between
the
high
walls
covered
with
masons
when
on
the
following
day
denise
went
with
pépé
to
her
uncle
baudu
the
street
was
blocked
up
by
a
line
of
carts
discharging
bricks
outside
the
hôtel
duvillard
baudu
was
standing
at
his
shop
door
looking
on
with
a
gloomy
air
in
proportion
as
the
ladies
paradise
became
larger
the
old
elbeuf
seemed
to
grow
smaller
the
young
girl
thought
that
the
windows
looked
blacker
than
ever
lower
and
lower
still
beneath
the
first
storey
with
its
rounded
windows
the
damp
moreover
had
still
further
discoloured
the
old
green
woefulness
appeared
on
the
whole
frontage
livid
in
hue
and
as
it
were
shrunken
here
you
are
then
said
baudu
take
care
they
would
run
right
over
you
inside
the
shop
denise
experienced
the
same
heart
pang
she
found
it
darker
steeped
more
deeply
than
ever
in
the
somnolence
of
approaching
ruin
empty
corners
formed
dark
cavities
dust
was
covering
the
counters
and
filling
the
drawers
whilst
a
odour
of
saltpetre
rose
from
the
bales
of
cloth
that
were
no
longer
moved
about
at
the
desk
madame
baudu
and
geneviève
stood
mute
and
motionless
as
in
some
solitary
spot
where
no
one
would
come
to
disturb
them
the
mother
was
hemming
some
dusters
the
daughter
her
hands
resting
on
her
knees
was
gazing
at
the
emptiness
before
her
good
evening
aunt
said
denise
i
delighted
to
see
you
again
and
if
i
have
hurt
your
feelings
i
hope
you
will
forgive
me
madame
baudu
kissed
her
greatly
affected
my
poor
child
said
she
if
i
had
no
other
troubles
you
would
see
me
gayer
than
this
good
evening
cousin
resumed
denise
kissing
geneviève
on
the
cheeks
the
latter
woke
with
a
sort
of
start
and
returned
her
kisses
but
without
finding
a
word
to
say
then
the
two
women
took
up
pépé
who
was
holding
out
his
little
arms
and
the
reconciliation
was
complete
well
it
six
let
go
to
dinner
said
baudu
why
you
brought
jean
well
he
was
to
have
come
murmured
denise
in
embarrassment
i
saw
him
this
morning
and
he
faithfully
promised
me
oh
we
must
not
wait
for
him
his
master
has
kept
him
i
dare
say
in
reality
she
suspected
some
extraordinary
adventure
and
wished
to
apologize
for
him
in
advance
in
that
case
we
will
commence
said
her
uncle
and
turning
towards
the
dim
depths
of
the
shop
he
added
you
may
as
well
dine
with
us
colomban
no
one
will
come
denise
had
not
noticed
the
assistant
her
aunt
explained
to
her
that
they
had
been
obliged
to
get
rid
of
the
other
salesman
and
the
young
lady
business
was
getting
so
bad
that
colomban
sufficed
and
even
he
spent
many
idle
hours
drowsy
falling
asleep
with
his
eyes
open
the
gas
was
burning
in
the
although
they
were
now
in
the
long
days
of
summer
denise
shivered
slightly
as
she
went
in
chilled
by
the
dampness
oozing
from
the
walls
she
once
more
beheld
the
round
table
the
places
laid
on
the
american
cloth
the
window
deriving
its
air
and
light
from
the
dark
and
fetid
and
all
these
things
appeared
to
her
to
be
gloomier
than
ever
and
tearful
like
the
shop
father
said
geneviève
uncomfortable
for
denise
sake
shall
i
close
the
window
there
rather
a
bad
smell
he
himself
smelt
nothing
and
seemed
surprised
shut
the
window
if
you
like
he
replied
at
last
but
we
sha
get
any
air
then
and
indeed
they
were
almost
stifled
it
was
a
very
simple
family
dinner
after
the
soup
as
soon
as
the
servant
had
served
the
boiled
beef
the
old
man
as
usual
began
talking
about
the
people
opposite
at
first
he
showed
himself
very
tolerant
allowing
his
niece
to
have
a
different
opinion
dear
me
said
he
you
are
quite
free
to
support
those
big
tricky
shows
each
person
has
his
ideas
my
girl
if
you
were
not
disgusted
at
being
so
disgracefully
chucked
out
you
must
have
strong
reasons
for
liking
them
and
even
if
you
went
back
again
i
should
think
none
the
worse
of
you
no
one
here
would
be
offended
would
they
oh
no
murmured
madame
baudu
thereupon
denise
quietly
gave
her
reasons
for
her
preference
just
as
she
had
at
robineau
explaining
the
logical
evolution
in
business
the
necessities
of
modern
times
the
greatness
of
these
new
creations
in
short
the
growing
of
the
public
baudu
his
eyes
dilated
and
his
mouth
clammy
listened
with
a
visible
mental
strain
then
when
she
had
finished
he
shook
his
head
that
all
phantasmagoria
you
know
business
is
business
there
no
getting
over
that
oh
i
own
that
they
succeed
but
that
all
for
a
long
time
i
thought
they
would
smash
up
yes
i
expected
that
waiting
patiently
you
remember
well
no
it
appears
that
nowadays
thieves
make
fortunes
whilst
honest
people
die
of
hunger
that
what
come
to
i
obliged
to
bow
to
facts
and
i
do
bow
on
my
word
i
do
bow
to
them
a
deep
anger
was
gradually
rising
within
him
all
at
once
he
flourished
his
fork
but
the
old
elbeuf
will
never
give
way
i
said
as
much
to
bourras
you
know
said
i
going
over
to
the
cheapjacks
your
paint
and
your
varnish
are
a
disgrace
to
you
eat
your
dinner
interrupted
madame
baudu
feeling
anxious
on
seeing
him
so
excited
wait
a
bit
i
want
my
niece
thoroughly
to
understand
my
motto
just
listen
my
girl
i
like
this
decanter
i
do
budge
they
succeed
so
much
the
worse
for
them
as
for
me
i
protest
that
all
the
servant
brought
in
a
piece
of
roast
veal
he
cut
it
up
with
trembling
hands
and
no
longer
showed
his
accurate
glance
his
deft
skill
in
weighing
the
portions
the
consciousness
of
his
defeat
deprived
him
of
the
confidence
he
had
formerly
possessed
as
a
respected
employer
pépé
had
thought
that
his
uncle
was
getting
angry
and
they
had
to
pacify
him
by
giving
him
some
dessert
some
biscuits
which
were
near
his
plate
then
baudu
lowering
his
voice
tried
to
talk
of
something
else
for
a
moment
he
spoke
of
the
demolitions
going
on
approving
of
the
rue
du
the
piercing
of
which
would
certainly
increase
the
business
of
the
neighbourhood
but
then
he
again
returned
to
the
ladies
paradise
everything
brought
him
back
to
it
as
to
a
chronic
complaint
they
were
being
covered
with
plaster
and
business
had
quite
ceased
since
the
builders
carts
had
commenced
to
block
up
the
street
moreover
the
place
would
soon
be
really
ridiculous
in
its
immensity
the
customers
would
lose
themselves
in
it
why
not
have
the
central
markets
at
once
and
in
spite
of
his
wife
supplicating
looks
notwithstanding
his
own
effort
he
went
on
from
the
works
to
the
amount
of
business
done
in
the
big
shop
was
it
not
inconceivable
in
less
than
four
years
they
had
increased
their
figures
the
annual
receipts
formerly
some
eight
million
francs
now
attained
the
sum
of
forty
millions
according
to
the
last
in
fact
it
was
a
piece
of
folly
a
thing
that
had
never
been
seen
before
and
against
which
it
was
perfectly
useless
to
struggle
they
were
always
swelling
and
growing
they
now
had
a
thousand
employees
and
departments
those
departments
enraged
him
more
than
anything
else
no
doubt
they
had
duplicated
a
few
but
others
were
quite
new
for
instance
a
furniture
department
and
a
department
for
fancy
goods
the
idea
fancy
goods
really
those
people
had
no
pride
whatever
they
would
even
end
by
selling
fish
then
baudu
though
still
affecting
to
respect
opinions
attempted
to
convert
her
frankly
you
ca
defend
them
what
would
you
say
if
i
were
to
add
an
ironmongery
department
to
my
cloth
business
you
would
say
i
was
mad
eh
confess
at
least
that
you
do
esteem
them
and
as
the
young
girl
simply
smiled
feeling
uncomfortable
and
realizing
how
futile
the
best
of
reasons
would
be
he
resumed
in
short
you
are
on
their
side
we
wo
talk
about
it
any
more
for
useless
to
let
that
part
us
again
that
would
be
the
climax
to
see
them
come
between
me
and
my
family
go
back
with
them
if
you
like
but
pray
do
worry
me
with
any
more
of
their
stories
a
silence
ensued
his
previous
violence
fell
to
this
feverish
resignation
as
they
were
suffocating
in
the
narrow
room
heated
by
the
the
servant
had
to
open
the
window
again
and
the
damp
pestilential
air
from
the
yard
blew
into
the
apartment
a
dish
of
potatoes
had
appeared
and
they
helped
themselves
slowly
without
a
word
look
at
those
two
began
baudu
again
pointing
with
his
knife
to
geneviève
and
colomban
ask
them
if
they
like
your
ladies
paradise
side
by
side
in
the
places
where
they
had
found
themselves
twice
for
the
last
twelve
years
colomban
and
geneviève
were
eating
slowly
without
uttering
a
word
he
exaggerating
the
coarse
of
his
face
seemed
to
be
concealing
behind
his
drooping
eyelashes
the
inward
flame
which
was
consuming
him
whilst
she
her
head
bowed
lower
beneath
her
heavy
hair
appeared
to
be
giving
way
entirely
as
if
a
prey
to
some
secret
grief
last
year
was
very
disastrous
explained
baudu
and
we
have
been
obliged
to
postpone
the
marriage
just
to
please
them
ask
them
what
they
think
of
your
friends
in
order
to
pacify
him
denise
interrogated
the
young
people
naturally
i
ca
be
very
fond
of
them
cousin
replied
geneviève
but
never
fear
every
one
does
detest
them
and
so
speaking
she
looked
at
colomban
who
was
rolling
up
some
with
an
absorbed
air
but
when
he
felt
that
the
young
girl
gaze
was
turned
upon
him
he
broke
out
into
a
series
of
violent
exclamations
a
rotten
shop
a
lot
of
rogues
every
of
them
in
fact
a
regular
pest
in
the
neighbourhood
you
hear
him
you
hear
him
exclaimed
baudu
delighted
there
one
whom
they
never
get
hold
of
ah
my
boy
you
the
last
of
the
old
stock
we
sha
see
any
more
but
geneviève
with
her
severe
and
suffering
look
did
not
take
her
eyes
off
colomban
but
dived
into
the
depths
of
his
heart
and
he
felt
troubled
and
again
launched
out
into
invective
madame
baudu
was
watching
them
in
silence
with
an
anxious
air
as
if
she
foresaw
another
misfortune
in
this
direction
for
some
time
past
her
daughter
sadness
had
frightened
her
she
felt
her
to
be
dying
the
shop
is
left
to
take
care
of
itself
she
said
at
last
rising
from
table
in
order
to
put
an
end
to
the
scene
go
and
see
colomban
i
fancy
i
heard
some
one
they
had
finished
and
got
up
baudu
and
colomban
went
to
speak
to
a
traveller
who
had
come
for
orders
madame
baudu
carried
pépé
off
to
show
him
some
pictures
the
servant
had
quickly
cleared
the
table
and
denise
was
lingering
by
the
window
looking
curiously
into
the
little
when
on
turning
round
she
saw
geneviève
still
in
her
place
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
american
cloth
which
was
still
damp
from
the
sponge
that
had
been
passed
over
it
are
you
suffering
cousin
she
asked
the
young
girl
did
not
reply
but
seemed
to
be
obstinately
studying
a
rent
in
the
cloth
though
really
absorbed
in
the
reflections
passing
through
her
mind
but
after
a
while
she
raised
her
head
with
difficulty
and
looked
at
the
sympathizing
face
bent
over
hers
the
others
had
gone
then
what
was
she
doing
on
that
chair
and
suddenly
sobs
stifled
her
her
head
fell
forward
on
the
edge
of
the
table
she
wept
on
wetting
her
sleeve
with
her
tears
good
heavens
what
the
matter
with
you
cried
denise
in
dismay
shall
i
call
some
one
but
geneviève
nervously
caught
her
by
the
arm
and
held
her
back
stammering
no
no
stay
here
do
let
mamma
know
with
you
i
mind
but
not
the
others
not
the
others
it
not
my
fault
i
assure
you
it
was
on
finding
myself
all
alone
wait
a
bit
i
better
not
crying
now
nevertheless
sudden
attacks
kept
on
seizing
her
sending
shudders
through
her
frail
body
it
seemed
as
though
her
pile
of
hair
was
weighing
down
her
neck
while
she
was
rolling
her
head
on
her
folded
arms
a
slipped
out
and
then
her
hair
fell
over
her
neck
burying
it
beneath
gloomy
tresses
denise
as
quietly
as
possible
for
fear
of
attracting
attention
sought
to
console
her
she
undid
her
dress
and
was
on
seeing
how
fearfully
thin
she
had
become
the
poor
girl
bosom
was
as
hollow
as
a
child
then
denise
took
hold
of
her
hair
by
the
handful
that
superb
hair
which
seemed
to
be
absorbing
all
her
life
and
twisted
it
up
tightly
to
clear
her
neck
and
make
her
cooler
thanks
you
are
very
kind
said
geneviève
ah
i
not
stout
am
i
i
used
to
be
stouter
but
it
all
gone
away
do
up
my
dress
or
mamma
might
see
my
shoulders
i
hide
them
as
much
as
i
can
good
heavens
not
at
all
well
i
not
at
all
well
however
the
attack
passed
away
and
she
sat
there
completely
exhausted
and
looking
fixedly
at
her
cousin
after
a
pause
she
abruptly
inquired
tell
me
the
truth
does
he
love
her
denise
felt
a
blush
rising
to
her
cheeks
she
was
perfectly
well
aware
that
geneviève
referred
to
colomban
and
clara
but
she
pretended
to
be
surprised
who
dear
geneviève
shook
her
head
with
an
incredulous
air
do
tell
falsehoods
i
beg
of
you
do
me
the
favour
of
setting
my
doubts
at
rest
you
must
know
i
feel
it
yes
you
were
that
girl
comrade
and
i
seen
colomban
run
after
you
and
talk
to
you
in
a
low
voice
he
was
giving
you
messages
for
her
was
he
oh
for
pity
sake
tell
me
the
truth
i
assure
you
it
will
do
me
good
never
before
had
denise
been
in
such
an
awkward
position
she
lowered
her
eyes
before
this
girl
who
was
ever
silent
and
yet
guessed
all
however
she
had
the
strength
to
deceive
her
still
but
it
you
he
loves
she
said
geneviève
made
a
gesture
of
despair
very
well
you
wo
tell
me
anything
however
i
do
care
i
seen
them
he
continually
going
outside
to
look
at
her
she
upstairs
laughs
like
a
bad
woman
of
course
they
meet
out
of
doors
as
for
that
no
i
assure
you
exclaimed
denise
forgetting
herself
and
carried
away
by
the
desire
to
give
her
cousin
at
least
that
consolation
geneviève
drew
a
long
breath
and
smiled
feebly
then
in
the
weak
voice
of
a
convalescent
she
said
i
should
like
a
glass
of
water
excuse
me
if
i
trouble
you
look
over
there
in
the
sideboard
when
she
got
hold
of
the
bottle
she
drank
a
large
glassful
right
off
keeping
denise
away
with
one
hand
the
young
saleswoman
was
afraid
that
she
might
do
herself
harm
no
no
said
she
let
me
be
i
always
thirsty
in
the
night
i
get
up
to
drink
silence
again
fell
then
geneviève
once
more
began
in
a
gentle
voice
if
you
only
knew
i
been
accustomed
to
the
idea
of
this
marriage
for
the
last
ten
years
i
was
still
wearing
short
dresses
when
colomban
began
courting
me
i
can
hardly
remember
how
things
came
about
by
always
living
together
shut
up
here
together
without
any
other
distractions
between
us
i
must
have
ended
by
believing
him
to
be
my
husband
before
he
really
was
i
did
know
whether
i
loved
him
i
was
his
wife
that
was
all
and
now
he
wants
to
go
off
with
another
girl
oh
heavens
my
heart
is
breaking
you
see
it
a
grief
that
i
never
felt
before
it
hurts
me
in
the
bosom
and
in
the
head
then
it
spreads
everywhere
it
killing
me
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
denise
whose
eyelids
were
also
moistening
with
pity
asked
her
does
my
aunt
suspect
anything
yes
mamma
has
her
suspicions
i
think
as
for
papa
he
is
too
much
worried
and
does
not
know
the
pain
he
is
causing
me
by
postponing
the
marriage
mamma
has
questioned
me
several
times
greatly
alarmed
to
see
me
pining
away
she
has
never
been
very
strong
herself
and
has
often
said
to
me
poor
child
you
like
myself
by
no
means
strong
besides
one
does
grow
much
in
these
shops
but
she
must
find
me
getting
really
too
thin
now
look
at
my
arms
would
you
believe
it
then
with
a
trembling
hand
she
again
took
up
the
water
bottle
her
cousin
tried
to
prevent
her
from
drinking
but
i
so
thirsty
said
she
let
me
drink
they
could
hear
baudu
talking
in
a
loud
voice
then
suddenly
yielding
to
an
inspiration
of
her
heart
denise
knelt
down
before
geneviève
and
throwing
her
sisterly
arms
round
her
neck
kissed
her
and
assured
her
that
everything
would
yet
turn
out
all
right
that
she
would
marry
colomban
would
get
well
and
live
happily
and
then
she
got
up
quickly
for
her
uncle
was
calling
her
jean
is
here
come
along
it
was
indeed
jean
who
looking
rather
scared
had
just
arrived
for
dinner
when
they
told
him
it
was
striking
eight
he
seemed
amazed
impossible
he
had
only
just
left
his
master
they
chaffed
him
no
doubt
he
had
come
by
way
of
the
bois
de
vincennes
but
as
soon
as
he
could
get
near
his
sister
he
whispered
to
her
it
all
the
fault
of
a
little
i
got
a
cab
outside
by
the
hour
give
me
five
francs
he
went
out
for
a
minute
and
then
returned
to
dinner
for
madame
baudu
would
not
hear
of
his
going
away
without
taking
at
least
a
plate
of
soup
geneviève
had
returned
to
the
shop
in
her
usual
silent
and
retiring
manner
colomban
was
now
half
asleep
behind
the
counter
and
the
evening
passed
away
slow
and
melancholy
only
animated
by
tramp
as
he
walked
from
one
end
of
the
empty
shop
to
the
other
a
single
was
alight
the
shadows
of
the
low
ceiling
fell
in
large
masses
like
black
earth
from
a
ditch
several
months
passed
away
denise
came
in
nearly
every
evening
to
cheer
up
geneviève
a
bit
but
the
baudus
home
became
more
melancholy
than
ever
the
works
opposite
were
a
continual
torment
which
made
them
feel
their
bad
luck
more
and
more
keenly
even
when
they
had
an
hour
of
hope
some
unexpected
joy
the
uproar
of
a
of
bricks
the
sound
of
a
saw
or
the
simple
call
of
a
mason
would
at
once
suffice
to
mar
their
pleasure
in
fact
the
whole
neighbourhood
was
stirred
by
it
all
from
behind
the
hoarding
edging
and
obstructing
the
three
streets
there
issued
a
movement
of
feverish
activity
although
the
architect
was
utilizing
the
existing
buildings
he
was
opening
them
in
various
ways
to
adapt
them
to
their
new
uses
and
right
in
the
centre
of
the
vacant
space
supplied
by
the
he
was
building
a
central
gallery
as
vast
as
a
church
which
would
be
reached
by
a
grand
entrance
in
the
rue
in
the
very
middle
of
the
frontage
they
had
at
first
experienced
great
difficulty
in
laying
the
foundations
for
they
had
come
upon
sewer
deposits
and
loose
earth
full
of
human
bones
besides
which
the
boring
of
the
well
a
well
three
hundred
feet
deep
destined
to
yield
two
hundred
gallons
a
minute
had
made
the
neighbours
very
anxious
they
had
now
got
the
walls
up
to
the
first
storey
and
the
entire
block
was
surrounded
by
scaffoldings
regular
towers
of
timber
there
was
an
incessant
noise
from
the
grinding
of
the
windlasses
hoisting
up
the
the
abrupt
unloading
of
iron
bars
the
clamour
of
the
army
of
workmen
accompanied
by
the
noise
of
picks
and
hammers
but
above
all
else
what
most
deafened
you
was
the
sound
of
the
machinery
everything
went
by
steam
screeching
whistles
rent
the
air
and
then
too
at
the
slightest
gust
of
wind
clouds
of
plaster
flew
about
and
covered
the
neighbouring
roofs
like
a
fall
of
snow
the
despairing
baudus
looked
on
at
this
implacable
dust
penetrating
everywhere
filtering
through
the
closest
woodwork
soiling
the
goods
in
their
shop
even
gliding
into
their
beds
and
the
idea
that
they
must
continue
to
breathe
it
that
it
would
end
by
killing
them
empoisoned
their
existence
the
situation
however
was
destined
to
become
worse
still
for
in
september
the
architect
afraid
of
not
being
ready
in
time
decided
to
carry
on
the
work
at
night
also
powerful
electric
lamps
were
established
and
then
the
uproar
became
continuous
gangs
of
men
relieved
each
other
the
hammers
never
stopped
the
engines
whistled
night
and
day
and
again
the
everlasting
clamour
seemed
to
raise
and
scatter
the
white
dust
the
exasperated
baudus
now
had
to
give
up
the
idea
of
sleeping
even
they
were
shaken
in
their
alcove
the
noises
changed
into
nightmare
whenever
they
managed
to
doze
off
then
if
they
got
up
to
calm
their
fever
and
went
with
bare
feet
to
pull
back
the
curtains
and
look
out
of
the
window
they
were
frightened
by
the
vision
of
the
ladies
paradise
flaring
in
the
darkness
like
a
colossal
forge
where
their
ruin
was
being
forged
along
the
walls
pierced
with
empty
bays
the
electric
lamps
threw
broad
bluey
rays
of
blinding
intensity
two
struck
then
three
then
four
and
during
the
painful
sleep
of
the
neighbourhood
the
works
expanding
in
the
brightness
became
colossal
and
fantastic
swarming
with
black
shadows
noisy
workmen
whose
silhouettes
gesticulated
against
the
crude
whiteness
of
the
new
walls
baudu
had
spoken
correctly
the
small
traders
of
the
adjacent
streets
were
receiving
another
mortal
blow
every
time
the
ladies
paradise
created
new
departments
there
were
fresh
failures
among
the
shopkeepers
of
the
district
the
disaster
spread
one
could
hear
the
oldest
houses
cracking
mademoiselle
tatin
of
the
shop
in
the
passage
choiseul
had
just
been
declared
bankrupt
quinette
the
glover
could
hardly
hold
out
another
six
months
the
furriers
vanpouille
were
obliged
to
a
part
of
their
premises
and
if
the
bédorés
brother
and
sister
still
kept
on
as
hosiers
in
the
rue
gaillon
they
were
evidently
living
on
the
money
they
had
formerly
saved
and
now
more
smashes
were
on
the
point
of
being
added
to
those
long
since
foreseen
the
fancy
goods
department
threatened
a
dealer
in
the
rue
deslignières
a
big
man
whilst
the
furniture
department
was
injuring
piot
and
rivoire
whose
shops
slumbered
in
the
gloom
of
the
passage
it
was
even
feared
that
an
attack
of
apoplexy
would
carry
off
deslignières
who
had
been
in
a
terrible
rage
ever
since
the
ladies
paradise
had
marked
up
purses
at
thirty
per
cent
reduction
the
furniture
dealers
who
were
much
calmer
affected
to
joke
at
these
who
wanted
to
meddle
with
such
articles
as
chairs
and
tables
but
customers
were
already
leaving
them
and
the
success
of
mouret
department
threatened
to
be
a
formidable
one
it
was
all
over
they
must
bow
their
heads
after
these
others
would
be
swept
off
in
their
turn
and
there
was
no
reason
why
every
business
should
not
be
driven
away
some
day
the
paradise
alone
would
cover
the
neighbourhood
with
its
roof
at
present
when
the
thousand
employees
went
in
and
came
out
morning
and
evening
they
formed
such
a
long
procession
on
the
place
gaillon
that
people
stopped
to
look
at
them
as
they
might
at
a
passing
regiment
for
ten
minutes
they
blocked
up
all
the
streets
and
the
shopkeepers
standing
at
their
doors
thought
bitterly
of
their
one
assistant
whom
they
hardly
knew
how
to
find
food
for
the
last
of
the
big
bazaar
the
of
forty
millions
had
also
revolutionized
the
neighbourhood
the
figure
passed
from
house
to
house
amid
cries
of
surprise
and
anger
forty
millions
think
of
that
no
doubt
the
net
profit
did
not
exceed
more
than
four
per
given
the
heavy
general
expenses
and
the
system
of
low
prices
but
sixteen
hundred
thousand
francs
was
still
a
handsome
sum
one
could
well
be
satisfied
with
four
per
when
one
operated
on
such
a
scale
as
that
it
was
said
that
mouret
starting
capital
of
five
hundred
thousand
francs
each
year
increased
by
the
total
profits
of
the
house
a
capital
which
must
at
that
moment
have
amounted
to
four
millions
had
in
one
twelvemonth
passed
ten
times
over
the
counters
in
the
form
of
goods
robineau
when
he
made
this
calculation
in
denise
presence
one
evening
after
dinner
was
quite
overcome
for
a
moment
and
remained
staring
at
his
empty
plate
she
was
right
it
was
this
incessant
renewal
of
capital
that
constituted
the
invincible
power
of
the
new
system
of
business
bourras
alone
denied
the
facts
refusing
to
understand
superb
and
stupid
as
a
milestone
to
him
the
paradise
people
were
a
pack
of
thieves
and
nothing
more
a
lying
set
who
would
be
picked
out
of
the
gutter
some
fine
morning
the
baudus
however
despite
their
determination
not
to
change
anything
in
the
system
of
the
old
elbeuf
tried
to
sustain
the
competition
customers
no
longer
coming
to
them
they
sought
to
reach
the
customers
through
the
agency
of
travellers
there
was
at
that
time
in
the
paris
market
a
traveller
connected
with
all
the
leading
tailors
who
saved
the
little
cloth
and
flannel
houses
when
he
condescended
to
represent
them
naturally
they
all
tried
to
get
hold
of
him
he
was
quite
a
personage
and
baudu
having
haggled
with
him
had
the
misfortune
to
see
him
come
to
terms
with
the
matignons
of
the
rue
then
one
after
the
other
two
other
travellers
robbed
him
a
third
an
honest
man
did
no
business
it
was
a
slow
death
exempt
from
shocks
a
continual
decrease
of
business
customers
falling
away
one
by
one
a
day
came
when
the
bills
to
be
met
fell
on
the
baudus
very
heavily
until
that
time
they
had
lived
on
their
former
savings
but
now
they
began
to
contract
debts
in
december
baudu
terrified
by
the
amount
of
his
acceptances
resigned
himself
to
a
most
cruel
sacrifice
he
sold
his
at
rambouillet
a
house
which
cost
him
a
lot
of
money
in
continual
repairs
and
whose
tenants
had
not
even
paid
the
rent
when
he
decided
to
get
rid
of
it
this
sale
killed
the
sole
dream
of
his
life
his
heart
bled
as
for
the
loss
of
some
dear
one
and
for
seventy
thousand
francs
he
had
to
part
with
what
had
cost
him
more
than
two
hundred
thousand
considering
himself
fortunate
even
in
meeting
the
lhommes
his
neighbours
who
were
desirous
of
adding
to
their
property
those
seventy
thousand
francs
would
keep
the
business
going
a
little
longer
for
in
spite
of
all
the
repulses
the
idea
of
struggling
on
ever
sprang
up
again
perhaps
with
great
care
they
might
conquer
even
now
on
the
sunday
on
which
the
lhommes
paid
the
money
they
condescended
to
dine
at
the
old
elbeuf
madame
aurélie
was
the
first
to
arrive
they
had
to
wait
for
the
cashier
who
came
late
scared
by
a
whole
afternoon
music
as
for
young
albert
he
had
accepted
the
invitation
but
did
not
put
in
an
appearance
it
was
moreover
a
painful
evening
the
baudus
living
without
air
in
their
tiny
suffered
from
the
breeze
which
the
lhommes
with
their
lack
of
family
ties
and
their
taste
for
a
free
life
brought
in
with
them
geneviève
wounded
by
madame
aurélie
imperial
airs
did
not
open
her
mouth
but
colomban
admired
her
with
a
shiver
on
reflecting
that
she
reigned
over
clara
later
on
when
madame
baudu
was
already
in
bed
her
husband
remained
for
a
long
time
walking
about
the
room
it
was
a
mild
night
damp
thawing
weather
and
in
spite
of
the
closed
windows
and
drawn
curtains
one
could
hear
the
engines
snorting
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
do
you
know
what
i
thinking
of
elisabeth
said
baudu
at
last
well
those
lhommes
may
earn
as
much
money
as
they
like
i
rather
be
in
my
shoes
than
theirs
they
get
on
well
it
true
the
wife
said
did
she
that
she
had
made
nearly
twenty
thousand
francs
this
year
and
that
had
enabled
her
to
take
my
poor
house
never
mind
i
no
longer
got
the
house
but
i
do
go
playing
music
in
one
direction
whilst
you
are
gadding
about
in
the
other
no
look
you
they
ca
be
happy
he
was
still
keenly
fretting
over
the
sacrifice
he
had
been
compelled
to
make
full
of
rancour
against
those
people
who
had
bought
up
his
darling
dream
when
ever
he
came
near
the
bed
he
leant
over
his
wife
and
gesticulated
then
returning
to
the
window
he
stood
silent
for
a
minute
listening
to
the
noise
of
the
works
and
again
he
vented
his
old
accusations
his
despairing
complaints
about
the
new
times
nobody
had
ever
seen
such
things
now
earned
more
than
tradesmen
cashiers
bought
up
employers
property
so
no
wonder
that
everything
was
going
to
the
dogs
family
ties
no
longer
existed
people
lived
at
hotels
instead
of
eating
their
meals
at
home
in
a
respectable
manner
at
last
he
ended
by
prophesying
that
young
albert
would
swallow
up
the
rambouillet
property
later
on
with
a
lot
of
actresses
madame
baudu
listened
to
him
her
head
flat
on
the
pillow
and
so
pale
that
her
face
seemed
the
colour
of
the
sheets
they
paid
you
she
at
length
said
softly
at
this
baudu
became
dumb
he
walked
about
for
an
instant
with
his
eyes
on
the
ground
then
he
resumed
they
paid
me
is
true
and
after
all
their
money
is
as
good
as
another
it
would
be
funny
if
we
revived
the
business
with
this
money
ah
if
i
were
not
so
old
and
worn
out
a
long
silence
ensued
the
draper
was
full
of
vague
projects
suddenly
without
moving
her
head
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
ceiling
his
wife
spoke
again
have
you
noticed
your
daughter
lately
no
he
replied
well
she
makes
me
rather
anxious
she
getting
pale
she
seems
to
be
pining
away
he
stood
before
the
bed
full
of
surprise
really
whatever
for
if
she
ill
she
should
say
so
we
must
send
for
the
doctor
madame
baudu
still
remained
motionless
but
after
a
time
she
declared
with
her
meditative
air
i
think
it
would
be
better
to
get
this
marriage
with
colomban
over
he
looked
at
her
and
then
began
walking
about
again
certain
things
came
back
to
his
mind
was
it
possible
that
his
daughter
was
falling
ill
over
the
shopman
did
she
love
him
so
much
that
she
could
not
wait
here
was
another
misfortune
it
worried
him
all
the
more
from
the
circumstance
that
he
himself
had
fixed
ideas
about
this
marriage
he
could
never
consent
to
it
in
the
present
state
of
affairs
however
his
anxiety
softened
him
very
good
said
he
at
last
i
speak
to
colomban
and
without
adding
another
word
he
continued
his
walk
soon
afterwards
his
wife
fell
asleep
still
looking
quite
white
as
if
dead
while
he
still
kept
on
tramping
about
before
getting
into
bed
he
drew
aside
the
curtains
and
glanced
outside
across
the
street
through
the
gaping
windows
of
the
old
hôtel
duvillard
the
workmen
could
be
seen
stirring
in
the
dazzling
glare
of
the
electric
light
on
the
following
morning
baudu
took
colomban
to
the
further
end
of
the
on
the
upper
floor
having
made
up
his
mind
over
night
as
to
what
he
would
say
to
him
my
boy
he
began
you
know
i
sold
my
property
at
rambouillet
that
will
enable
us
to
show
some
fight
but
i
should
first
of
all
like
to
have
a
talk
with
you
the
young
man
who
seemed
to
dread
the
interview
waited
with
an
awkward
air
his
small
eyes
twinkled
in
his
broad
face
and
he
stood
there
with
his
mouth
open
with
him
a
sign
of
profound
agitation
just
listen
to
me
resumed
the
draper
when
old
hauchecorne
left
me
the
old
elbeuf
the
house
was
prosperous
he
himself
had
received
it
from
old
finet
in
a
satisfactory
state
you
know
my
ideas
i
should
consider
it
wrong
if
i
passed
this
family
trust
over
to
my
children
in
a
diminished
state
and
that
why
i
always
postponed
your
marriage
with
geneviève
yes
i
was
obstinate
i
hoped
to
bring
back
our
former
prosperity
i
wanted
to
hand
you
the
books
saying
here
the
year
i
commenced
we
sold
so
much
cloth
and
this
year
the
year
i
retire
we
have
sold
ten
thousand
or
twenty
thousand
francs
worth
more
in
short
you
understand
it
was
a
vow
i
made
to
myself
the
very
natural
desire
i
had
to
prove
that
the
house
had
not
declined
in
my
hands
otherwise
it
would
seem
to
me
that
i
was
robbing
you
his
voice
became
husky
with
emotion
he
blew
his
nose
to
recover
himself
a
bit
and
then
asked
you
do
say
anything
but
colomban
had
nothing
to
say
he
shook
his
head
and
waited
feeling
more
and
more
perturbed
and
fancying
that
he
could
guess
what
the
governor
was
aiming
at
it
was
the
marriage
without
further
delay
how
could
he
refuse
he
would
never
have
the
strength
to
do
so
and
yet
there
was
that
other
girl
of
whom
he
dreamed
at
night
devoured
by
insensate
passion
now
continued
baudu
a
sum
of
money
has
come
in
that
may
save
us
the
situation
becomes
worse
every
day
but
perhaps
by
making
a
supreme
in
short
i
thought
it
right
to
warn
you
we
are
going
to
venture
our
last
stake
if
we
are
beaten
why
that
will
entirely
ruin
us
only
my
poor
boy
your
marriage
must
again
be
postponed
for
i
do
wish
to
throw
you
two
all
alone
into
the
struggle
that
would
be
too
cowardly
would
it
colomban
greatly
relieved
had
seated
himself
on
a
pile
of
molleton
his
legs
were
still
trembling
he
was
afraid
of
showing
his
delight
so
he
held
down
his
head
whilst
rolling
his
fingers
on
his
knees
you
do
say
anything
repeated
baudu
no
he
said
nothing
he
could
find
nothing
to
say
thereupon
the
draper
slowly
resumed
i
was
sure
this
would
grieve
you
you
must
muster
up
courage
pull
yourself
together
a
bit
do
let
yourself
be
crushed
in
this
way
above
all
understand
my
position
can
i
hang
such
a
weight
about
your
neck
instead
of
leaving
you
a
good
business
i
should
leave
you
a
bankruptcy
perhaps
no
only
scoundrels
play
such
tricks
as
that
no
doubt
i
desire
nothing
but
your
happiness
but
nobody
shall
ever
make
me
go
against
my
conscience
and
he
went
on
for
a
long
time
in
this
way
meandering
through
a
maze
of
contradictory
sentences
like
a
man
who
would
have
liked
to
be
understood
at
the
first
word
but
finds
himself
obliged
to
explain
everything
as
he
had
promised
his
daughter
and
the
shop
strict
probity
forced
him
to
deliver
both
in
good
condition
without
defects
or
debts
but
he
was
weary
the
burden
seemed
to
be
too
much
for
him
and
entreaty
almost
pierced
though
his
stammering
accents
at
last
he
got
more
entangled
than
ever
awaiting
some
sudden
impulse
from
colomban
some
heartfelt
cry
which
did
not
come
i
know
he
murmured
that
old
men
are
wanting
in
ardour
with
young
ones
things
light
up
they
are
full
of
fire
it
only
natural
but
no
no
i
ca
my
word
of
honour
if
i
gave
it
up
to
you
you
would
blame
me
later
on
he
stopped
trembling
and
as
the
young
man
still
kept
his
head
down
he
asked
him
for
the
third
time
after
a
painful
silence
you
say
anything
then
at
last
without
venturing
to
look
at
him
colomban
replied
there
nothing
to
say
you
are
the
master
you
know
better
than
all
of
us
as
you
wish
it
we
wait
we
try
and
be
reasonable
it
was
all
over
baudu
still
hoped
he
was
going
to
throw
himself
into
his
arms
exclaiming
father
do
you
take
a
rest
we
fight
in
our
turn
give
us
the
shop
as
it
is
so
that
we
may
work
a
miracle
and
save
it
then
however
he
looked
at
him
and
felt
full
of
shame
reproaching
himself
for
having
wished
to
dupe
his
children
his
maniacal
commercial
honesty
was
awakened
in
him
it
was
this
prudent
fellow
who
was
right
for
there
is
no
such
thing
as
sentiment
in
business
which
is
only
a
question
of
figures
embrace
me
my
boy
he
said
in
conclusion
it
settled
we
speak
about
the
marriage
for
another
year
one
must
think
of
the
business
before
everything
that
evening
in
their
room
when
madame
baudu
questioned
her
husband
as
to
the
result
of
the
conversation
the
draper
had
regained
his
obstinate
resolve
to
fight
on
in
person
to
the
bitter
end
he
gave
colomban
high
praise
calling
him
a
solid
fellow
firm
in
his
ideas
brought
up
in
the
best
principles
incapable
for
instance
of
joking
with
the
customers
like
those
puppies
at
the
paradise
no
he
was
honest
he
belonged
to
the
family
he
did
speculate
on
the
business
as
though
he
were
a
well
then
when
the
marriage
to
take
place
asked
madame
baudu
later
on
he
replied
when
i
am
able
to
keep
my
promises
she
made
no
gestures
but
simply
remarked
it
will
be
our
death
baudu
restrained
himself
though
hot
with
anger
he
was
the
one
whom
it
would
kill
if
they
continually
upset
him
like
this
was
it
his
fault
he
loved
his
daughter
would
lay
down
his
life
for
her
but
he
could
not
make
the
business
prosper
when
it
obstinately
refused
to
do
so
geneviève
ought
to
have
a
little
more
sense
and
wait
patiently
for
a
better
balance
the
deuce
colomban
would
always
be
there
no
one
would
run
away
with
him
it
incredible
he
repeated
such
a
girl
madame
baudu
said
no
more
she
had
doubtless
guessed
jealous
agony
but
she
did
not
dare
to
inform
her
husband
of
it
a
singular
womanly
modesty
always
prevented
her
from
approaching
certain
tender
delicate
subjects
with
him
when
he
saw
her
so
silent
he
turned
his
anger
against
the
people
opposite
stretching
out
his
fists
towards
the
works
where
they
were
that
night
setting
up
some
large
iron
girders
with
a
great
noise
of
hammers
denise
had
now
decided
to
return
to
the
ladies
paradise
having
understood
that
the
robineaus
obliged
to
cut
down
their
staff
were
at
a
loss
how
to
dismiss
her
to
maintain
their
position
they
were
now
obliged
to
do
everything
themselves
gaujean
still
obstinate
in
his
rancour
renewed
their
bills
and
even
promised
to
find
them
funds
but
they
were
frightened
they
wanted
to
try
the
effect
of
economy
and
order
during
a
whole
fortnight
denise
had
felt
that
they
were
embarrassed
about
her
and
it
was
she
who
spoke
the
first
saying
that
she
had
found
a
situation
elsewhere
this
came
as
a
great
relief
madame
robineau
embraced
her
deeply
affected
and
declaring
that
she
should
always
miss
her
then
when
in
answer
to
a
question
the
young
girl
acknowledged
that
she
was
going
back
to
mouret
robineau
turned
pale
you
are
right
he
exclaimed
violently
it
was
not
so
easy
to
tell
the
news
to
old
bourras
however
still
denise
had
to
give
him
notice
and
she
trembled
at
the
thought
for
she
felt
full
of
gratitude
towards
him
bourras
was
at
this
time
in
a
rage
from
morn
till
night
for
he
more
than
any
other
suffered
from
the
uproar
of
the
adjacent
works
the
builder
carts
blocked
up
his
doorway
the
picks
tapped
on
his
walls
umbrellas
and
sticks
everything
in
his
place
danced
about
to
the
noise
of
the
hammers
it
seemed
as
if
the
hovel
obstinately
remaining
in
the
midst
of
these
demolitions
would
suddenly
split
to
pieces
but
the
worst
was
that
the
architect
in
order
to
connect
the
existing
shops
with
those
about
to
be
opened
in
the
hôtel
duvillard
had
conceived
the
idea
of
tunnelling
a
passage
under
the
little
house
that
separated
them
this
house
now
belonged
to
the
firm
of
mouret
and
as
the
lease
stipulated
that
the
tenant
should
submit
to
all
necessary
repairs
the
workmen
one
morning
appeared
on
the
scene
at
this
bourras
nearly
went
into
a
fit
was
it
enough
that
they
should
grip
him
on
all
sides
on
the
right
the
left
and
behind
without
attacking
him
underfoot
as
well
taking
the
very
ground
from
under
him
and
he
drove
the
masons
away
and
went
to
law
repairs
yes
but
this
was
a
work
of
embellishment
the
neighbourhood
thought
he
would
win
the
day
without
however
being
sure
of
anything
the
case
at
any
rate
threatened
to
be
a
long
one
and
people
became
quite
impassioned
over
this
interminable
duel
on
the
day
when
denise
at
last
resolved
to
give
him
notice
bourras
had
just
returned
from
his
lawyer
would
you
believe
it
he
exclaimed
they
now
say
that
the
house
is
not
solid
they
pretend
that
the
foundations
must
be
strengthened
confound
it
they
have
shaken
it
up
so
much
with
their
infernal
machines
that
it
is
astonishing
if
it
gives
way
then
when
the
girl
announced
she
was
going
to
leave
and
was
returning
to
the
ladies
paradise
at
a
salary
of
a
thousand
francs
he
became
so
amazed
that
he
could
only
raise
his
trembling
hands
in
the
air
emotion
made
him
drop
upon
a
chair
you
you
he
stammered
ah
i
the
only
one
i
the
only
one
left
and
after
a
pause
he
asked
and
the
youngster
he
go
back
to
madame
gras
replied
denise
she
was
very
fond
of
him
they
again
became
silent
she
would
have
rather
seen
him
furious
swearing
and
banging
the
counter
with
his
fist
the
sight
of
this
old
man
suffocating
and
crushed
made
her
heart
bleed
but
he
gradually
recovered
and
began
shouting
out
once
more
a
thousand
francs
that
is
to
be
refused
you
all
go
go
then
leave
me
here
alone
yes
alone
you
understand
one
at
all
events
will
never
bow
his
head
and
tell
them
i
win
my
lawsuit
if
i
have
to
sell
my
last
shirt
for
it
denise
was
not
to
leave
robineau
till
the
end
of
the
month
she
had
seen
mouret
again
and
everything
had
been
settled
one
evening
as
she
was
going
up
to
her
room
deloche
who
was
watching
for
her
in
a
doorway
stopped
her
he
was
delighted
having
just
heard
the
good
news
they
were
all
talking
about
it
in
the
shop
said
he
and
he
gaily
told
her
of
all
the
gossip
at
the
counters
the
young
ladies
in
the
mantle
department
are
pulling
fearfully
long
faces
you
know
and
then
breaking
off
he
added
by
the
way
you
remember
clara
prunaire
well
it
appears
the
governor
has
taken
a
fancy
to
her
he
had
turned
quite
red
she
very
pale
exclaimed
what
monsieur
mouret
funny
taste
eh
he
resumed
a
woman
who
looks
like
a
horse
however
that
his
business
once
upstairs
denise
almost
fainted
away
it
was
surely
through
coming
up
too
quickly
leaning
out
of
the
window
she
had
a
sudden
vision
of
valognes
the
deserted
street
and
grassy
pavement
which
she
had
seen
from
her
room
as
a
child
and
she
was
seized
with
a
desire
to
go
and
live
there
once
more
to
seek
refuge
in
the
peace
and
forgetfulness
of
the
country
paris
irritated
her
she
hated
the
ladies
paradise
she
no
longer
knew
why
she
had
consented
to
go
back
she
would
certainly
suffer
there
as
much
as
formerly
she
was
already
suffering
from
an
unknown
uneasiness
since
deloche
stories
and
then
all
at
once
a
flood
of
tears
forced
her
to
leave
the
window
she
continued
weeping
on
for
some
time
but
at
last
found
a
little
courage
to
live
on
still
the
next
day
at
lunch
time
as
robineau
had
sent
her
on
an
errand
and
she
was
passing
the
old
elbeuf
she
opened
the
door
on
seeing
colomban
alone
in
the
shop
the
baudus
were
having
their
meal
she
could
hear
the
clatter
of
the
knives
and
forks
in
the
little
you
can
come
in
said
the
shopman
they
are
at
table
but
she
motioned
him
to
be
silent
and
drew
him
into
a
corner
then
lowering
her
voice
she
said
it
you
i
want
to
speak
to
have
you
no
heart
ca
you
see
that
geneviève
loves
you
and
that
it
killing
her
she
was
trembling
her
fever
of
the
previous
night
had
taken
possession
of
her
again
he
frightened
and
surprised
by
this
sudden
attack
stood
looking
at
her
without
a
word
do
you
hear
she
continued
geneviève
knows
you
love
another
she
told
me
so
she
wept
like
a
child
ah
poor
girl
she
is
very
strong
now
i
can
tell
you
if
you
had
seen
her
thin
arms
you
ca
leave
her
to
die
like
this
at
last
he
spoke
quite
overcome
but
she
is
ill
you
exaggerate
i
do
see
anything
myself
besides
it
her
father
who
is
postponing
the
marriage
denise
sharply
corrected
this
falsehood
certain
as
she
was
that
the
least
insistence
on
the
young
man
part
would
have
decided
her
uncle
as
for
colomban
surprise
however
it
was
not
feigned
he
had
really
never
noticed
geneviève
slow
agony
for
him
it
was
a
very
disagreeable
revelation
for
while
he
remained
ignorant
of
it
he
had
no
great
blame
to
tax
himself
with
and
who
for
indeed
resumed
denise
for
an
utterly
worthless
girl
you
ca
know
whom
you
are
loving
so
far
i
have
not
wished
to
hurt
your
feelings
i
have
often
avoided
answering
your
continual
questions
well
she
goes
about
with
everybody
she
laughs
at
you
and
will
never
marry
you
he
listened
to
her
turning
very
pale
and
at
each
of
the
sentences
she
threw
in
his
face
his
lips
quivered
she
in
a
cruel
fit
yielded
to
a
transport
of
anger
of
which
she
had
no
consciousness
in
short
she
said
in
a
final
cry
she
monsieur
mouret
mistress
if
you
want
to
know
as
she
spoke
her
voice
died
away
in
her
throat
and
she
turned
even
paler
than
colomban
himself
both
stood
looking
at
each
other
then
he
stammered
out
i
love
her
denise
felt
ashamed
of
herself
why
was
she
talking
in
this
fashion
to
this
young
fellow
why
was
she
getting
so
excited
she
stood
there
mute
the
simple
reply
which
he
had
just
given
her
resounded
in
her
heart
like
the
distant
but
deafening
clang
of
a
bell
i
love
her
i
love
her
and
it
seemed
to
spread
he
was
right
he
could
not
marry
another
woman
and
as
she
turned
round
she
observed
geneviève
on
the
threshold
of
the
be
quiet
she
said
rapidly
but
it
was
too
late
geneviève
must
have
heard
for
her
face
was
white
and
bloodless
just
at
that
moment
a
customer
opened
the
door
madame
bourdelais
one
of
the
last
faithful
customers
of
the
old
elbeuf
where
she
found
substantial
goods
for
her
money
for
a
long
time
past
madame
de
boves
had
followed
the
fashion
and
gone
over
to
the
paradise
madame
marty
also
no
longer
came
being
entirely
subjugated
by
the
fascinations
of
the
display
opposite
and
geneviève
was
forced
to
come
forward
and
inquire
in
her
weak
voice
what
do
you
desire
madame
madame
bourdelais
wished
to
see
some
flannel
colomban
took
down
a
roll
from
a
shelf
geneviève
showed
the
stuff
and
once
again
the
young
people
found
themselves
close
together
behind
the
counter
meanwhile
baudu
came
out
of
the
behind
his
wife
who
went
to
seat
herself
at
the
at
first
he
did
not
meddle
with
the
sale
but
after
smiling
at
denise
stood
there
looking
at
madame
bourdelais
it
is
not
good
enough
said
the
latter
show
me
the
thickest
you
have
colomban
took
down
another
bundle
there
was
a
silence
madame
bourdelais
examined
the
stuff
how
much
she
asked
six
francs
madame
replied
geneviève
the
lady
made
an
abrupt
gesture
six
francs
said
she
but
they
have
the
same
opposite
at
five
francs
a
slight
contraction
passed
over
baudu
face
he
could
not
help
interfering
politely
no
doubt
madame
made
a
mistake
indeed
the
stuff
ought
to
have
been
sold
at
six
francs
and
a
half
it
was
impossible
to
sell
it
at
five
francs
it
must
be
another
quality
that
she
was
referring
to
no
no
she
repeated
with
the
obstinacy
of
a
who
prided
herself
on
her
knowledge
of
such
matters
the
quality
is
the
same
the
other
may
even
be
a
little
thicker
and
the
discussion
ended
by
becoming
quite
bitter
baudu
with
his
bile
rising
to
his
face
had
to
make
an
effort
to
continue
smiling
his
rancour
against
the
ladies
paradise
was
bursting
in
his
throat
really
said
madame
bourdelais
at
last
you
must
treat
me
better
for
otherwise
i
shall
go
opposite
like
the
others
thereupon
he
lost
his
head
and
shaking
with
all
the
passion
he
had
restrained
cried
out
well
go
opposite
then
at
this
she
got
up
greatly
wounded
and
went
off
without
turning
round
but
saying
that
just
what
i
am
going
to
do
sir
a
general
stupor
ensued
the
governor
violence
had
frightened
all
of
them
he
was
himself
scared
and
trembled
at
what
he
had
just
said
the
phrase
had
escaped
him
against
his
will
in
an
explosion
of
long
rancour
and
the
baudus
now
stood
there
motionless
their
arms
hanging
by
their
sides
as
they
watched
madame
bourdelais
cross
the
street
she
seemed
to
be
carrying
off
their
fortune
when
with
a
tranquil
step
she
passed
through
the
lofty
portal
of
the
ladies
paradise
and
they
saw
her
disappear
in
the
crowd
they
felt
a
sort
of
sudden
wrench
there
another
they
taken
from
us
murmured
the
draper
and
turning
towards
denise
of
whose
he
was
aware
he
said
you
as
well
they
taken
you
back
oh
i
do
blame
you
for
it
as
they
got
the
money
they
are
naturally
the
strongest
just
then
denise
still
hoping
that
geneviève
had
not
overheard
colomban
was
saying
to
her
he
loves
you
try
and
cheer
up
but
in
a
very
low
and
voice
the
girl
replied
why
do
you
tell
me
a
falsehood
look
he
ca
help
it
he
glancing
up
there
again
i
know
very
well
that
they
stolen
him
from
me
just
as
they
robbed
us
of
everything
else
then
she
went
to
sit
down
at
the
desk
beside
her
mother
the
latter
had
doubtless
guessed
the
fresh
blow
which
her
daughter
had
received
for
her
anxious
eyes
wandered
from
her
to
colomban
and
then
to
the
paradise
it
was
true
they
had
stolen
everything
from
them
from
the
father
his
fortune
from
the
mother
her
dying
child
from
the
daughter
the
husband
for
whom
she
had
waited
ten
long
years
in
presence
of
this
condemned
family
denise
whose
heart
was
overflowing
with
pity
felt
for
an
instant
afraid
that
she
might
be
wicked
for
was
she
not
going
to
assist
that
machine
which
was
crushing
the
poor
however
she
was
carried
away
as
it
were
by
an
invisible
force
and
felt
that
she
could
be
doing
no
wrong
bah
resumed
baudu
to
give
himself
courage
we
sha
die
of
it
after
all
for
one
customer
lost
we
shall
find
two
others
you
hear
denise
i
got
over
seventy
thousand
francs
there
which
will
certainly
make
your
mouret
spend
some
sleepless
nights
come
come
you
others
do
look
so
glum
but
he
could
not
enliven
them
he
himself
relapsed
into
a
pale
consternation
and
they
all
remained
with
their
eyes
fixed
on
the
monster
attracted
possessed
glutting
themselves
with
thoughts
of
their
misfortune
the
work
was
now
nearly
finished
the
scaffoldings
had
been
removed
from
the
front
a
whole
side
of
the
colossal
edifice
appeared
with
its
white
walls
and
large
light
windows
beside
the
footway
where
traffic
had
at
last
been
resumed
stood
eight
delivery
vans
which
the
messengers
were
loading
one
after
the
other
outside
the
in
the
sunshine
a
ray
of
which
enfiladed
the
street
the
vehicles
green
panels
picked
out
with
red
and
yellow
sparkled
like
so
many
mirrors
and
cast
blinding
reflections
even
into
the
depths
of
the
old
elbeuf
the
drivers
clad
in
black
and
dignified
in
manner
held
the
horses
well
in
superb
horses
they
were
champing
silvered
bits
and
each
time
a
van
was
loaded
there
came
a
sonorous
roll
over
the
paving
stones
which
made
all
the
little
neighbouring
shops
tremble
and
then
in
presence
of
this
triumphal
procession
the
sight
of
which
they
must
needs
endure
twice
a
day
the
hearts
broke
the
father
half
fainted
away
asking
himself
where
this
continual
stream
of
goods
could
go
to
whilst
the
mother
sickening
at
thought
of
her
daughter
torture
continued
gazing
blankly
into
the
street
her
eyes
blurred
by
big
tears
chapter
ix
it
was
on
a
monday
the
of
march
that
the
ladies
paradise
inaugurated
its
new
buildings
by
a
great
exhibition
of
summer
novelties
which
was
to
last
three
days
outside
a
sharp
north
wind
was
blowing
and
the
surprised
by
this
return
of
winter
hurried
along
buttoning
up
their
overcoats
in
the
neighbouring
shops
however
all
was
fermentation
and
against
the
windows
one
could
see
the
pale
faces
of
the
petty
tradesmen
counting
the
first
carriages
which
stopped
before
the
new
grand
entrance
in
the
rue
this
doorway
lofty
and
deep
like
a
church
porch
and
surmounted
by
an
emblematical
group
of
industry
and
commerce
amidst
a
variety
of
symbols
was
sheltered
by
a
vast
glazed
the
fresh
gilding
of
which
seemed
to
light
up
the
pavement
with
a
ray
of
sunshine
to
the
right
and
left
the
shop
fronts
of
a
blinding
whiteness
stretched
along
the
rue
monsigny
and
the
rue
de
la
michodière
occupying
the
whole
block
except
on
the
rue
du
side
where
the
crédit
immobilier
intended
to
build
and
along
these
frontages
the
petty
tradesmen
whenever
they
raised
their
heads
could
see
the
piles
of
goods
through
the
large
windows
which
from
the
ground
floor
to
the
second
storey
opened
the
house
to
the
light
of
day
and
this
enormous
cube
this
colossal
bazaar
which
concealed
the
sky
from
them
seemed
in
some
degree
the
cause
of
the
cold
which
made
them
shiver
behind
their
frozen
counters
as
early
as
six
mouret
was
on
the
spot
giving
his
final
orders
in
the
centre
starting
from
the
grand
entrance
a
large
gallery
ran
from
end
to
end
flanked
right
and
left
by
two
narrower
ones
the
monsigny
gallery
and
the
michodière
gallery
glass
roofings
covered
the
turned
into
huge
halls
iron
staircases
ascended
from
the
ground
floor
on
both
upper
floors
iron
bridges
were
thrown
from
one
end
to
the
other
of
the
establishment
the
architect
who
happened
to
be
a
young
man
of
talent
with
modern
ideas
had
only
used
stone
for
the
basement
and
corner
work
employing
iron
for
all
the
rest
of
the
huge
carcass
columns
upholding
all
the
assemblage
of
beams
and
joists
the
vaulting
of
the
ceilings
like
the
partitions
was
of
brick
space
had
been
gained
everywhere
light
and
air
entered
freely
and
the
public
circulated
with
the
greatest
ease
under
the
bold
flights
of
the
girders
it
was
the
cathedral
of
modern
commerce
light
but
strong
the
very
thing
for
a
nation
of
customers
below
in
the
central
gallery
after
the
door
bargains
came
the
cravat
glove
and
silk
departments
the
monsigny
gallery
was
occupied
by
the
linen
and
rouen
goods
and
the
michodière
gallery
by
the
mercery
hosiery
drapery
and
woollens
then
on
the
first
floor
came
the
mantle
shawl
lace
and
various
new
departments
whilst
the
bedding
the
carpets
the
furnishing
materials
all
the
cumbersome
articles
difficult
to
handle
had
been
relegated
to
the
second
floor
in
all
there
were
now
departments
with
eighteen
hundred
employees
two
hundred
of
whom
were
women
quite
a
little
world
abode
there
amidst
the
sonorous
life
of
the
high
metallic
naves
mouret
unique
passion
was
to
conquer
woman
he
wished
her
to
be
queen
in
his
house
and
had
built
this
temple
that
he
might
there
hold
her
completely
at
his
mercy
his
sole
aim
was
to
intoxicate
her
with
gallant
attentions
traffic
on
her
desires
profit
by
her
fever
night
and
day
he
racked
his
brain
to
invent
fresh
attractions
he
had
already
introduced
two
lifts
in
order
to
spare
delicate
ladies
the
trouble
of
climbing
the
stairs
to
the
upper
floors
then
too
he
had
just
opened
a
bar
where
the
customers
could
find
gratuitous
light
refreshments
syrups
and
biscuits
and
a
a
monumental
gallery
decorated
with
excessive
luxury
in
which
he
had
even
ventured
on
an
exhibition
of
pictures
but
his
deepest
scheme
was
to
conquer
the
mother
through
her
child
when
unable
to
do
so
through
her
own
coquetry
and
to
attain
this
object
there
was
no
means
that
he
neglected
he
speculated
on
every
sentiment
created
special
departments
for
little
boys
and
girls
and
waylaid
the
passing
mothers
with
distributions
of
and
for
the
children
there
was
real
genius
in
his
idea
of
presenting
each
buyer
with
a
red
made
of
fine
and
bearing
in
large
letters
the
name
of
the
establishment
held
by
a
string
it
floated
in
the
air
and
sailed
along
every
street
like
a
living
advertisement
but
the
greatest
power
of
all
was
the
advertising
mouret
now
spent
three
hundred
thousand
francs
a
year
in
catalogues
advertisements
and
bills
for
his
summer
sale
he
had
launched
forth
two
hundred
thousand
catalogues
fifty
thousand
of
which
went
abroad
translated
into
every
language
he
now
had
them
illustrated
with
engravings
and
embellished
with
samples
gummed
to
the
leaves
there
was
an
overflowing
display
the
name
of
the
ladies
paradise
met
the
eye
all
over
the
world
it
invaded
the
walls
and
hoardings
the
newspapers
and
even
the
curtains
of
the
theatres
he
claimed
that
woman
was
powerless
against
advertising
that
she
was
bound
to
be
attracted
by
uproar
analyzing
her
moreover
like
a
great
moralist
he
laid
still
more
enticing
traps
for
her
thus
he
had
discovered
that
she
could
not
resist
a
bargain
that
she
bought
without
necessity
whenever
she
thought
she
saw
a
thing
cheap
and
on
this
observation
he
based
his
system
of
reductions
progressively
lowering
the
price
of
unsold
articles
and
preferring
to
sell
them
at
a
loss
rather
than
keep
them
by
him
given
his
principle
of
constantly
renewing
his
goods
and
he
had
penetrated
still
further
into
the
heart
of
woman
and
had
just
planned
the
system
of
returns
a
masterpiece
of
jesuitical
seduction
take
whatever
you
like
madame
you
can
return
it
if
you
find
you
do
like
it
and
the
woman
who
hesitated
herein
found
a
last
excuse
the
possibility
of
repairing
an
act
of
folly
were
it
deemed
too
extravagant
she
took
the
article
with
an
easy
conscience
and
now
the
returns
and
reduction
of
prices
system
formed
part
of
the
everyday
working
of
the
new
style
of
business
after
all
this
is
only
or
about
a
quarter
of
the
amount
which
a
single
english
firm
of
spends
in
advertising
every
year
but
where
mouret
revealed
himself
as
an
unrivalled
master
was
in
the
interior
arrangement
of
his
shops
he
laid
it
down
as
a
law
that
not
a
corner
of
the
ladies
paradise
ought
to
remain
deserted
he
required
a
noise
a
crowd
evidence
of
life
everywhere
for
life
said
he
attracts
life
increases
and
multiplies
it
and
this
principle
he
applied
in
a
variety
of
ways
in
the
first
place
there
ought
always
to
be
a
crush
at
the
entrance
so
that
the
people
in
the
street
should
mistake
it
for
a
riot
and
he
obtained
this
crush
by
placing
a
lot
of
bargains
at
the
doors
shelves
and
baskets
overflowing
with
articles
and
so
the
common
people
crowded
there
stopping
up
the
doorway
and
making
the
shop
look
as
if
it
were
crammed
with
customers
when
it
was
often
only
half
full
then
in
the
galleries
he
found
a
means
of
concealing
the
departments
where
business
occasionally
became
slack
for
instance
he
surrounded
the
shawl
department
in
summer
and
the
printed
calico
department
in
winter
with
other
busy
departments
steeping
them
in
continual
uproar
it
was
he
alone
who
had
thought
of
reserving
the
for
the
carpet
and
furniture
galleries
for
customers
were
less
numerous
in
such
departments
which
if
placed
on
the
ground
floor
would
have
often
presented
a
chilly
void
if
he
could
only
have
managed
it
he
would
have
let
the
street
run
through
his
shop
just
at
that
moment
mouret
was
absorbed
in
another
wonderful
inspiration
on
the
saturday
evening
whilst
giving
a
last
look
at
the
preparations
for
the
monday
great
sale
he
had
been
struck
with
the
idea
that
the
arrangement
of
the
departments
adopted
by
him
was
idiotic
and
yet
it
seemed
a
perfectly
logical
one
the
stuffs
on
one
side
the
articles
on
the
other
an
intelligent
order
of
things
which
would
enable
customers
to
find
their
way
about
by
themselves
he
had
dreamt
of
some
such
orderly
arrangement
in
the
old
days
of
madame
hédouin
narrow
shop
but
now
just
as
he
had
carried
out
his
idea
he
felt
his
faith
shaken
and
he
suddenly
cried
out
that
they
would
have
to
alter
all
that
they
had
hours
before
them
and
half
of
what
had
been
done
had
to
be
changed
the
staff
utterly
bewildered
had
been
obliged
to
work
two
nights
and
all
day
on
sunday
amidst
frightful
disorder
on
the
monday
morning
even
an
hour
before
the
opening
there
were
still
some
goods
remaining
to
be
placed
decidedly
the
governor
was
going
mad
no
one
understood
the
meaning
of
it
all
and
general
consternation
prevailed
come
look
sharp
cried
mouret
with
the
quiet
assurance
of
genius
there
are
some
more
costumes
to
be
taken
upstairs
and
the
japan
goods
are
they
placed
on
the
central
landing
a
last
effort
my
boys
you
see
the
sale
bourdoncle
had
also
been
there
since
daybreak
he
did
not
understand
the
alterations
any
more
than
the
others
did
and
followed
the
governor
movements
with
an
anxious
eye
he
hardly
dared
to
ask
him
any
questions
knowing
how
mouret
received
people
in
these
critical
moments
however
he
at
last
made
up
his
mind
and
gently
inquired
was
it
really
necessary
to
upset
everything
like
that
on
the
eve
of
our
sale
at
first
mouret
shrugged
his
shoulders
without
replying
then
as
the
other
persisted
he
burst
out
so
that
all
the
customers
should
heap
themselves
into
one
corner
eh
a
nice
idea
of
mine
i
should
never
have
got
over
it
do
you
see
that
it
would
have
localised
the
crowd
a
woman
would
have
come
in
gone
straight
to
the
department
she
wanted
passed
from
the
petticoat
to
the
dress
counter
from
the
dress
to
the
mantle
gallery
and
then
have
retired
without
even
losing
herself
for
a
moment
not
one
would
have
thoroughly
seen
the
establishment
but
now
that
you
have
disarranged
everything
and
thrown
the
goods
all
over
the
place
remarked
bourdoncle
the
employees
will
wear
out
their
legs
in
guiding
the
customers
from
department
to
department
mouret
made
a
gesture
of
superb
contempt
i
do
care
a
fig
for
that
they
young
it
make
them
grow
so
much
the
better
if
they
do
walk
about
they
appear
more
numerous
and
increase
the
crowd
the
greater
the
crush
the
better
all
will
go
well
he
laughed
and
then
deigned
to
explain
his
idea
lowering
his
voice
look
here
bourdoncle
this
is
what
the
result
will
be
first
this
continual
circulation
of
customers
will
disperse
them
all
over
the
shop
multiply
them
and
make
them
lose
their
heads
secondly
as
they
must
be
conducted
from
one
end
of
the
establishment
to
the
other
if
for
instance
they
require
a
lining
after
purchasing
a
dress
these
journeys
in
every
direction
will
triple
the
size
of
the
house
in
their
eyes
thirdly
they
will
be
forced
to
traverse
departments
where
they
would
never
have
set
foot
otherwise
temptations
will
present
themselves
on
their
passage
and
they
will
succumb
fourthly
but
bourdoncle
was
now
laughing
with
him
at
this
mouret
delighted
stopped
to
call
out
to
the
messengers
very
good
my
boys
now
for
a
sweep
and
it
be
splendid
however
on
turning
round
he
perceived
denise
he
and
bourdoncle
were
standing
opposite
the
departments
which
he
had
just
dismembered
by
sending
the
dresses
and
costumes
up
to
the
at
the
other
end
of
the
building
denise
the
first
down
was
opening
her
eyes
with
astonishment
quite
bewildered
by
the
new
arrangements
what
is
it
she
murmured
are
we
going
to
move
this
surprise
appeared
to
amuse
mouret
who
adored
these
sensational
effects
early
in
february
denise
had
returned
to
the
ladies
paradise
where
she
had
been
agreeably
surprised
to
find
the
staff
polite
almost
respectful
madame
aurélie
especially
proved
very
kind
marguerite
and
clara
seemed
resigned
whilst
old
jouve
bowed
his
head
with
an
awkward
embarrassed
air
as
if
desirous
of
effacing
all
disagreeable
memories
of
the
past
it
had
sufficed
for
mouret
to
say
a
few
words
and
everybody
was
whispering
and
following
her
with
their
eyes
and
in
this
general
amiability
the
only
things
that
hurt
her
were
singularly
melancholy
glances
and
pauline
inexplicable
smiles
however
mouret
was
still
looking
at
her
in
his
delighted
way
what
is
it
you
want
mademoiselle
he
asked
at
last
denise
had
not
noticed
him
she
blushed
slightly
since
her
return
she
had
received
various
marks
of
kindness
from
him
which
had
greatly
touched
her
on
the
other
hand
pauline
she
knew
not
why
had
given
her
a
full
account
of
the
governor
and
clara
love
affairs
and
often
returned
to
the
subject
alluding
at
the
same
time
to
that
madame
desforges
with
whom
the
whole
shop
was
well
acquainted
such
stories
stirred
denise
heart
and
now
in
mouret
presence
she
again
felt
all
her
former
fears
an
uneasiness
in
which
her
gratitude
struggled
against
her
anger
it
all
this
confusion
going
on
in
the
place
she
murmured
thereupon
mouret
approached
her
and
said
in
a
lower
voice
have
the
goodness
to
come
to
my
office
this
evening
after
business
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
greatly
agitated
she
bowed
her
head
without
replying
a
word
and
went
into
the
department
where
the
other
saleswomen
were
now
arriving
bourdoncle
however
had
overheard
mouret
and
looked
at
him
with
a
smile
he
even
ventured
to
say
when
they
were
alone
that
girl
again
be
careful
it
will
end
by
becoming
serious
but
mouret
hastily
defended
himself
concealing
his
emotion
beneath
an
air
of
superior
indifference
never
fear
it
only
a
joke
the
woman
who
catch
me
is
born
my
dear
fellow
and
then
as
the
shop
was
opening
at
last
he
rushed
off
to
give
a
final
look
at
the
various
departments
bourdoncle
shook
his
head
that
girl
denise
so
simple
and
quiet
began
to
make
him
feel
uneasy
the
first
time
he
had
conquered
by
a
brutal
dismissal
but
she
had
returned
and
he
felt
her
power
to
be
so
much
increased
that
he
now
treated
her
as
a
redoubtable
adversary
remaining
mute
before
her
and
again
patiently
waiting
developments
when
he
overtook
mouret
he
found
him
downstairs
in
the
hall
opposite
the
entrance
door
where
he
was
shouting
are
you
playing
the
fool
with
me
i
ordered
the
blue
parasols
to
be
put
as
a
border
just
pull
all
that
down
and
be
quick
about
it
he
would
listen
to
nothing
a
gang
of
messengers
had
to
come
and
the
exhibition
of
parasols
then
seeing
that
customers
were
arriving
he
even
had
the
doors
closed
for
a
moment
declaring
that
he
would
rather
keep
the
place
shut
than
have
the
blue
parasols
in
the
centre
it
ruined
his
composition
the
renowned
dressers
of
the
paradise
hutin
mignot
and
others
came
to
look
at
the
change
he
was
carrying
out
but
they
affected
not
to
understand
it
theirs
being
a
different
school
at
last
the
doors
were
again
opened
and
the
crowd
flowed
in
from
the
outset
long
before
the
shop
was
full
there
was
such
a
crush
at
the
doorway
that
they
were
obliged
to
call
the
police
to
regulate
the
traffic
on
the
foot
pavement
mouret
had
calculated
correctly
all
the
housewives
a
compact
troop
of
women
and
work
women
swarmed
around
the
bargains
and
remnants
displayed
in
the
open
street
they
felt
the
hung
goods
at
the
entrance
calico
at
seven
sous
the
mètre
wool
and
cotton
grey
stuff
at
nine
sous
and
above
all
some
orleans
at
seven
sous
and
a
half
which
was
fast
emptying
the
poorer
purses
then
there
was
feverish
jostling
and
crushing
around
the
shelves
and
baskets
where
articles
at
reduced
prices
lace
at
two
sous
ribbon
at
five
garters
at
three
the
pair
gloves
petticoats
cravats
cotton
socks
and
stockings
were
quickly
disappearing
as
if
swallowed
up
by
the
voracious
crowd
in
spite
of
the
cold
the
shopmen
who
were
selling
in
the
street
could
not
serve
fast
enough
one
woman
cried
out
with
pain
in
the
crush
and
two
little
girls
were
nearly
stifled
all
the
morning
this
crush
went
on
increasing
towards
one
there
was
a
crowd
waiting
to
enter
the
street
was
blocked
as
in
a
time
of
riot
just
at
that
moment
as
madame
de
boves
and
her
daughter
blanche
stood
hesitating
on
the
pavement
opposite
they
were
accosted
by
madame
marty
also
accompanied
by
her
daughter
valentine
what
a
crowd
eh
said
the
countess
they
killing
themselves
inside
i
ought
not
to
have
come
i
was
in
bed
but
got
up
to
take
a
little
fresh
air
it
just
like
me
said
the
other
i
promised
my
husband
to
go
and
see
his
sister
at
montmartre
then
just
as
i
was
passing
i
thought
of
a
piece
of
braid
i
wanted
i
may
as
well
buy
it
here
as
anywhere
else
may
i
oh
i
sha
spend
another
sou
in
fact
i
do
want
anything
however
seized
carried
away
as
it
were
by
the
force
of
the
crowd
they
did
not
take
their
eyes
off
the
door
no
no
i
not
going
in
i
afraid
murmured
madame
de
boves
blanche
let
go
away
we
should
be
crushed
but
her
voice
failed
her
she
was
gradually
yielding
to
a
desire
to
follow
the
others
and
her
fears
dissolved
before
the
irresistible
attractions
of
the
crush
madame
marty
likewise
was
giving
way
repeating
the
while
keep
hold
of
my
dress
valentine
ah
well
never
seen
such
a
thing
before
i
lifted
off
my
feet
what
will
it
be
inside
caught
by
the
current
the
ladies
could
not
now
go
back
just
as
rivers
attract
the
fugitive
waters
of
a
valley
so
it
seemed
as
if
the
stream
of
customers
flowing
into
the
vestibule
was
absorbing
the
drinking
in
people
from
the
four
corners
of
paris
they
advanced
but
slowly
squeezed
almost
to
death
and
maintained
upright
by
the
shoulders
around
them
and
their
desires
already
derived
enjoyment
from
this
painful
entrance
which
heightened
their
curiosity
it
was
a
medley
of
ladies
arrayed
in
silk
of
poorly
dressed
women
and
of
girls
all
excited
and
carried
away
by
the
same
passion
a
few
men
buried
beneath
the
overflowing
bosoms
were
casting
anxious
glances
around
them
a
nurse
in
the
thickest
of
the
crowd
held
her
baby
above
her
head
the
youngster
crowing
with
delight
the
only
one
to
get
angry
was
a
skinny
woman
who
broke
out
into
bad
words
accusing
her
neighbour
of
digging
right
into
her
i
really
think
i
shall
lose
my
skirts
in
this
crowd
remarked
madame
de
boves
mute
her
face
still
cool
from
the
open
air
madame
marty
was
standing
on
in
her
endeavour
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
depths
of
the
shop
before
the
others
the
pupils
of
her
grey
eyes
were
as
contracted
as
those
of
a
cat
coming
out
of
the
broad
daylight
and
she
had
the
restful
feeling
and
clear
expression
of
a
person
just
waking
up
ah
at
last
said
she
heaving
a
sigh
the
ladies
had
just
extricated
themselves
they
were
in
the
hall
which
they
were
greatly
surprised
to
find
almost
empty
but
a
feeling
of
comfort
penetrated
them
they
seemed
to
be
entering
into
spring
after
emerging
from
the
winter
of
the
street
whilst
the
piercing
wind
laden
with
rain
and
hail
was
still
blowing
out
of
doors
the
fine
season
was
already
budding
forth
in
the
paradise
galleries
with
the
light
stuffs
soft
flowery
shades
and
rural
gaiety
of
summer
dresses
and
parasols
do
look
there
exclaimed
madame
de
boves
standing
motionless
her
eyes
in
the
air
it
was
the
exhibition
of
parasols
and
rounded
like
shields
they
covered
the
whole
hall
from
the
glazed
roofing
to
the
varnished
oak
mouldings
below
they
described
festoons
round
the
arches
of
the
upper
storeys
they
descended
in
garlands
down
the
slender
columns
they
ran
in
close
lines
along
the
balustrades
of
the
galleries
and
the
staircases
and
everywhere
ranged
symmetrically
speckling
the
walls
with
red
green
and
yellow
they
looked
like
huge
venetian
lanterns
lighted
up
for
some
colossal
entertainment
in
the
corners
were
more
complicated
designs
stars
composed
of
parasols
at
sous
whose
light
shades
pale
blue
and
blush
rose
had
the
subdued
glow
of
whilst
up
above
immense
japanese
parasols
on
which
cranes
soared
in
purple
skies
blazed
forth
with
fiery
reflections
madame
marty
endeavouring
to
find
a
phrase
to
express
her
rapture
exclaimed
it
like
fairyland
and
then
trying
to
find
out
where
she
was
she
continued
let
see
the
braid
is
in
the
mercery
department
i
shall
buy
my
braid
and
be
off
i
will
go
with
you
said
madame
de
boves
eh
blanche
we
just
go
through
the
shop
nothing
more
but
they
had
hardly
left
the
door
before
they
lost
themselves
they
turned
to
the
left
and
as
the
mercery
department
had
been
moved
they
dropped
into
the
one
devoted
to
collarettes
cuffs
trimmings
etc
a
heat
moist
and
close
laden
with
the
insipid
odour
of
the
materials
and
muffling
the
tramping
of
the
crowd
prevailed
in
the
galleries
then
they
returned
to
the
door
where
an
outward
current
was
already
established
an
interminable
of
women
and
children
above
whom
hovered
a
multitude
of
red
forty
thousand
of
these
were
ready
there
were
men
specially
placed
for
their
distribution
and
to
see
the
customers
on
their
way
out
one
might
have
imagined
that
a
flight
of
enormous
reflecting
the
fiery
glare
of
the
parasols
was
hovering
in
the
air
the
whole
place
was
illuminated
by
them
there
quite
a
world
here
declared
madame
de
boves
you
hardly
know
where
you
are
however
the
ladies
could
not
remain
in
the
eddy
of
the
door
right
in
the
crush
of
the
entrance
and
exit
fortunately
inspector
jouve
came
to
their
assistance
he
stood
in
the
vestibule
grave
and
attentive
eyeing
each
woman
as
she
passed
specially
charged
with
the
indoor
police
service
he
was
on
the
for
thieves
and
lifters
the
mercery
department
ladies
said
he
obligingly
turn
to
the
left
you
see
just
there
behind
the
hosiery
department
madame
de
boves
thanked
him
but
madame
marty
on
turning
round
no
longer
saw
her
daughter
valentine
beside
her
she
was
beginning
to
feel
frightened
when
she
caught
sight
of
her
already
a
long
way
off
at
the
end
of
the
hall
deeply
absorbed
before
a
table
covered
with
a
heap
of
women
cravats
at
nineteen
sous
mouret
practised
the
system
of
offering
articles
to
the
customers
hooking
and
plundering
them
as
they
passed
for
he
made
use
of
every
sort
of
advertisement
laughing
at
the
discretion
of
certain
who
thought
their
goods
should
be
left
to
speak
for
themselves
special
salesmen
idle
and
parisians
in
this
way
got
rid
of
considerable
quantities
of
small
trashy
things
oh
mamma
murmured
valentine
just
look
at
these
cravats
they
have
a
bird
embroidered
at
one
corner
the
shopman
cracked
up
the
article
swore
that
it
was
all
silk
that
the
manufacturer
had
become
bankrupt
and
that
they
would
never
have
such
a
bargain
again
nineteen
sous
is
it
possible
said
madame
marty
tempted
like
her
daughter
well
i
can
take
a
couple
that
wo
ruin
us
madame
de
boves
however
disdained
this
style
of
thing
she
detested
to
have
things
offered
to
her
a
shopman
calling
her
made
her
run
away
madame
marty
surprised
could
not
understand
such
nervous
horror
of
commercial
quackery
for
she
was
of
another
nature
she
was
one
of
those
women
who
delight
in
being
thus
caressed
by
a
public
offer
in
plunging
their
hands
into
everything
and
wasting
their
time
in
useless
talk
now
said
she
i
going
for
my
braid
i
do
wish
to
see
anything
else
however
as
she
crossed
the
scarf
and
glove
departments
her
heart
once
more
failed
her
here
in
the
diffuse
light
was
a
display
made
up
of
bright
gay
colours
of
ravishing
effect
the
counters
symmetrically
arranged
seemed
like
so
many
changing
the
hall
into
a
french
garden
where
smiled
a
soft
scale
of
blossoms
lying
now
on
the
bare
wood
now
in
open
boxes
and
now
protruding
from
overflowing
drawers
was
a
quantity
of
silk
handkerchiefs
of
every
hue
you
found
the
bright
scarlet
of
the
geranium
the
creamy
white
of
the
petunia
the
golden
yellow
of
the
chrysanthemum
the
celestial
azure
of
the
verbena
and
higher
up
on
brass
rods
another
florescence
was
entwined
a
florescence
of
carelessly
hung
and
unrolled
ribbons
quite
a
brilliant
which
extended
on
and
on
climbing
the
columns
and
constantly
multiplying
in
the
mirrors
but
what
most
attracted
the
throng
was
a
swiss
chalet
in
the
glove
department
a
chalet
made
entirely
of
gloves
mignot
which
it
had
taken
him
two
days
to
arrange
in
the
first
place
the
was
composed
of
black
gloves
and
then
in
turn
came
mignonette
and
gloves
distributed
over
the
decoration
bordering
the
windows
outlining
the
balconies
and
taking
the
place
of
the
tiles
what
do
you
desire
madame
asked
mignot
on
seeing
madame
marty
planted
before
the
cottage
here
are
some
suède
gloves
at
one
franc
centimes
the
pair
first
quality
he
offered
his
wares
with
furious
energy
calling
the
passing
customers
to
his
counter
and
dunning
them
with
his
politeness
and
as
she
shook
her
head
in
token
of
refusal
he
continued
tyrolian
gloves
one
franc
turin
gloves
for
children
embroidered
gloves
in
all
colours
no
thanks
i
do
want
anything
declared
madame
marty
but
realising
that
her
voice
was
softening
he
attacked
her
with
greater
energy
than
ever
holding
the
embroidered
gloves
before
her
eyes
and
she
could
not
resist
she
bought
a
pair
then
as
madame
de
boves
looked
at
her
with
a
smile
she
blushed
do
you
think
me
childish
eh
if
i
do
make
haste
and
get
my
braid
and
be
off
i
shall
be
done
for
unfortunately
there
was
such
a
crush
in
the
mercery
department
that
she
could
not
get
served
they
had
both
been
waiting
for
over
ten
minutes
and
were
getting
annoyed
when
a
sudden
meeting
with
madame
bourdelais
and
her
three
children
diverted
their
attention
madame
bourdelais
explained
with
her
quiet
practical
air
that
she
had
brought
the
little
ones
to
see
the
show
madeleine
was
ten
edmond
eight
and
lucien
four
years
old
and
they
were
laughing
with
joy
it
was
a
cheap
treat
which
they
had
long
looked
forward
to
those
red
parasols
are
really
too
comical
i
must
buy
one
said
madame
marty
all
at
once
stamping
with
impatience
at
doing
nothing
she
choose
one
at
fourteen
francs
and
a
half
whereupon
madame
bourdelais
after
watching
the
purchase
with
a
look
of
censure
said
to
her
amicably
you
are
wrong
to
be
in
such
a
hurry
in
a
month
time
you
could
have
had
it
for
ten
francs
they
wo
catch
me
like
that
and
thereupon
she
developed
quite
a
theory
of
careful
housekeeping
since
the
shops
lowered
their
prices
it
was
simply
a
question
of
waiting
she
did
not
wish
to
be
taken
in
by
them
she
preferred
to
profit
by
their
real
bargains
she
even
showed
some
malice
in
the
struggle
boasting
that
she
had
never
left
them
a
sou
of
profit
come
said
she
at
last
i
promised
my
little
ones
to
show
them
the
pictures
upstairs
in
the
come
up
with
us
you
have
plenty
of
time
and
thereupon
the
braid
was
forgotten
madame
marty
yielded
at
once
whilst
madame
de
boves
declined
preferring
to
take
a
turn
on
the
first
of
all
besides
they
were
sure
to
meet
again
upstairs
madame
bourdelais
was
looking
for
a
staircase
when
she
perceived
one
of
the
lifts
and
thereupon
she
pushed
her
children
into
it
in
order
to
cap
their
pleasure
madame
marty
and
valentine
also
entered
the
narrow
cage
where
they
were
very
closely
packed
however
the
mirrors
the
velvet
seats
and
the
polished
brasswork
took
up
so
much
of
their
attention
that
they
reached
the
first
floor
without
having
felt
the
gentle
ascent
of
the
machine
another
pleasure
was
in
store
for
them
in
the
first
gallery
as
they
passed
before
the
refreshment
bar
madame
bourdelais
did
not
fail
to
gorge
her
little
family
with
syrup
it
was
a
square
room
with
a
large
marble
counter
at
either
end
there
were
silvered
filters
from
which
trickled
small
streams
of
water
whilst
rows
of
bottles
stood
on
small
shelves
behind
three
waiters
were
continually
engaged
in
wiping
and
filling
the
glasses
to
restrain
the
thirsty
crowd
they
had
been
obliged
to
imitate
the
practice
followed
at
theatres
and
by
erecting
a
barrier
draped
with
velvet
the
crush
was
terrific
some
people
whom
these
gratuitous
treats
rendered
altogether
unscrupulous
really
made
themselves
well
where
are
they
exclaimed
madame
bourdelais
when
she
extricated
herself
from
the
crowd
after
wiping
the
children
faces
with
her
handkerchief
but
she
caught
sight
of
madame
marty
and
valentine
at
the
further
end
of
another
gallery
a
long
way
off
buried
beneath
a
heap
of
petticoats
they
were
still
buying
there
was
no
more
restraint
mother
and
daughter
vanished
in
the
fever
of
expenditure
which
was
carrying
them
away
when
madame
bourdelais
at
last
reached
the
she
installed
madeleine
edmond
and
lucien
before
the
large
table
and
taking
some
photographic
albums
from
one
of
the
she
brought
them
to
them
the
ceiling
of
the
long
apartment
was
covered
with
gilding
at
either
end
was
a
monumental
some
pictures
of
no
great
merit
but
very
richly
framed
covered
the
walls
and
between
the
columns
before
each
of
the
arched
bays
opening
into
the
shop
were
tall
green
plants
in
majolica
vases
a
silent
throng
surrounded
the
table
which
was
littered
with
reviews
and
newspapers
with
here
and
there
some
boxes
of
stationery
and
ladies
took
off
their
gloves
and
wrote
letters
on
the
paper
stamped
with
the
name
of
the
establishment
through
which
they
ran
their
pens
a
few
gentlemen
lolling
back
in
armchairs
were
reading
the
newspapers
but
a
great
many
people
sat
there
doing
nothing
these
were
husbands
waiting
for
their
wives
who
were
roaming
through
the
various
departments
young
women
on
the
watch
for
their
lovers
and
old
relations
left
there
as
in
a
to
be
taken
away
when
it
was
time
to
leave
and
all
these
people
lounged
and
rested
whilst
glancing
through
the
open
bays
into
the
depths
of
the
galleries
and
the
halls
whence
a
distant
murmur
ascended
amidst
the
scratching
of
pens
and
the
rustling
of
newspapers
what
you
here
said
madame
bourdelais
all
at
once
i
recognise
you
near
the
children
sat
a
lady
her
face
hidden
by
the
open
pages
of
a
review
it
was
madame
guibal
she
seemed
annoyed
at
the
meeting
but
quickly
recovering
herself
related
that
she
had
come
to
sit
down
for
a
moment
in
order
to
escape
the
crush
and
as
madame
bourdelais
asked
her
if
she
was
going
to
make
any
purchases
she
replied
with
her
languorous
air
veiling
the
egoistical
greediness
of
her
glance
with
her
eyelids
oh
no
on
the
contrary
i
have
come
to
return
some
goods
yes
some
which
i
do
like
but
there
is
such
a
crowd
that
i
am
waiting
to
get
near
the
department
then
she
went
on
talking
saying
how
convenient
this
system
of
returns
was
formerly
she
had
never
bought
anything
but
now
she
sometimes
allowed
herself
to
be
tempted
in
fact
she
returned
four
articles
out
of
every
five
and
was
getting
known
at
all
the
counters
for
the
strange
trafficking
she
carried
on
a
trafficking
easily
divined
by
the
perpetual
discontent
which
made
her
bring
back
her
purchases
one
by
one
after
she
had
kept
them
several
days
however
whilst
speaking
she
did
not
take
her
eyes
off
the
doors
of
the
and
she
appeared
greatly
relieved
when
madame
bourdelais
rejoined
her
children
to
explain
the
photographs
to
them
almost
at
the
same
moment
monsieur
de
boves
and
paul
de
vallagnosc
came
in
the
count
who
affected
to
be
showing
the
young
man
through
the
new
buildings
exchanged
a
quick
glance
with
madame
guibal
and
she
then
plunged
into
her
review
again
as
if
she
had
not
seen
him
hallo
paul
suddenly
exclaimed
a
voice
behind
the
two
gentlemen
it
was
mouret
taking
a
glance
round
the
various
departments
they
shook
hands
and
he
at
once
inquired
has
madame
de
boves
done
us
the
honour
of
coming
well
no
replied
the
husband
and
she
very
much
regrets
it
not
very
well
oh
nothing
dangerous
however
but
he
suddenly
pretended
to
catch
sight
of
madame
guibal
and
hastened
off
approaching
her
bareheaded
whilst
the
others
merely
bowed
to
her
from
a
distance
she
also
pretended
to
be
surprised
paul
smiled
he
now
understood
the
affair
and
he
related
to
mouret
in
a
low
voice
how
boves
whom
he
had
met
in
the
rue
de
richelieu
had
tried
to
get
away
from
him
and
had
finished
by
dragging
him
into
the
ladies
paradise
under
the
pretext
that
he
must
show
him
the
new
buildings
for
the
last
year
the
lady
had
drawn
all
the
money
she
could
from
boves
making
constant
appointments
with
him
in
public
places
churches
museums
and
shops
just
look
at
him
added
the
young
man
is
he
splendid
standing
there
before
her
with
his
dignified
air
it
the
old
french
gallantry
my
dear
fellow
the
old
french
gallantry
and
your
marriage
asked
mouret
paul
without
taking
his
eyes
off
the
count
replied
that
they
were
still
waiting
for
the
death
of
the
aunt
then
with
a
triumphant
air
he
added
there
did
you
see
him
he
stooped
down
and
slipped
an
address
into
her
hand
she
now
accepting
the
rendezvous
with
the
most
virtuous
air
she
a
terrible
woman
is
that
delicate
creature
with
her
careless
ways
well
some
fine
things
go
on
in
your
place
oh
replied
mouret
smiling
these
ladies
are
not
in
my
house
they
are
at
home
here
then
still
continuing
his
gossip
he
carried
his
old
comrade
along
to
the
threshold
of
the
opposite
the
grand
central
gallery
whose
successive
halls
spread
out
below
them
in
the
rear
the
still
retained
its
quietude
only
disturbed
by
the
scratching
of
pens
and
the
rustling
of
newspapers
one
old
gentleman
had
gone
to
sleep
over
the
monsieur
de
boves
was
looking
at
the
pictures
with
the
evident
intention
of
losing
his
future
in
the
crowd
as
soon
as
possible
and
alone
amid
this
calmness
madame
bourdelais
was
amusing
her
children
talking
very
loudly
as
in
a
conquered
place
you
see
they
are
quite
at
home
said
mouret
who
pointed
with
a
broad
gesture
to
the
multitude
of
women
with
which
the
departments
were
overflowing
just
then
madame
desforges
after
nearly
having
her
mantle
carried
away
in
the
crowd
at
last
effected
an
entrance
and
crossed
the
first
hall
then
on
reaching
the
principal
gallery
she
raised
her
eyes
it
was
like
a
railway
span
surrounded
by
the
balustrades
of
the
two
storeys
intersected
by
hanging
stairways
and
crossed
by
flying
bridges
the
iron
staircases
developed
bold
curves
which
multiplied
the
landings
the
bridges
suspended
in
space
ran
straight
along
at
a
great
height
and
in
the
white
light
from
the
windows
all
this
iron
work
formed
an
excessively
delicate
architecture
an
intricate
through
which
the
daylight
penetrated
the
modern
realization
of
a
dreamland
palace
of
a
babel
with
storeys
piled
one
above
the
other
and
spacious
halls
affording
glimpses
of
other
floors
and
other
halls
in
fact
iron
reigned
everywhere
the
young
architect
had
been
honest
and
courageous
enough
not
to
disguise
it
under
a
coating
of
paint
imitating
stone
or
wood
down
below
in
order
not
to
outshine
the
goods
the
decoration
was
sober
with
large
regular
spaces
in
neutral
tints
then
as
the
metallic
work
ascended
the
capitals
of
the
columns
became
richer
the
rivets
formed
ornaments
the
and
corbels
were
covered
with
sculptured
work
and
at
last
up
above
glistened
painting
green
and
red
amidst
a
prodigality
of
gold
floods
of
gold
heaps
of
gold
even
to
the
whose
panes
were
enamelled
and
inlaid
with
gold
in
the
galleries
the
bare
of
the
arches
was
also
decorated
in
bright
colours
mosaics
and
faience
likewise
formed
part
of
the
decoration
enlivening
the
friezes
and
lighting
up
the
severe
with
their
fresh
tints
whilst
the
stairs
with
covered
were
edged
with
bands
of
polished
iron
which
shone
like
the
steel
of
armour
although
madame
desforges
was
already
acquainted
with
the
new
establishment
she
stopped
short
struck
by
the
ardent
life
which
that
day
animated
the
immense
nave
below
and
around
her
continued
the
eddying
of
the
crowd
the
double
current
of
those
entering
and
those
leaving
making
itself
felt
as
far
as
the
silk
department
it
was
still
a
crowd
of
very
mixed
elements
though
the
afternoon
was
bringing
a
greater
number
of
ladies
amongst
the
shopkeepers
and
there
were
many
women
in
mourning
with
flowing
veils
and
there
were
always
some
wet
nurses
straying
about
and
protecting
their
infantile
charges
with
their
outstretched
arms
and
this
sea
of
faces
of
hats
and
bare
heads
both
dark
and
fair
rolled
from
one
to
the
other
end
of
the
galleries
vague
and
discoloured
amidst
the
glare
of
the
stuffs
on
all
sides
madame
desforges
saw
large
bearing
enormous
figures
and
showing
prominently
against
the
bright
printed
cottons
the
shining
silks
and
the
sombre
woollens
piles
of
ribbons
half
hid
the
heads
of
the
customers
a
wall
of
flannel
threw
out
a
promontory
on
all
sides
mirrors
multiplied
the
departments
reflecting
the
displays
and
the
groups
of
people
now
showing
faces
reversed
and
now
halves
of
shoulders
and
arms
whilst
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
the
lateral
galleries
opened
up
other
vistas
the
snowy
depths
of
the
linen
department
and
the
speckled
depths
of
the
hosiery
counters
distant
views
which
were
illumined
by
rays
of
light
from
some
glazed
bay
and
in
which
the
crowd
seemed
but
so
much
human
dust
then
when
madame
desforges
raised
her
eyes
she
beheld
on
the
staircases
and
the
flying
bridges
and
behind
the
balustrades
of
each
successive
storey
a
continual
buzzing
ascent
an
entire
population
in
the
air
passing
along
behind
the
open
work
of
this
huge
carcass
of
metal
and
showing
blackly
against
the
diffuse
light
from
the
enamelled
glass
large
gilded
lustres
were
suspended
from
the
ceiling
decorations
of
rugs
embroidered
silks
and
stuffs
worked
with
gold
hung
down
draping
the
balustrades
as
with
gorgeous
banners
and
from
one
to
the
other
end
were
clouds
of
lace
palpitations
of
muslin
trophies
of
silks
groups
of
dummies
and
right
at
the
top
above
all
the
confusion
the
bedding
department
hanging
as
it
were
in
the
air
displayed
its
little
iron
bedsteads
provided
with
mattresses
and
hung
with
curtains
the
whole
forming
a
sort
of
school
dormitory
asleep
amidst
the
tramping
of
the
customers
who
became
fewer
and
fewer
as
the
departments
ascended
does
madame
require
a
cheap
pair
of
garters
asked
a
salesman
of
madame
desforges
on
seeing
her
standing
still
all
silk
at
sous
she
did
not
condescend
to
answer
things
were
being
offered
around
her
more
feverishly
than
ever
she
wanted
however
to
find
out
where
she
was
albert
lhomme
was
on
her
left
he
knew
her
by
sight
and
ventured
to
give
her
an
amiable
smile
not
showing
the
least
hurry
amidst
the
heaps
of
bills
by
which
he
was
besieged
though
behind
him
joseph
struggling
with
the
could
not
pack
up
the
articles
fast
enough
she
then
saw
where
she
was
the
silk
department
must
be
in
front
of
her
but
it
took
her
ten
minutes
to
reach
it
so
dense
was
the
crowd
becoming
up
in
the
air
at
the
end
of
their
invisible
strings
the
red
had
become
more
numerous
than
ever
they
now
formed
clouds
of
purple
gently
blowing
towards
the
doors
whence
they
continued
scattering
over
paris
and
she
had
to
bow
her
head
beneath
their
flight
whenever
very
young
children
held
them
with
the
string
rolled
round
their
little
fingers
what
you
have
ventured
here
madame
exclaimed
bouthemont
gaily
as
soon
as
he
caught
sight
of
madame
desforges
the
manager
of
the
silk
department
introduced
to
her
by
mouret
himself
now
occasionally
called
on
her
at
her
five
tea
she
thought
him
common
but
very
amiable
of
a
fine
sanguine
temper
which
surprised
and
amused
her
moreover
some
two
days
previously
he
had
boldly
told
her
of
the
intrigue
between
mouret
and
clara
he
had
not
done
this
with
any
calculating
motive
but
out
of
sheer
stupidity
like
a
fellow
who
loves
a
joke
she
however
stung
with
jealousy
concealing
her
wounded
feelings
beneath
an
appearance
of
disdain
had
that
afternoon
come
to
try
and
discover
her
rival
a
young
lady
in
the
mantle
department
so
bouthemont
had
told
her
though
declining
to
give
the
name
do
you
require
anything
he
inquired
of
course
or
i
should
not
have
come
have
you
any
for
morning
gowns
she
hoped
to
obtain
the
name
of
the
young
lady
from
him
for
she
was
full
of
a
desire
to
see
her
he
immediately
called
favier
and
then
went
on
chatting
whilst
waiting
for
the
salesman
who
was
just
serving
another
customer
this
happened
to
be
the
pretty
lady
that
beautiful
blonde
of
whom
the
whole
department
occasionally
spoke
without
knowing
anything
of
her
life
or
even
her
name
this
time
the
pretty
lady
was
in
deep
mourning
whom
could
she
have
lost
her
husband
or
her
father
not
her
father
for
she
would
have
appeared
more
melancholy
what
had
they
all
been
saying
then
she
could
not
be
a
questionable
character
she
must
have
had
a
real
husband
that
is
unless
she
were
in
mourning
for
her
mother
for
a
few
minutes
despite
the
press
of
business
the
department
exchanged
these
various
speculations
make
haste
it
intolerable
cried
hutin
to
favier
when
he
returned
from
showing
his
customer
to
the
whenever
that
lady
is
here
you
never
seem
to
finish
she
does
care
a
fig
for
you
she
cares
a
deuced
sight
more
for
me
than
i
do
for
her
replied
the
vexed
salesman
but
hutin
threatened
to
report
him
to
the
directors
if
he
did
not
show
more
respect
for
the
customers
the
was
becoming
terrible
of
a
morose
severity
ever
since
the
department
had
conspired
to
get
him
robineau
place
he
even
showed
himself
so
intolerable
after
all
the
promises
of
with
which
he
had
formerly
warmed
his
colleagues
zeal
that
the
latter
were
now
secretly
supporting
favier
against
him
now
then
no
back
answers
replied
hutin
sharply
monsieur
bouthemont
wishes
you
to
show
some
of
the
lightest
patterns
in
the
middle
of
the
department
an
exhibition
of
summer
silks
illumined
the
hall
with
an
brilliancy
like
the
rising
of
a
planet
amidst
the
most
delicate
tints
pale
rose
soft
yellow
limpid
blue
indeed
the
whole
scarf
of
iris
there
were
of
a
cloudy
fineness
surahs
lighter
than
the
down
falling
from
trees
satined
pekins
as
soft
and
supple
as
a
chinese
beauty
skin
then
came
japanese
pongees
indian
tussores
and
corahs
without
counting
the
light
french
silks
the
narrow
stripes
the
small
checks
and
the
flowered
patterns
all
the
most
fanciful
designs
which
made
one
think
of
ladies
in
furbelows
strolling
in
the
sweet
may
mornings
under
the
spreading
trees
of
some
park
i
take
this
the
louis
xiv
with
figured
roses
said
madame
desforges
at
last
and
whilst
favier
was
measuring
it
she
made
a
last
attempt
with
bouthemont
who
had
remained
near
her
i
going
up
to
the
department
to
see
if
they
have
any
travelling
cloaks
is
she
fair
the
young
lady
you
were
talking
about
the
manager
who
felt
rather
anxious
on
finding
her
so
persistent
merely
smiled
but
just
at
that
moment
denise
passed
by
she
had
just
come
from
the
merinoes
which
were
in
the
charge
of
liénard
to
whom
she
had
escorted
madame
boutarel
that
provincial
lady
who
came
to
paris
twice
a
year
to
scatter
the
money
she
saved
out
of
her
housekeeping
all
over
the
ladies
paradise
and
thereupon
just
as
favier
was
about
to
take
up
madame
desforges
silk
hutin
thinking
to
annoy
him
interfered
it
quite
unnecessary
mademoiselle
will
have
the
kindness
to
conduct
this
lady
denise
quite
confused
at
once
took
charge
of
the
parcel
and
the
she
could
never
meet
this
young
man
face
to
face
without
experiencing
a
feeling
of
shame
as
if
he
reminded
her
of
some
former
fault
and
yet
she
had
only
sinned
in
her
dreams
but
just
tell
me
said
madame
desforges
in
a
low
tone
to
bouthemont
is
it
this
awkward
girl
he
has
taken
her
back
i
see
it
must
be
she
who
is
the
heroine
of
the
adventure
perhaps
replied
the
silk
manager
still
smiling
but
fully
decided
not
to
tell
the
truth
madame
desforges
then
slowly
ascended
the
staircase
preceded
by
denise
but
after
every
two
or
three
steps
she
had
to
pause
in
order
to
avoid
being
carried
away
by
the
descending
crowd
in
the
living
vibration
of
the
whole
building
the
iron
supports
seemed
to
sway
under
your
feet
as
if
quivering
beneath
the
breath
of
the
multitude
on
each
stair
was
a
strongly
fixed
dummy
displaying
some
garment
or
other
a
costume
cloak
or
and
the
whole
was
like
a
double
row
of
soldiers
at
attention
whilst
some
triumphal
procession
went
past
madame
desforges
was
at
last
reaching
the
first
storey
when
a
still
greater
surging
of
the
crowd
forced
her
to
stop
once
more
beneath
her
she
now
had
the
departments
on
the
with
the
press
of
customers
through
which
she
had
just
passed
this
was
a
new
spectacle
a
sea
of
heads
swarming
with
agitation
like
an
the
white
now
seemed
but
so
many
narrow
lines
the
piles
of
ribbon
became
quite
squat
the
promontory
of
flannel
was
but
a
thin
partition
barring
the
gallery
whilst
the
carpets
and
the
embroidered
silks
which
decked
the
balustrades
hung
down
like
processional
banners
suspended
from
the
gallery
of
a
church
in
the
distance
madame
desforges
could
perceive
some
corners
of
the
lateral
galleries
just
as
from
the
top
of
a
steeple
one
perceives
the
corners
of
neighbouring
streets
with
black
specks
of
moving
about
but
what
surprised
her
above
all
in
the
weariness
of
her
eyes
blinded
by
the
brilliant
medley
of
colours
was
on
lowering
their
lids
to
realize
the
presence
of
the
crowd
more
keenly
than
ever
by
its
dull
roar
like
that
of
the
rising
tide
and
the
human
warmth
that
it
exhaled
a
fine
dust
rose
from
the
floor
laden
with
di
a
penetrating
perfume
which
seemed
like
the
incense
of
this
temple
raised
for
the
worship
of
woman
meanwhile
mouret
still
standing
before
the
with
vallagnosc
was
inhaling
this
odour
intoxicating
himself
with
it
and
repeating
they
are
quite
at
home
i
know
some
who
spend
the
whole
day
here
eating
cakes
and
writing
letters
there
only
one
thing
left
me
to
do
and
that
is
to
find
them
beds
this
joke
made
paul
smile
he
who
in
his
pessimistic
boredom
considered
the
turbulence
of
this
multitude
running
after
a
lot
of
to
be
idiotic
whenever
he
came
to
give
his
old
comrade
a
he
went
away
almost
vexed
to
find
him
so
full
of
life
amidst
his
people
of
coquettes
would
not
one
of
them
with
shallow
brain
and
empty
heart
some
day
make
him
realize
the
stupidity
and
uselessness
of
life
that
very
day
octave
seemed
to
have
lost
some
of
his
equilibrium
he
who
generally
inspired
his
customers
with
a
fever
with
the
tranquil
grace
of
an
operator
was
as
though
caught
by
the
passion
which
was
gradually
consuming
the
whole
establishment
since
he
had
caught
sight
of
denise
and
madame
desforges
coming
up
the
grand
staircase
he
had
been
talking
louder
gesticulating
against
his
will
and
though
he
affected
not
to
turn
his
face
towards
them
he
grew
more
and
more
animated
as
he
felt
them
drawing
nearer
his
face
became
flushed
and
in
his
eyes
was
a
little
of
that
bewildered
rapture
with
which
the
eyes
of
his
customers
at
last
quivered
you
must
be
fearfully
robbed
murmured
vallagnosc
who
thought
that
the
crowd
looked
very
criminal
mouret
threw
his
arms
out
my
dear
fellow
it
beyond
all
imagination
said
he
and
nervously
delighted
at
having
something
to
talk
about
he
gave
a
number
of
details
related
cases
and
classified
the
delinquents
in
the
first
place
there
were
the
professional
thieves
these
women
did
the
least
harm
of
all
for
the
police
knew
every
one
of
them
then
came
the
kleptomaniacs
who
stole
from
a
perverse
desire
a
new
form
of
nervous
affection
which
a
doctor
had
classed
showing
it
to
be
the
result
of
the
temptations
of
the
big
shops
and
finally
came
the
women
who
were
and
whose
thefts
were
invariably
thefts
of
some
especially
coveted
article
for
instance
at
the
house
of
one
of
them
the
district
commissary
of
police
had
found
two
hundred
and
pairs
of
pink
gloves
stolen
from
well
nigh
every
shop
in
paris
that
what
gives
the
women
such
funny
eyes
here
then
murmured
vallagnosc
i
been
watching
them
with
their
greedy
shameful
looks
like
mad
creatures
a
fine
school
for
honesty
hang
it
replied
mouret
though
we
make
them
quite
at
home
we
ca
let
them
take
the
goods
away
under
their
mantles
and
sometimes
they
are
very
respectable
people
last
week
we
caught
the
sister
of
a
chemist
and
the
wife
of
a
judge
yes
the
wife
of
a
judge
however
we
always
try
to
settle
these
matters
he
paused
to
point
out
jouve
who
was
just
then
looking
sharply
after
a
woman
at
the
ribbon
counter
below
this
woman
who
appeared
to
be
suffering
a
great
deal
from
the
jostling
of
the
crowd
was
accompanied
by
a
friend
whose
mission
seemed
to
be
to
protect
her
against
all
hurt
and
each
time
she
stopped
in
a
department
jouve
kept
his
eyes
on
her
whilst
her
friend
near
by
ransacked
the
boxes
at
her
ease
oh
he
catch
her
resumed
mouret
he
knows
all
their
tricks
but
his
voice
trembled
and
he
laughed
in
an
awkward
manner
denise
and
henriette
whom
he
had
ceased
to
watch
were
at
last
passing
behind
him
after
having
had
a
great
deal
of
trouble
to
get
out
of
the
crush
he
turned
round
suddenly
and
bowed
to
his
customer
with
the
discreet
air
of
a
friend
who
does
not
desire
to
compromise
a
woman
by
stopping
her
in
a
crowd
of
people
but
henriette
on
the
alert
had
at
once
perceived
the
look
with
which
he
had
first
enveloped
denise
it
must
be
this
girl
thought
she
yes
this
was
the
rival
she
had
been
curious
to
come
and
see
in
the
mantle
department
the
young
ladies
were
fast
losing
their
heads
two
of
them
had
fallen
ill
and
madame
frédéric
the
had
quietly
given
notice
the
previous
day
and
repaired
to
the
cashier
office
to
take
her
money
leaving
the
ladies
paradise
at
a
minute
notice
just
as
the
ladies
paradise
itself
discharged
its
employees
ever
since
the
morning
in
spite
of
the
feverish
rush
of
business
every
one
had
been
talking
of
this
affair
clara
still
kept
in
the
department
by
mouret
caprice
thought
it
grand
marguerite
related
how
exasperated
bourdoncle
was
whilst
madame
aurélie
greatly
vexed
declared
that
madame
frédéric
ought
at
least
to
have
informed
her
for
such
hypocrisy
had
never
before
been
heard
of
although
madame
frédéric
had
never
confided
in
any
one
she
was
suspected
of
having
relinquished
her
position
to
marry
the
proprietor
of
some
baths
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
halles
it
a
travelling
cloak
that
madame
desires
i
believe
inquired
denise
of
madame
desforges
after
offering
her
a
chair
yes
curtly
replied
the
latter
who
had
made
up
her
mind
to
be
impolite
the
new
decorations
of
the
department
were
of
a
rich
severity
on
all
sides
were
high
carved
oak
cupboards
with
mirrors
filling
the
whole
space
of
their
panels
while
a
red
carpet
muffled
the
continued
tramping
of
the
customers
whilst
denise
went
off
to
fetch
the
cloaks
madame
desforges
who
was
looking
round
perceived
her
face
in
a
glass
and
she
continued
contemplating
herself
was
she
getting
old
then
that
she
should
be
cast
aside
for
the
the
glass
reflected
the
entire
department
with
all
its
commotion
but
she
only
beheld
her
own
pale
face
she
did
not
hear
clara
behind
her
relating
to
marguerite
a
story
of
madame
frédéric
mysterious
the
manner
in
which
she
went
out
of
her
way
night
and
morning
so
as
to
pass
through
the
passage
choiseul
and
thus
make
people
believe
that
she
lived
over
the
water
here
are
our
latest
designs
said
denise
we
have
them
in
several
colours
she
laid
out
four
or
five
cloaks
madame
desforges
looked
at
them
with
a
scornful
air
and
became
harsher
at
each
fresh
one
that
she
examined
what
was
the
reason
of
those
pleats
which
made
the
garment
look
so
scanty
and
that
other
one
square
across
the
shoulders
why
you
might
have
thought
it
had
been
cut
out
with
a
hatchet
though
people
went
travelling
they
could
not
dress
like
show
me
something
else
mademoiselle
denise
unfolded
and
refolded
the
garments
without
the
slightest
sign
of
ill
temper
and
it
was
just
this
calm
serene
patience
which
exasperated
madame
desforges
the
more
her
glances
continually
returned
to
the
glass
in
front
of
her
now
that
she
saw
herself
there
close
to
denise
she
ventured
on
a
comparison
was
it
possible
that
he
should
prefer
that
insignificant
creature
to
herself
she
now
remembered
that
this
was
the
girl
whom
she
had
formerly
seen
cutting
such
a
silly
figure
at
the
time
of
her
début
as
clumsy
as
any
peasant
wench
freshly
arrived
from
her
village
no
doubt
she
looked
better
now
stiff
and
correct
in
her
silk
gown
but
how
puny
how
she
was
i
will
show
you
some
other
patterns
madame
said
denise
quietly
when
she
returned
the
scene
began
again
then
it
was
the
cloth
that
was
too
heavy
or
of
no
good
whatever
and
madame
desforges
turned
round
raising
her
voice
and
endeavouring
to
attract
madame
attention
in
the
hope
of
getting
the
girl
a
scolding
but
denise
since
her
return
had
gradually
conquered
the
department
and
now
felt
quite
at
home
in
it
the
had
even
recognised
that
she
possessed
some
rare
and
valuable
qualities
as
a
saleswoman
a
stubborn
sweetness
a
smiling
force
of
conviction
and
thus
when
madame
aurélie
heard
madame
desforges
she
simply
shrugged
her
shoulders
taking
care
not
to
interfere
would
you
kindly
tell
me
the
kind
of
garment
you
require
madame
asked
denise
once
more
with
her
polite
persistence
which
nothing
could
discourage
but
you
got
nothing
exclaimed
madame
desforges
she
stopped
short
surprised
to
feel
a
hand
laid
on
her
shoulder
it
was
the
hand
of
madame
marty
who
was
being
carried
through
the
establishment
by
her
fever
for
spending
since
the
cravats
the
embroidered
gloves
and
the
red
parasol
her
purchases
had
increased
to
such
an
extent
that
the
last
salesman
had
just
decided
to
place
them
all
on
a
chair
as
to
have
carried
them
on
his
arm
might
have
broken
it
and
he
walked
in
front
of
her
drawing
along
the
chair
upon
which
petticoats
napkins
curtains
a
lamp
and
three
straw
hats
were
heaped
together
ah
said
she
you
are
buying
a
travelling
cloak
oh
dear
no
replied
madame
desforges
they
are
frightful
however
madame
marty
had
just
noticed
a
striped
cloak
which
she
rather
liked
her
daughter
valentine
was
already
examining
it
so
denise
called
marguerite
to
clear
the
article
out
of
the
department
it
being
one
of
the
previous
year
patterns
and
marguerite
at
a
glance
from
her
comrade
presented
it
as
an
exceptional
bargain
when
she
had
sworn
that
they
had
twice
lowered
the
price
that
they
had
reduced
it
from
a
hundred
and
fifty
francs
to
a
hundred
and
thirty
and
that
it
was
now
ticketed
at
a
hundred
and
ten
madame
marty
could
not
withstand
the
temptation
of
its
cheapness
she
bought
it
and
the
salesman
who
accompanied
her
thereupon
went
off
leaving
the
chair
and
the
parcels
behind
him
with
all
the
attached
to
the
goods
whilst
marguerite
was
debiting
the
cloak
madame
marty
turned
her
head
and
on
catching
sight
of
clara
made
a
slight
sign
to
madame
desforges
then
whispered
to
her
monsieur
mouret
caprice
you
know
the
other
in
surprise
looked
round
at
clara
and
then
after
again
turning
her
eyes
on
denise
replied
but
it
is
the
tall
one
the
little
one
and
as
madame
marty
could
not
be
sure
which
of
the
two
it
was
madame
desforges
resumed
aloud
with
the
scorn
of
a
lady
for
chambermaids
perhaps
both
denise
had
heard
everything
and
raised
her
large
pure
eyes
on
this
lady
who
was
thus
wounding
her
and
whom
she
did
not
know
no
doubt
it
was
the
lady
of
whom
people
had
spoken
to
her
the
lady
with
whom
mouret
name
was
so
often
associated
in
the
glances
that
were
exchanged
between
them
denise
displayed
such
melancholy
dignity
such
frank
innocence
that
henriette
felt
quite
uncomfortable
as
you
have
nothing
presentable
to
show
me
here
conduct
me
to
the
dress
and
costume
department
she
said
all
at
once
i
go
with
you
as
well
exclaimed
madame
marty
i
wanted
to
see
a
costume
for
valentine
marguerite
thereupon
took
the
chair
by
its
back
and
dragged
it
along
on
its
hind
legs
which
were
getting
rather
worn
by
this
species
of
locomotion
denise
on
her
side
only
carried
the
few
yards
of
silk
bought
by
madame
desforges
they
had
however
quite
a
journey
before
them
now
that
the
robes
and
costumes
were
installed
on
the
second
floor
at
the
other
end
of
the
establishment
and
the
long
walk
commenced
along
the
crowded
galleries
marguerite
went
in
front
drawing
the
chair
along
like
some
little
vehicle
and
slowly
opening
a
passage
as
soon
as
she
reached
the
department
madame
desforges
began
to
complain
was
it
ridiculous
a
shop
where
you
were
obliged
to
walk
a
couple
of
leagues
to
find
the
least
thing
madame
marty
also
declared
that
she
was
tired
to
death
yet
she
none
the
less
enjoyed
this
fatigue
this
slow
exhaustion
of
strength
amidst
the
inexhaustible
wealth
of
merchandise
displayed
on
every
side
mouret
idea
full
of
genius
had
absolutely
subjugated
her
and
she
paused
in
each
fresh
department
she
made
a
first
halt
before
the
trousseaux
tempted
by
some
chemises
which
pauline
sold
her
and
marguerite
then
found
herself
relieved
of
the
burden
of
the
chair
which
pauline
had
to
take
with
the
madame
desforges
might
have
gone
on
her
way
and
thus
have
liberated
denise
more
speedily
but
she
seemed
happy
to
feel
her
behind
her
motionless
and
patient
whilst
she
also
lingered
advising
her
friend
in
the
department
the
ladies
went
into
ecstasies
but
of
course
without
buying
anything
then
madame
marty
weaknesses
began
anew
she
succumbed
successively
before
a
black
silk
corset
a
pair
of
fur
cuffs
sold
at
a
reduction
on
account
of
the
lateness
of
the
season
and
some
russian
lace
much
in
vogue
at
that
time
for
trimming
all
these
things
were
heaped
up
on
the
chair
the
number
of
parcels
still
increased
making
the
chair
creak
and
the
salesmen
who
succeeded
one
another
found
it
more
and
more
difficult
to
drag
the
improvised
vehicle
along
as
its
load
became
heavier
and
heavier
this
way
madame
said
denise
without
a
murmur
after
each
halt
but
it
absurd
exclaimed
madame
desforges
we
shall
never
get
there
why
did
they
not
put
the
dresses
and
costumes
near
the
mantles
department
it
a
mess
madame
marty
whose
eyes
were
sparkling
intoxicated
by
the
succession
of
riches
dancing
before
her
repeated
in
an
undertone
oh
dear
what
will
my
husband
say
you
are
right
there
is
no
order
in
this
place
a
person
loses
herself
and
commits
all
sorts
of
follies
on
the
great
central
landing
there
was
scarcely
room
for
the
chair
to
pass
as
mouret
had
just
blocked
the
open
space
with
a
lot
of
fancy
goods
cups
mounted
on
gilt
zinc
flash
and
liqueur
stands
being
of
opinion
that
the
crowd
there
was
not
sufficiently
great
and
that
circulation
was
too
easy
and
he
had
also
authorized
one
of
his
shopmen
to
exhibit
on
a
small
table
there
some
chinese
and
japanese
curiosities
which
customers
eagerly
snatched
up
it
was
an
unexpected
success
and
he
already
thought
of
extending
this
branch
of
his
business
whilst
two
messengers
carried
the
chair
up
to
the
second
floor
madame
marty
purchased
six
ivory
studs
some
silk
mice
and
a
lacquered
on
the
second
floor
the
journey
began
afresh
denise
who
had
been
showing
customers
about
in
this
way
ever
since
the
morning
was
sinking
with
fatigue
but
she
still
continued
correct
gentle
and
polite
she
again
had
to
wait
for
the
ladies
in
the
furnishing
materials
department
where
a
delightful
cretonne
had
caught
madame
marty
eye
then
in
the
furniture
department
a
took
her
fancy
her
hands
trembled
and
with
a
laugh
she
was
entreating
madame
desforges
to
prevent
her
from
spending
any
more
money
when
a
meeting
with
madame
guibal
furnished
her
with
an
excuse
to
continue
her
purchases
the
meeting
took
place
in
the
carpet
department
whither
madame
guibal
had
gone
to
return
some
oriental
which
she
had
purchased
five
days
previously
and
she
was
standing
there
talking
to
the
salesman
a
brawny
fellow
with
sinewy
arms
who
from
morning
to
night
carried
loads
heavy
enough
to
break
a
bullock
back
naturally
he
was
in
consternation
at
this
return
which
deprived
him
of
his
commission
and
so
did
his
best
to
embarrass
his
customer
suspecting
some
queer
adventure
no
doubt
a
ball
given
with
these
curtains
bought
at
the
ladies
paradise
and
then
returned
to
avoid
the
cost
of
hire
at
an
upholsterer
he
knew
indeed
that
this
was
frequently
done
by
the
economical
people
in
short
she
must
have
some
reason
for
returning
them
if
she
did
not
like
the
designs
or
the
colours
he
would
show
her
others
he
had
a
most
complete
assortment
to
all
these
insinuations
however
madame
guibal
with
queenly
assurance
replied
quietly
that
the
curtains
did
not
suit
her
and
she
did
not
deign
to
add
any
explanation
she
refused
to
look
at
any
others
and
he
was
obliged
to
give
way
for
the
salesmen
had
orders
to
take
the
goods
back
even
if
they
saw
that
they
had
been
used
as
the
three
ladies
went
off
together
and
madame
marty
referred
remorsefully
to
the
for
which
she
had
no
earthly
need
madame
guibal
said
in
her
calm
voice
well
you
can
return
it
you
saw
it
was
quite
easy
meantime
let
them
send
it
to
your
house
you
can
put
it
in
your
keep
it
for
a
time
and
then
if
you
do
like
it
return
it
ah
that
a
good
idea
exclaimed
madame
marty
if
my
husband
makes
too
much
fuss
i
send
everything
back
this
was
for
her
the
supreme
excuse
she
ceased
calculating
and
went
on
buying
with
the
secret
wish
however
to
keep
everything
for
she
was
not
one
of
those
women
who
give
things
back
at
last
they
arrived
in
the
dress
and
costume
department
but
as
denise
was
about
to
deliver
to
another
young
lady
the
silk
which
madame
desforges
had
purchased
the
latter
seemed
to
change
her
mind
and
declared
that
she
would
decidedly
take
one
of
the
travelling
cloaks
the
light
grey
one
with
the
hood
and
denise
then
had
to
wait
complacently
till
she
was
ready
to
return
to
the
mantle
department
the
girl
felt
that
she
was
being
treated
like
a
servant
by
this
imperious
whimsical
customer
but
she
had
vowed
to
do
her
duty
and
retained
her
calm
demeanour
notwithstanding
the
rising
of
her
heart
and
rebellion
of
her
pride
madame
desforges
bought
nothing
in
the
dress
and
costume
department
oh
mamma
said
valentine
if
that
little
costume
should
only
fit
me
in
a
low
tone
madame
guibal
was
explaining
her
tactics
to
madame
marty
when
she
saw
a
dress
she
liked
in
a
shop
she
had
it
sent
home
took
a
pattern
of
it
and
then
sent
it
back
and
thereupon
madame
marty
bought
the
costume
for
her
daughter
remarking
a
good
idea
you
are
very
practical
my
dear
madame
they
had
been
obliged
to
abandon
the
chair
it
had
been
left
in
distress
in
the
furniture
department
beside
the
for
its
weight
had
become
too
great
and
its
hind
legs
threatened
to
break
off
so
it
was
arranged
that
all
the
purchases
should
be
centralized
at
one
and
thence
sent
down
to
the
delivery
department
and
then
the
ladies
still
accompanied
by
denise
began
roaming
all
over
the
establishment
making
a
second
appearance
in
nearly
every
department
they
were
ever
on
the
stairs
and
in
the
galleries
and
at
each
moment
some
fresh
meeting
brought
them
to
a
standstill
thus
near
the
they
once
more
came
across
madame
bourdelais
and
her
three
children
the
youngsters
were
loaded
with
parcels
madeleine
had
a
dress
for
herself
under
her
arm
edmond
was
carrying
a
collection
of
little
shoes
whilst
the
youngest
lucien
was
wearing
a
new
cap
you
as
well
said
madame
desforges
laughingly
to
her
old
pray
do
speak
of
it
exclaimed
madame
bourdelais
i
furious
they
get
hold
of
us
by
the
little
ones
now
you
know
how
little
i
spend
on
myself
but
how
can
you
expect
me
to
resist
the
entreaties
of
these
children
who
want
everything
i
merely
came
to
show
them
round
and
here
am
i
plundering
the
whole
establishment
mouret
who
still
happened
to
be
there
with
vallagnosc
and
monsieur
de
boves
listened
to
her
with
a
smile
she
observed
it
and
complained
gaily
though
with
an
undercurrent
of
real
irritation
of
these
traps
laid
for
a
mother
affection
the
idea
that
she
had
just
yielded
to
the
force
of
puffery
raised
her
indignation
and
he
still
smiling
bowed
fully
enjoying
his
triumph
monsieur
de
boves
meanwhile
had
manœuvred
so
as
to
get
near
madame
guibal
whom
he
ultimately
followed
for
the
second
time
trying
to
lose
vallagnosc
but
the
latter
weary
of
the
crush
hastened
to
rejoin
him
and
now
once
more
denise
was
brought
to
a
standstill
obliged
to
wait
for
the
ladies
she
turned
her
back
and
mouret
himself
affected
not
to
see
her
but
from
that
moment
madame
desforges
with
the
delicate
scent
of
a
jealous
woman
had
no
further
doubt
whilst
he
was
complimenting
her
and
walking
beside
her
like
a
gallant
host
she
became
deeply
absorbed
in
thought
wondering
how
she
could
convict
him
of
his
treason
meanwhile
monsieur
de
boves
and
vallagnosc
who
had
gone
on
in
front
with
madame
guibal
reached
the
lace
department
a
luxurious
room
surrounded
by
nests
of
carved
oak
drawers
which
were
constantly
being
opened
and
shut
around
the
columns
covered
with
red
velvet
spirals
of
white
lace
ascended
and
from
one
to
the
other
end
of
the
department
hung
festoons
of
guipure
whilst
on
the
counters
were
quantities
of
large
cards
wound
round
with
valenciennes
malines
and
point
at
the
further
end
two
ladies
were
seated
before
a
mauve
silk
on
which
deloche
was
placing
some
pieces
of
chantilly
the
ladies
meantime
looking
on
in
silence
and
without
making
up
their
minds
hallo
said
vallagnosc
quite
surprised
you
said
that
madame
de
boves
was
unwell
but
she
is
standing
over
there
near
that
counter
with
mademoiselle
blanche
the
count
could
not
help
starting
back
and
casting
a
side
glance
at
madame
guibal
dear
me
so
she
is
said
he
it
was
very
warm
in
this
room
the
half
stifled
customers
had
pale
faces
with
glittering
eyes
it
seemed
as
if
all
the
seductions
of
the
shop
converged
to
this
supreme
temptation
this
secluded
corner
of
perdition
where
the
strongest
must
succumb
women
plunged
their
hands
into
the
overflowing
heaps
quivering
with
intoxication
at
the
contact
i
fancy
those
ladies
are
ruining
you
resumed
vallagnosc
amused
by
the
meeting
monsieur
de
boves
assumed
the
look
of
a
husband
who
is
perfectly
sure
of
his
wife
discretion
from
the
simple
fact
that
he
does
not
give
her
a
copper
to
spend
the
countess
after
wandering
through
all
the
departments
with
her
daughter
without
buying
anything
had
just
stranded
in
the
lace
department
in
a
rage
of
unsated
desire
overcome
with
fatigue
she
was
leaning
against
the
counter
while
her
clammy
hands
dived
into
a
heap
of
lace
whence
a
warmth
rose
to
her
shoulders
then
suddenly
just
as
her
daughter
turned
her
head
and
the
salesman
went
away
it
occurred
to
her
to
slip
a
piece
of
point
under
her
mantle
but
she
shuddered
and
dropped
it
on
hearing
vallagnosc
gaily
saying
ah
we
caught
you
madame
for
several
seconds
she
stood
there
speechless
and
very
pale
then
she
explained
that
feeling
much
better
she
had
thought
she
would
take
a
stroll
and
on
noticing
that
her
husband
was
with
madame
guibal
she
quite
recovered
herself
and
looked
at
them
with
such
a
dignified
air
that
the
other
lady
felt
obliged
to
say
i
was
with
madame
desforges
these
gentlemen
just
met
us
as
it
happened
the
other
ladies
came
up
just
at
that
moment
accompanied
by
mouret
who
again
detained
them
to
point
out
jouve
who
was
still
following
the
suspicious
woman
and
her
lady
friend
it
was
very
curious
said
he
they
could
not
form
an
idea
of
the
number
of
thieves
arrested
in
the
lace
department
madame
de
boves
who
was
listening
fancied
herself
between
a
couple
of
gendarmes
with
her
years
her
luxury
and
her
husband
high
position
however
she
felt
no
remorse
but
reflected
that
she
ought
to
have
slipped
the
lace
up
her
sleeve
jouve
however
had
just
decided
to
lay
hold
of
the
suspicious
woman
despairing
of
catching
her
in
the
act
but
fully
suspecting
that
she
had
filled
her
pockets
by
means
of
some
sleight
of
hand
which
had
escaped
him
but
when
he
had
taken
her
aside
and
searched
her
he
was
wild
with
confusion
at
finding
nothing
on
her
not
a
cravat
not
a
button
her
friend
had
disappeared
all
at
once
he
understood
the
woman
he
had
searched
had
only
been
there
as
a
blind
it
was
the
friend
who
had
done
the
trick
this
affair
amused
the
ladies
mouret
rather
vexed
merely
said
old
jouve
has
been
floored
this
time
but
he
have
his
revenge
oh
replied
vallagnosc
i
do
think
he
equal
to
it
besides
why
do
you
display
such
a
quantity
of
goods
it
serves
you
right
if
you
are
robbed
you
ought
not
to
tempt
these
poor
defenceless
women
so
this
was
the
last
word
which
sounded
like
the
supreme
note
of
the
day
in
the
growing
fever
that
reigned
in
the
establishment
the
ladies
separated
crossing
the
crowded
departments
for
the
last
time
it
was
four
the
rays
of
the
setting
sun
were
darting
obliquely
through
the
large
front
windows
and
throwing
a
cross
light
on
the
glazed
roofs
of
the
halls
and
in
this
red
fiery
glow
arose
like
a
golden
vapour
the
thick
dust
raised
by
the
circulation
of
the
crowd
since
early
morning
a
broad
sheet
of
light
streamed
along
the
grand
central
gallery
showing
up
the
staircases
the
flying
bridges
all
the
network
of
suspended
iron
the
mosaics
and
faiences
of
the
friezes
glittered
the
green
and
red
paint
reflected
the
fire
of
the
lavish
gilding
the
paradise
seemed
like
a
furnace
in
which
the
various
displays
the
palaces
of
gloves
and
cravats
the
festoons
of
ribbons
and
laces
the
lofty
piles
of
linen
and
calico
the
variegated
parterres
in
which
bloomed
the
light
silks
and
foulards
were
now
burning
the
exhibition
of
parasols
of
roundness
threw
forth
metallic
reflections
in
the
distance
beyond
streaks
of
shadow
were
counters
sparkling
and
swarming
with
a
throng
ablaze
with
sunshine
and
at
this
last
moment
in
this
atmosphere
the
women
reigned
supreme
they
had
taken
the
whole
place
by
storm
they
were
camping
there
as
in
a
conquered
country
like
an
invading
horde
installed
amidst
all
the
disorder
of
the
goods
the
salesmen
deafened
and
exhausted
were
now
nothing
but
their
slaves
of
whom
they
disposed
with
sovereign
tyranny
fat
women
elbowed
their
way
along
even
the
thinnest
took
up
a
deal
of
space
and
became
quite
arrogant
they
were
all
there
with
heads
erect
and
gestures
abrupt
quite
at
home
not
showing
the
slightest
politeness
to
one
another
but
making
as
much
use
of
the
house
as
they
could
even
to
the
point
of
carrying
away
the
dust
from
its
walls
madame
bourdelais
desirous
of
making
up
for
her
expenditure
had
again
taken
her
children
to
the
refreshment
bar
whither
the
crowd
was
now
rushing
with
rageful
thirst
and
appetite
even
the
mothers
were
gorging
themselves
with
malaga
since
the
morning
eighty
quarts
of
syrup
and
seventy
bottles
of
wine
had
been
drunk
after
purchasing
her
travelling
cloak
madame
desforges
had
secured
some
picture
cards
at
the
and
she
went
away
scheming
how
she
might
get
denise
into
her
house
so
as
to
humiliate
her
before
mouret
himself
see
their
faces
and
arrive
at
a
conclusion
and
whilst
monsieur
de
boves
succeeded
at
last
in
plunging
into
the
crowd
and
disappearing
with
madame
guibal
madame
de
boves
followed
by
blanche
and
vallagnosc
had
the
fancy
to
ask
for
a
red
although
she
had
bought
nothing
it
would
always
be
something
she
would
not
go
away
she
would
make
a
friend
of
her
doorkeeper
little
girl
with
it
at
the
distributing
counter
they
were
just
starting
on
the
fortieth
thousand
thirty
nine
thousand
red
had
already
taken
flight
in
the
warm
atmosphere
of
the
shop
a
perfect
cloud
of
red
which
were
now
floating
from
one
end
of
paris
to
the
other
bearing
upwards
to
the
sky
the
name
of
the
ladies
paradise
five
struck
of
all
the
ladies
madame
marty
and
her
daughter
were
the
only
ones
to
remain
in
the
final
throes
of
the
day
sales
although
ready
to
drop
with
fatigue
she
could
not
tear
herself
away
being
retained
by
so
strong
an
attraction
that
although
she
needed
nothing
she
continually
retraced
her
steps
scouring
the
departments
with
insatiable
curiosity
it
was
the
moment
in
which
the
throng
goaded
on
by
puffery
completely
lost
its
head
the
sixty
thousand
francs
paid
to
the
newspapers
the
ten
thousand
bills
posted
on
the
walls
the
two
hundred
thousand
catalogues
distributed
all
over
the
world
after
emptying
the
women
purses
left
their
minds
weakened
by
intoxication
and
they
still
remained
shaken
by
mouret
inventions
the
reduction
of
prices
the
returns
and
the
endless
gallantries
madame
marty
lingered
before
the
various
proposal
stalls
amidst
the
hoarse
cries
of
the
salesmen
the
clink
of
the
and
the
rolling
of
the
parcels
sent
down
to
the
basement
she
again
traversed
the
ground
floor
the
linen
silk
glove
and
woollen
departments
she
again
went
upstairs
yielding
to
the
metallic
vibrations
of
the
hanging
staircases
and
she
returned
to
the
mantle
and
lace
departments
she
even
ascended
to
the
second
floor
to
the
heights
of
the
bedding
and
furniture
galleries
and
on
all
sides
the
employees
hutin
and
favier
mignot
and
liénard
deloche
pauline
and
denise
nearly
dead
with
fatigue
were
making
a
final
effort
snatching
victories
from
the
last
fever
of
the
customers
this
fever
had
gradually
increased
since
the
morning
like
the
intoxication
emanating
from
all
the
tumbled
stuffs
the
crowd
flared
under
the
fiery
glare
of
the
five
sun
madame
marty
now
had
the
animated
nervous
face
of
a
child
after
drinking
pure
wine
arriving
with
clear
eyes
and
fresh
skin
from
the
cold
of
the
street
she
had
slowly
burnt
both
sight
and
complexion
by
the
contemplation
of
all
that
luxury
those
violent
colours
whose
everlasting
gallop
irritated
her
passion
when
she
at
last
went
away
after
saying
that
she
would
pay
at
home
terrified
as
she
was
by
the
amount
of
her
bill
her
features
were
drawn
and
her
eyes
dilated
like
those
of
a
sick
person
she
was
obliged
to
fight
her
way
through
the
stubborn
crush
at
the
door
where
people
were
almost
killing
each
other
amidst
the
struggle
for
bargains
then
when
she
got
into
the
street
and
again
found
her
daughter
whom
she
had
lost
for
a
moment
the
fresh
air
made
her
shiver
and
she
remained
quite
scared
her
mind
unhinged
by
the
neurosis
to
which
the
great
drapery
establishments
give
birth
in
the
evening
as
denise
was
returning
from
dinner
a
messenger
called
her
you
are
wanted
at
the
director
office
mademoiselle
she
had
forgotten
the
order
which
mouret
had
given
her
in
the
morning
to
go
to
his
office
when
the
sale
was
over
she
found
him
standing
waiting
for
her
on
going
in
she
did
not
close
the
door
which
remained
wide
open
we
are
very
pleased
with
you
mademoiselle
said
he
and
we
have
thought
of
proving
our
satisfaction
you
know
in
what
a
shameful
manner
madame
frédéric
has
left
us
from
you
will
take
her
place
as
denise
listened
to
him
motionless
with
surprise
then
she
murmured
in
a
trembling
voice
but
there
are
saleswomen
in
the
department
who
are
much
my
seniors
sir
what
does
that
matter
he
resumed
you
are
the
most
capable
the
most
trustworthy
i
select
you
it
quite
natural
are
you
not
satisfied
she
blushed
feeling
a
delicious
happiness
and
embarrassment
in
which
all
her
original
fright
vanished
why
had
she
before
aught
else
thought
of
the
suppositions
with
which
this
favour
would
be
received
and
she
remained
there
full
of
confusion
despite
her
sudden
burst
of
gratitude
with
a
smile
he
looked
at
her
in
her
simple
silk
dress
without
a
single
piece
of
jewellery
displaying
only
the
luxury
of
her
royal
blonde
hair
she
had
become
more
refined
her
skin
was
whiter
her
manner
delicate
and
grave
her
former
puny
insignificance
was
developing
into
a
penetrating
gentle
charm
you
are
very
kind
sir
she
stammered
i
do
know
how
to
tell
you
but
she
was
cut
short
by
the
appearance
of
lhomme
on
the
threshold
in
his
hand
he
held
a
large
leather
bag
and
with
his
mutilated
arm
he
pressed
an
enormous
note
case
to
his
chest
whilst
behind
him
came
his
son
albert
weighed
down
by
the
load
of
bags
he
was
carrying
five
hundred
and
thousand
two
hundred
and
ten
francs
thirty
centimes
exclaimed
the
cashier
whose
flabby
worn
face
seemed
to
light
up
with
a
ray
of
sunshine
in
the
reflection
of
such
a
huge
sum
of
money
it
was
the
day
receipts
the
highest
that
the
ladies
paradise
had
ever
attained
in
the
distance
in
the
depths
of
the
shop
through
which
lhomme
had
just
slowly
passed
with
the
heavy
gait
of
an
overladen
beast
of
burden
you
could
hear
the
uproar
the
ripple
of
surprise
and
joy
which
this
colossal
sum
had
left
behind
it
as
it
passed
why
it
superb
said
mouret
enchanted
my
good
lhomme
put
it
down
there
and
take
a
rest
for
you
look
quite
done
up
i
have
the
money
taken
to
the
central
cashier
office
yes
yes
put
it
all
on
my
table
i
want
to
see
the
heap
he
was
full
of
a
childish
gaiety
the
cashier
and
his
son
rid
themselves
of
their
burdens
the
leather
bag
gave
out
a
clear
golden
ring
two
of
the
other
bags
in
bursting
let
a
torrent
of
silver
and
copper
escape
whilst
from
the
peeped
the
corners
of
bank
notes
one
end
of
the
large
table
was
entirely
covered
it
was
like
the
tumbling
of
a
fortune
picked
up
in
ten
hours
when
lhomme
and
albert
had
retired
mopping
their
faces
mouret
remained
for
a
moment
motionless
dreamy
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
money
but
on
raising
his
head
he
perceived
denise
who
had
drawn
back
then
he
began
to
smile
again
forced
her
to
come
forward
and
finished
by
saying
that
he
would
make
her
a
present
of
all
the
money
she
could
take
in
her
hand
and
there
was
a
sort
of
love
bargain
beneath
his
playfulness
look
out
of
the
bag
i
bet
it
would
be
less
than
a
thousand
francs
your
hand
is
so
small
but
she
drew
back
again
he
loved
her
then
suddenly
she
understood
everything
she
felt
the
growing
flame
of
desire
with
which
he
had
enveloped
her
ever
since
her
return
to
the
shop
what
overcame
her
more
than
anything
else
was
to
feel
her
heart
beating
violently
why
did
he
wound
her
with
the
offer
of
all
that
money
when
she
was
overflowing
with
gratitude
he
was
stepping
nearer
to
her
still
continuing
to
joke
when
to
his
great
annoyance
bourdoncle
came
in
under
the
pretence
of
informing
him
of
the
enormous
number
of
entries
no
fewer
than
seventy
thousand
customers
had
entered
the
ladies
paradise
that
day
and
thereupon
denise
hastened
off
after
again
expressing
her
thanks
chapter
x
on
the
first
sunday
in
august
the
which
had
to
be
finished
by
the
evening
took
place
early
in
the
morning
all
the
employees
were
at
their
posts
as
on
a
and
the
work
began
with
closed
doors
not
a
customer
was
admitted
denise
however
had
not
come
down
with
the
other
young
ladies
at
eight
confined
to
her
room
since
the
previous
thursday
through
having
sprained
her
ankle
whilst
on
her
way
up
to
the
she
was
now
much
better
but
as
madame
aurélie
treated
her
indulgently
she
did
not
hurry
down
still
after
a
deal
of
trouble
she
managed
to
put
her
boots
on
having
resolved
that
she
would
show
herself
in
the
department
the
young
ladies
now
occupied
the
entire
fifth
storey
of
the
new
buildings
in
the
rue
monsigny
there
were
sixty
of
them
on
either
side
of
a
corridor
and
they
were
much
more
comfortable
than
formerly
although
still
furnished
simply
with
an
iron
bedstead
large
wardrobe
and
little
mahogany
the
private
life
of
the
saleswomen
was
now
becoming
more
refined
and
elegant
they
displayed
a
taste
for
scented
soap
and
fine
linen
quite
a
natural
ascent
towards
ways
as
their
positions
improved
although
high
words
and
banging
doors
were
still
sometimes
heard
amidst
the
gust
that
carried
them
away
morning
and
evening
denise
being
in
her
department
had
one
of
the
largest
rooms
with
two
attic
windows
looking
into
the
street
being
now
in
much
better
circumstances
she
indulged
in
sundry
little
luxuries
a
red
bed
quilt
covered
with
guipure
a
small
carpet
in
front
of
her
wardrobe
a
couple
of
vases
containing
a
few
fading
roses
on
her
toilet
table
when
she
had
succeeded
in
getting
her
boots
on
she
tried
to
walk
across
the
room
but
was
obliged
to
lean
against
the
furniture
being
still
rather
lame
however
that
would
soon
come
right
again
she
thought
at
the
same
time
she
had
been
quite
right
in
refusing
an
invitation
to
dine
at
uncle
baudu
that
evening
and
in
asking
her
aunt
to
take
pépé
out
for
a
walk
for
she
had
placed
him
with
madame
gras
again
jean
who
had
been
to
see
her
on
the
previous
day
was
also
to
dine
at
his
uncle
she
was
still
slowly
trying
to
walk
resolving
however
to
go
to
bed
early
in
order
to
rest
her
ankle
when
madame
cabin
the
housekeeper
knocked
and
gave
her
a
letter
with
an
air
of
mystery
the
door
closed
denise
astonished
by
the
woman
discreet
smile
opened
the
letter
and
at
once
she
dropped
on
a
chair
for
it
was
a
letter
from
mouret
in
which
he
expressed
himself
delighted
at
her
recovery
and
begged
her
to
come
down
and
dine
with
him
that
evening
since
she
could
not
go
out
the
tone
of
this
note
at
once
familiar
and
paternal
was
in
no
way
offensive
but
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
mistake
its
meaning
and
thus
her
white
cheeks
slowly
coloured
with
a
flush
with
the
letter
lying
on
her
lap
and
her
heart
beating
violently
she
remained
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
blinding
light
which
came
in
by
one
of
the
windows
there
was
a
confession
which
she
had
been
obliged
to
make
to
herself
in
this
very
room
during
her
sleepless
hours
if
she
still
trembled
when
he
passed
she
now
knew
that
it
was
not
from
fear
and
her
former
uneasiness
her
old
terror
could
have
been
only
the
frightened
ignorance
of
love
the
perturbation
of
passion
springing
up
amidst
her
youthful
wildness
she
did
not
reason
she
simply
felt
that
she
had
always
loved
him
from
the
hour
when
she
had
shuddered
and
stammered
before
him
she
had
loved
him
when
she
had
feared
him
as
a
pitiless
master
she
had
loved
him
when
her
distracted
heart
was
dreaming
of
hutin
unconsciously
yielding
to
a
desire
for
affection
yes
she
had
never
loved
any
but
this
man
whose
mere
look
terrified
her
and
all
her
past
life
came
back
to
her
unfolding
itself
in
the
blinding
light
from
the
window
the
hardships
of
her
start
that
sweet
walk
under
the
dark
foliage
of
the
tuileries
gardens
and
lastly
the
desires
with
which
he
had
enveloped
her
ever
since
her
return
the
letter
dropped
on
the
floor
and
denise
was
still
gazing
at
the
window
dazzled
by
the
glare
of
the
sun
suddenly
there
was
a
knock
and
she
hastened
to
pick
up
the
missive
and
conceal
it
in
her
pocket
it
was
pauline
who
having
slipped
away
from
her
department
under
some
pretext
or
other
had
come
up
for
a
little
chat
how
are
you
my
dear
we
never
meet
now
as
it
was
against
the
rules
however
to
go
up
into
the
and
above
all
for
two
of
the
saleswomen
to
be
shut
in
together
denise
took
her
friend
to
the
end
of
the
passage
to
a
saloon
which
mouret
had
gallantly
fitted
up
for
the
young
ladies
who
could
spend
their
evenings
there
chatting
or
sewing
till
eleven
the
apartment
decorated
in
white
and
gold
with
the
vulgar
nudity
of
an
hotel
room
was
furnished
with
a
piano
a
central
table
and
some
and
sofas
protected
by
white
covers
after
spending
a
few
evenings
together
there
in
the
first
novelty
of
the
thing
the
saleswomen
now
never
entered
the
place
without
coming
to
high
words
at
once
they
required
educating
to
it
so
far
their
little
circle
lacked
harmony
meanwhile
almost
the
only
girl
that
went
there
in
the
evening
was
the
of
the
corset
department
miss
powell
who
strummed
away
at
chopin
on
the
piano
and
whose
envied
talents
were
for
much
in
driving
the
others
away
you
see
my
ankle
better
now
said
denise
i
was
just
going
down
well
exclaimed
the
other
how
zealous
you
are
i
take
it
easy
if
i
had
the
chance
they
had
both
sat
down
on
a
sofa
pauline
manner
had
changed
since
her
friend
had
become
in
the
mantle
department
with
her
cordiality
there
mingled
a
touch
of
respect
a
sort
of
surprise
at
realizing
that
the
puny
little
saleswoman
of
former
days
was
on
the
road
to
fortune
denise
however
liked
her
very
much
and
amidst
the
continual
gallop
of
the
two
hundred
women
that
the
firm
now
employed
confided
in
her
alone
what
the
matter
asked
pauline
quickly
when
she
remarked
her
companion
troubled
looks
oh
nothing
replied
denise
with
an
awkward
smile
yes
yes
there
something
the
matter
with
you
have
you
no
faith
in
me
that
you
have
given
up
telling
me
your
worries
thereupon
denise
in
the
emotion
that
was
swelling
her
bosom
an
emotion
she
could
not
control
abandoned
herself
to
her
feelings
she
gave
her
friend
the
letter
stammering
look
he
has
just
written
to
me
between
themselves
they
had
never
openly
spoken
of
mouret
but
this
very
silence
was
like
a
confession
of
their
secret
thoughts
pauline
knew
everything
after
having
read
the
letter
she
clasped
denise
in
her
arms
and
softly
murmured
my
dear
to
speak
frankly
i
thought
it
had
all
happened
long
ago
do
be
shocked
i
assure
you
the
whole
shop
must
think
as
i
do
you
see
he
appointed
you
as
so
quickly
and
then
he
always
looking
at
you
it
obvious
she
kissed
her
affectionately
on
the
cheek
and
then
asked
her
you
will
go
this
evening
of
course
denise
looked
at
her
without
replying
and
all
at
once
burst
into
tears
letting
her
head
fall
on
pauline
shoulder
the
latter
was
quite
astonished
come
try
and
calm
yourself
there
nothing
to
upset
you
like
this
she
said
no
no
let
me
be
stammered
denise
if
you
only
knew
what
trouble
i
am
in
since
i
received
that
letter
i
have
felt
beside
myself
let
me
have
a
good
cry
that
will
relieve
me
full
of
pity
though
not
understanding
pauline
endeavoured
to
console
her
declaring
that
she
must
not
worry
for
it
was
quite
certain
that
mouret
had
ceased
to
pay
any
attention
to
clara
whilst
as
for
that
other
lady
friend
of
his
madame
desforges
it
was
probably
all
but
so
much
gossip
denise
listened
and
had
she
been
ignorant
of
her
love
she
could
no
longer
have
doubted
it
after
the
suffering
she
felt
at
the
allusions
to
those
two
women
she
could
again
hear
clara
disagreeable
voice
and
see
madame
desforges
dragging
her
about
the
different
departments
with
all
the
scorn
of
a
rich
lady
for
a
poor
then
the
two
friends
went
on
conversing
and
at
last
denise
in
a
sudden
impulse
exclaimed
but
when
a
man
loves
a
girl
he
ought
to
marry
her
baugé
is
going
to
marry
you
this
was
true
baugé
who
had
left
the
bon
marché
for
the
paradise
was
going
to
marry
her
about
the
middle
of
the
month
bourdoncle
did
not
like
these
married
couples
however
they
had
managed
to
get
the
necessary
permission
and
even
hoped
to
obtain
a
fortnight
holiday
for
their
honeymoon
on
hearing
denise
remark
pauline
laughed
heartily
but
my
dear
said
she
baugé
is
going
to
marry
me
because
he
is
baugé
he
my
equal
that
natural
whereas
monsieur
mouret
do
you
think
that
monsieur
mouret
could
marry
one
of
his
saleswomen
oh
no
oh
no
exclaimed
denise
shocked
by
the
absurdity
of
the
question
and
that
why
he
ought
never
to
have
written
to
me
this
argument
seemed
to
astonish
pauline
her
coarse
face
with
small
tender
eyes
assumed
quite
an
expression
of
maternal
pity
then
she
got
up
opened
the
piano
and
with
one
finger
softly
played
the
air
of
king
dagobert
doubtless
to
enliven
the
situation
the
noises
of
the
street
the
distant
melopœia
of
a
woman
crying
out
green
peas
ascended
to
the
bare
saloon
whose
emptiness
seemed
increased
by
the
white
coverings
of
the
furniture
denise
had
thrown
herself
back
on
the
sofa
her
head
against
the
woodwork
and
shaken
by
a
fresh
flood
of
sobs
which
she
stifled
in
her
handkerchief
again
resumed
pauline
turning
round
really
you
are
not
reasonable
why
did
you
bring
me
here
we
ought
to
have
stopped
in
your
room
she
knelt
down
before
her
and
had
begun
lecturing
her
again
when
a
sound
of
footsteps
was
heard
in
the
passage
and
thereupon
she
ran
to
the
door
and
looked
out
hush
madame
aurélie
she
murmured
i
off
and
just
you
dry
your
eyes
she
need
not
know
what
up
when
denise
was
alone
she
rose
and
forced
back
her
tears
and
her
hands
still
trembling
fearful
of
being
caught
there
weeping
she
closed
the
piano
which
her
friend
had
left
open
however
on
hearing
madame
aurélie
knocking
at
her
door
she
at
once
left
the
what
you
are
up
exclaimed
the
it
very
thoughtless
of
you
my
dear
child
i
just
came
up
to
see
how
you
were
and
to
tell
you
that
we
did
not
require
you
downstairs
denise
assured
her
however
that
she
felt
much
better
and
that
it
would
do
her
good
to
have
some
occupation
i
sha
tire
myself
madame
you
can
put
me
on
a
chair
and
i
do
some
writing
both
then
went
downstairs
madame
aurélie
most
attentive
insisted
on
denise
leaning
on
her
shoulder
she
must
have
noticed
the
young
red
eyes
for
she
was
stealthily
examining
her
no
doubt
she
was
aware
of
much
that
was
going
on
denise
had
gained
an
unexpected
victory
she
had
at
last
conquered
the
department
formerly
she
had
struggled
on
for
six
months
amidst
all
the
torments
of
drudgery
without
disarming
her
comrades
but
now
in
a
few
weeks
she
had
overcome
them
and
saw
them
submissive
and
respectful
around
her
madame
aurélie
sudden
affection
had
greatly
assisted
her
in
this
ungrateful
task
of
propitiating
her
companions
indeed
the
had
taken
the
young
girl
under
her
protection
with
such
warmth
that
the
latter
must
have
been
recommended
to
her
in
a
very
special
manner
however
denise
had
also
brought
her
own
charm
into
play
in
order
to
disarm
her
enemies
the
task
was
all
the
more
difficult
from
the
fact
that
she
had
to
obtain
their
forgiveness
for
her
appointment
to
the
situation
of
the
other
young
ladies
spoke
of
this
at
first
as
an
injustice
and
even
added
a
lot
of
abominable
accusations
but
in
spite
of
their
revolt
the
title
of
influenced
them
and
denise
with
her
promotion
assumed
a
certain
air
of
authority
which
astonished
and
overawed
even
the
most
hostile
spirits
soon
afterwards
she
actually
found
flatterers
amongst
the
new
hands
and
her
sweetness
and
modesty
completed
the
conquest
marguerite
came
over
to
her
side
and
clara
was
the
only
one
to
continue
her
ways
still
venturing
to
allude
to
denise
as
the
unkempt
one
an
insult
in
which
nobody
now
saw
any
fun
during
the
short
time
that
she
had
engaged
mouret
attention
clara
had
profited
by
the
caprice
to
neglect
her
work
being
of
a
wonderfully
idle
gossiping
nature
unfitted
for
any
responsible
duty
nevertheless
she
considered
that
denise
had
robbed
her
of
madame
frédéric
place
she
would
never
have
accepted
it
on
account
of
the
worry
but
she
was
vexed
that
no
attention
had
been
paid
to
her
claims
nine
struck
as
denise
came
down
leaning
on
madame
arm
out
of
doors
an
ardent
blue
sky
was
warming
the
streets
cabs
were
rolling
towards
the
railway
stations
the
whole
population
of
paris
rigged
out
in
sunday
attire
was
streaming
towards
the
suburban
woods
inside
the
paradise
which
the
large
open
bays
flooded
with
sunshine
the
imprisoned
staff
had
just
commenced
they
had
closed
the
doors
and
people
halted
on
the
pavement
looking
through
the
windows
in
astonishment
that
the
shop
should
be
shut
when
such
extraordinary
activity
prevailed
inside
from
one
end
of
the
galleries
to
the
other
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
floor
there
was
a
continual
tramping
of
employees
arms
were
ever
being
raised
and
parcels
were
flying
about
above
their
heads
and
all
this
amidst
a
tempest
of
shouts
and
calling
out
of
figures
ascending
in
confusion
and
becoming
a
deafening
roar
each
of
the
departments
did
its
work
apart
without
troubling
about
its
neighbour
at
this
early
hour
the
shelves
had
hardly
been
touched
there
were
only
a
few
bales
of
goods
on
the
floors
they
must
get
up
a
good
deal
more
steam
if
they
were
to
finish
that
evening
why
have
you
come
down
asked
marguerite
of
denise
you
only
make
yourself
worse
and
we
are
quite
numerous
enough
to
do
the
work
that
what
i
told
her
declared
madame
aurélie
but
she
insisted
on
coming
down
to
help
us
all
the
young
ladies
flocked
round
denise
the
work
was
even
interrupted
for
a
time
they
complimented
her
listening
with
all
sorts
of
exclamations
to
the
story
of
her
sprained
ankle
at
last
madame
aurélie
made
her
sit
down
at
a
table
and
it
was
understood
that
she
should
merely
write
down
the
articles
as
they
were
called
out
on
such
a
day
as
this
they
requisitioned
all
the
employees
who
were
capable
of
holding
a
pen
the
inspectors
the
cashiers
the
clerks
even
the
shop
messengers
and
each
department
annexed
some
of
these
assistants
of
a
day
in
order
to
get
the
work
over
more
quickly
it
was
thus
that
denise
found
herself
installed
near
lhomme
the
cashier
and
joseph
the
messenger
both
of
whom
were
bending
over
large
sheets
of
paper
five
mantles
cloth
fur
trimming
third
size
at
two
hundred
and
forty
francs
called
marguerite
four
ditto
first
size
at
two
hundred
and
twenty
the
work
once
more
commenced
behind
marguerite
three
saleswomen
were
emptying
the
cupboards
classifying
the
articles
and
giving
them
to
her
in
bundles
and
when
she
had
called
them
out
she
threw
them
on
the
table
where
they
were
gradually
accumulating
in
huge
piles
lhomme
jotted
down
the
articles
whilst
joseph
checked
him
by
keeping
another
list
whilst
this
was
going
on
madame
aurélie
herself
assisted
by
three
other
saleswomen
was
counting
out
the
silk
garments
which
denise
entered
on
the
sheets
of
paper
given
to
her
clara
on
her
side
was
looking
after
the
heaps
arranging
them
in
such
a
manner
that
they
should
occupy
the
least
possible
space
on
the
tables
but
she
was
not
paying
much
attention
to
her
work
for
many
things
were
already
tumbling
down
i
say
she
asked
of
a
little
saleswoman
who
had
joined
that
winter
are
they
going
to
give
you
a
rise
you
know
that
the
is
to
have
two
thousand
francs
which
with
her
commission
will
bring
her
in
nearly
seven
thousand
the
little
saleswoman
without
ceasing
to
pass
some
cloaks
down
replied
that
if
they
did
give
her
eight
hundred
francs
she
would
take
her
hook
the
rises
were
always
given
on
the
day
after
the
it
was
also
then
as
the
amount
of
business
done
during
the
year
became
known
that
the
managers
of
the
departments
drew
their
commission
on
the
increase
of
this
amount
as
compared
with
that
of
the
preceding
year
thus
despite
the
bustle
and
uproar
of
the
work
the
impassioned
gossiping
went
on
everywhere
between
every
two
articles
that
were
called
out
they
talked
of
nothing
but
money
the
rumour
ran
that
madame
aurélie
gains
would
exceed
thousand
francs
and
this
huge
sum
greatly
excited
the
young
ladies
marguerite
the
best
saleswoman
after
denise
had
for
her
part
made
four
thousand
five
hundred
francs
that
is
fifteen
hundred
francs
salary
and
about
three
thousand
francs
commission
whilst
clara
had
not
made
two
thousand
five
hundred
altogether
i
do
care
a
button
for
their
rises
she
resumed
still
talking
to
the
little
saleswoman
if
papa
were
dead
i
would
jolly
soon
clear
out
of
this
still
it
exasperates
me
to
see
seven
thousand
francs
given
to
that
strip
of
a
girl
what
do
you
say
madame
aurélie
turning
round
with
her
imperial
air
violently
interrupted
the
conversation
be
quiet
young
ladies
we
ca
hear
ourselves
speak
my
word
of
honour
then
she
again
went
on
calling
out
seven
mantles
old
style
sicilian
first
size
at
a
hundred
and
thirty
three
pelisses
surah
second
size
at
a
hundred
and
fifty
have
you
got
that
down
mademoiselle
baudu
yes
madame
clara
then
had
to
look
after
the
armfuls
of
garments
piled
upon
the
tables
she
pushed
them
about
and
made
some
more
room
but
she
soon
left
them
again
to
reply
to
a
salesman
who
was
looking
for
her
it
was
the
glover
mignot
who
had
escaped
from
his
department
he
whispered
a
request
for
twenty
francs
he
already
owed
her
thirty
a
loan
effected
on
the
day
after
some
races
when
he
had
lost
his
week
money
on
a
horse
this
time
he
had
squandered
his
commission
drawn
overnight
and
had
not
ten
sous
left
him
for
his
sunday
clara
had
only
ten
francs
about
her
and
she
lent
them
with
a
fairly
good
grace
and
they
then
went
on
talking
of
a
party
of
six
which
they
had
formed
part
of
at
a
restaurant
at
bougival
where
the
women
had
paid
their
shares
it
was
much
better
to
do
that
they
all
felt
more
at
ease
next
mignot
who
wanted
his
twenty
francs
went
and
bent
over
lhomme
shoulder
the
latter
stopped
in
his
writing
appeared
greatly
troubled
however
he
dared
not
refuse
and
was
looking
for
a
piece
in
his
purse
when
madame
aurélie
astonished
at
not
hearing
the
voice
of
marguerite
who
had
been
obliged
to
pause
perceived
mignot
and
understood
everything
she
roughly
sent
him
back
to
his
department
saying
that
she
did
want
any
one
to
come
and
distract
her
young
ladies
attention
from
their
work
the
truth
was
she
dreaded
this
young
man
a
bosom
friend
of
albert
and
his
accomplice
in
all
sorts
of
questionable
pranks
which
she
feared
would
some
day
turn
out
badly
accordingly
when
mignot
had
got
his
ten
francs
and
run
away
she
could
not
help
saying
to
her
husband
is
it
possible
to
let
a
fellow
like
that
get
over
you
but
my
dear
i
really
could
refuse
the
young
man
she
closed
his
mouth
with
a
shrug
of
her
substantial
shoulders
then
as
the
saleswomen
were
slyly
grinning
at
this
family
explanation
she
resumed
severely
now
mademoiselle
vadon
do
let
us
go
to
sleep
twenty
cloaks
cashmere
extra
fourth
size
at
eighteen
francs
and
a
half
resumed
marguerite
in
her
voice
lhomme
with
his
head
bowed
down
again
began
writing
they
had
gradually
raised
his
salary
to
nine
thousand
francs
a
year
but
he
was
very
humble
before
madame
aurélie
who
still
brought
nearly
three
times
as
much
into
the
family
for
a
while
the
work
was
pushed
forward
figures
were
bandied
about
garments
rained
thick
and
fast
on
the
tables
but
clara
had
invented
another
amusement
she
was
teasing
the
messenger
joseph
about
a
passion
which
he
was
said
to
nourish
for
a
young
lady
in
the
this
young
lady
already
years
old
and
thin
and
pale
was
a
of
madame
desforges
who
had
wanted
mouret
to
engage
her
as
a
saleswoman
backing
up
her
recommendation
with
a
touching
story
an
orphan
the
last
of
the
fontenailles
an
old
and
noble
family
of
poitou
had
been
thrown
on
to
the
streets
of
paris
with
a
drunken
father
still
she
had
remained
virtuous
amidst
this
misfortune
which
was
the
greater
as
her
education
was
altogether
too
limited
to
enable
her
to
secure
employment
as
governess
or
mouret
generally
got
angry
when
any
one
recommended
these
gentlewomen
to
him
there
were
no
more
incapable
more
insupportable
more
creatures
than
these
gentlewomen
said
he
and
besides
a
saleswoman
could
not
be
improvised
she
must
serve
an
apprenticeship
it
was
an
intricate
and
delicate
business
however
he
took
madame
desforges
placing
her
in
the
in
the
same
way
as
to
oblige
friends
he
had
already
found
places
for
two
countesses
and
a
baroness
in
the
advertising
department
where
they
addressed
wrappers
and
envelopes
mademoiselle
de
fontenailles
earned
three
francs
a
day
which
just
enabled
her
to
live
in
her
modest
room
in
the
rue
it
was
on
seeing
her
with
her
sad
look
and
shabby
attire
that
joseph
heart
very
tender
despite
his
rough
soldierly
manner
had
been
touched
he
did
not
confess
but
blushed
when
the
young
ladies
of
the
mantle
department
chaffed
him
for
the
was
not
far
off
and
they
had
often
observed
him
prowling
about
the
doorway
joseph
is
somewhat
murmured
clara
his
nose
is
always
turning
towards
the
department
they
had
requisitioned
mademoiselle
de
fontenailles
there
and
she
was
assisting
at
the
trousseau
counter
as
the
messenger
continually
glanced
in
that
direction
the
saleswomen
began
to
laugh
whereupon
he
became
very
confused
and
plunged
into
his
accounts
whilst
marguerite
in
order
to
arrest
the
burst
of
gaiety
which
was
tickling
her
throat
cried
out
louder
still
fourteen
jackets
english
cloth
second
size
at
fifteen
francs
at
this
madame
aurélie
who
was
calling
out
some
cloaks
could
not
make
herself
heard
she
interfered
with
a
wounded
air
and
a
majestic
slowness
of
manner
a
little
softer
mademoiselle
we
are
not
in
a
market
and
you
are
all
of
you
very
unreasonable
to
be
amusing
yourselves
with
such
childish
matters
when
our
time
is
so
precious
just
at
that
moment
as
clara
was
not
paying
any
attention
to
the
packages
a
catastrophe
took
place
several
mantles
tumbled
down
and
all
the
heaps
on
the
tables
carried
with
them
toppled
over
one
after
the
other
so
that
the
carpet
was
quite
strewn
with
them
there
what
did
i
say
cried
the
beside
herself
pray
be
more
careful
mademoiselle
prunaire
it
altogether
intolerable
but
a
hum
ran
along
mouret
and
bourdoncle
making
their
round
of
inspection
had
just
appeared
the
voices
began
calling
again
and
the
pens
sputtered
whilst
clara
hastened
to
pick
up
the
garments
the
governor
did
not
interrupt
the
work
he
stood
there
for
several
minutes
mute
and
smiling
with
the
gay
victorious
face
of
days
and
it
was
only
on
his
lips
that
a
slight
feverish
quiver
could
be
detected
when
he
perceived
denise
he
nearly
gave
way
to
a
gesture
of
astonishment
she
had
come
down
then
his
eyes
met
madame
aurélie
then
after
a
moment
hesitation
he
went
away
into
the
department
however
denise
warned
by
the
slight
noise
had
raised
her
head
and
having
recognised
mouret
she
had
immediately
bent
over
her
work
again
since
she
had
been
writing
in
this
mechanical
way
amidst
the
of
the
goods
a
peaceful
feeling
had
stolen
over
her
she
had
always
yielded
thus
to
the
first
outburst
of
her
sensitiveness
tears
suffocated
her
and
passion
increased
her
torments
but
then
she
regained
her
a
grand
calm
courage
a
quiet
but
inexorable
strength
of
will
and
now
with
her
limpid
eyes
and
pale
complexion
she
was
free
from
all
agitation
entirely
absorbed
in
her
work
resolved
to
silence
her
heart
and
to
do
nothing
but
her
will
ten
struck
the
uproar
of
the
was
increasing
and
amidst
the
incessant
shouts
which
rose
and
flew
about
on
all
sides
the
same
news
circulated
with
surprising
rapidity
every
salesman
knew
that
mouret
had
written
that
morning
inviting
denise
to
dinner
the
indiscretion
came
from
pauline
on
going
downstairs
still
greatly
excited
she
had
met
deloche
in
the
lace
department
and
without
noticing
that
liénard
was
talking
to
the
young
man
had
immediately
relieved
her
mind
of
the
secret
it
all
over
my
dear
fellow
just
received
a
letter
he
has
invited
her
to
dinner
for
this
evening
deloche
turned
very
pale
he
had
understood
for
he
often
questioned
pauline
each
day
they
spoke
of
their
common
friend
and
passion
for
her
moreover
she
frequently
scolded
him
for
his
secret
love
for
denise
with
whom
he
would
never
succeed
and
shrugged
her
shoulders
when
he
expressed
his
approval
of
the
girl
conduct
with
reference
to
their
employer
her
foot
better
she
coming
down
continued
pauline
pray
put
on
that
funeral
face
there
no
reason
to
cry
and
thereupon
she
hastened
back
to
her
department
ah
good
murmured
liénard
who
had
heard
everything
you
talking
about
the
young
girl
with
the
sprain
you
were
quite
right
to
make
haste
in
defending
her
last
night
at
the
café
then
he
also
ran
off
but
before
he
had
returned
to
the
woollen
department
he
had
already
related
the
story
to
four
or
five
fellows
in
less
than
ten
minutes
it
had
gone
the
round
of
the
whole
shop
liénard
last
remark
to
deloche
referred
to
a
scene
which
had
occurred
on
the
previous
evening
at
the
café
deloche
and
he
were
now
constantly
together
the
former
had
taken
hutin
room
at
the
hôtel
de
smyrne
when
that
gentleman
on
being
appointed
had
hired
a
suite
of
three
rooms
and
the
two
salesmen
came
to
the
paradise
together
in
the
morning
and
waited
for
each
other
in
the
evening
in
order
to
go
away
together
their
rooms
which
adjoined
one
another
overlooked
a
black
yard
a
narrow
well
the
stench
from
which
pervaded
the
hotel
they
got
on
very
well
together
notwithstanding
their
difference
of
character
the
one
carelessly
squandering
the
money
which
he
drew
from
his
father
and
the
other
penniless
perpetually
tormented
by
ideas
of
thrift
both
having
however
one
point
in
common
their
unskilfulness
as
salesmen
which
kept
them
vegetating
at
their
counters
without
any
increase
of
salary
after
leaving
the
shop
they
spent
the
greater
part
of
their
time
at
the
café
void
of
customers
during
the
day
this
café
filled
at
about
eight
with
an
overflowing
crowd
of
employees
the
stream
of
shopmen
which
rolled
into
the
street
from
the
great
doorway
in
the
place
gaillon
then
a
deafening
uproar
of
dominoes
laughter
and
yelping
voices
burst
forth
amidst
dense
tobacco
smoke
beer
and
coffee
were
in
great
demand
seated
in
the
corner
liénard
would
order
the
most
expensive
beverages
whilst
deloche
contented
himself
with
a
glass
of
beer
which
he
would
take
four
hours
to
drink
it
was
here
that
the
latter
had
heard
favier
relating
at
a
neighbouring
table
some
abominable
things
about
the
way
in
which
denise
had
hooked
the
governor
he
had
with
difficulty
restrained
himself
from
striking
him
however
as
the
other
went
on
adding
still
viler
and
viler
stories
of
the
girl
he
had
at
last
called
him
a
liar
feeling
mad
with
rage
what
a
blackguard
he
had
shouted
it
a
lie
it
a
lie
i
tell
you
and
in
the
emotion
agitating
him
he
had
added
a
confession
entirely
opening
his
heart
in
a
stammering
voice
i
know
her
and
it
is
true
she
has
never
had
any
affection
except
for
one
man
yes
for
monsieur
hutin
and
even
he
has
never
noticed
it
the
report
of
this
quarrel
exaggerated
and
distorted
was
already
affording
amusement
to
the
whole
shop
when
the
story
of
mouret
letter
ran
round
in
fact
it
was
to
a
salesman
in
the
silk
department
that
liénard
first
confided
the
news
with
the
the
was
going
on
rapidly
favier
and
two
shopmen
mounted
on
stools
were
emptying
the
shelves
and
passing
the
pieces
of
stuff
to
hutin
who
standing
on
a
table
called
out
the
figures
after
consulting
the
tickets
and
he
then
dropped
the
pieces
on
to
the
floor
over
which
they
spread
rising
slowly
like
an
autumn
tide
other
employees
were
writing
albert
lhomme
being
among
the
helpers
his
face
pale
and
heavy
after
a
night
spent
in
a
low
show
at
la
chapelle
a
sheet
of
light
fell
from
the
glazed
roof
of
the
hall
through
which
could
be
seen
the
intense
blue
of
the
sky
draw
those
blinds
cried
out
bouthemont
who
was
very
busy
superintending
the
work
that
sun
is
unbearable
favier
on
tiptoe
trying
to
reach
a
piece
of
silk
then
grumbled
under
his
breath
a
nice
thing
to
shut
people
up
on
a
lovely
day
like
this
no
fear
of
it
raining
on
day
and
they
keep
us
under
lock
and
key
like
convicts
when
all
paris
is
out
of
doors
he
passed
the
silk
to
hutin
on
the
ticket
was
the
measurement
diminished
at
each
sale
by
the
quantity
sold
which
greatly
simplified
the
work
the
cried
out
fancy
silk
small
check
yards
at
six
francs
and
a
half
and
then
the
piece
went
to
increase
the
heap
already
on
the
floor
whilst
waiting
for
another
he
resumed
a
conversation
previously
begun
by
saying
to
favier
so
he
wanted
to
fight
you
yes
i
was
quietly
drinking
my
glass
of
beer
it
was
hardly
worth
his
while
to
contradict
me
for
she
has
just
received
a
letter
from
the
governor
inviting
her
to
dinner
the
whole
shop
is
talking
about
it
what
had
she
dined
with
him
before
favier
handed
him
another
piece
of
silk
no
it
seems
not
though
my
opinion
was
all
the
other
way
the
whole
department
was
now
joking
about
the
affair
without
however
allowing
the
work
to
suffer
the
young
girl
name
passed
from
mouth
to
mouth
and
the
salesmen
arched
their
backs
and
winked
bouthemont
himself
who
took
a
rare
delight
in
all
such
stories
could
not
help
adding
his
joke
just
then
however
mignot
came
down
with
the
twenty
francs
which
he
had
just
borrowed
and
he
stopped
to
slip
ten
francs
into
albert
hand
making
an
appointment
with
him
for
the
evening
a
projected
spree
hampered
by
lack
of
money
but
still
possible
notwithstanding
the
smallness
of
the
sum
secured
however
when
mignot
heard
about
the
famous
letter
he
made
such
an
abominable
remark
that
bouthemont
was
obliged
to
interfere
that
enough
gentlemen
it
is
any
of
our
business
go
on
monsieur
hutin
fancy
silk
small
check
yards
at
six
francs
and
a
half
cried
out
the
latter
the
pens
started
off
again
the
pieces
fell
the
flood
of
material
still
increased
as
if
the
water
of
a
river
had
emptied
itself
there
and
there
was
no
end
to
the
calling
out
of
the
fancy
silks
favier
in
an
undertone
thereupon
remarked
that
the
stock
in
hand
would
form
a
nice
total
the
governors
would
be
enchanted
that
big
fool
of
a
bouthemont
might
be
the
best
buyer
in
paris
but
as
a
salesman
he
was
not
worth
his
salt
hutin
smiled
delighted
and
giving
the
other
a
friendly
look
of
approval
for
after
having
himself
introduced
bouthemont
to
the
ladies
paradise
in
order
to
get
rid
of
robineau
he
was
now
undermining
him
also
with
the
firm
intention
of
depriving
him
of
his
berth
it
was
the
same
war
as
formerly
treacherous
insinuations
whispered
in
the
partners
ears
excessive
zeal
to
push
one
self
forward
a
regular
campaign
carried
on
with
affable
cunning
hutin
was
again
displaying
some
condescension
towards
favier
but
the
latter
thin
and
frigid
with
a
bilious
look
gave
him
a
sly
glance
as
if
to
count
how
many
mouthfuls
this
short
little
fellow
would
make
and
to
imply
that
he
was
waiting
till
he
had
swallowed
up
bouthemont
in
order
to
eat
him
afterwards
he
favier
hoped
to
get
the
place
should
his
friend
be
appointed
manager
and
after
that
they
would
see
consumed
by
the
fever
which
was
raging
from
one
to
the
other
end
of
the
shop
both
of
them
began
talking
of
the
probable
increases
of
salary
without
however
ceasing
to
call
out
the
stock
of
fancy
silks
they
felt
sure
that
bouthemont
would
secure
thirty
thousand
francs
that
year
hutin
for
his
part
would
exceed
ten
thousand
whilst
favier
estimated
his
pay
and
commission
at
five
thousand
five
hundred
the
amount
of
business
in
the
department
was
increasing
yearly
the
salesmen
secured
promotion
and
increase
of
pay
like
officers
in
time
of
war
wo
those
fancy
silks
soon
be
finished
asked
bouthemont
suddenly
with
an
expression
of
annoyance
but
it
was
a
miserable
spring
always
raining
people
bought
nothing
but
black
silks
his
fat
jovial
face
became
cloudy
as
he
gazed
at
the
growing
heap
on
the
floor
whilst
hutin
called
out
louder
still
in
a
sonorous
voice
tinged
with
an
accent
of
triumph
fancy
silks
small
check
yards
at
six
francs
and
a
half
there
was
still
another
favier
whose
arms
were
getting
tired
was
now
progressing
but
slowly
as
he
handed
hutin
the
last
pieces
he
resumed
in
a
low
tone
oh
i
say
i
forgot
have
you
heard
that
the
in
the
mantle
department
once
had
a
regular
fancy
for
you
hutin
seemed
greatly
surprised
what
how
do
you
mean
yes
that
great
booby
deloche
let
it
out
to
us
but
i
remember
her
casting
sheep
eyes
at
you
some
time
back
since
his
appointment
as
hutin
had
thrown
up
his
singers
flattered
at
heart
by
favier
words
he
nevertheless
replied
with
a
scornful
air
i
do
care
for
such
scraggy
creatures
and
then
he
called
out
white
poult
yards
at
eight
francs
oh
at
last
murmured
bouthemont
greatly
relieved
but
a
bell
rang
that
for
the
second
table
to
which
favier
belonged
he
jumped
off
the
stool
where
another
salesman
took
his
place
and
he
was
obliged
to
climb
over
the
mountain
of
materials
with
which
the
floor
was
littered
similar
heaps
were
scattered
about
in
every
department
the
shelves
the
boxes
the
cupboards
were
being
gradually
emptied
whilst
the
goods
overflowed
on
all
sides
between
the
counters
and
the
tables
in
ever
rising
piles
in
the
linen
department
you
heard
heavy
bales
of
calico
falling
in
the
mercery
department
there
was
a
clicking
of
boxes
whilst
distant
rumbling
sounds
came
from
amongst
the
furniture
every
sort
of
voice
was
heard
too
shrill
full
deep
and
husky
figures
whizzed
through
the
air
and
a
rustling
clamour
reigned
in
the
immense
nave
the
clamour
of
forests
in
january
when
the
wind
whistles
through
the
branches
favier
at
last
got
clear
and
went
up
the
staircase
since
the
enlargement
of
the
ladies
paradise
the
refectories
had
been
shifted
to
the
fourth
storey
of
the
new
buildings
as
he
hurried
up
he
overtook
deloche
and
liénard
who
had
gone
on
before
him
so
he
fell
back
on
mignot
who
was
following
at
his
heels
the
deuce
said
he
in
the
corridor
leading
to
the
kitchen
on
reaching
the
on
which
the
bill
of
fare
was
inscribed
you
can
see
it
day
a
regular
feast
chicken
or
leg
of
mutton
and
artichokes
their
mutton
wo
be
much
of
a
success
mignot
sniggered
murmuring
is
there
a
poultry
epidemic
on
then
however
deloche
and
liénard
had
taken
their
portions
and
gone
away
favier
thereupon
leant
over
the
wicket
and
called
out
chicken
but
he
had
to
wait
one
of
the
kitchen
helps
had
cut
his
finger
in
carving
and
this
caused
some
confusion
favier
stood
there
with
his
face
to
the
opening
gazing
into
the
kitchen
with
its
giant
appliances
there
was
a
central
range
over
which
by
a
system
of
chains
and
pullies
a
couple
of
rails
fixed
to
the
ceiling
brought
colossal
cauldrons
which
four
men
could
not
have
lifted
several
cooks
quite
white
in
the
ruddy
glow
of
the
were
attending
to
the
evening
soup
mounted
on
metal
ladders
and
armed
with
skimmers
fixed
to
long
handles
then
against
the
wall
were
grills
large
enough
for
the
roasting
of
martyrs
saucepans
big
enough
for
the
stewing
of
entire
sheep
a
monumental
and
a
marble
basin
filled
by
a
continual
stream
of
water
to
the
left
could
be
seen
a
scullery
with
stone
sinks
as
large
as
ponds
whilst
on
the
other
side
to
the
right
was
a
huge
where
a
glimpse
was
caught
of
numerous
joints
of
red
meat
hanging
from
steel
hooks
a
machine
for
peeling
potatoes
was
working
with
the
of
a
mill
and
two
small
trucks
laden
with
salad
were
being
wheeled
by
some
kitchen
helps
into
a
cool
spot
under
a
gigantic
filter
chicken
repeated
favier
getting
impatient
then
turning
round
he
added
in
a
lower
tone
one
fellow
has
cut
himself
it
disgusting
his
blood
running
over
the
food
mignot
wanted
to
see
quite
a
string
of
shopmen
had
now
arrived
there
was
a
deal
of
laughing
and
pushing
the
two
young
men
their
heads
at
the
wicket
exchanged
remarks
about
this
phalansterian
kitchen
in
which
the
least
important
utensils
even
the
spits
and
larding
pins
assumed
gigantic
proportions
two
thousand
luncheons
and
two
thousand
dinners
had
to
be
served
and
the
number
of
employees
was
increasing
every
week
it
was
quite
an
abyss
into
which
something
like
bushels
of
potatoes
one
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
of
butter
and
sixteen
hundred
pounds
of
meat
were
cast
every
day
and
at
each
meal
they
had
to
broach
three
casks
of
wine
over
a
hundred
and
fifty
gallons
being
served
out
at
the
wine
counter
ah
at
last
murmured
favier
when
the
cook
reappeared
with
a
large
pan
out
of
which
he
handed
him
the
leg
of
a
fowl
chicken
said
mignot
behind
him
and
with
their
plates
in
their
hands
they
both
entered
the
refectory
after
taking
their
wine
at
the
bar
whilst
behind
them
the
word
chicken
was
repeated
without
cessation
and
one
could
hear
the
cook
picking
up
the
portions
with
his
fork
with
a
rapid
rhythmical
sound
the
men
was
now
an
immense
apartment
supplying
ample
room
for
five
hundred
people
at
each
repast
the
places
were
laid
at
long
mahogany
tables
placed
parallel
across
the
room
and
at
either
end
were
similar
tables
reserved
for
the
managers
of
departments
and
the
inspectors
whilst
in
the
centre
was
a
counter
for
the
extras
right
and
left
large
windows
admitted
a
white
light
to
the
gallery
whose
ceiling
although
over
twelve
feet
from
the
floor
seemed
very
low
owing
to
the
development
of
the
other
proportions
the
sole
ornaments
on
the
walls
painted
a
light
yellow
were
the
napkin
cupboards
beyond
this
first
refectory
came
that
of
the
messengers
and
carmen
where
the
meals
were
served
irregularly
according
to
the
needs
of
the
moment
what
you
got
a
leg
as
well
mignot
said
favier
as
he
took
his
place
at
one
of
the
tables
opposite
his
companion
other
young
men
now
sat
down
around
them
there
was
no
tablecloth
the
plates
clattered
on
the
bare
mahogany
and
in
this
particular
corner
everybody
was
raising
exclamations
for
the
number
of
legs
distributed
was
really
prodigious
these
chickens
are
all
legs
remarked
mignot
yes
they
real
centipedes
retorted
another
salesman
those
who
had
merely
secured
pieces
of
carcase
were
greatly
discontented
however
the
food
had
been
of
much
better
quality
since
the
late
improvements
mouret
no
longer
treated
with
a
contractor
at
a
fixed
rate
he
had
taken
the
kitchen
into
his
own
hands
organizing
it
like
one
of
the
departments
with
a
and
an
inspector
and
if
he
spent
more
money
he
got
on
the
other
hand
more
work
out
of
the
staff
a
practical
humanitarian
calculation
which
had
long
terrified
bourdoncle
mine
is
pretty
tender
all
the
same
said
mignot
pass
the
bread
the
big
loaf
was
sent
round
and
after
cutting
a
slice
for
himself
he
dug
the
knife
into
the
crust
a
few
dilatory
ones
now
hurried
in
taking
their
places
a
ferocious
appetite
increased
by
the
work
burst
forth
from
one
to
the
other
end
of
the
immense
tables
there
was
an
increasing
clatter
of
forks
a
gurgling
sound
of
bottles
being
emptied
a
noise
of
glasses
laid
down
too
violently
amidst
the
grinding
rumble
of
five
hundred
pairs
of
powerful
jaws
chewing
with
wondrous
energy
and
the
talk
still
infrequent
seemed
to
be
hampered
by
the
fullness
of
the
mouths
deloche
however
seated
between
baugé
and
liénard
found
himself
nearly
opposite
favier
they
had
glanced
at
each
other
with
a
rancorous
look
some
neighbours
aware
of
their
quarrel
on
the
previous
day
began
whispering
together
then
there
was
a
laugh
at
poor
although
always
famished
he
invariably
fell
on
the
worst
piece
at
table
by
a
sort
of
cruel
fatality
this
time
he
had
come
in
for
the
neck
of
a
chicken
and
some
bits
of
carcase
without
saying
a
word
however
he
let
them
joke
away
swallowing
large
mouthfuls
of
bread
and
picking
the
neck
with
the
infinite
art
of
a
fellow
who
entertains
great
respect
for
meat
why
do
you
complain
asked
baugé
but
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
what
would
be
the
use
of
that
it
was
always
the
same
when
he
did
venture
to
complain
things
went
worse
than
ever
you
know
the
bobbinards
have
got
their
club
now
said
mignot
all
at
once
yes
my
boy
the
club
it
held
at
a
wine
shop
in
the
rue
where
they
hire
a
room
on
saturdays
he
was
speaking
of
the
mercery
salesmen
the
whole
table
began
to
joke
between
two
mouthfuls
with
his
voice
still
thick
each
made
some
remark
adding
a
detail
and
only
the
obstinate
readers
remained
mute
with
their
noses
buried
in
their
newspapers
it
could
not
be
denied
that
shopmen
were
gradually
assuming
a
better
style
nearly
half
of
them
now
spoke
english
or
german
it
was
no
longer
considered
good
form
to
go
and
kick
up
a
row
at
bullier
or
prowl
about
the
for
the
pleasure
of
hissing
ugly
singers
no
a
score
of
them
got
together
and
formed
a
club
have
they
a
piano
like
the
asked
liénard
i
should
rather
think
they
had
exclaimed
mignot
and
they
play
my
boy
and
sing
there
even
one
of
them
little
bavoux
who
recites
verses
the
gaiety
redoubled
and
they
chaffed
little
bavoux
nevertheless
beneath
their
laughter
lay
a
great
respect
then
they
spoke
of
a
piece
at
the
vaudeville
in
which
a
played
a
nasty
part
which
annoyed
several
of
them
whilst
others
began
anxiously
wondering
at
what
time
they
would
get
away
that
evening
having
invitations
to
pass
the
evening
at
friends
houses
and
from
all
points
came
similar
conversations
amidst
an
increasing
rattle
of
crockery
to
drive
away
the
odour
of
the
food
the
warm
steam
which
rose
from
the
five
hundred
plates
they
had
opened
the
windows
whose
lowered
blinds
were
scorching
in
the
heavy
august
sun
burning
gusts
came
in
from
the
street
golden
reflections
yellowed
the
ceiling
steeping
the
perspiring
eaters
in
a
reddish
light
a
nice
thing
to
shut
people
up
on
such
a
fine
sunday
as
this
repeated
favier
this
remark
brought
them
back
to
the
it
had
been
a
splendid
year
and
they
went
on
to
speak
of
the
salaries
the
rises
the
eternal
subject
the
stirring
question
which
occupied
them
all
it
was
always
thus
on
chicken
days
a
wonderful
excitement
declared
itself
the
noise
at
last
became
unbearable
when
the
waiters
brought
the
artichokes
you
could
not
hear
yourself
speak
however
the
inspector
on
duty
had
orders
to
be
indulgent
by
the
way
cried
favier
you
heard
the
news
but
his
voice
was
drowned
by
mignot
asking
who
does
like
artichoke
i
sell
my
dessert
for
an
artichoke
no
one
replied
everybody
liked
artichoke
that
lunch
would
be
counted
amongst
the
good
ones
for
peaches
were
to
be
given
for
dessert
he
has
invited
her
to
dinner
my
dear
fellow
said
favier
to
his
neighbour
finishing
his
story
what
you
did
know
it
the
whole
table
knew
it
they
were
tired
of
talking
about
it
since
early
morning
and
the
same
poor
jokes
passed
from
mouth
to
mouth
deloche
was
quivering
again
and
his
eyes
at
last
rested
on
favier
who
was
persisting
in
his
shameful
remarks
but
all
at
once
the
silk
salesman
ducked
his
head
for
deloche
yielding
to
an
irresistible
impulse
had
thrown
his
last
glass
of
wine
into
his
face
stammering
take
that
you
infernal
liar
i
ought
to
have
drenched
you
yesterday
this
caused
quite
a
scandal
a
few
drops
had
spurted
on
neighbours
whilst
he
himself
only
had
his
hair
slightly
wetted
the
wine
thrown
by
an
awkward
hand
had
fallen
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
however
the
others
got
angry
asking
deloche
if
the
girl
was
his
property
that
he
defended
her
in
this
way
what
a
brute
he
was
he
deserved
a
good
drubbing
to
teach
him
better
manners
however
their
voices
fell
for
an
inspector
was
observed
coming
along
and
it
was
useless
to
let
the
management
interfere
in
the
quarrel
favier
contented
himself
with
saying
if
it
had
caught
me
you
would
have
seen
some
sport
then
the
affair
wound
up
in
jeers
when
deloche
still
trembling
wished
to
drink
by
way
of
hiding
his
confusion
and
mechanically
caught
hold
of
his
empty
glass
they
all
burst
out
laughing
he
laid
his
glass
down
again
awkwardly
enough
and
commenced
sucking
the
leaves
of
the
artichoke
which
he
had
already
eaten
pass
deloche
the
water
bottle
said
mignot
quietly
he
thirsty
the
laughter
increased
the
young
men
took
clean
plates
from
the
piles
standing
at
equal
distances
on
the
table
whilst
the
waiters
handed
round
the
dessert
which
consisted
of
peaches
in
baskets
and
they
all
held
their
sides
when
mignot
added
with
a
grin
each
man
to
his
taste
deloche
takes
wine
with
his
peaches
deloche
however
sat
motionless
with
his
head
hanging
down
as
if
deaf
to
the
joking
going
on
around
him
he
was
full
of
despairing
regret
at
thought
of
what
he
had
just
done
those
fellows
were
right
what
right
had
he
to
defend
her
they
would
now
think
all
sorts
of
villainous
things
he
could
have
killed
himself
for
having
thus
compromised
her
in
attempting
to
prove
her
innocence
such
was
always
his
luck
he
might
just
as
well
kill
himself
at
once
for
he
could
not
even
yield
to
the
promptings
of
his
heart
without
doing
some
stupid
thing
and
then
tears
came
into
his
eyes
was
it
not
also
his
fault
if
the
whole
shop
was
talking
of
the
letter
written
by
the
governor
he
heard
them
grinning
and
making
abominable
remarks
about
this
invitation
which
liénard
alone
had
been
informed
of
and
he
reproached
himself
he
ought
never
to
have
let
pauline
speak
before
that
fellow
he
was
really
responsible
for
the
annoying
indiscretion
which
had
been
committed
why
did
you
go
and
relate
that
he
murmured
at
last
in
a
sorrowful
voice
it
very
wrong
i
replied
liénard
but
i
only
told
it
to
one
or
two
persons
enjoining
secrecy
one
never
knows
how
these
things
get
about
when
deloche
made
up
his
mind
to
drink
a
glass
of
water
everybody
burst
out
laughing
again
they
had
finished
their
meal
and
were
lolling
back
on
their
chairs
waiting
for
the
bell
to
recall
them
to
work
they
had
not
asked
for
many
extras
at
the
great
central
counter
especially
as
on
day
the
firm
treated
them
to
coffee
the
cups
were
steaming
perspiring
faces
shone
under
the
light
vapour
floating
like
bluey
clouds
from
cigarettes
at
the
windows
the
blinds
hung
motionless
without
the
slightest
flapping
one
of
them
on
being
drawn
up
admitted
a
ray
of
sunshine
which
sped
across
the
room
and
gilded
the
ceiling
the
uproar
of
the
voices
beat
upon
the
walls
with
such
force
that
the
bell
was
at
first
only
heard
by
those
at
the
tables
near
the
door
then
they
got
up
and
for
some
time
the
corridors
were
full
of
the
confusion
of
the
departure
deloche
however
remained
behind
to
escape
the
malicious
remarks
that
were
still
being
made
baugé
even
went
out
before
him
and
baugé
was
as
a
rule
the
last
to
leave
taking
a
circuitous
route
so
as
to
meet
pauline
on
he
way
to
the
ladies
a
manœuvre
they
had
arranged
between
them
the
only
chance
they
had
of
seeing
one
another
for
a
minute
during
business
hours
that
day
however
just
as
they
were
indulging
in
a
loving
kiss
in
a
corner
of
the
passage
they
were
surprised
by
denise
who
was
also
going
up
to
lunch
she
was
walking
slowly
on
account
of
her
foot
oh
my
dear
stammered
pauline
very
red
do
say
anything
will
you
baugé
with
his
big
limbs
and
giant
stature
was
trembling
like
a
little
boy
he
muttered
they
precious
soon
pitch
us
out
although
our
marriage
may
be
announced
they
do
allow
any
kissing
the
brutes
denise
greatly
agitated
affected
not
to
have
seen
them
and
baugé
disappeared
just
as
deloche
also
going
the
longest
way
round
in
his
turn
appeared
he
wished
to
apologize
stammering
out
phrases
that
denise
did
not
at
first
catch
then
as
he
blamed
pauline
for
having
spoken
before
liénard
and
she
stood
there
looking
very
embarrassed
denise
at
last
understood
the
meaning
of
the
whispers
she
had
heard
around
her
all
the
morning
it
was
the
story
of
the
letter
circulating
and
again
was
she
shaken
by
the
shiver
with
which
this
letter
had
agitated
her
but
i
did
know
repeated
pauline
besides
there
nothing
bad
in
the
letter
let
them
gossip
they
jealous
of
course
my
dear
said
denise
at
last
with
her
sensible
air
i
do
blame
you
in
any
way
you
spoken
nothing
but
the
truth
i
received
a
letter
and
it
is
my
duty
to
answer
it
deloche
went
off
in
the
belief
that
the
girl
accepted
the
situation
and
would
keep
the
appointment
that
evening
when
the
two
saleswomen
had
lunched
in
a
small
room
adjoining
the
larger
one
where
the
women
were
served
much
more
comfortably
pauline
had
to
assist
denise
downstairs
again
as
her
sprain
was
getting
more
painful
in
the
afternoon
warmth
below
the
was
roaring
more
loudly
than
ever
the
moment
for
the
supreme
effort
had
arrived
when
as
the
work
had
not
made
much
progress
during
the
morning
everybody
put
forth
their
strength
in
order
that
all
might
be
finished
that
night
the
voices
grew
louder
still
you
saw
nothing
but
waving
arms
continually
emptying
the
shelves
and
throwing
the
goods
down
and
it
was
impossible
to
get
along
for
the
tide
of
the
bales
and
packages
on
the
floor
rose
as
high
as
the
counters
a
sea
of
heads
brandished
fists
and
flying
limbs
seemed
to
extend
to
the
very
depths
of
the
departments
with
the
confused
aspect
of
a
distant
riot
it
was
the
last
fever
of
the
clearing
the
machine
seemed
ready
to
burst
and
past
the
windows
all
round
the
closed
shop
there
still
went
a
few
pedestrians
pale
with
the
stifling
boredom
of
a
summer
sunday
on
the
pavement
in
the
rue
three
tall
girls
bareheaded
and
were
impudently
pressing
their
faces
against
the
windows
trying
to
see
the
curious
work
going
on
inside
when
denise
returned
to
the
mantle
department
madame
aurélie
told
marguerite
to
finish
calling
out
the
garments
there
was
still
the
checking
to
be
done
and
for
this
being
desirous
of
silence
she
retired
into
the
taking
denise
with
her
come
with
me
we
do
the
checking
she
said
and
then
you
can
add
up
the
figures
however
as
she
wished
to
leave
the
door
open
in
order
to
keep
an
eye
on
her
young
ladies
the
noise
came
in
and
they
could
not
hear
themselves
much
better
even
in
this
a
large
square
apartment
furnished
merely
with
some
chairs
and
three
long
tables
in
one
corner
were
the
great
machine
knives
for
cutting
up
the
patterns
entire
pieces
of
stuff
were
consumed
every
year
they
sent
away
more
than
sixty
thousand
francs
worth
of
material
cut
up
in
strips
from
morning
to
night
the
knives
were
cutting
silk
wool
and
linen
with
a
noise
then
too
the
books
had
to
be
got
together
gummed
or
sewn
and
between
the
two
windows
there
was
also
a
little
for
the
tickets
not
so
loud
please
cried
madame
aurélie
every
now
and
again
quite
unable
as
she
was
to
hear
denise
reading
out
the
articles
then
the
checking
of
the
first
lists
being
completed
she
left
the
young
girl
at
one
of
the
tables
absorbed
in
the
but
came
back
almost
immediately
and
placed
mademoiselle
de
fontenailles
near
her
the
department
not
requiring
madame
any
longer
had
placed
her
at
her
disposal
she
could
also
do
some
it
would
save
time
but
the
appearance
of
the
marchioness
as
clara
called
the
poor
creature
had
disturbed
the
department
they
laughed
and
joked
at
poor
joseph
and
their
ferocious
sallies
were
wafted
into
the
do
draw
back
you
are
not
at
all
in
my
way
said
denise
seized
with
pity
my
inkstand
will
suffice
we
dip
together
mademoiselle
de
fontenailles
brutified
by
her
unfortunate
position
could
not
even
find
a
word
of
gratitude
she
looked
like
a
woman
who
drank
her
meagre
face
had
a
livid
hue
and
her
hands
alone
white
and
delicate
attested
the
distinction
of
her
birth
however
the
laughter
all
at
once
ceased
and
the
work
resumed
its
regular
roar
mouret
was
once
more
going
through
the
departments
but
he
stopped
and
looked
round
for
denise
surprised
at
not
seeing
her
there
then
he
made
a
sign
to
madame
aurélie
and
both
drew
aside
and
for
a
moment
talked
in
a
low
tone
he
must
have
been
questioning
her
she
nodded
towards
the
and
then
seemed
to
be
making
a
report
no
doubt
she
was
relating
that
the
young
girl
had
been
weeping
that
morning
very
good
said
mouret
aloud
coming
nearer
show
me
the
lists
this
way
sir
said
the
we
have
run
away
from
the
noise
he
followed
her
into
the
next
room
clara
was
not
duped
by
this
manœuvre
but
marguerite
threw
her
the
garments
at
a
quicker
rate
in
order
to
take
up
her
attention
and
close
her
mouth
was
the
a
good
comrade
her
affairs
did
not
concern
them
the
whole
department
was
now
aiding
and
abetting
the
intrigue
the
young
ladies
grew
more
agitated
than
ever
lhomme
and
joseph
affected
not
to
see
or
hear
anything
and
inspector
jouve
who
in
passing
by
had
remarked
madame
aurélie
tactics
began
walking
up
and
down
before
the
door
with
the
regular
step
of
a
sentry
guarding
the
will
and
pleasure
of
a
superior
give
monsieur
mouret
the
lists
said
the
denise
handed
them
over
and
sat
there
with
her
eyes
raised
she
had
started
slightly
but
had
promptly
conquered
herself
and
retained
a
fine
calm
look
although
her
cheeks
were
pale
for
a
moment
mouret
appeared
to
be
absorbed
in
the
lists
of
articles
never
giving
the
girl
a
glance
a
silence
reigned
then
madame
aurélie
all
at
once
stepped
up
to
mademoiselle
de
fontenailles
who
had
not
even
turned
her
head
and
apparently
dissatisfied
with
her
counting
said
to
her
in
an
undertone
go
and
help
with
the
parcels
you
are
not
used
to
figures
mademoiselle
de
fontenailles
got
up
and
returned
to
the
department
where
she
was
greeted
with
whispering
joseph
under
the
laughing
eyes
of
these
young
minxes
was
writing
anyhow
clara
though
delighted
to
have
an
assistant
nevertheless
treated
her
very
roughly
hating
her
as
she
hated
all
the
women
in
the
shop
what
an
idiotic
thing
to
yield
to
the
love
of
a
workman
when
you
were
a
marchioness
and
yet
she
envied
the
poor
creature
this
love
very
good
repeated
mouret
still
pretending
to
read
however
madame
aurélie
hardly
knew
how
to
get
away
in
her
turn
in
a
decent
fashion
she
turned
about
went
to
look
at
the
machine
knives
furious
with
her
husband
for
not
inventing
a
pretext
for
calling
her
but
then
he
was
never
of
any
use
in
serious
matters
he
would
have
died
of
thirst
close
to
a
pond
it
was
marguerite
who
proved
intelligent
enough
to
go
and
ask
the
a
question
i
coming
replied
the
latter
and
her
dignity
now
being
saved
having
a
pretext
to
join
the
young
ladies
who
were
watching
her
she
at
last
left
denise
and
mouret
alone
together
coming
out
of
the
with
a
majestic
step
and
so
noble
an
air
that
the
saleswomen
did
not
even
dare
to
smile
mouret
had
slowly
laid
the
lists
on
the
table
and
stood
looking
at
denise
who
had
remained
seated
pen
in
hand
she
did
not
avert
her
gaze
but
she
had
merely
turned
paler
you
will
come
this
evening
asked
he
no
sir
i
can
not
my
brothers
are
to
be
at
my
uncle
and
i
have
promised
to
dine
with
them
but
your
foot
you
walk
with
such
difficulty
oh
i
can
get
so
far
very
well
i
feel
much
better
since
the
morning
in
his
turn
he
had
turned
pale
on
hearing
this
quiet
refusal
a
nervous
revolt
made
his
lips
quiver
however
he
restrained
himself
and
with
the
air
of
a
master
simply
interesting
himself
in
one
of
his
young
ladies
resumed
come
now
if
i
begged
of
you
you
know
what
great
esteem
i
have
for
you
denise
retained
her
respectful
attitude
i
am
deeply
touched
sir
by
your
kindness
to
me
and
thank
you
for
this
invitation
but
i
repeat
i
can
not
my
brothers
expect
me
this
evening
she
persisted
in
not
understanding
the
door
remained
open
and
she
felt
that
the
whole
shop
was
urging
her
on
to
ruin
pauline
had
amicably
called
her
a
great
simpleton
the
others
would
laugh
at
her
if
she
refused
the
invitation
madame
aurélie
who
had
gone
away
marguerite
whose
rising
voice
she
could
hear
lhomme
whom
she
could
espy
sitting
motionless
and
discreet
all
these
people
were
wishing
for
her
fall
and
the
distant
roar
of
the
the
millions
of
goods
enumerated
on
all
sides
and
thrown
about
in
every
direction
were
like
a
warm
breeze
wafting
the
breath
of
passion
towards
her
there
was
a
silence
now
and
again
mouret
voice
was
drowned
by
the
noisy
accompaniment
the
formidable
uproar
of
a
kingly
fortune
gained
in
battle
when
will
you
come
then
he
asked
again
this
simple
question
troubled
denise
she
lost
her
calmness
for
a
moment
and
stammered
i
do
know
i
ca
he
smiled
and
tried
to
take
her
hand
which
she
withheld
what
are
you
afraid
of
he
asked
but
she
quickly
raised
her
head
looked
him
straight
in
the
face
and
smiling
with
her
sweet
brave
look
replied
i
am
afraid
of
nothing
sir
i
can
do
as
i
like
can
i
not
i
do
wish
to
that
all
as
she
finished
speaking
she
was
surprised
to
hear
a
creaking
noise
and
on
turning
round
saw
the
door
slowly
closing
it
was
inspector
jouve
who
had
taken
upon
himself
to
pull
it
to
the
doors
were
a
part
of
his
duty
none
ought
ever
to
remain
open
and
he
gravely
resumed
his
position
as
sentinel
no
one
appeared
to
have
noticed
that
this
door
was
being
closed
in
such
a
simple
manner
clara
alone
risked
a
strong
remark
in
the
ear
of
mademoiselle
de
fontenailles
but
the
face
remained
expressionless
denise
however
had
risen
mouret
was
saying
to
her
in
a
low
and
trembling
voice
listen
denise
i
love
you
you
have
long
known
it
pray
do
be
so
cruel
as
to
play
the
ignorant
i
love
you
denise
she
was
standing
there
very
pale
listening
to
him
and
still
looking
straight
into
his
face
tell
me
he
went
on
why
do
you
refuse
have
you
no
wants
your
brothers
are
a
heavy
burden
anything
you
might
ask
of
me
anything
you
might
require
of
me
but
with
a
word
she
stopped
him
thanks
i
now
earn
more
than
i
need
but
it
perfect
liberty
that
i
am
offering
you
an
existence
of
pleasure
and
luxury
i
will
set
you
up
in
a
home
of
your
own
i
will
assure
you
a
little
fortune
no
thanks
i
should
soon
get
tired
of
doing
nothing
i
earned
my
own
living
before
i
was
ten
years
old
he
made
a
wild
gesture
this
was
the
first
one
who
did
not
yield
with
the
others
he
had
merely
had
to
stoop
his
passion
long
restrained
goaded
on
by
resistance
became
stronger
than
ever
and
he
pressed
her
more
and
more
urgently
but
without
faltering
she
each
time
replied
no
no
then
at
last
he
let
this
escape
him
but
do
you
see
that
i
am
suffering
yes
it
stupid
but
i
am
suffering
like
a
child
tears
came
into
his
eyes
a
fresh
silence
reigned
they
could
still
hear
the
softened
roar
of
the
behind
the
closed
door
it
was
like
a
dying
note
of
triumph
the
accompaniment
subsided
into
a
lower
key
in
presence
of
this
defeat
of
the
master
and
yet
if
i
liked
he
said
in
an
ardent
voice
seizing
her
hands
she
left
them
in
his
her
eyes
turned
pale
her
whole
strength
was
deserting
her
a
warmth
came
from
this
man
burning
grasp
filling
her
with
a
delicious
cowardice
good
heavens
how
she
loved
him
and
with
what
delight
she
could
have
hung
on
his
neck
and
remained
there
but
in
his
passionate
excitement
he
grew
brutal
she
set
up
a
low
cry
the
pain
she
felt
at
her
wrists
restored
her
courage
with
an
angry
shake
she
freed
herself
then
very
stiff
looking
taller
in
her
weakness
no
leave
me
alone
i
am
not
a
clara
to
be
thrown
over
in
a
day
besides
you
love
another
yes
that
lady
who
comes
here
i
do
not
accept
half
an
affection
he
remained
motionless
with
surprise
what
was
she
saying
and
what
did
she
want
the
other
girls
had
never
asked
to
be
loved
he
ought
to
have
laughed
at
such
an
idea
yet
this
attitude
of
tender
pride
completely
conquered
his
heart
now
sir
please
open
the
door
she
resumed
it
is
not
proper
that
we
should
be
shut
up
together
in
this
way
he
obeyed
and
with
his
temples
throbbing
hardly
knowing
how
to
conceal
his
anguish
he
recalled
madame
aurélie
and
broke
out
angrily
about
the
stock
of
cloaks
saying
that
the
prices
must
be
lowered
until
every
one
had
been
got
rid
of
such
was
the
rule
of
the
house
a
clean
sweep
was
made
every
year
they
sold
at
sixty
per
cent
loss
rather
than
keep
an
old
pattern
or
any
stale
material
at
that
moment
bourdoncle
seeking
mouret
was
waiting
for
him
outside
having
been
stopped
before
the
closed
door
by
jouve
who
had
whispered
a
word
in
his
ear
with
a
grave
air
he
got
very
impatient
without
however
summoning
up
sufficient
courage
to
interrupt
the
governor
was
it
possible
on
such
a
day
too
and
with
that
creature
and
when
mouret
at
last
came
out
bourdoncle
spoke
to
him
about
the
fancy
silks
of
which
the
stock
left
on
hand
would
be
something
enormous
this
was
a
relief
for
mouret
as
it
gave
him
an
opportunity
for
shouting
what
the
devil
was
bouthemont
thinking
about
he
went
off
declaring
that
he
could
not
allow
a
buyer
to
display
such
lack
of
sense
as
to
buy
beyond
the
requirements
of
the
business
what
is
the
matter
with
him
murmured
madame
aurélie
quite
overcome
by
his
reproaches
while
the
young
ladies
looked
at
each
other
in
surprise
at
six
the
was
finished
the
sun
was
still
shining
a
fair
summer
sun
whose
golden
reflections
streamed
through
the
glazed
roofs
of
the
halls
in
the
heavy
air
of
the
streets
tired
families
were
already
returning
from
the
suburbs
laden
with
bouquets
and
dragging
their
children
along
one
by
one
the
departments
had
become
silent
in
the
depths
of
the
galleries
you
now
only
heard
the
lingering
calls
of
a
few
men
clearing
a
last
shelf
then
even
these
voices
ceased
and
of
all
the
bustle
of
the
day
there
only
remained
a
quivering
vibration
above
the
formidable
piles
of
goods
the
shelves
cupboards
boxes
and
were
now
empty
not
a
yard
of
stuff
not
an
object
of
any
sort
had
remained
in
its
place
the
vast
establishment
displayed
but
the
carcase
of
its
usual
appearance
the
woodwork
was
absolutely
bare
as
on
the
day
of
taking
possession
this
bareness
was
the
visible
proof
of
the
complete
exact
taking
of
the
stock
and
on
the
floor
was
sixteen
million
francs
worth
of
goods
a
rising
sea
which
had
finished
by
submerging
the
tables
and
counters
however
the
shopmen
surrounded
to
the
shoulders
began
to
put
each
article
back
into
its
place
they
expected
to
finish
by
about
ten
when
madame
aurélie
who
went
to
the
first
dinner
came
back
from
the
she
announced
the
amount
of
business
done
during
the
year
which
the
totals
of
the
various
departments
had
just
enabled
one
to
arrive
at
the
figure
was
eighty
million
francs
ten
millions
more
than
the
previous
year
the
only
real
decrease
had
been
on
the
fancy
silks
if
monsieur
mouret
is
not
satisfied
i
should
like
to
know
what
more
he
wants
added
the
see
he
fuming
over
there
at
the
top
of
the
grand
staircase
the
young
ladies
went
to
look
at
him
he
was
standing
alone
with
a
sombre
countenance
above
the
millions
scattered
at
his
feet
madame
said
denise
at
this
moment
would
you
kindly
let
me
go
away
now
i
ca
do
anything
more
on
account
of
my
foot
and
as
i
am
to
dine
at
my
uncle
with
my
brothers
they
were
all
astonished
she
had
not
yielded
then
madame
aurélie
hesitated
and
speaking
in
a
sharp
and
disagreeable
voice
seemed
inclined
to
forbid
her
going
out
whilst
clara
shrugged
her
shoulders
full
of
incredulity
when
pauline
learnt
the
news
she
was
in
the
department
with
deloche
and
the
sudden
joy
exhibited
by
the
young
man
made
her
very
angry
as
for
bourdoncle
who
did
not
dare
to
approach
mouret
in
his
savage
isolation
he
marched
up
and
down
amidst
these
rumours
in
despair
also
and
full
of
anxiety
however
denise
went
down
as
she
slowly
reached
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
leaning
on
the
banister
she
came
upon
a
group
of
grinning
salesmen
her
name
was
pronounced
and
she
realized
that
they
were
talking
about
her
adventure
they
had
not
noticed
her
descent
oh
all
that
put
on
you
know
favier
was
saying
she
full
of
vice
yes
i
know
some
one
whom
she
set
her
eyes
on
and
thereupon
he
glanced
at
hutin
who
in
order
to
preserve
his
dignity
as
was
standing
a
short
distance
away
without
joining
in
their
conversation
however
he
was
so
flattered
by
the
envious
air
with
which
the
others
contemplated
him
that
he
deigned
to
murmur
she
was
a
regular
nuisance
to
me
was
that
girl
denise
wounded
to
the
heart
clung
to
the
banister
they
must
have
seen
her
for
they
all
disappeared
laughing
he
was
right
she
thought
and
she
reproached
herself
for
her
former
ignorance
when
she
had
been
wont
to
think
of
him
but
what
a
coward
he
was
and
how
she
scorned
him
now
a
great
trouble
had
come
upon
her
was
it
not
strange
that
she
should
have
found
the
strength
just
now
to
repulse
a
man
whom
she
adored
when
she
had
felt
herself
so
feeble
in
bygone
days
before
that
worthless
fellow
whom
she
had
only
dreamed
of
her
sense
of
reason
and
her
bravery
foundered
in
these
contradictions
of
her
being
which
she
could
not
clearly
read
then
she
hastened
to
cross
the
hall
but
a
sort
of
instinct
prompted
her
to
raise
her
head
whilst
an
inspector
was
opening
the
door
closed
since
the
morning
and
still
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
on
the
great
central
landing
dominating
the
gallery
she
perceived
mouret
he
had
quite
forgotten
the
he
no
longer
beheld
his
empire
that
building
bursting
with
riches
everything
had
disappeared
his
former
uproarious
victories
his
future
colossal
fortune
with
a
desponding
look
he
was
watching
denise
and
when
she
had
crossed
the
threshold
everything
disappeared
a
darkness
came
over
the
house
chapter
xi
that
day
bouthemont
was
the
first
to
arrive
at
madame
desforges
four
tea
waiting
alone
in
her
large
louis
xvi
the
brasses
and
brocatel
of
which
shone
with
a
clear
gaiety
she
rose
with
an
air
of
impatience
saying
well
well
replied
the
young
man
when
i
told
him
that
i
should
no
doubt
call
on
you
he
formally
promised
me
to
come
you
made
him
thoroughly
understand
that
i
expected
the
baron
certainly
that
what
appeared
to
decide
him
they
were
speaking
of
mouret
who
the
year
before
had
suddenly
taken
such
a
liking
to
bouthemont
that
he
had
admitted
him
to
share
his
pleasures
and
had
even
introduced
him
to
henriette
glad
to
have
an
agreeable
fellow
always
at
hand
to
enliven
an
acquaintanceship
of
which
he
was
getting
tired
it
was
thus
that
bouthemont
had
ultimately
become
the
confidant
of
his
employer
and
the
handsome
widow
he
did
their
little
errands
talked
of
the
one
to
the
other
and
sometimes
reconciled
them
henriette
in
her
jealous
fits
displayed
a
familiarity
which
sometimes
surprised
and
embarrassed
him
for
she
was
losing
the
prudence
of
a
woman
of
the
world
who
employed
all
her
art
to
save
appearances
you
ought
to
have
brought
him
she
exclaimed
violently
i
should
have
been
sure
then
well
said
he
with
a
laugh
it
is
my
fault
if
he
escapes
so
frequently
now
oh
he
very
fond
of
me
all
the
same
were
it
not
for
him
i
should
be
in
a
bad
way
at
the
shop
his
situation
at
the
ladies
paradise
had
really
been
menaced
since
the
last
it
was
in
vain
that
he
talked
of
the
rainy
season
they
could
not
overlook
the
considerable
stock
of
fancy
silks
left
on
hand
and
as
hutin
was
improving
the
occasion
undermining
him
with
the
governors
with
an
increase
of
sly
ferocity
he
could
feel
the
ground
giving
way
beneath
him
mouret
had
condemned
him
weary
already
no
doubt
of
this
witness
who
prevented
him
from
breaking
off
with
henriette
and
tired
of
an
acquaintanceship
which
yielded
no
profit
but
in
accordance
with
his
usual
tactics
he
was
pushing
bourdoncle
forward
it
was
bourdoncle
and
the
other
partners
who
insisted
on
bouthemont
dismissal
at
each
board
meeting
whilst
he
according
to
his
own
account
resisted
then
defending
his
friend
energetically
at
the
risk
even
of
getting
into
serious
trouble
with
the
others
well
i
shall
wait
resumed
madame
desforges
you
know
that
the
girl
is
to
be
here
at
five
i
want
to
see
them
face
to
face
i
must
discover
their
secret
and
thereupon
she
reverted
to
her
plan
mentioning
in
her
agitation
that
she
had
requested
madame
aurélie
to
send
her
denise
to
look
at
a
mantle
which
fitted
badly
when
she
should
once
have
got
the
young
girl
in
her
room
she
would
find
some
reason
for
calling
mouret
and
would
then
act
bouthemont
who
had
sat
down
opposite
to
her
was
gazing
at
her
with
his
handsome
laughing
eyes
which
he
was
endeavouring
to
keep
serious
this
jovial
fellow
with
beard
this
dissipated
blade
whose
warm
gascon
blood
empurpled
his
cheeks
was
thinking
that
fine
ladies
were
not
of
much
account
after
all
and
let
out
a
nice
lot
of
things
when
they
ventured
to
open
their
hearts
come
he
made
bold
to
say
at
last
what
can
that
matter
to
you
since
i
assure
you
that
there
is
nothing
whatever
between
them
just
so
she
cried
it
because
he
loves
her
i
do
care
a
fig
for
the
others
the
chance
acquaintances
the
friends
of
a
day
she
spoke
of
clara
with
disdain
she
was
well
aware
that
mouret
after
denise
rejection
had
fallen
back
on
that
tall
girl
with
the
horse
head
and
he
had
done
this
doubtless
by
calculation
for
he
maintained
her
in
the
department
loading
her
with
presents
moreover
for
the
last
three
months
he
had
been
leading
a
terribly
dissipated
life
squandering
his
money
in
costly
and
stupid
caprices
with
a
prodigality
which
caused
many
remarks
it
that
creature
fault
repeated
henriette
i
feel
sure
ruining
himself
with
others
because
she
repulses
him
besides
his
money
to
me
i
should
have
preferred
him
poor
you
know
how
fond
i
am
of
him
you
who
have
become
our
friend
she
stopped
short
half
choking
ready
to
burst
into
tears
and
in
her
emotion
she
held
out
her
hands
to
him
it
was
true
she
adored
mouret
for
his
youth
and
his
triumphs
never
before
had
any
man
thus
conquered
her
but
at
the
thought
of
losing
him
she
also
heard
the
knell
of
her
fortieth
year
and
asked
herself
with
terror
how
she
should
replace
this
great
affection
i
have
my
revenge
she
murmured
i
have
my
revenge
if
he
behaves
badly
bouthemont
continued
to
hold
her
hands
in
his
she
was
still
handsome
but
hers
would
be
a
troublesome
acquaintance
to
keep
up
and
he
did
not
care
for
that
style
of
woman
the
matter
however
deserved
thinking
over
perhaps
it
would
be
worth
his
while
to
risk
some
annoyance
why
do
you
set
up
on
your
own
account
she
asked
all
at
once
drawing
her
hands
away
for
a
moment
he
was
astonished
then
he
replied
but
it
would
require
an
immense
sum
last
year
i
had
such
an
idea
in
my
head
i
feel
convinced
that
there
are
enough
customers
in
paris
for
one
or
two
more
big
shops
but
the
district
would
have
to
be
well
chosen
the
bon
marché
holds
the
left
side
of
the
river
the
louvre
occupies
the
centre
of
the
city
we
monopolize
at
the
paradise
the
rich
district
there
remains
the
north
where
one
might
start
a
rival
establishment
to
the
place
clichy
and
i
had
discovered
a
splendid
position
near
the
opera
house
well
why
not
she
asked
he
set
up
a
noisy
laugh
just
fancy
he
replied
i
was
stupid
enough
to
go
and
talk
to
my
father
about
it
yes
i
was
simple
enough
to
ask
him
to
find
me
some
shareholders
at
toulouse
and
he
gaily
described
the
anger
of
the
old
man
who
remained
buried
in
his
little
country
shop
full
of
rage
against
the
great
parisian
bazaars
bursting
at
the
thought
of
the
thirty
thousand
francs
a
year
which
his
son
earned
he
had
replied
that
he
would
sooner
give
his
money
and
that
of
his
friends
to
the
hospitals
than
contribute
a
copper
to
one
of
those
great
establishments
which
were
the
pests
of
trade
besides
the
young
man
concluded
it
would
require
millions
suppose
they
were
found
observed
madame
desforges
quietly
he
looked
at
her
becoming
serious
all
at
once
was
not
this
merely
a
jealous
woman
remark
however
she
did
not
give
him
time
to
question
her
but
added
in
short
you
know
what
a
great
interest
i
take
in
you
we
talk
about
it
again
the
outer
bell
had
just
rung
she
got
up
and
he
himself
drew
back
his
chair
with
an
instinctive
movement
as
if
some
one
might
have
surprised
them
silence
reigned
in
the
with
its
gay
hangings
and
decorated
with
such
a
profusion
of
green
plants
that
there
was
like
a
small
wood
between
the
two
windows
henriette
stood
waiting
with
her
ear
towards
the
door
it
is
he
she
murmured
the
footman
announced
monsieur
mouret
and
monsieur
de
vallagnosc
henriette
could
not
restrain
a
movement
of
anger
why
had
he
not
come
alone
he
must
have
gone
for
his
friend
fearful
of
a
with
her
however
she
smiled
and
shook
hands
with
both
men
what
a
stranger
you
are
becoming
i
say
the
same
for
you
monsieur
de
vallagnosc
her
great
grief
was
that
she
was
getting
stout
and
she
now
squeezed
herself
into
the
tightest
fitting
black
silk
dresses
in
order
to
conceal
her
increasing
corpulency
yet
her
pretty
head
with
its
dark
hair
preserved
its
pleasing
shapeliness
and
mouret
could
familiarly
tell
her
as
he
enveloped
her
with
a
look
it
useless
to
ask
after
your
health
you
are
as
fresh
as
a
rose
oh
i
almost
too
well
she
replied
besides
i
might
have
died
you
would
have
known
nothing
about
it
she
was
examining
him
also
and
thought
that
he
looked
tired
and
nervous
his
eyes
heavy
his
complexion
livid
well
she
resumed
in
a
tone
which
she
endeavoured
to
render
agreeable
i
can
not
return
your
compliment
you
do
look
at
all
well
this
evening
overwork
remarked
vallagnosc
mouret
shrugged
his
shoulders
without
replying
he
had
just
caught
sight
of
bouthemont
and
nodded
to
him
in
a
friendly
way
during
their
closer
intimacy
he
himself
had
been
wont
to
take
him
away
from
the
department
and
bring
him
to
henriette
during
the
busiest
moments
of
the
afternoon
but
times
had
changed
and
he
now
said
to
him
in
an
undertone
you
went
away
very
early
they
noticed
your
departure
and
are
furious
about
it
he
referred
to
bourdoncle
and
the
other
persons
who
had
an
interest
in
the
business
as
if
he
were
not
himself
the
master
ah
murmured
bouthemont
anxiously
yes
i
want
to
talk
to
you
wait
for
me
we
leave
together
henriette
had
now
sat
down
again
and
while
listening
to
vallagnosc
who
was
announcing
that
madame
de
boves
would
probably
pay
her
a
visit
she
did
not
take
her
eyes
off
mouret
the
latter
again
silent
gazed
at
the
furniture
and
seemed
to
be
looking
for
something
on
the
ceiling
then
as
she
laughingly
complained
that
she
now
only
had
gentlemen
at
her
four
tea
he
so
far
forgot
himself
as
to
blurt
out
i
expected
to
find
baron
hartmann
here
henriette
turned
pale
no
doubt
she
well
knew
that
he
merely
came
to
her
house
to
meet
the
baron
still
he
might
have
avoided
throwing
his
indifference
in
her
face
like
that
at
that
moment
the
door
had
opened
and
the
footman
was
standing
behind
her
when
she
had
interrogated
him
by
a
sign
the
servant
leant
over
and
said
in
a
very
low
tone
it
for
that
mantle
madame
wished
me
to
let
her
know
the
young
woman
is
there
henriette
at
once
raised
her
voice
so
as
to
be
heard
and
all
her
jealous
suffering
found
relief
in
these
scornfully
harsh
words
she
can
wait
shall
i
show
her
into
madame
asked
the
servant
no
no
let
her
stay
in
the
and
when
the
servant
had
gone
she
quietly
resumed
her
conversation
with
vallagnosc
mouret
who
had
relapsed
into
his
former
lassitude
had
listened
in
an
way
without
understanding
while
bouthemont
worried
by
the
adventure
remained
buried
in
thought
almost
at
that
moment
however
the
door
was
opened
again
and
two
ladies
were
shown
in
just
fancy
said
madame
marty
i
was
alighting
at
the
door
when
i
saw
madame
de
boves
coming
along
under
the
arcade
yes
explained
the
latter
it
a
fine
day
and
my
doctor
says
i
must
take
walking
exercise
then
after
a
general
she
inquired
of
henriette
so
you
engaging
a
new
maid
no
replied
the
other
astonished
why
because
i
just
seen
a
young
woman
in
the
henriette
interrupted
her
laughing
it
true
all
those
look
like
ladies
maids
do
they
yes
it
a
young
person
come
to
alter
a
mantle
mouret
gazed
at
her
intently
a
suspicion
flashing
across
his
mind
but
she
went
on
with
a
forced
gaiety
explaining
that
she
had
bought
the
mantle
in
question
at
the
ladies
paradise
during
the
previous
week
what
asked
madame
marty
have
you
deserted
sauveur
then
no
my
dear
but
i
wished
to
make
an
experiment
besides
i
was
pretty
well
satisfied
with
a
first
purchase
i
made
a
travelling
cloak
but
this
time
it
has
not
succeeded
at
all
you
may
say
what
you
like
one
is
horribly
rigged
out
in
the
big
shops
i
speak
out
plainly
even
before
monsieur
mouret
he
will
never
know
how
to
dress
a
woman
who
is
in
the
least
degree
stylish
mouret
did
not
defend
his
establishment
but
still
kept
his
eyes
on
her
consoling
himself
with
the
thought
that
she
would
never
have
dared
to
do
what
he
had
suspected
and
it
was
bouthemont
who
had
to
plead
the
cause
of
the
ladies
paradise
if
all
the
aristocratic
ladies
who
patronize
us
were
to
proclaim
it
he
retorted
gaily
you
would
be
astonished
by
the
names
of
our
customers
order
a
garment
to
measure
at
our
place
it
will
equal
one
from
sauveur
and
cost
you
but
half
the
money
but
there
just
because
it
cheaper
it
not
so
good
so
it
does
fit
the
mantle
you
speak
of
resumed
madame
de
boves
ah
now
i
remember
the
young
person
it
rather
dark
in
your
yes
added
madame
marty
i
was
wondering
where
i
had
seen
that
figure
before
well
go
my
dear
do
stand
on
ceremony
with
us
henriette
assumed
a
look
of
disdainful
unconcern
oh
presently
there
is
no
hurry
then
the
ladies
continued
the
discussion
on
the
garments
sold
at
the
large
establishments
and
afterwards
madame
de
boves
spoke
of
her
husband
who
said
she
had
gone
to
inspect
the
at
while
at
the
same
time
henriette
related
that
owing
to
the
illness
of
an
aunt
madame
guibal
had
been
suddenly
called
into
moreover
she
did
not
reckon
that
day
on
seeing
madame
bourdelais
either
for
at
the
end
of
every
month
the
latter
shut
herself
up
with
a
needlewoman
to
look
over
her
young
people
clothes
madame
marty
meantime
seemed
agitated
by
some
secret
trouble
her
position
at
the
lycée
bonaparte
was
menaced
in
consequence
of
the
lessons
which
the
poor
man
gave
in
certain
private
establishments
where
a
regular
trade
was
carried
on
in
diplomas
he
now
feverishly
earned
money
wherever
he
could
in
order
to
meet
the
rage
for
spending
which
was
pillaging
his
household
and
his
wife
on
seeing
him
weeping
one
evening
from
fear
of
dismissal
had
conceived
the
idea
of
asking
her
friend
henriette
to
speak
to
a
director
at
the
ministry
of
public
instruction
with
whom
she
was
acquainted
henriette
finished
by
quieting
her
with
a
few
words
monsieur
marty
however
was
coming
himself
that
afternoon
to
learn
his
fate
and
thank
her
you
look
unwell
monsieur
mouret
all
at
once
observed
madame
de
boves
overwork
repeated
vallagnosc
with
ironic
apathy
mouret
quickly
rose
as
if
ashamed
of
forgetting
himself
in
this
fashion
he
took
his
accustomed
place
in
the
midst
of
the
ladies
and
recovered
all
his
agreeable
manners
he
was
now
busy
with
the
winter
novelties
and
spoke
of
a
considerable
arrival
of
lace
whereupon
madame
de
boves
questioned
him
as
to
the
price
of
alençon
point
she
felt
inclined
to
buy
some
she
was
however
now
obliged
to
be
sparing
of
even
thirty
sous
for
a
cab
fare
and
would
return
home
quite
ill
from
the
effects
of
stopping
before
the
displays
in
the
shop
windows
draped
in
a
mantle
which
was
already
two
years
old
she
tried
in
imagination
on
her
queenly
shoulders
all
the
most
expensive
garments
she
saw
and
it
was
as
though
they
had
been
torn
from
off
her
when
she
awoke
and
found
herself
still
wearing
her
dresses
without
the
slightest
hope
of
ever
satisfying
her
passion
baron
hartmann
now
announced
the
footman
henriette
observed
with
what
pleasure
mouret
shook
hands
with
the
new
arrival
the
latter
bowed
to
the
ladies
and
glanced
at
the
young
man
with
that
subtle
expression
which
sometimes
illumined
his
big
alsatian
face
always
plunged
in
dress
he
murmured
with
a
smile
and
like
a
friend
of
the
house
he
ventured
to
add
there
a
charming
young
person
in
the
who
is
she
oh
nobody
replied
madame
desforges
in
her
voice
only
a
waiting
to
see
me
the
door
had
remained
as
the
servant
was
bringing
in
the
tea
he
went
out
came
in
again
placed
the
china
service
on
the
table
and
then
brought
some
plates
of
sandwiches
and
biscuits
in
the
spacious
room
a
bright
light
softened
by
the
green
plants
illumined
the
and
bathed
the
silk
hangings
in
a
tender
glow
and
each
time
the
door
opened
one
could
perceive
a
dim
corner
of
the
which
was
only
lighted
by
two
windows
there
in
the
gloom
appeared
a
sombre
form
motionless
and
patient
denise
was
standing
there
was
indeed
a
bench
there
but
a
feeling
of
pride
prevented
her
from
sitting
down
on
it
she
felt
the
insult
intended
her
she
had
been
there
for
the
last
without
a
sign
without
a
word
the
ladies
and
the
baron
had
taken
stock
of
her
in
passing
she
could
now
just
hear
the
voices
from
the
all
the
pleasant
luxury
wounded
her
with
its
indifference
and
still
she
did
not
move
suddenly
however
through
the
doorway
she
perceived
mouret
and
he
on
his
side
had
at
last
guessed
it
to
be
her
is
it
one
of
your
saleswomen
asked
baron
hartmann
mouret
had
succeeded
in
concealing
his
great
distress
of
mind
still
his
voice
trembled
somewhat
with
emotion
no
doubt
but
i
do
know
which
it
the
little
fair
girl
from
the
mantle
department
replied
madame
marty
obligingly
the
i
believe
henriette
looked
at
mouret
in
her
turn
ah
said
he
simply
and
then
he
tried
to
change
the
conversation
speaking
of
the
fêtes
that
were
being
given
to
the
king
of
prussia
who
had
arrived
in
paris
the
day
before
but
the
baron
maliciously
reverted
to
the
young
ladies
in
the
big
establishments
he
pretended
to
be
desirous
of
gaining
information
and
put
several
questions
where
did
they
come
from
in
general
was
their
conduct
as
bad
as
it
was
said
to
be
quite
a
discussion
ensued
really
he
repeated
you
think
them
mouret
defended
their
conduct
with
a
conviction
which
made
vallagnosc
smile
bouthemont
then
interfered
to
save
his
chief
of
course
there
were
some
of
all
sorts
bad
and
good
though
they
were
all
improving
formerly
they
had
secured
nothing
but
the
refuse
of
the
trade
a
poor
doubtful
class
of
girls
who
had
drifted
into
the
drapery
business
whereas
now
respectable
families
in
the
rue
de
sèvres
positively
brought
up
their
daughters
for
the
bon
marché
in
short
when
they
liked
to
conduct
themselves
well
they
could
for
they
were
not
like
the
of
paris
obliged
to
board
and
lodge
themselves
they
had
bed
and
board
given
them
their
existence
though
an
extremely
hard
one
no
doubt
was
at
all
events
provided
for
the
worst
was
their
neutral
position
something
between
the
shopwoman
and
the
lady
thrown
into
the
midst
of
luxury
often
without
any
primary
instruction
they
formed
a
nameless
class
apart
from
all
others
their
misfortunes
and
vices
sprang
from
that
for
myself
said
madame
de
boves
i
do
know
any
creatures
who
are
more
disagreeable
really
one
could
slap
them
at
times
and
then
the
ladies
vented
their
spite
quite
a
battle
was
waged
at
the
where
woman
was
pitted
against
woman
in
a
sharp
rivalry
of
wealth
and
beauty
there
was
the
sullen
jealousy
of
the
saleswomen
towards
the
customers
the
ladies
whose
manners
they
tried
to
imitate
and
there
was
a
still
stronger
feeling
on
the
part
of
the
customers
those
of
the
lower
against
the
saleswomen
those
girls
arrayed
in
silk
from
whom
they
would
have
liked
to
exact
a
servant
humility
even
in
the
serving
of
a
half
franc
purchase
do
speak
of
them
said
henriette
by
way
of
conclusion
they
are
a
wretched
lot
as
worthless
as
the
goods
they
sell
mouret
had
the
strength
to
smile
the
baron
was
looking
at
him
so
touched
by
his
graceful
command
over
himself
that
he
changed
the
conversation
returning
to
the
fêtes
that
were
being
given
to
the
king
of
prussia
they
would
be
superb
said
he
the
whole
trade
of
paris
would
profit
by
them
henriette
meanwhile
remained
silent
and
thoughtful
divided
between
the
desire
to
let
denise
remain
forgotten
in
the
and
the
fear
that
mouret
now
aware
of
her
presence
might
go
away
at
last
she
rose
from
her
chair
you
will
allow
me
said
she
certainly
my
dear
replied
madame
marty
i
will
do
the
honours
of
the
house
for
you
she
got
up
took
the
teapot
and
filled
the
cups
henriette
turned
towards
baron
hartmann
saying
you
will
stay
a
few
minutes
you
yes
i
want
to
speak
to
monsieur
mouret
we
are
going
to
invade
your
little
she
went
out
and
her
black
silk
dress
in
rustling
against
the
door
made
a
noise
like
that
of
a
snake
wriggling
through
brushwood
the
baron
at
once
manœuvred
to
carry
mouret
off
leaving
the
ladies
to
bouthemont
and
vallagnosc
then
they
stood
talking
before
the
window
of
the
other
room
in
a
low
tone
a
fresh
affair
was
in
question
for
a
long
time
past
mouret
had
cherished
a
desire
to
realize
his
former
project
the
invasion
of
the
whole
block
of
building
from
the
rue
monsigny
to
the
rue
de
la
michodière
and
from
the
rue
to
the
rue
du
by
the
paradise
of
this
enormous
square
there
still
remained
a
large
plot
of
ground
fronting
the
last
named
street
which
he
had
not
acquired
and
this
sufficed
to
spoil
his
triumph
he
was
tormented
by
a
desire
to
complete
his
conquest
to
erect
there
a
sort
of
apotheosis
a
monumental
façade
as
long
as
his
principal
entrance
should
remain
in
the
rue
in
a
dark
street
of
olden
paris
his
work
would
be
incomplete
deficient
in
logic
he
wished
to
set
it
up
face
to
face
with
new
paris
in
one
of
those
modern
avenues
through
which
the
busy
multitude
of
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
passed
in
the
full
glare
of
the
sunlight
he
could
imagine
it
dominating
imposing
itself
as
the
giant
palace
of
commerce
casting
even
a
greater
shadow
over
the
city
than
the
old
louvre
itself
but
hitherto
he
had
been
baulked
by
the
obstinacy
of
the
crédit
immobilier
which
still
clung
to
its
first
idea
of
building
a
rival
establishment
to
the
grand
hôtel
on
the
site
in
question
the
plans
were
ready
they
were
only
waiting
for
the
clearing
of
the
rue
du
to
begin
digging
the
foundations
at
last
however
by
a
supreme
effort
mouret
had
almost
convinced
baron
hartmann
well
the
latter
began
we
had
a
yesterday
and
i
came
thinking
i
should
meet
you
and
wishing
to
keep
you
informed
they
still
resist
the
young
man
allowed
a
nervous
gesture
to
escape
him
but
ridiculous
what
do
they
say
dear
me
they
say
what
i
have
said
to
you
myself
and
what
i
am
still
inclined
to
think
your
façade
is
only
an
ornament
the
new
buildings
would
only
increase
the
area
of
your
establishment
by
about
a
tenth
and
it
would
be
throwing
away
immense
sums
on
a
mere
advertisement
at
this
mouret
burst
out
an
advertisement
an
advertisement
in
any
case
this
one
would
be
in
stone
and
outlive
all
of
us
just
consider
that
it
would
increase
our
business
tenfold
we
should
see
our
money
back
in
two
years
how
can
ground
be
lost
if
it
returns
you
an
enormous
interest
you
will
see
what
crowds
we
shall
have
when
our
customers
are
no
longer
obliged
to
struggle
through
the
rue
but
can
pass
freely
down
a
thoroughfare
broad
enough
for
six
carriages
abreast
no
doubt
replied
the
baron
laughing
but
you
are
a
poet
in
your
way
let
me
tell
you
once
more
these
gentlemen
think
it
would
be
dangerous
for
you
to
extend
your
business
further
they
want
to
be
prudent
for
you
how
prudent
i
no
longer
understand
do
the
figures
show
the
constant
increase
in
our
sales
at
first
with
a
capital
of
five
hundred
thousand
francs
i
did
business
to
the
extent
of
two
millions
turning
over
the
capital
four
times
every
year
it
then
became
four
million
francs
which
turned
over
ten
times
produced
business
to
the
extent
of
forty
millions
in
short
after
successive
increases
i
have
just
learnt
from
the
last
that
the
business
done
now
amounts
to
a
total
of
eighty
millions
the
capital
which
has
only
been
slightly
increased
for
it
does
not
exceed
six
millions
has
passed
over
our
counters
in
the
form
of
goods
sold
more
than
twelve
times
in
the
year
he
raised
his
voice
and
tapped
the
fingers
of
his
right
hand
on
the
palm
of
his
left
knocking
down
those
millions
as
he
might
have
cracked
nuts
the
baron
interrupted
him
i
know
i
know
but
you
do
hope
to
keep
on
increasing
in
this
way
do
you
why
not
asked
mouret
ingenuously
there
no
reason
why
it
should
stop
the
capital
can
be
turned
over
as
many
as
fifteen
times
i
predicted
as
much
long
ago
in
certain
departments
it
can
even
be
turned
over
or
thirty
times
and
after
well
after
find
a
means
of
turning
it
over
still
more
so
you
finish
by
swallowing
up
all
the
money
in
paris
as
swallow
a
glass
of
water
most
decidedly
does
paris
belong
to
the
women
and
do
the
women
belong
to
us
the
baron
laid
his
hands
on
mouret
shoulders
looking
at
him
with
a
paternal
air
listen
you
a
fine
fellow
and
i
like
you
no
resisting
you
we
go
into
the
matter
seriously
and
i
hope
to
make
them
listen
to
reason
so
far
we
are
perfectly
satisfied
with
you
your
dividends
astonish
the
bourse
you
must
be
right
it
will
be
better
to
put
more
money
into
your
business
than
to
risk
this
competition
with
the
grand
hôtel
which
is
hazardous
mouret
excitement
at
once
subsided
and
he
thanked
the
baron
but
without
any
of
his
usual
enthusiasm
and
the
other
saw
him
turn
his
eyes
towards
the
door
of
the
next
room
again
a
prey
to
the
secret
anxiety
which
he
was
concealing
meanwhile
vallagnosc
had
come
up
on
seeing
that
they
had
finished
talking
business
he
stood
close
to
them
listening
to
the
baron
who
with
the
air
of
an
old
man
who
had
seen
life
was
muttering
i
say
i
fancy
they
taking
their
revenge
who
asked
mouret
in
embarrassment
why
the
women
they
getting
tired
of
belonging
to
you
and
you
now
belong
to
them
my
dear
fellow
it
only
just
then
he
joked
him
well
aware
as
he
was
of
the
young
man
notorious
love
affairs
the
enormous
sums
squandered
by
mouret
in
costly
and
stupid
caprices
amused
him
as
an
excuse
for
the
follies
which
he
had
formerly
committed
himself
his
old
experience
rejoiced
to
think
that
men
had
in
no
wise
changed
really
i
do
understand
you
repeated
mouret
oh
you
understand
well
enough
answered
the
baron
they
always
get
the
last
word
in
fact
i
thought
to
myself
it
is
possible
boasting
he
ca
be
so
strong
as
that
and
now
there
you
are
so
though
you
obtain
all
you
can
from
woman
and
work
her
as
you
would
a
coal
mine
it
simply
in
order
that
she
may
work
you
afterwards
and
force
you
to
refund
and
take
care
for
she
draw
more
money
from
you
than
you
have
ever
drawn
from
her
he
laughed
louder
still
and
vallagnosc
standing
by
also
began
to
grin
without
however
saying
a
word
dear
me
one
must
have
a
taste
of
everything
confessed
mouret
pretending
to
laugh
as
well
money
is
worthless
if
it
is
spent
as
for
that
i
agree
with
you
resumed
the
baron
enjoy
yourself
my
dear
fellow
i
not
be
the
one
to
preach
to
you
or
to
tremble
for
the
great
interests
we
have
confided
to
your
care
every
one
must
sow
his
wild
oats
and
his
head
is
generally
clearer
afterwards
besides
there
nothing
unpleasant
in
ruining
one
self
when
one
feels
capable
of
building
up
another
fortune
but
if
money
is
nothing
there
are
certain
sufferings
he
stopped
and
his
smile
became
sad
former
sufferings
doubtless
returned
to
his
mind
amid
the
irony
of
his
scepticism
he
had
watched
the
duel
between
henriette
and
mouret
with
the
curiosity
of
a
man
who
still
felt
greatly
interested
in
other
people
love
battles
and
he
divined
that
the
crisis
had
arrived
he
guessed
the
pending
drama
being
well
acquainted
with
the
story
of
that
girl
denise
whom
he
had
seen
in
the
oh
as
for
suffering
that
not
in
my
line
said
mouret
in
a
tone
of
bravado
it
quite
enough
to
have
to
pay
the
baron
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
without
speaking
and
not
wishing
to
insist
on
the
subject
he
added
slowly
do
make
yourself
out
to
be
worse
than
you
are
you
lose
something
else
besides
your
money
yes
you
lose
a
part
of
yourself
my
dear
fellow
then
he
broke
off
again
laughing
to
ask
that
often
happens
does
it
not
monsieur
de
vallagnosc
so
they
say
baron
the
latter
merely
replied
just
at
this
moment
the
door
opened
mouret
who
was
about
to
answer
in
his
turn
started
slightly
and
both
he
and
his
companions
turned
round
it
was
madame
desforges
who
looking
very
gay
had
put
her
head
through
the
doorway
to
call
in
a
hurried
voice
monsieur
mouret
monsieur
mouret
and
then
perceiving
the
others
she
added
oh
you
excuse
me
wo
you
gentlemen
i
going
to
take
monsieur
mouret
away
for
a
minute
the
least
he
can
do
as
he
has
sold
me
such
a
frightful
mantle
is
to
give
me
the
benefit
of
his
experience
this
girl
is
a
stupid
thing
without
an
idea
in
her
head
come
come
waiting
for
you
he
hesitated
undecided
flinching
from
the
scene
he
could
foresee
however
he
had
to
obey
go
my
dear
fellow
go
madame
wants
you
the
baron
said
to
him
with
his
air
at
once
paternal
and
mocking
thereupon
mouret
followed
her
the
door
closed
and
he
thought
he
could
hear
vallagnosc
laugh
muffled
by
the
hangings
his
courage
was
entirely
exhausted
since
henriette
had
quitted
the
and
he
had
known
denise
to
be
there
in
jealous
hands
he
had
experienced
a
growing
anxiety
a
nervous
torment
which
made
him
listen
from
time
to
time
as
if
suddenly
startled
by
a
distant
sound
of
weeping
what
could
that
woman
invent
to
torture
her
and
all
his
love
that
love
which
surprised
him
even
now
went
forth
to
the
girl
like
a
support
and
a
consolation
never
before
had
he
loved
like
this
found
such
a
powerful
charm
in
suffering
his
former
affections
his
love
for
henriette
herself
so
delicate
so
handsome
so
flattering
to
his
pride
had
never
been
more
than
agreeable
pastimes
whereas
nowadays
his
heart
beat
with
anguish
his
life
was
taken
he
could
no
longer
even
enjoy
the
forgetfulness
of
sleep
denise
was
ever
in
his
thoughts
even
at
this
moment
she
was
the
sole
object
of
his
anxiety
and
he
was
telling
himself
that
he
preferred
to
be
there
to
protect
her
notwithstanding
his
fear
of
some
regrettable
scene
with
the
one
he
was
following
at
first
they
both
crossed
the
silent
and
empty
then
madame
desforges
pushing
open
a
door
entered
the
with
mouret
behind
her
it
was
a
rather
large
room
hung
with
red
silk
and
furnished
with
a
marble
toilet
table
and
a
large
wardrobe
with
three
compartments
and
great
glass
doors
as
the
window
overlooked
the
it
was
already
rather
dark
and
the
two
gas
burners
on
either
side
of
the
wardrobe
had
been
lighted
now
let
see
said
henriette
perhaps
we
shall
get
on
better
on
entering
mouret
had
found
denise
standing
upright
in
the
middle
of
the
bright
light
she
was
very
pale
modestly
dressed
in
a
cashmere
jacket
with
a
black
hat
on
her
head
and
she
was
holding
the
mantle
purchased
at
the
ladies
paradise
when
she
saw
the
young
man
her
hands
slightly
trembled
i
wish
monsieur
mouret
to
judge
resumed
henriette
just
help
me
mademoiselle
then
denise
approaching
had
to
give
her
the
mantle
she
had
already
placed
some
pins
on
the
shoulders
the
part
that
did
not
fit
henriette
turned
round
to
look
at
herself
in
the
glass
is
it
possible
speak
frankly
said
she
it
really
is
a
failure
madame
replied
mouret
to
cut
the
matter
short
it
very
simple
the
young
lady
will
take
your
measure
and
we
will
make
you
another
no
i
want
this
one
i
want
it
immediately
she
resumed
with
vivacity
but
it
too
narrow
across
the
chest
and
it
forms
a
ruck
at
the
back
between
the
shoulders
then
in
her
sharpest
voice
she
added
it
no
use
for
you
to
stand
looking
at
me
mademoiselle
that
wo
make
it
any
better
try
and
find
a
remedy
it
your
business
denise
again
commenced
to
place
the
pins
without
saying
a
word
this
went
on
for
some
time
she
had
to
pass
from
one
shoulder
to
the
other
and
was
even
obliged
to
go
almost
on
her
knees
in
order
to
pull
the
mantle
down
in
front
above
her
placing
herself
entirely
in
her
hands
was
madame
desforges
imparting
to
her
face
the
harsh
expression
of
a
mistress
exceedingly
difficult
to
please
delighted
to
lower
the
young
girl
to
this
servant
work
she
gave
her
curt
orders
watching
the
while
for
the
least
sign
of
suffering
on
mouret
face
put
a
pin
here
no
not
there
here
near
the
sleeve
you
do
seem
to
understand
that
is
it
there
the
ruck
showing
again
take
care
you
pricking
me
now
twice
again
did
mouret
vainly
attempt
to
interfere
in
order
to
put
an
end
to
this
scene
his
heart
was
beating
violently
from
this
humiliation
of
his
love
and
he
loved
denise
more
than
ever
with
a
deep
tenderness
in
presence
of
her
admirably
silent
and
patient
demeanour
if
the
girl
hands
still
trembled
somewhat
at
being
treated
in
this
way
before
his
face
she
nevertheless
accepted
the
necessities
of
her
position
with
the
proud
resignation
of
one
who
was
courageous
when
madame
desforges
found
they
were
not
likely
to
betray
themselves
she
tried
another
device
she
began
to
smile
on
mouret
treating
him
openly
as
a
lover
the
pins
having
run
short
she
said
to
him
look
my
dear
in
the
ivory
box
on
the
really
empty
well
kindly
look
on
the
in
the
you
know
just
beside
the
she
spoke
as
if
he
were
quite
at
home
there
and
knew
where
to
find
everything
and
when
he
came
back
with
a
few
pins
she
took
them
one
by
one
and
forced
him
to
remain
near
her
looking
at
him
the
while
and
speaking
low
i
do
fancy
i
eh
give
me
your
hand
feel
my
shoulders
just
to
please
me
am
i
really
made
like
that
denise
slowly
raised
her
eyes
paler
than
ever
and
in
silence
set
about
placing
the
pins
mouret
could
only
see
her
heavy
blonde
tresses
twisted
at
the
back
of
her
delicate
neck
but
by
the
slight
tremor
which
was
raising
them
he
could
imagine
the
uneasiness
and
shame
of
her
face
hereafter
she
would
most
certainly
repulse
him
and
send
him
back
to
this
woman
who
did
not
conceal
her
affection
even
before
strangers
brutal
thoughts
came
into
his
head
he
could
have
struck
henriette
how
was
he
to
stop
her
talk
how
tell
denise
that
he
adored
her
that
she
alone
existed
for
him
at
this
moment
and
that
he
was
ready
to
sacrifice
for
her
all
his
former
caprices
of
a
day
the
worst
of
women
would
not
have
indulged
in
the
equivocal
familiarities
of
this
lady
at
last
he
withdrew
his
hand
saying
you
are
wrong
in
being
so
obstinate
madame
since
i
myself
consider
the
garment
to
be
a
failure
one
of
the
gas
jets
was
hissing
and
in
the
stuffy
moist
air
of
the
room
nothing
else
was
heard
but
that
ardent
sibilant
breath
on
the
red
silk
hangings
the
of
the
wardrobe
cast
broad
sheets
of
vivid
light
in
which
the
shadows
of
the
two
women
played
a
bottle
containing
some
essence
of
verbena
which
had
been
left
uncorked
inadvertently
emitted
a
vague
expiring
odour
of
fading
flowers
there
madame
that
is
all
i
can
do
at
last
said
denise
rising
up
she
felt
thoroughly
worn
out
twice
had
she
run
the
pins
into
her
fingers
as
if
blind
her
eyes
clouded
was
he
in
the
plot
had
he
sent
for
her
to
avenge
himself
for
her
refusal
by
showing
her
that
other
women
had
affection
for
him
this
thought
chilled
her
she
could
not
remember
having
ever
stood
in
need
of
so
much
courage
not
even
during
the
terrible
hours
of
her
life
when
she
had
lacked
bread
it
was
comparatively
nothing
to
be
humiliated
in
this
way
but
to
see
him
so
unconstrained
with
that
other
woman
was
dreadful
henriette
looked
at
herself
in
the
glass
and
once
more
burst
into
harsh
words
what
nonsense
mademoiselle
it
fits
worse
than
ever
just
see
how
tight
it
is
across
the
chest
i
look
like
a
wet
nurse
denise
losing
all
patience
thereupon
made
a
rather
unfortunate
remark
you
are
rather
stout
madame
we
can
not
make
you
thinner
than
you
are
stout
stout
exclaimed
henriette
turning
pale
in
her
turn
becoming
insolent
now
mademoiselle
really
i
should
advise
you
to
criticize
others
they
both
stood
looking
at
one
another
face
to
face
and
trembling
there
was
now
neither
lady
nor
left
they
were
simply
two
women
made
equal
by
their
rivalry
the
one
had
violently
taken
off
the
mantle
and
cast
it
on
a
chair
whilst
the
other
was
throwing
on
the
the
few
pins
still
remaining
in
her
hands
what
astonishes
me
resumed
henriette
is
that
monsieur
mouret
should
tolerate
such
insolence
i
thought
sir
that
you
were
more
particular
about
your
employees
denise
had
again
recovered
her
brave
calm
manner
if
monsieur
mouret
keeps
me
in
his
employ
she
gently
replied
it
because
he
has
no
fault
to
find
i
am
ready
to
apologize
to
you
if
he
desires
it
mouret
was
listening
excited
by
this
quarrel
but
unable
to
find
a
word
to
put
a
stop
to
it
he
had
a
great
horror
of
these
explanations
between
women
whose
asperity
clashed
with
his
perpetual
desire
for
grace
and
refinement
henriette
was
seeking
to
compel
him
to
say
something
in
condemnation
of
the
girl
and
as
he
still
remained
mute
and
undecided
she
stung
him
with
a
final
insult
very
good
sir
it
seems
that
i
must
suffer
the
insolence
of
your
mistresses
in
my
own
house
even
a
creature
you
picked
out
of
some
gutter
two
big
tears
gushed
from
denise
eyes
she
had
been
keeping
them
back
for
some
time
past
but
beneath
this
last
insult
her
whole
being
succumbed
and
when
he
saw
her
weeping
like
that
with
a
silent
despairing
dignity
never
making
the
slightest
attempt
at
retaliation
mouret
no
longer
hesitated
his
heart
went
forth
to
her
full
of
immense
affection
he
took
her
hands
in
his
and
stammered
go
away
quickly
my
child
and
forget
this
house
henriette
perfectly
amazed
choking
with
anger
stood
looking
at
them
wait
a
minute
he
continued
folding
up
the
mantle
himself
take
this
garment
away
madame
will
purchase
another
one
elsewhere
and
pray
do
cry
any
more
you
know
how
greatly
i
esteem
you
he
went
with
her
to
the
door
which
he
closed
behind
her
she
had
not
said
a
word
but
a
pink
flame
had
coloured
her
cheeks
whilst
her
eyes
moistened
with
fresh
tears
tears
of
a
delicious
sweetness
henriette
who
was
suffocating
had
taken
out
her
handkerchief
and
was
crushing
her
lips
with
it
this
was
a
total
overthrow
of
her
calculations
she
herself
had
been
caught
in
the
trap
she
had
laid
she
was
mortified
with
herself
for
having
carried
matters
too
far
and
bitterly
tortured
by
jealousy
to
be
abandoned
for
such
a
creature
as
that
to
see
herself
disdained
before
her
her
pride
suffered
even
more
than
her
affection
so
it
that
girl
you
love
she
said
painfully
when
they
were
alone
mouret
did
not
at
once
reply
he
was
walking
about
from
the
window
to
the
door
seeking
to
stifle
his
violent
emotion
at
last
however
he
stopped
and
very
politely
in
a
voice
which
he
tried
to
render
frigid
he
replied
in
all
simplicity
yes
madame
the
gas
jet
was
still
hissing
in
the
stuffy
air
of
the
but
the
reflections
of
the
glass
doors
were
no
longer
traversed
by
dancing
shadows
the
room
seemed
bare
and
full
of
profound
sadness
and
henriette
suddenly
dropped
upon
a
chair
twisting
her
handkerchief
between
her
febrile
fingers
and
repeating
amid
her
sobs
good
heavens
how
wretched
i
am
he
stood
perfectly
still
looking
at
her
for
several
seconds
and
then
went
quietly
away
she
left
all
alone
wept
on
in
the
silence
before
the
pins
scattered
over
the
and
the
floor
when
mouret
returned
to
the
little
he
found
vallagnosc
alone
the
baron
having
gone
back
to
the
ladies
as
he
still
felt
very
agitated
he
sat
down
at
the
further
end
of
the
apartment
on
a
sofa
and
his
friend
on
seeing
him
so
faint
charitably
came
and
stood
before
him
to
conceal
him
from
curious
eyes
at
first
they
looked
at
each
other
without
saying
a
word
then
vallagnosc
who
seemed
to
be
inwardly
amused
by
mouret
emotion
finished
by
asking
in
his
bantering
voice
are
you
enjoying
yourself
mouret
did
not
appear
to
understand
him
at
first
but
when
he
remembered
their
former
conversations
on
the
empty
stupidity
and
useless
torture
of
life
he
replied
of
course
i
never
before
lived
so
much
ah
my
boy
do
you
laugh
the
hours
that
make
one
die
of
grief
are
by
far
the
shortest
then
he
lowered
his
voice
and
continued
gaily
beneath
his
tears
yes
you
know
all
do
you
between
them
they
have
rent
my
heart
but
yet
the
wounds
they
make
are
nice
almost
as
nice
as
kisses
i
am
thoroughly
exhausted
but
no
matter
you
ca
think
how
i
love
life
oh
i
shall
win
her
at
last
that
little
girl
who
still
says
no
but
vallagnosc
once
more
trotted
out
his
pessimism
what
was
the
good
of
working
so
much
if
money
could
not
procure
everything
he
would
precious
soon
have
shut
up
shop
and
have
given
up
work
on
the
day
he
found
that
his
millions
could
not
even
win
him
the
woman
he
loved
mouret
as
he
listened
became
grave
but
all
at
once
he
protested
violently
believing
as
he
did
in
the
of
his
will
i
love
her
and
i
win
her
said
he
but
even
if
she
escapes
me
you
see
what
a
place
i
shall
build
to
cure
myself
it
will
be
splendid
all
the
same
you
do
understand
this
language
old
man
otherwise
you
would
know
that
action
contains
its
own
recompense
to
act
to
create
to
struggle
against
facts
to
overcome
them
or
be
overthrown
by
them
all
human
health
and
joy
consists
in
that
a
mere
way
of
diverting
one
self
murmured
the
other
well
i
prefer
diverting
myself
as
one
must
die
i
would
rather
die
of
passion
than
boredom
they
both
laughed
this
reminded
them
of
their
old
discussions
at
college
then
vallagnosc
in
an
effeminate
voice
began
to
parade
his
theories
of
the
insipidity
of
things
making
almost
a
boast
of
the
immobility
and
emptiness
of
his
existence
yes
he
would
be
as
bored
at
the
ministry
on
the
morrow
as
he
had
been
on
the
day
before
in
three
years
he
had
had
a
rise
of
six
hundred
francs
he
was
now
receiving
three
thousand
six
hundred
barely
enough
to
pay
for
his
cigars
things
were
getting
worse
than
ever
and
if
he
did
not
kill
himself
it
was
simply
from
idleness
and
a
dislike
of
trouble
on
mouret
speaking
of
his
marriage
with
mademoiselle
de
boves
he
replied
that
despite
the
obstinacy
of
the
aunt
in
refusing
to
die
the
matter
was
about
to
be
concluded
at
least
he
thought
so
the
parents
were
agreed
and
he
affected
to
have
no
will
of
his
own
what
was
the
use
of
wishing
or
not
wishing
since
things
never
turned
out
as
one
desired
and
as
an
example
of
this
he
mentioned
his
future
who
had
expected
to
find
in
madame
guibal
an
indolent
blonde
the
caprice
of
an
hour
but
was
now
led
by
her
with
a
whip
like
an
old
horse
on
its
last
legs
whilst
they
supposed
him
to
be
inspecting
the
stud
at
he
was
squandering
his
last
resources
with
her
in
a
little
house
at
versailles
he
happier
than
you
said
mouret
getting
up
oh
rather
declared
vallagnosc
perhaps
there
only
that
at
all
amusing
mouret
was
now
himself
again
he
was
thinking
about
getting
away
but
not
wishing
his
departure
to
resemble
a
flight
he
resolved
to
take
a
cup
of
tea
and
therefore
went
into
the
big
with
his
friend
both
of
them
in
high
spirits
when
the
ladies
inquired
if
the
mantle
had
been
made
to
fit
mouret
carelessly
replied
that
he
had
given
it
up
as
a
bad
job
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
at
this
the
others
seemed
astonished
and
whilst
madame
marty
hastened
to
serve
him
madame
de
boves
accused
the
shops
of
never
allowing
enough
material
for
their
garments
at
last
he
managed
to
sit
down
near
bouthemont
who
had
not
stirred
the
two
were
forgotten
for
a
moment
and
in
reply
to
the
anxious
questions
of
bouthemont
who
wished
to
know
what
he
had
to
expect
mouret
did
not
hesitate
any
longer
but
abruptly
informed
him
that
the
board
of
directors
had
decided
to
deprive
themselves
of
his
services
he
sipped
his
tea
between
each
sentence
he
uttered
protesting
all
the
while
that
he
was
in
despair
oh
a
quarrel
that
he
had
not
even
yet
got
over
for
he
had
left
the
meeting
beside
himself
with
rage
but
then
what
could
he
do
he
could
not
break
with
those
gentlemen
about
a
simple
staff
question
bouthemont
very
pale
had
to
thank
him
once
more
what
a
terrible
mantle
at
last
observed
madame
marty
henriette
ca
get
over
it
and
really
the
prolonged
absence
of
the
mistress
of
the
house
had
begun
to
make
every
one
feel
awkward
but
at
that
very
moment
madame
desforges
appeared
so
you
given
it
up
as
well
exclaimed
madame
de
boves
gaily
how
do
you
mean
why
monsieur
mouret
told
us
that
you
could
do
nothing
with
it
henriette
affected
the
greatest
surprise
monsieur
mouret
was
joking
said
she
the
mantle
will
fit
splendidly
she
appeared
very
calm
and
smiling
no
doubt
she
had
bathed
her
eyes
for
they
were
quite
fresh
without
the
slightest
trace
of
redness
whilst
her
whole
being
was
still
trembling
and
bleeding
she
managed
to
conceal
her
torment
beneath
a
mask
of
smiling
elegance
and
she
offered
some
sandwiches
to
vallagnosc
with
her
usual
graceful
smile
only
the
baron
who
knew
her
so
well
remarked
the
slight
contraction
of
her
lips
and
the
sombre
fire
which
she
had
not
been
able
to
extinguish
in
the
depths
of
her
eyes
he
guessed
the
whole
scene
dear
me
each
one
to
her
taste
said
madame
de
boves
also
accepting
a
sandwich
i
know
some
women
who
would
never
buy
a
ribbon
except
at
the
louvre
others
swear
by
the
bon
marché
it
a
question
of
temperament
no
doubt
the
bon
marché
is
very
provincial
murmured
madame
marty
and
one
gets
so
crushed
at
the
louvre
they
had
again
returned
to
the
big
establishments
mouret
had
to
give
his
opinion
he
came
up
to
them
and
affected
to
be
very
impartial
the
bon
marché
was
an
excellent
house
solid
and
respectable
but
the
louvre
certainly
had
a
more
showy
class
of
customers
in
short
you
prefer
the
ladies
paradise
said
the
baron
smiling
yes
replied
mouret
quietly
there
we
really
love
our
customers
all
the
women
present
were
of
his
opinion
it
was
indeed
just
that
at
the
ladies
paradise
they
found
themselves
as
at
a
sort
of
private
party
they
felt
a
continual
caress
of
flattery
an
overflowing
adoration
which
made
the
most
dignified
of
them
linger
there
the
vast
success
of
the
establishment
sprang
from
that
gallant
fascination
by
the
way
asked
henriette
who
wished
to
appear
entirely
at
her
ease
what
have
you
done
with
my
protégée
monsieur
mouret
you
know
mademoiselle
de
fontenailles
and
turning
towards
madame
marty
she
explained
a
marchioness
my
dear
a
poor
girl
fallen
into
poverty
oh
said
mouret
she
earns
three
francs
a
day
by
stitching
and
i
fancy
i
shall
be
able
to
marry
her
to
one
of
my
messengers
oh
fie
what
a
horror
exclaimed
madame
de
boves
he
looked
at
her
and
replied
in
his
calm
voice
why
so
madame
it
better
for
her
to
marry
an
honest
messenger
than
to
run
the
risk
of
being
picked
up
by
some
fellow
outside
vallagnosc
wished
to
interfere
for
the
sake
of
a
joke
do
push
him
too
far
madame
or
he
tell
you
that
all
the
old
families
of
france
ought
to
sell
calico
well
declared
mouret
it
would
at
least
be
an
honourable
end
for
a
great
many
of
them
they
set
up
a
laugh
the
paradox
seemed
far
fetched
but
he
continued
to
sing
the
praises
of
what
he
called
the
aristocracy
of
work
a
slight
flush
had
coloured
madame
de
boves
cheeks
she
was
wild
at
the
shifts
to
which
she
was
put
by
her
poverty
whilst
madame
marty
on
the
contrary
approved
what
was
said
stricken
with
remorse
on
thinking
of
her
poor
husband
just
then
the
footman
ushered
in
the
professor
who
had
called
to
take
her
home
in
his
thin
shiny
he
looked
more
shrivelled
than
ever
by
all
his
hard
toil
when
he
had
thanked
madame
desforges
for
having
spoken
for
him
at
the
ministry
he
cast
at
mouret
the
timid
glance
of
a
man
encountering
the
evil
that
is
to
kill
him
and
he
was
quite
confused
when
he
heard
the
other
ask
him
is
it
true
sir
that
work
leads
to
everything
work
and
thrift
replied
he
with
a
slight
shiver
of
his
whole
body
add
thrift
sir
meanwhile
bouthemont
had
not
moved
from
his
chair
mouret
words
were
still
ringing
in
his
ears
but
at
last
he
got
up
and
approaching
henriette
said
to
her
in
a
low
tone
do
you
know
he
given
me
notice
oh
in
the
kindest
possible
manner
but
may
i
be
hanged
if
he
sha
repent
it
i
just
found
my
sign
the
four
seasons
and
shall
plant
myself
close
to
the
opera
house
she
looked
at
him
with
a
gloomy
expression
reckon
on
me
i
with
you
wait
a
minute
she
said
and
forthwith
she
drew
baron
hartmann
into
the
recess
of
a
window
and
boldly
recommended
bouthemont
to
him
as
a
fellow
who
would
in
his
turn
revolutionize
paris
by
setting
up
for
himself
when
she
went
on
to
speak
of
an
advance
of
funds
for
her
new
protégé
the
baron
though
now
never
astonished
at
anything
could
not
restrain
a
gesture
of
bewilderment
this
was
the
fourth
fellow
of
genius
that
she
had
confided
to
him
and
he
was
beginning
to
feel
ridiculous
but
he
did
not
directly
refuse
the
idea
of
starting
a
competitor
to
the
paradise
even
pleased
him
somewhat
for
in
banking
matters
he
had
already
invented
this
sort
of
competition
to
keep
off
others
besides
the
adventure
amused
him
and
he
promised
to
look
into
the
matter
we
must
talk
it
over
whispered
henriette
on
returning
to
bouthemont
do
fail
to
call
about
nine
the
baron
is
with
us
at
this
moment
the
spacious
room
was
full
of
chatter
mouret
still
standing
in
the
midst
of
the
ladies
had
recovered
his
elegant
gracefulness
he
was
gaily
defending
himself
from
the
charge
of
ruining
them
in
dress
and
offering
to
prove
by
figures
that
he
enabled
them
to
save
thirty
per
cent
on
their
purchases
baron
hartmann
watched
him
seized
with
a
fraternal
admiration
come
the
duel
was
finished
henriette
was
decidedly
beaten
she
certainly
was
not
the
woman
who
was
to
avenge
all
the
others
and
he
fancied
he
could
again
see
the
modest
profile
of
the
girl
whom
he
had
observed
when
passing
through
the
she
stood
there
waiting
alone
redoubtable
in
her
sweetness
chapter
xii
it
was
on
the
of
september
that
the
building
of
the
new
façade
of
the
ladies
paradise
commenced
baron
hartmann
according
to
his
promise
had
managed
to
settle
the
matter
at
the
last
general
meeting
of
the
crédit
immobilier
and
mouret
was
at
length
approaching
the
realization
of
his
dream
this
façade
about
to
arise
in
the
rue
du
was
like
the
very
blossoming
of
his
fortune
he
therefore
desired
to
celebrate
the
laying
of
the
foundation
stone
and
made
it
a
ceremony
besides
distributing
gratuities
amongst
his
employees
and
giving
them
game
and
champagne
for
dinner
in
the
evening
every
one
noticed
his
wonderful
good
humour
during
the
ceremony
his
victorious
gesture
as
he
made
the
first
stone
fast
with
a
flourish
of
the
trowel
for
weeks
he
had
been
anxious
agitated
by
a
nervous
torment
that
he
did
not
always
manage
to
conceal
and
his
triumph
brought
a
respite
a
distraction
to
his
suffering
during
the
afternoon
he
seemed
to
have
returned
to
his
former
healthy
gaiety
but
at
when
he
went
through
the
refectory
to
drink
a
glass
of
champagne
with
his
staff
he
appeared
feverish
again
smiling
with
a
painful
look
his
features
drawn
by
the
unconfessed
suffering
which
was
consuming
him
he
was
once
more
mastered
by
it
the
next
day
in
the
cloak
and
mantle
department
clara
prunaire
tried
to
be
disagreeable
with
denise
she
had
noticed
lackadaisical
passion
and
took
it
into
her
head
to
joke
about
the
baudus
as
marguerite
was
sharpening
her
pencil
while
waiting
for
customers
she
said
to
her
in
a
loud
voice
you
know
my
admirer
opposite
it
really
grieves
me
to
see
him
in
that
dark
shop
which
no
one
ever
enters
he
not
so
badly
off
replied
marguerite
he
going
to
marry
the
governor
daughter
oh
oh
resumed
clara
it
would
be
good
fun
to
flirt
with
him
then
i
try
the
game
on
my
word
of
honour
and
she
continued
in
the
same
strain
happy
to
feel
that
denise
was
shocked
the
latter
forgave
her
everything
else
but
the
thought
of
her
dying
cousin
geneviève
being
finished
off
by
such
cruelty
exasperated
her
as
it
happened
at
that
moment
a
customer
came
in
and
as
madame
aurélie
had
just
gone
downstairs
she
took
the
direction
of
the
counter
and
called
clara
mademoiselle
prunaire
you
had
better
attend
to
this
lady
instead
of
gossiping
there
i
was
gossiping
have
the
kindness
to
hold
your
tongue
and
attend
to
this
lady
immediately
clara
gave
in
conquered
when
denise
showed
her
authority
without
raising
her
voice
not
one
of
them
resisted
she
had
acquired
this
absolute
authority
by
her
very
moderation
for
a
moment
she
walked
up
and
down
in
silence
amidst
the
young
ladies
who
had
become
serious
again
marguerite
had
resumed
sharpening
her
pencil
the
point
of
which
was
always
breaking
what
you
getting
angry
all
at
once
said
a
voice
behind
denise
it
was
pauline
on
her
way
across
the
department
she
had
noticed
the
scene
and
spoke
in
a
low
tone
smiling
but
i
obliged
to
replied
denise
in
the
same
tone
i
ca
manage
them
otherwise
pauline
shrugged
her
shoulders
nonsense
you
can
be
queen
over
all
of
us
whenever
you
like
she
replied
she
was
still
unable
to
understand
her
friend
refusal
since
the
end
of
august
pauline
had
been
married
to
baugé
a
most
stupid
affair
she
would
sometimes
gaily
remark
that
terrible
bourdoncle
treated
her
anyhow
now
considering
her
as
lost
for
trade
her
great
fear
was
that
they
might
some
fine
day
send
her
to
love
her
husband
elsewhere
for
the
managers
had
decreed
love
to
be
execrable
and
fatal
to
business
so
great
was
her
dread
that
when
she
met
baugé
in
the
galleries
she
often
affected
not
to
know
him
she
had
just
had
a
fright
old
jouve
having
nearly
caught
her
talking
to
her
husband
behind
a
pile
of
dusters
see
he
followed
me
she
added
after
hastily
relating
the
adventure
to
denise
just
look
at
him
sniffing
for
me
with
his
big
nose
jouve
in
fact
was
just
then
coming
from
the
lace
department
correctly
arrayed
in
a
white
tie
and
with
his
nose
on
the
scent
for
some
delinquent
but
when
he
saw
denise
his
face
relaxed
and
he
passed
by
with
an
amiable
smile
saved
murmured
pauline
my
dear
you
made
him
swallow
that
i
say
if
anything
should
happen
to
me
you
would
speak
for
me
would
you
yes
yes
do
put
on
that
astonished
air
we
know
that
a
word
from
you
would
revolutionize
the
house
and
thereupon
she
ran
off
to
her
counter
denise
had
blushed
troubled
by
these
friendly
allusions
it
was
true
however
she
had
a
vague
sensation
of
her
power
from
the
flattery
with
which
she
was
surrounded
when
madame
aurélie
returned
and
found
the
department
quiet
and
busy
under
the
surveillance
of
the
she
smiled
at
her
amicably
she
threw
over
mouret
himself
and
her
amiability
daily
increased
for
the
young
person
who
might
some
fine
morning
desire
her
situation
as
in
a
word
denise
reign
was
commencing
bourdoncle
alone
still
stood
out
in
the
secret
warfare
which
he
carried
on
against
the
young
girl
there
was
in
the
first
place
a
natural
antipathy
he
detested
her
for
her
gentleness
and
her
charm
then
too
he
fought
against
her
as
against
a
fatal
influence
which
would
place
the
house
in
peril
on
the
day
when
mouret
should
succumb
the
governor
commercial
genius
seemed
certain
to
founder
in
this
stupid
affection
all
that
they
had
gained
by
women
would
be
swallowed
up
by
this
one
none
of
them
touched
bourdoncle
heart
he
treated
them
all
with
the
disdain
of
a
passionless
man
whose
business
was
to
live
by
them
and
whose
last
illusions
had
been
dispelled
by
seeing
them
so
closely
amidst
the
worries
of
his
trade
and
what
made
him
especially
anxious
in
the
presence
of
this
little
saleswoman
who
had
gradually
become
so
redoubtable
was
that
he
did
not
in
the
least
believe
in
her
disinterestedness
in
the
genuineness
of
her
refusals
in
his
opinion
she
was
playing
a
part
the
most
skilful
of
parts
rendering
mouret
absolutely
mad
capable
of
any
folly
thus
bourdoncle
could
never
now
catch
sight
of
her
with
her
clear
eyes
sweet
face
and
simple
attitude
without
experiencing
a
real
fear
as
if
he
had
before
him
some
disguised
female
the
sombre
enigma
of
woman
death
in
the
guise
of
a
virgin
in
what
way
could
he
possibly
confound
the
tactics
of
this
spurious
novice
he
was
now
only
anxious
to
penetrate
her
artful
ways
in
the
hope
of
exposing
them
to
the
light
of
day
she
would
certainly
commit
some
fault
at
last
he
would
surprise
her
with
one
of
her
sweethearts
and
she
would
again
be
dismissed
the
house
would
then
resume
its
regular
working
like
a
machine
keep
a
good
monsieur
jouve
bourdoncle
kept
saying
to
the
inspector
i
take
care
that
you
shall
be
rewarded
but
jouve
was
somewhat
lukewarm
for
he
knew
something
about
women
and
asked
himself
whether
he
had
not
better
take
the
part
of
this
girl
who
might
be
the
sovereign
mistress
of
the
morrow
though
he
did
not
now
dare
to
touch
her
he
still
thought
her
bewitchingly
pretty
his
colonel
in
bygone
days
had
killed
himself
for
a
similar
little
thing
with
an
insignificant
face
delicate
and
modest
one
look
from
whom
had
ravaged
all
hearts
i
watching
he
replied
but
on
my
word
i
can
not
discover
anything
and
yet
stories
were
circulating
there
was
quite
a
current
of
abominable
running
beneath
the
flattery
and
respect
which
denise
felt
arising
around
her
the
whole
house
now
declared
that
she
had
formerly
had
hutin
for
a
sweetheart
and
they
were
suspected
of
still
meeting
from
time
to
time
deloche
also
was
said
to
keep
company
with
her
they
were
continually
meeting
in
dark
corners
and
talking
for
hours
together
it
was
quite
a
scandal
so
there
nothing
about
the
in
the
silk
department
or
about
the
young
man
in
the
lace
one
asked
bourdoncle
no
sir
nothing
yet
replied
the
inspector
it
was
with
deloche
especially
that
bourdoncle
expected
to
surprise
denise
for
one
morning
he
himself
had
caught
them
laughing
together
downstairs
in
the
meantime
he
treated
her
on
a
footing
of
perfect
equality
for
he
no
longer
disdained
her
feeling
that
she
was
strong
enough
to
overthrow
even
himself
notwithstanding
his
ten
service
should
he
lose
the
game
keep
your
eye
on
the
young
man
in
the
lace
department
he
concluded
each
time
they
are
always
together
if
you
catch
them
call
me
and
i
manage
the
rest
mouret
meanwhile
was
living
in
anguish
was
it
possible
that
such
a
child
could
torture
him
in
this
manner
he
could
always
recall
her
arrival
at
the
ladies
paradise
with
her
heavy
shoes
thin
black
dress
and
wild
look
she
stammered
they
all
used
to
laugh
at
her
he
himself
had
thought
her
ugly
at
first
ugly
and
now
she
could
have
brought
him
to
his
knees
by
a
look
for
he
thought
her
nothing
less
than
an
angel
then
she
had
remained
the
last
in
the
house
repulsed
joked
at
treated
by
him
as
a
curious
specimen
of
humanity
for
months
he
had
wanted
to
see
how
a
girl
sprung
up
and
had
amused
himself
with
this
experiment
not
understanding
that
he
was
risking
his
heart
she
little
by
little
had
grown
and
become
redoubtable
perhaps
he
had
loved
her
from
the
very
first
even
at
the
time
when
he
had
thought
that
he
felt
nothing
but
pity
for
her
and
yet
he
had
only
really
begun
to
feel
this
love
on
the
evening
of
their
walk
under
the
chestnut
trees
of
the
tuileries
his
life
dated
from
then
he
could
still
hear
the
laughter
of
a
group
of
little
girls
the
distant
fall
of
a
jet
of
water
whilst
in
the
warm
shade
she
walked
on
beside
him
in
silence
after
that
he
knew
no
more
his
fever
had
increased
hour
by
hour
all
his
blood
his
whole
being
in
fact
had
been
given
to
her
and
she
such
a
child
was
it
possible
when
she
passed
by
now
the
slight
gust
from
her
dress
seemed
to
him
so
powerful
that
he
staggered
for
a
long
time
he
had
struggled
and
even
now
he
frequently
became
indignant
and
endeavoured
to
free
himself
from
this
idiotic
possession
what
power
was
it
she
possessed
that
she
should
be
able
to
bind
him
in
this
way
had
he
not
seen
her
without
boots
to
her
feet
had
she
not
been
received
almost
out
of
charity
he
could
have
understood
had
it
been
a
question
of
one
of
those
superb
creatures
who
charm
the
multitude
but
this
little
girl
this
nobody
she
had
in
short
one
of
those
insignificant
faces
which
excite
no
remark
she
could
not
even
be
very
intelligent
for
he
remembered
her
bad
beginning
as
a
saleswoman
but
after
every
explosion
of
anger
he
experienced
a
relapse
of
passion
a
kind
of
sacred
terror
at
having
insulted
his
idol
she
possessed
everything
a
woman
can
have
that
is
good
courage
gaiety
simplicity
and
from
her
gentleness
a
charm
of
penetrating
subtlety
was
exhaled
one
might
at
first
ignore
her
or
elbow
her
like
any
other
girl
but
the
charm
soon
began
to
act
with
invincible
force
and
one
belonged
to
her
for
ever
if
she
deigned
to
smile
everything
then
beamed
in
her
white
face
her
soft
eyes
her
cheeks
and
chin
full
of
dimples
whilst
her
heavy
blonde
hair
also
seemed
to
light
up
with
a
royal
and
conquering
beauty
he
acknowledged
himself
vanquished
she
was
as
intelligent
as
she
was
beautiful
her
intelligence
came
from
the
best
part
of
her
being
whilst
in
his
eyes
the
other
saleswomen
only
possessed
a
superficial
education
the
varnish
which
scales
off
from
girls
of
that
class
she
without
any
false
elegance
retained
her
native
grace
the
savour
of
her
origin
the
broadest
commercial
ideas
sprang
up
from
her
experience
behind
her
narrow
forehead
whose
pure
lines
clearly
announced
the
presence
of
a
firm
will
and
love
of
order
and
he
could
have
clasped
his
hands
to
ask
her
pardon
for
blaspheming
in
his
hours
of
revolt
why
did
she
still
refuse
with
such
obstinacy
twenty
times
had
he
entreated
her
increasing
his
offers
offering
money
and
more
money
then
thinking
that
she
must
be
ambitious
he
had
promised
to
appoint
her
as
soon
as
there
should
be
a
vacancy
and
she
had
refused
and
still
refused
for
him
it
was
a
stupor
a
struggle
in
which
his
desire
became
rageful
all
his
days
were
now
spent
amidst
the
same
grievous
obsession
denise
image
rose
with
him
after
he
had
dreamed
of
her
all
night
she
followed
him
to
the
desk
in
his
office
where
he
signed
the
bills
and
orders
from
nine
to
ten
a
work
which
he
accomplished
mechanically
never
ceasing
to
feel
her
present
still
saying
no
with
her
quiet
air
then
at
ten
came
the
quite
a
cabinet
council
composed
of
the
twelve
directors
at
which
he
had
to
preside
they
discussed
matters
affecting
the
arrangements
examined
the
purchases
settled
the
window
displays
and
yet
she
was
still
there
he
heard
her
soft
voice
amidst
the
figures
he
saw
her
bright
smile
amidst
the
most
complicated
financial
situations
after
the
she
accompanied
him
on
the
daily
inspection
of
the
departments
and
returning
with
him
to
his
office
in
the
afternoon
she
remained
close
to
his
chair
from
two
till
four
whilst
he
received
a
crowd
of
important
business
men
the
principal
manufacturers
of
france
bankers
and
inventors
a
continual
of
the
wealth
and
intelligence
of
the
land
a
mad
dance
of
millions
rapid
interviews
during
which
the
biggest
affairs
of
the
paris
market
were
concluded
if
he
forgot
her
for
a
moment
whilst
he
was
deciding
to
ruin
or
support
an
industry
he
found
her
again
at
a
sudden
twitch
of
his
heart
his
voice
died
away
and
he
asked
himself
what
could
be
the
use
of
this
princely
fortune
since
she
still
refused
at
last
when
five
struck
he
had
to
sign
the
day
correspondence
and
the
mechanical
working
of
his
hand
began
again
whilst
she
rose
up
before
him
more
domineering
than
ever
seizing
him
entirely
to
hold
possession
of
him
throughout
the
solitary
and
ardent
hours
of
the
night
and
the
morrows
were
the
same
days
over
again
days
which
were
so
active
so
full
of
colossal
labour
but
which
the
slight
shadow
of
a
child
sufficed
to
ravage
with
anguish
however
it
was
particularly
during
his
daily
inspection
of
the
departments
that
he
felt
his
misery
to
have
built
up
this
giant
machine
to
reign
over
such
a
world
of
people
and
yet
to
be
dying
of
grief
because
a
little
girl
would
not
accept
him
he
scorned
himself
dragging
the
fever
and
shame
of
his
pain
about
with
him
everywhere
on
certain
days
he
became
disgusted
with
his
power
from
one
end
to
the
other
of
the
galleries
he
felt
nothing
but
nausea
at
other
times
he
would
have
wished
to
extend
his
empire
and
make
it
so
vast
that
she
would
perhaps
have
yielded
out
of
sheer
admiration
and
fear
he
would
begin
by
stopping
in
the
basement
opposite
the
shoot
this
was
still
in
the
rue
but
it
had
been
necessary
to
enlarge
it
and
it
was
now
as
wide
as
the
bed
of
a
river
down
which
the
continual
flood
of
goods
rolled
with
the
loud
noise
of
rushing
water
there
was
a
succession
of
arrivals
from
all
parts
of
the
world
rows
of
waggons
from
every
railway
a
ceaseless
unloading
a
stream
of
and
bales
flowing
underground
and
absorbed
by
the
insatiable
establishment
he
gazed
at
this
torrent
pouring
into
his
house
he
felt
that
he
was
one
of
the
masters
of
the
public
fortune
that
he
held
in
his
hands
the
fate
of
french
manufactures
and
yet
was
unable
to
buy
a
kiss
from
one
of
his
saleswomen
then
he
passed
on
to
the
receiving
department
which
now
occupied
that
part
of
the
basement
skirting
the
rue
monsigny
twenty
tables
were
ranged
there
in
the
pale
light
from
the
quite
a
crowd
of
assistants
was
bustling
about
emptying
cases
checking
goods
and
marking
them
in
plain
figures
amidst
the
neighbouring
roar
of
the
shoot
which
almost
drowned
their
voices
various
managers
of
departments
stopped
him
he
had
to
solve
difficulties
and
confirm
orders
the
cellar
filled
with
the
soft
glimmer
of
satin
and
the
whiteness
of
linen
a
prodigious
unpacking
in
which
furs
were
mingled
with
lace
french
fancy
goods
with
eastern
hangings
with
a
slow
step
he
wended
his
way
amidst
all
these
riches
thrown
about
in
disorder
heaped
up
in
their
rough
state
up
above
they
would
shine
in
the
window
displays
set
money
galloping
through
the
departments
no
sooner
shown
than
carried
off
in
the
furious
rush
of
business
which
traversed
the
place
but
he
kept
on
thinking
that
he
had
offered
denise
silks
and
velvets
anything
she
might
like
to
take
in
no
matter
what
quantity
from
among
these
enormous
heaps
and
that
she
had
refused
his
offer
by
a
slight
shake
of
her
fair
head
after
that
he
went
to
the
other
end
of
the
basement
to
pay
his
usual
visit
to
the
delivery
department
interminable
corridors
ran
along
lighted
by
gas
to
the
right
and
the
left
the
reserves
closed
in
with
gratings
seemed
like
so
many
subterranean
stores
a
complete
commercial
district
with
its
haberdashery
underclothing
glove
toy
and
other
shops
all
sleeping
in
the
gloom
further
on
stood
one
of
the
three
stoves
further
still
was
a
post
of
firemen
guarding
the
main
enclosed
in
its
iron
cage
he
found
in
the
delivery
department
the
sorting
tables
already
littered
with
heaps
of
parcels
and
cases
which
were
continually
arriving
in
large
hampers
and
campion
the
superintendent
gave
him
particulars
about
the
current
work
whilst
the
twenty
men
placed
under
his
orders
distributed
the
parcels
among
large
compartments
each
of
which
bore
the
name
of
a
district
of
paris
and
whence
the
messengers
took
them
up
to
the
vans
waiting
beside
the
foot
pavement
there
was
a
succession
of
cries
names
of
streets
and
other
instructions
were
shouted
out
quite
an
uproar
arose
all
the
bustle
of
a
about
to
leave
her
moorings
and
he
stood
there
for
a
moment
motionless
watching
this
emission
of
goods
which
he
had
just
seen
the
house
absorb
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
basement
the
huge
current
ended
here
it
was
here
that
it
discharged
itself
into
the
street
again
after
filling
the
tills
with
gold
but
his
eyes
became
dim
this
colossal
business
no
longer
had
any
importance
for
him
he
had
but
one
idea
that
of
going
away
to
some
distant
land
and
abandoning
everything
should
she
persist
in
saying
no
then
he
went
upstairs
continuing
his
inspection
talking
and
bestirring
himself
more
and
more
but
without
finding
any
respite
on
the
second
floor
he
entered
the
forwarding
department
seeking
quarrels
and
secretly
exasperated
with
the
perfect
regularity
of
the
machine
which
he
had
himself
built
up
this
department
was
the
one
that
was
daily
assuming
a
more
considerable
importance
it
now
occupied
two
hundred
employees
some
of
whom
opened
read
and
classified
the
letters
coming
from
the
provinces
and
abroad
whilst
others
collected
in
compartments
the
goods
ordered
by
customers
and
the
number
of
letters
was
increasing
to
such
an
extent
that
they
no
longer
counted
them
they
weighed
them
receiving
as
much
as
a
hundredweight
a
day
he
feverishly
went
through
the
three
offices
questioning
levasseur
the
chief
as
to
the
weight
of
the
correspondence
now
it
was
eighty
now
ninety
sometimes
on
a
monday
a
hundred
pounds
the
figure
increased
daily
he
ought
to
have
been
delighted
but
he
stood
quivering
amid
the
noise
made
by
a
neighbouring
squad
of
packers
nailing
down
the
cases
it
was
in
vain
that
he
roamed
about
the
building
his
fixed
idea
remained
fast
in
his
mind
and
as
his
power
unfolded
itself
before
him
as
the
mechanism
of
the
business
and
the
army
of
employees
passed
before
his
gaze
he
felt
more
deeply
than
ever
the
taunt
of
his
powerlessness
orders
from
all
europe
were
flowing
in
a
special
van
was
required
for
his
correspondence
and
yet
she
said
no
always
no
he
returned
downstairs
and
visited
the
central
cashier
office
where
four
clerks
guarded
the
two
giant
safes
through
which
million
francs
had
passed
during
the
previous
year
he
glanced
at
the
office
which
now
occupied
clerks
chosen
from
amongst
the
most
trustworthy
he
went
into
the
checking
office
where
young
men
junior
clerks
checked
the
and
calculated
the
salesmen
commissions
he
returned
to
the
chief
cashier
office
grew
exasperated
by
the
sight
of
the
safes
wandered
about
amidst
these
millions
the
uselessness
of
which
was
driving
him
mad
she
said
no
always
no
and
it
was
always
and
ever
no
in
all
the
departments
in
the
galleries
the
saloons
in
every
part
of
the
establishment
he
went
from
the
silk
to
the
drapery
department
from
the
linen
to
the
lace
he
ascended
to
the
upper
floors
pausing
on
the
hanging
bridges
prolonging
his
inspection
with
a
maniacal
grievous
minuteness
the
house
had
grown
and
spread
beyond
all
bounds
he
had
created
this
department
then
that
other
he
governed
that
fresh
domain
he
extended
his
empire
into
that
industry
the
last
one
conquered
and
it
was
no
always
no
in
spite
of
everything
his
staff
would
now
have
sufficed
to
people
a
small
town
there
were
fifteen
hundred
salesmen
and
a
thousand
other
employees
of
every
sort
including
forty
inspectors
and
seventy
cashiers
the
kitchens
alone
gave
occupation
to
men
ten
clerks
were
set
apart
for
the
advertising
service
there
were
three
hundred
and
fifty
shop
messengers
all
wearing
livery
and
firemen
living
on
the
premises
and
the
stables
royal
buildings
situated
in
the
rue
monsigny
opposite
the
warehouses
accommodated
one
hundred
and
horses
a
splendid
set
of
animals
already
celebrated
the
first
four
conveyances
which
had
stirred
up
the
whole
neighbourhood
formerly
when
the
house
occupied
only
the
corner
of
the
place
gaillon
had
gradually
increased
to
small
vans
and
heavy
ones
they
were
continually
scouring
paris
skilfully
driven
by
coachmen
clad
in
black
and
bearing
hither
and
thither
the
gold
and
purple
sign
of
the
ladies
paradise
they
even
went
beyond
the
fortifications
and
sped
through
the
suburbs
they
were
to
be
met
in
the
hollow
roads
of
bicêtre
and
along
the
banks
of
the
marne
along
even
the
shady
drives
of
the
forest
of
sometimes
one
would
emerge
from
the
depths
of
some
sunny
avenue
where
all
was
silent
and
deserted
the
superb
animals
which
drew
it
passing
by
at
a
trot
whilst
it
cast
the
glaring
advertisement
of
its
varnished
panels
upon
the
mysterious
peacefulness
of
nature
mouret
was
actually
thinking
of
sending
these
vehicles
further
still
even
into
the
neighbouring
departments
he
would
have
liked
to
hear
them
rolling
along
every
road
in
france
from
one
frontier
to
the
other
but
he
no
longer
even
crossed
the
street
to
visit
his
horses
though
he
was
passionately
fond
of
them
of
what
good
was
this
conquest
of
the
world
since
it
was
no
always
no
nowadays
of
an
evening
when
he
arrived
at
lhomme
desk
he
still
from
force
of
habit
glanced
at
the
amount
of
the
takings
written
on
a
card
which
the
cashier
stuck
up
on
an
iron
file
beside
him
this
figure
rarely
fell
below
a
hundred
thousand
francs
sometimes
on
big
sale
days
it
ran
up
to
eight
and
nine
hundred
thousand
but
the
amount
no
longer
sounded
in
mouret
ears
like
a
he
regretted
having
looked
at
it
and
bitterly
went
his
way
full
of
hatred
and
scorn
of
money
but
his
sufferings
were
destined
to
increase
for
he
became
jealous
one
morning
in
the
office
before
the
began
bourdoncle
ventured
to
hint
that
the
little
girl
in
the
mantle
department
was
playing
with
him
how
so
he
asked
turning
very
pale
why
yes
she
has
sweethearts
in
this
very
building
mouret
found
strength
to
smile
i
do
think
any
more
about
her
my
dear
fellow
you
can
speak
freely
who
are
they
hutin
they
say
and
then
a
salesman
in
the
lace
department
deloche
that
tall
awkward
fellow
i
ca
speak
with
certainty
never
having
seen
them
together
but
it
appears
that
it
notorious
there
was
a
silence
mouret
affected
to
arrange
the
papers
on
his
table
in
order
to
conceal
the
trembling
of
his
hands
at
last
he
observed
without
raising
his
head
one
must
have
proofs
try
and
bring
me
some
proofs
as
for
myself
i
assure
you
i
do
care
in
the
least
for
quite
sick
of
her
but
we
ca
allow
such
things
to
go
on
here
never
fear
replied
bouthemont
you
shall
have
proofs
one
of
these
days
i
keeping
a
good
this
news
deprived
mouret
of
all
rest
he
had
not
the
courage
to
revert
to
the
conversation
but
lived
in
continual
expectation
of
a
catastrophe
in
which
his
heart
would
be
crushed
and
this
torment
rendered
him
terrible
he
made
the
whole
house
tremble
he
now
disdained
to
conceal
himself
behind
bourdoncle
and
performed
the
executions
in
person
feeling
a
nervous
desire
for
revenge
solacing
himself
by
abuse
of
his
power
that
power
which
could
do
nothing
for
the
contentment
of
his
sole
desire
each
of
his
inspections
became
a
massacre
as
soon
as
he
was
seen
a
shudder
of
panic
sped
from
counter
to
counter
the
dead
winter
season
was
just
then
approaching
and
he
made
a
clean
sweep
in
each
department
piling
up
victims
and
hustling
them
into
the
street
his
first
idea
had
been
to
dismiss
hutin
and
deloche
but
he
had
reflected
that
if
he
did
not
keep
them
he
would
never
discover
anything
and
the
others
suffered
for
them
the
whole
staff
trembled
in
the
evening
when
he
found
himself
alone
again
tears
made
his
eyelids
swell
one
day
especially
terror
reigned
supreme
an
inspector
had
the
idea
that
mignot
was
stealing
there
was
always
a
number
of
girls
prowling
around
his
counter
and
one
of
them
had
lately
been
arrested
her
hips
and
bosom
padded
with
sixty
pairs
of
gloves
from
that
moment
a
watch
was
kept
and
the
inspector
caught
mignot
in
the
act
of
facilitating
the
sleight
of
hand
of
a
tall
fair
girl
who
had
formerly
been
a
saleswoman
at
the
louvre
his
plan
was
very
simple
he
pretended
to
be
trying
some
gloves
on
her
waited
till
she
had
padded
herself
and
then
conducted
her
to
the
where
she
paid
for
a
single
pair
only
mouret
happened
to
be
there
just
at
that
moment
as
a
rule
he
preferred
not
to
mix
himself
up
in
affairs
of
this
sort
which
were
fairly
frequent
for
notwithstanding
the
regular
working
great
disorder
reigned
in
certain
departments
of
the
ladies
paradise
and
scarcely
a
week
passed
by
without
some
employee
being
dismissed
for
theft
the
management
preferred
to
hush
up
such
matters
as
far
as
possible
considering
it
undesirable
to
set
the
police
at
work
and
thus
expose
one
of
the
fatal
of
these
great
bazaars
but
that
day
mouret
felt
a
real
need
of
venting
his
anger
on
some
one
and
treated
handsome
mignot
with
such
violence
that
the
latter
stood
there
trembling
with
fear
his
face
pale
and
distorted
i
ought
to
call
a
policeman
cried
mouret
before
all
the
other
salesmen
but
answer
me
who
is
this
woman
i
swear
i
send
for
the
police
commissary
if
you
do
tell
me
the
truth
the
woman
had
been
taken
away
and
two
saleswomen
were
searching
her
i
do
know
her
sir
mignot
stammered
out
she
the
one
who
came
do
tell
lies
interrupted
mouret
more
violently
still
and
there
nobody
here
to
warn
us
you
are
all
in
the
plot
on
my
word
we
are
robbed
pillaged
plundered
it
enough
to
make
us
have
the
pockets
of
each
one
searched
before
he
leaves
murmurs
were
heard
the
three
or
four
customers
buying
gloves
stood
looking
on
frightened
silence
he
resumed
furiously
or
i
clear
the
whole
place
however
bourdoncle
came
running
up
all
anxiety
at
the
idea
of
the
scandal
he
whispered
a
few
words
in
mouret
ear
the
affair
was
assuming
exceptional
gravity
and
he
prevailed
on
him
to
take
mignot
into
the
inspectors
office
a
room
on
the
near
the
entrance
in
the
rue
gaillon
the
woman
was
there
quietly
putting
on
her
things
again
she
had
just
mentioned
albert
lhomme
name
mignot
on
again
being
questioned
lost
his
head
and
began
to
sob
he
in
fault
it
was
albert
who
sent
him
these
girls
he
had
at
first
merely
afforded
them
certain
advantages
enabling
them
to
profit
by
the
bargains
and
at
last
when
they
took
to
stealing
he
was
already
too
far
compromised
to
report
the
matter
the
principals
now
discovered
a
series
of
extraordinary
robberies
goods
taken
away
by
girls
who
went
into
the
luxurious
lavatories
situated
near
the
refreshment
bar
and
surrounded
by
evergreen
plants
to
hide
them
under
their
skirts
purchases
which
a
salesman
neglected
to
call
out
at
a
when
he
accompanied
a
customer
there
and
the
price
of
which
he
divided
with
the
cashier
and
even
false
returns
articles
which
employees
said
had
been
brought
back
in
order
that
they
might
pocket
the
refunded
money
without
mentioning
the
common
robberies
of
things
which
the
salesmen
took
away
under
their
coats
in
the
evening
sometimes
rolled
round
their
bodies
and
sometimes
even
hung
down
their
legs
for
the
last
fourteen
months
thanks
to
mignot
and
other
salesmen
no
doubt
whom
they
refused
to
name
this
pilfering
had
been
going
on
at
desk
quite
an
impudent
trafficking
in
articles
representing
a
large
amount
of
money
which
was
never
correctly
ascertained
meanwhile
the
news
had
spread
through
the
various
departments
causing
guilty
consciences
to
tremble
whilst
the
most
honest
quaked
at
thought
of
the
general
sweep
that
seemed
imminent
albert
had
disappeared
into
the
inspector
office
next
his
father
had
passed
by
half
choking
his
face
red
and
showing
signs
of
apoplexy
then
madame
aurélie
herself
was
called
and
came
down
bearing
the
affront
with
head
erect
her
fat
puffy
countenance
having
the
appearance
of
a
wax
mask
the
explanation
lasted
for
some
time
no
one
knew
the
exact
details
but
it
was
said
that
the
had
slapped
her
son
face
whilst
the
worthy
old
father
wept
and
the
governor
contrary
to
all
his
elegant
habits
swore
like
a
trooper
absolutely
wanting
to
hand
the
offenders
over
to
justice
however
the
scandal
was
hushed
up
mignot
was
the
only
one
dismissed
there
and
then
albert
did
not
disappear
till
two
days
later
his
mother
had
doubtless
begged
that
the
family
might
not
be
dishonoured
by
an
immediate
execution
still
the
panic
lasted
several
days
longer
for
after
this
scene
mouret
wandered
from
one
end
of
the
establishment
to
the
other
with
a
terrible
expression
venting
his
anger
on
all
those
who
dared
even
to
raise
their
eyes
what
are
you
doing
there
sir
looking
at
the
flies
go
and
get
paid
at
last
the
storm
burst
one
day
on
the
head
of
hutin
himself
favier
now
appointed
second
was
undermining
the
in
order
to
dislodge
him
from
his
position
this
was
always
the
way
he
addressed
crafty
reports
to
the
directors
taking
advantage
of
every
opportunity
to
have
the
caught
doing
something
wrong
thus
one
morning
as
mouret
was
going
through
the
silk
department
he
stopped
short
quite
surprised
to
see
favier
altering
the
price
tickets
of
a
stock
of
black
velvet
why
are
you
lowering
the
prices
he
asked
who
gave
you
the
order
to
do
so
the
who
was
making
a
great
fuss
over
this
work
as
if
he
wished
to
attract
the
governor
attention
and
foresaw
the
result
replied
with
an
innocent
astonished
air
why
monsieur
hutin
told
me
sir
monsieur
hutin
where
is
monsieur
hutin
and
when
the
latter
came
up
from
the
receiving
department
where
a
salesman
had
been
sent
to
fetch
him
an
animated
explanation
ensued
what
he
undertook
to
lower
the
prices
of
his
own
accord
now
what
did
that
mean
but
in
his
turn
he
appeared
greatly
astonished
having
merely
talked
the
matter
over
with
favier
without
giving
any
positive
orders
the
latter
then
assumed
the
sorrowful
air
of
an
employee
who
finds
himself
obliged
to
contradict
his
superior
yet
he
was
quite
willing
to
accept
the
blame
if
it
would
get
the
latter
out
of
a
scrape
things
began
to
look
very
bad
understand
monsieur
hutin
cried
mouret
i
have
never
tolerated
these
attempts
at
independence
we
alone
decide
about
the
prices
he
went
on
speaking
in
a
sharp
voice
and
with
wounding
intentions
which
surprised
the
salesmen
for
as
a
rule
these
discussions
were
carried
on
quietly
and
the
affair
might
really
have
been
the
result
of
a
misunderstanding
one
could
divine
however
that
he
had
some
unavowed
spite
to
satisfy
he
had
at
last
caught
that
hutin
in
fault
that
hutin
who
was
said
to
be
denise
sweetheart
he
could
now
relieve
himself
by
making
the
other
feel
that
he
mouret
was
the
master
and
he
exaggerated
matters
even
insinuating
that
this
reduction
of
price
appeared
to
conceal
very
questionable
intentions
sir
repeated
hutin
i
meant
to
consult
you
about
it
it
is
really
necessary
as
you
know
for
there
has
been
no
demand
for
these
velvets
mouret
cut
him
short
with
a
final
harsh
remark
very
good
sir
we
will
look
into
the
matter
but
do
do
such
a
thing
again
if
you
value
your
situation
and
then
he
walked
off
hutin
bewildered
furious
finding
no
one
but
favier
to
confide
in
swore
that
he
would
go
and
throw
his
resignation
at
the
brute
head
but
he
soon
left
off
talking
of
leaving
and
began
to
stir
up
all
the
abominable
accusations
which
were
current
amongst
the
salesmen
against
their
chiefs
and
favier
his
eyes
sparkling
defended
himself
with
a
great
show
of
sympathy
he
was
obliged
to
reply
was
he
besides
could
any
one
have
foreseen
such
a
row
over
so
trifling
a
matter
what
had
come
on
the
governor
lately
that
he
should
be
so
unbearable
we
all
know
what
the
matter
with
him
replied
hutin
is
it
my
fault
if
that
little
jade
in
the
mantle
department
is
turning
his
head
my
dear
follow
you
can
see
that
the
blow
comes
from
there
aware
that
she
fancied
me
and
he
does
like
it
or
perhaps
it
she
herself
who
wants
to
get
me
dismissed
because
i
in
her
way
but
i
swear
she
shall
hear
from
me
if
ever
she
crosses
my
path
two
days
later
as
hutin
was
going
into
the
upstairs
under
the
leads
to
recommend
a
girl
of
his
acquaintance
he
started
on
perceiving
denise
and
deloche
leaning
against
a
window
at
the
end
of
a
passage
and
plunged
so
deeply
in
private
conversation
that
they
did
not
even
turn
round
the
idea
of
having
them
caught
there
suddenly
occurred
to
him
when
he
perceived
with
astonishment
that
deloche
was
weeping
he
at
once
went
off
without
making
any
noise
and
meeting
bourdoncle
and
jouve
on
the
stairs
told
them
some
story
about
one
of
the
the
door
of
which
seemed
to
have
been
torn
away
in
this
manner
they
would
go
upstairs
and
drop
on
to
the
two
others
bourdoncle
discovered
them
first
he
stopped
short
and
told
jouve
to
go
and
fetch
the
governor
whilst
he
remained
there
the
inspector
had
to
obey
though
greatly
annoyed
at
being
forced
to
mix
himself
up
in
such
a
matter
this
was
a
lost
corner
of
the
vast
world
where
the
people
of
the
ladies
paradise
bestirred
themselves
you
reached
it
by
an
intricate
network
of
stairs
and
passages
the
situated
in
the
attics
were
low
sloping
chambers
lighted
by
large
windows
cut
in
the
zinc
roofing
and
furnished
solely
with
long
tables
and
large
stoves
and
all
along
was
a
crowd
of
engaged
on
the
the
lace
the
upholstery
and
the
dressmaking
and
living
winter
and
summer
in
a
stifling
heat
amidst
the
odour
peculiar
to
the
business
you
had
to
skirt
all
these
rooms
and
turn
to
the
right
after
passing
the
dressmakers
before
coming
to
the
solitary
end
of
the
corridor
the
few
customers
whom
a
salesman
occasionally
brought
here
for
an
order
gasped
for
breath
tired
out
and
frightened
with
the
sensation
of
having
turned
round
and
round
for
hours
and
of
being
a
hundred
leagues
above
the
street
denise
had
often
found
deloche
waiting
for
her
as
she
had
charge
of
the
arrangements
between
her
department
and
the
where
only
the
models
and
alterations
were
attended
to
and
was
always
going
up
and
down
to
give
the
necessary
orders
the
young
man
would
watch
for
her
and
invent
any
pretext
to
run
after
her
and
then
affected
to
be
surprised
when
he
met
her
at
the
door
she
got
to
laugh
about
the
matter
and
it
became
quite
an
understood
thing
the
corridor
ran
alongside
one
of
the
cisterns
an
enormous
iron
tank
containing
twelve
thousand
gallons
of
water
and
on
the
roof
there
was
another
one
of
equal
size
reached
by
an
iron
ladder
for
an
instant
deloche
would
stand
talking
leaning
one
shoulder
against
the
cistern
in
the
continual
abandonment
of
his
long
body
bent
by
fatigue
a
noise
of
water
was
heard
a
mysterious
noise
the
musical
vibration
of
which
the
iron
tank
ever
retained
despite
the
solitude
denise
would
at
times
turn
round
anxiously
thinking
she
had
seen
a
shadow
pass
on
the
bare
pale
yellow
walls
but
the
window
would
soon
attract
them
they
would
lean
against
it
and
forget
themselves
in
a
pleasant
gossip
in
endless
souvenirs
of
their
native
place
below
them
extended
the
immense
glass
roof
of
the
central
gallery
a
lake
of
glass
bounded
by
the
distant
housetops
as
by
a
rocky
coast
beyond
they
saw
nothing
but
the
sky
a
sheet
of
sky
which
cast
in
the
sleeping
water
of
the
glass
work
a
reflection
of
the
flight
of
its
clouds
and
its
soft
azure
it
so
happened
that
deloche
was
that
day
speaking
of
valognes
i
was
six
years
old
my
mother
used
to
take
me
to
valognes
market
in
a
cart
he
said
you
know
it
ten
miles
away
we
had
to
leave
briquebec
at
five
it
a
fine
country
down
our
way
do
you
know
it
yes
yes
replied
denise
slowly
her
glances
wandering
far
away
i
was
there
once
but
was
very
little
then
roads
with
grass
on
each
side
eh
and
now
and
again
sheep
browsing
in
couples
dragging
their
clog
along
by
the
rope
she
stopped
then
resumed
with
a
vague
smile
our
roads
run
for
miles
as
straight
as
arrows
between
rows
of
trees
which
afford
some
shade
we
have
meadows
surrounded
by
hedges
taller
than
i
am
where
there
are
horses
and
cows
grazing
we
have
a
little
river
too
and
the
water
is
very
cold
under
the
brushwood
in
a
spot
i
well
know
it
is
the
same
with
us
exactly
cried
deloche
delighted
there
grass
everywhere
each
one
encloses
his
plot
with
thorns
and
elms
and
is
at
once
at
home
and
it
quite
green
a
green
far
different
to
what
we
see
in
paris
dear
me
how
i
played
in
the
hollow
road
on
the
left
coming
down
from
the
mill
their
voices
died
away
they
remained
with
their
eyes
fixed
lost
on
the
sunny
lake
of
the
glass
work
a
mirage
rose
up
before
them
from
that
blinding
water
they
beheld
an
endless
succession
of
meadows
the
cotentin
country
steeped
in
the
breath
of
the
ocean
bathed
in
a
luminous
vapour
which
blurred
the
horizon
with
the
delicate
grey
of
a
below
them
beneath
the
colossal
iron
framework
in
the
silk
hall
was
the
roar
of
business
the
trepidation
of
the
machine
at
work
the
entire
house
vibrated
with
the
tramping
of
the
crowd
the
bustle
of
the
salesmen
the
life
of
the
thirty
thousand
persons
hurtling
there
and
they
carried
away
by
their
dreams
thought
they
could
hear
the
wind
passing
over
the
grass
and
shaking
the
tall
trees
as
they
detected
this
deep
dull
clamour
with
which
the
roofs
were
resounding
ah
mademoiselle
denise
stammered
deloche
why
are
you
kinder
to
me
i
love
you
so
much
tears
had
come
into
his
eyes
and
as
she
signed
to
him
to
stop
he
continued
quickly
no
let
me
tell
you
these
things
once
more
we
should
get
on
so
well
together
people
always
find
something
to
talk
about
when
they
come
from
the
same
part
he
was
choking
and
she
was
at
last
able
to
say
kindly
not
reasonable
you
promised
me
never
to
speak
of
that
again
impossible
i
have
great
friendship
for
you
because
you
a
nice
fellow
but
i
wish
to
remain
free
yes
yes
i
know
he
replied
in
a
broken
voice
you
do
love
me
oh
you
may
say
so
i
quite
understand
it
there
nothing
in
me
to
make
you
love
me
listen
i
only
had
one
sweet
moment
in
my
life
and
that
was
when
i
met
you
at
joinville
do
you
remember
for
a
moment
under
the
trees
when
it
was
so
dark
i
thought
your
arm
trembled
and
was
stupid
enough
to
imagine
but
she
again
interrupted
him
her
quick
ear
had
just
detected
the
sound
of
bourdoncle
and
jouve
steps
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
hark
there
some
one
coming
no
said
he
preventing
her
from
leaving
the
window
it
in
the
cistern
all
sorts
of
extraordinary
noises
come
from
it
as
if
there
were
some
one
inside
and
then
he
continued
his
timid
caressing
complaints
she
was
no
longer
listening
to
him
however
rocked
into
a
dreamy
mood
by
his
declaration
of
love
her
eyes
wandering
over
the
roofs
of
the
ladies
paradise
to
the
right
and
the
left
of
the
large
glazed
gallery
other
galleries
and
other
halls
were
glistening
in
the
sunshine
between
the
housetops
pierced
with
garret
windows
and
running
along
symmetrically
like
the
wings
of
a
barracks
metal
ladders
and
bridges
rose
on
all
sides
describing
a
lacework
of
iron
in
the
air
whilst
the
kitchen
chimney
belched
forth
as
much
smoke
as
a
factory
and
the
great
square
cistern
supported
aloft
by
pillars
assumed
the
strange
silhouette
of
some
barbarous
structure
erected
at
this
height
by
the
pride
of
one
man
in
the
distance
paris
roared
when
denise
awoke
from
this
dreamy
contemplation
of
space
and
the
summits
of
the
ladies
paradise
where
her
thoughts
floated
as
in
a
vast
solitude
she
found
that
deloche
had
caught
hold
of
her
hand
and
as
he
appeared
so
she
did
not
draw
it
away
forgive
me
he
murmured
it
all
over
now
i
should
be
too
miserable
if
you
punished
me
by
withdrawing
your
friendship
i
assure
you
i
intended
to
say
something
else
yes
i
had
determined
to
understand
the
situation
and
be
very
good
then
his
tears
again
began
to
flow
and
he
tried
to
steady
his
voice
for
i
know
my
lot
in
life
it
is
too
late
for
my
luck
to
turn
beaten
at
home
beaten
in
paris
beaten
everywhere
i
now
been
here
four
years
and
am
still
the
last
in
the
department
so
i
wanted
to
tell
you
not
to
trouble
on
my
account
i
wo
annoy
you
any
more
try
to
be
happy
love
some
one
else
yes
that
would
really
be
a
pleasure
for
me
if
you
are
happy
i
shall
be
happy
too
that
will
be
my
happiness
he
could
say
no
more
as
if
to
seal
his
promise
he
raised
the
young
girl
hand
to
his
lips
kissing
it
with
the
humble
kiss
of
a
slave
she
was
deeply
affected
and
said
simply
in
a
tender
sisterly
tone
which
softened
somewhat
the
pity
of
the
words
my
poor
lad
but
they
started
and
turned
round
mouret
was
standing
before
them
for
the
last
ten
minutes
jouve
had
been
searching
all
over
the
place
for
the
governor
the
latter
however
was
looking
at
the
building
of
the
new
façade
in
the
rue
du
he
spent
long
hours
there
every
day
trying
to
interest
himself
in
this
work
of
which
he
had
so
long
dreamed
there
amidst
masons
laying
the
huge
and
engineers
setting
up
the
great
iron
framework
he
found
a
refuge
against
his
torments
the
façade
already
appeared
above
the
level
of
the
street
and
indications
of
the
spacious
porch
and
the
windows
of
the
first
storey
a
development
in
a
crude
state
could
be
seen
mouret
scaled
the
ladders
discussing
with
the
architect
the
ornamentation
which
was
to
be
something
quite
new
scrambled
over
the
heaps
of
brick
and
iron
and
even
went
down
into
the
cellars
and
the
roar
of
the
the
of
the
trowels
the
loud
noise
of
the
hammers
and
the
clamour
of
the
army
of
workmen
in
this
immense
cage
surrounded
by
planks
really
diverted
him
for
an
instant
he
would
come
out
white
with
plaster
black
with
his
feet
splashed
by
the
water
from
the
pumps
but
nevertheless
so
far
from
being
cured
that
his
anguish
returned
and
his
heart
beat
more
loudly
than
ever
as
the
uproar
of
the
works
died
away
behind
him
it
so
happened
on
the
day
in
question
that
a
slight
diversion
had
brought
back
his
gaiety
he
had
become
deeply
interested
in
an
album
of
drawings
of
the
mosaics
and
enamelled
which
were
to
decorate
the
friezes
when
jouve
out
of
breath
annoyed
at
being
obliged
to
soil
his
frock
coat
amongst
all
the
building
materials
came
up
to
fetch
him
at
first
mouret
cried
out
that
they
must
wait
but
at
a
word
spoken
in
an
undertone
by
the
inspector
he
immediately
followed
him
trembling
and
again
mastered
by
his
passion
nothing
else
existed
the
façade
crumbled
away
before
being
built
what
was
the
use
of
that
supreme
triumph
of
his
pride
if
the
mere
name
of
a
woman
whispered
in
his
ear
tortured
him
to
this
extent
upstairs
bourdoncle
and
jouve
thought
it
prudent
to
vanish
deloche
had
hastened
away
denise
paler
than
usual
alone
remained
face
to
face
with
mouret
looking
straight
into
his
eyes
have
the
goodness
to
follow
me
mademoiselle
he
said
in
a
harsh
voice
she
followed
him
they
descended
the
two
storeys
and
crossed
the
furniture
and
carpet
departments
without
saying
a
word
when
he
arrived
at
his
office
he
opened
the
door
wide
saying
walk
in
mademoiselle
and
closing
the
door
he
went
to
his
table
the
director
new
office
was
fitted
up
more
luxuriously
than
the
old
one
the
rep
hangings
had
been
replaced
by
velvet
ones
and
a
inlaid
with
ivory
occupied
one
whole
side
but
on
the
walls
there
was
still
no
other
picture
than
the
portrait
of
madame
hédouin
a
young
woman
with
a
calm
handsome
face
smiling
in
a
gilded
frame
mademoiselle
he
said
at
last
trying
to
maintain
a
cold
severe
air
there
are
certain
things
that
we
can
not
tolerate
good
conduct
is
absolutely
necessary
here
he
stopped
choosing
his
words
in
order
not
to
yield
to
the
furious
anger
which
was
rising
within
him
what
it
was
that
fellow
she
loved
that
wretched
salesman
the
of
his
counter
it
was
the
humblest
the
most
awkward
of
all
that
she
preferred
to
him
the
master
for
he
had
seen
them
she
leaving
her
hand
in
his
and
he
covering
that
hand
with
kisses
i
been
very
good
to
you
mademoiselle
continued
he
making
a
fresh
effort
i
little
expected
to
be
rewarded
in
this
way
denise
immediately
on
entering
had
been
attracted
by
madame
hédouin
portrait
and
notwithstanding
her
great
trouble
was
still
by
it
every
time
she
came
into
the
director
office
her
eyes
were
sure
to
meet
those
of
that
painted
lady
as
a
rule
she
was
almost
afraid
of
her
although
she
knew
her
to
have
been
very
good
this
time
however
she
felt
her
to
be
a
kind
of
protection
you
are
right
sir
she
said
softly
i
was
wrong
to
stop
and
talk
and
i
beg
your
pardon
for
doing
so
this
young
man
comes
from
my
own
part
of
the
country
i
dismiss
him
cried
mouret
putting
all
his
suffering
into
this
furious
cry
and
completely
overcome
entirely
forgetting
his
position
of
director
lecturing
a
saleswoman
guilty
of
an
infraction
of
the
regulations
he
broke
into
a
torrent
of
violent
words
had
she
no
shame
in
her
a
young
girl
like
her
to
fall
in
love
with
such
a
being
and
he
even
made
most
atrocious
accusations
introducing
hutin
name
and
the
names
of
others
into
the
affair
with
such
a
flood
of
words
that
she
could
not
even
defend
herself
but
he
would
make
a
clean
sweep
and
kick
them
all
out
the
explanation
he
had
resolved
on
when
following
jouve
had
degenerated
into
a
violent
scene
of
jealousy
yes
your
lovers
they
told
me
about
it
and
i
was
stupid
enough
to
doubt
it
but
i
was
the
only
one
who
did
i
was
the
only
one
choking
and
bewildered
denise
stood
listening
to
these
frightful
charges
which
she
had
not
at
first
understood
did
he
really
suppose
her
to
be
as
bad
as
that
at
another
remark
harsher
than
all
the
rest
she
silently
turned
towards
the
door
and
as
he
made
a
movement
to
stop
her
she
said
let
me
alone
sir
i
going
away
if
you
think
me
what
you
say
i
will
not
remain
in
the
house
another
second
but
he
rushed
in
front
of
the
door
exclaiming
why
do
you
defend
yourself
say
something
she
stood
there
very
stiff
maintaining
an
icy
silence
for
a
long
time
he
pressed
her
with
questions
with
a
growing
anxiety
and
the
mute
dignity
of
this
innocent
girl
once
more
seemed
to
be
the
artful
calculation
of
a
woman
learned
in
all
the
tactics
of
passion
had
she
desired
it
which
she
did
not
she
could
not
have
played
a
game
better
calculated
to
bring
him
to
her
feet
tortured
by
doubt
desirous
of
being
convinced
come
you
say
he
is
from
your
part
of
the
country
perhaps
you
met
there
formerly
swear
that
there
has
been
nothing
between
you
and
this
fellow
and
as
she
obstinately
remained
silent
as
if
still
wishing
to
open
the
door
and
go
away
he
completely
lost
his
head
and
gave
way
to
a
supreme
explosion
of
grief
good
heavens
i
love
you
i
love
you
why
do
you
delight
in
tormenting
me
like
this
you
can
see
that
nothing
else
exists
for
me
that
the
people
i
speak
about
only
touch
me
through
you
that
you
alone
can
occupy
my
thoughts
thinking
you
were
jealous
i
gave
up
all
my
pleasures
you
were
told
i
had
mistresses
well
i
have
them
no
longer
i
hardly
set
foot
outside
did
i
not
prefer
you
at
that
lady
house
have
i
not
quarrelled
with
her
in
order
to
belong
solely
to
you
and
i
am
still
waiting
for
a
word
of
thanks
a
little
gratitude
and
if
you
fear
that
i
should
return
to
her
you
may
feel
quite
easy
she
is
avenging
herself
by
helping
one
of
our
former
salesmen
to
found
a
rival
establishment
tell
me
must
i
go
on
my
knees
to
touch
your
heart
he
had
come
to
this
he
who
did
not
tolerate
the
slightest
peccadillo
among
the
shopwomen
who
turned
them
out
for
the
least
caprice
found
himself
reduced
to
imploring
one
of
them
not
to
go
away
not
to
abandon
him
in
his
misery
he
held
the
door
against
her
ready
to
forgive
her
everything
to
shut
his
eyes
if
she
merely
deigned
to
lie
and
he
spoke
the
truth
he
had
quite
reformed
he
had
long
since
given
up
clara
and
had
ceased
to
visit
at
madame
desforges
house
where
bouthemont
now
reigned
supreme
pending
the
opening
of
the
new
establishment
the
four
seasons
which
was
already
filling
the
newspapers
with
its
advertisements
tell
me
must
i
go
on
my
knees
he
repeated
almost
choked
by
suppressed
tears
she
signed
to
him
to
cease
speaking
herself
quite
unable
to
conceal
her
emotion
deeply
affected
by
his
suffering
passion
you
are
wrong
sir
to
agitate
yourself
in
this
way
she
at
last
replied
i
assure
you
that
all
these
wicked
reports
are
untrue
that
poor
fellow
you
saw
just
now
is
no
more
guilty
than
i
am
she
said
this
with
her
brave
frank
air
looking
with
her
bright
eyes
straight
into
his
face
very
good
i
believe
you
he
murmured
i
not
dismiss
any
of
your
comrades
since
you
take
all
these
people
under
your
protection
but
why
then
do
you
repulse
me
if
you
love
no
one
else
a
sudden
constraint
an
anxious
bashfulness
came
upon
the
young
girl
you
love
some
one
do
you
not
he
resumed
in
a
trembling
voice
oh
you
may
speak
out
i
have
no
claim
on
your
affections
do
you
love
any
one
she
turned
very
red
her
heart
was
in
her
mouth
and
she
felt
all
falsehood
impossible
in
the
presence
of
the
emotion
which
was
betraying
her
the
repugnance
for
lying
which
made
the
truth
appear
in
her
face
in
spite
of
all
yes
she
at
last
confessed
feebly
but
i
beg
you
to
let
me
go
sir
you
are
torturing
me
she
was
now
suffering
in
her
turn
was
it
not
enough
to
have
to
defend
herself
against
him
must
she
even
fight
against
herself
against
the
gust
of
tenderness
which
sometimes
took
away
all
her
courage
when
he
spoke
to
her
like
this
when
she
saw
him
such
a
prey
to
emotion
so
overcome
she
hardly
knew
why
she
still
refused
and
it
was
only
afterwards
that
in
the
depths
of
her
healthy
girlish
nature
she
found
the
pride
and
prudence
which
maintained
her
intact
in
her
virtuous
resolutions
mouret
gave
way
to
a
gesture
of
gloomy
discouragement
he
could
not
understand
her
he
turned
towards
his
table
took
up
some
papers
and
then
at
once
laid
them
down
again
saying
i
will
detain
you
no
longer
mademoiselle
i
can
not
keep
you
against
your
will
but
i
do
wish
to
go
away
replied
she
smiling
if
you
believe
me
to
be
innocent
i
will
remain
one
ought
always
to
believe
a
woman
to
be
virtuous
sir
there
are
numbers
who
are
so
i
assure
you
denise
had
involuntarily
raised
her
eyes
towards
madame
portrait
that
lady
so
sensible
and
so
beautiful
whose
blood
they
said
had
brought
good
fortune
to
the
house
mouret
followed
the
glance
with
a
start
for
he
thought
he
could
hear
his
dead
wife
pronounce
that
phrase
one
of
her
own
sayings
which
he
recognised
and
it
was
like
a
resurrection
he
discovered
in
denise
the
good
sense
the
mental
equilibrium
of
her
whom
he
had
lost
even
down
to
her
gentle
voice
sparing
of
useless
words
he
was
struck
by
the
resemblance
and
it
rendered
him
sadder
still
you
know
i
am
yours
he
murmured
in
conclusion
do
what
you
like
with
me
then
she
resumed
gaily
that
is
right
sir
the
advice
of
a
woman
however
humble
she
may
be
is
always
worth
listening
to
when
she
has
a
little
intelligence
if
you
put
yourself
in
my
hands
you
may
be
sure
i
make
nothing
but
a
good
man
of
you
she
smiled
with
that
simple
unassuming
air
which
possessed
such
a
charm
he
also
smiled
in
a
feeble
way
and
escorted
her
as
far
as
the
door
as
he
might
have
done
with
a
lady
the
next
day
denise
was
appointed
the
dress
and
costume
department
was
divided
the
management
creating
especially
for
her
benefit
a
children
costume
department
which
was
installed
near
that
of
the
cloaks
and
mantles
ever
since
her
son
dismissal
madame
aurélie
had
been
trembling
for
she
found
the
directors
cooling
towards
her
and
also
observed
the
young
woman
power
increasing
daily
would
they
not
shortly
take
advantage
of
some
pretext
or
other
and
sacrifice
her
in
favour
of
denise
her
imperial
countenance
puffed
up
with
fat
seemed
to
have
grown
thinner
from
the
shame
which
now
stained
the
lhomme
dynasty
and
she
made
a
show
of
going
away
every
evening
on
her
husband
arm
for
they
had
been
brought
nearer
together
by
misfortune
and
vaguely
felt
that
the
evil
came
from
the
disorder
of
their
home
whilst
the
poor
old
man
more
affected
than
her
a
prey
as
he
was
to
a
sickly
fear
that
he
might
himself
be
suspected
of
robbery
would
count
the
receipts
twice
over
with
a
great
deal
of
noise
performing
miracles
the
while
with
his
injured
arm
accordingly
when
madame
aurélie
saw
denise
appointed
of
the
children
costume
department
she
experienced
such
delight
that
she
paraded
the
most
affectionate
feeling
towards
her
being
indeed
really
grateful
to
her
for
not
having
taken
her
own
place
and
so
she
overwhelmed
her
with
attentions
treating
her
as
an
equal
often
going
to
talk
to
her
in
the
neighbouring
department
with
a
stately
air
like
a
paying
a
visit
to
a
young
queen
in
fact
denise
was
now
at
the
summit
her
appointment
as
had
destroyed
the
last
resistance
if
some
still
babbled
from
that
itching
of
the
tongue
which
infects
every
assemblage
of
men
and
women
all
nevertheless
bowed
very
low
before
her
face
marguerite
now
was
full
of
praise
for
her
clara
herself
inspired
with
a
secret
respect
for
this
good
fortune
which
she
felt
herself
incapable
of
achieving
bowed
her
head
but
denise
victory
was
still
more
complete
over
the
gentlemen
over
jouve
who
now
almost
bent
double
whenever
he
addressed
her
over
hutin
seized
with
anxiety
on
feeling
his
position
giving
way
under
him
and
over
bourdoncle
at
last
reduced
to
powerlessness
when
the
latter
saw
her
come
out
of
the
director
office
smiling
with
her
quiet
air
and
when
on
the
morrow
mouret
had
insisted
on
the
board
creating
the
new
department
he
had
yielded
vanquished
by
his
terror
of
woman
he
had
always
thus
given
in
to
mouret
recognising
him
to
be
the
master
notwithstanding
his
escapades
and
idiotic
love
affairs
this
time
the
woman
had
proved
the
stronger
and
he
was
expecting
to
be
swept
away
by
the
disaster
yet
denise
bore
her
triumph
in
a
quiet
charming
manner
touched
by
these
marks
of
consideration
and
desirous
of
interpreting
them
as
sympathy
for
the
miseries
of
her
and
the
final
success
of
her
patient
courage
thus
it
was
with
laughing
joy
that
she
received
the
slightest
tokens
of
friendship
and
this
caused
her
to
be
really
loved
by
some
she
was
so
kind
sympathetic
and
full
of
affection
the
only
person
for
whom
she
still
showed
an
invincible
repugnance
was
clara
for
she
had
learned
that
this
girl
had
amused
herself
by
leading
colomban
astray
even
as
she
had
said
she
would
do
for
a
joke
and
he
carried
away
by
his
passion
was
now
becoming
more
dissipated
every
day
whilst
poor
geneviève
was
slowly
dying
the
affair
was
talked
of
at
the
ladies
paradise
and
thought
very
droll
there
but
this
trouble
the
only
one
she
had
outside
did
not
in
any
way
change
denise
equable
temper
it
was
especially
in
her
department
that
she
was
seen
at
her
best
in
the
midst
of
her
little
world
of
babies
of
all
ages
she
was
passionately
fond
of
children
and
could
not
have
been
placed
in
a
better
position
sometimes
there
were
fully
fifty
little
girls
and
as
many
boys
there
quite
a
turbulent
school
all
agog
with
the
desires
of
budding
coquetry
the
mothers
completely
lost
their
heads
she
conciliatory
and
smiling
had
the
little
ones
placed
in
a
row
on
chairs
and
when
among
the
number
there
happened
to
be
a
little
angel
whose
pretty
face
tempted
her
she
would
insist
on
serving
her
herself
bringing
the
dress
and
trying
it
on
the
child
dimpled
shoulders
with
the
tender
precaution
of
an
elder
sister
bursts
of
clear
laughter
rang
out
faint
cries
of
ecstasy
were
raised
amidst
the
scolding
voices
of
the
mothers
sometimes
a
little
girl
nine
or
ten
years
old
already
a
grand
lady
in
her
own
estimation
would
when
trying
on
a
cloth
jacket
stand
studying
it
before
a
glass
now
and
again
turning
round
with
an
absorbed
air
while
her
eyes
sparkled
with
the
desire
to
please
the
counters
were
littered
with
unpacked
goods
dresses
in
pink
and
blue
eastern
cotton
for
children
of
from
one
to
five
years
old
sailor
costumes
in
blue
zephyr
with
plaited
skirts
and
blouses
trimmed
with
cambric
louis
xv
costumes
mantles
jackets
a
medley
of
little
garments
stiff
in
their
infantile
grace
something
like
the
contents
of
the
of
a
band
of
big
dolls
taken
out
of
the
wardrobes
and
given
over
to
pillage
denise
always
had
a
few
sweets
in
her
pockets
to
appease
the
tears
of
some
youngster
in
despair
at
not
being
able
to
carry
off
a
pair
of
red
breeches
and
she
lived
there
amongst
these
little
ones
as
in
her
own
family
feeling
quite
young
again
herself
from
the
contact
of
all
the
innocence
and
freshness
incessantly
renewed
around
her
skirts
she
now
at
times
had
long
friendly
talks
with
mouret
whenever
she
went
to
the
office
to
take
orders
or
furnish
information
he
would
keep
her
chatting
enjoying
the
sound
of
her
voice
it
was
what
she
laughingly
called
making
a
good
man
of
him
in
her
prudent
cautious
norman
brain
there
sprang
up
all
sorts
of
projects
ideas
about
the
new
style
of
business
at
which
she
had
already
ventured
to
hint
when
at
robineau
and
some
of
which
she
had
expressed
on
the
evening
of
their
charming
walk
in
the
tuileries
gardens
she
could
not
be
occupied
in
any
matter
or
see
any
work
going
on
without
being
moved
by
a
desire
to
introduce
some
improvement
into
the
mechanism
thus
since
her
entry
into
the
ladies
paradise
she
had
been
particularly
pained
by
the
precarious
position
of
the
employees
the
sudden
dismissals
shocked
her
she
thought
them
iniquitous
and
stupid
hurtful
to
all
to
the
house
as
much
as
the
staff
her
former
sufferings
were
still
fresh
in
her
mind
and
her
heart
filled
with
pity
every
time
she
saw
a
with
feet
bruised
and
eyes
dim
with
tears
dragging
her
misery
along
in
her
silk
dress
amidst
the
spiteful
persecution
of
the
older
hands
this
dog
life
made
the
best
of
them
bad
and
the
sad
work
of
destruction
commenced
they
were
all
devoured
by
the
business
before
the
age
of
forty
often
disappearing
falling
into
unknown
depths
a
great
many
dying
in
harness
some
of
consumption
and
exhaustion
others
of
fatigue
and
bad
air
whilst
a
few
were
thrown
on
the
street
and
the
happiest
married
and
buried
themselves
in
some
little
provincial
shop
was
this
frightful
consumption
of
human
life
for
which
the
big
shops
were
responsible
every
year
right
and
just
and
she
pleaded
the
cause
of
the
colossal
machine
gearing
not
from
sentimental
reasons
but
by
arguments
appealing
to
the
very
interests
of
the
employers
to
make
a
machine
solid
and
strong
it
is
necessary
to
use
good
iron
if
the
iron
breaks
or
is
broken
a
stoppage
of
work
repeated
expenses
of
restarting
quite
a
loss
of
power
ensue
sometimes
she
would
become
quite
animated
and
picture
an
immense
ideal
bazaar
the
phalansterium
of
modern
commerce
in
which
each
would
secure
his
exact
share
of
profits
according
to
his
merits
with
a
certainty
of
the
future
assured
to
him
by
contract
mouret
would
make
merry
over
this
notwithstanding
his
fever
he
accused
her
of
socialism
embarrassed
her
by
pointing
out
the
difficulties
of
carrying
out
these
schemes
for
she
spoke
in
the
simplicity
of
her
soul
bravely
trusting
in
the
future
whenever
she
perceived
a
dangerous
gap
underlying
her
plans
nevertheless
he
was
shaken
captivated
by
her
young
voice
which
still
quivered
at
the
thought
of
the
hardships
she
had
undergone
and
was
so
instinct
with
earnestness
as
she
pointed
out
reforms
which
would
tend
to
consolidate
the
house
and
even
while
joking
with
her
he
listened
thus
the
salesmen
positions
were
gradually
improved
the
wholesale
dismissals
were
replaced
by
a
system
of
holidays
granted
during
the
dead
seasons
and
it
was
decided
to
found
a
sort
of
benefit
club
which
would
protect
the
employees
against
slack
times
and
ensure
them
a
pension
it
was
the
embryo
of
the
vast
trades
unions
of
the
twentieth
century
moreover
denise
did
not
confine
her
attention
solely
to
the
healing
of
the
wounds
from
which
she
had
herself
bled
she
conceived
various
delicate
feminine
ideas
with
which
she
prompted
mouret
and
which
delighted
the
customers
she
also
made
lhomme
happy
by
supporting
a
scheme
he
had
long
entertained
that
of
creating
a
band
of
musicians
of
which
all
the
members
should
be
chosen
from
amongst
the
staff
three
months
later
lhomme
had
a
hundred
and
twenty
musicians
under
his
direction
and
the
dream
of
his
whole
life
was
realized
and
a
grand
fête
was
then
given
on
the
premises
a
concert
and
a
ball
to
introduce
the
band
of
the
ladies
paradise
to
the
customers
and
the
whole
world
the
newspapers
took
the
matter
up
bourdoncle
himself
though
staggered
by
these
innovations
was
obliged
to
bow
before
the
immense
advertisement
afterwards
came
the
establishment
of
a
recreation
room
for
the
men
with
two
billiard
tables
and
backgammon
and
chess
boards
then
classes
were
held
in
the
house
of
an
evening
lessons
were
given
in
english
and
german
in
grammar
arithmetic
and
geography
at
last
too
there
were
even
riding
and
fencing
lessons
a
library
was
also
formed
ten
thousand
volumes
were
placed
at
the
disposal
of
the
employees
and
afterwards
came
a
resident
doctor
giving
consultations
gratis
together
with
baths
and
and
refreshment
saloons
every
want
of
life
was
provided
for
everything
board
lodging
clothing
and
education
was
to
be
obtained
without
going
out
of
doors
there
in
the
very
heart
of
paris
now
all
agog
with
the
clatter
of
this
working
city
which
was
springing
up
so
vigorously
amidst
the
ruins
of
the
olden
streets
at
last
opened
to
the
sunshine
the
paradise
sufficed
entirely
for
all
its
own
wants
and
pleasures
then
a
further
change
of
opinion
took
place
in
denise
favour
as
bourdoncle
vanquished
repeated
with
despair
to
his
friends
that
he
would
himself
give
a
great
deal
to
prevail
upon
denise
to
accept
mouret
it
was
concluded
that
she
still
refused
to
do
so
and
that
her
resulted
from
her
refusal
from
that
moment
she
became
popular
they
knew
for
what
indulgences
they
were
indebted
to
her
and
they
admired
her
for
the
strength
of
her
will
there
at
all
events
was
one
who
could
master
the
governor
who
avenged
all
the
others
and
knew
how
to
get
something
more
than
promises
out
of
him
so
she
had
come
at
last
she
who
caused
him
to
treat
the
poor
and
humble
with
a
little
consideration
when
she
passed
through
the
departments
with
her
delicate
head
her
gentle
invincible
air
the
salesmen
smiled
at
her
felt
proud
of
her
and
would
willingly
have
exhibited
her
to
the
crowd
she
in
her
happiness
allowed
herself
to
be
carried
along
by
this
increasing
sympathy
but
was
it
all
possible
she
again
saw
herself
arriving
in
a
shabby
dress
frightened
lost
amidst
the
mechanism
of
the
terrible
machine
for
a
long
time
she
had
felt
she
was
nothing
barely
a
grain
of
millet
beneath
the
millstones
which
were
crushing
a
whole
world
and
now
she
was
the
very
soul
of
this
world
she
alone
was
of
any
consequence
able
at
a
word
to
increase
or
slacken
the
pace
of
the
colossus
lying
at
her
feet
and
yet
she
had
not
wished
for
these
things
she
had
simply
presented
herself
without
calculation
possessed
of
naught
but
the
charm
of
her
sweetness
her
sovereignty
sometimes
caused
her
an
uneasy
surprise
why
did
they
all
obey
her
she
was
not
pretty
she
did
nothing
wrong
then
she
smiled
her
heart
at
rest
feeling
within
herself
naught
but
goodness
and
prudence
a
love
of
truth
and
logic
which
constituted
all
her
strength
one
of
denise
greatest
joys
at
this
time
was
to
be
able
to
assist
pauline
the
latter
now
about
to
become
a
mother
was
trembling
for
she
knew
that
two
other
saleswomen
similarly
circumstanced
had
been
sent
away
the
principals
did
not
tolerate
maternity
they
occasionally
allowed
marriage
but
would
admit
of
no
children
pauline
it
was
true
had
her
husband
in
the
house
but
still
she
felt
anxious
and
in
order
to
postpone
a
probable
dismissal
sought
to
conceal
her
state
as
long
as
she
could
but
bourdoncle
had
observed
that
her
complexion
was
getting
very
pale
and
one
morning
while
he
was
standing
near
her
in
the
department
a
messenger
taking
away
a
bundle
ran
against
her
with
such
force
that
she
cried
out
with
pain
bourdoncle
immediately
took
her
on
one
side
made
her
confess
and
submitted
the
question
of
her
dismissal
to
the
board
under
the
pretext
that
she
was
in
need
of
country
air
mouret
who
was
not
at
the
meeting
could
only
give
his
opinion
in
the
evening
but
denise
having
had
time
to
interpose
he
closed
bourdoncle
mouth
in
the
interests
of
the
establishment
itself
did
they
wish
to
wound
the
feelings
of
all
the
mothers
and
young
married
women
amongst
their
customers
and
so
it
was
decided
with
great
solemnity
that
every
married
saleswoman
should
whenever
necessary
be
sent
to
a
special
midwife
at
the
expense
the
next
day
when
denise
went
up
to
the
infirmary
to
see
pauline
who
had
been
obliged
to
take
to
her
bed
on
account
of
the
blow
she
had
received
the
latter
kissed
her
heartily
on
both
cheeks
how
kind
you
are
had
it
not
been
for
you
i
should
have
been
turned
away
pray
be
anxious
about
me
the
doctor
says
it
nothing
baugé
who
had
slipped
away
from
his
department
was
also
there
on
the
other
side
of
the
bed
he
likewise
stammered
his
thanks
disturbed
in
the
presence
of
denise
whom
he
now
treated
as
an
important
person
of
a
superior
class
ah
if
he
heard
any
more
unkind
remarks
about
her
he
would
soon
close
the
mouths
of
the
jealous
ones
but
pauline
sent
him
away
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
my
poor
dear
you
always
saying
something
stupid
leave
us
to
talk
together
the
infirmary
was
a
long
light
room
containing
twelve
beds
with
white
curtains
those
who
did
not
wish
to
go
home
to
their
families
were
nursed
there
however
on
the
day
in
question
pauline
was
the
only
occupant
her
bed
was
near
one
of
the
large
windows
which
looked
on
to
the
rue
and
amidst
the
white
hangings
in
the
calm
atmosphere
perfumed
with
a
faint
odour
of
lavender
they
immediately
began
to
exchange
confidences
in
soft
affectionate
whispers
so
he
does
just
what
you
wish
him
to
all
the
same
said
pauline
how
cruel
you
are
to
make
him
suffer
so
come
just
explain
it
to
me
now
that
i
ventured
to
approach
the
subject
do
you
detest
him
pauline
had
retained
hold
of
denise
hand
as
the
latter
sat
near
the
bed
with
her
elbow
resting
on
the
bolster
and
denise
was
overcome
by
sudden
emotion
her
cheeks
flushed
red
and
in
a
momentary
weakness
her
secret
escaped
her
at
this
direct
and
unexpected
question
i
love
him
she
murmured
burying
her
head
in
the
pillow
pauline
was
astonished
what
you
love
him
and
after
a
pause
she
asked
so
it
all
to
make
him
marry
you
but
at
this
the
young
girl
sprang
up
quite
confused
marry
me
oh
no
oh
i
assure
you
that
i
have
never
wished
for
anything
of
the
kind
no
never
has
such
an
idea
entered
my
head
and
you
know
what
a
horror
i
have
of
all
falsehood
well
dear
resumed
pauline
kindly
you
could
have
acted
otherwise
if
such
had
been
your
intention
all
this
must
come
to
an
end
and
it
is
very
certain
that
it
can
only
finish
by
a
marriage
so
far
as
you
are
concerned
i
must
tell
you
that
everybody
here
has
the
same
idea
yes
they
are
convinced
that
you
are
riding
the
high
horse
in
order
to
make
him
take
you
to
church
dear
me
what
a
funny
girl
you
are
and
then
she
had
to
console
denise
who
had
again
sunk
down
with
her
head
on
the
bolster
sobbing
and
declaring
that
she
would
certainly
go
away
since
they
attributed
to
her
all
sorts
of
things
that
had
never
even
crossed
her
mind
no
doubt
when
a
man
loved
a
woman
he
ought
to
marry
her
but
she
asked
for
nothing
she
had
made
no
calculations
she
simply
begged
that
she
might
be
allowed
to
live
quietly
with
her
joys
and
sorrows
like
other
people
yes
she
would
go
away
at
the
same
moment
mouret
was
crossing
the
premises
below
seeking
to
forget
his
thoughts
by
visiting
the
works
once
more
several
months
had
elapsed
the
façade
now
reared
its
monumental
proportions
behind
the
vast
hoarding
which
concealed
it
from
the
public
quite
an
army
of
decorators
and
others
were
at
work
the
central
group
above
the
door
was
being
gilded
whilst
the
pedestals
destined
to
support
statues
of
the
manufacturing
cities
of
france
were
being
fixed
on
the
acroteria
along
the
rue
du
lately
opened
to
the
public
a
crowd
of
idlers
now
stood
from
morning
till
night
looking
up
seeing
nothing
but
nevertheless
interested
in
the
marvels
related
of
this
façade
the
inauguration
of
which
was
expected
to
revolutionize
paris
and
it
was
beside
this
new
building
full
of
the
fever
of
work
amidst
the
artists
putting
the
finishing
touches
to
the
realization
of
his
dream
as
commenced
by
the
masons
that
mouret
more
bitterly
than
ever
realized
the
vanity
of
his
fortune
the
thought
of
denise
suddenly
came
upon
him
that
thought
which
incessantly
pierced
him
with
a
flame
like
the
shooting
of
an
incurable
pain
and
then
he
ran
away
unable
to
find
a
word
of
satisfaction
fearful
lest
he
should
display
his
tears
and
leaving
behind
him
the
disgust
of
triumph
that
façade
which
was
at
last
erected
seemed
but
trifling
in
his
eyes
very
much
like
one
of
those
walls
of
sand
that
children
build
and
it
might
have
been
prolonged
from
one
end
of
the
city
to
the
other
elevated
to
the
starry
sky
and
yet
would
not
have
filled
the
void
of
his
heart
which
only
the
yes
of
a
mere
child
could
satisfy
when
mouret
returned
to
his
office
he
was
almost
choking
with
sobs
what
did
she
want
he
dared
not
offer
her
money
now
but
the
confused
idea
of
marriage
presented
itself
amidst
his
revolts
and
in
the
debility
of
his
powerlessness
his
tears
began
to
flow
he
was
indeed
very
unhappy
chapter
xiii
one
morning
in
november
denise
was
giving
her
first
orders
in
the
department
when
the
baudus
servant
came
to
tell
her
that
mademoiselle
geneviève
had
passed
a
very
bad
night
and
wished
to
see
her
immediately
for
some
time
the
poor
girl
had
been
getting
weaker
and
weaker
and
had
been
obliged
to
take
to
her
bed
two
days
before
say
i
am
coming
at
once
replied
denise
feeling
very
anxious
the
blow
which
was
finishing
geneviève
was
colomban
sudden
disappearance
at
first
chaffed
by
clara
he
had
grown
very
dissipated
then
yielding
to
the
wild
desires
which
at
times
master
sly
chaste
men
he
had
become
her
obedient
slave
and
one
monday
instead
of
returning
to
the
shop
had
sent
a
farewell
letter
to
baudu
written
in
the
studied
terms
of
one
who
is
about
to
commit
suicide
perhaps
at
the
bottom
of
this
freak
there
was
also
the
calculating
craft
of
a
man
delighted
at
escaping
from
a
disastrous
marriage
the
business
was
in
as
bad
a
way
as
his
betrothed
so
the
moment
was
a
propitious
one
for
breaking
with
them
both
and
every
one
cited
colomban
as
an
unfortunate
victim
of
love
when
denise
reached
the
old
elbeuf
madame
baudu
with
her
small
white
face
consumed
by
anæmia
was
there
alone
sitting
motionless
behind
the
and
watching
over
the
silence
and
emptiness
of
the
shop
there
was
no
assistant
now
the
servant
dusted
the
shelves
and
it
was
even
a
question
of
replacing
her
by
a
charwoman
a
dreary
cold
hung
about
the
ceiling
hours
passed
by
without
a
customer
coming
to
disturb
the
gloom
and
the
goods
no
longer
handled
became
more
and
more
musty
every
day
what
the
matter
asked
denise
anxiously
is
geneviève
in
danger
madame
baudu
did
not
at
first
reply
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
then
suddenly
she
stammered
i
do
know
they
do
tell
me
anything
ah
it
all
over
it
all
over
and
she
cast
a
dim
glance
round
the
dark
shop
as
if
she
felt
that
her
daughter
and
the
old
elbeuf
were
disappearing
together
the
seventy
thousand
francs
produced
by
the
sale
of
their
rambouillet
property
had
in
less
than
two
years
melted
away
in
the
abyss
of
competition
in
order
to
struggle
against
the
ladies
paradise
which
now
kept
men
cloths
even
materials
for
hunting
shooting
and
livery
suits
the
draper
had
made
considerable
sacrifices
but
at
last
he
had
been
altogether
crushed
by
the
cloths
and
the
flannels
sold
by
his
rival
an
assortment
that
had
not
its
equal
in
the
market
little
by
little
his
debts
had
increased
and
as
a
last
resource
he
had
resolved
to
mortgage
the
old
building
in
the
rue
de
la
michodière
where
finet
their
ancestor
had
founded
the
business
and
it
was
now
only
a
question
of
days
the
crumbling
away
had
nearly
finished
the
very
ceilings
seemed
to
be
falling
and
turning
into
dust
even
an
old
structure
is
carried
away
by
the
wind
your
uncle
is
upstairs
resumed
madame
baudu
in
her
broken
voice
we
each
stay
with
her
in
turn
for
a
couple
of
hours
some
one
must
stay
here
oh
but
only
as
a
precaution
for
to
tell
the
truth
her
gesture
finished
the
phrase
they
would
have
put
the
shutters
up
had
it
not
been
for
their
old
commercial
pride
which
still
kept
them
erect
in
the
presence
of
the
neighbours
well
i
go
up
aunt
said
denise
whose
heart
ached
amidst
the
resigned
despair
that
even
the
pieces
of
cloth
themselves
exhaled
yes
go
upstairs
quick
my
girl
she
expecting
you
she
been
asking
for
you
all
night
she
had
something
to
tell
you
but
just
at
that
moment
baudu
came
down
bile
had
now
given
his
yellow
face
a
greenish
hue
and
his
eyes
were
bloodshot
he
was
still
walking
with
the
muffled
tread
with
which
he
had
quitted
the
sick
room
and
murmured
as
though
he
might
be
overheard
upstairs
she
asleep
then
thoroughly
worn
out
he
sat
down
on
a
chair
mopping
his
forehead
with
a
mechanical
gesture
and
puffing
like
a
man
who
has
just
finished
some
hard
work
a
pause
ensued
but
at
last
he
said
to
denise
see
her
presently
when
she
is
sleeping
she
seems
to
us
to
be
all
right
again
again
did
silence
fall
face
to
face
the
father
and
mother
stood
looking
at
one
another
then
in
a
low
voice
he
went
over
his
grief
again
though
without
naming
any
one
or
addressing
any
one
directly
with
my
head
on
the
block
i
would
have
believed
it
he
was
the
last
one
i
had
brought
him
up
as
a
son
if
any
one
had
come
and
said
to
me
take
him
away
from
you
as
well
you
see
him
fall
i
should
have
replied
impossible
that
ca
happen
as
long
as
there
a
god
on
high
but
he
has
fallen
all
the
same
ah
the
poor
fellow
he
who
was
so
well
up
in
the
business
who
had
all
my
ideas
and
all
through
a
young
a
mere
dummy
fit
for
a
window
no
really
it
enough
to
drive
one
mad
he
shook
his
head
with
his
eyes
cast
upon
the
damp
floor
which
the
tread
of
generations
of
customers
had
worn
then
he
continued
in
a
lower
voice
shall
i
tell
you
well
there
are
moments
when
i
feel
myself
the
most
culpable
of
all
in
our
misfortune
yes
it
my
fault
if
our
poor
girl
is
lying
upstairs
devoured
by
fever
ought
i
not
to
have
married
them
at
once
without
yielding
to
my
stupid
pride
my
obstinacy
in
refusing
to
leave
them
the
business
in
a
less
prosperous
state
than
it
had
been
before
had
i
done
that
she
would
now
have
the
man
she
loved
and
perhaps
their
youthful
strength
united
would
have
accomplished
the
miracle
that
i
have
failed
to
work
but
i
am
an
old
fool
and
saw
through
nothing
i
did
know
that
people
fell
ill
over
such
things
really
he
was
an
extraordinary
fellow
he
had
such
a
gift
for
business
and
such
probity
such
simplicity
of
conduct
he
was
so
orderly
in
every
way
in
short
my
pupil
he
raised
his
head
still
defending
his
ideas
in
the
person
of
the
shopman
who
had
betrayed
him
denise
however
could
not
bear
to
hear
him
accuse
himself
and
carried
away
by
her
emotion
on
seeing
him
so
humble
with
his
eyes
full
of
tears
he
who
used
formerly
to
reign
there
as
an
absolute
and
scolding
master
she
told
him
everything
uncle
pray
do
excuse
him
said
she
he
never
loved
geneviève
he
would
have
run
away
sooner
if
you
had
tried
to
hasten
the
marriage
i
have
spoken
to
him
myself
about
it
he
was
perfectly
well
aware
that
my
poor
cousin
was
suffering
on
his
account
and
yet
you
see
that
did
not
prevent
him
from
leaving
ask
aunt
without
opening
her
lips
madame
baudu
confirmed
these
words
by
a
nod
the
draper
turned
paler
still
blinded
by
his
tears
and
then
he
stammered
out
it
must
have
been
in
the
blood
his
father
died
last
year
through
having
led
a
dissolute
life
and
once
more
he
looked
round
the
dim
shop
his
eyes
wandering
from
the
empty
counters
to
the
full
shelves
and
then
resting
on
madame
baudu
who
was
still
sitting
erect
at
the
waiting
in
vain
for
the
customers
who
did
not
come
well
said
he
it
all
over
they
ruined
our
business
and
now
one
of
their
hussies
is
killing
our
daughter
no
one
spoke
the
rolling
of
passing
vehicles
which
occasionally
shook
the
floor
seemed
like
a
funereal
beating
of
drums
in
the
still
air
so
stuffy
under
the
low
ceiling
but
suddenly
amidst
this
gloomy
sadness
peculiar
to
old
expiring
shops
several
dull
knocks
were
heard
proceeding
from
somewhere
in
the
house
it
was
geneviève
who
had
just
awoke
and
was
knocking
with
a
stick
they
had
left
beside
her
let
go
up
at
once
said
baudu
rising
with
a
start
and
try
to
be
cheerful
she
must
know
he
himself
as
he
went
upstairs
rubbed
his
eyes
in
order
to
remove
the
traces
of
his
tears
as
soon
as
he
opened
the
door
on
the
first
floor
they
heard
a
frightened
feeble
voice
crying
oh
i
do
like
to
be
left
alone
do
leave
me
i
afraid
to
be
left
alone
however
when
she
perceived
denise
geneviève
became
calmer
and
smiled
joyfully
you
come
then
how
i
been
longing
to
see
you
since
yesterday
i
thought
you
also
had
abandoned
me
it
was
a
piteous
spectacle
the
young
woman
room
a
little
room
into
which
came
a
livid
light
looked
out
on
to
the
yard
at
first
her
parents
had
put
her
in
their
room
in
the
front
part
of
the
house
but
the
sight
of
the
ladies
paradise
opposite
affected
her
so
deeply
that
they
had
been
obliged
to
bring
her
back
to
her
own
again
and
there
she
lay
so
very
thin
under
the
that
you
could
hardly
divine
the
form
and
existence
of
a
human
body
her
skinny
arms
consumed
by
the
burning
fever
of
consumption
were
in
a
perpetual
movement
of
anxious
unconscious
searching
whilst
her
black
hair
heavy
with
passion
seemed
thicker
still
and
to
be
preying
with
its
voracious
vitality
upon
her
poor
face
that
face
in
which
was
fading
the
final
degenerateness
of
a
long
lineage
a
family
that
had
grown
and
lived
in
the
gloom
of
that
cellar
of
old
commercial
paris
denise
her
heart
bursting
with
pity
stood
looking
at
her
she
did
not
at
first
speak
for
fear
of
giving
way
to
tears
however
she
at
last
murmured
i
came
at
once
can
i
be
of
any
use
to
you
you
asked
for
me
would
you
like
me
to
stay
no
thanks
i
do
need
anything
i
only
wanted
to
embrace
you
tears
filled
her
eyes
denise
quickly
leant
over
and
kissed
her
trembling
at
the
flame
which
came
from
those
hollow
cheeks
to
her
own
lips
but
geneviève
stretching
out
her
arms
caught
hold
of
her
and
kept
her
in
a
desperate
embrace
then
she
looked
towards
her
father
would
you
like
me
to
stay
repeated
denise
perhaps
there
is
something
i
can
do
for
you
no
no
geneviève
glance
was
still
obstinately
fixed
on
her
father
who
remained
standing
there
with
a
bewildered
air
almost
choking
however
he
at
last
understood
her
and
went
away
without
saying
a
word
they
heard
his
heavy
footsteps
descending
the
stairs
tell
me
is
he
with
that
woman
the
sick
girl
then
eagerly
inquired
while
catching
hold
of
her
cousin
hand
and
making
her
sit
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
yes
i
wanted
to
see
you
as
you
are
the
only
one
who
can
tell
me
they
together
are
they
in
the
surprise
which
these
questions
gave
her
denise
began
to
stammer
and
was
obliged
to
confess
the
truth
the
rumours
that
were
current
at
the
paradise
clara
it
was
said
had
already
grown
tired
of
colomban
who
was
pursuing
her
everywhere
striving
to
obtain
an
occasional
appointment
by
a
sort
of
canine
humility
it
was
also
said
that
he
was
about
to
take
a
situation
at
the
grands
magasins
du
louvre
if
you
love
him
so
much
he
may
yet
come
back
added
denise
seeking
to
cheer
the
dying
girl
with
this
last
hope
make
haste
and
get
well
he
will
acknowledge
his
errors
and
marry
you
but
geneviève
interrupted
her
she
had
listened
with
all
her
soul
with
an
intense
passion
which
had
raised
her
in
the
bed
now
however
she
fell
back
no
i
know
it
all
over
i
do
say
anything
because
i
see
papa
crying
and
i
do
wish
to
make
mamma
worse
than
she
is
but
i
am
going
denise
and
if
i
called
for
you
last
night
it
was
for
fear
of
going
off
before
the
morning
and
to
think
that
he
is
not
even
happy
after
all
then
as
denise
remonstrated
with
her
assuring
her
that
she
was
not
so
bad
as
all
that
she
again
cut
her
short
by
suddenly
throwing
back
the
with
the
chaste
gesture
of
a
virgin
who
has
nothing
to
conceal
in
death
her
bosom
bare
she
murmured
look
at
me
is
it
not
the
end
trembling
with
mingled
horror
and
pity
denise
hastily
rose
from
the
bed
as
if
she
feared
that
her
very
breath
might
suffice
to
destroy
that
puny
emaciated
form
geneviève
slowly
covered
her
bosom
again
saying
you
see
i
am
no
longer
a
woman
it
would
be
wrong
to
wish
for
him
still
silence
fell
between
them
they
continued
gazing
at
each
other
unable
to
find
a
word
to
say
at
last
it
was
geneviève
who
resumed
come
do
stay
any
longer
you
have
your
own
affairs
to
look
after
and
thanks
i
was
tormented
by
the
wish
to
know
and
now
am
satisfied
if
you
ever
see
him
again
tell
him
i
forgive
him
farewell
dear
denise
kiss
me
once
more
for
it
the
last
time
the
young
woman
kissed
her
still
protesting
no
no
do
despair
all
you
want
is
careful
nursing
nothing
more
but
the
sick
girl
smiled
shaking
her
head
in
an
obstinate
way
like
one
who
will
not
be
deceived
and
as
her
cousin
at
last
walked
towards
the
door
she
exclaimed
wait
a
minute
knock
on
the
floor
with
this
stick
so
that
papa
may
come
up
i
afraid
to
stay
alone
then
when
baudu
reached
the
little
dismal
room
where
he
spent
long
hours
seated
on
a
chair
she
assumed
an
air
of
gaiety
saying
to
denise
do
come
i
would
rather
not
but
on
sunday
i
shall
expect
you
you
can
spend
the
afternoon
with
me
the
next
morning
at
six
geneviève
expired
after
four
fearful
agony
the
funeral
took
place
on
a
saturday
a
dark
cloudy
day
with
a
sooty
sky
hanging
low
above
the
shivering
city
the
old
elbeuf
hung
with
white
drapery
lighted
up
the
street
with
a
bright
speck
and
the
candles
burning
in
the
gloom
seemed
like
so
many
stars
enveloped
in
twilight
wreaths
and
a
great
bouquet
of
white
roses
covered
the
coffin
a
narrow
child
coffin
placed
in
the
dark
passage
of
the
house
close
to
the
pavement
so
near
indeed
to
the
gutter
that
passing
vehicles
had
already
splashed
the
drapery
with
its
continual
rush
of
pedestrians
on
the
muddy
footways
the
whole
neighbourhood
reeked
of
dampness
exhaled
a
mouldy
odour
at
nine
denise
came
over
to
stay
with
her
aunt
but
when
the
funeral
was
about
to
start
the
latter
who
had
ceased
weeping
her
eyes
scorched
by
her
hot
tears
begged
her
to
follow
the
body
and
look
after
her
uncle
whose
mute
affliction
and
almost
idiotic
grief
filled
the
family
with
anxiety
downstairs
the
young
woman
found
the
street
full
of
people
for
the
small
traders
of
the
neighbourhood
were
anxious
to
give
the
baudus
a
mark
of
sympathy
and
in
their
eagerness
there
was
a
desire
for
a
demonstration
against
that
ladies
paradise
which
they
accused
of
having
caused
geneviève
slow
agony
all
the
victims
of
the
monster
were
there
bédoré
and
sister
the
hosiers
of
the
rue
gaillon
vanpouille
brothers
the
furriers
deslignières
the
toyman
and
piot
and
rivoire
the
furniture
dealers
even
mademoiselle
tatin
the
dealer
in
and
quinette
the
glover
though
long
since
cleared
off
by
bankruptcy
had
made
it
a
duty
to
come
the
one
from
batignolles
the
other
from
the
bastille
where
they
had
been
obliged
to
take
situations
and
whilst
waiting
for
the
hearse
which
was
late
all
these
people
clad
in
black
and
tramping
in
the
mud
cast
glances
of
hatred
towards
the
ladies
paradise
whose
bright
windows
and
gay
displays
seemed
an
insult
in
face
of
the
old
elbeuf
which
with
its
funeral
trappings
and
glimmering
candles
lent
an
air
of
mourning
to
the
other
side
of
the
street
the
faces
of
a
few
inquisitive
salesmen
appeared
at
the
windows
of
the
paradise
but
the
colossus
itself
preserved
the
indifference
of
a
machine
going
at
full
speed
unconscious
of
the
deaths
it
may
cause
on
the
road
denise
looked
round
for
her
brother
jean
and
at
last
perceived
him
standing
before
bourras
shop
whereupon
she
crossed
over
and
asked
him
to
walk
with
his
uncle
and
assist
him
should
he
be
unable
to
get
along
for
the
last
few
weeks
jean
had
been
very
grave
as
if
tormented
by
some
worry
that
morning
buttoned
up
in
his
black
for
he
was
now
a
man
earning
his
twenty
francs
a
day
he
seemed
so
dignified
and
sad
that
his
sister
was
surprised
having
had
no
idea
that
he
loved
their
cousin
so
much
desirous
of
sparing
pépé
a
needless
grief
she
had
left
him
with
madame
gras
intending
to
fetch
him
in
the
afternoon
to
see
his
uncle
and
aunt
however
the
hearse
had
still
not
arrived
and
denise
greatly
affected
stood
watching
the
candles
burn
when
she
was
startled
by
a
voice
behind
her
it
was
that
of
bourras
who
had
called
a
occupying
a
little
box
against
a
wine
shop
opposite
in
order
to
say
to
him
here
vigouroux
just
keep
a
on
my
place
will
you
you
see
i
taken
the
door
handle
away
if
any
one
comes
tell
them
to
call
again
but
do
let
that
disturb
you
no
one
will
come
then
he
also
took
his
stand
at
the
edge
of
the
pavement
waiting
like
the
others
denise
feeling
rather
awkward
glanced
at
his
shop
he
now
altogether
neglected
it
only
a
disorderly
collection
of
umbrellas
eaten
up
by
damp
and
canes
blackened
by
now
remained
in
the
window
the
embellishments
that
he
had
made
the
light
green
paint
work
the
mirrors
the
gilded
sign
were
all
cracking
already
getting
dirty
exhibiting
the
rapid
lamentable
decrepitude
of
false
luxury
laid
over
ruins
but
although
the
old
crevices
were
although
the
damp
spots
had
sprung
up
through
the
gilding
the
house
still
obstinately
held
its
ground
hanging
to
the
flanks
of
the
paradise
like
some
shameful
wart
which
although
cracked
and
rotten
yet
refused
to
fall
ah
the
scoundrels
growled
bourras
they
wo
even
let
her
be
carried
away
the
hearse
which
was
at
last
approaching
had
just
come
into
collision
with
one
of
the
paradise
vans
which
at
the
rapid
trot
of
two
superb
horses
went
spinning
along
shedding
in
the
mist
the
starry
radiance
of
its
shining
panels
and
from
under
his
bushy
eyebrows
the
old
man
cast
a
side
glance
at
denise
the
funeral
procession
started
at
a
slow
pace
splashing
through
muddy
puddles
amid
the
silence
of
the
omnibuses
and
cabs
which
were
suddenly
pulled
up
when
the
coffin
draped
with
white
crossed
the
place
gaillon
the
sombre
looks
of
the
followers
once
more
plunged
into
the
windows
of
the
big
establishment
where
only
two
saleswomen
stood
looking
on
pleased
with
the
diversion
baudu
followed
the
hearse
with
a
heavy
mechanical
step
refusing
by
a
sign
the
arm
offered
him
by
jean
who
walked
alongside
then
after
a
long
string
of
people
came
three
mourning
coaches
as
they
crossed
the
rue
robineau
looking
very
pale
and
much
older
ran
up
to
join
the
procession
at
a
great
many
women
were
waiting
small
traders
of
the
neighbourhood
who
had
wished
to
escape
the
crowd
at
the
house
of
mourning
the
demonstration
was
developing
into
quite
a
riot
and
when
after
the
funeral
service
the
procession
started
off
again
all
continued
to
follow
although
it
was
a
long
walk
from
the
rue
to
the
montmartre
cemetery
they
had
to
turn
up
the
rue
again
and
once
more
pass
the
ladies
paradise
it
was
a
sort
of
defiance
the
poor
girl
body
was
paraded
round
the
big
shop
like
that
of
a
first
victim
fallen
in
time
of
revolution
at
the
door
some
red
flannels
were
flapping
like
so
many
flags
and
a
display
of
carpets
blazed
forth
in
a
gory
efflorescence
of
huge
roses
and
peonies
denise
had
now
got
into
one
of
the
coaches
being
agitated
by
such
poignant
doubts
her
heart
oppressed
by
such
cruel
grief
that
she
had
not
the
strength
to
walk
further
in
the
rue
du
just
before
the
scaffolding
of
the
new
façade
which
still
obstructed
the
thoroughfare
there
was
a
stoppage
and
on
looking
out
the
girl
observed
old
bourras
behind
all
the
others
dragging
himself
along
with
difficulty
close
to
the
wheels
of
the
coach
in
which
she
was
riding
alone
he
would
never
get
as
far
as
the
cemetery
she
thought
however
he
raised
his
head
looked
at
her
and
all
at
once
got
into
the
coach
it
my
confounded
knees
he
exclaimed
do
draw
back
it
you
we
hate
she
felt
him
to
be
friendly
and
furious
as
in
former
days
he
grumbled
declared
that
baudu
must
be
fearfully
strong
to
be
able
to
keep
up
after
such
hard
blows
as
he
had
received
the
procession
had
again
started
off
at
the
same
slow
pace
and
on
leaning
out
once
more
denise
saw
her
uncle
walking
behind
the
hearse
with
his
heavy
step
which
seemed
to
regulate
the
rumbling
painful
march
of
the
cortège
then
she
threw
herself
back
into
her
corner
and
rocked
by
the
melancholy
movement
of
the
coach
began
listening
to
the
endless
complaints
of
the
old
umbrella
maker
the
police
ought
to
clear
the
public
thoroughfares
my
word
said
he
they
been
blocking
up
our
street
for
the
last
eighteen
months
with
the
scaffolding
of
their
façade
another
man
was
killed
on
it
the
other
day
never
mind
when
they
want
to
enlarge
any
further
they
have
to
throw
bridges
over
the
streets
people
say
there
are
now
two
thousand
seven
hundred
employees
and
that
the
turnover
will
amount
to
a
hundred
millions
this
year
a
hundred
millions
just
fancy
a
hundred
millions
denise
had
nothing
to
say
in
reply
the
procession
had
just
turned
into
the
rue
de
la
chaussée
where
it
was
stopped
by
a
block
of
vehicles
and
bourras
went
on
with
a
vague
expression
in
his
eyes
as
if
he
were
now
dreaming
aloud
he
still
failed
to
understand
the
triumph
achieved
by
the
ladies
paradise
but
he
acknowledged
the
defeat
of
the
traders
poor
robineau
done
for
he
looks
like
a
drowning
man
he
resumed
and
the
bédorés
and
the
vanpouilles
they
ca
keep
going
like
me
played
out
deslignières
will
die
of
apoplexy
piot
and
rivoire
have
had
the
jaundice
ah
poor
child
it
must
be
comical
for
those
looking
on
to
see
such
a
string
of
bankrupts
pass
besides
it
appears
that
the
clean
sweep
is
to
continue
those
scoundrels
are
creating
departments
for
flowers
bonnets
perfumery
boots
and
shoes
all
sorts
of
things
grognet
the
perfumer
in
the
rue
de
grammont
can
clear
out
and
i
would
give
ten
francs
for
naud
in
the
rue
the
cholera
even
spread
as
far
as
the
rue
lacassagne
at
the
feather
and
flower
shop
and
madame
chadeuil
whose
bonnets
are
so
will
be
swept
away
in
less
than
a
couple
of
years
and
after
those
will
come
others
and
still
others
all
the
businesses
in
the
neighbourhood
will
collapse
when
start
selling
soap
and
goloshes
they
are
quite
capable
of
dealing
in
fried
potatoes
my
word
the
world
is
turning
upside
down
the
hearse
had
just
then
crossed
the
place
de
la
trinité
and
from
the
corner
of
the
gloomy
coach
denise
who
lulled
by
the
funereal
march
of
the
procession
still
listened
to
the
old
man
endless
complaints
could
see
the
coffin
ascending
the
steep
rue
blanche
as
they
emerged
from
the
rue
de
la
chaussée
behind
her
uncle
who
was
plodding
along
with
the
blind
mute
face
of
an
ox
about
to
be
poleaxed
she
seemed
to
hear
the
tramping
of
a
flock
of
sheep
likewise
being
led
to
the
it
was
the
downfall
of
the
shops
of
an
entire
district
all
the
small
traders
dragging
their
ruin
amidst
the
thud
of
damp
shoes
through
the
black
mud
of
paris
bourras
however
still
continued
in
a
fainter
voice
as
if
fatigued
by
the
difficult
ascent
of
the
rue
blanche
as
for
me
i
settled
but
i
still
hold
on
all
the
same
and
let
him
go
he
just
lost
his
appeal
case
ah
that
cost
me
something
nearly
two
years
pleading
and
the
solicitors
and
the
barristers
never
mind
he
wo
pass
under
my
shop
the
judges
have
decided
that
such
work
as
that
could
not
be
considered
legitimate
repairing
just
fancy
he
talked
of
creating
underneath
my
place
a
saloon
where
his
people
might
judge
the
colours
of
the
stuffs
by
a
subterranean
room
which
would
have
joined
the
hosiery
to
the
drapery
departments
and
he
ca
get
over
it
he
ca
swallow
the
fact
that
an
old
wreck
like
me
should
stop
his
progress
when
all
the
others
are
on
their
knees
before
his
money
but
never
i
wo
have
it
that
understood
very
likely
i
may
be
worsted
since
i
have
had
to
fight
against
the
i
know
that
the
villain
has
been
buying
up
my
bills
in
the
hope
of
playing
me
some
villainous
trick
but
that
does
matter
he
says
and
i
say
and
i
shall
still
say
even
when
i
get
between
two
boards
like
that
poor
child
we
are
following
when
they
reached
the
boulevard
de
clichy
the
coach
rolled
on
at
a
quicker
pace
and
one
could
hear
the
heavy
breathing
the
unconscious
haste
of
the
followers
anxious
to
get
the
sad
ceremony
over
what
bourras
did
not
openly
mention
was
the
frightful
misery
into
which
he
himself
had
fallen
bewildered
by
the
worries
which
besiege
the
small
trader
who
is
on
the
road
to
ruin
and
yet
remains
obstinate
even
under
a
shower
of
protested
bills
denise
well
acquainted
with
his
position
at
last
broke
the
silence
by
saying
in
a
voice
of
entreaty
pray
do
stand
out
any
longer
monsieur
bourras
let
me
arrange
matters
for
you
but
he
interrupted
her
with
a
violent
gesture
you
be
quiet
nobody
business
you
a
good
little
girl
and
i
know
you
lead
him
a
hard
life
that
man
who
thought
you
were
for
sale
just
like
my
house
but
what
would
you
answer
if
i
advised
you
to
say
you
send
me
about
my
business
eh
and
so
when
i
say
do
you
interfere
in
the
matter
then
the
coach
having
stopped
at
the
cemetery
gate
he
alighted
from
it
with
the
young
girl
the
baudus
vault
was
reached
by
the
first
path
on
the
left
in
a
few
minutes
the
ceremony
was
over
jean
drew
away
his
uncle
who
was
looking
into
the
grave
all
agape
the
mourners
spread
about
amongst
the
neighbouring
tombs
and
the
faces
of
all
these
shopkeepers
their
blood
impoverished
by
living
in
damp
unhealthy
shops
assumed
an
ugly
suffering
look
under
the
leaden
sky
when
the
coffin
gently
slipped
down
their
blotched
and
pimpled
cheeks
paled
and
their
bleared
eyes
blinded
by
the
constant
contemplation
of
figures
turned
away
we
ought
all
to
jump
into
that
hole
said
bourras
to
denise
who
had
kept
close
to
him
in
burying
that
poor
girl
they
burying
the
whole
district
oh
i
know
what
i
say
the
old
style
of
business
may
go
and
join
the
white
roses
they
throwing
on
her
coffin
denise
brought
her
uncle
and
brother
back
in
a
mourning
coach
the
day
was
for
her
dark
and
melancholy
in
the
first
place
she
began
to
get
anxious
at
seeing
jean
so
pale
and
when
she
understood
that
it
was
on
account
of
another
sweetheart
she
tried
to
quiet
him
by
opening
her
purse
but
he
shook
his
head
and
refused
saying
it
was
a
serious
matter
this
time
the
niece
of
a
very
rich
who
would
not
accept
even
a
bunch
of
violets
afterwards
in
the
afternoon
when
denise
went
to
fetch
pépé
from
madame
gras
the
latter
declared
that
he
was
getting
too
big
for
her
to
keep
any
longer
and
this
was
another
annoyance
for
it
would
be
necessary
to
find
him
a
school
perhaps
send
him
away
and
to
crown
all
on
bringing
pépé
to
kiss
his
aunt
and
uncle
denise
heart
was
rent
by
the
gloomy
sadness
of
the
old
elbeuf
the
shop
was
closed
and
the
old
couple
were
sitting
in
the
little
where
they
had
forgotten
to
light
the
gas
notwithstanding
the
complete
obscurity
in
which
it
was
plunged
that
winter
day
they
were
now
quite
alone
face
to
face
in
the
house
which
ruin
had
slowly
emptied
and
their
daughter
death
filled
the
dark
corners
with
a
deeper
gloom
and
seemed
like
the
beginning
of
that
final
dismemberment
which
would
break
up
the
old
rafters
preyed
upon
by
damp
beneath
the
crushing
blow
her
uncle
unable
to
stop
himself
still
kept
walking
round
and
round
the
table
with
his
step
seeing
nothing
and
silent
whilst
her
aunt
who
said
nothing
either
remained
huddled
together
on
a
chair
with
the
white
face
of
one
who
is
wounded
and
whose
blood
is
running
away
drop
by
drop
they
did
not
even
weep
when
pépé
covered
their
cold
cheeks
with
kisses
for
her
part
denise
was
choking
with
tears
that
same
evening
mouret
sent
for
the
young
woman
to
speak
to
her
about
a
child
garment
which
he
wished
to
launch
a
mixture
of
the
scotch
and
zouave
costumes
and
still
trembling
with
pity
shocked
by
so
much
suffering
she
could
not
contain
herself
and
to
begin
with
ventured
to
speak
of
bourras
that
poor
old
man
who
was
down
and
whom
they
were
about
to
ruin
but
on
hearing
the
umbrella
maker
name
mouret
flew
into
a
rage
the
old
madman
as
he
called
him
was
the
plague
of
his
life
and
spoilt
his
triumph
by
his
idiotic
obstinacy
in
not
giving
up
his
house
that
ignoble
hovel
which
was
a
disgrace
to
the
paradise
the
only
little
corner
of
the
vast
block
that
had
escaped
conquest
the
matter
was
becoming
a
perfect
nightmare
any
one
else
but
denise
speaking
in
favour
of
bourras
would
have
run
the
risk
of
immediate
dismissal
so
violently
was
mouret
tortured
by
the
sickly
desire
to
kick
the
old
hovel
down
in
short
what
did
they
wish
him
to
do
could
he
leave
that
heap
of
ruins
sticking
to
the
ladies
paradise
it
would
have
to
go
the
shop
must
pass
along
so
much
the
worse
for
the
old
fool
and
he
spoke
of
his
repeated
proposals
he
had
offered
him
as
much
as
a
hundred
thousand
francs
was
that
fair
he
never
higgled
he
gave
whatever
money
was
required
but
in
return
he
expected
people
to
be
reasonable
and
allow
him
to
finish
his
work
did
any
one
ever
try
to
stop
engines
on
a
railway
to
all
this
denise
listened
with
drooping
eyes
unable
on
her
side
to
find
any
but
purely
sentimental
reasons
the
poor
fellow
was
so
old
they
might
have
waited
till
his
death
a
bankruptcy
would
kill
him
then
mouret
added
that
he
was
no
longer
able
to
prevent
things
following
their
course
bourdoncle
had
taken
the
matter
up
for
the
board
had
resolved
to
put
an
end
to
it
so
she
could
say
nothing
more
notwithstanding
the
grievous
pity
which
she
felt
for
her
old
friend
after
a
painful
silence
mouret
himself
began
to
speak
of
the
baudus
by
expressing
his
sorrow
at
the
death
of
their
daughter
they
were
very
worthy
and
very
honest
people
but
had
been
pursued
by
the
worst
of
luck
then
he
resumed
his
arguments
at
bottom
they
had
really
brought
about
their
own
misfortunes
by
obstinately
clinging
to
the
old
customs
in
their
place
it
was
not
astonishing
that
their
house
should
be
falling
about
their
heads
he
had
predicted
it
scores
of
times
she
must
even
remember
that
he
had
told
her
to
warn
her
uncle
of
a
fatal
disaster
if
he
should
still
cling
to
his
stupid
ways
and
the
catastrophe
had
arrived
no
one
in
the
world
could
now
prevent
it
people
could
not
reasonably
expect
him
to
ruin
himself
to
save
the
neighbourhood
besides
if
he
had
been
foolish
enough
to
close
the
ladies
paradise
another
great
establishment
would
have
sprung
up
of
itself
next
door
for
the
idea
was
now
starting
from
the
four
corners
of
the
globe
the
triumph
of
these
manufacturing
and
trading
centres
was
sown
by
the
spirit
of
the
age
which
was
sweeping
away
the
falling
edifices
of
ancient
times
little
by
little
as
he
went
on
speaking
mouret
warmed
up
and
with
eloquent
emotion
defended
himself
against
the
hatred
of
his
involuntary
victims
against
the
clamour
of
the
small
moribund
businesses
that
he
could
hear
around
him
they
could
not
keep
their
dead
above
ground
he
continued
they
must
bury
them
and
with
a
gesture
he
consigned
the
corpse
of
trading
to
the
grave
swept
into
the
common
hole
all
those
putrifying
pestilential
remains
which
were
becoming
a
disgrace
to
the
bright
streets
of
new
paris
no
no
he
felt
no
remorse
he
was
simply
doing
the
work
of
his
age
and
she
knew
it
she
who
loved
life
who
had
a
passion
for
vast
transactions
settled
in
the
full
glare
of
publicity
reduced
to
silence
she
listened
to
him
for
some
time
longer
and
then
went
away
her
soul
full
of
trouble
that
night
denise
slept
but
little
insomnia
interspersed
with
nightmare
kept
her
turning
over
and
over
in
her
bed
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
was
again
quite
a
little
girl
and
burst
into
tears
in
their
garden
at
valognes
on
seeing
the
blackcaps
eat
up
the
spiders
which
themselves
devoured
the
flies
was
it
then
really
true
that
it
was
necessary
for
the
world
to
fatten
on
death
that
it
was
necessary
there
should
be
this
struggle
for
existence
whereby
humanity
drew
even
increase
of
life
from
the
ossuaries
of
eternal
destruction
and
afterwards
she
again
found
herself
before
the
grave
into
which
they
had
lowered
geneviève
and
then
she
perceived
her
uncle
and
aunt
alone
in
their
gloomy
a
dull
sound
as
of
something
toppling
sped
through
the
still
atmosphere
it
was
bourras
house
giving
way
as
if
undermined
by
a
high
tide
then
silence
fell
again
more
sinister
than
ever
and
a
fresh
crash
was
heard
then
another
and
another
the
robineaus
the
bédorés
the
vanpouilles
were
cracking
and
falling
in
their
turn
all
the
small
shops
of
the
quarter
were
disappearing
beneath
an
invisible
pick
with
the
sudden
thundering
noise
of
bricks
falling
from
a
cart
then
intense
grief
awoke
her
with
a
start
heavens
what
tortures
there
were
families
weeping
old
men
thrown
into
the
street
all
the
poignant
dramas
of
ruin
and
she
could
save
nobody
and
even
felt
that
it
was
right
that
all
this
compost
of
misery
was
necessary
for
the
health
of
the
paris
of
the
future
when
day
broke
she
became
calmer
but
a
feeling
of
resigned
sadness
still
kept
her
awake
turned
towards
the
window
whose
panes
were
brightening
yes
it
was
the
needful
meed
of
blood
every
revolution
required
martyrs
each
step
forward
is
taken
over
the
bodies
of
the
dead
her
fear
of
being
a
wicked
girl
of
having
helped
to
effect
the
ruin
of
her
kindred
now
melted
into
heartfelt
pity
in
face
of
these
evils
beyond
remedy
which
are
like
the
labour
pangs
of
each
generation
birth
she
finished
by
trying
to
devise
some
possible
comfort
her
kindly
heart
dreaming
of
the
means
to
be
employed
in
order
to
save
her
relations
at
least
from
the
final
crash
and
now
mouret
appeared
before
her
with
his
impassioned
face
and
caressing
eyes
he
would
certainly
refuse
her
nothing
she
felt
sure
that
he
would
accord
all
reasonable
compensations
and
her
thoughts
strayed
seeking
to
judge
him
she
knew
his
life
and
was
aware
of
the
calculating
nature
of
his
former
affections
his
continual
exploitation
of
woman
his
intimacy
with
madame
desforges
the
sole
object
of
which
had
been
to
get
hold
of
baron
hartmann
and
with
all
the
others
such
as
clara
and
the
rest
but
these
beginnings
which
were
the
talk
of
the
shop
gradually
disappeared
in
presence
of
the
man
genius
and
victorious
grace
he
was
seduction
itself
what
she
could
never
have
forgiven
was
his
former
deception
real
coldness
hidden
beneath
a
gallant
affectation
of
affection
but
she
felt
herself
to
be
entirely
without
rancour
now
that
he
was
suffering
through
her
this
suffering
had
elevated
him
when
she
saw
him
tortured
by
her
refusal
atoning
so
fully
for
his
former
disdain
for
woman
he
seemed
to
her
to
make
amends
for
many
of
his
faults
that
very
morning
denise
obtained
from
mouret
a
promise
of
whatever
compensation
she
might
consider
reasonable
on
the
day
when
the
baudus
and
old
bourras
should
succumb
weeks
passed
away
during
which
she
went
to
see
her
uncle
nearly
every
afternoon
escaping
from
her
department
for
a
few
minutes
and
bringing
her
smiling
face
and
girlish
courage
to
enliven
the
dark
shop
she
was
especially
anxious
about
her
aunt
who
had
fallen
into
a
dull
stupor
ever
since
geneviève
death
it
seemed
as
if
her
life
was
quitting
her
hourly
though
when
people
questioned
her
she
would
reply
with
an
astonished
air
that
she
was
not
suffering
but
simply
felt
as
if
overcome
by
sleep
the
neighbours
however
shook
their
heads
saying
she
would
not
live
long
to
regret
her
daughter
one
day
denise
was
coming
from
the
baudus
when
on
turning
the
corner
of
the
place
gaillon
she
heard
a
loud
cry
a
crowd
rushed
forward
a
panic
arose
that
breath
of
fear
and
pity
which
suddenly
brings
all
the
people
in
a
street
together
it
was
a
brown
omnibus
belonging
to
the
line
which
had
run
over
a
man
at
the
entrance
of
the
rue
just
opposite
the
fountain
standing
up
in
his
seat
the
driver
whilst
furiously
holding
in
his
two
black
horses
which
were
rearing
cried
out
in
a
great
passion
confound
it
confound
it
why
do
you
look
out
you
idiot
the
omnibus
had
now
been
brought
to
a
standstill
the
crowd
had
surrounded
the
injured
man
and
a
policeman
happened
to
be
on
the
spot
still
standing
up
and
invoking
the
testimony
of
the
outside
passengers
who
had
also
risen
to
look
over
and
see
the
the
coachman
with
exasperated
gestures
and
choked
by
increasing
anger
was
explaining
the
matter
it
something
fearful
said
he
who
could
have
expected
such
a
thing
that
fellow
was
walking
along
quite
at
home
and
when
i
called
out
to
him
he
at
once
threw
himself
under
the
wheels
then
a
who
had
run
up
brush
in
hand
from
a
neighbouring
exclaimed
in
a
sharp
voice
amidst
the
clamour
do
excite
yourself
i
saw
him
he
threw
himself
under
he
jumped
in
head
first
like
that
another
one
tired
of
life
no
doubt
others
spoke
up
and
all
agreed
that
it
was
a
case
of
suicide
whilst
the
policeman
pulled
out
his
and
made
an
entry
several
ladies
all
very
pale
quickly
alighted
and
ran
away
without
looking
back
filled
with
horror
by
the
sudden
shaking
which
had
stirred
them
when
the
omnibus
passed
over
the
body
denise
however
drew
nearer
attracted
by
a
practical
pity
which
prompted
her
to
interest
herself
in
the
victims
of
all
sorts
of
street
accidents
such
as
wounded
dogs
horses
down
and
tilers
falling
off
roofs
and
she
immediately
recognised
the
unfortunate
fellow
who
had
fainted
away
there
in
the
road
his
clothes
covered
with
mud
it
monsieur
robineau
she
exclaimed
in
her
grievous
astonishment
the
policeman
at
once
questioned
the
young
woman
and
she
gave
the
victim
name
profession
and
address
thanks
to
the
driver
energy
the
omnibus
had
swerved
and
thus
only
robineau
legs
had
gone
under
the
wheels
however
it
was
to
be
feared
that
they
were
both
broken
four
men
carried
him
to
a
chemist
shop
in
the
rue
gaillon
whilst
the
omnibus
slowly
resumed
its
journey
my
stars
said
the
driver
whipping
up
his
horses
i
done
a
famous
day
work
denise
followed
robineau
into
the
chemist
the
latter
pending
the
arrival
of
a
doctor
who
was
not
to
be
found
declared
that
there
was
no
immediate
danger
and
that
the
injured
man
had
better
be
taken
home
as
he
lived
in
the
neighbourhood
a
man
then
started
off
to
the
for
a
stretcher
and
denise
had
the
happy
thought
of
going
on
in
front
so
as
to
prepare
madame
robineau
for
this
frightful
blow
but
she
had
the
greatest
trouble
in
the
world
to
get
into
the
street
again
through
the
crowd
which
was
struggling
before
the
door
of
the
chemist
shop
this
crowd
attracted
by
death
was
every
minute
increasing
men
women
and
children
stood
on
and
held
their
own
amidst
brutal
pushing
and
each
had
his
version
to
give
of
the
accident
so
that
at
last
the
victim
was
said
to
be
a
husband
who
had
been
pitched
out
of
window
by
his
wife
lover
in
the
rue
denise
perceived
from
a
distance
madame
robineau
on
the
threshold
of
the
silk
warehouse
this
gave
her
a
pretext
for
stopping
and
she
talked
on
for
a
moment
trying
to
find
a
means
of
breaking
the
terrible
news
the
place
wore
the
disorderly
neglectful
aspect
of
a
shop
in
the
last
agony
one
whose
business
is
fast
dying
it
was
the
inevitable
end
of
the
great
battle
of
the
rival
silks
the
paris
delight
had
destroyed
competition
by
a
fresh
reduction
of
a
sou
it
was
now
sold
at
four
francs
nineteen
sous
the
mêtre
and
gaujean
silk
had
found
its
waterloo
for
the
last
two
months
robineau
reduced
to
all
sorts
of
shifts
had
been
leading
a
fearful
life
trying
to
avert
a
declaration
of
bankruptcy
i
saw
your
husband
crossing
the
place
gaillon
murmured
denise
who
had
ended
by
entering
the
shop
thereupon
madame
robineau
whom
a
secret
anxiety
seemed
to
be
continually
attracting
towards
the
street
said
quickly
ah
a
little
while
ago
was
it
i
waiting
for
him
he
ought
to
be
back
by
now
monsieur
gaujean
came
this
morning
and
they
went
out
together
she
was
still
charming
delicate
and
gay
but
was
in
a
delicate
state
of
health
and
seemed
more
frightened
more
bewildered
than
ever
by
those
dreadful
business
matters
which
she
did
not
understand
and
which
were
all
going
wrong
as
she
often
said
what
was
the
use
of
it
all
would
it
not
be
better
to
live
quietly
in
some
small
lodging
and
be
contented
with
modest
fare
my
dear
child
she
resumed
with
her
pretty
smile
which
was
becoming
sadder
we
have
nothing
to
conceal
from
you
things
are
not
going
well
and
my
poor
darling
is
worried
to
death
again
this
man
gaujean
has
been
tormenting
him
about
some
overdue
bills
i
was
dying
with
anxiety
at
being
left
here
all
alone
and
she
was
once
more
returning
to
the
door
when
denise
stopped
her
having
heard
the
noise
of
a
crowd
and
guessing
that
it
was
the
injured
man
being
brought
along
surrounded
by
a
mob
of
idlers
anxious
to
see
the
end
of
the
affair
and
thereupon
with
her
throat
parched
unable
to
find
the
consoling
words
she
would
have
liked
to
say
she
had
to
explain
the
matter
do
be
anxious
there
no
immediate
danger
i
seen
monsieur
robineau
he
has
met
with
an
accident
they
are
just
bringing
him
home
pray
do
be
frightened
the
young
woman
listened
to
her
white
as
a
sheet
and
as
yet
not
clearly
understanding
her
the
street
was
full
of
people
and
unable
to
get
along
were
swearing
while
the
bearers
set
the
stretcher
before
the
shop
in
order
to
open
both
glass
doors
it
was
an
accident
continued
denise
determined
to
conceal
the
attempt
at
suicide
he
was
on
the
pavement
and
slipped
under
the
wheels
of
an
omnibus
only
his
feet
are
hurt
they
sent
for
a
doctor
do
be
frightened
a
great
shudder
shook
madame
robineau
she
gave
vent
to
a
few
inarticulate
cries
then
said
no
more
but
sank
down
beside
the
stretcher
drawing
its
covering
aside
with
her
trembling
hands
the
men
who
had
brought
it
were
waiting
to
take
it
away
as
soon
as
the
doctor
should
arrive
they
dared
not
touch
robineau
who
had
now
regained
consciousness
and
whose
sufferings
became
frightful
at
the
slightest
movement
when
he
saw
his
wife
big
tears
ran
down
his
cheeks
she
embraced
him
and
stood
looking
at
him
fixedly
and
weeping
out
in
the
street
the
tumult
was
increasing
the
people
pressed
forward
as
with
glistening
eyes
at
a
theatre
some
girls
fresh
from
a
workshop
were
almost
pushing
through
the
windows
in
their
eagerness
to
see
what
was
going
on
then
denise
in
order
to
avoid
this
feverish
curiosity
and
thinking
moreover
that
it
was
not
right
to
leave
the
shop
open
decided
to
let
the
metal
shutters
down
she
went
and
turned
the
winch
whose
wheels
gave
out
a
plaintive
cry
whilst
the
sheets
of
iron
slowly
descended
like
the
heavy
draperies
of
a
curtain
falling
on
the
catastrophe
of
a
fifth
act
and
when
she
went
in
again
after
closing
the
little
round
door
in
the
shutters
she
found
madame
robineau
still
clasping
her
husband
in
her
arms
in
the
vague
which
came
from
the
two
stars
cut
in
the
the
ruined
shop
seemed
to
be
gliding
into
nothingness
those
two
stars
alone
glittered
on
this
sudden
and
brutal
catastrophe
of
the
streets
of
paris
at
last
madame
robineau
recovered
her
speech
oh
my
darling
oh
my
darling
my
darling
this
was
all
she
could
say
and
he
half
choking
confessed
himself
a
prey
to
keen
remorse
now
that
he
saw
her
kneeling
thus
before
him
when
he
did
not
move
he
only
felt
the
burning
weight
of
his
legs
forgive
me
i
must
have
been
mad
but
when
the
lawyer
told
me
before
gaujean
that
the
posters
would
be
put
up
i
saw
flames
dancing
before
my
eyes
as
if
the
walls
were
on
fire
after
that
i
remember
nothing
i
was
coming
down
the
rue
de
la
michodière
and
i
fancied
that
the
paradise
people
were
laughing
at
me
that
big
rascally
house
seemed
to
crush
me
so
when
the
omnibus
came
up
i
thought
of
lhomme
and
his
arm
and
threw
myself
under
the
wheels
madame
robineau
had
slowly
fallen
on
to
the
floor
horrified
by
this
confession
heavens
he
had
tried
to
kill
himself
she
caught
hold
of
the
hand
of
denise
who
was
leaning
towards
her
also
quite
overcome
the
injured
man
exhausted
by
emotion
had
just
fainted
away
again
the
doctor
had
still
not
arrived
two
men
had
been
scouring
the
neighbourhood
for
him
and
the
doorkeeper
belonging
to
the
house
had
now
gone
to
seek
him
in
his
turn
pray
do
be
anxious
denise
kept
on
repeating
mechanically
herself
also
sobbing
then
madame
robineau
seated
on
the
floor
with
her
head
on
a
level
with
the
stretcher
her
cheek
resting
against
the
sacking
on
which
her
husband
was
lying
relieved
her
heart
oh
i
must
tell
you
it
all
for
me
that
he
wanted
to
die
he
always
saying
robbed
you
it
was
your
money
and
at
night
he
dreamed
of
those
sixty
thousand
francs
waking
up
covered
with
perspiration
calling
himself
an
incompetent
fellow
and
saying
that
those
who
have
no
head
for
business
ought
not
to
risk
other
people
money
you
know
that
he
has
always
been
nervous
and
apt
to
worry
himself
he
finished
by
conjuring
up
things
that
frightened
me
he
pictured
me
in
the
street
in
tatters
begging
me
whom
he
loved
so
dearly
whom
he
longed
to
see
rich
and
happy
the
poor
woman
paused
on
turning
her
head
she
saw
that
her
husband
had
opened
his
eyes
then
she
continued
stammering
my
darling
why
have
you
done
this
you
must
think
me
very
wicked
i
assure
you
i
do
care
if
we
are
ruined
so
long
as
we
are
together
we
shall
never
be
unhappy
let
them
take
everything
and
we
will
go
away
somewhere
where
you
wo
hear
any
more
about
them
you
can
still
work
you
see
how
happy
we
shall
be
she
let
her
forehead
fall
near
her
husband
pale
face
and
both
remained
speechless
in
the
emotion
of
their
anguish
silence
fell
the
shop
seemed
to
be
sleeping
benumbed
by
the
pale
twilight
which
enveloped
it
whilst
from
behind
the
thin
metal
shutters
came
the
uproar
of
the
street
the
life
of
broad
daylight
passing
along
with
the
rumbling
of
vehicles
and
the
hustling
and
pushing
of
the
crowd
at
last
denise
who
went
every
other
minute
to
glance
through
the
door
leading
to
the
hall
of
the
house
came
back
here
the
doctor
it
was
a
young
fellow
with
bright
eyes
whom
the
doorkeeper
had
found
and
brought
in
he
preferred
to
examine
the
injured
man
before
they
put
him
to
bed
only
one
of
his
legs
the
left
one
was
broken
above
the
ankle
it
was
a
simple
fracture
no
serious
complication
appeared
likely
to
result
from
it
and
they
were
about
to
carry
the
stretcher
into
the
when
gaujean
arrived
he
came
to
give
them
an
account
of
a
last
attempt
to
settle
matters
an
attempt
moreover
which
had
failed
the
declaration
of
bankruptcy
was
unavoidable
dear
me
murmured
he
what
the
matter
in
a
few
words
denise
informed
him
then
he
stopped
feeling
awkward
while
robineau
said
in
a
feeble
voice
i
do
bear
you
any
but
all
this
is
partly
your
fault
well
my
dear
fellow
replied
gaujean
it
wanted
stronger
men
than
ourselves
you
know
i
not
in
a
much
better
position
than
you
are
they
raised
the
stretcher
robineau
still
found
strength
to
say
no
no
stronger
fellows
than
us
would
have
given
way
as
we
have
i
can
understand
such
obstinate
old
men
as
bourras
and
baudu
standing
out
but
for
you
and
i
who
are
young
who
had
accepted
the
new
style
of
things
it
was
wrong
no
gaujean
it
the
last
of
a
world
they
carried
him
off
madame
robineau
embraced
denise
with
an
eagerness
in
which
there
was
almost
a
feeling
of
joy
at
having
at
last
got
rid
of
all
those
worrying
business
matters
and
as
gaujean
went
away
with
the
young
girl
he
confessed
to
her
that
robineau
poor
devil
was
right
it
was
idiotic
to
try
to
struggle
against
the
ladies
paradise
personally
he
felt
he
would
be
lost
if
he
did
not
get
back
into
its
good
graces
the
night
before
in
fact
he
had
secretly
made
a
proposal
to
hutin
who
was
just
leaving
for
lyons
but
he
felt
very
doubtful
and
tried
to
interest
denise
in
the
matter
aware
no
doubt
of
her
powerful
influence
upon
my
word
said
he
so
much
the
worse
for
the
manufacturers
every
one
would
laugh
at
me
if
i
ruined
myself
in
fighting
for
other
people
benefit
when
those
fellows
are
struggling
as
to
who
shall
make
at
the
cheapest
price
as
you
said
some
time
ago
the
manufacturers
have
only
to
follow
the
march
of
progress
by
a
better
organization
and
new
methods
everything
will
come
all
right
it
is
sufficient
that
the
public
are
satisfied
denise
smiled
and
replied
go
and
tell
that
to
monsieur
mouret
himself
your
visit
will
please
him
and
he
not
the
man

madame
baudu
died
one
bright
sunny
afternoon
in
january
for
a
fortnight
she
had
been
unable
to
go
down
into
the
shop
which
a
charwoman
now
looked
after
she
sat
in
the
centre
of
her
bed
propped
up
by
some
pillows
nothing
but
her
eyes
seemed
to
be
alive
in
her
white
face
and
with
head
erect
she
obstinately
gazed
upon
the
paradise
opposite
through
the
small
curtains
of
the
windows
baudu
himself
suffering
from
the
same
obsession
from
the
despairing
fixity
of
her
gaze
sometimes
wanted
to
draw
the
larger
curtains
but
she
stopped
him
with
an
imploring
gesture
obstinately
desirous
of
looking
and
looking
till
the
last
moment
should
come
the
monster
had
now
robbed
her
of
everything
her
business
her
daughter
she
herself
had
gradually
died
away
with
the
old
elbeuf
losing
some
part
of
her
life
as
the
shop
lost
its
customers
the
day
it
succumbed
she
had
no
more
breath
left
when
she
felt
she
was
dying
she
still
found
strength
to
insist
on
her
husband
opening
both
windows
it
was
very
mild
a
bright
ray
of
sunshine
gilded
the
ladies
paradise
whilst
the
of
the
old
house
shivered
in
the
shade
madame
baudu
lay
there
with
eyes
fixed
full
of
that
vision
of
the
triumphal
monument
those
clear
limpid
windows
behind
which
a
gallop
of
millions
was
passing
but
slowly
her
eyes
grew
dim
invaded
by
darkness
and
when
their
last
gleam
had
expired
in
death
they
remained
wide
open
still
gazing
and
wet
with
tears
once
more
all
the
ruined
traders
of
the
district
followed
the
funeral
procession
there
were
the
brothers
vanpouille
pale
at
the
thought
of
their
december
bills
met
by
a
supreme
effort
which
they
would
never
be
able
to
repeat
bédoré
accompanying
his
sister
leant
on
his
cane
so
full
of
worry
and
anxiety
that
his
liver
complaint
was
getting
worse
every
day
deslignières
had
had
a
fit
piot
and
rivoire
walked
on
in
silence
with
downcast
looks
like
men
entirely
played
out
and
they
dared
not
question
each
other
about
those
who
had
disappeared
quinette
mademoiselle
tatin
and
others
who
in
the
space
of
a
day
sank
ruined
swept
away
by
the
flood
of
disasters
without
counting
robineau
still
in
bed
with
his
broken
leg
but
they
pointed
with
an
especial
air
of
interest
to
the
new
tradesmen
attacked
by
the
plague
grognet
the
perfumer
madame
chadeuil
the
milliner
lacassagne
the
and
naud
the
who
were
still
on
their
legs
but
full
of
anxiety
at
thought
of
the
evil
which
would
doubtless
sweep
them
away
in
their
turn
baudu
walked
behind
the
hearse
with
the
same
heavy
stolid
step
as
when
he
had
followed
his
daughter
whilst
in
the
first
mourning
coach
could
be
seen
bourras
eyes
sparkling
under
his
bushy
eyebrows
and
hair
of
a
snowy
whiteness
denise
was
in
great
trouble
for
the
last
fortnight
she
had
been
worn
out
with
fatigue
and
anxiety
she
had
been
obliged
to
put
pépé
to
school
and
had
been
running
about
on
account
of
jean
who
was
so
stricken
with
the
pastrycook
niece
that
he
had
implored
his
sister
to
go
and
ask
her
hand
in
marriage
then
her
aunt
death
this
fresh
catastrophe
had
quite
overwhelmed
the
young
girl
though
mouret
had
again
offered
his
services
giving
her
leave
to
do
what
she
liked
for
her
uncle
and
the
others
one
morning
she
had
yet
another
interview
with
him
at
the
news
that
bourras
had
been
turned
into
the
street
and
that
baudu
was
going
to
shut
up
shop
then
she
went
out
after
lunch
in
the
hope
of
at
least
comforting
these
two
in
the
rue
de
la
michodière
bourras
was
standing
on
the
foot
pavement
opposite
his
house
whence
he
had
been
evicted
on
the
previous
day
by
a
fine
trick
a
discovery
of
the
lawyers
as
mouret
held
several
bills
he
had
easily
obtained
an
order
in
bankruptcy
against
the
and
then
had
given
five
hundred
francs
for
the
expiring
lease
at
the
sale
ordered
by
the
court
so
that
the
obstinate
old
man
had
for
five
hundred
francs
allowed
himself
to
be
deprived
of
what
he
had
refused
to
surrender
for
a
hundred
thousand
the
architect
who
came
with
his
gang
of
workmen
had
been
obliged
to
employ
the
police
to
get
him
out
the
goods
had
been
taken
and
sold
the
rooms
cleared
however
he
still
obstinately
remained
in
the
corner
where
he
slept
and
from
which
out
of
pity
they
did
not
like
to
drive
him
the
workmen
even
attacked
the
roofing
over
his
head
they
took
off
the
rotten
slates
the
ceilings
fell
in
and
the
walls
cracked
and
yet
he
remained
there
under
the
bare
old
beams
amidst
the
ruins
at
last
when
the
police
came
he
went
away
but
on
the
following
morning
he
again
appeared
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
after
passing
the
night
in
a
of
the
neighbourhood
monsieur
bourras
said
denise
kindly
he
did
not
hear
her
for
his
flaming
eyes
were
devouring
the
workmen
who
were
attacking
the
front
of
the
hovel
with
their
picks
through
the
glassless
windows
you
could
see
the
inside
of
the
house
the
wretched
rooms
and
the
black
staircase
to
which
the
sun
had
not
penetrated
for
the
last
two
hundred
years
ah
it
you
he
replied
at
last
when
he
recognised
her
a
nice
bit
of
work
they
doing
eh
the
robbers
she
no
longer
dared
to
speak
her
heart
was
stirred
by
the
lamentable
wretchedness
of
the
old
place
she
was
unable
to
take
her
eyes
off
the
mouldy
stones
that
were
falling
up
above
on
a
corner
of
the
ceiling
of
her
old
room
she
once
more
perceived
that
name
ernestine
written
in
black
and
shaky
letters
with
the
flame
of
a
candle
and
the
remembrance
of
her
days
of
misery
came
back
to
her
inspiring
her
with
a
tender
sympathy
for
all
suffering
however
the
workmen
in
order
to
knock
one
of
the
walls
down
at
a
blow
had
attacked
it
at
its
base
it
was
already
tottering
if
only
it
could
crush
them
all
growled
bourras
in
a
savage
voice
there
was
a
terrible
cracking
noise
the
frightened
workmen
ran
out
into
the
street
in
falling
the
wall
shook
and
carried
all
the
rest
with
it
no
doubt
the
hovel
with
its
flaws
and
cracks
was
ripe
for
this
downfall
a
push
had
sufficed
to
cleave
it
from
top
to
bottom
it
was
a
pitiful
crumbling
the
razing
of
a
soddened
by
rain
not
a
partition
remained
standing
on
the
ground
there
was
nothing
but
a
heap
of
rubbish
the
dung
of
the
past
cast
as
it
were
at
the
street
corner
my
god
the
old
man
had
exclaimed
as
if
the
blow
had
resounded
in
his
very
entrails
he
stood
there
gaping
he
would
never
have
imagined
that
it
would
have
been
so
quickly
over
and
he
looked
at
the
gap
the
hollow
at
last
yawning
beside
the
ladies
paradise
now
freed
of
the
wart
which
had
so
long
disgraced
it
the
gnat
was
crushed
this
was
the
final
triumph
over
the
galling
obstinacy
of
the
infinitely
little
the
whole
block
was
now
invaded
and
conquered
lingered
to
talk
to
the
workmen
who
began
crying
out
against
those
old
buildings
which
were
only
good
for
killing
people
monsieur
bourras
repeated
denise
trying
to
draw
him
on
one
side
you
know
that
you
will
not
be
abandoned
all
your
wants
will
be
provided
for
he
raised
his
head
i
have
no
wants
you
been
sent
by
them
you
well
tell
them
that
old
bourras
still
knows
how
to
use
his
hands
and
that
he
can
find
work
wherever
he
likes
really
it
would
be
a
fine
thing
to
offer
charity
to
those
whom
they
assassinate
then
she
implored
him
pray
accept
monsieur
bourras
do
cause
me
this
grief
but
he
shook
his
bushy
head
no
no
it
all
over
go
and
live
happily
you
who
are
young
and
do
prevent
old
people
from
sticking
to
their
ideas
he
cast
a
last
glance
at
the
heap
of
rubbish
and
then
went
painfully
away
she
watched
him
disappear
elbowed
by
the
crowd
on
the
pavement
he
turned
the
corner
of
the
place
gaillon
and
all
was
over
for
a
moment
denise
remained
motionless
lost
in
thought
then
she
went
over
to
her
uncle
the
draper
was
alone
in
the
dark
shop
of
the
old
elbeuf
the
charwoman
only
came
in
the
morning
and
evening
to
do
a
little
cooking
and
help
him
take
down
and
put
up
the
shutters
he
spent
hours
in
this
solitude
often
without
being
disturbed
during
the
whole
day
and
bewildered
and
unable
to
find
the
goods
when
a
stray
customer
chanced
to
venture
in
and
there
in
the
silence
and
the
he
walked
about
unceasingly
with
the
same
heavy
step
as
at
the
two
funerals
yielding
to
a
sickly
desire
to
regular
fits
of
forced
marching
as
if
he
were
trying
to
rock
his
grief
to
sleep
are
you
feeling
better
uncle
asked
denise
he
only
stopped
for
a
second
and
then
started
off
again
going
from
the
to
an
obscure
corner
yes
yes
very
well
thanks
she
tried
to
find
some
consoling
subject
some
cheerful
remark
but
could
think
of
nothing
did
you
hear
the
noise
the
house
is
down
ah
it
true
he
murmured
with
an
astonished
look
that
must
have
been
the
house
i
felt
the
ground
shake
seeing
them
on
the
roof
this
morning
i
closed
my
door
then
he
made
a
vague
gesture
to
intimate
that
such
things
no
longer
interested
him
each
time
he
arrived
in
front
of
the
he
looked
at
the
empty
seat
that
seat
where
his
wife
and
daughter
had
grown
up
then
when
his
perpetual
walking
brought
him
to
the
other
end
he
gazed
at
the
shelves
on
which
a
few
pieces
of
cloth
were
growing
more
and
more
mouldy
it
was
a
widowed
house
those
he
loved
had
disappeared
his
business
had
come
to
a
shameful
end
and
he
was
left
alone
to
commune
with
his
dead
heart
and
fallen
pride
amidst
all
these
catastrophes
he
raised
his
eyes
to
the
black
ceiling
he
listened
to
the
sepulchral
silence
which
reigned
in
the
little
that
family
nook
which
he
had
formerly
loved
so
well
even
to
its
stuffy
odour
not
a
breath
was
now
heard
in
the
old
house
his
regular
heavy
tread
made
the
ancient
walls
resound
as
if
he
were
walking
in
the
tomb
of
his
affections
at
last
denise
approached
the
subject
which
had
brought
her
uncle
said
she
you
ca
stay
like
this
you
must
come
to
a
decision
without
stopping
he
replied
no
doubt
but
what
would
you
have
me
do
i
tried
to
sell
but
no
one
has
come
one
of
these
mornings
i
shall
shut
up
shop
and
go
off
she
was
aware
that
a
failure
was
no
longer
to
be
feared
the
creditors
had
preferred
to
come
to
an
understanding
in
presence
of
such
a
long
series
of
misfortunes
everything
paid
the
old
man
would
simply
find
himself
in
the
street
penniless
but
what
will
you
do
then
she
murmured
seeking
some
transition
in
order
to
arrive
at
the
offer
which
she
dared
not
make
i
do
know
he
replied
they
pick
me
up
all
right
he
had
now
changed
his
route
going
from
the
to
the
windows
and
every
time
he
came
to
these
windows
he
cast
a
mournful
glance
on
the
wretchedness
of
the
old
forgotten
there
his
eyes
did
not
even
turn
towards
the
triumphal
façade
of
the
ladies
paradise
whose
architectural
lines
ran
right
and
left
to
both
ends
of
the
street
he
was
thoroughly
annihilated
and
had
not
even
the
strength
left
him
to
get
angry
listen
uncle
said
denise
at
last
greatly
embarrassed
perhaps
there
might
be
a
situation
for
you
and
after
a
pause
she
stammered
yes
i
am
charged
to
offer
you
a
situation
as
inspector
where
asked
baudu
why
over
the
road
she
replied
at
our
place
six
thousand
francs
a
year
a
very
easy
berth
he
stopped
suddenly
in
front
of
her
but
instead
of
getting
angry
as
she
feared
he
would
he
turned
very
pale
succumbing
to
a
grievous
emotion
a
feeling
of
bitter
resignation
over
the
road
over
the
road
he
stammered
several
times
you
want
me
to
go
there
denise
herself
was
affected
by
his
emotion
she
recalled
the
long
struggle
of
the
two
shops
again
saw
herself
at
the
funerals
of
geneviève
and
madame
baudu
and
beheld
the
old
elbeuf
overthrown
utterly
ruined
by
the
ladies
paradise
and
the
idea
of
her
uncle
taking
a
situation
over
the
road
and
walking
about
there
in
a
white
made
her
heart
leap
with
pity
and
revolt
come
denise
my
girl
is
it
possible
he
asked
simply
crossing
his
poor
trembling
hands
no
no
uncle
she
exclaimed
in
a
sudden
outburst
of
her
just
and
excellent
nature
it
would
be
wrong
forgive
me
i
beg
of
you
he
resumed
his
walk
and
again
his
step
resounded
amidst
the
funereal
emptiness
of
the
house
and
when
she
left
him
he
was
still
and
ever
marching
up
and
down
with
the
obstinate
locomotion
peculiar
to
great
despairs
which
turn
and
turn
unable
to
find
an
outlet
that
night
also
proved
a
sleepless
one
for
denise
she
had
discovered
she
really
was
powerless
even
in
favour
of
her
own
people
she
was
unable
to
find
any
consolation
or
relief
she
must
to
the
bitter
end
remain
a
witness
of
the
invincible
work
of
life
which
requires
death
as
its
continual
seed
she
no
longer
struggled
she
accepted
this
law
of
combat
still
her
womanly
soul
filled
with
tearful
pity
with
fraternal
tenderness
at
the
idea
of
humanity
sufferings
for
years
past
she
herself
had
been
caught
in
the
of
the
machine
had
she
not
bled
in
it
had
she
not
been
bruised
dismissed
overwhelmed
with
insults
even
now
she
was
frightened
when
she
felt
herself
chosen
by
the
logic
of
facts
why
should
it
be
she
who
was
so
puny
why
should
her
small
hand
suddenly
become
so
powerful
amidst
the
work
and
the
force
which
swept
everything
away
carried
her
along
in
her
turn
she
whose
coming
was
to
be
revenge
it
was
mouret
who
had
invented
this
mechanism
whose
brutal
working
shocked
her
he
had
strewn
the
neighbourhood
with
ruins
despoiled
some
killed
others
and
yet
despite
everything
she
loved
him
for
the
grandeur
of
his
work
loved
him
still
more
at
each
fresh
excess
of
power
notwithstanding
the
flood
of
tears
which
overcame
her
in
presence
of
the
hallowed
wretchedness
of
the
vanquished
chapter
xiv
the
rue
du
quite
new
with
its
houses
and
the
last
remaining
scaffoldings
of
a
few
unfinished
buildings
stretched
out
beneath
a
clear
february
sun
a
stream
of
vehicles
was
passing
at
a
conquering
pace
through
this
gap
of
light
intersecting
the
damp
gloom
of
the
old
quarter
and
between
the
rue
de
la
michodière
and
the
rue
de
choiseul
there
was
quite
a
tumult
the
crush
of
a
crowd
of
people
who
had
been
excited
by
a
month
advertising
and
with
their
eyes
in
the
air
were
gaping
at
the
monumental
façade
of
the
paradise
inaugurated
that
monday
on
the
occasion
of
a
grand
display
of
white
goods
there
was
a
vast
development
of
bright
fresh
polychromatic
architecture
enriched
with
gilding
symbolical
of
the
tumult
and
sparkle
of
the
business
inside
and
attracting
attention
like
a
gigantic
flaming
with
the
liveliest
colours
in
order
not
to
bedim
the
show
of
goods
the
decoration
was
of
a
sober
description
the
base
of
marble
the
corner
piers
and
bearing
pillars
covered
with
black
marble
the
severity
of
which
was
brightened
by
gilded
modillions
and
all
the
rest
was
in
iron
sashes
nothing
but
glass
which
seemed
to
throw
the
depths
of
the
halls
and
galleries
open
to
the
full
light
of
day
however
as
the
floors
ascended
the
hues
became
brighter
the
frieze
above
the
was
formed
of
a
series
of
mosaics
a
garland
of
red
and
blue
flowers
alternating
with
marble
slabs
on
which
was
cut
an
infinity
of
names
of
goods
encircling
the
colossus
then
the
base
of
the
first
floor
of
enamelled
brickwork
supported
large
windows
above
which
came
another
frieze
formed
of
gilded
escutcheons
emblazoned
with
the
arms
of
the
chief
towns
of
france
and
designs
in
in
whose
enamel
one
again
found
the
light
coloured
tints
of
the
base
then
right
at
the
top
the
entablature
blossomed
forth
like
an
ardent
florescence
of
the
entire
façade
mosaics
and
faience
reappeared
with
yet
warmer
colourings
the
zinc
of
the
eaves
was
cut
and
gilded
while
along
the
acroteria
ran
a
nation
of
statues
emblematical
of
the
great
industrial
and
manufacturing
cities
their
delicate
silhouettes
profiled
against
the
sky
the
spectators
were
especially
astonished
by
the
central
entrance
which
was
also
decorated
with
a
profusion
of
mosaics
faience
and
and
surmounted
by
a
freshly
gilt
allegorical
group
which
glittered
in
the
sun
woman
garmented
and
kissed
by
a
flight
of
laughing
cupids
about
two
a
special
squad
of
police
was
obliged
to
make
the
crowd
move
on
and
to
regulate
the
waiting
carriages
the
palace
was
built
the
temple
raised
to
the
extravagant
folly
of
fashion
it
dominated
everything
covering
a
whole
district
with
its
shadows
the
scar
left
on
its
flank
by
the
demolition
of
bourras
hovel
had
already
been
so
skilfully
cicatrized
that
it
would
now
have
been
impossible
to
find
the
former
place
of
that
old
wart
in
their
superb
isolation
the
four
frontages
now
ran
along
the
four
streets
without
a
break
since
baudu
retirement
into
a
home
the
old
elbeuf
on
the
other
side
of
the
way
had
been
closed
walled
up
like
a
tomb
behind
the
shutters
that
were
never
now
taken
down
little
by
little
had
splashed
them
while
posters
a
rising
tide
of
advertisements
which
seemed
like
the
last
shovelful
of
earth
thrown
over
commerce
covered
them
up
and
pasted
them
together
and
in
the
middle
of
this
dead
frontage
dirtied
by
the
mud
from
the
street
and
streaked
with
tatters
of
parisian
puffery
a
huge
clean
yellow
poster
announcing
in
letters
two
feet
high
the
great
sale
at
the
ladies
paradise
was
displayed
like
a
flag
planted
on
a
conquered
empire
it
was
as
if
the
colossus
after
each
enlargement
full
of
shame
and
repugnance
for
the
dingy
district
in
which
it
had
modestly
sprung
up
and
which
it
had
subsequently
slaughtered
had
just
turned
its
back
to
it
leaving
the
mud
of
the
narrow
streets
behind
and
presenting
its
upstart
face
to
the
noisy
sunny
thoroughfares
of
new
paris
as
now
represented
in
the
engravings
of
its
advertisements
it
had
grown
bigger
and
bigger
like
the
ogre
of
the
legend
whose
shoulders
threatened
to
pierce
the
clouds
in
the
first
place
in
the
foreground
of
one
engraving
were
the
rue
du
the
rue
de
la
michodière
and
the
rue
monsigny
filled
with
little
black
figures
and
endowed
with
wondrous
breadth
as
if
to
make
room
for
the
customers
of
the
whole
world
then
came
a
bird
eye
view
of
the
buildings
themselves
of
exaggerated
immensity
with
the
roofs
of
the
covered
galleries
the
glazed
courtyards
in
which
the
halls
could
be
divined
all
the
infinitude
of
that
lake
of
glass
and
zinc
shining
in
the
sun
beyond
stretched
paris
but
a
paris
dwarfed
eaten
away
by
the
monster
the
houses
of
humbleness
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
faded
into
a
cloud
of
indistinct
chimneys
the
public
buildings
seemed
to
melt
into
nothingness
on
the
left
two
dashes
sufficed
for
to
the
right
a
circumflex
accent
represented
the
invalides
in
the
background
the
panthéon
looked
no
larger
than
a
lentil
the
horizon
crumbled
into
powder
became
no
more
than
a
contemptible
extending
past
the
heights
of
châtillon
out
into
the
open
country
whose
blurred
expanses
indicated
how
far
extended
the
state
of
slavery
ever
since
the
morning
the
crowd
had
been
increasing
no
establishment
had
ever
yet
stirred
up
the
city
with
such
an
uproarious
profusion
of
advertisements
the
ladies
paradise
now
spent
nearly
six
hundred
thousand
francs
a
year
in
posters
advertisements
and
appeals
of
all
sorts
four
hundred
thousand
catalogues
were
sent
away
more
than
a
hundred
thousand
francs
worth
of
material
was
cut
up
for
patterns
it
was
a
complete
invasion
of
the
newspapers
the
walls
and
the
ears
of
the
public
as
if
some
monstrous
brass
trumpet
were
being
blown
incessantly
carrying
the
tumult
of
the
great
sales
to
the
four
corners
of
the
earth
and
for
the
future
this
façade
before
which
people
were
now
crowding
became
a
living
advertisement
with
its
motley
gilded
magnificence
its
windows
large
enough
for
the
display
of
the
entire
poem
of
woman
dress
and
its
profusion
of
inscriptions
painted
engraved
and
cut
in
stone
from
the
marble
slabs
of
the
to
the
sheets
of
iron
rounded
off
in
semicircles
above
the
roofs
and
unfolding
gilded
streamers
on
which
the
name
of
the
house
could
be
read
in
letters
bright
as
the
sun
against
the
azure
blue
of
the
sky
trophies
and
flags
had
been
added
in
honour
of
the
inauguration
each
storey
was
gay
with
banners
and
standards
bearing
the
arms
of
the
principal
towns
of
france
and
right
at
the
top
the
flags
of
foreign
nations
run
up
on
masts
fluttered
in
the
breeze
down
below
the
show
of
white
goods
in
the
windows
flashed
with
blinding
intensity
there
was
nothing
but
white
on
the
left
a
complete
trousseau
and
a
mountain
of
sheets
on
the
right
some
curtains
draped
to
imitate
a
chapel
and
numerous
pyramids
of
handkerchiefs
fatigued
the
eyes
while
between
the
hung
goods
at
the
door
pieces
of
cotton
calico
and
muslin
falling
and
spreading
out
like
snow
from
a
mountain
summit
were
placed
some
dressed
prints
sheets
of
bluish
cardboard
on
which
a
young
bride
and
a
lady
in
ball
costume
both
and
attired
in
real
lace
and
silk
smiled
with
their
coloured
faces
a
group
of
idlers
was
constantly
forming
there
and
desire
arose
from
the
admiration
of
the
throng
moreover
the
curiosity
around
the
ladies
paradise
was
increased
by
a
catastrophe
of
which
all
paris
was
talking
the
burning
down
of
the
four
seasons
the
big
establishment
which
bouthemont
had
opened
near
the
hardly
three
weeks
before
the
newspapers
were
full
of
details
the
fire
breaking
out
through
an
explosion
of
gas
during
the
night
the
hurried
flight
of
the
frightened
saleswomen
in
their
and
the
heroic
conduct
of
bouthemont
who
had
carried
five
of
them
out
on
his
shoulders
the
enormous
losses
were
covered
by
insurances
and
people
had
already
begun
to
shrug
their
shoulders
saying
what
a
splendid
advertisement
it
was
but
for
the
time
being
attention
again
flowed
back
to
the
ladies
paradise
excited
by
all
the
stories
which
were
flying
about
occupied
to
a
wonderful
extent
by
these
colossal
establishments
which
by
their
importance
were
taking
up
such
a
large
place
in
public
life
how
wonderfully
lucky
that
mouret
was
paris
saluted
her
star
and
crowded
to
see
him
still
standing
erect
since
the
very
flames
now
undertook
to
sweep
all
competition
from
before
him
and
the
profits
of
his
season
were
already
being
calculated
people
had
begun
to
estimate
the
increase
of
custom
which
would
be
brought
to
his
doors
by
the
forced
closing
of
the
rival
house
for
a
moment
he
had
been
anxious
troubled
at
feeling
a
jealous
woman
against
him
that
madame
desforges
to
whom
he
owed
some
part
of
his
fortune
baron
hartmann
financial
dilettantism
in
putting
money
into
both
concerns
annoyed
him
also
then
he
was
above
all
exasperated
at
having
missed
a
genial
idea
which
had
occurred
to
bouthemont
who
had
prevailed
on
the
vicar
of
the
madeleine
to
bless
his
establishment
followed
by
all
his
clergy
an
astonishing
ceremony
a
religious
pomp
paraded
from
the
silk
department
to
the
glove
department
and
so
on
throughout
the
building
true
this
ceremony
had
not
prevented
everything
from
being
destroyed
but
it
had
done
as
much
good
as
a
million
francs
worth
of
advertisements
so
great
an
impression
had
it
produced
on
the
fashionable
world
from
that
day
mouret
dreamed
of
securing
the
services
of
the
archbishop
the
clock
over
the
door
was
striking
three
and
the
afternoon
crush
had
commenced
nearly
a
hundred
thousand
customers
struggling
in
the
various
galleries
and
halls
outside
the
vehicles
were
stationed
from
one
to
the
other
end
of
the
rue
du
and
over
against
the
another
compact
mass
of
conveyances
occupied
the
where
the
future
avenue
de
was
to
commence
public
cabs
mixed
with
private
broughams
the
drivers
waiting
about
the
wheels
and
the
horses
neighing
and
shaking
their
which
sparkled
in
the
sun
the
lines
were
incessantly
reforming
amidst
the
calls
of
the
messengers
and
the
pushing
of
the
animals
which
closed
in
of
their
own
accord
whilst
fresh
vehicles
kept
on
arriving
and
taking
their
places
with
the
rest
the
pedestrians
flew
on
to
the
refuges
in
frightened
bands
the
foot
pavements
appeared
black
with
people
in
the
receding
perspective
of
the
broad
straight
thoroughfare
and
a
clamour
rose
up
between
the
white
houses
a
mighty
caressing
breath
swept
along
as
though
paris
were
opening
her
soul
madame
de
boves
accompanied
by
her
daughter
blanche
and
madame
guibal
was
standing
at
a
window
looking
at
a
display
of
costumes
composed
of
skirts
with
the
necessary
material
for
bodices
oh
do
look
said
she
at
those
print
costumes
at
nineteen
francs
fifteen
sous
in
their
square
pasteboard
boxes
lay
the
costumes
each
tied
round
with
a
favour
and
folded
so
as
to
show
the
blue
and
red
embroidered
trimmings
and
in
a
corner
of
each
box
was
an
engraving
depicting
the
garment
completed
as
worn
by
a
young
person
resembling
some
princess
but
they
are
not
worth
more
murmured
madame
guibal
they
fall
to
pieces
as
soon
as
you
handle
them
the
two
women
had
become
quite
intimate
since
monsieur
de
boves
had
been
confined
to
his
by
an
attack
of
gout
his
wife
put
up
with
the
acquaintance
since
in
this
way
she
picked
up
a
little
pocket
money
sums
that
the
husband
allowed
himself
to
be
robbed
of
being
also
in
need
of
forbearance
well
let
go
in
resumed
madame
guibal
we
must
see
their
show
has
your
made
an
appointment
with
you
inside
madame
de
boves
did
not
reply
being
absorbed
in
contemplation
of
the
string
of
carriages
whose
doors
one
by
one
opened
and
gave
egress
to
more
customers
yes
said
blanche
at
last
in
her
indolent
voice
paul
is
to
join
us
at
about
four
in
the
on
leaving
the
ministry
they
had
been
married
about
a
month
and
vallagnosc
after
a
three
weeks
leave
of
absence
spent
in
the
south
of
france
had
just
returned
to
his
post
the
young
woman
already
had
her
mother
portly
appearance
her
flesh
seemed
to
be
more
puffy
and
coarse
since
her
marriage
but
there
madame
desforges
over
there
exclaimed
the
countess
looking
at
a
brougham
that
had
just
pulled
up
do
you
think
so
murmured
madame
guibal
after
all
those
stories
she
must
still
be
weeping
over
the
fire
at
the
four
seasons
however
it
was
indeed
henriette
on
perceiving
her
friends
she
came
up
with
a
gay
smiling
air
concealing
her
defeat
beneath
the
fashionable
ease
of
her
manner
dear
me
yes
i
wanted
to
have
a
look
round
it
better
to
see
for
one
self
is
it
oh
we
are
still
good
friends
with
monsieur
mouret
though
he
is
said
to
be
furious
since
i
interested
myself
in
that
rival
establishment
personally
there
is
only
one
thing
i
can
not
forgive
him
and
that
is
to
have
urged
on
the
marriage
of
my
protégée
mademoiselle
de
fontenailles
with
that
joseph
what
it
done
interrupted
madame
de
boves
what
a
horror
yes
my
dear
and
solely
to
annoy
us
i
know
him
he
wished
to
intimate
that
the
daughters
of
our
great
families
are
only
fit
to
marry
his
shop
messengers
she
was
getting
quite
animated
they
had
all
four
remained
on
the
pavement
amidst
the
crush
at
the
entrance
little
by
little
however
they
were
caught
by
the
stream
and
only
had
to
yield
to
the
current
to
pass
the
door
without
being
conscious
of
it
talking
louder
the
while
in
order
to
make
themselves
heard
they
were
now
asking
each
other
about
madame
marty
it
was
said
that
poor
monsieur
marty
after
some
violent
scenes
at
home
had
gone
quite
mad
believing
himself
endowed
with
unexhaustible
wealth
he
was
ever
diving
into
the
treasures
of
the
earth
exhausting
mines
of
gold
and
loading
tumbrils
with
diamonds
and
precious
stones
poor
old
fellow
said
madame
guibal
he
who
was
always
so
shabby
with
his
teacher
humility
and
the
wife
she
ruining
an
uncle
now
replied
henriette
a
worthy
old
man
who
has
gone
to
live
with
her
since
losing
his
wife
but
she
must
be
here
we
shall
see
her
surprise
however
made
the
ladies
stop
short
before
them
extended
the
largest
shops
in
the
world
as
the
advertisements
said
the
grand
central
gallery
now
ran
from
end
to
end
opening
on
to
both
the
rue
du
and
the
rue
whilst
to
the
right
and
the
left
similar
to
the
aisles
of
a
church
the
narrower
monsigny
and
michodière
galleries
extended
along
the
two
side
streets
without
a
break
here
and
there
the
halls
formed
open
spaces
amidst
the
metallic
framework
of
the
spiral
staircases
and
hanging
bridges
the
inside
arrangements
had
been
all
changed
the
bargains
were
now
placed
on
the
rue
du
side
the
silk
department
was
in
the
centre
the
glove
department
occupied
the
hall
at
the
far
end
and
from
the
new
grand
vestibule
you
beheld
on
looking
up
the
bedding
department
which
had
been
moved
from
one
to
the
other
end
of
the
second
floor
the
number
of
departments
now
amounted
to
the
enormous
total
of
fifty
several
quite
fresh
were
being
inaugurated
that
very
day
others
which
had
become
too
important
had
simply
been
divided
in
order
to
facilitate
the
sales
and
owing
to
the
continual
increase
of
business
the
staff
had
been
increased
to
three
thousand
and
employees
for
the
new
season
what
caused
the
ladies
to
stop
was
the
prodigious
spectacle
presented
by
the
grand
exhibition
of
white
goods
in
the
first
place
there
was
the
vestibule
a
hall
with
bright
mirrors
and
paved
with
mosaics
where
the
goods
detained
the
voracious
crowd
then
the
galleries
opened
displaying
a
glittering
blaze
of
white
a
borealistic
vista
a
country
of
snow
with
endless
steppes
hung
with
ermine
and
an
accumulation
of
glaciers
shimmering
in
the
sun
you
here
again
found
the
whiteness
of
the
show
windows
but
vivified
and
burning
from
one
end
of
the
enormous
building
to
the
other
with
the
white
flame
of
a
fire
in
full
swing
there
was
nothing
but
white
goods
all
the
white
articles
from
each
department
a
riot
of
white
a
white
constellation
whose
fixed
radiance
was
at
first
blinding
so
that
details
could
not
be
distinguished
however
the
eye
soon
became
accustomed
to
this
unique
whiteness
to
the
left
in
the
monsigny
gallery
white
promontories
of
cotton
and
calico
jutted
out
with
white
rocks
formed
of
sheets
napkins
and
handkerchiefs
whilst
to
the
right
in
the
michodière
gallery
occupied
by
the
mercery
the
hosiery
and
the
woollen
goods
were
erections
of
mother
of
pearl
buttons
a
grand
decoration
composed
of
white
socks
and
one
whole
room
covered
with
white
swanskin
illumined
by
a
stream
of
light
from
the
distance
but
the
greatest
radiance
of
this
nucleus
of
light
came
from
the
central
gallery
from
amidst
the
ribbons
and
the
neckerchiefs
the
gloves
and
the
silks
the
counters
disappeared
beneath
the
whiteness
of
the
silks
the
ribbons
the
gloves
and
the
neckerchiefs
round
the
iron
columns
climbed
puffings
of
white
muslin
secured
now
and
again
with
white
silk
handkerchiefs
the
staircases
were
decorated
with
white
draperies
quiltings
and
dimities
alternating
along
the
balustrades
and
encircling
the
halls
as
high
as
the
second
storey
and
all
this
ascending
whiteness
assumed
wings
hurried
off
and
wandered
away
like
a
flight
of
swans
and
more
white
hung
from
the
arches
a
fall
of
down
a
sheet
of
large
snowy
flakes
white
counterpanes
white
coverlets
hovered
in
the
air
like
banners
in
a
church
long
jets
of
guipure
lace
hung
across
suggestive
of
swarms
of
white
motionless
butterflies
other
laces
fluttered
on
all
sides
floating
like
gossamer
in
a
summer
sky
filling
the
air
with
their
white
breath
and
the
marvel
the
altar
of
this
religion
of
white
was
a
tent
formed
of
white
curtains
which
hung
from
the
glazed
roof
above
the
silk
counter
in
the
great
hall
the
muslin
the
gauze
the
flowed
in
light
ripples
whilst
very
richly
embroidered
tulles
and
pieces
of
oriental
silk
served
as
a
background
to
this
giant
decoration
which
partook
both
of
the
tabernacle
and
the
alcove
it
was
like
a
broad
white
bed
awaiting
with
its
virginal
immensity
as
in
the
legend
the
coming
of
the
white
princess
she
who
was
to
appear
some
day
all
powerful
in
her
white
bridal
veil
oh
extraordinary
repeated
the
ladies
wonderful
they
did
not
weary
of
this
song
in
praise
of
whiteness
which
the
goods
of
the
entire
establishment
were
singing
mouret
had
never
conceived
anything
more
vast
it
was
the
master
stroke
of
his
genius
for
display
beneath
the
flow
of
all
this
whiteness
amidst
the
seeming
disorder
of
the
tissues
fallen
as
if
by
chance
from
the
open
drawers
there
was
so
to
say
a
harmonious
phrase
white
followed
and
developed
in
all
its
tones
springing
into
existence
growing
and
blossoming
with
the
complicated
orchestration
of
some
master
fugue
the
continuous
development
of
which
carries
the
mind
away
in
an
flight
nothing
but
white
and
yet
never
the
same
white
each
different
tinge
showing
against
the
other
contrasting
with
that
next
to
it
or
perfecting
it
and
attaining
to
the
very
brilliancy
of
light
itself
it
all
began
with
the
dead
white
of
calico
and
linen
and
the
dull
white
of
flannel
and
cloth
then
came
the
velvets
silks
and
satins
quite
an
ascending
gamut
the
white
gradually
lighting
up
and
finally
emitting
little
flashes
at
its
folds
and
then
it
flew
away
in
the
transparencies
of
the
curtains
became
diffuse
brightness
with
the
muslins
the
guipures
the
laces
and
especially
the
tulles
so
light
and
airy
that
they
formed
the
extreme
final
note
whilst
the
silver
of
the
oriental
silk
sounded
higher
than
all
else
in
the
depths
of
the
giant
alcove
meanwhile
the
place
was
full
of
life
the
lifts
were
besieged
by
people
there
was
a
crush
at
the
and
in
the
quite
a
nation
was
moving
about
in
these
snowy
regions
and
the
crowd
seemed
to
be
black
like
skaters
on
a
polish
lake
in
december
on
the
there
was
a
heavy
swell
ruffled
by
a
reflux
in
which
nothing
but
the
delicate
enraptured
faces
of
women
could
be
distinguished
in
the
gaps
of
the
iron
framework
up
the
staircases
on
the
hanging
bridges
there
was
an
endless
ascent
of
small
figures
which
looked
as
if
lost
amidst
the
snowy
peaks
of
mountains
a
suffocating
heat
surprised
one
at
sight
of
these
frozen
heights
the
buzz
of
all
the
voices
made
a
great
noise
like
that
of
a
river
carrying
ice
along
up
above
the
profusion
of
gilding
the
glass
work
and
the
golden
roses
seemed
like
a
burst
of
sunshine
glittering
over
the
alps
of
this
grand
exhibition
of
white
goods
come
said
madame
de
boves
we
must
go
forward
it
impossible
to
stay
here
since
she
had
entered
inspector
jouve
standing
near
the
door
had
not
taken
his
eyes
off
her
and
when
she
turned
round
she
encountered
his
gaze
then
as
she
resumed
her
walk
he
let
her
gain
ground
but
followed
her
at
a
distance
without
however
appearing
to
take
any
further
notice
of
her
ah
said
madame
guibal
again
stopping
amidst
all
the
jostling
as
she
came
to
the
first
that
a
pretty
idea
those
violets
she
referred
to
the
new
present
made
by
the
ladies
paradise
one
of
mouret
ideas
which
was
making
a
great
noise
in
the
newspapers
small
bouquets
of
white
violets
bought
by
the
thousand
at
nice
were
distributed
to
every
lady
customer
who
made
the
smallest
purchase
near
each
messengers
in
uniform
stood
delivering
the
bouquets
under
the
supervision
of
an
inspector
and
gradually
all
the
customers
were
decorated
in
this
way
the
building
was
filling
with
these
white
bridal
flowers
every
woman
diffusing
as
she
passed
a
penetrating
perfume
of
violets
yes
murmured
madame
desforges
in
a
jealous
voice
it
a
good
idea
but
just
as
they
were
moving
away
they
heard
two
salesmen
joking
about
these
violets
a
tall
thin
fellow
was
expressing
his
astonishment
was
the
marriage
between
the
governor
and
the
in
the
costume
department
coming
off
then
whilst
a
short
fat
fellow
replied
that
he
did
know
but
that
the
flowers
were
bought
at
any
rate
what
exclaimed
madame
de
boves
is
monsieur
mouret
going
to
marry
that
the
latest
news
replied
madame
desforges
affecting
the
greatest
indifference
however
one
bound
to
come
to
that
the
countess
darted
a
quick
glance
at
her
new
friend
they
both
now
understood
why
madame
desforges
had
come
to
the
ladies
paradise
notwithstanding
the
hostilities
attending
her
rupture
with
mouret
no
doubt
she
was
yielding
to
an
invincible
desire
to
see
and
suffer
i
shall
stay
with
you
said
madame
guibal
whose
curiosity
was
awakened
we
can
meet
madame
de
boves
again
in
the
very
good
replied
the
latter
i
want
to
go
up
to
the
first
floor
come
along
blanche
and
she
went
up
followed
by
her
daughter
whilst
inspector
jouve
still
on
her
track
ascended
by
another
staircase
in
order
not
to
attract
her
attention
the
two
other
ladies
soon
disappeared
in
the
compact
crowd
on
the
amidst
the
press
of
business
all
the
counters
were
again
talking
of
nothing
but
the
governor
love
matters
the
affair
which
had
for
months
been
occupying
the
employees
who
were
delighted
at
long
resistance
had
all
at
once
come
to
a
crisis
since
the
previous
day
it
had
been
known
that
the
girl
intended
to
leave
the
paradise
under
the
pretext
of
requiring
rest
and
this
despite
all
mouret
entreaties
and
opinions
were
divided
would
she
leave
would
she
stay
bets
of
five
francs
that
she
would
leave
on
the
following
sunday
circulated
from
department
to
department
the
knowing
ones
staked
a
lunch
on
it
all
ending
in
a
marriage
yet
the
others
those
who
believed
in
her
departure
did
not
risk
their
money
without
good
reasons
certainly
the
girl
had
all
the
power
of
an
adored
woman
who
refuses
to
yield
but
the
governor
on
his
side
was
strong
in
his
wealth
his
happy
widowerhood
and
his
pride
which
a
last
exaction
might
exasperate
at
all
events
they
were
all
of
opinion
that
this
little
saleswoman
had
played
her
game
with
the
science
of
a
expert
woman
of
the
world
and
was
now
venturing
on
the
supreme
stroke
by
offering
him
this
bargain
marry
me
or
i
go
denise
however
thought
but
little
of
these
things
she
had
never
imposed
any
conditions
or
made
any
calculation
and
the
reason
of
her
departure
was
the
very
judgment
which
to
her
continual
surprise
was
passed
upon
her
conduct
had
she
wished
for
all
this
had
she
shown
herself
artful
coquettish
ambitious
no
she
had
simply
presented
herself
and
had
been
the
first
to
feel
astonished
at
such
a
passion
and
again
at
the
present
time
why
did
they
ascribe
her
resolution
to
quit
the
ladies
paradise
to
craftiness
it
was
after
all
so
natural
she
had
begun
to
experience
a
nervous
uneasiness
an
intolerable
anguish
amidst
the
continual
gossip
which
went
on
in
the
house
and
mouret
feverish
pursuit
of
her
and
the
combats
she
was
obliged
to
wage
against
herself
and
she
preferred
to
go
away
seized
with
fear
lest
she
might
some
day
yield
and
regret
it
for
ever
afterwards
if
in
all
this
there
were
any
learned
tactics
she
was
totally
unaware
of
it
and
she
asked
herself
in
despair
what
she
might
do
to
avoid
appearing
like
one
who
is
running
after
a
husband
the
idea
of
a
marriage
now
irritated
her
and
she
resolved
to
say
no
and
still
no
should
he
push
his
folly
to
that
extent
she
alone
ought
to
suffer
the
necessity
for
the
separation
caused
her
tears
to
flow
but
with
her
great
courage
she
repeated
that
it
was
necessary
that
she
would
have
no
rest
or
happiness
if
she
acted
in
any
other
way
when
mouret
received
her
resignation
he
remained
mute
and
cold
in
the
effort
which
he
made
to
contain
himself
then
he
curtly
replied
that
he
granted
her
a
week
reflection
before
allowing
her
to
commit
such
a
stupid
action
at
the
expiration
of
the
week
when
she
returned
to
the
subject
and
expressed
a
determination
to
go
away
after
the
great
sale
he
did
not
lose
his
temper
but
affected
to
talk
the
language
of
reason
to
her
she
was
playing
with
fortune
she
would
never
find
another
position
equal
to
that
she
was
leaving
had
she
another
situation
in
view
if
so
he
was
quite
prepared
to
offer
her
the
advantages
she
expected
to
obtain
elsewhere
and
when
the
young
woman
replied
that
she
had
not
looked
for
any
other
situation
but
intended
first
of
all
to
take
a
rest
at
valognes
thanks
to
the
money
she
had
already
saved
he
asked
her
what
would
prevent
her
from
returning
to
the
ladies
paradise
if
her
health
alone
were
the
reason
of
her
departure
she
remained
silent
tortured
by
this
and
thereupon
he
imagined
that
she
was
about
to
join
a
sweetheart
a
future
husband
perhaps
had
she
not
confessed
to
him
one
evening
that
she
loved
somebody
from
that
moment
he
had
been
carrying
deep
in
his
heart
like
the
stab
of
a
knife
the
confession
wrung
from
her
and
if
this
man
was
to
marry
her
she
must
be
giving
up
all
to
follow
him
that
explained
her
obstinacy
it
was
all
over
and
so
he
simply
added
in
an
icy
tone
that
he
would
detain
her
no
longer
since
she
could
not
tell
him
the
real
cause
of
her
departure
these
harsh
words
free
from
anger
upset
her
far
more
than
a
violent
scene
such
as
she
had
feared
throughout
the
remaining
week
which
denise
was
obliged
to
spend
in
the
house
mouret
preserved
his
rigid
pallor
when
he
crossed
the
departments
he
affected
not
to
see
her
never
had
he
seemed
more
indifferent
more
absorbed
in
his
work
and
the
bets
began
again
only
the
brave
ones
dared
to
risk
a
luncheon
on
the
wedding
yet
beneath
this
coldness
so
unusual
with
him
mouret
hid
a
frightful
attack
of
indecision
and
suffering
fits
of
anger
brought
the
blood
seething
to
his
head
he
saw
red
he
dreamed
of
taking
denise
in
a
close
embrace
keeping
her
and
stifling
her
cries
then
he
tried
to
reflect
to
find
some
practical
means
of
preventing
her
from
going
away
but
he
constantly
ran
up
against
his
powerlessness
the
uselessness
of
his
power
and
money
an
idea
however
was
growing
amidst
his
wild
projects
and
gradually
imposing
itself
on
him
notwithstanding
his
revolt
after
madame
hédouin
death
he
had
sworn
never
to
marry
again
having
derived
from
a
woman
his
first
good
fortune
he
resolved
in
future
to
draw
his
fortune
from
all
women
it
was
with
him
as
with
bourdoncle
a
superstition
that
the
head
of
a
great
drapery
establishment
ought
to
remain
single
if
he
wished
to
retain
his
masculine
sovereignty
over
the
growing
desires
of
his
world
of
female
customers
for
the
introduction
of
a
woman
to
the
throne
would
change
the
atmosphere
drive
away
all
the
others
thus
he
still
resisted
the
invincible
logic
of
facts
preferring
to
die
rather
than
yield
and
inflamed
by
sudden
bursts
of
fury
against
denise
feeling
that
she
was
revenge
and
fearing
he
should
fall
vanquished
upon
his
millions
broken
like
a
mere
straw
by
the
eternal
feminine
on
the
day
he
should
marry
her
then
however
he
would
become
cowardly
again
and
discuss
his
repugnance
why
should
he
tremble
she
was
so
so
prudent
that
he
could
abandon
himself
to
her
without
fear
twenty
times
an
hour
the
battle
began
afresh
in
his
distracted
mind
his
pride
tended
to
irritate
the
wound
and
he
completely
lost
his
reason
when
he
thought
that
even
after
this
last
submission
she
might
yet
say
no
ever
no
if
she
loved
another
on
the
morning
of
the
great
sale
he
had
still
not
decided
on
anything
and
denise
was
to
leave
on
the
morrow
when
bourdoncle
on
the
day
in
question
entered
mouret
private
room
at
about
three
according
to
custom
he
found
him
sitting
with
his
elbows
on
his
desk
his
hands
over
his
eyes
so
greatly
absorbed
that
he
had
to
touch
him
on
the
shoulder
then
mouret
glanced
up
his
face
bathed
in
tears
they
looked
at
each
other
held
out
their
hands
and
a
hearty
grip
was
exchanged
by
these
two
men
who
had
fought
so
many
commercial
battles
side
by
side
for
the
past
month
moreover
bourdoncle
manner
had
completely
changed
he
now
bent
before
denise
and
even
secretly
urged
the
governor
on
to
a
marriage
with
her
no
doubt
he
was
thus
manœuvring
to
save
himself
from
being
swept
away
by
a
power
which
he
now
recognised
as
superior
but
beneath
this
change
there
could
also
have
been
found
the
awakening
of
an
old
ambition
a
timid
gradually
growing
hope
of
in
his
turn
swallowing
up
that
mouret
before
whom
he
had
so
long
bowed
this
was
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
house
in
the
struggle
for
existence
whose
continued
massacres
helped
on
the
sales
around
him
he
was
carried
away
by
the
working
of
the
machine
seized
by
the
same
appetite
as
the
others
that
voracity
which
from
top
to
bottom
urged
the
lean
ones
to
the
extermination
of
the
fat
ones
only
a
sort
of
religious
fear
the
religion
of
chance
had
so
far
prevented
him
from
showing
his
own
teeth
but
now
the
governor
was
becoming
childish
drifting
into
a
ridiculous
marriage
ruining
his
luck
destroying
his
charm
over
the
customers
why
should
he
dissuade
him
from
it
when
he
might
afterwards
so
easily
pick
up
the
business
of
this
weakling
who
fell
at
the
feet
of
a
woman
thus
it
was
with
the
emotion
of
a
farewell
the
pity
of
an
old
friendship
that
he
shook
his
chief
hand
saying
come
come
courage
marry
her
and
finish
the
matter
but
mouret
already
felt
ashamed
of
his
momentary
weakness
and
got
up
protesting
no
no
it
too
stupid
come
let
take
a
turn
round
the
place
things
are
looking
well
are
they
i
fancy
we
shall
have
a
magnificent
day
they
went
out
and
began
their
afternoon
inspection
of
the
crowded
departments
bourdoncle
meanwhile
cast
side
glances
at
his
companion
feeling
anxious
at
this
last
display
of
energy
and
watching
his
lips
to
catch
the
least
sign
of
suffering
the
business
was
now
throwing
forth
its
fire
with
an
infernal
roar
which
made
the
building
tremble
like
a
big
steamer
going
at
full
speed
at
denise
counter
was
a
crowd
of
mothers
with
bands
of
little
girls
and
boys
swamped
beneath
the
garments
they
were
trying
on
the
department
had
brought
out
all
its
white
articles
and
there
as
everywhere
else
was
a
riot
of
white
fit
for
the
garmenting
of
a
troop
of
shivering
cupids
white
cloth
cloaks
white
piqué
nainsook
and
cashmere
dresses
white
sailor
costumes
and
even
white
zouave
ones
in
the
centre
for
the
sake
of
effect
for
the
proper
season
had
not
yet
arrived
there
was
a
display
of

madame
bourdelais
with
her
three
children
madeleine
edmond
and
lucien
seated
according
to
their
size
was
getting
angry
with
the
smallest
because
he
continued
struggling
whilst
denise
tried
to
put
a
jacket
on
him
do
keep
still
do
you
think
it
rather
tight
mademoiselle
she
said
and
with
the
sharp
look
of
a
woman
difficult
to
deceive
she
examined
the
stuff
studied
the
cut
and
scrutinized
the
seams
no
it
fits
well
she
resumed
it
no
trifle
to
dress
all
these
little
ones
now
i
want
a
mantle
for
this
young
lady
denise
had
been
obliged
to
assist
in
serving
as
the
customers
had
besieged
her
department
in
great
force
she
was
looking
for
the
mantle
required
when
she
set
up
a
cry
of
surprise
what
it
you
what
the
matter
her
brother
jean
was
standing
before
her
a
parcel
in
his
hand
he
had
been
married
a
week
before
and
on
the
saturday
his
wife
a
dark
little
woman
with
a
provoking
charming
face
had
paid
a
long
visit
to
the
ladies
paradise
to
make
some
purchases
the
young
people
were
to
accompany
denise
to
valognes
it
was
to
be
a
regular
honeymoon
trip
a
month
holiday
which
would
remind
them
of
old
times
just
fancy
he
said
thérèse
has
forgotten
a
number
of
things
there
are
some
articles
to
be
changed
and
others
to
be
bought
so
as
she
was
in
a
hurry
she
sent
me
with
this
parcel
i
explain
but
she
interrupted
him
on
perceiving
pépé
what
pépé
too
and
his
school
well
said
jean
after
dinner
on
sunday
i
had
not
the
heart
to
take
him
back
he
will
return
this
evening
the
poor
child
is
very
downhearted
at
the
thought
of
being
shut
up
in
paris
whilst
we
shall
be
enjoying
ourselves
denise
smiled
at
them
in
spite
of
her
suffering
she
handed
madame
bourdelais
over
to
one
of
her
saleswomen
and
came
back
to
her
brothers
in
a
corner
of
the
department
which
was
fortunately
getting
clearer
the
youngsters
as
she
still
called
them
had
now
grown
to
be
big
fellows
pépé
at
twelve
years
old
was
already
taller
and
stouter
than
herself
but
still
taciturn
and
living
on
caresses
looking
too
very
gentle
in
his
whilst
jean
quite
a
head
taller
than
his
sister
with
blonde
hair
blowing
about
in
the
wind
still
retained
his
feminine
good
looks
and
she
always
slim
no
fatter
than
a
skylark
as
she
said
still
retained
her
anxious
motherly
authority
over
them
treating
them
as
children
in
need
of
all
her
attention
buttoning
up
jean
frock
coat
so
that
he
should
not
look
like
a
rake
and
seeing
that
pépé
had
got
a
clean
handkerchief
when
she
perceived
the
latter
swollen
eyes
she
gently
chided
him
you
must
be
reasonable
my
boy
your
studies
can
not
be
interrupted
said
she
i
take
you
away
at
the
holidays
is
there
anything
you
want
but
perhaps
you
prefer
to
have
the
money
then
she
turned
towards
the
other
and
you
youngster
it
your
fault
you
get
making
him
believe
that
we
are
going
to
have
wonderful
fun
just
try
to
be
a
little
more
reasonable
she
had
given
jean
four
thousand
francs
half
of
her
savings
to
enable
him
to
set
up
housekeeping
the
younger
one
cost
her
a
great
deal
for
schooling
indeed
all
her
money
went
for
them
as
in
former
days
they
alone
linked
her
to
life
and
work
for
she
had
again
vowed
that
she
would
never
marry
well
here
are
the
things
resumed
jean
in
the
first
place
a
light
brown
cloak
in
this
parcel
that
thérèse
but
he
stopped
and
denise
on
turning
round
to
see
what
had
frightened
him
perceived
mouret
standing
behind
them
for
a
moment
he
had
been
watching
her
acting
the
mother
towards
the
two
big
boys
scolding
and
embracing
them
and
turning
them
round
as
mothers
do
babies
when
changing
their
clothes
bourdoncle
had
remained
on
one
side
feigning
to
be
interested
in
the
sales
but
he
did
not
lose
sight
of
this
little
scene
they
are
your
brothers
are
they
not
asked
mouret
after
a
silence
he
had
the
icy
tone
and
rigid
demeanour
which
he
now
assumed
with
her
denise
herself
made
an
effort
to
remain
cold
her
smile
died
away
and
she
replied
yes
sir
i
married
off
the
eldest
and
his
wife
has
sent
him
for
some
purchases
mouret
continued
looking
at
the
three
of
them
at
last
he
said
the
youngest
has
grown
very
much
i
recognise
him
i
remember
having
seen
him
in
the
tuileries
gardens
one
evening
with
you
then
his
voice
which
was
coming
more
slowly
slightly
trembled
she
much
moved
bent
down
pretending
to
arrange
pépé
belt
both
brothers
who
had
turned
scarlet
stood
smiling
at
their
employer
they
very
much
like
you
said
the
latter
oh
she
exclaimed
they
much
handsomer
than
i
am
for
a
moment
he
seemed
to
be
comparing
their
faces
but
he
could
endure
it
no
longer
how
she
loved
them
he
walked
on
a
step
or
two
then
returned
and
whispered
in
her
ear
come
to
my
office
after
business
i
want
to
speak
to
you
before
you
go
away
this
time
mouret
went
off
and
continued
his
inspection
the
battle
was
once
more
raging
within
him
for
the
appointment
he
had
just
given
caused
him
a
sort
of
irritation
to
what
idea
had
he
yielded
on
seeing
her
with
her
brothers
it
was
maddening
to
think
that
he
could
no
longer
find
the
strength
to
assert
his
will
however
he
could
settle
it
by
saying
a
few
words
of
farewell
bourdoncle
who
had
rejoined
him
seemed
less
anxious
though
he
was
still
examining
him
with
stealthy
glances
meanwhile
denise
had
returned
to
madame
bourdelais
does
the
mantle
suit
you
madame
she
inquired
oh
yes
very
well
that
quite
enough
for
one
day
these
little
ones
are
ruining
me
denise
now
being
able
to
slip
off
went
to
listen
to
explanations
and
then
accompanied
him
to
the
various
counters
where
he
would
certainly
have
lost
his
head
without
her
first
came
the
brown
jacket
which
thérèse
now
wished
to
change
for
a
white
cloth
one
of
the
same
size
and
same
shape
and
the
young
woman
having
taken
the
parcel
went
to
the
mantle
department
followed
by
her
two
brothers
the
department
had
laid
out
all
its
light
coloured
garments
summer
jackets
and
capes
of
light
silk
and
fancy
woollens
but
there
was
little
doing
there
the
customers
were
but
few
and
far
between
nearly
all
the
saleswomen
were
clara
had
disappeared
a
month
before
and
some
said
that
she
had
altogether
gone
to
the
bad
as
for
marguerite
she
was
at
last
about
to
assume
the
management
of
the
little
shop
at
grenoble
where
her
cousin
was
waiting
for
her
madame
aurélie
alone
remained
there
immutable
in
the
curved
cuirass
of
her
silk
dress
and
with
her
imperial
face
retaining
the
yellowish
puffiness
of
an
antique
marble
however
her
son
albert
bad
conduct
was
a
source
of
great
trouble
to
her
and
she
would
have
retired
into
the
country
had
it
not
been
for
the
inroads
made
on
the
family
savings
by
this
scapegrace
whose
terrible
extravagance
threatened
to
swallow
up
the
rigolles
property
piece
by
piece
it
was
a
sort
of
punishment
on
them
for
breaking
up
their
home
for
the
mother
had
resumed
her
little
excursions
with
her
lady
friends
and
the
father
on
his
side
continued
his
musical
performances
bourdoncle
was
already
looking
at
madame
aurélie
with
a
discontented
air
surprised
that
she
lacked
the
tact
to
resign
too
old
for
business
such
was
his
opinion
the
knell
was
about
to
sound
which
would
sweep
away
the
lhomme
dynasty
ah
it
you
said
she
to
denise
with
exaggerated
amiability
you
want
this
cloak
changed
eh
certainly
at
once
ah
there
are
your
brothers
getting
quite
men
i
declare
in
spite
of
her
pride
she
would
have
gone
on
her
knees
to
pay
her
court
to
the
young
woman
in
her
department
as
in
the
others
nothing
but
denise
departure
was
being
talked
of
and
the
was
quite
ill
over
it
for
she
had
been
reckoning
on
the
protection
of
her
former
saleswoman
she
lowered
her
voice
to
say
it
reported
going
to
leave
us
really
it
is
possible
but
it
is
though
replied
denise
marguerite
was
listening
since
her
marriage
had
been
decided
on
she
had
marched
about
with
more
disdainful
airs
than
ever
on
her
face
and
she
came
up
saying
you
are
quite
right
above
everything
i
say
allow
me
to
bid
you
adieu
my
dear
some
customers
arriving
at
that
moment
madame
aurélie
requested
her
in
a
harsh
voice
to
attend
to
business
then
as
denise
was
taking
the
cloak
to
effect
the
return
herself
she
protested
and
called
an
auxiliary
this
again
was
an
innovation
suggested
to
mouret
by
the
young
woman
the
engagement
of
persons
to
carry
the
articles
about
thus
relieving
the
saleswomen
of
much
fatigue
go
with
mademoiselle
said
the
giving
the
auxiliary
the
cloak
then
returning
to
denise
she
added
pray
consider
the
matter
well
we
are
all
at
your
leaving
jean
and
pépé
who
were
waiting
smiling
amidst
this
overflowing
torrent
of
women
followed
their
sister
they
now
had
to
go
to
the
department
to
get
four
chemises
like
the
which
thérèse
had
bought
on
the
saturday
but
there
where
the
exhibition
of
white
goods
was
snowing
down
from
every
shelf
they
were
almost
stifled
and
found
it
very
difficult
to
get
along
in
the
first
place
at
the
corset
counter
a
little
scene
was
collecting
quite
a
crowd
madame
boutarel
who
had
arrived
in
paris
from
the
south
this
time
with
her
husband
and
daughter
had
been
wandering
all
over
the
place
since
morning
collecting
an
outfit
for
the
young
lady
who
was
about
to
be
married
the
father
was
consulted
at
every
turn
so
that
it
seemed
they
would
never
finish
at
last
they
had
stranded
here
and
whilst
the
young
lady
was
absorbed
in
a
profound
study
of
some
undergarments
the
mother
had
disappeared
having
cast
her
eyes
on
some
corsets
she
herself
fancied
when
monsieur
boutarel
a
big
man
quite
bewildered
left
his
daughter
to
search
for
his
wife
he
at
last
found
her
in
a
at
the
door
of
which
he
was
politely
invited
to
take
a
seat
these
rooms
were
like
narrow
cells
glazed
with
ground
glass
and
not
even
husbands
were
allowed
to
enter
them
saleswomen
came
out
and
went
in
quickly
closing
the
doors
behind
them
while
men
waited
outside
seated
in
rows
on
and
looking
very
weary
monsieur
boutarel
when
he
understood
matters
got
really
angry
crying
out
that
he
wanted
his
wife
and
insisting
on
knowing
what
they
had
done
with
her
it
was
in
vain
that
they
tried
to
calm
him
madame
boutarel
was
obliged
to
come
out
to
the
delight
of
the
crowd
which
was
discussing
and
laughing
over
the
affair
denise
and
her
brothers
were
at
last
able
to
get
past
every
article
of
ladies
underwear
was
here
displayed
in
a
suite
of
rooms
classified
into
various
departments
the
corsets
and
occupied
one
counter
there
were
corsets
duchess
cuirass
and
above
all
white
silk
corsets
with
divers
colours
these
latter
forming
a
special
display
an
army
of
dummies
without
heads
or
legs
nothing
indeed
but
busts
and
close
by
were
and
other
dress
improvers
often
of
fantastic
aspect
but
afterwards
came
articles
of
fine
linen
white
cuffs
and
cravats
white
fichus
and
collars
an
infinite
variety
of
light
trifles
a
white
foam
which
escaped
from
the
boxes
and
was
heaped
up
like
so
much
snow
there
were
loose
jackets
little
bodices
morning
gowns
and
peignoirs
in
linen
nainsook
and
lace
long
white
roomy
garments
which
spoke
of
the
morning
lounge
then
appeared
white
petticoats
of
every
length
the
petticoat
that
clings
to
the
knees
and
the
long
petticoat
which
sweeps
the
pavement
a
rising
sea
of
petticoats
in
which
one
lost
oneself
at
the
trousseau
department
there
was
a
wonderful
display
of
pleating
embroidery
valenciennes
percale
and
cambric
and
then
followed
another
room
devoted
to
where
the
voluptuous
whiteness
of
woman
clothing
developed
into
the
chaste
whiteness
of
infancy
an
innocence
a
joy
the
young
wife
become
a
mother
amidst
flannel
coifs
chemises
and
caps
like
dolls
things
christening
gowns
cashmere
pelisses
indeed
all
the
white
down
of
birth
like
a
fine
shower
of
white
feathers
they
are
chemises
with
said
jean
who
was
delighted
with
the
rising
tide
of
feminine
attire
about
him
however
pauline
ran
up
as
soon
as
she
perceived
denise
and
before
even
asking
what
she
wanted
began
to
talk
in
a
low
tone
stirred
as
she
was
by
the
rumours
circulating
in
the
building
in
her
department
two
saleswomen
had
even
got
to
quarrelling
over
it
one
affirming
and
the
other
denying
the
favourite
departure
you
stay
with
us
i
stake
my
life
what
would
become
of
me
said
pauline
and
as
denise
replied
that
she
intended
to
leave
the
next
day
no
no
the
other
added
you
think
so
but
i
know
better
you
must
appoint
me
now
that
i
got
my
baby
baugé
is
reckoning
on
it
my
dear
pauline
smiled
with
an
air
of
conviction
then
she
gave
the
six
chemises
and
jean
having
said
that
he
must
next
go
to
the
handkerchief
counter
she
called
an
auxiliary
to
carry
both
the
chemises
and
the
jacket
left
by
the
auxiliary
from
the
mantle
department
the
woman
who
happened
to
answer
was
mademoiselle
de
fontenailles
recently
married
to
joseph
she
had
just
obtained
this
menial
situation
as
a
great
favour
and
she
wore
a
long
black
blouse
marked
on
the
shoulder
with
a
number
in
yellow
wool
follow
mademoiselle
said
pauline
and
then
returning
to
denise
and
again
lowering
her
voice
she
added
it
understood
that
i
am
to
be
appointed
eh
denise
promised
with
a
laugh
by
way
of
joking
in
her
turn
and
she
went
off
going
down
the
stairs
with
jean
and
pépé
all
three
followed
by
the
auxiliary
on
the
they
found
themselves
in
the
woollen
department
a
gallery
entirely
hung
with
white
swanskin
cloth
and
white
flannel
liénard
whom
his
father
had
vainly
recalled
to
angers
was
talking
to
the
handsome
mignot
who
was
now
a
traveller
and
had
boldly
reappeared
at
the
ladies
paradise
no
doubt
they
were
speaking
of
denise
for
they
both
stopped
talking
to
bow
to
her
with
a
ceremonious
air
in
fact
as
she
passed
through
the
departments
the
salesmen
appeared
full
of
emotion
and
bent
their
heads
before
her
uncertain
as
they
were
what
she
might
be
the
next
day
they
whispered
and
thought
she
looked
triumphant
and
the
betting
was
once
more
altered
they
again
risked
bottles
of
argenteuil
wine
and
fish
dinners
over
the
event
she
had
entered
the
in
order
to
get
to
the
handkerchief
counter
which
was
at
the
further
end
the
show
of
white
goods
continued
cottons
madapolams
dimities
quiltings
calicoes
nainsooks
muslins
tarlatans
then
came
the
linen
in
enormous
piles
the
pieces
ranged
alternately
like
blocks
of
stone
stout
linen
fine
linen
of
all
widths
white
and
unbleached
some
of
pure
flax
whitened
in
the
sun
next
the
same
thing
commenced
once
more
there
were
departments
for
each
sort
of
linen
house
linen
table
linen
kitchen
linen
a
continual
crush
of
white
goods
sheets
innumerable
styles
of
napkins
aprons
and
dusters
and
the
bowing
continued
all
made
way
for
denise
to
pass
while
baugé
rushed
out
to
smile
on
her
as
on
the
good
fairy
of
the
house
at
last
after
crossing
the
counterpane
department
a
room
hung
with
white
banners
she
arrived
at
the
handkerchief
counter
the
ingenious
decoration
of
which
delighted
the
throng
everything
here
was
arranged
in
white
columns
white
pyramids
white

an
intricate
architecture
solely
composed
of
handkerchiefs
some
of

others
of

or
china
silk
some
marked
some
embroidered
by
hand
some
trimmed
with

some

and
some
woven
with

the
whole
forming
a
city
of
white
bricks
of
infinite
variety
standing
out
against
an
eastern
sky
warmed
to
a
white
heat
you
say
another
dozen
asked
denise
of
her
brother
cholet
handkerchiefs
eh
yes
like
this
one
he
replied
showing
a
handkerchief
in
his
parcel
jean
and
pépé
had
not
quitted
her
side
but
clung
to
her
as
they
had
done
formerly
on
arriving
in
paris
knocked
up
by
their
journey
this
vast
establishment
in
which
she
was
quite
at
home
ended
by
troubling
them
and
they
sheltered
themselves
in
her
shadow
placing
themselves
again
under
the
protection
of
this
second
mother
of
theirs
as
in
an
instinctive
of
their
infancy
the
employees
watching
them
as
they
passed
smiled
at
those
two
big
fellows
following
in
the
footsteps
of
that
grave
slim
girl
jean
frightened
in
spite
of
his
beard
pépé
bewildered
in
his
tunic
and
all
three
of
the
same
fair
complexion
a
fairness
which
made
a
whisper
run
from
one
end
of
the
counters
to
the
other
they
are
her
brothers
they
are
her
brothers
but
whilst
denise
was
looking
for
a
salesman
there
occurred
another
meeting
mouret
and
bourdoncle
had
entered
the
gallery
and
as
the
former
again
stopped
in
front
of
the
young
woman
without
however
speaking
to
her
madame
desforges
and
madame
guibal
passed
by
henriette
suppressed
the
quiver
which
had
invaded
her
whole
being
she
looked
at
mouret
and
then
at
denise
they
also
had
looked
at
her
and
it
was
a
sort
of
mute
the
common
end
of
many
great
dramas
of
the
heart
a
glance
exchanged
in
the
crush
of
a
crowd
mouret
had
already
moved
off
whilst
denise
strayed
into
the
depths
of
the
department
accompanied
by
her
brothers
and
still
in
search
of
a
disengaged
salesman
but
in
the
auxiliary
following
denise
with
a
yellow
number
on
her
shoulder
and
a
coarse
cadaverous
face
henriette
had
recognised
mademoiselle
de
fontenailles
and
relieved
herself
by
saying
to
madame
guibal
in
an
angry
voice
just
see
what
he
doing
with
that
unfortunate
girl
is
it
shameful
a
marchioness
and
he
makes
her
follow
like
a
dog
the
creatures
he
has
picked
up
in
the
street
then
she
tried
to
calm
herself
adding
with
an
affected
air
of
indifference
let
go
and
see
their
display
of
silks
the
silk
department
was
like
a
great
chamber
of
love
hung
with
white
by
the
caprice
of
some
snowy
maiden
wishing
to
show
off
her
own
spotless
whiteness
pieces
of
velvet
hung
from
the
columns
forming
a
creamy
white
background
against
which
silk
and
satin
draperies
showed
with
a
metallic
and
whiteness
and
there
were
also
festoons
of
poult
and
gros
grain
silks
light
foulards
and
surahs
which
varied
from
the
dull
white
of
a
norwegian
blonde
to
the
transparent
white
warmed
by
the
sun
of
a
fair
italian
or
spanish
beauty
favier
was
just
then
engaged
in
measuring
some
white
silk
for
the
pretty
lady
that
elegant
blonde
who
was
such
a
frequent
customer
at
the
counter
and
whom
the
salesmen
never
referred
to
except
by
that
name
she
had
dealt
at
the
shop
for
years
and
yet
they
knew
nothing
about
her
neither
her
condition
of
life
her
address
nor
even
her
name
none
of
them
in
fact
tried
to
find
out
although
every
time
she
made
her
appearance
they
all
indulged
in
suppositions
just
for
something
to
talk
about
she
was
getting
thinner
she
was
getting
stouter
she
had
slept
well
or
she
must
have
been
out
late
the
previous
evening
indeed
every
little
incident
of
her
unknown
life
outdoor
events
and
domestic
dramas
alike
found
an
echo
at
the
paradise
and
was
commented
on
that
day
she
seemed
very
gay
and
so
on
returning
from
the
whither
he
had
conducted
her
favier
remarked
to
hutin
perhaps
she
going
to
marry
again
what
is
she
a
widow
asked
the
other
i
do
know
but
you
must
remember
the
time
she
was
in
mourning
perhaps
she
made
some
money
by
speculating
on
the
bourse
a
silence
ensued
at
last
he
ended
by
saying
however
that
her
business
it
would
do
to
take
notice
of
all
the
women
we
see
here
but
hutin
was
looking
very
thoughtful
for
two
days
before
he
had
had
a
warm
discussion
with
the
managers
and
felt
himself
condemned
after
the
great
sale
his
dismissal
was
certain
for
a
long
time
he
had
felt
his
position
giving
way
at
the
last
they
had
complained
that
he
had
not
even
transacted
the
amount
of
business
fixed
in
advance
and
moreover
he
was
threatened
by
the
appetites
of
the
others
now
slowly
devouring
him
in
his
turn
by
all
the
silent
warfare
which
was
waged
in
the
department
amidst
the
very
motion
of
the
machine
favier
secret
undermining
could
be
heard
like
a
muffled
sound
of
at
work
underground
he
had
already
received
the
promise
of
the
place
but
hutin
who
was
aware
of
it
instead
of
attacking
his
old
comrade
looked
upon
him
as
a
clever
fellow
to
think
of
it
a
chap
who
had
always
appeared
so
cold
so
humble
whom
he
had
made
such
use
of
to
turn
out
both
robineau
and
bouthemont
he
was
full
of
mingled
surprise
and
respect
by
the
way
all
at
once
resumed
favier
she
going
to
stay
you
know
the
governor
has
just
been
seen
casting
sheep
eyes
at
her
i
shall
be
let
in
for
a
bottle
of
champagne
over
it
he
referred
to
denise
the
gossip
was
going
on
more
than
ever
passing
from
one
counter
to
the
other
through
the
constantly
increasing
crowd
of
customers
the
silk
salesmen
were
especially
excited
for
they
had
been
indulging
in
heavy
bets
on
the
affair
by
jove
exclaimed
hutin
waking
up
as
if
from
a
dream
was
i
a
flat
not
to
pay
court
to
her
i
should
be
all
right
now
then
on
seeing
favier
laugh
he
blushed
at
this
confession
and
pretended
to
laugh
himself
adding
as
though
to
recall
his
words
that
it
was
she
who
had
ruined
him
with
the
management
then
a
desire
for
violence
seizing
hold
of
him
he
finished
by
getting
into
a
rage
with
the
salesmen
whom
the
assault
of
the
customers
had
disbanded
but
all
at
once
he
again
smiled
having
just
perceived
madame
desforges
and
madame
guibal
slowly
crossing
the
department
what
can
we
serve
you
with
madame
nothing
thanks
replied
henriette
you
see
i
merely
walking
round
i
only
come
out
of
curiosity
however
he
succeeded
in
stopping
her
and
lowered
his
voice
quite
a
plan
was
springing
up
in
his
head
he
began
to
flatter
her
and
run
down
the
house
he
had
had
enough
of
it
and
preferred
to
go
away
rather
than
remain
a
witness
of
such
disorder
she
listened
delighted
it
was
she
herself
who
thinking
to
deprive
the
ladies
paradise
of
his
services
offered
to
get
him
engaged
by
bouthemont
as
in
the
silk
department
when
the
four
seasons
should
start
again
the
matter
was
settled
in
whispers
whilst
madame
guibal
interested
herself
in
the
displays
may
i
offer
you
one
of
these
bouquets
of
violets
resumed
hutin
aloud
pointing
to
a
table
where
there
were
four
or
five
bunches
of
the
flowers
which
he
had
procured
from
a
for
personal
presents
ah
no
indeed
exclaimed
henriette
recoiling
i
do
wish
to
take
any
part
in
the
wedding
they
understood
each
other
and
separated
with
a
laugh
exchanging
glances
of
intelligence
then
as
madame
desforges
began
looking
for
madame
guibal
she
set
up
an
exclamation
of
surprise
on
seeing
her
with
madame
marty
the
latter
followed
by
her
daughter
valentine
had
for
the
last
two
hours
been
carried
through
the
place
by
one
of
those
spending
fits
whence
she
always
emerged
weary
and
bewildered
she
had
roamed
about
the
furniture
department
which
a
show
of
white
lacquered
good
had
changed
into
a
vast
virginal
chamber
the
ribbon
and
neckerchief
departments
which
formed
white
colonnades
the
mercery
and
trimming
departments
with
white
fringes
surrounding
ingenious
trophies
patiently
built
up
of
cards
of
buttons
and
packets
of
needles
and
the
hosiery
department
in
which
there
was
a
great
crush
that
year
to
see
an
immense
piece
of
decoration
the
resplendent
name
of
the
paradise
in
letters
three
yards
high
formed
of
white
socks
on
a
groundwork
of
red
ones
but
madame
marty
was
especially
excited
by
the
new
departments
they
could
indeed
never
open
a
new
department
but
she
must
inaugurate
it
she
was
bound
to
plunge
in
and
buy
something
and
so
at
the
millinery
counter
installed
in
a
new
room
on
the
she
had
spent
an
hour
in
having
the
cupboards
emptied
taking
the
bonnets
off
the
stands
ranged
on
a
couple
of
tables
and
trying
all
of
them
white
hats
white
bonnets
and
white
togues
on
herself
and
her
daughter
then
she
had
gone
down
to
the
boot
department
at
the
further
end
of
a
gallery
on
the
behind
the
cravats
a
counter
which
had
been
opened
that
day
and
which
she
had
turned
topsy
turvy
seized
with
sickly
desire
in
presence
of
the
white
silk
slippers
trimmed
with
swansdown
and
the
white
satin
boots
and
shoes
with
high
louis
xv
heels
oh
my
dear
she
stammered
you
no
idea
they
have
a
wonderful
assortment
of
bonnets
i
chosen
one
for
myself
and
one
for
my
daughter
and
the
boots
eh
valentine
they
marvellous
added
the
latter
with
the
boldness
of
one
who
is
at
last
married
there
are
some
boots
at
twenty
francs
and
a
half
the
pair
which
are
delicious
a
salesman
was
following
them
dragging
along
the
eternal
chair
on
which
a
mountain
of
articles
was
already
heaped
how
is
monsieur
marty
asked
madame
desforges
very
well
i
believe
replied
madame
marty
scared
by
this
abrupt
question
which
fell
amidst
her
rage
for
spending
still
shut
up
you
know
my
uncle
was
to
go
to
see
him
this
morning
then
she
paused
and
exclaimed
oh
look
is
it
lovely
the
ladies
who
had
gone
on
a
few
steps
found
themselves
before
the
new
flowers
and
feathers
department
installed
in
the
central
gallery
between
the
silks
and
the
gloves
under
the
bright
light
from
the
glass
roof
there
appeared
an
enormous
florescence
a
white
sheaf
tall
and
broad
as
an
oak
the
base
was
formed
of
single
flowers
violets
lilies
of
the
valley
hyacinths
daisies
all
the
delicate
white
blossoms
of
the
garden
then
came
bouquets
white
roses
softened
by
a
fleshy
tint
great
white
peonies
slightly
shaded
with
carmine
white
chrysanthemums
with
narrow
petals
and
starred
with
yellow
and
the
flowers
still
ascended
great
mystical
lilies
branches
of
apple
blossom
bunches
of
white
lilac
a
continual
blossoming
surmounted
at
the
height
of
the
first
storey
by
tufts
of
ostrich
feathers
white
plumes
which
seemed
like
the
airy
breath
of
this
collection
of
white
flowers
one
corner
was
devoted
to
the
display
of
trimmings
and
wreaths
there
were
also
metallic
flowers
silver
thistles
and
silver
ears
of
corn
and
amidst
the
foliage
and
the
petals
amidst
all
the
muslin
silk
and
velvet
in
which
drops
of
gum
set
drops
of
dew
fluttered
birds
of
paradise
for
the
trimming
of
hats
purple
tanagers
with
black
tails
and
kingbirds
with
changing
plumage
i
going
to
buy
a
branch
of
resumed
madame
marty
it
delicious
is
it
and
that
little
bird
do
look
valentine
i
must
take
it
however
madame
guibal
began
to
feel
tired
of
standing
still
in
the
eddying
crowd
and
at
last
exclaimed
well
we
leave
you
to
make
your
purchases
we
going
upstairs
no
no
wait
for
me
cried
the
other
i
going
up
too
there
the
perfumery
department
upstairs
i
must
see
that
this
department
created
the
day
before
was
next
door
to
the
madame
desforges
to
avoid
the
crush
on
the
stairs
spoke
of
going
up
in
the
lift
but
they
had
to
abandon
the
idea
there
were
so
many
people
waiting
their
turn
at
last
they
arrived
passing
before
the
public
refreshment
bar
where
the
crowd
was
becoming
so
great
that
an
inspector
had
to
restrain
the
outburst
of
appetite
by
only
allowing
the
gluttonous
customers
to
enter
in
small
groups
and
from
this
point
the
ladies
already
began
to
smell
the
perfumery
department
for
its
penetrating
odour
scented
the
whole
gallery
there
was
quite
a
struggle
over
one
article
the
paradise
soap
a
specialty
of
the
house
in
the
show
cases
and
on
the
crystal
tablets
of
the
shelves
were
ranged
pots
of
pomade
and
paste
boxes
of
powder
and
paint
phials
of
oil
and
toilet
vinegar
whilst
the
fine
brushes
combs
scissors
and
occupied
a
special
place
the
salesmen
had
managed
to
decorate
the
shelves
exclusively
with
white
porcelain
pots
and
white
glass
bottles
but
what
delighted
the
customers
above
all
was
a
silver
fountain
in
the
centre
a
shepherdess
standing
on
a
harvest
of
flowers
whence
flowed
a
continuous
stream
of
violet
water
which
fell
with
a
musical
plash
into
the
metal
basin
an
exquisite
odour
was
diffused
around
and
the
ladies
dipped
their
handkerchiefs
in
the
scent
as
they
passed
there
said
madame
marty
when
she
had
loaded
herself
with
lotions
dentrifices
and
cosmetics
now
i
done
i
at
your
service
go
and
rejoin
madame
de
boves
however
on
the
landing
of
the
great
central
staircase
they
were
again
stopped
by
the
japanese
department
this
counter
had
grown
wonderfully
since
the
day
when
mouret
had
amused
himself
by
setting
up
in
the
same
place
a
little
proposition
table
covered
with
a
few
soiled
articles
without
at
all
foreseeing
its
future
success
few
departments
had
had
more
modest
beginnings
and
yet
now
it
overflowed
with
old
bronzes
old
ivories
and
old
lacquer
work
it
did
fifteen
hundred
thousand
francs
worth
of
business
a
year
ransacking
the
far
east
where
travellers
pillaged
the
palaces
and
the
temples
for
it
besides
fresh
departments
were
always
springing
up
they
had
tried
two
new
ones
in
december
in
order
to
fill
up
the
empty
spaces
caused
by
the
dead
winter
season
a
book
department
and
a
toy
department
which
would
certainly
expand
and
sweep
away
certain
shops
in
the
neighbourhood
four
years
had
sufficed
for
the
japanese
department
to
attract
the
entire
artistic
custom
of
paris
this
time
madame
desforges
herself
notwithstanding
the
rancour
which
had
made
her
vow
not
to
buy
anything
succumbed
before
some
finely
carved
ivory
send
it
to
my
house
said
she
rapidly
at
a
neighbouring
ninety
francs
is
it
not
and
seeing
madame
marty
and
her
daughter
busy
with
a
lot
of
trashy
porcelains
she
resumed
as
she
carried
off
madame
guibal
you
will
find
us
in
the
i
really
must
sit
down
a
little
while
in
the
however
they
were
obliged
to
remain
standing
all
the
chairs
round
the
large
table
covered
with
newspapers
were
occupied
great
fat
fellows
were
reading
and
lolling
about
without
even
thinking
of
giving
up
their
seats
to
the
ladies
a
few
women
were
writing
their
faces
almost
on
the
paper
as
if
to
conceal
their
letters
under
the
flowers
of
their
hats
madame
de
boves
was
not
there
and
henriette
was
getting
impatient
when
she
perceived
vallagnosc
who
was
also
looking
for
his
wife
and
he
bowed
and
said
they
must
be
in
the
lace
department
impossible
to
drag
them
away
i
just
see
and
he
was
gallant
enough
to
procure
the
others
two
chairs
before
going
off
in
the
lace
department
the
crush
was
increasing
every
minute
the
great
show
of
white
was
there
triumphing
in
its
most
delicate
and
costly
whiteness
here
was
the
supreme
temptation
the
goading
of
a
mad
desire
which
bewildered
all
the
women
the
department
had
been
turned
into
a
white
temple
tulles
and
guipures
falling
from
above
formed
a
white
sky
one
of
those
cloudy
veils
whose
fine
network
pales
the
morning
sun
round
the
columns
descended
flounces
of
malines
and
valenciennes
white
dancers
skirts
unfolding
in
a
snowy
shiver
to
the
floor
then
on
all
sides
on
every
counter
there
were
snowy
masses
of
white
spanish
blonde
as
light
as
air
brussels
with
large
flowers
on
a
delicate
mesh
point
and
venice
point
with
heavier
designs
alençon
point
and
bruges
of
royal
and
almost
sacred
richness
it
seemed
as
if
the
god
of
finery
had
here
set
up
his
white
tabernacle
madame
de
boves
after
wandering
about
before
the
counters
for
a
long
time
with
her
daughter
and
feeling
a
sensual
longing
to
plunge
her
hands
into
the
goods
had
just
made
up
her
mind
to
request
deloche
to
show
her
some
alençon
point
at
first
he
brought
out
some
imitation
stuff
but
she
wished
to
see
real
alençon
and
was
not
satisfied
with
narrow
pieces
at
three
hundred
francs
the
yard
but
insisted
on
examining
deep
flounces
at
a
thousand
francs
a
yard
and
handkerchiefs
and
fans
at
seven
and
eight
hundred
francs
the
counter
was
soon
covered
with
a
fortune
in
a
corner
of
the
department
inspector
jouve
who
had
not
lost
sight
of
madame
de
boves
notwithstanding
the
apparent
dawdling
stood
amidst
the
crowd
with
an
indifferent
air
but
still
keeping
a
sharp
eye
on
her
have
you
any
capes
in
point
she
at
last
inquired
show
me
some
please
the
salesman
whom
she
had
kept
there
for
twenty
minutes
dared
not
resist
for
she
appeared
so
aristocratic
with
her
imposing
air
and
princess
voice
however
he
hesitated
for
the
employees
were
cautioned
against
heaping
up
these
precious
fabrics
and
he
had
allowed
himself
to
be
robbed
of
ten
yards
of
malines
only
the
week
before
but
she
perturbed
him
so
he
yielded
and
abandoned
the
alençon
point
for
a
moment
in
order
to
take
the
lace
she
had
asked
for
from
a
drawer
oh
look
mamma
said
blanche
who
was
ransacking
a
box
close
by
full
of
cheap
valenciennes
we
might
take
some
of
this
for
madame
de
boves
did
not
reply
and
her
daughter
on
turning
her
flabby
face
saw
her
with
her
hands
plunged
amidst
the
lace
slipping
some
alençon
flounces
up
the
sleeve
of
her
mantle
blanche
did
not
appear
surprised
however
but
moved
forward
instinctively
to
conceal
her
mother
when
jouve
suddenly
stood
before
them
he
leant
over
and
politely
murmured
in
the
countess
ear
have
the
kindness
to
follow
me
madame
for
a
moment
she
revolted
but
what
for
sir
have
the
kindness
to
follow
me
madame
repeated
the
inspector
without
raising
his
voice
with
her
face
full
of
anguish
she
threw
a
rapid
glance
around
her
then
all
at
once
she
resigned
herself
resumed
her
haughty
bearing
and
walked
away
by
his
side
like
a
queen
who
deigns
to
accept
the
services
of
an
not
one
of
the
many
customers
had
observed
the
scene
and
deloche
on
turning
to
the
counter
looked
at
her
as
she
was
walked
off
his
mouth
wide
open
with
astonishment
what
that
one
as
well
that
lady
really
it
was
time
to
have
them
all
searched
and
blanche
who
was
left
free
followed
her
mother
at
a
distance
lingering
amidst
the
sea
of
faces
livid
and
hesitating
between
the
duty
of
not
deserting
her
mother
and
the
terror
of
being
detained
with
her
at
last
she
saw
her
enter
bourdoncle
office
and
then
contented
herself
with
walking
about
near
the
door
bourdoncle
whom
mouret
had
just
got
rid
of
happened
to
be
there
as
a
rule
he
dealt
with
robberies
of
this
sort
when
committed
by
persons
of
distinction
jouve
had
long
been
watching
this
lady
and
had
informed
him
of
it
so
that
he
was
not
astonished
when
the
inspector
briefly
explained
the
matter
to
him
in
fact
such
extraordinary
cases
passed
through
his
hands
that
he
declared
woman
to
be
capable
of
anything
once
the
passion
for
finery
had
seized
upon
her
as
he
was
aware
of
mouret
acquaintance
with
the
thief
he
treated
her
with
the
utmost
politeness
we
excuse
these
moments
of
weakness
madame
said
he
but
pray
consider
the
consequences
of
such
a
thing
suppose
some
one
else
had
seen
you
slip
this
lace
but
she
interrupted
him
in
great
indignation
she
a
thief
what
did
he
take
her
for
she
was
the
countess
de
boves
her
husband
of
the
state
studs
was
received
at
court
i
know
it
i
know
it
madame
repeated
bourdoncle
quietly
i
have
the
honour
of
knowing
you
in
the
first
place
will
you
kindly
give
up
the
lace
you
have
on
you
but
not
allowing
him
to
say
another
word
she
again
protested
handsome
in
her
violence
even
shedding
tears
like
some
great
lady
vilely
and
wrongfully
accused
any
one
else
but
he
would
have
been
shaken
and
have
feared
some
deplorable
mistake
for
she
threatened
to
go
to
law
to
avenge
such
an
insult
take
care
sir
my
husband
will
certainly
appeal
to
the
minister
come
you
are
not
more
reasonable
than
the
others
declared
bourdoncle
losing
patience
we
must
search
you
still
she
did
not
yield
but
with
superb
assurance
declared
very
good
search
me
but
i
warn
you
you
are
risking
your
house
jouve
went
to
fetch
two
saleswomen
from
the
corset
department
when
he
returned
he
informed
bourdoncle
that
the
lady
daughter
left
at
liberty
had
not
quitted
the
doorway
and
asked
if
she
also
should
be
detained
although
he
had
not
seen
her
take
anything
the
manager
however
who
always
did
things
in
a
fitting
way
decided
that
she
should
not
be
brought
in
in
order
not
to
cause
her
mother
to
blush
before
her
the
two
men
retired
into
a
neighbouring
room
whilst
the
saleswomen
searched
the
countess
besides
the
twelve
yards
of
alençon
point
at
a
thousand
francs
the
yard
concealed
in
her
sleeve
they
found
upon
her
a
handkerchief
a
fan
and
a
cravat
making
a
total
of
about
fourteen
thousand
francs
worth
of
lace
she
had
been
stealing
like
this
for
the
last
year
ravaged
by
a
furious
irresistible
passion
for
dress
these
fits
got
worse
growing
daily
sweeping
away
all
the
reasonings
of
prudence
and
the
enjoyment
she
felt
in
the
indulgence
of
them
was
the
more
violent
from
the
fact
that
she
was
risking
before
the
eyes
of
a
crowd
her
name
her
pride
and
her
husband
high
position
now
that
the
latter
allowed
her
to
empty
his
drawers
she
stole
although
she
had
her
pockets
full
of
money
she
stole
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
stealing
goaded
on
by
desire
urged
on
by
the
species
of
kleptomania
which
her
unsatisfied
luxurious
tastes
had
formerly
developed
in
her
at
sight
of
the
vast
brutal
temptations
of
the
big
shops
the
manager
of
one
of
the
great
london
drapery
houses
was
telling
me
recently
that
the
same
kind
of
thing
is
far
less
infrequent
than
might
be
imagined
among
certain
english
women
of
fashion
and
he
added
that
these
affairs
are
as
a
rule
hushed
up
even
as
they
are
hushed
up
in
paris
it
a
trap
cried
she
when
bourdoncle
and
jouve
came
in
this
lace
was
placed
on
me
i
swear
it
before
heaven
she
was
now
shedding
tears
of
rage
and
fell
on
a
chair
suffocating
bourdoncle
sent
the
saleswomen
away
and
resumed
with
his
quiet
air
we
are
quite
willing
madame
to
hush
up
this
painful
affair
for
the
sake
of
your
family
but
you
must
first
sign
a
paper
thus
worded
have
stolen
some
lace
from
the
ladies
paradise
followed
by
particulars
of
the
lace
and
the
date
however
i
shall
be
happy
to
return
you
this
document
whenever
you
like
to
bring
me
a
sum
of
two
thousand
francs
for
the
poor
she
again
rose
and
declared
in
a
fresh
outburst
i
never
sign
that
i
rather
die
you
wo
die
madame
but
i
warn
you
that
i
shall
shortly
send
for
the
police
then
followed
a
frightful
scene
she
insulted
him
she
stammered
that
it
was
cowardly
for
a
man
to
torture
a
woman
in
that
way
her
beauty
her
tall
majestic
person
was
distorted
by
vulgar
rage
then
she
tried
to
soften
him
and
jouve
entreating
them
in
the
name
of
their
mothers
and
speaking
of
dragging
herself
at
their
feet
and
as
they
however
remained
quite
unmoved
hardened
by
custom
she
all
at
once
sat
down
and
began
to
write
with
a
trembling
hand
the
pen
sputtered
the
words
i
have
stolen
madly
wildly
written
went
almost
through
the
thin
paper
whilst
she
repeated
in
a
choking
voice
there
sir
there
i
yield
to
force
bourdoncle
took
the
paper
carefully
folded
it
and
put
it
in
a
drawer
saying
you
see
it
in
company
for
ladies
after
talking
of
dying
rather
than
signing
generally
forget
to
come
and
redeem
these
of
theirs
however
i
hold
it
at
your
disposal
you
be
able
to
judge
whether
it
worth
two
thousand
francs
but
now
that
she
had
paid
the
forfeit
she
became
as
arrogant
as
ever
i
can
go
now
she
asked
in
a
sharp
tone
bourdoncle
was
already
occupied
with
other
business
on
jouve
report
he
decided
on
the
dismissal
of
deloche
a
stupid
fellow
who
was
always
being
robbed
and
who
never
had
any
authority
over
customers
madame
de
boves
repeated
her
question
and
as
they
dismissed
her
with
an
affirmative
nod
she
enveloped
both
of
them
in
a
murderous
glance
of
the
flood
of
insulting
words
that
she
kept
back
one
melodramatic
cry
escaped
her
lips
wretches
said
she
banging
the
door
after
her
meanwhile
blanche
had
not
strayed
far
from
the
office
her
ignorance
of
what
was
going
on
inside
and
the
coming
and
going
of
jouve
and
the
two
saleswomen
frightened
her
she
had
visions
of
the
police
the
assize
court
and
the
prison
but
all
at
once
she
stopped
short
for
vallagnosc
was
before
her
that
husband
whom
she
had
married
but
a
month
previously
and
with
whom
she
still
felt
rather
awkward
and
he
questioned
her
astonished
at
her
bewildered
appearance
where
your
mother
have
you
lost
each
other
come
tell
me
you
make
me
feel
anxious
nothing
in
the
way
of
a
colourable
fiction
presented
itself
to
her
mind
and
in
great
distress
she
told
him
everything
in
a
low
voice
mamma
mamma
she
has
been
stealing
what
stealing
at
last
he
understood
his
wife
bloated
livid
countenance
ravaged
by
fear
terrified
him
some
lace
like
that
up
her
sleeve
she
continued
stammering
you
saw
her
then
you
were
looking
on
he
murmured
chilled
to
feel
that
she
had
been
a
sort
of
accomplice
they
had
to
stop
talking
as
several
persons
were
already
turning
round
hesitation
full
of
anguish
kept
vallagnosc
motionless
for
a
moment
what
was
to
be
done
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
go
into
office
when
he
perceived
mouret
crossing
the
gallery
thereupon
after
telling
his
wife
to
wait
for
him
he
caught
hold
of
his
old
friend
arm
and
informed
him
of
the
affair
in
broken
sentences
the
latter
hastily
took
him
into
his
office
where
he
soon
put
him
at
rest
as
to
the
possible
consequences
he
assured
him
that
he
need
not
interfere
and
without
appearing
at
all
excited
about
this
robbery
as
if
he
had
foreseen
it
long
ago
he
explained
in
what
way
it
would
all
be
arranged
vallagnosc
however
even
when
he
no
longer
feared
an
immediate
arrest
did
not
accept
the
affair
with
this
admirable
coolness
he
had
thrown
himself
into
an
and
now
that
he
could
discuss
the
matter
began
to
lament
his
own
unfortunate
position
was
it
possible
that
he
had
married
into
a
family
of
thieves
a
stupid
marriage
that
he
had
drifted
into
just
to
please
his
wife
father
surprised
by
his
childish
violence
mouret
watched
him
weeping
thinking
the
while
of
his
former
pessimist
boasting
had
he
not
scores
of
times
proclaimed
the
nothingness
of
life
in
which
alone
had
any
attraction
and
by
way
of
diversion
mouret
amused
himself
for
a
minute
by
preaching
indifference
to
his
friend
in
a
friendly
bantering
tone
but
at
this
vallagnosc
got
angry
he
was
quite
unable
to
recover
his
philosophy
and
with
his
breeding
burst
into
virtuously
indignant
cries
against
his
as
soon
as
trouble
fell
on
himself
as
soon
as
he
was
just
touched
by
human
suffering
at
which
he
had
always
coldly
laughed
the
boastful
sceptic
collapsed
and
bled
it
was
abominable
they
were
dragging
the
honour
of
his
race
into
the
gutter
the
world
seemed
to
be
coming
to
an
end
come
calm
yourself
concluded
mouret
stricken
with
pity
i
tell
you
that
everything
happens
and
nothing
happens
because
that
does
not
seem
to
comfort
you
just
now
but
i
think
that
you
ought
to
go
and
offer
your
arm
to
madame
de
boves
that
would
be
more
sensible
than
causing
a
scandal
the
deuce
to
think
of
it
you
who
professed
such
scorn
for
the
universal
rascality
of
the
present
day
of
course
cried
vallagnosc
innocently
when
it
is
a
question
of
other
people
however
he
got
up
and
followed
his
old
advice
both
were
returning
to
the
gallery
when
madame
de
boves
came
out
of
bourdoncle
office
she
accepted
her
arm
with
a
majestic
air
and
as
mouret
bowed
to
her
with
respectful
gallantry
he
heard
her
saying
they
apologized
to
me
really
these
mistakes
are
abominable
blanche
joined
them
and
they
soon
disappeared
in
the
crowd
then
mouret
alone
and
pensive
crossed
the
shop
once
more
this
scene
which
had
diverted
his
thoughts
from
the
struggle
going
on
within
him
now
increased
his
fever
and
decided
him
to
make
a
supreme
effort
a
vague
connection
arose
in
his
mind
the
robbery
perpetrated
by
that
unfortunate
woman
that
last
folly
of
the
conquered
customer
laid
low
at
the
feet
of
the
tempter
evoked
the
proud
and
avenging
image
of
denise
whose
victorious
heel
he
could
feel
upon
his
throat
he
stopped
at
the
top
of
the
central
staircase
and
gazed
for
a
long
time
into
the
immense
nave
where
his
nation
of
women
was
swarming
six
was
about
to
strike
the
daylight
decreasing
was
gradually
forsaking
the
covered
galleries
already
dim
and
even
waning
in
the
halls
which
gloom
was
slowly
invading
and
in
this
uncertain
glimmer
the
electric
lamps
lighted
up
one
by
one
their
globes
of
an
opaque
whiteness
studding
with
moons
the
distant
depths
of
the
departments
it
was
a
white
brightness
of
a
blinding
fixity
spreading
like
the
radiance
of
a
discoloured
star
and
killing
the
twilight
then
when
all
were
lighted
there
came
a
delighted
murmur
from
the
crowd
and
the
great
show
of
white
goods
assumed
a
fairy
splendour
it
seemed
as
if
this
colossal
orgie
of
white
was
also
burning
itself
becoming
so
much
light
the
song
of
the
white
seemed
to
soar
upward
in
the
flaming
whiteness
of
an
aurora
a
white
glimmer
darted
from
the
linen
and
calico
department
in
the
monsigny
gallery
like
the
first
bright
streak
which
lights
up
the
eastern
sky
whilst
along
the
michodière
gallery
the
mercery
and
the
passementerie
the
and
the
ribbons
threw
out
reflections
of
distant
hills
with
the
white
flash
of
buttons
silvered
bronzes
and
sparkling
beads
but
the
central
nave
especially
was
filled
with
a
blaze
of
white
the
white
muslin
puffings
round
the
columns
the
white
dimities
and
piqués
draping
the
staircases
the
white
counterpanes
drooping
like
banners
the
white
guipures
and
laces
flying
in
the
air
opened
up
a
firmament
of
dreamland
a
vista
of
the
dazzling
whiteness
of
some
paradise
where
the
marriage
of
an
unknown
queen
was
being
celebrated
the
tent
of
the
was
this
giant
alcove
with
white
curtains
white
gauzes
and
white
tulles
whose
shimmer
screened
the
bride
in
her
white
nudity
from
the
gaze
of
the
curious
there
was
now
nothing
but
this
blinding
nucleus
of
white
light
in
which
all
other
whites
were
merged
this
snowy
starry
dust
twinkling
in
the
clear
radiance
and
mouret
still
continued
to
watch
his
nation
of
women
amidst
the
shimmering
blaze
their
black
shadows
stood
out
vigorously
against
the
pale
backgrounds
long
eddies
would
now
and
again
part
the
crowd
the
fever
of
the
day
great
sale
swept
past
like
a
frenzy
through
the
disorderly
billowy
sea
of
heads
people
were
beginning
to
leave
pillaged
stuffs
encumbered
all
the
counters
and
gold
was
chinking
in
the
tills
whilst
the
customers
went
off
their
purses
emptied
and
their
heads
turned
by
the
wealth
of
luxury
amidst
which
they
had
been
wandering
all
day
it
was
he
who
possessed
them
thus
who
held
them
at
his
mercy
by
his
continuous
displays
of
novelties
his
reductions
of
prices
and
his
returns
his
gallantry
puffery
and
advertisements
he
had
conquered
even
the
mothers
he
reigned
over
all
with
the
brutality
of
a
despot
whose
caprices
ruined
many
a
household
his
creation
was
a
sort
of
new
religion
the
churches
gradually
deserted
by
wavering
faith
were
replaced
by
his
bazaar
in
the
minds
of
the
idle
women
of
paris
woman
now
came
and
spent
her
leisure
time
in
his
establishment
those
shivering
anxious
hours
which
she
had
formerly
passed
in
churches
a
necessary
consumption
of
nervous
passion
an
ever
renewed
struggle
of
the
god
of
dress
against
the
husband
an
ever
renewed
worship
of
the
body
with
the
promise
of
future
divine
beauty
if
he
had
closed
his
doors
there
would
have
been
a
rising
in
the
street
the
despairing
cry
of
worshippers
deprived
of
their
confessional
and
altar
in
their
still
growing
passion
for
luxury
he
saw
them
notwithstanding
the
lateness
of
the
hour
yet
obstinately
lingering
in
the
huge
iron
building
on
the
suspended
staircases
and
flying
bridges
madame
marty
and
her
daughter
carried
away
to
the
highest
point
were
wandering
amongst
the
furniture
madame
bourdelais
retained
by
her
young
people
could
not
get
away
from
the
fancy
goods
and
then
came
another
group
madame
de
boves
still
on
arm
and
followed
by
blanche
stopping
in
each
department
and
still
daring
to
examine
the
goods
with
her
superb
air
but
amidst
the
crowded
sea
of
customers
that
sea
of
bodies
inflated
with
life
and
beating
with
desire
one
and
all
decorated
with
bunches
of
violets
as
though
for
the
bridal
of
some
sovereign
mouret
could
now
only
distinguish
the
figure
of
madame
desforges
who
had
stopped
in
the
glove
department
with
madame
guibal
despite
her
jealous
rancour
she
also
was
buying
and
he
felt
himself
to
be
the
master
once
more
having
them
at
his
feet
beneath
the
dazzle
of
the
electric
light
like
a
drove
of
cattle
from
which
he
had
drawn
his
fortune
with
a
mechanical
step
mouret
went
along
the
galleries
so
absorbed
that
he
yielded
to
the
pushing
of
the
crowd
when
he
raised
his
head
again
he
found
himself
in
the
new
millinery
department
the
windows
of
which
overlooked
the
rue
du
and
there
his
forehead
against
the
glass
he
made
another
halt
and
watched
the
departure
of
the
throng
the
setting
sun
was
tinging
the
roofs
of
the
white
houses
with
yellow
the
blue
sky
was
growing
paler
refreshed
by
a
pure
breeze
whilst
in
the
twilight
which
was
already
enveloping
the
down
below
the
electric
lamps
of
the
ladies
paradise
threw
forth
the
fixed
glimmer
of
stars
lighted
on
the
horizon
at
the
decline
of
day
towards
the
and
the
bourse
were
rows
of
waiting
vehicles
the
harness
of
the
horses
still
presenting
reflections
of
bright
light
the
gleam
of
a
lamp
the
glitter
of
a
silver
chain
at
each
minute
the
cry
of
a
messenger
was
heard
and
a
cab
drew
near
or
a
brougham
came
forth
from
the
ranks
took
up
a
customer
and
went
off
at
a
rapid
trot
the
rows
of
conveyances
were
now
diminishing
six
went
off
at
a
time
occupying
the
whole
street
from
one
side
to
the
other
amidst
the
banging
of
doors
the
snapping
of
whips
and
the
hum
of
the
who
swarmed
between
the
wheels
there
was
a
sort
of
continuous
enlargement
a
spreading
of
the
customers
carried
off
to
the
four
corners
of
the
city
as
the
building
emptied
with
the
roaring
clamour
of
a
sluice
and
the
roof
of
the
ladies
paradise
the
big
golden
letters
of
the
sky
signs
the
banners
fluttering
in
the
heavens
still
flamed
with
the
reflections
of
the
setting
sun
looking
so
colossal
in
the
oblique
light
that
they
evoked
the
thought
of
some
monster
of
advertising
some
phalansterium
whose
buildings
incessantly
multiplied
in
turn
covered
up
every
district
as
far
as
the
distant
woods
of
the
suburbs
and
the
spreading
soul
of
paris
in
a
huge
but
gentle
breath
sank
asleep
in
the
serenity
of
the
evening
hovering
in
prolonged
languid
caresses
over
the
last
vehicles
which
were
spinning
through
the
streets
now
slowly
deserted
by
the
crowd
as
it
disappeared
into
the
darkness
of
the
night
mouret
gazing
around
had
just
felt
something
grand
in
himself
but
amid
the
quiver
of
triumph
with
which
his
flesh
trembled
in
face
of
paris
devoured
and
woman
conquered
he
experienced
a
sudden
weakness
a
defection
of
his
strong
will
by
which
in
his
turn
he
was
overthrown
beneath
a
superior
force
it
was
an
unreasonable
longing
to
be
vanquished
amidst
his
victory
the
nonsense
of
a
warrior
bending
beneath
the
caprice
of
a
child
on
the
morrow
of
his
conquests
he
who
had
struggled
for
months
who
even
that
morning
had
sworn
to
stifle
his
passion
all
at
once
yielded
seized
by
the
vertigo
which
overcomes
one
on
mountain
heights
happy
to
commit
what
he
looked
upon
as
folly
his
decision
so
rapidly
arrived
at
acquired
in
a
minute
such
energy
that
he
saw
nothing
else
useful
and
necessary
in
the
world
in
the
evening
after
the
last
dinner
he
sat
waiting
in
his
office
trembling
like
a
young
man
about
to
stake
his
life
happiness
unable
to
keep
still
but
incessantly
going
towards
the
door
to
listen
to
the
hubbub
in
the
shop
where
the
employees
submerged
to
the
shoulders
in
a
sea
of
stuffs
were
now
doing
the
folding
up
at
each
footstep
his
heart
beat
and
all
at
once
he
experienced
violent
emotion
and
rushed
forward
for
he
had
heard
in
the
distance
a
deep
murmur
which
had
gradually
increased
it
was
lhomme
slowly
approaching
with
the
day
receipts
that
day
they
were
so
heavy
there
was
such
a
quantity
of
silver
and
copper
that
he
had
been
obliged
to
enlist
the
services
of
two
messengers
behind
him
came
joseph
and
one
of
his
colleagues
both
bending
beneath
the
weight
of
the
bags
enormous
bags
thrown
on
their
shoulders
like
sacks
of
plaster
whilst
he
walked
on
in
front
with
the
notes
and
gold
a
swollen
with
flimsies
and
two
bags
hung
round
his
neck
the
weight
of
which
made
him
sway
to
the
right
the
same
side
as
his
broken
arm
slowly
perspiring
and
puffing
he
had
come
from
the
other
end
of
the
shop
amidst
the
growing
emotion
of
the
salesmen
the
employees
in
the
glove
and
silk
departments
had
laughingly
offered
to
relieve
him
of
his
burden
the
men
in
the
drapery
and
woollen
departments
had
longed
to
see
him
make
a
false
step
which
would
have
scattered
the
gold
all
over
the
place
then
he
had
been
obliged
to
mount
the
stairs
and
cross
a
bridge
and
then
go
higher
still
turning
about
amidst
the
longing
looks
of
the
employees
of
the
linen
hosiery
and
mercery
departments
who
gazed
in
ecstasy
at
this
fortune
travelling
in
the
air
on
the
the
mantle
perfumery
lace
and
shawl
employees
were
ranged
devoutly
as
for
the
passage
of
the
blessed
sacrament
and
from
counter
to
counter
a
tumult
arose
like
the
clamour
of
a
nation
bowing
down
before
the
golden
calf
mouret
had
opened
the
door
and
lhomme
appeared
followed
by
the
two
messengers
who
were
staggering
and
out
of
breath
though
he
was
the
cashier
still
had
strength
to
cry
out
one
million
two
hundred
and
francs
nineteen
sous
at
last
the
million
had
been
attained
that
million
picked
up
in
a
day
of
which
mouret
had
so
long
dreamed
but
he
gave
way
to
an
angry
gesture
and
with
the
disappointed
air
of
a
man
disturbed
by
some
troublesome
visitor
he
impatiently
exclaimed
a
million
very
good
put
it
there
lhomme
knew
that
he
was
fond
of
seeing
the
heavy
receipts
on
his
table
before
they
were
taken
to
the
central
cash
office
the
million
covered
the
whole
table
crushing
the
papers
and
almost
overturning
the
ink
and
the
gold
and
the
silver
and
the
copper
running
out
of
the
sacks
and
bursting
the
leather
bags
formed
a
great
heap
the
heap
of
the
gross
receipts
such
as
it
came
still
warm
and
palpitating
from
the
customers
hands
just
as
the
cashier
was
going
away
at
the
indifference
bourdoncle
arrived
gaily
exclaiming
ah
we
got
it
this
time
we
hooked
the
million
eh
but
on
observing
mouret
febrile
air
he
understood
the
situation
and
calmed
down
his
face
was
beaming
with
delight
and
after
a
short
silence
he
resumed
you
made
up
your
mind
have
you
well
i
approve
your
decision
all
at
once
however
mouret
planted
himself
before
him
and
in
his
terrible
voice
thundered
i
say
my
man
you
rather
too
lively
you
think
me
played
out
do
you
and
you
feel
hungry
but
be
careful
i
not
one
to
be
swallowed
up
you
know
discountenanced
by
the
sharp
attack
of
this
wonderful
fellow
who
guessed
everything
bourdoncle
stammered
what
now
are
you
joking
i
who
have
always
admired
you
so
much
do
tell
lies
replied
mouret
more
violently
than
ever
just
listen
we
were
stupid
to
entertain
the
superstition
that
marriage
would
ruin
us
why
is
it
not
the
necessary
health
the
very
strength
and
order
of
life
well
my
dear
fellow
i
going
to
marry
her
and
i
pitch
you
all
out
of
doors
at
the
slightest
movement
yes
go
and
get
paid
like
the
rest
bourdoncle
and
with
a
gesture
he
dismissed
him
bourdoncle
felt
himself
condemned
swept
away
in
this
victory
gained
by
woman
he
went
off
denise
was
just
coming
in
and
he
bowed
to
her
with
profound
respect
his
head
swimming
ah
you
come
at
last
said
mouret
gently
denise
was
pale
with
emotion
she
had
just
experienced
another
grief
deloche
had
informed
her
of
his
dismissal
and
when
she
had
tried
to
retain
him
offering
to
speak
in
his
favour
he
had
obstinately
declined
to
struggle
against
his
bad
luck
he
wanted
to
disappear
he
said
what
was
the
use
of
staying
why
should
he
interfere
with
people
who
were
happy
then
denise
had
bade
him
a
sisterly
farewell
her
eyes
full
of
tears
did
she
not
herself
long
to
sink
into
oblivion
everything
was
now
about
to
finish
and
she
asked
nothing
more
of
her
exhausted
strength
than
the
courage
to
insist
on
the
separation
in
a
few
minutes
if
she
could
only
be
valiant
enough
to
crush
her
heart
she
would
be
able
to
go
away
alone
and
weep
unseen
you
wished
to
see
me
sir
she
said
in
her
calm
voice
in
fact
i
intended
to
come
and
thank
you
for
all
your
kindness
to
me
on
entering
she
had
perceived
the
million
on
the
table
and
the
display
of
that
money
wounded
her
above
her
as
if
watching
the
scene
was
the
portrait
of
madame
hédouin
in
its
gilded
frame
and
with
the
eternal
smile
of
its
painted
lips
you
are
still
resolved
to
leave
us
asked
mouret
in
a
trembling
voice
yes
sir
i
must
then
he
took
her
hands
and
in
an
outburst
of
tenderness
after
the
long
coldness
he
had
imposed
on
himself
exclaimed
and
if
i
asked
you
to
marry
me
denise
would
you
still
leave
but
she
rapidly
drew
her
hands
away
struggling
as
if
under
the
influence
of
a
great
grief
oh
monsieur
mouret
pray
say
no
more
oh
do
cause
me
even
greater
pain
than
before
i
can
not
i
can
not
heaven
is
my
witness
that
i
was
going
away
to
avoid
such
a
misfortune
she
continued
to
defend
herself
in
broken
sentences
had
she
not
already
suffered
too
much
from
the
gossip
of
the
house
did
he
wish
her
to
pass
in
the
eyes
of
others
and
his
own
for
a
worthless
woman
no
no
she
would
be
strong
she
would
certainly
prevent
him
doing
such
a
foolish
thing
he
tortured
listened
to
her
repeating
in
a
passionate
tone
i
wish
it
i
wish
it
no
it
impossible
and
my
brothers
i
have
sworn
not
to
marry
i
can
not
bring
you
those
children
can
i
they
shall
be
my
brothers
too
say
yes
denise
no
no
leave
me
you
are
torturing
me
little
by
little
he
was
losing
his
strength
this
last
obstacle
drove
him
frantic
what
she
still
refused
even
at
this
price
in
the
distance
he
heard
the
clamour
of
his
three
thousand
employees
building
up
his
immense
fortune
and
that
idiotic
million
lying
there
he
suffered
from
it
as
from
a
sort
of
irony
he
could
have
kicked
it
into
the
street
go
then
he
cried
at
last
in
a
flood
of
tears
go
and
join
the
man
you
love
that
the
reason
is
it
you
warned
me
i
ought
to
have
known
it
and
not
have
tormented
you
any
further
she
stood
there
thunderstruck
by
the
violence
of
this
despair
her
own
heart
was
bursting
and
then
with
the
impetuosity
of
a
child
she
threw
herself
on
his
neck
sobbing
also
and
stammering
oh
monsieur
mouret
it
you
i
love
a
last
murmur
was
rising
from
the
ladies
paradise
the
distant
acclamation
of
a
multitude
madame
hédouin
portrait
was
still
smiling
with
its
painted
lips
mouret
had
fallen
on
his
table
on
the
million
which
he
could
no
longer
see
he
did
not
quit
denise
but
clasped
her
to
his
breast
in
a
desperate
embrace
telling
her
that
she
might
now
go
that
she
could
spend
a
month
at
valognes
which
would
silence
everybody
and
that
then
he
would
go
to
fetch
her
himself
and
bring
her
back
as
his
wedded
wife
the
end
