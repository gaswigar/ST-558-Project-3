permit
me
to
add
your
name
to
my
name
in
publishing
this
novel
the
pen
which
has
written
my
books
can
not
be
more
agreeably
employed
than
in
acknowledging
what
i
owe
to
the
pen
which
has
skillfully
and
patiently
helped

copying

first
period
events
in
the
prison
related
by
the
governor
chapter
i
the
governor
explains
at
the
request
of
a
person
who
has
claims
on
me
that
i
must
not
disown
i
consent
to
look
back
through
a
long
interval
of
years
and
to
describe
events
which
took
place
within
the
walls
of
an
english
prison
during
the
earlier
period
of
my
appointment
as
governor
viewing
my
task
by
the
light
which
later
experience
casts
on
it
i
think
i
shall
act
wisely
by
exercising
some
control
over
the
freedom
of
my
pen
i
propose
to
pass
over
in
silence
the
name
of
the
town
in
which
is
situated
the
prison
once
confided
to
my
care
i
shall
observe
a
similar
discretion
in
alluding
to
individuals
some
dead
some
living
at
the
present
time
being
obliged
to
write
of
a
woman
who
deservedly
suffered
the
extreme
penalty
of
the
law
i
think
she
will
be
sufficiently
identified
if
i
call
her
the
prisoner
of
the
four
persons
present
on
the
evening
before
her
execution
three
may
be
distinguished
one
from
the
other
by
allusion
to
their
vocations
in
life
i
here
introduce
them
as
the
chaplain
the
minister
and
the
doctor
the
fourth
was
a
young
woman
she
has
no
claim
on
my
consideration
and
when
she
is
mentioned
her
name
may
appear
if
these
reserves
excite
suspicion
i
declare
beforehand
that
they
influence
in
no
way
the
sense
of
responsibility
which
commands
an
honest
man
to
speak
the
truth
chapter
ii
the
murderess
asks
questions
the
first
of
the
events
which
i
must
now
relate
was
the
conviction
of
the
prisoner
for
the
murder
of
her
husband
they
had
lived
together
in
matrimony
for
little
more
than
two
years
the
husband
a
gentleman
by
birth
and
education
had
mortally
offended
his
relations
in
marrying
a
woman
of
an
inferior
rank
of
life
he
was
fast
declining
into
a
state
of
poverty
through
his
own
reckless
extravagance
at
the
time
when
he
met
with
his
death
at
his
wife
s
hand
without
attempting
to
excuse
him
he
deserved
to
my
mind
some
tribute
of
regret
it
is
not
to
be
denied
that
he
was
profligate
in
his
habits
and
violent
in
his
temper
but
it
is
equally
true
that
he
was
affectionate
in
the
domestic
circle
and
when
moved
by
wisely
applied
remonstrance
sincerely
penitent
for
sins
committed
under
temptation
that
overpowered
him
if
his
wife
had
killed
him
in
a
fit
of
jealous
rage
under
provocation
be
it
remembered
which
the
witnesses
proved
she
might
have
been
convicted
of
manslaughter
and
might
have
received
a
light
sentence
but
the
evidence
so
undeniably
revealed
deliberate
and
merciless
premeditation
that
the
only
defense
attempted
by
her
counsel
was
madness
and
the
only
alternative
left
to
a
righteous
jury
was
a
verdict
which
condemned
the
woman
to
death
those
mischievous
members
of
the
community
whose
sympathies
feel
for
the
living
criminal
and
forget
the
dead
victim
attempted
to
save
her
by
means
of
petitions
and
contemptible
correspondence
in
the
newspapers
but
the
judge
held
firm
and
the
home
secretary
held
firm
they
were
entirely
right
and
the
public
were
scandalously
wrong
our
chaplain
endeavored
to
offer
the
consolations
of
religion
to
the
condemned
wretch
she
refused
to
accept
his
ministrations
in
language
which
filled
him
with
grief
and
horror
on
the
evening
before
the
execution
the
reverend
gentleman
laid
on
my
table
his
own
written
report
of
a
conversation
which
had
passed
between
the
prisoner
and
himself
i
see
some
hope
sir
he
said
of
inclining
the
heart
of
this
woman
to
religious
belief
before
it
is
too
late
will
you
read
my
report
and
say
if
you
agree
with
me
i
read
it
of
course
it
was
called
a
memorandum
and
was
thus
written
at
his
last
interview
with
the
prisoner
the
chaplain
asked
her
if
she
had
ever
entered
a
place
of
public
worship
she
replied
that
she
had
occasionally
attended
the
services
at
a
congregational
church
in
this
town
attracted
by
the
reputation
of
the
minister
as
a
preacher
he
entirely
failed
to
make
a
christian
of
me
she
said
but
i
was
struck
by
his
eloquence
besides
he
interested
me
personally
he
was
a
fine
in
the
dreadful
situation
in
which
the
woman
was
placed
such
language
as
this
shocked
the
chaplain
he
appealed
in
vain
to
the
prisoner
s
sense
of
propriety
you
don
t
understand
women
she
answered
the
greatest
saint
of
my
sex
that
ever
lived
likes
to
look
at
a
preacher
as
well
as
to
hear
him
if
he
is
an
agreeable
man
he
has
all
the
greater
effect
on
her
this
preacher
s
voice
told
me
he
was
and
i
had
only
to
look
at
his
beautiful
eyes
to
see
that
he
was
trustworthy
and
it
was
useless
to
repeat
a
protest
which
had
already
failed
recklessly
and
flippantly
as
she
had
described
it
an
impression
had
been
produced
on
her
it
occurred
to
the
chaplain
that
he
might
at
least
make
the
attempt
to
turn
this
result
to
her
own
religious
advantage
he
asked
whether
she
would
receive
the
minister
if
the
reverend
gentleman
came
to
the
prison
that
will
depend
she
said
on
whether
you
answer
some
questions
which
i
want
to
put
to
you
the
chaplain
consented
provided
always
that
he
could
reply
with
propriety
to
what
she
asked
of
him
her
first
question
only
related
to
himself
she
said
the
women
who
watch
me
tell
me
that
you
are
a
widower
and
have
a
family
of
children
is
that
true
the
chaplain
answered
that
it
was
quite
true
she
alluded
next
to
a
report
current
in
the
town
that
the
minister
had
resigned
the
pastorate
being
personally
acquainted
with
him
the
chaplain
was
able
to
inform
her
that
his
resignation
had
not
yet
been
accepted
on
hearing
this
she
seemed
to
gather
confidence
her
next
inquiries
succeeded
each
other
rapidly
as
follows
is
my
handsome
preacher
married
has
he
got
any
children
he
has
never
had
any
how
long
has
he
been
married
as
well
as
i
know
about
seven
or
eight
years
what
sort
of
woman
is
his
wife
a
lady
universally
i
don
t
care
whether
she
is
respected
or
not
is
she
kind
certainly
is
her
husband
well
off
he
has
a
sufficient
after
that
reply
the
prisoner
s
curiosity
appeared
to
be
satisfied
she
said
bring
your
friend
the
preacher
to
me
if
you
like
and
there
it
ended
what
her
object
could
have
been
in
putting
these
questions
it
seems
to
be
impossible
to
guess
having
accurately
reported
all
that
took
place
the
chaplain
declares
with
heartfelt
regret
that
he
can
exert
no
religious
influence
over
this
obdurate
woman
he
leaves
it
to
the
governor
to
decide
whether
the
minister
of
the
congregational
church
may
not
succeed
where
the
chaplain
of
the
jail
has
failed
herein
is
the
one
last
hope
of
saving
the
soul
of
the
prisoner
now
under
sentence
of
death
in
those
serious
words
the
memorandum
ended
although
not
personally
acquainted
with
the
minister
i
had
heard
of
him
on
all
sides
as
an
excellent
man
in
the
emergency
that
confronted
us
he
had
as
it
seemed
to
me
his
own
sacred
right
to
enter
the
prison
assuming
that
he
was
willing
to
accept
what
i
myself
felt
to
be
a
very
serious
responsibility
the
first
necessity
was
to
discover
whether
we
might
hope
to
obtain
his
services
with
my
full
approval
the
chaplain
left
me
to
state
the
circumstances
to
his
reverend
colleague
chapter
iii
the
child
appears
during
my
friend
s
absence
my
attention
was
claimed
by
a
sad
incident
not
unforeseen
it
is
i
suppose
generally
known
that
near
relatives
are
admitted
to
take
their
leave
of
criminals
condemned
to
death
in
the
case
of
the
prisoner
now
waiting
for
execution
no
person
applied
to
the
authorities
for
permission
to
see
her
i
myself
inquired
if
she
had
any
relations
living
and
if
she
would
like
to
see
them
she
answered
none
that
i
care
to
see
or
that
care
to
see
me
except
the
nearest
relation
of
in
those
last
words
the
miserable
creature
alluded
to
her
only
child
a
little
girl
an
infant
i
should
say
who
had
passed
her
first
year
s
birthday
by
a
few
months
the
farewell
interview
was
to
take
place
on
the
mother
s
last
evening
on
earth
and
the
child
was
now
brought
into
my
rooms
in
charge
of
her
nurse
i
had
seldom
seen
a
brighter
or
prettier
little
girl
she
was
just
able
to
walk
alone
and
to
enjoy
the
first
delight
of
moving
from
one
place
to
another
quite
of
her
own
accord
she
came
to
me
attracted
i
daresay
by
the
glitter
of
my
helping
her
to
climb
on
my
knee
i
showed
the
wonders
of
the
watch
and
held
it
to
her
ear
at
that
past
time
death
had
taken
my
good
wife
from
me
my
two
boys
were
away
at
harrow
school
my
domestic
life
was
the
life
of
a
lonely
man
whether
i
was
reminded
of
the
bygone
days
when
my
sons
were
infants
on
my
knee
listening
to
the
ticking
of
my
watch
or
whether
the
friendless
position
of
the
poor
little
creature
who
had
lost
one
parent
and
was
soon
to
lose
the
other
by
a
violent
death
moved
me
in
depths
of
pity
not
easily
reached
in
my
later
experience
i
am
not
able
to
say
this
only
i
know
my
heart
ached
for
the
child
while
she
was
laughing
and
listening
and
something
fell
from
me
on
the
watch
which
i
don
t
deny
might
have
been
a
tear
a
few
of
the
toys
mostly
broken
now
which
my
two
children
used
to
play
with
are
still
in
my
possession
kept
like
my
poor
wife
s
favorite
jewels
for
old
remembrance
sake
these
i
took
from
their
repository
when
the
attraction
of
my
watch
showed
signs
of
failing
the
child
pounced
on
them
with
her
chubby
hands
and
screamed
with
pleasure
and
the
hangman
was
waiting
for
her
mother
and
more
horrid
still
the
mother
deserved
it
my
duty
required
me
to
let
the
prisoner
know
that
her
little
daughter
had
arrived
did
that
heart
of
iron
melt
at
last
it
might
have
been
so
or
it
might
not
the
message
sent
back
kept
her
secret
all
that
it
said
to
me
was
let
the
child
wait
till
i
send
for
the
minister
had
consented
to
help
us
on
his
arrival
at
the
prison
i
received
him
privately
in
my
study
i
had
only
to
look
at
his
face
pitiably
pale
and
agitated
to
see
that
he
was
a
sensitive
man
not
always
able
to
control
his
nerves
on
occasions
which
tried
his
moral
courage
a
kind
i
might
almost
say
a
noble
face
and
a
voice
unaffectedly
persuasive
at
once
prepossessed
me
in
his
favor
the
few
words
of
welcome
that
i
spoke
were
intended
to
compose
him
they
failed
to
produce
the
impression
on
which
i
had
counted
my
experience
he
said
has
included
many
melancholy
duties
and
has
tried
my
composure
in
terrible
scenes
but
i
have
never
yet
found
myself
in
the
presence
of
an
unrepentant
criminal
sentenced
to
death
and
that
criminal
a
woman
and
a
mother
i
own
sir
that
i
am
shaken
by
the
prospect
before
i
suggested
that
he
should
wait
a
while
in
the
hope
that
time
and
quiet
might
help
him
he
thanked
me
and
refused
if
i
have
any
knowledge
of
myself
he
said
terrors
of
anticipation
lose
their
hold
when
i
am
face
to
face
with
a
serious
call
on
me
the
longer
i
remain
here
the
less
worthy
i
shall
appear
of
the
trust
that
has
been
placed
in
me
the
trust
which
please
god
i
mean
to
my
own
observation
of
human
nature
told
me
that
this
was
wisely
said
i
led
the
way
at
once
to
the
cell
chapter
iv
the
minister
says
yes
the
prisoner
was
seated
on
her
bed
quietly
talking
with
the
woman
appointed
to
watch
her
when
she
rose
to
receive
us
i
saw
the
minister
start
the
face
that
confronted
him
would
in
my
opinion
have
taken
any
man
by
surprise
if
he
had
first
happened
to
see
it
within
the
walls
of
a
prison
visitors
to
the
of
italy
growing
weary
of
holy
families
in
endless
succession
observe
that
the
idea
of
the
madonna
among
the
rank
and
file
of
italian
painters
is
limited
to
one
changeless
and
familiar
type
i
can
hardly
hope
to
be
believed
when
i
say
that
the
personal
appearance
of
the
murderess
recalled
that
type
she
presented
the
delicate
light
hair
the
quiet
eyes
the
lower
features
and
the
correctly
oval
form
of
face
repeated
in
hundreds
on
hundreds
of
the
conventional
works
of
art
to
which
i
have
ventured
to
allude
to
those
who
doubt
me
i
can
only
declare
that
what
i
have
here
written
is
undisguised
and
absolute
truth
let
me
add
that
daily
observation
of
all
classes
of
criminals
extending
over
many
years
has
considerably
diminished
my
faith
in
physiognomy
as
a
safe
guide
to
the
discovery
of
character
nervous
trepidation
looks
like
guilt
guilt
firmly
sustained
by
insensibility
looks
like
innocence
one
of
the
vilest
wretches
ever
placed
under
my
charge
won
the
sympathies
while
he
was
waiting
for
his
trial
of
every
person
who
saw
him
including
even
the
persons
employed
in
the
prison
only
the
other
day
ladies
and
gentlemen
coming
to
visit
me
passed
a
body
of
men
at
work
on
the
road
judges
of
physiognomy
among
them
were
horrified
at
the
criminal
atrocity
betrayed
in
every
face
that
they
noticed
they
condoled
with
me
on
the
near
neighborhood
of
so
many
convicts
to
my
official
place
of
residence
i
looked
out
of
the
window
and
saw
a
group
of
honest
laborers
whose
only
crime
was
poverty
employed
by
the
parish
having
instructed
the
female
warder
to
leave
the
room
but
to
take
care
that
she
waited
within
call
i
looked
again
at
the
minister
confronted
by
the
serious
responsibility
that
he
had
undertaken
he
justified
what
he
had
said
to
me
still
pale
still
distressed
he
was
now
nevertheless
master
of
himself
i
turned
to
the
door
to
leave
him
alone
with
the
prisoner
she
called
me
back
before
this
gentleman
tries
to
convert
me
she
said
i
want
you
to
wait
here
and
be
a
finding
that
we
were
both
willing
to
comply
with
this
request
she
addressed
herself
directly
to
the
minister
suppose
i
promise
to
listen
to
your
exhortations
she
began
what
do
you
promise
to
do
for
me
in
return
the
voice
in
which
she
spoke
to
him
was
steady
and
clear
a
marked
contrast
to
the
tremulous
earnestness
with
which
he
answered
her
i
promise
to
urge
you
to
repentance
and
the
confession
of
your
crime
i
promise
to
implore
the
divine
blessing
on
me
in
the
effort
to
save
your
poor
guilty
she
looked
at
him
and
listened
to
him
as
if
he
was
speaking
to
her
in
an
unknown
tongue
and
went
on
with
what
she
had
to
say
as
quietly
as
ever
when
i
am
hanged
suppose
i
die
without
confessing
without
repenting
are
you
one
of
those
who
believe
i
shall
be
doomed
to
eternal
punishment
in
another
life
i
believe
in
the
mercy
of
answer
my
question
if
you
please
is
an
impenitent
sinner
eternally
punished
do
you
believe
that
my
bible
leaves
me
no
other
she
paused
for
a
while
evidently
considering
with
special
attention
what
she
was
about
to
say
next
as
a
religious
man
she
resumed
would
you
be
willing
to
make
some
sacrifice
rather
than
let
a
go
after
a
disgraceful
death
to
everlasting
torment
i
know
of
no
sacrifice
in
my
power
he
said
fervently
to
which
i
would
not
rather
submit
than
let
you
die
in
the
present
dreadful
state
of
your
the
prisoner
turned
to
me
is
the
person
who
watches
me
waiting
outside
will
you
be
so
kind
as
to
call
her
in
i
have
a
message
for
it
was
plain
that
she
had
been
leading
the
way
to
the
delivery
of
that
message
whatever
it
might
be
in
all
that
she
had
said
up
to
the
present
time
so
far
my
poor
powers
of
penetration
helped
me
and
no
further
the
warder
appeared
and
received
her
message
tell
the
woman
who
has
come
here
with
my
little
girl
that
i
want
to
see
the
taken
completely
by
surprise
i
signed
to
the
attendant
to
wait
for
further
instructions
in
a
moment
more
i
had
sufficiently
recovered
myself
to
see
the
impropriety
of
permitting
any
obstacle
to
interpose
between
the
minister
and
his
errand
of
mercy
i
gently
reminded
the
prisoner
that
she
would
have
a
later
opportunity
of
seeing
her
child
your
first
duty
i
told
her
is
to
hear
and
to
take
to
heart
what
the
clergyman
has
to
say
to
for
the
second
time
i
attempted
to
leave
the
cell
for
the
second
time
this
impenetrable
woman
called
me
back
take
the
parson
away
with
you
she
said
i
refuse
to
listen
to
the
patient
minister
yielded
and
appealed
to
me
to
follow
his
example
i
reluctantly
sanctioned
the
delivery
of
the
message
after
a
brief
interval
the
child
was
brought
to
us
tired
and
sleepy
for
a
while
the
nurse
roused
her
by
setting
her
on
her
feet
she
happened
to
notice
the
minister
first
her
bright
eyes
rested
on
him
gravely
wondering
he
kissed
her
and
after
a
momentary
hesitation
gave
her
to
her
mother
the
horror
of
the
situation
overpowered
him
he
turned
his
face
away
from
us
i
understood
what
he
felt
he
almost
overthrew
my
own
the
prisoner
spoke
to
the
nurse
in
no
friendly
tone
you
can
the
nurse
turned
to
me
ostentatiously
ignoring
the
words
that
had
been
addressed
to
her
am
i
to
go
sir
or
to
stay
i
suggested
that
she
should
return
to
the
she
returned
at
once
in
silence
the
prisoner
looked
after
her
as
she
went
out
with
such
an
expression
of
hatred
in
her
eyes
that
the
minister
noticed
it
what
has
that
person
done
to
offend
you
he
asked
she
is
the
last
person
in
the
whole
world
whom
i
should
have
chosen
to
take
care
of
my
child
if
the
power
of
choosing
had
been
mine
but
i
have
been
in
prison
without
a
living
creature
to
represent
me
or
to
take
my
part
no
more
of
that
my
troubles
will
be
over
in
a
few
hours
more
i
want
you
to
look
at
my
little
girl
whose
troubles
are
all
to
come
do
you
call
her
pretty
do
you
feel
interested
in
her
the
sorrow
and
pity
in
his
face
answered
for
him
quietly
sleeping
the
poor
baby
rested
on
her
mother
s
bosom
was
the
heart
of
the
murderess
softened
by
the
divine
influence
of
maternal
love
the
hands
that
held
the
child
trembled
a
little
for
the
first
time
it
seemed
to
cost
her
an
effort
to
compose
herself
before
she
could
speak
to
the
minister
again
when
i
die
she
said
i
leave
my
child
helpless
and
friendless
disgraced
by
her
mother
s
shameful
death
the
workhouse
may
take
her
or
a
charitable
asylum
may
take
she
paused
a
first
tinge
of
color
rose
on
her
pale
face
she
broke
into
an
outburst
of
rage
think
of
daughter
being
brought
up
by
charity
she
may
suffer
poverty
she
may
be
treated
with
contempt
she
may
be
employed
by
brutal
people
in
menial
work
i
can
t
endure
it
it
maddens
me
if
she
is
not
saved
from
that
wretched
fate
i
shall
die
despairing
i
shall
die
cursing
the
minister
sternly
stopped
her
before
she
could
say
the
next
word
to
my
astonishment
she
appeared
to
be
humbled
to
be
even
ashamed
she
asked
his
pardon
forgive
me
i
won
t
forget
myself
again
they
tell
me
you
have
no
children
of
your
own
is
that
a
sorrow
to
you
and
your
wife
her
altered
tone
touched
him
he
answered
sadly
and
kindly
it
is
the
one
sorrow
of
our
the
purpose
which
she
had
been
keeping
in
view
from
the
moment
when
the
minister
entered
her
cell
was
no
mystery
now
ought
i
to
have
interfered
let
me
confess
a
weakness
unworthy
perhaps
of
my
office
i
was
so
sorry
for
the
child
i
hesitated
my
silence
encouraged
the
mother
she
advanced
to
the
minister
with
the
sleeping
infant
in
her
arms
i
daresay
you
have
sometimes
thought
of
adopting
a
child
she
said
perhaps
you
can
guess
now
what
i
had
in
my
mind
when
i
asked
if
you
would
consent
to
a
sacrifice
will
you
take
this
wretched
innocent
little
creature
home
with
you
she
lost
her
once
more
a
motherless
creature
she
burst
out
think
of
god
knows
how
i
still
shrunk
from
it
but
there
was
no
alternative
now
i
was
bound
to
remember
my
duty
to
the
excellent
man
whose
critical
position
at
that
moment
was
in
some
degree
at
least
due
to
my
hesitation
in
asserting
my
authority
could
i
allow
the
prisoner
to
presume
on
his
compassionate
nature
and
to
hurry
him
into
a
decision
which
in
his
calmer
moments
he
might
find
reason
to
regret
i
spoke
to
does
the
man
live
who
having
to
say
what
i
had
to
say
could
have
spoken
to
the
doomed
mother
i
am
sorry
to
have
allowed
this
to
go
on
i
said
in
justice
to
yourself
sir
don
t
answer
she
turned
on
me
with
a
look
of
fury
he
shall
answer
she
cried
i
saw
or
thought
i
saw
signs
of
yielding
in
his
face
take
time
i
persisted
take
time
to
consider
before
you
she
stepped
up
to
me
take
time
she
repeated
are
you
inhuman
enough
to
talk
of
time
in
my
presence
she
laid
the
sleeping
child
on
her
bed
and
fell
on
her
knees
before
the
minister
i
promise
to
hear
your
exhortations
i
promise
to
do
all
a
woman
can
to
believe
and
repent
oh
i
know
myself
my
heart
once
hardened
is
a
heart
that
no
human
creature
can
touch
the
one
way
to
my
better
nature
if
i
have
a
better
nature
is
through
that
poor
babe
save
her
from
the
workhouse
don
t
let
them
make
a
pauper
of
her
she
sank
prostrate
at
his
feet
and
beat
her
hands
in
frenzy
on
the
floor
you
want
to
save
my
guilty
soul
she
reminded
him
furiously
there
s
but
one
way
of
doing
it
save
my
child
he
raised
her
her
fierce
tearless
eyes
questioned
his
face
in
a
mute
expectation
dreadful
to
see
suddenly
a
foretaste
of
death
the
death
that
was
so
near
now
struck
her
with
a
shivering
fit
her
head
dropped
on
the
minister
s
shoulder
other
men
might
have
shrunk
from
the
contact
of
it
that
true
christian
let
it
rest
under
the
maddening
sting
of
suspense
her
sinking
energies
rallied
for
an
instant
in
a
whisper
she
was
just
able
to
put
the
supreme
question
to
him
yes
or
no
he
answered
a
faint
breath
of
relief
just
audible
in
the
silence
told
me
that
she
had
heard
him
it
was
her
last
effort
he
laid
her
insensible
on
the
bed
by
the
side
of
her
sleeping
child
look
at
them
was
all
he
said
to
me
how
could
i
refuse
chapter
miss
chance
asserts
herself
the
services
of
our
medical
officer
were
required
in
order
to
hasten
the
recovery
of
the
prisoner
s
senses
when
the
doctor
and
i
left
the
cell
together
she
was
composed
and
ready
in
the
performance
of
her
promise
to
listen
to
the
exhortations
of
the
minister
the
sleeping
child
was
left
undisturbed
by
the
mother
s
desire
if
the
minister
felt
tempted
to
regret
what
he
had
done
there
was
the
artless
influence
which
would
check
him
as
we
stepped
into
the
corridor
i
gave
the
female
warder
her
instructions
to
remain
on
the
watch
and
to
return
to
her
post
when
she
saw
the
minister
come
out
in
the
meantime
my
companion
had
walked
on
a
little
way
possessed
of
ability
and
experience
within
the
limits
of
his
profession
he
was
in
other
respects
a
man
with
a
crotchety
mind
bold
to
the
verge
of
recklessness
in
the
expression
of
his
opinion
and
possessed
of
a
command
of
language
that
carried
everything
before
it
let
me
add
that
he
was
just
and
merciful
in
his
intercourse
with
others
and
i
shall
have
summed
him
up
fairly
enough
when
i
joined
him
he
seemed
to
be
absorbed
in
reflection
thinking
of
the
prisoner
i
said
thinking
of
what
is
going
on
at
this
moment
in
the
condemned
cell
he
answered
and
wondering
if
any
good
will
come
of
i
was
not
without
hope
of
a
good
result
and
i
said
so
the
doctor
disagreed
with
me
i
don
t
believe
in
that
woman
s
penitence
he
remarked
and
i
look
upon
the
parson
as
a
poor
weak
creature
what
is
to
become
of
the
child
there
was
no
reason
for
concealing
from
one
of
my
colleagues
the
benevolent
decision
on
the
part
of
the
good
minister
of
which
i
had
been
a
witness
the
doctor
listened
to
me
with
the
first
appearance
of
downright
astonishment
that
i
had
ever
observed
in
his
face
when
i
had
done
he
made
an
extraordinary
reply
governor
i
retract
what
i
said
of
the
parson
just
now
he
is
one
of
the
boldest
men
that
ever
stepped
into
a
was
the
doctor
in
earnest
strongly
in
earnest
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
it
before
i
could
ask
him
what
he
meant
he
was
called
away
to
a
patient
on
the
other
side
of
the
prison
when
we
parted
at
the
door
of
my
room
i
made
it
a
request
that
my
medical
friend
would
return
to
me
and
explain
what
he
had
just
said
considering
that
you
are
the
governor
of
a
prison
he
replied
you
are
a
singularly
rash
man
if
i
come
back
how
do
you
know
i
shall
not
bore
you
my
rashness
runs
the
risk
of
that
i
rejoined
tell
me
something
before
i
allow
you
to
run
your
risk
he
said
are
you
one
of
those
people
who
think
that
the
tempers
of
children
are
formed
by
the
accidental
influences
which
happen
to
be
about
them
or
do
you
agree
with
me
that
the
tempers
of
children
are
inherited
from
their
parents
the
doctor
as
i
concluded
was
still
strongly
impressed
by
the
minister
s
resolution
to
adopt
a
child
whose
wicked
mother
had
committed
the
most
atrocious
of
all
crimes
was
some
serious
foreboding
in
secret
possession
of
his
mind
my
curiosity
to
hear
him
was
now
increased
tenfold
i
replied
without
hesitation
i
agree
with
he
looked
at
me
with
his
sense
of
humor
twinkling
in
his
eyes
do
you
know
i
rather
expected
that
answer
he
said
slyly
all
right
i
ll
come
left
by
myself
i
took
up
the
day
s
newspaper
my
attention
wandered
my
thoughts
were
in
the
cell
with
the
minister
and
the
prisoner
how
would
it
end
sometimes
i
was
inclined
to
doubt
with
the
doctor
sometimes
i
took
refuge
in
my
own
more
hopeful
view
these
idle
reflections
were
agreeably
interrupted
by
the
appearance
of
my
friend
the
chaplain
you
are
always
welcome
i
said
and
doubly
welcome
just
now
i
am
feeling
a
little
worried
and
and
you
are
naturally
the
chaplain
added
not
at
all
disposed
to
receive
a
stranger
is
the
stranger
a
friend
of
yours
i
asked
oh
no
having
occasion
just
now
to
go
into
the
i
found
a
young
woman
there
who
asked
me
if
she
could
see
you
she
thinks
you
have
forgotten
her
and
she
is
tired
of
waiting
i
merely
undertook
of
course
to
mention
what
she
had
said
to
the
nurse
having
been
in
this
way
recalled
to
my
memory
i
felt
some
little
interest
in
seeing
her
after
what
had
passed
in
the
cell
in
plainer
words
i
was
desirous
of
judging
for
myself
whether
she
deserved
the
hostile
feeling
which
the
prisoner
had
shown
toward
her
i
thanked
the
chaplain
before
he
left
me
and
gave
the
servant
the
necessary
instructions
when
she
entered
the
room
i
looked
at
the
woman
attentively
for
the
first
time
youth
and
a
fine
complexion
a
figure
and
a
natural
grace
of
movement
these
were
her
personal
attractions
so
far
as
i
could
see
her
defects
were
to
my
mind
equally
noticeable
under
a
heavy
forehead
her
piercing
eyes
looked
out
at
persons
and
things
with
an
expression
which
was
not
to
my
taste
her
large
mouth
another
defect
in
my
opinion
would
have
been
recommended
to
mercy
in
the
estimation
of
many
men
by
her
magnificent
teeth
white
cruelly
regular
believers
in
physiognomy
might
perhaps
have
seen
the
betrayal
of
an
obstinate
nature
in
the
lengthy
firmness
of
her
chin
while
i
am
trying
to
describe
her
let
me
not
forget
her
dress
a
woman
s
dress
is
the
mirror
in
which
we
may
see
the
reflection
of
a
woman
s
nature
bearing
in
mind
the
melancholy
and
impressive
circumstances
under
which
she
had
brought
the
child
to
the
prison
the
gayety
of
color
in
her
gown
and
her
bonnet
implied
either
a
total
want
of
feeling
or
a
total
want
of
tact
as
to
her
position
in
life
let
me
confess
that
i
felt
after
a
closer
examination
at
a
loss
to
determine
it
she
was
certainly
not
a
lady
the
prisoner
had
spoken
of
her
as
if
she
was
a
domestic
servant
who
had
forfeited
her
right
to
consideration
and
respect
and
she
had
entered
the
prison
as
a
nurse
might
have
entered
it
in
charge
of
a
child
i
did
what
we
all
do
when
we
are
not
clever
enough
to
find
the
answer
to
a
riddle
i
gave
it
up
what
can
i
do
for
you
i
asked
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
she
answered
how
much
longer
i
am
to
be
kept
waiting
in
this
the
decision
i
reminded
her
doesn
t
depend
on
then
who
does
it
depend
on
the
minister
had
undoubtedly
acquired
the
sole
right
of
deciding
it
was
for
him
to
say
whether
this
woman
should
or
should
not
remain
in
attendance
on
the
child
whom
he
had
adopted
in
the
meanwhile
the
feeling
of
distrust
which
was
gaining
on
my
mind
warned
me
to
remember
the
value
of
reserve
in
holding
intercourse
with
a
stranger
she
seemed
to
be
irritated
by
my
silence
if
the
decision
doesn
t
rest
with
you
she
asked
why
did
you
tell
me
to
stay
in
the
you
brought
the
little
girl
into
the
prison
i
said
was
it
not
natural
to
suppose
that
your
mistress
might
want
you
stop
sir
i
had
evidently
given
offense
i
stopped
directly
no
person
on
the
face
of
the
earth
she
declared
loftily
has
ever
had
the
right
to
call
herself
my
mistress
of
my
own
free
will
sir
i
took
charge
of
the
because
you
are
fond
of
her
i
suggested
i
hate
it
was
unwise
on
my
part
i
protested
hate
a
baby
little
more
than
a
year
old
i
said
baby
she
said
it
with
the
air
of
a
woman
who
had
produced
an
unanswerable
reason
i
am
accountable
to
nobody
she
went
on
if
i
consented
to
trouble
myself
with
the
child
it
was
in
remembrance
of
my
friendship
notice
if
you
please
that
i
say
friendship
with
the
unhappy
putting
together
what
i
had
just
heard
and
what
i
had
seen
in
the
cell
i
drew
the
right
conclusion
at
last
the
woman
whose
position
in
life
had
been
thus
far
an
impenetrable
mystery
to
me
now
stood
revealed
as
one
among
other
objects
of
the
prisoner
s
jealousy
during
her
disastrous
married
life
a
serious
doubt
occurred
to
me
as
to
the
authority
under
which
the
husband
s
mistress
might
be
acting
after
the
husband
s
death
i
instantly
put
it
to
the
test
do
i
understand
you
to
assert
any
claim
to
the
child
i
asked
claim
she
repeated
i
know
no
more
of
the
child
than
you
do
i
heard
for
the
first
time
that
such
a
creature
was
in
existence
when
her
murdered
father
sent
for
me
in
his
dying
moments
at
his
entreaty
i
promised
to
take
care
of
her
while
her
vile
mother
was
out
of
the
house
and
in
the
hands
of
the
law
my
promise
has
been
performed
if
i
am
expected
having
brought
her
to
the
prison
to
take
her
away
again
understand
this
i
am
under
no
obligation
even
if
i
could
afford
it
to
burden
myself
with
that
child
i
shall
hand
her
over
to
the
workhouse
i
forgot
myself
once
more
i
lost
my
temper
leave
the
room
i
said
your
unworthy
hands
will
not
touch
the
poor
baby
again
she
is
provided
i
don
t
believe
you
the
wretch
burst
out
who
has
taken
the
child
a
quiet
voice
answered
have
taken
we
both
looked
round
and
saw
the
minister
standing
in
the
open
doorway
with
the
child
in
his
arms
the
ordeal
that
he
had
gone
through
in
the
condemned
cell
was
visible
in
his
face
he
looked
miserably
haggard
and
broken
i
was
eager
to
know
if
his
merciful
interest
in
the
prisoner
had
purified
her
guilty
soul
but
at
the
same
time
i
was
afraid
after
what
he
had
but
too
plainly
suffered
to
ask
him
to
enter
into
details
only
one
word
i
said
are
your
anxieties
at
rest
god
s
mercy
has
helped
me
he
answered
i
have
not
spoken
in
vain
she
believes
she
repents
she
has
confessed
the
after
handing
the
written
and
signed
confession
to
me
he
approached
the
venomous
creature
still
lingering
in
the
room
to
hear
what
passed
between
us
before
i
could
stop
him
he
spoke
to
her
under
a
natural
impression
that
he
was
addressing
the
prisoner
s
servant
i
am
afraid
you
will
be
disappointed
he
said
when
i
tell
you
that
your
services
will
no
longer
be
required
i
have
reasons
for
placing
the
child
under
the
care
of
a
nurse
of
my
own
she
listened
with
an
evil
smile
i
know
who
furnished
you
with
your
reasons
she
answered
apologies
are
quite
needless
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
if
you
had
proposed
to
me
to
look
after
the
new
member
of
your
family
there
i
should
have
felt
it
my
duty
to
myself
to
have
refused
i
am
not
a
nurse
i
am
an
independent
single
lady
i
see
by
your
dress
that
you
are
a
clergyman
allow
me
to
present
myself
as
a
mark
of
respect
to
your
cloth
i
am
miss
elizabeth
chance
may
i
ask
the
favor
of
your
name
too
weary
and
too
preoccupied
to
notice
the
insolence
of
her
manner
the
minister
mentioned
his
name
i
am
anxious
he
said
to
know
if
the
child
has
been
baptized
perhaps
you
can
enlighten
me
still
insolent
miss
elizabeth
chance
shook
her
head
carelessly
i
never
heard
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
never
cared
to
hear
whether
she
was
christened
or
not
call
her
by
what
name
you
like
i
can
tell
you
this
you
will
find
your
adopted
daughter
a
heavy
the
minister
turned
to
me
what
does
she
mean
i
will
try
to
tell
you
miss
chance
interposed
being
a
clergyman
you
know
who
deborah
was
very
well
i
am
deborah
now
and
she
pointed
to
the
child
remember
what
i
say
reverend
sir
you
will
find
the
take
after
its
with
those
parting
words
she
favored
us
with
a
low
curtsey
and
left
the
room
chapter
vi
the
doctor
doubts
the
minister
looked
at
me
in
an
absent
manner
his
attention
seemed
to
have
been
wandering
what
was
it
miss
chance
said
he
asked
before
i
could
speak
a
friend
s
voice
at
the
door
interrupted
us
the
doctor
returning
to
me
as
he
had
promised
answered
the
minister
s
question
in
these
words
i
must
have
passed
the
person
you
mean
sir
as
i
was
coming
in
here
and
i
heard
her
say
you
will
find
the
take
after
its
if
she
had
known
how
to
put
her
meaning
into
good
english
miss
chance
that
is
the
name
you
mentioned
i
think
might
have
told
you
that
the
vices
of
the
parents
are
inherited
by
the
children
and
the
one
particular
parent
she
had
in
her
mind
the
doctor
continued
gently
patting
the
child
s
cheek
was
no
doubt
the
mother
of
this
unfortunate
little
creature
who
may
or
may
not
live
to
show
you
that
she
comes
of
a
bad
stock
and
inherits
a
wicked
i
was
on
the
point
of
protesting
against
my
friend
s
interpretation
when
the
minister
stopped
me
let
me
thank
you
sir
for
your
explanation
he
said
to
the
doctor
as
soon
as
my
mind
is
free
i
will
reflect
on
what
you
have
said
forgive
me
governor
he
went
on
if
i
leave
you
now
that
i
have
placed
the
prisoner
s
confession
in
your
hands
it
has
been
an
effort
to
me
to
say
the
little
i
have
said
since
i
first
entered
this
room
i
can
think
of
nothing
but
that
unhappy
criminal
and
the
death
that
she
must
die
does
she
wish
you
to
be
present
i
asked
she
positively
forbids
it
after
what
you
have
done
for
me
she
said
the
least
i
can
do
in
return
is
to
prevent
your
being
needlessly
she
took
leave
of
me
she
kissed
the
little
girl
for
the
last
time
oh
don
t
ask
me
to
tell
you
about
it
i
shall
break
down
if
i
try
come
my
darling
he
kissed
the
child
tenderly
and
took
her
away
with
him
that
man
is
a
strange
compound
of
strength
and
weakness
the
doctor
remarked
did
you
notice
his
face
just
now
nine
men
out
of
ten
suffering
as
he
suffered
would
have
failed
to
control
themselves
such
resolution
as
his
conquer
the
difficulties
that
are
in
store
for
him
it
was
a
trial
of
my
temper
to
hear
my
clever
colleague
justifying
in
this
way
the
ignorant
prediction
of
an
insolent
woman
there
are
exceptions
to
all
rules
i
insisted
and
why
are
the
virtues
of
the
parents
not
just
as
likely
to
descend
to
the
children
as
the
vices
there
was
a
fund
of
good
i
can
tell
you
in
that
poor
baby
s
father
though
i
don
t
deny
that
he
was
a
profligate
man
and
even
the
horrible
mother
as
you
heard
just
now
has
virtue
enough
left
in
her
to
feel
grateful
to
the
man
who
has
taken
care
of
her
child
these
are
facts
you
can
t
dispute
the
doctor
took
out
his
pipe
do
you
mind
my
smoking
he
asked
tobacco
helps
me
to
arrange
my
i
gave
him
the
means
of
arranging
his
ideas
that
is
to
say
i
gave
him
the
he
blew
some
preliminary
clouds
of
smoke
and
then
he
answered
me
for
twenty
years
past
my
friend
i
have
been
studying
the
question
of
hereditary
transmission
of
qualities
and
i
have
found
vices
and
diseases
descending
more
frequently
to
children
than
virtue
and
health
i
don
t
stop
to
ask
why
there
is
no
end
to
that
sort
of
curiosity
what
i
have
observed
is
what
i
tell
you
no
more
and
no
less
you
will
say
this
is
a
horribly
discouraging
result
of
experience
for
it
tends
to
show
that
children
come
into
the
world
at
a
disadvantage
on
the
day
of
their
birth
of
course
they
do
children
are
born
deformed
children
are
born
deaf
dumb
or
blind
children
are
born
with
the
seeds
in
them
of
deadly
diseases
who
can
account
for
the
cruelties
of
creation
why
are
we
endowed
with
life
only
to
end
in
death
and
does
it
ever
strike
you
when
you
are
cutting
your
mutton
at
dinner
and
your
cat
is
catching
its
mouse
and
your
spider
is
suffocating
its
fly
that
we
are
all
big
and
little
together
born
to
one
certain
inheritance
the
privilege
of
eating
each
other
very
sad
i
admitted
but
it
will
all
be
set
right
in
another
are
you
quite
sure
of
that
the
doctor
asked
quite
sure
thank
god
and
it
would
be
better
for
you
if
you
felt
about
it
as
i
we
won
t
dispute
my
dear
governor
i
don
t
scoff
at
comforting
hopes
i
don
t
deny
the
existence
of
occasional
compensations
but
i
do
see
nevertheless
that
evil
has
got
the
upper
hand
among
us
on
this
curious
little
planet
judging
by
my
observation
and
experience
that
baby
s
chance
of
inheriting
the
virtues
of
her
parents
is
not
to
be
compared
with
her
chances
of
inheriting
their
vices
especially
if
she
happens
to
take
after
her
mother
the
virtue
is
not
conspicuous
and
the
vice
is
one
enormous
fact
when
i
think
of
the
growth
of
that
poisonous
hereditary
taint
which
may
come
with
time
when
i
think
of
passions
let
loose
and
temptations
lying
in
ambush
i
see
the
smooth
surface
of
the
minister
s
domestic
life
with
dangers
lurking
under
it
which
make
me
shake
in
my
shoes
god
what
a
life
i
should
lead
if
i
happened
to
be
in
his
place
some
years
hence
suppose
i
said
or
did
something
in
the
just
exercise
of
my
parental
authority
which
offended
my
adopted
daughter
what
figure
would
rise
from
the
dead
in
my
memory
when
the
girl
bounced
out
of
the
room
in
a
rage
the
image
of
her
mother
would
be
the
image
i
should
see
i
should
remember
what
her
mother
did
when
was
provoked
i
should
lock
my
bedroom
door
in
my
own
house
at
night
i
should
come
down
to
breakfast
with
suspicions
in
my
cup
of
tea
if
i
discovered
that
my
adopted
daughter
had
poured
it
out
oh
yes
it
s
quite
true
that
i
might
be
doing
the
girl
a
cruel
injustice
all
the
time
but
how
am
i
to
be
sure
of
that
i
am
only
sure
that
her
mother
was
hanged
for
one
of
the
most
merciless
murders
committed
in
our
time
pass
the
my
pipe
s
out
and
my
confession
of
faith
has
come
to
an
it
was
useless
to
dispute
with
a
man
who
possessed
his
command
of
language
at
the
same
time
there
was
a
bright
side
to
the
poor
minister
s
prospects
which
the
doctor
had
failed
to
see
it
was
barely
possible
that
i
might
succeed
in
putting
my
positive
friend
in
the
wrong
i
tried
the
experiment
at
any
rate
you
seem
to
have
forgotten
i
reminded
him
that
the
child
will
have
every
advantage
that
education
can
offer
to
her
and
will
be
accustomed
from
her
earliest
years
to
restraining
and
purifying
influences
in
a
clergyman
s
now
that
he
was
enjoying
the
fumes
of
tobacco
the
doctor
was
as
placid
and
as
a
man
could
be
quite
true
he
said
do
you
doubt
the
influence
of
religion
i
asked
sternly
he
answered
sweetly
not
at
all
or
the
influence
of
kindness
oh
dear
no
or
the
force
of
example
i
wouldn
t
deny
it
for
the
i
had
not
expected
this
extraordinary
docility
the
doctor
had
got
the
upper
hand
of
me
again
a
state
of
things
that
i
might
have
found
it
hard
to
endure
but
for
a
call
of
duty
which
put
an
end
to
our
sitting
one
of
the
female
warders
appeared
with
a
message
from
the
condemned
cell
the
prisoner
wished
to
see
the
governor
and
the
medical
officer
is
she
ill
the
doctor
inquired
no
hysterical
or
agitated
perhaps
as
easy
and
composed
sir
as
a
person
can
we
set
forth
together
for
the
condemned
cell
chapter
vii
the
murderess
consults
the
authorities
there
was
a
considerate
side
to
my
friend
s
character
which
showed
itself
when
the
warder
had
left
us
he
was
especially
anxious
to
be
careful
of
what
he
said
to
a
woman
in
the
prisoner
s
terrible
situation
especially
in
the
event
of
her
having
been
really
subjected
to
the
influence
of
religious
belief
on
the
minister
s
own
authority
i
declared
that
there
was
every
reason
to
adopt
this
conclusion
and
in
support
of
what
i
had
said
i
showed
him
the
confession
it
only
contained
a
few
lines
acknowledging
that
she
had
committed
the
murder
and
that
she
deserved
her
sentence
from
the
planning
of
the
crime
to
the
commission
of
the
crime
i
was
in
my
right
senses
throughout
i
knew
what
i
was
with
that
remarkable
disavowal
of
the
defense
set
up
by
her
advocate
the
confession
ended
my
colleague
read
the
paper
and
handed
it
back
to
me
without
making
any
remark
i
asked
if
he
suspected
the
prisoner
of
feigning
conversion
to
please
the
minister
she
shall
not
discover
it
he
answered
gravely
if
i
it
would
not
be
true
to
say
that
the
doctor
s
obstinacy
had
shaken
my
belief
in
the
good
result
of
the
minister
s
interference
i
may
however
acknowledge
that
i
felt
some
misgivings
which
were
not
dispelled
when
i
found
myself
in
the
presence
of
the
prisoner
i
had
expected
to
see
her
employed
in
reading
the
bible
the
good
book
was
closed
and
was
not
even
placed
within
her
reach
the
occupation
to
which
she
was
devoting
herself
astonished
and
repelled
me
some
carelessness
on
the
part
of
the
attendant
had
left
on
the
table
the
writing
materials
that
had
been
needed
for
her
confession
she
was
using
them
now
when
death
on
the
scaffold
was
literally
within
a
few
hours
of
her
to
sketch
a
portrait
of
the
female
warder
who
was
on
the
watch
the
doctor
and
i
looked
at
each
other
and
now
the
sincerity
of
her
repentance
was
something
that
i
began
to
question
too
she
laid
down
the
pen
and
proceeded
quietly
to
explain
herself
even
the
little
time
that
is
left
to
me
proves
to
be
a
weary
time
to
get
through
she
said
i
am
making
a
last
use
of
the
talent
for
drawing
and
catching
a
likeness
which
has
been
one
of
my
gifts
since
i
was
a
girl
you
look
as
if
you
didn
t
approve
of
such
employment
as
this
for
a
woman
who
is
going
to
be
hanged
well
sir
i
have
no
doubt
you
are
she
paused
and
tore
up
the
portrait
if
i
have
misbehaved
myself
she
resumed
i
make
amends
to
find
you
in
an
indulgent
frame
of
mind
is
of
importance
to
me
just
now
i
have
a
favor
to
ask
of
you
may
the
warder
leave
the
cell
for
a
few
minutes
giving
the
woman
permission
to
withdraw
for
a
while
i
waited
with
some
anxiety
to
hear
what
the
prisoner
wanted
of
me
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
she
proceeded
on
the
subject
of
executions
the
face
of
a
person
who
is
going
to
be
hanged
is
hidden
as
i
have
been
told
by
a
white
cap
drawn
over
it
is
that
true
how
another
man
might
have
felt
in
my
place
i
can
not
of
course
say
to
my
mind
such
a
question
on
lips
was
too
shocking
to
be
answered
in
words
i
bowed
and
the
body
is
buried
she
went
on
in
the
prison
i
could
remain
silent
no
longer
is
there
no
human
feeling
left
in
you
i
burst
out
what
do
these
horrid
questions
mean
don
t
be
angry
with
me
sir
you
shall
hear
directly
i
want
to
know
first
if
i
am
to
be
buried
in
the
prison
i
replied
as
before
by
a
bow
now
she
said
i
may
tell
you
what
i
mean
in
the
autumn
of
last
year
i
was
taken
to
see
some
waxworks
portraits
of
criminals
were
among
them
there
was
one
portrait
she
hesitated
her
infernal
failed
her
at
last
the
color
left
her
face
she
was
no
longer
able
to
look
at
me
firmly
there
was
one
portrait
she
resumed
that
had
been
taken
after
the
execution
the
face
was
so
hideous
it
was
swollen
to
such
a
size
in
its
frightful
deformity
oh
sir
don
t
let
me
be
seen
in
that
state
even
by
the
strangers
who
bury
me
use
your
influence
forbid
them
to
take
the
cap
off
my
face
when
i
am
dead
order
them
to
bury
me
in
it
and
i
swear
to
you
i
ll
meet
death
tomorrow
as
coolly
as
the
boldest
man
that
ever
mounted
the
scaffold
before
i
could
stop
her
she
seized
me
by
the
hand
and
wrung
it
with
a
furious
power
that
left
the
mark
of
her
grasp
on
me
in
a
bruise
for
days
afterward
will
you
do
it
she
cried
you
re
an
honorable
man
you
will
keep
your
word
give
me
your
promise
i
gave
her
my
promise
the
relief
to
her
tortured
spirit
expressed
itself
horribly
in
a
burst
of
frantic
laughter
i
can
t
help
it
she
gasped
i
m
so
my
enemies
said
of
me
when
i
got
my
appointment
that
i
was
too
excitable
a
man
to
be
governor
of
a
prison
perhaps
they
were
not
altogether
wrong
anyhow
the
doctor
saw
some
change
in
me
which
i
was
not
aware
of
myself
he
took
my
arm
and
led
me
out
of
the
cell
leave
her
to
me
he
whispered
the
fine
edge
of
my
nerves
was
worn
off
long
ago
in
the
when
we
met
again
i
asked
what
had
passed
between
the
prisoner
and
himself
i
gave
her
time
to
recover
he
told
me
and
except
that
she
looked
a
little
paler
than
usual
there
was
no
trace
left
of
the
frenzy
that
you
remember
i
ought
to
apologize
for
troubling
you
she
said
but
it
is
perhaps
natural
that
i
should
think
now
and
then
of
what
is
to
happen
to
me
morning
as
a
medical
man
you
will
be
able
to
enlighten
me
is
death
by
hanging
a
painful
death
she
had
put
it
so
politely
that
i
felt
bound
to
answer
her
if
the
neck
happens
to
be
broken
i
said
hanging
is
a
sudden
death
fright
and
pain
if
there
is
any
pain
are
both
over
in
an
instant
as
to
the
other
form
of
death
which
is
also
possible
i
mean
death
by
suffocation
i
must
own
as
an
honest
man
that
i
know
no
more
about
it
than
you
after
considering
a
little
she
made
a
sensible
remark
and
followed
it
by
an
embarrassing
request
a
great
deal
she
said
must
depend
on
the
executioner
i
am
not
afraid
of
death
doctor
why
should
i
be
my
anxiety
about
my
little
girl
is
set
at
rest
i
have
nothing
left
to
live
for
but
i
don
t
like
pain
would
you
mind
telling
the
executioner
to
be
careful
or
would
it
be
better
if
i
spoke
to
him
myself
i
said
i
thought
it
would
come
with
a
better
grace
from
herself
she
understood
me
directly
and
we
dropped
the
subject
are
you
surprised
at
her
coolness
after
your
experience
of
her
i
confessed
that
i
was
surprised
think
a
little
the
doctor
said
the
one
sensitive
place
in
that
woman
s
nature
is
the
place
occupied
by
her
i
objected
to
this
that
she
had
shown
fondness
for
her
child
my
friend
disposed
of
the
objection
with
his
customary
readiness
the
maternal
instinct
he
said
a
cat
is
fond
of
her
kittens
a
cow
is
fond
of
her
calf
no
sir
the
one
cause
of
that
outbreak
of
passion
which
so
shocked
you
a
genuine
outbreak
beyond
all
doubt
is
to
be
found
in
the
vanity
of
a
fine
feminine
creature
overpowered
by
a
horror
of
looking
hideous
even
after
her
death
do
you
know
i
rather
like
that
woman
is
it
possible
that
you
are
in
earnest
i
asked
i
know
as
well
as
you
do
he
answered
that
this
is
neither
a
time
nor
a
place
for
jesting
the
fact
is
the
prisoner
carries
out
an
idea
of
mine
it
is
my
positive
conviction
that
the
worst
murders
i
mean
murders
deliberately
planned
are
committed
by
persons
absolutely
deficient
in
that
part
of
the
moral
organization
which
the
night
before
they
are
hanged
they
sleep
on
their
last
morning
they
eat
a
breakfast
incapable
of
realizing
the
horror
of
murder
they
are
incapable
of
realizing
the
horror
of
death
do
you
remember
the
last
murderer
who
was
hanged
here
a
gentleman
s
coachman
who
killed
his
wife
he
had
but
two
anxieties
while
he
was
waiting
for
execution
one
was
to
get
his
allowance
of
beer
doubled
and
the
other
was
to
be
hanged
in
his
coachman
s
livery
no
no
these
wretches
are
all
alike
they
are
human
creatures
born
with
the
temperaments
of
tigers
take
my
word
for
it
we
need
feel
no
anxiety
about
the
prisoner
will
face
the
crowd
round
the
scaffold
with
composure
and
the
people
will
say
she
died
chapter
viii
the
minister
says
the
capital
punishment
of
the
prisoner
is
in
no
respect
connected
with
my
purpose
in
writing
the
present
narrative
neither
do
i
desire
to
darken
these
pages
by
describing
in
detail
an
act
of
righteous
retribution
which
must
present
by
the
nature
of
it
a
scene
of
horror
for
these
reasons
i
ask
to
be
excused
if
i
limit
what
i
must
needs
say
of
the
execution
within
the
compass
of
a
few
words
and
pass
on
the
one
person
among
us
was
the
miserable
woman
who
suffered
the
penalty
of
death
not
very
discreetly
as
i
think
the
chaplain
asked
her
if
she
had
truly
repented
she
answered
i
have
confessed
the
crime
sir
what
more
do
you
want
to
my
mind
still
hesitating
between
the
view
that
believes
with
the
minister
and
the
view
that
doubts
with
the
doctor
this
reply
leaves
a
way
open
to
hope
of
her
salvation
her
last
words
to
me
as
she
mounted
the
steps
of
the
scaffold
were
remember
your
it
was
easy
for
me
to
be
true
to
my
word
at
that
bygone
time
no
difficulties
were
placed
in
my
way
by
such
precautions
as
are
now
observed
in
the
conduct
of
executions
within
the
walls
of
the
prison
from
the
time
of
her
death
to
the
time
of
her
burial
no
living
creature
saw
her
face
she
rests
veiled
in
her
prison
grave
let
me
now
turn
to
living
interests
and
to
scenes
removed
from
the
of
crime
on
the
next
day
i
received
a
visit
from
the
minister
his
first
words
entreated
me
not
to
allude
to
the
terrible
event
of
the
previous
day
i
can
not
escape
thinking
of
it
he
said
but
i
may
avoid
speaking
of
this
seemed
to
me
to
be
the
misplaced
confidence
of
a
weak
man
in
the
refuge
of
silence
by
way
of
changing
the
subject
i
spoke
of
the
child
there
would
be
serious
difficulties
to
contend
with
as
i
ventured
to
suggest
if
he
remained
in
the
town
and
allowed
his
new
responsibilities
to
become
the
subject
of
public
talk
his
reply
to
this
agreeably
surprised
me
there
were
no
difficulties
to
be
feared
the
state
of
his
wife
s
health
had
obliged
him
acting
under
medical
advice
to
try
the
influence
of
her
native
air
an
interval
of
some
months
might
elapse
before
the
good
effect
of
the
change
had
sufficiently
declared
itself
and
a
return
to
the
peculiar
climate
of
the
town
might
bring
on
a
relapse
there
had
consequently
been
no
alternative
to
but
resign
his
charge
only
on
that
day
the
resignation
had
been
accepted
with
expressions
of
regret
sincerely
reciprocated
by
himself
he
proposed
to
leave
the
town
immediately
and
one
of
the
objects
of
his
visit
was
to
bid
me
the
next
place
i
live
in
he
said
will
be
more
than
a
hundred
miles
away
at
that
distance
i
may
hope
to
keep
events
concealed
which
must
be
known
only
to
ourselves
so
far
as
i
can
see
there
are
no
risks
of
discovery
lurking
in
this
place
my
servants
only
two
in
number
have
both
been
born
here
and
have
both
told
my
wife
that
they
have
no
wish
to
go
away
as
to
the
person
who
introduced
herself
to
me
by
the
name
of
miss
chance
she
was
traced
to
the
railway
station
yesterday
afternoon
and
took
her
ticket
for
i
congratulated
the
minister
on
the
good
fortune
which
had
befriended
him
so
far
you
will
understand
how
carefully
i
have
provided
against
being
deceived
he
continued
when
i
tell
you
what
my
plans
are
the
persons
among
whom
my
future
lot
is
cast
and
the
child
herself
of
course
must
never
suspect
that
the
new
member
of
my
family
is
other
than
my
own
daughter
this
is
deceit
i
admit
but
it
is
deceit
that
injures
no
one
i
hope
you
see
the
necessity
for
it
as
i
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
the
necessity
if
the
child
was
described
as
adopted
there
would
be
curiosity
about
the
circumstances
and
inquiries
relating
to
the
parents
prevaricating
replies
lead
to
suspicion
and
suspicion
to
discovery
but
for
the
wise
course
which
the
minister
had
decided
on
taking
the
poor
child
s
life
might
have
been
darkened
by
the
horror
of
the
mother
s
crime
and
the
infamy
of
the
mother
s
death
having
quieted
my
friend
s
needless
scruples
by
this
perfectly
sincere
expression
of
opinion
i
ventured
to
approach
the
central
figure
in
his
domestic
circle
by
means
of
a
question
relating
to
his
wife
how
had
that
lady
received
the
unfortunate
little
creature
for
whose
appearance
on
the
she
must
have
been
entirely
unprepared
the
minister
s
manner
showed
some
embarrassment
he
prefaced
what
he
had
to
tell
me
with
praises
of
his
wife
equally
creditable
no
doubt
to
both
of
them
the
beauty
of
the
child
the
pretty
ways
of
the
child
he
said
fascinated
the
admirable
woman
at
first
sight
it
was
not
to
be
denied
that
she
had
felt
and
had
expressed
misgivings
on
being
informed
of
the
circumstances
under
which
the
minister
s
act
of
mercy
had
been
performed
but
her
mind
was
too
well
balanced
to
incline
to
this
state
of
feeling
when
her
husband
had
addressed
her
in
defense
of
his
conduct
she
then
understood
that
the
true
merit
of
a
good
action
consisted
in
patiently
facing
the
sacrifices
involved
her
interest
in
the
new
daughter
being
in
this
way
ennobled
by
a
sense
of
christian
duty
there
had
been
no
further
difference
of
opinion
between
the
married
pair
i
listened
to
this
plausible
explanation
with
interest
but
at
the
same
time
with
doubts
of
the
lasting
nature
of
the
lady
s
submission
to
circumstances
suggested
perhaps
by
the
constraint
in
the
minister
s
manner
it
was
well
for
both
of
us
when
we
changed
the
subject
he
reminded
me
of
the
discouraging
view
which
the
doctor
had
taken
of
the
prospect
before
him
i
will
not
attempt
to
decide
whether
your
friend
is
right
or
wrong
he
said
trusting
as
i
do
in
the
mercy
of
god
i
look
hopefully
to
a
future
time
when
all
that
is
brightest
and
best
in
the
nature
of
my
adopted
child
will
be
developed
under
my
fostering
care
if
evil
tendencies
show
themselves
my
reliance
will
be
confidently
placed
on
pious
example
on
religious
instruction
and
above
all
on
intercession
by
prayer
repeat
to
your
friend
he
concluded
what
you
have
just
heard
me
say
let
him
ask
himself
if
he
could
confront
the
uncertain
future
with
my
cheerful
submission
and
my
steadfast
he
intrusted
me
with
that
message
and
gave
me
his
hand
so
we
parted
i
agreed
with
him
i
admired
him
but
my
faith
seemed
to
want
sustaining
power
as
compared
with
his
faith
on
his
own
showing
as
it
appeared
to
me
there
would
be
two
forces
in
a
state
of
conflict
in
the
child
s
nature
as
she
grew
up
inherited
evil
against
inculcated
good
try
as
i
might
i
failed
to
feel
the
minister
s
comforting
conviction
as
to
which
of
the
two
would
win
chapter
ix
the
governor
receives
a
visit
a
few
days
after
the
good
man
had
left
us
i
met
with
a
serious
accident
caused
by
a
false
step
on
the
stone
stairs
of
the
prison
the
long
illness
which
followed
this
misfortune
and
my
removal
afterward
in
the
interests
of
my
recovery
to
a
milder
climate
than
the
climate
of
england
obliged
me
to
confide
the
duties
of
governor
of
the
prison
to
a
representative
i
was
absent
from
my
post
for
rather
more
than
a
year
during
this
interval
no
news
reached
me
from
my
reverend
friend
having
returned
to
the
duties
of
my
office
i
thought
of
writing
to
the
minister
while
the
proposed
letter
was
still
in
contemplation
i
was
informed
that
a
lady
wished
to
see
me
she
sent
in
her
card
my
visitor
proved
to
be
the
minister
s
wife
i
observed
her
with
no
ordinary
attention
when
she
entered
the
room
her
dress
was
simple
her
scanty
light
hair
so
far
as
i
could
see
it
under
her
bonnet
was
dressed
with
taste
the
paleness
of
her
lips
and
the
faded
color
in
her
face
suggested
that
she
was
certainly
not
in
good
health
two
peculiarities
struck
me
in
her
personal
appearance
i
never
remembered
having
seen
any
other
person
with
such
a
singularly
narrow
and
slanting
forehead
as
this
lady
presented
and
i
was
impressed
not
at
all
agreeably
by
the
flashing
shifting
expression
in
her
eyes
on
the
other
hand
let
me
own
that
i
was
powerfully
attracted
and
interested
by
the
beauty
of
her
voice
its
fine
variety
of
compass
and
its
musical
resonance
of
tone
fell
with
such
enchantment
on
the
ear
that
i
should
have
liked
to
put
a
book
of
poetry
into
her
hand
and
to
have
heard
her
read
it
in
accompanied
by
the
music
of
a
rocky
stream
the
object
of
her
visit
so
far
as
she
explained
it
at
the
outset
appeared
to
be
to
offer
her
congratulations
on
my
recovery
and
to
tell
me
that
her
husband
had
assumed
the
charge
of
a
church
in
a
large
town
not
far
from
her
birthplace
even
those
commonplace
words
were
made
interesting
by
her
delicious
voice
but
however
sensitive
to
sweet
sounds
a
man
may
be
there
are
limits
to
his
capacity
for
deceiving
himself
especially
when
he
happens
to
be
enlightened
by
experience
of
humanity
within
the
walls
of
a
prison
i
had
it
may
be
remembered
already
doubted
the
lady
s
good
temper
judging
from
her
husband
s
description
of
her
virtues
her
eyes
looked
at
me
furtively
and
her
manner
gracefully
as
it
was
suggested
that
she
had
something
of
a
delicate
or
disagreeable
nature
to
say
to
me
and
that
she
was
at
a
loss
how
to
approach
the
subject
so
as
to
produce
the
right
impression
on
my
mind
at
the
outset
there
was
a
momentary
silence
between
us
for
the
sake
of
saying
something
i
asked
how
she
and
the
minister
liked
their
new
place
of
residence
our
new
place
of
residence
she
answered
has
been
made
interesting
by
a
very
unexpected
event
an
event
how
shall
i
describe
it
which
has
increased
our
happiness
and
enlarged
our
family
there
she
stopped
expecting
me
as
i
fancied
to
guess
what
she
meant
a
woman
and
that
woman
a
mother
might
have
fulfilled
her
anticipations
a
man
and
that
man
not
listening
attentively
was
simply
puzzled
pray
excuse
my
stupidity
i
said
i
don
t
quite
understand
the
lady
s
temper
looked
at
me
out
of
the
lady
s
shifting
eyes
and
hid
itself
again
in
a
moment
she
set
herself
right
in
my
estimation
by
taking
the
whole
blame
of
our
little
misunderstanding
on
her
own
innocent
shoulders
i
ought
to
have
spoken
more
plainly
she
said
let
me
try
what
i
can
do
now
after
many
years
of
disappointment
in
my
married
life
it
has
pleased
providence
to
bestow
on
me
the
happiness
the
inexpressible
happiness
of
being
a
mother
my
baby
is
a
sweet
little
girl
and
my
one
regret
is
that
i
can
not
nurse
her
my
languid
interest
in
the
minister
s
wife
was
not
stimulated
by
the
announcement
of
this
domestic
event
i
felt
no
wish
to
see
the
sweet
little
girl
i
was
not
even
reminded
of
another
example
of
maternity
which
had
occurred
within
the
limits
of
my
own
family
circle
all
my
sympathies
attached
themselves
to
the
sad
little
figure
of
the
adopted
child
i
remembered
the
poor
baby
on
my
knee
enchanted
by
the
ticking
of
my
watch
i
thought
of
her
peacefully
and
prettily
asleep
under
the
horrid
shelter
of
the
condemned
cell
and
it
is
hardly
too
much
to
say
that
my
heart
was
heavy
when
i
compared
her
prospects
with
the
prospects
of
her
kind
as
he
was
conscientious
as
he
was
could
the
minister
be
expected
to
admit
to
an
equal
share
in
his
love
the
child
endeared
to
him
as
a
father
and
the
child
who
merely
reminded
him
of
an
act
of
mercy
as
for
his
wife
it
seemed
the
merest
waste
of
time
to
put
her
state
of
feeling
placed
between
the
two
children
to
the
test
of
inquiry
i
tried
the
useless
experiment
nevertheless
it
is
pleasant
to
think
i
began
that
your
other
daughter
she
interrupted
me
with
the
utmost
gentleness
do
you
mean
the
child
that
my
husband
was
foolish
enough
to
adopt
say
rather
fortunate
enough
to
adopt
i
persisted
as
your
own
little
girl
grows
up
she
will
want
a
playfellow
and
she
will
find
a
playfellow
in
that
other
child
whom
the
good
minister
has
taken
for
his
no
my
dear
sir
not
if
i
can
prevent
the
contrast
between
the
cruelty
of
her
intention
and
the
musical
beauty
of
the
voice
which
politely
expressed
it
in
those
words
really
startled
me
i
was
at
a
loss
how
to
answer
her
at
the
very
time
when
i
ought
to
have
been
most
ready
to
speak
you
must
surely
understand
she
went
on
that
we
don
t
want
another
person
s
child
now
we
have
a
little
darling
of
our
own
does
your
husband
agree
with
you
in
that
view
i
asked
oh
dear
no
he
said
what
you
said
just
now
and
oddly
enough
almost
in
the
same
words
but
i
don
t
at
all
despair
of
persuading
him
to
change
his
mind
and
you
can
help
she
made
that
audacious
assertion
with
such
an
appearance
of
feeling
perfectly
sure
of
me
that
my
politeness
gave
way
under
the
strain
laid
on
it
what
do
you
mean
i
asked
sharply
not
in
the
least
impressed
by
my
change
of
manner
she
took
from
the
pocket
of
her
dress
a
printed
paper
you
will
find
what
i
mean
there
she
replied
and
put
the
paper
into
my
hand
it
was
an
appeal
to
the
charitable
public
occasioned
by
the
enlargement
of
an
with
which
i
had
been
connected
for
many
years
what
she
meant
was
plain
enough
now
i
said
nothing
i
only
looked
at
her
pleased
to
find
that
i
was
clever
enough
to
guess
what
she
meant
on
this
occasion
the
minister
s
wife
informed
me
that
the
circumstances
were
all
in
our
favor
she
still
persisted
in
taking
me
into
partnership
the
circumstances
were
in
favor
in
two
years
more
she
explained
the
child
of
that
detestable
creature
who
was
hanged
do
you
know
i
can
not
even
look
at
the
little
wretch
without
thinking
of
the
gallows
will
be
old
enough
with
your
interest
to
help
us
to
be
received
into
the
asylum
what
a
relief
it
will
be
to
get
rid
of
that
child
and
how
hard
i
shall
work
at
canvassing
for
subscribers
votes
your
name
will
be
a
tower
of
strength
when
i
use
it
as
a
reference
pardon
me
you
are
not
looking
so
pleasantly
as
usual
do
you
see
some
obstacles
in
our
way
i
see
two
what
can
they
possibly
be
for
the
second
time
my
politeness
gave
way
under
the
strain
laid
on
it
you
know
perfectly
well
i
said
what
one
of
the
obstacles
am
i
to
understand
that
you
contemplate
any
serious
resistance
on
the
part
of
my
husband
certainly
she
was
unaffectedly
amused
by
my
simplicity
are
you
a
single
man
she
asked
i
am
a
then
your
experience
ought
to
tell
you
that
i
know
every
weak
point
in
the
minister
s
character
i
can
tell
him
on
your
authority
that
the
hateful
child
will
be
placed
in
competent
and
kindly
hands
and
i
have
my
own
sweet
baby
to
plead
for
me
with
these
advantages
in
my
favor
do
you
actually
suppose
i
can
fail
to
make
way
of
thinking
way
of
thinking
you
must
have
forgotten
your
own
married
life
suppose
we
go
on
to
the
second
of
your
two
obstacles
i
hope
it
will
be
better
worth
considering
than
the
the
second
obstacle
will
not
disappoint
you
i
answered
i
am
the
obstacle
this
you
refuse
to
help
me
perhaps
reflection
may
alter
your
resolution
reflection
will
do
nothing
of
the
you
are
rude
sir
in
speaking
to
you
madam
i
have
no
alternative
but
to
speak
she
rose
her
shifting
eyes
for
once
looked
at
me
steadily
what
sort
of
enemy
have
i
made
of
you
she
asked
a
passive
enemy
who
is
content
with
refusing
to
help
me
or
an
active
enemy
who
will
write
to
my
husband
it
depends
entirely
i
told
her
on
what
your
husband
does
if
he
questions
me
about
you
i
shall
tell
him
the
and
if
not
in
that
case
i
shall
hope
to
forget
that
you
ever
favored
me
with
a
in
making
this
reply
i
was
guiltless
of
any
malicious
intention
what
evil
interpretation
she
placed
on
my
words
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
say
i
can
only
declare
that
some
intolerable
sense
of
injury
hurried
her
into
an
outbreak
of
rage
her
voice
strained
for
the
first
time
lost
its
tuneful
beauty
of
tone
come
and
see
us
in
two
years
time
she
burst
out
and
discover
the
orphan
of
the
gallows
in
our
house
if
you
can
if
your
asylum
won
t
take
her
some
other
charity
will
ha
mr
governor
i
deserve
my
disappointment
i
ought
to
have
remembered
that
you
are
only
a
jailer
after
all
and
what
is
a
jailer
proverbially
a
brute
do
you
hear
that
a
brute
her
strength
suddenly
failed
her
she
dropped
back
into
the
chair
from
which
she
had
risen
with
a
faint
cry
of
pain
a
ghastly
pallor
stole
over
her
face
there
was
wine
on
the
sideboard
i
filled
a
glass
she
refused
to
take
it
at
that
time
in
the
day
the
doctor
s
duties
required
his
attendance
in
the
prison
i
instantly
sent
for
him
after
a
moment
s
look
at
her
he
took
the
wine
out
of
my
hand
and
held
the
glass
to
her
lips
drink
it
he
said
she
still
refused
drink
it
he
reiterated
or
you
will
that
frightened
her
she
drank
the
wine
the
doctor
waited
for
a
while
with
his
fingers
on
her
pulse
she
will
do
now
he
said
can
i
go
she
asked
go
wherever
you
please
madam
so
long
as
you
don
t
go
upstairs
in
a
she
smiled
i
understand
you
sir
and
thank
you
for
your
i
asked
the
doctor
when
we
were
alone
what
made
him
tell
her
not
to
go
upstairs
in
a
hurry
what
i
felt
he
answered
when
i
had
my
fingers
on
her
pulse
you
heard
her
say
that
she
understood
yes
but
i
don
t
know
what
she
she
meant
probably
that
her
own
doctor
had
warned
her
as
i
something
seriously
wrong
with
her
health
what
is
it
chapter
x
miss
chance
reappears
a
week
had
passed
since
the
minister
s
wife
had
left
me
when
i
received
a
letter
from
the
minister
himself
after
surprising
me
as
he
innocently
supposed
by
announcing
the
birth
of
his
child
he
mentioned
some
circumstances
connected
with
that
event
which
i
now
heard
for
the
first
time
within
an
easy
journey
of
the
populous
scene
of
my
present
labors
he
wrote
there
is
a
secluded
country
village
called
low
lanes
the
rector
of
the
place
is
my
wife
s
brother
before
the
birth
of
our
infant
he
had
asked
his
sister
to
stay
for
a
while
at
his
house
and
the
doctor
thought
she
might
safely
be
allowed
to
accept
the
invitation
through
some
error
in
the
customary
calculations
as
i
suppose
the
child
was
born
unexpectedly
at
the
rectory
and
the
ceremony
of
baptism
was
performed
at
the
church
under
circumstances
which
i
am
not
able
to
relate
within
the
limits
of
a
letter
let
me
only
say
that
i
allude
to
this
incident
without
any
sectarian
bitterness
of
feeling
for
i
am
no
enemy
to
the
church
of
england
you
have
no
idea
what
treasures
of
virtue
and
treasures
of
beauty
maternity
has
revealed
in
my
wife
s
sweet
nature
other
mothers
in
her
proud
position
might
find
their
love
cooling
toward
the
poor
child
whom
we
have
adopted
but
my
household
is
irradiated
by
the
presence
of
an
angel
who
gives
an
equal
share
in
her
affections
to
the
two
little
ones
in
this
style
of
writing
the
poor
man
unconsciously
told
me
how
cunningly
and
how
cruelly
his
wife
was
deceiving
him
i
longed
to
exhibit
that
wicked
woman
in
her
true
character
but
what
could
i
do
she
must
have
been
so
favored
by
circumstances
as
to
be
able
to
account
for
her
absence
from
home
without
exciting
the
slightest
suspicion
of
the
journey
which
she
had
really
taken
if
i
declared
in
my
reply
to
the
minister
s
letter
that
i
had
received
her
in
my
rooms
and
if
i
repeated
the
conversation
that
had
taken
place
what
would
the
result
be
she
would
find
an
easy
refuge
in
positive
denial
of
the
truth
and
in
that
case
which
of
us
would
her
infatuated
husband
believe
the
one
part
of
the
letter
which
i
read
with
some
satisfaction
was
the
end
of
it
i
was
here
informed
that
the
minister
s
plans
for
concealing
the
parentage
of
his
adopted
daughter
had
proved
to
be
entirely
successful
the
members
of
the
new
domestic
household
believed
the
two
children
to
be
neither
was
there
any
danger
of
the
adopted
child
being
identified
as
the
oldest
child
of
the
two
by
consultation
of
the
registers
before
he
left
our
town
the
minister
had
seen
for
himself
that
no
baptismal
name
had
been
added
after
the
birth
of
the
daughter
of
the
murderess
had
been
registered
and
that
no
entry
of
baptism
existed
in
the
registers
kept
in
places
of
worship
he
drew
the
inference
in
all
probability
a
true
inference
considering
the
characters
of
the
parents
that
the
child
had
never
been
baptized
and
he
performed
the
ceremony
privately
abstaining
for
obvious
reasons
from
adding
her
christian
name
to
the
imperfect
register
of
her
birth
i
am
not
aware
he
wrote
whether
i
have
or
have
not
committed
an
offense
against
the
law
in
any
case
i
may
hope
to
have
made
atonement
by
obedience
to
the
six
weeks
passed
and
i
heard
from
my
reverend
friend
once
more
his
second
letter
presented
a
marked
contrast
to
the
first
it
was
written
in
sorrow
and
anxiety
to
inform
me
of
an
alarming
change
for
the
worse
in
his
wife
s
health
i
showed
the
letter
to
my
medical
colleague
after
reading
it
he
predicted
the
event
that
might
be
expected
in
two
words
sudden
death
on
the
next
occasion
when
i
heard
from
the
minister
the
doctor
s
grim
reply
proved
to
be
a
prophecy
fulfilled
when
we
address
expressions
of
condolence
to
bereaved
friends
the
principles
of
popular
hypocrisy
sanction
indiscriminate
lying
as
a
duty
which
we
owe
to
the
dead
no
matter
what
their
lives
may
have
been
because
they
are
dead
within
my
own
little
sphere
i
have
always
been
silent
when
i
could
not
offer
to
afflicted
persons
expressions
of
sympathy
which
i
honestly
felt
to
have
condoled
with
the
minister
on
the
loss
that
he
had
sustained
by
the
death
of
a
woman
to
me
as
shamelessly
deceitful
and
pitilessly
determined
to
reach
her
own
cruel
ends
would
have
been
to
degrade
myself
by
telling
a
deliberate
lie
i
expressed
in
my
answer
all
that
an
honest
man
naturally
feels
when
he
is
writing
to
a
friend
in
distress
carefully
abstaining
from
any
allusion
to
the
memory
of
his
wife
or
to
the
place
which
her
death
had
left
vacant
in
his
household
my
letter
i
am
sorry
to
say
disappointed
and
offended
him
he
wrote
to
me
no
more
until
years
had
passed
and
time
had
exerted
its
influence
in
producing
a
more
indulgent
frame
of
mind
these
letters
of
a
later
date
have
been
preserved
and
will
probably
be
used
at
the
right
time
for
purposes
of
explanation
with
which
i
may
be
connected
in
the
future
the
correspondent
whom
i
had
now
lost
was
succeeded
by
a
gentleman
entirely
unknown
to
me
those
reasons
which
induced
me
to
conceal
the
names
of
persons
while
i
was
relating
events
in
the
prison
do
not
apply
to
correspondence
with
a
stranger
writing
from
another
place
i
may
therefore
mention
that
dunboyne
of
fairmount
on
the
west
coast
of
ireland
was
the
writer
of
the
letter
now
addressed
to
me
he
proved
to
my
surprise
to
be
one
of
the
relations
whom
the
prisoner
under
sentence
of
death
had
not
cared
to
see
when
i
offered
her
the
opportunity
of
saying
farewell
dunboyne
was
a
of
the
murderess
he
had
married
her
sister
his
wife
he
informed
me
had
died
in
childbirth
leaving
him
but
one
consolation
a
boy
who
already
recalled
all
that
was
brightest
and
best
in
his
lost
mother
the
father
was
naturally
anxious
that
the
son
should
never
become
acquainted
with
the
disgrace
that
had
befallen
the
family
the
letter
then
proceeded
in
these
terms
i
heard
yesterday
for
the
first
time
by
means
of
an
old
sent
to
me
by
a
friend
that
the
miserable
woman
who
suffered
the
ignominy
of
public
execution
has
left
an
infant
child
can
you
tell
me
what
has
become
of
the
orphan
if
this
little
girl
is
as
i
fear
not
well
provided
for
i
only
do
what
my
wife
would
have
done
if
she
had
lived
by
offering
to
make
the
child
s
welfare
my
especial
care
i
am
willing
to
place
her
in
an
establishment
well
known
to
me
in
which
she
will
be
kindly
treated
well
educated
and
fitted
to
earn
her
own
living
honorably
in
later
life
if
you
feel
some
surprise
at
finding
that
my
good
intentions
toward
this
niece
of
mine
do
not
go
to
the
length
of
receiving
her
as
a
member
of
my
own
family
i
beg
to
submit
some
considerations
which
may
perhaps
weigh
with
you
as
they
have
weighed
with
me
in
the
first
place
there
is
at
least
a
possibility
however
carefully
i
might
try
to
conceal
it
that
the
child
s
parentage
would
sooner
or
later
be
discovered
in
the
second
place
and
assuming
that
the
parentage
had
been
successfully
concealed
if
this
girl
and
my
boy
grew
up
together
there
is
another
possibility
to
be
reckoned
with
they
might
become
attached
to
each
other
does
the
father
live
who
would
allow
his
son
ignorantly
to
marry
the
daughter
of
a
convicted
murderess
i
should
have
no
alternative
but
to
part
them
cruelly
by
revealing
the
the
letter
ended
with
some
complimentary
expressions
addressed
to
myself
and
the
question
was
how
ought
i
to
answer
it
my
correspondent
had
strongly
impressed
me
in
his
favor
i
could
not
doubt
that
he
was
an
honorable
man
but
the
interest
of
the
minister
in
keeping
his
own
benevolent
action
secure
from
the
risk
of
discovery
increased
as
that
interest
was
by
the
filial
relations
of
the
two
children
toward
him
now
publicly
established
had
as
i
could
not
doubt
the
paramount
claim
on
me
the
absolutely
safe
course
to
take
was
to
admit
no
one
friend
or
stranger
to
our
confidence
i
replied
expressing
sincere
admiration
of
dunboyne
s
motives
and
merely
informing
him
that
the
child
was
already
provided
for
after
that
i
heard
no
more
of
the
irish
gentleman
it
is
perhaps
hardly
necessary
to
add
that
i
kept
the
minister
in
ignorance
of
my
correspondence
with
dunboyne
i
was
too
well
acquainted
with
my
friend
s
sensitive
and
nature
to
let
him
know
that
a
relative
of
the
murderess
was
living
and
was
aware
that
she
had
left
a
child
a
last
event
remains
to
be
related
before
i
close
these
pages
during
the
year
of
which
i
am
now
writing
our
chaplain
added
one
more
to
the
many
examples
that
i
have
seen
of
his
generous
readiness
to
serve
his
friends
he
had
arranged
to
devote
his
annual
leave
of
absence
to
a
tour
among
the
english
lakes
when
he
received
a
letter
from
a
clergyman
resident
in
london
whom
he
had
known
from
the
time
when
they
had
been
this
old
friend
wrote
under
circumstances
of
the
severest
domestic
distress
which
made
it
absolutely
necessary
that
he
should
leave
london
for
a
while
having
failed
to
find
a
representative
who
could
relieve
him
of
his
clerical
duties
he
applied
to
the
chaplain
to
recommend
a
clergyman
who
might
be
in
a
position
to
help
him
my
excellent
colleague
gave
up
his
without
hesitation
and
went
to
london
himself
on
his
return
i
asked
if
he
had
seen
anything
of
some
acquaintances
of
his
and
of
mine
who
were
then
visitors
to
the
metropolis
he
smiled
significantly
when
he
answered
me
i
have
a
card
to
deliver
from
an
acquaintance
whom
you
have
not
mentioned
he
said
and
i
rather
think
it
will
astonish
it
simply
puzzled
me
when
he
gave
me
the
card
this
is
what
i
found
printed
on
it
mrs
tenbruggen
of
south
beveland
well
said
the
chaplain
well
i
answered
i
never
even
heard
of
tenbruggen
of
south
beveland
who
is
she
i
married
the
lady
to
a
foreign
gentleman
only
last
week
at
my
friend
s
church
the
chaplain
replied
perhaps
you
may
remember
her
maiden
name
he
mentioned
the
name
of
the
dangerous
creature
who
had
first
presented
herself
to
me
in
charge
of
the
prisoner
s
child
otherwise
miss
elizabeth
chance
the
reappearance
of
this
woman
on
the
scene
although
she
was
only
represented
by
her
card
caused
me
a
feeling
of
vague
uneasiness
so
contemptibly
superstitious
in
its
nature
that
i
now
remember
it
with
shame
i
asked
a
stupid
question
how
did
it
happen
in
the
ordinary
course
of
such
things
my
friend
said
they
were
married
by
license
in
their
parish
church
the
bridegroom
was
a
fine
tall
man
with
a
bold
eye
and
a
dashing
manner
the
bride
and
i
recognized
each
other
directly
when
miss
chance
had
become
tenbruggen
she
took
me
aside
and
gave
me
her
card
ask
the
governor
to
accept
it
she
said
in
remembrance
of
the
time
when
he
took
me
for
a
nursemaid
tell
him
i
am
married
to
a
dutch
gentleman
of
high
family
if
he
ever
comes
to
holland
we
shall
be
glad
to
see
him
in
our
residence
at
south
there
is
her
message
to
you
repeated
word
for
i
am
glad
she
is
going
to
live
out
of
why
surely
you
have
no
reason
to
fear
her
none
you
are
thinking
perhaps
of
somebody
else
i
was
thinking
of
the
minister
but
it
seemed
to
be
safest
not
to
say
so
my
pen
is
laid
aside
and
my
many
pages
of
writing
have
been
sent
to
their
destination
what
i
undertook
to
do
is
now
done
to
take
a
metaphor
from
the
stage
the
curtain
falls
here
on
the
governor
and
the
prison
second
period
the
girls
and
the
journals
chapter
xi
helena
s
diary
we
both
said
and
went
up
to
our
room
with
a
new
object
in
view
by
our
father
s
advice
we
had
resolved
on
keeping
diaries
for
the
first
time
in
our
lives
and
had
pledged
ourselves
to
begin
before
we
went
to
bed
slowly
and
silently
and
lazily
my
sister
sauntered
to
her
end
of
the
room
and
seated
herself
at
her
on
the
desk
lay
a
nicely
bound
book
full
of
blank
pages
the
word
journal
was
printed
on
it
in
gold
letters
and
there
was
fitted
to
the
covers
a
bright
brass
lock
and
key
a
second
journal
exactly
similar
in
every
respect
to
the
first
was
placed
on
the
at
my
end
of
the
room
i
opened
my
book
the
sight
of
the
blank
leaves
irritated
me
they
were
so
smooth
so
spotless
so
entirely
ready
to
do
duty
i
took
too
deep
a
dip
of
ink
and
began
the
first
entry
in
my
diary
by
making
a
blot
this
was
discouraging
i
got
up
and
looked
out
of
window
helena
my
sister
s
voice
could
hardly
have
addressed
me
in
a
more
weary
tone
if
her
pen
had
been
at
work
all
night
relating
domestic
events
well
i
said
what
is
it
have
you
done
already
she
asked
i
showed
her
the
blot
my
sister
eunice
the
strangest
as
well
as
the
dearest
of
girls
always
blurts
out
what
she
has
in
her
mind
at
the
time
she
fixed
her
eyes
gravely
on
my
spoiled
page
and
said
that
comforts
i
crossed
the
room
and
looked
at
her
book
she
had
not
even
summoned
energy
enough
to
make
a
blot
what
will
papa
think
of
us
she
said
if
we
don
t
begin
why
not
begin
i
suggested
by
writing
down
what
he
said
when
he
gave
us
our
journals
those
wise
words
of
advice
will
be
in
their
proper
place
on
the
first
page
of
the
new
not
at
all
a
demonstrative
girl
naturally
not
ready
with
her
tears
not
liberal
with
her
caresses
not
fluent
in
her
talk
eunice
was
affected
by
my
proposal
in
a
manner
wonderful
to
see
she
suddenly
developed
into
an
excitable
person
i
declare
she
kissed
me
oh
she
burst
out
how
clever
you
are
the
very
thing
to
write
about
i
ll
do
it
she
really
did
it
directly
without
once
stopping
to
consider
without
once
waiting
to
ask
my
advice
line
after
line
i
heard
her
noisy
pen
hurrying
to
the
bottom
of
a
first
page
and
getting
of
the
way
toward
the
end
of
a
second
page
before
she
closed
her
diary
i
reminded
her
that
she
had
not
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
which
was
intended
to
keep
her
writing
private
it
s
not
worth
while
she
answered
anybody
who
cares
to
do
it
may
read
what
i
write
the
singular
change
which
i
had
noticed
in
her
began
to
disappear
when
she
set
about
her
preparations
for
bed
i
noticed
the
old
easy
indolent
movements
again
and
that
regular
and
deliberate
method
of
brushing
her
hair
which
i
can
never
contemplate
without
feeling
a
stupefying
influence
that
has
helped
me
to
many
a
delicious
night
s
sleep
she
said
her
prayers
in
her
favorite
corner
of
the
room
and
laid
her
head
on
the
pillow
with
the
luxurious
little
sigh
which
announces
that
she
is
falling
asleep
this
reappearance
of
her
usual
habits
was
really
a
relief
to
me
eunice
in
a
state
of
excitement
is
eunice
exhibiting
an
unnatural
spectacle
the
next
thing
i
did
was
to
take
the
liberty
which
she
had
already
sanctioned
i
mean
the
liberty
of
reading
what
she
had
written
here
it
is
copied
exactly
i
am
not
half
so
fond
of
anybody
as
i
am
of
papa
he
is
always
kind
he
is
always
right
i
love
him
i
love
him
i
love
him
but
this
is
not
how
i
meant
to
begin
i
must
tell
how
he
talked
to
us
i
wish
he
was
here
to
tell
it
himself
he
said
to
me
you
are
getting
lazier
than
ever
he
said
to
helena
you
are
feeling
the
influence
of
eunice
s
he
said
to
both
of
us
you
are
too
ready
my
dear
children
to
sit
with
your
hands
on
your
laps
looking
at
nothing
and
thinking
of
nothing
i
want
to
try
a
new
way
of
employing
your
leisure
he
opened
a
parcel
on
the
table
he
made
each
of
us
a
present
of
a
beautiful
book
called
he
said
when
you
have
nothing
to
do
my
dears
in
the
evening
employ
yourselves
in
keeping
a
diary
of
the
events
of
the
day
it
will
be
a
useful
record
in
many
ways
and
a
good
moral
discipline
for
young
helena
said
oh
thank
you
i
said
the
same
but
not
so
cheerfully
the
truth
is
i
feel
out
of
spirits
now
if
i
think
of
papa
i
am
not
easy
in
my
mind
about
him
when
he
is
very
much
interested
there
is
a
quivering
in
his
face
which
i
don
t
remember
in
past
times
he
seems
to
have
got
older
and
thinner
all
on
a
sudden
he
shouts
which
he
never
used
to
do
when
he
threatens
sinners
at
being
in
dreadful
earnest
about
our
souls
he
is
of
course
obliged
to
speak
of
the
devil
but
he
never
used
to
hit
the
harmless
pulpit
cushion
with
his
fist
as
he
does
now
nobody
seems
to
have
seen
these
things
but
me
and
now
i
have
noticed
them
what
ought
i
to
do
i
don
t
know
i
am
certain
of
nothing
except
what
i
have
put
in
at
the
top
of
page
one
i
love
him
i
love
him
i
love
there
this
very
curious
entry
ended
it
was
easy
enough
to
discover
the
influence
which
had
made
my
sister
so
ready
with
her
memory
and
her
pen
so
ready
in
short
to
do
anything
and
everything
provided
her
heart
was
in
it
and
her
father
was
in
it
but
eunice
is
wrong
let
me
tell
her
in
what
she
says
of
myself
i
too
have
seen
the
sad
change
in
my
father
but
i
happen
to
know
that
he
dislikes
having
it
spoken
of
at
home
and
i
have
kept
my
painful
discoveries
to
myself
unhappily
the
best
medical
advice
is
beyond
our
reach
the
one
really
competent
doctor
in
this
place
is
known
to
be
an
infidel
but
for
that
shocking
obstacle
i
might
have
persuaded
my
father
to
see
him
as
for
the
other
two
doctors
whom
he
has
consulted
at
different
times
one
talked
about
suppressed
gout
and
the
other
told
him
to
take
a
year
s
holiday
and
enjoy
himself
on
the
continent
the
clock
has
just
struck
twelve
i
have
been
writing
and
copying
till
my
eyes
are
heavy
and
i
want
to
follow
eunice
s
example
and
sleep
as
soundly
as
she
does
we
have
made
a
strange
beginning
of
this
journalizing
experiment
i
wonder
how
long
it
will
go
on
and
what
will
come
of
it
second
day
i
begin
to
be
afraid
that
i
am
as
stupid
no
that
is
not
a
nice
word
to
use
let
me
say
as
simple
as
dear
eunice
a
diary
means
a
record
of
the
events
of
the
day
and
not
one
of
the
events
of
yesterday
appears
in
my
sister
s
journal
or
in
mine
well
it
is
easy
to
set
that
mistake
right
our
lives
are
so
dull
but
i
would
not
say
so
in
my
father
s
hearing
for
the
world
that
the
record
of
one
day
will
be
much
the
same
as
the
record
of
another
after
family
prayers
and
breakfast
i
suffer
my
customary
persecution
at
the
hands
of
the
cook
that
is
to
say
i
am
obliged
being
the
housekeeper
to
order
what
we
have
to
eat
oh
how
i
hate
inventing
dinners
and
how
i
admire
the
enviable
slowness
of
mind
and
laziness
of
body
which
have
saved
eunice
from
undertaking
the
worries
of
housekeeping
in
her
turn
she
can
go
and
work
in
her
garden
while
i
am
racking
my
invention
to
discover
variety
in
dishes
without
overstepping
the
limits
of
economy
i
suppose
i
may
confess
it
privately
to
myself
how
sorry
i
am
not
to
have
been
born
a
man
my
next
employment
leads
me
to
my
father
s
study
to
write
under
his
dictation
i
don
t
complain
of
this
it
flatters
my
pride
to
feel
that
i
am
helping
so
great
a
man
at
the
same
time
i
do
notice
that
here
again
eunice
s
little
defects
have
relieved
her
of
another
responsibility
she
can
neither
keep
dictated
words
in
her
memory
nor
has
she
ever
been
able
to
learn
how
to
put
in
her
stops
after
the
dictation
i
have
an
hour
s
time
left
for
practicing
music
my
sister
comes
in
from
the
garden
with
her
pencil
and
and
practices
drawing
then
we
go
out
for
a
walk
a
delightful
walk
if
my
father
goes
too
he
has
something
always
new
to
tell
us
suggested
by
what
we
pass
on
the
way
then
comes
not
always
a
pleasant
part
of
the
day
to
me
sometimes
i
hear
paternal
complaints
always
gentle
complaints
of
my
housekeeping
sometimes
my
sister
i
won
t
say
the
greedy
sister
tells
me
i
have
not
given
her
enough
to
eat
poor
father
dear
eunice
dinner
having
reached
its
end
we
stroll
in
the
garden
when
the
weather
is
fine
when
it
rains
we
make
flannel
petticoats
for
poor
old
women
what
a
horrid
thing
old
age
is
to
look
at
to
be
ugly
to
be
helpless
to
be
miserably
unfit
for
all
the
pleasures
of
life
i
hope
i
shall
not
live
to
be
an
old
woman
what
would
my
father
say
if
he
saw
this
for
his
sake
to
say
nothing
of
my
own
feelings
i
shall
do
well
if
i
make
it
a
custom
to
use
the
lock
of
my
journal
our
next
occupation
is
to
join
the
scripture
class
for
girls
and
to
help
the
teacher
this
is
a
good
discipline
for
eunice
s
temper
and
oh
i
don
t
deny
it
for
my
temper
too
i
may
long
to
box
the
ears
of
the
whole
class
but
it
is
my
duty
to
keep
a
smiling
face
and
to
be
a
model
of
patience
from
the
scripture
class
we
sometimes
go
to
my
father
s
lecture
at
other
times
we
may
amuse
ourselves
as
well
as
we
can
till
the
tea
is
ready
after
tea
we
read
books
which
instruct
us
poetry
and
novels
being
forbidden
when
we
are
tired
of
the
books
we
talk
when
supper
is
over
we
have
prayers
again
and
we
go
to
bed
there
is
our
day
oh
dear
me
there
is
our
day
and
how
has
eunice
succeeded
in
her
second
attempt
at
keeping
a
diary
here
is
what
she
has
written
it
has
one
merit
that
nobody
can
deny
it
is
soon
read
i
hope
papa
will
excuse
me
i
have
nothing
to
write
about
over
and
over
again
i
have
tried
to
point
out
to
my
sister
the
absurdity
of
calling
her
father
by
the
infantile
nickname
of
papa
i
have
reminded
her
that
she
is
in
years
at
least
no
longer
a
child
why
don
t
you
call
him
father
as
i
do
i
asked
only
the
other
day
she
made
an
absurd
reply
i
used
to
call
him
papa
when
i
was
a
little
that
i
reminded
her
doesn
t
justify
you
in
calling
him
papa
and
she
actually
answered
yes
it
what
a
strange
state
of
mind
and
what
a
charming
girl
in
spite
of
her
mind
third
day
the
morning
post
has
brought
with
it
a
promise
of
some
little
variety
in
our
lives
or
to
speak
more
correctly
in
the
life
of
my
sister
our
new
and
nice
friends
the
staveleys
have
written
to
invite
eunice
to
pay
them
a
visit
at
their
house
in
london
i
don
t
complain
at
being
left
at
home
it
would
be
unfilial
indeed
if
we
both
of
us
forsook
our
father
and
last
year
it
was
my
turn
to
receive
the
first
invitation
and
to
enjoy
the
change
of
scene
the
staveleys
are
excellent
people
strictly
pious
members
of
the
methodist
connection
and
exceedingly
kind
to
my
sister
and
me
but
it
was
just
as
well
for
my
moral
welfare
that
i
ended
my
visit
to
our
friends
when
i
did
with
my
fondness
for
music
i
felt
the
temptation
of
the
evil
one
trying
me
when
i
saw
placards
in
the
street
announcing
that
the
italian
opera
was
open
i
had
no
wish
to
be
a
witness
of
the
shameful
and
sinful
dancing
which
goes
on
i
am
told
at
the
opera
but
i
did
feel
my
principles
shaken
when
i
thought
of
the
wonderful
singers
and
the
entrancing
music
and
this
when
i
knew
what
an
atmosphere
of
wickedness
people
breathe
who
enter
a
theater
i
reflect
with
horror
on
what
have
happened
if
i
had
remained
a
little
longer
in
london
helping
eunice
to
pack
up
i
put
her
journal
into
the
box
you
will
find
something
to
write
about
now
i
told
her
while
i
record
everything
that
happens
at
home
you
will
keep
your
diary
of
all
that
you
do
in
london
and
when
you
come
back
we
will
show
each
other
what
we
have
my
sister
is
a
dear
creature
i
don
t
feel
sure
of
being
able
to
do
it
she
answered
but
i
promise
to
good
eunice
chapter
xii
eunice
s
diary
the
air
of
london
feels
very
heavy
there
is
a
nasty
smell
of
smoke
in
london
there
are
too
many
people
in
london
they
seem
to
be
mostly
people
in
a
hurry
the
head
of
a
country
girl
when
she
goes
into
the
streets
turns
giddy
i
suppose
through
not
being
used
to
the
noise
i
do
hope
that
it
is
london
that
has
put
me
out
of
temper
otherwise
it
must
be
i
myself
who
am
i
have
not
yet
been
one
whole
day
in
the
staveleys
house
and
they
have
offended
me
already
i
don
t
want
helena
to
hear
of
this
from
other
people
and
then
to
ask
me
why
i
concealed
it
from
her
we
are
to
read
each
other
s
journals
when
we
are
both
at
home
again
let
her
see
what
i
have
to
say
for
myself
here
there
are
seven
staveleys
in
all
and
two
three
young
masters
five
two
young
misses
seven
an
eldest
miss
and
the
second
young
master
are
the
only
ones
at
home
at
the
present
time
and
miss
kissed
me
when
i
arrived
young
master
only
shook
hands
he
looked
as
if
he
would
have
liked
to
kiss
me
too
why
shouldn
t
he
it
wouldn
t
have
mattered
i
don
t
myself
like
kissing
what
is
the
use
of
it
where
is
the
pleasure
of
it
was
so
glad
to
see
me
she
took
hold
of
me
by
both
hands
she
said
my
dear
child
you
are
improving
you
were
wretchedly
thin
when
i
saw
you
last
now
you
are
almost
as
as
your
sister
i
think
you
are
prettier
than
your
didn
t
agree
to
that
he
and
his
wife
began
to
dispute
about
me
before
my
face
i
do
call
that
an
aggravating
thing
to
endure
said
she
hasn
t
got
her
sister
s
pretty
gray
said
she
has
got
pretty
brown
eyes
which
are
just
as
said
you
can
t
compare
her
complexion
with
helena
said
i
like
eunice
s
pale
complexion
so
young
miss
struck
in
i
admire
helena
s
hair
light
young
master
took
his
turn
i
prefer
eunice
s
hair
dark
opened
his
great
big
mouth
and
asked
a
question
which
of
you
two
sisters
is
the
oldest
i
answered
for
me
helena
is
the
oldest
she
told
us
so
when
she
was
here
i
really
could
stand
that
you
must
be
mistaken
i
burst
out
certainly
not
my
then
helena
was
i
was
unwilling
to
say
of
my
sister
that
she
had
been
deceiving
them
though
it
did
seem
only
too
likely
and
looked
at
each
other
said
you
seem
to
be
very
positive
eunice
surely
helena
ought
to
i
said
helena
knows
a
good
deal
but
she
doesn
t
know
which
of
us
is
the
oldest
of
the
put
in
another
question
do
know
no
more
than
helena
said
don
t
you
keep
birthdays
i
said
yes
we
keep
both
our
birthdays
on
the
same
on
what
day
the
first
day
of
the
new
tried
again
you
can
t
possibly
be
twins
i
don
t
perhaps
helena
knows
not
she
took
the
next
question
out
of
her
husband
s
mouth
come
come
my
dear
you
must
know
how
old
you
yes
i
do
know
that
i
m
and
how
old
is
helena
helena
s
turned
round
to
do
you
hear
that
said
i
shall
write
to
her
father
and
ask
what
it
i
said
papa
will
only
tell
you
what
he
told
us
years
what
did
your
father
say
he
said
he
had
added
our
two
ages
together
and
he
meant
to
divide
the
product
between
us
it
s
so
long
since
i
don
t
remember
what
the
product
was
then
but
i
ll
tell
you
what
the
product
is
now
our
two
ages
come
to
half
is
eighteen
i
get
one
half
and
helena
gets
the
other
when
we
ask
what
it
means
and
when
friends
ask
what
it
means
papa
has
got
the
same
answer
for
everybody
i
have
my
that
s
all
he
says
and
that
s
all
i
i
had
no
intention
of
making
angry
but
he
did
get
angry
he
left
off
speaking
to
me
by
my
christian
name
he
called
me
by
my
surname
he
said
let
me
tell
you
miss
gracedieu
it
is
not
becoming
in
a
young
lady
to
mystify
her
i
had
heard
that
it
was
respectful
in
a
young
lady
to
call
an
old
gentleman
sir
and
to
say
if
you
please
i
took
care
to
be
respectful
now
if
you
please
sir
write
to
papa
you
will
find
that
i
have
spoken
the
a
woman
opened
the
door
and
said
to
staveley
dinner
ma
that
stopped
this
nasty
exhibition
of
our
tempers
we
had
a
very
good
dinner
the
next
day
i
wrote
to
helena
asking
her
what
she
had
really
said
to
the
staveleys
about
her
age
and
mine
and
telling
her
what
i
had
said
i
found
it
too
great
a
trial
of
my
patience
to
wait
till
she
could
see
what
i
had
written
about
the
dispute
in
my
journal
the
days
since
then
have
passed
and
i
have
been
too
lazy
and
stupid
to
keep
my
diary
it
is
different
my
head
is
like
a
dark
room
with
the
light
let
into
it
i
remember
things
i
think
i
can
go
on
again
we
have
religious
exercises
in
this
house
morning
and
evening
just
as
we
do
at
home
not
to
be
compared
with
papa
s
religious
exercises
two
days
ago
his
answer
came
to
staveley
s
letter
he
did
just
what
i
had
expected
said
i
had
spoken
truly
and
disappointed
the
family
by
asking
to
be
excused
if
he
refrained
from
entering
into
explanations
said
very
odd
and
agreed
with
him
young
miss
is
not
quite
as
friendly
now
as
she
was
at
first
and
young
master
was
impudent
enough
to
ask
me
if
i
had
got
to
conclude
the
list
of
my
worries
i
received
an
angry
answer
from
helena
nobody
but
a
simpleton
she
wrote
would
have
contradicted
me
as
you
did
who
but
you
could
have
failed
to
see
that
papa
s
strange
objection
to
let
it
be
known
which
of
us
is
the
elder
makes
us
ridiculous
before
other
people
my
presence
of
mind
prevented
that
you
ought
to
have
been
grateful
and
held
your
perhaps
helena
is
right
but
i
don
t
feel
it
so
on
sunday
we
went
to
chapel
twice
we
also
had
a
sermon
read
at
home
and
a
cold
dinner
in
the
evening
a
hot
dispute
on
religion
between
staveley
and
his
son
i
don
t
blame
them
after
being
pious
all
day
long
on
sunday
i
have
myself
felt
my
piety
give
way
toward
evening
there
is
something
pleasant
in
prospect
for
all
london
is
going
just
now
to
the
exhibition
of
pictures
we
are
going
with
all
london
i
don
t
know
what
is
the
matter
with
me
tonight
i
have
positively
been
to
bed
without
going
to
sleep
after
tossing
and
twisting
and
trying
all
sorts
of
positions
i
am
so
angry
with
myself
that
i
have
got
up
again
rather
than
do
nothing
i
have
opened
my
and
i
mean
to
go
on
with
my
journal
now
i
think
of
it
it
seems
likely
that
the
exhibition
of
works
of
art
may
have
upset
me
i
found
a
dreadfully
large
number
of
pictures
matched
by
a
dreadfully
large
number
of
people
to
look
at
them
it
is
not
possible
for
me
to
write
about
what
i
saw
there
was
too
much
of
it
besides
the
show
disappointed
me
i
would
rather
write
about
a
disagreement
oh
dear
another
dispute
i
had
with
staveley
the
cause
of
it
was
a
famous
artist
not
himself
but
his
works
he
exhibited
four
pictures
what
they
call
figure
subjects
staveley
had
a
pencil
at
every
one
of
the
great
man
s
four
pictures
she
made
a
big
mark
of
admiration
on
her
catalogue
at
the
fourth
one
she
spoke
to
me
perfectly
beautiful
eunice
isn
t
it
i
said
i
didn
t
know
she
said
you
strange
girl
what
do
you
mean
by
that
it
would
have
been
rude
not
to
have
given
the
best
answer
i
could
find
i
said
i
never
saw
the
flesh
of
any
person
s
face
like
the
flesh
in
the
faces
which
that
man
paints
he
reminds
me
of
why
does
he
paint
the
same
waxy
flesh
in
all
four
of
his
pictures
i
don
t
see
the
same
colored
flesh
in
all
the
faces
about
staveley
held
up
her
hand
by
way
of
stopping
me
she
said
don
t
speak
so
loud
eunice
you
are
only
exposing
your
own
a
voice
behind
us
joined
in
the
voice
said
excuse
me
staveley
if
i
expose
ignorance
i
entirely
agree
with
the
young
i
felt
grateful
to
the
person
who
took
my
part
just
when
i
was
at
a
loss
what
to
say
for
myself
and
i
looked
round
the
person
was
a
young
gentleman
he
wore
a
beautiful
blue
buttoned
up
i
like
a
to
be
buttoned
up
he
had
trousers
and
gray
gloves
and
a
pretty
cane
i
like
trousers
and
gray
gloves
and
a
pretty
cane
what
color
his
eyes
were
is
more
than
i
can
say
i
only
know
they
made
me
hot
when
they
looked
at
me
not
that
i
mind
being
made
hot
it
is
surely
better
than
being
made
cold
he
and
staveley
shook
hands
they
seemed
to
be
old
friends
i
wished
i
had
been
an
old
friend
not
for
any
bad
reason
i
hope
i
only
wanted
to
shake
hands
too
what
staveley
said
to
him
escaped
me
somehow
i
think
the
picture
escaped
me
also
i
don
t
remember
noticing
anything
except
the
young
gentleman
especially
when
he
took
off
his
hat
to
me
he
looked
at
me
twice
before
he
went
away
i
got
hot
again
i
said
to
staveley
who
is
he
she
laughed
at
me
i
said
again
who
is
he
she
said
he
is
young
i
said
does
he
live
in
london
she
laughed
again
i
said
again
does
he
live
in
london
she
said
he
is
here
for
a
holiday
he
lives
with
his
father
at
fairmount
in
young
dunboyne
here
for
a
holiday
lives
with
his
father
at
fairmount
in
ireland
i
have
said
that
to
myself
fifty
times
over
and
here
it
is
saying
itself
for
the
time
in
my
journal
i
must
indeed
be
a
simpleton
as
helena
says
i
had
better
go
to
bed
again
chapter
xiii
eunice
s
diary
not
long
before
i
left
home
i
heard
one
of
our
two
servants
telling
the
other
about
a
person
who
had
been
are
you
bewitched
when
you
don
t
understand
your
own
self
that
has
been
my
curious
case
since
i
returned
from
the
picture
show
this
morning
i
took
my
drawing
materials
out
of
my
box
and
tried
to
make
a
portrait
of
young
dunboyne
from
recollection
i
succeeded
pretty
well
with
his
and
cane
but
try
as
i
might
his
face
was
beyond
me
i
have
never
drawn
anything
so
badly
since
i
was
a
little
girl
i
almost
felt
ready
to
cry
what
a
fool
i
am
this
morning
i
received
a
letter
from
papa
it
was
in
reply
to
a
letter
that
i
had
written
to
him
so
kind
so
beautifully
expressed
so
like
himself
that
i
felt
inclined
to
send
him
a
confession
of
the
strange
state
of
feeling
that
has
come
over
me
and
to
ask
him
to
comfort
and
advise
me
on
second
thoughts
i
was
afraid
to
do
it
afraid
of
papa
i
am
further
away
from
understanding
myself
than
ever
dunboyne
paid
us
a
visit
in
the
afternoon
fortunately
before
we
went
out
i
thought
i
would
have
a
good
look
at
him
so
as
to
know
his
face
better
than
i
had
known
it
yet
another
disappointment
was
in
store
for
me
without
intending
it
i
am
sure
he
did
what
no
other
young
man
has
ever
done
he
made
me
feel
confused
instead
of
looking
at
him
i
sat
with
my
head
down
and
listened
to
his
talk
his
voice
this
is
high
praise
reminded
me
of
papa
s
voice
it
seemed
to
persuade
me
as
papa
persuades
his
congregation
i
felt
quite
at
ease
again
when
he
went
away
we
shook
hands
he
gave
my
hand
a
little
squeeze
i
gave
him
back
the
squeeze
without
knowing
why
when
he
was
gone
i
wished
i
had
not
done
it
without
knowing
why
either
i
heard
his
christian
name
for
the
first
time
staveley
said
to
me
we
are
going
to
have
a
shall
i
ask
philip
dunboyne
i
said
to
staveley
oh
do
she
is
an
old
woman
her
eyes
are
dim
at
times
she
can
look
mischievous
she
looked
at
me
mischievously
now
i
wished
i
had
not
been
so
eager
to
have
dunboyne
asked
to
dinner
a
fear
has
come
to
me
that
i
may
have
degraded
myself
my
spirits
are
depressed
this
as
papa
tells
us
in
his
sermons
is
a
miserable
world
i
am
sorry
i
accepted
the
staveleys
invitation
i
am
sorry
i
went
to
see
the
pictures
when
that
young
man
comes
to
dinner
i
shall
say
i
have
got
a
headache
and
shall
stop
upstairs
by
myself
i
don
t
think
i
like
his
christian
name
i
hate
london
i
hate
everybody
what
i
wrote
up
above
yesterday
is
nonsense
i
think
his
christian
name
is
perfect
i
like
london
i
love
everybody
he
came
to
dinner
i
sat
next
to
him
how
beautiful
a
is
and
a
white
cravat
we
talked
he
wanted
to
know
what
my
christian
name
was
i
was
so
pleased
when
i
found
he
was
one
of
the
few
people
who
like
it
his
hair
curls
naturally
in
color
it
is
something
between
my
hair
and
helena
s
he
wears
his
beard
how
manly
it
curls
naturally
like
his
hair
it
smells
deliciously
of
some
perfume
which
is
new
to
me
he
has
white
hands
his
nails
look
as
if
he
polished
them
i
should
like
to
polish
my
nails
if
i
knew
how
whatever
i
said
he
agreed
with
me
i
felt
satisfied
with
my
own
conversation
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
helena
won
t
find
me
a
simpleton
when
i
go
home
what
exquisite
things
are
my
sister
told
me
when
we
said
to
be
particular
in
writing
down
my
true
opinion
of
the
staveleys
helena
wishes
to
compare
what
she
thinks
of
them
with
what
i
think
of
them
my
opinion
of
staveley
is
i
don
t
like
him
my
opinion
of
miss
staveley
is
i
can
t
endure
her
as
for
master
staveley
my
clever
sister
will
understand
that
is
beneath
notice
but
oh
what
a
wonderful
woman
staveley
is
we
went
out
together
after
luncheon
today
for
a
walk
in
kensington
gardens
never
have
i
heard
any
conversation
to
compare
with
staveley
s
helena
shall
enjoy
it
here
at
second
hand
i
am
quite
changed
in
two
things
first
i
think
more
of
myself
than
i
ever
did
before
second
writing
is
no
longer
a
difficulty
to
me
i
could
fill
a
hundred
journals
without
once
stopping
to
think
staveley
began
nicely
i
suppose
eunice
you
have
often
been
told
that
you
have
a
good
figure
and
that
you
walk
well
i
said
helena
thinks
my
figure
is
better
than
my
face
but
do
i
really
walk
well
nobody
ever
told
me
she
answered
philip
dunboyne
thinks
so
he
said
to
me
i
resist
the
temptation
because
i
might
be
wanting
in
respect
if
i
gave
way
to
it
but
i
should
like
to
follow
her
when
she
goes
out
merely
for
the
pleasure
of
seeing
her
i
stood
stockstill
i
said
nothing
when
you
are
as
proud
as
a
peacock
which
never
happened
to
me
before
i
find
you
can
t
move
and
can
t
talk
you
can
only
enjoy
yourself
kind
staveley
had
more
things
to
tell
me
she
said
i
am
interested
in
philip
i
lived
near
fairmount
in
the
time
before
i
was
married
and
in
those
days
he
was
a
child
i
want
him
to
marry
a
charming
girl
and
be
what
made
me
think
directly
of
miss
staveley
what
made
me
mad
to
know
if
she
was
the
charming
girl
i
was
bold
enough
to
ask
the
question
staveley
turned
to
me
with
that
mischievous
look
which
i
have
noticed
already
i
felt
as
if
i
had
been
running
at
the
top
of
my
speed
and
had
not
got
my
breath
again
yet
but
this
good
motherly
friend
set
me
at
my
ease
she
explained
herself
philip
is
not
much
liked
poor
fellow
in
our
house
my
husband
considers
him
to
be
weak
and
vain
and
fickle
and
my
daughter
agrees
with
her
father
there
are
times
when
she
is
barely
civil
to
philip
he
is
too
to
complain
but
see
it
tell
me
my
dear
do
you
like
philip
of
course
i
do
out
it
came
in
those
words
before
i
could
stop
it
was
there
something
unbecoming
to
a
young
lady
in
saying
what
i
had
just
said
staveley
seemed
to
be
more
amused
than
angry
with
me
she
took
my
arm
kindly
and
led
me
along
with
her
my
dear
you
are
as
clear
as
crystal
and
as
true
as
steel
you
are
a
favorite
of
mine
what
a
delightful
woman
as
i
said
just
now
i
asked
if
she
really
liked
me
as
well
as
she
liked
my
sister
she
said
i
didn
t
expect
that
and
didn
t
want
it
helena
is
my
superior
she
is
prettier
than
i
am
cleverer
than
i
am
better
worth
liking
than
i
am
staveley
shifted
the
talk
back
to
philip
i
ought
to
have
said
philip
no
i
won
t
i
shall
call
him
philip
if
i
had
a
heart
of
stone
i
should
feel
interested
in
him
after
what
staveley
has
told
me
such
a
sad
story
in
some
respects
mother
dead
no
brothers
or
sisters
only
the
father
left
he
lives
a
dismal
life
on
a
lonely
stormy
coast
not
a
severe
old
gentleman
for
all
that
his
reasons
for
taking
to
retirement
are
reasons
so
staveley
says
which
nobody
knows
he
buries
himself
among
his
books
in
an
immense
library
and
he
appears
to
like
it
his
son
has
not
been
brought
up
like
other
young
men
at
school
and
college
he
is
a
great
scholar
educated
at
home
by
his
father
to
hear
this
account
of
his
learning
depressed
me
it
seemed
to
put
such
a
distance
between
us
i
asked
staveley
if
he
thought
me
ignorant
as
long
as
i
live
i
shall
remember
the
reply
he
thinks
you
any
other
girl
would
have
been
satisfied
with
this
i
am
the
miserable
creature
who
is
always
making
mistakes
my
stupid
curiosity
spoiled
the
charm
of
staveley
s
conversation
and
yet
it
seemed
to
be
a
harmless
question
i
only
said
i
should
like
to
know
what
profession
philip
belonged
to
staveley
answered
no
i
foolishly
put
a
wrong
meaning
on
this
i
said
is
he
idle
staveley
laughed
my
dear
he
is
an
only
son
and
his
father
is
a
rich
that
stopped
me
at
last
we
have
enough
to
live
on
in
comfort
at
home
no
more
papa
has
told
us
himself
that
he
is
not
and
can
never
hope
to
be
a
rich
man
this
is
not
the
worst
of
it
last
year
he
refused
to
marry
a
young
couple
both
belonging
to
our
congregation
this
was
very
unlike
his
usual
kind
self
helena
and
i
asked
him
for
his
reasons
they
were
reasons
that
did
not
take
long
to
give
the
young
gentleman
s
father
was
a
rich
man
he
had
forbidden
his
son
to
marry
a
sweet
girl
because
she
had
no
fortune
i
have
no
fortune
and
philip
s
father
is
a
rich
man
the
best
thing
i
can
do
is
to
wipe
my
pen
and
shut
up
my
journal
and
go
home
by
the
next
train
i
have
a
great
mind
to
burn
my
journal
it
tells
me
that
i
had
better
not
think
of
philip
any
more
on
second
thoughts
i
won
t
destroy
my
journal
i
will
only
put
it
away
if
i
live
to
be
an
old
woman
it
may
amuse
me
to
open
my
book
again
and
see
how
foolish
the
poor
wretch
was
when
she
was
young
what
is
this
aching
pain
in
my
heart
i
don
t
remember
it
at
any
other
time
in
my
life
is
it
trouble
how
can
i
tell
i
have
had
so
little
trouble
it
must
be
many
years
since
i
was
wretched
enough
to
cry
i
don
t
even
understand
why
i
am
crying
now
my
last
sorrow
so
far
as
i
can
remember
was
the
toothache
other
girls
mothers
comfort
them
when
they
are
wretched
if
my
mother
had
lived
it
s
useless
to
think
about
that
we
lost
her
while
i
and
my
sister
were
too
young
to
understand
our
misfortune
i
wish
i
had
never
seen
philip
this
seems
an
ungrateful
wish
seeing
him
at
the
was
a
new
enjoyment
sitting
next
to
him
at
dinner
was
a
happiness
that
i
don
t
recollect
feeling
even
when
papa
has
been
most
sweet
and
kind
to
me
i
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
myself
to
confess
this
shall
i
write
to
my
sister
but
how
should
she
know
what
is
the
matter
with
me
when
i
don
t
know
it
myself
besides
helena
is
angry
she
wrote
unkindly
to
me
when
she
answered
my
last
letter
there
is
a
dreadful
loneliness
in
this
great
house
at
night
i
had
better
say
my
prayers
and
try
to
sleep
if
it
doesn
t
make
me
feel
happier
it
will
prevent
me
spoiling
my
journal
by
dropping
tears
on
it
what
an
evening
of
evenings
this
has
been
last
night
it
was
crying
that
kept
me
awake
i
can
t
sleep
for
joy
philip
called
on
us
again
he
brought
with
him
tickets
for
the
performance
of
an
oratorio
sacred
music
is
not
forbidden
music
among
our
people
staveley
and
miss
staveley
went
to
the
concert
with
us
philip
and
i
sat
next
to
each
other
my
sister
is
a
musician
i
am
nothing
that
sounds
bitter
but
i
don
t
mean
it
so
all
i
mean
is
that
i
like
simple
little
songs
which
i
can
sing
to
myself
by
remembering
the
tune
there
my
musical
enjoyment
ends
when
voices
and
instruments
burst
out
together
by
hundreds
i
feel
bewildered
i
also
get
attacked
by
fidgets
this
last
misfortune
is
sure
to
overtake
me
when
choruses
are
being
performed
the
unfortunate
people
employed
are
made
to
keep
singing
the
same
words
over
and
over
and
over
again
till
i
find
it
a
perfect
misery
to
listen
to
them
the
choruses
were
unendurable
in
the
performance
this
is
one
of
them
here
we
are
all
alone
in
the
wilderness
alone
in
the
wilderness
in
the
wilderness
alone
alone
alone
here
we
are
in
the
wilderness
alone
in
the
wilderness
all
all
alone
in
the
wilderness
and
soon
till
i
felt
inclined
to
call
for
the
learned
person
who
writes
oratorios
and
beg
him
to
give
the
poor
music
a
more
generous
allowance
of
words
whenever
i
looked
at
philip
i
found
him
looking
at
me
perhaps
he
saw
from
the
first
that
the
music
was
wearying
music
to
my
ignorant
ears
with
his
usual
delicacy
he
said
nothing
for
some
time
but
when
he
caught
me
yawning
though
i
did
my
best
to
hide
it
for
it
looked
like
being
ungrateful
for
the
tickets
then
he
could
restrain
himself
no
longer
he
whispered
in
my
ear
you
are
getting
tired
of
this
and
so
am
i
am
trying
to
like
it
i
whispered
back
don
t
try
he
answered
let
s
he
meant
of
course
talk
in
whispers
we
were
a
good
deal
annoyed
especially
when
the
characters
were
all
alone
in
the
wilderness
by
bursts
of
singing
and
playing
which
interrupted
us
at
the
most
interesting
moments
philip
persevered
with
a
manly
firmness
what
could
i
do
but
follow
his
example
at
a
distance
he
said
is
it
really
true
that
your
visit
to
staveley
is
coming
to
an
end
i
answered
it
comes
to
an
end
the
day
after
are
you
sorry
to
be
leaving
your
friends
in
london
what
i
might
have
said
if
he
had
made
that
inquiry
a
day
earlier
when
i
was
the
most
miserable
creature
living
i
would
rather
not
try
to
guess
being
quite
happy
as
things
were
i
could
honestly
tell
him
i
was
sorry
you
can
t
possibly
be
as
sorry
as
i
am
eunice
may
i
call
you
by
your
pretty
name
yes
if
you
eunice
you
will
leave
a
blank
in
my
life
when
you
go
away
there
another
chorus
stopped
him
just
as
i
was
eager
for
more
it
was
such
a
delightfully
new
sensation
to
hear
a
young
gentleman
telling
me
that
i
had
left
a
blank
in
his
life
the
next
change
in
the
oratorio
brought
up
a
young
lady
singing
alone
some
people
behind
us
grumbled
at
the
smallness
of
her
voice
we
thought
her
voice
perfect
it
seemed
to
lend
itself
so
nicely
to
our
whispers
he
said
will
you
help
me
to
think
of
you
while
you
are
away
i
want
to
imagine
what
your
life
is
at
home
do
you
live
in
a
town
or
in
the
country
i
told
him
the
name
of
our
town
when
we
give
a
person
information
i
have
always
heard
that
we
ought
to
make
it
complete
so
i
mentioned
our
address
in
the
town
but
i
was
troubled
by
a
doubt
perhaps
he
preferred
the
country
being
anxious
about
this
i
said
would
you
rather
have
heard
that
i
live
in
the
country
live
where
you
may
eunice
the
place
will
be
a
favorite
place
of
mine
besides
your
town
is
famous
it
has
a
public
attraction
which
brings
visitors
to
i
made
another
of
those
mistakes
which
no
sensible
girl
in
my
position
would
have
committed
i
asked
if
he
alluded
to
our
new
he
set
me
right
in
the
sweetest
manner
i
alluded
to
a
building
hundreds
of
years
older
than
your
your
beautiful
fancy
my
not
having
thought
of
the
cathedral
this
is
what
comes
of
being
a
congregationalist
if
i
had
belonged
to
the
church
of
england
i
should
have
forgotten
the
and
remembered
the
cathedral
not
that
i
want
to
belong
to
the
church
of
england
papa
s
chapel
is
good
enough
for
me
the
song
sung
by
the
lady
with
the
small
voice
was
so
pretty
that
the
audience
encored
it
didn
t
philip
and
i
help
them
with
the
sweetest
smiles
the
lady
sang
it
all
over
again
the
people
behind
us
left
the
concert
he
said
do
you
know
i
take
the
greatest
interest
in
cathedrals
i
propose
to
enjoy
the
privilege
and
pleasure
of
seeing
cathedral
early
next
i
had
only
to
look
at
him
to
see
that
i
was
the
cathedral
it
was
no
surprise
to
hear
next
that
he
thought
of
paying
his
respects
to
he
begged
me
to
tell
him
what
sort
of
reception
he
might
hope
to
meet
with
when
he
called
at
our
house
i
got
so
excited
in
doing
justice
to
papa
that
i
quite
forgot
to
whisper
when
the
next
question
came
philip
wanted
to
know
if
gracedieu
disliked
strangers
when
i
answered
oh
dear
no
i
said
it
out
loud
so
that
the
people
heard
me
cruel
cruel
people
they
all
turned
round
and
stared
one
hideous
old
woman
actually
said
silence
miss
staveley
looked
disgusted
even
kind
staveley
lifted
her
eyebrows
in
astonishment
philip
dear
philip
protected
and
composed
me
he
held
my
hand
devotedly
till
the
end
of
the
performance
when
he
put
us
into
the
carriage
i
was
last
he
whispered
in
my
ear
expect
me
next
miss
staveley
might
be
as
as
she
pleased
on
the
way
home
it
didn
t
matter
what
she
said
the
eunice
of
yesterday
might
have
been
mortified
and
offended
the
eunice
of
was
indifferent
to
the
sharpest
things
that
could
be
said
to
her
all
through
yesterday
s
delightful
evening
i
never
once
thought
of
philip
s
father
when
i
woke
this
morning
i
remembered
that
old
dunboyne
was
a
rich
man
i
could
eat
no
breakfast
for
thinking
of
the
poor
girl
who
was
not
allowed
to
marry
her
young
gentleman
because
she
had
no
money
staveley
waited
to
speak
to
me
till
the
rest
of
them
had
left
us
together
i
had
expected
her
to
notice
that
i
looked
dull
and
dismal
no
her
cleverness
got
at
my
secret
in
quite
another
way
she
said
how
do
you
feel
after
the
concert
you
must
be
hard
to
please
indeed
if
you
were
not
satisfied
with
the
accompaniments
last
the
accompaniments
of
the
oratorio
no
my
dear
the
accompaniments
of
i
suppose
i
ought
to
have
laughed
in
my
miserable
state
of
mind
it
was
not
to
be
done
i
said
i
hope
dunboyne
s
father
will
not
hear
how
kind
he
was
to
staveley
asked
why
my
bitterness
overflowed
at
my
tongue
i
said
because
papa
is
a
poor
and
philip
s
papa
is
a
rich
man
says
staveley
putting
my
own
thought
into
words
for
me
where
do
you
get
these
ideas
eunice
surely
you
are
not
allowed
to
read
novels
oh
no
and
you
have
certainly
never
seen
a
play
clear
your
head
child
of
the
nonsense
that
has
got
into
it
i
can
t
think
how
rich
dunboyne
has
taught
his
heir
to
despise
the
base
act
of
marrying
for
money
he
knows
that
philip
will
meet
young
ladies
at
my
house
and
he
has
written
to
me
on
the
subject
of
his
son
s
choice
of
a
wife
let
philip
find
good
principles
good
temper
and
good
looks
and
i
promise
beforehand
to
find
the
there
is
what
he
says
are
you
satisfied
with
philip
s
father
now
i
jumped
up
in
a
state
of
ecstasy
just
as
i
had
thrown
my
arms
round
staveley
s
neck
the
servant
came
in
with
a
letter
and
handed
it
to
me
helena
had
written
again
on
this
last
day
of
my
visit
her
letter
was
full
of
instructions
for
buying
things
that
she
wants
before
i
leave
london
i
read
on
quietly
enough
until
i
came
to
the
postscript
the
effect
of
it
on
me
may
be
told
in
two
words
i
screamed
staveley
was
naturally
alarmed
bad
news
she
asked
being
quite
unable
to
offer
an
opinion
i
read
the
postscript
out
loud
and
left
her
to
judge
for
herself
this
was
helena
s
news
from
home
i
must
prepare
you
for
a
surprise
before
your
return
you
will
find
a
strange
lady
established
at
home
don
t
suppose
there
is
any
prospect
of
her
bidding
us
if
we
only
wait
long
enough
she
is
already
with
father
s
full
approval
as
much
a
member
of
the
family
as
we
are
you
shall
form
your
own
unbiased
opinion
of
her
eunice
for
the
present
i
say
no
i
asked
staveley
what
she
thought
of
my
news
from
home
she
said
your
father
approves
of
the
lady
my
dear
i
suppose
it
s
good
but
staveley
did
not
look
as
if
she
believed
in
the
good
news
for
all
that
chapter
xiv
helena
s
diary
i
went
as
usual
to
the
for
girls
it
was
harder
work
than
ever
teaching
without
eunice
to
help
me
indeed
i
felt
lonely
all
day
without
my
sister
when
i
got
home
i
rather
hoped
that
some
friend
might
have
come
to
see
us
and
have
been
asked
to
stay
to
tea
the
housemaid
opened
the
door
to
me
i
asked
maria
if
anybody
had
called
yes
miss
a
lady
to
see
the
a
stranger
never
saw
her
before
miss
in
all
my
i
put
no
more
questions
many
ladies
visit
my
father
they
call
it
consulting
the
minister
he
advises
them
in
their
troubles
and
guides
them
in
their
religious
difficulties
and
so
on
they
come
and
go
in
a
sort
of
secrecy
so
far
as
i
know
they
are
mostly
old
maids
and
they
waste
the
minister
s
time
when
my
father
came
in
to
tea
i
began
to
feel
some
curiosity
about
the
lady
who
had
called
on
him
visitors
of
that
sort
in
general
never
appear
to
dwell
on
his
mind
after
they
have
gone
away
he
sees
too
many
of
them
and
is
too
well
accustomed
to
what
they
have
to
say
on
this
particular
evening
however
i
perceived
appearances
that
set
me
thinking
he
looked
worried
and
anxious
has
anything
happened
father
to
vex
you
i
said
is
the
lady
concerned
in
it
what
lady
my
dear
the
lady
who
called
on
you
while
i
was
who
told
you
she
had
called
on
me
i
asked
maria
that
will
do
helena
for
the
he
drank
his
tea
and
went
back
to
his
study
instead
of
staying
a
while
and
talking
pleasantly
as
usual
my
respect
submitted
to
his
want
of
confidence
in
me
but
my
curiosity
was
in
a
state
of
revolt
i
sent
for
maria
and
proceeded
to
make
my
own
discoveries
with
this
result
no
other
person
had
called
at
the
house
nothing
had
happened
except
the
visit
of
the
mysterious
lady
she
looked
between
young
and
old
and
oh
dear
me
she
was
certainly
not
pretty
not
dressed
nicely
to
my
mind
but
they
do
say
dress
is
a
matter
of
try
as
i
might
i
could
get
no
more
than
that
out
of
our
stupid
young
housemaid
later
in
the
evening
the
cook
had
occasion
to
consult
me
about
supper
this
was
a
person
possessing
the
advantages
of
age
and
experience
i
asked
if
she
had
seen
the
lady
the
cook
s
reply
promised
something
new
i
can
t
say
i
saw
the
lady
but
i
heard
do
you
mean
that
you
heard
her
speaking
no
miss
where
was
she
crying
in
the
master
s
how
did
you
come
to
hear
her
am
i
to
understand
miss
that
you
suspect
me
of
listening
is
a
lie
told
by
a
look
as
bad
as
a
lie
told
by
words
i
looked
shocked
at
the
bare
idea
of
suspecting
a
respectable
person
of
listening
the
cook
s
sense
of
honor
was
satisfied
she
readily
explained
herself
i
was
passing
the
door
miss
on
my
way
here
my
discoveries
came
to
an
end
it
was
certainly
possible
that
an
afflicted
member
of
my
father
s
congregation
might
have
called
on
him
to
be
comforted
but
he
sees
plenty
of
afflicted
ladies
without
looking
worried
and
anxious
after
they
leave
him
still
suspecting
something
out
of
the
ordinary
course
of
events
i
waited
hopefully
for
our
next
meeting
at
nothing
came
of
it
my
father
left
me
by
myself
again
when
the
meal
was
over
he
is
always
courteous
to
his
daughters
and
he
made
an
apology
excuse
me
helena
i
want
to
i
went
to
bed
in
a
vile
humor
and
slept
badly
wondering
in
the
long
wakeful
hours
what
new
rebuff
i
should
meet
with
on
the
next
day
at
breakfast
this
morning
i
was
agreeably
surprised
no
signs
of
anxiety
showed
themselves
in
my
father
s
face
instead
of
retiring
to
his
study
when
we
rose
from
the
table
he
proposed
taking
a
turn
in
the
garden
you
are
looking
pale
helena
and
you
will
be
the
better
for
a
little
fresh
air
besides
i
have
something
to
say
to
excitement
i
am
sure
is
good
for
young
women
i
saw
in
his
face
i
heard
in
his
last
words
that
the
mystery
of
the
lady
was
at
last
to
be
revealed
the
sensation
of
languor
and
fatigue
which
follows
a
disturbed
night
left
me
directly
my
father
gave
me
his
arm
and
we
walked
slowly
up
and
down
the
lawn
when
that
lady
called
on
me
yesterday
he
began
you
wanted
to
know
who
she
was
and
you
were
surprised
and
disappointed
when
i
refused
to
gratify
your
curiosity
my
silence
was
not
a
selfish
silence
helena
i
was
thinking
of
you
and
your
sister
and
i
was
at
a
loss
how
to
act
for
the
best
you
shall
hear
why
my
children
were
in
my
mind
presently
i
must
tell
you
first
that
i
have
arrived
at
a
decision
i
hope
and
believe
on
reasonable
grounds
ask
me
any
questions
you
please
my
silence
will
be
no
longer
an
obstacle
in
your
this
was
so
very
encouraging
that
i
said
at
once
i
should
like
to
know
who
the
lady
the
lady
is
related
to
me
he
answered
we
are
here
was
a
disclosure
that
i
had
not
anticipated
in
the
little
that
i
have
seen
of
the
world
i
have
observed
that
cousins
when
they
happen
to
be
brought
together
under
interesting
circumstances
can
remember
their
relationship
and
forget
their
relationship
just
as
it
suits
them
is
your
cousin
a
married
lady
i
ventured
to
inquire
short
as
it
was
that
reply
might
perhaps
mean
more
than
appeared
on
the
surface
the
cook
had
heard
the
lady
crying
what
sort
of
tender
agitation
was
answerable
for
those
tears
was
it
possible
barely
possible
that
eunice
and
i
might
go
to
bed
one
night
a
widower
s
daughters
and
wake
up
the
next
day
to
discover
a
stepmother
have
i
or
my
sister
ever
seen
the
lady
i
asked
never
she
has
been
living
abroad
and
i
have
not
seen
her
myself
since
we
were
both
young
my
excellent
innocent
father
not
the
faintest
idea
of
what
i
had
been
thinking
of
was
in
his
mind
little
did
he
suspect
how
welcome
was
the
relief
that
he
had
afforded
to
his
daughter
s
wicked
doubts
of
him
but
he
had
not
said
a
word
yet
about
his
cousin
s
personal
appearance
there
might
be
remains
of
good
looks
which
the
housemaid
was
too
stupid
to
discover
after
the
long
interval
that
has
passed
since
you
met
i
said
i
suppose
she
has
become
an
old
woman
no
my
dear
let
us
say
a
perhaps
she
is
still
an
attractive
person
he
smiled
i
am
afraid
helena
that
would
never
have
been
a
very
accurate
description
of
i
now
knew
all
that
i
wanted
to
know
about
this
alarming
person
excepting
one
last
morsel
of
information
which
my
father
had
strangely
forgotten
we
have
been
talking
about
the
lady
for
some
time
i
said
and
you
have
not
yet
told
me
her
father
looked
a
little
embarrassed
it
s
not
a
very
pretty
name
he
answered
my
cousin
my
unfortunate
cousin
is
miss
i
burst
out
with
such
a
loud
oh
that
he
laughed
i
caught
the
infection
and
laughed
louder
still
bless
miss
jillgall
the
interview
promised
to
become
an
easy
one
for
both
of
us
thanks
to
her
name
i
was
in
good
spirits
and
i
made
no
attempt
to
restrain
them
the
next
time
miss
jillgall
honors
you
with
a
visit
i
said
you
must
give
me
an
opportunity
of
being
presented
to
he
made
a
strange
reply
you
may
find
your
opportunity
helena
sooner
than
you
did
this
mean
that
she
was
going
to
call
again
in
a
day
or
two
i
am
afraid
i
spoke
flippantly
i
said
oh
father
another
lady
fascinated
by
the
popular
preacher
the
garden
chairs
were
near
us
he
signed
to
me
gravely
to
be
seated
by
his
side
and
said
to
himself
this
is
my
what
is
your
fault
i
asked
i
have
left
you
in
ignorance
my
dear
of
my
cousin
s
sad
story
it
is
soon
told
and
if
it
checks
your
merriment
it
will
make
amends
by
deserving
your
sympathy
i
was
indebted
to
her
father
when
i
was
a
boy
for
acts
of
kindness
which
i
can
never
forget
he
was
twice
married
the
death
of
his
first
wife
left
him
with
one
child
once
my
playfellow
now
the
lady
whose
visit
has
excited
your
curiosity
his
second
wife
was
a
belgian
she
persuaded
him
to
sell
his
business
in
london
and
to
invest
the
money
in
a
partnership
with
a
brother
of
hers
established
as
a
at
antwerp
the
little
daughter
accompanied
her
father
to
belgium
are
you
attending
to
me
helena
i
was
waiting
for
the
interesting
part
of
the
story
and
was
wondering
when
he
would
get
to
it
as
time
went
on
he
resumed
the
new
partner
found
that
the
value
of
the
business
at
antwerp
had
been
greatly
overrated
after
a
long
struggle
with
adverse
circumstances
he
decided
on
withdrawing
from
the
partnership
before
the
whole
of
his
capital
was
lost
in
a
failing
commercial
speculation
the
end
of
it
was
that
he
retired
with
his
daughter
to
a
small
town
in
east
flanders
the
wreck
of
his
property
having
left
him
with
an
income
of
no
more
than
two
hundred
pounds
a
i
showed
my
father
that
i
was
attending
to
him
now
by
inquiring
what
had
become
of
the
belgian
wife
those
nervous
quiverings
which
eunice
has
mentioned
in
her
diary
began
to
appear
in
his
face
it
is
too
shameful
a
story
he
said
to
be
told
to
a
young
girl
the
marriage
was
dissolved
by
law
and
the
wife
was
the
person
to
blame
i
am
sure
helena
you
don
t
wish
to
hear
any
more
of
part
of
the
i
did
wish
but
i
saw
that
he
expected
me
to
say
no
so
i
said
it
the
father
and
daughter
he
went
on
never
so
much
as
thought
of
returning
to
their
own
country
they
were
too
poor
to
live
comfortably
in
england
in
belgium
their
income
was
sufficient
for
their
wants
on
the
father
s
death
the
daughter
remained
in
the
town
she
had
friends
there
and
friends
nowhere
else
and
she
might
have
lived
abroad
to
the
end
of
her
days
but
for
a
calamity
to
which
we
are
all
liable
a
long
and
serious
illness
completely
prostrated
her
skilled
medical
attendance
costing
large
sums
of
money
for
the
doctors
traveling
expenses
was
imperatively
required
experienced
nurses
summoned
from
a
distant
hospital
were
in
attendance
night
and
day
luxuries
far
beyond
the
reach
of
her
little
income
were
absolutely
required
to
support
her
wasted
strength
at
the
time
of
her
tedious
recovery
in
one
word
her
resources
were
sadly
diminished
when
the
poor
creature
had
paid
her
debts
and
had
regained
her
hold
on
life
at
that
time
she
unhappily
met
with
the
man
who
has
ruined
it
was
getting
interesting
at
last
ruined
her
i
repeated
do
you
mean
that
he
robbed
her
that
helena
is
exactly
what
i
mean
and
many
and
many
a
helpless
woman
has
been
robbed
in
the
same
way
the
man
of
whom
i
am
now
speaking
was
a
lawyer
in
large
practice
he
bore
an
excellent
character
and
was
highly
respected
for
his
exemplary
life
my
cousin
not
at
all
a
discreet
person
i
am
bound
to
admit
was
induced
to
consult
him
on
her
pecuniary
affairs
he
expressed
the
most
generous
sympathy
offered
to
employ
her
little
capital
in
his
business
and
pledged
himself
to
pay
her
double
the
interest
for
her
money
which
she
had
been
in
the
habit
of
receiving
from
the
sound
investment
chosen
by
her
and
of
course
he
got
the
money
and
never
paid
the
interest
eager
to
hear
the
end
i
interrupted
the
story
in
those
inconsiderate
words
my
father
s
answer
quietly
reproved
me
he
paid
the
interest
regularly
as
long
as
he
and
what
happened
when
he
died
he
died
a
bankrupt
the
secret
profligacy
of
his
life
was
at
last
exposed
nothing
actually
nothing
was
left
for
his
creditors
the
unfortunate
creature
whose
ugly
name
has
amused
you
must
get
help
somewhere
or
must
go
to
the
if
i
had
been
in
a
state
of
mind
to
attend
to
trifles
this
would
have
explained
the
reason
why
the
cook
had
heard
miss
jillgall
crying
but
the
prospect
before
me
the
unendurable
prospect
of
having
a
strange
woman
in
the
house
had
showed
itself
too
plainly
to
be
mistaken
i
could
think
of
nothing
else
with
infinite
difficulty
i
assumed
a
momentary
appearance
of
composure
and
suggested
that
miss
jillgall
s
foreign
friends
might
have
done
something
to
help
her
my
father
defended
her
foreign
friends
my
dear
they
were
poor
people
and
did
all
they
could
afford
to
do
but
for
their
kindness
my
cousin
might
not
have
been
able
to
return
to
and
to
cast
herself
on
your
mercy
i
added
in
the
character
of
a
helpless
no
helena
not
to
cast
herself
on
my
mercy
but
to
find
my
house
open
to
her
as
her
father
s
house
was
open
to
me
in
the
bygone
time
i
am
her
only
surviving
relative
and
while
i
live
she
shall
not
be
a
helpless
i
began
to
wish
that
i
had
not
spoken
out
so
plainly
my
father
s
sweet
temper
i
do
so
sincerely
wish
i
had
inherited
it
made
the
kindest
allowances
for
me
i
understand
the
momentary
bitterness
of
feeling
that
has
escaped
you
he
said
i
may
almost
say
that
i
expected
it
my
only
hesitation
in
this
matter
has
been
caused
by
my
sense
of
what
i
owe
to
my
children
it
was
putting
your
endurance
and
your
sister
s
endurance
to
a
trial
to
expect
you
to
receive
a
stranger
and
that
stranger
not
a
young
girl
like
yourselves
as
one
of
the
household
living
with
you
in
the
closest
intimacy
of
family
life
the
consideration
which
has
decided
me
does
justice
i
hope
to
you
and
eunice
as
well
as
to
myself
i
think
that
some
allowance
is
due
from
my
daughters
to
the
father
who
has
always
made
loving
allowance
for
am
i
wrong
in
believing
that
my
good
children
have
not
forgotten
this
and
have
only
waited
for
the
occasion
to
feel
the
pleasure
of
rewarding
me
it
was
beautifully
put
there
was
but
one
thing
to
be
done
i
kissed
him
and
there
was
but
one
thing
to
be
said
i
asked
at
what
time
we
might
expect
to
receive
miss
jillgall
she
is
staying
helena
at
a
small
hotel
in
the
town
i
have
already
sent
to
say
that
we
are
waiting
to
see
her
perhaps
you
will
look
at
the
spare
bedroom
it
shall
be
got
ready
father
i
ran
into
the
house
i
rushed
upstairs
into
the
room
that
is
eunice
s
and
mine
i
locked
the
door
and
then
i
gave
way
to
my
rage
before
it
stifled
me
i
stamped
on
the
floor
i
clinched
my
fists
i
cast
myself
on
the
bed
i
reviled
that
hateful
woman
by
every
hard
word
that
i
could
throw
at
her
oh
the
luxury
of
it
the
luxury
of
it
cold
water
and
my
hairbrush
soon
made
me
fit
to
be
seen
again
as
for
the
spare
room
it
looked
a
great
deal
too
comfortable
for
an
incubus
from
foreign
parts
the
one
improvement
that
i
could
have
made
if
a
friend
of
mine
had
been
expected
was
suggested
by
the
i
was
looking
at
a
torn
place
in
one
of
them
and
determined
to
leave
it
unrepaired
when
i
felt
an
arm
slipped
round
my
waist
from
behind
a
voice
so
close
that
it
tickled
my
neck
said
dear
girl
what
friends
we
shall
be
i
turned
round
and
confronted
miss
jillgall
chapter
xv
helena
s
diary
if
i
am
not
a
good
girl
where
is
a
good
girl
to
be
found
this
is
in
eunice
s
style
it
sometimes
amuses
me
to
mimic
my
simple
sister
i
have
just
torn
three
pages
out
of
my
diary
in
deference
to
the
expression
of
my
father
s
wishes
he
took
the
first
opportunity
which
his
cousin
permitted
him
to
enjoy
of
speaking
to
me
privately
and
his
object
was
to
caution
me
against
hastily
relying
on
first
impressions
of
anybody
especially
of
miss
jillgall
wait
for
a
day
or
two
he
said
and
then
form
your
estimate
of
the
new
member
of
our
the
stormy
state
of
my
temper
had
passed
away
and
had
left
my
atmosphere
calm
again
i
could
feel
that
i
had
received
good
advice
but
unluckily
it
reached
me
too
late
i
had
formed
my
estimate
of
miss
jillgall
and
had
put
it
in
writing
for
my
own
satisfaction
at
least
an
hour
before
my
father
found
himself
at
liberty
to
speak
to
me
i
don
t
agree
with
him
in
distrusting
first
impressions
and
i
had
proposed
to
put
my
opinion
to
the
test
by
referring
to
what
i
had
written
about
his
cousin
at
a
later
time
however
after
what
he
had
said
to
me
i
felt
bound
in
filial
duty
to
take
the
pages
out
of
my
book
and
to
let
two
days
pass
before
i
presumed
to
enjoy
the
luxury
of
hating
miss
jillgall
on
one
thing
i
am
determined
eunice
shall
not
form
a
hasty
opinion
either
she
shall
undergo
the
same
severe
discipline
of
to
which
her
sister
is
obliged
to
submit
let
us
be
just
as
somebody
says
before
we
are
generous
no
more
for
i
open
my
diary
again
after
the
prescribed
interval
has
elapsed
the
first
impression
produced
on
me
by
the
new
member
of
our
household
remains
entirely
unchanged
have
i
already
made
the
remark
that
when
one
removes
a
page
from
a
book
it
does
not
necessarily
follow
that
one
destroys
the
page
afterward
or
did
i
leave
this
to
be
inferred
in
either
case
my
course
of
proceeding
was
the
same
i
ordered
some
paste
to
be
made
then
i
unlocked
a
drawer
and
found
my
poor
leaves
and
put
them
back
in
my
journal
an
act
of
justice
is
surely
not
the
less
praiseworthy
because
it
is
an
act
of
justice
done
to
one
s
self
my
father
has
often
told
me
that
he
revises
his
writings
on
religious
subjects
i
may
harmlessly
imitate
that
good
example
by
revising
my
restored
entry
it
is
now
a
sufficiently
remarkable
performance
to
be
distinguished
by
a
title
let
me
call
it
impressions
of
miss
jillgall
my
first
impression
was
a
strong
one
it
was
produced
by
the
state
of
this
lady
s
breath
in
other
words
i
was
obliged
to
let
her
kiss
me
it
is
a
duty
to
be
considerate
toward
human
infirmity
i
will
only
say
that
i
thought
i
should
have
fainted
my
second
impression
draws
a
portrait
and
produces
a
striking
likeness
figure
little
and
lean
hair
of
a
dirty
drab
color
which
we
see
in
string
small
light
gray
eyes
sly
and
restless
and
deeply
sunk
in
the
head
prominent
cheekbones
and
a
florid
complexion
an
inquisitive
nose
turning
up
at
the
end
a
large
mouth
and
a
servile
smile
hands
decorated
with
black
mittens
a
misfitting
white
jacket
and
a
limp
skirt
manners
familiar
temper
cleverly
hidden
voice
too
irritating
to
be
mentioned
whose
portrait
is
this
it
is
the
portrait
of
miss
jillgall
taken
in
words
her
true
character
is
not
easy
to
discover
i
suspect
that
it
will
only
show
itself
little
by
little
that
she
is
a
born
meddler
in
other
people
s
affairs
i
think
i
can
see
already
i
also
found
out
that
she
trusted
to
flattery
as
the
easiest
means
of
making
herself
agreeable
she
tried
her
first
experiment
on
myself
you
charming
girl
she
began
your
bright
face
encourages
me
to
ask
a
favor
pray
make
me
useful
the
one
aspiration
of
my
life
is
to
be
useful
unless
you
employ
me
in
that
way
i
have
no
right
to
intrude
myself
into
your
family
circle
yes
yes
i
know
that
your
father
has
opened
his
house
and
his
heart
to
me
but
i
dare
not
found
any
claim
your
name
is
helena
isn
t
it
dear
helena
i
dare
not
found
any
claim
on
what
i
owe
to
your
father
s
why
not
i
inquired
because
your
father
is
not
a
man
i
was
rude
enough
to
interrupt
her
what
is
he
then
an
angel
miss
jillgall
answered
solemnly
a
destitute
earthly
creature
like
me
must
not
look
up
as
high
as
your
father
i
might
be
this
was
rather
more
than
i
could
endure
patiently
let
us
try
i
suggested
if
we
can
t
understand
each
other
at
miss
jillgall
s
little
eyes
twinkled
in
their
bony
caverns
the
very
thing
i
was
going
to
propose
she
burst
out
very
well
i
went
on
then
let
me
tell
you
plainly
that
flattery
is
not
relished
in
this
flattery
she
put
her
hand
to
her
head
as
she
repeated
the
word
and
looked
quite
bewildered
dear
helena
i
have
lived
all
my
life
in
east
flanders
and
my
own
language
is
occasionally
strange
to
me
can
you
tell
me
what
flattery
is
in
flemish
i
don
t
understand
how
very
provoking
you
don
t
understand
flemish
and
i
don
t
understand
flattery
i
should
so
like
to
know
what
it
means
ah
i
see
books
in
this
lovely
room
is
there
a
dictionary
among
them
she
darted
to
the
bookcase
and
discovered
a
dictionary
now
i
shall
understand
flattery
she
remarked
and
then
we
shall
understand
each
other
oh
let
me
find
it
for
myself
she
ran
her
raw
red
finger
along
the
alphabetical
headings
at
the
top
of
each
page
that
won
t
do
further
on
still
too
far
the
other
way
here
we
are
flattery
false
praise
commendation
bestowed
for
the
purpose
of
gaining
favor
and
oh
helena
how
cruel
of
you
she
dropped
the
book
and
sank
into
a
chair
the
picture
if
such
a
thing
can
be
of
a
old
maid
i
should
most
assuredly
have
taken
the
opportunity
of
leaving
her
to
her
own
devices
if
i
had
been
free
to
act
as
i
pleased
but
my
interests
as
a
daughter
forbade
me
to
make
an
enemy
of
my
father
s
cousin
on
the
first
day
when
she
had
entered
the
house
i
made
an
apology
very
neatly
expressed
she
jumped
up
let
me
do
her
justice
miss
jillgall
is
as
nimble
as
a
monkey
and
faugh
she
kissed
me
for
the
second
time
if
i
had
been
a
man
i
am
afraid
i
should
have
called
for
that
deadly
poison
we
are
all
temperance
people
in
this
house
known
by
the
name
of
brandy
if
you
will
make
me
love
you
miss
jillgall
explained
you
must
expect
to
be
kissed
dear
girl
let
us
go
back
to
my
poor
little
petition
oh
do
make
me
useful
there
are
so
many
things
i
can
do
you
will
find
me
a
treasure
in
the
house
i
write
a
good
hand
i
understand
polishing
furniture
i
can
dress
hair
look
at
my
own
hair
i
play
and
sing
a
little
when
people
want
to
be
amused
i
can
mix
a
salad
and
knit
stockings
who
is
this
the
cook
came
in
at
the
moment
to
consult
me
i
introduced
her
and
oh
cried
miss
jillgall
in
ecstasy
i
can
cook
do
please
let
me
see
the
the
cook
s
face
turned
red
she
had
come
to
me
to
make
a
confession
and
she
had
not
as
she
afterward
said
bargained
for
the
presence
of
a
stranger
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
took
the
liberty
of
whispering
to
me
i
must
ask
you
miss
to
let
me
send
up
the
cauliflower
plain
boiled
i
don
t
understand
the
directions
in
the
book
for
doing
it
in
the
foreign
miss
jillgall
s
ears
perhaps
because
they
are
so
large
possess
a
quickness
of
hearing
quite
unparalleled
in
my
experience
not
one
word
of
the
cook
s
whispered
confession
had
escaped
her
here
she
declared
is
an
opportunity
of
making
myself
useful
what
is
the
cook
s
name
hannah
take
me
downstairs
hannah
and
i
ll
show
you
how
to
do
the
cauliflower
in
the
foreign
way
she
seems
to
hesitate
is
it
possible
that
she
doesn
t
believe
me
listen
hannah
and
judge
for
yourself
if
i
am
deceiving
you
have
you
boiled
the
cauliflower
very
well
this
is
what
you
must
do
next
take
four
ounces
of
grated
cheese
two
ounces
of
best
butter
the
yolks
of
four
eggs
a
little
bit
of
glaze
nutmeg
dear
dear
how
black
she
looks
what
have
i
said
to
offend
her
the
cook
passed
over
the
lady
who
had
presumed
to
instruct
her
as
if
no
such
person
had
been
present
and
addressed
herself
to
me
if
i
am
to
be
interfered
with
in
my
own
kitchen
miss
i
will
ask
you
to
suit
yourself
at
a
month
s
miss
jillgall
wrung
her
hands
in
despair
i
meant
so
kindly
she
said
and
i
seem
to
have
made
mischief
with
the
best
intentions
helena
i
have
set
you
and
your
servant
at
variance
i
really
didn
t
know
you
had
such
a
temper
hannah
she
declared
following
the
cook
to
the
door
i
m
sure
there
s
nothing
i
am
not
ready
to
do
to
make
it
up
with
you
perhaps
you
have
not
got
the
cheese
downstairs
i
m
ready
to
go
out
and
buy
it
for
you
i
could
show
you
how
to
keep
eggs
sweet
and
fresh
for
weeks
together
your
gown
doesn
t
fit
very
well
i
shall
be
glad
to
improve
it
if
you
will
leave
it
out
for
me
after
you
have
gone
to
bed
there
cried
miss
jillgall
as
the
cook
majestically
left
the
room
without
even
looking
at
her
i
have
done
my
best
to
make
it
up
and
you
see
how
my
advances
are
received
what
more
could
i
have
done
i
really
ask
you
dear
as
a
friend
what
more
i
have
done
i
had
it
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
to
say
the
cook
doesn
t
ask
you
to
buy
cheese
for
her
or
to
teach
her
how
to
keep
eggs
or
to
improve
the
fit
of
her
gown
all
she
wants
is
to
have
her
kitchen
to
but
here
again
it
was
necessary
to
remember
that
this
odious
person
was
my
father
s
guest
pray
don
t
distress
yourself
i
began
i
am
sure
you
are
not
to
blame
miss
jillgall
oh
don
t
don
t
what
don
t
call
me
miss
jillgall
i
call
you
helena
call
me
i
had
really
not
supposed
it
possible
that
she
could
be
more
unendurable
than
ever
when
she
mentioned
her
christian
name
she
succeeded
nevertheless
in
producing
that
result
in
the
whole
list
of
women
s
names
is
there
any
one
to
be
found
so
absolutely
sickening
as
selina
i
forced
myself
to
pronounce
it
i
made
another
apology
i
said
english
servants
were
so
very
peculiar
selina
was
more
than
satisfied
she
was
quite
delighted
is
that
it
indeed
an
explanation
was
all
i
wanted
how
good
of
you
and
now
tell
me
is
there
no
chance
in
the
house
or
out
of
the
house
of
my
making
myself
useful
oh
what
s
that
do
i
see
a
chance
i
do
i
do
miss
jillgall
s
eyes
are
more
than
mortal
at
one
time
they
are
microscopes
at
another
time
they
are
telescopes
she
discovered
right
across
the
room
the
torn
place
in
the
in
an
instant
she
snatched
a
dirty
little
leather
case
out
of
her
pocket
threaded
her
needle
and
began
darning
the
curtain
she
sang
over
her
work
my
heart
is
light
my
will
is
free
i
can
repeat
no
more
of
it
when
i
heard
her
singing
voice
i
became
reckless
of
consequences
and
ran
out
of
the
room
with
my
hands
over
my
ears
chapter
xvi
helena
s
diary
when
i
reached
the
foot
of
the
stairs
my
father
called
me
into
his
study
i
found
him
at
his
with
such
a
heap
of
paper
in
his
that
it
overflowed
on
to
the
floor
he
explained
to
me
that
he
had
been
destroying
a
large
accumulation
of
old
letters
and
had
ended
when
his
employment
began
to
grow
wearisome
in
examining
his
correspondence
rather
carelessly
the
result
was
that
he
had
torn
up
a
letter
and
a
copy
of
the
reply
which
ought
to
have
been
set
aside
as
worthy
of
preservation
after
collecting
the
fragments
he
had
heaped
them
on
the
table
if
i
could
contrive
to
put
them
together
again
on
fair
sheets
of
paper
and
fasten
them
in
their
right
places
with
gum
i
should
be
doing
him
a
service
at
a
time
when
he
was
too
busy
to
set
his
mistake
right
for
himself
here
was
the
best
excuse
that
i
could
desire
for
keeping
out
of
miss
jillgall
s
way
i
cheerfully
set
to
work
on
the
restoration
of
the
letters
while
my
father
went
on
with
his
writing
having
put
the
fragments
together
excepting
a
few
gaps
caused
by
morsels
that
had
been
lost
i
was
unwilling
to
fasten
them
down
with
gum
until
i
could
feel
sure
of
not
having
made
any
mistakes
especially
in
regard
to
some
of
the
lost
words
which
i
had
been
obliged
to
restore
by
so
i
copied
the
letters
and
submitted
them
in
the
first
place
to
my
father
s
approval
he
praised
me
in
the
prettiest
manner
for
the
care
that
i
had
taken
but
when
he
began
after
some
hesitation
to
read
my
copy
i
noticed
a
change
the
smile
left
his
face
and
the
nervous
quiverings
showed
themselves
again
quite
right
my
child
he
said
in
low
sad
tones
on
returning
to
my
side
of
the
table
i
expected
to
see
him
resume
his
writing
he
crossed
the
room
to
the
window
and
stood
with
his
back
to
me
looking
out
when
i
had
first
discovered
the
sense
of
the
letters
they
failed
to
interest
me
a
tiresome
woman
presuming
on
the
kindness
of
a
man
to
beg
a
favor
which
she
had
no
right
to
ask
and
receiving
a
refusal
which
she
had
richly
deserved
was
no
remarkable
event
in
my
experience
as
my
father
s
secretary
and
copyist
but
the
change
in
his
face
while
he
read
the
correspondence
altered
my
opinion
of
the
letters
there
was
more
in
them
evidently
than
i
had
discovered
i
kept
my
manuscript
copy
here
it
is
from
miss
elizabeth

to
the
rev
abel
gracedieu

of

missing
dear
sir
you
have
i
hope
not
quite
forgotten
the
interesting
conversation
that
we
had
last
year
in
the
governor
s
rooms
i
am
afraid
i
spoke
a
little
flippantly
at
the
time
but
i
am
sure
you
will
believe
me
when
i
say
that
this
was
out
of
no
want
of
respect
to
yourself
my
pecuniary
position
being
far
from
prosperous
i
am
endeavoring
to
obtain
the
vacant
situation
of
housekeeper
in
a
public
institution
the
prospectus
of
which
i
inclose
you
will
see
it
is
a
rule
of
the
place
that
a
candidate
must
be
a
single
woman
which
i
am
and
must
be
recommended
by
a
clergyman
you
are
the
only
reverend
gentleman
whom
it
is
my
good
fortune
to
know
and
the
thing
is
of
course
a
mere
formality
pray
excuse
this
application
and
oblige
me
by
acting
as
my
reference
sincerely
yours
elizabeth
p
please
address
miss
chance
poste
restante
martin
from
the
rev
abel
gracedieu
to
miss
chance
copy
madam
the
brief
conversation
to
which
your
letter
alludes
took
place
at
an
accidental
meeting
between
us
i
then
saw
you
for
the
first
time
and
i
have
not
seen
you
since
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
assert
the
claim
of
a
perfect
stranger
like
yourself
to
fill
a
situation
of
trust
i
must
beg
to
decline
acting
as
your
reference
your
obedient
servant
abel
my
father
was
still
at
the
window
in
that
idle
position
he
could
hardly
complain
of
me
for
interrupting
him
if
i
ventured
to
talk
about
the
letters
which
i
had
put
together
if
my
curiosity
displeased
him
he
had
only
to
say
so
and
there
would
be
an
end
to
any
allusions
of
mine
to
the
subject
my
first
idea
was
to
join
him
at
the
window
on
reflection
and
still
perceiving
that
he
kept
his
back
turned
on
me
i
thought
it
might
be
more
prudent
to
remain
at
the
table
this
miss
chance
seems
to
be
an
impudent
person
i
said
was
she
a
young
woman
when
you
met
with
her
what
sort
of
a
woman
to
look
at
ugly
here
were
three
answers
which
eunice
herself
would
have
been
quick
enough
to
interpret
as
three
warnings
to
say
no
more
i
felt
a
little
hurt
by
his
keeping
his
back
turned
on
me
at
the
same
time
and
naturally
i
think
i
found
my
interest
in
miss
chance
i
don
t
say
my
friendly
interest
considerably
increased
by
my
father
s
unusually
rude
behavior
i
was
also
animated
by
an
irresistible
desire
to
make
him
turn
round
and
look
at
me
miss
chance
s
letter
was
written
many
years
ago
i
resumed
i
wonder
what
has
become
of
her
since
she
wrote
to
i
know
nothing
about
not
even
whether
she
is
alive
or
dead
not
even
that
what
do
these
questions
mean
helena
nothing
i
declare
he
looked
as
if
he
suspected
me
why
don
t
you
speak
out
he
said
have
i
ever
taught
you
to
conceal
your
thoughts
have
i
ever
been
a
hard
father
who
discouraged
you
when
you
wished
to
confide
in
him
what
are
you
thinking
about
do
know
anything
of
this
woman
oh
father
what
a
question
i
never
even
heard
of
her
till
i
put
the
torn
letters
together
i
begin
to
wish
you
had
not
asked
me
to
do
so
do
i
it
never
struck
me
that
you
would
feel
such
extraordinary
i
had
almost
said
such
vulgar
curiosity
about
a
worthless
this
roused
my
temper
when
a
young
lady
is
told
that
she
is
vulgar
if
she
has
any
i
mean
she
feels
insulted
i
said
something
sharp
in
my
turn
it
was
in
the
way
of
argument
i
do
not
know
how
it
may
be
with
other
young
persons
i
never
reason
so
well
myself
as
when
i
am
angry
you
call
it
a
worthless
letter
i
said
and
yet
you
think
it
worth
have
you
nothing
more
to
say
to
me
than
that
he
asked
nothing
more
i
answered
he
changed
again
after
having
looked
unaccountably
angry
he
now
looked
unaccountably
relieved
i
will
soon
satisfy
you
he
said
that
i
have
a
good
reason
for
preserving
a
worthless
letter
miss
chance
my
dear
is
not
a
woman
to
be
trusted
if
she
saw
her
advantage
in
making
a
bad
use
of
my
reply
i
am
afraid
she
would
not
hesitate
to
do
it
even
if
she
is
no
longer
living
i
don
t
know
into
what
vile
hands
my
letter
may
not
have
fallen
or
how
it
might
be
falsified
for
some
wicked
purpose
do
you
see
now
how
a
correspondence
may
become
accidentally
important
though
it
is
of
no
value
in
itself
i
could
say
yes
to
this
with
a
safe
conscience
but
there
were
some
perplexities
still
left
in
my
mind
it
seemed
strange
that
miss
chance
should
apparently
have
submitted
to
the
severity
of
my
father
s
reply
i
should
have
thought
i
said
to
him
that
she
would
have
sent
you
another
impudent
letter
or
perhaps
have
insisted
on
seeing
you
and
using
her
tongue
instead
of
her
she
could
do
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
helena
miss
chance
will
never
find
out
my
address
again
i
have
taken
good
care
of
he
spoke
in
a
loud
voice
with
a
flushed
face
as
if
it
was
quite
a
triumph
to
have
prevented
this
woman
from
discovering
his
address
what
reason
could
he
have
for
being
so
anxious
to
keep
her
away
from
him
could
i
venture
to
conclude
that
there
was
a
mystery
in
the
life
of
a
man
so
blameless
so
truly
pious
it
shocked
one
even
to
think
of
it
there
was
a
silence
between
us
to
which
the
housemaid
offered
a
welcome
interruption
dinner
was
ready
he
kissed
me
before
we
left
the
room
one
word
more
helena
he
said
and
i
have
done
let
there
be
no
more
talk
between
us
about
elizabeth
chapter
xvii
helena
s
diary
miss
jillgall
joined
us
at
the
in
a
state
of
excitement
carrying
a
book
in
her
hand
i
am
inclined
on
reflection
to
suspect
that
she
is
quite
clever
enough
to
have
discovered
that
i
hate
her
and
that
many
of
the
aggravating
things
she
says
and
does
are
assumed
out
of
retaliation
for
the
purpose
of
making
me
angry
that
ugly
face
is
a
double
face
or
i
am
much
mistaken
to
return
to
the
miss
jillgall
addressed
herself
with
an
air
of
playful
penitence
to
my
father
dear
cousin
i
hope
i
have
not
done
wrong
helena
left
me
all
by
myself
when
i
had
finished
darning
the
curtain
i
really
didn
t
know
what
to
do
so
i
opened
all
the
bedroom
doors
upstairs
and
looked
into
the
rooms
in
the
big
room
with
two
beds
oh
i
am
so
ashamed
i
found
this
book
please
look
at
the
first
my
father
looked
at
the
doctor
watts
s
hymns
well
selina
what
is
there
to
be
ashamed
of
in
this
oh
no
no
it
s
the
wrong
page
do
look
at
the
other
page
the
one
that
comes
first
before
that
my
patient
father
turned
to
the
blank
page
ah
he
said
quietly
my
other
daughter
s
name
is
written
in
it
the
daughter
whom
you
have
not
seen
well
miss
jillgall
clasped
her
hands
distractedly
it
s
my
ignorance
i
m
so
ashamed
of
dear
cousin
forgive
me
enlighten
me
i
don
t
know
how
to
pronounce
your
other
daughter
s
name
do
you
call
her
euneece
the
dinner
was
getting
cold
i
was
provoked
into
saying
no
we
don
she
had
evidently
not
forgiven
me
for
leaving
her
by
herself
pardon
me
helena
when
i
want
information
i
don
t
apply
to
you
i
sit
as
it
were
at
the
feet
of
your
learned
father
dear
cousin
is
it
even
my
father
declined
to
wait
for
his
dinner
any
longer
pronounce
it
as
you
like
selina
here
we
say
euni
ce
with
the
accent
on
the
i
and
with
the
final
e
sounded
let
me
give
you
some
miss
jillgall
groaned
oh
how
difficult
it
seems
to
be
quite
beyond
my
poor
brains
i
shall
ask
the
dear
girl
s
leave
to
call
her
euneece
what
very
strong
soup
isn
t
it
rather
a
waste
of
meat
give
me
a
little
more
i
discovered
another
of
miss
jillgall
s
peculiarities
her
appetite
was
enormous
and
her
ways
were
greedy
you
heard
her
eat
her
soup
she
devoured
the
food
on
her
plate
with
her
eyes
before
she
put
it
into
her
mouth
and
she
criticised
our
english
cookery
in
the
most
impudent
manner
under
pretense
of
asking
humbly
how
it
was
done
there
was
however
some
temporary
compensation
for
this
we
had
less
of
her
talk
while
she
was
eating
her
dinner
with
the
removal
of
the
cloth
she
recovered
the
use
of
her
tongue
and
she
hit
on
the
one
subject
of
all
others
which
proves
to
be
the
sorest
trial
to
my
father
s
patience
and
now
dear
cousin
let
us
talk
of
your
other
daughter
our
absent
euneece
i
do
so
long
to
see
her
when
is
she
coming
back
in
a
few
days
how
glad
i
am
and
do
tell
me
which
is
she
your
oldest
girl
or
your
youngest
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
oh
my
head
my
head
this
is
even
worse
than
the
accent
on
the
i
and
the
final
stop
i
am
cleverer
than
i
thought
i
was
you
mean
that
the
girls
are
twins
are
they
both
so
exactly
like
each
other
that
i
shan
t
know
which
is
which
what
fun
when
the
subject
of
our
ages
was
unluckily
started
at
staveley
s
i
had
slipped
out
of
the
difficulty
easily
by
assuming
the
character
of
the
eldest
sister
an
example
of
ready
tact
which
my
dear
stupid
eunice
doesn
t
understand
in
my
father
s
presence
it
is
needless
to
say
that
i
kept
silence
and
left
it
to
him
i
was
sorry
to
be
obliged
to
do
this
owing
to
his
sad
state
of
health
he
is
easily
irritated
especially
by
inquisitive
strangers
i
must
leave
you
he
answered
without
taking
the
slightest
notice
of
what
miss
jillgall
had
said
to
him
my
work
is
waiting
for
she
stopped
him
on
his
way
to
the
door
oh
tell
me
can
t
i
help
you
thank
you
well
but
tell
me
one
thing
am
i
right
about
the
twins
you
are
miss
jillgall
s
demonstrative
hands
flew
up
into
the
air
again
and
expressed
the
climax
of
astonishment
by
quivering
over
her
head
this
is
positively
maddening
she
declared
what
does
it
mean
take
my
advice
cousin
don
t
attempt
to
find
out
what
it
he
left
the
room
miss
jillgall
appealed
to
me
i
imitated
my
father
s
wise
brevity
of
expression
sorry
to
disappoint
you
selina
i
know
no
more
about
it
than
you
do
come
every
step
of
the
way
up
to
the
was
marked
by
a
protest
or
an
inquiry
did
i
expect
her
to
believe
that
i
couldn
t
say
which
of
us
was
the
elder
of
the
two
that
i
didn
t
really
know
what
my
father
s
motive
was
for
this
extraordinary
mystification
that
my
sister
and
i
had
submitted
to
be
robbed
as
it
were
of
our
own
ages
and
had
not
insisted
on
discovering
which
of
us
had
come
into
the
world
first
that
our
friends
had
not
put
an
end
to
this
sort
of
thing
by
comparing
us
personally
and
discovering
which
was
the
elder
sister
by
investigation
of
our
faces
to
all
this
i
replied
first
that
i
did
certainly
expect
her
to
believe
whatever
i
might
say
secondly
that
what
she
was
pleased
to
call
the
mystification
had
begun
when
we
were
both
children
that
habit
had
made
it
familiar
to
us
in
the
course
of
years
and
above
all
that
we
were
too
fond
of
our
good
father
to
ask
for
explanations
which
we
knew
by
experience
would
distress
him
thirdly
that
friends
did
try
to
discover
by
personal
examination
which
was
the
elder
sister
and
differed
perpetually
in
their
conclusions
also
that
we
had
amused
ourselves
by
trying
the
same
experiment
before
our
and
that
eunice
thought
helena
was
the
oldest
and
helena
thought
eunice
was
the
oldest
fourthly
and
finally
that
the
reverend
gracedieu
s
cousin
had
better
drop
the
subject
unless
she
was
bent
on
making
her
presence
in
the
house
unendurable
to
the
reverend
gracedieu
himself
i
write
it
with
a
sense
of
humiliation
miss
jillgall
listened
attentively
to
all
i
had
to
say
and
then
took
me
completely
by
surprise
this
inquisitive
meddlesome
restless
impudent
woman
suddenly
transformed
herself
into
a
perfect
model
of
amiability
and
decorum
she
actually
said
she
agreed
with
me
and
was
much
obliged
for
my
good
advice
a
stupid
young
woman
in
my
place
would
have
discovered
that
this
was
not
natural
and
that
miss
jillgall
was
presenting
herself
to
me
in
disguise
to
reach
some
secret
end
of
her
own
i
am
not
a
stupid
young
woman
i
ought
to
have
had
at
my
service
penetration
enough
to
see
through
and
through
cousin
selina
well
cousin
selina
was
an
impenetrable
mystery
to
me
the
one
thing
to
be
done
was
to
watch
her
i
was
at
least
sly
enough
to
take
up
a
book
and
pretend
to
be
reading
it
how
contemptible
she
looked
round
the
room
and
discovered
our
pretty
a
present
to
my
father
from
his
congregation
after
a
little
consideration
she
sat
down
to
write
a
letter
when
does
the
post
go
out
she
asked
i
mentioned
the
hour
and
she
began
her
letter
before
she
could
have
written
more
than
the
first
two
or
three
lines
she
turned
round
on
her
seat
and
began
talking
to
me
do
you
like
writing
letters
my
dear
yes
but
then
i
have
not
many
letters
to
only
a
few
friends
helena
but
those
few
worthy
to
be
loved
my
own
case
exactly
has
your
father
told
you
of
my
troubles
ah
i
am
glad
of
that
it
spares
me
the
sad
necessity
of
confessing
what
i
have
suffered
oh
how
good
my
friends
my
new
friends
were
to
me
in
that
dull
little
belgian
town
one
of
them
was
generosity
personified
ah
she
had
suffered
too
a
vile
husband
who
had
deceived
and
deserted
her
oh
the
men
when
she
heard
of
the
loss
of
my
little
fortune
that
noble
creature
got
up
a
subscription
for
me
and
went
round
herself
to
collect
think
of
what
i
owe
to
her
ought
i
to
let
another
day
pass
without
writing
to
my
benefactress
am
i
not
bound
in
gratitude
to
make
her
happy
in
the
knowledge
of
happiness
i
mean
the
refuge
opened
to
me
in
this
hospitable
house
she
twisted
herself
back
again
to
the
and
went
on
with
her
letter
i
have
not
attempted
to
conceal
my
stupidity
let
me
now
record
a
partial
recovery
of
my
intelligence
it
was
not
to
be
denied
that
miss
jillgall
had
discovered
a
good
reason
for
writing
to
her
friend
but
i
was
at
a
loss
to
understand
why
she
should
have
been
so
anxious
to
mention
the
reason
was
it
possible
after
the
talk
which
had
passed
between
us
that
she
had
something
mischievous
to
say
in
her
letter
relating
to
my
father
or
to
me
was
she
afraid
i
might
suspect
this
and
had
she
been
so
communicative
for
the
purpose
of
leading
my
suspicions
astray
these
were
vague
guesses
but
try
as
i
might
i
could
arrive
at
no
clearer
view
of
what
was
passing
in
miss
jillgall
s
mind
what
would
i
not
have
given
to
be
able
to
look
over
her
shoulder
without
discovery
she
finished
her
letter
and
put
the
address
and
closed
the
envelope
then
she
turned
round
toward
me
again
have
you
got
a
foreign
postage
stamp
dear
if
i
could
look
at
nothing
else
i
was
resolved
to
look
at
her
envelope
it
was
only
necessary
to
go
to
the
study
and
to
apply
to
my
father
i
returned
with
the
foreign
stamp
and
i
stuck
it
on
the
envelope
with
my
own
hand
there
was
nothing
to
interest
in
the
address
as
i
ought
to
have
foreseen
if
i
had
not
been
too
much
excited
for
the
exercise
of
a
little
common
sense
miss
jillgall

wonderful
friend

her
ugly
foreign

eunice
s
diary
here
i
am
writing
my
history
of
myself
once
more
by
my
own
bedside
some
unexpected
events
have
happened
while
i
have
been
away
one
of
them
is
the
absence
of
my
sister
helena
has
left
home
on
a
visit
to
a
northern
town
by
the
seaside
she
is
staying
in
the
house
of
a
minister
one
of
papa
s
friends
and
is
occupying
a
position
of
dignity
in
which
i
should
certainly
lose
my
head
the
minister
and
his
wife
and
daughters
propose
to
set
up
a
girls
scripture
class
on
the
plan
devised
by
papa
and
they
are
at
a
loss
poor
helpless
people
to
know
how
to
begin
helena
has
volunteered
to
set
the
thing
going
and
there
she
is
now
advising
everybody
governing
everybody
encouraging
everybody
issuing
directions
finding
fault
rewarding
merit
oh
dear
let
me
put
it
all
in
one
word
and
say
thoroughly
enjoying
herself
another
event
has
happened
relating
to
papa
it
so
distressed
me
that
i
even
forgot
to
think
of
philip
for
a
little
while
traveling
by
railway
i
suppose
because
i
am
not
used
to
it
gives
me
the
headache
when
i
got
to
our
station
here
i
thought
it
would
do
me
more
good
to
walk
home
than
to
ride
in
the
noisy
omnibus
between
the
railway
and
the
town
i
met
one
of
the
doctors
he
is
a
member
of
our
congregation
and
he
it
was
who
recommended
papa
some
time
since
to
give
up
his
work
as
a
minister
and
take
a
long
holiday
in
foreign
parts
i
am
glad
to
have
met
with
you
the
doctor
said
your
sister
i
find
is
away
on
a
visit
and
i
want
to
speak
to
one
of
you
about
your
it
seemed
that
he
had
been
observing
papa
in
chapel
from
what
he
called
his
own
medical
point
of
view
he
did
not
conceal
from
me
that
he
had
drawn
conclusions
which
made
him
feel
uneasy
it
may
be
anxiety
he
said
or
it
may
be
overwork
in
either
case
your
father
is
in
a
state
of
nervous
derangement
which
is
likely
to
lead
to
serious
results
unless
he
takes
the
advice
that
i
gave
him
when
he
last
consulted
me
there
must
be
no
more
hesitation
about
it
be
careful
not
to
irritate
him
but
remember
that
he
must
rest
you
and
your
sister
have
some
influence
over
him
he
won
t
listen
to
poor
dear
papa
i
did
see
a
change
in
him
for
the
worse
though
i
had
only
been
away
for
so
short
a
time
when
i
put
my
arms
round
his
neck
and
kissed
him
he
turned
pale
and
then
flushed
up
suddenly
the
tears
came
into
his
eyes
oh
it
was
hard
to
follow
the
doctor
s
advice
and
not
to
cry
too
but
i
succeeded
in
controlling
myself
i
sat
on
his
knee
and
made
him
tell
me
all
that
i
have
written
here
about
helena
this
led
to
our
talking
next
of
the
new
lady
who
is
to
live
with
us
as
a
member
of
the
family
i
began
to
feel
less
uneasy
at
the
prospect
of
being
introduced
to
this
stranger
when
i
heard
that
she
was
papa
s
cousin
and
when
he
mentioned
her
name
and
saw
how
it
amused
me
his
poor
worn
face
brightened
into
a
smile
go
and
find
her
he
said
and
introduce
yourself
i
want
to
hear
eunice
if
you
and
my
cousin
are
likely
to
get
on
well
the
servants
told
me
that
miss
jillgall
was
in
the
garden
i
searched
here
there
and
everywhere
and
failed
to
find
her
the
place
was
so
quiet
it
looked
so
deliciously
pure
and
bright
after
smoky
dreary
london
that
i
sat
down
at
the
further
end
of
the
garden
and
let
my
mind
take
me
back
to
philip
what
was
he
doing
at
that
moment
while
i
was
thinking
of
him
perhaps
he
was
in
the
company
of
other
young
ladies
who
drew
all
his
thoughts
away
to
themselves
or
perhaps
he
was
writing
to
his
father
in
ireland
and
saying
something
kindly
and
prettily
about
me
or
perhaps
he
was
looking
forward
as
anxiously
as
i
do
to
our
meeting
next
week
i
have
had
my
plans
and
i
have
changed
my
plans
on
the
railway
journey
i
thought
i
would
tell
papa
at
once
of
the
new
happiness
which
seems
to
have
put
a
new
life
into
me
it
would
have
been
delightful
to
make
my
confession
to
that
first
and
best
and
dearest
of
friends
but
my
meeting
with
the
doctor
spoiled
it
all
after
what
he
had
said
to
me
i
discovered
a
risk
if
i
ventured
to
tell
papa
that
my
heart
was
set
on
a
young
gentleman
who
was
a
stranger
to
him
could
i
be
sure
that
he
would
receive
my
confession
favorably
there
was
a
chance
that
it
might
irritate
him
and
the
fault
would
then
be
mine
of
doing
what
i
had
been
warned
to
avoid
it
might
be
safer
in
every
way
to
wait
till
philip
paid
his
visit
and
he
and
papa
had
been
introduced
to
each
other
and
charmed
with
each
other
could
helena
herself
have
arrived
at
a
wiser
conclusion
i
declare
i
felt
proud
of
my
own
discretion
in
this
enjoyable
frame
of
mind
i
was
disturbed
by
a
woman
s
voice
the
tone
was
a
tone
of
distress
and
the
words
reached
my
ears
from
the
end
of
the
garden
please
miss
let
me
a
shrubbery
marks
the
limit
of
our
little
bit
of
on
the
other
side
of
it
there
is
a
cottage
standing
on
the
edge
of
the
common
the
most
woman
in
the
world
lives
here
she
is
our
laundress
married
to
a
stupid
young
fellow
named
molly
and
blessed
with
a
plump
baby
as
at
herself
thinking
it
likely
that
the
piteous
voice
which
had
disturbed
me
might
be
the
voice
of
molly
i
was
astonished
to
hear
her
appealing
to
anybody
perhaps
to
me
to
let
her
so
i
passed
through
the
shrubbery
wondering
whether
the
gate
had
been
locked
during
my
absence
in
london
no
it
was
as
easy
to
open
as
ever
the
cottage
door
was
not
closed
i
saw
our
amiable
laundress
in
the
passage
on
her
knees
trying
to
open
an
inner
door
which
seemed
to
be
locked
she
had
her
eye
at
the
keyhole
and
once
again
she
called
out
please
miss
let
me
i
waited
to
see
if
the
door
would
be
opened
nothing
happened
i
waited
again
to
hear
if
some
person
inside
would
answer
nobody
spoke
but
somebody
or
something
made
a
sound
of
splashing
water
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
i
showed
myself
and
asked
what
was
the
matter
molly
looked
at
me
helplessly
she
said
miss
eunice
it
s
the
what
has
the
baby
done
i
inquired
molly
got
on
her
feet
and
whispered
in
my
ear
you
know
he
s
a
fine
child
well
miss
he
s
bewitched
a
what
lady
miss
the
very
person
i
had
been
trying
to
find
i
asked
where
she
was
the
laundress
pointed
dolefully
to
the
locked
door
in
and
where
is
your
baby
the
poor
woman
still
pointed
to
the
door
i
m
beginning
to
doubt
miss
whether
it
is
my
nonsense
molly
if
it
isn
t
yours
whose
baby
can
it
be
miss
jillgall
her
puzzled
face
made
this
singular
reply
more
funny
still
the
splashing
of
water
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
began
again
what
is
miss
jillgall
doing
now
i
said
washing
the
baby
miss
a
week
ago
she
came
in
here
one
morning
very
pleasant
and
kind
i
must
own
she
found
me
putting
on
the
baby
s
things
she
says
what
a
cherub
which
i
took
as
a
compliment
she
says
i
shall
call
again
she
called
again
so
early
that
she
found
the
baby
in
his
crib
you
be
a
good
soul
she
says
and
go
about
your
work
and
leave
the
child
to
i
says
yes
miss
but
please
to
wait
till
i
ve
made
him
fit
to
be
she
says
that
s
just
what
i
mean
to
do
i
stared
and
i
think
any
other
person
would
have
done
the
same
in
my
place
if
there
s
one
thing
more
than
another
i
enjoy
she
says
it
s
making
myself
useful
molly
i
ve
taken
a
fancy
to
your
she
says
and
i
mean
to
make
myself
useful
to
if
you
will
believe
me
miss
jillgall
has
only
let
me
have
one
opportunity
of
putting
my
own
child
tidy
she
was
late
this
morning
and
i
got
my
chance
and
had
the
boy
on
my
lap
drying
him
when
in
she
burst
like
a
blast
of
wind
and
snatched
the
baby
away
from
me
this
is
your
nasty
temper
she
says
i
declare
i
m
ashamed
of
you
and
there
she
is
with
the
door
locked
against
me
washing
the
child
all
over
again
herself
twice
i
ve
knocked
and
asked
her
to
let
me
in
and
can
t
even
get
an
answer
they
do
say
there
s
luck
in
odd
numbers
suppose
i
try
again
molly
knocked
and
the
proverb
proved
to
be
true
she
got
an
answer
from
miss
jillgall
at
last
if
you
don
t
be
quiet
and
go
away
you
shan
t
have
the
baby
back
at
who
could
help
it
i
burst
out
laughing
miss
jillgall
as
i
supposed
from
the
tone
of
her
voice
took
severe
notice
of
this
act
of
impropriety
who
s
that
laughing
she
called
out
give
yourself
a
i
gave
my
name
the
door
was
instantly
thrown
open
with
a
bang
papa
s
cousin
appeared
in
a
disheveled
state
with
splashes
of
soap
and
water
all
over
her
she
held
the
child
in
one
arm
and
she
threw
the
other
arm
round
my
neck
dearest
euneece
i
have
been
longing
to
see
you
how
do
you
like
our
baby
to
the
curious
story
of
my
introduction
to
miss
jillgall
i
ought
perhaps
to
add
that
i
have
got
to
be
friends
with
her
already
i
am
the
friend
of
anybody
who
amuses
me
what
will
helena
say
when
she
reads
this
chapter
xix
eunice
s
diary
when
people
are
interested
in
some
event
that
is
coming
do
they
find
the
dull
days
passed
in
waiting
for
it
days
which
they
are
not
able
to
remember
when
they
look
back
this
is
my
unfortunate
case
night
after
night
i
have
gone
to
bed
without
so
much
as
opening
my
journal
there
was
nothing
worth
writing
about
nothing
that
i
could
recollect
until
the
postman
came
i
ran
downstairs
when
i
heard
his
ring
at
the
bell
and
stopped
maria
on
her
way
to
the
study
there
among
papa
s
usual
handful
of
letters
was
a
letter
for
me
dear
miss
eunice
yours
ever
i
quote
the
passages
in
philip
s
letter
which
most
deeply
interested
me
i
am
his
dear
miss
and
he
is
mine
ever
truly
the
other
part
of
the
letter
told
me
that
he
had
been
detained
in
london
and
he
lamented
it
at
the
end
was
a
delightful
announcement
that
he
was
coming
to
me
by
the
afternoon
train
i
ran
upstairs
to
see
how
i
looked
in
the
glass
my
first
feeling
was
regret
for
the
thousandth
time
i
was
obliged
to
acknowledge
that
i
was
not
as
pretty
as
helena
but
this
passed
off
a
cheering
reflection
occurred
to
me
philip
would
not
have
found
in
my
sister
s
face
what
seems
to
have
interested
him
in
my
face
besides
there
is
my
figure
the
pity
of
it
is
that
i
am
so
ignorant
about
some
things
if
i
had
been
allowed
to
read
novels
i
might
judging
by
what
papa
said
against
them
in
one
of
his
sermons
have
felt
sure
of
my
own
attractions
i
might
even
have
understood
what
philip
really
thought
of
me
however
my
mind
was
quite
unexpectedly
set
at
ease
on
the
subject
of
my
figure
the
manner
in
which
it
happened
was
so
amusing
at
least
so
amusing
to
me
that
i
can
not
resist
mentioning
it
my
sister
and
i
are
forbidden
to
read
newspapers
as
well
as
novels
but
the
teachers
at
the
girls
scripture
class
are
too
old
to
be
treated
in
this
way
when
the
morning
lessons
were
over
one
of
them
was
reading
the
newspaper
to
the
other
in
the
empty
schoolroom
i
being
in
the
passage
outside
putting
on
my
cloak
it
was
a
report
of
an
application
made
to
the
magistrates
by
the
lady
of
his
worship
the
hearing
this
i
stopped
to
listen
the
lady
of
his
worship
what
a
funny
way
of
describing
a
man
s
wife
is
reported
to
be
a
little
too
fond
of
notoriety
and
to
like
hearing
the
sound
of
her
own
voice
on
public
occasions
but
this
is
only
my
writing
i
had
better
get
back
to
the
report
in
her
address
to
the
magistrates
the
mayoress
stated
that
she
had
seen
a
disgusting
photograph
in
the
shop
window
of
a
stationer
lately
established
in
the
town
she
desired
to
bring
this
person
within
reach
of
the
law
and
to
have
all
his
copies
of
the
shameless
photograph
destroyed
the
usher
of
the
court
was
thereupon
sent
to
purchase
the
on
second
thoughts
i
prefer
going
back
to
my
own
writing
again
it
is
so
uninteresting
to
copy
other
people
s
writing
two
of
the
magistrates
were
doing
justice
they
looked
at
the
photograph
and
what
did
it
represent
the
famous
statue
called
the
venus
de
medici
one
of
the
magistrates
took
this
discovery
indignantly
he
was
shocked
at
the
gross
ignorance
which
could
call
the
classic
ideal
of
beauty
and
grace
a
disgusting
work
the
other
one
made
polite
allowances
he
thought
the
lady
was
much
to
be
pitied
she
was
evidently
the
innocent
victim
of
a
neglected
education
mayor
left
the
court
in
a
rage
telling
the
justices
she
knew
where
to
get
law
i
shall
expose
venus
she
said
to
the
lord
when
the
scripture
class
had
broken
up
for
the
day
duty
ought
to
have
taken
me
home
curiosity
led
me
astray
i
mean
led
me
to
the
stationer
s
window
there
i
found
our
two
teachers
absorbed
in
the
photograph
having
got
to
the
shop
first
by
a
short
cut
they
seemed
to
think
i
had
taken
a
liberty
whom
i
joined
them
we
are
here
they
were
careful
to
explain
to
get
a
lesson
in
the
ideal
of
beauty
and
there
was
quite
a
little
crowd
of
townsfolk
collected
before
the
window
some
of
them
giggled
and
some
of
them
wondered
whether
it
was
taken
from
the
life
for
my
own
part
gratitude
to
venus
obliges
me
to
own
that
she
effected
a
great
improvement
in
the
state
of
my
mind
she
encouraged
me
if
that
stumpy
little
creature
with
no
waist
and
oh
such
uncertain
legs
represented
the
ideal
of
beauty
and
grace
i
had
reason
indeed
to
be
satisfied
with
my
own
figure
and
to
think
it
quite
possible
that
my
sweetheart
s
favorable
opinion
of
me
was
not
i
was
at
the
bedroom
window
when
the
time
approached
for
philip
s
arrival
quite
at
the
far
end
of
the
road
i
discovered
him
he
was
on
foot
he
walked
like
a
king
not
that
i
ever
saw
a
king
but
i
have
my
ideal
ah
what
a
smile
he
gave
me
when
i
made
him
look
up
by
waving
my
handkerchief
out
of
the
window
ask
for
papa
i
whispered
as
he
ascended
the
the
next
thing
to
do
was
to
wait
as
patiently
as
i
could
to
be
sent
for
downstairs
maria
came
to
me
in
a
state
of
excitement
oh
miss
what
a
handsome
young
gentleman
and
how
beautifully
dressed
is
he
instead
of
finishing
what
she
had
to
say
she
looked
at
me
with
a
sly
smile
i
looked
at
her
with
a
sly
smile
we
were
certainly
a
couple
of
fools
but
dear
me
how
happy
sometimes
a
fool
can
be
my
enjoyment
of
that
delightful
time
was
checked
when
i
went
into
the
i
had
expected
to
see
papa
s
face
made
beautiful
by
his
winning
smile
he
was
not
only
serious
he
actually
seemed
to
be
ill
at
ease
when
he
looked
at
me
at
the
same
time
i
saw
nothing
to
make
me
conclude
that
philip
had
produced
an
unfavorable
impression
the
truth
is
we
were
all
three
on
our
best
behavior
and
we
showed
it
philip
had
brought
with
him
a
letter
from
staveley
introducing
him
to
papa
we
spoke
of
the
staveleys
of
the
weather
of
the
cathedral
and
then
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
more
left
to
talk
about
in
the
silence
that
followed
what
a
dreadful
thing
silence
is
papa
was
sent
for
to
see
somebody
who
had
called
on
business
he
made
his
excuses
in
the
sweetest
manner
but
still
seriously
when
he
and
philip
had
shaken
hands
would
he
leave
us
together
no
he
waited
poor
philip
had
no
choice
but
to
take
leave
of
me
papa
then
went
out
by
the
door
that
led
into
his
study
and
i
was
left
alone
can
any
words
say
how
wretched
i
felt
i
had
hoped
so
much
from
that
first
meeting
and
where
were
my
hopes
now
a
profane
wish
that
i
had
never
been
born
was
finding
its
way
into
my
mind
when
the
door
of
the
room
was
opened
softly
from
the
side
of
the
passage
maria
dear
maria
the
best
friend
i
have
peeped
in
she
whispered
go
into
the
garden
miss
and
you
will
find
somebody
there
who
is
dying
to
see
you
mind
you
let
him
out
by
the
shrubbery
i
squeezed
her
hand
i
asked
if
she
had
tried
the
shrubbery
gate
with
a
sweetheart
of
her
own
hundreds
of
times
was
it
wrong
for
me
to
go
to
philip
in
the
garden
oh
there
is
no
end
to
objections
perhaps
i
did
it
it
was
wrong
perhaps
i
had
been
kept
on
my
best
behavior
too
long
for
human
endurance
how
sadly
disappointed
he
looked
and
how
rashly
he
had
placed
himself
just
where
he
could
be
seen
from
the
back
windows
i
took
his
arm
and
led
him
to
the
end
of
the
garden
there
we
were
out
of
the
reach
of
inquisitive
eyes
and
there
we
sat
down
together
under
the
big
mulberry
tree
oh
eunice
your
father
doesn
t
like
me
those
were
his
first
words
in
justice
to
papa
and
a
little
for
my
own
sake
too
i
told
him
he
was
quite
wrong
i
said
trust
my
father
s
goodness
trust
his
kindness
as
i
he
made
no
reply
his
silence
was
sufficiently
expressive
he
looked
at
me
fondly
i
may
be
wrong
but
fond
looks
surely
require
an
acknowledgment
of
some
kind
is
a
young
woman
guilty
of
boldness
who
only
follows
her
impulses
i
slipped
my
hand
into
his
hand
philip
seemed
to
like
it
we
returned
to
our
conversation
he
began
tell
me
dear
is
gracedieu
always
as
serious
as
he
is
oh
no
when
he
takes
exercise
does
he
ride
or
does
he
walk
papa
always
by
himself
sometimes
by
himself
sometimes
with
me
do
you
want
to
meet
him
when
he
goes
out
when
he
is
out
with
me
no
when
he
is
out
by
was
it
possible
to
tell
me
more
plainly
that
i
was
not
wanted
i
did
my
best
to
express
indignation
by
snatching
my
hand
away
from
him
he
was
completely
taken
by
surprise
eunice
don
t
you
understand
me
i
was
as
stupid
and
as
disagreeable
as
i
could
possibly
be
no
i
don
t
then
let
me
help
you
he
said
with
a
patience
which
i
had
not
deserved
up
to
that
moment
i
had
been
leaning
against
the
back
of
a
garden
chair
something
else
now
got
between
me
and
my
chair
it
stole
round
my
waist
it
held
me
gently
it
strengthened
its
hold
it
improved
my
temper
it
made
me
fit
to
understand
him
all
done
by
what
only
an
arm
philip
went
on
i
want
to
ask
your
father
to
do
me
the
greatest
of
all
favors
and
there
is
no
time
to
lose
every
day
i
expect
to
get
a
letter
which
may
recall
me
to
my
heart
sank
at
this
horrid
prospect
and
in
some
mysterious
way
my
head
must
have
felt
it
too
i
mean
that
i
found
my
head
resting
on
his
shoulder
he
went
on
how
am
i
to
get
my
opportunity
of
speaking
to
gracedieu
i
mustn
t
call
on
him
again
as
soon
as
or
next
day
but
i
might
meet
him
out
walking
alone
if
you
will
tell
me
how
to
do
it
a
note
to
my
hotel
is
all
i
want
don
t
tremble
my
sweet
if
you
are
not
present
at
the
time
do
you
see
any
objection
to
my
owning
to
your
father
that
i
love
you
i
felt
his
delicate
consideration
for
me
i
did
indeed
feel
it
gratefully
if
he
only
spoke
first
how
well
i
should
get
on
with
papa
afterward
the
prospect
before
me
was
exquisitely
encouraging
i
agreed
with
philip
in
everything
and
i
waited
how
eagerly
was
only
known
to
myself
to
hear
what
he
would
say
to
me
next
he
prophesied
next
when
i
have
told
your
father
that
i
love
you
he
will
expect
me
to
tell
him
something
else
can
you
guess
what
it
is
if
i
had
not
been
confused
perhaps
i
might
have
found
the
answer
to
this
as
it
was
i
left
him
to
reply
to
himself
he
did
it
in
words
which
i
shall
remember
as
long
as
i
live
dearest
eunice
when
your
father
has
heard
my
confession
he
will
suspect
that
there
is
another
confession
to
follow
it
he
will
want
to
know
if
you
love
me
my
angel
will
my
hopes
be
your
hopes
too
when
i
answer
him
what
there
was
in
this
to
make
my
heart
beat
so
violently
that
i
felt
as
if
i
was
being
stifled
is
more
than
i
can
tell
he
leaned
so
close
to
me
so
tenderly
so
delightfully
close
that
our
faces
nearly
touched
he
whispered
say
you
love
me
in
a
kiss
his
lips
touched
my
lips
pressed
them
dwelt
on
them
oh
how
can
i
tell
of
it
some
new
enchantment
of
feeling
ran
deliciously
through
and
through
me
i
forgot
my
own
self
i
only
knew
of
one
person
in
the
world
he
was
master
of
my
lips
he
was
master
of
my
heart
when
he
whispered
kiss
me
i
kissed
what
a
moment
it
was
a
faintness
stole
over
me
i
felt
as
if
i
was
going
to
die
some
exquisite
death
i
laid
myself
back
away
from
him
i
was
not
able
to
speak
there
was
no
need
for
it
my
thoughts
and
his
thoughts
were
one
he
knew
that
i
was
quite
overcome
he
saw
that
he
must
leave
me
to
recover
myself
alone
i
pointed
to
the
shrubbery
gate
we
took
one
long
last
look
at
each
other
for
that
day
the
trees
hid
him
i
was
left
by
myself
chapter
xx
eunice
s
diary
how
long
a
time
passed
before
my
composure
came
back
to
me
i
can
not
remember
now
it
seemed
as
if
i
was
waiting
through
some
interval
of
my
life
that
was
a
mystery
to
myself
i
was
content
to
wait
and
feel
the
light
evening
air
in
the
garden
wafting
happiness
over
me
and
all
this
had
come
from
a
kiss
i
can
call
the
time
to
mind
when
i
used
to
wonder
why
people
made
such
a
fuss
about
kissing
i
had
been
indebted
to
maria
for
my
first
taste
of
paradise
i
was
recalled
by
maria
to
the
world
that
i
had
been
accustomed
to
live
in
the
world
that
was
beginning
to
fade
away
in
my
memory
already
she
had
been
sent
to
the
garden
in
search
of
me
and
she
had
a
word
of
advice
to
offer
after
noticing
my
face
when
i
stepped
out
of
the
shadow
of
the
tree
try
to
look
more
like
yourself
miss
before
you
let
them
see
you
at
the
papa
and
miss
jillgall
were
sitting
together
talking
when
i
opened
the
door
they
left
off
when
they
saw
me
and
i
supposed
quite
correctly
as
it
turned
out
that
i
had
been
one
of
the
subjects
in
their
course
of
conversation
my
poor
father
seemed
to
be
sadly
anxious
and
out
of
sorts
miss
jillgall
if
i
had
been
in
the
humor
to
enjoy
it
would
have
been
more
amusing
than
ever
one
of
her
funny
little
eyes
persisted
in
winking
at
me
and
her
heavy
foot
had
something
to
say
to
my
foot
under
the
table
which
meant
a
great
deal
perhaps
but
which
only
succeeded
in
hurting
me
my
father
left
us
and
miss
jillgall
explained
herself
i
know
dearest
euneece
that
we
have
only
been
acquainted
for
a
day
or
two
and
that
i
ought
not
perhaps
to
have
expected
you
to
confide
in
me
so
soon
can
i
trust
you
not
to
betray
me
if
i
set
an
example
of
confidence
ah
i
see
i
can
trust
you
and
my
dear
i
do
so
enjoy
telling
secrets
to
a
friend
hush
your
father
your
excellent
father
has
been
talking
to
me
about
young
she
provokingly
stopped
there
i
entreated
her
to
go
on
she
invited
me
to
sit
on
her
knee
i
want
to
whisper
she
said
it
was
too
ridiculous
but
i
did
it
miss
jillgall
s
whisper
told
me
serious
news
the
minister
has
some
reason
euneece
for
disapproving
of
dunboyne
but
mind
this
i
don
t
think
he
has
a
bad
opinion
of
the
young
man
himself
he
is
going
to
return
dunboyne
s
call
oh
i
do
so
hate
formality
i
really
can
t
go
on
talking
of
dunboyne
tell
me
his
christian
name
ah
what
a
noble
name
how
i
long
to
be
useful
to
him
tomorrow
my
dear
after
the
one
o
clock
dinner
your
papa
will
call
on
philip
at
his
hotel
i
hope
he
won
t
be
out
just
at
the
wrong
i
resolved
to
prevent
that
unlucky
accident
by
writing
to
philip
if
miss
jillgall
would
have
allowed
it
i
should
have
begun
my
letter
at
once
but
she
had
more
to
say
and
she
was
stronger
than
i
was
and
still
kept
me
on
her
knee
it
all
looks
bright
enough
so
far
doesn
t
it
dear
sister
will
you
let
me
be
your
second
sister
i
do
so
love
you
euneece
thank
you
thank
you
but
the
gloomy
side
of
the
picture
is
to
come
next
the
minister
no
now
i
am
your
sister
i
must
call
him
papa
it
makes
me
feel
so
young
again
well
then
papa
has
asked
me
to
be
your
companion
whenever
you
go
out
euneece
is
too
young
and
too
attractive
to
be
walking
about
this
great
town
in
helena
s
absence
by
that
was
how
he
put
it
slyly
enough
if
one
may
say
so
of
so
good
a
man
and
he
used
your
sister
didn
t
he
as
a
kind
of
excuse
i
wish
your
sister
was
as
nice
as
you
are
however
the
point
is
why
am
i
to
be
your
companion
because
dear
child
you
and
your
young
gentleman
are
not
to
make
appointments
and
to
meet
each
other
alone
oh
yes
that
s
it
your
father
is
quite
willing
to
return
philip
s
call
he
proposes
as
a
matter
of
civility
to
staveley
to
ask
philip
to
dinner
but
mark
my
words
he
doesn
t
mean
to
let
philip
have
you
for
his
i
jumped
off
her
lap
it
was
horrible
to
hear
her
oh
i
said
you
be
right
about
it
miss
jillgall
jumped
up
too
she
has
foreign
ways
of
shrugging
her
shoulders
and
making
signs
with
her
hands
on
this
occasion
she
laid
both
hands
on
the
upper
part
of
her
dress
just
below
her
throat
and
mysteriously
shook
her
head
when
my
views
are
directed
by
my
affections
she
assured
me
i
never
see
wrong
my
bosom
is
my
strong
she
has
no
bosom
poor
soul
but
i
understood
what
she
meant
it
failed
to
have
any
soothing
effect
on
my
feelings
i
felt
grieved
and
angry
and
puzzled
all
in
one
miss
jillgall
stood
looking
at
me
with
her
hands
still
on
the
place
where
her
bosom
was
supposed
to
be
she
made
my
temper
hotter
than
ever
i
mean
to
marry
philip
i
said
certainly
my
dear
euneece
but
please
don
t
be
so
fierce
about
if
my
father
does
really
object
to
my
marriage
i
went
on
it
must
be
because
he
dislikes
philip
there
can
be
no
other
oh
yes
dear
there
what
is
the
reason
then
that
my
sweet
girl
is
one
of
the
things
that
we
have
got
to
find
the
post
of
this
morning
brought
a
letter
from
my
sister
we
were
to
expect
her
return
by
the
next
day
s
train
this
was
good
news
philip
and
i
might
stand
in
need
of
clever
helena
s
help
and
we
might
be
sure
of
getting
it
now
in
writing
to
philip
i
had
asked
him
to
let
me
hear
how
papa
and
he
had
got
on
at
the
hotel
i
won
t
say
how
often
i
consulted
my
watch
or
how
often
i
looked
out
of
the
window
for
a
man
with
a
letter
in
his
hand
it
will
be
better
to
get
on
at
once
to
the
discouraging
end
of
it
when
the
report
of
the
interview
reached
me
at
last
twice
philip
had
attempted
to
ask
for
my
hand
in
marriage
and
twice
my
father
had
deliberately
obstinately
philip
s
own
words
changed
the
subject
even
this
was
not
all
as
if
he
was
determined
to
show
that
miss
jillgall
was
perfectly
right
and
i
perfectly
wrong
papa
civil
to
philip
as
long
as
he
did
not
talk
of
me
had
asked
him
to
dine
with
us
and
philip
had
accepted
the
invitation
what
were
we
to
think
of
it
what
were
we
to
do
i
wrote
back
to
my
dear
love
so
cruelly
used
to
tell
him
that
helena
was
expected
to
return
on
the
next
day
and
that
her
opinion
would
be
of
the
greatest
value
to
both
of
us
in
a
postscript
i
mentioned
the
hour
at
which
we
were
going
to
the
station
to
meet
my
sister
when
i
say
we
i
mean
miss
jillgall
as
well
as
myself
we
found
him
waiting
for
us
at
the
railway
i
am
afraid
he
resented
papa
s
incomprehensible
resolution
not
to
give
him
a
hearing
he
was
silent
and
sullen
i
could
not
conceal
that
to
see
this
state
of
feeling
distressed
me
he
showed
how
truly
he
deserved
to
be
loved
he
begged
my
pardon
and
he
became
his
own
sweet
self
again
directly
i
am
more
determined
to
marry
him
than
ever
when
the
train
entered
the
station
all
the
carriages
were
full
i
went
one
way
thinking
i
had
seen
helena
miss
jillgall
went
the
other
way
under
the
same
impression
philip
was
a
little
way
behind
me
not
seeing
my
sister
i
had
just
turned
back
when
a
young
man
jumped
out
of
a
carriage
opposite
philip
and
recognized
and
shook
hands
with
him
i
was
just
near
enough
to
hear
the
stranger
say
look
at
the
girl
in
our
philip
looked
what
a
charming
creature
he
said
and
then
checked
himself
for
fear
the
young
lady
should
hear
him
she
had
just
handed
her
traveling
bag
and
wraps
to
a
porter
and
was
getting
out
philip
politely
offered
his
hand
to
help
her
she
looked
my
way
the
charming
creature
of
my
sweetheart
s
admiration
was
to
my
infinite
amusement

chapter
xxi
helena
s
diary
the
day
of
my
return
marks
an
occasion
which
i
am
not
likely
to
forget
hours
have
passed
since
i
came
home
and
my
agitation
still
forbids
the
thought
of
repose
as
i
sit
at
my
desk
i
see
eunice
in
bed
sleeping
peacefully
except
when
she
is
murmuring
enjoyment
in
some
happy
dream
to
what
end
has
my
sister
been
advancing
blindfold
and
who
knows
dragging
me
with
her
since
that
disastrous
visit
to
our
friends
in
london
strange
that
there
should
be
a
leaven
of
superstition
in
nature
strange
that
i
should
feel
fear
of
something
i
hardly
know
what
i
have
met
somewhere
perhaps
in
my
historical
reading
with
the
expression
a
chain
of
was
i
at
the
beginning
of
that
chain
when
i
entered
the
railway
carriage
on
my
journey
home
among
the
other
passengers
there
was
a
young
gentleman
accompanied
by
a
lady
who
proved
to
be
his
sister
they
were
both
people
the
brother
evidently
admired
me
and
did
his
best
to
make
himself
agreeable
time
passed
quickly
in
pleasant
talk
and
my
vanity
was
flattered
and
that
was
all
my
were
going
on
to
london
when
the
train
reached
our
station
the
young
lady
sent
her
brother
to
buy
some
fruit
which
she
saw
in
the
window
of
the
the
first
man
whom
he
encountered
on
the
platform
was
one
of
his
friends
to
whom
he
said
something
which
i
failed
to
hear
when
i
handed
my
traveling
bag
and
my
wraps
to
the
porter
and
showed
myself
at
the
carriage
door
i
heard
the
friend
say
what
a
charming
creature
having
nothing
to
conceal
in
a
journal
which
i
protect
by
a
lock
i
may
own
that
the
stranger
s
personal
appearance
struck
me
and
that
what
i
felt
this
time
was
not
flattered
vanity
but
gratified
pride
he
was
young
he
was
remarkably
handsome
he
was
a
man
all
this
happened
in
one
moment
in
the
moment
that
followed
i
found
myself
in
eunice
s
arms
that
odious
person
miss
jillgall
insisted
on
embracing
me
next
and
then
i
was
conscious
of
an
indescribable
feeling
of
surprise
eunice
presented
the
gentleman
to
me
as
a
friend
of
hers
philip
dunboyne
i
had
the
honor
of
meeting
your
sister
he
said
in
london
at
staveley
s
he
went
on
to
speak
easily
and
gracefully
of
the
journey
i
had
taken
and
of
his
friend
who
had
been
my
and
he
attended
us
to
the
railway
omnibus
before
he
took
his
leave
i
observed
that
eunice
had
something
to
say
to
him
confidentially
before
they
parted
this
was
another
example
of
my
sister
s
childish
character
she
is
instantly
familiar
with
new
acquaintances
if
she
happens
to
like
them
i
anticipated
some
amusement
from
hearing
how
she
had
contrived
to
establish
confidential
relations
with
a
man
like
dunboyne
but
while
miss
jillgall
was
with
us
it
was
just
as
well
to
keep
within
the
limits
of
commonplace
conversation
before
we
got
out
of
the
omnibus
i
had
however
observed
one
undesirable
result
of
my
absence
from
home
eunice
and
miss
jillgall
the
latter
having
no
doubt
finely
flattered
the
former
appeared
to
have
taken
a
strong
liking
to
each
other
two
curious
circumstances
also
caught
my
attention
i
saw
a
change
to
what
i
call
in
my
sister
s
manner
something
seemed
to
have
raised
her
in
her
own
estimation
then
again
miss
jillgall
was
not
like
her
customary
self
she
had
delightful
moments
of
silence
and
when
eunice
asked
how
i
liked
dunboyne
she
listened
to
my
reply
with
an
appearance
of
interest
in
her
ugly
face
which
was
quite
a
new
revelation
in
my
experience
of
my
father
s
cousin
these
little
discoveries
after
what
i
had
already
observed
at
the
ought
perhaps
to
have
prepared
me
for
what
was
to
come
when
my
sister
and
i
were
alone
in
our
room
but
eunice
whether
she
meant
to
do
it
or
not
baffled
my
customary
penetration
she
looked
as
if
she
had
plenty
of
news
to
tell
me
with
some
obstacle
in
the
way
of
doing
it
which
appeared
to
amuse
instead
of
annoying
her
if
there
is
one
thing
more
than
another
that
i
hate
it
is
being
puzzled
i
asked
at
once
if
anything
remarkable
had
happened
during
eunice
s
visit
to
london
she
smiled
mischievously
i
have
got
a
delicious
surprise
for
you
my
dear
and
i
do
so
enjoy
prolonging
it
tell
me
helena
what
did
you
propose
we
should
both
do
when
we
found
ourselves
at
home
again
my
memory
was
at
fault
eunice
s
good
spirits
became
absolutely
boisterous
she
called
out
catch
and
tossed
her
journal
into
my
hands
across
the
whole
length
of
the
room
we
were
to
read
each
other
s
diaries
she
said
there
is
mine
to
begin
innocent
of
any
suspicion
of
the
true
state
of
affairs
i
began
the
reading
of
eunice
s
journal
if
i
had
not
seen
the
familiar
handwriting
nothing
would
have
induced
me
to
believe
that
a
girl
brought
up
in
a
pious
household
the
daughter
of
a
distinguished
congregational
minister
could
have
written
that
shameless
record
of
passions
unknown
to
young
ladies
in
respectable
english
life
what
to
say
what
to
do
when
i
had
closed
the
book
was
more
than
i
felt
myself
equal
to
decide
my
wretched
sister
spared
me
the
anxiety
which
i
might
otherwise
have
felt
it
was
she
who
first
opened
her
lips
after
the
silence
that
had
fallen
on
us
while
i
was
reading
these
were
literally
the
words
that
she
said
my
darling
why
don
t
you
congratulate
me
no
argument
could
have
persuaded
me
as
this
persuaded
me
that
all
sisterly
remonstrance
on
my
part
would
be
completely
thrown
away
my
dear
eunice
i
said
let
me
beg
you
to
excuse
me
i
am
waiting
there
she
interrupted
me
and
oh
in
what
an
impudent
manner
she
took
my
chin
between
her
finger
and
thumb
and
lifted
my
downcast
face
and
looked
at
me
with
an
appearance
of
eager
expectation
which
i
was
quite
at
a
loss
to
understand
you
have
been
away
from
home
too
she
said
do
i
see
in
this
serious
face
some
astonishing
news
waiting
to
overpower
me
have
found
a
sweetheart
are
engaged
to
be
married
i
only
put
her
hand
away
from
me
and
advised
her
to
return
to
her
chair
this
perfectly
harmless
proceeding
seemed
absolutely
to
frighten
her
oh
my
dear
she
burst
out
surely
you
are
not
jealous
of
me
there
was
but
one
possible
reply
to
this
i
laughed
at
it
is
eunice
s
head
turned
she
kissed
me
now
you
laugh
she
said
i
begin
to
understand
you
again
i
ought
to
have
known
that
you
are
superior
to
jealousy
but
do
tell
me
would
it
be
so
very
wonderful
if
other
girls
found
something
to
envy
in
my
good
luck
just
think
of
it
such
a
handsome
man
such
an
agreeable
man
such
a
clever
man
such
a
rich
man
and
not
the
least
of
his
merits
a
man
who
admires
you
come
if
you
won
t
congratulate
me
congratulate
yourself
on
having
such
a
in
prospect
her
head
turned
i
drew
the
poor
soul
s
attention
compassionately
to
what
i
had
said
a
moment
since
pardon
me
dear
for
reminding
you
that
i
have
not
yet
refused
to
offer
my
congratulations
i
only
told
you
i
was
for
what
waiting
of
course
to
hear
what
my
father
thinks
of
your
wonderful
good
this
explanation
offered
with
the
kindest
intentions
produced
another
change
in
my
very
variable
sister
i
had
extinguished
her
good
spirits
as
i
might
have
extinguished
a
light
she
sat
down
by
me
and
sighed
in
the
saddest
manner
the
heart
must
be
hard
indeed
which
can
resist
the
distress
of
a
person
who
is
dear
to
us
i
put
my
arm
round
her
she
was
becoming
once
more
the
eunice
whom
i
so
dearly
loved
my
poor
child
i
said
don
t
distress
yourself
by
speaking
of
it
i
understand
your
father
objects
to
your
marrying
she
shook
her
head
i
can
t
exactly
say
helena
that
papa
does
that
he
only
behaves
very
am
i
indiscreet
dear
if
i
ask
in
what
way
father
s
behavior
has
surprised
you
she
was
quite
willing
to
enlighten
me
it
was
a
simple
little
story
which
to
my
mind
sufficiently
explained
the
strange
behavior
that
had
puzzled
my
unfortunate
sister
there
could
indeed
be
no
doubt
that
my
father
considered
eunice
far
too
childish
in
character
as
yet
to
undertake
the
duties
of
matrimony
but
with
his
customary
delicacy
and
dread
of
causing
distress
to
others
he
had
deferred
the
disagreeable
duty
of
communicating
his
opinion
to
dunboyne
the
adverse
decision
must
however
be
sooner
or
later
announced
and
he
had
arranged
to
inflict
disappointment
as
tenderly
as
might
be
at
his
own
table
considerately
leaving
eunice
in
the
enjoyment
of
any
vain
hopes
which
she
may
have
founded
on
the
event
of
the
i
passed
the
evening
until
came
in
the
study
with
my
father
our
talk
was
mainly
devoted
to
the
worthy
people
with
whom
i
had
been
staying
and
whose
new
schools
i
had
helped
to
found
not
a
word
was
said
relating
to
my
sister
or
to
dunboyne
poor
father
looked
so
sadly
weary
and
ill
that
i
ventured
after
what
the
doctor
had
said
to
eunice
to
hint
at
the
value
of
rest
and
change
of
scene
to
an
overworked
man
oh
dear
me
he
frowned
and
waved
the
subject
away
from
him
impatiently
with
a
wan
pale
hand
after
supper
i
made
an
unpleasant
discovery
not
having
completely
finished
the
unpacking
of
my
boxes
i
left
miss
jillgall
and
eunice
in
the
and
went
upstairs
in
half
an
hour
i
returned
and
found
the
room
empty
what
had
become
of
them
it
was
a
fine
moonlight
night
i
stepped
into
the
back
and
looked
out
of
the
window
there
they
were
walking
with
their
heads
close
together
deep
in
talk
with
my
knowledge
of
miss
jillgall
i
call
this
a
bad
sign
an
odd
thought
has
just
come
to
me
i
wonder
what
might
have
happened
if
i
had
been
visiting
at
staveley
s
instead
of
eunice
and
if
dunboyne
had
seen
me
first
absurd
if
i
was
not
too
tired
to
do
anything
more
those
last
lines
should
be
scratched
out
chapter
xxii
eunice
s
diary
i
said
so
to
miss
jillgall
and
i
say
it
again
here
nothing
will
induce
me
to
think
ill
of
helena
my
sister
is
a
good
deal
tired
and
a
little
out
of
temper
after
the
railway
journey
this
is
exactly
what
happened
to
me
when
i
went
to
london
i
attribute
her
refusal
to
let
me
read
her
journal
after
she
had
read
mine
entirely
to
the
disagreeable
consequences
of
traveling
by
railway
miss
jillgall
accounted
for
it
otherwise
in
her
own
funny
manner
my
sweet
child
your
sister
s
diary
is
full
of
abuse
of
poor
i
humored
the
joke
dearest
selina
keep
a
diary
of
your
own
and
fill
it
with
abuse
of
my
this
seemed
to
be
a
droll
saying
at
the
time
but
it
doesn
t
look
particularly
amusing
now
it
is
written
down
we
had
ginger
wine
at
supper
to
celebrate
helena
s
return
although
i
only
drank
one
glass
i
daresay
it
may
have
got
into
my
head
however
that
may
be
when
the
lovely
moonlight
tempted
us
into
the
garden
there
was
an
end
to
our
jokes
we
had
something
to
talk
about
which
still
dwells
disagreeably
on
my
mind
miss
jillgall
began
it
if
i
trust
you
dearest
euneece
with
my
own
precious
secrets
shall
i
never
never
never
live
to
repent
it
i
told
my
good
little
friend
that
she
might
depend
on
me
provided
her
secrets
did
no
harm
to
any
person
whom
i
loved
she
clasped
her
hands
and
looked
up
at
the
moon
i
can
only
suppose
that
her
sentiments
overpowered
her
she
said
very
prettily
that
her
heart
and
my
heart
beat
together
in
heavenly
harmony
it
is
needless
to
add
that
this
satisfied
me
miss
jillgall
s
generous
confidence
in
my
discretion
was
i
am
afraid
not
rewarded
as
it
ought
to
have
been
i
found
her
tiresome
at
first
she
spoke
of
an
excellent
friend
a
lady
who
had
helped
her
at
the
time
when
she
lost
her
little
fortune
by
raising
a
subscription
privately
to
pay
the
expenses
of
her
return
to
england
her
friend
s
name
not
very
attractive
to
english
ears
was
tenbruggen
they
had
first
become
acquainted
under
interesting
circumstances
miss
jillgall
happened
to
mention
that
my
father
was
her
only
living
relative
and
it
turned
out
that
tenbruggen
was
familiar
with
his
name
and
reverenced
his
fame
as
a
preacher
when
he
had
generously
received
his
poor
helpless
cousin
under
his
own
roof
miss
jillgall
s
gratitude
and
sense
of
duty
impelled
her
to
write
and
tell
tenbruggen
how
happy
she
was
as
a
member
of
our
family
let
me
confess
that
i
began
to
listen
more
attentively
when
the
narrative
reached
this
point
i
drew
a
little
picture
of
our
domestic
circle
here
miss
jillgall
said
describing
her
letter
and
i
mentioned
the
mystery
in
which
gracedieu
conceals
the
ages
of
you
two
dear
girls
tenbruggen
shall
we
shorten
her
ugly
name
and
call
her
very
well
is
a
remarkably
clever
woman
and
i
looked
for
interesting
results
if
she
would
give
her
opinion
of
the
mysterious
circumstance
mentioned
in
my
by
this
time
i
was
all
eagerness
to
hear
more
has
she
written
to
you
i
asked
miss
jillgall
looked
at
me
affectionately
and
took
the
reply
out
of
her
pocket
listen
euneece
and
you
shall
hear
her
own
words
thus
she
writes
your
letter
dear
selina
especially
interests
me
by
what
it
says
about
the
miss
gracedieus
look
dear
she
underlines
the
word
two
why
i
can
t
explain
can
you
ah
i
thought
not
well
let
us
get
back
to
the
letter
my
accomplished
friend
continues
in
these
terms
i
can
understand
the
surprise
which
you
have
felt
at
the
strange
course
taken
by
their
father
as
a
means
of
concealing
the
difference
which
there
must
be
in
the
ages
of
these
young
ladies
many
years
since
i
happened
to
discover
a
romantic
incident
in
the
life
of
your
popular
preacher
which
he
has
his
reasons
as
i
suspect
for
keeping
strictly
to
himself
if
i
may
venture
on
a
bold
guess
i
should
say
that
any
person
who
could
discover
which
was
the
oldest
of
the
two
daughters
would
be
also
likely
to
discover
the
true
nature
of
the
romance
in
gracedieu
s
isn
t
that
very
remarkable
euneece
you
don
t
seem
to
see
it
you
funny
child
pray
pay
particular
attention
to
what
comes
next
these
are
the
closing
sentences
in
my
friend
s
letter
if
you
find
anything
new
to
tell
me
which
relates
to
this
interesting
subject
direct
your
letter
as
before
provided
you
write
within
a
week
from
the
present
time
afterward
my
letters
will
be
received
by
the
english
physician
whose
card
i
inclose
you
will
be
pleased
to
hear
that
my
professional
interests
call
me
to
london
at
the
earliest
moment
that
i
can
there
dear
child
the
letter
comes
to
an
end
i
daresay
you
wonder
what
means
when
she
alludes
to
her
professional
interests
no
i
was
not
wondering
about
anything
it
hurt
me
to
hear
of
a
strange
woman
exercising
her
ingenuity
in
guessing
at
mysteries
in
papa
s
life
but
miss
jillgall
was
too
eagerly
bent
on
setting
forth
the
merits
of
her
friend
to
notice
this
i
now
heard
that
s
marriage
had
turned
out
badly
and
that
she
had
been
reduced
to
earn
her
own
bread
her
manner
of
doing
this
was
something
quite
new
to
me
she
went
about
from
one
place
to
another
curing
people
of
all
sorts
of
painful
maladies
by
a
way
she
had
of
rubbing
them
with
her
hands
in
belgium
she
was
called
a
when
i
asked
what
this
meant
in
english
i
was
told
medical
rubber
and
that
the
fame
of
s
wonderful
cures
had
reached
some
of
the
medical
newspapers
published
in
london
after
listening
i
must
say
for
myself
very
patiently
i
was
bold
enough
to
own
that
my
interest
in
what
i
had
just
heard
was
not
quite
so
plain
to
me
as
i
could
have
wished
it
to
be
miss
jillgall
looked
shocked
at
my
stupidity
she
reminded
me
that
there
was
a
mystery
in
tenbruggen
s
letter
and
a
mystery
in
papa
s
strange
conduct
toward
philip
put
two
and
two
together
darling
she
said
and
one
of
these
days
they
may
make
if
this
meant
anything
it
meant
that
the
reason
which
made
papa
keep
helena
s
age
and
my
age
unknown
to
everybody
but
himself
was
also
the
reason
why
he
seemed
to
be
so
strangely
unwilling
to
let
me
be
philip
s
wife
i
really
could
not
endure
to
take
such
a
view
of
it
as
that
and
begged
miss
jillgall
to
drop
the
subject
she
was
as
kind
as
ever
with
all
my
heart
dear
but
don
t
deceive
yourself
the
subject
will
turn
up
again
when
we
least
expect
chapter
xxiii
eunice
s
diary
only
two
days
now
before
we
give
our
little
and
philip
finds
his
opportunity
of
speaking
to
papa
oh
how
i
wish
that
day
had
come
and
gone
i
try
not
to
take
gloomy
views
of
things
but
i
am
not
quite
so
happy
as
i
had
expected
to
be
when
my
dear
was
in
the
same
town
with
me
if
papa
had
encouraged
him
to
call
again
we
might
have
had
some
precious
time
to
ourselves
as
it
is
we
can
only
meet
in
the
different
in
the
town
with
helena
on
one
side
and
miss
jillgall
on
the
other
to
take
care
of
us
i
do
call
it
cruel
not
to
let
two
young
people
love
each
other
without
setting
third
persons
to
watch
them
if
i
was
queen
of
england
i
would
have
pretty
private
bowers
made
for
lovers
in
the
summer
and
nice
warm
little
rooms
to
hold
two
in
the
winter
why
not
what
harm
could
come
of
it
i
should
like
to
know
the
cathedral
is
the
place
of
meeting
which
we
find
most
convenient
under
the
circumstances
there
are
delightful
nooks
and
corners
about
this
celebrated
building
in
which
lovers
can
lag
behind
if
we
had
been
in
papa
s
chapel
i
should
have
hesitated
to
turn
it
to
such
a
profane
use
as
this
the
cathedral
doesn
t
so
much
matter
shall
i
own
that
i
felt
my
inferiority
to
helena
a
little
keenly
she
could
tell
philip
so
many
things
that
i
should
have
liked
to
tell
him
first
my
clever
sister
taught
him
how
to
pronounce
the
name
of
the
bishop
who
began
building
the
cathedral
she
led
him
over
the
crypt
and
told
him
how
old
it
was
he
was
interested
in
the
crypt
he
talked
to
helena
not
to
me
of
his
ambition
to
write
a
work
on
cathedral
architecture
in
england
he
made
a
rough
little
sketch
in
his
book
of
our
famous
tomb
of
some
king
helena
knew
the
late
royal
personage
s
name
and
philip
showed
his
sketch
to
her
before
he
showed
it
to
me
how
can
i
blame
him
when
i
stood
there
the
picture
of
stupidity
trying
to
recollect
something
that
i
might
tell
him
if
it
was
only
the
dean
s
name
helena
might
have
whispered
it
to
me
i
think
she
remembered
it
not
i
and
mentioned
it
to
philip
of
course
i
kept
close
by
him
all
the
time
and
now
and
then
he
gave
me
a
look
which
raised
my
spirits
he
might
have
given
me
something
better
than
that
i
mean
a
kiss
when
we
had
left
the
cathedral
and
were
by
ourselves
for
a
moment
in
a
corner
of
the
dean
s
garden
but
he
missed
the
opportunity
perhaps
he
was
afraid
of
the
dean
himself
coming
that
way
and
happening
to
see
us
however
i
am
far
from
thinking
the
worse
of
philip
i
gave
his
arm
a
little
squeeze
and
that
was
better
than
nothing
he
and
i
took
a
walk
along
the
bank
of
the
river
my
sister
and
miss
jillgall
looking
after
us
as
usual
on
our
way
through
the
town
helena
stopped
to
give
an
order
at
a
shop
she
asked
us
to
wait
for
her
that
best
of
good
creatures
miss
jillgall
whispered
in
my
ear
go
on
by
yourselves
and
leave
me
to
wait
for
philip
interpreted
this
act
of
kindness
in
a
manner
which
would
have
vexed
me
if
i
had
not
understood
that
it
was
one
of
his
jokes
he
said
to
me
miss
jillgall
sees
a
chance
of
annoying
your
sister
and
enjoys
the
well
away
we
went
together
it
was
just
what
i
wanted
it
gave
me
an
opportunity
of
saying
something
to
philip
between
ourselves
i
could
now
beg
of
him
in
his
interests
and
mine
to
make
the
best
of
himself
when
he
came
to
dinner
clever
people
i
told
him
were
people
whom
papa
liked
and
admired
i
said
let
him
see
dear
how
clever
are
and
how
many
things
you
know
and
you
can
t
imagine
what
a
high
place
you
will
have
in
his
opinion
i
hope
you
don
t
think
i
am
taking
too
much
on
myself
in
telling
you
how
to
he
relieved
that
doubt
in
a
manner
which
i
despair
of
describing
his
eyes
rested
on
me
with
such
a
look
of
exquisite
sweetness
and
love
that
i
was
obliged
to
hold
by
his
arm
i
trembled
so
with
the
pleasure
of
feeling
it
i
do
sincerely
believe
he
said
that
you
are
the
most
innocent
girl
the
sweetest
truest
girl
that
ever
lived
i
wish
i
was
a
better
man
eunice
i
wish
i
was
good
enough
to
be
worthy
of
you
to
hear
him
speak
of
himself
in
that
way
jarred
on
me
if
such
words
had
fallen
from
any
other
man
s
lips
i
should
have
been
afraid
that
he
had
done
something
or
thought
something
of
which
he
had
reason
to
feel
ashamed
with
philip
this
was
impossible
he
was
eager
to
walk
on
rapidly
and
to
turn
a
corner
in
the
path
before
we
could
be
seen
i
want
to
be
alone
with
you
he
said
i
looked
back
we
were
too
late
helena
and
miss
jillgall
had
nearly
overtaken
us
my
sister
was
on
the
point
of
speaking
to
philip
when
she
seemed
to
change
her
mind
and
only
looked
at
him
instead
of
looking
at
her
in
return
he
kept
his
eyes
cast
down
and
drew
figures
on
the
pathway
with
his
stick
i
think
helena
was
out
of
temper
she
suddenly
turned
my
way
why
didn
t
you
wait
for
me
she
asked
philip
took
her
up
sharply
if
eunice
likes
seeing
the
river
better
than
waiting
in
the
street
he
said
isn
t
she
free
to
do
as
she
pleases
helena
said
nothing
more
philip
walked
on
slowly
by
himself
not
knowing
what
to
make
of
it
i
turned
to
miss
jillgall
surely
philip
can
t
have
quarreled
with
helena
i
said
miss
jillgall
answered
in
an
odd
manner
not
he
he
is
a
great
deal
more
likely
to
have
quarreled
with
why
suppose
you
ask
him
why
it
was
not
to
be
thought
of
it
would
have
looked
like
prying
into
his
thoughts
selina
i
said
there
is
something
odd
about
you
what
is
the
matter
i
don
t
understand
my
poor
dear
you
will
find
yourself
understanding
me
before
i
thought
i
saw
something
like
pity
in
her
face
when
she
said
that
my
poor
dear
i
repeated
what
makes
you
speak
to
me
in
that
way
i
don
t
know
i
m
tired
i
m
an
old
fool
i
ll
go
back
to
the
without
another
word
she
left
me
i
turned
to
look
for
philip
and
saw
that
my
sister
had
joined
him
while
i
had
been
speaking
to
miss
jillgall
it
pleased
me
to
find
that
they
were
talking
in
a
friendly
way
when
i
joined
them
a
quarrel
between
helena
and
my
husband
that
is
to
be
no
my
husband
that
be
would
have
been
too
distressing
too
unnatural
i
might
almost
call
it
philip
looked
along
the
backward
path
and
asked
what
had
become
of
miss
jillgall
have
you
any
objection
to
follow
her
example
he
said
to
me
when
i
told
him
that
selina
had
returned
to
the
town
i
don
t
care
for
the
banks
of
this
helena
who
used
to
like
the
river
at
other
times
was
as
ready
as
philip
to
leave
it
now
i
fancy
they
had
both
been
kindly
waiting
to
change
our
walk
till
i
came
to
them
and
they
could
study
my
wishes
too
of
course
i
was
ready
to
go
where
they
pleased
i
asked
philip
if
there
was
anything
he
would
like
to
see
when
we
got
into
the
streets
again
clever
helena
suggested
what
seemed
to
be
a
strange
amusement
to
offer
to
philip
let
s
take
him
to
the
girls
school
she
said
it
appeared
to
be
a
matter
of
perfect
indifference
to
him
he
was
what
they
call
ironical
oh
yes
of
course
deeply
interesting
deeply
interesting
he
suddenly
broke
into
the
wildest
good
spirits
and
tucked
my
hand
under
his
arm
with
a
gayety
which
it
was
impossible
to
resist
what
a
boy
you
are
helena
said
enjoying
his
delightful
hilarity
as
i
did
chapter
xxiv
eunice
s
diary
on
entering
the
schoolroom
we
lost
our
gayety
all
in
a
moment
something
unpleasant
had
evidently
happened
two
of
the
eldest
girls
were
sitting
together
in
a
corner
separated
from
the
rest
and
looking
most
wickedly
sulky
the
teachers
were
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
appearing
to
be
ill
at
ease
and
there
standing
in
the
midst
of
them
with
his
face
flushed
and
his
eyes
angry
there
was
papa
sadly
unlike
his
gentle
self
in
the
days
of
his
health
and
happiness
on
former
occasions
when
the
exercise
of
his
authority
was
required
in
the
school
his
forbearing
temper
always
set
things
right
when
i
saw
him
now
i
thought
of
what
the
doctor
had
said
of
his
health
on
my
way
home
from
the
station
papa
advanced
to
us
the
moment
we
showed
ourselves
at
the
door
he
shook
hands
cordially
shook
hands
with
philip
it
was
delightful
to
see
him
delightful
to
hear
him
say
pray
don
t
suppose
dunboyne
that
you
are
intruding
remain
with
us
by
all
means
if
you
then
he
spoke
to
helena
and
to
me
still
excited
still
not
like
himself
you
couldn
t
have
come
here
my
dears
at
a
time
when
your
presence
was
more
urgently
he
turned
to
the
teachers
tell
my
daughters
what
has
happened
tell
them
why
they
see
me
here
shocked
and
distressed
i
don
t
deny
we
now
heard
that
the
two
girls
in
disgrace
had
broken
the
rules
and
in
such
a
manner
as
to
deserve
severe
punishment
one
of
them
had
been
discovered
hiding
a
novel
in
her
desk
the
other
had
misbehaved
herself
more
seriously
still
she
had
gone
to
the
theater
instead
of
expressing
any
regret
they
had
actually
dared
to
complain
of
having
to
learn
papa
s
improved
catechism
they
had
even
accused
him
of
treating
them
with
severity
because
they
were
poor
girls
brought
up
on
charity
if
we
had
been
young
ladies
they
were
audacious
enough
to
say
more
indulgence
would
have
been
shown
to
us
we
should
have
been
allowed
to
read
stories
and
to
see
all
this
time
i
had
been
asking
myself
what
papa
meant
when
he
told
us
we
could
not
have
come
to
the
schoolroom
at
a
better
time
his
meaning
now
appeared
when
he
spoke
to
the
offending
girls
he
pointed
to
helena
and
to
me
here
are
my
daughters
he
said
you
will
not
deny
that
they
are
young
ladies
now
listen
they
shall
tell
you
themselves
whether
my
rules
make
any
difference
between
them
and
you
helena
eunice
do
i
allow
you
to
read
novels
do
i
allow
you
to
go
to
the
play
we
said
no
and
hoped
it
was
over
but
he
had
not
done
yet
he
turned
to
helena
answer
some
of
the
questions
he
went
on
from
my
manual
of
christian
obligation
which
the
girls
call
my
he
asked
one
of
the
questions
if
you
are
told
to
do
unto
others
as
you
would
they
should
do
unto
you
and
if
you
find
a
difficulty
in
obeying
that
divine
precept
what
does
your
duty
require
it
is
my
belief
that
helena
has
the
materials
in
her
for
making
another
joan
of
arc
she
rose
and
answered
without
the
slightest
sign
of
timidity
my
duty
requires
me
to
go
to
the
minister
and
to
seek
for
advice
and
and
if
these
fail
then
i
am
to
remember
that
my
pastor
is
my
friend
he
claims
no
priestly
authority
or
priestly
infallibility
he
is
my
who
loves
me
he
will
tell
me
how
he
has
himself
failed
how
he
has
struggled
against
himself
and
what
a
blessed
reward
has
followed
his
victory
a
purified
heart
a
peaceful
then
papa
released
my
sister
after
she
had
only
repeated
two
out
of
all
the
answers
in
christian
obligation
which
we
first
began
to
learn
when
we
were
children
he
then
addressed
himself
again
to
the
girls
is
what
you
have
just
heard
a
part
of
my
catechism
has
my
daughter
been
excused
from
repeating
it
because
she
is
a
young
lady
where
is
the
difference
between
the
religious
education
which
is
given
to
my
own
child
and
that
given
to
you
the
wretched
girls
still
sat
silent
and
obstinate
with
their
heads
down
i
tremble
again
as
i
write
of
what
happened
next
papa
fixed
his
eyes
on
me
he
said
out
loud
eunice
and
waited
for
me
to
rise
and
answer
as
my
sister
had
done
it
was
entirely
beyond
my
power
to
get
on
my
feet
philip
had
innocently
i
am
sure
discouraged
me
i
saw
displeasure
i
saw
contempt
in
his
face
there
was
a
dead
silence
in
the
room
everybody
looked
at
me
my
heart
beat
furiously
my
hands
turned
cold
the
questions
and
answers
in
christian
obligation
all
left
my
memory
together
i
looked
imploringly
at
papa
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
was
hard
on
me
his
eyes
were
as
angry
as
ever
they
showed
me
no
mercy
oh
what
had
come
to
me
what
evil
spirit
possessed
me
i
felt
resentment
horrid
undutiful
resentment
at
being
treated
in
this
cruel
way
my
fists
clinched
themselves
in
my
lap
my
face
felt
as
hot
as
fire
instead
of
asking
my
father
to
excuse
me
i
said
i
can
t
do
he
was
astounded
as
well
he
might
be
i
went
on
from
bad
to
worse
i
said
i
won
t
do
he
stooped
over
me
he
whispered
i
am
going
to
ask
you
something
i
insist
on
your
answering
yes
or
he
raised
his
voice
and
drew
himself
back
so
that
they
could
all
see
me
have
you
been
taught
like
your
sister
he
asked
has
the
catechism
that
has
been
her
religious
lesson
for
all
her
life
been
your
religious
lesson
for
all
your
life
too
i
said
yes
and
i
was
in
such
a
rage
that
i
said
it
out
loud
if
philip
had
handed
me
his
cane
and
had
advised
me
to
give
the
young
hussies
who
were
answerable
for
this
dreadful
state
of
things
a
good
beating
i
believe
i
should
have
done
it
papa
turned
his
back
on
me
and
offered
the
girls
a
last
chance
do
you
feel
sorry
for
what
you
have
done
do
you
ask
to
be
forgiven
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
answered
him
he
called
across
the
room
to
the
teachers
those
two
pupils
are
expelled
the
both
the
women
looked
horrified
the
elder
of
the
two
approached
him
and
tried
to
plead
for
a
milder
sentence
he
answered
in
one
stern
word
silence
and
left
the
schoolroom
without
even
a
passing
bow
to
philip
and
this
after
he
had
cordially
shaken
hands
with
my
poor
dear
not
half
an
hour
before
i
ought
to
have
made
affectionate
allowance
for
his
nervous
miseries
i
ought
to
have
run
after
him
and
begged
his
pardon
there
must
be
something
wrong
i
am
afraid
in
girls
loving
anybody
but
their
fathers
when
helena
led
the
way
out
by
another
door
i
ran
after
philip
and
i
asked
to
forgive
me
i
don
t
know
what
i
said
it
was
all
confusion
the
fear
of
having
forfeited
his
fondness
must
i
suppose
have
shaken
my
mind
i
remember
entreating
helena
to
say
a
kind
word
for
me
she
was
so
clever
she
had
behaved
so
well
she
had
deserved
that
philip
should
listen
to
her
oh
i
cried
out
to
him
desperately
what
must
you
think
of
me
i
will
tell
you
what
i
think
of
you
he
said
it
is
your
father
who
is
in
fault
eunice
not
you
nothing
could
have
been
in
worse
taste
than
his
management
of
that
trumpery
affair
in
the
schoolroom
it
was
a
complete
mistake
from
beginning
to
end
make
your
mind
easy
i
don
t
blame
are
you
really
and
truly
as
fond
of
me
as
ever
yes
to
be
sure
helena
seemed
to
be
hardly
as
much
interested
in
this
happy
ending
of
my
anxieties
as
i
might
have
anticipated
she
walked
on
by
herself
perhaps
she
was
thinking
of
poor
papa
s
strange
outbreak
of
excitement
and
grieving
over
it
we
had
only
a
little
way
to
walk
before
we
passed
the
door
of
philip
s
hotel
he
had
not
yet
received
the
expected
letter
from
his
father
the
cruel
letter
which
might
recall
him
to
ireland
it
was
then
the
hour
of
delivery
by
our
second
post
he
went
to
look
at
the
in
the
hall
helena
saw
that
i
was
anxious
she
was
as
kind
again
as
ever
she
consented
to
wait
with
me
for
philip
at
the
door
he
came
out
to
us
with
an
open
letter
in
his
hand
from
my
father
at
last
he
said
and
gave
me
the
letter
to
read
it
only
contained
these
few
lines
do
not
be
alarmed
my
dear
boy
at
the
change
for
the
worse
in
my
handwriting
i
am
suffering
for
my
devotion
to
the
studious
habits
of
a
lifetime
my
right
hand
is
attacked
by
the
malady
called
writer
s
cramp
the
doctor
here
can
do
nothing
he
tells
me
of
some
foreign
woman
mentioned
in
his
newspaper
who
cures
nervous
derangements
of
all
kinds
by
and
who
is
coming
to
london
when
you
next
hear
from
me
i
may
be
in
london
there
the
letter
ended
of
course
i
knew
who
the
foreign
woman
mentioned
in
the
newspaper
was
but
what
does
miss
jillgall
s
friend
matter
to
me
the
one
important
thing
is
that
philip
has
not
been
called
back
to
ireland
here
is
a
fortunate
circumstance
which
perhaps
means
more
good
luck
i
may
be
philip
dunboyne
before
the
year
is
out
chapter
xxv
helena
s
diary
they
all
notice
at
home
that
i
am
looking
worn
and
haggard
that
hideous
old
maid
miss
jillgall
had
her
malicious
welcome
ready
for
me
when
we
met
at
breakfast
this
morning
dear
helena
what
has
become
of
your
beauty
one
would
think
you
had
left
it
in
your
room
poor
deluded
eunice
showed
her
sisterly
sympathy
don
t
joke
about
it
selina
can
t
you
see
that
helena
is
ill
i
been
ill
ill
of
my
own
wickedness
but
the
recovery
to
my
tranquillity
will
bring
with
it
the
recovery
of
my
good
looks
my
fatal
passion
for
philip
promises
to
be
the
utter
destruction
of
everything
that
is
good
in
me
well
what
is
good
in
me
may
not
be
worth
keeping
there
is
a
fate
in
these
things
if
i
am
destined
to
rob
eunice
of
the
one
dear
object
of
her
love
and
hope
how
can
i
resist
the
one
kind
thing
i
can
do
is
to
keep
her
in
ignorance
of
what
is
coming
by
acts
of
affectionate
deceit
besides
if
she
suffers
i
suffer
too
in
the
length
and
breadth
of
england
i
doubt
if
there
is
a
much
more
wicked
young
woman
to
be
found
than
myself
is
it
nothing
to
feel
that
and
to
endure
it
as
i
do
upon
my
word
there
is
no
excuse
for
me
is
this
sheer
impudence
no
it
is
the
bent
of
my
nature
i
have
a
tendency
to
accompanied
by
one
merit
i
don
t
spare
myself
there
are
excuses
for
eunice
she
lives
in
a
fools
paradise
and
she
sees
in
her
lover
a
radiant
creature
shining
in
the
halo
thrown
over
him
by
her
own
nothing
of
this
sort
is
to
be
said
for
me
i
see
philip
as
he
is
my
penetration
looks
into
the
lowest
depths
of
his
character
when
i
am
not
in
his
company
there
seems
to
be
a
foundation
of
good
somewhere
in
his
nature
he
despises
and
hates
himself
he
has
confessed
it
to
me
when
eunice
is
with
him
still
believing
in
her
false
sweetheart
but
how
long
do
these
better
influences
last
i
have
only
to
show
myself
in
my
sister
s
absence
and
philip
is
mine
body
and
soul
his
vanity
and
his
weakness
take
possession
of
him
the
moment
he
sees
my
face
he
is
one
of
those
men
even
in
my
little
experience
i
have
met
with
them
who
are
born
to
be
led
by
women
if
eunice
had
possessed
my
strength
of
character
he
would
have
been
true
to
her
for
life
ought
i
not
in
justice
to
myself
to
have
lifted
my
heart
high
above
the
reach
of
such
a
creature
as
this
certainly
i
ought
i
know
it
i
feel
it
and
yet
there
is
some
fascination
in
having
him
which
i
am
absolutely
unable
to
resist
what
i
ask
myself
has
fed
the
new
flame
which
is
burning
in
me
did
it
begin
with
gratified
pride
i
might
well
feel
proud
when
i
found
myself
admired
by
a
man
of
his
beauty
set
off
by
such
manners
and
such
accomplishments
as
his
or
has
the
growth
of
this
masterful
feeling
been
encouraged
by
the
envy
and
jealousy
stirred
in
me
when
i
found
eunice
my
inferior
in
every
respect
distinguished
by
the
devotion
of
a
handsome
lover
and
having
a
brilliant
marriage
in
view
while
i
was
left
neglected
with
no
prospect
of
changing
my
title
from
miss
to
vain
inquiries
my
wicked
heart
seems
to
have
secrets
of
its
own
and
to
keep
them
a
mystery
to
me
what
has
become
of
my
excellent
education
i
don
t
care
to
inquire
i
have
got
beyond
the
reach
of
good
books
and
religious
examples
among
my
other
blamable
actions
there
may
now
be
reckoned
disobedience
to
my
father
i
have
been
reading
novels
in
secret
at
first
i
tried
some
of
the
famous
english
works
published
at
a
price
within
the
reach
of
small
purses
very
well
written
no
doubt
but
with
one
unpardonable
drawback
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
our
celebrated
native
authors
address
themselves
to
good
people
or
to
penitent
people
who
want
to
be
made
good
not
to
wicked
readers
like
me
arriving
at
this
conclusion
i
tried
another
experiment
in
a
small
bookseller
s
shop
i
discovered
some
cheap
translations
of
french
novels
here
i
found
what
i
wanted
sympathy
with
sin
here
there
was
opened
to
me
a
new
world
inhabited
entirely
by
unrepentant
people
the
magnificent
women
diabolically
beautiful
the
satanic
men
dead
to
every
sense
of
virtue
and
alive
perhaps
rather
dirtily
alive
to
the
splendid
fascinations
of
crime
i
know
now
that
love
is
above
everything
but
itself
love
is
the
one
law
that
we
are
bound
to
obey
how
deep
how
consoling
how
admirably
true
the
novelists
of
england
have
reason
indeed
to
hide
their
heads
before
the
novelists
of
france
all
that
i
have
felt
and
have
written
here
is
inspired
by
these
wonderful
authors
i
have
relieved
my
mind
and
may
now
return
to
the
business
of
my
diary
the
record
of
domestic
events
an
overwhelming
disappointment
has
fallen
on
eunice
our
has
been
put
off
the
state
of
father
s
health
is
answerable
for
this
change
in
our
arrangements
that
wretched
scene
at
the
school
complicated
by
my
sister
s
undutiful
behavior
at
the
time
so
seriously
excited
him
that
he
passed
a
sleepless
night
and
kept
his
bedroom
throughout
the
day
eunice
s
total
want
of
discretion
added
no
doubt
to
his
sufferings
she
rudely
intruded
on
him
to
express
her
regret
and
to
ask
his
pardon
having
carried
her
point
she
was
at
leisure
to
come
to
me
and
to
ask
how
amazingly
simple
of
her
what
she
and
philip
were
to
do
next
we
had
arranged
it
all
so
nicely
the
poor
wretch
began
philip
was
to
have
been
so
clever
and
agreeable
at
dinner
and
was
to
have
chosen
his
time
so
very
discreetly
that
papa
would
have
been
ready
to
listen
to
anything
he
said
oh
we
should
have
succeeded
i
haven
t
a
doubt
of
it
our
only
hope
helena
is
in
you
what
are
we
to
do
now
wait
i
answered
wait
she
repeated
hotly
is
my
heart
to
be
broken
and
what
is
more
cruel
still
is
philip
to
be
disappointed
i
expected
something
more
sensible
my
dear
from
you
what
possible
reason
can
there
be
for
waiting
the
reason
if
i
could
only
have
mentioned
it
was
beyond
dispute
i
wanted
time
to
quiet
philip
s
uneasy
conscience
and
to
harden
his
weak
mind
against
outbursts
of
violence
on
eunice
s
part
which
would
certainly
exhibit
themselves
when
she
found
that
she
had
lost
her
lover
and
lost
him
to
me
in
the
meanwhile
i
had
to
produce
my
reason
for
advising
her
to
wait
it
was
easily
done
i
reminded
her
of
the
irritable
condition
of
our
father
s
nerves
and
gave
it
as
my
opinion
that
he
would
certainly
say
no
if
she
was
unwise
enough
to
excite
him
on
the
subject
of
philip
in
his
present
frame
of
mind
these
unanswerable
considerations
seemed
to
produce
the
right
effect
on
her
i
suppose
you
know
best
was
all
she
said
and
then
she
left
me
i
let
her
go
without
feeling
any
distrust
of
this
act
of
submission
on
her
part
it
was
such
a
common
experience
in
my
life
to
find
my
sister
guiding
herself
by
my
advice
but
experience
is
not
always
to
be
trusted
events
soon
showed
that
i
had
failed
to
estimate
eunice
s
resources
of
obstinacy
and
cunning
at
their
true
value
half
an
hour
later
i
heard
the
street
door
closed
and
looked
out
of
the
window
miss
jillgall
was
leaving
the
house
no
one
was
with
her
my
dislike
of
this
person
led
me
astray
once
more
i
ought
to
have
suspected
her
of
being
bent
on
some
mischievous
errand
and
to
have
devised
some
means
of
putting
my
suspicions
to
the
test
i
did
nothing
of
the
kind
in
the
moment
when
i
turned
my
head
away
from
the
window
miss
jillgall
was
a
person
forgotten
and
i
was
a
person
who
had
made
a
serious
mistake
chapter
xxvi
helena
s
diary
the
event
of
began
with
the
delivery
of
a
message
summoning
me
to
my
father
s
study
he
had
decided
too
hastily
as
i
feared
that
he
was
sufficiently
recovered
to
resume
his
usual
employments
i
was
writing
to
his
dictation
when
we
were
interrupted
maria
announced
a
visit
from
dunboyne
hitherto
philip
had
been
content
to
send
one
of
the
servants
of
the
hotel
to
make
inquiry
after
gracedieu
s
health
why
had
he
now
called
personally
noticing
that
father
seemed
to
be
annoyed
i
tried
to
make
an
opportunity
of
receiving
philip
myself
let
me
see
him
i
suggested
i
can
easily
say
you
are
very
unwillingly
as
it
was
easy
to
see
my
father
declined
to
allow
this
mr
dunboyne
s
visit
pays
me
a
compliment
he
said
and
i
must
receive
i
made
a
show
of
leaving
the
room
and
was
called
back
to
my
chair
this
is
not
a
private
interview
helena
stay
where
you
philip
came
in
handsomer
than
ever
beautifully
dressed
and
paid
his
respects
to
my
father
with
his
customary
grace
he
was
too
to
allow
any
visible
signs
of
embarrassment
to
escape
him
but
when
he
shook
hands
with
me
i
felt
a
little
trembling
in
his
fingers
through
the
delicate
gloves
which
fitted
him
like
a
second
skin
was
it
the
true
object
of
his
visit
to
try
the
experiment
designed
by
eunice
and
himself
and
deferred
by
the
postponement
of
our
impossible
surely
that
my
sister
could
have
practiced
on
his
weakness
and
persuaded
him
to
return
to
his
first
love
i
waited
in
breathless
interest
for
his
next
words
they
were
not
worth
listening
to
oh
the
poor
commonplace
creature
i
am
glad
gracedieu
to
see
that
you
are
well
enough
to
be
in
your
study
again
he
said
the
writing
materials
on
the
table
attracted
his
attention
am
i
one
of
the
idle
people
he
asked
with
his
charming
smile
who
are
always
interrupting
useful
employment
he
spoke
to
my
father
and
he
was
answered
by
my
father
not
once
had
he
addressed
a
word
to
me
no
not
even
when
we
shook
hands
i
was
angry
enough
to
force
him
into
taking
some
notice
of
me
and
to
make
an
attempt
to
confuse
him
at
the
same
time
have
you
seen
my
sister
i
asked
it
was
the
shortest
reply
that
he
could
choose
having
flung
it
at
me
he
still
persisted
in
looking
at
my
father
and
speaking
to
my
father
do
you
think
of
trying
change
of
air
gracedieu
when
you
feel
strong
enough
to
travel
my
duties
keep
me
here
father
answered
and
i
can
not
honestly
say
that
i
enjoy
traveling
i
dislike
manners
and
customs
that
are
strange
to
me
i
don
t
find
that
hotels
reward
me
for
giving
up
the
comforts
of
my
own
house
how
do
you
find
the
hotel
here
i
submit
to
the
hotel
sir
they
are
sad
savages
in
the
kitchen
they
put
mushroom
ketchup
into
their
soup
and
mustard
and
cayenne
pepper
into
their
salads
i
am
at
but
i
don
t
every
word
he
said
was
an
offense
to
me
with
or
without
reason
i
attacked
him
again
i
have
heard
you
acknowledge
that
the
landlord
and
landlady
are
very
obliging
people
i
said
why
don
t
you
ask
them
to
let
you
make
your
own
soup
and
mix
your
own
salad
i
wondered
whether
i
should
succeed
in
attracting
his
notice
after
this
even
in
these
private
pages
my
finds
it
hard
to
confess
what
happened
i
succeeded
in
reminding
philip
that
he
had
his
reasons
for
requesting
me
to
leave
the
room
will
you
excuse
me
miss
helena
he
said
if
i
ask
leave
to
speak
to
gracedieu
in
private
the
right
thing
for
me
to
do
was
let
me
hope
the
thing
that
i
did
i
rose
and
waited
to
see
if
my
father
would
interfere
he
looked
at
philip
with
suspicion
in
his
face
as
well
as
surprise
may
i
ask
he
said
coldly
what
is
the
object
of
the
interview
certainly
philip
answered
when
we
are
this
cool
reply
placed
my
father
between
two
alternatives
he
must
either
give
way
or
be
guilty
of
an
act
of
rudeness
to
a
guest
in
his
own
house
the
choice
reserved
for
me
was
narrower
still
i
had
to
decide
between
being
told
to
go
or
going
of
my
own
accord
of
course
i
left
them
together
the
door
which
communicated
with
the
next
room
was
pulled
to
but
not
closed
on
the
other
side
of
it
i
found
eunice
listening
i
said
in
a
whisper
yes
she
whispered
back
you
listen
too
i
was
so
indignant
with
philip
and
so
seriously
interested
in
what
was
going
on
in
the
study
that
i
yielded
to
temptation
we
both
degraded
ourselves
we
both
listened
eunice
s
base
lover
spoke
first
judging
by
the
change
in
his
voice
he
must
have
seen
something
in
my
father
s
face
that
daunted
him
eunice
heard
it
too
he
s
getting
nervous
she
whispered
he
ll
forget
to
say
the
right
thing
at
the
right
mr
gracedieu
philip
began
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
father
interrupted
him
we
are
alone
now
dunboyne
i
want
to
know
why
you
consult
me
in
private
i
am
anxious
to
consult
you
sir
on
a
subject
on
what
subject
any
religious
difficulty
anything
i
can
do
for
you
in
the
town
not
at
all
if
you
will
only
allow
me
i
am
still
waiting
sir
to
know
what
it
is
philip
s
voice
suddenly
became
an
angry
voice
once
for
all
gracedieu
he
said
will
you
let
me
speak
it
s
about
your
daughter
no
more
of
it
dunboyne
my
father
was
now
as
loud
as
philip
i
don
t
desire
to
hold
a
private
conversation
with
you
on
the
subject
of
my
if
you
have
any
personal
objection
to
me
sir
be
so
good
as
to
state
it
you
have
no
right
to
ask
me
to
do
you
refuse
to
do
it
you
are
not
very
civil
if
i
speak
without
ceremony
dunboyne
you
have
yourself
to
thank
for
philip
replied
to
this
in
a
tone
of
savage
irony
you
are
a
minister
of
religion
and
you
are
an
old
man
two
privileges
and
you
presume
on
them
both
i
drew
back
into
a
corner
just
in
time
to
escape
discovery
in
the
character
of
a
listener
eunice
never
moved
when
philip
dashed
into
the
room
banging
the
door
after
him
she
threw
herself
impulsively
on
his
breast
oh
philip
philip
what
have
you
done
why
didn
t
you
keep
your
temper
did
you
hear
what
your
father
said
to
me
he
asked
yes
dear
but
you
ought
to
have
controlled
yourself
you
ought
indeed
for
my
her
arms
were
still
round
him
it
struck
me
that
he
felt
her
influence
if
you
wish
me
to
recover
myself
he
said
gently
you
had
better
let
me
oh
how
cruel
philip
to
leave
me
when
i
am
so
wretched
why
do
you
want
to
go
you
told
me
just
now
what
i
ought
to
do
he
answered
still
restraining
himself
if
i
am
to
get
the
better
of
my
temper
i
must
be
left
i
never
said
anything
about
your
temper
didn
t
you
tell
me
to
control
myself
oh
yes
go
back
to
papa
and
beg
him
to
forgive
i
ll
see
him
damned
first
if
ever
a
stupid
girl
deserved
such
an
answer
as
this
the
girl
was
my
sister
i
had
hitherto
with
some
difficulty
refrained
from
interfering
but
when
eunice
tried
to
follow
philip
out
of
the
house
i
could
hesitate
no
longer
i
held
her
back
you
fool
i
said
haven
t
you
made
mischief
enough
already
what
am
i
to
do
she
burst
out
helplessly
do
what
i
told
you
to
do
yesterday
before
she
could
reply
or
i
could
say
anything
more
the
door
that
led
to
the
landing
was
opened
softly
and
slyly
and
miss
jillgall
peeped
in
eunice
instantly
left
me
and
ran
to
the
meddling
old
maid
they
whispered
to
each
other
miss
jillgall
s
skinny
arm
encircled
my
sister
s
waist
they
disappeared
together
i
was
only
too
glad
to
get
rid
of
them
both
and
to
take
the
opportunity
of
writing
to
philip
i
insisted
on
an
explanation
of
his
conduct
while
i
was
in
the
study
to
be
given
within
an
hour
s
time
at
a
place
which
i
appointed
you
are
not
to
attempt
to
justify
yourself
in
writing
i
added
in
conclusion
let
your
reply
merely
inform
me
if
you
can
keep
the
appointment
the
rest
when
we
maria
took
the
letter
to
the
hotel
with
instructions
to
wait
philip
s
reply
reached
me
without
delay
it
pledged
him
to
justify
himself
as
i
had
desired
and
to
keep
the
appointment
my
own
belief
is
that
the
event
of
will
decide
his
future
and
mine
chapter
xxvii
eunice
s
diary
indeed
i
am
a
most
unfortunate
creature
everything
turns
out
badly
with
me
my
good
true
friend
my
dear
selina
has
become
the
object
of
a
hateful
doubt
in
my
secret
mind
i
am
afraid
she
is
keeping
something
from
me
talking
with
her
about
my
troubles
i
heard
for
the
first
time
that
she
had
written
again
to
tenbruggen
the
object
of
her
letter
was
to
tell
her
friend
of
my
engagement
to
young
dunboyne
i
asked
her
why
she
had
done
this
the
answer
informed
me
that
there
was
no
knowing
in
the
present
state
of
my
affairs
how
soon
i
might
not
want
the
help
of
a
clever
woman
i
ought
i
suppose
to
have
been
satisfied
with
this
but
there
seemed
to
be
something
not
fully
explained
yet
then
again
after
telling
selina
what
i
heard
in
the
study
and
how
roughly
philip
had
spoken
to
me
afterward
i
asked
her
what
she
thought
of
it
she
made
an
incomprehensible
reply
my
sweet
child
i
mustn
t
think
of
it
i
am
too
fond
of
it
was
impossible
to
make
her
explain
what
this
meant
she
began
to
talk
of
philip
assuring
me
which
was
quite
needless
that
she
had
done
her
best
to
fortify
and
encourage
him
before
he
called
on
papa
when
i
asked
her
to
help
me
in
another
way
that
is
to
say
when
i
wanted
to
find
out
where
philip
was
at
that
moment
she
had
no
advice
to
give
me
i
told
her
that
i
should
not
enjoy
a
moment
s
ease
of
mind
until
i
and
my
dear
one
were
reconciled
she
only
shook
her
head
and
declared
that
she
was
sorry
for
me
when
i
hit
on
the
idea
of
ringing
for
maria
this
little
woman
so
bright
and
quick
and
eager
to
help
me
at
other
times
said
i
leave
it
to
you
dear
and
turned
to
the
piano
close
to
which
i
was
sitting
and
played
softly
and
badly
stupid
little
tunes
maria
did
you
open
the
door
for
dunboyne
when
he
went
away
just
now
no
nothing
but
for
me
if
i
had
been
left
to
my
own
devices
i
should
now
have
let
the
housemaid
go
but
selina
contrived
to
give
me
a
hint
on
a
strange
plan
of
her
own
still
at
the
piano
she
began
to
confuse
talking
to
herself
with
playing
to
herself
the
notes
went
and
the
tongue
mixed
up
words
with
the
notes
in
this
way
perhaps
they
have
been
talking
in
the
kitchen
about
philip
the
suggestion
was
not
lost
on
me
i
said
to
maria
who
was
standing
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
near
the
door
did
you
happen
to
hear
which
way
dunboyne
went
when
he
left
us
i
know
where
he
was
miss
half
an
hour
where
was
he
at
the
selina
went
on
with
her
hints
in
the
same
way
as
before
how
does
she
know
ah
how
does
she
know
was
the
vocal
part
of
the
performance
this
time
my
clever
inquiries
followed
the
vocal
part
as
before
how
do
you
know
that
dunboyne
was
at
the
hotel
i
was
sent
there
with
a
letter
for
him
and
waited
for
the
there
was
no
suggestion
required
this
time
the
one
possible
question
was
who
sent
you
maria
replied
after
first
reserving
a
condition
you
won
t
tell
upon
me
miss
i
promised
not
to
tell
selina
suddenly
left
off
playing
well
i
repeated
who
sent
you
miss
selina
looked
round
at
me
her
little
eyes
seemed
to
have
suddenly
become
big
they
stared
me
so
strangely
in
the
face
i
don
t
know
whether
she
was
in
a
state
of
fright
or
of
wonder
as
for
myself
i
simply
lost
the
use
of
my
tongue
maria
having
no
more
questions
to
answer
discreetly
left
us
together
why
should
helena
write
to
philip
at
all
and
especially
without
mentioning
it
to
me
here
was
a
riddle
which
was
more
than
i
could
guess
i
asked
selina
to
help
me
she
might
at
least
have
tried
i
thought
but
she
looked
uneasy
and
made
excuses
i
said
suppose
i
go
to
helena
and
ask
her
why
she
wrote
to
philip
and
selina
said
suppose
you
do
i
rang
for
maria
once
more
do
you
know
where
my
sister
is
just
gone
out
there
was
no
help
for
it
but
to
wait
till
she
came
back
and
to
get
through
the
time
in
the
interval
as
i
best
might
but
for
one
circumstance
i
might
not
have
known
what
to
do
the
truth
is
there
was
a
feeling
of
shame
in
me
when
i
remembered
having
listened
at
the
study
door
curious
notions
come
into
one
s
head
one
doesn
t
know
how
or
why
it
struck
me
that
i
might
make
a
kind
of
atonement
for
having
been
mean
enough
to
listen
if
i
went
to
papa
and
offered
to
keep
him
company
in
his
solitude
if
we
fell
into
pleasant
talk
i
had
a
sly
idea
of
my
own
i
meant
to
put
in
a
good
word
for
poor
philip
when
i
confided
my
design
to
selina
she
shut
up
the
piano
and
ran
across
the
room
to
me
but
somehow
she
was
not
like
her
old
self
again
yet
you
good
little
soul
you
are
always
right
look
at
me
again
euneece
are
you
beginning
to
doubt
me
oh
my
darling
don
t
do
that
it
isn
t
using
me
fairly
i
can
t
bear
it
i
can
t
bear
it
i
took
her
hand
i
was
on
the
point
of
speaking
to
her
with
the
kindness
she
deserved
from
me
on
a
sudden
she
snatched
her
hand
away
and
ran
back
to
the
piano
when
she
was
seated
on
the
her
face
was
hidden
from
me
at
that
moment
she
broke
into
a
strange
cry
it
began
like
a
laugh
and
it
ended
like
a
sob
go
away
to
papa
don
t
mind
me
i
m
a
creature
of
impulse
ha
ha
ha
a
little
hysterical
the
state
of
the
weather
i
get
rid
of
these
weaknesses
my
dear
by
singing
to
myself
i
have
a
favorite
song
my
heart
is
light
my
will
is
go
away
oh
for
god
s
sake
go
away
i
had
heard
of
hysterics
of
course
knowing
nothing
about
them
however
by
my
own
experience
what
could
have
happened
to
agitate
her
in
this
extraordinary
manner
had
helena
s
letter
anything
to
do
with
it
was
my
sister
indignant
with
philip
for
swearing
in
my
presence
and
had
she
written
him
an
angry
letter
in
her
zeal
on
my
behalf
but
selina
could
not
possibly
have
seen
the
letter
and
helena
who
is
often
hard
on
me
when
i
do
stupid
things
showed
little
indulgence
for
me
when
i
was
so
unfortunate
as
to
irritate
philip
i
gave
up
the
hopeless
attempt
to
get
at
the
truth
by
guessing
and
went
away
to
forget
my
troubles
if
i
could
in
my
father
s
society
after
knocking
twice
at
the
door
of
the
study
and
receiving
no
reply
i
ventured
to
look
in
the
sofa
in
this
room
stood
opposite
the
door
papa
was
resting
on
it
but
not
in
comfort
there
were
twitching
movements
in
his
feet
and
he
shifted
his
arms
this
way
and
that
as
if
no
restful
posture
could
he
found
for
them
but
what
frightened
me
was
this
his
eyes
staring
straight
at
the
door
by
which
i
had
gone
in
had
an
inquiring
expression
as
if
he
actually
did
not
know
me
i
stood
midway
between
the
door
and
the
sofa
doubtful
about
going
nearer
to
him
he
said
who
is
it
this
to
me
to
his
own
daughter
he
said
what
do
you
want
i
really
could
bear
it
i
went
up
to
him
i
said
papa
have
you
forgotten
eunice
my
name
seemed
if
one
may
say
such
a
thing
to
bring
him
to
himself
again
he
sat
upon
the
sofa
and
laughed
as
he
answered
me
my
dear
child
what
delusion
has
got
into
that
pretty
little
head
of
yours
fancy
her
thinking
that
i
had
forgotten
my
own
daughter
i
was
lost
in
thought
eunice
for
the
moment
i
was
what
they
call
an
absent
man
did
i
ever
tell
you
the
story
of
the
absent
man
he
went
to
call
upon
some
acquaintance
of
his
and
when
the
servant
said
what
name
sir
he
couldn
t
answer
he
was
obliged
to
confess
that
he
had
forgotten
his
own
name
the
servant
said
that
s
very
the
absent
man
at
once
recovered
himself
that
s
it
he
said
my
name
is
droll
isn
t
it
if
i
had
been
calling
on
a
friend
i
daresay
might
have
forgotten
my
name
too
much
to
think
of
eunice
too
much
to
think
leaving
the
sofa
with
a
sigh
as
if
he
was
tired
of
it
he
began
walking
up
and
down
he
seemed
to
be
still
in
good
spirits
well
my
dear
he
said
what
can
i
do
for
you
i
came
here
papa
to
see
if
there
was
anything
i
could
do
for
he
looked
at
some
sheets
of
paper
strung
together
and
laid
on
the
table
they
were
covered
with
writing
from
his
dictation
in
my
sister
s
hand
i
ought
to
get
on
with
my
work
he
said
where
is
helena
i
told
him
that
she
had
gone
out
and
begged
leave
to
try
what
i
could
do
to
supply
her
place
the
request
seemed
to
please
him
but
he
wanted
time
to
think
i
waited
noticing
that
his
face
grew
gradually
worried
and
anxious
there
came
a
vacant
look
into
his
eyes
which
it
grieved
me
to
see
he
appeared
to
have
quite
lost
himself
again
read
the
last
page
he
said
pointing
to
the
manuscript
on
the
table
i
don
t
remember
where
i
left
i
turned
to
the
last
page
as
well
as
i
could
tell
it
related
to
some
publication
which
he
was
recommending
to
religious
persons
of
our
way
of
thinking
before
i
had
read
through
it
he
began
to
dictate
speaking
so
rapidly
that
my
pen
was
not
always
able
to
follow
him
my
handwriting
is
as
bad
as
bad
can
be
when
i
am
hurried
to
make
matters
worse
still
i
was
confused
what
he
was
now
saying
seemed
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
what
i
had
been
reading
let
me
try
if
i
can
call
to
mind
the
substance
of
it
he
began
in
the
most
strangely
sudden
way
by
asking
why
should
there
be
any
fear
of
discovery
when
every
possible
care
had
been
taken
to
prevent
it
the
danger
from
unexpected
events
was
far
more
disquieting
a
man
might
find
himself
bound
in
honor
to
disclose
what
it
had
been
the
chief
anxiety
of
his
life
to
conceal
for
example
could
he
let
an
innocent
person
be
the
victim
of
deliberate
suppression
of
the
truth
no
matter
how
justifiable
that
suppression
might
appear
to
be
on
the
other
hand
dreadful
consequences
might
follow
an
honorable
confession
there
might
be
a
cruel
sacrifice
of
tender
affection
there
might
be
a
shocking
betrayal
of
innocent
hope
and
i
remember
those
last
words
just
as
he
dictated
them
because
he
suddenly
stopped
there
looking
poor
dear
distressed
and
confused
he
put
his
hand
to
his
head
and
went
back
to
the
sofa
i
m
tired
he
said
wait
for
me
while
i
in
a
few
minutes
he
fell
asleep
it
was
a
deep
repose
that
came
to
him
now
and
though
i
don
t
think
it
lasted
much
longer
than
half
an
hour
it
produced
a
wonderful
change
in
him
for
the
better
when
he
woke
he
spoke
quietly
and
kindly
and
when
he
returned
to
me
at
the
table
and
looked
at
the
page
on
which
i
had
been
writing
he
smiled
oh
my
dear
what
bad
writing
i
declare
i
can
t
read
what
i
myself
told
you
to
write
no
no
don
t
be
downhearted
about
it
you
are
not
used
to
writing
from
dictation
and
i
daresay
i
have
been
too
quick
for
he
kissed
me
and
encouraged
me
you
know
how
fond
i
am
of
my
little
girl
he
said
i
am
afraid
i
like
my
eunice
just
the
least
in
the
world
more
than
i
like
my
helena
ah
you
are
beginning
to
look
a
little
happier
now
he
had
filled
me
with
such
confidence
and
such
pleasure
that
i
could
not
help
thinking
of
my
sweetheart
oh
dear
when
shall
i
learn
to
be
distrustful
of
my
own
feelings
the
temptation
to
say
a
good
word
for
philip
quite
mastered
any
little
discretion
that
i
possessed
i
said
to
papa
if
you
knew
how
to
make
me
happier
than
i
have
ever
been
in
all
my
life
before
would
you
do
it
of
course
i
then
send
for
philip
dear
and
be
a
little
kinder
to
him
this
his
pale
face
turned
red
with
anger
he
pushed
me
away
from
him
that
man
again
he
burst
out
am
i
never
to
hear
the
last
of
him
go
away
eunice
you
are
of
no
use
he
took
up
my
unfortunate
page
of
writing
and
ridiculed
it
with
a
bitter
laugh
what
is
this
fit
for
he
crumpled
it
up
in
his
hand
and
tossed
it
into
the
fire
i
ran
out
of
the
room
in
such
a
state
of
mortification
that
i
hardly
knew
what
i
was
about
if
some
person
had
come
to
me
with
a
cup
of
poison
and
had
said
eunice
you
are
not
fit
to
live
any
longer
take
this
i
do
believe
i
should
have
taken
it
if
i
thought
of
anything
i
thought
of
going
back
to
selina
my
ill
luck
still
pursued
me
she
had
disappeared
i
looked
about
in
a
helpless
way
completely
at
a
loss
what
to
do
next
so
stupefied
i
may
even
say
that
it
was
some
time
before
i
noticed
a
little
note
on
the
table
by
which
i
was
standing
the
note
was
addressed
to
me
euneece
i
have
tried
to
make
myself
useful
to
you
and
have
failed
but
how
can
i
see
the
sad
sight
of
your
wretchedness
and
not
feel
the
impulse
to
try
again
i
have
gone
to
the
hotel
to
find
philip
and
to
bring
him
back
to
you
a
penitent
and
faithful
man
wait
for
me
and
hope
for
great
things
hundred
thousand
kisses
to
my
sweet
euneece
s
wait
for
her
after
reading
that
note
how
could
she
expect
it
i
had
only
to
follow
her
and
to
find
philip
in
another
minute
i
was
on
my
way
to
the
hotel
chapter
xxviii
helena
s
diary
looking
at
the
last
entry
in
my
journal
i
see
myself
anticipating
that
the
event
of
will
decide
philip
s
future
and
mine
this
has
proved
prophetic
all
further
concealment
is
now
at
an
end
forced
to
it
by
fate
or
helped
to
it
by
chance
eunice
has
made
the
discovery
of
her
lover
s
infidelity
in
all
human
probability
as
my
father
says
in
his
sermons
we
two
sisters
are
enemies
for
life
i
am
not
suspected
as
eunice
is
of
making
appointments
with
a
sweetheart
so
i
am
free
to
go
out
alone
and
to
go
where
i
please
philip
and
i
were
punctual
to
our
appointment
this
afternoon
our
place
of
meeting
was
in
a
secluded
corner
of
the
town
park
we
found
a
rustic
seat
in
our
retirement
set
up
one
would
suppose
as
a
concession
to
the
taste
of
visitors
who
are
fond
of
solitude
the
view
in
front
of
us
was
bounded
by
the
park
wall
and
railings
and
our
seat
was
prettily
approached
on
one
side
by
a
plantation
of
young
trees
no
entrance
gate
was
near
no
carriage
road
crossed
the
grass
a
more
safe
and
more
solitary
nook
for
conversation
between
two
persons
desiring
to
be
alone
it
would
be
hard
to
find
in
most
public
parks
lovers
are
said
to
know
it
well
and
to
be
especially
fond
of
it
toward
evening
we
were
there
in
broad
daylight
and
we
had
the
seat
to
ourselves
my
memory
of
what
passed
between
us
is
in
some
degree
disturbed
by
the
formidable
interruption
which
brought
our
talk
to
an
end
but
among
other
things
i
remember
that
i
showed
him
no
mercy
at
the
outset
at
one
time
i
was
indignant
at
another
i
was
scornful
i
declared
in
regard
to
my
object
in
meeting
him
that
i
had
changed
my
mind
and
had
decided
to
shorten
a
disagreeable
interview
by
waiving
my
right
to
an
explanation
and
bidding
him
farewell
eunice
as
i
pointed
out
had
the
first
claim
to
him
eunice
was
much
more
likely
to
suit
him
as
a
companion
for
life
than
i
was
in
short
i
said
in
conclusion
my
inclination
for
once
takes
sides
with
my
duty
and
leaves
my
sister
in
undisturbed
possession
of
young
with
this
satirical
explanation
i
rose
to
say
i
had
merely
intended
to
irritate
him
he
showed
a
superiority
to
anger
for
which
i
was
not
prepared
be
so
kind
as
to
sit
down
again
he
said
quietly
he
took
my
letter
from
his
pocket
and
pointed
to
that
part
of
it
which
alluded
to
his
conduct
when
we
had
met
in
my
father
s
study
you
have
offered
me
the
opportunity
of
saying
a
word
in
my
own
defense
he
went
on
i
prize
that
privilege
far
too
highly
to
consent
to
your
withdrawing
it
merely
because
you
have
changed
your
mind
let
me
at
least
tell
you
what
my
errand
was
when
i
called
on
your
father
loving
you
and
you
only
i
had
forced
myself
to
make
a
last
effort
to
be
true
to
your
sister
remember
that
helena
and
then
say
is
it
wonderful
if
i
was
beside
myself
when
i
found
you
in
the
study
when
you
tell
me
you
were
beside
yourself
i
said
do
you
mean
ashamed
of
yourself
that
touched
him
i
mean
nothing
of
the
kind
he
burst
out
after
the
hell
on
earth
in
which
i
have
been
living
between
you
two
sisters
a
man
hasn
t
virtue
enough
left
in
him
to
be
ashamed
he
s
half
mad
that
s
what
he
is
look
at
my
position
i
had
made
up
my
mind
never
to
see
you
again
i
had
made
up
my
mind
if
i
married
eunice
to
rid
myself
of
my
own
miserable
life
when
i
could
endure
it
no
longer
in
that
state
of
feeling
when
my
sense
of
duty
depended
on
my
speaking
with
gracedieu
alone
whose
was
the
first
face
i
saw
when
i
entered
the
room
if
i
had
dared
to
look
at
you
or
to
speak
to
you
what
do
you
think
would
have
become
of
my
resolution
to
sacrifice
myself
what
has
become
of
it
now
i
asked
tell
me
first
if
i
am
forgiven
he
said
and
you
shall
do
you
deserve
to
be
forgiven
it
has
been
discovered
by
wiser
heads
than
mine
that
weak
people
are
always
in
extremes
so
far
i
had
seen
philip
in
the
vain
and
violent
extreme
he
now
shifted
suddenly
to
the
sad
and
submissive
extreme
when
i
asked
him
if
he
deserved
to
be
forgiven
he
made
the
humblest
of
all
replies
he
sighed
and
said
nothing
if
i
did
my
duty
to
my
sister
i
reminded
him
i
should
refuse
to
forgive
you
and
send
you
back
to
your
father
s
language
and
your
father
s
conduct
he
answered
have
released
me
from
that
entanglement
i
can
never
go
back
to
eunice
if
you
refuse
to
forgive
me
neither
you
nor
she
will
see
anything
more
of
philip
dunboyne
i
promise
you
that
are
you
satisfied
now
after
holding
out
against
him
resolutely
i
felt
myself
beginning
to
yield
when
a
man
has
once
taken
their
fancy
what
helplessly
weak
creatures
women
are
i
saw
through
his
vacillating
weakness
and
yet
i
trusted
him
with
both
eyes
open
my
is
opposite
to
me
while
i
write
it
shows
me
a
contemptible
helena
i
lied
and
said
i
was
satisfied
to
please
am
i
forgiven
he
asked
it
is
absurd
to
put
it
on
record
of
course
i
forgave
him
what
a
good
christian
i
am
after
all
he
took
my
willing
hand
my
lovely
darling
he
said
our
marriage
rests
with
you
whether
your
father
approves
of
it
or
not
say
the
word
claim
me
and
i
am
yours
for
i
must
have
been
infatuated
by
his
voice
and
his
look
my
heart
must
have
been
burning
under
the
pressure
of
his
hand
on
mine
was
it
my
modesty
or
my
that
deserted
me
i
let
him
take
me
in
his
arms
again
and
again
and
again
i
kissed
him
we
were
deaf
to
what
we
ought
to
have
heard
we
were
blind
to
what
we
ought
to
have
seen
before
we
were
conscious
of
a
movement
among
the
trees
we
were
discovered
my
sister
flew
at
me
like
a
wild
animal
her
furious
hands
fastened
themselves
on
my
throat
philip
started
to
his
feet
when
he
touched
her
in
the
act
of
forcing
her
back
from
me
eunice
s
raging
strength
became
utter
weakness
in
an
instant
her
arms
fell
helpless
at
her
sides
her
head
drooped
she
looked
at
him
in
silence
which
was
dreadful
at
such
a
moment
as
that
he
shrank
from
the
unendurable
reproach
in
those
tearless
eyes
meanly
he
turned
away
from
her
meanly
i
followed
him
looking
back
for
an
instant
i
saw
her
step
forward
perhaps
to
stop
him
perhaps
to
speak
to
him
the
effort
was
too
much
for
her
strength
she
staggered
back
against
the
trunk
of
a
tree
like
strangers
walking
separate
one
from
the
other
we
left
her
to
her
companion
the
hideous
traitress
who
was
my
enemy
and
her
friend
chapter
xxix
helena
s
diary
on
reaching
the
street
which
led
to
philip
s
hotel
we
spoke
to
each
other
for
the
first
time
what
are
we
to
do
i
said
leave
this
place
he
answered
together
i
asked
to
leave
us
for
a
while
after
what
had
happened
might
be
the
wisest
thing
which
a
man
in
philip
s
critical
position
could
do
but
if
i
went
with
him
unprovided
as
i
was
with
any
friend
of
my
own
sex
whose
character
and
presence
might
sanction
the
step
i
had
taken
i
should
be
lost
beyond
redemption
is
any
man
that
ever
lived
worth
that
sacrifice
i
thought
of
my
father
s
house
closed
to
me
and
of
our
friends
ashamed
of
me
i
have
owned
in
some
earlier
part
of
my
journal
that
i
am
not
very
patient
under
domestic
cares
but
the
possibility
of
eunice
being
appointed
housekeeper
with
my
power
in
my
place
was
more
than
i
could
calmly
contemplate
no
i
said
to
philip
your
absence
at
such
a
time
as
this
may
help
us
both
but
come
what
may
of
it
i
must
remain
at
he
yielded
without
an
attempt
to
make
me
alter
my
mind
there
was
a
sullen
submission
in
his
manner
which
it
was
not
pleasant
to
see
was
he
despairing
already
of
himself
and
of
me
had
eunice
aroused
the
watchful
demons
of
shame
and
remorse
perhaps
you
are
right
he
said
gloomily
my
anxiety
put
the
question
to
him
without
hesitation
is
it
forever
philip
his
reply
instantly
relieved
me
god
forbid
but
i
wanted
more
you
still
love
me
i
persisted
more
dearly
than
ever
and
yet
you
leave
me
he
turned
pale
i
leave
you
because
i
am
afraid
of
what
afraid
to
face
eunice
the
only
possible
way
out
of
our
difficulty
that
i
could
see
now
occurred
to
me
suppose
my
sister
can
be
prevailed
on
to
give
you
up
i
suggested
would
you
come
back
to
us
in
that
case
certainly
and
you
would
ask
my
father
to
consent
to
our
marriage
on
the
day
of
my
return
if
you
suppose
obstacles
get
in
our
way
i
said
suppose
time
passes
and
tries
your
patience
will
you
still
consider
yourself
engaged
to
me
engaged
to
you
he
answered
in
spite
of
obstacles
and
in
spite
of
and
while
you
are
away
from
me
i
ventured
to
add
we
shall
write
to
each
other
go
where
i
may
he
said
you
shall
always
hear
from
i
could
ask
no
more
and
he
could
concede
no
more
the
impression
evidently
left
on
him
by
eunice
s
terrible
outbreak
was
far
more
serious
than
i
had
anticipated
i
was
myself
depressed
and
ill
at
ease
no
expressions
of
tenderness
were
exchanged
between
us
there
was
something
horrible
in
our
barren
farewell
we
merely
clasped
hands
at
parting
he
went
his
way
and
i
went
mine
there
are
some
occasions
when
women
set
an
example
of
courage
to
men
i
was
ready
to
endure
whatever
might
happen
to
me
when
i
got
home
what
a
desperate
wretch
some
people
might
say
if
they
could
look
into
this
diary
maria
opened
the
door
she
told
me
that
my
sister
had
already
returned
accompanied
by
miss
jillgall
there
had
been
apparently
some
difference
of
opinion
between
them
before
they
entered
the
house
eunice
had
attempted
to
go
on
to
some
other
place
and
miss
jillgall
had
remonstrated
maria
had
heard
her
say
no
you
would
degrade
yourself
and
with
that
she
had
led
eunice
indoors
i
understood
of
course
that
my
sister
had
been
prevented
from
following
philip
to
the
hotel
there
was
probably
a
serious
quarrel
in
store
for
me
i
went
straight
to
the
bedroom
expecting
to
find
eunice
there
and
prepared
to
brave
the
storm
that
might
burst
on
me
there
was
a
woman
at
eunice
s
end
of
the
room
removing
dresses
from
the
wardrobe
i
could
only
see
her
back
but
it
was
impossible
to
mistake
figure
miss
jillgall
she
laid
the
dresses
on
eunice
s
bed
without
taking
the
slightest
notice
of
me
in
significant
silence
i
pointed
to
the
door
she
went
on
as
coolly
with
her
occupation
as
if
the
room
had
been
not
mine
but
hers
i
stepped
up
to
her
and
spoke
plainly
you
oblige
me
to
remind
you
i
said
that
you
are
not
in
your
own
there
i
waited
a
little
and
found
that
i
had
produced
no
effect
with
every
disposition
i
resumed
to
make
allowance
for
the
disagreeable
peculiarities
of
your
character
i
can
not
consent
to
overlook
an
act
of
intrusion
committed
by
a
spy
now
do
you
understand
me
she
looked
round
her
i
see
no
third
person
here
she
said
may
i
ask
if
you
mean
me
i
mean
will
you
be
so
good
miss
helena
as
to
explain
yourself
moderation
of
language
would
have
been
thrown
away
on
this
woman
you
followed
me
to
the
park
i
said
it
was
you
who
found
me
with
dunboyne
and
betrayed
me
to
my
sister
you
are
a
spy
and
you
know
it
at
this
very
moment
you
daren
t
look
me
in
the
her
insolence
forced
its
way
out
of
her
at
last
let
me
record
it
and
repay
it
when
the
time
comes
quite
true
she
replied
if
i
ventured
to
look
you
in
the
face
i
am
afraid
i
might
forget
myself
i
have
always
been
brought
up
like
a
lady
and
i
wish
to
show
it
even
in
the
company
of
such
a
wretch
as
you
are
there
is
not
one
word
of
truth
in
what
you
have
said
of
me
i
went
to
the
hotel
to
find
dunboyne
ah
you
may
sneer
i
haven
t
got
your
good
looks
and
a
vile
use
you
have
made
of
them
my
object
was
to
recall
that
base
young
man
to
his
duty
to
my
dear
charming
injured
euneece
the
hotel
servant
told
me
that
dunboyne
had
gone
out
oh
i
had
the
means
of
persuasion
in
my
pocket
the
man
directed
me
to
the
park
as
he
had
already
directed
dunboyne
it
was
only
when
i
had
found
the
place
that
i
heard
some
one
behind
me
poor
innocent
euneece
had
followed
me
to
the
hotel
and
had
got
her
directions
as
i
had
got
mine
god
knows
how
hard
i
tried
to
persuade
her
to
go
back
and
how
horribly
frightened
i
was
no
i
won
t
distress
myself
by
saying
a
word
more
it
would
be
too
humiliating
to
let
see
an
honest
woman
in
tears
your
sister
has
a
spirit
of
her
own
thank
god
she
won
t
inhabit
the
same
room
with
you
she
never
desires
to
see
your
false
face
again
i
take
the
poor
soul
s
dresses
and
things
away
and
as
a
religious
person
i
wait
confidently
wait
for
the
judgment
that
will
fall
on
you
she
caught
up
the
dresses
all
together
some
of
them
were
in
her
arms
some
of
them
fell
on
her
shoulders
and
one
of
them
towered
over
her
head
smothered
in
gowns
she
bounced
out
of
the
room
like
a
walking
milliner
s
shop
i
have
to
thank
the
wretched
old
creature
for
a
moment
of
genuine
amusement
at
a
time
of
devouring
anxiety
the
meanest
insect
they
say
has
its
use
in
this
world
and
why
not
miss
jillgall
in
half
an
hour
more
an
unexpected
event
raised
my
spirits
i
heard
from
philip
on
his
return
to
the
hotel
he
had
found
a
telegram
waiting
for
him
dunboyne
the
elder
had
arrived
in
london
and
philip
had
arranged
to
join
his
father
by
the
next
train
he
sent
me
the
address
and
begged
that
i
would
write
and
tell
him
my
news
from
home
by
the
next
day
s
post
welcome
thrice
welcome
to
dunboyne
the
elder
if
philip
can
manage
under
my
advice
to
place
me
favorably
in
the
estimation
of
this
rich
old
man
his
presence
and
authority
may
do
for
us
what
we
can
not
do
for
ourselves
here
is
surely
an
influence
to
which
my
father
must
submit
no
matter
how
unreasonable
or
how
angry
he
may
be
when
he
hears
what
has
happened
i
begin
already
to
feel
hopeful
of
the
future
chapter
xxx
eunice
s
diary
through
the
day
and
through
the
night
i
feel
a
misery
that
never
leaves
me
i
mean
the
misery
of
fear
i
am
trying
to
find
out
some
harmless
means
of
employing
myself
which
will
keep
evil
remembrances
from
me
if
i
don
t
succeed
my
fear
tells
me
what
will
happen
i
shall
be
in
danger
of
going
mad
i
dare
not
confide
in
any
living
creature
i
don
t
know
what
other
persons
might
think
of
me
or
how
soon
i
might
find
myself
perhaps
in
an
asylum
in
this
helpless
condition
doubt
and
fright
seem
to
be
driving
me
back
to
my
journal
i
wonder
whether
i
shall
find
harmless
employment
here
i
have
heard
of
old
people
losing
their
memories
what
would
i
not
give
to
be
old
i
remember
oh
how
i
remember
one
day
after
another
i
see
philip
i
see
helena
as
i
first
saw
them
when
i
was
among
the
trees
in
the
park
my
sweetheart
s
arms
that
once
held
me
hold
my
sister
now
she
kisses
him
kisses
him
kisses
him
is
there
no
way
of
making
myself
see
something
else
i
want
to
get
back
to
remembrances
that
don
t
burn
in
my
head
and
tear
at
my
heart
how
is
it
to
be
done
i
have
tried
books
no
i
have
tried
going
out
to
look
at
the
shops
no
i
have
tried
saying
my
prayers
no
and
now
i
am
making
my
last
effort
trying
my
pen
my
black
letters
fall
from
it
and
take
their
places
on
the
white
paper
will
my
black
letters
help
me
where
can
i
find
something
consoling
to
write
down
where
where
selina
poor
selina
so
fond
of
me
so
sorry
for
me
when
i
was
happy
she
was
happy
too
it
was
always
amusing
to
hear
her
talk
oh
my
memory
be
good
to
me
save
me
from
philip
and
helena
i
want
to
remember
the
pleasant
days
when
my
kind
little
friend
and
i
used
to
gossip
in
the
garden
no
the
days
in
the
garden
won
t
come
back
what
else
can
i
think
of
the
recollections
that
i
try
to
encourage
keep
away
from
me
the
other
recollections
that
i
dread
come
crowding
back
still
philip
still
helena
but
selina
mixes
herself
up
with
them
let
me
try
again
if
i
can
think
of
selina
how
delightfully
good
to
me
and
patient
with
me
she
was
on
our
dismal
way
home
from
the
park
and
how
affectionately
she
excused
herself
for
not
having
warned
me
of
it
when
she
first
suspected
that
my
own
sister
and
my
worst
enemy
were
one
and
the
same
i
know
i
was
wrong
my
dear
to
let
my
love
and
pity
close
my
lips
but
remember
how
happy
you
were
at
the
time
the
thought
of
making
you
miserable
was
more
than
i
could
endure
i
am
so
fond
of
you
yes
i
began
to
suspect
them
on
the
day
when
they
first
met
at
the
station
and
i
am
afraid
i
thought
it
just
likely
that
you
might
be
as
cunning
as
i
was
and
have
noticed
them
oh
how
ignorant
she
must
have
been
of
my
true
thoughts
and
feelings
how
strangely
people
seem
to
misunderstand
their
dearest
friends
knowing
as
i
did
that
i
could
never
love
any
man
but
philip
could
i
be
wicked
enough
to
suppose
that
philip
would
love
any
woman
but
me
i
explained
to
selina
how
he
had
spoken
to
me
when
we
were
walking
together
on
the
bank
of
the
river
shall
i
ever
forget
those
exquisite
words
i
wish
i
was
a
better
man
eunice
i
wish
i
was
good
enough
to
be
worthy
of
i
asked
selina
if
she
thought
he
was
deceiving
me
when
he
said
that
she
comforted
me
by
owning
that
he
must
have
been
in
earnest
at
the
time
and
then
she
distressed
me
by
giving
the
reason
why
my
love
you
must
have
innocently
said
something
to
him
when
you
and
he
were
alone
which
touched
his
conscience
when
he
a
conscience
and
made
him
ashamed
of
himself
ah
you
were
too
fond
of
him
to
see
how
he
changed
for
the
worse
when
your
vile
sister
joined
you
and
took
possession
of
him
again
it
made
my
heart
ache
to
see
you
so
unsuspicious
of
them
you
asked
me
my
poor
dear
if
they
had
quarreled
you
believed
they
were
tired
of
walking
by
the
river
when
it
was
you
they
were
tired
of
and
you
wondered
why
helena
took
him
to
see
the
school
my
child
she
was
the
leading
spirit
at
the
school
and
you
were
nobody
her
vanity
saw
the
chance
of
making
him
compare
you
at
a
disadvantage
with
your
clever
sister
i
declare
euneece
i
lose
my
head
if
i
only
think
of
it
all
the
strong
points
in
my
character
seem
to
slip
away
from
me
would
you
believe
it
i
have
neglected
that
sweet
infant
at
the
cottage
i
have
even
let
molly
have
her
baby
back
again
if
i
had
the
making
of
the
laws
philip
dunboyne
and
helena
gracedieu
should
be
hanged
together
on
the
same
gallows
i
see
i
shock
you
don
t
let
us
talk
of
it
oh
don
t
let
us
talk
of
it
and
here
am
i
writing
of
it
what
i
had
determined
not
to
do
is
what
i
have
done
am
i
losing
my
senses
already
the
very
names
that
i
was
most
anxious
to
keep
out
of
my
memory
stare
me
in
the
face
in
the
lines
that
i
have
just
written
philip
again
helena
again
another
day
and
something
new
that
must
and
will
be
remembered
shrink
from
it
as
i
may
this
afternoon
i
met
helena
on
the
stairs
she
stopped
and
eyed
me
with
a
wicked
smile
she
held
out
her
hand
we
are
likely
to
meet
often
while
we
are
in
the
same
house
she
said
hadn
t
we
better
consult
appearances
and
pretend
to
be
as
fond
of
each
other
as
ever
i
took
no
notice
of
her
hand
i
took
no
notice
of
her
shameless
proposal
she
tried
again
after
all
it
isn
t
my
fault
if
philip
likes
me
better
than
he
likes
you
don
t
you
see
that
i
still
refused
to
speak
to
her
she
still
persisted
how
black
you
look
eunice
are
you
sorry
you
didn
t
kill
me
when
you
had
your
hands
on
my
throat
i
said
she
laughed
and
left
me
i
was
obliged
to
sit
down
on
the
stair
i
trembled
so
my
own
reply
frightened
me
i
tried
to
find
out
why
i
had
said
yes
i
don
t
remember
being
conscious
of
meaning
anything
it
was
as
if
somebody
else
had
said
yes
not
i
perhaps
i
was
provoked
and
the
word
escaped
me
before
i
could
stop
it
could
i
have
stopped
it
i
don
t
know
another
sleepless
night
did
i
pass
the
miserable
hours
in
writing
letters
to
philip
and
then
tearing
them
up
or
did
i
only
fancy
that
i
wrote
to
him
i
have
just
looked
at
the
fireplace
the
torn
paper
in
it
tells
me
that
i
did
write
why
did
i
destroy
my
letters
i
might
have
sent
one
of
them
to
philip
after
what
has
happened
oh
no
no
having
been
many
days
away
from
the
girls
scripture
class
it
seemed
to
be
possible
that
going
back
to
the
school
and
the
teaching
might
help
me
to
escape
from
myself
nothing
succeeds
with
me
i
found
it
impossible
to
instruct
the
girls
as
usual
their
stupidity
soon
reached
the
limit
of
my
patience
suffocated
me
with
rage
one
of
them
a
poor
fat
feeble
creature
began
to
cry
when
i
scolded
her
i
looked
with
envy
at
the
tears
rolling
over
her
big
round
cheeks
if
i
could
only
cry
i
might
perhaps
bear
my
hard
fate
with
submission
i
walked
toward
home
by
a
roundabout
way
feeling
as
if
want
of
sleep
was
killing
me
by
inches
in
the
high
street
i
saw
helena
she
was
posting
a
letter
and
was
not
aware
that
i
was
near
her
leaving
the
she
crossed
the
street
and
narrowly
escaped
being
run
over
suppose
the
threatened
accident
had
really
taken
place
how
should
i
have
felt
if
it
had
ended
fatally
what
a
fool
i
am
to
be
putting
questions
to
myself
about
things
that
have
not
happened
the
walking
tired
me
i
went
straight
home
before
i
could
ring
the
bell
the
house
door
opened
and
the
doctor
came
out
he
stopped
to
speak
to
me
while
i
had
been
away
he
said
something
had
happened
at
home
he
neither
knew
nor
wished
to
know
what
which
had
thrown
my
father
into
a
state
of
violent
agitation
the
doctor
had
administered
composing
medicine
my
patient
is
asleep
now
he
told
me
but
remember
what
i
said
to
you
the
last
time
we
met
a
longer
rest
than
any
doctor
s
prescription
can
give
him
is
what
he
wants
you
are
not
looking
well
yourself
my
dear
what
is
the
matter
i
told
him
of
my
wretched
restless
nights
and
asked
if
i
might
take
some
of
the
composing
medicine
which
he
had
given
to
my
father
he
forbade
me
to
touch
a
drop
of
it
what
is
physic
for
your
father
you
foolish
child
is
not
physic
for
a
young
creature
like
you
he
said
count
a
thousand
if
you
can
t
sleep
or
turn
your
pillow
i
wish
you
pleasant
he
went
away
amused
at
his
own
humor
i
found
selina
waiting
to
speak
with
me
on
the
subject
of
poor
papa
she
had
been
startled
on
hearing
his
voice
loud
in
anger
in
the
fear
that
something
serious
had
happened
she
left
her
room
to
make
inquiries
and
saw
helena
on
the
landing
of
the
flight
of
stairs
beneath
leaving
the
study
after
waiting
till
my
sister
was
out
of
the
way
selina
ventured
to
present
herself
at
the
study
door
and
to
ask
if
she
could
be
of
any
use
my
father
walking
excitedly
up
and
down
the
room
declared
that
both
his
daughters
had
behaved
infamously
and
that
he
would
not
suffer
them
to
speak
to
him
again
until
they
had
come
to
their
senses
on
the
subject
of
dunboyne
he
would
enter
into
no
further
explanation
and
he
had
ordered
rather
than
requested
selina
to
leave
him
having
obeyed
she
tried
next
to
find
me
and
had
just
looked
into
the
to
see
if
i
was
there
when
she
was
frightened
by
the
sound
of
a
fall
in
the
room
above
that
is
to
say
in
the
study
running
upstairs
again
she
had
found
him
insensible
on
the
floor
and
had
sent
for
the
doctor
and
mind
this
selina
continued
the
person
who
has
done
the
mischief
is
the
person
whom
i
saw
leaving
the
study
what
your
unnatural
sister
said
to
provoke
her
father
that
your
unnatural
sister
will
tell
you
herself
helena
s
voice
added
she
had
opened
the
door
while
we
were
too
much
absorbed
in
our
talk
to
hear
her
selina
attempted
to
leave
the
room
i
caught
her
by
the
hand
and
held
her
back
i
was
afraid
of
what
i
might
do
if
she
left
me
by
myself
never
have
i
felt
anything
like
the
rage
that
tortured
me
when
i
saw
helena
looking
at
us
with
the
same
wicked
smile
on
her
lips
that
had
insulted
me
when
we
met
on
the
stairs
have
anything
to
be
ashamed
of
i
said
to
selina
stay
where
you
you
may
be
of
some
use
miss
jillgall
if
you
stay
my
sister
suggested
eunice
seems
to
be
trembling
is
she
angry
or
is
she
ill
the
sting
of
this
was
in
the
tone
of
her
voice
it
was
the
hardest
thing
i
ever
had
to
do
in
my
life
but
i
did
succeed
in
controlling
myself
go
on
with
what
you
have
to
say
i
answered
and
don
t
notice
you
are
not
very
polite
my
dear
but
i
can
make
allowances
oh
come
come
putting
up
your
hands
to
stop
your
ears
is
too
childish
you
would
do
better
to
express
regret
for
having
misled
your
father
yes
you
did
mislead
him
only
a
few
days
since
you
left
him
to
suppose
that
you
were
engaged
to
philip
it
became
my
duty
after
that
to
open
his
eyes
to
the
truth
and
if
i
unhappily
provoked
him
it
was
your
fault
i
was
strictly
careful
in
the
language
i
used
i
said
dear
father
you
have
been
misinformed
on
a
very
serious
subject
the
only
marriage
engagement
for
which
your
kind
sanction
is
requested
is
engagement
have
consented
to
become
philip
stop
i
said
why
am
i
to
stop
because
i
have
something
to
say
you
and
i
are
looking
at
each
other
does
my
face
tell
you
what
is
passing
in
my
mind
your
face
seems
to
be
paler
than
usual
she
answered
that
s
no
i
said
that
is
not
all
the
devil
that
possessed
me
when
i
discovered
you
with
philip
is
not
cast
out
of
me
yet
silence
the
sneering
devil
that
is
in
you
or
we
may
both
live
to
regret
whether
i
did
or
did
not
frighten
her
i
can
not
say
this
only
i
know
she
turned
away
silently
to
the
door
and
went
out
i
dropped
on
the
sofa
that
horrid
hungering
for
revenge
which
i
felt
for
the
first
time
when
i
knew
how
helena
had
wronged
me
began
to
degrade
and
tempt
me
again
in
the
effort
to
get
away
from
this
new
evil
self
of
mine
i
tried
to
find
sympathy
in
selina
and
called
to
her
to
come
and
sit
by
me
she
seemed
to
be
startled
when
i
looked
at
her
but
she
recovered
herself
and
came
to
me
and
took
my
hand
i
wish
i
could
comfort
you
she
said
in
her
kind
simple
way
keep
my
hand
in
your
hand
i
told
her
i
am
drowning
in
dark
water
and
i
have
nothing
to
hold
by
but
oh
my
darling
don
t
talk
in
that
way
good
selina
dear
selina
you
shall
talk
to
me
say
something
harmless
tell
me
a
melancholy
story
try
to
make
me
my
poor
little
friend
looked
sadly
bewildered
i
m
more
likely
to
cry
myself
she
said
this
is
so
i
almost
wish
i
was
back
in
the
time
before
you
came
home
the
time
when
your
detestable
sister
first
showed
how
she
hated
me
i
was
happy
meanly
happy
in
the
spiteful
enjoyment
of
provoking
her
oh
euneece
i
shall
never
recover
my
spirits
again
all
the
pity
in
the
world
would
not
be
pity
enough
for
so
hardly
treated
so
young
so
forlorn
your
good
father
too
ill
to
help
you
your
poor
mother
i
interrupted
her
she
had
interested
me
in
something
better
than
my
own
wretched
self
i
asked
directly
if
she
had
known
my
mother
my
dear
child
i
never
even
saw
her
has
my
father
never
spoken
to
you
about
her
only
once
when
i
asked
him
how
long
she
had
been
dead
he
told
me
you
lost
her
while
you
were
an
infant
and
he
told
me
no
more
i
was
looking
at
her
portrait
in
the
study
only
yesterday
i
think
it
must
be
a
bad
portrait
your
mother
s
face
disappoints
i
had
arrived
at
the
same
conclusion
years
since
but
i
shrank
from
confessing
it
at
any
rate
selina
continued
you
are
not
like
her
nobody
would
ever
guess
that
you
were
the
child
of
that
lady
with
the
long
slanting
forehead
and
the
restless
look
in
her
what
selina
had
said
of
me
and
my
mother
s
portrait
other
friends
had
said
there
was
nothing
that
i
know
of
to
interest
me
in
hearing
it
repeated
and
yet
it
set
me
pondering
on
the
want
of
resemblance
between
my
mother
s
face
and
mine
and
wondering
not
for
the
first
time
what
sort
of
woman
my
mother
was
when
my
father
speaks
of
her
no
words
of
praise
that
he
can
utter
seem
to
be
good
enough
for
her
oh
me
i
wish
i
was
a
little
more
like
my
mother
it
began
to
get
dark
maria
brought
in
the
lamp
the
sudden
brightness
of
the
flame
struck
my
aching
eyes
as
if
it
had
been
a
blow
from
a
knife
i
was
obliged
to
hide
my
face
in
my
handkerchief
compassionate
selina
entreated
me
to
go
to
bed
rest
your
poor
eyes
my
child
and
your
weary
head
and
try
at
least
to
get
some
she
found
me
very
docile
i
kissed
her
and
said
i
had
my
own
idea
when
all
was
quiet
in
the
house
i
stole
out
into
the
passage
and
listened
at
the
door
of
my
father
s
room
i
heard
his
regular
breathing
and
opened
the
door
and
went
in
the
composing
medicine
of
which
i
was
in
search
was
not
on
the
table
by
his
bedside
i
found
it
in
the
cupboard
perhaps
placed
purposely
out
of
his
reach
they
say
that
some
physic
is
poison
if
you
take
too
much
of
it
the
label
on
the
bottle
told
me
what
the
dose
was
i
dropped
it
into
the
medicine
glass
and
swallowed
it
and
went
back
to
my
father
very
gently
so
as
not
to
wake
him
i
touched
poor
papa
s
forehead
with
my
lips
i
must
have
some
of
your
medicine
i
whispered
to
him
i
want
it
dear
as
badly
as
you
then
i
returned
to
my
own
room
and
lay
down
in
bed
waiting
to
be
composed
chapter
xxxi
eunice
s
diary
my
restless
nights
are
passed
in
selina
s
room
her
bed
remains
near
the
window
my
bed
has
been
placed
opposite
near
the
door
our
is
hidden
in
a
corner
so
that
the
faint
glow
of
it
is
all
that
we
see
what
trifles
these
are
to
write
about
but
they
mix
themselves
up
with
what
i
am
determined
to
set
down
in
my
journal
and
then
to
close
the
book
for
good
and
all
i
had
not
disturbed
my
little
friend
s
enviable
repose
either
when
i
left
our
or
when
i
returned
to
it
the
night
was
quiet
and
the
stars
were
out
nothing
moved
but
the
throbbing
at
my
temples
the
lights
and
shadows
in
our
room
which
at
other
times
suggest
strange
resemblances
to
my
fancy
failed
to
disturb
me
now
i
was
in
a
darkness
of
my
own
making
having
bound
a
handkerchief
cooled
with
water
over
my
hot
eyes
there
was
nothing
to
interfere
with
the
soothing
influence
of
the
dose
that
i
had
taken
if
my
father
s
medicine
would
only
help
me
i
began
badly
the
clock
in
the
hall
struck
the
quarter
past
the
hour
the
the
past
the
new
hour
time
was
awake
and
i
was
awake
with
time
it
was
such
a
trial
to
my
patience
that
i
thought
of
going
back
to
my
father
s
room
and
taking
a
second
dose
of
the
medicine
no
matter
what
the
risk
might
be
on
attempting
to
get
up
i
became
aware
of
a
change
in
me
there
was
a
dull
sensation
in
my
limbs
which
seemed
to
bind
them
down
on
the
bed
it
was
the
strangest
feeling
my
will
said
get
up
and
my
heavy
limbs
said
no
i
lay
quite
still
thinking
desperate
thoughts
and
getting
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
end
that
i
had
been
dreading
for
so
many
days
past
having
been
as
well
educated
as
most
girls
my
lessons
in
history
had
made
me
acquainted
with
assassination
and
murder
horrors
which
i
had
recoiled
from
reading
in
past
happy
days
now
returned
to
my
memory
and
this
time
they
interested
instead
of
revolting
me
i
counted
the
three
first
ways
of
killing
as
i
happened
to
remember
them
in
my
books
of
instruction
a
way
by
stabbing
a
way
by
poison
a
way
in
a
bed
by
suffocation
with
a
pillow
on
that
dreadful
night
i
never
once
called
to
mind
what
i
find
myself
remembering
now
the
harmless
past
time
when
our
friends
used
to
say
eunice
is
a
good
girl
we
are
all
fond
of
shall
i
ever
be
the
same
lovable
creature
again
while
i
lay
thinking
a
strange
thing
happened
philip
who
had
haunted
me
for
days
and
nights
together
vanished
out
of
my
thoughts
my
memory
of
the
love
which
had
begun
so
brightly
and
had
ended
so
miserably
became
a
blank
nothing
was
left
but
my
own
horrid
visions
of
vengeance
and
death
for
a
while
the
strokes
of
the
clock
still
reached
my
ears
but
it
was
an
effort
to
count
them
i
ended
in
letting
them
pass
unheeded
soon
afterward
the
round
of
my
thoughts
began
to
circle
slowly
and
more
slowly
the
strokes
of
the
clock
died
out
the
round
of
my
thoughts
stopped
all
this
time
my
eyes
were
still
covered
by
the
handkerchief
which
i
had
laid
over
them
the
darkness
began
to
weigh
on
my
spirits
and
to
fill
me
with
distrust
i
found
myself
suspecting
that
there
was
some
change
perhaps
an
unearthly
change
passing
over
the
room
to
remain
blindfolded
any
longer
was
more
than
i
could
endure
i
lifted
my
hand
without
being
conscious
of
the
heavy
sensation
which
some
time
before
had
laid
my
limbs
helpless
on
the
bed
i
lifted
my
hand
and
drew
the
handkerchief
away
from
my
eyes
the
faint
glow
of
the
was
extinguished
but
the
room
was
not
quite
dark
there
was
a
ghastly
light
trembling
over
it
like
nothing
that
i
have
ever
seen
by
day
like
nothing
that
i
have
ever
seen
by
night
i
dimly
discerned
selina
s
bed
and
the
frame
of
the
window
and
the
curtains
on
either
side
of
it
but
not
the
starlight
and
not
the
shadowy
tops
of
the
trees
in
the
garden
the
light
grew
fainter
and
fainter
the
objects
in
the
room
faded
slowly
away
darkness
came
it
may
be
a
saying
hard
to
believe
but
when
i
declare
that
i
was
not
frightened
i
am
telling
the
truth
whether
the
room
was
lighted
by
awful
light
or
sunk
in
awful
dark
i
was
equally
interested
in
the
expectation
of
what
might
happen
next
i
listened
calmly
for
what
i
might
hear
i
waited
calmly
for
what
i
might
feel
a
touch
came
first
i
feel
it
creeping
on
my
face
like
a
little
fluttering
breeze
the
sensation
pleased
me
for
a
while
soon
it
grew
colder
and
colder
and
colder
till
it
froze
me
oh
no
more
i
cried
out
you
are
killing
me
with
an
icy
death
the
touches
lingered
a
moment
longer
and
left
me
the
first
sound
came
it
was
the
sound
of
a
whisper
on
my
pillow
close
to
my
ear
my
strange
insensibility
to
fear
remained
undisturbed
the
whisper
was
welcome
it
kept
me
company
in
the
dark
room
it
said
to
me
do
you
know
who
i
am
i
answered
it
said
who
have
you
been
thinking
of
this
evening
i
answered
my
the
whisper
said
i
am
your
oh
mother
command
the
light
to
come
back
show
yourself
to
me
why
not
my
face
was
hidden
when
i
passed
from
life
to
death
my
face
no
mortal
creature
may
oh
mother
touch
me
kiss
me
why
not
my
touch
is
poison
my
kiss
is
the
sense
of
fear
began
to
come
to
me
now
i
moved
my
head
away
on
the
pillow
the
whisper
followed
my
movement
leave
me
i
said
you
are
an
evil
the
whisper
answered
i
am
your
you
come
to
tempt
i
come
to
harden
your
heart
daughter
of
mine
whose
blood
is
cool
daughter
of
mine
who
tamely
submits
you
have
loved
is
it
true
it
is
the
man
you
loved
has
deserted
you
is
it
true
it
is
a
woman
has
lured
him
away
to
herself
a
woman
has
had
no
mercy
on
you
or
on
him
is
it
true
it
is
if
she
lives
what
crime
toward
you
will
she
commit
next
if
she
lives
she
will
marry
will
you
let
her
live
have
i
hardened
your
heart
against
her
will
you
kill
her
show
me
there
was
a
sudden
silence
i
was
still
left
in
the
darkness
feeling
nothing
hearing
nothing
even
the
consciousness
that
i
was
lying
on
my
bed
deserted
me
i
had
no
idea
that
i
was
in
the
bedroom
i
had
no
knowledge
of
where
i
was
the
ghastly
light
that
i
had
seen
already
dawned
on
me
once
more
i
was
no
longer
in
my
bed
no
longer
in
my
room
no
longer
in
the
house
without
wonder
without
even
a
feeling
of
surprise
i
looked
round
the
place
was
familiar
to
me
i
was
alone
in
the
museum
of
our
town
the
light
flowed
along
in
front
of
me
i
followed
from
room
to
room
in
the
museum
where
the
light
led
first
through
the
hung
with
the
works
of
modern
masters
then
through
the
room
filled
with
specimens
of
stuffed
animals
the
lion
and
the
tiger
the
vulture
of
the
alps
and
the
great
albatross
looked
like
living
creatures
threatening
me
in
the
supernatural
light
i
entered
the
third
room
devoted
to
the
exhibition
of
ancient
armor
and
the
weapons
of
all
nations
here
the
light
rose
higher
and
leaving
me
in
darkness
where
i
stood
showed
a
collection
of
swords
daggers
and
knives
arranged
on
the
wall
in
imitation
of
the
form
of
a
star
the
whisper
sounded
again
close
at
my
ear
it
echoed
my
own
thought
when
i
called
to
mind
the
ways
of
killing
which
history
had
taught
me
it
said
kill
her
with
the
no
my
heart
failed
me
when
i
thought
of
the
blood
i
hid
the
dreadful
weapons
from
my
view
i
cried
out
let
me
go
let
me
go
again
i
was
lost
in
darkness
again
i
had
no
knowledge
in
me
of
where
i
was
again
after
an
interval
the
light
showed
me
the
new
place
in
which
i
stood
i
was
alone
in
the
of
our
parish
church
the
light
led
me
on
among
the
graves
to
the
lonely
corner
in
which
the
great
yew
tree
stands
and
rising
higher
revealed
the
solemn
foliage
brightened
by
the
fatal
red
fruit
which
hides
in
itself
the
seeds
of
death
the
whisper
tempted
me
again
it
followed
again
the
train
of
my
own
thought
it
said
kill
her
by
no
revenge
by
poison
steals
its
way
to
its
end
the
base
deceitfulness
of
helena
s
crime
against
me
seemed
to
call
for
a
day
of
reckoning
that
hid
itself
under
no
disguise
i
raised
my
cry
to
be
delivered
from
the
sight
of
the
deadly
tree
the
changes
which
i
have
tried
to
describe
followed
once
more
the
confession
of
what
i
felt
the
darkness
was
dispelled
for
the
third
time
i
was
standing
in
helena
s
room
looking
at
her
as
she
lay
asleep
in
her
bed
she
was
quite
still
now
but
she
must
have
been
restless
at
some
earlier
time
the
bedclothes
were
disordered
her
head
had
sunk
so
low
that
the
pillow
rose
high
and
vacant
above
her
there
colored
by
a
tender
flush
of
sleep
was
the
face
whose
beauty
put
my
poor
face
to
shame
there
was
the
sister
who
had
committed
the
worst
of
murders
the
wretch
who
had
killed
in
me
all
that
made
life
worth
having
while
that
thought
was
in
my
mind
i
heard
the
whisper
again
kill
her
openly
the
tempter
mother
said
kill
her
daringly
faint
heart
do
you
still
want
courage
rouse
your
spirit
look
see
yourself
in
the
act
the
temptation
took
a
form
which
now
tried
me
for
the
first
time
as
if
a
mirror
had
reflected
the
scene
i
saw
myself
standing
by
the
bedside
with
the
pillow
that
was
to
smother
the
sleeper
in
my
hands
i
heard
the
whispering
voice
telling
me
how
to
speak
the
words
that
warned
and
condemned
her
wake
you
who
have
taken
him
from
me
wake
and
meet
your
i
saw
her
start
up
in
bed
the
sudden
movement
disordered
the
nightdress
over
her
bosom
and
showed
the
miniature
portrait
of
a
man
hung
round
her
neck
the
man
was
philip
the
likeness
was
looking
at
me
so
dear
so
lovely
those
eyes
that
had
once
been
the
light
of
my
heart
mourned
for
me
and
judged
me
now
they
saw
the
guilty
thought
that
polluted
me
they
brought
me
to
my
knees
imploring
him
to
help
me
back
to
my
better
self
one
last
mercy
dear
to
comfort
me
under
the
loss
of
you
let
the
love
that
was
once
my
life
be
my
good
angel
still
save
me
philip
even
though
you
forsake
me
save
me
from
myself
there
was
a
sudden
cry
the
agony
of
it
pierced
my
brain
drove
away
the
ghastly
light
silenced
the
tempting
whispers
i
came
to
myself
i
saw
and
not
in
a
dream
helena
started
up
in
her
bed
that
cry
of
terror
at
the
sight
of
me
in
her
room
at
night
burst
from
her
lips
the
miniature
of
philip
hung
round
her
neck
a
visible
reality
though
my
head
was
dizzy
though
my
heart
was
sinking
i
had
not
lost
my
senses
yet
all
that
the
night
lamp
could
show
me
i
still
saw
and
i
heard
the
sound
faintly
when
the
door
of
the
was
opened
alarmed
by
that
piercing
cry
my
father
came
hurrying
into
the
room
not
a
word
passed
between
us
three
the
whispers
that
i
had
heard
were
wicked
the
thoughts
that
had
been
in
my
mind
were
vile
had
they
left
some
poison
in
the
air
of
the
room
which
killed
the
words
on
our
lips
my
father
looked
at
helena
with
a
trembling
hand
she
pointed
to
me
he
put
his
arm
round
me
and
held
me
up
i
remember
his
leading
me
away
and
i
remember
nothing
more
my
last
words
are
written
i
lock
up
this
journal
of
i
hope
and
pray
to
open
it
again
second
period
continued
events
in
the
family
related
by
the
governor
chapter
xxxii
the
lady
in
the
year
i
found
myself
compelled
to
submit
to
the
demands
of
two
hard
advancing
age
and
failing
health
reminded
the
governor
of
the
prison
of
his
duty
to
his
successor
in
one
unanswerable
word
resign
when
they
have
employed
us
and
interested
us
for
the
greater
part
of
our
lives
we
bid
farewell
to
our
duties
even
to
the
gloomy
duties
of
a
prison
with
a
sense
of
regret
my
view
of
the
future
presented
a
vacant
prospect
indeed
when
i
looked
at
my
idle
life
to
come
and
wondered
what
i
should
do
with
it
loose
on
the
world
at
my
age
i
drifted
into
domestic
refuge
under
the
care
of
my
two
dear
and
good
sons
after
a
while
never
mind
how
long
a
while
i
began
to
grow
restless
under
the
heavy
burden
of
idleness
having
nothing
else
to
complain
of
i
complained
of
my
health
and
consulted
a
doctor
that
sagacious
man
hit
on
the
right
way
of
getting
rid
of
me
he
recommended
traveling
this
was
unexpected
advice
after
some
hesitation
i
accepted
it
reluctantly
the
instincts
of
age
recoil
from
making
new
acquaintances
contemplating
new
places
and
adopting
new
habits
besides
i
hate
railway
traveling
however
i
contrived
to
get
as
far
as
italy
and
stopped
to
rest
at
florence
here
i
found
pictures
by
the
old
masters
that
i
could
really
enjoy
a
public
park
that
i
could
honestly
admire
and
an
excellent
friend
and
colleague
of
former
days
once
chaplain
to
the
prison
now
clergyman
in
charge
of
the
english
church
we
met
in
the
gallery
of
the
pitti
palace
and
he
recognized
me
immediately
i
was
pleased
to
find
that
the
lapse
of
years
had
made
so
little
difference
in
my
personal
appearance
the
traveler
who
advances
as
far
as
florence
and
does
not
go
on
to
rome
must
be
regardless
indeed
of
the
opinions
of
his
friends
let
me
not
attempt
to
conceal
it
i
am
that
insensible
traveler
over
and
over
again
i
said
to
myself
rome
must
be
done
and
over
and
over
again
i
put
off
doing
it
to
own
the
truth
the
fascinations
of
florence
aided
by
the
society
of
my
friend
laid
so
strong
a
hold
on
me
that
i
believe
i
should
have
ended
my
days
in
the
delightful
italian
city
but
for
the
dangerous
illness
of
one
of
my
sons
this
misfortune
hurried
me
back
to
england
in
dread
every
step
of
the
way
of
finding
that
i
had
arrived
too
late
the
journey
thank
god
proved
to
have
been
taken
without
need
my
son
was
no
longer
in
danger
when
i
reached
london
in
the
year
at
that
date
i
was
near
enough
to
the
customary
limit
of
human
life
to
feel
the
necessity
of
rest
and
quiet
in
other
words
my
days
of
travel
had
come
to
their
end
having
established
myself
in
my
own
country
i
did
not
forget
to
let
old
friends
know
where
they
might
find
me
among
those
to
whom
i
wrote
was
another
colleague
of
past
years
who
still
held
his
medical
appointment
in
the
prison
when
i
received
the
doctor
s
reply
it
inclosed
a
letter
directed
to
me
at
my
old
quarters
in
the
governor
s
rooms
who
could
possibly
have
sent
a
letter
to
an
address
which
i
had
left
five
years
since
my
correspondent
proved
to
be
no
less
a
person
than
the
congregational
minister
the
friend
whom
i
had
estranged
from
me
by
the
tone
in
which
i
had
written
to
him
on
the
occasion
of
his
wife
s
death
it
was
a
distressing
letter
to
read
i
beg
permission
to
give
only
the
substance
of
it
in
this
place
entreating
me
with
touching
expressions
of
humility
and
sorrow
to
forgive
his
long
silence
the
writer
appealed
to
my
friendly
remembrance
of
him
he
was
in
sore
need
of
counsel
under
serious
difficulties
and
i
was
the
only
person
to
whom
he
could
apply
for
help
in
the
disordered
state
of
his
health
at
that
time
he
ventured
to
hope
that
i
would
visit
him
at
his
present
place
of
abode
and
would
let
him
have
the
happiness
of
seeing
me
as
speedily
as
possible
he
concluded
with
this
extraordinary
postscript
when
you
see
my
daughters
say
nothing
to
either
of
them
which
relates
in
any
way
to
the
subject
of
their
ages
you
shall
hear
why
when
we
the
reading
of
this
letter
naturally
reminded
me
of
the
claims
which
my
friend
s
noble
conduct
had
established
on
my
admiration
and
respect
at
the
past
time
when
we
met
in
the
prison
i
could
not
hesitate
to
grant
his
request
strangely
as
it
was
expressed
and
doubtful
as
the
prospect
appeared
to
be
of
my
answering
the
expectations
which
he
had
founded
on
the
renewal
of
our
intercourse
answering
his
letter
by
telegraph
i
promised
to
be
with
him
on
the
next
day
on
arriving
at
the
station
i
found
that
i
was
the
only
traveler
by
a
carriage
who
left
the
train
a
young
lady
remarkable
by
her
good
looks
and
good
dressing
seemed
to
have
noticed
this
trifling
circumstance
she
approached
me
with
a
ready
smile
i
believe
i
am
speaking
to
my
father
s
friend
she
said
my
name
is
helena
here
was
one
of
the
minister
s
two
daughters
and
that
one
of
the
two
as
i
discovered
the
moment
i
shook
hands
with
her
who
was
my
friend
s
own
child
miss
helena
recalled
to
me
her
mother
s
face
infinitely
improved
by
youth
and
health
and
by
a
natural
beauty
which
that
cruel
and
deceitful
woman
could
never
have
possessed
the
slanting
forehead
and
the
shifting
flashing
eyes
that
i
recollected
in
the
parent
were
reproduced
slightly
reproduced
i
ought
to
say
in
the
child
as
for
the
other
features
i
had
never
seen
a
more
beautiful
nose
and
mouth
or
a
more
outline
than
was
presented
by
the
lower
part
of
the
face
but
miss
helena
somehow
failed
to
charm
me
i
doubt
if
i
should
have
fallen
in
love
with
her
even
in
the
days
when
i
was
a
foolish
young
man
the
first
question
that
i
put
as
we
drove
from
the
station
to
the
house
related
naturally
to
her
father
he
is
very
ill
she
began
i
am
afraid
you
must
prepare
yourself
to
see
a
sad
change
nerves
the
mischief
first
showed
itself
the
doctor
tells
us
in
derangement
of
his
nervous
system
he
has
been
i
regret
to
tell
you
obstinate
in
refusing
to
give
up
his
preaching
and
pastoral
work
he
ought
to
have
tried
rest
at
the
seaside
things
have
gone
on
from
bad
to
worse
last
sunday
at
the
beginning
of
his
sermon
he
broke
down
very
very
sad
is
it
not
the
doctor
says
that
precious
time
has
been
lost
and
he
must
make
up
his
mind
to
resign
his
charge
he
won
t
hear
of
it
you
are
his
old
friend
please
try
to
persuade
fluently
spoken
the
words
well
chosen
the
melodious
voice
reminding
me
of
the
late
gracedieu
s
advantages
in
that
respect
little
sighs
judiciously
thrown
in
here
and
there
just
at
the
right
places
everything
let
me
own
that
could
present
a
dutiful
daughter
as
a
pattern
of
propriety
and
nothing
let
me
add
that
could
produce
an
impression
on
my
insensible
temperament
if
i
had
not
been
too
discreet
to
rush
at
a
hasty
conclusion
i
might
have
been
inclined
to
say
her
mother
s
child
every
inch
of
her
the
interest
which
i
was
still
able
to
feel
in
my
friend
s
domestic
affairs
centered
in
the
daughter
whom
he
had
adopted
in
her
infancy
i
had
seen
the
child
and
liked
her
i
was
the
one
person
living
since
the
death
of
gracedieu
who
knew
how
the
minister
had
concealed
the
sad
secret
of
her
parentage
and
i
wanted
to
discover
if
the
hereditary
taint
had
begun
to
show
itself
in
the
innocent
offspring
of
the
murderess
just
as
i
was
considering
how
i
might
harmlessly
speak
of
miss
helena
s
sister
miss
helena
herself
introduced
the
subject
may
i
ask
she
resumed
if
you
were
disappointed
when
you
found
nobody
but
me
to
meet
you
at
our
station
here
was
an
opportunity
of
paying
her
a
compliment
if
i
had
been
a
younger
man
or
if
she
had
produced
a
favorable
impression
on
me
as
it
was
i
hit
if
i
may
praise
myself
on
an
ingenious
compromise
what
excuse
could
i
have
i
asked
for
feeling
disappointed
well
i
hear
you
are
an
official
personage
i
ought
to
say
perhaps
a
retired
official
personage
we
might
have
received
you
more
respectfully
if
my
father
s
daughters
had
been
present
at
the
station
it
s
not
my
fault
that
my
sister
was
not
with
the
tone
in
which
she
said
this
strengthened
my
prejudice
against
her
it
told
me
that
the
two
girls
were
living
together
on
no
very
friendly
terms
and
it
suggested
justly
or
unjustly
i
could
not
then
decide
that
miss
helena
was
to
blame
my
sister
is
away
from
surely
miss
helena
that
is
a
good
reason
for
her
not
coming
to
meet
me
i
beg
your
pardon
it
is
a
bad
reason
she
has
been
sent
away
for
the
recovery
of
her
health
and
the
loss
of
her
health
is
entirely
her
own
what
did
this
matter
to
me
i
decided
on
dropping
the
subject
my
memory
reverted
however
to
past
occasions
on
which
the
loss
of
health
had
been
entirely
my
own
fault
there
was
something
in
these
personal
recollections
which
encouraged
my
perverse
tendency
to
sympathize
with
a
young
lady
to
whom
i
had
not
yet
been
introduced
the
young
lady
s
sister
appeared
to
be
discouraged
by
my
silence
she
said
i
hope
you
don
t
think
the
worse
of
me
for
what
i
have
just
mentioned
certainly
perhaps
you
will
fail
to
see
any
need
of
my
speaking
of
my
sister
at
all
will
you
kindly
listen
if
i
try
to
explain
myself
with
she
slyly
set
the
best
construction
on
my
perfectly
commonplace
reply
thank
you
she
said
the
fact
is
my
father
i
can
t
imagine
why
wishes
you
to
see
my
sister
as
well
as
me
he
has
written
to
the
farmhouse
at
which
she
is
now
staying
to
tell
her
to
come
home
it
is
possible
if
your
kindness
offers
me
an
opportunity
that
i
may
ask
to
be
guided
by
your
experience
in
a
little
matter
which
interests
me
my
sister
is
rash
and
reckless
and
has
a
terrible
temper
i
should
be
very
sorry
indeed
if
you
were
induced
to
form
an
unfavorable
opinion
of
me
from
anything
you
might
notice
if
you
see
us
together
you
understand
me
i
hope
i
quite
understand
to
set
me
against
her
sister
in
her
own
private
interests
there
as
i
felt
sure
was
the
motive
under
which
she
was
acting
as
hard
as
her
mother
as
selfish
as
her
mother
and
judging
from
those
two
bad
qualities
probably
as
cruel
as
her
mother
that
was
how
i
understood
miss
helena
gracedieu
when
our
carriage
drew
up
at
her
father
s
house
a
lady
was
on
the
doorstep
when
we
arrived
just
ringing
the
bell
she
looked
round
at
us
both
being
evidently
as
complete
a
stranger
to
my
fair
companion
as
she
was
to
me
when
the
servant
opened
the
door
she
said
is
miss
jillgall
at
home
at
the
sound
of
that
odd
name
miss
helena
tossed
her
head
disdainfully
she
took
no
sort
of
notice
of
the
who
was
at
the
door
of
her
father
s
house
this
young
person
s
contempt
for
miss
jillgall
appeared
to
extend
to
miss
jillgall
s
friends
in
the
meantime
the
servant
s
answer
was
not
at
the
middle
aged
lady
said
do
you
expect
her
back
soon
yes
ma
i
will
call
again
later
in
the
what
name
if
you
please
the
lady
stole
another
look
at
me
before
she
replied
never
mind
the
name
she
said
and
walked
away
chapter
xxxiii
the
minister
s
misfortune
do
you
know
that
lady
miss
helena
asked
as
we
entered
the
house
she
is
a
perfect
stranger
to
me
i
answered
are
you
sure
you
have
not
forgotten
her
why
do
you
think
i
have
forgotten
her
because
she
evidently
remembered
the
lady
had
no
doubt
looked
at
me
twice
if
this
meant
that
my
face
was
familiar
to
her
i
could
only
repeat
what
i
have
already
said
never
to
my
knowledge
had
i
seen
her
before
leading
the
way
upstairs
miss
helena
apologized
for
taking
me
into
her
father
s
bedroom
he
is
able
to
sit
up
in
an
armchair
she
said
and
he
might
do
more
as
i
think
if
he
would
exert
himself
he
won
t
exert
himself
very
sad
would
you
like
to
look
at
your
room
before
you
see
my
father
it
is
quite
ready
for
you
we
hope
she
favored
me
with
a
fascinating
smile
devoted
to
winning
my
heart
when
her
interests
required
it
we
hope
you
will
pay
us
a
long
visit
we
look
on
you
as
one
of
i
thanked
her
and
said
i
would
shake
hands
with
my
old
friend
before
i
went
to
my
room
we
parted
at
the
bedroom
door
it
is
out
of
my
power
to
describe
the
shock
that
overpowered
me
when
i
first
saw
the
minister
again
after
the
long
interval
of
time
that
had
separated
us
nothing
that
his
daughter
said
nothing
that
i
myself
anticipated
had
prepared
me
for
that
lamentable
change
for
the
moment
i
was
not
sufficiently
master
of
myself
to
be
able
to
speak
to
him
he
added
to
my
embarrassment
by
the
humility
of
his
manner
and
the
formal
elaboration
of
his
apologies
i
feel
painfully
that
i
have
taken
a
liberty
with
you
he
said
after
the
long
estrangement
between
us
for
which
my
want
of
christian
forbearance
is
to
blame
forgive
it
sir
and
forget
it
i
hope
to
show
that
necessity
justifies
my
presumption
in
subjecting
you
to
a
wearisome
journey
for
my
beginning
to
recover
myself
i
begged
that
he
would
make
no
more
excuses
my
interruption
seemed
to
confuse
him
i
wished
to
say
he
went
on
that
you
are
the
one
man
who
can
understand
me
there
is
my
only
reason
for
asking
to
see
you
and
looking
forward
as
i
do
to
your
advice
you
remember
the
night
or
was
it
the
day
before
that
miserable
woman
was
hanged
you
were
the
only
person
present
when
i
agreed
to
adopt
the
poor
little
creature
stained
already
one
may
say
by
its
mother
s
infamy
i
think
your
wisdom
foresaw
what
a
terrible
responsibility
i
was
undertaking
you
tried
to
prevent
it
well
well
you
have
been
in
my
confidence
you
only
mind
nobody
in
this
house
knows
that
one
of
the
two
girls
is
not
really
my
daughter
pray
stop
me
if
you
find
me
wandering
from
the
point
my
wish
is
to
show
that
you
are
the
only
man
i
can
open
my
heart
to
she
he
paused
as
if
in
search
of
a
lost
idea
and
left
the
sentence
uncompleted
yes
he
went
on
i
was
thinking
of
my
adopted
child
did
i
ever
tell
you
that
i
baptized
her
myself
and
by
a
good
scripture
name
too
eunice
ah
sir
that
little
helpless
baby
is
a
girl
now
of
an
age
to
inspire
love
and
to
feel
love
i
blush
to
acknowledge
it
i
have
behaved
with
a
want
of
with
a
cowardly
no
i
am
indeed
wandering
this
time
i
ought
to
have
told
you
first
that
i
have
been
brought
face
to
face
with
the
possibility
of
eunice
s
marriage
and
to
make
it
worse
still
i
can
t
help
liking
the
young
man
he
comes
of
a
good
family
excellent
manners
highly
educated
plenty
of
money
a
gentleman
in
every
sense
of
the
word
and
poor
little
eunice
is
so
fond
of
him
isn
t
it
dreadful
to
be
obliged
to
check
her
philip
the
young
gentleman
s
name
is
philip
do
you
like
the
name
i
say
i
am
obliged
to
cheek
her
sweetheart
in
the
rudest
manner
when
all
he
wants
to
do
is
to
ask
me
modestly
for
my
sweet
eunice
s
hand
oh
what
have
i
not
suffered
without
a
word
of
sympathy
to
comfort
me
before
i
had
courage
enough
to
write
to
you
shall
i
make
a
dreadful
confession
if
my
religious
convictions
had
not
stood
in
my
way
i
believe
i
should
have
committed
suicide
put
yourself
in
my
place
try
to
see
yourself
shrinking
from
a
necessary
explanation
when
the
happiness
of
a
harmless
girl
so
dutiful
so
affectionate
depended
on
a
word
of
kindness
from
your
lips
and
that
word
you
are
afraid
to
speak
don
t
take
offense
sir
i
mean
myself
not
you
why
don
t
you
say
something
he
burst
out
fiercely
incapable
of
perceiving
that
he
had
allowed
me
no
opportunity
of
speaking
to
him
good
god
don
t
you
understand
me
after
all
the
signs
of
mental
confusion
in
his
talk
had
so
distressed
me
that
i
had
not
been
composed
enough
to
feel
sure
of
what
he
really
meant
until
he
described
himself
as
shrinking
from
a
necessary
hearing
those
words
my
knowledge
of
the
circumstances
helped
me
i
realized
what
his
situation
really
was
compose
yourself
i
said
i
understand
you
at
he
had
suddenly
become
distrustful
prove
it
he
muttered
with
a
furtive
look
at
me
i
want
to
be
satisfied
that
you
understand
my
this
is
your
position
i
told
him
you
are
placed
between
two
deplorable
alternatives
if
you
tell
this
young
gentleman
that
miss
eunice
s
mother
was
a
criminal
hanged
for
murder
his
family
even
if
he
himself
doesn
t
recoil
from
it
will
unquestionably
forbid
the
marriage
and
your
adopted
daughter
s
happiness
will
be
the
true
he
said
frightfully
true
go
if
on
the
other
hand
you
sanction
the
marriage
and
conceal
the
truth
you
commit
a
deliberate
act
of
deceit
and
you
leave
the
lives
of
the
young
couple
at
the
mercy
of
a
possible
discovery
which
might
part
husband
and
wife
cast
a
slur
on
their
children
and
break
up
the
he
shuddered
while
he
listened
to
me
come
to
the
end
of
it
he
cried
i
had
no
more
to
say
and
i
was
obliged
to
answer
him
to
that
effect
no
more
to
say
he
replied
you
have
not
told
me
yet
what
i
most
want
to
i
did
a
rash
thing
i
asked
what
it
was
that
he
most
wanted
to
know
can
t
you
see
it
for
yourself
he
demanded
indignantly
suppose
you
were
put
between
those
two
alternatives
which
you
mentioned
just
well
what
would
you
do
sir
in
my
place
would
you
own
the
disgraceful
truth
before
the
marriage
or
run
the
risk
and
keep
the
horrid
story
to
yourself
either
way
my
reply
might
lead
to
serious
consequences
i
hesitated
he
threatened
me
with
his
poor
feeble
hand
it
was
only
the
anger
of
a
moment
his
humor
changed
to
supplication
he
reminded
me
piteously
of
bygone
days
you
used
to
be
a
man
has
age
hardened
you
have
you
no
pity
left
for
your
old
friend
my
poor
heart
is
sadly
in
want
of
a
word
of
wisdom
spoken
who
could
have
resisted
this
i
took
his
hand
be
at
ease
dear
minister
in
your
place
i
should
run
the
risk
and
keep
that
horrid
story
to
he
sank
back
gently
in
his
chair
oh
the
relief
of
it
he
said
how
can
i
thank
you
as
i
ought
for
quieting
my
mind
i
seized
the
opportunity
of
quieting
his
mind
to
good
purpose
by
suggesting
a
change
of
subject
let
us
have
done
with
serious
talk
for
the
present
i
proposed
i
have
been
an
idle
man
for
the
last
five
years
and
i
want
to
tell
you
about
my
his
attention
began
to
wander
he
evidently
felt
no
interest
in
my
travels
are
you
sure
he
asked
anxiously
that
we
have
said
all
we
ought
to
say
no
he
cried
answering
his
own
question
i
believe
i
have
forgotten
something
i
am
certain
i
have
forgotten
something
perhaps
i
mentioned
it
in
the
letter
i
wrote
to
you
have
you
got
my
letter
i
showed
it
to
him
he
read
the
letter
and
gave
it
back
to
me
with
a
heavy
sigh
not
there
he
said
despairingly
not
there
is
the
lost
remembrance
connected
with
anybody
in
the
house
i
asked
trying
to
help
him
does
it
relate
by
any
chance
to
one
of
the
young
ladies
you
wonderful
man
nothing
escapes
you
yes
the
thing
i
have
forgotten
concerns
one
of
the
girls
stop
let
me
get
at
it
by
myself
surely
it
relates
to
helena
he
hesitated
his
face
clouded
over
with
an
expression
of
anxious
thought
yes
it
relates
to
helena
he
repeated
but
how
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
i
am
ashamed
of
my
weakness
he
said
faintly
you
don
t
know
how
dreadful
it
is
to
forget
things
in
this
the
injury
that
his
mind
had
sustained
now
assumed
an
aspect
that
was
serious
indeed
the
subtle
machinery
which
stimulates
the
memory
by
means
of
the
association
of
ideas
appeared
to
have
lost
its
working
power
in
the
intellect
of
this
unhappy
man
i
made
the
first
suggestion
that
occurred
to
me
rather
than
add
to
his
distress
by
remaining
silent
if
we
talk
of
your
daughter
i
said
the
merest
accident
a
word
spoken
at
random
by
you
or
me
may
be
all
your
memory
wants
to
rouse
he
agreed
eagerly
to
this
yes
yes
let
me
begin
helena
met
you
i
think
at
the
station
of
course
i
remember
that
it
only
happened
a
few
hours
since
well
he
went
on
with
a
change
in
his
manner
to
parental
pride
which
it
was
pleasant
to
see
did
you
think
my
daughter
a
fine
girl
i
hope
helena
didn
t
disappoint
you
quite
the
having
made
that
necessary
reply
i
saw
my
way
to
keeping
his
mind
occupied
by
a
harmless
subject
it
must
however
be
owned
i
went
on
that
your
daughter
surprised
in
what
way
when
she
mentioned
her
name
who
could
have
supposed
that
you
an
inveterate
enemy
to
the
roman
catholic
church
would
have
christened
your
daughter
by
the
name
of
a
roman
catholic
saint
he
listened
to
this
with
a
smile
had
i
happily
blundered
on
some
association
which
his
mind
was
still
able
to
pursue
you
happen
to
be
wrong
this
time
he
said
pleasantly
i
never
gave
my
girl
the
name
of
helena
and
what
is
more
i
never
baptized
her
you
ought
to
know
that
years
and
years
ago
i
wrote
to
tell
you
that
my
poor
wife
had
made
me
a
proud
and
happy
father
and
surely
i
said
that
the
child
was
born
while
she
was
on
a
visit
to
her
brother
s
rectory
do
you
remember
the
name
of
the
place
i
told
you
it
was
a
remote
little
village
called
suppose
we
put
memory
to
a
test
can
you
remember
the
name
he
asked
with
a
momentary
appearance
of
triumph
showing
itself
poor
fellow
in
his
face
after
the
time
that
had
elapsed
the
name
had
slipped
my
memory
when
i
confessed
this
he
exulted
over
me
with
an
unalloyed
pleasure
which
it
was
cheering
to
see
memory
is
failing
you
now
he
said
the
name
is
long
lanes
and
what
do
you
think
my
wife
did
this
is
so
characteristic
of
her
when
i
presented
myself
at
her
bedside
instead
of
speaking
of
our
own
baby
she
reminded
me
of
the
name
that
i
had
given
to
our
adopted
daughter
when
i
baptized
the
child
you
chose
the
ugliest
name
that
a
girl
can
have
she
said
i
begged
her
to
remember
that
eunice
was
a
name
in
scripture
she
persisted
in
spite
of
me
what
firmness
of
character
i
detest
the
name
of
eunice
she
said
and
now
that
i
have
a
girl
of
my
own
it
s
my
turn
to
choose
the
name
i
claim
it
as
my
she
was
beginning
to
get
excited
i
allowed
her
to
have
her
own
way
of
course
only
let
me
know
i
said
what
the
name
is
to
be
when
you
have
thought
of
my
dear
sir
she
had
the
name
ready
without
thinking
about
it
my
baby
shall
be
called
by
the
name
that
is
sweetest
in
my
ears
the
name
of
my
dear
lost
we
had
what
shall
i
call
it
a
slight
difference
of
opinion
when
i
heard
that
the
name
was
to
be
helena
i
really
could
reconcile
it
to
my
conscience
to
baptize
a
child
of
mine
by
the
name
of
a
popish
saint
my
wife
s
brother
set
things
right
between
us
a
worthy
good
man
he
died
not
very
long
ago
i
forget
the
date
not
to
detain
you
any
longer
the
rector
of
long
lanes
baptized
our
daughter
that
is
how
she
comes
by
her
name
and
so
it
happens
that
her
birth
is
registered
in
a
village
which
her
father
has
never
inhabited
i
hope
sir
you
think
a
little
better
of
my
memory
now
i
was
afraid
to
tell
him
what
i
really
did
think
he
was
not
fifty
years
old
yet
and
he
had
just
exhibited
one
of
the
sad
symptoms
which
mark
the
broken
memory
of
old
age
lead
him
back
to
the
events
of
many
years
ago
and
as
he
had
just
proved
to
me
he
could
remember
well
and
relate
coherently
but
let
him
attempt
to
recall
circumstances
which
had
only
taken
place
a
short
time
since
and
forgetfulness
and
confusion
presented
the
lamentable
result
just
as
i
have
related
it
the
effort
that
he
had
made
the
agitation
that
he
had
undergone
in
talking
to
me
had
confirmed
my
fears
that
he
would
overtask
his
wasted
strength
he
lay
back
in
his
chair
let
us
go
on
with
our
conversation
he
murmured
we
haven
t
recovered
what
i
had
forgotten
his
eyes
closed
and
opened
again
languidly
there
was
something
i
wanted
to
recall
he
resumed
and
you
were
helping
his
weak
voice
died
away
his
weary
eyes
closed
again
after
waiting
until
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
he
was
resting
peacefully
in
sleep
i
left
the
room
chapter
xxxiv
the
lively
old
maid
a
perfect
stranger
to
the
interior
of
the
house
seeing
that
my
experience
began
and
ended
with
the
minister
s
bedchamber
i
descended
the
stairs
in
the
character
of
a
guest
in
search
of
domestic
information
on
my
way
down
i
heard
the
door
of
a
room
on
the
ground
floor
opened
and
a
woman
s
voice
below
speaking
in
a
hurry
my
dear
i
have
not
a
moment
to
spare
my
patients
are
waiting
for
this
was
followed
by
a
confidential
communication
judging
by
the
tone
mind
not
a
word
about
me
to
that
old
gentleman
her
patients
were
waiting
for
her
had
i
discovered
a
female
doctor
and
there
was
some
old
gentleman
whom
she
was
not
willing
to
trust
surely
i
was
not
that
man
reaching
the
hall
just
as
the
lady
said
her
last
words
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
face
and
discovered
the
stranger
who
had
called
on
miss
jillgall
and
had
promised
to
repeat
her
visit
a
second
lady
was
at
the
door
with
her
back
to
me
taking
leave
of
her
friend
having
said
she
turned
round
and
we
confronted
each
other
i
found
her
to
be
a
little
person
wiry
and
active
past
the
prime
of
life
and
ugly
enough
to
encourage
prejudice
in
persons
who
take
a
superficial
view
of
their
looking
impartially
at
the
little
sunken
eyes
which
rested
on
me
with
a
comical
expression
of
embarrassment
i
saw
signs
that
said
there
is
some
good
here
under
a
disagreeable
surface
if
you
can
only
find
it
she
saluted
me
with
a
curtsey
and
threw
open
the
door
of
a
room
on
the
ground
floor
pray
walk
in
sir
and
permit
me
to
introduce
myself
i
am
gracedieu
s
cousin
miss
jillgall
proud
indeed
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
a
gentleman
distinguished
in
the
service
of
his
country
or
perhaps
i
ought
to
say
in
the
service
of
the
law
the
governor
offers
hospitality
to
prisoners
and
who
introduces
prisoners
to
board
and
lodging
with
the
governor
the
law
beautiful
weather
for
the
time
of
year
is
it
not
may
i
ask
have
you
seen
your
room
the
embarrassment
which
i
had
already
noticed
had
extended
by
this
time
to
her
voice
and
her
manner
she
was
evidently
trying
to
talk
herself
into
a
state
of
confidence
it
seemed
but
too
probable
that
i
was
indeed
the
person
mentioned
by
her
prudent
friend
at
the
door
having
acknowledged
that
i
had
not
seen
my
room
yet
my
politeness
attempted
to
add
that
there
was
no
hurry
the
wiry
little
lady
was
of
the
contrary
opinion
she
jumped
out
of
her
chair
as
if
she
had
been
shot
out
of
it
pray
let
me
make
myself
useful
the
dream
of
my
life
is
to
make
myself
useful
to
others
and
to
such
a
man
as
you
i
consider
myself
honored
besides
i
do
enjoy
running
up
and
down
stairs
this
way
dear
sir
this
way
to
your
she
skipped
up
the
stairs
and
stopped
on
the
first
landing
do
you
know
i
am
a
timid
person
though
i
may
not
look
like
it
sometimes
curiosity
gets
the
better
of
me
and
then
i
grow
bold
did
you
notice
a
lady
who
was
taking
leave
of
me
just
now
at
the
house
door
i
replied
that
i
had
seen
the
lady
for
a
moment
but
not
for
the
first
time
just
as
i
arrived
here
from
the
station
i
said
i
found
her
paying
a
visit
when
you
were
not
at
yes
and
do
tell
me
one
thing
my
readiness
in
answering
seemed
to
have
inspired
miss
jillgall
with
confidence
i
heard
no
more
confessions
of
overpowering
curiosity
am
i
right
she
proceeded
in
supposing
that
miss
helena
accompanied
you
on
your
way
here
from
the
station
quite
did
she
say
anything
particular
when
she
saw
the
lady
asking
for
me
at
the
door
miss
helena
thought
i
said
that
the
lady
recognized
me
as
a
person
whom
she
had
seen
and
what
did
you
think
yourself
i
thought
miss
helena
was
very
extraordinary
with
that
remark
miss
jillgall
dropped
the
subject
the
meaning
of
her
reiterated
inquiries
was
now
as
it
seemed
to
me
clear
enough
she
was
eager
to
discover
how
i
could
have
inspired
the
distrust
of
me
expressed
in
the
caution
addressed
to
her
by
her
friend
when
we
reached
the
upper
floor
she
paused
before
the
minister
s
room
i
believe
many
years
have
passed
she
said
since
you
last
saw
gracedieu
i
am
afraid
you
have
found
him
a
sadly
changed
man
you
won
t
be
angry
with
me
i
hope
for
asking
more
questions
i
owe
gracedieu
a
debt
of
gratitude
which
no
devotion
on
my
part
can
ever
repay
you
don
t
know
what
a
favor
i
shall
consider
it
if
you
will
tell
me
what
you
think
of
him
did
it
seem
to
you
that
he
was
not
quite
himself
i
don
t
mean
in
his
looks
poor
dear
i
mean
in
his
there
was
true
sorrow
and
sympathy
in
her
face
i
believe
i
should
hardly
have
thought
her
ugly
if
we
had
first
met
at
that
moment
thus
far
she
had
only
amused
me
i
began
really
to
like
miss
jillgall
now
i
must
not
conceal
from
you
i
replied
that
the
state
of
gracedieu
s
mind
surprised
and
distressed
me
but
i
ought
also
to
tell
you
that
i
saw
him
perhaps
at
his
worst
the
subject
on
which
he
wished
to
speak
with
me
would
have
agitated
any
man
in
his
state
of
health
he
consulted
me
about
his
daughter
s
miss
jillgall
suddenly
turned
pale
his
daughter
s
marriage
she
repeated
oh
you
frighten
me
why
should
i
frighten
you
she
seemed
to
find
some
difficulty
in
expressing
herself
i
hardly
know
how
to
put
it
sir
you
will
excuse
me
won
t
you
if
i
say
what
i
feel
you
have
influence
not
the
sort
of
influence
that
finds
places
for
people
who
don
t
deserve
them
and
gets
mentioned
in
the
newspapers
i
only
mean
influence
over
gracedieu
that
s
what
frightens
me
how
do
i
know
oh
dear
i
m
asking
another
question
allow
me
for
once
to
be
plain
and
positive
i
m
afraid
sir
you
have
encouraged
the
minister
to
consent
to
helena
s
pardon
me
i
answered
you
mean
eunice
s
no
sir
no
madam
what
does
he
mean
said
miss
jillgall
to
herself
i
heard
her
this
is
what
i
mean
i
asserted
in
my
most
positive
manner
the
only
subject
on
which
the
minister
has
consulted
me
is
miss
eunice
s
my
tone
left
her
no
alternative
but
to
believe
me
she
looked
not
only
bewildered
but
alarmed
oh
poor
man
has
he
lost
himself
in
such
a
dreadful
way
as
that
she
said
to
herself
i
daren
t
believe
it
she
turned
to
me
you
have
been
talking
with
him
for
some
time
please
try
to
remember
while
gracedieu
was
speaking
of
euneece
did
he
say
nothing
of
helena
s
infamous
conduct
to
her
sister
not
the
slightest
hint
of
any
such
thing
i
assured
her
had
reached
my
ears
then
she
cried
i
can
tell
you
what
he
has
forgotten
we
kept
as
much
of
that
miserable
story
to
ourselves
as
we
could
in
mercy
to
him
besides
he
was
always
fondest
of
euneece
she
would
live
in
his
memory
when
he
had
forgotten
the
other
the
wretch
the
traitress
the
plotter
the
fiend
miss
jillgall
s
good
manners
slipped
as
it
were
from
under
her
she
clinched
her
fists
as
a
final
means
of
expressing
her
sentiments
the
wretched
english
language
isn
t
half
strong
enough
for
me
she
declared
with
a
look
of
fury
i
took
a
liberty
may
i
ask
what
miss
helena
has
done
i
said
you
ask
oh
heavens
you
must
ask
you
shall
ask
mr
governor
if
your
eyes
are
not
opened
to
helena
s
true
character
i
can
tell
you
what
she
will
do
she
will
deceive
you
into
taking
her
part
do
you
think
she
went
to
the
station
out
of
regard
for
the
great
man
pooh
she
went
with
an
eye
to
her
own
interests
and
she
means
to
make
the
great
man
useful
thank
god
i
can
stop
that
she
checked
herself
there
and
looked
suspiciously
at
the
door
of
gracedieu
s
room
in
the
interest
of
our
conversation
she
whispered
we
have
not
given
a
thought
to
the
place
we
have
been
talking
in
do
you
think
the
minister
has
heard
us
not
if
he
is
asleep
as
i
left
miss
jillgall
shook
her
head
ominously
the
safe
way
is
this
way
she
said
come
with
chapter
xxxv
the
future
looks
gloomy
my
guide
led
me
to
my
room
well
out
of
gracedieu
s
hearing
if
he
happened
to
be
awake
at
the
other
end
of
the
passage
having
opened
the
door
she
paused
on
the
threshold
the
decrees
of
that
merciless
english
despot
propriety
claimed
her
for
their
own
oh
dear
she
said
to
herself
ought
i
to
go
in
my
interest
as
a
man
and
what
is
more
an
old
man
in
the
coming
disclosure
was
too
serious
to
be
trifled
with
in
this
way
i
took
her
arm
and
led
her
into
my
room
as
if
i
was
at
a
leading
her
to
the
table
is
it
the
good
or
the
evil
fortune
of
mortals
that
the
comic
side
of
life
and
the
serious
side
of
life
are
perpetually
in
collision
with
each
other
we
burst
out
laughing
at
a
moment
of
grave
importance
to
us
both
perfectly
inappropriate
and
perfectly
natural
but
we
were
neither
of
us
philosophers
and
we
were
ashamed
of
our
own
merriment
the
moment
it
had
ceased
when
you
hear
what
i
have
to
tell
you
miss
jillgall
began
i
hope
you
will
think
as
i
do
what
has
slipped
gracedieu
s
memory
it
may
be
safer
to
say
for
he
is
sometimes
irritable
poor
dear
where
he
won
t
know
anything
about
with
that
she
told
the
lamentable
story
of
the
desertion
of
eunice
in
silence
i
listened
from
first
to
last
how
could
i
trust
myself
to
speak
as
i
must
have
spoken
in
the
presence
of
a
woman
the
cruel
injury
inflicted
on
the
poor
girl
who
had
interested
and
touched
me
in
the
first
innocent
year
of
her
life
who
had
grown
to
womanhood
to
be
the
victim
of
two
wretches
both
trusted
by
her
both
bound
to
her
by
the
sacred
debt
of
love
so
fired
my
temper
that
i
longed
to
be
within
reach
of
the
man
with
a
horsewhip
in
my
hand
seeing
in
my
face
as
i
suppose
what
was
passing
in
my
mind
miss
jillgall
expressed
sympathy
and
admiration
in
her
own
quaint
way
ah
i
like
to
see
you
so
angry
it
s
grand
to
know
that
a
man
who
has
governed
prisoners
has
got
such
a
pitying
heart
let
me
tell
you
one
thing
sir
you
will
be
more
angry
than
ever
when
you
see
my
sweet
girl
and
mind
this
it
is
helena
s
devouring
vanity
helena
s
wicked
jealousy
of
her
sister
s
good
fortune
that
has
done
the
mischief
don
t
be
too
hard
on
philip
i
do
believe
if
the
truth
was
told
he
is
ashamed
of
i
felt
inclined
to
be
harder
on
philip
than
ever
where
is
he
i
asked
miss
jillgall
started
oh
mr
governor
don
t
show
the
severe
side
of
yourself
after
the
pretty
compliment
i
have
just
paid
to
you
what
a
masterful
voice
and
what
eyes
dear
sir
what
terrifying
eyes
i
feel
as
if
i
was
one
of
your
prisoners
and
had
misbehaved
i
repeated
my
question
with
improvement
i
hope
in
my
looks
and
tones
don
t
think
me
obstinate
my
dear
lady
i
only
want
to
know
if
he
is
in
this
miss
jillgall
seemed
to
take
a
curious
pleasure
in
disappointing
me
she
had
not
forgotten
my
unfortunate
abruptness
of
look
and
manner
you
won
t
find
him
here
she
said
perhaps
he
has
left
england
if
you
must
know
sir
he
is
in
london
with
the
name
startled
me
in
a
moment
more
it
recalled
to
my
memory
a
remarkable
letter
addressed
to
me
many
years
ago
which
will
be
found
in
my
introductory
narrative
the
writer
an
irish
gentleman
named
dunboyne
confided
to
me
that
his
marriage
had
associated
him
with
the
murderess
who
had
then
been
recently
executed
as
to
that
infamous
woman
this
circumstance
he
had
naturally
kept
a
secret
from
every
one
including
his
son
then
a
boy
i
alone
was
made
an
exception
to
the
general
rule
because
i
alone
could
tell
him
what
had
become
of
the
poor
little
girl
who
in
spite
of
the
disgraceful
end
of
her
mother
was
still
his
niece
if
the
child
had
not
been
provided
for
he
felt
it
his
duty
to
take
charge
of
her
education
and
to
watch
over
her
prospects
in
the
future
such
had
been
his
object
in
writing
to
me
and
such
was
the
substance
of
his
letter
i
had
merely
informed
him
in
reply
that
his
kind
intentions
had
been
anticipated
and
that
the
child
s
prosperous
future
was
assured
miss
jillgall
s
keen
observation
noticed
the
impression
that
had
been
produced
upon
me
mr
dunboyne
s
name
seems
to
surprise
she
said
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
heard
you
mention
it
i
answered
she
looked
as
if
she
could
hardly
believe
me
surely
you
must
have
heard
the
name
she
said
when
i
told
you
about
poor
euneece
well
then
gracedieu
must
have
mentioned
it
this
second
reply
in
the
negative
irritated
her
at
any
rate
she
said
sharply
you
appeared
to
know
dunboyne
s
name
just
certainly
and
yet
she
persisted
the
name
seemed
to
come
upon
you
as
a
surprise
i
don
t
understand
it
if
i
have
mentioned
philip
s
name
once
i
have
mentioned
it
a
dozen
we
were
completely
at
she
had
taken
something
for
granted
which
was
an
unfathomable
mystery
to
me
well
i
objected
if
you
did
mention
his
name
a
dozen
times
excuse
me
for
asking
the
question
then
good
heavens
cried
miss
jillgall
do
you
mean
to
say
you
never
guessed
that
philip
was
dunboyne
s
son
i
was
petrified
his
son
dunboyne
s
son
how
could
i
have
guessed
it
at
a
later
time
only
the
good
little
creature
who
had
so
innocently
deceived
me
remembered
that
the
mischief
might
have
been
wrought
by
the
force
of
habit
while
he
had
still
a
claim
on
their
regard
the
family
had
always
spoken
of
eunice
s
unworthy
lover
by
his
christian
name
and
what
had
been
familiar
in
their
mouths
felt
the
influence
of
custom
before
time
enough
had
elapsed
to
make
them
think
as
readily
of
the
enemy
as
they
had
hitherto
thought
of
the
friend
but
i
was
ignorant
of
this
and
the
disclosure
by
which
i
found
myself
suddenly
confronted
was
more
than
i
could
support
for
the
moment
speech
was
beyond
me
his
son
dunboyne
s
son
what
a
position
that
young
man
had
occupied
unsuspected
by
his
father
unknown
to
himself
kept
in
ignorance
of
the
family
disgrace
he
had
been
a
guest
in
the
house
of
the
man
who
had
consoled
his
infamous
aunt
on
the
eve
of
her
execution
who
had
saved
his
unhappy
cousin
from
poverty
from
sorrow
from
shame
and
but
one
human
being
knew
this
and
that
human
being
was
myself
observing
my
agitation
miss
jillgall
placed
her
own
construction
on
it
do
you
know
anything
bad
of
philip
she
asked
eagerly
if
it
s
something
that
will
prevent
helena
from
marrying
him
tell
me
what
it
is
i
beg
and
i
knew
no
more
of
philip
whom
she
still
called
by
his
christian
name
than
she
had
told
me
herself
there
was
no
help
for
it
but
to
disappoint
her
at
the
same
time
i
was
unable
to
conceal
that
i
was
ill
at
ease
and
that
it
might
be
well
to
leave
me
by
myself
after
a
look
round
the
bedchamber
to
see
that
nothing
was
wanting
to
my
comfort
she
made
her
quaint
curtsey
and
left
me
with
her
own
inimitable
form
of
farewell
oh
indeed
i
have
been
here
too
long
and
i
m
afraid
i
have
been
guilty
once
or
twice
of
vulgar
familiarity
you
will
excuse
me
i
hope
this
has
been
an
exciting
interview
i
think
i
am
going
to
she
ran
out
of
the
room
and
carried
away
with
her
some
of
my
kindliest
feelings
short
as
the
time
of
our
acquaintance
had
been
what
a
wife
and
what
a
mother
was
lost
there
and
all
for
want
of
a
pretty
face
left
alone
my
thoughts
inevitably
reverted
to
dunboyne
the
elder
and
to
all
that
had
happened
in
gracedieu
s
family
since
the
irish
gentleman
had
written
to
me
in
bygone
years
the
terrible
choice
of
responsibilities
which
had
preyed
on
the
minister
s
mind
had
been
foreseen
by
dunboyne
when
he
first
thought
of
adopting
his
infant
niece
and
had
warned
him
to
dread
what
might
happen
in
the
future
if
he
brought
her
up
as
a
member
of
the
family
with
his
own
boy
and
if
the
two
young
people
became
at
a
later
period
attached
to
each
other
how
had
the
wise
foresight
which
offered
such
a
contrast
to
the
poor
minister
s
impulsive
act
of
mercy
met
with
its
reward
fate
or
providence
call
it
which
we
may
had
brought
dunboyne
s
son
and
the
daughter
of
the
murderess
together
had
inspired
those
two
strangers
with
love
and
had
emboldened
them
to
plight
their
troth
by
a
marriage
engagement
was
the
man
s
betrayal
of
the
trust
placed
in
him
by
the
faithful
girl
to
be
esteemed
a
fortunate
circumstance
by
the
two
persons
who
knew
the
true
story
of
her
parentage
the
minister
and
myself
could
we
rejoice
in
an
act
of
infidelity
which
had
embittered
and
darkened
the
gentle
harmless
life
of
the
victim
or
could
we
on
the
other
hand
encourage
the
ruthless
deceit
the
hateful
treachery
which
had
put
the
wicked
helena
with
no
exposure
to
dread
if
married
into
her
wronged
sister
s
place
impossible
in
the
one
case
as
in
the
other
impossible
equally
hopeless
did
the
prospect
appear
when
i
tried
to
determine
what
my
own
individual
course
of
action
ought
to
be
in
my
calmer
moments
the
idea
had
occurred
to
my
mind
of
going
to
dunboyne
the
younger
and
if
he
had
any
sense
of
shame
left
exerting
my
influence
to
lead
him
back
to
his
betrothed
wife
how
could
i
now
do
this
consistently
with
my
duty
to
the
young
man
s
father
knowing
what
i
knew
and
not
forgetting
that
i
had
myself
advised
gracedieu
to
keep
the
truth
concealed
when
i
was
equally
ignorant
of
philip
dunboyne
s
parentage
and
of
helena
gracedieu
s
treachery
even
if
events
so
ordered
it
that
the
marriage
of
eunice
might
yet
take
place
without
any
interference
exerted
to
produce
that
result
one
way
or
the
other
on
my
part
it
would
be
just
as
impossible
for
me
to
speak
out
now
as
it
had
been
in
the
years
when
i
had
so
cautiously
answered
dunboyne
s
letter
but
what
would
he
think
of
me
if
accident
led
sooner
or
later
to
the
disclosure
which
i
had
felt
bound
to
conceal
the
more
i
tried
to
forecast
the
chances
of
the
future
the
darker
and
the
darker
was
the
view
that
faced
me
to
my
sinking
heart
and
wearied
mind
good
dame
nature
presented
a
more
acceptable
prospect
when
i
happened
to
look
out
of
the
window
of
my
room
there
i
saw
the
trees
and
flowerbeds
of
a
garden
tempting
me
irresistibly
under
the
cloudless
sunshine
of
a
fine
day
i
was
on
my
way
out
to
recover
heart
and
hope
when
a
knock
at
the
door
stopped
me
had
miss
jillgall
returned
when
i
said
come
in
gracedieu
opened
the
door
and
entered
the
room
he
was
so
weak
that
he
staggered
as
he
approached
me
leading
him
to
a
chair
i
noticed
a
wild
look
in
his
eyes
and
a
flush
on
his
haggard
cheeks
something
had
happened
when
you
were
with
me
in
my
room
he
began
did
i
not
tell
you
that
i
had
forgotten
something
certainly
you
well
i
have
found
the
lost
remembrance
my
misfortune
i
ought
to
call
it
the
punishment
for
my
sins
is
recalled
to
me
now
the
worst
curse
that
can
fall
on
a
father
is
the
curse
that
has
come
to
me
i
have
a
wicked
daughter
my
own
child
sir
my
own
child
had
he
been
awake
while
miss
jillgall
and
i
had
been
talking
outside
his
door
had
he
heard
her
ask
me
if
gracedieu
had
said
nothing
of
helena
s
infamous
conduct
to
her
sister
while
he
was
speaking
of
eunice
the
way
to
the
lost
remembrance
had
perhaps
been
found
there
in
any
case
after
that
bitter
allusion
to
his
wicked
daughter
some
result
must
follow
helena
gracedieu
and
a
day
of
reckoning
might
be
nearer
to
each
other
already
than
i
had
ventured
to
hope
i
waited
anxiously
for
what
he
might
say
to
me
next
chapter
xxxvi
the
wandering
mind
for
the
moment
the
minister
disappointed
me
without
speaking
without
even
looking
up
he
took
out
his
pocketbook
and
began
to
write
in
it
constantly
interrupted
either
by
a
trembling
in
the
hand
that
held
the
pencil
or
by
a
difficulty
as
i
imagined
in
expressing
thoughts
imperfectly
realized
his
patience
gave
way
he
dashed
the
book
on
the
floor
my
mind
is
gone
he
burst
out
oh
father
in
heaven
let
death
deliver
me
from
a
body
without
a
mind
who
could
hear
him
and
be
guilty
of
the
cruelty
of
preaching
i
picked
up
the
pocketbook
and
offered
to
help
him
do
you
think
you
can
he
asked
i
can
at
least
good
fellow
what
should
i
do
without
you
see
now
here
is
my
difficulty
i
have
got
so
many
things
to
say
i
want
to
separate
them
or
else
they
will
all
run
into
each
other
look
at
the
book
my
poor
friend
said
mournfully
they
have
run
into
each
other
in
spite
of
the
entries
proved
to
be
nearly
incomprehensible
here
and
there
i
discovered
some
scattered
words
which
showed
themselves
more
or
less
distinctly
in
the
midst
of
the
surrounding
confusion
the
first
word
that
i
could
make
out
was
helped
by
that
hint
i
trusted
to
to
guide
me
in
speaking
to
him
it
was
necessary
to
be
positive
or
he
would
have
lost
all
faith
in
me
well
he
said
impatiently
well
i
answered
you
have
something
to
say
to
me
about
the
education
which
you
have
given
to
your
don
t
put
them
together
he
cried
dear
patient
sweet
eunice
must
not
be
confounded
with
that
hush
hush
gracedieu
badly
as
miss
helena
has
behaved
she
is
your
own
i
repudiate
her
sir
think
for
a
moment
of
what
she
has
done
and
then
think
of
the
religious
education
that
i
have
given
her
heartless
deceitful
the
most
ignorant
creature
in
the
lowest
dens
of
this
town
could
have
done
nothing
more
basely
cruel
and
this
after
years
on
years
of
patient
christian
instruction
on
my
part
what
is
religion
what
is
education
i
read
a
horrible
book
once
i
forget
who
was
the
author
it
called
religion
superstition
and
education
empty
form
i
don
t
know
upon
my
word
i
don
t
know
that
the
book
may
not
oh
my
tongue
why
don
t
i
keep
a
guard
over
my
tongue
are
you
a
father
too
don
t
interrupt
me
put
yourself
in
my
place
and
think
of
it
heartless
deceitful
and
daughter
give
me
the
pocketbook
i
want
to
see
which
memorandum
comes
he
had
now
wrought
himself
into
a
state
of
excitement
which
relieved
his
spirits
of
the
depression
that
had
weighed
on
them
up
to
this
time
his
harmless
vanity
always
as
i
suspect
a
latent
quality
in
his
kindly
nature
had
already
restored
his
confidence
with
a
smile
he
consulted
his
own
unintelligible
entries
and
made
his
own
wild
discoveries
ah
yes
m
stands
for
minister
i
come
first
am
i
to
blame
am
i
god
forgive
me
my
many
sins
am
i
heartless
am
i
deceitful
my
good
friend
not
even
your
enemies
could
say
that
thank
you
who
comes
next
he
consulted
the
book
again
her
mother
her
sainted
mother
comes
next
people
say
she
is
like
her
mother
was
my
wife
heartless
was
the
angel
of
my
life
deceitful
that
i
thought
to
myself
is
exactly
what
your
wife
was
and
exactly
what
reappears
in
your
wife
s
where
does
her
wickedness
come
from
he
went
on
not
from
her
mother
not
from
me
not
from
a
neglected
he
suddenly
stepped
up
to
me
and
laid
his
hands
on
my
shoulders
his
voice
dropped
to
hoarse
moaning
awestruck
tones
shall
i
tell
you
what
it
is
a
possession
of
the
it
was
so
evidently
desirable
to
prevent
any
continuation
of
such
a
train
of
thought
as
this
that
i
could
feel
no
hesitation
in
interrupting
him
will
you
hear
what
i
have
to
say
i
asked
bluntly
his
humor
changed
again
he
made
me
a
low
bow
and
went
back
to
his
chair
i
will
hear
you
with
pleasure
he
answered
politely
you
are
the
most
eloquent
man
i
know
with
one
exception
myself
of
course
it
is
mere
waste
of
time
i
continued
to
regret
the
excellent
education
which
your
daughter
has
making
that
reply
i
was
tempted
to
add
another
word
of
truth
all
education
is
at
the
mercy
of
two
powerful
the
influence
of
temperament
and
the
influence
of
circumstances
but
this
was
philosophy
how
could
i
expect
him
to
submit
to
philosophy
what
we
know
of
miss
helena
i
went
on
must
be
enough
for
us
she
has
plotted
and
she
means
to
succeed
stop
just
my
idea
he
declared
firmly
i
refuse
my
consent
to
that
abominable
in
the
popular
phrase
i
struck
while
the
iron
was
hot
you
must
do
more
than
that
sir
i
told
him
his
vanity
suddenly
took
the
alarm
i
was
leading
him
rather
too
undisguisedly
he
handed
his
book
back
to
me
you
will
find
he
said
loftily
that
i
have
put
it
all
down
i
pretended
to
find
it
and
read
an
imaginary
entry
to
this
effect
after
what
she
has
already
done
helena
is
capable
of
marrying
in
defiance
of
my
wishes
and
commands
this
must
be
considered
and
provided
so
far
i
had
succeeded
in
flattering
him
but
when
thinking
of
his
paternal
authority
i
alluded
next
to
his
daughter
s
age
his
eyes
rested
on
me
with
a
look
of
downright
terror
no
more
of
that
he
said
i
won
t
talk
of
the
girls
ages
even
with
what
did
he
mean
it
was
useless
to
ask
i
went
on
with
the
matter
in
hand
still
deliberately
speaking
to
him
as
i
might
have
spoken
to
a
man
with
an
intellect
as
clear
as
my
own
in
my
experience
this
practice
generally
stimulates
a
weak
intelligence
to
do
its
best
we
all
know
how
children
receive
talk
that
is
lowered
or
books
that
are
lowered
to
their
presumed
level
i
shall
take
it
for
granted
i
continued
that
miss
helena
is
still
under
your
lawful
authority
she
can
only
arrive
at
her
ends
by
means
of
a
runaway
marriage
in
that
case
much
depends
on
the
man
you
told
me
you
couldn
t
help
liking
him
this
was
of
course
before
you
knew
of
the
infamous
manner
in
which
he
has
behaved
you
must
have
changed
your
opinion
he
seemed
to
be
at
a
loss
how
to
reply
i
am
afraid
he
said
the
young
man
was
drawn
into
it
by
here
was
miss
jillgall
s
apology
for
philip
dunboyne
repeated
in
other
words
despising
and
detesting
the
fellow
as
i
did
i
was
forced
to
admit
to
myself
that
he
must
be
recommended
by
personal
attractions
which
it
would
be
necessary
to
reckon
with
i
tried
to
get
some
more
information
from
gracedieu
the
excuse
you
have
just
made
for
him
i
resumed
implies
that
he
is
a
weak
man
easily
persuaded
easily
the
minister
answered
by
nodding
his
head
such
weakness
as
that
i
persisted
is
a
vice
in
itself
it
has
led
already
sir
to
the
saddest
he
admitted
this
by
another
nod
i
don
t
wish
to
shock
you
gracedieu
but
i
must
recommend
employing
the
means
that
present
themselves
you
must
practice
on
this
man
s
weakness
for
the
sake
of
the
good
that
may
come
of
it
i
hear
he
is
in
london
with
his
father
try
the
strong
influence
and
write
to
his
father
there
is
another
reason
besides
for
doing
this
it
is
quite
possible
that
the
truth
has
been
concealed
from
dunboyne
the
elder
take
care
that
he
is
informed
of
what
has
really
happened
are
you
looking
for
pen
ink
and
paper
let
me
offer
you
the
writing
materials
which
i
use
in
i
placed
them
before
him
he
took
up
the
pen
he
arranged
the
paper
he
was
eager
to
begin
after
writing
a
few
words
he
stopped
reflected
tried
again
stopped
again
tore
up
the
little
that
he
had
done
and
began
a
new
letter
ending
in
the
same
miserable
result
it
was
impossible
to
witness
his
helplessness
to
see
how
pitiably
patient
he
was
over
his
own
incapacity
and
to
let
the
melancholy
spectacle
go
on
i
proposed
to
write
the
letter
authenticating
it
of
course
by
his
signature
when
he
allowed
me
to
take
the
pen
he
turned
away
his
face
ashamed
to
let
me
see
what
he
suffered
was
this
the
same
man
whose
great
nature
had
so
nobly
asserted
itself
in
the
condemned
cell
poor
mortality
the
letter
was
easily
written
i
had
only
to
inform
dunboyne
of
his
son
s
conduct
repeating
in
the
plainest
language
that
i
could
use
what
miss
jillgall
had
related
to
me
arrived
at
the
conclusion
i
contrived
to
make
gracedieu
express
himself
in
these
strong
terms
i
protest
against
the
marriage
in
justice
to
you
sir
as
well
as
to
myself
we
can
neither
of
us
content
to
be
accomplices
in
an
act
of
domestic
treason
of
the
basest
in
silence
the
minister
read
the
letter
and
attached
his
signature
to
it
in
silence
he
rose
and
took
my
arm
i
asked
if
he
wished
to
go
to
his
room
he
only
replied
by
a
sign
i
offered
to
sit
with
him
and
try
to
cheer
him
gratefully
he
pressed
my
hand
gently
he
put
me
back
from
the
door
crushed
by
the
miserable
discovery
of
the
decay
of
his
own
faculties
what
could
i
do
what
could
i
say
nothing
miss
jillgall
was
in
the
with
the
necessary
explanations
i
showed
her
the
letter
she
read
it
with
breathless
interest
it
terrifies
one
to
think
how
much
depends
on
old
dunboyne
she
said
you
know
him
what
sort
of
man
is
he
i
could
only
assure
her
after
what
i
remembered
of
his
letter
to
me
that
he
was
a
man
whom
we
could
depend
upon
miss
jillgall
possessed
treasures
of
information
to
which
i
could
lay
no
claim
dunboyne
she
told
me
was
a
scholar
and
a
writer
and
a
rich
man
his
views
on
marriage
were
liberal
in
the
extreme
let
his
son
find
good
principles
good
temper
and
good
looks
in
a
wife
and
he
would
promise
to
find
the
money
i
get
these
particulars
said
miss
jillgall
from
dear
euneece
they
are
surely
encouraging
that
helena
may
carry
out
dunboyne
s
views
in
her
personal
appearance
is
i
regret
to
say
what
i
can
t
deny
but
as
to
the
other
qualifications
how
hopeful
is
the
prospect
good
principles
and
good
temper
ha
ha
helena
has
the
principles
of
jezebel
and
the
temper
of
lady
after
dashing
off
this
striking
sketch
of
character
the
fair
artist
asked
to
look
at
my
letter
again
and
observed
that
the
address
was
wanting
i
can
set
this
right
for
you
she
resumed
thanks
as
before
to
my
sweet
euneece
and
don
t
be
in
a
hurry
i
can
make
myself
useful
in
another
way
oh
how
i
do
enjoy
making
myself
useful
if
you
trust
your
letter
to
the
basket
in
the
hall
helena
s
lovely
eyes
capable
of
the
meanest
conceivable
actions
are
sure
to
take
a
peep
at
the
address
in
that
case
do
you
think
your
letter
would
get
to
london
i
am
afraid
you
detect
a
faint
infusion
of
spitefulness
in
that
question
oh
for
shame
i
ll
post
the
letter
chapter
xxxvii
the
shameless
sister
for
some
reason
which
my
unassisted
penetration
was
unable
to
discover
miss
helena
gracedieu
kept
out
of
my
way
at
dinner
on
the
day
of
my
arrival
and
at
breakfast
on
the
next
morning
she
was
present
of
course
ready
to
make
herself
agreeable
in
a
modest
way
and
provided
with
the
necessary
supply
of
cheerful
but
the
meal
having
come
to
an
end
she
had
her
domestic
excuse
ready
and
unostentatiously
disappeared
like
a
young
lady
i
never
met
her
on
the
stairs
never
found
myself
intruding
on
her
in
the
never
caught
her
getting
out
of
my
way
in
the
garden
as
much
at
a
loss
for
an
explanation
of
these
mysteries
as
i
was
miss
jillgall
s
interest
in
my
welfare
led
her
to
caution
me
in
a
vague
and
general
way
take
my
word
for
it
dear
mr
governor
she
has
some
design
on
you
will
you
allow
an
insignificant
old
maid
to
offer
a
suggestion
oh
thank
you
i
will
venture
to
advise
please
look
back
at
your
experience
of
the
very
worst
female
prisoner
you
ever
had
to
deal
with
and
be
guided
accordingly
if
helena
catches
you
at
a
private
in
less
than
half
an
hour
afterward
helena
caught
me
i
was
writing
in
my
room
when
the
maidservant
came
in
with
a
message
miss
helena
s
compliments
sir
and
would
you
please
spare
her
half
an
hour
downstairs
my
first
excuse
was
of
course
that
i
was
engaged
this
was
disposed
of
by
a
second
message
provided
beforehand
no
doubt
for
an
anticipated
refusal
miss
helena
wished
me
to
say
sir
that
her
time
is
your
i
was
still
obstinate
i
pleaded
next
that
my
day
was
filled
up
a
third
message
had
evidently
been
prepared
even
for
this
emergency
miss
helena
will
regret
sir
having
the
pleasure
deferred
but
she
will
leave
you
to
make
your
own
appointment
for
persistency
so
inveterate
as
this
led
to
a
result
which
gracedieu
s
cautious
daughter
had
not
perhaps
contemplated
it
put
me
on
my
guard
there
seemed
to
be
a
chance
to
say
the
least
of
it
that
i
might
serve
eunice
s
interests
if
i
discovered
what
the
enemy
had
to
say
i
locked
up
my
writing
declared
myself
incapable
of
putting
miss
helena
to
needless
inconvenience
and
followed
the
maid
to
the
lower
floor
of
the
house
the
room
to
which
i
was
conducted
proved
to
be
empty
i
looked
round
me
if
i
had
been
told
that
a
man
lived
there
who
was
absolutely
indifferent
to
appearances
i
should
have
concluded
that
his
views
were
faithfully
represented
by
his
place
of
abode
the
chairs
and
tables
reminded
me
of
a
railway
the
shabby
little
bookcase
was
the
mute
record
of
a
life
indifferent
to
literature
the
carpet
was
of
that
dreadful
drab
color
still
the
cherished
favorite
of
the
average
english
mind
in
spite
of
every
protest
that
can
be
entered
against
it
on
behalf
of
art
the
ceiling
recently
whitewashed
made
my
eyes
ache
when
they
looked
at
it
on
either
side
of
the
window
flaccid
green
curtains
hung
helplessly
with
nothing
to
loop
them
up
the
and
the
viewed
as
specimens
of
woodwork
recalled
the
bedrooms
on
show
in
cheap
shops
the
books
mostly
in
bindings
were
devoted
to
the
literature
which
is
called
religious
i
only
discovered
three
worldly
publications
among
them
domestic
cookery
etiquette
for
ladies
and
hints
on
the
breeding
of
poultry
an
ugly
little
clock
ticking
noisily
in
a
black
case
and
two
candlesticks
of
base
metal
placed
on
either
side
of
it
completed
the
ornaments
on
the
neither
pictures
nor
prints
hid
the
barrenness
of
the
walls
i
saw
no
needlework
and
no
flowers
the
one
object
in
the
place
which
showed
any
pretensions
to
beauty
was
a
in
an
elegant
gilt
frame
sacred
to
vanity
and
worthy
of
the
office
that
it
filled
such
was
helena
gracedieu
s
i
really
could
not
help
thinking
how
like
her
she
came
in
with
a
face
perfectly
adapted
to
the
circumstances
pleased
and
smiling
amiably
deferential
in
consideration
of
the
claims
of
her
father
s
guest
and
to
my
surprise
in
some
degree
suggestive
of
one
of
those
incorrigible
female
prisoners
to
whom
miss
jillgall
had
referred
me
when
she
offered
a
word
of
advice
how
kind
of
you
to
come
so
soon
excuse
my
receiving
you
in
my
we
shall
not
be
interrupted
here
very
plainly
furnished
is
it
not
i
dislike
ostentation
and
display
ornaments
are
out
of
place
in
a
room
devoted
to
domestic
necessities
i
hate
domestic
necessities
you
notice
the
it
s
a
present
i
should
never
have
put
such
a
thing
up
perhaps
my
vanity
excuses
she
pointed
the
last
remark
by
a
look
at
herself
in
the
glass
using
it
while
she
despised
it
yes
there
was
a
handsome
face
paying
her
its
reflected
compliment
but
not
so
well
matched
as
it
might
have
been
by
a
handsome
figure
her
feet
were
too
large
her
shoulders
were
too
high
the
graceful
undulations
of
a
girl
were
absent
when
she
walked
and
her
bosom
was
to
my
mind
unduly
developed
for
her
time
of
life
she
sat
down
by
me
with
her
back
to
the
light
happening
to
be
opposite
to
the
window
i
offered
her
the
advantage
of
a
clear
view
of
my
face
she
waited
for
me
and
i
waited
for
her
and
there
was
an
awkward
pause
before
we
spoke
she
set
the
example
isn
t
it
curious
she
remarked
when
two
people
have
something
particular
to
say
to
each
other
and
nothing
to
hinder
them
they
never
seem
to
know
how
to
say
it
you
are
the
oldest
sir
why
don
t
you
begin
because
i
have
nothing
particular
to
in
plain
words
you
mean
that
i
must
begin
if
you
very
well
i
want
to
know
whether
i
have
given
you
and
miss
jillgall
of
course
as
much
time
as
you
want
and
as
many
opportunities
as
you
could
desire
pray
go
on
miss
have
i
not
said
enough
already
not
enough
i
regret
to
say
to
convey
your
meaning
to
she
drew
her
chair
a
little
further
away
from
me
i
am
sadly
disappointed
she
said
i
had
such
a
high
opinion
of
your
perfect
candor
i
thought
to
myself
there
is
such
a
striking
expression
of
frankness
in
his
face
another
illusion
gone
i
hope
you
won
t
think
i
am
offended
if
i
say
a
bold
word
i
am
only
a
young
girl
to
be
sure
but
i
am
not
quite
such
a
fool
as
you
take
me
for
do
you
really
think
i
don
t
know
that
miss
jillgall
has
been
telling
you
everything
that
is
bad
about
me
putting
every
mistake
that
i
have
made
every
fault
that
i
have
committed
in
the
worst
possible
point
of
view
and
you
have
listened
to
her
quite
naturally
and
you
are
prejudiced
strongly
prejudiced
against
me
what
else
could
you
be
under
the
circumstances
i
don
t
complain
i
have
purposely
kept
out
of
your
way
and
out
of
miss
jillgall
s
way
in
short
i
have
afforded
you
every
facility
as
the
prospectuses
say
i
only
want
to
know
if
my
turn
has
come
at
last
once
more
have
i
given
you
time
enough
and
opportunities
enough
a
great
deal
more
than
do
you
mean
that
you
have
made
up
your
mind
about
me
without
stopping
to
think
that
is
exactly
what
i
mean
an
act
of
treachery
miss
helena
an
act
of
treachery
no
honest
person
need
hesitate
to
condemn
it
i
am
sorry
you
sent
for
i
got
up
to
go
with
an
ironical
gesture
of
remonstrance
she
signed
to
me
to
sit
down
again
must
i
remind
you
dear
sir
of
our
famous
native
virtue
fair
play
is
surely
due
to
a
young
person
who
has
nobody
to
take
her
part
you
talked
of
treachery
just
how
i
deny
the
treachery
please
give
me
a
i
returned
to
my
chair
or
would
you
prefer
waiting
she
went
out
till
my
sister
comes
here
later
in
the
day
and
continues
what
miss
jillgall
has
begun
with
the
great
advantage
of
being
young
and
when
the
female
mind
gets
into
this
state
no
wise
man
answers
the
female
questions
am
i
to
take
silence
as
meaning
go
on
miss
helena
inquired
i
begged
her
to
interpret
my
silence
in
the
sense
most
agreeable
to
herself
this
naturally
encouraged
her
she
made
a
proposal
do
you
mind
changing
places
sir
just
as
you
like
miss
we
changed
chairs
the
light
now
fell
full
on
her
face
had
she
deliberately
challenged
me
to
look
into
her
secret
mind
if
i
could
anything
like
the
stark
insensibility
of
that
young
girl
to
every
refinement
of
feeling
to
every
becoming
doubt
of
herself
to
every
customary
timidity
of
her
age
and
sex
in
the
presence
of
a
man
who
had
not
disguised
his
unfavorable
opinion
of
her
i
never
met
with
in
all
my
experience
of
the
world
and
of
women
i
wish
to
be
quite
mistress
of
myself
she
explained
your
face
for
some
reason
which
i
really
don
t
know
irritates
me
the
fact
is
i
have
great
pride
in
keeping
my
temper
please
make
allowances
now
about
miss
jillgall
i
suppose
she
told
you
how
my
sister
first
met
with
philip
dunboyne
she
also
mentioned
perhaps
that
he
was
a
man
she
now
we
shall
get
on
when
philip
came
to
our
town
here
and
saw
me
for
the
first
time
do
you
object
to
my
speaking
familiarly
of
him
by
his
christian
name
in
the
case
of
any
one
else
in
your
position
miss
helena
i
should
venture
to
call
it
bad
i
was
provoked
into
saying
that
it
failed
entirely
as
a
effort
in
the
way
of
implied
reproof
miss
helena
smiled
you
grant
me
a
liberty
which
you
would
not
concede
to
another
that
was
how
she
viewed
it
we
are
getting
on
better
already
to
return
to
what
i
was
saying
when
philip
first
saw
me
i
have
it
from
himself
mind
he
felt
that
i
should
have
been
his
choice
if
he
had
met
with
me
before
he
met
with
my
sister
do
you
blame
him
if
you
will
take
my
advice
i
said
you
will
not
inquire
too
closely
into
my
opinion
of
philip
perhaps
you
don
t
wish
me
to
say
anymore
she
suggested
on
the
contrary
pray
go
on
if
you
after
that
concession
she
was
amiability
itself
oh
yes
she
assured
me
that
s
easily
and
she
went
on
accordingly
philip
having
informed
me
of
the
state
of
his
affections
i
naturally
followed
his
example
in
fact
we
exchanged
confessions
our
marriage
engagement
followed
as
a
matter
of
course
do
you
blame
me
i
will
wait
till
you
have
i
have
no
more
to
she
made
that
amazing
reply
with
such
perfect
composure
that
i
began
to
fear
there
must
have
been
some
misunderstanding
between
us
is
that
really
all
you
have
to
say
for
yourself
i
persisted
her
patience
with
me
was
most
exemplary
she
lowered
herself
to
my
level
not
trusting
to
words
only
on
this
occasion
she
so
to
say
beat
her
meaning
into
my
head
by
gesticulating
on
her
fingers
as
if
she
was
educating
a
child
philip
and
i
she
began
are
the
victims
of
an
accident
which
kept
us
apart
when
we
ought
to
have
met
together
we
are
not
responsible
for
an
she
impressed
this
on
me
by
touching
her
forefinger
philip
and
i
fell
in
love
with
each
other
at
first
sight
we
are
not
responsible
for
the
feelings
implanted
in
our
natures
by
an
she
assisted
me
in
understanding
this
by
touching
her
middle
finger
philip
and
i
owe
a
duty
to
each
other
and
accept
a
responsibility
under
those
circumstances
the
responsibility
of
getting
a
touch
on
her
third
finger
and
an
indulgent
bow
announced
that
the
lesson
was
ended
i
am
not
a
clever
man
like
you
she
modestly
acknowledged
but
i
ask
you
to
help
us
when
you
next
see
my
father
with
some
confidence
you
know
exactly
what
to
say
to
him
by
this
time
nothing
has
been
pardon
me
i
said
a
person
has
been
indeed
what
person
your
a
little
perplexed
at
first
miss
helena
reflected
and
recovered
herself
ah
yes
she
said
i
was
afraid
i
might
be
obliged
to
trouble
you
for
an
explanation
i
see
it
now
you
are
shocked
very
properly
when
feelings
of
enmity
exist
between
near
relations
and
you
wish
to
be
assured
that
i
bear
no
malice
toward
eunice
she
is
violent
she
is
sulky
she
is
stupid
she
is
selfish
and
she
cruelly
refuses
to
live
in
the
same
house
with
me
make
your
mind
easy
sir
i
forgive
my
let
me
not
attempt
to
disguise
it
miss
helena
gracedieu
confounded
me
ordinary
audacity
is
one
of
those
forms
of
insolence
which
mature
experience
dismisses
with
contempt
this
girl
s
audacity
struck
down
all
resistance
for
one
shocking
reason
it
was
unquestionably
sincere
strong
conviction
of
her
own
virtue
stared
at
me
in
her
proud
and
daring
eyes
at
that
time
i
was
not
aware
of
what
i
have
learned
since
the
horrid
hardening
of
her
moral
sense
had
been
accomplished
by
herself
in
her
diary
there
has
been
found
the
confession
of
a
secret
course
of
reading
with
supplementary
reflections
flowing
from
it
which
need
only
to
be
described
as
worthy
of
their
source
a
person
capable
of
repentance
and
reform
would
in
her
place
have
seen
that
she
had
disgusted
me
not
a
suspicion
of
this
occurred
to
miss
helena
i
see
you
are
embarrassed
she
remarked
and
i
am
at
no
loss
to
account
for
it
you
are
too
polite
to
acknowledge
that
i
have
not
made
a
friend
of
you
yet
oh
i
mean
to
do
it
no
i
said
i
think
we
shall
see
she
replied
sooner
or
later
you
will
find
yourself
saying
a
kind
word
to
my
father
for
philip
and
she
rose
and
took
a
turn
in
the
room
and
stopped
eying
me
attentively
are
you
thinking
of
eunice
she
asked
she
has
your
sympathy
i
suppose
my
i
needn
t
ask
how
i
stand
in
your
estimation
after
that
pray
express
yourself
freely
your
looks
confess
it
you
view
me
with
a
feeling
of
i
view
you
with
a
feeling
of
the
exasperating
influences
of
her
language
her
looks
and
her
tones
would
as
i
venture
to
think
have
got
to
the
end
of
another
man
s
before
this
anyway
she
had
at
last
irritated
me
into
speaking
as
strongly
as
i
felt
what
i
said
had
been
so
plainly
perhaps
so
rudely
expressed
that
misinterpretation
of
it
seemed
to
be
impossible
she
mistook
me
nevertheless
the
most
merciless
disclosure
of
the
dreary
side
of
human
destiny
is
surely
to
be
found
in
the
failure
of
words
spoken
or
written
so
to
answer
their
purpose
that
we
can
trust
them
in
our
attempts
to
communicate
with
each
other
even
when
he
seems
to
be
connected
by
the
nearest
and
dearest
relations
with
his
what
a
solitary
creature
tried
by
the
test
of
sympathy
the
human
being
really
is
in
the
teeming
world
that
he
inhabits
affording
one
more
example
of
the
impotence
of
human
language
to
speak
for
itself
my
misinterpreted
words
had
found
their
way
to
the
one
sensitive
place
in
helena
gracedieu
s
impenetrable
nature
she
betrayed
it
in
the
quivering
and
flushing
of
her
hard
face
and
in
the
appeal
to
the
which
escaped
her
eyes
the
next
moment
my
hasty
reply
had
roused
the
idea
of
a
covert
insult
addressed
to
her
handsome
face
in
other
words
i
had
wounded
her
vanity
driven
by
resentment
out
came
the
secret
distrust
of
me
which
had
been
lurking
in
that
cold
heart
from
the
moment
when
we
first
met
i
inspire
you
with
horror
and
eunice
inspires
you
with
compassion
she
said
that
mr
governor
is
not
may
i
ask
why
you
know
you
will
have
it
i
want
an
explanation
miss
helena
if
that
is
what
you
take
your
explanation
then
you
are
not
the
stranger
you
are
said
to
be
to
my
sister
and
to
me
your
interest
in
eunice
is
a
personal
interest
of
some
kind
i
don
t
pretend
to
guess
what
it
is
as
for
myself
it
is
plain
that
somebody
else
has
been
setting
you
against
me
before
miss
jillgall
got
possession
of
your
private
in
alluding
to
eunice
she
had
blundered
strangely
enough
on
something
like
the
truth
but
when
she
spoke
of
herself
the
headlong
malignity
of
her
suspicions
making
every
allowance
for
the
anger
that
had
hurried
her
into
them
seemed
to
call
for
some
little
protest
against
a
false
assertion
i
told
her
that
she
was
completely
mistaken
i
am
completely
right
she
answered
i
saw
saw
what
saw
you
pretending
to
be
a
stranger
to
when
did
i
do
that
you
did
it
when
we
met
at
the
the
reply
was
too
ridiculous
for
the
preservation
of
any
control
over
my
own
sense
of
humor
it
was
wrong
but
it
was
inevitable
i
laughed
she
looked
at
me
with
a
fury
revealing
a
concentration
of
evil
passion
in
her
which
i
had
not
seen
yet
i
asked
her
pardon
i
begged
her
to
think
a
little
before
she
persisted
in
taking
a
view
of
my
conduct
unworthy
of
her
and
unjust
to
myself
unjust
to
you
she
burst
out
who
are
you
a
man
who
has
driven
your
trade
has
spies
always
at
his
command
yes
and
knows
how
to
use
them
you
were
primed
with
private
information
you
had
for
all
i
know
a
stolen
photograph
of
me
in
your
pocket
before
ever
you
came
to
our
town
do
you
still
deny
it
oh
sir
why
degrade
yourself
by
telling
a
lie
no
such
outrage
as
this
had
ever
been
inflicted
on
me
at
any
time
in
my
life
my
forbearance
must
i
suppose
have
been
more
severely
tried
than
i
was
aware
of
myself
with
or
without
excuse
for
me
i
was
weak
enough
to
let
a
girl
s
spiteful
tongue
sting
me
and
worse
still
to
let
her
see
that
i
felt
it
you
shall
have
no
second
opportunity
miss
gracedieu
of
insulting
with
that
foolish
reply
i
opened
the
door
violently
and
went
out
she
ran
after
me
triumphing
in
having
roused
the
temper
of
a
man
old
enough
to
have
been
her
grandfather
and
caught
me
by
the
arm
your
own
conduct
has
exposed
that
was
literally
how
she
expressed
herself
i
saw
it
in
your
eyes
when
we
met
at
the
station
you
the
stranger
you
who
allowed
poor
ignorant
me
to
introduce
myself
you
knew
me
all
the
time
knew
me
by
sight
i
shook
her
hand
off
with
an
inconsiderable
roughness
humiliating
to
remember
it
s
false
i
cried
i
knew
you
by
your
likeness
to
your
the
moment
the
words
had
passed
my
lips
i
came
to
my
senses
again
i
remembered
what
fatal
words
they
might
prove
to
be
if
they
reached
the
minister
s
ears
heard
only
by
his
daughter
my
reply
seemed
to
cool
the
heat
of
her
anger
in
an
instant
so
you
knew
my
mother
she
said
my
father
never
told
us
that
when
he
spoke
of
your
being
such
a
very
old
friend
of
his
strange
to
say
the
least
of
i
was
wise
enough
now
when
wisdom
had
come
too
late
not
to
attempt
to
explain
myself
and
not
to
give
her
an
opportunity
of
saying
more
we
are
neither
of
us
in
a
state
of
mind
i
answered
to
allow
this
interview
to
continue
i
must
try
to
recover
my
composure
and
i
leave
you
to
do
the
in
the
solitude
of
my
room
i
was
able
to
look
my
position
fairly
in
the
face
gracedieu
s
wife
had
come
to
me
in
the
time
without
her
husband
s
knowledge
tempted
to
a
cruel
resolve
by
the
maternal
triumph
of
having
an
infant
of
her
own
she
had
resolved
to
rid
herself
of
the
poor
little
rival
in
her
husband
s
fatherly
affection
by
consigning
the
adopted
child
to
the
keeping
of
a
charitable
asylum
she
had
dared
to
ask
me
to
help
her
i
had
kept
the
secret
of
her
shameful
visit
i
can
honestly
say
for
the
minister
s
sake
and
now
long
after
time
had
doomed
those
events
to
oblivion
they
were
revived
and
revived
by
me
thanks
to
my
folly
gracedieu
s
daughter
knew
what
i
had
concealed
from
gracedieu
himself
what
course
did
respect
for
my
friend
and
respect
for
myself
counsel
me
to
take
i
could
only
see
before
me
a
choice
of
two
evils
to
wait
for
events
with
the
too
certain
prospect
of
a
vindictive
betrayal
of
my
indiscretion
by
helena
gracedieu
or
to
take
the
initiative
into
my
own
hands
and
risk
consequences
which
i
might
regret
to
the
end
of
my
life
by
making
my
confession
to
the
minister
before
i
had
decided
somebody
knocked
at
the
door
it
was
the
again
was
it
possible
she
had
been
sent
by
helena
another
message
yes
sir
my
master
wishes
to
see
chapter
xxxviii
the
girls
ages
had
the
minister
s
desire
to
see
me
been
inspired
by
his
daughter
s
betrayal
of
what
i
had
unfortunately
said
to
her
although
he
would
certainly
not
consent
to
receive
her
personally
she
would
be
at
liberty
to
adopt
a
written
method
of
communication
with
him
and
the
letter
might
be
addressed
in
such
a
manner
as
to
pique
his
curiosity
if
helena
s
vindictive
purpose
had
been
already
accomplished
and
if
gracedieu
left
me
no
alternative
but
to
present
his
unworthy
wife
in
her
true
character
i
can
honestly
say
that
i
dreaded
the
consequences
not
as
they
might
affect
myself
but
as
they
might
affect
my
unhappy
friend
in
his
enfeebled
state
of
body
and
mind
when
i
entered
his
room
he
was
still
in
bed
the
were
so
drawn
on
the
side
nearest
to
the
window
as
to
keep
the
light
from
falling
too
brightly
on
his
weak
eyes
in
the
shadow
thus
thrown
on
him
it
was
not
possible
to
see
his
face
plainly
enough
from
the
open
side
of
the
bed
to
arrive
at
any
definite
conclusion
as
to
what
might
be
passing
in
his
mind
after
having
been
awake
for
some
hours
during
the
earlier
part
of
the
night
he
had
enjoyed
a
long
and
undisturbed
sleep
i
feel
stronger
this
morning
he
said
and
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
while
my
mind
is
if
the
quiet
tone
of
his
voice
was
not
an
assumed
tone
he
was
surely
ignorant
of
all
that
had
passed
between
his
daughter
and
myself
eunice
will
be
here
soon
he
proceeded
and
i
ought
to
explain
why
i
have
sent
for
her
to
come
and
meet
you
i
have
reasons
serious
reasons
mind
for
wishing
you
to
compare
her
personal
appearance
with
helena
s
personal
appearance
and
then
to
tell
me
which
of
the
two
on
a
fair
comparison
looks
the
eldest
pray
bear
in
mind
that
i
attach
the
greatest
importance
to
the
conclusion
at
which
you
may
he
spoke
more
clearly
and
collectedly
than
i
had
heard
him
speak
yet
here
and
there
i
detected
hesitations
and
repetitions
which
i
have
purposely
passed
over
the
substance
of
what
he
said
to
me
is
all
that
i
shall
present
in
this
place
careful
as
i
have
been
to
keep
my
record
of
events
within
strict
limits
i
have
written
at
a
length
which
i
was
far
indeed
from
contemplating
when
i
accepted
gracedieu
s
invitation
having
promised
to
comply
with
the
strange
request
which
he
had
addressed
to
me
i
ventured
to
remind
him
of
past
occasions
on
which
he
had
pointedly
abstained
when
the
subject
presented
itself
from
speaking
of
the
girls
ages
you
have
left
it
to
my
discretion
i
added
to
decide
a
question
in
which
you
are
seriously
interested
relating
to
your
daughters
have
i
no
excuse
for
regretting
that
i
have
not
been
admitted
to
your
confidence
a
little
more
freely
you
have
every
excuse
he
answered
but
you
trouble
me
all
the
same
there
was
something
else
that
i
had
to
say
to
you
and
your
curiosity
gets
in
the
he
said
this
with
a
sullen
emphasis
in
my
position
the
worst
of
evils
was
suspense
i
told
him
that
my
curiosity
could
wait
and
i
begged
that
he
would
relieve
his
mind
of
what
was
pressing
on
it
at
the
moment
let
me
think
a
little
he
said
i
waited
anxiously
for
the
decision
at
which
he
might
arrive
nothing
came
of
it
to
justify
my
misgivings
leave
what
i
have
in
my
mind
to
ripen
in
my
mind
he
said
the
mystery
about
the
girls
ages
seems
to
irritate
you
if
i
put
my
good
friend
s
temper
to
any
further
trial
he
will
be
of
no
use
to
me
never
mind
if
my
head
swims
i
m
used
to
that
now
listen
strange
as
the
preface
was
the
explanation
that
followed
was
stranger
yet
i
offer
a
shortened
and
simplified
version
giving
accurately
the
substance
of
what
i
heard
the
minister
entered
without
reserve
on
the
mysterious
subject
of
the
ages
eunice
he
informed
me
was
nearly
two
years
older
than
helena
if
she
outwardly
showed
her
superiority
of
age
any
person
acquainted
with
the
circumstances
under
which
the
adopted
infant
had
been
received
into
gracedieu
s
childless
household
need
only
compare
the
sisters
in
and
would
thereupon
identify
the
young
lady
of
the
two
as
the
offspring
of
the
woman
who
had
been
hanged
for
murder
with
such
a
misfortune
as
this
presenting
itself
as
a
possible
prospect
the
minister
was
bound
to
prevent
the
girls
from
ignorantly
betraying
each
other
by
allusions
to
their
ages
and
their
birthdays
after
much
thought
he
had
devised
a
desperate
means
of
meeting
the
difficulty
already
made
known
as
i
am
told
for
the
information
of
strangers
who
may
read
the
pages
that
have
gone
before
mine
my
friend
s
plan
of
proceeding
had
by
the
nature
of
it
exposed
him
to
injurious
comment
to
embarrassing
questions
and
to
doubts
and
misconceptions
all
patiently
endured
in
consideration
of
the
security
that
had
been
attained
proud
of
his
explanation
gracedieu
s
vanity
called
upon
me
to
acknowledge
that
my
curiosity
had
been
satisfied
and
my
doubts
completely
set
at
rest
no
my
obstinate
common
sense
was
not
reduced
to
submission
even
yet
looking
back
over
a
lapse
of
seventeen
years
i
asked
what
had
happened
in
that
long
interval
to
justify
the
anxieties
which
still
appeared
to
trouble
my
friend
this
time
my
harmless
curiosity
could
be
gratified
by
a
reply
expressed
in
three
words
nothing
had
happened
then
what
in
heaven
s
name
was
the
minister
afraid
of
his
voice
dropped
to
a
whisper
he
said
i
am
afraid
of
the
who
were
the
women
two
of
them
actually
proved
to
be
the
servants
employed
in
gracedieu
s
house
at
the
bygone
time
when
he
had
brought
the
child
home
with
him
from
the
prison
to
point
out
the
absurdity
of
the
reasons
that
he
gave
for
fearing
what
female
curiosity
might
yet
attempt
if
circumstances
happened
to
encourage
it
would
have
been
a
mere
waste
of
words
dismissing
the
subject
i
next
ascertained
that
the
minister
s
doubts
extended
even
to
the
two
female
warders
who
had
been
appointed
to
watch
the
murderess
in
turn
during
her
last
days
in
prison
i
easily
relieved
his
mind
in
this
case
one
of
the
warders
was
dead
the
other
had
married
a
farmer
in
australia
had
we
exhausted
the
list
of
suspected
persons
yet
no
there
was
one
more
left
and
the
minister
declared
that
he
had
first
met
with
her
in
my
official
residence
at
the
time
when
i
was
governor
of
the
prison
she
presented
herself
to
me
by
name
he
said
and
she
spoke
rudely
a
miss
he
paused
to
consult
his
memory
and
this
time
thanks
perhaps
to
his
night
s
rest
his
memory
answered
the
appeal
i
have
got
it
he
cried
miss
my
friend
had
interested
me
in
his
imaginary
perils
at
last
it
was
just
possible
that
he
might
have
a
formidable
person
to
deal
with
now
during
my
residence
at
florence
the
chaplain
and
i
had
taken
many
a
retrospective
look
as
old
men
will
at
past
events
in
our
lives
my
former
colleague
spoke
of
the
time
when
he
had
performed
clerical
duty
for
his
friend
the
rector
of
a
parish
church
in
london
neither
he
nor
i
had
heard
again
of
the
miss
chance
of
our
disagreeable
prison
experience
whom
he
had
married
to
the
dashing
dutch
gentleman
tenbruggen
we
could
only
wonder
what
had
become
of
that
mysterious
married
pair
gracedieu
being
undoubtedly
ignorant
of
the
woman
s
marriage
it
was
not
easy
to
say
what
the
consequence
might
be
in
his
excitable
state
if
i
informed
him
of
it
he
would
in
all
probability
conclude
that
i
knew
more
of
the
woman
than
he
did
i
decided
on
keeping
my
own
counsel
for
the
present
at
least
passing
at
once
therefore
to
the
one
consideration
of
any
importance
i
endeavored
to
find
out
whether
gracedieu
and
tenbruggen
had
met
or
had
communicated
with
each
other
in
any
way
during
the
long
period
of
separation
that
had
taken
place
between
the
minister
and
myself
if
he
had
been
so
unlucky
as
to
offend
her
she
was
beyond
all
doubt
an
enemy
to
be
dreaded
apart
however
from
a
misfortune
of
this
kind
she
would
rank
in
my
opinion
with
the
other
harmless
objects
of
gracedieu
s
distrust
in
making
my
inquiries
i
found
that
i
had
an
obstacle
to
contend
with
while
he
felt
the
renovating
influence
of
the
repose
that
he
enjoyed
the
minister
had
been
able
to
think
and
to
express
himself
with
less
difficulty
than
usual
but
the
reserves
of
strength
on
which
the
useful
exercise
of
his
memory
depended
began
to
fail
him
as
the
interview
proceeded
he
distinctly
recollected
that
something
unpleasant
had
passed
between
that
audacious
woman
and
but
at
what
date
and
whether
by
word
of
mouth
or
by
correspondence
was
more
than
his
memory
could
now
recall
he
believed
he
was
not
mistaken
in
telling
me
that
he
had
been
in
two
minds
about
at
one
time
he
was
satisfied
that
he
had
taken
wise
measures
for
his
own
security
if
she
attempted
to
annoy
him
but
there
was
another
and
a
later
time
when
doubts
and
fears
had
laid
hold
of
him
again
if
i
wanted
to
know
how
this
had
happened
he
fancied
it
was
through
a
dream
and
if
i
asked
what
the
dream
was
he
could
only
beg
and
pray
that
i
would
spare
his
poor
head
unwilling
even
yet
to
submit
unconditionally
to
defeat
it
occurred
to
me
to
try
a
last
experiment
on
my
friend
without
calling
for
any
mental
effort
on
his
own
part
the
miss
chance
of
former
days
might
by
a
bare
possibility
have
written
to
him
i
asked
accordingly
if
he
was
in
the
habit
of
keeping
his
letters
and
if
he
would
allow
me
when
he
had
rested
a
little
to
lay
them
open
before
him
so
that
he
could
look
at
the
signatures
you
might
find
the
lost
recollection
in
that
way
i
suggested
at
the
bottom
of
one
of
your
he
was
in
that
state
of
weariness
poor
fellow
in
which
a
man
will
do
anything
for
the
sake
of
peace
pointing
to
a
cabinet
in
his
room
he
gave
me
a
key
taken
from
a
little
basket
on
his
bed
look
for
yourself
he
said
after
some
hesitation
for
i
naturally
recoiled
from
examining
another
man
s
correspondence
i
decided
on
opening
the
cabinet
at
any
rate
the
letters
a
large
collection
were
to
my
relief
all
neatly
folded
and
indorsed
with
the
names
of
the
writers
i
could
run
harmlessly
through
bundle
after
bundle
in
search
of
the
one
name
that
i
wanted
and
still
respect
the
privacy
of
the
letters
my
perseverance
deserved
a
reward
and
failed
to
get
it
the
name
i
wanted
steadily
eluded
my
search
arriving
at
the
upper
shelf
of
the
cabinet
i
found
it
so
high
that
i
could
barely
reach
it
with
my
hand
instead
of
getting
more
letters
to
look
over
i
pulled
down
two
newspapers
one
of
them
was
an
old
copy
of
the
dating
back
as
far
as
the
december
it
was
carefully
folded
longwise
with
the
uppermost
on
the
first
column
at
the
side
of
the
sheet
appeared
the
customary
announcements
of
births
a
mark
with
a
blue
pencil
against
one
of
the
advertisements
attracted
my
attention
i
read
these
lines
on
the
the
wife
of
the
rev
abel
gracedieu
of
a
the
second
newspaper
bore
a
later
date
and
contained
nothing
that
interested
me
i
naturally
assumed
that
the
advertisement
in
the
had
been
inserted
at
the
desire
of
gracedieu
and
after
all
that
i
had
heard
there
was
little
difficulty
in
attributing
the
curious
omission
of
the
place
in
which
the
child
had
been
born
to
the
caution
of
her
husband
if
tenbruggen
then
miss
chance
had
happened
to
see
the
advertisement
in
the
great
london
newspaper
gracedieu
might
yet
have
good
reason
to
congratulate
himself
on
his
prudent
method
of
providing
against
mischievous
curiosity
i
turned
toward
the
bed
and
looked
at
him
his
eyes
were
closed
was
he
sleeping
or
was
he
trying
to
remember
what
he
had
desired
to
say
to
me
when
the
demands
which
i
made
on
his
memory
had
obliged
him
to
wait
for
a
later
opportunity
either
way
there
was
something
that
quickened
my
sympathies
in
the
spectacle
of
his
helpless
repose
it
suggested
to
me
personal
reasons
for
his
anxieties
which
he
had
not
mentioned
and
which
i
had
not
thought
of
up
to
this
time
if
the
discovery
that
he
dreaded
took
place
his
household
would
be
broken
up
and
his
position
as
pastor
would
suffer
in
the
estimation
of
the
flock
his
own
daughter
would
refuse
to
live
under
the
same
roof
with
the
daughter
of
an
infamous
woman
popular
opinion
among
his
congregation
judging
a
man
who
had
passed
off
the
child
of
other
parents
as
his
own
would
find
that
man
guilty
of
an
act
of
deliberate
deceit
still
oppressed
by
reflections
which
pointed
to
the
future
in
this
discouraging
way
i
was
startled
by
a
voice
outside
the
door
a
sweet
sad
voice
saying
may
i
come
in
the
minister
s
eyes
opened
instantly
he
raised
himself
in
his
bed
eunice
at
last
he
cried
let
her
chapter
xxxix
the
adopted
child
i
opened
the
door
eunice
passed
me
with
the
suddenness
almost
of
a
flash
of
light
when
i
turned
toward
the
bed
her
arms
were
round
her
father
s
neck
oh
poor
papa
how
ill
you
look
commonplace
expressions
of
fondness
and
no
more
but
the
tone
gave
them
a
charm
that
subdued
me
never
had
i
felt
so
indulgent
toward
gracedieu
s
unreasonable
fears
as
when
i
saw
him
in
the
embrace
of
his
adopted
daughter
she
had
already
reminded
me
of
the
bygone
day
when
a
bright
little
child
had
sat
on
my
knee
and
listened
to
the
ticking
of
my
watch
the
minister
gently
lifted
her
head
from
his
breast
my
darling
he
said
you
don
t
see
my
old
friend
love
him
and
look
up
to
him
eunice
he
will
be
your
friend
too
when
i
am
she
came
to
me
and
offered
her
cheek
to
be
kissed
it
was
sadly
pale
poor
soul
and
i
could
guess
why
but
her
heart
was
now
full
of
her
father
do
you
think
he
is
seriously
ill
she
whispered
what
i
ought
to
have
said
i
don
t
know
her
eyes
the
sweetest
truest
loveliest
eyes
i
ever
saw
in
a
human
face
were
pleading
with
me
let
my
enemies
make
the
worst
of
it
if
they
like
i
did
certainly
lie
and
if
i
deserved
my
punishment
i
got
it
the
poor
child
believed
me
now
i
am
happier
she
said
gratefully
only
to
hear
your
voice
seems
to
encourage
me
on
our
way
here
selina
did
nothing
but
talk
of
you
she
told
me
i
shouldn
t
have
time
to
feel
afraid
of
the
great
man
he
would
make
me
fond
of
him
directly
i
said
are
you
fond
of
him
she
said
madly
in
love
with
him
my
my
little
friend
really
thinks
you
like
her
and
is
very
proud
of
it
there
are
some
people
who
call
her
ugly
i
hope
you
don
t
agree
with
them
i
believe
i
should
have
lied
again
if
gracedieu
had
not
called
me
to
the
bedside
how
does
she
strike
you
he
whispered
eagerly
is
it
too
soon
to
ask
if
she
shows
her
age
in
her
face
neither
in
her
face
nor
her
figure
i
answered
it
astonishes
me
that
you
can
ever
have
doubted
it
no
stranger
judging
by
personal
appearance
could
fail
to
make
the
mistake
of
thinking
helena
the
oldest
of
the
he
looked
fondly
at
eunice
her
figure
seems
to
bear
out
what
you
say
he
went
on
almost
childish
isn
t
it
i
could
not
agree
to
that
slim
supple
simply
graceful
in
every
movement
eunice
s
figure
in
the
charm
of
first
youth
only
waited
its
perfect
development
most
men
looking
at
her
as
she
stood
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
with
her
back
toward
us
would
have
guessed
her
age
to
be
sixteen
finding
that
i
failed
to
agree
with
him
gracedieu
s
misgivings
returned
you
speak
very
confidently
he
said
considering
that
you
have
not
seen
the
girls
together
think
what
a
dreadful
blow
it
would
be
to
me
if
you
made
a
i
declared
with
perfect
sincerity
that
there
was
no
fear
of
a
mistake
the
bare
idea
of
making
the
proposed
comparison
was
hateful
to
me
if
helena
and
i
had
happened
to
meet
at
that
moment
i
should
have
turned
away
from
her
by
instinct
she
would
have
disturbed
my
impressions
of
eunice
the
minister
signed
to
me
to
move
a
little
nearer
to
him
i
must
say
it
he
whispered
and
i
am
afraid
of
her
hearing
me
is
there
anything
in
her
face
that
reminds
you
of
her
miserable
mother
i
had
hardly
patience
to
answer
the
question
it
was
simply
preposterous
her
hair
was
by
many
shades
darker
than
her
mother
s
hair
her
eyes
were
of
a
different
color
there
was
an
exquisite
tenderness
and
sincerity
in
their
expression
made
additionally
beautiful
to
my
mind
by
a
gentle
uncomplaining
sadness
it
was
impossible
even
to
think
of
the
eyes
of
the
murderess
when
i
looked
at
her
child
eunice
s
lower
features
again
had
none
of
her
mother
s
regularity
of
proportion
her
smile
simple
and
sweet
and
soon
passing
away
was
certainly
not
an
inherited
smile
on
the
maternal
side
whether
she
resembled
her
father
i
was
unable
to
conjecture
having
never
seen
him
the
one
thing
certain
was
that
not
the
faintest
trace
in
feature
or
expression
of
eunice
s
mother
was
to
be
seen
in
eunice
herself
of
the
two
girls
helena
judging
by
something
in
the
color
of
her
hair
and
by
something
in
the
shade
of
her
complexion
might
possibly
have
suggested
in
those
particulars
only
a
purely
accidental
resemblance
to
my
terrible
prisoner
of
past
times
the
revival
of
gracedieu
s
spirits
indicated
a
temporary
change
only
and
was
already
beginning
to
pass
away
the
eyes
which
had
looked
lovingly
at
eunice
began
to
look
languidly
now
his
head
sank
on
the
pillow
with
a
sigh
of
weak
content
my
pleasure
has
been
almost
too
much
for
me
he
said
leave
me
for
a
while
to
rest
and
get
used
to
eunice
kissed
his
forehead
and
we
left
the
room
chapter
xl
the
bruised
heart
when
we
stepped
out
on
the
landing
i
observed
that
my
companion
paused
she
looked
at
the
two
flights
of
stairs
below
us
before
she
descended
them
it
occurred
to
me
that
there
must
be
somebody
in
the
house
whom
she
was
anxious
to
avoid
arrived
at
the
lower
hall
she
paused
again
and
proposed
in
a
whisper
that
we
should
go
into
the
garden
as
we
advanced
along
the
backward
division
of
the
hall
i
saw
her
eyes
turn
distrustfully
toward
the
door
of
the
room
in
which
helena
had
received
me
at
last
my
slow
perceptions
felt
with
her
and
understood
her
eunice
s
sensitive
nature
recoiled
from
a
chance
meeting
with
the
wretch
who
had
laid
waste
all
that
had
once
been
happy
and
hopeful
in
that
harmless
young
life
will
you
come
with
me
to
the
part
of
the
garden
that
i
am
fondest
of
she
asked
i
offered
her
my
arm
she
led
me
in
silence
to
a
rustic
seat
placed
under
the
shade
of
a
mulberry
tree
i
saw
a
change
in
her
face
as
we
sat
down
a
tender
and
beautiful
change
at
that
moment
the
girl
s
heart
was
far
away
from
me
there
was
some
association
with
this
corner
of
the
garden
on
which
i
felt
that
i
must
not
intrude
i
was
once
very
happy
here
she
said
when
the
time
of
the
heartache
came
soon
after
i
was
afraid
to
look
at
the
old
tree
and
the
bench
under
it
but
that
is
all
over
now
i
like
to
remember
the
hours
that
were
once
dear
to
me
and
to
see
the
place
that
recalls
them
do
you
know
who
i
am
thinking
of
don
t
be
afraid
of
distressing
me
i
never
cry
my
dear
child
i
have
heard
your
sad
story
but
i
can
t
trust
myself
to
speak
of
because
you
are
so
sorry
for
me
no
words
can
say
how
sorry
i
am
but
you
are
not
angry
with
philip
not
angry
my
poor
dear
i
am
afraid
to
tell
you
how
angry
i
am
with
oh
no
you
mustn
t
say
that
if
you
wish
to
be
kind
to
me
and
i
am
sure
you
do
wish
it
don
t
think
bitterly
of
when
i
remember
that
the
first
feeling
she
roused
in
me
was
nothing
worthier
of
a
professing
christian
than
astonishment
i
drop
in
my
own
estimation
to
the
level
of
a
savage
do
you
really
mean
i
was
base
enough
to
ask
that
you
have
forgiven
him
she
said
gently
how
could
i
help
forgiving
him
the
man
who
could
have
been
blessed
with
such
love
as
this
and
who
could
have
cast
it
away
from
him
can
have
been
nothing
but
an
idiot
on
that
ground
though
i
dared
not
confess
it
to
eunice
i
forgave
him
too
do
i
surprise
you
she
asked
simply
perhaps
love
will
bear
any
humiliation
or
perhaps
i
am
only
a
poor
weak
creature
you
don
t
know
what
a
comfort
it
was
to
me
to
keep
the
few
letters
that
i
received
from
philip
when
i
heard
that
he
had
gone
away
i
gave
his
letters
the
kiss
that
bade
him
that
was
the
time
i
think
when
my
poor
bruised
heart
got
used
to
the
pain
i
began
to
feel
that
there
was
one
consolation
still
left
for
me
i
might
end
in
forgiving
him
why
do
i
tell
you
all
this
i
think
you
must
have
bewitched
me
is
this
really
the
first
time
i
have
seen
you
she
put
her
little
trembling
hand
into
mine
i
lifted
it
to
my
lips
and
kissed
it
sorely
was
i
tempted
to
own
that
i
had
pitied
and
loved
her
in
her
infancy
it
was
almost
on
my
lips
to
say
i
remember
you
an
little
creature
amusing
yourself
with
the
broken
toys
which
were
once
the
playthings
of
my
own
i
believe
i
should
have
said
it
if
i
could
have
trusted
myself
to
speak
composedly
to
her
this
was
not
to
be
done
old
as
i
was
versed
as
i
was
in
the
hard
knowledge
of
how
to
keep
the
mask
on
in
the
hour
of
need
this
was
not
to
be
done
still
trying
to
understand
that
i
was
little
better
than
a
stranger
to
her
and
still
bent
on
finding
the
secret
of
the
sympathy
that
united
us
eunice
put
a
strange
question
to
me
when
you
were
young
yourself
she
said
did
you
know
what
it
was
to
love
and
to
be
loved
and
then
to
lose
it
all
it
is
not
given
to
many
men
to
marry
the
woman
who
has
been
the
object
of
their
first
love
my
early
life
had
been
darkened
by
a
sad
story
never
confided
to
any
living
creature
banished
resolutely
from
my
own
thoughts
for
forty
years
past
that
part
of
my
buried
self
had
lain
quiet
in
its
grave
and
the
chance
touch
of
an
innocent
hand
had
raised
the
dead
and
set
us
face
to
face
again
did
i
know
what
it
was
to
love
and
to
be
loved
and
then
to
lose
it
all
too
well
my
child
too
well
that
was
all
i
could
say
to
her
in
the
last
days
of
my
life
i
shrank
from
speaking
of
it
when
i
had
first
felt
that
calamity
and
had
felt
it
most
keenly
i
might
have
given
an
answer
worthier
of
me
and
worthier
of
her
she
dropped
my
hand
and
sat
by
me
in
silence
thinking
had
i
without
meaning
it
god
knows
had
i
disappointed
her
did
you
expect
me
to
tell
my
own
sad
story
i
said
as
frankly
and
as
trustfully
as
you
have
told
yours
oh
don
t
think
that
i
know
what
an
effort
it
was
to
you
to
answer
me
at
all
yes
indeed
i
wonder
whether
i
may
ask
something
the
sorrow
you
have
just
told
me
of
is
not
the
only
one
is
it
you
have
had
other
troubles
many
of
there
are
times
she
went
on
when
one
can
t
help
thinking
of
one
s
own
miserable
self
i
try
to
be
cheerful
but
those
times
come
now
and
she
stopped
and
looked
at
me
with
a
pale
fear
confessing
itself
in
her
face
you
know
who
selina
is
she
resumed
my
friend
the
only
friend
i
had
till
you
came
i
guessed
that
she
was
speaking
of
the
quaint
kindly
little
woman
whose
ugly
surname
had
been
hitherto
the
only
name
known
to
me
selina
has
i
daresay
told
you
that
i
have
been
ill
she
continued
and
that
i
am
staying
in
the
country
for
the
benefit
of
my
it
was
plain
that
she
had
something
to
say
to
me
far
more
important
than
this
and
that
she
was
dwelling
on
trifles
to
gain
time
and
courage
hoping
to
help
her
i
dwelt
on
trifles
too
asking
commonplace
questions
about
the
part
of
the
country
in
which
she
was
staying
she
answered
absently
then
little
by
little
impatiently
the
one
poor
proof
of
kindness
that
i
could
offer
now
was
to
say
no
more
do
you
know
what
a
strange
creature
i
am
she
broke
out
shall
i
make
you
angry
with
me
or
shall
i
make
you
laugh
at
me
what
i
have
shrunk
from
confessing
to
selina
what
i
dare
not
confess
to
my
father
i
must
and
will
confess
to
there
was
a
look
of
horror
in
her
face
that
alarmed
me
i
drew
her
to
me
so
that
she
could
rest
her
head
on
my
shoulder
my
own
agitation
threatened
to
get
the
better
of
me
for
the
first
time
since
i
had
seen
this
sweet
girl
i
found
myself
thinking
of
the
blood
that
ran
in
her
veins
and
of
the
nature
of
the
mother
who
had
borne
her
did
you
notice
how
i
behaved
upstairs
she
said
i
mean
when
we
left
my
father
and
came
out
on
the
it
was
easily
recollected
i
begged
her
to
go
on
before
i
went
downstairs
she
proceeded
you
saw
me
look
and
listen
did
you
think
i
was
afraid
of
meeting
some
person
and
did
you
guess
who
it
was
i
wanted
to
avoid
i
guessed
that
and
i
understood
no
you
are
not
wicked
enough
to
understand
me
will
you
do
me
a
favor
i
want
you
to
look
at
it
was
said
seriously
she
lifted
her
head
for
a
moment
so
that
i
could
examine
her
face
do
you
see
anything
she
asked
which
makes
you
fear
that
i
am
not
in
my
right
mind
good
god
how
can
you
ask
such
a
horrible
question
she
laid
her
head
back
on
my
shoulder
with
a
sad
little
sigh
of
resignation
i
ought
to
have
known
better
she
said
there
is
no
such
easy
way
out
of
it
as
that
tell
me
is
there
one
kind
of
wickedness
more
deceitful
than
another
can
it
be
hid
in
a
person
for
years
together
and
show
itself
when
a
time
of
suffering
no
i
mean
when
a
sense
of
injury
comes
did
you
ever
see
that
when
you
were
master
in
the
prison
i
had
seen
it
and
after
a
moment
s
doubt
i
said
i
had
seen
it
did
you
pity
those
poor
wretches
certainly
they
deserved
i
am
one
of
them
she
said
pity
if
helena
looks
at
me
if
helena
speaks
to
me
if
i
only
see
helena
by
accident
do
you
know
what
she
does
she
tempts
me
tempts
me
to
do
dreadful
things
tempts
me
the
poor
child
threw
her
arms
round
my
neck
and
whispered
the
next
fatal
words
in
my
ear
the
mother
prepared
as
i
was
for
the
accursed
discovery
the
horror
of
it
shook
me
she
left
me
and
started
to
her
feet
the
inherited
energy
showed
itself
in
furious
protest
against
the
inherited
evil
what
does
it
mean
she
cried
i
ll
submit
to
anything
i
ll
bear
my
hard
lot
patiently
if
you
will
only
tell
me
what
it
means
where
does
this
horrid
transformation
of
me
out
of
myself
come
from
look
at
my
good
father
in
all
this
world
there
is
no
man
so
perfect
as
he
is
and
oh
how
he
has
taught
me
there
isn
t
a
single
good
thing
that
i
have
not
learned
from
him
since
i
was
a
little
child
did
you
ever
hear
him
speak
of
my
mother
you
must
have
heard
him
my
mother
was
an
angel
i
could
never
be
worthy
of
her
at
my
best
but
i
have
tried
i
have
tried
the
wickedest
girl
in
the
world
doesn
t
have
worse
thoughts
than
the
thoughts
that
have
come
to
me
since
when
since
helena
oh
how
can
i
call
her
by
her
name
as
if
i
still
loved
her
since
my
sister
can
she
be
my
sister
i
ask
myself
sometimes
since
my
enemy
there
s
the
word
for
her
since
my
enemy
took
philip
away
from
me
what
does
it
mean
i
have
asked
in
my
prayers
and
have
got
no
answer
i
ask
you
what
does
it
mean
you
must
tell
me
you
shall
tell
me
what
does
it
mean
why
did
i
not
try
to
calm
her
i
had
vainly
tried
to
calm
her
i
who
knew
who
her
mother
was
and
what
her
mother
had
been
at
last
she
had
forced
the
sense
of
my
duty
on
me
the
simplest
way
of
calming
her
was
to
put
her
back
in
the
place
by
my
side
that
she
had
left
it
was
useless
to
reason
with
her
it
was
impossible
to
answer
her
i
had
my
own
idea
of
the
one
way
in
which
i
might
charm
eunice
back
to
her
sweeter
self
let
us
talk
of
philip
i
said
the
fierce
flush
on
her
face
softened
the
swelling
trouble
of
her
bosom
began
to
subside
as
that
name
passed
my
lips
but
there
was
some
influence
left
in
her
which
resisted
me
no
she
said
we
had
better
not
talk
of
why
not
i
have
lost
all
my
courage
if
you
speak
of
philip
you
will
make
me
i
drew
her
nearer
to
me
if
she
had
been
my
own
child
i
don
t
think
i
could
have
felt
for
her
more
truly
than
i
felt
at
that
moment
i
only
looked
at
her
i
only
said
cry
the
love
that
was
in
her
heart
rose
and
poured
its
tenderness
into
her
eyes
i
had
longed
to
see
the
tears
that
would
comfort
her
the
tears
came
there
was
silence
between
us
for
a
while
it
was
possible
for
me
to
think
in
the
absence
of
physical
resemblance
between
parent
and
child
is
an
unfavorable
influence
exercised
on
the
tendency
to
moral
resemblance
assuming
the
possibility
of
such
a
result
as
this
eunice
entirely
unlike
her
mother
must
as
i
concluded
have
been
possessed
of
qualities
formed
to
resist
as
well
as
of
qualities
doomed
to
undergo
the
infection
of
evil
while
therefore
i
resigned
myself
to
recognize
the
existence
of
the
hereditary
maternal
taint
i
firmly
believed
in
the
counterbalancing
influences
for
good
which
had
been
part
of
the
girl
s
birthright
they
had
been
derived
perhaps
from
the
better
qualities
in
her
father
s
nature
they
had
been
certainly
developed
by
the
tender
care
the
religious
vigilance
which
had
guarded
the
adopted
child
so
lovingly
in
the
minister
s
household
and
they
had
served
their
purpose
until
time
brought
with
it
the
change
for
which
the
tranquil
domestic
influences
were
not
prepared
with
the
great
the
vital
transformation
which
marks
the
ripening
of
the
girl
into
the
woman
s
maturity
of
thought
and
passion
a
new
power
for
good
strong
enough
to
resist
the
latent
power
for
evil
sprang
into
being
and
sheltered
eunice
under
the
supremacy
of
love
love
and
but
love
that
no
profanation
could
stain
that
no
hereditary
evil
could
conquer
the
true
love
that
had
been
and
was
and
would
be
the
guardian
angel
of
eunice
s
life
if
i
am
asked
whether
i
have
ventured
to
found
this
opinion
on
what
i
have
observed
in
one
instance
only
i
reply
that
i
have
had
other
opportunities
of
investigation
and
that
my
conclusions
are
derived
from
experience
which
refers
to
more
instances
than
one
no
man
in
his
senses
can
doubt
that
physical
qualities
are
transmitted
from
parents
to
children
but
inheritance
of
moral
qualities
is
less
easy
to
trace
here
the
exploring
mind
finds
its
progress
beset
by
obstacles
that
those
obstacles
have
been
sometimes
overcome
i
do
not
deny
moral
resemblances
have
been
traced
between
parents
and
children
while
however
i
admit
this
i
doubt
the
conclusion
which
sees
in
inheritance
of
moral
qualities
a
positive
influence
exercised
on
moral
destiny
there
are
inherent
emotional
forces
in
humanity
to
which
the
inherited
influences
must
submit
they
are
essentially
influences
under
control
influences
which
can
be
encountered
and
forced
back
that
we
who
inhabit
this
little
planet
may
be
the
doomed
creatures
of
fatality
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
i
am
not
prepared
to
dispute
but
i
absolutely
refuse
to
believe
that
it
is
a
fatality
with
no
higher
origin
than
can
be
found
in
our
accidental
obligation
to
our
fathers
and
mothers
still
absorbed
in
these
speculations
i
was
disturbed
by
a
touch
on
my
arm
i
looked
up
eunice
s
eyes
were
fixed
on
a
shrubbery
at
some
little
distance
from
us
which
closed
the
view
of
the
garden
on
that
side
i
noticed
that
she
was
trembling
nothing
to
alarm
her
was
visible
that
i
could
discover
i
asked
what
she
had
seen
to
startle
her
she
pointed
to
the
shrubbery
look
again
she
said
this
time
i
saw
a
woman
s
dress
among
the
shrubs
the
woman
herself
appeared
in
a
moment
more
it
was
helena
she
carried
a
small
portfolio
and
she
approached
us
with
a
smile
chapter
xli
the
whispering
voice
i
looked
at
eunice
she
had
risen
startled
by
her
first
suspicion
of
the
person
who
was
approaching
us
through
the
shrubbery
but
she
kept
her
place
near
me
only
changing
her
position
so
as
to
avoid
confronting
helena
her
quickened
breathing
was
all
that
told
me
of
the
effort
she
was
making
to
preserve
her
entirely
free
from
unbecoming
signs
of
hurry
and
agitation
helena
opened
her
business
with
me
by
means
of
an
apology
pray
excuse
me
for
disturbing
you
i
am
obliged
to
leave
the
house
on
one
of
my
tiresome
domestic
errands
if
you
will
kindly
permit
it
i
wish
to
express
before
i
go
my
very
sincere
regret
for
what
i
was
rude
enough
to
say
when
i
last
had
the
honor
of
seeing
you
may
i
hope
to
be
forgiven
eunice
have
you
enjoyed
your
holiday
in
the
country
eunice
neither
moved
nor
answered
having
some
doubt
of
what
might
happen
if
the
two
girls
remained
together
i
proposed
to
helena
to
leave
the
garden
and
to
let
me
hear
what
she
had
to
say
in
the
house
quite
needless
she
replied
i
shall
not
detain
you
for
more
than
a
minute
please
look
at
she
offered
to
me
the
portfolio
that
she
had
been
carrying
and
pointed
to
a
morsel
of
paper
attached
to
it
which
contained
this
inscription
philip
s
letters
to
me
private
helena
i
have
a
favor
to
ask
she
said
and
a
proof
of
confidence
in
you
to
offer
will
you
be
so
good
as
to
look
over
what
you
find
in
my
portfolio
i
am
unwilling
to
give
up
the
hopes
that
i
had
founded
on
our
interview
when
i
asked
for
it
the
letters
will
i
venture
to
think
plead
my
cause
more
convincingly
than
i
was
able
to
plead
it
for
myself
i
wish
to
forget
what
passed
between
us
to
the
last
word
to
the
last
word
she
repeated
emphatically
with
a
look
which
sufficiently
informed
me
that
i
had
not
been
betrayed
to
her
father
yet
will
you
indulge
me
she
asked
and
offered
her
portfolio
for
the
second
time
a
more
impudent
bargain
could
not
well
have
been
proposed
to
me
i
was
to
read
and
to
be
favorably
impressed
by
philip
dunboyne
s
letters
and
miss
helena
was
to
say
nothing
of
that
unlucky
slip
of
the
tongue
relating
to
her
mother
which
she
had
discovered
to
be
a
serious
act
of
thanks
to
my
confusion
at
the
time
if
i
had
not
thought
of
eunice
and
of
the
desolate
and
loveless
life
to
which
the
poor
girl
was
so
patiently
resigned
i
should
have
refused
to
read
miss
gracedieu
s
but
as
things
were
i
was
influenced
by
the
hope
innocently
encouraged
by
eunice
herself
that
philip
dunboyne
might
not
be
so
wholly
unworthy
of
the
sweet
girl
whom
he
had
injured
as
i
had
hitherto
been
too
hastily
disposed
to
believe
to
act
on
this
view
with
the
purpose
of
promoting
a
reconciliation
was
impossible
unless
i
had
the
means
of
forming
a
correct
estimate
of
the
man
s
character
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
found
the
means
a
fair
chance
of
putting
his
sincerity
to
a
trustworthy
test
was
surely
offered
by
the
letters
the
confidential
letters
which
i
had
been
requested
to
read
to
feel
this
as
strongly
as
i
felt
it
brought
me
at
once
to
a
decision
i
consented
to
take
the
portfolio
on
my
own
conditions
understand
miss
helena
i
said
that
i
make
no
promises
i
reserve
my
own
opinion
and
my
own
right
of
i
am
not
afraid
of
your
opinions
or
your
actions
she
answered
confidently
if
you
will
only
read
the
letters
in
the
meantime
let
me
relieve
my
sister
there
of
my
presence
i
hope
you
will
soon
recover
eunice
in
the
country
if
the
object
of
the
wretch
was
to
exasperate
her
victim
she
had
completely
failed
eunice
remained
as
still
as
a
statue
to
all
appearance
she
had
not
even
heard
what
had
been
said
to
her
helena
looked
at
me
and
touched
her
forehead
with
a
significant
smile
sad
isn
t
it
she
said
and
bowed
and
went
briskly
away
on
her
household
errand
we
were
alone
again
still
eunice
never
moved
i
spoke
to
her
and
produced
no
impression
beginning
to
feel
alarmed
i
tried
the
effect
of
touching
her
with
a
wild
cry
she
started
into
a
state
of
animation
almost
at
the
same
moment
she
weakly
swayed
to
and
fro
as
if
the
pleasant
breeze
in
the
garden
moved
her
at
its
will
like
the
flowers
i
held
her
up
and
led
her
to
the
seat
there
is
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
i
said
she
has
eunice
s
eyes
rested
on
me
in
vacant
surprise
how
do
you
know
she
asked
i
hear
her
but
i
never
see
her
do
you
see
her
my
dear
child
of
what
person
are
you
speaking
she
answered
of
no
person
i
am
speaking
of
a
voice
that
whispers
and
tempts
me
when
helena
is
what
voice
eunice
the
whispering
voice
it
said
to
me
i
am
your
mother
it
called
me
daughter
when
i
first
heard
it
my
father
speaks
of
my
mother
the
angel
that
good
spirit
has
never
come
to
me
from
the
better
world
it
is
a
who
comes
to
me
some
spirit
of
evil
listen
to
this
i
was
awake
in
my
bed
in
the
dark
i
heard
the
whispering
close
at
my
ear
shall
i
tell
you
how
she
answered
me
when
i
longed
for
light
to
see
her
by
when
i
prayed
to
her
to
show
herself
to
me
she
said
my
face
was
hidden
when
i
passed
from
life
to
death
my
face
no
mortal
creature
may
i
have
never
seen
her
how
can
have
seen
her
but
i
heard
her
again
just
now
she
whispered
to
me
when
helena
was
standing
there
where
you
are
standing
she
freezes
the
life
in
me
did
she
freeze
the
life
in
did
you
hear
her
tempting
me
don
t
speak
of
it
if
you
did
oh
not
a
word
not
a
word
a
man
who
has
governed
a
prison
may
say
with
macbeth
i
have
supped
full
with
hardened
as
i
was
or
ought
to
have
been
the
effect
of
what
i
had
just
heard
turned
me
cold
if
i
had
not
known
it
to
be
absolutely
impossible
i
might
have
believed
that
the
crime
and
the
death
of
the
murderess
were
known
to
eunice
as
being
the
crime
and
the
death
of
her
mother
and
that
the
horrid
discovery
had
turned
her
brain
this
was
simply
impossible
what
did
it
mean
good
god
what
did
it
mean
my
sense
of
my
own
helplessness
was
the
first
sense
in
me
that
recovered
i
thought
of
eunice
s
devoted
little
friend
a
woman
s
sympathy
seemed
to
be
needed
now
i
rose
to
lead
the
way
out
of
the
garden
selina
will
think
we
are
lost
i
said
let
us
go
and
find
not
for
the
world
she
cried
why
not
because
i
don
t
feel
sure
of
myself
i
might
tell
selina
something
which
she
must
never
know
i
should
be
so
sorry
to
frighten
her
let
me
stop
here
with
i
resumed
my
place
at
her
side
let
me
take
your
i
gave
her
my
hand
what
composing
influence
this
simple
act
may
or
may
not
have
exercised
it
is
impossible
to
say
she
was
quiet
she
was
silent
after
an
interval
i
heard
her
breathe
a
sigh
of
relief
i
am
afraid
i
have
surprised
you
she
said
helena
brings
the
dreadful
time
back
to
me
she
stopped
and
shuddered
don
t
speak
of
helena
my
but
i
am
afraid
you
will
think
because
i
have
said
strange
things
that
i
have
been
talking
at
random
she
insisted
the
doctor
will
say
that
if
you
meet
with
him
he
believes
i
am
deluded
by
a
dream
i
tried
to
think
so
myself
it
was
of
no
use
i
am
quite
sure
he
is
i
privately
determined
to
watch
for
the
doctor
s
arrival
and
to
consult
with
him
eunice
went
on
i
have
the
story
of
a
terrible
night
to
tell
you
but
i
haven
t
the
courage
to
tell
it
now
why
shouldn
t
you
come
back
with
me
to
the
place
that
i
am
staying
at
a
pleasant
and
such
kind
people
you
might
read
the
account
of
that
night
in
my
journal
i
shall
not
regret
the
misery
of
having
written
it
if
it
helps
you
to
find
out
how
this
hateful
second
self
of
mine
has
come
to
me
hush
i
want
to
ask
you
something
do
you
think
helena
is
in
the
house
no
she
has
gone
did
she
say
that
herself
are
you
sure
quite
she
decided
on
going
back
to
the
farm
while
helena
was
out
of
the
way
we
left
the
garden
together
for
the
first
time
my
companion
noticed
the
portfolio
i
happened
to
be
carrying
it
in
the
hand
that
was
nearest
to
her
as
she
walked
by
my
side
where
did
you
get
that
she
asked
it
was
needless
to
reply
in
words
my
hesitation
spoke
for
me
carry
it
in
your
other
hand
she
said
the
hand
that
s
furthest
away
from
me
i
don
t
want
to
see
it
do
you
mind
waiting
a
moment
while
i
find
selina
you
will
go
to
the
farm
with
us
won
t
you
i
had
to
look
over
the
letters
in
eunice
s
own
interests
and
i
begged
her
to
let
me
defer
my
visit
to
the
farm
until
the
next
day
she
consented
after
making
me
promise
to
keep
my
appointment
it
was
of
some
importance
to
her
she
told
me
that
i
should
make
acquaintance
with
the
farmer
and
his
wife
and
children
and
tell
her
how
i
liked
them
her
plans
for
the
future
depended
on
what
those
good
people
might
be
willing
to
do
when
she
had
recovered
her
health
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
go
home
again
while
helena
remained
in
the
house
she
had
resolved
to
earn
her
own
living
if
she
could
get
employment
as
a
governess
the
farmer
s
children
liked
her
she
had
already
helped
their
mother
in
teaching
them
and
there
was
reason
to
hope
that
their
father
would
see
his
way
to
employing
her
permanently
his
house
offered
the
great
advantage
of
being
near
enough
to
the
town
to
enable
her
to
hear
news
of
the
minister
s
progress
toward
recovery
and
to
see
him
herself
when
safe
opportunities
offered
from
time
to
time
as
for
her
salary
what
did
she
care
about
money
anything
would
be
acceptable
if
the
good
man
would
only
realize
her
hopes
for
the
future
it
was
disheartening
to
hear
that
hope
at
her
age
began
and
ended
within
such
narrow
limits
as
these
no
prudent
man
would
have
tried
to
persuade
her
as
i
now
did
that
the
idea
of
reconciliation
offered
the
better
hope
of
the
two
suppose
i
see
philip
dunboyne
when
i
go
back
to
london
i
began
what
shall
i
say
to
him
say
i
have
forgiven
and
suppose
i
went
on
that
the
blame
really
rests
where
you
all
believe
it
to
rest
with
helena
if
that
young
man
returns
to
you
truly
ashamed
of
himself
truly
penitent
will
you
she
resolutely
interrupted
me
no
oh
eunice
you
surely
mean
yes
i
mean
no
why
don
t
ask
me
till
chapter
xlii
the
quaint
philosopher
no
person
came
to
my
room
and
nothing
happened
to
interrupt
me
while
i
was
reading
philip
dunboyne
s
letters
one
of
them
let
me
say
at
once
produced
a
very
disagreeable
impression
on
me
i
have
unexpectedly
discovered
tenbruggen
in
a
postscript
she
is
making
a
living
as
a
medical
rubber
or
masseuse
and
is
in
professional
attendance
on
dunboyne
the
elder
more
of
this
a
little
further
on
having
gone
through
the
whole
collection
of
young
dunboyne
s
letters
i
set
myself
to
review
the
differing
conclusions
which
the
correspondence
had
produced
on
my
mind
i
call
the
papers
submitted
to
me
a
correspondence
because
the
greater
part
of
philip
s
letters
exhibit
notes
in
pencil
evidently
added
by
helena
these
express
for
the
most
part
the
interpretation
which
she
had
placed
on
passages
that
perplexed
or
displeased
her
and
they
have
as
philip
s
rejoinders
show
been
employed
as
materials
when
she
wrote
her
replies
on
reflection
i
find
myself
troubled
by
complexities
and
contradictions
in
the
view
presented
of
this
young
man
s
character
to
decide
positively
whether
i
can
justify
to
myself
and
to
my
regard
for
eunice
an
attempt
to
reunite
the
lovers
requires
more
time
for
consideration
than
i
can
reasonably
expect
that
helena
s
patience
will
allow
having
a
quiet
hour
or
two
still
before
me
i
have
determined
to
make
extracts
from
the
letters
for
my
own
use
with
the
intention
of
referring
to
them
while
i
am
still
in
doubt
which
way
my
decision
ought
to
incline
i
shall
present
them
here
to
speak
for
themselves
is
there
any
objection
to
this
none
that
i
can
see
in
the
first
place
those
extracts
have
a
value
of
their
own
they
add
necessary
information
to
the
present
history
of
events
in
the
second
place
i
am
under
no
obligation
to
gracedieu
s
daughter
which
forbids
me
to
make
use
of
her
portfolio
i
told
her
that
i
only
consented
to
receive
it
under
reserve
of
my
own
right
of
action
and
her
assent
to
that
stipulation
was
expressed
in
the
clearest
terms
extracts
from
philip
dunboyne
s
letters
first
extract
you
blame
me
dear
helena
for
not
having
paid
proper
attention
to
the
questions
put
to
me
in
your
last
letter
i
have
only
been
waiting
to
make
up
my
mind
before
i
replied
first
question
do
i
think
it
advisable
that
you
should
write
to
my
father
no
my
dear
i
beg
you
will
defer
writing
until
you
hear
from
me
again
second
question
considering
that
he
is
still
a
stranger
to
you
is
there
any
harm
in
your
asking
me
what
sort
of
man
my
father
is
no
harm
my
sweet
one
but
as
you
will
presently
see
i
am
afraid
you
have
addressed
yourself
to
the
wrong
person
my
father
is
kind
in
his
own
odd
way
and
learned
and
rich
a
more
and
honorable
man
as
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
doesn
t
live
but
if
you
ask
me
which
he
prefers
his
books
or
his
son
i
hope
i
do
him
no
injustice
when
i
answer
his
books
his
reading
and
his
writing
are
obstacles
between
us
which
i
have
never
been
able
to
overcome
this
is
the
more
to
be
regretted
because
he
is
charming
on
the
few
occasions
when
i
find
him
disengaged
if
you
wish
i
knew
more
about
my
father
we
are
in
complete
agreement
as
usual
i
wish
too
but
there
is
a
dear
friend
of
yours
and
mine
who
is
just
the
person
we
want
to
help
us
need
i
say
that
i
allude
to
staveley
i
called
on
her
yesterday
not
long
after
she
had
paid
a
visit
to
my
father
luck
had
favored
her
she
arrived
just
at
the
time
when
hunger
had
obliged
him
to
shut
up
his
books
and
ring
for
something
to
eat
staveley
secured
a
favorable
reception
with
her
customary
tact
and
delicacy
he
had
a
fowl
for
his
dinner
she
knows
his
weakness
of
old
she
volunteered
to
carve
it
for
him
if
i
can
only
repeat
what
this
clever
woman
told
me
of
their
talk
you
will
have
a
portrait
of
dunboyne
the
elder
not
perhaps
a
picture
but
as
i
hope
and
believe
a
good
likeness
staveley
began
by
complaining
to
him
of
the
conduct
of
his
son
i
had
promised
to
write
to
her
and
i
had
never
kept
my
word
she
had
reasons
for
being
especially
interested
in
my
plans
and
prospects
just
then
knowing
me
to
be
attached
please
take
notice
that
i
am
quoting
her
own
language
to
a
charming
friend
of
hers
whom
i
had
first
met
at
her
house
to
aggravate
the
disappointment
that
i
had
inflicted
the
young
lady
had
neglected
her
too
no
letters
no
information
perhaps
my
father
would
kindly
enlighten
her
was
the
affair
going
on
or
was
it
broken
off
my
father
held
out
his
plate
and
asked
for
the
other
wing
of
the
fowl
it
isn
t
a
bad
one
for
london
he
said
won
t
you
have
some
yourself
i
don
t
seem
to
have
interested
you
staveley
remarked
what
did
you
expect
me
to
be
interested
in
my
father
inquired
i
was
absorbed
in
the
fowl
favor
me
by
returning
to
the
staveley
admits
that
she
answered
this
rather
sharply
the
subject
sir
was
your
son
s
admiration
for
a
charming
girl
one
of
the
daughters
of
gracedieu
the
famous
my
father
is
too
to
speak
to
a
lady
while
his
attention
is
absorbed
by
a
fowl
he
finished
the
second
wing
and
then
he
asked
if
philip
was
engaged
to
be
i
am
not
quite
sure
staveley
confessed
then
my
dear
friend
we
will
wait
till
we
but
dunboyne
there
is
really
no
need
to
wait
i
suppose
your
son
comes
here
now
and
then
to
see
you
my
son
is
most
attentive
in
course
of
time
he
will
contrive
to
hit
on
the
right
hour
for
his
visit
at
present
poor
fellow
he
interrupts
me
every
suppose
he
hits
upon
the
right
time
yes
you
might
ask
him
if
he
is
engaged
pardon
me
i
think
i
might
wait
till
philip
mentions
it
without
what
an
extraordinary
man
you
are
oh
no
no
only
a
this
tried
staveley
s
temper
you
know
what
a
perfectly
candid
person
our
friend
is
she
owned
to
me
that
she
felt
inclined
to
make
herself
disagreeable
that
s
thrown
away
upon
me
she
said
i
don
t
know
what
a
philosopher
let
me
pause
for
a
moment
dear
helena
i
have
inexcusably
forgotten
to
speak
of
my
father
s
personal
appearance
it
won
t
take
long
i
need
only
notice
one
interesting
feature
which
so
to
speak
lifts
his
face
out
of
the
common
he
has
an
eloquent
nose
persons
possessing
this
rare
advantage
are
blest
with
powers
of
expression
not
granted
to
their
ordinary
my
father
s
nose
is
a
mine
of
information
to
friends
familiarly
acquainted
with
it
it
changes
color
like
a
modest
young
lady
s
cheek
it
works
flexibly
from
side
to
side
like
the
rudder
of
a
ship
on
the
present
occasion
staveley
saw
it
shift
toward
the
side
of
his
face
a
sigh
escaped
the
poor
lady
experience
told
her
that
my
father
was
going
to
hold
forth
you
don
t
know
what
a
philosopher
is
he
repeated
be
so
kind
as
to
look
at
me
i
am
a
staveley
bowed
and
a
philosopher
my
charming
friend
is
a
man
who
has
discovered
a
system
of
life
some
systems
assert
themselves
in
volumes
system
asserts
itself
in
two
words
never
think
of
anything
until
you
have
first
asked
yourself
if
there
is
an
absolute
necessity
for
doing
it
at
that
particular
moment
thinking
of
things
when
things
needn
t
be
thought
of
is
offering
an
opportunity
to
worry
and
worry
is
the
favorite
agent
of
death
when
the
destroyer
handles
his
work
in
a
lingering
way
and
achieves
premature
results
never
look
back
and
never
look
forward
as
long
as
you
can
possibly
help
it
looking
back
leads
the
way
to
sorrow
and
looking
forward
ends
in
the
cruelest
of
all
delusions
it
encourages
hope
the
present
time
is
the
precious
time
live
for
the
passing
day
the
passing
day
is
all
that
we
can
be
sure
of
you
suggested
just
now
that
i
should
ask
my
son
if
he
was
engaged
to
be
married
how
do
we
know
what
wear
and
tear
of
your
nervous
texture
i
succeeded
in
saving
when
i
said
wait
till
philip
mentions
it
without
asking
there
is
the
personal
application
of
my
system
i
have
explained
it
in
my
time
to
every
woman
on
the
list
of
my
acquaintance
including
the
female
servants
not
one
of
them
has
rewarded
me
by
adopting
my
system
how
do
you
feel
about
it
staveley
declined
to
tell
me
whether
she
had
offered
a
bright
example
of
gratitude
to
the
rest
of
the
sex
when
i
asked
why
she
declared
that
it
was
my
turn
now
to
tell
her
what
i
had
been
doing
you
will
anticipate
what
followed
she
objected
to
the
mystery
in
which
my
prospects
seemed
to
be
involved
in
plain
english
was
i
or
was
i
not
engaged
to
marry
her
dear
eunice
i
said
no
what
else
could
i
say
if
i
had
told
staveley
the
truth
when
she
insisted
on
my
explaining
myself
she
would
have
gone
back
to
my
father
and
would
have
appealed
to
his
sense
of
justice
to
forbid
our
marriage
finding
me
obstinately
silent
she
has
decided
on
writing
to
eunice
so
we
parted
but
don
t
be
disheartened
on
my
way
out
of
the
house
i
met
staveley
coming
in
and
had
a
little
talk
with
him
he
and
his
wife
and
his
family
are
going
to
the
seaside
next
week
staveley
once
out
of
our
way
i
can
tell
my
father
of
our
engagement
without
any
fear
of
consequences
if
she
writes
to
him
the
moment
he
sees
my
name
mentioned
and
finds
violent
language
associated
with
it
he
will
hand
the
letter
to
me
your
business
philip
don
t
interrupt
he
will
say
that
and
go
back
to
his
books
there
is
my
father
painted
to
the
life
farewell
for
the
present
remarks
by
philip
s
grace
and
gayety
of
style
might
be
envied
by
any
professional
author
he
amuses
me
but
he
rouses
my
suspicion
at
the
same
time
this
slippery
lover
of
mine
tells
me
to
defer
writing
to
his
father
and
gives
no
reason
for
offering
that
strange
advice
to
the
young
lady
who
is
soon
to
be
a
member
of
the
family
is
this
merely
one
more
instance
of
the
weakness
of
his
character
or
now
that
he
is
away
from
my
influence
is
he
beginning
to
regret
eunice
already
added
by
the
i
too
have
my
doubts
is
the
flippant
nonsense
which
philip
has
written
inspired
by
the
effervescent
good
spirits
of
a
happy
young
man
or
is
it
assumed
for
a
purpose
in
this
latter
case
i
should
gladly
conclude
that
he
was
regarding
his
conduct
to
eunice
with
becoming
emotions
of
sorrow
and
shame
chapter
xliii
the
masterful
masseuse
my
next
quotations
will
suffer
a
process
of
abridgment
i
intend
them
to
present
the
substance
of
three
letters
reduced
as
follows
second
extract
weak
as
he
may
be
philip
dunboyne
shows
in
his
second
letter
that
he
can
feel
resentment
and
that
he
can
express
his
feelings
in
replying
to
miss
helena
he
protests
against
suspicions
which
he
has
not
deserved
that
he
does
sometimes
think
of
eunice
he
sees
no
reason
to
deny
he
is
conscious
of
errors
and
misdeeds
which
traceable
as
they
are
to
helena
s
irresistible
fascinations
may
perhaps
be
considered
rather
his
misfortune
than
his
fault
be
that
as
it
may
he
does
indeed
feel
anxious
to
hear
good
accounts
of
eunice
s
health
if
this
honest
avowal
excites
her
sister
s
jealousy
he
will
be
disappointed
in
helena
for
the
first
time
his
third
letter
shows
that
this
exhibition
of
spirit
has
had
its
effect
the
imperious
young
lady
regrets
that
she
has
hurt
his
feelings
and
is
rewarded
for
the
apology
by
receiving
news
of
the
most
gratifying
kind
faithful
philip
has
told
his
father
that
he
is
engaged
to
be
married
to
miss
helena
gracedieu
daughter
of
the
celebrated
congregational
preacher
and
so
on
and
so
on
has
dunboyne
the
elder
expressed
any
objection
to
the
young
lady
certainly
not
he
knows
nothing
of
the
other
engagement
to
eunice
and
he
merely
objects
on
principle
to
looking
forward
how
do
we
know
says
the
philosopher
what
accidents
may
happen
or
what
doubts
and
hesitations
may
yet
turn
up
i
am
not
to
burden
my
mind
in
this
matter
till
i
know
that
i
must
do
it
let
me
hear
when
she
is
ready
to
go
to
church
and
i
will
be
ready
with
the
settlements
my
compliments
to
miss
and
her
papa
and
let
us
wait
a
dearest
helena
isn
t
he
funny
the
next
letter
has
been
already
mentioned
in
this
there
occurs
the
first
startling
reference
to
tenbruggen
by
name
she
is
in
london
finding
her
way
to
lucrative
celebrity
by
twisting
turning
and
pinching
the
flesh
of
credulous
persons
afflicted
with
nervous
disorders
and
she
has
already
paid
a
few
medical
visits
to
old
dunboyne
he
persists
in
poring
over
his
books
while
tenbruggen
operates
sometimes
on
his
cramped
right
hand
sometimes
in
the
fear
that
his
brain
may
have
something
to
do
with
it
on
the
back
of
his
neck
one
of
them
frowns
over
her
rubbing
and
the
other
frowns
over
his
reading
it
would
be
delightfully
ridiculous
but
for
a
drawback
philip
dunboyne
s
first
impressions
of
tenbruggen
do
not
incline
him
to
look
at
that
lady
from
a
humorous
point
of
view
helena
s
remarks
follow
as
usual
she
has
seen
tenbruggen
s
name
on
the
address
of
a
letter
written
by
miss
jillgall
which
is
quite
enough
to
condemn
tenbruggen
as
for
philip
himself
she
feels
not
quite
sure
of
him
even
yet
no
more
do
i
third
extract
the
letter
that
follows
must
be
permitted
to
speak
for
itself
i
have
flown
into
a
passion
dearest
helena
and
i
am
afraid
i
shall
make
you
fly
into
a
passion
too
blame
tenbruggen
don
t
blame
me
on
the
first
occasion
when
i
found
my
father
under
the
hands
of
the
medical
rubber
she
took
no
notice
of
me
on
the
second
occasion
when
she
had
been
in
daily
attendance
on
him
for
a
week
at
an
exorbitant
fee
she
said
in
the
coolest
manner
who
is
this
young
gentleman
my
father
laid
down
his
book
for
a
moment
only
don
t
interrupt
me
again
ma
am
the
young
gentleman
is
my
son
tenbruggen
eyed
me
with
an
appearance
of
interest
which
i
was
at
a
loss
to
account
for
i
hate
an
impudent
woman
my
visit
came
suddenly
to
an
end
the
next
time
i
saw
my
father
he
was
alone
i
asked
him
how
he
got
on
with
tenbruggen
as
badly
as
possible
it
appeared
she
takes
liberties
with
my
neck
she
interrupts
me
in
my
reading
and
she
does
me
no
good
i
shall
end
philip
in
applying
a
medical
rubbing
to
a
few
days
later
i
found
the
masterful
masseuse
torturing
the
poor
old
gentleman
s
muscles
again
she
had
the
audacity
to
say
to
me
well
philip
when
are
you
going
to
marry
miss
eunice
gracedieu
my
father
looked
up
eunice
he
repeated
when
my
son
told
me
he
was
engaged
to
miss
gracedieu
he
said
helena
philip
what
does
this
mean
tenbruggen
was
so
obliging
as
to
answer
for
me
some
mistake
sir
it
s
eunice
he
is
engaged
i
confess
i
forgot
myself
how
the
devil
do
you
know
that
i
burst
out
tenbruggen
ignored
me
and
my
language
i
am
sorry
to
see
sir
that
your
son
s
education
has
been
neglected
he
seems
to
be
grossly
ignorant
of
the
laws
of
never
mind
the
laws
of
politeness
says
my
father
you
appear
to
be
better
acquainted
with
my
son
s
matrimonial
prospects
than
he
is
himself
how
is
that
tenbruggen
favored
him
with
another
ready
reply
my
authority
is
a
letter
addressed
to
me
by
a
relative
of
gracedieu
my
dear
and
intimate
friend
miss
my
father
s
keen
eyes
traveled
backward
and
forward
between
his
female
surgeon
and
his
son
which
am
i
to
believe
he
inquired
i
am
surprised
at
your
asking
the
question
i
said
tenbruggen
pointed
to
me
look
at
philip
sir
and
you
will
allow
him
one
merit
he
is
capable
of
showing
it
when
he
knows
he
has
disgraced
without
intending
it
i
am
sure
my
father
infuriated
me
he
looked
as
if
he
believed
her
out
came
one
of
the
smallest
and
strongest
words
in
the
english
language
before
i
could
stop
it
mrs
tenbruggen
you
lie
the
illustrious
rubber
dropped
my
father
s
hand
she
had
been
operating
on
him
all
the
time
and
showed
us
that
she
could
assert
her
dignity
when
circumstances
called
for
the
exertion
either
your
son
or
i
sir
must
leave
the
room
which
is
it
to
be
she
met
her
match
in
my
father
walking
quietly
to
the
door
he
opened
it
for
tenbruggen
with
a
low
bow
she
stopped
on
her
way
out
and
delivered
her
parting
words
messieurs
dunboyne
father
and
son
i
keep
my
temper
and
merely
regard
you
as
a
couple
of
with
that
pretty
assertion
of
her
opinion
she
left
us
when
we
were
alone
there
was
but
one
course
to
take
i
made
my
confession
it
is
impossible
to
tell
you
how
my
father
received
it
for
he
sat
down
at
his
library
table
with
his
back
to
me
the
first
thing
he
did
was
to
ask
me
to
help
his
memory
did
you
say
that
the
father
of
these
girls
was
a
parson
yes
a
congregational
what
does
the
minister
think
of
you
i
don
t
know
find
that
was
all
not
another
word
could
i
extract
from
him
i
don
t
pretend
to
have
discovered
what
he
really
has
in
his
mind
i
only
venture
on
a
suggestion
if
there
is
any
old
friend
in
your
town
who
has
some
influence
over
your
father
leave
no
means
untried
of
getting
that
friend
to
say
a
kind
word
for
us
and
then
ask
your
father
to
write
to
mine
this
is
as
i
see
it
our
only
chance
there
the
letter
ends
helena
s
notes
on
it
show
that
her
pride
is
fiercely
interested
in
securing
philip
as
a
husband
her
victory
over
poor
eunice
will
as
she
plainly
intimates
be
only
complete
when
she
is
married
to
young
dunboyne
for
the
rest
her
desperate
resolution
to
win
her
way
to
my
good
graces
is
sufficiently
intelligible
now
my
own
impressions
vary
philip
rather
gains
upon
me
he
appears
to
have
some
capacity
for
feeling
ashamed
of
himself
on
the
other
hand
i
regard
the
discovery
of
an
intimate
friendship
existing
between
tenbruggen
and
miss
jillgall
with
the
gloomiest
views
is
this
formidable
masseuse
likely
to
ply
her
trade
in
the
country
towns
and
is
it
possible
that
she
may
come
to
this
town
god
forbid
of
the
other
letters
in
the
collection
i
need
take
no
special
notice
i
returned
the
whole
correspondence
to
helena
and
waited
to
hear
from
her
the
one
recent
event
in
gracedieu
s
family
worthy
of
record
is
of
a
melancholy
nature
after
paying
his
visit
the
doctor
has
left
word
that
nobody
but
the
nurse
is
to
go
near
the
minister
this
seems
to
indicate
but
too
surely
a
change
for
the
worse
helena
has
been
away
all
the
evening
at
the
girls
school
she
left
a
little
note
informing
me
of
her
wishes
i
shall
expect
to
be
favored
with
your
decision
morning
in
my
housekeeping
at
breakfast
time
the
report
of
the
poor
minister
was
still
discouraging
i
noticed
that
helena
was
absent
from
the
table
miss
jillgall
suspected
that
the
cause
was
bad
news
from
philip
dunboyne
arriving
by
that
morning
s
post
if
you
will
excuse
the
use
of
strong
language
by
a
lady
she
said
helena
looked
perfectly
devilish
when
she
opened
the
letter
she
rushed
away
and
locked
herself
up
in
her
own
shabby
room
a
serious
obstacle
as
i
suspect
in
the
way
of
her
marriage
cheering
isn
t
it
as
usual
good
selina
expressed
her
sentiments
without
reserve
i
had
to
keep
my
appointment
and
the
sooner
helena
gracedieu
and
i
understood
each
other
the
better
i
knocked
at
the
door
it
was
loudly
unlocked
and
violently
thrown
open
helena
s
temper
had
risen
to
boiling
heat
she
stammered
with
rage
when
she
spoke
to
me
i
mean
to
come
to
the
point
at
once
she
said
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
miss
may
i
count
on
your
influence
to
help
me
i
want
a
positive
i
gave
her
what
she
wanted
i
said
certainly
she
took
a
crumpled
letter
from
her
pocket
opened
it
and
smoothed
it
out
on
the
table
with
a
blow
of
her
open
hand
look
at
that
she
said
i
looked
it
was
the
letter
addressed
to
dunboyne
the
elder
which
i
had
written
for
gracedieu
with
the
one
object
of
preventing
helena
s
marriage
of
course
i
can
depend
on
you
to
tell
me
the
truth
she
continued
without
fear
or
favor
i
answered
you
may
depend
on
the
signature
to
the
letter
mr
governor
is
written
by
my
father
but
the
letter
itself
is
in
a
different
hand
do
you
by
any
chance
recognize
the
writing
i
whose
writing
is
it
chapter
xliv
the
resurrection
of
the
past
after
having
identified
my
handwriting
i
waited
with
some
curiosity
to
see
whether
helena
would
let
her
anger
honestly
show
itself
or
whether
she
would
keep
it
down
she
kept
it
down
allow
me
to
return
good
for
the
evil
was
uppermost
nevertheless
when
miss
gracedieu
expressed
herself
in
these
terms
you
are
no
doubt
anxious
to
know
if
philip
s
father
has
been
won
over
to
serve
your
purpose
here
is
philip
s
own
account
of
it
the
last
of
his
letters
that
i
shall
trouble
you
to
i
looked
it
over
the
memorandum
follows
which
i
made
for
my
own
use
an
eccentric
philosopher
is
as
capable
as
the
most
commonplace
human
being
in
existence
of
behaving
like
an
honorable
man
dunboyne
read
the
letter
which
bore
the
minister
s
signature
and
handed
it
to
his
son
can
you
answer
that
was
all
he
said
philip
s
silence
confessed
that
he
was
unable
to
answer
it
and
philip
himself
i
may
add
rose
accordingly
in
my
estimation
his
father
pointed
to
the
i
must
spare
my
cramped
hand
the
philosopher
resumed
and
i
must
answer
gracedieu
s
letter
write
and
leave
a
place
for
my
he
began
to
dictate
his
reply
sir
my
son
philip
has
seen
your
letter
and
has
no
defense
to
make
in
this
respect
he
has
set
an
example
of
candor
which
i
propose
to
follow
there
is
no
excuse
for
him
what
i
can
do
to
show
that
i
feel
for
you
and
agree
with
you
shall
be
done
at
the
age
which
this
young
man
has
reached
the
laws
of
england
abolish
the
authority
of
his
father
if
he
is
sufficiently
infatuated
to
place
his
honor
and
his
happiness
at
the
mercy
of
a
lady
who
has
behaved
to
her
sister
as
your
daughter
has
behaved
to
miss
eunice
i
warn
the
married
couple
not
to
expect
a
farthing
of
my
money
either
during
my
lifetime
or
after
my
death
your
faithful
servant
dunboyne
having
performed
his
duty
as
secretary
philip
received
his
dismissal
you
may
send
my
reply
to
the
post
his
father
said
and
you
may
keep
gracedieu
s
letter
morally
speaking
i
regard
that
last
document
as
a
species
of
mirror
in
which
a
young
gentleman
like
yourself
may
see
how
ugly
he
this
philip
declared
was
his
father
s
form
of
farewell
i
handed
back
the
letter
to
helena
not
a
word
passed
between
us
in
sinister
silence
she
opened
the
door
and
left
me
alone
in
the
room
that
gracedieu
and
i
had
met
in
the
bygone
time
and
this
was
the
only
serious
part
of
it
had
met
in
secret
would
now
be
made
known
to
the
minister
was
i
to
blame
for
having
shrunk
from
distressing
my
good
friend
by
telling
him
that
his
wife
had
privately
consulted
me
on
the
means
of
removing
his
adopted
child
from
his
house
and
even
if
i
had
been
cruel
enough
to
do
this
would
he
have
believed
my
statement
against
the
positive
denial
with
which
the
woman
whom
he
loved
and
trusted
would
have
certainly
met
it
no
let
the
consequences
of
the
coming
disclosure
be
what
they
might
i
failed
to
see
any
valid
reason
for
regretting
my
conduct
in
the
past
time
i
found
miss
jillgall
waiting
in
the
passage
to
see
me
come
out
before
i
could
tell
her
what
had
happened
there
was
a
ring
at
the
the
visitor
proved
to
be
wellwood
the
doctor
i
was
anxious
to
speak
to
him
on
the
subject
of
gracedieu
s
health
miss
jillgall
introduced
me
as
an
old
and
dear
friend
of
the
minister
and
left
us
together
in
the
what
do
i
think
of
gracedieu
he
said
repeating
the
first
question
that
i
put
well
sir
i
think
badly
of
entering
into
details
after
that
ominous
reply
wellwood
did
not
hesitate
to
say
that
his
patient
s
nerves
were
completely
shattered
disease
of
the
brain
had
as
he
feared
been
already
set
up
as
to
the
causes
which
have
produced
this
lamentable
the
doctor
continued
mr
gracedieu
has
been
in
the
habit
of
preaching
extempore
twice
a
day
on
sundays
and
sometimes
in
the
week
as
well
and
has
uniformly
refused
to
spare
himself
when
he
was
in
most
urgent
need
of
rest
if
you
have
ever
attended
his
chapel
you
have
seen
a
man
in
a
state
of
fiery
enthusiasm
feeling
intensely
every
word
that
he
utters
think
of
such
exhaustion
as
that
implies
going
on
for
years
together
and
accumulating
its
wasting
influences
on
a
sensitively
organized
constitution
add
that
he
is
tormented
by
personal
anxieties
which
he
confesses
to
no
one
not
even
to
his
own
children
and
the
sum
of
it
all
is
that
a
worse
case
of
its
kind
i
am
grieved
to
say
has
never
occurred
in
my
before
the
doctor
left
me
to
go
to
his
patient
i
asked
leave
to
occupy
a
minute
more
of
his
time
my
object
was
of
course
to
speak
about
eunice
the
change
of
subject
seemed
to
be
agreeable
to
wellwood
he
smiled
you
need
feel
no
alarm
about
the
health
of
that
interesting
girl
he
said
when
she
complained
to
me
at
her
age
of
not
being
able
to
sleep
i
should
have
taken
it
more
seriously
if
i
had
been
told
that
she
too
had
her
troubles
poor
little
soul
most
likely
but
don
t
forget
that
my
professional
limits
keep
me
in
the
dark
have
you
heard
that
she
took
some
composing
medicine
which
i
had
prescribed
for
her
father
the
effect
certain
in
any
case
to
be
injurious
to
a
young
girl
was
considerably
aggravated
by
the
state
of
her
mind
at
the
time
a
dream
that
frightened
her
and
something
resembling
delirium
seems
to
have
followed
and
she
made
matters
worse
poor
child
by
writing
in
her
diary
about
the
visions
and
supernatural
appearances
that
had
terrified
her
i
was
afraid
of
fever
on
the
day
when
they
first
sent
for
me
we
escaped
that
complication
and
i
was
at
liberty
to
try
the
best
of
all
remedies
quiet
and
change
of
air
i
have
no
fears
for
miss
with
that
cheering
reply
he
went
up
to
the
minister
s
room
all
that
i
had
found
perplexing
in
eunice
was
now
made
clear
i
understood
how
her
agony
at
the
loss
of
her
lover
and
her
keen
sense
of
the
wrong
that
she
had
suffered
had
been
strengthened
in
their
disastrous
influence
by
her
experiment
on
the
sleeping
draught
intended
for
her
father
in
mind
and
body
both
the
poor
girl
was
in
the
condition
which
offered
its
opportunity
to
the
lurking
hereditary
taint
it
was
terrible
to
think
of
what
might
have
happened
if
the
had
not
been
present
to
save
her
before
i
had
been
long
alone
the
came
in
and
said
the
doctor
wanted
to
see
me
wellwood
was
waiting
in
the
passage
outside
the
minister
s
bedchamber
he
asked
if
he
could
speak
to
me
without
interruption
and
without
the
fear
of
being
overheard
i
led
him
at
once
to
the
room
which
i
occupied
as
a
guest
at
the
very
time
when
it
is
most
important
to
keep
gracedieu
quiet
he
said
something
has
happened
to
excite
i
might
almost
say
to
infuriate
him
he
has
left
his
bed
and
is
walking
up
and
down
the
room
and
i
don
t
scruple
to
say
he
is
on
the
verge
of
madness
he
insists
on
seeing
you
being
wholly
unable
to
control
him
in
any
other
way
i
have
consented
to
this
but
i
must
not
allow
you
to
place
yourself
in
what
may
be
a
disagreeable
position
without
a
word
of
warning
judging
by
his
tones
and
his
looks
he
seems
to
have
no
very
friendly
motive
for
wishing
to
see
knowing
perfectly
well
what
had
happened
and
being
one
of
those
impatient
people
who
can
never
endure
suspense
i
offered
to
go
at
once
to
gracedieu
s
room
the
doctor
asked
leave
to
say
one
word
more
pray
be
careful
that
you
neither
say
nor
do
anything
to
thwart
him
wellwood
resumed
if
he
expresses
an
opinion
agree
with
him
if
he
is
insolent
and
overbearing
don
t
answer
him
in
the
state
of
his
brain
the
one
hopeful
course
to
take
is
to
let
him
have
his
own
way
pray
remember
that
i
will
be
within
call
in
case
of
your
wanting
chapter
xlv
the
fatal
portrait
i
knocked
at
the
bedroom
door
who
s
there
only
two
words
but
the
voice
that
uttered
them
hoarse
and
peremptory
was
altered
almost
beyond
recognition
if
i
had
not
known
whose
room
it
was
i
might
have
doubted
whether
the
minister
had
really
spoken
to
me
at
the
instant
when
i
answered
him
i
was
allowed
to
pass
in
having
admitted
me
he
closed
the
door
and
placed
himself
with
his
back
against
it
the
customary
pallor
of
his
face
had
darkened
to
a
deep
red
there
was
an
expression
of
ferocious
mockery
in
his
eyes
helena
s
vengeance
had
hurt
her
unhappy
father
far
more
severely
than
it
seemed
likely
to
hurt
me
the
doctor
had
said
he
was
on
the
verge
of
madness
to
my
thinking
he
had
already
passed
the
boundary
line
he
received
me
with
a
boisterous
affectation
of
cordiality
my
excellent
friend
my
admirable
honorable
welcome
guest
you
don
t
know
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
stand
a
little
nearer
to
the
light
i
want
to
admire
remembering
the
doctor
s
advice
i
obeyed
him
in
silence
ah
you
were
a
handsome
fellow
when
i
first
knew
you
he
said
and
you
have
some
remains
of
it
still
left
do
you
remember
the
time
when
you
were
a
favorite
with
the
ladies
oh
don
t
pretend
to
be
modest
don
t
turn
your
back
now
you
are
old
on
what
you
were
in
the
prime
of
your
life
do
you
own
that
i
am
right
what
his
object
might
be
in
saying
this
if
indeed
he
had
an
object
it
was
impossible
to
guess
the
doctor
s
advice
left
me
no
alternative
i
hastened
to
own
that
he
was
right
as
i
made
that
answer
i
observed
that
he
held
something
in
his
hand
which
was
half
hidden
up
the
sleeve
of
his
what
the
nature
of
the
object
was
i
failed
to
discover
and
when
i
happened
to
speak
of
you
somewhere
he
went
on
i
forget
where
a
member
of
my
congregation
i
don
t
recollect
who
it
was
told
me
you
were
connected
with
the
aristocracy
how
were
you
connected
he
surprised
me
but
however
he
had
got
his
information
he
had
not
been
deceived
i
told
him
that
i
was
connected
through
my
mother
with
the
family
to
which
he
had
alluded
the
aristocracy
he
repeated
a
race
of
people
who
are
rich
without
earning
their
money
and
noble
because
their
were
noble
before
them
they
live
in
idleness
and
luxury
profligates
who
gratify
their
passions
without
shame
and
without
remorse
deny
if
you
dare
that
this
is
a
true
description
of
it
was
really
pitiable
heartily
sorry
for
him
i
pacified
him
again
and
don
t
suppose
i
forget
that
you
are
one
of
them
do
you
hear
me
my
noble
friend
there
was
no
help
for
it
i
made
another
conciliatory
reply
so
far
he
resumed
i
don
t
complain
of
you
you
have
not
attempted
to
deceive
me
yet
absolute
silence
is
what
i
require
next
though
you
may
not
suspect
it
my
mind
is
in
a
ferment
i
must
try
to
to
some
extent
at
least
his
thoughts
betrayed
themselves
in
his
actions
he
put
the
object
that
i
had
half
seen
in
his
hand
into
the
pocket
of
his
and
moved
to
the
opening
one
of
the
drawers
he
took
from
it
a
folded
sheet
of
paper
and
came
back
to
me
a
minister
of
the
gospel
he
said
is
a
sacred
man
and
has
a
horror
of
crime
you
are
safe
so
far
provided
you
obey
me
i
have
a
solemn
and
terrible
duty
to
perform
this
is
not
the
right
place
for
it
follow
me
he
led
the
way
out
the
doctor
waiting
in
the
passage
was
not
near
the
stairs
and
so
escaped
notice
what
is
it
wellwood
whispered
in
the
same
guarded
way
i
said
he
has
not
told
me
yet
i
have
been
careful
not
to
irritate
when
we
descended
the
stairs
the
doctor
followed
us
at
a
safe
distance
he
mended
his
pace
when
the
minister
opened
the
door
of
the
study
and
when
he
saw
us
both
pass
in
before
he
could
follow
the
door
was
closed
and
locked
in
his
face
gracedieu
took
out
the
key
and
threw
it
through
the
open
window
into
the
garden
below
turning
back
into
the
room
he
laid
the
folded
sheet
of
paper
on
the
table
that
done
he
spoke
to
me
i
distrust
my
own
weakness
he
said
a
dreadful
necessity
confronts
me
i
might
shrink
from
the
horrid
idea
and
if
i
could
open
the
door
might
try
to
get
away
escape
is
impossible
now
we
are
prisoners
together
but
don
t
suppose
that
we
are
alone
there
is
a
third
person
present
who
will
judge
between
you
and
me
look
there
he
pointed
solemnly
to
the
portrait
of
his
wife
it
was
a
small
picture
very
simply
framed
representing
the
face
in
a
view
and
part
of
the
figure
only
as
a
work
of
art
it
was
contemptible
but
as
a
likeness
it
answered
its
purpose
my
unhappy
friend
stood
before
it
in
an
attitude
of
dejection
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
in
the
interval
of
silence
that
followed
i
was
reminded
that
an
unseen
friend
was
keeping
watch
outside
alarmed
by
having
heard
the
key
turned
in
the
lock
and
realizing
the
embarrassment
of
the
position
in
which
i
was
placed
the
doctor
had
discovered
a
discreet
way
of
communicating
with
me
he
slipped
one
of
his
under
the
door
with
these
words
written
on
it
how
can
i
help
you
i
took
the
pencil
from
my
pocketbook
and
wrote
on
the
blank
side
of
the
card
he
has
thrown
the
key
into
the
garden
look
for
it
under
the
a
glance
at
the
minister
before
i
returned
my
reply
showed
that
his
attitude
was
unchanged
without
being
seen
or
suspected
i
in
my
turn
slipped
the
card
under
the
door
the
slow
minutes
followed
each
other
and
still
nothing
happened
my
anxiety
to
see
how
the
doctor
s
search
for
the
key
was
succeeding
tempted
me
to
approach
the
window
on
my
way
to
it
the
tail
of
my
coat
threw
down
a
little
tray
containing
pens
and
pencils
which
had
been
left
close
to
the
edge
of
the
table
slight
as
the
noise
of
the
fall
was
it
disturbed
gracedieu
he
looked
round
vacantly
i
have
been
comforted
by
prayer
he
told
me
the
weakness
of
poor
humanity
has
found
strength
in
the
he
pointed
to
the
portrait
once
more
my
hands
must
not
presume
to
touch
it
while
i
am
still
in
doubt
take
it
i
removed
the
picture
and
placed
it
by
his
directions
on
a
chair
that
stood
midway
between
us
to
my
surprise
his
tones
faltered
i
saw
tears
rising
in
his
eyes
you
may
think
you
see
a
picture
there
he
said
you
are
wrong
you
see
my
wife
herself
stand
here
and
look
at
my
wife
with
we
stood
together
with
our
eyes
fixed
on
the
portrait
without
anything
said
or
done
on
my
part
to
irritate
him
he
suddenly
turned
to
me
in
a
state
of
furious
rage
not
a
sign
of
sorrow
he
burst
out
not
a
blush
of
shame
wretch
you
stand
condemned
by
the
atrocious
composure
that
i
see
in
your
face
a
first
discovery
of
the
odious
suspicion
of
which
i
was
the
object
dawned
on
my
mind
at
that
moment
my
capacity
for
restraining
myself
completely
failed
me
i
spoke
to
him
as
if
he
had
been
an
accountable
being
once
for
all
i
said
tell
me
what
i
have
a
right
to
know
you
suspect
me
of
something
what
is
it
instead
of
directly
replying
he
seized
my
arm
and
led
me
to
the
table
take
up
that
paper
he
said
there
is
writing
on
it
read
and
let
her
judge
between
us
your
life
depends
on
how
you
answer
was
there
a
weapon
concealed
in
the
room
or
had
he
got
it
in
the
pocket
of
his
i
listened
for
the
sound
of
the
doctor
s
returning
footsteps
in
the
passage
outside
and
heard
nothing
my
life
had
once
depended
years
since
on
my
success
in
heading
the
arrest
of
an
escaped
prisoner
i
was
not
conscious
then
of
feeling
my
energies
weakened
by
fear
but
man
was
not
mad
and
i
was
younger
in
those
days
by
a
good
twenty
years
or
more
at
my
later
time
of
life
i
could
show
my
old
friend
that
i
was
not
afraid
of
him
but
i
was
conscious
of
an
effort
in
doing
it
i
opened
the
paper
am
i
to
read
this
to
myself
i
asked
or
am
i
to
read
it
aloud
read
it
aloud
in
these
terms
his
daughter
addressed
him
i
have
been
so
unfortunate
dearest
father
as
to
displease
you
and
i
dare
not
hope
that
you
will
consent
to
receive
me
what
it
is
my
painful
duty
to
tell
you
must
be
told
in
writing
grieved
as
i
am
to
distress
you
in
your
present
state
of
health
i
must
not
hesitate
to
reveal
what
it
has
been
my
misfortune
i
may
even
say
my
misery
when
i
think
of
my
mother
to
discover
but
let
me
make
sure
in
such
a
serious
matter
as
this
is
that
i
am
not
mistaken
in
those
happy
past
days
when
i
was
still
dear
to
my
father
you
said
you
thought
of
writing
to
invite
a
friend
to
pay
a
visit
to
this
house
you
had
first
known
him
as
i
understood
when
my
mother
was
still
living
many
interesting
things
you
told
me
about
this
old
friend
but
you
never
mentioned
that
he
knew
or
that
he
had
even
seen
my
mother
i
was
left
to
suppose
that
those
two
had
remained
strangers
to
each
other
to
the
day
of
her
death
if
there
is
any
misinterpretation
here
of
what
you
said
or
perhaps
of
what
you
meant
to
say
pray
destroy
what
i
have
written
without
turning
to
the
next
page
and
forgive
me
for
having
innocently
startled
you
by
a
false
gracedieu
interrupted
me
put
it
down
he
cried
i
won
t
wait
till
you
have
got
to
the
end
i
shall
question
you
now
give
me
the
paper
it
will
help
me
to
keep
this
mystery
of
iniquity
clear
in
my
own
i
gave
him
the
paper
he
hesitated
and
looked
at
the
portrait
once
more
turn
her
away
from
me
he
said
i
can
t
face
my
i
placed
the
picture
with
its
back
to
him
he
consulted
the
paper
reading
it
with
but
little
of
the
confusion
and
hesitation
which
my
experience
of
him
had
induced
me
to
anticipate
had
the
mad
excitement
that
possessed
him
exercised
an
influence
in
clearing
his
mind
resembling
in
some
degree
the
influence
exercised
by
a
storm
in
clearing
the
air
whatever
the
right
explanation
may
be
i
can
only
report
what
i
saw
i
could
hardly
have
mastered
what
his
daughter
had
written
more
readily
if
i
had
been
reading
it
myself
helena
tells
me
he
began
that
you
said
you
knew
her
by
her
likeness
to
her
mother
is
that
true
quite
and
you
made
an
excuse
for
leaving
her
see
here
it
is
written
down
you
made
an
excuse
and
left
her
when
she
asked
for
an
i
he
consulted
the
paper
again
my
daughter
says
no
i
won
t
be
hurried
and
i
won
t
be
interrupted
she
says
you
were
confused
is
that
so
it
is
so
let
your
questions
wait
for
a
moment
i
wish
to
tell
you
why
i
was
haven
t
i
said
i
won
t
be
interrupted
do
you
think
you
can
shake
resolution
he
referred
to
the
paper
again
i
have
lost
the
place
it
s
your
fault
find
it
for
the
evidence
which
was
intended
to
convict
me
was
the
evidence
which
i
was
expected
to
find
i
pointed
it
out
to
him
his
natural
courtesy
asserted
itself
in
spite
of
his
anger
he
said
thank
you
and
questioned
me
the
moment
after
as
fiercely
as
ever
go
back
to
the
time
sir
when
we
met
in
your
rooms
at
the
prison
did
you
know
my
wife
then
certainly
did
you
and
she
see
each
other
ha
i
ve
got
it
now
did
you
see
each
other
after
i
had
left
the
town
no
prevarication
you
own
to
telling
helena
that
you
knew
her
by
her
likeness
to
her
mother
you
must
have
seen
her
mother
where
i
made
another
effort
to
defend
myself
he
again
refused
furiously
to
hear
me
it
was
useless
to
persist
whatever
the
danger
that
threatened
me
might
be
the
sooner
it
showed
itself
the
easier
i
should
feel
i
told
him
that
gracedieu
had
called
on
me
after
he
and
his
wife
had
left
the
town
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
he
cried
that
she
came
to
you
i
after
that
answer
he
no
longer
required
the
paper
to
help
him
he
threw
it
from
him
on
the
floor
and
you
received
her
he
said
without
inquiring
whether
i
knew
of
her
visit
or
not
guilty
deception
on
your
part
guilty
deception
on
her
part
oh
the
hideous
wickedness
of
it
when
his
mad
suspicion
that
i
had
been
his
wife
s
lover
betrayed
itself
in
this
way
i
made
a
last
attempt
in
the
face
of
my
own
conviction
that
it
was
hopeless
to
place
my
conduct
and
his
wife
s
conduct
before
him
in
the
true
light
mrs
gracedieu
s
object
was
to
consult
me
before
i
could
say
the
next
words
i
saw
him
put
his
hand
into
the
pocket
of
his
an
innocent
man
he
sternly
declared
would
have
told
me
that
my
wife
had
been
to
see
him
you
kept
it
a
secret
an
innocent
woman
would
have
given
me
a
reason
for
wishing
to
go
to
you
she
kept
it
a
secret
when
she
left
my
house
she
kept
it
a
secret
when
she
came
mr
gracedieu
i
insist
on
being
heard
your
wife
s
motive
he
drew
from
his
pocket
the
thing
that
he
had
hidden
from
me
this
time
there
was
no
concealment
he
let
me
see
that
he
was
opening
a
razor
it
was
no
time
for
asserting
my
innocence
i
had
to
think
of
preserving
my
life
when
a
man
is
without
firearms
what
defense
can
avail
against
a
razor
in
the
hands
of
a
madman
a
chair
was
at
my
side
it
offered
the
one
poor
means
of
guarding
myself
that
i
could
see
i
laid
my
hand
on
it
and
kept
my
eye
on
him
he
paused
looking
backward
and
forward
between
the
picture
and
me
which
of
them
shall
i
kill
first
he
said
to
himself
the
man
who
was
my
trusted
friend
or
the
woman
whom
i
believed
to
be
an
angel
on
earth
he
stopped
once
more
in
a
state
of
fierce
debating
what
he
should
do
the
woman
he
decided
wretch
fiend
harlot
how
i
loved
her
with
a
yell
of
fury
he
pounced
on
the
picture
ripped
the
canvas
out
of
the
frame
and
cut
it
malignantly
into
fragments
as
they
dropped
from
the
razor
on
the
floor
he
stamped
on
them
and
ground
them
under
his
foot
go
wife
of
my
bosom
he
cried
with
a
dreadful
mockery
of
voice
and
look
go
and
burn
everlastingly
in
the
place
of
torment
his
eyes
glared
at
me
your
turn
now
he
said
and
rushed
at
me
with
his
weapon
ready
in
his
hand
i
hurled
the
chair
at
his
right
arm
the
razor
dropped
on
the
floor
i
caught
him
by
the
wrist
like
a
wild
animal
he
tried
to
bite
me
with
my
free
hand
if
i
had
known
how
to
defend
myself
in
any
other
way
i
would
have
taken
that
way
with
my
free
hand
i
seized
him
by
the
throat
forced
him
back
and
held
him
against
the
wall
my
grasp
on
his
throat
kept
him
quiet
but
the
dread
of
seriously
injuring
him
so
completely
overcame
me
that
i
forgot
i
was
a
prisoner
in
the
room
and
was
on
the
point
of
alarming
the
household
by
a
cry
for
help
i
was
still
struggling
to
preserve
my
when
the
sound
of
footsteps
broke
the
silence
outside
i
heard
the
key
turn
in
the
lock
and
saw
the
doctor
at
the
open
door
chapter
xlvi
the
cumbersome
ladies
i
can
not
prevail
upon
myself
to
dwell
at
any
length
on
the
events
that
followed
we
secured
my
unhappy
friend
and
carried
him
to
his
bed
it
was
necessary
to
have
men
in
attendance
who
could
perform
the
duty
of
watching
him
the
doctor
sent
for
them
while
i
went
downstairs
to
make
the
best
i
could
of
the
miserable
news
which
it
was
impossible
entirely
to
conceal
all
that
i
could
do
to
spare
miss
jillgall
i
did
i
was
obliged
to
acknowledge
that
there
had
been
an
outbreak
of
violence
and
that
the
portrait
of
the
minister
s
wife
had
been
destroyed
by
the
minister
himself
of
helena
s
revenge
on
me
i
said
nothing
it
had
led
to
consequences
which
even
her
merciless
malice
could
not
have
contemplated
there
were
no
obstacles
in
the
way
of
keeping
secret
the
attempt
on
my
life
but
i
was
compelled
to
own
that
gracedieu
had
taken
a
dislike
to
me
which
rendered
it
necessary
that
my
visit
should
be
brought
to
an
end
i
hastened
to
add
that
i
should
go
to
the
hotel
and
should
wait
there
until
the
next
day
in
the
hope
of
hearing
better
news
of
the
multitude
of
questions
with
which
poor
miss
jillgall
overwhelmed
me
of
the
wild
words
of
sorrow
and
alarm
that
escaped
her
of
the
desperate
manner
in
which
she
held
by
my
arm
and
implored
me
not
to
go
away
when
i
must
see
for
myself
that
she
was
a
person
entirely
destitute
of
presence
of
mind
i
shall
say
nothing
the
undeserved
suffering
that
is
inflicted
on
innocent
persons
by
the
sins
of
others
demands
silent
sympathy
and
to
that
extent
at
least
i
can
say
that
i
honestly
felt
for
my
quaint
and
pleasant
little
friend
in
the
evening
the
doctor
called
on
me
at
the
hotel
the
medical
treatment
of
his
patient
had
succeeded
in
calming
the
maddened
brain
under
the
influence
of
sleep
if
the
night
passed
quietly
better
news
might
be
hoped
for
in
the
morning
on
the
next
day
i
had
arranged
to
drive
to
the
farm
being
resolved
not
to
disappoint
eunice
but
i
shrank
from
the
prospect
of
having
to
distress
her
as
i
had
already
distressed
miss
jillgall
the
only
alternative
left
was
to
repeat
the
sad
story
in
writing
subject
to
the
concealments
which
i
had
already
observed
this
i
did
and
sent
the
letter
by
messenger
overnight
so
that
eunice
might
know
when
to
expect
me
the
medical
report
in
the
morning
justified
some
hope
gracedieu
had
slept
well
and
there
had
been
no
reappearance
of
insane
violence
on
his
waking
but
the
doctor
s
opinion
was
far
from
encouraging
when
we
spoke
of
the
future
he
did
not
anticipate
the
cruel
necessity
of
placing
the
minister
under
restraint
unless
some
new
provocation
led
to
a
new
outbreak
the
misfortune
to
be
feared
was
imbecility
i
was
just
leaving
the
hotel
to
keep
my
appointment
with
eunice
when
the
waiter
announced
the
arrival
of
a
young
lady
who
wished
to
speak
with
me
before
i
could
ask
if
she
had
mentioned
her
name
the
young
lady
herself
walked
in
helena
gracedieu
she
explained
her
object
in
calling
on
me
with
the
exasperating
composure
which
was
peculiarly
her
own
no
parallel
to
it
occurs
to
me
in
my
official
experience
of
shameless
women
i
don
t
wish
to
speak
of
what
happened
yesterday
so
far
as
i
know
anything
about
it
she
began
it
is
quite
enough
for
me
that
you
have
been
obliged
to
leave
the
house
and
to
take
refuge
in
this
hotel
i
have
come
to
say
a
word
about
the
future
are
you
honoring
me
with
your
attention
i
signed
to
her
to
go
on
if
i
had
answered
in
words
i
should
have
told
her
to
leave
the
room
at
first
she
resumed
i
thought
of
writing
but
it
occurred
to
me
that
you
might
keep
my
letter
and
show
it
to
philip
by
way
of
lowering
me
in
his
good
opinion
as
you
have
lowered
me
in
the
good
opinion
of
his
father
my
object
in
coming
here
is
to
give
you
a
word
of
warning
if
you
attempt
to
make
mischief
next
between
philip
and
myself
i
shall
hear
of
it
and
you
know
what
to
expect
when
you
have
me
for
an
enemy
it
is
not
worth
while
to
say
any
more
we
understand
each
other
i
hope
she
was
determined
to
have
a
reply
and
she
got
it
not
quite
yet
i
said
i
have
been
hitherto
as
becomes
a
gentleman
always
mindful
of
a
woman
s
claims
to
forbearance
you
will
do
well
not
to
tempt
me
into
forgetting
that
are
a
woman
by
prolonging
your
visit
now
miss
helena
gracedieu
we
understand
each
she
made
me
a
low
curtsey
and
answered
in
her
finest
tone
of
irony
i
only
desire
to
wish
you
a
pleasant
journey
i
rang
for
the
waiter
show
this
lady
out
i
said
even
this
failed
to
have
the
slightest
effect
on
her
she
sauntered
to
the
door
as
perfectly
at
her
ease
as
if
the
room
had
been
hers
not
mine
i
had
thought
of
driving
to
the
farm
shall
i
confess
it
my
temper
was
so
completely
upset
that
active
movement
of
some
kind
offered
the
one
means
of
relief
in
which
i
could
find
refuge
the
farm
was
not
more
than
five
miles
distant
and
i
had
been
a
good
walker
all
my
life
after
making
the
needful
inquiries
i
set
forth
to
visit
eunice
on
foot
my
way
through
the
town
led
me
past
the
minister
s
house
i
had
left
the
door
some
fifty
yards
behind
me
when
i
saw
two
ladies
approaching
they
were
walking
in
the
friendliest
manner
arm
in
arm
as
they
came
nearer
i
discovered
miss
jillgall
her
companion
was
the
lady
who
had
declined
to
give
her
name
when
we
met
accidentally
at
gracedieu
s
door
hysterically
impulsive
miss
jillgall
seized
both
my
hands
and
overwhelmed
me
with
entreaties
that
i
would
go
back
with
her
to
the
house
i
listened
rather
absently
the
lady
happened
to
be
nearer
to
me
now
than
on
either
of
the
former
occasions
on
which
i
had
seen
her
there
was
something
in
the
expression
of
her
eyes
which
seemed
to
be
familiar
to
me
but
the
effort
of
my
memory
was
not
helped
by
what
i
observed
in
the
other
parts
of
her
face
the
hair
the
baggy
lower
eyelids
the
fat
cheeks
the
coarse
complexion
and
the
double
chin
were
features
and
very
disagreeable
features
too
which
i
had
never
seen
at
any
former
time
do
pray
come
back
with
us
miss
jillgall
pleaded
we
were
just
talking
of
you
i
and
my
friend
there
she
stopped
evidently
on
the
point
of
blurting
out
the
name
which
she
had
been
forbidden
to
utter
in
my
hearing
the
lady
smiled
her
provokingly
familiar
eyes
rested
on
me
with
a
humorous
enjoyment
of
the
scene
my
dear
she
said
to
miss
jillgall
caution
ceases
to
be
a
virtue
when
it
ceases
to
be
of
any
use
the
governor
is
beginning
to
remember
me
and
the
inevitable
recognition
with
quickness
of
perception
is
likely
to
be
a
matter
of
minutes
she
turned
to
me
in
more
ways
than
one
sir
women
are
hardly
used
by
nature
as
they
advance
in
years
they
lose
more
in
personal
appearance
than
the
men
do
you
are
and
pray
excuse
me
you
are
too
fat
and
allow
me
to
take
another
liberty
you
stoop
at
the
shoulders
but
you
have
not
entirely
lost
your
good
looks
am
no
longer
recognizable
allow
me
to
prompt
you
as
they
say
on
the
stage
i
am
as
a
man
of
the
world
i
ought
to
have
been
capable
of
concealing
my
astonishment
and
dismay
she
struck
me
dumb
tenbruggen
in
the
town
the
one
woman
whose
appearance
gracedieu
had
dreaded
and
justly
dreaded
stood
before
me
free
as
a
friend
of
his
kinswoman
to
enter
his
house
at
the
very
time
when
he
was
a
helpless
man
guarded
by
watchers
at
his
bedside
my
first
clear
idea
was
to
get
away
from
both
the
women
and
consider
what
was
to
be
done
next
i
bowed
and
begged
to
be
excused
and
said
i
was
in
a
hurry
all
in
a
breath
hearing
this
the
best
of
genial
old
maids
was
unable
to
restrain
her
curiosity
where
are
you
going
she
asked
too
confused
to
think
of
an
excuse
i
said
i
was
going
to
the
farm
to
see
my
dear
euneece
miss
jillgall
burst
out
oh
we
will
go
with
you
tenbruggen
s
politeness
added
immediately
with
the
greatest
chapter
xlvii
the
journey
to
the
farm
my
first
ungrateful
impulse
was
to
get
rid
of
the
two
cumbersome
ladies
who
had
offered
to
be
my
companions
it
was
needless
to
call
upon
my
invention
for
an
excuse
the
truth
as
i
gladly
perceived
would
serve
my
purpose
i
had
only
to
tell
them
that
i
had
arranged
to
walk
to
the
farm
lean
wiry
and
impetuous
miss
jillgall
received
my
excuse
with
the
sincerest
approval
of
it
as
a
new
idea
nothing
could
be
more
agreeable
to
me
she
declared
i
have
been
a
wonderful
walker
all
my
she
turned
to
her
friend
we
will
go
with
him
my
dear
won
t
we
tenbruggen
s
reception
of
this
proposal
inspired
me
with
hope
she
asked
how
far
it
was
to
the
farm
five
miles
she
repeated
and
five
miles
back
again
unless
the
farmer
lends
us
a
cart
my
dear
selina
you
might
as
well
ask
me
to
walk
to
the
north
pole
you
have
got
rid
of
one
of
us
governor
she
added
pleasantly
and
the
other
if
you
only
walk
fast
enough
you
will
leave
behind
you
on
the
road
if
i
believed
in
luck
which
i
don
t
i
should
call
you
a
fortunate
but
companionable
selina
would
not
hear
of
a
separation
she
asked
in
her
most
irresistible
manner
if
i
objected
to
driving
instead
of
walking
her
heart
s
dearest
wish
she
said
was
to
make
her
bosom
friend
and
myself
better
acquainted
with
each
other
to
conclude
she
reminded
me
that
there
was
a
in
the
next
street
perhaps
i
might
have
been
influenced
by
my
distrust
of
tenbruggen
or
perhaps
by
my
anxiety
to
protect
eunice
it
struck
me
that
i
might
warn
the
defenseless
girl
to
be
on
her
guard
with
tenbruggen
to
better
purpose
if
eunice
was
in
a
position
to
recognize
her
in
any
future
emergency
that
might
occur
to
my
mind
this
dangerous
woman
was
doubly
formidable
and
for
a
good
reason
she
was
the
bosom
friend
of
that
innocent
and
unwary
person
miss
jillgall
so
i
amiably
consented
to
forego
my
walk
yielding
to
the
superior
attraction
of
tenbruggen
s
company
on
that
day
the
sunshine
was
tempered
by
a
delightful
breeze
if
we
had
been
in
the
biggest
and
city
on
the
civilised
earth
we
should
have
found
no
public
vehicle
open
to
the
air
which
could
offer
accommodation
to
three
people
being
only
in
a
country
town
we
had
a
light
chaise
at
our
disposal
as
a
matter
of
course
no
wise
man
expects
to
be
mercifully
treated
when
he
is
shut
into
a
carriage
with
a
mature
single
lady
inflamed
by
curiosity
i
was
not
unprepared
for
miss
jillgall
when
she
alluded
for
the
second
time
to
the
sad
events
which
had
happened
in
the
house
on
the
previous
day
and
especially
to
the
destruction
by
gracedieu
of
the
portrait
of
his
wife
why
didn
t
he
destroy
something
else
she
pleaded
piteously
it
is
such
a
disappointment
to
me
i
never
liked
that
picture
myself
of
course
i
ought
to
have
admired
the
portrait
of
the
wife
of
my
benefactor
but
no
that
disagreeable
painted
face
was
too
much
for
me
i
should
have
felt
inexpressibly
relieved
if
i
could
have
shown
it
to
elizabeth
and
heard
her
say
that
she
agreed
with
perhaps
i
saw
it
when
i
called
on
you
tenbruggen
suggested
where
did
the
picture
hang
my
dear
i
received
you
in
the
and
the
portrait
hung
in
gracedieu
s
what
they
said
to
each
other
next
escaped
my
attention
quite
unconsciously
miss
jillgall
had
revealed
to
me
a
danger
which
neither
the
minister
nor
i
had
discovered
though
it
had
conspicuously
threatened
us
both
on
the
wall
of
the
study
the
act
of
mad
destruction
which
if
i
had
possessed
the
means
of
safely
interfering
i
should
certainly
have
endeavored
to
prevent
now
assumed
a
new
and
startling
aspect
if
tenbruggen
really
had
some
motive
of
her
own
for
endeavoring
to
identify
the
adopted
child
the
preservation
of
the
picture
must
have
led
her
straight
to
the
end
in
view
the
most
casual
opportunity
of
comparing
helena
with
the
portrait
of
gracedieu
would
have
revealed
the
likeness
between
mother
and
daughter
and
that
result
attained
the
identification
of
eunice
with
the
infant
whom
the
miss
chance
of
those
days
had
brought
to
the
prison
must
inevitably
have
followed
it
was
perhaps
natural
that
gracedieu
s
infatuated
devotion
to
the
memory
of
his
wife
should
have
blinded
him
to
the
betrayal
of
helena
s
parentage
which
met
his
eyes
every
time
he
entered
his
study
but
that
i
should
have
been
too
stupid
to
discover
what
he
had
failed
to
see
was
a
wound
dealt
to
my
which
i
was
vain
enough
to
feel
acutely
tenbruggen
s
voice
cheery
and
humorous
broke
in
on
my
reflections
with
an
odd
question
mr
governor
do
you
ever
condescend
to
read
novels
it
s
not
easy
to
say
tenbruggen
how
grateful
i
am
to
the
writers
of
ah
i
read
novels
too
but
i
blush
to
confess
do
i
blush
that
i
never
thought
of
feeling
grateful
till
you
mentioned
it
selina
and
i
don
t
complain
of
your
preferring
your
own
reflections
to
our
company
on
the
contrary
you
have
reminded
us
agreeably
of
the
heroes
of
fiction
when
the
author
describes
them
as
being
absorbed
in
for
some
minutes
mr
governor
you
have
been
a
hero
absorbed
as
i
venture
to
guess
in
unpleasant
remembrances
of
the
time
when
i
was
a
single
lady
you
have
not
forgotten
how
badly
i
behaved
and
what
shocking
things
i
said
in
those
bygone
days
am
i
right
you
are
entirely
it
is
possible
that
i
may
have
spoken
a
little
too
sharply
anyway
faithful
selina
interceded
for
her
friend
oh
dear
sir
don
t
be
hard
on
elizabeth
she
always
means
tenbruggen
as
facetious
as
ever
made
a
grateful
return
for
a
small
compliment
she
chucked
miss
jillgall
under
the
chin
with
the
air
of
an
amorous
old
gentleman
expressing
his
approval
of
a
pretty
it
was
impossible
to
look
at
the
two
in
their
relative
situations
without
laughing
but
tenbruggen
failed
to
cheat
me
into
altering
my
opinion
of
her
innocent
miss
jillgall
clapped
her
ugly
hands
and
said
isn
t
she
good
company
tenbruggen
s
social
resources
were
not
exhausted
yet
she
suddenly
shifted
to
the
serious
side
of
her
character
perhaps
i
have
improved
a
little
she
said
as
i
have
advanced
in
years
the
sorrows
of
an
unhappy
married
life
may
have
had
a
purifying
influence
on
my
nature
my
husband
and
i
began
badly
tenbruggen
thought
i
had
money
and
i
thought
tenbruggen
had
money
he
was
taken
in
by
me
and
i
was
taken
in
by
him
when
he
repeated
the
words
of
the
marriage
service
most
impressively
read
by
your
friend
the
chaplain
with
all
my
worldly
goods
i
thee
endow
his
eloquent
voice
suggested
one
of
the
largest
incomes
in
europe
when
i
promised
and
vowed
in
my
turn
the
delightful
prospect
of
squandering
my
rich
husband
s
money
made
quite
a
new
woman
of
me
i
declare
solemnly
when
i
said
i
would
love
honor
and
obey
i
looked
as
if
i
really
meant
it
wherever
he
is
now
poor
dear
he
is
cheating
somebody
such
a
handsome
man
selina
and
oh
mr
governor
such
a
blackguard
having
described
her
husband
in
those
terms
she
got
tired
of
the
subject
we
were
now
favored
with
another
view
of
this
woman
she
appeared
in
her
professional
character
ah
what
a
delicious
breeze
is
blowing
out
here
in
the
country
she
said
will
you
excuse
me
if
i
take
off
my
gloves
i
want
to
air
my
she
held
up
her
hands
to
the
breeze
firm
muscular
deadly
white
hands
in
my
professional
occupation
she
explained
i
am
always
rubbing
tickling
squeezing
tapping
kneading
rolling
striking
the
muscles
of
patients
selina
do
you
know
the
movements
of
your
own
joints
flexion
extension
abduction
adduction
rotation
circumduction
pronation
supination
and
the
lateral
movements
be
proud
of
those
accomplishments
my
dear
but
beware
of
attempting
to
become
a
masseuse
there
are
drawbacks
in
that
vocation
and
i
am
conscious
of
one
of
them
at
this
she
lifted
her
hands
to
her
nose
pah
my
hands
smell
of
other
people
s
flesh
the
delicious
country
air
will
blow
it
away
the
luxury
of
purification
her
fingers
twisted
and
quivered
and
got
crooked
at
one
moment
and
straight
again
at
another
and
showed
themselves
in
succession
singly
and
flew
into
each
other
fiercely
interlaced
and
then
spread
out
again
like
the
sticks
of
a
fan
until
it
really
made
me
giddy
to
look
at
them
as
for
miss
jillgall
she
lifted
her
poor
little
sunken
eyes
rapturously
to
the
sky
as
if
she
called
the
homiest
sunlight
to
witness
that
this
was
the
most
lovable
woman
on
the
face
of
the
earth
but
elderly
female
fascination
offers
its
allurements
in
vain
to
the
rough
animal
man
suspicion
of
tenbruggen
s
motives
had
established
itself
firmly
in
my
mind
why
had
the
popular
masseuse
abandoned
her
brilliant
career
in
london
and
plunged
into
the
obscurity
of
a
country
town
an
opportunity
of
clearing
up
the
doubt
thus
suggested
seemed
to
have
presented
itself
now
is
it
indiscreet
to
ask
i
said
if
you
are
here
in
your
professional
capacity
her
cunning
seized
its
advantage
and
put
a
sly
question
to
me
do
you
wish
to
be
one
of
my
patients
yourself
that
is
unfortunately
impossible
i
replied
i
have
arranged
to
return
to
immediately
at
the
artful
as
she
was
tenbruggen
failed
to
conceal
a
momentary
expression
of
relief
which
betrayed
itself
partly
in
her
manner
partly
in
her
face
she
had
ascertained
to
her
own
complete
satisfaction
that
my
speedy
departure
was
an
event
which
might
be
relied
on
but
i
have
not
yet
answered
you
she
resumed
to
tell
the
truth
i
am
eager
to
try
my
hands
on
you
massage
as
i
practice
it
would
lighten
your
weight
and
restore
your
figure
i
may
even
say
would
lengthen
your
life
you
will
think
of
me
one
of
these
days
won
t
you
in
the
meanwhile
yes
i
am
here
in
my
professional
capacity
several
interesting
cases
and
one
very
remarkable
person
brought
to
death
s
door
by
the
doctors
a
rich
man
who
is
liberal
in
paying
his
fees
there
is
my
quarrel
with
london
and
londoners
some
of
their
papers
medical
newspapers
of
course
declare
that
my
fees
are
exorbitant
and
there
is
a
tendency
among
the
patients
i
mean
the
patients
who
are
rolling
in
riches
to
follow
the
lead
of
the
newspapers
i
am
no
worm
to
be
trodden
on
in
that
way
the
london
people
shall
wait
for
me
until
they
miss
me
and
when
i
do
go
back
they
will
find
the
fees
increased

and
thumbs
mr
governor

not

be
insulted
with
miss
jillgall
nodded
her
head
at
me
it
was
an
eloquent
nod
admire
my
spirited
friend
was
the
interpretation
i
put
on
it
at
the
same
time
my
private
sentiments
suggested
that
tenbruggen
s
reply
was
too
perfectly
satisfactory
viewed
as
an
explanation
my
suspicions
were
by
no
means
set
at
rest
and
i
was
resolved
not
to
let
the
subject
drop
yet
speaking
of
gracedieu
and
of
the
chances
of
his
partial
recovery
i
said
do
you
think
the
minister
would
benefit
by
massage
i
haven
t
a
doubt
of
it
if
you
can
get
rid
of
the
you
think
he
would
be
an
obstacle
in
the
way
there
are
some
medical
men
who
are
honorable
exceptions
to
the
general
rule
and
he
may
be
one
of
them
tenbruggen
admitted
don
t
be
too
hopeful
as
a
doctor
he
belongs
to
the
most
tyrannical
in
existence
may
i
make
a
personal
remark
i
find
something
in
your
manner
pray
don
t
suppose
that
i
am
angry
which
looks
like
distrust
i
mean
distrust
of
miss
jillgall
s
ever
ready
kindness
interfered
in
my
defense
oh
no
elizabeth
you
are
not
often
mistaken
but
indeed
you
are
wrong
now
look
at
my
distinguished
friend
i
remember
my
copy
book
when
i
was
a
small
creature
learning
to
write
in
england
there
were
first
lines
that
we
copied
in
big
letters
and
one
of
them
said
distrust
is
i
know
a
young
person
whose
name
begins
with
h
who
is
one
mass
of
meanness
but
excellent
selina
paused
and
pointed
to
me
with
a
gesture
of
triumph
no
meanness
there
tenbruggen
waited
to
hear
what
i
had
to
say
scornfully
insensible
to
miss
jillgall
s
interruption
you
are
not
altogether
mistaken
i
told
her
i
can
t
say
that
my
mind
is
in
a
state
of
distrust
but
i
own
that
you
puzzle
how
if
you
please
may
i
presume
that
you
remember
the
occasion
when
we
met
at
gracedieu
s
you
saw
that
i
failed
to
recognize
you
and
you
refused
to
give
your
name
when
the
servant
asked
for
it
a
few
days
afterward
i
heard
you
quite
accidentally
forbid
miss
jillgall
to
mention
your
name
in
my
hearing
i
am
at
a
loss
to
understand
before
she
could
answer
me
the
chaise
drew
up
at
the
gate
of
the
farmhouse
tenbruggen
carefully
promised
to
explain
what
had
puzzled
me
at
the
first
opportunity
if
it
escapes
my
memory
she
said
pray
remind
me
of
i
determined
to
remind
her
of
it
whether
i
could
depend
on
her
to
tell
me
the
truth
might
be
quite
another
thing
chapter

the
decision
of
eunice
eunice
ran
out
to
meet
us
and
opened
the
gate
she
was
instantly
folded
in
miss
jillgall
s
arms
on
her
release
she
came
to
me
eager
for
news
of
her
father
s
health
when
i
had
communicated
all
that
i
thought
it
right
to
tell
her
of
the
doctor
s
last
report
she
noticed
tenbruggen
the
appearance
of
a
stranger
seemed
to
embarrass
her
i
left
miss
jillgall
to
introduce
them
to
each
other
darling
euneece
you
remember
tenbruggen
s
name
i
am
sure
elizabeth
this
is
my
sweet
girl
i
mentioned
her
in
my
letters
to
i
hope
she
will
be
sweet
girl
when
we
know
each
other
a
little
better
may
i
kiss
you
dear
you
have
lovely
eyes
but
i
am
sorry
to
see
that
they
don
t
look
like
happy
eyes
you
want
mamma
tenbruggen
to
cheer
you
what
a
charming
old
house
she
put
her
arm
round
eunice
s
waist
and
led
her
to
the
house
door
her
enjoyment
of
the
creepers
that
twined
their
way
up
the
pillars
of
the
porch
was
simply
perfection
as
a
piece
of
acting
when
the
farmer
s
wife
presented
herself
tenbruggen
was
so
irresistibly
amiable
and
took
such
flattering
notice
of
the
children
that
the
harmless
british
matron
actually
blushed
with
pleasure
i
m
sure
ma
am
you
must
have
children
of
your
own
she
said
tenbruggen
cast
her
eyes
on
the
floor
and
sighed
with
pathetic
resignation
a
sweet
little
family
and
all
cruelly
swept
away
by
death
if
the
performance
meant
anything
it
did
most
assuredly
mean
that
what
wonderful
somebody
whispered
in
my
ear
the
children
in
the
room
were
healthy
little
creatures
but
the
name
of
the
innocent
one
among
them
was
selina
before
dinner
we
were
shown
over
the
farm
the
good
woman
of
the
house
led
the
way
and
miss
jillgall
and
i
accompanied
her
the
children
ran
on
in
front
of
us
still
keeping
possession
of
eunice
tenbruggen
followed
at
some
distance
behind
i
looked
back
after
no
very
long
interval
and
saw
that
a
separation
had
taken
place
tenbruggen
passed
me
not
looking
so
pleasantly
as
usual
joined
the
children
and
walked
with
two
of
them
hand
in
hand
a
pattern
of
maternal
amiability
i
dropped
back
a
little
and
gave
eunice
an
opportunity
of
joining
me
having
purposely
left
her
to
form
her
own
opinion
without
any
adverse
influence
exercised
on
my
part
is
that
lady
a
friend
of
yours
she
asked
no
only
an
acquaintance
what
do
you
think
of
her
i
thought
i
should
like
her
at
first
she
was
so
kind
and
seemed
to
take
such
an
interest
in
me
but
she
said
such
strange
things
asked
if
i
was
reckoned
like
my
mother
and
which
of
us
was
the
eldest
my
sister
or
myself
and
whether
we
were
my
father
s
only
two
children
and
if
one
of
us
was
more
his
favorite
than
the
other
what
i
could
tell
her
i
did
tell
but
when
i
said
i
didn
t
know
which
of
us
was
the
oldest
she
gave
me
an
impudent
tap
on
the
cheek
and
said
i
don
t
believe
you
child
and
left
me
how
can
selina
be
so
fond
of
her
don
t
mention
it
to
any
one
else
i
hope
i
shall
never
see
her
i
will
keep
your
secret
eunice
and
you
must
keep
mine
i
entirely
agree
with
you
agree
with
me
in
disliking
her
we
could
say
no
more
at
that
time
our
friends
in
advance
were
waiting
for
us
we
joined
them
at
once
if
i
had
felt
any
doubt
of
the
purpose
which
had
really
induced
tenbruggen
to
leave
london
all
further
uncertainty
on
my
part
was
at
an
end
she
had
some
vile
interest
of
her
own
to
serve
by
identifying
gracedieu
s
adopted
child
but
what
the
nature
of
that
interest
might
be
it
was
impossible
to
guess
the
future
when
i
thought
of
it
now
filled
me
with
dismay
a
more
utterly
helpless
position
than
mine
it
was
not
easy
to
conceive
to
warn
the
minister
in
his
present
critical
state
of
health
was
simply
impossible
my
relations
with
helena
forbade
me
even
to
approach
her
and
as
for
selina
she
was
little
less
than
a
mere
tool
in
the
hands
of
her
friend
what
in
god
s
name
was
i
to
do
at
we
found
the
master
of
the
house
waiting
to
bid
us
welcome
personally
speaking
he
presented
a
remarkable
contrast
to
the
typical
british
farmer
he
was
neither
big
nor
burly
he
spoke
english
as
well
as
i
did
and
there
was
nothing
in
his
dress
which
would
have
made
him
a
fit
subject
for
a
picture
of
rustic
life
when
he
spoke
he
was
able
to
talk
on
subjects
unconnected
with
agricultural
pursuits
nor
did
i
hear
him
grumble
about
the
weather
and
the
crops
it
was
pleasant
to
see
that
his
wife
was
proud
of
him
and
that
he
was
what
all
fathers
ought
to
be
his
children
s
best
and
dearest
friend
why
do
i
dwell
on
these
details
relating
to
a
man
whom
i
was
not
destined
to
see
again
only
because
i
had
reason
to
feel
grateful
to
him
when
my
spirits
were
depressed
by
anxiety
he
made
my
mind
easy
about
eunice
as
long
as
she
remained
in
his
house
the
social
arrangements
when
our
meal
was
over
fell
of
themselves
into
the
right
train
miss
jillgall
went
upstairs
with
the
mother
and
the
children
to
see
the
nursery
and
the
bedrooms
tenbruggen
discovered
a
bond
of
union
between
the
farmer
and
herself
they
were
both
skilled
players
at
backgammon
and
they
sat
down
to
try
conclusions
at
their
favorite
game
without
any
wearisome
necessity
for
excuses
or
stratagems
eunice
took
my
arm
and
led
me
to
the
welcome
retirement
of
her
own
i
could
honestly
congratulate
her
when
i
heard
that
she
was
established
at
the
farm
as
a
member
of
the
family
while
she
was
governess
to
the
children
she
was
safe
from
dangers
that
might
have
threatened
her
if
she
had
been
compelled
by
circumstances
to
return
to
the
minister
s
house
the
entry
in
her
journal
which
she
was
anxious
that
i
should
read
was
placed
before
me
next
i
followed
the
poor
child
s
account
of
the
fearful
night
that
she
had
passed
with
an
interest
that
held
me
breathless
to
the
end
a
terrible
dream
which
had
impressed
a
sense
of
its
reality
on
the
sleeper
by
reaching
its
climax
in
somnambulism
this
was
the
obvious
explanation
no
doubt
and
a
rational
mind
would
not
hesitate
to
accept
it
but
a
rational
mind
is
not
a
universal
gift
even
in
a
country
which
prides
itself
on
the
of
fact
those
good
friends
who
are
always
better
acquainted
with
our
faults
failings
and
weaknesses
than
we
can
pretend
to
be
ourselves
had
long
since
discovered
that
my
nature
was
superstitious
and
my
imagination
likely
to
mislead
me
in
the
presence
of
events
which
encouraged
it
well
i
was
weak
enough
to
recoil
from
the
purely
rational
view
of
all
that
eunice
had
suffered
and
heard
and
seen
on
the
fateful
night
recorded
in
her
journal
good
and
evil
walk
the
ways
of
this
unintelligible
world
on
the
same
free
conditions
if
we
cling
as
many
of
us
do
to
the
comforting
belief
that
departed
spirits
can
minister
to
earthly
creatures
for
good
can
be
felt
moving
in
us
in
a
train
of
thought
and
seen
as
visible
manifestations
in
a
dream
with
what
pretense
of
reason
can
we
deny
that
the
same
freedom
of
supernatural
influence
which
is
conceded
to
the
departed
spirit
working
for
good
is
also
permitted
to
the
departed
spirit
working
for
evil
if
the
grave
can
not
wholly
part
mother
and
child
when
the
mother
s
life
has
been
good
does
eternal
annihilation
separate
them
when
the
mother
s
life
has
been
wicked
no
if
the
departed
spirit
can
bring
with
it
a
blessing
the
departed
spirit
can
bring
with
it
a
curse
i
dared
not
confess
to
eunice
that
the
influence
of
her
might
as
i
thought
possible
have
been
supernaturally
present
when
she
heard
temptation
whispering
in
her
ear
but
i
dared
not
deny
it
to
myself
all
that
i
could
say
to
satisfy
and
sustain
her
i
did
say
and
when
i
declared
with
my
whole
heart
declared
that
the
noble
passion
which
had
elevated
her
whole
being
and
had
triumphed
over
the
sorest
trials
that
desertion
could
inflict
would
still
triumph
to
the
end
i
saw
hope
in
that
brave
and
true
heart
showing
its
bright
promise
for
the
future
in
eunice
s
eyes
she
closed
and
locked
her
journal
by
common
consent
we
sought
the
relief
of
changing
the
subject
eunice
asked
me
if
it
was
really
necessary
that
i
should
return
to
london
i
shrank
from
telling
her
that
i
could
be
of
no
further
use
to
her
father
while
he
regarded
me
with
an
enmity
which
i
had
not
deserved
but
i
saw
no
reason
for
concealing
that
it
was
my
purpose
to
see
philip
dunboyne
you
told
me
yesterday
i
reminded
her
that
i
was
to
say
you
had
forgiven
him
do
you
still
wish
me
to
do
that
indeed
i
do
have
you
thought
of
it
seriously
are
you
sure
of
not
having
been
hurried
by
a
generous
impulse
into
saying
more
than
you
mean
i
have
been
thinking
of
it
she
said
through
the
wakeful
hours
of
last
night
and
many
things
are
plain
to
me
which
i
was
not
sure
of
in
the
time
when
i
was
so
happy
he
has
caused
me
the
bitterest
sorrow
of
my
life
but
he
can
t
undo
the
good
that
i
owe
to
him
he
has
made
a
better
girl
of
me
in
the
time
when
his
love
was
mine
i
don
t
forget
that
miserably
as
it
has
ended
i
don
t
forget
her
voice
trembled
the
tears
rose
in
her
eyes
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
conceal
the
distress
that
i
felt
the
noble
creature
saw
it
no
she
said
faintly
i
am
not
going
to
cry
don
t
look
so
sorry
for
her
hand
pressed
my
hand
gently
pitied
when
i
saw
how
she
struggled
to
control
herself
and
did
control
herself
i
declare
to
god
i
could
have
gone
down
on
my
knees
before
her
she
asked
to
be
allowed
to
speak
of
philip
again
and
for
the
last
time
when
you
meet
with
him
in
london
he
may
perhaps
ask
if
you
have
seen
my
child
he
is
sure
to
break
it
to
him
gently
but
don
t
let
him
deceive
himself
in
this
world
he
must
never
hope
to
see
me
i
tried
very
gently
to
remonstrate
at
your
age
and
at
his
age
i
said
surely
there
is
hope
there
is
no
she
pressed
her
hand
on
her
heart
i
know
it
i
feel
it
oh
eunice
it
s
hard
for
me
to
say
that
i
will
try
to
make
it
easier
for
you
say
that
i
have
forgiven
him
and

and
i
want
to
speak
to
very
unwillingly
but
how
could
i
have
refused
without
giving
offense
i
entered
the
room
when
you
noticed
my
keeping
my
name
from
you
tenbruggen
began
while
selina
was
with
us
you
placed
me
in
an
awkward
position
our
little
friend
is
an
excellent
creature
but
her
tongue
runs
away
with
her
sometimes
i
am
obliged
to
be
careful
of
taking
her
too
readily
into
my
confidence
for
instance
i
have
never
told
her
what
my
name
was
before
i
married
won
t
you
sit
down
i
had
purposely
remained
standing
as
a
hint
to
her
not
to
prolong
the
interview
the
hint
was
thrown
away
i
took
a
chair
selina
s
letters
had
informed
me
she
resumed
that
gracedieu
was
a
nervous
invalid
when
i
came
to
england
i
had
hoped
to
try
what
massage
might
do
to
relieve
him
the
cure
of
their
popular
preacher
might
have
advertised
me
through
the
whole
of
the
congregational
sect
it
was
essential
to
my
success
that
i
should
present
myself
as
a
stranger
i
could
trust
time
and
change
and
my
married
name
certainly
not
known
to
gracedieu
to
keep
up
my
incognito
he
would
have
refused
to
see
me
if
he
had
known
that
i
was
once
miss
i
began
to
be
interested
here
was
an
opportunity
perhaps
of
discovering
what
the
minister
had
failed
to
remember
when
he
had
been
speaking
of
this
woman
and
when
i
had
asked
if
he
had
ever
offended
her
i
was
especially
careful
in
making
my
inquiries
i
remember
how
you
spoke
to
gracedieu
i
said
when
you
and
he
met
long
ago
in
my
rooms
but
surely
you
don
t
think
him
capable
of
vindictively
remembering
some
thoughtless
words
which
escaped
you
sixteen
or
seventeen
years
since
i
am
not
quite
such
a
fool
as
that
mr
governor
what
i
was
thinking
of
was
an
unpleasant
correspondence
between
the
minister
and
myself
before
i
was
so
unfortunate
as
to
meet
with
tenbruggen
i
obtained
a
chance
of
employment
in
a
public
institution
on
condition
that
i
included
a
clergyman
among
my
references
knowing
nobody
else
whom
i
could
apply
to
i
rashly
wrote
to
gracedieu
and
received
one
of
those
cold
and
cruel
refusals
which
only
the
strictest
religious
principle
can
produce
i
was
mortally
offended
at
the
time
and
if
your
friend
the
minister
had
been
within
my
reach
she
paused
and
finished
the
sentence
by
a
significant
gesture
well
i
said
he
is
within
your
reach
and
out
of
his
mind
she
added
besides
one
s
sense
of
injury
doesn
t
last
except
in
novels
and
plays
through
a
series
of
years
i
don
t
pity
him
and
if
an
opportunity
of
shaking
his
high
position
among
his
admiring
congregation
presented
itself
i
daresay
i
might
make
a
mischievous
return
for
his
letter
to
me
in
the
meanwhile
we
may
drop
the
subject
i
suppose
you
understand
now
why
i
concealed
my
name
from
you
and
why
i
kept
out
of
the
house
while
you
were
in
it
was
plain
enough
of
course
if
i
had
known
her
again
or
had
heard
her
name
i
might
have
told
the
minister
that
tenbruggen
and
miss
chance
were
one
and
the
same
and
if
i
had
seen
her
and
talked
with
her
in
the
house
my
memory
might
have
shown
itself
capable
of
improvement
having
politely
presented
the
expression
of
my
thanks
i
rose
to
go
she
stopped
me
at
the
door
one
word
more
she
said
while
selina
is
out
of
the
way
i
need
hardly
tell
you
that
i
have
not
trusted
her
with
the
minister
s
secret
you
and
i
are
as
i
take
it
the
only
people
now
living
who
know
the
truth
about
these
two
girls
and
we
keep
our
what
advantage
i
asked
don
t
you
know
i
don
t
no
more
do
i
female
folly
and
a
slip
of
the
tongue
i
am
old
and
ugly
but
i
am
still
a
woman
about
miss
eunice
somebody
has
told
the
pretty
little
fool
never
to
trust
strangers
you
would
have
been
amused
if
you
had
heard
that
sly
young
person
prevaricating
with
me
in
one
respect
her
appearance
strikes
me
she
is
not
like
either
the
wretch
who
was
hanged
or
the
poor
victim
who
was
murdered
can
she
be
the
adopted
child
or
is
it
the
other
sister
whom
i
have
not
seen
yet
oh
come
come
don
t
try
to
look
as
if
you
didn
t
know
that
is
really
too
you
alluded
just
now
i
answered
to
our
advantage
in
being
the
only
persons
who
know
the
truth
about
the
two
girls
well
tenbruggen
i
keep
in
other
words
she
rejoined
you
leave
me
to
make
the
discovery
myself
well
my
friend
i
mean
to
do
it
in
the
evening
my
hotel
offered
to
me
the
refuge
of
which
i
stood
in
need
i
could
think
for
the
first
time
that
day
without
interruption
being
resolved
to
see
philip
i
prepared
myself
for
the
interview
by
consulting
my
extracts
once
more
the
letter
in
which
tenbruggen
figures
inspired
me
with
the
hope
of
protection
for
gracedieu
attainable
through
no
less
a
person
than
helena
herself
to
begin
with
she
would
certainly
share
philip
s
aversion
to
the
masseuse
and
her
dislike
of
miss
jillgall
would
just
as
possibly
extend
to
miss
jillgall
s
friend
the
hostile
feeling
thus
set
up
might
be
trusted
to
keep
watch
on
tenbruggen
s
proceedings
with
a
vigilance
not
attainable
by
the
coarser
observation
of
a
man
in
the
event
of
an
improvement
in
the
minister
s
health
i
should
hear
of
it
both
from
the
doctor
and
from
miss
jillgall
and
in
that
case
i
should
instantly
return
to
my
unhappy
friend
and
put
him
on
his
guard
i
started
for
london
by
the
early
train
in
the
morning
my
way
home
from
the
terminus
took
me
past
the
hotel
at
which
the
elder
dunboyne
was
staying
i
called
on
him
he
was
reported
to
be
engaged
that
is
to
say
immersed
in
his
books
the
address
on
one
of
philip
s
letters
had
informed
me
that
he
was
staying
at
another
hotel
pursuing
my
inquiries
in
this
direction
i
met
with
a
severe
disappointment
philip
dunboyne
had
left
the
hotel
that
morning
for
what
destination
neither
the
landlord
nor
the
waiter
could
tell
me
the
next
day
s
post
brought
with
it
the
information
which
i
had
failed
to
obtain
miss
jillgall
wrote
informing
me
in
her
strongest
language
that
philip
dunboyne
had
returned
to
helena
indignant
selina
added
helena
means
to
make
him
marry
her
and
i
promise
you
she
shall
fail
if
i
can
stop
in
taking
leave
of
eunice
i
had
given
her
my
address
had
warned
her
to
be
careful
if
she
and
tenbruggen
happened
to
meet
again
and
had
begged
her
to
write
to
me
or
to
come
to
me
if
anything
happened
to
alarm
her
in
my
absence
in
two
days
more
i
received
a
line
from
eunice
written
evidently
in
the
greatest
agitation
philip
has
discovered
me
he
has
been
here
and
has
insisted
on
seeing
me
i
have
refused
the
good
farmer
has
so
kindly
taken
my
part
i
can
write
no
chapter
the
news
from
the
farm
when
i
next
heard
from
miss
jillgall
the
introductory
part
of
her
letter
merely
reminded
me
that
philip
dunboyne
was
established
in
the
town
and
that
helena
was
in
daily
communication
with
him
i
shall
do
selina
no
injustice
if
my
extract
begins
with
her
second
page
you
will
sympathize
i
am
sure
she
writes
with
the
indignation
which
urged
me
to
call
on
philip
and
tell
him
the
way
to
the
farmhouse
think
of
helena
being
determined
to
marry
him
whether
he
wants
to
or
not
i
am
afraid
this
is
bad
grammar
but
there
are
occasions
when
even
a
cultivated
lady
fails
in
her
grammar
and
almost
envies
the
men
their
privilege
of
swearing
when
they
are
in
a
rage
my
state
of
mind
is
truly
indescribable
grief
mingles
with
anger
when
i
tell
you
that
my
sweet
euneece
has
disappointed
me
for
the
first
time
since
i
had
the
happiness
of
knowing
and
admiring
her
what
can
have
been
the
motive
of
her
refusal
to
receive
her
penitent
lover
is
it
pride
we
are
told
that
satan
fell
through
pride
euneece
satanic
impossible
i
feel
inclined
to
go
and
ask
her
what
has
hardened
her
heart
against
a
poor
young
man
who
bitterly
regrets
his
own
folly
do
you
think
it
was
bad
advice
from
the
farmer
or
his
wife
in
that
case
i
shall
exert
my
influence
and
take
her
away
you
would
do
the
same
wouldn
t
you
i
am
ashamed
to
mention
the
poor
dear
minister
in
a
postscript
the
truth
is
i
don
t
very
well
know
what
i
am
about
gracedieu
is
quiet
sleeps
better
than
he
did
eats
with
a
keener
appetite
gives
no
trouble
but
alas
that
glorious
intellect
is
in
a
state
of
eclipse
do
not
suppose
because
i
write
figuratively
that
i
am
not
sorry
for
him
he
understands
nothing
he
remembers
nothing
he
has
my
prayers
you
might
come
to
us
again
if
you
would
only
be
so
kind
it
would
make
no
difference
now
the
poor
man
is
so
sadly
altered
i
must
add
most
reluctantly
that
the
doctor
recommends
your
staying
at
home
between
ourselves
he
is
little
better
than
a
coward
fancy
his
saying
no
we
must
not
run
that
risk
i
am
barely
civil
to
him
and
no
more
in
any
other
affair
excuse
me
for
troubling
you
with
a
second
postscript
my
sympathy
with
euneece
would
have
penetrated
her
motives
i
should
have
felt
with
her
feelings
but
i
have
never
been
in
love
no
gentleman
gave
me
the
opportunity
when
i
was
young
now
i
am
neglect
has
done
its
dreary
work
my
heart
is
an
extinct
crater
figurative
again
i
had
better
put
my
pen
away
and
say
farewell
for
the
miss
jillgall
may
now
give
place
to
eunice
the
same
day
s
post
brought
me
both
letters
i
should
be
unworthy
indeed
of
the
trust
which
this
affectionate
girl
has
placed
in
me
if
i
failed
to
receive
her
explanation
of
her
conduct
toward
philip
dunboyne
as
a
sacred
secret
confided
to
my
fatherly
regard
in
those
later
portions
of
her
letter
which
are
not
addressed
to
me
confidentially
eunice
writes
as
follows
i
get
news
and
what
heartbreaking
news
of
my
father
by
sending
a
messenger
to
selina
it
is
more
than
ever
impossible
that
i
can
put
myself
in
the
way
of
seeing
helena
again
she
has
written
to
me
about
philip
in
a
tone
so
shockingly
insolent
and
cruel
that
i
have
destroyed
her
letter
philip
s
visit
to
the
farm
discovered
i
don
t
know
how
seems
to
have
infuriated
her
she
accuses
me
of
doing
all
that
she
might
herself
have
done
in
my
place
and
threatens
me
no
i
am
afraid
of
the
wicked
whisperings
of
that
second
self
of
mine
if
i
think
of
it
they
were
near
to
tempting
me
when
i
read
helena
s
letter
but
i
thought
of
what
you
said
after
i
had
shown
you
my
journal
and
your
words
took
my
memory
back
to
the
days
when
i
was
happy
with
philip
the
trial
and
the
terror
passed
away
consolation
has
come
to
me
from
the
best
of
good
women
staveley
writes
as
lovingly
as
my
mother
might
have
written
if
death
had
spared
her
i
have
replied
with
all
the
gratitude
that
i
really
feel
but
without
taking
advantage
of
the
services
which
she
offers
staveley
has
it
in
her
mind
as
you
had
it
in
your
mind
to
bring
philip
back
to
me
does
she
forget
do
you
forget
that
helena
claims
him
but
you
both
mean
kindly
and
i
love
you
both
for
the
interest
that
you
feel
in
me
the
farmer
s
wife
dear
good
soul
hardly
understands
me
so
well
as
her
husband
does
she
confesses
to
pitying
philip
he
is
so
wretched
she
says
and
dear
heart
how
handsome
and
what
nice
winning
manners
i
don
t
think
i
should
have
had
your
courage
in
your
place
to
tell
the
truth
i
should
have
jumped
for
joy
when
i
saw
him
at
the
door
and
i
should
have
run
down
to
let
him
in
and
perhaps
been
sorry
for
it
afterward
if
you
really
wish
to
forget
him
my
dear
i
will
do
all
i
can
to
help
these
are
trifling
things
to
mention
but
i
am
afraid
you
may
think
i
am
unhappy
and
i
want
to
prevent
that
i
have
so
much
to
be
thankful
for
and
the
children
are
so
fond
of
me
whether
i
teach
them
as
well
as
i
might
have
done
if
i
had
been
a
more
learned
girl
may
perhaps
be
doubtful
they
do
more
for
their
governess
i
am
afraid
than
their
governess
does
for
them
when
they
come
into
my
room
in
the
morning
and
rouse
me
with
their
kisses
the
hour
of
waking
which
used
to
be
so
hard
to
endure
after
philip
left
me
is
now
the
happiest
hour
of
my
with
that
reassuring
view
of
her
life
as
a
governess
the
poor
child
s
letter
comes
to
an
end
chapter
li
the
triumph
of
tenbruggen
miss
jillgall
appears
again
after
an
interval
on
the
field
of
my
extracts
my
pleasant
friend
deserves
this
time
a
serious
reception
she
informs
me
that
tenbruggen
has
begun
the
inquiries
which
i
have
the
best
reason
to
dread
for
i
alone
know
the
end
which
they
are
designed
to
reach
the
arrival
of
this
news
affected
me
in
two
different
ways
it
was
discouraging
to
find
that
circumstances
had
not
justified
my
reliance
on
helena
s
enmity
as
a
to
tenbruggen
on
the
other
hand
it
was
a
relief
to
be
assured
that
my
return
to
london
would
serve
rather
than
compromise
the
interests
which
it
was
my
chief
anxiety
to
defend
i
had
foreseen
that
tenbruggen
would
wait
to
set
her
enterprise
on
foot
until
i
was
out
of
her
way
and
i
had
calculated
on
my
absence
as
an
event
which
would
at
least
put
an
end
to
suspense
by
encouraging
her
to
begin
the
first
sentences
in
miss
jillgall
s
letter
explain
the
nature
of
her
interest
in
the
proceedings
of
her
friend
and
are
on
that
account
worth
reading
things
are
sadly
changed
for
the
worse
selina
writes
but
i
don
t
forget
that
philip
was
once
engaged
to
euneece
and
that
gracedieu
s
extraordinary
conduct
toward
him
puzzled
us
all
the
mode
of
discovery
which
dear
elizabeth
suggested
by
letter
at
that
time
appears
to
be
the
mode
which
she
is
following
now
when
i
asked
why
she
said
philip
may
return
to
euneece
the
minister
may
recover
and
will
be
all
the
more
likely
to
do
so
if
he
tries
massage
in
that
case
he
will
probably
repeat
the
conduct
which
surprised
you
and
your
natural
curiosity
will
ask
me
again
to
find
out
what
it
means
am
i
your
friend
selina
or
am
i
not
this
was
so
delightfully
kind
and
so
irresistibly
conclusive
that
i
kissed
her
in
a
transport
of
gratitude
with
what
breathless
interest
i
have
watched
her
progress
toward
penetrating
the
mystery
of
the
girls
ages
it
is
quite
needless
to
tell
tenbruggen
s
method
of
keeping
miss
jillgall
in
ignorance
of
what
she
was
really
about
and
miss
jillgall
s
admirable
confidence
in
the
integrity
of
tenbruggen
being
now
set
forth
on
the
best
authority
an
exact
presentation
of
the
state
of
affairs
will
be
completed
if
i
add
a
word
more
relating
to
the
positions
actually
occupied
toward
tenbruggen
s
enterprise
by
my
correspondent
and
myself
on
her
side
miss
jillgall
was
entirely
ignorant
that
one
of
the
two
girls
was
not
gracedieu
s
daughter
but
his
adopted
child
on
my
side
i
was
entirely
ignorant
of
tenbruggen
s
purpose
in
endeavoring
to
identify
the
daughter
of
the
murderess
speaking
of
myself
individually
let
me
add
that
i
only
waited
the
event
to
protect
the
helpless
ones
my
poor
demented
friend
and
the
orphan
whom
his
mercy
received
into
his
heart
and
his
home
miss
jillgall
goes
on
with
her
curious
story
as
follows
always
desirous
of
making
myself
useful
i
thought
i
would
give
my
dear
elizabeth
a
hint
which
might
save
time
and
trouble
why
not
begin
i
suggested
by
asking
the
governor
to
help
you
that
wonderful
woman
never
forgets
anything
she
had
already
applied
to
you
without
success
in
my
next
attempt
to
be
useful
i
did
violence
to
my
most
cherished
convictions
by
presenting
the
wretch
helena
to
the
admirable
elizabeth
that
the
former
would
be
cold
as
ice
in
her
reception
of
any
friend
of
mine
was
nothing
wonderful
tenbruggen
passed
it
over
with
the
graceful
composure
of
a
woman
of
the
world
in
the
course
of
conversation
with
helena
she
slipped
in
a
question
might
i
ask
if
you
are
older
than
your
sister
the
answer
was
of
course
i
don
t
and
here
for
once
the
most
deceitful
girl
in
existence
spoke
the
truth
when
we
were
alone
again
elizabeth
made
a
remark
if
personal
appearance
could
decide
the
question
she
said
the
disagreeable
young
woman
is
the
oldest
of
the
two
the
next
thing
to
be
done
is
to
discover
if
looks
are
to
be
trusted
in
this
my
friend
s
lawyer
received
confidential
instructions
not
shown
to
me
which
seems
rather
hard
to
trace
the
two
miss
gracedieus
registers
of
birth
elizabeth
described
this
proceeding
not
very
intelligibly
to
my
mind
as
a
means
of
finding
out
which
of
the
girls
could
be
identified
by
name
as
the
elder
of
the
two
the
report
arrived
this
morning
i
was
only
informed
that
the
result
in
one
case
had
entirely
defeated
the
inquiries
in
the
other
case
elizabeth
had
helped
her
agent
by
referring
him
to
a
birth
advertised
in
the
customary
columns
of
the
newspaper
even
here
there
was
a
fatal
obstacle
the
name
of
the
place
in
which
gracedieu
s
daughter
had
been
born
was
not
added
as
usual
i
still
tried
to
be
useful
had
my
friend
known
the
minister
s
wife
my
friend
had
never
even
seen
the
minister
s
wife
and
as
if
by
a
fatality
her
portrait
was
no
longer
in
existence
i
could
only
mention
that
helena
was
like
her
mother
but
elizabeth
seemed
to
attach
very
little
importance
to
my
evidence
if
i
may
call
it
by
so
grand
a
name
people
have
such
strange
ideas
about
likenesses
she
said
and
arrive
at
such
contradictory
conclusions
one
can
only
trust
one
s
own
eyes
in
a
matter
of
that
my
friend
next
asked
me
about
our
domestic
establishment
we
had
only
a
cook
and
a
housemaid
if
they
were
old
servants
who
had
known
the
girls
as
children
they
might
be
made
of
some
use
our
luck
was
as
steadily
against
us
as
ever
they
had
both
been
engaged
when
gracedieu
assumed
his
new
pastoral
duties
after
having
resided
with
his
wife
at
her
native
place
i
asked
elizabeth
what
she
proposed
to
do
next
she
deferred
her
answer
until
i
had
first
told
her
whether
the
visit
of
the
doctor
might
be
expected
on
that
day
i
could
reply
to
this
in
the
negative
elizabeth
thereupon
made
a
startling
request
she
begged
me
to
introduce
her
to
gracedieu
i
said
surely
you
have
forgotten
the
sad
state
of
his
mind
no
she
knew
perfectly
well
that
he
was
imbecile
i
want
to
try
she
explained
if
i
can
rouse
him
for
a
few
by
massage
i
inquired
she
burst
out
laughing
massage
my
dear
doesn
t
act
in
that
way
it
is
an
elaborate
process
pursued
patiently
for
weeks
together
but
my
hands
have
more
than
one
accomplishment
at
their
oh
make
your
mind
easy
i
shall
do
no
harm
if
i
do
no
good
take
me
selina
to
the
we
went
to
his
room
don
t
blame
me
for
giving
way
i
am
too
fond
of
elizabeth
to
be
able
to
disappoint
her
it
was
a
sad
sight
when
we
went
in
he
was
quite
happy
playing
like
a
child
at
the
attendant
retired
at
my
request
i
introduced
tenbruggen
he
smiled
and
shook
hands
with
her
he
said
are
you
a
christian
or
a
pagan
you
are
very
pretty
how
many
times
can
you
catch
the
ball
in
the
cup
the
effort
to
talk
to
her
ended
there
he
went
on
with
his
game
and
seemed
to
forget
that
there
was
anybody
in
the
room
it
made
my
heart
ache
to
remember
what
he
was
and
to
see
him
now
elizabeth
whispered
leave
me
alone
with
i
don
t
know
why
i
did
such
a
rude
thing
i
hesitated
elizabeth
asked
me
if
i
had
no
confidence
in
her
i
was
ashamed
of
myself
i
left
them
together
a
long
passed
feeling
a
little
uneasy
i
went
upstairs
again
and
looked
into
the
room
he
was
leaning
back
in
his
chair
his
plaything
was
on
the
floor
and
he
was
looking
vacantly
at
the
light
that
came
in
through
the
window
i
found
tenbruggen
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
in
the
act
of
ringing
the
bell
nothing
in
the
least
out
of
the
ordinary
way
seemed
to
have
happened
when
the
attendant
had
answered
the
bell
we
left
the
room
together
gracedieu
took
no
notice
of
us
well
i
said
how
has
it
ended
quite
calmly
my
noble
elizabeth
answered
in
total
what
did
you
say
to
him
after
you
sent
me
away
i
tried
in
every
possible
way
to
get
him
to
tell
me
which
of
his
two
daughters
was
the
did
he
refuse
to
answer
he
was
only
too
ready
to
answer
first
he
said
helena
was
the
oldest
then
he
corrected
himself
and
declared
that
eunice
was
the
oldest
then
he
said
they
were
twins
then
he
went
back
to
helena
and
eunice
now
one
was
the
oldest
and
now
the
other
he
rang
the
changes
on
those
two
names
i
can
t
tell
you
how
often
and
seemed
to
think
it
a
better
game
than
what
is
to
be
done
nothing
is
to
be
done
what
i
cried
you
give
it
up
my
heroic
friend
answered
i
know
when
i
am
beaten
my
dear
i
give
it
she
looked
at
her
watch
it
was
time
to
operate
on
the
muscles
of
one
of
her
patients
away
she
went
on
her
glorious
mission
of
massage
without
a
murmur
of
regret
what
strength
of
mind
but
oh
dear
what
a
disappointment
for
poor
little
me
on
one
thing
i
am
determined
if
i
find
myself
getting
puzzled
or
frightened
i
shall
instantly
write
to
with
that
expression
of
confidence
in
me
selina
s
narrative
came
to
an
end
i
wish
i
could
have
believed
as
she
did
that
the
object
of
her
admiration
had
been
telling
her
the
truth
a
few
days
later
tenbruggen
honored
me
with
a
visit
at
my
house
in
the
neighborhood
of
london
thanks
to
this
circumstance
i
am
able
to
add
a
postscript
which
will
complete
the
revelations
in
miss
jillgall
s
letter
the
illustrious
masseuse
having
much
to
conceal
from
her
faithful
selina
was
well
aware
that
she
had
only
one
thing
to
keep
hidden
from
me
namely
the
advantage
which
she
would
have
gained
if
her
inquiries
had
met
with
success
i
thought
i
might
have
got
at
what
i
wanted
she
told
me
by
mesmerizing
our
reverend
friend
he
is
as
weak
as
a
woman
i
threw
him
into
hysterics
and
had
to
give
it
up
and
quiet
him
or
he
would
have
alarmed
the
house
you
look
as
if
you
don
t
believe
in
my
looks
tenbruggen
exactly
express
my
opinion
mesmerism
is
a
humbug
you
amusing
old
tory
shall
i
throw
you
into
a
state
of
trance
no
i
ll
give
you
a
shock
of
another
kind
a
shock
of
surprise
i
know
as
much
as
you
do
about
gracedieu
s
daughters
what
do
you
think
of
that
i
think
i
should
like
to
hear
you
tell
me
which
is
the
adopted
helena
to
be
sure
her
manner
was
defiant
her
tone
was
positive
i
doubted
both
under
the
surface
of
her
assumed
confidence
i
saw
something
which
told
me
that
she
was
trying
to
read
my
thoughts
in
my
face
many
other
women
had
tried
to
do
that
they
succeeded
when
i
was
young
when
i
had
reached
the
wrong
side
of
fifty
my
face
had
learned
discretion
and
they
failed
how
did
you
arrive
at
your
discovery
i
asked
i
know
of
nobody
who
could
have
helped
i
helped
myself
sir
i
reasoned
it
out
a
wonderful
thing
for
a
woman
to
do
isn
t
it
i
wonder
whether
you
could
follow
the
process
my
reply
to
this
was
made
by
a
bow
i
was
sure
of
my
command
over
my
face
but
perfect
control
of
the
voice
is
a
rare
power
here
and
there
a
great
actor
or
a
great
criminal
possesses
it
tenbruggen
s
vanity
took
me
into
her
confidence
in
the
first
place
she
said
helena
is
plainly
the
wicked
one
of
the
two
i
was
not
prejudiced
by
what
selina
had
told
me
of
her
i
saw
it
and
felt
it
before
i
had
been
five
minutes
in
her
company
if
lying
tongues
ever
provoke
her
as
lying
tongues
provoked
her
mother
she
will
follow
her
mother
s
example
very
well
now
in
the
second
place
though
it
is
very
slight
there
is
a
certain
something
in
her
hair
and
her
complexion
which
reminds
me
of
the
murderess
there
is
no
other
resemblance
i
admit
in
the
third
place
the
girls
names
point
to
the
same
conclusion
gracedieu
is
a
protestant
and
a
dissenter
would
he
call
a
child
of
his
own
by
the
name
of
a
roman
catholic
saint
no
he
would
prefer
a
name
in
the
bible
eunice
is
child
and
helena
was
once
the
baby
whom
i
carried
into
the
prison
do
you
deny
that
i
don
t
deny
only
four
words
but
they
were
deceitfully
spoken
and
the
deceit
practiced
in
eunice
s
interest
it
is
needless
to
say
succeeded
tenbruggen
s
object
in
visiting
me
was
attained
i
had
confirmed
her
belief
in
the
delusion
that
helena
was
the
adopted
child
she
got
up
to
take
her
leave
i
asked
if
she
proposed
remaining
in
london
no
she
was
returning
to
her
country
patients
that
night
as
i
attended
her
to
the
she
turned
to
me
with
her
mischievous
smile
i
have
taken
some
trouble
in
finding
the
clew
to
the
minister
s
mystery
she
said
don
t
you
wonder
why
if
i
did
wonder
i
answered
would
you
tell
me
why
she
laughed
at
the
bare
idea
of
it
another
lesson
she
said
to
assist
a
helpless
man
in
studying
the
weaker
sex
i
have
already
shown
you
that
a
woman
can
reason
learn
next
that
a
woman
can
keep
a
secret

bless
you
of
the
events

followed

is
not

for
me
i
am
thankful
to
say
to
speak
from
personal
experience
ought
i
to
conclude
with
an
expression
of
repentance
for
the
act
of
deception
to
which
i
have
already
pleaded
guilty
i
don
t
know

the
force
of
circumstances
does
really
compel

to

has
no

for
relief
perhaps
and
waiting

listened

my

do
you
know
how
i
might
answer
you
if
i
was
an
woman
i
have
no
curiosity
to
hear
it
i
might
ask
you
she
persisted
to
allow
me
to

i
am
incapable
of
making
an
ungrateful
return
for
the

which
you
take

me
venture
to
ask
if

of

you
going

time
dear
miss
gracedieu
has
always
been
a
good
friend
of
mine
because
i
know
how
to
make
the
best
use
of

of

famous

more
i

to

let
me

this

your

by
some

burst
out
laughing
with
the
air
of
a
woman
who
thoroughly
enjoyed
a
good
joke
i
looked
back
when
i
left
the
room
and
saw
the
friend
of
father
time
in
the
easy
chair
opening
our
newspaper
this
is
a
specimen
of
the
customary
encounter
of
our
wits
i
place
it
on
record
in
my
journal
to
excuse
myself
myself
when
she
left
us
at
last
later
in
the
day
i
sent
a
letter
after
her
to
the
hotel
not
having
kept
a
copy
of
it
let
me
present
the
substance
like
a
sermon
under
three
heads
i
begged
to
be
excused
for
speaking
plainly
i
declared
that
there
was
a
total
want
of
sympathy
between
us
on
my
side
and
i
proposed
that
she
should
deprive
me
of
future
opportunities
of
receiving
her
in
this
house
the
reply
arrived
immediately
in
these
terms
your
letter
received
dear
girl
i
am
not
in
the
least
angry
partly
because
i
am
very
fond
of
you
partly
because
i
know
that
you
will
ask
me
to
come
back
again
philip
sends
his
this
last
piece
of
insolence
was
unquestionably
a
lie
philip
detests
her
they
are
both
staying
at
the
same
hotel
but
i
happen
to
know
that
he
won
t
even
look
at
her
if
they
meet
by
accident
on
the
stairs
people
who
can
enjoy
the
melancholy
spectacle
of
human
nature
in
a
state
of
degradation
would
be
at
a
loss
which
exhibition
to
prefer
an
ugly
old
maid
in
a
rage
or
an
ugly
old
maid
in
tears
miss
jillgall
presented
herself
in
both
characters
when
she
heard
what
had
happened
to
my
mind
tenbruggen
s
is
a
creature
not
fit
to
be
seen
or
heard
when
she
loses
her
temper
i
only
told
her
to
leave
the
room
to
my
great
amusement
she
shook
her
bony
fist
at
me
and
expressed
a
frantic
wish
oh
if
i
was
rich
enough
to
leave
this
wicked
house
i
wonder
whether
there
is
insanity
as
well
as
poverty
in
miss
jillgall
s
family
last
night
my
mind
was
in
a
harassed
state
philip
was
as
usual
the
cause
of
it
perhaps
i
acted
indiscreetly
when
i
insisted
on
his
leaving
london
and
returning
to
this
place
but
what
else
could
i
have
done
it
was
not
merely
my
interest
it
was
an
act
of
downright
necessity
to
withdraw
him
from
the
influence
of
his
hateful
father
whom
i
now
regard
as
the
one
serious
obstacle
to
my
marriage
there
is
no
prospect
of
being
rid
of
dunboyne
the
elder
by
his
returning
to
ireland
he
is
trying
a
new
remedy
for
his
crippled
hand
electricity
i
wish
it
was
lightning
to
kill
him
if
i
had
given
that
wicked
old
man
the
chance
i
am
firmly
convinced
he
would
not
have
let
a
day
pass
without
doing
his
best
to
depreciate
me
in
his
son
s
estimation
besides
there
was
the
risk
if
i
had
allowed
philip
to
remain
long
away
from
me
of
losing
no
while
i
keep
my
beauty
i
can
not
be
in
such
danger
as
that
let
me
say
of
permitting
time
and
absence
to
weaken
my
hold
on
him
however
sullen
and
silent
he
may
be
when
we
meet
and
i
find
him
in
that
condition
far
too
often
i
can
sooner
or
later
recall
him
to
his
brighter
self
my
eyes
preserve
their
charm
my
talk
can
still
amuse
him
and
better
even
than
that
i
feel
the
answering
thrill
in
him
which
tells
me
how
precious
my
kisses
are
not
too
lavishly
bestowed
but
the
time
when
i
am
obliged
to
leave
him
to
himself
is
the
time
that
i
dread
how
do
i
know
that
his
thoughts
are
not
wandering
away
to
eunice
he
denies
it
he
declares
that
he
only
went
to
the
farmhouse
to
express
his
regret
for
his
own
thoughtless
conduct
and
to
offer
her
the
brotherly
regard
due
to
the
sister
of
his
promised
wife
can
i
believe
it
oh
what
would
i
not
give
to
be
able
to
believe
it
how
can
i
feel
sure
that
her
refusal
to
see
him
was
not
a
cunning
device
to
make
him
long
for
another
interview
and
plan
perhaps
in
private
to
go
back
and
try
again
marriage
nothing
will
quiet
these
frightful
doubts
of
mine
nothing
will
reward
me
for
all
that
i
have
suffered
nothing
will
warm
my
heart
with
the
delightful
sense
of
triumph
over
eunice
but
my
marriage
to
philip
and
what
does
he
say
when
i
urge
it
on
him
yes
i
have
fallen
as
low
as
that
in
the
despair
which
sometimes
possesses
me
he
has
his
answer
always
the
same
and
always
ready
how
are
we
to
live
where
is
the
money
the
maddening
part
of
it
is
that
i
can
not
accuse
him
of
raising
objections
that
don
t
exist
we
are
poorer
than
ever
here
since
my
father
s
illness
and
philip
s
allowance
is
barely
enough
to
suffice
him
as
a
single
man
oh
how
i
hate
the
rich
it
was
useless
to
think
of
going
to
bed
how
could
i
hope
to
sleep
with
my
head
throbbing
and
my
thoughts
in
this
disturbed
state
i
put
on
my
comfortable
and
sat
down
to
try
what
reading
would
do
to
quiet
my
mind
i
had
borrowed
the
book
from
the
library
to
which
i
have
been
a
subscriber
in
secret
for
some
time
past
it
was
an
old
volume
full
of
what
we
should
now
call
gossip
relating
strange
adventures
and
scandalous
incidents
in
family
history
which
had
been
concealed
from
public
notice
one
of
these
last
romances
in
real
life
caught
a
strong
hold
on
my
interest
it
was
a
strange
case
of
intended
poisoning
which
had
never
been
carried
out
a
young
married
lady
of
rank
whose
name
was
concealed
under
an
initial
letter
had
suffered
some
unendurable
wrong
which
was
not
mentioned
at
the
hands
of
her
husband
s
mother
the
wife
was
described
as
a
woman
of
strong
passions
who
had
determined
on
a
terrible
revenge
by
taking
the
life
of
her
there
were
difficulties
in
the
way
of
her
committing
the
crime
without
an
accomplice
to
help
her
and
she
decided
on
taking
her
maid
an
elderly
woman
into
her
confidence
the
poison
was
secretly
obtained
by
this
person
and
the
safest
manner
of
administering
it
was
under
discussion
between
the
mistress
and
the
maid
when
the
door
of
the
room
was
suddenly
opened
the
husband
accompanied
by
his
brother
rushed
in
and
charged
his
wife
with
plotting
the
murder
of
his
mother
the
young
lady
she
was
only
must
have
been
a
person
of
extraordinary
courage
and
resolution
she
saw
at
once
that
her
maid
had
betrayed
her
and
with
astonishing
presence
of
mind
she
turned
on
the
traitress
and
said
to
her
husband
there
is
the
wretch
who
has
been
trying
to
persuade
me
to
poison
your
mother
as
it
happened
the
old
lady
s
temper
was
violent
and
overbearing
and
the
maid
had
complained
of
being
by
her
in
the
hearing
of
the
other
servants
the
circumstances
made
it
impossible
to
decide
which
of
the
two
was
really
the
guilty
woman
the
servant
was
sent
away
and
the
husband
and
wife
separated
soon
afterward
under
the
excuse
of
incompatibility
of
temper
years
passed
and
the
truth
was
only
discovered
by
the
confession
of
the
wife
a
remarkable
story
which
has
made
such
an
impression
on
me
that
i
have
written
it
in
my
journal
i
am
not
rich
enough
to
buy
the
book
for
the
last
two
days
i
have
been
confined
to
my
room
with
a
bad
feverish
cold
caught
as
i
suppose
by
sitting
at
an
open
window
reading
my
book
till
nearly
three
o
clock
in
the
morning
i
sent
a
note
to
philip
telling
him
of
my
illness
on
the
first
day
he
called
to
inquire
after
me
on
the
second
day
no
visit
and
no
letter
here
is
the
third
day
and
no
news
of
him
as
yet
i
am
better
but
not
fit
to
go
out
let
me
wait
another
hour
and
if
that
exertion
of
patience
meets
with
no
reward
i
shall
send
a
note
to
the
hotel
no
news
of
philip
i
have
sent
to
the
hotel
the
servant
has
just
returned
bringing
me
back
my
note
the
waiter
informed
her
that
dunboyne
had
gone
away
to
london
by
the
morning
train
no
apology
or
explanation
left
for
me
he
have
deserted
me
i
am
in
such
a
frenzy
of
doubt
and
rage
that
i
can
hardly
write
that
horrible
question
is
it
possible
oh
i
feel
it
possible
that
he
has
gone
away
with
eunice
do
i
know
where
to
find
them
if
i
did
know
what
could
i
do
i
feel
as
if
i
could
kill
them

resumed
after
the
heat
of
my
anger
had
cooled
i
made
two
discoveries
one
cost
me
a
fee
to
a
messenger
and
the
other
exposed
me
to
the
insolence
of
a
servant
i
pay
willingly
in
my
purse
and
my
pride
when
the
gain
is
peace
of
mind
through
my
messenger
i
ascertained
that
eunice
had
never
left
the
farm
through
my
own
inquiries
answered
by
the
waiter
with
an
impudent
grin
i
heard
that
philip
had
left
orders
to
have
his
room
kept
for
him
what
misery
our
stupid
housemaid
might
have
spared
me
if
she
had
thought
of
putting
that
question
when
i
sent
her
to
the
hotel
the
rest
of
the
day
passed
in
vain
speculations
on
philip
s
motive
for
this
sudden
departure
what
poor
weak
creatures
we
are
i
persuaded
myself
to
hope
that
anxiety
for
our
marriage
had
urged
him
to
make
an
effort
to
touch
the
heart
of
his
mean
father
shall
i
see
him
and
shall
i
have
reason
to
be
fonder
of
him
than
ever
we
met
again
as
usual
he
has
behaved
infamously
when
i
asked
what
had
been
his
object
in
going
to
london
i
was
told
that
it
was
a
matter
of
he
made
that
idiotic
excuse
as
coolly
as
if
he
really
thought
i
should
believe
it
i
submitted
in
silence
rather
than
mar
his
return
to
me
by
the
disaster
of
a
quarrel
but
this
was
an
unlucky
day
a
harder
trial
of
my
was
still
to
come
without
the
slightest
appearance
of
shame
philip
informed
me
that
he
was
charged
with
a
message
from
tenbruggen
she
wanted
some
irish
lace
and
would
i
be
so
good
as
to
tell
her
which
was
the
best
shop
at
which
she
could
buy
it
was
he
really
in
earnest
you
i
said
who
distrusted
and
detested
her
you
are
on
friendly
terms
with
that
woman
he
remonstrated
with
me
my
dear
helena
don
t
speak
in
that
way
of
tenbruggen
we
have
both
been
mistaken
about
her
that
good
creature
has
forgiven
the
brutal
manner
in
which
i
spoke
to
her
when
she
was
in
attendance
on
my
father
she
was
the
first
to
propose
that
we
should
shake
hands
and
forget
it
my
darling
don
t
let
all
the
good
feeling
be
on
one
side
you
have
no
idea
how
kindly
she
speaks
of
you
and
how
anxious
she
is
to
help
us
to
be
married
come
come
meet
her
write
down
the
name
of
the
shop
on
my
card
and
i
will
take
it
back
to
sheer
amazement
kept
me
silent
i
let
him
go
on
he
was
a
mere
child
in
the
hands
of
tenbruggen
she
had
only
to
determine
to
make
a
fool
of
him
and
she
could
do
it
but
why
did
she
do
it
what
advantage
had
she
to
gain
by
insinuating
herself
in
this
way
into
his
good
opinion
evidently
with
the
intention
of
urging
him
to
reconcile
us
to
each
other
how
could
we
two
poor
young
people
be
of
the
smallest
use
to
the
fashionable
masseuse
my
silence
began
to
irritate
philip
i
never
knew
before
how
obstinate
you
could
be
he
said
you
seem
to
be
doing
your
best
i
can
t
imagine
why
to
lower
yourself
in
my
i
held
my
tongue
i
assumed
my
smile
it
is
all
very
well
for
men
to
talk
about
the
deceitfulness
of
women
what
chance
i
should
like
to
ask
somebody
who
knows
about
it
do
the
men
give
us
of
making
our
lives
with
them
endurable
except
by
deceit
i
gave
way
of
course
and
wrote
down
the
address
of
the
shop
he
was
so
pleased
that
he
kissed
me
yes
the
most
fondly
affectionate
kiss
that
he
had
given
me
for
weeks
past
was
my
reward
for
submitting
to
tenbruggen
she
is
old
enough
to
be
his
mother
and
almost
as
ugly
as
miss
jillgall
and
she
has
made
her
interests
his
interests
already
on
the
next
day
i
fully
expected
to
receive
a
visit
from
tenbruggen
she
knew
better
than
that
i
only
got
a
polite
little
note
thanking
me
for
the
address
and
adding
an
artless
concession
i
earn
more
money
than
i
know
what
to
do
with
and
i
adore
irish
the
next
day
came
and
still
she
was
careful
not
to
show
herself
too
eager
for
a
personal
reconciliation
a
splendid
nosegay
was
sent
to
me
with
another
little
note
a
tribute
dear
helena
offered
by
one
of
my
grateful
patients
too
beautiful
a
present
for
an
old
woman
like
me
i
agree
with
the
poet
sweets
to
the
a
charming
thought
of
shakespeare
s
is
it
not
i
should
like
to
verify
the
quotation
would
you
mind
leaving
the
volume
for
me
in
the
hall
if
i
call
well
done
tenbruggen
she
doesn
t
venture
to
intrude
on
miss
gracedieu
in
the
she
only
wants
to
verify
a
quotation
in
the
hall
oh
goddess
of
humility
if
there
is
such
a
person
how
becomingly
you
are
dressed
when
your
milliner
is
an
artful
old
woman
while
this
reflection
was
passing
through
my
mind
miss
jillgall
came
in
saw
the
nosegay
on
the
table
and
instantly
pounced
on
it
oh
for
me
for
me
she
cried
i
noticed
it
this
morning
on
elizabeth
s
table
how
very
kind
of
her
she
plunged
her
inquisitive
nose
into
the
poor
flowers
and
looked
up
sentimentally
at
the
ceiling
the
perfume
of
goodness
she
remarked
mingled
with
the
perfume
of
flowers
when
you
have
quite
done
with
it
i
said
perhaps
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
return
my
nosegay
nosegay
she
exclaimed
there
is
tenbruggen
s
letter
i
replied
if
you
would
like
to
look
at
she
did
look
at
it
all
the
bile
in
her
body
flew
up
into
her
eyes
and
turned
them
green
she
looked
as
if
she
longed
to
scratch
my
face
i
gave
the
flowers
afterward
to
maria
miss
jillgall
s
nose
had
completely
spoiled
them
it
would
have
been
too
ridiculous
to
have
allowed
tenbruggen
to
consult
shakespeare
in
the
hall
i
had
the
honor
of
receiving
her
in
my
own
room
we
accomplished
a
touching
reconciliation
and
we
quite
forgot
shakespeare
she
troubles
me
she
does
indeed
trouble
me
having
set
herself
entirely
right
with
philip
she
is
determined
on
performing
the
same
miracle
with
me
her
reform
of
herself
is
already
complete
her
vulgar
humor
was
kept
under
strict
restraint
she
was
quiet
and
and
readier
to
listen
than
to
talk
this
change
was
not
presented
abruptly
she
contrived
to
express
her
friendly
interests
in
philip
and
in
me
by
hints
dropped
here
and
there
assisted
in
their
effort
by
answers
on
my
part
into
which
i
was
tempted
so
skillfully
that
i
only
discovered
the
snare
set
for
me
on
reflection
what
is
it
i
ask
again
that
she
has
in
view
in
taking
all
this
trouble
where
is
her
motive
for
encouraging
a
which
miss
jillgall
must
have
denounced
to
her
as
an
abominable
wrong
inflicted
on
eunice
money
even
if
there
was
a
prospect
of
such
a
thing
in
our
case
can
not
be
her
object
it
is
quite
true
that
her
success
sets
her
above
pecuniary
anxiety
spiteful
feeling
against
eunice
is
out
of
the
question
they
have
only
met
once
and
her
opinion
was
expressed
to
me
with
evident
sincerity
your
sister
is
a
nice
girl
but
she
is
like
other
nice
girls
she
doesn
t
interest
there
is
eunice
s
character
drawn
from
the
life
in
few
words
in
what
an
irritating
position
do
i
find
myself
placed
never
before
have
i
felt
so
interested
in
trying
to
look
into
a
person
s
secret
mind
and
never
before
have
i
been
so
completely
baffled
i
had
written
as
far
as
this
and
was
on
the
point
of
closing
my
journal
when
a
third
note
arrived
from
tenbruggen
she
had
been
thinking
about
me
at
intervals
she
wrote
all
through
the
rest
of
the
day
and
kindly
as
i
had
received
her
she
was
conscious
of
being
the
object
of
doubts
on
my
part
which
her
visit
had
failed
to
remove
might
she
ask
leave
to
call
on
me
in
the
hope
of
improving
her
position
in
my
estimation
an
appointment
followed
for
the
next
day
what
can
she
have
to
say
to
me
which
she
has
not
already
said
is
it
anything
about
philip
i
wonder

resumed
at
our
interview
of
the
next
day
tenbruggen
s
capacity
for
appeared
under
a
new
aspect
she
dropped
all
familiarity
with
me
and
she
stated
the
object
of
her
visit
without
a
superfluous
word
of
explanation
or
apology
i
thought
this
a
remarkable
effort
for
a
woman
and
i
recognized
the
merit
of
it
by
leaving
the
lion
s
share
of
the
talk
to
my
visitor
in
these
terms
she
opened
her
business
with
me
has
philip
dunboyne
told
you
why
he
went
to
london
he
made
a
commonplace
excuse
i
answered
business
he
said
took
him
to
london
i
know
no
you
have
a
fair
prospect
of
happiness
miss
helena
when
you
are
married
your
future
husband
is
evidently
afraid
of
you
i
am
not
afraid
of
you
and
i
shall
confide
to
your
private
ear
something
which
you
have
an
interest
in
knowing
the
business
which
took
young
dunboyne
to
london
was
to
consult
a
competent
person
on
a
matter
concerning
himself
the
competent
person
is
the
sagacious
not
to
say
sly
old
gentleman
whom
we
used
to
call
the
governor
you
know
him
i
believe
yes
but
i
am
at
a
loss
to
imagine
why
philip
should
have
consulted
have
you
ever
heard
or
read
miss
helena
of
such
a
thing
as
an
old
man
s
fancy
i
think
i
well
the
governor
has
taken
an
old
man
s
fancy
to
your
sister
they
appeared
to
understand
each
other
perfectly
when
i
was
at
the
excuse
me
tenbruggen
that
is
what
i
know
already
why
did
philip
go
to
the
governor
she
smiled
if
anybody
is
acquainted
with
the
true
state
of
your
sister
s
feelings
the
governor
is
the
man
i
sent
dunboyne
to
consult
him
and
there
is
the
reason
for
this
open
avowal
of
her
motives
perplexed
and
offended
me
after
declaring
herself
to
be
interested
in
my
had
she
changed
her
mind
and
resolved
on
favoring
philip
s
return
to
eunice
what
right
had
he
to
consult
anybody
about
the
state
of
that
girl
s
feelings
feelings
form
the
only
subject
of
inquiry
that
was
properly
open
to
him
i
should
have
said
something
which
i
might
have
afterward
regretted
if
tenbruggen
had
allowed
me
the
opportunity
fortunately
for
both
of
us
she
went
on
with
her
narrative
of
her
own
proceedings
philip
dunboyne
is
an
excellent
fellow
she
continued
i
really
like
him
but
he
has
his
faults
he
sadly
wants
strength
of
purpose
and
like
weak
men
in
general
he
only
knows
his
own
mind
when
a
resolute
friend
takes
him
in
hand
and
guides
him
i
am
his
resolute
friend
i
saw
him
veering
about
between
you
and
eunice
and
i
decided
for
his
sake
may
i
say
for
your
sake
also
on
putting
an
end
to
that
mischievous
state
of
indecision
you
have
the
claim
on
him
you
are
the
right
wife
for
him
and
the
governor
was
as
i
thought
likely
from
what
i
had
myself
observed
the
man
to
make
him
see
it
i
am
not
in
anybody
s
secrets
it
was
pure
guesswork
on
my
part
and
it
has
succeeded
there
is
no
more
doubt
now
about
miss
eunice
s
sentiments
the
question
is
in
my
favor
certainly
in
your
favor
or
i
should
not
have
said
a
word
about
was
philip
s
visit
kindly
received
or
did
the
old
wretch
laugh
at
him
my
dear
miss
gracedieu
the
old
wretch
is
a
man
of
the
world
and
never
makes
mistakes
of
that
sort
before
he
could
open
his
lips
he
had
to
satisfy
himself
that
your
lover
deserved
to
be
taken
into
his
confidence
on
the
delicate
subject
of
eunice
s
sentiments
he
arrived
at
a
favorable
conclusion
i
can
repeat
philip
s
questions
and
the
governor
s
answers
after
putting
the
young
man
through
a
stiff
examination
just
as
they
passed
may
i
inquire
sir
if
she
has
spoken
to
you
about
me
she
has
often
spoken
about
did
she
seem
to
be
angry
with
me
she
is
too
good
and
too
sweet
to
be
angry
with
do
you
think
she
will
forgive
me
she
has
forgiven
did
she
say
so
herself
yes
of
her
own
free
why
did
she
refuse
to
see
me
when
i
called
at
the
farm
she
had
her
own
reasons
good
has
she
regretted
it
since
certainly
is
it
likely
that
she
would
consent
if
i
proposed
a
reconciliation
i
put
that
question
to
her
how
did
she
take
it
sir
she
declined
to
take
you
mean
that
she
declined
a
reconciliation
are
you
sure
she
was
in
earnest
i
am
positively
that
last
answer
seems
by
young
dunboyne
s
own
confession
to
have
been
enough
and
more
than
enough
for
him
he
got
up
to
go
and
then
an
odd
thing
happened
after
giving
him
the
most
unfavorable
answers
the
governor
patted
him
paternally
on
the
shoulder
and
encouraged
him
to
hope
before
we
say
philip
one
word
more
if
i
was
as
young
as
you
are
i
should
not
there
is
a
sudden
change
of
front
who
can
explain
it
the
governor
s
mischievous
resolution
to
reconcile
philip
and
eunice
explained
it
of
course
with
the
best
intentions
perhaps
tenbruggen
had
helped
that
design
by
bringing
the
two
men
together
go
on
i
said
i
am
prepared
to
hear
next
that
philip
has
paid
another
visit
to
my
sister
and
has
been
received
this
i
must
say
this
for
tenbruggen
she
kept
her
temper
perfectly
he
has
not
been
to
the
farm
she
said
but
he
has
done
something
nearly
as
foolish
he
has
written
to
your
and
he
has
received
a
favorable
reply
of
course
she
put
her
hand
into
the
pocket
of
her
dress
there
is
your
sister
s
reply
she
said
any
persons
who
have
had
a
crushing
burden
lifted
unexpectedly
and
instantly
from
off
their
minds
will
know
what
i
felt
when
i
read
the
reply
in
the
most
positive
language
eunice
refused
to
correspond
with
philip
or
to
speak
with
him
the
concluding
words
proved
that
she
was
in
earnest
you
are
engaged
to
helena
consider
me
as
a
stranger
until
you
are
married
after
that
time
you
will
be
my
and
then
i
may
pardon
you
for
writing
to
nobody
who
knows
eunice
would
have
supposed
that
she
possessed
those
two
valuable
qualities
and
proper
pride
it
is
pleasant
to
feel
that
i
can
now
send
cards
to
my
sister
when
i
am
philip
dunboyne
i
returned
the
letter
to
tenbruggen
with
the
sincerest
expressions
of
regret
for
having
doubted
her
i
have
been
unworthy
of
your
generous
interest
in
me
i
said
i
am
almost
ashamed
to
offer
you
my
she
took
my
hand
and
gave
it
a
good
heady
shake
are
we
friends
she
asked
in
the
simplest
and
prettiest
manner
then
let
us
be
easy
and
pleasant
again
she
went
on
will
you
call
me
elizabeth
and
shall
i
call
you
helena
very
well
now
i
have
got
something
else
to
say
another
secret
which
must
be
kept
from
philip
i
call
by
his
name
now
you
see
for
a
few
days
more
your
happiness
my
dear
must
not
depend
on
his
miserly
old
father
he
must
have
a
little
income
of
his
own
to
marry
on
among
the
hundreds
of
unfortunate
wretches
whom
i
have
relieved
from
torture
of
mind
and
body
there
is
a
grateful
minority
small
small
but
there
they
are
i
have
influence
among
powerful
people
and
i
am
trying
to
make
philip
private
secretary
to
a
member
of
parliament
when
i
have
succeeded
you
shall
tell
him
the
good
what
a
vile
humor
i
must
have
been
in
at
the
time
not
to
have
appreciated
the
delightful
gayety
of
this
good
creature
i
went
to
the
other
extreme
now
and
behaved
like
a
gushing
young
miss
fresh
from
school
i
kissed
her
she
burst
out
laughing
what
a
sacrifice
she
cried
a
kiss
for
me
which
ought
to
have
been
kept
for
philip
do
you
know
what
i
should
do
helena
in
your
place
i
should
take
our
handsome
young
man
away
from
that
hotel
i
will
do
anything
that
you
advise
i
said
and
you
will
do
well
my
child
in
the
first
place
the
hotel
is
too
expensive
for
philip
s
small
means
in
the
second
place
two
of
the
chambermaids
have
audaciously
presumed
to
be
charming
girls
and
the
men
my
dear
well
well
i
will
leave
you
to
find
that
out
for
yourself
in
the
third
place
you
want
to
have
philip
under
your
own
wing
domestic
familiarity
will
make
him
fonder
of
you
than
ever
keep
him
out
of
the
sort
of
company
that
he
meets
with
in
the
and
the
you
have
got
a
spare
bed
here
i
know
and
your
poor
father
is
in
no
condition
to
use
his
authority
make
philip
one
of
the
this
last
piece
of
advice
staggered
me
i
mentioned
the
proprieties
tenbruggen
laughed
at
the
proprieties
make
selina
of
some
use
she
suggested
while
you
have
got
in
the
house
propriety
is
rampant
why
condemn
poor
helpless
philip
to
cheap
lodgings
time
enough
to
cast
him
out
to
the
and
the
fleas
on
the
night
before
your
marriage
besides
i
shall
be
in
and
out
constantly
for
i
mean
to
cure
your
father
the
tongue
of
scandal
is
silent
in
my
awful
presence
an
atmosphere
of
virtue
surrounds
mamma
tenbruggen
think
of
chapter
lv
helena
s
diary
resumed
i
did
think
of
it
philip
came
to
us
and
lived
in
our
house
let
me
hasten
to
add
that
the
protest
of
propriety
was
duly
entered
on
the
day
before
my
promised
husband
arrived
standing
in
the
doorway
nothing
would
induce
her
to
take
a
chair
or
even
to
enter
the
room
miss
jillgall
delivered
her
opinion
on
philip
s
approaching
visit
tenbruggen
reported
it
in
her
as
if
she
was
representing
a
newspaper
at
a
public
meeting
here
it
is
copied
from
her
notes
miss
helena
gracedieu
my
first
impulse
under
the
present
disgusting
circumstances
was
to
leave
the
house
and
earn
a
bare
crust
in
the
cheapest
garret
i
could
find
in
the
town
but
my
grateful
heart
remembers
gracedieu
my
poor
afflicted
cousin
was
good
to
me
when
i
was
helpless
i
can
not
forsake
him
when
is
helpless
at
whatever
sacrifice
of
my
own
i
remain
under
this
roof
so
dear
to
me
for
the
minister
s
sake
i
notice
miss
that
you
smile
i
see
my
once
dear
elizabeth
the
friend
who
has
so
bitterly
disappointed
me
she
stopped
and
put
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
and
went
on
again
the
friend
who
has
so
bitterly
disappointed
me
taking
satirical
notes
of
what
i
say
i
am
not
ashamed
of
what
i
say
the
virtue
which
will
not
stretch
a
little
where
the
motive
is
good
is
feeble
virtue
indeed
i
shall
stay
in
the
house
and
witness
horrors
and
rise
superior
to
them
miss
gracedieu
she
performed
a
magnificent
curtsey
and
as
tenbruggen
s
experience
of
the
stage
informed
me
made
a
very
creditable
exit
a
week
has
passed
and
i
have
not
opened
my
diary
my
days
have
glided
away
in
one
delicious
flow
of
happiness
philip
has
been
delightfully
devoted
to
me
his
fervent
courtship
far
exceeding
any
similar
attentions
which
he
may
once
have
paid
to
eunice
has
shown
such
variety
and
such
steadfastness
of
worship
that
i
despair
of
describing
it
my
enjoyment
of
my
new
life
is
to
be
felt
not
to
be
coldly
considered
and
reduced
to
an
imperfect
statement
in
words
for
the
first
time
i
feel
capable
if
the
circumstances
encouraged
me
of
acts
of
exalted
virtue
for
instance
i
could
save
my
country
if
my
country
was
worth
it
i
could
die
a
martyr
to
religion
if
i
had
a
religion
in
one
word
i
am
exceedingly
well
satisfied
with
myself
the
little
disappointments
of
life
pass
over
me
harmless
i
do
not
even
regret
the
failure
of
good
tenbruggen
s
efforts
to
find
an
employment
for
philip
worthy
of
his
abilities
and
accomplishments
the
member
of
parliament
to
whom
she
had
applied
has
chosen
a
secretary
possessed
of
political
influence
that
is
the
excuse
put
forward
in
his
letter
to
tenbruggen
wretched
corrupt
creature
if
he
was
worth
a
thought
i
should
pity
him
he
has
lost
philip
s
services
three
days
more
have
slipped
by
the
aspect
of
my
heaven
on
earth
is
beginning
to
alter
perhaps
the
author
of
that
wonderful
french
novel
l
ame
damne
e
is
right
when
he
tells
us
that
human
happiness
is
misery
in
masquerade
it
would
be
wrong
to
say
that
i
am
miserable
but
i
may
be
on
the
way
to
it
i
am
anxious
when
he
did
not
know
that
i
was
observing
him
i
discovered
a
preoccupied
look
in
philip
s
eyes
he
laughed
when
i
asked
if
anything
had
happened
to
vex
him
was
it
a
natural
laugh
he
put
his
arm
round
me
and
kissed
me
was
it
done
mechanically
i
daresay
i
am
out
of
humor
myself
i
think
i
had
a
little
headache
morbid
probably
i
won
t
think
of
it
any
more
it
has
occurred
to
me
this
morning
that
he
may
dislike
being
left
by
himself
while
i
am
engaged
in
my
household
affairs
if
this
is
the
case
intensely
as
i
hate
her
utterly
as
i
loathe
the
idea
of
putting
her
in
command
over
my
domestic
dominions
i
shall
ask
miss
jillgall
to
take
my
place
as
housekeeper
i
was
away
in
the
kitchen
regions
rather
longer
than
usual
when
i
had
done
with
my
worries
philip
was
not
to
be
found
maria
looking
out
of
one
of
the
bedroom
windows
instead
of
doing
her
work
had
seen
dunboyne
leave
the
house
it
was
possible
that
he
had
charged
miss
jillgall
with
a
message
for
me
i
asked
if
she
was
in
her
room
no
she
too
had
gone
out
it
was
a
fine
day
and
philip
had
no
doubt
taken
a
stroll
but
he
might
have
waited
till
i
could
join
him
there
were
some
orders
to
be
given
to
the
butcher
and
the
i
too
left
the
house
hoping
to
get
rid
of
some
little
discontent
caused
by
thinking
of
what
had
happened
returning
by
the
way
of
high
street
i
declare
i
can
hardly
believe
it
even
now
i
did
positively
see
miss
jillgall
coming
out
of
a
pawnbroker
s
shop
the
direction
in
which
she
turned
prevented
her
from
seeing
me
she
was
quite
unaware
that
i
had
discovered
her
and
i
have
said
nothing
about
it
since
but
i
noticed
something
unusual
in
the
manner
in
which
her
was
hanging
and
i
asked
her
what
o
clock
it
was
she
said
you
have
got
your
own
i
told
her
my
watch
had
stopped
so
has
mine
she
said
there
is
no
doubt
about
it
now
she
has
pawned
her
watch
what
for
she
lives
here
for
nothing
and
she
has
not
had
a
new
dress
since
i
have
known
her
why
does
she
want
money
philip
had
not
returned
when
i
got
home
another
mysterious
journey
to
london
no
after
an
absence
of
more
than
two
hours
he
came
back
naturally
enough
i
asked
what
he
had
been
about
he
had
been
taking
a
long
walk
for
his
health
s
sake
no
to
think
to
think
of
what
well
i
might
be
surprised
to
hear
it
but
his
idle
life
was
beginning
to
weigh
on
his
spirits
he
wanted
employment
had
he
thought
of
an
employment
not
yet
which
way
had
he
walked
anyway
he
had
not
noticed
where
he
went
these
replies
were
all
made
in
a
tone
that
offended
me
besides
i
observed
there
was
no
dust
on
his
boots
after
a
week
of
dry
weather
and
his
walk
of
two
hours
did
not
appear
to
have
heated
or
tired
him
i
took
an
opportunity
of
consulting
tenbruggen
she
had
anticipated
that
i
should
appeal
to
her
opinion
as
a
woman
of
the
world
i
shall
not
set
down
in
detail
what
she
said
some
of
it
humiliated
me
and
from
some
of
it
i
recoiled
the
expression
of
her
opinion
came
to
this
in
the
absence
of
experience
a
certain
fervor
of
temperament
was
essential
to
success
in
the
art
of
fascinating
men
either
my
temperament
was
deficient
or
my
intellect
overpowered
it
it
was
natural
that
i
should
suppose
myself
to
be
as
susceptible
to
the
tender
passion
as
the
most
excitable
woman
living
delusion
my
helena
amiable
delusion
had
i
ever
observed
or
had
any
friend
told
me
that
my
pretty
hands
were
cold
hands
i
had
beautiful
eyes
expressive
of
vivacity
of
intelligence
of
every
feminine
charm
except
the
one
inviting
charm
that
finds
favor
in
the
eyes
of
a
man
she
then
entered
into
particulars
which
i
don
t
deny
showed
a
true
interest
in
helping
me
i
was
ungrateful
sulky
dating
from
that
day
s
talk
with
tenbruggen
my
new
friendship
began
to
show
signs
of
having
caught
a
chill
but
i
did
my
best
to
follow
her
instructions
and
failed
it
is
perhaps
true
that
my
temperament
is
overpowered
by
my
intellect
or
it
is
possibly
truer
still
that
the
fire
in
my
heart
when
it
warms
to
love
is
a
fire
that
burns
low
my
belief
is
that
i
surprised
philip
instead
of
charming
him
he
responded
to
my
advances
but
i
felt
that
it
was
not
done
in
earnest
not
spontaneously
had
i
any
right
to
complain
was
i
in
earnest
was
i
spontaneous
we
were
making
love
to
each
other
under
false
pretenses
oh
what
a
fool
i
was
to
ask
for
tenbruggen
s
advice
a
humiliating
doubt
has
come
to
me
suddenly
has
his
heart
been
inclining
to
eunice
again
after
such
a
letter
as
she
has
written
to
him
impossible
three
events
since
yesterday
which
i
consider
trifling
as
they
may
be
intimations
of
something
wrong
first
miss
jillgall
who
at
one
time
was
eager
to
take
my
place
has
refused
to
relieve
me
of
my
housekeeping
duties
secondly
philip
has
been
absent
again
on
another
long
walk
thirdly
when
philip
returned
depressed
and
sulky
i
caught
miss
jillgall
looking
at
him
with
interest
and
pity
visible
in
her
skinny
face
what
do
these
things
mean
i
am
beginning
to
doubt
everybody
not
one
of
them
philip
included
cares
for
me
but
i
can
frighten
them
at
any
rate
yesterday
evening
i
dropped
on
the
floor
as
suddenly
as
if
i
had
been
shot
a
fit
of
some
sort
the
doctor
honestly
declared
that
he
was
at
a
loss
to
account
for
it
he
would
have
laid
me
under
an
eternal
obligation
if
he
had
failed
to
bring
me
back
to
life
again
as
it
is
i
am
more
clever
than
the
doctor
what
brought
the
fit
on
is
well
known
to
me
rage
furious
overpowering
deadly
rage
was
the
cause
i
am
now
in
the
state
which
can
look
back
at
the
event
as
composedly
as
if
it
had
happened
to
some
other
girl
suppose
that
girl
had
let
her
sweetheart
know
how
she
loved
him
as
she
had
never
let
him
know
it
before
suppose
she
opened
the
door
again
the
instant
after
she
had
left
the
room
eager
poor
wretch
to
say
once
more
for
the
fiftieth
time
my
angel
i
love
you
suppose
she
found
her
angel
standing
with
his
back
toward
her
so
that
his
face
was
reflected
in
the
glass
and
suppose
she
discovered
in
that
face
so
smiling
and
so
sweet
when
his
head
had
rested
on
her
bosom
only
the
moment
before
the
most
hideous
expression
of
disgust
that
features
can
betray
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
it
i
had
made
my
poor
offering
of
love
to
a
man
who
secretly
loathed
me
i
wonder
that
i
survived
my
sense
of
my
own
degradation
well
i
am
alive
and
i
know
him
in
his
true
character
at
last
am
i
a
woman
who
submits
when
an
outrage
is
offered
to
her
what
will
happen
next
who
knows
i
am
in
a
fine
humor
what
i
have
just
written
has
set
me
laughing
at
myself
helena
gracedieu
has
one
merit
at
least
she
is
a
very
amusing
person
i
slept
last
night
this
morning
i
am
strong
again
calm
wickedly
capable
of
deceiving
philip
dunboyne
as
he
has
deceived
me
he
has
not
the
faintest
suspicion
that
i
have
discovered
him
i
wish
he
had
courage
enough
to
kill
somebody
how
i
should
enjoy
hiring
the
nearest
window
to
the
scaffold
and
seeing
him
hanged
miss
jillgall
is
in
better
spirits
than
ever
she
is
going
to
take
a
little
holiday
and
the
cunning
creature
makes
a
mystery
of
it
miss
helena
i
am
going
to
stay
for
a
day
or
two
with
a
what
friend
who
cares
last
night
i
was
wakeful
in
the
darkness
a
daring
idea
came
to
me
i
have
carried
out
the
idea
something
has
followed
which
is
well
worth
entering
in
my
diary
i
left
the
room
at
the
usual
hour
for
attending
to
my
domestic
affairs
the
obstinate
cook
did
me
a
service
she
was
insolent
she
wanted
to
have
her
own
way
i
gave
her
her
own
way
in
less
than
five
minutes
i
was
on
the
watch
in
the
pantry
which
has
a
view
of
the
house
door
my
hat
and
my
parasol
were
waiting
for
me
on
the
table
in
case
of
my
going
out
too
in
a
few
minutes
more
i
heard
the
door
opened
philip
dunboyne
stepped
out
he
was
going
to
take
another
of
his
long
walks
i
followed
him
to
the
street
in
which
the
cabs
stand
he
hired
the
first
one
on
the
rank
an
open
chaise
while
i
kept
myself
hidden
in
a
shop
door
the
moment
he
started
on
his
drive
i
hired
a
closed
cab
double
your
fare
i
said
to
the
driver
whatever
it
may
be
if
you
follow
that
chaise
cleverly
and
do
what
i
tell
he
nodded
and
winked
at
me
a
old
fellow
just
the
man
i
wanted
we
followed
the
chaise
chapter
lvi
helena
s
diary
resumed
when
we
had
left
the
town
behind
us
the
coachman
began
to
drive
more
slowly
in
my
ignorance
i
asked
what
this
change
in
the
pace
meant
he
pointed
with
his
whip
to
the
open
road
and
to
the
chaise
in
the
distance
if
we
keep
too
near
the
gentleman
miss
he
has
only
got
to
look
back
and
he
ll
see
we
are
following
him
the
safe
thing
to
do
is
to
let
the
chaise
get
on
a
bit
we
can
t
lose
sight
of
it
out
i
had
felt
inclined
to
trust
in
the
driver
s
experience
and
he
had
already
justified
my
confidence
in
him
this
encouraged
me
to
consult
his
opinion
on
a
matter
of
some
importance
to
my
present
interests
i
could
see
the
necessity
of
avoiding
discovery
when
we
had
followed
the
chaise
to
its
destination
but
i
was
totally
at
a
loss
to
know
how
it
could
be
done
my
wily
old
man
was
ready
with
his
advice
the
moment
i
asked
for
it
wherever
the
chaise
stops
miss
we
must
drive
past
it
as
if
we
were
going
somewhere
else
i
shall
notice
the
place
while
we
go
by
and
you
will
please
sit
back
in
the
corner
of
the
cab
so
that
the
gentleman
can
t
see
well
i
said
and
what
next
next
miss
i
shall
pull
up
wherever
it
may
be
out
of
sight
of
the
driver
of
the
chaise
he
bears
an
excellent
character
i
don
t
deny
it
but
i
ve
known
him
for
years
and
we
had
better
not
trust
him
i
shall
tell
you
where
the
gentleman
stopped
and
you
will
go
back
to
the
place
on
foot
of
course
and
see
for
yourself
what
s
to
be
done
specially
if
there
happens
to
be
a
lady
in
the
case
no
offense
miss
it
s
in
my
experience
that
there
s
generally
a
lady
in
the
case
anyhow
you
can
judge
for
yourself
and
you
ll
know
where
to
find
me
waiting
when
you
want
me
suppose
something
happens
i
suggested
that
we
don
t
expect
i
shan
t
lose
my
head
miss
whatever
all
very
well
coachman
but
i
have
only
your
word
for
in
the
irritable
state
of
my
mind
the
man
s
confident
way
of
thinking
annoyed
me
begging
your
pardon
my
young
lady
you
ve
got
if
i
may
say
so
what
they
call
a
guarantee
when
i
was
a
young
man
i
drove
a
cab
in
london
for
ten
years
will
that
do
i
suppose
you
mean
i
answered
that
you
have
learned
deceit
in
the
wicked
ways
of
the
great
he
took
this
as
a
compliment
thank
you
miss
that
s
it
after
a
long
drive
or
so
it
seemed
to
my
impatience
we
passed
the
chaise
drawn
up
at
a
lonely
house
separated
by
a
front
garden
from
the
road
in
two
or
three
minutes
more
we
stopped
where
the
road
took
a
turn
and
descended
to
lower
ground
the
farmhouse
which
we
had
left
behind
us
was
known
to
the
driver
he
led
the
way
to
a
gate
at
the
side
of
the
road
and
opened
it
for
me
in
your
place
miss
he
said
slyly
the
private
way
back
is
the
way
i
should
wish
to
take
try
it
by
the
fields
turn
to
the
right
when
you
have
passed
the
barn
and
you
ll
find
yourself
at
the
back
of
the
he
stopped
and
looked
at
his
big
silver
watch
twelve
he
said
the
chawbacons
i
mean
the
farmhouse
servants
miss
will
be
at
their
dinner
all
in
your
favor
so
far
if
the
dog
happens
to
be
loose
don
t
forget
that
his
name
s
grinder
call
him
by
his
name
and
pat
him
before
he
has
time
enough
to
think
and
he
ll
let
you
be
when
you
want
me
here
you
ll
find
me
waiting
for
i
looked
back
as
i
crossed
the
field
the
driver
was
sitting
on
the
gate
smoking
his
pipe
and
the
horse
was
nibbling
the
grass
at
the
roadside
two
happy
animals
without
a
burden
on
their
minds
after
passing
the
barn
i
saw
nothing
of
the
dog
far
or
near
no
living
creature
appeared
the
servants
must
have
been
at
dinner
as
the
coachman
had
foreseen
arriving
at
a
wooden
fence
i
opened
a
gate
in
it
and
found
myself
on
a
bit
of
waste
ground
on
my
left
there
was
a
large
on
my
right
i
saw
the
and
the
pigstyes
before
me
was
a
high
impenetrable
hedge
and
at
some
distance
behind
it
an
orchard
or
a
garden
as
i
supposed
filling
the
intermediate
space
rose
the
back
of
the
house
i
made
for
the
shelter
of
the
hedge
in
the
fear
that
some
one
might
approach
a
window
and
see
me
once
sheltered
from
observation
i
might
consider
what
i
should
do
next
it
was
impossible
to
doubt
that
this
was
the
house
in
which
eunice
was
living
neither
could
i
fail
to
conclude
that
philip
had
tried
to
persuade
her
to
see
him
on
those
former
occasions
when
he
told
me
he
had
taken
a
long
walk
as
i
crouched
behind
the
hedge
i
heard
voices
approaching
on
the
other
side
of
it
at
last
fortune
had
befriended
me
the
person
speaking
at
the
moment
was
miss
jillgall
and
the
person
who
answered
her
was
philip
i
am
afraid
dear
philip
you
don
t
quite
understand
my
sweet
euneece
honorable
high
minded
delicate
in
her
feelings
and
oh
so
unselfish
i
don
t
want
to
alarm
you
but
when
she
hears
you
have
been
deceiving
helena
upon
my
word
miss
jillgall
you
are
so
provoking
i
have
not
been
deceiving
helena
haven
t
i
told
you
what
discouraging
answers
i
got
when
i
went
to
see
the
governor
haven
t
i
shown
you
eunice
s
reply
to
my
letter
you
can
t
have
forgotten
it
already
oh
yes
i
have
why
should
i
remember
it
don
t
i
know
poor
euneece
was
in
your
mind
all
the
time
you
re
wrong
again
eunice
was
not
in
my
mind
all
the
time
i
was
hurt
i
was
offended
by
the
cruel
manner
in
which
she
had
treated
me
and
what
was
the
consequence
so
far
was
i
from
deceiving
helena
she
rose
in
my
estimation
by
comparison
with
her
oh
come
come
philip
that
won
t
do
helena
rising
in
anybody
s
estimation
ha
ha
ha
laugh
as
much
as
you
like
miss
jillgall
you
won
t
laugh
away
the
facts
helena
loved
me
helena
was
true
to
me
don
t
be
hard
on
a
poor
fellow
who
is
half
distracted
what
a
man
finds
he
can
do
on
one
day
he
finds
he
can
t
do
on
another
try
to
understand
that
a
change
does
sometimes
come
over
one
s
bless
my
soul
philip
that
s
just
what
i
have
been
understanding
all
the
time
i
know
your
mind
as
well
as
you
know
it
yourself
you
can
t
forget
my
sweet
i
tell
you
i
tried
to
forget
her
on
my
word
of
honor
as
a
gentleman
i
tried
to
forget
her
in
justice
to
helena
is
it
my
fault
that
i
failed
eunice
was
in
my
mind
as
you
said
just
now
oh
my
friend
for
you
are
my
friend
i
am
sure
persuade
her
to
see
me
if
it
s
only
for
a
minute
was
there
ever
a
man
s
mind
in
such
a
state
of
confusion
as
this
first
i
rise
in
his
precious
estimation
and
eunice
drops
then
eunice
rises
and
i
drop
idiot
mischievous
idiot
even
selina
seemed
to
be
disgusted
with
him
when
she
spoke
next
mr
philip
you
are
hard
and
unreasonable
i
have
tried
to
persuade
her
and
i
have
made
my
darling
cry
nothing
you
can
say
will
induce
me
to
distress
her
again
go
back
you
very
undetermined
man
go
back
to
your
too
nonsense
i
say
too
late
if
i
could
have
married
helena
when
i
first
went
to
stay
in
the
house
i
might
have
faced
the
sacrifice
as
it
is
i
can
t
endure
her
and
i
tell
you
this
in
confidence
she
has
herself
to
thank
for
what
has
is
that
really
true
quite
tell
me
what
she
did
oh
don
t
talk
of
her
persuade
eunice
to
see
me
i
shall
come
back
again
and
again
and
again
till
you
bring
her
to
please
don
t
talk
nonsense
if
she
changes
her
mind
i
will
bring
her
with
pleasure
if
she
still
shrinks
from
it
i
regard
euneece
s
feelings
as
sacred
take
my
advice
don
t
press
her
leave
her
time
to
think
of
you
and
to
pity
you
and
that
true
heart
may
be
yours
again
if
you
are
worthy
of
worthy
of
it
what
do
you
mean
are
you
quite
sure
my
young
friend
that
you
won
t
go
back
to
helena
go
back
to
i
would
cut
my
throat
if
i
thought
myself
capable
of
doing
it
how
did
she
set
you
against
her
did
the
wretch
quarrel
with
you
it
might
have
been
better
for
both
of
us
if
she
had
done
that
oh
her
fulsome
endearments
what
a
contrast
to
the
charming
modesty
of
eunice
if
i
was
rich
i
would
make
it
worth
the
while
of
the
first
poor
fellow
i
could
find
to
rid
me
of
helena
by
marrying
her
i
don
t
like
saying
such
a
thing
of
a
woman
but
if
you
will
have
the
truth
well
philip
and
what
is
the
truth
helena
disgusts
chapter
lvii
helena
s
diary
resumed
so
it
was
all
settled
between
them
philip
is
to
throw
me
away
like
one
of
his
bad
cigars
for
this
unanswerable
reason
helena
disgusts
and
he
is
to
persuade
eunice
to
take
my
place
and
be
his
wife
yes
if
i
let
him
do
it
i
heard
no
more
of
their
talk
with
that
last
worst
outrage
burning
in
my
memory
i
left
the
place
on
my
way
back
to
the
carriage
the
dog
met
me
truly
a
grand
creature
i
called
him
by
his
name
and
patted
him
he
licked
my
hand
something
made
me
speak
to
him
i
said
if
i
was
to
tell
you
to
tear
philip
dunboyne
to
pieces
would
you
do
it
the
great
brute
held
out
his
paw
to
shake
hands
well
well
i
was
not
an
object
of
disgust
to
the
dog
but
the
coachman
was
startled
when
he
saw
me
again
he
said
something
i
did
not
know
what
it
was
and
he
produced
a
containing
some
spirits
i
suppose
perhaps
he
thought
i
was
going
to
faint
he
little
knew
me
i
told
him
to
drive
back
to
the
place
at
which
i
had
hired
the
cab
and
earn
his
money
he
earned
it
on
getting
home
i
found
tenbruggen
walking
up
and
down
the
deep
in
thought
she
was
startled
when
we
first
confronted
each
other
you
look
dreadfully
ill
she
said
i
answered
that
i
had
been
out
for
a
little
exercise
and
had
myself
and
then
changed
the
subject
does
my
father
seem
to
improve
under
your
treatment
i
asked
very
far
from
it
my
dear
i
promised
that
i
would
try
what
massage
would
do
for
him
and
i
find
myself
compelled
to
give
it
why
it
excites
him
in
what
way
he
has
been
talking
wildly
of
events
in
his
past
life
his
brain
is
in
some
condition
which
is
beyond
my
powers
of
investigation
he
pointed
to
a
cabinet
in
his
room
and
said
his
past
life
was
locked
up
there
i
asked
if
i
should
unlock
it
he
shook
with
fear
he
said
i
should
let
out
the
ghost
of
his
dead
have
you
any
idea
of
what
he
meant
the
cabinet
was
full
of
old
letters
i
could
tell
her
that
and
could
tell
her
no
more
i
had
never
heard
of
his
another
of
his
delusions
no
doubt
did
you
ever
hear
him
speak
tenbruggen
went
on
of
a
place
called
low
lanes
she
waited
for
my
reply
to
this
last
inquiry
with
an
appearance
of
anxiety
that
surprised
me
i
had
never
heard
him
speak
of
low
lanes
have
you
any
particular
interest
in
the
place
i
asked
none
she
went
away
to
attend
on
a
patient
i
retired
to
my
bedroom
and
opened
my
diary
again
and
again
i
read
that
remarkable
story
of
the
intended
poisoning
and
of
the
manner
in
which
it
had
ended
i
sat
thinking
over
this
romance
in
real
life
till
i
was
interrupted
by
the
announcement
of
dinner
philip
dunboyne
had
returned
in
miss
jillgall
s
absence
we
were
alone
at
the
table
my
appetite
was
gone
i
made
a
pretense
of
eating
and
another
pretense
of
being
glad
to
see
my
devoted
lover
i
talked
to
him
in
the
prettiest
manner
as
a
hypocrite
he
thoroughly
matched
me
he
was
gallant
he
was
amusing
if
baseness
like
ours
had
been
punishable
by
the
law
a
prison
was
the
right
place
for
both
of
us
tenbruggen
came
in
again
after
dinner
still
not
quite
easy
about
my
health
how
flushed
you
are
she
said
let
me
feel
your
i
laughed
and
left
her
with
philip
dunboyne
passing
my
father
s
door
i
looked
in
anxious
to
see
if
he
was
in
the
excitable
state
which
tenbruggen
had
described
yes
the
effect
which
she
had
produced
on
him
how
she
knows
best
had
not
passed
away
yet
he
was
still
talking
the
attendant
told
me
it
had
gone
on
for
hours
together
on
my
approaching
his
chair
he
called
out
which
are
you
eunice
or
helena
when
i
had
answered
him
he
beckoned
me
to
come
nearer
i
am
getting
stronger
every
minute
he
said
we
will
go
traveling
and
see
the
place
where
you
were
where
had
i
been
born
he
had
never
told
me
where
had
he
mentioned
the
place
in
tenbruggen
s
hearing
i
asked
the
attendant
if
he
had
been
present
while
she
was
in
the
room
yes
he
had
remained
at
his
post
he
had
also
heard
the
allusion
to
the
place
with
the
odd
name
had
gracedieu
said
anything
more
about
that
place
nothing
more
the
poor
minister
s
mind
had
wandered
off
to
other
things
he
was
wandering
now
sometimes
he
was
addressing
his
congregation
sometimes
he
wondered
what
they
would
give
him
for
supper
sometimes
he
talked
of
the
flowers
in
the
garden
and
then
he
looked
at
me
and
frowned
and
said
i
prevented
him
from
thinking
i
went
back
to
my
bedroom
and
opened
my
diary
and
read
the
story
again
was
the
poison
of
which
that
resolute
young
wife
proposed
to
make
use
something
that
acted
slowly
and
told
the
doctors
nothing
if
they
looked
for
it
after
death
would
it
be
running
too
great
a
risk
to
show
the
story
to
the
doctor
and
try
to
get
a
little
valuable
information
in
that
way
it
would
be
useless
he
would
make
some
feeble
joke
he
would
say
girls
and
poisons
are
not
fit
company
for
each
other
but
i
might
discover
what
i
want
to
know
in
another
way
i
might
call
on
the
doctor
after
he
has
gone
out
on
his
afternoon
round
of
visits
and
might
tell
the
servant
i
would
wait
for
his
master
s
return
nobody
would
be
in
my
way
i
might
get
at
the
medical
literature
in
the
and
find
the
information
for
myself
a
knock
at
my
door
interrupted
me
in
the
midst
of
my
plans
tenbruggen
again
still
in
a
fidgety
state
of
feeling
on
the
subject
of
my
health
which
is
it
she
said
pain
of
body
my
dear
or
pain
of
mind
i
am
anxious
about
my
dear
elizabeth
your
sympathy
is
thrown
away
on
me
as
i
have
told
you
already
i
am
nothing
she
was
relieved
to
hear
that
i
had
no
mental
troubles
to
complain
of
fatigue
she
remarked
sets
itself
right
with
rest
did
you
take
a
very
long
walk
beyond
the
limits
of
the
town
of
course
philip
has
been
taking
a
walk
in
the
country
too
he
doesn
t
say
that
he
met
these
clever
people
sometimes
overreach
themselves
how
she
suggested
it
to
me
i
can
not
pretend
to
have
discovered
but
i
did
certainly
suspect
that
she
had
led
philip
while
they
were
together
downstairs
into
saying
to
her
what
he
had
already
said
to
miss
jillgall
i
was
so
angry
that
i
tried
to
pump
my
excellent
friend
as
she
had
been
trying
to
pump
me
a
vulgar
expression
but
vulgar
writing
is
such
a
convenient
way
of
writing
sometimes
my
first
attempt
to
entrap
the
masseuse
failed
completely
she
coolly
changed
the
subject
have
i
interrupted
you
in
writing
she
asked
pointing
to
my
diary
no
i
was
idling
over
what
i
have
written
already
an
extraordinary
story
which
i
copied
from
a
may
i
look
at
it
i
pushed
the
open
diary
across
the
table
if
i
was
the
object
of
any
suspicions
which
she
wanted
to
confirm
it
would
be
curious
to
see
if
the
poisoning
story
helped
her
it
s
a
piece
of
family
history
i
said
i
think
you
will
agree
with
me
that
it
is
really
she
began
to
read
as
she
went
on
not
all
her
power
of
controlling
herself
could
prevent
her
from
turning
pale
this
change
of
color
in
such
a
woman
a
little
alarmed
me
when
a
girl
is
devoured
by
deadly
hatred
of
a
man
does
the
feeling
show
itself
to
other
persons
in
her
face
i
must
practice
before
the
glass
and
train
my
face
into
a
trustworthy
state
of
discipline
coarse
melodrama
tenbruggen
declared
mere
sensation
no
analysis
of
character
a
story
well
made
up
surely
i
answered
i
don
t
agree
with
her
voice
was
not
quite
so
steady
as
usual
she
asked
suddenly
if
my
clock
was
right
and
declared
that
she
should
be
late
for
an
appointment
on
taking
leave
she
pressed
my
hand
strongly
eyed
me
with
distrustful
attention
and
said
very
emphatically
take
care
of
yourself
helena
pray
take
care
of
i
am
afraid
i
did
a
very
foolish
thing
when
i
showed
her
the
poisoning
story
has
it
helped
the
wily
old
creature
to
look
into
my
inmost
thoughts
impossible
miss
jillgall
returned
looking
hideously
healthy
and
spitefully
cheerful
although
she
tried
to
conceal
it
while
i
was
present
i
could
see
that
philip
had
recovered
his
place
in
her
favor
after
what
he
had
said
to
her
behind
the
hedge
at
the
farm
she
would
be
relieved
from
all
fear
of
my
becoming
his
wife
and
would
joyfully
anticipate
his
marriage
to
eunice
there
are
thoughts
in
me
which
i
don
t
set
down
in
my
book
i
only
say
we
shall
see
this
afternoon
i
decided
on
visiting
the
doctor
the
servant
was
quite
sorry
for
me
when
he
answered
the
door
his
master
had
just
left
the
house
for
a
round
of
visits
i
said
i
would
wait
the
servant
was
afraid
i
should
find
waiting
very
tedious
i
reminded
him
that
i
could
go
away
if
i
found
it
tedious
at
last
the
polite
old
man
left
me
i
went
into
the
and
read
the
backs
of
the
medical
books
ranged
round
the
walls
and
found
a
volume
that
interested
me
there
was
such
curious
information
in
it
that
i
amused
myself
by
making
extracts
using
the
first
sheets
of
paper
that
i
could
find
they
had
printed
directions
at
the
top
which
showed
that
the
doctor
was
accustomed
to
write
his
prescriptions
on
them
we
had
many
too
many
of
his
prescriptions
in
our
house
the
servant
s
doubts
of
my
patience
proved
to
have
been
well
founded
i
got
tired
of
waiting
and
went
home
before
the
doctor
returned
from
morning
to
night
nothing
has
been
seen
of
tenbruggen
nor
has
any
apology
for
her
neglect
of
us
been
received
fond
as
she
is
of
writing
little
notes
has
that
story
in
my
diary
driven
her
away
let
me
see
what
may
bring
forth
has
brought
forth
nothing
tenbruggen
still
keeps
away
from
us
it
looks
as
if
my
diary
had
something
to
do
with
the
mystery
of
her
absence
i
am
not
in
good
spirits
my
nerves
if
i
have
such
things
which
is
more
than
i
know
by
my
own
experience
have
been
a
little
shaken
by
a
horrid
dream
the
medical
information
which
my
thirst
for
knowledge
absorbed
in
the
doctor
s
turned
traitor
armed
itself
with
the
grotesque
horrors
of
nightmare
and
so
thoroughly
frightened
me
that
i
was
on
the
point
of
being
foolish
enough
to
destroy
my
notes
i
thought
better
of
it
and
my
notes
are
safe
under
lock
and
key
philip
dunboyne
is
trying
to
pave
the
way
for
his
flight
from
this
house
he
speaks
of
friends
in
london
whose
interest
will
help
him
to
find
the
employment
which
is
the
object
of
his
ambition
in
a
few
days
more
he
said
i
shall
ask
for
leave
of
instead
of
looking
at
me
his
eyes
wandered
to
the
window
his
fingers
played
restlessly
with
his
while
he
spoke
i
thought
i
would
give
him
a
chance
a
last
chance
of
making
the
atonement
that
he
owes
to
me
this
shows
shameful
weakness
on
my
part
does
my
own
resolution
startle
me
or
does
the
wretch
appeal
to
what
to
my
pity
it
can
not
be
my
love
i
am
positively
sure
that
i
hate
him
well
i
am
not
the
first
girl
who
had
been
an
unanswerable
riddle
to
herself
is
there
any
other
motive
for
your
departure
i
asked
what
other
motive
can
there
be
he
replied
i
put
what
i
had
to
say
to
him
in
plainer
words
still
tell
me
philip
are
you
beginning
to
wish
that
you
were
a
free
man
again
he
still
prevaricated
was
this
because
he
is
afraid
of
me
or
because
he
is
not
quite
brute
enough
to
insult
me
to
my
face
i
tried
again
for
the
third
and
last
time
i
almost
put
the
words
into
his
mouth
i
fancy
you
have
been
out
of
temper
lately
i
said
you
have
not
been
your
own
kinder
and
better
self
is
this
the
right
interpretation
of
the
change
that
i
think
i
see
in
you
he
answered
i
have
not
been
very
well
and
that
is
all
yes
that
is
there
was
no
more
to
be
said
i
turned
away
to
leave
the
room
he
followed
me
to
the
door
after
a
momentary
hesitation
he
made
the
attempt
to
kiss
me
i
only
looked
at
him
he
drew
back
from
me
in
silence
i
left
the
new
judas
standing
alone
while
the
shades
of
evening
began
to
gather
over
the
room

if
anything
of
importance
happens
i
trust
to
you
to
write
an
account
of
it
and
to
send
the
writing
to
me
i
will
come
to
you
at

i
see

to
believe
that

dear
mr
governor

which
has
always
been
one
of
the
strong
points
in
my
character
every
suspicious
circumstance
which
occurs
in

will
be

on
by
my

and
will
find
itself

placed
on
its
trial
before
your
unerring
judgment
let
the
wicked
tremble
i
mention
no
names
taking
up
my
narrative
where
it
came
to
an
end
when
i
last
wrote
i
have
to
say
a
word
first
on
the
subject
of
my
discoveries
in
regard
to
philip
s
movements
the
advertisement
of
a
private
inquiry
office
which
i
read
in
a
newspaper
put
the
thing
into
my
head
i
provided
myself
with
money
to
pay
the
expenses
by
i
blush
while
i
write
it
pawning
my
watch
this
humiliation
of
my
poor
self
has
been
rewarded
by
success
skilled
investigation
has
proved
that
our
young
man
has
come
to
his
senses
again
exactly
as
i
supposed
on
each
occasion
when
he
was
suspiciously
absent
from
the
house
he
has
been
followed
to
the
farm
i
have
been
staying
there
myself
for
a
day
or
two
in
the
hope
of
persuading
eunice
to
relent
the
hope
has
not
yet
been
realized
but
philip
s
devotion
assisted
by
my
influence
will
yet
prevail
let
me
not
despair
whether
helena
knows
positively
that
she
has
lost
her
wicked
hold
on
philip
i
can
not
say
it
seems
hardly
possible
that
she
could
have
made
the
discovery
just
yet
the
one
thing
of
which
i
am
certain
is
that
she
looks
like
a
fiend
philip
has
wisely
taken
my
advice
and
employed
pious
fraud
he
will
get
away
from
the
wretch
who
has
tempted
him
once
and
may
tempt
him
again
under
pretense
of
using
the
interest
of
his
friends
in
london
to
find
a
place
under
government
he
has
not
been
very
well
for
the
last
day
or
two
and
the
execution
of
our
project
is
in
consequence
delayed
i
have
news
of
tenbruggen
which
will
i
think
surprise
you
she
has
kept
away
from
us
in
a
most
unaccountable
manner
i
called
on
her
at
the
hotel
and
heard
she
was
engaged
with
her
lawyer
on
the
next
day
she
suddenly
returned
to
her
old
habits
and
paid
the
customary
visit
i
observed
a
similar
alteration
in
her
state
of
feeling
she
is
now
coldly
civil
to
helena
and
she
asks
after
eunice
with
a
maternal
interest
touching
to
see
i
said
to
her
elizabeth
you
appear
to
have
changed
your
opinion
of
the
two
girls
since
i
saw
she
answered
with
a
delightful
candor
which
reminded
me
of
old
times
completely
i
said
a
woman
of
your
intellectual
caliber
dear
doesn
t
change
her
mind
without
a
good
reason
for
elizabeth
cordially
agreed
with
me
i
ventured
to
be
a
little
more
explicit
you
have
no
doubt
made
some
interesting
elizabeth
agreed
again
and
i
ventured
again
i
suppose
i
may
not
ask
what
the
discovery
is
no
selina
you
may
not
this
is
curious
but
it
is
nothing
to
what
i
have
got
to
tell
you
next
just
as
i
was
longing
to
take
her
to
my
bosom
again
as
my
friend
and
confidante
elizabeth
has
disappeared
and
alas
alas
there
is
a
reason
for
it
which
no
sympathetic
person
can
dispute
i
have
just
received
some
overwhelming
news
in
the
form
of
a
neat
parcel
addressed
to
myself
there
has
been
a
scandal
at
the
hotel
that
monster
in
human
form
elizabeth
s
husband
is
aware
of
his
wife
s
professional
fame
has
heard
of
the
large
sums
of
money
which
she
earns
as
the
greatest
living
professor
of
massage
has
been
long
on
the
lookout
for
her
and
has
discovered
her
at
last
he
has
not
only
forced
his
way
into
her
at
the
hotel
he
insists
on
her
living
with
him
again
her
money
being
the
attraction
it
is
needless
to
say
if
she
refuses
he
threatens
her
with
the
law
the
barbarous
law
which
to
use
his
own
coarse
expression
will
restore
his
conjugal
all
this
i
gather
from
the
narrative
of
my
unhappy
friend
which
forms
one
of
the
two
inclosures
in
her
parcel
she
has
already
made
her
escape
ha
the
man
doesn
t
live
who
can
circumvent
elizabeth
the
english
court
of
law
isn
t
built
which
can
catch
her
when
she
roams
the
free
and
glorious
continent
the
vastness
of
this
amazing
woman
s
mind
is
what
i
must
pause
to
admire
in
the
frightful
catastrophe
that
has
befallen
her
she
can
still
think
of
philip
and
euneece
she
is
eager
to
hear
of
their
marriage
and
renounces
helena
with
her
whole
heart
i
too
was
deceived
by
that
cunning
young
woman
she
writes
beware
of
her
selina
unless
i
am
much
mistaken
she
is
going
to
end
badly
take
care
of
philip
take
care
of
euneece
if
you
want
help
apply
at
once
to
my
favorite
hero
in
real
life
the
i
don
t
presume
to
correct
elizabeth
s
language
i
should
have
called
you
the
idol
of
the
women
the
second
inclosure
contains
as
i
suppose
a
wedding
present
it
is
carefully
sealed
it
feels
no
bigger
than
an
ordinary
letter
and
it
contains
an
inscription
which
your
intelligence
may
be
able
to
explain
i
copy
it
as
follows
to
be
inclosed
in
another
envelope
addressed
to
dunboyne
the
elder
at
percy
s
private
hotel
london
and
delivered
by
a
trustworthy
messenger
on
the
day
when
philip
dunboyne
is
married
to
miss
eunice
gracedieu
placed
meanwhile
under
the
care
of
miss
selina
why
is
this
mysterious
letter
to
be
sent
to
philip
s
father
i
wonder
whether
that
circumstance
will
puzzle
you
as
it
has
puzzled
me
i
have
kept
my
report
back
so
as
to
send
you
the
last
news
relating
to
philip
s
state
of
health
to
my
great
regret
his
illness
seems
to
have
made
a
serious
advance
since
yesterday
when
i
ask
if
he
is
in
pain
he
says
it
isn
t
exactly
pain
i
feel
as
if
i
was
sinking
sometimes
i
am
giddy
and
sometimes
i
find
myself
feeling
thirsty
and
i
have
no
opportunity
of
looking
after
him
as
i
could
wish
for
helena
insists
on
nursing
him
assisted
by
the
housemaid
maria
is
a
very
good
girl
in
her
way
but
too
stupid
to
be
of
much
use
if
he
is
not
better
i
shall
insist
on
sending
for
the
doctor
he
is
no
better
and
he
wishes
to
have
medical
help
helena
doesn
t
seem
to
understand
his
illness
it
was
not
until
philip
had
insisted
on
seeing
him
that
she
consented
to
send
for
the
doctor
you
had
some
talk
with
this
experienced
physician
when
you
were
here
and
you
know
what
a
clever
man
he
is
when
i
tell
you
that
he
hesitates
to
say
what
is
the
matter
with
philip
you
will
feel
as
much
alarmed
as
i
do
i
will
wait
to
send
this
to
the
post
until
i
can
write
in
a
more
definite
way
two
days
more
have
passed
the
doctor
has
put
two
very
strange
questions
to
me
he
asked
first
if
there
was
anybody
staying
with
us
besides
the
regular
members
of
the
household
i
said
we
had
no
visitor
he
wanted
to
know
next
if
philip
dunboyne
had
made
any
enemies
since
he
has
been
living
in
our
town
i
said
none
that
i
knew
of
and
i
took
the
liberty
of
asking
what
he
meant
he
answered
to
this
that
he
has
a
few
more
inquiries
to
make
and
that
he
will
tell
me
what
he
means
for
god
s
sake
come
here
as
soon
as
you
possibly
can
the
whole
burden
is
thrown
on
me
and
i
am
quite
unequal
to
it
i
received
the
doctor
in
the
to
my
amazement
he
begged
leave
to
speak
with
me
in
the
garden
when
i
asked
why
he
answered
i
don
t
want
to
have
a
listener
at
the
door
come
out
on
the
lawn
where
we
can
be
sure
that
we
are
when
we
were
in
the
garden
he
noticed
that
i
was
trembling
rouse
your
courage
miss
jillgall
he
said
in
the
minister
s
helpless
state
there
is
nobody
whom
i
can
speak
to
but
i
ventured
to
remind
him
that
he
might
speak
to
helena
as
well
as
to
myself
he
looked
as
black
as
thunder
when
i
mentioned
her
name
all
he
said
was
no
but
oh
if
you
had
heard
his
voice
and
he
so
gentle
and
at
other
times
you
would
have
felt
as
i
did
that
he
had
helena
in
his
mind
now
listen
to
this
he
went
on
everything
that
my
art
can
do
for
philip
dunboyne
while
i
am
at
his
bedside
is
undone
while
i
am
away
by
some
other
person
he
is
worse
than
i
have
seen
him
oh
sir
do
you
think
he
will
die
he
will
certainly
die
unless
the
right
means
are
taken
to
save
him
and
taken
at
once
it
is
my
duty
not
to
flinch
from
telling
you
the
truth
i
have
made
a
discovery
since
yesterday
which
satisfies
me
that
i
am
right
somebody
is
trying
to
poison
dunboyne
and
somebody
will
succeed
unless
he
is
removed
from
this
i
am
a
poor
feeble
creature
the
doctor
caught
me
or
i
should
have
dropped
on
the
grass
it
was
not
a
i
only
shook
and
shivered
so
that
i
was
too
weak
to
stand
up
encouraged
by
the
doctor
i
recovered
sufficiently
to
be
able
to
ask
him
where
philip
was
to
be
taken
to
he
said
to
the
hospital
no
poisoner
can
follow
my
patient
there
persuade
him
to
let
me
take
him
away
when
i
call
again
in
an
hour
s
as
soon
as
i
could
hold
a
pen
i
sent
a
telegram
to
you
pray
pray
come
by
the
earliest
train
i
also
telegraphed
to
old
dunboyne
at
the
hotel
in
london
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
face
helena
i
own
i
was
afraid
the
cook
kindly
went
upstairs
to
see
who
was
in
philip
s
room
it
was
the
housemaid
s
turn
to
look
after
him
for
a
while
i
went
instantly
to
his
bedside
there
was
no
persuading
him
to
allow
himself
to
be
taken
to
the
hospital
i
am
dying
he
said
if
you
have
any
pity
for
me
send
for
euneece
let
me
see
her
once
more
let
me
hear
her
say
that
she
forgives
me
before
i
i
hesitated
it
was
too
terrible
to
think
of
euneece
in
the
same
house
with
her
sister
her
life
might
be
in
danger
philip
gave
me
a
look
a
dreadful
ghastly
look
if
you
refuse
he
said
wildly
the
grave
won
t
hold
me
i
ll
haunt
you
for
the
rest
of
your
she
shall
hear
that
you
are
ill
i
answered
and
ran
out
of
the
room
before
he
could
speak
again
what
i
had
promised
to
write
i
did
write
but
placed
between
euneece
s
danger
and
philip
s
danger
my
heart
was
all
for
euneece
would
helena
spare
her
if
she
came
to
philip
s
bedside
in
such
terror
as
i
never
felt
before
in
my
life
i
added
a
word
more
entreating
her
not
to
leave
the
farm
i
promised
to
keep
her
regularly
informed
on
the
subject
of
philip
s
illness
and
i
mentioned
that
i
expected
the
governor
to
return
to
us
immediately
do
nothing
i
wrote
without
his
my
letter
having
been
completed
i
sent
the
cook
away
with
it
in
a
chaise
she
belonged
to
the
neighborhood
and
she
knew
the
farmhouse
well
nearly
two
hours
afterward
i
heard
the
chaise
stop
at
the
door
and
ran
out
impatient
to
hear
how
my
sweet
girl
had
received
my
letter
god
help
us
all
when
i
opened
the
door
the
first
person
whom
i
saw
was
euneece
herself
chapter
lix
defense
one
surprise
followed
another
after
i
had
encountered
euneece
at
the
door
when
my
fondness
had
excused
her
for
setting
the
advice
in
my
letter
at
defiance
i
was
conscious
of
expecting
to
see
her
in
tears
eager
distressingly
eager
to
hear
what
hope
there
might
be
of
philip
s
recovery
i
saw
no
tears
i
heard
no
inquiries
she
was
pale
and
quiet
and
silent
not
a
word
fell
from
her
when
we
met
not
a
word
when
she
kissed
me
not
a
word
when
she
led
the
way
into
the
nearest
room
the
it
was
only
when
we
were
shut
in
together
that
she
spoke
which
is
philip
s
room
she
asked
instead
of
wanting
to
know
how
he
was
she
desired
to
know
where
he
was
i
pointed
toward
the
back
which
had
been
made
into
a
bedroom
for
philip
he
had
chosen
it
himself
when
he
first
came
to
stay
with
us
because
the
window
opened
into
the
garden
and
he
could
slip
out
and
smoke
at
any
hour
of
the
day
or
night
when
he
pleased
who
is
with
him
now
was
the
next
strange
thing
this
girl
said
to
me
maria
is
taking
her
turn
i
answered
she
assists
in
nursing
where
is
euneece
got
no
further
than
that
her
breath
quickened
her
color
faded
away
i
had
seen
people
look
as
she
was
looking
now
when
they
suffered
under
some
sudden
pain
before
i
could
offer
to
help
her
she
rallied
and
went
on
where
she
began
again
is
the
other
nurse
you
mean
helena
i
said
i
mean
the
when
i
remind
you
dear
mr
governor
that
my
letter
had
carefully
concealed
from
her
the
horrible
discovery
made
by
the
doctor
your
imagination
will
picture
my
state
of
mind
she
saw
that
i
was
overpowered
her
sweet
nature
so
strangely
frozen
up
thus
far
melted
at
last
you
don
t
know
what
i
have
heard
she
said
you
don
t
know
what
thoughts
have
been
roused
in
she
left
her
chair
and
sat
on
my
knee
with
the
familiarity
of
the
dear
old
times
and
took
the
letter
that
i
had
written
to
her
from
her
pocket
look
at
it
yourself
she
said
and
tell
me
if
anybody
could
read
it
and
not
see
that
you
were
concealing
something
my
dear
i
have
driven
round
by
the
doctor
s
house
i
have
seen
him
i
have
persuaded
him
or
perhaps
i
ought
to
say
surprised
him
into
telling
me
the
truth
but
the
kind
old
man
is
obstinate
he
wouldn
t
believe
me
when
i
told
him
i
was
on
my
way
here
to
save
philip
s
life
he
said
my
child
you
will
only
put
your
own
life
in
jeopardy
if
i
had
not
seen
that
danger
i
should
never
have
told
you
of
the
dreadful
state
of
things
at
home
go
back
to
the
good
people
at
the
farm
and
leave
the
saving
of
philip
to
he
was
right
euneece
entirely
no
dear
he
was
wrong
i
begged
him
to
come
here
and
judge
for
himself
and
i
ask
you
to
do
the
i
was
obstinate
go
back
i
persisted
go
back
to
the
farm
can
i
see
philip
she
asked
i
have
heard
some
insolent
men
say
that
women
are
like
cats
if
they
mean
that
we
do
figuratively
speaking
scratch
at
times
i
am
afraid
they
are
not
altogether
wrong
an
irresistible
impulse
made
me
say
to
poor
euneece
this
is
a
change
indeed
since
you
refused
to
receive
is
there
no
change
in
the
circumstances
she
asked
sadly
isn
t
he
ill
and
in
danger
i
begged
her
to
forgive
me
i
said
i
meant
no
harm
i
gave
him
up
to
my
sister
she
continued
when
i
believed
that
his
happiness
depended
not
on
me
but
on
her
i
take
him
back
to
myself
when
he
is
at
the
mercy
of
a
demon
who
threatens
his
life
come
selina
let
us
go
to
she
put
her
arm
round
me
and
made
me
get
up
from
my
chair
i
was
so
easily
persuaded
by
her
that
the
fear
of
what
helena
s
jealousy
and
helena
s
anger
might
do
was
scarcely
present
in
my
thoughts
the
door
of
communication
was
locked
on
the
side
of
the
bedchamber
i
went
into
the
hall
to
enter
philip
s
room
by
the
other
door
she
followed
waiting
behind
me
i
heard
what
passed
between
them
when
maria
went
out
to
her
where
is
miss
gracedieu
resting
upstairs
miss
in
her
look
at
the
clock
and
tell
me
when
you
expect
her
to
come
down
i
am
to
call
her
miss
in
ten
minutes
wait
in
the
maria
till
i
come
back
to
she
joined
me
i
held
the
door
open
for
her
to
go
into
philip
s
room
it
was
not
out
of
curiosity
the
feeling
that
urged
me
was
sympathy
when
i
waited
a
moment
to
see
their
first
meeting
she
bent
over
the
poor
pallid
trembling
suffering
man
and
raised
him
in
her
arms
and
laid
his
head
on
her
bosom
my
philip
she
murmured
those
words
in
a
kiss
i
closed
the
door
i
had
a
good
cry
and
oh
how
it
comforted
me
there
was
only
a
minute
to
spare
when
she
came
out
of
the
room
maria
was
waiting
for
her
euneece
said
as
quietly
as
ever
go
and
call
miss
the
girl
looked
at
her
and
saw
i
don
t
know
what
maria
became
alarmed
but
she
went
up
the
stairs
and
returned
in
haste
to
tell
us
that
her
young
mistress
was
coming
down
the
faint
rustling
of
helena
s
dress
as
she
left
her
room
reached
us
in
the
silence
i
remained
at
the
open
door
of
the
and
maria
approached
and
stood
near
me
we
were
both
frightened
euneece
stepped
forward
and
stood
on
the
mat
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
waiting
her
back
was
toward
me
i
could
only
see
that
she
was
as
still
as
a
statue
the
rustling
of
the
dress
came
nearer
oh
heavens
what
was
going
to
happen
my
teeth
chattered
in
my
head
i
held
by
maria
s
shoulder
drops
of
perspiration
showed
themselves
on
the
girl
s
forehead
she
stared
in
vacant
terror
at
the
slim
little
figure
posted
firm
and
still
on
the
mat
helena
turned
the
corner
of
the
stairs
and
waited
a
moment
on
the
last
landing
and
saw
her
sister
you
here
she
said
what
do
you
want
there
was
no
reply
helena
descended
until
she
reached
the
last
stair
but
one
there
she
stopped
her
staring
eyes
grew
large
and
wild
her
hand
shook
as
she
stretched
it
out
feeling
for
the
banister
she
staggered
as
she
caught
at
it
and
held
herself
up
the
silence
was
still
unbroken
something
in
me
stronger
than
myself
drew
my
steps
along
the
hall
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
stair
till
i
could
see
the
face
which
had
struck
that
murderous
wretch
with
terror
i
looked
no
it
was
not
my
sweet
girl
it
was
a
horrid
transformation
of
her
i
saw
a
fearful
creature
with
glittering
eyes
that
threatened
some
unimaginable
vengeance
her
lips
were
drawn
back
they
showed
her
clinched
teeth
a
burning
red
flush
dyed
her
face
the
hair
of
her
head
rose
little
by
little
slowly
and
most
dreadful
sight
of
all
she
seemed
in
the
stillness
of
the
house
to
be
to
if
i
could
have
moved
i
should
have
fled
to
the
first
place
of
refuge
i
could
find
if
i
could
have
raised
my
voice
i
should
have
cried
for
help
i
could
do
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
i
could
only
look
look
look
held
by
the
horror
of
it
with
a
hand
of
iron
helena
must
have
roused
her
courage
and
resisted
her
terror
i
heard
her
speak
let
me
by
slowly
steadily
in
a
whisper
euneece
made
that
reply
helena
tried
once
more
still
fighting
against
her
own
terror
i
knew
it
by
the
trembling
of
her
voice
let
me
by
she
repeated
i
am
on
my
way
to
philip
s
you
will
never
enter
philip
s
room
who
will
stop
me
i
she
had
spoken
in
the
same
steady
whisper
throughout
but
now
she
moved
i
saw
her
set
her
foot
on
the
first
stair
i
saw
the
horrid
glitter
in
her
eyes
flash
close
into
helena
s
face
i
heard
her
say
poisoner
go
back
to
your
silent
and
shuddering
helena
shrank
away
from
her
daunted
by
her
glittering
eyes
mastered
by
her
lifted
hand
pointing
up
the
stairs
helena
slowly
ascended
till
she
reached
the
landing
she
turned
and
looked
down
she
tried
to
speak
the
pointing
hand
struck
her
dumb
and
drove
her
up
the
next
flight
of
stairs
she
was
lost
to
view
only
the
small
rustling
sound
of
the
dress
was
to
be
heard
growing
fainter
and
fainter
then
an
interval
of
stillness
then
the
noise
of
a
door
opened
and
closed
again
then
no
sound
more
but
a
change
to
be
seen
the
transformed
creature
was
crouching
on
her
knees
still
and
silent
her
face
covered
by
her
hands
i
was
afraid
to
approach
her
i
was
afraid
to
speak
to
her
after
a
time
she
rose
suddenly
swiftly
with
her
head
turned
away
from
me
she
opened
the
door
of
philip
s
room
and
was
gone
i
looked
round
there
was
only
maria
in
the
lonely
hall
shall
i
try
to
tell
you
what
my
sensations
were
it
may
sound
strangely
but
it
is
true
i
felt
like
a
sleeper
who
has
from
a
dream
chapter
lx
discovery
a
little
later
on
that
eventful
day
when
i
was
most
in
need
of
all
that
your
wisdom
and
kindness
could
do
to
guide
me
came
the
telegram
which
announced
that
you
were
helpless
under
an
attack
of
gout
as
soon
as
i
had
in
some
degree
got
over
my
disappointment
i
remembered
having
told
euneece
in
my
letter
that
i
expected
her
kind
old
friend
to
come
to
us
with
the
telegram
in
my
hand
i
knocked
softly
at
philip
s
door
the
voice
that
bade
me
come
in
was
the
gentle
voice
that
i
knew
so
well
philip
was
sleeping
there
by
his
bedside
with
his
hand
resting
in
her
hand
was
euneece
so
completely
restored
to
her
own
sweet
self
that
i
could
hardly
believe
what
i
had
seen
not
an
hour
since
she
talked
of
you
when
i
showed
her
your
message
with
affectionate
interest
and
regret
look
back
my
admirable
friend
at
what
i
have
written
on
the
two
or
three
pages
which
precede
this
and
explain
the
astounding
contrast
if
you
can
i
was
left
alone
to
watch
by
philip
while
euneece
went
away
to
see
her
father
soon
afterward
maria
took
my
place
i
had
been
sent
for
to
the
next
room
to
receive
the
doctor
he
looked
and
grieved
i
said
i
was
afraid
he
had
brought
bad
news
with
him
the
worst
possible
news
he
answered
a
terrible
exposure
threatens
this
family
and
i
am
powerless
to
prevent
he
then
asked
me
to
remember
the
day
when
i
had
been
surprised
by
the
singular
questions
which
he
had
put
to
me
and
when
he
had
engaged
to
explain
himself
after
he
had
made
some
inquiries
why
and
how
he
had
set
those
inquiries
on
foot
was
what
he
had
now
to
tell
i
will
repeat
what
he
said
in
his
own
words
as
nearly
as
i
can
remember
them
while
he
was
in
attendance
on
philip
he
had
observed
symptoms
which
made
him
suspect
that
digitalis
had
been
given
to
the
young
man
in
doses
often
repeated
cases
of
attempted
poisoning
by
this
medicine
were
so
rare
that
he
felt
bound
to
put
his
suspicions
to
the
test
by
going
round
among
the
chemists
s
shops
excepting
of
course
the
shop
at
which
his
own
prescriptions
were
made
up
and
asking
if
they
had
lately
dispensed
any
preparation
of
digitalis
ordered
perhaps
in
a
larger
quantity
than
usual
at
the
second
shop
he
visited
the
chemist
laughed
why
doctor
he
said
have
you
forgotten
your
own
prescription
after
this
the
prescription
was
asked
for
and
produced
it
was
on
the
paper
used
by
the
doctor
paper
which
had
his
address
printed
at
the
top
and
a
notice
added
telling
patients
who
came
to
consult
him
for
the
second
time
to
bring
their
prescriptions
with
them
then
there
followed
in
writing
tincture
of
digitalis
one
ounce
with
his
signature
at
the
end
not
badly
imitated
but
a
forgery
nevertheless
the
chemist
noticed
the
effect
which
this
discovery
had
produced
on
the
doctor
and
asked
if
that
was
his
signature
he
could
hardly
as
an
honest
man
have
asserted
that
a
forgery
was
a
signature
of
his
own
writing
so
he
made
the
true
reply
and
asked
who
had
presented
the
prescription
the
chemist
called
to
his
assistant
to
come
forward
did
you
tell
me
that
you
knew
by
sight
the
young
lady
who
brought
this
prescription
the
assistant
admitted
it
did
you
tell
me
she
was
miss
helena
gracedieu
i
are
you
sure
of
not
having
made
any
mistake
quite
the
chemist
then
said
i
myself
supplied
the
tincture
of
digitalis
and
the
young
lady
paid
for
it
and
took
it
away
with
her
you
have
had
all
the
information
that
i
can
give
you
sir
and
i
may
now
ask
if
you
can
throw
any
light
on
the
our
good
friend
thought
of
the
poor
minister
so
sorely
afflicted
and
of
the
famous
name
so
sincerely
respected
in
the
town
and
in
the
country
round
and
said
he
could
not
undertake
to
give
an
immediate
answer
the
chemist
was
excessively
angry
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
he
said
that
digitalis
given
in
certain
doses
is
a
poison
and
you
can
not
deny
that
i
honestly
believed
myself
to
be
dispensing
your
prescription
while
you
are
hesitating
to
give
me
an
answer
my
character
may
suffer
i
may
be
suspected
he
ended
in
declaring
he
should
consult
his
lawyer
the
doctor
went
home
and
questioned
his
servant
the
man
remembered
the
day
of
miss
helena
s
visit
in
the
afternoon
and
the
intention
that
she
expressed
of
waiting
for
his
master
s
return
he
had
shown
her
into
the
parlor
which
opened
into
the
no
other
visitor
was
in
the
house
at
that
time
or
had
arrived
during
the
rest
of
the
day
the
doctor
s
own
experience
when
he
got
home
led
him
to
conclude
that
helena
had
gone
into
the
he
had
entered
that
room
for
the
purpose
of
writing
some
prescriptions
and
had
found
the
leaves
of
paper
that
he
used
diminished
in
number
after
what
he
had
heard
and
what
he
had
discovered
to
say
nothing
of
what
he
suspected
it
occurred
to
him
to
look
along
the
shelves
of
his
medical
library
he
found
a
volume
treating
of
poisons
with
a
slip
of
paper
left
between
the
leaves
the
poison
described
at
the
place
so
marked
being
digitalis
and
the
paper
used
being
one
of
his
own
if
as
i
fear
a
legal
investigation
into
helena
s
conduct
is
a
possible
event
the
doctor
concluded
there
is
the
evidence
that
i
shall
be
obliged
to
give
when
i
am
called
as
a
it
is
my
belief
that
i
could
have
felt
no
greater
dismay
if
the
long
arm
of
the
law
had
laid
its
hold
on
me
while
he
was
speaking
i
asked
what
was
to
be
done
if
she
leaves
the
house
at
once
the
doctor
replied
she
may
escape
the
infamy
of
being
charged
with
an
attempt
at
murder
by
poison
and
in
her
absence
i
can
answer
for
philip
s
life
i
don
t
urge
you
to
warn
her
because
that
might
be
a
dangerous
thing
to
do
it
is
for
you
to
decide
as
a
member
of
the
family
whether
you
will
run
the
i
tried
to
speak
to
him
of
euneece
and
to
tell
him
what
i
had
already
related
to
yourself
he
was
in
no
humor
to
listen
to
me
keep
it
for
a
fitter
time
he
answered
and
think
of
what
i
have
just
said
to
with
that
he
left
me
on
his
way
to
philip
s
room
mental
exertion
was
completely
beyond
me
can
you
understand
a
poor
spinster
being
frightened
into
doing
a
dangerous
thing
that
may
seem
to
be
nonsense
but
if
you
ask
why
i
took
a
morsel
of
paper
and
wrote
the
warning
which
i
was
afraid
to
communicate
by
word
of
mouth
why
i
went
upstairs
with
my
knees
knocking
together
and
opened
the
door
of
helena
s
room
just
wide
enough
to
let
my
hand
pass
through
why
i
threw
the
paper
in
and
banged
the
door
to
again
and
ran
downstairs
as
i
have
never
run
since
i
was
a
little
girl
i
can
only
say
in
the
way
of
explanation
what
i
have
said
already
i
was
frightened
into
doing
it
what
i
have
written
thus
far
i
shall
send
to
you
by
s
post
the
doctor
came
back
to
me
after
he
had
seen
philip
and
spoken
with
euneece
he
was
very
angry
and
i
must
own
not
without
reason
philip
had
flatly
refused
to
let
himself
be
removed
to
the
hospital
and
euneece
a
mere
girl
had
declared
that
she
would
be
answerable
for
consequences
the
doctor
warned
me
that
he
meant
to
withdraw
from
the
case
and
to
make
his
declaration
before
the
magistrates
at
my
entreaties
he
consented
to
return
in
the
evening
and
to
judge
by
results
before
taking
the
terrible
step
that
he
had
threatened
while
i
remained
at
home
on
the
watch
keeping
the
doors
of
both
rooms
locked
eunice
went
out
to
get
philip
s
medicine
she
came
back
followed
by
a
boy
carrying
a
portable
apparatus
for
cooking
all
that
philip
wants
and
all
that
we
want
she
explained
we
can
provide
for
ourselves
give
me
a
morsel
of
paper
to
write
unhooking
the
little
pencil
attached
to
her
she
paused
and
looked
toward
the
door
somebody
listening
she
whispered
let
them
she
wrote
a
list
of
necessaries
in
the
way
of
things
to
eat
and
things
to
drink
and
asked
me
to
go
out
and
get
them
myself
i
don
t
doubt
the
servants
she
said
speaking
distinctly
enough
to
be
heard
outside
but
i
am
afraid
of
what
a
poisoner
s
cunning
and
a
poisoner
s
desperation
may
do
in
a
kitchen
which
is
open
to
i
went
away
on
my
errand
discovering
no
listener
outside
i
need
hardly
say
on
my
return
i
found
the
door
of
communication
with
philip
s
room
closed
but
no
longer
locked
we
can
now
attend
on
him
in
turn
she
said
without
opening
either
of
the
doors
which
lead
into
the
hall
at
night
we
can
relieve
each
other
and
each
of
us
can
get
sleep
as
we
want
it
in
the
large
armchair
in
the
philip
must
be
safe
under
our
charge
or
the
doctor
will
insist
on
taking
him
to
the
hospital
when
we
want
maria
s
help
from
time
to
time
we
can
employ
her
under
our
own
superintendence
have
you
anything
else
selina
to
suggest
there
was
nothing
left
to
suggest
young
and
inexperienced
as
she
was
how
i
asked
had
she
contrived
to
think
of
all
this
she
answered
simply
i
m
sure
i
don
t
know
my
thoughts
came
to
me
while
i
was
looking
at
soon
afterward
i
found
an
opportunity
of
inquiring
if
helena
had
left
the
house
she
had
just
rung
her
bell
and
maria
had
found
her
quietly
reading
in
her
room
hours
afterward
when
i
was
on
the
watch
at
night
i
heard
philip
s
door
softly
tried
from
the
outside
her
dreadful
purpose
had
not
been
given
up
even
yet
the
doctor
came
in
the
evening
as
he
had
promised
and
found
an
improvement
in
philip
s
health
i
mentioned
what
precautions
we
had
taken
and
that
they
had
been
devised
by
euneece
are
you
going
to
withdraw
from
the
case
i
asked
i
am
coming
back
to
the
case
he
answered
it
had
been
a
disappointment
to
me
to
receive
no
answer
to
the
telegram
which
i
had
sent
to
dunboyne
the
elder
the
next
day
s
post
brought
the
explanation
in
a
letter
to
philip
from
his
father
directed
to
him
at
the
hotel
here
this
showed
that
my
telegram
giving
my
address
at
this
house
had
not
been
received
dunboyne
announced
that
he
had
returned
to
ireland
finding
the
air
of
london
unendurable
after
the
at
home
if
philip
had
already
married
his
father
would
leave
him
to
a
life
of
genteel
poverty
with
helena
gracedieu
if
he
had
thought
better
of
it
his
welcome
was
waiting
for
him
little
did
dunboyne
know
what
changes
had
taken
place
since
he
and
his
son
had
last
met
and
what
hope
might
yet
present
itself
of
brighter
days
for
poor
euneece
i
thought
of
writing
to
him
but
how
would
that
crabbed
old
man
receive
a
confidential
letter
from
a
lady
who
was
a
stranger
my
doubts
were
set
at
rest
by
philip
himself
he
asked
me
to
write
a
few
lines
of
reply
to
his
father
declaring
that
his
marriage
with
helena
was
broken
off
that
he
had
not
given
up
all
hope
of
being
permitted
to
offer
the
sincere
expression
of
his
penitence
to
euneece
and
that
he
would
gladly
claim
his
welcome
as
soon
as
he
was
well
enough
to
undertake
the
journey
to
ireland
when
he
had
signed
the
letter
i
was
so
pleased
that
i
made
a
smart
remark
i
said
this
is
a
treaty
of
peace
between
father
and
when
the
doctor
arrived
in
the
morning
and
found
the
change
for
the
better
in
his
patient
confirmed
he
did
justice
to
us
at
last
he
spoke
kindly
and
even
gratefully
to
euneece
no
more
allusions
to
the
hospital
as
a
place
of
safety
escaped
him
he
asked
me
cautiously
for
news
of
helena
i
could
only
tell
him
that
she
had
gone
out
at
her
customary
time
and
had
returned
at
her
customary
time
he
did
not
attempt
to
conceal
that
my
reply
had
made
him
uneasy
are
you
still
afraid
that
she
may
succeed
in
poisoning
philip
i
asked
i
am
afraid
of
her
cunning
he
said
if
she
is
charged
with
attempting
to
poison
young
dunboyne
she
has
some
system
of
defense
you
may
rely
on
it
for
which
we
are
not
prepared
there
in
my
opinion
is
the
true
reason
for
her
extraordinary
insensibility
to
her
own
two
more
days
passed
and
we
were
still
safe
under
the
protection
of
lock
and
key
on
the
evening
of
the
second
day
which
was
a
monday
maria
came
to
me
in
great
tribulation
on
inquiring
what
was
the
matter
i
received
a
disquieting
reply
miss
helena
is
tempting
me
she
is
so
miserable
at
being
prevented
from
seeing
philip
and
helping
to
nurse
him
that
it
is
quite
distressing
to
see
her
at
the
same
time
miss
it
s
hard
on
a
poor
servant
she
asks
me
to
take
the
key
secretly
out
of
the
door
and
lend
it
to
her
at
night
for
a
few
minutes
only
i
m
really
afraid
i
shall
be
led
into
doing
it
if
she
goes
on
persuading
me
much
i
commended
maria
for
feeling
scruples
which
proved
her
to
be
the
best
of
good
girls
and
promised
to
relieve
her
from
all
fear
of
future
temptation
this
was
easily
done
euneece
kept
the
key
of
philip
s
door
in
her
pocket
and
i
kept
the
key
of
the
door
in
mine
chapter
lxi
atrocity
on
the
next
day
a
tuesday
in
the
week
an
event
took
place
which
euneece
and
i
viewed
with
distrust
early
in
the
afternoon
a
young
man
called
with
a
note
for
helena
it
was
to
be
given
to
her
immediately
and
no
answer
was
required
maria
had
just
closed
the
house
door
and
was
on
her
way
upstairs
with
the
letter
when
she
was
called
back
by
another
ring
at
the
bell
our
visitor
was
the
doctor
he
spoke
to
maria
in
the
hall
i
think
i
see
a
note
in
your
hand
was
it
given
to
you
by
the
young
man
who
has
just
left
the
house
yes
sir
if
he
s
your
sweetheart
my
dear
i
have
nothing
more
to
good
gracious
doctor
how
you
do
talk
i
never
saw
the
young
man
before
in
my
in
that
case
maria
i
will
ask
you
to
let
me
look
at
the
address
aha
mischief
the
moment
i
heard
that
i
threw
open
the
door
curiosity
is
not
easily
satisfied
when
it
hears
it
wants
to
see
when
it
sees
it
wants
to
know
every
lady
will
agree
with
me
in
this
observation
pray
come
in
i
said
one
minute
miss
jillgall
my
girl
when
you
give
miss
helena
that
note
try
to
get
a
sly
look
at
her
when
she
opens
it
and
come
and
tell
me
what
you
have
he
joined
me
in
the
and
closed
the
door
the
other
day
he
went
on
when
i
told
you
what
i
had
discovered
in
the
chemist
s
shop
i
think
i
mentioned
a
young
man
who
was
called
to
speak
to
a
question
of
identity
an
assistant
who
knew
miss
helena
gracedieu
by
yes
yes
that
young
man
left
the
note
which
maria
has
just
taken
who
wrote
it
doctor
and
what
does
it
say
questions
naturally
asked
miss
jillgall
and
not
easily
answered
where
is
eunice
her
quick
wit
might
help
she
had
gone
out
to
buy
some
fruit
and
flowers
for
philip
the
doctor
accepted
his
disappointment
resignedly
let
us
try
what
we
can
do
without
her
he
said
that
young
man
s
master
has
been
in
consultation
you
may
remember
why
with
his
lawyer
and
helena
may
be
threatened
by
an
investigation
before
the
magistrates
if
this
wild
guess
of
mine
turns
out
to
have
hit
the
mark
the
poisoner
upstairs
has
got
a
i
asked
if
the
chemist
had
written
the
note
foolish
enough
of
me
when
i
came
to
think
of
it
the
chemist
would
scarcely
act
a
friendly
part
toward
helena
when
she
was
answerable
for
the
awkward
position
in
which
he
had
placed
himself
perhaps
the
young
man
who
had
left
the
warning
was
also
the
writer
of
the
warning
the
doctor
reminded
me
that
he
was
all
but
a
stranger
to
helena
we
are
not
usually
interested
he
remarked
in
a
person
whom
we
only
know
by
remember
that
he
is
a
young
man
i
ventured
to
say
this
was
a
strong
hint
but
the
doctor
failed
to
see
it
he
had
evidently
forgotten
his
own
youth
i
made
another
attempt
and
vile
as
helena
is
i
continued
we
can
not
deny
that
this
disgrace
to
her
sex
is
a
handsome
young
he
saw
it
at
last
woman
s
wit
he
cried
you
have
hit
it
miss
jillgall
the
young
fool
is
smitten
with
her
and
has
given
her
a
chance
of
making
her
do
you
think
she
will
take
the
chance
for
all
our
sakes
i
pray
god
she
may
but
i
don
t
feel
sure
about
why
recollect
what
you
and
eunice
have
done
you
have
shown
your
suspicion
of
her
without
an
attempt
to
conceal
it
if
you
had
put
her
in
prison
you
could
not
have
more
completely
defeated
her
infernal
design
do
you
think
she
is
a
likely
person
to
submit
to
that
without
an
effort
to
be
even
with
you
just
as
he
said
those
terrifying
words
maria
came
back
to
us
he
asked
at
once
what
had
kept
her
so
long
upstairs
the
girl
had
evidently
something
to
say
which
had
inflated
her
if
i
may
use
such
an
expression
with
a
sense
of
her
own
importance
please
to
let
me
tell
it
sir
she
answered
in
my
own
way
miss
helena
turned
as
pale
as
ashes
when
she
opened
the
letter
and
then
she
took
a
turn
in
the
room
and
then
she
looked
at
me
with
a
smile
well
miss
i
can
only
say
that
i
felt
that
smile
in
the
small
of
my
back
i
tried
to
get
to
the
door
she
stopped
me
she
says
where
s
miss
eunice
i
says
gone
she
says
is
there
anybody
in
the
i
says
no
she
says
tell
miss
jillgall
i
want
to
speak
to
her
and
say
i
am
waiting
in
the
it
s
every
word
of
it
true
and
if
a
poor
servant
may
give
an
opinion
i
don
t
like
the
look
of
the
doctor
dismissed
maria
whatever
it
is
he
said
to
me
you
must
go
and
hear
i
am
not
a
courageous
woman
i
expressed
myself
as
being
willing
to
go
to
her
if
the
doctor
went
with
me
he
said
that
was
impossible
she
would
probably
refuse
to
speak
before
any
witness
and
certainly
before
him
but
he
promised
to
look
after
philip
in
my
absence
and
to
wait
below
if
it
really
so
happened
that
i
wanted
him
i
need
only
ring
the
bell
and
he
would
come
to
me
the
moment
he
heard
it
such
kindness
as
this
roused
my
courage
i
suppose
at
any
rate
i
went
upstairs
she
was
standing
by
the
with
her
elbow
on
the
and
her
head
resting
on
her
hand
i
stopped
just
inside
the
door
waiting
to
hear
what
she
had
to
say
in
this
position
her
only
was
presented
to
me
it
was
a
ghastly
face
the
eye
that
i
could
see
turned
wickedly
on
me
when
i
came
in
then
turned
away
again
otherwise
she
never
moved
i
confess
i
trembled
but
i
did
my
best
to
disguise
it
she
broke
out
suddenly
with
what
she
had
to
say
i
won
t
allow
this
state
of
things
to
go
on
any
longer
my
horror
of
an
exposure
which
will
disgrace
the
family
has
kept
me
silent
wrongly
silent
so
far
philip
s
life
is
in
danger
i
am
forgetting
my
duty
to
my
affianced
husband
if
i
allow
myself
to
be
kept
away
from
him
any
longer
open
those
locked
doors
and
relieve
me
from
the
sight
of
you
open
the
doors
i
say
or
you
will
both
of
you
you
the
accomplice
she
the
wretch
who
directs
you
repent
it
to
the
end
of
your
in
my
own
mind
i
asked
myself
if
she
had
gone
mad
but
i
only
answered
i
don
t
understand
she
said
again
you
are
eunice
s
accomplice
in
what
i
asked
she
turned
her
head
slowly
and
faced
me
i
shrank
from
looking
at
her
all
the
circumstances
prove
it
she
went
on
i
have
supplanted
eunice
in
philip
s
affection
she
was
once
engaged
to
marry
him
i
am
engaged
to
marry
him
now
she
is
resolved
that
he
shall
never
make
me
his
wife
he
will
die
if
i
delay
any
longer
he
will
die
if
i
don
t
crush
her
like
the
reptile
she
is
she
comes
here
and
what
does
she
do
keeps
him
prisoner
under
her
own
superintendence
who
gets
his
medicine
she
gets
it
who
cooks
his
food
she
cooks
it
the
doors
are
locked
i
might
be
a
witness
of
what
goes
on
and
i
am
kept
out
the
servants
who
ought
to
wait
on
him
are
kept
out
she
can
do
what
she
likes
with
his
medicine
she
can
do
what
she
likes
with
his
food
she
is
infuriated
with
him
for
deserting
her
and
promising
to
marry
me
give
him
back
to
my
care
or
dreadful
as
it
is
to
denounce
my
own
sister
i
shall
claim
protection
from
the
i
lost
all
fear
of
her
i
stepped
close
up
to
the
place
at
which
she
was
standing
i
cried
out
of
what
in
god
s
name
do
you
accuse
your
sister
she
answered
i
accuse
her
of
poisoning
philip
i
ran
out
of
the
room
i
rushed
headlong
down
the
stairs
the
doctor
heard
me
and
came
running
into
the
hall
i
caught
hold
of
him
like
a
madwoman
euneece
my
breath
was
gone
i
could
only
say
euneece
he
dragged
me
into
the
there
was
wine
on
the
which
he
had
ordered
medically
for
philip
he
forced
me
to
drink
some
of
it
it
ran
through
me
like
fire
it
helped
me
to
speak
now
tell
me
he
said
what
has
she
done
to
eunice
she
brings
a
horrible
accusation
against
her
i
answered
what
is
the
accusation
i
told
him
he
looked
me
through
and
through
take
care
he
said
no
hysterics
no
exaggeration
you
may
lead
to
dreadful
consequences
if
you
are
not
sure
of
yourself
if
it
s
really
true
say
it
i
said
it
again
quietly
this
time
his
face
startled
me
it
was
white
with
rage
he
snatched
his
hat
off
the
hall
table
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
asked
my
he
was
out
of
the
house
before
i
could
speak
to
him
again

and

tranquillity
were
threatened
by
the
most
infamous
of
false
accusations

only
of
what
she
wrote
assisted
by
the
newspaper
which
she
sent
to
me
while
the
legal
proceedings
were
in
progress
honest
indignation
does
sometimes
counsel
us
wisely
when
the
doctor
left
miss
jillgall
in
anger
and
in
haste
he
had
determined
on
taking
the
course
from
which
as
a
humane
man
and
a
faithful
friend
he
had
hitherto
recoiled
it
was
no
time
now
to
shrink
from
the
prospect
of
an
exposure
the
one
hope
of
successfully
encountering
the
vindictive
wickedness
of
helena
lay
in
the
resolution
to
be
beforehand
with
her
in
the
appeal
to
the
magistrates
with
which
she
had
threatened
eunice
and
miss
jillgall
the
doctor
s
sworn
information
stated
the
whole
terrible
case
of
the
poisoning
ranging
from
his
first
suspicions
and
their
confirmation
to
helena
s
atrocious
attempt
to
accuse
her
innocent
sister
of
her
own
guilt
so
firmly
were
the
magistrates
convinced
of
the
serious
nature
of
the
case
thus
stated
that
they
did
not
hesitate
to
issue
their
warrant
among
the
witnesses
whose
attendance
was
immediately
secured
by
the
legal
adviser
to
whom
the
doctor
applied
were
the
farmer
and
his
wife
helena
was
arrested
while
she
was
dressing
to
go
out
her
composure
was
not
for
a
moment
disturbed
i
was
on
my
way
she
said
coolly
to
make
a
statement
before
the
justices
the
sooner
they
hear
what
i
have
to
say
the
the
attempt
of
this
shameless
wretch
to
turn
the
tables
on
poor
eunice
suggested
as
i
afterward
discovered
by
the
record
of
family
history
which
she
had
quoted
in
her
journal
was
defeated
with
ease
the
farmer
and
his
wife
proved
the
date
at
which
eunice
had
left
her
place
of
residence
under
their
roof
the
doctor
s
evidence
followed
he
proved
by
the
production
of
his
professional
diary
that
the
discovery
of
the
attempt
to
poison
his
patient
had
taken
place
before
the
day
of
eunice
s
departure
from
the
farm
and
that
the
first
improvement
in
philip
dunboyne
s
state
of
health
had
shown
itself
after
that
young
lady
s
arrival
to
perform
the
duties
of
a
nurse
to
the
wise
precautions
which
she
had
taken
perverted
by
helena
to
the
purpose
of
a
false
accusation
the
doctor
attributed
the
preservation
of
the
young
man
s
life
having
produced
the
worst
possible
impression
on
the
minds
of
the
magistrates
helena
was
remanded
her
legal
adviser
had
predicted
this
result
but
the
vindictive
obstinacy
of
his
client
had
set
both
experience
and
remonstrance
at
defiance
at
the
renewed
examination
the
line
of
defense
adopted
by
the
prisoner
s
lawyer
proved
to
be
mistaken
identity
it
was
asserted
that
she
had
never
entered
the
chemist
s
shop
also
that
the
assistant
had
wrongly
identified
some
other
lady
as
miss
helena
gracedieu
also
that
there
was
not
an
atom
of
evidence
to
connect
her
with
the
stealing
of
the
doctor
s
and
the
forgery
of
his
writing
other
assertions
to
the
same
purpose
followed
on
which
it
is
needless
to
dwell
the
case
for
the
prosecution
was
happily
in
competent
hands
with
the
exception
of
one
witness
afforded
no
material
help
to
the
evidence
for
the
defense
the
chemist
swore
positively
to
the
personal
appearance
of
helena
as
being
the
personal
appearance
of
the
lady
who
had
presented
the
prescription
his
assistant
pressed
on
the
question
of
identity
broke
down
under
purposely
as
it
was
whispered
serving
the
interests
of
the
prisoner
but
the
victory
so
far
gained
by
the
defense
was
successfully
contested
by
the
statement
of
the
next
witness
a
respectable
tradesman
in
the
town
he
had
seen
the
newspaper
report
of
the
first
examination
and
had
volunteered
to
present
himself
as
a
witness
a
member
of
gracedieu
s
congregation
his
pew
in
the
chapel
was
so
situated
as
to
give
him
a
view
of
the
minister
s
daughters
occupying
their
pew
he
had
seen
the
prisoner
on
every
sunday
for
years
past
and
he
swore
that
he
was
passing
the
door
of
the
chemist
s
shop
at
the
moment
when
she
stepped
out
into
the
street
having
a
bottle
covered
with
the
customary
white
paper
in
her
hand
the
doctor
and
his
servant
were
the
next
witnesses
called
they
were
severely
some
of
their
statements
questioned
technically
with
success
received
unexpected
and
powerful
support
due
to
the
discovery
and
production
of
the
prisoner
s
diary
the
entries
guardedly
as
some
of
them
were
written
revealed
her
motive

philip
dunboyne
proved
that
she
had
purposely
called
on
the
doctor
when
she
knew
that
he
would
be
out
that
she
had
entered
the
and
examined
the
medical
books
had
found
to
use
her
own
written
words
a
volume
that
interested
her
and
had
used
the
for
the
purpose
of
making
notes
the
notes
themselves
were
not
to
be
found
they
had
doubtless
been
destroyed
enough
and
more
than
enough
remained

for

at
the
next
assizes
i
arrived
in
the
town
as
well
as
i
can
remember
about
a
week
after
the
trial
had
taken
place
found
guilty
the
prisoner
had
been
recommended
to
mercy
by
the
jury
partly
in
consideration
of
her
youth
partly
as
an
expression
of
sympathy
and
respect
for
her
unhappy
father
the
judge
a
father
himself
passed
a
lenient
sentence
she
was
condemned
to
imprisonment
for
two
years
the
careful
matron
of
the
jail
had
provided
herself
with
a
bottle
of
in
the
fear
that
there
might
be
need
for
it
when
helena
heard
her
sentence
pronounced
not
the
slightest
sign
of
agitation
appeared
in
her
face
or
her
manner
she
lied
to
the
last
asserting
her
innocence
in
a
firm
voice
and
returning
from
the
dock
to
the
prison
without
requiring
assistance
from
anybody
relating
these
particulars
to
me
in
a
state
of
ungovernable
excitement
good
miss
jillgall
ended
with
a
little
confession
of
her
own
which
operated
as
a
relief
to
my
overburdened
mind
after
what
i
had
just
heard
i
wouldn
t
own
it
she
said
to
anybody
but
a
dear
friend
one
thing
in
the
dreadful
disgrace
that
has
fallen
on
us
i
am
quite
at
a
loss
to
account
for
think
of
gracedieu
s
daughter
being
one
of
those
criminal
creatures
on
whom
it
was
once
your
terrible
duty
to
turn
the
key
why
didn
t
she
commit
suicide
my
dear
lady
no
thoroughly
wicked
creature
ever
yet
committed
suicide
when
it
is
not
an
act
of
madness
implies
some
acuteness
of
feeling
sensibility
to
remorse
or
to
shame
or
perhaps
a
distorted
idea
of
making
atonement
there
is
no
such
thing
as
remorse
or
shame
or
hope
of
making
atonement
in
helena

but
when
she
comes

the
obstacle
removed
when
the
subject
of
the
trial
was
happily
dismissed
my
first
inquiry
related
to
eunice
the
reply
was
made
with
an
ominous
accompaniment
of
sighs
and
sad
looks
eunice
had
gone
back
to
her
duties
as
governess
at
the
farm
hearing
this
i
asked
naturally
what
had
become
of
philip
melancholy
news
again
was
the
news
that
i
now
heard
dunboyne
the
elder
had
died
suddenly
at
his
house
in
ireland
while
philip
was
on
his
way
home
when
the
funeral
ceremony
had
come
to
an
end
the
will
was
read
it
had
been
made
only
a
few
days
before
the
testator
s
death
and
the
clause
which
left
all
his
property
to
his
son
was
preceded
by
expressions
of
paternal
affection
at
a
time
when
philip
was
in
sore
need
of
consolation
after
alluding
to
a
letter
received
from
his
son
the
old
man
added
i
always
loved
him
without
caring
to
confess
it
i
detest
scenes
of
sentiment
kissings
embracings
tears
and
that
sort
of
thing
but
philip
has
yielded
to
my
wishes
and
has
broken
off
a
marriage
which
would
have
made
him
as
well
as
me
wretched
for
life
after
this
i
may
speak
my
mind
from
my
grave
and
may
tell
my
boy
that
i
loved
him
if
the
wish
is
likely
to
be
of
any
use
i
will
add
on
the
chance
god
bless
does
philip
submit
to
separation
from
eunice
i
asked
does
he
stay
in
ireland
not
he
poor
fellow
he
will
be
here
or
next
day
when
i
last
wrote
miss
jillgall
continued
i
told
him
i
hoped
to
see
you
again
soon
if
you
can
t
help
us
i
mean
with
eunice
that
unlucky
young
man
will
do
some
desperate
thing
he
will
join
those
madmen
at
large
who
disturb
poor
savages
in
africa
or
go
nowhere
to
find
nothing
in
the
arctic
regions
whatever
i
can
do
miss
jillgall
shall
be
gladly
done
is
it
really
possible
that
eunice
refuses
to
marry
him
after
having
saved
his
life
a
little
patience
please
mr
governor
let
philip
tell
his
own
story
if
i
try
to
do
it
i
shall
only
cry
and
we
have
had
tears
enough
lately
in
this
further
consultation
being
thus
deferred
i
went
upstairs
to
the
minister
s
room
he
was
sitting
by
the
window
in
his
favorite
armchair
absorbed
in
knitting
the
person
who
attended
on
him
a
patient
fellow
had
been
a
sailor
in
his
younger
days
and
had
taught
gracedieu
how
to
use
the
needles
you
see
it
amuses
him
the
man
said
kindly
don
t
notice
his
mistakes
he
thinks
there
isn
t
such
another
in
the
world
for
knitting
as
himself
you
can
see
sir
how
he
sticks
to
he
was
so
absorbed
over
his
employment
that
i
had
to
speak
to
him
twice
before
i
could
induce
him
to
look
at
me
the
utter
ruin
of
his
intellect
did
not
appear
to
have
exercised
any
disastrous
influence
over
his
bodily
health
on
the
contrary
he
had
grown
fatter
since
i
had
last
seen
him
his
complexion
had
lost
the
pallor
that
i
remembered
there
was
color
in
his
cheeks
don
t
you
remember
your
old
friend
i
said
he
smiled
and
nodded
and
repeated
the
words
yes
yes
my
old
it
was
only
too
plain
that
he
had
not
the
least
recollection
of
me
his
memory
is
gone
the
man
said
when
he
puts
away
his
knitting
at
night
i
have
to
find
it
for
him
in
the
morning
but
there
he
s
happy
enjoys
his
victuals
likes
sitting
out
in
the
garden
and
watching
the
birds
there
s
been
a
deal
of
trouble
in
the
family
sir
and
it
has
all
passed
over
him
like
a
wet
sponge
over
a
the
old
sailor
was
right
if
that
wreck
of
a
man
had
been
capable
of
feeling
and
thinking
his
daughter
s
disgrace
would
have
broken
his
heart
in
a
world
of
sin
and
sorrow
is
peaceable
imbecility
always
to
be
pitied
i
have
known
men
who
would
have
answered
without
hesitation
it
is
to
be
and
where
some
persons
might
say
was
the
poor
minister
s
reward
for
the
act
of
mercy
which
had
saved
eunice
in
her
infancy
where
it
ought
to
be
a
man
who
worthily
performs
a
good
action
finds
his
reward
in
the
action
itself
at
breakfast
on
the
next
day
the
talk
touched
on
those
passages
in
helena
s
diary
which
had
been
produced
in
court
as
evidence
against
her
i
expressed
a
wish
to
see
what
revelation
of
a
depraved
nature
the
entries
in
the
diary
might
present
and
my
curiosity
was
gratified
at
a
fitter
time
i
may
find
an
opportunity
of
alluding
to
the
impression
produced
on
me
by
the
diary
in
the
meanwhile
the
event
of
philip
s
return
claims
notice
in
the
first
place
the
poor
fellow
was
so
glad
to
see
me
that
he
shook
hands
as
heartily
as
if
we
had
known
each
other
from
the
time
when
he
was
a
boy
do
you
remember
how
kindly
you
spoke
to
me
when
i
called
on
you
in
london
he
asked
if
i
have
repeated
those
words
once
but
perhaps
you
don
t
remember
them
you
said
if
i
was
as
young
as
you
are
i
should
not
well
i
have
said
that
to
myself
over
and
over
again
for
a
hundred
times
at
least
eunice
will
listen
to
you
sir
when
she
will
listen
to
nobody
else
this
is
the
first
happy
moment
i
have
had
for
weeks
i
suppose
i
must
have
looked
glad
to
hear
that
anyway
philip
shook
hands
with
me
again
miss
jillgall
was
present
the
old
maid
was
so
touched
by
our
meeting
that
she
abandoned
herself
to
the
genial
impulse
of
the
moment
and
gave
philip
a
kiss
the
outraged
claims
of
propriety
instantly
seized
on
her
she
blushed
as
if
the
days
of
her
girlhood
had
been
found
again
and
ran
out
of
the
room
now
philip
i
said
i
have
been
waiting
at
miss
jillgall
s
suggestion
to
get
my
information
from
you
there
is
something
wrong
between
eunice
and
yourself
what
is
it
and
who
is
to
blame
her
vile
sister
is
to
blame
he
answered
that
reptile
was
determined
to
sting
us
and
she
has
done
it
he
cried
starting
to
his
feet
and
walking
up
and
down
the
room
urged
into
action
by
his
own
unendurable
sense
of
wrong
i
say
she
has
done
it
after
eunice
has
saved
me
done
it
when
eunice
was
ready
to
be
my
how
has
she
done
it
between
grief
and
indignation
his
reply
was
involved
in
a
confusion
of
words
which
i
shall
not
attempt
to
reproduce
eunice
had
reminded
him
that
her
sister
had
been
publicly
convicted
of
an
infamous
crime
and
publicly
punished
for
it
by
imprisonment
if
i
consent
to
marry
you
she
said
i
stain
you
with
my
disgrace
that
shall
never
with
this
resolution
she
had
left
him
i
have
tried
to
convince
her
philip
said
that
she
will
not
be
associated
with
her
sister
s
disgrace
when
she
bears
my
name
i
have
promised
to
take
her
far
away
from
england
among
people
who
have
never
even
heard
of
her
sister
miss
jillgall
has
used
her
influence
to
help
me
all
in
vain
there
is
no
hope
for
us
but
in
you
i
am
not
thinking
selfishly
only
of
myself
she
tries
to
conceal
it
but
oh
she
is
ask
the
farmer
s
wife
if
you
don
t
believe
me
judge
for
yourself
sir
go
for
god
s
sake
go
to
the
i
made
him
sit
down
and
compose
himself
you
may
depend
on
my
going
to
the
farm
i
answered
i
shall
write
to
eunice
and
follow
my
letter
he
tried
to
thank
me
but
i
would
not
allow
it
before
i
consent
to
accept
the
expression
of
your
gratitude
i
said
i
must
know
a
little
more
of
you
than
i
know
now
this
is
only
the
second
occasion
on
which
we
have
met
let
us
look
back
a
little
philip
dunboyne
you
were
eunice
s
affianced
husband
and
you
broke
faith
with
her
that
was
a
rascally
action
how
do
you
defend
it
his
head
sank
i
am
ashamed
to
defend
it
he
answered
i
pressed
him
without
mercy
you
own
yourself
i
said
that
it
was
a
rascally
action
use
stronger
language
against
me
even
than
that
sir
i
deserve
in
plain
words
i
went
on
you
can
find
no
excuse
for
your
conduct
in
the
past
time
he
said
i
might
have
found
but
you
can
t
find
them
now
i
must
not
even
look
for
them
why
not
i
owe
it
to
eunice
to
leave
my
conduct
at
its
worst
with
nothing
said
by
me
to
defend
what
has
eunice
done
to
have
such
a
claim
on
you
as
that
eunice
has
forgiven
it
was
gratefully
and
delicately
said
ought
i
to
have
allowed
this
circumstance
to
weigh
with
me
i
ask
in
return
had
never
committed
any
faults
as
a
and
had
i
any
right
to
harden
my
heart
against
an
expression
of
penitence
which
i
felt
to
be
sincere
in
its
motive
but
i
was
bound
to
think
of
eunice
i
did
think
of
her
before
i
ventured
to
accept
the
position
the
critical
position
as
i
shall
presently
show
of
philip
s
friend
after
more
than
an
hour
of
questions
put
without
reserve
and
of
answers
given
without
prevarication
i
had
traveled
over
the
whole
ground
laid
out
by
the
narratives
which
appear
in
these
pages
and
had
arrived
at
my
conclusion
so
far
as
philip
dunboyne
was
concerned
i
found
him
to
be
a
man
with
nothing
absolutely
wicked
in
him
but
with
a
nature
so
perilously
weak
in
many
respects
that
it
might
drift
into
wickedness
unless
a
stronger
nature
was
at
hand
to
bold
it
back
married
to
a
wife
without
force
of
character
the
probabilities
would
point
to
him
as
likely
to
yield
to
examples
which
might
make
him
a
bad
husband
married
to
a
wife
with
a
will
of
her
own
and
with
true
love
to
sustain
her
a
wife
who
would
know
when
to
take
the
command
and
how
to
take
the
command
a
wife
who
finding
him
tempted
to
commit
actions
unworthy
of
his
better
self
would
be
enough
to
perceive
that
her
husband
s
sense
of
honor
might
sometimes
lose
its
balance
without
being
on
that
account
hopelessly
depraved
then
and
in
these
cases
only
the
probabilities
would
point
to
philip
as
a
man
likely
to
be
the
better
and
the
happier
for
his
situation
when
the
bonds
of
wedlock
had
got
him
but
the
serious
question
was
not
answered
yet
could
i
feel
justified
in
placing
eunice
in
the
position
toward
philip
which
i
have
just
endeavored
to
describe
i
dared
not
allow
my
mind
to
dwell
on
the
generosity
which
had
so
nobly
pardoned
him
or
on
the
force
of
character
which
had
bravely
endured
the
bitterest
disappointment
the
cruelest
humiliation
the
one
consideration
which
i
was
bound
to
face
was
the
sacred
consideration
of
her
happiness
in
her
life
to
come
leaving
philip
with
a
few
words
of
sympathy
which
might
help
him
to
bear
his
suspense
i
went
to
my
room
to
think
the
time
passed
and
i
could
arrive
at
no
positive
conclusion
either
way
with
or
without
philip
the
contemplation
of
eunice
s
future
harassed
me
with
doubt
even
if
i
had
conquered
my
own
indecision
and
had
made
up
my
mind
to
sanction
the
union
of
the
two
young
people
the
difficulties
that
now
beset
me
would
not
have
been
dispersed
knowing
what
i
alone
knew
i
could
certainly
remove
eunice
s
one
objection
to
the
marriage
in
other
words
i
had
only
to
relate
what
had
happened
on
the
day
when
the
chaplain
brought
the
minister
to
the
prison
and
the
obstacle
of
their
union
would
be
removed
but
without
considering
philip
it
was
simply
out
of
the
question
to
do
this
in
mercy
to
eunice
herself
what
was
helena
s
disgrace
compared
with
the
infamy
which
stained
the
name
of
the
poor
girl
s
mother
the
other
alternative
of
telling
her
part
of
the
truth
only
was
before
me
if
i
could
persuade
myself
to
adopt
it
i
failed
to
persuade
myself
my
morbid
anxiety
for
her
welfare
made
me
hesitate
again
human
patience
could
endure
no
more
rashness
prevailed
and
prudence
yielded
i
left
my
decision
to
be
influenced
by
the
coming
interview
with
eunice
the
next
day
i
drove
to
the
farm
philip
s
entreaties
persuaded
me
to
let
him
be
my
companion
on
one
condition
that
he
waited
in
the
carriage
while
i
went
into
the
house
i
had
carefully
arranged
my
ideas
and
had
decided
on
proceeding
with
the
greatest
caution
before
i
ventured
on
saying
the
words
which
once
spoken
were
not
to
be
recalled
the
worst
of
those
anxieties
under
which
the
delicate
health
of
gracedieu
had
broken
down
was
my
anxiety
now
could
i
reconcile
it
to
my
conscience
to
permit
a
man
innocent
of
all
knowledge
of
the
truth
to
marry
the
daughter
of
a
condemned
murderess
without
honestly
telling
him
what
he
was
about
to
do
did
i
deserve
to
be
pitied
did
i
deserve
to
be
blamed
my
mind
was
still
undecided
when
i
entered
the
house
she
ran
to
meet
me
as
if
she
had
been
my
daughter
she
kissed
me
as
if
she
had
been
my
daughter
she
fondly
looked
up
at
me
as
if
she
had
been
my
daughter
at
the
sight
of
that
sweet
young
face
so
sorrowful
and
so
patiently
enduring
sorrow
all
my
doubts
and
hesitations
everything
artificial
about
me
with
which
i
had
entered
the
room
vanished
in
an
instant
after
she
had
thanked
me
for
coming
to
see
her
i
saw
her
tremble
a
little
the
uppermost
interest
in
her
heart
was
forcing
its
way
outward
to
expression
try
as
she
might
to
keep
it
back
have
you
seen
philip
she
asked
the
tone
in
which
she
put
that
question
decided
me
i
was
resolved
to
let
her
marry
him
impulse
yes
impulse
asserting
itself
inexcusably
in
a
man
at
the
end
of
his
life
i
ought
to
have
known
better
than
to
have
given
way
very
likely
but
am
i
the
only
mortal
who
ought
to
have
known
better
and
did
not
when
eunice
asked
if
i
had
seen
philip
i
owned
that
he
was
outside
in
the
carriage
before
she
could
reproach
me
i
went
on
with
what
i
had
to
say
my
child
i
know
what
a
sacrifice
you
have
made
and
i
should
honor
your
scruples
if
you
had
any
reason
for
feeling
any
reason
for
feeling
them
she
turned
pale
as
she
repeated
the
words
an
idea
came
to
me
i
rang
for
the
servant
and
sent
her
to
the
carriage
to
tell
philip
to
come
in
my
dear
i
am
not
putting
you
to
any
unfair
trial
i
assured
her
i
am
going
to
prove
that
i
love
you
as
truly
as
if
you
were
my
own
when
they
were
both
present
i
resolved
that
they
should
not
suffer
a
moment
of
needless
suspense
standing
between
them
i
took
eunice
s
hand
and
laid
my
other
hand
on
philip
s
shoulder
and
spoke
out
plainly
i
am
here
to
make
you
both
happy
i
said
i
can
remove
the
only
obstacle
to
your
marriage
and
i
mean
to
do
it
but
i
must
insist
on
one
condition
give
me
your
promise
philip
that
you
will
ask
for
no
explanations
and
that
you
will
be
satisfied
with
the
one
true
statement
which
is
all
that
i
can
offer
to
he
gave
me
his
promise
without
an
instant
s
hesitation
philip
grants
what
i
ask
i
said
to
eunice
do
you
grant
it
too
her
hand
turned
cold
in
mine
but
she
spoke
firmly
when
she
said
i
gave
her
into
philip
s
care
it
was
his
privilege
to
console
and
support
her
it
was
my
duty
to
say
the
decisive
words
rouse
your
courage
dear
eunice
you
are
no
more
affected
by
helena
s
disgrace
than
i
am
you
are
not
her
sister
her
father
is
not
your
father
her
mother
was
not
your
mother
i
was
present
in
the
time
of
your
infancy
when
gracedieu
s
fatherly
kindness
received
you
as
his
adopted
child
this
i
declare
to
you
both
on
my
word
of
honor
is
the
how
she
bore
it
i
am
not
able
to
say
my
foolish
old
eyes
were
filling
with
tears
i
could
just
see
plainly
enough
to
find
my
way
to
the
door
and
leave
them
together
in
my
reckless
state
of
mind
i
never
asked
myself
if
time
would
be
my
accomplice
and
keep
the
part
of
the
secret
which
i
had
not
revealed
or
be
my
enemy
and
betray
me
the
chances
either
way
were
perhaps
equal
the
deed
was
done
chapter
lxiv
the
truth
triumphant
the
marriage
was
deferred
at
eunice
s
request
as
an
expression
of
respect
to
the
memory
of
philip
s
father
when
the
time
of
delay
had
passed
it
was
arranged
that
the
wedding
ceremony
should
be
held
after
due
publication
of
banns
at
the
parish
church
of
the
london
suburb
in
which
my
house
was
situated
miss
jillgall
was
bridesmaid
and
i
gave
away
the
bride
before
we
set
out
for
the
church
eunice
asked
leave
to
speak
with
me
for
a
moment
in
private
don
t
think
she
said
that
i
am
forgetting
my
promise
to
be
content
with
what
you
have
told
me
about
myself
i
am
not
so
ungrateful
as
that
but
i
do
want
before
i
consent
to
be
philip
s
wife
to
feel
sure
that
i
am
not
quite
unworthy
of
him
is
it
because
i
am
of
mean
birth
that
you
told
me
i
was
gracedieu
s
adopted
child
and
told
me
no
more
i
could
honestly
satisfy
her
so
far
certainly
not
i
said
she
put
her
arms
round
my
neck
do
you
say
that
she
asked
to
make
my
mind
easy
or
do
you
say
it
on
your
word
of
honor
on
my
word
of
we
arrived
at
the
church
let
miss
jillgall
describe
the
marriage
in
her
own
inimitable
way
no
wedding
breakfast
when
you
don
t
want
to
eat
it
no
wedding
speeches
when
nobody
wants
to
make
them
and
nobody
wants
to
hear
them
and
no
false
sentiment
shedding
tears
and
reddening
noses
on
the
happiest
day
in
the
whole
year
a
model
marriage
i
could
desire
nothing
better
if
i
had
any
prospect
of
being
a
bride
they
went
away
for
their
honeymoon
to
a
quiet
place
by
the
seaside
not
very
far
from
the
town
in
which
eunice
had
passed
some
of
the
happiest
and
the
wretchedest
days
in
her
life
she
persisted
in
thinking
it
possible
that
gracedieu
might
recover
the
use
of
his
faculties
at
the
last
and
might
wish
to
see
her
on
his
his
adopted
daughter
she
gently
reminded
me
is
his
only
daughter
the
doctor
shook
his
head
when
i
told
him
what
eunice
had
said
to
me
and
the
sad
truth
must
be
told
the
doctor
was
right
miss
jillgall
returned
on
the
to
take
care
of
the
good
man
who
had
befriended
her
in
her
hour
of
need
before
the
end
of
the
week
i
heard
from
her
and
was
disagreeably
reminded
of
an
incident
which
we
had
both
forgotten
absorbed
as
we
were
in
other
and
greater
interests
at
the
time
tenbruggen
had
again
appeared
on
the
scene
she
had
written
to
miss
jillgall
from
paris
to
say
that
she
had
heard
of
old
dunboyne
s
death
and
that
she
wished
to
have
the
letter
returned
which
she
had
left
for
delivery
to
philip
s
father
on
the
day
when
philip
and
eunice
were
married
i
had
my
own
suspicions
of
what
that
letter
might
contain
and
i
regretted
that
miss
jillgall
had
sent
it
back
without
first
waiting
to
consult
me
my
misgivings
thus
excited
were
increased
by
more
news
of
no
very
welcome
kind
tenbruggen
had
decided
on
returning
to
her
professional
pursuits
in
england
massage
now
the
fashion
everywhere
had
put
money
into
her
pocket
among
the
foreigners
and
her
husband
finding
that
she
persisted
in
keeping
out
of
his
reach
had
consented
to
a
compromise
he
was
ready
to
submit
to
a
judicial
separation
in
consideration
of
a
little
income
which
his
wife
had
consented
to
settle
on
him
under
the
advice
of
her
lawyer
some
days
later
i
received
a
delightful
letter
from
philip
and
eunice
reminding
me
that
i
had
engaged
to
pay
them
a
visit
at
the
seaside
my
room
was
ready
for
me
and
i
was
left
to
choose
my
own
day
i
had
just
begun
to
write
my
reply
gladly
accepting
the
invitation
when
an
ominous
circumstance
occurred
my
servant
announced
a
lady
and
i
found
myself
face
to
face
with
tenbruggen
she
was
as
cheerful
as
ever
and
as
eminently
agreeable
as
ever
i
have
heard
it
all
from
selina
she
said
philip
s
marriage
to
eunice
i
shall
go
and
congratulate
them
of
course
and
the
catastrophe
how
dramatic
of
helena
gracedieu
i
warned
selina
that
miss
helena
would
end
badly
to
tell
the
truth
she
frightened
me
i
don
t
deny
that
i
am
a
mischievous
woman
when
i
find
myself
affronted
quite
capable
of
taking
my
revenge
in
my
own
small
spiteful
way
but
poison
and
murder
ah
the
frightful
subject
let
us
drop
it
and
talk
of
something
that
doesn
t
make
my
hair
it
s
really
my
own
hair
stand
on
end
has
selina
told
you
that
i
have
got
rid
of
my
charming
husband
on
easy
pecuniary
terms
oh
you
know
that
very
well
i
will
tell
you
something
that
you
don
t
know
mr
governor
i
have
found
you
may
i
venture
to
ask
how
when
i
guessed
which
was
which
of
those
two
girls
she
answered
and
guessed
wrong
you
deliberately
encouraged
the
mistake
very
clever
but
you
overdid
it
from
that
moment
though
i
kept
it
to
myself
i
began
to
fear
i
might
be
wrong
do
you
remember
low
lanes
my
dear
sir
a
charming
old
church
i
have
had
another
consultation
with
my
lawyer
his
questions
led
me
into
mentioning
how
it
happened
that
i
heard
of
low
lanes
after
looking
again
at
his
memorandum
of
the
birth
advertised
in
the
newspaper
without
naming
the
place
he
proposed
trying
the
church
register
at
low
lanes
need
i
tell
you
the
result
i
know
as
well
as
you
do
that
philip
has
married
the
adopted
child
he
has
had
a
who
was
hanged
and
what
is
more
he
has
the
honor
through
his
late
father
of
being
otherwise
connected
with
the
murderess
by
marriage
as
his
aunt
bewilderment
and
dismay
deprived
me
of
my
presence
of
mind
how
did
you
discover
that
i
was
foolish
enough
to
ask
do
you
remember
when
i
brought
the
baby
to
the
prison
she
said
the
father
as
i
mentioned
at
the
time
had
been
a
dear
and
valued
friend
of
mine
no
person
could
be
better
qualified
to
tell
me
who
had
married
his
wife
s
sister
if
that
lady
had
been
living
i
should
never
have
been
troubled
with
the
charge
of
the
child
any
more
questions
only
one
is
philip
to
hear
of
this
oh
for
shame
i
don
t
deny
that
philip
insulted
me
grossly
in
one
way
and
that
philip
s
late
father
insulted
me
grossly
in
another
way
but
mamma
tenbruggen
is
a
christian
she
returns
good
for
evil
and
wouldn
t
for
the
world
disturb
the
connubial
felicity
of
and
philip
the
moment
the
woman
was
out
of
my
house
i
sent
a
telegram
to
philip
to
say
that
he
might
expect
to
see
me
that
night
i
caught
the
last
train
in
the
evening
and
i
sat
down
to
supper
with
those
two
harmless
young
creatures
knowing
i
must
prepare
the
husband
for
what
threatened
them
and
weakly
deferring
it
when
i
found
myself
in
their
presence
until
the
next
day
eunice
was
in
some
degree
answerable
for
this
hesitation
on
my
part
no
one
could
look
at
her
husband
and
fail
to
see
that
he
was
a
supremely
happy
man
but
i
detected
signs
of
care
in
the
wife
s
face
before
breakfast
the
next
morning
i
was
out
on
the
beach
trying
to
decide
how
the
inevitable
disclosure
might
be
made
eunice
joined
me
now
when
we
were
alone
i
asked
if
she
was
really
and
completely
happy
quietly
and
sadly
she
answered
not
i
hardly
knew
what
to
say
my
face
must
have
expressed
disappointment
and
surprise
i
shall
never
be
quite
happy
she
resumed
till
i
know
what
it
is
that
you
kept
from
me
on
that
memorable
day
i
don
t
like
having
a
secret
from
my
husband
though
it
is
not
remember
your
promise
i
said
i
don
t
forget
it
she
answered
i
can
only
wish
that
my
promise
would
keep
back
the
thoughts
that
come
to
me
in
spite
of
what
thoughts
there
is
something
as
i
fear
in
the
story
of
my
parents
which
you
are
afraid
to
confide
to
me
why
did
gracedieu
allow
me
to
believe
and
leave
everybody
to
believe
that
i
was
his
own
child
my
dear
i
relieved
your
mind
of
those
doubts
on
the
morning
of
your
no
i
was
only
thinking
of
myself
at
that
time
my
mother
the
doubt
of
is
the
doubt
that
torments
me
what
do
you
mean
she
put
her
arm
in
mine
and
held
by
it
with
both
hands
the
she
whispered
do
you
remember
that
dreadful
vision
that
horrid
whispering
temptation
in
the
dead
of
night
it
a
oh
pity
me
i
don
t
know
who
my
mother
was
one
horrid
thought
about
her
is
a
burden
on
my
mind
if
she
was
a
good
woman
you
who
love
me
would
surely
have
made
me
happy
by
speaking
of
her
those
words
decided
me
at
last
could
she
suffer
more
than
she
had
suffered
already
if
i
trusted
her
with
the
truth
i
ran
the
risk
there
was
a
time
of
silence
that
filled
me
with
terror
the
interval
passed
she
took
my
hand
and
put
it
to
her
heart
does
it
beat
as
if
i
was
frightened
she
asked
no
it
was
beating
calmly
does
it
relieve
your
anxiety
it
told
me
that
i
had
not
surprised
her
that
unforgotten
vision
of
the
night
had
prepared
her
for
the
worst
after
the
time
when
i
had
told
her
that
she
was
an
adopted
child
i
know
i
said
that
those
whispered
temptations
overpowered
you
again
when
you
and
helena
met
on
the
stairs
and
you
forbade
her
to
enter
philip
s
room
and
i
know
that
love
had
conquered
once
more
when
you
were
next
seen
sitting
by
philip
s
bedside
tell
me
have
you
any
misgivings
now
is
there
fear
in
your
heart
of
the
return
of
that
tempting
spirit
in
you
in
the
time
to
come
not
while
philip
lives
there
where
her
love
was
there
her
safety
was
and
she
knew
it
she
suddenly
left
me
i
asked
where
she
was
going
to
tell
philip
was
the
reply
she
was
waiting
for
me
at
the
door
when
i
followed
her
to
the
house
is
it
done
i
said
it
is
done
she
answered
what
did
he
say
he
said
my
darling
if
i
could
be
fonder
of
you
than
ever
i
should
be
fonder
of
you
i
have
been
blamed
for
being
too
ready
to
confide
to
philip
the
precious
trust
of
eunice
s
happiness
if
that
reply
does
not
justify
me
where
is
justification
to
be
found
postscript
later
in
the
day
tenbruggen
arrived
to
offer
her
congratulations
she
asked
for
a
few
minutes
with
philip
alone
as
a
cat
elaborates
her
preparations
for
killing
a
mouse
so
the
human
cat
elaborated
her
preparations
for
killing
philip
s
happiness
he
remained
uninjured
by
her
teeth
and
her
claws
somebody
she
said
has
told
you
of
it
already
and
philip
answered
yes
my
for
some
months
longer
gracedieu
lingered
one
morning
he
said
to
eunice
i
want
to
teach
you
to
knit
sit
by
me
and
see
me
do
his
hands
fell
softly
on
his
lap
his
head
sank
little
by
little
on
her
shoulder
she
could
just
hear
him
whisper
how
pleasant
it
is
to
sleep
never
was
death
s
dreadful
work
more
gently
done
our
married
pair
live
now
on
the
paternal
estate
in
ireland
and
miss
jillgall
reigns
queen
of
domestic
affairs
i
am
still
strong
enough
to
pass
my
autumn
holidays
in
that
pleasant
house
at
times
my
memory
reverts
to
helena
gracedieu
and
to
what
i
discovered
when
i
had
seen
her
diary
how
little
i
knew
of
that
terrible
creature
when
i
first
met
with
her
and
fancied
that
she
had
inherited
her
mother
s
character
it
was
weak
indeed
to
compare
the
mean
vices
of
gracedieu
with
the
diabolical
depravity
of
her
daughter
here
the
doctrine
of
hereditary
transmission
of
moral
qualities
must
own
that
it
has
overlooked
the
fertility
for
growth
of
good
and
for
growth
of
evil
equally
which
is
inherent
in
human
nature
there
are
virtues
that
exalt
us
and
vices
that
degrade
us
whose
mysterious
origin
is
not
in
our
parents
but
in
ourselves
when
i
think
of
helena
i
ask
myself
where
is
the
trace
which
reveals
that
the
first
murder
in
the
world
was
the
product
of
inherited
crime
the
criminal
left
the
prison
on
the
expiration
of
her
sentence
so
secretly
that
it
was
impossible
to
trace
her
some
months
later
miss
jillgall
received
an
illustrated
newspaper
published
in
the
united
states
she
showed
me
one
of
the
portraits
in
it
do
you
recognize
the
illustrious
original
she
asked
with
indignant
emphasis
on
the
last
two
words
i
recognized
helena
now
read
her
new
title
miss
jillgall
continued
i
read
the
reverend
miss
the
biographical
notice
followed
here
is
an
extract
this
eminent
lady
the
victim
of
a
shocking
miscarriage
of
justice
in
england
is
now
the
distinguished
leader
of
a
new
community
in
the
united
states
we
hail
in
her
the
great
intellect
which
asserts
the
superiority
of
woman
over
man
in
the
first
french
revolution
the
attempt
made
by
men
to
found
a
rational
religion
met
with
only
temporary
success
it
was
reserved
for
the
mightier
spirit
of
woman
to
lay
the
foundations
more
firmly
and
to
dedicate
one
of
the
noblest
edifices
in
this
city
to
the
worship
of
pure
reason

wish
for
further
information

do
well

provide
themselves
with

well
