de
balzac
translated

prescott
wormeley
dedication
to
mademoiselle
anna
hanska
dear
child
you
the
joy
of
the
household
you
whose
pink
or
white
pelerine
flutters
in
summer
among
the
groves
of
wierzschovnia
like
a
followed
by
the
tender
eyes
of
your
father
and
your
mother
how
can
i
dedicate
to
a
story
full
of
melancholy
and
yet
ought
not
sorrows
to
be
spoken
of
to
a
young
girl
idolized
as
you
are
since
the
day
may
come
when
your
sweet
hands
will
be
called
to
minister
to
them
it
is
so
difficult
anna
to
find
in
the
history
of
our
manners
and
morals
a
subject
that
is
worthy
of
your
eyes
that
no
choice
has
been
left
me
but
perhaps
you
will
be
made
to
feel
how
fortunate
your
fate
is
when
you
read
the
story
sent
to
you
by
your
old
friend
de
balzac
pierrette
i
the
lorrains
at
the
dawn
of
an
october
day
in
a
young
fellow
about
sixteen
years
of
age
whose
clothing
proclaimed
what
modern
phraseology
so
insolently
calls
a
proletary
was
standing
in
a
small
square
of
lower
provins
at
that
early
hour
he
could
examine
without
being
observed
the
various
houses
surrounding
the
open
space
which
was
oblong
in
form
the
mills
along
the
river
were
already
working
the
whirr
of
their
wheels
repeated
by
the
echoes
of
the
upper
town
in
the
keen
air
and
sparkling
clearness
of
the
early
morning
only
intensified
the
general
silence
so
that
the
wheels
of
a
diligence
could
be
heard
a
league
away
along
the
highroad
the
two
longest
sides
of
the
square
separated
by
an
avenue
of
lindens
were
built
in
the
simple
style
which
expresses
so
well
the
peaceful
and
life
of
the
bourgeoisie
no
signs
of
commerce
were
to
be
seen
on
the
other
hand
the
luxurious
of
the
rich
were
few
and
those
few
turned
seldom
on
their
hinges
excepting
that
of
monsieur
martener
a
physician
whose
profession
obliged
him
to
keep
a
cabriolet
and
to
use
it
a
few
of
the
were
covered
by
grape
vines
others
by
roses
climbing
to
the
windows
through
which
they
wafted
the
fragrance
of
their
scattered
bunches
one
end
of
the
square
enters
the
main
street
of
the
lower
town
the
gardens
of
which
reach
to
the
bank
of
one
of
the
two
rivers
which
water
the
valley
of
provins
the
other
end
of
the
square
enters
a
street
which
runs
parallel
to
the
main
street
at
the
latter
which
was
also
the
quietest
end
of
the
square
the
young
workman
recognized
the
house
of
which
he
was
in
search
which
showed
a
front
of
white
stone
grooved
in
lines
to
represent
courses
windows
with
closed
gray
blinds
and
slender
iron
balconies
decorated
with
rosettes
painted
yellow
above
the
ground
floor
and
the
first
floor
were
three
dormer
windows
projecting
from
a
slate
roof
on
the
peak
of
the
central
one
was
a
new
this
modern
innovation
represented
a
hunter
in
the
attitude
of
shooting
a
hare
the
front
door
was
reached
by
three
stone
steps
on
one
side
of
this
door
a
leaden
pipe
discharged
the
into
a
small
showing
the
whereabouts
of
the
kitchen
on
the
other
side
were
two
windows
carefully
closed
by
gray
shutters
in
which
were
openings
cut
to
admit
the
light
these
windows
seemed
to
be
those
of
the
in
the
elevation
gained
by
the
three
steps
were
to
the
cellar
closed
by
painted
iron
shutters
fantastically
cut
in
everything
was
new
in
this
repaired
and
restored
house
the
look
of
which
contrasted
with
the
exteriors
of
all
the
other
houses
an
observer
would
instantly
perceive
the
paltry
taste
and
perfect
of
the
retired
petty
shopkeeper
the
young
man
looked
at
these
details
with
an
expression
of
pleasure
that
seemed
to
have
something
rather
sad
in
it
his
eyes
roved
from
the
kitchen
to
the
roof
with
a
motion
that
showed
a
deliberate
purpose
the
rosy
glow
of
the
rising
sun
fell
on
a
calico
curtain
at
one
of
the
garret
windows
the
others
being
without
that
luxury
as
he
caught
sight
of
it
the
young
fellow
s
face
brightened
gaily
he
stepped
back
a
little
way
leaned
against
a
linden
and
sang
in
the
drawling
tone
peculiar
to
the
west
of
france
the
following
breton
ditty
published
by
bruguiere
a
composer
to
whom
we
are
indebted
for
many
charming
melodies
in
brittany
the
young
villagers
sing
this
song
to
all
couples
on
their
we
ve
come
to
wish
you
happiness
in
marriage
to
m
sieur
your
husband
as
well
as
to
you
you
have
just
been
bound
madam
la
mariee
with
bonds
of
gold
that
only
death
unbinds
you
will
go
no
more
to
balls
or
gay
assemblies
you
must
stay
at
home
while
we
shall
go
have
you
thought
well
how
you
are
pledged
to
be
true
to
your
spouse
and
love
him
like
yourself
receive
these
flowers
our
hands
do
now
present
you
alas
your
fleeting
honors
will
fade
as
this
native
air
as
sweet
as
that
adapted
by
chateaubriand
to
soeur
te
sung
in
this
little
town
of
the
brie
district
must
have
been
to
the
ears
of
a
breton
maiden
the
touchstone
of
imperious
memories
so
faithfully
does
it
picture
the
manners
and
customs
the
surroundings
and
the
heartiness
of
her
noble
old
land
where
a
sort
of
melancholy
reigns
hardly
to
be
defined
caused
perhaps
by
the
aspect
of
life
in
brittany
which
is
deeply
touching
this
power
of
awakening
a
world
of
grave
and
sweet
and
tender
memories
by
a
familiar
and
sometimes
lively
ditty
is
the
privilege
of
those
popular
songs
which
are
the
superstitions
of
music
if
we
may
use
the
word
superstition
as
signifying
all
that
remains
after
the
ruin
of
a
people
all
that
survives
their
revolutions
as
he
finished
the
first
couple
the
singer
who
never
took
his
eyes
from
the
attic
curtain
saw
no
signs
of
life
while
he
sang
the
second
the
curtain
stirred
when
the
words
receive
these
flowers
were
sung
a
youthful
face
appeared
a
white
hand
cautiously
opened
the
casement
and
a
girl
made
a
sign
with
her
head
to
the
singer
as
he
ended
with
the
melancholy
thought
of
the
simple
verses
alas
your
fleeting
honors
will
fade
as
to
her
the
young
workman
suddenly
showed
drawing
it
from
within
his
jacket
a
yellow
flower
very
common
in
brittany
and
sometimes
to
be
found
in
la
brie
where
however
it
is
rare
the
furze
or
broom
is
it
really
you
brigaut
said
the
girl
in
a
low
voice
yes
pierrette
yes
i
am
in
paris
i
have
started
to
make
my
way
but
i
m
ready
to
settle
here
near
just
then
the
fastening
of
a
window
creaked
in
a
room
on
the
first
floor
directly
below
pierrette
s
attic
the
girl
showed
the
utmost
terror
and
said
to
brigaut
quickly
run
away
the
lad
jumped
like
a
frightened
frog
to
a
bend
in
the
street
caused
by
the
projection
of
a
mill
just
where
the
square
opens
into
the
main
thoroughfare
but
in
spite
of
his
agility
his
shoes
echoed
on
the
stones
with
a
sound
easily
distinguished
from
the
music
of
the
mill
and
no
doubt
heard
by
the
person
who
opened
the
window
that
person
was
a
woman
no
man
would
have
torn
himself
from
the
comfort
of
a
morning
nap
to
listen
to
a
minstrel
in
a
jacket
none
but
a
maid
awakes
to
songs
of
love
not
only
was
this
woman
a
maid
but
she
was
an
old
maid
when
she
had
opened
her
blinds
with
the
furtive
motion
of
the
bat
she
looked
in
all
directions
but
saw
nothing
and
only
heard
faintly
the
flying
footfalls
of
the
lad
can
there
be
anything
more
dreadful
than
the
matutinal
apparition
of
an
ugly
old
maid
at
her
window
of
all
the
grotesque
sights
which
amuse
the
eyes
of
travellers
in
country
towns
that
is
the
most
unpleasant
it
is
too
repulsive
to
laugh
at
this
particular
old
maid
whose
ear
was
so
keen
was
denuded
of
all
the
adventitious
aids
of
whatever
kind
which
she
employed
as
embellishments
her
false
front
and
her
collarette
were
lacking
she
wore
that
horrible
little
bag
of
black
silk
on
which
old
women
insist
on
covering
their
skulls
and
it
was
now
revealed
beneath
the
which
had
been
pushed
aside
in
sleep
this
rumpled
condition
gave
a
menacing
expression
to
the
head
such
as
painters
bestow
on
witches
the
temples
ears
and
nape
of
the
neck
were
disclosed
in
all
their
withered
horror
the
wrinkles
being
marked
in
scarlet
lines
that
contrasted
with
the
white
of
the
which
was
tied
round
her
neck
by
a
narrow
tape
the
gaping
of
this
garment
revealed
a
breast
to
be
likened
only
to
that
of
an
old
peasant
woman
who
cares
nothing
about
her
personal
ugliness
the
fleshless
arm
was
like
a
stick
on
which
a
bit
of
stuff
was
hung
seen
at
her
window
this
spinster
seemed
tall
from
the
length
and
angularity
of
her
face
which
recalled
the
exaggerated
proportions
of
certain
swiss
heads
the
character
of
their
countenance
the
features
being
marked
by
a
total
want
of
harmony
was
that
of
hardness
in
the
lines
sharpness
in
the
tones
while
an
unfeeling
spirit
pervading
all
would
have
filled
a
physiognomist
with
disgust
these
characteristics
fully
visible
at
this
moment
were
usually
modified
in
public
by
a
sort
of
commercial
smile
a
bourgeois
smirk
which
mimicked
so
that
persons
meeting
with
this
old
maid
might
very
well
take
her
for
a
kindly
woman
she
owned
the
house
on
shares
with
her
brother
the
brother
was
sleeping
so
tranquilly
in
his
own
chamber
that
the
orchestra
of
the
could
not
have
awakened
him
wonderful
as
its
diapason
is
said
to
be
the
old
maid
stretched
her
neck
out
of
the
window
twisted
it
and
raised
her
cold
little
eyes
with
their
short
lashes
set
in
lids
that
were
always
rather
swollen
to
the
attic
window
endeavoring
to
see
pierrette
perceiving
the
uselessness
of
that
attempt
she
retreated
into
her
room
with
a
movement
like
that
of
a
tortoise
which
draws
in
its
head
after
protruding
it
from
its
carapace
the
blinds
were
then
closed
and
the
silence
of
the
street
was
unbroken
except
by
peasants
coming
in
from
the
country
or
very
early
persons
moving
about
when
there
is
an
old
maid
in
a
house
are
unnecessary
not
the
slightest
event
can
occur
that
she
does
not
see
and
comment
upon
and
pursue
to
its
utmost
consequences
the
foregoing
trifling
circumstance
was
therefore
destined
to
give
rise
to
grave
suppositions
and
to
open
the
way
for
one
of
those
obscure
dramas
which
take
place
in
families
and
are
none
the
less
terrible
because
they
are
secret
if
indeed
we
may
apply
the
word
drama
to
such
domestic
occurrences
pierrette
did
not
go
back
to
bed
to
her
brigaut
s
arrival
was
an
immense
event
during
the
night
that
eden
of
the
wretched
she
escaped
the
vexations
and
she
bore
during
the
day
like
the
hero
of
a
ballad
german
or
russian
i
forget
which
her
sleep
seemed
to
her
the
happy
life
her
waking
hours
a
bad
dream
she
had
just
had
her
only
pleasurable
waking
in
three
years
the
memories
of
her
childhood
had
sung
their
melodious
ditties
in
her
soul
the
first
couplet
was
heard
in
a
dream
the
second
made
her
spring
out
of
bed
at
the
third
she
doubted
her
ears
the
sorrowful
are
all
disciples
of
saint
thomas
but
when
the
fourth
was
sung
standing
in
her
with
bare
feet
by
the
window
she
recognized
brigaut
the
companion
of
her
childhood
ah
yes
it
was
truly
the
square
jacket
with
the
bobtails
the
pockets
of
which
stuck
out
at
the
hips
the
jacket
of
blue
cloth
which
is
classic
in
brittany
there
too
were
the
waistcoat
of
printed
cotton
the
linen
shirt
fastened
by
a
gold
heart
the
large
rolling
collar
the
earrings
the
stout
shoes
the
trousers
of
drilling
unevenly
colored
by
the
various
lengths
of
the
warp
in
short
all
those
humble
strong
and
durable
things
which
make
the
apparel
of
the
breton
peasantry
the
big
buttons
of
white
horn
which
fastened
the
jacket
made
the
girl
s
heart
beat
when
she
saw
the
bunch
of
broom
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
then
a
dreadful
fear
drove
back
into
her
heart
the
happy
memories
that
were
budding
there
she
thought
her
cousin
sleeping
in
the
room
beneath
her
might
have
heard
the
noise
she
made
in
jumping
out
of
bed
and
running
to
the
window
the
fear
was
just
the
old
maid
was
coming
and
she
made
brigaut
the
terrified
sign
which
the
lad
obeyed
without
the
least
understanding
it
such
instinctive
submission
to
a
girl
s
bidding
shows
one
of
those
innocent
and
absolute
affections
which
appear
from
century
to
century
on
this
earth
where
they
blossom
like
the
aloes
of
isola
bella
twice
or
thrice
in
a
hundred
years
whoever
had
seen
the
lad
as
he
ran
away
would
have
loved
the
ingenuous
chivalry
of
his
most
ingenuous
feeling
jacques
brigaut
was
worthy
of
pierrette
lorrain
who
was
just
fifteen
two
children
pierrette
could
not
keep
from
crying
as
she
watched
his
flight
in
the
terror
her
gesture
had
conveyed
to
him
then
she
sat
down
in
a
shabby
armchair
placed
before
a
little
table
above
which
hung
a
mirror
she
rested
her
elbows
on
the
table
put
her
head
in
her
hands
and
sat
thinking
for
an
hour
calling
to
memory
the
marais
the
village
of
the
perilous
voyages
on
a
pond
in
a
boat
untied
for
her
from
an
old
willow
by
little
jacques
then
the
old
faces
of
her
grandfather
and
grandmother
the
sufferings
of
her
mother
and
the
handsome
face
of
major
brigaut
in
short
the
whole
of
her
careless
childhood
it
was
all
a
dream
a
luminous
joy
on
the
gloomy
background
of
the
present
her
beautiful
chestnut
hair
escaped
in
disorder
from
her
cap
rumpled
in
sleep
a
cambric
cap
with
ruffles
which
she
had
made
herself
on
each
side
of
her
forehead
were
little
ringlets
escaping
from
gray
from
the
back
of
her
head
hung
a
heavy
braid
of
hair
that
was
half
unplaited
the
excessive
whiteness
of
her
face
betrayed
that
terrible
malady
of
girlhood
which
goes
by
the
name
of
chlorosis
deprives
the
body
of
its
natural
colors
destroys
the
appetite
and
shows
a
disordered
state
of
the
organism
the
waxy
tones
were
in
all
the
visible
parts
of
her
flesh
the
neck
and
shoulders
explained
by
their
blanched
paleness
the
wasted
arms
flung
forward
and
crossed
upon
the
table
her
feet
seemed
enervated
shrunken
from
illness
her
came
only
to
her
knees
and
showed
the
flaccid
muscles
the
blue
veins
the
impoverished
flesh
of
the
legs
the
cold
to
which
she
paid
no
heed
turned
her
lips
violet
and
a
sad
smile
drawing
up
the
corners
of
a
sensitive
mouth
showed
teeth
that
were
white
as
ivory
and
quite
small
pretty
transparent
teeth
in
keeping
with
the
delicate
ears
the
rather
sharp
but
dainty
nose
and
the
general
outline
of
her
face
which
in
spite
of
its
roundness
was
lovely
all
the
animation
of
this
charming
face
was
in
the
eyes
the
iris
of
which
brown
like
spanish
tobacco
and
flecked
with
black
shone
with
golden
reflections
round
pupils
that
were
brilliant
and
intense
pierrette
was
made
to
be
gay
but
she
was
sad
her
lost
gaiety
was
still
to
be
seen
in
the
vivacious
forms
of
the
eye
in
the
ingenuous
grace
of
her
brow
in
the
smooth
curve
of
her
chin
the
long
eyelashes
lay
upon
the
made
prominent
by
suffering
the
paleness
of
her
face
which
was
unnaturally
white
made
the
lines
and
all
the
details
infinitely
pure
the
ear
alone
was
a
little
masterpiece
of
modelling
in
marble
you
might
say
pierrette
suffered
in
many
ways
perhaps
you
would
like
to

of
madame

owners
of

auffray
her
husband
had
married
at
the
age
of
eighteen
his
second
marriage
took
place
when
he
was
nearly
by
the
first
he
had
an
only
daughter
very
plain
who
was
married
at
sixteen
to
an
innkeeper
of
provins
named
rogron
by
his
second
marriage
the
worthy
auffray
had
another
daughter
but
this
one
was
charming
there
was
of
course
an
enormous
difference
in
the
ages
of
these
daughters
the
one
by
the
first
marriage
was
fifty
years
old
when
the
second
child
was
born
by
this
time
the
eldest
madame

had
two
children
the
youngest
daughter
of

married
at
eighteen
to
a
man

at

age
of
without
having
found
time
to

his
property
was
administered
by
his
daughter
madame
rogron
and
her
husband
so
completely
in
their
own
interests
that
nothing
remained
for
the
old

lived
in
on

and

was
only
at
the
time
of
her

death
like
many
widows
she
came
to
the
unwise
decision
of
remarrying
she
sold
the
house
and
land
to
her
madame
rogron
and
married
a
young
physician
named
neraud
who
wasted
her
whole
fortune
she
died
of
grief
and
misery
two
years
later
thus
the
share
of
her
father
s
property
which

to

come
to

disappeared
almost
entirely

reduced

killed
at

of
montereau
leaving
his

of

scarcely

the

of

the

of

and
his
young

was
small
delicate
and
weakly
the
damp
climate
of
the
marais
did
not
agree
with
her
but
her
husband
s
family
persuaded
her
in
order
to
keep
her
with
them
that
in
no
other
quarter
of
the
world
could
she
find
a
more
healthy
region
she
was
so
petted
and
tenderly
cared
for
that
her
death
when
it
came
brought
nothing
but
honor
to
the
old
lorrains
some
persons
declared
that
brigaut
an
old
vendeen
one
of
those
men
of
iron
who
served
under
charette
under
mercier
under
the
marquis
de
montauran
and
the
baron
du
guenic
in
the
wars
against
the
republic
counted
for
a
good
deal
in
the
willingness
of
the
younger
madame
lorrain
to
remain
in
the
marais
if
it
were
so
his
soul
must
have
been
a
truly
loving
and
devoted
one
all
saw
him
he
was
called
respectfully
major
brigaut
the
grade
he
had
held
in
the
catholic
army
spending
his
days
and
his
evenings
in
the
lorrains
parlor
beside
the
window
of
the
imperial

the
curate
of
made
certain
representations
to
old
madame
lorrain
begging
her
to
persuade
her
to
marry
brigaut
and
promising
to
have
the
major
appointed
justice
of
peace
for
the
canton
of
through
the
influence
of
the
vicomte
de
kergarouet
the
death
of
the
poor
young
woman
put
an
end
to
the
matter
pierrette
was
left
in
charge
of
her
grandparents
who
owed
her
four
hundred
francs
a
year
interest
on
the
little
property
placed
in
their
hands
this
small
sum
was
now
applied
to
her
maintenance
the
old
people
who
were
growing
less
and
less
fit
for
business
soon
found
themselves
confronted
by
an
active
and
capable
competitor
against
whom
they
said
hard
things
all
the
while
doing
nothing
to
defeat
him
major
brigaut
their
friend
and
adviser
died
six
months
after
his
friend
the
younger
madame
lorrain
perhaps
of
grief
perhaps
of
his
wounds
of
which
he
had
received
like
a
sound
merchant
the
competitor
set
about
ruining
his
adversaries
in
order
to
get
rid
of
all
rivalry
with
his
connivance
the
lorrains
borrowed
money
on
notes
which
they
were
unable
to
meet
and
which
drove
them
in
their
old
days
into
bankruptcy
pierrette
s
claim
upon
the
house
in
nantes
was
superseded
by
the
legal
rights
of
her
grandmother
who
enforced
them
to
secure
the
daily
bread
of
her
poor
husband
the
house
was
sold
for
nine
thousand
five
hundred
francs
of
which
one
thousand
five
hundred
went
for
costs
the
remaining
eight
thousand
came
to
madame
lorain
who
lived
upon
the
income
of
them
in
a
sort
of
almshouse
at
nantes
like
that
of
in
paris
called
where
the
two
old
people
had
bed
and
board
for
a
humble
payment
as
it
was
impossible
to
keep
pierrette
their
ruined
little
granddaughter
with
them
the
old
lorrains
bethought
themselves
of
her
uncle
and
aunt
rogron
in
provins
to
whom
they
wrote
these
rogrons
were
dead
the
letter
might
therefore
have
easily
been
lost
but
if
anything
here
below
can
take
the
place
of
providence
it
is
the
post
postal
spirit
incomparably
above
public
spirit
exceeds
in
brilliancy
of
resource
and
invention
the
ablest
when
the
post
gets
hold
of
a
letter
worth
to
it
from
three
to
ten
sous
and
does
not
immediately
know
where
to
find
the
person
to
whom
that
letter
is
addressed
it
displays
a
financial
anxiety
only
to
be
met
with
in
very
pertinacious
creditors
the
post
goes
and
comes
and
ferrets
through
all
the
departments
difficulties
only
arouse
the
genius
of
the
clerks
who
may
really
be
called
and
who
set
about
to
search
for
that
unknown
human
being
with
as
much
ardor
as
the
mathematicians
of
the
bureau
give
to
longitudes
they
literally
ransack
the
whole
kingdom
at
the
first
ray
of
hope
all
the
in
paris
are
alert
sometimes
the
receiver
of
a
missing
letter
is
amazed
at
the
network
of
scrawled
directions
which
covers
both
back
and
front
of
the
missive
glorious
vouchers
for
the
administrative
persistency
with
which
the
post
has
been
at
work
if
a
man
undertook
what
the
post
accomplishes
he
would
lose
ten
thousand
francs
in
travel
time
and
money
to
recover
ten
sous
the
letter
of
the
old
lorrains
addressed
to
monsieur
rogron
of
provins
who
had
then
been
dead
a
year
was
conveyed
by
the
post
in
due
time
to
monsieur
rogron
son
of
the
deceased
a
mercer
in
the
rue
in
paris
and
this
is
where
the
postal
spirit
obtains
its
greatest
triumph
an
heir
is
always
more
or
less
anxious
to
know
if
he
has
picked
up
every
scrap
of
his
inheritance
if
he
has
not
overlooked
a
credit
or
a
trunk
of
old
clothes
the
treasury
knows
that
a
letter
addressed
to
the
late
rogron
at
provins
was
certain
to
pique
the
curiosity
of
rogron
or
mademoiselle
rogron
the
heirs
in
paris
out
of
that
human
interest
the
treasury
was
able
to
earn
sixty
centimes
these
rogrons
toward
whom
the
old
lorrains
though
dreading
to
part
with
their
dear
little
granddaughter
stretched
their
supplicating
hands
became
in
this
way
and
most
unexpectedly
the
masters
of
pierrette
s
destiny
it
is
therefore
indispensable
to
explain
both
their
antecedents
and
their
character
ii
the
rogrons
pere
rogron
that
innkeeper
of
provins
to
whom
old
auffray
had
married
his
daughter
by
his
first
wife
was
an
individual
with
an
inflamed
face
a
veiny
nose
and
cheeks
on
which
bacchus
had
drawn
his
scarlet
and
bulbous
though
short
fat
and
with
stout
legs
and
thick
hands
he
was
gifted
with
the
shrewdness
of
the
swiss
innkeepers
whom
he
resembled
certainly
he
was
not
handsome
and
his
wife
looked
like
him
never
was
a
couple
better
matched
rogron
liked
good
living
and
to
be
waited
upon
by
pretty
girls
he
belonged
to
the
class
of
egoists
whose
behavior
is
brutal
he
gave
way
to
his
vices
and
did
their
will
openly
in
the
face
of
israel
grasping
selfish
without
decency
and
always
gratifying
his
own
fancies
he
devoured
his
earnings
until
the
day
when
his
teeth
failed
him
selfishness
stayed
by
him
in
his
old
days
he
sold
his
inn
collected
as
we
have
seen
all
he
could
of
his
late
s
property
and
went
to
live
in
the
little
house
in
the
square
of
provins
bought
for
a
trifle
from
the
widow
of
old
auffray
pierrette
s
grandmother
rogron
and
his
wife
had
about
two
thousand
francs
a
year
from
lots
of
land
in
the
neighborhood
of
provins
and
from
the
sale
of
their
inn
for
twenty
thousand
old
auffray
s
house
though
out
of
repair
was
inhabited
just
as
it
was
by
the
rogrons
old
rats
like
wrack
and
ruin
rogron
himself
took
to
horticulture
and
spent
his
savings
in
enlarging
the
garden
he
carried
it
to
the
river
s
edge
between
two
walls
and
built
a
sort
of
stone
embankment
across
the
end
where
aquatic
nature
left
to
herself
displayed
the
charms
of
her
flora
in
the
early
years
of
their
marriage
the
rogrons
had
a
son
and
a
daughter
both
hideous
for
such
human
beings
degenerate
put
out
to
nurse
at
a
low
price
these
luckless
children
came
home
in
due
time
after
the
worst
of
village
training
allowed
to
cry
for
hours
after
their
who
worked
in
the
fields
leaving
them
shut
up
to
scream
for
her
in
one
of
those
damp
dark
low
rooms
which
serve
as
homes
for
the
french
peasantry
treated
thus
the
features
of
the
children
coarsened
their
voices
grew
harsh
they
mortified
their
mother
s
vanity
and
that
made
her
strive
to
correct
their
bad
habits
by
a
sternness
which
the
severity
of
their
father
converted
through
comparison
to
kindness
as
a
general
thing
they
were
left
to
run
loose
about
the
stables
and
courtyards
of
the
inn
or
the
streets
of
the
town
sometimes
they
were
whipped
sometimes
they
were
sent
to
get
rid
of
them
to
their
grandfather
auffray
who
did
not
like
them
the
injustice
the
rogrons
declared
the
old
man
did
to
their
children
justified
them
to
their
own
minds
in
taking
the
greater
part
of
the
old
scoundrel
s
property
however
rogron
did
send
his
son
to
school
and
did
buy
him
a
man
one
of
his
own
cartmen
to
save
him
from
the
conscription
as
soon
as
his
daughter
sylvie
was
thirteen
he
sent
her
to
paris
to
make
her
way
as
apprentice
in
a
shop
two
years
later
he
despatched
his
son
to
the
same
career
when
his
friends
the
carriers
and
those
who
frequented
the
inn
asked
him
what
he
meant
to
do
with
his
children
pere
rogron
explained
his
system
with
a
conciseness
which
in
view
of
that
of
most
fathers
had
the
merit
of
frankness
when
they
are
old
enough
to
understand
me
i
shall
give
em
a
kick
and
say
go
and
make
your
own
way
in
the
world
he
replied
emptying
his
glass
and
wiping
his
lips
with
the
back
of
his
hand
then
he
winked
at
his
questioner
with
a
knowing
look
hey
hey
they
are
no
greater
fools
than
i
was
he
added
my
father
gave
me
three
kicks
i
shall
only
give
them
one
he
put
one
louis
into
my
hand
i
shall
put
ten
in

therefore
they

be
better
off
than
i
was
that
s
the
way
to
do
after
i
m
gone
what
s
left
will
be
theirs
the
notaries
can
find
them
and
give
it
to
them
what
nonsense
to
bother
one

self
about

i
began
as
a

but
that
didn

prevent
me
marrying
the
daughter
of
that
old
scoundrel
sylvie
rogron
was
sent
with
six
hundred
francs
for
her
board
as
apprentice
to
certain
shopkeepers
originally
from
provins
and
now
settled
in
paris
in
the
rue
two
years
later
she
was
at
par
as
they
say
she
earned
her
own
living
at
any
rate
her
parents
paid
nothing
for
her
that
is
what
is
called
being
at
par
in
the
rue
sylvie

a
salary
of
four
hundred
francs
at
nineteen
years
of

demoiselle
in

the

of

of
one
of

in

when

and

met
on

and
which
they
passed
in

amusements
they
dined
out
of
paris
and
went
to
meudon
belleville
or
vincennes
towards
the
close
of
the
year
they
clubbed
their
savings
amounting
to
about
twenty
thousand
francs
earned
by
the
sweat
of
their
brows

bought
of

master
and
both
in
after
five
years
experience
competition
became
so
fierce
that
it
was
all
the
brother

could
do
to
carry
on
the
business
and
maintain
its
reputation
though
sylvie
was
at
this
time
scarcely
forty
her
natural
ugliness
combined
with
hard
work
and
a
certain
crabbed
look
caused
as
much
by
the
conformation
of
her
features
as
by
her
cares
made
her
seem
like
a
woman
of
fifty
at
jerome
rogron
presented
to
the
eyes
of
his
customers
the
silliest
face
that
ever
looked
over
a
counter
his
retreating
forehead
flattened
by
fatigue
was
marked
by
three
long
wrinkles
his
grizzled
hair
cut
close
expressed
in
some
indefinable
way
the
stupidity
of
a
animal
the
glance
of
his
bluish
eyes
had
neither
flame
nor
thought
in
it
his
round
flat
face
excited
no
sympathy
nor
even
a
laugh
on
the
lips
of
those
who
might
be
examining
the
varieties
of
the
parisian
species
on
the
contrary
it
saddened
them
he
was
like
his
father
short
and
fat
but
his
figure
lacked
the
latter
s
brutal
obesity
and
showed
instead
an
almost
ridiculous
debility
his
father
s
high
color
was
changed
in
him
to
the
livid
flabbiness
peculiar
to
persons
who
live
in
close
or
in
those
railed
cages
called
forever
tying
up
bundles
receiving
and
making
change
snarling
at
the
clerks
and
repeating
the
same
old
speeches
to
customers
the
small
amount
of
brains
possessed
by
the
brother
and
sister
had
been
wholly
absorbed
in
maintaining
their
business
in
getting
and
keeping
money
and
in
learning
the
special
laws
and
usages
of
the
parisian
market
thread
needles
ribbons
pins
buttons
tailors
furnishings
in
short
the
enormous
quantity
of
things
which
go
to
make
up
a
mercer
s
stock
had
taken
all
their
capacity
outside
of
their
business
they
knew
absolutely
nothing
they
were
even
ignorant
of
paris
to
them
the
great
city
was
merely
a
region
spreading
around
the
rue
their
narrow
natures
could
see
no
field
except
the
shop
they
were
clever
enough
in
nagging
their
clerks
and
their
young
women
and
in
proving
them
to
blame
their
happiness
lay
in
seeing
all
hands
busy
at
the
counters
exhibiting
the
merchandise
and
folding
it
up
again
when
they
heard
the
six
or
eight
voices
of
the
young
men
and
women
glibly
gabbling
the
consecrated
phrases
by
which
clerks
reply
to
the
remarks
of
customers
the
day
was
fine
to
them
the
weather
beautiful
but
on
the
really
fine
days
when
the
blue
of
the
heavens
brightened
all
paris
and
the
parisians
walked
about
to
enjoy
themselves
and
cared
for
no
goods
but
those
they
carried
on
their
back
the
day
was
overcast
to
the
rogrons
bad
weather
for
sales
said
that
pair
of
imbeciles
the
skill
with
which
rogron
could
tie
up
a
parcel
made
him
an
object
of
admiration
to
all
his
apprentices
he
could
fold
and
tie
and
see
all
that
happened
in
the
street
and
in
the
farthest
recesses
of
the
shop
by
the
time
he
handed
the
parcel
to
his
customer
with
a
here
it
is
madame
but
the
poor
fool
would
have
been
ruined
without
his
sister
sylvie
had
and
a
genius
for
trade
she
advised
her
brother
in
their
purchases
and
would
pitilessly
send
him
to
remote
parts
of
france
to
save
a
trifle
of
cost
the
shrewdness
which
all
women
more
or
less
possess
not
being
employed
in
the
service
of
her
heart
had
drifted
into
that
of
speculation
a
business
to
pay
for
that
thought
was
the
mainspring
which
kept
the
machine
going
and
gave
it
an
infernal
activity
rogron
was
really
only
he
understood
nothing
of
his
business
as
a
whole
that
great
motor
of
the
mind
had
failed
in
his
case
to
instruct
him
he
was
often
aghast
when
his
sister
ordered
some
article
to
be
sold
below
cost
foreseeing
the
end
of
its
fashion
later
he
admired
her
idiotically
for
her
cleverness
he
reasoned
neither
ill
nor
well
he
was
simply
incapable
of
reasoning
at
all
but
he
had
the
sense
to
subordinate
himself
to
his
sister
and
he
did
so
from
a
consideration
that
was
outside
of
the
business
she
is
my
elder
he
said
perhaps
an
existence
like
his
always
solitary
reduced
to
the
satisfaction
of
mere
needs
deprived
of
money
and
all
pleasures
in
youth
may
explain
to
physiologists
and
thinkers
the
clownish
expression
of
the
face
the
feebleness
of
mind
the
vacant
silliness
of
the
man
his
sister
had
steadily
prevented
him
from
marrying
afraid
perhaps
to
lose
her
power
over
him
and
seeing
only
a
source
of
expense
and
injury
in
some
woman
who
would
certainly
be
younger
and
undoubtedly
less
ugly
than
herself
silliness
has
two
ways
of
comporting
itself
it
talks
or
is
silent
silent
silliness
can
be
borne
but
rogron
s
silliness
was
loquacious
the
man
had
a
habit
of
chattering
to
his
clerks
explaining
the
minutiae
of
the
business
and
ornamenting
his
talk
with
those
flat
jokes
which
may
be
called
the
chaff
of
shopkeeping
rogron
listened
to
of
course
by
his
subordinates
and
perfectly
satisfied
with
himself
had
come
at
last
into
possession
of
a
phraseology
of
his
own
this
chatterer
believed
himself
an
orator
the
necessity
of
explaining
to
customers
what
they
want
of
guessing
at
their
desires
and
giving
them
desires
for
what
they
do
not
want
exercises
the
tongue
of
all
retail
shopkeepers
the
petty
dealer
acquires
the
faculty
of
uttering
words
and
sentences
in
which
there
is
absolutely
no
meaning
but
which
have
a
marked
success
he
explains
to
his
customers
matters
of
manufacture
that
they
know
nothing
of
that
alone
gives
him
a
passing
superiority
over
them
but
take
him
away
from
his
thousand
and
one
explanations
about
his
thousand
and
one
articles
and
he
is
relatively
to
thought
like
a
fish
out
of
water
in
the
sun
rogron
and
sylvie
two
mechanisms
baptized
by
mistake
did
not
possess
latent
or
active
the
feelings
which
give
life
to
the
heart
their
natures
were
shrivelled
and
harsh
hardened
by
toil
by
privation
by
the
remembrance
of
their
sufferings
during
a
long
and
cruel
apprenticeship
to
life
neither
of
them
complained
of
their
trials
they
were
not
so
much
implacable
as
impracticable
in
their
dealings
with
others
in
misfortune
to
them
virtue
honor
loyalty
all
human
sentiments
consisted
solely
in
the
payment
of
their
bills
irritable
and
irritating
without
feelings
and
sordid
in
their
economy
the
brother
and
sister
bore
a
dreadful
reputation
among
the
other
merchants
of
the
rue
had
it
not
been
for
their
connection
with
provins
where
they
went
three
or
four
times
a
year
when
they
could
close
the
shop
for
a
day
or
two
they
would
have
had
no
clerks
or
young
women
but
old
rogron
their
father
sent
them
all
the
unfortunate
young
people
of
his
neighborhood
whose
parents
wished
to
start
them
in
business
in
paris
he
obtained
these
apprentices
by
boasting
out
of
vanity
of
his
son
s
success
parents
attracted
by
the
prospect
of
their
children
being
and
closely
watched
and
also
by
the
hope
of
their
succeeding
eventually
to
the
business
sent
whichever
child
was
most
in
the
way
at
home
to
the
care
of
the
brother
and
sister
but
no
sooner
had
the
clerks
or
the
young
women
found
a
way
of
escape
from
that
dreadful
establishment
than
they
fled
with
rejoicings
that
increased
the
already
bad
name
of
the
rogrons
new
victims
were
supplied
yearly
by
the
indefatigable
old
father
from
the
time
she
was
fifteen
sylvie
rogron
trained
to
the
simpering
of
a
saleswoman
had
two
faces
the
amiable
face
of
the
seller
the
natural
face
of
a
sour
spinster
her
acquired
countenance
was
a
marvellous
bit
of
mimicry
she
was
all
smiles
her
voice
soft
and
wheedling
gave
a
commercial
charm
to
business
her
real
face
was
that
we
have
already
seen
projecting
from
the
blinds
the
mere
sight
of
her
would
have
put
to
flight
the
most
resolute
cossack
of
much
as
that
horde
were
said
to
like
all
kinds
of
frenchwomen
when
the
letter
from
the
lorrains
reached
the
brother
and
sister
they
were
in
mourning
for
their
father
from
whom
they
inherited
the
house
which
had
been
as
good
as
stolen
from
pierrette
s
grandmother
also
certain
lands
bought
by
their
father
and
certain
moneys
acquired
by
usurious
loans
and
mortgages
to
the
peasantry
whose
bits
of
ground
the
old
drunkard
expected
to
possess
the
yearly
taking
of
stock
was
just
over
the
price
of
the
family
sister
had
at
last
been
paid
in
full
the
rogrons
owned
about
sixty
thousand
francs
worth
of
merchandise
forty
thousand
in
a
bank
or
in
their
and
the
value
of
their
business
sitting
on
a
bench
covered
with
utrecht
velvet
placed
in
a
square
recess
just
behind
their
private
counter
the
counter
of
their
forewoman
being
similar
and
directly
opposite
the
brother
and
sister
consulted
as
to
what
they
should
do
all
retail
shopkeepers
aspire
to
become
members
of
the
bourgeoisie
by
selling
the
of
their
business
the
pair
would
have
over
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
not
counting
the
inheritance
from
their
father
by
placing
their
present
available
property
in
the
public
funds
they
would
each
obtain
about
four
thousand
francs
a
year
and
by
taking
the
proceeds
of
their
business
when
sold
they
could
repair
and
improve
the
house
they
inherited
from
their
father
which
would
thus
be
a
good
investment
they
could
then
go
and
live
in
a
house
of
their
own
in
provins
their
forewoman
was
the
daughter
of
a
rich
farmer
at
donnemarie
burdened
with
nine
children
to
whom
he
had
endeavored
to
give
a
good
start
in
life
being
aware
that
at
his
death
his
property
divided
into
nine
parts
would
be
but
little
for
any
one
of
them
in
five
years
however
the
man
had
lost
seven
children
a
fact
which
made
the
forewoman
so
interesting
that
rogron
had
tried
unsuccessfully
to
get
her
to
marry
him
but
she
showed
an
aversion
for
her
master
which
baffled
his
manoeuvres
besides
mademoiselle
sylvie
was
not
in
favor
of
the
match
in
fact
she
steadily
opposed
her
brother
s
marriage
and
sought
instead
to
make
the
shrewd
young
woman
their
successor
no
passing
observer
can
form
the
least
idea
of
the
cryptogramic
existence
of
a
certain
class
of
shopkeepers
he
looks
at
them
and
asks
himself
on
what
and
why
do
they
live
whence
have
they
come
where
do
they
go
he
is
lost
in
such
questions
but
finds
no
answer
to
them
to
discover
the
false
seed
of
poesy
which
lies
in
those
heads
and
fructifies
in
those
lives
it
is
necessary
to
dig
into
them
and
when
we
do
that
we
soon
come
to
a
thin
subsoil
beneath
the
surface
the
parisian
shopkeeper
nurtures
his
soul
on
some
hope
or
other
more
or
less
attainable
without
which
he
would
doubtless
perish
one
dreams
of
building
or
managing
a
theatre
another
longs
for
the
honors
of
mayoralty
this
one
desires
a
ten
miles
from
paris
with
a
park
which
he
will
adorn
with
statues
of
tinted
plaster
and
fountains
which
squirt
mere
threads
of
water
but
on
which
he
will
spend
a
mint
of
money
others
again
dream
of
distinction
and
a
high
grade
in
the
national
guard
provins
that
terrestrial
paradise
filled
the
brother
and
sister
with
the
fanatical
longings
which
all
the
lovely
towns
of
france
inspire
in
their
inhabitants
let
us
say
it
to
the
glory
of
la
champagne
this
love
is
warranted
provins
one
of
the
most
charming
towns
in
all
france
rivals
frangistan
and
the
valley
of
cashmere
not
only
does
it
contain
the
poesy
of
saadi
the
persian
homer
but
it
offers
many
pharmaceutical
treasures
to
medical
science
the
crusades
brought
roses
from
jericho
to
this
enchanting
valley
where
by
chance
they
gained
new
charms
while
losing
none
of
their
colors
the
provins
roses
are
known
the
world
over
but
provins
is
not
only
the
french
persia
it
is
also
baden
aix
cheltenham
for
it
has
medicinal
springs
this
was
the
spot
which
appeared
from
time
to
time
before
the
eyes
of
the
two
shopkeepers
in
the
muddy
regions
of
after
crossing
the
gray
plains
which
lie
between
la
and
provins
a
desert
and
yet
productive
a
desert
of
wheat
you
reach
a
hill
suddenly
you
behold
at
your
feet
a
town
watered
by
two
rivers
at
the
feet
of
the
rock
on
which
you
stand
stretches
a
verdant
valley
full
of
enchanting
lines
and
fugitive
horizons
if
you
come
from
paris
you
will
pass
through
the
whole
length
of
provins
on
the
everlasting
highroad
of
france
which
here
skirts
the
hillside
and
is
encumbered
with
beggars
and
blind
men
who
will
follow
you
with
their
pitiful
voices
while
you
try
to
examine
the
unexpected
picturesqueness
of
the
region
if
you
come
from
troyes
you
will
approach
the
town
on
the
valley
side
the
chateau
the
old
town
and
its
former
ramparts
are
terraced
on
the
hillside
the
new
town
is
below
they
go
by
the
names
of
upper
and
lower
provins
the
upper
is
an
airy
town
with
steep
streets
commanding
fine
views
surrounded
by
sunken
and
ravines
filled
with
chestnut
trees
which
gash
the
sides
of
the
hill
with
their
deep
gulleys
the
upper
town
is
silent
clean
solemn
surmounted
by
the
imposing
ruins
of
the
old
chateau
the
lower
is
a
town
of
mills
watered
by
the
voulzie
and
the
durtain
two
rivers
of
brie
narrow
sluggish
and
deep
a
town
of
inns
shops
retired
merchants
filled
with
diligences
and
waggons
the
two
towns
or
rather
this
town
with
its
historical
memories
its
melancholy
ruins
the
gaiety
of
its
valley
the
romantic
charm
of
its
ravines
filled
with
tangled
shrubbery
and
wildflowers
its
rivers
banked
with
gardens
excites
the
love
of
all
its
children
who
do
as
the
auvergnats
the
savoyards
in
fact
all
french
folks
do
namely
leave
provins
to
make
their
fortunes
and
always
return
die
in
one
s
form
the
proverb
made
for
hares
and
faithful
souls
seems
also
the
motto
of
a
provins
native
thus
the
two
rogrons
thought
constantly
of
their
dear
provins
while
jerome
sold
his
thread
he
saw
the
upper
town
as
he
piled
up
the
cards
on
which
were
buttons
he
contemplated
the
valley
when
he
rolled
and
unrolled
his
ribbons
he
followed
the
shining
rivers
looking
up
at
his
shelves
he
saw
the
ravines
where
he
had
often
escaped
his
father
s
anger
and
gone
or
gathering
blackberries
but
the
little
square
in
the
lower
town
was
the
chief
object
of
his
thoughts
he
imagined
how
he
could
improve
his
house
he
dreamed
of
a
new
front
new
bedrooms
a
salon
a
a
and
the
kitchen
garden
out
of
which
he
would
make
an
english
with
lawns
grottos
fountains
and
statuary
the
bedrooms
at
present
occupied
by
the
brother
and
sister
on
the
second
floor
of
a
house
with
three
windows
front
and
six
storeys
high
in
the
rue
were
furnished
with
the
merest
necessaries
yet
no
one
in
paris
had
finer
furniture
than
they
in
fancy
when
jerome
walked
the
streets
he
stopped
short
struck
with
admiration
at
the
handsome
things
in
the
upholsterers
windows
and
at
the
draperies
he
coveted
for
his
house
when
he
came
home
he
would
say
to
his
sister
i
found
in
such
a
shop
such
and
such
a
piece
of
furniture
that
will
just
do
for
the
the
next
day
he
would
buy
another
piece
and
another
and
so
on
he
rejected
the
following
month
the
articles
of
the
months
before
the
budget
itself
could
not
have
paid
for
his
architectural
schemes
he
wanted
everything
he
saw
but
abandoned
each
thing
for
the
last
thing
when
he
saw
the
balconies
of
new
houses
when
he
studied
external
ornamentation
he
thought
all
such
things
mouldings
carvings
out
of
place
in
paris
ah
he
would
say
those
fine
things
would
look
much
better
at
when
he
stood
on
his
doorstep
leaning
against
the
lintel
digesting
his
morning
meal
with
a
vacant
eye
the
mercer
was
gazing
at
the
house
of
his
fancy
gilded
by
the
sun
of
his
dream
he
walked
in
his
garden
he
heard
the
jet
from
his
fountain
falling
in
pearly
drops
upon
a
slab
of
limestone
he
played
on
his
own
he
gathered
his
own
flowers
sylvie
on
the
other
hand
was
thinking
so
deeply
pen
in
hand
that
she
forgot
to
scold
the
clerks
she
was
receiving
the
bourgeoisie
of
provins
she
was
looking
at
herself
in
the
mirrors
of
her
salon
and
admiring
the
beauties
of
a
marvellous
cap
the
brother
and
sister
began
to
think
the
atmosphere
of
the
rue
unhealthy
and
the
smell
of
the
mud
in
the
markets
made
them
long
for
the
fragrance
of
the
provins
roses
they
were
the
victims
of
a
genuine
nostalgia
and
also
of
a
monomania
frustrated
at
present
by
the
necessity
of
selling
their
tapes
and
bobbins
before
they
could
leave
paris
the
promised
land
of
the
valley
of
provins
attracted
these
hebrews
all
the
more
because
they
had
really
suffered
and
for
a
long
time
as
they
crossed
breathlessly
the
sandy
wastes
of
a
mercer
s
business
the
lorrains
letter
reached
them
in
the
midst
of
meditations
inspired
by
this
glorious
future
they
knew
scarcely
anything
about
their
cousin
pierrette
lorrain
their
father
got
possession
of
the
auffray
property
after
they
left
home
and
the
old
man
said
little
to
any
one
of
his
business
affairs
they
hardly
remembered
their
aunt
lorrain
it
took
an
hour
of
genealogical
discussion
before
they
made
her
out
to
be
the
younger
sister
of
their
own
mother
by
the
second
marriage
of
their
grandfather
auffray
it
immediately
struck
them
that
this
second
marriage
had
been
fatally
injurious
to
their
interests
by
dividing
the
auffray
property
between
two
daughters
in
times
past
they
had
heard
their
father
who
was
given
to
sneering
complain
of
it
the
brother
and
sister
considered
the
application
of
the
lorrains
from
the
point
of
view
of
such
reminiscences
which
were
not
at
all
favorable
for
pierrette
to
take
charge
of
an
orphan
a
girl
a
cousin
who
might
become
their
legal
heir
in
case
neither
of
them
married
this
was
a
matter
that
needed
discussion
the
question
was
considered
and
debated
under
all
its
aspects
in
the
first
place
they
had
never
seen
pierrette
then
what
a
trouble
it
would
be
to
have
a
young
girl
to
look
after
wouldn
t
it
commit
them
to
some
obligations
towards
her
could
they
send
the
girl
away
if
they
did
not
like
her
besides
wouldn
t
they
have
to
marry
her
and
if
jerome
found
a
among
the
heiresses
of
provins
they
ought
to
keep
all
their
property
for
his
children
a
yokemate
for
jerome
according
to
sylvie
meant
a
stupid
rich
and
ugly
girl
who
would
let
herself
be
governed
they
decided
to
refuse
the
lorrain
request
sylvie
agreed
to
write
the
answer
business
being
rather
urgent
just
then
she
delayed
writing
and
the
forewoman
coming
forward
with
an
offer
for
the
stock
and
of
the
family
sister
which
the
brother
and
sister
accepted
the
matter
went
entirely
out
of
the
old
maid
s
mind
sylvie
rogron
and
her
brother
departed
for
provins
four
years
before
the
time
when
the
coming
of
brigaut
threw
such
excitement
into
pierrette
s
life
but
the
doings
of
the
pair
after
their
arrival
at
provins
are
as
necessary
to
relate
as
their
life
in
paris
for
provins
was
destined
to
be
not
less
fatal
to
pierrette
than
the
commercial
antecedents
of
her
cousins
iii
pathology
of
retired
mercers
when
the
petty
shopkeeper
who
has
come
to
paris
from
the
provinces
returns
to
the
provinces
from
paris
he
brings
with
him
a
few
ideas
then
he
loses
them
in
the
habits
and
ways
of
provincial
life
into
which
he
plunges
and
his
reforming
notions
leave
him
from
this
there
do
result
however
certain
trifling
slow
successive
changes
by
which
paris
scratches
the
surface
of
the
provincial
towns
this
process
marks
the
transition
of
the
into
the
substantial
bourgeois
but
it
acts
like
an
illness
upon
him
no
retail
shopkeeper
can
pass
with
impunity
from
his
perpetual
chatter
into
dead
silence
from
his
parisian
activity
to
the
stillness
of
provincial
life
when
these
worthy
persons
have
laid
by
property
they
spend
a
portion
of
it
on
some
desire
over
which
they
have
long
brooded
and
into
which
they
now
turn
their
remaining
impulses
no
longer
restrained
by
force
of
will
those
who
have
not
been
nursing
a
fixed
idea
either
travel
or
rush
into
the
political
interests
of
their
municipality
others
take
to
hunting
or
fishing
and
torment
their
farmers
or
tenants
others
again
become
usurers
or
as
for
the
scheme
of
the
rogrons
brother
and
sister
we
know
what
that
was
they
had
to
satisfy
an
imperious
desire
to
handle
the
trowel
and
remodel
their
old
house
into
a
charming
new
one
this
fixed
idea
produced
upon
the
square
of
lower
provins
the
front
of
the
building
which
brigaut
had
been
examining
also
the
interior
arrangements
of
the
house
and
its
handsome
furniture
the
contractor
did
not
drive
a
nail
without
consulting
the
owners
without
requiring
them
to
sign
the
plans
and
specifications
without
explaining
to
them
at
full
length
and
in
every
detail
the
nature
of
each
article
under
discussion
where
it
was
manufactured
and
what
were
its
various
prices
as
to
the
choicer
things
each
they
were
told
had
been
used
by
monsieur
tiphaine
or
madame
julliard
or
monsieur
the
mayor
the
notables
of
the
place
the
idea
of
having
things
done
as
the
rich
bourgeois
of
provins
did
them
carried
the
day
for
the
contractor
oh
if
monsieur
garceland
has
it
in
his
house
put
it
in
said
mademoiselle
rogron
it
must
be
all
right
his
taste
is
sylvie
see
he
wants
us
to
have
ovolos
in
the
cornice
of
the
do
you
call
those
ovolos
yes
what
an
odd
name
i
never
heard
it
but
you
have
seen
the
thing
do
you
understand
latin
well
it
means
eggs
from
the
latin
what
queer
fellows
you
are
you
architects
cried
rogron
it
is
stepping
on
to
deal
with
shall
we
paint
the
corridor
asked
the
builder
good
heavens
no
cried
sylvie
that
would
be
five
hundred
francs
more
oh
but
the
salon
and
the
staircase
are
too
pretty
not
to
have
the
corridor
decorated
too
said
the
man
that
little
madame
lesourd
had
hers
painted
last
and
now
her
husband
as
king
s
attorney
is
obliged
to
leave
ah
he
ll
be
chief
justice
some
of
these
days
said
the
builder
how
about
monsieur
tiphaine
monsieur
tiphaine
he
s
got
a
pretty
wife
and
is
sure
to
get
on
he
ll
go
to
paris
shall
we
paint
the
corridor
yes
yes
said
rogron
the
lesourds
must
be
made
to
see
that
we
are
as
good
as
the
first
year
after
the
rogrons
returned
to
provins
was
entirely
taken
up
by
such
discussions
by
the
pleasure
of
watching
the
workmen
by
the
surprise
occasioned
to
the
townspeople
and
the
replies
to
questions
of
all
kinds
which
resulted
therefrom
and
also
by
the
attempts
made
by
sylvie
and
her
brother
to
be
socially
intimate
with
the
principal
families
of
provins
the
rogrons
had
never
gone
into
any
society
they
had
never
left
their
shop
knowing
absolutely
no
one
in
paris
and
now
they
were
athirst
for
the
pleasures
of
social
life
on
their
arrival
in
provins
they
found
their
former
masters
in
paris
long
since
returned
to
the
provinces
monsieur
and
madame
julliard
lately
of
the
chinese
worm
their
children
and
grandchildren
the
guepin
family
or
rather
the
guepin
clan
the
youngest
scion
of
which
now
kept
the
three
distaffs
and
thirdly
madame
guenee
from
whom
they
had
purchased
the
family
sister
and
whose
three
daughters
were
married
and
settled
in
provins
these
three
races
julliard
guepin
and
guenee
had
spread
through
the
town
like
through
a
lawn
the
mayor
monsieur
garceland
was
the
of
monsieur
guepin
the
curate
abbe
peroux
was
own
brother
to
madame
julliard
the
judge
monsieur
tiphaine
junior
was
brother
to
madame
guenee
who
signed
herself
the
queen
of
the
town
was
the
beautiful
madame
tiphaine
junior
only
daughter
of
madame
roguin
the
rich
wife
of
a
former
notary
in
paris
whose
name
was
never
mentioned
clever
delicate
and
pretty
married
in
the
provinces
to
please
her
mother
who
for
special
reasons
did
not
want
her
with
her
and
took
her
from
a
convent
only
a
few
days
before
the
wedding
melanie
tiphaine
considered
herself
an
exile
in
provins
where
she
behaved
to
admiration
handsomely
dowered
she
still
had
hopes
as
for
monsieur
tiphaine
his
old
father
had
made
to
his
eldest
daughter
madame
guenee
such
advances
on
her
inheritance
that
an
estate
worth
eight
thousand
francs
a
year
situated
within
fifteen
miles
of
provins
was
to
come
wholly
to
him
consequently
the
tiphaines
would
possess
sooner
or
later
some
forty
thousand
francs
a
year
and
were
not
badly
off
as
they
say
the
one
overwhelming
desire
of
the
beautiful
madame
tiphaine
was
to
get
monsieur
tiphaine
elected
deputy
as
deputy
he
would
become
a
judge
in
paris
and
she
was
firmly
resolved
to
push
him
up
into
the
royal
courts
for
these
reasons
she
tickled
all
vanities
and
strove
to
please
all
parties
and
what
is
far
more
difficult
she
succeeded
twice
a
week
she
received
the
bourgeoisie
of
provins
at
her
house
in
the
upper
town
this
intelligent
young
woman
of
twenty
had
not
as
yet
made
a
single
blunder
or
misstep
on
the
slippery
path
she
had
taken
she
gratified
everybody
s
and
petted
their
hobbies
serious
with
the
serious
a
girl
with
girls
instinctively
a
mother
with
mothers
gay
with
young
wives
and
disposed
to
help
them
gracious
to
all
in
short
a
pearl
a
treasure
the
pride
of
provins
she
had
never
yet
said
a
word
of
her
intentions
and
wishes
but
all
the
electors
of
provins
were
awaiting
the
time
when
their
dear
monsieur
tiphaine
had
reached
the
required
age
for
nomination
every
man
in
the
place
certain
of
his
own
talents
regarded
the
future
deputy
as
his
particular
friend
his
protector
of
course
monsieur
tiphaine
would
attain
to
honors
he
would
be
keeper
of
the
seals
and
then
what
wouldn
t
he
do
for
provins
such
were
the
pleasant
means
by
which
madame
tiphaine
had
come
to
rule
over
the
little
town
madame
guenee
monsieur
tiphaine
s
sister
after
having
married
her
eldest
daughter
to
monsieur
lesourd
prosecuting
attorney
her
second
to
monsieur
martener
the
doctor
and
the
third
to
monsieur
auffray
the
notary
had
herself
married
monsieur
galardon
the
collector
mother
and
daughters
all
considered
monsieur
tiphaine
as
the
richest
and
ablest
man
in
the
family
the
prosecuting
attorney
had
the
strongest
interest
in
sending
his
uncle
to
paris
expecting
to
step
into
his
shoes
as
judge
of
the
local
court
of
provins
the
four
ladies
formed
a
sort
of
court
round
madame
tiphaine
whose
ideas
and
advice
they
followed
on
all
occasions
monsieur
julliard
the
eldest
son
of
the
old
merchant
who
had
married
the
only
daughter
of
a
rich
farmer
set
up
a
sudden
secret
and
disinterested
passion
for
madame
tiphaine
that
angel
descended
from
the
parisian
skies
the
clever
melanie
too
clever
to
involve
herself
with
julliard
but
quite
capable
of
keeping
him
in
the
condition
of
amadis
and
making
the
most
of
his
folly
advised
him
to
start
a
journal
intending
herself
to
play
the
part
of
egeria
for
the
last
two
years
therefore
julliard
possessed
by
his
romantic
passion
had
published
the
said
newspaper
called
the
which
contained
articles
literary
archaeological
and
medical
written
in
the
family
the
advertisements
paid
expenses
the
subscriptions
two
hundred
in
all
made
the
profits
every
now
and
then
melancholy
verses
totally
incomprehensible
in
la
brie
appeared
addressed
to
her
with
three
exclamation
marks
the
clan
julliard
was
thus
united
to
the
other
clans
and
the
salon
of
madame
tiphaine
became
naturally
the
first
in
the
town
the
few
aristocrats
who
lived
in
provins
were
of
course
apart
and
formed
a
single
salon
in
the
upper
town
at
the
house
of
the
old
comtesse
de
breautey
during
the
first
six
months
of
their
transplantation
the
rogrons
favored
by
their
former
acquaintance
with
several
of
these
people
were
received
first
by
madame
julliard
the
elder
and
by
the
former
madame
guenee
now
madame
galardon
from
whom
they
had
bought
their
business
and
next
after
a
good
deal
of
difficulty
by
madame
tiphaine
all
parties
wished
to
study
the
rogrons
before
admitting
them
it
was
difficult
of
course
to
keep
out
merchants
of
the
rue
originally
from
provins
who
had
returned
to
the
town
to
spend
their
fortunes
still
the
object
of
all
society
is
to
amalgamate
persons
of
equal
wealth
education
manners
customs
accomplishments
and
character
now
the
guepins
guenees
and
julliards
had
a
better
position
among
the
bourgeoisie
than
the
rogrons
whose
father
had
been
held
in
contempt
on
account
of
his
private
life
and
his
conduct
in
the
matter
of
the
auffray
property
the
facts
of
which
were
known
to
the
notary
auffray
madame
galardon
s
in
the
social
life
of
these
people
to
which
madame
tiphaine
had
given
a
certain
tone
of
elegance
all
was
homogeneous
the
component
parts
understood
each
other
knew
each
other
s
characters
and
behaved
and
conversed
in
a
manner
that
was
agreeable
to
all
the
rogrons
flattered
themselves
that
being
received
by
monsieur
garceland
the
mayor
they
would
soon
be
on
good
terms
with
all
the
best
families
in
the
town
sylvie
applied
herself
to
learn
boston
rogron
incapable
of
playing
a
game
twirled
his
thumbs
and
had
nothing
to
say
except
to
discourse
on
his
new
house
words
seemed
to
choke
him
he
would
get
up
try
to
speak
become
frightened
and
sit
down
again
with
comical
distortion
of
the
lips
sylvie
naively
betrayed
her
natural
self
at
cards
sharp
irritable
whining
when
she
lost
insolent
when
she
won
nagging
and
quarrelsome
she
annoyed
her
partners
as
much
as
her
adversaries
and
became
the
scourge
of
society
and
yet
possessed
by
a
silly
unconcealed
ambition
rogron
and
his
sister
were
bent
on
playing
a
part
in
the
society
of
a
little
town
already
in
possession
of
a
close
corporation
of
twelve
allied
families
allowing
that
the
restoration
of
their
house
had
cost
them
thirty
thousand
francs
the
brother
and
sister
possessed
between
them
at
least
ten
thousand
francs
a
year
this
they
considered
wealth
and
with
it
they
endeavored
to
impress
society
which
immediately
took
the
measure
of
their
vulgarity
crass
ignorance
and
foolish
envy
on
the
evening
when
they
were
presented
to
the
beautiful
madame
tiphaine
who
had
already
eyed
them
at
madame
garceland
s
and
at
madame
julliard
the
elder
s
the
queen
of
the
town
remarked
to
julliard
junior
who
stayed
a
few
moments
after
the
rest
of
the
company
to
talk
with
her
and
her
husband
you
all
seem
to
be
taken
with
those
no
no
said
amadis
they
bore
my
mother
and
annoy
my
wife
when
mademoiselle
sylvie
was
apprenticed
thirty
years
ago
to
my
father
none
of
them
could
endure
i
have
a
great
mind
said
madame
tiphaine
putting
her
pretty
foot
on
the
bar
of
the
fender
to
make
it
understood
that
my
salon
is
not
an
julliard
raised
his
eyes
to
the
ceiling
as
if
to
say
good
heavens
what
wit
what
intellect
i
wish
my
society
to
be
select
and
it
certainly
will
not
be
if
i
admit
those
they
have
neither
heart
nor
mind
nor
manners
said
monsieur
tiphaine
if
after
selling
thread
for
twenty
years
as
my
sister
did
for
example
your
sister
my
dear
said
his
wife
in
a
parenthesis
can
not
be
out
of
place
in
any
if
he
continued
people
are
stupid
enough
not
to
throw
off
the
shop
and
polish
their
manners
if
they
don
t
know
any
better
than
to
mistake
the
counts
of
champagne
for
the
of
a
as
rogron
did
this
evening
they
had
better
in
my
opinion
stay
at
they
are
simply
impudent
said
julliard
to
hear
them
talk
you
would
suppose
there
was
no
other
handsome
house
in
provins
but
theirs
they
want
to
crush
us
and
after
all
they
have
hardly
enough
to
live
if
it
was
only
the
brother
said
madame
tiphaine
one
might
put
up
with
him
he
is
not
so
aggressive
give
him
a
chinese
puzzle
and
he
will
stay
in
a
corner
quietly
enough
it
would
take
him
a
whole
winter
to
find
it
out
but
mademoiselle
sylvie
with
that
voice
like
a
hoarse
hyena
and
those
of
hands
don
t
repeat
all
this
when
julliard
had
departed
the
little
woman
said
to
her
husband
i
have
aborigines
enough
whom
i
am
forced
to
receive
these
two
will
fairly
kill
me
with
your
permission
i
shall
deprive
myself

replied
he
but
that
will
make
enemies
the
rogrons
will
fling
themselves
into
the
opposition
which
hitherto
has
had
no
real
strength
in
provins
that
rogron
is
already
intimate
with
baron
gouraud
and
the
lawyer
then
said
melanie
laughing
they
will
do
you
some
service
where
there
are
no
opponents
there
is
no

a

conspiracy
an
illegal
cabal
a

of
any
kind

justice
looked
at
his
young
wife
with
a
sort
of
alarmed
admiration
the
next
day
it
was
whispered
about
that
the
rogrons
had
not
altogether
succeeded
in
madame
tiphaine
s
salon
that
lady
s
speech
about
an
inn
was
immensely
admired
it
was
a
whole
month
before
she
returned
mademoiselle
sylvie
s
visit
insolence
of
this
kind
is
very
much
noticed
in
the
provinces
during
the
evening
which
sylvie
had
spent
at
madame
tiphaine
s
a
disagreeable
scene
occurred
between
herself
and
old
madame
julliard
while
playing
boston
apropos
of
a
trick
which
sylvie
declared
the
old
lady
had
made
her
lose
on
purpose
for
the
old
maid
who
liked
to
trip
others
could
never
endure
the
same
game
on
herself
the
next
time
she
was
invited
out
the
mistress
took
care
to
make
up
the
before
she
arrived
so
that
sylvie
was
reduced
to
wandering
from
table
to
table
as
an
onlooker
the
players
glancing
at
her
with
scornful
eyes
at
madame
julliard
senior
s
house
they
played
whist
a
game
sylvie
did
not
know
the
old
maid
at
last
understood
that
she
was
under
a
ban
but
she
had
no
conception
of
the
reason
of
it
she
fancied
herself
an
object
of
jealousy
to
all
these
persons
after
a
time
she
and
her
brother
received
no
invitations
but
they
still
persisted
in
paying
evening
visits
satirical
persons
made
fun
of
them
not
spitefully
but
amusingly
inveigling
them
to
talk
absurdly
about
the
eggs
in
their
cornice
and
their
wonderful
cellar
of
wine
the
like
of
which
was
not
in
provins
before
long
the
rogron
house
was
completely
finished
and
the
brother
and
sister
then
resolved
to
give
several
sumptuous
dinners
as
much
to
return
the
civilities
they
had
received
as
to
exhibit
their
luxury
the
invited
guests
accepted
from
curiosity
only
the
first
dinner
was
given
to
the
leading
personages
of
the
town
to
monsieur
and
madame
tiphaine
with
whom
however
the
rogrons
had
never
dined
to
monsieur
and
madame
julliard
senior
and
junior
to
monsieur
lesourd
monsieur
le
cure
and
monsieur
and
madame
galardon
it
was
one
of
those
interminable
provincial
dinners
where
you
sit
at
table
from
five
to
nine
o
clock
madame
tiphaine
had
introduced
into
provins
the
parisian
custom
of
taking
leave
as
soon
as
coffee
had
been
served
on
this
occasion
she
had
company
at
home
and
was
anxious
to
get
away
the
rogrons
accompanied
her
husband
and
herself
to
the
street
door
and
when
they
returned
to
the
salon
disconcerted
at
not
being
able
to
keep
their
chief
guests
the
rest
of
the
party
were
preparing
to
imitate
madame
tiphaine
s
fashion
with
cruel
provincial
promptness
they
won
t
see
our
salon
lighted
up
said
sylvie
and
that
s
the
show
of
the
the
rogrons
had
counted
on
surprising
their
guests
it
was
the
first
time
any
one
had
been
admitted
to
the
now
celebrated
house
and
the
company
assembled
at
madame
tiphaine
s
was
eagerly
awaiting
her
opinion
of
the
marvels
of
the
rogron
well
cried
little
madame
martener
you
ve
seen
the
louvre
tell
us
all
about
all
well
it
would
be
like
the
dinner
not
but
do
describe
well
to
begin
with
that
front
door
the
gilded
grating
of
which
we
have
all
admired
said
madame
tiphaine
opens
upon
a
long
corridor
which
divides
the
house
unequally
on
the
right
side
there
is
one
window
on
the
other
two
at
the
garden
end
the
corridor
opens
with
a
glass
door
upon
a
portico
with
steps
to
the
lawn
where
there
s
a
sun
dial
and
a
plaster
statue
of
spartacus
painted
to
imitate
bronze
behind
the
kitchen
the
builder
has
put
the
staircase
and
a
sort
of
larder
which
we
are
spared
the
sight
of
the
staircase
painted
to
imitate
black
marble
with
yellow
veins
turns
upon
itself
like
those
you
see
in
cafes
leading
from
the
to
the
entresol
the
balustrade
of
walnut
with
brass
ornaments
and
dangerously
slight
was
pointed
out
to
us
as
one
of
the
seven
wonders
of
the
world
the
cellar
stairs
run
under
it
on
the
other
side
of
the
corridor
is
the
which
communicates
by
with
a
salon
of
equal
size
the
windows
of
which
look
on
the
dear
me
is
there
no
asked
madame
auffray
the
corridor
full
of
draughts
answers
for
an
replied
madame
tiphaine
our
friends
have
had
they
assured
us
the
eminently
national
liberal
constitutional
and
patriotic
feeling
to
use
none
but
french
woods
in
the
house
so
the
floor
in
the
is
chestnut
the
sideboards
tables
and
chairs
of
the
same
white
calico
with
red
borders
are
held
back
by
vulgar
red
straps
these
magnificent
draperies
run
on
wooden
curtain
rods
ending
in
brass
lion
above
one
of
the
sideboards
hangs
a
dial
suspended
by
a
sort
of
napkin
in
gilded
bronze
an
idea
that
seemed
to
please
the
rogrons
hugely
they
tried
to
make
me
admire
the
invention
all
i
could
manage
to
say
was
that
if
it
was
ever
proper
to
wrap
a
napkin
round
a
dial
it
was
certainly
in
a
on
the
sideboard
were
two
huge
lamps
like
those
on
the
counter
of
a
restaurant
above
the
other
sideboard
hung
a
barometer
excessively
ornate
which
seems
to
play
a
great
part
in
their
existence
rogron
gazed
at
it
as
he
might
at
his
future
wife
between
the
two
windows
is
a
white
porcelain
stove
in
a
niche
overloaded
with
ornament
the
walls
glow
with
a
magnificent
paper
crimson
and
gold
such
as
you
see
in
the
same
restaurants
where
no
doubt
the
rogrons
chose
it
dinner
was
served
on
white
and
gold
china
with
a
dessert
service
of
light
blue
with
green
flowers
but
they
showed
us
another
service
in
earthenware
for
everyday
use
opposite
to
each
sideboard
was
a
large
cupboard
containing
linen
all
was
clean
new
and
horribly
sharp
in
tone
however
i
admit
the
it
has
some
character
though
disagreeable
it
represents
that
of
the
masters
of
the
house
but
there
is
no
enduring
the
five
engravings
that
hang
on
the
walls
the
minister
of
the
interior
ought
really
to
frame
a
law
against
them
one
was
poniatowski
jumping
into
the
elster
the
others
napoleon
pointing
a
cannon
the
defence
at
clichy
and
the
two
mazepas
all
in
gilt
frames
of
the
vulgarest
description
fit
to
carry
off
the
prize
of
disgust
oh
how
much
i
prefer
madame
julliard
s
pastels
of
fruit
those
excellent
louis
xv
pastels
which
are
in
keeping
with
the
old
and
its
gray
panels
defaced
by
age
it
is
true
but
they
possess
the
true
provincial
characteristics
that
go
well
with
old
family
silver
precious
china
and
our
simple
habits
the
provinces
are
provinces
they
are
only
ridiculous
when
they
mimic
paris
i
prefer
this
old
salon
of
my
husband
s
forefathers
with
its
heavy
curtains
of
green
and
white
damask
the
louis
xv
mantelpiece
the
twisted
the
old
mirrors
with
their
beaded
mouldings
and
the
venerable
card
tables
yes
i
prefer
my
old
sevres
vases
in
royal
blue
mounted
on
copper
my
clock
with
those
impossible
flowers
that
rococco
chandelier
and
the
tapestried
furniture
to
all
the
finery
of
the
rogron
what
is
the
salon
like
said
monsieur
martener
delighted
with
the
praise
the
handsome
parisian
bestowed
so
adroitly
on
the
provinces
as
for
the
salon
it
is
all
red
the
red
mademoiselle
sylvie
turns
when
she
loses
at
said
monsieur
tiphaine
whose
sparkling
saying
long
remained
in
the
vocabulary
of
provins
red
furniture
red
mantelpiece
red
veined
yellow
candelabra
and
clock
ditto
mounted
on
bronze
common
and
heavy
in
design
roman
standards
with
greek
foliage
above
the
clock
is
that
inevitable
lion
which
looks
at
you
with
a
simper
the
lion
of
ornamentation
with
a
big
ball
under
his
feet
symbol
of
the
decorative
lion
who
passes
his
life
holding
a
black
ball
exactly
like
a
deputy
of
the
left
perhaps
it
is
meant
as
a
constitutional
myth
the
face
of
the
clock
is
curious
the
glass
over
the
chimney
is
framed
in
that
new
fashion
of
applied
mouldings
which
is
so
trumpery
and
vulgar
from
the
ceiling
hangs
a
chandelier
carefully
wrapped
in
green
muslin
and
rightly
too
for
it
is
in
the
worst
taste
the
sharpest
tint
of
bronze
with
hideous
ornaments
the
walls
are
covered
with
a
red
flock
paper
to
imitate
velvet
enclosed
in
panels
each
panel
decorated
with
a
in
one
of
those
frames
festooned
with
stucco
flowers
to
represent
the
furniture
in
cashmere
and
consists
with
classic
uniformity
of
two
sofas
two
two
armchairs
and
six
common
chairs
a
vase
in
alabaster
called
a
la
medicis
kept
under
glass
stands
on
a
table
between
the
windows
before
the
windows
which
are
draped
with
magnificent
red
silk
curtains
and
lace
curtains
under
them
are
the
carpet
is
aubusson
and
you
may
be
sure
the
rogrons
did
not
fail
to
lay
hands
on
that
most
vulgar
of
patterns
large
flowers
on
a
red
ground
the
room
looks
as
if
no
one
ever
lived
there
there
are
no
books
no
engravings
none
of
those
little
we
all
have
lying
about
added
madame
tiphaine
glancing
at
her
own
table
covered
with
fashionable
trifles
albums
and
little
presents
given
to
her
by
friends
and
there
are
no
flowers
it
is
all
cold
and
barren
like
mademoiselle
sylvie
herself
buffon
says
the
style
is
the
man
and
certainly
salons
have
styles
of
their
from
this
sketch
everybody
can
see
the
sort
of
house
the
brother
and
sister
lived
in
though
they
can
never
imagine
the
absurdities
into
which
a
clever
builder
dragged
the
ignorant
pair
new
inventions
fantastic
ornaments
a
system
for
preventing
smoky
chimneys
another
for
preventing
damp
walls
painted
marquetry
panels
on
the
staircase
colored
glass
superfine
locks
in
short
all
those
vulgarities
which
make
a
house
expensive
and
gratify
the
bourgeois
taste
no
one
chose
to
visit
the
rogrons
whose
social
plans
thus
came
to
nothing
their
invitations
were
refused
under
various
excuses
the
evenings
were
already
engaged
to
madame
garceland
and
the
other
ladies
of
the
provins
world
the
rogrons
had
supposed
that
all
that
was
required
to
gain
a
position
in
society
was
to
give
a
few
dinners
but
no
one
any
longer
accepted
them
except
a
few
young
men
who
went
to
make
fun
of
their
host
and
hostess
and
certain
who
went
everywhere
frightened
at
the
loss
of
forty
thousand
francs
swallowed
up
without
profit
in
what
she
called
her
dear
house
sylvie
now
set
to
work
to
recover
it
by
economy
she
gave
no
more
dinners
which
had
cost
her
forty
or
fifty
francs
without
the
wines
and
did
not
fulfil
her
social
hopes
hopes
that
are
as
hard
to
realize
in
the
provinces
as
in
paris
she
sent
away
her
cook
took
a
to
do
the
menial
work
and
did
her
own
cooking
as
she
said
for
fourteen
months
after
their
return
to
provins
the
brother
and
sister
had
fallen
into
a
solitary
and
wholly
unoccupied
condition
their
banishment
from
society
roused
in
sylvie
s
heart
a
dreadful
hatred
against
the
tiphaines
julliards
and
all
the
other
members
of
the
social
world
of
provins
which
she
called
the
clique
and
with
whom
her
personal
relations
became
extremely
cold
she
would
gladly
have
set
up
a
rival
clique
but
the
lesser
bourgeoisie
was
made
up
of
either
small
shopkeepers
who
were
only
free
on
sundays
and
or
smirched
individuals
like
the
lawyer
vinet
and
doctor
neraud
and
wholly
inadmissible
bonapartists
like
baron
gouraud
with
whom
however
rogron
thoughtlessly
allied
himself
though
the
upper
bourgeoisie
had
warned
him
against
them
the
brother
and
sister
were
therefore
forced
to
sit
by
the
fire
of
the
stove
in
the
talking
over
their
former
business
trying
to
recall
the
faces
of
their
customers
and
other
matters
they
had
intended
to
forget
by
the
end
of
the
second
winter
ennui
weighed
heavily
on
them
they
did
not
know
how
to
get
through
each
day
sometimes
as
they
went
to
bed
the
words
escaped
them
there
s
another
over
they
dragged
out
the
morning
by
staying
in
bed
and
dressing
slowly
rogron
shaved
himself
every
day
examined
his
face
consulted
his
sister
on
any
changes
he
thought
he
saw
there
argued
with
the
servant
about
the
temperature
of
his
hot
water
wandered
into
the
garden
looked
to
see
if
the
shrubs
were
budding
sat
at
the
edge
of
the
water
where
he
had
built
himself
a
kiosk
examined
the
joinery
of
his
house
had
it
sprung
had
the
walls
settled
the
panels
cracked
or
he
would
come
in
fretting
about
a
sick
hen
and
complaining
to
his
sister
who
was
nagging
the
servant
as
she
set
the
table
of
the
dampness
which
was
coming
out
in
spots
upon
the
plaster
the
barometer
was
rogron
s
most
useful
bit
of
property
he
consulted
it
at
all
hours
tapped
it
familiarly
like
a
friend
saying
vile
weather
to
which
his
sister
would
reply
pooh
it
is
only
if
any
one
called
to
see
him
the
excellence
of
that
instrument
was
his
chief
topic
of
conversation
breakfast
took
up
some
little
time
with
what
deliberation
those
two
human
beings
masticated
their
food
their
digestions
were
perfect
cancer
of
the
stomach
was
not
to
be
dreaded
by
them
they
managed
to
get
along
till
twelve
o
clock
by
reading
the
and
the
the
cost
of
subscribing
to
the
parisian
paper
was
shared
by
vinet
the
lawyer
and
baron
gouraud
rogron
himself
carried
the
paper
to
gouraud
who
had
been
a
colonel
and
lived
on
the
square
and
whose
long
yarns
were
rogron
s
delight
the
latter
sometimes
puzzled
over
the
warnings
he
had
received
and
asked
himself
how
such
a
lively
companion
could
be
dangerous
he
was
fool
enough
to
tell
the
colonel
he
had
been
warned
against
him
and
to
repeat
all
the
clique
had
said
god
knows
how
the
colonel
who
feared
no
one
and
was
equally
to
be
dreaded
with
pistols
or
a
sword
gave
tongue
about
madame
tiphaine
and
her
amadis
and
the
ministerialists
of
the
upper
town
persons
capable
of
any
villany
to
get
places
and
who
counted
the
votes
at
elections
to
suit
themselves
etc
about
two
o
clock
rogron
started
for
a
little
walk
he
was
quite
happy
if
some
shopkeeper
standing
on
the
threshold
of
his
door
would
stop
him
and
say
well
pere
rogron
how
goes
it
with
then
he
would
talk
and
ask
for
news
and
gather
all
the
gossip
of
the
town
he
usually
went
as
far
as
the
upper
town
sometimes
to
the
ravines
according
to
the
weather
occasionally
he
would
meet
old
men
taking
their
walks
abroad
like
himself
such
meetings
were
joyful
events
to
him
there
happened
to
be
in

a

weary
of
parisian
life
quiet
scholars
who
lived
with
their
books
fancy
the
bewilderment
of
the
ignorant
rogron
when
he
heard
a
named
desfondrilles
more
of
an
archaeologist
than
a
magistrate
saying
to
old
monsieur
martener
a
really
learned
man
as
he
pointed
to

alcibiades
was
appointed
governor
of
guyenne
his
lungs
were
diseased
and
heaven
knows
why
the
wine
of
the
country
did
him
good
and
he
recovered
bordeaux
instantly
made
a
hundred
millions
the
marshal
widened
its
territory
to
angouleme
to
cahors
in
short
to
over
a
hundred
miles
of
circumference
it
is
hard
to
tell
where
the
bordeaux
vineyards
end
and
yet
they
haven
t
erected
an
equestrian
statue
to
the
marshal
in
bordeaux
ah
if
anything
of
that
kind
happens
to
provins
said
monsieur
desfondrilles
let
us
hope
that
somewhere
in
the
upper
or
lower
town
they
will
set
up
a
of
the
head
of
monsieur
opoix
the
of
the
mineral
waters
of
my
dear
friend
the
revival
of
provins
is
impossible
replied
monsieur
martener
the
town
was
made
bankrupt
long
what
cried
rogron
opening
his
eyes
very
wide
it
was
once
a
capital
holding
its
own
against
paris
in
the
twelfth
century
when
the
comtes
de
champagne
held
their
court
here
just
as
king
rene
held
his
in
provence
replied
the
man
of
learning
for
in
those
days
civilization
gaiety
poesy
elegance
and
women
in
short
all
social
splendors
were
not
found
exclusively
in
paris
it
is
as
difficult
for
towns
and
cities
as
it
is
for
commercial
houses
to
recover
from
ruin
nothing
is
left
to
us
of
the
old
provins
but
the
fragrance
of
our
historical
glory
and
that
of
our
roses
and
a
ah
what
mightn
t
france
be
if
she
had
only
preserved
her
feudal
capitals
said
desfondrilles
can
replace
the
poetic
gallant
warlike
race
of
the
thibaults
who
made
provins
what
ferrara
was
to
italy
weimar
to
germany
what
munich
is
trying
to
be
was
provins
ever
a
capital
asked
rogron
why
where
do
you
come
from
exclaimed
the
archaeologist
don
t
you
know
he
added
striking
the
ground
of
the
upper
town
where
they
stood
with
his
cane
don
t
you
know
that
the
whole
of
this
part
of
provins
is
built
on
catacombs
catacombs
yes
catacombs
the
extent
and
height
of
which
are
yet
undiscovered
they
are
like
the
naves
of
cathedrals
and
there
are
pillars
in
monsieur
is
writing
a
great
archaeological
work
to
explain
these
strange
constructions
interposed
monsieur
martener
seeing
that
the
was
about
to
mount
his
hobby
rogron
came
home
much
comforted
to
know
that
his
house
was
in
the
valley
the
crypts
of
provins
kept
him
occupied
for
a
week
in
explorations
and
gave
a
topic
of
conversation
to
the
unhappy
celibates
for
many
evenings
in
the
course
of
these
ramblings
rogron
picked
up
various
bits
of
information
about
provins
its
inhabitants
their
marriages
together
with
stale
political
news
all
of
which
he
narrated
to
his
sister
scores
of
times
in
his
walks
he
would
stop
and
say
often
to
the
same
person
on
the
same
day
well
what
s
the
news
when
he
reached
home
he
would
fling
himself
on
the
sofa
like
a
man
exhausted
with
labor
whereas
he
was
only
worn
out
with
the
burden
of
his
own
dulness
dinner
came
at
last
after
he
had
gone
twenty
times
to
the
kitchen
and
back
compared
the
clocks
and
opened
and
shut
all
the
doors
of
the
house
so
long
as
the
brother
and
sister
could
spend
their
evenings
in
paying
visits
they
managed
to
get
along
till
bedtime
but
after
they
were
compelled
to
stay
at
home
those
evenings
became
like
a
parching
desert
sometimes
persons
passing
through
the
quiet
little
square
would
hear
unearthly
noises
as
though
the
brother
were
throttling
the
sister
a
moment
s
listening
would
show
that
they
were
only
yawning
these
two
human
mechanisms
having
nothing
to
grind
between
their
rusty
wheels
were
creaking
and
grating
at
each
other
the
brother
talked
of
marrying
but
only
in
despair
he
felt
old
and
weary
the
thought
of
a
woman
frightened
him
sylvie
who
began
to
see
the
necessity
of
having
a
third
person
in
the
home
suddenly
remembered
the
little
cousin
about
whom
no
one
in
provins
had
yet
inquired
the
friends
of
madame
lorrain
probably
supposing
that
mother
and
child
were
both
dead
sylvie
rogron
never
lost
anything
she
was
too
thoroughly
an
old
maid
even
to
mislay
the
smallest
article
but
she
pretended
to
have
suddenly
found
the
lorrains
letter
so
as
to
mention
pierrette
naturally
to
her
brother
who
was
greatly
pleased
at
the
possibility
of
having
a
little
girl
in
the
house
sylvie
replied
to
madame
lorrain
s
letter
half
affectionately
half
commercially
as
one
may
say
explaining
the
delay
by
their
change
of
abode
and
the
settlement
of
their
affairs
she
seemed
desirous
of
receiving
her
little
cousin
and
hinted
that
pierrette
would
perhaps
inherit
twelve
thousand
francs
a
year
if
her
brother
jerome
did
not
marry
perhaps
it
is
necessary
to
have
been
like
nebuchadnezzar
something
of
a
wild
beast
and
shut
up
in
a
cage
at
the
jardin
des
plantes
without
other
prey
than
the
butcher
s
meat
doled
out
by
the
keeper
or
a
retired
merchant
deprived
of
the
joys
of
tormenting
his
clerks
to
understand
the
impatience
with
which
the
brother
and
sister
awaited
the
arrival
of
their
cousin
lorrain
three
days
after
the
letter
had
gone
the
pair
were
already
asking
themselves
when
she
would
get
there
sylvie
perceived
in
her
spurious
benevolence
towards
her
poor
cousin
a
means
of
recovering
her
position
in
the
social
world
of
provins
she
accordingly
went
to
call
on
madame
tiphaine
of
whose
reprobation
she
was
conscious
in
order
to
impart
the
fact
of
pierrette
s
approaching
arrival
deploring
the
girl
s
unfortunate
position
and
posing
herself
as
being
only
too
happy
to
succor
her
and
give
her
a
position
as
daughter
and
future
heiress
you
have
been
rather
long
in
discovering
her
said
madame
tiphaine
with
a
touch
of
sarcasm
a
few
words
said
in
a
low
voice
by
madame
garceland
while
the
cards
were
being
dealt
recalled
to
the
minds
of
those
who
heard
her
the
shameful
conduct
of
old
rogron
about
the
auffray
property
the
notary
explained
the
iniquity
where
is
the
little
girl
now
asked
monsieur
tiphaine
politely
in
brittany
said
rogron
brittany
is
a
large
place
remarked
monsieur
lesourd
her
grandfather
and
grandmother
lorrain
wrote
to
us
when
was
that
my
dear
said
rogron
addressing
his
sister
sylvie
who
was
just
then
asking
madame
garceland
where
she
had
bought
the
stuff
for
her
gown
answered
hastily
without
thinking
of
the
effect
of
her
words
before
we
sold
the
and
have
you
only
just
answered
the
letter
mademoiselle
asked
the
notary
sylvie
turned
as
red
as
a
live
coal
we
wrote
to
the
institution
of
remarked
rogron
that
is
a
sort
of
hospital
or
almshouse
for
old
people
said
monsieur
desfondrilles
who
knew
nantes
she
can
t
be
there
they
receive
no
one
under
she
is
there
with
her
grandmother
lorrain
said
rogron
her
mother
had
a
little
fortune
the
eight
thousand
francs
which
your
father
no
i
mean
of
course
your
grandfather
left
to
her
said
the
notary
making
the
blunder
intentionally
ah
said
rogron
stupidly
not
understanding
the
notary
s
sarcasm
then
you
know
nothing
about
your
cousin
s
position
or
means
asked
monsieur
tiphaine
if
monsieur
rogron
had
known
it
said
the
he
would
never
have
left
her
all
this
time
in
an
establishment
of
that
kind
i
remember
now
that
a
house
in
nantes
belonging
to
monsieur
and
madame
lorrain
was
sold
under
an
order
of
the
court
and
that
mademoiselle
lorrain
s
claim
was
swallowed
up
i
know
this
for
i
was
commissioner
at
the
the
notary
spoke
of
colonel
lorrain
who
had
he
lived
would
have
been
much
amazed
to
know
that
his
daughter
was
in
such
an
institution
the
rogrons
beat
a
retreat
saying
to
each
other
that
the
world
was
very
malicious
sylvie
perceived
that
the
news
of
her
benevolence
had
missed
its
effect
in
fact
she
had
lost
ground
in
all
minds
and
she
felt
that
henceforth
she
was
forbidden
to
attempt
an
intimacy
with
the
upper
class
of
provins
after
this
evening
the
rogrons
no
longer
concealed
their
hatred
of
that
class
and
all
its
adherents
the
brother
told
the
sister
the
scandals
that
colonel
gouraud
and
the
lawyer
vinet
had
put
into
his
head
about
the
tiphaines
the
guenees
the
garcelands
the
julliards
and
others
i
declare
sylvie
i
don
t
see
why
madame
tiphaine
should
turn
up
her
nose
at
shopkeeping
in
the
rue
it
is
more
honest
than
what
she
comes
from
madame
roguin
her
mother
is
cousin
to
those
guillaumes
of
the
who
gave
up
the
business
to
joseph
lebas
their
her
father
is
that
roguin
who
failed
in
and
ruined
the
house
of
cesar
birotteau
madame
tiphaine
s
fortune
was
stolen
for
what
else
are
you
to
call
it
when
a
notary
s
wife
who
is
very
rich
lets
her
husband
make
a
fraudulent
bankruptcy
fine
doings
and
she
marries
her
daughter
in
provins
to
get
her
out
of
the
way
all
on
account
of
her
own
relations
with
du
tillet
and
such
people
set
up
to
be
proud
well
well
that
s
the
world
on
the
day
when
jerome
rogron
and
his
sister
began
to
declaim
against
the
clique
they
were
without
being
aware
of
it
on
the
road
to
having
a
society
of
their
own
their
house
was
to
become
a
rendezvous
for
other
interests
seeking
a
centre
those
of
the
hitherto
floating
elements
of
the
liberal
party
in
provins
and
this
is
how
it
came
about
the
launch
of
the
rogrons
in
society
had
been
watched
with
great
curiosity
by
colonel
gouraud
and
the
lawyer
vinet
two
men
drawn
together
first
by
their
ostracism
next
by
their
opinions
they
both
professed
patriotism
and
for
the
same
reason
they
wished
to
become
of
consequence
the
liberals
in
provins
were
so
far
confined
to
one
old
soldier
who
kept
a
cafe
an
innkeeper
monsieur
cournant
a
notary
doctor
neraud
and
a
few
stray
persons
mostly
farmers
or
those
who
had
bought
lands
of
the
public
domain
the
colonel
and
the
lawyer
delighted
to
lay
hands
on
a
fool
whose
money
would
be
useful
to
their
schemes
and
who
might
himself
in
certain
cases
be
made
to
bell
the
cat
while
his
house
would
serve
as
a
for
the
scattered
elements
of
the
party
made
the
most
of
the
rogrons
against
the
upper
classes
of
the
place
the
three
had
already
a
slight
tie
in
their
united
subscription
to
the
constitutionnel
it
would
certainly
not
be
difficult
for
the
colonel
to
make
a
liberal
of
the
though
rogron
knew
so
little
of
politics
that
he
was
capable
of
regarding
the
exploits
of
sergeant
mercier
as
those
of
a
brother
shopkeeper
the
expected
arrival
of
pierrette
brought
to
sudden
fruition
the
selfish
ideas
of
the
two
men
inspired
as
they
were
by
the
folly
and
ignorance
of
the
celibates
seeing
that
sylvie
had
lost
all
chance
of
establishing
herself
in
the
good
society
of
the
place
an
afterthought
came
to
the
colonel
old
soldiers
have
seen
so
many
horrors
in
all
lands
so
many
grinning
corpses
on
that
no
physiognomies
repel
them
and
gouraud
began
to
cast
his
eyes
on
the
old
maid
s
fortune
this
imperial
colonel
a
short
fat
man
wore
enormous
rings
in
ears
that
were
bushy
with
tufts
of
hair
his
sparse
and
grizzled
whiskers
were
called
in
his
jolly
red
face
was
rather
discolored
like
those
of
all
who
had
lived
to
tell
of
the
beresina
the
lower
half
of
his
big
pointed
stomach
marked
the
straight
line
which
characterizes
a
cavalry
officer
gouraud
had
commanded
the
second
hussars
his
gray
moustache
hid
a
huge
blustering
mouth
if
we
may
use
a
term
which
alone
describes
that
gulf
he
did
not
eat
his
food
he
engulfed
it
a
sabre
cut
had
slit
his
nose
by
which
his
speech
was
made
thick
and
very
nasal
like
that
attributed
to
capuchins

hands
which
were
short
and
broad
were
of
the
kind
that
make
women
say
you
have
the
hands
of
a
his
legs
seemed
slender
for
his
torso
in
that
fat
and
active
body
an
absolutely
lawless
spirit
disported
itself
and
a
thorough
experience
of
the
things
of
life
together
with
a
profound
contempt
for
social
convention
lay
hidden
beneath
the
apparent
indifference
of
a
soldier
colonel
gouraud
wore
the
cross
of
an
officer
of
the
legion
of
honor
and
his
emoluments
from
that
together
with
his
salary
as
a
retired
officer
gave
him
in
all
about
three
thousand
francs
a
year
the
lawyer
tall
and
thin
had
liberal
opinions
in
place
of
talent
and
his
only
revenue
was
the
meagre
profits
of
his
office
in
provins
lawyers
plead
their
own
cases
the
court
was
unfavorable
to
vinet
on
account
of
his
opinions
consequently
even
the
farmers
who
were
liberals
when
it
came
to
lawsuits
preferred
to
employ
some
lawyer
who
was
more
congenial
to
the
judges
vinet
was
regarded
with
disfavor
in
other
ways
he
was
said
to
have
seduced
a
rich
girl
in
the
neighborhood
of
coulommiers
and
thus
have
forced
her
parents
to
marry
her
to
him
madame
vinet
was
a
chargeboeuf
an
old
and
noble
family
of
la
brie
whose
name
comes
from
the
exploit
of
a
squire
during
the
expedition
of
saint
louis
to
egypt
she
incurred
the
displeasure
of
her
father
and
mother
who
arranged
unknown
to
vinet
to
leave
their
entire
fortune
to
their
son
doubtless
charging
him
privately
to
pay
over
a
portion
of
it
to
his
sister
s
children
thus
the
first
bold
effort
of
the
ambitious
man
was
a
failure
pursued
by
poverty
and
ashamed
not
to
give
his
wife
the
means
of
making
a
suitable
appearance
he
had
made
desperate
efforts
to
enter
public
life
but
the
chargeboeuf
family
refused
him
their
influence
these
royalists
disapproved
on
moral
grounds
of
his
forced
marriage
besides
he
was
named
vinet
and
how
could
they
be
expected
to
protect
a
plebian
thus
he
was
driven
from
branch
to
branch
when
he
tried
to
get
some
good
out
of
his
marriage
repulsed
by
every
one
filled
with
hatred
for
the
family
of
his
wife
for
the
government
which
denied
him
a
place
for
the
social
world
of
provins
which
refused
to
admit
him
vinet
submitted
to
his
fate
but
his
gall
increased
he
became
a
liberal
in
the
belief
that
his
fortune
might
yet
be
made
by
the
triumph
of
the
opposition
and
he
lived
in
a
miserable
little
house
in
the
upper
town
from
which
his
wife
seldom
issued
madame
vinet
had
found
no
one
to
defend
her
since
her
marriage
except
an
old
madame
de
chargeboeuf
a
widow
with
one
daughter
who
lived
at
troyes
the
unfortunate
young
woman
destined
for
better
things
was
absolutely
alone
in
her
home
with
a
single
child
there
are
some
kinds
of
poverty
which
may
be
nobly
accepted
and
gaily
borne
but
vinet
devoured
by
ambition
and
feeling
himself
guilty
towards
his
wife
was
full
of
darkling
rage
his
conscience
grew
elastic
and
he
finally
came
to
think
any
means
of
success
permissible
his
young
face
changed
persons
about
the
courts
were
sometimes
frightened
as
they
looked
at
his
viperish
flat
head
his
slit
mouth
his
eyes
gleaming
through
glasses
and
heard
his
sharp
persistent
voice
which
rasped
their
nerves
his
muddy
skin
with
its
sickly
tones
of
green
and
yellow
expressed
the
jaundice
of
his
balked
ambition
his
perpetual
disappointments
and
his
hidden
wretchedness
he
could
talk
and
argue
he
was
and
shrewd
and
was
not
without
smartness
and
metaphor
accustomed
to
look
at
everything
from
the
standpoint
of
his
own
success
he
was
well
fitted
for
a
politician
a
man
who
shrinks
from
nothing
so
long
as
it
is
legal
is
strong
and
vinet
s
strength
lay
there
this
future
athlete
of
parliamentary
debate
who
was
destined
to
share
in
proclaiming
the
dynasty
of
the
house
of
orleans

terrible
influence
on
pierrette
s
fate
at
the
present
moment
he
was
bent
on
making
for
himself
a
weapon
by
founding
a
newspaper
at
provins
after
studying
the
rogrons
at
a
distance
the
colonel
aiding
him
he
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
brother
might
be
made
useful
this
time
he
was
not
mistaken
his
days
of
poverty
were
over
after
seven
wretched
years
when
even
his
daily
bread
was
sometimes
lacking
the
day
when
gouraud
told
him
in
the
little
square
that
the
rogrons
had
finally
quarrelled
with
the
bourgeois
aristocracy
of
the
upper
town
he
nudged
the
colonel
in
the
ribs
significantly
and
said
with
a
knowing
look
one
woman
or
another
handsome
or
ugly
don
t
care
marry
mademoiselle
rogron
and
we
can
organize
something
at
i
have
been
thinking
of
it
replied
gouraud
but
the
fact
is
they
have
sent
for
the
daughter
of
colonel
lorrain
and
she
s
their
next
of
you
can
get
them
to
make
a
will
in
your
favor
ha
you
would
get
a
very
comfortable
as
for
the
little
girl
well
well
let
s
see
her
said
the
colonel
with
a
leering
and
thoroughly
wicked
look
which
proved
to
a
man
of
vinet
s
quality
how
little
respect
the
old
trooper
could
feel
for
any
girl
iv
pierrette
after
her
grandfather
and
grandmother
entered
the
sort
of
hospital
in
which
they
sadly
expected
to
end
their
days
pierrette
being
young
and
proud
suffered
so
terribly
at
living
there
on
charity
that
she
was
thankful
when
she
heard
she
had
rich
relations
when
brigaut
the
son
of
her
mother
s
friend
the
major
and
the
companion
of
her
childhood
who
was
learning
his
trade
as
a
at
nantes
heard
of
her
departure
he
offered
her
the
money
to
pay
her
way
to
paris
in
the
diligence
sixty
francs
the
total
of
his
as
an
apprentice
slowly
amassed
and
accepted
by
pierrette
with
the
sublime
indifference
of
true
affection
showing
that
in
a
like
case
she
herself
would
be
affronted
by
thanks
brigaut
was
in
the
habit
of
going
every
sunday
to
to
play
with
pierrette
and
try
to
console
her
the
vigorous
young
workman
knew
the
dear
delight
of
bestowing
a
complete
and
devoted
protection
on
an
object
involuntarily
chosen
by
his
heart
more
than
once
he
and
pierrette
sitting
on
sundays
in
a
corner
of
the
garden
had
embroidered
the
veil
of
the
future
with
their
youthful
projects
the
apprentice
armed
with
his
plane
scoured
the
world
to
make
their
fortune
while
pierrette
waited
in
october
when
the
child
had
completed
her
eleventh
year
she
was
entrusted
by
the
two
old
people
and
by
brigaut
all
three
sorrowfully
sad
to
the
conductor
of
the
diligence
from
nantes
to
paris
with
an
entreaty
to
put
her
safely
on
the
diligence
from
paris
to
provins
and
to
take
good
care
of
her
poor
brigaut
he
ran
like
a
dog
after
the
coach
looking
at
his
dear
pierrette
as
long
as
he
was
able
in
spite
of
her
signs
he
ran
over
three
miles
and
when
at
last
he
was
exhausted
his
eyes
wet
with
tears
still
followed
her
she
too
was
crying
when
she
saw
him
no
longer
running
by
her
and
putting
her
head
out
of
the
window
she
watched
him
standing
and
looking
after
her
as
the
lumbering
vehicle
disappeared
the
lorrains
and
brigaut
knew
so
little
of
life
that
the
girl
had
not
a
penny
when
she
arrived
in
paris
the
conductor
to
whom
she
had
mentioned
her
rich
friends
paid
her
expenses
at
the
hotel
and
made
the
conductor
of
the
provins
diligence
pay
him
telling
him
to
take
good
care
of
the
girl
and
to
see
that
the
charges
were
paid
by
the
family
exactly
as
though
she
were
a
case
of
goods
four
days
after
her
departure
from
nantes
about
nine
o
clock
of
a
monday
night
a
kind
old
conductor
of
the
took
pierrette
by
the
hand
and
while
the
porters
were
discharging
in
the
grand
rue
the
packages
and
passengers
for
provins
he
led
the
little
girl
whose
only
baggage
was
a
bundle
containing
two
dresses
two
chemises
and
two
pairs
of
stockings
to
mademoiselle
rogron
s
house
which
was
pointed
out
to
him
by
the
director
at
the
coach
office
mademoiselle
and
the
rest
of
the
company
i
ve
brought
you
a
cousin
and
here
she
is
and
a
nice
little
girl
too
upon
my
word
you
have
francs
to
pay
me
and
sign
my
mademoiselle
sylvie
and
her
brother
were
dumb
with
pleasure
and
amazement
excuse
me
said
the
conductor
the
coach
is
waiting
sign
my
book
and
pay
me
francs
sixty
centimes
and
whatever
you
please
for
myself
and
the
conductor
from
nantes
we
ve
taken
care
of
the
little
girl
as
if
she
were
our
own
and
paid
for
her
beds
and
her
food
also
her
fare
to
provins
and
other
little
francs
twelve
sous
said
sylvie
you
are
not
going
to
dispute
it
cried
the
man
where
s
the
bill
said
rogron
bill
look
at
the
stop
talking
and
pay
him
said
sylvie
you
see
there
s
nothing
else
to
be
rogron
went
to
get
the
money
and
gave
the
man
francs
twelve
sous
and
nothing
for
my
comrade
and
me
said
the
conductor
sylvie
took
two
francs
from
the
depths
of
the
old
velvet
bag
which
held
her
keys
thank
you
no
said
the
man
keep
em
yourself
we
would
rather
care
for
the
little
one
for
her
own
he
picked
up
his
book
and
departed
saying
to
the
what
a
pair
it
seems
there
are
crocodiles
out
of
egypt
such
men
are
always
brutal
said
sylvie
who
overhead
the
words
they
took
good
care
of
the
little
girl
anyhow
said
adele
with
her
hands
on
her
hips
we
don
t
have
to
live
with
him
remarked
rogron
where
s
the
little
one
to
sleep
asked
adele
such
was
the
arrival
of
pierrette
lorrain
in
the
home
of
her
cousins
who
gazed
at
her
with
stolid
eyes
she
was
tossed
to
them
like
a
package
with
no
intermediate
state
between
the
wretched
chamber
at
and
the
of
her
cousins
which
seemed
to
her
a
palace
she
was
shy
and
speechless
to
all
other
eyes
than
those
of
the
rogrons
the
little
breton
girl
would
have
seemed
enchanting
as
she
stood
there
in
her
petticoat
of
coarse
blue
flannel
with
a
pink
cambric
apron
thick
shoes
blue
stockings
and
a
white
kerchief
her
hands
being
covered
by
red
worsted
mittens
edged
with
white
bought
for
her
by
the
conductor
her
dainty
breton
cap
which
had
been
washed
in
paris
for
the
journey
from
nantes
had
rumpled
it
was
like
a
halo
round
her
happy
little
face
this
national
cap
of
the
finest
lawn
trimmed
with
stiffened
lace
pleated
in
flat
folds
deserves
description
it
was
so
dainty
and
simple
the
light
coming
through
the
texture
and
the
lace
produced
a
partial
shadow
the
soft
shadow
of
a
light
upon
the
skin
which
gave
her
the
virginal
grace
that
all
painters
seek
and
leopold
robert
found
for
the
raffaelesque
face
of
the
woman
who
holds
a
child
in
his
picture
of
the
beneath
this
fluted
frame
of
light
sparkled
a
white
and
rosy
and
artless
face
glowing
with
vigorous
health
the
warmth
of
the
room
brought
the
blood
to
the
cheeks
to
the
tips
of
the
pretty
ears
to
the
lips
and
the
end
of
the
delicate
nose
making
the
natural
white
of
the
complexion
whiter
still
well
are
you
not
going
to
say
anything
i
am
your
cousin
sylvie
and
that
is
your
cousin
do
you
want
something
to
eat
asked
rogron
when
did
you
leave
nantes
asked
sylvie
is
she
dumb
said
rogron
poor
little
dear
she
has
hardly
any
clothes
cried
adele
who
had
opened
the
child
s
bundle
tied
up
in
a
handkerchief
of
the
old
lorrains
kiss
your
cousin
said
sylvie
pierrette
kissed
rogron
kiss
your
cousin
said
rogron
pierrette
kissed
sylvie
she
is
tired
out
with
her
journey
poor
little
thing
she
wants
to
go
to
sleep
said
adele
pierrette
was
overcome
with
a
sudden
and
invincible
aversion
for
her
two
relatives
a
feeling
that
no
one
had
ever
before
excited
in
her
sylvie
and
the
maid
took
her
up
to
bed
in
the
room
where
brigaut
afterwards
noticed
the
white
cotton
curtain
in
it
was
a
little
bed
with
a
pole
painted
blue
from
which
hung
a
calico
curtain
a
walnut
bureau
without
a
marble
top
a
small
table
a
a
very
common
without
a
door
and
three
chairs
completed
the
furniture
of
the
room
the
walls
which
sloped
in
front
were
hung
with
a
shabby
paper
blue
with
black
flowers
the
tiled
floor
stained
red
and
polished
was
icy
to
the
feet
there
was
no
carpet
except
for
a
strip
at
the
bedside
the
mantelpiece
of
common
marble
was
adorned
by
a
mirror
two
candelabra
in
and
a
vulgar
alabaster
cup
in
which
two
pigeons
forming
handles
were
drinking
you
will
be
comfortable
here
my
little
girl
said
sylvie
oh
it
s
beautiful
said
the
child
in
her
silvery
voice
she
s
not
difficult
to
please
muttered
the
stout
servant
sha
n
t
i
warm
her
bed
she
asked
yes
said
sylvie
the
sheets
may
be
adele
brought
one
of
her
own
when
she
returned
with
the
and
pierrette
who
had
never
slept
in
anything
but
the
coarsest
linen
sheets
was
amazed
at
the
fineness
and
softness
of
the
cotton
ones
when
she
was
fairly
in
bed
and
tucked
up
adele
going
downstairs
with
sylvie
could
not
refrain
from
saying
all
she
has
isn
t
worth
three
francs
ever
since
her
economical
regime
began
sylvie
had
compelled
the
maid
to
sit
in
the
so
that
one
fire
and
one
lamp
could
do
for
all
except
when
colonel
gouraud
and
vinet
came
on
which
occasions
adele
was
sent
to
the
kitchen
pierrette
s
arrival
enlivened
the
rest
of
the
evening
we
must
get
her
some
clothes
said
sylvie
she
has
absolutely
no
shoes
but
those
she
had
on
which
weigh
a
pound
said
adele
that
s
always
so
in
their
part
of
the
country
remarked
rogron
how
she
looked
at
her
room
though
it
really
isn
t
handsome
enough
for
a
cousin
of
yours
it
is
good
enough
hold
your
tongue
said
sylvie
gracious
what
chemises
coarse
enough
to
scratch
her
skin
off
not
a
thing
can
she
use
here
said
adele
emptying
the
bundle
master
mistress
and
servant
were
busy
till
past
ten
o
clock
deciding
what
cambric
they
should
buy
for
the
new
chemises
how
many
pairs
of
stockings
how
many
and
what
material
and
in
reckoning
up
the
whole
cost
of
pierrette
s
outfit
you
won
t
get
off
under
three
hundred
francs
said
rogron
who
could
remember
the
different
prices
and
add
them
up
from
his
former
habit
three
hundred
francs
cried
sylvie
yes
three
hundred
add
it
the
brother
and
sister
went
over
the
calculation
once
more
and
found
the
cost
would
be
fully
three
hundred
francs
not
counting
the
making
three
hundred
francs
at
one
stroke
said
sylvie
to
herself
as
she
got
into
bed
pierrette
was
one
of
those
children
of
love
whom
love
endows
with
its
tenderness
its
vivacity
its
gaiety
its
nobility
its
devotion
nothing
had
so
far
disturbed
or
wounded
a
heart
that
was
delicate
as
that
of
a
fawn
but
which
was
now
painfully
repressed
by
the
cold
greeting
of
her
cousins
if
brittany
had
been
full
of
outward
misery
at
least
it
was
full
of
love
the
old
lorrains
were
the
most
incapable
of
merchants
but
they
were
also
the
most
loving
frank
caressing
of
friends
like
all
who
are
incautious
and
free
from
calculation
their
little
granddaughter
had
received
no
other
education
at
than
that
of
nature
pierrette
went
where
she
liked
in
a
boat
on
the
pond
or
roaming
the
village
and
the
fields
with
jacques
brigaut
her
comrade
exactly
as
paul
and
virginia
might
have
done
petted
by
everybody
free
as
air
they
gaily
chased
the
joys
of
childhood
in
summer
they
ran
to
watch
the
fishing
they
caught
the
insects
they
gathered
flowers
they
gardened
in
winter
they
made
slides
they
built
or
huts
or
pelted
each
other
with
snowballs
welcomed
by
all
they
met
with
smiles
wherever
they
went
when
the
time
came
to
begin
their
education
disasters
came
too
jacques
left
without
means
at
the
death
of
his
father
was
apprenticed
by
his
relatives
to
a
and
fed
by
charity
as
pierrette
was
soon
to
be
at
until
the
little
girl
was
taken
with
her
grandparents
to
that
asylum
she
had
known
nothing
but
fond
caresses
and
protection
from
every
one
accustomed
to
confide
in
so
much
love
the
little
darling
missed
in
these
rich
relatives
so
eagerly
desired
the
kindly
looks
and
ways
which
all
the
world
even
strangers
and
the
conductors
of
the
coaches
had
bestowed
upon
her
her
bewilderment
already
great
was
increased
by
the
moral
atmosphere
she
had
entered
the
heart
turns
suddenly
cold
or
hot
like
the
body
the
poor
child
wanted
to
cry
without
knowing
why
but
being
very
tired
she
went
to
sleep
the
next
morning
pierrette
being
like
all
country
children
accustomed
to
get
up
early
was
awake
two
hours
before
the
cook
she
dressed
herself
stepping
on
tiptoe
about
her
room
looked
out
at
the
little
square
started
to
go
downstairs
and
was
struck
with
amazement
by
the
beauties
of
the
staircase
she
stopped
to
examine
all
its
details
the
painted
walls
the
brasses
the
various
ornamentations
the
window
fixtures
then
she
went
down
to
the
but
was
unable
to
open
it
and
returned
to
her
room
to
wait
until
adele
should
be
stirring
as
soon
as
the
woman
went
to
the
kitchen
pierrette
flew
to
the
garden
and
took
possession
of
it
ran
to
the
river
was
amazed
at
the
kiosk
and
sat
down
in
it
truly
she
had
enough
to
see
and
to
wonder
at
until
her
cousins
were
up
at
breakfast
sylvie
said
to
her
was
it
you
little
one
who
was
trotting
over
my
head
by
daybreak
and
making
that
racket
on
the
stairs
you
woke
me
so
that
i
couldn
t
go
to
sleep
again
you
must
be
very
good
and
quiet
and
amuse
yourself
without
noise
your
cousin
doesn
t
like
and
you
must
wipe
your
feet
said
rogron
you
went
into
the
kiosk
with
your
dirty
shoes
and
they
ve
tracked
all
over
the
floor
your
cousin
likes
cleanliness
a
great
girl
like
you
ought
to
be
clean
weren
t
you
clean
in
brittany
but
i
recollect
when
i
went
down
there
to
buy
thread
it
was
pitiable
to
see
the
folks
they
were
like
savages
at
any
rate
she
has
a
good
appetite
added
rogron
looking
at
his
sister
one
would
think
she
hadn
t
eaten
anything
for
thus
from
the
very
start
pierrette
was
hurt
by
the
remarks
of
her
two
cousins
hurt
she
knew
not
why
her
straightforward
open
nature
hitherto
left
to
itself
was
not
given
to
reflection
incapable
of
thinking
that
her
cousins
were
hard
she
was
fated
to
find
it
out
slowly
through
suffering
after
breakfast
the
brother
and
sister
pleased
with
pierrette
s
astonishment
at
the
house
and
anxious
to
enjoy
it
took
her
to
the
salon
to
show
her
its
splendors
and
teach
her
not
to
touch
them
many
celibates
driven
by
loneliness
and
the
moral
necessity
of
caring
for
something
substitute
factitious
affections
for
natural
ones
they
love
dogs
cats
canaries
servants
or
their
confessor
rogron
and
sylvie
had
come
to
the
pass
of
loving
immoderately
their
house
and
furniture
which
had
cost
them
so
dear
sylvie
began
by
helping
adele
in
the
mornings
to
dust
and
arrange
the
furniture
under
pretence
that
she
did
not
know
how
to
keep
it
looking
as
good
as
new
this
dusting
was
soon
a
desired
occupation
to
her
and
the
furniture
instead
of
losing
its
value
in
her
eyes
became
ever
more
precious
to
use
things
without
hurting
them
or
soiling
them
or
scratching
the
woodwork
or
clouding
the
varnish
that
was
the
problem
which
soon
became
the
mania
of
the
old
maid
s
life
sylvie
had
a
closet
full
of
bits
of
wool
wax
varnish
and
brushes
which
she
had
learned
to
use
with
the
dexterity
of
a
she
had
her
feather
dusters
and
her
and
she
rubbed
away
without
fear
of
hurting
herself
she
was
so
strong
the
glance
of
her
cold
blue
eyes
hard
as
steel
was
forever
roving
over
the
furniture
and
under
it
and
you
could
as
soon
have
found
a
tender
spot
in
her
heart
as
a
bit
of
fluff
under
the
sofa
after
the
remarks
made
at
madame
tiphaine
s
sylvie
dared
not
flinch
from
the
three
hundred
francs
for
pierrette
s
clothes
during
the
first
week
her
time
was
wholly
taken
up
and
pierrette
s
too
by
frocks
to
order
and
try
on
chemises
and
petticoats
to
cut
out
and
have
made
by
a
seamstress
who
went
out
by
the
day
pierrette
did
not
know
how
to
sew
that
s
pretty
bringing
up
said
rogron
don
t
you
know
how
to
do
anything
little
girl
pierrette
who
knew
nothing
but
how
to
love
made
a
pretty
childish
gesture
what
did
you
do
in
brittany
asked
rogron
i
played
she
answered
naively
everybody
played
with
me
grandmamma
and
grandpapa
they
told
me
stories
ah
they
all
loved
me
hey
said
rogron
didn
t
you
take
it
easy
pierrette
opened
her
eyes
wide
not
comprehending
she
is
as
stupid
as
an
owl
said
sylvie
to
mademoiselle
borain
the
best
seamstress
in
provins
she
s
so
young
said
the
workwoman
looking
kindly
at
pierrette
whose
delicate
little
muzzle
was
turned
up
to
her
with
a
coaxing
look
pierrette
preferred
the
to
her
relations
she
was
endearing
in
her
ways
with
them
she
watched
their
work
and
made
them
those
pretty
speeches
that
seem
like
the
flowers
of
childhood
and
which
her
cousin
had
already
silenced
for
that
gaunt
woman
loved
to
impress
those
under
her
with
salutary
awe
the
were
delighted
with
pierrette
their
work
however
was
not
carried
on
without
many
and
loud
grumblings
that
child
will
make
us
pay
through
the
nose
cried
sylvie
to
her
brother
stand
still
my
dear
and
don
t
plague
us
it
is
all
for
you
and
not
for
me
she
would
say
to
pierrette
when
the
child
was
being
measured
sometimes
it
was
when
pierrette
would
ask
the
seamstress
some
question
let
mademoiselle
borain
do
her
work
and
don
t
talk
to
her
it
is
not
you
who
are
paying
for
her
mademoiselle
said
mademoiselle
borain
am
i
to
this
yes
do
it
firmly
i
don
t
want
to
be
making
such
an
outfit
as
this
every
sylvie
put
the
same
spirit
of
emulation
into
pierrette
s
outfit
that
she
had
formerly
put
into
the
house
she
was
determined
that
her
cousin
should
be
as
well
dressed
as
madame
garceland
s
little
girl
she
bought
the
child
fashionable
boots
of
bronzed
kid
like
those
the
little
tiphaines
wore
very
fine
cotton
stockings
a
corset
by
the
best
maker
a
dress
of
blue
reps
a
pretty
cape
lined
with
white
silk
all
this
that
she
sylvie
might
hold
her
own
against
the
children
of
the
women
who
had
rejected
her
the
underclothes
were
quite
in
keeping
with
the
visible
articles
of
dress
for
sylvie
feared
the
examining
eyes
of
the
various
mothers
pierrette
s
chemises
were
of
fine
madapolam
calico
mademoiselle
borain
had
mentioned
that
the
s
little
girls
wore
cambric
drawers
embroidered
and
trimmed
in
the
latest
style
pierrette
had
the
same
sylvie
ordered
for
her
a
charming
little
drawn
bonnet
of
blue
velvet
lined
with
white
satin
precisely
like
the
one
worn
by
martener
s
little
daughter
thus
attired
pierrette
was
the
most
enchanting
little
girl
in
all
provins
on
sunday
after
church
all
the
ladies
kissed
her
mesdames
tiphaine
garceland
galardon
julliard
and
the
rest
fell
in
love
with
the
sweet
little
breton
girl
this
enthusiasm
was
deeply
flattering
to
old
sylvie
s
she
regarded
it
as
less
due
to
pierrette
than
to
her
own
benevolence
she
ended
however
in
being
affronted
by
her
cousin
s
success
pierrette
was
constantly
invited
out
and
sylvie
allowed
her
to
go
always
for
the
purpose
of
triumphing
over
those
pierrette
was
much
in
demand
for
games
or
little
parties
and
dinners
with
their
own
little
girls
she
had
succeeded
where
the
rogrons
had
failed
and
mademoiselle
sylvie
soon
grew
indignant
that
pierrette
was
asked
to
other
children
s
houses
when
those
children
never
came
to
hers
the
artless
little
thing
did
not
conceal
the
pleasure
she
found
in
her
visits
to
these
ladies
whose
affectionate
manners
contrasted
strangely
with
the
harshness
of
her
two
cousins
a
mother
would
have
rejoiced
in
the
happiness
of
her
little
one
but
the
rogrons
had
taken
pierrette
for
their
own
sakes
not
for
hers
their
feelings
far
from
being
parental
were
dyed
in
selfishness
and
a
sort
of
commercial
calculation
the
handsome
outfit
the
fine
sunday
dresses
and
the
frocks
were
the
beginning
of
pierrette
s
troubles
like
all
children
free
to
amuse
themselves
who
are
accustomed
to
follow
the
dictates
of
their
own
lively
fancies
she
was
very
hard
on
her
clothes
her
shoes
and
above
all
on
those
embroidered
drawers
a
mother
when
she
reproves
her
child
thinks
only
of
the
child
her
voice
is
gentle
she
does
not
raise
it
unless
driven
to
extremities
or
when
the
child
is
much
in
fault
but
here
in
this
great
matter
of
pierrette
s
clothes
the
cousins
money
was
the
first
consideration
their
interests
were
to
be
thought
of
not
the
child
s
children
have
the
perceptions
of
the
canine
race
for
the
sentiments
of
those
who
rule
them
they
know
instinctively
whether
they
are
loved
or
only
tolerated
pure
and
innocent
hearts
are
more
distressed
by
shades
of
difference
than
by
contrasts
a
child
does
not
understand
evil
but
it
knows
when
the
instinct
of
the
good
and
the
beautiful
which
nature
has
implanted
in
it
is
shocked
the
lectures
which
pierrette
now
drew
upon
herself
on
propriety
of
behavior
modesty
and
economy
were
merely
the
corollary
of
the
one
theme
pierrette
will
ruin
these
perpetual
which
were
destined
to
have
a
fatal
result
for
the
poor
child
brought
the
two
celibates
back
to
the
old
beaten
track
of
their
habits
from
which
their
removal
to
provins
had
parted
them
and
in
which
their
natures
were
now
to
expand
and
flourish
accustomed
in
the
old
days
to
rule
and
to
make
inquisitions
to
order
about
and
reprove
their
clerks
sharply
rogron
and
his
sister
had
actually
suffered
for
want
of
victims
little
minds
need
to
practise
despotism
to
relieve
their
nerves
just
as
great
souls
thirst
for
equality
in
friendship
to
exercise
their
hearts
narrow
natures
expand
by
persecuting
as
much
as
others
through
beneficence
they
prove
their
power
over
their
fellows
by
cruel
tyranny
as
others
do
by
loving
kindness
they
simply
go
the
way
their
temperaments
drive
them
add
to
this
the
propulsion
of
and
you
may
read
the
enigma
of
most
social
matters
thenceforth
pierrette
became
a
necessity
to
the
lives
of
her
cousins
from
the
day
of
her
coming
their
minds
were
occupied
first
with
her
outfit
and
then
with
the
novelty
of
a
third
presence
but
every
new
thing
a
sentiment
and
even
a
tyranny
is
moulded
as
time
goes
on
into
fresh
shapes
sylvie
began
by
calling
pierrette
my
dear
or
little
then
she
abandoned
the
gentler
terms
for
pierrette
only
her
reprimands
at
first
only
cross
became
sharp
and
angry
and
no
sooner
were
their
feet
on
the
path
of
than
the
brother
and
sister
made
rapid
strides
they
were
no
longer
bored
to
death
it
was
not
their
deliberate
intention
to
be
wicked
and
cruel
it
was
simply
the
blind
instinct
of
an
imbecile
tyranny
the
pair
believed
they
were
doing
pierrette
a
service
just
as
they
had
thought
their
harshness
a
benefit
to
their
apprentices
pierrette
whose
true
and
noble
and
extreme
sensibility
was
the
antipodes
of
the
rogrons
hardness
had
a
dread
of
being
scolded
it
wounded
her
so
sharply
that
the
tears
would
instantly
start
in
her
beautiful
pure
eyes
she
had
a
great
struggle
with
herself
before
she
could
repress
the
enchanting
sprightliness
which
made
her
so
great
a
favorite
elsewhere
after
a
time
she
displayed
it
only
in
the
homes
of
her
little
friends
by
the
end
of
the
first
month
she
had
learned
to
be
passive
in
her
cousins
house
so
much
so
that
rogron
one
day
asked
her
if
she
was
at
that
sudden
question
she
ran
to
the
end
of
the
garden
and
stood
crying
beside
the
river
into
which
her
tears
may
have
fallen
as
she
herself
was
about
to
fall
into
the
social
torrent
one
day
in
spite
of
all
her
care
she
tore
her
best
reps
frock
at
madame
tiphaine
s
where
she
was
spending
a
happy
day
the
poor
child
burst
into
tears
foreseeing
the
cruel
things
which
would
be
said
to
her
at
home
questioned
by
her
friends
she
let
fall
a
few
words
about
her
terrible
cousin
madame
tiphaine
happened
to
have
some
reps
exactly
like
that
of
the
frock
and
she
put
in
a
new
breadth
herself
mademoiselle
rogron
found
out
the
trick
as
she
expressed
it
which
the
little
devil
had
played
her
from
that
day
forth
she
refused
to
let
pierrette
go
to
any
of
those
women
s
houses
the
life
the
poor
girl
led
in
provins
was
divided
into
three
distinct
phases
the
first
already
shown
in
which
she
had
some
joy
mingled
with
the
cold
kindness
of
her
cousins
and
their
sharp
reproaches
lasted
three
months
sylvie
s
refusal
to
let
her
go
to
her
little
friends
backed
by
the
necessity
of
beginning
her
education
ended
the
first
phase
of
her
life
at
provins
the
only
period
when
that
life
was
bearable
to
her
these
events
produced
at
the
rogrons
by
pierrette
s
presence
were
studied
by
vinet
and
the
colonel
with
the
caution
of
foxes
preparing
to
enter
a
and
disturbed
by
seeing
a
strange
fowl
they
both
called
from
time
to
time
but
seldom
so
as
not
to
alarm
the
old
maid
they
talked
with
rogron
under
various
pretexts
and
made
themselves
masters
of
his
mind
with
an
affectation
of
reserve
and
modesty
which
the
great
tartuffe
himself
would
have
respected
the
colonel
and
the
lawyer
were
spending
the
evening
with
rogron
on
the
very
day
when
sylvie
had
refused
in
bitter
language
to
let
pierrette
go
again
to
madame
tiphaine
s
or
elsewhere
being
told
of
this
refusal
the
colonel
and
the
lawyer
looked
at
each
other
with
an
air
which
seemed
to
say
that
they
at
least
knew
provins
well
madame
tiphaine
intended
to
insult
you
said
the
lawyer
we
have
long
been
warning
rogron
of
what
would
happen
there
s
no
good
to
be
got
from
those
what
can
you
expect
from
the
party
cried
the
colonel
twirling
his
moustache
and
interrupting
the
lawyer
but
mademoiselle
if
we
had
tried
to
warn
you
from
those
people
you
might
have
supposed
we
had
some
malicious
motive
in
what
we
said
if
you
like
a
game
of
cards
in
the
evening
why
don
t
you
have
it
at
home
why
not
play
your
boston
here
in
your
own
house
is
it
impossible
to
fill
the
places
of
those
idiots
the
julliards
and
all
the
rest
of
them
vinet
and
i
know
how
to
play
boston
and
we
can
easily
find
a
fourth
vinet
might
present
his
wife
to
you
she
is
charming
and
what
is
more
a
chargeboeuf
you
will
not
be
so
exacting
as
those
apes
of
the
upper
town
won
t
require
a
good
little
housewife
who
is
compelled
by
the
meanness
of
her
family
to
do
her
own
work
to
dress
like
a
duchess
poor
woman
she
has
the
courage
of
a
lion
and
the
meekness
of
a
sylvie
rogron
showed
her
long
yellow
teeth
as
she
smiled
on
the
colonel
who
bore
the
sight
heroically
and
assumed
a
flattered
air
if
we
are
only
four
we
can
t
play
boston
every
night
said
sylvie
why
not
what
do
you
suppose
an
old
soldier
of
the
empire
like
me
does
with
himself
and
as
for
vinet
his
evenings
are
always
free
besides
you
ll
have
plenty
of
other
visitors
i
warrant
you
that
he
added
with
a
rather
mysterious
air
what
you
ought
to
do
said
vinet
is
to
take
an
open
stand
against
the
ministerialists
of
provins
and
form
an
opposition
to
them
you
would
soon
see
how
popular
that
would
make
you
you
would
have
a
society
about
you
at
once
the
tiphaines
would
be
furious
at
an
opposition
salon
well
well
why
not
laugh
at
others
if
others
laugh
at
you
and
they
do
the
clique
doesn
t
mince
matters
in
talking
about
how
s
that
demanded
sylvie
in
the
provinces
there
is
always
a
valve
or
a
faucet
through
which
gossip
leaks
from
one
social
set
to
another
vinet
knew
all
the
slurs
cast
upon
the
rogrons
in
the
salons
from
which
they
were
now
excluded
the
and
archaeologist
desfondrilles
belonged
to
neither
party
with
other
independents
like
him
he
repeated
what
he
heard
on
both
sides
and
vinet
made
the
most
of
it
the
lawyer
s
spiteful
tongue
put
venom
into
madame
tiphaine
s
speeches
and
by
showing
rogron
and
sylvie
the
ridicule
they
had
brought
upon
themselves
he
roused
an
undying
spirit
of
hatred
in
those
bitter
natures
which
needed
an
object
for
their
petty
passions
a
few
days
later
vinet
brought
his
wife
a
woman
neither
pretty
nor
plain
timid
very
gentle
and
deeply
conscious
of
her
false
position
madame
vinet
was
faded
by
the
cares
of
her
poor
household
and
very
simply
dressed
no
woman
could
have
pleased
sylvie
more
madame
vinet
endured
her
airs
and
bent
before
them
like
one
accustomed
to
subjection
on
the
poor
woman
s
rounded
brow
and
delicately
timid
cheek
and
in
her
slow
and
gentle
glance
were
the
traces
of
deep
reflection
of
those
perceptive
thoughts
which
women
who
are
accustomed
to
suffer
bury
in
total
silence
the
influence
of
the
colonel
who
now
displayed
to
sylvie
the
graces
of
a
courtier
in
marked
contradiction
to
his
usual
military
brusqueness
together
with
that
of
the
astute
vinet
was
soon
to
harm
the
breton
child
shut
up
in
the
house
no
longer
allowed
to
go
out
except
in
company
with
her
old
cousin
pierrette
that
pretty
little
squirrel
was
at
the
mercy
of
the
incessant
cry
don
t
touch
that
child
let
that
alone
she
was
perpetually
being
lectured
on
her
carriage
and
behavior
if
she
stooped
or
rounded
her
shoulders
her
cousin
would
call
to
her
to
be
as
erect
as
herself
sylvie
was
rigid
as
a
soldier
presenting
arms
to
his
colonel
sometimes
indeed
the
old
maid
enforced
the
order
by
slaps
on
the
back
to
make
the
girl
straighten
up
thus
the
free
and
joyous
little
child
of
the
marais
learned
by
degrees
to
repress
all
liveliness
and
to
make
herself
as
best
she
could
an
automaton
history
of
poor
cousins
in
the
home
of
rich
ones
one
evening
which
marked
the
beginning
of
pierrette
s
second
phase
of
life
in
her
cousin
s
house
the
child
whom
the
three
guests
had
not
seen
during
the
evening
came
into
the
room
to
kiss
her
relatives
and
say
to
the
company
sylvie
turned
her
cheek
coldly
to
the
pretty
creature
as
if
to
avoid
kissing
her
the
motion
was
so
cruelly
significant
that
the
tears
sprang
to
pierrette
s
eyes
did
you
prick
yourself
little
girl
said
the
atrocious
vinet
what
is
the
matter
asked
sylvie
severely
nothing
said
the
poor
child
going
up
to
rogron
nothing
said
sylvie
that
s
nonsense
nobody
cries
for
what
is
it
my
little
darling
said
madame
vinet
my
rich
cousin
isn
t
as
kind
to
me
as
my
poor
grandmother
was
sobbed
pierrette
your
grandmother
took
your
money
said
sylvie
and
your
cousin
will
leave
you
the
colonel
and
the
lawyer
glanced
at
each
other
i
would
rather
be
robbed
and
loved
said
pierrette
then
you
shall
be
sent
back
whence
you
but
what
has
the
dear
little
thing
done
asked
madame
vinet
vinet
gave
his
wife
the
terrible
fixed
cold
look
with
which
men
enforce
their
absolute
dominion
the
hapless
helot
punished
incessantly
for
not
having
the
one
thing
that
was
wanted
of
her
a
fortune
took
up
her
cards
what
has
she
done
said
sylvie
throwing
up
her
head
with
such
violence
that
the
yellow
in
her
cap
nodded
she
is
always
looking
about
to
annoy
us
she
opened
my
watch
to
see
the
inside
and
meddled
with
the
wheel
and
broke
the
mainspring
mademoiselle
pays
no
heed
to
what
is
said
to
her
i
am
all
day
long
telling
her
to
take
care
of
things
and
i
might
just
as
well
talk
to
that
pierrette
ashamed
at
being
reproved
before
strangers
crept
softly
out
of
the
room
i
am
thinking
all
the
time
how
to
subdue
that
child
said
rogron
isn
t
she
old
enough
to
go
to
school
asked
madame
vinet
again
she
was
silenced
by
a
look
from
her
husband
who
had
been
careful
to
tell
her
nothing
of
his
own
or
the
colonel
s
schemes
this
is
what
comes
of
taking
charge
of
other
people
s
children
cried
the
colonel
you
may
still
have
some
of
your
own
you
or
your
brother
why
don
t
you
both
marry
sylvie
smiled
agreeably
on
the
colonel
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
met
a
man
to
whom
the
idea
that
she
could
marry
did
not
seem
absurd
madame
vinet
is
right
cried
rogron
perhaps
teaching
would
keep
pierrette
quiet
a
master
wouldn
t
cost
the
colonel
s
remark
so
preoccupied
sylvie
that
she
made
no
answer
to
her
brother
if
you
are
willing
to
be
security
for
that
opposition
journal
i
was
talking
to
you
about
said
vinet
you
will
find
an
excellent
master
for
the
little
cousin
in
the
managing
editor
we
intend
to
engage
that
poor
schoolmaster
who
lost
his
employment
through
the
encroachments
of
the
clergy
my
wife
is
right
pierrette
is
a
rough
diamond
that
wants
i
thought
you
were
a
baron
said
sylvie
to
the
colonel
while
the
cards
were
being
dealt
and
after
a
long
pause
in
which
they
had
all
been
rather
thoughtful
yes
but
when
i
was
made
baron
in
after
the
battle
of
nangis
where
my
regiment
performed
miracles
i
had
money
and
influence
enough
to
secure
the
rank
but
now
my
barony
is
like
the
grade
of
general
which
i
held
in
it
needs
a
revolution
to
give
it
back
to
if
you
will
secure
my
endorsement
by
a
mortgage
said
rogron
answering
vinet
after
long
consideration
i
will
give
that
can
easily
be
arranged
said
vinet
the
new
paper
will
soon
restore
the
colonel
s
rights
and
make
your
salon
more
powerful
in
provins
than
those
of
tiphaine
and
how
so
asked
sylvie
while
his
wife
was
dealing
and
vinet
himself
explaining
the
importance
they
would
all
gain
by
the
publication
of
an
independent
newspaper
pierrette
was
dissolved
in
tears
her
heart
and
her
mind
were
one
in
this
matter
she
felt
and
knew
that
her
cousin
was
more
to
blame
than
she
was
the
little
country
girl
instinctively
understood
that
charity
and
benevolence
ought
to
be
a
complete
offering
she
hated
her
handsome
frocks
and
all
the
things
that
were
made
for
her
she
was
forced
to
pay
too
dearly
for
such
benefits
she
wept
with
vexation
at
having
given
cause
for
complaint
against
her
and
resolved
to
behave
in
future
in
such
a
way
as
to
compel
her
cousins
to
find
no
further
fault
with
her
the
thought
then
came
into
her
mind
how
grand
brigaut
had
been
in
giving
her
all
his
savings
without
a
word
poor
child
she
fancied
her
troubles
were
now
at
their
worst
she
little
knew
that
other
misfortunes
were
even
now
being
planned
for
her
in
the
salon
a
few
days
later
pierrette
had
a
she
was
taught
to
read
write
and
cipher
enormous
injury
was
thus
supposed
to
be
done
to
the
rogrons
house
were
found
on
the
tables
on
the
furniture
on
pierrette
s
clothes
and
pens
were
left
about
sand
was
scattered
everywhere
books
were
torn
and
dog
as
the
result
of
these
lessons
she
was
told
in
harsh
terms
that
she
would
have
to
earn
her
own
living
and
not
be
a
burden
to
others
as
she
listened
to
these
cruel
remarks
pierrette
s
throat
contracted
violently
with
acute
pain
her
heart
throbbed
she
was
forced
to
restrain
her
tears
or
she
was
scolded
for
weeping
and
told
it
was
an
insult
to
the
kindness
of
her
magnanimous
cousins
rogron
had
found
the
life
that
suited
him
he
scolded
pierrette
as
he
used
to
scold
his
clerks
he
would
call
her
when
at
play
and
compel
her
to
study
he
made
her
repeat
her
lessons
and
became
himself
the
almost
savage
master
of
the
poor
child
sylvie
on
her
side
considered
it
a
duty
to
teach
pierrette
the
little
that
she
knew
herself
about
women
s
work
neither
rogron
nor
his
sister
had
the
slightest
softness
in
their
natures
their
narrow
minds
which
found
real
pleasure
in
worrying
the
poor
child
passed
insensibly
from
outward
kindness
to
extreme
severity
this
severity
was
necessitated
they
believed
by
what
they
called
the
of
the
child
which
had
not
been
broken
when
young
and
was
very
obstinate
her
masters
were
ignorant
how
to
give
to
their
instructions
a
form
suited
to
the
intelligence
of
the
pupil
a
thing
by
the
bye
which
marks
the
difference
between
public
and
private
education
the
fault
was
far
less
with
pierrette
than
with
her
cousins
it
took
her
an
infinite
length
of
time
to
learn
the
rudiments
she
was
called
stupid
and
dull
clumsy
and
awkward
for
mere
nothings
incessantly
abused
in
words
the
child
suffered
still
more
from
the
harsh
looks
of
her
cousins
she
acquired
the
doltish
ways
of
a
sheep
she
dared
not
do
anything
of
her
own
impulse
for
all
she
did
was
misinterpreted
misjudged
and
in
all
things
she
awaited
silently
the
good
pleasure
and
the
orders
of
her
cousins
keeping
her
thoughts
within
her
own
mind
and
sheltering
herself
behind
a
passive
obedience
her
brilliant
colors
began
to
fade
sometimes
she
complained
of
feeling
ill
when
her
cousin
asked
where
the
poor
little
thing
who
had
pains
all
over
her
answered
nonsense
who
ever
heard
of
any
one
suffering
everywhere
cried
sylvie
if
you
suffered
everywhere
you
d
be
people
suffer
in
their
chests
said
rogron
who
liked
to
hear
himself
harangue
or
they
have
toothache
headache
pains
in
their
feet
or
stomach
but
no
one
has
pains
everywhere
what
do
you
mean
by
everywhere
i
can
tell
you
everywhere
means
don
t
you
know
what
you
are
doing
you
are
complaining
for
complaining
s
pierrette
ended
by
total
silence
seeing
how
all
her
girlish
remarks
the
flowers
of
her
dawning
intelligence
were
replied
to
with
ignorant
commonplaces
which
her
natural
good
sense
told
her
were
ridiculous
you
complain
said
rogron
but
you
ve
got
the
appetite
of
a
the
only
person
who
did
not
bruise
the
delicate
little
flower
was
the
fat
servant
woman
adele
adele
would
go
up
and
warm
her
bed
doing
it
on
the
sly
after
a
certain
evening
when
sylvie
had
scolded
her
for
giving
that
comfort
to
the
child
children
should
be
hardened
to
give
them
strong
constitutions
am
i
and
my
brother
the
worse
for
it
said
sylvie
you
ll
make
pierrette
a
this
was
a
word
in
the
rogron
vocabulary
which
meant
a
puny
and
suffering
little
being
the
naturally
endearing
ways
of
the
angelic
child
were
treated
as
dissimulation
the
fresh
pure
blossoms
of
affection
which
bloomed
instinctively
in
that
young
soul
were
pitilessly
crushed
pierrette
suffered
many
a
cruel
blow
on
the
tender
flesh
of
her
heart
if
she
tried
to
soften
those
ferocious
natures
by
innocent
coaxing
wiles
they
accused
her
of
doing
it
with
an
object
tell
me
at
once
what
you
want
rogron
would
say
brutally
you
are
not
coaxing
me
for
neither
brother
nor
sister
believed
in
affection
and
pierrette
s
whole
being
was
affection
colonel
gouraud
anxious
to
please
mademoiselle
rogron
approved
of
all
she
did
about
pierrette
vinet
also
encouraged
them
in
what
they
said
against
her
he
attributed
all
her
misdeeds
to
the
obstinacy
of
the
breton
character
and
declared
that
no
power
no
will
could
ever
conquer
it
rogron
and
his
sister
were
so
shrewdly
flattered
by
the
two
manoeuvrers
that
the
former
agreed
to
go
security
for
the
courrier
de
provins
and
the
latter
invested
five
thousand
francs
in
the
enterprise
on
this
the
colonel
and
lawyer
took
the
field
they
got
a
hundred
shares
of
five
hundred
francs
each
taken
among
the
farmers
and
others
called
independents
and
also
among
those
who
had
bought
lands
of
the
national
domains
whose
fears
they
worked
upon
they
even
extended
their
operations
throughout
the
department
and
along
its
borders
each
shareholder
of
course
subscribed
to
the
paper
the
judicial
advertisements
were
divided
between
the
and
the
the
first
issue
of
the
latter
contained
a
pompous
eulogy
on
rogron
he
was
presented
to
the
community
as
the
laffitte
of
provins
the
public
mind
having
thus
received
an
impetus
in
this
new
direction
it
was
manifest
of
course
that
the
coming
elections
would
be
contested
madame
tiphaine
whose
highest
hope
was
to
take
her
husband
to
paris
as
deputy
was
in
despair
after
reading
an
article
in
the
new
paper
aimed
at
her
and
at
julliard
junior
she
remarked
unfortunately
for
me
i
forgot
that
there
is
always
a
scoundrel
close
to
a
dupe
and
that
fools
are
magnets
to
clever
men
of
the
fox
as
soon
as
the
courrier
was
fairly
launched
on
a
radius
of
fifty
miles
vinet
bought
a
new
coat
and
decent
boots
waistcoats
and
trousers
he
set
up
the
gray
slouch
hat
sacred
to
liberals
and
showed
his
linen
his
wife
took
a
servant
and
appeared
in
public
dressed
as
the
wife
of
a
prominent
man
should
be
her
caps
were
pretty
vinet
proved
grateful
out
of
policy
he
and
his
friend
cournant
the
liberal
notary
and
the
rival
of
the
ministerial
notary
auffray
became
the
close
advisers
of
the
rogrons
to
whom
they
were
able
to
do
a
couple
of
signal
services
the
leases
granted
by
old
rogron
to
their
father
in
when
matters
were
at
a
low
ebb
were
about
to
expire
horticulture
and
vegetable
gardening
had
developed
enormously
in
the
neighborhood
of
provins
the
lawyer
and
notary
set
to
work
to
enable
the
rogrons
to
increase
their
rentals
vinet
won
two
lawsuits
against
two
districts
on
a
question
of
planting
trees
which
involved
five
hundred
poplars
the
proceeds
of
the
poplars
added
to
the
savings
of
the
brother
and
sister
who
for
the
last
three
years
had
laid
by
six
thousand
a
year
at
high
interest
was
wisely
invested
in
the
purchase
of
improved
lands
vinet
also
undertook
and
carried
out
the
ejectment
of
certain
peasants
to
whom
the
elder
rogron
had
lent
money
on
their
farms
and
who
had
strained
every
nerve
to
pay
off
the
debt
but
in
vain
the
cost
of
the
rogrons
fine
house
was
thus
in
a
measure
recouped
their
landed
property
lying
around
provins
and
chosen
by
their
father
with
the
sagacious
eye
of
an
innkeeper
was
divided
into
small
holdings
the
largest
of
which
did
not
exceed
five
acres
and
rented
to
safe
tenants
men
who
owned
other
parcels
of
land
that
were
ample
security
for
their
leases
these
investments
brought
in
by
five
thousand
francs
a
year
taxes
were
charged
to
the
tenants
and
there
were
no
buildings
needing
insurance
or
repairs
by
the
end
of
the
second
period
of
pierrette
s
stay
in
provins
life
had
become
so
hard
for
her
the
cold
indifference
of
all
who
came
to
the
house
the
silly
and
the
total
absence
of
affection
on
the
part
of
her
cousins
grew
so
bitter
she
was
conscious
of
a
chill
dampness
like
that
of
a
grave
creeping
round
her
that
the
bold
idea
of
escaping
on
foot
and
without
money
to
brittany
and
to
her
grandparents
took
possession
of
her
mind
two
events
hindered
her
from
attempting
it
old
lorrain
died
and
rogron
was
appointed
guardian
of
his
little
cousin
if
the
grandmother
had
died
first
we
may
believe
that
rogron
advised
by
vinet
would
have
claimed
pierrette
s
eight
thousand
francs
and
reduced
the
old
man
to
penury
you
may
perhaps
inherit
from
pierrette
said
vinet
with
a
horrid
smile
who
knows
who
may
live
and
who
may
die
enlightened
by
that
remark
rogron
gave
old
madame
lorrain
no
peace
until
she
had
secured
to
pierrette
the
reversion
of
the
eight
thousand
francs
at
her
death
pierrette
was
deeply
shocked
by
these
events
she
was
on
the
point
of
making
her
first
communion
another
reason
for
resigning
the
hope
of
escape
from
provins
this
ceremony
simple
and
customary
as
it
was
led
to
great
changes
in
the
rogron
household
sylvie
learned
that
monsieur
le
cure
peroux
was
instructing
the
little
julliards
lesourds
garcelands
and
the
rest
she
therefore
made
it
a
point
of
honor
that
pierrette
should
be
instructed
by
the
vicar
himself
monsieur
habert
a
priest
who
was
thought
to
belong
to
the
very
zealous
for
the
interests
of
the
church
and
much
feared
in
provins
a
man
who
hid
a
vast
ambition
beneath
the
austerity
of
stern
principles
the
sister
of
this
priest
an
unmarried
woman
about
thirty
years
of
age
kept
a
school
for
young
ladies
brother
and
sister
looked
alike
both
were
thin
yellow
and
bilious
like
a
true
breton
girl
cradled
in
the
practices
and
poetry
of
catholicism
pierrette
opened
her
heart
and
ears
to
the
words
of
this
imposing
priest
sufferings
predispose
the
mind
to
devotion
and
nearly
all
young
girls
impelled
by
instinctive
tenderness
are
inclined
to
mysticism
the
deepest
aspect
of
religion
the
priest
found
good
soil
in
which
to
sow
the
seed
of
the
gospel
and
the
dogmas
of
the
church
he
completely
changed
the
current
of
the
girl
s
thoughts
pierrette
loved
jesus
christ
in
the
light
in
which
he
is
presented
to
young
girls
at
the
time
of
their
first
communion
as
a
celestial
bridegroom
her
physical
and
moral
sufferings
gained
a
meaning
for
her
she
saw
the
finger
of
god
in
all
things
her
soul
so
cruelly
hurt
although
she
could
not
accuse
her
cousins
of
actual
wrong
took
refuge
in
that
sphere
to
which
all
sufferers
fly
on
the
wings
of
the
cardinal
virtues
faith
hope
charity
she
abandoned
her
thoughts
of
escape
sylvie
surprised
by
the
transformation
monsieur
habert
had
effected
in
pierrette
was
curious
to
know
how
it
had
been
done
and
it
thus
came
about
that
the
austere
priest
while
preparing
pierrette
for
her
first
communion
also
won
to
god
the
hitherto
erring
soul
of
mademoiselle
sylvie
sylvie
became
pious
jerome
rogron
on
whom
the
jesuit
could
get
no
grip
for
just
then
the
influence
of
his
majesty
the
late
the
first
was
more
powerful
over
weaklings
than
the
influence
of
the
church
jerome
rogron
remained
faithful
to
colonel
gouraud
vinet
and
liberalism
mademoiselle
rogron
naturally
made
the
acquaintance
of
mademoiselle
habert
with
whom
she
sympathized
deeply
the
two
spinsters
loved
each
other
as
sisters
mademoiselle
habert
offered
to
take
pierrette
into
her
school
to
spare
sylvie
the
annoyance
of
her
education
but
the
brother
and
sister
both
declared
that
pierrette
s
absence
would
make
the
house
too
lonely
their
attachment
to
their
little
cousin
seemed
excessive
when
gouraud
and
vinet
became
aware
of
the
advent
of
mademoiselle
habert
on
the
scene
they
concluded
that
the
ambitious
priest
her
brother
had
the
same
matrimonial
plan
for
his
sister
that
the
colonel
was
forming
for
himself
and
sylvie
your
sister
wants
to
get
you
married
said
vinet
to
rogron
with
whom
asked
rogron
with
that
old
sorceress
of
a
schoolmistress
cried
the
colonel
twirling
his
moustache
she
hasn
t
said
anything
to
me
about
it
said
rogron
naively
so
thorough
an
old
maid
as
sylvie
was
certain
to
make
good
progress
in
the
way
of
salvation
the
influence
of
the
priest
would
as
certainly
increase
and
in
the
end
affect
rogron
over
whom
sylvie
had
great
power
the
two
liberals
who
were
naturally
alarmed
saw
plainly
that
if
the
priest
were
resolved
to
marry
his
sister
to
rogron
a
far
more
suitable
marriage
than
that
of
sylvie
to
the
colonel
he
could
then
drive
sylvie
in
extreme
devotion
to
the
church
and
put
pierrette
in
a
convent
they
might
therefore
lose
eighteen
months
labor
in
flattery
and
meannesses
of
all
sorts
their
minds
were
suddenly
filled
with
a
bitter
silent
hatred
to
the
priest
and
his
sister
though
they
felt
the
necessity
of
living
on
good
terms
with
them
in
order
to
track
their
manoeuvres
monsieur
and
mademoiselle
habert
who
could
play
both
whist
and
boston
now
came
every
evening
to
the
rogrons
the
assiduity
of
the
one
pair
induced
the
assiduity
of
the
other
the
colonel
and
lawyer
felt
that
they
were
pitted
against
adversaries
who
were
fully
as
strong
as
they
a
presentiment
that
was
shared
by
the
priest
and
his
sister
the
situation
soon
became
that
of
a
precisely
as
the
colonel
was
enabling
sylvie
to
taste
the
joys
of
being
sought
in
marriage
so
mademoiselle
habert
was
enveloping
the
timid
rogron
in
the
of
her
attentions
words
and
glances
neither
side
could
utter
that
grand
word
of
statesmanship
let
us
divide
for
each
wanted
the
whole
prey
the
two
clever
foxes
of
the
opposition
made
the
mistake
of
pulling
the
first
trigger
vinet
under
the
spur
of
bethought
himself
of
his
wife
s
only
friends
and
looked
up
mademoiselle
de
chargeboeuf
and
her
mother
the
two
women
were
living
in
poverty
at
troyes
on
two
thousand
francs
a
year
mademoiselle
bathilde
de
chargeboeuf
was
one
of
those
fine
creatures
who
believe
in
marriage
for
love
up
to
their
year
and
change
their
opinion
when
they
find
themselves
still
unmarried
vinet
managed
to
persuade
madame
de
chargeboeuf
to
join
her
means
to
his
and
live
with
his
family
in
provins
where
bathilde
he
assured
her
could
marry
a
fool
named
rogron
and
clever
as
she
was
take
her
place
in
the
best
society
of
the
place
the
arrival
of
madame
and
mademoiselle
de
chargeboeuf
in
the
lawyer
s
household
was
a
great
reinforcement
for
the
liberal
party
and
it
created
consternation
among
the
aristocrats
of
provins
and
also
in
the
tiphaine
clique
madame
de
breautey
horrified
to
see
two
women
of
rank
so
misled
begged
them
to
come
to
her
she
was
shocked
that
the
royalists
of
troyes
had
so
neglected
the
mother
and
daughter
whose
situation
she
now
learned
for
the
first
time
how
is
it
that
no
old
country
gentleman
has
married
that
dear
girl
who
is
cut
out
for
a
lady
of
the
manor
she
said
they
have
let
her
run
to
seed
and
now
she
is
to
be
flung
at
the
head
of
a
rogron
she
ransacked
the
whole
department
but
did
not
succeed
in
finding
any
gentleman
willing
to
marry
a
girl
whose
mother
had
only
two
thousand
francs
a
year
the
clique
and
the
subprefect
also
looked
about
them
with
the
same
object
but
they
were
all
too
late
madame
de
breautey
made
terrible
charges
against
the
selfishness
which
degraded
france
the
consequence
she
said
of
materialism
and
of
the
importance
now
given
by
the
laws
to
money
nobility
was
no
longer
of
value
nor
beauty
either
such
creatures
as
the
rogrons
the
vinets
could
stand
up
and
fight
with
the
king
of
france
bathilde
de
chargeboeuf
had
not
only
the
incontestable
superiority
of
beauty
over
her
rival
but
that
of
dress
as
well
she
was
dazzlingly
fair
at
her
shoulders
were
fully
developed
and
the
curves
of
her
beautiful
figure
were
exquisite
the
roundness
of
her
throat
the
purity
of
its
lines
the
wealth
of
her
golden
hair
the
charming
grace
of
her
smile
the
distinguished
carriage
of
her
head
the
character
of
her
features
the
fine
eyes
finely
placed
beneath
a
brow
her
every
motion
noble
and
and
her
light
and
graceful
figure
all
were
in
harmony
her
hands
were
beautiful
and
her
feet
slender
health
gave
her
perhaps
too
much
the
look
of
a
handsome
barmaid
but
that
can
t
be
a
defect
in
the
eyes
of
a
rogron
sighed
madame
tiphaine
mademoiselle
de
chargeboeuf
s
dress
when
she
made
her
first
appearance
in
provins
at
the
rogrons
house
was
very
simple
her
brown
merino
gown
edged
with
green
embroidery
was
worn
but
a
tulle
fichu
carefully
drawn
down
by
hidden
strings
covered
her
neck
and
shoulders
though
it
opened
a
little
in
front
where
its
folds
were
caught
together
with
a
beneath
this
delicate
fabric
bathilde
s
beauties
seemed
all
the
more
enticing
and
coquettish
she
took
off
her
velvet
bonnet
and
her
shawl
on
arriving
and
showed
her
pretty
ears
adorned
with
what
were
then
called
in
gold
she
wore
a
little
a
black
velvet
ribbon
with
a
heart
attached
round
her
throat
where
it
shone
like
the
jet
ring
which
fantastic
nature
had
fastened
round
the
tail
of
a
white
angora
cat
she
knew
all
the
little
tricks
of
a
girl
who
seeks
to
marry
her
fingers
arranged
her
curls
which
were
not
in
the
least
out
of
order
she
entreated
rogron
to
fasten
a
thus
showing
him
her
wrist
a
request
which
that
dazzled
fool
rudely
refused
hiding
his
emotions
under
the
mask
of
indifference
the
timidity
of
the
only
love
he
was
ever
to
feel
in
the
whole
course
of
his
life
took
an
external
appearance
of
dislike
sylvie
and
her
friend
celeste
habert
were
deceived
by
it
not
so
vinet
the
wise
head
of
this
doltish
circle
among
whom
no
one
really
coped
with
him
but
the
priest
the
colonel
being
for
a
long
time
his
ally
on
the
other
hand
the
colonel
was
behaving
to
sylvie
very
much
as
bathilde
behaved
to
rogron
he
put
on
a
clean
shirt
every
evening
and
wore
velvet
stocks
which
set
off
his
martial
features
and
the
spotless
white
of
his
collar
he
adopted
the
fashion
of
white
pique
waistcoats
and
caused
to
be
made
for
him
a
new
surtout
of
blue
cloth
on
which
his
red
rosette
glowed
finely
all
this
under
pretext
of
doing
honor
to
the
new
guests
madame
and
mademoiselle
de
chargeboeuf
he
even
refrained
from
smoking
for
two
hours
previous
to
his
appearance
in
the
rogrons
salon
his
grizzled
hair
was
brushed
in
a
waving
line
across
a
cranium
which
was
ochre
in
tone
he
assumed
the
air
and
manner
of
a
party
leader
of
a
man
who
was
preparing
to
drive
out
the
enemies
of
france
the
bourbons
on
short
to
beat
of
drum
the
satanic
lawyer
and
the
wily
colonel
played
the
priest
and
his
sister
a
more
cruel
trick
than
even
the
importation
of
the
beautiful
madame
de
chargeboeuf
who
was
considered
by
all
the
liberal
party
and
by
madame
de
breautey
and
her
aristocratic
circle
to
be
far
handsomer
than
madame
tiphaine
these
two
great
statesmen
of
the
little
provincial
town
made
everybody
believe
that
the
priest
was
in
sympathy
with
their
ideas
so
that
before
long
provins
began
to
talk
of
him
as
a
liberal
ecclesiastic
as
soon
as
this
news
reached
the
bishop
monsieur
habert
was
sent
for
and
admonished
to
cease
his
visits
to
the
rogrons
but
his
sister
continued
to
go
there
thus
the
salon
rogron
became
a
fixed
fact
and
a
constituted
power
before
the
year
was
out
political
intrigues
were
not
less
lively
than
the
matrimonial
schemes
of
the
rogron
salon
while
the
selfish
interests
hidden
in
these
hearts
were
struggling
in
deadly
combat
the
events
which
resulted
from
them
had
a
fatal
celebrity
everybody
knows
that
the
villele
ministry
was
overthrown
by
the
elections
of
vinet
the
liberal
candidate
at
provins
who
had
borrowed
money
of
his
notary
to
buy
a
domain
which
made
him
eligible
for
election
came
very
near
defeating
monsieur
tiphaine
who
saved
his
election
by
only
two
votes
the
headquarters
of
the
liberals
was
the
rogron
salon
among
the
were
the
notary
cournant
and
his
wife
and
doctor
neraud
whose
youth
was
said
to
have
been
stormy
but
who
now
took
a
serious
view
of
life
he
gave
himself
up
to
study
and
was
according
to
all
liberals
a
far
more
capable
man
than
monsieur
martener
the
aristocratic
physician
as
for
the
rogrons
they
no
more
understood
their
present
triumph
than
they
had
formerly
understood
their
ostracism
the
beautiful
bathilde
to
whom
vinet
had
explained
pierrette
as
an
enemy
was
extremely
disdainful
to
the
girl
it
seemed
as
though
everybody
s
selfish
schemes
demanded
the
humiliation
of
that
poor
victim
madame
vinet
could
do
nothing
for
her
ground
as
she
herself
was
beneath
those
implacable
which
the
lawyer
s
wife
had
come
at
last
to
see
and
comprehend
her
husband
s
imperious
will
had
alone
taken
her
to
the
rogron
s
house
where
she
had
suffered
much
at
the
harsh
treatment
of
the
pretty
little
creature
who
would
often
press
up
against
her
as
if
divining
her
secret
thoughts
sometimes
asking
the
poor
lady
to
show
her
a
stitch
in
knitting
or
to
teach
her
a
bit
of
embroidery
the
child
proved
in
return
that
if
she
were
treated
gently
she
would
understand
what
was
taught
her
and
succeed
in
what
she
tried
to
do
quite
marvellously
but
madame
vinet
was
soon
no
longer
necessary
to
her
husband
s
plans
and
after
the
arrival
of
madame
and
mademoiselle
de
chargeboeuf
she
ceased
to
visit
the
rogrons
sylvie
who
now
indulged
in
the
idea
of
marrying
began
to
consider
pierrette
as
an
obstacle
the
girl
was
nearly
fourteen
the
pallid
whiteness
of
her
skin
a
symptom
of
illness
entirely
overlooked
by
the
ignorant
old
maid
made
her
exquisitely
lovely
sylvie
took
it
into
her
head
to
balance
the
cost
which
pierrette
had
been
to
them
by
making
a
servant
of
her
all
the
of
the
house
to
whom
she
spoke
of
the
matter
advised
that
she
should
send
away
adele
why
shouldn
t
pierrette
take
care
of
the
house
and
cook
if
there
was
too
much
work
at
any
time
mademoiselle
rogron
could
easily
employ
the
colonel
s
an
excellent
cook
and
a
most
respectable
person
pierrette
ought
to
learn
how
to
cook
and
rub
floors
and
sweep
said
the
lawyer
every
girl
should
be
taught
to
keep
house
properly
and
go
to
market
and
know
the
price
of
things
the
poor
little
soul
whose
was
equal
to
her
generosity
offered
herself
willingly
pleased
to
think
that
she
could
earn
the
bitter
bread
which
she
ate
in
that
house
adele
was
sent
away
and
pierrette
thus
lost
the
only
person
who
might
have
protected
her
in
spite
of
the
poor
child
s
strength
of
heart
she
was
henceforth
crushed
down
physically
as
well
as
mentally
her
cousins
had
less
consideration
for
her
than
for
a
servant
she
belonged
to
them
she
was
scolded
for
mere
nothings
for
an
atom
of
dust
left
on
a
glass
globe
or
a
marble
mantelpiece
the
handsome
ornaments
she
had
once
admired
now
became
odious
to
her
no
matter
how
she
strove
to
do
right
her
inexorable
cousins
always
found
something
to
reprove
in
whatever
she
did
in
the
course
of
two
years
pierrette
never
received
the
slightest
praise
or
heard
a
kindly
word
happiness
for
her
lay
in
not
being
scolded
she
bore
with
angelic
patience
the
morose
of
the
two
celibates
to
whom
all
tender
feelings
were
absolutely
unknown
and
who
daily
made
her
feel
her
dependence
on
them
such
a
life
for
a
young
girl
pressed
as
it
were
between
the
two
chops
of
a
vise
increased
her
illness
she
began
to
feel
violent
internal
distresses
secret
pangs
so
sudden
in
their
attacks
that
her
strength
was
undermined
and
her
natural
development
arrested
by
slow
degrees
and
through
dreadful
though
hidden
sufferings
the
poor
child
came
to
the
state
in
which
the
companion
of
her
childhood
found
her
when
he
sang
to
her
his
breton
ditty
at
the
dawn
of
the
october
day
vi
an
old
maid
s
jealousy
before
we
relate
the
domestic
drama
which
the
coming
of
jacques
brigaut
was
destined
to
bring
about
in
the
rogron
family
it
is
best
to
explain
how
the
lad
came
to
be
in
provins
for
he
is
as
it
were
a
somewhat
mute
personage
on
the
scene
when
he
ran
from
the
house
brigaut
was
not
only
frightened
by
pierrette
s
gesture
he
was
horrified
by
the
change
he
saw
in
his
little
friend
he
could
scarcely
recognize
the
voice
the
eyes
the
gestures
that
were
once
so
lively
gay
and
withal
so
tender
when
he
had
gained
some
distance
from
the
house
his
legs
began
to
tremble
under
him
hot
flushes
ran
down
his
back
he
had
seen
the
shadow
of
pierrette
but
not
pierrette
herself
the
lad
climbed
to
the
upper
town
till
he
found
a
spot
from
which
he
could
see
the
square
and
the
house
where
pierrette
lived
he
gazed
at
it
mournfully
lost
in
many
thoughts
as
though
he
were
entering
some
grief
of
which
he
could
not
see
the
end
pierrette
was
ill
she
was
not
happy
she
pined
for
brittany
what
was
the
matter
with
her
all
these
questions
passed
and
repassed
through
his
heart
and
rent
it
revealing
to
his
own
soul
the
extent
of
his
love
for
his
little
adopted
sister
it
is
extremely
rare
to
find
a
passion
existing
between
two
children
of
opposite
sexes
the
charming
story
of
paul
and
virginia
does
not
any
more
than
this
of
pierrette
and
brigaut
answer
the
question
put
by
that
strange
moral
fact
modern
history
offers
only
the
illustrious
instance
of
the
marchesa
di
pescara
and
her
husband
destined
to
marry
by
their
parents
from
their
earliest
years
they
adored
each
other
and
were
married
and
their
union
gave
to
the
sixteenth
century
the
noble
spectacle
of
a
perfect
conjugal
love
without
a
flaw
when
the
marchesa
became
a
widow
at
the
age
of
beautiful
intellectually
brilliant
universally
adored
she
refused
to
marry
sovereigns
and
buried
herself
in
a
convent
seeing
and
knowing
thenceforth
only
nuns
such
was
the
perfect
love
that
suddenly
developed
itself
in
the
heart
of
the
breton
workman
pierrette
and
he
had
often
protected
each
other
with
what
bliss
had
he
given
her
the
money
for
her
journey
he
had
almost
killed
himself
by
running
after
the
diligence
when
she
left
him
pierrette
had
known
nothing
of
all
that
but
for
him
the
recollection
had
warmed
and
comforted
the
cold
hard
life
he
had
led
for
the
last
three
years
for
pierrette
s
sake
he
had
struggled
to
improve
himself
he
had
learned
his
trade
for
pierrette
he
had
come
to
paris
for
pierrette
intending
to
make
his
fortune
for
after
spending
a
fortnight
in
the
city
he
had
not
been
able
to
hold
out
against
the
desire
to
see
her
and
he
had
walked
from
saturday
night
to
monday
morning
he
intended
to
return
to
paris
but
the
moving
sight
of
his
little
friend
nailed
him
to
provins
a
wonderful
magnetism
still
denied
in
spite
of
many
proofs
acted
upon
him
without
his
knowledge
tears
rolled
from
his
eyes
when
they
rose
in
hers
if
to
her
he
was
brittany
and
her
happy
childhood
to
him
she
was
life
itself
at
sixteen
years
of
age
brigaut
did
not
yet
know
how
to
draw
or
to
model
a
cornice
he
was
ignorant
of
much
but
he
had
earned
by
done
in
the
leisure
of
his
apprenticeship
some
four
or
five
francs
a
day
on
this
he
could
live
in
provins
and
be
near
pierrette
he
would
choose
the
best
in
the
town
and
learn
the
rest
of
his
trade
in
working
for
him
and
thus
keep
watch
over
his
darling
brigaut
s
mind
was
made
up
as
he
sat
there
thinking
he
went
back
to
paris
and
fetched
his
certificate
tools
and
baggage
and
three
days
later
he
was
a
journeyman
in
the
establishment
of
monsieur
frappier
the
best
in
provins
active
steady
workmen
not
given
to
junketing
and
taverns
are
so
rare
that
masters
hold
to
young
men
like
brigaut
when
they
find
them
to
end
brigaut
s
history
on
this
point
we
will
say
here
that
by
the
end
of
the
month
he
was
made
foreman
and
was
fed
and
lodged
by
frappier
who
taught
him
arithmetic
and
line
drawing
the
house
and
shop
were
in
the
grand
rue
not
a
hundred
feet
from
the
little
square
where
pierrette
lived
brigaut
buried
his
love
in
his
heart
and
committed
no
imprudence
he
made
madame
frappier
tell
him
all
she
knew
about
the
rogrons
among
other
things
she
related
to
him
the
way
in
which
their
father
had
laid
hands
on
the
property
of
old
auffray
pierrette
s
grandfather
brigaut
obtained
other
information
as
to
the
character
of
the
brother
and
sister
he
met
pierrette
sometimes
in
the
market
with
her
cousin
and
shuddered
to
see
the
heavy
basket
she
was
carrying
on
her
arm
on
sundays
he
went
to
church
to
look
for
her
dressed
in
her
best
clothes
there
for
the
first
time
he
became
aware
that
pierrette
was
mademoiselle
lorrain
pierrette
saw
him
and
made
him
a
hasty
sign
to
keep
out
of
sight
to
him
there
was
a
world
of
things
in
that
little
gesture
as
there
had
been
a
fortnight
earlier
in
the
sign
by
which
she
told
him
from
her
window
to
run
away
ah
what
a
fortune
he
must
make
in
the
coming
ten
years
in
order
to
marry
his
little
friend
to
whom
he
was
told
the
rogrons
were
to
leave
their
house
a
hundred
acres
of
land
and
twelve
thousand
francs
a
year
not
counting
their
savings
the
persevering
breton
was
determined
to
be
thoroughly
educated
for
his
trade
and
he
set
about
acquiring
all
the
knowledge
that
he
lacked
as
long
as
only
the
principles
of
his
work
were
concerned
he
could
learn
those
in
provins
as
well
as
in
paris
and
thus
remain
near
pierrette
to
whom
he
now
became
anxious
to
explain
his
projects
and
the
sort
of
protection
she
could
rely
on
from
him
he
was
determined
to
know
the
reason
of
her
pallor
and
of
the
debility
which
was
beginning
to
appear
in
the
organ
which
is
always
the
last
to
show
the
signs
of
failing
life
namely
the
eyes
he
would
know
too
the
cause
of
the
sufferings
which
gave
her
that
look
as
though
death
were
near
and
she
might
drop
at
any
moment
beneath
its
scythe
the
two
signs
the
two
gestures
not
denying
their
friendship
but
imploring
caution
alarmed
the
young
breton
evidently
pierrette
wished
him
to
wait
and
not
attempt
to
see
her
otherwise
there
was
danger
there
was
peril
for
her
as
she
left
the
church
she
was
able
to
give
him
one
look
and
brigaut
saw
that
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
but
he
could
have
sooner
squared
the
circle
than
have
guessed
what
had
happened
in
the
rogrons
house
during
the
fortnight
which
had
elapsed
since
his
arrival
it
was
not
without
keen
apprehension
that
pierrette
came
downstairs
on
the
morning
after
brigaut
had
invaded
her
morning
dreams
like
another
dream
she
was
certain
that
her
cousin
sylvie
must
have
heard
the
song
or
she
would
not
have
risen
and
opened
her
window
but
pierrette
was
ignorant
of
the
powerful
reasons
that
made
the
old
maid
so
alert
for
the
last
eight
days
strange
events
and
bitter
feelings
agitated
the
minds
of
the
chief
personages
who
frequented
the
rogron
salon
these
hidden
matters
carefully
concealed
by
all
concerned
were
destined
to
fall
in
their
results
like
an
avalanche
on
pierrette
such
mysterious
things
which
we
ought
perhaps
to
call
the
putrescence
of
the
human
heart
lie
at
the
base
of
the
greatest
revolutions
political
social
or
domestic
but
in
telling
of
them
it
is
desirable
to
explain
that
their
subtle
significance
can
not
be
given
in
a
narrative
these
secret
schemes
and
calculations
do
not
show
themselves
as
brutally
and
undisguisedly
while
taking
place
as
they
must
when
the
history
of
them
is
related
to
set
down
in
writing
the
circumlocutions
oratorical
precautions
protracted
conversations
and
honeyed
words
glossed
over
the
venom
of
intentions
would
make
as
long
a
book
as
that
magnificent
poem
called
clarissa
mademoiselle
habert
and
mademoiselle
sylvie
were
equally
desirous
of
marrying
but
one
was
ten
years
older
than
the
other
and
the
probabilities
of
life
allowed
celeste
habert
to
expect
that
her
children
would
inherit
all
the
rogron
property
sylvie
was
an
age
at
which
marriage
is
beset
by
perils
in
confiding
to
each
other
their
ideas
celeste
instigated
by
her
vindictive
brother
the
priest
enlightened
sylvie
as
to
the
dangers
she
would
incur
sylvie
trembled
she
was
terribly
afraid
of
death
an
idea
which
shakes
all
celibates
to
their
centre
but
just
at
this
time
the
martignac
ministry
came
into
power
a
liberal
victory
which
overthrew
the
villele
administration
the
vinet
party
now
carried
their
heads
high
in
provins
vinet
himself
became
a
personage
the
liberals
prophesied
his
advancement
he
would
certainly
be
deputy
and
as
for
the
colonel
he
would
be
made
mayor
of
provins
ah
to
reign
as
madame
garceland
the
wife
of
the
present
mayor
now
reigned
sylvie
could
not
hold
out
against
that
hope
she
determined
to
consult
a
doctor
though
the
proceeding
would
only
cover
her
with
ridicule
to
consult
monsieur
neraud
the
liberal
physician
and
the
rival
of
monsieur
martener
would
be
a
blunder
celeste
habert
offered
to
hide
sylvie
in
her
while
she
herself
consulted
monsieur
martener
the
physician
of
her
establishment
on
this
difficult
matter
whether
martener
was
or
was
not
celeste
s
accomplice
need
not
be
discovered
at
any
rate
he
told
his
client
that
even
at
thirty
the
danger
though
slight
did
exist
but
he
added
with
your
constitution
you
need
fear
but
how
about
a
woman
over
forty
asked
mademoiselle
celeste
a
married
woman
who
has
had
children
has
nothing
to
but
i
mean
an
unmarried
woman
like
mademoiselle
rogron
for
instance
oh
that
s
another
thing
said
monsieur
martener
successful
childbirth
is
then
one
of
those
miracles
which
god
sometimes
allows
himself
but
why
asked
celeste
the
doctor
answered
with
a
terrifying
pathological
description
he
explained
that
the
elasticity
given
by
nature
to
youthful
muscles
and
bones
did
not
exist
at
a
later
age
especially
in
women
whose
lives
were
sedentary
so
you
think
that
an
unmarried
woman
ought
not
to
marry
after
forty
not
unless
she
waits
some
years
replied
the
doctor
but
then
of
course
it
is
not
marriage
it
is
only
an
association
of
the
result
of
the
interview
clearly
seriously
scientifically
and
sensibly
stated
was
that
an
unmarried
woman
would
make
a
great
mistake
in
marrying
after
forty
when
the
doctor
had
departed
mademoiselle
celeste
found
sylvie
in
a
frightful
state
green
and
yellow
and
with
the
pupils
of
her
eyes
dilated
then
you
really
love
the
colonel
asked
celeste
i
still
hoped
replied
sylvie
well
then
wait
cried
mademoiselle
habert
jesuitically
aware
that
time
would
rid
her
of
the
colonel
sylvie
s
new
devotion
to
the
church
warned
her
that
the
morality
of
such
a
marriage
might
be
doubtful
she
accordingly
sounded
her
conscience
in
the
confessional
the
stern
priest
explained
the
opinions
of
the
church
which
sees
in
marriage
only
the
propagation
of
humanity
and
rebukes
second
marriages
and
all
passions
but
those
with
a
social
purpose
sylvie
s
perplexities
were
great
these
internal
struggles
gave
extraordinary
force
to
her
passion
investing
it
with
that
inexplicable
attraction
which
from
the
days
of
eve
the
thing
forbidden
possesses
for
women
mademoiselle
rogron
s
perturbation
did
not
escape
the
lawyer
one
evening
after
the
game
had
ended
vinet
approached
his
dear
friend
sylvie
took
her
hand
and
led
her
to
a
sofa
something
troubles
you
he
said
she
nodded
sadly
the
lawyer
let
the
others
depart
rogron
walked
home
with
the
chargeboeufs
and
when
vinet
was
alone
with
the
old
maid
he
wormed
the
truth
out
of
her
cleverly
played
abbe
thought
he
but
you
ve
played
into
my
the
foxy
lawyer
was
more
decided
in
his
opinion
than
even
the
doctor
he
advised
marriage
in
ten
years
inwardly
he
was
vowing
that
the
whole
rogron
fortune
should
go
to
bathilde
he
rubbed
his
hands
his
pinched
lips
closed
more
tightly
as
he
hurried
home
the
influence
exercised
by
monsieur
habert
physician
of
the
soul
and
by
vinet
doctor
of
the
purse
balanced
each
other
perfectly
rogron
had
no
piety
in
him
so
the
churchman
and
the
man
of
law
the
pair
were
fairly
matched
on
discovering
the
victory
obtained
by
celeste
in
her
anxiety
to
marry
rogron
herself
over
sylvie
torn
between
the
fear
of
death
and
the
joy
of
being
baronness
and
mayoress
the
lawyer
saw
his
chance
of
driving
the
colonel
from
the
battlefield
he
knew
rogron
well
enough
to
be
certain
he
could
marry
him
to
bathilde
jerome
had
already
succumbed
inwardly
to
her
charms
and
vinet
knew
that
the
first
time
the
pair
were
alone
together
the
marriage
would
be
settled
rogron
had
reached
the
point
of
keeping
his
eyes
fixed
on
celeste
so
much
did
he
fear
to
look
at
bathilde
vinet
had
now
possessed
himself
of
sylvie
s
secrets
and
saw
the
force
with
which
she
loved
the
colonel
he
fully
understood
the
struggle
of
such
a
passion
in
the
heart
of
an
old
maid
who
was
also
in
the
grasp
of
religious
emotion
and
he
saw
his
way
to
rid
himself
of
pierrette
and
the
colonel
both
by
making
each
the
cause
of
the
other
s
overthrow
the
next
day
after
the
court
had
risen
vinet
met
the
colonel
and
rogron
talking
a
walk
together
according
to
their
daily
custom
whenever
the
three
men
were
seen
in
company
the
whole
town
talked
of
it
this
triumvirate
held
in
horror
by
the
the
magistracy
and
the
tiphaine
clique
was
on
the
other
hand
a
source
of
pride
and
vanity
to
the
liberals
of
provins
vinet
was
sole
editor
of
the
courrier
and
the
head
of
the
party
the
colonel
the
working
manager
was
its
arm
rogron
by
means
of
his
purse
its
nerves
the
tiphaines
declared
that
the
three
men
were
always
plotting
evil
to
the
government
the
liberals
admired
them
as
the
defenders
of
the
people
when
rogron
turned
to
go
home
recalled
by
a
sense
of
his
vinet
stopped
the
colonel
from
following
him
by
taking
gouraud
s
arm
well
colonel
he
said
i
am
going
to
take
a
fearful
load
off
your
shoulders
you
can
do
better
than
marry
sylvie
if
you
play
your
cards
properly
you
can
marry
that
little
pierrette
in
two
years
he
thereupon
related
the
jesuit
s
manoeuvre
and
its
effect
on
sylvie
what
a
skulking
trick
cried
the
colonel
and
spreading
over
years
too
colonel
said
vinet
gravely
pierrette
is
a
charming
creature
with
her
you
can
be
happy
for
the
rest
of
your
life
your
health
is
so
sound
that
the
difference
in
your
ages
won
t
seem
disproportionate
but
all
the
same
you
mustn
t
think
it
an
easy
thing
to
change
a
dreadful
fate
to
a
pleasant
one
to
turn
a
woman
who
loves
you
into
a
friend
and
confidant
is
as
perilous
a
business
as
crossing
a
river
under
fire
of
the
enemy
cavalry
colonel
as
you
are
and
daring
too
you
must
study
the
position
and
manoeuvre
your
forces
with
the
same
wisdom
you
have
displayed
hitherto
and
which
has
won
us
our
present
position
if
i
get
to
be
you
shall
command
the
department
oh
if
you
had
been
an
elector
we
should
be
further
advanced
than
we
are
now
i
should
have
bought
the
votes
of
those
two
clerks
by
threatening
them
with
the
loss
of
their
places
and
we
should
have
had
a
the
colonel
had
long
been
thinking
about
pierrette
but
he
concealed
his
thoughts
with
the
utmost
dissimulation
his
roughness
to
the
child
was
only
a
mask
but
she
could
not
understand
why
the
man
who
claimed
to
be
her
father
s
old
comrade
should
usually
treat
her
so
ill
when
sometimes
if
he
met
her
alone
he
would
chuck
her
under
the
chin
and
give
her
a
friendly
kiss
but
after
the
conversation
with
vinet
relating
to
sylvie
s
fears
of
marriage
gouraud
began
to
seek
opportunities
to
find
pierrette
alone
the
rough
colonel
made
himself
as
soft
as
a
cat
he
told
her
how
brave
her
father
was
and
what
a
misfortune
it
had
been
for
her
that
she
lost
him
a
few
days
before
brigaut
s
arrival
sylvie
had
come
suddenly
upon
gouraud
and
pierrette
talking
together
instantly
jealousy
rushed
into
her
heart
with
monastic
violence
jealousy
eminently
credulous
and
suspicious
is
the
passion
in
which
fancy
has
most
freedom
but
for
all
that
it
does
not
give
a
person
intelligence
on
the
contrary
it
hinders
them
from
having
any
and
in
sylvie
s
case
jealousy
only
filled
her
with
fantastic
ideas
when
a
few
mornings
later
she
heard
brigaut
s
ditty
she
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
the
man
who
had
used
the
words
madam
le
mariee
addressing
them
to
pierrette
must
be
the
colonel
she
was
certain
she
was
right
for
she
had
noticed
for
a
week
past
a
change
in
his
manners
he
was
the
only
man
who
in
her
solitary
life
had
ever
paid
her
any
attention
consequently
she
watched
him
with
all
her
eyes
all
her
mind
and
by
giving
herself
up
to
hopes
that
were
sometimes
flourishing
sometimes
blighted
she
had
brought
the
matter
to
such
enormous
proportions
that
she
saw
all
things
in
a
mental
mirage
to
use
a
common
but
excellent
expression
by
dint
of
looking
intently
she
saw
nothing
alternately
she
repelled
admitted
and
conquered
the
supposition
of
this
rivalry
she
compared
herself
with
pierrette
she
was
years
old
with
gray
hair
pierrette
was
delicately
fair
with
eyes
soft
enough
to
warm
a
withered
heart
she
had
heard
it
said
that
men
of
fifty
were
apt
to
love
young
girls
of
just
that
kind
before
the
colonel
had
come
regularly
to
the
house
sylvie
had
heard
in
the
tiphaines
salon
strange
stories
of
his
life
and
morals
old
maids
preserve
in
their
the
exaggerated
platonic
sentiments
which
young
girls
of
twenty
are
wont
to
profess
they
hold
to
these
fixed
doctrines
like
all
who
have
little
experience
of
life
and
no
personal
knowledge
of
how
great
social
forces
modify
impair
and
bring
to
nought
such
grand
and
noble
ideas
the
mere
thought
of
being
jilted
by
the
colonel
was
torture
to
sylvie
s
brain
she
lay
in
her
bed
going
over
and
over
her
own
desires
pierrette
s
conduct
and
the
song
which
had
awakened
her
with
the
word
like
the
fool
she
was
instead
of
looking
through
the
blinds
to
see
the
lover
she
opened
her
window
without
reflecting
that
pierrette
would
hear
her
if
she
had
had
the
common
instinct
of
a
spy
she
would
have
seen
brigaut
and
the
fatal
drama
then
begun
would
never
have
taken
place
it
was
pierrette
s
duty
weak
as
she
was
to
take
down
the
bars
that
closed
the
wooden
shutters
of
the
kitchen
which
she
opened
and
fastened
back
then
she
opened
in
like
manner
the
glass
door
leading
from
the
corridor
to
the
garden
she
took
the
various
brooms
that
were
used
for
sweeping
the
carpets
the
the
passages
and
stairs
together
with
the
other
utensils
with
a
care
and
particularity
which
no
servant
not
even
a
dutchwoman
gives
to
her
work
she
hated
reproof
happiness
for
her
was
in
seeing
the
cold
blue
pallid
eyes
of
her
cousin
not
satisfied
that
they
never
were
but
calm
after
glancing
about
her
with
the
look
of
an
owner
that
wonderful
glance
which
sees
what
escapes
even
the
most
vigilant
eyes
of
others
pierrette
s
skin
was
moist
with
her
labor
when
she
returned
to
the
kitchen
to
put
it
in
order
and
light
the
stove
that
she
might
carry
up
hot
water
to
her
two
cousins
a
luxury
she
never
had
for
herself
and
the
means
of
lighting
fires
in
their
rooms
after
this
she
laid
the
table
for
breakfast
and
lit
the
stove
in
the
for
all
these
various
fires
she
had
to
fetch
wood
and
kindling
from
the
cellar
leaving
the
warm
rooms
for
a
damp
and
chilly
atmosphere
such
sudden
transitions
made
with
the
quickness
of
youth
often
to
escape
a
harsh
word
or
obey
an
order
aggravated
the
condition
of
her
health
she
did
not
know
she
was
ill
and
yet
she
suffered
she
began
to
have
strange
cravings
she
liked
raw
vegetables
and
salads
and
ate
them
secretly
the
innocent
child
was
quite
unaware
that
her
condition
was
that
of
serious
illness
which
needed
the
utmost
care
if
neraud
the
rogrons
doctor
had
told
this
to
pierrette
before
brigaut
s
arrival
she
would
only
have
smiled
life
was
so
bitter
she
could
smile
at
death
but
now
her
feelings
changed
the
child
to
whose
physical
sufferings
was
added
the
anguish
of
breton
homesickness
a
moral
malady
so
that
colonels
in
the
army
allow
for
it
among
their
men
was
suddenly
content
to
be
in
provins
the
sight
of
that
yellow
flower
the
song
the
presence
of
her
friend
revived
her
as
a
plant
long
without
water
revives
under
rain
unconsciously
she
wanted
to
live
and
even
thought
she
did
not
suffer
pierrette
slipped
timidly
into
her
cousin
s
bedroom
made
the
fire
left
the
hot
water
said
a
few
words
and
went
to
wake
rogron
and
do
the
same
offices
for
him
then
she
went
down
to
take
in
the
milk
the
bread
and
the
other
provisions
left
by
the
dealers
she
stood
some
time
on
the
sill
of
the
door
hoping
that
brigaut
would
have
the
sense
to
come
to
her
but
by
that
time
he
was
already
on
his
way
to
paris
she
had
finished
the
arrangement
of
the
and
was
busy
in
the
kitchen
when
she
heard
her
cousin
sylvie
coming
down
mademoiselle
rogron
appeared
in
a
brown
silk
and
a
cap
with
bows
her
false
front
was
awry
her
showed
above
the
silk
wrapper
her
slippers
were
down
at
heel
she
gave
an
eye
to
everything
and
then
came
straight
to
pierrette
who
was
awaiting
her
orders
to
know
what
to
prepare
for
breakfast
ha
here
you
are
lovesick
young
lady
said
sylvie
in
a
mocking
tone
what
is
it
cousin
you
came
into
my
room
like
a
sly
cat
and
you
crept
out
the
same
way
though
you
knew
very
well
i
had
something
to
say
to
to
me
you
had
a
serenade
this
morning
as
if
you
were
a
a
serenade
exclaimed
pierrette
a
serenade
said
sylvie
mimicking
her
and
you
ve
a
lover
what
is
a
lover
cousin
sylvie
avoided
answering
and
said
do
you
dare
to
tell
me
mademoiselle
that
a
man
did
not
come
under
your
window
and
talk
to
you
of
marriage
persecution
had
taught
pierrette
the
wariness
of
slaves
so
she
answered
bravely
i
don
t
know
what
you
mean
who
means
your
dog
said
sylvie
sharply
i
should
have
said
cousin
replied
the
girl
humbly
and
didn
t
you
get
up
and
go
in
your
bare
feet
to
the
window
which
will
give
you
an
illness
and
serve
you
right
too
and
perhaps
you
didn
t
talk
to
your
lover
either
no
i
know
you
have
many
faults
but
i
did
not
think
you
told
lies
you
had
better
think
this
over
mademoiselle
you
will
have
to
explain
this
affair
to
your
cousin
and
to
me
or
your
cousin
will
be
obliged
to
take
severe
the
old
maid
exasperated
by
jealousy
and
curiosity
meant
to
frighten
the
girl
pierrette
like
all
those
who
suffer
more
than
they
have
strength
to
bear
kept
silence
silence
is
the
only
weapon
by
which
such
victims
can
conquer
it
baffles
the
cossack
charges
of
envy
the
savage
skirmishings
of
suspicion
it
does
at
times
give
victory
crushing
and
complete
for
what
is
more
complete
than
silence
it
is
absolute
it
is
one
of
the
attributes
of
infinity
sylvie
watched
pierrette
narrowly
the
girl
colored
but
the
color
instead
of
rising
evenly
came
out
in
patches
on
her
cheekbones
in
burning
and
significant
spots
a
mother
seeing
that
symptom
of
illness
would
have
changed
her
tone
at
once
she
would
have
taken
the
child
on
her
lap
and
questioned
her
in
fact
she
would
long
ago
have
tenderly
understood
the
signs
of
pierrette
s
pure
and
perfect
innocence
she
would
have
seen
her
weakness
and
known
that
the
disturbance
of
the
digestive
organs
and
the
other
functions
of
the
body
was
about
to
affect
the
lungs
those
eloquent
patches
would
have
warned
her
of
an
imminent
danger
but
an
old
maid
one
in
whom
the
family
instincts
have
never
been
awakened
to
whom
the
needs
of
childhood
and
the
precautions
required
for
adolescence
were
unknown
had
neither
the
indulgence
nor
the
compassionate
intelligence
of
a
mother
such
sufferings
as
those
of
pierrette
instead
of
softening
her
heart
only
made
it
more
callous
she
blushes
she
is
guilty
thought
sylvie
pierrette
s
silence
was
thus
interpreted
to
her
injury
pierrette
continued
sylvie
before
your
cousin
comes
down
we
must
have
some
talk
together
come
she
said
in
a
rather
softer
tone
shut
the
street
door
if
any
one
comes
they
will
rung
and
we
shall
hear
in
spite
of
the
damp
mist
which
was
rising
from
the
river
sylvie
took
pierrette
along
the
winding
gravel
path
which
led
across
the
lawn
to
the
edge
of
the
rock
terrace
a
picturesque
little
quay
covered
with
iris
and
aquatic
plants
she
now
changed
her
tactics
thinking
she
might
catch
pierrette
tripping
by
softness
the
hyena
became
a
cat
pierrette
she
said
you
are
no
longer
a
child
you
are
nearly
fifteen
and
it
is
not
at
all
surprising
that
you
should
have
a
but
cousin
said
pierrette
raising
her
eyes
with
angelic
sweetness
to
the
cold
sour
face
of
her
cousin
what
is
a
lover
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
sylvie
to
define
a
lover
with
truth
and
decency
to
the
girl
s
mind
instead
of
seeing
in
that
question
the
proof
of
adorable
innocence
she
considered
it
a
piece
of
insincerity
a
lover
pierrette
is
a
man
who
loves
us
and
wishes
to
marry
ah
said
pierrette
when
that
happens
in
brittany
we
call
the
young
man
a
well
remember
that
in
owning
your
feelings
for
a
man
you
do
no
wrong
my
dear
the
wrong
is
in
hiding
them
have
you
pleased
some
of
the
men
who
visit
here
i
don
t
think
so
do
you
love
any
of
them
certain
quite
look
at
me
pierrette
looked
at
sylvie
a
man
called
to
you
this
morning
in
the
pierrette
lowered
her
eyes
you
went
to
your
window
you
opened
it
and
you
spoke
to
no
cousin
i
went
to
look
out
and
i
saw
a
pierrette
you
have
much
improved
since
you
made
your
first
communion
you
have
become
pious
and
obedient
you
love
god
and
your
relations
i
am
satisfied
with
you
i
don
t
say
this
to
puff
you
up
with
the
horrible
creature
had
mistaken
despondency
submission
the
silence
of
wretchedness
for
virtues
the
sweetest
of
all
consolations
to
suffering
souls
to
martyrs
to
artists
in
the
worst
of
that
divine
agony
which
hatred
and
envy
force
upon
them
is
to
meet
with
praise
where
they
have
hitherto
found
censure
and
injustice
pierrette
raised
her
grateful
eyes
to
her
cousin
feeling
that
she
could
almost
forgive
her
for
the
sufferings
she
had
caused
but
if
it
is
all
hypocrisy
if
i
find
you
a
serpent
that
i
have
warmed
in
my
bosom
you
will
be
a
wicked
girl
an
infamous
creature
i
think
i
have
nothing
to
reproach
myself
with
said
pierrette
with
a
painful
revulsion
of
her
heart
at
the
sudden
change
from
unexpected
praise
to
the
tones
of
the
hyena
you
know
that
to
lie
is
a
mortal
sin
yes
well
you
are
now
under
the
eye
of
god
said
the
old
maid
with
a
solemn
gesture
towards
the
sky
swear
to
me
that
you
did
not
know
that
i
will
not
swear
said
pierrette
ha
he
was
no
peasant
you
little
pierrette
rushed
away
like
a
frightened
fawn
terrified
at
her
tone
sylvie
called
her
in
a
dreadful
voice
the
bell
is
ringing
she
answered
artful
wretch
thought
sylvie
she
is
depraved
in
mind
and
now
i
am
certain
the
little
adder
has
wound
herself
round
the
colonel
she
has
heard
us
say
he
was
a
baron
to
be
a
baroness
little
fool
ah
i
ll
get
rid
of
her
i
ll
apprentice
her
out
and
soon
too
sylvie
was
so
lost
in
thought
that
she
did
not
notice
her
brother
coming
down
the
path
and
bemoaning
the
injury
the
frost
had
done
to
his
dahlias
sylvie
what
are
you
thinking
about
i
thought
you
were
looking
at
the
fish
sometimes
they
jump
out
of
the
no
said
sylvie
how
did
you
sleep
and
he
began
to
tell
her
about
his
own
dreams
don
t
you
think
my
skin
is
getting
a
word
in
the
rogron
vocabulary
ever
since
rogron
had
been
in
love
but
let
us
not
profane
the
word
ever
since
he
had
desired
to
marry
mademoiselle
de
chargeboeuf
he
was
very
uneasy
about
himself
and
his
health
at
this
moment
pierrette
came
down
the
garden
steps
and
called
to
them
from
a
distance
that
breakfast
was
ready
at
sight
of
her
cousin
sylvie
s
skin
turned
green
and
yellow
her
bile
was
in
commotion
she
looked
at
the
floor
of
the
corridor
and
declared
that
pierrette
ought
to
rub
it
i
will
rub
it
now
if
you
wish
said
the
little
angel
not
aware
of
the
injury
such
work
may
do
to
a
young
girl
the
was
irreproachably
in
order
sylvie
sat
down
and
pretended
all
through
breakfast
to
want
this
that
and
the
other
thing
which
she
would
never
have
thought
of
in
a
quieter
moment
and
which
she
now
asked
for
only
to
make
pierrette
rise
again
and
again
just
as
the
child
was
beginning
to
eat
her
food
but
such
mere
teasing
was
not
enough
she
wanted
a
subject
on
which
to
find
fault
and
was
angry
with
herself
for
not
finding
one
she
scarcely
answered
her
brother
s
silly
remarks
yet
she
looked
at
him
only
her
eyes
avoided
pierrette
pierrette
was
deeply
conscious
of
all
this
she
brought
the
milk
mixed
with
cream
for
each
cousin
in
a
large
silver
goblet
after
heating
it
carefully
in
the
the
brother
and
sister
poured
in
the
coffee
made
by
sylvie
herself
on
the
table
when
sylvie
had
carefully
prepared
hers
she
saw
an
atom
of
floating
on
the
surface
on
this
the
storm
broke
forth
what
is
the
matter
asked
rogron
the
matter
is
that
mademoiselle
has
put
dust
in
my
milk
do
you
suppose
i
am
going
to
drink
coffee
with
ashes
in
it
well
i
am
not
surprised
no
one
can
do
two
things
at
once
she
wasn
t
thinking
of
the
milk
a
blackbird
might
have
flown
through
the
kitchen
and
she
wouldn
t
have
seen
it
how
should
she
see
the
dust
flying
and
then
it
was
my
coffee
ha
that
didn
t
signify
as
she
spoke
she
was
laying
on
the
side
of
her
plate
the
that
had
run
through
the
filter
but
cousin
that
is
coffee
said
pierrette
oh
then
it
is
i
who
tell
lies
is
it
cried
sylvie
looking
at
pierrette
and
blasting
her
with
a
fearful
flash
of
anger
from
her
eyes
organizations
which
have
not
been
exhausted
by
powerful
emotions
often
have
a
vast
amount
of
the
vital
fluid
at
their
service
this
phenomenon
of
the
extreme
clearness
of
the
eye
in
moments
of
anger
was
the
more
marked
in
mademoiselle
rogron
because
she
had
often
exercised
the
power
of
her
eyes
in
her
shop
by
opening
them
to
their
full
extent
for
the
purpose
of
inspiring
her
dependents
with
salutary
fear
you
had
better
dare
to
give
me
the
lie
continued
sylvie
you
deserve
to
be
sent
from
the
table
to
go
and
eat
by
yourself
in
the
what
s
the
matter
with
you
two
cried
rogron
you
are
as
cross
as
bears
this
mademoiselle
knows
what
i
have
against
her
said
sylvie
i
leave
her
to
make
up
her
mind
before
speaking
to
you
for
i
mean
to
show
her
more
kindness
than
she
pierrette
was
looking
out
of
the
window
to
avoid
her
cousin
s
eyes
which
frightened
her
look
at
her
she
pays
no
more
attention
to
what
i
am
saying
than
if
i
were
that
and
yet
mademoiselle
has
a
sharp
ear
she
can
hear
and
answer
from
the
top
of
the
house
when
some
one
talks
to
her
from
below
she
is
perversity
itself
perversity
i
say
and
you
needn
t
expect
any
good
of
her
do
you
hear
me
jerome
what
has
she
done
wrong
asked
rogron
at
her
age
too
to
begin
so
young
screamed
the
angry
old
maid
pierrette
rose
to
clear
the
table
and
give
herself
something
to
do
for
she
could
hardly
bear
the
scene
any
longer
though
such
language
was
not
new
to
her
she
had
never
been
able
to
get
used
to
it
her
cousin
s
rage
seemed
to
accuse
her
of
some
crime
she
imagined
what
her
fury
would
be
if
she
came
to
know
about
brigaut
perhaps
her
cousin
would
have
him
sent
away
and
she
should
lose
him
all
the
many
thoughts
the
deep
and
rapid
thoughts
of
a
slave
came
to
her
and
she
resolved
to
keep
absolute
silence
about
a
circumstance
in
which
her
conscience
told
her
there
was
nothing
wrong
but
the
cruel
bitter
words
she
had
been
made
to
hear
and
the
wounding
suspicion
so
shocked
her
that
as
she
reached
the
kitchen
she
was
taken
with
a
convulsion
of
the
stomach
and
turned
deadly
sick
she
dared
not
complain
she
was
not
sure
that
any
one
would
help
her
when
she
returned
to
the
she
was
white
as
a
sheet
and
saying
she
was
not
well
she
started
to
go
to
bed
dragging
herself
up
step
by
step
by
the
baluster
and
thinking
that
she
was
going
to
die
poor
brigaut
she
thought
the
girl
is
ill
said
rogron
she
ill
that
s
only
replied
sylvie
in
a
loud
voice
that
pierrette
might
hear
she
was
well
enough
this
morning
i
can
tell
this
last
blow
struck
pierrette
to
the
earth
she
went
to
bed
weeping
and
praying
to
god
to
take
her
out
of
this
world
vii
domestic
tyranny
for
a
month
past
rogron
had
ceased
to
carry
the
constitutionnel
to
gouraud
the
colonel
came
obsequiously
to
fetch
his
paper
gossip
a
little
and
take
rogron
off
to
walk
if
the
weather
was
fine
sure
of
seeing
the
colonel
and
being
able
to
question
him
sylvie
dressed
herself
as
coquettishly
as
she
knew
how
the
old
maid
thought
she
was
attractive
in
a
green
gown
a
yellow
shawl
with
a
red
border
and
a
white
bonnet
with
straggling
gray
feathers
about
the
hour
when
the
colonel
usually
came
sylvie
stationed
herself
in
the
salon
with
her
brother
whom
she
had
compelled
to
stay
in
the
house
in
his
and
slippers
it
is
a
fine
day
colonel
said
rogron
when
gouraud
with
his
heavy
step
entered
the
room
but
i
m
not
dressed
my
sister
wanted
to
go
out
and
i
was
going
to
keep
the
house
wait
for
me
i
ll
be
ready
so
saying
rogron
left
sylvie
alone
with
the
colonel
where
were
you
going
you
are
dressed
divinely
said
gouraud
who
noticed
a
certain
solemnity
on
the
face
of
the
old
maid
i
wanted
very
much
to
go
out
but
my
little
cousin
is
ill
and
i
can
not
leave
what
is
the
matter
with
her
i
don
t
know
she
had
to
go
to
gouraud
s
caution
not
to
say
his
distrust
was
constantly
excited
by
the
results
of
his
alliance
with
vinet
it
certainly
appeared
that
the
lawyer
had
got
the
lion
s
share
in
their
enterprise
vinet
controlled
the
paper
he
reigned
as
sole
master
over
it
he
took
the
revenues
whereas
the
colonel
the
responsible
editor
earned
little
vinet
and
cournant
had
done
the
rogrons
great
services
whereas
gouraud
a
colonel
on
could
do
nothing
who
was
to
be
deputy
vinet
who
was
the
chief
authority
in
the
party
vinet
whom
did
the
liberals
all
consult
vinet
moreover
the
colonel
knew
fully
as
well
as
vinet
himself
the
extent
and
depth
of
the
passion
suddenly
aroused
in
rogron
by
the
beautiful
bathilde
de
chargeboeuf
this
passion
had
now
become
intense
like
all
the
last
passions
of
men
bathilde
s
voice
made
him
tremble
absorbed
in
his
desires
rogron
hid
them
he
dared
not
hope
for
such
a
marriage
to
sound
him
the
colonel
mentioned
that
he
was
thinking
himself
of
asking
for
bathilde
s
hand
rogron
turned
pale
at
the
thought
of
such
a
formidable
rival
and
had
since
then
shown
coldness
and
even
hatred
to
gouraud
thus
vinet
reigned
supreme
in
the
rogron
household
while
he
the
colonel
had
no
hold
there
except
by
the
extremely
hypothetical
tie
of
his
mendacious
affection
for
sylvie
which
it
was
not
yet
clear
that
sylvie
reciprocated
when
the
lawyer
told
him
of
the
priest
s
manoeuvre
and
advised
him
to
break
with
sylvie
and
marry
pierrette
he
certainly
flattered
gouraud
s
foible
but
after
analyzing
the
inner
purpose
of
that
advice
and
examining
the
ground
all
about
him
the
colonel
thought
he
perceived
in
his
ally
the
intention
of
separating
him
from
sylvie
and
profiting
by
her
fears
to
throw
the
whole
rogron
property
into
the
hands
of
mademoiselle
de
chargeboeuf
therefore
when
the
colonel
was
left
alone
with
sylvie
his
perspicacity
possessed
itself
immediately
of
certain
signs
which
betrayed
her
uneasiness
he
saw
at
once
that
she
was
under
arms
and
had
made
this
plan
for
seeing
him
alone
as
he
already
suspected
vinet
of
playing
him
some
trick
he
attributed
the
conference
to
the
instigation
of
the
lawyer
and
was
instantly
on
his
guard
as
he
would
have
been
in
an
enemy
s
country
with
an
eye
all
about
him
an
ear
to
the
faintest
sound
his
mind
on
the
qui
vive
and
his
hand
on
a
weapon
the
colonel
had
the
defect
of
never
believing
a
single
word
said
to
him
by
a
woman
so
that
when
the
old
maid
brought
pierrette
on
the
scene
and
told
him
she
had
gone
to
bed
before
midday
he
concluded
that
sylvie
had
locked
her
up
by
way
of
punishment
and
out
of
jealousy
she
is
getting
to
be
quite
pretty
that
little
thing
he
said
with
an
easy
air
she
will
be
pretty
replied
mademoiselle
rogron
you
ought
to
send
her
to
paris
and
put
her
in
a
shop
continued
the
colonel
she
would
make
her
fortune
the
milliners
all
want
pretty
is
that
really
your
advice
asked
sylvie
in
a
troubled
voice
good
thought
the
colonel
i
was
right
vinet
advised
me
to
marry
pierrette
just
to
spoil
my
chance
with
the
old
harridan
but
he
said
aloud
what
else
can
you
do
with
her
there
s
that
beautiful
girl
bathilde
de
chargeboeuf
noble
and
reduced
to
nobody
will
have
her
pierrette
has
nothing
and
she
ll
never
marry
as
for
beauty
what
is
it
to
me
for
example
youth
and
beauty
are
nothing
for
haven
t
i
been
a
captain
of
cavalry
in
the
imperial
guard
and
carried
my
spurs
into
all
the
capitals
of
europe
and
known
all
the
handsomest
women
of
these
capitals
don
t
talk
to
me
i
tell
you
youth
and
beauty
are
devilishly
common
and
silly
at
he
went
on
adding
a
few
years
to
his
age
to
match
sylvie
s
after
surviving
the
retreat
from
moscow
and
going
through
that
terrible
campaign
of
france
a
man
is
broken
down
i
m
nothing
but
an
old
fellow
now
a
woman
like
you
would
pet
me
and
care
for
me
and
her
money
joined
to
my
poor
pension
would
give
me
ease
in
my
old
days
of
course
i
should
prefer
such
a
woman
to
a
little
minx
who
would
worry
the
life
out
of
me
and
be
thirty
years
old
with
passions
when
i
should
be
sixty
with
rheumatism
at
my
age
a
man
considers
and
calculates
to
tell
you
the
truth
between
ourselves
i
should
not
wish
to
have
sylvie
s
face
was
an
open
book
to
the
colonel
during
this
tirade
and
her
next
question
proved
to
him
vinet
s
perfidy
then
you
don
t
love
pierrette
she
said
heavens
are
you
out
of
your
mind
my
dear
sylvie
he
cried
can
those
who
have
no
teeth
crack
nuts
thank
god
i
ve
got
some
and
know
what
i
m
sylvie
thus
reassured
resolved
not
to
show
her
own
hand
and
thought
herself
very
shrewd
in
putting
her
own
ideas
into
her
brother
s
mouth
jerome
she
said
thought
of
the
how
could
your
brother
take
up
such
an
incongruous
idea
why
it
is
only
a
few
days
ago
that
in
order
to
find
out
his
secrets
i
told
him
i
loved
bathilde
he
turned
as
white
as
your
my
brother
does
he
love
bathilde
asked
sylvie
madly
and
yet
bathilde
is
only
after
his
one
for
you
vinet
thought
the
colonel
i
can
t
understand
why
he
should
have
told
you
that
about
pierrette
no
sylvie
he
said
taking
her
hand
and
pressing
it
in
a
certain
way
since
you
have
opened
this
matter
he
drew
nearer
to
her
well
he
kissed
her
hand
as
a
cavalry
captain
he
had
already
proved
his
courage
let
me
tell
you
that
i
desire
no
wife
but
you
though
such
a
marriage
may
look
like
one
of
convenience
i
feel
on
my
side
a
sincere
affection
for
but
if
i
you
to
marry
pierrette
if
i
leave
her
my
fortune
eh
colonel
but
i
don
t
want
to
be
miserable
in
my
home
and
in
less
than
ten
years
see
a
popinjay
like
julliard
hovering
round
my
wife
and
addressing
verses
to
her
in
the
newspapers
i
m
too
much
of
a
man
to
stand
that
no
i
will
never
make
a
marriage
that
is
disproportionate
in
well
colonel
we
will
talk
seriously
of
this
another
time
said
sylvie
casting
a
glance
upon
him
which
she
supposed
to
be
full
of
love
though
in
point
of
fact
it
was
a
good
deal
like
that
of
an
ogress
her
cold
blue
lips
of
a
violet
tinge
drew
back
from
the
yellow
teeth
and
she
thought
she
smiled
i
m
ready
said
rogron
coming
in
and
carrying
off
the
colonel
who
bowed
in
a
way
to
the
old
maid
gouraud
determined
to
press
on
his
marriage
with
sylvie
and
make
himself
master
of
the
house
resolving
to
rid
himself
through
his
influence
over
sylvie
during
the
honeymoon
of
bathilde
and
celeste
habert
so
during
their
walk
he
told
rogron
he
had
been
joking
the
other
day
that
he
had
no
real
intention
of
aspiring
to
bathilde
that
he
was
not
rich
enough
to
marry
a
woman
without
fortune
and
then
he
confided
to
him
his
real
wishes
declaring
that
he
had
long
chosen
sylvie
for
her
good
qualities
in
short
he
aspired
to
the
honor
of
being
rogron
s
ah
colonel
my
dear
baron
if
nothing
is
wanting
but
my
consent
you
have
it
with
no
further
delay
than
the
law
requires
cried
rogron
delighted
to
be
rid
of
his
formidable
rival
sylvie
spent
the
morning
in
her
own
room
considering
how
the
new
household
could
be
arranged
she
determined
to
build
a
second
storey
for
her
brother
and
to
furnish
the
rest
for
herself
and
her
husband
but
she
also
resolved
in
the
true
spirit
to
subject
the
colonel
to
certain
proofs
by
which
to
judge
of
his
heart
and
his
morals
before
she
finally
committed
herself
she
was
still
suspicious
and
wanted
to
make
sure
that
pierrette
had
no
private
intercourse
with
the
colonel
pierrette
came
down
before
the
to
lay
the
table
sylvie
had
been
forced
to
cook
the
dinner
and
had
sworn
at
that
cursed
pierrette
for
a
spot
she
had
made
on
her
gown
wasn
t
it
plain
that
if
pierrette
had
done
her
own
work
sylvie
wouldn
t
have
got
that
on
her
silk
dress
oh
here
you
are
you
are
like
the
dog
of
the
marshal
who
woke
up
as
soon
as
the
saucepans
rattled
ha
you
want
us
to
think
you
are
ill
you
little
liar
that
idea
you
did
not
tell
the
truth
about
what
happened
in
the
square
this
morning
therefore
you
lie
in
everything
was
a
hammer
with
which
sylvie
battered
the
head
and
also
the
heart
of
the
poor
girl
incessantly
to
pierrette
s
great
astonishment
sylvie
sent
her
to
dress
in
her
best
clothes
after
dinner
the
liveliest
imagination
is
never
up
to
the
level
of
the
activity
which
suspicion
excites
in
the
mind
of
an
old
maid
in
this
particular
case
this
particular
old
maid
carried
the
day
against
politicians
lawyers
notaries
and
all
other
sylvie
determined
to
consult
vinet
after
examining
herself
into
all
the
suspicious
circumstances
she
kept
pierrette
close
to
her
so
as
to
find
out
from
the
girl
s
face
whether
the
colonel
had
told
her
the
truth
on
this
particular
evening
the
chargeboeuf
ladies
were
the
first
to
arrive
bathilde
by
vinet
s
advice
had
become
more
elaborate
in
her
dress
she
now
wore
a
charming
gown
of
blue
velveteen
with
the
same
transparent
fichu
garnet
pendants
in
her
ears
her
hair
in
ringlets
the
wily
round
her
throat
black
satin
slippers
gray
silk
stockings
and
de
add
to
these
things
the
manners
of
a
queen
and
the
coquetry
of
a
young
girl
determined
to
capture
rogron
her
mother
calm
and
dignified
retained
as
did
her
daughter
a
certain
aristocratic
insolence
with
which
the
two
women
hedged
themselves
and
preserved
the
spirit
of
their
caste
bathilde
was
a
woman
of
intelligence
a
fact
which
vinet
alone
had
discovered
during
the
two
months
stay
the
ladies
had
made
at
his
house
when
he
had
fully
fathomed
the
mind
of
the
girl
wounded
and
disappointed
as
it
was
by
the
fruitlessness
of
her
beauty
and
her
youth
and
enlightened
by
the
contempt
she
felt
for
the
men
of
a
period
in
which
money
was
the
only
idol
vinet
himself
surprised
exclaimed
if
i
could
only
have
married
you
bathilde
i
should
be
keeper
of
the
seals
i
should
call
myself
vinet
de
chargeboeuf
and
take
my
seat
as
deputy
of
the
bathilde
had
no
vulgar
idea
in
her
marriage
intentions
she
did
not
marry
to
be
a
mother
nor
to
possess
a
husband
she
married
for
freedom
to
gain
a
responsible
position
to
be
called
madame
and
to
act
as
men
act
rogron
was
nothing
but
a
name
to
her
she
expected
to
make
something
of
the
fool
a
voting
deputy
for
instance
whose
instigator
she
would
be
moreover
she
longed
to
avenge
herself
on
her
family
who
had
taken
no
notice
of
a
girl
without
money
vinet
had
much
enlarged
and
strengthened
her
ideas
by
admiring
and
approving
them
my
dear
bathilde
he
said
while
explaining
to
her
the
influence
of
women
and
showing
her
the
sphere
of
action
in
which
she
ought
to
work
do
you
suppose
that
tiphaine
a
man
of
the
most
ordinary
capacity
could
ever
get
to
be
a
judge
of
the
royal
court
in
paris
by
himself
no
it
is
madame
tiphaine
who
has
got
him
elected
deputy
and
it
is
she
who
will
push
him
when
they
get
to
paris
her
mother
madame
roguin
is
a
shrewd
woman
who
does
what
she
likes
with
the
famous
banker
du
tillet
a
crony
of
nucingen
and
both
of
them
allies
of
the
kellers
the
administration
is
on
the
best
of
terms
with
those
lynxes
of
the
bank
there
is
no
reason
why
tiphaine
should
not
be
judge
through
his
wife
of
a
royal
court
marry
rogron
we
ll
have
him
elected
deputy
from
provins
as
soon
as
i
gain
another
precinct
in
the
you
can
then
get
him
a
place
as
where
he
ll
have
nothing
to
do
but
sign
his
name
we
shall
belong
to
the
opposition
the
liberals
triumph
but
if
the
bourbons
remain
ah
then
we
shall
lean
gently
gently
towards
the
centre
besides
you
must
remember
rogron
can
t
live
forever
and
then
you
can
marry
a
titled
man
in
short
put
yourself
in
a
good
position
and
the
chargeboeufs
will
be
ready
enough
to
serve
us
your
poverty
has
no
doubt
taught
you
as
mine
did
me
to
know
what
men
are
worth
we
must
make
use
of
them
as
we
do
of
a
man
or
a
woman

take
us
along

by
making

edition
of
catherine

he
left
his
wife
at
home
rejoiced
to
be
alone
with
her
two
children
while
he
went
every
night
to
the
rogrons
with
madame
and
mademoiselle
de

he
arrived
there
in
all
the
glory
of
better
circumstances
his
spectacles
were
of

his

a

black
trousers
thin
boots
a

a

up
his
apparel
in

of
the
former
vinet
pale
and
thin
snarling
and
gloomy
the
present
vinet
bore
himself
with
the
air
and
manner
of
a
man
of
importance
he
marched
boldly
forward
certain
of
success
with
that
peculiar
show
of
security
which
belongs
to
lawyers
who
know
the
hidden
places
of
the
law
his
sly
little
head
was
his
chin
which
gave
him
a
mincing
though
frigid
look
that
made
him
seem
agreeable
in
the
style
of
robespierre
certainly
he
would
make
a
fine
endowed
with
elastic
mischievous
and
even
murderous
eloquence
or
an
orator
of
the
shrewd
type
of
benjamin
constant
the
bitterness
and
the
hatred
which
formerly
actuated
him

now
turned
into

transformed
into

my
dear
how
are
you
said
madame
de
chargeboeuf
greeting
sylvie
bathilde
went
straight
to
the
fireplace
took
off
her
bonnet
looked
at
herself
in
the
glass
and
placed
her
pretty
foot
on
the
fender
that
rogron
might
admire
it
what
is
the
matter
with
you
she
said
to
him
looking
directly
in
his
face
you
have
not
bowed
to
me
pray
why
should
we
put
on
our
best
velvet
gowns
to
please
you
she
pushed
past
pierrette
to
lay
down
her
hat
which
the
latter
took
from
her
hand
and
which
she
let
her
take
exactly
as
though
she
were
a
servant
men
are
supposed
to
be
ferocious
and
tigers
too
but
neither
tigers
vipers
diplomatists
lawyers
executioners
or
kings
ever
approach
in
their
greatest
atrocities
the
gentle
cruelty
the
poisoned
sweetness
the
savage
disdain
of
one
young
woman
for
another
when
she
thinks
herself
superior
in
birth
or
fortune
or
grace
and
some
question
of
marriage
or
precedence
or
any
of
the
feminine
rivalries
is
raised
the
thank
you
mademoiselle
which
bathilde
said
to
pierrette
was
a
poem
in
many
strophes
she
was
named
bathilde
and
the
other
pierrette
she
was
a
chargeboeuf
the
other
a
lorrain
pierrette
was
small
and
weak
bathilde
was
tall
and
full
of
life
pierrette
was
living
on
charity
bathilde
and
her
mother
lived
on
their
means
pierrette
wore
a
stuff
gown
with
a
chemisette
bathilde
made
the
velvet
of
hers
undulate
bathilde
had
the
finest
shoulders
in
the
department
and
the
arm
of
a
queen
pierrette
s
were
skin
and
bone
pierrette
was
cinderella
bathilde
was
the
fairy
bathilde
was
about
to
marry
pierrette
was
to
die
a
maid
bathilde
was
adored
pierrette
was
loved
by
none
bathilde
s
hair
was
ravishingly
dressed
she
had
so
much
taste
pierrette
s
was
hidden
beneath
her
breton
cap
and
she
knew
nothing
of
the
fashions
moral
bathilde
was
everything
pierrette
nothing
the
proud
little
breton
girl
understood
this
tragic
poem
little
girl
said
madame
de
chargeboeuf
from
the
height
of
her
condescending
grandeur
and
in
the
tone
of
voice
which
her
pinched
nose
gave
her
vinet
put
the
last
touch
to
this
sort
of
insult
by
looking
fixedly
at
pierrette
and
saying
in
three
keys
oh
oh
oh
how
fine
we
are
pierrette
fine
said
the
poor
child
you
should
say
that
to
mademoiselle
de
chargeboeuf
not
to
oh
she
is
always
beautifully
dressed
replied
the
lawyer
isn
t
she
rogron
he
added
turning
to
the
master
of
the
house
and
grasping
his
hand
yes
said
rogron
why
do
you
force
him
to
say
what
he
does
not
think
said
bathilde
nothing
about
me
pleases
him
isn
t
that
true
she
added
going
up
to
rogron
and
standing
before
him
look
at
me
and
say
if
it
isn
t
rogron
looked
at
her
from
head
to
foot
and
gently
closed
his
eyes
like
a
cat
whose
head
is
being
scratched
you
are
too
beautiful
he
said
too
why
rogron
looked
at
the
fire
and
was
silent
just
then
mademoiselle
habert
entered
the
room
followed
by
the
colonel
celeste
habert
who
had
now
become
the
common
enemy
could
only
reckon
sylvie
on
her
side
nevertheless
everybody
present
showed
her
the
more
civility
and
amiable
attention
because
each
was
undermining
her
her
brother
though
no
longer
able
to
be
on
the
scene
of
action
was
well
aware
of
what
was
going
on
and
as
soon
as
he
perceived
that
his
sister
s
hopes
were
killed
he
became
an
implacable
and
terrible
antagonist
to
the
rogrons
every
one
will
immediately
picture
to
themselves
mademoiselle
habert
when
they
know
that
if
she
had
not
kept
an
institution
for
young
ladies
she
would
still
have
had
the
air
of
a
have
a
way
of
their
own
in
putting
on
their
caps
just
as
old
englishwomen
have
acquired
a
monopoly
in
turbans
have
a
monopoly
of
these
caps
flowers
nod
above
the
flowers
that
are
more
than
artificial
lying
by
in
closets
for
years
the
cap
is
both
new
and
old
even
on
the
day
it
is
first
worn
these
spinsters
make
it
a
point
of
honor
to
resemble
the
lay
figures
of
a
painter
they
sit
on
their
hips
never
on
their
chairs
when
any
one
speaks
to
them
they
turn
their
whole
busts
instead
of
simply
turning
their
heads
and
when
their
gowns
creak
one
is
tempted
to
believe
that
the
mechanism
of
these
beings
is
out
of
order
mademoiselle
habert
an
ideal
of
her
species
had
a
stern
eye
a
grim
mouth
and
beneath
her
wrinkled
chin
the
strings
of
her
cap
always
limp
and
faded
floated
as
she
moved
two
moles
rather
large
and
brown
adorned
that
chin
and
from
them
sprouted
hairs
which
she
allowed
to
grow
rampant
like
clematis
and
finally
to
complete
her
portrait
she
took
snuff
and
took
it
ungracefully
the
company
went
to
work
at
their
boston
mademoiselle
habert
sat
opposite
to
sylvie
with
the
colonel
at
her
side
opposite
to
madame
de
chargeboeuf
bathilde
was
near
her
mother
and
rogron
sylvie
placed
pierrette
between
herself
and
the
colonel
rogron
had
set
out
a
second
in
case
other
company
arrived
two
lamps
were
on
the
between
the
candelabra
and
the
clock
and
the
tables
were
lighted
by
candles
at
forty
sous
a
pound
paid
for
by
the
price
of
the
cards
come
pierrette
take
your
work
my
dear
said
sylvie
with
treacherous
softness
noticing
that
the
girl
was
watching
the
colonel
s
game
she
usually
affected
to
treat
pierrette
well
before
company
this
deception
irritated
the
honest
breton
girl
and
made
her
despise
her
cousin
she
took
her
embroidery
but
as
she
drew
her
stitches
she
still
watched
gouraud
s
play
gouraud
behaved
as
if
he
did
not
know
the
girl
was
near
him
sylvie
noticed
this
apparent
indifference
and
thought
it
extremely
suspicious
presently
she
undertook
a
in
hearts
the
pool
being
full
of
counters
besides
containing
sous
the
rest
of
the
company
had
now
arrived
among
them
the
desfondrilles
who
for
the
last
two
months
had
abandoned
the
tiphaine
party
and
connected
himself
more
or
less
with
the
vinets
he
was
standing
before
the
with
his
back
to
the
fire
and
the
tails
of
his
coat
over
his
arms
looking
round
the
fine
salon
of
which
mademoiselle
de
chargeboeuf
was
the
shining
ornament
for
it
really
seemed
as
if
all
the
reds
of
its
decoration
had
been
made
expressly
to
enhance
her
style
of
beauty
silence
reigned
pierrette
was
watching
the
game
sylvie
s
attention
was
distracted
from
her
by
the
interest
of
the
play
that
said
pierrette
to
the
colonel
pointing
to
a
heart
in
his
hand
the
colonel
began
a
sequence
in
hearts
the
hearts
all
lay
between
himself
and
sylvie
the
colonel
won
her
ace
though
it
was
protected
by
five
small
hearts
that
s
not
fair
she
cried
pierrette
saw
my
hand
and
the
colonel
took
her
but
mademoiselle
said
celeste
it
was
the
colonel
s
game
to
play
hearts
after
you
began
the
scene
made
monsieur
desfondrilles
smile
his
was
a
keen
mind
which
found
much
amusement
in
watching
the
play
of
all
the
in
provins
yes
it
was
certainly
the
colonel
s
game
said
cournant
the
notary
not
knowing
what
the
question
was
sylvie
threw
a
look
at
mademoiselle
habert
one
of
those
glances
which
pass
from
old
maid
to
old
maid
feline
and
cruel
pierrette
you
did
see
my
hand
said
sylvie
fixing
her
eyes
on
the
girl
no
i
was
looking
at
you
all
said
the
and
i
can
swear
that
pierrette
saw
no
one
s
hand
but
the
colonel
pooh
said
gouraud
alarmed
little
girls
know
how
to
slide
their
eyes
into
ah
exclaimed
sylvie
yes
continued
gouraud
i
dare
say
she
looked
into
your
hand
to
play
you
a
trick
didn
t
you
little
one
no
said
the
truthful
breton
i
wouldn
t
do
such
a
thing
if
i
had
it
would
have
been
in
my
cousin
s
you
know
you
are
a
and
a
little
fool
cried
sylvie
after
what
happened
this
morning
do
you
suppose
i
can
believe
a
word
you
say
you
are
a
pierrette
did
not
wait
for
sylvie
to
finish
her
sentence
foreseeing
a
torrent
of
insults
she
rushed
away
without
a
light
and
ran
to
her
room
sylvie
turned
white
with
anger
and
muttered
between
her
teeth
she
shall
pay
for
this
shall
you
pay
for
the
said
madame
de
chargeboeuf
as
she
spoke
pierrette
struck
her
head
against
the
door
of
the
passage
which
some
one
had
left
open
good
i
m
glad
of
it
cried
sylvie
as
they
heard
the
blow
she
must
be
hurt
said
desfondrilles
she
deserves
it
replied
sylvie
it
was
a
bad
blow
said
mademoiselle
habert
sylvie
thought
she
might
escape
paying
her
if
she
went
to
see
after
pierrette
but
madame
de
chargeboeuf
stopped
her
pay
us
first
she
said
laughing
you
will
forget
it
when
you
come
the
remark
based
on
the
old
maid
s
trickery
and
her
bad
faith
in
paying
her
debts
at
cards
was
approved
by
the
others
sylvie
sat
down
and
thought
no
more
of
pierrette
an
indifference
which
surprised
no
one
when
the
game
was
over
about
half
past
nine
o
clock
she
flung
herself
into
an
easy
chair
at
the
corner
of
the
fireplace
and
did
not
even
rise
as
her
guests
departed
the
colonel
was
torturing
her
she
did
not
know
what
to
think
of
him
men
are
so
false
she
cried
as
she
went
to
bed
pierrette
had
given
herself
a
frightful
blow
on
the
head
just
above
the
ear
at
the
spot
where
young
girls
part
their
hair
when
they
put
their
front
hair
in
curlpapers
the
next
day
there
was
a
large
swelling
god
has
punished
you
said
sylvie
at
the
breakfast
table
you
disobeyed
me
you
treated
me
with
disrespect
in
leaving
the
room
before
i
had
finished
my
sentence
you
got
what
you
nevertheless
said
rogron
she
ought
to
put
on
a
compress
of
salt
and
oh
it
is
nothing
at
all
cousin
said
pierrette
the
poor
child
had
reached
a
point
where
even
such
a
remark
seemed
to
her
a
proof
of
kindness
viii
the
loves
of
jacques
and
pierrette
the
week
ended
as
it
had
begun
in
continual
torture
sylvie
grew
ingenious
and
found
refinements
of
tyranny
with
almost
savage
cruelty
the
red
indians
might
have
taken
a
lesson
from
her
pierrette
dared
not
complain
of
her
vague
sufferings
nor
of
the
actual
pains
she
now
felt
in
her
head
the
origin
of
her
cousin
s
present
anger
was
the
of
brigaut
s
arrival
with
breton
obstinacy
pierrette
was
determined
to
keep
silence
a
resolution
that
is
perfectly
explicable
it
is
easy
to
see
how
her
thoughts
turned
to
brigaut
fearing
some
danger
for
him
if
he
were
discovered
yet
instinctively
longing
to
have
him
near
her
and
happy
in
knowing
he
was
in
provins
what
joy
to
have
seen
him
that
single
glimpse
was
like
the
look
an
exile
casts
upon
his
country
or
the
martyr
lifts
to
heaven
where
his
eyes
gifted
with
can
enter
while
flames
consume
his
body
pierrette
s
glance
had
been
so
thoroughly
understood
by
the
major
s
son
that
as
he
planed
his
planks
or
took
his
measures
or
joined
his
wood
he
was
working
his
brains
to
find
out
some
way
of
communicating
with
her
he
ended
by
choosing
the
simplest
of
all
schemes
at
a
certain
hour
of
the
night
pierrette
must
lower
a
letter
by
a
string
from
her
window
in
the
midst
of
the
girl
s
own
sufferings
she
too
was
sustained
by
the
hope
of
being
able
to
communicate
with
brigaut
the
same
desire
was
in
both
hearts
parted
they
understood
each
other
at
every
shock
to
her
heart
every
throb
of
pain
in
her
head
pierrette
said
to
herself
brigaut
is
here
and
that
thought
enabled
her
to
live
without
complaint
one
morning
in
the
market
brigaut
lying
in
wait
was
able
to
get
near
her
though
he
saw
her
tremble
and
turn
pale
like
an
autumn
leaf
about
to
flutter
down
he
did
not
lose
his
head
but
quietly
bought
fruit
of
the
with
whom
sylvie
was
bargaining
he
found
his
chance
of
slipping
a
note
to
pierrette
all
the
while
joking
the
woman
with
the
ease
of
a
man
accustomed
to
such
manoeuvres
so
cool
was
he
in
action
though
the
blood
hummed
in
his
ears
and
rushed
boiling
through
his
veins
and
arteries
he
had
the
firmness
of
a
without
and
the
shrinkings
of
innocence
within
him
like
certain
mothers
in
their
moments
of
mortal
trial
when
held
between
two
dangers
two
catastrophes
pierrette
s
inward
commotion
was
like
brigaut
s
she
slipped
the
note
into
the
pocket
of
her
apron
the
hectic
spots
upon
her
cheekbones
turned
to
a
these
two
children
went
through
all
unknown
to
themselves
many
more
emotions
than
go
to
the
of
a
dozen
ordinary
loves
this
moment
in
the
left
in
their
souls
a
of
passionate
feeling
sylvie
who
did
not
recognize
the
breton
accent
took
no
notice
of
brigaut
and
pierrette
went
home
safely
with
her
treasure
the
letters
of
these
two
poor
children
were
fated
to
serve
as
documents
in
a
terrible
judicial
inquiry
otherwise
without
the
fatal
circumstances
that
occasioned
that
inquiry
they
would
never
have
been
heard
of
here
is
the
one
which
pierrette
read
that
night
in
her
chamber
my
dear
pierrette
at
midnight
when
everybody
is
asleep
but
me
who
am
watching
you
i
will
come
every
night
under
your
window
let
down
a
string
long
enough
to
reach
me
it
will
not
make
any
noise
you
must
fasten
to
the
end
of
it
whatever
you
write
to
me
i
will
tie
my
letter
in
the
same
way
i
hear
have
taught
you
to
read
and
write
those
wicked
relations
who
were
to
do
you
good
and
have
done
you
so
much
harm
you
pierrette
the
daughter
of
a
colonel
who
died
for
france
reduced
by
those
monsters
to
be
their
servant
that
is
where
all
your
pretty
color
and
health
have
gone
my
pierrette
what
has
become
of
her
what
have
they
done
with
her
i
see
plainly
you
are
not
the
same
not
happy
oh
pierrette
let
us
go
back
to
brittany
i
can
earn
enough
now
to
give
you
what
you
need
for
you
yourself
can
earn
three
francs
a
day
and
i
can
earn
four
or
five
and
thirty
sous
is
all
i
want
to
live
on
ah
pierrette
how
i
have
prayed
the
good
god
for
you
ever
since
i
came
here
i
have
asked
him
to
give
me
all
your
sufferings
and
you
all
pleasures
why
do
you
stay
with
them
why
do
they
keep
you
your
grandmother
is
more
to
you
than
they
they
are
vipers
they
have
taken
your
gaiety
away
from
you
you
do
not
even
walk
as
you
once
did
in
brittany
let
us
go
back
i
am
here
to
serve
you
to
do
your
will
tell
me
what
you
wish
if
you
need
money
i
have
a
hundred
and
fifty
francs
i
can
send
them
up
by
the
string
though
i
would
like
to
kiss
your
dear
hands
and
lay
the
money
in
them
ah
dear
pierrette
it
is
a
long
time
now
that
the
blue
sky
has
been
overcast
for
me
i
have
not
had
two
hours
happiness
since
i
put
you
into
that
diligence
of
evil
and
when
i
saw
you
the
other
morning
looking
like
a
shadow
i
could
not
reach
you
that
hag
of
a
cousin
came
between
us
but
at
least
we
can
have
the
consolation
of
praying
to
god
together
every
sunday
in
church
perhaps
he
will
hear
us
all
the
more
when
we
pray
together
not
my
dear
pierrette
but
this
letter
so
affected
pierrette
that
she
sat
for
more
than
an
hour
reading
and
and
gazing
at
it
then
she
remembered
with
anguish
that
she
had
nothing
to
write
with
she
summoned
courage
to
make
the
difficult
journey
from
her
garret
to
the
where
she
obtained
pen
paper
and
ink
and
returned
safely
without
waking
her
terrible
cousin
a
few
minutes
before
midnight
she
had
finished
the
following
letter
my
friend
oh
yes
my
friend
for
there
is
no
one
but
you
jacques
and
my
grandmother
to
love
me
god
forgive
me
but
you
are
the
only
two
persons
whom
i
love
both
alike
neither
more
nor
less
i
was
too
little
to
know
my
dear
mamma
but
you
jacques
and
my
grandmother
and
my
grandfather
god
grant
him
heaven
for
he
suffered
much
from
his
ruin
which
was
mine
but
you
two
who
are
left
i
love
you
both
unhappy
as
i
am
indeed
to
know
how
much
i
love
you
you
will
have
to
know
how
much
i
suffer
but
i
don
t
wish
that
it
would
grieve
you
too
much
speak
to
me
as
we
would
not
speak
to
a
dog
treat
me
like
the
worst
of
girls
and
yet
i
do
examine
myself
before
god
and
i
can
not
find
that
i
do
wrong
by
them
before
you
sang
to
me
the
marriage
song
i
saw
the
mercy
of
god
in
my
sufferings
for
i
had
prayed
to
him
to
take
me
from
the
world
and
i
felt
so
ill
i
said
to
myself
god
hears
me
but
jacques
now
you
are
here
i
want
to
live
and
go
back
to
brittany
to
my
grandmamma
who
loves
me
though
say
she
stole
eight
thousand
francs
of
mine
jacques
is
that
so
if
they
are
mine
could
you
get
them
but
it
is
not
true
for
if
my
grandmother
had
eight
thousand
francs
she
would
not
live
at
i
don
t
want
to
trouble
her
last
days
my
kind
good
grandmamma
with
the
knowledge
of
my
troubles
she
might
die
of
it
ah
if
she
knew
they
made
her
grandchild
scrub
the
pots
and
pans
she
who
used
to
say
to
me
when
i
wanted
to
help
her
after
her
troubles
don
t
touch
that
my
darling
leave
it
leave
it
you
will
spoil
your
pretty
ah
my
hands
are
never
clean
now
sometimes
i
can
hardly
carry
the
basket
home
from
market
it
cuts
my
arm
still
i
don
t
think
my
cousins
mean
to
be
cruel
but
it
is
their
way
always
to
scold
and
it
seems
that
i
have
no
right
to
leave
them
my
cousin
rogron
is
my
guardian
one
day
when
i
wanted
to
run
away
because
i
could
not
bear
it
and
told
them
so
my
cousin
sylvie
said
the
gendarmes
would
go
after
me
for
the
law
was
my
master
oh
i
know
now
that
cousins
can
not
take
the
place
of
father
or
mother
any
more
than
the
saints
can
take
the
place
of
god
my
poor
jacques
what
do
you
suppose
i
could
do
with
your
money
keep
it
for
our
journey
oh
how
i
think
of
you
and
and
the
big
pong
that
s
where
we
had
our
only
happy
days
i
shall
have
no
more
for
i
feel
i
am
going
from
bad
to
worse
i
am
very
ill
jacques
i
have
dreadful
pains
in
my
head
and
in
my
bones
and
back
which
kill
me
and
i
have
no
appetite
except
for
horrid
things
roots
and
leaves
and
such
things
sometimes
i
cry
when
i
am
all
alone
for
they
won
t
let
me
do
anything
i
like
if
they
know
it
not
even
cry
i
have
to
hide
to
offer
my
tears
to
him
to
whom
we
owe
the
mercies
which
we
call
afflictions
it
must
have
been
he
who
gave
you
the
blessed
thought
to
come
and
sing
the
marriage
song
beneath
my
window
ah
jacques
my
cousin
heard
you
and
she
said
i
had
a
lover
if
you
wish
to
be
my
lover
love
me
well
i
promise
to
love
you
always
as
i
did
in
the
past
and
to
be
your
faithful
servant
pierrette
lorrain
you
will
love
me
always
won
t
you
she
had
brought
a
crust
of
bread
from
the
kitchen
in
which
she
now
made
a
hole
for
the
letter
and
fastened
it
like
a
weight
to
her
string
at
midnight
having
opened
her
window
with
extreme
caution
she
lowered
the
letter
with
the
crust
which
made
no
noise
against
either
the
wall
of
the
house
or
the
blinds
presently
she
felt
the
string
pulled
by
brigaut
who
broke
it
and
then
crept
softly
away
when
he
reached
the
middle
of
the
square
she
could
see
him
indistinctly
by
the
starlight
but
he
saw
her
quite
clearly
in
the
zone
of
light
thrown
by
the
candle
the
two
children
stood
thus
for
over
an
hour
pierrette
making
him
signs
to
go
he
starting
she
remaining
he
coming
back
to
his
post
and
pierrette
again
signing
that
he
must
leave
her
this
was
repeated
till
the
child
closed
her
window
went
to
bed
and
blew
out
the
candle
once
in
bed
she
fell
asleep
happy
in
heart
though
suffering
in
body
she
had
brigaut
s
letter
under
her
pillow
she
slept
as
the
persecuted
sleep
a
slumber
bright
with
angels
that
slumber
full
of
heavenly
arabesques
in
atmospheres
of
gold
and
perceived
and
given
to
us
by
raffaelle
the
moral
nature
had
such
empire
over
that
frail
physical
nature
that
on
the
morrow
pierrette
rose
light
and
joyous
as
a
lark
as
radiant
and
as
gay
such
a
change
could
not
escape
the
vigilant
eye
of
her
cousin
sylvie
who
this
time
instead
of
scolding
her
set
about
watching
her
with
the
scrutiny
of
a
magpie
what
reason
is
there
for
such
happiness
was
a
thought
of
jealousy
not
of
tyranny
if
the
colonel
had
not
been
in
sylvie
s
mind
she
would
have
said
to
pierrette
as
formerly
pierrette
you
are
very
noise
and
very
regardless
of
what
you
have
often
been
but
now
the
old
maid
resolved
to
spy
upon
her
as
only
old
maids
can
spy
the
day
was
still
and
gloomy
like
the
weather
that
precedes
a
storm
you
don
t
appear
to
be
ill
now
mademoiselle
said
sylvie
at
dinner
didn
t
i
tell
you
she
put
it
all
on
to
annoy
us
she
cried
addressing
her
brother
and
not
waiting
for
pierrette
s
answer
on
the
contrary
cousin
i
have
a
sort
of
fever
fever
what
fever
you
are
as
gay
as
a
lark
perhaps
you
have
seen
some
one
again
pierrette
trembled
and
dropped
her
eyes
on
her
plate
tartufe
cried
sylvie
and
only
fourteen
years
old
what
a
nature
do
you
mean
to
come
to
a
bad
end
i
don
t
know
what
you
mean
said
pierrette
raising
her
sweet
and
luminous
brown
eyes
to
her
cousin
this
evening
said
sylvie
you
are
to
stay
in
the
with
a
candle
and
do
your
sewing
you
are
not
wanted
in
the
salon
i
sha
n
t
have
you
looking
into
my
hand
to
help
your
pierrette
made
no
sign
artful
creature
cried
sylvie
leaving
the
room
rogron
who
did
not
understand
his
sister
s
anger
said
to
pierrette
what
is
all
this
about
try
to
please
your
cousin
pierrette
she
is
very
indulgent
to
you
very
gentle
and
if
you
put
her
out
of
temper
the
fault
is
certainly
yours
why
do
you
squabble
so
for
my
part
i
like
to
live
in
peace
look
at
mademoiselle
bathilde
and
take
pattern
by
pierrette
felt
able
to
bear
everything
brigaut
would
come
at
midnight
and
bring
her
an
answer
and
that
hope
was
the
viaticum
of
her
day
but
she
was
using
up
her
last
strength
she
did
not
go
to
bed
and
stood
waiting
for
the
hour
to
strike
at
last
midnight
sounded
softly
she
opened
the
window
this
time
she
used
a
string
made
by
tying
bits
of
twine
together
she
heard
brigaut
s
step
and
on
drawing
up
the
cord
she
found
the
following
letter
which
filled
her
with
joy
my
dear
pierrette
as
you
are
so
ill
you
must
not
tire
yourself
by
waiting
for
me
you
will
hear
me
if
i
cry
like
an
owl
happily
my
father
taught
me
to
imitate
their
note
so
when
you
hear
the
cry
three
times
you
will
know
i
am
there
and
then
you
must
let
down
the
cord
but
i
shall
not
come
again
for
some
days
i
hope
then
to
bring
you
good
news
oh
pierrette
don
t
talk
of
dying
pierrette
don
t
think
such
things
all
my
heart
shook
i
felt
as
though
i
were
dead
myself
at
the
mere
idea
no
my
pierrette
you
must
not
die
you
will
live
happy
and
soon
you
shall
be
delivered
from
your
persecutors
if
i
do
not
succeed
in
what
i
am
undertaking
for
your
rescue
i
shall
appeal
to
the
law
and
i
shall
speak
out
before
heaven
and
earth
and
tell
how
your
wicked
relations
are
treating
you
i
am
certain
that
you
have
not
many
more
days
to
suffer
have
patience
my
pierrette
jacques
is
watching
over
you
as
in
the
old
days
when
we
slid
on
the
pond
and
i
pulled
you
out
of
the
hole
in
which
we
were
nearly
drowned
together
adieu
my
dear
pierrette
in
a
few
days
if
god
wills
we
shall
be
happy
alas
i
dare
not
tell
you
the
only
thing
that
may
hinder
our
meeting
but
god
loves
us
in
a
few
days
i
shall
see
my
dear
pierrette
at
liberty
without
troubles
without
any
one
to
hinder
my
looking
at
you
for
ah
pierrette
i
hunger
to
see
you
pierrette
pierrette
who
deigns
to
love
me
and
to
tell
me
so
yes
pierrette
i
will
be
your
lover
when
i
have
earned
the
fortune
you
deserve
till
then
i
will
be
to
you
only
a
devoted
servant
whose
life
is
yours
to
do
what
you
please
with
it
adieu
jacques
brigaut
here
is
a
letter
of
which
the
major
s
son
said
nothing
to
pierrette
he
wrote
it
to
madame
lorrain
at
nantes
madame
lorrain
your
granddaughter
will
die
with
if
you
do
not
come
to
fetch
her
i
could
scarcely
recognize
her
and
to
show
you
the
state
of
things
i
enclose
a
letter
i
have
received
from
pierrette
you
are
thought
here
to
have
taken
the
money
of
your
granddaughter
and
you
ought
to
justify
yourself
if
you
can
come
at
once
we
may
still
be
happy
but
if
delay
pierrette
will
be
dead
i
am
with
respect
your
devoted
servant
jacques
brigaut
at
monsieur
frappier
s
grand
rue
provins
brigaut
s
fear
was
that
the
grandmother
was
dead
though
this
letter
of
the
youth
whom
in
her
innocence
she
called
her
lover
was
almost
enigmatical
to
pierrette
she
believed
in
it
with
all
her
virgin
faith
her
heart
was
filled
with
that
sensation
which
travellers
in
the
desert
feel
when
they
see
from
afar
the
round
a
well
in
a
few
days
her
misery
would
end
jacques
said
so
she
relied
on
this
promise
of
her
childhood
s
friend
and
yet
as
she
laid
the
letter
beside
the
other
a
dreadful
thought
came
to
her
in
foreboding
words
poor
jacques
she
said
to
herself
he
does
not
know
the
hole
into
which
i
have
now
fallen
sylvie
had
heard
pierrette
and
she
had
also
heard
brigaut
under
her
window
she
jumped
out
of
bed
and
rushed
to
the
window
to
look
through
the
blinds
into
the
square
and
there
she
saw
in
the
moonlight
a
man
hurrying
in
the
direction
of
the
colonel
s
house
in
front
of
which
brigaut
happened
to
stop
the
old
maid
gently
opened
her
door
went
upstairs
was
amazed
to
find
a
light
in
pierrette
s
room
looked
through
the
keyhole
and
could
see
nothing
pierrette
she
said
are
you
ill
no
cousin
said
pierrette
surprised
why
is
your
candle
burning
at
this
time
of
night
open
the
door
i
must
know
what
this
pierrette
went
to
the
door
and
as
soon
as
sylvie
entered
the
room
she
saw
the
cord
which
pierrette
had
forgotten
to
put
away
not
dreaming
of
a
surprise
sylvie
jumped
upon
it
what
is
that
for
she
asked
nothing
nothing
she
cried
always
lying
you
ll
never
get
to
heaven
that
way
go
to
bed
you
ll
take
she
asked
no
more
questions
and
went
away
leaving
pierrette
terrified
by
her
unusual
clemency
instead
of
exploding
with
rage
sylvie
had
suddenly
determined
to
surprise
pierrette
and
the
colonel
together
to
seize
their
letters
and
confound
the
two
lovers
who
were
deceiving
her
pierrette
inspired
by
a
sense
of
danger
sewed
the
letters
into
her
corset
and
covered
them
with
calico
here
end
the
loves
of
pierrette
and
brigaut
pierrette
rejoiced
in
the
thought
that
jacques
had
determined
to
hold
no
communication
with
her
for
some
days
because
her
cousin
s
suspicions
would
be
quieted
by
finding
nothing
to
feed
them
sylvie
did
in
fact
spend
the
next
three
nights
on
her
legs
and
each
evening
in
watching
the
innocent
colonel
without
discovering
either
in
him
or
in
pierrette
or
in
the
house
or
out
of
it
anything
that
betrayed
their
understanding
she
sent
pierrette
to
confession
and
seized
that
moment
to
search
the
child
s
room
with
the
method
and
penetration
of
a
spy
or
a
officer
she
found
nothing
her
fury
reached
the
apogee
of
human
sentiments
if
pierrette
had
been
there
she
would
certainly
have
struck
her
remorselessly
to
a
woman
of
her
temper
jealousy
was
less
a
sentiment
than
an
occupation
she
existed
in
it
it
made
her
heart
beat
she
felt
emotions
hitherto
completely
unknown
to
her
the
slightest
sound
or
movement
kept
her
on
the
qui
vive
she
watched
pierrette
with
gloomy
intentness
that
miserable
little
wretch
will
kill
me
she
said
sylvie
s
severity
to
her
cousin
reached
the
point
of
refined
cruelty
and
made
the
deplorable
condition
of
the
poor
girl
worse
daily
she
had
fever
regularly
and
the
pains
in
her
head
became
intolerable
by
the
end
of
the
week
even
the
visitors
at
the
house
noticed
her
suffering
face
which
would
have
touched
to
pity
all
selfishness
less
cruel
than
theirs
it
happened
that
doctor
neraud
possibly
by
vinet
s
advice
did
not
come
to
the
house
during
that
week
the
colonel
knowing
himself
suspected
by
sylvie
was
afraid
to
risk
his
marriage
by
showing
any
solicitude
for
pierrette
bathilde
explained
the
visible
change
in
the
girl
by
her
natural
growth
but
at
last
one
sunday
evening
when
pierrette
was
in
the
salon
her
sufferings
overcame
her
and
she
fainted
away
the
colonel
who
first
saw
her
going
caught
her
in
his
arms
and
carried
her
to
a
sofa
she
did
it
on
purpose
said
sylvie
looking
at
mademoiselle
habert
and
the
rest
who
were
playing
boston
with
her
i
assure
you
that
your
cousin
is
very
ill
said
the
colonel
she
seemed
well
enough
in
your
arms
sylvie
said
to
him
in
a
low
voice
with
a
savage
smile
the
colonel
is
right
said
madame
de
chargeboeuf
you
ought
to
send
for
a
doctor
this
morning
at
church
every
one
was
speaking
as
they
came
out
of
mademoiselle
lorrain
s
i
am
dying
said
pierrette
desfondrilles
called
to
sylvie
and
told
her
to
unfasten
her
cousin
s
gown
sylvie
went
up
to
the
girl
saying
it
is
only
a
she
unfastened
the
gown
and
was
about
to
touch
the
corset
when
pierrette
roused
by
the
danger
sat
up
with
superhuman
strength
exclaiming
no
no
i
will
go
to
sylvie
had
however
touched
the
corset
and
felt
the
papers
she
let
pierrette
go
saying
to
the
company
what
do
you
think
now
of
her
illness
i
tell
you
it
is
all
a
pretence
you
have
no
idea
of
the
perversity
of
that
after
the
was
over
she
kept
vinet
from
following
the
other
guests
she
was
furious
and
wanted
vengeance
and
was
grossly
rude
to
the
colonel
when
he
bade
her
gouraud
threw
a
look
at
the
lawyer
which
threatened
him
to
the
depths
of
his
being
and
seemed
to
put
a
ball
in
his
entrails
sylvie
told
vinet
to
remain
when
they
were
alone
she
said
never
in
my
life
never
in
my
born
days
will
i
marry
the
now
that
you
have
come
to
that
decision
i
may
speak
said
the
lawyer
the
colonel
is
my
friend
but
i
am
more
yours

vinet
departed
having
put
his
plan
into
sylvie
s
head
her
dogged
obstinacy

to
him
the
old
maid
he
was
certain
would
think
the
scheme
her
own
and
carry
it
out

lawyer

the
colonel
in
the
square
smoking
a
cigar
while
he
waited

defending

accused
and
convicted
of
writing
to
pierrette
she
saw
you
leave
your
house
at
midnight
and
come
to
the
girl

window
stuff
and
nonsense

and
you

pulled
the
blankets
all
over
to
your
side

shall
see
said
vinet
grasping
the
colonel
s
hand
affectionately
about
one
o
clock
that
night
three
clear
sharp
cries
of
an
owl
wonderfully
well
imitated
echoed
through
the
square
pierrette
heard
them
in
her
feverish
sleep
she
jumped
up
moist
with
perspiration
opened
her
window
saw
brigaut
and
flung
down
a
ball
of
silk
to
which
he
fastened
a
letter
sylvie
agitated
by
the
events
of
the
day
and
her
own
indecision
of
mind
was
not
asleep
she
heard
the
owl
ah
bird
of
she
thought
why
pierrette
is
getting
up
what
is
she
after
hearing
the
attic
window
open
softly
sylvie
rushed
to
her
own
window
and
heard
the
rustle
of
paper
against
her
blinds
she
fastened
the
strings
of
her
and
went
quickly
upstairs
to
pierrette
s
room
where
she
found
the
poor
girl
unwinding
the
silk
and
freeing
the
letter
ha
i
ve
caught
you
cried
the
old
woman
rushing
to
the
window
from
which
she
saw
jacques
running
at
full
speed
give
me
that
no
cousin
said
pierrette
who
by
one
of
those
strong
inspirations
of
youth
sustained
by
her
own
soul
rose
to
a
grandeur
of
resistance
such
as
we
admire
in
the
history
of
certain
peoples
reduced
to
despair
ha
you
will
not
cried
sylvie
advancing
upon
the
girl
with
a
face
full
of
hatred
and
fury
pierrette
fell
back
to
get
time
to
put
her
letter
in
her
hand
which
she
clenched
with
unnatural
force
seeing
this
manoeuvre
sylvie
grasped
the
delicate
white
hand
of
the
girl
in
her
lobster
claws
and
tried
to
open
it
it
was
a
frightful
struggle
an
infamous
struggle
it
was
more
than
a
physical
struggle
it
assailed
the
mind
the
sole
treasure
of
the
human
being
the
thought
which
god
has
placed
beyond
all
earthly
power
and
guards
as
the
secret
way
between
the
sufferer
and
himself
the
two
women
one
dying
the
other
in
the
vigor
of
health
looked
at
each
other
fixedly
pierrette
s
eyes
darted
on
her
executioner
the
look
the
famous
templar
on
the
rack
cast
upon
philippe
le
bel
who
could
not
bear
it
and
fled
thunderstricken
sylvie
a
woman
and
a
jealous
woman
answered
that
magnetic
look
with
malignant
flashes
a
dreadful
silence
reigned
the
clenched
hand
of
the
breton
girl
resisted
her
cousin
s
efforts
like
a
block
of
steel
sylvie
twisted
pierrette
s
arm
she
tried
to
force
the
fingers
open
unable
to
do
so
she
stuck
her
nails
into
the
flesh
at
last
in
her
madness
she
set
her
teeth
into
the
wrist
trying
to
conquer
the
girl
by
pain
pierrette
defied
her
still
with
that
same
terrible
glance
of
innocence
the
anger
of
the
old
maid
grew
to
such
a
pitch
that
it
became
blind
fury
she
seized
pierrette
s
arm
and
struck
the
closed
fist
upon
the
and
then
upon
the
marble
of
the
mantelpiece
as
we
crack
a
nut
to
get
the
kernel
help
help
cried
pierrette
they
are
murdering
me
ha
you
may
well
scream
when
i
catch
you
with
a
lover
in
the
dead
of
and
she
beat
the
hand
pitilessly
help
help
cried
pierrette
the
blood
flowing
at
that
instant
loud
knocks
were
heard
at
the
front
door
exhausted
the
two
women
paused
a
moment
rogron
awakened
and
uneasy
not
knowing
what
was
happening
had
got
up
gone
to
his
sister
s
room
and
not
finding
her
was
frightened
hearing
the
knocks
he
went
down
unfastened
the
front
door
and
was
nearly
knocked
over
by
brigaut
followed
by
a
sort
of
phantom
at
this
moment
sylvie
s
eyes
chanced
to
fall
on
pierrette
s
corset
and
she
remembered
the
papers
releasing
the
girl
s
wrist
she
sprang
upon
the
corset
like
a
tiger
on
its
prey
and
showed
it
to
pierrette
with
a
smile
the
smile
of
an
iroquois
over
his
victim
before
he
scalps
him
i
am
dying
said
pierrette
falling
on
her
knees
oh
who
will
save
me
i
said
a
woman
with
white
hair
and
an
aged
parchment
face
in
which
two
gray
eyes
glittered
ah
grandmother
you
have
come
too
late
cried
the
poor
child
bursting
into
tears
pierrette
fell
upon
her
bed
her
strength
all
gone
with
the
exhaustion
which
in
her
feeble
state
followed
so
violent
a
struggle
the
tall
gray
woman
took
her
in
her
arms
as
a
nurse
lifts
a
child
and
went
out
followed
by
brigaut
without
a
word
to
sylvie
on
whom
she
cast
one
glance
of
majestic
accusation
the
apparition
of
that
august
old
woman
in
her
breton
costume
shrouded
in
her
coif
a
sort
of
hooded
mantle
of
black
cloth
accompanied
by
brigaut
appalled
sylvie
she
fancied
she
saw
death
she
slowly
went
down
the
stairs
listened
to
the
front
door
closing
behind
them
and
came
face
to
face
with
her
brother
who
exclaimed
then
they
haven
t
killed
you
go
to
bed
said
sylvie
we
will
see
what
we
must
she
went
back
to
her
own
bed
ripped
open
the
corset
and
read
brigaut
s
two
letters
which
confounded
her
she
went
to
sleep
in
the
greatest
perplexity
not
imagining
the
terrible
results
to
which
her
conduct
was
to
lead
the
letters
sent
by
brigaut
to
old
madame
lorrain
reached
her
in
a
moment
of
ineffable
joy
which
the
perusal
of
them
troubled
the
poor
old
woman
had
grieved
deeply
in
living
without
her
pierrette
beside
her
but
she
had
consoled
her
loneliness
with
the
thought
that
the
sacrifice
of
herself
was
in
the
interests
of
her
grandchild
she
was
blessed
with
one
of
those
hearts
which
are
upheld
and
invigorated
by
the
idea
of
sacrifice
her
old
husband
whose
only
joy
was
his
little
granddaughter
had
grieved
for
pierrette
every
day
he
had
seemed
to
look
for
her
it
was
an
old
man
s
grief
on
which
such
old
men
live
of
which
they
die
every
one
can
now
imagine
the
happiness
which
this
poor
old
woman
living
in
a
sort
of
almshouse
felt
when
she
learned
of
a
generous
action
rare
indeed
but
not
impossible
in
france
the
head
of
the
house
of
collinet
whose
failure
in
had
caused
the
lorrains
a
loss
of
thousand
francs
had
gone
to
america
with
his
children
after
his
disasters
he
had
too
high
a
courage
to
remain
a
ruined
man
after
eleven
years
of
untold
effort
crowned
by
success
he
returned
to
nantes
to
recover
his
position
leaving
his
eldest
son
in
charge
of
his
transatlantic
house
he
found
madame
lorrain
of
in
the
institution
of
and
was
witness
of
the
resignation
with
which
this
most
unfortunate
of
his
creditors
bore
her
misery
god
forgive
you
said
the
old
woman
since
you
give
me
on
the
borders
of
my
grave
the
means
of
securing
the
happiness
of
my
dear
granddaughter
but
alas
it
will
not
clear
the
debts
of
my
poor
husband
monsieur
collinet
made
over
to
the
widow
both
the
capital
and
the
accrued
interest
amounting
to
about
thousand
francs
his
other
creditors
prosperous
rich
and
intelligent
merchants
had
easily
born
their
losses
whereas
the
misfortunes
of
the
lorrains
seemed
so
irremediable
to
old
monsieur
collinet
that
he
promised
the
widow
to
pay
off
her
husband
s
debts
to
the
amount
of
forty
thousand
francs
more
when
the
bourse
of
nantes
heard
of
this
generous
reparation
they
wished
to
receive
collinet
to
their
board
before
his
certificates
were
granted
by
the
royal
court
at
rennes
but
the
merchant
refused
the
honor
preferring
to
submit
to
the
ordinary
commercial
rule
madame
lorrain
had
received
the
money
only
the
day
before
the
post
brought
her
brigaut
s
letter
enclosing
that
of
pierrette
her
first
thought
had
been
as
she
signed
the
receipt
now
i
can
live
with
my
pierrette
and
marry
her
to
that
good
brigaut
who
will
make
a
fortune
with
my
therefore
the
moment
she
had
read
the
fatal
letters
she
made
instant
preparations
to
start
for
provins
she
left
nantes
that
night
by
the
mail
for
some
one
had
explained
to
her
its
celerity
in
paris
she
took
the
diligence
for
troyes
which
passes
through
provins
and
by
eleven
at
night
she
reached
frappier
s
where
brigaut
shocked
at
her
despairing
looks
told
her
of
pierrette
s
state
and
promised
to
bring
the
poor
girl
to
her
instantly
his
words
so
terrified
the
grandmother
that
she
could
not
control
her
impatience
and
followed
him
to
the
square
when
pierrette
screamed
the
horror
of
that
cry
went
to
her
heart
as
sharply
as
it
did
to
brigaut
s
together
they
would
have
roused
the
neighborhood
if
rogron
in
his
terror
had
not
opened
the
door
the
scream
of
the
young
girl
at
bay
gave
her
grandmother
the
sudden
strength
of
anger
with
which
she
carried
her
dear
pierrette
in
her
arms
to
frappier
s
house
where
madame
frappier
hastily
arranged
brigaut
s
own
room
for
the
old
woman
and
her
treasure
in
that
poor
room
on
a
bed
the
sufferer
was
deposited
and
there
she
fainted
away
holding
her
hand
still
clenched
wounded
bleeding
with
the
nails
deep
bedded
in
the
flesh
brigaut
frappier
his
wife
and
the
old
woman
stood
looking
at
pierrette
in
silence
all
four
of
them
in
a
state
of
indescribable
amazement
why
is
her
hand
bloody
said
the
grandmother
at
last
pierrette
overcome
by
the
sleep
which
follows
all
abnormal
displays
of
strength
and
dimly
conscious
that
she
was
safe
from
violence
gradually
unbent
her
fingers
brigaut
s
letter
fell
from
them
like
an
answer
they
tried
to
take
my
letter
from
her
said
brigaut
falling
on
his
knees
and
picking
up
the
lines
in
which
he
had
told
his
little
friend
to
come
instantly
and
softly
away
from
the
house
he
kissed
with
pious
love
the
martyr
s
hand
it
was
a
sight
that
made
those
present
tremble
when
they
saw
the
old
gray
woman
a
sublime
spectre
standing
beside
her
grandchild
s
pillow
terror
and
vengeance
wrote
their
fierce
expressions
in
the
wrinkles
that
lined
her
skin
of
yellow
ivory
her
forehead
half
hidden
by
the
straggling
meshes
of
her
gray
hair
expressed
a
solemn
anger
she
read
with
a
power
of
intuition
given
to
the
aged
when
near
their
grave
pierrette
s
whole
life
on
which
her
mind
had
dwelt
throughout
her
journey
she
divined
the
illness
of
her
darling
and
knew
that
she
was
threatened
with
death
two
big
tears
painfully
rose
in
her
wan
gray
eyes
from
which
her
troubles
had
worn
both
lashes
and
eyebrows
two
pearls
of
anguish
forming
within
them
and
giving
them
a
dreadful
brightness
then
each
tear
swelled
and
rolled
down
the
withered
cheek
but
did
not
wet
it
they
have
killed
her
she
said
at
last
clasping
her
hands
she
fell
on
her
knees
which
struck
sharp
blows
on
the
floor
making
a
vow
no
doubt
to
saint
anne
d
auray
the
most
powerful
of
the
madonnas
of
brittany
a
doctor
from
paris
she
said
to
brigaut
go
and
fetch
one
brigaut
go
she
took
him
by
the
shoulder
and
gave
him
a
despotic
push
to
send
him
from
the
room
i
was
coming
my
lad
when
you
wrote
me
i
am
rich
here
take
this
she
cried
recalling
him
and
unfastening
as
she
spoke
the
strings
that
tied
her
then
she
drew
a
paper
from
her
bosom
in
which
were
saying
take
what
is
necessary
and
bring
back
the
greatest
doctor
in
keep
those
said
frappier
he
can
t
change
thousand
franc
notes
now
i
have
money
and
the
diligence
will
be
passing
presently
he
can
certainly
find
a
place
on
it
but
before
he
goes
we
had
better
consult
doctor
martener
he
will
tell
us
the
best
physician
in
paris
the
diligence
won
t
pass
for
over
an
hour
we
have
time
brigaut
woke
up
monsieur
martener
and
brought
him
at
once
the
doctor
was
not
a
little
surprised
to
find
mademoiselle
lorrain
at
frappier
s
brigaut
told
him
of
the
scene
that
had
just
taken
place
at
the
rogrons
but
even
so
the
doctor
did
not
at
first
suspect
the
horror
of
it
nor
the
extent
of
the
injury
done
martener
gave
the
address
of
the
celebrated
horace
bianchon
and
brigaut
started
for
paris
by
the
diligence
monsieur
martener
then
sat
down
and
examined
first
the
bruised
and
bloody
hand
which
lay
outside
the
bed
she
could
not
have
given
these
wounds
herself
he
said
no
the
horrible
woman
to
whom
i
had
the
misfortune
to
trust
her
was
murdering
her
said
the
grandmother
my
poor
pierrette
was
screaming
help
help
i
m
dying
enough
to
touch
the
heart
of
an
but
why
was
it
said
the
doctor
feeling
pierrette
s
pulse
she
is
very
ill
he
added
examining
her
with
a
light
she
must
have
suffered
terribly
i
don
t
understand
why
she
has
not
been
properly
cared
i
shall
complain
to
the
authorities
said
the
grandmother
those
rogrons
asked
me
for
my
child
in
a
letter
saying
they
had
twelve
thousand
francs
a
year
and
would
take
care
of
her
had
they
the
right
to
make
her
their
servant
and
force
her
to
do
work
for
which
she
had
not
the
strength
they
did
not
choose
to
see
the
most
visible
of
all
maladies
to
which
young
girls
are
liable
she
needed
the
utmost
care
cried
monsieur
martener
pierrette
was
awakened
by
the
light
which
madame
frappier
was
holding
near
her
face
and
by
the
horrible
sufferings
in
her
head
caused
by
the
reaction
of
her
struggle
ah
monsieur
martener
i
am
very
ill
she
said
in
her
pretty
voice
where
is
the
pain
my
little
friend
asked
the
doctor
here
she
said
touching
her
head
above
the
left
ear
there
s
an
abscess
said
the
doctor
after
feeling
the
head
for
a
long
time
and
questioning
pierrette
on
her
sufferings
you
must
tell
us
all
my
child
so
that
we
may
know
how
to
cure
you
why
is
your
hand
like
this
you
could
not
have
given
yourself
that
pierrette
related
the
struggle
between
herself
and
her
cousin
sylvie
make
her
talk
said
the
doctor
to
the
grandmother
and
find
out
the
whole
truth
i
will
await
the
arrival
of
the
doctor
from
paris
and
we
will
send
for
the
surgeon
in
charge
of
the
hospital
here
and
have
a
consultation
the
case
seems
to
me
a
very
serious
one
meantime
i
will
send
you
a
quieting
draught
so
that
mademoiselle
may
sleep
she
needs
left
alone
with
her
granddaughter
the
old
breton
woman
exerted
her
influence
over
the
child
and
made
her
tell
all
she
let
her
know
that
she
had
money
enough
now
for
all
three
and
promised
that
brigaut
should
live
with
them
the
poor
girl
admitted
her
martyrdom
not
imagining
the
events
to
which
her
admissions
would
give
rise
the
monstrosity
of
two
beings
without
affection
and
without
conception
of
family
life
opened
to
the
old
woman
a
world
of
woe
as
far
from
her
knowledge
as
the
morals
of
savages
may
have
seemed
to
the
first
discoverers
who
set
foot
in
america
the
arrival
of
her
grandmother
the
certainty
of
living
with
her
in
comfort
soothed
pierrette
s
mind
as
the
sleeping
draught
soothed
her
body
the
old
woman
watched
her
darling
kissing
her
forehead
hair
and
hands
as
the
holy
women
of
old
kissed
the
hands
of
jesus
when
they
laid
him
in
the
tomb
ix
the
family
council
at
nine
o
clock
that
morning
monsieur
martener
went
to
see
monsieur
tiphaine
and
related
to
him
the
scene
between
pierrette
and
sylvie
and
the
tortures
of
all
kinds
moral
and
physical
to
which
the
rogrons
had
subjected
their
cousin
and
the
two
alarming
forms
of
illness
which
their
cruelty
had
developed
monsieur
tiphaine
sent
for
auffray
the
notary
one
of
pierrette
s
own
relations
on
the
maternal
side
at
this
particular
time
the
war
between
the
vinet
party
and
the
tiphaine
party
was
at
its
height
the
scandals
which
the
rogrons
and
their
adherents
were
disseminating
through
the
town
about
the
liaison
of
madame
tiphaine
s
mother
with
the
banker
du
tillet
and
the
bankruptcy
of
her
father
a
forger
they
said
were
all
the
more
exasperating
to
the
tiphaines
because
these
things
were
malicious
truths
not
libels
such
wounds
cut
deep
they
go
to
the
quick
of
feelings
and
of
interests
these
speeches
repeated
to
the
partisans
of
the
tiphaines
by
the
same
mouths
which
told
the
rogrons
of
the
sneers
of
those
women
of
the
tiphaine
clique
fed
the
hatreds
of
both
sides
now
increased
by
the
political
element
the
animosities
caused
at
this
time
in
france
by
the
spirit
of
party
the
violences
of
which
were
excessive
were
everywhere
mixed
up
as
in
provins
with
selfish
schemes
and
wounded
or
vindictive
individual
interests
each
party
eagerly
seized
on
whatever
might
injure
the
rival
party
personal
hatreds
and
mingled
as
much
as
political
animosity
in
even
the
smallest
matters
and
were
carried
to
hitherto
lengths
a
whole
town
would
be
roused
to
excitement
over
some
private
struggle
until
it
took
the
character
of
a
political
debate
monsieur
tiphaine
at
once
perceived
in
the
case
of
pierrette
against
the
rogrons
a
means
of
humbling
mortifying
and
dishonoring
the
masters
of
that
salon
where
plans
against
the
monarchy
were
made
and
an
opposition
journal
born
the
public
prosecutor
was
called
in
and
together
with
monsieur
auffray
the
notary
pierrette
s
relation
and
monsieur
martener
a
cautious
consultation
was
held
in
the
utmost
secrecy
as
to
the
proper
course
to
follow
monsieur
martener
agreed
to
advise
pierrette
s
grandmother
to
apply
to
the
courts
to
have
auffray
appointed
guardian
to
his
young
relation
the
guardian
could
then
convene
a
family
council
and
backed
by
the
testimony
of
three
doctors
demand
the
girl
s
release
from
the
authority
of
the
rogrons
the
affair
thus
managed
would
have
to
go
before
the
courts
and
the
public
prosecutor
monsieur
lesourd
would
see
that
it
was
taken
to
a
criminal
court
by
demanding
an
inquiry
towards
midday
all
provins
was
roused
by
the
strange
news
of
what
had
happened
during
the
night
at
the
rogrons
pierrette
s
cries
had
been
faintly
heard
though
they
were
soon
over
no
one
had
risen
to
inquire
what
they
meant
but
every
one
said
the
next
day
did
you
hear
those
screams
about
one
in
the
morning
gossip
and
comments
soon
magnified
the
horrible
drama
and
a
crowd
collected
in
front
of
frappier
s
shop
asking
the
worthy
for
information
and
hearing
from
him
how
pierrette
was
brought
to
his
house
with
her
fingers
broken
and
the
hand
bloody
towards
one
in
the
afternoon
the
of
doctor
bianchon
who
was
accompanied
by
brigaut
stopped
before
the
house
and
madame
frappier
went
at
once
to
summon
monsieur
martener
and
the
surgeon
in
charge
of
the
hospital
thus
the
gossip
of
the
town
received
confirmation
the
rogrons
were
declared
to
have
their
cousin
deliberately
and
to
have
come
near
killing
her
vinet
heard
the
news
while
attending
to
his
business
in
the
law
courts
he
left
everything
and
hurried
to
the
rogrons
rogron
and
his
sister
had
just
finished
breakfast
sylvie
was
reluctant
to
tell
her
brother
of
her
discomfiture
of
the
night
before
but
he
pressed
her
with
questions
to
which
she
would
make
no
answer
than
that
s
not
your
she
went
and
came
from
the
kitchen
to
the
on
pretence
of
preparing
the
breakfast
but
chiefly
to
avoid
discussion
she
was
alone
when
vinet
entered
you
know
what
s
happened
said
the
lawyer
no
said
sylvie
you
will
be
arrested
on
a
criminal
charge
replied
vinet
from
the
way
things
are
now
going
about
a
criminal
charge
cried
rogron
who
had
come
into
the
room
why
what
for
first
of
all
said
the
lawyer
looking
at
sylvie
explain
to
me
without
concealment
and
as
if
you
stood
before
god
what
happened
in
this
house
last
night
they
talk
of
amputating
pierrette
s
sylvie
turned
livid
and
shuddered
then
there
is
some
truth
in
it
said
vinet
mademoiselle
rogron
related
the
scene
trying
to
excuse
herself
but
prodded
with
questions
she
acknowledged
the
facts
of
the
horrible
struggle
if
you
have
only
injured
her
fingers
you
will
be
taken
before
the
police
court
for
a
misdemeanor
but
if
they
cut
off
her
hand
you
may
be
tried
at
the
assizes
for
a
worse
offence
the
tiphaines
will
do
their
best
to
get
you
sylvie
more
dead
than
alive
confessed
her
jealousy
and
what
was
harder
to
do
confessed
also
that
her
suspicions
were
unfounded
heavens
what
a
case
this
will
make
cried
the
lawyer
you
and
your
brother
may
be
ruined
by
it
you
will
be
abandoned
by
most
people
whether
you
win
or
lose
if
you
lose
you
will
have
to
leave
oh
my
dear
monsieur
vinet
you
who
are
such
a
great
lawyer
said
rogron
terrified
advise
us
save
us
the
crafty
vinet
worked
the
terror
of
the
two
imbeciles
to
its
utmost
declaring
that
madame
and
mademoiselle
de
chargeboeuf
might
be
unwilling
to
enter
their
house
again
to
be
abandoned
by
women
of
their
rank
would
be
a
terrible
condemnation
at
length
after
an
hour
of
adroit
manoeuvring
it
was
agreed
that
vinet
must
have
some
powerful
motive
in
taking
the
case
that
would
impress
the
minds
of
all
provins
and
explain
his
efforts
on
behalf
of
the
rogrons
this
motive
they
determined
should
be
rogron
s
marriage
to
mademoiselle
de
chargeboeuf
it
should
be
announced
that
very
day
and
the
banns
published
on
sunday
the
contract
could
be
drawn
immediately
mademoiselle
rogron
agreed
in
consideration
of
the
marriage
to
appear
in
the
contract
as
settling
her
capital
on
her
brother
retaining
only
the
income
of
it
vinet
made
rogron
and
his
sister
comprehend
the
necessity
of
antedating
the
document
by
two
or
three
days
so
as
to
commit
the
mother
and
daughter
in
the
eyes
of
the
public
and
give
them
a
reason
for
continuing
their
visits
sign
that
contract
and
i
ll
take
upon
myself
to
get
you
safely
out
of
this
affair
said
the
lawyer
there
will
be
a
terrible
fight
but
i
will
put
my
whole
soul
into
it
you
ll
have
to
make
me
a
votive
oh
yes
yes
said
rogron
by
eleven
the
lawyer
had
plenary
powers
to
draw
the
contract
and
conduct
the
defence
of
the
rogrons
at
twelve
o
clock
application
was
made
to
monsieur
tiphaine
as
a
judge
sitting
in
chambers
against
brigaut
and
the
widow
lorrain
for
having
abducted
pierrette
lorrain
a
minor
from
the
house
of
her
legal
guardian
in
this
way
the
bold
lawyer
became
the
aggressor
and
made
rogron
the
injured
party
he
spoke
of
the
matter
from
this
point
of
view
in
the
the
judge
postponed
the
hearing
till
four
o
clock
needless
to
describe
the
excitement
in
the
town
monsieur
tiphaine
knew
that
by
three
o
clock
the
consultation
of
doctors
would
be
over
and
their
report
drawn
up
he
wished
auffray
as
to
be
at
the
hearing
armed
with
that
report
the
announcement
of
rogron
s
marriage
and
the
sacrifices
made
to
it
by
sylvie
in
the
contract
alienated
two
important
supporters
from
the
brother
and
sister
namely
mademoiselle
habert
and
the
colonel
whose
hopes
were
thus
annihilated
they
remained
however
ostensibly
on
the
rogron
side
for
the
purpose
of
injuring
it
consequently
as
soon
as
monsieur
martener
mentioned
the
alarming
condition
of
pierrette
s
head
celeste
and
the
colonel
told
of
the
blow
she
had
given
herself
during
the
evening
when
sylvie
had
forced
her
to
leave
the
salon
and
they
related
the
old
maid
s
barbarous
and
unfeeling
comments
with
other
statements
proving
her
cruelty
to
her
suffering
cousin
vinet
had
foreseen
this
storm
but
he
had
secured
the
entire
fortune
of
the
rogrons
for
mademoiselle
de
chargeboeuf
and
he
promised
himself
that
in
a
few
weeks
she
should
be
mistress
of
the
rogron
house
and
reign
with
him
over
provins
and
even
bring
about
a
fusion
with
the
breauteys
and
the
aristocrats
in
the
interests
of
his
ambition
from
midday
to
four
o
clock
all
the
ladies
of
the
tiphaine
clique
sent
to
inquire
after
mademoiselle
lorrain
she
poor
girl
was
wholly
ignorant
of
the
commotion
she
was
causing
in
the
little
town
in
the
midst
of
her
sufferings
she
was
ineffably
happy
in
recovering
her
grandmother
and
brigaut
the
two
objects
of
her
affection
brigaut
s
eyes
were
constantly
full
of
tears
the
old
grandmother
sat
by
the
bed
and
caressed
her
darling
to
the
three
doctors
she
told
every
detail
she
had
obtained
from
pierrette
as
to
her
life
in
the
rogron
house
horace
bianchon
expressed
his
indignation
in
vehement
language
shocked
at
such
barbarity
he
insisted
on
all
the
physicians
in
the
town
being
called
in
to
see
the
case
the
consequence
was
that
neraud
the
friend
of
the
rogrons
was
present
the
report
was
unanimously
signed
it
is
useless
to
give
a
text
of
it
here
if
moliere
s
medical
terms
were
barbarous
those
of
modern
science
have
the
advantage
of
being
so
clear
that
the
explanation
of
pierrette
s
malady
though
natural
and
unfortunately
common
horrified
all
ears
at
four
o
clock
after
the
usual
rising
of
the
court
president
tiphaine
again
took
his
seat
when
madame
lorrain
accompanied
by
monsieur
auffray
and
brigaut
and
a
crowd
of
interested
persons
entered
the
vinet
was
alone
this
contrast
struck
the
minds
of
those
present
the
lawyer
who
still
wore
his
robe
turned
his
cold
face
to
the
judge
settled
his
spectacles
on
his
pallid
green
eyes
and
then
in
a
shrill
persistent
voice
he
stated
that
two
strangers
had
forced
themselves
at
night
into
the
rogron
domicile
and
had
abducted
therefrom
the
minor
lorrain
the
legal
rights
were
with
the
guardian
who
now
demanded
the
restoration
of
his
ward
monsieur
auffray
rose
as
and
requested
to
be
heard
if
the
judge
he
said
will
admit
the
report
which
i
hold
in
my
hand
signed
by
one
of
the
most
famous
physicians
in
paris
and
by
all
the
physicians
in
provins
he
will
understand
not
only
that
the
demand
of
the
sieur
rogron
is
senseless
but
also
that
the
grandmother
of
the
minor
had
grave
cause
to
instantly
remove
her
from
her
persecutors
here
are
the
facts
the
report
of
these
physicians
attribute
the
almost
dying
condition
of
the
said
minor
to
the
she
has
received
from
the
sieur
rogron
and
his
sister
we
shall
as
the
law
directs
convoke
a
family
council
with
the
least
possible
delay
and
discuss
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
guardian
should
be
deposed
and
we
now
ask
that
the
minor
be
not
returned
to
the
domicile
of
the
said
guardian
but
that
she
be
confided
to
some
member
of
her
family
who
shall
be
designated
by
the
vinet
replied
declaring
that
the
physicians
report
ought
to
have
been
submitted
to
him
in
order
that
he
might
have
disproved
it
not
submitted
to
your
side
said
the
judge
severely
but
possibly
to
the
du
the
case
is
the
judge
then
wrote
at
the
bottom
of
the
petition
the
following
order
whereas
it
appears
from
a
deliberate
and
unanimous
report
of
all
the
physicians
of
this
town
together
with
doctor
bianchon
of
the
medical
faculty
of
paris
that
the
minor
lorrain
claimed
by
rogron
her
guardian
is
extremely
ill
in
consequence
of
and
personal
assault
in
the
house
of
the
said
guardian
and
his
sister
we
president
of
the
court
of
provins
passing
upon
the
said
petition
order
that
until
the
family
council
is
held
the
minor
lorrain
is
not
to
be
returned
to
the
household
of
her
said
guardian
but
shall
be
kept
in
that
of
her
and
further
considering
the
state
in
which
the
said
minor
now
is
and
the
traces
of
violence
which
according
to
the
report
of
the
physicians
are
now
upon
her
person
we
commission
the
attending
physician
and
the
surgeon
in
charge
of
the
hospital
of
provins
to
visit
her
and
in
case
the
injuries
from
the
said
assault
become
alarming
the
matter
will
be
held
to
await
the
action
of
the
criminal
courts
and
this
without
prejudice
to
the
civil
suit
undertaken
by
auffray
the
this
severe
judgment
was
read
out
by
president
tiphaine
in
a
loud
and
distinct
voice
why
not
send
them
to
the
galleys
at
once
said
vinet
and
all
this
fuss
about
a
girl
who
was
carrying
on
an
intrigue
with
an
apprentice
to
a
if
the
case
goes
on
in
this
way
he
cried
insolently
we
shall
demand
other
judges
on
the
ground
of
legitimate
vinet
left
the
and
went
among
the
chief
men
of
his
party
to
explain
rogron
s
position
declaring
that
he
had
never
so
much
as
given
a
flip
to
his
cousin
and
that
the
judge
had
viewed
him
much
less
as
pierrette
s
guardian
than
as
a
leading
elector
in
provins
to
hear
vinet
people
might
have
supposed
that
the
tiphaines
were
making
a
great
fuss
about
nothing
the
mounting
was
bringing
forth
a
mouse
sylvie
an
eminently
virtuous
and
pious
woman
had
discovered
an
intrigue
between
her
brother
s
ward
and
a
workman
a
breton
named
brigaut
the
scoundrel
knew
very
well
that
the
girl
would
have
her
grandmother
s
money
and
he
wished
to
seduce
her
vinet
to
talk
of
that
mademoiselle
rogron
who
had
discovered
letters
proving
the
depravity
of
the
girl
was
not
as
much
to
blame
as
the
tiphaines
were
trying
to
make
out
if
she
did
use
some
violence
to
get
possession
of
those
letters
which
was
no
wonder
when
we
consider
what
breton
obstinacy
is
how
could
rogron
be
considered
responsible
for
all
that
the
lawyer
went
on
to
make
the
matter
a
partisan
affair
and
to
give
it
a
political
color
they
who
listen
to
only
one
bell
hear
only
one
sound
said
the
wise
men
have
you
heard
what
vinet
says
vinet
explains
things
frappier
s
house
being
thought
injurious
to
pierrette
owing
to
the
noise
in
the
street
which
increased
the
sufferings
in
her
head
she
was
taken
to
that
of
her
surrogate
guardian
the
change
being
as
necessary
medically
as
it
was
judicially
the
removal
was
made
with
the
utmost
caution
and
was
calculated
to
produce
a
great
public
effect
pierrette
was
laid
on
a
mattress
and
carried
on
a
stretcher
by
two
men
a
gray
sister
walked
beside
her
with
a
bottle
of
sal
volatile
in
her
hand
while
the
grandmother
brigaut
madame
auffray
and
her
maid
followed
people
were
at
their
windows
and
doors
to
see
the
procession
pass
certainly
the
state
in
which
they
saw
pierrette
pale
as
death
gave
immense
advantage
to
the
party
against
the
rogrons
the
auffrays
were
determined
to
prove
to
the
whole
town
that
the
judge
was
right
in
the
decision
he
had
given
pierrette
and
her
grandmother
were
installed
on
the
second
floor
of
monsieur
auffray
s
house
the
notary
and
his
wife
gave
her
every
care
with
the
greatest
hospitality
which
was
not
without
a
little
ostentation
in
it
pierrette
had
her
grandmother
to
nurse
her
and
monsieur
martener
and
the
of
the
hospital
attended
her
on
the
evening
of
this
day
exaggerations
began
on
both
sides
the
rogron
salon
was
crowded
vinet
had
stirred
up
the
whole
liberal
party
on
the
subject
the
chargeboeuf
ladies
dined
with
the
rogrons
for
the
contract
was
to
be
signed
that
evening
vinet
had
had
the
banns
posted
at
the
mayor
s
office
in
the
afternoon
he
made
light
of
the
pierrette
affair
if
the
provins
court
was
prejudiced
the
royal
courts
would
appreciate
the
facts
he
said
and
the
auffrays
would
think
twice
before
they
flung
themselves
into
such
a
suit
the
alliance
of
the
rogrons
with
the
chargeboeufs
was
an
immense
consideration
in
the
minds
of
a
certain
class
of
people
to
them
it
made
the
rogrons
as
white
as
snow
and
pierrette
an
evilly
disposed
little
girl
a
serpent
warmed
in
their
bosom
in
madame
tiphaine
s
salon
vengeance
was
had
for
all
the
mischievous
scandals
that
the
vinet
party
had
disseminated
for
the
past
two
years
the
rogrons
were
monsters
and
the
guardian
should
undergo
a
criminal
trial
in
the
lower
town
pierrette
was
quite
well
in
the
upper
town
she
was
dying
at
the
rogrons
she
scratched
her
wrist
at
madame
tiphaine
s
her
fingers
were
fractured
and
one
was
to
be
cut
off
the
next
day
the
courrier
de
provins
had
a
plausible
article
extremely
a
masterpiece
of
insinuations
mixed
with
legal
points
which
showed
that
there
was
no
case
whatever
against
rogron
the
which
did
not
appear
till
two
days
later
could
not
answer
without
becoming
defamatory
it
replied
however
that
in
an
affair
like
this
it
was
best
to
wait
until
the
law
took
its
course
the
family
council
was
selected
by
the
de
of
the
canton
of
provins
and
consisted
of
rogron
and
the
two
messieurs
auffray
the
nearest
relatives
and
monsieur
ciprey
nephew
of
pierrette
s
maternal
grandmother
to
these
were
joined
monsieur
habert
pierrette
s
confessor
and
colonel
gouraud
who
had
always
professed
himself
a
comrade
and
friend
of
her
father
colonel
lorrain
the
impartiality
of
the
judge
in
these
selections
was
much
applauded
monsieur
habert
and
colonel
gouraud
being
considered
the
firm
friends
of
the
rogrons
the
serious
situation
in
which
rogron
found
himself
made
him
ask
for
the
assistance
of
a
lawyer
and
he
named
vinet
at
the
family
council
by
this
manoeuvre
evidently
advised
by
vinet
himself
rogron
succeeded
in
postponing
the
meeting
of
the
council
till
the
end
of
december
at
that
time
monsieur
tiphaine
and
his
wife
would
be
settled
in
paris
for
the
opening
of
the
chambers
and
the
ministerial
party
would
be
left
without
its
head
vinet
had
already
worked
upon
desfondrilles
the
in
case
the
matter
should
go
after
the
hearing
before
the
council
to
the
criminal
courts
vinet
spoke
for
three
hours
before
the
family
council
he
proved
the
existence
of
an
intrigue
between
pierrette
and
brigaut
which
justified
all
mademoiselle
rogron
s
severity
he
showed
how
natural
it
was
that
the
guardian
should
have
left
the
management
of
his
ward
to
a
woman
he
dwelt
on
the
fact
that
rogron
had
not
interfered
with
pierrette
s
education
as
planned
by
his
sister
sylvie
but
in
spite
of
vinet
s
efforts
the
council
were
unanimous
in
removing
rogron
from
the
guardianship
monsieur
auffray
was
appointed
in
his
place
and
monsieur
ciprey
was
made
surrogate
the
council
summoned
before
it
and
examined
adele
the
who
testified
against
her
late
masters
also
mademoiselle
habert
who
related
the
cruel
remarks
made
by
mademoiselle
rogron
on
the
evening
when
pierrette
had
given
herself
a
frightful
blow
heard
by
all
the
company
and
the
speech
of
madame
de
chargeboeuf
about
the
girl
s
health
brigaut
produced
the
letter
he
had
received
from
pierrette
which
proved
their
innocence
and
stated
her
proof
was
given
that
the
condition
of
the
minor
was
the
result
of
neglect
on
the
part
of
the
guardian
who
was
responsible
for
all
that
concerned
his
ward
pierrette
s
illness
had
been
apparent
to
every
one
even
to
persons
in
the
town
who
were
strangers
to
the
family
yet
the
guardian
had
done
nothing
for
her
the
charge
of
was
therefore
sustained
against
rogron
and
the
case
would
now
go
before
the
public
rogron
advised
by
vinet
opposed
the
acceptance
of
the
report
of
the
council
by
the
court
the
authorities
then
intervened
in
consequence
of
pierrette
s
state
which
was
daily
growing
worse
the
trial
of
the
case
though
placed
at
once
upon
the
docket
was
postponed
until
the
month
of
march
to
wait
events
verdicts
legal
and
other
meantime
rogron
s
marriage
with
mademoiselle
de
chargeboeuf
took
place
sylvie
moved
to
the
second
floor
of
the
house
which
she
shared
with
madame
de
chargeboeuf
for
the
first
floor
was
entirely
taken
up
by
the
new
wife
the
beautiful
madame
rogron
succeeded
to
the
social
place
of
the
beautiful
madame
tiphaine
the
influence
of
the
marriage
was
immense
no
one
now
came
to
visit
sylvie
but
madame
rogron
s
salon
was
always
full
sustained
by
the
influence
of
his
and
the
bankers
du
tillet
and
nucingen
monsieur
tiphaine
was
fortunate
enough
to
do
some
service
to
the
administration
he
became
one
of
its
chief
orators
was
made
judge
in
the
civil
courts
and
obtained
the
appointment
of
his
nephew
lesourd
to
his
own
vacant
place
as
president
of
the
court
of
provins
this
appointment
greatly
annoyed
desfondrilles
the
keeper
of
the
seals
sent
down
one
of
his
own
proteges
to
fill
lesourd
s
place
the
promotion
of
monsieur
tiphaine
and
his
translation
to
paris
were
therefore
of
no
benefit
at
all
to
the
vinet
party
but
vinet
nevertheless
made
a
clever
use
of
the
result
he
had
always
told
the
provins
people
that
they
were
being
used
as
a
to
raise
the
crafty
madame
tiphaine
into
grandeur
tiphaine
himself
had
tricked
them
madame
tiphaine
despised
both
provins
and
its
people
in
her
heart
and
would
never
return
there
again
just
at
this
crisis
monsieur
tiphaine
s
father
died
his
son
inherited
a
fine
estate
and
sold
his
house
in
provins
to
monsieur
julliard
the
sale
proved
to
the
minds
of
all
how
little
the
tiphaines
thought
of
provins
vinet
was
right
vinet
had
been
a
true
prophet
these
things
had
great
influence
on
the
question
of
pierrette
s
guardianship
thus
the
dreadful
martyrdom
brutally
inflicted
on
the
poor
child
by
two
imbecile
tyrants
which
led
through
its
consequences
to
the
terrible
operation
of
trepanning
performed
by
monsieur
martener
under
the
advice
of
doctor
bianchon
all
this
horrible
drama
reduced
to
judicial
form
was
left
to
float
in
the
vile
mess
called
in
legal
parlance
the
calendar
the
case
was
made
to
drag
through
the
delays
and
the
interminable
labyrinths
of
the
law
by
the
shufflings
of
an
unprincipled
lawyer
and
during
all
this
time
the
calumniated
girl
languished
in
the
agony
of
the
worst
pain
known
to
science
monsieur
martener
together
with
the
auffray
family
were
soon
charmed
by
the
beauty
of
pierrette
s
nature
and
the
character
of
her
old
grandmother
whose
feelings
ideas
and
ways
bore
the
stamp
of
roman
antiquity
this
matron
of
the
marais
was
like
a
woman
in
plutarch
doctor
martener
struggled
bravely
with
death
which
already
grasped
its
prey
from
the
first
bianchon
and
the
hospital
surgeon
had
considered
pierrette
doomed
and
there
now
took
place
between
the
doctor
and
the
disease
the
former
relying
on
pierrette
s
youth
one
of
those
struggles
which
physicians
alone
comprehend
the
reward
of
which
in
case
of
success
is
never
found
in
the
venal
pay
nor
in
the
patients
themselves
but
in
the
gentle
satisfaction
of
conscience
in
the
invisible
ideal
palm
gathered
by
true
artists
from
the
contentment
which
fills
their
soul
after
accomplishing
a
noble
work
the
physician
strains
towards
good
as
an
artist
towards
beauty
each
impelled
by
that
grand
sentiment
which
we
call
virtue
this
daily
contest
wiped
out
of
doctor
martener
s
mind
the
petty
irritations
of
that
other
contest
of
the
tiphaines
and
the
vinets
as
always
happens
to
men
when
they
find
themselves
face
to
face
with
a
great
and
real
misery
to
conquer
monsieur
martener
had
begun
his
career
in
paris
but
the
cruel
activity
of
the
city
and
its
insensibility
to
its
masses
of
suffering
had
shocked
his
gentle
soul
fitted
only
for
the
quiet
life
of
the
provinces
moreover
he
was
under
the
yoke
of
his
beautiful
native
land
he
returned
to
provins
where
he
married
and
settled
and
cared
almost
lovingly
for
the
people
who
were
to
him
like
a
large
family
during
the
whole
of
pierrette
s
illness
he
was
careful
not
to
speak
of
her
his
reluctance
to
answer
the
questions
of
those
who
asked
about
her
was
so
evident
that
persons
soon
ceased
to
put
them
pierrette
was
to
him
what
indeed
she
truly
was
a
poem
mysterious
profound
vast
in
suffering
such
as
doctors
find
at
times
in
their
terrible
experience
he
felt
an
admiration
for
this
delicate
young
creature
which
he
would
not
share
with
any
one
this
feeling
of
the
physician
for
his
patient
was
however
unconsciously
communicated
like
all
true
feelings
to
monsieur
and
madame
auffray
whose
house
became
so
long
as
pierrette
was
in
it
quiet
and
silent
the
children
who
had
formerly
played
so
joyously
with
her
agreed
among
themselves
with
the
loving
grace
of
childhood
to
be
neither
noisy
nor
troublesome
they
made
it
a
point
of
honor
to
be
good
because
pierrette
was
monsieur
auffray
s
house
was
in
the
upper
town
beneath
the
ruins
of
the
chateau
and
it
was
built
upon
a
sort
of
terrace
formed
by
the
overthrow
of
the
old
ramparts
the
occupants
could
have
a
view
of
the
valley
from
the
little
enclosed
by
walls
which
overlooked
the
town
the
roofs
of
the
other
houses
came
to
about
the
level
of
the
lower
wall
of
this
garden
along
the
terrace
ran
a
path
by
which
monsieur
auffray
s
study
could
be
entered
through
a
glass
door
at
the
other
end
of
the
path
was
an
arbor
of
grape
vines
and
a
beneath
which
stood
a
round
table
a
bench
and
some
chairs
painted
green
pierrette
s
bedroom
was
above
the
study
of
her
new
guardian
madame
lorrain
slept
in
a
cot
beside
her
grandchild
from
her
window
pierrette
could
see
the
whole
of
the
glorious
valley
of
provins
which
she
hardly
knew
so
seldom
had
she
left
that
dreadful
house
of
the
rogrons
when
the
weather
was
fine
she
loved
to
drag
herself
resting
on
her
grandmother
s
arm
to
the
arbor
brigaut
unable
to
work
came
three
times
a
day
to
see
his
little
friend
he
was
gnawed
by
a
grief
which
made
him
indifferent
to
life
he
lay
in
wait
like
a
dog
for
monsieur
martener
and
followed
him
when
he
left
the
house
the
old
grandmother
drunk
with
grief
had
the
courage
to
conceal
her
despair
she
showed
her
darling
the
smiling
face
she
formerly
wore
at
in
her
desire
to
produce
that
illusion
in
the
girl
s
mind
she
made
her
a
little
breton
cap
like
the
one
pierrette
had
worn
on
her
first
arrival
in
provins
it
made
the
darling
seem
more
like
her
childlike
self
in
it
she
was
delightful
to
look
upon
her
sweet
face
circled
with
a
halo
of
cambric
and
fluted
lace
her
skin
white
with
the
whiteness
of
unglazed
porcelain
her
forehead
where
suffering
had
printed
the
semblance
of
deep
thought
the
purity
of
the
lines
refined
by
illness
the
slowness
of
the
glances
and
the
occasional
fixity
of
the
eyes
made
pierrette
an
almost
perfect
embodiment
of
melancholy
she
was
served
by
all
with
a
sort
of
fanaticism
she
was
felt
to
be
so
gentle
so
tender
so
loving
madame
martener
sent
her
piano
to
her
sister
madame
auffray
thinking
to
amuse
pierrette
who
was
passionately
fond
of
music
it
was
a
poem
to
watch
her
listening
to
a
theme
of
weber
or
beethoven
or
herold
her
eyes
raised
her
lips
silent
regretting
no
doubt
the
life
escaping
her
the
cure
peroux
and
monsieur
habert
her
two
religious
comforters
admired
her
saintly
resignation
surely
the
seraphic
perfection
of
young
girls
and
young
men
marked
with
the
hectic
of
death
is
a
wonderful
fact
worthy
of
the
attention
alike
of
philosophers
and
of
heedless
minds
he
who
has
ever
seen
one
of
these
sublime
departures
from
this
life
can
never
remain
or
become
an
unbeliever
such
beings
exhale
as
it
were
a
celestial
fragrance
their
glances
speak
of
god
the
voices
are
eloquent
in
the
simplest
words
often
they
ring
like
some
seraphic
instrument
revealing
the
secrets
of
the
future
when
monsieur
martener
praised
her
for
having
faithfully
followed
a
harsh
prescription
the
little
angel
replied
and
with
what
a
glance
i
want
to
live
dear
monsieur
martener
but
less
for
myself
than
for
my
grandmother
for
my
brigaut
for
all
of
you
who
will
grieve
at
my
the
first
time
she
went
into
the
garden
on
a
beautiful
sunny
day
in
november
attended
by
all
the
household
madame
auffray
asked
her
if
she
was
tired
no
now
that
i
have
no
sufferings
but
those
god
sends
i
can
bear
all
she
said
the
joy
of
being
loved
gives
me
strength
to
that
was
the
only
time
and
then
vaguely
that
she
ever
alluded
to
her
horrible
martyrdom
at
the
rogrons
whom
she
never
mentioned
and
of
whom
no
one
reminded
her
knowing
well
how
painful
the
memory
must
be
dear
madame
auffray
she
said
one
day
at
noon
on
the
terrace
as
she
gazed
at
the
valley
warmed
by
a
glorious
sun
and
colored
with
the
glowing
tints
of
autumn
my
death
in
your
house
gives
me
more
happiness
than
i
have
had
since
i
left
madame
auffray
whispered
in
her
sister
martener
s
ear
how
she
would
have
loved
in
truth
her
tones
her
looks
gave
to
her
words
a
priceless
value
monsieur
martener
corresponded
with
doctor
bianchon
and
did
nothing
of
importance
without
his
advice
he
hoped
in
the
first
place
to
regular
the
functions
of
nature
and
to
draw
away
the
abscess
in
the
head
through
the
ear
the
more
pierrette
suffered
the
more
he
hoped
he
gained
some
slight
success
at
times
and
that
was
a
great
triumph
for
several
days
pierrette
s
appetite
returned
and
enabled
her
to
take
nourishing
food
for
which
her
illness
had
given
her
a
repugnance
the
color
of
her
skin
changed
but
the
condition
of
her
head
was
terrible
monsieur
martener
entreated
the
great
physician
his
adviser
to
come
down
bianchon
came
stayed
two
days
and
resolved
to
undertake
an
operation
to
spare
the
feelings
of
poor
martener
he
went
to
paris
and
brought
back
with
him
the
celebrated
desplein
thus
the
operation
was
performed
by
the
greatest
surgeon
of
ancient
or
modern
times
but
that
terrible
diviner
said
to
martener
as
he
departed
with
bianchon
his
pupil
nothing
but
a
miracle
can
save
her
as
horace
told
you
caries
of
the
bone
has
begun
at
her
age
the
bones
are
so
the
operation
was
performed
at
the
beginning
of
march
during
all
that
month
distressed
by
pierrette
s
horrible
sufferings
monsieur
martener
made
several
journeys
to
paris
there
he
consulted
desplein
and
bianchon
and
even
went
so
far
as
to
propose
to
them
an
operation
of
the
nature
of
lithotrity
which
consists
in
passing
into
the
head
a
hollow
instrument
by
the
help
of
which
an
heroic
remedy
can
be
applied
to
the
diseased
bone
to
arrest
the
progress
of
the
caries
even
the
bold
desplein
dared
not
attempt
that
surgical
measure
which
despair
alone
had
suggested
to
martener
when
he
returned
home
from
paris
he
seemed
to
his
friends
morose
and
gloomy
he
was
forced
to
announce
on
that
fatal
evening
to
the
auffrays
and
madame
lorrain
and
to
the
two
priests
and
brigaut
that
science
could
do
no
more
for
pierrette
whose
recovery
was
now
in
god
s
hands
only
the
consternation
among
them
was
terrible
the
grandmother
made
a
vow
and
requested
the
priests
to
say
a
mass
every
morning
at
daybreak
before
pierrette
rose
a
mass
at
which
she
and
brigaut
might
be
present
the
trial
came
on
while
the
victim
lay
dying
vinet
was
calumniating
her
in
court
the
judge
approved
and
accepted
the
report
of
the
family
council
and
vinet
instantly
appealed
the
newly
appointed
du
made
a
requisition
which
necessitated
fresh
evidence
rogron
and
his
sister
were
forced
to
give
bail
to
avoid
going
to
prison
the
order
for
fresh
evidence
included
that
of
pierrette
herself
when
monsieur
desfondrilles
came
to
the
auffrays
to
receive
it
pierrette
was
dying
her
confessor
was
at
her
bedside
about
to
administer
extreme
unction
at
that
moment
she
entreated
all
present
to
forgive
her
cousins
as
she
herself
forgave
them
saying
with
her
simple
good
sense
that
the
judgment
of
these
things
belonged
to
god
alone
grandmother
she
said
leave
all
you
have
to
brigaut
brigaut
burst
into
tears
and
continued
pierrette
give
a
thousand
francs
to
that
kind
adele
who
warmed
my
bed
if
adele
had
remained
with
my
cousins
i
should
not
now
be
it
was
at
three
o
clock
on
the
tuesday
of
easter
week
on
a
beautiful
bright
day
that
the
angel
ceased
to
suffer
her
heroic
grandmother
wished
to
watch
all
that
night
with
the
priests
and
to
sew
with
her
stiff
old
fingers
her
darling
s
shroud
towards
evening
brigaut
left
the
auffray
s
house
and
went
to
frappier
s
i
need
not
ask
you
my
poor
boy
for
news
said
the
pere
frappier
yes
it
is
ended
for
her
but
not
for
he
cast
a
look
upon
the
different
woods
piled
up
around
the
shop
a
look
of
painful
meaning
i
understand
you
brigaut
said
his
worthy
master
take
all
you
and
he
showed
him
the
oaken
planks
of
thickness
don
t
help
me
monsieur
frappier
said
the
breton
i
wish
to
do
it
he
passed
the
night
in
planing
and
fitting
pierrette
s
coffin
and
more
than
once
his
plane
took
off
at
a
single
pass
a
ribbon
of
wood
which
was
wet
with
tears
the
good
man
frappier
smoked
his
pipe
and
watched
him
silently
saying
only
when
the
four
pieces
were
joined
together
make
the
cover
to
slide
her
poor
grandmother
will
not
hear
the
at
daybreak
brigaut
went
out
to
fetch
the
lead
to
line
the
coffin
by
a
strange
chance
the
sheets
of
lead
cost
just
the
sum
he
had
given
pierrette
for
her
journey
from
nantes
to
provins
the
brave
breton
who
was
able
to
resist
the
awful
pain
of
himself
making
the
coffin
of
his
dear
one
and
lining
with
his
memories
those
burial
planks
could
not
bear
up
against
this
strange
reminder
his
strength
gave
way
he
was
not
able
to
lift
the
lead
and
the
plumber
seeing
this
came
with
him
and
offered
to
accompany
him
to
the
house
and
solder
the
last
sheet
when
the
body
had
been
laid
in
the
coffin
the
breton
burned
the
plane
and
all
the
tools
he
had
used
then
he
settled
his
accounts
with
frappier
and
bade
him
farewell
the
heroism
with
which
the
poor
lad
personally
performed
like
the
grandmother
the
last
offices
for
pierrette
made
him
a
sharer
in
the
awful
scene
which
crowned
the
tyranny
of
the
rogrons
brigaut
and
the
plumber
reached
the
house
of
monsieur
auffray
just
in
time
to
decide
by
their
own
main
force
an
infamous
and
shocking
judicial
question
the
room
where
the
dead
girl
lay
was
full
of
people
and
presented
to
the
eyes
of
the
two
men
a
singular
sight
the
rogron
emissaries
were
standing
beside
the
body
of
their
victim
to
torture
her
even
after
death
the
corpse
of
the
child
solemn
in
its
beauty
lay
on
the
of
her
grandmother
pierrette
s
eyes
were
closed
the
brown
hair
smoothed
upon
her
brow
the
body
swathed
in
a
coarse
cotton
sheet
before
the
bed
on
her
knees
her
hair
in
disorder
her
hands
stretched
out
her
face
on
fire
the
old
lorrain
was
crying
out
no
no
it
shall
not
be
done
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
stood
monsieur
auffray
and
the
two
priests
the
tapers
were
still
burning
opposite
to
the
grandmother
was
the
surgeon
of
the
hospital
with
an
assistant
and
near
him
stood
doctor
neraud
and
vinet
the
surgeon
wore
his
dissecting
apron
the
assistant
had
opened
a
case
of
instruments
and
was
handing
him
a
knife
this
scene
was
interrupted
by
the
noise
of
the
coffin
which
brigaut
and
the
plumber
set
down
upon
the
floor
then
brigaut
advancing
was
horrified
at
the
sight
of
madame
lorrain
who
was
now
weeping
what
is
the
matter
he
asked
standing
beside
her
and
grasping
the
chisel
convulsively
in
his
hand
this
said
the
old
woman
brigaut
they
want
to
open
the
body
of
my
child
and
cut
into
her
head
and
stab
her
heart
after
her
death
as
they
did
when
she
was
who
said
brigaut
in
a
voice
that
might
have
deafened
the
men
of
law
the
in
the
sacred
name
of
god
stop
brigaut
said
monsieur
auffray
seeing
the
lad
brandish
his
chisel
monsieur
auffray
said
brigaut
as
white
as
his
dead
companion
i
hear
you
because
you
are
monsieur
auffray
but
at
this
moment
i
will
not
listen
to
the
law
said
auffray
is
there
law
is
there
justice
cried
the
breton
justice
this
is
it
and
he
advanced
to
the
lawyer
and
the
doctors
threatening
them
with
his
chisel
my
friend
said
the
curate
the
law
has
been
invoked
by
the
lawyer
of
monsieur
rogron
who
is
under
the
weight
of
a
serious
accusation
and
it
is
impossible
for
us
to
refuse
him
the
means
of
justification
the
lawyer
of
monsieur
rogron
claims
that
if
the
poor
child
died
of
an
abscess
in
her
head
her
former
guardian
can
not
be
blamed
for
it
is
proved
that
pierrette
concealed
the
effects
of
the
blow
which
she
gave
to
herself
enough
said
brigaut
my
client
began
vinet
your
client
cried
the
breton
shall
go
to
hell
and
i
to
the
scaffold
for
if
one
of
you
dares
to
touch
her
whom
your
client
has
killed
i
will
kill
him
if
my
weapon
does
its
this
is
interference
with
the
law
said
vinet
i
shall
instantly
inform
the
the
five
men
left
the
room
oh
my
son
cried
the
old
woman
rising
from
her
knees
and
falling
on
brigaut
s
neck
let
us
bury
her
quick
they
will
come
if
we
solder
the
lead
said
the
plumber
they
may
not
dare
to
open
monsieur
auffray
hastened
to
his
monsieur
lesourd
to
try
and
settle
the
matter
vinet
was
not
unwilling
pierrette
being
dead
the
suit
about
the
guardianship
fell
of
course
to
the
ground
all
the
astute
lawyer
wanted
was
the
effect
produced
by
his
request
at
midday
monsieur
desfondrilles
made
his
report
on
the
case
and
the
court
rendered
a
decision
that
there
was
no
ground
for
further
action
rogron
dared
not
go
to
pierrette
s
funeral
at
which
the
whole
town
was
present
vinet
wished
to
force
him
there
but
the
miserable
man
was
afraid
of
exciting
universal
horror
brigaut
left
provins
after
watching
the
filling
up
of
the
grave
where
pierrette
lay
and
went
on
foot
to
paris
he
wrote
a
petition
to
the
dauphiness
asking
in
the
name
of
his
father
that
he
might
enter
the
royal
guard
to
which
he
was
at
once
admitted
when
the
expedition
to
algiers
was
undertaken
he
wrote
to
her
again
to
obtain
employment
in
it
he
was
then
a
sergeant
marshal
bourmont
gave
him
an
appointment
as
in
a
line
regiment
the
major
s
son
behaved
like
a
man
who
wished
to
die
death
has
however
respected
jacques
brigaut
up
to
the
present
time
although
he
has
distinguished
himself
in
all
the
recent
expeditions
he
has
never
yet
been
wounded
he
is
now
major
in
a
regiment
of
infantry
no
officer
is
more
taciturn
or
more
trustworthy
outside
of
his
duty
he
is
almost
mute
he
walks
alone
and
lives
mechanically
every
one
divines
and
respects
a
hidden
sorrow
he
possesses
thousand
francs
which
old
madame
lorrain
who
died
in
paris
in
bequeathed
to
him
at
the
elections
of
vinet
was
made
a
deputy
the
services
he
rendered
the
new
government
have
now
earned
him
the
position
of
his
influence
is
such
that
he
will
always
remain
a
deputy
rogron
is
in
the
same
town
where
vinet
fulfils
his
legal
functions
and
by
one
of
those
curious
tricks
of
chance
which
do
so
often
occur
monsieur
tiphaine
is
president
of
the
royal
court
in
the
same
town
for
the
worthy
man
gave
in
his
adhesion
to
the
dynasty
of
july
without
the
slightest
hesitation
the
madame
tiphaine
lives
on
excellent
terms
with
the
beautiful
madame
rogron
vinet
is
hand
in
glove
with
madame
tiphaine
as
to
the
imbecile
rogron
he
makes
such
remarks
as
will
never
be
really
king
till
he
is
able
to
make
the
speech
is
evidently
not
his
own
his
health
is
failing
which
allows
madame
rogron
to
hope
she
may
soon
marry
the
general
marquis
de
montriveau
peer
of
france
who
commands
the
department
and
is
paying
her
attentions
vinet
is
in
his
element
seeking
victims
he
never
believes
in
the
innocence
of
an
accused
person
this
thoroughbred
prosecutor
is
held
to
be
one
of
the
most
amiable
men
on
the
circuit
and
he
is
no
less
liked
in
paris
and
in
the
chamber
at
court
he
is
a
charming
courtier
according
to
a
certain
promise
made
by
vinet
general
baron
gouraud
that
noble
relic
of
our
glorious
armies
married
a
mademoiselle
matifat
years
old
daughter
of
a
druggist
in
the
rue
des
lombards
whose
dowry
was
a
hundred
thousand
francs
he
commands
as
vinet
prophesied
a
department
in
the
neighborhood
of
paris
he
was
named
peer
of
france
for
his
conduct
in
the
riots
which
occurred
during
the
ministry
of
casimir
perier
baron
gouraud

one
of
the
generals

to
rap
those
rascally
civilians

had
vexed
him
for
years
over
the
knuckles
for
which
service
he
was
rewarded
with
the
grand
cordon
of
the
legion
of
honor
none
of
the
personages
connected
with
pierrette
s
death
ever
felt
the
slightest
remorse
about
it
monsieur
desfondrilles
is
still
archaeological
but
in
order
to
compass
his
own
election
the
vinet
took
pains
to
have
him
appointed
president
of
the
provins
court
sylvie
has
a
little
circle
and
manages
her
brother
s
property
she
lends
her
own
money
at
high
interest
and
does
not
spend
more
than
twelve
hundred
francs
a
year
from
time
to
time
when
some
former
son
or
daughter
of
provins
returns
from
paris
to
settle
down
you
may
hear
them
ask
as
they
leave
mademoiselle
rogron
s
house
wasn
t
there
a
painful
story
against
the
rogrons
something
about
a
ward
mere
prejudice
replies
monsieur
desfondrilles
certain
persons
tried
to
make
us
believe
falsehoods
out
of
kindness
of
heart
the
rogrons
took
in
a
girl
named
pierrette
quite
pretty
but
with
no
money
just
as
she
was
growing
up
she
had
an
intrigue
with
a
young
man
and
stood
at
her
window
barefooted
talking
to
him
the
lovers
passed
notes
to
each
other
by
a
string
she
took
cold
in
this
way
and
died
having
no
constitution
the
rogrons
behaved
admirably
they
made
no
claim
on
certain
property
which
was
to
come
to
her
they
gave
it
all
up
to
the
grandmother
the
moral
of
it
was
my
good
friend
that
the
devil
punishes
those
who
try
to
benefit
ah
that
is
quite
another
story
from
the
one
old
frappier
told
frappier
consults
his
more
than
he
does
his
memory
remarked
another
of
mademoiselle
rogron
s
visitors
but
that
old
priest
monsieur
habert
says
oh
he
don
t
you
know
why
he
wanted
to
marry
his
sister
to
monsieur
rogron
the
two
men
think
of
pierrette
daily
doctor
martener
and
major
brigaut
they
alone
know
the
hideous
truth
to
give
that
truth
its
true
proportions
we
must
transport
the
scene
to
the
rome
of
the
middle
ages
where
a
sublime
young
girl
beatrice
cenci
was
brought
to
the
scaffold
by
motives
and
intrigues
that
were
almost
identical
with
those
which
laid
our
pierrette
in
her
grave
beatrice
cenci
had
but
one
defender
an
artist
a
painter
in
our
day
history
and
living
men
on
the
faith
of
guido
reni
s
portrait
condemn
the
pope
and
know
that
beatrice
was
a
most
tender
victim
of
infamous
passions
and
base
feuds
we
must
all
agree
that
legality
would
be
a
fine
thing
for
social
scoundrelism

there
were
