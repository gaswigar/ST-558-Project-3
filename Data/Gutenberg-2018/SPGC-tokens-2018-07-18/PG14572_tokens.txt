a
the
christmas
angel
it
was
the
hour
of
rest
in
the
country
beyond
the
stars
all
the
silver
bells
that
swing
with
the
turning
of
the
great
ring
of
light
which
lies
around
that
land
were
softly
chiming
and
the
sound
of
their
commotion
went
down
like
dew
upon
the
golden
ways
of
the
city
and
the
long
alleys
of
blossoming
trees
and
the
meadows
of
asphodel
and
the
curving
shores
of
the
river
of
life
at
the
hearing
of
that
chime
all
the
angels
who
had
been
working
turned
to
play
and
all
who
had
been
playing
gave
themselves
joyfully
to
work
those
who
had
been
singing
and
making
melody
on
different
instruments
fell
silent
and
began
to
listen
those
who
had
been
walking
alone
in
meditation
met
together
in
companies
to
talk
and
those
who
had
been
far
away
on
errands
to
the
earth
and
other
planets
came
homeward
like
a
flight
of
swallows
to
the
high
cliff
when
the
day
is
over
it
was
not
that
they
needed
to
be
restored
from
weariness
for
the
inhabitants
of
that
country
never
say
i
am
tired
but
there
as
here
the
law
of
change
is
the
secret
of
happiness
and
the
joy
that
never
ends
is
woven
of
mingled
strands
of
labour
and
repose
society
and
solitude
music
and
silence
sleep
comes
to
them
not
as
it
does
to
us
with
a
darkening
of
the
vision
and
a
folding
of
the
wings
of
the
spirit
but
with
an
opening
of
the
eyes
to
deeper
and
fuller
light
and
with
an
effortless
outgoing
of
the
soul
upon
broader
currents
of
life
as
the
bird
poises
and
circles
upward
without
a
on
the
upholding
air
it
was
in
one
of
the
quiet
corners
of
the
green
valley
called
peacefield
where
the
little
brook
of
brighthopes
runs
smoothly
down
to
join
the
river
of
life
that
i
saw
a
company
of
angels
returned
from
various
labours
on
earth
sitting
in
friendly
converse
on
the
where
cyclamens
and
arbutus
and
violets
and
fringed
orchids
and
pale
and
all
the
flowers
which
are
separated
in
the
lower
world
by
the
seasons
were
thrown
together
in
a
harmony
of
fragrance
there
were
three
of
the
company
who
seemed
to
be
leaders
distinguished
not
only
by
more
radiant
and
powerful
looks
but
by
a
tone
of
authority
in
their
speech
and
by
the
willing
attention
with
which
the
others
listened
to
them
as
they
talked
of
their
earthly
tasks
of
the
tangles
and
troubles
the
wars
and
miseries
that
they
had
seen
among
men
and
of
the
best
way
to
get
rid
of
them
and
bring
sorrow
to
an
end
the
earth
is
full
of
oppression
and
unrighteousness
said
the
tallest
and
most
powerful
of
the
angels
his
voice
was
deep
and
strong
and
by
his
shining
armour
and
the
long
sword
hanging
over
his
shoulder
i
knew
that
he
was
the
archangel
michael
the
mightiest
one
among
the
warriors
of
the
king
and
the
executor
of
the
divine
judgments
upon
the
unjust
the
earth
is
tormented
with
injustice
he
cried
and
the
great
misery
that
i
have
seen
among
men
is
that
the
evil
hand
is
often
stronger
than
the
good
hand
and
can
beat
it
down
the
arm
of
the
cruel
is
heavier
than
the
arm
of
the
kind
the
unjust
get
the
better
of
the
just
and
tread
on
them
i
have
seen
tyrant
kings
crush
their
helpless
folk
i
have
seen
the
fields
of
the
innocent
trampled
into
bloody
ruin
by
the
feet
of
conquering
armies
i
have
seen
the
wicked
nation
overcome
the
peoples
that
loved
liberty
and
take
away
their
treasure
by
force
of
arms
i
have
seen
poverty
mocked
by
arrogant
wealth
and
purity
deflowered
by
brute
violence
and
gentleness
and
bruised
in
the
winepress
of
iniquity
and
pride
there
is
no
cure
for
this
evil
but
by
the
giving
of
greater
force
to
the
good
hand
the
righteous
cause
must
be
strengthened
with
might
to
resist
the
wicked
to
defend
the
helpless
to
punish
all
cruelty
and
unfairness
to
uphold
the
right
everywhere
and
to
enforce
justice
with
unconquerable
arms
oh
that
the
host
of
heaven
might
be
called
arrayed
and
sent
to
mingle
in
the
wars
of
men
to
make
the
good
victorious
to
destroy
all
evil
and
to
make
the
will
of
the
king
prevail
we
would
shake
down
the
thrones
of
tyrants
and
loose
the
bands
of
the
oppressed
we
would
hold
the
cruel
and
violent
with
the
bit
of
fear
and
drive
the
greedy
and
men
with
the
whip
of
terror
we
would
stand
guard
with
weapons
drawn
about
the
innocent
the
gentle
the
kind
and
keep
the
peace
of
god
with
the
sword
of
the
angels
as
he
spoke
his
hands
were
lifted
to
the
hilt
of
his
long
blade
and
he
raised
it
above
him
straight
and
shining
throwing
sparkles
of
light
around
it
like
the
spray
from
the
sharp
prow
of
a
moving
ship
bright
flames
of
heavenly
ardour
leaped
in
the
eyes
of
the
listening
angels
a
martial
air
passed
over
their
faces
as
if
they
longed
for
the
call
to
war
but
no
silver
trumpet
blared
from
the
battlements
of
the
city
of
god
no
crimson
flag
was
unfurled
on
those
high
secret
walls
no
thrilling
echoed
over
the
smooth
meadow
only
the
sound
of
the
brook
of
brighthopes
was
heard
tinkling
and
murmuring
among
the
roots
of
the
grasses
and
flowers
and
far
off
a
cadence
of
song
drifted
down
from
the
inner
courts
of
the
palace
of
the
king
then
another
angel
began
to
speak
and
made
answer
to
michael
he
too
was
tall
and
wore
the
look
of
power
but
it
was
power
of
the
mind
rather
than
of
the
hand
his
face
was
clear
and
glistening
and
his
eyes
were
lit
with
a
steady
flame
which
neither
leaped
nor
fell
of
flame
also
were
his
garments
which
clung
about
him
as
the
fire
enwraps
a
torch
burning
where
there
is
no
wind
and
his
great
wings
spiring
to
a
point
far
above
his
head
were
like
a
living
lamp
before
the
altar
of
the
most
high
by
this
sign
i
knew
that
it
was
the
archangel
uriel
the
spirit
of
the
sun
clearest
in
vision
deepest
in
wisdom
of
all
the
spirits
that
surround
the
throne
i
hold
not
the
same
thought
said
he
as
the
great
archangel
michael
nor
though
i
desire
the
same
end
which
he
desires
would
i
seek
it
by
the
same
way
for
i
know
how
often
power
has
been
given
to
the
good
and
how
often
it
has
been
turned
aside
and
used
for
evil
i
know
that
the
host
of
heaven
and
the
very
stars
in
their
courses
have
fought
on
the
side
of
a
favoured
nation
yet
pride
has
followed
triumph
and
oppression
has
been
the
child
of
victory
i
know
that
the
deliverers
of
the
people
have
become
tyrants
over
those
whom
they
have
set
free
and
the
fighters
for
liberty
have
been
changed
into
the
soldiers
of
fortune
power
corrupts
itself
and
might
can
not
save
does
not
the
prince
michael
remember
how
the
angel
of
the
lord
led
the
armies
of
israel
and
gave
them
the
battle
against
every
foe
except
the
enemy
within
the
camp
and
how
they
robbed
and
crushed
the
peoples
against
whom
they
had
fought
for
freedom
and
how
the
wickedness
of
the
tribes
of
canaan
survived
their
conquest
and
overcame
their
conquerors
so
that
the
children
of
israel
learned
to
worship
the
idols
of
their
enemies
moloch
and
baal
and
ashtoreth
power
corrupts
itself
and
might
can
not
save
was
not
persia
the
destroyer
of
babylon
and
did
not
the
tyranny
of
persia
cry
aloud
for
destruction
did
not
rome
break
the
yoke
of
the
east
and
does
not
the
yoke
of
rome
lie
heavy
on
the
shoulders
of
the
world
listen
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
on
the
slopes
of
peacefield
and
then
over
the
encircling
hills
a
cool
wind
brought
the
sound
of
chains
clanking
in
prisons
and
galleys
the
sighing
of
millions
of
slaves
the
weeping
of
wretched
women
and
children
the
blows
of
hammers
nailing
men
to
their
crosses
then
the
sound
passed
by
with
the
wind
and
uriel
spoke
again
power
corrupts
itself
and
might
can
not
save
the
earth
is
full
of
ignorant
strife
and
for
this
evil
there
is
no
cure
but
by
the
giving
of
greater
knowledge
it
is
because
men
do
not
understand
evil
that
they
yield
themselves
to
its
power
wickedness
is
folly
in
action
and
injustice
is
the
error
of
the
blind
it
is
because
men
are
ignorant
that
they
destroy
one
another
and
at
last
themselves
if
there
were
more
light
in
the
world
there
would
be
no
sorrow
if
the
great
king
who
knows
all
things
would
enlighten
the
world
with
wisdom
wisdom
to
understand
his
law
and
his
ways
to
read
the
secrets
of
the
earth
and
the
stars
to
discern
the
workings
of
the
heart
of
man
and
the
things
that
make
for
joy
and
peace
if
he
would
but
send
us
his
messengers
as
a
flame
of
fire
to
shine
upon
those
who
sit
in
darkness
how
gladly
would
we
go
to
bring
in
the
new
day
we
would
speak
the
word
of
warning
and
counsel
to
the
erring
and
tell
knowledge
to
the
perplexed
we
would
guide
the
ignorant
in
the
paths
of
prudence
and
the
young
would
sit
at
our
feet
and
hear
us
gladly
in
the
school
of
life
then
folly
would
fade
away
as
the
morning
vapour
and
the
sun
of
wisdom
would
shine
on
all
men
and
the
peace
of
god
would
come
with
the
counsel
of
the
angels
a
murmur
of
pleasure
followed
the
words
of
uriel
and
eager
looks
flashed
around
the
circle
of
the
messengers
of
light
as
they
heard
the
praise
of
wisdom
fitly
spoken
but
there
was
one
among
them
on
whose
face
a
shadow
of
doubt
rested
and
though
he
smiled
it
was
as
if
he
remembered
something
that
the
others
had
forgotten
he
turned
to
an
angel
near
him
who
was
it
said
he
to
whom
you
were
sent
with
counsel
long
ago
was
it
not
balaam
the
son
of
beor
as
he
was
riding
to
meet
the
king
of
moab
and
did
not
even
the
dumb
beast
profit
more
by
your
instruction
than
the
man
who
rode
him
and
who
was
it
he
continued
turning
to
uriel
that
was
called
the
wisest
of
all
men
having
searched
out
and
understood
the
many
inventions
that
are
found
under
the
sun
was
not
solomon
prince
of
fools
and
philosophers
unable
by
much
learning
to
escape
weariness
of
the
flesh
and
despair
of
the
spirit
knowledge
also
is
vanity
and
vexation
this
i
know
well
because
i
have
dwelt
among
men
and
held
converse
with
them
since
the
day
when
i
was
sent
to
instruct
the
first
man
in
eden
then
i
looked
more
closely
at
him
who
was
speaking
and
recognised
the
beauty
of
the
archangel
raphael
as
it
was
pictured
long
ago
a
seraph
winged
six
wings
he
wore
to
shade
his
lineaments
divine
the
pair
that
clad
each
shoulder
broad
came
mantling
his
breast
with
regal
ornament
the
middle
pair
girt
like
a
starry
zone
his
waist
and
round
skirted
his
loins
and
thighs
with
downy
gold
and
colours
dipped
in
the
third
his
feet
shadowed
from
either
heel
with
feathered
mail
grain
like
maia
son
he
stood
and
shook
his
plumes
that
heavenly
fragrance
filled
the
circuit
wide
too
well
i
know
he
spoke
on
while
the
smile
on
his
face
deepened
into
a
look
of
pity
and
tenderness
and
desire
too
well
i
know
that
power
corrupts
itself
and
that
knowledge
can
not
save
there
is
no
cure
for
the
evil
that
is
in
the
world
but
by
the
giving
of
more
love
to
men
the
laws
that
are
ordained
for
earth
are
strange
and
unequal
and
the
ways
where
men
must
walk
are
full
of
pitfalls
and
dangers
pestilence
creeps
along
the
ground
and
flows
in
the
rivers
whirlwind
and
tempest
shake
the
habitations
of
men
and
drive
their
ships
to
destruction
fire
breaks
forth
from
the
mountains
and
the
foundations
of
the
world
tremble
frail
is
the
flesh
of
man
and
many
are
his
pains
and
troubles
his
children
can
never
find
peace
until
they
learn
to
love
one
another
and
to
help
one
another
wickedness
is
begotten
by
disease
and
misery
violence
comes
from
poverty
and
hunger
the
cruelty
of
oppression
is
when
the
strong
tread
the
weak
under
their
feet
the
bitterness
of
pride
is
when
the
wise
and
learned
despise
the
simple
the
crown
of
folly
is
when
the
rich
think
they
are
gods
and
the
poor
think
that
god
is
not
hatred
and
envy
and
contempt
are
the
curse
of
life
and
for
these
there
is
no
remedy
save
love
the
will
to
give
and
to
bless
the
will
of
the
king
himself
who
gives
to
all
and
is
loving
unto
every
man
but
how
shall
the
hearts
of
men
be
won
to
this
will
how
shall
it
enter
into
them
and
possess
them
even
the
gods
that
men
fashion
for
themselves
are
cruel
and
proud
and
false
and
unjust
how
shall
the
miracle
be
wrought
in
human
nature
to
reveal
the
meaning
of
humanity
how
shall
men
be
made
like
god
at
this
question
a
deep
hush
fell
around
the
circle
and
every
listener
was
still
even
as
the
rustling
leaves
hang
motionless
when
the
light
breeze
falls
away
in
the
hour
of
sunset
then
through
the
silence
like
the
song
of
a
thrush
from
its
hermitage
in
the
forest
a
voice
came
ringing
i
know
it
i
know
it
i
know
it
clear
and
sweet
clear
as
a
ray
of
light
sweeter
than
the
smallest
silver
bell
that
rang
the
hour
of
rest
was
that
slender
voice
floating
on
the
odorous
and
translucent
air
nearer
and
nearer
it
came
echoing
down
the
valley
i
know
it
i
know
it
i
know
it
then
from
between
the
rounded
hills
among
which
the
brook
of
brighthopes
is
born
appeared
a
young
angel
a
little
child
with
flying
hair
of
gold
and
green
wreaths
twined
about
his
shoulders
and
fluttering
hands
that
played
upon
the
air
and
seemed
to
lift
him
so
lightly
that
he
had
no
need
of
wings
as
blown
by
the
wind
dances
across
the
water
so
he
came
along
the
little
stream
singing
clear
above
the
murmur
of
the
brook
all
the
angels
rose
and
turned
to
look
at
him
with
wondering
eyes
multitudes
of
others
came
flying
swiftly
to
the
place
from
which
the
strange
new
song
was
sounding
rank
within
rank
like
a
garden
of
living
flowers
they
stood
along
the
sloping
banks
of
the
brook
while
the
floated
into
the
midst
of
them
singing
i
know
it
i
know
it
i
know
it
man
shall
be
made
like
god
because
the
son
of
god
shall
become
a
man
at
this
all
the
angels
looked
at
one
another
with
amazement
and
gathered
more
closely
about
the
as
those
who
hear
wonderful
news
how
can
this
be
they
asked
how
is
it
possible
that
the
son
of
god
should
be
a
man
i
do
not
know
said
the
young
angel
i
only
know
that
it
is
to
be
but
if
he
becomes
a
man
said
raphael
he
will
be
at
the
mercy
of
men
the
cruel
and
the
wicked
will
have
power
upon
him
he
will
suffer
i
know
it
answered
the
young
angel
and
by
suffering
he
will
understand
the
meaning
of
all
sorrow
and
pain
and
he
will
be
able
to
comfort
every
one
who
cries
and
his
own
tears
will
be
for
the
healing
of
sad
hearts
and
those
who
are
healed
by
him
will
learn
for
his
sake
to
be
kind
to
each
other
but
if
the
son
of
god
is
a
true
man
said
uriel
he
must
first
be
a
child
simple
and
lowly
and
helpless
it
may
be
that
he
will
never
gain
the
learning
of
the
schools
the
masters
of
earthly
wisdom
will
despise
him
and
speak
scorn
of
him
i
know
it
said
the
young
angel
but
in
meekness
will
he
answer
them
and
to
those
who
become
as
little
children
he
will
give
the
heavenly
wisdom
that
comes
without
seeking
to
the
pure
and
gentle
of
heart
but
if
he
becomes
a
man
said
michael
evil
men
will
hate
and
persecute
him
they
may
even
take
his
life
if
they
are
stronger
than
he
i
know
it
answered
the
young
angel
they
will
nail
him
to
a
cross
but
when
he
is
lifted
up
he
will
draw
all
men
unto
him
for
he
will
still
be
the
son
of
god
and
no
heart
that
is
open
to
love
can
help
loving
him
since
his
love
for
men
is
so
great
that
he
is
willing
to
die
for
them
but
how
do
you
know
these
things
cried
the
other
angels
who
are
you
i
am
the
christmas
angel
he
said
at
first
i
was
sent
as
the
dream
of
a
little
child
a
holy
child
blessed
and
wonderful
to
dwell
in
the
heart
of
a
pure
virgin
mary
of
nazareth
there
i
was
hidden
till
the
word
came
to
call
me
back
to
the
throne
of
the
king
and
tell
me
my
name
and
give
me
my
new
message
for
this
is
christmas
day
on
earth
and
the
son
of
god
is
born
of
a
woman
so
i
must
fly
quickly
before
the
sun
rises
to
bring
the
good
news
to
those
happy
men
who
have
been
chosen
to
receive
them
as
he
said
this
the
young
angel
rose
with
arms
outspread
from
the
green
meadow
of
peacefield
and
passing
over
the
bounds
of
heaven
dropped
swiftly
as
a
toward
the
night
shadow
of
the
earth
the
other
angels
followed
him
a
throng
of
dazzling
forms
beautiful
as
a
rain
of
jewels
falling
from
the
sky
but
the
went
more
swiftly
than
the
others
because
of
the
certainty
of
gladness
in
his
heart
and
as
the
others
followed
him
they
wondered
who
had
been
favoured
and
chosen
to
receive
the
glad
tidings
it
must
be
the
emperor
of
the
world
and
his
counsellors
they
thought
but
the
flight
passed
over
rome
it
may
be
the
philosophers
and
the
masters
of
learning
they
thought
but
the
flight
passed
over
athens
can
it
be
the
high
priest
of
the
jews
and
the
elders
and
the
scribes
they
thought
but
the
flight
passed
over
jerusalem
it
floated
out
over
the
hill
country
of
bethlehem
the
throng
of
silent
angels
holding
close
together
as
if
perplexed
and
doubtful
the
darting
on
far
in
advance
as
one
who
knew
the
way
through
the
darkness
the
villages
were
all
still
the
very
houses
seemed
asleep
but
in
one
place
there
was
a
low
sound
of
talking
in
a
stable
near
to
an
inn
a
sound
as
of
a
mother
soothing
her
baby
to
rest
all
over
the
pastures
on
the
hillsides
a
light
film
of
snow
had
fallen
delicate
as
the
veil
of
a
bride
adorned
for
the
marriage
and
as
the
passed
over
them
alone
in
the
swiftness
of
his
flight
the
pure
fields
sparkled
round
him
giving
back
his
radiance
and
there
were
in
that
country
shepherds
abiding
in
the
fields
keeping
watch
over
their
flocks
by
night
and
lo
the
angel
of
the
lord
came
upon
them
and
the
glory
of
the
lord
shone
round
about
them
and
they
were
sore
afraid
and
the
angel
said
unto
them
fear
not
for
behold
i
bring
you
glad
tidings
of
great
joy
which
shall
be
to
all
nations
for
unto
you
is
born
this
day
in
the
city
of
david
a
saviour
which
is
christ
the
lord
and
this
shall
be
a
sign
unto
you
ye
shall
find
the
babe
wrapped
in
swaddling
clothes
lying
in
a
manger
and
suddenly
there
was
with
the
angel
a
multitude
of
the
heavenly
host
praising
god
and
saying
glory
to
god
in
the
highest
and
on
earth
peace
toward
men
and
the
shepherds
said
one
to
another
let
us
now
go
even
to
bethlehem
and
see
this
thing
which
is
come
to
pass
so
i
said
within
myself
that
i
also
would
go
with
the
shepherds
even
to
bethlehem
and
i
heard
a
great
and
sweet
voice
as
of
a
bell
which
said
come
and
when
the
bell
had
sounded
twelve
times
i
awoke
and
it
was
christmas
morn
and
i
knew
that
i
had
been
in
a
dream
yet
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
things
which
i
had
heard
were
true
a
little
essay
and
i
the
custom
of
exchanging
presents
on
a
certain
day
in
the
year
is
very
much
older
than
christmas
and
means
very
much
less
it
has
obtained
in
almost
all
ages
of
the
world
and
among
many
different
nations
it
is
a
fine
thing
or
a
foolish
thing
as
the
case
may
be
an
encouragement
to
friendliness
or
a
tribute
to
fashion
an
expression
of
good
nature
or
a
bid
for
favour
an
outgoing
of
generosity
or
a
disguise
of
greed
a
cheerful
old
custom
or
a
futile
old
farce
according
to
the
spirit
which
animates
it
and
the
form
which
it
takes
but
when
this
ancient
and
variously
interpreted
tradition
of
a
day
of
gifts
was
transferred
to
the
christmas
season
it
was
brought
into
vital
contact
with
an
idea
which
must
transform
it
and
with
an
example
which
must
lift
it
up
to
a
higher
plane
the
example
is
the
life
of
jesus
the
idea
is
unselfish
interest
in
the
happiness
of
others
the
great
gift
of
jesus
to
the
world
was
himself
he
lived
with
and
for
men
he
kept
back
nothing
in
every
particular
and
personal
gift
that
he
made
to
certain
people
there
was
something
of
himself
that
made
it
precious
for
example
at
the
wedding
in
cana
of
galilee
it
was
his
thought
for
the
feelings
of
the
giver
of
the
feast
and
his
wish
that
every
guest
should
find
due
entertainment
that
lent
the
flavour
of
a
heavenly
hospitality
to
the
wine
which
he
provided
when
he
gave
bread
and
fish
to
the
hungry
multitude
who
had
followed
him
out
among
the
hills
by
the
lake
of
gennesaret
the
people
were
refreshed
and
strengthened
by
the
sense
of
the
personal
care
of
jesus
for
their
welfare
as
much
as
by
the
food
which
he
bestowed
upon
them
it
was
another
illustration
of
the
sweetness
of
a
dinner
of
herbs
where
love
is
the
gifts
of
healing
which
he
conferred
upon
many
different
kinds
of
sufferers
were
in
every
case
evidences
that
jesus
was
willing
to
give
something
of
himself
his
thought
his
sympathy
his
vital
power
to
the
men
and
women
among
whom
he
lived
once
when
a
paralytic
was
brought
to
jesus
on
a
bed
he
surprised
everybody
and
offended
many
by
giving
the
poor
wretch
the
pardon
of
his
sins
before
he
gave
new
life
to
his
body
that
was
just
because
jesus
thought
before
he
gave
because
he
desired
to
satisfy
the
deepest
need
because
in
fact
he
gave
something
of
himself
in
every
gift
all
true
ought
to
be
after
this
pattern
not
that
it
must
all
be
solemn
and
serious
for
the
most
part
it
deals
with
little
wants
little
joys
little
tokens
of
friendly
feeling
but
the
feeling
must
be
more
than
the
token
else
the
gift
does
not
really
belong
to
christmas
it
takes
time
and
effort
and
unselfish
expenditure
of
strength
to
make
gifts
in
this
way
but
it
is
the
only
way
that
fits
the
season
the
finest
christmas
gift
is
not
the
one
that
costs
the
most
money
but
the
one
that
carries
the
most
love
ii
but
how
seldom
christmas
comes
only
once
a
year
and
how
soon
it
is
over
a
night
and
a
day
if
that
is
the
whole
of
it
it
seems
not
much
more
durable
than
the
little
toys
that
one
buys
of
a
fakir
on
the
they
run
for
an
hour
and
then
the
spring
breaks
and
the
legs
come
off
and
nothing
remains
but
a
contribution
to
the
dust
heap
but
surely
that
need
not
and
ought
not
to
be
the
whole
of
christmas
only
a
single
day
of
generosity
ransomed
from
the
dull
servitude
of
a
selfish
year
only
a
single
night
of
celebrated
in
the
of
a
selfish
race
if
every
gift
is
the
token
of
a
personal
thought
a
friendly
feeling
an
unselfish
interest
in
the
joy
of
others
then
the
thought
the
feeling
the
interest
may
remain
after
the
gift
is
made
the
little
present
or
the
rare
and
gift
it
matters
not
whether
the
vessel
be
of
gold
or
silver
or
iron
or
wood
or
clay
or
just
a
small
bit
of
birch
bark
folded
into
a
cup
may
carry
a
message
something
like
this
i
am
thinking
of
you
because
it
is
christmas
and
i
wish
you
happiness
and
because
it
will
be
the
day
after
christmas
i
shall
still
wish
you
happiness
and
so
on
clear
through
the
year
i
may
not
be
able
to
tell
you
about
it
every
day
because
i
may
be
far
away
or
because
both
of
us
may
be
very
busy
or
perhaps
because
i
can
not
even
afford
to
pay
the
postage
on
so
many
letters
or
find
the
time
to
write
them
but
that
makes
no
difference
the
thought
and
the
wish
will
be
here
just
the
same
in
my
work
and
in
the
business
of
life
i
mean
to
try
not
to
be
unfair
to
you
or
injure
you
in
any
way
in
my
pleasure
if
we
can
be
together
i
would
like
to
share
the
fun
with
you
whatever
joy
or
success
comes
to
you
will
make
me
glad
without
pretense
and
in
plain
words
to
you
is
what
i
mean
in
the
spirit
of
christmas
it
is
not
necessary
to
put
a
message
like
this
into
language
to
swear
absolute
devotion
and
deathless
consecration
in
love
and
friendship
small
steady
payments
on
a
gold
basis
are
better
than
immense
promissory
notes
nor
indeed
is
it
always
necessary
to
put
the
message
into
words
at
all
nor
even
to
convey
it
by
a
tangible
token
to
feel
it
and
to
act
it
out
that
is
the
main
thing
there
are
a
great
many
people
in
the
world
whom
we
know
more
or
less
but
to
whom
for
various
reasons
we
can
not
very
well
send
a
christmas
gift
but
there
is
hardly
one
in
all
the
circles
of
our
acquaintance
with
whom
we
may
not
exchange
the
touch
of
christmas
life
in
the
outer
circles
cheerful
greetings
courtesy
consideration
in
the
inner
circles
sympathetic
interest
hearty
congratulations
honest
encouragement
in
the
inmost
circle
comradeship
helpfulness
tenderness
friendship
tried
by
sun
and
wind
durable
from
the
daily
dust
of
after
all
is
the
best
kind
of
a
short
christmas
sermon
keeping
christmas
romans
xiv
that
regardeth
the
day
regardeth
it
unto
the
it
is
a
good
thing
to
observe
christmas
day
the
mere
marking
of
times
and
seasons
when
men
agree
to
stop
work
and
make
merry
together
is
a
wise
and
wholesome
custom
it
helps
one
to
feel
the
supremacy
of
the
common
life
over
the
individual
life
it
reminds
a
man
to
set
his
own
little
watch
now
and
then
by
the
great
clock
of
humanity
which
runs
on
sun
time
but
there
is
a
better
thing
than
the
observance
of
christmas
day
and
that
is
keeping
christmas
are
you
willing
to
forget
what
you
have
done
for
other
people
and
to
remember
what
other
people
have
done
for
you
to
ignore
what
the
world
owes
you
and
to
think
what
you
owe
the
world
to
put
your
rights
in
the
background
and
your
duties
in
the
middle
distance
and
your
chances
to
do
a
little
more
than
your
duty
in
the
foreground
to
see
that
your
are
just
as
real
as
you
are
and
try
to
look
behind
their
faces
to
their
hearts
hungry
for
joy
to
own
that
probably
the
only
good
reason
for
your
existence
is
not
what
you
are
going
to
get
out
of
life
but
what
you
are
going
to
give
to
life
to
close
your
book
of
complaints
against
the
management
of
the
universe
and
look
around
you
for
a
place
where
you
can
sow
a
few
seeds
of
happiness
are
you
willing
to
do
these
things
even
for
a
day
then
you
can
keep
christmas
are
you
willing
to
stoop
down
and
consider
the
needs
and
the
desires
of
little
children
to
remember
the
weakness
and
loneliness
of
people
who
are
growing
old
to
stop
asking
how
much
your
friends
love
you
and
ask
yourself
whether
you
love
them
enough
to
bear
in
mind
the
things
that
other
people
have
to
bear
on
their
hearts
to
try
to
understand
what
those
who
live
in
the
same
house
with
you
really
want
without
waiting
for
them
to
tell
you
to
trim
your
lamp
so
that
it
will
give
more
light
and
less
smoke
and
to
carry
it
in
front
so
that
your
shadow
will
fall
behind
you
to
make
a
grave
for
your
ugly
thoughts
and
a
garden
for
your
kindly
feelings
with
the
gate
open
are
you
willing
to
do
these
things
even
for
a
day
then
you
can
keep
christmas
are
you
willing
to
believe
that
love
is
the
strongest
thing
in
the
world
stronger
than
hate
stronger
than
evil
stronger
than
death
and
that
the
blessed
life
which
began
in
bethlehem
nineteen
hundred
years
ago
is
the
image
and
brightness
of
the
eternal
love
then
you
can
keep
christmas
and
if
you
keep
it
for
a
day
why
not
always
but
you
can
never
keep
it
alone
two
christmas
prayers
a
christmas
prayer
for
the
home

all
men

upon
our
family
kneeling
together
before

we
bless
thee
for
the
gift
of
thy
dear
son

the
peace

human
homes

the
he
teaches
to
sinful
men
for
the
glory
of
thy
goodness
shining
in
his
face
with
joyful
voice
we
praise
thee
for
his
lowly
birth
and
his
rest
in
the
manger
for
the
pure
tenderness
of
his
mother
mary
for
the
fatherly
care
that
protected
him
for
the
providence
that
saved
the
holy
child
to
be
the
saviour
of
the
world
with
deep
desire
we
beseech
thee

us
to
keep
his
birthday
truly
help
us
to
offer
in
his
name
our
christmas
prayer
from
the
sickness
of
sin
and
the
darkness
of
doubt
from
selfish
pleasures
and
sullen
pains
from
the
frost
of
pride
and
the
fever
of
envy
god
save
us
every
one
through
the
blessing
of
jesus
in
the
health
of
purity
and
the
calm
of
mutual
trust
in
the
sharing
of
joy
and
the
bearing
of
trouble
in
the
steady
glow
of
love
and
the
clear
light
of
hope
god
keep
us
every
one
by
the
blessing
of
jesus

praying
and
praising
in
giving
and
receiving

eating
and
drinking
in
singing
and
making
merry
in
parents

and
in
children

have
departed

with
the
blessing
of

remembering
our
kinship

the
downcast

a
christmas
prayer
for
lonely
folks
lord
god
of
the
solitary
look
upon
me
in
my
loneliness
since
i
may
not
keep
this
christmas
in
the
home
send
it
into
my
heart
let
not
my
sins
cloud
me
in
but
shine
through
them
with
forgiveness
in
the
face
of
the
child
jesus
put
me
in
loving
remembrance
of
the
lowly
lodging
in
the
stable
of
bethlehem
the
sorrows
of
the
blessed
mary
the
poverty
and
exile
of
the
prince
of
peace
for
his
sake
give
me
a
cheerful
courage
to
endure
my
lot
and
an
inward
comfort
to
sweeten
it
purge
my
heart
from
hard
and
bitter
thoughts
let
no
shadow
of
forgetting
come
between
me
and
friends
far
away
bless
them
in
their
christmas
mirth
hedge
me
in
with
faithfulness
that
i
may
not
grow
unworthy
to
meet
them
again
give
me
good
work
to
do
that
i
may
forget
myself
and
find
peace
in
doing
it
for
thee
though
i
am
poor
send
me
to
carry
some
gift
to
those
who
are
poorer
some
cheer
to
those
who
are
more
lonely
grant
me
the
joy
to
do
a
kindness
to
one
of
thy
little
ones
light
my
christmas
candle
at
the
gladness
of
an
innocent
and
grateful
heart
strange
is
the
path
where
thou
leadest
me
let
me
not
doubt
thy
wisdom
nor
lose
thy
hand
make
me
sure
that
eternal
love
is
revealed
in
jesus
thy
dear
son
to
save
us
from
sin
and
solitude
and
death
teach
me
that
i
am
not
alone
but
that
many
hearts
all
round
the
world
join
with
me
through
the
silence
while
i
pray
in
his
name
father
which
art
in
heaven
hallowed
be
thy
kingdom
come
thy
will
be
done
in
earth
as
it
is
in
us
this
day
our
daily
bread
and
forgive
us
our
debts
as
we
forgive
our
lead
us
not
into
temptation

deliver
us
from
evil
thine
is
the
kingdom
