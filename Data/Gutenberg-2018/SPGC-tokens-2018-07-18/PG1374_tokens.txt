vendetta
chapter
prologue
in
the
year
toward
the
close
of
october
a
foreigner
accompanied
by
a
woman
and
a
little
girl
was
standing
for
a
long
time
in
front
of
the
palace
of
the
tuileries
near
the
ruins
of
a
house
recently
pulled
down
at
the
point
where
in
our
day
the
wing
begins
which
was
intended
to
unite
the
chateau
of
catherine
de
medici
with
the
louvre
of
the
valois
the
man
stood
there
with
folded
arms
and
a
bowed
head
which
he
sometimes
raised
to
look
alternately
at
the
consular
palace
and
at
his
wife
who
was
sitting
near
him
on
a
stone
though
the
woman
seemed
wholly
occupied
with
the
little
girl
of
nine
or
ten
years
of
age
whose
long
black
hair
she
amused
herself
by
handling
she
lost
not
a
single
glance
of
those
her
companion
cast
on
her
some
sentiment
other
than
love
united
these
two
beings
and
inspired
with
mutual
anxiety
their
movements
and
their
thoughts
misery
is
perhaps
the
most
powerful
of
all
ties
the
stranger
had
one
of
those
broad
serious
heads
covered
with
thick
hair
which
we
see
so
frequently
in
the
pictures
of
the
caracci
the
jet
black
of
the
hair
was
streaked
with
white
though
noble
and
proud
his
features
had
a
hardness
which
spoiled
them
in
spite
of
his
evident
strength
and
his
straight
erect
figure
he
looked
to
be
over
sixty
years
of
age
his
dilapidated
clothes
were
those
of
a
foreign
country
though
the
faded
and
once
beautiful
face
of
the
wife
betrayed
the
deepest
sadness
she
forced
herself
to
smile
assuming
a
calm
countenance
whenever
her
husband
looked
at
her
the
little
girl
was
standing
though
signs
of
weariness
were
on
the
youthful
face
which
was
tanned
by
the
sun
she
had
an
italian
cast
of
countenance
and
bearing
large
black
eyes
beneath
their
well
arched
brows
a
native
nobleness
and
candid
grace
more
than
one
of
those
who
passed
them
felt
strongly
moved
by
the
mere
aspect
of
this
group
who
made
no
effort
to
conceal
a
despair
which
seemed
as
deep
as
the
expression
of
it
was
simple
but
the
flow
of
this
fugitive
sympathy
characteristic
of
parisians
was
dried
immediately
for
as
soon
as
the
stranger
saw
himself
the
object
of
attention
he
looked
at
his
observer
with
so
savage
an
air
that
the
boldest
lounger
hurried
his
step
as
though
he
had
trod
upon
a
serpent
after
standing
for
some
time
undecided
the
tall
stranger
suddenly
passed
his
hand
across
his
face
to
brush
away
as
it
were
the
thoughts
that
were
ploughing
furrows
in
it
he
must
have
taken
some
desperate
resolution
casting
a
glance
upon
his
wife
and
daughter
he
drew
a
dagger
from
his
breast
and
gave
it
to
his
companion
saying
in
italian
i
will
see
if
the
bonapartes
remember
then
he
walked
with
a
slow
determined
step
toward
the
entrance
of
the
palace
where
he
was
naturally
stopped
by
a
soldier
of
the
consular
guard
with
whom
he
was
not
permitted
a
long
discussion
seeing
this
man
s
obstinate
determination
the
sentinel
presented
his
bayonet
in
the
form
of
an
ultimatum
chance
willed
that
the
guard
was
changed
at
that
moment
and
the
corporal
very
obligingly
pointed
out
to
the
stranger
the
spot
where
the
commander
of
the
post
was
standing
let
bonaparte
know
that
bartolomeo
di
piombo
wishes
to
speak
with
him
said
the
italian
to
the
captain
on
duty
in
vain
the
officer
represented
to
bartolomeo
that
he
could
not
see
the
first
consul
without
having
previously
requested
an
audience
in
writing
the
italian
insisted
that
the
soldier
should
go
to
bonaparte
the
officer
stated
the
rules
of
the
post
and
refused
to
comply
with
the
order
of
this
singular
visitor
bartolomeo
frowned
heavily
casting
a
terrible
look
at
the
captain
as
if
he
made
him
responsible
for
the
misfortunes
that
this
refusal
might
occasion
then
he
kept
silence
folded
his
arms
tightly
across
his
breast
and
took
up
his
station
under
the
portico
which
serves
as
an
avenue
of
communication
between
the
garden
and
the
of
the
tuileries
persons
who
will
things
intensely
are
very
apt
to
be
helped
by
chance
at
the
moment
when
bartolomeo
di
piombo
seated
himself
on
one
of
the
stone
posts
which
was
near
the
entrance
a
carriage
drew
up
from
which
lucien
bonaparte
minister
of
the
interior
issued
ah
loucian
it
is
lucky
for
me
i
have
met
you
cried
the
stranger
these
words
said
in
the
corsican
patois
stopped
lucien
at
the
moment
when
he
was
springing
under
the
portico
he
looked
at
his
compatriot
and
recognized
him
at
the
first
word
that
bartolomeo
said
in
his
ear
he
took
the
corsican
away
with
him
murat
lannes
and
rapp
were
at
that
moment
in
the
cabinet
of
the
first
consul
as
lucien
entered
followed
by
a
man
so
singular
in
appearance
as
piombo
the
conversation
ceased
lucien
took
napoleon
by
the
arm
and
led
him
into
the
recess
of
a
window
after
exchanging
a
few
words
with
his
brother
the
first
consul
made
a
sign
with
his
hand
which
murat
and
lannes
obeyed
by
retiring
rapp
pretended
not
to
have
seen
it
in
order
to
remain
where
he
was
bonaparte
then
spoke
to
him
sharply
and
the
with
evident
unwillingness
left
the
room
the
first
consul
who
listened
for
rapp
s
step
in
the
adjoining
salon
opened
the
door
suddenly
and
found
his
close
to
the
wall
of
the
cabinet
do
you
choose
not
to
understand
me
said
the
first
consul
i
wish
to
be
alone
with
my
a
corsican
replied
the
i
distrust
those
fellows
too
much
to
the
first
consul
could
not
restrain
a
smile
as
he
pushed
his
faithful
officer
by
the
shoulders
well
what
has
brought
you
here
my
poor
bartolomeo
said
napoleon
to
ask
asylum
and
protection
from
you
if
you
are
a
true
corsican
replied
bartolomeo
roughly
what
ill
fortune
drove
you
from
the
island
you
were
the
richest
the
most
i
have
killed
all
the
portas
replied
the
corsican
in
a
deep
voice
frowning
heavily
the
first
consul
took
two
steps
backward
in
surprise
do
you
mean
to
betray
me
cried
bartolomeo
with
a
darkling
look
at
bonaparte
do
you
know
that
there
are
still
four
piombos
in
corsica
lucien
took
an
arm
of
his
compatriot
and
shook
it
did
you
come
here
to
threaten
the
savior
of
france
he
said
bonaparte
made
a
sign
to
lucien
who
kept
silence
then
he
looked
at
piombo
and
said
why
did
you
kill
the
portas
we
had
made
friends
replied
the
man
the
barbantis
reconciled
us
the
day
after
we
had
drunk
together
to
drown
our
quarrels
i
left
home
because
i
had
business
at
bastia
the
portas
remained
in
my
house
and
set
fire
to
my
vineyard
at
longone
they
killed
my
son
gregorio
my
daughter
ginevra
and
my
wife
having
taken
the
sacrament
that
morning
escaped
the
virgin
protected
them
when
i
returned
i
found
no
house
my
feet
were
in
its
ashes
as
i
searched
for
it
suddenly
they
struck
against
the
body
of
gregorio
i
recognized
him
in
the
moonlight
the
portas
have
dealt
me
this
blow
i
said
and
forthwith
i
went
to
the
woods
and
there
i
called
together
all
the
men
whom
i
had
ever
served
do
you
hear
me
bonaparte
and
we
marched
to
the
vineyard
of
the
portas
we
got
there
at
five
in
the
morning
at
seven
they
were
all
before
god
giacomo
declares
that
eliza
vanni
saved
a
child
luigi
but
i
myself
bound
him
to
his
bed
before
setting
fire
to
the
house
i
have
left
the
island
with
my
wife
and
child
without
being
able
to
discover
whether
indeed
luigi
porta
is
bonaparte
looked
with
curiosity
at
bartolomeo
but
without
surprise
how
many
were
there
asked
lucien
seven
replied
piombo
all
of
them
were
your
persecutors
in
the
olden
these
words
roused
no
expression
of
hatred
on
the
part
of
the
two
brothers
ha
you
are
no
longer
corsicans
cried
piombo
with
a
sort
of
despair
farewell
in
other
days
i
protected
you
he
added
in
a
reproachful
tone
without
me
your
mother
would
never
have
reached
marseille
he
said
addressing
himself
to
bonaparte
who
was
silent
and
thoughtful
his
elbow
resting
on
a
as
a
matter
of
duty
piombo
said
napoleon
at
last
i
can
not
take
you
under
my
wing
i
have
become
the
leader
of
a
great
nation
i
command
the
republic
i
am
bound
to
execute
the
ha
ha
said
bartolomeo
scornfully
but
i
can
shut
my
eyes
continued
bonaparte
the
tradition
of
the
vendetta
will
long
prevent
the
reign
of
law
in
corsica
he
added
as
if
speaking
to
himself
but
it
be
destroyed
at
any
bonaparte
was
silent
for
a
few
moments
and
lucien
made
a
sign
to
piombo
not
to
speak
the
corsican
was
swaying
his
head
from
right
to
left
in
deep
disapproval
live
here
in
paris
resumed
the
first
consul
addressing
bartolomeo
we
will
know
nothing
of
this
affair
i
will
cause
your
property
in
corsica
to
be
bought
to
give
you
enough
to
live
on
for
the
present
later
before
long
we
will
think
of
you
but
remember
no
more
vendetta
there
are
no
woods
here
to
fly
to
if
you
play
with
daggers
you
must
expect
no
mercy
here
the
law
protects
all
citizens
and
no
one
is
allowed
to
do
justice
for
he
has
made
himself
the
head
of
a
singular
nation
said
bartolomeo
taking
lucien
s
hand
and
pressing
it
but
you
have
both
recognized
me
in
misfortune
and
i
am
yours
henceforth
for
life
or
death
you
may
dispose
as
you
will
of
the
with
these
words
his
corsican
brow
unbent
and
he
looked
about
him
in
satisfaction
you
are
not
badly
off
here
he
said
smiling
as
if
he
meant
to
lodge
there
himself
you
are
all
in
red
like
a
your
success
depends
upon
yourself
you
can
have
a
palace
also
said
bonaparte
watching
his
compatriot
with
a
keen
eye
it
will
often
happen
that
i
shall
need
some
faithful
friend
in
whom
i
can
a
sigh
of
joy
heaved
the
vast
chest
of
the
corsican
who
held
out
his
hand
to
the
first
consul
saying
the
corsican
is
in
you
bonaparte
smiled
he
looked
in
silence
at
the
man
who
brought
as
it
were
a
waft
of
air
from
his
own
land
from
that
isle
where
he
had
been
so
miraculously
saved
from
the
hatred
of
the
english
party
the
land
he
was
never
to
see
again
he
made
a
sign
to
his
brother
who
then
took
piombo
away
lucien
inquired
with
interest
as
to
the
financial
condition
of
the
former
protector
of
their
family
piombo
took
him
to
a
window
and
showed
him
his
wife
and
ginevra
seated
on
a
heap
of
stones
we
came
from
fontainebleau
on
foot
we
have
not
a
single
penny
he
said
lucien
gave
his
purse
to
his
compatriot
telling
him
to
come
to
him
the
next
day
that
arrangements
might
be
made
to
secure
the
comfort
of
the
family
the
value
of
piombo
s
property
in
corsica
if
sold
would
scarcely
maintain
him
honorably
in
paris
fifteen
years
elapsed
between
the
time
of
piombo
s
arrival
with
his
family
in
paris
and
the
following
event
which
would
be
scarcely
intelligible
to
the
reader
without
this
narrative
of
the
foregoing
circumstances
chapter
ii
the
studio
servin
one
of
our
most
distinguished
artists
was
the
first
to
conceive
of
the
idea
of
opening
a
studio
for
young
girls
who
wished
to
take
lessons
in
painting
about
forty
years
of
age
a
man
of
the
purest
morals
entirely
given
up
to
his
art
he
had
married
from
inclination
the
dowerless
daughter
of
a
general
at
first
the
mothers
of
his
pupils
bought
their
daughters
themselves
to
the
studio
then
they
were
satisfied
to
send
them
alone
after
knowing
the
master
s
principles
and
the
pains
he
took
to
deserve
their
confidence
it
was
the
artist
s
intention
to
take
no
pupils
but
young
ladies
belonging
to
rich
families
of
good
position
in
order
to
meet
with
no
complaints
as
to
the
composition
of
his
classes
he
even
refused
to
take
girls
who
wished
to
become
artists
for
to
them
he
would
have
been
obliged
to
give
certain
instructions
without
which
no
talent
could
advance
in
the
profession
little
by
little
his
prudence
and
the
ability
with
which
he
initiated
his
pupils
into
his
art
the
certainty
each
mother
felt
that
her
daughter
was
in
company
with
none
but
young
girls
and
the
fact
of
the
artist
s
marriage
gave
him
an
excellent
reputation
as
a
teacher
in
society
when
a
young
girl
wished
to
learn
to
draw
and
her
mother
asked
advice
of
her
friends
the
answer
was
invariably
send
her
to
servin
servin
became
therefore
for
feminine
art
a
specialty
like
herbault
for
bonnets
leroy
for
gowns
and
chevet
for
eatables
it
was
recognized
that
a
young
woman
who
had
taken
lessons
from
servin
was
capable
of
judging
the
paintings
of
the
musee
conclusively
of
making
a
striking
portrait
copying
an
ancient
master
or
painting
a
genre
picture
the
artist
thus
sufficed
for
the
educational
needs
of
the
aristocracy
but
in
spite
of
these
relations
with
the
best
families
in
paris
he
was
independent
and
patriotic
and
he
maintained
among
them
that
easy
brilliant
tone
and
that
freedom
of
judgment
which
characterize
painters
he
had
carried
his
scrupulous
precaution
into
the
arrangements
of
the
locality
where
his
pupils
studied
the
entrance
to
the
attic
above
his
apartments
was
walled
up
to
reach
this
retreat
as
sacred
as
a
harem
it
was
necessary
to
go
up
a
small
spiral
staircase
made
within
his
own
rooms
the
studio
occupying
nearly
the
whole
attic
floor
under
the
roof
presented
to
the
eye
those
vast
proportions
which
surprise
inquirers
when
after
attaining
sixty
feet
above
the
they
expect
to
find
an
artist
squeezed
into
a
gutter
this
gallery
so
to
speak
was
profusely
lighted
from
above
through
enormous
panes
of
glass
furnished
with
those
green
linen
shades
by
means
of
which
all
artists
arrange
the
light
a
quantity
of
caricatures
heads
drawn
at
a
stroke
either
in
color
or
with
the
point
of
a
knife
on
walls
painted
in
a
dark
gray
proved
that
barring
a
difference
in
expression
the
most
distinguished
young
girls
have
as
much
fun
and
folly
in
their
minds
as
men
a
small
stove
with
a
large
pipe
which
described
a
fearful
zigzag
before
it
reached
the
upper
regions
of
the
roof
was
the
necessary
and
infallible
ornament
of
the
room
a
shelf
ran
round
the
walls
on
which
were
models
in
plaster
heterogeneously
placed
most
of
them
covered
with
gray
dust
here
and
there
above
this
shelf
a
head
of
niobe
hanging
to
a
nail
presented
her
pose
of
woe
a
venus
smiled
a
hand
thrust
itself
forward
like
that
of
a
pauper
asking
alms
a
few
ecorches
yellowed
by
smoke
looked
like
limbs
snatched
from
a
graveyard
besides
these
objects
pictures
drawings
lay
figures
frames
without
paintings
and
paintings
without
frames
gave
to
this
irregular
apartment
that
studio
physiognomy
which
is
distinguished
for
its
singular
jumble
of
ornament
and
bareness
poverty
and
riches
care
and
neglect
the
vast
receptacle
of
an
atelier
where
all
seems
small
even
man
has
something
of
the
air
of
an
opera
coulisse
here
lie
ancient
garments
gilded
armor
fragments
of
stuffs
machinery
and
yet
there
is
something
mysteriously
grand
like
thought
in
it
genius
and
death
are
there
diana
and
apollo
beside
a
skull
or
skeleton
beauty
and
destruction
poesy
and
reality
colors
glowing
in
the
shadows
often
a
whole
drama
motionless
and
silent
strange
symbol
of
an
artist
s
head
at
the
moment
when
this
history
begins
a
brilliant
july
sun
was
illuminating
the
studio
and
two
rays
striking
athwart
it
lengthwise
traced
diaphanous
gold
lines
in
which
the
dust
was
shimmering
a
dozen
easels
raised
their
sharp
points
like
masts
in
a
port
several
young
girls
were
animating
the
scene
by
the
variety
of
their
expressions
their
attitudes
and
the
differences
in
their
toilets
the
strong
shadows
cast
by
the
green
serge
curtains
arranged
according
to
the
needs
of
each
easel
produced
a
multitude
of
contrasts
and
the
piquant
effects
of
light
and
shade
this
group
was
the
prettiest
of
all
the
pictures
in
the
studio
a
fair
young
girl
very
simply
dressed
sat
at
some
distance
from
her
companions
working
bravely
and
seeming
to
be
in
dread
of
some
mishap
no
one
looked
at
her
or
spoke
to
her
she
was
much
the
prettiest
the
most
modest
and
apparently
the
least
rich
among
them
two
principal
groups
distinctly
separated
from
each
other
showed
the
presence
of
two
sets
or
cliques
two
minds
even
here
in
this
studio
where
one
might
suppose
that
rank
and
fortune
would
be
forgotten
but
however
that
might
be
these
young
girls
sitting
or
standing
in
the
midst
of
their
playing
with
their
brushes
or
preparing
them
handling
their
dazzling
palettes
painting
laughing
talking
singing
absolutely
natural
and
exhibiting
their
real
selves
composed
a
spectacle
unknown
to
man
one
of
them
proud
haughty
capricious
with
black
hair
and
beautiful
hands
was
casting
the
flame
of
her
glance
here
and
there
at
random
another
and
gay
a
smile
upon
her
lips
with
chestnut
hair
and
delicate
white
hands
was
a
typical
french
virgin
thoughtless
and
without
hidden
thoughts
living
her
natural
real
life
a
third
was
dreamy
melancholy
pale
bending
her
head
like
a
drooping
flower
her
neighbor
on
the
contrary
tall
indolent
with
asiatic
habits
long
eyes
moist
and
black
said
but
little
and
reflected
glancing
covertly
at
the
head
of
antinous
among
them
like
the
jocoso
of
a
spanish
play
full
of
wit
and
epigrammatic
sallies
another
girl
was
watching
the
rest
with
a
comprehensive
glance
making
them
laugh
and
tossing
up
her
head
too
lively
and
arch
not
to
be
pretty
she
appeared
to
rule
the
first
group
of
girls
who
were
the
daughters
of
bankers
notaries
and
merchants
all
rich
but
aware
of
the
imperceptible
though
cutting
slights
which
another
group
belonging
to
the
aristocracy
put
upon
them
the
latter
were
led
by
the
daughter
of
one
of
the
king
s
ushers
a
little
creature
as
silly
as
she
was
vain
proud
of
being
the
daughter
of
a
man
with
an
office
at
she
was
a
girl
who
always
pretended
to
understand
the
remarks
of
the
master
at
the
first
word
and
seemed
to
do
her
work
as
a
favor
to
him
she
used
an
eyeglass
came
very
much
dressed
and
always
late
and
entreated
her
companions
to
speak
low
in
this
second
group
were
several
girls
with
exquisite
figures
and
distinguished
features
but
there
was
little
in
their
glance
or
expression
that
was
simple
and
candid
though
their
attitudes
were
elegant
and
their
movements
graceful
their
faces
lacked
frankness
it
was
easy
to
see
that
they
belonged
to
a
world
where
polite
manners
form
the
character
from
early
youth
and
the
abuse
of
social
pleasures
destroys
sentiment
and
develops
egotism
but
when
the
whole
class
was
here
assembled
childlike
heads
were
seen
among
this
bevy
of
young
girls
ravishingly
pure
and
virgin
faces
with
lips
through
which
shone
spotless
teeth
and
on
which
a
virgin
smile
was
flickering
the
studio
then
resembled
not
a
studio
but
a
group
of
angels
seated
on
a
cloud
in
ether
by
on
this
occasion
servin
had
not
appeared
for
some
days
past
he
had
spent
most
of
his
time
in
a
studio
which
he
kept
elsewhere
where
he
was
giving
the
last
touches
to
a
picture
for
the
exposition
all
of
a
sudden
mademoiselle
amelie
thirion
the
leader
of
the
aristocrats
began
to
speak
in
a
low
voice
and
very
earnestly
to
her
neighbor
a
great
silence
fell
on
the
group
of
patricians
and
the
commercial
party
surprised
were
equally
silent
trying
to
discover
the
subject
of
this
earnest
conference
the
secret
of
the
young
was
soon
revealed
amelie
rose
took
an
easel
which
stood
near
hers
carried
it
to
a
distance
from
the
noble
group
and
placed
it
close
to
a
board
partition
which
separated
the
studio
from
the
extreme
end
of
the
attic
where
all
broken
casts
defaced
canvases
and
the
winter
supply
of
wood
were
kept
amelie
s
action
caused
a
murmur
of
surprise
which
did
not
prevent
her
from
accomplishing
the
change
by
rolling
hastily
to
the
side
of
the
easel
the
stool
the
box
of
colors
and
even
the
picture
by
prudhon
which
the
absent
pupil
was
copying
after
this
coup
d
etat
the
right
began
to
work
in
silence
but
the
left
discoursed
at
length
what
will
mademoiselle
piombo
say
to
that
asked
a
young
girl
of
mademoiselle
matilde
roguin
the
lively
oracle
of
the
banking
group
she
s
not
a
girl
to
say
anything
was
the
reply
but
fifty
years
hence
she
ll
remember
the
insult
as
if
it
were
done
to
her
the
night
before
and
revenge
it
cruelly
she
is
a
person
that
i
for
one
don
t
want
to
be
at
war
the
slight
these
young
ladies
mean
to
put
upon
her
is
all
the
more
unkind
said
another
young
girl
because
yesterday
mademoiselle
ginevra
was
very
sad
her
father
they
say
has
just
resigned
they
ought
not
to
add
to
her
trouble
for
she
was
very
considerate
of
them
during
the
hundred
days
never
did
she
say
a
word
to
wound
them
on
the
contrary
she
avoided
politics
but
i
think
our
are
acting
more
from
jealousy
than
from
party
i
have
a
great
mind
to
go
and
get
mademoiselle
piombo
s
easel
and
place
it
next
to
mine
said
matilde
roguin
she
rose
but
second
thoughts
made
her
sit
down
again
with
a
character
like
hers
she
said
one
can
t
tell
how
she
would
take
a
civility
better
wait
ecco
la
said
the
young
girl
with
the
black
eyes
languidly
the
steps
of
a
person
coming
up
the
narrow
stairway
sounded
through
the
studio
the
words
here
she
comes
passed
from
mouth
to
mouth
and
then
the
most
absolute
silence
reigned
to
understand
the
importance
of
the
ostracism
imposed
by
the
act
of
amelie
thirion
it
is
necessary
to
add
that
this
scene
took
place
toward
the
end
of
the
month
of
july
the
second
return
of
the
bourbons
had
shaken
many
friendships
which
had
held
firm
under
the
first
restoration
at
this
moment
families
almost
all
divided
in
opinion
were
renewing
many
of
the
deplorable
scenes
which
stain
the
history
of
all
countries
in
times
of
civil
or
religious
wars
children
young
girls
old
men
shared
the
monarchial
fever
to
which
the
country
was
then
a
victim
discord
glided
beneath
all
roofs
distrust
dyed
with
its
gloomy
colors
the
words
and
the
actions
of
the
most
intimate
friends
ginevra
piombo
loved
napoleon
to
idolatry
how
then
could
she
hate
him
the
emperor
was
her
compatriot
and
the
benefactor
of
her
father
the
baron
di
piombo
was
among
those
of
napoleon
s
devoted
servants
who
had
most
effectually
in
the
return
from
elba
incapable
of
denying
his
political
faith
anxious
even
to
confess
it
the
old
baron
remained
in
paris
in
the
midst
of
his
enemies
ginevra
piombo
was
all
the
more
open
to
condemnation
because
she
made
no
secret
of
the
grief
which
the
second
restoration
caused
to
her
family
the
only
tears
she
had
so
far
shed
in
life
were
drawn
from
her
by
the
twofold
news
of
napoleon
s
captivity
on
the
bellerophon
and
labedoyere
s
arrest
the
girls
of
the
aristocratic
group
of
pupils
belonged
to
the
most
devoted
royalist
families
in
paris
it
would
be
difficult
to
give
an
idea
of
the
exaggerations
prevalent
at
this
epoch
and
of
the
horror
inspired
by
the
bonapartists
however
insignificant
and
petty
amelie
s
action
may
now
seem
to
be
it
was
at
that
time
a
very
natural
expression
of
the
prevailing
hatred
ginevra
piombo
one
of
servin
s
first
pupils
had
occupied
the
place
that
was
now
taken
from
her
since
the
first
day
of
her
coming
to
the
studio
the
aristocratic
circle
had
gradually
surrounded
her
to
drive
her
from
a
place
that
in
some
sense
belonged
to
her
was
not
only
to
insult
her
but
to
cause
her
a
species
of
artistic
pain
for
all
artists
have
a
spot
of
predilection
where
they
work
nevertheless
political
prejudice
was
not
the
chief
influence
on
the
conduct
of
the
right
clique
of
the
studio
ginevra
much
the
ablest
of
servin
s
pupils
was
an
object
of
intense
jealousy
the
master
testified
as
much
admiration
for
the
talents
as
for
the
character
of
his
favorite
pupil
who
served
as
a
conclusion
to
all
his
comparisons
in
fact
without
any
one
being
able
to
explain
the
ascendancy
which
this
young
girl
obtained
over
all
who
came
in
contact
with
her
she
exercised
over
the
little
world
around
her
a
prestige
not
unlike
that
of
bonaparte
upon
his
soldiers
the
aristocracy
of
the
studio
had
for
some
days
past
resolved
upon
the
fall
of
this
queen
but
no
one
had
as
yet
ventured
to
openly
avoid
the
bonapartist
mademoiselle
thirion
s
act
was
therefore
a
decisive
stroke
intended
by
her
to
force
the
others
into
becoming
openly
the
accomplices
of
her
hatred
though
ginevra
was
sincerely
loved
by
several
of
these
royalists
nearly
all
of
whom
were
indoctrinated
at
home
with
their
political
ideas
they
decided
with
the
tactics
peculiar
to
women
that
they
should
do
best
to
keep
themselves
aloof
from
the
quarrel
on
ginevra
s
arrival
she
was
received
as
we
have
said
in
profound
silence
of
all
the
young
women
who
had
so
far
come
to
servin
s
studio
she
was
the
handsomest
the
tallest
and
the
best
made
her
carriage
and
demeanor
had
a
character
of
nobility
and
grace
which
commanded
respect
her
face
instinct
with
intelligence
seemed
to
radiate
light
so
inspired
was
it
with
the
enthusiasm
peculiar
to
corsicans
which
does
not
however
preclude
calmness
her
long
hair
and
her
black
eyes
and
lashes
expressed
passion
the
corners
of
her
mouth
too
softly
defined
and
the
lips
a
trifle
too
marked
gave
signs
of
that
kindliness
which
strong
beings
derive
from
the
consciousness
of
their
strength
by
a
singular
caprice
of
nature
the
charm
of
her
face
was
in
some
degree
contradicted
by
a
marble
forehead
on
which
lay
an
almost
savage
pride
and
from
which
seemed
to
emanate
the
moral
instincts
of
a
corsican
in
that
was
the
only
link
between
herself
and
her
native
land
all
the
rest
of
her
person
her
simplicity
the
easy
grace
of
her
lombard
beauty
was
so
seductive
that
it
was
difficult
for
those
who
looked
at
her
to
give
her
pain
she
inspired
such
keen
attraction
that
her
old
father
caused
her
as
matter
of
precaution
to
be
accompanied
to
and
from
the
studio
the
only
defect
of
this
truly
poetic
creature
came
from
the
very
power
of
a
beauty
so
fully
developed
she
looked
a
woman
marriage
she
had
refused
out
of
love
to
her
father
and
mother
feeling
herself
necessary
to
the
comfort
of
their
old
age
her
taste
for
painting
took
the
place
of
the
passions
and
interests
which
usually
absorb
her
sex
you
are
very
silent
mesdemoiselles
she
said
after
advancing
a
little
way
among
her
companions
my
little
laure
she
added
in
a
soft
caressing
voice
approaching
the
young
girl
who
was
painting
apart
from
the
rest
that
head
is
strong
the
flesh
tints
a
little
too
rosy
but
the
drawing
is
laure
raised
her
head
and
looked
tenderly
at
ginevra
their
faces
beamed
with
the
expression
of
a
mutual
affection
a
faint
smile
brightened
the
lips
of
the
young
italian
who
seemed
thoughtful
and
walked
slowly
to
her
easel
glancing
carelessly
at
the
drawings
and
paintings
on
her
way
and
bidding
to
each
of
the
young
girls
of
the
first
group
not
observing
the
unusual
curiosity
excited
by
her
presence
she
was
like
a
queen
in
the
midst
of
her
court
she
paid
no
attention
to
the
profound
silence
that
reigned
among
the
patricians
and
passed
before
their
camp
without
pronouncing
a
single
word
her
absorption
seemed
so
great
that
she
sat
down
before
her
easel
opened
her
took
up
her
brushes
drew
on
her
brown
sleeves
arranged
her
apron
looked
at
her
picture
examined
her
palette
without
apparently
thinking
of
what
she
was
doing
all
heads
in
the
group
of
the
bourgeoises
were
turned
toward
her
if
the
young
ladies
in
the
thirion
camp
did
not
show
their
impatience
with
the
same
frankness
their
sidelong
glances
were
none
the
less
directed
on
ginevra
she
hasn
t
noticed
it
said
mademoiselle
roguin
at
this
instant
ginevra
abandoned
the
meditative
attitude
in
which
she
had
been
contemplating
her
canvas
and
turned
her
head
toward
the
group
of
aristocrats
she
measured
at
a
glance
the
distance
that
now
separated
her
from
them
but
she
said
nothing
it
hasn
t
occurred
to
her
that
they
meant
to
insult
her
said
matilde
she
neither
colored
nor
turned
pale
how
vexed
these
girls
will
be
if
she
likes
her
new
place
as
well
as
the
old
you
are
out
of
bounds
mademoiselle
she
added
aloud
addressing
ginevra
the
italian
pretended
not
to
hear
perhaps
she
really
did
not
hear
she
rose
abruptly
walked
with
a
certain
deliberation
along
the
side
of
the
partition
which
separated
the
adjoining
closet
from
the
studio
and
seemed
to
be
examining
the
sash
through
which
her
light
came
giving
so
much
importance
to
it
that
she
mounted
a
chair
to
raise
the
green
serge
which
intercepted
the
light
much
higher
reaching
that
height
her
eye
was
on
a
level
with
a
slight
opening
in
the
partition
the
real
object
of
her
efforts
for
the
glance
that
she
cast
through
it
can
be
compared
only
to
that
of
a
miser
discovering
aladdin
s
treasure
then
she
sprang
down
hastily
and
returned
to
her
place
changed
the
position
of
her
picture
pretended
to
be
still
dissatisfied
with
the
light
pushed
a
table
close
to
the
partition
on
which
she
placed
a
chair
climbed
lightly
to
the
summit
of
this
erection
and
again
looked
through
the
crevice
she
cast
but
one
glance
into
the
space
beyond
which
was
lighted
through
a
skylight
but
what
she
saw
produced
so
strong
an
effect
upon
her
that
she
tottered
take
care
mademoiselle
ginevra
you
ll
fall
cried
laure
all
the
young
girls
gazed
at
the
imprudent
climber
and
the
fear
of
their
coming
to
her
gave
her
courage
she
recovered
her
equilibrium
and
replied
as
she
balanced
herself
on
the
shaking
chair
pooh
it
is
more
solid
than
a
throne
she
then
secured
the
curtain
and
came
down
pushed
the
chair
and
table
as
far
as
possible
from
the
partition
returned
to
her
easel
and
seemed
to
be
arranging
it
to
suit
the
volume
of
light
she
had
now
thrown
upon
it
her
picture
however
was
not
in
her
mind
which
was
wholly
bent
on
getting
as
near
as
possible
to
the
closet
against
the
door
of
which
she
finally
settled
herself
then
she
began
to
prepare
her
palette
in
the
deepest
silence
sitting
there
she
could
hear
distinctly
a
sound
which
had
strongly
excited
her
curiosity
the
evening
before
and
had
whirled
her
young
imagination
across
vast
fields
of
conjecture
she
recognized
the
firm
and
regular
breathing
of
a
man
whom
she
had
just
seen
asleep
her
curiosity
was
satisfied
beyond
her
expectations
but
at
the
same
time
she
felt
saddled
by
an
immense
responsibility
through
the
opening
in
the
wall
she
had
seen
the
imperial
eagle
and
upon
the
flock
bed
faintly
lighted
from
above
lay
the
form
of
an
officer
of
the
guard
she
guessed
all
servin
was
hiding
a
proscribed
man
she
now
trembled
lest
any
of
her
companions
should
come
near
here
to
examine
her
picture
when
the
regular
breathing
or
some
deeper
breath
might
reveal
to
them
as
it
had
to
her
the
presence
of
this
political
victim
she
resolved
to
keep
her
place
beside
that
door
trusting
to
her
wits
to
baffle
all
dangerous
chances
that
might
arise
better
that
i
should
be
here
thought
she
to
prevent
some
luckless
accident
than
leave
that
poor
man
at
the
mercy
of
a
heedless
this
was
the
secret
of
the
indifference
which
ginevra
had
apparently
shown
to
the
removal
of
her
easel
she
was
inwardly
enchanted
because
the
change
had
enabled
her
to
gratify
her
curiosity
in
a
natural
manner
besides
at
this
moment
she
was
too
keenly
preoccupied
to
perceive
the
reason
of
her
removal
nothing
is
more
mortifying
to
young
girls
or
indeed
to
all
the
world
than
to
see
a
piece
of
mischief
an
insult
or
a
biting
speech
miss
its
effect
through
the
contempt
or
the
indifference
of
the
intended
victim
it
seems
as
if
hatred
to
an
enemy
grows
in
proportion
to
the
height
that
enemy
is
raised
above
us
ginevra
s
behavior
was
an
enigma
to
all
her
companions
her
friends
and
enemies
were
equally
surprised
for
the
former
claimed
for
her
all
good
qualities
except
that
of
forgiveness
of
injuries
though
of
course
the
occasions
for
displaying
that
vice
of
nature
were
seldom
afforded
to
ginevra
in
the
life
of
a
studio
still
the
specimens
she
had
now
and
then
given
of
her
vindictive
disposition
had
left
a
strong
impression
on
the
minds
of
her
companions
after
many
conjectures
mademoiselle
roguin
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
italian
s
silence
showed
a
grandeur
of
soul
beyond
all
praise
and
the
banking
circle
inspired
by
her
formed
a
project
to
humiliate
the
aristocracy
they
succeeded
in
that
aim
by
a
fire
of
sarcasms
which
presently
brought
down
the
pride
of
the
right
coterie
madame
servin
s
arrival
put
a
stop
to
the
struggle
with
the
shrewdness
that
usually
accompanies
malice
amelie
thirion
had
noticed
analyzed
and
mentally
commented
on
the
extreme
preoccupation
of
ginevra
s
mind
which
prevented
her
from
even
hearing
the
bitterly
polite
war
of
words
of
which
she
was
the
object
the
vengeance
mademoiselle
roguin
and
her
companions
were
inflicting
on
mademoiselle
thirion
and
her
group
had
therefore
the
fatal
effect
of
driving
the
young
to
search
for
the
cause
of
the
silence
so
obstinately
maintained
by
ginevra
di
piombo
the
beautiful
italian
became
the
centre
of
all
glances
and
she
was
henceforth
watched
by
friends
and
foes
alike
it
is
very
difficult
to
hide
even
a
slight
emotion
or
sentiment
from
fifteen
inquisitive
and
unoccupied
young
girls
whose
wits
and
mischief
ask
for
nothing
better
than
secrets
to
guess
schemes
to
create
or
baffle
and
who
know
how
to
find
too
many
interpretations
for
each
gesture
glance
and
word
to
fail
in
discovering
the
right
one
at
this
moment
however
the
presence
of
madame
servin
produced
an
interlude
in
the
drama
thus
played
below
the
surface
in
these
various
young
hearts
the
sentiments
ideas
and
progress
of
which
were
expressed
by
phrases
that
were
almost
allegorical
by
mischievous
glances
by
gestures
by
silence
even
more
intelligible
than
words
as
soon
as
madame
servin
entered
the
studio
her
eyes
turned
to
the
door
near
which
ginevra
was
seated
under
present
circumstances
the
fact
of
this
glance
was
not
lost
though
at
first
none
of
the
pupils
took
notice
of
it
mademoiselle
thirion
recollected
it
later
and
it
explained
to
her
the
doubt
fear
and
mystery
which
now
gave
something
wild
and
frightened
to
madame
servin
s
eyes
mesdemoiselles
she
said
monsieur
servin
can
not
come
then
she
went
round
complimenting
each
young
girl
receiving
in
return
a
volume
of
those
feminine
caresses
which
are
given
as
much
by
the
tones
of
the
voice
and
by
looks
as
by
gestures
she
presently
reached
ginevra
under
the
influence
of
an
uneasiness
she
tried
in
vain
to
disguise
they
nodded
to
each
other
in
a
friendly
way
but
said
nothing
one
painted
the
other
stood
looking
at
the
painting
the
breathing
of
the
soldier
in
the
closet
could
be
distinctly
heard
but
madame
servin
appeared
not
to
notice
it
her
feigned
ignorance
was
so
obvious
that
ginevra
recognized
it
at
once
for
wilful
deafness
presently
the
unknown
man
turned
on
his
pallet
the
italian
then
looked
fixedly
at
madame
servin
who
said
without
the
slightest
change
of
face
your
copy
is
as
fine
as
the
original
if
i
had
to
choose
between
the
two
i
should
be
monsieur
servin
has
not
taken
his
wife
into
his
confidence
as
to
this
mystery
thought
ginevra
who
after
replying
to
the
young
wife
s
speech
with
a
gentle
smile
of
incredulity
began
to
hum
a
corsican
canzonetta
to
cover
the
noise
that
was
made
by
the
prisoner
it
was
so
unusual
a
thing
to
hear
the
studious
italian
sing
that
all
the
other
young
girls
looked
up
at
her
in
surprise
later
this
circumstance
served
as
proof
to
the
charitable
suppositions
of
jealousy
madame
servin
soon
went
away
and
the
session
ended
without
further
events
ginevra
allowed
her
companions
to
depart
and
seemed
to
intend
to
work
later
but
unconsciously
to
herself
she
betrayed
her
desire
to
be
left
alone
by
impatient
glances
at
the
pupils
who
were
slow
in
leaving
mademoiselle
thirion
a
cruel
enemy
to
the
girl
who
excelled
her
in
everything
guessed
by
the
instinct
of
jealousy
that
her
rival
s
industry
hid
some
purpose
by
dint
of
watching
her
she
was
struck
by
the
attentive
air
with
which
ginevra
seemed
to
be
listening
to
sounds
that
no
one
else
had
heard
the
expression
of
impatience
she
now
detected
in
her
companion
s
eyes
was
like
a
flash
of
light
to
her
amelie
was
the
last
of
the
pupils
to
leave
the
studio
from
there
she
went
down
to
madame
servin
s
apartment
and
talked
with
her
for
a
moment
then
she
pretended
to
have
left
her
bag
ran
softly
back
to
the
studio
and
found
ginevra
once
more
mounted
on
her
frail
scaffolding
and
so
absorbed
in
the
contemplation
of
an
unknown
object
that
she
did
not
hear
the
slight
noise
of
her
companion
s
footsteps
it
is
true
that
to
use
an
expression
of
walter
scott
amelie
stepped
as
if
on
eggs
she
hastily
withdrew
outside
the
door
and
coughed
ginevra
quivered
turned
her
head
saw
her
enemy
blushed
hastened
to
alter
the
shade
to
give
meaning
to
her
position
and
came
down
from
her
perch
leisurely
she
soon
after
left
the
studio
bearing
with
her
in
her
memory
the
image
of
a
man
s
head
as
beauteous
as
that
of
the
endymion
a
masterpiece
of
girodet
s
which
she
had
lately
copied
to
banish
so
young
a
man
who
can
he
be
for
he
is
not
marshal
ney
these
two
sentences
are
the
simplest
expression
of
the
many
ideas
that
ginevra
turned
over
in
her
mind
for
two
days
on
the
third
day
in
spite
of
her
haste
to
be
first
at
the
studio
she
found
mademoiselle
thirion
already
there
having
come
in
a
carriage
ginevra
and
her
enemy
observed
each
other
for
a
long
time
but
they
made
their
faces
impenetrable
amelie
had
seen
the
handsome
head
of
the
mysterious
man
but
fortunately
and
unfortunately
also
the
imperial
eagles
and
uniform
were
so
placed
that
she
did
not
see
them
through
the
crevice
in
the
partition
she
was
lost
in
conjectures
suddenly
servin
came
in
much
earlier
than
usual
mademoiselle
ginevra
he
said
after
glancing
round
the
studio
why
have
you
placed
yourself
there
the
light
is
bad
come
nearer
to
the
rest
of
the
young
ladies
and
pull
down
that
curtain
a
then
he
sat
down
near
laure
whose
work
deserved
his
most
cordial
attention
well
well
he
cried
here
indeed
is
a
head
extremely
well
done
you
ll
be
another
the
master
then
went
from
easel
to
easel
scolding
flattering
jesting
and
making
as
usual
his
jests
more
dreaded
than
his
reprimands
ginevra
had
not
obeyed
the
professor
s
order
but
remained
at
her
post
firmly
resolved
not
to
quit
it
she
took
a
sheet
of
paper
and
began
to
sketch
in
sepia
the
head
of
the
hidden
man
a
work
done
under
the
impulse
of
an
emotion
has
always
a
stamp
of
its
own
the
faculty
of
giving
to
representations
of
nature
or
of
thought
their
true
coloring
constitutes
genius
and
often
in
this
respect
passion
takes
the
place
of
it
so
under
the
circumstances
in
which
ginevra
now
found
herself
the
intuition
which
she
owed
to
a
powerful
effect
upon
her
memory
or
possibly
to
necessity
that
mother
of
great
things
lent
her
for
the
moment
a
supernatural
talent
the
head
of
the
young
officer
was
dashed
upon
the
paper
in
the
midst
of
an
awkward
trembling
which
she
mistook
for
fear
and
in
which
a
physiologist
would
have
recognized
the
fire
of
inspiration
from
time
to
time
she
glanced
furtively
at
her
companions
in
order
to
hide
the
sketch
if
any
of
them
came
near
her
but
in
spite
of
her
watchfulness
there
was
a
moment
when
she
did
not
see
the
eyeglass
of
the
pitiless
amelie
turned
full
upon
the
drawing
from
the
shelter
of
a
great
portfolio
mademoiselle
thirion
recognizing
the
portrait
of
the
mysterious
man
showed
herself
abruptly
and
ginevra
hastily
covered
the
sheet
of
paper
why
do
you
stay
there
in
spite
of
my
advice
mademoiselle
asked
the
professor
gravely
the
pupil
turned
her
easel
so
that
no
one
but
the
master
could
see
the
sketch
which
she
placed
upon
it
and
said
in
an
agitated
voice
do
you
not
think
as
i
do
that
the
light
is
very
good
had
i
not
better
remain
here
servin
turned
pale
as
nothing
escapes
the
piercing
eyes
of
malice
mademoiselle
thirion
became
as
it
were
a
sharer
in
the
sudden
emotion
of
master
and
pupil
you
are
right
said
servin
but
really
he
added
with
a
forced
laugh
you
will
soon
come
to
know
more
than
i
a
pause
followed
during
which
the
professor
studied
the
drawing
of
the
officer
s
head
it
is
a
masterpiece
worthy
of
salvator
rosa
he
exclaimed
with
the
energy
of
an
artist
all
the
pupils
rose
on
hearing
this
and
mademoiselle
thirion
darted
forward
with
the
velocity
of
a
tiger
on
its
prey
at
this
instant
the
prisoner
awakened
perhaps
by
the
noise
began
to
move
ginevra
knocked
over
her
stool
said
a
few
incoherent
sentences
and
began
to
laugh
but
she
had
thrown
the
portrait
into
her
portfolio
before
amelie
could
get
to
her
the
easel
was
now
surrounded
servin
descanted
on
the
beauty
of
the
copy
which
his
favorite
pupil
was
then
making
and
the
whole
class
was
duped
by
this
stratagem
except
amelie
who
slipping
behind
her
companions
attempted
to
open
the
portfolio
where
she
had
seen
ginevra
throw
the
sketch
but
the
latter
took
it
up
without
a
word
and
placed
it
in
front
of
her
the
two
young
girls
then
looked
at
each
other
fixedly
in
silence
come
mesdemoiselles
take
your
places
said
servin
if
you
wish
to
do
as
well
as
mademoiselle
di
piombo
you
mustn
t
be
always
talking
fashions
and
balls
and
trifling
away
your
time
as
you
when
they
were
all
reseated
before
their
easels
servin
sat
down
beside
ginevra
was
it
not
better
that
i
should
be
the
one
to
discover
the
mystery
rather
than
the
others
asked
the
girl
in
a
low
voice
yes
replied
the
painter
you
are
one
of
us
a
patriot
but
even
if
you
were
not
i
should
still
have
confided
the
matter
to
master
and
pupil
understood
each
other
and
ginevra
no
longer
feared
to
ask
who
is
he
an
intimate
friend
of
labedoyere
who
contributed
more
than
any
other
man
except
the
unfortunate
colonel
to
the
union
of
the
regiment
with
the
grenadiers
of
elba
he
was
a
major
in
the
imperial
guard
and
was
at
why
not
have
burned
his
uniform
and
shako
and
supplied
him
with
citizen
s
clothes
said
ginevra
impatiently
he
will
have
them
you
ought
to
have
closed
the
studio
for
some
he
is
going
then
they
ll
kill
him
said
the
girl
let
him
stay
here
with
you
till
the
present
storm
is
over
paris
is
still
the
only
place
in
france
where
a
man
can
be
hidden
safely
is
he
a
friend
of
yours
she
asked
no
he
has
no
claim
upon
me
but
that
of
his
he
came
into
my
hands
in
this
way
my
who
returned
to
the
army
during
the
campaign
met
this
young
fellow
and
very
cleverly
rescued
him
from
the
claws
of
those
who
captured
labedoyere
he
came
here
to
defend
the
general
foolish
fellow
do
you
call
him
that
cried
ginevra
casting
a
glance
of
astonishment
at
the
painter
who
was
silent
for
a
moment
my
is
too
closely
watched
to
be
able
to
keep
him
in
his
own
house
he
resumed
so
he
brought
him
to
me
by
night
about
a
week
ago
i
hoped
to
keep
him
out
of
sight
in
this
corner
the
only
spot
in
the
house
where
he
could
be
if
i
can
be
useful
to
you
employ
me
said
ginevra
i
know
the
marechal
de
well
we
ll
see
replied
the
painter
this
conversation
lasted
too
long
not
to
be
noticed
by
all
the
other
girls
servin
left
ginevra
went
round
once
more
to
each
easel
and
gave
such
long
lessons
that
he
was
still
there
at
the
hour
when
the
pupils
were
in
the
habit
of
leaving
you
are
forgetting
your
bag
mademoiselle
thirion
said
the
professor
running
after
the
girl
who
was
now
condescending
to
the
work
of
a
spy
to
satisfy
her
jealousy
the
baffled
pupil
returned
for
the
bag
expressing
surprise
at
her
carelessness
but
this
act
of
servin
s
was
to
her
fresh
proof
of
the
existence
of
a
mystery
the
importance
of
which
was
evident
she
now
ran
noisily
down
the
staircase
and
slammed
the
door
which
opened
into
the
servins
apartment
to
give
an
impression
that
she
had
gone
then
she
softly
returned
and
stationed
herself
outside
the
door
of
the
studio
chapter
iii
labedoyere
s
friend
when
the
painter
and
ginevra
thought
themselves
alone
servin
rapped
in
a
peculiar
manner
on
the
door
of
the
dark
garret
which
turned
at
once
on
its
rusty
and
creaking
hinges
ginevra
then
saw
a
tall
and
young
man
whose
imperial
uniform
set
her
heart
to
beating
the
officer
had
one
arm
in
a
sling
and
the
pallor
of
his
face
revealed
sharp
suffering
seeing
an
unknown
woman
he
recoiled
amelie
who
was
unable
to
look
into
the
room
the
door
being
closed
was
afraid
to
stay
longer
she
was
satisfied
with
having
heard
the
opening
of
the
garret
door
and
departed
noiselessly
fear
nothing
said
the
painter
to
the
officer
mademoiselle
is
the
daughter
of
a
most
faithful
friend
of
the
emperor
the
baron
di
the
young
soldier
retained
no
doubts
as
to
ginevra
s
patriotism
as
soon
as
he
saw
her
you
are
wounded
she
said
oh
it
is
nothing
mademoiselle
he
replied
the
wound
is
just
at
this
moment
the
loud
cries
of
the
vendors
of
newspapers
came
up
from
the
street
condemned
to
death
they
all
trembled
and
the
soldier
was
the
first
to
hear
a
name
that
turned
him
pale
labedoyere
he
cried
falling
on
a
stool
they
looked
at
each
other
in
silence
drops
gathered
on
the
livid
forehead
of
the
young
man
he
seized
the
black
tufts
of
his
hair
in
one
hand
with
a
gesture
of
despair
and
rested
his
elbow
on
ginevra
s
easel
after
all
he
said
rising
abruptly
labedoyere
and
i
knew
what
we
were
doing
we
were
certain
of
the
fate
that
awaited
us
whether
from
triumph
or
defeat
he
dies
for
the
cause
and
here
am
i
hiding
myself
he
rushed
toward
the
door
of
the
studio
but
quicker
than
he
ginevra
reached
it
and
barred
his
way
can
you
restore
the
emperor
she
said
do
you
expect
to
raise
that
giant
who
could
not
maintain
himself
but
what
can
i
do
said
the
young
man
addressing
the
two
friends
whom
chance
had
sent
to
him
i
have
not
a
relation
in
the
world
labedoyere
was
my
protector
and
my
friend
without
him
i
am
alone
i
myself
may
be
condemned
my
only
fortune
was
my
pay
i
spent
my
last
penny
to
come
here
and
try
to
snatch
labedoyere
from
his
fate
death
is
therefore
a
necessity
for
me
when
a
man
decides
to
die
he
ought
to
know
how
to
sell
his
life
to
the
executioner
i
was
thinking
just
now
that
the
life
of
an
honest
man
is
worth
that
of
two
traitors
and
the
blow
of
a
dagger
well
placed
may
give
this
spasm
of
despair
alarmed
the
painter
and
even
ginevra
whose
own
nature
comprehended
that
of
the
young
man
she
admired
his
handsome
face
and
his
delightful
voice
the
sweetness
of
which
was
scarcely
lessened
by
its
tones
of
fury
then
all
of
a
sudden
she
poured
a
balm
upon
the
wounds
of
the
unfortunate
man
monsieur
she
said
as
for
your
pecuniary
distress
permit
me
to
offer
you
my
savings
my
father
is
rich
i
am
his
only
child
he
loves
me
and
i
am
sure
he
will
never
blame
me
have
no
scruple
in
accepting
my
offer
our
property
is
derived
from
the
emperor
we
do
not
own
a
penny
that
is
not
the
result
of
his
munificence
is
it
not
gratitude
to
him
to
assist
his
faithful
soldiers
take
the
sums
you
need
as
indifferently
as
i
offer
them
it
is
only
money
she
added
in
a
tone
of
contempt
now
as
for
friends
those
you
shall
she
raised
her
head
proudly
and
her
eyes
shone
with
dazzling
brilliancy
the
head
which
falls
before
a
dozen
muskets
will
save
yours
she
went
on
wait
till
the
storm
is
over
you
can
then
escape
and
take
service
in
foreign
countries
if
you
are
not
forgotten
here
or
in
the
french
army
if
you
in
the
comfort
that
women
give
there
is
always
a
delicacy
which
has
something
maternal
foreseeing
and
complete
about
it
but
when
the
words
of
hope
and
peace
are
said
with
grace
of
gesture
and
that
eloquence
of
tone
which
comes
from
the
heart
and
when
above
all
the
benefactress
is
beautiful
a
young
man
does
not
resist
the
prisoner
breathed
in
love
through
all
his
senses
a
rosy
tinge
colored
his
white
cheeks
his
eyes
lost
something
of
the
sadness
that
dulled
them
and
he
said
in
a
peculiar
tone
of
voice
you
are
an
angle
of
goodness
but
labedoyere
he
added
oh
labedoyere
at
this
cry
they
all
three
looked
at
one
another
in
silence
each
comprehending
the
others
thoughts
no
longer
friends
of
twenty
minutes
only
they
were
friends
of
twenty
years
dear
friend
said
servin
can
you
save
him
i
can
avenge
ginevra
quivered
though
the
stranger
was
handsome
his
appearance
had
not
influenced
her
the
soft
pity
in
a
woman
s
heart
for
miseries
that
are
not
ignoble
had
stifled
in
ginevra
all
other
emotions
but
to
hear
a
cry
of
vengeance
to
find
in
that
proscribed
being
an
italian
soul
devotion
to
napoleon
corsican
generosity
ah
that
was
indeed
too
much
for
her
she
looked
at
the
officer
with
a
respectful
emotion
which
shook
his
heart
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
a
man
had
caused
her
a
keen
emotion
she
now
like
other
women
put
the
soul
of
the
stranger
on
a
par
with
the
noble
beauty
of
his
features
and
the
happy
proportions
of
his
figure
which
she
admired
as
an
artist
led
by
accidental
curiosity
to
pity
from
pity
to
a
powerful
interest
she
came
through
that
interest
to
such
profound
sensations
that
she
felt
she
was
in
danger
if
she
stayed
there
longer
until
then
she
said
giving
the
officer
a
gentle
smile
by
way
of
a
parting
consolation
seeing
that
smile
which
threw
a
new
light
on
ginevra
s
features
the
stranger
forgot
all
else
for
an
instant
he
said
sadly
but
labedoyere
ginevra
turned
put
a
finger
on
her
lips
and
looked
at
him
as
if
to
say
be
calm
be
and
the
young
man
cried
out
in
his
own
language
ah
dio
che
non
vorrei
vivere
dopo
averla
veduta
who
would
not
wish
to
live
after
seeing
her
the
peculiar
accent
with
which
he
pronounced
the
words
made
ginevra
quiver
are
you
corsican
she
cried
returning
toward
him
with
a
beating
heart
i
was
born
in
corsica
he
replied
but
i
was
brought
while
very
young
to
genoa
and
as
soon
as
i
was
old
enough
for
military
service
i
the
beauty
of
the
young
man
the
mighty
charm
lent
to
him
by
his
attachment
to
the
emperor
his
wound
his
misfortunes
his
danger
all
disappeared
to
ginevra
s
mind
or
rather
all
were
blended
in
one
sentiment
a
new
and
delightful
sentiment
this
persecuted
man
was
a
child
of
corsica
he
spoke
its
cherished
language
she
stood
for
a
moment
motionless
held
by
a
magical
sensation
before
her
eyes
was
a
living
picture
to
which
all
human
sentiments
united
by
chance
gave
vivid
colors
by
servin
s
invitation
the
officer
had
seated
himself
on
a
divan
and
the
painter
after
removing
the
sling
which
supported
the
arm
of
his
guest
was
undoing
the
bandages
in
order
to
dress
the
wound
ginevra
shuddered
when
she
saw
the
long
broad
gash
made
by
the
blade
of
a
sabre
on
the
young
man
s
forearm
and
a
moan
escaped
her
the
stranger
raised
his
head
and
smiled
to
her
there
was
something
touching
which
went
to
the
soul
in
the
care
with
which
servin
lifted
the
lint
and
touched
the
lacerated
flesh
while
the
face
of
the
wounded
man
though
pale
and
sickly
expressed
as
he
looked
at
the
girl
more
pleasure
than
suffering
an
artist
would
have
admired
involuntarily
this
opposition
of
sentiments
together
with
the
contrasts
produced
by
the
whiteness
of
the
linen
and
the
bared
arm
to
the
red
and
blue
uniform
of
the
officer
at
this
moment
a
soft
pervaded
the
studio
but
a
parting
ray
of
the
evening
sunlight
suddenly
illuminated
the
spot
where
the
soldier
sat
so
that
his
noble
blanched
face
his
black
hair
and
his
clothes
were
bathed
in
its
glow
the
effect
was
simple
enough
but
to
the
girl
s
italian
imagination
it
was
a
happy
omen
the
stranger
seemed
to
her
a
celestial
messenger
speaking
the
language
of
her
own
country
he
thus
unconsciously
put
her
under
the
spell
of
childhood
s
memories
while
in
her
heart
there
dawned
another
feeling
as
fresh
as
pure
as
her
own
innocence
for
a
short
very
short
moment
she
was
motionless
and
dreamy
as
though
she
were
plunged
in
boundless
thought
then
she
blushed
at
having
allowed
her
absorption
to
be
noticed
exchanged
one
soft
and
rapid
glance
with
the
wounded
man
and
fled
with
the
vision
of
him
still
before
her
eyes
the
next
day
was
not
a
but
ginevra
came
to
the
studio
and
the
prisoner
was
free
to
sit
beside
her
easel
servin
who
had
a
sketch
to
finish
played
the
part
of
mentor
to
the
two
young
people
who
talked
to
each
other
chiefly
in
corsican
the
soldier
related
the
sufferings
of
the
retreat
from
moscow
for
at
nineteen
years
of
age
he
had
made
the
passage
of
the
beresins
and
was
almost
the
last
man
left
of
his
regiment
he
described
in
words
of
fire
the
great
disaster
of
waterloo
his
voice
was
music
itself
to
the
italian
girl
brought
up
as
a
corsican
ginevra
was
in
some
sense
a
child
of
nature
falseness
was
a
thing
unknown
to
her
she
gave
herself
up
without
reserve
to
her
impressions
she
acknowledged
them
or
rather
allowed
them
to
be
seen
without
the
affectations
of
petty
and
calculating
coquetry
characteristic
of
parisian
girlhood
during
this
day
she
sat
more
than
once
with
her
palette
in
one
hand
her
brushes
in
another
without
touching
a
color
with
her
eyes
fastened
on
the
officer
and
her
lips
slightly
apart
she
listened
in
the
attitude
of
painting
a
stroke
which
was
never
painted
she
was
not
surprised
to
see
such
softness
in
the
eyes
of
the
young
man
for
she
felt
that
her
own
were
soft
in
spite
of
her
will
to
keep
them
stern
and
calm
after
periods
like
this
she
painted
diligently
without
raising
her
head
for
he
was
there
near
her
watching
her
work
the
first
time
he
sat
down
beside
her
to
contemplate
her
silently
she
said
in
a
voice
of
some
emotion
after
a
long
pause
does
it
amuse
you
to
see
me
paint
that
day
she
learned
that
his
name
was
luigi
before
separating
it
was
agreed
between
them
that
if
on
when
they
could
not
see
each
other
any
important
political
event
occurred
ginevra
was
to
inform
him
by
singing
certain
corsican
melodies
then
agreed
upon
the
following
day
mademoiselle
thirion
informed
all
the
members
of
the
class
under
pledge
of
secrecy
that
ginevra
di
piombo
had
a
lover
a
young
man
who
came
during
the
hours
for
the
lesson
and
concealed
himself
in
the
garret
beyond
the
studio
you
who
take
her
part
she
said
to
mademoiselle
roguin
watch
her
carefully
and
you
will
see
how
she
spends
her
ginevra
was
therefore
observed
with
diabolical
attention
they
listened
to
her
songs
they
watched
her
glances
at
times
when
she
supposed
that
no
one
saw
her
a
dozen
pairs
of
eyes
were
furtively
upon
her
thus
enlightened
the
girls
were
able
to
interpret
truly
the
emotions
that
crossed
the
features
of
the
beautiful
italian
her
gestures
the
peculiar
tones
in
which
she
hummed
a
tune
and
the
attention
with
which
they
saw
her
listen
to
sounds
which
only
she
could
hear
through
the
partition
by
the
end
of
a
week
laure
was
the
only
one
of
servin
s
fifteen
pupils
who
had
resisted
the
temptation
of
looking
at
luigi
through
the
crevice
of
the
partition
and
she
through
an
instinct
of
weakness
still
defended
her
beautiful
friend
mademoiselle
roguin
endeavored
to
make
her
wait
on
the
staircase
after
the
class
dispersed
that
she
might
prove
to
her
the
intimacy
of
ginevra
and
the
young
man
by
entering
the
studio
and
surprising
them
together
but
laure
refused
to
condescend
to
an
act
of
espial
which
no
curiosity
could
justify
and
she
consequently
became
the
object
of
much
reprobation
before
long
mademoiselle
thirion
made
known
that
she
thought
it
improper
to
attend
the
classes
of
a
painter
whose
opinions
were
tainted
with
patriotism
and
bonapartism
in
those
days
the
terms
were
synonymous
and
she
ceased
her
attendance
at
the
studio
but
although
she
herself
forgot
ginevra
the
harm
she
had
planted
bore
fruit
little
by
little
the
other
young
girls
revealed
to
their
mothers
the
strange
events
which
were
happening
at
the
studio
one
day
matilde
roguin
did
not
come
the
next
day
another
girl
was
missing
and
so
on
till
the
last
three
or
four
who
were
left
came
no
more
ginevra
and
laure
her
little
friend
were
the
sole
occupants
of
the
deserted
studio
for
three
or
four
days
ginevra
did
not
observe
this
falling
off
nor
ask
the
cause
of
her
companions
absence
as
soon
as
she
had
invented
means
of
communication
with
luigi
she
lived
in
the
studio
in
a
delightful
solitude
alone
amid
her
own
world
thinking
only
of
the
officer
and
the
dangers
that
threatened
him
though
a
sincere
admirer
of
noble
characters
that
never
betray
their
political
faiths
she
nevertheless
urged
luigi
to
submit
himself
to
the
royal
authority
that
he
might
be
released
from
his
present
life
and
remain
in
france
but
to
this
he
would
not
consent
if
passions
are
born
and
nourished
as
they
say
under
the
influence
of
romantic
causes
never
did
so
many
circumstances
of
that
kind
concur
in
uniting
two
young
souls
by
one
and
the
same
sentiment
the
friendship
of
ginevra
for
luigi
and
that
of
luigi
for
ginevra
made
more
progress
in
a
month
than
a
friendship
in
society
would
make
in
ten
years
adversity
is
the
touchstone
of
character
ginevra
was
able
therefore
to
study
luigi
to
know
him
and
before
long
they
mutually
esteemed
each
other
the
girl
who
was
older
than
luigi
found
a
charm
in
being
courted
by
a
youth
already
so
grand
so
tried
by
fate
a
youth
who
joined
to
the
experience
of
a
man
the
graces
of
adolescence
luigi
on
his
side
felt
an
unspeakable
pleasure
in
allowing
himself
to
be
apparently
protected
by
a
woman
now
years
of
age
was
it
not
a
proof
of
love
the
union
of
gentleness
and
pride
strength
and
weakness
in
ginevra
were
to
him
irresistible
attractions
and
he
was
utterly
subjugated
by
her
in
short
before
long
they
loved
each
other
so
profoundly
that
they
felt
no
need
of
denying
to
each
other
their
love
nor
yet
of
telling
it
one
day
towards
evening
ginevra
heard
the
accustomed
signal
luigi
scratched
with
a
pin
on
the
woodwork
in
a
manner
that
produced
no
more
noise
than
a
spider
might
make
as
he
fastened
his
thread
the
signal
meant
that
he
wished
to
come
out
of
his
retreat
ginevra
glanced
around
the
studio
and
not
seeing
laure
opened
the
door
but
as
she
did
so
luigi
caught
sight
of
the
little
pupil
and
abruptly
retired
surprised
at
his
action
ginevra
looked
round
saw
laure
and
said
as
she
went
up
to
the
girl
s
easel
you
are
staying
late
my
dear
that
head
seems
to
me
finished
you
only
want
a
see
on
that
knot
of
you
would
do
me
a
great
kindness
said
laure
in
a
trembling
voice
if
you
would
give
this
copy
a
few
touches
for
then
i
could
carry
away
with
me
something
to
remind
me
of
willingly
said
ginevra
painting
a
few
strokes
on
the
picture
but
i
thought
it
was
a
long
way
from
your
home
to
the
studio
and
it
is
oh
ginevra
i
am
going
away
never
to
return
cried
the
poor
girl
sadly
you
mean
to
leave
monsieur
servin
exclaimed
ginevra
less
affected
however
by
this
news
than
she
would
have
been
a
month
earlier
haven
t
you
noticed
ginevra
that
for
some
days
past
you
and
i
have
been
alone
in
the
studio
true
said
ginevra
as
if
struck
by
a
sudden
recollection
are
all
those
young
ladies
ill
or
going
to
be
married
or
are
their
fathers
on
duty
at
court
they
have
left
monsieur
servin
replied
laure
why
on
your
account
my
account
repeated
the
corsican
springing
up
with
a
threatening
brow
and
her
eyes
flashing
oh
don
t
be
angry
my
kind
ginevra
cried
laure
in
deep
distress
my
mother
insists
on
my
leaving
the
studio
the
young
ladies
say
that
you
have
some
intrigue
and
that
monsieur
servin
allows
the
young
man
whom
you
love
to
stay
in
the
dark
attic
i
have
never
believed
these
calumnies
nor
said
a
word
to
my
mother
about
them
but
last
night
madame
roguin
met
her
at
a
ball
and
asked
her
if
she
still
sent
me
here
when
my
mother
answered
yes
madame
roguin
told
her
the
falsehoods
of
those
young
ladies
mamma
scolded
me
severely
she
said
i
must
have
known
it
all
and
that
i
had
failed
in
proper
confidence
between
mother
and
daughter
by
not
telling
her
oh
my
dear
ginevra
i
who
took
you
for
my
model
oh
how
grieved
i
am
that
i
can
t
be
your
companion
any
we
shall
meet
again
in
life
girls
marry
said
ginevra
when
they
are
rich
signed
laure
come
and
see
me
my
father
has
a
fortune
ginevra
continued
laure
tenderly
madame
roguin
and
my
mother
are
coming
to
see
monsieur
servin
and
reproach
him
hadn
t
you
better
warn
a
thunderbolt
falling
at
ginevra
s
feet
could
not
have
astonished
her
more
than
this
revelation
what
matter
is
it
to
them
she
asked
naively
everybody
thinks
it
very
wrong
mamma
says
it
is
and
you
laure
what
do
you
say
the
young
girl
looked
up
at
ginevra
and
their
thoughts
united
laure
could
no
longer
keep
back
her
tears
she
flung
herself
on
her
friend
s
breast
and
sobbed
at
this
moment
servin
came
into
the
studio
mademoiselle
ginevra
he
cried
with
enthusiasm
i
have
finished
my
picture
it
is
now
being
varnished
what
have
you
been
doing
meanwhile
where
are
the
young
ladies
are
they
taking
a
holiday
or
are
they
in
the
country
laure
dried
her
tears
bowed
to
monsieur
servin
and
went
away
the
studio
has
been
deserted
for
some
days
replied
ginevra
and
the
young
ladies
are
not
coming
pooh
oh
don
t
laugh
said
ginevra
listen
i
am
the
involuntary
cause
of
the
loss
of
your
reputation
the
artist
smiled
and
said
interrupting
his
pupil
my
reputation
why
in
a
few
days
my
picture
will
make
it
at
the
that
relates
to
your
talent
replied
the
girl
i
am
speaking
of
your
morality
those
young
ladies
have
told
their
mothers
that
luigi
was
shut
up
here
and
that
you
lent
yourself
to
our
there
is
some
truth
in
that
mademoiselle
replied
the
professor
the
mothers
of
those
young
ladies
are
foolish
women
if
they
had
come
straight
to
me
i
should
have
explained
the
matter
but
i
don
t
care
a
straw
about
it
life
is
short
and
the
painter
snapped
his
fingers
above
his
head
luigi
who
had
heard
part
of
the
conversation
came
in
you
have
lost
all
your
scholars
he
cried
i
have
ruined
you
the
artist
took
luigi
s
hand
and
that
of
ginevra
and
joined
them
marry
one
another
my
children
he
said
with
fatherly
kindness
they
both
dropped
their
eyes
and
their
silence
was
the
first
avowal
they
had
made
to
each
other
of
their
love
you
will
surely
be
happy
said
servin
there
is
nothing
in
life
to
equal
the
happiness
of
two
beings
like
yourselves
when
bound
together
in
luigi
pressed
the
hand
of
his
protector
without
at
first
being
able
to
utter
a
word
but
presently
he
said
in
a
voice
of
emotion
to
you
i
owe
it
be
happy
i
bless
and
wed
you
said
the
painter
with
comic
unction
laying
his
hands
upon
the
heads
of
the
lovers
this
little
jest
put
an
end
to
their
strained
emotion
all
three
looked
at
one
another
and
laughed
merrily
ginevra
pressed
luigi
s
hand
in
a
strong
clasp
with
a
simplicity
of
action
worthy
of
the
customs
of
her
native
land
ah
ca
my
dear
children
resumed
servin
you
think
that
all
will
go
right
now
but
you
are
much
the
lovers
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
don
t
be
anxious
i
m
the
only
one
that
your
romance
will
harm
but
the
fact
is
madame
servin
is
a
little
straitlaced
and
i
don
t
really
see
how
we
are
to
settle
it
with
heavens
and
i
forgot
to
tell
you
exclaimed
ginevra
that
madame
roguin
and
laure
s
mother
are
coming
here
to
i
understand
said
the
painter
but
you
can
easily
justify
yourself
continued
the
girl
with
a
proud
movement
of
her
head
monsieur
luigi
she
added
turning
to
him
with
an
arch
look
will
no
longer
object
to
entering
the
royal
service
well
then
after
receiving
a
smile
from
the
young
man
morning
i
will
send
a
petition
to
one
of
the
most
influential
persons
at
the
ministry
of
war
a
man
who
will
refuse
nothing
to
the
daughter
of
the
baron
di
piombo
we
shall
obtain
a
tacit
pardon
for
captain
luigi
for
of
course
they
will
not
allow
him
the
rank
of
major
and
then
she
added
addressing
servin
you
can
confound
the
mothers
of
my
charitable
companions
by
telling
them
the
you
are
an
angel
cried
servin
while
this
scene
was
passing
at
the
studio
the
father
and
mother
of
ginevra
were
becoming
impatient
at
her
it
is
six
o
clock
and
ginevra
not
yet
home
cried
bartolomeo
she
was
never
so
late
before
said
his
wife
the
two
old
people
looked
at
each
other
with
an
anxiety
that
was
not
usual
with
them
too
anxious
to
remain
in
one
place
bartolomeo
rose
and
walked
about
the
salon
with
an
active
step
for
a
man
who
was
over
years
of
age
thanks
to
his
robust
constitution
he
had
changed
but
little
since
the
day
of
his
arrival
in
paris
and
despite
his
tall
figure
he
walked
erect
his
hair
now
white
and
sparse
left
uncovered
a
broad
and
protuberant
skull
which
gave
a
strong
idea
of
his
character
and
firmness
his
face
seamed
with
deep
wrinkles
had
taken
with
age
a
nobler
expression
preserving
the
pallid
tones
which
inspire
veneration
the
ardor
of
passions
still
lived
in
the
fire
of
his
eyes
while
the
eyebrows
which
were
not
wholly
whitened
retained
their
terrible
mobility
the
aspect
of
the
head
was
stern
but
it
conveyed
the
impression
that
piombo
had
a
right
to
be
so
his
kindness
his
gentleness
were
known
only
to
his
wife
and
daughter
in
his
functions
or
in
presence
of
strangers
he
never
laid
aside
the
majesty
that
time
had
impressed
upon
his
person
and
the
habit
of
frowning
with
his
heavy
eyebrows
contracting
the
wrinkles
of
his
face
and
giving
to
his
eyes
a
napoleonic
fixity
made
his
manner
of
accosting
others
icy
during
the
course
of
his
political
life
he
had
been
so
generally
feared
that
he
was
thought
unsocial
and
it
is
not
difficult
to
explain
the
causes
of
that
opinion
the
life
morals
and
fidelity
of
piombo
made
him
obnoxious
to
most
courtiers
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
delicate
missions
were
constantly
intrusted
to
his
discretion
which
to
any
other
man
about
the
court
would
have
proved
lucrative
he
possessed
an
income
of
not
more
than
thirty
thousand
francs
from
an
investment
in
the
grand
livre
if
we
recall
the
cheapness
of
government
securities
under
the
empire
and
the
liberality
of
napoleon
towards
those
of
his
faithful
servants
who
knew
how
to
ask
for
it
we
can
readily
see
that
the
baron
di
piombo
must
have
been
a
man
of
stern
integrity
he
owed
his
plumage
as
baron
to
the
necessity
napoleon
felt
of
giving
him
a
title
before
sending
him
on
missions
to
foreign
courts
bartolomeo
had
always
professed
a
hatred
to
the
traitors
with
whom
napoleon
surrounded
himself
expecting
to
bind
them
to
his
cause
by
dint
of
victories
it
was
he
of
whom
it
is
told
that
he
made
three
steps
to
the
door
of
the
emperor
s
cabinet
after
advising
him
to
get
rid
of
three
men
in
france
on
the
eve
of
napoleon
s
departure
for
his
celebrated
and
admirable
campaign
of
after
the
second
return
of
the
bourbons
bartolomeo
ceased
to
wear
the
decoration
of
the
legion
of
honor
no
man
offered
a
finer
image
of
those
old
republicans
incorruptible
friends
to
the
empire
who
remained
the
living
relics
of
the
two
most
energetic
governments
the
world
has
ever
seen
though
the
baron
di
piombo
displeased
mere
courtiers
he
had
the
darus
drouots
and
carnots
with
him
as
friends
as
for
the
rest
of
the
politicians
he
cared
not
a
whiff
of
his
cigar
s
smoke
for
them
especially
since
waterloo
bartolomeo
di
piombo
had
bought
for
the
very
moderate
sum
which
madame
mere
the
emperor
s
mother
had
paid
him
for
his
estates
in
corsica
the
old
mansion
of
the
portenduere
family
in
which
he
had
made
no
changes
lodged
usually
at
the
cost
of
the
government
he
did
not
occupy
this
house
until
after
the
catastrophe
of
fontainebleau
following
the
habits
of
simple
persons
of
strict
virtue
the
baron
and
his
wife
gave
no
heed
to
external
splendor
their
furniture
was
that
which
they
bought
with
the
mansion
the
grand
apartments
lofty
sombre
and
bare
the
wide
mirrors
in
gilded
frames
that
were
almost
black
the
furniture
of
the
period
of
louis
xiv
were
in
keeping
with
bartolomeo
and
his
wife
personages
worthy
of
antiquity
under
the
empire
and
during
the
hundred
days
while
exercising
functions
that
were
liberally
rewarded
the
old
corsican
had
maintained
a
great
establishment
more
for
the
purpose
of
doing
honor
to
his
office
than
from
any
desire
to
shine
himself
his
life
and
that
of
his
wife
were
so
frugal
so
tranquil
that
their
modest
fortune
sufficed
for
all
their
wants
to
them
their
daughter
ginevra
was
more
precious
than
the
wealth
of
the
whole
world
when
therefore
in
may
the
baron
di
piombo
resigned
his
office
dismissed
his
crowd
of
servants
and
closed
his
stable
door
ginevra
quiet
simple
and
unpretending
like
her
parents
saw
nothing
to
regret
in
the
change
like
all
great
souls
she
found
her
luxury
in
strength
of
feeling
and
derived
her
happiness
from
quietness
and
work
these
three
beings
loved
each
other
too
well
for
the
externals
of
existence
to
be
of
value
in
their
eyes
often
and
especially
after
the
second
dreadful
fall
of
napoleon
bartolomeo
and
his
wife
passed
delightful
evenings
alone
with
their
daughter
listening
while
she
sang
and
played
to
them
there
was
a
vast
secret
pleasure
in
the
presence
in
the
slightest
word
of
that
child
their
eyes
followed
her
with
tender
anxiety
they
heard
her
step
in
the
lightly
as
she
trod
like
lovers
the
three
would
often
sit
silently
together
understanding
thus
better
than
by
speech
the
eloquence
of
their
souls
this
profound
sentiment
the
life
itself
of
the
two
old
people
animated
their
every
thought
here
were
not
three
existences
but
one
one
only
which
like
the
flame
on
the
hearth
divided
itself
into
three
tongues
of
fire
if
occasionally
some
memory
of
napoleon
s
benefits
and
misfortunes
if
the
public
events
of
the
moment
distracted
the
minds
of
the
old
people
from
this
source
of
their
constant
solicitude
they
could
always
talk
of
those
interests
without
affecting
their
community
of
thought
for
ginevra
shared
their
political
passions
what
more
natural
therefore
than
the
ardor
with
which
they
found
a
refuge
in
the
heart
of
their
only
child
until
now
the
occupations
of
public
life
had
absorbed
the
energy
of
the
baron
di
piombo
but
after
leaving
those
employments
he
felt
the
need
of
casting
that
energy
into
the
last
sentiment
that
remained
to
him
apart
from
the
ties
of
parentage
there
may
have
been
unknown
to
these
three
despotic
souls
another
powerful
reason
for
the
intensity
of
their
reciprocal
love
it
was
love
undivided
ginevra
s
whole
heart
belonged
to
her
father
as
piombo
s
whole
heart
belonged
to
his
child
and
if
it
be
true
that
we
are
bound
to
one
another
more
by
our
defects
than
by
our
virtues
ginevra
echoed
in
a
marvellous
manner
the
passions
of
her
father
there
lay
the
sole
imperfection
of
this
triple
life
ginevra
was
born
unyielding
of
will
vindictive
and
passionate
like
her
father
in
his
youth
the
corsican
had
taken
pleasure
in
developing
these
savage
sentiments
in
the
heart
of
his
daughter
precisely
as
a
lion
teaches
the
to
spring
upon
their
prey
but
this
apprenticeship
to
vengeance
having
no
means
of
action
in
their
family
life
it
came
to
pass
that
ginevra
turned
the
principle
against
her
father
as
a
child
she
forgave
him
nothing
and
he
was
forced
to
yield
to
her
piombo
saw
nothing
more
than
childish
nonsense
in
these
fictitious
quarrels
but
the
child
was
all
the
while
acquiring
a
habit
of
ruling
her
parents
in
the
midst
however
of
the
tempests
which
the
father
was
fond
of
exciting
a
look
a
word
of
tenderness
sufficed
to
pacify
their
angry
souls
and
often
they
were
never
so
near
to
a
kiss
as
when
they
were
threatening
each
other
vehemently
nevertheless
for
the
last
five
years
ginevra
grown
wiser
than
her
father
avoided
such
scenes
her
faithfulness
her
devotion
the
love
which
filled
her
every
thought
and
her
admirable
good
sense
had
got
the
better
of
her
temper
and
yet
for
all
that
a
very
great
evil
had
resulted
from
her
training
ginevra
lived
with
her
father
and
mother
on
the
footing
of
an
equality
which
is
always
dangerous
piombo
and
his
wife
persons
without
education
had
allowed
ginevra
to
study
as
she
pleased
following
her
caprices
as
a
young
girl
she
had
studied
all
things
for
a
time
and
then
abandoned
them
taking
up
and
leaving
each
train
of
thought
at
will
until
at
last
painting
had
proved
to
be
her
dominant
passion
ginevra
would
have
made
a
noble
woman
had
her
mother
been
capable
of
guiding
her
studies
of
enlightening
her
mind
and
bringing
into
harmony
her
gifts
of
nature
her
defects
came
from
the
fatal
education
which
the
old
corsican
had
found
delight
in
giving
her
after
marching
up
and
down
the
room
for
some
time
piombo
rang
the
bell
a
servant
entered
go
and
meet
mademoiselle
ginevra
said
his
master
i
always
regret
our
carriage
on
her
account
remarked
the
baroness
she
said
she
did
not
want
one
replied
piombo
looking
at
his
wife
who
accustomed
for
forty
years
to
habits
of
obedience
lowered
her
eyes
and
said
no
more
already
a
septuagenarian
tall
withered
pale
and
wrinkled
the
baroness
exactly
resembled
those
old
women
whom
schnetz
puts
into
the
italian
scenes
of
his
genre
pictures
she
was
so
habitually
silent
that
she
might
have
been
taken
for
another
shandy
but
occasionally
a
word
look
or
gesture
betrayed
that
her
feelings
still
retained
all
the
vigor
and
the
freshness
of
their
youth
her
dress
devoid
of
coquetry
was
often
in
bad
taste
she
usually
sat
passive
buried
in
a
low
sofa
like
a
sultana
valide
awaiting
or
admiring
her
ginevra
her
pride
her
life
the
beauty
toilet
and
grace
of
her
daughter
seemed
to
have
become
her
own
all
was
well
with
her
if
ginevra
was
happy
her
hair
was
white
and
a
few
strands
only
were
seen
above
her
white
and
wrinkled
forehead
or
beside
her
hollow
cheeks
it
is
now
fifteen
days
she
said
since
ginevra
made
a
practice
of
being
jean
is
so
slow
cried
the
impatient
old
man
buttoning
up
his
blue
coat
and
seizing
his
hat
which
he
dashed
upon
his
head
as
he
took
his
cane
and
departed
you
will
not
get
far
said
his
wife
calling
after
him
as
she
spoke
the
was
opened
and
shut
and
the
old
mother
heard
the
steps
of
her
ginevra
in
the
bartolomeo
almost
instantly
reappeared
carrying
his
daughter
who
struggled
in
his
arms
chapter
iv
love
here
she
is
my
ginevra
ginevrettina
ginevrola
mia
ginevra
bella
cried
the
old
man
oh
father
you
hurt
me
instantly
ginevra
was
put
down
with
an
air
of
respect
she
nodded
her
head
with
a
graceful
movement
at
her
mother
who
was
frightened
by
her
cry
as
if
to
say
don
t
be
alarmed
it
was
only
a
trick
to
get
the
pale
wan
face
of
the
baroness
recovered
its
usual
tones
and
even
assumed
a
look
of
gayety
piombo
rubbed
his
hands
violently
with
him
the
surest
symptom
of
joy
he
had
taken
to
this
habit
at
court
when
he
saw
napoleon
becoming
angry
with
those
of
his
generals
and
ministers
who
served
him
ill
or
committed
blunders
when
as
now
the
muscles
of
his
face
relaxed
every
wrinkle
on
his
forehead
expressed
benevolence
these
two
old
people
presented
at
this
moment
precisely
the
aspect
of
a
drooping
plant
to
which
a
little
water
has
given
fresh
life
after
long
dryness
now
to
dinner
to
dinner
cried
the
baron
offering
his
large
hand
to
his
daughter
whom
he
called
signora
piombellina
another
symptom
of
gayety
to
which
ginevra
replied
by
a
smile
ah
ca
said
piombo
as
they
left
the
table
your
mother
has
called
my
attention
to
the
fact
that
for
some
weeks
you
have
stayed
much
longer
than
usual
at
the
studio
it
seems
that
painting
is
more
to
you
than
your
parents
oh
father
ginevra
is
preparing
some
surprise
for
us
i
think
said
the
mother
a
picture
of
your
own
will
you
bring
us
that
cried
the
corsican
clapping
his
hands
yes
i
am
very
much
occupied
at
the
studio
replied
ginevra
rather
slowly
what
is
the
matter
ginevra
you
are
turning
pale
cried
her
mother
no
exclaimed
the
young
girl
in
a
tone
of
resolution
no
it
shall
never
be
said
that
ginevra
piombo
acted
a
hearing
this
singular
exclamation
piombo
and
his
wife
looked
at
their
daughter
in
astonishment
i
love
a
young
man
she
added
in
a
voice
of
emotion
then
not
venturing
to
look
at
her
parents
she
lowered
her
large
eyelids
as
if
to
veil
the
fire
of
her
eyes
is
he
a
prince
asked
her
father
ironically
in
a
tone
of
voice
which
made
the
mother
quail
no
father
she
said
gently
he
is
a
young
man
without
is
he
very
handsome
he
is
very
what
is
he
labedoyere
s
comrade
he
was
proscribed
without
a
refuge
servin
concealed
him
and
servin
is
a
good
fellow
who
has
done
well
cried
piombo
but
you
my
daughter
you
do
wrong
to
love
any
man
except
your
it
does
not
depend
on
me
to
love
or
not
to
love
replied
ginevra
still
gently
i
flattered
myself
continued
her
father
that
my
ginevra
would
be
faithful
to
me
until
i
died
and
that
my
love
and
that
of
her
mother
would
suffice
her
till
then
i
did
not
expect
that
our
tenderness
would
find
a
rival
in
her
soul
and
did
i
ever
reproach
you
for
your
fanaticism
for
napoleon
said
ginevra
have
you
never
loved
any
one
but
me
did
you
not
leave
me
for
months
together
when
you
went
on
missions
i
bore
your
absence
courageously
life
has
necessities
to
which
we
must
all
ginevra
no
you
don
t
love
me
for
myself
your
reproaches
betray
your
intolerable
you
dare
to
blame
your
father
s
love
exclaimed
piombo
his
eyes
flashing
father
i
don
t
blame
you
replied
ginevra
with
more
gentleness
than
her
trembling
mother
expected
you
have
grounds
for
your
egotism
as
i
have
for
my
love
heaven
is
my
witness
that
no
girl
has
ever
fulfilled
her
duty
to
her
parents
better
than
i
have
done
to
you
i
have
never
felt
anything
but
love
and
happiness
where
others
often
see
obligation
it
is
now
fifteen
years
that
i
have
never
left
your
protecting
wing
and
it
has
been
a
most
dear
pleasure
to
me
to
charm
your
life
but
am
i
ungrateful
for
all
this
in
giving
myself
up
to
the
joy
of
loving
is
it
ingratitude
to
desire
a
husband
who
will
protect
me
hereafter
what
do
you
reckon
benefits
with
your
father
ginevra
said
piombo
in
a
dangerous
tone
a
dreadful
pause
then
followed
during
which
no
one
dared
to
speak
bartolomeo
at
last
broke
the
silence
by
crying
out
in
a
tone
oh
stay
with
us
stay
with
your
father
your
old
father
i
can
not
have
you
love
another
man
ginevra
you
will
not
have
long
to
await
your
but
father
remember
that
i
need
not
leave
you
we
shall
be
two
to
love
you
you
will
learn
to
know
the
man
to
whose
care
you
bequeath
me
you
will
be
doubly
cherished
by
me
and
by
him
by
him
who
is
my
other
self
by
me
who
am
all
oh
ginevra
ginevra
cried
the
corsican
clenching
his
fists
why
did
you
not
marry
when
napoleon
brought
me
to
accept
the
idea
why
did
you
not
take
the
counts
and
dukes
he
presented
to
you
they
loved
me
to
order
said
the
girl
besides
they
would
have
made
me
live
with
them
and
i
did
not
wish
to
leave
you
you
don
t
wish
to
leave
me
alone
said
piombo
and
yet
you
marry
that
is
leaving
me
alone
i
know
you
my
daughter
in
that
case
you
would
cease
to
love
us
elisa
he
added
looking
at
his
wife
who
remained
motionless
and
as
if
stupefied
we
have
no
longer
a
daughter
she
wishes
to
the
old
man
sat
down
after
raising
his
hands
to
heaven
with
a
gesture
of
invoking
the
divine
power
then
he
bowed
himself
over
as
if
weighed
down
with
sorrow
ginevra
saw
his
agitation
and
the
restraint
which
he
put
upon
his
anger
touched
her
to
the
heart
she
expected
some
violent
crisis
some
ungovernable
fury
she
had
not
armed
her
soul
against
paternal
gentleness
father
she
said
in
a
tender
voice
no
you
shall
never
be
abandoned
by
your
ginevra
but
love
her
a
little
for
her
own
sake
if
you
know
how
he
loves
me
ah
would
never
make
me
unhappy
comparisons
already
cried
piombo
in
a
terrible
voice
no
i
can
never
endure
the
idea
of
your
marriage
if
he
loved
you
as
you
deserve
to
be
loved
he
would
kill
me
if
he
did
not
love
you
i
should
put
a
dagger
through
the
hands
of
the
old
man
trembled
his
lips
trembled
his
body
trembled
but
his
eyes
flashed
lightnings
ginevra
alone
was
able
to
endure
his
glance
for
her
eyes
flamed
also
and
the
daughter
was
worthy
of
the
sire
oh
to
love
you
what
man
is
worthy
of
such
a
life
continued
piombo
to
love
you
as
a
father
is
paradise
on
earth
who
is
there
worthy
to
be
your
husband
said
ginevra
he
of
whom
i
am
not
he
repeated
piombo
mechanically
who
is
he
whom
i
how
can
he
know
you
enough
to
love
you
father
said
ginevra
with
a
gesture
of
impatience
whether
he
loves
me
or
not
if
i
love
him
you
love
him
cried
piombo
ginevra
bent
her
head
softly
you
love
him
more
than
you
love
us
the
two
feelings
can
not
be
compared
she
replied
is
one
stronger
than
the
other
i
think
it
is
said
ginevra
you
shall
not
marry
him
cried
the
corsican
his
voice
shaking
the
i
shall
marry
him
replied
ginevra
tranquilly
oh
god
cried
the
mother
how
will
this
quarrel
end
santa
virgina
place
thyself
between
them
the
baron
who
had
been
striding
up
and
down
the
room
now
seated
himself
an
icy
sternness
darkened
his
face
he
looked
fixedly
at
his
daughter
and
said
to
her
in
a
gentle
weakened
voice
ginevra
no
you
will
not
marry
him
oh
say
nothing
more
let
me
think
the
contrary
do
you
wish
to
see
your
father
on
his
knees
his
white
hairs
prostrate
before
you
i
supplicate
you
ginevra
piombo
does
not
pass
her
word
and
break
it
she
replied
i
am
your
she
is
right
said
the
baroness
we
are
sent
into
the
world
to
do
you
encourage
her
in
disobedience
said
the
baron
to
his
wife
who
terrified
by
the
word
now
changed
to
marble
refusing
to
obey
an
unjust
order
is
not
disobedience
said
ginevra
no
order
can
be
unjust
from
the
lips
of
your
father
my
daughter
why
do
you
judge
my
action
the
repugnance
that
i
feel
is
counsel
from
on
high
sent
it
may
be
to
protect
you
from
some
great
the
only
evil
could
be
that
he
did
not
love
always
yes
always
she
answered
he
is
my
life
my
good
my
thought
even
if
i
obeyed
you
he
would
be
ever
in
my
soul
to
forbid
me
to
marry
him
is
to
make
me
hate
you
love
us
not
cried
piombo
oh
said
ginevra
shaking
her
head
well
then
forget
him
be
faithful
to
us
after
we
are
gone
you
understand
father
do
you
wish
me
to
long
for
your
death
cried
ginevra
i
shall
outlive
you
children
who
do
not
honor
their
parents
die
early
said
the
father
driven
to
exasperation
all
the
more
reason
why
i
should
marry
and
be
happy
she
replied
this
coolness
and
power
of
argument
increased
piombo
s
trouble
the
blood
rushed
violently
to
his
head
and
his
face
turned
purple
ginevra
shuddered
she
sprang
like
a
bird
on
her
father
s
knee
threw
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
caressed
his
white
hair
exclaiming
tenderly
oh
yes
yes
let
me
die
first
i
could
never
survive
you
my
father
my
kind
father
oh
my
ginevra
my
own
ginevra
replied
piombo
whose
anger
melted
under
this
caress
like
snow
beneath
the
rays
of
the
sun
it
was
time
you
ceased
said
the
baroness
in
a
trembling
voice
poor
mother
ah
ginevretta
mia
bella
ginevra
and
the
father
played
with
his
daughter
as
though
she
were
a
child
of
six
he
amused
himself
by
releasing
the
waving
volume
of
her
hair
by
dandling
her
on
his
knee
there
was
something
of
madness
in
these
expressions
of
his
love
presently
his
daughter
scolded
while
kissing
him
and
tried
by
jesting
to
obtain
admission
for
luigi
but
her
father
also
jesting
refused
she
sulked
then
returned
to
coax
once
more
and
sulked
again
until
by
the
end
of
the
evening
she
was
forced
to
be
content
with
having
impressed
upon
her
father
s
mind
both
her
love
for
luigi
and
the
idea
of
an
approaching
marriage
the
next
day
she
said
no
more
about
her
love
she
was
more
caressing
to
her
father
than
she
had
ever
been
and
testified
the
utmost
gratitude
as
if
to
thank
him
for
the
consent
he
seemed
to
have
given
by
his
silence
that
evening
she
sang
and
played
to
him
for
a
long
time
exclaiming
now
and
then
we
want
a
man
s
voice
for
this
ginevra
was
an
italian
and
that
says
all
at
the
end
of
a
week
her
mother
signed
to
her
she
went
and
elisa
piombo
whispered
in
her
ear
i
have
persuaded
your
father
to
receive
oh
mother
how
happy
you
have
made
me
that
day
ginevra
had
the
joy
of
coming
home
on
the
arm
of
her
luigi
the
officer
came
out
of
his
for
the
second
time
only
the
earnest
appeals
which
ginevra
made
to
the
duc
de
feltre
then
minister
of
war
had
been
crowned
with
complete
success
luigi
s
name
was
replaced
upon
the
roll
of
officers
awaiting
orders
this
was
the
first
great
step
toward
better
things
warned
by
ginevra
of
the
difficulties
he
would
encounter
with
her
father
the
young
man
dared
not
express
his
fear
of
finding
it
impossible
to
please
the
old
man
courageous
under
adversity
brave
on
a
battlefield
he
trembled
at
the
thought
of
entering
piombo
s
salon
ginevra
felt
him
tremble
and
this
emotion
the
source
of
which
lay
in
her
was
to
her
eyes
another
proof
of
love
how
pale
you
are
she
said
to
him
when
they
reached
the
door
of
the
house
oh
ginevra
if
it
concerned
my
life
only
though
bartolomeo
had
been
notified
by
his
wife
of
the
formal
presentation
ginevra
was
to
make
of
her
lover
he
would
not
advance
to
meet
him
but
remained
seated
in
his
usual
and
the
sternness
of
his
brow
was
awful
father
said
ginevra
i
bring
you
a
person
you
will
no
doubt
be
pleased
to
see
a
soldier
who
fought
beside
the
emperor
at
the
baron
rose
cast
a
sidelong
glance
at
luigi
and
said
in
a
sardonic
tone
monsieur
is
not
i
no
longer
wear
the
legion
of
honor
replied
luigi
timidly
still
standing
ginevra
mortified
by
her
father
s
incivility
dragged
forward
a
chair
the
officer
s
answer
seemed
to
satisfy
the
old
servant
of
napoleon
madame
piombo
observing
that
her
husband
s
eyebrows
were
resuming
their
natural
position
said
by
way
of
conversation
monsieur
s
resemblance
to
a
person
we
knew
in
corsica
nina
porta
is
really
nothing
could
be
more
natural
replied
the
young
man
on
whose
face
piombo
s
flaming
eyes
now
rested
nina
was
my
are
you
luigi
porta
asked
the
old
man
bartolomeo
rose
tottered
was
forced
to
lean
against
a
chair
and
beckon
to
his
wife
elisa
piombo
came
to
him
then
the
two
old
people
silently
each
supporting
the
other
left
the
room
abandoning
their
daughter
with
a
sort
of
horror
luigi
porta
bewildered
looked
at
ginevra
who
had
turned
as
white
as
a
marble
statue
and
stood
gazing
at
the
door
through
which
her
father
and
mother
had
disappeared
this
departure
and
this
silence
seemed
to
her
so
solemn
that
for
the
first
time
in
her
whole
life
a
feeling
of
fear
entered
her
soul
she
struck
her
hands
together
with
great
force
and
said
in
a
voice
so
shaken
that
none
but
a
lover
could
have
heard
the
words
what
misery
in
a
word
in
the
name
of
our
love
what
have
i
said
asked
luigi
porta
my
father
she
replied
never
spoke
to
me
of
our
deplorable
history
and
i
was
too
young
when
we
left
corsica
to
know
anything
about
are
we
in
vendetta
asked
luigi
trembling
yes
i
have
heard
my
mother
say
that
the
portas
killed
my
brother
and
burned
our
house
my
father
then
massacred
the
whole
family
how
is
it
that
you
survived
for
you
were
tied
to
the
posts
of
the
bed
before
they
set
fire
to
the
i
do
not
know
replied
luigi
i
was
taken
to
genoa
when
six
years
old
and
given
in
charge
of
an
old
man
named
colonna
no
detail
about
my
family
was
told
to
me
i
knew
only
that
i
was
an
orphan
and
without
property
old
colonna
was
a
father
to
me
and
i
bore
his
name
until
i
entered
the
army
in
order
to
do
that
i
had
to
show
my
certificate
of
birth
in
order
to
prove
my
identity
colonna
then
told
me
still
a
mere
child
that
i
had
enemies
and
he
advised
me
to
take
luigi
as
my
surname
and
so
evade
go
go
luigi
cried
ginevra
no
stay
i
must
go
with
you
so
long
as
you
are
in
my
father
s
house
you
have
nothing
to
fear
but
the
moment
you
leave
it
take
care
you
will
go
from
danger
to
danger
my
father
has
two
corsicans
in
his
service
and
if
he
does
not
lie
in
wait
to
kill
you
they
ginevra
he
said
this
feud
does
it
exist
between
you
and
me
the
girl
smiled
sadly
and
bowed
her
head
presently
she
raised
it
and
said
with
a
sort
of
pride
oh
luigi
our
love
must
be
pure
and
sincere
indeed
to
give
me
strength
to
tread
the
path
i
am
about
to
enter
but
it
involves
a
happiness
that
will
last
throughout
our
lives
will
it
not
luigi
answered
by
a
smile
and
pressed
her
hand
ginevra
comprehended
that
true
love
could
despise
all
vulgar
protestations
at
such
a
moment
this
calm
and
restrained
expression
of
his
feelings
foreshadowed
in
some
sense
their
strength
and
their
duration
the
destiny
of
the
pair
was
then
and
there
decided
ginevra
foresaw
a
cruel
struggle
but
the
idea
of
abandoning
luigi
an
idea
which
may
have
floated
in
her
soul
vanished
completely
his
forever
she
dragged
him
suddenly
with
a
desperate
sort
of
energy
from
her
father
s
house
and
did
not
leave
him
till
she
saw
him
reach
the
house
where
servin
had
engaged
a
modest
lodging
by
the
time
she
reached
home
ginevra
had
attained
to
that
serenity
which
is
caused
by
a
firm
resolution
no
sign
in
her
manner
betrayed
uneasiness
she
turned
on
her
father
and
mother
whom
she
found
in
the
act
of
sitting
down
to
dinner
a
glance
of
exceeding
gentleness
devoid
of
hardihood
she
saw
that
her
mother
had
been
weeping
the
redness
of
those
withered
eyelids
shook
her
heart
but
she
hid
her
emotion
no
one
touched
the
dinner
which
was
served
to
them
a
horror
of
food
is
one
of
the
chief
symptoms
which
reveal
a
great
crisis
in
life
all
three
rose
from
table
without
having
addressed
a
single
word
to
one
another
when
ginevra
had
placed
herself
between
her
father
and
mother
in
the
great
and
gloomy
salon
piombo
tried
to
speak
but
his
voice
failed
him
he
tried
to
walk
but
he
had
no
strength
in
his
legs
he
returned
to
his
seat
and
rang
the
bell
pietro
he
said
at
last
to
the
footman
light
the
fire
i
am
ginevra
trembled
and
looked
at
her
father
anxiously
the
struggle
within
him
must
have
been
horrible
for
his
face
was
distorted
ginevra
knew
the
extent
of
the
peril
before
her
but
she
did
not
flinch
bartolomeo
meanwhile
cast
furtive
glances
at
his
daughter
as
if
he
feared
a
character
whose
violence
was
the
work
of
his
own
hands
between
such
natures
all
things
must
be
extreme
the
certainty
of
some
impending
change
in
the
feelings
of
father
and
daughter
gave
to
the
worn
and
weary
face
of
the
baroness
an
expression
of
terror
ginevra
you
love
the
enemy
of
your
family
said
piombo
at
last
not
daring
to
look
at
his
daughter
that
is
true
she
replied
you
must
choose
between
us
our
vendetta
is
a
part
of
our
being
whoso
does
not
share
my
vengeance
is
not
a
member
of
my
my
choice
is
made
replied
ginevra
calmly
his
daughter
s
tranquillity
misled
bartolomeo
oh
my
dear
child
he
cried
letting
her
see
his
eyes
moistened
with
tears
the
first
and
only
tears
he
ever
shed
in
life
i
shall
be
his
wife
said
ginevra
abruptly
bartolomeo
seemed
dazed
for
a
moment
but
he
recovered
his
coolness
instantly
and
replied
the
marriage
will
not
take
place
in
my
lifetime
i
will
never
consent
to
ginevra
kept
silence
ginevra
continued
the
baron
have
you
reflected
that
luigi
is
the
son
of
the
man
who
killed
your
brother
he
was
six
years
old
when
that
crime
was
committed
he
was
therefore
not
guilty
of
it
she
replied
he
is
a
porta
cried
bartolomeo
i
have
never
shared
that
hatred
said
ginevra
eagerly
you
did
not
bring
me
up
to
think
a
porta
must
be
a
monster
how
could
i
know
that
one
of
those
whom
you
thought
you
had
killed
survived
is
it
not
natural
that
you
should
now
yield
your
vendetta
to
my
feelings
a
porta
repeated
piombo
if
his
father
had
found
you
in
your
bed
you
would
not
be
living
now
he
would
have
taken
your
life
a
hundred
it
may
be
so
she
answered
but
his
son
has
given
me
life
and
more
than
life
to
see
luigi
is
a
happiness
without
which
i
can
not
live
luigi
has
revealed
to
me
the
world
of
sentiments
i
may
perhaps
have
seen
faces
more
beautiful
than
his
but
none
has
ever
charmed
me
thus
i
may
have
heard
voices
no
no
never
any
so
melodious
luigi
loves
me
he
will
be
my
never
said
piombo
i
would
rather
see
you
in
your
coffin
the
old
corsican
rose
and
began
to
stride
up
and
down
the
salon
dropping
the
following
sentences
one
by
one
after
pauses
which
betrayed
his
agitation
you
think
you
can
bend
my
will
undeceive
yourself
a
porta
shall
never
be
my
son
that
is
my
decree
let
there
be
no
further
question
of
this
between
us
i
am
bartolomeo
di
piombo
do
you
hear
me
ginevra
do
you
attach
some
mysterious
meaning
to
those
words
she
asked
coldly
they
mean
that
i
have
a
dagger
and
that
i
do
not
fear
man
s
justice
corsicans
explain
themselves
to
and
i
said
the
daughter
rising
am
ginevra
piombo
and
i
declare
that
within
six
months
i
shall
be
the
wife
of
luigi
porta
you
are
a
tyrant
my
father
she
added
after
a
terrifying
pause
bartolomeo
clenched
his
fists
and
struck
them
on
the
marble
of
the
chimneypiece
ah
we
are
in
paris
he
muttered
then
he
was
silent
crossed
his
arms
bowed
his
head
on
his
breast
and
said
not
another
word
during
the
whole
evening
after
once
giving
utterance
to
her
will
ginevra
affected
inconceivable
coolness
she
opened
the
piano
and
sang
played
charming
nocturnes
and
scherzos
with
a
grace
and
sentiment
which
displayed
a
perfect
freedom
of
mind
thus
triumphing
over
her
father
whose
darkling
face
showed
no
softening
the
old
man
was
cruelly
hurt
by
this
tacit
insult
he
gathered
in
this
one
moment
the
bitter
fruits
of
the
training
he
had
given
to
his
daughter
respect
is
a
barrier
which
protects
parents
as
it
does
children
sparing
grief
to
the
former
remorse
to
the
latter
the
next
day
when
ginevra
sought
to
leave
the
house
at
the
hour
when
she
usually
went
to
the
studio
she
found
the
gates
of
the
mansion
closed
to
her
she
said
nothing
but
soon
found
means
to
inform
luigi
porta
of
her
father
s
severity
a
chambermaid
who
could
neither
read
nor
write
was
able
to
carry
letters
between
the
lovers
for
five
days
they
corresponded
thus
thanks
to
the
inventive
shrewdness
of
the
youth
the
father
and
daughter
seldom
spoke
to
each
other
both
were
nursing
in
the
depths
of
their
heart
a
sentiment
of
hatred
they
suffered
but
they
suffered
proudly
and
in
silence
recognizing
how
strong
were
the
ties
of
love
which
bound
them
to
each
other
they
each
tried
to
break
them
but
without
success
no
gentle
thought
came
as
formerly
to
brighten
the
stern
features
of
piombo
when
he
contemplated
his
ginevra
the
girl
had
something
savage
in
her
eye
when
she
looked
at
her
father
reproach
sat
enthroned
on
that
innocent
brow
she
gave
herself
up
it
is
true
to
happy
thoughts
and
yet
at
times
remorse
seemed
to
dull
her
eyes
it
was
not
difficult
to
believe
that
she
could
never
enjoy
peacefully
any
happiness
which
caused
sorrow
to
her
parents
with
bartolomeo
as
with
his
daughter
the
hesitations
of
this
period
caused
by
the
native
goodness
of
their
souls
were
nevertheless
compelled
to
give
way
before
their
pride
and
the
rancor
of
their
corsican
nature
they
encouraged
each
other
in
their
anger
and
closed
their
eyes
to
the
future
perhaps
they
mutually
flattered
themselves
that
the
one
would
yield
to
the
other
at
last
on
ginevra
s
birthday
her
mother
in
despair
at
the
estrangement
which
day
by
day
assumed
a
more
serious
character
meditated
an
attempt
to
reconcile
the
father
and
daughter
by
help
of
the
memories
of
this
family
anniversary
they
were
all
three
sitting
in
bartolomeo
s
study
ginevra
guessed
her
mother
s
intention
by
the
timid
hesitation
on
her
face
and
she
smiled
sadly
at
this
moment
a
servant
announced
two
notaries
accompanied
by
witnesses
bartolomeo
looked
fixedly
at
these
persons
whose
cold
and
formal
faces
were
grating
to
souls
so
passionately
strained
as
those
of
the
three
chief
actors
in
this
scene
the
old
man
turned
to
his
daughter
and
looked
at
her
uneasily
he
saw
upon
her
face
a
smile
of
triumph
which
made
him
expect
some
shock
but
after
the
manner
of
savages
he
affected
to
maintain
a
deceitful
indifference
as
he
gazed
at
the
notaries
with
an
assumed
air
of
calm
curiosity
the
strangers
sat
down
after
being
invited
to
do
so
by
a
gesture
of
the
old
man
monsieur
is
no
doubt
le
baron
di
piombo
began
the
oldest
of
the
notaries
bartolomeo
bowed
the
notary
made
a
slight
inclination
of
the
head
looked
at
ginevra
with
a
sly
expression
took
out
his
opened
it
and
slowly
inhaled
a
pinch
as
if
seeking
for
the
words
with
which
to
open
his
errand
then
while
uttering
them
he
made
continual
pauses
an
oratorical
manoeuvre
very
imperfectly
represented
by
the
printer
s
dash
monsieur
he
said
i
am
monsieur
roguin
your
daughter
s
notary
and
we
have
come
my
colleague
and
i
to
fulfil
the
intentions
of
the
law
and
put
an
end
to
the
divisions
which
appear
to
exist
between
yourself
and
mademoiselle
your
daughter
on
the
subject
of
her
marriage
with
monsieur
luigi
this
speech
pedantically
delivered
probably
seemed
to
monsieur
roguin
so
fine
that
his
hearer
could
not
at
once
understand
it
he
paused
and
looked
at
bartolomeo
with
that
peculiar
expression
of
the
mere
business
lawyer
a
mixture
of
servility
with
familiarity
accustomed
to
feign
much
interest
in
the
persons
with
whom
they
deal
notaries
have
at
last
produced
upon
their
features
a
grimace
of
their
own
which
they
take
on
and
off
as
an
official
this
mask
of
benevolence
the
mechanism
of
which
is
so
easy
to
perceive
irritated
bartolomeo
to
such
an
extent
that
he
was
forced
to
collect
all
the
powers
of
his
reason
to
prevent
him
from
throwing
monsieur
roguin
through
the
window
an
expression
of
anger
ran
through
his
wrinkles
which
caused
the
notary
to
think
to
himself
i
ve
produced
an
but
he
continued
in
a
honeyed
tone
monsieur
le
baron
on
such
occasions
our
duties
are
preceded
by
efforts
at
conciliation
deign
therefore
to
have
the
goodness
to
listen
to
me
it
is
in
evidence
that
mademoiselle
ginevra
di
piombo
attains
this
very
day
the
age
at
which
the
law
allows
a
respectful
summons
before
proceeding
to
the
celebration
of
a
marriage
in
spite
of
the
of
the
parents
now
it
is
usual
in
families
who
enjoy
a
certain
consideration
who
belong
to
society
who
preserve
some
dignity
to
whom
in
short
it
is
desirable
not
to
let
the
public
into
the
secret
of
their
differences
and
who
moreover
do
not
wish
to
injure
themselves
by
blasting
with
reprobation
the
future
of
a
young
couple
for
that
is
injuring
themselves
it
is
usual
i
say
among
these
honorable
families
not
to
allow
these
summonses
to
take
place
or
remain
a
monument
to
divisions
which
should
end
by
ceasing
whenever
monsieur
a
young
lady
has
recourse
to
respectful
summons
she
exhibits
a
determination
too
marked
to
allow
of
a
father
of
a
mother
here
he
turned
to
the
baroness
hoping
or
expecting
that
she
will
follow
their
wishes
paternal
resistance
being
null
by
reason
of
this
fact
in
the
first
place
and
also
from
its
being
nullified
by
law
it
is
customary
for
every
sensible
man
after
making
a
final
remonstrance
to
his
child
and
before
she
proceeds
to
the
respectful
summons
to
leave
her
at
liberty
to
monsieur
roguin
stopped
perceiving
that
he
might
talk
on
for
two
hours
without
obtaining
any
answer
he
felt
moreover
a
singular
emotion
at
the
aspect
of
the
man
he
was
attempting
to
convert
an
extraordinary
revolution
had
taken
place
on
piombo
s
face
his
wrinkles
contracting
into
narrow
lines
gave
him
a
look
of
indescribable
cruelty
and
he
cast
upon
the
notary
the
glance
of
a
tiger
the
baroness
was
mute
and
passive
ginevra
calm
and
resolute
waited
silently
she
knew
that
the
notary
s
voice
was
more
potent
than
hers
and
she
seemed
to
have
decided
to
say
nothing
at
the
moment
when
roguin
ceased
speaking
the
scene
had
become
so
terrifying
that
the
men
who
were
there
as
witnesses
trembled
never
perhaps
had
they
known
so
awful
a
silence
the
notaries
looked
at
each
other
as
if
in
consultation
and
finally
rose
and
walked
to
the
window
did
you
ever
meet
people
born
into
the
world
like
that
asked
roguin
of
his
brother
notary
you
can
t
get
anything
out
of
him
replied
the
younger
man
in
your
place
i
should
simply
read
the
summons
that
old
fellow
isn
t
a
comfortable
person
he
is
furious
and
you
ll
gain
nothing
whatever
by
arguing
with
monsieur
roguin
then
read
a
stamped
paper
containing
the
respectful
summons
prepared
for
the
occasion
after
which
he
proceeded
to
ask
bartolomeo
what
answer
he
made
to
it
are
there
laws
in
france
which
destroy
paternal
authority
demanded
the
corsican
monsieur
said
roguin
in
his
honeyed
tones
which
tear
a
daughter
from
her
father
monsieur
which
deprive
an
old
man
of
his
last
consolation
monsieur
your
daughter
only
belongs
to
you
if
and
kill
him
monsieur
permit
me
there
is
nothing
more
horrible
than
the
coolness
and
precise
reasoning
of
notaries
amid
the
many
passionate
scenes
in
which
they
are
accustomed
to
take
part
the
forms
that
piombo
saw
about
him
seemed
to
his
eyes
escaped
from
hell
his
repressed
and
concentrated
rage
knew
no
longer
any
bounds
as
the
calm
and
fluted
voice
of
the
little
notary
uttered
the
words
permit
by
a
sudden
movement
he
sprang
to
a
dagger
that
was
hanging
to
a
nail
above
the
fireplace
and
rushed
toward
his
daughter
the
younger
of
the
two
notaries
and
one
of
the
witnesses
threw
themselves
before
ginevra
but
piombo
knocked
them
violently
down
his
face
on
fire
and
his
eyes
casting
flames
more
terrifying
than
the
glitter
of
the
dagger
when
ginevra
saw
him
approach
her
she
looked
at
him
with
an
air
of
triumph
and
advancing
slowly
knelt
down
no
no
i
can
not
he
cried
flinging
away
the
weapon
which
buried
itself
in
the
wainscot
well
then
have
mercy
have
pity
she
said
you
hesitate
to
be
my
death
and
you
refuse
me
life
oh
father
never
have
i
loved
you
as
i
do
at
this
moment
give
me
luigi
i
ask
for
your
consent
upon
my
knees
a
daughter
can
humiliate
herself
before
her
father
my
luigi
give
me
my
luigi
or
i
die
the
violent
excitement
which
suffocated
her
stopped
her
words
for
she
had
no
voice
her
convulsive
movements
showed
plainly
that
she
lay
as
it
were
between
life
and
death
bartolomeo
roughly
pushed
her
from
him
go
he
said
the
wife
of
luigi
porta
can
not
be
a
piombo
i
have
no
daughter
i
have
not
the
strength
to
curse
you
but
i
cast
you
off
you
have
no
father
my
ginevra
piombo
is
buried
here
he
said
in
a
deep
voice
pressing
violently
on
his
heart
go
leave
my
house
unhappy
girl
he
added
after
a
moment
s
silence
go
and
never
come
into
my
sight
so
saying
he
took
ginevra
by
the
arm
to
the
gate
of
the
house
and
silently
put
her
out
luigi
cried
ginevra
entering
the
humble
lodging
of
her
lover
my
luigi
we
have
no
other
fortune
than
our
then
am
i
richer
than
the
kings
of
the
earth
he
cried
my
father
and
my
mother
have
cast
me
off
she
said
in
deepest
sadness
i
will
love
you
in
place
of
then
let
us
be
happy
we
will
be
happy
she
cried
with
a
gayety
in
which
there
was
something
dreadful
chapter
marriage
the
day
after
ginevra
was
driven
from
her
father
s
house
she
went
to
ask
madame
servin
for
asylum
and
protection
until
the
period
fixed
by
law
for
her
marriage
to
luigi
here
began
for
her
that
apprenticeship
to
trouble
which
the
world
strews
about
the
path
of
those
who
do
not
follow
its
conventions
madame
servin
received
her
very
coldly
being
much
annoyed
by
the
harm
which
ginevra
s
affair
had
inflicted
on
her
husband
and
told
her
in
politely
cautious
words
that
she
must
not
count
on
her
help
in
future
too
proud
to
persist
but
amazed
at
a
selfishness
hitherto
unknown
to
her
the
girl
took
a
room
in
the
that
was
nearest
to
that
of
luigi
the
son
of
the
portas
passed
all
his
days
at
the
feet
of
his
future
wife
and
his
youthful
love
the
purity
of
his
words
dispersed
the
clouds
from
the
mind
of
the
banished
daughter
the
future
was
so
beautiful
as
he
painted
it
that
she
ended
by
smiling
joyfully
though
without
forgetting
her
father
s
severity
one
morning
the
servant
of
the
lodging
house
brought
to
ginevra
s
room
a
number
of
trunks
and
packages
containing
stuffs
linen
clothes
and
a
great
quantity
of
other
articles
necessary
for
a
young
wife
in
setting
up
a
home
of
her
own
in
this
welcome
provision
she
recognized
her
mother
s
foresight
and
on
examining
the
gifts
she
found
a
purse
in
which
the
baroness
had
put
the
money
belonging
to
her
daughter
adding
to
it
the
amount
of
her
own
savings
the
purse
was
accompanied
by
a
letter
in
which
the
mother
implored
the
daughter
to
forego
the
fatal
marriage
if
it
were
still
possible
to
do
so
it
had
cost
her
she
said
untold
difficulty
to
send
these
few
things
to
her
daughter
she
entreated
her
not
to
think
her
hard
if
henceforth
she
were
forced
to
abandon
her
to
want
she
feared
she
could
never
again
assist
her
but
she
blessed
her
and
prayed
for
her
happiness
in
this
fatal
marriage
if
indeed
she
persisted
in
making
it
assuring
her
that
she
should
never
cease
to
think
of
her
darling
child
here
the
falling
tears
had
effaced
some
words
of
the
letter
oh
mother
cried
ginevra
deeply
moved
she
felt
the
impulse
to
rush
home
to
breathe
the
blessed
air
of
her
father
s
house
to
fling
herself
at
his
feet
to
see
her
mother
she
was
springing
forward
to
accomplish
this
wish
when
luigi
entered
at
the
mere
sight
of
him
her
filial
emotion
vanished
her
tears
were
stopped
and
she
no
longer
had
the
strength
to
abandon
that
loving
and
unfortunate
youth
to
be
the
sole
hope
of
a
noble
being
to
love
him
and
then
abandon
him
that
sacrifice
is
the
treachery
of
which
young
hearts
are
incapable
ginevra
had
the
generosity
to
bury
her
own
grief
and
suffering
silently
in
her
soul
the
marriage
day
arrived
ginevra
had
no
friend
with
her
while
she
was
dressing
luigi
fetched
the
witnesses
necessary
to
sign
the
certificate
of
marriage
these
witnesses
were
worthy
persons
one
a
cavalry
sergeant
was
under
obligations
to
luigi
contracted
on
the
battlefield
obligations
which
are
never
obliterated
from
the
heart
of
an
honest
man
the
other
a
was
the
proprietor
of
the
house
in
which
the
young
couple
had
hired
an
apartment
for
their
future
home
each
witness
brought
a
friend
and
all
four
with
luigi
came
to
escort
the
bride
little
accustomed
to
social
functions
and
seeing
nothing
in
the
service
they
were
rendering
to
luigi
but
a
simple
matter
of
business
they
were
dressed
in
their
ordinary
clothes
without
any
luxury
and
nothing
about
them
denoted
the
usual
joy
of
a
marriage
procession
ginevra
herself
was
dressed
simply
as
befitted
her
present
fortunes
and
yet
her
beauty
was
so
noble
and
so
imposing
that
the
words
of
greeting
died
away
on
the
lips
of
the
witnesses
who
supposed
themselves
obliged
to
pay
her
some
usual
compliments
they
bowed
to
her
with
respect
and
she
returned
the
bow
but
they
did
so
in
silence
looking
at
her
with
admiration
this
reserve
cast
a
chill
over
the
whole
party
joy
never
bursts
forth
freely
except
among
those
who
are
equals
thus
chance
determined
that
all
should
be
dull
and
grave
around
the
bridal
pair
nothing
reflected
outwardly
the
happiness
that
reigned
within
their
hearts
the
church
and
the
mayor
s
office
being
near
by
luigi
and
ginevra
followed
by
the
four
witnesses
required
by
law
walked
the
distance
with
a
simplicity
that
deprived
of
all
pomp
this
greatest
event
in
social
life
they
saw
a
crowd
of
waiting
carriages
in
the
mayor
s
and
when
they
reached
the
great
hall
where
the
civil
marriages
take
place
they
found
two
other
impatiently
awaiting
the
mayor
s
arrival
ginevra
sat
down
beside
luigi
at
the
end
of
a
long
bench
their
witnesses
remained
standing
for
want
of
seats
two
brides
elaborately
dressed
in
white
with
ribbons
laces
and
pearls
and
crowned
with
whose
satiny
petals
nodded
beneath
their
veils
were
surrounded
by
joyous
families
and
accompanied
by
their
mothers
to
whom
they
looked
up
now
and
then
with
eyes
that
were
content
and
timid
both
the
faces
of
all
the
rest
reflected
happiness
and
seemed
to
be
invoking
blessings
on
the
youthful
pairs
fathers
witnesses
brothers
and
sisters
went
and
came
like
a
happy
swarm
of
insects
disporting
in
the
sun
each
seemed
to
be
impressed
with
the
value
of
this
passing
moment
of
life
when
the
heart
finds
itself
within
two
hopes
the
wishes
of
the
past
the
promises
of
the
future
as
she
watched
them
ginevra
s
heart
swelled
within
her
she
pressed
luigi
s
arm
and
gave
him
a
look
a
tear
rolled
from
the
eyes
of
the
young
corsican
never
did
he
so
well
understand
the
joys
that
his
ginevra
was
sacrificing
to
him
that
precious
tear
caused
her
to
forget
all
else
but
him
even
the
abandonment
in
which
she
sat
there
love
poured
down
its
treasures
of
light
upon
their
hearts
they
saw
nought
else
but
themselves
in
the
midst
of
the
joyous
tumult
they
were
there
alone
in
that
crowd
as
they
were
destined
to
be
henceforth
in
life
their
witnesses
indifferent
to
what
was
happening
conversed
quietly
on
their
own
affairs
oats
are
very
dear
said
the
sergeant
to
the
mason
but
they
have
not
gone
up
like
lime
relatively
speaking
replied
the
contractor
then
they
walked
round
the
hall
how
one
loses
time
here
said
the
mason
replacing
a
thick
silver
watch
in
his
fob
luigi
and
ginevra
sitting
pressed
to
one
another
seemed
like
one
person
a
poet
would
have
admired
their
two
heads
inspired
by
the
same
sentiment
colored
in
the
same
tones
silent
and
saddened
in
presence
of
that
humming
happiness
sparkling
in
diamonds
gay
with
flowers
a
gayety
in
which
there
was
something
fleeting
the
joy
of
those
noisy
and
splendid
groups
was
visible
that
of
ginevra
and
luigi
was
buried
in
their
bosom
on
one
side
the
tumult
of
common
pleasure
on
the
other
the
delicate
silence
of
happy
souls
earth
and
heaven
but
ginevra
was
not
wholly
free
from
the
weaknesses
of
women
superstitious
as
an
italian
she
saw
an
omen
in
this
contrast
and
in
her
heart
there
lay
a
sense
of
terror
as
invincible
as
her
love
suddenly
the
office
servant
in
the
town
livery
opened
a
silence
reigned
and
his
voice
was
heard
like
the
yapping
of
a
dog
calling
monsieur
luigi
da
porta
and
mademoiselle
ginevra
di
piombo
this
caused
some
embarrassment
to
the
young
pair
the
celebrity
of
the
bride
s
name
attracted
attention
and
the
spectators
seemed
to
wonder
that
the
wedding
was
not
more
sumptuous
ginevra
rose
took
luigi
s
arm
and
advanced
firmly
followed
by
the
witnesses
a
murmur
of
surprise
which
went
on
increasing
and
a
general
whispering
reminded
ginevra
that
all
present
were
wondering
at
the
absence
of
her
parents
her
father
s
wrath
seemed
present
to
her
call
in
the
families
said
the
mayor
to
the
clerk
whose
business
it
was
to
read
aloud
the
certificates
the
father
and
mother
protest
replied
the
clerk
phlegmatically
on
both
sides
inquired
the
mayor
the
groom
is
an
where
are
the
witnesses
here
said
the
clerk
pointing
to
the
four
men
who
stood
with
arms
folded
like
so
many
statues
but
if
the
parents
protest
began
the
mayor
the
respectful
summons
has
been
duly
served
replied
the
clerk
rising
to
lay
before
the
mayor
the
papers
annexed
to
the
marriage
certificate
this
bureaucratic
decision
had
something
blighting
about
it
in
a
few
words
it
contained
the
whole
story
the
hatred
of
the
portas
and
the
piombos
and
their
terrible
passions
were
inscribed
on
this
page
of
the
civil
law
as
the
annals
of
a
people
contained
it
may
be
in
one
word
only
napoleon
robespierre
are
engraved
on
a
tombstone
ginevra
trembled
like
the
dove
on
the
face
of
the
waters
having
no
place
to
rest
its
feet
but
the
ark
so
ginevra
could
take
refuge
only
in
the
eyes
of
luigi
from
the
cold
and
dreary
waste
around
her
the
mayor
assumed
a
stern
disapproving
air
and
his
clerk
looked
up
at
the
couple
with
malicious
curiosity
no
marriage
was
ever
so
little
festal
like
other
human
beings
when
deprived
of
their
accessories
it
became
a
simple
act
in
itself
great
only
in
thought
after
a
few
questions
to
which
the
bride
and
bridegroom
responded
and
a
few
words
mumbled
by
the
mayor
and
after
signing
the
registers
with
their
witnesses
duly
luigi
and
ginevra
were
made
one
then
the
wedded
pair
walked
back
through
two
lines
of
joyous
relations
who
did
not
belong
to
them
and
whose
only
interest
in
their
marriage
was
the
delay
caused
to
their
own
wedding
by
this
gloomy
bridal
when
at
last
ginevra
found
herself
in
the
mayor
s
under
the
open
sky
a
sigh
escaped
her
breast
can
a
lifetime
of
devotion
and
love
suffice
to
prove
my
gratitude
for
your
courage
and
tenderness
my
ginevra
said
luigi
at
these
words
said
with
tears
of
joy
the
bride
forgot
her
sufferings
for
she
had
indeed
suffered
in
presenting
herself
before
the
public
to
obtain
a
happiness
her
parents
refused
to
sanction
why
should
others
come
between
us
she
said
with
an
artlessness
of
feeling
that
delighted
luigi
a
sense
of
accomplished
happiness
now
made
the
step
of
the
young
pair
lighter
they
saw
neither
heaven
nor
earth
nor
houses
they
flew
as
it
were
on
wings
to
the
church
when
they
reached
a
dark
little
chapel
in
one
corner
of
the
building
and
stood
before
a
plain
undecorated
altar
an
old
priest
married
them
there
as
in
the
mayor
s
office
two
other
marriages
were
taking
place
still
pursuing
them
with
pomp
the
church
filled
with
friends
and
relations
echoed
with
the
roll
of
carriages
and
the
hum
of
beadles
sextons
and
priests
altars
were
resplendent
with
sacramental
luxury
the
wreaths
of
that
crowned
the
figures
of
the
virgin
were
fresh
flowers
incense
gleaming
tapers
velvet
cushions
embroidered
with
gold
were
everywhere
when
the
time
came
to
hold
above
the
heads
of
luigi
and
ginevra
the
symbol
of
eternal
union
that
yoke
of
satin
white
soft
brilliant
light
for
some
lead
for
most
the
priest
looked
about
him
in
vain
for
the
acolytes
whose
place
it
was
to
perform
that
joyous
function
two
of
the
witnesses
fulfilled
it
for
them
the
priest
addressed
a
hasty
homily
to
the
pair
on
the
perils
of
life
on
the
duties
they
must
some
day
inculcate
upon
their
children
throwing
in
at
this
point
an
indirect
reproach
to
ginevra
on
the
absence
of
her
parents
then
after
uniting
them
before
god
as
the
mayor
had
united
them
before
the
law
he
left
the
now
married
couple
god
bless
them
said
vergniaud
the
sergeant
to
the
mason
when
they
reached
the
church
porch
no
two
creatures
were
ever
more
fitted
for
one
another
the
parents
of
the
girl
are
foolish
i
don
t
know
a
braver
soldier
than
colonel
luigi
if
the
whole
army
had
behaved
like
him
l
autre
would
be
here
this
blessing
of
the
old
soldier
the
only
one
bestowed
upon
their
shed
a
balm
on
ginevra
s
heart
they
parted
with
hearty
shakings
of
hand
luigi
thanked
his
landlord
adieu
mon
brave
he
said
to
the
sergeant
i
thank
i
am
now
and
ever
at
your
service
colonel
soul
body
horses
and
carriages
all
that
is
mine
is
how
he
loves
you
said
ginevra
luigi
now
hurried
his
bride
to
the
house
they
were
to
occupy
their
modest
apartment
was
soon
reached
and
there
when
the
door
closed
upon
them
luigi
took
his
wife
in
his
arms
exclaiming
oh
my
ginevra
for
now
you
are
mine
here
is
our
true
wedding
here
he
added
all
things
will
smile
upon
together
they
went
through
the
three
rooms
contained
in
their
lodging
the
room
first
entered
served
as
salon
and
in
one
on
the
right
was
a
bedchamber
on
the
left
a
large
study
which
luigi
had
arranged
for
his
wife
in
it
she
found
easels
casts
pictures
portfolios
in
short
the
paraphernalia
of
an
artist
so
here
i
am
to
work
she
said
with
an
expression
of
childlike
happiness
she
looked
long
at
the
hangings
and
the
furniture
turning
again
and
again
to
thank
luigi
for
there
was
something
that
approached
magnificence
in
the
little
retreat
a
bookcase
contained
her
favorite
books
a
piano
filled
an
angle
of
the
room
she
sat
down
upon
a
divan
drew
luigi
to
her
side
and
said
in
a
caressing
voice
her
hand
in
his
you
have
good
those
words
make
me
happy
he
replied
but
let
me
see
all
said
ginevra
to
whom
luigi
had
made
a
mystery
of
the
adornment
of
the
rooms
they
entered
the
nuptial
chamber
fresh
and
white
as
a
virgin
oh
come
away
said
luigi
smiling
but
i
wish
to
see
and
the
imperious
ginevra
looked
at
each
piece
of
furniture
with
the
minute
care
of
an
antiquary
examining
a
coin
she
touched
the
silken
hangings
and
went
over
every
article
with
the
artless
satisfaction
of
a
bride
in
the
treasures
of
her
wedding
outfit
we
begin
by
ruining
ourselves
she
said
in
a
tone
true
for
all
my
back
pay
is
there
replied
luigi
i
have
mortgaged
it
to
a
worthy
fellow
named
why
did
you
do
so
she
said
in
a
tone
of
reproach
through
which
could
be
heard
her
inward
satisfaction
do
you
believe
i
should
be
less
happy
in
a
garret
but
she
added
it
is
all
charming
and
it
is
ours
luigi
looked
at
her
with
such
enthusiasm
that
she
lowered
her
eyes
now
let
us
see
the
rest
she
cried
above
these
three
rooms
under
the
roof
was
a
study
for
luigi
a
kitchen
and
a
servant
ginevra
was
much
pleased
with
her
little
domain
although
the
view
from
the
windows
was
limited
by
the
high
wall
of
a
neighboring
house
and
the
from
which
their
light
was
derived
was
gloomy
but
the
two
lovers
were
so
happy
in
heart
hope
so
adorned
their
future
that
they
chose
to
see
nothing
but
what
was
charming
in
their
hidden
nest
they
were
there
in
that
vast
house
lost
in
the
immensity
of
paris
like
two
pearls
in
their
shell
in
the
depths
of
ocean
to
all
others
it
might
have
seemed
a
prison
to
them
it
was
paradise
the
first
few
days
of
their
union
were
given
to
love
the
effort
to
turn
at
once
to
work
was
too
difficult
they
could
not
resist
the
charm
of
their
own
passion
luigi
lay
for
hours
at
the
feet
of
his
wife
admiring
the
color
of
her
hair
the
moulding
of
her
forehead
the
enchanting
socket
of
her
eyes
the
purity
and
whiteness
of
the
two
arches
beneath
which
the
eyes
themselves
turned
slowly
expressing
the
happiness
of
a
satisfied
love
ginevra
caressed
the
hair
of
her
luigi
never
weary
of
gazing
at
what
she
called
his
belta
folgorante
and
the
delicacy
of
his
features
she
was
constantly
charmed
by
the
nobility
of
his
manners
as
she
herself
attracted
him
by
the
grace
of
hers
they
played
together
like
children
with
nothings
nothings
that
brought
them
ever
back
to
their
love
ceasing
their
play
only
to
fall
into
a
revery
of
the
far
an
air
sung
by
ginevra
reproduced
to
their
souls
the
enchanting
lights
and
shadows
of
their
passion
together
uniting
their
steps
as
they
did
their
souls
they
roamed
about
the
country
finding
everywhere
their
love
in
the
flowers
in
the
sky
in
the
glowing
tints
of
the
setting
sun
they
read
it
in
even
the
capricious
vapors
which
met
and
struggled
in
the
ether
each
day
resembled
in
nothing
its
predecessors
their
love
increased
and
still
increased
because
it
was
a
true
love
they
had
tested
each
other
in
what
seemed
only
a
short
time
and
instinctively
they
recognized
that
their
souls
were
of
a
kind
whose
inexhaustible
riches
promised
for
the
future
unceasing
joys
theirs
was
love
in
all
its
artlessness
with
its
interminable
conversations
unfinished
speeches
long
silences
oriental
reposes
and
oriental
ardor
luigi
and
ginevra
comprehended
love
love
is
like
the
ocean
seen
superficially
or
in
haste
it
is
called
monotonous
by
common
souls
whereas
some
privileged
beings
can
pass
their
lives
in
admiring
it
and
in
finding
ceaselessly
the
varying
phenomena
that
enchant
them
soon
however
prudence
and
foresight
drew
the
young
couple
from
their
eden
it
was
necessary
to
work
to
live
ginevra
who
possessed
a
special
talent
for
imitating
old
paintings
took
up
the
business
of
copying
and
soon
found
many
customers
among
the
luigi
on
his
side
sought
long
and
actively
for
occupation
but
it
was
hard
for
a
young
officer
whose
talents
had
been
restricted
to
the
study
of
strategy
to
find
anything
to
do
in
paris
at
last
weary
of
vain
efforts
his
soul
filled
with
despair
at
seeing
the
whole
burden
of
their
subsistence
falling
on
ginevra
it
occurred
to
him
to
make
use
of
his
handwriting
which
was
excellent
with
a
persistency
of
which
he
saw
an
example
in
his
wife
he
went
round
among
the
layers
and
notaries
of
paris
asking
for
papers
to
copy
the
frankness
of
his
manners
and
his
situation
interested
many
in
his
favor
he
soon
obtained
enough
work
to
be
obliged
to
find
young
men
to
assist
him
and
this
employment
became
little
by
little
a
regular
business
the
profits
of
his
office
and
the
sale
of
ginevra
s
pictures
gave
the
young
couple
a
competence
of
which
they
were
justly
proud
for
it
was
the
fruit
of
their
industry
this
to
the
busy
pair
was
the
happiest
period
of
their
lives
the
days
flowed
rapidly
by
filled
with
occupation
and
the
joys
of
their
love
at
night
after
working
all
day
they
met
with
delight
in
ginevra
s
studio
music
refreshed
their
weariness
no
expression
of
regret
or
melancholy
obscured
the
happy
features
of
the
young
wife
and
never
did
she
utter
a
complaint
she
appeared
to
her
luigi
with
a
smile
upon
her
lips
and
her
eyes
beaming
each
cherished
a
ruling
thought
which
would
have
made
them
take
pleasure
in
a
labor
still
more
severe
ginevra
said
in
her
heart
that
she
worked
for
luigi
and
luigi
the
same
for
ginevra
sometimes
in
the
absence
of
her
husband
the
thought
of
the
perfect
happiness
she
might
have
had
if
this
life
of
love
could
have
been
lived
in
the
presence
of
her
father
and
mother
overcame
the
young
wife
and
then
as
she
felt
the
full
power
of
remorse
she
dropped
into
melancholy
mournful
pictures
passed
like
shadows
across
her
imagination
she
saw
her
old
father
alone
or
her
mother
weeping
in
secret
lest
the
inexorable
piombo
should
perceive
her
tears
the
two
white
solemn
heads
rose
suddenly
before
her
and
the
thought
came
that
never
again
should
she
see
them
except
in
memory
this
thought
pursued
her
like
a
presentiment
she
celebrated
the
anniversary
of
her
marriage
by
giving
her
husband
a
portrait
he
had
long
desired
that
of
his
ginevra
painted
by
herself
never
had
the
young
artist
done
so
remarkable
a
work
aside
from
the
resemblance
the
glow
of
her
beauty
the
purity
of
her
feelings
the
happiness
of
love
were
there
depicted
by
a
sort
of
magic
this
masterpiece
of
her
art
and
her
joy
was
a
votive
offering
to
their
wedded
felicity
another
year
of
ease
and
comfort
went
by
the
history
of
their
life
may
be
given
in
three
words
were
no
event
happened
to
them
of
sufficient
importance
to
be
recorded
chapter
vi
retribution
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
the
requested
ginevra
to
give
them
something
beside
copies
for
competition
had
so
increased
that
they
could
no
longer
sell
her
work
to
advantage
madame
porta
then
perceived
the
mistake
she
had
made
in
not
exercising
her
talent
for
genre
painting
which
might
by
this
time
have
brought
her
reputation
she
now
attempted
but
here
she
was
forced
to
compete
against
a
crowd
of
artists
in
greater
need
of
money
than
herself
however
as
luigi
and
ginevra
had
laid
by
a
few
savings
they
were
not
as
yet
uneasy
about
the
future
toward
the
end
of
the
winter
of
that
year
luigi
worked
without
intermission
he
too
was
struggling
against
competitors
the
payment
for
writing
had
so
decreased
that
he
found
it
impossible
to
employ
assistance
he
was
forced
therefore
to
work
a
much
longer
time
himself
to
obtain
the
same
emolument
his
wife
had
finished
several
pictures
which
were
not
without
merit
but
the
dealers
were
scarcely
buying
those
of
artists
with
reputations
consequently
her
paintings
had
little
chance
ginevra
offered
them
for
almost
nothing
but
without
success
the
situation
of
the
household
now
began
to
be
alarming
the
souls
of
the
husband
and
wife
floated
on
the
ocean
of
their
happiness
love
overwhelmed
them
with
its
treasures
while
poverty
rose
like
a
skeleton
amid
their
harvest
of
joy
yet
all
the
while
they
hid
from
each
other
their
secret
anxiety
when
ginevra
felt
like
weeping
as
she
watched
luigi
s
worn
and
suffering
face
she
redoubled
her
caresses
and
luigi
keeping
his
dark
forebodings
in
the
depths
of
his
soul
expressed
to
his
ginevra
the
tenderest
love
they
sought
a
compensation
for
their
troubles
in
exalting
their
feelings
and
their
words
their
joys
their
caresses
became
suffused
as
it
were
with
a
species
of
frenzy
they
feared
the
future
what
feeling
can
be
compared
in
strength
with
that
of
a
passion
which
may
cease
on
the
morrow
killed
by
death
or
want
when
they
talked
together
of
their
poverty
each
felt
the
necessity
of
deceiving
the
other
and
they
fastened
with
mutual
ardor
on
the
slightest
hope
one
night
ginevra
woke
and
missed
luigi
from
her
side
she
rose
in
terror
a
faint
light
shining
on
the
opposite
wall
of
the
little
revealed
to
her
that
her
husband
was
working
in
his
study
at
night
luigi
was
now
in
the
habit
of
waiting
till
his
wife
was
asleep
and
then
going
up
to
his
garret
to
write
four
o
clock
struck
ginevra
lay
down
again
and
pretended
to
sleep
presently
luigi
returned
overcome
with
fatigue
and
drowsiness
ginevra
looked
sadly
on
the
beautiful
worn
face
where
toil
and
care
were
already
drawing
lines
of
wrinkles
it
is
for
me
he
spends
his
nights
in
writing
she
said
to
herself
weeping
a
thought
dried
her
tears
she
would
imitate
luigi
that
same
day
she
went
to
a
and
by
help
of
a
letter
of
recommendation
she
had
obtained
from
elie
magus
one
of
her
she
obtained
an
order
for
the
coloring
of
lithographs
during
the
day
she
painted
her
pictures
and
attended
to
the
cares
of
the
household
then
when
night
came
she
colored
the
engravings
this
loving
couple
entered
their
nuptial
bed
only
to
deceive
each
other
both
feigned
sleep
and
left
it
luigi
as
soon
as
he
thought
his
wife
was
sleeping
ginevra
as
soon
as
he
had
gone
one
night
luigi
burning
with
a
sort
of
fever
induced
by
a
toil
under
which
his
strength
was
beginning
to
give
way
opened
the
casement
of
his
garret
to
breathe
the
morning
air
and
shake
off
for
a
moment
the
burden
of
his
care
happening
to
glance
downward
he
saw
the
reflection
of
ginevra
s
lamp
on
the
opposite
wall
and
the
poor
fellow
guessed
the
truth
he
went
down
stepping
softly
and
surprised
his
wife
in
her
studio
coloring
engravings
oh
ginevra
he
cried
she
gave
a
convulsive
bound
in
her
chair
and
blushed
could
i
sleep
while
you
were
wearing
yourself
out
with
toil
she
said
but
to
me
alone
belongs
the
right
to
work
in
this
way
he
answered
could
i
be
idle
she
asked
her
eyes
filling
with
tears
when
i
know
that
every
mouthful
we
eat
costs
a
drop
of
your
blood
i
should
die
if
i
could
not
add
my
efforts
to
yours
all
should
be
in
common
between
us
pains
and
pleasures
she
is
cold
cried
luigi
in
despair
wrap
your
shawl
closer
round
you
my
own
ginevra
the
night
is
damp
and
they
went
to
the
window
the
young
wife
leaning
on
the
breast
of
her
beloved
who
held
her
round
the
waist
and
together
in
deep
silence
they
gazed
upward
at
the
sky
which
the
dawn
was
slowly
brightening
clouds
of
a
grayish
hue
were
moving
rapidly
the
east
was
growing
luminous
see
said
ginevra
it
is
an
omen
we
shall
be
yes
in
heaven
replied
luigi
with
a
bitter
smile
oh
ginevra
you
who
deserved
all
the
treasures
upon
earth
i
have
your
heart
she
said
in
tones
of
joy
ah
i
complain
no
more
he
answered
straining
her
tightly
to
him
and
covering
with
kisses
the
delicate
face
which
was
losing
the
freshness
of
youth
though
its
expression
was
still
so
soft
so
tender
that
he
could
not
look
at
it
and
not
be
comforted
what
silence
said
ginevra
presently
dear
friend
i
take
great
pleasure
in
sitting
up
the
majesty
of
night
is
so
contagious
it
awes
it
inspires
there
is
i
know
not
what
great
power
in
the
thought
all
sleep
i
oh
my
ginevra
he
cried
it
is
not
alone
i
feel
how
delicately
moulded
is
your
soul
but
see
the
dawn
is
shining
come
and
yes
replied
ginevra
if
i
do
not
sleep
alone
i
suffered
too
much
that
night
i
first
discovered
that
you
were
waking
while
i
the
courage
with
which
these
two
young
people
fought
with
misery
received
for
a
while
its
due
reward
but
an
event
which
usually
crowns
the
happiness
of
a
household
to
them
proved
fatal
ginevra
had
a
son
who
was
to
use
the
popular
expression
as
beautiful
as
the
the
sense
of
motherhood
doubled
the
strength
of
the
young
wife
luigi
borrowed
money
to
meet
the
expenses
of
ginevra
s
confinement
at
first
she
did
not
feel
the
fresh
burden
of
their
situation
and
the
pair
gave
themselves
wholly
up
to
the
joy
of
possessing
a
child
it
was
their
last
happiness
like
two
swimmers
uniting
their
efforts
to
breast
a
current
these
two
corsican
souls
struggled
courageously
but
sometimes
they
gave
way
to
an
apathy
which
resembled
the
sleep
that
precedes
death
soon
they
were
obliged
to
sell
their
jewels
poverty
appeared
to
them
suddenly
not
hideous
but
plainly
clothed
almost
easy
to
endure
its
voice
had
nothing
terrifying
with
it
came
neither
spectres
nor
despair
nor
rags
but
it
made
them
lose
the
memory
and
the
habits
of
comfort
it
dried
the
springs
of
pride
then
before
they
knew
it
came
want
want
in
all
its
horror
indifferent
to
its
rags
treading
underfoot
all
human
sentiments
seven
or
eight
months
after
the
birth
of
the
little
bartolomeo
it
would
have
been
hard
to
see
in
the
mother
who
suckled
her
sickly
babe
the
original
of
the
beautiful
portrait
the
sole
remaining
ornament
of
the
squalid
home
without
fire
through
a
hard
winter
the
graceful
outlines
of
ginevra
s
figure
were
slowly
destroyed
her
cheeks
grew
white
as
porcelain
and
her
eyes
dulled
as
though
the
springs
of
life
were
drying
up
within
her
watching
her
shrunken
discolored
child
she
felt
no
suffering
but
for
that
young
misery
and
luigi
had
no
courage
to
smile
upon
his
son
i
have
wandered
over
paris
he
said
one
day
i
know
no
one
can
i
ask
help
of
strangers
vergniaud
my
old
sergeant
is
concerned
in
a
conspiracy
and
they
have
put
him
in
prison
besides
he
has
already
lent
me
all
he
could
spare
as
for
our
landlord
it
is
over
a
year
since
he
asked
me
for
any
but
we
are
not
in
want
replied
ginevra
gently
affecting
calmness
every
hour
brings
some
new
difficulty
continued
luigi
in
a
tone
of
terror
another
day
luigi
took
ginevra
s
pictures
her
portrait
and
the
few
articles
of
furniture
which
they
could
still
exist
without
and
sold
them
for
a
miserable
sum
which
prolonged
the
agony
of
the
hapless
household
for
a
time
during
these
days
of
wretchedness
ginevra
showed
the
sublimity
of
her
nature
and
the
extent
of
her
resignation
stoically
she
bore
the
strokes
of
misery
her
strong
soul
held
her
up
against
all
woes
she
worked
with
unfaltering
hand
beside
her
dying
son
performed
her
household
duties
with
marvellous
activity
and
sufficed
for
all
she
was
even
happy
still
when
she
saw
on
luigi
s
lips
a
smile
of
surprise
at
the
cleanliness
she
produced
in
the
one
poor
room
where
they
had
taken
refuge
dear
i
kept
this
bit
of
bread
for
you
she
said
one
evening
when
he
returned
and
you
i
i
have
dined
dear
luigi
i
want
nothing
and
the
tender
look
on
her
beseeching
face
urged
him
more
than
her
words
to
take
the
food
of
which
she
had
deprived
herself
luigi
kissed
her
with
one
of
those
kisses
of
despair
that
were
given
in
between
friends
as
they
mounted
the
scaffold
in
such
supreme
moments
two
beings
see
each
other
heart
to
heart
the
hapless
luigi
comprehending
suddenly
that
his
wife
was
starving
was
seized
with
the
fever
which
consumed
her
he
shuddered
and
went
out
pretending
that
some
business
called
him
for
he
would
rather
have
drunk
the
deadliest
poison
than
escape
death
by
eating
that
last
morsel
of
bread
that
was
left
in
his
home
he
wandered
wildly
about
paris
amid
the
gorgeous
equipages
in
the
bosom
of
that
flaunting
luxury
that
displays
itself
everywhere
he
hurried
past
the
windows
of
the
where
gold
was
glittering
and
at
last
he
resolved
to
sell
himself
to
be
a
substitute
for
military
service
hoping
that
this
sacrifice
would
save
ginevra
and
that
her
father
during
his
absence
would
take
her
home
he
went
to
one
of
those
agents
who
manage
these
transactions
and
felt
a
sort
of
happiness
in
recognizing
an
old
officer
of
the
imperial
guard
it
is
two
days
since
i
have
eaten
anything
he
said
to
him
in
a
slow
weak
voice
my
wife
is
dying
of
hunger
and
has
never
uttered
one
word
of
complaint
she
will
die
smiling
i
think
for
god
s
sake
comrade
he
added
bitterly
buy
me
in
advance
i
am
robust
i
am
no
longer
in
the
service
and
i
the
officer
gave
luigi
a
sum
on
account
of
that
which
he
promised
to
procure
for
him
the
wretched
man
laughed
convulsively
as
he
grasped
the
gold
and
ran
with
all
his
might
breathless
to
his
home
crying
out
at
times
ginevra
oh
my
ginevra
it
was
almost
night
when
he
reached
his
wretched
room
he
entered
very
softly
fearing
to
cause
too
strong
an
emotion
to
his
wife
whom
he
had
left
so
weak
the
last
rays
of
the
sun
entering
through
the
garret
window
were
fading
from
ginevra
s
face
as
she
sat
sleeping
in
her
chair
and
holding
her
child
upon
her
breast
wake
my
dear
one
he
said
not
observing
the
infant
which
shone
at
that
moment
with
supernatural
light
hearing
that
voice
the
poor
mother
opened
her
eyes
met
luigi
s
look
and
smiled
but
luigi
himself
gave
a
cry
of
horror
he
scarcely
recognized
his
wife
now
half
mad
with
a
gesture
of
savage
energy
he
showed
her
the
gold
ginevra
began
to
laugh
mechanically
but
suddenly
she
cried
in
a
dreadful
voice
the
child
luigi
he
is
cold
she
looked
at
her
son
and
swooned
the
little
bartolomeo
was
dead
luigi
took
his
wife
in
his
arms
without
removing
the
child
which
she
clasped
with
inconceivable
force
and
after
laying
her
on
the
bed
he
went
out
to
seek
help
oh
my
god
he
said
as
he
met
his
landlord
on
the
stairs
i
have
gold
gold
and
my
child
has
died
of
hunger
and
his
mother
is
dying
too
help
me
he
returned
like
one
distraught
to
his
wife
leaving
the
worthy
mason
and
also
the
neighbors
who
heard
him
to
gather
a
few
things
for
the
needs
of
so
terrible
a
want
hitherto
unknown
for
the
two
corsicans
had
carefully
hidden
it
from
a
feeling
of
pride
luigi
had
cast
his
gold
upon
the
floor
and
was
kneeling
by
the
bed
on
which
lay
his
wife
father
take
care
of
my
son
who
bears
your
name
she
was
saying
in
her
delirium
oh
my
angel
be
calm
said
luigi
kissing
her
our
good
days
are
coming
back
to
my
luigi
she
said
looking
at
him
with
extraordinary
attention
listen
to
me
i
feel
that
i
am
dying
my
death
is
natural
i
suffered
too
much
besides
a
happiness
so
great
as
mine
has
to
be
paid
for
yes
my
luigi
be
comforted
i
have
been
so
happy
that
if
i
were
to
live
again
i
would
again
accept
our
fate
i
am
a
bad
mother
i
regret
you
more
than
i
regret
my
child
my
child
she
added
in
a
hollow
voice
two
tears
escaped
her
dying
eyes
and
suddenly
she
pressed
the
little
body
she
had
no
power
to
warm
give
my
hair
to
my
father
in
memory
of
his
ginevra
she
said
tell
him
i
have
never
blamed
her
head
fell
upon
her
husband
s
arm
no
you
can
not
die
cried
luigi
the
doctor
is
coming
we
have
food
your
father
will
take
you
home
prosperity
is
here
stay
with
us
angel
but
the
faithful
heart
so
full
of
love
was
growing
cold
ginevra
turned
her
eyes
instinctively
to
him
she
loved
though
she
was
conscious
of
nought
else
confused
images
passed
before
her
mind
now
losing
memory
of
earth
she
knew
that
luigi
was
there
for
she
clasped
his
icy
hand
tightly
and
more
tightly
still
as
though
she
strove
to
save
herself
from
some
precipice
down
which
she
feared
to
fall
dear
she
said
at
last
you
are
cold
i
will
warm
she
tried
to
put
his
hand
upon
her
heart
but
died
two
doctors
a
priest
and
several
neighbors
came
into
the
room
bringing
all
that
was
necessary
to
save
the
poor
couple
and
calm
their
despair
these
strangers
made
some
noise
in
entering
but
after
they
had
entered
an
awful
silence
filled
the
room
while
that
scene
was
taking
place
bartolomeo
and
his
wife
were
sitting
in
their
antique
chairs
each
at
a
corner
of
the
vast
fireplace
where
a
glowing
fire
scarcely
warmed
the
great
spaces
of
their
salon
the
clock
told
midnight
for
some
time
past
the
old
couple
had
lost
the
ability
to
sleep
at
the
present
moment
they
sat
there
silent
like
two
persons
in
their
dotage
gazing
about
them
at
things
they
did
not
see
their
deserted
salon
so
filled
with
memories
to
them
was
feebly
lighted
by
a
single
lamp
which
seemed
expiring
without
the
sparkling
of
the
flame
upon
the
hearth
they
might
soon
have
been
in
total
darkness
a
friend
had
just
left
them
and
the
chair
on
which
he
had
been
sitting
remained
where
he
left
it
between
the
two
corsicans
piombo
was
casting
glances
at
that
chair
glances
full
of
thoughts
crowding
one
upon
another
like
remorse
for
the
empty
chair
was
ginevra
s
elisa
piombo
watched
the
expressions
that
now
began
to
cross
her
husband
s
pallid
face
though
long
accustomed
to
divine
his
feelings
from
the
changeful
agitations
of
his
face
they
seemed
so
threatening
and
anon
so
melancholy
that
she
felt
she
could
no
longer
read
a
soul
that
was
now
incomprehensible
even
to
her
would
bartolomeo
yield
at
last
to
the
memories
awakened
by
that
chair
had
he
been
shocked
to
see
a
stranger
in
that
chair
used
for
the
first
time
since
his
daughter
left
him
had
the
hour
of
his
mercy
struck
that
hour
she
had
vainly
prayed
and
waited
for
till
now
these
reflections
shook
the
mother
s
heart
successively
for
an
instant
her
husband
s
countenance
became
so
terrible
that
she
trembled
at
having
used
this
simple
means
to
bring
about
a
mention
of
ginevra
s
name
the
night
was
wintry
the
north
wind
drove
the
snowflakes
so
sharply
against
the
blinds
that
the
old
couple
fancied
that
they
heard
a
gentle
rustling
ginevra
s
mother
dropped
her
head
to
hide
her
tears
suddenly
a
sigh
burst
from
the
old
man
s
breast
his
wife
looked
at
him
he
seemed
to
her
crushed
then
she
risked
speaking
for
the
second
time
in
three
long
years
of
his
daughter
ginevra
may
be
cold
she
said
softly
piombo
quivered
she
may
be
hungry
she
continued
the
old
man
dropped
a
tear
perhaps
she
has
a
child
and
can
not
suckle
it
her
milk
is
dried
up
said
the
mother
in
accents
of
despair
let
her
come
let
her
come
to
me
cried
piombo
oh
my
precious
child
thou
hast
conquered
the
mother
rose
as
if
to
fetch
her
daughter
at
that
instant
the
door
opened
noisily
and
a
man
whose
face
no
longer
bore
the
semblance
of
humanity
stood
suddenly
before
them
dead
our
two
families
were
doomed
to
exterminate
each
other
here
is
all
that
remains
of
her
he
said
laying
ginevra
s
long
black
hair
upon
the
table
the
old
people
shook
and
quivered
as
if
a
stroke
of
lightning
had
blasted
them
luigi
no
longer
stood
before
them
he
has
spared
me
a
shot
for
he
is
dead
said
bartolomeo
slowly
gazing
on
the
ground
at
his
feet
