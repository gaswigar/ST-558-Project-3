poems
by
a
little
girl
by
hilda
conkling
with
a
preface
by
amy
lowell
for
you
mother
i
have
a
dream
for
you
mother
like
a
soft
thick
fringe
to
hide
your
eyes
i
have
a
surprise
for
you
mother
shaped
like
a
strange
butterfly
i
have
found
a
way
of
thinking
to
make
you
happy
i
have
made
a
song
and
a
poem
all
twisted
into
one
if
i
sing
you
listen
if
i
think
you
know
i
have
a
secret
from
everybody
in
the
world
full
of
people
but
i
can
not
always
remember
how
it
goes
it
is
a
song
for
you
mother
with
a
curl
of
cloud
and
a
feather
of
blue
and
a
mist
blowing
along
the
sky
if
i
sing
it
some
day
under
my
voice
will
it
make
you
happy
thanks
are
due
to
the
editors
of
poetry
a
magazine
of
verse
the
delineator
good
housekeeping
the
lyric
nicholas
and
contemporary
verse
for
their
courteous
permission
to
reprint
many
of
the
following
poems
preface
a
book
which
needs
to
be
written
is
one
dealing
with
the
childhood
of
authors
it
would
be
not
only
interesting
but
instructive
not
merely
profitable
in
a
general
way
but
practical
in
a
particular
we
might
hope
in
reading
it
to
gain
some
sort
of
knowledge
as
to
what
environments
and
conditions
are
most
conducive
to
the
growth
of
the
creative
faculty
we
might
even
learn
how
not
to
strangle
this
rare
faculty
in
its
early
years
at
this
moment
i
am
faced
with
a
difficult
task
for
here
is
an
author
and
her
childhood
in
a
most
unusual
position
these
two
conditions
that
of
being
an
author
and
that
of
being
a
child
appear
simultaneously
instead
of
in
the
due
order
to
which
we
are
accustomed
for
i
wish
at
the
outset
to
state
and
emphatically
that
it
is
poetry
the
stuff
and
essence
of
poetry
which
this
book
contains
i
know
of
no
other
instance
in
which
such
really
beautiful
poetry
has
been
written
by
a
child
but
confronted
with
so
unwonted
a
state
of
things
two
questions
obtrude
themselves
how
far
has
the
condition
of
childhood
been
impaired
by
not
only
the
possession
but
the
expression
of
the
gift
of
writing
how
far
has
the
condition
of
authorship
at
least
in
its
more
mature
state
still
to
come
been
hampered
by
this
early
leap
into
the
light
the
first
question
concerns
the
little
girl
and
can
best
be
answered
by
herself
some
twenty
years
hence
the
second
concerns
the
world
and
again
the
answer
must
wait
we
can
however
do
something
we
can
see
what
she
is
and
what
she
has
done
and
if
the
one
is
interesting
to
the
psychologist
the
other
is
no
less
important
to
the
poet
hilda
conkling
is
the
younger
daughter
of
grace
hazard
conkling
assistant
professor
of
english
at
smith
college
northampton
massachusetts
at
the
time
of
writing
hilda
has
just
passed
her
ninth
birthday
her
sister
elsa
is
two
years
her
senior
the
children
and
their
mother
live
all
the
year
round
in
northampton
and
glimpses
of
the
woods
and
hills
surrounding
the
little
town
crop
up
again
and
again
in
these
poems
this
is
emily
dickinson
country
and
there
is
a
reminiscent
sameness
in
the
fauna
and
flora
of
her
poems
in
these
the
two
little
girls
go
to
a
school
a
few
blocks
from
where
they
live
in
the
afternoons
they
take
long
walks
with
their
mother
or
play
in
the
garden
while
she
writes
on
rainy
days
there
are
books
and
conkling
piano
which
is
not
just
a
piano
for
conkling
is
a
musician
and
we
may
imagine
that
the
children
hear
a
special
music
as
they
certainly
read
a
special
literature
by
special
i
do
not
mean
a
prescribed
course
for
dietitians
of
the
mind
are
quite
as
apt
to
be
faddists
as
dietitians
of
the
stomach
but
just
that
sort
of
reading
which
a
person
who
passionately
loves
books
would
most
want
to
introduce
her
children
to
and
here
i
think
we
have
the
answer
to
the
why
of
hilda
she
and
her
sister
have
been
their
mother
close
companions
ever
since
they
were
born
they
have
never
known
that
somewhat
equivocal
relationship
a
child
with
its
nurse
they
have
never
been
for
hours
at
a
time
in
contact
with
an
elementary
intelligence
if
hilda
had
shown
these
poems
to
even
the
most
sympathetic
nurse
what
would
have
been
the
result
in
the
first
place
they
would
in
all
probability
have
been
lost
since
hilda
does
not
write
her
poems
but
tells
them
in
the
second
they
would
have
been
either
extravagantly
praised
or
laughingly
commented
upon
in
either
case
the
fine
flower
of
creation
would
most
certainly
have
been
injured
then
again
blessed
though
many
of
the
nurses
of
childhood
undoubtedly
are
and
we
all
remember
them
they
have
no
means
of
answering
the
thousand
and
one
questions
of
an
eager
opening
mind
to
be
an
adequate
companion
to
childhood
one
must
know
so
many
things
hilda
is
fortunate
in
her
mother
for
if
these
poems
reveal
one
thing
more
than
another
it
is
that
conkling
is
dowered
with
an
admirable
tact
in
the
dedication
poem
to
her
mother
the
little
girl
says
if
i
sing
you
listen
if
i
think
you
know
no
finer
tribute
could
be
offered
by
one
person
to
another
than
the
contented
certainty
of
understanding
in
those
two
lines
hilda
tells
her
poems
and
the
method
of
it
is
this
they
come
out
in
the
course
of
conversation
and
conkling
is
so
often
engaged
in
writing
that
there
is
nothing
to
be
remarked
if
she
scribbles
absently
while
talking
to
the
little
girls
but
this
scribbling
is
really
a
complete
draught
of
the
poem
occasionally
conkling
writes
down
the
poem
later
from
memory
and
reads
it
afterwards
to
the
child
who
always
remembers
if
it
is
not
exactly
in
its
original
form
no
line
no
cadence
is
altered
from
hilda
version
the
titles
have
been
added
for
convenience
but
they
are
merely
obvious
handles
derived
from
the
text
naturally
it
is
only
a
small
proportion
of
hilda
life
which
is
given
to
poetry
much
is
devoted
to
running
about
a
part
to
study
etc
it
is
however
significant
that
hilda
is
not
very
keen
about
games
with
other
children
not
that
she
is
by
any
means
either
shy
or
solitary
but
they
do
not
greatly
interest
her
doubtless
childhood
pays
its
debt
of
possession
more
steadily
than
we
know
now
to
turn
to
the
book
itself
at
the
very
start
here
is
an
amazing
thing
this
slim
volume
contains
one
hundred
and
seven
separate
poems
and
that
is
counting
as
one
all
the
very
short
pieces
written
between
the
ages
of
five
and
six
certainly
that
is
a
remarkable
output
for
a
little
girl
and
the
only
possible
explanation
is
that
the
poems
are
perfectly
instinctive
there
is
no
working
over
as
with
an
adult
poet
hilda
is
subconscious
not
her
mother
says
that
she
rarely
hesitates
for
a
word
when
the
feeling
is
strong
it
speaks
for
itself
read
the
dedication
poem
for
you
mother
it
is
full
of
feeling
and
of
that
simple
dignified
adequate
diction
which
is
the
speech
of
feeling
i
have
found
a
way
of
thinking
to
make
you
happy
that
is
beautiful
and
once
read
inevitable
but
it
waited
for
a
child
to
say
poem
after
poem
is
charged
with
this
feeling
this
expression
of
great
love
i
will
sing
you
a
song
with
love
in
it
how
i
love
you
will
you
love
me
after
next
as
if
i
had
a
bird
way
of
singing
but
it
is
not
only
the
pulse
of
feeling
in
such
passages
which
makes
them
surprising
it
is
the
perfectly
original
expression
of
it
when
one
reads
a
thing
and
voluntarily
exclaims
how
beautiful
how
natural
how
true
then
one
knows
that
one
has
stumbled
upon
that
flash
of
personality
which
we
call
genius
these
poems
are
full
of
such
flashes
sparkle
up
little
tired
flower
leaning
in
the
grass
there
is
a
star
that
runs
very
fast
that
goes
pulling
the
moon
through
the
tops
of
the
poplars
there
is
sweetness
in
the
tree
and
fireflies
are
counting
the
leaves
i
like
this
country
i
like
the
way
it
has
a
pansy
has
a
thinking
face
a
rooster
has
a
comb
gay
as
a
parade
he
shouts
crooked
words
loud
sharp
not
beautiful
frozen
water
is
asked
if
it
can
not
lift
itself
with
sun
and
easter
morning
says
a
glad
thing
over
and
over
no
matter
who
wrote
them
those
passages
would
be
beautiful
the
oldest
poet
in
the
world
could
not
improve
upon
them
and
yet
the
reader
has
only
to
turn
to
the
text
to
see
the
incredibly
early
age
at
which
such
expressions
came
into
the
author
mind
where
childhood
betrays
genius
is
in
the
mounting
up
of
detail
inadequate
lines
not
infrequently
jar
a
total
effect
as
when
in
the
poem
of
the
star
pulling
the
moon
she
suddenly
ends
mr
moon
does
he
make
you
hurry
or
speaking
of
a
drop
of
water
so
it
went
on
with
its
life
for
several
years
until
at
last
it
was
never
heard
of
any
more
this
is
the
perennial
child
thinking
as
children
think
and
we
are
glad
of
it
it
makes
the
whole
more
healthy
more
sure
of
development
when
the
subconscious
mind
of
hilda
conkling
takes
a
vacation
she
does
not
nod
as
erstwhile
homer
she
merely
reverts
to
type
and
is
a
child
again
i
think
too
highly
of
these
poems
to
speak
of
the
volume
as
though
it
were
the
finished
achievement
of
a
person
some
of
the
poems
can
be
taken
in
that
way
but
by
no
means
all
the
child
who
writes
them
frequently
transcends
herself
but
her
thoughts
for
the
most
part
are
those
proper
to
every
imaginative
child
fairies
play
a
large
role
in
her
fancies
and
so
does
the
sandman
there
are
kings
and
princesses
and
golden
wings
and
there
are
reminiscences
of
and
hints
of
pictures
that
have
pleased
her
after
all
that
is
the
way
we
all
make
our
poems
but
the
poet
tries
to
get
away
from
his
author
he
tries
to
see
more
than
the
painter
has
seen
the
little
girl
is
quite
untroubled
by
any
questions
of
technique
she
takes
what
to
her
is
the
obvious
always
and
in
these
copied
pieces
it
is
naturally
less
her
own
peculiar
obvious
than
in
the
nature
poems
hilda
conkling
is
evidently
possessed
of
a
rare
and
accurate
power
of
observation
and
when
we
add
this
to
her
gift
of
imagination
we
see
that
it
is
the
perfectly
natural
play
of
these
two
faculties
which
makes
what
to
her
is
an
obvious
expression
she
does
not
search
for
it
it
is
her
natural
mode
of
thought
but
luckily
for
her
she
has
been
guided
by
a
wisdom
which
has
not
attempted
to
show
her
a
better
way
her
observation
has
been
carefully
but
unobtrusively
cultivated
her
imagination
has
been
stimulated
by
the
reading
of
excellent
books
but
both
these
lines
of
instruction
have
been
kept
apparently
apart
from
her
own
work
she
has
been
let
alone
there
she
has
been
taught
by
an
analogy
which
she
has
never
suspected
by
this
means
her
poetical
gift
has
functioned
happily
without
ever
for
a
moment
experiencing
the
tension
of
doubt
a
few
passages
will
serve
to
show
how
well
hilda
knows
how
to
use
her
eyes
the
water
came
in
with
a
wavy
look
like
a
spider
web
a
bluebird
has
a
back
like
a
feathered
sky
apostrophizing
a
mountain
she
writes
you
shine
like
a
lily
but
with
a
different
whiteness
she
asks
a
why
do
you
stand
on
the
air
and
no
sun
shining
she
hears
a
chickadee
far
off
i
hear
him
talking
the
way
smooth
bright
pebbles
drop
into
water
now
let
us
follow
her
a
step
farther
to
where
the
imagination
takes
a
firmer
hold
the
world
turns
softly
not
to
spill
its
lakes
and
rivers
the
water
is
held
in
its
arms
and
the
sky
is
held
in
the
water
school
lessons
and
a
reflection
in
a
pond
that
is
the
stuff
of
which
all
poetry
is
made
it
is
the
fusion
which
shows
the
quality
of
the
poet
turn
to
the
text
and
read
geography
really
this
is
an
extraordinary
child
it
is
pleasant
to
watch
her
with
the
artist
eagerness
intrigued
by
the
sounds
of
words
for
instance
silvery
lonesome
lapping
of
the
long
wave
again
enchanted
by
a
little
bell
of
rhyme
we
have
this
amusing
catalogue
that
is
the
conscious
hilda
the
gay
little
girl
but
it
shows
a
quick
ear
nevertheless
we
can
almost
hear
the
giggle
with
which
that
cauliflowers
came
out
usually
rhyme
does
not
appear
to
be
a
matter
of
moment
to
her
some
poets
think
in
rhyme
some
do
not
hilda
evidently
belongs
to
the
second
category
treasure
and
the
and
short
story
are
the
only
poems
in
the
book
which
seem
to
follow
a
clearly
rhymed
pattern
if
any
misguided
schoolmistress
had
ever
suggested
that
a
poem
should
have
rhyme
and
metre
this
book
would
never
have
been
told
in
moon
doves
however
there
is
a
distinctly
metrical
effect
without
rhyme
but
the
great
majority
of
the
poems
are
built
upon
cadence
and
the
subtlety
of
this
little
girl
cadences
are
a
delight
to
those
who
can
hear
them
doubtless
her
musical
inheritance
has
all
to
do
with
this
for
in
poem
after
poem
the
instinct
for
rhythm
is
unerring
so
constantly
is
this
the
case
that
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
point
out
particular
examples
i
may
however
name
as
two
of
her
best
for
other
qualities
as
well
gift
and
poems
the
latter
contains
two
of
her
quick
strokes
of
observation
and
comparison
the
morning
like
the
inside
of
a
and
she
herself
curled
in
the
dear
me
how
simple
these
poems
seem
when
you
read
them
done
but
try
to
write
something
new
about
a
dandelion
try
it
and
then
read
the
poem
of
that
name
here
it
is
charming
how
did
she
think
of
it
how
indeed
delightful
conceits
she
has
another
is
sun
flowers
but
how
comes
a
child
of
eight
to
prick
and
point
with
the
rapier
of
irony
for
it
is
nothing
less
than
irony
in
the
tower
and
the
falcon
did
she
quite
grasp
its
meaning
herself
we
may
doubt
it
in
this
poem
the
subconscious
is
very
much
on
the
job
to
my
thinking
the
most
successful
poems
in
the
book
and
now
i
mean
successful
from
a
standpoint
are
for
you
mother
red
rooster
gift
poems
dandelion
butterfly
weather
hills
and
geography
and
it
will
be
noticed
that
these
are
precisely
the
poems
which
must
have
sprung
from
actual
experience
they
are
not
the
book
poems
not
even
the
fairy
poems
they
are
the
records
of
reactions
from
actual
happenings
i
have
not
a
doubt
that
hilda
prefers
her
they
are
the
conscious
play
of
her
imagination
it
must
be
fun
to
make
them
ah
but
it
is
the
unconscious
with
which
we
are
most
concerned
those
very
poems
which
are
probably
to
her
the
least
interesting
are
the
ones
which
most
certainly
reveal
the
fulness
of
poetry
from
which
she
draws
she
probably
hardly
thought
at
all
so
natural
was
it
to
say
that
three
pinks
smell
like
more
of
them
in
a
blue
vase
but
the
expression
fills
the
air
with
so
strong
a
scent
that
no
superlative
could
increase
it
gift
is
a
lovely
poem
it
has
feeling
expression
originality
cadence
if
a
child
can
write
such
a
poem
at
eight
years
old
what
does
it
mean
that
depends
i
think
on
how
long
the
instructors
of
youth
can
be
persuaded
to
keep
hands
off
a
period
of
imitation
is
i
fear
inevitable
but
if
consciousness
is
not
induced
by
direct
criticism
if
instruction
in
the
art
of
writing
is
abjured
the
imitative
period
will
probably
be
got
through
without
undue

i
think
there
is
too
much
native

here

the

full
of
flowers
all
dancing
round
and
round
they
dance
round
and
round
and
they
bow
down
and
down
to
a
daisy
vii
there
is
going
to
be
the
sound
of
bells
and
murmuring
this
is
the
brook

there
is
going

be
sound
of
voices
and
the

i
had
a
bird
way
of

five
to
six
years
old
garden
of
the
world
the
butterfly
swings
over
the
violet
that
stands
by
the
water
in
the
garden
that
sings
all
day
the
sun
goes
up
in
the
dawn
the
water
waves
softly
in
the
trees
are
little
breezes
in
the
garden
trees
blue
hills
and
blue
waters
i
the
big
blue
ocean
lies
around
in
the
sun
watching
his
waves
toss
eagles
were
flying
over
the
sky
and
mermaids
danced
in
the
gold
waters
eagles
were
calling
over
the
sky
and
the
water
was
the
color
of
blue
flowers
sunshine
was
in
the
waves
like
meadows
of
white
buds
this
is
what
i
saw
on
a
morning
long
ago
velvets
by
a
bed
of
pansies
this
pansy
has
a
thinking
face
like
the
yellow
moon
this
one
has
a
face
with
white
blots
i
call
him
the
clown
here
goes
one
down
the
grass
with
a
pretty
look
of
plumpness
she
is
a
little
girl
going
to
school
with
her
hands
in
the
pockets
of
her
pinafore
her
name
is
sue
i
like
this
one
in
a
bonnet
waiting
her
eyes
are
so
deep
but
these
on
the
other
side
these
that
wear
purple
and
blue
they
are
the
velvets
the
king
with
his
cloak
the
queen
with
her
gown
the
prince
with
his
feather
these
are
dark
and
quiet
and
stay
alone
i
know
you
velvets
color
of
dark
like
the
on
the
hill
when
stars
shine
two
songs
after
hearing
the
wagner
the
birds
came
to
tell
siegfried
a
story
a
story
of
the
woods
out
of
a
tree
how
the
ring
was
fairy
and
there
were
things
it
could
do
for
him
day
and
night
how
the
river
flowed
green
and
wavy
under
the
rainbow
bridge
and
brunnhilda
slept
in
a
wreath
of
fire
grane
watched
her
standing
close
beside
grane
the
big
white
horse
dear
grane
of
her
heart
she
dreamed
she
was
far
from
her
father
but
siegfried
was
coming
siegfried
through
the
big
trees
up
the
hill
through
the
fire
ii
siegfried
hear
us
give
us
back
the
ring
the
lady
with
the
shell
the
with
the
green
hair
calling
cried
siegfried
but
he
laughed
to
hear
her
laughed
in
the
sun
and
went
into
the
woods
laughing
he
was
happy
in
his
heart
and
he
had
golden
hair
till
the
sun
loved
him
siegfried
i
will
call
him
siegfried
but
he
will
not
hear
me
he
could
talk
to
birds
and
rivers
and
he
is
gone
moon
song
there
is
a
star
that
runs
very
fast
that
goes
pulling
the
moon
through
the
tops
of
the
poplars
it
is
all
in
silver
the
tall
star
the
moon
rolls
goldenly
along
out
of
breath
mr
moon
does
he
make
you
hurry
sunset
once
upon
a
time
at
a
little
girl
was
sad
there
was
a
color
in
the
sky
a
color
she
knew
in
her
dreamful
heart
and
wanted
to
keep
she
held
out
her
arms
long
long
and
saw
it
flow
away
on
the
wind
when
it
was
gone
she
did
not
love
the
moonlight
or
care
for
the
stars
she
had
seen
the
rose
in
the
sky
sometimes
i
am
sad
because
i
have
a
thought
of
this
little
girl
mouse
little
mouse
in
gray
velvet
have
you
had
a
there
are
no
crumbs
on
your
coat
did
you
use
a
napkin
i
wonder
what
you
had
to
eat
and
who
dresses
you
in
gray
velvet
short
story
i
found
the
gold
on
the
hill
i
found
the
hid
gold
the
wicked
queen
stole
the
gold
hid
it
under
a
stone
and
never
told
the
selfish
queen
rolling
away
in
her
white
limousine
never
knew
nor
dreamed
that
i
searched
all
day
till
i
found
the
gold
the
gold
by
lake
champlain
i
was
bare
as
a
leaf
and
i
felt
the
wind
on
my
shoulder
the
trees
laughed
when
i
picked
up
the
sun
in
my
fingers
the
wind
was
chasing
the
waves
tangling
their
white
curls
willow
trees
i
said
o
willows
look
at
your
lake
stop
laughing
at
a
little
girl
who
runs
past
your
feet
in
the
sand
spring
song
i
love
daffodils
i
love
narcissus
when
he
bends
his
head
i
can
hardly
keep
march
and
spring
and
sunday
and
daffodils
out
of
my
rhyme
of
song
do
you
know
anything
about
the
spring
when
it
comes
again
god
knows
about
it
while
winter
is
lasting
flowers
bring
him
power
in
the
spring
and
birds
bring
it
and
children
he
is
sometimes
sad
and
alone
up
there
in
the
sky
trying
to
keep
his
worlds
happy
i
bring
him
songs
when
he
is
in
his
sadness
and
weary
i
tell
him
how
i
used
to
wander
out
to
study
stars
and
the
moon
he
made
and
flowers
in
the
dark
of
the
wood
i
keep
reminding
him
about
his
flowers
he
has
forgotten
and
that
snowdrops
are
up
what
can
i
say
to
make
him
listen
god
i
say
do
you
care
nobody
must
be
sad
or
sorry
in
the
of
flowers
water
the
world
turns
softly
not
to
spill
its
lakes
and
rivers
the
water
is
held
in
its
arms
and
the
sky
is
held
in
the
water
what
is
water
that
pours
silver
and
can
hold
the
sky
shady
bronn
when
the
clouds
come
deep
against
the
sky
i
sit
alone
in
my
room
to
think
to
remember
the
fairy
dreams
i
made
listening
to
the
rustling
out
of
the
trees
the
stories
in
my
book
come
new
to
me
every
day
but
at
my
farm
on
the
i
have
the
wind
for
a
fairy
and
the
shapes
of
things
shady
bronn
is
the
name
of
my
little
farm
it
is
the
name
of
a
dream
i
have
where
leaves
move
and
the
wind
rings
them
like
little
bells
chickadee
the
chickadee
in
the
appletree
talks
all
the
time
very
gently
he
makes
me
sleepy
i
rock
away
to
the
far
off
i
hear
him
talking
the
way
smooth
bright
pebbles
drop
into
water
the
champlain
sandman
the
sandman
comes
pattering
across
the
bay
his
hair
is
silver
his
footstep
soft
the
moon
shines
on
his
silver
hair
on
his
quick
feet
the
sandman
comes
searching
across
the
bay
he
goes
to
all
the
houses
he
knows
to
put
sand
in
little
girls
eyes
that
is
why
i
go
to
my
sleepy
bed
and
why
the
leaves
the
moon
alone
there
are
no
wings
to
moonlight
any
more
only
the
sandman
hair
little
beside
the
stone
are
you
lonely
in
the
garden
there
are
no
friends
of
you
and
the
birds
are
gone
shall
i
pick
you
little
girl
up
by
the
hollyhock
i
am
not
lonely
i
feel
the
sun
burning
i
hold
light
in
my
cup
i
have
all
the
rain
i
want
i
think
things
to
myself
that
you
do
know
and
i
listen
to
the
talk
of
crickets
i
am
not
lonely
but
you
may
pick
me
and
take
me
to
your
mother
about
my
dreams
now
the
flowers
are
all
folded
and
the
dark
is
going
by
the
evening
is
arising
it
is
time
to
rest
when
i
am
sleeping
i
find
my
pillow
full
of
dreams
they
are
all
new
dreams
no
one
told
them
to
me
before
i
came
through
the
cloud
they
remember
the
sky
my
little
dreams
they
have
wings
they
are
quick
they
are
sweet
help
me
tell
my
dreams
to
the
other
children
so
that
their
bread
may
taste
whiter
so
that
the
milk
they
drink
may
make
them
think
of
meadows
in
the
sky
of
stars
help
me
give
bread
to
the
other
children
so
that
their
dreams
may
come
back
so
they
will
remember
what
they
knew
before
they
came
through
the
cloud
let
me
hold
their
little
hands
in
the
dark
the
lonely
children
about
my
dreams
the
babies
that
have
no
mothers
any
more
dear
god
let
me
hold
up
my
silver
cup
for
them
to
drink
and
tell
them
the
sweetness
of
my
dreams
six
to
seven
years
old
autumn
song
i
made
a
ring
of
leaves
on
the
autumn
grass
i
was
a
fairy
queen
all
day
inside
the
ring
the
wind
wore
sandals
not
to
make
a
noise
of
going
the
caterpillars
like
little
snow
men
had
wound
themselves
in
their
winter
coats
the
hands
of
the
trees
were
bare
and
their
fingers
fluttered
i
was
a
queen
of
yellow
leaves
and
brown
and
the
redness
of
my
fairy
ring
kept
me
warm
for
the
wind
blew
near
though
he
made
no
noise
of
going
and
i
had
a
wrap
like
the
caterpillars
even
a
queen
of
fairies
can
be
cold
when
summer
has
forgotten
and
gone
keep
me
warm
red
leaves
do
let
the
frost
tiptoe
into
my
ring
on
the
magic
grass
the
dream
when
i
slept
i
thought
i
was
upon
the
and
this
is
my
dream
i
saw
the
little
people
come
out
into
the
night
i
saw
their
wings
glittering
under
the
stars
crickets
played
all
the
tunes
they
knew
it
was
so
comfortable
with
light
stars
a
rainbow
the
moon
the
fairies
had
shiny
crowns
on
their
bright
hair
the
bottoms
of
their
little
gowns
were
roses
it
was
musical
in
the
moony
light
and
the
fairy
queen
oh
it
was
all
golden
where
she
came
with
tiny
pages
on
her
trail
she
walked
slowly
to
her
high
throne
slowly
slowly
to
music
and
watched
the
dancing
that
went
on
all
night
long
in
on
the
butterfly
butterfly
i
like
the
way
you
wear
your
wings
show
me
their
colors
for
the
light
is
going
spread
out
their
edges
of
gold
before
the
sandman
puts
me
to
sleep
and
evening
murmurs
by
evening
now
it
is
dusky
and
the
hermit
thrush
and
the
black
and
white
warbler
are
singing
and
answering
together
there
is
sweetness
in
the
tree
and
fireflies
are
counting
the
leaves
i
like
this
country
i
like
the
way
it
has
but
i
can
not
forget
my
dream
i
had
of
the
sea
the
gulls
swinging
and
calling
and
the
foamy
towers
of
the
waves
thunder
shower
the
dark
cloud
raged
gone
was
the
morning
light
the
big
drops
darted
down
the
storm
stood
tall
on
the
and
the
bees
that
were
getting
honey
out
of
wet
roses
the
hiding
bees
would
not
come
out
of
the
flowers
into
the
rain
red
cross
song
when
i
heard
the
bees
humming
in
the
hive
they
were
so
busy
about
their
honey
i
said
to
my
mother
what
can
i
give
what
can
i
give
to
help
the
red
cross
and
mother
said
to
me
you
can
give
honey
too
honey
of
smiles
honey
of
love
purple
asters
it
is
alone
the
asters
in
my
garden
it
is
the
butterflies
gleaming
like
crowns
of
kings
and
queens
it
is
alone
purple
and
blue
on
the
edge
of
purple
it
is
what
the
sun
does
and
the
air
moving
clearly
the
petals
moving
and
the
wings
in
my
queer
little
garden
song
for
a
play
soldier
drop
that
golden
spear
wait
till
the
fires
arise
wait
till
the
sky
drops
down
and
touches
the
spear
crystal
and
the
sunlight
droops
forward
like
wings
the
birds
sing
songs
of
the
sky
leans
down
where
the
spear
stands
upward
i
hear
music
it
is
the
end
peacock
feathers
on
trees
of
fairyland
grow
peacock
feathers
of
daylight
colors
like
an
austrian
fan
but
there
is
a
strange
thing
i
have
heard
that
night
gathers
these
feathers
for
her
cloak
i
have
heard
that
the
stars
the
moon
are
the
eyes
of
peacock
feathers
from
fairy
trees
it
is
a
thing
that
may
be
but
i
should
not
be
sure
of
it
my
dear
if
i
were
you
red
rooster
red
rooster
in
your
gray
coop
o
stately
creature
with
red
and
blue
yellow
and
black
you
have
a
comb
gay
as
a
parade
on
your
head
you
have
pearl
trinkets
on
your
feet
the
short
feathers
smooth
along
your
back
are
the
dark
color
of
wet
rocks
or
the
rippled
green
of
ships
when
i
look
at
their
sides
through
water
i
do
know
how
you
happened
to
be
made
so
proud
so
foolish
wearing
your
coat
of
many
colors
shouting
all
day
long
your
crooked
words
loud
sharp
not
beautiful
is
a
small
gray
person
with
a
silver
voice
is
a
shadow
that
sings
is
never
seen
unless
a
star
squeezes
through
the
leaves
or
a
moth
looks
sharply
at
a
gray
branch
how
would
it
be
i
wonder
to
sing
patiently
all
night
never
thinking
that
people
are
asleep
raindrops
and
mist
starriness
over
the
trees
the
moon
the
dew
the
other
little
singers
cricket
toad
leaf
rustling
they
would
listen
it
would
be
music
like
weather
that
gets
into
all
the
corners
of
every
night
i
see
little
shadows
i
never
saw
before
every
night
i
hear
little
voices
i
never
heard
before
when
night
comes
trailing
her
starry
cloak
i
start
out
for
slumberland
with
calling
along
the
roadside
i
say
to
one
i
say
to
another
i
hope
to
find
you
on
the
way
we
have
traveled
before
i
hope
to
hear
you
singing
on
the
road
of
dreams
seven
to
nine
years
old
the
lonesome
wave
there
is
an
island
in
the
middle
of
my
heart
and
all
day
comes
lapping
on
the
shore
a
long
silver
wave
it
is
the
lonesome
wave
i
can
not
see
the
other
side
of
it
it
will
never
go
away
until
it
meets
the
glad
gold
wave
of
happiness
wandering
over
the
monstrous
rocks
looking
into
the
caves
i
see
my
island
dark
all
cold
until
the
gold
wave
sweeps
in
from
a
sea
deep
blue
and
flings
itself
on
the
beach
oh
it
is
joy
then
no
more
whispers
like
sorrow
no
more
silvery
lonesome
lapping
of
the
long
wave
moss
have
you
seen
moss
in
the
woods
have
you
looked
under
the
trembling
caps
for
faces
have
you
seen
wonder
on
those
faces
because
you
are
so
big
rambler
rose
rambler
rose
in
great
clusters
looking
at
me
at
my
mother
with
me
under
this
your
faces
watch
us
from
outside
the
shade
the
wind
blows
on
you
the
rain
drops
on
you
the
sun
shines
on
you
you
are
brighter
than
before
you
turn
your
faces
to
the
wind
and
watch
my
mother
and
me
thinking
of
things
i
can
not
mention
outside
of
my
mind
rambler
rose
in
the
shining
wind
you
smile
at
me
smile
at
my
mother
gift
this
is
mint
and
here
are
three
pinks
i
have
brought
you
mother
they
are
wet
with
rain
and
shining
with
it
the
pinks
smell
like
more
of
them
in
a
blue
vase
the
mint
smells
like
summer
in
many
gardens
the
white
cloud
there
are
many
clouds
but
not
like
the
one
i
see
for
mine
floats
like
a
swan
in
featheriness
over
the
river
of
the
broken
pine
there
are
many
clouds
but
not
like
the
one
that
goes
sailing
like
a
ship
full
of
gold
that
shines
like
a
ship
leaning
above
blue
water
there
are
many
clouds
but
not
like
the
one
i
wait
for
for
mine
will
have
a
strangeness
whiter
than
anything
your
eyes
remember
moon
thought
the
moon
is
thinking
of
the
river
winding
through
the
mountains
far
away
because
she
has
a
river
in
her
heart
full
of
the
same
silver
the
old
bridge
the
old
bridge
has
a
wrinkled
face
he
bends
his
back
for
us
to
go
over
he
moans
and
weeps
but
we
do
not
hear
sorrow
stands
in
his
face
for
the
heavy
weight
and
worry
of
people
passing
the
trees
drop
their
leaves
into
the
water
the
sky
nods
to
him
the
leaves
float
down
like
small
ships
on
the
blue
surface
which
is
the
sky
he
is
not
always
sad
he
smiles
to
see
the
ships
go
down
and
the
little
children
playing
on
the
river
banks
ferns
small
ferns
through
the
mossy
green
and
springing
see
trees
circling
round
them
and
the
straight
brook
like
a
hear
the
water
laughing
at
the
stern
old
who
keeps
sighing
to
himself
all
day
long
what
the
use
what
the
use
land
of
nod
i
wander
mountain
to
mountain
from
sea
to
sea
i
wander
into
a
country
where
everyone
is
asleep
there
in
the
land
of
nod
i
never
think
of
home
for
home
is
there
with
sleeping
doves
and
silvery
girls
sleeping
boys
and
drowsy
roses
there
i
find
people
whose
eyes
are
heavy
and
trees
with
folded
wings
sun
flowers
stop
growing
if
you
touch
the
sky
where
those
clouds
are
passing
like
tufts
of
dandelion
gone
to
seed
the
sky
will
put
you
out
you
know
it
is
blue
like
the
sea
maybe
it
is
wet
too
your
gold
faces
will
be
gone
forever
if
you
brush
against
that
blue
ever
so
softly
holland

for

when

comes
creeping
through
the
that

with
mist
when
winds
blow
soft
windmills

and

in
holland
in
holland
everything
is
cheerful
across
the

white
nets
are
beside
the
water
where
ships
sail
by
the
mountains
begin
to
get
blue
the
dutch
girls
begin
to
sing
the
windmills
begin
to
whirl
then
night
comes
the
mountains
turn
dark
gray
and
faint
away
into
night
not
a
bird
chirps
his
song
all
is
drowsy
all
is
strange
with
the

and
stars
shining
round
the

hear
the
poplars
the
poplars
bow
forward
and
back
they
are
like
a
fan
waving
very
softly
they
tremble
for
they
love
the
wind
in
their
feathery
branches
they
love
to
look
down
at
the
shallows
at
the
mermaids
on
the
sandy
shore
they
love
to
look
into

the
tower
and
the
falcon
there
was
a
tower
once
in
a
london
street
it
was
the
highest
widest
thickest
tower
the
proudest
roundest
finest
tower
of
all
towers
english
men
passed
it
by
they
could
not
see
it
all
because
it
went
above
and
clouds
it
was
lonely
up
there
where
the
trees
stopped
until
one
day
a
blue
falcon
came
flying
he
cried
tower
do
you
know
you
are
the
highest
finest
roundest
the
tallest
proudest
greatest
of
all
the
towers
in
all
the
world
he
went
away
that
night
the
tower
made
a
new
song
about
himself
thoughts
my
thoughts
keep
going
far
away
into
another
country
under
a
different
sky
my
thoughts
are
and
sand
they
are
fluttering
in
three
parts
made
for
the
picture
on
the
jacket
of
the
norwegian
book
the
great
hunger
by
johan
bojer
i
the
rolling
in
of
the
wave
it
was
night
when
the
sky
was
dark
blue
and
the
water
came
in
with
a
wavy
look
like
a
spider
web
the
point
of
the
slope
came
down
to
the
water
edge
it
was
green
with
a
fairy
ring
of
and
fern
the
white
foam
licked
the
side
of
the
slope
as
it
came
up
and
bent
backward
it
curled
up
like
a
beautiful
bending
in
the
wind
ii
the
coming
of
the
great
bird
a
boy
was
watching
the
water
as
it
came
lapping
the
edge
of
fern
little
ships
passed
him
as
the
moon
came
leaning
across
dark
blue
rays
of
light
the
spruce
trees
saw
the
white
ships
sailing
away
and
the
moon
bending
up
the
blue
sky
where
stars
were
twinkling
like
fairy
lamps
the
boy
was
looking
toward
foreign
lands
as
the
ships
passed
their
white
sails
glittering
in
the
moonlight
he
was
thinking
how
he
wished
to
see
foreign
lands
strange
people
when
suddenly
a
bird
came
flying
it
swooped
down
upon
the
slope
and
spoke
to
him
do
you
want
to
go
across
the
deep
blue
sea
get
on
my
back
i
will
take
you
oh
cried
the
little
boy
who
sent
you
who
knew
my
thoughts
of
foreign
lands
iii
the
island
they
flew
as
the
flowed
very
softly
they
heard
sweet
singing
that
the
water
sang
they
came
to
a
place
where
the
sea
was
shallow
and
saw
treasure
hidden
there
there
was
one
poplar
tree
on
the
lonely
island
swaying
for
sadness
the
clouds
went
over
their
heads
like
a
fleet
of
drifting
ships
and
there
they
sank
down
out
of
the
air
into
the
dream
the
the
comes
over
the
mountains
wide
over
the
deserts
of
sand
with
his
bag
of
clear
drops
and
his
brush
of
feathers
he
scatters
brightness
the
white
bunnies
beg
him
for
dew
he
sprinkles
their
fur
they
shake
themselves
all
the
time
he
is
singing
the
unknown
world
is
beautiful
he
polishes
flowers
humming
oh
beautiful
he
sings
in
the
soft
light
that
grows
out
of
the
dew
out
of
the
misty
that
leans
over
him
he
makes
his
song
it
is
beautiful
the
unknown
world
yellow
yellow
sat
singing
in
a
bending
spray
of
willow
tree
thin
fine
lines
on
his
throat
the
ruffled
outside
of
his
throat
trembled
when
he
sang
he
kept
saying
the
same
thing
the
willow
did
not
mind
i
knew
what
he
said
i
knew
but
how
can
i
tell
you
i
have
to
watch
the
willow
bend
in
the
wind

me

away
but
i
was
on
his
back
so
i
went
with
him
we
had
a
castle
in
a
mountain
cloud
so
quickly

he
away
i
had
no
time
to
look
or
speak
that
was
the
last
i
saw
of

or

went
far
from
the
shining
creek
farther
than
i
know
how
to
tell
you
it
was
venice
bridge
for
a
painting
away

old
city

a
bridge
that
bridge
belonged
to
venice
it
was
to
the
rainbow
clear
it
traveled
over
an
old
canal
you
had
to
pass
a
cloudy
gate
to
reach
the
color
bridges
do
sometimes
begin
on
the
earth
and
end
in
the
sky
night

rushing
by

hurrying
over

sweeping

the

nested
their
song
is
silent
the

oo
oo

through
the

for
their
lullaby

before

and
my
are

with

out
of

before
you

sing
me
one

down

bluish
silverish
look

pine
trees
fringe
out
hemlocks
look
like
christmas
the
spruce
tree
is
feathered
and
rough
like
the
legs
of
the
red
chickens
in
our
poultry
yard
i
can
study
my
geography
from
chickens
named
for
plymouth
rock
and
rhode
island
and
from
trees
out
of
canada
no
i
shall
leave
the
chickens
out
i
shall
make
a
new
geography
of
my
own
i
shall
have
a
hillside
of
spruce
and
hemlock
like
a
separate
country
and
i
shall
mark
a
walk
of
spires
on
my
map
a
secret
road
of
balsam
trees
with
blue
buds
trees
fat
smell
like
a
wind
out
of
where
little
people
live
who
need
no
geography
but
trees
march
thought
i
am
waiting
for
the
flowers
to
come
back
i
am
alone
but
i
can
wait
for
the
birds
morning
there
is
a
brook
i
must
hear
before
i
go
to
sleep
there
is
a
birch
tree
i
must
visit
every
night
of
clearness
i
have
to
do
some
dreaming
i
have
to
listen
a
great
deal
before
light
comes
back
by
a
silver
arrow
of
cloud
and
i
rub
my
eyes
and
say
it
must
be
morning
on
this
hill
song
a
scarlet
bird
went
sailing
away
through
the
wood
it
was
only
a
mist
of
dream
that
floated
by
bare
boughs
of
my
beautiful
gray
arms
stretched
out
to
me
swaying
to
and
fro
like
angels
wings
it
was
only
a
mist
of
dream
that
floated
by
snowflake
song
snowflakes
come
in
fleets
like
ships
over
the
sea
the
moon
shines
down
on
the
crusty
snow
the
stars
make
the
sky
sparkle
like
in
a
glassy
bowl
bluebirds
are
gone
now
but
they
left
their
song
behind
them
the
moon
seems
to
say
it
is
time
for
summer
when
the
birds
come
back
to
pick
up
their
lonesome
songs
snowstorm
snowflakes
are
dancing
they
run
down
out
of
heaven
coming
home
from
somewhere
down
the
long
tired
road
they
flake
us
sometimes
the
way
they
do
the
grass
and
the
stretch
of
the
world
the
are
crowned
with
snowflakes
they
make
me
think
of
daisies
with
white
frills
around
their
necks
with
golden
faces
and
green
gowns
poor
little
daisies
and
shivering
in
the
cold
poppy
oh
big
red
poppy
you
look
stern
and
sturdy
yet
you
bow
to
the
wind
and
sing
a
lullaby
sleep
little
ones
under
my
breast
in
the
moonshine
you
make
this
lullaby
sweet
short
slow
beautiful
and
you
thank
the
dew
for
giving
you
a
drink
butterfly
as
i
walked
through
my
garden
i
saw
a
butterfly
light
on
a
flower
his
wings
were
pink
and
purple
he
spoke
a
small
word
it
was
follow
i
can
not
follow
i
told
him
i
have
to
go
the
opposite
way
clouds
the
clouds
were
gray
all
day
at
last
they
departed
and
the
blue
diamonds
shone
again
i
watched
clouds
float
past
and
flow
back
like
waves
across
the
sea
waves
that
are
foamy
and
soft
when
they
hear
clouds
calling
mother
sea
send
us
up
your
song
of
hushaby
narcissus
narcissus
i
like
to
watch
you
grow
when
snow
is
shining
beyond
the
crystal
glass
a
coat
of
snow
covers
the
hills
far
the
sun
is
setting
and
you
stretch
out
flowers
of
palest
white
in
the
pink
of
the
sun
little
snail
i
saw
a
little
snail
come
down
the
garden
walk
he
wagged
his
head
this
way
that
way
like
a
clown
in
a
circus
he
looked
from
side
to
side
as
though
he
were
from
a
different
country
i
have
always
said
he
carries
his
house
on
his
back
in
the
rain
i
saw
that
it
was
his
umbrella
cherries
are
ripe
the
cherry
tree
is
red
now
cherry
tree
nods
his
red
head
and
calls
to
the
sun
let
down
the
birds
out
of
the
sky
send
home
the
birds
to
build
nests
in
my
arms
for
i
am
ready
to
feed
them
there
is
a
little
girl
coming
for
cherries
too
i
am
that
little
girl
i
who
am
singing
she
is
coming
with
hair
flying
the
butterflies
will
be
going
says
the
cherry
for
it
is
getting
dusk
when
it
is
dawn
they
will
be
up
and
out
with
the
dew
and
sparkle
as
the
dew
does
on
the
tips
of
tall
slender
green
grasses
around
my
feet
or
on
the
cheeks
of
fruit
i
have
ripened
red
cherries
for
birds
and
children
a
thing
forgotten
white
owl
is
not
gloomy
black
bat
is
not
sad
it
is
only
that
each
has
forgotten
something
he
used
to
remember
black
bat
goes
searching
searching
white
owl
says
over
and
over
who
what
where
little
papoose
little
papoose
swung
high
in
the
branches
hears
a
song
of
birds
stars
clouds
small
nests
of
birds
small
buds
of
flowers
but
he
is
thinking
of
his
mother
with
dark
hair
like
her
horse
mane
fair
clouds
nod
to
him
where
he
swings
in
the
tree
but
he
is
thinking
of
his
father
dark
and
glistening
and
wonderful
of
his
father
with
a
voice
like
ice
and
velvet
and
tones
of
falling
water
of
his
father
who
shouts
like
a
storm
fairies
again
fairies
dancing
in
the
woods
at
night
make
me
think
of
foreign
places
of
places
unknown
fairies
with
sparkling
crowns
and
dewy
hands
sprinkle
flowers
and
mosses
to
keep
them
fresh
talk
to
the
birds
to
keep
them
cheery
once
a
bird
came
home
and
found
a
fairy
asleep
in
his
nest
upon
his
baby
eggs
to
keep
them
warm
oh
my
mother
oh
my
mother
i
looked
behind
the
mulberry
bush
and
saw
you
standing
there
you
were
all
in
white
with
a
star
on
your
forehead
oh
my
mother
i
do
not
remember
what
you
said
to
me
but
the
light
floating
above
you
was
your
love
for
your
little
girl
the
green
palm
tree
i
sat
under
a
delicate
palm
tree
on
a
shore
of
sounding
waves
i
felt
sure
i
was
alone
listening
a
flew
by
from
france
a
flew
by
from
spain
a
flew
by
from
mexico
i
laughed
softly
when
they
saw
me
it
was
those
travelers
from
foreign
countries
changed
my
thoughts
to
laughter
treasure
robbers
carry
a
treasure
into
a
field
of
wheat
with
a
great
bag
of
silk
they
go
on
careful
feet
they
dig
a
hole
deep
deep
they
bury
it
under
a
stone
cover
it
up
with
turf
leave
it
alone
what
is
there
in
the
bag
stones
that
shine
gold
can
not
rob
the
robbers
they
have
not
told
i
like
to
know
if
they
will
go
softly
to
find
the
treasure
i
like
to
know
how
much
yellow
gold
a
bag
like
that
can
hold
two
pictures
i
gorgeous
blue
mountain
i
see
a
great
mountain
stand
among
clouds
you
would
never
know
where
it
ended
oh
gorgeous
blue
mountain
of
my
heart
and
of
my
love
for
you
ii
from
a
yellow
strip
of
sand
i
watch
a
gull
go
by
he
is
to
see
the
world
of
waves
all
his
dream
is
of
the
sea
all
his
love
is
for
his
mate
tell
me
tell
me
quiet
things
when
it
is
shadowy
it
is
at
morningbreak
you
must
tell
me
tales
like
those
about
odysseus
morning
is
the
time
for
ships
and
strangers
silverhorn
it
is
out
in
the
mountains
i
find
him
my
snowy
deer
with
silver
horns
like
dew
horns
that
sparkle
i
think
i
see
him
in
the
hollow
he
is
on
the
high
hill
i
think
i
see
him
on
the
hill
he
is
leaping
through
the
air
i
think
i
can
ride
upon
his
back
he
is
like
moonlight
i
can
not
hold
he
is
like
thoughts
i
lose
he
flows
by
all
white
he
makes
me
think
of
the
brook
out
of
the
hills
with
its
little
foamy
points
like
his
twitching
ears
like
his
horns
of
silver
sparkling
the
brook
is
his
only
friend
when
he
travels
silverhorn
silverhorn
sparkling
drop
of
water
the
sun
shone
all
was
still
the
sun
made
one
sparkle
in
one
drop
before
it
fell
down
into
the
mossy
green
that
was
the
grass
it
lay
there
silent
a
long
time
the
sun
went
the
moon
came
again
one
sparkle
in
the
grass
day
then
night
sun
then
moon
year
in
year
out
so
it
went
on
with
its
life
for
several
years
until
at
last
it
was
never
heard
of
any
more
this
is
another
kind
of
sweetness
shaped
like
a
this
is
the
hive
the
bees
have
lefts
it
is
from
this
they
took
away
the
honey
for
the
other
hive
only
that
flowered
under
the
vine
i
saw
one
a
tight
unfolding
bud
half
out
he
looked
hard
down
into
my
he
was
thinking
hard
he
said
i
want
a
friend
i
was
standing
there
i
said
well
i
am
here
do
you
see
me
but
he
thought
and
thought
the
next
day
i
found
him
happy
quite
out
looking
about
the
world
the
wind
blew
sweet
airs
carried
away
his
perfume
in
the
sun
and
near
by
swung
a
new
flower
uncurling
its
hands
he
was
not
thoughtful
any
more
weather
weather
is
the
answer
when
i
ca
go
out
into
flowery
places
weather
is
my
wonder
about
the
kind
of
morning
hidden
behind
the
hills
of
sky
song
wild
birds
fly
over
me
i
am
not
the
blue
curtain
overhead
i
am
the
one
who
lives
under
the
sky
i
swing
to
the
i
pick
strawberries
i
sing
and
play
and
happiness
makes
me
like
a
great
god
on
the
earth
it
makes
me
think
of
great
things
a
little
girl
like
me
could
not
know
of
pink
pink
fluttering
down
in
hosts
i
know
what
you
mean
sometimes
in
spring
it
is
love
you
mean
love
has
a
gray
bird
that
flutters
down
a
dove
that
comes
flying
saying
the
same
thing
how
happy
it
makes
me
to
think
of
it
the
gray
dove
the
lonesome
green
apple
there
was
a
little
green
apple
that
had
lasted
over
winter
he
had
one
leaf
in
spite
of
that
he
was
lonesome
he
wondered
what
he
could
do
when
the
blossoms
were
all
around
him
but
one
day
he
saw
something
petals
were
falling
faces
were
looking
out
shapes
like
his
were
coming
in
the
buds
then
he
said
if
i
hold
on
there
will
be
a
and
i
shall
know
more
than
any
of
them
i
am
i
am
willowy
boughs
for
coolness
i
am
wings
for
darkness
i
am
a
little
grape
thinking
of
september
i
am
a
very
small
violet
thinking
of
may
mushroom
song
oh
little
mushrooms
with
brown
faces
underneath
and
bare
white
heads
you
think
of
summer
and
you
think
of
song
why
do
you
think
of
me
in
my
little
white
bed
in
the
night
you
think
only
of
your
singsong
and
your
dances
following
your
leader
round
and
round
you
think
only
of
the
grass
and
the
green
apples
and
leaves
dropping
out
of
the
blue
why
do
you
think
of
me
asleep
in
my
little
white
bed
the
wind
thinks
of
me
dancers
you
forget
but
the
wind
remembers
the
down
in
the
depths
of
the
sea
grew
the
it
was
named
by
a
queer
old
robber
and
his
mates
three
i
watched
it
for
a
second
i
watched
it
for
a
day
it
did
not
change
color
for
its
colors
stay
it
was
as
red
as
yellow
as
white
as
blue
as
gold
and
stones
with
the
light
through
i
watched
it
long
and
long
till
a
flying
sunfish
swam
through
its
branches
he
had
opal
wings
and
a
sapphire
tail
no
wonder
robbers
like
to
stay
where
fish
so
shining
come
to
play
three
loves
which
will
you
choose
and
far
white
golden
yellow
and
green
scarlet
and
azure
blue
which
will
you
choose
i
will
keep
them
in
a
box
locked
with
a
twisted
key
i
will
give
them
to
people
who
need
love
i
will
let
them
choose
blows
away
like
leaves
angels
i
know
little
about
for
myself
i
choose
because
of
the
wind
and
the
sea
and
my
heart
the
field
of
wonder
what
could
be
more
wonderful
than
the
place
where
i
walk
sometimes
swaying
like
trees
in
rain
swaying
like
trees
in
sunshine
when
breezes
stir
nothing
but
happiness
what
could
be
more
lovely
i
walk
in
the
field
of
wonder
where
colors
come
to
be
i
stare
at
the
sky
i
feel
myself
lifting
on
the
wind
as
the
swallows
lift
and
blow
upward
i
see
colors
fade
out
they
die
away
i
blow
across
a
cloud
i
am
lifted
how
can
i
change
again
into
a
little
girl
when
wings
are
in
my
feeling
of
gladness
this
is
strange
to
know
on
a
summer
day
at
noon
this
is
a
wild
new
joy
when
summer
is
over
the
scarlet
of
three
maple
trees
will
guide
me
home
oh
mother
my
dear
fear
nothing
i
will
come
home
before
snow
falls
moon
doves
the
moon
has
a
safe
and
small
hid
in
the
velvet
sky
the
doves
are
her
companions
sweet
she
has
no
others
moon
doves
on
the
wing
are
white
as
a
valley
of
stars
when
they
fly
there
is
shining
like
a
golden
river
i
see
so
many
whirling
away
and
away
how
can
they
get
home
again
the
moon
is
calm
and
never
wears
an
anxious
look
she
goes
on
smiling
i
hear
so
many
doves
along
the
sky
how
will
her
hold
them
the
moon
says
not
one
word
to
me
she
lets
me
wonder
i
went
to
sea
i
went
to
sea
in
a
boat
and
found
that
the
loveliest
shells
of
all
are
hidden
below
in
valleys
of
sand
i
saw
coral
and
sponge
and
weed
and
bubbles
like
jewels
dangling
i
saw
a
creature
with
eyes
of
mist
go
by
slowly
fingers
held
the
water
let
it
go
again
i
saw
little
fish
the
children
of
the
sea
they
were
gay
and
busy
i
wanted
the
purple
i
wanted
the
shells
i
wanted
a
little
fish
to
hold
in
my
hands
i
wanted
the
big
fish
to
stop
wandering
about
and
tell
me
all
they
knew
i
have
come
back
safe
and
dry
and
know
no
more
secrets
than
yesterday
three
thoughts
of
my
heart
as
i
was
straying
by
the
forest
brook
i
heard
my
heart
speak
to
me
listen
said
my
heart
i
have
three
thoughts
for
you
a
thought
of
clouds
a
thought
of
birds
a
thought
of
flowers
i
sat
upon
a
cushion
of
moss
listening
where
the
light
played
and
the
green
shadows
what
would
you
do
i
asked
my
heart
if
you
were
a
floating
ship
of
the
sky
if
you
were
a
peering
bird
if
you
were
a
wild
geranium
and
my
heart
made
answer
that
is
what
i
wonder
and
wonder
after
all
it
is
life
i
love
after
all
i
am
a
living
thing
after
all
i
am
the
heart
of
you
i
am
content
mountain
mountain
so
white
so
tall
the
whole
sea
must
stand
behind
you
mountain
with
the
wind
on
your
forehead
do
you
hold
the
eagles
nests
proud
thing
you
shine
like
a
lily
yet
with
a
different
whiteness
i
should
not
dare
to
venture
up
your
slippery
towers
for
i
am
thinking
you
lean
too
far
over
the
edge
of
the
world
the
brook
and
its
children
o
brook
running
down
your
mossy
way
i
hear
only
your
voice
and
the
murmuring
where
are
your
children
where
are
the
magic
stones
your
children
the
brook
answered
me
sweetly
i
left
them
on
the
alp
in
steep
fields
they
were
trying
to
hold
me
back
to
keep
me
from
this
shady
path
of
happiness
but
i
went
onward
day
by
day
until
they
got
used
to
seeing
me
pass
now
they
stand
there
in
an
enchantment
on
the
while
i
travel
fields
of
elm
and
poplar
bird
of
paradise
i
was
walking
in
a
meadow
of
paradise
when
i
heard
a
singing
far
away
and
sweet
like
a
roman
harp
sweet
and
murmurous
like
the
wind
far
and
soft
like
the
fir
trees
it
will
not
change
a
song
if
the
bird
has
a
golden
crest
no
feathers
of
blue
and
could
make
a
song
i
have
known
in
my
dreaming
a
gray
bird
that
sang
while
all
the
fields
listened
the
bird
of
paradise
is
like
flowers
of
many
trees
blooming
on
one
i
saw
him
in
the
meadow
but
it
was
the
gray
bird
i
heard
singing
beyond
and
far
shiny
brook
oh
shiny
brook
i
watch
you
on
your
way
to
the
sea
and
see
little
faces
peering
up
out
of
the
water
strange
smiles
and
questions
they
are
your
pebbles
sweet
golden
with
foam
of
the
sun
blue
with
foam
of
the
sky
i
know
their
way
of
speaking
of
talking
to
each
other
i
hear
them
telling
secrets
about
green
moss
about
fish
that
get
lost
and
how
i
am
sitting
on
a
big
stone
getting
my
feet
wet
in
shiny
brook
to
watch
their
surprising
ways
hills
the
hills
are
going
somewhere
they
have
been
on
the
way
a
long
time
they
are
like
camels
in
a
line
but
they
move
more
slowly
sometimes
at
sunset
they
carry
silks
but
most
of
the
time
silver
birch
trees
heavy
rocks
heavy
trees
gold
leaves
on
heavy
branches
till
they
are
aching
birches
like
silver
bars
they
can
hardly
lift
with
grass
so
thick
about
their
feet
to
hinder
they
have
not
gone
far
in
the
time
i
watched
them
adventure
i
went
slowly
through
the
wood
of
shadows
thinking
always
i
should
meet
some
one
there
was
no
one
i
found
a
hollow
sweet
to
rest
in
all
night
long
i
did
not
stay
i
came
out
beyond
the
trees
to
the
moaning
sea
over
the
sea
swam
a
cloud
the
outline
of
a
ship
what
if
that
ship
held
my
adventure
under
its
sails
come
quickly
to
me
come
quickly
i
am
waiting
i
am
here
on
the
sand
sail
close
i
want
to
go
over
the
waves
the
sand
holds
me
back
oh
adventure
if
you
belong
to
me
do
blow
away
down
the
sky
fairies
i
can
not
see
fairies
i
dream
them
there
is
no
fairy
can
hide
from
me
i
keep
on
dreaming
till
i
find
him
there
you
are
primrose
i
see
you
black
wing
why
do
you
stand
on
the
air
and
no
sun
shining
how
can
you
hold
yourself
so
still
on
raindrops
sliding
they
change
and
fall
they
are
not
steady
but
you
do
not
know
they
are
gone
is
there
a
silver
wire
i
can
not
see
is
the
wind
your
perch
raindrops
slide
down
your
little
shoulders
they
do
not
wet
you
i
think
you
are
not
real
in
your
green
feathers
you
are
not
a
at
all
standing
on
air
above
the
garden
i
dreamed
you
the
way
i
dream
fairies
or
the
flower
i
lost
yesterday
blue
grass
blue
grass
flowering
in
the
field
you
are
my
heart
content
it
is
not
only
through
the
day
i
see
you
but
in
dreams
at
night
when
you
trudge
up
the
hill
along
the
forest
as
i
do
you
are
small
to
shine
so
nobody
speaks
of
you
much
because
of
daisies
and
such
summer
blooms
when
you
wonder
why
i
like
you
it
makes
me
wonder
too
maybe
i
remember
when
you
grew
high
like
a
tree
above
my
head
because
i
was
a
fairy
envoy
if
i
am
happy
and
you
and
there
are
things
to
do
it
seems
to
be
the
reason
of
this
world
