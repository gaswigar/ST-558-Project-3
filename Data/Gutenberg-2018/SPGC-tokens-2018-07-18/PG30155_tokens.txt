preface
december
the
present
book
is
intended
as
far
as
possible
to
give
an
exact
insight
into
the
theory
of
relativity
to
those
readers
who
from
a
general
scientific
and
philosophical
point
of
view
are
interested
in
the
theory
but
who
are
not
conversant
with
the
mathematical
apparatus
of
theoretical
physics
the
work
presumes
a
standard
of
education
corresponding
to
that
of
a
university
matriculation
examination
and
despite
the
shortness
of
the
book
a
fair
amount
of
patience
and
force
of
will
on
the
part
of
the
reader
the
author
has
spared
himself
no
pains
in
his
endeavour
to
present
the
main
ideas
in
the
simplest
and
most
intelligible
form
and
on
the
whole
in
the
sequence
and
connection
in
which
they
actually
originated
in
the
interest
of
clearness
it
appeared
to
me
inevitable
that
i
should
repeat
myself
frequently
without
paying
the
slightest
attention
to
the
elegance
of
the
presentation
i
adhered
scrupulously
to
the
precept
of
that
brilliant
theoretical
physicist
l
boltzmann
according
to
whom
matters
of
elegance
ought
to
be
left
to
the
tailor
and
to
the
cobbler
i
make
no
pretence
of
having
withheld
from
the
reader
difficulties
which
are
inherent
to
the
subject
on
the
other
hand
i
have
purposely
treated
the
empirical
physical
foundations
of
the
theory
in
a
step
motherly
fashion
so
that
readers
unfamiliar
with
physics
may
not
feel
like
the
wanderer
who
was
unable
to
see
the
forest
for
the
trees
may
the
book
bring
some
one
a
few
happy
hours
of
suggestive
thought
december
a
einstein
part
i
the
special
theory
of
relativity
physical
meaning
of
geometrical
propositions
in
your
schooldays
most
of
you
who
read
this
book
made
acquaintance
with
the
noble
building
of
euclids
geometry
and
you
remember
perhaps
with
more
respect
than
love
the
magnificent
structure
on
the
lofty
staircase
of
which
you
were
chased
about
for
uncounted
hours
by
conscientious
teachers
by
reason
of
our
past
experience
you
would
certainly
regard
everyone
with
disdain
who
should
pronounce
even
the
most
out
of
the
way
proposition
of
this
science
to
be
untrue
but
perhaps
this
feeling
of
proud
certainty
would
leave
you
immediately
if
some
one
were
to
ask
you
what
then
do
you
mean
by
the
assertion
that
these
propositions
are
true
let
us
proceed
to
give
this
question
a
little
consideration
geometry
sets
out
form
certain
conceptions
such
as
plane
point
and
straight
line
with
which
we
are
able
to
associate
more
or
less
definite
ideas
and
from
certain
simple
propositions
axioms
which
in
virtue
of
these
ideas
we
are
inclined
to
accept
as
true
then
on
the
basis
of
a
logical
process
the
justification
of
which
we
feel
ourselves
compelled
to
admit
all
remaining
propositions
are
shown
to
follow
from
those
axioms
i
e
they
are
proven
a
proposition
is
then
correct
true
when
it
has
been
derived
in
the
recognised
manner
from
the
axioms
the
question
of
truth
of
the
individual
geometrical
propositions
is
thus
reduced
to
one
of
the
truth
of
the
axioms
now
it
has
long
been
known
that
the
last
question
is
not
only
unanswerable
by
the
methods
of
geometry
but
that
it
is
in
itself
entirely
without
meaning
we
cannot
ask
whether
it
is
true
that
only
one
straight
line
goes
through
two
points
we
can
only
say
that
euclidean
geometry
deals
with
things
called
straight
lines
to
each
of
which
is
ascribed
the
property
of
being
uniquely
determined
by
two
points
situated
on
it
the
concept
true
does
not
tally
with
the
assertions
of
pure
geometry
because
by
the
word
true
we
are
eventually
in
the
habit
of
designating
always
the
correspondence
with
a
real
object
geometry
however
is
not
concerned
with
the
relation
of
the
ideas
involved
in
it
to
objects
of
experience
but
only
with
the
logical
connection
of
these
ideas
among
themselves
it
is
not
difficult
to
understand
why
in
spite
of
this
we
feel
constrained
to
call
the
propositions
of
geometry
true
geometrical
ideas
correspond
to
more
or
less
exact
objects
in
nature
and
these
last
are
undoubtedly
the
exclusive
cause
of
the
genesis
of
those
ideas
geometry
ought
to
refrain
from
such
a
course
in
order
to
give
to
its
structure
the
largest
possible
logical
unity
the
practice
for
example
of
seeing
in
a
distance
two
marked
positions
on
a
practically
rigid
body
is
something
which
is
lodged
deeply
in
our
habit
of
thought
we
are
accustomed
further
to
regard
three
points
as
being
situated
on
a
straight
line
if
their
apparent
positions
can
be
made
to
coincide
for
observation
with
one
eye
under
suitable
choice
of
our
place
of
observation
if
in
pursuance
of
our
habit
of
thought
we
now
supplement
the
propositions
of
euclidean
geometry
by
the
single
proposition
that
two
points
on
a
practically
rigid
body
always
correspond
to
the
same
distance
line
interval
independently
of
any
changes
in
position
to
which
we
may
subject
the
body
the
propositions
of
euclidean
geometry
then
resolve
themselves
into
propositions
on
the
possible
relative
position
of
practically
rigid
bodies
geometry
which
has
been
supplemented
in
this
way
is
then
to
be
treated
as
a
branch
of
physics
we
can
now
legitimately
ask
as
to
the
truth
of
geometrical
propositions
interpreted
in
this
way
since
we
are
justified
in
asking
whether
these
propositions
are
satisfied
for
those
real
things
we
have
associated
with
the
geometrical
ideas
in
less
exact
terms
we
can
express
this
by
saying
that
by
the
truth
of
a
geometrical
proposition
in
this
sense
we
understand
its
validity
for
a
construction
with
rule
and
compasses
of
course
the
conviction
of
the
truth
of
geometrical
propositions
in
this
sense
is
founded
exclusively
on
rather
incomplete
experience
for
the
present
we
shall
assume
the
truth
of
the
geometrical
propositions
then
at
a
later
stage
in
the
general
theory
of
relativity
we
shall
see
that
this
truth
is
limited
and
we
shall
consider
the
extent
of
its
limitation
notes
it
follows
that
a
natural
object
is
associated
also
with
a
straight
line
three
points
a
b
and
c
on
a
rigid
body
thus
lie
in
a
straight
line
when
the
points
a
and
c
being
given
b
is
chosen
such
that
the
sum
of
the
distances
ab
and
bc
is
as
short
as
possible
this
incomplete
suggestion
will
suffice
for
the
present
purpose
the
system
of
co
ordinates
on
the
basis
of
the
physical
interpretation
of
distance
which
has
been
indicated
we
are
also
in
a
position
to
establish
the
distance
between
two
points
on
a
rigid
body
by
means
of
measurements
for
this
purpose
we
require
a
distance
rod
s
which
is
to
be
used
once
and
for
all
and
which
we
employ
as
a
standard
measure
if
now
a
and
b
are
two
points
on
a
rigid
body
we
can
construct
the
line
joining
them
according
to
the
rules
of
geometry
then
starting
from
a
we
can
mark
off
the
distance
s
time
after
time
until
we
reach
b
the
number
of
these
operations
required
is
the
numerical
measure
of
the
distance
ab
this
is
the
basis
of
all
measurement
of
length
every
description
of
the
scene
of
an
event
or
of
the
position
of
an
object
in
space
is
based
on
the
specification
of
the
point
on
a
rigid
body
body
of
reference
with
which
that
event
or
object
coincides
this
applies
not
only
to
scientific
description
but
also
to
everyday
life
if
i
analyse
the
place
specification
times
square
new
york
a
i
arrive
at
the
following
result
the
earth
is
the
rigid
body
to
which
the
specification
of
place
refers
times
square
new
york
is
a
well
defined
point
to
which
a
name
has
been
assigned
and
with
which
the
event
coincides
in
space
b
this
primitive
method
of
place
specification
deals
only
with
places
on
the
surface
of
rigid
bodies
and
is
dependent
on
the
existence
of
points
on
this
surface
which
are
distinguishable
from
each
other
but
we
can
free
ourselves
from
both
of
these
limitations
without
altering
the
nature
of
our
specification
of
position
if
for
instance
a
cloud
is
hovering
over
times
square
then
we
can
determine
its
position
relative
to
the
surface
of
the
earth
by
erecting
a
pole
perpendicularly
on
the
square
so
that
it
reaches
the
cloud
the
length
of
the
pole
measured
with
the
standard
measuring
rod
combined
with
the
specification
of
the
position
of
the
foot
of
the
pole
supplies
us
with
a
complete
place
specification
on
the
basis
of
this
illustration
we
are
able
to
see
the
manner
in
which
a
refinement
of
the
conception
of
position
has
been
developed
a
we
imagine
the
rigid
body
to
which
the
place
specification
is
referred
supplemented
in
such
a
manner
that
the
object
whose
position
we
require
is
reached
by
the
completed
rigid
body
b
in
locating
the
position
of
the
object
we
make
use
of
a
number
here
the
length
of
the
pole
measured
with
the
measuring
rod
instead
of
designated
points
of
reference
c
we
speak
of
the
height
of
the
cloud
even
when
the
pole
which
reaches
the
cloud
has
not
been
erected
by
means
of
optical
observations
of
the
cloud
from
different
positions
on
the
ground
and
taking
into
account
the
properties
of
the
propagation
of
light
we
determine
the
length
of
the
pole
we
should
have
required
in
order
to
reach
the
cloud
from
this
consideration
we
see
that
it
will
be
advantageous
if
in
the
description
of
position
it
should
be
possible
by
means
of
numerical
measures
to
make
ourselves
independent
of
the
existence
of
marked
positions
possessing
names
on
the
rigid
body
of
reference
in
the
physics
of
measurement
this
is
attained
by
the
application
of
the
cartesian
system
of
co
ordinates
this
consists
of
three
plane
surfaces
perpendicular
to
each
other
and
rigidly
attached
to
a
rigid
body
referred
to
a
system
of
co
ordinates
the
scene
of
any
event
will
be
determined
for
the
main
part
by
the
specification
of
the
lengths
of
the
three
perpendiculars
or
co
ordinates
x
y
z
which
can
be
dropped
from
the
scene
of
the
event
to
those
three
plane
surfaces
the
lengths
of
these
three
perpendiculars
can
be
determined
by
a
series
of
manipulations
with
rigid
measuring
rods
performed
according
to
the
rules
and
methods
laid
down
by
euclidean
geometry
in
practice
the
rigid
surfaces
which
constitute
the
system
of
co
ordinates
are
generally
not
available
furthermore
the
magnitudes
of
the
co
ordinates
are
not
actually
determined
by
constructions
with
rigid
rods
but
by
indirect
means
if
the
results
of
physics
and
astronomy
are
to
maintain
their
clearness
the
physical
meaning
of
specifications
of
position
must
always
be
sought
in
accordance
with
the
above
considerations
we
thus
obtain
the
following
result
every
description
of
events
in
space
involves
the
use
of
a
rigid
body
to
which
such
events
have
to
be
referred
the
resulting
relationship
takes
for
granted
that
the
laws
of
euclidean
geometry
hold
for
distances
the
distance
being
represented
physically
by
means
of
the
convention
of
two
marks
on
a
rigid
body
notes
here
we
have
assumed
that
there
is
nothing
left
over
i
e
that
the
measurement
gives
a
whole
number
this
difficulty
is
got
over
by
the
use
of
divided
measuring
rods
the
introduction
of
which
does
not
demand
any
fundamentally
new
method
a
einstein
used
potsdamer
platz
berlin
in
the
original
text
in
the
authorised
translation
this
was
supplemented
with
tranfalgar

we
have
changed
this
to
times
square
new
york
as
this
is
the
most
well
known
identifiable
location
to
english
speakers
in
the
present
day
note
by
the
janitor
b
it
is
not
necessary
here
to
investigate
further
the
significance
of
the
expression
coincidence
in
space
this
conception
is
sufficiently
obvious
to
ensure
that
differences
of
opinion
are
scarcely
likely
to
arise
as
to
its
applicability
in
practice
a
refinement
and
modification
of
these
views
does
not
become
necessary
until
we
come
to
deal
with
the
general
theory
of
relativity
treated
in
the
second
part
of
this
book
space
and
time
in
classical
mechanics
the
purpose
of
mechanics
is
to
describe
how
bodies
change
their
position
in
space
with
time
i
should
load
my
conscience
with
grave
sins
against
the
sacred
spirit
of
lucidity
were
i
to
formulate
the
aims
of
mechanics
in
this
way
without
serious
reflection
and
detailed
explanations
let
us
proceed
to
disclose
these
sins
it
is
not
clear
what
is
to
be
understood
here
by
position
and
space
i
stand
at
the
window
of
a
railway
carriage
which
is
travelling
uniformly
and
drop
a
stone
on
the
embankment
without
throwing
it
then
disregarding
the
influence
of
the
air
resistance
i
see
the
stone
descend
in
a
straight
line
a
pedestrian
who
observes
the
misdeed
from
the
footpath
notices
that
the
stone
falls
to
earth
in
a
parabolic
curve
i
now
ask
do
the
positions
traversed
by
the
stone
lie
in
reality
on
a
straight
line
or
on
a
parabola
moreover
what
is
meant
here
by
motion
in
space
from
the
considerations
of
the
previous
section
the
answer
is
self
evident
in
the
first
place
we
entirely
shun
the
vague
word
space
of
which
we
must
honestly
acknowledge
we
cannot
form
the
slightest
conception
and
we
replace
it
by
motion
relative
to
a
practically
rigid
body
of
reference
the
positions
relative
to
the
body
of
reference
railway
carriage
or
embankment
have
already
been
defined
in
detail
in
the
preceding
section
if
instead
of
body
of
reference
we
insert
system
of
co
ordinates
which
is
a
useful
idea
for
mathematical
description
we
are
in
a
position
to
say
the
stone
traverses
a
straight
line
relative
to
a
system
of
co
ordinates
rigidly
attached
to
the
carriage
but
relative
to
a
system
of
co
ordinates
rigidly
attached
to
the
ground
embankment
it
describes
a
parabola
with
the
aid
of
this
example
it
is
clearly
seen
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
an
independently
existing
trajectory
lit
path
curve
but
only
a
trajectory
relative
to
a
particular
body
of
reference
in
order
to
have
a
complete
description
of
the
motion
we
must
specify
how
the
body
alters
its
position
with
time
i
e
for
every
point
on
the
trajectory
it
must
be
stated
at
what
time
the
body
is
situated
there
these
data
must
be
supplemented
by
such
a
definition
of
time
that
in
virtue
of
this
definition
these
time
values
can
be
regarded
essentially
as
magnitudes
results
of
measurements
capable
of
observation
if
we
take
our
stand
on
the
ground
of
classical
mechanics
we
can
satisfy
this
requirement
for
our
illustration
in
the
following
manner
we
imagine
two
clocks
of
identical
construction
the
man
at
the
railway
carriage
window
is
holding
one
of
them
and
the
man
on
the
footpath
the
other
each
of
the
observers
determines
the
position
on
his
own
reference
body
occupied
by
the
stone
at
each
tick
of
the
clock
he
is
holding
in
his
hand
in
this
connection
we
have
not
taken
account
of
the
inaccuracy
involved
by
the
finiteness
of
the
velocity
of
propagation
of
light
with
this
and
with
a
second
difficulty
prevailing
here
we
shall
have
to
deal
in
detail
later
notes
that
is
a
curve
along
which
the
body
moves
the
galileian
system
of
co
ordinates
as
is
well
known
the
fundamental
law
of
the
mechanics
of
galilei
newton
which
is
known
as
the
law
of
inertia
can
be
stated
thus
a
body
removed
sufficiently
far
from
other
bodies
continues
in
a
state
of
rest
or
of
uniform
motion
in
a
straight
line
this
law
not
only
says
something
about
the
motion
of
the
bodies
but
it
also
indicates
the
reference
bodies
or
systems
of
coordinates
permissible
in
mechanics
which
can
be
used
in
mechanical
description
the
visible
fixed
stars
are
bodies
for
which
the
law
of
inertia
certainly
holds
to
a
high
degree
of
approximation
now
if
we
use
a
system
of
co
ordinates
which
is
rigidly
attached
to
the
earth
then
relative
to
this
system
every
fixed
star
describes
a
circle
of
immense
radius
in
the
course
of
an
astronomical
day
a
result
which
is
opposed
to
the
statement
of
the
law
of
inertia
so
that
if
we
adhere
to
this
law
we
must
refer
these
motions
only
to
systems
of
coordinates
relative
to
which
the
fixed
stars
do
not
move
in
a
circle
a
system
of
co
ordinates
of
which
the
state
of
motion
is
such
that
the
law
of
inertia
holds
relative
to
it
is
called
a
galileian
system
of
co
ordinates
the
laws
of
the
mechanics
of
galflei
newton
can
be
regarded
as
valid
only
for
a
galileian
system
of
co
ordinates
the
principle
of
relativity
in
the
restricted
sense
in
order
to
attain
the
greatest
possible
clearness
let
us
return
to
our
example
of
the
railway
carriage
supposed
to
be
travelling
uniformly
we
call
its
motion
a
uniform
translation
uniform
because
it
is
of
constant
velocity
and
direction
translation
because
although
the
carriage
changes
its
position
relative
to
the
embankment
yet
it
does
not
rotate
in
so
doing
let
us
imagine
a
raven
flying
through
the
air
in
such
a
manner
that
its
motion
as
observed
from
the
embankment
is
uniform
and
in
a
straight
line
if
we
were
to
observe
the
flying
raven
from
the
moving
railway
carriage
we
should
find
that
the
motion
of
the
raven
would
be
one
of
different
velocity
and
direction
but
that
it
would
still
be
uniform
and
in
a
straight
line
expressed
in
an
abstract
manner
we
may
say
if
a
mass
m
is
moving
uniformly
in
a
straight
line
with
respect
to
a
co
ordinate
system
k
then
it
will
also
be
moving
uniformly
and
in
a
straight
line
relative
to
a
second
co
ordinate
system
k
provided
that
the
latter
is
executing
a
uniform
translatory
motion
with
respect
to
k
in
accordance
with
the
discussion
contained
in
the
preceding
section
it
follows
that
if
k
is
a
galileian
co
ordinate
system
then
every
other
co
ordinate
system
k
is
a
galileian
one
when
in
relation
to
k
it
is
in
a
condition
of
uniform
motion
of
translation
relative
to
k
the
mechanical
laws
of
galilei
newton
hold
good
exactly
as
they
do
with
respect
to
k
we
advance
a
step
farther
in
our
generalisation
when
we
express
the
tenet
thus
if
relative
to
k
k
is
a
uniformly
moving
co
ordinate
system
devoid
of
rotation
then
natural
phenomena
run
their
course
with
respect
to
k
according
to
exactly
the
same
general
laws
as
with
respect
to
k
this
statement
is
called
the
principle
of
relativity
in
the
restricted
sense
as
long
as
one
was
convinced
that
all
natural
phenomena
were
capable
of
representation
with
the
help
of
classical
mechanics
there
was
no
need
to
doubt
the
validity
of
this
principle
of
relativity
but
in
view
of
the
more
recent
development
of
electrodynamics
and
optics
it
became
more
and
more
evident
that
classical
mechanics
affords
an
insufficient
foundation
for
the
physical
description
of
all
natural
phenomena
at
this
juncture
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
principle
of
relativity
became
ripe
for
discussion
and
it
did
not
appear
impossible
that
the
answer
to
this
question
might
be
in
the
negative
nevertheless
there
are
two
general
facts
which
at
the
outset
speak
very
much
in
favour
of
the
validity
of
the
principle
of
relativity
even
though
classical
mechanics
does
not
supply
us
with
a
sufficiently
broad
basis
for
the
theoretical
presentation
of
all
physical
phenomena
still
we
must
grant
it
a
considerable
measure
of
truth
since
it
supplies
us
with
the
actual
motions
of
the
heavenly
bodies
with
a
delicacy
of
detail
little
short
of
wonderful
the
principle
of
relativity
must
therefore
apply
with
great
accuracy
in
the
domain
of
mechanics
but
that
a
principle
of
such
broad
generality
should
hold
with
such
exactness
in
one
domain
of
phenomena
and
yet
should
be
invalid
for
another
is
a
priori
not
very
probable
we
now
proceed
to
the
second
argument
to
which
moreover
we
shall
return
later
if
the
principle
of
relativity
in
the
restricted
sense
does
not
hold
then
the
galileian
co
ordinate
systems
k
k
k
etc
which
are
moving
uniformly
relative
to
each
other
will
not
be
equivalent
for
the
description
of
natural
phenomena
in
this
case
we
should
be
constrained
to
believe
that
natural
laws
are
capable
of
being
formulated
in
a
particularly
simple
manner
and
of
course
only
on
condition
that
from
amongst
all
possible
galileian
co
ordinate
systems
we
should
have
chosen
one
k
of
a
particular
state
of
motion
as
our
body
of
reference
we
should
then
be
justified
because
of
its
merits
for
the
description
of
natural
phenomena
in
calling
this
system
absolutely
at
rest
and
all
other
galileian
systems
k
in
motion
if
for
instance
our
embankment
were
the
system
k
then
our
railway
carriage
would
be
a
system
k
relative
to
which
less
simple
laws
would
hold
than
with
respect
to
k
this
diminished
simplicity
would
be
due
to
the
fact
that
the
carriage
k
would
be
in
motion
i
e
really
with
respect
to
k
in
the
general
laws
of
nature
which
have
been
formulated
with
reference
to
k
the
magnitude
and
direction
of
the
velocity
of
the
carriage
would
necessarily
play
a
part
we
should
expect
for
instance
that
the
note
emitted
by
an
organpipe
placed
with
its
axis
parallel
to
the
direction
of
travel
would
be
different
from
that
emitted
if
the
axis
of
the
pipe
were
placed
perpendicular
to
this
direction
now
in
virtue
of
its
motion
in
an
orbit
round
the
sun
our
earth
is
comparable
with
a
railway
carriage
travelling
with
a
velocity
of
about
kilometres
per
second
if
the
principle
of
relativity
were
not
valid
we
should
therefore
expect
that
the
direction
of
motion
of
the
earth
at
any
moment
would
enter
into
the
laws
of
nature
and
also
that
physical
systems
in
their
behaviour
would
be
dependent
on
the
orientation
in
space
with
respect
to
the
earth
for
owing
to
the
alteration
in
direction
of
the
velocity
of
revolution
of
the
earth
in
the
course
of
a
year
the
earth
cannot
be
at
rest
relative
to
the
hypothetical
system
k
throughout
the
whole
year
however
the
most
careful
observations
have
never
revealed
such
anisotropic
properties
in
terrestrial
physical
space
i
e
a
physical
non
equivalence
of
different
directions
this
is
very
powerful
argument
in
favour
of
the
principle
of
relativity
the
theorem
of
the
addition
of
velocities
employed
in
classical
mechanics
let
us
suppose
our
old
friend
the
railway
carriage
to
be
travelling
along
the
rails
with
a
constant
velocity
v
and
that
a
man
traverses
the
length
of
the
carriage
in
the
direction
of
travel
with
a
velocity
w
how
quickly
or
in
other
words
with
what
velocity
w
does
the
man
advance
relative
to
the
embankment
during
the
process
the
only
possible
answer
seems
to
result
from
the
following
consideration
if
the
man
were
to
stand
still
for
a
second
he
would
advance
relative
to
the
embankment
through
a
distance
v
equal
numerically
to
the
velocity
of
the
carriage
as
a
consequence
of
his
walking
however
he
traverses
an
additional
distance
w
relative
to
the
carriage
and
hence
also
relative
to
the
embankment
in
this
second
the
distance
w
being
numerically
equal
to
the
velocity
with
which
he
is
walking
thus
in
total
be
covers
the
distance
w
v
w
relative
to
the
embankment
in
the
second
considered
we
shall
see
later
that
this
result
which
expresses
the
theorem
of
the
addition
of
velocities
employed
in
classical
mechanics
cannot
be
maintained
in
other
words
the
law
that
we
have
just
written
down
does
not
hold
in
reality
for
the
time
being
however
we
shall
assume
its
correctness
the
apparent
incompatibility
of
the
law
of
propagation
of
light
with
the
principle
of
relativity
there
is
hardly
a
simpler
law
in
physics
than
that
according
to
which
light
is
propagated
in
empty
space
every
child
at
school
knows
or
believes
he
knows
that
this
propagation
takes
place
in
straight
lines
with
a
velocity
c
km
sec
at
all
events
we
know
with
great
exactness
that
this
velocity
is
the
same
for
all
colours
because
if
this
were
not
the
case
the
minimum
of
emission
would
not
be
observed
simultaneously
for
different
colours
during
the
eclipse
of
a
fixed
star
by
its
dark
neighbour
by
means
of
similar
considerations
based
on
observa
tions
of
double
stars
the
dutch
astronomer
de
sitter
was
also
able
to
show
that
the
velocity
of
propagation
of
light
cannot
depend
on
the
velocity
of
motion
of
the
body
emitting
the
light
the
assumption
that
this
velocity
of
propagation
is
dependent
on
the
direction
in
space
is
in
itself
improbable
in
short
let
us
assume
that
the
simple
law
of
the
constancy
of
the
velocity
of
light
c
in
vacuum
is
justifiably
believed
by
the
child
at
school
who
would
imagine
that
this
simple
law
has
plunged
the
conscientiously
thoughtful
physicist
into
the
greatest
intellectual
difficulties
let
us
consider
how
these
difficulties
arise
of
course
we
must
refer
the
process
of
the
propagation
of
light
and
indeed
every
other
process
to
a
rigid
reference
body
co
ordinate
system
as
such
a
system
let
us
again
choose
our
embankment
we
shall
imagine
the
air
above
it
to
have
been
removed
if
a
ray
of
light
be
sent
along
the
embankment
we
see
from
the
above
that
the
tip
of
the
ray
will
be
transmitted
with
the
velocity
c
relative
to
the
embankment
now
let
us
suppose
that
our
railway
carriage
is
again
travelling
along
the
railway
lines
with
the
velocity
v
and
that
its
direction
is
the
same
as
that
of
the
ray
of
light
but
its
velocity
of
course
much
less
let
us
inquire
about
the
velocity
of
propagation
of
the
ray
of
light
relative
to
the
carriage
it
is
obvious
that
we
can
here
apply
the
consideration
of
the
previous
section
since
the
ray
of
light
plays
the
part
of
the
man
walking
along
relatively
to
the
carriage
the
velocity
w
of
the
man
relative
to
the
embankment
is
here
replaced
by
the
velocity
of
light
relative
to
the
embankment
w
is
the
required
velocity
of
light
with
respect
to
the
carriage
and
we
have
w
c
v
the
velocity
of
propagation
ot
a
ray
of
light
relative
to
the
carriage
thus
comes
cut
smaller
than
c
but
this
result
comes
into
conflict
with
the
principle
of
relativity
set
forth
in
section
v
for
like
every
other
general
law
of
nature
the
law
of
the
transmission
of
light
in
vacuo
in
vacuum
must
according
to
the
principle
of
relativity
be
the
same
for
the
railway
carriage
as
reference
body
as
when
the
rails
are
the
body
of
reference
but
from
our
above
consideration
this
would
appear
to
be
impossible
if
every
ray
of
light
is
propagated
relative
to
the
embankment
with
the
velocity
c
then
for
this
reason
it
would
appear
that
another
law
of
propagation
of
light
must
necessarily
hold
with
respect
to
the
carriage
a
result
contradictory
to
the
principle
of
relativity
in
view
of
this
dilemma
there
appears
to
be
nothing
else
for
it
than
to
abandon
either
the
principle
of
relativity
or
the
simple
law
of
the
propagation
of
light
in
vacuo
those
of
you
who
have
carefully
followed
the
preceding
discussion
are
almost
sure
to
expect
that
we
should
retain
the
principle
of
relativity
which
appeals
so
convincingly
to
the
intellect
because
it
is
so
natural
and
simple
the
law
of
the
propagation
of
light
in
vacuo
would
then
have
to
be
replaced
by
a
more
complicated
law
conformable
to
the
principle
of
relativity
the
development
of
theoretical
physics
shows
however
that
we
cannot
pursue
this
course
the
epoch
making
theoretical
investigations
of
h
a
lorentz
on
the
electrodynamical
and
optical
phenomena
connected
with
moving
bodies
show
that
experience
in
this
domain
leads
conclusively
to
a
theory
of
electromagnetic
phenomena
of
which
the
law
of
the
constancy
of
the
velocity
of
light
in
vacuo
is
a
necessary
consequence
prominent
theoretical
physicists
were
theref
ore
more
inclined
to
reject
the
principle
of
relativity
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
no
empirical
data
had
been
found
which
were
contradictory
to
this
principle
at
this
juncture
the
theory
of
relativity
entered
the
arena
as
a
result
of
an
analysis
of
the
physical
conceptions
of
time
and
space
it
became
evident
that
in
realily
there
is
not
the
least
incompatibilitiy
between
the
principle
of
relativity
and
the
law
of
propagation
of
light
and
that
by
systematically
holding
fast
to
both
these
laws
a
logically
rigid
theory
could
be
arrived
at
this
theory
has
been
called
the
special
theory
of
relativity
to
distinguish
it
from
the
extended
theory
with
which
we
shall
deal
later
in
the
following
pages
we
shall
present
the
fundamental
ideas
of
the
special
theory
of
relativity
on
the
idea
of
time
in
physics
lightning
has
struck
the
rails
on
our
railway
embankment
at
two
places
a
and
b
far
distant
from
each
other
i
make
the
additional
assertion
that
these
two
lightning
flashes
occurred
simultaneously
if
i
ask
you
whether
there
is
sense
in
this
statement
you
will
answer
my
question
with
a
decided
yes
but
if
i
now
approach
you
with
the
request
to
explain
to
me
the
sense
of
the
statement
more
precisely
you
find
after
some
consideration
that
the
answer
to
this
question
is
not
so
easy
as
it
appears
at
first
sight
after
some
time
perhaps
the
following
answer
would
occur
to
you
the
significance
of
the
statement
is
clear
in
itself
and
needs
no
further
explanation
of
course
it
would
require
some
consideration
if
i
were
to
be
commissioned
to
determine
by
observations
whether
in
the
actual
case
the
two
events
took
place
simultaneously
or
not
i
cannot
be
satisfied
with
this
answer
for
the
following
reason
supposing
that
as
a
result
of
ingenious
considerations
an
able
meteorologist
were
to
discover
that
the
lightning
must
always
strike
the
places
a
and
b
simultaneously
then
we
should
be
faced
with
the
task
of
testing
whether
or
not
this
theoretical
result
is
in
accordance
with
the
reality
we
encounter
the
same
difficulty
with
all
physical
statements
in
which
the
conception
simultaneous
plays
a
part
the
concept
does
not
exist
for
the
physicist
until
he
has
the
possibility
of
discovering
whether
or
not
it
is
fulfilled
in
an
actual
case
we
thus
require
a
definition
of
simultaneity
such
that
this
definition
supplies
us
with
the
method
by
means
of
which
in
the
present
case
he
can
decide
by
experiment
whether
or
not
both
the
lightning
strokes
occurred
simultaneously
as
long
as
this
requirement
is
not
satisfied
i
allow
myself
to
be
deceived
as
a
physicist
and
of
course
the
same
applies
if
i
am
not
a
physicist
when
i
imagine
that
i
am
able
to
attach
a
meaning
to
the
statement
of
simultaneity
i
would
ask
the
reader
not
to
proceed
farther
until
he
is
fully
convinced
on
this
point
after
thinking
the
matter
over
for
some
time
you
then
offer
the
following
suggestion
with
which
to
test
simultaneity
by
measuring
along
the
rails
the
connecting
line
ab
should
be
measured
up
and
an
observer
placed
at
the
mid
point
m
of
the
distance
ab
this
observer
should
be
supplied
with
an
arrangement
e
g
two
mirrors
inclined
at
which
allows
him
visually
to
observe
both
places
a
and
b
at
the
same
time
if
the
observer
perceives
the
two
flashes
of
lightning
at
the
same
time
then
they
are
simultaneous
i
am
very
pleased
with
this
suggestion
but
for
all
that
i
cannot
regard
the
matter
as
quite
settled
because
i
feel
constrained
to
raise
the
following
objection
your
definition
would
certainly
be
right
if
only
i
knew
that
the
light
by
means
of
which
the
observer
at
m
perceives
the
lightning
flashes
travels
along
the
length
a
arrow
m
with
the
same
velocity
as
along
the
length
b
arrow
m
but
an
examination
of
this
supposition
would
only
be
possible
if
we
already
had
at
our
disposal
the
means
of
measuring
time
it
would
thus
appear
as
though
we
were
moving
here
in
a
logical
circle
after
further
consideration
you
cast
a
somewhat
disdainful
glance
at
me
and
rightly
so
and
you
declare
i
maintain
my
previous
definition
nevertheless
because
in
reality
it
assumes
absolutely
nothing
about
light
there
is
only
one
demand
to
be
made
of
the
definition
of
simultaneity
namely
that
in
every
real
case
it
must
supply
us
with
an
empirical
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
the
conception
that
has
to
be
defined
is
fulfilled
that
my
definition
satisfies
this
demand
is
indisputable
that
light
requires
the
same
time
to
traverse
the
path
a
arrow
m
as
for
the
path
b
arrow
m
is
in
reality
neither
a
supposition
nor
a
hypothesis
about
the
physical
nature
of
light
but
a
stipulation
which
i
can
make
of
my
own
freewill
in
order
to
arrive
at
a
definition
of
simultaneity
it
is
clear
that
this
definition
can
be
used
to
give
an
exact
meaning
not
only
to
two
events
but
to
as
many
events
as
we
care
to
choose
and
independently
of
the
positions
of
the
scenes
of
the
events
with
respect
to
the
body
of
reference
here
the
railway
embankment
we
are
thus
led
also
to
a
definition
of
time
in
physics
for
this
purpose
we
suppose
that
clocks
of
identical
construction
are
placed
at
the
points
a
b
and
c
of
the
railway
line
co
ordinate
system
and
that
they
are
set
in
such
a
manner
that
the
positions
of
their
pointers
are
simultaneously
in
the
above
sense
the
same
under
these
conditions
we
understand
by
the
time
of
an
event
the
reading
position
of
the
hands
of
that
one
of
these
clocks
which
is
in
the
immediate
vicinity
in
space
of
the
event
in
this
manner
a
time
value
is
associated
with
every
event
which
is
essentially
capable
of
observation
this
stipulation
contains
a
further
physical
hypothesis
the
validity
of
which
will
hardly
be
doubted
without
empirical
evidence
to
the
contrary
it
has
been
assumed
that
all
these
clocks
go
at
the
same
rate
if
they
are
of
identical
construction
stated
more
exactly
when
two
clocks
arranged
at
rest
in
different
places
of
a
reference
body
are
set
in
such
a
manner
that
a
particular
position
of
the
pointers
of
the
one
clock
is
simultaneous
in
the
above
sense
with
the
same
position
of
the
pointers
of
the
other
clock
then
identical
settings
are
always
simultaneous
in
the
sense
of
the
above
definition
notes
we
suppose
further
that
when
three
events
a
b
and
c
occur
in
different
places
in
such
a
manner
that
a
is
simultaneous
with
b
and
b
is
simultaneous
with
c
simultaneous
in
the
sense
of
the
above
definition
then
the
criterion
for
the
simultaneity
of
the
pair
of
events
a
c
is
also
satisfied
this
assumption
is
a
physical
hypothesis
about
the
the
of
propagation
of
light
it
must
certainly
be
fulfilled
if
we
are
to
maintain
the
law
of
the
constancy
of
the
velocity
of
light
in
vacuo
the
relativity
of
simulatneity
up
to
now
our
considerations
have
been
referred
to
a
particular
body
of
reference
which
we
have
styled
a
railway
embankment
we
suppose
a
very
long
train
travelling
along
the
rails
with
the
constant
velocity
v
and
in
the
direction
indicated
in
fig
people
travelling
in
this
train
will
with
a
vantage
view
the
train
as
a
rigid
reference
body
co
ordinate
system
they
regard
all
events
in
fig
file
fig
gif
reference
to
the
train
then
every
event
which
takes
place
along
the
line
also
takes
place
at
a
particular
point
of
the
train
also
the
definition
of
simultaneity
can
be
given
relative
to
the
train
in
exactly
the
same
way
as
with
respect
to
the
embankment
as
a
natural
consequence
however
the
following
question
arises
are
two
events
e
g
the
two
strokes
of
lightning
a
and
b
which
are
simultaneous
with
reference
to
the
railway
embankment
also
simultaneous
relatively
to
the
train
we
shall
show
directly
that
the
answer
must
be
in
the
negative
when
we
say
that
the
lightning
strokes
a
and
b
are
simultaneous
with
respect
to
be
embankment
we
mean
the
rays
of
light
emitted
at
the
places
a
and
b
where
the
lightning
occurs
meet
each
other
at
the
mid
point
m
of
the
length
a
arrow
b
of
the
embankment
but
the
events
a
and
b
also
correspond
to
positions
a
and
b
on
the
train
let
m
be
the
mid
point
of
the
distance
a
arrow
b
on
the
travelling
train
just
when
the
flashes
as
judged
from
the
embankment
of
lightning
occur
this
point
m
naturally
coincides
with
the
point
m
but
it
moves
towards
the
right
in
the
diagram
with
the
velocity
v
of
the
train
if
an
observer
sitting
in
the
position
m
in
the
train
did
not
possess
this
velocity
then
he
would
remain
permanently
at
m
and
the
light
rays
emitted
by
the
flashes
of
lightning
a
and
b
would
reach
him
simultaneously
i
e
they
would
meet
just
where
he
is
situated
now
in
reality
considered
with
reference
to
the
railway
embankment
he
is
hastening
towards
the
beam
of
light
coming
from
b
whilst
he
is
riding
on
ahead
of
the
beam
of
light
coming
from
a
hence
the
observer
will
see
the
beam
of
light
emitted
from
b
earlier
than
he
will
see
that
emitted
from
a
observers
who
take
the
railway
train
as
their
reference
body
must
therefore
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
lightning
flash
b
took
place
earlier
than
the
lightning
flash
a
we
thus
arrive
at
the
important
result
events
which
are
simultaneous
with
reference
to
the
embankment
are
not
simultaneous
with
respect
to
the
train
and
vice
versa
relativity
of
simultaneity
every
reference
body
co
ordinate
system
has
its
own
particular
time
unless
we
are
told
the
reference
body
to
which
the
statement
of
time
refers
there
is
no
meaning
in
a
statement
of
the
time
of
an
event
now
before
the
advent
of
the
theory
of
relativity
it
had
always
tacitly
been
assumed
in
physics
that
the
statement
of
time
had
an
absolute
significance
i
e
that
it
is
independent
of
the
state
of
motion
of
the
body
of
reference
but
we
have
just
seen
that
this
assumption
is
incompatible
with
the
most
natural
definition
of
simultaneity
if
we
discard
this
assumption
then
the
conflict
between
the
law
of
the
propagation
of
light
in
vacuo
and
the
principle
of
relativity
developed
in
section
disappears
we
were
led
to
that
conflict
by
the
considerations
of
section
which
are
now
no
longer
tenable
in
that
section
we
concluded
that
the
man
in
the
carriage
who
traverses
the
distance
w
per
second
relative
to
the
carriage
traverses
the
same
distance
also
with
respect
to
the
embankment
in
each
second
of
time
but
according
to
the
foregoing
considerations
the
time
required
by
a
particular
occurrence
with
respect
to
the
carriage
must
not
be
considered
equal
to
the
duration
of
the
same
occurrence
as
judged
from
the
embankment
as
reference
body
hence
it
cannot
be
contended
that
the
man
in
walking
travels
the
distance
w
relative
to
the
railway
line
in
a
time
which
is
equal
to
one
second
as
judged
from
the
embankment
moreover
the
considerations
of
section
are
based
on
yet
a
second
assumption
which
in
the
light
of
a
strict
consideration
appears
to
be
arbitrary
although
it
was
always
tacitly
made
even
before
the
introduction
of
the
theory
of
relativity
on
the
relativity
of
the
conception
of
distance
let
us
consider
two
particular
points
on
the
train
travelling
along
the
embankment
with
the
velocity
v
and
inquire
as
to
their
distance
apart
we
already
know
that
it
is
necessary
to
have
a
body
of
reference
for
the
measurement
of
a
distance
with
respect
to
which
body
the
distance
can
be
measured
up
it
is
the
simplest
plan
to
use
the
train
itself
as
reference
body
co
ordinate
system
an
observer
in
the
train
measures
the
interval
by
marking
off
his
measuring
rod
in
a
straight
line
e
g
along
the
floor
of
the
carriage
as
many
times
as
is
necessary
to
take
him
from
the
one
marked
point
to
the
other
then
the
number
which
tells
us
how
often
the
rod
has
to
be
laid
down
is
the
required
distance
it
is
a
different
matter
when
the
distance
has
to
be
judged
from
the
railway
line
here
the
following
method
suggests
itself
if
we
call
a
and
b
the
two
points
on
the
train
whose
distance
apart
is
required
then
both
of
these
points
are
moving
with
the
velocity
v
along
the
embankment
in
the
first
place
we
require
to
determine
the
points
a
and
b
of
the
embankment
which
are
just
being
passed
by
the
two
points
a
and
b
at
a
particular
time
t
judged
from
the
embankment
these
points
a
and
b
of
the
embankment
can
be
determined
by
applying
the
definition
of
time
given
in
section
the
distance
between
these
points
a
and
b
is
then
measured
by
repeated
application
of
thee
measuring
rod
along
the
embankment
a
priori
it
is
by
no
means
certain
that
this
last
measurement
will
supply
us
with
the
same
result
as
the
first
thus
the
length
of
the
train
as
measured
from
the
embankment
may
be
different
from
that
obtained
by
measuring
in
the
train
itself
this
circumstance
leads
us
to
a
second
objection
which
must
be
raised
against
the
apparently
obvious
consideration
of
section
namely
if
the
man
in
the
carriage
covers
the
distance
w
in
a
unit
of
time
measured
from
the
train
then
this
distance
as
measured
from
the
embankment
is
not
necessarily
also
equal
to
w
notes
e
g
the
middle
of
the
first
and
of
the
hundredth
carriage
the
lorentz
transformation
the
results
of
the
last
three
sections
show
that
the
apparent
incompatibility
of
the
law
of
propagation
of
light
with
the
principle
of
relativity
section
has
been
derived
by
means
of
a
consideration
which
borrowed
two
unjustifiable
hypotheses
from
classical
mechanics
these
are
as
follows
the
time
interval
time
between
two
events
is
independent
of
the
condition
of
motion
of
the
body
of
reference
the
space
interval
distance
between
two
points
of
a
rigid
body
is
independent
of
the
condition
of
motion
of
the
body
of
reference
if
we
drop
these
hypotheses
then
the
dilemma
of
section
disappears
because
the
theorem
of
the
addition
of
velocities
derived
in
section
becomes
invalid
the
possibility
presents
itself
that
the
law
of
the
propagation
of
light
in
vacuo
may
be
compatible
with
the
principle
of
relativity
and
the
question
arises
how
have
we
to
modify
the
considerations
of
section
in
order
to
remove
the
apparent
disagreement
between
these
two
fundamental
results
of
experience
this
question
leads
to
a
general
one
in
the
discussion
of
section
we
have
to
do
with
places
and
times
relative
both
to
the
train
and
to
the
embankment
how
are
we
to
find
the
place
and
time
of
an
event
in
relation
to
the
train
when
we
know
the
place
and
time
of
the
event
with
respect
to
the
railway
embankment
is
there
a
thinkable
answer
to
this
question
of
such
a
nature
that
the
law
of
transmission
of
light
in
vacuo
does
not
contradict
the
principle
of
relativity
in
other
words
can
we
conceive
of
a
relation
between
place
and
time
of
the
individual
events
relative
to
both
reference
bodies
such
that
every
ray
of
light
possesses
the
velocity
of
transmission
c
relative
to
the
embankment
and
relative
to
the
train
this
question
leads
to
a
quite
definite
positive
answer
and
to
a
perfectly
definite
transformation
law
for
the
space
time
magnitudes
of
an
event
when
changing
over
from
one
body
of
reference
to
another
before
we
deal
with
this
we
shall
introduce
the
following
incidental
consideration
up
to
the
present
we
have
only
considered
events
taking
place
along
the
embankment
which
had
mathematically
to
assume
the
function
of
a
straight
line
in
the
manner
indicated
in
section
we
can
imagine
this
reference
body
supplemented
laterally
and
in
a
vertical
direction
by
means
of
a
framework
of
rods
so
that
an
event
which
takes
place
anywhere
can
be
localised
with
reference
to
this
framework
fig
similarly
we
can
imagine
the
train
travelling
with
the
velocity
v
to
be
continued
across
the
whole
of
space
so
that
every
event
no
matter
how
far
off
it
may
be
could
also
be
localised
with
respect
to
the
second
framework
without
committing
any
fundamental
error
we
can
disregard
the
fact
that
in
reality
these
frameworks
would
continually
interfere
with
each
other
owing
to
the
impenetrability
of
solid
bodies
in
every
such
framework
we
imagine
three
surfaces
perpendicular
to
each
other
marked
out
and
designated
as
co
ordinate
planes
co
ordinate
system
a
co
ordinate
system
k
then
corresponds
to
the
embankment
and
a
co
ordinate
system
k
to
the
train
an
event
wherever
it
may
have
taken
place
would
be
fixed
in
space
with
respect
to
k
by
the
three
perpendiculars
x
y
z
on
the
co
ordinate
planes
and
with
regard
to
time
by
a
time
value
t
relative
to
k
the
same
event
would
be
fixed
in
respect
of
space
and
time
by
corresponding
values
x
y
z
t
which
of
course
are
not
identical
with
x
y
z
t
it
has
already
been
set
forth
in
detail
how
these
magnitudes
are
to
be
regarded
as
results
of
physical
measurements
obviously
our
problem
can
be
exactly
formulated
in
the
following
manner
what
are
the
values
x
y
z
t
of
an
event
with
respect
to
k
when
the
magnitudes
x
y
z
t
of
the
same
event
with
respect
to
k
are
given
the
relations

this

known
as
the

if
in
place
of
the

we
had
taken
as
our
basis
the
tacit
assumptions
of
the
older
mechanics
as
to
the
absolute
character
of

this

is
often

the
galilei

can
be
obtained
from
the
lorentz
transformation
by
substituting
an
infinitely
large
value
for
the
velocity
of
light
c
in
the
latter
transformation
aided
by
the
following
illustration
we
can
readily
see
that
in
accordance
with
the
lorentz
transformation
the
law
of
the
transmission
of
light
in
vacuo
is
satisfied
both
for
the
reference
body
k
and
for
the
reference
body
k
a
light
signal
is
sent
along
the
positive
x
axis
and
this
light
stimulus
advances
in
accordance
with
the
equation
x
ct
i
e
with
the
velocity
c
according
to
the
equations
of
the
lorentz
transformation
this
simple
relation
between
x
and
t
involves
a
relation
between
x
and
t
in
point
of
fact
if
we
substitute
for
x
the
value
ct
in
the
first
and

of
the
lorentz

we
obtain

from

the

immediately
follows
if
referred
to

k
the

of
light
takes
place
according
to
this
equation
we
thus
see
that
the
velocity
of
transmission
relative
to
the
reference
body
k
is
also
equal
to
c
the
same
result
is
obtained
for
rays
of

advancing
in
any
other
direction
whatsoever
of
cause
this
is
not
surprising
since
the
equations
of
the
lorentz

were
derived
conformably
to
this
point

a
simple

of

the
behaviour
of
measuring
rods

clocks
in
motion
place
a
metre
rod
in
the
x
axis
of
k
in
such
a
manner
that
one
end
the
beginning
coincides
with
the
point

whilst
the
other
end
the
end
of
the
rod
coincides
with
the
point
x
i
what
is
the
length
of
the
metre
rod
relatively
to
the
system
k
in
order
to
learn
this
we
need
only
ask
where
the
beginning
of
the
rod
and
the
end
of
the
rod
lie
with
respect
to
k
at
a
particular
time
t
of
the
system
k
by
means
of
the
first
equation
of
the
lorentz
transformation
the
values
of
these
two
points
at
the
time
t
can
be
shown
to
be

the
distance
between

points

eq
but
the
metre
rod
is
moving
with
the
velocity
v
relative
to
k
it
therefore
follows
that
the
length
of
a
rigid
metre
rod
moving
in
the
direction
of
its
length
with
a
velocity
v
is
eq
of
a
metre
the
rigid
rod
is
thus
shorter
when
in
motion
than
when
at
rest
and
the
more
quickly
it
is
moving
the
shorter
is
the
rod
for
the
velocity
v
c
we
should
have
eq
a
and
for
stiii
greater
velocities
the
square
root
becomes
imaginary
from
this
we
conclude
that
in
the
theory
of
relativity
the
velocity
c
plays
the
part
of
a
limiting
velocity
which
can
neither
be
reached
nor
exceeded
by
any
real
body
of
course
this
feature
of
the
velocity
c
as
a
limiting
velocity
also
clearly
follows
from
the
equations
of
the
lorentz
transformation
for
these
became
meaningless
if
we
choose
values
of
v
greater
than
c
if
on
the
contrary
we
had
considered
a
metre
rod
at
rest
in
the
x
axis
with
respect
to
k
then
we
should
have
found
that
the
length
of
the
rod
as
judged
from
k
would
have
been
eq
this
is
quite
in
accordance
with
the
principle
of
relativity
which
forms
the
basis
of
our
considerations
a
priori
it
is
quite
clear
that
we
must
be
able
to
learn
something
about
the
physical
behaviour
of
measuring

if
we
had
based
our
considerations
on
the
galileian
transformation
we
should
not
have
obtained
a
contraction
of
the
rod
as
a
consequence

let
us
now

plays

theorem
of
the
addition
of

the
experiment
of
fizeau
now
in
practice
we
can
move
clocks
and
measuring
rods
only
with
velocities
that
are
small
compared
with
the
velocity
of
light
hence
we
shall
hardly
be
able
to
compare
the
results
of
the
previous
section
directly
with
the
reality
but
on
the
other
hand
these
results
must
strike
you
as
being
very
singular
and
for
that
reason
i
shall
now
draw
another
conclusion
from
the
theory
one
which
can
easily
be
derived
from
the
foregoing
considerations
and
which
has
been
most
elegantly
confirmed
by
experiment
in
section
we
derived
the
theorem
of
the
addition
of
velocities
in
one
direction
in
the
form
which
also
results
from
the
hypotheses
of
classical
mechanics
this
theorem
can
also
be
deduced
readily
horn
the
galilei
transformation
section
in
place
of
the
man
walking
inside
the
carriage
we
introduce
a
point
moving
relatively
to
the
co
ordinate
system
k
in
accordance
with
the
equation
x
wt
by
means
of
the
first
and
fourth
equations
of
the
galilei
transformation
we
can
express
x
and
t
in
terms
of
x
and
t
and
we
then
obtain
x
v
w
t
this
equation
expresses
nothing
else
than
the
law
of
motion
of
the
point
with
reference
to
the
system
k
of
the
man
with
reference
to
the
embankment
we
denote
this
velocity
by
the
symbol
w
and
we
then
obtain
as
in
section
w
v
w
a
but
we
can
carry
out
this
consideration
just
as
well
on
the
basis
of
the
theory
of
relativity
in
the
equation
x
wt
b
we
must
then
express
x
and
t
in
terms
of
x
and
t
making
use
of
the
first
and
fourth
equations
of
the
lorentz
transformation
instead
of
the
equation

we
then
obtain
the
equation
eq

which
corresponds
to
the
theorem
of
addition
for
velocities
in
one
direction
according
to
the
theory
of

the
question
now
arises
as
to
which
of
these
two
theorems
is
the
better
in
accord
with
experience
on
this
point
we
axe
enlightened
by
a
most
important
experiment
which
the
brilliant
physicist
fizeau
performed
more
than
half
a
century
ago
and
which
has
been
repeated
since
then
by
some
of
the
best
experimental
physicists
so
that
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
its
result
the
experiment
is
concerned
with
the
following
question
light
travels
in
a
motionless
liquid
with
a
particular
velocity
w
how
quickly
does
it
travel
in
the
direction
of
the
arrow
in
the
tube
t
see
the
accompanying
diagram
fig
when
the
liquid
above
mentioned
is
flowing
through
the
tube
with
a
velocity
v
in
accordance
with
the
principle
of
relativity
we
shall
certainly
have
to
take
for
granted
that
the
propagation
of
light
always
takes
place
with
the
same
velocity
w
with
respect
to
the
liquid
whether
the
latter
is
in
motion
with
reference
to
other
bodies
or
not
the
velocity
of
light
relative
to
the
liquid
and
the
velocity
of
the
latter
relative
to
the
tube
are
thus
known
and
we
require
the
velocity
of
light
relative
to
the
tube
it
is
clear
that
we
have
the
problem
of
section
again
before
us
the
tube
plays
the
part
of
the
railway
embankment
or
of
the
co
ordinate
system
k
the
liquid
plays
the
part
of
the

of
the

man
walking
along
the

or
of
the
moving
point
in
the
present
section
if
we
denote
the
velocity
of
the
light
relative
to
the
tube
by
w
then
this
is
given
by
the
equation
a
or
b
according
as
the
galilei
transformation
or
the
lorentz
transformation
corresponds
to
the
facts
experiment
decides
in
favour
of
equation
b
derived
from
the
theory
of
relativity
and
the
agreement
is
indeed
very
exact
according
to
recent
and
most
excellent
measurements
by
zeeman
the
influence
of
the
velocity
of
flow
v
on
the
propagation
of
light
is
represented
by
formula
b
to
within
one
per
cent
nevertheless
we
must
now
draw
attention
to
the
fact
that
a
theory
of
this
phenomenon
was
given
by
h
a
lorentz
long
before
the
statement
of
the
theory
of
relativity
this
theory
was
of
a
purely
electrodynamical
nature
and
was
obtained
by
the
use
of
particular
hypotheses
as
to
the
electromagnetic
structure
of
matter
this
circumstance
however
does
not
in
the
least
diminish
the
conclusiveness
of
the
experiment
as
a
crucial
test
in
favour
of
the
theory
of
relativity
for
the
electrodynamics
of
maxwell
lorentz
on
which
the
original
theory
was
based
in
no
way
opposes
the
theory
of
relativity
rather
has
the
latter
been
developed
trom
electrodynamics
as
an
astoundingly
simple
combination
and
generalisation
of
the
hypotheses
formerly
independent
of
each
other
on
which
electrodynamics
was
built
notes
fizeau
found
eq
where
eq
is
the
index
of
refraction
of
the
liquid
on
the
other
hand
owing
to
the
smallness
of
eq
as
compared
with
i
we
can
replace
b
in
the
first
place
by
eq
or
to
the
same
order
of
approximation
by
eq
which
agrees
with
fizeaus
result
the
heuristic
value
of
the
theory
of
relativity
our
train
of
thought
in
the
foregoing
pages
can
be
epitomised
in
the
following
manner
experience
has
led
to
the
conviction
that
on
the
one
hand
the
principle
of
relativity
holds
true
and
that
on
the
other
hand
the
velocity
of
transmission
of
light
in
vacuo
has
to
be
considered
equal
to
a
constant
c
by
uniting
these
two
postulates
we
obtained
the
law
of
transformation
for
the
rectangular
co
ordinates
x
y
z
and
the
time
t
of
the
events
which
constitute
the
processes
of
nature
in
this
connection
we
did
not
obtain
the
galilei
transformation
but
differing
from
classical
mechanics
the
lorentz
transformation
the
law
of
transmission
of
light
the
acceptance
of
which
is
justified
by
our
actual
knowledge
played
an
important
part
in
this
process
of
thought
once
in
possession
of
the
lorentz
transformation
however
we
can
combine
this
with
the
principle
of
relativity
and
sum
up
the
theory
thus
every
general
law
of
nature
must
be
so
constituted
that
it
is
transformed
into
a
law
of
exactly
the
same
form
when
instead
of
the
space
time
variables
x
y
z
t
of
the
original
coordinate
system
k
we
introduce
new
space
time
variables
x
y
z
t
of
a
co
ordinate
system
k
in
this
connection
the
relation
between
the
ordinary
and
the
accented
magnitudes
is
given
by
the
lorentz
transformation
or
in
brief
general
laws
of
nature
are
co
variant
with
respect
to
lorentz
transformations
this
is
a
definite
mathematical
condition
that
the
theory
of
relativity
demands
of
a
natural
law
and
in
virtue
of
this
the
theory
becomes
a
valuable
heuristic
aid
in
the
search
for
general
laws
of
nature
if
a
general
law
of
nature
were
to
be
found
which
did
not
satisfy
this
condition
then
at
least
one
of
the
two
fundamental
assumptions
of
the
theory
would
have
been
disproved
let
us
now
examine
what
general
results
the
latter
theory
has
hitherto
evinced
general
results
of
the
theory
it
is
clear
from
our
previous
considerations
that
the
special
theory
of
relativity
has
grown
out
of
electrodynamics
and
optics
in
these
fields
it
has
not
appreciably
altered
the
predictions
of
theory
but
it
has
considerably
simplified
the
theoretical
structure
i
e
the
derivation
of
laws
and
what
is
incomparably
more
important
it
has
considerably
reduced
the
number
of
independent
hypothese
forming
the
basis
of
theory
the
special
theory
of
relativity
has
rendered
the
maxwell
lorentz
theory
so
plausible
that
the
latter
would
have
been
generally
accepted
by
physicists
even
if
experiment
had
decided
less
unequivocally
in
its
favour
classical
mechanics
required
to
be
modified
before
it
could
come
into
line
with
the
demands
of
the
special
theory
of
relativity
for
the
main
part
however
this
modification
affects
only
the
laws
for
rapid
motions
in
which
the
velocities
of
matter
v
are
not
very
small
as
compared
with
the
velocity
of
light
we
have
experience
of
such
rapid
motions
only
in
the
case
of
electrons
and
ions
for
other
motions
the
variations
from
the
laws
of
classical
mechanics
are
too
small
to
make
themselves
evident
in
practice
we
shall
not
consider
the
motion
of
stars
until
we
come
to
speak
of
the
general
theory
of
relativity
in
accordance
with
the
theory
of
relativity
the
kinetic
energy
of
a
material
point
of
mass
m
is
no
longer
given
by
the
well
known
expression
eq
file
eq
gif
but
by
the
expression
eq
file
eq
gif
this
expression
approaches
infinity
as
the
velocity
v
approaches
the
velocity
of
light
c
the
velocity
must
therefore
always
remain
less
than
c
however
great
may
be
the
energies
used
to
produce
the
acceleration
if
we
develop
the
expression
for
the
kinetic
energy
in
the
form
of
a
series
we
obtain
eq
file
eq
gif
when
eq
is
small
compared
with
unity
the
third
of
these
terms
is
always
small
in
comparison
with
the
second
which
last
is
alone
considered
in
classical
mechanics
the
first
term
mc
does
not
contain
the
velocity
and
requires
no
consideration
if
we
are
only
dealing
with
the
question
as
to
how
the
energy
of
a
point
mass
depends
on
the
velocity
we
shall
speak
of
its
essential
significance
later
the
most
important
result
of
a
general
character
to
which
the
special
theory
of
relativity
has
led
is
concerned
with
the
conception
of
mass
before
the
advent
of
relativity
physics
recognised
two
conservation
laws
of
fundamental
importance
namely
the
law
of
the
canservation
of
energy
and
the
law
of
the
conservation
of
mass
these
two
fundamental
laws
appeared
to
be
quite
independent
of
each
other
by
means
of
the
theory
of
relativity
they
have
been
united
into
one
law
we
shall
now
briefly
consider
how
this
unification
came
about
and
what
meaning
is
to
be
attached
to
it
the
principle
of
relativity
requires
that
the
law
of
the
concervation
of
energy
should
hold
not
only
with
reference
to
a
co
ordinate
system
k
but
also
with
respect
to
every
co
ordinate
system
k
which
is
in
a
state
of
uniform
motion
of
translation
relative
to
k
or
briefly
relative
to
every
galileian
system
of
co
ordinates
in
contrast
to
classical
mechanics
the
lorentz
transformation
is
the
deciding
factor
in
the
transition
from
one
such
system
to
another
by
means
of
comparatively
simple
considerations
we
are
led
to
draw
the
following
conclusion
from
these
premises
in
conjunction
with
the
fundamental
equations
of
the
electrodynamics
of
maxwell
a
body
moving
with
the

we

the
inertial

is
not
a
constant
but
varies
according
to

the

even
be
regarded

the

identical

is
only
valid

takes
up

sends
out

we
see
that
the
term
mc
which
has
hitherto
attracted
our
attention
is
nothing
else
than
the
energy
possessed
by
the
body
before
it
absorbed
the
energy
e
a
direct
comparison
of
this
relation
with
experiment
is
not
possible
at
the
present
time
see
note

owing
to
the
fact
that
the
changes
in
energy
e
to
which
we
can
subject
a
system
are
not
large
enough
to
make
themselves
perceptible
as
a
change
in
the
inertial
mass

the

eq
gif
is
too
small
in
comparison
with
the
mass
m
which
was
present
before
the
alteration
of
the
energy
it
is
owing
to
this
circumstance
that
classical
mechanics
was
able
to
establish
successfully
the
conservation
of
mass
as
a
law
of
independent
validity
let
me
add
a
final
remark
of
a
fundamental
nature
the
success
of
the
faraday
maxwell
interpretation
of
electromagnetic
action
at
a
distance
resulted
in
physicists
becoming
convinced
that
there
are
no
such
things
as
instantaneous
actions
at
a
distance
not
involving
an
intermediary
medium
of
the
type
of
newtons
law
of
gravitation
according
to
the
theory
of
relativity
action
at
a
distance
with
the
velocity
of
light
always
takes
the
place
of
instantaneous
action
at
a
distance
or
of
action
at
a
distance
with
an
infinite
velocity
of
transmission
this
is
connected
with
the
fact
that
the
velocity
c
plays
a
fundamental
role
in
this
theory
in
part
ii
we
shall
see
in
what
way
this
result
becomes
modified
in
the
general
theory
of
relativity

e

the

up

a

this

experience
and
the
special
theory
of
relativity
to
what
extent
is
the
special
theory
of
relativity
supported
by
experience
this
question
is
not
easily
answered
for
the
reason
already
mentioned
in
connection
with
the
fundamental
experiment
of
fizeau
the
special
theory
of
relativity
has
crystallised
out
from
the
maxwell
lorentz
theory
of
electromagnetic
phenomena
thus
all
facts
of
experience
which
support
the
electromagnetic
theory
also
support
the
theory
of
relativity
as
being
of
particular
importance
i
mention
here
the
fact
that
the
theory
of
relativity
enables
us
to
predict
the
effects
produced
on
the
light
reaching
us
from
the
fixed
stars
these
results
are
obtained
in
an
exceedingly
simple
manner
and
the
effects
indicated
which
are
due
to
the
relative
motion
of
the
earth
with
reference
to
those
fixed
stars
are
found
to
be
in
accord
with
experience
we
refer
to
the
yearly
movement
of
the
apparent
position
of
the
fixed
stars
resulting
from
the
motion
of
the
earth
round
the
sun
aberration
and
to
the
influence
of
the
radial
components
of
the
relative
motions
of
the
fixed
stars
with
respect
to
the
earth
on
the
colour
of
the
light
reaching
us
from
them
the
latter
effect
manifests
itself
in
a
slight
displacement
of
the
spectral
lines
of
the
light
transmitted
to
us
from
a
fixed
star
as
compared
with
the
position
of
the
same
spectral
lines
when
they
are
produced
by
a
terrestrial
source
of
light
doppler
principle
the
experimental
arguments
in
favour
of
the
maxwell
lorentz
theory
which
are
at
the
same
time
arguments
in
favour
of
the
theory
of
relativity
are
too
numerous
to
be
set
forth
here
in
reality
they
limit
the
theoretical
possibilities
to
such
an
extent
that
no
other
theory
than
that
of
maxwell
and
lorentz
has
been
able
to
hold
its
own
when
tested
by
experience
but
there
are
two
classes
of
experimental
facts
hitherto
obtained
which
can
be
represented
in
the
maxwell
lorentz
theory
only
by
the
introduction
of
an
auxiliary
hypothesis
which
in
itself
i
e
without
making
use
of
the
theory
of
relativity
appears
extraneous
it
is
known
that
cathode
rays
and
the
so
called
b
rays
emitted
by
radioactive
substances
consist
of
negatively
electrified
particles
electrons
of
very
small
inertia
and
large
velocity
by
examining
the
deflection
of
these
rays
under
the
influence
of
electric
and
magnetic
fields
we
can
study
the
law
of
motion
of
these
particles
very
exactly
in
the
theoretical
treatment
of
these
electrons
we
are
faced
with
the
difficulty
that
electrodynamic
theory
of
itself
is
unable
to
give
an
account
of
their
nature
for
since
electrical
masses
of
one
sign
repel
each
other
the
negative
electrical
masses
constituting
the
electron
would
necessarily
be
scattered
under
the
influence
of
their
mutual
repulsions
unless
there
are
forces
of
another
kind
operating
between
them
the
nature
of
which
has
hitherto
remained
obscure
to
us
if
we
now
assume
that
the
relative
distances
between
the
electrical
masses
constituting
the
electron
remain
unchanged
during
the
motion
of
the
electron
rigid
connection
in
the
sense
of
classical
mechanics
we
arrive
at
a
law
of
motion
of
the
electron
which
does
not
agree
with
experience
guided
by
purely
formal
points
of
view
h
a
lorentz
was
the
first
to
introduce
the
hypothesis
that
the
form
of
the
electron
experiences
a
contraction
in
the
direction
of
motion
in
consequence
of
that
motion
the
contracted
length
being
proportional
to
the
expression
eq
file
eq
gif
this
hypothesis
which
is
not
justifiable
by
any
electrodynamical
facts
supplies
us
then
with
that
particular
law
of
motion
which
has
been
confirmed
with
great
precision
in
recent
years
the
theory
of
relativity
leads
to
the
same
law
of
motion
without
requiring
any
special
hypothesis
whatsoever
as
to
the
structure
and
the
behaviour
of
the
electron
we
arrived
at
a
similar
conclusion
in
section
in
connection
with
the
experiment
of
fizeau
the
result
of
which
is
foretold
by
the
theory
of
relativity
without
the
necessity
of
drawing
on
hypotheses
as
to
the
physical
nature
of
the
liquid
the
second
class
of
facts
to
which
we
have
alluded
has
reference
to
the
question
whether
or
not
the
motion
of
the
earth
in
space
can
be
made
perceptible
in
terrestrial
experiments
we
have
already
remarked
in
section
that
all
attempts
of
this
nature
led
to
a
negative
result
before
the
theory
of
relativity
was
put
forward
it
was
difficult
to
become
reconciled
to
this
negative
result
for
reasons
now
to
be
discussed
the
inherited
prejudices
about
time
and
space
did
not
allow
any
doubt
to
arise
as
to
the
prime
importance
of
the
galileian
transformation
for
changing
over
from
one
body
of
reference
to
another
now
assuming
that
the
maxwell
lorentz
equations
hold
for
a
reference
body
k
we
then
find
that
they
do
not
hold
for
a
reference
body
k
moving
uniformly
with
respect
to
k
if
we
assume
that
the
relations
of
the
galileian
transformstion
exist
between
the
co
ordinates
of
k
and
k
it
thus
appears
that
of
all
galileian
co
ordinate
systems
one
k
corresponding
to
a
particular
state
of
motion
is
physically
unique
this
result
was
interpreted
physically
by
regarding
k
as
at
rest
with
respect
to
a
hypothetical
ther
of
space
on
the
other
hand
all
coordinate
systems
k
moving
relatively
to
k
were
to
be
regarded
as
in
motion
with
respect
to
the
ther
to
this
motion
of
k
against
the
ther
ther
drift
relative
to
k
were
attributed
the
more
complicated
laws
which
were
supposed
to
hold
relative
to
k
strictly
speaking
such
an
ther
drift
ought
also
to
be
assumed
relative
to
the
earth
and
for
a
long
time
the
efforts
of
physicists
were
devoted
to
attempts
to
detect
the
existence
of
an
ther
drift
at
the
earths
surface
in
one
of
the
most
notable
of
these
attempts
michelson
devised
a
method
which
appears
as
though
it
must
be
decisive
imagine
two
mirrors
so
arranged
on
a
rigid
body
that
the
reflecting
surfaces
face
each
other
a
ray
of
light
requires
a
perfectly
definite
time
t
to
pass
from
one
mirror
to
the
other
and
back
again
if
the
whole
system
be
at
rest
with
respect
to
the
ther
it
is
found
by
calculation
however
that
a
slightly
different
time
t
is
required
for
this
process
if
the
body
together
with
the
mirrors
be
moving
relatively
to
the
ther
and
yet
another
point
it
is
shown
by
calculation
that
for
a
given
velocity
v
with
reference
to
the
ther
this
time
t
is
different
when
the
body
is
moving
perpendicularly
to
the
planes
of
the
mirrors
from
that
resulting
when
the
motion
is
parallel
to
these
planes
although
the
estimated
difference
between
these
two
times
is
exceedingly
small
michelson
and
morley
performed
an
experiment
involving
interference
in
which
this
difference
should
have
been
clearly
detectable
but
the
experiment
gave
a
negative
result
a
fact
very
perplexing
to
physicists
lorentz
and
fitzgerald
rescued
the
theory
from
this
difficulty
by
assuming
that
the
motion
of
the
body
relative
to
the
ther
produces
a
contraction
of
the
body
in
the
direction
of
motion
the
amount
of
contraction
being
just
sufficient
to
compensate
for
the
differeace
in
time
mentioned
above
comparison
with
the
discussion
in
section
shows
that
also
from
the
standpoint
of
the
theory
of
relativity
this
solution
of
the
difficulty
was
the
right
one
but
on
the
basis
of
the
theory
of
relativity
the
method
of
interpretation
is
incomparably
more
satisfactory
according
to
this
theory
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
specially
favoured
unique
co
ordinate
system
to
occasion
the
introduction
of
the
ther
idea
and
hence
there
can
be
no
ther
drift
nor
any
experiment
with
which
to
demonstrate
it
here
the
contraction
of
moving
bodies
follows
from
the
two
fundamental
principles
of
the
theory
without
the
introduction
of
particular
hypotheses
and
as
the
prime
factor
involved
in
this
contraction
we
find
not
the
motion
in
itself
to
which
we
cannot
attach
any
meaning
but
the
motion
with
respect
to
the
body
of
reference
chosen
in
the
particular
case
in
point
thus
for
a
co
ordinate
system
moving
with
the
earth
the
mirror
system
of
michelson
and
morley
is
not
shortened
but
it
is
shortened
for
a
co
ordinate
system
which
is
at
rest
relatively
to
the
sun
notes
the
general
theory
of
relativity
renders
it
likely
that
the
electrical
masses
of
an
electron
are
held
together
by
gravitational
forces
minkowskis
four
dimensional
space
the
non
mathematician
is
seized
by
a
mysterious
shuddering
when
he
hears
of
four
dimensional
things
by
a
feeling
not
unlike
that
awakened
by
thoughts
of
the
occult
and
yet
there
is
no
more
common
place
statement
than
that
the
world
in
which
we
live
is
a
four
dimensional
space
time
continuum
space
is
a
three
dimensional
continuum
by
this
we
mean
that
it
is
possible
to
describe
the
position
of
a
point
at
rest
by
means
of
three
numbers
co
ordinales
x
y
z
and
that
there
is
an
indefinite
number
of
points
in
the
neighbourhood
of
this
one
the
position
of
which
can
be
described
by
co
ordinates
such
as
x
y
z
which
may
be
as
near
as
we
choose
to
the
respective
values
of
the
co
ordinates
x
y
z
of
the
first
point
in
virtue
of
the
latter
property
we
speak
of
a
continuum
and
owing
to
the
fact
that
there
are
three
co
ordinates
we
speak
of
it
as
being
three
dimensional
similarly
the
world
of
physical
phenomena
which
was
briefly
called
world
by
minkowski
is
naturally
four
dimensional
in
the
space
time
sense
for
it
is
composed
of
individual
events
each
of
which
is
described
by
four
numbers
namely
three
space
co
ordinates
x
y
z
and
a
time
co
ordinate
the
time
value
t
the
world
is
in
this
sense
also
a
continuum
for
to
every
event
there
are
as
many
neighbouring
events
realised
or
at
least
thinkable
as
we
care
to
choose
the
co
ordinates
x
y
z
t
of
which
differ
by
an
indefinitely
small
amount
from
those
of
the
event
x
y
z
t
originally
considered
that
we
have
not
been
accustomed
to
regard
the
world
in
this
sense
as
a
four
dimensional
continuum
is
due
to
the
fact
that
in
physics
before
the
advent
of
the
theory
of
relativity
time
played
a
different
and
more
independent
role
as
compared
with
the
space
coordinates
it
is
for
this
reason
that
we
have
been
in
the
habit
of
treating
time
as
an
independent
continuum
as
a
matter
of
fact
according
to
classical
mechanics
time
is
absolute
i
e
it
is
independent
of
the
position
and
the
condition
of
motion
of
the
system
of
co
ordinates
we
see
this
expressed
in
the
last
equation
of
the
galileian
transformation
t
t
the
four
dimensional
mode
of
consideration
of
the
world
is
natural
on
the
theory
of
relativity
since
according
to
this
theory
time
is
robbed
of
its
independence
this
is
shown
by
the
fourth
equation
of
the
lorentz
transformation
eq
file
eq
gif
moreover
according
to
this
equation
the
time
difference
dt
of
two
events
with
respect
to
k
does
not
in
general
vanish
even
when
the
time
difference
dt
of
the
same
events
with
reference
to
k
vanishes
pure
space
distance
of
two
events
with
respect
to
k
results
in
time
distance
of
the
same
events
with
respect
to
k
but
the
discovery
of
minkowski
which
was
of
importance
for
the
formal
development
of
the
theory
of
relativity
does
not
lie
here
it
is
to
be
found
rather
in
the
fact
of
his
recognition
that
the
four
dimensional
space
time
continuum
of
the
theory
of
relativity
in
its
most
essential
formal
properties
shows
a
pronounced
relationship
to
the
three
dimensional
continuum
of
euclidean
geometrical
space
in
order
to
give
due
prominence
to
this
relationship
however
we
must
replace
the
usual
time
co
ordinate
t
by
an
imaginary
magnitude
eq
proportional
to
it
under
these
conditions
the
natural
laws
satisfying
the
demands
of
the
special
theory
of
relativity
assume
mathematical
forms
in
which
the
time
co
ordinate
plays
exactly
the
same
role
as
the
three
space
co
ordinates
formally
these
four
co
ordinates
correspond
exactly
to
the
three
space
co
ordinates
in
euclidean
geometry
it
must
be
clear
even
to
the
non
mathematician
that
as
a
consequence
of
this
purely
formal
addition
to
our
knowledge
the
theory
perforce
gained
clearness
in
no
mean
measure
these
inadequate
remarks
can
give
the
reader
only
a
vague
notion
of
the
important
idea
contributed
by
minkowski
without
it
the
general
theory
of
relativity

which
the
fundamental
ideas
are
developed

of
relativity
i
e
the
principle
of
the
physical
relativity
of
all
uniform
motion
let
as
once
more
analyse
its
meaning
carefully
it
was
at
all
times
clear
that
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
idea
it
conveys
to
us
every
motion
must
be
considered
only
as
a
relative
motion
returning
to
the
illustration
we
have
frequently
used
of
the
embankment
and
the
railway
carriage
we
can
express
the
fact
of
the
motion
here
taking
place
in
the
following
two
forms
both
of
which
are
equally
justifiable
a
the
carriage
is
in
motion
relative
to
the
embankment
b
the
embankment
is
in
motion
relative
to
the
carriage
in
a
the
embankment
in
b
the
carriage
serves
as
the
body
of
reference
in
our
statement
of
the
motion
taking
place
if
it
is
simply
a
question
of
detecting
or
of
describing
the
motion
involved
it
is
in
principle
immaterial
to
what
reference
body
we
refer
the
motion
as
already
mentioned
this
is
self
evident
but
it
must
not
be
confused
with
the
much
more
comprehensive
statement
called
the
principle
of
relativity
which
we
have
taken
as
the
basis
of
our
investigations
the
principle
we
have
made
use
of
not
only
maintains
that
we
may
equally
well
choose
the
carriage
or
the
embankment
as
our
reference
body
for
the
description
of
any
event
for
this
too
is
self
evident
our
principle
rather
asserts
what
follows
if
we
formulate
the
general
laws
of
nature
as
they
are
obtained
from
experience
by
making
use
of
a
the
embankment
as
reference
body
b
the
railway
carriage
as
reference
body
then
these
general
laws
of
nature
e
g
the
laws
of
mechanics
or
the
law
of
the
propagation
of
light
in
vacuo
have
exactly
the
same
form
in
both
cases
this
can
also
be
expressed
as
follows
for
the
physical
description
of
natural
processes
neither
of
the
reference
bodies
k
k
is
unique
lit
specially
marked
out
as
compared
with
the
other
unlike
the
first
this
latter
statement
need
not
of
necessity
hold
a
priori
it
is
not
contained
in
the
conceptions
of
motion
and
reference
body
and
derivable
from
them
only
experience
can
decide
as
to
its
correctness
or
incorrectness
up
to
the
present
however
we
have
by
no
means
maintained
the
equivalence
of
all
bodies
of
reference
k
in
connection
with
the
formulation
of
natural
laws
our
course
was
more
on
the
following
iines
in
the
first
place
we
started
out
from
the
assumption
that
there
exists
a
reference
body
k
whose
condition
of
motion
is
such
that
the
galileian
law
holds
with
respect
to
it
a
particle
left
to
itself
and
sufficiently
far
removed
from
all
other
particles
moves
uniformly
in
a
straight
line
with
reference
to
k
galileian
reference
body
the
laws
of
nature
were
to
be
as
simple
as
possible
but
in
addition
to
k
all
bodies
of
reference
k
should
be
given
preference
in
this
sense
and
they
should
be
exactly
equivalent
to
k
for
the
formulation
of
natural
laws
provided
that
they
are
in
a
state
of
uniform
rectilinear
and
non
rotary
motion
with
respect
to
k
all
these
bodies
of
reference
are
to
be
regarded
as
galileian
reference
bodies
the
validity
of
the
principle
of
relativity
was
assumed
only
for
these
reference
bodies
but
not
for
others
e
g
those
possessing
motion
of
a
different
kind
in
this
sense
we
speak
of
the
special
principle
of
relativity
or
special
theory
of
relativity
in
contrast
to
this
we
wish
to
understand
by
the
general
principle
of
relativity
the
following
statement
all
bodies
of
reference
k
k
etc
are
equivalent
for
the
description
of
natural
phenomena
formulation
of
the
general
laws
of
nature
whatever
may
be
their
state
of
motion
but
before
proceeding
farther
it
ought
to
be
pointed
out
that
this
formulation
must
be
replaced
later
by
a
more
abstract
one
for
reasons
which
will
become
evident
at
a
later
stage
since
the
introduction
of
the
special
principle
of
relativity
has
been
justified
every
intellect
which
strives
after
generalisation
must
feel
the
temptation
to
venture
the
step
towards
the
general
principle
of
relativity
but
a
simple
and
apparently
quite
reliable
consideration
seems
to
suggest
that
for
the
present
at
any
rate
there
is
little
hope
of
success
in
such
an
attempt
let
us
imagine
ourselves
transferred
to
our
old
friend
the
railway
carriage
which
is
travelling
at
a
uniform
rate
as
long
as
it
is
moving
unifromly
the
occupant
of
the
carriage
is
not
sensible
of
its
motion
and
it
is
for
this
reason
that
he
can
without
reluctance
interpret
the
facts
of
the
case
as
indicating
that
the
carriage
is
at
rest
but
the
embankment
in
motion
moreover
according
to
the
special
principle
of
relativity
this
interpretation
is
quite
justified
also
from
a
physical
point
of
view
if
the
motion
of
the
carriage
is
now
changed
into
a
non
uniform
motion
as
for
instance
by
a
powerful
application
of
the
brakes
then
the
occupant
of
the
carriage
experiences
a
correspondingly
powerful
jerk
forwards
the
retarded
motion
is
manifested
in
the
mechanical
behaviour
of
bodies
relative
to
the
person
in
the
railway
carriage
the
mechanical
behaviour
is
different
from
that
of
the
case
previously
considered
and
for
this
reason
it
would
appear
to
be
impossible
that
the
same
mechanical
laws
hold
relatively
to
the
non
uniformly
moving
carriage
as
hold
with
reference
to
the
carriage
when
at
rest
or
in
uniform
motion
at
all
events
it
is
clear
that
the
galileian
law
does
not
hold
with
respect
to
the
non
uniformly
moving
carriage
because
of
this
we
feel
compelled
at
the
present
juncture
to
grant
a
kind
of
absolute
physical
reality
to
non
uniform
motion
in
opposition
to
the
general
principle
of
relatvity
but
in
what
follows
we
shall
soon
see
that
this
conclusion
cannot
be
maintained
the
gravitational
field
if
we
pick
up
a
stone
and
then
let
it
go
why
does
it
fall
to
the
ground
the
usual
answer
to
this
question
is
because
it
is
attracted
by
the
earth
modern
physics
formulates
the
answer
rather
differently
for
the
following
reason
as
a
result
of
the
more
careful
study
of
electromagnetic
phenomena
we
have
come
to
regard
action
at
a
distance
as
a
process
impossible
without
the
intervention
of
some
intermediary
medium
if
for
instance
a
magnet
attracts
a
piece
of
iron
we
cannot
be
content
to
regard
this
as
meaning
that
the
magnet
acts
directly
on
the
iron
through
the
intermediate
empty
space
but
we
are
constrained
to
imagine
after
the
manner
of
faraday
that
the
magnet
always
calls
into
being
something
physically
real
in
the
space
around
it
that
something
being
what
we
call
a
magnetic
field
in
its
turn
this
magnetic
field
operates
on
the
piece
of
iron
so
that
the
latter
strives
to
move
towards
the
magnet
we
shall
not
discuss
here
the
justification
for
this
incidental
conception
which
is
indeed
a
somewhat
arbitrary
one
we
shall
only
mention
that
with
its
aid
electromagnetic
phenomena
can
be
theoretically
represented
much
more
satisfactorily
than
without
it
and
this
applies
particularly
to
the
transmission
of
electromagnetic
waves
the
effects
of
gravitation
also
are
regarded
in
an
analogous
manner
the
action
of
the
earth
on
the
stone
takes
place
indirectly
the
earth
produces
in
its
surrounding
a
gravitational
field
which
acts
on
the
stone
and
produces
its
motion
of
fall
as
we
know
from
experience
the
intensity
of
the
action
on
a
body
dimishes
according
to
a
quite
definite
law
as
we
proceed
farther
and
farther
away
from
the
earth
from
our
point
of
view
this
means
the
law
governing
the
properties
of
the
gravitational
field
in
space
must
be
a
perfectly
definite
one
in
order
correctly
to
represent
the
diminution
of
gravitational
action
with
the
distance
from
operative
bodies
it
is
something
like
this
the
body
e
g
the
earth
produces
a
field
in
its
immediate
neighbourhood
directly
the
intensity
and
direction
of
the
field
at
points
farther
removed
from
the
body
are
thence
determined
by
the
law
which
governs
the
properties
in
space
of
the
gravitational
fields
themselves
in
contrast
to
electric
and
magnetic
fields
the
gravitational
field
exhibits
a
most
remarkable
property
which
is
of
fundamental
importance
for
what
follows
bodies
which
are
moving
under
the
sole
influence
of
a
gravitational
field
receive
an
acceleration
which
does
not
in
the
least
depend
either
on
the
material
or
on
the
physical
state
of
the
body
for
instance
a
piece
of
lead
and
a
piece
of
wood
fall
in
exactly
the
same
manner
in
a
gravitational
field
in
vacuo
when
they
start
off
from
rest
or
with
the
same
initial
velocity
this
law
which
holds
most
accurately
can
be
expressed
in
a
different
form
in
the
light
of
the
following
consideration
according
to
newtons
law
of
motion
we
have
force
inertial
mass
x
acceleration
where
the
inertial
mass
is
a
characteristic
constant
of
the
accelerated
body
if
now
gravitation
is
the
cause
of
the
acceleration
we
then
have
force
gravitational
mass
x
intensity
of
the
gravitational
field
where
the
gravitational
mass
is
likewise
a
characteristic
constant
for
the
body
from
these
two
relations
follows
eq
file
eq
gif
if
now
as
we
find
from
experience
the
acceleration
is
to
be
independent
of
the
nature
and
the
condition
of
the
body
and
always
the
same
for
a
given
gravitational
field
then
the
ratio
of
the
gravitational
to
the
inertial
mass
must
likewise
be
the
same
for
all
bodies
by
a
suitable
choice
of
units
we
can
thus
make
this
ratio
equal
to
unity
we
then
have
the
following
law
the
gravitational
mass
of
a
body
is
equal
to
its
inertial
law
it
is
true
that
this
important
law
had
hitherto
been
recorded
in
mechanics
but
it
had
not
been
interpreted
a
satisfactory
interpretation
can
be
obtained
only
if
we
recognise
the
following
fact
the
same
quality
of
a
body
manifests
itself
according
to
circumstances
as
inertia
or
as
weight
lit
heaviness
in
the
following
section
we
shall
show
to
what
extent
this
is
actually
the
case
and
how
this
question
is
connected
with
the
general
postulate
of
relativity
the
equality
of
inertial
and
gravitational
mass
as
an
argument
for
the
general
postule
of
relativity
we
imagine
a
large
portion
of
empty
space
so
far
removed
from
stars
and
other
appreciable
masses
that
we
have
before
us
approximately
the
conditions
required
by
the
fundamental
law
of
galilei
it
is
then
possible
to
choose
a
galileian
reference
body
for
this
part
of
space
world
relative
to
which
points
at
rest
remain
at
rest
and
points
in
motion
continue
permanently
in
uniform
rectilinear
motion
as
reference
body
let
us
imagine
a
spacious
chest
resembling
a
room
with
an
observer
inside
who
is
equipped
with
apparatus
gravitation
naturally
does
not
exist
for
this
observer
he
must
fasten
himself
with
strings
to
the
floor
otherwise
the
slightest
impact
against
the
floor
will
cause
him
to
rise
slowly
towards
the
ceiling
of
the
room
to
the
middle
of
the
lid
of
the
chest
is
fixed
externally
a
hook
with
rope
attached
and
now
a
being
what
kind
of
a
being
is
immaterial
to
us
begins
pulling
at
this
with
a
constant
force
the
chest
together
with
the
observer
then
begin
to
move
upwards
with
a
uniformly
accelerated
motion
in
course
of
time
their
velocity
will
reach
unheard
of
values
provided
that
we
are
viewing
all
this
from
another
reference
body
which
is
not
being
pulled
with
a
rope
but
how
does
the
man
in
the
chest
regard
the
process
the
acceleration
of
the
chest
will
be
transmitted
to
him
by
the
reaction
of
the
floor
of
the
chest
he
must
therefore
take
up
this
pressure
by
means
of
his
legs
if
he
does
not
wish
to
be
laid
out
full
length
on
the
floor
he
is
then
standing
in
the
chest
in
exactly
the
same
way
as
anyone
stands
in
a
room
of
a
home
on
our
earth
if
he
releases
a
body
which
he
previously
had
in
his
land
the
accelertion
of
the
chest
will
no
longer
be
transmitted
to
this
body
and
for
this
reason
the
body
will
approach
the
floor
of
the
chest
with
an
accelerated
relative
motion
the
observer
will
further
convince
himself
that
the
acceleration
of
the
body
towards
the
floor
of
the
chest
is
always
of
the
same
magnitude
whatever
kind
of
body
he
may
happen
to
use
for
the
experiment
relying
on
his
knowledge
of
the
gravitational
field
as
it
was
discussed
in
the
preceding
section
the
man
in
the
chest
will
thus
come
to
the
conclusion
that
he
and
the
chest
are
in
a
gravitational
field
which
is
constant
with
regard
to
time
of
course
he
will
be
puzzled
for
a
moment
as
to
why
the
chest
does
not
fall
in
this
gravitational
field
just
then
however
he
discovers
the
hook
in
the
middle
of
the
lid
of
the
chest
and
the
rope
which
is
attached
to
it
and
he
consequently
comes
to
the
conclusion
that
the
chest
is
suspended
at
rest
in
the
gravitational
field
ought
we
to
smile
at
the
man
and
say
that
he
errs
in
his
conclusion
i
do
not
believe
we
ought
to
if
we
wish
to
remain
consistent
we
must
rather
admit
that
his
mode
of
grasping
the
situation
violates
neither
reason
nor
known
mechanical
laws
even
though
it
is
being
accelerated
with
respect
to
the
galileian
space
first
considered
we
can
nevertheless
regard
the
chest
as
being
at
rest
we
have
thus
good
grounds
for
extending
the
principle
of
relativity
to
include
bodies
of
reference
which
are
accelerated
with
respect
to
each
other
and
as
a
result
we
have
gained
a
powerful
argument
for
a
generalised
postulate
of
relativity
we
must
note
carefully
that
the
possibility
of
this
mode
of
interpretation
rests
on
the
fundamental
property
of
the
gravitational
field
of
giving
all
bodies
the
same
acceleration
or
what
comes
to
the
same
thing
on
the
law
of
the
equality
of
inertial
and
gravitational
mass
if
this
natural
law
did
not
exist
the
man
in
the
accelerated
chest
would
not
be
able
to
interpret
the
behaviour
of
the
bodies
around
him
on
the
supposition
of
a
gravitational
field
and
he
would
not
be
justified
on
the
grounds
of
experience
in
supposing
his
reference
body
to
be
at
rest
suppose
that
the
man
in
the
chest
fixes
a
rope
to
the
inner
side
of
the
lid
and
that
he
attaches
a
body
to
the
free
end
of
the
rope
the
result
of
this
will
be
to
strech
the
rope
so
that
it
will
hang
vertically
downwards
if
we
ask
for
an
opinion
of
the
cause
of
tension
in
the
rope
the
man
in
the
chest
will
say
the
suspended
body
experiences
a
downward
force
in
the
gravitational
field
and
this
is
neutralised
by
the
tension
of
the
rope
what
determines
the
magnitude
of
the
tension
of
the
rope
is
the
gravitational
mass
of
the
suspended
body
on
the
other
hand
an
observer
who
is
poised
freely
in
space
will
interpret
the
condition
of
things
thus
the
rope
must
perforce
take
part
in
the
accelerated
motion
of
the
chest
and
it
transmits
this
motion
to
the
body
attached
to
it
the
tension
of
the
rope
is
just
large
enough
to
effect
the
acceleration
of
the
body
that
which
determines
the
magnitude
of
the
tension
of
the
rope
is
the
inertial
mass
of
the
body
guided
by
this
example
we
see
that
our
extension
of
the
principle
of
relativity
implies
the
necessity
of
the
law
of
the
equality
of
inertial
and
gravitational
mass
thus
we
have
obtained
a
physical
interpretation
of
this
law
from
our
consideration
of
the
accelerated
chest
we
see
that
a
general
theory
of
relativity
must
yield
important
results
on
the
laws
of
gravitation
in
point
of
fact
the
systematic
pursuit
of
the
general
idea
of
relativity
has
supplied
the
laws
satisfied
by
the
gravitational
field
before
proceeding
farther
however
i
must
warn
the
reader
against
a
misconception
suggested
by
these
considerations
a
gravitational
field
exists
for
the
man
in
the
chest
despite
the
fact
that
there
was
no
such
field
for
the
co
ordinate
system
first
chosen
now
we
might
easily
suppose
that
the
existence
of
a
gravitational
field
is
always
only
an
apparent
one
we
might
also
think
that
regardless
of
the
kind
of
gravitational
field
which
may
be
present
we
could
always
choose
another
reference
body
such
that
no
gravitational
field
exists
with
reference
to
it
this
is
by
no
means
true
for
all
gravitational
fields
but
only
for
those
of
quite
special
form
it
is
for
instance
impossible
to
choose
a
body
of
reference
such
that
as
judged
from
it
the
gravitational
field
of
the
earth
in
its
entirety
vanishes
we
can
now
appreciate
why
that
argument
is
not
convincing
which
we
brought
forward
against
the
general
principle
of
relativity
at
theend
of
section
it
is
certainly
true
that
the
observer
in
the
railway
carriage
experiences
a
jerk
forwards
as
a
result
of
the
application
of
the
brake
and
that
he
recognises
in
this
the
non
uniformity
of
motion
retardation
of
the
carriage
but
he
is
compelled
by
nobody
to
refer
this
jerk
to
a
real
acceleration
retardation
of
the
carriage
he
might
also
interpret
his
experience
thus
my
body
of
reference
the
carriage
remains
permanently
at
rest
with
reference
to
it
however
there
exists
during
the
period
of
application
of
the
brakes
a
gravitational
field
which
is
directed
forwards
and
which
is
variable
with
respect
to
time
under
the
influence
of
this
field
the
embankment
together
with
the
earth
moves
non
uniformly
in
such
a
manner
that
their
original
velocity
in
the
backwards
direction
is
continuously
reduced
in
what
respects
are
the
foundations
of
classical
mechanics
and
of
the
special
theory
of
relativity
unsatisfactory
we
have
already
stated
several
times
that
classical
mechanics
starts
out
from
the
following
law
material
particles
sufficiently
far
removed
from
other
material
particles
continue
to
move
uniformly
in
a
straight
line
or
continue
in
a
state
of
rest
we
have
also
repeatedly
emphasised
that
this
fundamental
law
can
only
be
valid
for
bodies
of
reference
k
which
possess
certain
unique
states
of
motion
and
which
are
in
uniform
translational
motion
relative
to
each
other
relative
to
other
reference
bodies
k
the
law
is
not
valid
both
in
classical
mechanics
and
in
the
special
theory
of
relativity
we
therefore
differentiate
between
reference
bodies
k
relative
to
which
the
recognised
laws
of
nature
can
be
said
to
hold
and
reference
bodies
k
relative
to
which
these
laws
do
not
hold
but
no
person
whose
mode
of
thought
is
logical
can
rest
satisfied
with
this
condition
of
things
he
asks
how
does
it
come
that
certain
reference
bodies
or
their
states
of
motion
are
given
priority
over
other
reference
bodies
or
their
states
of
motion
what
is
the
reason
for
this
preference
in
order
to
show
clearly
what
i
mean
by
this
question
i
shall
make
use
of
a
comparison
i
am
standing
in
front
of
a
gas
range
standing
alongside
of
each
other
on
the
range
are
two
pans
so
much
alike
that
one
may
be
mistaken
for
the
other
both
are
half
full
of
water
i
notice
that
steam
is
being
emitted
continuously
from
the
one
pan
but
not
from
the
other
i
am
surprised
at
this
even
if
i
have
never
seen
either
a
gas
range
or
a
pan
before
but
if
i
now
notice
a
luminous
something
of
bluish
colour
under
the
first
pan
but
not
under
the
other
i
cease
to
be
astonished
even
if
i
have
never
before
seen
a
gas
flame
for
i
can
only
say
that
this
bluish
something
will
cause
the
emission
of
the
steam
or
at
least
possibly
it
may
do
so
if
however
i
notice
the
bluish
something
in
neither
case
and
if
i
observe
that
the
one
continuously
emits
steam
whilst
the
other
does
not
then
i
shall
remain
astonished
and
dissatisfied
until
i
have
discovered
some
circumstance
to
which
i
can
attribute
the
different
behaviour
of
the
two
pans
analogously
i
seek
in
vain
for
a
real
something
in
classical
mechanics
or
in
the
special
theory
of
relativity
to
which
i
can
attribute
the
different
behaviour
of
bodies
considered
with
respect
to
the
reference
systems
k
and
k
newton
saw
this
objection
and
attempted
to
invalidate
it
but
without
success
but
e
mach
recognsed
it
most
clearly
of
all
and
because
of
this
objection
he
claimed
that
mechanics
must
be
placed
on
a
new
basis
it
can
only
be
got
rid
of
by
means
of
a
physics
which
is
conformable
to
the
general
principle
of
relativity
since
the
equations
of
such
a
theory
hold
for
every
body
of
reference
whatever
may
be
its
state
of
motion
notes
the
objection
is
of
importance
more
especially
when
the
state
of
motion
of
the
reference
body
is
of
such
a
nature
that
it
does
not
require
any
external
agency
for
its
maintenance
e
g
in
the
case
when
the
reference
body
is
rotating
uniformly
a
few
inferences
from
the
general
principle
of
relativity
the
considerations
of
section
show
that
the
general
principle
of
relativity
puts
us
in
a
position
to
derive
properties
of
the
gravitational
field
in
a
purely
theoretical
manner
let
us
suppose
for
instance
that
we
know
the
space
time
course
for
any
natural
process
whatsoever
as
regards
the
manner
in
which
it
takes
place
in
the
galileian
domain
relative
to
a
galileian
body
of
reference
k
by
means
of
purely
theoretical
operations
i
e
simply
by
calculation
we
are
then
able
to
find
how
this
known
natural
process
appears
as
seen
from
a
reference
body
k
which
is
accelerated
relatively
to
k
but
since
a
gravitational
field
exists
with
respect
to
this
new
body
of
reference
k
our
consideration
also
teaches
us
how
the
gravitational
field
influences
the
process
studied
for
example
we
learn
that
a
body
which
is
in
a
state
of
uniform
rectilinear
motion
with
respect
to
k
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
galilei
is
executing
an
accelerated
and
in
general
curvilinear
motion
with
respect
to
the
accelerated
reference
body
k
chest
this
acceleration
or
curvature
corresponds
to
the
influence
on
the
moving
body
of
the
gravitational
field
prevailing
relatively
to
k
it
is
known
that
a
gravitational
field
influences
the
movement
of
bodies
in
this
way
so
that
our
consideration
supplies
us
with
nothing
essentially
new
however
we
obtain
a
new
result
of
fundamental
importance
when
we
carry
out
the
analogous
consideration
for
a
ray
of
light
with
respect
to
the
galileian
reference
body
k
such
a
ray
of
light
is
transmitted
rectilinearly
with
the
velocity
c
it
can
easily
be
shown
that
the
path
of
the
same
ray
of
light
is
no
longer
a
straight
line
when
we
consider
it
with
reference
to
the
accelerated
chest
reference
body
k
from
this
we
conclude
that
in
general
rays
of
light
are
propagated
curvilinearly
in
gravitational
fields
in
two
respects
this
result
is
of
great
importance
in
the
first
place
it
can
be
compared
with
the
reality
although
a
detailed
examination
of
the
question
shows
that
the
curvature
of
light
rays
required
by
the
general
theory
of
relativity
is
only
exceedingly
small
for
the
gravitational
fields
at
our
disposal
in
practice
its
estimated
magnitude
for
light
rays
passing
the
sun
at
grazing
incidence
is
nevertheless
seconds
of
arc
this
ought
to
manifest
itself
in
the
following
way
as
seen
from
the
earth
certain
fixed
stars
appear
to
be
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
sun
and
are
thus
capable
of
observation
during
a
total
eclipse
of
the
sun
at
such
times
these
stars
ought
to
appear
to
be
displaced
outwards
from
the
sun
by
an
amount
indicated
above
as
compared
with
their
apparent
position
in
the
sky
when
the
sun
is
situated
at
another
part
of
the
heavens
the
examination
of
the
correctness
or
otherwise
of
this
deduction
is
a
problem
of
the
greatest
importance
the
early
solution
of
which
is
to
be
expected
of
astronomers
in
the
second
place
our
result
shows
that
according
to
the
general
theory
of
relativity
the
law
of
the
constancy
of
the
velocity
of
light
in
vacuo
which
constitutes
one
of
the
two
fundamental
assumptions
in
the
special
theory
of
relativity
and
to
which
we
have
already
frequently
referred
cannot
claim
any
unlimited
validity
a
curvature
of
rays
of
light
can
only
take
place
when
the
velocity
of
propagation
of
light
varies
with
position
now
we
might
think
that
as
a
consequence
of
this
the
special
theory
of
relativity
and
with
it
the
whole
theory
of
relativity
would
be
laid
in
the
dust
but
in
reality
this
is
not
the
case
we
can
only
conclude
that
the
special
theory
of
relativity
cannot
claim
an
unlinlited
domain
of
validity
its
results
hold
only
so
long
as
we
are
able
to
disregard
the
influences
of
gravitational
fields
on
the
phenomena
e
g
of
light
since
it
has
often
been
contended
by
opponents
of
the
theory
of
relativity
that
the
special
theory
of
relativity
is
overthrown
by
the
general
theory
of
relativity
it
is
perhaps
advisable
to
make
the
facts
of
the
case
clearer
by
means
of
an
appropriate
comparison
before
the
development
of
electrodynamics
the
laws
of
electrostatics
were
looked
upon
as
the
laws
of
electricity
at
the
present
time
we
know
that
electric
fields
can
be
derived
correctly
from
electrostatic
considerations
only
for
the
case
which
is
never
strictly
realised
in
which
the
electrical
masses
are
quite
at
rest
relatively
to
each
other
and
to
the
co
ordinate
system
should
we
be
justified
in
saying
that
for
this
reason
electrostatics
is
overthrown
by
the
field
equations
of
maxwell
in
electrodynamics
not
in
the
least
electrostatics
is
contained
in
electrodynamics
as
a
limiting
case
the
laws
of
the
latter
lead
directly
to
those
of
the
former
for
the
case
in
which
the
fields
are
invariable
with
regard
to
time
no
fairer
destiny
could
be
allotted
to
any
physical
theory
than
that
it
should
of
itself
point
out
the
way
to
the
introduction
of
a
more
comprehensive
theory
in
which
it
lives
on
as
a
limiting
case
in
the
example
of
the
transmission
of
light
just
dealt
with
we
have
seen
that
the
general
theory
of
relativity
enables
us
to
derive
theoretically
the
influence
of
a
gravitational
field
on
the
course
of
natural
processes
the
iaws
of
which
are
already
known
when
a
gravitational
field
is
absent
but
the
most
attractive
problem
to
the
solution
of
which
the
general
theory
of
relativity
supplies
the
key
concerns
the
investigation
of
the
laws
satisfied
by
the
gravitational
field
itself
let
us
consider
this
for
a
moment
we
are
acquainted
with
space
time
domains
which
behave
approximately
in
a
galileian
fashion
under
suitable
choice
of
reference
body
i
e
domains
in
which
gravitational
fields
are
absent
if
we
now
refer
such
a
domain
to
a
reference
body
k
possessing
any
kind
of
motion
then
relative
to
k
there
exists
a
gravitational
field
which
is
variable
with
respect
to
space
and
time
the
character
of
this
field
will
of
course
depend
on
the
motion
chosen
for
k
according
to
the
general
theory
of
relativity
the
general
law
of
the
gravitational
field
must
be
satisfied
for
all
gravitational
fields
obtainable
in
this
way
even
though
by
no
means
all
gravitationial
fields
can
be
produced
in
this
way
yet
we
may
entertain
the
hope
that
the
general
law
of
gravitation
will
be
derivable
from
such
gravitational
fields
of
a
special
kind
this
hope
has
been
realised
in
the
most
beautiful
manner
but
between
the
clear
vision
of
this
goal
and
its
actual
realisation
it
was
necessary
to
surmount
a
serious
difficulty
and
as
this
lies
deep
at
the
root
of
things
i
dare
not
withhold
it
from
the
reader
we
require
to
extend
our
ideas
of
the
space
time
continuum
still
farther
notes
by
means
of
the
star
photographs
of
two
expeditions
equipped
by
a
joint
committee
of
the
royal
and
royal
astronomical
societies
the
existence
of
the
deflection
of
light
demanded
by
theory
was
first
confirmed
during
the
solar
eclipse
of
th
may
cf
appendix
iii
this
follows
from
a
generalisation
of
the
discussion
in
section
behaviour
of
clocks
and
measuring
rods
on
a
rotating
body
of
reference
hitherto
i
have
purposely
refrained
from
speaking
about
the
physical
interpretation
of
space
and
time
data
in
the
case
of
the
general
theory
of
relativity
as
a
consequence
i
am
guilty
of
a
certain
slovenliness
of
treatment
which
as
we
know
from
the
special
theory
of
relativity
is
far
from
being
unimportant
and
pardonable
it
is
now
high
time
that
we
remedy
this
defect
but
i
would
mention
at
the
outset
that
this
matter
lays
no
small
claims
on
the
patience
and
on
the
power
of
abstraction
of
the
reader
we
start
off
again
from
quite
special
cases
which
we
have
frequently
used
before
let
us
consider
a
space
time
domain
in
which
no
gravitational
field
exists
relative
to
a
reference
body
k
whose
state
of
motion
has
been
suitably
chosen
k
is
then
a
galileian
reference
body
as
regards
the
domain
considered
and
the
results
of
the
special
theory
of
relativity
hold
relative
to
k
let
us
supposse
the
same
domain
referred
to
a
second
body
of
reference
k
which
is
rotating
uniformly
with
respect
to
k
in
order
to
fix
our
ideas
we
shall
imagine
k
to
be
in
the
form
of
a
plane
circular
disc
which
rotates
uniformly
in
its
own
plane
about
its
centre
an
observer
who
is
sitting
eccentrically
on
the
disc
k
is
sensible
of
a
force
which
acts
outwards
in
a
radial
direction
and
which
would
be
interpreted
as
an
effect
of
inertia
centrifugal
force
by
an
observer
who
was
at
rest
with
respect
to
the
original
reference
body
k
but
the
observer
on
the
disc
may
regard
his
disc
as
a
reference
body
which
is
at
rest
on
the
basis
of
the
general
principle
of
relativity
he
is
justified
in
doing
this
the
force
acting
on
himself
and
in
fact
on
all
other
bodies
which
are
at
rest
relative
to
the
disc
he
regards
as
the
effect
of
a
gravitational
field
nevertheless
the
space
distribution
of
this
gravitational
field
is
of
a
kind
that
would
not
be
possible
on
newtons
theory
of
gravitation
but
since
the
observer
believes
in
the
general
theory
of
relativity
this
does
not
disturb
him
he
is
quite
in
the
right
when
he
believes
that
a
general
law
of
gravitation
can
be
formulated
a
law
which
not
only
explains
the
motion
of
the
stars
correctly
but
also
the
field
of
force
experienced
by
himself
the
observer
performs
experiments
on
his
circular
disc
with
clocks
and
measuring
rods
in
doing
so
it
is
his
intention
to
arrive
at
exact
definitions
for
the
signification
of
time
and
space
data
with
reference
to
the
circular
disc
k
these
definitions
being
based
on
his
observations
what
will
be
his
experience
in
this
enterprise
to
start
with
he
places
one
of
two
identically
constructed
clocks
at
the
centre
of
the
circular
disc
and
the
other
on
the
edge
of
the
disc
so
that
they
are
at
rest
relative
to
it
we
now
ask
ourselves
whether
both
clocks
go
at
the
same
rate
from
the
standpoint
of
the
non
rotating
galileian
reference
body
k
as
judged
from
this
body
the
clock
at
the
centre
of
the
disc
has
no
velocity
whereas
the
clock
at
the
edge
of
the
disc
is
in
motion
relative
to
k
in
consequence
of
the
rotation
according
to
a
result
obtained
in
section
it
follows
that
the
latter
clock
goes
at
a
rate
permanently
slower
than
that
of
the
clock
at
the
centre
of
the
circular
disc
i
e
as
observed
from
k
it
is
obvious
that
the
same
effect
would
be
noted
by
an
observer
whom
we
will
imagine
sitting
alongside
his
clock
at
the
centre
of
the
circular
disc
thus
on
our
circular
disc
or
to
make
the
case
more
general
in
every
gravitational
field
a
clock
will
go
more
quickly
or
less
quickly
according
to
the
position
in
which
the
clock
is
situated
at
rest
for
this
reason
it
is
not
possible
to
obtain
a
reasonable
definition
of
time
with
the
aid
of
clocks
which
are
arranged
at
rest
with
respect
to
the
body
of
reference
a
similar
difficulty
presents
itself
when
we
attempt
to
apply
our
earlier
definition
of
simultaneity
in
such
a
case
but
i
do
not
wish
to
go
any
farther
into
this
question
moreover
at
this
stage
the
definition
of
the
space
co
ordinates
also
presents
insurmountable
difficulties
if
the
observer
applies
his
standard
measuring
rod
a
rod
which
is
short
as
compared
with
the
radius
of
the
disc
tangentially
to
the
edge
of
the
disc
then
as
judged
from
the
galileian
system
the
length
of
this
rod
will
be
less
than
i
since
according
to
section
moving
bodies
suffer
a
shortening
in
the
direction
of
the
motion
on
the
other
hand
the
measaring
rod
will
not
experience
a
shortening
in
length
as
judged
from
k
if
it
is
applied
to
the
disc
in
the
direction
of
the
radius
if
then
the
observer
first
measures
the
circumference
of
the
disc
with
his
measuring
rod
and
then
the
diameter
of
the
disc
on
dividing
the
one
by
the
other
he
will
not
obtain
as
quotient
the
familiar
number
p
but
a
larger
number
whereas
of
course
for
a
disc
which
is
at
rest
with
respect
to
k
this
operation
would
yield
p
exactly
this
proves
that
the
propositions
of
euclidean
geometry
cannot
hold
exactly
on
the
rotating
disc
nor
in
general
in
a
gravitational
field
at
least
if
we
attribute
the
length
i
to
the
rod
in
all
positions
and
in
every
orientation
hence
the
idea
of
a
straight
line
also
loses
its
meaning
we
are
therefore
not
in
a
position
to
define
exactly
the
co
ordinates
x
y
z
relative
to
the
disc
by
means
of
the
method
used
in
discussing
the
special
theory
and
as
long
as
the
co
ordinates
and
times
of
events
have
not
been
defined
we
cannot
assign
an
exact
meaning
to
the
natural
laws
in
which
these
occur
thus
all
our
previous
conclusions
based
on
general
relativity
would
appear
to
be
called
in
question
in
reality
we
must
make
a
subtle
detour
in
order
to
be
able
to
apply
the
postulate
of
general
relativity
exactly
i
shall
prepare
the
reader
for
this
in
the
following
paragraphs
notes
the
field
disappears
at
the
centre
of
the
disc
and
increases
proportionally
to
the
distance
from
the
centre
as
we
proceed
outwards
throughout
this
consideration
we
have
to
use
the
galileian
non
rotating
system
k
as
reference
body
since
we
may
only
assume
the
validity
of
the
results
of
the
special
theory
of
relativity
relative
to
k
relative
to
k
a
gravitational
field
prevails
euclidean
and
non
euclidean
continuum
the
surface
of
a
marble
table
is
spread
out
in
front
of
me
i
can
get
from
any
one
point
on
this
table
to
any
other
point
by
passing
continuously
from
one
point
to
a
neighbouring
one
and
repeating
this
process
a
large
number
of
times
or
in
other
words
by
going
from
point
to
point
without
executing
jumps
i
am
sure
the
reader
will
appreciate
with
sufficient
clearness
what
i
mean
here
by
neighbouring
and
by
jumps
if
he
is
not
too
pedantic
we
express
this
property
of
the
surface
by
describing
the
latter
as
a
continuum
let
us
now
imagine
that
a
large
number
of
little
rods
of
equal
length
have
been
made
their
lengths
being
small
compared
with
the
dimensions
of
the
marble
slab
when
i
say
they
are
of
equal
length
i
mean
that
one
can
be
laid
on
any
other
without
the
ends
overlapping
we
next
lay
four
of
these
little
rods
on
the
marble
slab
so
that
they
constitute
a
quadrilateral
figure
a
square
the
diagonals
of
which
are
equally
long
to
ensure
the
equality
of
the
diagonals
we
make
use
of
a
little
testing
rod
to
this
square
we
add
similar
ones
each
of
which
has
one
rod
in
common
with
the
first
we
proceed
in
like
manner
with
each
of
these
squares
until
finally
the
whole
marble
slab
is
laid
out
with
squares
the
arrangement
is
such
that
each
side
of
a
square
belongs
to
two
squares
and
each
corner
to
four
squares
it
is
a
veritable
wonder
that
we
can
carry
out
this
business
without
getting
into
the
greatest
difficulties
we
only
need
to
think
of
the
following
if
at
any
moment
three
squares
meet
at
a
corner
then
two
sides
of
the
fourth
square
are
already
laid
and
as
a
consequence
the
arrangement
of
the
remaining
two
sides
of
the
square
is
already
completely
determined
but
i
am
now
no
longer
able
to
adjust
the
quadrilateral
so
that
its
diagonals
may
be
equal
if
they
are
equal
of
their
own
accord
then
this
is
an
especial
favour
of
the
marble
slab
and
of
the
little
rods
about
which
i
can
only
be
thankfully
surprised
we
must
experience
many
such
surprises
if
the
construction
is
to
be
successful
if
everything
has
really
gone
smoothly
then
i
say
that
the
points
of
the
marble
slab
constitute
a
euclidean
continuum
with
respect
to
the
little
rod
which
has
been
used
as
a
distance
line
interval
by
choosing
one
corner
of
a
square
as
origin
i
can
characterise
every
other
corner
of
a
square
with
reference
to
this
origin
by
means
of
two
numbers
i
only
need
state
how
many
rods
i
must
pass
over
when
starting
from
the
origin
i
proceed
towards
the
right
and
then
upwards
in
order
to
arrive
at
the
corner
of
the
square
under
consideration
these
two
numbers
are
then
the
cartesian
co
ordinates
of
this
corner
with
reference
to
the
cartesian
co
ordinate
system
which
is
determined
by
the
arrangement
of
little
rods
by
making
use
of
the
following
modification
of
this
abstract
experiment
we
recognise
that
there
must
also
be
cases
in
which
the
experiment
would
be
unsuccessful
we
shall
suppose
that
the
rods
expand
by
in
amount
proportional
to
the
increase
of
temperature
we
heat
the
central
part
of
the
marble
slab
but
not
the
periphery
in
which
case
two
of
our
little
rods
can
still
be
brought
into
coincidence
at
every
position
on
the
table
but
our
construction
of
squares
must
necessarily
come
into
disorder
during
the
heating
because
the
little
rods
on
the
central
region
of
the
table
expand
whereas
those
on
the
outer
part
do
not
with
reference
to
our
little
rods
defined
as
unit
lengths
the
marble
slab
is
no
longer
a
euclidean
continuum
and
we
are
also
no
longer
in
the
position
of
defining
cartesian
co
ordinates
directly
with
their
aid
since
the
above
construction
can
no
longer
be
carried
out
but
since
there
are
other
things
which
are
not
influenced
in
a
similar
manner
to
the
little
rods
or
perhaps
not
at
all
by
the
temperature
of
the
table
it
is
possible
quite
naturally
to
maintain
the
point
of
view
that
the
marble
slab
is
a
euclidean
continuum
this
can
be
done
in
a
satisfactory
manner
by
making
a
more
subtle
stipulation
about
the
measurement
or
the
comparison
of
lengths
but
if
rods
of
every
kind
i
e
of
every
material
were
to
behave
in
the
same
way
as
regards
the
influence
of
temperature
when
they
are
on
the
variably
heated
marble
slab
and
if
we
had
no
other
means
of
detecting
the
effect
of
temperature
than
the
geometrical
behaviour
of
our
rods
in
experiments
analogous
to
the
one
described
above
then
our
best
plan
would
be
to
assign
the
distance
one
to
two
points
on
the
slab
provided
that
the
ends
of
one
of
our
rods
could
be
made
to
coincide
with
these
two
points
for
how
else
should
we
define
the
distance
without
our
proceeding
being
in
the
highest
measure
grossly
arbitrary
the
method
of
cartesian
coordinates
must
then
be
discarded
and
replaced
by
another
which
does
not
assume
the
validity
of
euclidean
geometry
for
rigid
bodies
the
reader
will
notice
that
the
situation
depicted
here
corresponds
to
the
one
brought
about
by
the
general
postitlate
of
relativity
section
notes
mathematicians
have
been
confronted
with
our
problem
in
the
following
form
if
we
are
given
a
surface
e
g
an
ellipsoid
in
euclidean
three
dimensional
space
then
there
exists
for
this
surface
a
two
dimensional
geometry
just
as
much
as
for
a
plane
surface
gauss
undertook
the
task
of
treating
this
two
dimensional
geometry
from
first
principles
without
making
use
of
the
fact
that
the
surface
belongs
to
a
euclidean
continuum
of
three
dimensions
if
we
imagine
constructions
to
be
made
with
rigid
rods
in
the
surface
similar
to
that
above
with
the
marble
slab
we
should
find
that
different
laws
hold
for
these
from
those
resulting
on
the
basis
of
euclidean
plane
geometry
the
surface
is
not
a
euclidean
continuum
with
respect
to
the
rods
and
we
cannot
define
cartesian
co
ordinates
in
the
surface
gauss
indicated
the
principles
according
to
which
we
can
treat
the
geometrical
relationships
in
the
surface
and
thus
pointed
out
the
way
to
the
method
of
riemman
of
treating
multi
dimensional
non
euclidean
continuum
thus
it
is
that
mathematicians
long
ago
solved
the
formal
problems
to
which
we
are
led
by
the
general
postulate
of
relativity
gaussian
co
ordinates
according
to
gauss
this
combined
analytical
and
geometrical
mode
of
handling
the
problem
can
be
arrived
at
in
the
following
way
we
imagine
a
system
of
arbitrary
curves
see
fig
drawn
on
the
surface
of
the
table
these
we
designate
as
u
curves
and
we
indicate
each
of
them
by
means
of
a
number
the
curves
u
u
and
u
are
drawn
in
the
diagram
between
the
curves
u
and
u
we
must
imagine
an
infinitely
large
number
to
be
drawn
all
of
which
correspond
to
real
numbers
lying
between
and
fig
we
have
then
a
system
of
u
curves
and
this
infinitely
dense
system
covers
the
whole
surface
of
the
table
these
u
curves
must
not
intersect
each
other
and
through
each
point
of
the
surface
one
and
only
one
curve
must
pass
thus
a
perfectly
definite
value
of
u
belongs
to
every
point
on
the
surface
of
the
marble
slab
in
like
manner
we
imagine
a
system
of
v
curves
drawn
on
the
surface
these
satisfy
the
same
conditions
as
the
u
curves
they
are
provided
with
numbers
in
a
corresponding
manner
and
they
may
likewise
be
of
arbitrary
shape
it
follows
that
a
value
of
u
and
a
value
of
v
belong
to
every
point
on
the
surface
of
the
table
we
call
these
two
numbers
the
co
ordinates
of
the
surface
of
the
table
gaussian
co
ordinates
for
example
the
point
p
in
the
diagram
has
the
gaussian
co
ordinates
u
v
two
neighbouring
points
p
and
p
on
the
surface
then
correspond
to
the
co
ordinates
p
u
v
p
u
du
v
dv
where
du
and
dv
signify
very
small
numbers
in
a
similar
manner
we
may
indicate
the
distance
line
interval
between
p
and
p
as
measured
with
a
little
rod
by
means
of
the
very
small
number
ds
then
according
to
gauss
we
have
ds
g
du
g
dudv
g
dv
where
g
g
g
are
magnitudes
which
depend
in
a
perfectly
definite
way
on
u
and
v
the
magnitudes
g
g
and
g
determine
the
behaviour
of
the
rods
relative
to
the
u
curves
and
v
curves
and
thus
also
relative
to
the
surface
of
the
table
for
the
case
in
which
the
points
of
the
surface
considered
form
a
euclidean
continuum
with
reference
to
the
measuring
rods
but
only
in
this
case
it
is
possible
to
draw
the
u
curves
and
v
curves
and
to
attach
numbers
to
them
in
such
a
manner
that
we
simply
have
ds
du
dv
under
these
conditions
the
u
curves
and
v
curves
are
straight
lines
in
the
sense
of
euclidean
geometry
and
they
are
perpendicular
to
each
other
here
the
gaussian
coordinates
are
samply
cartesian
ones
it
is
clear
that
gauss
co
ordinates
are
nothing
more
than
an
association
of
two
sets
of
numbers
with
the
points
of
the
surface
considered
of
such
a
nature
that
numerical
values
differing
very
slightly
from
each
other
are
associated
with
neighbouring
points
in
space
so
far
these
considerations
hold
for
a
continuum
of
two
dimensions
but
the
gaussian
method
can
be
applied
also
to
a
continuum
of
three
four
or
more
dimensions
if
for
instance
a
continuum
of
four
dimensions
be
supposed
available
we
may
represent
it
in
the
following
way
with
every
point
of
the
continuum
we
associate
arbitrarily
four
numbers
x
x
x
x
which
are
known
as
co
ordinates
adjacent
points
correspond
to
adjacent
values
of
the
coordinates
if
a
distance
ds
is
associated
with
the
adjacent
points
p
and
p
this
distance
being
measurable
and
well
defined
from
a
physical
point
of
view
then
the
following
formula
holds
ds
g
dx
g
dx
dx
g
dx
where
the
magnitudes
g
etc
have
values
which
vary
with
the
position
in
the
continuum
only
when
the
continuum
is
a
euclidean
one
is
it
possible
to
associate
the
co
ordinates
x
x
with
the
points
of
the
continuum
so
that
we
have
simply
ds
dx
dx
dx
dx
in
this
case
relations
hold
in
the
four
dimensional
continuum
which
are
analogous
to
those
holding
in
our
three
dimensional
measurements
however
the
gauss
treatment
for
ds
which
we
have
given
above
is
not
always
possible
it
is
only
possible
when
sufficiently
small
regions
of
the
continuum
under
consideration
may
be
regarded
as
euclidean
continua
for
example
this
obviously
holds
in
the
case
of
the
marble
slab
of
the
table
and
local
variation
of
temperature
the
temperature
is
practically
constant
for
a
small
part
of
the
slab
and
thus
the
geometrical
behaviour
of
the
rods
is
almost
as
it
ought
to
be
according
to
the
rules
of
euclidean
geometry
hence
the
imperfections
of
the
construction
of
squares
in
the
previous
section
do
not
show
themselves
clearly
until
this
construction
is
extended
over
a
considerable
portion
of
the
surface
of
the
table
we
can
sum
this
up
as
follows
gauss
invented
a
method
for
the
mathematical
treatment
of
continua
in
general
in
which
size
relations
distances
between
neighbouring
points
are
defined
to
every
point
of
a
continuum
are
assigned
as
many
numbers
gaussian
coordinates
as
the
continuum
has
dimensions
this
is
done
in
such
a
way
that
only
one
meaning
can
be
attached
to
the
assignment
and
that
numbers
gaussian
coordinates
which
differ
by
an
indefinitely
small
amount
are
assigned
to
adjacent
points
the
gaussian
coordinate
system
is
a
logical
generalisation
of
the
cartesian
co
ordinate
system
it
is
also
applicable
to
non
euclidean
continua
but
only
when
with
respect
to
the
defined
size
or
distance
small
parts
of
the
continuum
under
consideration
behave
more
nearly
like
a
euclidean
system
the
smaller
the
part
of
the
continuum
under
our
notice
the
space
time
continuum
of
the
speical
theory
of
relativity
considered
as
a
euclidean
continuum
we
are
now
in
a
position
to
formulate
more
exactly
the
idea
of
minkowski
which
was
only
vaguely
indicated
in
section
in
accordance
with
the
special
theory
of
relativity
certain
co
ordinate
systems
are
given
preference
for
the
description
of
the
four
dimensional
space
time
continuum
we
called
these
galileian
co
ordinate
systems
for
these
systems
the
four
co
ordinates
x
y
z
t
which
determine
an
event
or
in
other
words
a
point
of
the
four
dimensional
continuum
are
defined
physically
in
a
simple
manner
as
set
forth
in
detail
in
the
first
part
of
this
book
for
the
transition
from
one
galileian
system
to
another
which
is
moving
uniformly
with
reference
to
the
first
the
equations
of
the
lorentz
transformation
are
valid
these
last
form
the
basis
for
the
derivation
of
deductions
from
the
special
theory
of
relativity
and
in
themselves
they
are
nothing
more
than
the
expression
of
the
universal
validity
of
the
law
of
transmission
of
light
for
all
galileian
systems
of
reference
minkowski
found
that
the
lorentz
transformations
satisfy
the
following
simple
conditions
let
us
consider
two
neighbouring
events
the
relative
position
of
which
in
the
four
dimensional
continuum
is
given
with
respect
to
a
galileian
reference
body
k
by
the
space
co
ordinate
differences
dx
dy
dz
and
the
time
difference
dt
with
reference
to
a
second
galileian
system
we
shall
suppose
that
the
corresponding
differences
for
these
two
events
are
dx
dy
dz
dt
then
these
magnitudes
always
fulfil
the
condition
dx
dy
dz
c
dt
dx
dy
dz
c
dt
the
validity
of
the
lorentz
transformation
follows
from
this
condition
we
can
express
this
as
follows
the
magnitude
ds
dx
dy
dz
c
dt
which
belongs
to
two
adjacent
points
of
the
four
dimensional
space
time
continuum
has
the
same
value
for
all
selected
galileian
reference
bodies
if
we
replace
x
y
z
sq
rt
i
ct
by
x
x
x
x
we
also
obtaill
the
result
that
ds
dx
dx
dx
dx
is
independent
of
the
choice
of
the
body
of
reference
we
call
the
magnitude
ds
the
distance
apart
of
the
two
events
or
four
dimensional
points
thus
if
we
choose
as
time
variable
the
imaginary
variable
sq
rt
i
ct
instead
of
the
real
quantity
t
we
can
regard
the
space
time
contintium
accordance
with
the
special
theory
of
relativity
as
a
euclidean
four
dimensional
continuum
a
result
which
follows
from
the
considerations
of
the
preceding
section
notes
cf
appendixes
i
and
the
relations
which
are
derived
there
for
the
co
ordlnates
themselves
are
valid
also
for
co
ordinate
differences
and
thus
also
for
co
ordinate
differentials
indefinitely
small
differences
the
space
time
continuum
of
the
general
theory
of
realtiivty
is
not
a
eculidean
continuum
in
the
first
part
of
this
book
we
were
able
to
make
use
of
space
time
co
ordinates
which
allowed
of
a
simple
and
direct
physical
interpretation
and
which
according
to
section
can
be
regarded
as
four
dimensional
cartesian
co
ordinates
this
was
possible
on
the
basis
of
the
law
of
the
constancy
of
the
velocity
of
tight
but
according
to
section
the
general
theory
of
relativity
cannot
retain
this
law
on
the
contrary
we
arrived
at
the
result
that
according
to
this
latter
theory
the
velocity
of
light
must
always
depend
on
the
co
ordinates
when
a
gravitational
field
is
present
in
connection
with
a
specific
illustration
in
section
we
found
that
the
presence
of
a
gravitational
field
invalidates
the
definition
of
the
coordinates
and
the
ifine
which
led
us
to
our
objective
in
the
special
theory
of
relativity
in
view
of
the
resuits
of
these
considerations
we
are
led
to
the
conviction
that
according
to
the
general
principle
of
relativity
the
space
time
continuum
cannot
be
regarded
as
a
euclidean
one
but
that
here
we
have
the
general
case
corresponding
to
the
marble
slab
with
local
variations
of
temperature
and
with
which
we
made
acquaintance
as
an
example
of
a
two
dimensional
continuum
just
as
it
was
there
impossible
to
construct
a
cartesian
co
ordinate
system
from
equal
rods
so
here
it
is
impossible
to
build
up
a
system
reference
body
from
rigid
bodies
and
clocks
which
shall
be
of
such
a
nature
that
measuring
rods
and
clocks
arranged
rigidly
with
respect
to
one
another
shaill
indicate
position
and
time
directly
such
was
the
essence
of
the
difficulty
with
which
we
were
confronted
in
section
but
the
considerations
of
sections
and
show
us
the
way
to
surmount
this
difficulty
we
refer
the
fourdimensional
space
time
continuum
in
an
arbitrary
manner
to
gauss
co
ordinates
we
assign
to
every
point
of
the
continuum
event
four
numbers
x
x
x
x
co
ordinates
which
have
not
the
least
direct
physical
significance
but
only
serve
the
purpose
of
numbering
the
points
of
the
continuum
in
a
definite
but
arbitrary
manner
this
arrangement
does
not
even
need
to
be
of
such
a
kind
that
we
must
regard
x
x
x
as
space
co
ordinates
and
x
as
a
time
co
ordinate
the
reader
may
think
that
such
a
description
of
the
world
would
be
quite
inadequate
what
does
it
mean
to
assign
to
an
event
the
particular
co
ordinates
x
x
x
x
if
in
themselves
these
co
ordinates
have
no
significance
more
careful
consideration
shows
however
that
this
anxiety
is
unfounded
let
us
consider
for
instance
a
material
point
with
any
kind
of
motion
if
this
point
had
only
a
momentary
existence
without
duration
then
it
would
to
described
in
space
time
by
a
single
system
of
values
x
x
x
x
thus
its
permanent
existence
must
be
characterised
by
an
infinitely
large
number
of
such
systems
of
values
the
co
ordinate
values
of
which
are
so
close
together
as
to
give
continuity
corresponding
to
the
material
point
we
thus
have
a
uni
dimensional
line
in
the
four
dimensional
continuum
in
the
same
way
any
such
lines
in
our
continuum
correspond
to
many
points
in
motion
the
only
statements
having
regard
to
these
points
which
can
claim
a
physical
existence
are
in
reality
the
statements
about
their
encounters
in
our
mathematical
treatment
such
an
encounter
is
expressed
in
the
fact
that
the
two
lines
which
represent
the
motions
of
the
points
in
question
have
a
particular
system
of
co
ordinate
values
x
x
x
x
in
common
after
mature
consideration
the
reader
will
doubtless
admit
that
in
reality
such
encounters
constitute
the
only
actual
evidence
of
a
time
space
nature
with
which
we
meet
in
physical
statements
when
we
were
describing
the
motion
of
a
material
point
relative
to
a
body
of
reference
we
stated
nothing
more
than
the
encounters
of
this
point
with
particular
points
of
the
reference
body
we
can
also
determine
the
corresponding
values
of
the
time
by
the
observation
of
encounters
of
the
body
with
clocks
in
conjunction
with
the
observation
of
the
encounter
of
the
hands
of
clocks
with
particular
points
on
the
dials
it
is
just
the
same
in
the
case
of
space
measurements
by
means
of
measuring
rods
as
a
litttle
consideration
will
show
the
following
statements
hold
generally
every
physical
description
resolves
itself
into
a
number
of
statements
each
of
which
refers
to
the
space
time
coincidence
of
two
events
a
and
b
in
terms
of
gaussian
co
ordinates
every
such
statement
is
expressed
by
the
agreement
of
their
four
co
ordinates
x
x
x
x
thus
in
reality
the
description
of
the
time
space
continuum
by
means
of
gauss
co
ordinates
completely
replaces
the
description
with
the
aid
of
a
body
of
reference
without
suffering
from
the
defects
of
the
latter
mode
of
description
it
is
not
tied
down
to
the
euclidean
character
of
the
continuum
which
has
to
be
represented
exact
formulation
of
the
general
principle
of
relativity
we
are
now
in
a
position
to
replace
the
pro
visional
formulation
of
the
general
principle
of
relativity
given
in
section
by
an
exact
formulation
the
form
there
used
all
bodies
of
reference
k
k
etc
are
equivalent
for
the
description
of
natural
phenomena
formulation
of
the
general
laws
of
nature
whatever
may
be
their
state
of
motion
cannot
be
maintained
because
the
use
of
rigid
reference
bodies
in
the
sense
of
the
method
followed
in
the
special
theory
of
relativity
is
in
general
not
possible
in
space
time
description
the
gauss
co
ordinate
system
has
to
take
the
place
of
the
body
of
reference
the
following
statement
corresponds
to
the
fundamental
idea
of
the
general
principle
of
relativity
all
gaussian
co
ordinate
systems
are
essentially
equivalent
for
the
formulation
of
the
general
laws
of
nature
we
can
state
this
general
principle
of
relativity
in
still
another
form
which
renders
it
yet
more
clearly
intelligible
than
it
is
when
in
the
form
of
the
natural
extension
of
the
special
principle
of
relativity
according
to
the
special
theory
of
relativity
the
equations
which
express
the
general
laws
of
nature
pass
over
into
equations
of
the
same
form
when
by
making
use
of
the
lorentz
transformation
we
replace
the
space
time
variables
x
y
z
t
of
a
galileian
reference
body
k
by
the
space
time
variables
x
y
z
t
of
a
new
reference
body
k
according
to
the
general
theory
of
relativity
on
the
other
hand
by
application
of
arbitrary
substitutions
of
the
gauss
variables
x
x
x
x
the
equations
must
pass
over
into
equations
of
the
same
form
for
every
transformation
not
only
the
lorentz
transformation
corresponds
to
the
transition
of
one
gauss
co
ordinate
system
into
another
if
we
desire
to
adhere
to
our
old
time
three
dimensional
view
of
things
then
we
can
characterise
the
development
which
is
being
undergone
by
the
fundamental
idea
of
the
general
theory
of
relativity
as
follows
the
special
theory
of
relativity
has
reference
to
galileian
domains
i
e
to
those
in
which
no
gravitational
field
exists
in
this
connection
a
galileian
reference
body
serves
as
body
of
reference
i
e
a
rigid
body
the
state
of
motion
of
which
is
so
chosen
that
the
galileian
law
of
the
uniform
rectilinear
motion
of
isolated
material
points
holds
relatively
to
it
certain
considerations
suggest
that
we
should
refer
the
same
galileian
domains
to
non
galileian
reference
bodies
also
a
gravitational
field
of
a
special
kind
is
then
present
with
respect
to
these
bodies
cf
sections
and
in
gravitational
fields
there
are
no
such
things
as
rigid
bodies
with
euclidean
properties
thus
the
fictitious
rigid
body
of
reference
is
of
no
avail
in
the
general
theory
of
relativity
the
motion
of
clocks
is
also
influenced
by
gravitational
fields
and
in
such
a
way
that
a
physical
definition
of
time
which
is
made
directly
with
the
aid
of
clocks
has
by
no
means
the
same
degree
of
plausibility
as
in
the
special
theory
of
relativity
for
this
reason
non
rigid
reference
bodies
are
used
which
are
as
a
whole
not
only
moving
in
any
way
whatsoever
but
which
also
suffer
alterations
in
form
ad
lib
during
their
motion
clocks
for
which
the
law
of
motion
is
of
any
kind
however
irregular
serve
for
the
definition
of
time
we
have
to
imagine
each
of
these
clocks
fixed
at
a
point
on
the
non
rigid
reference
body
these
clocks
satisfy
only
the
one
condition
that
the
readings
which
are
observed
simultaneously
on
adjacent
clocks
in
space
differ
from
each
other
by
an
indefinitely
small
amount
this
non
rigid
reference
body
which
might
appropriately
be
termed
a
reference
mollusc
is
in
the
main
equivalent
to
a
gaussian
four
dimensional
co
ordinate
system
chosen
arbitrarily
that
which
gives
the
mollusc
a
certain
comprehensibility
as
compared
with
the
gauss
co
ordinate
system
is
the
really
unjustified
formal
retention
of
the
separate
existence
of
the
space
co
ordinates
as
opposed
to
the
time
co
ordinate
every
point
on
the
mollusc
is
treated
as
a
space
point
and
every
material
point
which
is
at
rest
relatively
to
it
as
at
rest
so
long
as
the
mollusc
is
considered
as
reference
body
the
general
principle
of
relativity
requires
that
all
these
molluscs
can
be
used
as
reference
bodies
with
equal
right
and
equal
success
in
the
formulation
of
the
general
laws
of
nature
the
laws
themselves
must
be
quite
independent
of
the
choice
of
mollusc
the
great
power
possessed
by
the
general
principle
of
relativity
lies
in
the
comprehensive
limitation
which
is
imposed
on
the
laws
of
nature
in
consequence
of
what
we
have
seen
above
the
solution
of
the
problem
of
gravitation
on
the
basis
of
the
general
principle
of
relativity
if
the
reader
has
followed
all
our
previous
considerations
he
will
have
no
further
difficulty
in
understanding
the
methods
leading
to
the
solution
of
the
problem
of
gravitation
we
start
off
on
a
consideration
of
a
galileian
domain
i
e
a
domain
in
which
there
is
no
gravitational
field
relative
to
the
galileian
reference
body
k
the
behaviour
of
measuring
rods
and
clocks
with
reference
to
k
is
known
from
the
special
theory
of
relativity
likewise
the
behaviour
of
isolated
material
points
the
latter
move
uniformly
and
in
straight
lines
now
let
us
refer
this
domain
to
a
random
gauss
coordinate
system
or
to
a
mollusc
as
reference
body
k
then
with
respect
to
k
there
is
a
gravitational
field
g
of
a
particular
kind
we
learn
the
behaviour
of
measuring
rods
and
clocks
and
also
of
freely
moving
material
points
with
reference
to
k
simply
by
mathematical
transformation
we
interpret
this
behaviour
as
the
behaviour
of
measuring
rods
docks
and
material
points
tinder
the
influence
of
the
gravitational
field
g
hereupon
we
introduce
a
hypothesis
that
the
influence
of
the
gravitational
field
on
measuringrods
clocks
and
freely
moving
material
points
continues
to
take
place
according
to
the
same
laws
even
in
the
case
where
the
prevailing
gravitational
field
is
not
derivable
from
the
galfleian
special
care
simply
by
means
of
a
transformation
of
co
ordinates
the
next
step
is
to
investigate
the
space
time
behaviour
of
the
gravitational
field
g
which
was
derived
from
the
galileian
special
case
simply
by
transformation
of
the
coordinates
this
behaviour
is
formulated
in
a
law
which
is
always
valid
no
matter
how
the
reference
body
mollusc
used
in
the
description
may
be
chosen
this
law
is
not
yet
the
general
law
of
the
gravitational
field
since
the
gravitational
field
under
consideration
is
of
a
special
kind
in
order
to
find
out
the
general
law
of
field
of
gravitation
we
still
require
to
obtain
a
generalisation
of
the
law
as
found
above
this
can
be
obtained
without
caprice
however
by
taking
into
consideration
the
following
demands
a
the
required
generalisation
must
likewise
satisfy
the
general
postulate
of
relativity
b
if
there
is
any
matter
in
the
domain
under
consideration
only
its
inertial
mass
and
thus
according
to
section
only
its
energy
is
of
importance
for
its
etfect
in
exciting
a
field
c
gravitational
field
and
matter
together
must
satisfy
the
law
of
the
conservation
of
energy
and
of
impulse
finally
the
general
principle
of
relativity
permits
us
to
determine
the
influence
of
the
gravitational
field
on
the
course
of
all
those
processes
which
take
place
according
to
known
laws
when
a
gravitational
field
is
absent
i
e
which
have
already
been
fitted
into
the
frame
of
the
special
theory
of
relativity
in
this
connection
we
proceed
in
principle
according
to
the
method
which
has
already
been
explained
for
measuring
rods
clocks
and
freely
moving
material
points
the
theory
of
gravitation
derived
in
this
way
from
the
general
postulate
of
relativity
excels
not
only
in
its
beauty
nor
in
removing
the
defect
attaching
to
classical
mechanics
which
was
brought
to
light
in
section
nor
in
interpreting
the
empirical
law
of
the
equality
of
inertial
and
gravitational
mass
but
it
has
also
already
explained
a
result
of
observation
in
astronomy
against
which
classical
mechanics
is
powerless
if
we
confine
the
application
of
the
theory
to
the
case
where
the
gravitational
fields
can
be
regarded
as
being
weak
and
in
which
all
masses
move
with
respect
to
the
coordinate
system
with
velocities
which
are
small
compared
with
the
velocity
of
light
we
then
obtain
as
a
first
approximation
the
newtonian
theory
thus
the
latter
theory
is
obtained
here
without
any
particular
assumption
whereas
newton
had
to
introduce
the
hypothesis
that
the
force
of
attraction
between
mutually
attracting
material
points
is
inversely
proportional
to
the
square
of
the
distance
between
them
if
we
increase
the
accuracy
of
the
calculation
deviations
from
the
theory
of
newton
make
their
appearance
practically
all
of
which
must
nevertheless
escape
the
test
of
observation
owing
to
their
smallness
we
must
draw
attention
here
to
one
of
these
deviations
according
to
newtons
theory
a
planet
moves
round
the
sun
in
an
ellipse
which
would
permanently
maintain
its
position
with
respect
to
the
fixed
stars
if
we
could
disregard
the
motion
of
the
fixed
stars
themselves
and
the
action
of
the
other
planets
under
consideration
thus
if
we
correct
the
observed
motion
of
the
planets
for
these
two
influences
and
if
newtons
theory
be
strictly
correct
we
ought
to
obtain
for
the
orbit
of
the
planet
an
ellipse
which
is
fixed
with
reference
to
the
fixed
stars
this
deduction
which
can
be
tested
with
great
accuracy
has
been
confirmed
for
all
the
planets
save
one
with
the
precision
that
is
capable
of
being
obtained
by
the
delicacy
of
observation
attainable
at
the
present
time
the
sole
exception
is
mercury
the
planet
which
lies
nearest
the
sun
since
the
time
of
leverrier
it
has
been
known
that
the
ellipse
corresponding
to
the
orbit
of
mercury
after
it
has
been
corrected
for
the
influences
mentioned
above
is
not
stationary
with
respect
to
the
fixed
stars
but
that
it
rotates
exceedingly
slowly
in
the
plane
of
the
orbit
and
in
the
sense
of
the
orbital
motion
the
value
obtained
for
this
rotary
movement
of
the
orbital
ellipse
was
seconds
of
arc
per
century
an
amount
ensured
to
be
correct
to
within
a
few
seconds
of
arc
this
effect
can
be
explained
by
means
of
classical
mechanics
only
on
the
assumption
of
hypotheses
which
have
little
probability
and
which
were
devised
solely
for
this
purponse
on
the
basis
of
the
general
theory
of
relativity
it
is
found
that
the
ellipse
of
every
planet
round
the
sun
must
necessarily
rotate
in
the
manner
indicated
above
that
for
all
the
planets
with
the
exception
of
mercury
this
rotation
is
too
small
to
be
detected
with
the
delicacy
of
observation
possible
at
the
present
time
but
that
in
the
case
of
mercury
it
must
amount
to
seconds
of
arc
per
century
a
result
which
is
strictly
in
agreement
with
observation
apart
from
this
one
it
has
hitherto
been
possible
to
make
only
two
deductions
from
the
theory
which
admit
of
being
tested
by
observation
to
wit
the
curvature
of
light
rays
by
the
gravitational
field
of
the
sun
x
and
a
displacement
of
the
spectral
lines
of
light
reaching
us
from
large
stars
as
compared
with
the
corresponding
lines
for
light
produced
in
an
analogous
manner
terrestrially
i
e
by
the
same
kind
of
atom
these
two
deductions
from
the
theory
have
both
been
confirmed

considerations
on
the
universe
as
a
whole
cosmological
difficulties
of
newtons
theory
part
from
the
difficulty
discussed
in
section
there
is
a
second
fundamental
difficulty
attending
classical
celestial
mechanics
which
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
was
first
discussed
in
detail
by
the
astronomer
seeliger
if
we
ponder
over
the
question
as
to
how
the
universe
considered
as
a
whole
is
to
be
regarded
the
first
answer
that
suggests
itself
to
us
is
surely
this
as
regards
space
and
time
the
universe
is
infinite
there
are
stars
everywhere
so
that
the
density
of
matter
although
very
variable
in
detail
is
nevertheless
on
the
average
everywhere
the
same
in
other
words
however
far
we
might
travel
through
space
we
should
find
everywhere
an
attenuated
swarm
of
fixed
stars
of
approrimately
the
same
kind
and
density
this
view
is
not
in
harmony
with
the
theory
of
newton
the
latter
theory
rather
requires
that
the
universe
should
have
a
kind
of
centre
in
which
the
density
of
the
stars
is
a
maximum
and
that
as
we
proceed
outwards
from
this
centre
the
group
density
of
the
stars
should
diminish
until
finally
at
great
distances
it
is
succeeded
by
an
infinite
region
of
emptiness
the
stellar
universe
ought
to
be
a
finite
island
in
the
infinite
ocean
of
space
this
conception
is
in
itself
not
very
satisfactory
it
is
still
less
satisfactory
because
it
leads
to
the
result
that
the
light
emitted
by
the
stars
and
also
individual
stars
of
the
stellar
system
are
perpetually
passing
out
into
infinite
space
never
to
return
and
without
ever
again
coming
into
interaction
with
other
objects
of
nature
such
a
finite
material
universe
would
be
destined
to
become
gradually
but
systematically
impoverished
in
order
to
escape
this
dilemma
seeliger
suggested
a
modification
of
newtons
law
in
which
he
assumes
that
for
great
distances
the
force
of
attraction
between
two
masses
diminishes
more
rapidly
than
would
result
from
the
inverse
square
law
in
this
way
it
is
possible
for
the
mean
density
of
matter
to
be
constant
everywhere
even
to
infinity
without
infinitely
large
gravitational
fields
being
produced
we
thus
free
ourselves
from
the
distasteful
conception
that
the
material
universe
ought
to
possess
something
of
the
nature
of
a
centre
of
course
we
purchase
our
emancipation
from
the
fundamental
difficulties
mentioned
at
the
cost
of
a
modification
and
complication
of
newtons
law
which
has
neither
empirical
nor
theoretical
foundation
we
can
imagine
innumerable
laws
which
would
serve
the
same
purpose
without
our
being
able
to
state
a
reason
why
one
of
them
is
to
be
preferred
to
the
others
for
any
one
of
these
laws
would
be
founded
just
as
little
on
more
general
theoretical
principles
as
is
the
law
of
newton
notes
proof
according
to
the
theory
of
newton
the
number
of
lines
of
force
which
come
from
infinity
and
terminate
in
a
mass
m
is
proportional
to
the
mass
m
if
on
the
average
the
mass
density
p
is
constant
throughout
tithe
universe
then
a
sphere
of
volume
v
will
enclose
the
average
man
p
v
thus
the
number
of
lines
of
force
passing
through
the
surface
f
of
the
sphere
into
its
interior
is
proportional
to
p
v
for
unit
area
of
the
surface
of
the
sphere
the
number
of
lines
of
force
which
enters
the
sphere
is
thus
proportional
to
p
v
f
or
to
p
r
hence
the
intensity
of
the
field
at
the
surface
would
ultimately
become
infinite
with
increasing
radius
r
of
the
sphere
which
is
impossible
the
possibility
of
a
finite
and
yet
unbounded
universe
but
speculations
on
the
structure
of
the
universe
also
move
in
quite
another
direction
the
development
of
non
euclidean
geometry
led
to
the
recognition
of
the
fact
that
we
can
cast
doubt
on
the
infiniteness
of
our
space
without
coming
into
conflict
with
the
laws
of
thought
or
with
experience
riemann
helmholtz
these
questions
have
already
been
treated
in
detail
and
with
unsurpassable
lucidity
by
helmholtz
and
poincar
whereas
i
can
only
touch
on
them
briefly
here
in
the
first
place
we
imagine
an
existence
in
two
dimensional
space
flat
beings
with
flat
implements
and
in
particular
flat
rigid
measuring
rods
are
free
to
move
in
a
plane
for
them
nothing
exists
outside
of
this
plane
that
which
they
observe
to
happen
to
themselves
and
to
their
flat
things
is
the
all
inclusive
reality
of
their
plane
in
particular
the
constructions
of
plane
euclidean
geometry
can
be
carried
out
by
means
of
the
rods
e
g
the
lattice
construction
considered
in
section
in
contrast
to
ours
the
universe
of
these
beings
is
two
dimensional
but
like
ours
it
extends
to
infinity
in
their
universe
there
is
room
for
an
infinite
number
of
identical
squares
made
up
of
rods
i
e
its
volume
surface
is
infinite
if
these
beings
say
their
universe
is
plane
there
is
sense
in
the
statement
because
they
mean
that
they
can
perform
the
constructions
of
plane
euclidean
geometry
with
their
rods
in
this
connection
the
individual
rods
always
represent
the
same
distance
independently
of
their
position
let
us
consider
now
a
second
two
dimensional
existence
but
this
time
on
a
spherical
surface
instead
of
on
a
plane
the
flat
beings
with
their
measuring
rods
and
other
objects
fit
exactly
on
this
surface
and
they
are
unable
to
leave
it
their
whole
universe
of
observation
extends
exclusively
over
the
surface
of
the
sphere
are
these
beings
able
to
regard
the
geometry
of
their
universe
as
being
plane
geometry
and
their
rods
withal
as
the
realisation
of
distance
they
cannot
do
this
for
if
they
attempt
to
realise
a
straight
line
they
will
obtain
a
curve
which
we
three
dimensional
beings
designate
as
a
great
circle
i
e
a
self
contained
line
of
definite
finite
length
which
can
be
measured
up
by
means
of
a
measuring
rod
similarly
this
universe
has
a
finite
area
that
can
be
compared
with
the
area
of
a
square
constructed
with
rods
the
great
charm
resulting
from
this
consideration
lies
in
the
recognition
of
the
fact
that
the
universe
of
these
beings
is
finite
and
yet
has
no
limits
but
the
spherical
surface
beings
do
not
need
to
go
on
a
world
tour
in
order
to
perceive
that
they
are
not
living
in
a
euclidean
universe
they
can
convince
themselves
of
this
on
every
part
of
their
world
provided
they
do
not
use
too
small
a
piece
of
it
starting
from
a
point
they
draw
straight
lines
arcs
of
circles
as
judged
in
three
dimensional
space
of
equal
length
in
all
directions
they
will
call
the
line
joining
the
free
ends
of
these
lines
a
circle
for
a
plane
surface
the
ratio
of
the
circumference
of
a
circle
to
its
diameter
both
lengths
being
measured
with
the
same
rod
is
according
to
euclidean
geometry
of
the
plane
equal
to
a
constant
value
p
which
is
independent
of
the
diameter
of
the
circle
on
their
spherical
surface
our
flat
beings
would
find
for
this
ratio
the
value
eq
file
eq
gif
i
e
a
smaller
value
than
p
the
difference
being
the
more
considerable
the
greater
is
the
radius
of
the
circle
in
comparison
with
the
radius
r
of
the
world
sphere
by
means
of
this
relation
the
spherical
beings
can
determine
the
radius
of
their
universe
world
even
when
only
a
relatively
small
part
of
their
worldsphere
is
available
for
their
measurements
but
if
this
part
is
very
small
indeed
they
will
no
longer
be
able
to
demonstrate
that
they
are
on
a
spherical
world
and
not
on
a
euclidean
plane
for
a
small
part
of
a
spherical
surface
differs
only
slightly
from
a
piece
of
a
plane
of
the
same
size
thus
if
the
spherical
surface
beings
are
living
on
a
planet
of
which
the
solar
system
occupies
only
a
negligibly
small
part
of
the
spherical
universe
they
have
no
means
of
determining
whether
they
are
living
in
a
finite
or
in
an
infinite
universe
because
the
piece
of
universe
to
which
they
have
access
is
in
both
cases
practically
plane
or
euclidean
it
follows
directly
from
this
discussion
that
for
our
sphere
beings
the
circumference
of
a
circle
first
increases
with
the
radius
until
the
circumference
of
the
universe
is
reached
and
that
it
thenceforward
gradually
decreases
to
zero
for
still
further
increasing
values
of
the
radius
during
this
process
the
area
of
the
circle
continues
to
increase
more
and
more
until
finally
it
becomes
equal
to
the
total
area
of
the
whole
world
sphere
perhaps
the
reader
will
wonder
why
we
have
placed
our
beings
on
a
sphere
rather
than
on
another
closed
surface
but
this
choice
has
its
justification
in
the
fact
that
of
all
closed
surfaces
the
sphere
is
unique
in
possessing
the
property
that
all
points
on
it
are
equivalent
i
admit
that
the
ratio
of
the
circumference
c
of
a
circle
to
its
radius
r
depends
on
r
but
for
a
given
value
of
r
it
is
the
same
for
all
points
of
the
worldsphere
in
other
words
the
world
sphere
is
a
surface
of
constant
curvature
to
this
two
dimensional
sphere
universe
there
is
a
three
dimensional
analogy
namely
the
three
dimensional
spherical
space
which
was
discovered
by
riemann
its
points
are
likewise
all
equivalent
it
possesses
a
finite
volume
which
is
determined
by
its
radius
p
r
is
it
possible
to
imagine
a
spherical
space
to
imagine
a
space
means
nothing
else
than
that
we
imagine
an
epitome
of
our
space
experience
i
e
of
experience
that
we
can
have
in
the
movement
of
rigid
bodies
in
this
sense
we
can
imagine
a
spherical
space
suppose
we
draw
lines
or
stretch
strings
in
all
directions
from
a
point
and
mark
off
from
each
of
these
the
distance
r
with
a
measuring
rod
all
the
free
end
points
of
these
lengths
lie
on
a
spherical
surface
we
can
specially
measure
up
the
area
f
of
this
surface
by
means
of
a
square
made
up
of
measuring
rods
if
the
universe
is
euclidean
then
f
pr
if
it
is
spherical
then
f
is
always
less
than
pr
with
increasing
values
of
r
f
increases
from
zero
up
to
a
maximum
value
which
is
determined
by
the
world
radius
but
for
still
further
increasing
values
of
r
the
area
gradually
diminishes
to
zero
at
first
the
straight
lines
which
radiate
from
the
starting
point
diverge
farther
and
farther
from
one
another
but
later
they
approach
each
other
and
finally
they
run
together
again
at
a
counter
point
to
the
starting
point
under
such
conditions
they
have
traversed
the
whole
spherical
space
it
is
easily
seen
that
the
three
dimensional
spherical
space
is
quite
analogous
to
the
two
dimensional
spherical
surface
it
is
finite
i
e
of
finite
volume
and
has
no
bounds
it
may
be
mentioned
that
there
is
yet
another
kind
of
curved
space
elliptical
space
it
can
be
regarded
as
a
curved
space
in
which
the
two
counter
points
are
identical
indistinguishable
from
each
other
an
elliptical
universe
can
thus
be
considered
to
some
extent
as
a
curved
universe
possessing
central
symmetry
it
follows
from
what
has
been
said
that
closed
spaces
without
limits
are
conceivable
from
amongst
these
the
spherical
space
and
the
elliptical
excels
in
its
simplicity
since
all
points
on
it
are
equivalent
as
a
result
of
this
discussion
a
most
interesting
question
arises
for
astronomers
and
physicists
and
that
is
whether
the
universe
in
which
we
live
is
infinite
or
whether
it
is
finite
in
the
manner
of
the
spherical
universe
our
experience
is
far
from
being
sufficient
to
enable
us
to
answer
this
question
but
the
general
theory
of
relativity
permits
of
our
answering
it
with
a
moduate
degree
of
certainty
and
in
this
connection
the
difficulty
mentioned
in
section
finds
its
solution
the
structure
of
space
according
to
the
general
theory
of
relativity
according
to
the
general
theory
of
relativity
the
geometrical
properties
of
space
are
not
independent
but
they
are
determined
by
matter
thus
we
can
draw
conclusions
about
the
geometrical
structure
of
the
universe
only
if
we
base
our
considerations
on
the
state
of
the
matter
as
being
something
that
is
known
we
know
from
experience
that
for
a
suitably
chosen
co
ordinate
system
the
velocities
of
the
stars
are
small
as
compared
with
the
velocity
of
transmission
of
light
we
can
thus
as
a
rough
approximation
arrive
at
a
conclusion
as
to
the
nature
of
the
universe
as
a
whole
if
we
treat
the
matter
as
being
at
rest
we
already
know
from
our
previous
discussion
that
the
behaviour
of
measuring
rods
and
clocks
is
influenced
by
gravitational
fields
i
e
by
the
distribution
of
matter
this
in
itself
is
sufficient
to
exclude
the
possibility
of
the
exact
validity
of
euclidean
geometry
in
our
universe
but
it
is
conceivable
that
our
universe
differs
only
slightly
from
a
euclidean
one
and
this
notion
seems
all
the
more
probable
since
calculations
show
that
the
metrics
of
surrounding
space
is
influenced
only
to
an
exceedingly
small
extent
by
masses
even
of
the
magnitude
of
our
sun
we
might
imagine
that
as
regards
geometry
our
universe
behaves
analogously
to
a
surface
which
is
irregularly
curved
in
its
individual
parts
but
which
nowhere
departs
appreciably
from
a
plane
something
like
the
rippled
surface
of
a
lake
such
a
universe
might
fittingly
be
called
a
quasi
euclidean
universe
as
regards
its
space
it
would
be
infinite
but
calculation
shows
that
in
a
quasi
euclidean
universe
the
average
density
of
matter
would
necessarily
be
nil
thus
such
a
universe
could
not
be
inhabited
by
matter
everywhere
it
would
present
to
us
that
unsatisfactory
picture
which
we
portrayed
in
section
if
we
are
to
have
in
the
universe
an
average
density
of
matter
which
differs
from
zero
however
small
may
be
that
difference
then
the
universe
cannot
be
quasi
euclidean
on
the
contrary
the
results
of
calculation
indicate
that
if
matter
be
distributed
uniformly
the
universe
would
necessarily
be
spherical
or
elliptical
since
in
reality
the
detailed
distribution
of
matter
is
not
uniform
the
real
universe
will
deviate
in
individual
parts
from
the
spherical
i
e
the
universe
will
be
quasi
spherical
but
it
will
be
necessarily
finite
in
fact
the
theory
supplies
us
with
a
simple
connection
between
the
space
expanse
of
the
universe
and
the

coincide
in
the
present
case
we
can
divide
the
problem
into
parts
by
considering
first
only
events
which
are
localised
on
the
x
axis
any
such
event
is
represented
with
respect
to
the
co
ordinate
system
k
by
the
abscissa
x
and
the
time
t
and
with
respect
to
the
system
k
by
the
abscissa
x
and
the
time
t
we
require
to
find
x
and
t
when
x
and
t
are
given
a
light
signal
which
is
proceeding
along
the
positive
axis
of
x
is
transmitted
according
to
the
equation
x
ct
or
x
ct
since
the
same
light
signal
has
to
be
transmitted
relative
to
k
with
the
velocity
c
the
propagation
relative
to
the
system
k
will
be
represented
by
the
analogous
formula
x
ct
o
those
space
time
points
events
which
satisfy
x
must
also
satisfy
obviously
this
will
be
the
case
when
the
relation
x
ct
l
x
ct
is
fulfilled
in
general
where
l
indicates
a
constant
for
according
to
the
disappearance
of
x
ct
involves
the
disappearance
of
x
ct
if
we
apply
quite
similar
considerations
to
light
rays
which
are
being
transmitted
along
the
negative
x
axis
we
obtain
the
condition
x
ct
x
ct
by
adding
or
subtracting
equations
and
and
introducing
for
convenience
the
constants
a
and
b
in
place
of
the
constants
l
and
where
eq
file
eq
gif
and
eq
file
eq

we
obtain
the
equations
eq
file
eq

we
should
thus
have
the
solution
of
our
problem
if
the
constants
a
and
b
were
known
these
result
from
the
following
discussion
for
the
origin
of
k
we
have
permanently
x
and
hence
according
to
the
first
of
the
equations
eq
file
eq
gif
if
we
call
v
the
velocity
with
which
the
origin
of
k
is
moving
relative
to
k
we
then
have
eq
file
eq
gif
the
same
value
v
can
be
obtained
from
equations
if
we
calculate
the
velocity
of
another
point
of
k
relative
to
k
or
the
velocity
directed
towards
the
negative
x
axis
of
a
point
of
k
with
respect
to
k
in
short
we
can
designate
v
as
the
relative
velocity
of
the
two
systems
furthermore
the
principle
of
relativity
teaches
us
that
as
judged
from
k
the
length
of
a
unit
measuring
rod
which
is
at
rest
with
reference
to
k
must
be
exactly
the
same
as
the
length
as
judged
from
k
of
a
unit
measuring
rod
which
is
at
rest
relative
to
k
in
order
to
see
how
the
points
of
the
x
axis
appear
as
viewed
from
k
we
only
require
to
take
a
snapshot
of
k
from
k
this
means
that
we
have
to
insert
a
particular
value
of
t
time
of
k
e
g
t
for
this
value
of
t
we
then
obtain
from
the
first
of
the
equations
x
ax
two
points
of
the
x
axis
which
are
separated
by
the
distance
dx
i
when
measured
in
the
k
system
are
thus
separated
in
our
instantaneous
photograph
by
the
distance
eq

eq

but
if
the
snapshot
be
taken
from
k
t
and
if
we
eliminate
t
from
the
equations
taking
into
account
the
expression
we
obtain
eq
file
eq
gif
from
this
we
conclude
that
two
points
on
the
x
axis
separated
by
the
distance
i
relative
to
k
will
be
represented
on
our
snapshot
by
the
distance
eq
file
eq
gif
but
from
what
has
been
said
the
two
snapshots
must
be
identical
hence
dx
in
must
be
equal
to
dx
in
a
so
that
we
obtain
eq

eq

the
equations
and
b
determine
the
constants
a
and
b
by
inserting
the
values
of
these
constants
in
we
obtain
the
first
and
the
fourth
of
the
equations
given
in
section
eq

eq

thus
we
have
obtained
the
lorentz
transformation
for
events
on
the
x
axis
it
satisfies
the
condition

x
c
t
a
the
extension
of
this
result
to
include
events
which
take
place
outside
the
x
axis
is
obtained
by
retaining
equations
and
supplementing
them
by
the
relations
eq
file
eq

in
this
way
we
satisfy
the
postulate
of
the
constancy
of
the
velocity
of
light
in
vacuo
for
rays
of
light
of
arbitrary
direction
both
for
the
system
k
and
for
the
system
k
this
may
be
shown
in
the
following
manner
we
suppose
a
light
signal
sent
out
from
the
origin
of
k
at
the
time
t
it
will
be
propagated
according
to
the
equation
eq

or
if
we
square
this
equation
according
to
the
equation

y

c
t
it
is
required
by
the
law
of
propagation
of
light
in
conjunction
with
the
postulate
of
relativity
that
the
transmission
of
the
signal
in
question
should
take
place
as
judged
from
k
in
accordance
with
the
corresponding
formula

that

may
be
a
consequence
of

we
must
have

since
equation
a
must
hold
for
points
on
the
x

we
thus
have
s

it
is
easily
seen
that
the
lorentz
transformation
really
satisfies
equation
for
s
i
for
is
a
consequence
of
a
and
and
hence
also
of
and
we
have
thus
derived
the
lorentz
transformation
the
lorentz
transformation
represented
by
and
still
requires
to
be
generalised
obviously
it
is
immaterial
whether
the
axes
of
k
be
chosen
so
that
they
are
spatially
parallel
to
those
of
k
it
is
also
not
essential
that
the
velocity
of
translation
of
k
with
respect
to
k
should
be
in
the
direction
of
the
x
axis
a
simple
consideration
shows
that
we
are
able
to
construct
the
lorentz
transformation
in
this
general
sense
from
two
kinds
of
transformations
viz
from
lorentz
transformations
in
the
special
sense
and
from
purely
spatial
transformations
which
corresponds
to
the
replacement
of
the
rectangular
co
ordinate
system
by
a
new
system
with
its
axes
pointing
in
other
directions
mathematically
we
can
characterise
the
generalised
lorentz
transformation
thus
it
expresses
x
y
x
t
in
terms
of
linear
homogeneous
functions
of
x
y
x
t
of
such
a
kind
that
the
relation
x
y
z
c
t
x
y
z
c
t
a
is
satisficd
identically
that
is
to
say
if
we
substitute
their
expressions
in
x
y
x
t
in
place
of
x
y
x
t
on
the
left
hand

then
the
left
hand
side
of

agrees
with
the
right

side
appendix

minkowskis

supplementary
to
section
we
can
characterise
the
lorentz
transformation
still
more
simply
if
we
introduce
the
imaginary

in
place
of
t
as
time
variable
if
in

with
this
we
insert
x

and
similarly
for
the

then
the

which
is

by

can
be
expressed

we

from

exactly
the

way
as

it
is
due
to
this

that

iii
the
experimental
confirmation
of
the
general
theory
of
relativity
from
a
systematic
theoretical
point
of
view
we
may
imagine
the
process
of
evolution
of
an
empirical
science
to
be
a
continuous
process
of
induction
theories
are
evolved
and
are
expressed
in
short
compass
as
statements
of
a
large
number
of
individual
observations
in
the
form
of
empirical
laws
from
which
the
general
laws
can
be
ascertained
by
comparison
regarded
in
this
way
the
development
of
a
science
bears
some
resemblance
to
the
compilation
of
a
classified
catalogue
it
is
as
it
were
a
purely
empirical
enterprise
but
this
point
of
view
by
no
means
embraces
the
whole
of
the
actual
process
for
it
slurs
over
the
important
part
played
by
intuition
and
deductive
thought
in
the
development
of
an
exact
science
as
soon
as
a
science
has
emerged
from
its
initial
stages
theoretical
advances
are
no
longer
achieved
merely
by
a
process
of
arrangement
guided
by
empirical
data
the
investigator
rather
develops
a
system
of
thought
which
in
general
is
built
up
logically
from
a
small
number
of
fundamental
assumptions
the
so
called
axioms
we
call
such
a
system
of
thought
a
theory
the
theory
finds
the
justification
for
its
existence
in
the
fact
that
it
correlates
a
large
number
of
single
observations
and
it
is
just
here
that
the
truth
of
the
theory
lies
corresponding
to
the
same
complex
of
empirical
data
there
may
be
several
theories
which
differ
from
one
another
to
a
considerable
extent
but
as
regards
the
deductions
from
the
theories
which
are
capable
of
being
tested
the
agreement
between
the
theories
may
be
so
complete
that
it
becomes
difficult
to
find
any
deductions
in
which
the
two
theories
differ
from
each
other
as
an
example
a
case
of
general
interest
is
available
in
the
province
of
biology
in
the
darwinian
theory
of
the
development
of
species
by
selection
in
the
struggle
for
existence
and
in
the
theory
of
development
which
is
based
on
the
hypothesis
of
the
hereditary
transmission
of
acquired
characters
we
have
another
instance
of
far
reaching
agreement
between
the
deductions
from
two
theories
in
newtonian
mechanics
on
the
one
hand
and
the
general
theory
of
relativity
on
the
other
this
agreement
goes
so
far
that
up
to
the
preseat
we
have
been
able
to
find
only
a
few
deductions
from
the
general
theory
of
relativity
which
are
capable
of
investigation
and
to
which
the
physics
of
pre
relativity
days
does
not
also
lead
and
this
despite
the
profound
difference
in
the
fundamental
assumptions
of
the
two
theories
in
what
follows
we
shall
again
consider
these
important
deductions
and
we
shall
also
discuss
the
empirical
evidence
appertaining
to
them
which
has
hitherto
been
obtained
a
motion
of
the
perihelion
of
mercury
according
to
newtonian
mechanics
and
newtons
law
of
gravitation
a
planet
which
is
revolving
round
the
sun
would
describe
an
ellipse
round
the
latter
or
more
correctly
round
the
common
centre
of
gravity
of
the
sun
and
the
planet
in
such
a
system
the
sun
or
the
common
centre
of
gravity
lies
in
one
of
the
foci
of
the
orbital
ellipse
in
such
a
manner
that
in
the
course
of
a
planet
year
the
distance
sun
planet
grows
from
a
minimum
to
a
maximum
and
then
decreases
again
to
a
minimum
if
instead
of
newtons
law
we
insert
a
somewhat
different
law
of
attraction
into
the
calculation
we
find
that
according
to
this
new
law
the
motion
would
still
take
place
in
such
a
manner
that
the
distance
sun
planet
exhibits
periodic
variations

in
this
case

angle

by
the
line
joining

a
period

proximity

not
then

one

in
the
course
of
time
it
would
fill
up
an
annular
part
of
the
orbital
plane
viz
between
the
circle
of
least
and
the
circle
of
greatest
distance
of
the

according
also
to
the
general

differs

course
from
the
theory
of
newton
a
small
variation
from
the

our
result
may
also
be
stated
as

according
to
the
general
theory
of

the
major
axis
of
the
ellipse
rotates
round
the
sun
in
the
same
sense
as
the
orbital
motion
of
the

theory
requires
that
this
rotation
should
amount
to
seconds
of
arc
per
century
for
the
planet
mercury
but
for
the
other
planets
of
our
solar
system
its
magnitude
should
be
so
small
that
it
would
necessarily
escape

point
of
fact
astronomers
have
found
that
the
theory
of
newton
does
not
suffice
to
calculate
the

motion
of

with
an
exactness
corresponding
to
that
of
the
delicacy

observation
attainable
at
the
present
time
after
taking
account
of
all
the
disturbing
influences
exerted
on

by

it

that
an

deflection
of

by
a
gravitational
field
in
section
it
has
been
already
mentioned
that
according
to
the
general
theory
of
relativity
a
ray
of
light
will
experience
a
curvature
of
its
path
when
passing
through
a
gravitational
field
this
curvature
being
similar
to
that
experienced
by
the
path
of
a
body
which
is
projected
through
a
gravitational
field
as
a
result
of
this
theory
we
should
expect
that
a
ray
of
light
which
is
passing
close
to
a
heavenly
body
would
be
deviated
towards
the
latter
for
a
ray
of
light
which
passes
the
sun
at
a
distance
of
d
sun
radii
from
its
centre
the
angle
of

a
should
amount
to
eq

it
may
be
added
that
according
to
the
theory
half
of
figure
this
deflection
is
produced
by
the
newtonian
field
of
attraction
of
the
sun
and
the
other
half
by
the
geometrical
modification
curvature
of
space
caused
by
the
sun
this
result
admits
of
an
experimental
test
by
means
of
the
photographic
registration
of
stars
during
a
total
eclipse
of
the
sun
the
only
reason
why
we
must
wait
for
a
total
eclipse
is
because
at
every
other
time
the
atmosphere
is
so
strongly
illuminated
by
the
light
from
the
sun
that
the
stars
situated
near
the
suns
disc
are
invisible
the
predicted
effect
can
be
seen
clearly
from
the
accompanying

if
the

not
present
a
star
which
is
practically
infinitely
distant
would
be
seen
in

as

the
earth
but
as
a
consequence
of
the
deflection
of
light
from
the
star
by
the
sun
the
star
will
be
seen
in
the
direction

at
a
somewhat
greater
distance
from
the
centre
of
the
sun
than
corresponds
to
its
real
position
in
practice
the
question
is
tested
in
the
following
way
the
stars
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the

a

has
a

this

may
also
be

if
we
represent
the

in

to
transport
it
from

position

on

then
we
have

from

in

we
see
from

that
two
clocks
of
identical
construction
will
go
at
different
rates
when
situated
at
different
distances
from
the
centre
of
the
disc
this
result
is
aiso
valid
from
the
standpoint
of
an
observer
who
is
rotating
with
the
disc
now
as
judged
from
the
disc
the
latter
is
in
a
gravititional
field
of
potential
f
hence
the
result
we
have
obtained
will
hold
quite
generally
for
gravitational
fields
furthermore
we
can
regard
an
atom
which
is
emitting
spectral
lines
as
a
clock
so
that
the
following
statement
will
hold
an
atom
absorbs
or
emits
light
of
a
frequency
which
is
dependent
on
the
potential
of
the
gravitational
field
in
which
it
is
situated
the
frequency
of
an
atom
situated
on
the
surface
of
a
heavenly
body
will
be
somewhat
less
than
the
frequency
of
an
atom
of
the
same
element
which
is
situated
in
free
space
or
on
the
surface
of
a
smaller
celestial
body
now
f
k
m
r
where
k
is
newtons
constant
of
gravitation
and
m
is
the
mass
of
the
heavenly
body
thus
a
displacement
towards
the
red
ought
to
take
place
for
spectral
lines
produced
at
the
surface
of
stars
as
compared
with
the
spectral
lines
of
the
same
element
produced
at
the
surface
of
the
earth
the
amount
of
this
displacement
being
eq
file
eq
gif
for
the
sun
the
displacement
towards
the
red
predicted
by
theory
amounts
to
about
two
millionths
of
the
wave
length
a
trustworthy
calculation
is
not
possible
in
the
case
of
the
stars
because
in
general
neither
the
mass
m
nor
the
radius
r
are
known
it
is
an
open
question
whether
or
not
this
effect
exists
and
at
the
present
time
astronomers
are
working
with
great
zeal
towards
the
solution
owing
to
the
smallness
of
the
effect
in
the
case
of
the
sun
it
is
difficult
to
form
an
opinion
as
to
its
existence
whereas
grebe
and
bachem
bonn
as
a
result
of
their
own
measurements
and
those
of
evershed
and
schwarzschild
on
the
cyanogen
bands
have
placed
the
existence
of
the
effect
almost
beyond
doubt
while
other
investigators
particularly
st
john
have
been
led
to
the
opposite
opinion
in
consequence
of
their
measurements
mean
displacements
of
lines
towards
the
less
refrangible
end
of
the
spectrum
are
certainly
revealed
by
statistical
investigations
of
the
fixed
stars
but
up
to
the
present
the
examination
of
the
available
data
does
not
allow
of
any
definite
decision
being
arrived
at
as
to
whether
or
not
these
displacements
are
to
be
referred
in
reality
to
the
effect
of
gravitation
the
results
of
observation
have
been
collected
together
and
discussed
in
detail
from
the
standpoint
of
the
question
which
has
been
engaging
our
attention

in

at

a

will
be
reached
during
the
next
few
years
if
the
displacement
of
spectral
lines
towards
the
red
by
the
gravitational
potential
does
not
exist
then
the
general
theory
of
relativity
will
be
untenable
on
the
other
hand
if
the
cause
of
the
displacement
of
spectral
lines
be
definitely
traced
to
the
gravitational

then
the
study
of
this
displacement
will
furnish
us
with
important
information
as
to
the
mass
of
the
heavenly
bodies
a
notes
especially
since
the
next
planet
venus
has
an
orbit
that
is
almost
an
exact
circle
which
makes
it
more
difficult
to
locate

with
precision
the
displacentent
of
spectral
lines
towards

of

was
definitely
established
by

according

the
general
theory
of

supplementary
to
section
since
the
publication
of
the
first
edition
of
this
little
book
our
knowledge
about
the
structure
of
space
in
the
large
cosmological
problem
has
had
an
important
development
which
ought
to
be
mentioned
even
in
a
popular
presentation
of
the
subject
my
original
considerations
on
the
subject
were
based
on
two
hypotheses
there
exists
an
average
density
of
matter
in
the
whole
of
space
which
is
everywhere
the
same
and
different
from
zero
the
magnitude
radius
of
space
is
independent
of
time
both
these
hypotheses
proved
to
be
consistent
according
to
the
general
theory
of
relativity
but
only
after
a
hypothetical
term
was
added
to
the
field
equations
a
term
which
was
not
required
by
the
theory
as
such
nor
did
it
seem
natural
from
a
theoretical
point
of
view
cosmological
term
of
the
field
equations
hypothesis
appeared
unavoidable
to
me
at
the
time
since
i
thought
that
one
would
get
into
bottomless
speculations
if
one
departed
from
it
however
already
in
the
twenties
the
russian
mathematician
friedman
showed
that
a
different
hypothesis
was
natural
from
a
purely
theoretical
point
of
view
he
realized
that
it
was
possible
to
preserve
hypothesis
without
introducing
the
less
natural
cosmological
term
into
the
field
equations
of
gravitation
if
one
was
ready
to
drop
hypothesis
namely
the
original
field
equations
admit
a
solution
in
which
the
world
radius
depends
on
time
expanding
space
in
that
sense
one
can
say
according
to
friedman
that
the
theory
demands
an
expansion
of
space
a
few
years
later
hubble
showed
by
a
special
investigation
of
the
extra
galactic
nebulae
milky
ways
that
the
spectral
lines
emitted
showed
a
red
shift
which
increased
regularly
with
the
distance
of
the
nebulae
this
can
be
interpreted
in
regard
to
our
present
knowledge
only
in
the
sense
of
dopplers
principle
as
an
expansive
motion
of
the
system
of
stars
in
the
large
as
required
according
to
friedman
by
the
field
equations
of
gravitation
hubbles
discovery
can
therefore
be
considered
to
some
extent
as
a
confirmation
of
the
theory
there
does
arise
however
a
strange
difficulty
the
interpretation
of
the
galactic
line
shift
discovered
by
hubble
as
an
expansion
which
can
hardly
be
doubted
from
a
theoretical
point
of
view
leads
to
an
origin
of
this
expansion
which
lies
only
about
years
ago
while
physical
astronomy
makes
it
appear
likely
that
the
development
of
individual
stars
and
systems
of
stars
takes
considerably
longer
it
is
in
no
way
known
how
this
incongruity
is
to
be
overcome
i
further
want
to
rernark
that
the
theory
of
expanding
space
together
with
the
empirical
data
of
astronomy
permit
no
decision
to
be
reached
about
the
finite
or
infinite
character
of
three

space

the

of
