preface
to
those
leaning
on
the
sustaining
infinite
is
big
with
blessings
the
wakeful
shepherd
beholds
the
first
faint
morning
beams
ere
cometh
the
full
radiance
of
a
risen
day
so
shone
the
pale
star
to
the
shepherds
yet
it
traversed
the
night
and
came
where
in
cradled
obscurity
lay
the
bethlehem
babe
the
human
herald
of
christ
truth
who
would
make
plain
to
nighted
understanding
the
way
of
salvation
through
christ
jesus
till
across
a
night
of
error
should
dawn
the
ing
beams
and
shine
the
guiding
star
of
being
the
men
were
led
to
behold
and
to
follow
this
daystar
of
divine
science
lighting
the
way
to
eternal
harmony
the
time
for
thinkers
has
come
truth
independent
of
doctrines
and
systems
knocks
at
the
portal
of
humanity
contentment
with
the
past
and
the
cold
conventionality
of
materialism
are
crumbling
away
ignorance
of
god
is
no
longer
the
stone
to
faith
the
only
guarantee
of
obedience
is
a
right
apprehension
of
him
whom
to
know
aright
is
life
eternal
though
empires
fall
the
lord
shall
reign
forever
a
book
introduces
new
thoughts
but
it
can
not
make
them
speedily
understood
it
is
the
task
of
the
sturdy
pioneer
to
hew
the
tall
oak
and
to
cut
the
rough
granite
future
ages
must
declare
what
the
pioneer
has
accomplished
since
the
author
discovery
of
the
might
of
truth
in
the
treatment
of
disease
as
well
as
of
sin
her
system
has
been
fully
tested
and
has
not
been
found
wanting
but
to
reach
the
heights
of
christian
science
man
must
live
in
obedience
to
its
divine
principle
to
develop
the
full
might
of
this
science
the
discords
of
corporeal
sense
must
yield
to
the
harmony
of
spiritual
sense
even
as
the
science
of
music
corrects
false
tones
and
gives
sweet
cord
to
sound
theology
and
physics
teach
that
both
spirit
and
matter
are
real
and
good
whereas
the
fact
is
that
spirit
is
good
and
real
and
matter
is
spirit
site
the
question
what
is
truth
is
answered
by
demonstration
by
healing
both
disease
and
sin
and
this
demonstration
shows
that
christian
healing
fers
the
most
health
and
makes
the
best
men
on
this
basis
christian
science
will
have
a
fair
fight
sickness
has
been
combated
for
centuries
by
doctors
using
terial
remedies
but
the
question
arises
is
there
less
sickness
because
of
these
practitioners
a
vigorous
no
is
the
response
deducible
from
two
connate
facts
the
reputed
longevity
of
the
antediluvians
and
the
rapid
multiplication
and
increased
violence
of
diseases
since
the
flood
in
the
author
work
retrospection
and
tion
may
be
found
a
biographical
sketch
narrating
experiences
which
led
her
in
the
year
to
the
covery
of
the
system
that
she
denominated
christian
science
as
early
as
she
began
to
write
down
and
give
to
friends
the
results
of
her
scriptural
study
for
the
bible
was
her
sole
teacher
but
these
compositions
were
crude
the
first
steps
of
a
child
in
the
newly
covered
world
of
spirit
she
also
began
to
jot
down
her
thoughts
on
the
main
subject
but
these
jottings
were
only
infantile
lispings
of
truth
a
child
drinks
in
the
outward
world
through
the
eyes
and
rejoices
in
the
draught
he
is
as
sure
of
the
world
existence
as
he
is
of
his
own
yet
he
can
not
describe
the
world
he
finds
a
few
words
and
with
these
he
stammeringly
attempts
to
convey
his
feeling
later
the
tongue
voices
the
more
definite
thought
though
still
imperfectly
so
was
it
with
the
author
as
a
certain
poet
says
of
himself
she
lisped
in
numbers
for
the
numbers
came
certain
essays
written
at
that
early
date
are
still
in
circulation
among
her
first
pupils
but
they
are
feeble
attempts
to
state
the
principle
and
practice
of
christian
healing
and
are
not
complete
nor
tory
expositions
of
truth
though
rejoicing
in
some
progress
she
still
finds
herself
a
willing
ciple
at
the
heavenly
gate
waiting
for
the
mind
of
christ
her
first
pamphlet
on
christian
science
was
righted
in
but
it
did
not
appear
in
print
until
as
she
had
learned
that
this
science
must
be
as
she
had
learned
that
this
science
must
be
demonstrated
by
healing
before
a
work
on
the
subject
could
be
profitably
studied
from
until
copies
were
however
in
friendly
circulation
before
writing
this
work
science
and
health
she
made
copious
notes
of
scriptural
exposition
which
have
never
been
published
this
was
during
the
years
and
these
efforts
show
her
comparative
ignorance
of
the
stupendous
up
to
that
time
and
the
degrees
by
which
she
came
at
length
to
its
solution
but
she
values
them
as
a
parent
may
treasure
the
memorials
of
a
child
growth
and
she
would
not
have
them
changed
the
first
edition
of
science
and
health
was
lished
in
various
books
on
mental
healing
have
since
been
issued
most
of
them
incorrect
in
theory
and
filled
with
plagiarisms
from
science
and
health
they
regard
the
human
mind
as
a
healing
agent
whereas
this
mind
is
not
a
factor
in
the
principle
of
christian
science
a
few
books
however
which
are
based
on
this
book
are
useful
the
author
has
not
compromised
conscience
to
suit
the
general
drift
of
thought
but
has
bluntly
and
estly
given
the
text
of
truth
she
has
made
no
effort
to
embellish
elaborate
or
treat
in
full
detail
so
finite
a
theme
by
thousands
of
cases
of
healing
she
and
her
students
have
proved
the
worth
of
her
teachings
these
cases
for
the
most
part
have
been
abandoned
as
hopeless
by
regular
medical
attendants
few
invalids
will
turn
to
god
till
all
physical
supports
have
failed
because
there
is
so
little
faith
in
his
disposition
and
power
to
heal
disease
the
divine
principle
of
healing
is
proved
in
the
personal
experience
of
any
sincere
seeker
of
truth
its
purpose
is
good
and
its
practice
is
safer
and
more
tent
than
that
of
any
other
sanitary
method
the
biased
christian
thought
is
soonest
touched
by
truth
and
convinced
of
it
only
those
quarrel
with
her
method
who
do
not
understand
her
meaning
or
cerning
the
truth
come
not
to
the
light
lest
their
works
be
reproved
no
intellectual
proficiency
is
uisite
in
the
learner
but
sound
morals
are
most
sirable
many
imagine
that
the
phenomena
of
physical
ing
in
christian
science
present
only
a
phase
of
the
action
of
the
human
mind
which
action
in
some
plained
way
results
in
the
cure
of
disease
on
the
trary
christian
science
rationally
explains
that
all
other
pathological
methods
are
the
fruits
of
human
faith
in
matter
faith
in
the
workings
not
of
spirit
but
of
the
fleshly
mind
which
must
yield
to
science
the
physical
healing
of
christian
science
results
now
as
in
jesus
time
from
the
operation
of
divine
principle
before
which
sin
and
disease
lose
their
ity
in
human
consciousness
and
disappear
as
naturally
and
as
necessarily
as
darkness
gives
place
to
light
and
sin
to
reformation
now
as
then
these
mighty
works
are
not
supernatural
but
supremely
natural
they
are
the
sign
of
immanuel
or
god
with
us
a
divine
influence
ever
present
in
human
consciousness
and
peating
itself
coming
now
as
was
promised
aforetime
to
preach
deliverance
to
the
captives
of
sense
and
recovering
of
sight
to
the
blind
to
set
at
liberty
them
that
are
bruised
when
god
called
the
author
to
proclaim
his
gospel
to
this
age
there
came
also
the
charge
to
plant
and
water
his
vineyard
the
first
school
of
christian
science
was
started
by
the
author
with
only
one
student
in
lynn
massachusetts
about
the
year
in
she
opened
the
massachusetts
metaphysical
college
in
boston
under
the
seal
of
the
commonwealth
a
law
relative
to
colleges
having
been
passed
which
enabled
her
to
get
this
institution
chartered
for
medical
poses
no
charters
were
granted
to
christian
tists
for
such
institutions
after
and
up
to
that
date
hers
was
the
only
college
of
this
character
which
had
been
established
in
the
united
states
where
christian
science
was
first
introduced
during
seven
years
over
four
thousand
students
were
taught
by
the
author
in
this
college
meanwhile
she
was
pastor
of
the
first
established
church
of
christ
scientist
president
of
the
first
christian
entist
association
convening
monthly
publisher
of
her
own
works
and
for
a
portion
of
this
time
sole
editor
and
publisher
of
the
christian
science
journal
the
first
periodical
issued
by
christian
scientists
she
closed
her
college
october
in
the
height
of
its
prosperity
with
a
conviction
that
the
next
two
years
of
her
life
should
be
given
to
the
aration
of
the
revision
of
science
and
health
which
was
published
in
she
retained
her
charter
and
as
its
president
reopened
the
college
in
as
iary
to
her
church
until
june
she
had
never
read
this
book
throughout
consecutively
in
order
to
cidate
her
idealism
in
the
spirit
of
christ
charity
as
one
who
hopeth
all
things
endureth
all
things
and
is
joyful
to
bear
consolation
to
the
sorrowing
and
healing
to
the
sick
she
commits
these
pages
to
honest
seekers

truth

your

things
ye
have

of
before
ye
ask
him
christ
jesus
the
prayer
that
reforms
the
sinner
and
heals
the
sick
is
an
absolute
faith
that
all
things
are
possible
to
god
a
spiritual
understanding
of
him
an
unselfed
love
regardless
of
what
another
may

combined
with
molation
are
god
gracious
means
for
accomplishing
whatever
has
been
successfully
done
for
the
ization
and
health
of
mankind
thoughts
unspoken
are
not
unknown
to
the
divine
mind
desire
is
prayer
and
no
loss
can
occur
from
trusting
god
with
our
desires
that
they
may
be
moulded
and
exalted
before
they
take
form
in
words
and
in
deeds
right
motives
what
are
the
motives
for
prayer
do
we
pray
to
make
ourselves
better
or
to
benefit
those
who
hear
us
to
enlighten
the
infinite
or
to
be
heard
of
men
are
we
benefited
by
praying
yes
the
desire
which
goes
forth
hungering
after
ness
is
blessed
of
our
father
and
it
does
not
return
unto
us
void
deity
unchangeable
god
is
not
moved
by
the
breath
of
praise
to
do
more
than
he
has
already
done
nor
can
the
infinite
do
less
than
bestow
all
good
since
he
is
ing
wisdom
and
love
we
can
do
more
for
ourselves
by
humble
fervent
petitions
but
the
ing
does
not
grant
them
simply
on
the
ground
of
service
for
he
already
knows
all
prayer
can
not
change
the
science
of
being
but
it
tends
to
bring
us
into
harmony
with
it
goodness
tains
the
demonstration
of
truth
a
request
that
god
will
save
us
is
not
all
that
is
required
the
mere
habit
of
pleading
with
the
divine
mind
as
one
pleads
with
a
human
being
perpetuates
the
belief
in
god
as
humanly
circumscribed
an
error
which
impedes
ual
growth
god
standard
god
is
love
can
we
ask
him
to
be
more
god
is
intelligence
can
we
inform
the
infinite
mind
of
thing
he
does
not
already
comprehend
do
we
expect
to
change
perfection
shall
we
plead
for
more
at
the
open
fount
which
is
ing
forth
more
than
we
accept
the
unspoken
desire
does
bring
us
nearer
the
source
of
all
existence
and
blessedness
asking
god
to
god
is
a
vain
repetition
god
is
the
same
yesterday
and
and
forever
and
he
who
is
immutably
right
will
do
right
without
being
reminded
of
his
province
the
wisdom
of
man
is
not
sufficient
to
warrant
him
in
advising
god
the
spiritual
mathematics
who
would
stand
before
a
blackboard
and
pray
the
principle
of
mathematics
to
solve
the
problem
the
rule
is
already
established
and
it
is
our
task
to
work
out
the
solution
shall
we
ask
the
divine
principle
of
all
goodness
to
do
his
own
work
his
work
is
done
and
we
have
only
to
avail
ourselves
of
god
rule
in
order
to
receive
his
ing
which
enables
us
to
work
out
our
own
salvation
the
divine
being
must
be
reflected
by
man
else
man
is
not
the
image
and
likeness
of
the
patient
tender
and
true
the
one
altogether
lovely
but
to
understand
god
is
the
work
of
eternity
and
demands
absolute
consecration
of
thought
energy
and
desire
prayerful
ingratitude
how
empty
are
our
conceptions
of
deity
we
admit
theoretically
that
god
is
good
omnipotent
present
infinite
and
then
we
try
to
give
information
to
this
infinite
mind
we
plead
for
unmerited
pardon
and
for
a
liberal
outpouring
of
benefactions
are
we
really
grateful
for
the
good
already
received
then
we
shall
avail
ourselves
of
the
blessings
we
have
and
thus
be
fitted
to
receive
more
gratitude
is
much
more
than
a
verbal
expression
of
thanks
action
expresses
more
gratitude
than
speech
if
we
are
ungrateful
for
life
truth
and
love
and
yet
return
thanks
to
god
for
all
blessings
we
are
sincere
and
incur
the
sharp
censure
our
master
nounces
on
hypocrites
in
such
a
case
the
only
acceptable
prayer
is
to
put
the
finger
on
the
lips
and
remember
our
blessings
while
the
heart
is
far
from
divine
truth
and
love
we
can
not
conceal
the
tude
of
barren
lives
efficacious
petitions
what
we
most
need
is
the
prayer
of
fervent
desire
for
growth
in
grace
expressed
in
patience
meekness
love
and
good
deeds
to
keep
the
mandments
of
our
master
and
follow
his
example
is
our
proper
debt
to
him
and
the
only
worthy
evidence
of
our
gratitude
for
all
that
he
has
done
outward
worship
is
not
of
itself
sufficient
to
express
loyal
and
heartfelt
gratitude
since
he
has
said
if
ye
love
me
keep
my
commandments
the
habitual
struggle
to
be
always
good
is
ing
prayer
its
motives
are
made
manifest
in
the
blessings
they
bring
blessings
which
even
if
not
acknowledged
in
audible
words
attest
our
worthiness
to
be
partakers
of
love
watchfulness
requisite
simply
asking
that
we
may
love
god
will
never
make
us
love
him
but
the
longing
to
be
better
and
holier
expressed
in
daily
ness
and
in
striving
to
assimilate
more
of
the
divine
character
will
mould
and
fashion
us
anew
until
we
awake
in
his
likeness
we
reach
the
science
of
christianity
through
demonstration
of
the
divine
nature
but
in
this
wicked
world
goodness
will
be
evil
spoken
of
and
patience
must
bring
experience
veritable
devotion
audible
prayer
can
never
do
the
works
of
spiritual
understanding
which
regenerates
but
silent
prayer
watchfulness
and
devout
obedience
enable
us
to
follow
jesus
example
long
prayers
superstition
and
creeds
clip
the
strong
pinions
of
love
and
clothe
religion
in
human
forms
whatever
rializes
worship
hinders
man
spiritual
growth
and
keeps
him
from
demonstrating
his
power
over
error
sorrow
and
reformation
sorrow
for
is
but
one
step
towards
reform
and
the
very
easiest
step
the
next
and
great
step
quired
by
wisdom
is
the
test
of
our
sincerity
namely
reformation
to
this
end
we
are
placed
under
the
stress
of
circumstances
temptation
bids
us
repeat
the
offence
and
woe
comes
in
return
for
what
is
done
so
it
will
ever
be
till
we
learn
that
there
is
no
discount
in
the
law
of
justice
and
that
we
must
pay
the
uttermost
farthing
the
measure
ye
mete
shall
be
measured
to
you
again
and
it
will
be
full
and
ning
over
saints
and
sinners
get
their
full
award
but
not
always
in
this
world
the
followers
of
christ
drank
his
cup
ingratitude
and
persecution
filled
it
to
the
brim
but
god
pours
the
riches
of
his
love
into
the
understanding
and
affections
giving
us
strength
according
to
our
day
ners
flourish
like
a
green
bay
tree
but
looking
farther
the
psalmist
could
see
their
end
the
destruction
of
sin
through
suffering
cancellation
of
human
sin
prayer
is
not
to
be
used
as
a
confessional
to
cancel
sin
such
an
error
would
impede
true
religion
sin
is
forgiven
only
as
it
is
destroyed
by
christ
truth
and
life
if
prayer
nourishes
the
belief
that
sin
is
cancelled
and
that
man
is
made
better
merely
by
praying
prayer
is
an
evil
he
grows
worse
who
continues
in
sin
because
he
fancies
himself
forgiven
diabolism
destroyed
an
apostle
says
that
the
son
of
god
christ
came
to
destroy
the
of
the
devil
we
should
follow
our
divine
exemplar
and
seek
the
struction
of
all
evil
works
error
and
disease
included
we
can
not
escape
the
penalty
due
for
sin
the
tures
say
that
if
we
deny
christ
he
also
will
deny
us
pardon
and
amendment
divine
love
corrects
and
governs
man
men
may
pardon
but
this
divine
principle
alone
reforms
the
sinner
god
is
not
separate
from
the
dom
he
bestows
the
talents
he
gives
we
must
improve
calling
on
him
to
forgive
our
work
badly
done
or
left
undone
implies
the
vain
supposition
that
we
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
ask
pardon
and
that
afterwards
we
shall
be
free
to
repeat
the
offence
to
cause
suffering
as
the
result
of
sin
is
the
means
of
destroying
sin
every
supposed
pleasure
in
sin
will
furnish
more
than
its
equivalent
of
pain
until
lief
in
material
life
and
sin
is
destroyed
to
reach
heaven
the
harmony
of
being
we
must
understand
the
divine
principle
of
being
mercy
without
partiality
god
is
love
more
than
this
we
can
not
ask
higher
we
can
not
look
farther
we
can
not
go
to
suppose
that
god
forgives
or
punishes
sin
according
as
his
mercy
is
sought
or
sought
is
to
misunderstand
love
and
to
make
prayer
the
for
divine
severity
jesus
uncovered
and
rebuked
sin
before
he
cast
it
out
of
a
sick
woman
he
said
that
satan
had
bound
her
and
to
peter
he
said
thou
art
an
fence
unto
me
he
came
teaching
and
showing
men
how
to
destroy
sin
sickness
and
death
he
said
of
the
fruitless
tree
it
is
hewn
down
it
is
believed
by
many
that
a
certain
magistrate
who
lived
in
the
time
of
jesus
left
this
record
his
rebuke
is
fearful
the
strong
language
of
our
ter
confirms
this
description
the
only
civil
sentence
which
he
had
for
error
was
get
thee
behind
me
satan
still
stronger
evidence
that
jesus
reproof
was
pointed
and
pungent
is
found
in
his
own
words
showing
the
necessity
for
such
forcible
utterance
when
he
cast
out
devils
and
healed
the
sick
and
sinning
the
relinquishment
of
error
prives
material
sense
of
its
false
claims
audible
praying
audible
prayer
is
impressive
it
gives
momentary
solemnity
and
elevation
to
thought
but
does
it
duce
any
lasting
benefit
looking
deeply
into
these
things
we
find
that
a
zeal
not
according
to
knowledge
gives
occasion
for
tion
unfavorable
to
spiritual
growth
sober
resolve
and
wholesome
perception
of
god
requirements
the
tives
for
verbal
prayer
may
embrace
too
much
love
of
applause
to
induce
or
encourage
christian
sentiment
emotional
utterances
physical
sensation
not
soul
produces
material
stasy
and
emotion
if
spiritual
sense
always
guided
men
there
would
grow
out
of
ecstatic
ments
a
higher
experience
and
a
better
life
with
more
devout
and
purity
a
satisfied
ventilation
of
fervent
sentiments
never
makes
a
christian
god
is
not
influenced
by
man
the
vine
ear
is
not
an
auditory
nerve
it
is
the
and
mind
to
whom
each
need
of
man
is
always
known
and
by
whom
it
will
be
supplied
danger
from
audible
prayer
the
danger
from
prayer
is
that
it
may
lead
us
into
tation
by
it
we
may
become
involuntary
hypocrites
tering
desires
which
are
not
real
and
consoling
ourselves
in
the
midst
of
sin
with
the
recollection
that
we
have
prayed
over
it
or
mean
to
ask
giveness
at
some
later
day
hypocrisy
is
fatal
to
religion
a
wordy
prayer
may
afford
a
quiet
sense
of
justification
though
it
makes
the
sinner
a
hypocrite
we
never
need
to
despair
of
an
honest
heart
but
there
is
little
hope
for
those
who
come
only
cally
face
to
face
with
their
wickedness
and
then
seek
to
hide
it
their
prayers
are
indexes
which
do
not
correspond
with
their
character
they
hold
secret
fellowship
with
sin
and
such
externals
are
spoken
of
by
jesus
as
like
unto
whited
sepulchres
full
of
all
uncleanness
aspiration
and
love
if
a
man
though
apparently
fervent
and
prayerful
is
impure
and
therefore
insincere
what
must
be
the
comment
upon
him
if
he
reached
the
loftiness
of
his
prayer
there
would
be
no
occasion
for
comment
if
we
feel
the
aspiration
mility
gratitude
and
love
which
our
words
express
this
god
accepts
and
it
is
wise
not
to
try
to
deceive
ourselves
or
others
for
there
is
nothing
covered
that
shall
not
be
revealed
professions
and
audible
ers
are
like
charity
in
one
respect
they
cover
the
multitude
of
sins
praying
for
humility
with
ever
fervency
of
expression
does
not
always
mean
a
desire
for
it
if
we
turn
away
from
the
poor
we
are
not
ready
to
receive
the
reward
of
him
who
blesses
the
poor
we
confess
to
having
a
very
wicked
heart
and
ask
that
it
may
be
laid
bare
before
us
but
do
we
not
already
know
more
of
this
heart
than
we
are
willing
to
have
our
neighbor
see
searching
the
heart
we
should
examine
ourselves
and
learn
what
is
the
affection
and
purpose
of
the
heart
for
in
this
way
only
can
we
learn
what
we
honestly
are
if
a
friend
informs
us
of
a
fault
do
we
listen
tiently
to
the
rebuke
and
credit
what
is
said
do
we
not
rather
give
thanks
that
we
are
not
as
other
men
during
many
years
the
author
has
been
most
grateful
for
merited
rebuke
the
wrong
lies
in
unmerited
sure
in
the
falsehood
which
does
no
one
any
good
summit
of
aspiration
the
test
of
all
prayer
lies
in
the
answer
to
these
questions
do
we
love
our
neighbor
better
because
of
this
asking
do
we
pursue
the
old
ness
satisfied
with
having
prayed
for
thing
better
though
we
give
no
evidence
of
the
cerity
of
our
requests
by
living
consistently
with
our
prayer
if
selfishness
has
given
place
to
kindness
we
shall
regard
our
neighbor
unselfishly
and
bless
them
that
curse
us
but
we
shall
never
meet
this
great
duty
simply
by
asking
that
it
may
be
done
there
is
a
cross
to
be
taken
up
before
we
can
enjoy
the
fruition
of
our
hope
and
faith
practical
religion
dost
thou
love
the
lord
thy
god
with
all
thy
heart
and
with
all
thy
soul
and
with
all
thy
mind
this
command
includes
much
even
the
render
of
all
merely
material
sensation
tion
and
worship
this
is
the
el
dorado
of
christianity
it
involves
the
science
of
life
and
recognizes
only
the
divine
control
of
spirit
in
which
soul
is
our
master
and
material
sense
and
human
will
have
no
place
the
chalice
sacrificial
are
you
willing
to
leave
all
for
christ
for
truth
and
so
be
counted
among
sinners
no
do
you
really
desire
to
attain
this
point
no
then
why
make
long
prayers
about
it
and
ask
to
be
christians
since
you
do
not
care
to
tread
in
the
footsteps
of
our
dear
master
if
unwilling
to
follow
his
example
why
pray
with
the
lips
that
you
may
be
partakers
of
his
nature
consistent
prayer
is
the
desire
to
do
right
prayer
means
that
we
desire
to
walk
and
will
walk
in
the
light
so
far
as
we
receive
it
even
though
with
ing
footsteps
and
that
waiting
patiently
on
the
lord
we
will
leave
our
real
desires
to
be
rewarded
by
him
the
world
must
grow
to
the
spiritual
understanding
of
prayer
if
good
enough
to
profit
by
jesus
cup
of
earthly
sorrows
god
will
sustain
us
under
these
rows
until
we
are
thus
divinely
qualified
and
are
willing
to
drink
his
cup
millions
of
vain
repetitions
will
never
pour
into
prayer
the
unction
of
spirit
in
demonstration
of
power
and
with
signs
following
christian
science
reveals
a
necessity
for
overcoming
the
world
the
flesh
and
evil
and
thus
destroying
all
error
seeking
is
not
sufficient
it
is
striving
that
enables
us
to
enter
spiritual
attainments
open
the
door
to
a
higher
understanding
of
the
divine
life
perfunctory
prayers
one
of
the
forms
of
worship
in
thibet
is
to
carry
a
through
the
streets
and
stop
at
the
doors
to
earn
a
penny
by
grinding
out
a
prayer
but
the
advance
guard
of
progress
has
paid
for
the
privilege
of
prayer
the
price
of
persecution
asking
amiss
experience
teaches
us
that
we
do
not
always
receive
the
blessings
we
ask
for
in
prayer
there
is
some
apprehension
of
the
source
and
means
of
all
goodness
and
blessedness
or
we
should
certainly
receive
that
for
which
we
ask
the
tures
say
ye
ask
and
receive
not
because
ye
ask
amiss
that
ye
may
consume
it
upon
your
lusts
that
which
we
desire
and
for
which
we
ask
it
is
not
always
best
for
us
to
receive
in
this
case
infinite
love
will
not
grant
the
request
do
you
ask
wisdom
to
be
ciful
and
not
to
punish
sin
then
ye
ask
amiss
without
punishment
sin
would
multiply
jesus

specified
also
the
terms
of
forgiveness
when
forgiving
the
adulterous

no
more
remission
of
penalty
a
magistrate
sometimes
remits
the
penalty
but
this
may
be
no
moral
benefit
to
the
criminal
and
at
best
it
only
saves
the
criminal
from
one
form
of
punishment
the
moral
law
which
has
the
right
to
acquit
or
condemn
always
demands
tion

mortals
can
go
up
higher
broken
law
brings
penalty
in
order
to
compel
this
progress
truth
annihilates
error
mere
legal
pardon
and
there
is
no
other
for
divine
principle
never
pardons
our
sins
or
mistakes
till
they
are
corrected
leaves
the
offender
free
to
peat
the
offence
if
indeed
he
has
not
already
suffered
sufficiently
from
vice
to
make
him
turn
from
it
with
loathing
truth
bestows
no
pardon
upon
error
but
wipes
it
out
in
the
most
effectual
manner
jesus
suffered
for
our
sins
not
to
annul
the
divine
sentence
for
an
dividual
sin
but
because
sin
brings
inevitable
suffering
desire
for
holiness
petitions
bring
to
mortals
only
the
results
of
tals
own
faith
we
know
that
a
desire
for
holiness
is
requisite
in
order
to
gain
holiness
but
if
we
desire
holiness
above
all
else
we
shall
rifice
everything
for
it
we
must
be
willing
to
do
this
that
we
may
walk
securely
in
the
only
practical
road
to
holiness
prayer
can
not
change
the
unalterable
truth
nor
can
prayer
alone
give
us
an
understanding
of
truth
but
prayer
coupled
with
a
fervent
habitual
desire
to
know
and
do
the
will
of
god
will
bring
us
into
all
truth
such
a
desire
has
little
need
of
audible
expression
it
is
best
expressed
in
thought
and
in
life
prayer
for
the
sick
the
prayer
of
faith
shall
save
the
sick
says
the
scripture
what
is
this
healing
prayer
a
mere
quest
that
god
will
heal
the
sick
has
no
power
to
gain
more
of
the
divine
presence
than
is
always
at
hand
the
beneficial
effect
of
such
prayer
for
the
sick
is
on
the
human
mind
ing
it
act
more
powerfully
on
the
body
through
a
blind
faith
in
god
this
however
is
one
belief
casting
out
another
a
belief
in
the
unknown
casting
out
a
belief
in
sickness
it
is
neither
science
nor
truth
which
acts
through
blind
belief
nor
is
it
the
human
standing
of
the
divine
healing
principle
as
manifested
in
jesus
whose
humble
prayers
were
deep
and
scientious
protests
of
truth
of
man
likeness
to
god
and
of
man
unity
with
truth
and
love
prayer
to
a
corporeal
god
affects
the
sick
like
a
drug
which
has
no
efficacy
of
its
own
but
borrows
its
power
from
human
faith
and
belief
the
drug
does
nothing
because
it
has
no
intelligence
it
is
a
mortal
belief
not
divine
principle
or
love
which
causes
a
drug
to
be
apparently
either
poisonous
or
sanative
the
common
custom
of
praying
for
the
recovery
of
the
sick
finds
help
in
blind
belief
whereas
help
should
come
from
the
enlightened
understanding
changes
in
belief
may
go
on
indefinitely
but
they
are
the
merchandise
of
human
thought
and
not
the
outgrowth
of
divine
science
love
impartial
and
universal
does
deity
interpose
in
behalf
of
one
worshipper
and
not
help
another
who
offers
the
same
measure
of
prayer
if
the
sick
recover
because
they
pray
or
are
prayed
for
audibly
only
tioners
or
by
proxy
should
get
well
in
divine
science
where
prayers
are
mental
may
avail
selves
of
god
as
a
very
present
help
in
trouble
love
is
impartial
and
universal
in
its
adaptation
and
bestowals
it
is
the
open
fount
which
cries
ho
every
one
that
thirsteth
come
ye
to
the
waters
public
exaggerations
in
public
prayer
we
often
go
beyond
our
convictions
beyond
the
honest
standpoint
of
fervent
desire
if
we
are
not
secretly
yearning
and
openly
ing
for
the
accomplishment
of
all
we
ask
our
prayers
are
vain
repetitions
such
as
the
heathen
use
if
our
petitions
are
sincere
we
labor
for
what
we
ask
and
our
father
who
seeth
in
secret
will
reward
us
openly
can
the
mere
public
expression
of
our
sires
increase
them
do
we
gain
the
omnipotent
ear
sooner
by
words
than
by
thoughts
even
if
prayer
is
sincere
god
knows
our
need
before
we
tell
him
or
our
about
it
if
we
cherish
the
desire
estly
and
silently
and
humbly
god
will
bless
it
and
we
shall
incur
less
risk
of
overwhelming
our
real
wishes
with
a
torrent
of
words
corporeal
ignorance
if
we
pray
to
god
as
a
corporeal
person
this
will
prevent
us
from
relinquishing
the
human
doubts
and
fears
which
attend
such
a
belief
and
so
we
can
not
grasp
the
wonders
wrought
by
nite
incorporeal
love
to
whom
all
things
are
possible
because
of
human
ignorance
of
the
divine
principle
love
the
father
of
all
is
represented
as
a
corporeal
creator
hence
men
recognize
themselves
as
merely
physical
and
are
ignorant
of
man
as
god
image
or
flection
and
of
man
eternal
incorporeal
existence
the
world
of
error
is
ignorant
of
the
world
of
truth
blind
to
the
reality
of
man
existence
for
the
world
of
sation
is
not
cognizant
of
life
in
soul
not
in
body
bodily
presence
if
we
are
sensibly
with
the
body
and
regard
tence
as
a
corporeal
material
person
whose
ear
we
would
gain
we
are
not
absent
from
the
body
and
present
with
the
lord
in
the
demonstration
of
spirit
we
can
not
serve
two
ters
to
be
present
with
the
lord
is
to
have
not
mere
emotional
ecstasy
or
faith
but
the
actual
stration
and
understanding
of
life
as
revealed
in
christian
science
to
be
with
the
lord
is
to
be
in
obedience
to
the
law
of
god
to
be
absolutely
governed
by
divine
love
by
spirit
not
by
matter
spiritualized
consciousness
become
conscious
for
a
single
moment
that
life
and
intelligence
are
purely
spiritual
neither
in
nor
of
matter
and
the
body
will
then
utter
no
complaints
if
suffering
from
a
belief
in
sickness
you
will
find
yourself
suddenly
well
sorrow
is
turned
into
joy
when
the
body
is
controlled
by
itual
life
truth
and
love
hence
the
hope
of
the
promise
jesus
bestows
he
that
believeth
on
me
the
works
that
i
do
shall
he
do
also
because
i
go
unto
my
father
because
the
ego
is
absent
from
the
body
and
present
with
truth
and
love
the
lord
prayer
is
the
prayer
of
soul
not
of
material
sense
entirely
separate
from
the
belief
and
dream
of
rial
living
is
the
life
divine
revealing
spiritual
standing
and
the
consciousness
of
man
dominion
over
the
whole
earth
this
understanding
casts
out
error
and
heals
the
sick
and
with
it
you
can
speak
as
one
having
authority
when
thou
prayest
enter
into
thy
closet
and
when
thou
hast
shut
thy
door
pray
to
thy
father
which
is
in
secret
and
thy
father
which
seeth
in
secret
shall
reward
thee
openly
spiritual
sanctuary
so
spake
jesus
the
closet
typifies
the
sanctuary
of
spirit
the
door
of
which
shuts
out
sinful
sense
but
lets
in
truth
life
and
love
closed
to
error
it
is
open
to
truth
and
the
father
in
secret
is
unseen
to
the
physical
senses
but
he
knows
all
things
and
rewards
according
to
motives
not
according
to
speech
to
enter
into
the
heart
of
prayer
the
door
of
the
erring
senses
must
be
closed
lips
must
be
mute
and
materialism
silent
that
man
may
have
audience
with
spirit
the
divine
principle
love
which
destroys
all
error
effectual
invocation
in
order
to
pray
aright
we
must
enter
into
the
closet
and
shut
the
door
we
must
close
the
lips
and
silence
the
material
senses
in
the
quiet
sanctuary
of
earnest
longings
we
must
deny
sin
and
plead
god
allness
we
must
resolve
to
take
up
the
cross
and
go
forth
with
honest
hearts
to
work
and
watch
for
wisdom
truth
and
love
we
must
pray
without
ceasing
such
prayer
is
swered
in
so
far
as
we
put
our
desires
into
practice
the
master
injunction
is
that
we
pray
in
secret
and
let
our
lives
attest
our
sincerity
trustworthy
beneficence
christians
rejoice
in
secret
beauty
and
bounty
hidden
from
the
world
but
known
to
god
purity
and
affection
are
constant
prayers
practice
not
profession
understanding
not
belief
gain
the
ear
and
right
hand
of
omnipotence
and
they
assuredly
call
down
infinite
blessings
ness
is
the
foundation
of
enlightened
faith
without
a
fitness
for
holiness
we
can
not
receive
holiness
loftiest
adoration
a
great
sacrifice
of
material
things
must
precede
this
advanced
spiritual
understanding
the
highest
prayer
is
not
one
of
faith
merely
it
is
tion
such
prayer
heals
sickness
and
must
destroy
sin
and
death
it
distinguishes
between
truth
that
is
sinless
and
the
falsity
of
sinful
sense
the
prayer
of
jesus
christ
our
master
taught
his
disciples
one
brief
prayer
which
we
name
after
him
the
lord
prayer
our
ter
said
after
this
manner
therefore
pray
ye
and
then
he
gave
that
prayer
which
covers
all
human
needs
there
is
indeed
some
doubt
among
bible
scholars
whether
the
last
line
is
not
an
addition
to
the
prayer
by
a
later
copyist
but
this
does
not
affect
the
meaning
of
the
prayer
itself
in
the
phrase
deliver
us
from
evil
the
original
properly
reads
deliver
us
from
the
evil
one
this
reading
strengthens
our
scientific
apprehension
of
the
tion
for
christian
science
teaches
us
that
the
evil
one
or
one
evil
is
but
another
name
for
the
first
lie
and
all
liars
only
as
we
rise
above
all
material
sensuousness
and
sin
can
we
reach
the
aspiration
and
itual
consciousness
which
is
indicated
in
the
prayer
and
which
instantaneously
heals
the
sick
here
let
me
give
what
i
understand
to
be
the
itual
sense
of
the
lord
prayer
our
father
which
art
in
heaven
god
hallowed
be
thy
name
thy
kingdom
come
kingdom
is
come
thou
art
thy
will
be
done
in
earth
as
it
is
in
heaven
us
to
know
as
in
heaven
so
on
earth
god
is
omnipotent
give
us
this
day
our
daily
bread
us
grace
for
feed
the
famished
affections
and
forgive
us
our
debts
as
we
forgive
our
debtors
love
is
reflected
in
love
and
lead
us
not
into
temptation
but
deliver
us
from
evil
god
leadeth
us
not
into
temptation
but
delivereth
us
from
sin
disease
and
for
thine
is
the
kingdom
and
the
power
and
the
glory
forever
god
is
infinite

chapter

atonement
and
eucharist
and
they
that
are
christ
have
crucified
the
flesh
with
the
affections
and
lusts
paul
for
christ
sent
me
not
to
baptize
but
to
preach
the
gospel
paul
for
i
say
unto
you
i
will
not
drink
of
the
fruit
of
the
vine
until
the
kingdom
of
god
shall
come
jesus
divine
oneness
atonement
is
the
exemplification
of
man
unity
with
god
whereby
man
reflects
divine
truth
life
and
love
jesus
of
nazareth
taught
and
demonstrated
man
oneness
with
the
father
and
for
this
we
owe
him
endless
homage
his
mission
was
both
dividual
and
collective
he
did
life
work
aright
not
only
in
justice
to
himself
but
in
mercy
to
mortals
to
show
them
how
to
do
theirs
but
not
to
do
it
for
them
nor
to
relieve
them
of
a
single
responsibility
jesus
acted
boldly
against
the
accredited
evidence
of
the
senses
against
pharisaical
creeds
and
practices
and
he
refuted
all
opponents
with
his
healing
power
human
reconciliation
the
atonement
of
christ
reconciles
man
to
god
not
god
to
man
for
the
divine
principle
of
christ
is
god
and
how
can
god
propitiate
himself
christ
is
truth
which
reaches
no
higher
than
itself
the
fountain
can
rise
no
higher
than
its
source
christ
truth
could
conciliate
no
nature
above
his
own
derived
from
the
eternal
love
it
was
therefore
christ
purpose
to
reconcile
man
to
god
not
god
to
man
love
and
truth
are
not
at
war
with
god
image
and
likeness
man
can
not
exceed
divine
love
and
so
atone
for
self
even
christ
can
not
reconcile
truth
to
error
for
truth
and
error
are
irreconcilable
jesus
aided
in
ciling
man
to
god
by
giving
man
a
truer
sense
of
love
the
divine
principle
of
jesus
teachings
and
this
truer
sense
of
love
redeems
man
from
the
law
of
matter
sin
and
death
by
the
law
of
spirit
the
law
of
divine
love
the
master
forbore
not
to
speak
the
whole
truth
claring
precisely
what
would
destroy
sickness
sin
and
death
although
his
teaching
set
households
at
variance
and
brought
to
material
beliefs
not
peace
but
a
sword
efficacious
repentance
every
pang
of
repentance
and
suffering
every
effort
for
reform
every
good
thought
and
deed
will
help
us
to
understand
jesus
atonement
for
sin
and
aid
its
efficacy
but
if
the
sinner
continues
to
pray
and
repent
sin
and
be
sorry
he
has
little
part
in
the
ment
in
the
with
god
for
he
lacks
the
practical
repentance
which
reforms
the
heart
and
enables
man
to
do
the
will
of
wisdom
those
who
can
not
onstrate
at
least
in
part
the
divine
principle
of
the
ings
and
practice
of
our
master
have
no
part
in
god
if
living
in
disobedience
to
him
we
ought
to
feel
no
ity
although
god
is
good
jesus
sinless
career
jesus
urged
the
commandment
thou
shalt
have
no
other
gods
before
me
which
may
be
dered
thou
shalt
have
no
belief
of
life
as
mortal
thou
shalt
not
know
evil
for
there
is
one
life
even
god
good
he
rendered
unto
caesar
the
things
which
are
caesar
and
unto
god
the
things
that
are
god
he
at
last
paid
no
homage
to
forms
of
doctrine
or
to
theories
of
man
but
acted
and
spake
as
he
was
moved
not
by
spirits
but
by
spirit
to
the
ritualistic
priest
and
hypocritical
pharisee
jesus
said
the
publicans
and
the
harlots
go
into
the
kingdom
of
god
before
you
jesus
history
made
a
new
calendar
which
we
call
the
christian
era
but
he
established
no
ritualistic
worship
he
knew
that
men
can
be
baptized
partake
of
the
eucharist
support
the
clergy
observe
the
sabbath
make
long
prayers
and
yet
be
sensual
and
sinful
perfect
example
jesus
bore
our
infirmities
he
knew
the
error
of
mortal
belief
and
with
his
stripes
the
rejection
of
error
we
are
healed
despised
and
rejected
of
men
returning
blessing
for
cursing
he
taught
tals
the
opposite
of
themselves
even
the
nature
of
god
and
when
error
felt
the
power
of
truth
the
scourge
and
the
cross
awaited
the
great
teacher
yet
he
swerved
not
well
knowing
that
to
obey
the
divine
order
and
trust
god
saves
retracing
and
traversing
anew
the
path
from
sin
to
holiness
behest
of
the
cross
material
belief
is
slow
to
acknowledge
what
the
spiritual
fact
implies
the
truth
is
the
centre
of
all
religion
it
commands
sure
entrance
into
the
realm
of
love
paul
wrote
let
us
lay
aside
every
weight
and
the
sin
which
doth
so
easily
beset
us
and
let
us
run
with
patience
the
race
that
is
set
before
us
that
is
let
us
put
aside
material
self
and
sense
and
seek
the
divine
principle
and
science
of
all
healing
moral
victory
if
truth
is
overcoming
error
in
your
daily
walk
and
conversation
you
can
finally
say
i
have
fought
a
good
fight
i
have
kept
the
faith
cause
you
are
a
better
man
this
is
having
our
part

christians
do
not
continue
to
labor
and
pray
expecting
because
of
another

they
shall

by
pinning

to
another
vicarious
effort
whosoever
believeth
that
wrath
is
righteous
or
that
divinity
is
appeased
by
human
suffering
does
not
understand
god
justice
and
substitution
justice
requires
reformation
of
the
sinner
mercy
cancels
the
debt
only
when
justice
approves
revenge
is
inadmissible
wrath
which
is
only
appeased
is
not
destroyed
but
partially
indulged
wisdom
and
love
may
require
many
sacrifices
of
self
to
save
us
from
sin
one
sacrifice
however
great
is
insufficient
to
pay
the
debt
of
sin
the
atonement
requires
constant
on
the
sinner
part
that
god
wrath
should
be
vented
upon
his
beloved
son
is
divinely
unnatural
such
a
theory
is
the
atonement
is
a
hard
problem
in
theology
but
its
tific
explanation
is
that
suffering
is
an
error
of
sinful
sense
which
truth
destroys
and
that
eventually
both
sin
and
fering
will
fall
at
the
feet
of
everlasting
love
doctrines
and
faith
rabbinical
lore
said
he
that
taketh
one
doctrine
firm
in
faith
has
the
holy
ghost
dwelling
in
him
this
preaching
receives
a
strong
rebuke
in
the
scripture
faith
without
works
is
dead
faith
if
it
be
mere
belief
is
as
a
pendulum
swinging
tween
nothing
and
something
having
no
fixity
faith
advanced
to
spiritual
understanding
is
the
evidence
gained
from
spirit
which
rebukes
sin
of
every
kind
and
lishes
the
claims
of
god
and
confidence
in
hebrew
greek
latin
and
english
and
the
words
corresponding
thereto
have
these
two
tions
and
one
kind
of
faith
trusts
one
welfare
to
others
another
kind
of
faith
understands
divine
love
and
how
to
work
out
one
own
salvation
with
fear
and
bling
lord
i
believe
help
thou
mine
unbelief
expresses
the
helplessness
of
a
blind
faith
whereas
the
injunction
believe
and
thou
shalt
be
saved
demands
trustworthiness
which
includes
itual
understanding
and
confides
all
to
god
the
hebrew
verb
means
also
be
or
be
this
certainly
applies
to
truth
and
love
understood
and
practised
firmness
in
error
will
never
save
from
sin
disease
and
death
life
healing
currents
acquaintance
with
the
original
texts
and
willingness
to
give
up
human
beliefs
established
by
hierarchies
and
instigated
sometimes
by
the
worst
passions
of
men
open
the
way
for
christian
science
to
be
understood
and
make
the
bible
the
chart
of
life
where
the
buoys
and
healing
currents
of
truth
are
pointed
out
radical
changes
he
to
whom
the
arm
of
the
lord
is
revealed
will
believe
our
report
and
rise
into
newness
of
life
with
generation
this
is
having
part
in
the
ment
this
is
the
understanding
in
which
jesus
suffered
and
triumphed
the
time
is
not
distant
when
the
ordinary
theological
views
of
atonement
will
undergo
a
great
change
a
change
as
radical
as
that
which
has
come
over
popular
opinions
in
regard
to
destination
and
future
punishment
purpose
of
crucifixion
does
erudite
theology
regard
the
crucifixion
of
jesus
chiefly
as
providing
a
ready
pardon
for
all
sinners
who
ask
for
it
and
are
willing
to
be
forgiven
does
spiritualism
find
jesus
death
necessary
only
for
the
presentation
after
death
of
the
material
jesus
as
a
proof
that
spirits
can
return
to
earth
then
we
must
differ
from
them
both
the
efficacy
of
the
crucifixion
lay
in
the
practical
fection
and
goodness
it
demonstrated
for
mankind
the
truth
had
been
lived
among
men
but
until
they
saw
that
it
enabled
their
master
to
triumph
over
the
grave
his
own
disciples
could
not
admit
such
an
event
to
be
possible
after
the
resurrection
even
the
unbelieving
thomas
was
forced
to
acknowledge
how
complete
was
the
great
proof
of
truth
and
love
true
flesh
and
blood
the
spiritual
essence
of
blood
is
sacrifice
the
cacy
of
jesus
spiritual
offering
is
infinitely
greater
than
can
be
expressed
by
our
sense
of
human
blood
the
material
blood
of
jesus
was
no
more
efficacious
to
cleanse
from
sin
when
it
was
shed
upon
the
accursed
tree
than
when
it
was
flowing
in
his
veins
as
he
went
daily
about
his
father
business
his
true
flesh
and
blood
were
his
life
and
they
truly
eat
his
flesh
and
drink
his
blood
who
partake
of
that
divine
life
effective
triumph
jesus
taught
the
way
of
life
by
demonstration
that
we
may
understand
how
this
divine
principle
heals
the
sick
casts
out
error
and
triumphs
over
death
jesus
presented
the
ideal
of
god
better
than
could
any
man
whose
origin
was
less
spiritual
by
his
obedience
to
god
he
demonstrated
more
ally
than
all
others
the
principle
of
being
hence
the
force
of
his
admonition
if
ye
love
me
keep
my
mandments
though
demonstrating
his
control
over
sin
and
disease
the
great
teacher
by
no
means
relieved
others
from
giving
the
requisite
proofs
of
their
own
piety
he
worked
for
their
guidance
that
they
might
demonstrate
this
power
as
he
did
and
understand
its
divine
principle
implicit
faith
in
the
teacher
and
all
the
emotional
love
we
can
bestow
on
him
will
never
alone
make
us
imitators
of
him
we
must
go
and
do
likewise
else
we
are
not
improving
the
great
blessings
which
our
master
worked
and
suffered
to
bestow
upon
us
the
divinity
of
the
christ
was
made
manifest
in
the
humanity
of
jesus
individual
experience
while
we
adore
jesus
and
the
heart
overflows
with
gratitude
for
what
he
did
for
mortals
treading
alone
his
loving
pathway
up
to
the
throne
of
glory
in
speechless
agony
exploring
the
way
for
us
yet
jesus
spares
us
not
one
individual
rience
if
we
follow
his
commands
faithfully
and
all
have
the
cup
of
sorrowful
effort
to
drink
in
proportion
to
their
demonstration
of
his
love
till
all
are
redeemed
through
divine
love
christ
demonstration
the
christ
was
the
spirit
which
jesus
implied
in
his
own
statements
i
am
the
way
the
truth
and
the
life
i
and
my
father
are
one
this
christ
or
divinity
of
the
man
jesus
was
his
divine
nature
the
godliness
which
animated
him
divine
truth
life
and
love
gave
jesus
authority
over
sin
sickness
and
death
his
mission
was
to
reveal
the
science
of
celestial
being
to
prove
what
god
is
and
what
he
does
for
man
proof
in
practice
a
musician
demonstrates
the
beauty
of
the
music
he
teaches
in
order
to
show
the
learner
the
way
by
tice
as
well
as
precept
jesus
teaching
and
practice
of
truth
involved
such
a
sacrifice
as
makes
us
admit
its
principle
to
be
love
this
was
the
precious
import
of
our
master
sinless
career
and
of
his
demonstration
of
power
over
death
he
proved
by
his
deeds
that
christian
science
destroys
sickness
sin
and
death
our
master
taught
no
mere
theory
doctrine
or
belief
it
was
the
divine
principle
of
all
real
being
which
he
taught
and
practised
his
proof
of
christianity
was
no
form
or
system
of
religion
and
worship
but
christian
science
working
out
the
harmony
of
life
and
love
jesus
sent
a
message
to
john
the
baptist
which
was
tended
to
prove
beyond
a
question
that
the
christ
had
come
go
your
way
and
tell
john
what
things
ye
have
seen
and
heard
how
that
the
blind
see
the
lame
walk
the
lepers
are
cleansed
the
deaf
hear
the
dead
are
raised
to
the
poor
the
gospel
is
preached
in
other
words
tell
john
what
the
demonstration
of
divine
power
is
and
he
will
at
once
perceive
that
god
is
the
power
in
the
messianic
work
living
temple
that
life
is
god
jesus
proved
by
his
reappearance
after
the
crucifixion
in
strict
accordance
with
his
tific
statement
destroy
this
temple
body
and
in
three
days
i
spirit
will
raise
it
up
it
is
as
if
he
had
said
the
i
the
life
substance
and
intelligence
of
the
universe
is
not
in
matter
to
be
destroyed
jesus
parables
explain
life
as
never
mingling
with
sin
and
death
he
laid
the
axe
of
science
at
the
root
of
material
knowledge
that
it
might
be
ready
to
cut
down
the
false
doctrine
of
pantheism
that
god
or
life
is
in
or
of
matter
recreant
disciples
jesus
sent
forth
seventy
students
at
one
time
but
only
eleven
left
a
desirable
historic
record
tradition
credits
him
with
two
or
three
hundred
other
disciples
who
have
left
no
name
many
are
called
but
few
are
chosen
they
fell
away
from
grace
because
they
never
truly
understood
their
master
instruction
why
do
those
who
profess
to
follow
christ
reject
the
essential
religion
he
came
to
establish
jesus
tors
made
their
strongest
attack
upon
this
very
point
they
endeavored
to
hold
him
at
the
mercy
of
matter
and
to
kill
him
according
to
certain
assumed
material
laws
help
and
hindrance
the
pharisees
claimed
to
know
and
to
teach
the
vine
will
but
they
only
hindered
the
success
of
mission
even
many
of
his
students
stood
in
his
way
if
the
master
had
not
taken
a
student
and
taught
the
unseen
verities
of
god
he
would
not
have
been
crucified
the
determination
to
hold
spirit
in
the
grasp
of
matter
is
the
persecutor
of
truth
and
love
while
respecting
all
that
is
good
in
the
church
or
out
of
it
one
consecration
to
christ
is
more
on
the
ground
of
demonstration
than
of
profession
in
conscience
we
can
not
hold
to
beliefs
outgrown
and
by
understanding
more
of
the
divine
principle
of
the
deathless
christ
we
are
enabled
to
heal
the
sick
and
to
triumph
over
sin
misleading
conceptions
neither
the
origin
the
character
nor
the
work
of
jesus
was
generally
understood
not
a
single
nent
part
of
his
nature
did
the
material
world
measure
aright
even
his
less
and
purity
did
not
hinder
men
from
saying
he
is
a
glutton
and
a
friend
of
the
impure
and
beelzebub
is
his
patron
persecution
prolonged
remember
thou
christian
martyr
it
is
enough
if
thou
art
found
worthy
to
unloose
the
sandals
of
thy
master
feet
to
suppose
that
persecution
for
righteousness
sake
belongs
to
the
past
and
that
christianity
is
at
peace
with
the
world
because
it
is
honored
by
sects
and
societies
is
to
take
the
very
nature
of
religion
error
repeats
itself
the
trials
encountered
by
prophet
disciple
and
apostle
of
whom
the
world
was
not
worthy
await
in
some
form
every
pioneer
of
truth
christian
warfare
there
is
too
much
animal
courage
in
society
and
not
sufficient
moral
courage
christians
must
take
up
arms
against
error
at
home
and
abroad
they
must
grapple
with
sin
in
themselves
and
in
others
and
continue
this
warfare
until
they
have
finished
their
course
if
they
keep
the
faith
they
will
have
the
crown
of
rejoicing
christian
experience
teaches
faith
in
the
right
and
belief
in
the
wrong
it
bids
us
work
the
more
earnestly
in
times
of
persecution
because
then
our
labor
is
more
needed
great
is
the
reward
of
though
we
may
never
receive
it
in
this
world
the
fatherhood
of
god
there
is
a
tradition
that
publius
lentulus
wrote
to
the
authorities
at
rome
the
disciples
of
jesus
lieve
him
the
son
of
god
those
instructed
in
christian
science
have
reached
the
ous
perception
that
god
is
the
only
author
of
man
the
conceived
this
idea
of
god
and
gave
to
her
ideal
the
name
of
jesus
that
is
joshua
or
saviour
spiritual
conception
the
illumination
of
mary
spiritual
sense
put
to
silence
material
law
and
its
order
of
generation
and
brought
forth
her
child
by
the
revelation
of
truth
demonstrating
god
as
the
father
of
men
the
holy
ghost
or
divine
spirit
overshadowed
the
pure
sense
of
the
with
the
full
nition
that
being
is
spirit
the
christ
dwelt
forever
an
idea
in
the
bosom
of
god
the
divine
principle
of
the
man
jesus
and
woman
perceived
this
spiritual
idea
though
at
first
faintly
developed
man
as
the
offspring
of
god
as
the
idea
of
spirit
is
the
immortal
evidence
that
spirit
is
harmonious
and
man
eternal
jesus
was
the
offspring
of
mary
conscious
communion
with
god
hence
he
could
give
a
more
spiritual
idea
of
life
than
other
men
and
could
demonstrate
the
science
of
love
his
father
or
divine
principle
jesus
the
born
of
a
woman
jesus
advent
in
the
flesh
partook
partly
of
mary
earthly
condition
although
he
was
dowed
with
the
christ
the
divine
spirit
out
measure
this
accounts
for
his
struggles
in
gethsemane
and
on
calvary
and
this
enabled
him
to
be
the
mediator
or
between
god
and
men
had
his
origin
and
birth
been
wholly
apart
from
mortal
usage
jesus
would
not
have
been
appreciable
to
mortal
mind
as
the
way
rabbi
and
priest
taught
the
mosaic
law
which
said
an
eye
for
an
eye
and
whoso
sheddeth
man
blood
by
man
shall
his
blood
be
shed
not
so
did
jesus
the
new
executor
for
god
present
the
divine
law
of
love
which
blesses
even
those
that
curse
it
rebukes
helpful
as
the
individual
ideal
of
truth
christ
jesus
came
to
rebuke
rabbinical
error
and
all
sin
sickness
and
death
to
point
out
the
way
of
truth
and
life
this
ideal
was
demonstrated
throughout
the
whole
earthly
career
of
jesus
showing
the
difference
between
the
offspring
of
soul
and
of
material
sense
of
truth
and
of
error
if
we
have
triumphed
sufficiently
over
the
errors
of
material
sense
to
allow
soul
to
hold
the
control
we
shall
loathe
sin
and
rebuke
it
under
every
mask
only
in
this
way
can
we
bless
our
enemies
though
they
may
not
so
construe
our
words
we
can
not
choose
for
ourselves
but
must
work
out
our
salvation
in
the
way
jesus
taught
in
meekness
and
might
he
was
found
preaching
the
gospel
to
the
poor
pride
and
fear
are
unfit
to
bear
the
standard
of
truth
and
god
will
never
place
it
in
such
hands
fleshly
ties
temporal
jesus
acknowledged
no
ties
of
the
flesh
he
said
call
no
man
your
father
upon
the
earth
for
one
is
your
father
which
is
in
heaven
again
he
asked
who
is
my
mother
and
who
are
my
brethren
plying
that
it
is
they
who
do
the
will
of
his
father
we
have
no
record
of
his
calling
any
man
by
the
name
of
he
recognized
spirit
god
as
the
only
creator
and
therefore
as
the
father
of
all
healing
primary
first
in
the
list
of
christian
duties
he
taught
his
lowers
the
healing
power
of
truth
and
love
he
attached
no
importance
to
dead
ceremonies
it
is
the
living
christ
the
practical
truth
which
makes
jesus
the
resurrection
and
the
life
to
all
who
follow
him
in
deed
obeying
his
precious
precepts
following
his
demonstration
so
far
as
we
apprehend
it
we
drink
of
his
cup
partake
of
his
bread
are
baptized
with
his
rity
and
at
last
we
shall
rest
sit
down
with
him
in
a
full
understanding
of
the
divine
principle
which
triumphs
over
death
for
what
says
paul
as
often
as
ye
eat
this
bread
and
drink
this
cup
ye
do
show
the
death
till
he
come
painful
prospect
referring
to
the
materiality
of
the
age
jesus
said
the
hour
cometh
and
now
is
when
the
true
shippers
shall
worship
the
father
in
spirit
and
in
truth
again
foreseeing
the
cution
which
would
attend
the
science
of
spirit
jesus
said
they
shall
put
you
out
of
the
synagogues
yea
the
time
cometh
that
whosoever
killeth
you
will
think
that
he
doeth
god
service
and
these
things
will
they
do
unto
you
because
they
have
not
known

father
nor
me
sacred
sacrament
in
ancient
rome
a
soldier
was
required
to
swear
allegiance
to
his
general
the
latin
word
for
this
oath
was
and
our
english
word
is
derived
from
it
among
the
jews
it
was
an
ancient
custom
for
the
master
of
a
feast
to
pass
each
guest
a
cup
of
wine
but
the
eucharist
does
not
commemorate
a
roman
oath
nor
was
the
wine
used
on
convivial
occasions
and
in
jewish
rites
the
cup
of
our
lord
the
cup
shows
forth
his
bitter
experience
the
cup
which
he
prayed
might
pass
from
him
though
he
bowed
in
holy
sion
to
the
divine
decree
as
they
were
eating
jesus
took
bread
and
blessed
it
and
brake
it
and
gave
it
to
the
disciples
and
said
take
eat
this
is
my
body
and
he
took
the
cup
and
gave
thanks
and
gave
it
to
them
saying
drink
ye
all
of
it
spiritual
refreshment
the
true
sense
is
spiritually
lost
if
the
sacrament
is
confined
to
the
use
of
bread
and
wine
the
disciples
had
eaten
yet
jesus
prayed
and
gave
them
bread
this
would
have
been
foolish
in
a
literal
sense
but
in
its
spiritual
signification
it
was
ural
and
beautiful
jesus
prayed
he
withdrew
from
the
material
senses
to
refresh
his
heart
with
brighter
with
spiritual
views

the
passover
which
jesus
ate
with
his
disciples
in
the
month
nisan
on
the
night
before
his
crucifixion
was
a
mournful
occasion
a
sad
supper
taken
at
the
close
of
day
in
the
twilight
of
a
glorious
career
with
shadows
fast
falling
around
and
this
supper
closed
forever
jesus

or
concessions
to

supplies
his
followers
sorrowful
and
silent
anticipating
the
hour
of
their
master
betrayal
partook
of
the
heavenly
manna
which
of
old
had
fed
in
the
wilderness
the
persecuted
followers
of
truth
their
bread
indeed
came
down
from
heaven
it
was
the
great
truth
of
spiritual
being
healing
the
sick
and
casting
out
error
their
master
had
explained
it
all
before
and
now
this
bread
was
feeding
and
sustaining
them
they
had
borne
this
bread
from
house
to
house
explaining
it
to
others
and
now
it
comforted
themselves
for
this
truth
of
spiritual
being
their
master
was
about
to
suffer
violence
and
drain
to
the
dregs
his
cup
of
sorrow
he
must
leave
them
with
the
great
glory
of
an
ing
victory
overshadowing
him
he
gave
thanks
and
said
drink
ye
all
of
it
the
holy
struggle
when
the
human
element
in
him
struggled
with
the
divine
our
great
teacher
said
not
my
will
but
thine
be
done
that
is
let
not
the
flesh
but
the
spirit
be
represented
in
me
this
is
the
new
understanding
of
spiritual
love
it
gives
all
for
christ
or
truth
it
blesses
its
enemies
heals
the
sick
casts
out

raises
the
dead
from
trespasses
and
sins
and
preaches
the
gospel
to
the
poor

incisive
questions
christians
are
you
drinking
his
cup
have
you
shared
the
blood
of
the
new
covenant
the
persecutions
which
attend
a
new
and
higher
ing
of
god
if
not
can
you
then
say
that
you
have
commemorated
jesus
in
his
cup
are
all
who
eat
bread
and
drink
wine
in
memory
of
jesus
willing
truly
to
drink
his
cup
take
his
cross
and
leave
all
for
the
then
why
ascribe
this
tion
to
a
dead
rite
instead
of
showing
by
casting
out
error
and
making
the
body
holy
acceptable
unto
god
that
truth
has
come
to
the
understanding
if
christ
truth
has
come
to
us
in
demonstration
no
other
memoration
is
requisite
for
demonstration
is
immanuel
or
with
and
if
a
friend
be
with
us
why
need
we
memorials
of
that
friend
millennial
glory
if
all
who
ever
partook
of
the
sacrament
had
really
commemorated
the
sufferings
of
jesus
and
drunk
of
his
cup
they
would
have
revolutionized
the
world
if
all
who
seek
his
commemoration
through
material
symbols
will
take
up
the
cross
heal
the
sick
cast
out
evils
and
preach
christ
or
truth
to
the
poor
the
receptive
thought
they
will
bring
in
the
millennium
fellowship
with
christ
through
all
the
disciples
experienced
they
became
more
spiritual
and
understood
better
what
the
master
had
taught
his
resurrection
was
also
their
rection
it
helped
them
to
raise
themselves
and
others
from
spiritual
dulness
and
blind
belief
in
god
into
the
perception
of
infinite
possibilities
they
needed
this
quickening
for
soon
their
dear
master
would
rise
again
in
the
spiritual
realm
of
reality
and
ascend
far
above
their
apprehension
as
the
reward
for
his
faithfulness
he
would
disappear
to
material
sense
in
that
change
which
has
since
been
called
the
ascension
the
last
breakfast
what
a
contrast
between
our
lord
last
supper
and
his
last
spiritual
breakfast
with
his
disciples
in
the
bright
morning
hours
at
the
joyful
meeting
on
the
shore
of
the
galilean
sea
his
gloom
had
passed
into
glory
and
his
disciples
grief
into
ance
hearts
chastened
and
pride
rebuked
convinced
of
the
fruitlessness
of
their
toil
in
the
dark
and
wakened
by
their
master
voice
they
changed
their
methods
turned
away
from
material
things
and
cast
their
net
on
the
right
side
discerning
christ
truth
anew
on
the
shore
of
time
they
were
enabled
to
rise
somewhat
from
mortal
sensuousness
or
the
burial
of
mind
in
matter
into
ness
of
life
as
spirit
this
spiritual
meeting
with
our
lord
in
the
dawn
of
a
new
light
is
the
morning
meal
which
christian
scientists
commemorate
they
bow
before
christ
truth
to
ceive
more
of
his
reappearing
and
silently
to
commune
with
the
divine
principle
love
they
celebrate
their
lord
victory
over
death
his
probation
in
the
flesh
after
death
its
exemplification
of
human
probation
and
his
spiritual
and
final
ascension
above
matter
or
the
flesh
when
he
rose
out
of
material
sight
spiritual
eucharist
our
baptism
is
a
purification
from
all
error
our
church
is
built
on
the
divine
principle
love
we
can
unite
with
this
church
only
as
we
are
born
of
spirit
as
we
reach
the
life
which
is
truth
and
the
truth
which
is
life
by
bringing
forth
the
fruits
of
love
casting
out
error
and
healing
the
sick
our
eucharist
is
spiritual
communion
with
the
one
god
our
bread
which
cometh
down
from
heaven
is
truth
our
cup
is
the
cross
our
wine
the
tion
of
love
the
draught
our
master
drank
and
mended
to
his
followers
final
purpose
the
design
of
love
is
to
reform
the
sinner
if
the
sinner
punishment
here
has
been
insufficient
to
form
him
the
good
man
heaven
would
be
a
hell
to
the
sinner
they
who
know
not
purity
and
affection
by
experience
can
never
find
bliss
in
the
blessed
company
of
truth
and
love
simply
through
translation
into
another
sphere
divine
science
reveals
the
necessity
of
sufficient
suffering
either
before
or
after
death
to
quench
the
love
of
sin
to
remit
the
penalty
due
for
sin
would
be
for
truth
to
pardon
error
escape
from
punishment
is
not
in
accordance
with
god
ment
since
justice
is
the
handmaid
of
mercy
jesus
endured
the
shame
that
he
might
pour
his
bounty
into
barren
lives
what
was
his
earthly
reward
he
was
forsaken
by
all
save
john
the
beloved
disciple
and
a
few
women
who
bowed
in
silent
woe
beneath
the
shadow
of
his
cross
the
earthly
price
of
spirituality
in
a
material
age
and
the
great
moral
distance
between
christianity
and
sensualism
preclude
christian
science
from
finding
favor
with
the
minded
righteous
retribution
a
selfish
and
limited
mind
may
be
unjust
but
the
limited
and
divine
mind
is
the
immortal
law
of
justice
as
well
as
of
mercy
it
is
quite
as
impossible
for
sinners
to
receive
their
full
punishment
this
side
of
the
grave
as
for
this
world
to
bestow
on
the
eous
their
full
reward
it
is
useless
to
suppose
that
the
wicked
can
gloat
over
their
offences
to
the
last
moment
and
then
be
suddenly
pardoned
and
pushed
into
heaven
or
that
the
hand
of
love
is
satisfied
with
giving
us
only
toil
sacrifice
multiplied
trials
and
ery
of
our
motives
in
return
for
our
efforts
at
well
doing
vicarious
suffering
religious
history
repeats
itself
in
the
fering
of
the
just
for
the
unjust
can
god
therefore
overlook
the
law
of
righteousness
which
stroys
the
belief
called
sin
does
not
science
show
that
sin
brings
suffering
as
much
as
yesterday
they
who
sin
must
suffer
with
what
measure
ye
mete
it
shall
be
measured
to
you
again
martyrs
inevitable
history
is
full
of
records
of
suffering
the
blood
of
the
martyrs
is
the
seed
of
the
church
mortals
try
in
vain
to
slay
truth
with
the
steel
or
the
stake
but
error
falls
only
before
the
sword
of
spirit
martyrs
are
the
human
links
which
connect
one
stage
with
another
in
the
history
of
religion
they
are
earth
naries
which
serve
to
cleanse
and
rarefy
the
atmosphere
of
material
sense
and
to
permeate
humanity
with
purer
ideals
consciousness
of
brings
its
own
reward
but
not
amid
the
smoke
of
battle
is
merit
seen
and
appreciated
by
complete
emulation
when
will
jesus
professed
followers
learn
to
emulate
him
in
his
ways
and
to
imitate
his
mighty
works
those
who
procured
the
martyrdom
of
that
righteous
man
would
gladly
have
turned
his
sacred
career
into
a
mutilated
doctrinal
platform
may
the
christians
of
take
up
the
more
practical
port
of
that
career
it
is
possible
yea
it
is
the
duty
and
privilege
of
every
child
man
and
woman
to
follow
in
some
degree
the
example
of
the
master
by
the
stration
of
truth
and
life
of
health
and
holiness
tians
claim
to
be
his
followers
but
do
they
follow
him
in
the
way
that
he
commanded
hear
these
imperative
mands
be
ye
therefore
perfect
even
as
your
father
which
is
in
heaven
is
perfect
go
ye
into
all
the
world
and
preach
the
gospel
to
every
creature
the
jesus
teaching
belittled
why
has
this
christian
demand
so
little
inspiration
to
stir
mankind
to
christian
effort
because
men
are
assured
that
this
command
was
intended
only
for
a
ticular
period
and
for
a
select
number
of
lowers
this
teaching
is
even
more
pernicious
than
the
old
doctrine
of
foreordination
the
election
of
a
few
to
be
saved
while
the
rest
are
damned
and
so
it
will
be
considered
when
the
lethargy
of
mortals
produced
by
doctrines
is
broken
by
the
demands
of
divine
science
jesus
said
these
signs
shall
follow
them
that
lieve
they
shall
lay
hands
on
the
sick
and
they
shall
recover
who
believes
him
he
was
addressing
his
disciples
yet
he
did
not
say
these
signs
shall
follow
but
them
that
believe
in
all
time
to
come
here
the
word
is
used
metaphorically
as
in
the
text
the
right
hand
of
the
lord
is
exalted
it
expresses
spiritual
power
otherwise
the
healing
could
not
have
been
done
spiritually
at
another
time
jesus
prayed
not
for
the
twelve
only
but
for
as
many
as
should
believe
through
their
word
material
pleasures
jesus
experienced
few
of
the
pleasures
of
the
physical
senses
but
his
sufferings
were
the
fruits
of
other
ple
sins
not
of
his
own
the
eternal
christ
his
spiritual
selfhood
never
suffered
jesus
mapped
out
the
path
for
others
he
unveiled
the
christ
the
spiritual
idea
of
divine
love
to
those
buried
in
the
belief
of
sin
and
self
living
only
for
pleasure
or
the
fication
of
the
senses
he
said
in
substance
having
eyes
ye
see
not
and
having
ears
ye
hear
not
lest
ye
should
derstand
and
be
converted
and
i
might
heal
you
he
taught
that
the
material
senses
shut
out
truth
and
its
healing
power
mockery
of
truth
meekly
our
master
met
the
mockery
of
his
nized
grandeur
such
indignities
as
he
received
his
lowers
will
endure
until
christianity
last
triumph
he
won
eternal
honors
he
came
the
world
the
flesh
and
all
error
thus
proving
their
nothingness
he
wrought
a
full
salvation
from
sin
sickness
and
death
we
need
christ
and
him
fied
we
must
have
trials
and
as
well
as
joys
and
victories
until
all
error
is
destroyed
a
belief
suicidal
the
educated
belief
that
soul
is
in
the
body
causes
mortals
to
regard
death
as
a
friend
as
a
out
of
mortality
into
immortality
and
bliss
the
bible
calls
death
an
enemy
and
jesus
overcame
death
and
the
grave
instead
of
yielding
to
them
he
was
the
way
to
him
therefore
death
was
not
the
threshold
over
which
he
must
pass
into
living
glory
present
salvation
cried
the
apostle
is
the
accepted
time
hold
is
the
day
of
salvation
meaning
not
that
now
men
must
prepare
for
a
tion
or
safety
but
that
now
is
the
time
in
which
to
experience
that
salvation
in
spirit
and
in
life
now
is
the
time
for
material
pains
and
material
ures
to
pass
away
for
both
are
unreal
because
impossible
in
science
to
break
this
earthly
spell
mortals
must
get
the
true
idea
and
divine
principle
of
all
that
really
exists
and
governs
the
universe
harmoniously
this
thought
is
apprehended
slowly
and
the
interval
before
its
ment
is
attended
with
doubts
and
defeats
as
well
as
triumphs
sin
and
penalty
who
will
stop
the
practice
of
sin
so
long
as
he
believes
in
the
pleasures
of
sin
when
mortals
once
admit
that
evil
confers
no
pleasure
they
turn
from
it
remove
error
from
thought
and
it
will
not
appear
in
effect
the
vanced
thinker
and
devout
christian
ing
the
scope
and
tendency
of
christian
healing
and
its
science
will
support
them
another
will
say
go
thy
way
for
this
time
when
i
have
a
convenient
season
i
will
call
for
thee
divine
science
adjusts
the
balance
as
jesus
adjusted
it
science
removes
the
penalty
only
by
first
removing
the
sin
which
incurs
the
penalty
this
is
my
sense
of
divine
pardon
which
i
understand
to
mean
god
method
of
destroying
sin
if
the
saying
is
true
while
life
there
hope
its
opposite
is
also
true
while
sin
there
doom
another
suffering
can
not
lessen
our
own
liability
did
the
martyrdom
of
savonarola
make
the
crimes
of
his
implacable
enemies
less
criminal
suffering
inevitable
was
it
just
for
jesus
to
suffer
no
but
it
was
inevitable
for
not
otherwise
could
he
show
us
the
way
and
the
power
of
truth
if
a
career
so
great
and
good
as
that
of
jesus
could
not
avert
a
felon
fate
lesser
apostles
of
truth
may
endure
human
brutality
without
murmuring
rejoicing
to
enter
into
fellowship
with
him
through
the
triumphal
arch
of
truth
and
love
service
and
worship
our
heavenly
father
divine
love
demands
that
all
men
should
follow
the
example
of
our
master
and
his
apostles
and
not
merely
worship
his
ity
it
is
sad
that
the
phrase
has
come
so
generally
to
mean
public
worship
instead
of
daily
deeds
within
the
veil
the
nature
of
christianity
is
peaceful
and
blessed
but
in
order
to
enter
into
the
kingdom
the
anchor
of
hope
must
be
cast
beyond
the
veil
of
matter
into
the
shekinah
into
which
jesus
has
passed
before
us
and
this
advance
beyond
matter
must
come
through
the
joys
and
triumphs
of
the
eous
as
well
as
through
their
sorrows
and
afflictions
like
our
master
we
must
depart
from
material
sense
into
the
spiritual
sense
of
being
the
thorns
and
flowers
the
walk
calmly
on
though
it
be
with
bleeding
footprints
and
in
the
hereafter
they
will
reap
what
they
now
sow
the
pampered
crite
may
have
a
flowery
pathway
here
but
he
can
not
forever
break
the
golden
rule
and
escape
the
penalty
due
healing
early
lost
the
proofs
of
truth
life
and
love
which
jesus
gave
by
casting
out
error
and
healing
the
sick
completed
his
earthly
mission
but
in
the
christian
church
this
demonstration
of
healing
was
early
lost
about
three
centuries
after
the
crucifixion
no
ancient
school
of
philosophy
or
scholastic
ogy
ever
taught
or
demonstrated
the
divine
healing
of
absolute
science
immortal
achieval
jesus
foresaw
the
reception
christian
science
would
have
before
it
was
understood
but
this
foreknowledge
hindered
him
not
he
fulfilled
his
and
then
sat
down
at
the
right
hand
of
the
father
persecuted
from
city
to
city
his
apostles
still
went
about
doing
good
deeds
for
which
they
were
maligned
and
stoned
the
truth
taught
by
jesus
the
elders
scoffed
at
why
because
it
demanded
more
than
they
were
willing
to
practise
it
was
enough
for
them
to
believe
in
a
national
deity
but
that
belief
from
their
time
to
ours
has
never
made
a
disciple
who
could
cast
out
evils
and
heal
the
sick
jesus
life
proved
divinely
and
scientifically
that
god
is
love
whereas
priest
and
rabbi
affirmed
god
to
be
a
mighty
potentate
who
loves
and
hates
the
jewish
ology
gave
no
hint
of
the
unchanging
love
of
god
a
belief
in
death
the
universal
belief
in
death
is
of
no
advantage
it
can
not
make
life
or
truth
apparent
death
will
be
found
at
length
to
be
a
mortal
dream
which
comes
in
darkness
and
disappears
with
the
light
cruel
desertion
the
man
of
sorrows
was
in
no
peril
from
salary
or
popularity
though
entitled
to
the
homage
of
the
world
and
endorsed
by
the
approval
of
god
his
brief
triumphal
entry
into
lem
was
followed
by
the
desertion
of
all
save
a
few
friends
who
sadly
followed
him
to
the
foot
of
the
cross
death
outdone
the
resurrection
of
the
great
demonstrator
of
power
was
the
proof
of
his
final
triumph
over
body
and
matter
and
gave
full
evidence
of
divine
science
evidence
so
important
to
mortals
the
belief
that
man
has
existence
or
mind
separate
from
god
is
a
dying
error
this
error
jesus
met
with
divine
science
and
proved
its
nothingness
because
of
the
drous
glory
which
god
bestowed
on
his
anointed
tation
sin
sickness
and
death
had
no
terror
for
jesus
let
men
think
they
had
killed
the
body
afterwards
he
would
show
it
to
them
unchanged
this
demonstrates
that
in
christian
science
the
true
man
is
governed
by
god
by
good
not
evil
and
is
therefore
not
a
mortal
but
an
immortal
jesus
had
taught
his
disciples
the
science
of
this
proof
he
was
here
to
enable
them
to
test
his
still
uncomprehended
saying
he
that
eth
on
me
the
works
that
i
do
shall
he
do
also
they
must
understand
more
fully
his
by
casting
out
error
healing
the
sick
and
raising
the
dead
even
as
they
did
understand
it
after
his
bodily
departure
pentecost
repeated
the
magnitude
of
jesus
work
his
material
ance
before
their
eyes
and
his
reappearance
all
enabled
the
disciples
to
understand
what
jesus
had
said
heretofore
they
had
only
believed
now
they
understood
the
advent
of
this
understanding
is
what
is
meant
by
the
descent
of
the
holy
ghost
that
influx
of
divine
science
which
so
illuminated
the
tal
day
and
is
now
repeating
its
ancient
history
convincing
evidence
jesus
last
proof
was
the
highest
the
most
convincing
the
most
profitable
to
his
students
the
malignity
of
brutal
persecutors
the
treason
and
suicide
of
his
betrayer
were
overruled
by
divine
love
to
the
glorification
of
the
man
and
of
the
true
idea
of
god
which
jesus
persecutors
had
mocked
and
tried
to
slay
the
final
demonstration
of
the
truth
which
jesus
taught
and
for
which
he
was
crucified
opened
a
new
era
for
the
world
those
who
slew
him
to
stay
his
influence
ated
and
extended
it
divine
victory
jesus
rose
higher
in
demonstration
because
of
the
cup
of
bitterness
he
drank
human
law
had
condemned
him
but
he
was
demonstrating
divine
science
out
of
reach
of
the
barbarity
of
his
enemies
he
was
acting
under
spiritual
law
in
defiance
of
ter
and
mortality
and
that
spiritual
law
sustained
him
the
divine
must
overcome
the
human
at
every
point
the
science
jesus
taught
and
lived
must
triumph
over
all
material
beliefs
about
life
substance
and
gence
and
the
multitudinous
errors
growing
from
such
beliefs
love
must
triumph
over
hate
truth
and
life
must
seal
the
victory
over
error
and
death
before
the
thorns
can
be
laid
aside
for
a
crown
the
benediction
follow
well
done
good
and
faithful
servant
and
the
acy
of
spirit
be
demonstrated
jesus
in
the
tomb
the
lonely
precincts
of
the
tomb
gave
jesus
a
refuge
from
his
foes
a
place
in
which
to
solve
the
great
problem
of
being
his
three
days
work
in
the
sepulchre
set
the
seal
of
eternity
on
time
he
proved
life
to
be
deathless
and
love
to
be
the
ter
of
hate
he
met
and
mastered
on
the
basis
of
tian
science
the
power
of
mind
over
matter
all
the
claims
of
medicine
surgery
and
hygiene
he
took
no
drugs
to
allay
inflammation
he
did
not
depend
upon
food
or
pure
air
to
resuscitate
wasted
energies
he
did
not
require
the
skill
of
a
surgeon
to
heal
the
torn
palms
and
bind
up
the
wounded
side
and
lacerated
feet
that
he
might
use
those
hands
to
remove
the
napkin
and
and
that
he
might
employ
his
feet
as
before
the
deific
naturalism
could
it
be
called
supernatural
for
the
god
of
nature
to
sustain
jesus
in
his
proof
of
man
truly
derived
power
it
was
a
method
of
surgery
beyond
material
art
but
it
was
not
a
supernatural
act
on
the
contrary
it
was
a
divinely
natural
act
whereby
divinity
brought
to
humanity
the
understanding
of
the
healing
and
revealed
a
method
infinitely
above
that
of
human
invention
obstacles
overcome
his
disciples
believed
jesus
to
be
dead
while
he
was
hidden
in
the
sepulchre
whereas
he
was
alive
strating
within
the
narrow
tomb
the
power
of
spirit
to
overrule
mortal
material
sense
there
were
walls
in
the
way
and
a
great
stone
must
be
rolled
from
the
cave
mouth
but
jesus
vanquished
every
material
obstacle
overcame
every
law
of
matter
and
stepped
forth
from
his
gloomy
crowned
with
the
glory
of
a
sublime
success
an
everlasting
victory
victory
over
the
grave
our
master
fully
and
finally
demonstrated
divine
ence
in
his
victory
over
death
and
the
grave
deed
was
for
the
enlightenment
of
men
and
for
the
salvation
of
the
whole
world
from
sin
sickness
and
death
paul
writes
for
if
when
we
were
enemies
we
were
reconciled
to
god
by
the
seeming
death
of
his
son
much
more
being
reconciled
we
shall
be
saved
by
his
life
three
days
after
his
bodily
burial
he
talked
with
his
disciples
the
persecutors
had
failed
to
hide
mortal
truth
and
love
in
a
sepulchre
the
stone
rolled
away
glory
be
to
god
and
peace
to
the
struggling
hearts
christ
hath
rolled
away
the
stone
from
the
door
of
man
hope
and
faith
and
through
the
lation
and
demonstration
of
life
in
god
hath
elevated
them
to
possible
with
the
spiritual
idea
of
man
and
his
divine
principle
love
after
the
resurrection
they
who
earliest
saw
jesus
after
the
resurrection
and
beheld
the
final
proof
of
all
that
he
had
taught
misconstrued
that
event
even
his
disciples
at
first
called
him
a
spirit
ghost
or
spectre
for
they
believed
his
body
to
be
dead
his
reply
was
spirit
hath
not
flesh
and
bones
as
ye
see
me
have
the
reappearing
of
jesus
was
not
the
return
of
a
spirit
he
presented
the
same
body
that
he
had
before
his
cifixion
and
so
glorified
the
supremacy
of
mind
over
matter
jesus
students
not
sufficiently
advanced
fully
to
derstand
their
master
triumph
did
not
perform
many
wonderful
works
until
they
saw
him
after
his
crucifixion
and
learned
that
he
had
not
died
this
convinced
them
of
the
truthfulness
of
all
that
he
had
taught
spiritual
interpretation
in
the
walk
to
emmaus
jesus
was
known
to
his
friends
by
the
words
which
made
their
hearts
burn
within
them
and
by
the
breaking
of
bread
the
divine
spirit
which
identified
jesus
thus
centuries
ago
has
spoken
through
the
inspired
word
and
will
speak
through
it
in
every
age
and
clime
it
is
revealed
to
the
receptive
heart
and
is
again
seen
casting
out
evil
and
healing
the
sick
corporeality
and
spirit
the
master
said
plainly
that
physique
was
not
spirit
and
after
his
resurrection
he
proved
to
the
physical
senses
that
his
body
was
not
changed
until
he
himself
ascended
or
in
other
words
rose
even
higher
in
the
understanding
of
spirit
god
to
convince
thomas
of
this
jesus
caused
him
to
examine
the
prints
and
the
spiritual
ascension
jesus
unchanged
physical
condition
after
what
seemed
to
be
death
was
followed
by
his
exaltation
above
all
terial
conditions
and
this
exaltation
explained
his
ascension
and
revealed
unmistakably
a
probationary
and
progressive
state
beyond
the
grave
jesus
was
the
way
that
is
he
marked
the
way
for
all
men
in
his
final
demonstration
called
the
sion
which
closed
the
earthly
record
of
jesus
he
rose
above
the
physical
knowledge
of
his
disciples
and
the
material
senses
saw
him
no
more
pentecostal
power
his
students
then
received
the
holy
ghost
by
this
is
meant
that
by
all
they
had
witnessed
and
suffered
they
were
roused
to
an
enlarged
understanding
of
divine
ence
even
to
the
spiritual
interpretation
and
discernment
of
jesus
teachings
and
demonstrations
which
gave
them
a
faint
conception
of
the
life
which
is
god
they
no
longer
measured
man
by
material
sense
after
gaining
the
true
idea
of
their
glorified
master
they
became
better
healers
leaning
no
longer
on
matter
but
on
the
divine
principle
of
their
work
the
influx
of
light
was
sudden
it
was
sometimes
an
overwhelming
power
as
on
the
day
of
pentecost
the
traitor
conspiracy
judas
conspired
against
jesus
the
world
ingratitude
and
hatred
towards
that
just
man
effected
his
betrayal
the
traitor
price
was
thirty
pieces
of
silver
and
the
smiles
of
the
pharisees
he
chose
his
time
when
the
people
were
in
doubt
concerning
teachings
a
period
was
approaching
which
would
reveal
the
finite
distance
between
judas
and
his
master
judas
iscariot
knew
this
he
knew
that
the
great
goodness
of
that
master
placed
a
gulf
between
jesus
and
his
betrayer
and
this
spiritual
distance
inflamed
judas
envy
the
greed
for
gold
strengthened
his
ingratitude
and
for
a
time
quieted
his
remorse
he
knew
that
the
world
generally
loves
a
lie
better
than
truth
and
so
he
plotted
the
trayal
of
jesus
in
order
to
raise
himself
in
popular
mation
his
dark
plot
fell
to
the
ground
and
the
traitor
fell
with
it
the
disciples
desertion
of
their
master
in
his
last
earthly
struggle
was
punished
each
one
came
to
a
lent
death
except
john
of
whose
death
we
have
no
record
gethsemane
glorified
during
his
night
of
gloom
and
glory
in
the
garden
jesus
realized
the
utter
error
of
a
belief
in
any
ble
material
intelligence
the
pangs
of
neglect
and
the
staves
of
bigoted
ignorance
smote
him
sorely
his
dents
slept
he
said
unto
them
could
ye
not
watch
with
me
one
hour
could
they
not
watch
with
him
who
waiting
and
struggling
in
less
agony
held
uncomplaining
guard
over
a
world
there
was
no
response
to
that
human
yearning
and
so
jesus
turned
forever
away
from
earth
to
heaven
from
sense
to
soul
remembering
the
sweat
of
agony
which
fell
in
holy
benediction
on
the
grass
of
gethsemane
shall
the
blest
or
mightiest
disciple
murmur
when
he
drinks
from
the
same
cup
and
think
or
even
wish
to
escape
the
ing
ordeal
of
sin
revenge
on
its
destroyer
truth
and
love
bestow
few
palms
until
the
consummation
of
a
defensive
weapons
judas
had
the
world
weapons
jesus
had
not
one
of
them
and
chose
not
the
world
means
of
defence
he
opened
not
his
mouth
the
great
onstrator
of
truth
and
love
was
silent
before
envy
and
hate
peter
would
have
smitten
the
enemies
of
his
master
but
jesus
forbade
him
thus
rebuking
sentment
or
animal
courage
he
said
put
up
thy
sword
pilate
question
pale
in
the
presence
of
his
own
momentous
question
what
is
truth
pilate
was
drawn
into
acquiescence
with
the
demands
of
jesus
enemies
pilate
was
ignorant
of
the
consequences
of
his
awful
decision
against
human
rights
and
divine
love
knowing
not
that
he
was
hastening
the
final
demonstration
of
what
life
is
and
of
what
the
true
knowledge
of
god
can
do
for
man
the
women
at
the
cross
could
have
answered
question
they
knew
what
had
inspired
their
devotion
winged
their
faith
opened
the
eyes
of
their
ing
healed
the
sick
cast
out
evil
and
caused
the
disciples
to
say
to
their
master
even
the
devils
are
subject
unto
us
through
thy
name
students
ingratitude
where
were
the
seventy
whom
jesus
sent
forth
were
all
conspirators
save
eleven
had
they
forgotten
the
great
exponent
of
god
had
they
so
soon
lost
sight
of
his
mighty
works
his
toils
privations
sacrifices
his
divine
patience
sublime
courage
and
quited
affection
o
why
did
they
not
gratify
his
last
human
yearning
with
one
sign
of
fidelity
heaven
sentinel
the
meek
demonstrator
of
good
the
highest
tor
and
friend
of
man
met
his
earthly
fate
alone
with
god
no
human
eye
was
there
to
pity
no
arm
to
save
forsaken
by
all
whom
he
had
blessed
this
faithful
sentinel
of
god
at
the
highest
post
of
power
charged
with
the
grandest
trust
of
heaven
was
ready
to
be
transformed
by
the
renewing
of
the
infinite
spirit
he
was
to
prove
that
the
christ
is
not
subject
to
material
conditions
but
is
above
the
reach
of
human
wrath
and
is
able
through
truth
life
and
love
to
triumph
over
sin
sickness
death
and
the
grave
cruel
contumely
the
priests
and
rabbis
before
whom
he
had
meekly
walked
and
those
to
whom
he
had
given
the
highest
proofs
of
divine
power
mocked
him
on
the
cross
saying
derisively
he
saved
others
himself
he
can
not
save
these
scoffers
who
turned
aside
the
right
of
a
man
before
the
face
of
the
most
high
esteemed
jesus
as
stricken
smitten
of
god
he
is
brought
as
a
lamb
to
the
slaughter
and
as
a
sheep
before
her
shearers
is
dumb
so
he
openeth
not
his
mouth
who
shall
declare
his
generation
who
shall
decide
what
truth
and
love
are
a
cry
of
despair
the
last
supreme
moment
of
mockery
desertion
ture
added
to
an
overwhelming
sense
of
the
magnitude
of
his
work
wrung
from
jesus
lips
the
awful
cry
my
god
why
hast
thou
forsaken
me
this
despairing
appeal
if
made
to
a
human
parent
would
impugn
the
justice
and
love
of
a
father
who
could
hold
a
clear
token
of
his
presence
to
sustain
and
bless
so
faithful
a
son
the
appeal
of
jesus
was
made
both
to
his
divine
principle
the
god
who
is
love
and
to
himself
love
pure
idea
had
life
truth
and
love
forsaken
him
in
his
highest
demonstration
this
was
a
startling
question
no
they
must
abide
in
him
and
he
in
them
or
that
hour
would
be
shorn
of
its
mighty
blessing
for
the
human
race
divine
science
misunderstood
if
his
full
recognition
of
eternal
life
had
for
a
ment
given
way
before
the
evidence
of
the
bodily
senses
what
would
his
accusers
have
said
even
what
they
did
say
that
jesus
teachings
were
false
and
that
all
evidence
of
their
rectness
was
destroyed
by
his
death
but
this
saying
could
not
make
it
so
the
real
pillory
the
burden
of
that
hour
was
terrible
beyond
human
conception
the
distrust
of
mortal
minds
disbelieving
the
purpose
of
his
mission
was
a
million
times
sharper
than
the
thorns
which
pierced
his
flesh
the
real
cross
which
jesus
bore
up
the
hill
of
grief
was
the
world
hatred
of
truth
and
love
not
the
spear
nor
the
material
cross
wrung
from
his
faithful
lips
the
plaintive
cry
eloi
lama
sabachthani
it
was
the
possible
loss
of
something
more
important
than
human
life
which
moved
him
the
possible
hension
of
the
sublimest
influence
of
his
career
this
dread
added
the
drop
of
gall
to
his
cup
indestructible
jesus
could
have
withdrawn
himself
from
his
enemies
he
had
power
to
lay
down
a
human
sense
of
life
for
his
spiritual
identity
in
the
likeness
of
the
divine
but
he
allowed
men
to
attempt
the
tion
of
the
mortal
body
in
order
that
he
might
furnish
the
proof
of
immortal
life
nothing
could
kill
this
life
of
man
jesus
could
give
his
temporal
life
into
his
enemies
hands
but
when
his
was
plished
his
spiritual
life
indestructible
and
eternal
was
found
forever
the
same
he
knew
that
matter
had
no
life
and
that
real
life
is
god
therefore
he
could
no
more
be
separated
from
his
spiritual
life
than
god
could
be
extinguished
example
for
our
salvation
his
consummate
example
was
for
the
salvation
of
us
all
but
only
through
doing
the
works
which
he
did
and
taught
others
to
do
his
purpose
in
healing
was
not
alone
to
restore
health
but
to
strate
his
divine
principle
he
was
inspired
by
god
by
truth
and
love
in
all
that
he
said
and
did
the
motives
of
his
persecutors
were
pride
envy
cruelty
and
vengeance
inflicted
on
the
physical
jesus
but
aimed
at
the
divine
ciple
love
which
rebuked
their
sensuality
jesus
was
unselfish
his
spirituality
separated
him
from
sensuousness
and
caused
the
selfish
materialist
to
hate
him
but
it
was
this
spirituality
which
enabled
jesus
to
heal
the
sick
cast
out
evil
and
raise
the
dead
master
business
from
early
boyhood
he
was
about
his
father
ness
his
pursuits
lay
far
apart
from
theirs
his
ter
was
spirit
their
master
was
matter
he
served
god
they
served
mammon
his
tions
were
pure
theirs
were
carnal
his
senses
drank
in
the
spiritual
evidence
of
health
holiness
and
life
their
senses
testified
oppositely
and
absorbed
the
material
dence
of
sin
sickness
and
death
purity
rebuke
their
imperfections
and
impurity
felt
the
rebuke
of
his
perfection
and
purity
hence
the
hatred
of
the
just
and
perfect
jesus
and
the
prophet
foresight
of
the
reception
error
would
give
him
despised
and
rejected
of
men
was
graphic

concerning
the
coming
prince
of
peace
herod
and
pilate
laid
aside
old
feuds
in
order
to
unite
in
putting
to
shame
and
death
the
best
man
that
ever
trod
the
globe
as
of
old
error
and
evil

common
cause
against
the
exponents
of
truth

prediction
the
man
of
sorrows
best
understood
the
ness
of
material
life
and
intelligence
and
the
mighty
tuality
of
god
good
these
were
the
two
cardinal
points
of
or
christian
science
which
armed
him
with
love
the
est
earthly
representative
of
god
speaking
of
human
ability
to
reflect
divine
power
prophetically
said
to
his
disciples
speaking
not
for
their
day
only
but
for
all
time
he
that
believeth
on
me
the
works
that
i
do
shall
he
do
also
and
these
signs
shall
follow
them
that
believe
defamatory
accusations
the
accusations
of
the
pharisees
were
as
dictory
as
their
religion
the
bigot
the
auchee
the
hypocrite
called
jesus
a
glutton
and
a
they
said
he
casteth
out
devils
through
beelzebub
and
is
the
friend
of
publicans
and
sinners
the
latter
accusation
was
true
but
not
in
their
meaning
jesus
was
no
ascetic
he
did
not
fast
as
did
the
baptist
disciples
yet
there
never
lived
a
man
so
far
removed
from
appetites
and
passions
as
the
nazarene
he
rebuked
sinners
pointedly
and
unflinchingly
because
he
was
their
friend
hence
the
cup
he
drank
reputation
and
character
the
reputation
of
jesus
was
the
very
opposite
of
his
character
why
because
the
divine
principle
and
practice
of
jesus
were
misunderstood
he
was
at
work
in
divine
science
his
words
and
works
were
unknown
to
the
world
because
above
and
contrary
to
the
world
religious
sense
mortals
lieved
in
god
as
humanly
mighty
rather
than
as
divine
infinite
love
inspiring
discontent
the
world
could
not
interpret
aright
the
discomfort
which
jesus
inspired
and
the
spiritual
blessings
which
might
flow
from
such
discomfort
science
shows
the
cause
of
the
shock
so
often
duced
by
the
truth
namely
that
this
shock
arises
from
the
great
distance
between
the
individual
and
truth
like
peter
we
should
weep
over
the
warning
instead
of
denying
the
truth
or
mocking
the
lifelong
sacrifice
which
goodness
makes
for
the
destruction
of
evil
bearing
our
sins
jesus
bore
our
sins
in
his
body
he
knew
the
mortal
errors
which
constitute
the
material
body
and
could
destroy
those
errors
but
at
the
time
when
jesus
felt
our
infirmities
he
had
not
conquered
all
the
beliefs
of
the
flesh
or
his
sense
of
terial
life
nor
had
he
risen
to
his
final
demonstration
of
spiritual
power
had
he
shared
the
sinful
beliefs
of
others
he
would
have
been
less
sensitive
to
those
beliefs
through
the
magnitude
of
his
human
life
he
demonstrated
the
divine
life
out
of
the
amplitude
of
his
pure
affection
he
fined
love
with
the
affluence
of
truth
he
vanquished
error
the
world
acknowledged
not
his
righteousness
seeing
it
not
but
earth
received
the
harmony
his
glorified
example
introduced
inspiration
of
sacrifice
who
is
ready
to
follow
his
teaching
and
example
all
must
sooner
or
later
plant
themselves
in
christ
the
true
idea
of
god
that
he
might
liberally
pour
his
treasures
into
empty
or
filled
human
storehouses
was
the
inspiration
of
intense
human
sacrifice
in
witness
of
his
divine
mission
he
presented
the
proof
that
life
truth
and
love
heal
the
sick
and
the
sinning
and
triumph
over
death
through
mind
not
matter
this
was
the
highest
proof
he
could
have
offered
of
divine
love
his
hearers
understood
neither
his
words
nor
his
works
they
would
not
accept
his
meek
interpretation
of
life
nor
follow
his
example
spiritual
friendship
his
earthly
cup
of
bitterness
was
drained
to
the
dregs
there
adhered
to
him
only
a
few
unpretentious
friends
whose
religion
was
something
more
than
a
name
it
was
so
vital
that
it
abled
them
to
understand
the
nazarene
and
to
share
the
glory
of
eternal
life
he
said
that
those
who
lowed
him
should
drink
of
his
cup
and
history
has
firmed
the
prediction
injustice
to
the
saviour
if
that
godlike
and
glorified
man
were
physically
on
earth
would
not
some
who
now
fess
to
love
him
reject
him
would
they
not
deny
him
even
the
rights
of
humanity
if
he
tained
any
other
sense
of
being
and
religion
than
theirs
the
advancing
century
from
a
deadened
sense
of
the
invisible
god
subjects
to
unchristian
comment
and
usage
the
idea
of
christian
healing
enjoined
by
jesus
but
this
does
not
affect
the
invincible
facts
perhaps
the
early
christian
era
did
jesus
no
more
injustice
than
the
later
centuries
have
bestowed
upon
the
healing
christ
and
spiritual
idea
of
being
now
that
the
gospel
of
healing
is
again
preached
by
the
wayside
does
not
the
pulpit
sometimes
scorn
it
but
that
curative
mission
which
presents
the
saviour
in
a
clearer
light
than
mere
words
can
possibly
do
can
not
be
left
out
of
christianity
although
it
is
again
ruled
out
of
the
synagogue
truth
immortal
idea
is
sweeping
down
the
centuries
gathering
beneath
its
wings
the
sick
and
sinning
my
weary
hope
tries
to
realize
that
happy
day
when
man
shall
recognize
the
science
of
christ
and
love
his
neighbor
as
himself
when
he
shall
realize
god
omnipotence
and
the
healing
power
of
the
divine
love
in
what
it
has
done
and
is
doing
for
mankind
the
promises
will
be
filled
the
time
for
the
reappearing
of
the
divine
healing
is
throughout
all
time
and
whosoever
layeth
his
earthly
all
on
the
altar
of
divine
science
drinketh
of
cup
now
and
is
endued
with
the
spirit
and
power
of
christian
healing
in
the
words
of
john
he
shall
give
you
another
comforter
that
he
may
abide

let

they
neither

came

john

temporal
marriage
is
the
legal

moral
provision
for

among
human
kind
until
the
spiritual
creation
is
discerned
intact
is
apprehended

and
his

is
come

in
the
vision
of
the
apocalypse
where
the
corporeal
sense
of

was
cast
out
and
its

marriage

the

no

the

is
the

these

therefore

uproot

this
severance
of

serves
to
unite

more

supports
the

the

on

suggestion
said
the

to

this

matrimony

there

but
the

shows
that
the
sacredness

is
losing
its
influence

that
fatal

separation

christian

furnishes
no

mitigates
it
in

still
it
is
a
marvel
why

either

hope
it

a

means

at

the
elevation
of

the
achievement

if
a

deserts
his

certainly
the

to
collect
her

free

want

is
a
crying
evil
caused
by
the
selfishness
and
inhumanity
of
man
our
forefathers
exercised
their
faith
in
the
direction
taught
by
the
apostle
james
when
he
said
pure
religion
and
undefiled
before
god
and
the
father
is
this
to
visit
the
fatherless
and
widows
in
their
affliction
and
to
keep
himself
unspotted
from
the
world
benevolence
hindered
pride
envy
or
jealousy
seems
on
most
occasions
to
be
the
master
of
ceremonies
ruling
out
primitive
tianity
when
a
man
lends
a
helping
hand
to
some
noble
woman
struggling
alone
with
adversity
his

should
not

it

never

the

never

believed
in

she
was

a

ter
was

and
a

cured
her
i
have
named
her

to
individuals
when

and
it
may

i
discredit
the

that
agamogenesis
applies

human
species
god
creation
intact
christian
science
presents
unfoldment
not
accretion
it
manifests
no
material
growth
from

to
mind
but
an
impartation
of
the
divine
mind
to
man
and
the
universe
proportionately
as
human
generation
ceases
the
unbroken
links
of
eternal
monious
being
will
be
spiritually
discerned
and
man
not
of
the
earth
earthly
but
coexistent
with
god
will
appear
the
scientific
fact
that
man
and
the
universe
are
evolved
from
spirit
and
so
are
spiritual
is
as
fixed
in
divine
science
as
is
the
proof
that
mortals
gain
the
sense
of
health
only
as
they
lose
the
sense
of
sin
and
disease
mortals
can
never
understand
god
creation
while
ing
that
man
is
a
creator
god
children
already
created
will
be
cognized
only
as
man
finds
the
truth
of

thus
it
is
that
the
real
ideal
man
appears
in
proportion
as
the
false
and
material
disappears
no
longer
to
marry
or
to
be
given
in
marriage
neither
closes

tinuity
nor
his
sense
of
increasing

in
god
finite
plan
spiritually
to
understand
that
there
is
but
one

god

all

confirms
the

brings
the
sweet
assurance
of
no
parting
no
pain
and
of
man
deathless
and
perfect
and
eternal
if
christian
scientists
educate
their
own
offspring
spiritually
they
can
educate
others
spiritually
and
not
conflict
with
the
scientific
sense
of
god
creation
some
day
the
child
will
ask
his
parent
do
you
keep
the
first
commandment
do
you
have
one
god
and
creator
or
is
man
a
creator
if
the
father
replies
god
creates
man
through
man
the
child
may
ask
do
you
teach
that
spirit
creates
materially
or
do
you
declare
that
spirit
is
infinite
therefore
matter
is
out
of
the
tion
jesus
said
the
children
of
this

marry
and
are

but
they
which
shall

neither

when
they

that

verily

unto

if
a

then
said
the
jews
unto
him
now
we
know
that
thou
hast
a
devil
john
the
infinite
one
spirit
mortal
existence
is
an
enigma
every
day
is
a
mystery
the
testimony
of
the
corporeal
senses
can
not
inform
us
what
is
real
and
what
is
delusive
but
the
revelations
of
christian
science
unlock
the
treasures
of
truth
whatever
is
false
or
sinful
can
never
enter
the
atmosphere
of
spirit
there
is
but
one
spirit
man
is
never
god
but
spiritual
man
made
in
god
likeness
reflects
god
in
this
scientific
reflection
the
ego
and
the
father
are
inseparable
the
supposition
that
corporeal
beings
are
spirits
or
that
there
are
good
and
evil
spirits
is
a
mistake
real
and
unreal
identity
the
divine
mind
maintains
all
identities
from
a
blade
of
grass
to
a
star
as
distinct
and
eternal
the
questions
are
what
are
god
identities
what
is
soul
does
life
or
soul
exist
in
the
thing
formed
nothing
is
real
and
eternal
nothing
is
spirit
but
god
and
his
idea
evil
has
no
reality
it
is
neither
person
place
nor
thing
but
is
simply
a
belief
an
illusion
of
material
sense
the
identity
or
idea
of
all
reality
continues
forever
but
spirit
or
the
divine
principle
of
all
is
not
formations
soul
is
synonymous
with
spirit
god
the
creative
governing
infinite
principle
outside
of
finite
form
which
forms
only
reflect
close
your
eyes
and
you
may
dream
that
you
see
a
flower
that
you
touch
and
smell
it
thus
you
learn
that
the
flower
is
a
product
of
the
mind
a
formation
of
thought
rather
than
of
matter
close
your
eyes
again
and
you
may
see
scapes
men
and
women
thus
you
learn
that
these
also
are
images
which
mortal
mind
holds
and
evolves
and
which
simulate
mind
life
and
intelligence
from
dreams
also
you
learn
that
neither
mortal
mind
nor
matter
is
the
image
or
likeness
of
god
and
that
mortal
mind
is
not
in
matter
found
wanting
when
the
science
of
mind
is
understood
spiritualism
will
be
found
mainly
erroneous
having
no
scientific
basis
nor
origin
no
proof
nor
power
outside
of
human
testimony
it
is
the
offspring
of
the
physical
senses
there
is
no
sensuality
in
spirit
i
never
could
believe
in
spiritualism
the
basis
and
structure
of
spiritualism
are
alike
terial
and
physical
its
spirits
are
so
many
corporealities
limited
and
finite
in
character
and
quality
spiritualism
therefore
presupposes
spirit
which
is
ever
infinite
to
be
a
corporeal
being
a
finite
form
a
theory
contrary
to
christian
science
there
is
but
one
spiritual
existence
the
life
of
which
corporeal
sense
can
take
no
cognizance
the
divine
principle
of
man
speaks
through
immortal
sense
if
a
material
body
in
other
words
mortal
material
sense
were
permeated
by
spirit
that
body
would
disappear
to
mortal
sense
would
be
deathless
a
dition
precedent
to
communion
with
spirit
is
the
gain
of
spiritual
life
spirits
obsolete
are
but
corporeal
communicators
as
light
destroys
darkness
and
in
the
place
of
darkness
all
is
light
so
in
absolute
science
soul
or
god
is
the
only
to
man
truth
stroys
mortality
and
brings
to
light
immortality
mortal
belief
the
material
sense
of
life
and
immortal
truth
the
spiritual
sense
are
the
tares
and
the
wheat
which
are
not
united
by
progress
but
separated
perfection
is
not
expressed
through
imperfection
spirit
is
not
made
manifest
through
matter
the
pode
of
spirit
error
is
not
a
convenient
sieve
through
which
truth
can
be
strained
scientific
phenomena
god
good
being
ever
present
it
follows
in
divine
logic
that
evil
the
suppositional
opposite
of
good
is
never
present
in
science
individual
good
derived
from
god
the
infinite
may
flow
from
the
departed
to
mortals
but
evil
is
neither
municable
nor
scientific
a
sinning
earthly
mortal
is
not
the
reality
of
life
nor
the
medium
through
which
truth
passes
to
earth
the
joy
of
intercourse
becomes
the
jest
of
sin
when
evil
and
suffering
are
communicable
not
personal
intercommunion
but
divine
law
is
the
municator
of
truth
health
and
harmony
to
earth
and
humanity
as
readily
can
you
mingle
fire
and
frost
as
spirit
and
matter
in
either
case
one
does
not
support
the
other
spiritualism
calls
one
person
living
in
this
world
but
another
who
has
died
a
sinner
and
posedly
will
return
to
earth
it
terms
a
the
fact
is
that
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
is
infinite
spirit
for
spirit
is
god
and
man
is
his
likeness
one
government
the
belief
that
one
man
as
spirit
can
control
other
man
as
matter
upsets
both
the
individuality
and
the
science
of
man
for
man
is
image
god
controls
man
and
god
is
the
only
spirit
any
other
control
or
attraction
of
spirit
is
a
mortal
belief
which
ought
to
be
known
by
its
fruit
the
tition
of
evil
if
spirit
or
god
communed
with
mortals
or
controlled
them
through
electricity
or
any
other
form
of
matter
the
divine
order
and
the
science
of
omnipotent
omnipresent
spirit
would
be
destroyed
incorrect
theories
the
belief
that
material
bodies
return
to
dust
hereafter
to
rise
up
as
spiritual
bodies
with
material
sensations
and
desires
is
incorrect
equally
incorrect
is
the
belief
that
spirit
is
confined
in
a
finite
terial
body
from
which
it
is
freed
by
death
and
that
when
it
is
freed
from
the
material
body
spirit
retains
the
tions
belonging
to
that
body
no
it
is
a
grave
mistake
to
suppose
that
matter
is
any
part
of
the
reality
of
intelligent
existence
or
that
spirit

this
error
science

destroy
the
sensual
can
not
be
made
the
mouthpiece
of
the

nor
can
the
finite
become
the
channel
of
the
infinite
there
is
no
communication
between
called
material
existence
and
spiritual
life
which
is
not
subject
to
death
opposing
conditions
to
be
on
communicable
terms
with

persons
must
be
free
from
organic
bodies
and
their
return
to
a
rial
condition
after
having
once
left
it
would
be
as
impossible
as
would
be
the
restoration
to
its
original

of
the

the

the

no

and
manhood
sickness
and
health
are
opposites
different
beliefs
which
never
blend
who
will
say
that
infancy
can
utter
the
ideas
of
manhood
that
darkness
can
represent
light
that
we
are
in
europe
when
we
are
in
the
opposite
sphere
there
is
no
bridge
across
the
gulf
which
divides
two
such
opposite
conditions
as
the
spiritual
or
poreal
and
the
physical
or
corporeal
in
christian
science
there
is
never
a
retrograde
step
never
a
return
to
positions
outgrown
the
dead
and
living
can
not
commune
together
for
they
are
in
separate
states
of
existence
or
consciousness
unscientific
investiture
this
simple
truth
lays
bare
the
mistaken
assumption
that
man
dies
as
matter
but
comes
to
life
as
spirit
the
dead
in
order
to
reappear
to
those
still
in
the
existence
cognized
by
the
physical
senses
would
need
to
be
tangible
and
material
to
have
a
material
investiture
or
the
material
senses
could
take
no
cognizance
of
the
dead
spiritualism
would
transfer
men
from
the
spiritual
sense
of
existence
back
into
its
material
sense
this
gross
rialism
is
scientifically
impossible
since
to
infinite
spirit
there
can
be
no
matter
raising
the
dead
jesus
said
of
lazarus
our
friend
lazarus
sleepeth
but
i
go
that
i
may
awake
him
out
of
sleep
jesus
restored
lazarus
by
the
understanding
that
lazarus
had
never
died
not
by
an
sion
that
his
body
had
died
and
then
lived
again
had
jesus
believed
that
lazarus
had
lived
or
died
in
his
body
the
master
would
have
stood
on
the
same
plane
of
belief
as
those
who
buried
the
body
and
he
could
not
have
resuscitated
it
when
you
can
waken
yourself
or
others
out
of
the
belief
that
all
must
die
you
can
then
exercise
jesus
spiritual
power
to
reproduce
the
presence
of
those
who
have
thought
they
died
but
not
otherwise
vision
of
the
dying
there
is
one
possible
moment
when
those
living
on
the
earth
and
those
called
dead
can
commune
together
and
that
is
the
moment
previous
to
the
transition
the
moment
when
the
link
between
their
posite
beliefs
is
being
sundered
in
the
vestibule
through
which
we
pass
from
one
dream
to
another
dream
or
when
we
awake
from
earth
sleep
to
the
grand
verities
of
life
the
departing
may
hear
the
glad
welcome
of
those
who
have
gone
before
the
ones
departing
may
whisper
this
vision
name
the
face
that
smiles
on
them
and
the
hand
which
beckons
them
as
one
at
niagara
with
eyes
open
only
to
that
wonder
forgets
all
else
and
breathes
aloud
his
rapture
real
life
is
god
when
being
is
understood
life
will
be
recognized
as
neither
material
nor
finite
but
as
infinite
as
god
universal
good
and
the
belief
that
life
or
mind
was
ever
in
a
finite
form
or
good
in
evil
will
be
destroyed
then
it
will
be
understood
that
spirit
never
entered
matter
and
was
therefore
never
raised
from
matter
when
advanced
to
spiritual
being
and
the
understanding
of
god
man
can
no
longer
mune
with
matter
neither
can
he
return
to
it
any
more
than
a
tree
can
return
to
its
seed
neither
will
man
seem
to
be
corporeal
but
he
will
be
an
individual
ness
characterized
by
the
divine
spirit
as
idea
not
matter
suffering
sinning
dying
beliefs
are
unreal
when
divine
science
is
universally
understood
they
will
have
no
power
over
man
for
man
is
immortal
and
lives
by
divine
authority
immaterial
pleasure
the
sinless
joy
the
perfect
harmony
and
immortality
of
life
possessing
unlimited
divine
beauty
and
goodness
without
a
single
bodily
pleasure
or
pain
constitutes
the
only
veritable
indestructible
man
whose
being
is
spiritual
this
state
of
existence
is
scientific
and
intact
a
perfection
discernible
only
by
those
who
have
the
final
understanding
of
christ
in
divine
science
death
can
never
hasten
this
state
of
existence
for
death
must
be
overcome
not
submitted
to
before
immortality
appears
the
recognition
of
spirit
and
of
infinity
comes
not
suddenly
here
or
hereafter
the
pious
polycarp
said
i
can
not
turn
at
once
from
good
to
evil
neither
do
other
mortals
accomplish
the
change
from
error
to
truth
at
a
single
bound
second
death
existence
continues
to
be
a
belief
of
corporeal
sense
until
the
science
of
being
is
reached
error
brings
its
own
both
here
and
hereafter
for
mortal
mind
creates
its
own
physical
ditions
death
will
occur
on
the
next
plane
of
existence
as
on
this
until
the
spiritual
understanding
of
life
is
reached
then
and
not
until
then
will
it
be
strated
that
the
second
death
hath
no
power
a
dream
vanishing
the
period
required
for
this
dream
of
material
life
embracing
its
pleasures
and
pains
to
vanish
from
consciousness
knoweth
no
man
neither
the
son
but
the
father
this
period
will
be
of
longer
or
shorter
duration
according
to
the
tenacity
of
error
of
what
advantage
then
would
it
be
to
us
or
to
the
departed
to
prolong
the
material
state
and
so
prolong
the
illusion
either
of
a
soul
inert
or
of
a
sinning
suffering
sense
a
mind
fettered
to
matter
progress
and
purgatory
even
if
communications
from
spirits
to
mortal
sciousness
were
possible
such
communications
would
grow
beautifully
less
with
every
advanced
stage
of
existence
the
departed
would
gradually
rise
above
ignorance
and
materiality
and
spiritualists
would
outgrow
their
beliefs
in
material
spiritualism
spiritism
consigns
the
dead
to
a
state
resembling
that
of
blighted
buds
to
a
wretched
purgatory
where
the
chances
of
the
departed
for
improvement
narrow
into
nothing
and
they
return
to
their
old
standpoints
of
matter
unnatural
deflections
the
decaying
flower
the
blighted
bud
the
gnarled
oak
the
ferocious
beast
like
the
discords
of
disease
sin
and
death
are
unnatural
they
are
the
sities
of
sense
the
changing
deflections
of
tal
mind
they
are
not
the
eternal
realities
of
mind
absurd
oracles
how
unreasonable
is
the
belief
that
we
are
wearing
out
life
and
hastening
to
death
and
that
at
the
same
time
we
are
communing
with
immortality
if
the
departed
are
in
rapport
with
tality
or
matter
they
are
not
spiritual
but
must
still
be
mortal
sinning
suffering
and
dying
then
why
look
to
them
even
were
communication
possible
for
proofs
of
immortality
and
accept
them
as
oracles
munications
gathered
from
ignorance
are
pernicious
in
tendency
spiritualism
with
its
material
accompaniments
would
destroy
the
supremacy
of
spirit
if
spirit
pervades
all
space
it
needs
no
material
method
for
the
transmission
of
messages
spirit
needs
no

electricity
in

intangible
spirit

how
then
can
it

through

how
can
the

omnipotence
of

be
lost
god
is
not

the
medley
where

the

warning

against

an
error
that

must
go
over
the
whole

and
dig
up

of

christian

removes

the

the

objects
to

this
contending
for

a

there

there
never

the

repeats

the

mysticism
unscientific
i
entertain
no
doubt
of
the
humanity
and
philanthropy
of
many
spiritualists
but
i
can
not
coincide
with
their
views
it
is
mysticism
which
gives
ism
its
force
science
dispels
mystery
and
explains
extraordinary
phenomena
but
science
never
removes
phenomena
from
the
domain
of
reason
into
the
realm
of
mysticism
physical
falsities
it
should
not
seem
mysterious
that
mind
without
the

it

which
convulses

these

arise
from
the
volition
of

they
are
neither

nor
rational
mortal
mind

as
certainly
as

believes
that
this
wonder
emanates
from
spirits
and
tricity
this
belief
rests
on
the
common
conviction
that
mind
and
matter
cooperate
both
visibly
and
invisibly
hence
that
matter
is
intelligent
poor
evidence
there
is
not
so
much
evidence
to
prove
cation
between
the

the

there
is
to
show
the

that

yet
this
latter
evidence
is
destroyed
by
the
if
spiritualists
understood
the
science
of
being
their
belief
in
mediumship
would
vanish
no
proof
of
immortality
at
the
very
best
and
on
its
own
theories
spiritualism
can
only
prove
that
certain
individuals
have
a
continued
existence
after
death
and
maintain
their
ation
with
mortal
flesh
but
this
fact
affords
no
certainty
of

a

assertion
that

no
more
proves
him
to
be
so
than
the

would

the

in
the

as
truly
as
in

reading
thoughts
that
somebody
somewhere
must
have

the
deceased
person
supposed

evident
and
it

as
easy
to
read
distant

as
near
we
think
of
an

as
easily
as
we
do
of

it
is
no
more
difficult
to
read
the

than
it
is
to
read
the
present

wrote
centuries
ago
yet
we
still
read
his
thought
in
his
verse
what
is
classic
study
but
discernment
of
the
minds
of
homer
and
virgil
of
whose
personal
ence
we
may
be
in
doubt
impossible
intercommunion
if
spiritual
life
has
been
won
by
the
departed
they
can
not
return
to
material
existence
because
different
states
of
consciousness
are
involved
and
one
person
can
not
exist
in
two
different
states
of
consciousness
at
the
same
time
in
sleep
we
do
not
communicate
with
the
dreamer
by
our
side
despite
his
physical
proximity
because
both
of
us
are
either
conscious
or
are
wandering
in
our
dreams
through
ent
mazes
of
consciousness
in
like
manner
it
would
follow
even
if
our
departed
friends
were
near
us
and
were
in
as
conscious
a
state
of
existence
as
before
the
change
we
call
death
that
their
state
of
consciousness
must
be
different
from
ours
we
are
not
in
their
state
nor
are
they
in
the
mental
realm
in
which
we
dwell
communion
between
them
and
ourselves
would
be
prevented
by
this
difference
the
mental
states
are
so
unlike
that
intercommunion
is
as
impossible
as
it
would
be
between
a
mole
and
a
human
being
different
dreams
and
different
awakenings
token
a
differing
consciousness
when
wandering
in
australia
do
we
look
for
help
to
the
esquimaux
in
their
snow
huts
in
a
world
of
sin
and
sensuality
hastening
to
a
greater
development
of
power
it
is
wise
earnestly
to
consider
whether
it
is
the
human
mind
or
the
divine
mind
which
is
influencing
one
what
the
prophets
of
jehovah
did
the
worshippers
of
baal
failed
to
do
yet
artifice
and
delusion
claimed
that
they
could
equal
the
work
of
wisdom
science
only
can
explain
the
incredible
good
and
evil
elements
now
coming
to
the
surface
mortals
must
find
refuge
in
truth
in
order
to
escape
the
error
of
these
latter
days
nothing
is
more
antagonistic
to
christian
science
than
a
blind
belief
without
understanding
for
such
a
belief
hides
truth
and
builds
on
error
natural
wonders
miracles
are
impossible
in
science
and
here
science
takes
issue
with
popular
religions
the
scientific
festation
of
power
is
from
the
divine
nature
and
is
not
supernatural
since
science
is
an
explication
of
nature
the
belief
that
the
universe
cluding
man
is
governed
in
general
by
material
laws
but
that
occasionally
spirit
sets
aside
these
laws
this
lief
belittles
omnipotent
wisdom
and
gives
to
matter
the
precedence
over
spirit
conflicting
standpoints
it
is
contrary
to
christian
science
to
suppose
that
life
is
either
material
or
organically
spiritual
between
christian
science
and
all
forms
of
superstition
a
great
gulf
is
fixed
as
impassable
as
that
tween
dives
and
lazarus
there
is
mortal
and
immortal
the
latter
is
a
revelation
of
divine
purpose
through
spiritual
understanding
by
which
man
gains
the
divine
principle
and
explanation
of
all
things
mortal
and
immortal
reading
are
distinctly
opposite
standpoints
from
which
cause
and
effect
are
interpreted
the
act
of
reading
mortal
mind
investigates
and
touches
only
human
beliefs
science
is
immortal
and
coordinate
neither
with
the
premises
nor
with
the
conclusions
of
mortal
beliefs
scientific
foreseeing
the
ancient
prophets
gained
their
foresight
from
a
spiritual
incorporeal
standpoint
not
by
foreshadowing
evil
and
mistaking
fact
for
fiction
ing
the
future
from
a
groundwork
of
reality
and
human
belief
when
sufficiently
advanced
in
science
to
be
in
harmony
with
the
truth
of
being
men
become
seers
and
prophets
involuntarily
controlled
not
by
demons
spirits
or
demigods
but
by
the
one
spirit
it
is
the
prerogative
of
the
divine
mind
and
of
thought
which
is
in
rapport
with
this
mind
to
know
the
past
the
present
and
the
future
acquaintance
with
the
science
of
being
enables
us
to
commune
more
largely
with
the
divine
mind
to
foresee
and
foretell
events
which
concern
the
universal
welfare
to
be
divinely
inspired
yea
to
reach
the
range
of
less
mind
the
mind
unbounded
to
understand
that
mind
is
infinite
not
bounded
by
corporeality
not
dependent
upon
the
ear
and
eye
for
sound
or
sight
nor
upon
muscles
and
bones
for
locomotion
is
a
step
towards
the
science
by
which
we
discern
man
nature
and
existence
this
true
conception
of
being
destroys
the
belief
of
ualism
at
its
very
inception
for
without
the
concession
of
material
personalities
called
spirits
spiritualism
has
no
basis
upon
which
to
build
scientific
foreknowing
all
we
correctly
know
of
spirit
comes
from
god
divine
principle
and
is
learned
through
christ
and
christian
science
if
this
science
has
been
thoroughly
learned
and
properly
digested
we
can
know
the
truth
more
accurately
than
the
astronomer
can
read
the
stars
or
calculate
an
eclipse
this
is
the
opposite
of
clairvoyance
it
is
the
illumination
of
the
spiritual
understanding
which
demonstrates
the
pacity
of
soul
not
of
material
sense
this
comes
to
the
human
mind
when
the
latter
yields
to
the
divine
mind
value
of
intuition
such
intuitions
reveal
whatever
constitutes
and
petuates
harmony
enabling
one
to
do
good
but
not
evil
you
will
reach
the
perfect
science
of
healing
when
you
are
able
to
read
the
human
mind
after
this
manner
and
discern
the
error
you
would
destroy
the
samaritan
woman
said
come
see
a
man
which
told
me
all
things
that
ever
i
did
is
not
this
the
christ
it
is
recorded
that
jesus
as
he
once
journeyed
with
his
students
knew
their
thoughts
read
them
cally
in
like
manner
he
discerned
disease
and
healed
the
sick
after
the
same
method
events
of
great
ment
were
foretold
by
the
hebrew
prophets
our
master
rebuked
the
lack
of
this
power
when
he
said
o
ye
hypocrites
ye
can
discern
the
face
of
the
sky
but
can
ye
not
discern
the
signs
of
the
times
hypocrisy
condemned
both
jew
and
gentile
may
have
had
acute
corporeal
senses
but
mortals
need
spiritual
sense
jesus
knew
the
generation
to
be
wicked
and
adulterous
ing
the
material
more
than
the
spiritual
his
thrusts
at
materialism
were
sharp
but
needed
he
never
spared
hypocrisy
the
sternest
he
said
these
ought
ye
to
have
done
and
not
to
leave
the
other
undone
the
great
teacher
knew
both
cause
and
effect
knew
that
truth
communicates
itself
but
never
imparts
error
mental
contact
jesus
once
asked
who
touched
me
supposing
this
inquiry
to
be
occasioned
by
physical
contact
alone
his
disciples
answered
the
multitude
throng
thee
jesus
knew
as
others
did
not
that
it
was
not
matter
but
mortal
mind
whose
touch
called
for
aid
repeating
his
inquiry
he
was
answered
by
the
faith
of
a
sick
woman
his
quick
apprehension
of
this
mental
call
illustrated
his
spirituality
the
misconception
of
it
uncovered
their
materiality
jesus
possessed
more
spiritual
susceptibility
than
the
disciples
opposites
come
from
contrary
directions
and
produce
unlike
results
images
of
thought
mortals
evolve
images
of
thought
these
may
appear
to
the
ignorant
to
be
apparitions
but
they
are
rious
only
because
it
is
unusual
to
see
thoughts
though
we
can
always
feel
their
influence
haunted
houses
ghostly
voices
unusual
noises
and
apparitions
brought
out
in
dark
seances
either
involve
feats
by
tricksters
or
they
are
images
and
sounds
evolved
involuntarily
by
mortal
mind
seeing
is
no
less
a
quality
of
physical
sense
than
feeling
then
why
is
it
more
difficult
to
see
a
thought
than
to
feel
one
education
alone
determines
the
difference
in
reality
there
is
none
phenomena

portraits

recollected
sentences
can
all
be
taken
from
pictorial
thought
and
memory
as
readily
as
from
objects
cognizable
by
the

mortal
mind
sees
what
it
believes
as
certainly
as
it
believes
what
it
sees
it
feels
hears
and
sees
its
own

pictures
are
mentally
formed
before
the
artist
can
convey
them
to
canvas
so
is
it
with
all
material
conceptions
perceive
these
pictures
of
thought
they
copy
or
reproduce
them
even
when
they
are
lost
to
the
memory
of
the
mind
in
which
they
are
discoverable
mental
environment
it
is
needless
for
the
thought
or
for
the
person
ing
the
transferred
picture
to
be
individually
and
sciously
present
though
individuals
have
passed
away
their
mental
environment
mains
to
be
discerned
described
and
transmitted
though
bodies
are

apart
and
their

forgotten
their

of

the

such
vision
second
sight
when
really
it
is
first
sight
instead
of
second
for
it
presents
primal
facts
to
mortal
mind
science
enables
one
to
read
the
human
mind
but
not
as
a
clairvoyant
it
enables
one
to
heal
through
mind
but
not
as
a
mesmerist
buried
secrets
the
mine
knows
naught
of
the
emeralds
within
its
rocks
the
sea
is
ignorant
of
the
gems
within
its
caverns
of
the
corals
of
its
sharp
reefs
of
the
tall
ships
that
float
on
its
bosom
or
of
the
bodies
which
lie
buried
in
its
sands
yet
these
are
all
there
do
not
suppose
that
any
mental
concept
is
gone
because
you
do
not
think
of
it
the
true
concept
is
never
lost
the
strong
impressions
produced
on
mortal
mind
by
ship
or
by
any
intense
feeling
are
lasting
and
readers
can
perceive
and
reproduce
these
impressions
recollected
friends

may

we
have
but
to
close
the
eyes
and
forms
rise
before
us
which
are
thousands
of
miles
away
or
altogether
gone
from
physical
sight
and
sense
and
this
not
in
dreamy
sleep
in
our
we
can
recall
that
for
which
the
poet
tennyson
expressed
the
heart
desire
the
touch
of
a
vanished
hand
and
the
sound
of
a
voice
that
is
still
the
mind
may
even
be
cognizant
of
a
present
flavor
and
odor
when
no
viand
touches
the
palate
and
no
scent
salutes
the
nostrils
illusions
not
ideas
how
are
veritable
ideas
to
be
distinguished
from
lusions
by
learning
the
origin
of
each
ideas
are
emanations
from
the
divine
mind
thoughts
proceeding
from
the
brain
or
from
matter
are
offshoots
of
mortal
mind
they
are
mortal
material
liefs
ideas
are
spiritual
harmonious
and
eternal
beliefs
proceed
from
the
material
senses
which
at
one
time
are
supposed
to
be
and
at
another
are
called
spirits
to
love
one
neighbor
as
one
self
is
a
divine
idea
but
this
idea
can
never
be
seen
felt
nor
understood
through
the
physical
senses
excite
the
organ
of
eration
or
religious
faith
and
the
individual
manifests
profound
adoration
excite
the
opposite
development
and
he
blasphemes
these
effects
however
do
not
ceed
from
christianity
nor
are
they
spiritual
phenomena
for
both
arise
from
mortal
belief
trance
speaking
illusion
eloquence
the
strains
of
truth
and
love
it
is
due
to
inspiration
rather
than
to
erudition
it
shows
the
possibilities
derived
from
divine
mind
though
it
is
said
to
be
a
gift
whose
endowment
is
obtained
from
books
or
received
from
the
impulsion
of
departed
spirits
when
eloquence
proceeds
from
the
belief
that
a
departed
spirit
is
speaking
who
can
tell
what
the
unaided
medium
is
incapable
of
ing
or
uttering
this
phenomenon
only
shows
that
the
beliefs
of
mortal
mind
are
loosed
forgetting
her
rance
in
the
belief
that
another
mind
is
speaking
through
her
the
devotee
may
become
unwontedly
eloquent
ing
more
faith
in
others
than
in
herself
and
believing
that
somebody
else
possesses
her
tongue
and
mind
she
talks
freely
destroy
her
belief
in
outside
aid
and
her
eloquence
disappears
the
former
limits
of
her
belief
return
she
says
i
am
incapable
of
words
that
glow
for
i
am
educated
this
familiar
instance
reaffirms
the
tural
word
concerning
a
man
as
he
thinketh
in
his
heart
so
is
he
if
one
believes
that
he
can
not
be
an
orator
out
study
or
a
superinduced
condition
the
body
responds
to
this
belief
and
the
tongue
grows
mute
which
before
was
eloquent
scientific
improvisation
mind
is
not
necessarily
dependent
upon
educational
processes
it
possesses
of
itself
all
beauty
and
poetry
and
the
power
of
expressing
them
spirit
god
is
heard
when
the
senses
are
silent
we
are
all
capable
of
more
than
we
do
the
influence
or
action
of
soul
confers
a
freedom
which
explains
the
nomena
of
improvisation
and
the
fervor
of
untutored
lips
divine
origination
matter
is
neither
intelligent
nor
creative
the
tree
is
not
the
author
of
itself
sound
is
not
the
originator
of
music
and
man
is
not
the
father
of
man
cain
very
naturally
concluded
that
if
life
was
in
the
body
and
man
gave
it
man
had
the
right
to
take
it
away
this
incident
shows
that
the
belief
of
life
in
matter
was
a
murderer
from
the
beginning
if
seed
is
necessary
to
produce
wheat
and
wheat
to
produce
flour
or
if
one
animal
can
originate
another
how
then
can
we
account
for
their
primal
origin
how
were
the
loaves
and
fishes
multiplied
on
the
shores
of
galilee
and
that
too
without
meal
or
monad
from
which
loaf
or
fish
could
come
mind
is
substance
the
earth
orbit
and
the
imaginary
line
called
the
equator
are
not
substance
the
earth
motion
and
position
are
sustained
by
mind
alone
divest
yourself
of
the
thought
that
there
can
be
stance
in
matter
and
the
movements
and
transitions
now
possible
for
mortal
mind
will
be
found
to
be
equally
possible
for
the
body
then
being
will
be
recognized
as
spiritual
and
death
will
be
obsolete
though
now
some
insist
that
death
is
the
necessary
prelude
to
immortality
mortal
delusions
in
dreams
we
fly
to
europe
and
meet
a
friend
the
sees
the
body
in
bed
but
the
supposed
inhabitant
of
that
body
carries
it
through
the
air
and
over
the
ocean
this
shows
the
possibilities
of
thought
opium
and
hashish
eaters
tally
travel
far
and
work
wonders
yet
their
bodies
stay
in
one
place
this
shows
what
mortal
mentality
and
knowledge
are
scientific
finalities
the
admission
to
one
self
that
man
is
god
own
ness
sets
man
free
to
master
the
infinite
idea
this
viction
shuts
the
door
on
death
and
opens
it
wide
towards
immortality
the
understanding
and
recognition
of
spirit
must
finally
come
and
we
may
as
well
improve
our
time
in
solving
the
mysteries
of
being
through
an
apprehension
of
divine
principle
at
present
we
know
not
what
man
is
but
we
certainly
shall
know
this
when
man
reflects
god
the
revelator
tells
us
of
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
have
you
ever
pictured
this
heaven
and
earth
inhabited
by
beings
under
the
control
of
supreme
wisdom
let
us
rid
ourselves
of
the
belief
that
man
is
separated
from
god
and
obey
only
the
divine
principle
life
and
love
here
is
the
great
point
of
departure
for
all
true
spiritual
growth
man
genuine
being
it
is
difficult
for
the
sinner
to
accept
divine
science
because
science
exposes
his
nothingness
but
the
sooner
error
is
reduced
to
its
native
nothingness
the
sooner
man
great
reality
will
appear
and
his
genuine
being
will
be
understood
the
destruction
of
error
is
by
no
means
the
destruction
of
truth
or
life
but
is
the
acknowledgment
of
them
absorbed
in
material
selfhood
we
discern
and
reflect
but
faintly
the
substance
of
life
or
mind
the
denial
of
material
selfhood
aids
the
discernment
of
man
ual
and
eternal
individuality
and
destroys
the
erroneous
knowledge
gained
from
matter
or
through
what
are
termed
the
material
senses
erroneous
postulates
certain
erroneous
postulates
should
be
here
considered
in
order
that
the
spiritual
facts
may
be
better
apprehended
the
first
erroneous
postulate
of
belief
is
that
substance
life
and
intelligence
are
something
apart
from
god
the
second
erroneous
postulate
is
that
man
is
both
mental
and
material
the
third
erroneous
postulate
is
that
mind
is
both
evil
and
good
whereas
the
real
mind
can
not
be
evil
nor
the
medium
of
evil
for
mind
is
god
the
fourth
erroneous
postulate
is
that
matter
is
telligent
and
that
man
has
a
material
body
which
is
part
of
himself
the
fifth
erroneous
postulate
is
that
matter
holds
in
itself
the
issues
of
life
and
death
that
matter
is
not
only
capable
of
experiencing
pleasure
and
pain
but
also
capable
of
imparting
these
sensations
from
the
illusion
implied
in
this
last
postulate
arises
the
decomposition
of
mortal
bodies
in
what
is
termed
death
mind
is
not
an
entity
within
the
cranium
with
the
power
of
sinning
now
and
forever
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
in
old
scriptural
pictures
we
see
a
serpent
coiled
around
the
tree
of
knowledge
and
speaking
to
adam
and
eve
this
represents
the
serpent
in
the
act
of
commending
to
our
first
parents
the
edge
of
good
and
evil
a
knowledge
gained
from
matter
or
evil
instead
of
from
spirit
the
portrayal
is
still
graphically
accurate
for
the
common
conception
of
tal
man
a
burlesque
of
god
man
is
an
outgrowth
of
human
knowledge
or
sensuality
a
mere
offshoot
of
material
sense
opposing
power
uncover
error
and
it
turns
the
lie
upon
you
until
the
fact
concerning
error
namely
its
nothingness
appears
the
moral
demand
will
not
be
met
and
the
ability
to
make
nothing
of
error
will
be
wanting
we
should
blush
to
call
that
real
which
is
only
a
mistake
the
foundation
of
evil
is
laid
on
a
belief
in
something
besides
god
this
belief
tends
to
support
two
opposite
powers
instead
of
urging
the
claims
of
truth
alone
the
mistake
of
thinking
that
error
can
be
real
when
it
is
merely
the
absence
of
truth
leads
to
belief
in
the
superiority
of
error
the
age
privilege
do
you
say
the
time
has
not
yet
come
in
which
to
recognize
soul
as
substantial
and
able
to
control
the
body
remember
jesus
who
nearly
nineteen
centuries
ago
demonstrated
the
power
of
spirit
and
said
he
that
believeth
on
me
the
works
that
i
do
shall
he
do
also
and
who
also
said
but
the
hour
cometh
and
when
the
true
worshippers
shall
worship
the
father
in
spirit
and
in
truth
behold
is
the
accepted
time
behold
is
the
day
of
vation
said
paul
logic
and
revelation
divine
logic
and
revelation
coincide
if
we
believe
otherwise
we
may
be
sure
that
either
our
logic
is
at
fault
or
that
we
have
misinterpreted
revelation
good
never
causes
evil
nor
creates
aught
that
can
cause
evil
good
does
not
create
a
mind
susceptible
of
causing
evil
for
evil
is
the
opposing
error
and
not
the
truth
of
creation
destructive
electricity
is
not
the
offspring
of
finite
good
whatever
contradicts
the
real
nature
of
the
divine
though
human
faith
may
clothe
it
with
angelic
vestments
is
without
foundation
derivatives
of
spirit
the
belief
that
spirit
is
finite
as
well
as
infinite
has
darkened
all
history
in
christian
science
spirit
as
a
proper
noun
is
the
name
of
the
supreme
being
it
means
quantity
and
quality
and
applies
clusively
to
god
the
modifying
derivatives
of
the
word
refer
only
to
quality
not
to
god
man
is
spiritual
he
is
not
god
spirit
if
man
were
spirit
then
men
would
be
spirits
gods
finite
spirit
would
be
mortal
and
this
is
the
error
embodied
in
the
belief
that
the
nite
can
be
contained
in
the
finite
this
belief
tends
to
becloud
our
apprehension
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
and
of
the
reign
of
harmony
in
the
science
of
being
scientific
man
jesus
taught
but
one
god
one
spirit
who
makes
man
in
the
image
and
likeness
of
himself
of
spirit
not
of
matter
man
reflects
infinite
truth
life
and
love
the
nature
of
man
thus
understood
includes
all
that
is
implied
by
the
terms
image
and
likeness
as
used
in
scripture
the
truly
christian
and
scientific
statement
of
personality
and
of
the
relation
of
man
to
god
with
the
demonstration
which
nied
it
incensed
the
rabbis
and
they
said
crucify
him
crucify
him
by
our
law
he
ought
to
die
because
he
made
himself
the
son
of
god
the
eastern
empires
and
nations
owe
their
false
ernment
to
the
misconceptions
of
deity
there
prevalent
tyranny
intolerance
and
bloodshed
wherever
found
arise
from
the
belief
that
the

after
the
pattern
of
mortal
personality
passion
and
impulse
ingratitude
and
denial
the
progress
of
truth
confirms
its
claims
and
our
master
confirmed
his
words
by
his
works
his
power
evoked
denial
ingratitude
and
trayal
arising
from
sensuality
of
the
ten
lepers
whom
jesus
healed
but
one
returned
to
give
god
thanks
that
is
to
acknowledge
the
divine
principle
which
had
healed
him
spiritual
insight
our
master
easily
read
the
thoughts
of
mankind
and
this
insight
better
enabled
him
to
direct
those
thoughts
aright
but
what
would
be
said
at
this
period
of
an
fidel
blasphemer
who
should
hint
that
jesus
used
his
cisive
power
injuriously
our
master
read
mortal
mind
on
a
scientific
basis
that
of
the
omnipresence
of
mind
an
approximation
of
this
discernment
indicates
spiritual
growth
and
union
with
the
infinite
capacities
of
the
one
mind
jesus
could
injure
no
one
by
his
the
effect
of
his
mind
was
always
to
heal
and
to
save
and
this
is
the
only
genuine
science
of
reading
mortal
mind
his
holy
motives
and
aims
were
duced
by
the
sinners
of
that
period
as
they
would
be
if
jesus
were
personally
present
paul
said
to
be
spiritually
minded
is
life
we
approach
god
or
life
in
proportion
to
our
spirituality
our
ity
to
truth
and
love
and
in
that
ratio
we
know
all
human
need
and
are
able
to
discern
the
thought
of
the
sick
and
the
sinning
for
the
purpose
of
healing
them
error
of
any
kind
can
not
hide
from
the
law
of
god
whoever
reaches
this
point
of
moral
culture
and
ness
can
not
injure
others
and
must
do
them
good
the
greater
or
lesser
ability
of
a
christian
scientist
to
discern
thought
scientifically
depends
upon
his
genuine
uality
this
kind
of
is
not
clairvoyance
but
it
is
important
to
success
in
healing
and
is
one
of
the
special
characteristics
thereof
christ
reappearance
we
welcome
the
increase
of
knowledge
and
the
end
of
error
because
even
human
invention
must
have
its
day
and
we
want
that
day
to
be
succeeded
by
christian
science
by
divine
reality

it

is
what
the

none

the

christian

teaches
only

christian

is
unerring

jesus
earliest
investigations
mesmerism
or
animal
magnetism
was
first
brought
into
notice
by
mesmer
in
germany
in
cording
to
the
american
cyclopaedia
he
regarded
this
force
which
he
said
could
be
erted
by
one
living
organism
over
another
as
a
means
of
alleviating
disease
his
propositions
were
as
follows
there
exists
a
mutual
influence
between
the
celestial
bodies
the
earth
and
animated
things
animal
bodies
are
susceptible
to
the
influence
of
this
agent
ing
itself
through
the
substance
of
the
nerves
in
the
french
government
ordered
the
medical
faculty
of
paris
to
investigate
mesmer
theory
and
to
report
upon
it
under
this
order
a
commission
was
appointed
and
benjamin
franklin
was
one
of
the
missioners
this
commission
reported
to
the
ment
as
follows
in
regard
to
the
existence
and
utility
of
animal
netism
we
have
come
to
the
unanimous
conclusions
that
there
is
no
proof
of
the
existence
of
the
animal
magnetic
fluid
that
the
violent
effects
which
are
observed
in
the
public
practice
of
magnetism
are
due
to
tions
or
to
the
excitement
of
the
imagination
and
the
impressions
made
upon
the
senses
and
that
there
is
one
more
fact
to
be
recorded
in
the
history
of
the
errors
of
the
human
mind
and
an
important
experiment
upon
the
power
of
the
imagination
clairvoyance
magnetism
in
a
committee
of
nine
persons
was
appointed
among
whom
were
roux
bouillaud
and
quet
which
tested
during
several
sessions
the
phenomena
exhibited
by
a
reputed
clairvoyant
their
report
stated
the
results
as
follows
the
facts
which
had
been
promised
by
monsieur
berna
the
magnetizer
as
conclusive
and
as
adapted
to
throw
light
on
physiological
and
therapeutical
questions
are
certainly
not
conclusive
in
favor
of
the
doctrine
of
animal
magnetism
and
have
nothing
in
common
with
either
physiology
or
therapeutics
this
report
was
adopted
by
the
royal
academy
of
medicine
in
paris
personal
conclusions
the
author
own
observations
of
the
workings
of
animal
magnetism
convince
her
that
it
is
not
a
remedial
agent
and
that
its
effects
upon
those
who
practise
it
and
upon
their
subjects
who
do
not
resist
it
lead
to
moral
and
to
physical
death
if
animal
magnetism
seems
to
alleviate
or
to
cure
ease
this
appearance
is
deceptive
since
error
can
not
remove
the
effects
of
error
discomfort
under
error
is
preferable
to
comfort
in
no
instance
is
the
effect
of
animal
magnetism
recently
called
hypnotism
other
than
the
effect
of
illusion
any
seeming
benefit
derived
from
it
is
proportional
to
one
faith
in
esoteric
magic
mere
negation
animal
magnetism
has
no
scientific
foundation
for
god
governs
all
that
is
real
harmonious
and
eternal
and
his
power
is
neither
animal
nor
human
its
basis
being
a
belief
and
this
belief
animal
in
science
animal
magnetism
mesmerism
or
hypnotism
is
a
mere
negation
possessing
neither
intelligence
power
nor
reality
and
in
sense
it
is
an
unreal
concept
of
the
called
mortal
mind
there
is
but
one
real
attraction
that
of
spirit
the
pointing
of
the
needle
to
the
pole
symbolizes
this
embracing
power
or
the
attraction
of
god
divine
mind
the
planets
have
no
more
power
over
man
than
over
his
maker
since
god
governs
the
universe
but
man
reflecting
god
power
has
dominion
over
all
the
earth
and
its
hosts
hidden
agents
the
mild
forms
of
animal
magnetism
are
ing
and
its
aggressive
features
are
coming
to
the
front
the
looms
of
crime
hidden
in
the
dark
cesses
of
mortal
thought
are
every
hour
ing
webs
more
complicated
and
subtle
so
secret
are
the
present
methods
of
animal
magnetism
that
they
ensnare
the
age
into
indolence
and
produce
the
very
apathy
on
the
subject
which
the
criminal
desires
the
following
is
an
extract
from
the
boston
herald
mesmerism
is
a
problem
not
lending
itself
to
an
easy
explanation
and
development
it
implies
the
exercise
of
despotic
control
and
is
much
more
likely
to
be
abused
by
its
possessor
than
otherwise
employed
for
the
dividual
or
society
mental
despotism
mankind
must
learn
that
evil
is
not
power
its
called
despotism
is
but
a
phase
of
nothingness
christian
science
despoils
the
kingdom
of
evil
and
promotes
affection
and
virtue
in
families
and
therefore
in
the
community
the
apostle
paul
refers
to
the
personification
of
evil
as
the
god
of
this
world
and
further
defines
it
as
dishonesty
and
craftiness
sin
was
the
assyrian
liberation
of
mental
powers
the
destruction
of
the
claims
of
mortal
mind
through
science
by
which
man
can
escape
from
sin
and
mortality
blesses
the
whole
human
ily
as
in
the
beginning
however
this
tion
does
not
scientifically
show
itself
in
a
knowledge
of
both
good
and
evil
for
the
latter
is
unreal
on
the
other
hand
is
wholly
separate
from
any
impertinent
knowledge
because
science
is
of
god
and
demonstrates
the
divine
principle
working
out
the
purposes
of
good
only
the
maximum
of
good
is
the
infinite
god
and
his
idea
the
evil
is
a
suppositional
lie
the
genus
of
error
as
named
in
christian
science
animal
magnetism
or
hypnotism
is
the
specific
term
for
error
or
mortal
mind
it
is
the
false
belief
that
mind
is
in
matter
and
is
both
evil
and
good
that
evil
is
as
real
as
good
and
more
powerful
this
belief
has
not
one
ity
of
truth
it
is
either
ignorant
or
malicious
the
malicious
form
of
hypnotism
ultimates
in
moral
idiocy
the
truths
of
immortal
mind
sustain
man
and
they
hilate
the
fables
of
mortal
mind
whose
flimsy
and
gaudy
pretensions
like
silly
moths
singe
their
own
wings
and
fall
into
dust
in
reality
there
is
no
mind
and
quently
no
transference
of
mortal
thought
and
life
and
being
are
of
god
in
christian
science
man
can
do
no
harm
for
scientific
thoughts
are
true
thoughts
passing
from
god
to
man
when
christian
science
and
animal
magnetism
are
both
comprehended
as
they
will
be
at
no
distant
date
it
will
be
seen
why
the
author
of
this
book
has
been
so
unjustly
persecuted
and
belied
by
wolves
in
clothing
agassiz
the
celebrated
naturalist
and
author
has
wisely
said
every
great
scientific
truth
goes
through
three
stages
first
people
say
it
conflicts
with
the
bible
next
they
say
it
has
been
discovered
before
lastly
they
say
they
have
always
believed
it
perfection
of
divine
government
christian
science
goes
to
the
bottom
of
mental
action
and
reveals
the
theodicy
which
indicates
the
rightness
of
all
divine
action
as
the
emanation
of
divine
mind
and
the
consequent
wrongness
of
the
opposite
action
evil
occultism
necromancy
mesmerism
animal
magnetism
hypnotism
adulteration
of
truth
the
medicine
of
science
is
divine
mind
and
dishonesty
sensuality
falsehood
revenge
malice
are
animal
pensities
and
by
no
means
the
mental
ties
which
heal
the
sick
the
hypnotizer
employs
one
error
to
destroy
another
if
he
heals
ness
through
a
belief
and
a
belief
originally
caused
the
sickness
it
is
a
case
of
the
greater
error
overcoming
the
lesser
this
greater
error
thereafter
occupies
the
ground
leaving
the
case
worse
than
before
it
was
grasped
by
the
stronger
error
motives
considered
our
courts
recognize
evidence
to
prove
the
motive
as
well
as
the
commission
of
a
crime
is
it
not
clear
that
the
human
mind
must
move
the
body
to
a
wicked
act
is
not
mortal
mind
the
derer
the
hands
without
mortal
mind
to
direct
them
could
not
commit
a
murder
mental
crimes
courts
and
juries
judge
and
sentence
mortals
in
order
to
restrain
crime
to
prevent
deeds
of
violence
or
to
punish
them
to
say
that
these
tribunals
have
no
jurisdiction
over
the
carnal
or
mortal
mind
would
be
to
contradict
precedent
and
to
admit
that
the
power
of
human
law
is
restricted
to
matter
while
mortal
mind
evil
which
is
the
real
outlaw
defies
justice
and
is
recommended
to

can
matter

can

can
you
separate
the

from
the
body
over
which
courts
hold
jurisdiction
mortal
mind
not
matter
is
the
criminal
in
every
case
and
human
law
rightly
estimates
crime
and
courts
sonably
pass
sentence
according
to
the
motive
important
decision
when
our
laws
eventually
take
cognizance
of
mental
crime
and
no
longer
apply
legal
rulings
wholly
to
physical
offences
these
words
of
judge
parmenter
of
boston
will
become
historic
i
see
no
reason
why
metaphysics
is
not
as
important
to
medicine
as
to
mechanics
or
mathematics
evil
let
loose
whoever
uses
his
developed
mental
powers
like
an
caped
felon
to
commit
fresh
atrocities
as
opportunity
curs
is
never

god

arrest
him

manacle
him
his

will
be
millstones
about
his

weighing
him
down
to
the
depths
of
ignominy
and
death
the
aggravation
of
ror
foretells
its
doom
and
confirms
the
ancient
axiom
whom
the
gods
would
destroy
they
first
make
mad
the
misuse
of
mental
power
the
distance
from
ordinary
medical
tice
to
christian
science
is
full
many
a
league
in
the
line
of
light
but
to
go
in
healing
from
the
use
of
inanimate
drugs
to
the
criminal
misuse
of
human
power
is
to
drop
from
the
platform
of
common
manhood
into
the
very
mire
of
iniquity
to
work
against
the
free
course
of
honesty
and
justice
and
to
push
vainly
against
the
current
running
heavenward
proper
like
our
nation
christian
science
has
its
declaration
of
independence
god
has
endowed
man
with
able
rights
among
which
are
reason
and
conscience
man
is
properly
governed
only
when
he
is
guided
rightly
and
governed
by
his
maker
divine
truth
and
love
man
rights
are
invaded
when
the
divine
order
is
terfered
with
and
the
mental
trespasser
incurs
the
divine
penalty
due
this
crime
right
methods
let
this
age
which
sits
in
judgment
on
christian
science
sanction
only
such
methods
as
are
demonstrable
in
truth
and
known
by
their
fruit
and
classify
all
others
as
did
paul
in
his
great
epistle
to
the
galatians
when
he
wrote
as
follows
now
the
works
of
the
flesh
are
manifest
which
are
these
adultery
fornication
uncleanness
lasciviousness
idolatry
hatred
variance
emulations
wrath
strife
seditions
heresies
envyings
murders
drunkenness
revellings
and
such
like
of
the
which
i
tell
you
before
as
i
have
also
told
you
in
time
past
that
they
which
do
such
things
shall
not
inherit
the
kingdom
of
god
but
the
fruit
of
the
spirit
is
love
joy
peace
longsuffering
gentleness
goodness
faith
meekness
temperance
against
such
there
is
no
law
chapter
vi
science
theology
medicine
but
i
certify
you
brethren
that
the
gospel
which
was
preached
of
me
is
not
after
man
for
i
neither
received
it
of
man
neither
was
i
taught
it
but
by
the
revelation
of
jesus
christ
paul
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
like
unto
leaven
which
a
woman
took
and
hid
in
three
measures
of
meal
till
the
whole
was
leavened
jesus
christian
science
discovered
in
the
year
i
discovered
the
christ
science
or
divine
laws
of
life
truth
and
love
and
named
my
discovery
christian
science
god
had
been
graciously
preparing
me
during
many
years
for
the
reception
of
this
final
revelation
of
the
solute
divine
principle
of
scientific
mental
healing
mission
of
christian
science
this
apodictical
principle
points
to
the
revelation
of
immanuel
god
with
us
the
sovereign
ence
delivering
the
children
of
men
from
every
ill
that
flesh
is
heir
to
through
christian
science
religion
and
medicine
are
inspired
with
a
diviner
nature
and
essence
fresh
pinions
are
given
to
faith
and
understanding
and
thoughts
quaint
themselves
intelligently
with
god
discontent
with
life
feeling
so
perpetually
the
false
consciousness
that
life
inheres
in
the
body
yet
remembering
that
in
reality
god
is
our
life
we
may
well
tremble
in
the
prospect
of
those
days
in
which
we
must
say
i
have
no
pleasure
in
them
whence
came
to
me
this
heavenly
conviction
a
viction
antagonistic
to
the
testimony
of
the
physical
senses
according
to
paul
it
was
the
gift
of
the
grace
of
god
given
unto
me
by
the
effectual
working
of
his
power
it
was
the
divine
law
of
life
and
love
unfolding
to
me
the
demonstrable
fact
that
matter
possesses
neither
sation
nor
life
that
human
experiences
show
the
falsity
of
all
material
things
and
that
immortal
cravings
the
price
of
learning
love
establish
the
truism
that
the
only
sufferer
is
mortal
mind
for
the
divine
mind
can
not
suffer
demonstrable
evidence
my
conclusions
were
reached
by
allowing
the
evidence
of
this
revelation
to
multiply
with
mathematical
certainty
and
the
lesser
demonstration
to
prove
the
greater
as
the
product
of
three
multiplied
by
three
equalling
nine
proves
conclusively
that
three
times
three
duodecillions
must
be
nine
duodecillions
not
a
fraction
more
not
a
unit
less
light
shining
in
darkness
when
apparently
near
the
confines
of
mortal
existence
standing
already
within
the
shadow
of
the
i
learned
these
truths
in
divine
science
that
all
real
being
is
in
god
the
divine
mind
and
that
life
truth
and
love
are
and
present
that
the
opposite
of
truth
called
error
sin
sickness
disease
death
is
the
false
testimony
of
false
material
sense
of
mind
in
matter
that
this
false
sense
evolves
in
belief
a
subjective
state
of
mortal
mind
which
this
same
mind
names
thereby
shutting
out
the
true
sense
of
spirit
new
lines
of
thought
my
discovery
that
erring
mortal
misnamed
produces
all
the
organism
and
action
of
the
mortal
body
set
my
thoughts
to
work
in
new
channels
and
led
up
to
my
demonstration
of
the
proposition
that
mind
is
all
and
matter
is
naught
as
the
leading
factor
in
scientific
evidence
christian
science
reveals
incontrovertibly
that
mind
is
that
the
only
realities
are
the
divine
mind
and
idea
this
great
fact
is
not
however
seen
to
be
supported
by
sensible
evidence
until
its
divine
principle
is
demonstrated
by
healing
the
sick
and
thus
proved
absolute
and
divine
this
proof
once
seen
no
other
conclusion
can
be
reached
solitary
research
for
three
years
after
my
discovery
i
sought
the
tion
of
this
problem
of
searched
the
tures
and
read
little
else
kept
aloof
from
ciety
and
devoted
time
and
energies
to
covering
a
positive
rule
the
search
was
sweet
calm
and
buoyant
with
hope
not
selfish
nor
depressing
i
knew
the
principle
of
all
harmonious
to
be
god
and
that
cures
were
produced
in
primitive
christian
healing
by
holy
uplifting
faith
but
i
must
know
the
science
of
this
healing
and
i
won
my
way
to
absolute
conclusions
through
divine
revelation
reason
and
onstration
the
revelation
of
truth
in
the
ing
came
to
me
gradually
and
apparently
through
divine
power
when
a
new
spiritual
idea
is
borne
to
earth
the
prophetic
scripture
of
isaiah
is
renewedly
fulfilled
unto
us

child

born

his
name

be

my
doctrine
is
not
mine
but
his
that
sent
me
if
any
man
will
do
his
will
he
shall
know
of
the
doctrine
whether
it
be
of

or
whether
i

were

were
ciled
and
afterwards
the

was
demonstrated
no
human

taught
me
the

contained
in

neither

may
be
distorted
by

by

and
its
ideas
may
be

the
science

will
forever
remain
to
be

lost

jesus
demonstrated
the
power

to

the

is
no

than
is
the

of

rather
than
to

is
one
of
many
incidents
which
show
that
christian

meets
a
yearning
of
the
human
race
for
spirituality
confirmatory
tests
after
a
lengthy
examination
of
my
discovery
and
its
demonstration
in
healing
the
sick
this
fact
became
dent
to
me
that
mind
governs
the
body
not
partially
but
wholly
i
submitted
my
metaphysical
system
of
treating
disease
to
the
est
practical
tests
since
then
this
system
has
gradually
gained
ground
and
has
proved
itself
whenever
tifically
employed
to
be
the
most
effective
curative
agent
in
medical
practice
one
school
of
truth
is
there
more
than
one
school
of
christian
science
christian
science
is
demonstrable
there
can
fore
be
but
one
method
in
its
teaching
those
who
part
from
this
method
forfeit
their
claims
to
belong
to
its
school
and
they
become
ents
of
the
socratic
the
platonic
the
spencerian
or
some
other
school
by
this
is
meant
that
they
adopt
and
here
to
some
particular
system
of
human
opinions
though
these
opinions
may
have
occasional
gleams
of
divinity
borrowed
from
that
truly
divine
science
which
eschews
systems
they
nevertheless
remain
wholly
human
in
their
origin
and
tendency
and
are
not
scientifically
christian
unchanging
principle
from
the
infinite
one
in
christian
science
comes
one
principle
and
its
infinite
idea
and
with
this
infinitude
come
spiritual
rules
laws
and
their

which
like
the
great

are
the

yesterday
and
and
forever
for
thus
are
the
divine
principle
of

and
the
terized
in
the
epistle
to
the

on

any
theory
of
christian

which
departs
from
what
has
already
been
stated

proved
to

fords
no

upon
which
to
establish
a

school
of
this

also
if
any
new
school
claims
to
be
christian
science
and
yet
uses
another
author

without
giving
that

proper
credit
such
a

is
erroneous
for
it
inculcates
a
breach
of
that
divine
commandment
in
the
hebrew
decalogue
thou

god
is
the
principle

as
there
is

there

there

the

its

the

in

mind

including
noumenon
and
nomena
god
and
his

imperfect
terminology
mortal
mind
is
a
solecism
in
language
and
involves
an
improper
use
of
the
word
as
mind
is
immortal
the
phrase
implies
something
true
and
therefore
unreal
and
as
the
phrase
is
used
in
teaching
christian
science
it
is
meant
to
designate
that
which
has
no
real
existence
indeed
if
a
better
word
or
phrase
could
be
suggested
it
would
be
used
but
in
expressing
the
new
tongue
we
must
sometimes
recur
to
the
old
and
imperfect
and
the
new
wine
of
the
spirit
has
to
be
poured
into
the
old

of
the

christian

it

the

disentangles
the

ambiguities
of
being
and
sets
free
the
imprisoned
thought
in

the

shows
that
what

the
subjective

of
what

termed
by
the

philological
inadequacy
apart
from
the
usual
opposition
to
everything
new
the
one
great
obstacle
to
the
reception
of
that
ity
through
which
the
understanding
of
comes
is
the
inadequacy
of
material
terms
for
metaphysical
statements
and
the
consequent
difficulty
of
so
expressing
metaphysical
ideas
as
to
make
them
comprehensible

the

as
to
make
this
scriptural
testimony
true
in
our
hearts
the
last
shall
be
first
and
the
first
last
so
that
god
and
his
idea
may
be
to
us
what
divinity
really
is
and
must
of
necessity
be
aim
of
science
a
correct
view
of
christian
science
and
of
its
tion
to
healing
includes
vastly
more
than
is
at
first
seen
works
on
metaphysics
leave
the
grand
point
untouched
they
never
crown
the
power
of
mind
as
the
messiah
nor
do
they
carry
the
day
against
physical
enemies
even
to
the
extinction
of
all
belief
in
matter
evil
disease
and
death
nor
insist
upon
the
fact
that
god
is
all
therefore
that
matter
is
nothing
beyond
an
image
in
mortal
mind
divine
personality
christian
science
strongly
emphasizes
the
thought
that
god
is
not
but
that
is
bodiless
mortals
are
corporeal
but
god
is
incorporeal
as
the
words
and
are
commonly
and
ignorantly
employed
they
often
lead
when
applied
to
deity
to
confused
and
erroneous
conceptions
of
divinity
and
its
distinction
from
humanity
if
the
term
personality
as
applied
to
god
means
infinite
personality
then
god
is
infinite
in
the
sense
of
infinite
personality
but
not
in
the
lower
sense
an
infinite
mind
in
a
finite
form
is
an
absolute
impossibility
the
term
is
also
open
to
objections
cause
an
individual
may
be
one
of
a
series
one
of
many
as
an
individual
man
an
individual
horse
whereas
god
is
not
one
of
a
series
but
one
alone
and
without
an
equal
spiritual
language
god
is
spirit
therefore
the
language
of
spirit
must
be
and
is
spiritual
christian
science
attaches
no
cal
nature
and
significance
to
the
supreme
being
or
his
manifestation
mortals
alone
do
this
god
essential
language
is
spoken
of
in
the
last
chapter
of
mark

as
the
new
tongue
the
itual
meaning
of
which
is
attained
through

following
the
miracles
of
jesus
ear
hath
not
heard
nor
hath

spoken
the
pure
guage
of
spirit
our
master
taught
spirituality
by
tudes
and
parables
as
a
divine
student
he
unfolded
god
to
man
illustrating
and
strating
life
and
truth
in
himself
and
by
his
power
over
the
sick
and
sinning
human
theories
are
inadequate
to
interpret
the
divine
principle
involved
in
the
miracles
marvels
wrought
by
jesus
and
especially
in
his
mighty
crowning
unparalleled
and
triumphant
exit
from
the

opacity
of
the

evidence
drawn
from
the
five
physical

relates
solely
to
human
reason
and
because
of

to
the
true
light
human
reason
dimly
flects
and
feebly
transmits
jesus
works
and

truth
is
a

leaven
of
truth
jesus
bade
his
disciples
beware
of
the
leaven
of
the
pharisees
and
of
the
sadducees
which
he
fined
as
human
doctrines
his
parable
of
the
leaven
which
a
woman
took
and
hid
in
three
measures
of
meal
till
the
whole
was
leavened
impels
the
ence
that
the
spiritual
leaven
signifies
the
science
of
christ
and
its
spiritual
interpretation
an
inference
far
above
the
merely
ecclesiastical
and
formal
applications
of
the
illustration
did
not
this
parable
point
a
moral
with
a
prophecy
foretelling
the
second
appearing
in
the

of
the
christ
truth
hidden
in
sacred
secrecy
from
the

world
ages

but
this
leaven
of
truth
is
ever
at
work
it
must
destroy
the
entire
mass
of
error
and
so
be
eternally
glorified
in
man
spiritual
freedom
the
divine
and
human
contrasted
in
their
spiritual
significance
science
theology
and
medicine
are
means
of
divine
thought
which
include
ual
laws
emanating
from
the
invisible
and
finite
power
and
grace
the
parable
may
import
that
these
spiritual
laws
perverted
by
a
perverse
material
sense
of
law
are
metaphysically
sented
as
three
measures
of
meal
that
is
three
modes
of
mortal
thought
in
all
mortal
forms
of
thought
dust
is
dignified
as
the
natural
status
of
men
and
things
and
modes
of
material
motion
are
honored
with
the
name
of
this
continues
until
the
leaven
of
spirit
changes
the
whole
of
mortal
thought
as
yeast
changes
the
chemical
properties
of
meal
certain
contradictions
the
definitions
of
material
law
as
given
by
natural
science
represent
a
kingdom
necessarily
divided
against
itself
because
these
definitions
portray
law
as
physical
not
spiritual
therefore
they
tradict
the
divine
decrees
and
violate
the
law
of
love
in
which
nature
and
god
are
one
and
the
natural
order
of
heaven
comes
down
to
earth
unescapable
dilemma
when
we
endow
matter
with
vague
spiritual
power
that
is
when
we
do
so
in
our
theories
for
of
course
we
can
not
really
endow
matter
with
what
it
does
not
and
can
not
possess
we
disown
the
mighty
for
such
theories
lead
to
one
of
two
things
they
either
presuppose
the
and
of
matter
or
else
they
assume
that
matter
is
the
product
of
spirit
to
seize
the
first
horn
of
this
dilemma
and
sider
matter
as
a
power
in
and
of
itself
is
to
leave
the
ator
out
of
his
own
universe
while
to
grasp
the
other
horn
of
the
dilemma
and
regard
god
as
the
creator
of
matter
is
not
only
to
make
him
responsible
for
all
ters
physical
and
moral
but
to
announce
him
as
their
source
thereby
making
him
guilty
of
maintaining
ual
misrule
in
the
form
and
under
the
name
of
natural
law
god
and
nature
in
one
sense
god
is
identical
with
nature
but
this
ture
is
spiritual
and
is
not
expressed
in
matter
the
giver
whose
lightning
palsies
or
prostrates
in
death
the
child
at
prayer
is
not
the
divine
ideal
of
omnipresent
love
god
is
natural
good
and
is
sented
only
by
the
idea
of
goodness
while
evil
should
be
regarded
as
unnatural
because
it
is
opposed
to
the
nature
of
spirit
god
the
sun
and
soul
in
viewing
the
sunrise
one
finds
that
it
contradicts
the
evidence
before
the
senses
to
believe
that
the
earth
is
in
motion
and
the
sun
at
rest
as
omy
reverses
the
human
perception
of
the
movement
of
the
solar
system
so
christian
science
verses
the
seeming
relation
of
soul
and
body
and
makes
body
tributary
to
mind
thus
it
is
with
man
who
is
but
the
humble
servant
of
the
restful
mind
though
it
seems
otherwise
to
finite
sense
but
we
shall
never
stand
this
while
we
admit
that
soul
is
in
body
or
mind
in
matter
and
that
man
is
included
in
soul
or
spirit
is
god
unchangeable
and
eternal
and
man
coexists
with
and
reflects
soul
god
for
man
is
image
reversal
of
testimony
science
reverses
the
false
testimony
of
the
physical
senses
and
by
this
reversal
mortals
arrive
at
the
mental
facts
of
being
then
the
question
evitably
arises
is
a
man
sick
if
the
material
senses
indicate
that
he
is
in
good
health
no
for
matter
can
make
no
conditions
for
man
and
is
he
well
if
the
senses
say
he
is
sick
yes
he
is
well
in
science
in
which
health
is
normal
and
disease
is
abnormal
health
and
the
senses
health
is
not
a
condition
of
matter
but
of
mind
nor
can
the
material
senses
bear
reliable
testimony
on
the
ject
of
health
the
science
of
shows
it
to
be
impossible
for
aught
but
mind
to
testify
truly
or
to
exhibit
the
real
status
of
man
fore
the
divine
principle
of
science
reversing
the
mony
of
the
physical
senses
reveals
man
as
harmoniously
existent
in
truth
which
is
the
only
basis
of
health
and
thus
science
denies
all
disease
heals
the
sick
overthrows
false
evidence
and
refutes
materialistic
logic
any
conclusion
or
deduced
from
supposed
sation
in
matter
or
from
matter
supposed
consciousness
of
health
or
disease
instead
of
reversing
the
testimony
of
the
physical
senses
confirms
that
testimony
as
legitimate
and
so
leads
to
disease
historic
illustrations
when
columbus
gave
freer
breath
to
the
globe
ignorance
and
superstition
chained
the
limbs
of
the
brave
old
navigator
and
disgrace
and
vation
stared
him
in
the
face
but
sterner
still
would
have
been
his
fate
if
his
discovery
had
undermined
the
ite
inclinations
of
a
sensuous
philosophy
copernicus
mapped
out
the
stellar
system
and
before
he
spake
astrography
was
chaotic
and
the
heavenly
fields
were
incorrectly
explored
perennial
beauty
the
chaldean
wisemen
read
in
the
stars
the
fate
of
empires
and
the
fortunes
of
men
though
no
higher
revelation
than
the
horoscope
was
to
them
played
upon
the
empyrean
earth
and
heaven
were
bright
and
bird
and
blossom
were
glad
in
perennial
and
happy
sunshine
golden
with
truth
so
we
have
goodness
and
beauty
to
gladden
the
heart
but
man
left
to
the
hypotheses
of
material
sense
unexplained
by
science
is
as
the
wandering
comet
or
the
desolate
star
a
weary
searcher
for
a
viewless
home
astronomic
unfoldings
the
earth
diurnal
rotation
is
invisible
to
the
physical
eye
and
the
sun
seems
to
move
from
east
to
west
instead
of
the
earth
from
west
to
east
until
rebuked
by
clearer
views
of
the
everlasting
facts
this
false
testimony
of
the
eye
deluded
the
judgment
and
duced
false
conclusions
science
shows
appearances
often
to
be
erroneous
and
corrects
these
errors
by
the
simple
rule
that
the
greater
controls
the
lesser
the
sun
is
the
central
stillness
so
far
as
our
solar
system
is
concerned
and
the
earth
revolves
about
the
sun
once
a
year
besides
turning
daily
on
its
own
axis
as
thus
indicated
astronomical
order
imitates
the
action
of
divine
principle
and
the
universe
the
tion
of
god
is
thus
brought
nearer
the
spiritual
fact
and
is
allied
to
divine
science
as
displayed
in
the
everlasting
government
of
the
universe
opposing
testimony
the
evidence
of
the
physical
senses
often
reverses
the
real
science
of
being
and
so
creates
a
reign
of
discord
assigning
seeming
power
to
sin
sickness
and
death
but
the
great
facts
of
life
rightly
derstood
defeat
this
triad
of
errors
contradict
their
false
witnesses
and
reveal
the
kingdom
of
heaven
the
actual
reign
of
harmony
on
earth
the
material
senses
versal
of
the
science
of
soul
was
practically
exposed
teen
hundred
years
ago
by
the
demonstrations
of
jesus
yet
these
senses
still
make
mortal
mind
tributary
to
mortal
body
and
ordain
certain
sections
of
matter
such
as
brain
and
nerves
as
the
seats
of
pain
and
pleasure
from
which
matter
reports
to
this
mind
its
status
of
happiness
or
misery
testimony
of
the
senses
the
optical

is
another
proof
of
the
illusion
of

sense

apparently

that

denying
the
testimony
of

points
to

in
the

and

experience
is
full
of
instances
of
similar
illusions
which
every
thinker
can
recall
for
himself
spiritual
sense
of
life
to
material
sense
the
severance
of
the
jugular
vein
takes
away
life
but
to
spiritual
sense
and
in
science
life
goes
on
unchanged
and
being
is
eternal
temporal
life
is
a
false
sense
of
existence
ptolemaic
and
psychical
error
our
theories
make
the
same
mistake
regarding
soul
and
body
that
ptolemy
made
regarding
the
solar
system
they
insist
that
soul
is
in
body
and
mind
therefore
tary
to
matter
astronomical
science
has
destroyed
the
false
theory
as
to
the
relations
of
the
celestial
bodies
and
christian
science
will
surely
destroy
the
greater
error
as
to
our
terrestrial
bodies
the
true
idea
and
principle
of
man
will
then
appear
the
maic
blunder
could
not
affect
the
harmony
of
being
as
does
the
error
relating
to
soul
and
body
which
reverses
the
order
of
science
and
assigns
to
matter
the
power
and
prerogative
of
spirit
so
that
man
becomes
the
most
absolutely
weak
and
inharmonious
creature
in
the
universe
seeming
and
being
the
verity
of
mind
shows
conclusively
how
it
is
that
matter
seems
to
be
but
is
not
divine
science
rising
above
physical
theories
excludes
matter
resolves
into
and
replaces
the
objects
of
material
sense
with
spiritual
ideas
the
term
christian
science
was
introduced
by
the
author
to
designate
the
scientific
system
of
divine
healing
the
revelation
consists
of
two
parts
the
discovery
of
this
divine
science
of
healing
through
a
spiritual
sense
of
the
scriptures
and
through
the
teachings
of
the
comforter
as
promised
by
the
master
the
proof
by
present
demonstration
that
the
called
miracles
of
jesus
did
not
specially
belong
to
a
dispensation
now
ended
but
that
they
illustrated
an
divine
principle
the
operation
of
this
principle
indicates
the
eternality
of
the
scientific
order
and
continuity
of
being
scientific
basis
christian
science
differs
from
material
ence
but
not
on
that
account
is
it
less
tific
on
the
contrary
christian
science
is
mently
scientific
being
based
on
truth
the
principle
of
all
science
physical
science
a
blind
belief
physical
science
is
human
knowledge
a
law
of
mortal
mind
a
blind
belief
a
samson
shorn
of
his
strength
when
this
human
belief
lacks
izations
to
support
it
its
foundations
are
gone
having
neither
moral
might
spiritual
basis
nor
holy
principle
of
its
own
this
belief
mistakes
effect
for
cause
and
seeks
to
find
life
and
intelligence
in
matter
thus
limiting
life
and
holding
fast
to
discord
and
death
in
a
word
human
belief
is
a
blind
conclusion
from
material
reasoning
this
is
a
mortal
finite
sense
of
things
which
immortal
spirit
silences
forever
right
interpretation
the
universe
like
man
is
to
be
interpreted
by
science
from
its
divine
principle
god
and
then
it
can
be
stood
but
when
explained
on
the
basis
of
physical
sense
and
represented
as
subject
to
growth
maturity
and
decay
the
universe
like
man
is
and
must
continue
to
be
an
enigma
all
force
mental
adhesion
cohesion
and
attraction
are
properties
of
mind
they
belong
to
divine
principle
and
support
the
equipoise
of
that
which
launched
the
earth
in
its
orbit
and
said
to
the
proud
wave
thus
far
and
no
farther
spirit
is
the
life
substance
and
continuity
of
all
things
we
tread
on
forces
withdraw
them
and
creation
must
collapse
human
knowledge
calls
them
forces
of
matter
but
divine
science
declares
that
they
belong
wholly
to
divine
mind
are
inherent
in
this
mind
and
so
restores
them
to
their
rightful
home
and
classification
corporeal
changes
the
elements
and
functions
of
the
physical
body
and
of
the
physical
world
will
change
as
mortal
mind
changes
its
beliefs
what
is
now
considered
the
best
condition
for
organic
and
functional
health
in
the
human
body
may
no
longer
be
found
indispensable
to
health
moral
conditions
will
be
found
always
monious
and
neither
organic
inaction
nor
overaction
is
beyond
god
control
and
man
will
be
found
normal
and
natural
to
changed
mortal
thought
and
therefore
more
harmonious
in
his
manifestations
than
he
was
in
the
prior
states
which
human
belief
created
and
sanctioned
as
human
thought
changes
from
one
stage
to
other
of
conscious
pain
and
painlessness
sorrow
and
joy
from
fear
to
hope
and
from
faith
to
ing
the
visible
manifestation
will
at
last
be
man
erned
by
soul
not
by
material
sense
reflecting
government
man
is
when
subordinate
to
the
divine
spirit
man
can
not
be
controlled
by
sin
or
death
thus
proving
our
material
theories
about
laws
of
health
to
be
valueless
the
time
and
tide
the
seasons
will
come
and
go
with
changes
of
time
and
tide
cold
and
heat
latitude
and
longitude
the
culturist
will
find
that
these
changes
can
not
affect
his
crops

the
point
at

between

on

hand
and

on

is
this
shall

explain

in

on
which
to
found
my

except
the
teachings
and
demonstrations
of
our
great
master
and
the

of

and

the

has

my
only

i
have
had
no

guide
in

straight
and
narrow
way
of

science
and

if
christendom
resists
the
author
application
of
the

science
to
christianity
or
questions
her
use
of
the
word
science
she
will
not
therefore
lose

nor
will
christianity
lose
its
hold
upon
her
if
god
the
be
the
creator
of
the
spiritual
universe
including
man
then
everything
entitled
to
a
classification
as
truth
or
science
must
be
comprised
in
a
knowledge
or
understanding
of
god
for
there
can
be
nothing
beyond
illimitable
divinity
scientific
terms
the
terms
divine
science
spiritual
science
christ
science
or
christian
science
or
science
alone
she
ploys
interchangeably
according
to
the
quirements
of
the
context
these
mous
terms
stand
for
everything
relating
to
god
the
finite
supreme
eternal
mind
it
may
be
said
however
that
the
term
christian
science
relates
especially
to
science
as
applied
to
humanity
christian
science
veals
god
not
as
the
author
of
sin
sickness
and
death
but
as
divine
principle
supreme
being
mind
exempt
from
all
evil
it
teaches
that
matter
is
the
falsity
not
the
fact
of
existence
that
nerves
brain
stomach
lungs
and
so
forth
have
as
matter
no
intelligence
life
nor
sensation
no
physical
science
there
is
no
physical
science
inasmuch
as
all
truth
proceeds
from
the
divine
mind
therefore
truth
is
not
human
and
is
not
a
law
of
matter
for
matter
is
not
a
lawgiver
science
is
an
emanation
of
divine
mind
and
is
alone
able
to
interpret
god
aright
it
has
a
spiritual
and
not
a
material
origin
it
is
a
divine
utterance
the
comforter
which
leadeth
into
all
truth
christian
science
eschews
what
is
called
natural
science
in
so
far
as
this
is
built
on
the
false
hypotheses
that
matter
is
its
own
lawgiver
that
law
is
founded
on
material
ditions
and
that
these
are
final
and
overrule
the
might
of
divine
mind
good
is
natural
and
primitive
it
is
not
miraculous
to
itself
practical
science
the
term
science
properly
understood
refers
only
to
the
laws
of
god
and
to
his
government
of
the
universe
inclusive
of
man
from
this
it
follows
that
business
men
and
cultured
scholars
have
found
that
christian
science
enhances
their
endurance
and
mental
powers
enlarges
their
perception
of
character
gives
them
acuteness
and
comprehensiveness
and
an
ability
to
exceed
their
ordinary
capacity
the
human
mind
imbued
with
this
spiritual
understanding
becomes
more
elastic
is
capable
of
greater
endurance
escapes
somewhat
from
itself
and
requires
less
repose
a
edge
of
the
science
of
being
develops
the
latent
abilities
and
possibilities
of
man
it
extends
the
atmosphere
of
thought
giving
mortals
access
to
broader
and
higher
realms
it
raises
the
thinker
into
his
native
air
of
insight
and
perspicacity
an
odor
becomes
beneficent
and
agreeable
only
in
portion
to
its
escape
into
the
surrounding
atmosphere
so
it
is
with
our
knowledge
of
truth
if
one
would
not
quarrel
with
his
for
waking
him
from
a
cataleptic
nightmare
he
should
not
resist
truth
which
banishes
yea
forever
destroys
with
the
higher
mony
of
spirit
the
evidence
of
matter
mathematics
and
scientific
logic
science
relates
to
mind
not
matter
it
rests
on
fixed
principle
and
not
upon
the
judgment
of
false
sensation
the
addition
of
two
sums
in
mathematics
must
always
bring
the
same
result
so
is
it
with
logic
if
both
the
major
and
the
minor
sitions
of
a
syllogism
are
correct
the
conclusion
if
properly
drawn
can
not
be
false
so
in
christian
science
there
are
no
discords
nor
contradictions
because
its
logic
is
as
harmonious
as
the
reasoning
of
an
accurately
stated
logism
or
of
a
properly
computed
sum
in
arithmetic
truth
is
ever
truthful
and
can
tolerate
no
error
in
premise
or
conclusion
truth
by
inversion
if
you
wish
to
know
the
spiritual
fact
you
can
cover
it
by
reversing
the
material
fable
be
the
fable
or
be
it
in
accord
with
your
preconceptions
or
utterly
contrary
to
them
antagonistic
theories
pantheism
may
be
defined
as
a
belief
in
the
gence
of
matter
a
belief
which
science
overthrows
in
those
days
there
will
be
great
tribulation
such
as
was
not
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
and
earth
will
echo
the
cry
art
thou
truth
come
hither
to
torment
us
before
the

animal
magnetism
hypnotism
spiritualism
theosophy
ticism
pantheism
and
infidelity
are
antagonistic
to
true
being
and
fatal
to
its
demonstration
and
so
are
some
other
systems
ontology
needed
we
must
abandon
pharmaceutics
and
take
up
ogy
the
science
of
real
being
we
must
look
deep
into
realism
instead
of
accepting
only
the
ward
sense
of
things
can
we
gather
peaches
from
a
or
learn
from
discord
the
concord
of
being
yet
quite
as
rational
are
some
of
the
leading
illusions
along
the
path
which
science
must
tread
in
its
reformatory
mission
among
mortals
the
very
name
illusion
points
to
nothingness
reluctant
guests
the
generous
liver
may
object
to
the
author
small
estimate
of
the
pleasures
of
the
table
the
sinner
sees
in
the
system
taught
in
this
book
that
the
demands
of
god
must
be
met
the
petty
intellect
is
alarmed
by
stant
appeals
to
mind
the
licentious
disposition
is
couraged
over
its
slight
spiritual
prospects
when
all
men
are
bidden
to
the
feast
the
cuses
come
one
has
a
farm
another
has
merchandise
and
therefore
they
can
not
accept
excuses
for
ignorance
it
is
vain
to
speak
dishonestly
of
divine
science
which
destroys
all
discord
when
you
can
demonstrate
the
actuality
of
science
it
is
unwise
to
doubt
if
reality
is
in
perfect
harmony
with
god
divine
principle
if
science
when
understood
and
demonstrated
will
destroy
all
discord
since
you
admit
that
god
is
nipotent
for
from
this
premise
it
follows
that
good
and
its
sweet
concords
have
children
and
adults
christian
science
properly
understood
would
abuse
the
human
mind
of
material
beliefs
which
war
against
spiritual
facts
and
these
material
beliefs
must
be
denied
and
cast
out
to
make
place
for
truth
you
can
not
add
to
the
contents
of
a
vessel
already
full
laboring
long
to
shake
the
faith
in
matter
and
to
inculcate
a
grain
of
faith
in
god
an
inkling
of
the
ability
of
spirit
to
make
the
body
monious
the
author
has
often
remembered
our
love
for
little
children
and
understood
how
truly
such
as
they
belong
to
the
heavenly
kingdom
all
evil
unnatural
if
thought
is
startled
at
the
strong
claim
of
science
for
the
supremacy
of
god
or
truth
and
doubts
the
premacy
of
good
ought
we
not
wise
to
be
astounded
at
the
vigorous
claims
of
evil
and
doubt
them
and
no
longer
think
it
natural
to
love
sin
and
unnatural
to
forsake
it
no
longer
imagine
evil
to
be
and
good
absent
truth
should
not
seem
so
surprising
and
unnatural
as
error
and
error
should
not
seem
so
real
as
truth
sickness
should
not
seem
so
real
as
health
there
is
no
error
in
science
and
our
lives
must
be
governed
by
reality
in
order
to
be
in
mony
with
god
the
divine
principle
of
all
being
the
error
of
carnality
when
once
destroyed
by
divine
science
the
false
dence
before
the
corporeal
senses
disappears
hence
the
opposition
of
sensuous
man
to
the
science
of
soul
and
the
significance
of
the
scripture
the
carnal
mind
is
enmity
against
god
the
central
fact
of
the
bible
is
the
superiority
of
spiritual
over
physical
power
theology
churchly
neglect
must
christian
science
come
through
the
christian
churches
as
some
persons
insist
this
science
has
come
already
after
the
manner
of
god
ing
but
the
churches
seem
not
ready
to
ceive
it
according
to
the
scriptural
saying
he
came
unto
his
own
and
his
own
received
him
not
jesus
once
said
i
thank
thee
o
father
lord
of
heaven
and
earth
that
thou
hast
hid
these
things
from
the
wise
and
prudent
and
hast
revealed
them
unto
babes
even
so
father
for
so
it
seemed
good
in
thy
sight
as
time
the
spirit
of
the
christ
which
taketh
away
the
monies
and
doctrines
of
men
is
not
accepted
until
the
hearts
of
men
are
made
ready
for
it
john
the
baptist
and
the
messiah
the
mission
of
jesus
confirmed
prophecy
and
plained
the
miracles
of
olden
time
as
natural
demonstrations
of
the
divine
power
tions
which
were
not
understood
jesus
works
established
his
claim
to
the
messiahship
in
reply
to
john
inquiry
art
thou
he
that
should
come
jesus
returned
an
affirmative
reply
recounting
his
works
instead
of
referring
to
his
doctrine
confident
that
this
exhibition
of
the
divine
power
to
heal
would
fully
swer
the
question
hence
his
reply
go
and
show
john
again
those
things
which
ye
do
hear
and
see
the
blind
receive
their
sight
and
the
lame
walk
the
lepers
are
cleansed
and
the
deaf
hear
the
dead
are
raised
up
and
the
poor
have
the
gospel
preached
to
them
and
blessed
is
he
whosoever
shall
not
be
offended
in
me
in
other
words
he
gave
his
benediction
to
any
one
who
should
not
deny
that
such
effects
coming
from
divine
mind
prove
the
unity
of
god
the
divine
principle
which
brings
out
all
harmony
christ
rejected
the
pharisees
of
old
thrust
the
spiritual
idea
and
the
man
who
lived
it
out
of
their
synagogues
and
retained
their
materialistic
beliefs
about
god
system
of
healing
received
no
aid
nor
approval
from
other
sanitary
or
religious
systems
from
doctrines
of
physics
or
of
divinity
and
it
has
not
yet
been
ally
accepted
as
of
yore
unconscious
of
the
reappearing
of
the
spiritual
idea
blind
belief
shuts
the
door
upon
it
and
condemns
the
cure
of
the
sick
and
ning
if
it
is
wrought
on
any
but
a
material
and
a
doctrinal
theory
anticipating
this
rejection
of
idealism
of
the
true
idea
of
god
this
salvation
from
all
error
cal
and

asked
when
the
son
of

cometh
shall
he
find

john
misgivings
did
the
doctrines
of
john
the
baptist
confer
healing
power
upon
him
or
endow
him
with
the
truest
tion
of
the
christ
this
righteous
preacher
once
pointed
his
disciples
to
jesus
as
the
lamb
of
god
yet
afterwards
he
seriously
questioned
the
signs
of
the
messianic
appearing
and
sent
the
inquiry
to
jesus
art
thou
he
that
should
come
faith
according
to
works
was
john
faith
greater
than
that
of
the
samaritan
woman
who
said
is
not
this
the
christ
there
was
also
a
certain
centurion
of
whose
faith
jesus
himself
declared
i
have
not
found
so
great
faith
no
not
in
israel
in
egypt
it
was
mind
which
saved
the
israelites
from
belief
in
the
plagues
in
the
wilderness
streams
flowed
from
the
rock
and
manna
fell
from
the
sky
the
israelites
looked
upon
the
brazen
serpent
and
straightway
believed
that
they
were
healed
of
the
poisonous
stings
of
vipers
in
national
prosperity
miracles
attended
the
successes
of
the
hebrews
but
when
they
departed
from
the
true
idea
their
demoralization
began
even
in
captivity
among
foreign
nations
the
divine
principle
wrought
wonders
for
the
people
of
god
in
the
fiery
furnace
and
in
kings
palaces
judaism
antipathetic
judaism
was
the
antithesis
of
christianity
because
judaism
engendered
the
limited
form
of
a
national
or
tribal
religion
it
was
a
finite
and
material
system
carried
out
in
special
theories
ing
god
man
sanitary
methods
and
a
religious
cultus
that
he
made
himself
equal
with
god
was
one
of
the
jewish
accusations
against
him
who
planted
christianity
on
the
foundation
of
spirit
who
taught
as
he
was
spired
by
the
father
and
would
recognize
no
life
gence
nor
substance
outside
of
god
priestly
learning
the
jewish
conception
of
god
as
yawah
jehovah
or
only
a
mighty
hero
and
king
has
not
quite
given
place
to
the
true
knowledge
of
god
creeds
and
rituals
have
not
cleansed
their
hands
of
rabbinical
lore
the
cry
of
bygone
ages
is
peated
crucify
him
at
every
advancing
step
truth
is
still
opposed
with
sword
and
spear
testimony
of
martyrs
the
word
from
the
greek
means
but
those
who
testified
for
truth
were
so
often
persecuted
unto
death
that
at
length
the
word
was
narrowed
in
its
significance
and
so
has
come
always
to
mean
one
who
suffers
for
his
convictions
the
new
faith
in
the
christ
truth
so
roused
the
hatred
of
the
opponents
of
christianity
that
the
followers
of
christ
were
burned
crucified
and
otherwise
persecuted
and
so
it
came
about
that
human
rights
were
hallowed
by
the
gallows
and
the
cross
absence
of
doctrines
are
waning
they
have
not
waxed
strong
in
times
of
trouble
devoid
of
the
how
can
they
illustrate
the
doctrines
of
christ
or
the
miracles
of
grace
denial
of
the
bility
of
christian
healing
robs
christianity
of
the
very
element
which
gave
it
divine
force
and
its
astonishing
and
unequalled
success
in
the
first
century
basis
of
miracles
the
true
logos
is
demonstrably
christian
science
the
natural
law
of
harmony
which
overcomes
discord
not
because
this
science
is
supernatural
or
ternatural
nor
because
it
is
an
infraction
of
divine
law
but
because
it
is
the
immutable
law
of
god
good
jesus
said
i

thou
hearest
me
ways
and
he
raised
lazarus

healed
the

on

water
there
is
divine
authority
for
believing
in
the
superiority
of
spiritual
power
over
material
resistance
lawful
wonders
a
miracle
fulfils
god
law
but
does
not
violate
that
law
this
fact
at
present
seems
more
mysterious
than
the
miracle
itself
the
psalmist
sang
what
ailed
thee
o
thou
sea
that
thou
fleddest
thou
jordan
that
thou
wast
driven
back
ye
mountains
that
ye
skipped
like
rams

ye
little
hills
like
lambs
tremble
thou
earth
at
the
presence
of
the
lord
at
the
presence
of
the
god
of
jacob
the
miracle
introduces
no
disorder
but
unfolds
the
primal
order
establishing
the
science
of
god
unchangeable
law
spiritual
evolution
alone
is
worthy
of
the
exercise
of
divine
power
fear
and
sickness
identical
the
same
power
which
heals
sin
heals
also
sickness
this
is
the
beauty
of
holiness
that
when
truth
heals
the
sick
it
casts
out
evils
and
when
truth
casts
out
the
evil
called
disease
it
heals
the
sick
when
christ
cast
out
the
devil
of
dumbness
it
came
to
pass
when
the
devil
was
gone
out
the
dumb
spake
there
is
danger
of
repeating
the
offence
of
the
jews
by
limiting
the
holy
one
of
israel
and
asking
can
god
furnish
a
table
in
the
wilderness
what
can
not
god
do
the
unity
of
science
and
christianity
it
has
been
said
and
truly
that
christianity
must
be
science
and
science
must
be
christianity
else
one
or
the
other
is
false
and
useless
but
neither
is
portant
or
untrue
and
they
are
alike
in
stration
this
proves
the
one
to
be
identical
with
the
other
christianity
as
jesus
taught
it
was
not
a
creed
nor
a
system
of
ceremonies
nor
a
special
gift
from
a
ritualistic
jehovah
but
it
was
the
demonstration
of
divine
love
casting
out
error
and
healing
the
sick
not
merely
in
the
of
christ
or
truth
but
in
stration
of
truth
as
must
be
the
case
in
the
cycles
of
divine
light
the
jesus
established
his
church
and
maintained
his
mission
on
a
spiritual
foundation
of
he
taught
his
followers
that
his
religion
had
a
divine
principle
which
would
cast
out
error
and
heal
both
the
sick
and
the
sinning
he
claimed
no
gence
action
nor
life
separate
from
god
despite
the
persecution
this
brought
upon
him
he
used
his
divine
power
to
save
men
both
bodily
and
spiritually
ancient
spiritualism
the
question
then
as
now
was
how
did
jesus
heal
the
sick
his
answer
to
this
question
the
world
rejected
he
appealed
to
his
students
whom
do
men
say
that
i
the
son
of
man
am
that
is
who
or
what
is
it
that
is
thus
identified
with
casting
out
evils
and
healing
the
sick
they
replied
some
say
that
thou
art
john
the
baptist
some
elias
and
others
jeremias
or
one
of
the
prophets
these
prophets
were
considered
dead
and
this
reply
may
indicate
that
some
of
the
people
believed
that
jesus
was
a
medium
controlled
by
the
spirit
of
john
or
of
elias
this
ghostly
fancy
was
repeated
by
herod
himself
that
a
wicked
king
and
debauched
husband
should
have
no
high
appreciation
of
divine
science
and
the
great
work
of
the
master
was
not
surprising
for
how
could
such
a
sinner
comprehend
what
the
disciples
did
not
fully
understand
but
even
herod
doubted
if
jesus
was
trolled
by
the
sainted
preacher
hence
herod
tion
john
have
i
beheaded
but
who
is
this
no
wonder
herod
desired
to
see
the
new
teacher
doubting
disciples
the
disciples
apprehended
their
master
better
than
did
others
but
they
did
not
comprehend
all
that
he
said
and
did
or
they
would
not
have
questioned
him
so
often
jesus
patiently
persisted
in
teaching
and
demonstrating
the
truth
of
being
his
dents
saw
this
power
of
truth
heal
the
sick
cast
out
evil
raise
the
dead
but
the
ultimate
of
this
wonderful
work
was
not
spiritually
discerned
even
by
them
until
after
the
crucifixion
when
their
immaculate
teacher
stood
before
them
the
victor
over
sickness
sin
disease
death
and
the
grave
yearning
to
be
understood
the
master
repeated
but
whom
say
that
i
am
this
renewed
inquiry
meant
who
or
what
is
it
that
is
able
to
do
the
work
so
mysterious
to
the
popular
mind
in
his
rejection
of
the
answer
already
given
and
his
renewal
of
the
question
it
is
plain
that
jesus
completely
eschewed
the
narrow
opinion
implied
in
their
citation
of
the
common
report
about
him
a
divine
response
with
his
usual
impetuosity
simon
replied
for
his
brethren
and
his
reply
set
forth
a
great
fact
thou
art
the
christ
the
son
of
the
living
god
that
is
the
messiah
is
what
thou
hast
clared
christ
the
spirit
of
god
of
truth
life
and
love
which
heals
mentally
this
assertion
elicited
from
jesus
the
benediction
blessed
art
thou
simon
jona
for
flesh
and
blood
hath
not
revealed
it
unto
thee
but
my
father
which
is
in
heaven
that
is
love
hath
shown
thee
the
way
of
life
the
true
and
living
rock
before
this
the
impetuous
disciple
had
been
called
only
by
his
common
names
simon
or
son
of
jona
but
now
the
master
gave
him
a
itual
name
in
these
words
and
i
say
also
unto
thee
that
thou
art
peter
and
upon
this
rock
the
meaning
of
the
greek
word
or
i
will
build
my
church
and
the
gates
of
hell
the
or
the
shall
not
prevail
against
it
in
other
words
jesus
purposed
founding
his
society
not
on
the
personal
peter
as
a
mortal
but
on
the
power
which
lay
behind
peter
confession
of
the
true
messiah
sublime
summary
it
was
now
evident
to
peter
that
divine
life
truth
and
love
and
not
a
human
personality
was
the
healer
of
the
sick
and
a
rock
a
firm
foundation
in
the
realm
of
harmony
on
this
spiritually
scientific
basis
jesus
explained
his
cures
which
appeared
miraculous
to
outsiders
he
showed
that
diseases
were
cast
out
neither
by
corporeality
by
nor
by
hygiene
but
by
the
divine
spirit
casting
out
the
errors
of
mortal
mind
the
supremacy
of
spirit
was
the
foundation
on
which
jesus
built
his
sublime
summary
points
to
the
religion
of
love
new
era
in
jesus
jesus
established
in
the
christian
era
the
precedent
for
all
christianity
theology
and
healing
christians
are
under
as
direct
orders
now
as
they
were
then
to
be
christlike
to
possess
the
to
follow
the
and
to
heal
the
sick
as
well
as
the
sinning
it
is
easier
for
christianity
to
cast
out
ness
than
sin
for
the
sick
are
more
willing
to
part
with
pain
than
are
sinners
to
give
up
the
sinful
ure
of
the
senses
the
christian
can
prove
this
as
readily
is
it
was
proved
centuries
ago
healthful
theology
our
master
said
to
every
follower
go
ye
into
all
the
world
and
preach
the
gospel
to
every
creature
heal
the
sick
love
thy
neighbor
as
thyself
it
was
this
theology
of
jesus
which
healed
the
sick
and
the
sinning
it
is
his
theology
in
this
book
and
the
spiritual
meaning
of
this
theology
which
heals
the
sick
and
causes
the
wicked
to
forsake
his
way
and
the
unrighteous
man
his
thoughts
it
was
our
ter
theology
which
the
impious
sought
to
destroy
marvels
and
reformations
from
beginning
to
end
the
scriptures
are
full
of
accounts
of
the
triumph
of
spirit
mind
over
matter
moses
proved
the
power
of
mind
by
what
men
called
miracles
so
did
joshua
elijah
and
elisha
the
christian
era
was
ushered
in
with
signs
and
wonders
reforms
have
commonly
been
attended
with
bloodshed
and
persecution
even
when
the
end
has
been
brightness
and
peace
but
the
present
new
yet
old
form
in
religious
faith
will
teach
men
patiently
and
wisely
to
stem
the
tide
of
sectarian
bitterness
whenever
it
flows
inward
science
obscured
the
decisions
by
vote
of
church
councils
as
to
what
should
and
should
not
be
considered
holy

the
ifest
mistakes
in
the
ancient
versions
the
thirty
thousand
different
readings
in
the
old
testament
and
the
three
hundred
thousand
in
the
new
these
facts
show
how
a
mortal
and
material
sense
stole
into
the
divine
record
with
its
own
hue
darkening
to
some
extent
the
inspired
pages
but
mistakes
could
neither
wholly
obscure
the
divine
science
of
the
scriptures
seen
from
genesis
to
revelation
mar
the
demonstration
of
jesus
nor
annul
the
healing
by
the
prophets
who
foresaw
that
the
stone
which
the
builders
rejected
would
come
the
head
of
the
corner
opponents
benefited
atheism
pantheism
theosophy
and
agnosticism
are
opposed
to
christian
science
as
they
are
to
ordinary
ligion
but
it
does
not
follow
that
the
profane
or
atheistic
invalid
can
not
be
healed
by
tian
science
the
moral
condition
of
such
a
man
mands
the
remedy
of
truth
more
than
it
is
needed
in
most
cases
and
science
is
more
than
usually
effectual
in
the
treatment
of
moral
ailments
god
invisible
to
the
senses
that
god
is
a
corporeal
being
nobody
can
truly
affirm
the
bible
represents
him
as
saying
thou
canst
not
see
my
face
for
there
shall
no
man
see
me
and
live
not
materially
but
spiritually
we
know
him
as
divine
mind
as
life
truth
and
love
we
shall
obey
and
adore
in
proportion
as
we
apprehend
the
divine
nature
and
love
him
understandingly
warring
no
more
over
the
corporeality
but
rejoicing
in
the
affluence
of
our
god
religion
will
then
be
of
the
heart
and
not
of
the
head
mankind
will
no
longer
be
tyrannical
and
scriptive
from
lack
of
love
straining
out
gnats
and
swallowing
camels
the
true
worship
we
worship
spiritually
only
as
we
cease
to
worship

spiritual
devoutness
is
the
soul
of
tianity
worshipping
through
the
medium
of

is
paganism
judaic
and
other

are
but
types
and
shadows
of
true
worship
the
true
worshippers
shall
worship
the
father
in
spirit
and
in
truth
anthropomorphism
the
jewish
tribal
jehovah
was
a
god
liable
to
wrath
repentance
and
human
changeableness
the
christian
science
god
is
universal
nal
divine
love
which
changeth
not
and
eth
no
evil
disease
nor
death
it
is
indeed
mournfully
true
that
the
older
scripture
is
reversed
in
the
ing
god
created
man
in
his
god
image
but
tals
would
procreate
man
and
make
god
in
their
own
human
image
what
is
the
god
of
a
mortal
but
a
mortal
magnified
more
than
profession
required
this
indicates
the
distance
between
the
theological
and
ritualistic
religion
of
the
ages
and
the
truth
preached
by
jesus
more
than
profession
is
requisite
for
christian
demonstration
few
understand
or
adhere
to
jesus
divine
precepts
for
living
and
healing
why
because
his
precepts
require
the
ple
to
cut
off
the
right
hand
and
pluck
out
the
right
eye
that
is
to
set
aside
even
the
most
cherished
beliefs
and
practices
to
leave
all
for
christ
no
ecclesiastical
monopoly
all
revelation
such
is
the
popular
thought
must
come
from
the
schools
and
along
the
line
of
scholarly
and
siastical
descent
as
kings
are
crowned
from
a
royal
dynasty
in
healing
the
sick
and
sinning
jesus
elaborated
the
fact
that
the
healing
effect
followed
the
understanding
of
the
divine
principle
and
of
the
which
governed
the
corporeal
jesus
for
this
principle
there
is
no
dynasty
no
ecclesiastical
monopoly
its
only
crowned
head
is
immortal
eignty
its
only
priest
is
the
spiritualized
man
the
bible
declares
that
all
believers
are
made
kings
and
priests
unto
god
the
outsiders
did
not
then
and
do
not
now
understand
this
ruling
of
the
christ
fore
they
can
not
demonstrate
god
healing
power
neither
can
this
manifestation
of
christ
be
prehended
until
its
divine
principle
is
scientifically
understood
a
change
demanded
the
adoption
of
scientific
religion
and
of
divine
ing
will
ameliorate
sin
sickness
and
death
let
our
pulpits
do
justice
to
christian
science
let
it
have
fair
representation
by
the
press
give
to
it
the
place
in
our
institutions
of
learning
now
pied
by
scholastic
theology
and
physiology
and
it
will
eradicate
sickness
and
sin
in
less
time
than
the
old
systems
devised
for
subduing
them
have
required
for
lishment
and
propagation
two
claims
omitted
anciently
the
followers
of
christ
or
truth
measured
christianity
by
its
power
over
sickness
sin
and
death
but
modern
religions
generally
omit
all
but
one
of
these
powers
the
power
over
sin
we
must
seek
the
undivided
garment
the
whole
christ
as
our
first
proof
of
christianity
for
christ
truth
alone
can
furnish
us
with
absolute
evidence
selfishness
and
loss
if
the
soft
palm
upturned
to
a
lordly
salary
and
tectural
skill
making
dome
and
spire
tremulous
with
beauty
turn
the
poor
and
the
stranger
from
the
gate
they
at
the
same
time
shut
the
door
on
progress
in
vain
do
the
manger
and
the
cross
tell
their
story
to
pride
and
fustian
sensuality
palsies
the
right
hand
and
causes
the
left
to
let
go
its
grasp
on
the
divine
temple
cleansed
as
in
jesus
time
so
tyranny
and
pride
need
to
be
whipped
out
of
the
temple
and
humility
and
divine
ence
to
be
welcomed
in
the
strong
cords
of
scientific
demonstration
as
twisted
and
wielded
by
jesus
are
still
needed
to
purge
the
temples
of
their
vain
traffic
in
worldly
worship
and
to
make
them
meet
for
the
most
high
medicine
question
of
precedence
which
was
first
mind
or
medicine
if
mind
was
first
and
then
mind
not
matter
must
have
been
the
first
medicine
god
being
all
he
made
medicine
but
that
medicine
was
mind
it
could
not
have
been
matter
which
departs
from
the
nature
and
character
of
mind
god
truth
is
god
remedy
for
error
of
every
kind
and
truth
stroys
only
what
is
untrue
hence
the
fact
that
as
yesterday
christ
casts
out
evils
and
heals
the
sick
methods
rejected
it
is
plain
that
god
does
not
employ
drugs
or
hygiene
nor
provide
them
for
human
use
else
jesus
would
have
recommended
and
employed
them
in
his
ing
the
sick
are
more
deplorably
lost
than
the
sinning
if
the
sick
can
not
rely
on
god
for
help
and
the
sinning
can
the
divine
mind
never
called
matter
and
matter
required
a
material
and
human
lief
before
it
could
be
considered
as
medicine
error
not
curative
sometimes
the
human
mind
uses
one
error
to
cine
another
driven
to
choose
between
two
difficulties
the
human
mind
takes
the
lesser
to
relieve
the
greater
on
this
basis
it
saves
from
tion
by
theft
and
quiets
pain
with
anodynes
you
admit
that
mind
influences
the
body
somewhat
but
you
conclude
that
the
stomach
blood
nerves
bones
hold
the
preponderance
of
power
controlled
by
this
belief
you
continue
in
the
old
routine
you
lean
on
the
inert
and
unintelligent
never
discerning
how
this
prives
you
of
the
available
superiority
of
divine
mind
the
body
is
not
controlled
scientifically
by
a
negative
mind
impossible
coalescence
mind
is
the
grand
creator
and
there
can
be
no
power
except
that
which
is
derived
from
mind
if
mind
was
first
chronologically
is
first
potentially
and
must
be
first
eternally
then
give
to
mind
the
glory
honor
dominion
and
power
everlastingly
due
its
holy
name
inferior
and
unspiritual
methods
of
healing
may
try
to
make
mind
and
drugs
coalesce
but
the
two
will
not
mingle
scientifically
why
should
we
wish
to
make
them
do
so
since
no
good
can
come
of
it
if
mind
is
foremost
and
superior
let
us
rely
upon
mind
which
needs
no
cooperation
from
lower
powers
even
if
these
powers
are

naught

a
question
whether

whether

divinely
imbued
were
they
with
the
spirit
of
science
that
the
lack
of
the
letter
could
not
hinder
their
work
and
that
letter
without
the
spirit
would
have
made
void
their
practice
the
struggle
and
victory
the
struggle
for
the
recovery
of
invalids
goes
on
not
between
material
methods
but
between
mortal
minds
and
immortal
mind
the
victory
will
be
on
the
patient
side
only
as
immortal
mind
through
christ
truth
subdues
the
human
belief
in
disease
it
matters
not
what
material
method
one
may
adopt
whether
faith
in
drugs
trust
in
hygiene
or
reliance
on
some
other
minor
curative
mystery
of
godliness
scientific
healing
has
this
advantage
over
other
ods
that
in
it
truth
controls
error
from
this
fact
arise
its
ethical
as
well
as
its
physical
fects
indeed
its
ethical
and
physical
effects
are
indissolubly
connected
if
there
is
any
mystery
in
christian
healing
it
is
the
mystery
which
godliness
always
presents
to
the
ungodly
the
mystery
always
arising
from
ignorance
of
the
laws
of
eternal
and
ing
mind
matter
matter
other
methods
undertake
to
oppose
error
with
error
and
thus
they
increase
the
antagonism
of
one
form
of
matter
towards
other
forms
of
matter
or
error
and
the
warfare
between
spirit
and
the
flesh
goes
on
by
this
antagonism
mortal
mind
must
tinually
weaken
its
own
assumed
power
how
healing
was
lost
the
theology
of
christian
science
includes
healing
the
sick
our
master
first
article
of
faith
propounded
to
his
students
was
healing
and
he
proved
his
faith
by
his
works
the
ancient
christians
were
healers
why
has
this
element
of
christianity
been
lost
because
our
systems
of
religion
are
governed
more
or
less
by
our
systems
of
medicine
the
first
atry
was
faith
in
matter
the
schools
have
rendered
faith
in
drugs
the
fashion
rather
than
faith
in
deity
by
trusting
matter
to
destroy
its
own
discord
health
and
harmony
have
been
sacrificed
such
systems
are
barren
of
the
vitality
of
spiritual
power
by
which
material
sense
is
made
the
servant
of
science
and
religion
becomes
christlike
drugs
and
divinity
material
medicine
substitutes
drugs
for
the
power
of
god
even
the
might
of
mind
to
heal
the
body
scholasticism
clings
for
salvation
to
the
son
instead
of
to
the
divine
principle
of
the
man
jesus
and
his
science
the
curative
agent
of
god
is
silenced
why
because
truth
divests
material
drugs
of
their
imaginary
power
and
clothes
spirit
with
acy
science
is
the
stranger
that
is
within
thy
gates
remembered
not
even
when
its
elevating
effects
tically
prove
its
divine
origin
and
efficacy
christian
science
as
old
as
god
divine
science
derives
its
sanction
from
the
bible
and
the
divine
origin
of
science
is
demonstrated
through
the
holy
influence
of
truth
in
healing
ness
and
sin
this
healing
power
of
truth
must
have
been
far
anterior
to
the
period
in
which
jesus
lived
it
is
as
ancient
as
the
ancient
of
days
it
lives
through
all
life
and
extends
throughout
all
space
reduction
to

divine
metaphysics
is
now
reduced
to
a
system
to
a
form
comprehensible
by
and
adapted
to
the
thought
of
the
age
in
which
we
live
this
system
enables
the
learner
to
demonstrate
the
divine
principle
upon
which
jesus
healing
was
based
and
the
sacred
rules
for
its
present
application
to
the
cure
of
disease
late
in
the
nineteenth
century
i
demonstrated
the
divine
rules
of
christian
science
they
were
submitted
to
the
broadest
practical
test
and
everywhere
when
honestly
plied
under
circumstances
where
demonstration
was
manly
possible
this
science
showed
that
truth
had
lost
none
of
its
divine
and
healing
efficacy
even
though
turies
had
passed
away
since
jesus
practised
these
rules
on
the
hills
of
judaea
and
in
the
valleys
of
galilee
perusal
and
practice
although
this
volume
contains
the
complete
science
of
never
believe
that
you
can
absorb
the
whole
meaning
of
the
science
by
a
simple
of
this
book
the
book
needs
to
be
and
the
demonstration
of
the
rules
of
scientific
healing
will
plant
you
firmly
on
the
spiritual
groundwork
of
christian
science
this
proof
lifts
you
high
above
the
perishing
fossils
of
theories
already
antiquated
and
ables
you
to
grasp
the
spiritual
facts
of

hitherto
unattained
and

our
master
healed
the

practised
christian
ing
and
taught
the
generalities
of
its
divine
principle
to
his
students
but
he
left
no
definite
rule
for
demonstrating
this
principle
of
healing
and
preventing
disease
this
rule
remained
to
be
discovered
in
christian
science
a
pure
affection
takes
form
in
ness
but
science
alone
reveals
the
divine
principle
of
goodness
and
demonstrates
its
rules
jesus
own
practice
jesus
never
spoke
of
disease
as
dangerous
or
as
difficult
to
heal
when
his
students
brought
to
him
a
case
they
had
failed
to
heal
he
said
to
them
o
faithless
eration
implying
that
the
requisite
power
to
heal
was
in
mind
he
prescribed
no
drugs
urged
no
obedience
to
material
laws
but
acted
in
direct
disobedience
to
them
the
man
of
anatomy
and
of
theology
neither
anatomy
nor
theology
has
ever
described
man
as
created
by
spirit
as
god
man
the
former
plains
the
men
of
or
the
children
of
men
as
created
corporeally
instead
of
itually
and
as
emerging
from
the
lowest
stead
of
from
the
highest
conception
of
being
both
anatomy
and
theology
define
man
as
both
physical
and
mental
and
place
mind
at
the
mercy
of
matter
for
every
function
formation
and
manifestation
anatomy
takes
up
man
at
all
points
materially
it
loses
spirit
drops
the
true
tone
and
accepts
the
discord
anatomy
and
ology
reject
the
divine
principle
which
produces
nious
man
and
deal
the
one
wholly
the
other
primarily
with
matter
calling
that
which
is
not
the
part
but
the
counterfeit
of
god
man
then
theology
tries
to
explain
how
to
make
this
man
a
christian
how
from
this
basis
of
division
and
discord
to
produce
the
cord
and
unity
of
spirit
and
his
likeness
physiology
deficient
physiology
exalts
matter
dethrones
mind
and
claims
to
rule
man
by
material
law
instead
of
spiritual
when
physiology
fails
to
give
health
or
life
by
this
process
it
ignores
the
divine
spirit
as
unable
or
unwilling
to
render
help
in
time
of
physical
need
when
mortals
sin
this
ruling
of
the
schools
leaves
them
to
the
guidance
of
a
theology
which
admits
god
to
be
the
healer
of
sin
but
not
of
sickness
although
our
great
master
demonstrated
that
truth
could
save
from
sickness
as
well
as
from
sin
blunders
and
blunderers
mind
as
far
outweighs
drugs
in
the
cure
of
disease
as
in
the
cure
of
sin
the
more
excellent
way
is
divine
science
in
every
case
is
a
science
or
a
bundle
of
speculative
human
theories
the
prescription
which
succeeds
in
one
stance
fails
in
another
and
this
is
owing
to
the
different
mental
states
of
the
patient
these
states
are
not
prehended
and
they
are
left
without
explanation
except
in
christian
science
the
rule
and
its
perfection
of
tion
never
vary
in
science
if
you
fail
to
succeed
in
any
case
it
is
because
you
have
not
demonstrated
the
life
of
christ
truth
more
in
your
own
life
because
you
have
not
obeyed
the
rule
and
proved

physician
a
physician
of
the
old
school
remarked
with
great
gravity
we
know
that
mind
affects
the
body
what
and
advise
our
patients
to
be
hopeful
and
cheerful
and
to
take
as
little
medicine
as
possible
but
mind
can
never
cure
organic
difficulties
the
logic
is
lame
and
facts
contradict
it
the
author
has
cured
what
is
termed
organic
disease
as
readily
as
she
has
cured
purely
functional
disease
and
with
no
power
but
the
divine
mind
tests
in
our
day
since
god
divine
mind
governs
all
not
partially
but
supremely
predicting
disease
does
not
dignify

whatever
guides

benefits
mind
and

we
need
to
understand
the
affirmations
of
divine
science
dismiss
superstition
and
demonstrate
truth
according
to
christ
there
is
hardly
a
city
village
or
hamlet
in
which
are
not
to
be
found
living
witnesses
and
monuments
to
the
virtue
and
power
of
truth
as
applied
through
this
christian
system
of
healing
disease
the
main
purpose
the
healing
power
of
truth
is
widely
strated
as
an
immanent
eternal
science
instead
of
a
phenomenal
exhibition
its
appearing
is
the
coming
anew
of
the
gospel
of
on
earth
peace
toward
men
this
coming
as
was
promised
by
the
master
is
for
its
establishment
as
a
permanent
dispensation
among
men
but
the
mission
of
christian
science
now
as
in
the
time
of
its
earlier
demonstration
is
not
primarily
one
of
physical
healing
now
as
then
signs
and
wonders
are
wrought
in
the
metaphysical
ing
of
physical
disease
but
these
signs
are
only
to
strate
its
divine
origin
to
attest
the
reality
of
the
higher
mission
of
the

take
away
the
sins
of
the

doctrine
the
science
of
physics
would
have
one
lieve
that
both
matter
and
mind
are
subject
to
disease
and
that
too
in
spite
of
the
individual
test
and
contrary
to
the
law
of
divine
mind
this
human
view
infringes
man
free
moral
agency
and
it
is
as
evidently
erroneous
to
the
author
and
will
be
to
all
others
at
some
future
day
as
the
practically
rejected
doctrine
of
the
predestination
of
souls
to
damnation
or
salvation
the
doctrine
that

is
erned
by

all
his

that

thrust
out

because
they
are
ignorant
that
the
human

are
myths
to
be
sure
they
sometimes
treat
the

as
if
there
was
but
one
factor
in
the
case
but
this
one
factor
they
represent
to
be

not
mind
infinite
mind
could
not
possibly
create
a
remedy
outside
of
itself
but
erring
finite
human
mind
has
an
absolute
need
of
something
beyond
itself
for
its
redemption
and
healing
intentions
respected
great
respect
is
due
the
motives
and
philanthropy
of
the
higher
class
of

we

of
the
enlarged
power
it
confers
to
benefit
the
race
physically

spiritually
they
would
rejoice
with
us
even
this
one
reform
in

would
ultimately
deliver
mankind
from
the
awful
and

bondage
now
enforced
by
false

from
which
multitudes
would
gladly
escape

the

the

the

be
put
off
as
paul
declares
all
that

is
the

and
its

and
in
this

the

mortal

dethroned
that
mortal

claims
to
govern
every

of

we
have
overwhelming
proof
but
this
called
mind
is
a
myth
and
must
by
its
own
consent
yield
to
truth
it
would
wield
the
sceptre
of

but
it
is
powerless
the
immortal

away
all
its
supposed
sovereignty
and

the
author
has
endeavored
to
make
this
book
the
aesculapius
of
mind
as
well
as
of
body
that
it
may
give
hope
to
the
sick
and
heal
them
although
they
know
not
how
the
work
is
done
truth
has
a
healing
effect
even
when
not
fully
understood
all
activity
from
thought
anatomy
describes
muscular
action
as
produced
by
mind
in
one
instance
and
not
in
another
such
errors
beset
every
material
theory
in
which
one
statement
contradicts
another
over
and
over
again
it
is
related
that
sir
humphry
davy
once
parently
cured
a
case
of
paralysis
simply
by
introducing
a
thermometer
into
the
patient
mouth
this
he
did
merely
to
ascertain
the
temperature
of
the
patient
body
but
the
sick
man
supposed
this
ceremony
was
intended
to
heal
him
and
he
recovered
accordingly
such
a
fact
illustrates
our
theories
the
author
experiments
in
medicine
the
author
medical
researches
and
experiments
had
prepared
her
thought
for
the
metaphysics
of
christian
science
every
material
dependence
had
failed
her
in
her
search
for
truth
and
she
can
now
understand
why
and
can
see
the
means
by
which
mortals
are
divinely
driven
to
a
spiritual

for
health
and

homoeopathic
attenuations
her
experiments
in
homoeopathy
had
made
her
tical
as
to
material
curative
methods
jahr
from
to
enumerates
the
general
symptoms
the
characteristic
signs
which
demand
different
remedies
but
the
drug
is
frequently
attenuated
to
such
a
degree
that
not
a
tige
of
it
remains
thus
we
learn
that
it
is
not
the
drug
which
expels
the
disease
or
changes
one
of
the
symptoms
of
disease
only
salt
and
water
the
author
has
attenuated
mon
until
there
was
not
a
single
saline
property
left
the
salt
had
lost
his
savour
and
yet
with
one
drop
of
that
attenuation
in
a
goblet
of
water
and
a
teaspoonful
of
the
water
administered
at
tervals
of
three
hours
she
has
cured

in
the
last
stage
of
typhoid
fever
the
highest
attenuation
of
homoeopathy
and
the
most
potent
rises
above
matter
into
mind
this
discovery
leads
to
more
light
from
it
may
be
learned
that
either
human
faith
or
the
divine
mind
is
the
healer
and
that
there
is
no
efficacy
in
a
drug
origin
of
pain
you
say
a
boil
is
painful
but
that
is
impossible
for
matter
without
mind
is
not
painful
the
boil
simply
manifests
through
inflammation
and
ing
a
belief
in
pain
and
this
belief
is
called
a
boil
now
administer
mentally
to
your
patient
a
high
attenuation
of
truth
and
it
will
soon
cure
the
boil
the
fact
that
pain
can
not
exist
where
there
is
no
mortal
mind
to
feel
it
is
a
proof
that
this
mind
makes
its
own
pain
that
is
its
own
in
pain
source
of
contagion
we
weep
because
others
weep
we
yawn
because
they
yawn
and
we
have
smallpox
because
others
have
it
but
mortal
mind
not
matter
contains
and
carries
the
infection
when
this
mental
contagion
is
understood
we
shall
be
more
careful
of
our
mental
ditions
and
we
shall
avoid
loquacious
tattling
about
disease
as
we
would
avoid
advocating
crime
neither
sympathy
nor
society
should
ever
tempt
us
to
cherish
error
in
any
form
and
certainly
we
should
not
be
advocate
disease
arises
like
other
mental
conditions
from
sociation
since
it
is
a
law
of
mortal
mind
that
certain
diseases
should
be
regarded
as
contagious
this
law
tains
credit
through
association
calling
up
the
fear
that
creates
the
image
of
disease
and
its
consequent
tation
in
the
body
imaginary
cholera
this
fact
in
metaphysics
is
illustrated
by
the
following
incident
a
man
was
made
to
believe
that
he
occupied
a
bed
where
a
cholera
patient
had
died
diately
the
symptoms
of
this
disease
appeared
and
the
man
died
the
fact
was
that
he
had
not
caught
the
cholera
by
material
contact
because
no
cholera
patient
had
been
in
that
bed
children
ailments
if
a
child
is
exposed
to
contagion
or
infection
the
mother
is
frightened
and
says
my
child
will
be
sick
the
law
of
mortal
mind
and
her
own
fears
ern
her
child
more
than
the
child
mind
erns
itself
and
they
produce
the
very
results
which
might
have
been
prevented
through
the
opposite
understanding
then
it
is
believed
that
exposure
to
the
contagion
wrought
the
mischief
that
mother
is
not
a
christian
scientist
and
her
tions
need
better
guidance
who
says
to
her
child

it

dropsy
cured

a

of
dropsy
given
up
by
the
faculty
fell
into
my
hands
it
was
a
terrible
case
tapping
had
been
employed
and
yet
as
she
lay
in
her
bed
the
patient
looked
like
a
barrel
i
prescribed
the
fourth
attenuation
of
with
sional
doses
of
a
high
attenuation
of
she
proved
perceptibly
believing
then
somewhat
in
the
ordinary
theories
of
medical
practice
and
learning
that
her
former
physician
had
prescribed
these
remedies
i
began
to
fear
an
aggravation
of
symptoms
from
their
prolonged
use
and
told
the
patient
so
but
she
was
unwilling
to
give
up
the
medicine
while
she
was
covering
it
then
occurred
to
me
to
give
her
medicated
pellets
and
watch
the
result
i
did
so
and
she
continued
to
gain
finally
she
said
that
she
would
give
up
her
medicine
for
one
day
and
risk
the
effects
after
trying
this
she
informed
me
that
she
could
get
along
two
days
without
globules
but
on
the
third
day
she
again
suffered
and
was
relieved
by
taking
them
she
went
on
in
this
way
taking
the
unmedicated
pellets
and
receiving
occasional
visits
from
me
but
employing
no
other
means
and
she
was
cured
a
stately
advance
metaphysics
as
taught
in
christian
science
is
the
next
stately
step
beyond
homoeopathy
in
metaphysics
matter
disappears
from
the
remedy
entirely
and
mind
takes
its
rightful
and
supreme
place
homoeopathy
takes
mental
symptoms
largely
into
consideration
in
its
diagnosis
of
disease
christian
science
deals
wholly
with
the
mental
cause
in
judging
and
destroying
disease
it
succeeds
where
homoeopathy
fails
solely
because
its
one
recognized
principle
of
healing
is
mind
and
the
whole
force
of
the
mental
element
is
ployed
through
the
science
of
mind
which
never
shares
its
rights
with
inanimate
matter
the
modus
of
homoeopathy
christian
science
exterminates
the
drug
and
rests
on
mind
alone
as
the
curative
principle
acknowledging
that
the
divine
mind
has
all
power
homoeopathy
mentalizes
a
drug
with
such
repetition
of
that
the
drug
becomes
more
like
the
human
mind
than
the
substratum
of
this
called
mind
which
we
call
matter
and
the
drug
power
of
action
is
proportionately
increased
drugging
unchristian
if
drugs
are
part
of
god
creation
which
according
to
the
narrative
in
genesis
he
then
drugs
can
not
be
poisonous
if
he
could
ate
drugs
intrinsically
bad
then
they
should
never
be
used
if
he
creates
drugs
at
all
and
designs
them
for
medical
use
why
did
jesus
not
employ
them
and
recommend
them
for
the
treatment
of

matter
is
not

possess

quiet
mortal

and
so
relieve
the

but
they
leave
both

and

worse
for
this

christian
science
impresses
the
entire
ality
namely
mind
and
body
and
brings
out
the
proof
that
life
is
continuous
and
harmonious

both
neutralizes
error
and
destroys
it
mankind
is
the
better
for
this
spiritual
and
profound
pathology
mythology
and
materia

it
is
recorded
that
the
profession
of
medicine
originated
in
idolatry
with
pagan
priests
who
besought
the
gods
to
heal
the
sick
and
designated
apollo
as
the
god
of
medicine
he
was
supposed
to
have
tated
the
first
prescription
according
to
the
history
of
four
thousand
years
of
medicine
it
is
here
noticeable
that
apollo
was
also
regarded
as
the
sender
of
disease
the
god
of
pestilence
hippocrates
turned
from
to
vegetable
and
mineral
drugs
for
ing
this
was
deemed
progress
in
medicine
but
what
we
need
is
the
truth
which
heals
both
mind
and
body
the
future
history
of
material
medicine
may
correspond
with
that
of
its
material
god
apollo
who
was
banished
from

and
endured
great
sufferings
upon

drugs
cataplasms
and
whiskey
are
stupid
substitutes
for
the
dignity
and

of

and
its
cacy
to
heal
it
is
pitiful
to
lead
men
into
temptation
through
the
byways
of
this
derness
world
to
victimize
the
race
with
intoxicating
prescriptions
for
the

mortal

acquires
an
educated
appetite
for
strong

become

homoeopathy
a

this

died
in

although
her
cians
insisted
that
it
would
be
unsafe
to
perform
a
needed
surgical
operation
without
the
ether
after
the
autopsy
her
sister
testified
that
the
deceased
protested
against
inhaling
the
ether
and
said
it
would
kill
her
but
that
she
was
compelled
by
her
physicians
to
take
it
her
hands
were
held
and
she
was
forced
into
mission
the
case
was
brought
to
trial
the
evidence
was
found
to
be
conclusive
and
a
verdict
was
returned
that
death
was
occasioned
not
by
the
ether
but
by
fear
of
inhaling
it
mental
conditions
to
be
heeded
is
it
skilful
or
scientific
surgery
to
take
no
heed
of
tal
conditions
and
to
treat
the
patient
as
if
she
were
so
much
mindless
matter
and
as
if
matter
were
the
only
factor
to
be
consulted
had
these
unscientific
surgeons
understood
metaphysics
they
would
have
considered
the

and
not
have
risked
such
treatment
they
would
either
have
allayed
her
fear
or
would
have
performed
the
tion
without
ether
the
sequel
proved
that
this
lynn
woman
died
from
effects
produced
by
mortal
mind
and
not
from
the
disease
or
the
operation
false

has

rebel
against

it
closed

man
not

to

intellectual

by
the
size
of
the
brain
and
strength
by
the
exercise
of

is
to
subjugate
intelligence
to
make

and
to
place
this
mind
at
the
mercy
of
material
organization
and
matter
obedience
to
the
physical

of
health
has
not
checked

diseases
have

since
material
theories
took
the
place
of
spiritual
truth
causes
of
sickness
you
say
that
indigestion
fatigue
sleeplessness
cause
distressed
stomachs
and
aching
heads
then
you
consult
your
brain
in
order
to
remember
what
has
hurt
you
when
your
remedy
lies
in
forgetting
the
whole
thing
for
matter
has
no
sensation
of
its
own
and
the
human
mind
is
all
that
can
produce
pain
as
a
man
thinketh
so
is
he
mind
is
all
that
feels
acts
or
impedes
action
ignorant
of
this
or
shrinking
from
its
implied
responsibility
the
healing
effort
is
made
on
the
wrong
side
and
thus
the
conscious
control
over
the

is
lost
delusions
pagan
and
medical
the
mohammedan
believes
in
a
pilgrimage
to
mecca
for
the
salvation
of
his
soul
the
popular
doctor
believes
in
his
prescription
and
the
pharmacist
believes
in
the
power
of
his
drugs
to
save
a
life
the
mohammedan
belief
is
a
religious
delusion
the
doctor
and
pharmacist
is
a
medical
mistake
health
from
reliance
on
spirituality
the
erring
human
mind
is
inharmonious
in
itself
from
it
arises
the
inharmonious
body
to
ignore
god
as
of
little
use
in
sickness
is
a
mistake
instead
of
thrusting
him
aside
in
times
of
bodily
trouble
and
waiting
for
the
hour
of
strength
in
which
to
acknowledge
him
we
should
learn
that
he
can
do
all
things
for
us
in
sickness
as
in
health
failing
to
recover
health
through
adherence
to
ology
and
hygiene
the
despairing
invalid
often
drops
them
and
in
his
extremity
and
only
as
a
last
resort
turns
to
god
the
invalid
faith
in
the
divine
mind
is
less
than
in
drugs
air
and
exercise
or
he
would
have
resorted
to
mind
first
the
balance
of
power
is
conceded
to
be
with
matter
by
most
of
the
medical
systems
but
when
mind
at
last
asserts
its
mastery
over
sin
disease
and
death
then
is
man
found
to
be
harmonious
and
immortal
should
we
implore
a
corporeal
god
to
heal
the
sick
out
of
his
personal
volition
or
should
we
understand
the
infinite
divine
principle
which
heals
if
we
rise
no
higher
than
blind
faith
the
science
of
healing
is
not
attained
and
in
the
place
of
is
not
prehended
we
apprehend
life
in
divine
science
only
as
we
live
above
corporeal
sense
and
correct
it
our
portionate
admission
of
the
claims
of
good
or
of
evil
termines
the
harmony
of
our
existence
our
health
our
longevity
and
our
christianity
the
two
masters
we
can
not
serve
two
masters
nor
perceive
divine
ence
with
the
material
senses
drugs
and
hygiene
can
not
successfully
usurp
the
place
and
power
of
the
divine
source
of
all
health
and
perfection
if
god
made
man
both
good
and
evil
man
must
remain
thus
what
can
improve
god
work
again
an
error
in
the
premise
must
appear
in
the
conclusion
to
have
one
god
and
avail
yourself
of
the
power
of
spirit
you
must
love
god
supremely
success
the
flesh
lusteth
against
the
spirit
the
flesh
and
spirit
can
no
more
unite
in
action
than
good
can
cide
with
evil
it
is
not
wise
to
take
a
ing
and
position
or
to
expect
to
work
equally
with
spirit
and
matter
truth
and
error
there
is
but
one
way
namely
god
and
his
idea
which
leads
to
spiritual
being
the
scientific
government
of
the
body
must
be
attained
through
the
divine
mind
it
is
possible
to
gain
control
over
the
body
in
any
other
way
on
this
fundamental
point
timid
conservatism
is
lutely
inadmissible
only
through
radical
reliance
on
truth
can
scientific
healing
power
be
realized
substituting
good
words
for
a
good
life
fair
seeming
for
straightforward
character
is
a
poor
shift
for
the
weak
and
worldly
who
think
the
standard
of
christian
science
too
high
for
them
belief
on
the
wrong
side
if
the
scales
are
evenly
adjusted
the
removal
of
a
single
weight
from
either
scale
gives
preponderance
to
the
site
whatever
influence
you
cast
on
the
side
of
matter
you
take
away
from
mind
which
would
otherwise
outweigh
all
else
your
belief
militates
against
your
health
when
it
ought
to
be
enlisted
on
the
side
of
health
when
sick
according
to
belief
you
rush
after
drugs
search
out
the
material
laws
of
health
and
depend
upon
them
to
heal
you
though
you
have
already
brought
yourself
into
the
slough
of
disease
through
just
this
false
belief
the
divine
authority
because
systems
insist
that
man
becomes
sick
and
useless
suffers
and
dies
all
in
consonance
with
the
laws
of
god
are
we
to
believe
it
are
we
to
believe
an
authority
which
denies
spiritual
command
relating
to
perfection
an
authority
which
jesus
proved
to
be
false
he
did
the
will
of
the
father
he
healed
sickness
in
defiance
of
what
is
called
material
law
but
in
accordance
with
god
law
the
law
of
mind
disease
foreseen
i
have
discerned
disease
in
the
human
mind
and
ognized
the
patient
fear
of
it
months
before
the
disease
made
its
appearance
in
the

ease
being
a
belief
a
latent
illusion
of
mortal
mind
the

would
not

the

and
destroyed
by

changed

here
let
a
word
be
noticed
which
will
be
better
understood
hereafter
by
chemicalization
i
mean
the
process
which
mortal
mind
and
body
undergo
in
the
change
of
belief
from
a
material
to
a
spiritual
basis
scientific
foresight
whenever
an
aggravation
of
symptoms
has
occurred
through
mental
chemicalization
i
have
seen
the
mental
signs
assuring
me
that
danger
was
over
before
the
patient
felt
the
change
and
i
have
said
to
the
patient
you
are
healed
sometimes
to
his
comfiture
when
he
was
incredulous
but
it
always
came
about
as
i
had
foretold
i
name
these
facts
to
show
that
disease
has
a
mental
mortal
origin
that
faith
in
rules
of
health
or
in
drugs
begets
and
fosters
disease
by
attracting
the
mind
to
the
subject
of
sickness
by
exciting
fear
of
disease
and
by
ing
the
body
in
order
to
avoid
it
the
faith
reposed
in
these
things
should
find
stronger
supports
and
a
higher
home
if
we
understood
the
control
of
mind
over
body
we
should
put
no
faith
in
material
means
mind
the
only
healer
science
not
only
reveals
the
origin
of
all
disease
as
mental
but
it
also
declares
that
all
disease
is
cured
by
divine
mind
there
can
be
no
healing
cept
by
this
mind
however
much
we
trust
a
drug
or
any
other
means
towards
which
human
faith
or
endeavor
is
directed
it
is
mortal
mind
not
ter
which
brings
to
the
sick
whatever
good
they
may
seem
to
receive
from
materiality
but
the
sick
are
never
really
healed
except
by
means
of
the
divine
power
only
the
action
of
truth
life
and
love
can
give
harmony
modes
of

whatever
teaches
man
to
have
other
laws
and
to
acknowledge
other
powers
than
the
divine
mind
is
the
good
that
a
poisonous
drug
seems
to
do
is
evil
for
it
robs
man
of
reliance
on

omnipotent

and
according
to

the

neither
a
moral

the
discord
which

is
the
result
of
the
exercise
of
faith
in
material
modes
faith
in

instead
of
in

physiology
unscientific
did
jesus
understand
the

spiritual

the

seems
ready
to
approach
this
subject
to
ponder
somewhat
the
supremacy
of
spirit
and
at
least
to
touch
the
hem
of
truth
garment
the
description
of
man
as
purely
physical
or
as
both
material
and
spiritual
but
in
either
case
dependent
upon
his
physical
organization
is
the
pandora
box
from
which
all
ills
have
gone
forth
especially
despair
matter
which
takes
divine
power
into
its
own
hands
and
claims
to
be
a
creator
is
a
fiction
in
which
paganism
and
lust
are
so
sanctioned
by

that
mankind

caught
their
moral
contagion
paradise

through

man
will
reopen
with
the
key
of
divine

the
gates
of
paradise
which
human
beliefs
have
closed

will
find
himself
unfallen
upright
pure

not

either
of

mind
control

no

an
open

jesus
illustrated
the

principle
and
the
power
of

by
healing

destroying
the

the

between

the

of

are
nothing
but
false
liefs
that
intelligence

are
present
where
mind

these
false

the
procuring

the
opposite
truth
that

the
fundamental
error
lies
in
the

that
the

godless

nothing
in

and
very
much
in
the
wrong
materialism
grades
the
human
species
as
rising
from
matter
upward
how
then
is
the
material
species
tained
if
man
passes
through
what
we
call
death
and
death
is
the
rubicon
of
spirituality
spirit
can
form
no
real
link
in
this
supposed
chain
of
material
being
but
divine
science
reveals
the
eternal
chain
of
existence
as
uninterrupted
and
wholly
spiritual
yet
this
can
be
realized
only
as
the
false
sense
of
being
disappears
degrees
of

if
man
was

a

he
must
have

to
become

he

the

in
the
mortal
human
mind
and
its
cure
comes
from
the
immortal
divine
mind
we
should
prevent
the
images
of
disease
from
taking
form
in
thought
and
we
should
efface
the
outlines
of
disease
already
formulated
in
the
minds
of
mortals
novel
diseases
when
there
are
fewer
prescriptions
and
less
thought
is
given
to
sanitary
subjects
there
will
be
better
constitutions
and
less
disease
in
old
times
who
ever
heard
of
dyspepsia
meningitis
and
what
an
abuse
of
natural
beauty
to
say
that
a
rose
the
smile
of
god
can
produce
suffering
the
joy
of
its
presence
its
beauty
and
fragrance
should
uplift
the
thought
and
dissuade
any
sense
of
fear
or
fever
it
is
profane
to
fancy
that
the
perfume
of
clover
and
the
breath
of
hay
can
cause
glandular
inflammation
sneezing
and
nasal
pangs
no
ancestral
dyspepsia
if
a
random
thought
calling
itself
dyspepsia
had
tried
to
tyrannize
over
our
forefathers
it
would
have
been
routed
by
their
independence
and
dustry
then
people
had
less
time
for
ishness
coddling
and
sickly
talk
the
act
amount
of
food
the
stomach
could
digest
was
not
discussed
according
to
cutter
nor
referred
to
sanitary
laws
a
man
belief
in
those
days
was
not
so
severe
upon
the
gastric
juices
beaumont
medical
ments
did
not
govern
the
digestion
pulmonary
misbeliefs
damp
atmosphere
and
freezing
snow
empurpled
the
plump
cheeks
of
our
ancestors
but
they
never
indulged
in
the
refinement
of
inflamed
bronchial
tubes
they
were
as
innocent
as
adam
before
he
ate
the
fruit
of
false
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
tubercles
and
troches
lungs
and
lozenges
our
modern
eves
where
ignorance
is
bliss
is
folly
to
be
wise
says
the
english
poet
and
there
is
truth
in
his
sentiment
the
action
of
mortal
mind
on
the
body
was
not
so
injurious
before
inquisitive
modern
eves
took
up
the
study
of
medical
works
and
unmanly
adams
attributed
their
own
downfall
and
the
fate
of
their
spring
to
the
weakness
of
their
wives
the
primitive
custom
of
taking
no
thought
about
food
left
the
stomach
and
bowels
free
to
act
in
ence
to
nature
and
gave
the
gospel
a
chance
to
be
seen
in
its
glorious
effects
upon
the
body
a
ghastly
array
of
diseases
was
not
paraded
before
the
imagination
there
were
fewer
books
on
digestion
and
more
sermons
in
stones
and
good
in
everything
when
the
mechanism
of
the
human
mind
gives
place
to
the
divine
mind
ishness
and
sin
disease
and
death
will
lose
their
foothold
human
fear
of
miasma
would
load
with
disease
the
air
of
eden
and
weigh
down
mankind
with
superimposed
and
conjectural
evils
mortal
mind
is
the
worst
foe
of
the
body
while
divine
mind
is
its
best
friend
diseases
not
to
be
classified
should
all
cases
of
organic
disease
be
treated
by
a
regular
practitioner
and
the
christian
scientist
try
truth
only
in
cases
of
hysteria
dria
and
hallucination
one
disease
is
no
more
real
than
another
all
disease
is
the
result
of
education
and
disease
can
carry
its
no
farther
than
mortal
mind
maps
out
the
way
the
human
mind
not
matter
is
supposed
to
feel
suffer
joy
hence
decided
types
of
acute
disease
are
quite
as
ready
to
yield
to
truth
as
the
less
distinct
type
and
chronic
form
of
disease
truth
handles
the
most
malignant
tagion
with
perfect
assurance
one
basis
for
all
sickness
human
mind
produces
what
is
termed
organic
ease
as
certainly
as
it
produces
hysteria
and
it
must
linquish
all
its
errors
sicknesses
and
sins
i
have
demonstrated
this
beyond
all
cavil
the
evidence
of
divine
mind
healing
power
and
lute
control
is
to
me
as
certain
as
the
evidence
of
my
own
existence
mental
and
physical
oneness
mortal
mind
and
body
are
one
neither
exists
without
the
other
and
both
must
be
destroyed
by
immortal
mind
matter
or
body
is
but
a
false
concept
of
tal
mind
this
mind
builds
its
own
superstructure
of
which
the
material
body
is
the
grosser
portion
but
from
first
to
last
the
body
is
a
sensuous
human
concept
the
effect
of
names
in
the
scriptural
allegory
of
the
material
creation
adam
or
error
which
represents
the
erroneous
theory
of
life
and
intelligence
in
matter
had
the
naming
of
all
that
was
material
these
names
indicated
matter
properties
qualities
and
forms
but
a
lie
the
opposite
of
truth
can
not
name
the
qualities
and
effects
of
what
is
termed
matter
and
create
the
laws
of
the
flesh
nor
can
a

preponderance
of

in

against

poison

if
a
dose
of
poison
is
swallowed
through
mistake
and
the
patient
dies
even
though
physician
and
patient
are
expecting
favorable
results
does
human
belief
you
ask
cause
this
death
even
so
and
as
directly
as
if
the
poison
had
been
intentionally
taken
in
such
cases
a
few
persons
believe
the
potion
lowed
by
the
patient
to
be
harmless
but
the
vast
jority
of
mankind
though
they
know
nothing
of
this
ticular
case
and
this
special
person
believe
the
arsenic
the
strychnine
or
whatever
the
drug
used
to
be
sonous
for
it
is
set
down
as
a
poison
by
mortal

consequently
the
result
is
controlled
by
the
majority
of
opinions
not
by
the
infinitesimal
minority
of
opinions
in
the
heredity
is
not
a
law
the
remote
cause
or
belief
of
disease
is
not
dangerous
because
of
its
priority
and
the
connection
of
past
mortal
thoughts
with
present
the
predisposing
cause
and
the
exciting
cause
are
mental
perhaps
an
adult
has
a
deformity
produced
prior
to
his
birth
by
the
fright
of
his
mother
when
wrested
from
human
belief
and
based
on
science
or
the
divine
mind
to
which
all
things
are
possible
that
chronic
case
is
not
difficult
to
cure
animal
magnetism
destroyed
mortal
mind
acting
from
the
basis
of
sensation
in
matter
is
animal
magnetism
but
this
mind
from
which
comes
all
evil
contradicts
itself
and
must
finally
yield
to
the
eternal
truth
or
the
divine
mind
expressed
in
science
in
portion
to
our
understanding
of
christian
science
we
are
freed
from
the
belief
of
heredity
of
mind
in
matter
or
mal
magnetism
and
we
disarm
sin
of
its
imaginary
power
in
proportion
to
our
spiritual
understanding
of
the
status
of
immortal
being
ignorant
of
the
methods
and
the
basis
of
metaphysical
healing
you
may
attempt
to
unite
with
it
hypnotism
spiritualism
electricity
but
none
of
these
methods
can
be
mingled
with
metaphysical
healing
whoever
reaches
the
understanding
of
christian
science
in
its
proper
signification
will
perform
the
sudden
cures
of
which
it
is
capable
but
this
can
be
done
only
by
taking
up
the
cross
and
following
christ
in
the
daily
life
absent
patients
science
can
heal
the
sick
who
are
absent
from
their
healers
as
well
as
those
present
since
space
is
no
stacle
to
mind
immortal
mind
heals
what
eye
hath
not
seen
but
the
spiritual
capacity
to
prehend
thought
and
to
heal
by
the
is
won
only
as
man
is
found
not
in
but
flecting
the
divine
nature
horses
mistaught
every
medical
method
has
its
advocates
the
ence
of
mortal
mind
for
a
certain
method
creates
a
demand
for
that
method
and
the
body
then
seems
to
quire
such
treatment
you
can
even
educate
a
healthy
horse
so
far
in
physiology
that
he
will
take
cold
without
his
blanket
whereas
the
wild
animal
left
to
his
instincts
sniffs
the
wind
with
delight
the
epizootic
is
a
humanly
evolved
ailment
which
a
wild
horse
might
never
have
medical
works
objectionable
treatises
on
anatomy
physiology
and
health
sustained
by
what
is
termed
material
law
are
the
moters
of
sickness
and
disease
it
should
not
be
proverbial
that
so
long
as
you
read
medical
works
you
will
be
sick
the
sedulous
matron
studying
her
jahr
with
opathic
pellet
and
powder
in
hand
ready
to
put
you
into
a
sweat
to
move
the
bowels
or
to
produce
sleep
is
unwittingly
sowing
the
seeds
of
reliance
on
matter
and
her
household
may
erelong
reap
the
effect
of
this
mistake
descriptions
of
disease
given
by
physicians
and
tisements
of
quackery
are
both
prolific
sources
of
sickness
as
mortal
mind
is
the
husbandman
of
error
it
should
be
taught
to
do
the
body
no
harm
and
to
uproot
its
false
sowing
the
invalid
outlook
the
patient
sufferer
tries
to
be
satisfied
when
he
sees
his
healers
busy
and
his
faith
in
their
efforts
is
somewhat
helpful
to
them
and
to
himself
but
in
science
one
must
understand
the
tating
law
of
life
this
is
the
seed
within
itself
bearing
fruit
after
its
kind
spoken
of
in
genesis
physicians
should
not
deport
themselves
as
if
mind
were
nor
take
the
ground
that
all
causation
is
matter
instead
of
mind
ignorant
that
the
human
mind
governs
the
body
its
phenomenon
the
invalid
may
unwittingly
add
more
fear
to
the
mental
reservoir
already
overflowing
with
that
emotion
wrong
and
right
way
doctors
should
not
implant
disease
in
the
thoughts
of
their
patients
as
they
so
frequently
do
by
declaring
ease
to
be
a
fixed
fact
even
before
they
go
to
work
to
eradicate
the
disease
through
the
terial
faith
which
they
inspire
instead
of
furnishing
thought
with
fear
they
should
try
to
correct
this
turbulent
element
of
mortal
mind
by
the
influence
of
divine
love
which
casteth
out
fear
when
man
is
governed
by
god
the
mind
who
understands
all
things
man
knows
that
with
god
all
things
are
possible
the
only
way
to
this
living
truth
which
heals
the
sick
is
found
in
the
science
of
divine
mind
as
taught
and
demonstrated
by
christ
jesus
the
important
decision
to
reduce
inflammation
dissolve
a
tumor
or
cure
ganic
disease
i
have
found
divine
truth
more
potent
than
all
lower
remedies
and
why
not
since
mind
god
is
the
source
and
condition
of
all
existence
before
ing
that
the
body
matter
is
disordered
one
should
ask
who
art
thou
that
repliest
to
spirit
can
matter
speak
for
itself
or
does
it
hold
the
issues
of
life
matter
which
can
neither
suffer
nor
enjoy
has
no
partnership
with
pain
and
ure
but
mortal
belief
has
such
a
partnership
manipulation
unscientific
when
you
manipulate
patients
you
trust
in
electricity
and
magnetism
more
than
in
truth
and
for
that
reason
you
employ
matter
rather
than
mind
you
weaken
or
destroy
your
power
when
you
sort
to
any
except
spiritual
means
it
is
foolish
to
declare
that
you
manipulate
patients
but
that
you
lay
no
stress
on
manipulation
if
this
be
so
why
manipulate
in
reality
you
manipulate
because
you
are
ignorant
of
the
baneful
effects
of
magnetism
or
are
not
sufficiently
spiritual
to
depend
on
spirit
in
either
case
you
must
improve
your
mental
condition
till
you
finally
attain
the
understanding
of
christian
science
not
words
but
deeds
if
you
are
too
material
to
love
the
science
of
mind
and
are
satisfied
with
good
words
instead
of
effects
if
you
adhere
to
error
and
are
afraid
to
trust
truth
the
question
then
recurs
adam
where
art
thou
it
is
unnecessary
to
resort
to
aught
besides
mind
in
order
to
satisfy
the
sick
that
you
are
doing
thing
for
them
for
if
they
are
cured
they
generally
know
it
and
are
satisfied
where
your
treasure
is
there
will
your
heart
be
also
if
you
have
more
faith
in
drugs
than
in
truth
this
faith
will
incline
you
to
the
side
of
matter
and
error
any
hypnotic
power
you
may
exercise
will
diminish
your
ability
to
become
a
scientist
and
the
act
of
healing
the
sick
through
divine
mind
alone
of
casting
out
error
with
truth
shows
your
position
as
a
christian
scientist
physiology
or
spirit
the
demands
of
god
appeal
to
thought
only
but
the
claims
of
mortality
and
what
are
termed
laws
of
nature
appertain
to
matter
which
then
are
we
to
accept
as
legitimate
and
capable
of
producing
the
highest
human
good
we
can
not
obey
both
ology
and
spirit
for
one
absolutely
destroys
the
other
and
one
or
the
other
must
be
supreme
in
the
affections
it
is
impossible
to
work
from
two
standpoints
if
we
attempt
it
we
shall
presently
hold
to
the
one
and
despise
the
other
the
hypotheses
of
mortals
are
antagonistic
to
science
and
can
not
mix
with
it
this
is
clear
to
those
who
heal
the
sick
on
the
basis
of
science
no
material
law
mind
government
of
the
body
must
supersede
the
called
laws
of
matter
obedience
to
material
law
vents
full
obedience
to
spiritual
law
the
law
which
overcomes
material
conditions
and
puts
matter
under
the
feet
of
mind
mortals
entreat
the
vine
mind
to
heal
the
sick
and
forthwith
shut
out
the
aid
of
mind
by
using
material
means
thus
working
against
themselves
and
their
prayers
and
denying
man
given
ability
to
demonstrate
mind
sacred
power
pleas
for
drugs
and
laws
of
health
come
from
some
sad
incident
or
else
from
ignorance
of
christian
science
and
its
scendent
power
to
admit
that
sickness
is
a
condition
over
which
god
has
no
control
is
to
presuppose
that
omnipotent
power
is
powerless
on
some
occasions
the
law
of
christ
or
truth
makes
all
things
possible
to
spirit
but
the
called
laws
of
matter
would
render
spirit
of
no
avail
and
demand
obedience
to
materialistic
codes
thus
departing
from
the
basis
of
one
god
one
lawmaker
to
suppose
that
god
constitutes
laws
of
inharmony
is
a
mistake
cords
have
no
support
from
nature
or
divine
law
however
much
is
said
to
the
contrary
can
the
agriculturist
according
to
belief
produce
a
crop
without
sowing
the
seed
and
awaiting
its
tion
according
to
the
laws
of
nature
the
answer
is
no
and
yet
the
scriptures
inform
us
that
sin
or
error
first
caused
the
condemnation
of
man
to
till
the
ground
and
indicate
that
obedience
to
god
will
remove
this
necessity
truth
never
made
error
necessary
nor
devised
a
law
to
perpetuate
error
laws
of
nature
spiritual
the
supposed
laws
which
result
in
weariness
and
ease
are
not
his
laws
for
the
legitimate
and
only
possible
action
of
truth
is
the
production
of
harmony
laws
of
nature
are
laws
of
spirit
but
mortals
commonly
recognize
as
law
that
which
hides
the
power
of
spirit
divine
mind
rightly
demands
man
entire
dience
affection
and
strength
no
reservation
is
made
for
any
lesser
loyalty
obedience
to
truth
gives
man
power
and
strength
submission
to
error
superinduces
loss
of
power
belief
and
understanding
truth
casts
out
all
evils
and
materialistic
methods
with
the
actual
spiritual
law
the
law
which
gives
sight
to
the
blind
hearing
to
the
deaf
voice
to
the
dumb
feet
to
the
lame
if
christian
science
dishonors
human
belief
it
honors
itual
understanding
and
the
one
mind
only
is
entitled
to
honor
the
laws
of
health
are
simply
laws
of
mortal
belief
the
premises
being
erroneous
the
conclusions
are
wrong
truth
makes
no
laws
to
regulate
sickness
sin
and
death
for
these
are
unknown
to
truth
and
should
not
be
recognized
as
reality
belief
produces
the
results
of
belief
and
the
ties
it
affixes
last
so
long
as
the
belief
and
are
ble
from
it
the
remedy
consists
in
probing
the
trouble
to
the
bottom
in
finding
and
casting
out
by
denial
the
error
of
belief
which
produces
a
mortal
disorder
never
honoring
erroneous
belief
with
the
title
of
law
nor
ing
obedience
to
it
truth
life
and
love
are
the
only
legitimate
and
eternal
demands
on
man
and
they
are
spiritual
lawgivers
enforcing
obedience
through
divine
statutes
laws
of
human
belief
controlled
by
the
divine
intelligence
man
is
ous
and
eternal
whatever
is
governed
by
a
false
belief
is
discordant
and
mortal
we
say
man
suffers
from
the
effects
of
cold
heat
fatigue
this
is
human
belief
not
the
truth
of
being
for
matter
can
not
suffer
mortal
mind
alone
suffers
not
because
a
law
of
matter
has
been
transgressed
but
because
a
law
of
this
mind
has
been
disobeyed
i
have
demonstrated
this
as
a
rule
of
divine
science
by
destroying
the
delusion
of
suffering
from
what
is
termed
a
fatally
broken
physical
law
a

with
great
difficulty
when
the
wind
was
from
the
east
i
sat
silently
by
her
side
a
few
moments
her
breath
came
gently
the
inspirations
were
deep
and
ural
i
then
requested
her
to
look
at
the
she
looked
and
saw
that
it
pointed
due
east
the
wind
had
not
changed
but
her
thought
of
it
had
and
so
her
culty
in
breathing
had
gone
the
wind
had
not
produced
the
difficulty
my
metaphysical
treatment
changed
the
action
of
her
belief
on
the
lungs
and
she
never
suffered
again
from
east
winds
but
was
restored
to
health
a
no
system
of
hygiene
but
christian
science
is
purely
mental
before
this
book
was
published
other
books
were
in
circulation
which
discussed
mental
medicine
and
operating
through
the
power
of
the
earth
magnetic
currents
to
regulate
life
and
health
such
theories
and
such
systems
of
which
have
sprung
up
are
as
material
as
the
prevailing
systems
of
medicine
they
have
their
birth
in
mortal
mind
which
puts
forth
a
human
conception
in
the
name
of
science
to
match
the
divine
science
of
mortal
mind
even
as
the
necromancers
of
egypt
strove
to
emulate
the
wonders
wrought
by
moses
such
theories
have
no
relationship
to
christian
science
which
rests
on
the
conception
of
god
as
the
only
life
substance
and
intelligence
and
excludes
the
human
mind
as
a
spiritual
factor
in
the
healing
work
jesus
and
hypnotism
jesus
cast
out
evil
and
healed
the
sick
not
only
out
drugs
but
without
hypnotism
which
is
the
reverse
of
ethical
and
pathological
power
erroneous
mental
practice
may
seem
for
a
time
to
fit
the
sick
but
the
recovery
is
not
permanent
this
is
because
erroneous
methods
act
on
and
through
the
terial
stratum
of
the
human
mind
called
brain
which
is
but
a
mortal
consolidation
of
material
mentality
and
its
suppositional
activities
false
stimulus
a
patient
under
the
influence
of
mortal
mind
is
healed
only
by
removing
the
influence
on
him
of
this
mind
by
emptying
his
thought
of
the
false
stimulus
and
reaction
of
and
filling
it
with
the
divine
energies
of
truth
christian
science
destroys
material
beliefs
through
the
understanding
of
spirit
and
the
thoroughness
of
this
work
determines
health
erring
human
can
work
only
evil
under
whatever
name
or
pretence
they
are
ployed
for
spirit
and
matter
good
and
evil
light
and
darkness
can
not
mingle
evil
negative
and
evil
is
a
negation
because
it
is
the
absence
of
truth
it
is
nothing
because
it
is
the
absence
of
something
it
is
unreal
because
it
presupposes
the
absence
of
god
the
omnipotent
and
omnipresent
every
mortal
must
learn
that
there
is
neither
power
nor
reality
in
evil
evil
is
it
says
i
am
a
real
entity
mastering
good
this
falsehood
should
strip
evil
of
all
pretensions
the
only
power
of
evil
is
to
destroy
itself
it
can
never
destroy
one
iota
of
good
every
attempt
of
evil
to
destroy
good
is
a
failure
and
only
aids
in
peremptorily
punishing
the
if
we
concede
the
same
reality
to
discord
as
to
harmony
discord
has
as
lasting
a
claim
upon
us
as
has
harmony
if
evil
is
as
real
as
good
evil
is
also
as
immortal
if
death
is
as
real
as
life
immortality
is
a
myth
if
pain
is
as
real
as
the
absence
of
pain
both
must
be
mortal
and
if
so
harmony
can
not
be
the
law
of
being
ignorant
idolatry
mortal
mind
is
ignorant
of
self
or
it
could
never
be
if
mortal
mind
knew
how
to
be
better
it
would
be
better
since
it
must
believe
in
thing
besides
itself
it
enthrones
matter
as
deity
the
human
mind
has
been
an
idolater
from
the
beginning
having
other
gods
and
believing
in
more
than
the
one
mind
as
mortals
do
not
comprehend
even
mortal
existence
how
ignorant
must
they
be
of
the
mind
and
of
his
creations
here
you
may
see
how
material
sense
creates
its
own
forms
of
thought
gives
them
material
names
and
then
worships
and
fears
them
with
pagan
blindness
it
attributes
to
some
material
god
or
medicine
an
ability
beyond
itself
the
beliefs
of
the
human
mind
rob
and
enslave
it
and
then
impute
this
result
to
another
illusive
personification
named
satan
action
of
mortal
mind
the
valves
of
the
heart
opening
and
closing
for
the
sage
of
the
blood
obey
the
mandate
of
tal
mind
as
directly
as
does
the
hand
mittedly
moved
by
the
will
anatomy
allows
the
mental
cause
of
the
latter
action
but
not
of
the
former
we
say
my
hand
hath
done
it
what
is
this
but
mortal
mind
the
cause
of
all
materialistic
action
all
voluntary
as
well
as
miscalled
action
of
the
mortal
body
is
governed
by
this
mind
not
by
matter
there
is
no
involuntary
action
the
divine
mind
includes
all
action
and
volition
and
man
in
science
is
erned
by
this
mind
the
human
mind
tries
to
classify
action
as
voluntary
and
involuntary
and
suffers
from
the
attempt
death
and
the
body
if
you
take
away
this
erring
mind
the
mortal
material
body
loses
all
appearance
of
life
or
action
and
this
called
mind
then
calls
itself
dead
but
the
man
mind
still
holds
in
belief
a
body
through
which
it
acts
and
which
appears
to
the
human
mind
to
live
a
body
like
the
one
it
had
before
death
this
body
is
put
off
only
as
the
mortal
erring
mind
yields
to
god
immortal
mind
and
man
is
found
in
his
image
embryonic
sinful
thoughts
what
is
termed
disease
does
not
exist
it
is
neither
mind
nor
matter
the
belief
of
sin
which
has
grown
terrible
in
strength
and
influence
is
an
scious
error
in
the
beginning
an
embryonic
thought
without
motive
but
afterwards
it
governs
the
man
passion
depraved
appetites
dishonesty
envy
hatred
revenge
ripen
into
action
only
to
pass
from
shame
and
woe
to
their
final
punishment
disease
a
dream
mortal
existence
is
a
dream
of
pain
and
pleasure
in
matter
a
dream
of
sin
sickness
and
death
and
it
is
like
the
dream
we
have
in
sleep
in
which
every
one
recognizes
his
condition
to
be
wholly
a
state
of
mind
in
both
the
waking
and
the
sleeping
dream
the
dreamer
thinks
that
his
body
is
material
and
the
suffering
is
in
that
body
the
smile
of
the
sleeper
indicates
the
sensation
duced
physically
by
the
pleasure
of
a
dream
in
the
same
way
pain
and
pleasure
sickness
and
care
are
traced
upon
mortals
by
unmistakable
signs
sickness
is
a
growth
of
error
springing
from
mortal
ignorance
or
fear
error
rehearses
error
what
causes
disease
can
not
cure
it
the
soil
of
disease
is
mortal
mind
and
you
have
an
abundant
or
scanty
crop
of
disease
according
to
the
seedlings
of
fear
sin
and
the
fear
of
disease
must
be
uprooted
and
cast
out
sense
yields
to
understanding
when
darkness
comes
over
the
earth
the
physical
senses
have
no
immediate
evidence
of
a
sun
the
human
eye
knows
not
where
the
orb
of
day
is
nor
if
it
exists
astronomy
gives
the
desired
information
regarding
the
sun
the
human
or
material
senses
yield
to
the
authority
of
this
science
and
they
are
willing
to
leave
with
astronomy
the
explanation
of
the
sun
influence
over
the
earth
if
the
eyes
see
no
sun
for
a
week
we
still
believe
that
there
is
solar
light
and
heat
science
in
this
instance
named
natural
raises
the
human
thought
above
the
cruder
theories
of
the
human
mind
and
casts
out
a
fear
in
like
manner
mortals
should
no
more
deny
the
power
of
christian
science
to
establish
harmony
and
to
explain
the
effect
of
mortal
mind
on
the
body
though
the
cause
be
unseen
than
they
should
deny
the
existence
of
the
light
when
the
orb
of
day
disappears
or
doubt
that
the
sun
will
reappear
the
sins
of
others
should
not
make
good
men
suffer
ascending
the
scale
we
call
the
body
material
but
it
is
as
truly
mortal
mind
according
to
its
degree
as
is
the
material
brain
which
is
supposed
to
furnish
the
evidence
of
all
mortal
thought
or
things
the
human
mortal
mind
by
an
inevitable
perversion
makes
all
things
start
from
the
lowest
instead
of
from
the
highest
mortal
thought
the
reverse
is
the
case
with
all
the
formations
of
the
immortal
divine
mind
they
proceed
from
the
divine
source
and
so
in
tracing
them
we
stantly
ascend
in
infinite
being
human
reproduction
from
mortal
mind
comes
the
reproduction
of
the
species
first
the
belief
of
inanimate
and
then
of
mate
matter
according
to
mortal
thought
the
development
of
embryonic
mortal
mind
commences
in
the
lower
basal
portion
of
the
brain
and
goes
on
in
an
ascending
scale
by
evolution
keeping
always
in
the
direct
line
of
matter
for
matter
is
the
subjective
condition
of
mortal
mind
next
we
have
the
formation
of
embryonic
mortal
mind
afterwards
mortal
men
or
mortals
all
this
while
matter
is
a
belief
ignorant
of
itself
ignorant
of
what
it
is
supposed
to
produce
the
mortal
says
that
an
mate
unconscious
seedling
is
producing
mortals
both
body
and
mind
and
yet
neither
a
mortal
mind
nor
the
immortal
mind
is
found
in
brain
or
elsewhere
in
matter
or
in
mortals
human
stature
this
embryonic
and
materialistic
human
belief
called
mortal
man
in
turn
fills
itself
with
thoughts
of
pain
and
pleasure
of
life
and
death
and
arranges
itself
into
five
senses
which
presently
measure
mind
by
the
size
of
a
brain
and
the
bulk
of
a
body
called
man
human
frailty
human
birth
growth
maturity
and
decay
are
as
the
grass
springing
from
the
soil
with
beautiful
green
blades
afterwards
to
wither
and
return
to
its
native
nothingness
this
mortal
seeming
is
temporal
it
never
merges
into
immortal
being
but
finally
pears
and
immortal
man
spiritual
and
eternal
is
found
to
be
the
real
man
the
hebrew
bard
swayed
by
mortal
thoughts
thus
swept
his
lyre
with
saddening
strains
on
human
existence
as
for
man
his
days
are
as
grass
as
a
flower
of
the
field
so
he
flourisheth
for
the
wind
passeth
over
it
and
it
is
gone
and
the
place
thereof
shall
know
it
no
more
when
hope
rose
higher
in
the
human
heart
he
sang
as
for
me
i
will
behold
thy
face
in
righteousness
i
shall
be
satisfied
when
i
awake
with
thy
likeness
for
with
thee

the
fountain
of

in
thy
light

the
brain
can
give
no
idea
of

man
it
can
take
no
cognizance
of

matter
is
not
the
organ
of

mortals
give
up
the
delusion
that
there
is
more
than
one

more
than
one
god
man
in

will
appear
and
this

include
in
that

no
material
element
the
immortal
birth
as
a
material
theoretical
is
found
to
be
a
misapprehension
of
existence
the
spiritual
and
divine
principle
of
man
dawns
upon
human
thought
and
leads
it
to
where
the
young
child
was
even
to
the
birth
of
a
idea
to
the
spiritual
sense
of
being
and
of
what
life
includes
this
the
whole
earth
will
be
transformed
by
truth
on
its
pinions
of
light
chasing
away
the
darkness
of
error
spiritual
freedom
the
human
thought
must
free
itself
from
materiality
and
bondage
it
should
no
longer
ask
of
the

what

mind
is

a

within
the
vale
not
a

its
fair
outlines
not
a
flower
starts
from
its
cloistered
cell
the
science
of
being
reveals
man
and
immortality
as
based
on
spirit
physical
sense
defines
mortal
man
as
based
on
matter
and
from
this
premise
infers
the
tality
of
the
body
no
physical
affinity
the
illusive
senses
may
fancy
affinities
with
their
posites
but
in
christian
science
truth
never
mingles
with
error
mind
has
no
affinity
with
matter
and
therefore
truth
is
able
to
cast
out
the
ills
of
the
flesh
mind
god
sends
forth
the
aroma
of

the
atmosphere

the
belief
that
a

is
a
mockery

a
mimicry
of

we
are
christian
scientists
only
as
we
quit
our
reliance
upon
that
which
is
false
and
grasp
the
true
we
are
not
christian
scientists
until
we
leave
all

christ
human
opinions

spiritual
they
come
from

the

of

it

the
headlong

all
that

the

holds

this
teaching

in
science
you
can
have
no

i
was
called
to
visit
clark
in
lynn
who
had
been
confined
to
his
bed
six
months
with
caused
by
a
fall
upon
a
wooden
spike
when
quite
a
boy
on
ing
the
house
i
met
his
physician
who
said
that
the
patient
was
dying
the
physician
had
just
probed
the
ulcer
on
the
hip
and
said
the
bone
was
carious
for
several
inches
he
even
showed
me
the
probe
which
had
on
it
the
evidence
of
this
condition
of
the
bone
the
doctor
went
out
clark
lay
with
his
eyes
fixed
and
sightless
the
dew
of
death
was
on
his
brow
i
went
to
his
bedside
in
a
few
moments
his
face
changed
its
gave
place
to
a
natural
hue
the
eyelids
closed
gently
and
the
breathing
became
natural
he
was
asleep
in
about
ten
minutes
he
opened
his
eyes
and
said
i
feel
like
a
new
man
my
suffering
is
all
gone
it
was
between
three
and
four
in
the
afternoon
when
this
took
place
i
told
him
to
rise
dress
himself
and
take
supper
with
his
family
he
did
so
the
next
day
i
saw
him
in
the
yard
since
then
i
have
not
seen
him
but
am
informed
that
he
went
to
work
in
two
weeks
the
discharge
from
the
sore
stopped
and
the
sore
was
healed
the
diseased
condition
had
continued
there
ever
since
the
injury
was
received
in
boyhood
since
his
recovery
i
have
been
informed
that
his
cian
claims
to
have
cured
him
and
that
his
mother
has
been
threatened
with
incarceration
in
an
insane
asylum
for
saying
it
was
none
other
than
god
and
that
woman
who
healed
him
i
can
not
attest
the
truth
of
that
report
but
what
i
saw
and
did
for
that
man
and
what
his
physician
said
of
the
case
occurred
just
as
i
have
narrated
it
has
been
demonstrated
to
me
that
life
is
god
and
that
the
might
of
omnipotent
spirit
shares
not
its
strength
with
matter
or
with
human
will
ing
this
brief
experience
i
can
not
fail
to
discern
the
coincidence
of
the
spiritual
idea
of
man
with
the
divine
mind
change
of
belief
a
change
in
human
belief
changes
all
the
physical
toms
and
determines
a
case
for
better
or
for
worse
when
one
false
belief
is
corrected
truth
sends
a
report
of
health
over

the
authentic
history
of
kaspar
hauser
is
a
useful
hint
as
to
the
frailty
and
inadequacy
of
mortal
mind
it
proves
beyond
a
doubt
that
education
tutes
this
mind
and
that
in
turn
mortal
mind
manifests
itself
in
the
body
by
the
false
sense
it
imparts
incarcerated
in
a
dungeon
where
neither
sight
nor
sound
could
reach
him
at
the
age
of
seventeen
kaspar
was
still
a
mental
infant
crying
and
chattering
with
no
more
intelligence
than
a
babe
and
realizing
tennyson
description
an
infant
crying
in
the
night
an
infant
crying
for
the
light
and
with
no
language
but
a
cry
his
case
proves
material
sense
to
be
but
a
belief
formed
by
education
alone
the
light
which
affords
us
joy
gave
him
a
belief
of
intense
pain
his
eyes
were
inflamed
by
the
light
after
the
babbling
boy
had
been
taught
to
speak
a
few
words
he
asked
to
be
taken
back
to
his
geon
and
said
that
he
should
never
be
happy
elsewhere
outside
of
dismal
darkness
and
cold
silence
he
found
no
peace
every
sound
convulsed
him
with
anguish
all
that
he
ate
except
his
black
crust
produced
violent
retchings
all
that
gives
pleasure
to
our
educated
senses
gave
him
pain
through
those
very
senses
trained
in
an
opposite
direction
useful
knowledge
the
point
for
each
one
to
decide
is
whether
it
is
mortal
mind
or
immortal
mind
that
is
causative
we
should
forsake
the
basis
of

for
physical
science
and
its

whatever

of

out

that

it
is
the

we
deplore

the
nauseous

for
their
exaggerated

impossible

of

literary

is
lowering
the

to
accommodate

incorrect

said
jesus
a
careful
study
of
this

allows
that
here
the
word
soul
means
a
false

the

was
a
warning
to
beware
not
of

of

no

a

harm
done
by
physicians
the
doctor
mind
reaches
that
of
his

the
doctor
should
suppress
his
fear
of
disease
else
his
belief
in
its
reality
and
fatality
will
harm
his
patients
even
more
than
his
calomel

for
the

stratum

in

more
power
to
harm

than
the
substratum

a

hears
the

as
a

hears
his
sentence
the

may
seem
calm
under
it

he
is
not
his
fortitude
may
sustain
him

his
fear
which
has
already
developed

is
increased
by

humane

an
ist
who
outlines
his
thought
relative
to

and
then
fills
in
his
delineations
with
sketches
from
books
it
is
better
to
prevent
disease
from
forming
in
mortal
mind
afterwards
to
appear
on
the
body
but
to
do
this
requires
attention
the
thought
of
disease
is
formed
before
one
sees
a
doctor
and
before
the
doctor
undertakes
to
dispel
it
by
a
perhaps
by
a
blister
by
the
application
of
caustic
or
croton
oil
or
by
a
surgical
operation
again
giving
other
direction
to

the
physician
prescribes
drugs
until
the
elasticity
of

haply
causes
a
vigorous
reaction
upon

and
reproduces
a
picture
of
healthy
and
harmonious

a

is
more
or

by
his

belief
in

says
nothing

the

it

or
that
a

if

the

if

it

not

the

we

either
in

in

we
agine
that

when

has
overtaxed
the

in

it
then
mortals
believe
that

this

true
death

the

the

the

evil

of

it

so

mortal

is

of

antagonistic

unscientific
theories
such
theories
are
evidently
erroneous
they
can
never
stand
the
test
of
science
judging
them
by
their
fruits
they
are
corrupt
when
will
the
ages
stand
the
ego
and
realize
only
one
god
one
mind
or
intelligence
false
and
theories
have
given
sinners
the
notion
that
they
can
create
what
god
can
not
namely
sinful
mortals
in
god
image
thus
usurping
the
name
without
the
nature
of
the
image
or
reflection
of
divine
mind
but
in
science
it
can
never
be
said
that
man
has
a
mind
of
his
own
distinct
from
god
the
mind
the
belief
that
god
lives
in
matter
is
pantheistic
the
error
which
says
that
soul
is
in
body
mind
is
in
matter
and
good
is
in
evil
must
unsay
it
and
cease
from
such
utterances
else
god
will
continue
to
be
hidden
from
manity
and
mortals
will
sin
without
knowing
that
they
are
sinning
will
lean
on
matter
instead
of
spirit
stumble
with
lameness
drop
with
drunkenness
consume
with
case
all
because
of
their
blindness
their
false
sense
concerning
god
and
man
creation
perfect
when
will
the
error
of
believing
that
there
is
life
in
matter
and
that
sin
sickness
and
death
are
creations
of
god
be
unmasked
when
will
it
be
stood
that
matter
has
neither
intelligence
life
nor
sensation
and
that
the
opposite
belief
is
the
prolific
source
of
all
suffering
god
created
all
through
mind
and
made
all
perfect
and
eternal
where
then
is
the
necessity
for
recreation
or
procreation
perceiving
the
divine
image
befogged
in
error
the
error
of
believing
that
matter
can
be
intelligent
for
good
or
evil
we
can
catch
clear
glimpses
of
god
only
as
the
mists
disperse
or
as
they
melt
into
such
thinness
that
we
ceive
the
divine
image
in
some
word
or
deed
which
indicates
the
true
idea
the
supremacy
and
ity
of
good
the
nothingness
and
unreality
of
evil
redemption
from
selfishness
when
we
realize
that
there
is
one
mind
the
divine
law
of
loving
our
neighbor
as
ourselves
is
unfolded
whereas
a
belief
in
many
ruling
minds
hinders
man
normal
drift
towards
the
one
mind
one
god
and
leads
human
thought
into
opposite
channels
where
selfishness
reigns
selfishness
tips
the
beam
of
human
existence
towards
the
side
of
error
not
towards
truth
denial
of
the
ness
of
mind
throws
our
weight
into
the
scale
not
of
spirit
god
good
but
of
matter
when
we
fully
understand
our
relation
to
the
divine
we
can
have
no
other
mind
but
his
no
other
love
wisdom
or
truth
no
other
sense
of
life
and
no
sciousness
of
the
existence
of
matter
or
error
unrighteous
the
power
of
the
human
will
should
be
exercised
only
in
subordination
to
truth
else
it
will
misguide
the
ment
and
free
the
lower
propensities
it
is
the
province
of
spiritual
sense
to
govern
man
material
erring
human
thought
acts
injuriously
both
upon
the
body
and
through
it
is
capable
of
all
evil
it
can
never
heal
the
sick
for
it
is
the
prayer
of
the
unrighteous
while
the
exercise
of
the
sentiments
hope
faith
love
is
the
prayer
of
the
righteous
this
prayer
governed
by
science
instead
of
the
senses
heals
the
sick
in
the
scientific
relation
of
god
to
man
we
find
that
whatever
blesses
one
blesses
all
as
jesus
showed
with
the
loaves
and
the
fishes
spirit
not
matter
being
the
source
of
supply
birth
and
death
unreal
does
god
send
sickness
giving
the
mother
her
child
for
the
brief
space
of
a
few
years
and
then
taking
it
away
by
death
is
god
creating
anew
what
he
has
already
created
the
scriptures
are
nite
on
this
point
declaring
that
his
work
nothing
is
new
to
god
and
that
it
was
can
there
be
any
birth
or
death
for
man
the
spiritual
image
and
likeness
of
god
instead
of
god
sending
sickness
and
death
he
destroys
them
and
brings
to
light
immortality
omnipotent
and
infinite
mind
made
all
and
includes
all
this
mind
does
not
make
mistakes
and
subsequently
correct
them
god
does
not
cause
man
to
sin
to
be
sick
or
to
die
no
evil
in
spirit
there
are
evil
beliefs
often
called
evil
spirits
but
these
evils
are
not
spirit
for
there
is
no
evil
in
spirit
because
god
is
spirit
evil
becomes
more
apparent
and
obnoxious
proportionately
as
we
advance
itually
until
it
disappears
from
our
lives
this
fact
proves
our
position
for
every
scientific
ment
in
christianity
has
its
proof
error
of
statement
leads
to
error
in
action
subordination
of
evil
god
is
not
the
creator
of
an
evil
mind
indeed
evil
is
not
mind
we
must
learn
that
evil
is
the
awful
tion
and
unreality
of
existence
evil
is
not
supreme
good
is
not
helpless
nor
are
the
laws
of
matter
primary
and
the
law
of
spirit
secondary
without
this
lesson
we
lose
sight
of
the
fect
father
or
the
divine
principle
of
man
evident
impossibilities
body
is
not
first
and
soul
last
nor
is
evil
mightier
than
good
the
science
of
being
repudiates
evident
impossibilities
such
as
the
tion
of
truth
and
error
in
cause
or
effect
science
rates
the
tares
and
wheat
in
time
of
harvest
one
primal
cause
there
is
but
one
primal
cause
therefore
there
can
be
no
effect
from
any
other
cause
and
there
can
be
no
reality
in
aught
which
does
not
proceed
from
this
great
and
only
cause
sin
sickness
ease
and
death
belong
not
to
the
science
of
being
they
are
the
errors
which
presuppose
the
absence
of
truth
life
or
love
the
spiritual
reality
is
the
scientific
fact
in
all
things
the
spiritual
fact
repeated
in
the
action
of
man
and
the
whole
universe
is
harmonious
and
is
the
ideal
of
truth
spiritual
facts
are
not
inverted
the
opposite
discord
which
bears
no
resemblance
to
spirituality
is
not
real
the
only
evidence
of
this
inversion
is
obtained
from
suppositional
error
which
affords
no
proof
of
god
spirit
or
of
the
spiritual
creation
material
sense
fines
all
things
materially
and
has
a
finite
sense
of
the
infinite
seemingly
independent
authority
the
scriptures
say
in
him
we
live
and
move
and
have
our
being
what
then
is
this
seeming
power
dependent
of
god
which
causes
disease
and
cures
it
what
is
it
but
an
error
of
belief
a
law
of
mortal
mind
wrong
in
every
sense
embracing
sin
sickness
and
death
it
is
the
very
pode
of
immortal
mind
of
truth
and
of
spiritual
law
it
is
not
in
accordance
with
the
goodness
of
god
acter
that
he
should
make
man
sick
then
leave
man
to
heal
himself
it
is
absurd
to
suppose
that
matter
can
both
cause
and
cure
disease
or
that
spirit
god
produces
disease
and
leaves
the
remedy
to
matter
john
young

edinburgh
writes
god

according
to
the

you
embrace

you

you
should

and
of
other

man

it

it

its

the

jesus
healed
sickness
and
sin
by
one
and
the
same
metaphysical
process
mind
not
mortal
the
expression
is
really
a
solecism
for
mind
is
immortal
and
truth
pierces
the
error
of
mortality
as
a
sunbeam
penetrates
the
cloud
because
in
obedience
to
the
immutable
law
of
spirit
this
mind
is
i
name
it
mortal
error
soweth
the
wind
and
reapeth
the
whirlwind
matter
mindless
what
is
termed
matter
being
unintelligent
can
not
say
i
suffer
i
die
i
am
sick
or
i
am
well
it
is
the
called
mortal
mind
which
voices
this
and
pears
to
itself
to
make
good
its
claim
to
mortal
sense
sin
and
suffering
are
real
but
immortal
sense
includes
no
evil
nor
pestilence
because
immortal
sense
has
no
error
of
sense
it
has
no
sense
of
error
there
fore
it
is
without
a
destructive
element
if
brain
nerves
stomach
are
intelligent
if
they
talk
to
us
tell
us
their
condition
and
report
how
they
feel
then
spirit
and
matter
truth
and
error
commingle
and
produce
sickness
and
health
good
and
evil
life
and
death
and
who
shall
say
whether
truth
or
error
is
the
greater
matter
sensationless
the
sensations
of
the
body
must
either
be
the
tions
of
a
mortal
mind
or
of
matter
nerves
are
not
mind
is
it
not
provable
that
mind
is
not
and
that
matter
has
no
sensation
is
it
not
equally
true
that
matter
does
not
appear
in
the
spiritual
understanding
of
being
the
sensation
of
sickness
and
the
impulse
to
sin
seem
to
obtain
in
mortal
mind
when
a
tear
starts
does
not
this
mind
produce
the
effect
seen
in
the
mal
gland
without
mortal
mind
the
tear
could
not
appear
and
this
action
shows
the
nature
of
all
material
cause
and
effect
it
should
no
longer
be
said
in
israel
that
the
fathers
have
eaten
sour
grapes
and
the
children
teeth
are
set
on
edge
sympathy
with
error
should
disappear
the
transfer
of
the
thoughts
of
one
erring
mind
to
another
science
renders
impossible
nerves
painless
if
it
is
true
that
nerves
have
sensation
that
matter
has
intelligence
that
the
material
organism
causes
the
eyes
to
see
and
the
ears
to
hear
then
when
the
body
is
dematerialized
these
faculties
must
be
lost
for
their
immortality
is
not
in
spirit
whereas
the
fact
is
that
only
through
dematerialization
and
tion
of
thought
can
these
faculties
be
conceived
of
as
immortal
nerves
are
not
the
source
of
pain
or
pleasure
we
suffer
or
enjoy
in
our
dreams
but
this
pain
or
pleasure
is
not
communicated
through
a
nerve
a
tooth
which
has
been
extracted
sometimes
aches
again
in
belief
and
the
pain
seems
to
be
in
its
old
place
a
limb
which
has
been
amputated
has
continued
in
belief
to
pain
the
owner
if
the
sensation
of
pain
in
the
limb
can
return
can
be
longed
why
can
not
the
limb
reappear
why
need
pain
rather
than
pleasure
come
to
this
tal
sense
because
the
memory
of
pain
is
more
vivid
than
the
memory
of
pleasure
i
have
seen
an
unwitting
attempt
to
scratch
the
end
of
a
finger
which
had
been
cut
off
for
months
when
the
nerve
is
gone
which
we
say
was
the
occasion
of
pain
and
the
pain
still
remains
it
proves
sensation
to
be
in
the
mortal
mind
not
in
matter
reverse
the
process
take
away
this
mind
instead
of
a
piece
of
the
flesh
and
the
nerves
have
no
sensation
human
falsities
mortals
have
a
modus
of
their
own
undirected
and
sustained
by
god
they
produce
a
rose
through
seed
and
soil
and
bring
the
rose
into
contact
with
the
olfactory
nerves
that
they
may
smell
it
in
legerdemain
and
credulous
frenzy
mortals
believe
that
unseen
spirits
produce
the

god
alone
makes
and
clothes
the
lilies
of
the
field
and
this
he
does
by

in
because
all
the

we

possibly
that

involve

the

discard
the
one
mind
and
true
source
of
being
it
is
possible
that
the
impressions
from
truth
were
as
distinct
as
sound
and
that
they
came
as
sound
to
the
primitive
prophets
if
the
medium
of
hearing
is
wholly
spiritual
it
is
normal
and
indestructible
if
enoch
perception
had
been
confined
to
the
evidence
before
his
material
senses
he
could
never
have
walked
with
god
nor
been
guided
into
the
demonstration
of
life
eternal
adam
and
the
senses
adam
represented
in
the
scriptures
as
formed
from
dust
is
an
for
the
human
mind
the
rial
senses
like
adam
originate
in
matter
and
return
to
dust
are
proved
they
go
out
as
they
came
in
for
they
are
still
the
error
not
the
truth
of
being
when
it
is
learned
that
the
ual
sense
and
not
the
material
conveys
the
impressions
of
mind
to
man
then
being
will
be
understood
and
found
to
be
harmonious
idolatrous
illusions
we
bow
down
to
matter
and
entertain
finite
thoughts
of
god
like
the
pagan
idolater
mortals
are
inclined
to
fear
and
to
obey
what
they
consider
a
material
body
more
than
they
do
a
spiritual
god
all
material
knowledge
like
the
original
tree
of
knowledge
multiplies
their
pains
for
mortal
illusions
would
rob
god
slay
man
and
meanwhile
would
spread
their
table
with
cannibal
tidbits
and
give
thanks
the
senses
of
soul
how
transient
a
sense
is
mortal
sight
when
a
wound
on
the
retina
may
end
the
power
of
light
and
lens
but
the
real
sight
or
sense
is
not
lost
neither
age
nor
accident
can
interfere
with
the
senses
of
soul
and
there
are
no
other
real
senses
it
is
evident
that
the
body
as
matter
has
no
sensation
of
its
own
and
there
is
no
oblivion
for
soul
and
its
faculties
spirit
senses
are
out
pain
and
they
are
forever
at
peace
nothing
can
hide
from
them
the
harmony
of
all
things
and
the
might
and
permanence
of
truth
real
being
never
lost
if
spirit
soul
could
sin
or
be
lost
then
being
and
mortality
would
be
lost
together
with
all
the
faculties
of
mind
but
being
can
not
be
lost
while
god
ists
soul
and
matter
are
at
variance
from
the
very
necessity
of
their
opposite
natures
mortals
are
unacquainted
with
the
reality
of
existence
because
matter
and
mortality
do
not
reflect
the
facts
of
spirit
spiritual
vision
is
not
subordinate
to
geometric
tudes
whatever
is
governed
by
god
is
never
for
an
instant
deprived
of
the
light
and
might
of
intelligence
and
life
light
and
darkness
we
are
sometimes
led
to
believe
that
darkness
is
as
real
as
light
but
science
affirms
darkness
to
be
only
a
mortal
sense
of
the
absence
of
light
at
the
coming
of
which
darkness
loses
the
appearance
of
reality
so
sin
and
sorrow
disease
and
death
are
the
suppositional
absence
of
life
god
and
flee
as
phantoms
of
error
before
truth
and
love
with
its
divine
proof
science
reverses
the
evidence
of
material
sense
every
quality
and
condition
of
mortality
is
lost
swallowed
up
in
immortality
mortal
man
is
the
antipode
of
immortal
man
in
origin
in
existence
and
in
his
relation
to
god
faith
of
socrates
because
he
understood
the
superiority
and
tality
of
good
socrates
feared
not
the
hemlock
poison
even
the
faith
of
his
philosophy
spurned
ical
timidity
having
sought
man
spiritual
state
he
recognized
the
immortality
of
man
the
rance
and
malice
of
the
age
would
have
killed
the
able
philosopher
because
of
his
faith
in
soul
and
his
difference
to
the
body
the
serpent
of
error
who
shall
say
that
man
is
alive
but
may
be
dead
what
has
touched
life
god
to
such
strange
issues
here
theories
cease
and
ence
unveils
the
mystery
and
solves
the
lem
of
man
error
bites
the
heel
of
truth
but
can
not
kill
truth
truth
bruises
the
head
of
error
destroys
error
spirituality
lays
open
siege
to
materialism
on
which
side
are
we
fighting
servants
and
masters
the
understanding
that
the
ego
is
mind
and
that
there
is
but
one
mind
or
intelligence
begins
at
once
to
destroy
the
errors
of
mortal
sense
and
to
supply
the
truth
of
immortal
sense
this
ing
makes
the
body
harmonious
it
makes
the
nerves
bones
brain
servants
instead
of
masters
if
man
is
governed
by
the
law
of
divine
mind
his
body
is
in
mission
to
everlasting
life
and
truth
and
love
the
great
mistake
of
mortals
is
to
suppose
that
man
image
and
likeness
is
both
matter
and
spirit
both
good
and
evil
if
the
decision
were
left
to
the
corporeal
senses
evil
would
appear
to
be
the
master
of
good
and
sickness
to
be
the
rule
of
existence
while
health
would
seem
the
exception
death
the
inevitable
and
life
a
paradox
paul
asked
what
concord
hath
christ
with
belial
inthians
vi
personal
identity
when
you
say
man
body
is
material
i
say
with
paul
be
willing
rather
to
be
absent
from
the
body
and
to
be
present
with
the
lord
give
up
your
material
belief
of
mind
in
matter
and
have
but
one
mind
even
god
for
this
mind
forms
its
own
likeness
the
loss
of
man
identity
through
the
understanding
which
science
confers
is
impossible
and
the
notion
of
such
a
possibility
is
more
absurd
than
to
conclude
that
individual
musical
tones
are
lost
in
the
origin
of
harmony
paul
experience
medical
schools
may
inform
us
that
the
healing
work
of
christian
science
and
paul
peculiar
christian
version
and
experience
which
prove
mind
to
be
scientifically
distinct
from
matter
are
indications
of
unnatural
mental
and
bodily
conditions
even
of
catalepsy
and
hysteria
yet
if
we
turn
to
the
tures
what
do
we
read
why
this
if
a
man
keep
my
saying
he
shall
never
see
death
and
henceforth
know
we
no
man
after
the
flesh
fatigue
is
mental
that
scientific
methods
are
superior
to
others
is
seen
by
their
effects
when
you
have
once
conquered
a
diseased
condition
of
the
body
through
mind
that
condition
never
recurs
and
you
have
won
a
point
in
science
when
mentality
gives
rest
to
the
body
the
next
toil
will
fatigue
you
less
for
you
are
working
out
the
problem
of
being
in
divine
physics
and
in
proportion
as
you
understand
the
trol
which
mind
has
over
matter
you
will
be
able
to
demonstrate
this
control
the
scientific
and
permanent
remedy
for
fatigue
is
to
learn
the
power
of
mind
over
the
body
or
any
illusion
of
physical
weariness
and
so
destroy
this
illusion
for
matter
can
not
be
weary
and
you
say
toil
fatigues
me
but
what
is
this
is
it
muscle
or
mind
which
is
tired
and
so
speaks
without
mind
could
the
muscles
be
tired
do
the
muscles
talk
or
do
you
talk
for
them
matter
is
intelligent
mortal
mind
does
the
false
talking
and
that
which
affirms
weariness
made
that
weariness
mind
never
weary
you
do
not
say
a
wheel
is
fatigued
and
yet
the
body
is
as
material
as
the
wheel
if
it
were
not
for
what
the
human
mind
says
of
the
body
the
body
like
the
inanimate
wheel
would
never
be
weary
the
consciousness
of
truth
rests
us
more
than
hours
of
repose
in
unconsciousness
coalition
of
sin
and
sickness
the
body
is
supposed
to
say
i
am
the
reports
of
sickness
may
form
a
coalition
with
the
reports
of
sin
and
say
i
am
malice
lust
appetite
envy
hate
what
renders
both
sin
and
sickness
difficult
of
cure
is
that
the
human
mind
is
the
sinner
disinclined
to
and
believing
that
the
body
can
be
sick
independently
of
mortal
mind
and
that
the
divine
mind
has
no
jurisdiction
over
the
body
sickness
akin
to
sin
why
pray
for
the
recovery
of
the
sick
if
you
are
out
faith
in
god
willingness
and
ability
to
heal
them
if
you
do
believe
in
god
why
do
you
stitute
drugs
for
the
almighty
power
and
employ
means
which
lead
only
into
material
ways
of
obtaining
help
instead
of
turning
in
time
of
need
to
god
divine
love
who
is
an
help
treat
a
belief
in
sickness
as
you
would
sin
with
sudden
dismissal
resist
the
temptation
to
believe
in
matter
as
intelligent
as
having
sensation
or
power
the
scriptures
say
they
that
wait
upon
the
lord
shall
run
and
not
be
weary
and
they
shall
walk
and
not
faint
the
meaning
of
that
passage
is
not
perverted
by
applying
it
literally
to
moments
of
fatigue
for
the
moral
and
physical
are
as
one
in
their
results
when
we
wake
to
the
truth
of
being
all
disease
pain
weakness
weariness
sorrow
sin
death
will
be
unknown
and
the
mortal
dream
will
forever
cease
my
method
of
treating
fatigue
applies
to
all
bodily
ailments
since
mind
should
be
and
is
supreme
absolute
and
final
affirmation
and
result
in
mathematics
we
do
not
multiply
when
we
should
subtract
and
then
say
the
product
is
correct
no
more
can
we
say
in
science
that
muscles
give
strength
that
nerves
give
pain
or
pleasure
or
that
matter
governs
and
then
expect
that
the
result
will
be
harmony
not
muscles
nerves
nor
bones
but
mortal
mind
makes
the
whole
body
sick
and
the
whole
heart
faint
whereas
divine
mind
heals
when
this
is
understood
we
shall
never
affirm
ing
the
body
what
we
do
not
wish
to
have
manifested
we
shall
not
call
the
body
weak
if
we
would
have
it
strong
for
the
belief
in
feebleness
must
obtain
in
the
human
mind
before
it
can
be
made
manifest
on
the
body
and
the
destruction
of
the
belief
will
be
the
removal
of
its
effects
science
includes
no
rule
of
discord
but
governs
harmoniously
the
wish
says
the
poet
is
ever
father
to
the
thought
scientific
beginning
we
may
hear
a
sweet
melody
and
yet
misunderstand
the
science
that
governs
it
those
who
are
healed
through
metaphysical
science
not
hending
the
principle
of
the
cure
may
derstand
it
and
impute
their
recovery
to
change
of
air
or
diet
not
rendering
to
god
the
honor
due
to
him
alone
entire
immunity
from
the
belief
in
sin
suffering
and
death
may
not
be
reached
at
this
period
but
we
may
look
for
an
abatement
of
these
evils
and
this
scientific
ning
is
in
the
right
direction
hygiene
ineffectual
we
hear
it
said
i
exercise
daily
in
the
open
air
i
take
cold
baths
in
order
to
overcome
a
predisposition
to
take
cold
and
yet
i
have
continual
colds
catarrh
and
cough
such
admissions
ought
to
open
people
eyes
to
the
inefficacy
of
material
hygiene
and
induce
sufferers
to
look
in
other
directions
for
cause
and
cure
instinct
is
better
than
misguided
reason
as
even
ture
declares
the
violet
lifts
her
blue
eye
to
greet
the
early
spring
the
leaves
clap
their
hands
as
untired
worshippers
the
snowbird
sings
and
soars
amid
the
blasts
he
has
no
catarrh
from
wet
feet
and
procures
a
summer
residence
with
more
ease
than
a
bob
the
atmosphere
of
the
earth
kinder
than
the
mosphere
of
mortal
mind
leaves
catarrh
to
the
latter
colds
coughs
and
contagion
are
engendered
solely
by
human
theories
the
reflex
phenomena
mortal
mind
produces
its
own
phenomena
and
then
charges
them
to
something
else
like
a
kitten
glancing
into
the
mirror
at
itself
and
thinking
it
sees
another
kitten
a
clergyman
once
adopted
a
diet
of
bread
and
water
to
increase
his
spirituality
finding
his
health
failing
he
gave
up
his
abstinence
and
advised
others
never
to
try
dietetics
for
growth
in
grace
volition
the
belief
that
either
fasting
or
feasting
makes
men
better
morally
or
physically
is
one
of
the
fruits
of
the
tree
of
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
cerning
which
god
said
thou
shalt
not
eat
of
it
mortal
mind
forms
all
conditions
of
the
mortal
body
and
controls
the
stomach
bones
lungs
heart
blood
as
directly
as
the
volition
or
will
moves
the
mind
starvation
and
dyspepsia
i
knew
a
person
who
when
quite
a
child
adopted
the
graham
system
to
cure
dyspepsia
for
many
years
he
ate
only
bread
and
vegetables
and
drank
ing
but
water
his
dyspepsia
increasing
he
decided
that
his
diet
should
be
more
rigid
and
thereafter
he
partook
of
but
one
meal
in
hours
this
meal
consisting
of
only
a
thin
slice
of
bread
without
water
his
physician
also
recommended
that
he
should
not
wet
his
parched
throat
until
three
hours
after
eating
he
passed
many
weary
years
in
hunger
and
weakness
almost
in
starvation
and
finally
made
up
his
mind
to
die
having
exhausted
the
skill
of
the
doctors
who
kindly
informed
him
that
death
was
indeed
his
only
alternative
at
this
point
christian
science
saved
him
and
he
is
now
in
perfect
health
without
a
vestige
of
the
old
complaint
he
learned
that
suffering
and
disease
were
the
imposed
beliefs
of
mortals
and
not
the
facts
of
being
that
god
never
decreed
disease
never
ordained
a
law
that
fasting
should
be
a
means
of
health
hence
starvation
is
not
acceptable
to
wisdom
and
it
is
equally
far
from
science
in
which
being
is
sustained
by
god
mind
these
truths
opening
his
eyes
relieved
his
stomach
and
he
ate
without
suffering
giving
god
thanks
but
he
never
enjoyed
his
food
as
he
had
imagined
he
would
when
still
the
slave
of
matter
he
thought
of
the
pots
of
egypt
feeling
childhood
hunger
and
plined
by
and
divine
science
mind
and
stomach
this
understanding
that
neither
food
nor
the
stomach
without
the
consent
of
mortal
mind
can
make
one
suffer
brings
with
it
other
lesson
that
gluttony
is
a
sensual
illusion
and
that
this
phantasm
of
mortal
mind
disappears
as
we
better
apprehend
our
spiritual
existence
and
ascend
the
ladder
of
life
this
person
learned
that
food
affects
the
body
only
as
mortal
mind
has
its
material
methods
of
working
one
of
which
is
to
believe
that
proper
food
supplies
nutriment
and
strength
to
the
human
system
he
learned
also
that
mortal
mind
makes
a
mortal
body
whereas
truth
generates
this
fleshly
mind
and
feeds
thought
with
the
bread
of
life
food
had
less
power
to
help
or
to
hurt
him
after
he
had
availed
himself
of
the
fact
that
mind
governs
man
and
he
also
had
less
faith
in
the
pleasures
and
pains
of
matter
taking
less
thought
about
what
he
should
eat
or
drink
consulting
the
stomach
less
about
the
economy
of
living
and
god
more
he
recovered
strength
and
flesh
rapidly
for
many
years
he
had
been
kept
alive
as
was
believed
only
by
the
strictest
herence
to
hygiene
and
drugs
and
yet
he
continued
ill
all
the
while
now
he
dropped
drugs
and
material
hygiene
and
was
well
he
learned
that
a
dyspeptic
was
very
far
from
being
the
image
and
likeness
of
god
far
from
having
minion
over
the
fish
of
the
sea
and
over
the
fowl
of
the
air
and
over
the
cattle
if
eating
a
bit
of
animal
flesh
could
overpower
him
he
finally
concluded
that
god
never
made
a
dyspeptic
while
fear
hygiene
physiology
and
physics
had
made
him
one
contrary
to
his
commands
life
only
in
spirit
in
seeking
a
cure
for
dyspepsia
consult
matter
not
at
all
and
eat
what
is
set
before
you
asking
no
question
for
conscience
sake
we
must
destroy
the
false
belief
that
life
and
intelligence
are
in
matter
and
plant
ourselves
upon
what
is
pure
and
fect
paul
said
walk
in
the
spirit
and
ye
shall
not
fulfil
the
lust
of
the
flesh
sooner
or
later
we
shall
learn
that
the
fetters
of
man
finite
capacity
are
forged
by
the
illusion
that
he
lives
in
body
instead
of
in
soul
in
matter
instead
of
in
spirit
soul
greater
than
body
matter
does
not
express
spirit
god
is
infinite
present
spirit
if
spirit
is
and
is
everywhere
what
and
where
is
matter
remember
that
truth
is
greater
than
error
and
we
can
not
put
the
greater
into
the
less
soul
is
spirit
and
spirit
is
greater
than
body
if
spirit
were
once
within
the
body
spirit
would
be
finite
and
therefore
could
not
be
spirit
the
question
of
the
ages
the
question
what
is
truth
convulses
the
world
many
are
ready
to
meet
this
inquiry
with
the
assurance
which
comes
of
understanding
but
more
are
blinded
by
their
old
illusions
and
try
to
give
it
pause
if
the
blind
lead
the
blind
both
shall
fall
into
the
ditch
the
efforts
of
error
to
answer
this
question
by
some
are
vain
spiritual
rationality
and
free
thought
company
approaching
science
and
can
not
be
put
down
they
will
emancipate
humanity
and
supplant
unscientific
means
and
laws
heralds
of
science
peals
that
should
startle
the
slumbering
thought
from
its
erroneous
dream
are
partially
unheeded
but
the
last
trump
has
not
sounded
or
this
would
not
be
so
marvels
calamities
and
sin
will
much
more
abound
as
truth
urges
upon
mortals
its
resisted
claims
but
the
awful
daring
of
sin
destroys
sin
and
foreshadows
the
triumph
of
truth
god
will
turn
until
he
come
whose
right
it
is
longevity
is
increasing
and
the
power
of
sin
diminishing
for
the
world
feels
the
alterative
effect
of
truth
through
every
pore
as
the
crude
footprints
of
the
past
disappear
from
the
dissolving
paths
of
the
present
we
shall
better
understand
the
science
which
governs
these
changes
and
shall
plant
our
feet
on
firmer
ground
every
sensuous
pleasure
or
pain

through

there
should
be
painless
progress
attended
by

sectarianism
and
opposition
in
the
record
of
nineteen
centuries
there
are
sects
many
but
not
enough
christianity
centuries
ago
ligionists
were
ready
to
hail
an
phic
god
and
array
his
vicegerent
with
pomp
and
splendor
but
this
was
not
the
manner
of
truth
appearing
of
old
the
cross
was
truth
tral
sign
and
it
is
the
modern
lash
is
less
material
than
the
roman
scourge
but
it
is
equally
as
cutting
cold
disdain
stubborn
resistance
opposition
from
church
state
laws
and
the
press
are
still
the
bingers
of
truth
appearing
a
higher
and
more
practical
christianity
ing
justice
and
meeting
the
needs
of
mortals
in
sickness
and
in
health
stands
at
the
door
of
this
age
knocking
for
admission
will
you
open
or
close
the
door
upon
this
angel
visitant
who
cometh
in
the
quiet
of
meekness
as
he
came
of
old
to
the
patriarch
at
noonday
mental
emancipation
truth
brings
the
elements
of
liberty
on
its
banner
is
the
motto
slavery
is
abolished
the
power
of
god
brings
deliverance
to
the
tive
no
power
can
withstand
divine
love
what
is
this
supposed
power
which
opposes
itself
to

whence
cometh
it
what
is
it
that
binds
man
with
iron
shackles
to
sin
sickness
and
death
whatever
enslaves
man
is
opposed
to
the

truth
makes

free
truth
ordeal
you
may
know
when
first
truth
leads
by
the
ness
and
faithfulness
of
its
followers
thus
it
is
that
the
march
of
time
bears
onward
banner
the
powers
of
this
world
will
fight
and
will
command
their
sentinels
not
to
let
truth
pass
the
guard
until
it
subscribes
to
their
systems
but
science
heeding
not
the
pointed
bayonet
marches
on
there
is
always
some
tumult
but
there
is
a
rallying
to
standard
immortal
sentences
the
history
of
our
country
like
all
history
illustrates
the
might
of
mind
and
shows
human
power
to
be
tionate
to
its
embodiment
of
right
thinking
a
few
immortal
sentences
breathing
the
tence
of
divine
justice
have
been
potent
to
break
despotic
fetters
and
abolish
the
and
slave
market
but
oppression
neither
went
down
in
blood
nor
did
the
breath
of
freedom
come
from
the
cannon
mouth
love
is
the
liberator
slavery
abolished
legally
to
abolish
unpaid
servitude
in
the
united
states
was
hard
but
the
abolition
of
mental
slavery
is
a
more
difficult
task
the
despotic
cies
inherent
in
mortal
mind
and
always
minating
in
new
forms
of
tyranny
must
be
rooted
out
through
the
action
of
the
divine
mind
men
and
women
of
all
climes
and
races
are
still
in
bondage
to
material
sense
ignorant
how
to
obtain
their
freedom
the
rights
of
man
were
vindicated
in
a
single
section
and
on
the
lowest
plane
of
human
life
when
can
slavery
was
abolished
in
our
land
that
was
only
prophetic
of
further
steps
towards
the
banishment
of
a
slavery
found
on
higher
planes
of
existence
and
under
more
subtle
and
depraving
forms
liberty
crusade
the
voice
of
god
in
behalf
of
the
african
slave
was
still
echoing
in
our
land
when
the
voice
of
the
herald
of
this
new
crusade
sounded
the
keynote
of
versal
freedom
asking
a
fuller
ment
of
the
rights
of
man
as
a
son
of
god
demanding
that
the
fetters
of
sin
sickness
and
death
be
stricken
from
the
human
mind
and
that
its
freedom
be
won
not
through
human
warfare
not
with
bayonet
and
blood
but
through
christ
divine
science
cramping
systems
god
has
built
a
higher
platform
of
human
rights
and
he
has
built
it
on
diviner
claims
these
claims
are
not
made
through
code
or
creed
but
in
tion
of
on
earth
peace
toward
men
human
codes
scholastic
theology
material
medicine
and
hygiene
fetter
faith
and
spiritual
understanding
divine
science
rends
asunder
these
fetters
and
man
birthright
of
sole
allegiance
to
his
maker
asserts
itself
i
saw
before
me
the
sick
wearing
out
years
of
tude
to
an
unreal
master
in
the
belief
that
the
body
erned
them
rather
than
mind
house
of
bondage
the
lame
the
deaf
the
dumb
the
blind
the
sick
the
sensual
the
sinner
i
wished
to
save
from
the
slavery
of
their
own
beliefs
and
from
the
educational
systems
of
the
pharaohs
who
as
of
yore
hold
the
children
of
israel
in
bondage
i
saw
fore
me
the
awful
conflict
the
red
sea
and
the
ness
but
i
pressed
on
through
faith
in
god
trusting
truth
the
strong
deliverer
to
guide
me
into
the
land
of
christian
science
where
fetters
fall
and
the
rights
of
man
are
fully
known
and
acknowledged
higher
law
ends
bondage
i
saw
that
the
law
of
mortal
belief
included
all
error
and
that
even
as
oppressive
laws
are
disputed
and
tals
are
taught
their
right
to
freedom
so
the
claims
of
the
enslaving
senses
must
be
nied
and
superseded
the
law
of
the
divine
mind
must
end
human
bondage
or
mortals
will
continue
unaware
of
man
inalienable
rights
and
in
subjection
to
less
slavery
because
some
public
teachers
permit
an
ignorance
of
divine
power
an
ignorance
that
is
the
foundation
of
continued
bondage
and
of
human
suffering
native
freedom
discerning
the
rights
of
man
we
can
not
fail
to
see
the
doom
of
all
oppression
slavery
is
not
the
mate
state
of
man
god
made
man
free
paul
said
i
was

all
men
should
be
free
where
the

of
the
lord
is
there
is

and
truth
make
free
but
evil
and
error
lead
into
captivity
standard
of

christian
science
raises
the
standard
of
liberty
and
cries
follow
me
escape
from
the
bondage
of

sin
and

jesus
marked
out
the
way
citizens
of
the
world
accept
the
ous
liberty
of
the
children
of
god
and
be
free
this
is
your
divine
right
the
illusion
of
material
sense
not
divine
law
has
bound
you
entangled
your
free
limbs
crippled
your
capacities
enfeebled
your
body
and
faced
the
tablet
of
your
being
if
god
had
instituted
material
laws
to
govern
man
disobedience
to
which
would
have
made
man
ill
jesus
would
not
have
disregarded
those
laws
by
healing
in
direct
opposition
to
them
and
in
defiance
of
all
material
conditions
no
fleshly
heredity
the
transmission
of
disease
or
of
certain
sies
of
mortal
mind
would
be
impossible
if
this
great
fact
of
being
were
learned
namely
that
nothing
inharmonious
can
enter
being
for
life
god
heredity
is
a
prolific
subject
for
mortal
belief
to
pin
ories
upon
but
if
we
learn
that
nothing
is
real
but
the
right
we
shall
have
no
dangerous
inheritances
and
fleshly
ills
will
disappear
dominion
the
enslavement
of
man
is
not
legitimate
it
will
cease
when
man
enters
into
his
heritage
of
freedom
his
dominion
over
the
material
senses
mortals
will
some
day
assert
their
freedom
in
the
name
of
almighty
god
then
they
will
control
their
own
bodies
through
the
understanding
of
divine
science
dropping
their
present
beliefs
they
will
recognize
mony
as
the
spiritual
reality
and
discord
as
the
material
unreality
if
we
follow
the
command
of
our
master
take
no
thought
for
your
life
we
shall
never
depend
on
bodily
conditions
structure
or
economy
but
we
shall
be
masters
of
the
body
dictate
its
terms
and

and
control
it
with

priestly
pride
humbled
there
is
no
power
apart
from
god
omnipotence
has
and
to
acknowledge
any
other
power
is
to
honor
god
the
humble
nazarene
overthrew
the
supposition
that
sin
sickness
and
death
have
power
he
proved
them
powerless
it
should
have
humbled
the
pride
of
the
priests
when
they
saw
the
onstration
of
christianity
excel
the
influence
of
their
dead
faith
and
ceremonies
if
mind
is
not
the
master
of
sin
sickness
and
death
they
are
immortal
for
it
is
already
proved
that
ter
has
not
destroyed
them
but
is
their
basis
and
support
no
union
of
opposites
we
should
hesitate
to
say
that
jehovah
sins
or
suffers
but
if
sin
and
suffering
are
realities
of
being
whence
did
they
emanate
god
made
all
that
was
made
and
mind
signifies
god
infinity
not
finity
not
far
removed
from
infidelity
is
the
belief
which
unites
such
opposites
as
sickness
and
health
holiness
and
unholiness
calls
both
the
offspring
of
spirit
and
at
the
same
time
admits
that
spirit
is
god
tually
declaring
him
good
in
one
instance
and
evil
in
another
law
by
universal
consent
mortal
belief
has
constituted
itself
a
law
to
bind
mortals
to
sickness
sin
and
death
this
customary
belief
is
misnamed
material
law
and
the
individual
who
upholds
it
is
taken
in
theory
and
in
practice
the
law
of
mortal
mind
conjectural
and
speculative
is
made
void
by
the
law
of
immortal
mind
and
false
law
should
be
trampled
under
foot
sickness
from
mortal
mind
if
god
causes
man
to
be
sick
sickness
must
be
good
and
its
opposite
health
must
be
evil
for
all
that
he
makes
is
good
and
will
stand
forever
if
the
transgression
of
god
law
produces
sickness
it
is
right
to
be
sick
and
we
can
not
if
we
would
and
should
not
if
we
could
annul
the
decrees
of
wisdom
it
is
the
transgression
of
a
belief
of
mortal
mind
not
of
a
law
of
matter
nor
of
divine
mind
which
causes
the
belief
of
ness
the
remedy
is
truth
not
matter
the
truth
that
disease
is
if
sickness
is
real
it
belongs
to
immortality
if
true
it
is
a
part
of
truth
would
you
attempt
with
drugs
or
without
to
destroy
a
quality
or
condition
of
truth
but
if
sickness
and
sin
are
illusions
the
awakening
from
this
mortal
dream
or
illusion
will
bring
us
into
health
holiness
and
immortality
this
awakening
is
the
ever
coming
of
christ
the
advanced
appearing
of
truth
which
casts
out
error
and
heals
the
sick
this
is
the
vation
which
comes
through
god
the
divine
principle
love
as
demonstrated
by
jesus
god
never
inconsistent
it
would
be
contrary
to
our
highest
ideas
of
god
to
suppose
him
capable
of
first
arranging
law
and
causation
so
as
to
bring
about
certain
evil
results
and
then
punishing
the
helpless
victims
of
his
lition
for
doing
what
they
could
not
avoid
doing
good
is
not
can
not
be
the
author
of
experimental
sins
god
good
can
no
more
produce
sickness
than
goodness
can
cause
evil
and
health
occasion
disease
mental
narcotics
does
wisdom
make
blunders
which
must
afterwards
be
rectified
by
man
does
a
law
of
god
produce
ness
and
can
man
put
that
law
under
his
feet
by
healing
sickness
according
to
holy
writ
the
sick
are
never
really
healed
by
drugs
hygiene
or
any
material
method
these
merely
evade
the
question
they
are
soothing
syrups
to
put
children
to
sleep
satisfy
mortal
belief
and
quiet
fear
the
true
healing
we
think
that
we
are
healed
when
a
disease
pears
though
it
is
liable
to
reappear
but
we
are
never
thoroughly
healed
until
the
liability
to
be
ill
is
removed
mortal
mind
or
the
mind
of
mortals
being
the
remote
predisposing
and
the
exciting
cause
of
all
suffering
the
cause
of
disease
must
be
obliterated
through
christ
in
divine
science
or
the
physical
senses
will
get
the
victory
destruction
of
all
evil
unless
an
ill
is
rightly
met
and
fairly
overcome
by
truth
the
ill
is
never
conquered
if
god
destroys
not
sin
sickness
and
death
they
are
not
stroyed
in
the
mind
of
mortals
but
seem
to
this
mind
to
be
immortal
what
god
can
not
do
man
need
not
attempt
if
god
heals
not
the
sick
they
are
not
healed
for
no
lesser
power
equals
the
infinite
but
god
truth
life
love
does
heal
the
sick
through
the
prayer
of
the
righteous
if
god
makes
sin
if
good
produces
evil
if
truth
results
in
error
then
science
and
christianity
are
helpless
but
there
are
no
antagonistic
powers
nor
laws
spiritual
or
material
creating
and
governing
man
through
perpetual
warfare
god
is
not
the
author
of
mortal
discords
therefore
we
accept
the
conclusion
that
discords
have
only
a
fabulous
existence
are
mortal
beliefs
which
divine
truth
and
love
destroy
superiority
to
sickness
and
sin
to
hold
yourself
superior
to
sin
because
god
made
you
superior
to
it
and
governs
man
is
true
wisdom
to
fear
sin
is
to
misunderstand
the
power
of
love
and
the
divine
science
of
being
in
man
tion
to
god
to
doubt
his
government
and
distrust
his
omnipotent
care
to
hold
yourself
superior
to
sickness
and
death
is
equally
wise
and
is
in
accordance
with
divine
science
to
fear
them
is
impossible
when
you
fully
apprehend
god
and
know
that
they
are
no
part
of
his
creation
man
governed
by
his
maker
having
no
other
mind
planted
on
the
evangelist
statement
that
all
things
were
made
by
him
the
word
of
god
and
without
him
was
not
anything
made
that
was
made
can
triumph
over
sin
sickness
and
death
denials
of
divine
power
many
theories
relative
to
god
and
man
neither
make
man
harmonious
nor
god
lovable
the
beliefs
we
monly
entertain
about
happiness
and
life
afford
no
scatheless
and
permanent
evidence
of
either
security
for
the
claims
of
harmonious
and
eternal
being
is
found
only
in
divine
science
scripture
informs
us
that
with
god
all
things
are
possible
all
good
is
possible
to
spirit
but
our
alent
theories
practically
deny
this
and
make
healing
possible
only
through
matter
these
theories
must
be
untrue
for
the
scripture
is
true
christianity
is
not
false
but
religions
which
contradict
its
principle
are
false
in
our
age
christianity
is
again
demonstrating
the
power
of
divine
principle
as
it
did
over
nineteen
dred
years
ago
by
healing
the
sick
and
triumphing
over
death
jesus
never
taught
that
drugs
food
air
and
ercise
could
make
a
man
healthy
or
that
they
could
stroy
human
life
nor
did
he
illustrate
these
errors
by
his
practice
he
referred
man
harmony
to
mind
not
to
matter
and
never
tried
to
make
of
none
effect
the
tence
of
god
which
sealed
god
condemnation
of
sin
sickness
and
death
signs
following
in
the
sacred
sanctuary
of
truth
are
voices
of
emn
import
but
we
heed
them
not
it
is
only
when
the
pleasures
and
pains
of
sense
pass
away
in
our
lives
that
we
find
able
signs
of
the
burial
of
error
and
the
resurrection
to
spiritual
life
profession
and
proof
there
is
neither
place
nor
opportunity
in
science
for
error
of
any
sort
every
day
makes
its
demands
upon
us
for
higher
proofs
rather
than
professions
of
christian
power
these
proofs
consist
solely
in
the
destruction
of
sin
sickness
and
death
by
the
power
of
spirit
as
jesus
destroyed
them
this
is
an
element
of
progress
and
progress
is
the
law
of
god
whose
law
mands
of
us
only
what
we
can
certainly

the
of
all

building

purity
the

of

that

it

eternal

mortals
put

it

the

the
one
only
way
there
is

one
way
to

and
christ
in

shows
us
this
way
it
is
to
know
no

to
have
no

of

than
good

his

and
to

is
more
opaque

in

let
us
labor

solve
with
the

they

the
divine
science
of

woven
into

we

triumph
over
sin
and
death
it
crowned
the
strations
of
jesus
with
unsurpassed
power
and
love
but
the
same
mind
which
was
also
in
christ
jesus
must
always
accompany
the
letter
of
science
in
order
to
confirm
and
repeat
the
ancient
demonstrations
of
prophets
and
apostles
that
those
wonders
are
not
more
monly
repeated
arises
not
so
much
from
lack
of
desire
as
from
lack
of
spiritual
growth
mental
telegraphy
the
clay
can
not
reply
to
the
potter
the
head
heart
lungs
and
limbs
do
not
inform
us
that
they
are
dizzy
diseased
consumptive
or
lame
if
this
formation
is
conveyed
mortal
mind
conveys
it
neither
immortal
and
unerring
mind
nor
matter
the
inanimate
substratum
of
mortal
mind
can
carry
on
such
telegraphy
for
god
is
of
purer
eyes
than
to
behold
evil
and
matter
has
neither
intelligence
nor
sensation
annihilation
of
error
truth
has
no
consciousness
of
error
love
has
no
sense
of
hatred
life
has
no
partnership
with
death
truth
life
and
love
are
a
law
of
annihilation
to
everything
unlike
themselves
because
they
declare
nothing
except
god
deformity
and
perfection
sickness
sin
and
death
are
not
the
fruits
of
life
they
are
inharmonies
which
truth
destroys
perfection
does
not
animate
imperfection
inasmuch
as
god
is
good
and
the
fount
of
all
being
he
does
not
produce
moral
or
physical
deformity
therefore
such
deformity
is
not
real
but
is
illusion
the
mirage
of
error
divine
science
reveals
these
grand
facts
on
their
basis
jesus
demonstrated
life
never
fearing
nor
obeying
error
in
any
form
if
we
were
to
derive
all
our
conceptions
of
man
from
what
is
seen
between
the
cradle
and
the
grave
ness
and
goodness
would
have
no
in
man
and
the
worms
would
rob
him
of
the
flesh
but
paul
writes
the
law
of
the
spirit
of
life
in
christ
jesus
hath
made
me
free
from
the
law
of
sin
and
death
man
never
less
than
man
man
undergoing
birth
maturity
and
decay
is
like
the
beasts
and
vegetables
subject
to
laws
of
decay
if
man
were
dust
in
his
earliest
stage
of
ence
we
might
admit
the
hypothesis
that
he
returns
eventually
to
his
primitive
condition
but
man
was
never
more
nor
less
than
man
if
man
flickers
out
in
death
or
springs
from
matter
into
being
there
must
be
an
instant
when
god
is
without
his
entire
manifestation
when
there
is
no
full
reflection
of
the
infinite
mind
man
not
evolved
man
in
science
is
neither
young
nor
old
he
has
neither
birth
nor
death
he
is
not
a
beast
a
vegetable
nor
a
migratory
mind
he
does
not
pass
from
matter
to
mind
from
the
mortal
to
the
mortal
from
evil
to
good
or
from
good
to
evil
such
admissions
cast
us
headlong
into
darkness
and
dogma
even
shakespeare
poetry
pictures
age
as
infancy
as
helplessness
and
decadence
instead
of
assigning
to
man
the
everlasting
grandeur
and
immortality
of
development
power
and
prestige
the
error
of
thinking
that
we
are
growing
old
and
the
benefits
of
destroying
that
illusion
are
illustrated
in
a
sketch
from
the
history
of
an
english
woman
published
in
the
london
medical
magazine
called
the
lancet
perpetual
youth
disappointed
in
love
in
her
early
years
she
became
insane
and
lost
all
account
of
time
believing
that
she
was
still
living
in
the
same
hour
which
parted
her
from
her
lover
taking
no
note
of
years
she
stood
daily
before
the
window
watching
for
her
lover
coming
in
this
mental
state
she
remained
young
having
no
consciousness
of
time
she
literally
grew
no
older
some
american
travellers
saw
her
when
she
was
and
supposed
her
to
be
a
young
woman
she
had
no
face
no
wrinkles
nor
gray
hair
but
youth
sat
gently
on
cheek
and
brow
asked
to
guess
her
age
those
unacquainted
with
her
history
conjectured
that
she
must
be
under
twenty
this
instance
of
youth
preserved
furnishes
a
useful
hint
upon
which
a
franklin
might
work
with
more
tainty
than
when
he
coaxed
the
enamoured
lightning
from
the
clouds
years
had
not
made
her
old
because
she
had
taken
no
cognizance
of
passing
time
nor
thought
of
herself
as
growing
old
the
bodily
results
of
her
belief
that
she
was
young
manifested
the
influence
of
such
a
lief
she
could
not
age
while
believing
herself
young
for
the
mental
state
governed
the
physical
impossibilities
never
occur
one
instance
like
the
foregoing
proves
it
possible
to
be
young
at
and
the
primary
of
that
illustration
makes
it
plain
that
decrepitude
is
not
according
to
law
nor
is
it
a
necessity
of
nature
but
an
illusion
man
reflects
god
the
infinite
never
began
nor
will
it
ever
end
mind
and
its
formations
can
never
be
annihilated
man
is
not
a
pendulum
swinging
between
evil
and
good
joy
and
sorrow
sickness
and
health
life
and
death
life
and
its
faculties
are
not
measured
by
calendars
the
perfect
and
immortal
are
the
eternal
likeness
of
their
maker
man
is
by
no
means
a
material
germ
rising
from
the
imperfect
and
endeavoring
to
reach
spirit
above
his
origin
the
stream
rises
no
higher
than
its
source
the
measurement
of
life
by
solar
years
robs
youth
and
gives
ugliness
to
age
the
radiant
sun
of
virtue
and
truth
coexists
with
being
manhood
is
its
eternal
noon
dimmed
by
a
declining
sun
as
the
physical
and
rial
the
transient
sense
of
beauty
fades
the
radiance
of
spirit
should
dawn
upon
the
enraptured
sense
with
bright
and
imperishable
glories
undesirable
records
never
record
ages
chronological
data
are
no
part
of
the
vast
forever
of
birth
and
death
are
so
many
conspiracies
against
manhood
and
womanhood
except
for
the
error
of
uring
and
limiting
all
that
is
good
and
beautiful
man
would
enjoy
more
than
threescore
years
and
ten
and
still
maintain
his
vigor
freshness
and
promise
man
governed
by
immortal
mind
is
always
beautiful
and
grand
each
succeeding
year
unfolds
wisdom
beauty
and
holiness
true
life
eternal
life
is
eternal
we
should
find
this
out
and
begin
the
demonstration
thereof
life
and
goodness
are
immortal
let
us
then
shape
our
views
of
existence
into
loveliness
freshness
and
continuity
rather
than
into
age
and
blight
acute
and
chronic
beliefs
reproduce
their
own
types
the
acute
belief
of
physical
life
comes
on
at
a
remote
period
and
is
not
so
disastrous
as
the
chronic
belief
eyes

renewed
i
have
seen
age
regain
two
of
the
elements
it
had
lost
sight
and
teeth
a
woman
of
whom
i
knew
had
a
return
of
sight
another
woman
at
ninety
had
new
teeth
incisors
cuspids
cuspids
and
one

one
man
at
sixty
had
retained
his
full
set
of

and
lower

without
a
decaying
cavity
eternal
beauty
beauty
as
well
as
truth
is
eternal
but
the
beauty
of
material
things
passes
away
fading
and
fleeting
as
mortal
belief
custom
education
and
fashion
form
the
transient
standards
of
mortals
mortality
exempt
from
age
or
decay
has
a
glory
of
its
own
the
radiance
of
soul
immortal
men
and
women
are
models
of
spiritual
sense
drawn
by
perfect
mind
and
reflecting
those
higher
conceptions
of
loveliness
which
transcend
all
material
sense
the
divine
loveliness
comeliness
and
grace
are
independent
of
matter
ing
possesses
its
qualities
before
they
are
perceived
manly
beauty
is
a
thing
of
life
which
dwells
forever
in
the
eternal
mind
and
flects
the
charms
of
his
goodness
in
expression
form
outline
and
color
it
is
love
which
paints
the
petal
with
myriad
hues
glances
in
the
warm
sunbeam
arches
the
cloud
with
the
bow
of
beauty
blazons
the
night
with
starry
gems
and
covers
earth
with

the
embellishments
of
the
person
are
poor
substitutes
for
the
charms
of
being
shining
resplendent
and
eternal
over
age
and
decay
the
recipe
for
beauty
is
to
have
less
illusion
and
more
soul
to
retreat
from
the
belief
of
pain
or
pleasure
in
the
body
into
the
unchanging
calm
and

of

love
never

of

its
halo
rests
upon

one
marvels
that
a
friend
can
ever
seem
less
than
beautiful
men
and
women
of
riper
years
and
larger
lessons
ought
to
ripen
into
health
and
immortality
instead
of
lapsing
into
darkness
or
gloom
immortal
mind
feeds
the
body
with
supernal
freshness
and
fairness
supplying
it
with
beautiful
images
of
thought
and
destroying
the
woes
of
sense
which
each
day
brings
to
a
nearer
tomb
mental
sculpture
the
sculptor
turns
from
the
marble
to
his
model
in
order
to
perfect
his
conception
we
are
all
sculptors
working
at
various
forms
moulding
and
ing
thought
what
is
the
model
before
mortal
mind
is
it
imperfection
joy
sorrow
sin
suffering
have
you
accepted
the
mortal
model
are
you
ducing
it
then
you
are
haunted
in
your
work
by
vicious
sculptors
and
hideous
forms
do
you
not
hear
from
all
mankind
of
the
imperfect
model
the
world
is
holding
it
before
your
gaze
continually
the
result
is
that
you
are
liable
to
follow
those
lower
patterns
limit
your
work
and
adopt
into
your
experience
the
angular
outline
and
deformity
of
matter
models
perfect
models
to
remedy
this
we
must
first
turn
our
gaze
in
the
right
direction
and
then
walk
that
way
we
must
form
perfect
models
in
thought
and
look
at
them
continually
or
we
shall
never
carve
them
out
in
grand
and
noble
lives
let
unselfishness
goodness
mercy
justice
health
holiness
love
the
kingdom
of
heaven
reign
within
us
and
sin
disease
and
death
will
diminish
until
they
finally
disappear
let
us
accept
science
relinquish
all
theories
based
on
give
up
imperfect
models
and
illusive
ideals
and
so
let
us
have
one
god
one
mind
and
that
one
perfect
producing
his
own
models
of
excellence
renewed
selfhood
let
the
male
and
female
of
god
creating
appear
let
us
feel
the
divine
energy
of
spirit
bringing
us
into
newness
of
life
and
recognizing
no
mortal
nor
material
power
as
able
to
destroy
let
us
joice
that
we
are
subject
to
the
divine
powers
that
be
such
is
the
true
science
of
being
any
other
theory
of
life
or
god
is
delusive
and
mythological
mind
is
not
the
author
of
matter
and
the
creator
of
ideas
is
not
the
creator
of
illusions
either
there
is
no
omnipotence
or
omnipotence
is
the
only
power
god
is
the
infinite
and
infinity
never
began
will
never
end
and
includes
nothing
unlike
god
whence
then
is
soulless
matter
illusive
dreams
life
is
like
christ
the
same
yesterday
and
and
forever
organization
and
time
have
nothing
to
do
with
life
you
say
i
dreamed
last
night
what
a
mistake
is
that
the
i
is
spirit
god
never
slumbers
and
his
likeness
never
dreams
mortals
are
the
adam
dreamers
sleep
and
apath
are
phases
of
the
dream
that
life
stance
and
intelligence
are
material
the
mortal
dream
is
sometimes
nearer
the
fact
of
being
than
are
the
thoughts
of
mortals
when
awake
the
has
less
matter
as
its
accompaniment
it
throws
off
some
material
fetters
it
falls
short
of
the
skies
but
makes
its
mundane
flights
quite
ethereal
philosophical
blunders
man
is
the
reflection
of
soul
he
is
the
direct
site
of
material
sensation
and
there
is
but
one
ego
we
run
into
error
when
we
divide
soul
into
souls
multiply
mind
into
minds
and
suppose
error
to
be
mind
then
mind
to
be
in
matter
and
matter
to
be
a
lawgiver
unintelligence
to
act
like
intelligence
and
tality
to
be
the
matrix
of
immortality
spirit
the
one
ego
mortal
existence
is
a
dream
mortal
existence
has
no
real
entity
but
saith
it
is
i
spirit
is
the
ego
which
never
dreams
but
understands
all
things
which
never
errs
and
is
ever
conscious
which
never
believes
but
knows
which
is
never
born
and
never
dies
spiritual
man
is
the
likeness
of
this
ego
man
is
not
god
but
like
a
ray
of
light
which
comes
from
the
sun
man
the
outcome
of
god
reflects
god
mortal
existence
a
dream
mortal
body
and
mind
are
one
and
that
one
is
called
man
but
a
mortal
is
not
man
for
man
is
immortal
a
mortal
may
be
weary
or
pained
enjoy
or
suffer
according
to
the
dream
he
entertains
in
sleep
when
that
dream
vanishes
the
mortal
finds
himself
experiencing
none
of
these
to
the
observer
the
body
lies
listless
undisturbed
and
tionless
and
the
mind
seems
to
be
absent
now
i
ask
is
there
any
more
reality
in
the
waking
dream
of
mortal
existence
than
in
the
sleeping
dream
there
can
not
be
since
whatever
appears
to
be
a
mortal
man
is
a
mortal
dream
take
away
the
mortal
mind
and
matter
has
no
more
sense
as
a
man
than
it
has
as
a
tree
but
the
spiritual
real
man
is
immortal
upon
this
stage
of
existence
goes
on
the
dance
of
mortal
mind
mortal
thoughts
chase
one
another
like
snowflakes
and
drift
to
the
ground
science
reveals
life
as
not
being
at
the
mercy
of
death
nor
will
science
admit
that
ness
is
ever
the
sport
of
circumstance
error
error
is
not
real
hence
it
is
not
more
imperative
as
it
hastens
towards
the
belief
of
mortal
mind
apparent
as
an
abscess
should
not
grow
more
painful
before
it
rates
neither
should
a
fever
become
more
severe
before
it
ends
illusion
of
death
fright
is
so
great
at
certain
stages
of
mortal
belief
as
to
drive
belief
into
new
paths
in
the
illusion
of
death
mortals
wake
to
the
knowledge
of
two
facts
that
they
are
not
dead
that
they
have
but
passed
the
portals
of
a
new
belief
truth
works
out
the
nothingness
of
error
in
just
these
ways
sickness
as
well
as
sin
is
an
error
that
christ
truth
alone
can
destroy
mortal
mind
disappearance
we
must
learn
how
mankind
govern
the
body
whether
through
faith
in
hygiene
in
drugs
or
in
power
we
should
learn
whether
they
govern
the
body
through
a
belief
in
the
necessity
of
sickness
and
death
sin
and
pardon
or
govern
it
from
the
higher
understanding
that
the
divine
mind
makes
perfect
acts
upon
the
human
mind
through
truth
leads
the
human
mind
to
relinquish
all
error
to
find
the
divine
mind
to
be
the
only
mind
and
the
healer
of
sin
disease
death
this
process
of
higher
spiritual
understanding
improves
mankind
until
error
disappears
and
nothing
is
left
which
deserves
to
perish
or
to
be
punished
spiritual
ignorance
ignorance
like
intentional
wrong
is
not
science
ignorance
must
be
seen
and
corrected
before
we
can
tain
harmony
inharmonious
beliefs
which
rob
mind
calling
it
matter
and
deify
their
own
notions
imprison
themselves
in
what
they
create
they
are
at
war
with
science
and
as
our
master
said
if
a
kingdom
be
divided
against
itself
that
kingdom
can
not
stand
human
ignorance
of
mind
and
of
the
recuperative
energies
of
truth
occasions
the
only
skepticism
ing
the
pathology
and
theology
of
christian
science
eternal
man
recognized
when
false
human
beliefs
learn
even
a
little
of
their
own
falsity
they
begin
to
disappear
a
knowledge
of
error
and
of
its
operations
must
precede
that
understanding
of
truth
which
destroys
error
until
the
entire
mortal
material
error
finally
disappears
and
the
eternal
verity
man
created
by
and
of
spirit
is
understood
and
recognized
as
the
true
likeness
of
his
maker
the
false
evidence
of
material
sense
contrasts
strikingly
with
the
testimony
of
spirit
material
sense
lifts
its
voice
with
the
arrogance
of
reality
and
says
testimony
of
sense
i
am
wholly
dishonest
and
no

knoweth
it
i
can
cheat

commit

elude

i

a

an
accident
the
law
of

at

annihilate
my
peace
for
all
my

also
if

you

without

from

do
not

in
any
supposed

for

knowing
as
you
ought
to
know
that
god
never
requires
obedience
to
a
material
law
for
no
such

exists
the
belief
in
sin

death
is
stroyed
by
the

is
the

not

this

no

a

a

finiteness

a

originating

must

and
finite
infinite

is

is
the

emanating

if

then
all

this

if

the
theory
that

is
not

is
pantheistic
erodoxy
which
ultimates

sin

it
is
the
belief
in

a

a

and
a

this

shallow
pantheism
mind

the

hence
the

mind
is
not
the
father
of

the
material
senses
and
human
conceptions
would
translate
spiritual
ideas
into
material
beliefs
and
would
say
that
an
anthropomorphic
god
instead
of
infinite
principle
in
other
words
divine
love
is
the
father
of

who
hath

finite

manifests
all
sorts
of
errors
and
thus
proves
the
material
theory
of

in

to
be
the
antipode
of

who
hath
found
finite
life
or
love
sufficient
to
meet
the
demands
of
human

to
still
the

infinite

would
lose

as

eternal

omnipotent
truth
infinite

impossible
it
would
require
an
infinite

to
contain

indeed
the
phrase
involves
a
tradiction
of
terms
finite
man
can
not
be
the
image

of
the
infinite
god
a
mortal
corporeal
or
finite
conception
of

can
not
embrace
the

hence
the
unsatisfied
human
craving
for
something
better
higher
holier
than
is
afforded
by
a
material
belief
in

the

man

the

thus
begin

for
he

for
he

the

man

the

the

expressed
in

who
threw
upon

the

and
lifted
their
lives
higher

the

unreality

the

we
can
not

the

we

behold

must
look

where

the

in
the
unsearchable

we
must
look

we
must
act
as
possessing
all

gain
more
correct
views

multitudinous

of

which
before
were

will

evidences
by
which

can
recognize

comes
from

man
understands

in

as
his

mortals
must
gravitate

their

and
aims
grow
spiritual
they
must
near
the
broader
interpretations
of
being
and
gain
some
proper
sense
of
the

in
order
that
sin

mortality
may
be
put
off

forsaking

by
no

absorption

a

a

a

mortal
birth

the

represent
birth
as

as

as
if
man
were
a
weed
growing
apace
or
a
flower
withered
by
the

and
nipped
by
untimely
frosts
but
this
is
true
only
of
a
mortal
not
of
a
man
in

image

the
truth
of

is
perennial
and
the

obsolete

who
that

the
loss

has
not

the

even
before
we
discover
what

the

the

the

quickly
inform
us
that
the

of

are
mortal
and
that
joy
is
spiritual
decapitation
of
error
the
pains
of
sense
are
salutary
if
they
wrench
away
false
pleasurable
beliefs
and
transplant
the
affections
from
sense
to
soul
where
the
creations
of
god
are
good
rejoicing
the

such
is
the
sword
of

with
which

decapitates

materiality
giving
place
to

higher
individuality

uses

would
existence
without

be
to
you
a

then
the
time
will
come
when
you
will
be
solitary
left
without
sympathy
but
this
seeming
vacuum
is
already
filled
with
divine
love
when
this
hour
of
development
comes
even
if
you
cling
to
a
sense
of
personal
joys
spiritual
love
will
force
you
to
accept
what

your

betray
and

exalt

the
author
has
experienced
the
foregoing
prophecy
and
its
blessings
thus
he
teaches
mortals
to
lay
down
their
fleshliness
and
gain
spirituality
this
is
done
through
universal
love
is
the
divine
way
in
christian
science
the
sinner
makes
his
own
hell
by
doing
evil
and
the
saint
his
own
heaven
by
doing
right
the
opposite
secutions
of
material
sense
aiding
evil
with
evil
would
deceive
the
very
elect
beatific

mortals
must
follow
jesus
sayings
and
his
tions
which
dominate
the
flesh
perfect
and
infinite
mind
enthroned
is
heaven
the
evil
beliefs
which
originate
in
mortals
are
hell
man
is
the
idea

he
reflects
the
beatific
presence
illuming
the

with
light
man
is
deathless
spiritual
he
is
above
sin
or
frailty
he
does
not
cross
the
barriers
of
time
into
the
vast
forever
of
life
but
he
coexists
with
god
and
the
universe
the
infinitude
of
god
every
object
in
material
thought
will
be
destroyed
but
the
spiritual
idea
whose
substance
is
in

is
eternal
the
offspring
of
god
start
not
from

or
ephemeral
dust
they
are
in

of

divine

and
so
forever
continue
god
is
one
the
allness
of
deity
is
his
oneness
generically
man
is
one
and
specifically
man
means
all
men
it
is
generally
conceded
that
god
is

the

christian
scientists
understand
that
in
a
religious
sense
they
have
the
same
authority
for
the
appellative

as
for
that
of

the

waymarks
to
eternal
truth
when
examined
in
the
light
of
divine
science
mortals
present
more
than
is
detected
upon
the
surface
since
inverted
thoughts
and
erroneous
beliefs
must
be
counterfeits
of
truth
thought
is
rowed
from
a
higher
source
than
matter
and
by
reversal
errors
serve
as

to

all

the

looking

to

like
the

with

confusion

this

cal
systems
afford
no
substantial
aid
to
scientific

for
their
arguments
are
based
on
the
false
testimony
of
the
material

as
well
as
on

these
systems
are
one
and
all
pantheistic
and
savor
of
demonium
a
house
divided
against
itself
from

the
supposed

sulted

divine
metaphysics
human

christian
science
makes

the
first
is
error
the
latter
is

metaphysics
is
above
physics
and
matter
does
not
enter
into
metaphysical
ises
or
conclusions
the
categories
of
metaphysics
rest
on
one
basis
the
divine
mind
metaphysics
resolves
things
into
thoughts
and
exchanges
the
objects
of
sense
for
the
ideas
of
soul
these
ideas
are
perfectly
real
and
tangible
to
spiritual
consciousness
and
they
have
this
advantage
over
the
jects
and
thoughts
of
material
sense
they
are
good
and
eternal
biblical
foundations
the
testimony
of
the
material
senses
is
neither
lute
nor
divine
i
therefore
plant
myself
unreservedly
on
the
teachings
of
jesus
of
his
apostles
of
the
prophets
and
on
the
testimony
of
the
science
of
mind
other
foundations
there
are
none
all
other
systems
systems
based
wholly
or
partly
on
knowledge
gained
through
the
material
senses
are
reeds
shaken

not
houses

rejected
theories
the
theories
i
combat
are
these
that
all
is
matter
that
matter
originates
in
mind
and
is
as
real
as
mind
possessing
intelligence
and
life
the
first
theory
that
matter
is
everything
is
quite
as
reasonable
as
the
second
that
mind
and
matter
coexist
and
cooperate
one
only
of
the
following
statements
can
be
true
that
everything
is
matter
that
thing
is
mind
which
one
is
it
matter
and
mind
are
opposites
one
is
contrary
to
the
other
in
its
very
nature
and
essence
hence
both
not
be
real
if
one
is
real
the
other
must
be
unreal
only
by
understanding
that
there
is
but
one
power
not
two
powers
matter
and
mind
are
scientific
and
logical
conclusions
reached
few
deny
the
hypothesis
that
telligence
apart
from
man
and
matter
governs
the
verse
and
it
is
generally
admitted
that
this
intelligence
is
the
eternal
mind
or
divine
principle
love
prophetic
ignorance
the
prophets
of
old
looked
for
something
higher
than
the
systems
of
their
times
hence
their
sight
of
the
new
dispensation
of
truth
but
they
knew
not
what
would
be
the
precise
nature
of
the
teaching
and
demonstration
of
god
divine
mind
in
his
more
infinite
meanings
the
demonstration
which
was
to
destroy
sin
sickness
and
death
establish
the
definition
of
omnipotence
and
maintain
the
science
of
spirit
the
pride
of
priesthood
is
the
prince
of
this
world
it
has
nothing
in
christ
meekness
and
charity
have
divine
authority
mortals
think
wickedly
consequently
they
are
wicked
they
think
sickly
thoughts
and
so
become
sick
if
sin
makes
sinners
truth
and
love
alone
can
unmake
them
if
a
sense
of
disease
produces
suffering
and
a
sense
of
ease
antidotes
suffering
disease
is
mental
not
material
hence
the
fact
that
the
human
mind
alone
suffers
is
sick
and
that
the
divine
mind
alone
heals
the
life
of
christ
jesus
was
not
miraculous
but
it
was
indigenous
to
his
spirituality
the
good
soil
wherein
the
seed
of
truth
springs
up
and
bears
much
fruit
christianity
is
the
chain
of
scientific
being
reappearing
in
all
ages
maintaining
its
obvious
correspondence
with
the
scriptures
and
uniting
all
periods
in
the
design
of
god
neither
emasculation
illusion
nor
insubordination
exists
in
divine
science
jesus
instructed
his
disciples
whereby
to
heal
the
sick
through
mind
instead
of
matter
he
knew
that
the
losophy
science
and
proof
of
christianity
were
in
truth
casting
out
all
inharmony
studious
disciples
in
latin
the
word
rendered
signifies
student
and
the
word
indicates
that
the
power
of
healing
was
not
a
supernatural
gift
to
those
learners
but
the
result
of
their
cultivated
spiritual
ing
of
the
divine
science
which
their
master
demonstrated
by
healing
the
sick
and
sinning
hence
the
universal
plication
of
his
saying
neither
pray
i
for
these
alone
but
for
them
also
which
shall
believe
on
me
understand
me
through
their
word
new
testament
basis
our
master
said
but
the
comforter
shall
teach
you
all
things
when
the
science
of
christianity
appears
it
will
lead
you
into
all
truth
the
sermon
on
the
mount
is
the
essence
of
this
science
and
the
eternal
life
not
the
death
of
jesus
is
its
outcome
modern
evangel
those
who
are
willing
to
leave
their
nets
or
to
cast
them
on
the
right
side
for
truth
have
the
opportunity
now
as
aforetime
to
learn
and
to
practise
christian
healing
the
scriptures
contain
it
the
spiritual
import
of
the
word
imparts
this
power
but
as
paul
says
how
shall
they
hear
without
a
preacher
and
how
shall
they
preach
except
they
be
sent
if
sent
how
shall
they
preach
convert
and
heal
multitudes
except
the
people
hear
spirituality
of
scripture
the
spiritual
sense
of
truth
must
be
gained
before
truth
can
be
understood
this
sense
is
assimilated
only
as
we
are
honest
unselfish
loving
and
meek
in
the
soil
of
an
honest
and
good
heart
the
seed
must
be
sown
else
it
beareth
not
much
fruit
for
the
swinish
element
in
human
nature
uproots
it
jesus
said
ye
do
err
not
knowing
the
scriptures
the
spiritual
sense
of
the
scriptures
brings
out
the
scientific
sense
and
is
the
new
tongue
referred
to
in
the
last
chapter
of
gospel
jesus
parable
of
the
sower
shows
the
care
our
master
took
not
to
impart
to
dull
ears
and
gross
hearts
the
spiritual
teachings
which
dulness
and
grossness
could
not
accept
reading
the
thoughts
of
the
people
he
said
give
not
that
which
is
holy
unto
the
dogs
neither
cast
ye
your
pearls
before
swine
unspiritual
contrasts
it
is
the
spiritualization
of
thought
and
christianization
of
daily
life
in
contrast
with
the
results
of
the
ghastly
farce
of
material
existence
it
is
chastity
and
purity
in
contrast
with
the
downward
tendencies
and
earthward
gravitation
of
sensualism
and
impurity
which
really
attest
the
divine
origin
and
operation
of
tian
science
the
triumphs
of
christian
science
are
corded
in
the
destruction
of
error
and
evil
from
which
are
propagated
the
dismal
beliefs
of

science
as
demonstrated
by
jesus
alone
reveals
the
natural
divine
principle
of
science
matter
and
its
claims
of
sin
sickness
and
death
are
contrary
to
god
and
can
not
emanate
from
him
there
is
no
truth
the
physical
senses
can
take
no
cognizance
of
god
and
spiritual
truth
human
belief
has
sought
out
many
inventions
but
not
one
of
them
can
solve
the
problem
of
being
without
the
divine
ciple
of
divine
science
deductions
from
material
potheses
are
not
scientific
they
differ
from
real
science
because
they
are
not
based
on
the
divine
law
science
sense
divine
science
reverses
the
false
testimony
of
the
terial
senses
and
thus
tears
away
the
dations
of
error
hence
the
enmity
between
science
and
the
senses
and
the
impossibility
of
attaining
perfect
understanding
till
the
errors
of
sense
are
eliminated
the
laws
of
matter
and
of
medical
science
have
never
made
mortals
whole
harmonious
and
immortal
man
is
harmonious
when
governed
by
soul
hence
the
importance
of
understanding
the
truth
of
being
which
reveals
the
laws
of
spiritual
existence
spiritual
law
the
only
law
god
never
ordained
a
material
law
to
annul
the
spiritual
law
if
there
were
such
a
material
law
it
would
oppose
the
supremacy
of
spirit
god
and
impugn
the
wisdom
of
the
creator
jesus
walked
on
the
waves
fed
the
multitude
healed
the
sick
and
raised
the
dead
in
direct
opposition
to
material
laws
his
acts
were
the
demonstration
of
science
overcoming
the
false
claims
of
material
sense
or
law
material
knowledge
illusive
science
shows
that
material
conflicting
mortal
ions
and
beliefs
emit
the
effects
of
error
at
all
times
but
this
atmosphere
of
mortal
mind
can
not
be
destructive
to
morals
and
health
when
it
is
opposed
promptly
and
sistently
by
christian
science
truth
and
love
antidote
this
mental
miasma
and
thus
invigorate
and

istence
unnecessary
knowledge
gained
from
the
five

is
only
temporal
the
tion
of
mortal

the
offspring
of

not
of
soul
spirit
and
symbolizes
all
that
is
evil
and
perishable
as
it
is
commonly
called
is
not
really
natural
nor
scientific
because
it
is
deduced
from
the
evidence
of
the
material
senses
ideas
on
the
trary
are
born
of
spirit
and
are
not
mere
inferences
drawn
from
material
premises
five
senses
deceptive
the
senses
of
spirit
abide
in
love
and
they
strate
truth
and

hence
christianity
and
the
ence
which
expounds
it
are
based
on
spiritual
understanding
and
they
supersede
the
called
laws
of
matter
jesus
demonstrated
this
great
verity
when
what
we
erroneously
term
the
five
physical
senses
are
misdirected
they
are
simply
the
manifested
beliefs
of
mortal
mind
which
affirm
that
life
substance
and

are
material
instead
of

these
false

their

spirit
the

no

and

a

of

would
ignore
ent
and

this
shows
that
matter
did
not
originate
in
god
spirit
and
is
not
eternal
therefore
matter
is
neither
substantial
living
nor
intelligent
the
of
divine
science
is
that
god
spirit
is
and
that
there
is
no
other
might
nor

that
god
is
love
and
therefore
he
is
divine
principle
divine
synonyms
to
grasp
the
reality
and
order
of
being
in
its

you
must
begin
by
reckoning
god
as
the
divine
principle
of
all
that
really
is
spirit
life
truth
love
combine
as
one
and
are
the
scriptural
names
for
god
all

mortality
cause

to

these
are
his
attributes
the

manifestations
of
the

principle
love
no

is
wise
but
his
wisdom
no
truth
is
true
no
love
is
lovely
no
life
is

but
the

no
good
is
but
the

god
bestows
the
divine
completeness
divine
metaphysics
as
revealed
to
spiritual
ing
shows
clearly
that
all
is
mind
and
that
mind
is
god
omnipotence
omnipresence
omniscience
that
is
all

all

all

hence
all
is
in

the

our
material
human
theories
are
destitute
of

the
true

of
god
is

it
robs
the

it
destroys
the

such

and
i
have
found
a

when
the

they
unfold
the

of

the

harmony
in

discord
is

if
god

admitted
to

there
ceases
to
be
any

when
we
learn
in

how
to
be

even
as
our

is
perfect
thought
is
turned
into
new

towards
the

material

the

discord

harmony

like

nature

inform
us
that

divine
science
does
not
gather
grapes

gence
never

matter

therefore
can
not
spring
from

to
all
that

this

where
the

says
that

returns

the

into
its

unreality
matter
never
produces
mind
the

never
produces
the
mortal
good
can
not
result
in
evil
as
god
himself
is
good
and
is
spirit
goodness
and
spirituality
must
be
mortal
their
opposites
evil

are
mortal
error
and
error
has
no
creator
if
goodness
and
uality
are
real
evil
and
materiality
are
unreal
and
not
be
the
outcome
of
an
infinite

good
natural
history
presents
vegetables

as
preserving
their
original

like

like
a
mineral
is
not
produced
by
a
vegetable
nor
the
man
by
the
brute
in
reproduction
the
order
of
genus
and
species
is
preserved
throughout
the
entire
round
of
nature
this
points
to
the
spiritual
truth
and
science
of
being
error
relies
upon
a
reversal
of
this
order
asserts
that
spirit
produces
matter
and
matter
produces
all
the
ills
of
flesh
and
therefore
that
good
is
the
origin
of
evil
these
suppositions
contradict
even
the
order
of
material
science
material
error
the
realm
of
the
real
is
spirit
the
unlikeness
of
spirit
is
matter
and
the
opposite
of
the
real
is
not
divine
it
is
a
human
concept
matter
is
an
error
of

this
error
in
the
premise
leads
to
errors
in
the
conclusion
in
every
statement
into
which
it
enters
nothing
we
can
say
or
believe
regarding

is

for
matter
is
temporal
and
is
therefore
a

nomenon
a
human

sometimes

is
spirit
the
source

creator
of

science
veals
nothing
in

out
of
which
to
create

divine
metaphysics
explains
away
matter
spirit
is
the
only
substance
and
consciousness
recognized
by
divine
science
the
material
senses
oppose
this
but
there
are
no
material
senses
for
matter
has
no
mind
in
spirit
there
is
no
matter
even
as
in
truth
there
is
no
error
and
in
good
no
evil
it
is
a
false
supposition
the
notion
that
there
is
real
matter
the
opposite
of
spirit
spirit
god
is
infinite
all
spirit
can
have
no
opposite
one
cause
supreme
that
matter
is
substantial
or
has
life
and
sensation
is
one
of
the
false
beliefs
of
mortals
and
exists
only
in
a
supposititious
mortal
consciousness
hence
as
we
approach
spirit
and
truth
we
lose
the
consciousness
of
matter
the
admission
that
there
can
be
material
substance
requires
another
admission
namely
that
spirit
is
not
infinite
and
that
matter
is
creative
and
eternal
from
this
it
would
follow
that
there
are
two
eternal
causes
warring
forever
with
each
other
and
yet
we
say
that
spirit
is
supreme
and
the
belief
of
the
eternity
of
matter
contradicts
the
demonstration
of
life
as
spirit
and
leads
to
the
sion
that
if
man
is
material
he
originated
in
matter
and
must
return
to
dust
logic
which
would
prove
his
nihilation
substance
is
spirit
all
that
we
term
sin
sickness
and
death
is
a
mortal
belief
we
define
matter
as
error
because
it
is
the
site
of
life
substance
and
intelligence
ter
with
its

can
not
be

if

is

the

to
understand
spirit
they
give
up
the
belief
that
there
is
any
true
existence
apart
from
god
source
of
all
life
and
action
mind
is
the
source
of
all
movement
and
there
is
no
inertia
to
retard
or
check
its
perpetual
and
harmonious
action
mind
is
the
same
life
love
and
dom
yesterday
and
and
forever
matter
and
its
effects
sin
sickness
and
death
are
states
of
mortal
mind
which
act
react
and
then
come
to
a
stop
they
are
not
facts
of
mind
they
are
not
ideas
but
illusions
principle
is
absolute
it
admits
of
no
error
but
rests
upon
understanding
but
what
say
prevalent
theories
they
insist
that
life
or
god
is
one
and
the
same
with
material
life
called
they
speak
of
both
truth
and
error
as
and
of
good
and
evil
as
they
claim
that
to
be
life
which
is
but
the
objective
state
of
material
sense
such
as
the
structural
life
of
the
tree
and
of
material
man
and
deem
this
the
manifestation
of
the
one
life
god
spiritual
structure
this
false
belief
as
to
what
really
constitutes
life
so
detracts
from
god
character
and
nature
that
the
true
sense
of
his
power
is
lost
to
all
who
cling
to
this
falsity
the
divine
principle
or
life
not
be
practically
demonstrated
in
length
of
days
as
it
was
by
the
patriarchs
unless
its
science
be
accurately
stated
we
must
receive
the
divine
principle
in
the
standing
and
live
it
in
daily
life
and
unless
we
so
do
we
can
no
more
demonstrate
science
than
we
can
teach
and
illustrate
geometry
by
calling
a
curve
a
straight
line
or
a
straight
line
a
sphere
are
mentality
immortality
consciousness
resident
in
matter
it
is
not
rational
to
say
that
mind
is
infinite
but
dwells
in
finiteness
in
matter
or
that
matter
is
infinite
and
the
medium
of
mind
mind
never
limited
if
god
were
limited
to
man
or
matter
or
if
the
infinite
could
be
circumscribed
within
the
finite
god
would
be
corporeal
and
unlimited
mind
would
seem
to
spring
from
a
limited
body
but
this
is
an
impossibility
infinite
mind
can
have
no
and
can
return
to
no
limit
it
can
never
be
in
bonds
nor
be
fully
manifested
through
corporeality
material
recognition
impossible
is
god
image
or
likeness
matter
or
a
mortal
sin
sickness
and
death
can
matter
recognize
mind
can
infinite
mind
recognize
matter
can
the
infinite
dwell
in
the
finite
or
know
aught
like
the
infinite
can
deity
be
known
through
the
material
senses
can
the
material
senses
which
ceive
no
direct
evidence
of
spirit
give
correct
testimony
as
to
spiritual
life
truth
and
love
the
answer
to
all
these
questions
must
forever
be
in
the
negative
our
physical
insensibility
to
spirit
the
physical
senses
can
obtain
no
proof
of
god
they
can
neither
see
spirit
through
the
eye
nor
hear
it
through
the
ear
nor
can
they
feel
taste
or
smell
spirit
even
the
more
subtile
and
misnamed
terial
elements
are
beyond
the
cognizance
of
these
senses
and
are
known
only
by
the
effects
monly
attributed
to
them
according
to
christian
science
the
only
real
senses
of
man
are
spiritual
emanating
from
divine
mind
thought
passes
from
god
to
man
but
neither
sensation
nor
report
goes
from
material
body
to
mind
the
tercommunication
is
always
from
god
to
his
idea
man
matter
is
not
sentient
and
can
not
be
cognizant
of
good
or
of
evil
of
pleasure
or
of
pain
man
ality
is
not
material
this
science
of
being
obtains
not
alone
hereafter
in
what
men
call
paradise
but
here
and
now
it
is
the
great
fact
of
being
for
time
and
eternity
the
human
counterfeit
what
then
is
the
material
personality
which
suffers
sins
and
dies
it
is
not
man
the
image
and
likeness
of
god
but
man
counterfeit
the
inverted
likeness
the
called
sin
sickness
and
death
the
unreality
of
the
claim
that
a
mortal
is
the
true
image
of
god
is
illustrated
by
the
opposite
tures
of
spirit
and
matter
mind
and
body
for
one
is
intelligence
while
the
other
is
material
misconceptions
is
god
a
physical
personality
spirit
is
not
physical
the
belief
that
a
material
body
is
man
is
a
false
ception
of
man
the
time
has
come
for
a
finite
conception
of
the
infinite
and
of
a
terial
body
as
the
seat
of
mind
to
give
place
to
a
diviner
sense
of
intelligence
and
its
manifestations
to
the
better
understanding
that
science
gives
of
the
supreme
being
or
divine
principle
and
idea
salvation
is
through
reform
by
interpreting
god
as
a
corporeal
saviour
but
not
as
the
saving
principle
or
divine
love
we
shall
continue
to
seek
salvation
through
pardon
and
not
through
reform
and
resort
to
matter
instead
of
spirit
for
the
cure
of
the
sick
as
mortals
reach
through
knowledge
of
christian
science
a
higher
sense
they
will
seek
to
learn
not
from
matter
but
from
the
divine
principle
god
how
to
demonstrate
the
christ
truth
as
the
healing
and
saving
power
it
is
essential
to
understand
instead
of
believe
what
relates
most
nearly
to
the
happiness
of
being
to
seek
truth
through
belief
in
a
human
doctrine
is
not
to
derstand
the
infinite
we
must
not
seek
the
immutable
and
immortal
through
the
finite
mutable
and
mortal
and
so
depend
upon
belief
instead
of
demonstration
for
this
is
fatal
to
a
knowledge
of
science
the
ing
of
truth
gives
full
faith
in
truth
and
spiritual
derstanding
is
better
than
all
burnt
offerings
the
master
said
no
man
cometh
unto
the
father
the
divine
principle
of
being
but
by
me
christ
life
truth
love
for
christ
says
i
am
the
way
physical
causation
was
put
aside
from
first
to
last
by
this
original
man
jesus
he
knew
that
the
divine
principle
love
creates
and
governs
all
that
is
real
goodness
a
portion
of
god
in
the
saxon
and
twenty
other
tongues
is
the
term
for
god
the
scriptures
declare
all
that
he
made
to
be
good
like
himself
good
in
principle
and
in
idea
therefore
the
spiritual
universe
is
good
and
reflects
god
as
he
is
spiritual
thoughts
god
thoughts
are
perfect
and
eternal
are
substance
and
life
material
and
temporal
thoughts
are
human
involving
error
and
since
god
spirit
is
the
only
cause
they
lack
a
divine
cause
the
temporal
and
material
are
not
then
creations
of
spirit
they
are
but
counterfeits
of
the
spiritual
and
eternal
transitory
thoughts
are
the
antipodes
of
everlasting
truth
though
by
the
supposition
of
opposite
qualities
error
must
also
say
i
am
true
but
by
this
saying
error
the
lie
destroys
itself
sin
sickness
and
death
are
comprised
in
human
terial
belief
and
belong
not
to
the
divine
mind
they
are
without
a
real
origin
or
existence
they
have
neither
principle
nor
permanence
but
belong
with
all
that
is
material
and
temporal
to
the
nothingness
of
error
which
simulates
the
creations
of
truth
all
creations
of
spirit
are
eternal
but
creations
of
matter
must
return
to
dust
error
supposes
man
to
be
both
mental
and
material
divine
science
contradicts
this
postulate
and
maintains
man
spiritual
identity
divine
allness
we
call
the
absence
of
truth
truth
and
error
are
unlike
in
science
truth
is
divine
and
the
god
can
have
no
unlikeness
did
god
truth
create
error
no
doth
a
fountain
send
forth
at
the
same
place
sweet
water
and
bitter
god
being
everywhere
and
how
can
he
be
absent
or
suggest
the
absence
of
omnipresence
and
omnipotence
how
can
there
be
more
than
neither
understanding
nor
truth
accompanies
error
nor
is
error
the
offshoot
of
mind
evil
calls
itself
thing
when
it
is
nothing
it
saith
i
am
man
but
i
am
not
the
image
and
likeness
of
god
whereas
the
tures
declare
that
man
was
made
in
god
likeness
error
unveiled
error
is
false
mortal
belief
it
is
illusion
without
itual
identity
or
foundation
and
it
has
no
real
existence
the
supposition
that
life
substance
and
telligence
are
matter
or
it
is
an
error
matter
is
neither
a
thing
nor
a
person
but
merely
the
objective
supposition
of
spirit
opposite
the
five
rial
senses
testify
to
truth
and
error
as
united
in
a
mind
both
good
and
evil
their
false
evidence
will
finally
yield
to
truth
to
the
recognition
of
spirit
and
of
the
spiritual
creation
truth
can
not
be
contaminated
by
error
the
ment
that
is
necessarily
includes
the
correlated
statement
that
truth
unlikeness
is
the
great
conflict
the
suppositional
warfare
between
truth
and
error
is
only
the
mental
conflict
between
the
evidence
of
the
itual
senses
and
the
testimony
of
the
material
senses
and
this
warfare
between
the
spirit
and
flesh
will
settle
all
questions
through
faith
in
and
the
derstanding
of
divine
love
superstition
and
understanding
can
never
combine
when
the
final
physical
and
moral
effects
of
christian
science
are
fully
apprehended
the
conflict
between
truth
and
error
understanding
and
belief
science
and
material
sense
foreshadowed
by
the
prophets
and
inaugurated
by
jesus
will
cease
and
spiritual
harmony
reign
the
lightnings
and
thunderbolts
of
error
may
burst
and
flash
till
the
cloud
is
cleared
and
the
tumult
dies
away
in
the
distance
then
the
raindrops
of
divinity
refresh
the
earth
as
paul
says
there
remaineth
therefore
a
rest
to
the
people
of
god
of
spirit
the
chief
stones
in
the
temple
the
chief
stones
in
the
temple
of
christian
science
are
to
be
found
in
the
following
postulates
that
life
is
god
good
and
not
evil
that
soul
is
sinless
not
to
be
found
in
the
body
that
spirit
is
not
and
can
not
be
materialized
that
life
is
not
subject
to
death
that
the
spiritual
real
man
has
no
birth
no
terial
life
and
no
death
the
science
reveals
the
glorious
possibilities
of
immortal
man
forever
unlimited
by
the
mortal
senses
the
in
the
messiah
made
him
the
truth
and
life
the
eternal
truth
destroys
what
mortals
seem
to
have
learned
from
error
and
man
real
existence
as
a
child
of
god
comes
to
light
truth
demonstrated
is
eternal
life
mortal
man
can
never
rise
from
the
temporal
of
error
belief
in
sin
sickness
and
death
until
he
learns
that
god
is
the
only
life
the
belief
that
life
and
tion
are
in
the
body
should
be
overcome
by
the
standing
of
what
constitutes
man
as
the
image
of
god
then
spirit
will
have
overcome
the
flesh
wickedness
is
not
man
a
wicked
mortal
is
not
the
idea
of
god
he
is
little
else
than
the
expression
of
error
to
suppose
that
sin
lust
hatred
envy
hypocrisy
revenge
have
life
abiding
in
them
is
a
terrible
mistake
life
and
life
idea
truth
and
truth
idea
never
make
men
sick
sinful
or
mortal
death
but
an
illusion
the
fact
that
the
christ
or
truth
overcame
and
still
overcomes
death
proves
the
king
of
terrors
to
be
but
a
mortal
belief
or
error
which
truth
destroys
with
the
spiritual
evidences
of
life
and
this
shows
that
what
appears
to
the
senses
to
be
death
is
but
a
mortal
illusion
for
to
the
real
man
and
the
real
universe
there
is
no
the
belief
that
matter
has
life
results
by
the
universal
law
of
mortal
mind
in
a
belief
in
death
so
man
tree
and
flower
are
supposed
to
die
but
the
fact
remains
that
god
universe
is
spiritual
and
immortal
spiritual
offspring
the
spiritual
fact
and
the
material
belief
of
things
are
contradictions
but
the
spiritual
is
true
and
therefore
the
material
must
be
untrue
life
is
not
in
matter
therefore
it
can
not
be
said
to
pass
out
of
ter
matter
and
death
are
mortal
illusions
spirit
and
all
things
spiritual
are
the
real
and
eternal
man
is
not
the
offspring
of
flesh
but
of
spirit
of
life
not
of
matter
because
life
is
god
life
must
be
eternal
life
is
the
everlasting
i
am
the
ing
who
was
and
is
and
shall
be
whom
nothing
can
erase
death
no
advantage
if
the
principle
rule
and
demonstration
of
man
being
are
not
in
the
least
understood
before
what
is
termed
death
overtakes
mortals
they
will
rise
no
higher
itually
in
the
scale
of
existence
on
account
of
that
single
experience
but
will
remain
as
material
as
fore
the
transition
still
seeking
happiness
through
a
terial
instead
of
through
a
spiritual
sense
of
life
and
from
selfish
and
inferior
motives
that
life
or
mind
is
finite
and
physical
or
is
manifested
through
brain
and
nerves
is
false
hence
truth
comes
to
destroy
this
error
and
its
effects
sickness
sin
and
death
to
the
spiritual
class
relates
the
scripture
on
such
the
second
death
hath
no
power
future
purification
if
the
change
called
destroyed
the
belief
in
sin
sickness
and
death
happiness
would
be
won
at
the
ment
of
dissolution
and
be
forever
permanent
but
this
is
not
so
perfection
is
gained
only
by
perfection
they
who
are
unrighteous
shall
be
righteous
still
until
in
divine
science
christ
truth
moves
all
ignorance
and
sin
sin
is
punished
the
sin
and
error
which
possess
us
at
the
instant
of
death
do
not
cease
at
that
moment
but
endure
until
the
death
of
these
errors
to
be
wholly
spiritual
man
must
be
sinless
and
he
becomes
thus
only
when
he
reaches
perfection
the
murderer
though
slain
in
the
act
does
not
thereby
forsake
sin
he
is
no
more
spiritual
for
believing
that
his
body
died
and
learning
that
his
cruel
mind
died
not
his
thoughts
are
no
purer
until
evil
is
disarmed
by
good
his
body
is
as
material
as
his
mind
and
the
suppositions
that
sin
is
pardoned
while
saken
that
happiness
can
be
genuine
in
the
midst
of
sin
that
the
death
of
the
body
frees
from
sin
and
that
god
pardon
is
aught
but
the
destruction
of
sin
these
are
grave
mistakes
we
know
that
all
will
be
changed
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
when
the
last
trump
shall
sound
but
this
last
call
of
wisdom
can
not
come
till
mortals
have
already
yielded
to
each
lesser
call
in
the
growth
of
christian
character
mortals
need
not
fancy
that
belief
in
the
experience
of
death
will
awaken
them
to
glorified
being
salvation
and
probation
universal
salvation
rests
on
progression
and
probation
and
is
unattainable
without
them
heaven
is
not
a
ity
but
a
divine
state
of
mind
in
which
all
the
manifestations
of
mind
are
harmonious
and
immortal
because
sin
is
not
there
and
man
is
found
having
no
righteousness
of
his
own
but
in
sion
of
the
mind
of
the
lord
as
the
scripture
says
in
the
place
where
the
tree
falleth
there
it
shall
be
so
we
read
in
ecclesiastes
this
text
has
been
transformed
into
the
popular
proverb
as
the
tree
falls
so
it
must
lie
as
man
falleth
asleep
so
shall
he
awake
as
death
findeth
mortal
man
so
shall
he
be
after
death
until
probation
and
growth
shall
effect
the
needed
change
mind
never
becomes
dust
no
rection
from
the
grave
awaits
mind
or
life
for
the
grave
has
no
power
over
either
day
of
judgment
no
final
judgment
awaits
mortals
for
the
day
of
wisdom
comes
hourly
and
continually
even
the
judgment
by
which
mortal
man
is
vested
of
all
material
error
as
for
spiritual
error
there
is
none
when
the
last
mortal
fault
is
destroyed
then
the
final
trump
will
sound
which
will
end
the
battle
of
truth
with
error
and
mortality
but
of
that
day
and
hour
knoweth
no
man
here
prophecy
pauses
divine
science
alone
can
compass
the
heights
and
depths
of
being
and
reveal
the
infinite
primitive
error
truth
will
be
to
us
the
resurrection
and
the
life
only
as
it
destroys
all
error
and
the
belief
that
mind
the
only
immortality
of
man
can
be
fettered
by
the
body
and
life
be
controlled
by
death
a
ful
sick
and
dying
mortal
is
not
the
likeness
of
god
the
perfect
and
eternal
matter
is
the
primitive
belief
of
mortal
mind
because
this
mind
has
no
cognizance
of
spirit
to
mortal
mind
matter
is
substantial
and
evil
is
real
the
senses
of
mortals
are
material
hence
the
life
of
mortals
is
dependent
on
matter
explaining
the
origin
of
material
man
and
mortal
mind
jesus
said
why
do
ye
not
understand
my
speech
even
because
ye
can
not
hear
my
word
ye
are
of
your
father
the
devil
evil
and
the
lusts
of
your
father
ye
will
do
he
was
a
murderer
from
the
beginning
and
abode
not
in
the
truth
because
there
is
no
truth
in
him
when
he
speaketh
a
lie
he
speaketh
of
his
own
for
he
is
a
liar
and
the
father
of
it
immortal
man
this
carnal
material
mentality
misnamed
is
mortal
therefore
man
would
be
annihilated
were
it
not
for
the
spiritual
real
man
indissoluble
connection
with
his
god
which
jesus
brought
to
light
in
his
resurrection
and
ascension
jesus
showed
that
a
mortal
man
is
not
the
real
essence
of
manhood
and
that
this
unreal
material
mortality
disappears
in
presence
of
the
reality
elementary
electricity
electricity
is
not
a
vital
fluid
but
the
least
material
form
of
illusive
consciousness
the
material
ness
which
forms
no
link
between
matter
and
mind
and
which
destroys
itself
matter
and
mortal
mind
are
but
different
strata
of
human
belief
the
grosser
substratum
is
named
matter
or
body
the
more
ethereal
is
called
mind
this
mind
and
body
is
the
illusion
called
a
mortal
a
mind
in
matter
in
reality
and
in
science
both
strata
mortal
mind
and
mortal
body
are
false
representatives
of
man
the
material
gases
and
forces
are
feits
of
the
spiritual
forces
of
divine
mind
whose
potency
is
truth
whose
attraction
is
love
whose
adhesion
and
cohesion
are
life
perpetuating
the
eternal
facts
of
being
electricity
is
the
sharp
surplus
of
materiality
which
terfeits
the
true
essence
of
spirituality
or
truth
the
great
difference
being
that
electricity
is
not
intelligent
while
spiritual
truth
is
mind
the
counterfeit
forces
there
is
no
vapid
fury
of
mortal
mind
expressed
in
earthquake
wind
wave
lightning
fire
bestial
ferocity
and
this
mind
is
the
manifestations
of
evil
which
counterfeit
divine
justice
are
called
in
the
scriptures
the
anger
of
the
lord
in
reality
they
show
the
of
error
or
matter
and
point
to
matter
opposite
the
strength
and
permanency
of
spirit
christian
science
brings
to
light
truth
and
its
supremacy
universal
mony
the
entireness
of
god
good
and
the
nothingness
of
evil
instruments
of
error
the
five
physical
senses
are
the
avenues
and
ments
of
human
error
and
they
correspond
with
error
these
senses
indicate
the
common
human
belief
that
life
substance
and
intelligence
are
a
unison
of
matter
with
spirit
this
is
pantheism
and
carries
within
itself
the
seeds
of
all
error
if
man
is
both
mind
and
matter
the
loss
of
one
finger
would
take
away
some
quality
and
quantity
of
the
man
for
matter
and
man
would
be
one
mortal
verdict
the
belief
that
matter
thinks
sees
or
feels
is
not
more
real
than
the
belief
that
matter
enjoys
and
suffers
this
mortal
belief
misnamed
is
error
saying
matter
has
intelligence
and
sensation
nerves
feel
brain
thinks
and
sins
the
stomach
can
make
a
man
cross
injury
can
cripple
and
matter
can
kill
man
this
verdict
of
the
material
senses
victimizes
mortals
taught
as
they
are
by
physiology
and
pathology
to
revere
false
testimony
even
the
errors
that
are
destroyed
by
truth
through
spiritual
sense
and
science
mythical

the
lines
of
demarcation
between
immortal
man
senting

and
mortal
man
representing
the
error
that
life
and
intelligence
are
in

show
the
pleasures
and
pains
of
matter
to
be
myths
and
human
belief
in
them
to
be
the
father
of
mythology
in
which
matter
is
represented
as
divided
into
intelligent
gods
man
genuine
selfhood
is
recognizable
only
in
what
is
good
and
true
man
is
neither
nor
made
by
mortals
god
created
man
severed

the
inebriate
believes
that
there
is
pleasure
in
tion
the
thief
believes
that
he
gains
something
by
ing
and
the
hypocrite
that
he
is
hiding
himself
the
science
of
mind
corrects
such
mistakes
for
truth
strates
the
falsity
of
error
severed
members
the
belief
that
a
severed
limb
is
aching
in
the
old
tion
the
sensation
seeming
to
be
in
nerves
which
are
no
longer
there
is
an
added
proof
of
the
reliability
of
physical
testimony
mortals
unlike
immortals
god
creates
and
governs
the
universe
including
man
the
universe
is
filled
with
spiritual
ideas
which
he
evolves
and
they
are
obedient
to
the
mind
that
makes
them
mortal
mind
would
form
the
spiritual
into
the
material
and
then
recover
man
original
self
in
order
to
escape
from
the
mortality
of
this
error
mortals
are
not
like
immortals
created
in
god
own
image
but
infinite
spirit
being
all
mortal
consciousness
will
at
last
yield
to
the
scientific
fact
and
disappear
and
the
real
sense
of
being
perfect
and
forever
intact
will
appear
goodness
transparent
the
manifestation
of
god
through
mortals
is
as
light
passing
through
the
the
light
and
the
glass
never
mingle
but
as
matter
the
glass
is
less
opaque
than
the
walls
the
mortal
mind
through
which
truth
appears
most
vividly
is
that
one
which
has
lost
much
materiality
much
error
in
order
to
become
a
better
transparency
for
truth
then
like
a
cloud
melting
into
thin
vapor
it
no
longer
hides
the
sun
brainology
a
myth
all
that
is
called
mortal
thought
is
made
up
of
error
the
theoretical
mind
is
matter
named
or
the
exact
opposite
of
real
mind
or
spirit
brainology
teaches
that
mortals
are
created
to
suffer
and
die
it
further
teaches
that
when
man
is
dead
his
immortal
soul
is
resurrected
from
death
and
mortality
thus
error
orizes
that
spirit
is
born
of
matter
and
returns
to
ter
and
that
man
has
a
resurrection
from
dust
whereas
science
unfolds
the
eternal
verity
that
man
is
the
spiritual
eternal
reflection
of
god
scientific
purgation
progress
is
born
of
experience
it
is
the
ripening
of
mortal
man
through
which
the
mortal
is
dropped
for
the
immortal
either
here
or
hereafter
fering
or
science
must
destroy
all
illusions
regarding
life
and

and
regenerate
material
sense
and
self
the
old
man
with
his
deeds
must
be
put
off
nothing
sensual
or
sinful
is
immortal
the
death
of
a
false
material
sense
and
of
sin
not
the
death
of
organic
matter
is
what
reveals
man
and
life
harmonious
real
and
eternal
the
pleasures
and

of

perish
and
they
must
go
out
under
the
blaze
of

spiritual

and
the
actuality
of
being
mortal
belief
must
lose
all
satisfaction
in

in
order
to
part
with
them
whether
mortals
will
learn
this
sooner
or
later
and
how
long
they
will
suffer
the
pangs
of
destruction
pends
upon
the
tenacity
of
error
mixed
testimony
the
knowledge
obtained
from
the
corporeal
senses
leads
to
sin
and
death
when
the
evidence
of

truth
and
error
seems
to
mingle
it
rests
upon
foundations
which
time

wearing
away
mortal
mind
judges
by
the
testimony
of
the
material
senses
until
science
obliterates
this
false
testimony
an
improved
belief
is
one
step
out
of
error
and
aids
in
taking
the
next
step
and
in
understanding
the
situation
in
christian
science
belief
an
autocrat
mortal
belief
is
a
liar
from
the
beginning
not
deserving
power
it
says
to
mortals
you
are
wretched
and
they
think
they
are
so
and
nothing
can
change
this
state
until
the
belief
changes
mortal
belief
says
you
are
happy
and
mortals
are
so
and
no
circumstance
can
alter
the
situation
until
the
belief
on
this
ject
changes
human
belief
says
to
mortals
you
are
sick
and
this
testimony
manifests
itself
on
the
body
as
sickness
it
is
as
necessary
for
a
as
for
an
illusion
of
sickness
to
be
instructed
out
of

into
the
understanding
of
what

health

erroneous

change
the

and
that
disappears
which
before
seemed
real
to
this
false
belief
and
the
human
ness
rises
higher
thus
the
reality
of
being
is
attained
and
man
found
to
be
immortal
the
only
fact
concerning
any
material
concept
is
that
it
is
neither
scientific
nor
eternal
but
subject
to

solution
faith

faith

and
more
spiritual

it
is
a

to
appear

human
thoughts
have
their
degrees
of
comparison
some
thoughts
are
better

others
a
belief
in
truth
is
better
than
a
belief
in
error
but
no
mortal
testimony
is
founded
on
the

rock
mortal
testimony
can
be
shaken
until

human

human

these

unawares

gained

figuratively
represented

ought
we
not
then
to

corporeal

may
seem
to
hide

but
science
the
sunshine
of

will
melt
away

and
reveal

man
if
man
were
solely
a
creature
of
the
material

he
would
have
no
eternal
principle
and
would
be
mutable
and
mortal
human
logic
is
awry
when
it
attempts
to
draw
correct
spiritual
conclusions
regarding

from

finite

has
no
true

his

image
or
reflection
man
the
mirage
which
makes
trees
and
cities
seem
to
be
where
they
are
not
illustrates
the
illusion
of
material
man
who
can
not
be
the
image
of
god
so
far
as
the
scientific
statement
as
to
man
is
stood
it
can
be
proved
and
will
bring
to
light
the
true
reflection
of
god
the
real
man
or
the
man
as
paul
has
it
the
tares
and
wheat
the
temporal
and
unreal
never
touch
the
eternal
and
real
the
mutable
and
imperfect
never
touch
the
mutable
and
perfect
the
inharmonious
and
never
touch
the
harmonious
and
these
opposite
qualities
are
the
tares
and
wheat
which
never
really
mingle
though
to
mortal
sight
they
grow
side
by
side
until
the
harvest
then
ence
separates
the
wheat
from
the
tares
through
the
ization
of
god
as
ever
present
and
of
man
as
reflecting
the
divine
likeness
the
divine
reflection
spirit
is
god
soul
therefore
soul
is
not
in
matter
if
spirit
were
in
matter
god
would
have
no
representative
and
matter
would
be
identical
with
god
the
theory
that
soul
spirit
intelligence
habits
matter
is
taught
by
the
schools
this
theory
is
unscientific
the
universe
reflects
and
expresses
the
vine
substance
or
mind
therefore
god
is
seen
only
in
the
spiritual
universe
and
spiritual
man
as
the
sun
is
seen
in
the
ray
of
light
which
goes
out
from
it
god
is
vealed
only
in
that
which
reflects
life
truth
love
yea
which
manifests
god
attributes
and
power
even
as
the
human
likeness
thrown
upon
the
mirror
repeats
the
color
form
and
action
of
the
person
in
front
of
the
mirror
few
persons
comprehend
what
christian
science
means
by
the
word
himself
mortal
and
material
man
seems
to
be
substance
but
his
sense
of
substance
involves
error
and
therefore
is
material
temporal
on
the
other
hand
the
immortal
spiritual
man
is
really
substantial
and
reflects
the
eternal
substance
or
spirit
which
mortals
hope
for
he
reflects
the
divine
which
constitutes
the
only
real
and
eternal
entity
this
reflection
seems
to
mortal
sense
transcendental
because
the
spiritual
man
substantiality
transcends
mortal
vision
and
is
vealed
only
through
divine
science
inverted
images
and
ideas
as
god
is
substance
and
man
is
the
divine
image
and
likeness
man
should
wish
for
and
in
reality
has
only
the
substance
of
good
the
substance
of
spirit
not
matter
the
belief
that
man
has
any
other
substance
or
mind
is
not
spiritual
and
breaks
the
first
commandment
thou
shalt
have
one
god
one
mind
mortal
man
seems
to
himself
to
be
material
stance
while
man
is
image
idea
delusion
sin
ease
and
death
arise
from
the
false
testimony
of
material
sense
which
from
a
supposed
standpoint
outside
the
focal
distance
of
infinite
spirit
presents
an
inverted
image
of
mind
and
substance
with
everything
turned
upside
down
this
falsity
presupposes
soul
to
be
an
unsubstantial
dweller
in
material
forms
and
man
to
be
material
instead
of
spiritual
immortality
is
not
bounded
by
mortality
soul
is
not
compassed
by
finiteness
principle
is
not
to
be
found
in
fragmentary
ideas
identity
not
lost
the
material
body
and
mind
are
temporal
but
the
real
man
is
spiritual
and
eternal
the
identity
of
the
real
man
is
not
lost
but
found
through
this
explanation
for
the
conscious
infinitude
of
existence
and
of
all
identity
is
thereby
discerned
and
mains
unchanged
it
is
impossible
that
man
should
lose
aught
that
is
real
when
god
is
all

eternally

the
notion
that
mind
is
in
matter
and
that
the
ures
and
pains
the
birth
sin
sickness
and
death
of
matter
are
real
is
a
mortal
belief
and
this
belief
is
all
that
will
ever
be
lost
definition
of
man
continuing
our
definition
let
us
remember
that
harmonious
and
immortal
man
has
existed
forever
and
is
always
beyond
and
above
the
mortal
sion
of
any

on
fact
not
fable
the
science
of
being
reveals
man
as
perfect
even
as
the
father
is
perfect
because
the
soul
or
mind
of
the
spiritual
man
is
god
the
divine
principle
of
all
being
and
because
this
real
man
is
governed
by
soul
instead
of
sense
by
the
law
of
spirit
not
by
the
laws
of
matter
god
is
love
he
is
therefore
the
divine
infinite
ciple
called
person
or
god
man
true
consciousness
is
in
the
mental
not
in
any
bodily
or
personal
likeness
to
spirit
indeed
the
body
presents
no
proper
likeness
of
divinity
though
mortal
sense
would
fain
have
us
so
believe
mental
propagation
even
in
christian
science
reproduction
by
individual
ideas
is
but
the
reflection
of
the
creative
power
of
the
divine
principle
of
those
ideas
the
reflection
through
mental
manifestation
of
the
multitudinous
forms
of
mind
which
people
the
realm
of
the
real
is
controlled
by
mind
the
principle
governing
the
reflection
multiplication
of
god
dren
comes
from
no
power
of
propagation
in
matter
it
is
the
reflection
of
spirit
the
minutiae
of
lesser
individualities
reflect
the
one
vine
individuality
and
are
comprehended
in
and
formed
by
spirit
not
by
material
sensation
whatever
reflects
mind
life
truth
and
love
is
spiritually
conceived
and
brought
forth
but
the
statement
that
man
is
conceived
and
evolved
both
spiritually
and
materially
or
by
both
god
and
man
contradicts
this
eternal
truth
all
the
vanity
of
the
ages
can
never
make
both
these
contraries
true
divine
science
lays
the
axe
at
the
root
of
the
sion
that
life
or
mind
is
formed
by
or
is
in
the
material
body
and
science
will
eventually
destroy
this
illusion
through
the
of
all
error
and
the
beatified
understanding
of
the
science
of
life
error
defined
the
belief
that
pain
and
pleasure
life
and
death
ness
and
unholiness
mingle
in
man
that
mortal
material
man
is
the
likeness
of
god
and
is
himself
a
creator
is
a
fatal
error
man
entity
spiritual
god
without
the
image
and
likeness
of
himself
would
be
a
nonentity
or
mind
unexpressed
he
would
be
without
a
witness
or
proof
of
his
own
ture
spiritual
man
is
the
image
or
idea
of
god
an
idea
which
can
not
be
lost
nor
arated
from
its
divine
principle
when
the
evidence
before
the
material
senses
yielded
to
spiritual
sense
the
apostle
declared
that
nothing
could
alienate
him
from
god
from
the
sweet
sense
and
presence
of
life
and
truth
man
inseparable
from
love
it
is
ignorance
and
false
belief
based
on
a
material
sense
of
things
which
hide
spiritual
beauty
and
ness
understanding
this
paul
said
ther
death
nor
life
nor
things
present
nor
things
to
come
nor
height
nor
depth
nor
any
other
creature
shall
be
able
to
separate
us
from
the
love
of
god
this
is
the
doctrine
of
christian
science
that
divine
love
can
not
be
deprived
of
its
manifestation
or
object
that
joy
can
not
be
turned
into
sorrow
for
sorrow
is
not
the
master
of
joy
that
good
can
never
produce
evil
that
matter
can
never
produce
mind
nor
life
result
in
death
the
perfect
man
governed
by
god
his
perfect
principle
is
sinless
and
eternal
harmony
natural
harmony
is
produced
by
its
principle
is
controlled
by
it
and
abides
with
it
divine
principle
is
the
life
of
man
man
happiness
is
not
therefore
at
the
disposal
of
physical
sense
truth
is
not
contaminated
by
error
harmony
in
man
is
as
beautiful
as
in
music
and
discord
is
unnatural
unreal
the
science
of
music
governs
tones
if
mortals
caught
harmony
through
material
sense
they
would
lose
mony
if
time
or
accident
robbed
them
of
material
sense
to
be
master
of
chords
and
discords
the
science
of
music
must
be
understood
left
to
the
decisions
of
material
sense
music
is
liable
to
be
hended
and
lost
in
confusion
controlled
by
belief
instead
of
understanding
music
is
must
be
fectly
expressed
so
man
not
understanding
the
ence
of
being
thrusting
aside
his
divine
principle
as
incomprehensible
is
abandoned
to
conjectures
left
in
the
hands
of
ignorance
placed
at
the
disposal
of
illusions
subjected
to
material
sense
which
is
discord
a
tented
discordant
mortal
is
no
more
a
than
discord
is
music
human
reflection
a
picture
in
the
camera
or
a
face
reflected
in
the
mirror
is
not
the
original
though
resembling
it
man
in
the
likeness
of
his
maker
reflects
the
central
light
of
being
the
invisible
god
as
there
is
no
poreality
in
the
mirrored
form
which
is
but
a
reflection
so
man
like
all
things
real
reflects
god
his
divine
ciple
not
in
a
mortal
body
gender
also
is
a
quality
not
of
god
but
a
istic
of
mortal
mind
the
verity
that
god
image
is
not
a
creator
though
he
reflects
the
creation
of
mind
god
constitutes
the
underlying
reality
of
reflection
then
answered
jesus
and
said
unto
them
verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
the
son
can
do
nothing
of
himself
but
what
he
seeth
the
father
do
for
what
things
soever
he
doeth
these
also
doeth
the
son
likewise
inverted
images
the
inverted
images
presented
by
the
senses
the
flections
of
matter
as
opposed
to
the
science
of
ual
reflection
are
all
unlike
spirit
god
in
the
illusion
of
life
that
is
here
and
gone
man
would
be
wholly
mortal
were
it
not
that
love
the
divine
principle
that
obtains
in
divine
science
destroys
all
error
and
brings
tality
to
light
because
man
is
the
reflection
of
his
maker
he
is
not
subject
to
birth
growth
maturity
cay
these
mortal
dreams
are
of
human
origin
not
divine
jewish
traditions
the
sadducees
reasoned
falsely
about
the
tion
but
not
so
blindly
as
the
pharisees
who
believed
error
to
be
as
immortal
as
truth
the
pharisees
thought
that
they
could
raise
the
spiritual
from
the
material
they
would
first
make
life
result
in
death
and
then
resort
to
death
to
reproduce
spiritual
life
jesus
taught
them
how
death
was
to
be
overcome
by
spiritual
life
and
demonstrated
this
beyond
cavil
divinity
not
childless
life
demonstrates
life
the
immortality
of
soul
makes
man
immortal
if
god
who
is
life
were
parted
for
a
moment
from
his
reflection
man
during
that
moment
there
would
be
no
divinity
reflected
the
ego
would
be
unexpressed
and
the
father
would
be
childless
no
father
if
life
or
soul
and
its
representative
man
unite
for
a
period
and
then
are
separated
as
by
a
law
of
divorce
to
be
brought
together
again
at
some
uncertain
future
time
and
in
a
manner
unknown
and
this
is
the
general
religious
opinion
of
mankind
we
are
left
without
a
rational
proof
of
immortality
but
man
can
not
be
arated
for
an
instant
from
god
if
man
reflects
god
thus
science
proves
man
existence
to
be
intact
the
myriad
forms
of
mortal
thought
made
manifest
as
matter
are
not
more
distinct
nor
real
to
the
rial
senses
than
are
the
forms
to
spiritual
sense
which
cognizes
life
as
manent
undisturbed
amid
the
jarring
testimony
of
the
material
senses
science
still
enthroned
is
unfolding
to
mortals
the
immutable
harmonious
divine
principle
is
unfolding
life
and
the
universe
ever
present
and
eternal
god
man
spiritually
created
is
not
material
and
mortal
the
serpent
whisper
the
parent
of
all
human
discord
was
the
the
deep
sleep
in
which
originated
the
delusion
that
life
and
intelligence
proceeded
from
and
passed
into
matter
this
pantheistic
error
or
sists
still
upon
the
opposite
of
truth
saying
ye
shall
be
as
gods
that
is
i
will
make
error
as
real
and
eternal
as
truth
evil
still
affirms
itself
to
be
mind
and
declares
that
there
is
more
than
one
intelligence
or
god
it
says
there
shall
be
lords
and
gods
many
i
declare
that
god
makes
evil
minds
and
evil
spirits
and
that
i
aid
him
truth
shall
change
sides
and
be
unlike
spirit
i
will
put
spirit
into
what
i
call
matter
and
matter
shall
seem
to
have
life
as
much
as
god
spirit
who
the
only
life
bad
results
from
error
this
error
has
proved
itself
to
be
error
its
life
is
found
to
be
not
life
but
only
a
transient
false
sense
of
an
istence
which
ends
in
death
error
charges
its
lie
to
truth
and
says
the
lord
knows
it
he
has
made
man
immortal
and
material
out
of
ter
instead
of
spirit
thus
error
partakes
of
its
own
nature
and
utters
its
own
falsities
if
we
regard
matter
as
intelligent
and
mind
as
both
good
and
evil
every
sin
or
supposed
material
pain
and
pleasure
seems
normal
a
part
of
god
creation
and
so
weighs
against
our
course
spiritward
higher
statutes
truth
has
no
beginning
the
divine
mind
is
the
soul
of
man
and
gives
man
dominion
over
all
things
man
was
not
created
from
a
material
basis
nor
bidden
to
obey
material
laws
which
spirit
never
made
his
province
is
in
spiritual
statutes
in
the
higher
law
of
mind
the
great
question
above
error
awful
din
blackness
and
chaos
the
voice
of
truth
still
calls
adam
where
art
thou
ness
where
art
thou
art
thou
dwelling
in
the
belief
that
mind
is
in
matter
and
that
evil
is
mind
or
art
thou
in
the
living
faith
that
there
is
and
can
be
but
one
god
and
keeping
his
commandment
until
the
lesson
is
learned
that
god
is
the
only
mind
erning
man
mortal
belief
will
be
afraid
as
it
was
in
the
beginning
and
will
hide
from
the
demand
where
art
thou
this
awful
demand
adam
where
art
thou
is
met
by
the
admission
from
the
head
heart
stomach
blood
nerves
etc
lo
here
i
am
looking
for
happiness
and
life
in
the
body
but
finding
only
an
illusion
a
ing
of
false
claims
false
pleasure
pain
sin
sickness
and
death
the
patriarchs
heard
the
voice
of
truth
and
talked
with
god
as
consciously
as
man
talks
with
man
wrestling
of
jacob
jacob
was
wrestling
with
error
struggling
with
a
mortal
sense
of
life
substance
and
intelligence
as
existent
in
matter
with
its
false
pleasures
and
pains
when
an
angel
a
message
from
truth
and
love
appeared
to
him
and
smote
the
sinew
or
strength
of
his
error
till
he
saw
its
unreality
and
truth
being
thereby
understood
gave
him
spiritual
strength
in
this
peniel
of
divine
science
then
said
the
spiritual
evangel
let
me
go
for
the
day
breaketh
that
is
the
light
of
truth
and
love
dawns
upon
thee
but
the
patriarch
perceiving
his
error
and
his
need
of
help
did
not
loosen
his
hold
upon
this
glorious
light
until
his
nature
was
transformed
when
jacob
was
asked
what
is
thy
name
he
straightway
answered
and
then
his
name
was
changed
to
israel
for
as
a
prince
had
he
prevailed
and
had
power
with
god
and
with
men
then
jacob
questioned
his
deliverer
tell
me
i
pray
thee
name
but
this
appellation
was
withheld
for
the
messenger
was
not
a
corporeal
being
but
a
less
incorporeal
impartation
of
divine
love
to
man
which
to
use
the
word
of
the
psalmist
soul
gave
him
the
spiritual
sense
of
being
and
rebuked
his
material
sense
israel
the
new
name
the
result
of
jacob
struggle
thus
appeared
he
had
conquered
material
error
with
the
understanding
of
spirit
and
of
spiritual
power
this
changed
the
man
he
was
no
longer
called
jacob
but
israel
a
prince
of
god
or
a
soldier
of
god
who
had
fought
a
good
fight
he
was
to
become
the
father
of
those
who
through
earnest
striving
followed
his
demonstration
of
the
power
of
spirit
over
the
material
senses
and
the
children
of
earth
who
followed
his
example
were
to
be
called
the
children
of
israel
until
the
messiah
should
rename
them
if
these
children
should
go
astray
and
forget
that
life
is
god
good
and
that
good
is
not
in
elements
which
are
not
spiritual
thus
losing
the
divine
power
which
heals
the
sick
and
sinning
they
were
to
be
brought
back
through
great
tribulation
to
be
renamed
in
christian
science
and
led
to
deny
material
sense
or
mind
in
matter
even
as
the
gospel
teaches
life
never
structural
the
science
of
being
shows
it
to
be
impossible
for
finite
spirit
or
soul
to
be
in
a
finite
body
or
for
man
to
have
an
intelligence
separate
from
his
maker
it
is
a
error
to
suppose
that
there
can
be
such
a
reality
as
organic
animal
or
vegetable
life
when
such
life
always
ends
in
death
life
is
never
for
a
moment
extinct
therefore
it
is
never
tural
nor
organic
and
is
never
absorbed
nor
limited
by
its
own
formations
thought
seen
as
substance
the
artist
is
not
in
his
painting
the
picture
is
the
artist
thought
objectified
the
human
belief
fancies
that
it
delineates
thought
on
matter
but
what
is
matter
did
it
exist
prior
to
thought
matter
is
made
up
of
supposititious
mortal
but
all
might
is
divine
mind
thought
will
finally
be
understood
and
seen
in
all
form
substance
and
color
but
without
material
accompaniments
the
potter
is
not
in
the
clay
else
the
clay
would
have
power
over
the
potter
god
is
his
own
infinite
mind
and
expresses
all
the
central
intelligence
day
may
decline
and
shadows
fall
but
darkness
flees
when
the
earth
has
again
turned
upon
its
axis
the
sun
is
not
affected
by
the
revolution
of
the
earth
so
science
reveals
soul
as
god
untouched
by
sin
and
death
as
the
central
life
and
intelligence
around
which
circle
harmoniously
all
things
in

soul
imperishable
soul
changeth
not
we
are
commonly
taught
that
there
is
a
human
soul
which
sins
and
is
spiritually
lost
that
soul
may
be
lost
and
yet
be
immortal
if
soul
could
sin
spirit
soul
would
be
flesh
stead
of
spirit
it
is
the
belief
of
the
flesh
and
of
rial
sense
which
sins
if
soul
sinned
soul
would
die
sin
is
the
element
of
and
spiritual
death
is
oblivion
if
there
was
sin
in
soul
the
annihilation
of
spirit
would
be
inevitable
the
only
life
is
spirit
and
if
spirit
should
lose
life
as
god
good
then
spirit
which
has
no
other
existence
would
be
annihilated
mind
is
god
and
god
is
not
seen
by
material
sense
because
mind
is
spirit
which
material
sense
can
not
cern
there
is
neither
growth
maturity
nor
decay
in
soul
these
changes
are
the
mutations
of
material
sense
the
varying
clouds
of
mortal
belief
which
hide
the
truth
of
being
what
we
term
mortal
mind
or
carnal
mind
dependent
on
matter
for
manifestation
is
not
mind
god
is
mind
all
that
mind
god
is
or
hath
made
is
good
and
he
made
all
hence
evil
is
not
made
and
is
not
real
sin
only
of
the
flesh
soul
is
immortal
because
it
is
spirit
which
has
no

lost
spiritually
no
he
can
only
lose
a
sense
material
all
sin
is
of
the
flesh
it
can
not
be
spiritual
sin
exists
here
or
hereafter
only
so
long
as
the
illusion
of
mind
in
matter
remains
it
is
a
sense
of
sin
and
not
a
sinful
soul
which
is
lost
evil
is
destroyed
by
the
sense
of
good
soul
impeccable
through
false
estimates
of
soul
as
dwelling
in
sense
and
of
mind
as
dwelling
in
matter
belief
strays
into
a
sense
of
temporary
loss
or
absence
of
soul
itual
truth
this
state
of
error
is
the
mortal
dream
of
life
and
substance
as
existent
in
matter
and
is
directly
opposite
to
the
immortal
reality
of
being
so
long
as
we
believe
that
soul
can
sin
or
that
immortal
soul
is
in
mortal
body
we
can
never
understand
the
science
of
ing
when
humanity
does
understand
this
science
it
will
become
the
law
of
life
to
man
even
the
higher
law
of
soul
which
prevails
over
material
sense
through
mony
and
immortality
the
objects
cognized
by
the
physical
senses
have
not
the
reality
of
substance
they
are
only
what
mortal
belief
calls
them
matter
sin
and
mortality
lose
all
supposed
consciousness
or
claim
to
life
or
existence
as
mortals
lay
off
a
false
sense
of
life
substance
and
gence
but
the
spiritual
eternal
man
is
not
touched
by
these
phases
of
mortality
how
true
it
is
that
whatever
is
learned
through
material
sense
must
be
lost
because
such
knowledge
is
reversed
by
the
spiritual
facts
of
being
in
science
that
which
material
sense
calls
intangible
is
found
to
be
substance
what
to
material
sense
seems
substance
becomes
nothingness
as
the
dream
vanishes
and
reality
appears
the
senses
regard
a
corpse
not
as
man
but
simply
as
matter
people
say
man
is
dead
but
this
death
is
the
departure
of
a
mortal
mind
not
of
matter
the
matter
is
still
there
the
belief
of
that
mortal
that
he
must
die
occasioned
his
departure
yet
you
say
that
matter
has
caused
his
death
vain
ecstasies
people
go
into
ecstasies
over
the
sense
of
a
corporeal
jehovah
though
with
scarcely
a
spark
of
love
in
their
hearts
yet
god
love
and
without
love
god
immortality
can
not
appear
mortals
try
to
believe
without
understanding
truth
yet
god
truth
mortals
claim
that
death
is
inevitable
but
eternal
principle
is
life
mortals
believe
in
a
finite
personal
god
while
god
is
infinite
love
which
must
be
unlimited
theories
our
theories
are
based
on
finite
premises
which
not
penetrate
beyond
matter
a
personal
sense
of
god
and
of
man
capabilities
necessarily
limits
faith
and
hinders
spiritual
understanding
it
divides
faith
and
understanding
between
matter
and
spirit
the
finite
and
the
infinite
and
so
turns
away
from
the
intelligent
and
divine
healing
principle
to
the
inanimate
drug
the
one
anointed
jesus
spiritual
origin
and
his
demonstration
of
divine
principle
richly
endowed
him
and
entitled
him
to
sonship
in
science
he
was
the
son
of
a
virgin
the
term
christ
jesus
or
jesus
the
christ
to
give
the
full
and
proper
translation
of
the
greek
may
be
dered
jesus
the
anointed
jesus
the
crowned
or
the
divinely
royal
man
as
it
is
said
of
him
in
the
first
chapter
of
hebrews
therefore
god
even
thy
god
hath
anointed
thee
with
the
oil
of
gladness
above
thy
fellows
with
this
agrees
another
passage
in
the
same
chapter
which
refers
to
the
son
as
the
brightness
of
his
god
glory
and
the
express
expressed
image
of
his
person
infinite
mind
it
is
noteworthy
that
the
phrase
press
image
in
the
common
version
is
in
the
greek
testament
using
this
word
in
its
higher
ing
we
may
assume
that
the
author
of
this
remarkable
epistle
regarded
christ
as
the
son
of
god
the
royal
reflection
of
the
infinite
and
the
cause
given
for
the
altation
of
jesus
mary
son
was
that
he
loved
eousness
and
hated
iniquity
the
passage
is
made
even
clearer
in
the
translation
of
the
late
george
noyes
who
being
a
brightness
from
his
glory
and
an
image
of
his
being
jesus
the
scientist
jesus
of
nazareth
was
the
most
scientific
man
that
ever
trod
the
globe
he
plunged
beneath
the
material
surface
of
things
and
found
the
spiritual
cause
to
accommodate
himself
to
ture
ideas
of
spiritual
power
for
spirituality
was
pos
sessed
only
in
a
limited
degree
even
by
his
disciples
jesus
called
the
body
which
by
spiritual
power
he
raised
from
the
grave
flesh
and
bones
to
show
that
the
substance
of
himself
was
spirit
and
the
body
no
more
perfect
because
of
death
and
no
less
material
until
the
ascension
his
further
spiritual
exaltation
jesus
waited
until
the
mortal
or
fleshly
sense
had
linquished
the
belief
of
and
spiritual
sense
had
quenched
all
earthly
yearnings
thus
he
found
the
eternal
ego
and
proved
that
he
and
the
father
were
inseparable
as
god
and
his
reflection
or
spiritual
man
our
master
gained
the
solution
of
being
demonstrating
the
existence
of
but
one
mind
without
a
second
or
equal
the
bodily
resurrection
the
jews
who
sought
to
kill
this
man
of
god
showed
plainly
that
their
material
views
were
the
parents
of
their
wicked
deeds
when
jesus
spoke
of
ducing
his
body
knowing
as
he
did
that
mind
was
the
builder
and
said
destroy
this
temple
and
in
three
days
i
will
raise
it
up
they
thought
that
he
meant
their
material
temple
instead
of
his
body
to
such
materialists
the
real
man
seemed
a
spectre
unseen
and
unfamiliar
and
the
body
which
they
laid
in
a
sepulchre
seemed
to
be
substance
this
materialism
lost
sight
of
the
true
jesus
but
the
faithful
mary
saw
him
and
he
presented
to
her
more
than
ever
before
the
true
idea
of
life
and
substance
opposition
of
materialists
because
of
mortals
material
and
sinful
belief
the
spiritual
jesus
was
imperceptible
to
them
the
higher
his
demonstration
of
divine
science
carried
the
problem
of
being
and
the
more
tinctly
he
uttered
the
demands
of
its
divine
principle
truth
and
love
the
more
odious
he
became
to
sinners
and
to
those
who
depending
on
doctrines
and
material
laws
to
save
them
from
sin
and
sickness
were
sive
to
death
as
being
in
supposed
accord
with
the
inevitable
law
of
life
jesus
proved
them
wrong
by
his
resurrection
and
said
whosoever
liveth
and
lieveth
in
me
shall
never
die
hebrew
theology
that
saying
of
our
master
i
and
my
father
are
one
separated
him
from
the
scholastic
theology
of
the
rabbis
his
better
understanding
of
god
was
a
rebuke
to
them
he
knew
of
but
one
mind
and
laid
no
claim
to
any
other
he
knew
that
the
ego
was
mind
instead
of
body
and
that
matter
sin
and
evil
were
not
mind
and
his
understanding
of
this
divine
science
brought
upon
him
the
anathemas
of
the
age
the
true
sonship
the
opposite
and
false
views
of
the
people
hid
from
their
sense
christ
sonship
with
god
they
could
not
discern
his
spiritual
existence
their
carnal
minds
were
at
enmity
with
it
their
thoughts
were
filled
with
mortal
error
instead
of
with
god
ual
idea
as
presented
by
christ
jesus
the
likeness
of
god
we
lose
sight
of
through
sin
which
beclouds
the
itual
sense
of
truth
and
we
realize
this
likeness
only
when
we
subdue
sin
and
prove
man
heritage
the
liberty
of
the
sons
of
god
immaculate
conception
jesus
spiritual
origin
and
understanding
enabled
him
to
demonstrate
the
facts
of
being
to
prove
irrefutably
how
spiritual
truth
destroys
material
error
heals
sickness
and
overcomes
death
the
divine
conception
of
jesus
pointed
to
this
truth
and
sented
an
illustration
of
creation
the
history
of
jesus
shows
him
to
have
been
more
spiritual
than
all
other
earthly
personalities
jesus
as
mediator
wearing
in
part
a
human
form
that
is
as
it
seemed
to
mortal
view
being
conceived
by
a
human
mother
jesus
was
the
mediator
between
spirit
and
the
flesh
between
truth
and
error
explaining
and
ing
the
way
of
divine
science
he
became
the
way
of
salvation
to
all
who
accepted
his
word
from
him
tals
may
learn
how
to
escape
from
evil
the
real
man
being
linked
by
science
to
his
maker
mortals
need
only
turn
from
sin
and
lose
sight
of
mortal
selfhood
to
find
christ
the
real
man
and
his
relation
to
god
and
to
recognize
the
divine
sonship
christ
truth
was
demonstrated
through
jesus
to
prove
the
power
of
spirit
over
the
flesh
to
show
that
truth
is
made
manifest
by
its
effects
upon
the
human
mind
and
body
healing
sickness
and
destroying
sin
spiritual
government
jesus
represented
christ
the
true
idea
of
god
hence
the
warfare
between
this
spiritual
idea
and
perfunctory
religion
between
spiritual
and
the
blindness
of
popular
belief
which
led
to
the
conclusion
that
the
spiritual
idea
could
be
killed
by
crucifying
the
flesh
the
or
the
man
rose
higher
to
human
view
because
of
the
crucifixion
and
thus
proved
that
truth
was
the
master
of
death
christ
presents
the
indestructible
man
whom
spirit
ates
constitutes
and
governs
christ
illustrates
that
blending
with
god
his
divine
principle
which
gives
man
dominion
over
all
the
earth
deadness
in
sin
the
spiritual
idea
of
god
as
presented
by
jesus
was
scourged
in
person
and
its
principle
was
rejected
that
man
was
accounted
a
criminal
who
could
prove
god
divine
power
by
healing
the
sick
casting
out
evils
spiritualizing
materialistic
beliefs
and
raising
the
dead
those
dead
in
trespasses
and
sins
satisfied
with
the
flesh
resting
on
the
basis
of
ter
blind
to
the
possibilities
of
spirit
and
its
tive
truth
jesus
uttered
things
which
had
been
secret
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
since
material
knowledge
usurped
the
throne
of
the
creative
divine
principle
insisted
on
the
might
of
matter
the
force
of
falsity
the
cance
of
spirit
and
proclaimed
an
anthropomorphic
god
the
cup
of
jesus
whosoever
lives
most
the
life
of
jesus
in
this
age
and
declares
best
the
power
of
christian
science
will
drink
of
his
master
cup
resistance
to
truth
will
haunt
his
steps
and
he
will
cur
the
hatred
of
sinners
till
wisdom
is
justified
of
her
children
these
blessed
benedictions
rest
upon
jesus
followers
if
the
world
hate
you
ye
know
that
it
hated
me
before
it
hated
you
lo
i
am
with
you
alway
that
is
not
only
in
all
time
but
in
and
conditions
the
individuality
of
man
is
no
less
tangible
because
it
is
spiritual
and
because
his
life
is
not
at
the
mercy
of
matter
the
understanding
of
his
spiritual
individuality
makes
man
more
real
more
formidable
in
truth
and
ables
him
to
conquer
sin
disease
and
death
our
lord
and
master
presented
himself
to
his
disciples
after
his
resurrection
from
the
grave
as
the
jesus
whom
they
had
loved
before
the
tragedy
on
calvary
material
skepticism
to
the
materialistic
thomas
looking
for
the
ideal
saviour
in
matter
instead
of
in
spirit
and
to
the
mony
of
the
material
senses
and
the
body
more
than
to
soul
for
an
earnest
of
tality
to
him
jesus
furnished
the
proof
that
he
was
unchanged
by
the
crucifixion
to
this
dull
and
ing
disciple
jesus
remained
a
fleshly
reality
so
long
as
the
master
remained
an
inhabitant
of
the
earth
ing
but
a
display
of
matter
could
make
existence
real
to
thomas
for
him
to
believe
in
matter
was
no
task
but
for
him
to
conceive
of
the
substantiality
of
spirit
to
know
that
nothing
can
efface
mind
and
immortality
in
which
spirit
reigns
was
more
difficult
what
the
senses
originate
corporeal
senses
define
diseases
as
realities
but
the
scriptures
declare
that
god
made
all
even
while
the
poreal
senses
are
saying
that
matter
causes
disease
and
the
divine
mind
can
not
or
will
not
heal
it
the
material
senses
originate
and
support
all
that
is
material
untrue
selfish
or
debased
they
would
put
soul
into
soil
life
into
limbo
and
doom
all
things
to
decay
we
must
silence
this
lie
of
material
sense
with
the
truth
of
spiritual
sense
we
must
cause
the
error
to
cease
that
brought
the
belief
of
sin
and
death
and
would
efface
the
pure
sense
of
omnipotence
sickness
as
discord
is
the
sick
man
sinful
above
all
others
no
but
so
far
as
he
is
discordant
he
is
not
the
image
of
god
weary
of
their
material
beliefs
from
which
comes
so
much
suffering
invalids
grow
more
spiritual
as
the
error
or
belief
that
life
is
in
matter
yields
to
the
reality
of
spiritual
life
the
science
of
mind
denies
the
error
of
sensation
in
matter
and
heals
with
truth
medical
science
treats
disease
as
though
disease
were
real
therefore
right
and
attempts
to
heal
it
with
matter
if
disease
is
right
it
is
wrong
to
heal
it
material
methods
are
temporary
and
are
not
adapted
to
elevate
mankind
the
governor
is
not
subjected
to
the
governed
in
science
man
is
governed
by
god
divine
principle
as
numbers
are
controlled
and
proved
by
his
laws
gence
does
not
originate
in
numbers
but
is
manifested
through
them
the
body
does
not
include
soul
but
ifests
mortality
a
false
sense
of
soul
the
delusion
that
there
is
life
in
matter
has
no
kinship
with
the
life
supernal
unscientific
introspection
science
depicts
disease
as
error
as
matter
mind
and
error
reversed
as
subserving
the
facts
of
health
to
calculate
one
from
a
material
basis
would
infringe
upon
spiritual
law
and
misguide
human
hope
having
faith
in
the
divine
principle
of
health
and
spiritually
standing
god
sustains
man
under
all
circumstances
whereas
the
lower
appeal
to
the
general
faith
in
material
means
commonly
called
nature
must
yield
to
the
might
of
infinite
spirit
throughout
the
infinite
cycles
of
eternal
existence
spirit
and
matter
neither
concur
in
man
nor
in
the
universe
god
the
only
mind
the
varied
doctrines
and
theories
which
presuppose
life
and
intelligence
to
exist
in
matter
are
so
many
ancient
and
modern
mythologies
mystery
miracle
sin
and
death
will
disappear
when
it
becomes
fairly
understood
that
the
divine
mind
controls
man
and
man
has
no
mind
but
god
scriptures
misinterpreted
the
divine
science
taught
in
the
original
language
of
the
bible
came
through
inspiration
and
needs
ration
to
be
understood
hence
the
hension
of
the
spiritual
meaning
of
the
bible
and
the
misinterpretation
of
the
word
in
some
instances
by
uninspired
writers
who
only
wrote
down
what
an
inspired
teacher
had
said
a
misplaced
word
changes
the
sense
and
misstates
the
science
of
the
scriptures
as
for
instance
to
name
love
as
merely
an
attribute
of
god
but
we
can
by
special
and
proper
capitalization
speak
of
the
love
of
love
meaning
by
that
what
the
beloved
disciple
meant
in
one
of
his
epistles
when
he
said
god
is
love
likewise
we
can
speak
of
the
truth
of
truth
and
of
the
life
of
life
for
christ
plainly
declared
i
am
the
way
the
truth
and
the
life
interior
meaning
metaphors
abound
in
the
bible
and
names
are
often
expressive
of
spiritual
ideas
the
most
distinguished
theologians
in
europe
and
america
agree
that
the
scriptures
have
both
a
spiritual
and
eral
meaning
in
smith
bible
dictionary
it
is
said
the
spiritual
interpretation
of
scripture
must
rest
upon
both
the
literal
and
moral
and
in
the
learned
article
on
noah
in
the
same
work
the
familiar
text
genesis
vi
and
the
lord
said
my
spirit
shall
not
always
strive
with
man
for
that
he
also
is
flesh
is
quoted
as
follows
from
the
original
hebrew
and
jehovah
said
my
spirit
shall
not
forever
rule
or
be
humbled
in
men
seeing
that
they
are
or
in
their
error
they
are
but
flesh
here
the
original
text
declares
plainly
the
spiritual
fact
of
being
even
man
eternal
and
nious
existence
as
image
idea
instead
of
matter
ever
transcendental
such
a
thought
appears
and
avers
that
this
fact
is
not
forever
to
be
humbled
by
the
belief
that
man
is
flesh
and
matter
for
according
to
that
error
man
is
mortal
job
on
the
resurrection
the
one
important
interpretation
of
scripture
is
the
spiritual
for
example
the
text
in
my
flesh
shall
i
see
god
gives
a
profound
idea
of
the
vine
power
to
heal
the
ills
of
the
flesh
and
encourages
mortals
to
hope
in
him
who
healeth
all
our
diseases
whereas
this
passage
is
continually
quoted
as
if
job
intended
to
declare
that
even
if
disease
and
worms
destroyed
his
body
yet
in
the
latter
days
he
should
stand
in
celestial
perfection
before
elohim
still
clad
in
material
flesh
an
interpretation
which
is
just
the
posite
of
the
true
as
may
be
seen
by
studying
the
book
of
job
as
paul
says
in
his
first
epistle
to
the
thians
flesh
and
blood
can
not
inherit
the
kingdom
of
god
fear
of
the
serpent
overcome
the
hebrew
lawgiver
slow
of
speech
despaired
of
making
the
people
understand
what
should
be
revealed
to
him
when
led
by
wisdom
to
cast
down
his
rod
he
saw
it
become
a
serpent
moses
fled
fore
it
but
wisdom
bade
him
come
back
and
handle
the
serpent
and
then
moses
fear
departed
in
this
incident
was
seen
the
actuality
of
science
matter
was
shown
to
be
a
belief
only
the
serpent
evil
under
wisdom
bidding
was
destroyed
through
understanding
divine
science
and
this
proof
was
a
staff
upon
which
to
lean
the
illusion
of
moses
lost
its
power
to
alarm
him
when
he
discovered
that
what
he
apparently
saw
was
really
but
a
phase
of
mortal
belief
leprosy
healed
it
was
scientifically
demonstrated
that
leprosy
was
a
creation
of
mortal
mind
and
not
a
condition
of
matter
when
moses
first
put
his
hand
into
his
bosom
and
drew
it
forth
white
as
snow
with
the
dread
disease
and
presently
restored
his
hand
to
its
natural
dition
by
the
same
simple
process
god
had
lessened
moses
fear
by
this
proof
in
divine
science
and
the
ward
voice
became
to
him
the
voice
of
god
which
said
it
shall
come
to
pass
if
they
will
not
believe
thee
neither
hearken
to
the
voice
of
the
first
sign
that
they
will
believe
the
voice
of
the
latter
sign
and
so
it
was
in
the
coming
centuries
when
the
science
of
being
was
demonstrated
by
jesus
who
showed
his
students
the
power
of
mind
by
changing
water
into
wine
and
taught
them
how
to
handle
serpents
unharmed
to
heal
the
sick
and
cast
out
evils
in
proof
of
the
supremacy
of
mind
standpoints
changed
when
understanding
changes
the
standpoints
of
life
and
intelligence
from
a
material
to
a
spiritual
basis
we
shall
gain
the
reality
of
life
the
control
of
soul
over
sense
and
we
shall
perceive
christianity
or
truth
in
its
divine
principle
this
must
be
the
climax
before
harmonious
and
immortal
man
is
obtained
and
his
capabilities
revealed
it
is
highly
important
in
view
of
the
immense
work
to
be
accomplished
before
this
nition
of
divine
science
can
come
to
turn
our
thoughts
towards
divine
principle
that
finite
belief
may
be
pared
to
relinquish
its
error
saving
the
inebriate
man
wisdom
finds
no
satisfaction
in
sin
since
god
has
sentenced
sin
to
suffer
the
necromancy
of
day
foreshadowed
the
mesmerism
and
tism
of
the
drunkard
thinks
he
enjoys
drunkenness
and
you
can
not
make
the
inebriate
leave
his
besottedness
until
his
physical
sense
of
pleasure
yields
to
a
higher
sense
then
he
turns
from
his
cups
as
the
startled
dreamer
who
wakens
from
an
incubus
curred
through
the
pains
of
distorted
sense
a
man
who
likes
to
do
wrong
finding
pleasure
in
it
and
refraining
from
it
only
through
fear
of
consequences
is
neither
a
temperate
man
nor
a
reliable
religionist
uses
of
suffering
the
sharp
experiences
of
belief
in
the
supposititious
life
of
matter
as
well
as
our
disappointments
and
ceaseless
woes
turn
us
like
tired
children
to
the
arms
of
divine
love
then
we
begin
to
learn
life
in
divine
science
without
this
process
of
weaning
canst
thou
by
searching
find
out
god
it
is
easier
to
desire
truth
than
to
rid
one
self
of
error
mortals
may
seek
the
understanding
of
christian
science
but
they
will
not
be
able
to
glean
from
christian
science
the
facts
of
being
without
striving
for
them
this
strife
consists
in
the
endeavor
to
forsake
error
of
every
kind
and
to
sess
no
other
consciousness
but
good
a
bright
outlook
through
the
wholesome
chastisements
of
love
we
are
helped
onward
in
the
march
towards
righteousness
peace
and
purity
which
are
the
landmarks
of
science
beholding
the
infinite
tasks
of
truth
we
pause
wait
on
god
then
we
push
onward
until
boundless
thought
walks
enraptured
and
tion
unconfined
is
winged
to
reach
the
divine
glory
need
and
supply
in
order
to
apprehend
more
we
must
put
into
tice
what
we
already
know
we
must
recollect
that
truth
is
demonstrable
when
understood
and
that
good
is
not
understood
until
demonstrated
if
faithful
over
a
few
things
we
shall
be
made
rulers
over
many
but
the
one
unused
talent
decays
and
is
lost
when
the
sick
or
the
sinning
awake
to
realize
their
need
of
what
they
have
not
they
will
be
receptive
of
divine
science
which
gravitates
towards
soul
and
away
from
material
sense
removes
thought
from
the
body
and
vates
even
mortal
mind
to
the
contemplation
of
thing
better
than
disease
or
sin
the
true
idea
of
god
gives
the
true
understanding
of
life
and
love
robs
the
grave
of
victory
takes
away
all
sin
and
the
delusion
that
there
are
other
minds
and
destroys
mortality
childlike
receptivity
the
effects
of
christian
science
are
not
so
much
seen
as
felt
it
is
the
still
small
voice
of
truth
uttering
itself
we
are
either
turning
away
from
this
utterance
or
we
are
listening
to
it
and
going
up
higher
willingness
to
become
as
a
little
child
and
to
leave
the
old
for
the
new
renders
thought
receptive
of
the
advanced
idea
gladness
to
leave
the
false
landmarks
and
joy
to
see
them
disappear
this
disposition
helps
to
precipitate
the
ultimate
harmony
the
purification
of
sense
and
self
is
a
proof
of
progress
blessed
are
the
pure
in
heart
for
they
shall
see
god
narrow
pathway
unless
the
harmony
and
immortality
of
man
are
coming
more
apparent
we
are
not
gaining
the
true
idea
of
god
and
the
body
will
reflect
what
erns
it
whether
it
be
truth
or
error
understanding
or
belief
spirit
or
matter
therefore
acquaint
now
thyself
with
him
and
be
at
peace
be
watchful
sober
and
vigilant
the
way
is
straight
and
narrow
which
leads
to
the
understanding
that
god
is
the
only
life
it
is
a
warfare
with
the
flesh
in
which
we
must
conquer
sin
sickness
and
death
either
here
or
hereafter
certainly
before
we
can
reach
the
goal
of
spirit
or
life
in
god
paul
enlightenment
paul
was
not
at
first
a
disciple
of
jesus
but
a
cutor
of
jesus
followers
when
the
truth
first
appeared
to
him
in
science
paul
was
made
blind
and
his
blindness
was
felt
but
spiritual
light
soon
enabled
him
to
follow
the
example
and
ings
of
jesus
healing
the
sick
and
preaching
ity
throughout
asia
minor
greece
and
even
in
imperial
rome
paul
writes
if
christ
truth
be
not
risen
then
is
our
preaching
vain
that
is
if
the
idea
of
the
acy
of
spirit
which
is
the
true
conception
of
being
come
not
to
your
thought
you
can
not
be
benefited
by
what
i
say
abiding
in
life
jesus
said
substantially
he
that
believeth
in
me
shall
not
see
death
that
is
he
who
perceives
the
true
idea
of
life
loses
his
belief
in
death
he
who
has
the
true
idea
of
good
loses
all
sense
of
evil
and
by
reason
of
this
is
being
ushered
into
the
undying
realities
of
spirit
such
a
one
abideth
in
life
life
obtained
not
of
the
body
incapable
of
supporting
life
but
of
truth
unfolding
its
own
immortal
idea
jesus
gave
the
true
idea
of
being
which
results
in
infinite
ings
to
mortals

paul
writes
when
christ
who
is
our
life
shall
appear
be
manifested
then
shall
ye
also
appear
be
manifested
with
him
in
glory
when
spiritual
being
is
understood
in
all
its
perfection
continuity
and
might
then
shall
man
be
found
in
god
image
the
absolute
meaning
of
the
apostolic
words
is
this
then
shall
man
be
found
in
his
likeness
perfect
as
the
father
indestructible
in
life
hid
with
christ
in
god
with
truth
in
divine
love
where
human
sense
hath
not
seen
man
consecration
required
paul
had
a
clear
sense
of
the
demands
of
truth
upon
mortals
physically
and
spiritually
when
he
said
sent
your
bodies
a
living
sacrifice
holy
ceptable
unto
god
which
is
your
reasonable
service
but
he
who
is
begotten
of
the
beliefs
of
the
flesh
and
serves
them
can
never
reach
in
this
world
the
divine
heights
of
our
lord
the
time
cometh
when
the
spiritual
origin
of
man
the
divine
science
which
ushered
jesus
into
human
presence
will
be
understood
and
demonstrated
when
first
spoken
in
any
age
truth
like
the
light
shineth
in
darkness
and
the
darkness
comprehended
it
not
a
false
sense
of
life
substance
and
mind
hides
the
divine
possibilities
and
conceals
scientific
demonstration
loving
god
supremely
if
we
wish
to
follow
christ
truth
it
must
be
in
the
way
of
god
appointing
jesus
said
he
that
believeth
on
me
the
works
that
i
do
shall
he
do
also
he
who
would
reach
the
source
and
find
the
divine
remedy
for
every
ill
must
not
try
to
climb
the
hill
of
science
by
some
other
road
all
nature
teaches
love
to
man
but
man
can
not
love
god
supremely
and
set
his
whole
affections
on
spiritual
things
while
loving
the
material
or
trusting
in
it
more
than
in
the
spiritual
we
must
forsake
the
foundation
of
material
systems
however
if
we
would
gain
the
christ
as
our
only
saviour
not
partially
but
fully
the
great
healer
of
mortal
mind
is
the
healer
of
the
body
the
purpose
and
motive
to
live
aright
can
be
gained
now
this
point
won
you
have
started
as
you
should
you
have
begun
at
the
of
christian
science
and
nothing
but
wrong
intention
can
hinder
your
advancement
working
and
praying
with
true
motives
your
father
will
open
the
way
who
did
hinder
you
that
ye
should
not
obey
the
truth
conversion
of
saul
saul
of
tarsus
beheld
the
way
the
christ
or
truth
only
when
his
uncertain
sense
of
right
yielded
to
a
spiritual
sense
which
is
always
right
then
the
man
was
changed
thought
assumed
a
nobler
outlook
and
his
life
became
more
spiritual
he
learned
the
wrong
that
he
had
done
in
persecuting
tians
whose
religion
he
had
not
understood
and
in
mility
he
took
the
new
name
of
paul
he
beheld
for
the
first
time
the
true
idea
of
love
and
learned
a
lesson
in
divine
science
reform
comes
by
understanding
that
there
is
no
ing
pleasure
in
evil
and
also
by
gaining
an
affection
for
good
according
to
science
which
reveals
the
immortal
fact
that
neither
pleasure
nor
pain
appetite
nor
passion
can
exist
in
or
of
matter
while
divine
mind
can
and
does
destroy
the
false
beliefs
of
pleasure
pain
or
fear
and
all
the
sinful
appetites
of
the
human
mind
image
of
the
beast
what
a
pitiful
sight
is
malice
finding
pleasure
in
venge
evil
is
sometimes
a
man
highest
conception
of
right
until
his
grasp
on
good
grows
stronger
then
he
loses
pleasure
in
wickedness
and
it
becomes
his
torment
the
way
to
escape
the
misery
of
sin
is
to
cease
sinning
there
is
no
other
way
sin
is
the
image
of
the
beast
to
be
effaced
by
the
sweat
of
agony
it
is
a
moral
madness
which
rushes
forth
to
clamor
with
midnight
and
tempest
peremptory
demands
to
the
physical
senses
the
strict
demands
of
christian
science
seem
peremptory
but
mortals
are
tening
to
learn
that
life
is
god
good
and
that
evil
has
in
reality
neither
place
nor
power
in
the
human
or
the
divine
economy
moral
courage
fear
of
punishment
never
made
man
truly
honest
moral
courage
is
requisite
to
meet
the
wrong
and
to
proclaim
the
right
but
how
shall
we
form
the
man
who
has
more
animal
than
moral
courage
and
who
has
not
the
true
idea
of
good
through
human
consciousness
convince
the
mortal
of
his
mistake
in
seeking
material
means
for
gaining
piness
reason
is
the
most
active
human
faculty
let
that
inform
the
sentiments
and
awaken
the
man
mant
sense
of
moral
obligation
and
by
degrees
he
will
learn
the
nothingness
of
the
pleasures
of
human
sense
and
the
grandeur
and
bliss
of
a
spiritual
sense
which
silences
the
material
or
corporeal
then
he
not
only
will
be
saved
but
saved
final
destruction
of
error
mortals
suppose
that
they
can
live
without
goodness
when
god
is
good
and
the
only
real
life
what
is
the
result
understanding
little
about
the
divine
principle
which
saves
and
heals
mortals
get
rid
of
sin
sickness
and
death
only
in
belief
these
errors
are
not
thus
really
destroyed
and
must
therefore
cling
to
mortals
until
here
or
hereafter
they
gain
the
true
derstanding
of
god
in
the
science
which
destroys
human
delusions
about
him
and
reveals
the
grand
realities
of
his
allness
promise
perpetual
this
understanding
of
man
power
when
he
is
equipped
by
god
has
sadly
disappeared
from
christian
history
for
centuries
it
has
been
dormant
a
lost
element
of
christianity
our
missionaries
carry
the
bible
to
india
but
can
it
be
said
that
they
explain
it
practically
as
jesus
did
when
hundreds
of
persons
die
there
annually
from
standing
spiritual
law
and
knowing
that
there
is
no
rial
law
jesus
said
these
signs
shall
follow
them
that
believe
they
shall
take
up
serpents
and
if
they
drink
any
deadly
thing
it
shall
not
hurt
them
they
shall
lay
hands
on
the
sick
and
they
shall
recover
it
were
well
had
christendom
believed
and
obeyed
this
sacred
saying
jesus
promise
is
perpetual
had
it
been
given
only
to
his
immediate
disciples
the
scriptural
passage
would
read
you
not
the
purpose
of
his
great
extends
through
time
and
includes
universal
humanity
its
principle
is
infinite
reaching
beyond
the
pale
of
a
single
period
or
of
a
limited
following
as
time
moves
on
the
healing
elements
of
pure
christianity
will
be
fairly
dealt
with
they
will
be
sought
and
taught
and
will
glow
in
all
the
grandeur
of
universal
goodness
imitation
of
jesus
a
little
leaven
leavens
the
whole
lump
a
little
standing
of
christian
science
proves
the
truth
of
all
that
i
say
of
it
because
you
can
not
walk
on
the
water
and
raise
the
dead
you
have
no
right
to
question
the
great
might
of
divine
science
in
these
tions
be
thankful
that
jesus
who
was
the
true
strator
of
science
did
these
things
and
left
his
example
for
us
in
science
we
can
use
only
what
we
understand
we
must
prove
our
faith
by
demonstration
one
should
not
tarry
in
the
storm
if
the
body
is
ing
nor
should
he
remain
in
the
devouring
flames
til
one
is
able
to
prevent
bad
results
he
should
avoid
their
occasion
to
be
discouraged
is
to
resemble
a
pupil
in
addition
who
attempts
to
solve
a
problem
of
euclid
and
denies
the
rule
of
the
problem
because
he
fails
in
his
first
effort
error
destroyed
not
pardoned
there
is
no
hypocrisy
in
science
principle
is
tive
you
can
not
mock
it
by
human
will
science
is
a
divine
demand
not
a
human
always
right
its
divine
principle
never
repents
but
tains
the
claim
of
truth
by
quenching
error
the
pardon
of
divine
mercy
is
the
destruction
of
error
if
men
understood
their
real
spiritual
source
to
be
all
edness
they
would
struggle
for
recourse
to
the
spiritual
and
be
at
peace
but
the
deeper
the
error
into
which
tal
mind
is
plunged
the
more
intense
the
opposition
to
spirituality
till
error
yields
to
truth
the
hopeful
outlook
human
resistance
to
divine
science
weakens
in
portion
as
mortals
give
up
error
for
truth
and
the
derstanding
of
being
supersedes
mere
belief
until
the
author
of
this
book
learned
the
vastness
of
christian
science
the
fixedness
of
mortal
sions
and
the
human
hatred
of
truth
she
cherished
sanguine
hopes
that
christian
science
would
meet
with
immiediate
and
universal
acceptance
when
the
following
platform
is
understood
and
the
letter
and
the
spirit
bear
witness
the
infallibility
of
divine
metaphysics
will
be
demonstrated
the
deific
supremacy
i
god
is
infinite
the
only
life
substance
spirit
or
soul
the
only
intelligence
of
the
universe
including
man
eye
hath
neither
seen
god
nor
his
image
and
likeness
neither
god
nor
the
perfect
man
can
be
discerned
by
the
material
senses
the
uality
of
spirit
or
the
infinite
is
unknown
and
thus
a
knowledge
of
it
is
left
either
to
human
conjecture
or
to
the
revelation
of
divine
science
the
deific
definitions
ii
god
is
what
the
scriptures
declare
him
to
be
life
truth
love
spirit
is
divine
principle
and
divine
principle
is
love
and
love
is
mind
and
mind
is
not
both
good
and
bad
for
god
is
mind
therefore
there
is
in
reality
one
mind
only
cause
there
is
one
god
evil
obsolete
iii
the
notion
that
both
evil
and
good
are
real
is
a
delusion
of
material
sense
which
science
annihilates
evil
is
nothing
no
thing
mind
nor
power

dementia

devil
hell
with
all
the
etceteras
that

includes
life
the

iv
god
is
divine
life
and
life
is
no
more
confined
to
the
forms
which
reflect
it
than
substance
is
in
its
shadow
if
life
were
in
mortal
man
or
rial
things
it
would
be
subject
to
their
tations
and
would
end
in
death
life
is
mind
the
creator
reflected
in
his
creations
if
he
dwelt
within
what
he
creates
god
would
not
be
reflected
but
absorbed
and
the
science
of
being
would
be
forever
lost
through
a
mortal
sense
which
falsely
testifies
to
a
beginning
and
an
end
allness
of
spirit
the
scriptures
imply
that
god
is
from
this
it
follows
that
nothing
possesses
reality
nor
existence
except
the
divine
mind
and
his
ideas
the
scriptures
also
declare
that
god
is
spirit
therefore
in
spirit
all
is
harmony
and
there
can
be
no
discord
all
is
life
and
there
is
no
death
everything
in
god
universe
expresses
him
the
universal
cause
vi
god
is
individual
incorporeal
he
is
divine
ciple
love
the
universal
cause
the
only
creator
and
there
is
no
other
he
is
inclusive
and
is
reflected
by
all
that
is
real
and
eternal
and
by
nothing
else
he
fills
all
space
and
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
of
such
omnipresence
and
dividuality
except
as
infinite
spirit
or
mind
hence
all
is
spirit
and
spiritual
divine
trinity
vii
life
truth
and
love
constitute
the
triune
person
called
god
that
is
the
triply
divine
principle
love
they
represent
a
trinity
in
unity
three
in
one
the
same
in
essence
though
form
in
office
god
the
christ
the
ual
idea
of
sonship
divine
science
or
the
holy
comforter
these
three
express
in
divine
science
the
threefold
tial
nature
of
the
infinite
they
also
indicate
the
divine
principle
of
scientific
being
the
intelligent
relation
of
god
to
man
and
the
universe
viii
is
the
name
for
deity
which
dicates
his
tender
relationship
to
his
spiritual
creation
as
the
apostle
expressed
it
in
words
which
he
quoted
with
approbation
from
a
classic
poet
for
we
are
also
his
offspring
the
son
of
god
ix
jesus
was
born
of
mary
christ
is
the
true
idea
voicing
good
the
divine
message
from
god
to
men
ing
to
the
human
consciousness
the
christ
is
incorporeal
spiritual
yea
the
divine
image
and
likeness
dispelling
the
illusions
of
the
senses
the
way
the
truth
and
the
life
healing
the
sick
and
casting
out
evils
destroying
sin
disease
and
death
as
paul
says
there
is
one
god
and
one
mediator
between
god
and
men
the
man
christ
jesus
the
corporeal
man
jesus
was
human
holy
ghost
or
comforter
jesus
demonstrated
christ
he
proved
that
christ
is
the
divine
idea
of
god
the
holy
ghost
or
comforter
revealing
the
divine
principle
love
and
leading
into
all
truth
christ
jesus
xi
jesus
was
the
son
of
a
virgin
he
was
appointed
to
speak
god
word
and
to
appear
to
mortals
in
such
a
form
of
humanity
as
they
could
understand
as
well
as
perceive
mary
conception
of
him
was
spiritual
for
only
purity
could
reflect
truth
and
love
which
were
plainly
incarnate
in
the
good
and
pure
christ
jesus
he
expressed
the
highest
type
of
divinity
which
a
fleshly
form
could
express
in
that
age
into
the
real
and
ideal
man
the
fleshly
element
can
not
enter
thus
it
is
that
christ
illustrates
the
coincidence
or
spiritual
agreement
between
god
and
man
in
his
image
messiah
or
christ
xii
the
word
is
not
properly
a
synonym
for
jesus
though
it
is
commonly
so
used
jesus
was
a
human
name
which
belonged
to
him
in
common
with
other
hebrew
boys
and
men
for
it
is
identical
with
the
name
joshua
the
renowned
hebrew
leader
on
the
other
hand
christ
is
not
a
name
so
much
as
the
divine
title
of
jesus
christ
expresses
god
spiritual
eternal
nature
the
name
is
synonymous
with
messiah
and
ludes
to
the
spirituality
which
is
taught
illustrated
and
demonstrated
in
the
life
of
which
christ
jesus
was
the
embodiment
the
proper
name
of
our
master
in
the
greek
was
jesus
the
christ
but
christ
jesus
better
nifies
the
godlike
the
divine
principle
and
idea
xiii
the
advent
of
jesus
of
nazareth
marked
the
first
century
of
the
christian
era
but
the
christ
is
without
beginning
of
years
or
end
of
days
throughout
all
generations
both
before
and
after
the
christian
era
the
christ
as
the
ual
idea
the
reflection
of
god
has
come
with
some
measure
of
power
and
grace
to
all
prepared
to
receive
christ
truth
abraham
jacob
moses
and
the
prophets
caught
glorious
glimpses
of
the
messiah
or
christ
which
baptized
these
seers
in
the
divine
nature
the
essence
of
love
the
divine
image
idea
or
christ
was
is
and
ever
will
be
inseparable
from
the
divine
principle
god
jesus
referred
to
this
unity
of
his
spiritual
identity
thus
before
abraham
was
i
am
i
and
my
father
are
one
my
father
is
greater
than
i
the
one
spirit
includes
all
identities
spiritual
oneness
xiv
by
these
sayings
jesus
meant
not
that
the
man
jesus
was
or
is
eternal
but
that
the
divine
idea
or
christ
was
and
is
so
and
therefore
antedated
abraham
not
that
the
corporeal
jesus
was
one
with
the
father
but
that
the
spiritual
idea
christ
dwells
forever
in
the
bosom
of
the
father
god
from
which
it
illumines
heaven
and
earth
not
that
the
father
is
greater
than
spirit
which
is
god
but
greater
infinitely
greater
than
the
fleshly
jesus
whose
earthly
career
was
brief
the
son
duality
xv
the
invisible
christ
was
imperceptible
to
the
personal
senses
whereas
jesus
appeared
as
a
bodily
existence
this
dual
personality
of
the
unseen
and
the
seen
the
spiritual
and
rial
the
eternal
christ
and
the
corporeal
jesus
manifest
in
flesh
continued
until
the
master
ascension
when
the
human
material
concept
or
jesus
disappeared
while
the
spiritual
self
or
christ
continues
to
exist
in
the
eternal
order
of
divine
science
taking
away
the
sins
of
the
world
as
the
christ
has
always
done
even
before
the
human
jesus
was
incarnate
to
mortal
eyes
eternity
of
the
christ
xvi
this
was
the
lamb
slain
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
slain
that
is
according
to
the
mony
of
the
corporeal
senses
but
undying
in
the
deific
mind
the
revelator
represents
the
son
of
man
as
saying
revelation
i
i
am
the
first
and
the
last
i
am
he
that
liveth
and
was
dead
not
understood
and
behold
i
am
alive
for
evermore
science
has
explained
me
this
is
a
mystical
ment
of
the
eternity
of
the
christ
and
is
also
a
reference
to
the
human
sense
of
jesus
crucified
infinite
spirit
xvii
spirit
being
god
there
is
but
one
spirit
for
there
can
be
but
one
infinite
and
therefore
one
god
there
are
neither
spirits
many
nor
gods
many
there
is
no
evil
in
spirit
because
god
is
spirit
the
theory
that
spirit
is
distinct
from
matter
but
must
pass
through
it
or
into
it
to
be
individualized
would
reduce
god
to
dependency
on
matter
and
establish
a
basis
for
pantheism
the
only

xviii
spirit
god

there

it

suggests
the

here

and
from
this

it

that

the

divine

pardon
destroying

prophesy

evil
not

xxxi
since
god
is
all
there
is
no
room
for
his
unlikeness
god
spirit
alone
created
all
and
called
it
good
therefore
evil
being
contrary
to
good
is
unreal
and
can
not
be
the
product
of
god
a
sinner
can
receive
no
encouragement
from
the
fact
that
science
demonstrates
the
unreality
of
evil
for
the
sinner
would
make
a
reality
of
sin
would
make
that
real
which
is
unreal
and
thus
heap
up
wrath
against

joining

against

by

deceived
only
those
who
repent

forsake

can
fully
understand

unreality

basis
of
health

immortality
xxxii
as
the
mythology
of
pagan
rome
has
yielded
to
a
more
spiritual
idea
of
deity
so
will
our
material
theories
yield
to
spiritual
ideas
until
the
finite
gives
place
to
the
infinite
sickness
to
health
sin
to
holiness
and
god
kingdom
comes
in
earth
as
it
is
in
heaven
the
basis
of
all
health
lessness
and
immortality
is
the
great
fact
that
god
is
the
only
mind
and
this
mind
must
be
not
merely
lieved
but
it
must
be
understood
to
get
rid
of
sin
through
science
is
to
divest
sin
of
any
supposed
mind
or
reality
and
never
to
admit
that
sin
can
have
gence
or
power
pain
or
pleasure
you
conquer
error
by
denying
its
verity
our
various
theories
will
never
lose
their
imaginary
power
for
good
or
evil
until
we
lose
our
faith
in
them
and
make
life
its
own
proof
of
harmony
and
god
this
text
in
the
book
of
ecclesiastes
conveys
the
christian
science
thought
especially
when
the
word
which
is
not
in
the
original
is
omitted
let
us
hear
the
conclusion
of
the
whole
matter
fear
god
and
keep
his
commandments
for
this
is
the
whole
duty
of
man
in
other
words
let
us
hear
the
clusion
of
the
whole
matter
love
god
and
keep
his
commandments
for
this
is
the
whole
of
man
in
his
image
and
likeness
divine
love
is
infinite
therefore
all
that
really
exists

the
first
commandment
is
my
favorite
text
it
demonstrates
christian
science
it
inculcates
the
unity
of
god
spirit

it
signifies
that
man
shall
have
no
other
spirit
or
mind
but
god
eternal
good
and
that
all
men
shall
have
one
mind
the
divine
principle
of
the
first
commandment
bases
the
science
of
being
by
which
man
demonstrates

objections
answered

because
i
tell
you
the
truth
ye
believe
me
not
which
of
you
convinceth
me
of

if
i
say
the

why
do
ye
not

but
if
the
spirit
of
him
that
raised
up
jesus
from

dwell
in

he
that
raised
up
christ
from

shall
also
quicken
your

paul
the
strictures
on
this
volume
would
condemn
to
oblivion
the
truth
which
is
raising
up
thousands
from
helplessness
to
strength
and
elevating
them
from
a
theoretical
to
a
practical
christianity
these
criticisms
are
generally
based
on
detached
sentences
or
clauses
arated
from
their
context
even
the
scriptures
which
grow
in
beauty
and
consistency
from
one
grand
root
pear
contradictory
when
subjected
to
such
usage
jesus
said
blessed
are
the
pure
in
heart
for
they
shall
see
god
truth
supported
by
facts
in
christian
science
mere
opinion
is
valueless
proof
is
essential
to
a
due
estimate
of
this
subject
sneers
at
the
application
of
the
science
tianity
can
not
prevent
that
from
being
tific
which
is
based
on
divine
principle
demonstrated
cording
to
a
divine
given
rule
and
subjected
to
proof
the
facts
are
so
absolute
and
numerous
in
support
of
christian
science
that
misrepresentation
and
tion
can
not
overthrow
it
paul
alludes
to
doubtful
putations
the
hour
has
struck
when
proof
and
stration
instead
of
opinion
and
dogma
are
summoned
to
the
support
of
christianity
making
wise
the
simple
commands
of
jesus
in
the
result
of
some
unqualified
condemnations
of
scientific
one
may
see
with
sorrow
the
sad
effects
on
the
sick
of
denying
truth
he
that
decries
this
science
does
it
presumptuously
in
the
face
of
bible
history
and
in
defiance
of
the
direct
command
of
jesus
go
ye
into
all
the
world
and
preach
the
gospel
to
which
command
was
added
the
promise
that
his
students
should
cast
out
evils
and
heal
the
sick
he
bade
the
seventy
disciples
as
well
as
the
twelve
heal
the
sick
in
any
town
where
they
should
be
hospitably
received
christianity
scientific
if
christianity
is
not
scientific
and
science
is
not
of
god
then
there
is
no
invariable
law
and
truth
becomes
an
accident
shall
it
be
denied
that
a
system
which
works
according
to
the
scriptures
has
scriptural
authority
argument
of
good
works
christian
science
awakens
the
sinner
reclaims
the
infidel
and
raises
from
the
couch
of
pain
the
helpless
invalid
it
speaks
to
the
dumb
the
words
of
truth
and
they
answer
with
rejoicing
it
causes
the
deaf
to
hear
the
lame
to
walk
and
the
blind
to
see
who
would
be
the
first
to
disown
the
ness
of
good
works
when
our
master
says
by
their
fruits
ye
shall
know
them
if
christian
scientists
were
teaching
or
practising
pharmacy
or
obstetrics
according
to
the
common
ries
no
denunciations
would
follow
them
even
if
their
treatment
resulted
in
the
death
of
a
patient
the
people
are
taught
in
such
cases
to
say
amen
shall
i
then
be
smitten
for
healing
and
for
teaching
truth
as
the
ciple
of
healing
and
for
proving
my
word
by
my
deed
james
said
show
me
thy
faith
without
thy
works
and
i
will
show
thee
my
faith
by
my
works
personal
experience
is
not
finite
mind
ignorant
of
god
method
this
makes
it
doubly
unfair
to
impugn
and
misrepresent
the
facts
although
without
this
one
might
not
be
able
to
say
with
the
apostle
none
of
these
things
move
me
the
sick
the
halt
and
the
blind
look
up
to
christian
science
with
blessings
and
truth
will
not
be
forever
hidden
by
unjust
parody
from
the
quickened
sense
of
the
people
proof
from
miracles
jesus
strips
all
disguise
from
error
when
his
teachings
are
fully
understood
by
parable
and
argument
he
plains
the
impossibility
of
good
producing
evil
and
he
also
scientifically
demonstrates
this
great
fact
proving
by
what
are
wrongly
called
miracles
that
sin
sickness
and
death
are
beliefs
illusive
errors
which
he
could
and
did
destroy
it
would
sometimes
seem
as
if
truth
were
rejected
cause
meekness
and
spirituality
are
the
conditions
of
its
acceptance
while
christendom
generally
demands
so
much
less
example
of
the
disciples
anciently
those
apostles
who
were
jesus
students
as
well
as
paul
who
was
not
one
of
his
students
healed
the
sick
and
reformed
the
sinner
by
their
religion
hence
the
mistake
which
allows
words
rather
than
works
to
follow
such
examples
whoever
is
the
first
meekly
and
conscientiously
to
press
along
the
line
of
is
often
accounted
a
heretic
strong
position
it
is
objected
to
christian
science
that
it
claims
god
as
the
only
absolute
life
and
soul
and
man
to
be
his
idea
that
is
his
image
it
should
be
added
that
this
is
claimed
to
represent
the
normal
healthful
and
sinless
condition
of
man
in
divine
science
and
that
this
claim
is
made
because
the
tures
say
that
god
has
created
man
in
his
own
image
and
after
his
likeness
is
it
sacrilegious
to
assume
that
god
likeness
is
not
found
in
matter
sin
sickness
and
death
efficacy
may
be
attested
were
it
more
fully
understood
that
truth
heals
and
that
error
causes
disease
the
opponents
of
a
demonstrable
science
would
perhaps
mercifully
withhold
their
misrepresentations
which
harm
the
sick
and
until
the
enemies
of
christian
science
test
its
efficacy
according
to
the
rules
which
disclose
its
merits
or
merits
it
would
be
just
to
observe
the
scriptural
precept
judge
not
the
one
divine
method
there
are
various
methods
of
treating
disease
which
are
not
included
in
the
commonly
accepted
systems
but
there
is
only
one
which
should
be
presented
to
the
whole
world
and
that
is
the
christian
science
which
jesus
preached
and
practised
and
left
to
us
as
his
rich
legacy
why
should
one
refuse
to
investigate
this
method
of
treating
disease
why
support
the
popular
systems
of
medicine
when
the
physician
may
perchance
be
an
infidel
and
may
lose
patients
while
christian
science
cures
its
hundred
is
it
because
allopathy
and
homoeopathy
are
more
fashionable
and
less
spiritual
omnipotence
set
forth
in
the
bible
the
word
so
commonly
applied
to
deity
that
spirit
and
god
are
often
regarded
as
onymous
terms
and
it
is
thus
they
are
uniformly
used
and
understood
in
christian
science
as
it
is
evident
that
the
likeness
of
spirit
can
not
be
material
does
it
not
follow
that
god
can
not
be
in
his
unlikeness
and
work
through
drugs
to
heal
the
sick
when
the
omnipotence
of
god
is
preached
and
his
soluteness
is
set
forth
christian
sermons
will
heal
the
sick
contradictions
not
found
it
is
sometimes
said
in
criticising
christian
science
that
the
mind
which
contradicts
itself
neither
knows
itself
nor
what
it
is
saying
it
is
indeed
no
small
matter
to
know
one
self
but
in
this
volume
of
mine
there
are
no
contradictory
statements
at
least
none
which
are
apparent
to
those
who
understand
its
propositions
well
enough
to
pass
judgment
upon
them
one
who
understands
christian
science
can
heal
the
sick
on
the
divine
principle
of
tian
science
and
this
practical
proof
is
the
only
feasible
evidence
that
one
does
understand
this
science
anybody
who
is
able
to
perceive
the
incongruity
tween
god
idea
and
poor
humanity
ought
to
be
able
to
discern
the
distinction
made
by
christian
science
between
god
man
made
in
his
image
and
the
sinning
race
of
adam
the
apostle
says
for
if
a
man
think
himself
to
be
something
when
he
is
nothing
he
deceiveth
himself
this
thought
of
human
material
nothingness
which
science
inculcates
enrages
the
carnal
mind
and
is
the
main
cause
of
the
carnal
mind
antagonism
god
idea
the
ideal
man
it
is
not
the
purpose
of
christian
science
to
educate
the
idea
of
god
or
treat
it
for
disease
as
is
alleged
by
one
critic
i
regret
that
such
criticism
confounds
with
adam
when
man
is
spoken
of
as
made
in
image
it
is
not
sinful
and
sickly
mortal
man
who
is
referred
to
but
the
ideal
man
reflecting
god
likeness
nothingness
of
error
it
is
sometimes
said
that
christian
science
teaches
the
nothingness
of
sin
sickness
and
death
and
then
teaches
how
this
nothingness
is
to
be
saved
and
healed
the
nothingness
of
nothing
is
plain
but
we
need
to
understand
that
error
is
nothing
and
that
its
nothingness
is
not
saved
but
must
be
demonstrated
in
order
to
prove
the
somethingness
yea
the
allness
of
truth
it
is
that
we
are
harmonious
only
as
we
cease
to
manifest
evil
or
the
belief
that
we
suffer
from
the
sins
of
others
disbelief
in
error
destroys
error
and
leads
to
the
discernment
of
truth
there
are
no
vacuums
how
then
can
this
demonstration
be
fraught
with
falsities
painful
to
behold
truth
antidotes
error
we
treat
error
through
the
understanding
of
truth
because
truth
is
error
antidote
if
a
dream
ceases
it
is
and
the
terror
is
over
when
a
sufferer
is
convinced
that
there
is
no
reality
in
his
belief
of
pain
because
matter
has
no
sensation
hence
pain
in
matter
is
a
false
belief
how
can
he
suffer
longer
do
you
feel
the
pain
of
when
you
believe
that
gas
has
made
you
unconscious
yet
in
your
concept
the
tooth
the
operation
and
the
forceps
are
unchanged
serving
two
masters
material
beliefs
must
be
expelled
to
make
room
for
spiritual
understanding
we
can
not
serve
both
god
and
mammon
at
the
same
time
but
is
not
this
what
frail
mortals
are
trying
to
do
paul
says
the
flesh
lusteth
against
the
spirit
and
the
spirit
against
the
flesh
who
is
ready
to
admit
this
it
is
said
by
one
critic
that
to
verify
this
wonderful
philosophy
christian
science
declares
that
whatever
is
mortal
or
discordant
has
no
origin
existence
nor
ness
nothing
really
has
life
but
god
who
is
infinite
life
hence
all
is
life
and
death
has
no
dominion
this
writer
infers
that
if
anything
needs
to
be
doctored
it
must
be
the
one
god
or
mind
had
he
stated
his
gism
correctly
the
conclusion
would
be
that
there
is
ing
left
to
be
doctored
essential
element
of
christianity
critics
should
consider
that
the
mortal
man
is
not
the
reality
of
man
then
they
would
behold
the
signs
of
christ
coming
christ
as
the
itual
or
true
idea
of
god
comes
now
as
of
old
preaching
the
gospel
to
the
poor
ing
the
sick
and
casting
out
evils
is
it
error
which
is
restoring
an
essential
element
of
christianity
namely
apostolic
divine
healing
no
it
is
the
science
of
christianity
which
is
restoring
it
and
is
the
light
shining
in
darkness
which
the
darkness
comprehends
not
if
christian
science
takes
away
the
popular
gods
sin
sickness
and
death
it
is
christ
truth
who
stroys
these
evils
and
so
proves
their
nothingness
the
dream
that
matter
and
error
are
something
must
yield
to
reason
and
revelation
then
mortals
will
behold
the
nothingness
of
sickness
and
sin
and
sin
and
sickness
will
disappear
from
consciousness
the
harmonious
will
appear
real
and
the
nious
unreal
these
critics
will
then
see
that
error
is
indeed
the
nothingness
which
they
chide
us
for
naming
nothing
and
which
we
desire
neither
to
honor
nor
to
fear
medical
theories
virtually
admit
the
nothingness
of
hallucinations
even
while
treating
them
as
disease
and
who
objects
to
this
ought
we
not
then
to
approve
any
cure
which
is
effected
by
making
the
disease
appear
to
be
what
it
really
is
an
illusion
all
disease
a
delusion
here
is
the
difficulty
it
is
not
generally
understood
how
one
disease
can
be
just
as
much
a
delusion
as
another
it
is
a
pity
that
the
medical
faculty
and
clergy
have
not
learned
this
for
jesus
established
this
foundational
fact
when
devils
delusions
were
cast
out
and
the
dumb
spake
elimination
of
sickness
are
we
irreverent
towards
sin
or
imputing
too
much
power
to
god
when
we
ascribe
to
him
almighty
life
and
love
i
deny
his
cooperation
with
evil
because
i
desire
to
have
no
faith
in
evil
or
in
any
power
but
god
good
is
it
not
well
to
eliminate
from
mortal
mind
that
which
so
long
as
it
remains
in
mortal
mind
will
show
itself
in
forms
of
sin
sickness
and
death
instead
of
tenaciously
defending
the
supposed
rights
of
disease
while
complaining
of
the
suffering
ease
brings
would
it
not
be
well
to
abandon
the
defence
especially
when
by
so
doing
our
own
condition
can
be
proved
and
that
of
other
persons
as
well
full
fruitage
yet
to
come
i
have
never
supposed
the
world
would
immediately
witness
the
full
fruitage
of
christian
science
or
that
sin
disease
and
death
would
not
be
believed
for
an
indefinite
time
but
this
i
do
aver
that
as
a
result
of
teaching
christian
science
ethics
and
temperance
have
received
all
impulse
health
has
been
restored
and
longevity
increased
if
such
are
the
ent
fruits
what
will
the
harvest
be
when
this
science
is
more
generally
understood
law
and
gospel
as
paul
asked
of
the
unfaithful
in
ancient
days
so
the
rabbis
of
the
present
day
ask
concerning
our
ing
and
teaching
through
breaking
the
law
dishonorest
thou
god
we
have
the
gospel
however
and
our
master
annulled
material
law
by
ing
contrary
to
it
we
propose
to
follow
the
example
we
should
subordinate
material
law
to
ual
law
two
essential
points
of
christian
science
are
that
neither
life
nor
man
dies
and
that
god
is
not
the
author
of
sickness
language
inadequate
the
chief
difficulty
in
conveying
the
teachings
of
divine
science
accurately
to
human
thought
lies
in
this
that
like
all
other
languages
english
is
inadequate
to
the
expression
of
spiritual
conceptions
and
propositions
because
one
is
obliged
to
use
material
terms
in
dealing
with
spiritual
ideas
the
elucidation
of
tian
science
lies
in
its
spiritual
sense
and
this
sense
must
be
gained
by
its
disciples
in
order
to
grasp
the
meaning
of
this
science
out
of
this
condition
grew
the
prophecy
concerning
the
christian
apostles
they
shall
speak
with
new
tongues
speaking
of
the
things
of
spirit
while
dwelling
on
a
material
plane
material
terms
must
be
generally
ployed
mortal
thought
does
not
at
once
catch
the
higher
meaning
and
can
do
so
only
as
thought
is
cated
up
to
spiritual
apprehension
to
a
certain
extent
this
is
equally
true
of
all
learning
even
that
which
is
wholly
material
substance
spiritual
in
christian
science
substance
is
understood
to
be
spirit
while
the
opponents
of
christian
science
believe
substance
to
be
matter
they
think
of
matter
as
thing
and
almost
the
only
thing
and
of
the
things
which
pertain
to
spirit
as
next
to
nothing
or
as
very
far
removed
from
daily
experience
christian
science
takes
exactly
the
opposite
view
both
words
and
works
to
understand
all
our
master
sayings
as
recorded
in
the
new
testament
sayings
infinitely
important
his
followers
must
grow
into
that
stature
of
manhood
in
christ
jesus
which
enables
them
to
interpret
his
spiritual
meaning
then
they
know
how
truth
casts
out
error
and
heals
the
sick
his
words
were
the
offspring
of
his
deeds
both
of
which
must
be
understood
unless
the
works
are
prehended
which
his
words
explained
the
words
are
blind
the
master
often
refused
to
explain
his
words
because
it
was
difficult
in
a
material
age
to
apprehend
spiritual
truth
he
said
this
people
heart
is
waxed
gross
and
their
ears
are
dull
of
hearing
and
their
eyes
they
have
closed
lest
at
any
time
they
should
see
with
their
eyes
and
hear
with
their
ears
and
should
understand
with
their
heart
and
should
be
converted
and
i
should
heal
them
the
divine
the
word
was
made
flesh
divine
truth
must
be
known
by
its
effects
on
the
body
as
well
as
on
the
mind
before
the
science
of
being
can
be
strated
hence
its
embodiment
in
the
nate
jesus
that
forming
the
connection
through
which
the
real
reaches
the
unreal
soul
rebukes
sense
and
truth
destroys
error
truth
a
present
help
in
jewish
worship
the
word
was
materially
explained
and
the
spiritual
sense
was
scarcely
perceived
the
religion
which
sprang
from
israelitish
history
was
pedantic
and
void
of
healing
power
when
we
lose
faith
in
god
power
to
heal
we
distrust
the
divine
principle
which
demonstrates
christian
science
and
then
we
can
not
heal
the
sick
neither
can
we
heal
through
the
help
of
spirit
if
we
plant
ourselves
on
a
material
basis
the
author
became
a
member
of
the
orthodox
gregational
church
in
early
years
later
she
learned
that
her
own
prayers
failed
to
heal
her
as
did
the
prayers
of
her
devout
parents
and
the
church
but
when
the
spiritual
sense
of
the
creed
was
discerned
in
the
science
of
christianity
this
spiritual
sense
was
present
it
was
the
living
palpitating
presence
of
christ
truth
which
healed
the
sick
fatal
premises
we
can
not
bring
out
the
practical
proof
of
christianity
which
jesus
required
while
error
seems
as
potent
and
real
to
us
as
truth
and
while
we
make
a
sonal
devil
and
an
anthropomorphic
god
our
especially
if
we
consider
satan
as
a
being
coequal
in
power
with
deity
if
not
superior
to
him
because
such
are
neither
spiritual
nor
scientific
they
can
not
work
out
the
of
christian
healing
which
proves
the
nothingness
of
error
discord
by
demonstrating
the
of
harmonious
truth
fruitless
worship
the
israelites
centred
their
thoughts
on
the
material
in
their
attempted
worship
of
the
spiritual
to
them
matter
was
substance
and
spirit
was
shadow
they
thought
to
worship
spirit
from
a
terial
standpoint
but
this
was
impossible
they
might
appeal
to
jehovah
but
their
prayer
brought
down
no
proof
that
it
was
heard
because
they
did
not
sufficiently
understand
god
to
be
able
to
demonstrate
his
power
to
heal
to
make
harmony
the
reality
and
discord
the
unreality
spirit
the
tangible
our
master
declared
that
his
material
body
was
not
spirit
evidently
considering
it
a
mortal
and
material
lief
of
flesh
and
bones
whereas
the
jews
took
a
diametrically
opposite
view
to
jesus
not
materiality
but
spirituality
was
the
reality
of
man
istence
while
to
the
rabbis
the
spiritual
was
the
ble
and
uncertain
if
not
the
unreal
ghosts
not
realities
would
a
mother
say
to
her
child
who
is
frightened
at
imaginary
ghosts
and
sick
in
consequence
of
the
fear
i
know
that
ghosts
are
real
they
exist
and
are
to
be
feared
but
you
must
not
be
afraid
of
them
children
like
adults
to
fear
a
reality
which
can
harm
them
and
which
they
do
not
understand
for
at
any
moment
they
may
become
its
helpless
victims
but
instead
of
increasing
children
fears
by
declaring
ghosts
to
be
real
merciless
and
powerful
thus
ing
the
very
roots
of
childish
timidity
children
should
be
assured
that
their
fears
are
groundless
that
ghosts
are
not
realities
but
traditional
beliefs
erroneous
and
in
short
children
should
be
told
not
to
believe
in
ghosts
because
there
are
no
such
things
if
belief
in
their
reality
is
destroyed
terror
of
ghosts
will
depart
and
health
be
stored
the
objects
of
alarm
will
then
vanish
into
ingness
no
longer
seeming
worthy
of
fear
or
honor
to
accomplish
a
good
result
it
is
certainly
not
irrational
to
tell
the
truth
about
ghosts
the
real
and
the
unreal
the
christianly
scientific
real
is
the
sensuous
unreal
sin
disease
whatever
seems
real
to
material
sense
is
real
in
divine
science
the
physical
senses
and
science
have
ever
been
antagonistic
and
they
will
so
continue
till
the
testimony
of
the
physical
senses
yields
entirely
to
christian
science
how
can
a
christian
having
the
stronger
evidence
of
truth
which
contradicts
the
evidence
of
error
think
of
the
latter
as
real
or
true
either
in
the
form
of
sickness
or
of
sin
all
must
admit
that
christ
is
the
way
the
truth
and
the
life
and
that
omnipotent
truth
certainly
does
destroy
error
superstition
obsolete
the
age
has
not
wholly
outlived
the
sense
of
ghostly
beliefs
it
still
holds
them
more
or
less
time
has
not
yet
reached
eternity
immortality
complete
reality
all
the
real
is
eternal
perfection
underlies
reality
without
perfection
nothing
is
wholly
real
all
things
will
continue
to
disappear
until
fection
appears
and
reality
is
reached
we
must
give
up
the
spectral
at
all
points
we
must
not
continue
to
admit
the
somethingness
of
superstition
but
we
must
yield
up
all
belief
in
it
and
be
wise
when
we
learn
that
error
is
not
real
we
shall
be
ready
for
progress
forgetting
those
things
which
are
behind
the
grave
does
not
banish
the
ghost
of
materiality
so
long
as
there
are
supposed
limits
to
mind
and
those
limits
are
human
so
long
will
ghosts
seem
to
continue
mind
is
limitless
it
never
was
material
the
true
idea
of
being
is
spiritual
and
immortal
and
from
this
it
follows
that
whatever
is
laid
off
is
the
ghost
some
unreal
belief
mortal
beliefs
can
neither
demonstrate
christianity
nor
apprehend
the
reality
of
life
christian
warfare
are
the
protests
of
christian
science
against
the
notion
that
there
can
be
material
life
substance
or
mind
utter
falsities
and
absurdities
as
some
aver
why
then
do
christians
try
to
obey
the
scriptures
and
war
against
the
world
the
flesh
and
the
devil
why
do
they
invoke
the
divine
aid
to
enable
them
to
leave
all
for
christ
truth
why
do
they
use
this
phraseology
and
yet
deny
christian
science
when
it
teaches
precisely
this
thought
the
words
of
divine
science
find
their
immortality
in
deeds
for
their
principle
heals
the
sick
and
spiritualizes
humanity
healing
omitted
on
the
other
hand
the
christian
opponents
of
tian
science
neither
give
nor
offer
any
proofs
that
their
master
religion
can
heal
the
sick
surely
it
is
not
enough
to
cleave
to
barren
and
tory
dogmas
derived
from
the
traditions
of
the
elders
who
thereunto
have
set
their
seals
scientific
consistency
consistency
is
seen
in
example
more
than
in
precept
inconsistency
is
shown
by
words
without
deeds
which
are
like
clouds
without
rain
if
our
words
fail
to
express
our
deeds
god
will
redeem
that
weakness
and
out
of
the
mouth
of
babes
he
will
perfect
praise
the
night
of
materiality
is
far
spent
and
with
the
dawn
truth
will
waken
men
spiritually
to
hear
and
to
speak
the
new
tongue
sin
should
become
unreal
to
every
one
it
is
in
itself
inconsistent
a
divided
kingdom
its
supposed
realism
has
no
divine
authority
and
i
rejoice
in
the
apprehension
of
this
grand
verity
spiritual
meaning
the
opponents
of
divine
science
must
be
charitable
if
they
would
be
christian
if
the
letter
of
christian
science
appears
inconsistent
they
should
gain
the
spiritual
meaning
of
christian
science
and
then
the
ambiguity
will
vanish
practical
arguments
the
charge
of
inconsistency
in
christianly
scientific
methods
of
dealing
with
sin
and
disease
is
met
by
thing
practical
namely
the
proof
of
the
utility
of
these
methods
and
proofs
are
better
than
mere
verbal
arguments
or
prayers
which
evince
no
spiritual
power
to
heal
as
for
sin
and
disease
christian
science
says
in
the
language
of
the
master
follow
me
and
let
the
dead
bury
their
dead
let
discord
of
every
name
and
nature
be
heard
no
more
and
let
the
harmonious
and
true
sense
of
life
and
being
take
possession
of
human
consciousness
what
is
the
relative
value
of
the
two
conflicting
ories
regarding
christian
healing
one
according
to
the
commands
of
our
master
heals
the
sick
the
other
popular
religion
declines
to
admit
that
christ
religion
has
exercised
any
systematic
healing
power
since
the
first
century
conditions
of
criticism
the
statement
that
the
teachings
of
christian
ence
in
this
work
are
absolutely
false
and
the
most
egregious
fallacies
ever
offered
for
ance
is
an
opinion
wholly
due
to
a
prehension
both
of
the
divine
principle
and
practice
of
christian
science
and
to
a
consequent
inability
to
strate
this
science
without
this
understanding
no
one
is
capable
of
impartial
or
correct
criticism
because
stration
and
spiritual
understanding
are
god
immortal
keynotes
proved
to
be
such
by
our
master
and
evidenced
by
the
sick
who
are
cured
and
by
the
sinners
who
are
reformed
weakness
of
material
theories
strangely
enough
we
ask
for
material
theories
in
port
of
spiritual
and
eternal
truths
when
the
two
are
so
antagonistic
that
the
material
thought
must
become
itualized
before
the
spiritual
fact
is
attained
material
existence
affords
no
evidence
theories
of
spiritual
existence
and
immortality
sin
sickness
and
death
do
not
prove
man
entity
or
tality
discord
can
never
establish
the
facts
of
harmony
matter
is
not
the
vestibule
of
spirit
irreconciliable
differences
jesus
reasoned
on
this
subject
practically
and
trolled
sickness
sin
and
death
on
the
basis
of
his
ituality
understanding
the
nothingness
of
material
things
he
spoke
of
flesh
and
spirit
as
the
two
opposites
as
error
and
truth
not
uting
in
any
way
to
each
other
happiness
and
existence
jesus
knew
it
is
the
spirit
that
quickeneth
the
flesh
profiteth
nothing
copartnership
impossible
there
is
neither
a
present
nor
an
eternal
ship
between
error
and
truth
between
flesh
and
spirit
god
is
as
incapable
of
producing
sin
ness
and
death
as
he
is
of
experiencing
these
errors
how
then
is
it
possible
for
him
to
create
man
subject
to
this
triad
of
errors
man
who
is
made
in
the
divine
likeness
does
god
create
a
material
man
out
of
himself
spirit
does
evil
proceed
from
good
does
divine
love
mit
a
fraud
on
humanity
by
making
man
inclined
to
sin
and
then
punishing
him
for
it
would
any
one
call
it
wise
and
good
to
create
the
primitive
and
then
punish
its
derivative
two
infinite
creators
absurd
does
subsequent
follow
its
antecedent
it
does
was
there
original
sin
then
there
must
have
been
more
than
one
creator
more
than
one
god
in
common
justice
we
must
admit
that
god
will
not
punish
man
for
doing
what
he
created
man
capable
of
doing
and
knew
from
the
outset
that
man
would
do
god
is
of
purer
eyes
than
to
behold
evil
we
sustain
truth
not
by
ing
but
by
rejecting
a
lie
jesus
said
of
personified
evil
that
it
was
a
liar
and
the
father
of
it
truth
creates
neither
a
lie
a
capacity
to
lie
nor
a
liar
if
mankind
would
relinquish
the
belief
that
god
makes
sickness
sin
and
death
or
makes
man
capable
of
suffering
on
account
of
this
malevolent
triad
the
foundations
of
error
would
be
sapped
and
error
struction
ensured
but
if
we
theoretically
endow
mortals
with
the
creativeness
and
authority
of
deity
how
dare
we
attempt
to
destroy
what
he
hath
made
or
even
to
deny
that
god
made
man
evil
and
made
evil
good
anthropomorphism
history
teaches
that
the
popular
and
false
notions
about
the
divine
being
and
character
have
originated
in
the
human
mind
as
there
is
in
reality
but
one
god
one
mind
wrong
notions
about
god
must
have
originated
in
a
false
supposition
not
in
mortal
truth
and
they
are
fading
out
they
are
false
claims
which
will
eventually
disappear
according
to
the
vision
of
john
in
the
apocalypse
one
supremacy
if
what
opposes
god
is
real
there
must
be
two
powers
and
god
is
not
supreme
and
infinite
can
deity
be
almighty
if
another
mighty
and
cause
exists
and
sways
kind
has
the
father
life
in
himself
as
the
tures
say
and
if
so
can
life
or
god
dwell
in
evil
and
create
it
can
matter
drive
life
spirit
hence
and
so
defeat
omnipotence
matter
impotent
is
the
woodman
axe
which
destroys
a
tree
life
superior
to
omnipotence
can
a
leaden
bullet
prive
a
man
of
life
that
is
of
god
who
is
man
life
if
god
is
at
the
mercy
of
matter
then
matter
is
omnipotent
such
doctrines
are
sion
worse
confounded
if
two
statements
directly
tradict
each
other
and
one
is
true
the
other
must
be
false
is
science
thus
contradictory
scientific
and
biblical
facts
christian
science
understood
coincides
with
the
scriptures
and
sustains
logically
and
demonstratively
every
point
it
presents
otherwise
it
would
not
be
science
and
could
not
present
its
proofs
christian
science
is
neither
made
up
of
dictory
aphorisms
nor
of
the
inventions
of
those
who
scoff
at
god
it
presents
the
calm
and
clear
verdict
of
truth
against
error
uttered
and
illustrated
by
the
prophets
by
jesus
by
his
apostles
as
is
recorded
throughout
the
scriptures
why
are
the
words
of
jesus
more
frequently
cited
for
our
instruction
than
are
his
remarkable
works
is
it
not
because
there
are
few
who
have
gained
a
true
knowledge
of
the
great
import
to
christianity
of
those
works
personal
confidence
sometimes
it
is
said
rest
assured
that
whatever
effect
christian
scientists
may
have
on
the
sick
comes
through
rousing
within
the
sick
a
belief
that
in
the
removal
of
disease
these
healers
have
wonderful
power
derived
from
the
holy
ghost
is
it
likely
that
have
more
faith
in
some
christian
scientist
whom
they
have
perhaps
never
seen
and
against
whom
they
have
been
warned
than
they
have
in
their
own
accredited
and
orthodox
pastors
whom
they
have
seen
and
have
been
taught
to
love
and
to
trust
let
any
clergyman
try
to
cure
his
friends
by
their
faith
in
him
will
that
faith
heal
them
yet
tists
will
take
the
same
cases
and
cures
will
follow
is
this
because
the
patients
have
more
faith
in
the
tist
than
in
their
pastor
i
have
healed
infidels
whose
only
objection
to
this
method
was
that
i
as
a
tian
scientist
believed
in
the
holy
spirit
while
they
the
patients
did
not
even
though
you
aver
that
the
material
senses
are
indispensable
to
man
existence
or
entity
you
must
change
the
human
concept
of
life
and
must
at
length
know
yourself
spiritually
and
scientifically
the
dence
of
the
existence
of
spirit
soul
is
palpable
only
to
spiritual
sense
and
is
not
apparent
to
the
material
senses
which
cognize
only
that
which
is
the
opposite
of
spirit
true
christianity
is
to
be
honored
wherever
found
but
when
shall
we
arrive
at
the
goal
which
that
word
implies
from
puritan
parents
the
erer
of
christian
science
early
received
her
religious
education
in
childhood
she
often
listened
with
joy
to
these
words
falling
from
the
lips
of
her
saintly
mother
god
is
able
to
raise
you
up
from
ness
and
she
pondered
the
meaning
of
that
scripture
she
so
often
quotes
and
these
signs
shall
follow
them
that
believe
they
shall
lay
hands
on
the
sick
and
they
shall
recover
two
different
artists
a
christian
scientist
and
an
opponent
are
like
two
artists
one
says
i
have
spiritual
ideals
indestructible
and
glorious
when
others
see
them
as
i
do
in
their
true
light
and
loveliness
and
know
that
these
ideals
are
real
and
eternal
because
drawn
from
truth
they
will
find
that
nothing
is
lost
and
all
is
won
by
a
right
estimate
of
what
is
real
the
other
artist
replies
you
wrong
my
experience
i
have
no
except
those
which
are
both
mental
and
material
it
is
true
that
materiality
renders
these
ideals
imperfect
and
destructible
yet
i
would
not
change
mine
for
thine
for
mine
give
me
such
personal
pleasure
and
they
are
not
so
shockingly
transcendental
they
require
less
and
keep
soul
well
out
of
sight
moreover
i
have
no
notion
of
losing
my

shall

behold
he

and

he

of

the
jews
put
to
death
the
galilean
prophet
the
best
christian
on
earth
for
the
truth
he
spoke
and
demonstrated
while
jew
and
christian
can
unite
in
doctrine
and
denomination
on
the
very
basis
of
words
and
works
the
jew
believes
that
the
messiah
or
christ
has
not
yet
come
the
christian
believes
that
christ
is
god
here
christian
science
intervenes
plains
these
doctrinal
points
cancels
the
disagreement
and
settles
the
question
christ
as
the
true
spiritual
idea
is
the
ideal
of
god
now
and
forever
here
and
everywhere
the
jew
who
believes
in
the
first
commandment
is
a
monotheist
he
has
one
omnipresent
god
thus
the
jew
unites
with
the
christian
doctrine
that
god
is
come
and
is
present
now
and
forever
the
christian
who
believes
in
the
first
commandment
is
a
monotheist
this
he
virtually
unites
with
the
jew
belief
in
one
god
and
recognizes
that
jesus
christ
is
not
god
as
jesus
himself
declared
but
is
the
son
of
god
this
declaration
of
jesus
understood
conflicts
not
at
all
with
another
of
his
sayings
i
and
my
father
are
one
that
is
one
in
quality
not
in
quantity
as
a
drop
of
water
is
one
with
the
ocean
a

of

one
with
the
sun
even
so
god

are

we

clearer
and
fuller
expression
of
its
original
meaning
itual
ideas

as
we
advance
a
human
perception
of
divine
science
however
limited
must
be
correct
in
order
to
be
science
and
subject
to
demonstration
a
germ
of
finite
truth
though
least
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
the
higher
hope
on
earth
but
it
will
be
rejected
and
reviled
until
god
prepares
the
soil
for
the
seed
that
which
when
sown
bears
immortal
fruit
enriches
mankind
only
when

jesus
a
gospel
narrative
it
is
related
in
the
seventh
chapter
of
luke
gospel
that
jesus
was
once
the
honored
guest
of
a
certain
pharisee
by
name
simon
though
he
was
quite
unlike
simon
the
disciple
while
they
were
at
meat
an
unusual
incident
occurred
as
if
to
interrupt
the
scene
of
oriental
festivity
a
strange
woman
came
in
heedless
of
the
fact
that
she
was
debarred
from
such
a
place
and
such
society
especially
under
the
stern
rules
of
rabbinical
law
as
positively
as
if
she
were
a
doo
pariah
intruding
upon
the
household
of
a
brahman
this
woman
mary
magdalene
as
she
has
since
been
called
approached
jesus
according
to
the
custom
of
those
days
he
reclined
on
a
couch
with
his
head
towards
the
table
and
his
bare
feet
away
from
it
it
was
therefore
easy
for
the
magdalen
to
come
behind
the
couch
and
reach
his
feet
she
bore
an
alabaster
jar
containing
costly
and
fragrant
oil
sandal
oil
perhaps
which
is
in
such
common
use
in
the
east
breaking
the
sealed
jar
she
perfumed
jesus
feet
with
the
oil
wiping
them
with
her
long
hair
which
hung
loosely
about
her
shoulders
as
was
customary
with
women
of
her
grade
parable
of
the
creditor
did
jesus
spurn
the
woman
did
he
repel
her
tion
no
he
regarded
her
compassionately
nor
was
this
all
knowing
what
those
around
him
were
saying
in
their
hearts
especially
his
host
that
they
were
wondering
why
being
a
prophet
the
exalted
guest
did
not
at
once
detect
the
woman
immoral
status
and
bid
her
depart
knowing
this
jesus
rebuked
them
with
a
short
story
or
parable
he
described
two
debtors
one
for
a
large
sum
and
one
for
a
smaller
who
were
released
from
their
obligations
by
their
common
creditor
which
of
them
will
love
him
most
was
the
master
question
to
simon
the
pharisee
and
simon
plied
he
to
whom
he
forgave
most
jesus
approved
the
answer
and
so
brought
home
the
lesson
to
all
ing
it
with
that
remarkable
declaration
to
the
woman
thy
sins
are
forgiven
divine
insight
why
did
he
thus
summarize
her
debt
to
divine
love
had
she
repented
and
reformed
and
did
his
insight
detect
this
unspoken
moral
uprising
she
bathed
his
feet
with
her
tears
before
she
anointed
them
with
the
oil
in
the
absence
of
other
proofs
was
her
grief
sufficient
evidence
to
warrant
the
expectation
of
her
repentance
reformation
and
growth
in
wisdom
certainly
there
was
encouragement
in
the
mere
fact
that
she
was
showing
her
affection
for
a
man
of
undoubted
goodness
and
purity
who
has
since
been
rightfully
regarded
as
the
best
man
that
ever
trod
this
planet
her
reverence
was
unfeigned
and
it
was
fested
towards
one
who
was
soon
though
they
knew
it
not
to
lay
down
his
mortal
existence
in
behalf
of
all
sinners
that
through
his
word
and
works
they
might
be
redeemed
from
sensuality
and
sin
penitence
or
hospitality
which
was
the
higher
tribute
to
such
ineffable
tion
the
hospitality
of
the
pharisee
or
the
contrition
of
the
magdalen
this
query
jesus
answered
by
rebuking
and
declaring
the
absolution
of
the
penitent
he
even
said
that
this
poor
woman
had
done
what
his
rich
entertainer
had
lected
to
do
wash
and
anoint
his
guest
feet
a
special
sign
of
oriental
courtesy
here
is
suggested
a
solemn
question
a
question
cated
by
one
of
the
needs
of
this
age
do
christian
scientists
seek
truth
as
simon
sought
the
saviour
through
material
conservatism
and
for
personal
homage
jesus
told
simon
that
such
seekers
as
he
gave
small
reward
in
return
for
the
spiritual
purgation
which
came
through
the
messiah
if
christian
scientists
are
like
simon
then
it
must
be
said
of
them
also
that
they
little
genuine
repentance
on
the
other
hand
do
they
show
their
regard
for
truth
or
christ
by
their
genuine
repentance
by
their
broken
hearts
expressed
by
meekness
and
human
affection
as
did
this
woman
if
so
then
it
may
be
said
of
them
as
jesus
said
of
the
unwelcome
visitor
that
they
indeed
love
much
because
much
is
forgiven
them
compassion
requisite
did
the
careless
doctor
the
nurse
the
cook
and
the
brusque
business
visitor
sympathetically
know
the
thorns
they
plant
in
the
pillow
of
the
sick
and
the
heavenly
homesick
looking
away
from
earth
oh
did
they
know
this
knowledge
would
do
much
more
towards
healing
the
sick
and
preparing
their
helpers
for
the
midnight
call
than
all
cries
of
lord
lord
the
benign
thought
of
jesus
finding
utterance
in
such
words
as
take
no
thought
for
your
life
would
heal
the
sick
and
so
enable
them
to
rise
above
the
supposed
necessity
for
physical
and
doctoring
but
if
the
unselfish
affections
be
lacking
and
common
sense
and
common
humanity
are
disregarded
what
tal
quality
remains
with
which
to
evoke
healing
from
the
outstretched
arm
of
righteousness
speedy
healing
if
the
scientist
reaches
his
patient
through
divine
love
the
healing
work
will
be
accomplished
at
one
visit
and
the
disease
will
vanish
into
its
native
nothingness
like
dew
before
the
morning
shine
if
the
scientist
has
enough
christly
affection
to
win
his
own
pardon
and
such
commendation
as
the
dalen
gained
from
jesus
then
he
is
christian
enough
to
practise
scientifically
and
deal
with
his
patients
sionately
and
the
result
will
correspond
with
the
spiritual
intent
truth
desecrated
if
hypocrisy
stolidity
inhumanity
or
vice
finds
its
way
into
the
chambers
of
disease
through
the
healer
it
would
if
it
were
possible
convert
into
a
den
of
thieves
the
temple
of
the
holy
ghost
the
patient
spiritual
power
to
resuscitate
self
the
unchristian
practitioner
is
not
giving
to
mind
or
body
the
joy
and
strength
of
truth
the
poor
fering
heart
needs
its
rightful
nutriment
such
as
peace
patience
in
tribulation
and
a
priceless
sense
of
the
dear
father
moral
evils
to
be
cast
out
in
order
to
cure
his
patient
the
metaphysician
must
first
cast
moral
evils
out
of
himself
and
thus
attain
the
spiritual
freedom
which
will
able
him
to
cast
physical
evils
out
of
his
patient
but
heal
he
can
not
while
his
own
spiritual
barrenness
debars
him
from
giving
drink
to
the
thirsty
and
hinders
him
from
reaching
his
patient
thought
yea
while
mental
penury
chills
his
faith
and
standing
the
true
physician
the
physician
who
lacks
sympathy
for
his
being
is
deficient
in
human
affection
and
we
have
the
apostolic
warrant
for
asking
he
that
loveth
not
his
brother
whom
he
hath
seen
how
can
he
love
god
whom
he
hath
not
seen
not
having
this
spiritual
affection
the
physician
lacks
faith
in
the
divine
mind
and
has
not
that
recognition
of
infinite
love
which
alone
confers
the
healing
power
such
tists
will
strain
out
gnats
while
they
swallow
the
camels
of
bigoted
pedantry
source
of
calmness
the
physician
must
also
watch
lest
he
be
whelmed
by
a
sense
of
the
odiousness
of
sin
and
by
the
unveiling
of
sin
in
his
own
thoughts
the
sick
are
terrified
by
their
sick
beliefs
and
sinners
should
be
affrighted
by
their
sinful
beliefs
but
the
christian
scientist
will
be
calm
in
the
presence
of
both
sin
and
disease
knowing
as
he
does
that
life
is
god
and
god
is
all
genuine
healing
if
we
would
open
their
prison
doors
for
the
sick
we
must
first
learn
to
bind
up
the
if
we
would
heal
by
the
spirit
we
must
not
hide
the
talent
of
spiritual
healing
under
the
napkin
of
its
form
nor
bury
the
christian
science
in
the
of
its
letter
the
tender
word
and
christian
encouragement
of
an
invalid
pitiful
patience
with
his
fears
and
the
removal
of
them
are
better
than
hecatombs
of
gushing
theories
stereotyped
borrowed
speeches
and
the
doling
of
arguments
which
are
but
so
many
parodies
on
legitimate
christian
science
aflame
with
divine
love
gratitude
and
humility
this
is
what
is
meant
by
seeking
truth
christ
not
for
the
loaves
and
fishes
nor
like
the
pharisee
with
the
arrogance
of
rank
and
display
of
ship
but
like
mary
magdalene
from
the
mit
of
devout
consecration
with
the
oil
of
gladness
and
the
perfume
of
with
tears
of
repentance
and
with
those
hairs
all
numbered
by
the
father
the
salt
of
the
earth
a
christian
scientist
occupies
the
place
at
this
period
of
which
jesus
spoke
to
his
disciples
when
he
said
ye
are
the
salt
of
the
earth
ye
are
the
light
of
the
world
a
city
that
is
set
on
an
hill
not
be
hid
let
us
watch
work
and
pray
that
this
salt
lose
not
its
saltness
and
that
this
light
be
not
hid
but
radiate
and
glow
into
noontide
glory
the
infinite
truth
of
the
has
come
to
this
age
through
a
still
small
voice
through
silent
ances
and
divine
anointing
which
quicken
and
increase
the
beneficial
effects
of
christianity
i
long
to
see
the
consummation
of
my
hope
namely
the
student
higher
attainments
in
this
line
of
light
real
and
counterfeit
because
truth
is
infinite
error
should
be
known
as
nothing
because
truth
is
omnipotent
in
goodness
error
truth
opposite
has
no
might
evil
is
but
the
counterpoise
of
nothingness
the
greatest
wrong
is
but
a
supposititious
opposite
of
the
highest
right
the
confidence
inspired
by
science
lies
in
the
fact
that
truth
is
real
and
error
is
unreal
error
is
a
coward
before
truth
divine
science
insists
that
time
will
prove
all
this
both
truth
and
error
have
come
nearer
than
ever
before
to
the
apprehension
of
mortals
and
truth
will
become
still
clearer
as
error
is
destroyed
results
of
faith
in
truth
against
the
fatal
beliefs
that
error
is
as
real
as
truth
that
evil
is
equal
in
power
to
good
if
not
superior
and
that
discord
is
as
normal
as
harmony
even
the
hope
of
freedom
from
the
bondage
of
sickness
and
sin
has
little
inspiration
to
nerve
endeavor
when
we
come
to
have
more
faith
in
the
truth
of
being
than
we
have
in
error
more
faith
in
spirit
than
in
matter
more
faith
in
living
than
in
dying
more
faith
in
god
than
in
man
then
no
material
suppositions
can
prevent
us
from
healing
the
sick
and
destroying
error
life
independent
of
matter
that
life
is
not
contingent
on
bodily
conditions
is
proved
when
we
learn
that
life
and
man
survive
this
body
neither
evil
disease
nor
death
can
be
spiritual
and
the
material
belief
in
them
appears
in
the
ratio
of
one
spiritual
growth
because
matter
has
no
consciousness
or
ego
it
can
not
act
its
conditions
are
illusions
and
these
false
conditions
are
the
source
of
all
seeming
sickness
admit
the
existence
of
matter
and
you
admit
that
mortality
and
therefore
ease
has
a
foundation
in
fact
deny
the
existence
of
matter
and
you
can
destroy
the
belief
in
material
ditions
when
fear
disappears
the
foundation
of
disease
is
gone
once
let
the
mental
physician
believe
in
the
reality
of
matter
and
he
is
liable
to
admit
also
the
reality
of
all
discordant
conditions
and
this
hinders
his
stroying
them
thus
he
is
unfitted
for
the
successful
treatment
of
disease
man
entity
in
proportion
as
matter
loses
to
human
sense
all
tity
as
man
in
that
proportion
does
man
become
its
master
he
enters
into
a
diviner
sense
of
the
facts
and
comprehends
the
theology
of
jesus
as
demonstrated
in
healing
the
sick
raising
the
dead
and
walking
over
the
wave
all
these
deeds
manifested
jesus
control
over
the
belief
that
matter
is
substance
that
it
can
be
the
arbiter
of
life
or
the
constructor
of
any
form
of
existence
the
christ
treatment
we
never
read
that
luke
or
paul
made
a
reality
of
disease
in
order
to
discover
some
means
of
healing
it
jesus
never
asked
if
disease
were
acute
or
chronic
and
he
never
recommended
tion
to
laws
of
health
never
give
drugs
never
prayed
to
know
if
god
were
willing
that
a
man
should
live
he
understood
man
whose
life
is
god
to
be
immortal
and
knew
that
man
has
not
two
lives
one
to
be
destroyed
and
the
other
to
be
made
indestructible
matter
not
medicine
the
prophylactic
and
therapeutic
that
is
the
ive
and
curative
arts
belong
emphatically
to
christian
science
as
would
be
readily
seen
if
psychology
or
the
science
of
spirit
god
was
understood
unscientific
methods
are
finding
their
dead
level
ited
to
matter
by
their
own
law
what
have
they
of
the
advantages
of
mind
and
immortality
no
healing
in
sin
no
man
is
physically
healed
in
wilful
error
or
by
it
any
more
than
he
is
morally
saved
in
or
by
sin
it
is
error
even
to
murmur
or
to
be
angry
over
sin
to
be
every
whit
whole
man
must
be
better
spiritually
as
well
as
physically
to
be
immortal
we
must
forsake
the
mortal
sense
of
things
turn
from
the
lie
of
false
belief
to
truth
and
gather
the
facts
of
being
from
the
divine
mind
the
body
improves
under
the
same
regimen
which
spiritualizes
the
thought
and
if
health
is
not
made
manifest
under
this
regimen
this
proves
that
fear
is
governing
the
body
this
is
the
law
of
cause
and
effect
or
like
producing
like
like
curing
like
homoeopathy
furnishes
the
evidence
to
the
senses
that
symptoms
which
might
be
produced
by
a
certain
drug
are
removed
by
using
the
same
drug
which
might
cause
the
symptoms
this
confirms
my
theory
that
faith
in
the
drug
is
the
sole
factor
in
the
cure
the
effect
which
mortal
mind
produces
through
one
belief
it
removes
through
an
opposite
belief
but
it
uses
the
same
medicine
in
both
cases
the
moral
and
spiritual
facts
of
health
whispered
into
thought
produce
very
direct
and
marked
effects
on
the
body
a
physical
diagnosis
of
disease
since
tal
mind
must
be
the
cause
of
disease
tends
to
induce
disease
transient
potency
of
drugs
according
to
both
medical
testimony
and
individual
experience
a
drug
may
eventually
lose
its
supposed
power
and
do
no
more
for
the
patient
hygienic
treatment
also
loses
its
efficacy
quackery
likewise
fails
at
length
to
inspire
the
credulity
of
the
sick
and
then
they
cease
to
improve
these
sons
are
useful
they
should
naturally
and
genuinely
change
our
basis
from
sensation
to
christian
science
from
error
to
truth
from
matter
to
spirit
diagnosis
of
matter
physicians
examine
the
pulse
tongue
lungs
to
cover
the
condition
of
matter
when
in
fact
all
is
mind
the
body
is
the
substratum
of
mortal
mind
and
this
mind
must
finally
yield
to
the
mandate
of
immortal
mind
inducing
fear
disquisitions
on
disease
have
a
mental
effect
similar
to
that
produced
on
children
by
telling
in
the
dark
by
those
uninstructed
in
christian
science
nothing
is
really
understood
of
material
existence
mortals
are
believed
to
be
here
without
their
consent
and
to
be
removed
as
involuntarily
not
knowing
why
nor
when
as
frightened
children
look
everywhere
for
the
imaginary
ghost
so
sick
humanity
sees
danger
in
every
direction
and
looks
for
relief
in
all
ways
except
the
right
one
darkness
induces
fear
the
adult
in
age
to
his
beliefs
no
more
comprehends
his
real
being
than
does
the
child
and
the
adult
must
be
taken
out
of
his
darkness
before
he
can
get
rid
of
the
illusive
ings
which
throng
the
gloaming
the
way
in
divine
science
is
the
only
way
out
of
this
condition
mind
imparts
purity
health
and
beauty
i
would
not
transform
the
infant
at
once
into
a
man
nor
would
i
keep
the
suckling
a
lifelong
babe
no
impossible
thing
do
i
ask
when
urging
the
claims
of
christian
science
but
because
this
teaching
is
in
advance
of
the
age
we
should
not
deny
our
need
of
its
spiritual
unfoldment
mankind
will
improve
through
science
and
anity
the
necessity
for
uplifting
the
race
is
father
to
the
fact
that
mind
can
do
it
for
mind
can
impart
purity
instead
of
impurity
strength
instead
of
ness
and
health
instead
of
disease
truth
is
an
tive
in
the
entire
system
and
can
make
it
every
whit
whole
brain
not
intelligent
remember
brain
is
not
mind
matter
can
not
be
sick
and
mind
is
immortal
the
mortal
body
is
only
an
neous
mortal
belief
of
mind
in
matter
what
you
call
matter
was
originally
error
in
tion
elementary
mortal
mind
likened
by
milton
to
chaos
and
old
night
one
theory
about
this
mortal
mind
is
that
its
sensations
can
reproduce
man
can
form
blood
flesh
and
bones
the
science
of
being
in
which
all
is
divine
mind
or
god
and
his
idea
would
be
clearer
in
this
age
but
for
the
belief
that
matter
is
the
medium
of
man
or
that
man
can
enter
his
own
embodied
thought
bind
himself
with
his
own
beliefs
and
then
call
his
bonds
material
and
name
them
divine
law
veritable
success
when
man
demonstrates
christian
science
absolutely
he
will
be
perfect
he
can
neither
sin
suffer
be
subject
to
matter
nor
disobey
the
law
of
god
fore
he
will
be
as
the
angels
in
heaven
tian
science
and
christianity
are
one
how
then
in
christianity
any
more
than
in
christian
science
can
we
believe
in
the
reality
and
power
of
both
truth
and
error
spirit
and
matter
and
hope
to
succeed
with
contraries
matter
is
not
its
false
supports
fail
one
after
another
matter
succeeds
for
a
period
only
by
falsely
parading
in
the
vestments
of
law
recognition
of
benefits
whosoever
shall
deny
me
before
men
him
will
i
also
deny
before
my
father
which
is
in
heaven
in
tian
science
a
denial
of
truth
is
fatal
while
a
just
acknowledgment
of
truth
and
of
what
it
has
done
for
us
is
an
effectual
help
if
pride
stition
or
any
error
prevents
the
honest
recognition
of
benefits
received
this
will
be
a
hindrance
to
the
recovery
of
the
sick
and
the
success
of
the
student
disease
far
more
docile
than
iniquity
if
we
are
christians
on
all
moral
questions
but
are
in
darkness
as
to
the
physical
exemption
which
ity
includes
then
we
must
have
more
faith
in
god
on
this
subject
and
be
more
alive
to
his
promises
it
is
easier
to
cure
the
most
malignant
disease
than
it
is
to
cure
sin
the
author
has
raised
up
the
dying
partly
because
they
were
willing
to
be
restored
while
she
has
struggled
long
and
perhaps
in
vain
to
lift
a
student
out
of
a
chronic
sin
under
all
modes
of
pathological
treatment
the
sick
recover
more
rapidly
from
disease
than
does
the
sinner
from
his
sin
healing
is
easier
than
teaching
if
the
teaching
is
faithfully
done
love
frees
from
fear
the
fear
of
disease
and
the
love
of
sin
are
the
sources
of
man
enslavement
the
fear
of
the
lord
is
the
beginning
of
wisdom
but
the
scriptures
also
declare
through
the
exalted
thought
of
john
that
perfect
love
casteth
out
fear
the
fear
occasioned
by
ignorance
can
be
cured
but
to
remove
the
effects
of
fear
produced
by
sin
you
must
rise
above
both
fear
and
sin
disease
is
expressed
not
so
much
by
the
lips
as
in
the
functions
of
the
body
tablish
the
scientific
sense
of
health
and
you
relieve
the
oppressed
organ
the
inflammation
decomposition
or
deposit
will
abate
and
the
disabled
organ
will
resume
its
healthy
functions
mind
circulates
blood
when
the
blood
rushes
madly
through
the
veins
or
languidly
creeps
along
its
frozen
channels
we
call
these
conditions
disease
this
is
a
misconception
mortal
mind
is
producing
the
propulsion
or
the
languor
and
we
prove
this
to
be
so
when
by
mental
means
the
circulation
is
changed
and
returns
to
that
standard
which
mortal
mind
has
decided
upon
as
essential
for
health
anodynes
and
depletion
never
reduce
inflammation
scientifically
but
the
truth
of
being
whispered
into
the
ear
of
mortal
mind
will
bring
relief
mind
can
destroy
all
ills
hatred
and
its
effects
on
the
body
are
removed
by
love
because
mortal
mind
seems
to
be
conscious
the
sick
say
how
can
my
mind
cause
a
disease
i
never
thought
of
and
knew
nothing
about
until
it
appeared
on
my
body
the
author
has
swered
this
question
in
her
explanation
of
disease
as
nating
in
human
belief
before
it
is
consciously
apparent
on
the
body
which
is
in
fact
the
objective
state
of
mortal
mind
though
it
is
called
matter
this
mortal
blindness
and
its
sharp
consequences
show
our
need
of
divine
physics
through
immortal
mind
or
truth
we
can
destroy
all
ills
which
proceed
from
mortal
mind
ignorance
of
the
cause
or
approach
of
disease
is
no
argument
against
the
mental
origin
of
disease
you
fess
to
ignorance
of
the
future
and
incapacity
to
preserve
your
own
existence
and
this
belief
helps
rather
than
hinders
disease
such
a
state
of
mind
induces
sickness
it
is
like
walking
in
darkness
on
the
edge
of
a
precipice
you
can
not
forget
the
belief
of
danger
and
your
steps
are
less
firm
because
of
your
fear
and
ignorance
of
mental
cause
and
effect
temperature
is
mental
heat
and
cold
are
products
of
mortal
mind
the
body
when
bereft
of
mortal
mind
at
first
cools
and
wards
it
is
resolved
into
its
primitive
mortal
elements
nothing
that
lives
ever
dies
and
mortal
mind
produces
animal
heat
and
then
expels
it
through
the
abandonment
of
a
belief
or
creases
it
to
the
point
of
hence
it
is
mortal
mind
not
matter
which
says
i
die
heat
would
pass
from
the
body
as
painlessly
as
gas
dissipates
into
the
air
when
it
evaporates
but
for
the
belief
that
flammation
and
pain
must
accompany
the
separation
of
heat
from
the
body
science
chills
and
heat
are
often
the
form
in
which
fever
fests
itself
change
the
mental
state
and
the
chills
and
fever
disappear
the
physician
proves
this
when
his
patient
says
i
am
better
but
the
patient
believes
that
matter
not
mind
has
helped
him
the
christian
scientist
demonstrates
that
divine
mind
heals
while
the
hypnotist
dispossesses
the
patient
of
his
individuality
in
order
to
control
him
no
person
is
benefited
by
yielding
his
mentality
to
any
mental
despotism
or
malpractice
all
unscientific
mental
practice
is
erroneous
and
powerless
and
should
be
stood
and
so
rendered
fruitless
the
genuine
christian
scientist
is
adding
to
his
patient
mental
and
moral
power
and
is
increasing
his
patient
spirituality
while
restoring
him

through
divine
love

the

mortal

that
muscles
have
no

mind
is
supreme
and
you

latent
fear
diagnosed
consumptive
patients
always
show
great
ness
and
courage
even
when
they
are
supposed
to
be
in
hopeless
danger
this
state
of
mind
seems
anomalous
except
to
the
expert
in
christian
science
this
mental
state
is
not
understood
simply
because
it
is
a
stage
of
fear
so
excessive
that
it
amounts
to
fortitude
the
belief
in
consumption
presents
to
tal
thought
a
hopeless
state
an
image
more
terrifying
than
that
of
most
other
diseases
the
patient
turns
tarily
from
the
contemplation
of
it
but
though
edged
the
latent
fear
and
the
despair
of
recovery
remain
in
thought
insidious
concepts
just
so
is
it
with
the
greatest
sin
it
is
the
most
subtle
and
does
its
work
almost
the
diseases
deemed
dangerous
sometimes
come
from
the
most
hidden
undefined
and
insidious
beliefs
the
pallid
invalid
whom
you
declare
to
be
wasting
away
with
consumption
of
the
blood
should
be
told
that
blood
never
gave
life
and
can
never
take
it
away
that
life
is
spirit
and
that
there
is
more
life
and
immortality
in
one
good
motive
and
act
than
in
all
the
blood
which
ever
flowed
through
mortal
veins
and
simulated
a
corporeal
sense
of
life
remedy
for
fever
if
the
body
is
material
it
can
not
for
that
very
reason
suffer
with
a
fever
because
the
material
body
is
a
mental
concept
and
governed
by
mortal
mind
it
manifests
only
what
that
mind
expresses
therefore
the
efficient
remedy
is
to
destroy
the
patient
false
belief
by
both
silently
and
dibly
arguing
the
true
facts
in
regard
to
harmonious
being
representing
man
as
healthy
instead
of
diseased
and
showing
that
it
is
impossible
for
matter
to
suffer
to
feel
pain
or
heat
to
be
thirsty
or
sick
destroy
fear
and
you
end
fever
some
people
mistaught
as
to
science
inquire
when
it
will
be
safe
to
check
a
fever
know
that
in
science
you
can
not
check
a
fever
after
mitting
that
it
must
have
its
course
to
fear
and
admit
the
power
of
disease
is
to
paralyze
mental
and
scientific
demonstration
if
your
patient
believes
in
taking
cold
mentally
vince
him
that
matter
can
not
take
cold
and
that
thought
governs
this
liability
if
grief
causes
suffering
convince
the
sufferer
that
affliction
is
often
the
source
of
joy
and
that
he
should
rejoice
always
in
love
climate
harmless
invalids
flee
to
tropical
climates
in
order
to
save
their
lives
but
they
come
back
no
better
than
when
they
went
away
then
is
the
time
to
cure
them
through
christian
science
and
prove
that
they
can
be
healthy
in
all
climates
when
their
fear
of
climate
is
exterminated
mind
governs
body
through
different
states
of
mind
the
body
becomes
suddenly
weak
or
abnormally
strong
showing
mortal
mind
to
be
the
producer
of
strength
or
ness
a
sudden
joy
or
grief
has
caused
what
is
termed
instantaneous
death
because
a
belief
nates
unseen
the
mental
state
should
be
continually
watched
that
it
may
not
produce
blindly
its
bad
effects
the
author
never
knew
a
patient
who
did
not
recover
when
the
belief
of
the
disease
had
gone
remove
the
leading
error
or
governing
fear
of
this
lower
mind
and
you
remove
the
cause
of
all
disease
as
well
as
the
bid
or
excited
action
of
any
organ
you
also
remove
in
this
way
what
are
termed
organic
diseases
as
readily
as
functional
difficulties
the
cause
of
all
disease
is
mental
a
mortal
fear
a
mistaken
belief
or
conviction
of
the
necessity
and
power
of
also
a
fear
that
mind
is
helpless
to
defend
the
life
of
man
and
incompetent
to
control
it
out
this
ignorant
human
belief
any
circumstance
is
of
self
powerless
to
produce
suffering
it
is
latent
belief
in
disease
as
well
as
the
fear
of
disease
which
associates
ness
with
certain
circumstances
and
causes
the
two
to
appear
conjoined
even
as
poetry
and
music
are
duced
in
union
by
human
memory
disease
has
no
telligence
unwittingly
you
sentence
yourself
to
suffer
the
understanding
of
this
will
enable
you
to
commute
this
and
meet
every
circumstance
with
truth
disease
is
less
than
mind
and
mind
can
control
it
latent
power
without
the
human
mind
there
can
be
no
inflammatory
nor
torpid
action
of
the
system
remove
the
error
and
you
destroy
its
effects
by
looking
a
tiger
fearlessly
in
the
eye
sir
charles
napier
sent
it
cowering
back
into
the
jungle
an
mal
may
infuriate
another
by
looking
it
in
the
eye
and
both
will
fight
for
nothing
a
man
gaze
fastened
fearlessly
on
a
ferocious
beast
often
causes
the
beast
to
retreat
in
terror
this
latter
occurrence
represents
the
power
of
truth
over
error
the
might
of
intelligence
exercised
over
mortal
beliefs
to
destroy
them
whereas
hypnotism
and
hygienic
drilling
and
drugging
adopted
to
cure
matter
is
represented
by
two
material
erroneous
bases
disease
powerless
disease
is
not
an
intelligence
to
dispute
the
empire
of
mind
or
to
dethrone
mind
and
take
the
government
into
its
own
hands
sickness
is
not
a
nor
a
material
power
which
copes
astutely
with
mind
and
finally
conquers
it
god
never
endowed
matter
with
power
to
disable
life
or
to
chill
harmony
with
a
long
and
cold
night
of
discord
such
a
power
without
the
divine
permission
is
ceivable
and
if
such
a
power
could
be
divinely
directed
it
would
manifest
less
wisdom
than
we
usually
find
played
in
human
governments
jurisdiction
of
mind
if
disease
can
attack
and
control
the
body
without
the
consent
of
mortals
sin
can
do
the
same
for
both
are
errors
announced
as
partners
in
the
ginning
the
christian
scientist
finds
only
effects
where
the
ordinary
physician
looks
for
causes
the
real
jurisdiction
of
the
world
is
in
mind
controlling
every
effect
and
recognizing
all
causation
as
vested
in
divine
mind
power
of
imagination
a
felon
on
whom
certain
english
students
mented
fancied
himself
bleeding
to
death
and
died
cause
of
that
belief
when
only
a
stream
of
warm
water
was
trickling
over
his
arm
had
he
known
his
sense
of
bleeding
was
an
illusion
he
would
have
risen
above
the
false
belief
let
the
despairing
valid
inspecting
the
hue
of

on

cambric
kerchief
think
of
the
experiment
of
those
oxford
boys
who
caused
the
death
of
a
man
when
not
a
drop
of
his
blood
was
shed
then
let
her
learn
the
opposite
ment
of
life
as
taught
in
christian
science
and
she
will
understand
that
she
is
not
dying
on
account
of
the
state
of
her
blood
but
is
suffering
from
her
belief
that
blood
is
destroying
her
life
the
vital
current
does
not
affect
the
invalid
health
but
her
belief
produces
the
very
results
she
dreads
fevers
the
effect
of
fear
fevers
are
errors
of
various
types
the
quickened
pulse
coated
tongue
febrile
heat
dry
skin
pain
in
the
head
and
limbs
are
pictures
drawn
on
the
body
by
a
mortal
mind
the
images
held
in
this
disturbed
mind
frighten
conscious
thought
unless
the
drawn
by
millions
of
mortals
and
aged
on
the
body
through
the
belief
that
mind
is
in
matter
and
discord
is
as
real
as
harmony
is
destroyed
through
science
it
may
rest
at
length
on
some
receptive
thought
and
become
a
fever
case
which
ends
in
a
belief
called
death
which
belief
must
be
finally
conquered
by
eternal
life
truth
is
always
the
victor
sickness
and
sin
fall
by
their
own
weight
truth
is
the
rock
of
ages
the
stone
of
the
corner
but
on
whomsoever
it
shall
fall
it
will
grind
him
to
powder
misdirected
contention
contending
for
the
evidence
or
indulging
the
demands
of
sin
disease
or
death
we
virtually
contend
against
the
control
of
mind
over
body
and
deny
the
power
of
mind
to
heal
this
false
method
is
as
though
the
defendant
should
argue
for
the
plaintiff
in
favor
of
a
decision
which
the
defendant
knows
will
be
turned
against
himself
benefits
of
metaphysics
the
physical
effects
of
fear
illustrate
its
illusion
ing
at
a
chained
lion
crouched
for
a
spring
should
not
terrify
a
man
the
body
is
affected
only
with
the
belief
of
disease
produced
by
a
mind
ignorant
of
the
truth
which
chains

but
the
power
of

can
prevent
the
fear
of

and
prove
man
dominion
over

a
higher
discovery
many
years
ago
the
author
made
a
spiritual
ery
the
scientific
evidence
of
which
has
accumulated
to
prove
that
the
divine
mind
produces
in
man
health
harmony
and
immortality
ally
this
evidence
will
gather
momentum
and
clearness
until
it
reaches
its
culmination
of
scientific
statement
and
proof
nothing
is
more
disheartening
than
to
believe
that
there
is
a
power
opposite
to
god
or
good
and
that
god
endows
this
opposing
power
with
strength
to
be
used
against
himself
against
life

harmony
ignorance
of
our
rights
every
law
of

or
the
body
supposed
to
govern
man
is
rendered
null
and
void
by
the
law
of
life
god
ignorant
of
our
rights
we
submit
to
unjust
decrees
and
the
bias
of
education
enforces
this
slavery
be
no
more
willing
to
suffer
the
illusion
that
you
are
sick
or
that
some
disease
is
ing
in
the
system
than
you
are
to
yield
to
a
sinful
tation
on
the
ground
that
sin
has
its
necessities
no
laws
of
matter
when
infringing
some
supposed
law
you
say
that
there
is
danger
this
fear
is
the
danger
and
induces
the
physical
effects
we
can
not
in
reality
suffer
from
breaking
anything
except
a
moral
or
spiritual
law
the
laws
of
mortal
belief
are
destroyed
by
the
understanding
that
soul
is
immortal
and
that
mortal
mind
can
not
legislate
the
times
periods
and
types
of
disease
with
which
mortals
die
god
is
the
lawmaker
but
he
is
not
the
author
of
barbarous
codes
in
infinite
life
and
love
there
is
no
sickness
sin
nor
death
and
the
scriptures
declare
that
we
live
move
and
have
our
being
in
the
infinite
god
dominion
think
less
of
the
enactments
of
mortal
mind
and
you
will
sooner
grasp
man
dominion
you
must
understand
your
way
out
of
human
theories
relating
to
health
or
you
will
never
believe
that
you
are
quite
free
from
some
ailment
the
mony
and
immortality
of
man
will
never
be
reached
without
the
understanding
that
mind
is
not
in
matter
let
us
banish
sickness
as
an
outlaw
and
abide
by
the
rule
of
perpetual
harmony
god
law
it
is
moral
right
to
annul
an
unjust
sentence
a
sentence
never
inflicted
by
divine
authority
begin
rightly
christ
jesus
overruled
the
error
which
would
impose
penalties
for
transgressions
of
the
physical
laws
of
health
he
annulled
supposed
laws
of
matter
opposed
to
the
harmonies
of
spirit
lacking
divine
thority
and
having
only
human
approval
for
their
sanction
hygiene
excessive
if
half
the
attention
given
to
hygiene
were
given
to
the
study
of
christian
science
and
to
the
spiritualization
of
thought
this
alone
would
usher
in
the
inium
constant
bathing
and
rubbing
to
alter
the
secretions
or
to
remove
unhealthy
exhalations
from
the
cuticle
receive
a
useful
rebuke
from
jesus
precept
take
no
thought
for
the
body
we
must
beware
of
making
clean
merely
the
outside
of
the
platter
blissful
ignorance
he
who
is
ignorant
of
what
is
termed
hygienic
law
is
more
receptive
of
spiritual
power
and
of
faith
in
one
god
than
is
the
devotee
of
supposed
hygienic
law
who
comes
to
teach
the
rant
one
must
we
not
then
consider
the
law
of
matter
a
canon
more
honored
in
the
breach
than
the
observance
a
patient
thoroughly
booked
in
cal
theories
is
more
difficult
to
heal
through
mind
than
one
who
is
not
this
verifies
the
saying
of
our
master
whosoever
shall
not
receive
the
kingdom
of
god
as
a
little
child
shall
in
no
wise
enter
therein
one
whom
i
rescued
from
seeming
spiritual
oblivion
in
which
the
senses
had
engulfed
him
wrote
to
me
i
should
have
died
but
for
the
glorious
principle
you
teach
supporting
the
power
of
mind
over
the
body
and
ing
me
the
nothingness
of
the
pleasures
and
pains
of
sense
the
treatises
i
had
read
and
the
medicines
i
had
taken
only
abandoned
me
to
more
hopeless
suffering
and
despair
adherence
to
hygiene
was
useless
mortal
mind
needed
to
be
set
right
the
ailment
was
not
bodily
but
mental
and
i
was
cured
when
i
learned
my
way
in
christian
science
a
clean
mind
and
body
we
need
a
clean
body
and
a
clean
mind
a
body
rendered
pure
by
mind
as
well
as
washed
by
water
one
says
i
take
good
care
of
my
body
to
do
this
the
pure
and
exalting
influence
of
the
divine
mind
on
the
body
is
requisite
and
the
christian
scientist
takes
the
best
care
of
his
body
when
he
leaves
it
most
out
of
his
thought
and
like
the
apostle
paul
is
willing
rather
to
be
absent
from
the
body
and
to
be
ent
with
the
lord
a
hint
may
be
taken
from
the
emigrant
whose
filth
does
not
affect
his
happiness
because
mind
and
body
rest
on
the
same
basis
to
the
mind
equally
gross
dirt
gives
no
uneasiness
it
is
the
native
element
of
such
a
mind
which
is
symbolized
and
not
chafed
by
its
roundings
but
impurity
and
uncleanliness
which
do
not
trouble
the
gross
could
not
be
borne
by
the
refined
this
shows
that
the
mind
must
be
clean
to
keep
the
body
in
proper
condition
beliefs
illusive
the
eating
or
smoking
poison
for
half
a
century
sometimes
tells
you
that
the
weed
preserves
his
health
but
does
this
make
it
so
does
his
assertion
prove
the
use
of
tobacco
to
be
a
brious
habit
and
man
to
be
the
better
for
it
such
stances
only
prove
the
illusive
physical
effect
of
a
false
belief
confirming
the
scriptural
conclusion
concerning
a
man
as
he
thinketh
in
his
heart
so
is
he
the
pinching
and
pounding
the
poor
body
to
make
it
sensibly
well
when
it
ought
to
be
sensibly
so
is
another
medical
mistake
resulting
from
the
common
notion
that
health
depends
on
inert
matter
instead
of
on
mind
can
matter
or
what
is
termed
matter
either
feel
or
act
without
mind
corporeal
penalties
we
should
relieve
our
minds
from
the
depressing
thought
that
we
have
transgressed
a
material
law
and
must
of
necessity
pay
the
penalty
let
us
reassure
ourselves
with
the
law
of
love
god
never
punishes
man
for
doing
right
for
honest
labor
or
for
deeds
of
kindness
though
they
expose
him
to
fatigue
cold
heat
contagion
if
man
seems
to
incur
the
penalty
through
matter
this
is
but
a
belief
of
mortal
mind
not
an
enactment
of
wisdom
and
man
has
only
to
enter
his
protest
against
this
belief
in
order
to
annul
it
through
this
action
of
thought
and
its
results
upon
the
body
the
student
will
prove
to
himself
by
small
beginnings
the
grand
verities
of
christian
science
not
matter
but
mind
if
exposure
to
a
draught
of
air
while
in
a
state
of
perspiration
is
followed
by
chills
dry
cough
influenza
congestive
symptoms
in
the
lungs
or
hints
of
inflammatory
rheumatism
your
is
safe
and
sure
if
you
are
a
christian
scientist
such
symptoms
are
not
apt
to
follow
exposure
but
if
you
believe
in
laws
of
matter
and
their
fatal
effects
when
transgressed
you
are
not
fit
to
conduct
your
own
case
or
to
destroy
the
bad
effects
of
your
belief
when
the
fear
subsides
and
the
conviction
abides
that
you
have
broken
no
law
neither
rheumatism
consumption
nor
any
other
disease
will
ever
result
from
exposure
to
the
weather
in
science
this
is
an
established
fact
which
all
the
evidence
before
the
senses
can
never
overrule
benefit
of
philanthropy
sickness
sin
and
death
must
at
length
quail
before
the
divine
rights
of
intelligence
and
then
the
power
of
mind
over
the
entire
functions
and
organs
of
the
human
system
will
be
acknowledged
it
is
proverbial
that
florence
nightingale
and
other
philanthropists
gaged
in
humane
labors
have
been
able
to
undergo
without
sinking
fatigues
and
sures
which
ordinary
people
could
not
endure
the
planation
lies
in
the
support
which
they
derived
from
the
divine
law
rising
above
the
human
the
spiritual
demand
quelling
the
material
supplies
energy
and
durance
surpassing
all
other
aids
and
forestalls
the
penalty
which
our
beliefs
would
attach
to
our
best
deeds
let
us
remember
that
the
eternal
law
of
right
though
it
can
never
annul
the
law
which
makes
sin
its
own
executioner
exempts
man
from
all
penalties
but
those
due
for
honest
toil
has
no
penalty
constant
toil

all

our
sleep

you

that
you
have

you

unto
yourself
saying
this
and
believing
it
you
will
suffer
in
proportion
to
your
belief
and
fear
your
sufferings
are
not
the

for

of
mortal

one
of
its
dreams
realize
that
the
evidence
of
the
senses
is
not
to
be
accepted
in
the
case
of

any
more
than
it
is
in
the
case
of
sin
climate
and
belief
expose
the
body
to
certain
temperatures
and
belief
says
that
you
may
catch
cold
and
have
catarrh
but
no
such
result
occurs
without
mind
to
demand
it
and
produce
it
so
long
as
mortals
declare
that
certain
states
of
the
atmosphere
produce
catarrh
fever
rheumatism
or
consumption
those
effects
will
follow
not
because
of
the
climate
but
on
account
of
the
belief
the
author
has
in
too
many
instances
healed
disease
through
the
action
of
truth
on
the
minds
of
tals
and
the
corresponding
effects
of
truth
on
the
body
not
to
know
that
this
is
so
erroneous
despatch
a
blundering
despatch
mistakenly
announcing
the
death
of
a
friend
occasions
the
same
grief
that
the
real
death
would
bring
you
think
that
your
anguish
is
occasioned
by
your
loss
another
despatch
correcting
the
mistake
heals
your
grief
and
you
learn
that
your
suffering
was
merely
the
result
of
your
belief
thus
it
is
with
all
sorrow
sickness
and
death
you
will
learn
at
length
that
there
is
no
cause
for
grief
and
divine
wisdom
will
then
be
understood
error
not
truth
produces
all
the
suffering
on
earth
mourning
causeless
if
a
christian
scientist
had
said
while
you
were
ing
under
the
influence
of
the
belief
of
grief
your
row
is
without
cause
you
would
not
have
understood
him
although
the
correctness
of
the
assertion
might
afterwards
be
proved
to
you
so
when
our
friends
pass
from
our
sight
and
we
lament
that
lamentation
is
needless
and
causeless
we
shall
perceive
this
to
be
true
when
we
grow
into
the
standing
of
life
and
know
that
there
is
no
death
mind
heals
because
mortal
mind
is
kept
active
must
it
pay
the
penalty
in
a
softened
brain
who
dares
to
say
that
actual
mind
can
be
overworked
when
we
reach
our
limits
of
mental
endurance
we
conclude
that
intellectual
labor
has
been
carried
sufficiently
far
but
when
we
realize
that
immortal
mind
is
ever
active
and
that
spiritual
energies
can
neither
wear
out
nor
can
material
law
trespass
upon
powers
and
resources
we
are
able
to
rest
in
truth
refreshed
by
the
assurances
of
immortality
opposed
to
mortality
right
never
punishable
our
thinkers
do
not
die
early
because
they
faithfully
perform
the
natural
functions
of
being
if
printers
and
authors
have
the
shortest
span
of
earthly
istence
it
is
not
because
they
occupy
the
most
important
posts
and
perform
the
most
vital
functions
in
society
that
man
does
not
pay
the
severest
penalty
who
does
the
most
good
by
adhering
to
the
realities
of
eternal
existence
instead
of
reading
disquisitions
on
the
inconsistent
supposition
that
death
comes
in
obedience
to
the
law
of
life
and
that
god
punishes
man
for
doing
good
one
can
not
suffer
as
the
result
of
any
labor
of
love
but
grows
stronger
because
of
it
it
is
a
law
of
called
mortal
mind
misnamed
matter
which
causes
all
things
discordant
christian
history
the
history
of
christianity
furnishes
sublime
proofs
of
the
supporting
influence
and
protecting
power
bestowed
on
man
by
his
heavenly
father
omnipotent
mind
who
gives
man
faith
and
understanding
whereby
to
defend
himself
not
only
from
temptation
but
from
bodily
suffering
the
christian
martyrs
were
prophets
of
christian
science
through
the
uplifting
and
consecrating
power
of
divine
truth
they
obtained
a
victory
over
the
real
senses
a
victory
which
science
alone
can
explain
stolidity
which
is
a
resisting
state
of
mortal
mind
suffers
less
only
because
it
knows
less
of
material
law
the
apostle
john
testified
to
the
divine
basis
of
tian
science
when
dire
inflictions
failed
to
destroy
his
body
idolaters
believing
in
more
than
one
mind
had
gods
many
and
thought
that
they
could
kill
the
body
with
matter
independently
of
mind
sustenance
spiritual
admit
the
common
hypothesis
that
food
is
the
ment
of
life
and
the
follows
the
necessity
for
another
admission
in
the
opposite
direction
that
food
has
power
to
destroy
life
god
through
a
deficiency
or
an
excess
a
quality
or
a
quantity
this
is
a
specimen
of
the
ambiguous
nature
of
all
material
they
are
and
structive
constituting
a
kingdom
divided
against
itself
which
is
brought
to
desolation
if
food
was
prepared
by
jesus
for
his
disciples
it
can
not
destroy
life
god
sustains
man
the
fact
is
food
does
not
affect
the
absolute
life
of
man
and
this
becomes
when
we
learn
that
god
is
our
life
because
sin
and
sickness
are
not
qualities
of
soul
or
life
we
have
hope
in
immortality
but
it
would
be
foolish
to
venture
beyond
our
present
understanding
foolish
to
stop
eating
until
we
gain

a

spirit
in
that
perfect

of
understanding
we
shall
neither

to

nor
live
to
eat
diet
and
digestion
if
mortals
think
that
food
disturbs
the
harmonious
functions
of
mind
and
body
either
the
food
or
this
thought
must
be
dispensed
with
for
the
penalty
is
coupled
with
the
belief
which
shall
it
be
if
this
decision
be
left
to
christian
science
it
will
be
given
in

of
the
control

over
this

every
erroneous

or

the
less
we

the
less
we
are
predisposed
to
sickness
recollect
that
it
is
not
the
nerves
not
ter
but
mortal
mind
which
reports
food
as
undigested
matter
does
not
inform
you
of
bodily
derangements
it
is
supposed
to
do
so
this
testimony
can
be
destroyed
only
by
the
better

of

site
evidence
scripture
rebukes
our
dietetic
theories
first
admit
that
food
sustains
the
life
of
man
and
then
discuss
the
certainty
that
food
can
kill
man
this
false
reasoning
is
rebuked
in
scripture
by
the
metaphors
about
the
fount
and
stream
the
tree
and
its
fruit
and
the
kingdom
vided
against
itself
if
god
has
as
prevalent
theories
maintain
instituted
laws
that
food
shall
support
human
life
he
can
not
annul
these
regulations
by
an
opposite
law
that
food
shall
be
inimical
to
existence
ancient
confusion
materialists
contradict
their
own
statements
their
belief
in
material
laws
and
in
penalties
for
their
tion
is
the
ancient
error
that
there
is
fraternity
between
pain
and
pleasure
good
and
evil
god
and
satan
this
belief
totters
to
its
falling
before
the
of
science
a
case
of
convulsions
produced
by
indigestion
came
under
my
observation
in
her
belief
the
woman
had
chronic
and
was
then
suffering
from
a
complication
of
symptoms
connected
with
this
belief
i
cured
her
in
a
few
minutes
one
instant
she
spoke
spairingly
of
herself
the
next
minute
she
said
my
food
is
all
digested
and
i
should
like
something
more
to
eat
ultimate
harmony
we
can
not
deny
that
life
is
and
we
should
never
deny
the
everlasting
harmony
of
soul
ply
because
to
the
mortal
senses
there
is
ing
discord
it
is
our
ignorance
of
god
the
divine
principle
which
produces
apparent
discord
and
the
right
understanding
of
him
restores
harmony
truth
will
at
length
compel
us
all
to
exchange
the
pleasures
and
pains
of
sense
for
the
joys
of
soul
unnecessary
prostration
when
the
first
symptoms
of
disease
appear
dispute
the
testimony
of
the
material
senses
with
divine
science
let
your
higher
sense
of
justice
destroy
the
false
process
of
mortal
opinions
which
you
name
law
and
then
you
will
not
be
confined
to
a
nor
laid
upon
a
bed
of
suffering
in
payment
of
the
last
thing
the
last
penalty
demanded
by
error
agree
with
thine
adversary
quickly
whiles
thou
art
in
the
way
with
him
suffer
no
claim
of
sin
or
of
sickness
to
grow
upon
the
thought
dismiss
it
with
an
abiding
conviction
that
it
is
illegitimate
because
you
know
that
god
is
no
more
the
author
of
sickness
than
he
is
of
sin
you
have
no
law
of
his
to
support
the
necessity
either
of
sin
or
ness
but
you
have
divine
authority
for
denying
that
sity
and
healing
the
sick
treatment
of
disease
agree
to
disagree
with
approaching
symptoms
of
chronic
or
acute
disease
whether
it
is
cancer
tion
or
smallpox
meet
the
incipient
stages
of
disease
with
as
powerful
mental
tion
as
a
legislator
would
employ
to
defeat
the
passage
of
an
inhuman
law
rise
in
the
conscious
strength
of
the
spirit
of
truth
to
overthrow
the
plea
of
mortal
mind
matter
arrayed
against
the
supremacy
of
spirit
blot
out
the
images
of
mortal
thought
and
its
beliefs
in
sickness
and
sin
then
when
thou
art
delivered
to
the
judgment
of
truth
christ
the
judge
will
say
thou
art
whole
righteous
rebellion
instead
of
blind
and
calm
submission
to
the
incipient
or
advanced
stages
of
disease
rise
in
rebellion
against
them
banish
the
belief
that
you
can
bly
entertain
a
single
intruding
pain
which
not
be
ruled
out
by
the
might
of
mind
and
in
this
way
you
can
prevent
the
development
of
pain
in
the
body
no
law
of
god
hinders
this
result
it
is
error
to
suffer
for
aught
but
your
own
sins
christ
or
truth
will
stroy
all
other
supposed
suffering
and
real
suffering
for
your
own
sins
will
cease
in
proportion
as
the
sin
ceases
contradict
error
justice
is
the
moral
signification
of
law
injustice
clares
the
absence
of
law
when
the
body
is
supposed
to
say
i
am
sick
never
plead
guilty
since
matter
can
not
talk
it
must
be
mortal
mind
which
speaks
therefore
meet
the
intimation
with
a
test
if
you
say
i
am
sick
you
plead
guilty
then
your
adversary
will
deliver
you
to
the
judge
mortal
mind
and
the
judge
will
sentence
you
disease
has
no
intelligence
to
declare
itself
something
and
announce
its
name
mortal
mind
alone
sentences
itself
therefore
make
your
own
terms
with
sickness
and
be
just
to
yourself
and
to
others
sin
to
be
overcome
mentally
contradict
every
complaint
from
the
body
and
rise
to
the
true
consciousness
of
life
as
love
as
all
that
is
pure
and
bearing
the
fruits
of
spirit
fear
is
the
fountain
of
sickness
and
you
master
fear
and
sin
through
divine
mind
hence
it
is
through
divine
mind
that
you
overcome
disease
only
while
fear
or
sin
remains
can
it
bring
forth
death
to
cure
a
bodily
ailment
every
broken
moral
law
should
be
taken
into
account
and
the
error
be
rebuked
fear
which
is
an
element
of
all
disease
must
be
cast
out
to
readjust
the
balance
for
god
casting
out
evil
and
fear
enables
truth
to
outweigh
error
the
only
course
is
to
take
antagonistic
grounds
against
all
that
is
opposed
to
the
health
holiness
and
harmony
of
man
god
image
illusions
about
nerves
the
physical
affirmation
of
disease
should
always
be
met
with
the
mental
negation
whatever
benefit
is
duced
on
the
body
must
be
expressed
tally
and
thought
should
be
held
fast
to
this
ideal
if
you
believe
in
inflamed
and
weak
nerves
you
are
liable
to
an
attack
from
that
source
you
will
call
it
neuralgia
but
we
call
it
a
belief
if
you
think
that
sumption
is
hereditary
in
your
family
you
are
liable
to
the
development
of
that
thought
in
the
form
of
what
is
termed
pulmonary
disease
unless
science
shows
you
otherwise
if
you
decide
that
climate
or
atmosphere
is
unhealthy
it
will
be
so
to
you
your
decisions
will
ter
you
whichever
direction
they
take
guarding
the
door
reverse
the
case
stand
porter
at
the
door
of
thought
admitting
only
such
conclusions
as
you
wish
realized
in
bodily
results
you
will
control
yourself
moniously
when
the
condition
is
present
which
you
say
induces
disease
whether
it
be
air
exercise
heredity
contagion
or
accident
then
perform
your
office
as
porter
and
shut
out
these
unhealthy
thoughts
and
fears
exclude
from
mortal
mind
the
offending
errors
then
the
body
can
not
suffer
from
them
the
issues
of
pain
or
pleasure
must
come
through
mind
and
like
a
watchman
forsaking
his
post
we
admit
the
intruding
belief
ting
that
through
divine
help
we
can
forbid
this
entrance
the
strength
of
spirit
the
body
seems
to
be
only
because
mortal
mind
is
ignorant
of
itself
of
its
own
actions
and
of
their
results
ignorant
that
the
predisposing
mote
and
exciting
cause
of
all
bad
effects
is
a
law
of
mortal
mind
not
of
matter
mind
is
the
master
of
the
corporeal
senses
and
can
conquer
sickness
sin
and
death
exercise
this
authority
take
possession
of
your
body
and
govern
its
feeling
and
action
rise
in
the
strength
of
spirit
to
resist
all
that
is
unlike
good
god
has
made
man
capable
of
this
and
nothing
can
vitiate
the
ability
and
power
divinely
bestowed
on
man
no
pain
in
matter
be
firm
in
your
understanding
that
the
divine
mind
governs
and
that
in
science
man
reflects
god
ment
have
no
fear
that
matter
can
ache
swell
and
be
inflamed
as
the
result
of
a
law
of
any
kind
when
it
is
that
matter
can
have
no
pain
nor
inflammation
your
body
would
suffer
no
more
from
tension
or
wounds
than
the
trunk
of
a
tree
which
you
gash
or
the
electric
wire
which
you
stretch
were
it
not
for
mortal
mind
when
jesus
declares
that
the
light
of
the
body
is
the
eye
he
certainly
means
that
light
depends
upon
mind
not
upon
the
complex
humors
lenses
muscles
the
iris
and
pupil
constituting
the
visual
organism
no
real
disease
man
is
never
sick
for
mind
is
not
sick
and
matter
can
not
be
a
false
belief
is
both
the
tempter
and
the
tempted
the
sin
and
the
sinner
the
disease
and
its
cause
it
is
well
to
be
calm
in
sickness
to
be
hopeful
is
still
better
but
to
understand
that
ness
is
not
real
and
that
truth
can
destroy
its
seeming
reality
is
best
of
all
for
this
understanding
is
the
versal
and
perfect
remedy
recuperation
mental
by
conceding
power
to
discord
a
large
majority
of
doctors
depress
mental
energy
which
is
the
only
real
recuperative
power
knowledge
that
we
can
accomplish
the
good
we
hope
for
lates
the
system
to
act
in
the
direction
which
mind
points
out
the
admission
that
any
bodily
condition
is
beyond
the
control
of
mind
disarms
man
prevents
him
from
helping
himself
and
enthrones
matter
through
error
to
those
struggling
with
sickness
such
admissions
are
couraging
as
much
so
as
would
be
the
advice
to
a
man
who
is
down
in
the
world
that
he
should
not
try
to
rise
above
his
difficulties
experience
has
proved
to
the
author
the
fallacy
of
material
systems
in
general
that
their
theories
are
sometimes
pernicious
and
that
their
denials
are
better
than
their
affirmations
will
you
bid
a
man
let
evils
overcome
him
assuring
him
that
all
misfortunes
are
from
god
against
whom
mortals
should
not
contend
will
you
tell
the
sick
that
their
condition
is
hopeless
unless
it
can
be
aided
by
a
drug
or
climate
are
material
means
the
only
refuge
from
fatal
chances
is
there
no
divine
permission
to
conquer
discord
of
every
kind
with
harmony
with
truth
and
love
arguing
wrongly
we
should
remember
that
life
is
god
and
that
god
is
omnipotent
not
understanding
christian
science
the
sick
usually
have
little
faith
in
it
till
they
feel
its
beneficent
influence
this
shows
that
faith
is
not
the
healer
in
such
cases
the
sick
unconsciously
argue
for
suffering
instead
of
against
it
they
admit
its
reality
whereas
they
should
deny
it
they
should
plead
in
opposition
to
the
testimony
of
the
deceitful
senses
and
maintain
man
immortality
and
eternal
likeness
to
god
divine
authority
like
the
great
exemplar
the
healer
should
speak
to
disease
as
one
having
authority
over
it
leaving
soul
to
master
the
false
evidences
of
the
corporeal
senses
and
to
assert
its
claims
over
ity
and
disease
the
same
principle
cures
both
sin
and
sickness
when
divine
science
overcomes
faith
in
a
nal
mind
and
faith
in
god
destroys
all
faith
in
sin
and
in
material
methods
of
healing
then
sin
disease
and
death
will
disappear
aids
in

prayers
in
which
god
is
not
asked
to
heal
but
is
sought
to
take
the
patient
to
himself
do
not
benefit
the
sick
an
complaining
or

not

the

should
be
cheerful

full
of

mental
quackery
it
is
mental
quackery
to
make
disease
a
reality
to
hold
it
as
something
seen
and
felt
and
then
to
attempt
its
cure
through
mind
it
is
no
less
erroneous
to
believe
in
the
real
existence
of
a
tumor
a
cancer
or
decayed
lungs
while
you
argue
against
their
reality
than
it
is
for
your
patient
to
feel
these
ills
in
physical
belief
mental
practice
which
holds
disease
as
a
reality
fastens
disease
on
the
patient
and
it
may
appear
in
a
more
alarming
form
effacing
images
of
disease
the
knowledge
that
can
not
kill
a
man
nor
affect
the
functions
of
mind
would
prevent
the
brain
from
becoming
diseased
though
a
moral
offence
is
indeed
the
worst
of
diseases
one
should
never
hold
in
mind
the
thought
of
disease
but
should
efface
from
thought
all
forms
and
types
of
disease
both
for
one
own
sake
and
for
that
of
the
patient
avoid
talking
disease
avoid
talking
illness
to
the
patient
make
no
cessary
inquiries
relative
to
feelings
or
disease
never
startle
with
a
discouraging
remark
about
covery
nor
draw
attention
to
certain
toms
as
unfavorable
avoid
speaking
aloud
the
name
of
the
disease
never
say
beforehand
how
much
you
have
to
contend
with
in
a
case
nor
encourage
in
the
thought
the
expectation
of
growing
worse
before
a
crisis
is
passed
false
testimony
refuted
the
refutation
of
the
testimony
of
material
sense
is
not
a
difficult
task
in
view
of
the
conceded
falsity
of
this
testimony
the
refutation
becomes
arduous
not
because
the
testimony
of
sin
or
disease
is
true
but
solely
on
account
of
the
tenacity
of
belief
in
its
truth
due
to
the
force
of
education
and
the
ing
weight
of
opinions
on
the
wrong
side
all
teaching
that
the
body
suffers
as
if

could
have
sensation
healthful
explanation
at
the
right
time
explain
to
the
sick
the
power
which
their
beliefs
exercise
over
their
bodies
give
them
divine
and
wholesome
understanding
with
which
to
combat
their
erroneous
sense
and
so
efface
the
images
of
sickness
from
mortal
mind
keep
distinctly
in
thought
that
man
is
the
offspring
of
god
not
of
man
that
man
is
spiritual
not
material
that
soul
is
spirit
outside
of
matter
never
in
it
never
giving
the
body
life
and
sensation
it
breaks
the
dream
of
disease
to
stand
that
sickness
is
formed
by
the
human
mind
not
by
matter
nor
by
the
divine
mind
misleading
methods
by
not
perceiving
vital
metaphysical
points
not
seeing
how
mortal
mind
affects
the
body
acting
beneficially
or
injuriously
on
the
health
as
well
as
on
the
morals
and
the
happiness
of
mortals
we
are
misled
in
our
conclusions
and
methods
we
throw
the
mental
influence
on
the
wrong
side
thereby
actually
juring
those
whom
we
mean
to
bless
remedy
for
accidents
suffering
is
no
less
a
mental
condition
than
is
ment
you
cause
bodily
sufferings
and
increase
them
by
admitting
their
reality
and
continuance
as
directly
as
you
enhance
your
joys
by
lieving
them
to
be
real
and
continuous
when
an
cident
happens
you
think
or
exclaim
i
am
hurt
your
thought
is
more
powerful
than
your
words
more
powerful
than
the
accident
itself
to
make
the
injury
real
now
reverse
the
process
declare
that
you
are
not
hurt
and
understand
the
reason
why
and
you
will
find
the
ensuing
good
effects
to
be
in
exact
proportion
to
your
disbelief
in
physics
and
your
fidelity
to
divine
physics
confidence
in
god
as
all
which
the
scriptures
declare
him
to
be
independent
mentality
to
heal
the
sick
one
must
be
familiar
with
the
great
verities
of
being
mortals
are
no
more
material
in
their
waking
hours
than
when
they
act
walk
see
hear
enjoy
or
suffer
in
dreams
we
can
never
treat
mortal
mind
and
matter
separately
because
they
combine
as
one
give
up
the
belief
that
mind
is
even
temporarily
compressed
within
the
skull
and
you
will
quickly
become
more
manly
or
womanly
you
will
understand
yourself
and
your
maker
better
than
before
naming
maladies
sometimes
jesus
called
a
disease
by
name
as
when
he
said
to
the
epileptic
boy
thou
dumb
and
deaf
spirit
i
charge
thee
come
out
of
him
and
enter
no
more
into
him
it
is
added
that
the
spirit
error
cried
and
rent
him
sore
and
came
out
of
him
and
he
was
as
one
dead
clear
evidence
that
the
malady
was
not
material
these
instances
show
the
concessions
which
jesus
was

homoeopathic
remedies
sometimes
not
containing
a
particle
of

are
known
to
relieve
the
symptoms
of
disease
what
produces
the
change
it
is
the
faith
of
the
doctor
and
the
patient
which
reduces
sufferings
and
produces
a
new
effect
upon

in

in

and
the
desire
for

and
disease
reside
in
mortal

not
in
matter
so
also
faith
cooperating
with
a
belief
in
the
healing
effects
of
time
and
medication
will
soothe
fear
and
change
the
belief
of
disease
to
a
belief
of
health
even
a
blind
faith
removes
bodily
ailments
for
a
season
but
hypnotism
changes
such
ills
into
new
and
more
difficult
forms
of
ease
the
science
of
mind
must
come
to
the
rescue
to
work
a
radical
cure
then
we
understand
the
process
the
great
fact
remains
that
evil
is
not
mind
evil
has
no
power
no
intelligence
for
god
is
good
and
therefore
good
is
infinite
is
all
corporeal
combinations
you
say
that
certain
material
combinations
produce
disease
but
if
the
material
body
causes
disease
can
matter
cure
what
matter
has
caused
mortal
mind
prescribes
the
drug
and
administers
it
mortal
mind
plans
the
exercise
and
puts
the
body
through
certain
motions
no
gastric
gas
accumulates
not
a
cretion
nor
combination
can
operate
apart
from
the
action
of
mortal
thought
mind
automatic
mechanism
mortal
mind
sends
its
despatches
over
its
body
but
this
mind
is
both
the
service
and
message
of
this
telegraphy
nerves
are
able
to
talk
and
matter
can
return
no
swer
to
immortal
mind
if
mind
is
the
only
actor
how
can
mechanism
be
automatic
mortal
mind
perpetuates
its
own
thought
it
constructs
a
machine
manages
it
and
then
calls
it
material
a
mill
at
work
or
the
action
of
a
is
but
a
derivative
from
and
tion
of
the
primitive
mortal
mind
without
this
force
the
body
is
devoid
of
action
and
this
deadness
shows
that
mortal
life
is
mortal
mind
not
matter
mental
strength
scientifically
speaking
there
is
no
mortal
mind
out
of
which
to
make
material
beliefs
springing
from
illusion
this
misnamed
mind
is
not
an
entity
it
is
only
a
false
sense
of
matter
since
matter
is
not
sensible
the
one
mind
god
contains
no
mortal
ions
all
that
is
real
is
included
in
this
immortal
mind
confirmation
in
a
parable
our
master
asked
how
can
one
enter
into
a
strong
man
house
and
spoil
his
goods
except
he
first
bind
the
strong
man
in
other
words
how
can
i
heal
the
body
without
beginning
with
mortal
mind
which
directly
controls
the
body
when
disease
is
once
destroyed
in
this
mind
the
fear
of
disease
is
gone
and
therefore
the
disease
is
oughly
cured
mortal
mind
is
the
strong
man
which
must
be
held
in
subjection
before
its
influence
upon
health
and
morals
can
be
removed
this
error
conquered
we
can
despoil
the
strong
man
of
his
goods
namely
of
sin
and
disease
eradicate
error
from
thought
mortals
obtain
the
harmony
of
health
only
as
they
forsake
discord
acknowledge
the
supremacy
of
divine
mind
and
abandon
their
material
beliefs
eradicate
the
image
of
disease
from
the
turbed
thought
before
it
has
taken
tangible
shape
in
conscious
thought
the
body
and
you
vent
the
development
of
disease
this
task
becomes
easy
if
you
understand
that
every
disease
is
an
error
and
has
no
character
nor
type
except
what
mortal
mind
assigns
to
it
by
lifting
thought
above
error
or
disease
and
tending
persistently
for
truth
you
destroy
error
mortal
mind
controlled
when
we
remove
disease
by
addressing
the
disturbed
mind
giving
no
heed
to
the
body
we
prove
that
thought
alone
creates
the
suffering
mortal
mind
rules
all
that
is
mortal
we
see
in
the
body
the
images
of
this
mind
even
as
in
optics
we
see
painted
on
the
retina
the
image
which
becomes
visible
to
the
senses
the
action
of
mortal
mind
must
be
destroyed
by
the
divine
mind
to
bring
out
the
harmony
of
being
without
divine
control
there
is
discord
fest
as
sin
sickness
and
death
mortal
mind
not
a
healer
the
scriptures
plainly
declare
the
baneful
influence
of
sinful
thought
on
the
body
even
our
master
felt
this
it
is
recorded
that
in
certain
localities
he
did
not
many
mighty
works
because
of
their
unbelief
in
truth
any
human
error
is
its
own
enemy
and
works
against
itself
it
does
nothing
in
the
right
direction
and
much
in
the
wrong
if
mind
is
cherishing
evil
passions
and
malicious
purposes
it
is
not
a
healer
but
it
engenders
disease
and
death
effect
of
opposites
if
faith
in
the
truth
of
being
which
you
impart
tally
while
destroying
error
causes
chemicalization
as
when
an
alkali
is
destroying
an
acid
it
is
cause
the
truth
of
being
must
transform
the
error
to
the
end
of
producing
a
higher
manifestation
this
fermentation
should
not
aggravate
the
disease
but
should
be
as
painless
to
man
as
to
a
fluid
since
matter
has
no
sensation
and
mortal
mind
only
feels
and
sees
materially
what
i
term
is
the
upheaval
produced
when
immortal
truth
is
destroying
erroneous
mortal
lief
mental
chemicalization
brings
sin
and
sickness
to
the
surface
forcing
impurities
to
pass
away
as
is
the
case
with
a
fermenting
fluid
medicine
and
brain
the
only
effect
produced
by
medicine
is
dependent
upon
mental
action
if
the
mind
were
parted
from
the
body
could
you
produce
any
effect
upon
the
brain
or
body
by
applying
the
drug
to
either
would
the
drug
remove
paralysis
affect

or
restore

and
action
to
cerebrum
and
cerebellum
skilful
surgery
until
the
advancing
age
admits
the
efficacy
and
acy
of
mind
it
is
better
for
christian
scientists
to
leave
surgery
and
the
adjustment
of
broken
bones
and
dislocations
to
the
fingers
of
a
surgeon
while
the
mental
healer
confines
himself
chiefly
to
mental
reconstruction
and
to
the
prevention
of
inflammation
christian
science
is
always
the
most
skilful
surgeon
but
surgery
is
the
branch
of
its
healing
which
will
be
last
acknowledged
however
it
is
but
just
to
say
that
the
author
has
already
in
her
possession
records
of
the
cure
by
herself
and
her
students
through
mental
surgery
alone
of
broken
bones
dislocated
joints
and
spinal
vertebrae
indestructible
life
of
man
the
time
approaches
when
mortal
mind
will
forsake
its
corporeal
structural
and
material
basis
when
mortal
mind
and
its
formations
will
be
hended
in
science
and
material
beliefs
will
not
interfere
with
spiritual
facts
man
is
indestructible
and
eternal
sometime
it
will
be
learned
that
mortal
mind
constructs
the
mortal
body
with
this
mind
own
mortal
materials
in
science
no
breakage
nor
dislocation
can
really
occur
you
say
that
accidents
injuries
and
disease
kill
man
but
this
is
not
true
the
life
of
man
is
mind
the
material
body
manifests
only
what
mortal
mind
believes
whether
it
be
a
broken
bone
disease
or
sin
the
evil
of
mesmerism
we
say
that
one
human
mind
can
influence
another
and
in
this
way
affect
the
body
but
we
rarely
remember
that
we
govern
our
own
bodies
the
error
merism
or
hypnotism
to
use
the
recent
term
illustrates
the
fact
just
stated
the
operator
would
make
his
subjects
believe
that
they
can
not
act
voluntarily
and
handle
themselves
as
they
should
do
if
they
yield
to
this
influence
it
is
because
their
belief
is
not
better
instructed
by
spiritual
understanding
hence
the
proof
that
hypnotism
is
not
scientific
science
can
not
produce
both
disorder
and
order
the
involuntary
pleasure
or
pain
of
the
person
under
hypnotic
control
is
proved
to
be
a
belief
without
a
real
cause
should
suffer
so
the
sick
through
their
beliefs
have
induced
their
own
diseased
conditions
the
great
difference
between
untary
and
involuntary
mesmerism
is
that
untary
mesmerism
is
induced
consciously
and
should
and
does
cause
the
perpetrator
to
suffer
while
mesmerism
is
induced
unconsciously
and
by
his
mistake
a
man
is
often
instructed
in
the
first
instance
it
is
stood
that
the
difficulty
is
a
mental
illusion
while
in
the
second
it
is
believed
that
the
misfortune
is
a
material
effect
the
human
mind
is
employed
to
remove
the
illusion
in
one
case
but
matter
is
appealed
to
in
the
other
in
ity
both
have
their
origin
in
the
human
mind
and
can
be
healed
only
by
the
divine
mind
error

imaginary
you
command
the
situation
if
you
understand
that
mortal
existence
is
a

not
the
truth

mortal
mind
is
constantly
producing
on
mortal
body
the
results
of
false
opinions
and
it
will
continue
to
do
so
until
mortal
error
is
deprived
of
its
imaginary
powers
by
truth
which
sweeps
away
the
gossamer
web
of
mortal
illusion
the
most
christian
state
is
one
of
rectitude
and
itual
understanding
and
this
is
best
adapted
for
ing
the
sick
never
conjure
up
some
new
discovery
from
dark
forebodings
regarding
disease
and
then
acquaint
your
patient
with
it
the
mortal
mind
produces
all
that
is
unlike
the
immortal
mind
the
human
mind
determines
the
nature
of
a
case
and
the
practitioner
improves
or
injures
the
case
in
proportion
to
the
truth
or
error
which
influences
his
conclusions
the
mental
conception
and
development
of
disease
are
not
stood
by
the
patient
but
the
physician
should
be
familiar
with
mental
action
and
its
effect
in
order
to
judge
the
case
according
to
christian
science
appetites

a

the
special
servant

any
one
of
the
myriad
forms
of
sin
meet
and
destroy
these
errors
with
the
truth
of
being
by
exhibiting
to
the
the
suffering
which
his
submission
to
such
habits
brings
and
by
vincing
him
that
there
is
no
real
pleasure
in
false
tites
a
corrupt
mind
is
manifested
in
a
corrupt
body
lust
malice
and
all
sorts
of
evil
are
diseased
beliefs
and
you
can
destroy
them
only
by
destroying
the
wicked
motives
which
produce
them
if
the
evil
is
over
in
the
repentant
mortal
mind
while
its
effects
still
remain
on
the
individual
you
can
remove
this
disorder
as

the

reform

all
over

from

cuts
down
every
tree
that

not
forth
good
fruit
this
viction
that
there
is
no
real
pleasure
in
sin
is
one
of
the
most
important
points
in
the
theology
of
christian
science
arouse
the
sinner
to
this
new
and
true
view
of
sin
show
him
that
sin
confers
no
pleasure
and
this
knowledge
strengthens
his
moral
courage
and
increases
his
ability
to
master
evil
and
to
love
good
sin
or
fear
the
root
of
sickness
healing
the
sick
and
reforming
the
sinner
are
one
and
the
same
thing
in
christian
science
both
cures
require
the
same
method
and
are
inseparable
in

hatred

and
so
forth
make
a
man
sick

neither

can
help
him
permanently
even
in

unless
it
makes
him
better
mentally
and
so
delivers
him
from
his
destroyers
the
basic
error
is
mortal

hatred
inflames
the
brutal
propensities
the
indulgence
of
evil
motives
and
aims
makes
any
man
who
is
above
the
lowest
type
of
manhood
a
hopeless

christian

commands
man
to
master
the
pensities
to
hold

in
abeyance
with

to
conquer

with

with

these
errors
in

early
stages
if
you
would
not
cherish
an
army
of
conspirators

they
will
deliver
you
to
the
judge
the

the

will
deliver
you
to
justice
and
the
sentence
of
the

will
be
executed
upon

will
be
manacled

if

for
all

the

the

into

sin
a
form
of
insanity
there
are
many
species
of
insanity
all
sin
is
ity
in
different
degrees
sin
is
spared
from
this
classification
only
because
its
method
of
madness
is
in
consonance
with
common
mortal
belief
every
sort
of
sickness
is
error
that
is
sickness
is
loss
of
harmony
this
view
is
not
altered
by
the
fact
that
sin
is
worse
than
sickness
and
sickness
is
not
knowledged
nor
discovered
to
be
error
by
many
who
are
sick
there
is
a
universal
insanity
of
health
which
mistakes
fable
for
fact
throughout
the
entire
round
of
the
material
senses
but
this
general
craze
can
not
in
a
tific
diagnosis
shield
the
individual
case
from
the
special
name
of
insanity
those
unfortunate
people
who
are
committed
to
insane
asylums
are
only
so
many
distinctly
defined
instances
of
the
baneful
effects
of
illusion
on
tal
minds
and
bodies
drugs
and
the
supposition
that
we
can
correct
insanity
by
the
use
of
purgatives
and
narcotics
is
in
itself
a
mild
species
of
insanity
can
drugs
go
of
their
own
accord
to
the
brain
and
destroy
the
mation
of
disordered
functions
thus
reaching
mortal
mind
through
matter
drugs
do
not
affect
a
corpse
and
truth
does
not
distribute
drugs
through
the
blood
and
from
them
derive
a
supposed
effect
on
intelligence
and
timent
a
dislocation
of
the
tarsal
joint
would
produce
insanity
as
perceptibly
as
would
congestion
of
the
brain
were
it
not
that
mortal
mind
thinks
that
the
tarsal
joint
is
less
intimately
connected
with
the
mind
than
is
the
brain
reverse
the
belief
and
the
results
would
be
perceptibly
different
matter
and
animate
error
the
unconscious
thought
in
the
corporeal
tum
of
brain
produces
no
effect
and
that
condition
of
the
body
which
we
call
sensation
in

is
unreal
mortal
mind
is
ignorant
of

ignorant
of
the
errors
it

and
of
their

intelligent

is
an
impossibility
you
may
say
but
if

why
do
you
insist
that

is
formed
by

belief

the

termed
the

suffers
and
reports
disease
independently
of
this

is
the
error
which
prevents
mortals
from
knowing

the

the

but
the
mortal

of

are
counterfeits
from

for
the
pure
reality
this
mortal

put
off
and
the
new

man
is
put
on
in

as
mortals
realize
the
science
of
man
and
seek
the
true
model
death
no
benefactor
we
have
no
right
to
say
that
life
depends
on
matter
now
but
will
not
depend
on
it
after
death
we
can
not
spend
our
days
here
in
ignorance
of
the
science
of
life
and
expect
to
find
beyond
the
grave
a
reward
for
this
ignorance
death
will
not
make
us
harmonious
and
immortal
as
a
recompense
for
ignorance
if
here
we
give
no
heed
to
christian
science
which
is
spiritual

eternal
we
shall
not
be
ready
for
spiritual
life
hereafter
life
eternal
and
present
this
is
life
eternal
says
jesus
not
and
then
he
defines
everlasting
life
as
a
present
knowledge
of
his
father
and
of
himself
the
knowledge
of
love
truth
and

this
is
life
nal
that
they
might
know
thee
the
only
true
god
and
jesus
christ
whom
thou
hast
sent
the
scriptures
say
man
shall
not
live
by
bread
but
by
every
word
that
proceedeth
out
of
the
mouth
of
god
ing
that
truth
is
the

of
man
but
mankind
objects
to
making
this
teaching

every
trial
of
our
faith

makes
us
stronger
the
more
difficult
seems
the
material
condition
to
be
overcome
by
spirit
the
stronger
should
be
our
faith
and
the
purer
our
love
the
apostle
john
says
there
is
no
fear
in
love
but
perfect
love
casteth
out

he
that

is
not

here
is
a

the

no

not

to

be
not

said
job
the
thing
which
i
greatly
feared
is
come
upon
me
naming
diseases
my
first
discovery
in
the
student
practice
was
this
if
the
student
silently
called
the
disease
by
name
when
he
argued
against
it
as
a
general
rule
the
body
would
respond
more
quickly
just
as
a
son
replies
more
readily
when
his
name
is
spoken
but
this
was
because
the
student
was
not
perfectly
attuned
to
divine
science
and
needed
the
arguments
of
truth
for
reminders
if
spirit
or
the
power
of
divine
love
bear
witness
to
the
truth
this
is
the
ultimatum
the
scientific
way
and
the
healing
is
instantaneous
evils
cast
out
it
is
recorded
that
once
jesus
asked
the
name
of
a
ease
a
disease
which
moderns
would
call
the
demon
or
evil
replied
that
his
name
was
legion
thereupon
jesus
cast
out
the
evil
and
the
insane
man
was
changed
and
straightway
came
whole
the
scripture
seems
to
import
that
jesus
caused
the
evil
to
be
and
so
destroyed
fear
as
the
foundation
the
procuring
cause
and
foundation
of
all
sickness
is
fear
ignorance
or
sin
disease
is
always
induced
by
a
false
sense
mentally
entertained

destroyed
disease
is
an
image

the

your

allaying
the

watch
the

of
this
simple
rule

you
will
find
that
it
alleviates
the

you
succeed

the
great
fact
that
god
lovingly
governs

never

you
may
call

you
mentally

by

you
are

under
some
circumstances
to
impress
it
upon
the
thought
the
power
of
christian

is
omnipotent
it

the
daily

are
no

nor

than
would
be
the
process
of
taking

every

and
covering
it
with

in
order
to
make
it
thrive
more

cleanliness

in

all

with
illusions
about

these

convey

the

the
ments
to
be
used
in

are
the

as
in

namely
the

that

lest
you

the

against
their
own
interests
by

and
perplexing
their

the
christian

argument
rests
on
the
christianly
scientific

of

the

the

inflamation

which

is
why

relieve

they
quiet
the

by

by

etherization

apparently
cause

before

the

vanish
from

indeed
the

this

not
be
sick
that
what
is
termed
matter
can
not
be
sick
that
all
causation
is

acting
through
spiritual
law
then
hold
your
ground
with
the
unshaken
understanding
of
truth
and
love
and
you
will
win
when
you
silence
the
witness
against
your
plea
you
destroy
the
evidence
for
the
disease
pears
the
evidence
before
the
corporeal
senses
is
not
the

of

disease
to
be
made
unreal
to
the
christian
science
healer
sickness
is
a
dream
from
which
the
patient
needs
to
be
awakened
ease
should
not
appear
real
to
the
physician
since
it
is
demonstrable
that
the
way
to
cure
the
patient
is
to
make
disease
unreal
to
him
to
do
this
the
physician
must
understand
the
unreality
of
disease
in
science
explain
audibly
to
your
patients
as
soon
as
they
can
bear
it
the
complete
control
which
mind
holds
over
the
body
show
them
how
mortal
mind
seems
to
induce
disease
by
certain
fears
and
false
conclusions
and
how
divine
mind
can
cure
by
opposite
thoughts
give
your
patients
an
underlying
understanding
to
support
them
and
to
shield
them
from
the
baneful
effects
of
their
own
conclusions
show
them
that
the
conquest
over
sickness
as
well
as
over
sin
depends
on
mentally
destroying
all
belief
in

pleasure
or

christian

plead
with
an
honest
conviction
of

and
a

perception
of
the

then
if
your

is
half
equal
to
the
truth
of
your

you
will
heal
the

truthful

it
must
be
clear
to
you
that
sickness
is
no
more
the
reality
of
being
than
is
sin
this
mortal
dream
of
sickness
sin
and

should
cease
through
christian

then
one
ease
would
be
as
readily
destroyed
as
another
ever
the
belief

if
arguments
are
used
to
destroy
it
the

the

to
whatever

all

if

they
should

call
an

christian
scientist
to
aid
them
if
they
are
unwilling
to
do
this
for
themselves
they
need
only
to
know
that

can
not
produce
this
unnatural
reluctance
positive
reassurance
instruct
the

that
they
are
not

victims
for
if
they
will
only
accept
truth
they
can
resist
disease
and
ward
it
off
as
positively
as
they
can
the
temptation
to
sin
this
fact
of
christian
ence
should
be
explained
to
invalids
when
they
are
in
a
fit
mood
to
receive
it
when
they
will
not
array
selves
against
it
but
are
ready
to
become
receptive
to
the
new
idea
the
fact
that
truth
overcomes
both
disease
and
sin
reassures
depressed
hope
it
imparts
a
healthy
stimulus
to
the
body
and
regulates
the
system
it
creases
or
diminishes

action
as
the
case
may
require
better
than
any
drug
alterative
or
tonic
proper
stimulus
mind
is
the
natural
stimulus
of
the
body
but
neous
belief
taken
at
its
best
is
not
promotive
of
health
or
happiness
tell
the
sick
that
they
can
meet
disease
fearlessly
if
they
only
realize
that
divine
love
gives
them
all
power
over
every
physical
action
and
condition
awaken
the
patient
if
it
becomes
necessary
to
startle
mortal
mind
to
break
its
dream
of
suffering
vehemently
tell
your
patient
that
he
must
awake
turn
his
gaze
from
the
false
evidence
of
the
senses
to
the
harmonious
facts
of
soul
and
immortal
being
tell
him
that
he
suffers
only
as
the
insane
suffer
from
false
beliefs
the
only
difference
is
that
insanity
implies
belief
in
a
diseased
brain
while
physical
ailments
arise
from
the
belief
that
other
portions
of
the
body
are
deranged
rangement
or
is
a
word
which
conveys
the
true
definition
of
all
human
belief
in
or
turbed
harmony
should
you
thus
startle
mortal
mind
in
order
to
remove
its
beliefs
afterwards
make
known
to
the
patient
your
motive
for
this
shock
showing
him
that
it
was
to
facilitate
recovery
how
to
treat
a
crisis
if
a
crisis
occurs
in
your
treatment
you
must
treat
the
patient
less
for
the
disease
and
more
for
the
mental
disturbance
or
fermentation
and
subdue
the
symptoms
by
removing
the
belief
that
this
chemicalization
produces
pain
or
disease
insist
mently
on
the
great
fact
which
covers
the
whole
ground
that
god
spirit
is
all
and
that
there
is
none
beside
him
there
is
when
the
supposed
ing
is
gone
from
mortal
mind
there
can
be
no
pain
and
when
the
fear
is
destroyed
the
inflammation
will
side
calm
the
excitement
sometimes
induced
by
calization
which
is
the
alterative
effect
produced
by
truth
upon
error
and
sometimes
explain
the
symptoms
and
their
cause
to
the
patient
no
perversion
of
it
is
no
more
christianly
scientific
to
see
disease
than
it
is
to
experience
it
if
you
would
destroy
the
sense
of
disease
you
should
not
build
it
up
by
wishing
to
see
the
forms
it
assumes
or
by
employing
a
single
material
application
for
its
relief
the
perversion
of
is
like
serting
that
the
products
of
eight
multiplied
by
five
and
of
seven
by
ten
are
both
forty
and
that
their
combined
sum
is
fifty
and
then
calling
the
process
mathematics
wiser
than
his
persecutors
jesus
said
if
i
by
bub
cast
out
devils
by
whom
do
your
children
cast
them
out
effect
of
this
book
if
the
reader
of
this
book
observes
a
great
stir
out
his
whole
system
and
certain
moral
and
physical
symptoms
seem
aggravated
these
indications
are
favorable
continue
to
read
and
the
book
will
become
the
physician
allaying
the
tremor
which
truth
often
brings
to
error
when
destroying
it
disease
neutralized
patients
unfamiliar
with
the
cause
of
this
commotion
and
ignorant
that
it
is
a
favorable
omen
may
be
alarmed
if
such
be
the
case
explain
to
them
the
law
of
this
action
as
when
an
acid
and
alkali
meet
and
bring
out
a
third
quality
so
mental
and
moral
chemistry
changes
the
material
base
of
thought
giving
more
spirituality
to
consciousness
and
causing
it
to
depend
less
on
material
evidence
these
changes
which
go
on
in
mortal
mind
serve
to
reconstruct
the
body
thus
christian
science
by
the
alchemy
of
spirit
destroys
sin
and
death
by
surgery
let
us
suppose
two
parallel
cases
of
both
similarly
produced
and
attended
by
the
same
symptoms
a
surgeon
is
employed
in
one
case
and
a
christian
scientist
in
the
other
the
geon
holding
that
matter
forms
its
own
conditions
and
renders
them
fatal
at
certain
points
entertains
fears
and
doubts
as
to
the
ultimate
outcome
of
the
injury
not
holding
the
reins
of
government
in
his
own
hands
he
believes
that
something
stronger
than
mind
namely
matter
governs
the
case
his
treatment
is
therefore
tentative
this
mental
state
invites
defeat
the
belief
that
he
has
met
his
master
in
matter
and
may
not
be
able
to
mend
the
bone
increases
his
fear
yet
this
belief
should
not
be
communicated
to
the
patient
either
bally
or
otherwise
for
this
fear
greatly
diminishes
the
tendency
towards
a
favorable
result
remember
that
the
unexpressed
belief
oftentimes
affects
a
sensitive
patient
more
strongly
than
the
expressed
thought
scientific
corrective
the
christian
scientist
understanding
scientifically
that
all
is
mind
commences
with
mental
causation
the
truth
of
being
to
destroy
the
error
this
rective
is
an
alterative
reaching
to
every
part
of
the
human
system
according
to
scripture
it
searches
the
joints
and
marrow
and
it
restores
the
harmony
of
man
coping
with
difficulties
the
deals
with
matter
as
both
his
foe
and
his
remedy
he
regards
the
ailment
as
weakened
or
strengthened
according
to
the
evidence
which
matter
presents
the
metaphysician
making
mind
his
basis
of
operation
irrespective
of
matter
and
regarding
the
truth
and
harmony
of
being
as
superior
to
error
and
discord
has
rendered
himself
strong
instead
of
weak
to
cope
with
the
case
and
he
proportionately
strengthens
his
patient
with
the
stimulus
of
courage
and
conscious
power
both
science
and
consciousness
are
now
at
work
in
the
economy
of
being
according
to
the
law
of
mind
which
ultimately
asserts
its
absolute
supremacy
formation
from
thought
ossification
or
any
abnormal
condition
or
ment
of
the
body
is
as
directly
the
action
of
mortal
mind
as
is
dementia
or
insanity
bones
have
only
the
substance
of
thought
which
forms
them
they
are
only
phenomena
of
the
mind
of
tals
the
substance
of
bone
is
formed
first
by
the
parent
mind
through
soon
the
child
becomes
a
separate
individualized
mortal
mind
which
takes
possession
of
itself
and
its
own
thoughts
of
bones
accidents
unknown
to
god
accidents
are
unknown
to
god
or
immortal
mind
and
we
must
leave
the
mortal
basis
of
belief
and
unite
with
the
one
mind
in
order
to
change
the
notion
of
chance
to
the
proper
sense
of
god
unerring
direction
and
thus
bring
out
harmony
opposing
mentality
under
divine
providence
there
can
be
no
accidents
since
there
is
no
room
for
imperfection
in
perfection
in
medical
practice
objections
would
be
raised
if
one
doctor
should
administer
a
drug
to
counteract
the
ing
of
a
remedy
prescribed
by
another
doctor
it
is
equally
important
in
metaphysical
tice
that
the
surround
your
patient
should
not
act
against
your
influence
by
continually
expressing
such
opinions
as
may
alarm
or
discourage
either
by
giving
antagonistic
advice
or
through
unspoken
thoughts
resting
on
your
patient
while
it
is
certain
that
the
divine
mind
can
remove
any
obstacle
still
you
need
the
ear
of
your
auditor
it
is
not
more
difficult
to
make
self
heard
mentally
while
others
are
thinking
about
your
patients
or
conversing
with
them
if
you
understand
christian
science
the
oneness
and
the
allness
of
divine
love
but
it
is
well
to
be
alone
with
god
and
the
sick
when
treating
disease
mind
removes
scrofula
to
prevent
or
to
cure
scrofula
and
other
reditary
diseases
you
must
destroy
the
belief
in
these
ills
and
the
faith
in
the
possibility
of
their
mission
the
patient
may
tell
you
that
he
has
a
humor
in
the
blood
a
scrofulous
diathesis
his
parents
or
some
of
his
progenitors
farther
back
have
so
believed
mortal
mind
not
matter
induces
this
clusion
and
its
results
you
will
have
humors
just
so
long
as
you
believe
them
to
be
or
to
be
ineradicable
nothing
to
consume
if
the
case
to
be
mentally
treated
is
consumption
take
up
the
leading
points
included
according
to
belief
in
this
disease
show
that
it
is
not
inherited
that
inflammation
tubercles
hemorrhage
and
decomposition
are
beliefs
images
of
mortal
thought
perimposed
upon
the
body
that
they
are
not
the
truth
of
man
that
they
should
be
treated
as
error
and
put
out
of
thought
then
these
ills
will
disappear
the
lungs
if
the
body
is
diseased
this
is
but
one
of
the
beliefs
of
mortal
mind
mortal
man
will
be
less
mortal
when
he
learns
that
matter
never
sustained
existence
and
can
never
destroy
god
who
is
man
life
when
this
is
understood
mankind
will
be
more
spiritual
and
know
that
there
is
nothing
to
consume
since
spirit
god
is
what
if
the
belief
is
consumption
god
is
more
to
a
man
than
his
belief
and
the
less
we
knowledge
matter
or
its
laws
the
more
immortality
we
possess
consciousness
constructs
a
better
body
when
faith
in
matter
has
been
conquered
correct
material
belief
by
spiritual
understanding
and
spirit
will
form
you
anew
you
will
never
fear
again
except
to
offend
god
and
you
will
never
believe
that
heart
or
any
tion
of
the
body
can
destroy
you
soundness
maintained
if
you
have
sound
and
capacious
lungs
and
want
them
to
remain
so
be
always
ready
with
the
mental
protest
against
the
opposite
belief
in
heredity
discard
all
notions
about
lungs
tubercles
herited
consumption
or
disease
arising
from
any
cumstance
and
you
will
find
that
mortal
mind
when
instructed
by
truth
yields
to
divine
power
which
steers
the
body
into
health
our
footsteps
heavenward
the
discoverer
of
christian
science
finds
the
path
less
difficult
when
she
has
the
high
goal
always
before
her
thoughts
than
when
she
counts
her
footsteps
in
endeavoring
to
reach
it
when
the
nation
is
desirable
expectation
speeds
our
progress
the
struggle
for
truth
makes
one
strong
instead
of
weak
resting
instead
of
wearying
one
if
the
belief
in
death
were
obliterated
and
the
understanding
obtained
that
there
is
no
death
this
would
be
a
tree
of
life
known
by
its
fruits
man
should
renew
his
energies
and
deavors
and
see
the
folly
of
hypocrisy
while
also
ing
the
necessity
of
working
out
his
own
salvation
when
it
is
learned
that
disease
can
not
destroy
life
and
that
mortals
are
not
saved
from
sin
or
sickness
by
death
this
understanding
will
quicken
into
newness
of
life
it
will
master
either
a
desire
to
die
or
a
dread
of
the
grave
and
thus
destroy
the
great
fear
that
besets
mortal
existence
christian
standard
the
relinquishment
of
all
faith
in
death
and
also
of
the
fear
of
its
sting
would
raise
the
standard
of
health
and
morals
far
beyond
its
present
elevation
and
would
enable
us
to
hold
the
banner
of
christianity
aloft
with
unflinching
faith
in
god
in
life
eternal
sin
brought
death
and
death
will
disappear
with
the
disappearance
of
sin
man
is
immortal
and
the
body
can
not
die
because
matter
has
no
life
to
render
the
human
concepts
named

death
ease
sickness
and
sin
are
all
that
can
be
destroyed
life
not

on
matter
if
it
is
true
that
man
lives
this
fact
can
never
change
in
science
to
the
opposite
belief
that
man
dies
life
is
the
law
of
soul
even
the
law
of
the
spirit
of
truth
and
soul
is
never
without
its
ative
man
individual
being
can
no
more
die
nor
disappear
in
unconsciousness
than
can
soul
for
both
are
immortal
if
man
believes
in
death
now
he
must
disbelieve
in
it
when
learning
that
there
is
no
reality
in
death
since
the
truth
of
being
is
deathless
the
lief
that
existence
is
contingent
on
matter
must
be
met
and
mastered
by
science
before
life
can
be
understood
and
harmony
obtained
mortality
vanquished
death
is
but
another
phase
of
the
dream
that
ence
can
be
material
nothing
can
interfere
with
the
harmony
of
being
nor
end
the
existence
of
man
in
science
man
is
the
same
after
as
before
a
bone
is
broken
or
the
body
guillotined
if
man
is
never
to
overcome
death
why
do
the
scriptures
say
the
last
enemy
that
shall
be
destroyed
is
death
the
tenor
of
the
word
shows
that
we
shall
obtain
the
victory
over
death
in
proportion
as
we
overcome
sin
the
great
difficulty
lies
in
ignorance
of
what
god
is
god
life
truth
and
love
make
man
undying
immortal
mind
governing
all
must
be
acknowledged
as
supreme
in
the
physical
realm
as
well
as
in
the
spiritual
no
death
nor
inaction
called
to
the
bed
of
death
what
material
remedy
has
man
when
all
such
remedies
have
failed
spirit
is
his
last
resort
but
it
should
have
been
his
first
and
only
resort
the
dream
of
death
must
be
mastered
by
mind
here
or
hereafter
thought
will
waken
from
its
own
material
declaration
i
am
dead
to
catch
this
of
truth
there
is
no
death
no
inaction
diseased
action
overaction
nor
reaction
vision
opening
life
is
real
and
death
is
the
illusion
a

of
the
facts
of

in
jesus
way
resolves
the
dark
visions
of
material
sense
into
harmony
and
immortality
man
privilege
at
this
supreme
moment
is
to
prove
the
words
of
our
master
if
a
man
keep
my
saying
he
shall
never
see
death
to
divest
thought
of
false
trusts
and
material
evidences
in
order
that
the
spiritual
facts
of
being
may
appear
this
is
the
great
attainment
by
means
of
which
we
shall
sweep
away
the
false
and
give
place
to
the
true
thus
we
may
establish
in
truth
the
temple
or
body
whose
builder
and
maker
is
god
intelligent
consecration
we
should
consecrate
existence
not
to
the
unknown
god
whom
we
ignorantly
worship
but
to
the
eternal
builder
the
everlasting
father
to
the
life
which
mortal
sense
can
not
impair
nor
mortal
belief
destroy
we
must
realize
the
ability
of
mental
might
to
offset
human
misconceptions
and
to
replace
them
with
the
life
which
is
spiritual
not
material
the
present
immortality
the
great
spiritual
fact
must
be
brought
out
that
man
not
perfect
and
immortal
we
must
hold
forever
the
consciousness
of
existence
and
sooner
or
later
through
christ
and
christian
science
we
must
master
sin
and
death
the
evidence
of
man
immortality
will
become
more
apparent
as
terial
beliefs
are
given
up
and
the
immortal
facts
of
being
are
admitted
careful
guidance
the
author
has
healed
hopeless
organic
disease
and
raised
the
dying
to
life
and
health
through
the
standing
of
god
as
the
only
life
it
is
a
sin
to
believe
that
aught
can
overpower
omnipotent
and
eternal
life
and
this
life
must
be
brought
to
light
by
the
ing
that
there
is
no
death
as
well
as
by
other
graces
of
spirit
we
must
begin
however
with
the
more
simple
demonstrations
of
control
and
the
sooner
we
begin
the
better
the
final
demonstration
takes
time
for
its
accomplishment
when
walking
we
are
guided
by
the
eye
we
look
before
our
feet
and
if
we
are
wise
we
look
beyond
a
single
step
in
the
line
of
spiritual
advancement

if
we

we

the

thus
i
represent
i
was
present
on
certain
nights
when
the

i
was
personally
abused
on

occasions
i
was
told
that

when

notwithstanding

sometimes
going

immediately
after

at
last
he
committed
which
i
considered
criminal
inasmuch
as
this

is
deemed

therefore
i
arrested

in

of
the

namely
the

cast
him
into

at

my

with

addresses
the
jury
of

he
alyzes
the

reviews
the
testimony
and
explains
the

his
conclusion

that

judge

urges
the
jury
not
to
allow
their

to
be
warped
by
the
irrational
unchristian

of

the
jury
must
regard
in
such

only
the
evidence
of

against
mortal

as
the

proceeds
the

grows
restless
his
sallow

blanches
with

and
a

and
death
settles
upon

the

consultation
ensues
and
the

returns
a
verdict
of
guilty
of
in
the
first
degree
mortal
man
sentenced
judge
medicine
then
proceeds
to
pronounce
the
solemn
sentence
of
death
upon
the
prisoner
because
he
has
loved
his
neighbor
as
himself
mortal
man
has
been
guilty
of
benevolence
in
the
first
degree
and
this
has
led
him
into
the
commission
of
the
second
crime
which
material
laws
condemn
as
homicide
for
this
crime
mortal

is
sentenced
to
be
tortured
until
he
is
dead
may
god
have
mercy
on
your

is
the

solemn
peroration
the
prisoner
is
then
remanded
to
his

and
scholastic

is
sent
for
to
prepare
the

god
which
sense
must
be
immortal
for
appeal
to
a

ah
but
christ
truth
the
spirit
of

and
the

of
mortal

can
open

those

doors
and
set

there
comes

it

the

supersedes

let
us
follow

counsel
for

after
much
debate
and
opposition
permission
is
tained
for
a
trial
in
the
court
of

where
christian
science
is
allowed
to
appear
as
counsel
for
the
unfortunate
prisoner
witnesses
judges

jurors
who
were
at
the
previous
court
of

are
now
summoned
to

eternal

when
the

with

and
triumph

then
christian
science
turns
suddenly
to
the
supreme
tribunal
and
opens
the
argument
for
the
defence
the
prisoner
at
the
bar
has
been
unjustly
sentenced
his
trial
was
a
tragedy
and
is
morally
illegal
mortal
man
has
had
no
proper
counsel
in
the
case
all
the
mony
has
been
on
the
side
of
personal
sense
and
we
shall
unearth
this
foul
conspiracy
against
the
liberty
and
life
of
man
the
only
valid
testimony
in
the
case
shows
the
alleged
crime
never
to
have
been
committed
the
oner
is
not
proved
worthy
of
death
or
of
bonds
your
honor
the
lower
court
has
sentenced
mortal
man
to
die
but
god
made
man
immortal
and
amenable
to

only
denying
justice
to
the

that

to

lawgiver
who
or
what
has
sinned
has
the
body
or
has
mortal
mind
committed
a
criminal
deed
counsellor
false
belief
has
argued
that
the
body
should
die
while
reverend
theology
would
console
conscious
mortal

which
alone
is

of
sin
and

no

mortal

in
obedience
to

helped
his
man
an
act
which
should
result
in
good
to
himself
as
well
as
to
others
the
law
of
our
supreme
court
decrees
that
whosoever
shall
die
but
good
deeds
are
immortal
bringing
joy
instead
of
grief
pleasure
instead
of
pain
and
life
instead
of
death
if
was
committed
by
trampling
on
laws
of
health
this
was
a
good
deed
for
the
agent
of
those
laws
is
an
outlaw
a
destroyer
of
mortal
man
liberty
and
rights
laws
of
health
should
be
tenced
to
die
watching
beside
the
couch
of
pain
in
the
exercise
of
a
love
that
is
the
fulfilling
of
the
law
doing
unto
others
as
ye
would
that
they
should
do
unto
you
this
is
no
infringement
of
law
for
no
demand
human
or
divine
renders
it
just
to
punish
a
man
for
acting
justly
if
tals
sin
our
supreme
judge
in
equity
decides
what
penalty
is
due
for
the
sin
and
mortal
man
can
suffer
only
for
his
sin
for
naught
else
can
he
be
punished
according
to
the
law
of
spirit
god
then
what
jurisdiction
had
his
honor
judge
medicine
in
this
case
to
him
i
might
say
in
bible
language
test
thou
to
judge
after
the
law
and
commandest
to
be
smitten
contrary
to
the
law
the
only
jurisdiction
to
which
the
prisoner
can
submit
is
that
of
truth
life
and
love
if
they
condemn
him
not
neither
shall
judge
cine
condemn
him
and
i
ask
that
the

be
restored
to

he
has
been
unjustly
deprived

however
at
the
trial
as
a

against
mortal

and
in
the
interest
of
personal

a

your
supreme
court
must
find
the
oner
on
the
night
of
the
alleged
offence
to
have
been
acting
within
the
limits
of

in
obedience
thereto
upon

all

laying

such

bear
their

under

was

who
handcuffed
mortal

and
would
now
punish
him
you
have
left
mortal

no
alternative
he
must
obey
your
law
fear
its
consequences
and
be

for
his
fear
his
friends
struggled
hard
to
rescue
the

from
the
penalty
they
considered
justly
due
but
they
were
compelled
to
let
him
be
taken

tried

thereupon
judge

twelve

for

one
of

he
also
testified

to
be
truthful
that
he
knew
man
and
that

in

but
was
a

this
is
a
foul
aspersion
on

it
blots
the

it
dicates

a

the

i
proclaim
this

to
be
destitute

and
to

the

here
the

various

rose
to
the

of

from

for
such
illegality
they
declared
that

was
overthrowing
the

of

the

then
read
from

instead
of
being
a

in

in

while

good

the

of

with
benign
and
imposing

comprehending

defining
all

and
dence
explained
from
his
the
bible
that
any
law
which
takes
to
punish
aught
but
sin
is
null
and
void
he
also
decided
that

he
concluded
his

thus
the

we

by

as
to
the

of
systematic

she
tries
to
show

that
under

a

tends

to

not

to
those
who
hold
these
fering
opinions
let
us
be
faithful
in
pointing
the
way
through
christ
as
we
understand
it
but
let
us
also
be
careful
always
to
judge
righteous

and
never
to
condemn
rashly
whosoever
shall
smite
thee
on
thy

turn
to
him
the
other
also
that
is
fear
not
that

again
for
thy
bearance
if
ecclesiastical
sects
or
medical
schools
turn
a
deaf
ear
to
the
teachings
of

then
part
from
these
opponents
as
did
abraham
when
he
parted

let
there

thee

children
in
divine
science
are
one
harmonious
family
but
mortals
or
the
children
of
men
in
material
sense
are
discordant
and
ofttimes
false
brethren
conforming
to
explicit
rules
the
teacher
must
make
clear
to
students
the
science
of
healing
especially
its
ethics
that
all
is
mind
and
that
the
scientist
must
conform
to
god
requirements
also
the
teacher
must
thoroughly
fit
his
students
to
defend
themselves
against
sin
and
to
guard
against
the
attacks
of
the
who
attempts
to
kill
morally
and
physically
no
hypothesis
as
to
the
existence
of

interpose

the

there

you

expose

denounce
the
claims
of

in

their
forms

realize
no

in

a
sinner
is
not
reformed
merely
by
assuring
him
that
he
can
not
be
a
sinner
because
there
is
no
sin
to
put
down
the
claim
of

you
must
detect
it
remove
the
mask
point
out
the
illusion
and
thus
get
the
victory
over
sin
and
so
prove
its
unreality
the
sick
are
not
healed
merely
by
declaring
there
is
no
sickness
but
by
knowing
that
there
is
none
wicked
evasions
a
sinner
is
afraid
to
cast
the
first
stone
he
may
say
as
a
subterfuge
that
evil
is
unreal
but
to
know
it
he
must
demonstrate
his
statement
to
assume
that
there
are
no
claims
of
evil
and
yet
to
indulge
them
is
a
moral
offence
blindness
and
cling
fast
to
iniquity
when
the
publican
wail
went
out
to
the
great
heart
of
love
it
won
his
humble
desire
evil
which
obtains
in
the
bodily
senses
but
which
the
heart
condemns
has
no
foundation
but
if
evil
is
uncondemned
it
is
undenied
and
nurtured
under
such
circumstances
to
say
that
there
is
no
evil
is
an
evil
in
itself
when

christian

rises
above

if

do
not
congratulate
yourself
upon

unless
this

follows
the

is
a

only
in

three
classes
of
neophytes
there
is
a
large
class
of
thinkers
whose
bigotry
and
conceit
twist
every
fact
to
suit
themselves
their
creed
teaches
belief
in
a
mysterious
supernatural
god
and
in
a
natural
devil
other
class
still
more
unfortunate
are
so
depraved
that
they
appear
to
be
innocent
they
utter
a
falsehood
while
looking
you
blandly
in
the
face
and
they
never
fail
to
stab
their
benefactor
in
the
back
a
third
class
of
thinkers
build
with
solid
masonry
they
are
sincere
generous
noble
and
are
therefore
open
to
the
approach
and
recognition
of
truth
to
teach
christian
science
to
such
as
these
is
no
task
they
do
not
incline
ingly
to
error
whine
over
the
demands
of
truth
nor
play
the
traitor
for
place
and
power
touchstone
of
science
some
people
yield
slowly
to
the
touch
of
truth
few
yield
without
a
struggle
and
many
are
reluctant
to
knowledge
that
they
have
yielded
but
less
this
admission
is
made
evil
will
boast
itself
above
good
the
christian
scientist
has
enlisted
to
lessen
evil
disease
and
death
and
he
will
overcome
them
by
understanding
their
nothingness
and
the
allness
of
god
or
good
sickness
to
him
is
no
less
a
temptation
than
is
sin
and
he
heals
them
both
by
understanding
god
power
over
them
the
christian
scientist
knows
that
they
are
errors
of
belief
which
truth
can
and
will
destroy
false
claims
annihilated
who
that
has
felt
the
perilous
beliefs
in
life
substance
and
intelligence
separated
from
god
can
say
that
there
is
no
error
of
belief

the
claim

magnetism
that
all
evil
combines
in
the
belief
of
life
substance
and
intelligence
in
matter
electricity
animal
nature
and
organic
life
who
will
deny
that
these
are
the
errors
which
truth
must

will
nihilate
christian
scientists
must
live
under
the
stant
pressure
of
the
apostolic
command
to
come
out
from

students
of
christian
science
who
start
with
its
letter
and
think
to
succeed
without
the

will
either
make
shipwreck
of
their
faith
or
be
turned
sadly
awry
they
must
not

every
christian

every
conscientious
teacher
of
the

of
knows
that
human

is
not

and
he
must
nize
this
in

from

of

he
feels
morally

hence
the
necessity
of
being
right
yourself
in

teach
this

you
must
utilize
the
moral
might
of
mind
in

to
walk
over

and
support
your
claims
by
demonstration
if
you

god

it

no

assured
this
strong
point
in

is
not
to
be
overlooked
that

not

chicanery
impossible
teaching

strict

to
the

and
rules
of
the
scientific
method
has
secured
the
only
success
of
the
students
of
christian

this
alone
entitles
them
to
the
high
standing
which
most
of
them
hold
in
the
community
a
reputation
perimentally
justified
by
their
efforts
whoever
firms
that
there
is
more
than
one
principle

of

christian

greatly
errs
rantly

intentionally
and
separates
himself
from
the
true
conception
of
christian

healing
and
from
its
possible
demonstration
no
dishonest
concessions
any
dishonesty
in
your
theory
and
practice
betrays
a
gross
ignorance
of
the
method
of
the
science
makes
no
concessions
to
persons
or
opinions
one
must
abide
in
the
of

or
he
can
not
demonstrate
the
divine
principle
so
long
as
matter
is
the
basis
of

illness
can
not
be
ciously
treated
by

truth
does
the
work
and
you
must
both
understand

abide

the
divine

this
volume
indispensable
a
christian
scientist
requires
my
work
science
and
health
for
his
textbook
and
so
do
all
his
students
and
patients
why
because
it
is
the
voice
of
truth
to
this
age
and
contains
the
full
statement
of
christian
science
or
the
science
of
healing
through
mind
because
it
was
the
first
book
known
containing
a
thorough
statement
of
christian
science
hence
it
gave
the
first
rules
for
demonstrating
this
science
and
registered
the
revealed
truth
taminated
by
human
hypotheses
other
works
which
have
borrowed
from
this
book
without
giving
it
credit
have
adulterated
the
science
because
this
book
has
done
more
for
teacher
and
student
for
healer
and
patient
than
has
been
accomplished
by
other
books
purity
of
science
since
the
divine
light
of
christian
science
first
dawned
upon
the
author
she
has
never
used
this
newly
discovered
power
in
any
direction
which
she
fears
to
have
fairly
understood
her
prime
object
since
entering
this
field
of
labor
has
been
to
prevent
suffering
not
to
produce
it
that
we
can
not
scientifically
both
cure
and
cause
disease
is
in
the
legend
of
the
shield
which
led
to
a
quarrel
between
two
knights
because
each
of
them
could
see
but
one
face
of
it
both
sides
were
beautiful
according
to
their
degree
but
to
mental
malpractice
prolific
of
evil
there
is
no
good
pect
either
silvern
or
golden
backsliders
and
mistakes
christian
science
is
not
an
exception
to
the
general
rule
that
there
is
no
excellence
without
labor
in
a
direct
line
one
can
not
scatter
his
fire
and
at
the
same
time
hit
the
mark
to
pursue
other
vocations
and
advance
rapidly
in
the
demonstration
of
this
science
is
not
possible
departing
from
christian
science
some
learners
commend
diet
and
hygiene
they
even
practise
these
intending
thereby
to
initiate
the
cure
which
they
mean
to
complete
with
mind
as
if
the
could
aid
mind
the
demonstration
rests
on
one
principle
and
there
must
and
can
be
no
opposite
rule
let
this
principle
be
plied
to
the
cure
of
disease
without
exploiting
other
means
mental
charlatanism
mental
quackery
rests
on
the
same
platform
as
all
other
quackery
the
chief
plank
in
this
platform
is
the
doctrine
that
science
has
two
principles
in
partnership
one
good
and
the
other
evil
one
spiritual
the
other
material
and
that
these
two
may
be
simultaneously
at
work
on
the
sick
this
theory
is
supposed
to
favor
practice
from
both
a
mental
and
a
material
standpoint
another
plank
in
the
form
is
this
that
error
will
finally
have
the
same
effect
as
truth
divinity
ever
ready
it
is
anything
but
scientifically
christian
to
think
of
aiding
the
divine
principle
of
healing
or
of
trying
to
tain
the
human
body
until
the
divine
mind
is
ready
to
take
the
case
divinity
is
always
ready
is
truth
motto
having
seen
so
much
suffering
from
quackery
the
author
desires
to
keep
it
out
of
christian
science
the
sword
of
truth
must
turn
in
every
direction
to
guard
the
tree
of
life
the
panoply
of
wisdom
sin
makes
deadly
thrusts
at
the
christian
scientist
as
ritualism
and
creed
are
summoned
to
give
place
to
higher
law
but
science
will
ameliorate
mortal
malice
the
christianly
scientific
man
reflects
the
divine
law
thus
becoming
a
law
unto
himself
he
does
violence
to
no
man
neither
is
he
a
false
accuser
the
christian
scientist
wisely
shapes
his
course
and
is
est
and
consistent
in
following
the
leadings
of
divine
mind
he
must
prove
through
living
as
well
as
ing
and
teaching
that
christ
way
is
the
only
one
by
which
mortals
are
radically
saved
from
sin
and
sickness
advancement
by
sacrifice
christianity
causes
men
to
turn
naturally
from
matter
to
spirit
as
the
flower
turns
from
darkness
to
light
man
then
appropriates
those
things
which
eye
hath
not
seen
nor
ear
heard
paul
and
john
had
a
clear
apprehension
that
as
mortal
man
achieves
no
worldly
honors
except
by
sacrifice
so
he
must
gain
heavenly
riches
by
forsaking
all
ness
then
he
will
have
nothing
in
common
with
the
worldling
affections
motives
and
aims
judge
not
the
future
advancement
of
christian
science
by
the
steps
already
taken
lest
you
yourself
be
condemned
for
ing
to
take
the
first
step
dangerous
knowledge
any
attempt
to
heal
mortals
with
erring
mortal
mind
instead
of
resting
on
the
omnipotence
of
the
divine
mind
must
prove
abortive
committing
the
bare
process
of
mental
healing
to
frail
tals
untaught
and
unrestrained
by
christian
science
is
like
putting
a
sharp
knife
into
the
hands
of
a
blind
man
or
a
raging
maniac
and
turning
him
loose
in
the
crowded
streets
of
a
city
whether
animated
by
malice
or
ignorance
a
false
practitioner
will
work
chief
and
ignorance
is
more
harmful
than
wilful
ness
when
the
latter
is
distrusted
and
thwarted
in
its
incipiency
certainty
of
results
to
mortal
sense
christian
science
seems
abstract
but
the
process
is
simple
and
the
results
are
sure
if
the
science
is
understood
the
tree
must
be
good
which
produces
good
fruit
guided
by
divine
truth
and
not
guesswork
the
that
is
the
student
the
christian
and
scientific
expounder
of
the
divine
law
treats
disease
with
more
certain
results
than
any
other
healer
on
the
globe
the
christian
scientist
should
understand
and
adhere
strictly
to
the
rules
of
divine
physics
as
laid
down
in
this
work
and
rest
his
tion
on
this
sure
basis
ontology
defined
ontology
is
defined
as
the
science
of
the
necessary
constituents
and
relations
of
all
beings
and
it
lies
all
metaphysical
practice
our
system
of
rests
on
the
apprehension
of
the
nature
and
essence
of
all
being
on
the
divine
mind
and
love
essential
qualities
its
pharmacy
is
moral
and
its
medicine
is
intellectual
and
spiritual
though
used
for
physical
healing
yet
this
most
fundamental
part
of
metaphysics
is
the
one
most
difficult
to
understand
and
demonstrate
for
to
the
material
thought
all
is
material
till
such
thought
is
rectified
by
spirit
mischievous
imagination
sickness
is
neither
imaginary
nor
unreal
that
is
to
the
frightened
false
sense
of
the
patient
sickness
is
more
than
fancy
it
is
solid
conviction
it
is
therefore
to
be
dealt
with
through
right
prehension
of
the
truth
of
being
if
christian
healing
is
abused
by
mere
smatterers
in
science
it
becomes
a
tedious
instead
of
scientifically
ing
a
cure
it
starts
a
petty
crossfire
over
every
cripple
and
invalid
buffeting
them
with
the
superficial
and
cold
assertion
nothing
ails
you
author
early
instructions
when
the
science
of
mind
was
a
fresh
revelation
to
the
author
she
had
to
impart
while
teaching
its
grand
facts
the
hue
of
spiritual
ideas
from
her
own
spiritual
condition
and
she
had
to
do
this
orally
through
the
meagre
channel
afforded
by
language
and
by
her
manuscript
circulated
among
the
students
as
mer
beliefs
were
gradually
expelled
from
her
thought
the
teaching
became
clearer
until
finally
the
shadow
of
old
errors
was
no
longer
cast
upon
divine
science
proof
by
induction
i
do
not
maintain
that
anyone
can
exist
in
the
flesh
without
food
and
raiment
but
i
do
believe
that
the
real
man
is
immortal
and
that
he
lives
in
spirit
not
matter
christian
science
must
be
accepted
at
this
period
by
induction
we
admit
the
whole
because
a
part
is
proved
and
that
part
illustrates
and
proves
the
entire
principle
christian
science
can
be
taught
only
by
those
who
are
morally
advanced
and
spiritually
endowed
for
it
is
not
superficial
nor
is
it
discerned
from
the
standpoint
of
the
human
senses
only
by
the
illumination
of
the
spiritual
sense
can
the
light
of
understanding
be
thrown
upon
this
science
because
science
reverses
the
evidence
before
the
material
senses
and
furnishes
the
eternal
interpretation
of
god
and
man
if
you
believe
that
you
are
sick
should
you
say
i
am
sick
no
but
you
should
tell
your
belief
sometimes
if
this
be
requisite
to
protect
others
if
you
commit
a
crime
should
you
acknowledge
to
yourself
that
you
are
a
criminal
yes
your
responses
should
differ
because
of
the
different
effects
they
produce
usually
to
admit
that
you
are
sick
renders
your
case
less
curable
while
to
recognize
your
sin
aids
in
destroying
it
both
sin
and
sickness
are
error
and
truth
is
their
remedy
the
truth
regarding
error
is
that
error
is
not
true
hence
it
is
unreal
to
prove
scientifically
the
error
or
unreality
of
sin
you
must
first
see
the
claim
of
sin
and
then
destroy
it
whereas
to
prove
scientifically
the
error
or
unreality
of
disease
you
must
mentally
unsee
the
disease
then
you
will
not
feel
it
and
it
is
destroyed
rapidity
of
assimilation
systematic
teaching
and
the
student
spiritual
growth
and
experience
in
practice
are
requisite
for
a
thorough
comprehension
of
christian
science
some
als
assimilate
truth
more
readily
than
others
but
any
student
who
adheres
to
the
divine
rules
of
christian
science
and
imbibes
the
spirit
of
christ
can
demonstrate
christian
science
cast
out
error
heal
the
sick
and
add
continually
to
his
store
of
spiritual
understanding
potency
enlightenment
and
success
divided
loyalty
if
the
student
goes
away
to
practise
truth
ings
only
in
part
dividing
his
interests
between
god
and
mammon
and
substituting
his
own
views
for
truth
he
will
inevitably
reap
the
error
he
sows
whoever
would
demonstrate
the
healing
of
christian
science
must
abide
strictly
by
its
rules
heed
every
ment
and
advance
from
the
rudiments
laid
down
there
is
nothing
difficult
nor
toilsome
in
this
task
when
the
way
is
pointed
out
but
sincerity
christianity
and
persistence
alone
win
the
prize
as
they
usually
do
in
every
department
of

anatomy

anatomy
when
conceived
of
spiritually
is
mental
knowledge
and
consists
in
the
dissection
of
thoughts
to
discover
their
quality
quantity
and
origin
are
thoughts
divine
or
human
that
is
the
important
question
this
branch
of
study
is
sable
to
the
excision
of
error
the
anatomy
of
christian
science
teaches
when
and
how
to
probe
the
flicted
wounds
of
selfishness
malice
envy
and
hate
it
teaches
the
control
of
mad
ambition
it
unfolds
the
hallowed
influences
of
unselfishness
philanthropy
itual
love
it
urges
the
government
of
the
body
both
in
health
and
in
sickness
the
christian
scientist
through
understanding
mental
anatomy
discerns
and
deals
with
the
real
cause
of
disease
the
material
cian
gropes
among
phenomena
which
fluctuate

under

not

so

stumble
and

in

darkness
scientific
obstetrics
teacher
and
student
should
also
be
familiar
with
the
obstetrics
taught
by
this
science
to
attend
properly
the
birth
of
the
new
child
or
divine
idea
you
should
so
detach
mortal
thought
from
its
material
conceptions
that
the
birth
will
be
natural
and
safe
though
gathering
new
energy
this
idea
can
not
injure
its
useful
surroundings
in
the
travail
of
spiritual
birth
a
spiritual
idea
has
not
a
single
element
of
error
and
this
truth
removes
properly
whatever
is
offensive
the
new
idea
conceived
and
born
of
truth
and
love
is
clad
in
white
garments
its
beginning
will
be
meek
its
growth
sturdy
and
its
maturity
undecaying
when
this
new
birth
takes
place
the
christian
science
infant
is
born
of
the
spirit
born
of
god
and
can
cause
the
mother
no
more
suffering
by
this
we
know
that
truth
is
here
and
has
fulfilled
its
perfect
work
unhesitating
decision
to
decide
quickly
as
to
the
proper
treatment
of
error
whether
error
is
manifested
in
forms
of
sickness
sin
or
death
is
the
first
step
towards
ing
error
our
master
treated
error
through
mind
he
never
enjoined
obedience
to
the
laws
of
nature
if
by
these
are
meant
laws
of
matter
nor
did
he
use
drugs
there
is
a
law
of
god
applicable
to
healing
and
it
is
a
spiritual
law
instead
of
material
the
sick
are
not
healed
by
inanimate
matter
or
drugs
as
they
believe
that
they
are
such
seeming
medical
effect
or
action
is
that
of
called
mortal
mind
seclusion
of
the
author
it
has
been
said
to
the
author
the
world
is
fited
by
you
but
it
feels
your
influence
without
seeing
you
why
do
you
not
make
yourself
more
widely
known
could
her
friends
know
how
little
time
the
author
has
had
in
which
to
make
herself
outwardly
known
except
through
her
laborious
publications
and
how
much
time
and
toil
are
still
quired
to
establish
the
stately
operations
of
christian
science
they
would
understand
why
she
is
so
secluded
others
could
not
take
her
place
even
if
willing
so
to
do
she
therefore
remains
unseen
at
her
post
seeking
no
aggrandizement
but
praying
watching
and
working
for
the
redemption
of
mankind
if
from
an
injury
or
from
any
cause
a
christian
tist
were
seized
with
pain
so
violent
that
he
could
not
treat
himself
mentally
and
the
scientists
had
failed
to
relieve
him
the
sufferer
could
call
a
surgeon
who
would
give
him
a
hypodermic
injection
then
when
the
belief
of
pain
was
lulled
he
could
handle
his
own
case
mentally
thus
it
is
that
we
prove
all
things
and
hold
fast
that
which
is
good
the
right
motive
and
its
reward
in
founding
a
pathological
system
of
christianity
the
author
has
labored
to
expound
divine
principle
and
not
to
exalt
personality
the
weapons
of
bigotry
ignorance
envy
fall
before
an
honest
heart
adulterating
christian
science
makes
it
void
falsity
has
no
foundation
the
hireling
fleeth
because
he
is
an
hireling
and
careth
not

neither

nor

ever

there
is
not
principle
and
its
idea
is
one
and
this
one
is
god
omnipotent
omniscient
and
present
being
and
his
reflection
is
man
and
the
universe
is
adopted
from
the
latin
adjective
signifying
hence
god
combines
or
potency
or
true
knowledge
the
varied
tions
of
christian
science
indicate
mind
never
matter
and
have
one
principle
real
unreal
what
are
spirits
and
souls
to
human
belief
they
are
personalities
constituted
of
mind
and
matter
life
and
death
truth
and
error
good
and
evil
but
these
contrasting
pairs
of
terms
represent
contraries
as
tian
science
reveals
which
neither
dwell
together
nor
assimilate
truth
is
immortal
error
is
mortal
truth
is
limitless
error
is
limited
truth
is
intelligent
error
is
moreover
truth
is
real
and
error
is
unreal
this
last
statement
contains
the
point
you
will
most
reluctantly
admit
although
first
and
last
it
is
the
most
important
to
understand
mankind
redeemed
the
term
or
is
as
improper
as
the
term
soul
or
spirit
signifies
deity
and
nothing
else
there
is
no
finite
soul
nor
spirit
soul
or
spirit
means
only
one
mind
and
can
not
be
rendered
in
the
plural
heathen
mythology
and
jewish
theology
have
perpetuated
the
fallacy
that
intelligence
soul
and
life
can
be
in
matter
and
idolatry
and
ritualism
are
the
outcome
of
all
beliefs
the
science
of
christianity
comes
with
fan
in
hand
to
separate
the
chaff
from
the
wheat
science
will
declare
god
aright
and
christianity
will
demonstrate
this
declaration
and
its
divine
principle
making
mankind
better
physically
morally
and
spiritually
two
chief
commands
what
are
the
demands
of
the
science
of
soul
the
first
demand
of
this
science
is
thou
shalt
have
no
other
gods
before
me
this
is
spirit
therefore
the
command
means
this
thou
shalt
have
no
intelligence
no
life
no
substance
no
truth
no
love
but
that
which
is
spiritual
the
second
is
like
unto
it
thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbor
as
thyself
it
should
be
thoroughly
understood
that
all
men
have
one
mind
one
god
and
father
one
life
truth
and
love
mankind
will
become
perfect
in
proportion
as
this
fact
becomes
apparent
war
will
cease
and
the
true
hood
of
man
will
be
established
having
no
other
gods
turning
to
no
other
but
the
one
perfect
mind
to
guide
him
man
is
the
likeness
of
god
pure
and
eternal
ing
that
mind
which
was
also
in
christ
soul
not
confined
in
body
science
reveals
spirit
soul
as
not
in
the
body
and
god
as
not
in
man
but
as
reflected
by
man
the
greater
can
not
be
in
the
lesser
the
belief
that
the
greater
can
be
in
the
lesser
is
an
error
that
works
ill
this
is
a
leading
point
in
the
science
of
soul
that
principle
is
not
in
its
idea
spirit
soul
is
not
confined
in
man
and
is
never
in
matter
we
reason
perfectly
from
effect
to
cause
when
we
conclude
that
matter
is
the
effect
of
spirit
but
reasoning
shows
material
existence
to
be
enigmatical
spirit
gives
the
true
mental
idea
we
can
not
interpret
spirit
mind
through
matter
matter
neither
sees
hears
nor
feels
sinlessness
of
mind
soul
reasoning
from
cause
to
effect
in
the
science
of
mind
we
begin
with
mind
which
must
be
stood
through
the
idea
which
expresses
it
and
can
not
be
learned
from
its
opposite
matter
thus
we
arrive
at
truth
or
intelligence
which
evolves
its
own
unerring
idea
and
never
can
be
coordinate
with
human
illusions
if
soul
sinned
it
would
be
mortal
for
sin
is
mortality
self
because
it
kills
itself
if
truth
is
mortal
error
must
be
mortal
because
error
is
unlike
truth
because
soul
is
immortal
soul
can
not
sin
for
sin
is
not
the
eternal
verity
of
being
what
is
the
scientific
statement
of
being
there
is
no
life
truth
intelligence
nor
stance
in
matter
all
is
infinite
mind
and
its
infinite
manifestation
for
god
is
spirit
is
immortal
truth
matter
is
mortal
error
spirit
is
the
real
and
eternal
matter
is
the
unreal
and
temporal
spirit
is
god
and
man
is
his
image
and
likeness
therefore
man
is
not
material
he
is
spiritual
spiritual
synonyms
what
is
substance
substance
is
that
which
is
eternal
and
pable
of
discord
and
decay
truth
life
and
love
are
substance
as
the
scriptures
use
this
word
in
hebrews
the
substance
of
things
hoped
for
the
evidence
of
things
not

spirit
the
synonym
of
mind
soul
or
god

the
only

the

man

what

life

life
is
without

eternity

infinite
life

death

to

if
life
ever

a

it

also
have
an

what

intelligence
is

it

the
primal
and

quality
of

of
the
triune
principle
life
truth
and
love
named
god
true
sense
of
infinitude
what
is
mind
mind
is
god
the
exterminator
of
error
is
the
great
truth
that
god
good
is
the
mind
and
that
the
supposititious
opposite
of
infinite
mind
called
or
evil
is
not
mind
is
not
truth
but
error
without
intelligence
or
reality
there
can
be
but
one
mind
because
there
is
but
one
god
and
if
mortals
claimed
no
other
mind
and
accepted
no
other
sin
would
be
unknown
we
can
have
but
one
mind
if
that
one
is
infinite
we
bury
the
sense
of
infinitude
when
we
admit
that
although
god
is
infinite
evil
has
a
place
in
this
infinity
for
evil
can
have
no
place
where
all
space
is
filled
with
god
the
sole
governor
we
lose
the
high
signification
of
omnipotence
when
after
admitting
that
god
or
good
is
omnipresent
and
has
we
still
believe
there
is
another
power
named
this
belief
that
there
is
more
than
one
mind
is
as
pernicious
to
divine
theology
as
are
ancient
mythology
and
pagan
idolatry
with
one
father
even
god
the
whole
family
of
man
would
be
brethren
and
with
one
mind
and
that
god
or
good
the
brotherhood
of
man
would
consist
of
love
and
truth
and
have
unity
of
principle
and
spiritual
power
which
constitute
divine
science
the
supposed
existence
of
more
than
one
mind
was
the
basic
error
of
idolatry
this
error
assumed
the
loss
of
spiritual
power
the
loss
of
the
spiritual
presence
of
life
as
infinite
truth
without
an
unlikeness
and
the
loss
of
love
as
ever
present
and
universal
the
divine
standard
of
perfection
divine
science
explains
the
abstract
statement
that
there
is
one
mind
by
the
following
sition
if
god
or
good
is
real
then
evil
the
unlikeness
of
god
is
unreal
and
evil
can
only
seem
to
be
real
by
giving
reality
to
the
unreal
the
children
of
god
have
but
one
mind
how
can
good
lapse
into
evil
when
god
the
mind
of
man
never
sins
the
standard
of
perfection
was
originally
god
and
man
has
god
taken
down
his
own
standard
and
has
man
fallen
indestructible
relationship
god
is
the
creator
of
man
and
the
divine
principle
of
man
remaining
perfect
the
divine
idea
or
reflection
man
remains
perfect
man
is
the
expression
of
god
being
if
there
ever
was
a
moment
when
man
did
not
express
the
divine
tion
then
there
was
a
moment
when
man
did
not
express
god
and
consequently
a
time
when
deity
was
pressed
that
is
without
entity
if
man
has
lost
fection
then
he
has
lost
his
perfect
principle
the
divine
mind
if
man
ever
existed
without
this
perfect
principle
or
mind
then
man
existence
was
a
myth
the
relations
of
god
and
man
divine
principle
and
idea
are
indestructible
in
science
and
science
knows
no
lapse
from
nor
return
to
harmony
but
holds
the
divine
order
or
spiritual
law
in
which
god
and
all
that
he
ates
are
perfect
and
eternal
to
have
remained
unchanged
in
its
eternal
history
celestial
evidence
the
unlikeness
of
truth
named
the
posite
of
science
and
the
evidence
before
the
five
poreal
senses
afford
no
indication
of
the
grand
facts
of
being
even
as
these
senses
receive
no
intimation
of
the
earth
motions
or
of
the
science
of
astronomy
but
yield
assent
to
astronomical
propositions
on
the
authority
of
natural
science
the
facts
of
divine
science
should
be
admitted
although
the
evidence
as
to
these
facts
is
not
supported
by
evil
by
matter
or
by
material
sense
because
the
evidence
that
god
and
man
coexist
is
fully
sustained
by
spiritual
sense
man
is
and
forever
has
been
god
flection
god
is
infinite
therefore
ever
present
and
there
is
no
other
power
nor
presence
hence
the
uality
of
the
universe
is
the
only
fact
of
creation
let
god
be
true
but
every
material
man
a
liar
the
test
of
experience
are
doctrines
and
creeds
a
benefit
to
man
the
author
subscribed
to
an
orthodox
creed
in
early
youth
and
tried
to
adhere
to
it
until
she
caught
the
first
gleam
of
that
which
prets
god
as
above
mortal
sense
this
view
rebuked
human
beliefs
and
gave
the
spiritual
port
expressed
through
science
of
all
that
proceeds
from
the
divine
mind
since
then
her
highest
creed
has
been
divine
science
which
reduced
to
human
sion
she
has
named
christian
science
this
science
teaches
man
that
god
is
the
only
life
and
that
this
life
is
truth
and
love
that
god
is
to
be
understood
adored
and
demonstrated
that
divine
truth
casts
out
tional
error
and
heals
the
sick
god
law
destroys
evil
the
way
which
leads
to
christian
science
is
straight
and
narrow
god
has
set
his
signet
upon
science
ing
it
coordinate
with
all
that
is
real
and
only
with
that
which
is
harmonious
and
eternal
sickness
sin
and
death
being
inharmonious
do
not
originate
in
god
nor
belong
to
his
government
his
law
rightly
understood
destroys
them
jesus
furnished
proofs
of
these
statements
evanescent
materiality
what
is
error
error
is
a
supposition
that
pleasure
and
pain
that
intelligence
substance
life
are
existent
in
ter
error
is
neither
mind
nor
one
of
faculties
error
is
the
contradiction
of
truth
error
is
a
belief
without
understanding
error
is
unreal
because
untrue
it
is
that
which
seemeth
to
be
and
is
not
if
error
were
true
its
truth
would
be
error
and
we
should
have
a
absurdity
namely
thus
we
should
continue
to
lose
the
standard
of
truth
unrealities
that
seem
real
is
there
no
sin
all
reality
is
in
god
and
his
creation
monious
and
eternal
that
which
he
creates
is
good
and
he
makes
all
that
is
made
therefore
the
only
reality
of
sin
sickness
or
death
is
the
awful
fact
that
unrealities
seem
real
to
human
erring
belief
until
god
strips
off
their
disguise
they
are
not
true
because
they
are
not
of
god
we
learn
in
christian
science
that
all
inharmony
of
mortal
mind
or
body
is
sion
possessing
neither
reality
nor
identity
though
seeming
to
be
real
and
identical
christ
the
ideal
truth
the
science
of
mind
disposes
of
all
evil
truth
god
is
not
the
father
of
error
sin
sickness
and
death
are
to
be
classified
as
effects
of
error
christ
came
to
destroy
the
belief
of
sin
the
principle
is
omnipresent
and
omnipotent
god
is
where
and
nothing
apart
from
him
is
present
or
has
power
christ
is
the
ideal
truth
that
comes
to
heal
sickness
and
sin
through
christian
science
and
attributes
all
power
to
god
jesus
is
the
name
of
the
man
who
more
than
all
other
men
has
presented
christ
the
true
idea
of
god
healing
the
sick
and
the
sinning
and
ing
the
power
of
death
jesus
is
the
human
man
and
christ
is
the
divine
idea
hence
the
duality
of
jesus
the
christ
jesus
not
god
in
an
age
of
ecclesiastical
despotism
jesus
introduced
the
teaching
and
practice
of
christianity
affording
the
proof
of
christianity
truth
and
love
but
to
reach
his
example
and
to
test
its
unerring
ence
according
to
his
rule
healing
sickness
sin
and
death
a
better
understanding
of
god
as
divine
ciple
love
rather
than
personality
or
the
man
jesus
is
required
jesus
not
understood
jesus
established
what
he
said
by
demonstration
thus
making
his
acts
of
higher
importance
than
his
words
he
proved
what
he
taught
this
is
the
science
of
christianity
jesus
the
principle
which
heals
the
sick
and
casts
out
error
to
be
divine
few
however
except
his
students
derstood
in
the
least
his
teachings
and
their
glorious
proofs
namely
that
life
truth
and
love
the
ciple
of
this
unacknowledged
science
destroy
all
error
evil
disease
and
death
miracles
rejected
the
reception
accorded
to
truth
in
the
early
tian
era
is
repeated
whoever
introduces
the
science
of
christianity
will
be
scoffed
at
and
scourged
with
worse
cords
than
those
which
cut
the
flesh
to
the
ignorant
age
in
which
it
first
appears
science
seems
to
be
a
mistake
hence
the
misinterpretation
and
consequent
maltreatment
which
it
receives
christian
marvels
and
is
the
ple
meaning
of
the
greek
word
rendered
in
the
new
testament
will
be
misunderstood
and
misused
by
many
until
the
glorious
principle
of
these
marvels
is
gained
divine
fulfilment
if
sin
sickness
and
death
are
as
real
as
life
truth
and
love
then
they
must
all
be
from
the
same
source
god
must
be
their
author
now
jesus
came
to
destroy
sin
sickness
and
death
yet
the
scriptures
aver
i
am
not
come
to
destroy
but
to
fulfil
is
it
possible
then
to
believe
that
the
evils
which
jesus
lived
to
destroy
are
real
or
the
offspring
of
the
divine
will
truth
destroys
falsity
despite
the
hallowing
influence
of
truth
in
the
struction
of
error
must
error
still
be
immortal
truth
spares
all
that
is
true
if
evil
is
real
truth
must
make
it
so
but
error
not
truth
is
the
author
of
the
unreal
and
the
unreal
vanishes
while
all
that
is
real
is
eternal
the
apostle
says
that
the
mission
of
christ
is
to
destroy
the
works
of
the
devil
truth
destroys
falsity
and
error
for
light
and
darkness
can
not
dwell
together
light
extinguishes
the
darkness
and
the
scripture
declares
that
there
is
no
night
there
to
truth
there
is
no
error
all
is
truth
to
infinite
spirit
there

the

man

cause
he

he
must
be

man

the

he

he
is
the

all
that

the
conscious

of

as
found
in

in
which
man
is
the
reflection
of

and
therefore
is
eternal
that
which
has
no
separate

holiness
nor
can
god
by
whom
man
is
evolved
engender
the
capacity
or
freedom
to
sin
a
mortal
sinner
is
not
god
man
mortals
are
the
counterfeits
of
immortals
they
are
the
children
of
the
wicked
one
or
the
one
evil
which
declares
that
man
begins
in
dust
or
as
a
material
embryo
in
divine
science
god
and
the
real
man
are
inseparable
as
divine
principle
and
idea
mortals
are
not
immortals
error
urged
to
its
final
limits
is
error
will
cease
to
claim
that
soul
is
in
body
that
life
and
intelligence
are
in
matter
and
that
this
matter
is
man
god
is
the
principle
of
man
and
man
is
the
idea
of
god
hence
man
is
not
mortal
nor
material
mortals
will
disappear
and
mortals
or
the
children
of
god
will
appear
as
the
only
and
eternal
verities
of
man
mortals
are
not
fallen
dren
of
god
they
never
had
a
perfect
state
of
being
which
may
subsequently
be
regained
they
were
from
the
beginning
of
mortal
history
conceived
in
sin
and
brought
forth
in
iniquity
mortality
is
finally
swallowed
up
in
immortality
sin
sickness
and
death
must
appear
to
give
place
to
the
facts
which
belong
to
immortal
man
imperishable
identity
learn
this
o
mortal
and
earnestly
seek
the
spiritual
status
of
man
which
is
outside
of
all
material
selfhood
remember
that
the
scriptures
say
of
mortal
man
as
for
man
his
days
are
as
grass
as
a
flower
of
the
field
so
he
flourisheth
for
the
wind
passeth
over
it
and
it
is
gone
and
the
place
thereof
shall
know
it
no
more
the
kingdom
within
when
speaking
of
god
children
not
the
children
of
men
jesus
said
the
kingdom
of
god
is
within
you
that
is
truth
and
love
reign
in
the
real
man
showing
that
man
in
god
image
is
unfallen
and
eternal
jesus
beheld
in
science
the
fect
man
who
appeared
to
him
where
sinning
mortal
man
appears
to
mortals
in
this
perfect
man
the
saviour
saw
god
own
likeness
and
this
correct
view
of
man
healed
the
sick
thus
jesus
taught
that
the
kingdom
of
god
is
intact
universal
and
that
man
is
pure
and
holy
man
is
not
a
material
habitation
for
soul
he
is
himself
spiritual
soul
being
spirit
is
seen
in
nothing
imperfect
nor
material
material
body
never
god
idea
whatever
is
material
is
mortal
to
the
five
corporeal
senses
man
appears
to
be
matter
and
mind
united
but
christian
science
reveals
man
as
the
idea
of
god
and
declares
the
corporeal
senses
to
be
mortal
and
erring
illusions
divine
science
shows
it
to
be
impossible
that
a
material
body
though
interwoven
with
matter
highest
stratum
misnamed
mind
should
be
man
the
genuine
and
perfect
man
the
immortal
idea
of
being
indestructible
and
eternal
were
it
otherwise
man
would
be
annihilated
reflection
of
spirit
what
are
body
and
soul
identity
is
the
reflection
of
spirit
the
flection
in
multifarious
forms
of
the
living
principle
love
soul
is
the
substance
life
and
gence
of
man
which
is
individualized
but
not
in
matter
soul
can
never
reflect
anything
inferior
to
spirit
man
inseparable
from
spirit
man
is
the
expression
of
soul
the
indians
caught
some
glimpses
of
the
underlying
reality
when
they
called
a
certain
beautiful
lake
the
smile
of
the
great
spirit
separated
from
man
who
expresses
soul
spirit
would
be
a
nonentity
man
divorced
from
spirit
would
lose
his
entity
but
there
is
there
can
be
no
such
division
for
man
is
coexistent
with
god
a
vacant
domicile
what
evidence
of
soul
or
of
immortality
have
you
within
mortality
even
according
to
the
teachings
of
natural
science
man
has
never
beheld
spirit
or
soul
leaving
a
body
or
entering
it
what
basis
is
there
for
the
theory
of
indwelling
spirit
except
the
claim
of
mortal
belief
what
would
be
thought
of
the
declaration
that
a
house
was
inhabited
and
by
a
tain
class
of
persons
when
no
such
persons
were
ever
seen
to
go
into
the
house
or
to
come
out
of
it
nor
were
they
even
visible
through
the
windows
who
can
see
a
soul
in
the
body
harmonious
functions
does
brain
think
and
do
nerves
feel
and
is
there
intelligence
in
matter
no
not
if
god
is
true
and
mortal
man
a
liar
the
assertion
that
there
can
be
pain
or
pleasure
in
matter
is
erroneous
that
body
is
most
harmonious
in
which
the
discharge
of
the
ural
functions
is
least
noticeable
how
can
intelligence
dwell
in
matter
when
matter
is
and
can
not
think
matter
can
not
perform
the
functions
of
mind
error
says
i
am
man
but
this
belief
is
mortal
and
far
from
actual
from
beginning
to
end
whatever
is
mortal
is
composed
of
material
man
beliefs
and
of
nothing
else
that
only
is
real
which
reflects
god
paul
said
but
when
it
pleased
god
who
separated
me
from
my
mother
womb
and
called
me
by
his
grace
i
conferred
not
with
flesh
and
blood
immortal
birthright
is
really
a
phrase
for
man
is
not
mortal
neither
indeed
can
be
man
is
mortal
if
a
child
is
the
offspring
of
physical
sense
and
not
of
soul
the
child
must
have
a
material
not
a
ual
origin
with
what
truth
then
could
the
scriptural
rejoicing
be
uttered
by
any
mother
i
have
gotten
a
man
from
the
lord
on
the
trary
if
aught
comes
from
god
it
can
not
be
mortal
and
material
it
must
be
immortal
and
spiritual
matter
supposed
selfhood
matter
is
neither
nor
a
product
of
spirit
an
image
of
mortal
thought
reflected
on
the
retina
is
all
that
the
eye
beholds
matter
can
not
see
feel
hear
taste
nor
smell
it
is
not
cognizant
can
not
feel
itself
see
itself
nor
understand
itself
take
away
mortal
mind
which
constitutes
matter
supposed
selfhood
and
matter
can
take
no
cognizance
of
matter
does
that
which
we
call
dead
ever
see
hear
feel
or
use
any
of
the
physical
senses
chaos
and
darkness
in
the
beginning
god
created
the
heaven
and
the
earth
and
the
earth
was
without
form
and
void
and
darkness
was
upon
the
face
of
the
deep
genesis
i
in
the
vast
forever
in
the
science
and
truth
of
being
the
only
facts
are
spirit
and
its
innumerable
creations
darkness
and
chaos
are
the
imaginary
opposites
of
light
understanding
and
eternal
harmony
and
they
are
the
elements
of
nothingness
spiritual
reflection
we
admit
that
black
is
not
a
color
because
it
reflects
no
light
so
evil
should
be
denied
identity
or
power
because
it
has
none
of
the
divine
hues
paul
says
for
the
invisible
things
of
him
from
the
creation
of
the
world
are
clearly
seen
being
stood
by
the
things
that
are
made
romans
i
when
the
substance
of
spirit
appears
in
christian
ence
the
nothingness
of
matter
is
recognized
where
the
spirit
of
god
is
and
there
is
no
place
where
god
is
not
evil
becomes
nothing
the
opposite
of
the
thing
of
spirit
if
there
is
no
spiritual
reflection
then
there
remains
only
the
darkness
of
vacuity
and
not
a
trace
of
heavenly
tints
harmony
from
spirit
nerves
are
an
element
of
the
belief
that
there
is
tion
in
matter
whereas
matter
is
devoid
of
sensation
consciousness
as
well
as
action
is
governed
by
mind
is
in
god
the
origin
and
ernor
of
all
that
science
reveals
material
sense
has
its
realm
apart
from
science
in
the
unreal
harmonious
action
proceeds
from
spirit
god
inharmony
has
no
principle
its
action
is
erroneous
and
presupposes
man
to
be
in
matter
inharmony
would
make
matter
the
cause
as
well
as
the
effect
of
intelligence
or
soul
thus
attempting
to
separate
mind
from
god
evil
man
is
not
god
and
god
is
not
man
again
god
or
good
never
made
man
capable
of
sin
it
is
the
site
of
good
that
is
evil
which
seems
to
make
men
capable
of
hence
evil
is
but
an
illusion
and
it
has
no
real
basis
evil
is
a
false
belief
god
is
not
its
author
the
supposititious
parent
of
evil
is
a
lie
vapor
and
nothingness
the
bible
declares
all
things
were
made
by
him
the
divine
word
and
without
him
was
not
anything
made
that
was
made
this
is
the
eternal
verity
of
divine
science
if
sin
sickness
death
were
understood
as
nothingness
they
would
appear
as
vapor
melts
before
the
sun
so
evil
would
vanish
before
the
reality
of
good
one
must
hide
the
other
how
important
then
to
choose
good
as
the
reality
man
is
tributary
to
god
spirit
and
to
nothing
else
god
being
is
infinity
freedom
harmony
and
boundless
bliss
where
the
spirit
of
the
lord
is
there
is
liberty
like
the
archpriests
of
yore
man
is
free
to
enter
into
the
holiest
the
realm
of
god
the
fruit
forbidden
material
sense
never
helps
mortals
to
understand
spirit
god
through
spiritual
sense
only
man
prehends
and
loves
deity
the
various
tradictions
of
the
science
of
mind
by
the
terial
senses
do
not
change
the
unseen
truth
which
mains
forever
intact
the
forbidden
fruit
of
knowledge
against
which
wisdom
warns
man
is
the
testimony
of
error
declaring
existence
to
be
at
the
mercy
of
death
and
good
and
evil
to
be
capable
of
commingling
this
is
the
significance
of
the
scripture
concerning
this
tree
of
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
this
growth
of
material
belief
of
which
it
is
said
in
the
day
that
thou
eatest
thereof
thou
shalt
surely
die
human
hypotheses
first
assume
the
reality
of
sickness
sin
and
death
and
then
assume
the
necessity
of
these
evils
because
of
their
admitted
actuality
these
human
verdicts
are
the
curers
of
all
discord
sense
and
pure
soul
if
soul
sins
it
must
be
mortal
sin
has
the
elements
of
it
can
not
sustain
itself
if
sin
is
supported
god
must
uphold
it
and
this
is
impossible
since
truth
can
not
support
error
soul
is
the
divine
principle
of
man
and
never
sins
hence
the
immortality
of
soul
in
science
we
learn
that
it
is
material
sense
not
soul
which
sins
and
it
will
be
found
that
it
is
the
sense
of
sin
which
is
lost
and
not
a
sinful
soul
when
reading
the
scriptures
the
tion
of
the
word
for
gives
the
exact
meaning
in
a
majority
of
cases
soul
defined
human
thought
has
adulterated
the
meaning
of
the
word
through
the
hypothesis
that
soul
is
both
an
evil
and
a
good
intelligence
resident
in
matter
the
proper
use
of
the
word
can
always
be
gained
by
substituting
the
word
where
the
deific
meaning
is
required
in
other
cases
use
the
word
and
you
will
have
the
scientific
signification
as
used
in
christian
science
soul
is
properly
the
synonym
of
spirit
or
god
but
out
of
science
soul
is
identical
with
sense
with
material
sensation
sonship
of
jesus
is
it
important
to
understand
these
planations
in
order
to
heal
the
sick
it
is
since
christ
is
the
way
and
the
truth
casting
out
all
error
jesus
called
himself
the
son
of
man
but
not
the
son
of
joseph
as
woman
is
but
a
species
of
the
genera
he
was
literally
the
son
of
man
jesus
was
the
highest
human
concept
of
the
perfect
man
he
was
inseparable
from
christ
the
messiah
the
divine
idea
of
god
outside
the
flesh
this
enabled
jesus
to
demonstrate
his
trol
over
matter
angels
announced
to
the
wisemen
of
old
this
dual
appearing
and
angels
whisper
it
through
faith
to
the
hungering
heart
in
every
age
sickness
erroneous
sickness
is
part
of
the
error
which
truth
casts
out
error
will
not
expel
error
christian
science
is
the
law
of
truth
which
heals
the
sick
on
the
basis
of
the
one
mind
or
god
it
can
heal
in
no
other
way
since
the
human
mortal
mind
is
not
a
healer
but
causes
the
belief
in
disease
true
healing
transcendent
then
comes
the
question
how
do
drugs
hygiene
and
animal
magnetism
heal
it
may
be
affirmed
that
they
do
not
heal
but
only
relieve
suffering
rarily
exchanging
one
disease
for
another
we
classify
disease
as
error
which
nothing
but
truth
or
mind
can
heal
and
this
mind
must
be
divine
not
human
mind
transcends
all
other
power
and
will
ultimately
persede
all
other
means
in
healing
in
order
to
heal
by
science
you
must
not
be
ignorant
of
the
moral
and
itual
demands
of
science
nor
disobey
them
moral
rance
or
sin
affects
your
demonstration
and
hinders
its
approach
to
the
standard
in
christian
science
terms
adopted
by
the
author
after
the
author
sacred
discovery
she
affixed
the
name
science
to
christianity
the
name
error
to
corporeal
sense
and
the
name
substance
to
mind
science
has
called
the
world
to
battle
over
this
issue
and
its
demonstration
which
heals
the
sick
destroys
error
and
reveals
the
universal
harmony
to
those
natural
christian
scientists
the
cient
worthies
and
to
christ
jesus
god
certainly
revealed
the
spirit
of
christian
science
if
not
the
absolute
letter
science
the
way
because
the
science
of
mind
seems
to
bring
into
honor
the
ordinary
scientific
schools
which
wrestle
with
material
observations
alone
this
science
has
met
with
opposition
but
if
any
system
honors
god
it
ought
to
receive
aid
not
opposition
from
all
ing
persons
and
christian
science
does
honor
god
as
no
other
theory
honors
him
and
it
does
this
in
the
way
of
his
appointing
by
doing
many
wonderful
works
through
the
divine
name
and
nature
one
must
fulfil
one
mission
without
timidity
or
dissimulation
for
to
be
well
done
the
work
must
be
done
unselfishly
christianity
will
never
be
based
on
a
divine
principle
and
so
found
to
be
unerring
until
its
absolute
science
is
reached
when
this
is
accomplished
neither
pride
prejudice
bigotry
nor
envy
can
wash
away
its
foundation
for
it
is
built
upon
the
rock
christ
mindless
methods
does
christian
science
or
metaphysical
healing
include
medication
material
hygiene
ism
hypnotism
theosophy
or
spiritualism
not
one
of
them
is
included
in
it
in
vine
science
the
supposed
laws
of
matter
yield
to
the
law
of
mind
what
are
termed
natural
science
and
material
laws
are
the
objective
states
of
mortal
mind
the
physical
universe
expresses
the
conscious
and
unconscious
thoughts
of
mortals
physical
force
and
mortal
mind
are
one
drugs
and
hygiene
oppose
the
supremacy
of
the
divine
mind
drugs
and
inert
matter
are
unconscious
mindless
tain
results
supposed
to
proceed
from
drugs
are
really
caused
by
the
faith
in
them
which
the
false
human
sciousness
is
educated
to
feel
animal
magnetism
error
mesmerism
is
mortal
material
illusion
animal
netism
is
the
voluntary
or
involuntary
action
of
error
in
all
its
forms
it
is
the
human
antipode
of
divine
science
science
must
triumph
over
material
sense
and
truth
over
error
thus
putting
an
end
to
the
hypotheses
involved
in
all
false
theories
and
practices
error
only
ephemeral
is
materiality
the
concomitant
of
uality
and
is
material
sense
a
necessary
preliminary
to
the
understanding
and
expression
of
spirit
if
error
is
necessary
to
define
or
to
reveal
truth
the
answer
is
yes
but
not
otherwise
is
an
absurd
phrase
for
matter
has
no
sensation
science
declares
that
mind
not
matter
sees
hears
feels
speaks
whatever
contradicts
this
statement
is
the
false
sense
which
ever
betrays
mortals
into
sickness
sin
and
death
if
the
tant
and
evil
appear
only
soon
to
disappear
because
of
their
uselessness
or
their
iniquity
then
these
eral
views
of
error
ought
to
be
obliterated
by
truth
why
malign
christian
science
for
instructing
mortals
how
to
make
sin
disease
and
death
appear
more
and
more
unreal
scientific
translations
emerge
gently
from
matter
into
spirit
think
not
to
thwart
the
spiritual
ultimate
of
all
things
but
come
naturally
into
spirit
through
better
health
and
morals
and
as
the
result
of
spiritual
growth
not
death
but
the
understanding
of
life
makes
man
mortal
the
belief
that
life
can
be
in
matter
or
soul
in
body
and
that
man
springs
from
dust
or
from
an
egg
is
the
result
of
the
mortal
error
which
christ
or
truth
destroys
by
fulfilling
the
spiritual
law
of
being
in
which
man
is
perfect
even
as
the
father
which
is
in
heaven
is
perfect
if
thought
yields
its
dominion
to
other
powers
it
can
not
outline
on
the
body
its
own
beautiful
images
but
it
effaces
them
and
delineates
foreign
agents
called
disease
and
sin
material
beliefs
the
heathen
gods
of
mythology
controlled
war
and
agriculture
as
much
as
nerves
control
sensation
or
muscles
measure
strength
to
say
that
strength
is
in
matter
is
like
saying
that
the
power
is
in
the
lever
the
notion
of
any
life
or
gence
in
matter
is
without
foundation
in
fact
and
you
can
have
no
faith
in
falsehood
when
you
have
learned
falsehood
true
nature
sense
soul
suppose
one
accident
happens
to
the
eye
another
to
the
ear
and
so
on
until
every
corporeal
sense
is
quenched
what
is
man
remedy
to
die
that
he
may
regain
these
senses
even
then
he
must
gain
spiritual
understanding
and
spiritual
sense
in
order
to
possess
immortal
consciousness
earth
preparatory
school
must
be
improved
to
the
utmost
in
reality
man
never
dies
the
belief
that
he
dies
will
not
establish
his
scientific
harmony
death
is
not
the
result
of
truth
but
of
error
and
one
error
will
not
correct
another
death
an
error
jesus
proved
by
the
prints
of
the
nails
that
his
body
was
the
same
immediately
after
death
as
before
if
death
restores
sight
sound
and
strength
to
man
then
death
is
not
an
enemy
but
a
better
friend
than
life
alas
for
the
blindness
of
belief
which
makes
harmony
conditional
upon
death
and
matter
and
yet
supposes
mind
unable
to
produce
harmony
so
long
as
this
error
of
belief
remains
mortals
will
continue
tal
in
belief
and
subject
to
chance
and
change
permanent
sensibility
sight
hearing
all
the
spiritual
senses
of
man
are
eternal
they
can
not
be
lost
their
reality
and
tality
are
in
spirit
and
understanding
not
in
matter
hence
their
permanence
if
this
were
not
so
man
would
be
speedily
annihilated
if
the
five
corporeal
senses
were
the
medium
through
which
to
understand
god
then
palsy
blindness
and
deafness
would
place
man
in
a
terrible
situation
where
he
would
be
like
those
having
no
hope
and
without
god
in
the
world
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
these
calamities
often
drive
mortals
to
seek
and
to
find
a
higher
sense
of
ness
and
existence
exercise
of
life
is
deathless
life
is
the
origin
and
ultimate
of
man
never
attainable
through
death
but
gained
by
ing
in
the
pathway
of
truth
both
before
and
after
that
which
is
called
death
there
is
more
christianity
in
seeing
and
hearing
spiritually
than
materially
there
is
more
science
in
the
perpetual
exercise
of
the
than
in
their
loss
lost
they
can
not
be
while
mind
remains
the
apprehension
of
this
gave
sight
to
the
blind
and
hearing
to
the
deaf
turies
ago
and
it
will
repeat
the
wonder
understanding
belief
you
speak
of
belief
who
or
what
is
it
that
believes
spirit
is
this
precludes
the
need
of
believing
matter
can
not
believe
and
mind
understands
the
body
can
not
believe
the
believer
and
belief
are
one
and
are
mortal
christian
evidence
is
founded
on
science
or
demonstrable
truth
flowing
from
immortal
mind
and
there
is
in
reality
no
such
thing
as
mind
mere
belief
is
blindness
without
principle
from
which
to
plain
the
reason
of
its
hope
the
belief
that
life
is
tient
and
intelligent
matter
is
erroneous
the
apostle
james
said
show
me
thy
faith
without
thy
works
and
i
will
show
thee
my
faith
by
my
works
the
understanding
that
life
is
god
spirit
lengthens
our
days
by
strengthening
our
trust
in
the
deathless
reality
of
life
its
almightiness
and
immortality
confirmation
by
healing
this
faith
relies
upon
an
understood
principle
this
principle
makes
whole
the
diseased
and
brings
out
the
enduring
and
harmonious
phases
of
things
the
result
of
our
teachings
is
their
sufficient
confirmation
when
on
the
strength
of
these
instructions
you
are
able
to
banish
a
severe
malady
the
cure
shows
that
you
understand
this
teaching
and
therefore
you
ceive
the
blessing
of
truth
belief
and
firm
trust
the
hebrew
and
greek
words
often
translated
differ
somewhat
in
meaning
from
that
conveyed
by
the
english
verb
they
have
more
the
nificance
of
faith
understanding
trust
stancy
firmness
hence
the
scriptures
often
appear
in
our
common
version
to
approve
and
endorse
belief
when
they
mean
to
enforce
the
necessity
of
understanding
all
faculties
from
mind
do
the
five
corporeal
senses
constitute
man
christian
science
sustains
with
immortal
proof
the
impossibility
of
any
material
sense
and
defines
these
senses
as
the
testimony
of
which
can
not
be
true
either
of
man
or
of
his
maker
the
corporeal
senses
can
take
no
cognizance
of
spiritual
reality
and
immortality
nerves
have
no
more
sensation
apart
from
what
belief
stows
upon
them
than
the
fibres
of
a
plant
mind
alone
possesses
all
faculties
perception
and
comprehension
therefore
mental
endowments
are
not
at
the
mercy
of
organization
and
decomposition
otherwise
the
very
worms
could
unfashion
man
if
it
were
possible
for
the
real
senses
of
man
to
be
injured
soul
could
reproduce
them
in
all
their
perfection
but
they
can
not
be
turbed
nor
destroyed
since
they
exist
in
immortal
mind
not
in
matter
possibilities
of
life
the
less
mind
there
is
manifested
in
matter
the
better
when
the
unthinking
lobster
loses
its
claw
the
claw
grows
again
if
the
science
of
life
were
understood
it
would
be
found
that
the
senses
of
mind
are
never
lost
and
that
matter
has
no
sensation
then
the
human
limb
would
be
replaced
as
readily
as
the
claw
not
with
an
artificial
limb
but
with
the
genuine
one
any
hypothesis
which
supposes
life
to
be
in
matter
is
an
educated
belief
in
infancy
this
belief
is
not
equal
to
guiding
the
hand
to
the
mouth
and
as
consciousness
develops
this
belief
goes
out
yields
to
the
reality
of
everlasting
life
decalogue
disregarded
corporeal
sense
defrauds
and
lies
it
breaks
all
the
commands
of
the
mosaic
decalogue
to
meet
its
own
mands
how
then
can
this
sense
be
the
given
channel
to
man
of
divine
blessings
or
understanding
how
can
man
reflecting
god
be
pendent
on
material
means
for
knowing

seeing
who
dares
to
say
that
the
senses
of
man
can
be
at
one
time
the
medium
for
sinning
against
god
at
another
the
dium
for
obeying
god
an
affirmative
reply
would
tradict
the
scripture
for
the

fountain
sendeth
not
forth
sweet
waters
and
bitter
organic
construction
valueless
the
corporeal
senses
are
the
only
source
of
evil
or
error
christian
science
shows
them
to
be
false
cause
matter
has
no
sensation
and
no
organic
construction
can
give
it
hearing
and
sight
nor
make
it
the
medium
of

outside
the
material
sense
of
things
all
is
harmony
a
wrong
sense
of
god
man
and
creation
is
want
of
sense
mortal
belief
would
have
the
material
senses
sometimes
good
and
sometimes
bad
it
assures
mortals
that
there
is
real
pleasure
in
sin
but
the
grand
truths
of
christian
science
dispute
this
error
an
animal
propensity
is
but
a
product
of
belief
and
this
belief
commits
depredations
on

human

is
an
animal
propensity
not

hence
it
can
not

stubborn

from
this
cooperation
arises

evil
from
this

comes
its

since
all

mortals
are

deprived
of

human
theories
are
helpless
to
make
man
harmonious
or
immortal
since
he
is
so
already
according
to
christian
science
our
only
need
is
to
know
this
and
reduce
to

the
real

true
nature

quench

not
prophesyings
human
belief

would
by
fair
logic
hilate
man
along
with
the
dissolving
elements
of
clay
the
scientifically
christian
explanations
of
the
nature
and
origin
of
man
destroy
all
material

with
immortal

this
immortal
testimony
ushers
in

which
can
be
obtained
in
no

sleep
shows

under
the

all

it
is
only
by
acknowledging
the

of

which
annuls
the
claims
of

that
mortals
can
lay
off
mortality
and
find
the
indissoluble
spiritual
link
which
establishes
man
forever
in
the

inseparable
from

material
man
as
a

are
one
that

awake
at

time
and
asleep
at
another
times
presenting
no

this
belief
culminates
in
another
belief
that

science
reveals

man
as
never
the

the

or
belief
goes
on
whether
our

they

they

apparently
with

sonality

not
the

of

a
wicked
man
may
have

spiritual
existence
the
one
fact
when
we
are
awake
we
dream
of
the
pains
and
ures
of

who
will
say
even
though
he
does
not
understand
christian
science
that
this
dream
rather
than
the
dreamer
may
not
be
mortal
man
who
can
rationally
say
otherwise
when
the
dream
leaves
mortal
man
intact
in
body
and
thought
although
the
dreamer
is
unconscious
for
right
reasoning
there
should
be
but
one
fact
before
the
thought
namely
spiritual
existence
in
reality
there
is
no
other
existence
since
life
can
not
be
united
to
its
unlikeness
mortality
mind
one
and
all

is
holiness
harmony
immortality
it
is
already
proved
that
a
knowledge
of
this
even
in
small
degree
will
uplift
the
physical
and
moral
standard
of
mortals
will
increase
longevity
will
purify
and
elevate
character
thus
progress
will
finally
destroy
all
error
and
bring
immortality
to
light
we
know
that
a
statement
proved
to
be
good
must
be
correct
new
thoughts
are
constantly
obtaining
the
floor
these
two
contradictory
theories
that
matter
is
something
or
that
all
is
mind
will
dispute
the
ground
until
one
is
acknowledged
to
be
the
victor
discussing
his
paign
general
grant
said
i
propose
to
fight
it
out
on
this
line
if
it
takes
all
summer
science
says
all
is
mind
and
mind
idea
you
must
fight
it
out
on
this
line
matter
can
afford
you
no
aid
scientific
ultimatum
the
notion
that
mind
and
matter
commingle
in
the
human
illusion
as
to
sin
sickness
and
death
must
tually
submit
to
the
science
of
mind
which
denies
this
notion
is
mind
and
god
is
infinite
hence
all
is
on
this
statement
rests
the
science
of
being
and
the
principle
of
this
science
is
vine
demonstrating
harmony
and
immortality
victory
for
truth
the
conservative
theory
long
believed
is
that
there
are
two
factors
matter
and
mind
uniting
on
some
possible
basis
this
theory
would
keep
truth
and
error
always
at
war
victory
would
perch
on
neither
banner
on
the
other
hand
christian
science
speedily
shows
truth
to
be
triumphant
to
corporeal
sense
the
sun
appears
to
rise
and
set
and
the
earth
to
stand
still
but
astronomical
science
contradicts
this
and
explains
the
solar
system
as
working
on
a
ent
plan
all
the
evidence
of
physical
sense
and
all
the
knowledge
obtained
from
physical
sense
must
yield
to
science
to
the
immortal
truth
of
all
things
mental
preparation
will
you
explain
sickness
and
show
how
it
is
to
be
healed
the
method
of
christian
science
ing
is
touched
upon
in
a
previous
chapter
entitled
christian
science
practice
a
full
answer
to
the
above
question
involves
teaching
which
enables
the
healer
to
demonstrate
and
prove
for
himself
the
principle
and
rule
of
christian
science
or
metaphysical
healing
mind
destroys
all
ills
mind
must
be
found
superior
to
all
the
beliefs
of
the
five
corporeal
senses
and
able
to
destroy
all
ills
ness
is
a
belief
which
must
be
annihilated
by
the
divine
mind
disease
is
an
experience
of
mortal
mind
it
is
fear
made
manifest
on
the
body
christian
science
takes
away
this
physical
sense
of
discord
just
as
it
removes
any
other
sense
of
moral
or
mental
inharmony
that
man
is
material
and
that
ter
suffers
these
propositions
can
only
seem
real
and
natural
in
illusion
any
sense
of
soul
in
matter
is
not
the
reality
of
being
if
jesus
awakened
lazarus
from
the
dream
illusion
of
death
this
proved
that
the
christ
could
improve
on
a
false
sense
who
dares
to
doubt
this
consummate
test
of
the
power
and
willingness
of
divine
mind
to
hold
man
forever
intact
in
his
perfect
state
and
to
govern
man
entire
action
jesus
said
destroy
this
temple
body
and
in
three
days
i
mind
will
raise
it
up
and
he
did
this
for
tired
humanity
reassurance
inexhaustible
divine
love
is
it
not
a
species
of
infidelity
to
believe
that
so
great
a
work
as
the
messiah
was
done
for
himself
or
for
god
who
needed
no
help
from
jesus
example
to
preserve
the
eternal
harmony
but
mortals
did
need
this
help
and
jesus
pointed
the
way
for
them
divine
love
always
has
met
and
always
will
meet
every
human
need
it
is
not
well
to
imagine
that
jesus
strated
the
divine
power
to
heal
only
for
a
select
number
or
for
a
limited
period
of
time
since
to
all
mankind
and
in
every
hour
divine
love
supplies
all
good
reason
and
science
the
miracle
of
grace
is
no
miracle
to
love
jesus
demonstrated
the
inability
of
corporeality
as
well
as
the
infinite
ability
of
spirit
thus
helping
erring
human
sense
to
flee
from
its
own
convictions
and
seek
safety
in
divine
science
reason
rightly
rected
serves
to
correct
the
errors
of
corporeal
sense
but
sin
sickness
and
death
will
seem
real
even
as
the
periences
of
the
sleeping
dream
seem
real
until
the
ence
of
man
eternal
harmony
breaks
their
illusion
with
the
unbroken
reality
of
scientific
being
which
of
these
two
theories
concerning
man
are
you
ready
to
accept
one
is
the
mortal
testimony
changing
dying
unreal
the
other
is
the
eternal
and
real
evidence
bearing
truth
signet
its
lap
piled
high
with
immortal
fruits
followers
of
jesus
our
master
cast
out
devils
evils
and
healed
the
sick
it
should
be
said
of
his
followers
also
that
they
cast
fear
and
all
evil
out
of
themselves
and
others
and
heal
the
sick
god
will
heal
the
sick
through
man
whenever
man
is
governed
by
god
truth
casts
out
error
now
as
surely
as
it
did
nineteen
centuries
ago
all
of
truth
is
not
understood
hence
its
healing
power
is
not
fully
demonstrated
destruction
of
all
evil
if
sickness
is
true
or
the
idea
of
truth
you
can
not
destroy
sickness
and
it
would
be
absurd
to
try
then
classify
sickness
and
error
as
our
master
did
when
he
spoke
of
the
sick
whom
satan
hath
bound
and
find
a
sovereign
antidote
for
error
in
the
giving
power
of
truth
acting
on
human
belief
a
power
which
opens
the
prison
doors
to
such
as
are
bound
and
sets
the
captive
free
physically
and
morally
steadfast
and
calm
trust
when
the
illusion
of
sickness
or
sin
tempts
you
cling
steadfastly
to
god
and
his
idea
allow
nothing
but
his
likeness
to
abide
in
your
thought
let
neither
fear
nor
doubt
overshadow
your
clear
sense
and
calm
trust
that
the
recognition
of
life
harmonious
as
life
eternally
is
can
destroy
any
painful
sense
of
or
belief
in
that
which
life
is
not
let
christian
science
instead
of
corporeal
sense
support
your
understanding
of
being
and
this
understanding
will
supplant
error
with
truth
replace
mortality
with
immortality
and
silence

with
harmony
rudiments
and
growth
how
can
i
progress
most
rapidly
in
the
understanding
of
christian
science
study
thoroughly
the
letter
and
imbibe
the
spirit
adhere
to
the
divine
principle
of
tian
science
and
follow
the
behests
of
god
abiding
steadfastly
in
wisdom
truth
and
love
in
the
science
of
mind
you
will
soon
ascertain
that
error
can
not
destroy
error
you
will
also
learn
that
in
science
there
is
no
transfer
of
evil
suggestions
from
one
mortal
to
another
for
there
is
but
one
mind
and
this
omnipotent
mind
is
reflected
by
man
and
governs
the
entire
universe
you
will
learn
that
in
christian
science
the
first
duty
is
to
obey
god
to
have
one
mind
and
to
love
another
as
yourself
condition
of
progress
we
all
must
learn
that
life
is
god
ask
yourself
am
i
living
the
life
that
approaches
the
supreme
good
am
i
demonstrating
the
healing
power
of
truth
and
love
if
so
then
the
way
will
grow
brighter
unto
the
perfect
day
your
fruits
will
prove
what
the
understanding
of
god
brings
to
man
hold
perpetually
this
thought
that
it
is
the
spiritual
idea
the
holy
ghost
and
christ
which
enables
you
to
demonstrate
with
scientific
certainty
the
rule
of
healing
based
upon
its
divine
principle
love
underlying
lying
and
encompassing
all
true
being
triumph
over
death
the
sting
of
death
is
sin
and
the
strength
of
sin
is
the
law
the
law
of
mortal
belief
at
war
with
the
facts
of
immortal
life
even
with
the
spiritual
law
which
says
to
the
grave
where
is
thy
victory
but
when
this
corruptible
shall
have
put
on
incorruption
and
this
mortal
shall
have
put
on
mortality
then
shall
be
brought
to
pass
the
saying
that
is
written
death
is
swallowed
up
in
victory
have
christian
scientists
any
religious
creed
they
have
not
if
by
that
term
is
meant
doctrinal
beliefs
the
following
is
a
brief
exposition
of
the
important
points
or
religious
tenets
of
christian
science
as
adherents
of
truth
we
take
the
inspired
word
of
the
bible
as
our
sufficient
guide
to
eternal
life
we
acknowledge
and
adore
one
supreme
and
finite
god
we
acknowledge
his
son
one
christ
the
holy
ghost
or
divine
comforter
and
man
in
image
and
likeness
we
acknowledge
god
forgiveness
of
sin
in
the
destruction
of
sin
and
the
spiritual
understanding
that
casts
out
evil
as
unreal
but
the
belief
in
sin
is
ished
so
long
as
the
belief
lasts
we
acknowledge
jesus
atonement
as
the
dence
of
divine
efficacious
love
unfolding
man
unity
with
god
through
christ
jesus
the
and
we
acknowledge
that
man
is
saved
through
christ
through
truth
life
and
love
as
demonstrated
by
the
galilean
prophet
in
healing
the
sick
and
overcoming
sin
and
death
we
acknowledge
that
the
crucifixion
of
jesus
and
his
resurrection
served
to
uplift
faith
to
understand
nal
life
even
the
allness
of
soul
spirit
and
the
ingness
of
matter
and
we
solemnly
promise
to
watch
and
pray
for
that
mind
to
be
in
us
which
was
also
in
christ
jesus
to
do
unto
others
as
we
would
have
them
do
unto
us
and
to
be
merciful
just
and
pure
key
to
the
scriptures
these
things
saith

that

spiritual
interpretation
scientific
interpretation
of
the
scriptures
erly
starts
with
the
beginning
of
the
old
ment
chiefly
because
the
spiritual
import
of
the
word
in
its
earliest
articulations
often
seems
so
smothered
by
the
immediate
context
as
to
require
explication
whereas
the
new
testament
tives
are
clearer
and
come
nearer
the
heart
jesus
lumines
them
showing
the
poverty
of
mortal
existence
but
richly
recompensing
human
want
and
woe
with
spiritual
gain
the
incarnation
of
truth
that
cation
of
wonder
and
glory
which
angels
could
only
whisper
and
which
god
illustrated
by
light
and
mony
is
consonant
with
love
mystery
and
miracle
which
subserve
the
end
of
natural
good
are
explained
by
that
love
for
whose
rest
the
weary
ones
sigh
when
needing
something
more
native
to
their
immortal
cravings
than
the
history
of
perpetual
evil
spiritual
overture
a
second
necessity
for
beginning
with
genesis
is
that
the
living
and
real
prelude
of
the
older
scriptures
is
so
brief
that
it
would
almost
seem
from
the
preponderance
of
unreality
in
the
entire
rative
as
if
reality
did
not
predominate
over
unreality
the
light
over
the
dark
the
straight
line
of
spirit
over
the
mortal
deviations
and
inverted
images
of
the
creator
and
his
creation
deflection
of
being
spiritually
followed
the
book
of
genesis
is
the
history
of
the
untrue
image
of
god
named
a
sinful
mortal
this
deflection
of
being
rightly
viewed
serves
to
suggest
the
proper
reflection
of
god
and
the
spiritual
actuality
of
man
as
given
in
the
first
chapter
of
genesis
even
thus
the
crude
forms
of
human
thought
take
on
higher
symbols
and
significations
when
tifically
christian
views
of
the
universe
appear
ing
time
with
the
glory
of
eternity
in
the
following
exegesis
each
text
is
followed
by
its
spiritual
interpretation
according
to
the
teachings
of
tian

exegesis
i
in
the
beginning
god
created
the
heaven
and
the
earth
ideas
and

the
infinite

no
beginning
this
word
is
employed
to
signify
that
is
the
eternal
ity
and
unity
of
god
and
man
including
the
universe
the
creative
principle
life
truth
and
love
is
god
the
universe
reflects
god
there
is
but
one
creator
and
one
creation
this
tion
consists
of
the
unfolding
of
spiritual
ideas
and
their
identities
which
are
embraced
in
the
infinite
mind
and
forever
reflected
these
ideas
range
from
the
tesimal
to
infinity
and
the
highest
ideas
are
the
sons
and
daughters
of
god
i
and
the
earth
was
without
form
and
void
and
darkness
was
upon
the
face
of
the
deep
and
the
spirit
of
god
moved
upon
the
face
of
the
waters

the

principle
and
idea
constitute
spiritual
mony
heaven
and
eternity
in
the
universe
of
truth
matter
is
unknown
no
supposition
of
error
enters
there
divine
science
the
word
of
god
saith
to
the
darkness
upon
the
face
of
error
god
is
and
the
light
of
love
illumines
the
universe
hence
the
eternal
wonder
that
infinite
space
is
peopled
with
god
ideas
reflecting
him
in
countless
spiritual
forms
i
and
god
said
let
there
be
light
and
there
was
light
mind
idea
faultless
immortal
and
divine
mind
presents
the
idea
of
god
in
light
in
reflection
in
spiritual
and
immortal
forms
of
beauty
and
goodness
but
this
mind
creates
no
element
nor
symbol
of
discord
and
decay
god
creates
neither
erring
thought
mortal
life
mutable
truth
nor
variable
love
i
and
god
saw
the
light
that
it
was
good
and
god
divided
the
light
from
the
darkness
god
spirit
dwelling
in
infinite
light
and
harmony
from
which
emanates
the
true
idea
is
never
reflected
by
aught
but
the
good
i
and
god
called
the
light
day
and
the
darkness
he
called
night
and
the
evening
and
the
ing
were
the
first
day
light
preceding
the
sun
all
questions
as
to
the
divine
creation
being
both
spiritual
and
material
are
answered
in
this
passage
for
though
solar
beams
are
not
yet
included
in
the
record
of
creation
still
there
is
light
this
light
is
not
from
the
sun
nor
from
volcanic
flames
but
it
is
the
revelation
of
truth
and
of
spiritual
ideas
this
also
shows
that
there
is
no
place
where
god
light
is
not
seen
since
truth
life
and
love
fill
immensity
and
are
was
not
this
a
revelation
instead
of
a
creation
evenings
and
mornings
the
successive
appearing
of
god
ideas
is
represented
as
taking
place
on
so
many
and
words
which
indicate
in
the
absence
of
solar
time
spiritually
clearer
views
of
him
views
which
are
not
implied
by
material
darkness
and
dawn
here
we
have
the
explanation
of
another
passage
of
scripture
that
one
day
is
with
the
lord
as
a
thousand
years
the
rays
of
infinite
truth
when
gathered
into
the
focus
of
ideas
bring
light
instantaneously
whereas
a
thousand
years
of
human
doctrines
hypotheses
and
vague
conjectures
emit
no
such
effulgence
spirit
darkness
did
infinite
mind
create
matter
and
call
it
spirit
is
light
and
the
contradiction
of
spirit
is
matter
darkness
and
darkness
obscures
light
rial
sense
is
nothing
but
a
supposition
of
the
absence
of
spirit
no
solar
rays
nor
planetary
revolutions
form
the
day
of
spirit
immortal
mind
makes
its
own
record
but
mortal
mind
sleep
dreams
sin
disease
and
death
have
no
record
in
the
first
chapter
of
genesis
i
and
god
said
let
there
be
a
firmament
in
the
midst
of
the
waters
and
let
it
divide
the
waters
from
the
waters
spiritual
firmament
spiritual
understanding
by
which
human
conception
material
sense
is
separated
from
truth
is
the
firmament
the
divine
mind
not
matter
creates
all
tities
and
they
are
forms
of
mind
the
ideas
of
spirit
apparent
only
as
mind
never
as
mindless
matter
nor
the
material
senses
i
and
god
made
the
firmament
and
divided
the
waters
which
were
under
the
firmament
from
the
waters
which
were
above
the
firmament
and
it
was
so
understanding
imparted
spirit
imparts
the
understanding
which
uplifts
sciousness
and
leads
into
all

the
psalmist
saith
the
lord
on
high
is
mightier
than
the
noise
of
many
waters
yea
than
the
mighty
waves
of
the
sea
spiritual
sense
is
the
discernment
of
spiritual
good
understanding
is
the
line
of
demarcation
between
the
real
and
unreal
spiritual
understanding
unfolds
mind
life
truth
and
love
and
demonstrates
the
divine
sense
giving
the
spiritual
proof
of
the
universe
in
christian
science
original
reflected
this
understanding
is
not
intellectual
is
not
the
result
of
scholarly
attainments
it
is
the
reality
of
all
things
brought
to
light
god
ideas
reflect
the
mortal
unerring
and
infinite
the
mortal
erring
and
finite
are
human
beliefs
which
apportion
to
themselves
a
task
impossible
for
them
that
of
ing
between
the
false
and
the
true
objects
utterly
like
the
original
do
not
reflect
that
original
therefore
matter
not
being
the
reflection
of
spirit
has
no
real
tity
understanding
is
a
quality
of
god
a
quality
which
separates
christian
science
from
supposition
and
makes
truth
final
i
and
god
called
the
firmament
heaven
and
the
evening
and
the
morning
were
the

to

apprehension

at
peace
thus
the
dawn
of
ideas
goes
on
forming
each
successive
stage
of
progress
i
and
god
said
let
the
waters
under
the
heaven
be
gathered
together
unto
one
place
and
let
the
dry
land
appear
and
it
was
so
unfolding
of
thoughts
spirit
god
gathers
unformed
thoughts
into
their
proper
channels
and
unfolds
these
thoughts
even
as
he
opens
the
petals
of
a
holy
purpose
in
order
that
the
purpose
may
appear
i
and
god
called
the
dry

the

that
it

here
the
human
concept
and
divine
idea
seem
fused
by
the
translator
but
they
are
not
so
in
the
tifically
christian
meaning
of
the
text
upon
adam
devolved
the
pleasurable
task
of
ing
names
for
all
material
things
but
adam

not

appeared
in
the

spirit
duly
feeds

it

and
motherhood
of

all
without

be
full
of

from

after
his

and
it
was
so
divine
propagation
the
universe
of
spirit
reflects
the
creative
power
of
the
divine

and
governs
the
tiplication
of
the
compound
idea
man
the
tree

not

because
they

a
mortal

the
scientific

all

the

mortal
sense
inverts
this
appearing
and
calls
ideas
rial
thus
misinterpreted
the
divine
idea
seems
to
fall
to
the
level
of
a
human
or
material
belief
called
mortal

but
the

this

the
idea
of
the
rarefaction
of
thought
as
it
ascends
higher
god
forms
and
peoples
the
universe
the
light
of
spiritual

gives
gleams
of
the
infinite
only
even
as
nebulae

the
immensity
of

divine

appearing
mineral
vegetable
and
animal
substances
are
no

or

than
they
were

sang
together
mind
made
the
plant
of
the
field
before
it
was
in
the
earth
the
periods
of
spiritual
ascension
are
the
days
and
seasons
of
creation
in
which
beauty
sublimity
purity
and
holiness
yea
the
divine
nature
appear
in
man
and
the
verse
never
to
disappear
spiritual
ideas
apprehended

the
science
of

in
which
all
is

its
ideas

rebuked

of

ye
can
discern
the
face
of
the
sky
but
can
ye
not
discern
the
signs
of
the
times
how
much
more
should
we
seek
to
apprehend
the
ual
ideas
of
god
than
to
dwell
on
the
objects
of
sense
to
discern
the
rhythm
of
spirit
and
to
be
holy
thought
must
be
purely
spiritual
i
and
let
them
be
for
lights
in
the
ment
of
the
heaven
to
give
light
upon
the
earth
and
it
was
so
truth
and
love
enlighten
the
understanding
in
whose
light
shall
we
see
light
and
this
illumination
is
flected
spiritually
by
all
who
walk
in
the
light
and
turn
away
from
a
false
material
sense
i
and
god
made
two
great
lights
the
greater
light
to
rule
the
day
and
the
lesser
light
to
rule
the
night
he
made
the
stars
also
geology
a
failure
the
sun
is
a
metaphorical
representation
of
soul
side
the
body
giving
existence
and
intelligence
to
the
universe
love
alone
can
impart
the
less
idea
of
infinite
mind
geology
has
never
explained
the
earth
formations
it
can
not
explain
them
there
is
no
scriptural
allusion
to
solar
light
until
time
has
been
already
divided
into
evening
and
morning
and
the
allusion
to
fluids
genesis
i
indicates
a
supposed
mation
of
matter
by
the
resolving
of
fluids
into
solids
analogous
to
the
suppositional
resolving
of
thoughts
into
material
things
spiritual
subdivision
light
is
a
symbol
of
mind
of
life
truth
and
love
and
not
a
vitalizing
property
of
matter
ence
reveals
only
one
mind
and
this
one
ing
by
its
own
light
and
governing
the
universe
including
man
in
perfect
harmony
this
mind
forms
ideas
its
own
images
subdivides
and
radiates
their
borrowed
light
intelligence
and
so
explains
the
scripture
phrase
whose
seed
is
in
itself
thus
god
ideas
multiply
and
plenish
the
earth
the
divine
mind
supports
the
limity
magnitude
and
infinitude
of
spiritual
creation
i
and
god
set
them
in
the
firmament
of
the
heaven
to
give
light
upon
the
earth
and
to
rule
over
the
day
and
over
the
night
and
to
divide
the
light
from
the
darkness
and
god
saw
that
it
was
good
darkness
scattered
in
divine
science
which
is
the
seal
of
deity
and
has
the
impress
of
heaven
god
is
revealed
as
finite
light
in
the
eternal
mind
no
night
is
there
i
and
the
evening
and
the
morning
were
the
fourth
day
the
changing
glow
and
full
effulgence
of
god
nite

mark
the
periods
of
progress

and
god
said
let
the
waters
bring
forth
abundantly
the
moving
creature
that
hath
life
and
fowl
that
may
fly
above
the
earth
in

stand
for

metaphorically
present
the
gradation
of
mortal
thought
rising
in
the
scale
of
intelligence
taking
form
in
masculine
feminine
or
neuter
gender
the
fowls
which
fly
above
the
earth
in
the
open
firmament
of
heaven
correspond
to
aspirations
soaring
beyond
and
above
corporeality
to
the
understanding
of
the
incorporeal
and
divine
principle
love
i
and
god
created
great
whales
and
every
living
creature
that
moveth
which
the
waters
brought
forth
abundantly
after
their
kind
and
every
winged
fowl
after
his
kind

god
saw
that
it
was
good
seraphic
symbols
spirit
is
symbolized
by
strength
presence
and
power
and
also
by
holy
thoughts
winged
with
love
these
gels
of
his
presence
which
have
the
holiest
charge
abound
in
the
spiritual
atmosphere
of
mind
and
consequently
reproduce
their
own
istics
their
individual
forms
we
know
not
but
we
do
know
that
their
natures
are
allied
to
god
nature
and
spiritual
blessings
thus
typified
are
the
externalized
yet
subjective
states
of
faith
and
spiritual
understanding
i
and
god
blessed
them
saying
be
ful
and
multiply
and
fill
the

in

seas
and
let

multiply
in
the

multiplication
of

blesses
the
multiplication

own
pure
and
perfect
ideas
from
the
infinite
elements
of
the
one
mind

all
form
color
quality
and
quantity
and
these
are
mental
both
primarily
and
secondarily
their
spiritual
nature
is
discerned
only
through
the
spiritual
senses
mortal
mind
inverts
the
true
likeness
and
confers
animal
names
and
natures
upon
its
own
misconceptions
ignorant
of
the
origin
and
tions
of
mortal
mind
that
is
ignorant
of
itself
this
mind
puts
forth
its
own
qualities
and
claims
god
as
their
author
albeit
god
is
ignorant
of
the
istence
of
both
this
mortal
mentality
and
its
claim
for
the
claim
usurps
the
deific
prerogatives
and
is
an
attempted
infringement
on
infinity

the
evening
and
the
morning
were

spheres
advancing
spiritual
steps
in

teeming
universe
of

on
to

spheres
and
exalted

this

universe
is
dim
and
distant
gray
in
the
sombre
hues
of
twilight
but
anon
the
veil
is
lifted
and
the
scene
shifts
into
light
in
the
record
time
is
not
yet
measured
by
solar
revolutions
and
the
motions
and
reflections
of
deific
power
can
not
be
apprehended
until
divine
science
becomes
the
interpreter
i
and
god
said
let
the
earth
bring
forth
the
living
creature
after
his
kind
cattle
and

thing
and

it

continuity
of

diversifies
classifies
and
individualizes
all
thoughts
which
are
as
eternal
as
the
mind
conceiving
them
but
the
intelligence

and
continuity
of
all
individuality
remain
in
god
who
is
the
divinely
creative

the
earth
after
his
kind
and
cattle
after
their
kind
and
everything
that
creepeth
upon
the
earth
after
his

god
saw
that
it
was
good
god
thoughts
are
spiritual
realities
god
creates
all
forms
of

his
thoughts
are
spiritual
realities
mortal

existent

consequently
not
within
the
range
of

existence
could
not
by
simulating
deific
power
invert
the
divine
creation
and
afterwards
recreate
sons
or
things
upon
its

all

a
realization
of
this
grand
verity

a
source
of
strength
to
the
ancient
worthies
it
supports
christian
healing

enables
its

neither
subtle
nor

its
adroitness

the

elohim
is
in
the
plural
but
this
plurality
of

not

now
compare
man
before
the
mirror
to
his
divine
principle
god
call
the
mirror
divine
science
and
call
man
the
reflection
then
note
how
true
according
to
christian
science
is
the
reflection
to
its
original
as
the
reflection
of
yourself
appears
in
the
mirror
so
you
being
spiritual
are
the
reflection
of
god
the
substance
life
intelligence
truth
and
love
which
constitute
deity
are
reflected
by
his
creation
and
when
we
subordinate
the
false
testimony
of
the
corporeal
senses
to
the
facts
of
science
we
shall
see
this
true

he
him
male

created
he
them
ideal
man

to
emphasize
this
momentous
thought
it
is
repeated
that
god
made
man
in
his
own
image
to
reflect
the
divine
spirit
it
follows
that
man
is
a
generic
term
masculine
feminine
and
neuter
ders
are
human
concepts
in
one
of
the
ancient
guages
the
word
for
is
used
also
as
the
synonym
of
this
definition
has
been
weakened
by
morphism
or
a
humanization
of
deity
the
word
in
such
a
phrase
as
an
anthropomorphic
god
is
derived
from
two
greek
words
signifying
and
and
may
be
defined
as
a
mortally
mental
tempt
to
reduce
deity
to
corporeality
the
quality
of
mind
is
spirit
not
matter
the
ideal
man
corresponds
to
creation
to
intelligence
and
to
truth
the
ideal
woman
corresponds
to
life
and
to
love
in
divine
science
we
have
not
as
much
authority
for
sidering
god
masculine
as
we
have
for
considering
him
feminine
for
love
imparts
the
clearest
idea
of
deity
divine
personality
the
world
believes
in
many
persons
but
if
god
is
sonal
there
is
but
one
person
because
there
is
but
one
god
his
personality
can
only
be
reflected
not
transmitted
god
has
countless
ideas
and
they
all
have
one
principle
and
parentage
the
only
proper
symbol
of
god
as
person
is
mind
infinite
ideal
what
is
this
ideal
who
shall
behold
it
this
ideal
is
god
own
image
spiritual
and
infinite
even
eternity
can
never
reveal
the
whole
of
god
since
there
is
no
limit
to
infinitude
or
to
its
reflections
i
and
god
blessed
them
and
god
said
unto
them
be
fruitful
and
multiply
and
replenish
the
earth
and
subdue
it
and
have
dominion
over
the
fish
of
the
sea
and
over
the
fowl
of
the
air
and
over
every
living
thing
that
moveth
upon
the
earth
birthright
of
man
divine
love
blesses
its
own
ideas
and
causes
them
to
multiply
to
manifest
his
power
man
is
not
made
to
till
the
soil
his
birthright
is
dominion
not
jection
he
is
lord
of
the
belief
in
earth
and
heaven
himself
subordinate
alone
to
his
maker
this
is
the
science
of
being
i
and
god
said
behold
i
have
given
you
every
herb
bearing
seed
which
is
upon
the
face
of
all
the
earth
and
every
tree

wherein
there
is

i
have
given
every
green

for
meat
and
it
was
so
assistance
in
brotherhood
god
gives
the
lesser
idea
of
himself
for
a
link
to
the
greater

in
return
the
higher
always
protects
the
lower

grand

seeth
his

supplieth
it

immortality
and
goodness
which
shine
through
all

all
the

god
saw
everything
that
he
had
made
and
behold
it
was
very
good
and
the
evening
and
the
morning
were
the
sixth

perfection
of
creation
the
divine
principle
or
spirit
comprehends
and
presses
all
and
all
must
therefore
be
as
perfect
is
the
divine
principle
is
perfect
nothing
is
new
to
spirit
nothing
can
be
novel
to
eternal

the
author
of
all
things
who
from
all
eternity
knoweth
his
own

deity
was
satisfied
with
his
work
how
could
he
be
otherwise
since
the
spiritual
creation
was
the
outgrowth
the
emanation
of
his
infinite
containment
and
immortal
wisdom
ii
thus
the
heavens
and
the
earth
were
finished
and
all
the
host
of
them
infinity
measureless
thus
the
ideas
of
god
in
universal
being
are
complete
and
forever
expressed
for
science
reveals
infinity
and
the
fatherhood
and
motherhood
of
love
man
capacity
is
slow
to
discern
and
to
grasp
god
creation
and
the
divine
power
and
presence
which
go
with
it
demonstrating
its
spiritual
origin
mortals
can
never
know
the
infinite
until
they
throw
off
the
old
man
and
reach
the
spiritual
image
and
likeness
what
can
fathom
infinity
how
shall
we
declare
him
till
in
the
language
of
the
apostle
we
all
come
in
the
unity
of
the
faith

of

knowledge

unto
a
perfect
man
unto
the

on

ended
his

from
all
his

ii
these
are
the
generations
of
the
heavens
and
of
the
earth
when
they
were
created
in
the
day
that
the
lord
god
jehovah
made
the
earth
and
the
heavens
and
every
plant
of
the
field
before
it
was
in
the
earth
and
every
herb
of
the

before
it
grew
for
the
lord

jehovah
had
not
caused
it
to
rain
upon
the
earth
and
there
was
not
a
man
to
till
the
ground
growth
is
from

here
is
the
emphatic
declaration
that
god
creates
all
through
mind
not
through
matter
that
the
plant
grows
not
because
of
seed
or
soil
but
because
growth
is
the
eternal
mandate
of

thought
drops
into

but
the

is

not
from

because

makes

there
is
nothing
left
to
be
made
by
a

spirit
acts
through
the
science
of

never
causing

to
till

making

this
lifts

above
the

above

its

spiritual
narrative
here
the
inspired
record
closes
its
narrative
of
being
that
is
without
beginning
or
end
all
that
is
made
is
the
work
of
god
and
all
is
good
we
leave
this
brief
glorious
history
of
spiritual
creation
as
stated
in
the
first
chapter
of
genesis
in
the
hands
of
god
not
of
man
in
the
keeping
of
spirit
not
matter
joyfully
acknowledging
now
and
forever
god
supremacy
omnipotence
and
omnipresence
the
harmony
and
immortality
of
man
are
intact
we
should
look
away
from
the
opposite
supposition
that
man
is
created
materially
and
turn
our
gaze
to
the
spiritual
record
of
creation
to
that
which
should
be
engraved
on
the
understanding
and
heart
with
the
point
of
a
diamond
and
the
pen
of
an
angel
the
reader
will
naturally
ask
if
there
is
nothing
more
about
creation
in
the
book
of
genesis
indeed
there
is
but
the
continued
account
is
mortal
and
material
ii
but
there
went
up
a
mist
from
the
earth
and
watered
the
whole
face
of
the
ground
the
story
of
error
the
science
and
truth
of
the
divine
creation
have
been
presented
in
the
verses
already
considered
and
now
the
opposite
error
a
material
view
of
creation
is
to
be
set
forth
the
second
chapter
of
sis
contains
a
statement
of
this
material
view
of
god
and
the
universe
a
statement
which
is
the
exact
opposite
of
scientific
truth
as
before
recorded
the
history
of
error
or
matter
if
veritable
would
set
aside
the
omnipotence
of
spirit
but
it
is
the
false
history
in
contradistinction
to
the
true
the
two
records
the
science
of
the
first
record
proves
the
falsity
of
the
second
if
one
is
true
the
other
is
false
for
they
are
antagonistic
the
first
record
assigns
all
might
and
government
to
god
and
endows
man
out
of
god
perfection
and
power
the
second
record
chronicles
man
as
mutable
and
mortal
as
ing
broken
away
from
deity
and
as
revolving
in
an
orbit
of
his
own
existence
separate
from
divinity
science
explains
as
impossible
this
second
record
unmistakably
gives
the
history
of
error
in
its
externalized
forms
called
life
and
gence
in
matter
it
records
pantheism
opposed
to
the
supremacy
of
divine
spirit
but
this
state
of
things
is
declared
to
be
temporary
and
this
man
to
be
mortal
dust
returning
to

this
erroneous
theory

the

of

glowing
denunciations
of
man
when
not
found
in
his

and
coincide
with

in
declaring
this
material
creation
false
hypothetical
reversal
this
latter
part
of
the
second
chapter
of
genesis
which
portrays
spirit
as
supposedly
cooperating
with
matter
in
constructing
the
universe
is
based
on
some
hypothesis
of
error
for
the
scripture
just
ceding
declares
god

finished
does
life
truth
and
love
produce

the

the
erring
principle
of

law
change
or
repent
it
not
be
so
yet
one
might
so
judge
from
an
unintelligent
perusal
of
the
scriptural
account
now
under
comment
mist
or
false
claim
because
of
its
false
basis
the
mist
of
obscurity
evolved
by
error
deepens
the
false
claim
and
finally
declares
that
god
knows
error
and
that
error
can
improve
his
creation
although
presenting
the
exact
opposite
of

the
lie

the
tions
of

arise
from
a
mist

or
from
mystification

not
from
the

god
erects
between
the
true
and

everything

instead
of

distinct
documents
it
may
be
worth
while
here
to
remark
that
according
to
the
best
scholars
there
are
clear
evidences
of
two
tinct
documents
in
the
early
part
of
the
book
of
genesis
one
is
called
the
elohistic
because
the
supreme
being
is
therein
called
elohim
the
other
document
is
called
the
jehovistic
because
deity
therein
is
always
called
jehovah
or
lord
god
as
our
common
version
translates
it
jehovah
or
elohim
throughout
the
first
chapter
of
genesis
and
in
three
verses
of
the
second
in
what
we
understand
to
be
the
spiritually
scientific
account
of
creation
it
is
elohim
god
who
creates
from
the
fourth
verse
of
chapter
two
to
chapter
five
the
creator
is
called
jehovah
or
the
lord
the
different
accounts
become
more
and
more
closely
intertwined
to
the
end
of
chapter
twelve
after
which
the
distinction
is
not
definitely
able
in
the
historic
parts
of
the
old
testament
it
is
usually
jehovah
peculiarly
the
divine
sovereign
of
the
hebrew
people
who
is
referred
to
gods
of
the
heathen
the
idolatry
which
followed
this
material
mythology
is
seen
in
the
phoenician
worship
of
baal

the
moabitish
god
chemosh
in
the
moloch
of
the
amorites
in
the
hindoo

greek
dite
and
in
a
thousand
other
deities
jehovah
a
tribal
deity
it
was
also
found
among
the
israelites
who
constantly
went
after
strange
gods
they
called
the
supreme
being
by
the
national
name
of
jehovah
in
that
name
of
jehovah
the
true
idea
of
god
seems
almost
lost
god
becomes
a
man
of
war
a
tribal
god
to
be
worshipped
rather
than
love
the
divine
principle
to
be
lived
and
loved
ii
and
the
lord
god
jehovah
formed
man
of
the
dust
of
the
ground
and
breathed
into
his
nostrils
the
breath
of
life
and
man
became
a

did
the
divine

that
he
should
now

no

without
him
the

anything
made
that

god
made
whatever

valueless
or
baneful
he
did
not

hence
its
unreality
in
the
science
of
genesis
we
read
that
he
saw
everything
which
he
had
made
and
behold
it
was
very
good
the
corporeal
senses
declare
otherwise
and
if
we
give
the
same
heed
to
the
history
of
error
as
to
the
records
of
truth
the
scriptural
record
of
sin
and
death
favors
the
false
conclusion
of
the
material
senses
sin
sickness
and
death
must
be
deemed
as
devoid
of
reality
as
they
are
of
good
god
ii
and
out
of
the
ground
made
the
lord
god
jehovah
to
grow
every
tree
that
is
pleasant
to
the
sight
and
good
for
food
the
tree
of

also
in
the
midst
of

garden
and
the
tree
of
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
contradicting
first
creation
the
previous
and
more
scientific
record
of
creation
declares
that
god
made
every
plant
of
the
field
fore
it
was
in
the
earth
this
opposite
declaration
this
statement
that
life
issues
from
matter
contradicts
the
teaching
of
the
first
ter
namely
that
all
life
is

belief
is
less
than

theories
of

sin
sickness
and

follow
in
the
train
of
this
error
of
a
belief
in
intelligent
matter
record
of
error
the
first
mention
of
evil
is
in
the
legendary
scriptural
text
in
the
second
chapter
of
genesis
god
pronounced
good
all
that
he
created
and
the
scriptures
declare
that
he
created
all
the
tree
of
life
stands
for
the
idea
of
truth
and
the
sword
which
guards
it
is
the
type
of
divine
science
the
tree
of
knowledge
stands
for
the
erroneous
doctrine
that
the
knowledge
of
evil
is
as
real
hence
as
as
the
knowledge
of
good
was
evil
instituted
through
god
love
did
he
create
this
of
sin
in
diction
of
the
first
creation
this
second
biblical
account
is
a
picture
of
error
throughout
ii
and
the
lord
god
jehovah
took
the
man
and
put
him
into
the
garden
of
eden
to
dress
it
and
to
keep
it
garden
of
eden
the
name
eden
according
to
cruden
means
in
this
text
eden
stands
for
the
mortal
rial
body
god
could
not
put
mind
into
matter
nor
finite
spirit
into
finite
form
to
dress
it
and
keep
it
to
make
it
beautiful
or
to
cause
it
to
live
and
grow
man
is
god
reflection
needing
no
cultivation
but
ever
beautiful
and
complete
ii
and
the
lord
god
jehovah
manded
the
man
saying
of
every
tree
of
the
garden
thou
mayest
freely
eat
but
of
the
tree
of
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
thou
shalt
not
eat
of
it
for
in
the
day
that
thou
eatest
thereof
thou
shalt
surely
die
no
temptation
from
god
here
the
metaphor
represents
god
love
as
tempting
man
but
the
apostle
james
says
god
can
not
be
tempted
with
evil
neither
tempteth
he
any
man
it
is
true
that
a
knowledge
of
evil
would
make
man
mortal
it
is
plain
also
that
rial
perception
gathered
from
the
corporeal
senses
tutes
evil
and
mortal
knowledge
but
is
it
true
that
god
good
made
the
tree
of
life
to
be
the
tree
of
death
to
his
own
creation
has
evil
the
reality
of
good
evil
is
real
because
it
is
a
lie
false
in
every
statement
ii
and
out
of
the
ground
the
lord
god
jehovah
formed
every
beast
of
the
field
and
every
fowl
of
the
air
and
brought
them
unto
adam
to
see
what
he
would
call
them
and
whatsoever
adam
called
every
living
creature
that
was
the
name
thereof
creation
counterfeit
here
the
lie
represents
god
as
repeating
creation
but
doing
so
materially
not
spiritually
and
ing
a
prospective
sinner
to
help
him
is
the
supreme
being
retrograding
and
is
man
giving
up
his
dignity
was
it
requisite
for
the
formation
of
man
that
dust
should
become
sentient
when
all
being
is
the
reflection
of
the
eternal
mind
and
the
record
declares
that
god
has
already
created
man
both
male
and
female
that
adam
gave
the
name
and
nature
of
animals
is
solely
mythological
and
material
it
not
be
true
that
man
was
ordered
to
create
man
anew
in
partnership
with
god
this
supposition
was
a
dream
a
myth
ii
and
the
lord
god
jehovah
yawah
caused
a
deep
sleep
to
fall
upon
adam
and
he
slept
and
he
took
one
of
his
ribs
and
closed
up
the
flesh
instead
thereof
and
the
rib
which
the
lord
god
jehovah
had
taken
from
man
made
he
a
woman
and
brought
her
unto
the
man
hypnotic
surgery
here
falsity
error
credits
truth
god
with
inducing
a
sleep
or
hypnotic
state
in
adam
in
order
to
perform
a
surgical
operation
on
him
and
thereby
create
woman
this
is
the
first
record
of
ism
beginning
creation
with
darkness
instead
of
light
materially
rather
than
spiritually
error
now
lates
the
work
of
truth
mocking
love
and
ing
what
great
things
error
has
done
beholding
the
creations
of
his
own
dream
and
calling
them
real
and
adam
error
gives
them
names
afterwards
he
is
supposed
to
become
the
basis
of
the
creation
of
woman
and
of
his
own
kind
calling
them
that
is
a
kind
of
man
mental
midwifery
but
according
to
this
narrative
surgery
was
first
formed
mentally
and
without
instruments
and
this
may
be
a
useful
hint
to
the
medical
faculty
later
in
human
history
when
the
forbidden
fruit
was
bringing
forth
fruit
of
its
own
kind
there
came
a
suggestion
of
change
in
the
that
man
should
be
born
of
woman
not
woman
again
taken
from
man
it
came
about
also
that
instruments
were
needed
to
assist
the
birth
of
mortals
the
first
system
of
suggestive
obstetrics
has
changed
another
change
will
come
as
to
the
nature
and
origin
of
man
and
this
revelation
will
destroy
the
of
existence
reinstate
reality
usher
in
science
and
the
glorious
fact
of
creation
that
both
man
and
woman
proceed
from
god
and
are
his
eternal
children
belonging
to
no
lesser
parent
iii
now
the
serpent
was
more
subtle
than
any
beast
of
the
field
which
the
lord
god
jehovah
had
made
and
he
said
unto
the
woman
yea
hath
god
said
ye
shall
not
eat
of
every
tree
of
the
garden
and
the
woman
said
unto
the
serpent
we
may
eat
of
the
fruit
of
the
trees
of
the
garden
but
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
which
is
in
the
midst
of
the

god
hath
said
ye
shall
not
eat
of
it
neither
shall
ye
touch

whence
comes
a

to
tempt

the

as
evil
we
have
nothing
in
the
animal
kingdom
which
represents
the
species
described
a
talking
serpent
and
should
rejoice
that
evil
by
whatever
figure
presented
contradicts
itself
and
has
neither
origin
nor
support
in
truth
and
good
seeing
this
we
should
have

fight
all
claims
of
evil

we
know
that
they
are

unreal
error
or
adam
adam
the
synonym
for

stands
for
a
belief
of
material
mind
he
begins
his
reign
over
man
what
mildly
but
he
increases
in
falsehood
and
his
days
become
shorter
in
this
development
the
mortal
spiritual
law
of

is
made
manifest
as

knowing
this
jesus
once
said
take
no

for
your
life
what
ye
shall
eat
or
what
ye
shall
drink
presuming
not
on
the
prerogative
of
his

recognizing
god
the
father

of

as

error
assumption
this
myth
represents
error
as
always
asserting
its
periority
over
truth
giving
the
lie
to
divine
science
and
saying
through
the
material
senses
i
can
open
your

i
can
do
what
god
has
not
done
for
you
bow
down
to
me
and
have
another

only
admit
that
i
am
real
that
sin
and
sense
are
more
pleasant
to
the
eyes
than
spiritual
life
more
to
be
sired
than

and
i
shall
know
you
and
you
will
be
mine
thus
spirit
and
flesh
war
scriptural
allegory
the
history
of
error
is
a
the
dream
has
no
reality
no
intelligence
no
mind
therefore
the
dreamer
and
dream
are
one
for
neither
is
true
nor
real
this
narrative
supposes
that
something
springs
from
nothing
that
matter
cedes
mind
it
supposes
that
mind
enters
matter
and
matter
becomes
living
substantial
and
intelligent
the
order
of
this
allegory
the
belief
that
everything
springs
from
dust
instead
of
from
deity
has
been
tained
in
all
the
subsequent
forms
of
belief
this
is
the
error
that
mortal
man
starts
materially
that
intelligence
becomes
intelligence
that
mind
and
soul
are
both
right
and
wrong
higher
hope
it
is
well
that
the
upper
portions
of
the
brain
represent
the
higher
moral
sentiments
as
if
hope
were
ever
sying
thus
the
human
mind
will
sometime
rise
above
all
material
and
physical
sense
changing
it
for
spiritual
perception
and
exchanging
man
concepts
for
the
divine
consciousness
then
man
will
recognize
his
dominion
and
being
biological
inventions
if
in
the
beginning
man
body
originated
in
intelligent
dust
and
mind
was
afterwards
put
into
body
by
the
creator
why
is
not
this
divine
order
still
maintained
by
god
in
perpetuating
the
species
who
will
say
that
minerals
vegetables
and
animals
have
a
propagating
property
of
their
own
who
dares
to
say
either
that
god
is
in
matter
or
that
matter
exists
without
god
has
man
sought
out
other
creative
inventions
and
so
changed
the
method
of
his
maker
which
institutes
life
matter
or
mind
does
life
begin
with
mind
or
with
matter
is
life
sustained
by
matter
or
by
spirit
certainly
not
by
both
since
flesh
wars
against
spirit
and
the
corporeal
senses
can
take
no
cognizance
of
spirit
the
mythologic
theory
of
rial
life
at
no
point
resembles
the
scientifically
christian
record
of
man
as
created
by
mind
in
the
image
and
ness
of
god
and
having
dominion
over
all
the
earth
did
god
at
first
create
one
man
unaided
that
is
adam
but
afterwards
require
the
union
of
the
two
sexes
in
order
to
create
the
rest
of
the
human
family
no
god
makes
and
governs
all
progeny
cursed
all
human
knowledge
and
material
sense
must
be
gained
from
the
five
corporeal
senses
is
this
knowledge
safe
when
eating
its
first
fruits
brought
death
in
the
day
that
thou
eatest
thereof
thou
shalt
surely
die
was
the
prediction
in
the
story
under
eration
adam
and
his
progeny
were
cursed
not
blessed
and
this
indicates
that
the
divine
spirit
or
father
demns
material
man
and
remands
him
to
dust
iii
and
the
lord
god
jehovah
called
unto
adam
and
said
unto
him
where
art
thou
and
he
said
i
heard
thy
voice
in
the
garden
and
i
was
afraid
because
i
was
naked
and
i
hid
myself
shame
the
effect
of
sin
knowledge
and
pleasure
evolved
through
material
sense
produced
the
immediate
fruits
of
fear
and
shame
ashamed
before
truth
error
shrank
abashed
from
the
divine
voice
calling
out
to
the
poreal
senses
its
summons
may
be
thus
paraphrased
where
art
thou
man
is
mind
in
matter
is
mind
capable
of
error
as
well
as
of
truth
of
evil
as
well
as
of
good
when
god
is
all
and
he
is
mind
and
there
is
but
one
god
hence
one
mind
fear
comes
of
error
fear
was
the
first
manifestation
of
the
error
of
rial
sense
thus
error
began
and
will
end
the
dream
of
matter
in
the
allegory
the
body
had
been
naked
and
adam
knew
it
not
but
now
error
demands
that
shall
see
and
feel
through
matter
the
five
senses
the
first
impression
material
man
had
of
himself
was
one
of
nakedness
and
shame
had
he
lost
man
rich
inheritance
and
god
behest
dominion
over
all
the
earth
no
this
had
never
been
bestowed
on
adam
iii
and
he
said
who
told
thee
that
thou
wast
naked
hast
thou
eaten
of
the
tree
whereof
i
commanded
thee
that
thou
shouldst
not
eat
and
the
man
said
the
woman
whom
thou
gavest
to
be
with
me
she
gave
me
of
the
tree
and
i
did
eat
the
beguiling
first
lie
here
there
is
an
attempt
to
trace
all
human
errors
directly
or
indirectly
to
god
or
good
as
if
he
were
the
creator
of
evil
the
allegory
shows
that
the
utters
the
first
voluble
lie
which
beguiles
the
woman
and
demoralizes
the
man
adam
mortal
charges
god
and
woman
with
his
own
dereliction
saying
the
woman
whom
thou
gavest
me
is
responsible
according
to
this
belief
the
rib
taken
from
adam
side
has
grown
into
an
evil
mind
named
who
aids
man
to
make
sinners
more
rapidly
than
he
can
alone
is
this
an
help
meet
for
man
materiality
so
obnoxious
to
god
is
already
found
in
the
rapid
deterioration
of
the
bone
and
flesh
which
came
from
adam
to
form
eve
the
belief
in
material
life
and
telligence
is
growing
worse
at
every
step
but
error
has
its
suppositional
day
and
multiplies
until
the
end
thereof
false
womanhood
truth
man
as
to
his
knowledge
of
error
finds
woman
the
first
to
confess
her
fault
she
says
the
serpent
beguiled
me
and
i
did
eat
as
much
as
to
say
in
meek
penitence
neither
man
nor
god
shall
father
my
fault
she
has
already
learned
that
corporeal
sense
is
the
serpent
hence
she
is
first
to
abandon
the
belief
in
the
material
origin
of
man
and
to
discern
spiritual
creation
this
hereafter
enabled
woman
to
be
the
mother
of
jesus
and
to
behold
at
the
sepulchre
the
risen
saviour
who
was
soon
to
fest
the
deathless
man
of
god
creating
this
enabled
woman
to
be
first
to
interpret
the
scriptures
in
their
true
sense
which
reveals
the
spiritual
origin
of
man
iii
and
the
lord
god
jehovah
said
unto
the
serpent
i
will
put
enmity
between
thee
and
the
woman
and
between
thy
seed
and
her
seed
it
shall
bruise
thy
head
and
thou
shalt
bruise
his
heel
spirit
and
flesh
this
prophecy
has
been
fulfilled
the
son
of
the
mother
unfolded
the
remedy
for
adam
or
error
and
the
apostle
paul
explains
this
warfare
between
the
idea
of
divine
power
which
jesus
presented
and
mythological
material
intelligence
called
and
opposed
to
spirit
paul
says
in
his
epistle
to
the
romans
the
carnal
mind
is
enmity
against
god
for
it
is
not
subject
to
the
law
of
god
neither
indeed
can
be
so
then
they
that
are
in
the
flesh
can
not
please
god
but
ye
are
not
in
the
flesh
but
in
the
spirit
if
so
be
that
the
spirit
of
god
dwell
in
you
bruising
sin
head
there
will
be
greater
mental
opposition
to
the
ual
scientific
meaning
of
the
scriptures
than
there
has
ever
been
since
the
christian
era
began
the
serpent
material
sense
will
bite
the
heel
of
the
woman
will
struggle
to
destroy
the
spiritual
idea
of
love
and
the
woman
this
idea
will
bruise
the
head
of
lust
the
spiritual
idea
has
given
the
understanding
a
foothold
in
christian
science
the
seed
of
truth
and
the
seed
of
error
of
belief
and
of
understanding
yea
the
seed
of
spirit
and
the
seed
of
matter
are
the
wheat
and
tares
which
time
will
separate
the
one
to
be
burned
the
other
to
be
garnered
into
heavenly
places
iii
unto
the

said
i

greatly
multiply
thy
sorrow
and
thy
conception
in

thou
shalt
bring
forth
children
and
thy

thy

and
he
shall
rule
over

judgment
on
error
divine
science
deals
its
chief
blow
at
the
supposed
terial
foundations
of
life
and
intelligence
it
dooms
atry
a
belief
in
other
gods
other
creators
and
other
creations
must
go
down
before
tian
science
it
unveils
the
results
of
sin
as
shown
in
sickness

when
will

pass
through
the
open

of
christian
science
into
the

into
the

of
the

is
indeed
the

iii
and
unto
adam
he
said
because
thou
hast
hearkened
unto
the
voice
of
thy

and
hast

and
the
gathering
together
of
the
waters
called

in

i

stand
for

and
the

as
a
symbol
of
human
concepts
advancing
and
receding
is
represented
as
having
passed
away
the
divine
understanding
reigns
is
and
there
is
no
other
consciousness
the
fall
of
error
the
way
of
error
is
awful
to
contemplate
the
sion
of
sin
is
without
hope
or
god
if
man
spiritual
gravitation
and
attraction
to
one
father
in
whom
we
live
and
move
and
have
our
ing
should
be
lost
and
if
man
should
be
governed
by
corporeality
instead
of
divine
principle
by
body
instead
of
by
soul
man
would
be
annihilated
created
by
flesh
instead
of
by
spirit
starting
from
matter
instead
of
from

mortal
man
would
be
governed
by

the

both
would
fall
true

passions
and
appetites
must
end
in
pain
they
are
of

full
of
trouble
their
supposed
joys
are
cheats
their
narrow
limits
belittle
their
tions
and
hedge
about
their
achievements
with
thorns
mortal
mind
accepts
the
erroneous
material
tion
of
life
and
joy
but
the
true
idea
is
gained
from
the
immortal
side
through
toil
struggle
and
row
what
do
mortals
attain
they
give
up
their
belief
in
perishable
life
and

the
mortal

return
to

is
reached
iii
and
the
lord
god
jehovah
said
behold
the
man
is
become
as
one
of
us
to
know
good
and
evil
and
now
lest
he
put
forth
his
hand
and
take
also
of
the
tree
of
life
and
eat
and
live
forever
therefore
the
lord
god
jehovah
sent
him
forth
from
the
garden
of
eden
to
till
the
ground
from
whence
he
was
taken
so
he
drove
out
the
man
and
he
placed
at
the
east
of
the
garden
of
eden
cherubims
and
a
flaming
sword
which
turned
every
way
to
keep
the
way
of
the
tree
of

justice
and
recompense
a
knowledge
of
evil
was
never
the
essence
of
ity
or
manhood
in
the
first
chapter
of

evil
has
no
local
habitation
nor
name
tion
is
there
represented
as
spiritual
entire
and
good
whatsoever
a
man
soweth
that
shall
he
also
reap
error
excludes
itself
from
harmony
sin
is
its
own
punishment
truth
guards
the
gateway
to
harmony
error
tills
its
own
barren
soil
and
buries
itself
in
the
ground
since
ground
and
dust
stand
for
nothingness
inspired
interpretation
no
one
can
reasonably
doubt
that
the
purpose
of
this
allegory
this
second
account
in
genesis
is
to
depict
the
falsity
of
error
and
the
effects
of
error
subsequent
bible
revelation
is
coordinate
with
the
science
of
creation
recorded
in
the
first
chapter
of
genesis
inspired
writers
interpret
the
word
spiritually
while
the
ordinary
historian
interprets
it
literally
literally
taken
the
text
is
made
to
appear
contradictory
in
some
places
and
divine
love
which
blessed
the
earth
and
gave
it
to
man
for
a
possession
is
represented
as
changeable
the
literal
meaning
would
imply
that
god
withheld
from
man
the
opportunity
to
reform
lest
man
should
improve
it
and
become
better
but
this
is
not
the
nature
of
god
who
is
love
always
love
infinitely
wise
and
altogether
lovely
who
seeketh
not
her
own
spiritual
gateway
truth
should
and
does
drive
error
out
of
all
selfhood
truth
is
a
sword
guarding
and
guiding
truth
places
the
cherub
wisdom
at
the
gate
of
understanding
to
note
the
proper
guests
radiant
with
mercy
and
justice
the
sword
of
truth
gleams
afar
and
indicates
the
infinite
distance
between
truth
and
error
between
the
material
and
spiritual
the
unreal
and
the
real
contrasted
testimony
the

heat
to
the

is
a
figure
of
divine
life
and
love
enlightening
and
sustaining
the
universe
the
tree
of
life
is
significant
of
eternal
reality
or
being
the
tree
of
edge
typifies
unreality
the
testimony
of
the
serpent
is
significant
of
the
illusion
of
error
of
the
false
claims
that
misrepresent
god
good
sin
sickness
and
death
have
no
record
in
the
elohistic
introduction
of
genesis
in
which
god
creates
the
heavens
earth
and
man
until
that
which
contradicts
the
truth
of
being
enters
into
the
arena
evil
has
no
history
and
evil
is
brought
into
view
only
as
the
unreal
in
contradistinction
to
the
real
and
eternal
iv
and
adam

his

and
she
conceived
and
bare
cain
and
said
i
have
gotten
a
man
from
the
lord
jehovah
erroneous
conception
this
account
is
given
not
of
immortal
man
but
of
tal
man
and
of
sin
which
is
temporal
as
both
mortal
man
and
sin
have
a
beginning
they
must
consequently
have
an
end
while
the
sinless
real
man
is
eternal

declaration
i
have

from

god
to
be
the

this
false
sense
of
existence
is
fratricidal
in
the
words
of
jesus
it
evil
devil
is
a
murderer
from
the
beginning
error
begins
by
reckoning
life
as
separate
from
spirit
thus
sapping
the
foundations
of
immortality
as
if
life
and
immortality
were
something
which

can
both
give
and
take
away
only
one
standard
what
can
be
the
standard

the

by
condemning
its
symbol
the

to

it
is
false
to
say
that

commingle
in

in
parable
and
argument
this
falsity
is
exposed
by
our
master
as
wrong
disputing
these
points
with
the
pharisees
and
arguing
for
the
science
of

jesus
said

paul
asked
what
munion
hath
light
with
darkness
and
what
concord
hath
christ
with
belial
scientific
offspring
the
divine
origin
of
jesus
gave
him
more
than
human
power
to
expound
the
facts
of

demonstrate
the
one
mind
which
makes
and
governs
man

the

christ

in

the

referred

up

when
bringing

ducing

we
may
think
in

rance
that

uncovers

it

the

shut

from

corporeal
senses

not
take
cognizance
of

they
can
not
come
into

must
dwell

until
mortals
arrive
at
the
understanding
that
terial

with

its

is
an

against
which
divine
science
is
engaged
in
a
warfare
of

the
great
verities
of

are
never
excluded
by
falsity
man
springs
from

all
error
proceeds
from
the
evidence
before
the
rial

if
man
is
material
and
originates
in

who
shall
say
that
he

may
not

that

minerals

to

the

did
man
whom

created
with

did
it
leave
aught
for

alone
are
reflected
in
the

thus
it

that

the

the
text
in
the

that
the

jehovah
god
made
the

introduces
the
record
of

followed

a
creation
so
wholly
apart
from

that
spirit
had
no

there

life

not
from
the

in

not
of
the

which
a

can
not

the
eternal

that

nothing

no

all

even

the
first
statement
about

the
first
suggestion
of
more
than
the

is
in
the
fable
of
the
serpent
the
facts
of
creation
as
previously
corded
include
nothing
of
the
kind
material
personality
the
serpent
is
supposed
to
say
ye
shall
be
as
gods
but
these
gods
must
be
evolved
from
materiality
and
be
the
very
antipodes
of
immortal
and
spiritual
being
man
is
the
likeness
of
spirit
but
a
material
personality
is
not
this
likeness
therefore
man
in
this
allegory
is
neither
a
lesser
god
nor
the
image

likeness
of
the
one
god
material
erroneous
belief
reverses
understanding
and
truth
it
declares

mortal

to

infinity
to
enter
man
nostrils
so
that
matter
becomes
spiritual
error
begins
with
corporeality
as
the
producer
instead
of
divine
ciple
and
explains
deity
through
mortal
and
finite
ceptions
behold
the
man
is
become
as
one
of
us
this
could
not
be
the
utterance
of
truth
or
science
for
according
to
the
record
material
man
was
fast
degenerating
and
never
had
been
divinely
conceived
mental
tillage
the
condemnation
of
mortals
to
till
the
ground
means
this
that
mortals
should
so
improve
material
belief
by
thought
tending
spiritually
upward
as
to
destroy
materiality
man
created
by
god
was
given
dominion
over
the
whole
earth
the
notion
of
a
material
universe
is
utterly
opposed
to
the
theory
of
man
as
evolved
from

such
fundamental
errors
send
falsity
into
all
human
doctrines
and
conclusions
and
do
not
accord
infinity
to
deity
error
tills
the
whole
ground
in
this
material
theory
which
is
entirely
a
false
view
destructive
to
existence
and
happiness
side
of
christian
science
all
is
vague
and
hypothetical
the
opposite
of
truth
yet
this
opposite
in
its
false
view
of
god
and
man
impudently
demands
a
blessing
erroneous
standpoint
the
translators
of
this
record
of
scientific
creation
entertained
a
false
sense
of
being
they
believed
in
the
existence
of
matter
its
propagation
and
power
from
that
standpoint
of
error
they
could
not
apprehend
the
nature
and
operation
of
spirit
hence
the
seeming
contradiction
in
that
scripture
which
is
so
glorious
in
its
spiritual
signification
truth
has
but
one
reply
to
all
error
to

thou

shalt
thou
return

mythical
as

error
all
die
even
so
in
christ
truth
shall
all
be
made
alive
the
mortality
of
man
is
a
myth
for
man
is
immortal
the
false
belief
that
spirit
is
now
submerged
in

at
some
future
time
to
be
cipated
from
it
this
belief
alone
is
mortal

god
never
germinates
but
is
the
same
yesterday
and
and
forever
if
mind
god
ates
error
that
error
must
exist
in
the
divine
mind
and
this
assumption
of
error
would
dethrone
the
perfection
of
deity
no
truth
from
a
material
basis
is
christian
science
contradictory
is
the
divine
principle
of
creation
misstated
has
god
no
science
to
declare
mind
while
matter
is
governed
by
erring
intelligence
there
went
up
a
mist
from
the
earth
this
represents
error
as
starting
from
an
idea
of
good
on
a
material
basis
it
supposes
god
and
man
to
be
manifested
only
through
the
corporeal
senses
although
the
material
senses
can
take
no
cognizance
of
spirit
or
the
spiritual
idea
genesis
and
the
apocalypse
seem
more
obscure
than
other
portions
of
the
scripture
because
they
can
not
possibly
be
interpreted
from
a

standpoint
to
the
author
they
are
transparent
for
they
contain
the
deep
divinity
of
the

dawning

christian

is
dawning
upon
a

age
the
great
spiritual
facts
of
being
like

shine
in

though
the

the

this

if

embryonic

the
late
louis
agassiz
by
his
microscopic
examination
of
a
vulture
ovum
strengthens
the
thinker
conclusions
as
to
the
scientific
theory
of

agassiz
was
able
to
see
in

the
earth
phere
the
gathering
clouds
the
moon
and

while
the
germinating
speck
of
embryonic

seemed
a
small
sun
in
its
history
of
mortality
darwin
theory
of
evolution
from
a
material
basis
is
more
consistent
than
most
theories
briefly
this
is
darwin
theory
that
mind
produces
its
opposite
matter
and
endues
matter
with
power
to
recreate
the
universe
including
man
terial
evolution
implies
that
the
great
first
cause
must
become
material
and
afterwards
must
either
return
to
mind
or
go
down
into
dust
and
nothingness
true
theory
of
the
universe
the
scriptures
are
very
sacred
our
aim
must
be
to
have
them
understood
spiritually
for
only
by
this
standing
can
truth
be
gained
the
true
ory
of
the
universe
including
man
is
not
in
material
history
but
in
spiritual
development
inspired
thought
relinquishes
a
material
sensual
and
mortal
theory
of
the
universe
and
adopts
the
spiritual
and
immortal
scriptural
perception
it
is
this
spiritual
perception
of
scripture
which
lifts
humanity
out
of
disease
and
death
and
inspires
faith
the
spirit
and
the
bride

come

ever

let

freely
christian
science
separates
error
from
truth
and
breathes
through
the
sacred
pages
the
spiritual
sense
of
life
substance
and
intelligence
in
this
science
we
cover
man
in
the
image
and
likeness
of
god
we
see
that
man
has
never
lost
his
spiritual
estate
and
his
eternal
harmony
the
clouds
dissolving
how
little
light
or
heat
reach
our
earth
when
clouds
cover
the
sun
face
so
christian
science
can
be
seen
only
as
the
clouds
of
corporeal
sense
roll
away
earth
has
little
light
or
joy
for
mortals
before
life
is
spiritually
learned
every
agony
of
mortal
error
helps
error
to
destroy
error
and
so
aids
the
apprehension
of
immortal
truth
this
is
the
new
birth
going
on
hourly
by
which

a
famous
naturalist
says
it
is
very
possible
that
many
general
statements
now
current
about
birth
and
generation
will
be
changed
with
the
progress
of
information
had
the
naturalist
through
his
tireless
researches
gained
the
diviner
side
in
christian
science
so
far
apart
from
his
material
sense
of
animal
growth
and
organization
he
would
have
blessed
the
human
race
more
abundantly

natural

is
richly
endowed
by
the
labors
and
genius
of
great

modern
discoveries

brought
to

important

agassiz

methods

study
in

certain
mals
besides
the
ordinary
process
of

also
increase
their
numbers
naturally
and
constantly

division
this
discovery
is
corroborative
of
the
science
of
mind
for
this
discovery
shows
that
the
multiplication
of
certain
animals
takes
place
apart
from
sexual
tions
the
supposition
that
life
germinates
in
eggs
and
must
decay
after
it
has
grown
to
maturity
if
not
before
is
shown
by
divine
metaphysics
to
be
a
mistake
a
blunder
which
will
finally
give
place
to
higher
theories
and
demonstrations
the
three
processes
creatures
of
lower
forms
of
organism
are
supposed
to
have
as
classes
three
different
methods
of
tion
and
to
multiply
their
species
sometimes
through
eggs
sometimes
through
buds
and
sometimes
through
according
to
recent
lore
successive
generations
do
not
begin
with
the
of
new
individuals
or
personalities
but
with
the
formation
of
the
nucleus
or
egg
from
which
one
or
more
alities
subsequently
emerge
and
we
must
therefore
look
upon
the
simple
ovum
as
the
germ
the
of
the
most
complicated
corporeal
structures
including
those
which
we
call
human
here
these
material
researches
culminate
in
such
vague
hypotheses
as
must
necessarily
attend
false
systems
which
rely
upon
physics
and
are
void
of
metaphysics
deference
to
material
law
in
one
instance
a
celebrated
naturalist
agassiz
covers
the
pathway
leading
to
divine
science
and
beards
the
lion
of
materialism
in
its
den
at
that
point
however
even
this
great
observer
takes
nature
forsakes
spirit
as
the
divine
origin
of
creative
truth
and
allows
matter
and
material
law
to
usurp
the
prerogatives
of
omnipotence
he
absolutely
drops
from
his
summit
coming
down
to
a
belief
in
the
material
origin
of
man
for
he
virtually
affirms
that
the
germ
of
humanity
is
in
a
circumscribed
and
intelligent
egg
interrogations
if
this
be
so
whence
cometh
life
or
mind
to
the
human
race
matter
surely
does
not
possess
mind
god
is
the
life
or
intelligence
which
forms
and
preserves
the
individuality
and
identity
of
animals
as
well
as
of
men
god
can
not
become
finite
and
be
limited
within
material
bounds
spirit
can
not
become
matter
nor
can
spirit
be
developed
through
its
opposite
of
what
avail
is
it
to
investigate
what
is
miscalled
material
life
which
ends
even
as
it
gins
in
nameless
nothingness
the
true
sense
of
being
and
its
eternal
perfection
should
appear
now
even
as
it
will
hereafter
stages
of
existence
error
of
thought
is
reflected
in
error
of
action
the
continual
contemplation
of
existence
as
material
and
poreal
as
beginning
and
ending
and
with
birth
decay
and
dissolution
as
its
component
stages
hides
the
true
and
spiritual
life
and
causes
our
standard
to
trail
in
the
dust
if
life
has
any
point
whatsoever
then
the
great
i
am
is
a
myth
if
life
is
god
as
the
scriptures
imply
then
life
is
not
onic
it
is
infinite
an
egg
is
an
impossible
enclosure
for
deity
embryology
supplies
no
instance
of
one
species
ducing
its
opposite
a
serpent
never
begets
a
bird
nor
does
a
lion
bring
forth
a
lamb
amalgamation
is
deemed
monstrous
and
is
seldom
fruitful
but
it
is
not
so
hideous
and
absurd
as
the
supposition
that
spirit
the
pure
and
holy
the
immutable
and
immortal
can
originate
the
impure
and
mortal
and
dwell
in
it
as
christian
science
repudiates
impossibilities
the
material
senses
must
father
these
absurdities
for
both
the
material
senses
and
their
reports
are
unnatural
impossible
and
unreal
the
real
producer
either
mind
produces
or
it
is
produced
if
mind
is
first
it
can
not
produce
its
opposite
in
quality
and
quantity
called
matter
if
matter
is
first
it
can
not
duce
mind
like
produces
like
in
natural
history
the
bird
is
not
the
product
of
a
beast
in
spiritual
history
matter
is
not
the
progenitor
of
mind
the
ascent
of
species
one
distinguished
naturalist
argues
that
mortals
spring
from
eggs
and
in
races
darwin
admits
this
but
he
adds
that
mankind
has
ascended
through
all
the
lower
grades
of
existence
evolution
scribes
the
gradations
of
human
belief
but
it
does
not
acknowledge
the
method
of
divine
mind
nor
see
that
terial
methods
are
impossible
in
divine
science
and
that
all
science
is
of
god
not
of
man
transmitted
peculiarities
naturalists
ask
what
can
there
be
of
a
material
nature
transmitted
through
these
bodies
called
eggs
themselves
composed
of
the
simplest
material
elements
by
which
all
peculiarities
of
cestry
belonging
to
either
sex
are
brought
down
from
generation
to
generation
the
question
of
the
ralist
amounts
to
this
how
can
matter
originate
or
mit
mind
we
answer
that
it
can
not
darkness
and
doubt
encompass
thought
so
long
as
it
bases
creation
on
materiality
from
a
material
standpoint
canst
thou
by
searching
find
out
god
all
must
be
mind
or
else
all
must
be
matter
neither
can
produce
the
other
mind
is
immortal
but
error
declares
that
the
material
seed
must
decay
in
order
to
propagate
its
species
and
the
resulting
germ
is
doomed
to
the
same
routine
causation
not
in
matter
the
ancient
and
hypothetical
question
which
is
first
the
egg
or
the
bird
is
answered
if
the
egg
produces
the
parent
but
we
can
not
stop
here
another
question
follows
who
or
what
produces
the
parent
of
the
egg
that
the
earth
was
hatched
from
the
egg
of
night
was
once
an
accepted
theory
heathen
philosophy
modern
geology
and
all
other
material
potheses
deal
with
causation
as
contingent
on
matter
and
as
necessarily
apparent
to
the
corporeal
senses
even
where
the
proof
requisite
to
sustain
this
assumption
is
discovered
mortal
theories
make
friends
of
sin
sickness
and
death
whereas
the
spiritual
scientific
facts
of
ence
include
no
member
of
this
dolorous
and
fatal
triad
emergence
of
mortals
human
experience
in
mortal
life
which
starts
from
an
egg
corresponds
with
that
of
job
when
he
says
man
that
is
born
of
a
woman
is
of
few
days
and
full
of
trouble
mortals
must
emerge
from
this
notion
of
material
life
as
they
must
peck
open
their
shells
with
christian
science
and
look
outward
and
upward
but
thought
loosened
from
a
material
basis
but
not
yet
instructed
by
science
may
become
wild
with
freedom
and
so
be
persistence
of
species
from
a
material
source
flows
no
remedy
for
sorrow
sin
and
death
for
the
redeeming
power
from
the
ills
they
occasion
is
not
in
egg
nor
in
dust
the
blending
tints
of
leaf
and
flower
show
the
order
of
matter
to
be
the
order
of
mortal
mind
the
intermixture
of
different
species
urged
to
its
utmost
limits
results
in
a
return
to
the
original
species
thus
it
is
learned
that
matter
is
a
manifestation
of
mortal
mind
and
that
matter
always
surrenders
its
claims
when
the
perfect
and
eternal
mind
is
understood
better
basis
than
embryology
naturalists
describe
the
origin
of
mortal
and
material
existence
in
the
various
forms
of
embryology
and
company
their
descriptions
with
important
observations
which
should
awaken
thought
to
a
higher
and
purer
contemplation
of
man
origin
this
clearer
consciousness
must
precede
an
standing
of
the
harmony
of
being
mortal
thought
must
obtain
a
better
basis
get
nearer
the
truth
of
being
or
health
will
never
be
universal
and
harmony
will
never
become
the
standard
of
man
one
of
our
ablest
naturalists
has
said
we
have
no
right
to
assume
that
individuals
have
grown
or
been
formed
under
circumstances
which
made
material
ditions
essential
to
their
maintenance
and
reproduction
or
important
to
their
origin
and
first
introduction
why
then
is
the
naturalist
basis
so
materialistic
and
why
are
his
deductions
generally
material
all
nativity
in
thought
adam
was
created
before
eve
in
this
instance
it
is
seen
that
the
maternal
egg
never
brought
forth
adam
eve
was
formed
from
adam
rib
not
from
a
foetal
ovum
whatever
theory
may
be
adopted
by
general
mortal
thought
to
account
for
human
origin
that
theory
is
sure
to
become
the
signal
for
the
ance
of
its
method
in
finite
forms
and
operations
if
sentaneous
human
belief
agrees
upon
an
ovum
as
the
point
of
emergence
for
the
human
race
this
potent
belief
will
immediately
supersede
the
more
ancient
tion
about
the
creation
from
dust
or
from
the
rib
of
our
primeval
father
being
is
immortal
you
may
say
that
mortals
are
formed
before
they
think
or
know
aught
of
their
origin
and
you
may
also
ask
how
belief
can
affect
a
result
which
precedes
the
development
of
that
belief
it
can
only
be
replied
that
christian
science
reveals
what
eye
hath
not
seen
even
the
cause
of
all
that
exists
for
the
universe
inclusive
of
man
is
as
eternal
as
god
who
is
its
divine
immortal
principle
there
is
no
such
thing
as
mortality
nor
are
there
properly
any
mortal
beings
because
being
is
immortal
like
deity
or
rather
being
and
deity
are
inseparable
our
conscious
development
error
is
always
error
it
is
any
statement
of
life
following
from
a
misconception
of
life
is
ous
because
it
is
destitute
of
any
knowledge
of
the
selfhood
of
life
destitute
of
any
knowledge
of
its
origin
or
existence
the
mortal
is
unconscious
of
his
foetal
and
infantile
existence
but
as
he
grows
up
into
another
false
claim
that
of
scious
matter
he
learns
to
say
i
am
somebody
but
who
made
me
error
replies
god
made
you
the
first
effort
of
error
has
been
and
is
to
impute
to
god
the
creation
of
whatever
is
sinful
and
mortal
but
infinite
mind
sets
at
naught
such
a
mistaken
belief
mendacity
of
error
jesus
defined
this
opposite
of
god
and
his
creation
better
than
we
can
when
he
said
he
is
a
liar
and
the
father
of
it
jesus
also
said
have
not
i
chosen
you
twelve
and
one
of
you
is
a
devil
this
he
said
of
judas
one
of
adam
race
jesus
never
intimated
that
god
made
a
devil
but
he
did
say
ye
are
of
your
father
the
devil
all
these
sayings
were
to
show
that
mind
in
matter
is
the
author
of
itself
and
is
simply
a
falsity
and
illusion
ailments
of
animals
it
is
the
general
belief
that
the
lower
animals
are
less
sickly
than
those
possessing
higher
tions
especially
those
of
the
human
form
this
would
indicate
that
there
is
less
disease
in
tion
as
the
force
of
mortal
mind
is
less
pungent
or
tive
and
that
health
attends
the
absence
of
mortal
mind
a
fair
conclusion
from
this
might
be
that
it
is
the
human
belief
and
not
the
divine
arbitrament
which
brings
the
physical
organism
under
the
yoke
of
disease
ignorance
the
sign
of
error
an
inquirer
once
said
to
the
discoverer
of
christian
science
i
like
your
explanations
of
truth
but
i
do
not
comprehend
what
you
say
about
error
this
is
the
nature
of
error
the
mark
of
rance
is
on
its
forehead
for
it
neither
understands
nor
can
be
understood
error
would
have
itself
received
as
mind
as
if
it
were
as
real
and
as
truth
but
christian
science
attributes
to
error
neither
entity
nor
power
because
error
is
neither
mind
nor
the
outcome
of
mind
the
origin
of
divinity
searching
for
the
origin
of
man
who
is
the
reflection
of
god
is
like
inquiring
into
the
origin
of
god
the
existent
and
eternal
only
impotent
error
would
seek
to
unite
spirit
with
matter
good
with
evil
immortality
with
mortality
and
call
this
sham
unity
as
if
man
were
the
offspring
of
both
mind
and
matter
of
both
deity
and
humanity
tion
rests
on
a
spiritual
basis
we
lose
our
standard
of
perfection
and
set
aside
the
proper
conception
of
deity
when
we
admit
that
the
perfect
is
the
author
of
aught
that
can
become
imperfect
that
god
bestows
the
power
to
sin
or
that
truth
confers
the
ability
to
err
our
great
example
jesus
could
restore
the
individualized
manifestation
of
existence
which
seemed
to
vanish
in
death
knowing
that
god
was
the
life
of
man
jesus
was
able
to
present
himself
unchanged
after
the
fixion
truth
fosters
the
idea
of
truth
and
not
the
lief
in
illusion
or
error
that
which
is
real
is
sustained
by
spirit
genera
classified
vertebrata
articulata
mollusca
and
radiata
are
tal
and
material
concepts
classified
and
are
supposed
to
possess
life
and
mind
these
false
beliefs
will
disappear
when
the
radiation
of
spirit
destroys
forever
all
belief
in
intelligent
matter
then
will
the
new
heaven
and
new
earth
appear
for
the
mer
things
will
have
passed
away
the
christian
privilege
mortal

the

of

mortal
belief

again
in
renewed
forms
only
to
go
out
at

forever
for

not
to
be
gained
by

christian
science
may
sorb
the
attention
of
sage
and
philosopher
but
the
christian
alone
can
fathom
it
it
is
made
known
most
fully
to
him
who
understands
best
the
divine
life
did
the

and
the
enlightenment
of
the

from
the

they

even
so
goes
on
the
of
which
mortal

the

ontology
receives
less

than

why
because

must
waken
to
spiritual

before
it

to
solve
the
problem
of

hence
the
author

but
when
that
awakening
comes
existence
will
be
on
a
new
point
it
is
related
that
a
father
plunged
his
infant
babe
only
a
few
hours
old
into
the
water
for
several
minutes
and
repeated
this
operation
daily
until
the
child
could
remain
under
water
twenty
minutes
moving
and
playing
out
harm
like
a
fish
parents
should
remember
this
and
learn
how
to
develop
their
children
properly
on
dry
land
the
curse
removed

controls
the
in
the
lower
realms
of
nature
where
parturition
is
without
suffering
tables
minerals
and
many
animals
suffer
no
pain
in
multiplying
but
human
propagation
has
its
suffering
because
it
is
a
false
belief
christian
ence
reveals
harmony
as
proportionately
increasing
as
the
line
of
creation
rises
towards
spiritual
man
towards
enlarged
understanding
and
intelligence
but
in
the
line
of
the
corporeal
senses
the
less
a
mortal
knows
of
sin
disease
and
mortality
the
better
for
him
the
less
pain

are
his
when
the
mist
of
mortal

orates
the
curse
will
be
removed
which
says
to
woman
in

thou
shalt
bring
forth
children
divine
science
rolls
back
the
clouds
of
error
with
the
light

and
lifts
the
curtain
on
man
as
never
born

as

as
coexistent

popular
theology
takes
up
the
history
of
man
as
if
he

lesson
the
twelfth
chapter
of

of

has
a
special
suggestiveness

with
the

of
the
sixth
seal
typical
of
six
thousand
years
since
adam
the
distinctive
feature
has
reference
to
the
present
age
xii
and
there
appeared
a
great
wonder
in
heaven
a
woman
clothed
with
the
sun
and
the
moon
under
her
feet
and
upon
her
head
a
crown
of
twelve
stars
true
estimate
of
god
messenger
heaven
represents
harmony
and
divine
science
prets
the
principle
of
heavenly
harmony
the
great
miracle
to
human
sense
is
divine
love
and
the
grand
necessity
of
existence
is
to
gain
the
true
idea
of
what
constitutes
the
kingdom
of
heaven
in
man
this
goal
is
never
reached
while
we
hate
our
neighbor
or
entertain
a
false
estimate
of
one
whom
god
has
appointed
to
voice
his
word
again
without
a
correct
sense
of
its
highest
visible
idea
we
can
never
understand
the
divine
principle
the

is
it
with

persecution
harmful
abuse
of
the
motives
and
religion
of
paul
hid
from

the

character
which
made
him
equal
to
his
great
mission
persecution
of
all
who
have
spoken
something
new
and
better
of
god
has
not
only
obscured
the
light
of
the
ages
but
has
been
fatal
to
the
persecutors
why
because
it
has
hid
from
them
the
true
idea
which
has
been
presented
to
understand
paul
was
to
be
ignorant
of
the
divine
idea
he
taught
ignorance
of
the
divine
idea
betrays
at
once
a
greater
ignorance
of
the
divine
principle
of
the
idea
rance
of
truth
and
love
the
understanding
of
truth
and
love
the
principle
which
works
out
the
ends
of
eternal
good
and
destroys
both
faith
in
evil
and
the
practice
of
evil
leads
to
the
discernment
of
the
divine
idea
espousals
supernal
agassiz
through
his
microscope
saw
the
sun
in
an
egg
at
a
point
of
embryonic
life
because
of
his
more
spiritual
vision
john
saw
an
angel
standing
in
the
sun
the
revelator
beheld
the
spiritual
idea
from
the
mount
of
vision
purity
was
the
symbol
of
life
and
love
the
revelator
saw
also
the
spiritual
ideal
as
a
woman
clothed
in
light
a
bride
coming
down
from
heaven
wedded
to
the
lamb
of
love
to
john
the

the
lamb
sented
the
correlation
of
divine
principle
and
spiritual
idea
god
and
his
christ
bringing
harmony
to
earth
divinity
and
humanity
john
saw
the
human
and
divine
coincidence
shown
in
the
man
jesus
as
divinity
embracing
humanity
in
life
and
its
demonstration
reducing
to
human
perception
and
understanding
the
life
which
is
god
in
divine
revelation
material
and
corporeal
hood
disappear
and
the
spiritual
idea
is
understood
spiritual
sunlight
the
woman
in
the
apocalypse
symbolizes
generic
man
the
spiritual
idea
of
god
she
illustrates
the
coincidence
of
god
and
man
as
the
divine
principle
and
divine
idea
the
revelator
symbolizes
spirit
by
the
sun
the
spiritual
idea
is
clad
with
the
radiance
of
spiritual
truth
and
matter
is
put
under
her
feet
the
light
portrayed
is
really
neither
solar
nor
lunar
but
ual
life
which
is
the
light
of
men
in
the
first
chapter
of
the
fourth
gospel
it
is
written
there
was
a
man
sent
from
god
to
bear
witness
of
that
light
spiritual
idea
revealed
john
the
baptist
prophesied
the
coming
of
the
maculate
jesus
and
john
saw
in
those
days
the
spiritual
idea
as
the
messiah
who
would
baptize
with
the
holy
ghost
divine
science
as
elias
presented
the
idea
of
the
fatherhood
of
god
which
jesus
afterwards
manifested
so
the
revelator
completed
this
figure
with
woman
typifying
the
spiritual
idea
of
motherhood
the
moon
is
under
her
feet
this
idea
reveals
the
universe
as
secondary
and
tributary
to
spirit
from
which
the
universe
borrows
its
reflected
light
stance
life
and
intelligence
spiritual
idea
crowned
the
spiritual
idea
is
crowned
with
twelve
stars
the
twelve
tribes
of
israel
with
all
mortals
separated
by
belief
from
man
divine
origin
and
the
true
idea
will
through
much
tribulation
yield
to
the
activities
of
the
divine
principle
of
man
in
the
mony
of
science
these
are
the
stars
in
the
crown
of
rejoicing
they
are
the
lamps
in
the
spiritual
heavens
of
the
age
which
show
the
workings
of
the
spiritual
idea
by
healing
the
sick
and
the
sinning
and
by
manifesting
the
light
which
shines
unto
the
perfect
day
as
the
night
of
materialism
wanes
xii
and
she
being
with
child
cried
ing
in
birth
and
pained
to
be
delivered
travail
and
joy
also
the
spiritual
idea
is
typified
by
a
woman
in
vail
waiting
to
be
delivered
of
her
sweet
promise
but
membering
no
more
her
sorrow
for
joy
that
the
birth
goes
on
for
great
is
the
idea
and
the
travail
portentous
xii
and
there
appeared
another
wonder
in
heaven
and
behold
a
great
red
dragon
having
seven
heads
and
ten
horns
and
seven
crowns
upon
his
heads
the
dragon
as
a
type
human
sense
may
well
marvel
at
discord
while
to
a
diviner
harmony
is
the
real
and
discord
the
unreal
we
may
well
be
astonished
at
sin
sickness
and
death
we
may
well
be
perplexed
at
human
fear
and
still
more
astounded
at
hatred
which
lifts
its
hydra
head
showing
its
horns
in
the
many
inventions
of
evil
but
why
should
we
stand
aghast
at
nothingness
the
great
red
dragon
symbolizes
a
lie
the
belief
that
substance
life
and
intelligence
can
be
material
this
dragon
stands
for
the
sum
total
of
human
error
the
ten
horns
of
the
dragon
typify
the
belief
that
ter
has
power
of
its
own
and
that
by
means
of
an
evil
mind
in
matter
the
ten
commandments
can
be
broken
the
sting
of
the
serpent
the
revelator
lifts
the
veil
from
this
embodiment
of
all
evil
and
beholds
its
awful
character
but
he
also
sees
the
nothingness
of
evil
and
the
allness
of
god
the
revelator
sees
that
old
serpent
whose
name
is
devil
or
evil
holding
untiring
watch
that
he
may
bite
the
heel
of
truth
and
seemingly
impede
the
offspring
of
the
spiritual
idea
which
is
prolific
in
health
holiness
and
immortality
xii
and
his
tail
drew
the
third
part
of
the
stars
of
heaven
and
did
cast
them
to
the
earth

the
dragon
stood
before
the
woman
which
was
ready
to
be
delivered
for
to
devour
her
child
as
soon
as
it
was
born
animal
tendency
the
serpentine
form
stands
for
subtlety
winding
its
way
amidst
all
evil
but
doing
this
in
the
name
of
good
its
sting
is
spoken
of
by
paul
when
he
refers
to
spiritual
wickedness
in
high
places
it
is
the
animal
instinct
in
mortals
which
would
impel
them
to
devour
each
other
and
cast
out
devils
through
beelzebub
as
of
old
evil
still
charges
the
spiritual
idea
with
own
nature
and
methods
this
malicious
animal
stinct
of
which
the
dragon
is
the
type
incites
mortals
to
kill
morally
and
physically
even
their
and
worse
still
to
charge
the
innocent
with
the
crime
this
last
infirmity
of
sin
will
sink
its
perpetrator
into
a
night
without
a
star
malicious
barbarity
the
author
is
convinced
that
the
accusations
against
jesus
of
nazareth
and
even
his
crucifixion
were
instigated
by
the
criminal
instinct
here
described
the
revelator
speaks
of
jesus
as
the
lamb
of
god
and
of
the
dragon
as
warring
against
innocence
since
jesus
must
have
been
tempted
in
all
points
he
the
immaculate
met
and
conquered
sin
in
every
form
the
brutal
barity
of
his
foes
could
emanate
from
no
source
except
the
highest
degree
of
human
depravity
jesus
not
his
until
the
majesty
of
truth
should
be
strated
in
divine
science
the
spiritual
idea
was
arraigned
before
the
tribunal
of
mortal
mind
which
was
unloosed
in
order
that
the
false
claim
of
mind
in
matter
might
uncover
its
own
crime
of
defying
immortal
mind
doom
of
the
dragon
from
genesis
to
the
apocalypse
sin
sickness
and
death
envy
hatred
and
revenge
all
evil
are
fied
by
a
serpent
or
animal
subtlety
jesus
said
quoting
a
line
from
the
psalms
they
hated
me
without
a
cause
the
serpent
is
perpetually
close
upon
the
heel
of
harmony
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
the
serpent
pursues
with
hatred
the
spiritual
idea
in
genesis
this
allegorical
talking
serpent
fies
mortal
mind
more
subtle
than
any
beast
of
the
field
in
the
apocalypse
when
nearing
its
doom
this
evil
increases
and
becomes
the
great
red
dragon
swollen
with
sin
inflamed
with
war
against
spirituality
and
ripe
for
destruction
it
is
full
of
lust
and
hate
loathing
the
brightness
of
divine
glory

unto

the

this

according

all
was
primeval

the
material
lie
made

this

impelled
the

to
rise
to
the
zenith

demonstration
destroying
sin

to
be
caught
up

triumphantly
through

ebbing

they
were
led
through
the
wilderness
walking
wearily
through
the
great
desert
of
human
hopes

anticipating
the
promised
joy
so

the

guide
all

passage
from

a
pillar

by

heights
if
we
remember
the
beautiful
description
which
sir
walter
scott
puts
into
the
mouth
of
rebecca
the
jewess
in
the
story
of
ivanhoe

out

awful

we
may
also
offer
the
prayer

concludes
the

oh

the
frequent

there
was
war
in

michael

strength
he
leads
the
hosts

against

satan

fights
the
holy

gabriel
has
the
more
quiet
task
of
imparting
a
sense

the
of
ministering
love
these
angels
deliver
us
from
the

truth

come
nearer

strong

the
gabriel

has
no
contests

all

there
is
no

no

the

he
is
killed
by

prevail
against

the

can
not
war

thus
endeth
the
conflict

and
the
great
dragon
was
cast
out
that
old
serpent
called
the
devil

eth
the

he
was
cast
out
into

dragon
cast
down

that
false

ancient

devil
evil
claiming
that
there
is
gence
in
matter
either
to
benefit
or
to
injure
men
is
pure
delusion
the
red
dragon
and
it
is
cast
out
by
christ
truth
the
spiritual
idea
and
so
proved
to
be
powerless
the
words
cast
unto
the
earth
show
the
dragon
to
be
nothingness
dust
to
dust
and
therefore
in
his
pretence
of
being
a
talker
he
must
be
a
lie
from
the
beginning
his
angels
or
sages
are
cast
out
with
their
author
the
beast
and
the
false
prophets
are
lust

hypocrisy
these
wolves
in

clothing
are
detected

killed
by
innocence
the
lamb

warfare
with

divine
science
shows
how
the
lamb
slays
the

innocence

truth
overcome
guilt
and
error
ever
since
the
foundation
of
the
world
ever
since
error
would
establish
material
belief
evil
has
tried
to
slay
the
lamb
but
science
is
able
to
destroy
this
lie
called
evil
the
twelfth
chapter
of
the
apocalypse
typifies
the
divine
method
of
warfare
in
science
and
the
glorious
results
of
this
warfare
the
following
chapters
depict
the
fatal
effects
of
trying
to
meet
error
with
error
the
narrative
follows
the
order
used
in
genesis
in
genesis
first
the
true
method
of
creation
is
set
forth
and
then
the
false
here
also
the
revelator
first
exhibits
the
true
warfare
and
then
the
false
xii
and
i
heard
a
loud
voice
saying
in
heaven
now
is
come
salvation
and
strength
and
the
kingdom
of
our
god
and
the
power
of
his
christ
for
the
accuser
of
our
brethren
is
cast
down
which
accused
them
before
our
god
day
and
night
and
they
overcame
him
by
the
blood
of
the
lamb
and
by
the
word
of
their
testimony
and
they
loved
not
their
lives
unto
the
death
therefore
rejoice
ye
heavens
and
ye
that
dwell
in

woe

inhabiters

and
of
the
sea
for
the
devil
is
come
down
unto
you
having
great
wrath
because
he
knoweth
that
he
hath
but
a
short
time
paean
of
jubilee
for
victory
over
a
single
sin
we
give
thanks
and
nify
the
lord
of
hosts
what
shall
we
say
of
the
mighty
conquest
over
all
sin
a
louder
song
sweeter
than
has
ever
before
reached
high
heaven
now
rises
clearer
and
nearer
to
the
great
heart
of
christ
for
the
accuser
is
not
there
and
love
sends
forth
her
primal
and
everlasting
strain
by
which
we
lay
down
all
for
truth
or
christ
in
our
warfare
against
error
is
a
rule
in
christian
science
this
rule
clearly
interprets
god
as
divine
principle
as
life
represented
by
the
father
as
truth
represented
by
the
son
as
love
represented
by
the
mother
every
mortal
at
some
period
here
or
hereafter
must
grapple
with
and
overcome
the
mortal
belief
in
a
power
opposed
to
god
the
robe
of
science
the
scripture
thou
hast
been
faithful
over
a
few
things
i
will
make
thee
ruler
over
many
is
literally
filled
when
we
are
conscious
of
the
supremacy
of
truth
by
which
the
nothingness
of
error
is
seen
and
we
know
that
the
nothingness
of
error
is
in
proportion
to
its
wickedness
he
that
touches
the
hem
of
christ
robe
and
masters
his
mortal
beliefs
animality
and
hate
rejoices
in
the
proof
of
healing
in
a
sweet
and
certain
sense
that
god
is
love
alas
for
those
who
break
faith
with
divine
science
and
fail
to
strangle
the
serpent
of
sin
as
well
as
of
sickness
they
are
dwellers
still
in
the
deep
darkness
of
belief
they
are
in
the
ing
sea
of
error
not
struggling
to
lift
their
heads
above
the
drowning
wave
expiation
by
suffering
what
must
the
end
be
they
must
eventually
ate
their
sin
through
suffering
the
sin
which
one
has
made
his
bosom
companion
comes
back
to
him
at
last
with
accelerated
force
for
the
devil
knoweth
his
time
is
short
here
the
scriptures
declare
that
evil
is
temporal
not
eternal
the
dragon
is
at
last
stung
to
death
by
his
own
malice
but
how
many
periods
of
torture
it
may
take
to
remove
all
sin
must
depend
upon
sin
obduracy
xii
and
when
the
dragon
saw
that
he
was
cast
unto
the
earth
he
persecuted
the
woman
which
brought
forth
the
man
child
apathy
to
occultism
the
march
of
mind
and
of
honest
investigation
will
bring
the
hour
when
the
people
will
chain
with
fetters
of
some
sort
the
growing
occultism
of
this
period
the
present
apathy
as
to
the
tendency
of
certain
active
yet
unseen
mental
agencies
will
finally
be
shocked
into
another
extreme
mortal
mood
into
human
indignation

xii
and
the
serpent
cast
out
of
his
mouth
water
as
a

after
the
woman
that
he
might
cause
her
to
be
carried
away
of
the

the

helped
the

the

opened
her

up

simple
seekers

weary

athirst
in
the

watching
for
rest
and

give
them
a
cup
of
cold
water
in
christ
name
and
never
fear
the
consequences
what
if
the
old

should
send
forth

can
neither
drown

of

and
old
night
in
this
age
the
earth
will
help
the

the
spiritual
idea
will
be
understood
those
ready
for
the
blessing
you
impart
will
give
thanks
the
waters
will
be
fied
and
christ
will
command
the
wave
hidden
ways
of
iniquity
when
god
heals
the
sick
or
the
sinning
they
should
know
the
great
benefit
which
mind
has
wrought
they
should
also
know
the
great
delusion
of
tal
mind
when
it
makes
them
sick
or
sinful
many
are
willing
to
open
the
eyes
of
the
people
to
the
power
of
good
resident
in
divine
mind
but
they
are
not
so
willing
to
point
out
the
evil
in
human
thought
and
expose
evil
hidden
mental
ways
of
accomplishing
iniquity
christly
warning
why
this
backwardness
since
exposure
is
necessary
to
ensure
the
avoidance
of
the
evil
because
people
like
you
better
when
you
tell
them
their
virtues
than
when
you
tell
them
their
vices
it
quires
the
spirit
of
our
blessed
master
to
tell
a
man
his
faults
and
so
risk
human
displeasure
for
the
sake
of
doing
right
and
benefiting
our
race
who
is
telling
mankind
of
the
foe
in
ambush
is
the
informer
one
who
sees
the
foe
if
so
listen
and
be
wise
escape
from
evil
and
designate
those
as
unfaithful
stewards
who
have
seen
the
danger
and
yet
have
given
no
warning
the
armor
of
divinity
at
all
times
and
under
all
circumstances
overcome
evil
with
good
know
thyself
and
god
will
supply
the
wisdom
and
the
occasion
for
a
victory
over
evil
clad
in
the
panoply
of
love
human
hatred
can
not
reach
you
the
cement
of
a
higher
humanity
will
unite
all
interests
in
the
one
divinity
pure
religion
enthroned
through
trope
and
metaphor
the
revelator
immortal
scribe
of
spirit
and
of
a
true
idealism
furnishes
the
mirror
in
which
mortals
may
see
their
own
image
in
significant
figures
he
depicts
the
thoughts
which
he
beholds
in
mortal
mind
thus
he
rebukes
the
conceit
of
sin
and
foreshadows
its
doom
with
his
spiritual
strength
he
has
opened
wide
the
gates
of
glory
and
illumined
the
night
of
paganism
with
the
sublime
grandeur
of
divine
science
outshining
sin
sorcery
lust
and
hypocrisy
he
takes
away
mitre
and
sceptre
he
enthrones
pure
and
undefiled
religion
and
lifts
on
high
only
those
who
have
washed
their
robes
white
in
obedience
and
suffering
native
nothingness
of
sin
thus
we
see
in
both
the
first
and
last
books
of
the
bible
in
genesis
and
in
the
apocalypse
that
sin
is
to
be
christianly
and
scientifically
reduced
to
its
native
nothingness
love
one
other
i
john
iii
is
the
most
simple
and
profound
counsel
of
the
inspired
writer
in
science
we
are
dren
of
god
but
whatever
is
of
material
sense
or
tal
belongs
not
to
his
children
for
materiality
is
the
inverted
image
of
spirituality
fulfilment
of
the
law
love
fulfils
the
law
of
christian
science
and
nothing
short
of
this
divine
principle
understood
and
strated
can
ever
furnish
the
vision
of
the
apocalypse
open
the
seven
seals
of
error
with
truth
or
uncover
the
myriad
illusions
of
sin
sickness
and
death
under
the
supremacy
of
spirit
it
will
be
seen
and
acknowledged
that
matter
must
disappear
in
revelation
xxi
we
read
and
i
saw
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
for
the
first
heaven
and
the
first
earth
were
passed
away
and
there
was
no
more
sea
man
present
possibilities
the
revelator
had
not
yet
passed
the
transitional
stage
in
human
experience
called
death
but
he
already
saw
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
through
what
sense
came
this
vision
to
john
not
through
the
material
visual
organs
for
seeing
for
optics
are
inadequate
to
take
in
so
wonderful
a
scene
were
this
new
heaven
and
new
earth
terrestrial
or
celestial
rial
or
spiritual
they
could
not
be
the
former
for
the
human
sense
of
space
is
unable
to
grasp
such
a
view
the
revelator
was
on
our
plane
of
existence
while
yet
beholding
what
the
eye
can
not
see
that
which
is
visible
to
the
uninspired
thought
this
testimony
of
holy
writ
sustains
the
fact
in
science
that
the
heavens
and
earth
to
one
human
consciousness
that
consciousness
which
god
bestows
are
spiritual
while
to
another
the
unillumined
human
mind
the
vision
is
material
this
shows
unmistakably
that
what
the
human
mind
terms
matter
and
spirit
indicates
states
and
stages
of
sciousness
nearness
of
deity
accompanying
this
scientific
consciousness
was
other
revelation
even
the
declaration
from
heaven
preme
harmony
that
god
the
divine
principle
of
harmony
is
ever
with
men
and
they
are
his
people
thus
man
was
no
longer
regarded
as
a
erable
sinner
but
as
the
blessed
child
of
god
why
because
john
corporeal
sense
of
the
heavens
and
earth
had
vanished
and
in
place
of
this
false
sense
was
the
spiritual
sense
the
subjective
state
by
which
he
could
see
the
new
heaven
and
new
earth
which
involve
the
spiritual
idea
and
consciousness
of
reality
this
is
tural
authority
for
concluding
that
such
a
recognition
of
being
is
and
has
been
possible
to
men
in
this
present
state
of
existence
that
we
can
become
conscious
here
and
now
of
a
cessation
of
death
sorrow
and
pain
this
is
indeed
a
foretaste
of
absolute
christian
science
take
heart
dear
sufferer
for
this
reality
of
being
will
surely
appear
sometime
and
in
some
way
there
will
be
no
more
pain
and
all
tears
will
be
wiped
away
when
you
read
this
remember
jesus
words
the
kingdom
of
god
is
within
you
this
spiritual
consciousness
is
therefore
a
present
possibility
the
revelator
also
takes
in
another
view
adapted
to
console
the
weary
pilgrim
journeying
uphill
all
the
way
he
writes
in
revelation
xxi
and
there
came
unto
me
one
of
the
seven
angels
which
had
the
seven
vials
full
of
the
seven
last
plagues
and
talked
with
me
saying
come
hither
i
will
show
thee
the
bride
the
lamb
wife
vials
of
wrath
and
consolation
this
ministry
of
truth
this
message
from
divine
love
carried
john
away
in
spirit
it
exalted
him
till
he
came
conscious
of
the
spiritual
facts
of
being
and
the
new
jerusalem
coming
down
from
god
out
of
heaven
the
spiritual
ing
of
bliss
and
glory
which
he
describes
as
the
city
which
lieth
foursquare
the
beauty
of
this
text
is
that
the
sum
total
of
human
misery
represented
by
the
seven
angelic
vials
full
of
seven
plagues
has
full
compensation
in
the
law
of
love
note
this
that
the
very
message
or
thought
which
poured
forth
hatred
and
torment
brought
also
the
experience
which
at
last
lifted
the
seer
to
behold
the
great
city
the
four
equal
sides
of
which
were
and
spiritual
wedlock
think
of
this
dear
reader
for
it
will
lift
the
cloth
from
your
eyes
and
you
will
behold
the
winged
dove
descending
upon
you
the
very
circumstance
which
your
suffering
sense
deems
wrathful
and
afflictive
love
can
make
an
angel
entertained
unawares
then
thought
gently
whispers
come
hither
arise
from
your
false
consciousness
into
the
true
sense
of
love
and
behold
the
wife
love
wedded
to
its
own
spiritual
idea
then
cometh
the
marriage
feast
for
this
revelation
will
stroy
forever
the
physical
plagues
imposed
by
material
sense
the
city
foursquare
this
sacred
city
described
in
the
apocalypse
xxi
as
one
that
lieth
foursquare
and
cometh
down
from
god
out
of
heaven
represents
the
light
and
glory
of
divine
science
the
builder
and
maker
of
this
new
jerusalem
is
god
as
we
read
in
the
book
of
hebrews
and
it
is
a
city
which
hath
tions
the
description
is
metaphoric
spiritual
ing
must
always
be
by
symbols
did
not
jesus
illustrate
the
truths
he
taught
by
the
and
the
gal
taken
in
its
allegorical
sense
the
description
of
the
city
as
foursquare
has
a
profound
meaning
the
four
sides
of
our
city
are
the
word
christ
christianity
and
divine
science
and
the
gates
of
it
shall
not
be
shut
at
all
by
day
for
there
shall
be
no
night
there
this
city
is
wholly
spiritual
as
its
four
sides
indicate
the
royally
divine
gates
as
the
psalmist
saith
beautiful
for
situation
the
joy
of
the
whole
earth
is
mount
zion
on
the
sides
of
the
north
the
city
of
the
great
king
it
is
indeed
a
city
of
the
spirit
fair
royal
and
square
northward
its
gates
open
to
the
north
star
the
word
the
polar
magnet
of
revelation
eastward
to
the
star
seen
by
the
wisemen
of
the
orient
who
lowed
it
to
the
manger
of
jesus
southward
to
the
genial
tropics
with
the
southern
cross
in
the
skies
the
cross
of
calvary
which
binds
human
society
into
solemn
union
westward
to
the
grand
realization
of
the
golden
shore
of
love
and
the
peaceful
sea
of
harmony
revelation
pure
zenith
this
heavenly
city
lighted
by
the
sun
of
ness
this
new
jerusalem
this
infinite
all
which
to
us
seems
hidden
in
the
mist
of
remoteness
reached
john
vision
while
yet
he
nacled
with
mortals
in
revelation
xxi
further
describing
this
holy
city
the
beloved
disciple
writes
and
i
saw
no
temple
therein
for
the
lord
god
almighty
and
the
lamb
are
the
temple
of
it
the
shrine
celestial
there
was
no
temple
that
is
no
material
structure
in
which
to
worship
god
for
he
must
be
worshipped
in
spirit
and
in
love
the
word
also
means
body
the
revelator
was
familiar
with
jesus
use
of
this
word
as
when
jesus
spoke
of
his
material
body
as
the
temple
to
be
temporarily
rebuilt
john
ii
what
further
indication
need
we
of
the
real
man
incorporeality
than
this
that
john
saw
heaven
and
earth
with
no
temple
body
therein
this
kingdom
of
god
is
within
you
is
within
reach
of
man
consciousness
here
and
the
spiritual
idea
reveals
it
in
divine
science
man
possesses
this
recognition
of
harmony
consciously
in
proportion
to
his
understanding
of
god
divine
sense
of
deity
the
term
lord
as
used
in
our
version
of
the
old
testament
is
often
synonymous
with
jehovah
and
presses
the
jewish
concept
not
yet
elevated
to
deific
apprehension
through
spiritual
figuration
yet
the
word
gradually
approaches
a
higher
meaning
this
human
sense
of
deity
yields
to
the
divine
sense
even
as
the
material
sense
of
personality
yields
to
the
incorporeal
sense
of
god
and
man
as
the
infinite
principle
and
infinite
idea
as
one
father
with
his
versal
family
held
in
the
gospel
of
love
the
wife
presents
the
unity
of
male
and
female
as
no
longer
two
wedded
individuals
but
as
two
individual
natures
in
one
and
this
compounded
spiritual
individuality
flects
god
as
not
as
a
corporeal
being
in
this
divinely
united
spiritual
consciousness
there
is
no
impediment
to
eternal
bliss
to
the
perfectibility
of
god
creation
the
city
of
our
god
this
spiritual
holy
habitation
has
no
boundary
nor
limit
but
its
four
cardinal
points
are
first
the
word
of
life
truth
and
love
second
the
christ
the
spiritual
idea
of
god
third
christianity
which
is
the
outcome
of
the
divine
ciple
of
the
in
christian
history
fourth
christian
science
which
and
forever
interprets
this
great
example
and
the
great
exemplar
this
city
of
our
god
has
no
need
of
sun
or
satellite
for
love
is
the
light
of
it
and
divine
mind
is
its
own
interpreter
all
who
are
saved
must
walk
in
this
light
mighty
potentates
and
dynasties
will
lay
down
their
honors
within
the
heavenly
city
its
gates
open
towards
light
and
glory
both
within
and
without
for
all
is
good
and
nothing
can
enter
that
city
which
defileth
or
maketh
a
lie
the
writer
present
feeble
sense
of
christian
science
closes
with
john
revelation
as
recorded
by
the
great
apostle
for
his
vision
is
the
acme
of
this
science
as
the
bible
reveals
it
in
the
following
psalm
one
word
shows
though
faintly
the
light
which
christian
science
throws
on
the
scriptures
by
substituting
for
the
corporeal
sense
the
incorporeal
or
spiritual
sense
of
deity
psalm

was
a
great
sufferer
from
a
serious
form
of
rheumatic
trouble
my
hands
being
affected
to
such
an
extent
that
it
was
impossible
for
me
even
to
dress
without
assistance
the
trouble
finally
reached
the
knees
and
i
became
very
lame
and
had
to
be
assisted
in
and
out
of
bed
i
went
to
the
different
health
resorts
for
the
benefit
i
hoped
to
derive
from
the
baths
and
waters
that
were
prescribed
by
physicians
but
found
no
permanent
relief
i
was
placed
under
an
examination
and
was
told
that
the
joints
were
becoming
ossified
i
then
consulted
a
celebrated
specialist
who
after
a
thorough
examination
said
my
condition
would
continue
to
grow
worse
and
that
i
would
become
completely
helpless
at
that
time
a
copy
of

by

was
loaned
me
i
read
it
more
from
curiosity
than
with
the
thought
of
any
physical
benefit
as
the
truth
was
unfolded
to
me
i
realized
that
the
mental
condition
was
what
needed
correcting
and
that
the
spirit
of
truth
which
inspired
this
book
was
my
physician
my
healing
is
complete
and
the
liberation
in
thought
is
manifest
in
a
life
of
active
usefulness
rather
than
the
bondage
of
helpless
invalidism
and
suffering
i
owe
to
our
beloved
leader
eddy
gratitude
which
words
can
not
express
her
revelation
of
the
practical
rather
than
the
merely
theoretical
application
of
jesus

ye
shall
know
the

and
the
truth
shall
make
you
free
proved
to
be
my
redeemer

have

had
not

i
certainly

if
not

truly
thankful

all
the
good

has

i
try

let
my

testify
of

but
to

i

in

i
can
truly
say
yes
i
am
indeed
more
thankful
than
words
can
express
for
the
glorious
healing
that
has
come
to
me
both
physical
mental

moral

also

herein
my
song

substance

it
was
about
fifteen
years
ago
that
christian
science
first
came
to
my
notice
at
that
time
i
had
been
a
chronic
invalid
for
a
good
many
years
i
had
acute
bowel
trouble
bronchitis
and
a
number
of
other
troubles
one
physician
had
told
me
that
my
lungs
were
like
wet
paper
ready
to
tear
at
any
time
and
i
was
filled
with
fear
as
my
mother
two
brothers
and
a
sister
had
been
victims
of
consumption
i
tried
many
physicians
and
every
material
remedy
that
promised
help
but
no
help
came
until
i
found
a
copy
of
eddy
book
science
and
health
the
book
was
placed
in
my
hands
by
one
who
did
not
then
appreciate
it
and
i
was
told
that
it
would
be
hard
for
me
to
understand
it
i
commenced
reading
it
with
this
thought
but
i
caught
beautiful
glimpses
of
truth
which
took
away
my
fear
and
healed
me
of
all
those
diseases
and
they
have
never
returned
i
would
also
like
to
tell
how
i
was
healed
of
a
sprained
ankle
the
accident
occurred
in
the
morning
and
all
that
day
and
during
the
night
i
gave
myself
christian
science
treatment
as
best
i
could
the
next
morning
it
seemed
to
be
no
better
being
very
sore
badly
swollen
and
much
discolored
feeling
that
i
had
done
all
i
could
i
decided
to
stop
thinking
about
it
i
took
my
copy
of
science
and
health
and
began
reading
very
soon
i
became
so
absorbed
in
the
book
that
i
forgot
all
about
my
ankle
it
went
entirely
out
of
my
thought
for
i
had
a
glimpse
of
all
god
creation
as
spiritual
and
for
the
time
being
lost
sight
of
my
material
selfhood
after
two
hours
i
laid
the
book
down
and
walked
into
another
room
when
next
i
thought
of
my
ankle
i
found
it
was
not
hurting
me
the
swelling
had
gone
down
the
black
and
blue
appearance
had
nearly
vanished
and
it
was
perfectly
well
it
was
healed
while
i
was
absent
from
the
body
and
present
with
the
lord
this
experience
was
worth
a
great
deal
to
me
for
it
showed
me
how
the
healing
is
done
portland
fibroid
tumor
healed
in
a
few
days
my
gratitude
for
christian
science
is
boundless
i
was
afflicted
with
a
fibroid
tumor
which
weighed
not
less
than
fifty
pounds
attended
by
a
continuous
hemorrhage
for
eleven
years
the
tumor
was
a
growth
of
eighteen
years
i
lived
in
fort
worth
and
i
had
never
heard
of
christian
science
before
leaving
there
for
chicago
in
the
year
i
had
tried
to
live
near
to
god
and
i
feel
sure
he
guided
me
in
all
my
steps
to
this
healing
and
saving
truth
after
being
there
several
weeks
i
received
letters
from
a
texas
lady
who
had
herself
been
healed
and
who
wrote
urging
me
to
try
christian
science
changing
my
i
met
a
lady
who
owned
a
copy
of
science
and
health
and
in
speaking
to
her
of
having
seen
the
book
she
informed
me
she
had
one
and
she
got
it
and
told
me
i
could
read
it
the
revelation
was
marvelous
and
brought
a
great
spiritual
awakening
this
awakened
sense
never
left
me
and
one
day
when
walking
alone
it
came
to
me
very
suddenly
that
i
was
healed
and
i
walked
the
faster
declaring
every
step
that
i
was
healed
when
i
reached
my
i
found
my
hostess
and
told
her
i
was
healed
she
looked
the
picture
of
amazement
the
tumor
began
to
disappear
at
once
the
hemorrhage
ceased
and
perfect
strength
was
manifest
there
was
no
joy
ever
greater
than
mine
for
this
for
i
was
very
weary
and
heavy
laden
i
thought
very
little
of
either
sleeping
or
eating
and
my
heart
was
filled
with
gratitude
since
i
knew
i
had
touched
the
hem
of
his
garment
i
must
add
that
the
reading
of

and
that

healed
me

i
became
very
much
impressed
with
the
truth
therein
stated
and
although
i
was
surrounded
with
opposition
i
knew
that
underneath
are
the
everlasting
arms
since
that
time
past
the
middle
of
the
year
i
have
kept
pressing
on
until
i
have
been
healed
by
reading
science
and
health
at
times
i
was
beset
by
what
seemed
unconquerable
opposition
until
the
first
week
in
october
when
upon
going
to
my
home
in
darien
for
a
visit
i
was
given
my
liberty
and
i
am
now
earning
my
living
in
this
city
after
having
been
subject
to
epileptic
attacks
since
and
at
one
time
pronounced
dying
by
the
doctor
in
charge
i
am
now
well
i
have
had
no
fit
or
symptoms
of
any
since
the
first
week
in
may
i
trust
that
this
testimony
to
the
healing
power
of
truth
realized
by
reading
science
and
health
for
i
had
no
treatment
may
reach
the
eye
of
some
to
whom
the
battle
seems
long
and
inspire
them
with
fresh
courage
and
a
realization
of
the
worth
of
the
victory
i
am
filled
with
inexpressible
gratitude
and
love
to
god
and
to

a
case
of
mental
surgery
i
have
felt
for
some
time
i
should
give
my
experience
in
mental
surgery
in
may
going
home
for
lunch
on
a
bicycle
and
while
riding
down
a
hill
at
a
rapid
gait
i
was
thrown
from
the
wheel
and
falling
on
my
left
side
with
my
arm
under
my
head
the
bone
was
broken
about
between
the
shoulder
and
elbow
while
the
pain
was
intense
i
lay
still
in
the
dust
declaring
the
truth
and
denying
that
there
could
be
a
break
or
accident
in
the
realm
of
divine
love
until
a
gentleman
came
to
assist
me
saying
he
thought
i
had
been
stunned
i
was
only
two
and
a
half
blocks
from
home
so
i
mounted
my
wheel
again
and
managed
to
reach
it
on
arriving
there
i
lay
down
and
asked
my
little
boy
to
bring
me
our
textbook
he
immediately
brought
science
and
health
which
i
read
for
about
ten
minutes
when
all
pain
left
i
said
nothing
to
my
family
of
the
accident
but
attended
to
some
duties
and
was
about
half
an
hour
late
in
returning
to
the
office
this
being
my
only
loss
of
time
from
work
my
friends
claimed
that
the
arm
had
not
been
broken
as
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
me
to
continue
my
work
without
having
it
set
and
carrying
it
in
a
sling
until
the
bone
knit
together
their
insistence
almost
persuaded
me
that
i
might
have
been
mistaken
until
one
of
my
friends
invited
me
to
visit
a
office
where
they
were
experimenting
with
an
machine
the
physician
was
asked
to
examine
my
left
arm
to
see
if
it
differed
from
the
ordinary
on
looking
through
it
he
said
yes
it
has
been
broken
but
whoever
set
it
made
a
perfect
job
of
it
and
you
will
never
have
any
further
trouble
from
that
break
my
friend
then
asked
the
doctor
to
show
how
he
could
tell
where
the
break
had
been
the
doctor
pointed
out
the
place
as
being
slightly
thicker
at
that
part
like
a
piece
of
steel
that
had
been
welded
this
was
the
first
of
several
cases
of
mental
surgery
that
have
come
under
my
notice
and
it
made
a
deep
impression
on
me
for
the
benefit
of
others
who
may
have
something
similar
to
meet
i
will
say
that
i
have
overcome
almost
constant
attacks
of
sick
headaches
extending
back
to
my
earliest
recollection
salt
lake
city
utah
cataract
quickly
cured
i
wish
to
add
my
testimony
to
those
of
others
and
hope
that
it
may
be
the
means
of
bringing
some
poor
sufferer
to
health
to
happiness
and
to
god
i
was
healed
through
simply
reading
this
wonderful
book
science
and
health
i
had
been
troubled
periodically
for
many
years
with
sore
eyes
and
had
been
to
many
doctors
who
called
the
disease
iritis
and
cataract
they
told
me
that
my
eyes
would
always
give
me
trouble
and
that
i
would
eventually
lose
my
sight
if
i
remained
in
an
office
and
advised
me
to
go
under
an
operation
later
on
i
had
to
wear
glasses
at
my
work
also
out
of
doors
as
i
could
not
bear
the
winds
and
my
eyes
were
gradually
becoming
worse
i
could
not
read
for
longer
than
a
few
minutes
at
a
time
otherwise
they
would
smart
severely
i
had
to
rest
my
eyes
each
evening
to
enable
me
to
use
them
the
next
day
in
fact
was
getting
unbearable
because
of
the
pain
and
i
made
home
miserable
a
dear
brother
told
me
about
christian
science
and
said
that
if
i
would
read
science
and
health
it
would
help
me
he
procured
for
me
the
loan
of
the
book
the
first
night
i
read
it
it
so
interested
me
i
quite
forgot
all
about
my
eyes
until
my
wife
remarked
that
it
was
eleven
i
found
that
i
had
been
reading
this
book
for
nearly
four
hours
and
i
remarked
immediately
after
i
believe
my
eyes
are
cured
which
was
really
the
case
the
next
day
on
looking
at
my
eyes
my
wife
noticed
that
the
cataract
had
disappeared
i
put
away
my
outdoor
glasses
which
i
have
not
required
since
and
through
the
understanding
gained
by
studying
christian
science
i
have
been
able
to
do
away
with
my
indoor
glasses
also
and
have
had
no
return
of
pain
in
my
eyes
since
this
is
now
a
year
and
a
half
ago
liverpool
england
valvular
heart
disease
healed
fourteen
years
ago
my
heart
awoke
to
gratitude
to
god
and
the
dear
leader
at
the
same
time
after
a
patient
and
persistent
effort
of
three
months
duration
to
procure
a
copy
of
science
and
health
during
which
time
i
had
visited
every
bookstore
and
many
of
the
bookstores
in
the
city
of
paul
and
had
failed
to
find
it
i
at
last
remembered
that
the
stranger
who
told
me
i
might
be
healed
had
mentioned
a
name
and
mcvicker
theatre
building
in
chicago
as
being
in
some
way
connected
with
the
work
i
sent
there
for
information
regarding
a
book
called
health
and
science
and
the
return
mail
brought
me
the
book
science
and
health
and
in
it
i
at
once
found
sure
promise
of
deliverance
from
valvular
heart
disease
with
all
the
accompaniments
such
as
extreme
nervousness
weakness
dyspepsia
and
insomnia
i
had
suffered
from
these
all
my
life
finding
no
permanent
relief
even
in
material
remedies
and
no
hope
of
cure
at
any
time
only
those
who
have
been
healed
in
such
bondage
and
have
been
liberated
by
the
same
means
can
know
the
eager
joy
of
the
first
perusal
of
that
wonderful
book
half
a
day
reading
convinced
me
that
i
had
found
the
way
to
holiness
and
health
i
read
on
thinking
only
of
the
spiritual
enlightenment
content
to
wait
until
i
should
be
led
to
some
person
who
would
heal
me
but
old
things
had
passed
away
and
all
things
had
become
new
i
was
completely
healed
before
i
had
met
a
scientist
or
one
who
knew
anything
about
christian
science
and
before
i
had
read
a
line
of
any
other
christian
science
literature
except
one
leaf
of
a
tract
so
it
is
absolutely
certain
that
the
healing
was
entirely
impersonal
as
was
also
the
teaching
which
enabled
me
to
begin
at
once
demonstrating
the
power
of
truth
to
destroy
all
forms
of
error
north
yakima
wash
the
true
physician
found
it
is
with
a
deep
sense
of
gratitude
that
i
send
the
particulars
of
my
healing
through
christian
science
while
visiting
friends
in
the
southwestern
part
of
ontario
about
three
years
ago
my
attention
was
called
to
christian
science
and
the
wonderful
healing
it
was
doing
i
had
lived
in
new
york
for
years
but
had
never
heard
of
christian
science
before
to
my
recollection
up
to
that
time
for
seventeen
years
i
had
suffered
with
indigestion
and
gastritis
in
the
worst
form
often
being
overcome
from
a
seeming
pressure
against
the
heart
i
had
asthma
for
four
years
also
had
worn
glasses
for
four
years
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
swallowed
every
known
medicine
to
relieve
my
indigestion
but
they
only
gave
me
temporary
benefit
i
purchased
a
copy
of
science
and
health
and
simply
from
the
reading
of
that
grand
book
i
was
completely
healed
of
all
my
physical
ailments
in
two
weeks
time
i
have
used
no
medicine
from
that
day
to
this
and
with
god
help
and
the
wonderful
light
revealed
to
me
through
the
reading
of
eddy
book
i
never
expect
to
again
i
used
to
smoke
eight
or
ten
cigars
a
day
and
also
took
an
occasional
drink
but
the
desire
for
these
has
gone
i
feel
forever
i
travel
on
the
road
and
am
constantly
being
invited
to
indulge
but
it
is
no
effort
to
abstain
and
in
many
instances
i
find
that
my
refusal
helps
others
while
i
fully
appreciate
the
release
from
my
physical
troubles
this
pales
into
insignificance
in
comparison
with
the
spiritual
uplifting
christian
science
has
brought
me
i
had
not
been
inside
a
church
for
more
than
ten
years
to
attend
regular
services
until
i
entered
a
christian
science
church
what
i
saw
and
realized
there
seemed
so
genuine
that
i
loved
christian
science
from
the
very
start
i
have
never
taken
a
treatment
every
inch
of
the
way
has
been
through
study
and
practical
demonstration
and
i
know
that
all
can
do
the
same
thing
if
they
will
try
since
i
have
been
in
science
i
have
overcome
a
case
of
ulcerated
tooth
in
one
night
through
the
reading
of
science
and
health
also
a
severe
attack
of
grip
in
hours
by
obeying
the
scripture
saying
physician
heal
thyself
new
york
y
cancer
and
consumption
healed
i
was
a
great
sufferer
for
many
years
from
internal
cancer
and
consumption
i
was
treated
by
the
best
of
physicians
in
new
york
minneapolis
and
duluth
and
was
finally
given
up
as
incurable
when
i
heard
of
christian
science
a
neighbor
who
had
been
healed
of
consumption
kindly
loaned
me
science
and
health
by
eddy
which
i
read
and
became
interested
in
in
three
months
time
i
was
healed
the
truth
conveyed
to
me
by
this
book
being
the
healer
and
not
only
of
these
diseases
but
i
was
made
whole
mentally
as
well
i
have
not
been
in
bed
one
day
since
or
rather
in
eleven
years
i
have
had
many
good
demonstrations
during
this
time
have
passed
through
many
a
fiery
trial
but
this
blessed
truth
has
caused
me
to
stand
at
times
seemingly
alone
and
god
was
with
me
i
will
mention
a
demonstration
of
painless
childbirth
which
i
have
had
since
coming
to
idaho
perhaps
it
may
help
some
sister
who
is
looking
through
the
for
a
demonstration
of
this
kind
as
i
was
before
my
baby
came
good
help
being
scarce
here
i
did
my
housework
up
to
the
time
i
was
confined
and
was
in
perfect
health
i
awoke
my
husband
one
morning
at
five
and
at
half
past
five
baby
was
born
no
one
being
present
but
my
husband
and
myself
it
was
quite
a
surprise
to
the
rest
of
the
family
to
see
me
sitting
by
the
fire
with
a
new
baby
on
my
lap
my
son
got
the
breakfast
of
which
i
ate
heartily
at
noon
i
joined
the
family
in
the
i
was
out
on
the
porch
the
second
day
around
the
yard
the
third
day
and
have
been
perfectly
well
ever
since
which
has
been
now
over
three
years
to
one
who
had
previously
passed
through
agony
untold
with
a
physician
in
attendance
this
seemed
wonderful
i
hope
this
will
interest
some
one
who
is
seeking
the
truth
and
i
wish
to
express
my
sincere
love
for
our
beloved
leader
who
has
given
us
the
key
to
the
scriptures
lewiston
idaho
a
remarkable
case
nine
years
ago
my
only
child
was
hovering
between
life
and
death
some
of
the
best
physicians
in
boston
had
pronounced
his
case
incurable
saying
that
if
he
lived
he
would
always
be
an
invalid
and
a
cripple
one
of
the
diseases
was
gastric
catarrh
he
was
allowed
to
eat
but
very
few
things
and
even
after
taking
every
precaution
he
suffered
to
the
extent
that
he
would
lie
in
spasms
for
half
a
day
he
also
had
rickets
physicians
saying
that
there
was
not
a
natural
bone
in
his
body
it
was
while
he
was
in
what
seemed
to
be
his
greatest
agony
and
when
i
was
in
the
darkest
despair
that
i
first
heard
of
christian
science
the
bearer
of
the
joyful
tidings
could
only
tell
me
to
come
and
hear
of
the
wonderful
things
that
christian
science
was
doing
i
accepted
the
invitation
for
i
was
willing
to
try
anything
to
save
my
child
and
the
following
friday
evening
i
attended
my
first
meeting
which
was
in
the
mother
church
of
christ
scientist
long
before
the
service
began
every
seat
was
filled
which
was
amazing
to
me
being
an
ordinary
weekly
meeting
and
that
night
i
realized
from
the
testimonies
given
that
christian
science
was
the
religion
for
which
i
had
been
searching
for
years
the
next
day
i
went
to
find
a
practitioner
but
was
unable
to
get
the
one
who
had
been
recommended
he
being
too
busy
on
my
way
home
i
thought
of
some
of
the
testimonies
which
i
had
heard
the
night
before
of
people
being
healed
by
simply
reading
science
and
health
i
resolved
at
once
to
borrow
a
copy
and
not
dreaming
of
the
sacrifice
that
my
friend
would
make
by
conferring
such
a
favor
i
went
and
asked
her
for
a
loan
of
science
and
health
i
never
saw
any
one
part
so
reluctantly
with
a
book
as
my
friend
did
with
her
copy
of
the
textbook
i
read
it
silently
and
audibly
day
and
night
in
my
home
and
although
i
could
not
seem
to
understand
it
yet
the
healing
commenced
to
take
place
at
once
the
little
mouth
which
had
been
twisted
by
spasms
grew
natural
and
the
child
was
soon
able
to
be
up
playing
and
romping
about
the
house
as
any
child
should
about
this
time
we
decided
to
move
to
the
far
west
i
was
young
in
science
at
the
time
and
my
husband
greatly
feared
that
the
journey
would
cause
a
relapse
for
the
child
but
instead
he
continued
to
improve
i
constantly
read
the
bible
science
and
health
and
miscellaneous
writings
the
two
weeks
we
traveled
and
we
were
the
only
ones
in
our
car
who
throughout
the
journey
did
not
get
train
sick
the
child
limbs
grew
perfectly
straight
he
ate
anything
he
wanted
and
for
years
he
has
been
a
natural
healthy
child
in
every
way
he
has
passed
through
some
of
the
worst
forms
of
contagion
untouched
and
unharmed
i
had
been
reading
science
and
health
several
months
before
i
gave
any
thought
to
myself
and
my
numerous
complaints
i
had
never
been
very
strong
and
some
of
my
ailments
were
supposed
to
be
hereditary
and
chronic
hence
i
dragged
through
many
tedious
years
with
a
belief
in
medical
laws
and
hereditary
laws
resting
upon
me
just
before
i
commenced
reading
science
and
health
i
spent
a
half
day
in
having
my
eyes
examined
by
one
of
the
leading
oculists
in
boston
his
verdict
was
that
my
eyes
were
in
a
dreadful
condition
and
that
i
would
always
need
to
wear
glasses
in
the
meantime
i
commenced
to
read
science
and
health
and
when
i
thought
of
my
eyes
i
had
no
need
for
glasses
the
years
that
i
have
been
in
science
i
have
used
my
eyes
incessantly
night
as
well
as
day
doing
all
kinds
of
trying
work
and
without
requiring
the
aid
of
glasses
i
was
healed
of
all
my
complaints
whilst
seeking
the
truth
for
my
child
and
many
of
them
have
never
returned
those
that
appeared
simply
came
to
the
surface
to
be
destroyed
teeth
have
been
restored
and
facial
blemishes
removed
unconsciously
simply
by
reading
science
and
health
all
of
this
is
however
nothing
to
compare
with
the
spiritual
uplifting
which
i
have
received
and
i
have
everything
to
be
thankful
for
los
angeles
cal
intense
suffering
overcome
for
about
five
years
i
was
afflicted
with
sciatic
rheumatism
in
such
a
severe
form
that
my
body
was
drawn
out
of
shape
when
able
to
be
around
i
walked
with
the
assistance
of
a
cane
the
attacks
were
periodical
recurring
every
few
months
any
exposure
to
rain
or
dampness
would
bring
one
at
one
time
i
was
in
bed
eleven
weeks
suffering
intensely
all
the
time
except
when
relieved
by
hypodermic
injections
when
i
had
these
attacks
my
regular
physician
was
always
in
attendance
my
daughter
consulted
another
physician
who
said
there
would
have
to
be
an
operation
which
would
include
the
exposing
and
scraping
of
the
sciatic
nerve
there
was
also
another
physician
who
knowing
of
the
case
examined
my
heart
and
claimed
that
it
was
weak
and
that
i
was
liable
to
pass
on
at
any
time
from
heart
trouble
after
suffering
three
years
i
heard
of
christian
science
but
did
not
avail
myself
of
it
for
two
years
when
i
decided
to
give
up
all
other
means
and
rely
wholly
upon
it
it
was
not
convenient
to
call
a
practitioner
so
i
took
science
and
health
and
applied
its
teachings
as
best
i
could
in
three
days
the
trouble
completely
left
me
and
there
has
never
been
the
slightest
return
my
health
has
been
good
ever
since
and
i
am
at
present
in
perfect
physical
health
i
have
been
benefited
in
every
way
by
christian
science
physically
mentally
and
spiritually
and
would
not
be
without
my
understanding
of
it
for
anything
billings
mont
healed
of
rheumatism
and
bright
disease
i
am
very
thankful
to
god
for
what
he
has
done
for
me
i
was
suddenly
left
alone
with
many
troubles
and
trials
and
i
took
up
the
study
of
the
bible
i
was
trying
to
understand
it
prior
to
joining
some
church
as
it
seemed
to
me
this
would
be
expected
i
had
attended
all
sorts
of
churches
from
my
childhood
up
but
never
could
find
any
that
met
my
need
as
time
passed
on
my
condition
became
very
alarming
sciatic
rheumatism
that
had
troubled
me
for
some
years
became
so
severe
i
could
scarcely
do
anything
then
there
appeared
some
complications
so
distressing
that
i
was
unable
to
walk
far
and
had
to
sit
down
frequently
by
the
way
i
thought
i
had
bright
disease
such
excruciating
pains
no
tongue
could
tell
my
sufferings
with
all
these
things
upon
me
death
seemed
very
near
i
had
never
joined
any
church
and
i
thought
it
now
too
late
as
i
would
have
to
wait
six
months
on
probation
and
i
would
be
dead
before
that
about
this
time
i
made
some
inquiries
of
my
sister
in
reference
to
christian
science
as
she
had
already
turned
to
that
faith
and
i
soon
found
that
it
was
just
what
i
had
been
looking
for
i
saw
at
once
that
it
declared
the
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
i
commenced
reading
science
and
health
also
the
new
testament
i
wanted
to
find
out
what
jesus
said
as
i
did
not
expect
then
to
live
long
i
did
not
go
to
the
meetings
nor
did
i
read
science
and
health
to
be
cured
not
thinking
of
that
but
to
be
saved
from
an
everlasting
hell
hereafter
my
sister
urged
me
to
have
a
practitioner
but
i
kept
on
reading
and
praying
to
god
in
silence
and
what
happened
where
had
the
diseases
gone
i
persisted
in
reading
science
and
health
together
with
the
bible
with
the
knowledge
that
god
as
revealed
by
christ
jesus
can
do
everything
that
he
made
everything
that
was
made
that
he
can
and
does
heal
the
afflicted
he
has
healed

christian
science
found
me
a
hopeless
invalid
i
had
suffered
for
seven
years
previous
with
a
very
painful
back
the
result
of
an
operation
i
could
get
no
rest
or
sleep
at
night
as
i
could
not
lie
down
but
had
to
sit
propped
in
a
chair
with
pillows
around
me
only
those
who
have
suffered
as
i
did
can
know
the
full
misery
of
it
i
had
come
to
the
end
of
material
means
and
never
hoped
to
get
well
one
day
however
while
out
walking
it
was
my
good
fortune
to
come
to
a
christian
scientist
house
and
there
the
teaching
was
explained
to
me
i
was
advised
to
buy
science
and
health
which
i
did
and
the
study
of
this
book
has
healed
my
back
entirely
christian
science
has
also
cured
me
of
catarrh
of
the
throat
and
neuralgia
with
which
i
had
been
afflicted
from
childhood
before
coming
into
science
i
had
doctored
with
three
of
the
best
physicians
in
seattle
but
none
could
give
me
relief
i
am
no
longer
a
sufferer
but
rejoice
exceedingly
in
christian
science
god

has
been
fulfilled

you

georgetown

freed
from
neurasthenic
and
other
troubles
christian
science
found
in
me
a
minister
son
who
had
failed
to
profit
by
continuous
teaching
in
the
old
thought
some
years
ago
i
was
pronounced
by
a
professor
of
whose
works
are
in
general
use
a
neurasthenic
i
had
been
in
this
condition
more
or
less
for
eight
years
and
up
to
two
years
ago
when
christian
science
was
first
brought
to
my
attention
thanks
to
almighty
god
through
a
kind
friend
i
was
almost
constantly
taking
medicine
and
had
in
all
eleven
physicians
who
undoubtedly
did
their
best
but
without
avail
withstanding
almost
all
known
drugs
were
prescribed
and
further
i
had
tried
very
many
patent
medicines
i
was
also
put
through
forms
of
hygienic
treatment
and
other
things
that
offered
inducements
at
the
time
of
coming
into
science
i
was
taking
three
times
daily
forty
minims
of
oil
and
three
of
creosote
also
three
drops
of
solution
of
arsenic
and
on
the
month
or
so
previous
had
bought
eighteen
dollars
worth
of
patent
medicine
i
was
restricted
to
the
simplest
means
of
diet
all
stews
fries
sweets
berries
and
tomatoes
i
had
not
touched
for
two
years
i
started
to
read
science
and
health
and
before
i
had
half
finished
the
book
once
i
was
eating
everything
that
any
one
does
i
read
the
book
eleven
times
straight
ahead
and
many
times
skipping
about
the
book
has
done
the
work
and
i
am

philadelphia
pa
many
ills
overcome
i
have
received
much
help
spiritually
and
physically
through
christian
science
i
had
what
the
doctors
diagnosed
as
muscular
rheumatism
dropsy
and
constipation
of
thirty
years
standing
a
dear
friend
whom
i
had
known
as
an
invalid
had
been
healed
by
christian
science
and
advised
me
to
read
science
and
health
i
did
so
having
a
desire
to
know
the
truth
one
of
my
troubles
was
that
i
could
not
sleep
i
began
reading
the
bible
and
the
christian
science
textbook
and
troubles
of
every
kind
disappeared
before
i
had
read
science
and
health
through
the
thought
came
what
about
the
old
remedies
but
truth
prevailed
and
i
took
all
the
material
remedies
i
had
and
threw
them
away
that
was
seven
years
ago
and
i
have
not
had
any
use
for
them
since
my
husband
was
healed
of
the
tobacco
habit
of
fifty
years
standing
also
of
kidney
trouble
by
reading
science
and
health
i
have
not
words
to
express
the
gratitude
i
feel
for
the
many
blessings
that
have
come
to
our
home
seattle
a
helpful
healing
i
became
interested
in
christian
science
about
eleven
years
ago
and
was
healed
of
neuralgia
of
the
stomach
from
which
i
had
suffered
from
a
child
as
i
grew
older
the
spells
became
more
frequent
and
more
severe
the
only
relief
physicians
could
give
me
was
by
hypodermic
injections
of
morphine
finally
after
each
spell
i
would
be
prostrated
for
a
day
or
two
with
the
of
the
morphine
i
was
entirely
healed
of
this
trouble
through
the
study
of
science
and
health
i
think
i
never
realized
what
fear
meant
until
i
began
to
try
and
put
into
practice
my
understanding
of
christian
science
for
my
children
i
have
proved
however
many
times
that
fear
can
neither
help
nor
hinder
in
our
demonstration
of
truth
the
first
time
i
realized
this
was
in
the
overcoming
of
a
severe
case
of
croup
for
my
little
boy
i
was
awakened
one
night
by
the
sound
that
seems
to
bring
terror
to
every
heart
and
found
the
little
fellow
sitting
up
in
bed
gasping
for
breath
i
got
up
took
him
in
my
arms
and
went
into
the
next
room
my
first
thought
was
o
if
only
there
was
another
christian
scientist
in
town
but
there
was
not
and
the
work
must
be
done
and
done
quickly
i
tried
to
treat
him
but
was
so
frightened
i
could
not
think
so
i
picked
up
science
and
health
which
lay
on
the
table
beside
me
and
began
reading
aloud
i
had
read
but
a
few
lines
when
these
words
came
to
me
as
though
a
voice
spoke
the
word
of
god
is
quick
and
powerful
and
sharper
than
any
sword
almost
immediately
after
the
little
one
said
mamma
sing
our
leader
hymn
that
both
the
big
and
the
little
children
love
i
began
singing
and
commencing
with
the
second
line
the
little
voice
joined
me
i
shall
never
forget
the
feeling
of
joy
and
peace
that
came
over
me
when
i
realized
how
quickly
god
word
through
science
and
health
and
the
beautiful
hymn
had
accomplished
the
healing
work
this
is
only
one
of
many
instances
in
which
the
power
of
god
word
to
heal
has
been
demonstrated
in
our
home

both
preventive
and

i
turn
to
that
wonderful
book

and
my
precious
bible
grown
dearer
since
read
in
the
new
light
of
spiritual
understanding
until
i
know
that
my
mind
is
renewed
because
the
action
is
changed
and
the
inflammation
has
abated
thus
in
my
experience
in
christian
science
i
have
seen
the
transformation
begun
and
truth
is
able
to
perfect
that
which
is
begun
in
me
so
gloriously
brooklyn
nova
scotia
health
and
peace
attained
for
fifteen
years
i
was
a
great
sufferer
physically
and
mentally
eminent
physicians
treated
me
for
hereditary
consumption
torpid
liver
and
many
other
diseases
i
sought
relief
at
famous
springs
the
ozone
of
florida
and
the
pure
air
of
colorado
but
in
vain
my
life
was
one
ceaseless
torture
during
all
this
time
however
i
was
an
earnest
seeker
after
truth
i
examined
every
religious
teaching
with
a
calm
and
unprejudiced
attention
from
an
orthodox
protestant
i
became
a
skeptic
and
a
follower
of
voltaire
tom
paine
and
ingersoll
yet
all
the
while
i
retained
faith
in
a
supreme
intelligent
being
who
made
all
sick
weary
doubting
and
despairing
i
accidentally
went
into
a
christian
science
church
in
new
york
city
on
a
wednesday
evening
not
knowing
what
kind
of
a
place
it
was
seeing
a
large
number
of
people
going
into
the
building
i
followed
supposing
that
a
marriage
ceremony
had
attracted
the
crowd
being
informed
it
was
their
regular
wednesday
evening
service
i
inquired
as
to
the
denomination
i
concluded
that
it
was
another
new
fad
but
after
investigation
i
procured
a
copy
of
science
and
health
promising
i
would
read
it
carefully
i
began
reading
the
book
on
tuesday
and
finished
on
friday
of
the
same
week
i
was
still
in
the
dark
i
laid
the
book
down
involuntarily
closed
my
eyes
and
silently
prayed
to
god
i
remained
in
that
attitude
a
few
moments
when
i
felt
like
the
mariner
who
had
been
tossed
for
days
upon
a
boisterous
sea
the
clouds
bending
low
the
billows
rolling
high
all
nature
wrapped
in
darkness
in
his
despair
he
kneels
and
commits
his
soul
to
god
when
he
suddenly
beholds
the
north
star
breaking
through
the
clouds
enabling
him
to
guide
his
ship
to
the
shores
of
safety
many
things
were
made
plain
to
me
i
saw
that
there
is
one
fatherhood
of
god
and
one
brotherhood
of
man
that
though
once
i
was
blind
now
i
see
that
there
was
no
more
pain
nor
aches
no
fear
nor
indigestion
i
slept
that
night
like
a
babe
and
awoke
next
morning
refreshed
there
are
now
no
traces
whatever
of
my
former
complaint
and
i
feel
like
a
new
being
new
york
y
health
and
peace
gained
about
nine
years
ago
i
was
drawn
to
christian
science
by
a
relative
whose
many
afflictions
had
given
place
to
health
and
harmony
and
whose
loving
gratitude
was
reflected
in
every
word
and
deed
the
thought
came
to
me
god
indeed
healeth
all
our
diseases
my
first
reading
of
science
and
health
was
without
understanding
i
was
full
of
darkness
and
gloom
and
it
was
laid
aside
for
a
time
the
good
seed
had
been
sown
however
and
erelong
the
reading
was
resumed
and
with
such
interest
that
my
afflictions
disappeared
like
mist
before
the
morning
sun
asthma
thought
to
be
hereditary
neuralgia
in
an
aggravated
form
and
besides
these
the
tobacco
and
liquor
habit
of
many
years
standing
left
me
bless
the
lord
he
sent
his
word
and
healed
me
for
the
reading
of
science
and
health
brought
to
my
consciousness
the
truth
that
makes
free
shellman
ga
consumption
quickly
cured
i
became
interested
in
christian
science
nearly
five
years
ago
through
the
healing
of
my
wife
of
what
the
doctors
called
consumption
in
its
last
stages
i
had
tried
everything
that
i
could
get
in
the
way
of
and
every
doctor
would
tell
me
nearly
the
same
story
about
the
case
at
last
they
recommended
for
her
only
a
higher
drier
climate
and
when
she
would
be
at
her
worst
to
give
her
something
to
quiet
her
i
tried
different
climates
but
she
was
no
better
indeed
worse
at
last
she
struggled
along
until
the
first
of
march
she
had
taken
to
her
bed
again
for
two
days
and
nights
she
suffered
and
i
called
a
physician
he
came
and
diagnosed
the
case
and
said
that
he
could
do
nothing
for
her
but
give
her
some
morphine
tablets
to
make
her
rest
i
gave
her
two
of
them
according
to
direction
and
just
before
the
time
to
give
her
the
third
she
called
me
to
her
bedside
and
said
do
give
me
any
more
of
that
stuff
for
it
does
me
more
harm
than
good
so
i
turned
and
placed
them
in
the
fire
though
i
did
not
then
know
anything
about
christian
science
we
had
heard
of
it
but
that
was
all
i
gave
her
the
last
tablet
at
eight
that
night
and
about
nine
the
next
day
a
lady
who
had
been
healed
in
christian
science
visited
her
and
introduced
her
to
this
great
truth
she
accepted
it
and
thought
she
would
try
it
the
lady
loaned
her
science
and
health
she
got
the
book
about
ten
that
day
and
read
it
until
dinner
was
called
she
ate
a
hearty
dinner
the
first
in
about
three
days
and
that
same
evening
she
dressed
herself
walked
into
the
ate
a
hearty
supper
and
enjoyed
it
she
slept
well
that
night
she
borrowed
this
lady
copy
of
science
and
health
two
hours
each
day
for
eight
days
and

tex
a
profitable
study
it
may
help
others
to
know
that
some
one
was
really
healed
of
severe
illness
through
christian
science
it
is
over
nine
years
since
we
first
became
interested
in
the
science
and
it
would
be
hard
to
find
a
healthier
person
than
i
am
now
i
can
go
all
day
from
morning
till
night
upheld
by
the
thought
that
they
that
wait
upon
the
lord
shall
renew
their
strength
i
can
truly
say
that
i
scarcely
know
what
physical
weariness
is
any
more
before
i
came
into
science
the
physicians
said
that
one
lung
was
gone
and
that
the
other
was
affected
with
tuberculosis
so
from
their
standpoint
there
was
little
left
for
me
to
hope
for
we
had
tried
every
remedy
that
they
had
suggested
i
had
gone
to
the
mountains
but
could
not
stay
there
on
account
of
the
altitude
and
when
they
did
not
know
what
else
to
do
they
said
we
would
better
go
to
england
that
the
ocean
air
would
be
beneficial
so
we
spent
three
months
in
the
british
isles
and
when
i
came
back
i
seemed
much
better
but
this
only
lasted
a
short
time
in
little
more
than
a
month
i
was
worse
than
ever
and
my
mother
was
told
that
i
had
but
a
few
weeks
or
at
most
months
to
live
at
that
time
a
lady
a
stranger
to
us
suggested
that
we
try
christian
science
there
was
no
prejudice
against
it
as
we
did
not
even
know
what
it
was
we
knew
of
no
scientists
in
the
western
town
where
we
were
living
and
when
we
were
told
that
we
could
send
to
kansas
city
for
absent
treatment
we
thought
it
was
absurd
we
were
then
told
that
many
people
had
been
healed
through
the
reading
of
the
christian
science
textbook
science
and
health
and
to
us
this
seemed
a
little
worse
than
the
absent
treatment
but
as
we
had
tried
everything
we
had
heard
of
up
to
that
time
my
mother
sent
for
the
book
it
came
in
the
middle
of
october
and
we
began
to
read
it
together
it
seemed
to
me
from
the
first
that
it
was
something
i
had
always
believed
but
did
not
know
how
to
express
it
seemed
such
a
natural
thing
my
improvement
was
very
gradual
but
i
felt
i
was
recovering
after
the
christmas
holidays
i
started
in
at
school
and
went
the
whole
term
without
missing
a
day
something
i
had
never
done
before
i
finished
my
school
course
without
missing
a
day
in
fact
i
have
not
spent
a
day
in
bed
since
that
time
i
feel
absolutely
certain
that
i
have
two
sound
healthy
lungs
now
the
hollows
in
my
chest
have
filled
out
and
i
breathe
perfectly
on
both
sides
rarely
have
a
cold
to
meet
and
have
not
a
sign
of
a
cough
people
sometimes
say
oh
well
maybe
you
never
had
consumption
well
i
had
all
the
symptoms
and
they
are
every
one
gone
through
the
reading
of
science
and
health
chicago
healed
of
infidelity
and
many
physical
ills
i
feel
compelled
to
write
my
testimony
and
hope
that
i
may
be
accepted
as
one
more
witness
to
the
truth
as
contained
in
science
and
health
with
key
to
the
scriptures
in
the
year
i
first
heard
of
christian
science
i
was
sitting
in
a
saloon
in
leadville
reading
a
daily
paper
of
that
place
my
eyes
lighted
upon
an
article
which
spoke
of
some
peculiar
people
in
boston
who
claimed
to
have
discovered
how
to
heal
as
jesus
healed
i
do
not
remember
much
of
the
article
but
those
words
stayed
with
me
i
had
drifted
out
to
colorado
from
new
york
city
my
home
where
i
had
been
under
the
treatment
of
many
leading
physicians
the
last
one
who
was
too
honest
to
take
my
money
knowing
that
he
could
not
cure
me
advised
me
to
keep
away
from
doctors
and
quit
taking
medicine
as
nothing
but
death
could
cure
me
my
trouble
was
pronounced
by
some
to
be
bright
disease
by
others
gravel
on
the
kidneys
with
very
acute
inflammation
of
the
bladder
and
prostate
gland
in
the
spring
of
my
wife
and
myself
were
spending
the
evening
at
the
house
of
a
gentleman
whose
wife
had
been
healed
in
the
east
by
christian
science
the
gentleman
took
a
book
from
its
bookcase
saying
here
is
a
work
on
christian
science
it
proved
to
be
science
and
health
i
knew
as
soon
as
i
had
read
the
that
this
was
the
very
book
we
wanted
we
immediately
sent
for
the
book
and
when
it
arrived
we
obeyed
the
angel
and
feasted
on
it
i
was
very
much
prejudiced
against
the
bible
and
my
first
demonstration
over
self
was
to
consent
to
read
the
four
gospels
my
wife
bought
me
a
new
testament
and
i
began
to
read
it
what
a
change
came
over
me
all
my
prejudice
was
gone
in
an
instant
when
i
read
the
master
words
i
caught
his
meaning
and
the
lesson
he
tried
to
convey
it
was
not
difficult
for
me
to
accept
the
whole
bible
for
i
could
not
help
myself
i
was
just
captured
the
disease
with
which
i
had
been
troubled
for
years
tormented
me
worse
than
ever
for
about
six
months
as
if
trying
to
turn
me
aside
but
i
lost
all
fear
of
it
i
kept
up
my
study
of
science
and
health
and
the
disease
disappeared
i
can
honestly
say
that
science
and
health
was
my
only
healer
and
it
has
been
my
only
teacher
los
angeles
cal
diseased
eyes
cured
christian
science
came
to
me
when
i
was
a
wreck
my
body
being
completely
covered
with
sores
my
eyes
were
very
bad
so
that
i
sat
in
a
darkened
room
for
weeks
together
most
of
the
time
in
bed
under
opiates
the
home
doctor
and
a
specialist
said
the
disease
of
the
eyes
could
not
be
cured
though
they
might
help
me
for
a
while
i
had
one
operation
and
the
doctor
said
if
i
took
cold
i
would
become
totally
blind
my
suffering
was
beyond
telling
a
clergyman
called
almost
every
day
and
sat
by
my
bed
and
wept
and
my
good
kind
doctor
shed
tears
many
times
finally
after
a
year
of
this
terrible
suffering
i
was
sent
to
indiana
to
a
sister
who
had
been
healed
of
lung
trouble
by
christian
science
the
first
day
i
was
there
she
read
to
me
from
the
bible
and
from
science
and
health
with
key
to
the
scriptures
by
eddy
and
i
was
healed
i
knew
that
god
was
no
respecter
of
persons
and
when
i
saw
what
had
been
done
for
my
sister
who
was
changed
from
being
a
mere
frame
to
a
strong
robust
healthy
woman
the
cough
all
gone
i
said
god
has
as
much
for
me
if
i
will
accept
it
i
was
healed
instantaneously
by
christian
science
and
am
thankful
to
god
for
giving
us
this
understanding
through
eddy

beloved
leader

am
now
in
perfect
health

textbook

me
for
twelve
years
previous
to
the
fall
of
i
had
been
under
the
care
of
a
physician
much
of
the
time
different
opinions
were
given
by
them
as
to
the
nature
of
the
trouble
some
diagnosing
it
as
an
abnormal
growth
etc
i
was
healed
through
reading
science

health
with
key
to
the
scriptures
by
eddy
it
was
a
clear
case
of
transformation
of
the

the
renewal
of
the
mind
i
am
perfectly
well
at
the
present

omaha
neb
obstinate

trouble
healed
there
is
no
doubt
that
by
far
the
greater
number
come
to
christian
science
by
the
way
of
physical
healing
but
there
are
those
to
whom
this
does
not
particularly
appeal
in
the
hope
that
it
may
be
of
benefit
to
some
such
and
in
gratitude
for
help
received
i
submit
my
own
experience
three
years
ago
i
knew
nothing
of
christian
science
aside
from
the
knowledge
gathered
from
the
daily
papers
and
current
literature
when
i
thought
of
the
subject
at
all
it
was
to
class
christian
science
with
various
human
theories
with
which
i
could
not
be
in
sympathy
for
they
seemed
to
rely
upon
both
good
and
evil
i
had
never
known
of
a
case
of
healing
had
never
read
the
textbook
or
heard
of
the
or
but
i
would
sometimes
see
people
going
into
the
christian
science
church
i
was
tired
of
trying
to
find
anything
satisfactory
in
religious
belief
for
it
seemed
as
if
god
either
could
not
or
would
not
bring
into
harmony
the
terrible
conditions
existing
in
human
society
i
had
quit
using
any
form
of
prayer
except
the
lord
prayer
and
even
then
omitted
the
words
lead
us
not
into
temptation
how
i
longed
to
know
just
a
little
of
the
why
and
wherefore
of
it
all
here
is
where
christian
science
found
me
i
was
thrown
in
contact
with
a
dear
friend
of
whom
i
had
seen
very
little
for
a
year
or
more
a
thoroughly
educated
woman
and
a
thinker
she
told
me
she
had
taken
some
treatments
in
christian
science
for
a
physical
trouble
and
had
become
very
much
interested
in
the
study
of
science
and
health
with
key
to
the
scriptures
by
eddy
she
asked
me
if
i
would
like
to
look
at
the
book
and
i
said
i
would
be
glad
to
do
so
the
first
chapter
prayer
appealed
to
me
from
the
first
and
when
i
came
to
eddy
spiritual
sense
of
the
lord
prayer
science
and
health
my
interest
was
fully
aroused
i
knew
that
in
a
dim
way
i
was
learning
what
it
means
to
pray
without
ceasing
very
soon
i
bought
a
book
of
my
own
and
with
the
help
of
our
as
given
in
the
i
began
in
earnest
the
study
of
science
and
health
in
connection
with
the
bible
i
stood
very
much
in
need
of
physical
healing
at
this
time
having
suffered
for
several
years
from
an
obstinate
form
of
stomach
trouble
so
far
as
i
know
i
gave
no
thought
to
the
benefits
i
might
derive
physically
from
the
study
but
i
did
believe
this
science
held
the
truth
of
things
and
i
was
so
absorbed
in
getting
an
understanding
of
the
principle
that
i
thought
very
little
of
myself
after
about
three
or
four
months
study
i
realized
that
the
stomach
trouble
was
gone
and
with
it
went
other
physical
troubles
which
have
never
returned
this
healing
was
brought
about
by
the
earnest
conscientious
seeking
for
the
truth
as
contained
in
the
bible
and
interpreted
by
our
leader
in
our
textbook
science
and
health
i
have
since
learned
more
of
the
science
of
healing
and
have
been
able
in
a
small
way
to
help
others
in
need
i
have
also
learned
that
in
living
and
loving
is
healing
realized
and
in
reflecting
divine
love
i
have
the
signs
following
when
we
think
of
the
pure
loving
unselfish
life
eddy
must
have
lived
in
order
to
become
conscious
of
this
truth
and
give
it
to
us
words
are
a
poor
medium
through
which
to
express
the
gratitude
which
her
followers
feel
for
her
it
is
best
expressed
by
obediently
following
her
even
as
she
is
following
christ
omaha
neb
dyspepsia
quickly
healed
it
has
occurred
to
me
that
i
have
had
ample
time
to
meditate
on
the
many
blessings
which
i
have
received
through
christian
science
as
it
is
now
more
than
six
years
since
i
was
entirely
healed
of
dyspepsia
as
well
as
constipation
in
its
worst
form
by
the
reading
of
science
and
health
so
aggravated
were
the
conditions
that
for
three
years
or
more
i
was
unable
to
drink
a
glass
of
cold
water
everything
that
i
drank
had
to
be
hot
and
my
only
means
of
relief
from
the
bowel
trouble
was
hot
water
injections
for
a
period
of
more
than
three
years
i
can
truthfully
say
that
i
was
permanently
and
i
might
say
instantly
healed
of
those
two
ailments
by
reading
science
and
health
as
before
stated
and
in
fact
i
do
not
think
i
had
read
more
than
thirty
pages
of
this
book
when
i
ignored
entirely
the
most
rigid
kind
of
diet
i
ate
and
drank
everything
i
wished
without
a
single
harmful
effect
from
that
time
to
this
date
and
there
has
not
been
a
drop
of
medicine
in
our
home
for
more
than
six
years
in
a
family
of
five
i
have
also
seen
the
power
of
truth
manifested
in
our
home
by
having
our
youngest
child
relieved
of
the
most
excruciating
pain
and
changed
to
his
most
playful
mood
immediately
upon
notifying
one
of
the
faithful
practitioners
of
this
city
for
all
this
i
am
endeavoring
to
be
thankful
to
god
and
to
our
faithful
leader
eddy
whose
pure
and
undefiled
life
enabled
her
to
discover
this
precious
truth
for
the
benefit
of
all
mankind
c
denver
after
twenty
years
suffering
from
early
girlhood
i
was
considered
an
invalid
having
been
injured
by
a
hard
fall
while
playing
the
pain
was
intense
for
some
time
and
for
several
hours
i
was
unable
to
walk
or
stand
alone
later
a
growing
weakness
of
the
back
accompanied
with
sharp
pains
alarmed
my
parents
who
called
a
physician
and
he
pronounced
it
spinal
trouble
then
followed
nearly
twenty
years
of
increased
suffering
at
times
very
severe
as
years
went
by
and
i
became
a
wife
and
mother
my
suffering
increased
everything
that
medical
skill
could
do
was
done
but
finding
no
lasting
benefit
from
anything
i
lost
hope
of
recovery
when
christian
science
found
me
i
was
under
the
doctor
sentence
that
if
i
lived
the
week
through
i
would
become
entirely
helpless
not
able
to
move
hand
or
foot
my
husband
was
a
travelling
man
and
being
urgently
called
home
he
met
an
old
friend
on
the
train
who
asked
why
we
did
not
try
christian
science
the
reply
we
know
nothing
of
it
was
followed
by
a
brief
explanation
of
its
healing
power
and
the
benefit
his
family
had
received
this
inspired
my
husband
with
new
hope
and
on
his
arrival
at
home
he
called
on
a
practitioner
who
recommended
our
getting
science
and
health
which
we
did
but
ignorance
and
the
prejudice
of
old
education
produced
such
fear
that
i
hid
the
book
under
the
covers
of
the
bed
whenever
the
children
came
into
the
room
fearing
that
it
was
not
of
god
and
would
injure
them
god
dear
love
was
however
more
potent
than
these
foolish
fears
and
the
first
day
i
read
from
its
sacred
pages
i
was
convinced
its
teachings
were
the
same
truths
as
jesus
christ
had
taught
centuries
ago
when
i
had
read
a
few
pages
i
reached
out
and
threw
my
medicine
from
the
open
window
at
the
head
of
my
bed
i
then
turned
back
to
the
book
and
began
reading
again
when
lo
the
dawned
upon
me
and
i
was
healed
instantaneously
i
first
noticed
the
spot
in
my
back
cooling
and
soon
i
got
out
of
bed
i
continued
to
read
eagerly
i
felt
as
if
i
wanted
to
devour
the
healing
truth
and
drank
it
in
as
a
thirsty
plant
does
the
gentle
rain
when
dinner
was
prepared
i
walked
out
and
ate
a
hearty
meal
with
the
family
to
the
amazement
of
all
we
shall
never
forget
what
a
joyful
meal
this
was
how
we
did
thank
god
for
christian
science
as
year
after
year
has
gone
by
till
twenty
years
have
passed
and
the
healing
has
remained
perfect
i
have
grown
to
thank
god
with
deeper
sincerity
that
one
brave
woman
was
found
pure
enough
to
bring
forth
this
again
to
remain
forever
among
men
and
to
save
suffering
humanity
from
all
disease
and
sin
fairmont
from
despair
to
hope
and
joy
i
have
often
had
a
desire
to
make
public
what
christian
science
has
done
for
me
but
i
never
could
tell
of
all
my
blessings
they
are
so
many
from
childhood
i
was
always
sick
never
knew
one
hour
of
rest
and
was
under
the
doctor
care
most
of
the
time
i
was
living
in
the
east
at
that
time
and
was
advised
to
try
change
of
climate
which
i
did
i
came
west
with
my
family
in
the
spring
of
the
year
but
instead
of
growing
better
i
grew
steadily
worse
until
at
last
i
was
obliged
to
keep
my
bed
for
nearly
three
years
a
great
sufferer
my
ailments
were
it
seemed
all
that
flesh
is
heir
to
and
were
called
incurable
by
the
doctors
bright
disease
and
many
others
in
the
last
stages
my
case
was
known
among
physicians
many
of
whom
were
prominent
specialists
as
a
most
extreme
one
many
upon
looking
at
me
would
turn
away
with
a
wise
shake
of
the
head
and
say
what
keeps
her
alive
my
physicians
who
were
exceedingly
kind
and
did
all
that
lay
within
their
power
for
me
gave
me
up
and
the
death
sentence
was
pronounced
on
me
by
all
who
attended
me
it
was
then
i
realized
that
man
extremity
is
god
opportunity
the
little
book
was
handed
me
at
this
hour
of
great
need
i
read
it
not
thinking
it
would
heal
me
but
like
a
drowning
man
i
grasped
at
it
i
read
it
read
it
again
and
soon
found
myself
growing
stronger
then
i
kept
on
reading
and
was
perfectly
healed
of
all
the
supposedly
incurable
diseases
austin

truth
makes
free
as
the
son
of
a
physician
a
graduate
in
pharmacy
and
an
i
had
a
perfect
contempt
for
what
i
thought
christian
science
to
be
about
six
and
a
half
years
ago
however
having
exhausted
all
material
means
at
my
command
electricity
gymnastics
cycling
and
so
on
and
being
in
a
hopeless
state
the
study
of
christian
science
was
taken
up
i
had
been
a
sufferer
from
catarrh
and
sore
throat
for
over
thirty
years
and
in
the
last
five
were
added
several
others
including
dyspepsia
and
bronchitis
and
a
loss
in
flesh
of
sixty
pounds
i
was
completely
healed
and
regained
health
strength
and
flesh
through
the
spiritual
understanding
of
christian
science
the
result
of
about
six
weeks
study
this
good
and
perfect
gift
came
to
me
through
the
careful
and
prayerful
study
of
christian
science
as
revealed
to
the
world
through
science
and
health
the
promise
of
christ
jesus
the
truth
shall
make
you
free
was
fulfilled
and
the
past
six
years
of
health
and
harmony
have
been
spent
in
striving
to
hold
fast
that
which
is
good
while
most
grateful
for
the
physical
healing
my
gratitude
for
the
mental
and
spiritual
regeneration
is
beyond
expression
when
i
learned
that
jesus
mission
of
healing
sickness
as
well
as
sin
did
not
end
with
his
short
stay
upon
earth
but
is
practical
in
all
ages
my
joy
was
unbounded
having
spent
thousands
in
the
old
way
it
seemed
wonderful
to
be
healed
at
such
small
cost
as
the
price
of
the
little
book
and
a
few
weeks
study
every
thought
of
prejudice
immediately
vanished
before
the
proofs
that
christian
science
is
indeed
the
elucidation
and
practical
application
of
jesus
teachings
which
are
demonstrable
truth
the
same
yesterday
and
and
forever
memphis
tenn
deaf

unstopped
as
a
mother
of
a
family
my
heart
goes
out
in
love
and
gratitude
to
that
good
woman
we
are
privileged
to
call
our
leader
for
all
she
has
done
through
her
book
for
me
and
mine
ten
years
ago
i
was
healed
of
hereditary
deafness
and
catarrh
of
the
head
simply
through
reading
the
book
science
and
health
for
years
previous
i
had
consulted
and
taken
treatment
from
some
of
the
best
specialists
for
the
ear
and
throat
both
in
england
and
america
but
grew
worse
all
the
time
i
was
then
urged
by
a
lady
who
had
been
healed
through
christian
science
to
buy
this
book
and
study
it
i
did
so
very
reluctantly
but
had
not
read
fifty
pages
before
i
felt
i
had
indeed
found
the
truth
which
makes
free
and
can
truly
say
from
that
time
i
have
never
had
a
return
of
the
ailment
that
for
which
i
am
however
most
grateful
is
the
daily
help
it
is
to
me
in
my
household
of
young
children
i
am
sure
if
mothers
only
knew
what
christian
science
truly
means
they
would
give
all
they
possess
to
know
it
we
have
seen
croup
measles
fever
and
various
other
children
complaints
disappear
like
dew
before
the
morning
sun
through
the
application
of
christian
science
the
understanding
of
god
as
and
omnipotent
it
has
been
proven
to
me
without
a
doubt
that
god
is
a
very
present
help
in
trouble
and
what
a
blessed
help
this
wonderful
truth
is
in
the
training
of
our
children
and
how
quickly
the
child
grasps
it
some
time
ago
my
little
girl
then
three
years
old
dislocated
her
shoulder
i
was
alone
in
the
house
at
the
time
the
pain
was
so
intense
that
she
became
faint
i
treated
her
the
best
i
knew
how
but
kept
holding
the
thought
that
just
as
soon
as
some
one
came
i
would
run
for
help
she
seemed
to
grow
worse
and
cried
very
much
i
undressed
her
and
tried
to
twist
the
arm
into
place
but
it
caused
such
suffering
that
i
began
to
get
afraid
then
like
a
flash
came
the
thought
what
would
you
do
if
you
were
out
of
the
reach
of
a
practitioner
now
is
your
time
to
prove
god
power
and
presence
with
these
thoughts
came
such
a
sense
of
calm
and
trustfulness
that
i
lost
all
fear
i
then
asked
the
child
if
i
should
read
to
her
she
said
yes
mamma
read
the
i
began
reading
aloud
to
her
from
science
and
health
in
about
half
an
hour
i
noticed
she
tried
to
lift
the
arm
but
screamed
and
became
very
pale
i
continued
to
read
aloud
and
again
she
made
an
effort
to
put
some
candy
into
her
mouth
this
time
i
noticed
with
joy
that
she
almost
reached
her
mouth
before
she
felt
the
pain
i
kept
reading
aloud
to
her
until
my
sister
and
two
boys
came
in
when
she
jumped
off
her
bed
so
delighted
to
see
her
brothers
that
she
forgot
her
arm
she
then
began
to
tell
her
aunt
that
she
had
broken
her
arm
and
mamma
treated
it
with
the
when
this
happened
it
was
about
and
by
she
was
playing
out
doors
as
though
nothing
had
ever
happened
winnipeg
man
saved
from
insanity
and
suicide
a
few
years
ago
while
under
a
sense
of
darkness
and
despair
caused
by
ill
health
and
an
unhappy
home
science
and
health
was
loaned
me
with
a
request
that
i
should
read
it
at
that
time
my
daughter
was
given
up
by
to
die
of
lingering
consumption
supposed
to
have
been
inherited
my
own
condition
seemed
even
more
alarming
as
insanity
was
being
manifested
and
rather
than
go
to
an
insane
asylum
it
seemed
to
me
the
only
thing
to
do
was
to
commit
suicide
heart
trouble
kidney
complaint
and
continual
headaches
caused
from
female
trouble
were
some
of
the
many
ailments
i
had
to
contend
with
my
doctor
tried
to
persuade
me
to
undergo
an
operation
as
a
means
of
relief
but
i
had
submitted
to
a
severe
operation
ten
years
previous
and
found
only
additional
suffering
as
a
result
so
i
would
not
consent
when
i
began
with
science
and
health
i
read
the
chapter
on
prayer
first
and
at
that
time
did
not
suppose
it
possible
for
me
to
remember
anything
i
read
but
felt
a
sweet
sense
of
god
protection
and
power
and
a
hope
that
i
should
at
last
find
him
to
be
what
i
so
much
needed
a
present
help
in
time
of
trouble
before
that
chapter
on
prayer
was
finished
my
daughter
was
downstairs
eating
three
meals
a
day
and
daily
growing
stronger
before
i
had
finished
reading
the
textbook
she
was
well
but
never
having
heard
that
the
reading
of
science
and
health
healed
any
one
it
was
several
months
before
i
gave
god
the
glory
one
by
one
my
many
ailments
left
me
all
but
the
headaches
they
were
less
frequent
until
at
the
end
of
three
years
the
fear
of
them
was
entirely
overcome
neither
myself
nor
my
daughter
have
ever
received
treatments
but
the
study
of
the
bible
and
science
and
health
the
christian
science
textbook
by
eddy
has
healed
us
and
keeps
us
well
while
christian
science
was
very
new
to
me
i
attended
an
experience
meeting
in
first
church
of
christ
scientist
chicago
a
gentleman
told
of
an
unhappy
woman
who
was
about
to
separate
from
her
husband
this
gentleman
had
asked
her
if
she
did
not
love
her
husband
she
replied
no
when
i
married
him
i
did
but
not
now
he
told
her
god
made
man
in
his
image
and
likeness
and
that
he
is
perfect
he
said
to
her
go
home
and
see
only
god
perfect
man
you
do
need
to
love
a
sinful
mortal
such
as
you
have
been
looking
upon
the
lady
followed
his
advice
as
he
told
her
there
is
no
separation
in
divine
mind
in
a
short
time
peace
and
harmony
were
in
her
home
and
both
husband
and
wife
became
members
of
a
christian
science
church
this
testimony
was
like
a
message
from
heaven
to
me
i
had
received
many
benefits
from
the
study
of
science
and
health
but
it
had
never
dawned
upon
my
darkened
consciousness
till
then
how
wonderful
our
god
is
i
knew
what
had
taken
place
in
that
home
could
take
place
in
my
unhappy
home
where
there
was
neither
rest
nor
peace
i
hopefully
took
up
my
cross
and
step
by
step
my
burden
grew
lighter
as
i
journeyed
along
realizing
the
presence
of
the
christ
truth
that
indeed
makes
us
free
not
all
at
once
did
any
outward
change
appear
but
at
the
end
of
three
years
all
was
peace
all
the
members
of
the
family
attending
church
together
and
realizing
that
there
is
but
one
mind
j
superior
stomach
trouble
healed
i
was
healed
of
stomach
trouble
of
many
years
standing
by
reading
science
and
health
my
condition
had
reached
the
stage
in
which
i
had
periodical
attacks
that
came
on
with
greater
frequency
i
was
a
travelling
salesman
and
it
was
a
common
occurrence
for
me
to
have
to
call
a
physician
to
my
hotel
to
administer
morphine
for
an
acute
form
of
this
disease
this
became
a
regular
thing
at
certain
places
and
these
attacks
always
left
me
worse
than
before
as
a
result
of
the
last
one
i
lost
a
great
deal
in
weight
i
had
tried
many
physicians
and
most
of
the
usual
remedies
during
these
years
of
suffering
without
any
good
result
finally
as
a
last
resort
i
decided
to
try
christian
science
and
i
was
healed
by
reading
science
and
health
with
key
to
the
scriptures
by
eddy
my
health
has
been
of
the
best
since
i
was
healed
now
six
years
ago
in
the
family
we
have
depended
entirely
on
christian
science
for
our
healing
and
have
ever
found
it
efficacious
we
consider
the
physical
healing
however
only
incidental
to
the
understanding
of
god
and
his
goodness
this
together
with
our
increased
love
for
the
bible
is
proving
most
valuable
to
us
we
are
humbly
trying
to
live
the
lives
that
will
prove
our
gratitude
to
god
and
to
our
beloved
leader

vt
freed
from
many
years
of
suffering
in
the
spring
of
i
was
taken
down
with
a
severe
attack
of
stomach
trouble
was
bedfast
for
three
months
and
not
able
to
drive
out
for
nearly
six
months
during
this
time
i
had
three
good
doctors
treating
me
i
gained
a
little
in
strength
but
had
very
little
relief
from
the
stomach
trouble
i
was
recommended
to
try
mineral
springs
and
did
so
but
with
the
same
disappointment
i
went
to
a
sanitarium
but
yet
the
stomach
trouble
prevailed
i
had
some
friends
who
recommended
patent
medicines
but
no
healing
came
i
worried
along
in
this
way
for
several
years
finally
i
read
medicine
nearly
two
years
with
a
good
doctor
friend
especially
for
my
own
benefit
and
during
this
time
i
had
a
severe
attack
of
bladder
trouble
and
for
fifteen
years
i
suffered
so
severely
at
times
that
i
thought
life
was
not
really
worth
living
in
connection
with
these
troubles
i
suffered
every
winter
with
rheumatism
and
the
grip
i
also
had
a
growth
coming
on
both
eyes
called
cataract
which
caused
my
eyes
to
be
inflamed
nearly
all
the
time
and
this
growth
had
made
such
progress
that
it
was
causing
my
vision
to
be
very
dim
when
reading
corns
were
not
forgotten
as
i
was
reminded
of
them
very
frequently
and
for
all
these
troubles
i
had
tried
every
remedy
i
heard
of
that
i
was
able
to
get
specialists
included
without
relief
thanks
to
a
friend
who
took
me
in
this
hopeless
discouraged
condition
and
led
me
to
the
light
that
never
knows
darkness
i
got
a
copy
of
science
and
health
by
eddy
and
was
healed
in
a
short
time
by
reading
this
work
anderson
ind
relief
from
intense
suffering
i
became
interested
in
christian
science
in
for
four
or
five
years
i
had
suffered
with
severe
attacks
which
nothing
but
an
opiate
seemed
to
relieve
after
one
which
i
think
was
the
worst
i
ever
had
i
consulted
our
family
physician
who
diagnosed
my
case
as
a
dangerous
kidney
disease
and
said
that
no
medicine
could
help
me
but
that
i
must
undergo
a
surgical
operation
i
continued
to
grow
worse
and
went
to
see
the
physician
again
and
he
advised
me
to
consult
a
doctor
who
was
connected
with
the
city
hospital
of
augusta
this
doctor
made
an
examination
and
diagnosed
the
difficulty
as
something
different
but
quite
as
serious
meanwhile
a
friend
offered
me
a
copy
of
science
and
health
i
said
i
did
not
care
to
read
the
book
but
she
was
so
urgent
that
i
finally
promised
to
do
so
i
received
the
book
on
saturday
and
on
sunday
morning
i
sat
down
to
read
it
when
i
reached
the
place
where
eddy
says
she
found
this
truth
in
the
bible
i
began
comparing
the
two
books
i
read
passages
which
looked
very
reasonable
to
me
and
said
to
myself
this
is
nearer
to
the
truth
than
anything
i
have
ever
seen
i
continued
to
read
all
day
stopping
only
long
enough
to
eat
my
dinner
as
i
read
on
everything
became
clearer
to
me
and
i
felt
that
i
was
healed
during
the
evening
a
neighbor
came
in
and
i
said
i
am
healed
and
that
book
has
healed
me
i
read
on
and
was
certainly
healed
eight
days
after
my
healing
i
did
my
own
washing
this
occurred
in
february
about
six
weeks
after
i
was
called
to
care
for
my
mother
who
was
under
the
care
of
my
former
physician
i
again
let
him
examine
my
side
as
he
wished
to
see
if
the
trouble
was
still
there
he
said
it
is
certainly
gone
i
said
to
him
doctor
you
told
me
i
would
never
be
a
well
woman
unless
i
was
operated
upon
what
has
healed
me
he
replied
god
has
healed
you
north
pittston
me
grateful
for
many
blessings
it
is
with
sincere
gratitude
for
the
many
blessings
christian
science
has
brought
me
that
i
give
this
testimony
i
first
heard
of
christian
science
about
fifteen
years
ago
a
friend
of
mine
was
taking
treatment
for
physical
troubles
and
was
reading
the
textbook
of
christian
science
science
and
health
with
key
to
the
scriptures
the
title
of
the
book
appealed
to
me
very
strongly
i
said
to
my
friend
if
that
is
a
key
to
the
scriptures
i
must
have
it
i
had
long
been
a
member
of
a
bible
class
in
an
orthodox
sabbath
school
but
i
never
felt
satisfied
with
that
which
was
taught
there
was
something
lacking
i
did
not
understand
then
what
it
was
i
purchased
a
copy
of
science
and
health
and
began
to
study
it
i
wish
i
could
express
in
words
what
that
book
brought
me
it
illumined
the
bible
with
a
glorious
light
and
i
began
to
understand
some
of
the
master
sayings
and
tried
to
apply
them
i
had
had
a
longing
to
live
a
better
christian
life
for
many
years
and
often
wondered
why
i
failed
so
utterly
to
understand
the
bible
now
i
knew
it
was
lack
of
spiritual
apprehension
i
did
not
know
at
first
that
people
were
healed
of
disease
and
sin
by
simply
reading
science
and
health
but
found
after
a
while
that
such
was
the
case
at
that
time
i
had
many
physical
troubles
and
one
after
another
of
these
ills
simply
disappeared
and
i
found
that
i
had
no
disease
i
was
perfectly
free
the
spiritual
uplifting
was
glorious
too
and
as
i
go
on
in
the
study
of
this
blessed
science
i
find
i
am
gaining
surely
an
understanding
that
helps
me
to
overcome
both
sin
and
disease
in
myself
and
in
others
my
faith
in
good
is
increased
and
i
know
i
am
losing
my
belief
in
evil
as
a
power
equal
to
good
the
pathway
is
not
wearisome
because
each
victory
over
self
gives
stronger
faith
and
a
more
earnest
desire
to
press

toledo
ohio
grateful
for
moral
and
spiritual
awakening
about
four
years
ago
after
i
had
tried
different
ways
and
means
to
be
relieved
from
bodily
suffering
a
faithful
friend
called
my
attention
to
the
teaching
of
christian
science
after
some
opposition
i
decided
to
investigate
it
with
the
thoughtthat
if
this
teaching
would
be
helpful
it
was
meant
for
me
as
well
as
for
others
if
it
did
not
afford
any
help
i
could
put
it
aside
again
but
that
i
would
find
out
and
be
convinced
after
i
had
read
eddy
work
science
and
health
a
few
days
i
found
that
my
ailments
had
disappeared
and
a
rest
had
come
to
me
which
i
had
never
before
known
i
had
smoked
almost
incessantly
although
i
had
often
determined
to
use
my
will
power
and
never
smoke
again
but
had
always
failed
this
desire
as
well
as
the
desire
for
drink
simply
disappeared
and
i
wish
to
say
here
that
i
received
all
these
benefits
before
i
had
gained
much
understanding
of
what
i
was
reading
like
a
prisoner
who
had
been
in
chains
for
years
i
was
suddenly
set
free
i
did
not
then
know
how
the
chain
had
been
removed
but
i
had
to
acknowledge
that
it
came
through
the
reading
of
this
book
i
then
felt
an
ardent
desire
to
read
more
and
to
know
what
this
power
was
that
had
freed
me
in
a
few
days
of
that
which
i
had
been
trying
for
years
to
shake
off
and
had
failed
it
then
became
clear
to
me
that
this
was
the
truth
which
jesus
christ
taught
and
preached
to
free
humanity
almost
two
thousand
years
ago
it
did
not
however
occur
to
me
to
apply
it
in
my
business
affairs
on
the
contrary
i
first
thought
that
if
i
continued
in
my
study
i
would
have
to
retire
from
business
this
did
not
happen
however
for
i
gradually
found
that
the
little
understanding
of
this
wonderful
teaching
which
i
had
acquired
became
a
great
help
to
me
in
my
business
i
became
more
friendly
more
honest
more
loving
to
my
and
i
also
acquired
better
judgment
and
was
able
to
do
the
right
thing
at
the
right
time
as
a
natural
result
my
business
improved
before
i
knew
anything
of
christian
science
my
business
had
often
been
a
burden
to
me
fear
and
worry
deprived
me
of
my
rest
how
different
it
is
now
through
the
study
of
the
bible
which
now
possesses
unmeasurable
treasures
for
me
and
for
our
textbook
science
and
health
and
the
other
works
of
our
leader
i
receive
peace
and
confidence
in
god
and
that
insight
into

which
is
necessary

the
correct

for
a
long
time

have
been
impelled
to
contribute
a
testimony
of
the
healing

of

as
i
read
other
testimonies
and
rejoice
in
them
some
one
may
rejoice
in

i

reading

by
applying
it
i
found
it
to
be
the
truth
that
jesus
taught
the
truth
that
sets
free

in

must
follow

i
also
had
severe
stomach
trouble
of
over
eight
years
standing
during
which
time
i
always
retired
without
supper
as
the
fear
of
suffering
from
my
food
was
so
great
that
i
denied
myself
food
when
hungry
for
over
twenty
years
i
had
ovarian
trouble
which
was
almost
unbearable
at
times
it
dated
from
the
birth
of
my
first
child
and
at
one
time
necessitated
an
operation
i
suffered
with
about
all
the
ills
that
flesh
is

had
trouble
with
my
eyes
from

i
would

refused
to
do

reached

has
done
for

it
has
been
my
privilege
to
have
interviews
with
representatives
of
more
than
sixty
per
cent
of
the
nations
of
this
earth
under
their
own
vine
and
i
had
never
heard
a
principle
understandingly
advanced
that
would
enable
mankind
to
obey
the
apostolic
command
prove
all
things
until
science
and
health
with
key
to
the
scriptures
was
placed
in
my
hands
i
believe
that
the
honest
study
of
this
book
in
connection
with
the
bible
will
enable
one
to
prove
all
things
i
make
this
unqualified
statement
because
of
what
my
eyes
have
seen
and
my
ears
heard
from
my
of
unquestioned
integrity
and
the
positive
proofs
i
have
gained
by
the
study
of
these
books
many
supposed
material
laws
that
had
been
rooted
and
grounded
in
my
mentality
from
youth
have
been
overcome
it
required
some
time
for
me
to
wake
up
to
our

words
in
miscellaneous
writings
the
advancing
stages
of
christian
science
are
gained
through
growth
not
accretion
i
had
many
disappointments
and
falls
before
i
was
willing
to
do
the
scientific
work
required
to
prove
this
statement
yet
notwithstanding
the
cost
to
ourselves
i
am
convinced
that
we
can
not
do
much
credit
to
the
cause
we
profess
to
love
until
we
place
ourselves
in
a
position
to
prove
god
as
he
really
is
to
us
individually
and
our
relation
to
him
by
scientific
work
i
wish
to
express
loving
gratitude
to
our
leader
for
the
new
edition
of
science

health
in
studying
this
new
edition
one
can
not
help
seeing
the
wisdom
love
and
careful
and
prayerful
thought
expressed
in
the
revision
often
the
changing
of
a

word
in

not

ills
healed
when
i
took
up
the
study
of
christian
science
nearly
three
years
ago
i
was
suffering
from
a
very
bad
rupture
of
years
standing
sometimes
the
pain
was
so
severe
that
it
seemed
as
if
i
could
not
endure
it
these
spells
would
last
four
or
five
hours
and
while
everything
was
done
for
me
that
could
be
done
no
permanent
relief
came
to
me
until
i
commenced
reading
science
and
health
with
key
to
the
scriptures
after
i
had
once
looked
into
it
i
wanted
to
read
all
the
time
i
was
so
absorbed
in
the
study
of
the
little
book
that
i
hardly
realized
when
the
healing
came
but
i
was
healed
not
only
of
the
rupture
but
also
of
other
troubles
inflammatory
rheumatism
catarrh
corns
and
bunions
i
would
never
part
with
the
book
if
i
could
not
get
another

am
years
old
and
am
enjoying
very
good
health

mother
and
daughter
healed
when
christian
science
came
to
me
i
had
been
taking
medicine
every
day
for
twenty
years
on
account
of
constipation
i
had
been
treated
by
doctors
and
specialists
had
taken
magnetic
treatments
and
osteopathy
had
tried
change
of
climate
had
an
operation
in
a
hospital
and
when
i
came
out
was
worse
than
before
i
was
so
discouraged
after
i
had
tried
everything
i
ever
heard
of
and
was
no
better
but
rather
grew
worse
that
it
seemed
as
though
i
must
give
up
trying
to
get
well
when
a
friend
suggested
that
i
try
christian
science
i
had
heard
that
christian
scientists
healed
by
prayer
and
i
thought
this
must
be
the
way
jesus
had
healed
i
felt
that
this
was
all
there
was
left
for
me
to
try
i
sent
for
the
book
science
and
health
and
commenced
to
read
it
out
of
curiosity
not
thinking
or
knowing
that
i
could
be
helped
by
the
reading
but
thinking
i
must
still
take
medicine
and
that
i
must
also
have
treatment
by
a
scientist
i
however
dropped
my
medicine
and
read
for
three
days
then
a
light
began
to
shine
in
the
darkness
i
was
healed
of
the
trouble
and
have
never
had
to
take
medicine
since
i
have
studied
science
and
health
faithfully
ever
since
and
other
ailments
have
disappeared
my
little
daughter
has
also
been
healed
and
has
learned
to
use
this
knowledge
in
her
school
work
leadville
liver
complaint
healed
as
my
thoughts
go
back
to
the
time
when
i
believed
i
had
nothing
to
live
for
and
when
each
morning
awaking
from
sleep
brought
a
sense
of
disappointment
to
find
myself
still
among
the
living
for
i
had
hoped
each
night
that
i
closed
my
eyes
in
sleep
that
it
would
be
the
last
time
my
heart
overflows
with
love
and
gratitude
to
god
for
our
dear
leader
who
discovered
this
blessed
truth
and
to
the
dear
ones
who
have
helped
me
so
lovingly
and
patiently
over
many
rough
places
twelve
years
ago
i
consulted
a
physician
because
i
had
noticed
some
spots
on
one
of
my
arms
he
said
they
were
liver
spots
but
that
it
was
not
worth
while
prescribing
for
those
few
that
i
should
wait
until
i
was
covered
with
them
about
three
months
later
with
the
exception
of
my
face
and
hands
i
was
covered
with
them
then
i
became
alarmed
and
called
on
another
physician
who
prescribed
for
me
but
be
finally
said
he
could
do
no
more
for
me
other
physicians
were
consulted
with
no
better
results
six
years
ago
friends
advised
me
to
see
their
family
physician
and
when
i
called
on
him
he
said
he
was
positive
he
could
cure
me
so
i
asked
him
to
prescribe
for
me
at
the
end
of
two
years
after
prescribing
steadily
he
said
i
was
so
full
of
medicine
that
he
was
afraid
to
have
me
take
any
more
and
advised
a
rest
after
having
paid
out
a
small
fortune
i
was
no
better
and
very
much
discouraged
two
years
ago
having
failed
in
business
i
applied
to
one
of
my
patrons
for
a
furnished
room
where
i
could
meet
the
few
i
still
had
left
this
lady
who
is
a
christian
scientist
loaned
me
science
and
health
and
because
she
asked
me
so
often
how
i
was
getting
on
with
the
book
i
began
reading
it
i
also
attended
the
wednesday
evening
meetings
which
i
found
very
interesting
after
hearing
the
testimonies
at
the
meetings
i
decided
to
speak
to
some
practitioner
about
these
spots
but
not
until
i
had
at
least
a
hundred
dollars
on
hand
because
i
thought
i
would
require
that
amount
for
treatments
as
i
had
been
accustomed
to
paying
high
prices
i
had
not
inquired
about
prices
and
in
fact
did
not
speak
to
any
one
about
my
intentions
because
i
felt
sensitive
on
this
subject
when
i
had
read
about
half
of
science
and
health
i
missed
the
spots
and
upon
searching
could
find
no
trace
of
them
they
had
entirely
disappeared
without
treatment
in
a
few
weeks
the
reading
of
that
book
had
accomplished
what
had
failed
to
accomplish
in
ten
years
it
is
impossible
to
express
the
feeling
of
relief
and
happiness
which
came
over
me
then
astoria
y
a
convincing
investigation
while
i
have
testified
to
those
around
me
and
in
many
localities
of
my
healing
in
christian
science
i
feel
that
it
is
high
time
i
put
the
candle
in
the
candlestick
where
all
who
will
may
see
my
earliest
recollection
was
a
day
of
suffering
a
physical
inheritance
from
my
mother
which
gave
simple
interest
for
a
time
until
years
advanced
and
compound
interest
was
added
my
father
was
a
physician
and
material
remedies
were
used
for
my
mother
without
avail
consequently
his
confidence
in
them
for
me
was
shaken
in
fact
he
often
told
me
it
was
better
to
suffer
without
medicine
than
become
a
chronic
doser
without
pain
i
began
teaching
in
early
life
and
continued
for
more
than
twenty
years
and
during
that
time
not
a
day
passed
without
pain
or
fear
of
pain
and
only
for
my
innate
love
of
life
it
would
have
become
an
intolerable
burden
for
five
years
oatmeal
was
my
chief
food
and
i
became
almost
as
attached
to
it
as
kaspar
hauser
to
his
crust
i
was
early
taught
to
have
faith
in
god
and
many
times
was
relieved
of
pain
only
to
have
it
appear
again
in
an
aggravated
form
at
last
my
heart
cried
out
for
the
living
god
and
the
answer
came
by
one
of
his
messengers
who
told
me
of
christian
science
i
replied
that
i
believed
god
could
heal
but
that
i
had
no
faith
in
the
healing
of
christian
science
but
would
like
to
investigate
its
theology
as
it
might
aid
in
giving
me
some
clue
to
the
meaning
of
life
for
three
years
i
had
searched
the
works
of
the
most
scientific
writers
to
find
the
origin
of
life
many
times
i
would
think
i
had
traced
it
to
the
beginning
but
it
would
elude
my
grasp
every
time
one
day
in
talking
with
my
friend
she
said
she
would
like
to
loan
me
the
textbook
science
and
health
which
i
very
willingly
accepted
not
long
afterward
i
felt
a
severe
attack
of
suffering
i
opened
the
book
for
the
first
time
and
found
a
paragraph
near
the
middle
which
attracted
my
attention
i
read
the
same
paragraph
over
and
over
for
nearly
two
hours
when
the
tea
bell
rang
i
closed
the
book
and
i
shall
never
forget
my
perception
of
the
new
heaven
and
the
new
earth
everything
in
nature
that
i
could
see
seemed
to
have
been
washed
and
made
clean
the
flowers
that
i
have
always
loved
so
much
and
that
from
childhood
had
told
me
such
sweet
stories
now
spoke
to
me
of
the
the
hearts
of
my
friends
seemed
kinder
i
had
touched
the
hem
of
the
garment
of
healing
i
ate
my
supper
that
evening
forgetful
of
the
preparations
i
had
made
for
suffering
and
when
the
next
day
began
i
was
more
zealous
of
good
work
than
ever
before
since
closing
science
and
health
at
my
first
reading
i
have
never
been
able
to
find
the
paragraph
which
i
had
read
so
many
times
over
the
words
seemed
to
have
slipped
away
from
me
but
my
joy
knew
no
bounds
at
having
found
the
pearl
of
great
price
by
the
continued
reading
of
the
book
i
was
entirely
healed
and
for
fourteen
years
i
have
not
seen
a
day
of
physical
suffering
miss
rome
deafness
and
dropsy
healed
i
had
been
deaf
from
childhood
i
suffered
intensely
after
eating
and
dropsy
was
another
of
my
complaints
this
with
consumption
caused
one
doctor
to
say
it
puzzles
me
i
have
never
seen
such
a
case
before
as
yours
i
met
a
friend
who
had
been
cured
in
christian
science
and
she
said
try
christian
science
i
got
a
copy
of
science
and
health
and
in
three
weeks
i
was
entirely
cured
i
felt
uplifted
it
seemed
as
if
god
arms
were
around
and
about
me
i
felt
as
if
heaven
had
come
down
to
earth
for
me
after
five
years
of
suffering
can
any
one
wonder
at
my
unspeakable
gratitude
a
pittsburg
pa
grateful
for
many
blessings
in
i
began
the
study
of
christian
science
at
that
time
i
was
greatly
in
need
of
its
healing
truth
for
a
number
of
years
previous
i
had
been
a
with
no
hope
of
ever
being
well
and
strong
again
several
years
before
this
time
i
had
undergone
an
operation
which
resulted
in
peritonitis
for
three
years
previous
to
my
study
of
science
and
health
by
eddy
i
was
scarcely
ever
free
from
headache
caused
by
the
weakened
and
diseased
condition
of
the
internal
organs
at
the
time
i
began
the
study
of
christian
science
i
was
taking
five
kinds
of
medicine
i
began
to
read
science
and
health
and
did
not
take
treatment
for
i
thought
if
this
is
truth
i
shall
be
healed
if
it
is
not
i
shall
be
able
to
detect
it
and
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
i
became
a
devoted
student
and
gradually
my
bodily
diseases
left
me
i
was
free
and
since
that
time
nearly
ten
years
ago
neither
my
two
children
nor
myself
have
taken
any
medicine
and
our
understanding
of
truth
has
been
able
to
meet
and
overcome
any
suggestion
of
illness
i
was
a
devoted
member
of
an
orthodox
church
but
as
i
grew
older
i
began
to
question
my
beliefs
and
to
my
questions
i
could
find
no
satisfactory
answer
i
became
dissatisfied
and
finally
ceased
attending
church
i
could
not
accept
the
idea
of
god
taught
there
and
at
last
my
friends
looked
sadly
upon
me
as
an
atheist
there
i
stood
until
i
learned
to
know
god
as
revealed
in
science
and
health
and
then
all
my
questionings
were
answered
in
my
girlhood
i
had
always
prayed
to
the
god
i
held
in
mind
and
when
the
shadows
of
sickness
pain
and
death
came
to
my
family
i
prayed
as
only
those
can
who
know
that
if
he
helps
not
there
is
none
but
my
prayers
were
unanswered
then
i
closed
my
bible
saying
there
is
a
mistake
somewhere
perhaps
some
time
i
may
know
only
those
who
know
the
attitude
of
mind
that
i
was
in
can
understand
the
joy
that
came
to
me
as
i
began
to
learn
of
god
in
christian
science
and
of
my
relation
to
him
many
proofs
of
the
healing
power
of
truth
and
of
his
protecting
care
throng
my
thoughts
seven
years
ago
when
we
were
in
a
far
distant
country
where
christian
science
was
then
unknown
my
little
daughter
came
in
one
morning
from
her
school
saying
mother
i
have
measles
twenty
of
the
girls
are
sick
in
bed
and
i
am
afraid
they
will
put
me
there
also
her
face
hands
and
chest
were
covered
with
a
deep
red
rash
throat
sore
and
eyes
inflamed
we
began
immediately
to
do
our
work
in
science
and
at
night
when
i
left
her
at
the
door
of
the
college
her
face
was
clear
her
eyes
bright
and
all
fear
destroyed
that
was
the
end
of
the
disease
boston
mass
a
joyful
experience
in
love
and
gratitude
to
god
and
to
eddy
the
interpreter
of
jesus
beautiful
teachings
i
wish
to
tell
of
some
of
the
benefits
which
i
have
received
from
christian
science
it
is
a
little
over
a
year
since
science
found
me
in
a
deplorable
condition
physically
as
well
as
mentally
i
had
ailments
of
many
years
standing
chronic
stomach
trouble
severe
eye
trouble
made
almost
unbearable
from
the
constant
fear
of
losing
any
sight
a
fate
which
had
befallen
my
mother
also
a
painful
rupture
of
years
standing
these
ailments
combined
with
unhappy
conditions
in
my
home
made
me
very
despondent
i
had
entirely
lost
my
belief
in
an
god
and
i
did
not
know
where
to
turn
for
help
at
that
time
christian
science
was
brought
to
my
notice
and
i
shall
never
forget
the
sublime
moment
when
i
perceived
that
an
father
is
always
with
me
forgotten
was
all
sorrow
and
worry
and
after
four
weeks
reading
in
science
and
health
all
my
ailments
had
disappeared
i
am
today
a
healthy
contented
woman
all
this
has
come
to
pass
in
one
short
year
and
my
earnest
desire
is
to
be
more
and
more
worthy
to
be
called
a
child
of
god
this
is
in
loving
gratitude
for
an
understanding
of
this
glorious
truth
chicago
an
help
it
is
a
year
since
i
began
to
read
science
and
health
and
i
will
now
try
to
outline
what
a
knowledge
of
its
teachings
has
done
for
me
my
condition
was
then
very
trying
my
eyes
which
had
caused
me
much
trouble
since
childhood
were
very
painful
for
these
i
had
been
treated
by
some
of
the
best
specialists
in
my
native
land
and
after
coming
to
the
united
states
i
had
been
doctored
much
and
had
worn
glasses
for
four
years
i
also
had
catarrh
for
which
i
had
taken
much
medicine
without
being
relieved
in
addition
to
this
i
was
an
excessive
smoker
using
tobacco
in
some
form
almost
constantly
i
had
contracted
a
heart
and
used
liquors
freely
the
one
who
brought
to
me
that
which
i
now
prize
so
highly
was
a
book
agent
i
told
him
that
i
should
be
forced
to
leave
my
trade
on
account
of
my
eyes
he
then
told
me
of
having
been
healed
of
a
cancer
through
christian
science
treatment
he
showed
me
a
copy
of
science
and
health
which
had
the
signs
of
much
use
and
after
being
assured
that
if
i
did
my
part
i
would
be
healed
of
all
my
diseases
i
sent
for
a
copy
of
the
book
my
recovery
was
very
rapid
for
after
reading
the
book
only
three
weeks
i
was
completely
healed
of
the
tobacco
habit
i
will
say
in
regard
to
this
healing
that
it
did
not
require
even
as
much
as
a
resolution
on
my
part
i
was
smoking
a
cigar
while
reading
science
and
health
when
all
the
desire
to
continue
smoking
left
me
and
i
have
never
had
a
desire
to
use
tobacco
in
any
form
since
then
my
eyes
were
the
next
to
manifest
the
influence
of
the
new
knowledge
gained
and
had
soon
so
far
recovered
that
i
could
go
about
my
work
with
ease
and
i
have
had
no
more
use
for
glasses
my
heart
is
normal
the
catarrh
has
totally
disappeared
and
i
am
not
addicted
to
the
use
of
liquor
christian
science
has
proved
to
be
an
help
not
only
in
overcoming
physical
ailments
but
in
business
and
daily
life
it
has
also
overcome
a
great
sense
of
fear
the
bible
which
i
regarded
with
suspicion
has
become
my
guide
and
christianity
has
become
a
sweet
reality
because
the
christian
science
textbook
has
indeed
been
a
key
to
the
scriptures
and
has
breathed
through
the
gospel
pages
a
sweet
sense
of
harmony
sioux

iowa
severe

trouble
overcome
after
hearing
christian
science
lightly
spoken
of
from
a
christian
pulpit
i
decided
to
go
to
one
of
the
services
and
hear
for
myself
from
infancy
i
had
been
devoted
to
my
church
and
as
soon
as
i
was
old
enough
i
was
ever
active
in
the
work
feeling
it
to
be
my
duty
to
attend
every
service
held
in
my
own
church
i
took
advantage
of
the
wednesday
evening
meetings
my
first
visit
was
not
my
last
i
am
thankful
to
say
for
i
saw
immediately
that
these
people
not
only
preached
christianity
but
practised
and
lived
it
at
that
time
i
was
wearing
glasses
and
had
worn
them
for
sixteen
years
at
times
i
suffered
the
most
intense
pain
and
for
this
phase
of
the
trouble
one
specialist
after
another
had
been
consulted
all
gave
me
very
much
the
same
advice
each
one
urged
extreme
carefulness
and
gave
me
glasses
that
seemed
to
relieve
for
a
time
none
of
them
held
out
any
hope
that
my
sight
would
ever
be
restored
saying
that
the
defect
had
existed
since
infancy
and
that
in
time
i
should
be
blind
the
thought
of
blindness
was
very
distressing
to
me
but
i
tried
to
bear
it
with
christian
resignation
since
i
thought
that
god
had
seen
fit
to
afflict
me
but
since
i
have
learned
that
he
is
a
loving
father
who
gives
only
good
i
regret
that
i
ever
charged
him
with
my
affliction
i
had
no
treatment
but
i
read
science
and
health
and
my
eyes
were
healed
and
glasses
laid
aside
i
can
never
find
words
to
express
my
thanks
to
our
dear
leader
through
whose
teachings
my
sight
has
been
regained
i
can
truthfully
say
that
whereas
i
was
blind
now
i
see
through
an
understanding
of
truth
i
have
found
my
sight
perfect
as
god
gave
it
miss
wilmington
a
testimony
from
ireland
it
is
with
a
heart
full
of
love
and
gratitude
to
god
and
to
our
dear
leader
that
i
send
this
testimony
to
the
field
i
had
never
been
a
strong
girl
had
always
been
subject
to
colds
and
chills
and
suffered
all
my
life
from
a
delicate
throat
seven
years
ago
i
had
a
very
severe
attack
of
rheumatic
fever
and
subsequently
two
less
severe
ones
these
left
all
sorts
of
evils
behind
them
debility
chronic
constipation
and
several
others
so
that
with
these
ills
my
life
was
often
a
burden
to
me
and
i
used
to
think
i
never
should
receive
relief
or
health
i
had
also
lost
all
love
for
god
and
faith
in
him
i
could
not
accept
a
god
who
as
i
then
believed
visited
sickness
and
sorrow
upon
his
children
as
a
means
for
drawing
them
to
him
i
was
in
this
state
of
mind
and
body
when
christian
science
found
me
a
dear
friend
seeing
my
suffering
presented
the
truth
to
me
and
though
at
first
i
did
not
believe
that
there
could
be
healing
for
me
the
christian
scientists
god
seemed
to
be
the
one
i
had
been
looking
for
all
my
life
i
began
to
read
science
and
health
and
shall
never
forget
my
joy
at
finding
that
i
could
love
and
trust
god
i
took
to
studying
the
bible
and
read
nothing
but
science
and
health
and
other
christian
science
literature
for
a
year
after
studying
the
little
book
for
about
six
weeks
i
one
day
realized
that
i
was
a
well
woman
that
i
had
taken
no
medicine
for
three
weeks
and
that
my
body
was
perfectly
harmonious
the
reading
of
science
and
health
had
healed
me
the
wonderful
joy
and
spiritual
uplifting
which
came
to
me
then
no
words
of
mine
can
describe
i
had
also
suffered
from
astigmatism
and
had
for
several
years
been
obliged
to
use
special
glasses
when
reading
or
working
and
could
never
use
my
eyes
for
more
than
half
an
hour
but
from
the
first
reading
of
science
and
health
i
found
that
i
could
read
in
any
light
and
for
any
length
of
time
without
the
slightest
discomfort
i
am
not
only
grateful
for
the
physical
healing
but
for
the
mental
regeneration
i
rejoice
that
i
am
now
able
to
help
others
who
are
sick

the
textbook
makes
operation
unnecessary
in
the
early
part
of
the
year
my
physician
said
i
must
undergo
a
surgical
operation
in
order
ever
to
be
well
while
in
great
fear
and
dreading
the
operation
a
kind
neighbor
called
and
after
telling
me
of
christian
science
gave
me
a
copy
of
science
and
health
she
said
i
must
put
aside
all
medicine
and
by
reading
faithfully
she
knew
i
could
be
healed
the
book
became
my
constant
companion
and
in
a
short
time
i
was
healed
besides
the
relief
from
an
operation
i
was
completely
healed
of
severe
headaches
and
stomach
trouble
physicians
could
give
me
no
help
for
either
of
these
ailments
for
ten
years
i
have
not
used
medicine
of
any
kind
and
have
not
missed
a
christian
science
service
on
account
of
sickness
during
this
period
i
am
perfectly
well
to
say
that
i
am
grateful
to
god
for
all
this
does
not
express
my
feelings
the
physical
healing
was
wonderful
but
the
understanding
given
me
of
god
and
the
ability
to
help
others
outweigh
all
else

kidney
disease
and
eye
trouble
healed
early
in
i
was
teaching
in
a
private
i
was
a
very
unhappy
discontented
woman
i
had
kidney
disease
besides
sore
eyes
and
my
general
health
was
very
bad
the
doctor
said
that
the
climate
did
not
suit
me
and
that
i
certainly
should
have
a
change
the
best
thing
he
said
was
to
go
back
to
france
my
own
country
but
i
did
not
like
to
leave
the
school
so
i
struggled
on
until
july
when
we
went
travelling
for
a
month
but
i
came
home
worse
than
ever
i
had
a
lot
of
worry
one
disappointment
after
another
and
i
often
thought
that
life
was
not
worth
living
in
september
we
heard
for
the
first
time
of
christian
science
through
a
girl
who
was
attending
our
and
who
was
healed
through
christian
science
treatment
we
bought
the
textbook
science
and
health
with
key
to
the
scriptures
by
eddy
and
what
a
revelation
it
was
and
is
to
us
it
is
indeed
the
fountain
of
truth
i
had
read
science
and
health
but
a
very
short
time
when
i
took
off
my
glasses
began
to
sleep
well
and
soon
found
myself
well
in
mind
and
body
besides
this
it
has
brought
harmony
into
our
school
where
there
had
been
discord
and
everything
is
changed
for
the
better
i
can
not
describe
the
happiness
that
has
come
to
me
through
christian
science
i
can
only
exclaim
with
the
psalmist
bless
the
lord
o
my
soul
and
may
god
bless

my
one
aim
now
is
to
live
christian

not
in
words
only
but
in
deeds
loving
god
more
and
my
neighbor
as
myself

disease
of
bowels
healed
when
i
first
heard
of
christian
science
i
had
been
afflicted
for
nine
years
with
a
very
painful
disease
of
the
bowels
which
four
physicians
failed
even
to
diagnose
all
giving
different
causes
for
the
dreadful
sufferings
i
endured
the
last
physician
advised
me
to
take
no
more
medicine
for
these
attacks
as
drugs
would
not
reach
the
cause
or
do
any
good
about
this
time
i
heard
of
christian
science
and
had
the
opportunity
of
reading
science
and
health
with
key
to
the
scriptures
by
eddy
a
few
minutes
every
day
for
about
a
week
and
i
was
thereby
healed
in
looking
back
i
found
i
had
not
suffered
in
the
least
from
the
time
i
began
reading
this
book
it
has
been
nearly
seventeen
years
since
this
wonderful
healing
and
i
have
had
no
return
of
the
disease
my
gratitude
is
endless
and
can
be
best
expressed
by
striving
mightily
to
walk
in
the
path

has
so
lovingly
shown

medical
care
for
two
years
but
grew
worse
instead
of
better
i
was
then
taken
to
specialists
who
pronounced
my
case
incurable
saying
i
was
in
the
last
stages
of
kidney
disease
and
could
live
only
a
short
time
shortly
afterward
my
uncle
gave
me
a
copy
of
science
and
health
with
key
to
the
scriptures
and
asked
me
to
study
it
after
studying
a
short
time
i
was
able
to
walk
a
distance
of
several
miles
which
i
had
not
been
able
to
do
for
three
years
i
also
laid
aside
glasses
which
i
had
worn
seven
years
having
been
told
i
would
become
blind
if
my
eyes
did
not
receive
proper
care
it
is
over
a
year
since
i
received
blessing
and
i
am
now
enjoying
perfect
health
and
happiness
i
have
never
had
my
glasses
on
since
i
first
began
reading
science
and
health
and
i
have
not
used
any
medicine
spring
valley
a
testimony
from
scotland
i
came
to
christian
science
purely
for
physical
healing
i
was
very
ill
and
unhappy
very
cynical
and
disbelieving
in
regard
to
what
i
heard
of
god
and
religion
i
tried
to
live
my
life
in
my
own
way
and
put
religion
aside
i
was
a
great
believer
in
fate
and
in
and
thought
to
put
them
in
the
place
of
god
with
the
consequence
that
i
was
led
to
do
many
rash
and
foolish
things
i
am
now
thankful
to
say
that
my
outlook
on
life
is
entirely
changed
i
have
proved
god
wisdom
and
goodness
so
often
that
i
am
willing
and
thankful
to
know
my
future
is
in
his
hands
and
that
all
things
must
work
out
for
the
best
i
have
found
a
god
whom
i
can
love
and
worship
with
my
whole
heart
and
i
now
read
my
bible
with
interest
and
understanding
i
was
healed
of
very
bad
rheumatism
simply
by
reading
science
and
health
i
had
tried
many
medicines
also
massage
with
no
result
and
the
doctors
told
me
that
i
would
always
suffer
from
this
disease
as
it
was
inherited
and
also
because
i
had
rheumatic
fever
when
a
child
i
suffered
day
and
night
and
nothing
relieved
me
until
science
proved
to
me
the
falseness
of
this
belief
by
removing
it
i
gave
up
all
the
medicines
i
was
taking
and
have
never
touched
any
since
and
that
is
more
than
two
years
ago
before
this
i
had
often
tried
to
do
without
a
medicine
that
i
had
taken
every
day
for
ten
years
but
was
always
ill
and
had
to
return
to
it
until
i
found
out
that
one
mind
is
the
only
medicine
and
then
i
was
freed
from
the
suffering
i
had
also
suffered
constantly
from
bilious
attacks
colds
and
a
weak
chest
and
had
been
warned
not
to
be
out
in
wet
weather
but
now
i
am
glad
to
say
i
am
quite
free
from
all
those
material
laws
and
go
out
in
all
sorts
of
weather
edinburgh
scotland
curing
better
than
enduring
for
eight
years
i
was
a
great
sufferer
from
weak
lungs
and
after
being
treated
by
ten
different
physicians
in
the
states
of
illinois
missouri
and
colorado
i
was
told
there
was
no
hope
of
my
recovery
from
what
they
pronounced
tuberculosis
which
was
hereditary
my
father
having
been
afflicted
with
it
i
was
greatly
emaciated
and
hardly
able
to
be
about
my
general
condition
was
aggravated
by
what
the
doctors
said
was
paralysis
of
the
bowels
three
physicians
so
diagnosed
it
at
different
times
and
assured
my
husband
that
i
could
never
get
more
than
temporary
relief
this
indeed
i
found
difficult
to
obtain
in
spite
of
my
almost
frantic
efforts
at
times
i
was
nearly
insane
from
suffering
and
after
eight
years
of
doctoring
i
found
myself
steadily
growing
worse
for
four
years
i
did
not
have
a
normal
action
of
the
bowels
and
it
was
only
by
extreme
effort
and
by
resort
to
powerful
drugs
or
mechanical
means
with
resultant
suffering
that
any
action
whatever
could
be
brought
about
i
had
heard
nothing
of
the
curative
power
of
christian
science
and
only
to
oblige
a
friend
i
went
one
night
about
three
years
ago
to
one
of
their
testimonial
meetings
in
boulder
colorado
i
was
much
impressed
by
what
i
heard
there
and
determined
at
once
to
investigate
this
strange
religion
in
the
hope
that
it
might
have
something
good
for
me
i
bought
the
textbook
science
and
health
and
from
the
first
i
found
myself
growing
stronger
and
better
both
physically
and
mentally
as
i
acquired
a
better
understanding
and
endeavored
to
put
into
practice
what
i
learned
in
one
week
i
was
able
to
get
along
better
without
drugs
than
i
had
for
years
with
them
and
before
three
months
had
passed
i
was
better
than
i
had
been
any
time
in
my
life
for
i
had
always
suffered
more
or
less
from
bowel
trouble
since
that
time
i
have
taken
no
medicine
whatever
and
rely
wholly
upon
christian
science
my
lungs
are
now
sound
my
bowels

active
my
general
health
excellent
and
i
am
able
to
endure
without
fatigue
tasks
that
before
would
have
prostrated
me
the
study
of
our
textbook
was
the
sole
means
of
my

panama
severe
eczema

it
is
only
two
years
since
i
came
from
darkness
into
the
light
of
christian
science
and
to
me
the
spiritual
uplifting
has
been
wonderful
to
say
nothing
of
the
physical
healing
words
can
not
express
my
gratitude
for
benefits
i
have
received
in
that
time
for
five
years
i
suffered
with
that
dreaded
disease
eczema
all
over
my
body
five
doctors
said
there
was
no
help
for
me
the
suffering
seemed
as
terrible
as
the
hell
fire
that
i
had
been
taught
to
believe
in
when
christian
science
came
to
me
two
years
ago
through
a
dear
friend
she
gave
me
a
copy
of
science
and
health
and
asked
me
to
read
it
i
told
her
that
i
would
for
i
was
like
a
drowning
man
grasping
at
a
straw
i
had
been
a
bible
student
for
years
but
when
i
commenced
reading
science
and
health
with
the
bible
i
was
healed
in
less
than
a
week
i
never
had
a
treatment
a
case
of
measles
was
also
destroyed
in
hours
after
it
appeared
vermilion
ohio
science
and

a
priceless
boon
i
am
a
willing
witness
to
the
healing
power
of
christian
science
having
had
a
lifetime
battle
with
disease
and
medical
experiments
various
doctors
finally
admitted
that
they
had
exhausted
their
resources
and
could
only
offer
me
palliatives
saying
that
a
cure
was
impossible
i
had
paralysis
of
the
bowels
frequent
sick
headaches
with
unutterable
agony
and
my
mortal
career
was
nearly
brought
to
an
end
by
a
malignant
type
of
yellow
fever
many
were
the
attending
evils
of
this
physical
inharmony
but
god
confounds
the
wisdom
of
men
for
while
studying
science
and
health
two
years
ago
the
veil
of
ignorance
was
lifted
and
perfect
health
was
shown
to
me
to
be
my
real
condition
and
to
such
there
is
no
relapse
the
constant
use
of
glasses
which
were
apparently
a
necessity
to
me
for
years
was
proven
needless
and
they
were
laid
aside
eddy

a
well
of
comfort
to
me
by

interpretation
the
way
of
the
lord
is
made
straight
to
me
and
mine
it
aids
us
in
our
daily
overcoming
of
the
tyranny
of
the
flesh
and
its
rebellion
against
the
blessed
leading
of
christ
truth
the
daily
study
of
the
bible
and
our
textbook
is
bringing
more
and
more
into
our
consciousness
the
power
of
god
unto
salvation
manatee
a
critic
convinced
with
gratitude
to
god
i
acknowledge
my
lifelong
debt
to
christian
science
in
i
attended
my
first
christian
science
meeting
and
was
deeply
impressed
with
the
earnestness
of
the
people
and
the
love
reflected
but
as
for
the
spiritual
healing
of
the
physical
body
i
did
not
believe
such
a
thing
to
be
possible
i
bought
science
and
health
and
studied
it
to
be
able
to
dispute
intelligently
with
the
supposedly
deluded
followers
of
christian
science
i
pursued
the
study
carefully
and
thoroughly
and
i
have
had
abundant
reason
since
to
be
glad
that
i
did
for
through
this
study
and
the
resultant
understanding
of
my
relation
to
god
i
was
healed
of
a
disease
with
which
i
had
been
afflicted
since
childhood
and
for
which
there
was
no
known
remedy
surely
my
experience
has
been
the
fulfilling
in
part
of
the
scripture
he
sent
his
word
and
healed
them
and
delivered
them
from
their
destructions
i
believe
that
science
and
health
reveals
the
word
referred
to
by
david
a
b
kansas
city
mo
born
again
it
was
in
april
that
i
first
heard
the
still
small
voice
of
the
christ
and
received
healing
through
christian
science
and
the
blessings
have
been
so
many
since
that
it
would
take
too
much
space
to
name
them
reared
from
childhood
in
an
intellectual
atmosphere
my
paternal
grandfather
having
been
an
orthodox
minister
of
the
old
school
for
forty
years
and
my
father
a
deep
student
ever
seeking
for
the
truth
of
all
things
i
began
early
to
ponder
and
to
study
into
the
meaning
of
life
and
came
to
the
conclusion
before
i
was
twenty
that
though
god
probably
existed
in
some
remote
place
still
it
was
impossible
to
connect
him
with
my
present
living
my
highest
creed
therefore
became
do
right
because
it
right
and
not
for
fear
of
being
punished
then
began
the
suffering
sorrow
after
sorrow
followed
each
other
in
rapid
succession
for
ten
long
years
there
was
no
rest
the
road
was
indeed
long
and
hard
and
had
no
turning
until
finally
the
one
thing
that
had
stood
by
me
all
through
the
trials
namely
my
health
gave
way
and
with
that
went
my
last
hope
but
the
last
hour
of
the
night
had
come
the
dawn
of
day
was
at
hand
a
dear
friend
left
science
and
health
upon
my
piano
one
day
saying
that
i
would
gain
much
good
by
reading
it
glad
to
get
away
from
my
own
poor
thoughts
i
opened
the
little
book
and
began
to
read
i
had
read
only
a
short
time
when
such
a
wonderful
transformation
took
place
i
was
renewed
born
again
mere
words
can
not
tell
the
story
of
the
mighty
that
carried
me
to
the
very
gates
of
heaven
when
i
began
to
read
the
book
life
was
a
burden
but
before
i
had
finished
reading
it
the
first
time
i
was
doing
all
my
housework
and
doing
it
easily
and
since
that
glorious
day
i
have
been
a
well
woman
my
health
is
splendid
and
i
am
striving
to
let
my
light
so
shine
that
others
may
be
led
to
the
truth
there
have
been
some
mighty
struggles
with
error
and
i
have
learned
that
we
can
not
reach
heaven
with
one
long
stride
or
easily
drift
inside
the
gate
but
that
the
asking
and
the
seeking
and
the
knocking
must
be
earnest
and
persistent
for
a
long
time
i
was
always
looking
back
to
see
if
the
error
had
gone
until
one
day
when
i
realized
that
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
what
spiritual
sense
means
i
must
put
corporeal
sense
behind
me
i
then
set
to
work
in
earnest
to
find
the
true
way
i
opened
science
and
health
and
these
words
were
before
me
if
god
were
understood
instead
of
being
merely
believed
this
understanding
would
establish
health
i
saw
that
i
must
get
the
right
understanding
of
god
i
closed
the
book
and
with
head
bowed
in
prayer
i
waited
with
longing
intensity
for
some
answer
how
long
i
waited
i
do
not
know
but
suddenly
like
a
wonderful
burst
of
sunlight
after
a
storm
came
clearly
this
thought
be
still
and
know
that
i
am
god
i
held
my
breath
deep
into
my
hungering
thought
sank
the
infinite
meaning
of
that
i
all
egotism
selfishness
everything
that
constitutes
the
mortal
i
sank
abashed
out
of
sight
i
trod
as
it
were
on
holy
ground
words
are
inadequate
to
convey
the
fullness
of
that
spiritual
uplifting
but
others
who
have
had
similar
experiences
will
understand
from
that
hour
i
have
had
an
intelligent
consciousness
of
the
of
an
infinite
god
who
is
only
good
hudson
mass
a
restless
sense
of
existence
destroyed
through
reading
science
and
health
and
the
illumination
which
followed
i
was
healed
of
ulceration
of
the
stomach
and
kindred
troubles
a
restless
sense
of
existence
agnosticism
etc
the
torture
i
endured
with
the
stomach
trouble
i
will
not
attempt
to
describe
the
attending
physician
declared
that
i
could
live
but
a
short
time
and
i
felt
there
would
be
a
limit
to
my
endurance
of
the
torture
but
the
disease
was
dissipated
into
nothingness
through
christian
science
which
brought
me
peace
like
many
others
i
had
been
seemingly
lost
in
the
sea
of
error
without
a
compass
yet
earnestly
and
honestly
seeking
a
haven
i
had
investigated
all
kinds
of
religions
and
philosophies
that
came
under
my
notice
with
the
exception
of
christian
science
which
was
not
then
deemed
worthy
of
inquiry
and
yet
it
held
the
very
truth
i
was
searching
for
the
light
which
shineth
in
the
darkness
and
the
darkness
comprehended
it
not
three
years
of
stubborn
resistance
to
truth
with
increasing
suffering
followed
then
the
light
came
and
with
it
a
new
experience
now
after
nine
years
of
christian
science
experience
under
severe
tests
it
can
be
truthfully
said
that
it
has
not
failed
me
in
any
hour
of
need
cincinnati
ohio
morally
and
physically
healed
i
did
not
accept
christian
science
on
account
of
any
healing
of
my
own
but
after
seeing
my
mother
who
was
fast
drifting
toward
helplessness
with
rheumatism
restored
to
perfect
health
with
only
a
few
treatments
in
christian
science
i
thought
surely
this
must
be
the
truth
as
jesus
taught
and
practised
it
and
if
so
it
was
what
i
had
been
longing
for
this
was
about
ten
years
ago
and
was
the
first
i
had
ever
heard
of
christian
science
we
soon
got
a
copy
of
science
and
health
and
i
began
in
the
right
way
to
see
if
christian
science
were
the
truth
i
had
no
thought
of
studying
it
for
bodily
healing
in
fact
i
did
not
think
i
needed
it
for
that
but
my
soul
cried
out
for
something
i
had
not
yet
found
this
book
was
indeed
a
key
to
the
scriptures
it
was
not
long
after
i
began
reading
before
i
discovered
that
my
eyes
were
good
and
strong
i
could
read
as
much
as
i
wished
and
at
any
time
which
was
something
i
could
not
do
before
as
my
eyes
had
always
been
weak
the
doctors
said
they
never
would
be
very
strong
and
that
if
i
did
not
wear
glasses
i
might
lose
my
sight
altogether
i
never
gave
up
to
wearing
glasses
and
now
thanks
to
christian
science
i
do
not
need
them
my
work
for
the
past
two
years
as
a
railway
mail
clerk
being
a
good
test
at
the
same
time
my
eyes
were
healed
i
also
noticed
that
i
was
entirely
healed
of
another
ailment
which
had
been
with
me
all
my
life
and
which
was
believed
to
be
inherited
since
that
time
my
growth
has
seemed
to
me
slow
yet
when
i
look
back
and
view
myself
as
i
was
before
christian
science
found
me
and
compare
it
with
my
life
as
it
now
is
i
can
only
close
my
eyes
to
the
picture
and
rejoice
that
i
have
been
born
again
and
that
i
have
daily
been
putting
off
the
old
man
with
his
deeds
and
putting
on
the
new
man
some
of
the
many
things
that
have
been
overcome
through
the
study
of
science
and
health
and
through
realizing
and
practising
the
truth
it
teaches
are
profanity
the
use
of
tobacco
a
very
quick
temper
which
made
both
myself
and
those
around
me
at
times
very
miserable

such
thoughts
as
malice
revenge

spent
in
the
hands
of
physicians
from
birth
i
was
considered
a
very
weakly
child
but
my
mother
was
brave
and
being
much
devoted
to
me
did
everything
within
her
knowledge
and
power
for
my
comfort
sickness
and
medicine
were
continually
before
me
and
by
the
time
i
reached
my
teens
i
thought
i
knew
a
material
remedy
for
every
ill
i
continued
in
my
delusion
because
i
was
never
told
the
real
cause
of
my
trouble
besides
being
under
a
leading
specialist
for
two
years
i
was
also
an
outdoor
patient
at
a
noted
hospital
but
i
was
not
healed
it
is
wonderful
how
the
little
ones
are
cared
for
in
the
face
of
all
these
seeming
difficulties
i
always
used
the
prayers
that
i
had
been
taught
and
as
i
grew
older
i
began
to
ask
for
wisdom
little
by
little
i
gained
a
desire
for
freedom
and
my
prayers
finally
led
me
to
the
truth
the
first
week
that
i
heard
of
christian
science
i
visited
the
home
of
dear
christian
science
friends
and
was
at
once
refreshed
by
their
purity
of
thought
and
example
i
bought
a
copy
of
science
and
health
and
after
studying
it
a
little
while
with
the
bible
i
saw
that
if
the
bible
was
true
science
and
health
must
also
be
true
i
began
to
demonstrate
over
my
physical
and
mental
condition
and
as
soon
as
the
fear
and
pain
began
to
leave
me
i
felt
encouraged
to
go
on
i
was
healed
and
stopped
complaining
i
kept
on
studying
our
textbook
and
when
i
got
an
understanding
in
a
small
degree
of
the
science
of
mind
my
first
thought
was
to
help
others
i
was
guided
where
i
could
gress
in
science
and
was
no
longer
carried
about
with
every
wind
of
doctrine
but
held
to
principle
as
closely
as
possible
from
the
time
the
healing
came
into
my
consciousness
the
desire
for
material
remedies
left
me
because
christian
science
at
once
pointed
out
the
way
to
get
at
the
cause
of
discord
and
disease
all
that
i
had
to
give
up
were
the
false
beliefs
of
mortal
mind
christian
science
then
taught
me
to
love
the
church
and
to
appreciate
what
it
had
already
done
for
mankind
i
often
thought
of
the
old
adage
charity
begins
at
home
and
after
three
years
preparation
i
felt
able
to
take
christian
science
to
my
home
where
it
found
in
due
time
ready
acceptance
and
willing
disciples
this
gave
me
even
greater
joy
than
my
own
healing
the
more
good
i
saw
accomplished
the
more
love
i
had
for
the
truth
christian
science
changed
my
course
from
the
first
and
gave
me
a
nobler
aim
and
purpose
in
life
i
was
not
so
easily
influenced
by
other
shortcomings
when
i
learned
that
evil
has
neither
personality
nor
place
i
was
not
so
ready
to
take
offence
when
i
found
out
the
way
to
work
unselfishly
for
the
upbuilding
of
the
cause
toledo
ohio
an
help
found
on
the
of
march
i
received
from
one
of
my
daughters
a
copy
of
science
and
health
on
my
birthday
although
a
constant
reader
of
all
kinds
of
papers
and
books
i
had
never
heard
anything
of
christian
science
except
a
short
notice
that
spring
in
a
san
francisco
newspaper
from
an
orthodox
clergyman
referring
to
the
christian
science
people
in
not
very
complimentary
style
in
eddy
book
i
came
across
a
great
deal
of
thought
that
was
not
readily
understood
at
the
first
reading
but
by
continued
and
careful
study
and
a
good
deal
of
help
from
my
knowledge
of
chemistry
and
natural
philosophy
i
soon
shook
off
the
belief
of
sensation
in
matter
the
elementary
substance
one
afternoon
i
put
the
belt
on
my
circular
saw
to
cut
blocks
of
firewood
and
also
to
split
a
small
stick
of
frame
timber
in
doing
this
the
stick
closed
and
pinched
the
saw
i
picked
up
a
small
wooden
wedge
and
tried
to
drive
it
into
the
saw
kerf
but
a
bit
of
ice
let
the
stick
on
to
the
back
of
the
saw
and
instantly
it
flew
with
heavy
force
into
my
face
and
bouncing
off
my
left
cheek
fell
about
twenty
feet
off
on
the
snow
the
blood
spattered
on
the
snow
next
the
saw
table
and
on
feeling
with
my
hand
there
were
two
wounds
one
on
the
lock
of
the
jaw
and
another
forward
as
big
as
a
dollar
on
the
cheek
bone
now
i
thought
to
myself
there
is
a
case
of
surgery
for
you
and
without
further
ceremony
i
began
to
treat
the
case
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
with
the
result
that
the
bleeding
stopped
almost
instantly
and
so
did
a
thumping
pain
which
had
commenced
i
paid
no
more
attention
to
the
matter
but
finished
my
work
and
then
went
to
supper
when
i
washed
my
face
i
felt
a
big
lump
on
the
jawbone
where
the
block
of
wood
struck
but
after
my
usual
reading
i
went
to
bed
and
slept
all
night
until
near
daylight
when
a
pain
on
the
right
side
awoke
me
on
feeling
with
my
hand
there
was
another
big
lump
on
the
right
side
but
i
treated
it
and
went
to
sleep
again
i
never
lost
an
hour
from
the
hurt
although
i
found
out
that
my
jaw
was
broken
there
is
no
scar
only
a
little
red
spot
on
the
cheek
and
the
lumps
on
the
bone
have
long
since
disappeared
in
summing
up
the
benefits
i
have
received
from
the
reading
of
science
and
health
i
can
but
refer
to
a
condition
of
sickness
dating
back
to
the
war
when
chronic
and
malignant
diarrhea
came
near
making
an
end
of
my
material
existence
my
hearing
also
was
seriously
impaired
from
the
effect
of
cannon
firing
at
shiloh
but
it
has
come
back
to
me
and
where
i
formerly
dared
not
eat
an
orange
or
grapes
i
can
now
eat
anything
without
being
hurt
my
peace
of
mind
is
giving
me
a
rest
which
i
never
experienced
before
during
my
life
and
i
have
ceased
to
look
away
off
for
the
divine
presence
that
was
always
near
though
i
did
not
know
it
baldy
many
physical
and
mental
troubles
overcome
less
than
a
year
ago
when
nothing
but
trouble
seemed
to
encompass
me
i
was
led
to
christian
science
my
mother
copy
of
science
and
health
was
always
lying
on
the
table
but
i
scarcely
ever
read
it
one
day
however
the
mental
conflict
was
so
great
i
commenced
reading
in
the
hope
of
obtaining
peace
every
day
since
then
my
companions
have
been
the
bible
and
science
and
health
at
that
time
i
had
a
very
serious
eruption
on
my
face
which
had
been
there
two
years
we
had
consulted
several
physicians
and
used
every
remedy
suggested
to
eradicate
it
but
they
proved
useless
i
had
given
up
all
hopes
of
its
ever
being
healed
as
the
physician
we
last
consulted
pronounced
it
tuberculosis
of
the
skin
and
incurable
a
few
weeks
after
i
commenced
reading
i
was
amazed
to
see
it
almost
healed
over
and
my
cheek
is
perfectly
smooth
while
the
scar
is
disappearing
in
april
my
baby
was
born
with
only
the
practitioner
and
a
woman
friend
present
i
suffered
little
pain
and
the
third
day
i
went
i
am
able
to
nurse
him
a
privilege
of
which
i
was
deprived
with
my
first
child
he
is
a
picture
of
health
having
never
been
sick
a
day
since
he
was
born
mt
dora
a
new
life
gained
leaving
home
when
a
young
man
i
carried
with
me
a
protection
against
the
temptation
of
a
great
city
a
mother
prayers
and
a
small
bible
for
a
time
i
read
the
bible
and
prayed
but
without
understanding
this
did
not
suffice
and
evil
seemed
to
gain
the
victory
i
soon
omitted
to
read
my
bible
forgot
to
go
to
god
in
prayer
for
guidance
and
help
and
looked
to
the
world
for
that
which
it
never
has
and
never
can
give
health
peace
and
joy
thus
years
later
when
christian
science
came
into
my
home
it
found
me
prayerless
churchless
godless
a
home
discordant
and
with
no
thought
or
knowledge
of
spiritual
things
up
to
this
time
my
wife
had
for
years
been
seeking
health
through
the
physicians
but
without
success
and
as
a
last
resort
had
been
sent
to
christian
science
the
help
received
was
so
wonderful
that
i
commenced
the
study
of
science
and
health
the
first
effect
which
i
realized
from
the
reading
of
our
textbook
was
a
great
love
for
the
bible
and
a
desire
to
read
it
something
which
i
had
not
done
for
years
i
went
in
silent
prayer
to
god
that
i
might
see
the
light
and
truth
which
would
enable
me
to
a
better
man
ye
must
be
born
again
thus
again
and
as
a
child
was
i
taught
to
pray
the
effectual
fervent
prayer
which
availeth
much
in
a
few
weeks
study
of
science
and
health
together
with
the
bible
and
without
other
help
i
was
healed
of
a
desire
for
liquor
of
years
standing
and
of
the
use
of
tobacco
ten
years
have
passed
and
these
appetites
have
never
returned
i
have
never
used
either
liquor
or
tobacco
in
any
form
from
that
time
to
the
present
surely
this
scripture
is
fulfilled
in
our
home
old
things
are
passed
away
behold
all
things
are
become
new
how
can
we
estimate
the
value
of
a
book
the
study
of
which
brings
such
transformation
and
regeneration
only
as
we
endeavor
to
live
and
strive
to
practise
what
it
teaches
can
we
begin
to
pay
our
debt
to
god
and
to
her
whom
he
has
sent
to
make
plain
to
human
understanding
the
life
and
teaching
of
christ
jesus
boston
mass
a
voice
from
england
for
a
number
of
years
i
was
a
weary
woman
not
ill
enough
in
health
to
be
called
an
invalid
but
suffering
more
than
could
be
told
with
fatigue
and
weakness
feeling
that
this
was
god
will
i
did
not
ask
to
be
healed
although
i
was
constantly
doctoring
i
suffered
with
dyspepsia
congestion
of
the
liver
and
many
other
things
including
weak
eyesight
with
all
the
medicine
and
with
different
changes
for
rest
i
never
regained
health
and
thought
i
never
should
so
i
prayed
for
grace
to
bear
my
cross
patiently
for
others
sake
one
day
while
lying
on
my
couch
exhausted
which
had
become
a
frequent
experience
the
words
came
to
me
whatsoever
ye
shall
ask
in
prayer
believing
ye
shall
receive
i
rose
knelt
down
and
said
o
god
make
me
well
i
was
telling
a
friend
this
and
she
kindly
gave
me
a
my
joy
when
i
saw
the
testimonies
of
healing
i
believed
them
remembering
our
lord
words
blessed
are
they
that
have
not
seen
and
yet
have
believed
i
obtained
a
copy
of
science
and
health
and
before
a
week
had
passed
i
realized
that
if
god
was
my
all
i
needed
no
glasses
my
eyes
were
healed
in
a
few
days
and
since
then
i
have
never
thought
of
glasses
i
was
also
cured
of
dyspepsia
and
nothing
that
i
have
eaten
has
hurt
me
since
then
the
belief
in
health
laws
was
next
destroyed
by
knowing
that
our
heavenly
father
did
not
make
them
and
from
this
has
come
the
beautiful
experience
of
the
overcoming
of
fatigue
for
this
alone
i
can
never
be
thankful
enough
true
indeed
are
the
words
they
shall
run
and
not
be
weary
this
was
more
than
a
year
ago
and
i
can
say
that
not
once
have
i
felt
inclined
to
lie
on
the
couch
nor
have
i
had
a
headache
although
i
am
doing
more
work
than
ever
before
fear
has
also
been
overcome
in
many
ways
chelmsford
england
depraved
appetites
overcome
when
christian
science
first
came
to
me
or
rather
when
i
first
came
to
christian
science
i
did
not
have
a
very
bad
opinion
of
myself
i
thought
i
was
a
pretty
good
fellow
i
had
no
religious
views
i
seemed
to
be
getting
along
as
well
as
if
not
better
than
some
who
professed
christianity
so
i
drifted
along
until
i
was
led
to
investigate
christian
science
as
i
progressed
in
the
understanding
as
gained
from
the
study
of
both
science
and
health
and
the
bible
and
commenced
to
know
myself
i
found
that
a
great
change
had
been
wrought
in
me
for
fifteen
years
i
had
used
tobacco
both
chewing
and
smoking
for
ten
years
i
had
been
a
victim
of
the
drink
habit
sometimes
to
excess
i
was
also
addicted
to
profanity
christian
science
removed
these
appetites
a
stomach
trouble
and
other
lesser
ills
such
as
headache
a
bad
temper
an
inordinate
love
of
money
disappeared
under
the
same
benign
influence
those
things
that
seemed
to
be
pleasure
do
not
give
me
pleasure
now
they
were
not
real
pleasure
i
have
lost
nothing
i
have
sacrificed
nothing
but
i
have
gained
everything
and
not
yet
the
whole
for
i
can
see
plenty
yet
to
be
done
the
condition
of
mind
before
investigating
and
after
is
as
different
as
black
and
white
as
eddy
says
not
matter
but
mind
satisfieth
henry
catarrh
of
the
stomach
healed
i
should
like
to
express
my
gratitude
for
the
many
benefits
i
have
received
through
christian
science
and
to
mention
the
great
joy
brought
to
me
in
the
thought
that
man
is
not
the
helpless
victim
of
sin
disease
and
death
through
its
teachings
i
have
been
able
to
overcome
many
errors
when
christian
science
found
me
one
year
ago
last
april
in
chicago
i
was
suffering
from
catarrh
of
the
stomach
which
had
been
very
persistent
and
i
had
been
a
slave
to
the
cigarette
habit
for
eighteen
years
pain
and
weakness
had
robbed
me
of
all
that
one
holds
dear
the
first
symptoms
of
the
disease
appeared
about
five
years
ago
in
the
form
of
severe
cramps
of
the
stomach
which
finally
developed
into
other
symptoms
of
that
painful
disease
i
doctored
continually
my
diet
daily
becoming
more
rigid
until
three
slices
of
toast
became
my
daily
allowance
of
food
in
this
condition
i
left
the
east
for
my
home
in
chicago
hoping
that
a
change
of
climate
might
benefit
me
after
spending
six
weeks
there
and
finding
no
relief
i
concluded
to
return
east
the
sunday
morning
before
leaving
i
picked
up
a
sunday
paper
and
glancing
through
the
religious
items
my
eyes
fell
on
the
notices
of
christian
science
church
services
curiosity
led
me
to
a
service
and
i
shall
never
forget
that
morning
or
the
surprise
and
joy
it
gave
me
to
find
that
beautiful
church
and
to
know
that
so
great
a
number
actually
believed
that
god
does
heal
the
sick
this
brought
a
first
ray
of
hope
the
evening
service
found
me
there
again
among
the
notices
read
was
that
of
a
reading
room
giving
the
location
and
time
of
opening
monday
morning
found
me
there
promptly
and
the
first
book
i
picked
up
was
science
and
health
which
opened
a
new
world
to
me
i
had
dieted
so
long
and
suffered
so
much
that
i
had
a
morbid
fear
of
food
when
i
had
reached
and
read
of
neither
food
nor
the
stomach
without
the
consent
of
mortal
mind
can
make
one
suffer
science
and
health
i
left
the
reading
room
for
something
to
eat
i
found
a
bakery
near
by
and
bought
a
bag
of
cakes
which
i
ate
and
shortly
after
i
had
a
hearty
dinner
without
the
least
complaint
from
my
stomach
from
that
time
until
now
i
have
eaten
anything
that
i
wished
and
the
craving
for
cigarettes
which
i
had
for
many
years
has
entirely
vanished
the
understanding
of
truth
which
entirely
relieved
the
diseased
stomach
healed
also
the
morbid
appetite
for
smoking
after
coming
back
east
i
bought
a
copy
of
science
and
health
which
i
have
read
daily
and
find
it
a
continual
help
in
all
the
affairs
of
life
in
my
home
and
at
work
i
find
this
science
a
comfort
and
source
of
strength
i
have
had
many
difficulties
in
the
way
but
it
has
helped
me
out
of
them
all
new
britain
spinal
disease
healed
when
i
first
heard
of
christian
science
seven
years
ago
i
supposed
that
it
was
some
old
fad
under
a
new
name
in
the
little
texas
town
where
we
then
lived
there
were
two
or
three
christian
scientists
who
met
at
the
home
of
one
of
their
number
to
read
the
meeting
one
of
them
one
day
i
asked
if
unbelievers
could
come
to
their
meetings
she
said
that
they
could
if
they
wanted
to
i
went
expecting
them
to
do
something
that
i
could
laugh
at
when
telling
my
friends
about
it
how
surprised
i
was
to
find
out
that
they
did
do
anything
but
read
the
bible
and
another
book
which
they
called
science
and
health
i
still
thought
it
all
foolishness
but
resolved
to
go
to
their
meetings
until
i
found
out
all
they
believed
i
continued
to
go
until
i
began
to
understand
a
little
of
what
they
knew
not
what
they
believed
and
instead
of
spending
my
time
telling
others
what
a
silly
thing
christian
science
is
i
am
now
trying
to
find
words
to
tell
what
a
great
and
wonderful
thing
it
is
i
have
been
healed
of
incurable
spinal
disease
of
ten
years
standing
by
studying
the
bible
and
science
and
health
science
and
health
has
been
my
only
teacher
and
i
wish
to
send
my
thanks
to
our
dear
leader
there
are
no
other
scientists
near
where
we
now
live
but
i
have
the
study
the
lessons
by
myself
i
have
five
small
children
and
christian
science
is
invaluable
to
me
in
controlling
them
and
in
overcoming
their
common
ills
they
often
help
themselves
and
each
other
to
destroy
their
little
hurts
and
fears
oleta
okla
many
troubles
overcome
in
the
second
chapter
of
first
peter
ninth
verse
i
read
that
ye
should
show
forth
the
praises
of
him
who
hath
called
you
out
of
darkness
into
his
marvellous
light
the
periodicals
so
wisely
established
by
our
leader
give
us
one
means
of
showing
forth
the
praises
of
truth
from
the
darkness
of
physical
pain
and
weariness
into
the
light
of
wholeness
and
joyousness
in
work
and
living
from
the
darkness
of
a
clouded
sight
into
the
light
of
clearer
vision
from
the
darkness
of
doubt
and
discord
into
the
marvellous
light
of
the
reality
of
good
this
is
what
a
reading
of
the
christian
science
textbook
has
done
for
me
at
the
time
the
book
was
lent
to
me
i
was
ing
in
the
public
schools
of
chicago
and
absences
from
my
work
on
account
of
illness
were
of
frequent
occurrence
for
five
weeks
i
had
been
under
the
care
of
a
specialist
for
an
organic
trouble
and
he
said
i
would
have
to
come
as
many
more
months
before
a
cure
could
be
effected
at
this
time
science
and
health
was
brought
to
my
notice
i
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
as
being
healed
by
the
reading
of
the
book
but
my
thought
was
so
changed
that
i
was
healed
not
only
of
the
organic
trouble
but
of
blurred
eyesight
fatigue
and
a
train
of
other
discordant
manifestations
i
did
not
go
back
to
the
physician
until
four
months
later
to
pay
my
bill
which
by
the
way
was
more
than
five
times
the
price
of
the
science
and
health
i
had
purchased
from
the
time
i
read
the
book
i
taught
steadily
without
losing
time
from
my
work
i
was
helped
too
with
my
work
in
many
other
ways
through
reading
the
textbook
i
learned
that
god
has
given
us
strength
to
do
all
we
have
to
do
and
that
it
is
the
things
we
do
not
have
to
do
the
envying
strife
emulating
vainglorying
and
so
on
that
leave
in
their
wake
fatigue
and
discord
gratitude
to
our
beloved
leader
eddy
and
to
her
faithful
students
with
whom
i
afterwards
became
associated
can
be
expressed
only
by
daily
efforts
to
put
into
practice
what
has
been
taught
madison
wis
prejudice
overcome
i
became
interested
in
christian
science
somewhat
over
three
years
ago
when
in
much
need
of
help
i
had
never
been
strong
and
as
i
grew
older
i
grew
weaker
and
at
last
became
so
ill
that
life
was
a
burden
to
me
science
and
health
by
eddy
was
sent
to
me
in
answer
to
prayer
as
i
thought
i
was
a
little
afraid
of
all
these
new
fads
as
i
thought
them
but
i
had
not
read
far
before
i
felt
that
i
had
found
the
truth
which
makes
us
free
i
was
healed
of
stomach
trouble
inward
weakness
and
bilious
attacks
one
physician
said
i
might
have
to
undergo
an
operation
before
i
could
get
well
but
thanks
to
this
truth
i
have
found
that
the
only
operation
needed
was
the
regeneration
of
this
human
mind
by
learning
to
know
god
in
many
cases
i
have
been
able
to
help
myself
and
others
words
can
not
express
my
thanks
to
eddy
and
to
all
who
are
bringing
these
great
truths
to
the
help
of
the
whole
world
huntington
a
convincing
testimony
i
became
interested
in
christian
science
some
five
years
ago
the
practical
nature
of
its
statements
appealing
to
me
and
i
must
say
at
the
outset
that
with
my
little
experience
i
have
found
it
all
and
more
than
i
ever
dreamt
of
realizing
on
this
plane
of
existence
i
am
satisfied
that
i
have
found
truth
god
is
indeed
to
me
an
help
my
little
girl
some
ten
months
old
was
afflicted
with
constipation
it
was
so
severe
i
dreaded
to
go
out
anywhere
with
her
as
i
knew
not
when
she
would
be
taken
with
a
convulsion
i
had
tried
all
the
usual
remedies
in
such
cases
but
it
seemed
to
grow
more
obstinate
there
was
a
christian
scientist
living
in
the
same
house
with
us
a
scientist
who
let
her
light
shine
and
while
she
said
little
i
felt
the
reflection
of
love
i
had
no
knowledge
of
the
teachings
of
christian
science
save
that
god
was
the
physician
at
all
times
in
my
own
way
i
believed
he
was
and
i
said
to
my
husband
one
day
i
am
through
with
medicine
for
baby
i
am
just
going
to
leave
her
in
god
care
and
see
what
he
will
do
i
have
done
all
i
can
i
did
as
i
said
laid
my
burden
at
god
feet
and
did
not
pick
it
up
again
in
two
days
the
child
was
perfectly
natural
and
has
since
been
free
from
the
trouble
she
is
now
six
years
of
age
some
months
later
a
second
test
came
she
woke
up
at
nine
at
night
crying
and
holding
her
ear
there
was
to
sense
a
gathering
i
was
alone
i
took
up
my
science
and
health
and
bible
but
the
more
i
worked
the
louder
she
screamed
error
kept
suggesting
material
remedies
but
i
said
firmly
no
i
shall
not
go
back
to
error
god
will
help
me
just
then
i
thought
of
my
own
fear
how
excessive
it
was
and
a
conversation
i
had
with
the
scientist
who
first
voiced
the
truth
to
me
came
to
mind
she
said
she
always
found
it
helpful
to
treat
herself
and
cast
out
her
own
fear
before
treating
a
patient
i
put
baby
down
and
again
took
up
my
science
and
health
and
these
were
the
words
i
read
every
trial
of
our
faith
in
god
makes
us
stronger
the
more
difficult
seems
the
material
condition
to
be
overcome
by
spirit
the
stronger
should
be
our
faith
and
the
purer
our
love
the
apostle
john
says
is
no
fear
in
love
but
perfect
love
casteth
out
fear
science
and
health
i
looked
up
the
crying
had
ceased
the
child
was
smiling
and
in
a
few
minutes
asked
to
be
put
to
bed
there
has
been
no
further
trouble
of
that
kind
i
have
since
seen
the
power
of
truth
overcome
error
of
many
forms
including
croup
tonsilitis
etc
i
am
thankful
for
all
these
proofs
but
far
more
grateful
am
i
for
the
spiritual
teaching
to
love
to
forgive
to
curb
my
tongue
and
cease
my
criticism
brockton
mass
healed
physically
and
spiritually
i
had
been
taking
medicine
continually
for
many
years
finally
i
was
taken
suddenly
ill
and
could
not
leave
my
room
for
about
two
months
then
i
went
away
for
three
months
thinking
that
i
should
come
back
and
be
able
to
continue
my
work
i
improved
very
much
but
the
fear
of
quick
consumption
was
with
my
doctor
and
my
family
and
friends
and
i
was
warned
about
the
coming
winter
only
too
soon
the
fear
manifested
itself
i
had
worked
just
three
weeks
when
all
the
pains
and
aches
returned
and
i
had
to
go
to
bed
as
soon
as
i
got
home
so
there
was
no
pleasure
in
living
my
employer
advised
me
to
see
my
physician
and
said
perhaps
i
should
not
work
that
winter
i
then
and
there
turned
to
christian
science
i
could
not
afford
to
give
up
work
and
live
away
from
home
neither
did
i
want
to
depend
on
doctors
and
medicine
any
longer
i
took
the
book
and
read
it
on
my
way
to
work
and
at
noon
i
lay
down
on
a
couch
instead
of
going
out
for
luncheon
and
fell
asleep
when
i
awoke
i
was
a
different
person
all
pains
and
aches
had
gone
and
i
was
free
i
was
so
happy
i
could
hardly
contain
myself
to
material
sense
it
was
wonderful
as
i
walked
i
kept
saying
wonderful
wonderful
wonderful
and
tried
to
understand
the
scientific
statement
of
being
by
repeating
portions
at
a
time
then
pondering
over
them
i
read
the
book
four
times
in
succession
and
every
time
i
found
more
and
more
to
aid
in
the
understanding
this
healing
was
in
october
with
no
other
help
than
science
and
health
and
soon
i
was
relieved
of
other
chronic
ailments
in
february
i
was
able
to
put
away
eyeglasses
which
i
had
worn
ten
years
and
a
half
for
astigmatism
oculists
told
me
i
would
always
have
to
wear
them
a
month
later
my
father
asked
me
to
help
him
as
he
was
suffering
so
much
from
constipation
dyspepsia
and
neuralgia
he
had
been
subsisting
on
bran
nearly
starving
himself
until
be
was
most
miserable
and
his
limbs
seemed
so
cold
that
they
were
kept
wrapped
in
blankets
i
felt
very
humble
as
he
asked
me
and
told
him
i
would
have
a
practitioner
help
him
as
i
had
never
treated
any
one
but
he
would
not
consent
to
have
any
one
but
myself
and
i
finally
told
him
i
would
try
but
that
he
must
not
hold
science
responsible
if
he
were
not
benefited
for
my
lack
of
understanding
and
not
science
would
be
at
fault
at
my
request
he
read
science
and
health
ate
whatever
he
wanted
and
used
no
medicine
in
any
form
after
two
treatments
i
received
word
from
him
that
he
was
healed
of
that
bondage
of
thirty
years
standing
in
view
of
all
these
signs
which
followed
my
acceptance
of
christian
science
i
knew
it
must
be
true
chicago
a
voice
from
the
south
i
was
delicate
from
childhood
and
my
parents
did
not
think
it
was
possible
for
me
to
live
more
than
a
few
years
i
lived
however
although
there
was
not
much
improvement
in
my
health
travel
and
change
of
climate
brought
only
temporary
relief
and
the
physicians
gave
me
no
hope
that
i
would
ever
be
well
as
a
last
resort
i
began
the
study
of
science
and
health
and
before
i
had
finished
reading
the
book
i
realized
that
its
author
was
divinely
commissioned
to
bring
this
spiritual
message
to
a
waiting
world
through
this
reading
my
health
was
restored
and
i
was
healed
of
one
disease
that
has
been
called
incurable
by
all
physicians
for
this
together
with
the
greater
and
higher
blessing
of
having
the
spiritual
fact
of
being
unfolded
to
me
i
am
most
grateful
what
shall
be
rendered
for
such
benefits
received
and
made
possible
by
the
consecrated
life
of
our
revered
leader
only
by
following
the
teachings
of
our
textbook
and
by
loving
obedience
to
her
gentle
and
timely
admonitions
can
we
show
our
true
sense
of
gratitude
de
funiak
springs
healed
after
much
suffering
a
testimony
given
in
the
journal
led
me
to
investigate
christian
science
and
i
hope
in
return
to
be
the
means
of
leading
some
one
else
to
see
the
beauty
of
this
saving
truth
and
to
learn
to
know
god
aright
and
man
relationship
to
him
i
know
from
experience
that
it
is
prejudice
and
misapprehension
of
what
christian
science
is
that
keeps
many
from
enjoying
the
blessings
it
bestows
i
had
been
taking
patent
medicines
for
several
years
and
had
been
to
one
of
the
best
sanitariums
in
this
country
but
was
not
healed
although
i
received
some
benefit
for
which
i
shall
always
feel
grateful
for
i
know
the
physicians
did
all
they
could
for
me
i
sometimes
thought
i
had
exhausted
all
remedies
but
did
not
give
up
for
i
felt
there
must
be
something
to
heal
me
if
i
could
find
it
when
in
this
state
of
mind
christian
science
came
to
my
notice
and
after
reading
several
purchased
a
copy
of
science
and
health
i
read
for
several
days
at
odd
times
i
commenced
to
improve
and
in
about
a
week
i
was
healed
of
most
of
my
ills
among
which
were
dyspepsia
and
nervous
debility
although
i
had
heard
about
christian
science
before
i
had
never
heard
that
the
reading
of
the
christian
science
textbook
had
ever
effected
the
healing
of
anybody
i
commenced
reading
to
find
out
what
christian
science
was
but
was
surprised
to
find
myself
improving
and
was
soon
assured
that
it
was
the
theology
of
science
and
health
that
healed
me
just
as
it
was
the
theology
of
jesus
that
healed
the
sick
it
has
also
proved
to
me
that
there
can
be
no
christian
science
church
that
does
not
heal
the
sick
and
sinful
for
healing
follows
as
the
natural
result
of
the
teaching
of
christian
science
the
bible
has
become
a
new
revelation
to
me
and
i
can
read
it
much
more
understandingly
by
the
light
received
through
the
reading
of
science
and
health
fairmont
minn
through
great
tribulations
when
i
attempt
to
make
plain
what
christian
science
has
done
for
me
words
fail
me
for
twenty
years
i
was
a
constant
sufferer
my
spine
having
been
injured
when
i
was
very
young
as
a
little
child
i
suffered
so
much
that
i
would
look
up
to
the
stars
and
beg
god
who
i
thought
might
be
up
there
somewhere
to
take
me
away
from
the
earth
i
was
so
tired
a
great
wall
of
pain
seemed
to
separate
me
from
the
pleasures
enjoyed
by
others
and
i
could
not
explain
how
i
felt
because
no
one
could
understand
years
passed
and
i
saw
my
earthly
happiness
swept
away
my
heart
was
broken
and
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
i
cried
for
help
day
after
day
and
night
after
night
although
i
was
not
sure
what
god
was
nor
where
he
was
i
only
knew
that
i
suffered
and
was
in
need
of
help
and
that
there
was
no
earthly
help
for
either
mind
or
body
i
loved
purity
truth
and
right
always
and
this
made
evil
seem
a
most
terrible
reality
i
was
unable
to
cope
with
it
and
so
found
myself
in
despair
this
was
my
condition
when
i
commenced
reading
science
and
health
i
was
ready
for
its
message
and
in
about
ten
days
there
came
a
wonderful
insight
into
the
truth
which
heals
the
sick
and
binds
up
the
all
pain
left
me
i
had
a
glimpse
of
the
new
heavens
and
the
new
earth
and
was
beginning
to
be
fed
by
love
divine
i
had
suffered
for
years
with
insomnia
that
night
i
rested
like
a
child
and
awoke
the
next
morning
well
and
happy
a
flood
of
light
daily
illumined
the
pages
of
the
little
book
and
the
revelation
it
holds
for
all
came
to
my
waiting
heart
the
peace
which
passeth
all
understanding
rested
upon
me
and
joy
too
deep
for
words
transformed
my
life
my
prayers
were
answered
for
i
had
found
god
in
christian
science
the
bible
which
i
knew
very
little
about
became
my
constant
study
my
joy
and
my
guide
the
copy
which
i
bought
at
the
time
of
my
healing
is
marked
from
genesis
to
revelation
it
was
so
constantly
in
my
hands
for
three
years
that
the
cover
became
worn
and
the
leaves
loose
so
it
has
been
laid
away
for
a
new
one
two
and
three
in
the
morning
often
found
me
poring
over
its
pages
which
grew
more
and
more
sacred
to
me
every
day
and
the
help
i
received
therefrom
was
wonderful
for
which
i
can
find
no
words
to
express
iny
gratitude
los
angeles
cal
a
helpful
testimony
words
can
not
express
my
gratitude
to
god
for
christian
science
when
i
first
read
science
and
health
i
had
tried
every
remedy
i
had
ever
heard
of
i
felt
no
change
in
mind
or
body
that
i
was
conscious
of
until
i
read
page
of
the
chapter
on
prayer
in
science
and
health
the
first
words
of
the
spiritual
sense
of
the
lord
prayer
telling
of
our
god
gave
me
a
glimpse
of
heavenly
light
i
stopped
and
reasoned
and
remembered
the
teachings
of
jesus
the
truth
of
spiritual
being
dawned
on
my
consciousness
i
realized
i
was
not
subject
to
mortal
laws
as
i
had
been
taught
all
my
life
i
could
not
explain
how
i
knew
this
but
i
knew
it
through
christian
science
eddy
had
given
me
what
i
had
longed
for
all
my
life
a
mother
a
perfect
god
i
had
known
there
was
a
great
lack
and
at
that
time
i
believe
the
orthodox
world
had
but
half
of
the
truth
which
jesus
came
to
establish
when
i
read
give
us
this
day
our
daily
bread
and
its
spiritual
interpretation
my
tears
began
to
flow
all
the
years
of
bitterness
hate
and
fear
melted
away
i
knew
then
as
i
know
now
that
nothing
satisfies
but
love
that
day
began
the
outward
and
inward
conscious
healing
mental
and
physical
there
never
came
a
doubt
i
absolutely
knew
that
christian
science
was
and
is
the
truth
money
friends
materiality
are
nothing
beside
the
conscious
knowledge
of
god
man
and
the
universe
i
did
not
need
treatment
from
any
one
science
and
health
was
so
clear
and
beautiful
i
could
not
understand
the
bible
before
but
i
found
it
illumined
now
that
i
had
a
little
understanding
of
christian
science
for
ten
years
i
have
not
had
to
lie
down
in
the
daytime
from
any
sickness
i
am
now
and
have
been
all
these
years
the
picture
of
perfect
health
when
i
first
read
science
and
health
i
weighed
one
hundred
and
four
pounds
i
now
weigh
over
one
hundred
and
sixty
this
physical
health
is
not
to
be
compared
to
my
happiness
my
harmony
that
nothing
can
take
away
because
it
is
the
gift
of
god
nothing
has
shown
me
the
perversity
of
the
human
mind
more
than
in
its
conclusions
in
regard
to
my
healing
even
when
i
felt
and
knew
that
i
was
healed
people
constantly
said
because
i
was
thin
and
delicate
looking
you
are
not
well
any
one
could
look
at
you
and
know
it
now
that
i
am
fleshy
they
say
you
do
look
as
if
you
ever
had
a
pain
in
all
your
life
you
could
not
have
had
consumption
when
i
think
what
my
life
was
before
i
had
christian
science
of
the
six
years
of
colds
suffering
and
coughing
not
to
mention
the
unhappiness
i
want
to
work
watch
and
pray
for
the
mind
of
christ
that
i
may
work
rightly
in
god
vineyard
and
to
know
that
in
truth
what
belongs
to
one
belongs
to
all
that
one
god
one
life
truth
and
love
is
all
kansas
city
kans
desire
for
liquor
and
tobacco
disappeared
i
first
heard
of
christian
science
four
years
ago
at
that
time
drinking
and
smoking
were
my
comforters
i
had
no
other
companionship
i
had
lived
almost
constantly
from
childhood
in
an
evil
atmosphere
though
i
was
far
from
being
satisfied
with
my
condition
i
failed
to
see
how
to
better
it
until
i
read
science
and
health
i
used
occasionally
to
listen
to
a
sermon
but
sermons
did
not
give
me
any
more
comfort
than
i
derived
from
my
pipe
hence
i
concluded
that
could
not
satisfy
me
and
i
preferred
drinking
and
smoking
when
i
began
to
read
science
and
health
i
saw
it
offered
something
substantial
after
a
few
study
all
desire
for
drinking
and
smoking
disappeared
i
did
not
give
them
up
i
made
no
sacrifices
i
simply
found
something
better
i
might
mention
that
i
had
smoked
ever
since
i
can
remember
i
used
to
smoke
years
before
i
left
school
and
like
most
englishmen
loved
my
pipe
and
would
almost
prefer
to
miss
a
meal
rather
than
to
go
without
my
smoke
i
used
to
think
it
gave
me
comfort
during
my
four
years
study
of
christian
science
i
have
not
spent
a
cent
for
doctors
or
medicine
neither
have
i
lost
a
day
from
my
work
on
account
of
sickness
which
compares
wonderfully
with
the
previous
four
years
i
take
a
great
interest
and
pleasure
in
reading
the
bible
and
studying
the
lessons
in
the
the
bible
used
to
be
a
most
mysterious
book
to
me
but
science
and
health
makes
it
a
most
precious
book
making
its
meaning
clearer
plainer
and
simpler
i
take
this
opportunity
to
express
my
gratitude
to
eddy
and
to
the
friend
who
invited
me
to
attend
the
service
held
in
the
auditorium
years
ago
i
also
wish
to
acknowledge
the
benefit
i
have
had
from
the
and
the
have
helped
me
wonderfully
if
the
value
of
science
and
health
and
these
publications
were
measured
as
business
men
value
things
by
the
results
or
benefits
they
bring
they
certainly
would
be
priceless
to
me
it
would
be
impossible
to
measure
their
value
as
i
have
got
something
from
science
and
health
that
all
the
money
in
the
world
could
not
buy
chicago
an
expression
of
loving
gratitude
in
the
spring
of
while
studying
for
the
ministry
science
and
health
was
placed
in
my
hands
and
the
truth
contained
therein
at
once
became
to
me
the
pearl
of
great
price
i
literally
devoured
the
book
reading
it
about
eighteen
hours
a
day
its
originality
was
startling
upsetting
my
preconceived
opinions
of
god
man
and
creation
two
sentences
especially
appealed
to
me
the
foundation
of
mortal
discord
is
a
false
sense
of
man
origin
and
for
right
reasoning
there
should
be
but
one
fact
before
the
thought
namely
spiritual
existence
i
had
found
the
keynote
to
the
science
of
being
as
taught
in
this
marvellous
book
and
persevered
until
a
glimpse
of
the
new
heavens
and
new
earth
came
for
the
old
were
passing
away
with
this
spiritual
uplifting
came
also
physical
health
all
my
life
had
been
spent
in
and
i
seemed
destined
to
a
life
of
suffering
in
three
weeks
after
beginning
science
and
health
to
my
joyful
surprise
i
found
myself
a
well
man
sound
physically
and
uplifted
spiritually
life
was
being
lived
from
a
new
basis
the
old
things
of
personal
sense
were
passing
away
and
all
things
becoming
new
i
learned
that
the
infinite
good
is
the
one
friend
upon
whom
we
can
call
at
all
times
an
help
in
every
time
of
trouble
that
his
children
are
really
governed
in
peace
and
harmony
by
spiritual
law
and
as
the
right
understanding
of
it
is
gained
the
other
things
soon
follow
bringing
a
peace
the
human
concept
can
never
know
for
the
last
twelve
years
my
whole
time
has
been
devoted
to
christian
science
practice
and
i
have
seen
nearly
every
incurable
disease
healed
by
its
beneficent
influence
god
bless
our
dear
leader
she
has
set
before
us
an
open
door
which
no
man
can
shut
and
it
is
but
a
question
of
time
when
the
world
will
know
her
better
and
love
her
more
washington
healed
of
bright
disease
august
i
was
taken
down
with
what
three
doctors
pronounced
bright
disease
and
they
stated
that
i
would
not
live
a
year
or
if
i
did
succeed
in
living
longer
i
would
be
mentally
unbalanced
on
december
my
wife
presented
me
with
science
and
health
as
a
birthday
gift
and
it
was
indeed
the
best
present
i
ever
received
since
that
time
i
have
been
reading
it
and
attending
the
second
church
here
i
have
not
used
any
medicine
since
nor
has
any
one
in
our
home
i
am
in
the
finest
of
health
and
have
lost
all
my
bad
habits
this
truth
has
brought
a
great
spiritual
uplifting
to
all
of
us
and
words
can
not
express
my
gratitude
to
eddy
and
to
all
who
have
helped
me
to
the
same
chicago
fibroid
tumor
destroyed
when
quite
young
i
was
impressed
that
the
bible
was
not
properly
interpreted
by
the
preachers
for
i
could
not
conceive
of
a
god
of
wrath
who
was
unjust
enough
to
allow
his
little
ones
to
suffer
pain
misery
and
death
i
had
hope
however
that
some
day
the
truth
would
be
revealed
to
an
awakening
world
but
little
did
i
dream
that
even
then
there
was
one
of
god
noble
women
who
reflected
sufficient
purity
and
holiness
to
entertain
the
angel
of
his
presence
and
commune
with
the
true
god
i
was
believed
to
be
predisposed
to
scrofula
so
that
i
was
not
a
strong
or
attractive
child
and
my
girlhood
and
womanhood
were
scarcely
ever
free
from
dread
of
the
laws
of
matter
and
lack
of
strength
the
climax
was
reached
when
a
physician
informed
me
after
weeks
of
treatment
that
i
had
a
fibroid
tumor
which
required
an
operation
the
conditions
were
most
trying
and
i
was
heartsick
and
discouraged
when
in
january
i
heard
of
christian
science
through
a
letter
from
a
dear
sister
who
had
been
greatly
benefited
thereby
and
i
resolved
to
go
at
once
to
a
practitioner
for
i
believed
it
to
be
the
truth
that
would
make
me
free
it
meant
a
great
effort
and
sacrifice
for
me
to
go
to
chicago
at
that
time
but
divine
love
opened
the
way
and
i
reached
there
in
march
i
had
been
in
my
sister
home
but
a
few
days
reading
science
and
health
almost
constantly
when
i
asked
her
if
i
had
not
better
have
treatment
for
the
tumor
which
had
given
me
so
much
trouble
she
said
to
me
you
feel
well
do
you
not
i
assured
her
that
i
never
had
felt
so
well
as
i
had
since
reaching
there
well
she
said
with
decision
your
tumor
is
gone
for
god
never
made
it
and
her
statements
were
true
for
it
has
never
been
heard
of
from
that
day
since
then
i
have
been
healed
of
chronic
sore
throat
hay
fever
and
other
troubles
and
i
know
that
christian
science
is
the
truth
coldwater
light
out
of
darkness
i
have
received
so
much
benefit
from
the
testimonies
in
the
i
send
mine
hoping
it
may
cheer
some
struggling
heart
i
was
reared
by
kind
and
loving
christian
parents
and
was
a
member
of
an
orthodox
church
for
over
twenty
years
but
i
was
never
satisfied
i
was
filled
with
fear
and
bound
down
by
the
false
gods
of
this
world
sin
disease
and
poverty
consequently
every
way
i
turned
and
in
everything
i
attempted
to
do
i
was
met
with
disappointment
and
failure
but
god
was
leading
me
into
a
different
life
my
interest
was
first
awakened
to
christian
science
about
thirteen
years
ago
and
i
have
been
a
willing
disciple
ever
since
through
the
reading
of
science
and
health
i
was
healed
of
chronic
catarrh
and
laryngitis
and
it
also
enabled
me
to
lay
off
my
glasses
christian
science
has
not
only
helped
me
mentally
morally
and
physically
but
the
greatest
blessing
of
all
is
the
spiritual
uplifting
which
enabled
me
to
know
that
god
is
both
able
and
willing
to
care
for
his
children
if
we
are
but
willing
to
do
our
part
and
bear
the
cross
which
though
it
seems
heavy
at
times
always
brings
a
sure
reward
christian
science
has
not
only
helped
me
but
it
has
enabled
me
to
help
others
the
bible
is
a
new
book
to
me
i
now
see
what
jesus
meant
when
he
said
come
unto
me
all
ye
that
labor
and
are
heavy
laden
and
i
will
give
you
rest
my
heart
goes
out
in
gratitude
to
eddy
for
the
work
she
has
done
and
is
still
doing
for
the
world
and
to
god
i
am
most
grateful
that
he
has
guided
me
into
the
truth
that
i
may
have
life
and
have
it
more
abundantly
chicago
a
priceless
boon
i
have
long
desired
to
express
my
gratitude
for
what
christian
science
has
done
through
reading
science
and
health
for
me
and
my
family
i
was
healed
of
profanity
the
tobacco
habit
and
a
bad
temper
through
the
understanding
that
man
is
the
image
and
likeness
of
god
i
was
also
healed
of
kidney
disease
and
rheumatism
what
surprised
me
most
however
was
this
i
had
had
one
finger
thrown
out
of
place
some
fifteen
years
before
it
was
crooked
but
it
became
straight
and
useful
a
bone
in
my
foot
had
also
been
broken
leaving
a
bunch
which
disappeared
after
i
studied
christian
science
and
received
class
instruction
i
am
an
entirely
well
man
and
for
this
i
am
very
grateful
i
am
also
glad
that
i
have
learned
enough
of
truth
and
love
to
be
able
to
heal
others
i
wish
to
express
my
thankful
appreciation
of
our
leader
also
of
the
and
the
salina
kans
healed
of
consumption
and
asthma
it
is
a
pleasure
to
acknowledge
the
great
benefits
which
have
come
to
me
through
christian
science
it
is
nearly
ten
years
since
i
began
the
investigation
of
the
subject
by
borrowing
a
copy
of
science
and
health
i
had
become
a
hopeless
sufferer
from
asthma
the
disease
being
so
aggravated
at
times
as
to
make
breathing
almost
impossible
i
was
also
a
victim
of
that
dread
disease
consumption
it
was
hereditary
nearly
all
my
family
on
both
sides
having
passed
away
with
it
i
took
up
christian
science
very
much
as
a
drowning
man
catches
at
a
straw
however
i
was
much
interested
as
soon
as
i
began
to
understand
it
and
having
read
the
book
nearly
all
my
waking
hours
for
a
few
weeks
i
became
so
much
better
and
so
convinced
of
its
truth
that
myself
and
wife
destroyed
all
the
medicines
in
the
home
and
have
never
since
used
any
remedy
except
christian
science
i
continued
to
study
and
to
put
into
practice
the
teaching
as
best
i
knew
and
was
restored
to
health
in
a
few
months
prior
to
my
investigation
of
christian
science
i
had
been
from
boyhood
an
outspoken
infidel
had
read
that
class
of
literature
extensively
and
had
no
desire
for
anything
of
a
religious
nature
the
orthodox
teaching
never
having
appealed
to
me
as
a
rational
exposition
of
an
god
i
now
have
no
more
doubt
of
the
truth
of
the
teaching
of
the
great
jesus
of
nazareth
than
i
doubt
the
correctness
of
the
basic
law
of
mathematics
or
music
i
have
no
doubt
whatever
that
christian
science
saved
me
from
the
grave
and
thus
proved
a
most
practicable
and
efficient
help
in
time
of
greatest
need
however
great
my
physical
suffering
has
been
i
can
but
feel
glad
that
through
it
the
door
of
consciousness
was
opened
to
let
in
the
light
of
truth
thus
i
have
progressed
a
little
way
in
the
knowledge
of
god
good
as
revealed
in
christian
science
webb
city
mo
a
grateful
testimony
thy
word
is
a
lamp
unto
my
feet
and
a
light
unto
my
this
has
been
proven
to
me
in
every
way
when
christian
science
came
to
me
i
was
a
wreck
physically
mentally
and
financially
but
since
the
reading
of
science
and
health
turned
my
thought
toward
the
light
i
have
found
that
as
far
as
i
am
willing
to
receive
the
word
and
live
it
all
comforts
are
supplied
me
i
am
especially
grateful
for
the
spiritual
help
i
know
that
things
which
i
did
and
thought
last
year
i
would
not
do
or
think
this
year
and
am
satisfied
through
the
careful
and
prayerful
study
of
science
and
health
i
have
been
lifted
from
sickness
to
health
from
sorrow
to
peace
from
lack
to
plenty
and
the
most
beautiful
of
all
from
darkness
to
light
