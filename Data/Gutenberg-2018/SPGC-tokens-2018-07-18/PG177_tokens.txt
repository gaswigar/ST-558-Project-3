on
a
brilliant
day
in
may
in
the
year
a
gentleman
was
reclining
at
his
ease
on
the
great
circular
divan
which
at
that
period
occupied
the
centre
of
the
salon
carré
in
the
museum
of
the
louvre
this
commodious
ottoman
has
since
been
removed
to
the
extreme
regret
of
all
lovers
of
the
fine
arts
but
the
gentleman
in
question
had
taken
serene
possession
of
its
softest
spot
and
with
his
head
thrown
back
and
his
legs
outstretched
was
staring
at
murillo
s
beautiful
madonna
in
profound
enjoyment
of
his
posture
he
had
removed
his
hat
and
flung
down
beside
him
a
little
red
and
an
the
day
was
warm
he
was
heated
with
walking
and
he
repeatedly
passed
his
handkerchief
over
his
forehead
with
a
somewhat
wearied
gesture
and
yet
he
was
evidently
not
a
man
to
whom
fatigue
was
familiar
long
lean
and
muscular
he
suggested
the
sort
of
vigor
that
is
commonly
known
as
but
his
exertions
on
this
particular
day
had
been
of
an
unwonted
sort
and
he
had
performed
great
physical
feats
which
left
him
less
jaded
than
his
tranquil
stroll
through
the
louvre
he
had
looked
out
all
the
pictures
to
which
an
asterisk
was
affixed
in
those
formidable
pages
of
fine
print
in
his
bädeker
his
attention
had
been
strained
and
his
eyes
dazzled
and
he
had
sat
down
with
an
æsthetic
headache
he
had
looked
moreover
not
only
at
all
the
pictures
but
at
all
the
copies
that
were
going
forward
around
them
in
the
hands
of
those
innumerable
young
women
in
irreproachable
toilets
who
devote
themselves
in
france
to
the
propagation
of
masterpieces
and
if
the
truth
must
be
told
he
had
often
admired
the
copy
much
more
than
the
original
his
physiognomy
would
have
sufficiently
indicated
that
he
was
a
shrewd
and
capable
fellow
and
in
truth
he
had
often
sat
up
all
night
over
a
bristling
bundle
of
accounts
and
heard
the
cock
crow
without
a
yawn
but
raphael
and
titian
and
rubens
were
a
new
kind
of
arithmetic
and
they
inspired
our
friend
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
with
a
vague
an
observer
with
anything
of
an
eye
for
national
types
would
have
had
no
difficulty
in
determining
the
local
origin
of
this
undeveloped
connoisseur
and
indeed
such
an
observer
might
have
felt
a
certain
humorous
relish
of
the
almost
ideal
completeness
with
which
he
filled
out
the
national
mould
the
gentleman
on
the
divan
was
a
powerful
specimen
of
an
american
but
he
was
not
only
a
fine
american
he
was
in
the
first
place
physically
a
fine
man
he
appeared
to
possess
that
kind
of
health
and
strength
which
when
found
in
perfection
are
the
most
impressive
the
physical
capital
which
the
owner
does
nothing
to
keep
if
he
was
a
muscular
christian
it
was
quite
without
knowing
it
if
it
was
necessary
to
walk
to
a
remote
spot
he
walked
but
he
had
never
known
himself
to
he
had
no
theory
with
regard
to
cold
bathing
or
the
use
of
indian
clubs
he
was
neither
an
oarsman
a
rifleman
nor
a
fencer
he
had
never
had
time
for
these
amusements
and
he
was
quite
unaware
that
the
saddle
is
recommended
for
certain
forms
of
indigestion
he
was
by
inclination
a
temperate
man
but
he
had
supped
the
night
before
his
visit
to
the
louvre
at
the
café
anglais
someone
had
told
him
it
was
an
experience
not
to
be
omitted
and
he
had
slept
none
the
less
the
sleep
of
the
just
his
usual
attitude
and
carriage
were
of
a
rather
relaxed
and
lounging
kind
but
when
under
a
special
inspiration
he
straightened
himself
he
looked
like
a
grenadier
on
parade
he
never
smoked
he
had
been
assured
such
things
are
said
that
cigars
were
excellent
for
the
health
and
he
was
quite
capable
of
believing
it
but
he
knew
as
little
about
tobacco
as
about
homœopathy
he
had
a
very
head
with
a
shapely
symmetrical
balance
of
the
frontal
and
the
occipital
development
and
a
good
deal
of
straight
rather
dry
brown
hair
his
complexion
was
brown
and
his
nose
had
a
bold
arch
his
eye
was
of
a
clear
cold
gray
and
save
for
a
rather
abundant
moustache
he
was
he
had
the
flat
jaw
and
sinewy
neck
which
are
frequent
in
the
american
type
but
the
traces
of
national
origin
are
a
matter
of
expression
even
more
than
of
feature
and
it
was
in
this
respect
that
our
friend
s
countenance
was
supremely
eloquent
the
discriminating
observer
we
have
been
supposing
might
however
perfectly
have
measured
its
expressiveness
and
yet
have
been
at
a
loss
to
describe
it
it
had
that
typical
vagueness
which
is
not
vacuity
that
blankness
which
is
not
simplicity
that
look
of
being
committed
to
nothing
in
particular
of
standing
in
an
attitude
of
general
hospitality
to
the
chances
of
life
of
being
very
much
at
one
s
own
disposal
so
characteristic
of
many
american
faces
it
was
our
friend
s
eye
that
chiefly
told
his
story
an
eye
in
which
innocence
and
experience
were
singularly
blended
it
was
full
of
contradictory
suggestions
and
though
it
was
by
no
means
the
glowing
orb
of
a
hero
of
romance
you
could
find
in
it
almost
anything
you
looked
for
frigid
and
yet
friendly
frank
yet
cautious
shrewd
yet
credulous
positive
yet
sceptical
confident
yet
shy
extremely
intelligent
and
extremely
there
was
something
vaguely
defiant
in
its
concessions
and
something
profoundly
reassuring
in
its
reserve
the
cut
of
this
gentleman
s
moustache
with
the
two
premature
wrinkles
in
the
cheek
above
it
and
the
fashion
of
his
garments
in
which
an
exposed
and
a
cerulean
cravat
played
perhaps
an
obtrusive
part
completed
the
conditions
of
his
identity
we
have
approached
him
perhaps
at
a
not
especially
favorable
moment
he
is
by
no
means
sitting
for
his
portrait
but
listless
as
he
lounges
there
rather
baffled
on
the
æsthetic
question
and
guilty
of
the
damning
fault
as
we
have
lately
discovered
it
to
be
of
confounding
the
merit
of
the
artist
with
that
of
his
work
for
he
admires
the
squinting
madonna
of
the
young
lady
with
the
boyish
coiffure
because
he
thinks
the
young
lady
herself
uncommonly
taking
he
is
a
sufficiently
promising
acquaintance
decision
salubrity
jocosity
prosperity
seem
to
hover
within
his
call
he
is
evidently
a
practical
man
but
the
idea
in
his
case
has
undefined
and
mysterious
boundaries
which
invite
the
imagination
to
bestir
itself
on
his
behalf
as
the
little
copyist
proceeded
with
her
work
she
sent
every
now
and
then
a
responsive
glance
toward
her
admirer
the
cultivation
of
the
fine
arts
appeared
to
necessitate
to
her
mind
a
great
deal
of
a
great
standing
off
with
folded
arms
and
head
drooping
from
side
to
side
stroking
of
a
dimpled
chin
with
a
dimpled
hand
sighing
and
frowning
and
patting
of
the
foot
fumbling
in
disordered
tresses
for
wandering
these
performances
were
accompanied
by
a
restless
glance
which
lingered
longer
than
elsewhere
upon
the
gentleman
we
have
described
at
last
he
rose
abruptly
put
on
his
hat
and
approached
the
young
lady
he
placed
himself
before
her
picture
and
looked
at
it
for
some
moments
during
which
she
pretended
to
be
quite
unconscious
of
his
inspection
then
addressing
her
with
the
single
word
which
constituted
the
strength
of
his
french
vocabulary
and
holding
up
one
finger
in
a
manner
which
appeared
to
him
to
illuminate
his
meaning
he
abruptly
demanded
the
artist
stared
a
moment
gave
a
little
pout
shrugged
her
shoulders
put
down
her
palette
and
brushes
and
stood
rubbing
her
hands
how
much
said
our
friend
in
english
monsieur
wishes
to
buy
it
asked
the
young
lady
in
french
very
pretty
combien
repeated
the
american
it
pleases
monsieur
my
little
picture
it
s
a
very
beautiful
subject
said
the
young
lady
the
madonna
yes
i
am
not
a
catholic
but
i
want
to
buy
it
write
it
and
he
took
a
pencil
from
his
pocket
and
showed
her
the
of
his
she
stood
looking
at
him
and
scratching
her
chin
with
the
pencil
is
it
not
for
sale
he
asked
and
as
she
still
stood
reflecting
and
looking
at
him
with
an
eye
which
in
spite
of
her
desire
to
treat
this
avidity
of
patronage
as
a
very
old
story
betrayed
an
almost
touching
incredulity
he
was
afraid
he
had
offended
her
she
was
simply
trying
to
look
indifferent
and
wondering
how
far
she
might
go
i
haven
t
made
a
mistake
no
her
interlocutor
continued
don
t
you
understand
a
little
english
the
young
lady
s
aptitude
for
playing
a
part
at
short
notice
was
remarkable
she
fixed
him
with
her
conscious
perceptive
eye
and
asked
him
if
he
spoke
no
french
then
she
said
briefly
and
took
the
open
in
the
upper
corner
of
the
she
traced
a
number
in
a
minute
and
extremely
neat
hand
then
she
handed
back
the
book
and
took
up
her
palette
again
our
friend
read
the
number
he
said
nothing
for
a
time
but
stood
looking
at
the
picture
while
the
copyist
began
actively
to
dabble
with
her
paint
for
a
copy
isn
t
that
a
good
deal
he
asked
at
last
beaucoup
the
young
lady
raised
her
eyes
from
her
palette
scanned
him
from
head
to
foot
and
alighted
with
admirable
sagacity
upon
exactly
the
right
answer
yes
it
s
a
good
deal
but
my
copy
has
remarkable
qualities
it
is
worth
nothing
the
gentleman
in
whom
we
are
interested
understood
no
french
but
i
have
said
he
was
intelligent
and
here
is
a
good
chance
to
prove
it
he
apprehended
by
a
natural
instinct
the
meaning
of
the
young
woman
s
phrase
and
it
gratified
him
to
think
that
she
was
so
honest
beauty
talent
virtue
she
combined
everything
but
you
must
finish
it
he
said
you
know
and
he
pointed
to
the
unpainted
hand
of
the
figure
oh
it
shall
be
finished
in
perfection
in
the
perfection
of
perfections
cried
mademoiselle
and
to
confirm
her
promise
she
deposited
a
rosy
blotch
in
the
middle
of
the
madonna
s
cheek
but
the
american
frowned
ah
too
red
too
red
he
rejoined
her
complexion
pointing
to
the
murillo
is
more
delicate
oh
it
shall
be
delicate
monsieur
delicate
as
sèvres
i
am
going
to
tone
that
down
i
know
all
the
secrets
of
my
art
and
where
will
you
allow
us
to
send
it
to
you
your
address
my
address
oh
yes
and
the
gentleman
drew
a
card
from
his
and
wrote
something
upon
it
then
hesitating
a
moment
he
said
if
i
don
t
like
it
when
it
it
s
finished
you
know
i
shall
not
be
obliged
to
take
the
young
lady
seemed
as
good
a
guesser
as
himself
oh
i
am
very
sure
that
monsieur
is
not
capricious
she
said
with
a
roguish
smile
capricious
and
at
this
monsieur
began
to
laugh
oh
no
i
m
not
capricious
i
am
very
faithful
i
am
very
constant
monsieur
is
constant
i
understand
perfectly
it
s
a
rare
virtue
to
recompense
you
you
shall
have
your
picture
on
the
first
possible
day
next
week
as
soon
as
it
is
dry
i
will
take
the
card
of
and
she
took
it
and
read
his
name
christopher
then
she
tried
to
repeat
it
aloud
and
laughed
at
her
bad
accent
your
english
names
are
so
droll
droll
said
newman
laughing
too
did
you
ever
hear
of
christopher
columbus
sûr
he
invented
america
a
very
great
man
and
is
he
your
patron
my
patron
your
in
the
oh
exactly
my
parents
named
me
for
monsieur
is
american
don
t
you
see
it
monsieur
inquired
and
you
mean
to
carry
my
little
picture
away
over
there
and
she
explained
her
phrase
with
a
gesture
oh
i
mean
to
buy
a
great
many
pictures
said
christopher
newman
the
honor
is
not
less
for
me
the
young
lady
answered
for
i
am
sure
monsieur
has
a
great
deal
of
but
you
must
give
me
your
card
newman
said
your
card
you
the
young
lady
looked
severe
for
an
instant
and
then
said
my
father
will
wait
upon
but
this
time
newman
s
powers
of
divination
were
at
fault
your
card
your
address
he
simply
repeated
my
address
said
mademoiselle
then
with
a
little
shrug
happily
for
you
you
are
an
american
it
is
the
first
time
i
ever
gave
my
card
to
a
and
taking
from
her
pocket
a
rather
greasy
portemonnaie
she
extracted
from
it
a
small
glazed
visiting
card
and
presented
the
latter
to
her
patron
it
was
neatly
inscribed
in
pencil
with
a
great
many
flourishes
mlle
noémie
but
newman
unlike
his
companion
read
the
name
with
perfect
gravity
all
french
names
to
him
were
equally
droll
and
precisely
here
is
my
father
who
has
come
to
escort
me
home
said
mademoiselle
noémie
he
speaks
english
he
will
arrange
with
and
she
turned
to
welcome
a
little
old
gentleman
who
came
shuffling
up
peering
over
his
spectacles
at
newman
nioche
wore
a
glossy
wig
of
an
unnatural
color
which
overhung
his
little
meek
white
vacant
face
and
left
it
hardly
more
expressive
than
the
unfeatured
block
upon
which
these
articles
are
displayed
in
the
barber
s
window
he
was
an
exquisite
image
of
shabby
gentility
his
scant
coat
desperately
brushed
his
darned
gloves
his
highly
polished
boots
his
rusty
shapely
hat
told
the
story
of
a
person
who
had
had
losses
and
who
clung
to
the
spirit
of
nice
habits
even
though
the
letter
had
been
hopelessly
effaced
among
other
things
nioche
had
lost
courage
adversity
had
not
only
ruined
him
it
had
frightened
him
and
he
was
evidently
going
through
his
remnant
of
life
on
tiptoe
for
fear
of
waking
up
the
hostile
fates
if
this
strange
gentleman
was
saying
anything
improper
to
his
daughter
nioche
would
entreat
him
huskily
as
a
particular
favor
to
forbear
but
he
would
admit
at
the
same
time
that
he
was
very
presumptuous
to
ask
for
particular
favors
monsieur
has
bought
my
picture
said
mademoiselle
noémie
when
it
s
finished
you
ll
carry
it
to
him
in
a
in
a
cab
cried
nioche
and
he
stared
in
a
bewildered
way
as
if
he
had
seen
the
sun
rising
at
midnight
are
you
the
young
lady
s
father
said
newman
i
think
she
said
you
speak
speak
english
yes
said
the
old
man
slowly
rubbing
his
hands
i
will
bring
it
in
a
say
something
then
cried
his
daughter
thank
him
a
little
not
too
a
little
my
daughter
a
little
said
nioche
perplexed
how
much
two
thousand
said
mademoiselle
noémie
don
t
make
a
fuss
or
he
ll
take
back
his
two
thousand
cried
the
old
man
and
he
began
to
fumble
for
his
he
looked
at
newman
from
head
to
foot
he
looked
at
his
daughter
and
then
at
the
picture
take
care
you
don
t
spoil
it
he
cried
almost
sublimely
we
must
go
home
said
mademoiselle
noémie
this
is
a
good
day
s
work
take
care
how
you
carry
it
and
she
began
to
put
up
her
utensils
how
can
i
thank
you
said
nioche
my
english
does
not
i
wish
i
spoke
french
as
well
said
newman
your
daughter
is
very
oh
sir
and
nioche
looked
over
his
spectacles
with
tearful
eyes
and
nodded
several
times
with
a
world
of
sadness
she
has
had
an
education
nothing
was
spared
lessons
in
pastel
at
ten
francs
the
lesson
lessons
in
oil
at
twelve
francs
i
didn
t
look
at
the
francs
then
she
s
an
eh
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
you
have
had
reverses
asked
newman
reverses
oh
sir
misfortunes
unsuccessful
in
business
eh
very
unsuccessful
oh
never
fear
you
ll
get
on
your
legs
again
said
newman
cheerily
the
old
man
drooped
his
head
on
one
side
and
looked
at
him
with
an
expression
of
pain
as
if
this
were
an
unfeeling
jest
what
does
he
say
demanded
mademoiselle
noémie
nioche
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
he
says
i
will
make
my
fortune
perhaps
he
will
help
you
and
what
else
he
says
thou
art
very
it
is
very
possible
you
believe
it
yourself
my
father
believe
it
my
daughter
with
this
evidence
and
the
old
man
turned
afresh
with
a
staring
wondering
homage
to
the
audacious
daub
on
the
easel
ask
him
then
if
he
would
not
like
to
learn
to
learn
french
to
take
to
take
lessons
my
daughter
from
thee
from
you
from
me
my
child
how
should
i
give
lessons
de
raisons
ask
him
immediately
said
mademoiselle
noémie
with
soft
brevity
nioche
stood
aghast
but
under
his
daughter
s
eye
he
collected
his
wits
and
doing
his
best
to
assume
an
agreeable
smile
he
executed
her
commands
would
it
please
you
to
receive
instruction
in
our
beautiful
language
he
inquired
with
an
appealing
quaver
to
study
french
asked
newman
staring
nioche
pressed
his
together
and
slowly
raised
his
shoulders
a
little
conversation
conversation
that
s
it
murmured
mademoiselle
noémie
who
had
caught
the
word
the
conversation
of
the
best
our
french
conversation
is
famous
you
know
nioche
ventured
to
continue
it
s
a
great
but
isn
t
it
awfully
difficult
asked
newman
very
simply
not
to
a
man
of
like
monsieur
an
admirer
of
beauty
in
every
form
and
nioche
cast
a
significant
glance
at
his
daughter
s
madonna
i
can
t
fancy
myself
chattering
french
said
newman
with
a
laugh
and
yet
i
suppose
that
the
more
a
man
knows
the
monsieur
expresses
that
very
happily
oui
i
suppose
it
would
help
me
a
great
deal
knocking
about
paris
to
know
the
ah
there
are
so
many
things
monsieur
must
want
to
say
difficult
things
everything
i
want
to
say
is
difficult
but
you
give
lessons
poor
nioche
was
embarrassed
he
smiled
more
appealingly
i
am
not
a
regular
professor
he
admitted
i
can
t
nevertheless
tell
him
that
i
m
a
professor
he
said
to
his
daughter
tell
him
it
s
a
very
exceptional
chance
answered
mademoiselle
noémie
an
du
one
gentleman
conversing
with
another
remember
what
you
are
what
you
have
been
a
teacher
of
languages
in
neither
case
much
more
formerly
and
much
less
and
if
he
asks
the
price
of
the
lessons
he
won
t
ask
it
said
mademoiselle
noémie
what
he
pleases
i
may
say
never
that
s
bad
if
he
asks
then
mademoiselle
noémie
had
put
on
her
bonnet
and
was
tying
the
ribbons
she
smoothed
them
out
with
her
soft
little
chin
thrust
forward
ten
francs
she
said
quickly
oh
my
daughter
i
shall
never
don
t
dare
then
he
won
t
ask
till
the
end
of
the
lessons
and
then
i
will
make
out
the
nioche
turned
to
the
confiding
foreigner
again
and
stood
rubbing
his
hands
with
an
air
of
seeming
to
plead
guilty
which
was
not
intenser
only
because
it
was
habitually
so
striking
it
never
occurred
to
newman
to
ask
him
for
a
guarantee
of
his
skill
in
imparting
instruction
he
supposed
of
course
nioche
knew
his
own
language
and
his
appealing
forlornness
was
quite
the
perfection
of
what
the
american
for
vague
reasons
had
always
associated
with
all
elderly
foreigners
of
the
class
newman
had
never
reflected
upon
philological
processes
his
chief
impression
with
regard
to
ascertaining
those
mysterious
correlatives
of
his
familiar
english
vocables
which
were
current
in
this
extraordinary
city
of
paris
was
that
it
was
simply
a
matter
of
a
good
deal
of
unwonted
and
rather
ridiculous
muscular
effort
on
his
own
part
how
did
you
learn
english
he
asked
of
the
old
man
when
i
was
young
before
my
miseries
oh
i
was
wide
awake
then
my
father
was
a
great
he
placed
me
for
a
year
in
a
in
england
some
of
it
stuck
to
me
but
much
i
have
forgotten
how
much
french
can
i
learn
in
a
month
what
does
he
say
asked
mademoiselle
noémie
nioche
explained
he
will
speak
like
an
angel
said
his
daughter
but
the
native
integrity
which
had
been
vainly
exerted
to
secure
nioche
s
commercial
prosperity
flickered
up
again
monsieur
he
answered
all
i
can
teach
you
and
then
recovering
himself
at
a
sign
from
his
daughter
i
will
wait
upon
you
at
your
oh
yes
i
should
like
to
learn
french
newman
went
on
with
democratic
confidingness
hang
me
if
i
should
ever
have
thought
of
it
i
took
for
granted
it
was
impossible
but
if
you
learned
my
language
why
shouldn
t
i
learn
yours
and
his
frank
friendly
laugh
drew
the
sting
from
the
jest
only
if
we
are
going
to
converse
you
know
you
must
think
of
something
cheerful
to
converse
you
are
very
good
sir
i
am
overcome
said
nioche
throwing
out
his
hands
but
you
have
cheerfulness
and
happiness
for
two
oh
no
said
newman
more
seriously
you
must
be
bright
and
lively
that
s
part
of
the
nioche
bowed
with
his
hand
on
his
heart
very
well
sir
you
have
already
made
me
come
and
bring
me
my
picture
then
i
will
pay
you
for
it
and
we
will
talk
about
that
that
will
be
a
cheerful
subject
mademoiselle
noémie
had
collected
her
accessories
and
she
gave
the
precious
madonna
in
charge
to
her
father
who
retreated
backwards
out
of
sight
holding
it
at
arm
and
reiterating
his
obeisance
the
young
lady
gathered
her
shawl
about
her
like
a
perfect
parisienne
and
it
was
with
the
smile
of
a
parisienne
that
she
took
leave
of
her
patron
chapter
ii
he
wandered
back
to
the
divan
and
seated
himself
on
the
other
side
in
view
of
the
great
canvas
on
which
paul
veronese
had
depicted
the
of
cana
wearied
as
he
was
he
found
the
picture
entertaining
it
had
an
illusion
for
him
it
satisfied
his
conception
which
was
ambitious
of
what
a
splendid
banquet
should
be
in
the
corner
of
the
picture
is
a
young
woman
with
yellow
tresses
confined
in
a
golden
she
is
bending
forward
and
listening
with
the
smile
of
a
charming
woman
at
a
to
her
neighbor
newman
detected
her
in
the
crowd
admired
her
and
perceived
that
she
too
had
her
votive
copyist
a
young
man
with
his
hair
standing
on
end
suddenly
he
became
conscious
of
the
germ
of
the
mania
of
the
collector
he
had
taken
the
first
step
why
should
he
not
go
on
it
was
only
twenty
minutes
before
that
he
had
bought
the
first
picture
of
his
life
and
now
he
was
already
thinking
of
as
a
fascinating
pursuit
his
reflections
quickened
his
and
he
was
on
the
point
of
approaching
the
young
man
with
another
two
or
three
facts
in
this
relation
are
noticeable
although
the
logical
chain
which
connects
them
may
seem
imperfect
he
knew
mademoiselle
nioche
had
asked
too
much
he
bore
her
no
grudge
for
doing
so
and
he
was
determined
to
pay
the
young
man
exactly
the
proper
sum
at
this
moment
however
his
attention
was
attracted
by
a
gentleman
who
had
come
from
another
part
of
the
room
and
whose
manner
was
that
of
a
stranger
to
the
gallery
although
he
was
equipped
with
neither
nor
he
carried
a
white
lined
with
blue
silk
and
he
strolled
in
front
of
the
paul
veronese
vaguely
looking
at
it
but
much
too
near
to
see
anything
but
the
grain
of
the
canvas
opposite
to
christopher
newman
he
paused
and
turned
and
then
our
friend
who
had
been
observing
him
had
a
chance
to
verify
a
suspicion
aroused
by
an
imperfect
view
of
his
face
the
result
of
this
larger
scrutiny
was
that
he
presently
sprang
to
his
feet
strode
across
the
room
and
with
an
outstretched
hand
arrested
the
gentleman
with
the
umbrella
the
latter
stared
but
put
out
his
hand
at
a
venture
he
was
corpulent
and
rosy
and
though
his
countenance
which
was
ornamented
with
a
beautiful
flaxen
beard
carefully
divided
in
the
middle
and
brushed
outward
at
the
sides
was
not
remarkable
for
intensity
of
expression
he
looked
like
a
person
who
would
willingly
shake
hands
with
anyone
i
know
not
what
newman
thought
of
his
face
but
he
found
a
want
of
response
in
his
grasp
oh
come
come
he
said
laughing
don
t
say
now
you
don
t
know
me
if
i
have
got
a
white
parasol
the
sound
of
his
voice
quickened
the
other
s
memory
his
face
expanded
to
its
fullest
capacity
and
he
also
broke
into
a
laugh
why
newman
i
ll
be
blowed
where
in
the
world
i
declare
who
would
have
thought
you
know
you
have
you
haven
t
said
newman
not
for
the
better
no
doubt
when
did
you
get
here
three
days
why
didn
t
you
let
me
know
i
had
no
idea
were
i
have
been
here
these
six
it
must
be
eight
or
nine
since
we
something
of
that
sort
we
were
very
it
was
in
louis
during
the
war
you
were
in
the
oh
no
not
i
but
you
i
believe
i
you
came
out
all
right
i
came
out
with
my
legs
and
arms
and
with
satisfaction
all
that
seems
very
far
and
how
long
have
you
been
in
europe
seventeen
first
time
yes
very
much
made
your
everlasting
fortune
christopher
newman
was
silent
a
moment
and
then
with
a
tranquil
smile
he
answered
and
come
to
paris
to
spend
it
eh
well
we
shall
see
so
they
carry
those
parasols
here
the
of
course
they
do
they
re
great
things
they
understand
comfort
out
where
do
you
buy
them
anywhere
well
tristram
i
m
glad
to
get
hold
of
you
you
can
show
me
the
ropes
i
suppose
you
know
paris
inside
tristram
gave
a
mellow
smile
of
well
i
guess
there
are
not
many
men
that
can
show
me
much
i
ll
take
care
of
it
s
a
pity
you
were
not
here
a
few
minutes
ago
i
have
just
bought
a
picture
you
might
have
put
the
thing
through
for
bought
a
picture
said
tristram
looking
vaguely
round
at
the
walls
why
do
they
sell
them
i
mean
a
oh
i
see
these
said
tristram
nodding
at
the
titians
and
vandykes
these
i
suppose
are
i
hope
so
cried
newman
i
don
t
want
a
copy
of
a
ah
said
tristram
mysteriously
you
can
never
tell
they
imitate
you
know
so
deucedly
well
it
s
like
the
jewellers
with
their
false
stones
go
into
the
palais
royal
there
you
see
imitation
on
half
the
windows
the
law
obliges
them
to
stick
it
on
you
know
but
you
can
t
tell
the
things
apart
to
tell
the
truth
tristram
continued
with
a
wry
face
i
don
t
do
much
in
pictures
i
leave
that
to
my
ah
you
have
got
a
wife
didn
t
i
mention
it
she
s
a
very
nice
woman
you
must
know
her
she
s
up
there
in
the
avenue
d
so
you
are
regularly
fixed
house
and
children
and
yes
a
house
and
a
couple
of
well
said
christopher
newman
stretching
his
arms
a
little
with
a
sigh
i
envy
oh
no
you
don
t
answered
tristram
giving
him
a
little
poke
with
his
parasol
i
beg
your
pardon
i
do
well
you
won
t
then
when
when
you
don
t
certainly
mean
when
i
have
seen
your
establishment
when
you
have
seen
paris
my
boy
you
want
to
be
your
own
master
oh
i
have
been
my
own
master
all
my
life
and
i
m
tired
of
well
try
paris
how
old
are
you
est
le
bel
as
they
say
what
does
that
mean
it
means
that
a
man
shouldn
t
send
away
his
plate
till
he
has
eaten
his
all
that
i
have
just
made
arrangements
to
take
french
oh
you
don
t
want
any
lessons
you
ll
pick
it
up
i
never
took
i
suppose
you
speak
french
as
well
as
english
better
said
tristram
roundly
it
s
a
splendid
language
you
can
say
all
sorts
of
bright
things
in
but
i
suppose
said
christopher
newman
with
an
earnest
desire
for
information
that
you
must
be
bright
to
begin
not
a
bit
that
s
just
the
beauty
of
the
two
friends
as
they
exchanged
these
remarks
had
remained
standing
where
they
met
and
leaning
against
the
rail
which
protected
the
pictures
tristram
at
last
declared
that
he
was
overcome
with
fatigue
and
should
be
happy
to
sit
down
newman
recommended
in
the
highest
terms
the
great
divan
on
which
he
had
been
lounging
and
they
prepared
to
seat
themselves
this
is
a
great
place
isn
t
it
said
newman
with
ardor
great
place
great
place
finest
thing
in
the
and
then
suddenly
tristram
hesitated
and
looked
about
him
i
suppose
they
won
t
let
you
smoke
newman
stared
smoke
i
m
sure
i
don
t
know
you
know
the
regulations
better
than
i
i
never
was
here
before
never
in
six
years
i
believe
my
wife
dragged
me
here
once
when
we
first
came
to
paris
but
i
never
found
my
way
but
you
say
you
know
paris
so
well
i
don
t
call
this
paris
cried
tristram
with
assurance
come
let
s
go
over
to
the
palais
royal
and
have
a
i
don
t
smoke
said
newman
a
drink
and
tristram
led
his
companion
away
they
passed
through
the
glorious
halls
of
the
louvre
down
the
staircases
along
the
cool
dim
galleries
of
sculpture
and
out
into
the
enormous
court
newman
looked
about
him
as
he
went
but
he
made
no
comments
and
it
was
only
when
they
at
last
emerged
into
the
open
air
that
he
said
to
his
friend
it
seems
to
me
that
in
your
place
i
should
have
come
here
once
a
oh
no
you
wouldn
t
said
tristram
you
think
so
but
you
wouldn
t
you
wouldn
t
have
had
time
you
would
always
mean
to
go
but
you
never
would
go
there
s
better
fun
than
that
here
in
paris
italy
s
the
place
to
see
pictures
wait
till
you
get
there
there
you
have
to
go
you
can
t
do
anything
else
it
s
an
awful
country
you
can
t
get
a
decent
cigar
i
don
t
know
why
i
went
in
there
i
was
strolling
along
rather
hard
up
for
amusement
i
sort
of
noticed
the
louvre
as
i
passed
and
i
thought
i
would
go
in
and
see
what
was
going
on
but
if
i
hadn
t
found
you
there
i
should
have
felt
rather
sold
hang
it
i
don
t
care
for
pictures
i
prefer
the
reality
and
tristram
tossed
off
this
happy
formula
with
an
assurance
which
the
numerous
class
of
persons
suffering
from
an
overdose
of
culture
might
have
envied
him
the
two
gentlemen
proceeded
along
the
rue
de
rivoli
and
into
the
palais
royal
where
they
seated
themselves
at
one
of
the
little
tables
stationed
at
the
door
of
the
café
which
projects
into
the
great
open
quadrangle
the
place
was
filled
with
people
the
fountains
were
spouting
a
band
was
playing
clusters
of
chairs
were
gathered
beneath
all
the
and
buxom
nurses
seated
along
the
benches
were
offering
to
their
infant
charges
the
amplest
facilities
for
nutrition
there
was
an
easy
homely
gaiety
in
the
whole
scene
and
christopher
newman
felt
that
it
was
most
characteristically
parisian
and
now
began
tristram
when
they
had
tested
the
decoction
which
he
had
caused
to
be
served
to
them
now
just
give
an
account
of
yourself
what
are
your
ideas
what
are
your
plans
where
have
you
come
from
and
where
are
you
going
in
the
first
place
where
are
you
staying
at
the
grand
hotel
said
newman
tristram
puckered
his
plump
visage
that
won
t
do
you
must
change
demanded
newman
why
it
s
the
finest
hotel
i
ever
was
you
don
t
want
a
fine
hotel
you
want
something
small
and
quiet
and
elegant
where
your
bell
is
answered
and
you
your
person
is
they
keep
running
to
see
if
i
have
rung
before
i
have
touched
the
bell
said
newman
and
as
for
my
person
they
are
always
bowing
and
scraping
to
i
suppose
you
are
always
tipping
them
that
s
very
bad
always
by
no
means
a
man
brought
me
something
yesterday
and
then
stood
loafing
in
a
beggarly
manner
i
offered
him
a
chair
and
asked
him
if
he
wouldn
t
sit
down
was
that
bad
style
very
but
he
bolted
instantly
at
any
rate
the
place
amuses
me
hang
your
elegance
if
it
bores
me
i
sat
in
the
court
of
the
grand
hotel
last
night
until
two
o
clock
in
the
morning
watching
the
coming
and
going
and
the
people
knocking
you
re
easily
pleased
but
you
can
do
as
you
choose
a
man
in
your
shoes
you
have
made
a
pile
of
money
eh
i
have
made
happy
the
man
who
can
say
that
enough
for
what
enough
to
rest
awhile
to
forget
the
confounded
thing
to
look
about
me
to
see
the
world
to
have
a
good
time
to
improve
my
mind
and
if
the
fancy
takes
me
to
marry
a
newman
spoke
slowly
with
a
certain
dryness
of
accent
and
with
frequent
pauses
this
was
his
habitual
mode
of
utterance
but
it
was
especially
marked
in
the
words
i
have
just
quoted
jupiter
there
s
a
programme
cried
tristram
certainly
all
that
takes
money
especially
the
wife
unless
indeed
she
gives
it
as
mine
did
and
what
s
the
story
how
have
you
done
it
newman
had
pushed
his
hat
back
from
his
forehead
folded
his
arms
and
stretched
his
legs
he
listened
to
the
music
he
looked
about
him
at
the
bustling
crowd
at
the
plashing
fountains
at
the
nurses
and
the
babies
i
have
worked
he
answered
at
last
tristram
looked
at
him
for
some
moments
and
allowed
his
placid
eyes
to
measure
his
friend
s
generous
longitude
and
rest
upon
his
comfortably
contemplative
face
what
have
you
worked
at
he
asked
oh
at
several
i
suppose
you
re
a
smart
fellow
eh
newman
continued
to
look
at
the
nurses
and
babies
they
imparted
to
the
scene
a
kind
of
primordial
pastoral
simplicity
yes
he
said
at
last
i
suppose
i
and
then
in
answer
to
his
companion
s
inquiries
he
related
briefly
his
history
since
their
last
meeting
it
was
an
intensely
western
story
and
it
dealt
with
enterprises
which
it
will
be
needless
to
introduce
to
the
reader
in
detail
newman
had
come
out
of
the
war
with
a
brevet
of
an
honor
which
in
this
case
without
invidious
comparisons
had
lighted
upon
shoulders
amply
competent
to
bear
it
but
though
he
could
manage
a
fight
when
need
was
newman
heartily
disliked
the
business
his
four
years
in
the
army
had
left
him
with
an
angry
bitter
sense
of
the
waste
of
precious
things
life
and
time
and
money
and
smartness
and
the
early
freshness
of
purpose
and
he
had
addressed
himself
to
the
pursuits
of
peace
with
passionate
zest
and
energy
he
was
of
course
as
penniless
when
he
plucked
off
his
as
when
he
put
them
on
and
the
only
capital
at
his
disposal
was
his
dogged
resolution
and
his
lively
perception
of
ends
and
means
exertion
and
action
were
as
natural
to
him
as
respiration
a
more
completely
healthy
mortal
had
never
trod
the
elastic
soil
of
the
west
his
experience
moreover
was
as
wide
as
his
capacity
when
he
was
fourteen
years
old
necessity
had
taken
him
by
his
slim
young
shoulders
and
pushed
him
into
the
street
to
earn
that
night
s
supper
he
had
not
earned
it
but
he
had
earned
the
next
night
s
and
afterwards
whenever
he
had
had
none
it
was
because
he
had
gone
without
it
to
use
the
money
for
something
else
a
keener
pleasure
or
a
finer
profit
he
had
turned
his
hand
with
his
brain
in
it
to
many
things
he
had
been
enterprising
in
an
eminent
sense
of
the
term
he
had
been
adventurous
and
even
reckless
and
he
had
known
bitter
failure
as
well
as
brilliant
success
but
he
was
a
born
experimentalist
and
he
had
always
found
something
to
enjoy
in
the
pressure
of
necessity
even
when
it
was
as
irritating
as
the
haircloth
shirt
of
the
mediæval
monk
at
one
time
failure
seemed
inexorably
his
portion
became
his
and
whatever
he
touched
he
turned
not
to
gold
but
to
ashes
his
most
vivid
conception
of
a
supernatural
element
in
the
world
s
affairs
had
come
to
him
once
when
this
pertinacity
of
misfortune
was
at
its
climax
there
seemed
to
him
something
stronger
in
life
than
his
own
will
but
the
mysterious
something
could
only
be
the
devil
and
he
was
accordingly
seized
with
an
intense
personal
enmity
to
this
impertinent
force
he
had
known
what
it
was
to
have
utterly
exhausted
his
credit
to
be
unable
to
raise
a
dollar
and
to
find
himself
at
nightfall
in
a
strange
city
without
a
penny
to
mitigate
its
strangeness
it
was
under
these
circumstances
that
he
made
his
entrance
into
san
francisco
the
scene
subsequently
of
his
happiest
strokes
of
fortune
if
he
did
not
like
franklin
in
philadelphia
march
along
the
street
munching
a
it
was
only
because
he
had
not
the
necessary
to
the
performance
in
his
darkest
days
he
had
had
but
one
simple
practical
impulse
the
desire
as
he
would
have
phrased
it
to
see
the
thing
through
he
did
so
at
last
buffeted
his
way
into
smooth
waters
and
made
money
largely
it
must
be
admitted
rather
nakedly
that
christopher
newman
s
sole
aim
in
life
had
been
to
make
money
what
he
had
been
placed
in
the
world
for
was
to
his
own
perception
simply
to
wrest
a
fortune
the
bigger
the
better
from
defiant
opportunity
this
idea
completely
filled
his
horizon
and
satisfied
his
imagination
upon
the
uses
of
money
upon
what
one
might
do
with
a
life
into
which
one
had
succeeded
in
injecting
the
golden
stream
he
had
up
to
his
year
very
scantily
reflected
life
had
been
for
him
an
open
game
and
he
had
played
for
high
stakes
he
had
won
at
last
and
carried
off
his
winnings
and
now
what
was
he
to
do
with
them
he
was
a
man
to
whom
sooner
or
later
the
question
was
sure
to
present
itself
and
the
answer
to
it
belongs
to
our
story
a
vague
sense
that
more
answers
were
possible
than
his
philosophy
had
hitherto
dreamt
of
had
already
taken
possession
of
him
and
it
seemed
softly
and
agreeably
to
deepen
as
he
lounged
in
this
brilliant
corner
of
paris
with
his
friend
i
must
confess
he
presently
went
on
that
here
i
don
t
feel
at
all
smart
my
remarkable
talents
seem
of
no
use
i
feel
as
simple
as
a
little
child
and
a
little
child
might
take
me
by
the
hand
and
lead
me
oh
i
ll
be
your
little
child
said
tristram
jovially
i
ll
take
you
by
the
hand
trust
yourself
to
i
am
a
good
worker
newman
continued
but
i
rather
think
i
am
a
poor
loafer
i
have
come
abroad
to
amuse
myself
but
i
doubt
whether
i
know
oh
that
s
easily
well
i
may
perhaps
learn
it
but
i
am
afraid
i
shall
never
do
it
by
rote
i
have
the
best
will
in
the
world
about
it
but
my
genius
doesn
t
lie
in
that
direction
as
a
loafer
i
shall
never
be
original
as
i
take
it
that
you
yes
said
tristram
i
suppose
i
am
original
like
all
those
immoral
pictures
in
the
besides
newman
continued
i
don
t
want
to
work
at
pleasure
any
more
than
i
played
at
work
i
want
to
take
it
easily
i
feel
deliciously
lazy
and
i
should
like
to
spend
six
months
as
i
am
now
sitting
under
a
tree
and
listening
to
a
band
there
s
only
one
thing
i
want
to
hear
some
good
music
and
pictures
lord
what
refined
tastes
you
are
what
my
wife
calls
intellectual
i
ain
t
a
bit
but
we
can
find
something
better
for
you
to
do
than
to
sit
under
a
tree
to
begin
with
you
must
come
to
the
what
club
the
occidental
you
will
see
all
the
americans
there
all
the
best
of
them
at
least
of
course
you
play
poker
oh
i
say
cried
newman
with
energy
you
are
not
going
to
lock
me
up
in
a
club
and
stick
me
down
at
a
i
haven
t
come
all
this
way
for
what
the
deuce
you
come
for
you
were
glad
enough
to
play
poker
in
louis
i
recollect
when
you
cleaned
me
i
have
come
to
see
europe
to
get
the
best
out
of
it
i
can
i
want
to
see
all
the
great
things
and
do
what
the
clever
people
the
clever
people
much
obliged
you
set
me
down
as
a
blockhead
then
newman
was
sitting
sidewise
in
his
chair
with
his
elbow
on
the
back
and
his
head
leaning
on
his
hand
without
moving
he
looked
a
while
at
his
companion
with
his
dry
guarded
and
yet
altogether
smile
introduce
me
to
your
wife
he
said
at
last
tristram
bounced
about
in
his
chair
upon
my
word
i
won
t
she
doesn
t
want
any
help
to
turn
up
her
nose
at
me
nor
do
you
either
i
don
t
turn
up
my
nose
at
you
my
dear
fellow
nor
at
anyone
or
anything
i
m
not
proud
i
assure
you
i
m
not
proud
that
s
why
i
am
willing
to
take
example
by
the
clever
well
if
i
m
not
the
rose
as
they
say
here
i
have
lived
near
it
i
can
show
you
some
clever
people
too
do
you
know
general
packard
do
you
know
hatch
do
you
know
miss
kitty
upjohn
i
shall
be
happy
to
make
their
acquaintance
i
want
to
cultivate
tristram
seemed
restless
and
suspicious
he
eyed
his
friend
askance
and
then
what
are
you
up
to
anyway
he
demanded
are
you
going
to
write
a
book
christopher
newman
twisted
one
end
of
his
moustache
a
while
in
silence
and
at
last
he
made
answer
one
day
a
couple
of
months
ago
something
very
curious
happened
to
me
i
had
come
on
to
new
york
on
some
important
business
it
was
rather
a
long
story
a
question
of
getting
ahead
of
another
party
in
a
certain
particular
way
in
the
this
other
party
had
once
played
me
a
very
mean
trick
i
owed
him
a
grudge
i
felt
awfully
savage
at
the
time
and
i
vowed
that
when
i
got
a
chance
i
would
figuratively
speaking
put
his
nose
out
of
joint
there
was
a
matter
of
some
sixty
thousand
dollars
at
stake
if
i
put
it
out
of
his
way
it
was
a
blow
the
fellow
would
feel
and
he
really
deserved
no
quarter
i
jumped
into
a
hack
and
went
about
my
business
and
it
was
in
this
hack
this
immortal
historical
hack
that
the
curious
thing
i
speak
of
occurred
it
was
a
hack
like
any
other
only
a
trifle
dirtier
with
a
greasy
line
along
the
top
of
the
drab
cushions
as
if
it
had
been
used
for
a
great
many
irish
funerals
it
is
possible
i
took
a
nap
i
had
been
traveling
all
night
and
though
i
was
excited
with
my
errand
i
felt
the
want
of
sleep
at
all
events
i
woke
up
suddenly
from
a
sleep
or
from
a
kind
of
a
reverie
with
the
most
extraordinary
feeling
in
the
world
a
mortal
disgust
for
the
thing
i
was
going
to
do
it
came
upon
me
like
and
he
snapped
his
fingers
as
abruptly
as
an
old
wound
that
begins
to
ache
i
couldn
t
tell
the
meaning
of
it
i
only
felt
that
i
loathed
the
whole
business
and
wanted
to
wash
my
hands
of
it
the
idea
of
losing
that
sixty
thousand
dollars
of
letting
it
utterly
slide
and
scuttle
and
never
hearing
of
it
again
seemed
the
sweetest
thing
in
the
world
and
all
this
took
place
quite
independently
of
my
will
and
i
sat
watching
it
as
if
it
were
a
play
at
the
theatre
i
could
feel
it
going
on
inside
of
me
you
may
depend
upon
it
that
there
are
things
going
on
inside
of
us
that
we
understand
mighty
little
jupiter
you
make
my
flesh
creep
cried
tristram
and
while
you
sat
in
your
hack
watching
the
play
as
you
call
it
the
other
man
marched
in
and
bagged
your
sixty
thousand
dollars
i
have
not
the
least
idea
i
hope
so
poor
devil
but
i
never
found
out
we
pulled
up
in
front
of
the
place
i
was
going
to
in
wall
street
but
i
sat
still
in
the
carriage
and
at
last
the
driver
scrambled
down
off
his
seat
to
see
whether
his
carriage
had
not
turned
into
a
hearse
i
couldn
t
have
got
out
any
more
than
if
i
had
been
a
corpse
what
was
the
matter
with
me
momentary
idiocy
you
ll
say
what
i
wanted
to
get
out
of
was
wall
street
i
told
the
man
to
drive
down
to
the
brooklyn
ferry
and
to
cross
over
when
we
were
over
i
told
him
to
drive
me
out
into
the
country
as
i
had
told
him
originally
to
drive
for
dear
life
down
town
i
suppose
he
thought
me
insane
perhaps
i
was
but
in
that
case
i
am
insane
still
i
spent
the
morning
looking
at
the
first
green
leaves
on
long
island
i
was
sick
of
business
i
wanted
to
throw
it
all
up
and
break
off
short
i
had
money
enough
or
if
i
hadn
t
i
ought
to
have
i
seemed
to
feel
a
new
man
inside
my
old
skin
and
i
longed
for
a
new
world
when
you
want
a
thing
so
very
badly
you
had
better
treat
yourself
to
it
i
didn
t
understand
the
matter
not
in
the
least
but
i
gave
the
old
horse
the
bridle
and
let
him
find
his
way
as
soon
as
i
could
get
out
of
the
game
i
sailed
for
europe
that
is
how
i
come
to
be
sitting
you
ought
to
have
bought
up
that
hack
said
tristram
it
isn
t
a
safe
vehicle
to
have
about
and
you
have
really
sold
out
then
you
have
retired
from
business
i
have
made
over
my
hand
to
a
friend
when
i
feel
disposed
i
can
take
up
the
cards
again
i
dare
say
that
a
twelvemonth
hence
the
operation
will
be
reversed
the
pendulum
will
swing
back
again
i
shall
be
sitting
in
a
gondola
or
on
a
dromedary
and
all
of
a
sudden
i
shall
want
to
clear
out
but
for
the
present
i
am
perfectly
free
i
have
even
bargained
that
i
am
to
receive
no
business
oh
it
s
a
real
de
said
tristram
i
back
out
a
poor
devil
like
me
can
t
help
you
to
spend
such
very
magnificent
leisure
as
that
you
should
get
introduced
to
the
crowned
newman
looked
at
him
a
moment
and
then
with
his
easy
smile
how
does
one
do
it
he
asked
come
i
like
that
cried
tristram
it
shows
you
are
in
of
course
i
am
in
earnest
didn
t
i
say
i
wanted
the
best
i
know
the
best
can
t
be
had
for
mere
money
but
i
rather
think
money
will
do
a
good
deal
in
addition
i
am
willing
to
take
a
good
deal
of
you
are
not
bashful
eh
i
haven
t
the
least
idea
i
want
the
biggest
kind
of
entertainment
a
man
can
get
people
places
art
nature
everything
i
want
to
see
the
tallest
mountains
and
the
bluest
lakes
and
the
finest
pictures
and
the
handsomest
churches
and
the
most
celebrated
men
and
the
most
beautiful
settle
down
in
paris
then
there
are

i
shall
have
to
introduce
you
to
my
wife
chapter
iii
he
performed
this
ceremony
on
the
following
day
when
by
appointment
christopher
newman
went
to
dine
with
him
and
tristram
lived
behind
one
of
those
façades
which
decorate
with
their
pompous
sameness
the
broad
avenues
manufactured
by
baron
haussmann
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
arc
de
triomphe
their
apartment
was
rich
in
the
modern
conveniences
and
tristram
lost
no
time
in
calling
his
visitor
s
attention
to
their
principal
household
treasures
the
and
the
whenever
you
feel
homesick
he
said
you
must
come
up
here
we
ll
stick
you
down
before
a
register
under
a
good
big
burner
and
and
you
will
soon
get
over
your
homesickness
said
tristram
her
husband
stared
his
wife
often
had
a
tone
which
he
found
inscrutable
he
could
not
tell
for
his
life
whether
she
was
in
jest
or
in
earnest
the
truth
is
that
circumstances
had
done
much
to
cultivate
in
tristram
a
marked
tendency
to
irony
her
taste
on
many
points
differed
from
that
of
her
husband
and
though
she
made
frequent
concessions
it
must
be
confessed
that
her
concessions
were
not
always
graceful
they
were
founded
upon
a
vague
project
she
had
of
some
day
doing
something
very
positive
something
a
trifle
passionate
what
she
meant
to
do
she
could
by
no
means
have
told
you
but
meanwhile
nevertheless
she
was
buying
a
good
conscience
by
instalments
it
should
be
added
without
delay
to
anticipate
misconception
that
her
little
scheme
of
independence
did
not
definitely
involve
the
assistance
of
another
person
of
the
opposite
sex
she
was
not
saving
up
virtue
to
cover
the
expenses
of
a
flirtation
for
this
there
were
various
reasons
to
begin
with
she
had
a
very
plain
face
and
she
was
entirely
without
illusions
as
to
her
appearance
she
had
taken
its
measure
to
a
hair
s
breadth
she
knew
the
worst
and
the
best
she
had
accepted
herself
it
had
not
been
indeed
without
a
struggle
as
a
young
girl
she
had
spent
hours
with
her
back
to
her
mirror
crying
her
eyes
out
and
later
she
had
from
desperation
and
bravado
adopted
the
habit
of
proclaiming
herself
the
most
of
women
in
order
that
she
might
as
in
common
politeness
was
inevitable
be
contradicted
and
reassured
it
was
since
she
had
come
to
live
in
europe
that
she
had
begun
to
take
the
matter
philosophically
her
observation
acutely
exercised
here
had
suggested
to
her
that
a
woman
s
first
duty
is
not
to
be
beautiful
but
to
be
pleasing
and
she
encountered
so
many
women
who
pleased
without
beauty
that
she
began
to
feel
that
she
had
discovered
her
mission
she
had
once
heard
an
enthusiastic
musician
out
of
patience
with
a
gifted
bungler
declare
that
a
fine
voice
is
really
an
obstacle
to
singing
properly
and
it
occurred
to
her
that
it
might
perhaps
be
equally
true
that
a
beautiful
face
is
an
obstacle
to
the
acquisition
of
charming
manners
tristram
then
undertook
to
be
exquisitely
agreeable
and
she
brought
to
the
task
a
really
touching
devotion
how
well
she
would
have
succeeded
i
am
unable
to
say
unfortunately
she
broke
off
in
the
middle
her
own
excuse
was
the
want
of
encouragement
in
her
immediate
circle
but
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
she
had
not
a
real
genius
for
the
matter
or
she
would
have
pursued
the
charming
art
for
itself
the
poor
lady
was
very
incomplete
she
fell
back
upon
the
harmonies
of
the
toilet
which
she
thoroughly
understood
and
contented
herself
with
dressing
in
perfection
she
lived
in
paris
which
she
pretended
to
detest
because
it
was
only
in
paris
that
one
could
find
things
to
exactly
suit
one
s
complexion
besides
out
of
paris
it
was
always
more
or
less
of
a
trouble
to
get
gloves
when
she
railed
at
this
serviceable
city
and
you
asked
her
where
she
would
prefer
to
reside
she
returned
some
very
unexpected
answer
she
would
say
in
copenhagen
or
in
barcelona
having
while
making
the
tour
of
europe
spent
a
couple
of
days
at
each
of
these
places
on
the
whole
with
her
poetic
furbelows
and
her
misshapen
intelligent
little
face
she
was
when
you
knew
her
a
decidedly
interesting
woman
she
was
naturally
shy
and
if
she
had
been
born
a
beauty
she
would
having
no
vanity
probably
have
remained
shy
now
she
was
both
diffident
and
importunate
extremely
reserved
sometimes
with
her
friends
and
strangely
expansive
with
strangers
she
despised
her
husband
despised
him
too
much
for
she
had
been
perfectly
at
liberty
not
to
marry
him
she
had
been
in
love
with
a
clever
man
who
had
slighted
her
and
she
had
married
a
fool
in
the
hope
that
this
thankless
wit
reflecting
on
it
would
conclude
that
she
had
no
appreciation
of
merit
and
that
he
had
flattered
himself
in
supposing
that
she
cared
for
his
own
restless
discontented
visionary
without
personal
ambitions
but
with
a
certain
avidity
of
imagination
she
was
as
i
have
said
before
eminently
incomplete
she
was
full
both
for
good
and
for
ill
of
beginnings
that
came
to
nothing
but
she
had
nevertheless
morally
a
spark
of
the
sacred
fire
newman
was
fond
under
all
circumstances
of
the
society
of
women
and
now
that
he
was
out
of
his
native
element
and
deprived
of
his
habitual
interests
he
turned
to
it
for
compensation
he
took
a
great
fancy
to
tristram
she
frankly
repaid
it
and
after
their
first
meeting
he
passed
a
great
many
hours
in
her
after
two
or
three
talks
they
were
fast
friends
newman
s
manner
with
women
was
peculiar
and
it
required
some
ingenuity
on
a
lady
s
part
to
discover
that
he
admired
her
he
had
no
gallantry
in
the
usual
sense
of
the
term
no
compliments
no
graces
no
speeches
very
fond
of
what
is
called
chaffing
in
his
dealings
with
men
he
never
found
himself
on
a
sofa
beside
a
member
of
the
softer
sex
without
feeling
extremely
serious
he
was
not
shy
and
so
far
as
awkwardness
proceeds
from
a
struggle
with
shyness
he
was
not
awkward
grave
attentive
submissive
often
silent
he
was
simply
swimming
in
a
sort
of
rapture
of
respect
this
emotion
was
not
at
all
theoretic
it
was
not
even
in
a
high
degree
sentimental
he
had
thought
very
little
about
the
position
of
women
and
he
was
not
familiar
either
sympathetically
or
otherwise
with
the
image
of
a
president
in
petticoats
his
attitude
was
simply
the
flower
of
his
general
and
a
part
of
his
instinctive
and
genuinely
democratic
assumption
of
everyone
s
right
to
lead
an
easy
life
if
a
shaggy
pauper
had
a
right
to
bed
and
board
and
wages
and
a
vote
women
of
course
who
were
weaker
than
paupers
and
whose
physical
tissue
was
in
itself
an
appeal
should
be
maintained
sentimentally
at
the
public
expense
newman
was
willing
to
be
taxed
for
this
purpose
largely
in
proportion
to
his
means
moreover
many
of
the
common
traditions
with
regard
to
women
were
with
him
fresh
personal
impressions
he
had
never
read
a
novel
he
had
been
struck
with
their
acuteness
their
subtlety
their
tact
their
felicity
of
judgment
they
seemed
to
him
exquisitely
organized
if
it
is
true
that
one
must
always
have
in
one
s
work
here
below
a
religion
or
at
least
an
ideal
of
some
sort
newman
found
his
metaphysical
inspiration
in
a
vague
acceptance
of
final
responsibility
to
some
illumined
feminine
brow
he
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
in
listening
to
advice
from
tristram
advice
it
must
be
added
for
which
he
had
never
asked
he
would
have
been
incapable
of
asking
for
it
for
he
had
no
perception
of
difficulties
and
consequently
no
curiosity
about
remedies
the
complex
parisian
world
about
him
seemed
a
very
simple
affair
it
was
an
immense
amazing
spectacle
but
it
neither
inflamed
his
imagination
nor
irritated
his
curiosity
he
kept
his
hands
in
his
pockets
looked
on
desired
to
miss
nothing
important
observed
a
great
many
things
narrowly
and
never
reverted
to
himself
tristram
s
advice
was
a
part
of
the
show
and
a
more
entertaining
element
in
her
abundant
gossip
than
the
others
he
enjoyed
her
talking
about
himself
it
seemed
a
part
of
her
beautiful
ingenuity
but
he
never
made
an
application
of
anything
she
said
or
remembered
it
when
he
was
away
from
her
for
herself
she
appropriated
him
he
was
the
most
interesting
thing
she
had
had
to
think
about
in
many
a
month
she
wished
to
do
something
with
him
she
hardly
knew
what
there
was
so
much
of
him
he
was
so
rich
and
robust
so
easy
friendly
that
he
kept
her
fancy
constantly
on
the
alert
for
the
present
the
only
thing
she
could
do
was
to
like
him
she
told
him
that
he
was
horribly
western
but
in
this
compliment
the
adverb
was
tinged
with
insincerity
she
led
him
about
with
her
introduced
him
to
fifty
people
and
took
extreme
satisfaction
in
her
conquest
newman
accepted
every
proposal
shook
hands
universally
and
promiscuously
and
seemed
equally
unfamiliar
with
trepidation
or
with
elation
tom
tristram
complained
of
his
wife
s
avidity
and
declared
that
he
could
never
have
a
clear
five
minutes
with
his
friend
if
he
had
known
how
things
were
going
to
turn
out
he
never
would
have
brought
him
to
the
avenue
d
iéna
the
two
men
formerly
had
not
been
intimate
but
newman
remembered
his
earlier
impression
of
his
host
and
did
tristram
who
had
by
no
means
taken
him
into
her
confidence
but
whose
secret
he
presently
discovered
the
justice
to
admit
that
her
husband
was
a
rather
degenerate
mortal
at
he
had
been
a
good
fellow
and
in
this
respect
he
was
unchanged
but
of
a
man
of
his
age
one
expected
something
more
people
said
he
was
sociable
but
this
was
as
much
a
matter
of
course
as
for
a
dipped
sponge
to
expand
and
it
was
not
a
high
order
of
sociability
he
was
a
great
gossip
and
tattler
and
to
produce
a
laugh
would
hardly
have
spared
the
reputation
of
his
aged
mother
newman
had
a
kindness
for
old
memories
but
he
found
it
impossible
not
to
perceive
that
tristram
was
nowadays
a
very
light
weight
his
only
aspirations
were
to
hold
out
at
poker
at
his
club
to
know
the
names
of
all
the
to
shake
hands
all
round
to
ply
his
rosy
gullet
with
truffles
and
champagne
and
to
create
uncomfortable
eddies
and
obstructions
among
the
constituent
atoms
of
the
american
colony
he
was
shamefully
idle
spiritless
sensual
snobbish
he
irritated
our
friend
by
the
tone
of
his
allusions
to
their
native
country
and
newman
was
at
a
loss
to
understand
why
the
united
states
were
not
good
enough
for
tristram
he
had
never
been
a
very
conscious
patriot
but
it
vexed
him
to
see
them
treated
as
little
better
than
a
vulgar
smell
in
his
friend
s
nostrils
and
he
finally
broke
out
and
swore
that
they
were
the
greatest
country
in
the
world
that
they
could
put
all
europe
into
their
breeches
pockets
and
that
an
american
who
spoke
ill
of
them
ought
to
be
carried
home
in
irons
and
compelled
to
live
in
boston
this
for
newman
was
putting
it
very
vindictively
tristram
was
a
comfortable
man
to
snub
he
bore
no
malice
and
he
continued
to
insist
on
newman
s
finishing
his
evening
at
the
occidental
club
christopher
newman
dined
several
times
in
the
avenue
d
iéna
and
his
host
always
proposed
an
early
adjournment
to
this
institution
tristram
protested
and
declared
that
her
husband
exhausted
his
ingenuity
in
trying
to
displease
her
oh
no
i
never
try
my
love
he
answered
i
know
you
loathe
me
quite
enough
when
i
take
my
newman
hated
to
see
a
husband
and
wife
on
these
terms
and
he
was
sure
one
or
other
of
them
must
be
very
unhappy
he
knew
it
was
not
tristram
tristram
had
a
balcony
before
her
windows
upon
which
during
the
june
evenings
she
was
fond
of
sitting
and
newman
used
frankly
to
say
that
he
preferred
the
balcony
to
the
club
it
had
a
fringe
of
perfumed
plants
in
tubs
and
enabled
you
to
look
up
the
broad
street
and
see
the
arch
of
triumph
vaguely
massing
its
heroic
sculptures
in
the
summer
starlight
sometimes
newman
kept
his
promise
of
following
tristram
in
half
an
hour
to
the
occidental
and
sometimes
he
forgot
it
his
hostess
asked
him
a
great
many
questions
about
himself
but
on
this
subject
he
was
an
indifferent
talker
he
was
not
what
is
called
subjective
though
when
he
felt
that
her
interest
was
sincere
he
made
an
almost
heroic
attempt
to
be
he
told
her
a
great
many
things
he
had
done
and
regaled
her
with
anecdotes
of
western
life
she
was
from
philadelphia
and
with
her
eight
years
in
paris
talked
of
herself
as
a
languid
oriental
but
some
other
person
was
always
the
hero
of
the
tale
by
no
means
always
to
his
advantage
and
newman
s
own
emotions
were
but
scantily
chronicled
she
had
an
especial
wish
to
know
whether
he
had
ever
been
in
love
seriously
passionately
and
failing
to
gather
any
satisfaction
from
his
allusions
she
at
last
directly
inquired
he
hesitated
a
while
and
at
last
he
said
no
she
declared
that
she
was
delighted
to
hear
it
as
it
confirmed
her
private
conviction
that
he
was
a
man
of
no
feeling
really
he
asked
very
gravely
do
you
think
so
how
do
you
recognize
a
man
of
feeling
i
can
t
make
out
said
tristram
whether
you
are
very
simple
or
very
i
m
very
deep
that
s
a
i
believe
that
if
i
were
to
tell
you
with
a
certain
air
that
you
have
no
feeling
you
would
implicitly
believe
a
certain
air
said
newman
try
it
and
you
would
believe
me
but
you
would
not
care
said
tristram
you
have
got
it
all
wrong
i
should
care
immensely
but
i
shouldn
t
believe
you
the
fact
is
i
have
never
had
time
to
feel
things
i
have
had
to
them
to
make
myself
i
can
imagine
that
you
may
have
done
that
tremendously
yes
there
s
no
mistake
about
when
you
are
in
a
fury
it
can
t
be
i
am
never
in
a
angry
then
or
i
am
never
angry
and
it
is
so
long
since
i
have
been
displeased
that
i
have
quite
forgotten
i
don
t
believe
said
tristram
that
you
are
never
angry
a
man
ought
to
be
angry
sometimes
and
you
are
neither
good
enough
nor
bad
enough
always
to
keep
your
i
lose
it
perhaps
once
in
five
the
time
is
coming
round
then
said
his
hostess
before
i
have
known
you
six
months
i
shall
see
you
in
a
fine
do
you
mean
to
put
me
into
one
i
should
not
be
sorry
you
take
things
too
coolly
it
exasperates
me
and
then
you
are
too
happy
you
have
what
must
be
the
most
agreeable
thing
in
the
world
the
consciousness
of
having
bought
your
pleasure
beforehand
and
paid
for
it
you
have
not
a
day
of
reckoning
staring
you
in
the
face
your
reckonings
are
well
i
suppose
i
am
happy
said
newman
meditatively
you
have
been
odiously
successful
in
copper
said
newman
only
in
railroads
and
a
hopeless
fizzle
in
it
is
very
disagreeable
to
know
how
americans
have
made
their
money
now
you
have
the
world
before
you
you
have
only
to
oh
i
suppose
i
am
very
well
off
said
newman
only
i
am
tired
of
having
it
thrown
up
at
me
besides
there
are
several
drawbacks
i
am
not
one
doesn
t
expect
it
of
you
tristram
answered
then
in
a
moment
besides
you
are
well
i
mean
to
have
a
good
time
whether
or
no
said
newman
i
am
not
cultivated
i
am
not
even
educated
i
know
nothing
about
history
or
art
or
foreign
tongues
or
any
other
learned
matters
but
i
am
not
a
fool
either
and
i
shall
undertake
to
know
something
about
europe
by
the
time
i
have
done
with
it
i
feel
something
under
my
ribs
here
he
added
in
a
moment
that
i
can
t
explain
a
sort
of
a
mighty
hankering
a
desire
to
stretch
out
and
haul
bravo
said
tristram
that
is
very
fine
you
are
the
great
western
barbarian
stepping
forth
in
his
innocence
and
might
gazing
a
while
at
this
poor
effete
old
world
and
then
swooping
down
on
oh
come
said
newman
i
am
not
a
barbarian
by
a
good
deal
i
am
very
much
the
reverse
i
have
seen
barbarians
i
know
what
they
i
don
t
mean
that
you
are
a
comanche
chief
or
that
you
wear
a
blanket
and
feathers
there
are
different
i
am
a
highly
civilized
man
said
newman
i
stick
to
that
if
you
don
t
believe
it
i
should
like
to
prove
it
to
tristram
was
silent
a
while
i
should
like
to
make
you
prove
it
she
said
at
last
i
should
like
to
put
you
in
a
difficult
pray
do
said
newman
that
has
a
little
conceited
sound
his
companion
rejoined
oh
said
newman
i
have
a
very
good
opinion
of
i
wish
i
could
put
it
to
the
test
give
me
time
and
i
and
tristram
remained
silent
for
some
time
afterwards
as
if
she
was
trying
to
keep
her
pledge
it
did
not
appear
that
evening
that
she
succeeded
but
as
he
was
rising
to
take
his
leave
she
passed
suddenly
as
she
was
very
apt
to
do
from
the
tone
of
unsparing
persiflage
to
that
of
almost
tremulous
sympathy
speaking
seriously
she
said
i
believe
in
you
newman
you
flatter
my
your
patriotism
christopher
demanded
even
so
it
would
take
too
long
to
explain
and
you
probably
would
not
understand
besides
you
might
take
it
really
you
might
take
it
for
a
declaration
but
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
you
personally
it
s
what
you
represent
fortunately
you
don
t
know
all
that
or
your
conceit
would
increase
newman
stood
staring
and
wondering
what
under
the
sun
he
forgive
all
my
meddlesome
chatter
and
forget
my
advice
it
is
very
silly
in
me
to
undertake
to
tell
you
what
to
do
when
you
are
embarrassed
do
as
you
think
best
and
you
will
do
very
well
when
you
are
in
a
difficulty
judge
for
i
shall
remember
everything
you
have
told
me
said
newman
there
are
so
many
forms
and
ceremonies
over
here
forms
and
ceremonies
are
what
i
mean
of
ah
but
i
want
to
observe
them
said
newman
haven
t
i
as
good
a
right
as
another
they
don
t
scare
me
and
you
needn
t
give
me
leave
to
violate
them
i
won
t
take
that
is
not
what
i
mean
i
mean
observe
them
in
your
own
way
settle
nice
questions
for
yourself
cut
the
knot
or
untie
it
as
you
oh
i
am
sure
i
shall
never
fumble
over
it
said
newman
the
next
time
that
he
dined
in
the
avenue
d
iéna
was
a
sunday
a
day
on
which
tristram
left
the
cards
unshuffled
so
that
there
was
a
trio
in
the
evening
on
the
balcony
the
talk
was
of
many
things
and
at
last
tristram
suddenly
observed
to
christopher
newman
that
it
was
high
time
he
should
take
a
wife
listen
to
her
she
has
the
audacity
said
tristram
who
on
sunday
evenings
was
always
rather
acrimonious
i
don
t
suppose
you
have
made
up
your
mind
not
to
marry
tristram
continued
heaven
forbid
cried
newman
i
am
sternly
resolved
on
it
s
very
easy
said
tristram
fatally
easy
well
then
i
suppose
you
do
not
mean
to
wait
till
you
are
on
the
contrary
i
am
in
a
great
one
would
never
suppose
it
do
you
expect
a
lady
to
come
and
propose
to
you
no
i
am
willing
to
propose
i
think
a
great
deal
about
tell
me
some
of
your
well
said
newman
slowly
i
want
to
marry
very
marry
a
woman
of
sixty
then
said
tristram
well
in
what
sense
in
every
sense
i
shall
be
hard
to
you
must
remember
that
as
the
french
proverb
says
the
most
beautiful
girl
in
the
world
can
give
but
what
she
since
you
ask
me
said
newman
i
will
say
frankly
that
i
want
extremely
to
marry
it
is
time
to
begin
with
before
i
know
it
i
shall
be
forty
and
then
i
m
lonely
and
helpless
and
dull
but
if
i
marry
now
so
long
as
i
didn
t
do
it
in
hot
haste
when
i
was
twenty
i
must
do
it
with
my
eyes
open
i
want
to
do
the
thing
in
handsome
style
i
do
not
only
want
to
make
no
mistakes
but
i
want
to
make
a
great
hit
i
want
to
take
my
pick
my
wife
must
be
a
magnificent
ce
qui
s
appelle
parler
cried
tristram
oh
i
have
thought
an
immense
deal
about
perhaps
you
think
too
much
the
best
thing
is
simply
to
fall
in
when
i
find
the
woman
who
pleases
me
i
shall
love
her
enough
my
wife
shall
be
very
you
are
superb
there
s
a
chance
for
the
magnificent
you
are
not
newman
rejoined
you
draw
a
fellow
out
and
put
him
off
guard
and
then
you
laugh
at
i
assure
you
said
tristram
that
i
am
very
serious
to
prove
it
i
will
make
you
a
proposal
should
you
like
me
as
they
say
here
to
marry
you
to
hunt
up
a
wife
for
me
she
is
already
found
i
will
bring
you
oh
come
said
tristram
we
don
t
keep
a
matrimonial
bureau
he
will
think
you
want
your
present
me
to
a
woman
who
comes
up
to
my
notions
said
newman
and
i
will
marry
her
you
have
a
strange
tone
about
it
and
i
don
t
quite
understand
you
i
didn
t
suppose
you
would
be
so
coldblooded
and
newman
was
silent
a
while
well
he
said
at
last
i
want
a
great
woman
i
stick
to
that
that
s
one
thing
i
treat
myself
to
and
if
it
is
to
be
had
i
mean
to
have
it
what
else
have
i
toiled
and
struggled
for
all
these
years
i
have
succeeded
and
now
what
am
i
to
do
with
my
success
to
make
it
perfect
as
i
see
it
there
must
be
a
beautiful
woman
perched
on
the
pile
like
a
statue
on
a
monument
she
must
be
as
good
as
she
is
beautiful
and
as
clever
as
she
is
good
i
can
give
my
wife
a
good
deal
so
i
am
not
afraid
to
ask
a
good
deal
myself
she
shall
have
everything
a
woman
can
desire
i
shall
not
even
object
to
her
being
too
good
for
me
she
may
be
cleverer
and
wiser
than
i
can
understand
and
i
shall
only
be
the
better
pleased
i
want
to
possess
in
a
word
the
best
article
in
the
why
didn
t
you
tell
a
fellow
all
this
at
the
outset
tristram
demanded
i
have
been
trying
so
to
make
you
fond
of
this
is
very
interesting
said
tristram
i
like
to
see
a
man
know
his
own
i
have
known
mine
for
a
long
time
newman
went
on
i
made
up
my
mind
tolerably
early
in
life
that
a
beautiful
wife
was
the
thing
best
worth
having
here
below
it
is
the
greatest
victory
over
circumstances
when
i
say
beautiful
i
mean
beautiful
in
mind
and
in
manners
as
well
as
in
person
it
is
a
thing
every
man
has
an
equal
right
to
he
may
get
it
if
he
can
he
doesn
t
have
to
be
born
with
certain
faculties
on
purpose
he
needs
only
to
be
a
man
then
he
needs
only
to
use
his
will
and
such
wits
as
he
has
and
to
it
strikes
me
that
your
marriage
is
to
be
rather
a
matter
of
well
it
is
certain
said
newman
that
if
people
notice
my
wife
and
admire
her
i
shall
be
mightily
after
this
cried
tristram
call
any
man
modest
but
none
of
them
will
admire
her
so
much
as
i
see
you
have
a
taste
for
newman
hesitated
a
little
and
then
i
honestly
believe
i
have
he
said
and
i
suppose
you
have
already
looked
about
you
a
good
a
good
deal
according
to
and
you
have
seen
nothing
that
satisfied
you
no
said
newman
half
reluctantly
i
am
bound
to
say
in
honesty
that
i
have
seen
nothing
that
really
satisfied
you
remind
me
of
the
heroes
of
the
french
romantic
poets
rolla
and
fortunio
and
all
those
other
insatiable
gentlemen
for
whom
nothing
in
this
world
was
handsome
enough
but
i
see
you
are
in
earnest
and
i
should
like
to
help
who
the
deuce
is
it
darling
that
you
are
going
to
put
upon
him
tristram
cried
we
know
a
good
many
pretty
girls
thank
heaven
but
magnificent
women
are
not
so
have
you
any
objections
to
a
foreigner
his
wife
continued
addressing
newman
who
had
tilted
back
his
chair
and
with
his
feet
on
a
bar
of
the
balcony
railing
and
his
hands
in
his
pockets
was
looking
at
the
stars
no
irish
need
apply
said
tristram
newman
meditated
a
while
as
a
foreigner
no
he
said
at
last
i
have
no
my
dear
fellow
you
have
no
suspicions
cried
tristram
you
don
t
know
what
terrible
customers
these
foreign
women
are
especially
the
magnificent
ones
how
should
you
like
a
fair
circassian
with
a
dagger
in
her
belt
newman
administered
a
vigorous
slap
to
his
knee
i
would
marry
a
japanese
if
she
pleased
me
he
affirmed
we
had
better
confine
ourselves
to
europe
said
tristram
the
only
thing
is
then
that
the
person
be
in
herself
to
your
taste
she
is
going
to
offer
you
an
unappreciated
governess
tristram
groaned
assuredly
i
won
t
deny
that
other
things
being
equal
i
should
prefer
one
of
my
own
countrywomen
we
should
speak
the
same
language
and
that
would
be
a
comfort
but
i
am
not
afraid
of
a
foreigner
besides
i
rather
like
the
idea
of
taking
in
europe
too
it
enlarges
the
field
of
selection
when
you
choose
from
a
greater
number
you
can
bring
your
choice
to
a
finer
point
you
talk
like
sardanapalus
exclaimed
tristram
you
say
all
this
to
the
right
person
said
newman
s
hostess
i
happen
to
number
among
my
friends
the
loveliest
woman
in
the
world
neither
more
nor
less
i
don
t
say
a
very
charming
person
or
a
very
estimable
woman
or
a
very
great
beauty
i
say
simply
the
loveliest
woman
in
the
the
deuce
cried
tristram
you
have
kept
very
quiet
about
her
were
you
afraid
of
me
you
have
seen
her
said
his
wife
but
you
have
no
perception
of
such
merit
as
claire
ah
her
name
is
claire
i
give
it
does
your
friend
wish
to
marry
asked
newman
not
in
the
least
it
is
for
you
to
make
her
change
her
mind
it
will
not
be
easy
she
has
had
one
husband
and
he
gave
her
a
low
opinion
of
the
oh
she
is
a
widow
then
said
newman
are
you
already
afraid
she
was
married
at
eighteen
by
her
parents
in
the
french
fashion
to
a
disagreeable
old
man
but
he
had
the
good
taste
to
die
a
couple
of
years
afterward
and
she
is
now
so
she
is
french
french
by
her
father
english
by
her
mother
she
is
really
more
english
than
french
and
she
speaks
english
as
well
as
you
or
i
or
rather
much
better
she
belongs
to
the
very
top
of
the
basket
as
they
say
here
her
family
on
each
side
is
of
fabulous
antiquity
her
mother
is
the
daughter
of
an
english
catholic
earl
her
father
is
dead
and
since
her
widowhood
she
has
lived
with
her
mother
and
a
married
brother
there
is
another
brother
younger
who
i
believe
is
wild
they
have
an
old
hotel
in
the
rue
de
l
université
but
their
fortune
is
small
and
they
make
a
common
household
for
economy
s
sake
when
i
was
a
girl
i
was
put
into
a
convent
here
for
my
education
while
my
father
made
the
tour
of
europe
it
was
a
silly
thing
to
do
with
me
but
it
had
the
advantage
that
it
made
me
acquainted
with
claire
de
bellegarde
she
was
younger
than
i
but
we
became
fast
friends
i
took
a
tremendous
fancy
to
her
and
she
returned
my
passion
as
far
as
she
could
they
kept
such
a
tight
rein
on
her
that
she
could
do
very
little
and
when
i
left
the
convent
she
had
to
give
me
up
i
was
not
of
her
i
am
not
now
either
but
we
sometimes
meet
they
are
terrible
people
her
all
mounted
upon
stilts
a
mile
high
and
with
pedigrees
long
in
proportion
it
is
the
skim
of
the
milk
of
the
old
do
you
know
what
a
legitimist
is
or
an
ultramontane
go
into
madame
de
cintré
s
some
afternoon
at
five
o
clock
and
you
will
see
the
best
preserved
specimens
i
say
go
but
no
one
is
admitted
who
can
t
show
his
fifty
and
this
is
the
lady
you
propose
to
me
to
marry
asked
newman
a
lady
i
can
t
even
approach
but
you
said
just
now
that
you
recognized
no
newman
looked
at
tristram
a
while
stroking
his
moustache
is
she
a
beauty
he
demanded
oh
then
it
s
no
use
she
is
not
a
beauty
but
she
is
beautiful
two
very
different
things
a
beauty
has
no
faults
in
her
face
the
face
of
a
beautiful
woman
may
have
faults
that
only
deepen
its
i
remember
madame
de
cintré
now
said
tristram
she
is
as
plain
as
a
a
man
wouldn
t
look
at
her
in
saying
that
would
not
look
at
her
twice
my
husband
sufficiently
describes
her
tristram
rejoined
is
she
good
is
she
clever
newman
asked
she
is
perfect
i
won
t
say
more
than
that
when
you
are
praising
a
person
to
another
who
is
to
know
her
it
is
bad
policy
to
go
into
details
i
won
t
exaggerate
i
simply
recommend
her
among
all
women
i
have
known
she
stands
alone
she
is
of
a
different
i
should
like
to
see
her
said
newman
simply
i
will
try
to
manage
it
the
only
way
will
be
to
invite
her
to
dinner
i
have
never
invited
her
before
and
i
don
t
know
that
she
will
come
her
old
feudal
countess
of
a
mother
rules
the
family
with
an
iron
hand
and
allows
her
to
have
no
friends
but
of
her
own
choosing
and
to
visit
only
in
a
certain
sacred
circle
but
i
can
at
least
ask
at
this
moment
tristram
was
interrupted
a
servant
stepped
out
upon
the
balcony
and
announced
that
there
were
visitors
in
the
when
newman
s
hostess
had
gone
in
to
receive
her
friends
tom
tristram
approached
his
guest
don
t
put
your
foot
into
my
boy
he
said
puffing
the
last
whiffs
of
his
cigar
there
s
nothing
in
it
newman
looked
askance
at
him
inquisitive
you
tell
another
story
eh
i
say
simply
that
madame
de
cintré
is
a
great
white
doll
of
a
woman
who
cultivates
quiet
ah
she
s
haughty
eh
she
looks
at
you
as
if
you
were
so
much
thin
air
and
cares
for
you
about
as
she
is
very
proud
eh
proud
as
proud
as
i
m
and
not
tristram
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
s
a
kind
of
beauty
you
must
be
to
understand
but
i
must
go
in
and
amuse
the
some
time
elapsed
before
newman
followed
his
friends
into
the
when
he
at
last
made
his
appearance
there
he
remained
but
a
short
time
and
during
this
period
sat
perfectly
silent
listening
to
a
lady
to
whom
tristram
had
straightway
introduced
him
and
who
chattered
without
a
pause
with
the
full
force
of
an
extraordinarily
voice
newman
gazed
and
attended
presently
he
came
to
bid
to
tristram
who
is
that
lady
he
asked
miss
dora
finch
how
do
you
like
her
she
s
too
she
is
thought
so
bright
certainly
you
are
fastidious
said
tristram
newman
stood
a
moment
hesitating
then
at
last
don
t
forget
about
your
friend
he
said
madame
what
the
proud
beauty
ask
her
to
dinner
and
give
me
a
good
and
with
this
he
departed
some
days
later
he
came
back
it
was
in
the
afternoon
he
found
tristram
in
her
with
her
was
a
visitor
a
woman
young
and
pretty
dressed
in
white
the
two
ladies
had
risen
and
the
visitor
was
apparently
taking
her
leave
as
newman
approached
he
received
from
tristram
a
glance
of
the
most
vivid
significance
which
he
was
not
immediately
able
to
interpret
this
is
a
good
friend
of
ours
she
said
turning
to
her
companion
mr
christopher
newman
i
have
spoken
of
you
to
him
and
he
has
an
extreme
desire
to
make
your
acquaintance
if
you
had
consented
to
come
and
dine
i
should
have
offered
him
an
the
stranger
turned
her
face
toward
newman
with
a
smile
he
was
not
embarrassed
for
his
unconscious
was
boundless
but
as
he
became
aware
that
this
was
the
proud
and
beautiful
madame
de
cintré
the
loveliest
woman
in
the
world
the
promised
perfection
the
proposed
ideal
he
made
an
instinctive
movement
to
gather
his
wits
together
through
the
slight
preoccupation
that
it
produced
he
had
a
sense
of
a
long
fair
face
and
of
two
eyes
that
were
both
brilliant
and
mild
i
should
have
been
most
happy
said
madame
de
cintré
unfortunately
as
i
have
been
telling
tristram
i
go
on
monday
to
the
newman
had
made
a
solemn
bow
i
am
very
sorry
he
said
paris
is
getting
too
warm
madame
de
cintré
added
taking
her
friend
s
hand
again
in
farewell
tristram
seemed
to
have
formed
a
sudden
and
somewhat
venturesome
resolution
and
she
smiled
more
intensely
as
women
do
when
they
take
such
resolution
i
want
newman
to
know
you
she
said
dropping
her
head
on
one
side
and
looking
at
madame
de
cintré
s
bonnet
ribbons
christopher
newman
stood
gravely
silent
while
his
native
penetration
admonished
him
tristram
was
determined
to
force
her
friend
to
address
him
a
word
of
encouragement
which
should
be
more
than
one
of
the
common
formulas
of
politeness
and
if
she
was
prompted
by
charity
it
was
by
the
charity
that
begins
at
home
madame
de
cintré
was
her
dearest
claire
and
her
especial
admiration
but
madame
de
cintré
had
found
it
impossible
to
dine
with
her
and
madame
de
cintré
should
for
once
be
forced
gently
to
render
tribute
to
tristram
it
would
give
me
great
pleasure
she
said
looking
at
tristram
that
s
a
great
deal
cried
the
latter
for
madame
de
cintré
to
say
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
said
newman
mrs
tristram
can
speak
better
for
me
than
i
can
speak
for
madame
de
cintré
looked
at
him
again
with
the
same
soft
brightness
are
you
to
be
long
in
paris
she
asked
we
shall
keep
him
said
tristram
but
you
are
keeping
and
madame
de
cintré
shook
her
friend
s
hand
a
moment
longer
said
tristram
madame
de
cintré
looked
at
newman
again
this
time
without
her
smile
her
eyes
lingered
a
moment
will
you
come
and
see
me
she
asked
tristram
kissed
her
newman
expressed
his
thanks
and
she
took
her
leave
her
hostess
went
with
her
to
the
door
and
left
newman
alone
a
moment
presently
she
returned
rubbing
her
hands
it
was
a
fortunate
chance
she
said
she
had
come
to
decline
my
invitation
you
triumphed
on
the
spot
making
her
ask
you
at
the
end
of
three
minutes
to
her
it
was
you
who
triumphed
said
newman
you
must
not
be
too
hard
upon
tristram
stared
what
do
you
mean
she
did
not
strike
me
as
so
proud
i
should
say
she
was
you
are
very
discriminating
and
what
do
you
think
of
her
face
it
s
handsome
said
newman
i
should
think
it
was
of
course
you
will
go
and
see
cried
newman
no
not
the
next
day
that
will
be
sunday
she
leaves
paris
on
monday
if
you
don
t
see
her
it
will
at
least
be
a
and
she
gave
him
madame
de
cintré
s
address
he
walked
across
the
seine
late
in
the
summer
afternoon
and
made
his
way
through
those
gray
and
silent
streets
of
the
faubourg
germain
whose
houses
present
to
the
outer
world
a
face
as
impassive
and
as
suggestive
of
the
concentration
of
privacy
within
as
the
blank
walls
of
eastern
seraglios
newman
thought
it
a
queer
way
for
rich
people
to
live
his
ideal
of
grandeur
was
a
splendid
façade
diffusing
its
brilliancy
outward
too
irradiating
hospitality
the
house
to
which
he
had
been
directed
had
a
dark
dusty
painted
portal
which
swung
open
in
answer
to
his
ring
it
admitted
him
into
a
wide
gravelled
court
surrounded
on
three
sides
with
closed
windows
and
with
a
doorway
facing
the
street
approached
by
three
steps
and
surmounted
by
a
tin
canopy
the
place
was
all
in
the
shade
it
answered
to
newman
s
conception
of
a
convent
the
portress
could
not
tell
him
whether
madame
de
cintré
was
visible
he
would
please
to
apply
at
the
farther
door
he
crossed
the
court
a
gentleman
was
sitting
bareheaded
on
the
steps
of
the
portico
playing
with
a
beautiful
pointer
he
rose
as
newman
approached
and
as
he
laid
his
hand
upon
the
bell
said
with
a
smile
in
english
that
he
was
afraid
newman
would
be
kept
waiting
the
servants
were
scattered
he
himself
had
been
ringing
he
didn
t
know
what
the
deuce
was
in
them
he
was
a
young
man
his
english
was
excellent
and
his
smile
very
frank
newman
pronounced
the
name
of
madame
de
cintré
i
think
said
the
young
man
that
my
sister
is
visible
come
in
and
if
you
will
give
me
your
card
i
will
carry
it
to
her
newman
had
been
accompanied
on
his
present
errand
by
a
slight
sentiment
i
will
not
say
of
defiance
a
readiness
for
aggression
or
defence
as
they
might
prove
needful
but
of
reflection
suspicion
he
took
from
his
pocket
while
he
stood
on
the
portico
a
card
upon
which
under
his
name
he
had
written
the
words
san
francisco
and
while
he
presented
it
he
looked
warily
at
his
interlocutor
his
glance
was
singularly
reassuring
he
liked
the
young
man
s
face
it
strongly
resembled
that
of
madame
de
cintré
he
was
evidently
her
brother
the
young
man
on
his
side
had
made
a
rapid
inspection
of
newman
s
person
he
had
taken
the
card
and
was
about
to
enter
the
house
with
it
when
another
figure
appeared
on
the
threshold
an
older
man
of
a
fine
presence
wearing
evening
dress
he
looked
hard
at
newman
and
newman
looked
at
him
madame
de
cintré
the
younger
man
repeated
as
an
introduction
of
the
visitor
the
other
took
the
card
from
his
hand
read
it
in
a
rapid
glance
looked
again
at
newman
from
head
to
foot
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
said
gravely
but
urbanely
madame
de
cintré
is
not
at
the
younger
man
made
a
gesture
and
then
turning
to
newman
i
am
very
sorry
sir
he
said
newman
gave
him
a
friendly
nod
to
show
that
he
bore
him
no
malice
and
retraced
his
steps
at
the
porter
s
lodge
he
stopped
the
two
men
were
still
standing
on
the
portico
who
is
the
gentleman
with
the
dog
he
asked
of
the
old
woman
who
reappeared
he
had
begun
to
learn
french
that
is
monsieur
le
and
the
other
that
is
monsieur
le
a
marquis
said
christopher
in
english
which
the
old
woman
fortunately
did
not
understand
oh
then
he
s
not
the
butler
chapter
iv
early
one
morning
before
christopher
newman
was
dressed
a
little
old
man
was
ushered
into
his
apartment
followed
by
a
youth
in
a
blouse
bearing
a
picture
in
a
brilliant
frame
newman
among
the
distractions
of
paris
had
forgotten
nioche
and
his
accomplished
daughter
but
this
was
an
effective
reminder
i
am
afraid
you
had
given
me
up
sir
said
the
old
man
after
many
apologies
and
salutations
we
have
made
you
wait
so
many
days
you
accused
us
perhaps
of
inconstancy
of
bad
faith
but
behold
me
at
last
and
behold
also
the
pretty
madonna
place
it
on
a
chair
my
friend
in
a
good
light
so
that
monsieur
may
admire
and
nioche
addressing
his
companion
helped
him
to
dispose
the
work
of
art
it
had
been
endued
with
a
layer
of
varnish
an
inch
thick
and
its
frame
of
an
elaborate
pattern
was
at
least
a
foot
wide
it
glittered
and
twinkled
in
the
morning
light
and
looked
to
newman
s
eyes
wonderfully
splendid
and
precious
it
seemed
to
him
a
very
happy
purchase
and
he
felt
rich
in
the
possession
of
it
he
stood
looking
at
it
complacently
while
he
proceeded
with
his
toilet
and
nioche
who
had
dismissed
his
own
attendant
hovered
near
smiling
and
rubbing
his
hands
it
has
wonderful
he
murmured
caressingly
and
here
and
there
are
marvelous
touches
you
probably
perceive
them
sir
it
attracted
great
attention
on
the
boulevard
as
we
came
along
and
then
a
gradation
of
tones
that
s
what
it
is
to
know
how
to
paint
i
don
t
say
it
because
i
am
her
father
sir
but
as
one
man
of
taste
addressing
another
i
can
not
help
observing
that
you
have
there
an
exquisite
work
it
is
hard
to
produce
such
things
and
to
have
to
part
with
them
if
our
means
only
allowed
us
the
luxury
of
keeping
it
i
really
may
say
sir
and
nioche
gave
a
little
feebly
insinuating
laugh
i
really
may
say
that
i
envy
you
you
see
he
added
in
a
moment
we
have
taken
the
liberty
of
offering
you
a
frame
it
increases
by
a
trifle
the
value
of
the
work
and
it
will
save
you
the
annoyance
so
great
for
a
person
of
your
delicacy
of
going
about
to
bargain
at
the
the
language
spoken
by
nioche
was
a
singular
compound
which
i
shrink
from
the
attempt
to
reproduce
in
its
integrity
he
had
apparently
once
possessed
a
certain
knowledge
of
english
and
his
accent
was
oddly
tinged
with
the
cockneyism
of
the
british
metropolis
but
his
learning
had
grown
rusty
with
disuse
and
his
vocabulary
was
defective
and
capricious
he
had
repaired
it
with
large
patches
of
french
with
words
anglicized
by
a
process
of
his
own
and
with
native
idioms
literally
translated
the
result
in
the
form
in
which
he
in
all
humility
presented
it
would
be
scarcely
comprehensible
to
the
reader
so
that
i
have
ventured
to
trim
and
sift
it
newman
only
half
understood
it
but
it
amused
him
and
the
old
man
s
decent
forlornness
appealed
to
his
democratic
instincts
the
assumption
of
a
fatality
in
misery
always
irritated
his
strong
good
nature
it
was
almost
the
only
thing
that
did
so
and
he
felt
the
impulse
to
wipe
it
out
as
it
were
with
the
sponge
of
his
own
prosperity
the
papa
of
mademoiselle
noémie
however
had
apparently
on
this
occasion
been
vigorously
indoctrinated
and
he
showed
a
certain
tremulous
eagerness
to
cultivate
unexpected
opportunities
how
much
do
i
owe
you
then
with
the
frame
asked
newman
it
will
make
in
all
three
thousand
francs
said
the
old
man
smiling
agreeably
but
folding
his
hands
in
instinctive
suppliance
can
you
give
me
a
receipt
i
have
brought
one
said
nioche
i
took
the
liberty
of
drawing
it
up
in
case
monsieur
should
happen
to
desire
to
discharge
his
and
he
drew
a
paper
from
his
and
presented
it
to
his
patron
the
document
was
written
in
a
minute
fantastic
hand
and
couched
in
the
choicest
language
newman
laid
down
the
money
and
nioche
dropped
the
napoleons
one
by
one
solemnly
and
lovingly
into
an
old
leathern
purse
and
how
is
your
young
lady
asked
newman
she
made
a
great
impression
on
an
impression
monsieur
is
very
good
monsieur
admires
her
appearance
she
is
very
pretty
alas
yes
she
is
very
pretty
and
what
is
the
harm
in
her
being
pretty
nioche
fixed
his
eyes
upon
a
spot
on
the
carpet
and
shook
his
head
then
looking
up
at
newman
with
a
gaze
that
seemed
to
brighten
and
expand
monsieur
knows
what
paris
is
she
is
dangerous
to
beauty
when
beauty
hasn
t
the
ah
but
that
is
not
the
case
with
your
daughter
she
is
rich
very
true
we
are
rich
for
six
months
but
if
my
daughter
were
a
plain
girl
i
should
sleep
better
all
the
you
are
afraid
of
the
young
men
the
young
and
the
old
she
ought
to
get
a
ah
monsieur
one
doesn
t
get
a
husband
for
nothing
her
husband
must
take
her
as
she
is
i
can
t
give
her
a
sou
but
the
young
men
don
t
see
with
that
oh
said
newman
her
talent
is
in
itself
a
ah
sir
it
needs
first
to
be
converted
into
specie
and
nioche
slapped
his
purse
tenderly
before
he
stowed
it
away
the
operation
doesn
t
take
place
every
well
your
young
men
are
very
shabby
said
newman
that
s
all
i
can
say
they
ought
to
pay
for
your
daughter
and
not
ask
money
those
are
very
noble
ideas
monsieur
but
what
will
you
have
they
are
not
the
ideas
of
this
country
we
want
to
know
what
we
are
about
when
we
how
big
a
portion
does
your
daughter
want
nioche
stared
as
if
he
wondered
what
was
coming
next
but
he
promptly
recovered
himself
at
a
venture
and
replied
that
he
knew
a
very
nice
young
man
employed
by
an
insurance
company
who
would
content
himself
with
fifteen
thousand
francs
let
your
daughter
paint
half
a
dozen
pictures
for
me
and
she
shall
have
her
half
a
dozen
pictures
her
dowry
monsieur
is
not
speaking
inconsiderately
if
she
will
make
me
six
or
eight
copies
in
the
louvre
as
pretty
as
that
madonna
i
will
pay
her
the
same
price
said
newman
poor
nioche
was
speechless
a
moment
with
amazement
and
gratitude
and
then
he
seized
newman
s
hand
pressed
it
between
his
own
ten
fingers
and
gazed
at
him
with
watery
eyes
as
pretty
as
that
they
shall
be
a
thousand
times
prettier
they
shall
be
magnificent
sublime
ah
if
i
only
knew
how
to
paint
myself
sir
so
that
i
might
lend
a
hand
what
can
i
do
to
thank
you
and
he
pressed
his
forehead
while
he
tried
to
think
of
something
oh
you
have
thanked
me
enough
said
newman
ah
here
it
is
sir
cried
nioche
to
express
my
gratitude
i
will
charge
you
nothing
for
the
lessons
in
french
the
lessons
i
had
quite
forgotten
them
listening
to
your
english
added
newman
laughing
is
almost
a
lesson
in
ah
i
don
t
profess
to
teach
english
certainly
said
nioche
but
for
my
own
admirable
tongue
i
am
still
at
your
since
you
are
here
then
said
newman
we
will
begin
this
is
a
very
good
hour
i
am
going
to
have
my
coffee
come
every
morning
at
nine
and
have
yours
with
monsieur
offers
me
my
coffee
also
cried
nioche
truly
my
are
coming
come
said
newman
let
us
begin
the
coffee
is
almighty
hot
how
do
you
say
that
in
french
every
day
then
for
the
following
three
weeks
the
minutely
respectable
figure
of
nioche
made
its
appearance
with
a
series
of
little
inquiring
and
apologetic
obeisances
among
the
aromatic
fumes
of
newman
s
morning
beverage
i
don
t
know
how
much
french
our
friend
learned
but
as
he
himself
said
if
the
attempt
did
him
no
good
it
could
at
any
rate
do
him
no
harm
and
it
amused
him
it
gratified
that
irregularly
sociable
side
of
his
nature
which
had
always
expressed
itself
in
a
relish
for
ungrammatical
conversation
and
which
often
even
in
his
busy
and
preoccupied
days
had
made
him
sit
on
rail
fences
in
young
western
towns
in
the
twilight
in
gossip
hardly
less
than
fraternal
with
humorous
loafers
and
obscure
he
had
notions
wherever
he
went
about
talking
with
the
natives
he
had
been
assured
and
his
judgment
approved
the
advice
that
in
traveling
abroad
it
was
an
excellent
thing
to
look
into
the
life
of
the
country
nioche
was
very
much
of
a
native
and
though
his
life
might
not
be
particularly
worth
looking
into
he
was
a
palpable
and
unit
in
that
picturesque
parisian
civilization
which
offered
our
hero
so
much
easy
entertainment
and
propounded
so
many
curious
problems
to
his
inquiring
and
practical
mind
newman
was
fond
of
statistics
he
liked
to
know
how
things
were
done
it
gratified
him
to
learn
what
taxes
were
paid
what
profits
were
gathered
what
commercial
habits
prevailed
how
the
battle
of
life
was
fought
nioche
as
a
reduced
capitalist
was
familiar
with
these
considerations
and
he
formulated
his
information
which
he
was
proud
to
be
able
to
impart
in
the
neatest
possible
terms
and
with
a
pinch
of
snuff
between
finger
and
thumb
as
a
frenchman
quite
apart
from
newman
s
napoleons
nioche
loved
conversation
and
even
in
his
decay
his
urbanity
had
not
grown
rusty
as
a
frenchman
too
he
could
give
a
clear
account
of
things
and
still
as
a
frenchman
when
his
knowledge
was
at
fault
he
could
supply
its
lapses
with
the
most
convenient
and
ingenious
hypotheses
the
little
shrunken
financier
was
intensely
delighted
to
have
questions
asked
him
and
he
scraped
together
information
by
frugal
processes
and
took
notes
in
his
little
greasy
of
incidents
which
might
interest
his
munificent
friend
he
read
old
almanacs
at
the
on
the
quays
and
he
began
to
frequent
another
where
more
newspapers
were
taken
and
his
postprandial
cost
him
a
penny
extra
and
where
he
used
to
con
the
tattered
sheets
for
curious
anecdotes
freaks
of
nature
and
strange
coincidences
he
would
relate
with
solemnity
the
next
morning
that
a
child
of
five
years
of
age
had
lately
died
at
bordeaux
whose
brain
had
been
found
to
weigh
sixty
ounces
the
brain
of
a
napoleon
or
a
washington
or
that
madame
p
in
the
rue
de
clichy
had
found
in
the
wadding
of
an
old
petticoat
the
sum
of
three
hundred
and
sixty
francs
which
she
had
lost
five
years
before
he
pronounced
his
words
with
great
distinctness
and
sonority
and
newman
assured
him
that
his
way
of
dealing
with
the
french
tongue
was
very
superior
to
the
bewildering
chatter
that
he
heard
in
other
mouths
upon
this
nioche
s
accent
became
more
finely
trenchant
than
ever
he
offered
to
read
extracts
from
lamartine
and
he
protested
that
although
he
did
endeavor
according
to
his
feeble
lights
to
cultivate
refinement
of
diction
monsieur
if
he
wanted
the
real
thing
should
go
to
the
théâtre
français
newman
took
an
interest
in
french
thriftiness
and
conceived
a
lively
admiration
for
parisian
economies
his
own
economic
genius
was
so
entirely
for
operations
on
a
larger
scale
and
to
move
at
his
ease
he
needed
so
imperatively
the
sense
of
great
risks
and
great
prizes
that
he
found
an
ungrudging
entertainment
in
the
spectacle
of
fortunes
made
by
the
aggregation
of
copper
coins
and
in
the
minute
subdivision
of
labor
and
profit
he
questioned
nioche
about
his
own
manner
of
life
and
felt
a
friendly
mixture
of
compassion
and
respect
over
the
recital
of
his
delicate
frugalities
the
worthy
man
told
him
how
at
one
period
he
and
his
daughter
had
supported
existence
comfortably
upon
the
sum
of
fifteen
sous
recently
having
succeeded
in
hauling
ashore
the
last
floating
fragments
of
the
wreck
of
his
fortune
his
budget
had
been
a
trifle
more
ample
but
they
still
had
to
count
their
sous
very
narrowly
and
nioche
intimated
with
a
sigh
that
mademoiselle
noémie
did
not
bring
to
this
task
that
zealous
cooperation
which
might
have
been
desired
but
what
will
you
have
he
asked
philosophically
one
is
young
one
is
pretty
one
needs
new
dresses
and
fresh
gloves
one
can
t
wear
shabby
gowns
among
the
splendors
of
the
but
your
daughter
earns
enough
to
pay
for
her
own
clothes
said
newman
nioche
looked
at
him
with
weak
uncertain
eyes
he
would
have
liked
to
be
able
to
say
that
his
daughter
s
talents
were
appreciated
and
that
her
crooked
little
daubs
commanded
a
market
but
it
seemed
a
scandal
to
abuse
the
credulity
of
this
stranger
who
without
a
suspicion
or
a
question
had
admitted
him
to
equal
social
rights
he
compromised
and
declared
that
while
it
was
obvious
that
mademoiselle
noémie
s
reproductions
of
the
old
masters
had
only
to
be
seen
to
be
coveted
the
prices
which
in
consideration
of
their
altogether
peculiar
degree
of
finish
she
felt
obliged
to
ask
for
them
had
kept
purchasers
at
a
respectful
distance
poor
little
one
said
nioche
with
a
sigh
it
is
almost
a
pity
that
her
work
is
so
perfect
it
would
be
in
her
interest
to
paint
less
but
if
mademoiselle
noémie
has
this
devotion
to
her
art
newman
once
observed
why
should
you
have
those
fears
for
her
that
you
spoke
of
the
other
day
nioche
meditated
there
was
an
inconsistency
in
his
position
it
made
him
chronically
uncomfortable
though
he
had
no
desire
to
destroy
the
goose
with
the
golden
eggs
newman
s
benevolent
confidence
he
felt
a
tremulous
impulse
to
speak
out
all
his
trouble
ah
she
is
an
artist
my
dear
sir
most
assuredly
he
declared
but
to
tell
you
the
truth
she
is
also
a
i
am
sorry
to
say
he
added
in
a
moment
shaking
his
head
with
a
world
of
harmless
bitterness
that
she
comes
honestly
by
it
her
mother
was
one
before
her
you
were
not
happy
with
your
wife
newman
asked
nioche
gave
half
a
dozen
little
backward
jerks
of
his
head
she
was
my
purgatory
monsieur
she
deceived
you
under
my
nose
year
after
year
i
was
too
stupid
and
the
temptation
was
too
great
but
i
found
her
out
at
last
i
have
only
been
once
in
my
life
a
man
to
be
afraid
of
i
know
it
very
well
it
was
in
that
hour
nevertheless
i
don
t
like
to
think
of
it
i
loved
her
i
can
t
tell
you
how
much
she
was
a
bad
she
is
not
living
she
has
gone
to
her
her
influence
on
your
daughter
then
said
newman
encouragingly
is
not
to
be
she
cared
no
more
for
her
daughter
than
for
the
sole
of
her
shoe
but
noémie
has
no
need
of
influence
she
is
sufficient
to
herself
she
is
stronger
than
she
doesn
t
obey
you
eh
she
can
t
obey
monsieur
since
i
don
t
command
what
would
be
the
use
it
would
only
irritate
her
and
drive
her
to
some
de
she
is
very
clever
like
her
mother
she
would
waste
no
time
about
it
as
a
child
when
i
was
happy
or
supposed
i
was
she
studied
drawing
and
painting
with
professors
and
they
assured
me
she
had
a
talent
i
was
delighted
to
believe
it
and
when
i
went
into
society
i
used
to
carry
her
pictures
with
me
in
a
portfolio
and
hand
them
round
to
the
company
i
remember
once
a
lady
thought
i
was
offering
them
for
sale
and
i
took
it
very
we
don
t
know
what
we
may
come
to
then
came
my
dark
days
and
my
explosion
with
madame
nioche
noémie
had
no
more
lessons
but
in
the
course
of
time
when
she
grew
older
and
it
became
highly
expedient
that
she
should
do
something
that
would
help
to
keep
us
alive
she
bethought
herself
of
her
palette
and
brushes
some
of
our
friends
in
the
pronounced
the
idea
fantastic
they
recommended
her
to
try
bonnet
making
to
get
a
situation
in
a
shop
or
if
she
was
more
ambitious
to
advertise
for
a
place
of
de
she
did
advertise
and
an
old
lady
wrote
her
a
letter
and
bade
her
come
and
see
her
the
old
lady
liked
her
and
offered
her
her
living
and
six
hundred
francs
a
year
but
noémie
discovered
that
she
passed
her
life
in
her
armchair
and
had
only
two
visitors
her
confessor
and
her
nephew
the
confessor
very
strict
and
the
nephew
a
man
of
fifty
with
a
broken
nose
and
a
government
clerkship
of
two
thousand
francs
she
threw
her
old
lady
over
bought
a
a
canvas
and
a
new
dress
and
went
and
set
up
her
easel
in
the
louvre
there
in
one
place
and
another
she
has
passed
the
last
two
years
i
can
t
say
it
has
made
us
millionaires
but
noémie
tells
me
that
rome
was
not
built
in
a
day
that
she
is
making
great
progress
that
i
must
leave
her
to
her
own
devices
the
fact
is
without
prejudice
to
her
genius
that
she
has
no
idea
of
burying
herself
alive
she
likes
to
see
the
world
and
to
be
seen
she
says
herself
that
she
can
t
work
in
the
dark
with
her
appearance
it
is
very
natural
only
i
can
t
help
worrying
and
trembling
and
wondering
what
may
happen
to
her
there
all
alone
day
after
day
amid
all
that
coming
and
going
of
strangers
i
can
t
be
always
at
her
side
i
go
with
her
in
the
morning
and
i
come
to
fetch
her
away
but
she
won
t
have
me
near
her
in
the
interval
she
says
i
make
her
nervous
as
if
it
didn
t
make
me
nervous
to
wander
about
all
day
without
her
ah
if
anything
were
to
happen
to
her
cried
nioche
clenching
his
two
fists
and
jerking
back
his
head
again
portentously
oh
i
guess
nothing
will
happen
said
newman
i
believe
i
should
shoot
her
said
the
old
man
solemnly
oh
we
ll
marry
her
said
newman
since
that
s
how
you
manage
it
and
i
will
go
and
see
her
tomorrow
at
the
louvre
and
pick
out
the
pictures
she
is
to
copy
for
nioche
had
brought
newman
a
message
from
his
daughter
in
acceptance
of
his
magnificent
commission
the
young
lady
declaring
herself
his
most
devoted
servant
promising
her
most
zealous
endeavor
and
regretting
that
the
proprieties
forbade
her
coming
to
thank
him
in
person
the
morning
after
the
conversation
just
narrated
newman
reverted
to
his
intention
of
meeting
mademoiselle
noémie
at
the
louvre
nioche
appeared
preoccupied
and
left
his
budget
of
anecdotes
unopened
he
took
a
great
deal
of
snuff
and
sent
certain
oblique
appealing
glances
toward
his
stalwart
pupil
at
last
when
he
was
taking
his
leave
he
stood
a
moment
after
he
had
polished
his
hat
with
his
calico
with
his
small
pale
eyes
fixed
strangely
upon
newman
what
s
the
matter
our
hero
demanded
excuse
the
solicitude
of
a
father
s
heart
said
nioche
you
inspire
me
with
boundless
confidence
but
i
can
t
help
giving
you
a
warning
after
all
you
are
a
man
you
are
young
and
at
liberty
let
me
beseech
you
then
to
respect
the
innocence
of
mademoiselle
nioche
newman
had
wondered
what
was
coming
and
at
this
he
broke
into
a
laugh
he
was
on
the
point
of
declaring
that
his
own
innocence
struck
him
as
the
more
exposed
but
he
contented
himself
with
promising
to
treat
the
young
girl
with
nothing
less
than
veneration
he
found
her
waiting
for
him
seated
upon
the
great
divan
in
the
salon
carré
she
was
not
in
her
costume
but
wore
her
bonnet
and
gloves
and
carried
her
parasol
in
honor
of
the
occasion
these
articles
had
been
selected
with
unerring
taste
and
a
fresher
prettier
image
of
youthful
alertness
and
blooming
discretion
was
not
to
be
conceived
she
made
newman
a
most
respectful
curtsey
and
expressed
her
gratitude
for
his
liberality
in
a
wonderfully
graceful
little
speech
it
annoyed
him
to
have
a
charming
young
girl
stand
there
thanking
him
and
it
made
him
feel
uncomfortable
to
think
that
this
perfect
young
lady
with
her
excellent
manners
and
her
finished
intonation
was
literally
in
his
pay
he
assured
her
in
such
french
as
he
could
muster
that
the
thing
was
not
worth
mentioning
and
that
he
considered
her
services
a
great
favor
whenever
you
please
then
said
mademoiselle
noémie
we
will
pass
the
they
walked
slowly
round
the
room
then
passed
into
the
others
and
strolled
about
for
half
an
hour
mademoiselle
noémie
evidently
relished
her
situation
and
had
no
desire
to
bring
her
public
interview
with
her
patron
to
a
close
newman
perceived
that
prosperity
agreed
with
her
the
little
peremptory
air
with
which
she
had
addressed
her
father
on
the
occasion
of
their
former
meeting
had
given
place
to
the
most
lingering
and
caressing
tones
what
sort
of
pictures
do
you
desire
she
asked
sacred
or
profane
oh
a
few
of
each
said
newman
but
i
want
something
bright
and
something
gay
there
is
nothing
very
gay
in
this
solemn
old
louvre
but
we
will
see
what
we
can
find
you
speak
french
like
a
charm
my
father
has
done
oh
i
am
a
bad
subject
said
newman
i
am
too
old
to
learn
a
too
old
folie
cried
mademoiselle
noémie
with
a
clear
shrill
laugh
you
are
a
very
young
man
and
how
do
you
like
my
father
he
is
a
very
nice
old
gentleman
he
never
laughs
at
my
he
is
very
il
my
papa
said
mademoiselle
noémie
and
as
honest
as
the
day
oh
an
exceptional
probity
you
could
trust
him
with
do
you
always
obey
him
asked
newman
obey
him
do
you
do
what
he
bids
you
the
young
girl
stopped
and
looked
at
him
she
had
a
spot
of
color
in
either
cheek
and
in
her
expressive
french
eye
which
projected
too
much
for
perfect
beauty
there
was
a
slight
gleam
of
audacity
why
do
you
ask
me
that
she
demanded
because
i
want
to
you
think
me
a
bad
girl
and
she
gave
a
strange
smile
newman
looked
at
her
a
moment
he
saw
that
she
was
pretty
but
he
was
not
in
the
least
dazzled
he
remembered
poor
nioche
s
solicitude
for
her
innocence
and
he
laughed
as
his
eyes
met
hers
her
face
was
the
oddest
mixture
of
youth
and
maturity
and
beneath
her
candid
brow
her
searching
little
smile
seemed
to
contain
a
world
of
ambiguous
intentions
she
was
pretty
enough
certainly
to
make
her
father
nervous
but
as
regards
her
innocence
newman
felt
ready
on
the
spot
to
affirm
that
she
had
never
parted
with
it
she
had
simply
never
had
any
she
had
been
looking
at
the
world
since
she
was
ten
years
old
and
he
would
have
been
a
wise
man
who
could
tell
her
any
secrets
in
her
long
mornings
at
the
louvre
she
had
not
only
studied
madonnas
and
johns
she
had
kept
an
eye
upon
all
the
variously
embodied
human
nature
around
her
and
she
had
formed
her
conclusions
in
a
certain
sense
it
seemed
to
newman
nioche
might
be
at
rest
his
daughter
might
do
something
very
audacious
but
she
would
never
do
anything
foolish
newman
with
his
leisurely
smile
and
his
even
unhurried
utterance
was
always
mentally
taking
his
time
and
he
asked
himself
now
what
she
was
looking
at
him
in
that
way
for
he
had
an
idea
that
she
would
like
him
to
confess
that
he
did
think
her
a
bad
girl
oh
no
he
said
at
last
it
would
be
very
bad
manners
in
me
to
judge
you
that
way
i
don
t
know
but
my
father
has
complained
to
you
said
mademoiselle
noémie
he
says
you
are
a
he
shouldn
t
go
about
saying
such
things
to
gentlemen
but
you
don
t
believe
it
no
said
newman
gravely
i
don
t
believe
she
looked
at
him
again
gave
a
shrug
and
a
smile
and
then
pointed
to
a
small
italian
picture
a
marriage
of
catherine
how
should
you
like
that
she
asked
it
doesn
t
please
me
said
newman
the
young
lady
in
the
yellow
dress
is
not
ah
you
are
a
great
connoisseur
murmured
mademoiselle
noémie
in
pictures
oh
no
i
know
very
little
about
in
pretty
women
in
that
i
am
hardly
what
do
you
say
to
that
then
the
young
girl
asked
indicating
a
superb
italian
portrait
of
a
lady
i
will
do
it
for
you
on
a
smaller
on
a
smaller
scale
why
not
as
large
as
the
original
mademoiselle
noémie
glanced
at
the
glowing
splendor
of
the
venetian
masterpiece
and
gave
a
little
toss
of
her
head
i
don
t
like
that
woman
she
looks
i
do
like
her
said
newman
decidedly
i
must
have
her
as
large
as
life
and
just
as
stupid
as
she
is
the
young
girl
fixed
her
eyes
on
him
again
and
with
her
mocking
smile
it
certainly
ought
to
be
easy
for
me
to
make
her
look
stupid
she
said
what
do
you
mean
asked
newman
puzzled
she
gave
another
little
shrug
seriously
then
you
want
that
portrait
the
golden
hair
the
purple
satin
the
pearl
necklace
the
two
magnificent
arms
everything
just
as
it
would
nothing
else
do
instead
oh
i
want
some
other
things
but
i
want
that
mademoiselle
noémie
turned
away
a
moment
walked
to
the
other
side
of
the
hall
and
stood
there
looking
vaguely
about
her
at
last
she
came
back
it
must
be
charming
to
be
able
to
order
pictures
at
such
a
rate
venetian
portraits
as
large
as
life
you
go
at
it
and
you
are
going
to
travel
about
europe
that
way
yes
i
intend
to
travel
said
newman
ordering
buying
spending
money
of
course
i
shall
spend
some
you
are
very
happy
to
have
it
and
you
are
perfectly
free
how
do
you
mean
free
you
have
nothing
to
bother
you
no
family
no
wife
no
yes
i
am
tolerably
you
are
very
happy
said
mademoiselle
noémie
gravely
le
veux
bien
said
newman
proving
that
he
had
learned
more
french
than
he
admitted
and
how
long
shall
you
stay
in
paris
the
young
girl
went
on
only
a
few
days
why
do
you
go
away
it
is
getting
hot
and
i
must
go
to
to
switzerland
that
s
a
fine
country
i
would
give
my
new
parasol
to
see
it
lakes
and
mountains
romantic
valleys
and
icy
peaks
oh
i
congratulate
you
meanwhile
i
shall
sit
here
through
all
the
hot
summer
daubing
at
your
oh
take
your
time
about
it
said
newman
do
them
at
your
they
walked
farther
and
looked
at
a
dozen
other
things
newman
pointed
out
what
pleased
him
and
mademoiselle
noémie
generally
criticised
it
and
proposed
something
else
then
suddenly
she
diverged
and
began
to
talk
about
some
personal
matter
what
made
you
speak
to
me
the
other
day
in
the
salon
carré
she
abruptly
asked
i
admired
your
but
you
hesitated
a
long
oh
i
do
nothing
rashly
said
newman
yes
i
saw
you
watching
me
but
i
never
supposed
you
were
going
to
speak
to
me
i
never
dreamed
i
should
be
walking
about
here
with
you
it
s
very
it
is
very
natural
observed
newman
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
not
to
me
coquette
as
you
think
me
i
have
never
walked
about
in
public
with
a
gentleman
before
what
was
my
father
thinking
of
when
he
consented
to
our
interview
he
was
repenting
of
his
unjust
accusations
replied
newman
mademoiselle
noémie
remained
silent
at
last
she
dropped
into
a
seat
well
then
for
those
five
it
is
fixed
she
said
five
copies
as
brilliant
and
beautiful
as
i
can
make
them
we
have
one
more
to
choose
shouldn
t
you
like
one
of
those
great
rubenses
the
marriage
of
marie
de
médicis
just
look
at
it
and
see
how
handsome
it
oh
yes
i
should
like
that
said
newman
finish
off
with
finish
off
with
that
good
and
she
laughed
she
sat
a
moment
looking
at
him
and
then
she
suddenly
rose
and
stood
before
him
with
her
hands
hanging
and
clasped
in
front
of
her
i
don
t
understand
you
she
said
with
a
smile
i
don
t
understand
how
a
man
can
be
so
oh
i
am
ignorant
certainly
said
newman
putting
his
hands
into
his
pockets
it
s
ridiculous
i
don
t
know
how
to
you
don
t
know
how
i
paint
like
a
cat
i
can
t
draw
a
straight
line
i
never
sold
a
picture
until
you
bought
that
thing
the
other
and
as
she
offered
this
surprising
information
she
continued
to
smile
newman
burst
into
a
laugh
why
do
you
tell
me
this
he
asked
because
it
irritates
me
to
see
a
clever
man
blunder
so
my
pictures
are
and
the
one
i
possess
that
one
is
rather
worse
than
well
said
newman
i
like
it
all
the
same
she
looked
at
him
askance
that
is
a
very
pretty
thing
to
say
she
answered
but
it
is
my
duty
to
warn
you
before
you
go
farther
this
order
of
yours
is
impossible
you
know
what
do
you
take
me
for
it
is
work
for
ten
men
you
pick
out
the
six
most
difficult
pictures
in
the
louvre
and
you
expect
me
to
go
to
work
as
if
i
were
sitting
down
to
hem
a
dozen
pocket
handkerchiefs
i
wanted
to
see
how
far
you
would
newman
looked
at
the
young
girl
in
some
perplexity
in
spite
of
the
ridiculous
blunder
of
which
he
stood
convicted
he
was
very
far
from
being
a
simpleton
and
he
had
a
lively
suspicion
that
mademoiselle
noémie
s
sudden
frankness
was
not
essentially
more
honest
than
her
leaving
him
in
error
would
have
been
she
was
playing
a
game
she
was
not
simply
taking
pity
on
his
æsthetic
verdancy
what
was
it
she
expected
to
win
the
stakes
were
high
and
the
risk
was
great
the
prize
therefore
must
have
been
commensurate
but
even
granting
that
the
prize
might
be
great
newman
could
not
resist
a
movement
of
admiration
for
his
companion
s
intrepidity
she
was
throwing
away
with
one
hand
whatever
she
might
intend
to
do
with
the
other
a
very
handsome
sum
of
money
are
you
joking
he
said
or
are
you
serious
oh
serious
cried
mademoiselle
noémie
but
with
her
extraordinary
smile
i
know
very
little
about
pictures
or
how
they
are
painted
if
you
can
t
do
all
that
of
course
you
can
t
do
what
you
can
it
will
be
very
bad
said
mademoiselle
noémie
oh
said
newman
laughing
if
you
are
determined
it
shall
be
bad
of
course
it
will
but
why
do
you
go
on
painting
badly
i
can
do
nothing
else
i
have
no
real
you
are
deceiving
your
father
the
young
girl
hesitated
a
moment
he
knows
very
well
no
newman
declared
i
am
sure
he
believes
in
he
is
afraid
of
me
i
go
on
painting
badly
as
you
say
because
i
want
to
learn
i
like
it
at
any
rate
and
i
like
being
here
it
is
a
place
to
come
to
every
day
it
is
better
than
sitting
in
a
little
dark
damp
room
on
a
court
or
selling
buttons
and
whalebones
over
a
of
course
it
is
much
more
amusing
said
newman
but
for
a
poor
girl
isn
t
it
rather
an
expensive
amusement
oh
i
am
very
wrong
there
is
no
doubt
about
that
said
mademoiselle
noémie
but
rather
than
earn
my
living
as
some
girls
do
toiling
with
a
needle
in
little
black
holes
out
of
the
world
i
would
throw
myself
into
the
there
is
no
need
of
that
newman
answered
your
father
told
you
my
offer
your
offer
he
wants
you
to
marry
and
i
told
him
i
would
give
you
a
chance
to
earn
your
he
told
me
all
about
it
and
you
see
the
account
i
make
of
it
why
should
you
take
such
an
interest
in
my
marriage
my
interest
was
in
your
father
i
hold
to
my
offer
do
what
you
can
and
i
will
buy
what
you
she
stood
for
some
time
meditating
with
her
eyes
on
the
ground
at
last
looking
up
what
sort
of
a
husband
can
you
get
for
twelve
thousand
francs
she
asked
your
father
tells
me
he
knows
some
very
good
young
grocers
and
butchers
and
little
de
cafés
i
will
not
marry
at
all
if
i
can
t
marry
i
would
advise
you
not
to
be
too
fastidious
said
newman
that
s
all
the
advice
i
can
give
i
am
very
much
vexed
at
what
i
have
said
cried
the
young
girl
it
has
done
me
no
good
but
i
couldn
t
help
what
good
did
you
expect
it
to
do
you
i
couldn
t
help
it
newman
looked
at
her
a
moment
well
your
pictures
may
be
bad
he
said
but
you
are
too
clever
for
me
nevertheless
i
don
t
understand
you
and
he
put
out
his
hand
she
made
no
response
and
offered
him
no
farewell
she
turned
away
and
seated
herself
sidewise
on
a
bench
leaning
her
head
on
the
back
of
her
hand
which
clasped
the
rail
in
front
of
the
pictures
newman
stood
a
moment
and
then
turned
on
his
heel
and
retreated
he
had
understood
her
better
than
he
confessed
this
singular
scene
was
a
practical
commentary
upon
her
father
s
statement
that
she
was
a
frank
coquette
chapter
v
when
newman
related
to
tristram
his
fruitless
visit
to
madame
de
cintré
she
urged
him
not
to
be
discouraged
but
to
carry
out
his
plan
of
seeing
europe
during
the
summer
and
return
to
paris
in
the
autumn
and
settle
down
comfortably
for
the
winter
madame
de
cintré
will
keep
she
said
she
is
not
a
woman
who
will
marry
from
one
day
to
newman
made
no
distinct
affirmation
that
he
would
come
back
to
paris
he
even
talked
about
rome
and
the
nile
and
abstained
from
professing
any
especial
interest
in
madame
de
cintré
s
continued
widowhood
this
circumstance
was
at
variance
with
his
habitual
frankness
and
may
perhaps
be
regarded
as
characteristic
of
the
incipient
stage
of
that
passion
which
is
more
particularly
known
as
the
mysterious
one
the
truth
is
that
the
expression
of
a
pair
of
eyes
that
were
at
once
brilliant
and
mild
had
become
very
familiar
to
his
memory
and
he
would
not
easily
have
resigned
himself
to
the
prospect
of
never
looking
into
them
again
he
communicated
to
tristram
a
number
of
other
facts
of
greater
or
less
importance
as
you
choose
but
on
this
particular
point
he
kept
his
own
counsel
he
took
a
kindly
leave
of
nioche
having
assured
him
that
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
the
madonna
herself
might
have
been
present
at
his
interview
with
mademoiselle
noémie
and
left
the
old
man
nursing
his
in
an
ecstasy
which
the
acutest
misfortune
might
have
been
defied
to
dissipate
newman
then
started
on
his
travels
with
all
his
usual
appearance
of
leisure
and
all
his
essential
directness
and
intensity
of
aim
no
man
seemed
less
in
a
hurry
and
yet
no
man
achieved
more
in
brief
periods
he
had
certain
practical
instincts
which
served
him
excellently
in
his
trade
of
tourist
he
found
his
way
in
foreign
cities
by
divination
his
memory
was
excellent
when
once
his
attention
had
been
at
all
cordially
given
and
he
emerged
from
dialogues
in
foreign
tongues
of
which
he
had
formally
not
understood
a
word
in
full
possession
of
the
particular
fact
he
had
desired
to
ascertain
his
appetite
for
facts
was
capacious
and
although
many
of
those
which
he
noted
would
have
seemed
woefully
dry
and
colorless
to
the
ordinary
sentimental
traveler
a
careful
inspection
of
the
list
would
have
shown
that
he
had
a
soft
spot
in
his
imagination
in
the
charming
city
of
brussels
his
first
after
leaving
paris
he
asked
a
great
many
questions
about
the
and
took
extreme
satisfaction
in
the
reappearance
of
this
familiar
symbol
of
american
civilization
but
he
was
also
greatly
struck
with
the
beautiful
gothic
tower
of
the
hôtel
de
ville
and
wondered
whether
it
would
not
be
possible
to
get
up
something
like
it
in
san
francisco
he
stood
for
half
an
hour
in
the
crowded
square
before
this
edifice
in
imminent
danger
from
listening
to
a
toothless
old
cicerone
mumble
in
broken
english
the
touching
history
of
counts
egmont
and
horn
and
he
wrote
the
names
of
these
gentlemen
for
reasons
best
known
to
himself
on
the
back
of
an
old
letter
at
the
outset
on
his
leaving
paris
his
curiosity
had
not
been
intense
passive
entertainment
in
the
champs
élysées
and
at
the
theatres
seemed
about
as
much
as
he
need
expect
of
himself
and
although
as
he
had
said
to
tristram
he
wanted
to
see
the
mysterious
satisfying
he
had
not
the
grand
tour
in
the
least
on
his
conscience
and
was
not
given
to
the
amusement
of
the
hour
he
believed
that
europe
was
made
for
him
and
not
he
for
europe
he
had
said
that
he
wanted
to
improve
his
mind
but
he
would
have
felt
a
certain
embarrassment
a
certain
shame
even
a
false
shame
possibly
if
he
had
caught
himself
looking
intellectually
into
the
mirror
neither
in
this
nor
in
any
other
respect
had
newman
a
high
sense
of
responsibility
it
was
his
prime
conviction
that
a
man
s
life
should
be
easy
and
that
he
should
be
able
to
resolve
privilege
into
a
matter
of
course
the
world
to
his
sense
was
a
great
bazaar
where
one
might
stroll
about
and
purchase
handsome
things
but
he
was
no
more
conscious
individually
of
social
pressure
than
he
admitted
the
existence
of
such
a
thing
as
an
obligatory
purchase
he
had
not
only
a
dislike
but
a
sort
of
moral
mistrust
of
uncomfortable
thoughts
and
it
was
both
uncomfortable
and
slightly
contemptible
to
feel
obliged
to
square
one
s
self
with
a
standard
one
s
standard
was
the
ideal
of
one
s
own
prosperity
the
prosperity
which
enabled
one
to
give
as
well
as
take
to
expand
without
bothering
about
it
without
shiftless
timidity
on
one
side
or
loquacious
eagerness
on
the
other
to
the
full
compass
of
what
he
would
have
called
a
pleasant
experience
was
newman
s
most
definite
programme
of
life
he
had
always
hated
to
hurry
to
catch
railroad
trains
and
yet
he
had
always
caught
them
and
just
so
an
undue
solicitude
for
culture
seemed
a
sort
of
silly
dawdling
at
the
station
a
proceeding
properly
confined
to
women
foreigners
and
other
unpractical
persons
all
this
admitted
newman
enjoyed
his
journey
when
once
he
had
fairly
entered
the
current
as
profoundly
as
the
most
zealous
one
s
theories
after
all
matter
little
it
is
one
s
humor
that
is
the
great
thing
our
friend
was
intelligent
and
he
could
not
help
that
he
lounged
through
belgium
and
holland
and
the
rhineland
through
switzerland
and
northern
italy
planning
about
nothing
but
seeing
everything
the
guides
and
de
found
him
an
excellent
subject
he
was
always
approachable
for
he
was
much
addicted
to
standing
about
in
the
vestibules
and
porticos
of
inns
and
he
availed
himself
little
of
the
opportunities
for
impressive
seclusion
which
are
so
liberally
offered
in
europe
to
gentlemen
who
travel
with
long
purses
when
an
excursion
a
church
a
gallery
a
ruin
was
proposed
to
him
the
first
thing
newman
usually
did
after
surveying
his
postulant
in
silence
from
head
to
foot
was
to
sit
down
at
a
little
table
and
order
something
to
drink
the
cicerone
during
this
process
usually
retreated
to
a
respectful
distance
otherwise
i
am
not
sure
that
newman
would
not
have
bidden
him
sit
down
and
have
a
glass
also
and
tell
him
as
an
honest
fellow
whether
his
church
or
his
gallery
was
really
worth
a
man
s
trouble
at
last
he
rose
and
stretched
his
long
legs
beckoned
to
the
man
of
monuments
looked
at
his
watch
and
fixed
his
eye
on
his
adversary
what
is
it
he
asked
how
far
and
whatever
the
answer
was
although
he
sometimes
seemed
to
hesitate
he
never
declined
he
stepped
into
an
open
cab
made
his
conductor
sit
beside
him
to
answer
questions
bade
the
driver
go
fast
he
had
a
particular
aversion
to
slow
driving
and
rolled
in
all
probability
through
a
dusty
suburb
to
the
goal
of
his
pilgrimage
if
the
goal
was
a
disappointment
if
the
church
was
meagre
or
the
ruin
a
heap
of
rubbish
newman
never
protested
or
berated
his
cicerone
he
looked
with
an
impartial
eye
upon
great
monuments
and
small
made
the
guide
recite
his
lesson
listened
to
it
religiously
asked
if
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
seen
in
the
neighborhood
and
drove
back
again
at
a
rattling
pace
it
is
to
be
feared
that
his
perception
of
the
difference
between
good
architecture
and
bad
was
not
acute
and
that
he
might
sometimes
have
been
seen
gazing
with
culpable
serenity
at
inferior
productions
ugly
churches
were
a
part
of
his
pastime
in
europe
as
well
as
beautiful
ones
and
his
tour
was
altogether
a
pastime
but
there
is
sometimes
nothing
like
the
imagination
of
these
people
who
have
none
and
newman
now
and
then
in
an
unguided
stroll
in
a
foreign
city
before
some
lonely
church
or
some
angular
image
of
one
who
had
rendered
civic
service
in
an
unknown
past
had
felt
a
singular
inward
tremor
it
was
not
an
excitement
or
a
perplexity
it
was
a
placid
fathomless
sense
of
diversion
he
encountered
by
chance
in
holland
a
young
american
with
whom
for
a
time
he
formed
a
sort
of
traveler
s
partnership
they
were
men
of
a
very
different
cast
but
each
in
his
way
was
so
good
a
fellow
that
for
a
few
weeks
at
least
it
seemed
something
of
a
pleasure
to
share
the
chances
of
the
road
newman
s
comrade
whose
name
was
babcock
was
a
young
unitarian
minister
a
small
spare
man
with
a
strikingly
candid
physiognomy
he
was
a
native
of
dorchester
massachusetts
and
had
spiritual
charge
of
a
small
congregation
in
another
suburb
of
the
new
england
metropolis
his
digestion
was
weak
and
he
lived
chiefly
on
graham
bread
and
hominy
a
regimen
to
which
he
was
so
much
attached
that
his
tour
seemed
to
him
destined
to
be
blighted
when
on
landing
on
the
continent
he
found
that
these
delicacies
did
not
flourish
under
the
d
system
in
paris
he
had
purchased
a
bag
of
hominy
at
an
establishment
which
called
itself
an
american
agency
and
at
which
the
new
york
illustrated
papers
were
also
to
be
procured
and
he
had
carried
it
about
with
him
and
shown
extreme
serenity
and
fortitude
in
the
somewhat
delicate
position
of
having
his
hominy
prepared
for
him
and
served
at
anomalous
hours
at
the
hotels
he
successively
visited
newman
had
once
spent
a
morning
in
the
course
of
business
at
babcock
s
birthplace
and
for
reasons
too
recondite
to
unfold
his
visit
there
always
assumed
in
his
mind
a
jocular
cast
to
carry
out
his
joke
which
certainly
seems
poor
so
long
as
it
is
not
explained
he
used
often
to
address
his
companion
as
very
soon
grow
intimate
but
it
is
highly
improbable
that
at
home
these
extremely
dissimilar
characters
would
have
found
any
very
convenient
points
of
contact
they
were
indeed
as
different
as
possible
newman
who
never
reflected
on
such
matters
accepted
the
situation
with
great
equanimity
but
babcock
used
to
meditate
over
it
privately
used
often
indeed
to
retire
to
his
room
early
in
the
evening
for
the
express
purpose
of
considering
it
conscientiously
and
impartially
he
was
not
sure
that
it
was
a
good
thing
for
him
to
associate
with
our
hero
whose
way
of
taking
life
was
so
little
his
own
newman
was
an
excellent
generous
fellow
babcock
sometimes
said
to
himself
that
he
was
a
fellow
and
certainly
it
was
impossible
not
to
like
him
but
would
it
not
be
desirable
to
try
to
exert
an
influence
upon
him
to
try
to
quicken
his
moral
life
and
sharpen
his
sense
of
duty
he
liked
everything
he
accepted
everything
he
found
amusement
in
everything
he
was
not
discriminating
he
had
not
a
high
tone
the
young
man
from
dorchester
accused
newman
of
a
fault
which
he
considered
very
grave
and
which
he
did
his
best
to
avoid
what
he
would
have
called
a
want
of
moral
poor
babcock
was
extremely
fond
of
pictures
and
churches
and
carried
jameson
s
works
about
in
his
trunk
he
delighted
in
æsthetic
analysis
and
received
peculiar
impressions
from
everything
he
saw
but
nevertheless
in
his
secret
soul
he
detested
europe
and
he
felt
an
irritating
need
to
protest
against
newman
s
gross
intellectual
hospitality
babcock
s
moral
i
am
afraid
lay
deeper
than
where
any
definition
of
mine
can
reach
it
he
mistrusted
the
european
temperament
he
suffered
from
the
european
climate
he
hated
the
european
european
life
seemed
to
him
unscrupulous
and
impure
and
yet
he
had
an
exquisite
sense
of
beauty
and
as
beauty
was
often
inextricably
associated
with
the
above
displeasing
conditions
as
he
wished
above
all
to
be
just
and
dispassionate
and
as
he
was
furthermore
extremely
devoted
to
culture
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
decide
that
europe
was
utterly
bad
but
he
thought
it
was
very
bad
indeed
and
his
quarrel
with
newman
was
that
this
unregulated
epicure
had
a
sadly
insufficient
perception
of
the
bad
babcock
himself
really
knew
as
little
about
the
bad
in
any
quarter
of
the
world
as
a
nursing
infant
his
most
vivid
realization
of
evil
had
been
the
discovery
that
one
of
his
college
classmates
who
was
studying
architecture
in
paris
had
a
love
affair
with
a
young
woman
who
did
not
expect
him
to
marry
her
babcock
had
related
this
incident
to
newman
and
our
hero
had
applied
an
epithet
of
an
unflattering
sort
to
the
young
girl
the
next
day
his
companion
asked
him
whether
he
was
very
sure
he
had
used
exactly
the
right
word
to
characterize
the
young
architect
s
mistress
newman
stared
and
laughed
there
are
a
great
many
words
to
express
that
idea
he
said
you
can
take
your
choice
oh
i
mean
said
babcock
was
she
possibly
not
to
be
considered
in
a
different
light
don
t
you
think
she
expected
him
to
marry
her
i
am
sure
i
don
t
know
said
newman
very
likely
she
did
i
have
no
doubt
she
is
a
grand
and
he
began
to
laugh
again
i
didn
t
mean
that
either
said
babcock
i
was
only
afraid
that
i
might
have
seemed
yesterday
not
to
remember
not
to
consider
well
i
think
i
will
write
to
percival
about
and
he
had
written
to
percival
who
answered
him
in
a
really
impudent
fashion
and
he
had
reflected
that
it
was
somehow
raw
and
reckless
in
newman
to
assume
in
that
manner
that
the
young
woman
in
paris
might
be
the
brevity
of
newman
s
judgments
very
often
shocked
and
discomposed
him
he
had
a
way
of
damning
people
without
farther
appeal
or
of
pronouncing
them
capital
company
in
the
face
of
uncomfortable
symptoms
which
seemed
unworthy
of
a
man
whose
conscience
had
been
properly
cultivated
and
yet
poor
babcock
liked
him
and
remembered
that
even
if
he
was
sometimes
perplexing
and
painful
this
was
not
a
reason
for
giving
him
up
goethe
recommended
seeing
human
nature
in
the
most
various
forms
and
babcock
thought
goethe
perfectly
splendid
he
often
tried
in
odd
of
conversation
to
infuse
into
newman
a
little
of
his
own
spiritual
starch
but
newman
s
personal
texture
was
too
loose
to
admit
of
stiffening
his
mind
could
no
more
hold
principles
than
a
sieve
can
hold
water
he
admired
principles
extremely
and
thought
babcock
a
mighty
fine
little
fellow
for
having
so
many
he
accepted
all
that
his
companion
offered
him
and
put
them
away
in
what
he
supposed
to
be
a
very
safe
place
but
poor
babcock
never
afterwards
recognized
his
gifts
among
the
articles
that
newman
had
in
daily
use
they
traveled
together
through
germany
and
into
switzerland
where
for
three
or
four
weeks
they
trudged
over
passes
and
lounged
upon
blue
lakes
at
last
they
crossed
the
simplon
and
made
their
way
to
venice
babcock
had
become
gloomy
and
even
a
trifle
irritable
he
seemed
moody
absent
preoccupied
he
got
his
plans
into
a
tangle
and
talked
one
moment
of
doing
one
thing
and
the
next
of
doing
another
newman
led
his
usual
life
made
acquaintances
took
his
ease
in
the
galleries
and
churches
spent
an
unconscionable
amount
of
time
in
strolling
in
the
piazza
san
marco
bought
a
great
many
bad
pictures
and
for
a
fortnight
enjoyed
venice
grossly
one
evening
coming
back
to
his
inn
he
found
babcock
waiting
for
him
in
the
little
garden
beside
it
the
young
man
walked
up
to
him
looking
very
dismal
thrust
out
his
hand
and
said
with
solemnity
that
he
was
afraid
they
must
part
newman
expressed
his
surprise
and
regret
and
asked
why
a
parting
had
become
necessary
don
t
be
afraid
i
m
tired
of
you
he
said
you
are
not
tired
of
me
demanded
babcock
fixing
him
with
his
clear
gray
eye
why
the
deuce
should
i
be
you
are
a
very
plucky
fellow
besides
i
don
t
grow
tired
of
we
don
t
understand
each
other
said
the
young
minister
don
t
i
understand
you
cried
newman
why
i
hoped
i
did
but
what
if
i
don
t
where
s
the
harm
i
don
t
understand
said
babcock
and
he
sat
down
and
rested
his
head
on
his
hand
and
looked
up
mournfully
at
his
immeasurable
friend
oh
lord
i
don
t
mind
that
cried
newman
with
a
laugh
but
it
s
very
distressing
to
me
it
keeps
me
in
a
state
of
unrest
it
irritates
me
i
can
t
settle
anything
i
don
t
think
it
s
good
for
you
worry
too
much
that
s
what
s
the
matter
with
you
said
newman
of
course
it
must
seem
so
to
you
you
think
i
take
things
too
hard
and
i
think
you
take
things
too
easily
we
can
never
but
we
have
agreed
very
well
all
no
i
haven
t
agreed
said
babcock
shaking
his
head
i
am
very
uncomfortable
i
ought
to
have
separated
from
you
a
month
oh
horrors
i
ll
agree
to
anything
cried
newman
babcock
buried
his
head
in
both
hands
at
last
looking
up
i
don
t
think
you
appreciate
my
position
he
said
i
try
to
arrive
at
the
truth
about
everything
and
then
you
go
too
fast
for
me
you
are
too
passionate
too
extravagant
i
feel
as
if
i
ought
to
go
over
all
this
ground
we
have
traversed
again
by
myself
alone
i
am
afraid
i
have
made
a
great
many
oh
you
needn
t
give
so
many
reasons
said
newman
you
are
simply
tired
of
my
company
you
have
a
good
right
to
no
no
i
am
not
tired
cried
the
pestered
young
divine
it
is
very
wrong
to
be
i
give
it
up
laughed
newman
but
of
course
it
will
never
do
to
go
on
making
mistakes
go
your
way
by
all
means
i
shall
miss
you
but
you
have
seen
i
make
friends
very
easily
you
will
be
lonely
yourself
but
drop
me
a
line
when
you
feel
like
it
and
i
will
wait
for
you
i
think
i
will
go
back
to
milan
i
am
afraid
i
didn
t
do
justice
to
poor
luini
said
newman
i
mean
that
i
am
afraid
i
overestimated
him
i
don
t
think
that
he
is
a
painter
of
the
first
luini
newman
exclaimed
why
he
s
enchanting
he
s
magnificent
there
is
something
in
his
genius
that
is
like
a
beautiful
woman
it
gives
one
the
same
babcock
frowned
and
winced
and
it
must
be
added
that
this
was
for
newman
an
unusually
metaphysical
flight
but
in
passing
through
milan
he
had
taken
a
great
fancy
to
the
painter
there
you
are
again
said
babcock
yes
we
had
better
and
on
the
morrow
he
retraced
his
steps
and
proceeded
to
tone
down
his
impressions
of
the
great
lombard
artist
a
few
days
afterwards
newman
received
a
note
from
his
late
companion
which
ran
as
follows
my
dear
newman
i
am
afraid
that
my
conduct
at
venice
a
week
ago
seemed
to
you
strange
and
ungrateful
and
i
wish
to
explain
my
position
which
as
i
said
at
the
time
i
do
not
think
you
appreciate
i
had
long
had
it
on
my
mind
to
propose
that
we
should
part
company
and
this
step
was
not
really
so
abrupt
as
it
seemed
in
the
first
place
you
know
i
am
traveling
in
europe
on
funds
supplied
by
my
congregation
who
kindly
offered
me
a
vacation
and
an
opportunity
to
enrich
my
mind
with
the
treasures
of
nature
and
art
in
the
old
world
i
feel
therefore
as
if
i
ought
to
use
my
time
to
the
very
best
advantage
i
have
a
high
sense
of
responsibility
you
appear
to
care
only
for
the
pleasure
of
the
hour
and
you
give
yourself
up
to
it
with
a
violence
which
i
confess
i
am
not
able
to
emulate
i
feel
as
if
i
must
arrive
at
some
conclusion
and
fix
my
belief
on
certain
points
art
and
life
seem
to
me
intensely
serious
things
and
in
our
travels
in
europe
we
should
especially
remember
the
immense
seriousness
of
art
you
seem
to
hold
that
if
a
thing
amuses
you
for
the
moment
that
is
all
you
need
ask
for
it
and
your
relish
for
mere
amusement
is
also
much
higher
than
mine
you
put
however
a
kind
of
reckless
confidence
into
your
pleasure
which
at
times
i
confess
has
seemed
to
me
shall
i
say
it
almost
cynical
your
way
at
any
rate
is
not
my
way
and
it
is
unwise
that
we
should
attempt
any
longer
to
pull
together
and
yet
let
me
add
that
i
know
there
is
a
great
deal
to
be
said
for
your
way
i
have
felt
its
attraction
in
your
society
very
strongly
but
for
this
i
should
have
left
you
long
ago
but
i
was
so
perplexed
i
hope
i
have
not
done
wrong
i
feel
as
if
i
had
a
great
deal
of
lost
time
to
make
up
i
beg
you
take
all
this
as
i
mean
it
which
heaven
knows
is
not
invidiously
i
have
a
great
personal
esteem
for
you
and
hope
that
some
day
when
i
have
recovered
my
balance
we
shall
meet
again
i
hope
you
will
continue
to
enjoy
your
travels
only
remember
that
life
and
art
extremely
serious
believe
me
your
sincere
friend
and
benjamin
babcock
i
am
greatly
perplexed
by
luini
this
letter
produced
in
newman
s
mind
a
singular
mixture
of
exhilaration
and
awe
at
first
babcock
s
tender
conscience
seemed
to
him
a
capital
farce
and
his
traveling
back
to
milan
only
to
get
into
a
deeper
muddle
appeared
as
the
reward
of
his
pedantry
exquisitely
and
ludicrously
just
then
newman
reflected
that
these
are
mighty
mysteries
that
possibly
he
himself
was
indeed
that
baleful
and
barely
mentionable
thing
a
cynic
and
that
his
manner
of
considering
the
treasures
of
art
and
the
privileges
of
life
was
probably
very
base
and
immoral
newman
had
a
great
contempt
for
immorality
and
that
evening
for
a
good
half
hour
as
he
sat
watching
the
on
the
warm
adriatic
he
felt
rebuked
and
depressed
he
was
at
a
loss
how
to
answer
babcock
s
letter
his
good
nature
checked
his
resenting
the
young
minister
s
lofty
admonitions
and
his
tough
inelastic
sense
of
humor
forbade
his
taking
them
seriously
he
wrote
no
answer
at
all
but
a
day
or
two
afterward
he
found
in
a
curiosity
shop
a
grotesque
little
statuette
in
ivory
of
the
sixteenth
century
which
he
sent
off
to
babcock
without
a
commentary
it
represented
a
gaunt
monk
in
a
tattered
gown
and
cowl
kneeling
with
clasped
hands
and
pulling
a
portentously
long
face
it
was
a
wonderfully
delicate
piece
of
carving
and
in
a
moment
through
one
of
the
rents
of
his
gown
you
espied
a
fat
capon
hung
round
the
monk
s
waist
in
newman
s
intention
what
did
the
figure
symbolize
did
it
mean
that
he
was
going
to
try
to
be
as
as
the
monk
looked
at
first
but
that
he
feared
he
should
succeed
no
better
than
the
friar
on
a
closer
inspection
proved
to
have
done
it
is
not
supposable
that
he
intended
a
satire
upon
babcock
s
own
asceticism
for
this
would
have
been
a
truly
cynical
stroke
he
made
his
late
companion
at
any
rate
a
very
valuable
little
present
newman
on
leaving
venice
went
through
the
tyrol
to
vienna
and
then
returned
westward
through
southern
germany
the
autumn
found
him
at
where
he
spent
several
weeks
the
place
was
charming
and
he
was
in
no
hurry
to
depart
besides
he
was
looking
about
him
and
deciding
what
to
do
for
the
winter
his
summer
had
been
very
full
and
he
sat
under
the
great
trees
beside
the
miniature
river
that
trickles
past
the
baden
he
slowly
rummaged
it
over
he
had
seen
and
done
a
great
deal
enjoyed
and
observed
a
great
deal
he
felt
older
and
yet
he
felt
younger
too
he
remembered
babcock
and
his
desire
to
form
conclusions
and
he
remembered
also
that
he
had
profited
very
little
by
his
friend
s
exhortation
to
cultivate
the
same
respectable
habit
could
he
not
scrape
together
a
few
conclusions
was
the
prettiest
place
he
had
seen
yet
and
orchestral
music
in
the
evening
under
the
stars
was
decidedly
a
great
institution
this
was
one
of
his
conclusions
but
he
went
on
to
reflect
that
he
had
done
very
wisely
to
pull
up
stakes
and
come
abroad
this
seeing
of
the
world
was
a
very
interesting
thing
he
had
learned
a
great
deal
he
couldn
t
say
just
what
but
he
had
it
there
under
his
he
had
done
what
he
wanted
he
had
seen
the
great
things
and
he
had
given
his
mind
a
chance
to
improve
if
it
would
he
cheerfully
believed
that
it
had
improved
yes
this
seeing
of
the
world
was
very
pleasant
and
he
would
willingly
do
a
little
more
of
it
years
old
as
he
was
he
had
a
handsome
stretch
of
life
before
him
yet
and
he
need
not
begin
to
count
his
weeks
where
should
he
take
the
world
next
i
have
said
he
remembered
the
eyes
of
the
lady
whom
he
had
found
standing
in
tristram
s
four
months
had
elapsed
and
he
had
not
forgotten
them
yet
he
had
looked
he
had
made
a
point
of
looking
into
a
great
many
other
eyes
in
the
interval
but
the
only
ones
he
thought
of
now
were
madame
de
cintré
s
if
he
wanted
to
see
more
of
the
world
should
he
find
it
in
madame
de
cintré
s
eyes
he
would
certainly
find
something
there
call
it
this
world
or
the
next
throughout
these
rather
formless
meditations
he
sometimes
thought
of
his
past
life
and
the
long
array
of
years
they
had
begun
so
early
during
which
he
had
had
nothing
in
his
head
but
they
seemed
far
away
now
for
his
present
attitude
was
more
than
a
holiday
it
was
almost
a
rupture
he
had
told
tristram
that
the
pendulum
was
swinging
back
and
it
appeared
that
the
backward
swing
had
not
yet
ended
still
enterprise
which
was
over
in
the
other
quarter
wore
to
his
mind
a
different
aspect
at
different
hours
in
its
train
a
thousand
forgotten
episodes
came
trooping
back
into
his
memory
some
of
them
he
looked
complacently
enough
in
the
face
from
some
he
averted
his
head
they
were
old
efforts
old
exploits
antiquated
examples
of
smartness
and
sharpness
some
of
them
as
he
looked
at
them
he
felt
decidedly
proud
of
he
admired
himself
as
if
he
had
been
looking
at
another
man
and
in
fact
many
of
the
qualities
that
make
a
great
deed
were
there
the
decision
the
resolution
the
courage
the
celerity
the
clear
eye
and
the
strong
hand
of
certain
other
achievements
it
would
be
going
too
far
to
say
that
he
was
ashamed
of
them
for
newman
had
never
had
a
stomach
for
dirty
work
he
was
blessed
with
a
natural
impulse
to
disfigure
with
a
direct
unreasoning
blow
the
comely
visage
of
temptation
and
certainly
in
no
man
could
a
want
of
integrity
have
been
less
excusable
newman
knew
the
crooked
from
the
straight
at
a
glance
and
the
former
had
cost
him
first
and
last
a
great
many
moments
of
lively
disgust
but
none
the
less
some
of
his
memories
seemed
to
wear
at
present
a
rather
graceless
and
sordid
mien
and
it
struck
him
that
if
he
had
never
done
anything
very
ugly
he
had
never
on
the
other
hand
done
anything
particularly
beautiful
he
had
spent
his
years
in
the
unremitting
effort
to
add
thousands
to
thousands
and
now
that
he
stood
well
outside
of
it
the
business
of
appeared
tolerably
dry
and
sterile
it
is
very
well
to
sneer
at
after
you
have
filled
your
pockets
and
newman
it
may
be
said
should
have
begun
somewhat
earlier
to
moralize
thus
delicately
to
this
it
may
be
answered
that
he
might
have
made
another
fortune
if
he
chose
and
we
ought
to
add
that
he
was
not
exactly
moralizing
it
had
come
back
to
him
simply
that
what
he
had
been
looking
at
all
summer
was
a
very
rich
and
beautiful
world
and
that
it
had
not
all
been
made
by
sharp
railroad
men
and
during
his
stay
at
he
received
a
letter
from
tristram
scolding
him
for
the
scanty
tidings
he
had
sent
to
his
friends
of
the
avenue
d
iéna
and
begging
to
be
definitely
informed
that
he
had
not
concocted
any
horrid
scheme
for
wintering
in
outlying
regions
but
was
coming
back
sanely
and
promptly
to
the
most
comfortable
city
in
the
world
newman
s
answer
ran
as
follows
i
supposed
you
knew
i
was
a
miserable
and
didn
t
expect
anything
of
me
i
don
t
think
i
have
written
twenty
letters
of
pure
friendship
in
my
whole
life
in
america
i
conducted
my
correspondence
altogether
by
telegrams
this
is
a
letter
of
pure
friendship
you
have
got
hold
of
a
curiosity
and
i
hope
you
will
value
it
you
want
to
know
everything
that
has
happened
to
me
these
three
months
the
best
way
to
tell
you
i
think
would
be
to
send
you
my
half
dozen
with
my
in
the
margin
wherever
you
find
a
scratch
or
a
cross
or
a
beautiful
or
a
so
true
or
a
too
thin
you
may
know
that
i
have
had
a
sensation
of
some
sort
or
other
that
has
been
about
my
history
ever
since
i
left
you
belgium
holland
switzerland
germany
italy
i
have
been
through
the
whole
list
and
i
don
t
think
i
am
any
the
worse
for
it
i
know
more
about
madonnas
and
than
i
supposed
any
man
could
i
have
seen
some
very
pretty
things
and
shall
perhaps
talk
them
over
this
winter
by
your
fireside
you
see
my
face
is
not
altogether
set
against
paris
i
have
had
all
kinds
of
plans
and
visions
but
your
letter
has
blown
most
of
them
away
appétit
vient
en
says
the
french
proverb
and
i
find
that
the
more
i
see
of
the
world
the
more
i
want
to
see
now
that
i
am
in
the
shafts
why
shouldn
t
i
trot
to
the
end
of
the
course
sometimes
i
think
of
the
far
east
and
keep
rolling
the
names
of
eastern
cities
under
my
tongue
damascus
and
bagdad
medina
and
mecca
i
spent
a
week
last
month
in
the
company
of
a
returned
missionary
who
told
me
i
ought
to
be
ashamed
to
be
loafing
about
europe
when
there
are
such
big
things
to
be
seen
out
there
i
do
want
to
explore
but
i
think
i
would
rather
explore
over
in
the
rue
de
l
université
do
you
ever
hear
from
that
pretty
lady
if
you
can
get
her
to
promise
she
will
be
at
home
the
next
time
i
call
i
will
go
back
to
paris
straight
i
am
more
than
ever
in
the
state
of
mind
i
told
you
about
that
evening
i
want
a
wife
i
have
kept
an
eye
on
all
the
pretty
girls
i
have
come
across
this
summer
but
none
of
them
came
up
to
my
notion
or
anywhere
near
it
i
should
have
enjoyed
all
this
a
thousand
times
more
if
i
had
had
the
lady
just
mentioned
by
my
side
the
nearest
approach
to
her
was
a
unitarian
minister
from
boston
who
very
soon
demanded
a
separation
for
incompatibility
of
temper
he
told
me
i
was
immoral
a
devotee
of
art
for
art
whatever
that
is
all
of
which
greatly
afflicted
me
for
he
was
really
a
sweet
little
fellow
but
shortly
afterwards
i
met
an
englishman
with
whom
i
struck
up
an
acquaintance
which
at
first
seemed
to
promise
well
a
very
bright
man
who
writes
in
the
london
papers
and
knows
paris
nearly
as
well
as
tristram
we
knocked
about
for
a
week
together
but
he
very
soon
gave
me
up
in
disgust
i
was
too
virtuous
by
half
i
was
too
stern
a
moralist
he
told
me
in
a
friendly
way
that
i
was
cursed
with
a
conscience
that
i
judged
things
like
a
methodist
and
talked
about
them
like
an
old
lady
this
was
rather
bewildering
which
of
my
two
critics
was
i
to
believe
i
didn
t
worry
about
it
and
very
soon
made
up
my
mind
they
were
both
idiots
but
there
is
one
thing
in
which
no
one
will
ever
have
the
impudence
to
pretend
i
am
wrong
that
is
in
being
your
faithful
friend
c
chapter
vi
newman
gave
up
damascus
and
bagdad
and
returned
to
paris
before
the
autumn
was
over
he
established
himself
in
some
rooms
selected
for
him
by
tom
tristram
in
accordance
with
the
latter
s
estimate
of
what
he
called
his
social
position
when
newman
learned
that
his
social
position
was
to
be
taken
into
account
he
professed
himself
utterly
incompetent
and
begged
tristram
to
relieve
him
of
the
care
i
didn
t
know
i
had
a
social
position
he
said
and
if
i
have
i
haven
t
the
smallest
idea
what
it
is
isn
t
a
social
position
knowing
some
two
or
three
thousand
people
and
inviting
them
to
dinner
i
know
you
and
your
wife
and
little
old
nioche
who
gave
me
french
lessons
last
spring
can
i
invite
you
to
dinner
to
meet
each
other
if
i
can
you
must
come
that
is
not
very
grateful
to
me
said
tristram
who
introduced
you
last
year
to
every
creature
i
so
you
did
i
had
quite
forgotten
but
i
thought
you
wanted
me
to
forget
said
newman
with
that
tone
of
simple
deliberateness
which
frequently
marked
his
utterance
and
which
an
observer
would
not
have
known
whether
to
pronounce
a
somewhat
mysteriously
humorous
affection
of
ignorance
or
a
modest
aspiration
to
knowledge
you
told
me
you
disliked
them
ah
the
way
you
remember
what
i
say
is
at
least
very
flattering
but
in
future
added
tristram
pray
forget
all
the
wicked
things
and
remember
only
the
good
ones
it
will
be
easily
done
and
it
will
not
fatigue
your
memory
but
i
forewarn
you
that
if
you
trust
my
husband
to
pick
out
your
rooms
you
are
in
for
something
hideous
darling
cried
tristram
i
must
say
nothing
wicked
otherwise
i
should
use
stronger
what
do
you
think
she
would
say
newman
asked
tristram
if
she
really
tried
now
she
can
express
displeasure
volubly
in
two
or
three
languages
that
s
what
it
is
to
be
intellectual
it
gives
her
the
start
of
me
completely
for
i
can
t
swear
for
the
life
of
me
except
in
english
when
i
get
mad
i
have
to
fall
back
on
our
dear
old
mother
tongue
there
s
nothing
like
it
after
newman
declared
that
he
knew
nothing
about
tables
and
chairs
and
that
he
would
accept
in
the
way
of
a
lodging
with
his
eyes
shut
anything
that
tristram
should
offer
him
this
was
partly
veracity
on
our
hero
s
part
but
it
was
also
partly
charity
he
knew
that
to
pry
about
and
look
at
rooms
and
make
people
open
windows
and
poke
into
sofas
with
his
cane
and
gossip
with
landladies
and
ask
who
lived
above
and
who
below
he
knew
that
this
was
of
all
pastimes
the
dearest
to
tristram
s
heart
and
he
felt
the
more
disposed
to
put
it
in
his
way
as
he
was
conscious
that
as
regards
his
obliging
friend
he
had
suffered
the
warmth
of
ancient
somewhat
to
abate
besides
he
had
no
taste
for
upholstery
he
had
even
no
very
exquisite
sense
of
comfort
or
convenience
he
had
a
relish
for
luxury
and
splendor
but
it
was
satisfied
by
rather
gross
contrivances
he
scarcely
knew
a
hard
chair
from
a
soft
one
and
he
possessed
a
talent
for
stretching
his
legs
which
quite
dispensed
with
adventitious
facilities
his
idea
of
comfort
was
to
inhabit
very
large
rooms
have
a
great
many
of
them
and
be
conscious
of
their
possessing
a
number
of
patented
mechanical
devices
half
of
which
he
should
never
have
occasion
to
use
the
apartments
should
be
light
and
brilliant
and
lofty
he
had
once
said
that
he
liked
rooms
in
which
you
wanted
to
keep
your
hat
on
for
the
rest
he
was
satisfied
with
the
assurance
of
any
respectable
person
that
everything
was
tristram
accordingly
secured
for
him
an
apartment
to
which
this
epithet
might
be
lavishly
applied
it
was
situated
on
the
boulevard
haussmann
on
the
first
floor
and
consisted
of
a
series
of
rooms
gilded
from
floor
to
ceiling
a
foot
thick
draped
in
various
light
shades
of
satin
and
chiefly
furnished
with
mirrors
and
clocks
newman
thought
them
magnificent
thanked
tristram
heartily
immediately
took
possession
and
had
one
of
his
trunks
standing
for
three
months
in
his
one
day
tristram
told
him
that
her
beautiful
friend
madame
de
cintré
had
returned
from
the
country
that
she
had
met
her
three
days
before
coming
out
of
the
church
of
sulpice
she
herself
having
journeyed
to
that
distant
quarter
in
quest
of
an
obscure
of
whose
skill
she
had
heard
high
praise
and
how
were
those
eyes
newman
asked
those
eyes
were
red
with
weeping
if
you
please
said
tristram
she
had
been
to
it
doesn
t
tally
with
your
account
of
her
said
newman
that
she
should
have
sins
to
they
were
not
sins
they
were
how
do
you
know
that
she
asked
me
to
come
and
see
her
i
went
this
and
what
does
she
suffer
from
i
didn
t
ask
her
with
her
somehow
one
is
very
discreet
but
i
guessed
easily
enough
she
suffers
from
her
wicked
old
mother
and
her
grand
turk
of
a
brother
they
persecute
her
but
i
can
almost
forgive
them
because
as
i
told
you
she
is
a
saint
and
a
persecution
is
all
that
she
needs
to
bring
out
her
saintliness
and
make
her
that
s
a
comfortable
theory
for
her
i
hope
you
will
never
impart
it
to
the
old
folks
why
does
she
let
them
bully
her
is
she
not
her
own
mistress
legally
yes
i
suppose
but
morally
no
in
france
you
must
never
say
nay
to
your
mother
whatever
she
requires
of
you
she
may
be
the
most
abominable
old
woman
in
the
world
and
make
your
life
a
purgatory
but
after
all
she
is
and
you
have
no
right
to
judge
her
you
have
simply
to
obey
the
thing
has
a
fine
side
to
it
madame
de
cintré
bows
her
head
and
folds
her
can
t
she
at
least
make
her
brother
leave
off
her
brother
is
the
de
la
as
they
say
he
is
the
head
of
the
clan
with
those
people
the
family
is
everything
you
must
act
not
for
your
own
pleasure
but
for
the
advantage
of
the
i
wonder
what
family
would
like
me
to
do
exclaimed
tristram
i
wish
you
had
one
said
his
wife
but
what
do
they
want
to
get
out
of
that
poor
lady
newman
asked
another
marriage
they
are
not
rich
and
they
want
to
bring
more
money
into
the
there
s
your
chance
my
boy
said
tristram
and
madame
de
cintré
objects
newman
continued
she
has
been
sold
once
she
naturally
objects
to
being
sold
again
it
appears
that
the
first
time
they
made
rather
a
poor
bargain
de
cintré
left
a
scanty
and
to
whom
do
they
want
to
marry
her
now
i
thought
it
best
not
to
ask
but
you
may
be
sure
it
is
to
some
horrid
old
nabob
or
to
some
dissipated
little
there
s
tristram
as
large
as
life
cried
her
husband
observe
the
richness
of
her
imagination
she
has
not
a
single
question
it
s
vulgar
to
ask
questions
and
yet
she
knows
everything
she
has
the
history
of
madame
de
cintré
s
marriage
at
her
fingers
ends
she
has
seen
the
lovely
claire
on
her
knees
with
loosened
tresses
and
streaming
eyes
and
the
rest
of
them
standing
over
her
with
spikes
and
goads
and
irons
ready
to
come
down
on
her
if
she
refuses
the
tipsy
duke
the
simple
truth
is
that
they
made
a
fuss
about
her
milliner
s
bill
or
refused
her
an
newman
looked
from
tristram
to
his
wife
with
a
certain
mistrust
in
each
direction
do
you
really
mean
he
asked
of
tristram
that
your
friend
is
being
forced
into
an
unhappy
marriage
i
think
it
extremely
probable
those
people
are
very
capable
of
that
sort
of
it
is
like
something
in
a
play
said
newman
that
dark
old
house
over
there
looks
as
if
wicked
things
had
been
done
in
it
and
might
be
done
they
have
a
still
darker
old
house
in
the
country
madame
de
cintré
tells
me
and
there
during
the
summer
this
scheme
must
have
been
have
been
mind
that
said
tristram
after
all
suggested
newman
after
a
silence
she
may
be
in
trouble
about
something
if
it
is
something
else
then
it
is
something
worse
said
tristram
with
rich
decision
newman
was
silent
a
while
and
seemed
lost
in
meditation
is
it
possible
he
asked
at
last
that
they
do
that
sort
of
thing
over
here
that
helpless
women
are
bullied
into
marrying
men
they
hate
helpless
women
all
over
the
world
have
a
hard
time
of
it
said
tristram
there
is
plenty
of
bullying
a
great
deal
of
that
kind
of
thing
goes
on
in
new
york
said
tristram
girls
are
bullied
or
coaxed
or
bribed
or
all
three
together
into
marrying
nasty
fellows
there
is
no
end
of
that
always
going
on
in
the
fifth
avenue
and
other
bad
things
besides
the
mysteries
of
the
fifth
avenue
someone
ought
to
show
them
i
don
t
believe
it
said
newman
very
gravely
i
don
t
believe
that
in
america
girls
are
ever
subjected
to
compulsion
i
don
t
believe
there
have
been
a
dozen
cases
of
it
since
the
country
listen
to
the
voice
of
the
spread
eagle
cried
tristram
the
spread
eagle
ought
to
use
his
wings
said
tristram
fly
to
the
rescue
of
madame
de
cintré
to
her
rescue
pounce
down
seize
her
in
your
talons
and
carry
her
off
marry
her
newman
for
some
moments
answered
nothing
but
presently
i
should
suppose
she
had
heard
enough
of
marrying
he
said
the
kindest
way
to
treat
her
would
be
to
admire
her
and
yet
never
to
speak
of
it
but
that
sort
of
thing
is
infamous
he
added
it
makes
me
feel
savage
to
hear
of
he
heard
of
it
however
more
than
once
afterward
tristram
again
saw
madame
de
cintré
and
again
found
her
looking
very
sad
but
on
these
occasions
there
had
been
no
tears
her
beautiful
eyes
were
clear
and
still
she
is
cold
calm
and
hopeless
tristram
declared
and
she
added
that
on
her
mentioning
that
her
friend
newman
was
again
in
paris
and
was
faithful
in
his
desire
to
make
madame
de
cintré
s
acquaintance
this
lovely
woman
had
found
a
smile
in
her
despair
and
declared
that
she
was
sorry
to
have
missed
his
visit
in
the
spring
and
that
she
hoped
he
had
not
lost
courage
i
told
her
something
about
you
said
tristram
that
s
a
comfort
said
newman
placidly
i
like
people
to
know
about
a
few
days
after
this
one
dusky
autumn
afternoon
he
went
again
to
the
rue
de
l
université
the
early
evening
had
closed
in
as
he
applied
for
admittance
at
the
stoutly
guarded
de
he
was
told
that
madame
de
cintré
was
at
home
he
crossed
the
court
entered
the
farther
door
and
was
conducted
through
a
vestibule
vast
dim
and
cold
up
a
broad
stone
staircase
with
an
ancient
iron
balustrade
to
an
apartment
on
the
second
floor
announced
and
ushered
in
he
found
himself
in
a
sort
of
paneled
boudoir
at
one
end
of
which
a
lady
and
gentleman
were
seated
before
the
fire
the
gentleman
was
smoking
a
cigarette
there
was
no
light
in
the
room
save
that
of
a
couple
of
candles
and
the
glow
from
the
hearth
both
persons
rose
to
welcome
newman
who
in
the
firelight
recognized
madame
de
cintré
she
gave
him
her
hand
with
a
smile
which
seemed
in
itself
an
illumination
and
pointing
to
her
companion
said
softly
my
the
gentleman
offered
newman
a
frank
friendly
greeting
and
our
hero
then
perceived
him
to
be
the
young
man
who
had
spoken
to
him
in
the
court
of
the
hotel
on
his
former
visit
and
who
had
struck
him
as
a
good
fellow
mrs
tristram
has
spoken
to
me
a
great
deal
of
you
said
madame
de
cintré
gently
as
she
resumed
her
former
place
newman
after
he
had
seated
himself
began
to
consider
what
in
truth
was
his
errand
he
had
an
unusual
unexpected
sense
of
having
wandered
into
a
strange
corner
of
the
world
he
was
not
given
as
a
general
thing
to
anticipating
danger
or
forecasting
disaster
and
he
had
had
no
social
tremors
on
this
particular
occasion
he
was
not
timid
and
he
was
not
impudent
he
felt
too
kindly
toward
himself
to
be
the
one
and
too
toward
the
rest
of
the
world
to
be
the
other
but
his
native
shrewdness
sometimes
placed
his
ease
of
temper
at
its
mercy
with
every
disposition
to
take
things
simply
it
was
obliged
to
perceive
that
some
things
were
not
so
simple
as
others
he
felt
as
one
does
in
missing
a
step
in
an
ascent
where
one
expected
to
find
it
this
strange
pretty
woman
sitting
in
talk
with
her
brother
in
the
gray
depths
of
her
house
what
had
he
to
say
to
her
she
seemed
enveloped
in
a
sort
of
fantastic
privacy
on
what
grounds
had
he
pulled
away
the
curtain
for
a
moment
he
felt
as
if
he
had
plunged
into
some
medium
as
deep
as
the
ocean
and
as
if
he
must
exert
himself
to
keep
from
sinking
meanwhile
he
was
looking
at
madame
de
cintré
and
she
was
settling
herself
in
her
chair
and
drawing
in
her
long
dress
and
turning
her
face
towards
him
their
eyes
met
a
moment
afterwards
she
looked
away
and
motioned
to
her
brother
to
put
a
log
on
the
fire
but
the
moment
and
the
glance
which
traversed
it
had
been
sufficient
to
relieve
newman
of
the
first
and
the
last
fit
of
personal
embarrassment
he
was
ever
to
know
he
performed
the
movement
which
was
so
frequent
with
him
and
which
was
always
a
sort
of
symbol
of
his
taking
mental
possession
of
a
scene
he
extended
his
legs
the
impression
madame
de
cintré
had
made
upon
him
on
their
first
meeting
came
back
in
an
instant
it
had
been
deeper
than
he
knew
she
was
pleasing
she
was
interesting
he
had
opened
a
book
and
the
first
lines
held
his
attention
she
asked
him
several
questions
how
lately
he
had
seen
tristram
how
long
he
had
been
in
paris
how
long
he
expected
to
remain
there
how
he
liked
it
she
spoke
english
without
an
accent
or
rather
with
that
distinctively
british
accent
which
on
his
arrival
in
europe
had
struck
newman
as
an
altogether
foreign
tongue
but
which
in
women
he
had
come
to
like
extremely
here
and
there
madame
de
cintré
s
utterance
had
a
faint
shade
of
strangeness
but
at
the
end
of
ten
minutes
newman
found
himself
waiting
for
these
soft
roughnesses
he
enjoyed
them
and
he
marveled
to
see
that
gross
thing
error
brought
down
to
so
fine
a
point
you
have
a
beautiful
country
said
madame
de
cintré
presently
oh
magnificent
said
newman
you
ought
to
see
i
shall
never
see
it
said
madame
de
cintré
with
a
smile
why
not
asked
newman
i
don
t
travel
especially
so
but
you
go
away
sometimes
you
are
not
always
here
i
go
away
in
summer
a
little
way
to
the
newman
wanted
to
ask
her
something
more
something
personal
he
hardly
knew
what
don
t
you
find
it
rather
rather
quiet
here
he
said
so
far
from
the
street
rather
gloomy
he
was
going
to
say
but
he
reflected
that
that
would
be
impolite
yes
it
is
very
quiet
said
madame
de
cintré
but
we
like
ah
you
like
that
repeated
newman
slowly
besides
i
have
lived
here
all
my
lived
here
all
your
life
said
newman
in
the
same
way
i
was
born
here
and
my
father
was
born
here
before
me
and
my
grandfather
and
my
were
they
not
valentin
and
she
appealed
to
her
brother
yes
it
s
a
family
habit
to
be
born
here
the
young
man
said
with
a
laugh
and
rose
and
threw
the
remnant
of
his
cigarette
into
the
fire
and
then
remained
leaning
against
the
an
observer
would
have
perceived
that
he
wished
to
take
a
better
look
at
newman
whom
he
covertly
examined
while
he
stood
stroking
his
moustache
your
house
is
tremendously
old
then
said
newman
how
old
is
it
brother
asked
madame
de
cintré
the
young
man
took
the
two
candles
from
the
lifted
one
high
in
each
hand
and
looked
up
toward
the
cornice
of
the
room
above
the
this
latter
feature
of
the
apartment
was
of
white
marble
and
in
the
familiar
rococo
style
of
the
last
century
but
above
it
was
a
paneling
of
an
earlier
date
quaintly
carved
painted
white
and
gilded
here
and
there
the
white
had
turned
to
yellow
and
the
gilding
was
tarnished
on
the
top
the
figures
ranged
themselves
into
a
sort
of
shield
on
which
an
armorial
device
was
cut
above
it
in
relief
was
a
date
there
you
have
it
said
the
young
man
that
is
old
or
new
according
to
your
point
of
well
over
here
said
newman
one
s
point
of
view
gets
shifted
round
and
he
threw
back
his
head
and
looked
about
the
room
your
house
is
of
a
very
curious
style
of
architecture
he
said
are
you
interested
in
architecture
asked
the
young
man
at
the
well
i
took
the
trouble
this
summer
said
newman
to
examine
as
well
as
i
can
calculate
some
four
hundred
and
seventy
churches
do
you
call
that
interested
perhaps
you
are
interested
in
theology
said
the
young
man
not
particularly
are
you
a
roman
catholic
madam
and
he
turned
to
madame
de
cintré
yes
sir
she
answered
gravely
newman
was
struck
with
the
gravity
of
her
tone
he
threw
back
his
head
and
began
to
look
round
the
room
again
had
you
never
noticed
that
number
up
there
he
presently
asked
she
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
in
former
years
she
said
her
brother
had
been
watching
newman
s
movement
perhaps
you
would
like
to
examine
the
house
he
said
newman
slowly
brought
down
his
eyes
and
looked
at
him
he
had
a
vague
impression
that
the
young
man
at
the
was
inclined
to
irony
he
was
a
handsome
fellow
his
face
wore
a
smile
his
moustaches
were
curled
up
at
the
ends
and
there
was
a
little
dancing
gleam
in
his
eye
damn
his
french
impudence
newman
was
on
the
point
of
saying
to
himself
what
the
deuce
is
he
grinning
at
he
glanced
at
madame
de
cintré
she
was
sitting
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
floor
she
raised
them
they
met
his
and
she
looked
at
her
brother
newman
turned
again
to
this
young
man
and
observed
that
he
strikingly
resembled
his
sister
this
was
in
his
favor
and
our
hero
s
first
impression
of
the
count
valentin
moreover
had
been
agreeable
his
mistrust
expired
and
he
said
he
would
be
very
glad
to
see
the
house
the
young
man
gave
a
frank
laugh
and
laid
his
hand
on
one
of
the
candlesticks
good
good
he
exclaimed
come
but
madame
de
cintré
rose
quickly
and
grasped
his
arm
ah
valentin
she
said
what
do
you
mean
to
do
to
show
newman
the
house
it
will
be
very
she
kept
her
hand
on
his
arm
and
turned
to
newman
with
a
smile
don
t
let
him
take
you
she
said
you
will
not
find
it
amusing
it
is
a
musty
old
house
like
any
it
is
full
of
curious
things
said
the
count
resisting
besides
i
want
to
do
it
it
is
a
rare
you
are
very
wicked
brother
madame
de
cintré
answered
nothing
venture
nothing
have
cried
the
young
man
will
you
come
madame
de
cintré
stepped
toward
newman
gently
clasping
her
hands
and
smiling
softly
would
you
not
prefer
my
society
here
by
my
fire
to
stumbling
about
dark
passages
after
my
brother
a
hundred
times
said
newman
we
will
see
the
house
some
other
the
young
man
put
down
his
candlestick
with
mock
solemnity
and
shaking
his
head
ah
you
have
defeated
a
great
scheme
sir
he
said
a
scheme
i
don
t
understand
said
newman
you
would
have
played
your
part
in
it
all
the
better
perhaps
some
day
i
shall
have
a
chance
to
explain
be
quiet
and
ring
for
the
tea
said
madame
de
cintré
the
young
man
obeyed
and
presently
a
servant
brought
in
the
tea
placed
the
tray
on
a
small
table
and
departed
madame
de
cintré
from
her
place
busied
herself
with
making
it
she
had
but
just
begun
when
the
door
was
thrown
open
and
a
lady
rushed
in
making
a
loud
rustling
sound
she
stared
at
newman
gave
a
little
nod
and
a
monsieur
and
then
quickly
approached
madame
de
cintré
and
presented
her
forehead
to
be
kissed
madame
de
cintré
saluted
her
and
continued
to
make
tea
the
was
young
and
pretty
it
seemed
to
newman
she
wore
her
bonnet
and
cloak
and
a
train
of
royal
proportions
she
began
to
talk
rapidly
in
french
oh
give
me
some
tea
my
beautiful
one
for
the
love
of
god
i
m
exhausted
mangled
newman
found
himself
quite
unable
to
follow
her
she
spoke
much
less
distinctly
than
nioche
that
is
my
said
the
count
valentin
leaning
towards
him
she
is
very
pretty
said
newman
exquisite
answered
the
young
man
and
this
time
again
newman
suspected
him
of
irony
his
came
round
to
the
other
side
of
the
fire
with
her
cup
of
tea
in
her
hand
holding
it
out
at
arm
so
that
she
might
not
spill
it
on
her
dress
and
uttering
little
cries
of
alarm
she
placed
the
cup
on
the
and
begun
to
unpin
her
veil
and
pull
off
her
gloves
looking
meanwhile
at
newman
is
there
anything
i
can
do
for
you
my
dear
lady
the
count
valentin
asked
in
a
sort
of
tone
present
monsieur
said
his
the
young
man
answered
mr
newman
i
can
t
courtesy
to
you
monsieur
or
i
shall
spill
my
tea
said
the
lady
so
claire
receives
strangers
like
that
she
added
in
a
low
voice
in
french
to
her
apparently
he
answered
with
a
smile
newman
stood
a
moment
and
then
he
approached
madame
de
cintré
she
looked
up
at
him
as
if
she
were
thinking
of
something
to
say
but
she
seemed
to
think
of
nothing
so
she
simply
smiled
he
sat
down
near
her
and
she
handed
him
a
cup
of
tea
for
a
few
moments
they
talked
about
that
and
meanwhile
he
looked
at
her
he
remembered
what
tristram
had
told
him
of
her
perfection
and
of
her
having
in
combination
all
the
brilliant
things
that
he
dreamed
of
finding
this
made
him
observe
her
not
only
without
mistrust
but
without
uneasy
conjectures
the
presumption
from
the
first
moment
he
looked
at
her
had
been
in
her
favor
and
yet
if
she
was
beautiful
it
was
not
a
dazzling
beauty
she
was
tall
and
moulded
in
long
lines
she
had
thick
fair
hair
a
wide
forehead
and
features
with
a
sort
of
harmonious
irregularity
her
clear
gray
eyes
were
strikingly
expressive
they
were
both
gentle
and
intelligent
and
newman
liked
them
immensely
but
they
had
not
those
depths
of
splendor
those
rays
which
illumine
the
brows
of
famous
beauties
madame
de
cintré
was
rather
thin
and
she
looked
younger
than
probably
she
was
in
her
whole
person
there
was
something
both
youthful
and
subdued
slender
and
yet
ample
tranquil
yet
shy
a
mixture
of
immaturity
and
repose
of
innocence
and
dignity
what
had
tristram
meant
newman
wondered
by
calling
her
proud
she
was
certainly
not
proud
now
to
him
or
if
she
was
it
was
of
no
use
it
was
lost
upon
him
she
must
pile
it
up
higher
if
she
expected
him
to
mind
it
she
was
a
beautiful
woman
and
it
was
very
easy
to
get
on
with
her
was
she
a
countess
a
a
kind
of
historical
formation
newman
who
had
rarely
heard
these
words
used
had
never
been
at
pains
to
attach
any
particular
image
to
them
but
they
occurred
to
him
now
and
seemed
charged
with
a
sort
of
melodious
meaning
they
signified
something
fair
and
softly
bright
that
had
easy
motions
and
spoke
very
agreeably
have
you
many
friends
in
paris
do
you
go
out
asked
madame
de
cintré
who
had
at
last
thought
of
something
to
say
do
you
mean
do
i
dance
and
all
that
do
you
go
le
as
we
say
i
have
seen
a
good
many
people
tristram
has
taken
me
about
i
do
whatever
she
tells
by
yourself
you
are
not
fond
of
amusements
oh
yes
of
some
sorts
i
am
not
fond
of
dancing
and
that
sort
of
thing
i
am
too
old
and
sober
but
i
want
to
be
amused
i
came
to
europe
for
but
you
can
be
amused
in
america
i
couldn
t
i
was
always
at
work
but
after
all
that
was
my
at
this
moment
madame
de
bellegarde
came
back
for
another
cup
of
tea
accompanied
by
the
count
valentin
madame
de
cintré
when
she
had
served
her
began
to
talk
again
with
newman
and
recalling
what
he
had
last
said
in
your
own
country
you
were
very
much
occupied
she
asked
i
was
in
business
i
have
been
in
business
since
i
was
fifteen
years
and
what
was
your
business
asked
madame
de
bellegarde
who
was
decidedly
not
so
pretty
as
madame
de
cintré
i
have
been
in
everything
said
newman
at
one
time
i
sold
leather
at
one
time
i
manufactured
madame
de
bellegarde
made
a
little
grimace
leather
i
don
t
like
that
are
better
i
prefer
the
smell
of
soap
i
hope
at
least
they
made
your
she
rattled
this
off
with
the
air
of
a
woman
who
had
the
reputation
of
saying
everything
that
came
into
her
head
and
with
a
strong
french
accent
newman
had
spoken
with
cheerful
seriousness
but
madame
de
bellegarde
s
tone
made
him
go
on
after
a
meditative
pause
with
a
certain
light
grimness
of
jocularity
no
i
lost
money
on
but
i
came
out
pretty
square
on
i
have
made
up
my
mind
after
all
said
madame
de
bellegarde
that
the
great
point
is
how
do
you
call
it
to
come
out
square
i
am
on
my
knees
to
money
i
don
t
deny
it
if
you
have
it
i
ask
no
questions
for
that
i
am
a
real
democrat
like
you
monsieur
madame
de
cintré
is
very
proud
but
i
find
that
one
gets
much
more
pleasure
in
this
sad
life
if
one
doesn
t
look
too
just
heaven
dear
madam
how
you
go
at
it
said
the
count
valentin
lowering
his
voice
he
s
a
man
one
can
speak
to
i
suppose
since
my
sister
receives
him
the
lady
answered
besides
it
s
very
true
those
are
my
ah
you
call
them
ideas
murmured
the
young
man
but
tristram
told
me
you
had
been
in
the
army
in
your
war
said
madame
de
cintré
yes
but
that
is
not
business
said
newman
very
true
said
de
bellegarde
otherwise
perhaps
i
should
not
be
is
it
true
asked
newman
in
a
moment
that
you
are
so
proud
i
had
already
heard
madame
de
cintré
smiled
do
you
find
me
so
oh
said
newman
i
am
no
judge
if
you
are
proud
with
me
you
will
have
to
tell
me
otherwise
i
shall
not
know
madame
de
cintré
began
to
laugh
that
would
be
pride
in
a
sad
position
she
said
it
would
be
partly
newman
went
on
because
i
shouldn
t
want
to
know
it
i
want
you
to
treat
me
madame
de
cintré
whose
laugh
had
ceased
looked
at
him
with
her
head
half
averted
as
if
she
feared
what
he
was
going
to
say
mrs
tristram
told
you
the
literal
truth
he
went
on
i
want
very
much
to
know
you
i
didn
t
come
here
simply
to
call
i
came
in
the
hope
that
you
might
ask
me
to
come
oh
pray
come
often
said
madame
de
cintré
but
will
you
be
at
home
newman
insisted
even
to
himself
he
seemed
a
trifle
pushing
but
he
was
in
truth
a
trifle
excited
i
hope
so
said
madame
de
cintré
newman
got
up
well
we
shall
see
he
said
smoothing
his
hat
with
his
brother
said
madame
de
cintré
invite
newman
to
come
the
count
valentin
looked
at
our
hero
from
head
to
foot
with
his
peculiar
smile
in
which
impudence
and
urbanity
seemed
perplexingly
commingled
are
you
a
brave
man
he
asked
eying
him
askance
well
i
hope
so
said
newman
i
rather
suspect
so
in
that
case
come
ah
what
an
invitation
murmured
madame
de
cintré
with
something
painful
in
her
smile
oh
i
want
newman
to
come
particularly
said
the
young
man
it
will
give
me
great
pleasure
i
shall
be
desolate
if
i
miss
one
of
his
visits
but
i
maintain
he
must
be
brave
a
stout
heart
sir
and
he
offered
newman
his
hand
i
shall
not
come
to
see
you
i
shall
come
to
see
madame
de
cintré
said
newman
you
will
need
all
the
more
ah
valentin
said
madame
de
cintré
appealingly
decidedly
cried
madame
de
bellegarde
i
am
the
only
person
here
capable
of
saying
something
polite
come
to
see
me
you
will
need
no
courage
she
said
newman
gave
a
laugh
which
was
not
altogether
an
assent
and
took
his
leave
madame
de
cintré
did
not
take
up
her
sister
s
challenge
to
be
gracious
but
she
looked
with
a
certain
troubled
air
at
the
retreating
guest
chapter
vii
one
evening
very
late
about
a
week
after
his
visit
to
madame
de
cintré
newman
s
servant
brought
him
a
card
it
was
that
of
young
de
bellegarde
when
a
few
moments
later
he
went
to
receive
his
visitor
he
found
him
standing
in
the
middle
of
his
great
gilded
parlor
and
eying
it
from
cornice
to
carpet
de
bellegarde
s
face
it
seemed
to
newman
expressed
a
sense
of
lively
entertainment
what
the
devil
is
he
laughing
at
now
our
hero
asked
himself
but
he
put
the
question
without
acrimony
for
he
felt
that
madame
de
cintré
s
brother
was
a
good
fellow
and
he
had
a
presentiment
that
on
this
basis
of
good
fellowship
they
were
destined
to
understand
each
other
only
if
there
was
anything
to
laugh
at
he
wished
to
have
a
glimpse
of
it
too
to
begin
with
said
the
young
man
as
he
extended
his
hand
have
i
come
too
late
too
late
for
what
asked
newman
to
smoke
a
cigar
with
you
would
have
to
come
early
to
do
that
said
newman
i
don
t
ah
you
are
a
strong
man
but
i
keep
cigars
newman
added
sit
surely
i
may
not
smoke
here
said
de
bellegarde
what
is
the
matter
is
the
room
too
small
it
is
too
large
it
is
like
smoking
in
a
or
a
that
is
what
you
were
laughing
at
just
now
newman
asked
the
size
of
my
room
it
is
not
size
only
replied
de
bellegarde
but
splendor
and
harmony
and
beauty
of
detail
it
was
the
smile
of
newman
looked
at
him
a
moment
and
then
so
it
very
ugly
he
inquired
ugly
my
dear
sir
it
is
that
is
the
same
thing
i
suppose
said
newman
make
yourself
comfortable
your
coming
to
see
me
i
take
it
is
an
act
of
friendship
you
were
not
obliged
to
therefore
if
anything
around
here
amuses
you
it
will
be
all
in
a
pleasant
way
laugh
as
loud
as
you
please
i
like
to
see
my
visitors
cheerful
only
i
must
make
this
request
that
you
explain
the
joke
to
me
as
soon
as
you
can
speak
i
don
t
want
to
lose
anything
de
bellegarde
stared
with
a
look
of
unresentful
perplexity
he
laid
his
hand
on
newman
s
sleeve
and
seemed
on
the
point
of
saying
something
but
he
suddenly
checked
himself
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
puffed
at
his
cigar
at
last
however
breaking
silence
certainly
he
said
my
coming
to
see
you
is
an
act
of
friendship
nevertheless
i
was
in
a
measure
obliged
to
do
so
my
sister
asked
me
to
come
and
a
request
from
my
sister
is
for
me
a
law
i
was
near
you
and
i
observed
lights
in
what
i
supposed
were
your
rooms
it
was
not
a
ceremonious
hour
for
making
a
call
but
i
was
not
sorry
to
do
something
that
would
show
i
was
not
performing
a
mere
well
here
i
am
as
large
as
life
said
newman
extending
his
legs
i
don
t
know
what
you
mean
the
young
man
went
on
by
giving
me
unlimited
leave
to
laugh
certainly
i
am
a
great
laugher
and
it
is
better
to
laugh
too
much
than
too
little
but
it
is
not
in
order
that
we
may
laugh
together
or
separately
that
i
have
i
may
say
sought
your
acquaintance
to
speak
with
almost
impudent
frankness
you
interest
me
all
this
was
uttered
by
de
bellegarde
with
the
modulated
smoothness
of
the
man
of
the
world
and
in
spite
of
his
excellent
english
of
the
frenchman
but
newman
at
the
same
time
that
he
sat
noting
its
harmonious
flow
perceived
that
it
was
not
mere
mechanical
urbanity
decidedly
there
was
something
in
his
visitor
that
he
liked
de
bellegarde
was
a
foreigner
to
his
and
if
newman
had
met
him
on
a
western
prairie
he
would
have
felt
it
proper
to
address
him
with
a
mosseer
but
there
was
something
in
his
physiognomy
which
seemed
to
cast
a
sort
of
aerial
bridge
over
the
impassable
gulf
produced
by
difference
of
race
he
was
below
the
middle
height
and
robust
and
agile
in
figure
valentin
de
bellegarde
newman
afterwards
learned
had
a
mortal
dread
of
the
robustness
overtaking
the
agility
he
was
afraid
of
growing
stout
he
was
too
short
as
he
said
to
afford
a
belly
he
rode
and
fenced
and
practiced
gymnastics
with
unremitting
zeal
and
if
you
greeted
him
with
a
how
well
you
are
looking
he
started
and
turned
pale
in
your
he
read
a
grosser
monosyllable
he
had
a
round
head
high
above
the
ears
a
crop
of
hair
at
once
dense
and
silky
a
broad
low
forehead
a
short
nose
of
the
ironical
and
inquiring
rather
than
of
the
dogmatic
or
sensitive
cast
and
a
moustache
as
delicate
as
that
of
a
page
in
a
romance
he
resembled
his
sister
not
in
feature
but
in
the
expression
of
his
clear
bright
eye
completely
void
of
introspection
and
in
the
way
he
smiled
the
great
point
in
his
face
was
that
it
was
intensely
alive
frankly
ardently
gallantly
alive
the
look
of
it
was
like
a
bell
of
which
the
handle
might
have
been
in
the
young
man
s
soul
at
a
touch
of
the
handle
it
rang
with
a
loud
silver
sound
there
was
something
in
his
quick
light
brown
eye
which
assured
you
that
he
was
not
economizing
his
consciousness
he
was
not
living
in
a
corner
of
it
to
spare
the
furniture
of
the
rest
he
was
squarely
encamped
in
the
centre
and
he
was
keeping
open
house
when
he
smiled
it
was
like
the
movement
of
a
person
who
in
emptying
a
cup
turns
it
upside
down
he
gave
you
the
last
drop
of
his
jollity
he
inspired
newman
with
something
of
the
same
kindness
that
our
hero
used
to
feel
in
his
earlier
years
for
those
of
his
companions
who
could
perform
strange
and
clever
tricks
make
their
joints
crack
in
queer
places
or
whistle
at
the
back
of
their
mouths
my
sister
told
me
de
bellegarde
continued
that
i
ought
to
come
and
remove
the
impression
that
i
had
taken
such
great
pains
to
produce
upon
you
the
impression
that
i
am
a
lunatic
did
it
strike
you
that
i
behaved
very
oddly
the
other
day
rather
so
said
newman
so
my
sister
tells
and
de
bellegarde
watched
his
host
for
a
moment
through
his
if
that
is
the
case
i
think
we
had
better
let
it
stand
i
didn
t
try
to
make
you
think
i
was
a
lunatic
at
all
on
the
contrary
i
wanted
to
produce
a
favorable
impression
but
if
after
all
i
made
a
fool
of
myself
it
was
the
intention
of
providence
i
should
injure
myself
by
protesting
too
much
for
i
should
seem
to
set
up
a
claim
for
wisdom
which
in
the
sequel
of
our
acquaintance
i
could
by
no
means
justify
set
me
down
as
a
lunatic
with
intervals
of
oh
i
guess
you
know
what
you
are
about
said
newman
when
i
am
sane
i
am
very
sane
that
i
admit
de
bellegarde
answered
but
i
didn
t
come
here
to
talk
about
myself
i
should
like
to
ask
you
a
few
questions
you
allow
me
give
me
a
specimen
said
newman
you
live
here
all
alone
absolutely
with
whom
should
i
live
for
the
moment
said
de
bellegarde
with
a
smile
i
am
asking
questions
not
answering
them
you
have
come
to
paris
for
your
pleasure
newman
was
silent
a
while
then
at
last
everyone
asks
me
that
he
said
with
his
mild
slowness
it
sounds
so
awfully
but
at
any
rate
you
had
a
oh
i
came
for
my
pleasure
said
newman
though
it
is
foolish
it
is
and
you
are
enjoying
it
like
any
other
good
american
newman
thought
it
as
well
not
to
truckle
to
the
foreigner
oh
he
answered
de
bellegarde
puffed
his
cigar
again
in
silence
for
myself
he
said
at
last
i
am
entirely
at
your
service
anything
i
can
do
for
you
i
shall
be
very
happy
to
do
call
upon
me
at
your
convenience
is
there
anyone
you
desire
to
know
anything
you
wish
to
see
it
is
a
pity
you
should
not
enjoy
oh
i
do
enjoy
it
said
newman
i
m
much
obliged
to
honestly
speaking
de
bellegarde
went
on
there
is
something
absurd
to
me
in
hearing
myself
make
you
these
offers
they
represent
a
great
deal
of
goodwill
but
they
represent
little
else
you
are
a
successful
man
and
i
am
a
failure
and
it
s
a
turning
of
the
tables
to
talk
as
if
i
could
lend
you
a
in
what
way
are
you
a
failure
asked
newman
oh
i
m
not
a
tragical
failure
cried
the
young
man
with
a
laugh
i
have
fallen
from
a
height
and
my
fiasco
has
made
no
noise
you
evidently
are
a
success
you
have
made
a
fortune
you
have
built
up
an
edifice
you
are
a
financial
commercial
power
you
can
travel
about
the
world
until
you
have
found
a
soft
spot
and
lie
down
in
it
with
the
consciousness
of
having
earned
your
rest
is
not
that
true
well
imagine
the
exact
reverse
of
all
that
and
you
have
me
i
have
done
nothing
i
can
do
nothing
why
not
it
s
a
long
story
some
day
i
will
tell
you
meanwhile
i
m
right
eh
you
are
a
success
you
have
made
a
fortune
it
s
none
of
my
business
but
in
short
you
are
rich
that
s
another
thing
that
it
sounds
foolish
to
say
said
newman
hang
it
no
man
is
rich
i
have
heard
philosophers
affirm
laughed
de
bellegarde
that
no
man
was
poor
but
your
formula
strikes
me
as
an
improvement
as
a
general
thing
i
confess
i
don
t
like
successful
people
and
i
find
clever
men
who
have
made
great
fortunes
very
offensive
they
tread
on
my
toes
they
make
me
uncomfortable
but
as
soon
as
i
saw
you
i
said
to
myself
ah
there
is
a
man
with
whom
i
shall
get
on
he
has
the
of
success
and
none
of
the
he
has
not
our
confoundedly
irritable
french
in
short
i
took
a
fancy
to
you
we
are
very
different
i
m
sure
i
don
t
believe
there
is
a
subject
on
which
we
think
or
feel
alike
but
i
rather
think
we
shall
get
on
for
there
is
such
a
thing
you
know
as
being
too
different
to
oh
i
never
quarrel
said
newman
never
sometimes
it
s
a
duty
or
at
least
it
s
a
pleasure
oh
i
have
had
two
or
three
delicious
quarrels
in
my
day
and
de
bellegarde
s
handsome
smile
assumed
at
the
memory
of
these
incidents
an
almost
voluptuous
intensity
with
the
preamble
embodied
in
his
share
of
the
foregoing
fragment
of
dialogue
he
paid
our
hero
a
long
visit
as
the
two
men
sat
with
their
heels
on
newman
s
glowing
hearth
they
heard
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
striking
larger
from
a
belfry
valentin
de
bellegarde
was
by
his
own
confession
at
all
times
a
great
chatterer
and
on
this
occasion
he
was
evidently
in
a
particularly
loquacious
mood
it
was
a
tradition
of
his
race
that
people
of
its
blood
always
conferred
a
favor
by
their
smiles
and
as
his
enthusiasms
were
as
rare
as
his
civility
was
constant
he
had
a
double
reason
for
not
suspecting
that
his
friendship
could
ever
be
importunate
moreover
the
flower
of
an
ancient
stem
as
he
was
tradition
since
i
have
used
the
word
had
in
his
temperament
nothing
of
disagreeable
rigidity
it
was
muffled
in
sociability
and
urbanity
as
an
old
dowager
in
her
laces
and
strings
of
pearls
valentin
was
what
is
called
in
france
a
of
the
purest
source
and
his
rule
of
life
so
far
as
it
was
definite
was
to
play
the
part
of
a
this
it
seemed
to
him
was
enough
to
occupy
comfortably
a
young
man
of
ordinary
good
parts
but
all
that
he
was
he
was
by
instinct
and
not
by
theory
and
the
amiability
of
his
character
was
so
great
that
certain
of
the
aristocratic
virtues
which
in
some
aspects
seem
rather
brittle
and
trenchant
acquired
in
his
application
of
them
an
extreme
geniality
in
his
younger
years
he
had
been
suspected
of
low
tastes
and
his
mother
had
greatly
feared
he
would
make
a
slip
in
the
mud
of
the
highway
and
bespatter
the
family
shield
he
had
been
treated
therefore
to
more
than
his
share
of
schooling
and
drilling
but
his
instructors
had
not
succeeded
in
mounting
him
upon
stilts
they
could
not
spoil
his
safe
spontaneity
and
he
remained
the
least
cautious
and
the
most
lucky
of
young
nobles
he
had
been
tied
with
so
short
a
rope
in
his
youth
that
he
had
now
a
mortal
grudge
against
family
discipline
he
had
been
known
to
say
within
the
limits
of
the
family
that
as
he
was
the
honor
of
the
name
was
safer
in
his
hands
than
in
those
of
some
of
its
other
members
and
that
if
a
day
ever
came
to
try
it
they
should
see
his
talk
was
an
odd
mixture
of
almost
boyish
garrulity
and
of
the
reserve
and
discretion
of
the
man
of
the
world
and
he
seemed
to
newman
as
afterwards
young
members
of
the
latin
races
often
seemed
to
him
now
amusingly
juvenile
and
now
appallingly
mature
in
america
newman
reflected
lads
of
and
thirty
have
old
heads
and
young
hearts
or
at
least
young
morals
here
they
have
young
heads
and
very
aged
hearts
morals
the
most
grizzled
and
wrinkled
what
i
envy
you
is
your
liberty
observed
de
bellegarde
your
wide
range
your
freedom
to
come
and
go
your
not
having
a
lot
of
people
who
take
themselves
awfully
seriously
expecting
something
of
you
i
live
he
added
with
a
sigh
beneath
the
eyes
of
my
admirable
it
is
your
own
fault
what
is
to
hinder
your
ranging
said
newman
there
is
a
delightful
simplicity
in
that
remark
everything
is
to
hinder
me
to
begin
with
i
have
not
a
i
had
not
a
penny
when
i
began
to
ah
but
your
poverty
was
your
capital
being
an
american
it
was
impossible
you
should
remain
what
you
were
born
and
being
born
poor
do
i
understand
it
it
was
therefore
inevitable
that
you
should
become
rich
you
were
in
a
position
that
makes
one
s
mouth
water
you
looked
round
you
and
saw
a
world
full
of
things
you
had
only
to
step
up
to
and
take
hold
of
when
i
was
twenty
i
looked
around
me
and
saw
a
world
with
everything
ticketed
hands
off
and
the
deuce
of
it
was
that
the
ticket
seemed
meant
only
for
me
i
couldn
t
go
into
business
i
couldn
t
make
money
because
i
was
a
bellegarde
i
couldn
t
go
into
politics
because
i
was
a
bellegarde
the
bellegardes
don
t
recognize
the
bonapartes
i
couldn
t
go
into
literature
because
i
was
a
dunce
i
couldn
t
marry
a
rich
girl
because
no
bellegarde
had
ever
married
a
and
it
was
not
proper
that
i
should
begin
we
shall
have
to
come
to
it
yet
marriageable
heiresses
notre
are
not
to
be
had
for
nothing
it
must
be
name
for
name
and
fortune
for
fortune
the
only
thing
i
could
do
was
to
go
and
fight
for
the
pope
that
i
did
punctiliously
and
received
an
apostolic
at
castlefidardo
it
did
neither
the
holy
father
nor
me
any
good
that
i
could
see
rome
was
doubtless
a
very
amusing
place
in
the
days
of
caligula
but
it
has
sadly
fallen
off
since
i
passed
three
years
in
the
castle
of
angelo
and
then
came
back
to
secular
so
you
have
no
profession
you
do
nothing
said
newman
i
do
nothing
i
am
supposed
to
amuse
myself
and
to
tell
the
truth
i
have
amused
myself
one
can
if
one
knows
how
but
you
can
t
keep
it
up
forever
i
am
good
for
another
five
years
perhaps
but
i
foresee
that
after
that
i
shall
lose
my
appetite
then
what
shall
i
do
i
think
i
shall
turn
monk
seriously
i
think
i
shall
tie
a
rope
round
my
waist
and
go
into
a
monastery
it
was
an
old
custom
and
the
old
customs
were
very
good
people
understood
life
quite
as
well
as
we
do
they
kept
the
pot
boiling
till
it
cracked
and
then
they
put
it
on
the
shelf
are
you
very
religious
asked
newman
in
a
tone
which
gave
the
inquiry
a
grotesque
effect
de
bellegarde
evidently
appreciated
the
comical
element
in
the
question
but
he
looked
at
newman
a
moment
with
extreme
soberness
i
am
a
very
good
catholic
i
respect
the
church
i
adore
the
blessed
virgin
i
fear
the
well
then
said
newman
you
are
very
well
fixed
you
have
got
pleasure
in
the
present
and
religion
in
the
future
what
do
you
complain
of
it
s
a
part
of
one
s
pleasure
to
complain
there
is
something
in
your
own
circumstances
that
irritates
me
you
are
the
first
man
i
have
ever
envied
it
s
singular
but
so
it
is
i
have
known
many
men
who
besides
any
factitious
advantages
that
i
may
possess
had
money
and
brains
into
the
bargain
but
somehow
they
have
never
disturbed
my
but
you
have
got
something
that
i
should
have
liked
to
have
it
is
not
money
it
is
not
even
brains
though
no
doubt
yours
are
excellent
it
is
not
your
six
feet
of
height
though
i
should
have
rather
liked
to
be
a
couple
of
inches
taller
it
s
a
sort
of
air
you
have
of
being
thoroughly
at
home
in
the
world
when
i
was
a
boy
my
father
told
me
that
it
was
by
such
an
air
as
that
that
people
recognized
a
bellegarde
he
called
my
attention
to
it
he
didn
t
advise
me
to
cultivate
it
he
said
that
as
we
grew
up
it
always
came
of
itself
i
supposed
it
had
come
to
me
because
i
think
i
have
always
had
the
feeling
my
place
in
life
was
made
for
me
and
it
seemed
easy
to
occupy
it
but
you
who
as
i
understand
it
have
made
your
own
place
you
who
as
you
told
us
the
other
day
have
manufactured
you
strike
me
somehow
as
a
man
who
stands
at
his
ease
who
looks
at
things
from
a
height
i
fancy
you
going
about
the
world
like
a
man
traveling
on
a
railroad
in
which
he
owns
a
large
amount
of
stock
you
make
me
feel
as
if
i
had
missed
something
what
is
it
it
is
the
proud
consciousness
of
honest
toil
of
having
manufactured
a
few
said
newman
at
once
jocose
and
serious
oh
no
i
have
seen
men
who
had
done
even
more
men
who
had
made
not
only
but
soap
yellow
soap
in
great
bars
and
they
never
made
me
the
least
then
it
s
the
privilege
of
being
an
american
citizen
said
newman
that
sets
a
man
possibly
rejoined
de
bellegarde
but
i
am
forced
to
say
that
i
have
seen
a
great
many
american
citizens
who
didn
t
seem
at
all
set
up
or
in
the
least
like
large
i
never
envied
them
i
rather
think
the
thing
is
an
accomplishment
of
your
oh
come
said
newman
you
will
make
me
proud
no
i
shall
not
you
have
nothing
to
do
with
pride
or
with
humility
that
is
a
part
of
this
easy
manner
of
yours
people
are
proud
only
when
they
have
something
to
lose
and
humble
when
they
have
something
to
i
don
t
know
what
i
have
to
lose
said
newman
but
i
certainly
have
something
to
what
is
it
asked
his
visitor
newman
hesitated
a
while
i
will
tell
you
when
i
know
you
i
hope
that
will
be
soon
then
if
i
can
help
you
to
gain
it
i
shall
be
perhaps
you
may
said
newman
don
t
forget
then
that
i
am
your
servant
de
bellegarde
answered
and
shortly
afterwards
he
took
his
departure
during
the
next
three
weeks
newman
saw
bellegarde
several
times
and
without
formally
swearing
an
eternal
friendship
the
two
men
established
a
sort
of
comradeship
to
newman
bellegarde
was
the
ideal
frenchman
the
frenchman
of
tradition
and
romance
so
far
as
our
hero
was
concerned
with
these
mystical
influences
gallant
expansive
amusing
more
pleased
himself
with
the
effect
he
produced
than
those
even
when
they
were
well
pleased
for
whom
he
produced
it
a
master
of
all
the
distinctively
social
virtues
and
a
votary
of
all
agreeable
sensations
a
devotee
of
something
mysterious
and
sacred
to
which
he
occasionally
alluded
in
terms
more
ecstatic
even
than
those
in
which
he
spoke
of
the
last
pretty
woman
and
which
was
simply
the
beautiful
though
somewhat
superannuated
image
of
he
was
irresistibly
entertaining
and
enlivening
and
he
formed
a
character
to
which
newman
was
as
capable
of
doing
justice
when
he
had
once
been
placed
in
contact
with
it
as
he
was
unlikely
in
musing
upon
the
possible
mixtures
of
our
human
ingredients
mentally
to
have
foreshadowed
it
bellegarde
did
not
in
the
least
cause
him
to
modify
his
needful
premise
that
all
frenchmen
are
of
a
frothy
and
imponderable
substance
he
simply
reminded
him
that
light
materials
may
be
beaten
up
into
a
most
agreeable
compound
no
two
companions
could
be
more
different
but
their
differences
made
a
capital
basis
for
a
friendship
of
which
the
distinctive
characteristic
was
that
it
was
extremely
amusing
to
each
valentin
de
bellegarde
lived
in
the
basement
of
an
old
house
in
the
rue
d
anjou
honoré
and
his
small
apartments
lay
between
the
court
of
the
house
and
an
old
garden
which
spread
itself
behind
it
one
of
those
large
sunless
humid
gardens
into
which
you
look
unexpectingly
in
paris
from
back
windows
wondering
how
among
the
grudging
habitations
they
find
their
space
when
newman
returned
bellegarde
s
visit
he
hinted
that
lodging
was
at
least
as
much
a
laughing
matter
as
his
own
but
its
oddities
were
of
a
different
cast
from
those
of
our
hero
s
gilded
saloons
on
the
boulevard
haussmann
the
place
was
low
dusky
contracted
and
crowded
with
curious
bellegarde
penniless
patrician
as
he
was
was
an
insatiable
collector
and
his
walls
were
covered
with
rusty
arms
and
ancient
panels
and
platters
his
doorways
draped
in
faded
tapestries
his
floors
muffled
in
the
skins
of
beasts
here
and
there
was
one
of
those
uncomfortable
tributes
to
elegance
in
which
the
upholsterer
s
art
in
france
is
so
prolific
a
curtain
recess
with
a
sheet
of
in
which
among
the
shadows
you
could
see
nothing
a
divan
on
which
for
its
festoons
and
furbelows
you
could
not
sit
a
fireplace
draped
flounced
and
frilled
to
the
complete
exclusion
of
fire
the
young
man
s
possessions
were
in
picturesque
disorder
and
his
apartment
was
pervaded
by
the
odor
of
cigars
mingled
with
perfumes
more
inscrutable
newman
thought
it
a
damp
gloomy
place
to
live
in
and
was
puzzled
by
the
obstructive
and
fragmentary
character
of
the
furniture
bellegarde
according
to
the
custom
of
his
country
talked
very
generously
about
himself
and
unveiled
the
mysteries
of
his
private
history
with
an
unsparing
hand
inevitably
he
had
a
vast
deal
to
say
about
women
and
he
used
frequently
to
indulge
in
sentimental
and
ironical
apostrophes
to
these
authors
of
his
joys
and
woes
oh
the
women
the
women
and
the
things
they
have
made
me
do
he
would
exclaim
with
a
lustrous
eye
est
of
all
the
follies
and
stupidities
i
have
committed
for
them
i
would
not
have
missed
one
on
this
subject
newman
maintained
an
habitual
reserve
to
expatiate
largely
upon
it
had
always
seemed
to
him
a
proceeding
vaguely
analogous
to
the
cooing
of
pigeons
and
the
chattering
of
monkeys
and
even
inconsistent
with
a
fully
developed
human
character
but
bellegarde
s
confidences
greatly
amused
him
and
rarely
displeased
him
for
the
generous
young
frenchman
was
not
a
cynic
i
really
think
he
had
once
said
that
i
am
not
more
depraved
than
most
of
my
contemporaries
they
are
tolerably
depraved
my
contemporaries
he
said
wonderfully
pretty
things
about
his
female
friends
and
numerous
and
various
as
they
had
been
declared
that
on
the
whole
there
was
more
good
in
them
than
harm
but
you
are
not
to
take
that
as
advice
he
added
as
an
authority
i
am
very
untrustworthy
i
m
prejudiced
in
their
favor
i
m
an
newman
listened
to
him
with
his
impartial
smile
and
was
glad
for
his
own
sake
that
he
had
fine
feelings
but
he
mentally
repudiated
the
idea
of
a
frenchman
having
discovered
any
merit
in
the
amiable
sex
which
he
himself
did
not
suspect
de
bellegarde
however
did
not
confine
his
conversation
to
the
autobiographical
channel
he
questioned
our
hero
largely
as
to
the
events
of
his
own
life
and
newman
told
him
some
better
stories
than
any
that
bellegarde
carried
in
his
budget
he
narrated
his
career
in
fact
from
the
beginning
through
all
its
variations
and
whenever
his
companion
s
credulity
or
his
habits
of
gentility
appeared
to
protest
it
amused
him
to
heighten
the
color
of
the
episode
newman
had
sat
with
western
humorists
in
knots
round
stoves
and
seen
tall
stories
grow
taller
without
toppling
over
and
his
own
imagination
had
learned
the
trick
of
piling
up
consistent
wonders
bellegarde
s
regular
attitude
at
last
became
that
of
laughing
to
maintain
his
reputation
as
an
frenchman
he
doubted
of
everything
wholesale
the
result
of
this
was
that
newman
found
it
impossible
to
convince
him
of
certain
verities
but
the
details
don
t
matter
said
de
bellegarde
you
have
evidently
had
some
surprising
adventures
you
have
seen
some
strange
sides
of
life
you
have
revolved
to
and
fro
over
a
whole
continent
as
i
walked
up
and
down
the
boulevard
you
are
a
man
of
the
world
with
a
vengeance
you
have
spent
some
deadly
dull
hours
and
you
have
done
some
extremely
disagreeable
things
you
have
shoveled
sand
as
a
boy
for
supper
and
you
have
eaten
roast
dog
in
a
camp
you
have
stood
casting
up
figures
for
ten
hours
at
a
time
and
you
have
sat
through
methodist
sermons
for
the
sake
of
looking
at
a
pretty
girl
in
another
pew
all
that
is
rather
stiff
as
we
say
but
at
any
rate
you
have
done
something
and
you
are
something
you
have
used
your
will
and
you
have
made
your
fortune
you
have
not
stupified
yourself
with
debauchery
and
you
have
not
mortgaged
your
fortune
to
social
conveniences
you
take
things
easily
and
you
have
fewer
prejudices
even
than
i
who
pretend
to
have
none
but
who
in
reality
have
three
or
four
happy
man
you
are
strong
and
you
are
free
but
what
the
deuce
demanded
the
young
man
in
conclusion
do
you
propose
to
do
with
such
advantages
really
to
use
them
you
need
a
better
world
than
this
there
is
nothing
worth
your
while
oh
i
think
there
is
something
said
newman
what
is
it
well
murmured
newman
i
will
tell
you
some
other
time
in
this
way
our
hero
delayed
from
day
to
day
broaching
a
subject
which
he
had
very
much
at
heart
meanwhile
however
he
was
growing
practically
familiar
with
it
in
other
words
he
had
called
again
three
times
on
madame
de
cintré
on
only
two
of
these
occasions
had
he
found
her
at
home
and
on
each
of
them
she
had
other
visitors
her
visitors
were
numerous
and
extremely
loquacious
and
they
exacted
much
of
their
hostess
s
attention
she
found
time
however
to
bestow
a
little
of
it
on
newman
in
an
occasional
vague
smile
the
very
vagueness
of
which
pleased
him
allowing
him
as
it
did
to
fill
it
out
mentally
both
at
the
time
and
afterwards
with
such
meanings
as
most
pleased
him
he
sat
by
without
speaking
looking
at
the
entrances
and
exits
the
greetings
and
chatterings
of
madame
de
cintré
s
visitors
he
felt
as
if
he
were
at
the
play
and
as
if
his
own
speaking
would
be
an
interruption
sometimes
he
wished
he
had
a
book
to
follow
the
dialogue
he
half
expected
to
see
a
woman
in
a
white
cap
and
pink
ribbons
come
and
offer
him
one
for
two
francs
some
of
the
ladies
looked
at
him
very
hard
or
very
soft
as
you
please
others
seemed
profoundly
unconscious
of
his
presence
the
men
looked
only
at
madame
de
cintré
this
was
inevitable
for
whether
one
called
her
beautiful
or
not
she
entirely
occupied
and
filled
one
s
vision
just
as
an
agreeable
sound
fills
one
s
ear
newman
had
but
twenty
distinct
words
with
her
but
he
carried
away
an
impression
to
which
solemn
promises
could
not
have
given
a
higher
value
she
was
part
of
the
play
that
he
was
seeing
acted
quite
as
much
as
her
companions
but
how
she
filled
the
stage
and
how
much
better
she
did
it
whether
she
rose
or
seated
herself
whether
she
went
with
her
departing
friends
to
the
door
and
lifted
up
the
heavy
curtain
as
they
passed
out
and
stood
an
instant
looking
after
them
and
giving
them
the
last
nod
or
whether
she
leaned
back
in
her
chair
with
her
arms
crossed
and
her
eyes
resting
listening
and
smiling
she
gave
newman
the
feeling
that
he
should
like
to
have
her
always
before
him
moving
slowly
to
and
fro
along
the
whole
scale
of
expressive
hospitality
if
it
might
be
him
it
would
be
well
if
it
might
be
him
it
would
be
still
better
she
was
so
tall
and
yet
so
light
so
active
and
yet
so
still
so
elegant
and
yet
so
simple
so
frank
and
yet
so
mysterious
it
was
the
mystery
it
was
what
she
was
off
the
stage
as
it
were
that
interested
newman
most
of
all
he
could
not
have
told
you
what
warrant
he
had
for
talking
about
mysteries
if
it
had
been
his
habit
to
express
himself
in
poetic
figures
he
might
have
said
that
in
observing
madame
de
cintré
he
seemed
to
see
the
vague
circle
which
sometimes
accompanies
the
disk
of
the
moon
it
was
not
that
she
was
reserved
on
the
contrary
she
was
as
frank
as
flowing
water
but
he
was
sure
she
had
qualities
which
she
herself
did
not
suspect
he
had
abstained
for
several
reasons
from
saying
some
of
these
things
to
bellegarde
one
reason
was
that
before
proceeding
to
any
act
he
was
always
circumspect
conjectural
contemplative
he
had
little
eagerness
as
became
a
man
who
felt
that
whenever
he
really
began
to
move
he
walked
with
long
steps
and
then
it
simply
pleased
him
not
to
speak
it
occupied
him
it
excited
him
but
one
day
bellegarde
had
been
dining
with
him
at
a
restaurant
and
they
had
sat
long
over
their
dinner
on
rising
from
it
bellegarde
proposed
that
to
help
them
through
the
rest
of
the
evening
they
should
go
and
see
madame
dandelard
madame
dandelard
was
a
little
italian
lady
who
had
married
a
frenchman
who
proved
to
be
a
rake
and
a
brute
and
the
torment
of
her
life
her
husband
had
spent
all
her
money
and
then
lacking
the
means
of
obtaining
more
expensive
pleasures
had
taken
in
his
duller
hours
to
beating
her
she
had
a
blue
spot
somewhere
which
she
showed
to
several
persons
including
bellegarde
she
had
obtained
a
separation
from
her
husband
collected
the
scraps
of
her
fortune
they
were
very
meagre
and
come
to
live
in
paris
where
she
was
staying
at
a
she
was
always
looking
for
an
apartment
and
visiting
inquiringly
those
of
other
people
she
was
very
pretty
very
childlike
and
she
made
very
extraordinary
remarks
bellegarde
had
made
her
acquaintance
and
the
source
of
his
interest
in
her
was
according
to
his
own
declaration
a
curiosity
as
to
what
would
become
of
her
she
is
poor
she
is
pretty
and
she
is
silly
he
said
it
seems
to
me
she
can
go
only
one
way
it
s
a
pity
but
it
can
t
be
helped
i
will
give
her
six
months
she
has
nothing
to
fear
from
me
but
i
am
watching
the
process
i
am
curious
to
see
just
how
things
will
go
yes
i
know
what
you
are
going
to
say
this
horrible
paris
hardens
one
s
heart
but
it
quickens
one
s
wits
and
it
ends
by
teaching
one
a
refinement
of
observation
to
see
this
little
woman
s
little
drama
play
itself
out
now
is
for
me
an
intellectual
if
she
is
going
to
throw
herself
away
newman
had
said
you
ought
to
stop
stop
her
how
stop
her
talk
to
her
give
her
some
good
bellegarde
laughed
heaven
deliver
us
both
imagine
the
situation
go
and
advise
her
it
was
after
this
that
newman
had
gone
with
bellegarde
to
see
madame
dandelard
when
they
came
away
bellegarde
reproached
his
companion
where
was
your
famous
advice
he
asked
i
didn
t
hear
a
word
of
oh
i
give
it
up
said
newman
simply
then
you
are
as
bad
as
i
said
bellegarde
no
because
i
don
t
take
an
intellectual
pleasure
in
her
prospective
adventures
i
don
t
in
the
least
want
to
see
her
going
down
hill
i
had
rather
look
the
other
way
but
why
he
asked
in
a
moment
don
t
you
get
your
sister
to
go
and
see
her
bellegarde
stared
go
and
see
madame
dandelard
my
sister
she
might
talk
to
her
to
very
good
bellegarde
shook
his
head
with
sudden
gravity
my
sister
can
t
see
that
sort
of
person
madame
dandelard
is
nothing
at
all
they
would
never
i
should
think
said
newman
that
your
sister
might
see
whom
she
and
he
privately
resolved
that
after
he
knew
her
a
little
better
he
would
ask
madame
de
cintré
to
go
and
talk
to
the
foolish
little
italian
lady
after
his
dinner
with
bellegarde
on
the
occasion
i
have
mentioned
he
demurred
to
his
companion
s
proposal
that
they
should
go
again
and
listen
to
madame
dandelard
describe
her
sorrows
and
her
bruises
i
have
something
better
in
mind
he
said
come
home
with
me
and
finish
the
evening
before
my
bellegarde
always
welcomed
the
prospect
of
a
long
stretch
of
conversation
and
before
long
the
two
men
sat
watching
the
great
blaze
which
scattered
its
scintillations
over
the
high
adornments
of
newman
s
chapter
viii
tell
me
something
about
your
sister
newman
began
abruptly
bellegarde
turned
and
gave
him
a
quick
look
now
that
i
think
of
it
you
have
never
yet
asked
me
a
question
about
i
know
that
very
if
it
is
because
you
don
t
trust
me
you
are
very
right
said
bellegarde
i
can
t
talk
of
her
rationally
i
admire
her
too
talk
of
her
as
you
can
rejoined
newman
let
yourself
well
we
are
very
good
friends
we
are
such
a
brother
and
sister
as
have
not
been
seen
since
orestes
and
electra
you
have
seen
her
you
know
what
she
is
tall
thin
light
imposing
and
gentle
half
a
and
half
an
angel
a
mixture
of
pride
and
humility
of
the
eagle
and
the
dove
she
looks
like
a
statue
which
had
failed
as
stone
resigned
itself
to
its
grave
defects
and
come
to
life
as
flesh
and
blood
to
wear
white
capes
and
long
trains
all
i
can
say
is
that
she
really
possesses
every
merit
that
her
face
her
glance
her
smile
the
tone
of
her
voice
lead
you
to
expect
it
is
saying
a
great
deal
as
a
general
thing
when
a
woman
seems
very
charming
i
should
say
beware
but
in
proportion
as
claire
seems
charming
you
may
fold
your
arms
and
let
yourself
float
with
the
current
you
are
safe
she
is
so
good
i
have
never
seen
a
woman
half
so
perfect
or
so
complete
she
has
everything
that
is
all
i
can
say
about
her
there
bellegarde
concluded
i
told
you
i
should
newman
was
silent
a
while
as
if
he
were
turning
over
his
companion
s
words
she
is
very
good
eh
he
repeated
at
last
divinely
good
kind
charitable
gentle
generous
generosity
itself
kindness
is
she
clever
she
is
the
most
intelligent
woman
i
know
try
her
some
day
with
something
difficult
and
you
will
is
she
fond
of
admiration
cried
bellegarde
what
woman
is
not
ah
when
they
are
too
fond
of
admiration
they
commit
all
kinds
of
follies
to
get
i
did
not
say
she
was
too
fond
bellegarde
exclaimed
heaven
forbid
i
should
say
anything
so
idiotic
she
is
not
anything
if
i
were
to
say
she
was
ugly
i
should
not
mean
she
was
too
ugly
she
is
fond
of
pleasing
and
if
you
are
pleased
she
is
grateful
if
you
are
not
pleased
she
lets
it
pass
and
thinks
the
worst
neither
of
you
nor
of
herself
i
imagine
though
she
hopes
the
saints
in
heaven
are
for
i
am
sure
she
is
incapable
of
trying
to
please
by
any
means
of
which
they
would
is
she
grave
or
gay
asked
newman
she
is
both
not
alternately
for
she
is
always
the
same
there
is
gravity
in
her
gaiety
and
gaiety
in
her
gravity
but
there
is
no
reason
why
she
should
be
particularly
is
she
unhappy
i
won
t
say
that
for
unhappiness
is
according
as
one
takes
things
and
claire
takes
them
according
to
some
receipt
communicated
to
her
by
the
blessed
virgin
in
a
vision
to
be
unhappy
is
to
be
disagreeable
which
for
her
is
out
of
the
question
so
she
has
arranged
her
circumstances
so
as
to
be
happy
in
she
is
a
philosopher
said
newman
no
she
is
simply
a
very
nice
her
circumstances
at
any
rate
have
been
disagreeable
bellegarde
hesitated
a
moment
a
thing
he
very
rarely
did
oh
my
dear
fellow
if
i
go
into
the
history
of
my
family
i
shall
give
you
more
than
you
bargain
no
on
the
contrary
i
bargain
for
that
said
newman
we
shall
have
to
appoint
a
special
séance
then
beginning
early
suffice
it
for
the
present
that
claire
has
not
slept
on
roses
she
made
at
eighteen
a
marriage
that
was
expected
to
be
brilliant
but
that
turned
out
like
a
lamp
that
goes
out
all
smoke
and
bad
smell
de
cintré
was
sixty
years
old
and
an
odious
old
gentleman
he
lived
however
but
a
short
time
and
after
his
death
his
family
pounced
upon
his
money
brought
a
lawsuit
against
his
widow
and
pushed
things
very
hard
their
case
was
a
good
one
for
de
cintré
who
had
been
trustee
for
some
of
his
relatives
appeared
to
have
been
guilty
of
some
very
irregular
practices
in
the
course
of
the
suit
some
revelations
were
made
as
to
his
private
history
which
my
sister
found
so
displeasing
that
she
ceased
to
defend
herself
and
washed
her
hands
of
the
property
this
required
some
pluck
for
she
was
between
two
fires
her
husband
s
family
opposing
her
and
her
own
family
forcing
her
my
mother
and
my
brother
wished
her
to
cleave
to
what
they
regarded
as
her
rights
but
she
resisted
firmly
and
at
last
bought
her
freedom
obtained
my
mother
s
assent
to
dropping
the
suit
at
the
price
of
a
what
was
the
promise
to
do
anything
else
for
the
next
ten
years
that
was
asked
of
her
anything
that
is
but
she
had
disliked
her
husband
very
much
no
one
knows
how
much
the
marriage
had
been
made
in
your
horrible
french
way
newman
continued
made
by
the
two
families
without
her
having
any
voice
it
was
a
chapter
for
a
novel
she
saw
de
cintré
for
the
first
time
a
month
before
the
wedding
after
everything
to
the
minutest
detail
had
been
arranged
she
turned
white
when
she
looked
at
him
and
white
she
remained
till
her
the
evening
before
the
ceremony
she
swooned
away
and
she
spent
the
whole
night
in
sobs
my
mother
sat
holding
her
two
hands
and
my
brother
walked
up
and
down
the
room
i
declared
it
was
revolting
and
told
my
sister
publicly
that
if
she
would
refuse
downright
i
would
stand
by
her
i
was
told
to
go
about
my
business
and
she
became
comtesse
de
your
brother
said
newman
reflectively
must
be
a
very
nice
young
he
is
very
nice
though
he
is
not
young
he
is
upward
of
fifty
fifteen
years
my
senior
he
has
been
a
father
to
my
sister
and
me
he
is
a
very
remarkable
man
he
has
the
best
manners
in
france
he
is
extremely
clever
indeed
he
is
very
learned
he
is
writing
a
history
of
the
princesses
of
france
who
never
this
was
said
by
bellegarde
with
extreme
gravity
looking
straight
at
newman
and
with
an
eye
that
betokened
no
mental
reservation
or
that
at
least
almost
betokened
none
newman
perhaps
discovered
there
what
little
there
was
for
he
presently
said
you
don
t
love
your
i
beg
your
pardon
said
bellegarde
ceremoniously
people
always
love
their
well
i
don
t
love
him
then
newman
answered
wait
till
you
know
him
rejoined
bellegarde
and
this
time
he
smiled
is
your
mother
also
very
remarkable
newman
asked
after
a
pause
for
my
mother
said
bellegarde
now
with
intense
gravity
i
have
the
highest
admiration
she
is
a
very
extraordinary
woman
you
can
not
approach
her
without
perceiving
she
is
the
daughter
i
believe
of
an
english
of
the
earl
of
dunstan
is
the
earl
of
dunstan
s
a
very
old
family
the
sixteenth
century
it
is
on
my
father
s
side
that
we
go
back
back
back
back
the
family
antiquaries
themselves
lose
breath
at
last
they
stop
panting
and
fanning
themselves
somewhere
in
the
ninth
century
under
charlemagne
that
is
where
we
there
is
no
mistake
about
it
said
newman
i
m
sure
i
hope
not
we
have
been
mistaken
at
least
for
several
and
you
have
always
married
into
old
families
as
a
rule
though
in
so
long
a
stretch
of
time
there
have
been
some
exceptions
three
or
four
bellegardes
in
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
took
wives
out
of
the
married
lawyers
a
lawyer
s
daughter
that
s
very
bad
is
it
asked
newman
horrible
one
of
us
in
the
middle
ages
did
better
he
married
a
like
king
cophetua
that
was
really
better
it
was
like
marrying
a
bird
or
a
monkey
one
didn
t
have
to
think
about
her
family
at
all
our
women
have
always
done
well
they
have
never
even
gone
into
the
there
is
i
believe
not
a
case
on
record
of
a
misalliance
among
the
newman
turned
this
over
for
a
while
and
then
at
last
he
said
you
offered
the
first
time
you
came
to
see
me
to
render
me
any
service
you
could
i
told
you
that
some
time
i
would
mention
something
you
might
do
do
you
remember
remember
i
have
been
counting
the
very
well
here
s
your
chance
do
what
you
can
to
make
your
sister
think
well
of
bellegarde
stared
with
a
smile
why
i
m
sure
she
thinks
as
well
of
you
as
possible
an
opinion
founded
on
seeing
me
three
or
four
times
that
is
putting
me
off
with
very
little
i
want
something
more
i
have
been
thinking
of
it
a
good
deal
and
at
last
i
have
decided
to
tell
you
i
should
like
very
much
to
marry
madame
de
bellegarde
had
been
looking
at
him
with
quickened
expectancy
and
with
the
smile
with
which
he
had
greeted
newman
s
allusion
to
his
promised
request
at
this
last
announcement
he
continued
to
gaze
but
his
smile
went
through
two
or
three
curious
phases
it
felt
apparently
a
momentary
impulse
to
broaden
but
this
it
immediately
checked
then
it
remained
for
some
instants
taking
counsel
with
itself
at
the
end
of
which
it
decreed
a
retreat
it
slowly
effaced
itself
and
left
a
look
of
seriousness
modified
by
the
desire
not
to
be
rude
extreme
surprise
had
come
into
the
count
valentin
s
face
but
he
had
reflected
that
it
would
be
uncivil
to
leave
it
there
and
yet
what
the
deuce
was
he
to
do
with
it
he
got
up
in
his
agitation
and
stood
before
the
still
looking
at
newman
he
was
a
longer
time
thinking
what
to
say
than
one
would
have
expected
if
you
can
t
render
me
the
service
i
ask
said
newman
say
it
out
let
me
hear
it
again
distinctly
said
bellegarde
it
s
very
important
you
know
i
shall
plead
your
cause
with
my
sister
because
you
want
you
want
to
marry
her
that
s
it
eh
oh
i
don
t
say
plead
my
cause
exactly
i
shall
try
and
do
that
myself
but
say
a
good
word
for
me
now
and
then
let
her
know
that
you
think
well
of
at
this
bellegarde
gave
a
little
light
laugh
what
i
want
chiefly
after
all
newman
went
on
is
just
to
let
you
know
what
i
have
in
mind
i
suppose
that
is
what
you
expect
isn
t
it
i
want
to
do
what
is
customary
over
here
if
there
is
anything
particular
to
be
done
let
me
know
and
i
will
do
it
i
wouldn
t
for
the
world
approach
madame
de
cintré
without
all
the
proper
forms
if
i
ought
to
go
and
tell
your
mother
why
i
will
go
and
tell
her
i
will
go
and
tell
your
brother
even
i
will
go
and
tell
anyone
you
please
as
i
don
t
know
anyone
else
i
begin
by
telling
you
but
that
if
it
is
a
social
obligation
is
a
pleasure
as
yes
i
see
i
see
said
bellegarde
lightly
stroking
his
chin
you
have
a
very
right
feeling
about
it
but
i
m
glad
you
have
begun
with
he
paused
hesitated
and
then
turned
away
and
walked
slowly
the
length
of
the
room
newman
got
up
and
stood
leaning
against
the
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
watching
bellegarde
s
promenade
the
young
frenchman
came
back
and
stopped
in
front
of
him
i
give
it
up
he
said
i
will
not
pretend
i
am
not
surprised
i
am
hugely
it
s
a
that
sort
of
news
is
always
a
surprise
said
newman
no
matter
what
you
have
done
people
are
never
prepared
but
if
you
are
so
surprised
i
hope
at
least
you
are
come
said
bellegarde
i
am
going
to
be
tremendously
frank
i
don
t
know
whether
i
am
pleased
or
if
you
are
pleased
i
shall
be
glad
said
newman
and
i
shall
be
encouraged
if
you
are
horrified
i
shall
be
sorry
but
i
shall
not
be
discouraged
you
must
make
the
best
of
that
is
quite
right
that
is
your
only
possible
attitude
you
are
perfectly
serious
am
i
a
frenchman
that
i
should
not
be
asked
newman
but
why
is
it
by
the
bye
that
you
should
be
horrified
bellegarde
raised
his
hand
to
the
back
of
his
head
and
rubbed
his
hair
quickly
up
and
down
thrusting
out
the
tip
of
his
tongue
as
he
did
so
why
you
are
not
noble
for
instance
he
said
the
devil
i
am
not
exclaimed
newman
oh
said
bellegarde
a
little
more
seriously
i
did
not
know
you
had
a
a
title
what
do
you
mean
by
a
title
asked
newman
a
count
a
duke
a
marquis
i
don
t
know
anything
about
that
i
don
t
know
who
is
and
who
is
not
but
i
say
i
am
noble
i
don
t
exactly
know
what
you
mean
by
it
but
it
s
a
fine
word
and
a
fine
idea
i
put
in
a
claim
to
but
what
have
you
to
show
my
dear
fellow
what
proofs
anything
you
please
but
you
don
t
suppose
i
am
going
to
undertake
to
prove
that
i
am
noble
it
is
for
you
to
prove
the
that
s
easily
done
you
have
manufactured
newman
stared
a
moment
therefore
i
am
not
noble
i
don
t
see
it
tell
me
something
i
have
done
something
i
can
not
you
can
not
marry
a
woman
like
madame
de
cintré
for
the
i
believe
you
mean
said
newman
slowly
that
i
am
not
good
brutally
speaking
yes
bellegarde
had
hesitated
a
moment
and
while
he
hesitated
newman
s
attentive
glance
had
grown
somewhat
eager
in
answer
to
these
last
words
he
for
a
moment
said
nothing
he
simply
blushed
a
little
then
he
raised
his
eyes
to
the
ceiling
and
stood
looking
at
one
of
the
rosy
cherubs
that
was
painted
upon
it
of
course
i
don
t
expect
to
marry
any
woman
for
the
asking
he
said
at
last
i
expect
first
to
make
myself
acceptable
to
her
she
must
like
me
to
begin
with
but
that
i
am
not
good
enough
to
make
a
trial
is
rather
a
bellegarde
wore
a
look
of
mingled
perplexity
sympathy
and
amusement
you
should
not
hesitate
then
to
go
up
and
ask
a
duchess
to
marry
you
not
if
i
thought
she
would
suit
me
but
i
am
very
fastidious
she
might
not
at
bellegarde
s
amusement
began
to
prevail
and
you
should
be
surprised
if
she
refused
you
newman
hesitated
a
moment
it
sounds
conceited
to
say
yes
but
nevertheless
i
think
i
should
for
i
should
make
a
very
handsome
what
would
it
be
everything
she
wishes
if
i
get
hold
of
a
woman
that
comes
up
to
my
standard
i
shall
think
nothing
too
good
for
her
i
have
been
a
long
time
looking
and
i
find
such
women
are
rare
to
combine
the
qualities
i
require
seems
to
be
difficult
but
when
the
difficulty
is
vanquished
it
deserves
a
reward
my
wife
shall
have
a
good
position
and
i
m
not
afraid
to
say
that
i
shall
be
a
good
and
these
qualities
that
you
require
what
are
they
goodness
beauty
intelligence
a
fine
education
personal
elegance
everything
in
a
word
that
makes
a
splendid
and
noble
birth
evidently
said
bellegarde
oh
throw
that
in
by
all
means
if
it
s
there
the
more
the
better
and
my
sister
seems
to
you
to
have
all
these
things
she
is
exactly
what
i
have
been
looking
for
she
is
my
dream
and
you
would
make
her
a
very
good
husband
that
is
what
i
wanted
you
to
tell
bellegarde
laid
his
hand
on
his
companion
s
arm
a
moment
looked
at
him
with
his
head
on
one
side
from
head
to
foot
and
then
with
a
loud
laugh
and
shaking
the
other
hand
in
the
air
turned
away
he
walked
again
the
length
of
the
room
and
again
he
came
back
and
stationed
himself
in
front
of
newman
all
this
is
very
interesting
it
is
very
curious
in
what
i
said
just
now
i
was
speaking
not
for
myself
but
for
my
tradition
my
superstitions
for
myself
really
your
proposal
tickles
me
it
startled
me
at
first
but
the
more
i
think
of
it
the
more
i
see
in
it
it
s
no
use
attempting
to
explain
anything
you
won
t
understand
me
after
all
i
don
t
see
why
you
need
it
s
no
great
oh
if
there
is
anything
more
to
explain
try
it
i
want
to
proceed
with
my
eyes
open
i
will
do
my
best
to
no
said
bellegarde
it
s
disagreeable
to
me
i
give
it
up
i
liked
you
the
first
time
i
saw
you
and
i
will
abide
by
that
it
would
be
quite
odious
for
me
to
come
talking
to
you
as
if
i
could
patronize
you
i
have
told
you
before
that
i
envy
you
m
as
we
say
i
didn
t
know
you
much
until
within
five
minutes
so
we
will
let
things
go
and
i
will
say
nothing
to
you
that
if
our
positions
were
reversed
you
would
not
say
to
i
do
not
know
whether
in
renouncing
the
mysterious
opportunity
to
which
he
alluded
bellegarde
felt
that
he
was
doing
something
very
generous
if
so
he
was
not
rewarded
his
generosity
was
not
appreciated
newman
quite
failed
to
recognize
the
young
frenchman
s
power
to
wound
his
feelings
and
he
had
now
no
sense
of
escaping
or
coming
off
easily
he
did
not
thank
his
companion
even
with
a
glance
my
eyes
are
open
though
he
said
so
far
as
that
you
have
practically
told
me
that
your
family
and
your
friends
will
turn
up
their
noses
at
me
i
have
never
thought
much
about
the
reasons
that
make
it
proper
for
people
to
turn
up
their
noses
and
so
i
can
only
decide
the
question
looking
at
it
in
that
way
i
can
t
see
anything
in
it
i
simply
think
if
you
want
to
know
that
i
m
as
good
as
the
best
who
the
best
are
i
don
t
pretend
to
say
i
have
never
thought
much
about
that
either
to
tell
the
truth
i
have
always
had
rather
a
good
opinion
of
myself
a
man
who
is
successful
can
t
help
it
but
i
will
admit
that
i
was
conceited
what
i
don
t
say
yes
to
is
that
i
don
t
stand
high
as
high
as
anyone
else
this
is
a
line
of
speculation
i
should
not
have
chosen
but
you
must
remember
you
began
it
yourself
i
should
never
have
dreamed
that
i
was
on
the
defensive
or
that
i
had
to
justify
myself
but
if
your
people
will
have
it
so
i
will
do
my
but
you
offered
a
while
ago
to
make
your
court
as
we
say
to
my
mother
and
my
damn
it
cried
newman
i
want
to
be
good
rejoined
bellegarde
this
will
go
far
it
will
be
very
entertaining
excuse
my
speaking
of
it
in
that
fashion
but
the
matter
must
of
necessity
be
for
me
something
of
a
spectacle
it
s
positively
exciting
but
apart
from
that
i
sympathize
with
you
and
i
shall
be
actor
so
far
as
i
can
as
well
as
spectator
you
are
a
capital
fellow
i
believe
in
you
and
i
back
you
the
simple
fact
that
you
appreciate
my
sister
will
serve
as
the
proof
i
was
asking
for
all
men
are
equal
especially
men
of
taste
do
you
think
asked
newman
presently
that
madame
de
cintré
is
determined
not
to
marry
that
is
my
impression
but
that
is
not
against
you
it
s
for
you
to
make
her
change
her
i
am
afraid
it
will
be
hard
said
newman
gravely
i
don
t
think
it
will
be
easy
in
a
general
way
i
don
t
see
why
a
widow
should
ever
marry
again
she
has
gained
the
benefits
of
matrimony
freedom
and
consideration
and
she
has
got
rid
of
the
drawbacks
why
should
she
put
her
head
into
the
noose
again
her
usual
motive
is
ambition
if
a
man
can
offer
her
a
great
position
make
her
a
princess
or
an
ambassadress
she
may
think
the
compensation
and
in
that
way
is
madame
de
cintré
ambitious
who
knows
said
bellegarde
with
a
profound
shrug
i
don
t
pretend
to
say
all
that
she
is
or
all
that
she
is
not
i
think
she
might
be
touched
by
the
prospect
of
becoming
the
wife
of
a
great
man
but
in
a
certain
way
i
believe
whatever
she
does
will
be
the
don
t
be
too
confident
but
don
t
absolutely
doubt
your
best
chance
for
success
will
be
precisely
in
being
to
her
mind
unusual
unexpected
original
don
t
try
to
be
anyone
else
be
simply
yourself
out
and
out
something
or
other
can
t
fail
to
come
of
it
i
am
very
curious
to
see
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
advice
said
newman
and
he
added
with
a
smile
i
am
glad
for
your
sake
i
am
going
to
be
so
it
will
be
more
than
amusing
said
bellegarde
it
will
be
inspiring
i
look
at
it
from
my
point
of
view
and
you
from
yours
after
all
anything
for
a
change
and
only
yesterday
i
was
yawning
so
as
to
dislocate
my
jaw
and
declaring
that
there
was
nothing
new
under
the
sun
if
it
isn
t
new
to
see
you
come
into
the
family
as
a
suitor
i
am
very
much
mistaken
let
me
say
that
my
dear
fellow
i
won
t
call
it
anything
else
bad
or
good
i
will
simply
call
it
and
overcome
with
a
sense
of
the
novelty
thus
foreshadowed
valentin
de
bellegarde
threw
himself
into
a
deep
armchair
before
the
fire
and
with
a
fixed
intense
smile
seemed
to
read
a
vision
of
it
in
the
flame
of
the
logs
after
a
while
he
looked
up
go
ahead
my
boy
you
have
my
good
wishes
he
said
but
it
is
really
a
pity
you
don
t
understand
me
that
you
don
t
know
just
what
i
am
oh
said
newman
laughing
don
t
do
anything
wrong
leave
me
to
myself
rather
or
defy
me
out
and
out
i
wouldn
t
lay
any
load
on
your
bellegarde
sprang
up
again
he
was
evidently
excited
there
was
a
warmer
spark
even
than
usual
in
his
eye
you
never
will
understand
you
never
will
know
he
said
and
if
you
succeed
and
i
turn
out
to
have
helped
you
you
will
never
be
grateful
not
as
i
shall
deserve
you
should
be
you
will
be
an
excellent
fellow
always
but
you
will
not
be
grateful
but
it
doesn
t
matter
for
i
shall
get
my
own
fun
out
of
and
he
broke
into
an
extravagant
laugh
you
look
puzzled
he
added
you
look
almost
it
a
pity
said
newman
that
i
don
t
understand
you
i
shall
lose
some
very
good
i
told
you
you
remember
that
we
were
very
strange
people
bellegarde
went
on
i
give
you
warning
again
we
are
my
mother
is
strange
my
brother
is
strange
and
i
verily
believe
that
i
am
stranger
than
either
you
will
even
find
my
sister
a
little
strange
old
trees
have
crooked
branches
old
houses
have
queer
cracks
old
races
have
odd
secrets
remember
that
we
are
eight
hundred
years
old
very
good
said
newman
that
s
the
sort
of
thing
i
came
to
europe
for
you
come
into
my
then
said
bellegarde
putting
out
his
hand
it
s
a
bargain
i
accept
you
i
espouse
your
cause
it
s
because
i
like
you
in
a
great
measure
but
that
is
not
the
only
reason
and
he
stood
holding
newman
s
hand
and
looking
at
him
askance
what
is
the
other
one
i
am
in
the
opposition
i
dislike
someone
your
brother
asked
newman
in
his
unmodulated
voice
bellegarde
laid
his
fingers
upon
his
lips
with
a
whispered
old
races
have
strange
secrets
he
said
put
yourself
into
motion
come
and
see
my
sister
and
be
assured
of
my
sympathy
and
on
this
he
took
his
leave
newman
dropped
into
a
chair
before
his
fire
and
sat
a
long
time
staring
into
the
blaze
chapter
ix
he
went
to
see
madame
de
cintré
the
next
day
and
was
informed
by
the
servant
that
she
was
at
home
he
passed
as
usual
up
the
large
cold
staircase
and
through
a
spacious
vestibule
above
where
the
walls
seemed
all
composed
of
small
door
panels
touched
with
gilding
whence
he
was
ushered
into
the
in
which
he
had
already
been
received
it
was
empty
and
the
servant
told
him
that
madame
la
comtesse
would
presently
appear
he
had
time
while
he
waited
to
wonder
whether
bellegarde
had
seen
his
sister
since
the
evening
before
and
whether
in
this
case
he
had
spoken
to
her
of
their
talk
in
this
case
madame
de
cintré
s
receiving
him
was
an
encouragement
he
felt
a
certain
trepidation
as
he
reflected
that
she
might
come
in
with
the
knowledge
of
his
supreme
admiration
and
of
the
project
he
had
built
upon
it
in
her
eyes
but
the
feeling
was
not
disagreeable
her
face
could
wear
no
look
that
would
make
it
less
beautiful
and
he
was
sure
beforehand
that
however
she
might
take
the
proposal
he
had
in
reserve
she
would
not
take
it
in
scorn
or
in
irony
he
had
a
feeling
that
if
she
could
only
read
the
bottom
of
his
heart
and
measure
the
extent
of
his
good
will
toward
her
she
would
be
entirely
kind
she
came
in
at
last
after
so
long
an
interval
that
he
wondered
whether
she
had
been
hesitating
she
smiled
with
her
usual
frankness
and
held
out
her
hand
she
looked
at
him
straight
with
her
soft
and
luminous
eyes
and
said
without
a
tremor
in
her
voice
that
she
was
glad
to
see
him
and
that
she
hoped
he
was
well
he
found
in
her
what
he
had
found
before
that
faint
perfume
of
a
personal
shyness
worn
away
by
contact
with
the
world
but
the
more
perceptible
the
more
closely
you
approached
her
this
lingering
diffidence
seemed
to
give
a
peculiar
value
to
what
was
definite
and
assured
in
her
manner
it
made
it
seem
like
an
accomplishment
a
beautiful
talent
something
that
one
might
compare
to
an
exquisite
touch
in
a
pianist
it
was
in
fact
madame
de
cintré
s
authority
as
they
say
of
artists
that
especially
impressed
and
fascinated
newman
he
always
came
back
to
the
feeling
that
when
he
should
complete
himself
by
taking
a
wife
that
was
the
way
he
should
like
his
wife
to
interpret
him
to
the
world
the
only
trouble
indeed
was
that
when
the
instrument
was
so
perfect
it
seemed
to
interpose
too
much
between
you
and
the
genius
that
used
it
madame
de
cintré
gave
newman
the
sense
of
an
elaborate
education
of
her
having
passed
through
mysterious
ceremonies
and
processes
of
culture
in
her
youth
of
her
having
been
fashioned
and
made
flexible
to
certain
exalted
social
needs
all
this
as
i
have
affirmed
made
her
seem
rare
and
precious
a
very
expensive
article
as
he
would
have
said
and
one
which
a
man
with
an
ambition
to
have
everything
about
him
of
the
best
would
find
it
highly
agreeable
to
possess
but
looking
at
the
matter
with
an
eye
to
private
felicity
newman
wondered
where
in
so
exquisite
a
compound
nature
and
art
showed
their
dividing
line
where
did
the
special
intention
separate
from
the
habit
of
good
manners
where
did
urbanity
end
and
sincerity
begin
newman
asked
himself
these
questions
even
while
he
stood
ready
to
accept
the
admired
object
in
all
its
complexity
he
felt
that
he
could
do
so
in
profound
security
and
examine
its
mechanism
afterwards
at
leisure
i
am
very
glad
to
find
you
alone
he
said
you
know
i
have
never
had
such
good
luck
but
you
have
seemed
before
very
well
contented
with
your
luck
said
madame
de
cintré
you
have
sat
and
watched
my
visitors
with
an
air
of
quiet
amusement
what
have
you
thought
of
them
oh
i
have
thought
the
ladies
were
very
elegant
and
very
graceful
and
wonderfully
quick
at
repartee
but
what
i
have
chiefly
thought
has
been
that
they
only
helped
me
to
admire
this
was
not
gallantry
on
newman
s
part
an
art
in
which
he
was
quite
unversed
it
was
simply
the
instinct
of
the
practical
man
who
had
made
up
his
mind
what
he
wanted
and
was
now
beginning
to
take
active
steps
to
obtain
it
madame
de
cintré
started
slightly
and
raised
her
eyebrows
she
had
evidently
not
expected
so
fervid
a
compliment
oh
in
that
case
she
said
with
a
laugh
your
finding
me
alone
is
not
good
luck
for
me
i
hope
someone
will
come
in
i
hope
not
said
newman
i
have
something
particular
to
say
to
you
have
you
seen
your
brother
yes
i
saw
him
an
hour
did
he
tell
you
that
he
had
seen
me
last
night
he
said
and
did
he
tell
you
what
we
had
talked
about
madame
de
cintré
hesitated
a
moment
as
newman
asked
these
questions
she
had
grown
a
little
pale
as
if
she
regarded
what
was
coming
as
necessary
but
not
as
agreeable
did
you
give
him
a
message
to
me
she
asked
it
was
not
exactly
a
message
i
asked
him
to
render
me
a
the
service
was
to
sing
your
praises
was
it
not
and
she
accompanied
this
question
with
a
little
smile
as
if
to
make
it
easier
to
herself
yes
that
is
what
it
really
amounts
to
said
newman
did
he
sing
my
praises
he
spoke
very
well
of
you
but
when
i
know
that
it
was
by
your
special
request
of
course
i
must
take
his
eulogy
with
a
grain
of
oh
that
makes
no
difference
said
newman
your
brother
would
not
have
spoken
well
of
me
unless
he
believed
what
he
was
saying
he
is
too
honest
for
are
you
very
deep
said
madame
de
cintré
are
you
trying
to
please
me
by
praising
my
brother
i
confess
it
is
a
good
for
me
any
way
that
succeeds
will
be
good
i
will
praise
your
brother
all
day
if
that
will
help
me
he
is
a
noble
little
fellow
he
has
made
me
feel
in
promising
to
do
what
he
can
to
help
me
that
i
can
depend
upon
don
t
make
too
much
of
that
said
madame
de
cintré
he
can
help
you
very
of
course
i
must
work
my
way
myself
i
know
that
very
well
i
only
want
a
chance
to
in
consenting
to
see
me
after
what
he
told
you
you
almost
seem
to
be
giving
me
a
i
am
seeing
you
said
madame
de
cintré
slowly
and
gravely
because
i
promised
my
brother
i
blessings
on
your
brother
s
head
cried
newman
what
i
told
him
last
evening
was
this
that
i
admired
you
more
than
any
woman
i
had
ever
seen
and
that
i
should
like
immensely
to
make
you
my
he
uttered
these
words
with
great
directness
and
firmness
and
without
any
sense
of
confusion
he
was
full
of
his
idea
he
had
completely
mastered
it
and
he
seemed
to
look
down
on
madame
de
cintré
with
all
her
gathered
elegance
from
the
height
of
his
bracing
good
conscience
it
is
probable
that
this
particular
tone
and
manner
were
the
very
best
he
could
have
hit
upon
yet
the
light
just
visibly
forced
smile
with
which
his
companion
had
listened
to
him
died
away
and
she
sat
looking
at
him
with
her
lips
parted
and
her
face
as
solemn
as
a
tragic
mask
there
was
evidently
something
very
painful
to
her
in
the
scene
to
which
he
was
subjecting
her
and
yet
her
impatience
of
it
found
no
angry
voice
newman
wondered
whether
he
was
hurting
her
he
could
not
imagine
why
the
liberal
devotion
he
meant
to
express
should
be
disagreeable
he
got
up
and
stood
before
her
leaning
one
hand
on
the
i
know
i
have
seen
you
very
little
to
say
this
he
said
so
little
that
it
may
make
what
i
say
seem
disrespectful
that
is
my
misfortune
i
could
have
said
it
the
first
time
i
saw
you
really
i
had
seen
you
before
i
had
seen
you
in
imagination
you
seemed
almost
an
old
friend
so
what
i
say
is
not
mere
gallantry
and
compliments
and
nonsense
i
can
t
talk
that
way
i
don
t
know
how
and
i
wouldn
t
to
you
if
i
could
it
s
as
serious
as
such
words
can
be
i
feel
as
if
i
knew
you
and
knew
what
a
beautiful
admirable
woman
you
are
i
shall
know
better
perhaps
some
day
but
i
have
a
general
notion
now
you
are
just
the
woman
i
have
been
looking
for
except
that
you
are
far
more
perfect
i
won
t
make
any
protestations
and
vows
but
you
can
trust
me
it
is
very
soon
i
know
to
say
all
this
it
is
almost
offensive
but
why
not
gain
time
if
one
can
and
if
you
want
time
to
reflect
of
course
you
do
the
sooner
you
begin
the
better
for
me
i
don
t
know
what
you
think
of
me
but
there
is
no
great
mystery
about
me
you
see
what
i
am
your
brother
told
me
that
my
antecedents
and
occupations
were
against
me
that
your
family
stands
somehow
on
a
higher
level
than
i
do
that
is
an
idea
which
of
course
i
don
t
understand
and
don
t
accept
but
you
don
t
care
anything
about
that
i
can
assure
you
that
i
am
a
very
solid
fellow
and
that
if
i
give
my
mind
to
it
i
can
arrange
things
so
that
in
a
very
few
years
i
shall
not
need
to
waste
time
in
explaining
who
i
am
and
what
i
am
you
will
decide
for
yourself
whether
you
like
me
or
not
what
there
is
you
see
before
you
i
honestly
believe
i
have
no
hidden
vices
or
nasty
tricks
i
am
kind
kind
kind
everything
that
a
man
can
give
a
woman
i
will
give
you
i
have
a
large
fortune
a
very
large
fortune
some
day
if
you
will
allow
me
i
will
go
into
details
if
you
want
brilliancy
everything
in
the
way
of
brilliancy
that
money
can
give
you
you
shall
have
and
as
regards
anything
you
may
give
up
don
t
take
for
granted
too
much
that
its
place
can
not
be
filled
leave
that
to
me
i
ll
take
care
of
you
i
shall
know
what
you
need
energy
and
ingenuity
can
arrange
everything
i
m
a
strong
man
there
i
have
said
what
i
had
on
my
heart
it
was
better
to
get
it
off
i
am
very
sorry
if
it
s
disagreeable
to
you
but
think
how
much
better
it
is
that
things
should
be
clear
don
t
answer
me
now
if
you
don
t
wish
it
think
about
it
think
about
it
as
slowly
as
you
please
of
course
i
haven
t
said
i
can
t
say
half
i
mean
especially
about
my
admiration
for
you
but
take
a
favorable
view
of
me
it
will
only
be
during
this
speech
the
longest
that
newman
had
ever
made
madame
de
cintré
kept
her
gaze
fixed
upon
him
and
it
expanded
at
the
last
into
a
sort
of
fascinated
stare
when
he
ceased
speaking
she
lowered
her
eyes
and
sat
for
some
moments
looking
down
and
straight
before
her
then
she
slowly
rose
to
her
feet
and
a
pair
of
exceptionally
keen
eyes
would
have
perceived
that
she
was
trembling
a
little
in
the
movement
she
still
looked
extremely
serious
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
offer
she
said
it
seems
very
strange
but
i
am
glad
you
spoke
without
waiting
any
longer
it
is
better
the
subject
should
be
dismissed
i
appreciate
all
you
say
you
do
me
great
honor
but
i
have
decided
not
to
oh
don
t
say
that
cried
newman
in
a
tone
absolutely
from
its
pleading
and
caressing
cadence
she
had
turned
away
and
it
made
her
stop
a
moment
with
her
back
to
him
think
better
of
that
you
are
too
young
too
beautiful
too
much
made
to
be
happy
and
to
make
others
happy
if
you
are
afraid
of
losing
your
freedom
i
can
assure
you
that
this
freedom
here
this
life
you
now
lead
is
a
dreary
bondage
to
what
i
will
offer
you
you
shall
do
things
that
i
don
t
think
you
have
ever
thought
of
i
will
take
you
anywhere
in
the
wide
world
that
you
propose
are
you
unhappy
you
give
me
a
feeling
that
you
unhappy
you
have
no
right
to
be
or
to
be
made
so
let
me
come
in
and
put
an
end
to
madame
de
cintré
stood
there
a
moment
longer
looking
away
from
him
if
she
was
touched
by
the
way
he
spoke
the
thing
was
conceivable
his
voice
always
very
mild
and
interrogative
gradually
became
as
soft
and
as
tenderly
argumentative
as
if
he
had
been
talking
to
a
child
he
stood
watching
her
and
she
presently
turned
round
again
but
this
time
she
did
not
look
at
him
and
she
spoke
in
a
quietness
in
which
there
was
a
visible
trace
of
effort
there
are
a
great
many
reasons
why
i
should
not
marry
she
said
more
than
i
can
explain
to
you
as
for
my
happiness
i
am
very
happy
your
offer
seems
strange
to
me
for
more
reasons
also
than
i
can
say
of
course
you
have
a
perfect
right
to
make
it
but
i
can
not
accept
it
it
is
impossible
please
never
speak
of
this
matter
again
if
you
can
not
promise
me
this
i
must
ask
you
not
to
come
why
is
it
impossible
newman
demanded
you
may
think
it
is
at
first
without
its
really
being
so
i
didn
t
expect
you
to
be
pleased
at
first
but
i
do
believe
that
if
you
will
think
of
it
a
good
while
you
may
be
i
don
t
know
you
said
madame
de
cintré
think
how
little
i
know
very
little
of
course
and
therefore
i
don
t
ask
for
your
ultimatum
on
the
spot
i
only
ask
you
not
to
say
no
and
to
let
me
hope
i
will
wait
as
long
as
you
desire
meanwhile
you
can
see
more
of
me
and
know
me
better
look
at
me
as
a
possible
husband
as
a
candidate
and
make
up
your
something
was
going
on
rapidly
in
madame
de
cintré
s
thoughts
she
was
weighing
a
question
there
beneath
newman
s
eyes
weighing
it
and
deciding
it
from
the
moment
i
don
t
very
respectfully
beg
you
to
leave
the
house
and
never
return
she
said
i
listen
to
you
i
seem
to
give
you
hope
i
listened
to
you
against
my
judgment
it
is
because
you
are
eloquent
if
i
had
been
told
this
morning
that
i
should
consent
to
consider
you
as
a
possible
husband
i
should
have
thought
my
informant
a
little
crazy
i
listening
to
you
you
see
and
she
threw
her
hands
out
for
a
moment
and
let
them
drop
with
a
gesture
in
which
there
was
just
the
slightest
expression
of
appealing
weakness
well
as
far
as
saying
goes
i
have
said
everything
said
newman
i
believe
in
you
without
restriction
and
i
think
all
the
good
of
you
that
it
is
possible
to
think
of
a
human
creature
i
firmly
believe
that
in
marrying
me
you
will
be
as
i
said
just
now
he
went
on
with
a
smile
i
have
no
bad
ways
i
can
so
much
for
you
and
if
you
are
afraid
that
i
am
not
what
you
have
been
accustomed
to
not
refined
and
delicate
and
punctilious
you
may
easily
carry
that
too
far
i
delicate
you
shall
see
madame
de
cintré
walked
some
distance
away
and
paused
before
a
great
plant
an
azalea
which
was
flourishing
in
a
porcelain
tub
before
her
window
she
plucked
off
one
of
the
flowers
and
twisting
it
in
her
fingers
retraced
her
steps
then
she
sat
down
in
silence
and
her
attitude
seemed
to
be
a
consent
that
newman
should
say
more
why
should
you
say
it
is
impossible
you
should
marry
he
continued
the
only
thing
that
could
make
it
really
impossible
would
be
your
being
already
married
is
it
because
you
have
been
unhappy
in
marriage
that
is
all
the
more
reason
is
it
because
your
family
exert
a
pressure
upon
you
interfere
with
you
annoy
you
that
is
still
another
reason
you
ought
to
be
perfectly
free
and
marriage
will
make
you
so
i
don
t
say
anything
against
your
family
understand
that
added
newman
with
an
eagerness
which
might
have
made
a
perspicacious
observer
smile
whatever
way
you
feel
toward
them
is
the
right
way
and
anything
that
you
should
wish
me
to
do
to
make
myself
agreeable
to
them
i
will
do
as
well
as
i
know
how
depend
upon
that
madame
de
cintré
rose
again
and
came
toward
the
fireplace
near
which
newman
was
standing
the
expression
of
pain
and
embarrassment
had
passed
out
of
her
face
and
it
was
illuminated
with
something
which
this
time
at
least
newman
need
not
have
been
perplexed
whether
to
attribute
to
habit
or
to
intention
to
art
or
to
nature
she
had
the
air
of
a
woman
who
has
stepped
across
the
frontier
of
friendship
and
looking
around
her
finds
the
region
vast
a
certain
checked
and
controlled
exaltation
seemed
mingled
with
the
usual
level
radiance
of
her
glance
i
will
not
refuse
to
see
you
again
she
said
because
much
of
what
you
have
said
has
given
me
pleasure
but
i
will
see
you
only
on
this
condition
that
you
say
nothing
more
in
the
same
way
for
a
long
for
how
long
for
six
months
it
must
be
a
solemn
very
well
i
then
she
said
and
extended
her
hand
he
held
it
a
moment
as
if
he
were
going
to
say
something
more
but
he
only
looked
at
her
then
he
took
his
departure
that
evening
on
the
boulevard
he
met
valentin
de
bellegarde
after
they
had
exchanged
greetings
newman
told
him
that
he
had
seen
madame
de
cintré
a
few
hours
before
i
know
it
said
bellegarde
i
dined
in
the
rue
de
l
and
then
for
some
moments
both
men
were
silent
newman
wished
to
ask
bellegarde
what
visible
impression
his
visit
had
made
and
the
count
valentin
had
a
question
of
his
own
bellegarde
spoke
first
it
s
none
of
my
business
but
what
the
deuce
did
you
say
to
my
sister
i
am
willing
to
tell
you
said
newman
that
i
made
her
an
offer
of
already
and
the
young
man
gave
a
whistle
time
is
money
is
that
what
you
say
in
america
and
madame
de
cintré
he
added
with
an
interrogative
inflection
she
did
not
accept
my
she
couldn
t
you
know
in
that
but
i
m
to
see
her
again
said
newman
oh
the
strangeness
of
woman
exclaimed
bellegarde
then
he
stopped
and
held
newman
off
at
arms
i
look
at
you
with
respect
he
exclaimed
you
have
achieved
what
we
call
a
personal
success
immediately
now
i
must
present
you
to
my
whenever
you
please
said
newman
chapter
x
newman
continued
to
see
his
friends
the
tristrams
with
a
good
deal
of
frequency
though
if
you
had
listened
to
tristram
s
account
of
the
matter
you
would
have
supposed
that
they
had
been
cynically
repudiated
for
the
sake
of
grander
acquaintance
we
were
all
very
well
so
long
as
we
had
no
rivals
we
were
better
than
nothing
but
now
that
you
have
become
the
fashion
and
have
your
pick
every
day
of
three
invitations
to
dinner
we
are
tossed
into
the
corner
i
am
sure
it
is
very
good
of
you
to
come
and
see
us
once
a
month
i
wonder
you
don
t
send
us
your
cards
in
an
envelope
when
you
do
pray
have
them
with
black
edges
it
will
be
for
the
death
of
my
last
it
was
in
this
incisive
strain
that
tristram
moralized
over
newman
s
neglect
which
was
in
reality
a
most
exemplary
constancy
of
course
she
was
joking
but
there
was
always
something
ironical
in
her
jokes
as
there
was
always
something
jocular
in
her
gravity
i
know
no
better
proof
that
i
have
treated
you
very
well
newman
had
said
than
the
fact
that
you
make
so
free
with
my
character
familiarity
breeds
contempt
i
have
made
myself
too
cheap
if
i
had
a
little
proper
pride
i
would
stay
away
a
while
and
when
you
asked
me
to
dinner
say
i
was
going
to
the
princess
borealska
s
but
i
have
not
any
pride
where
my
pleasure
is
concerned
and
to
keep
you
in
the
humor
to
see
me
if
you
must
see
me
only
to
call
me
bad
names
i
will
agree
to
anything
you
choose
i
will
admit
that
i
am
the
biggest
snob
in
newman
in
fact
had
declined
an
invitation
personally
given
by
the
princess
borealska
an
inquiring
polish
lady
to
whom
he
had
been
presented
on
the
ground
that
on
that
particular
day
he
always
dined
at
tristram
s
and
it
was
only
a
tenderly
perverse
theory
of
his
hostess
of
the
avenue
d
iéna
that
he
was
faithless
to
his
early
friendships
she
needed
the
theory
to
explain
a
certain
moral
irritation
by
which
she
was
often
visited
though
if
this
explanation
was
unsound
a
deeper
analyst
than
i
must
give
the
right
one
having
launched
our
hero
upon
the
current
which
was
bearing
him
so
rapidly
along
she
appeared
but
at
its
swiftness
she
had
succeeded
too
well
she
had
played
her
game
too
cleverly
and
she
wished
to
mix
up
the
cards
newman
had
told
her
in
due
season
that
her
friend
was
the
epithet
was
not
romantic
but
tristram
had
no
difficulty
in
perceiving
that
in
essentials
the
feeling
which
lay
beneath
it
was
indeed
the
mild
expansive
brevity
with
which
it
was
uttered
and
a
certain
look
at
once
appealing
and
inscrutable
that
issued
from
newman
s
eyes
as
he
leaned
his
head
against
the
back
of
his
chair
seemed
to
her
the
most
eloquent
attestation
of
a
mature
sentiment
that
she
had
ever
encountered
newman
was
according
to
the
french
phrase
only
abounding
in
her
own
sense
but
his
temperate
raptures
exerted
a
singular
effect
upon
the
ardor
which
she
herself
had
so
freely
manifested
a
few
months
before
she
now
seemed
inclined
to
take
a
purely
critical
view
of
madame
de
cintré
and
wished
to
have
it
understood
that
she
did
not
in
the
least
answer
for
her
being
a
compendium
of
all
the
virtues
no
woman
was
ever
so
good
as
that
woman
seems
she
said
remember
what
shakespeare
calls
desdemona
a
supersubtle
madame
de
cintré
is
a
supersubtle
parisian
she
is
a
charming
woman
and
she
has
five
hundred
merits
but
you
had
better
keep
that
in
was
tristram
simply
finding
out
that
she
was
jealous
of
her
dear
friend
on
the
other
side
of
the
seine
and
that
in
undertaking
to
provide
newman
with
an
ideal
wife
she
had
counted
too
much
on
her
own
disinterestedness
we
may
be
permitted
to
doubt
it
the
inconsistent
little
lady
of
the
avenue
d
iéna
had
an
insuperable
need
of
changing
her
place
intellectually
she
had
a
lively
imagination
and
she
was
capable
at
certain
times
of
imagining
the
direct
reverse
of
her
most
cherished
beliefs
with
a
vividness
more
intense
than
that
of
conviction
she
got
tired
of
thinking
aright
but
there
was
no
serious
harm
in
it
as
she
got
equally
tired
of
thinking
wrong
in
the
midst
of
her
mysterious
perversities
she
had
admirable
flashes
of
justice
one
of
these
occurred
when
newman
related
to
her
that
he
had
made
a
formal
proposal
to
madame
de
cintré
he
repeated
in
a
few
words
what
he
had
said
and
in
a
great
many
what
she
had
answered
tristram
listened
with
extreme
interest
but
after
all
said
newman
there
is
nothing
to
congratulate
me
upon
it
is
not
a
i
beg
your
pardon
said
tristram
it
is
a
great
triumph
it
is
a
great
triumph
that
she
did
not
silence
you
at
the
first
word
and
request
you
never
to
speak
to
her
i
don
t
see
that
observed
newman
of
course
you
don
t
heaven
forbid
you
should
when
i
told
you
to
go
on
your
own
way
and
do
what
came
into
your
head
i
had
no
idea
you
would
go
over
the
ground
so
fast
i
never
dreamed
you
would
offer
yourself
after
five
or
six
as
yet
what
had
you
done
to
make
her
like
you
you
had
simply
sat
not
very
straight
and
stared
at
her
but
she
does
like
that
remains
to
be
no
that
is
proved
what
will
come
of
it
remains
to
be
seen
that
you
should
propose
to
marry
her
without
more
ado
could
never
have
come
into
her
head
you
can
form
very
little
idea
of
what
passed
through
her
mind
as
you
spoke
if
she
ever
really
marries
you
the
affair
will
be
characterized
by
the
usual
justice
of
all
human
beings
towards
women
you
will
think
you
take
generous
views
of
her
but
you
will
never
begin
to
know
through
what
a
strange
sea
of
feeling
she
passed
before
she
accepted
you
as
she
stood
there
in
front
of
you
the
other
day
she
plunged
into
it
she
said
why
not
to
something
which
a
few
hours
earlier
had
been
inconceivable
she
turned
about
on
a
thousand
gathered
prejudices
and
traditions
as
on
a
pivot
and
looked
where
she
had
never
looked
hitherto
when
i
think
of
it
when
i
think
of
claire
de
cintré
and
all
that
she
represents
there
seems
to
me
something
very
fine
in
it
when
i
recommended
you
to
try
your
fortune
with
her
i
of
course
thought
well
of
you
and
in
spite
of
your
sins
i
think
so
still
but
i
confess
i
don
t
see
quite
what
you
are
and
what
you
have
done
to
make
such
a
woman
do
this
sort
of
thing
for
oh
there
is
something
very
fine
in
it
said
newman
with
a
laugh
repeating
her
words
he
took
an
extreme
satisfaction
in
hearing
that
there
was
something
fine
in
it
he
had
not
the
least
doubt
of
it
himself
but
he
had
already
begun
to
value
the
world
s
admiration
of
madame
de
cintré
as
adding
to
the
prospective
glory
of
possession
it
was
immediately
after
this
conversation
that
valentin
de
bellegarde
came
to
conduct
his
friend
to
the
rue
de
l
université
to
present
him
to
the
other
members
of
his
family
you
are
already
introduced
he
said
and
you
have
begun
to
be
talked
about
my
sister
has
mentioned
your
successive
visits
to
my
mother
and
it
was
an
accident
that
my
mother
was
present
at
none
of
them
i
have
spoken
of
you
as
an
american
of
immense
wealth
and
the
best
fellow
in
the
world
who
is
looking
for
something
very
superior
in
the
way
of
a
do
you
suppose
asked
newman
that
madame
de
cintré
has
related
to
your
mother
the
last
conversation
i
had
with
her
i
am
very
certain
that
she
has
not
she
will
keep
her
own
counsel
meanwhile
you
must
make
your
way
with
the
rest
of
the
family
thus
much
is
known
about
you
you
have
made
a
great
fortune
in
trade
you
are
a
little
eccentric
and
you
frankly
admire
our
dear
claire
my
whom
you
remember
seeing
in
madame
de
cintré
s
took
it
appears
a
fancy
to
you
she
has
described
you
as
having
de
my
mother
therefore
is
curious
to
see
she
expects
to
laugh
at
me
eh
said
newman
she
never
laughs
if
she
does
not
like
you
don
t
hope
to
purchase
favor
by
being
amusing
take
warning
by
me
this
conversation
took
place
in
the
evening
and
half
an
hour
later
valentin
ushered
his
companion
into
an
apartment
of
the
house
of
the
rue
de
l
université
into
which
he
had
not
yet
penetrated
the
salon
of
the
dowager
marquise
de
bellegarde
it
was
a
vast
high
room
with
elaborate
and
ponderous
mouldings
painted
a
whitish
gray
along
the
upper
portion
of
the
walls
and
the
ceiling
with
a
great
deal
of
faded
and
carefully
repaired
tapestry
in
the
doorways
and
a
turkey
carpet
in
light
colors
still
soft
and
deep
in
spite
of
great
antiquity
on
the
floor
and
portraits
of
each
of
madame
de
bellegarde
s
children
at
the
age
of
ten
suspended
against
an
old
screen
of
red
silk
the
room
was
illumined
exactly
enough
for
conversation
by
half
a
dozen
candles
placed
in
odd
corners
at
a
great
distance
apart
in
a
deep
armchair
near
the
fire
sat
an
old
lady
in
black
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
another
person
was
seated
at
the
piano
playing
a
very
expressive
waltz
in
this
latter
person
newman
recognized
the
young
marquise
de
bellegarde
valentin
presented
his
friend
and
newman
walked
up
to
the
old
lady
by
the
fire
and
shook
hands
with
her
he
received
a
rapid
impression
of
a
white
delicate
aged
face
with
a
high
forehead
a
small
mouth
and
a
pair
of
cold
blue
eyes
which
had
kept
much
of
the
freshness
of
youth
madame
de
bellegarde
looked
hard
at
him
and
returned
his
with
a
sort
of
british
positiveness
which
reminded
him
that
she
was
the
daughter
of
the
earl
of
dunstan
s
her
stopped
playing
and
gave
him
an
agreeable
smile
newman
sat
down
and
looked
about
him
while
valentin
went
and
kissed
the
hand
of
the
young
marquise
i
ought
to
have
seen
you
before
said
madame
de
bellegarde
you
have
paid
several
visits
to
my
oh
yes
said
newman
smiling
madame
de
cintré
and
i
are
old
friends
by
this
you
have
gone
fast
said
madame
de
bellegarde
not
so
fast
as
i
should
like
said
newman
bravely
oh
you
are
very
ambitious
answered
the
old
lady
yes
i
confess
i
am
said
newman
smiling
madame
de
bellegarde
looked
at
him
with
her
cold
fine
eyes
and
he
returned
her
gaze
reflecting
that
she
was
a
possible
adversary
and
trying
to
take
her
measure
their
eyes
remained
in
contact
for
some
moments
then
madame
de
bellegarde
looked
away
and
without
smiling
i
am
very
ambitious
too
she
said
newman
felt
that
taking
her
measure
was
not
easy
she
was
a
formidable
inscrutable
little
woman
she
resembled
her
daughter
and
yet
she
was
utterly
unlike
her
the
coloring
in
madame
de
cintré
was
the
same
and
the
high
delicacy
of
her
brow
and
nose
was
hereditary
but
her
face
was
a
larger
and
freer
copy
and
her
mouth
in
especial
a
happy
divergence
from
that
conservative
orifice
a
little
pair
of
lips
at
once
plump
and
pinched
that
looked
when
closed
as
if
they
could
not
open
wider
than
to
swallow
a
gooseberry
or
to
emit
an
oh
dear
no
which
probably
had
been
thought
to
give
the
finishing
touch
to
the
aristocratic
prettiness
of
the
lady
emmeline
atheling
as
represented
forty
years
before
in
several
books
of
beauty
madame
de
cintré
s
face
had
to
newman
s
eye
a
range
of
expression
as
delightfully
vast
as
the
distance
on
a
western
prairie
but
her
mother
s
white
intense
respectable
countenance
with
its
formal
gaze
and
its
circumscribed
smile
suggested
a
document
signed
and
sealed
a
thing
of
parchment
ink
and
ruled
lines
she
is
a
woman
of
conventions
and
proprieties
he
said
to
himself
as
he
looked
at
her
her
world
is
the
world
of
things
immutably
decreed
but
how
she
is
at
home
in
it
and
what
a
paradise
she
finds
it
she
walks
about
in
it
as
if
it
were
a
blooming
park
a
garden
of
eden
and
when
she
sees
this
is
genteel
or
this
is
improper
written
on
a
she
stops
ecstatically
as
if
she
were
listening
to
a
nightingale
or
smelling
a
madame
de
bellegarde
wore
a
little
black
velvet
hood
tied
under
her
chin
and
she
was
wrapped
in
an
old
black
cashmere
shawl
you
are
an
american
she
said
presently
i
have
seen
several
there
are
several
in
paris
said
newman
jocosely
oh
really
said
madame
de
bellegarde
it
was
in
england
i
saw
these
or
somewhere
else
not
in
paris
i
think
it
must
have
been
in
the
pyrenees
many
years
ago
i
am
told
your
ladies
are
very
pretty
one
of
these
ladies
was
very
pretty
such
a
wonderful
complexion
she
presented
me
a
note
of
introduction
from
someone
i
forgot
whom
and
she
sent
with
it
a
note
of
her
own
i
kept
her
letter
a
long
time
afterwards
it
was
so
strangely
expressed
i
used
to
know
some
of
the
phrases
by
heart
but
i
have
forgotten
them
now
it
is
so
many
years
ago
since
then
i
have
seen
no
more
americans
i
think
my
has
she
is
a
great
she
sees
at
this
the
younger
lady
came
rustling
forward
pinching
in
a
very
slender
waist
and
casting
idly
preoccupied
glances
over
the
front
of
her
dress
which
was
apparently
designed
for
a
ball
she
was
in
a
singular
way
at
once
ugly
and
pretty
she
had
protuberant
eyes
and
lips
strangely
red
she
reminded
newman
of
his
friend
mademoiselle
nioche
this
was
what
that
young
lady
would
have
liked
to
be
valentin
de
bellegarde
walked
behind
her
at
a
distance
hopping
about
to
keep
off
the
train
of
her
dress
you
ought
to
show
more
of
your
shoulders
behind
he
said
very
gravely
you
might
as
well
wear
a
standing
ruff
as
such
a
dress
as
the
young
woman
turned
her
back
to
the
mirror
over
the
and
glanced
behind
her
to
verify
valentin
s
assertion
the
mirror
descended
low
and
yet
it
reflected
nothing
but
a
large
unclad
flesh
surface
the
young
marquise
put
her
hands
behind
her
and
gave
a
downward
pull
to
the
waist
of
her
dress
like
that
you
mean
she
asked
that
is
a
little
better
said
bellegarde
in
the
same
tone
but
it
leaves
a
good
deal
to
be
oh
i
never
go
to
extremes
said
his
and
then
turning
to
madame
de
bellegarde
what
were
you
calling
me
just
now
madame
i
called
you
a
said
the
old
lady
but
i
might
call
you
something
else
a
what
an
ugly
word
what
does
it
mean
a
very
beautiful
person
newman
ventured
to
say
seeing
that
it
was
in
french
that
is
a
pretty
compliment
but
a
bad
translation
said
the
young
marquise
and
then
looking
at
him
a
moment
do
you
dance
not
a
you
are
very
wrong
she
said
simply
and
with
another
look
at
her
back
in
the
mirror
she
turned
away
do
you
like
paris
asked
the
old
lady
who
was
apparently
wondering
what
was
the
proper
way
to
talk
to
an
american
yes
rather
said
newman
and
then
he
added
with
a
friendly
intonation
don
t
you
i
can
t
say
i
know
it
i
know
my
house
i
know
my
friends
i
don
t
know
oh
you
lose
a
great
deal
said
newman
sympathetically
madame
de
bellegarde
stared
it
was
presumably
the
first
time
she
had
been
condoled
with
on
her
losses
i
am
content
with
what
i
have
she
said
with
dignity
newman
s
eyes
at
this
moment
were
wandering
round
the
room
which
struck
him
as
rather
sad
and
shabby
passing
from
the
high
casements
with
their
small
panes
to
the
sallow
tints
of
two
or
three
portraits
in
pastel
of
the
last
century
which
hung
between
them
he
ought
obviously
to
have
answered
that
the
contentment
of
his
hostess
was
quite
natural
she
had
a
great
deal
but
the
idea
did
not
occur
to
him
during
the
pause
of
some
moments
which
followed
well
my
dear
mother
said
valentin
coming
and
leaning
against
the
what
do
you
think
of
my
dear
friend
newman
is
he
not
the
excellent
fellow
i
told
you
my
acquaintance
with
newman
has
not
gone
very
far
said
madame
de
bellegarde
i
can
as
yet
only
appreciate
his
great
my
mother
is
a
great
judge
of
these
matters
said
valentin
to
newman
if
you
have
satisfied
her
it
is
a
i
hope
i
shall
satisfy
you
some
day
said
newman
looking
at
the
old
lady
i
have
done
nothing
you
must
not
listen
to
my
son
he
will
bring
you
into
trouble
he
is
a
sad
oh
i
like
him
i
like
him
said
newman
genially
he
amuses
you
eh
yes
do
you
hear
that
valentin
said
madame
de
bellegarde
you
amuse
perhaps
we
shall
all
come
to
that
valentin
exclaimed
you
must
see
my
other
son
said
madame
de
bellegarde
he
is
much
better
than
this
one
but
he
will
not
amuse
i
don
t
know
i
don
t
know
murmured
valentin
reflectively
but
we
shall
very
soon
see
here
comes
mon
the
door
had
just
opened
to
give
ingress
to
a
gentleman
who
stepped
forward
and
whose
face
newman
remembered
he
had
been
the
author
of
our
hero
s
discomfiture
the
first
time
he
tried
to
present
himself
to
madame
de
cintré
valentin
de
bellegarde
went
to
meet
his
brother
looked
at
him
a
moment
and
then
taking
him
by
the
arm
led
him
up
to
newman
this
is
my
excellent
friend
newman
he
said
very
blandly
you
must
know
i
am
delighted
to
know
newman
said
the
marquis
with
a
low
bow
but
without
offering
his
hand
he
is
the
old
woman
at
newman
said
to
himself
as
he
returned
de
bellegarde
s
greeting
and
this
was
the
of
a
speculative
theory
in
his
mind
that
the
late
marquis
had
been
a
very
amiable
foreigner
with
an
inclination
to
take
life
easily
and
a
sense
that
it
was
difficult
for
the
husband
of
the
stilted
little
lady
by
the
fire
to
do
so
but
if
he
had
taken
little
comfort
in
his
wife
he
had
taken
much
in
his
two
younger
children
who
were
after
his
own
heart
while
madame
de
bellegarde
had
paired
with
her
my
brother
has
spoken
to
me
of
you
said
de
bellegarde
and
as
you
are
also
acquainted
with
my
sister
it
was
time
we
should
he
turned
to
his
mother
and
gallantly
bent
over
her
hand
touching
it
with
his
lips
and
then
he
assumed
an
attitude
before
the
with
his
long
lean
face
his
nose
and
his
small
opaque
eye
he
looked
much
like
an
englishman
his
whiskers
were
fair
and
glossy
and
he
had
a
large
dimple
of
unmistakably
british
origin
in
the
middle
of
his
handsome
chin
he
was
distinguished
to
the
tips
of
his
polished
nails
and
there
was
not
a
movement
of
his
fine
perpendicular
person
that
was
not
noble
and
majestic
newman
had
never
yet
been
confronted
with
such
an
incarnation
of
the
art
of
taking
one
s
self
seriously
he
felt
a
sort
of
impulse
to
step
backward
as
you
do
to
get
a
view
of
a
great
façade
urbain
said
young
madame
de
bellegarde
who
had
apparently
been
waiting
for
her
husband
to
take
her
to
her
ball
i
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
i
am
that
is
a
good
idea
murmured
valentin
i
am
at
your
orders
my
dear
friend
said
de
bellegarde
only
you
must
allow
me
first
the
pleasure
of
a
little
conversation
with
oh
if
you
are
going
to
a
party
don
t
let
me
keep
you
objected
newman
i
am
very
sure
we
shall
meet
again
indeed
if
you
would
like
to
converse
with
me
i
will
gladly
name
an
he
was
eager
to
make
it
known
that
he
would
readily
answer
all
questions
and
satisfy
all
exactions
de
bellegarde
stood
in
a
position
before
the
fire
caressing
one
of
his
fair
whiskers
with
one
of
his
white
hands
and
looking
at
newman
half
askance
with
eyes
from
which
a
particular
ray
of
observation
made
its
way
through
a
general
meaningless
smile
it
is
very
kind
of
you
to
make
such
an
offer
he
said
if
i
am
not
mistaken
your
occupations
are
such
as
to
make
your
time
precious
you
are
in
a
as
we
say
les
in
business
you
mean
oh
no
i
have
thrown
business
overboard
for
the
present
i
am
loafing
as
say
my
time
is
quite
my
ah
you
are
taking
a
holiday
rejoined
de
bellegarde
yes
i
have
heard
that
mr
newman
is
american
said
madame
de
bellegarde
my
brother
is
a
great
ethnologist
said
valentin
an
ethnologist
said
newman
ah
you
collect
negroes
skulls
and
that
sort
of
the
marquis
looked
hard
at
his
brother
and
began
to
caress
his
other
whisker
then
turning
to
newman
with
sustained
urbanity
you
are
traveling
for
your
pleasure
he
oh
i
am
knocking
about
to
pick
up
one
thing
and
another
of
course
i
get
a
good
deal
of
pleasure
out
of
what
especially
interests
you
inquired
the
marquis
well
everything
interests
me
said
newman
i
am
not
particular
manufactures
are
what
i
care
most
that
has
been
your
specialty
i
can
t
say
i
have
any
specialty
my
specialty
has
been
to
make
the
largest
possible
fortune
in
the
shortest
possible
newman
made
this
last
remark
very
deliberately
he
wished
to
open
the
way
if
it
were
necessary
to
an
authoritative
statement
of
his
means
de
bellegarde
laughed
agreeably
i
hope
you
have
succeeded
he
said
yes
i
have
made
a
fortune
in
a
reasonable
time
i
am
not
so
old
you
paris
is
a
very
good
place
to
spend
a
fortune
i
wish
you
great
enjoyment
of
and
de
bellegarde
drew
forth
his
gloves
and
began
to
put
them
on
newman
for
a
few
moments
watched
him
sliding
his
white
hands
into
the
white
kid
and
as
he
did
so
his
feelings
took
a
singular
turn
de
bellegarde
s
good
wishes
seemed
to
descend
out
of
the
white
expanse
of
his
sublime
serenity
with
the
soft
scattered
movement
of
a
shower
of
yet
newman
was
not
irritated
he
did
not
feel
that
he
was
being
patronized
he
was
conscious
of
no
especial
impulse
to
introduce
a
discord
into
so
noble
a
harmony
only
he
felt
himself
suddenly
in
personal
contact
with
the
forces
with
which
his
friend
valentin
had
told
him
that
he
would
have
to
contend
and
he
became
sensible
of
their
intensity
he
wished
to
make
some
answering
manifestation
to
stretch
himself
out
at
his
own
length
to
sound
a
note
at
the
uttermost
end
of
scale
it
must
be
added
that
if
this
impulse
was
not
vicious
or
malicious
it
was
by
no
means
void
of
humorous
expectancy
newman
was
quite
as
ready
to
give
play
to
that
smile
of
his
if
his
hosts
should
happen
to
be
shocked
as
he
was
far
from
deliberately
planning
to
shock
them
paris
is
a
very
good
place
for
idle
people
he
said
or
it
is
a
very
good
place
if
your
family
has
been
settled
here
for
a
long
time
and
you
have
made
acquaintances
and
got
your
relations
round
you
or
if
you
have
got
a
good
big
house
like
this
and
a
wife
and
children
and
mother
and
sister
and
everything
comfortable
i
don
t
like
that
way
of
living
all
in
rooms
next
door
to
each
other
but
i
am
not
an
idler
i
try
to
be
but
i
can
t
manage
it
it
goes
against
the
grain
my
business
habits
are
too
then
i
haven
t
any
house
to
call
my
own
or
anything
in
the
way
of
a
family
my
sisters
are
five
thousand
miles
away
my
mother
died
when
i
was
a
youngster
and
i
haven
t
any
wife
i
wish
i
had
so
you
see
i
don
t
exactly
know
what
to
do
with
myself
i
am
not
fond
of
books
as
you
are
sir
and
i
get
tired
of
dining
out
and
going
to
the
opera
i
miss
my
business
activity
you
see
i
began
to
earn
my
living
when
i
was
almost
a
baby
and
until
a
few
months
ago
i
have
never
had
my
hand
off
the
plow
elegant
leisure
comes
this
speech
was
followed
by
a
profound
silence
of
some
moments
on
the
part
of
newman
s
entertainers
valentin
stood
looking
at
him
fixedly
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
then
he
slowly
with
a
motion
went
out
of
the
door
the
marquis
continued
to
draw
on
his
gloves
and
to
smile
benignantly
you
began
to
earn
your
living
when
you
were
a
mere
baby
said
the
marquise
hardly
more
a
small
you
say
you
are
not
fond
of
books
said
de
bellegarde
but
you
must
do
yourself
the
justice
to
remember
that
your
studies
were
interrupted
that
is
very
true
on
my
tenth
birthday
i
stopped
going
to
school
i
thought
it
was
a
grand
way
to
keep
it
but
i
picked
up
some
information
afterwards
said
newman
reassuringly
you
have
some
sisters
asked
old
madame
de
bellegarde
yes
two
sisters
splendid
women
i
hope
that
for
them
the
hardships
of
life
commenced
less
they
married
very
early
if
you
call
that
a
hardship
as
girls
do
in
our
western
country
one
of
them
is
married
to
the
owner
of
the
largest
house
in
the
ah
you
make
houses
also
of
inquired
the
marquise
you
can
stretch
them
as
your
family
increases
said
young
madame
de
bellegarde
who
was
muffling
herself
in
a
long
white
shawl
newman
indulged
in
a
burst
of
hilarity
and
explained
that
the
house
in
which
his
lived
was
a
large
wooden
structure
but
that
he
manufactured
and
sold
on
a
colossal
scale
my
children
have
some
little
shoes
which
they
put
on
when
they
go
to
play
in
the
tuileries
in
damp
weather
said
the
young
marquise
i
wonder
whether
your
made
very
likely
said
newman
if
he
did
you
may
be
very
sure
they
are
well
well
you
must
not
be
discouraged
said
de
bellegarde
with
vague
urbanity
oh
i
don
t
mean
to
be
i
have
a
project
which
gives
me
plenty
to
think
about
and
that
is
an
and
then
newman
was
silent
a
moment
hesitating
yet
thinking
rapidly
he
wished
to
make
his
point
and
yet
to
do
so
forced
him
to
speak
out
in
a
way
that
was
disagreeable
to
him
nevertheless
he
continued
addressing
himself
to
old
madame
de
bellegarde
i
will
tell
you
my
project
perhaps
you
can
help
me
i
want
to
take
a
it
is
a
very
good
project
but
i
am
no
matchmaker
said
the
old
lady
newman
looked
at
her
an
instant
and
then
with
perfect
sincerity
i
should
have
thought
you
were
he
declared
madame
de
bellegarde
appeared
to
think
him
too
sincere
she
murmured
something
sharply
in
french
and
fixed
her
eyes
on
her
son
at
this
moment
the
door
of
the
room
was
thrown
open
and
with
a
rapid
step
valentin
reappeared
i
have
a
message
for
you
he
said
to
his
claire
bids
me
to
request
you
not
to
start
for
your
ball
she
will
go
with
claire
will
go
with
us
cried
the
young
marquise
voilà
du
nouveau
she
has
changed
her
mind
she
decided
half
an
hour
ago
and
she
is
sticking
the
last
diamond
into
her
hair
said
valentin
what
has
taken
possession
of
my
daughter
demanded
madame
de
bellegarde
sternly
she
has
not
been
into
the
world
these
three
years
does
she
take
such
a
step
at
half
an
hour
s
notice
and
without
consulting
me
she
consulted
me
dear
mother
five
minutes
since
said
valentin
and
i
told
her
that
such
a
beautiful
woman
she
is
beautiful
you
will
see
had
no
right
to
bury
herself
you
should
have
referred
claire
to
her
mother
my
brother
said
de
bellegarde
in
french
this
is
very
i
refer
her
to
the
whole
company
said
valentin
here
she
comes
and
he
went
to
the
open
door
met
madame
de
cintré
on
the
threshold
took
her
by
the
hand
and
led
her
into
the
room
she
was
dressed
in
white
but
a
long
blue
cloak
which
hung
almost
to
her
feet
was
fastened
across
her
shoulders
by
a
silver
clasp
she
had
tossed
it
back
however
and
her
long
white
arms
were
uncovered
in
her
dense
fair
hair
there
glittered
a
dozen
diamonds
she
looked
serious
and
newman
thought
rather
pale
but
she
glanced
round
her
and
when
she
saw
him
smiled
and
put
out
her
hand
he
thought
her
tremendously
handsome
he
had
a
chance
to
look
at
her
full
in
the
face
for
she
stood
a
moment
in
the
centre
of
the
room
hesitating
apparently
what
she
should
do
without
meeting
his
eyes
then
she
went
up
to
her
mother
who
sat
in
her
deep
chair
by
the
fire
looking
at
madame
de
cintré
almost
fiercely
with
her
back
turned
to
the
others
madame
de
cintré
held
her
cloak
apart
to
show
her
dress
what
do
you
think
of
me
she
asked
i
think
you
are
audacious
said
the
marquise
it
was
but
three
days
ago
when
i
asked
you
as
a
particular
favor
to
myself
to
go
to
the
duchess
de
lusignan
s
that
you
told
me
you
were
going
nowhere
and
that
one
must
be
consistent
is
this
your
consistency
why
should
you
distinguish
madame
robineau
who
is
it
you
wish
to
please
i
wish
to
please
myself
dear
mother
said
madame
de
cintré
and
she
bent
over
and
kissed
the
old
lady
i
don
t
like
surprises
my
sister
said
urbain
de
bellegarde
especially
when
one
is
on
the
point
of
entering
a
newman
at
this
juncture
felt
inspired
to
speak
oh
if
you
are
going
into
a
room
with
madame
de
cintré
you
needn
t
be
afraid
of
being
noticed
yourself
de
bellegarde
turned
to
his
sister
with
a
smile
too
intense
to
be
easy
i
hope
you
appreciate
a
compliment
that
is
paid
you
at
your
brother
s
expense
he
said
come
come
and
offering
madame
de
cintré
his
arm
he
led
her
rapidly
out
of
the
room
valentin
rendered
the
same
service
to
young
madame
de
bellegarde
who
had
apparently
been
reflecting
on
the
fact
that
the
of
her
was
much
less
brilliant
than
her
own
and
yet
had
failed
to
derive
absolute
comfort
from
the
reflection
with
a
farewell
smile
she
sought
the
complement
of
her
consolation
in
the
eyes
of
the
american
visitor
and
perceiving
in
them
a
certain
mysterious
brilliancy
it
is
not
improbable
that
she
may
have
flattered
herself
she
had
found
it
newman
left
alone
with
old
madame
de
bellegarde
stood
before
her
a
few
moments
in
silence
your
daughter
is
very
beautiful
he
said
at
last
she
is
very
strange
said
madame
de
bellegarde
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
newman
rejoined
smiling
it
makes
me
hope
what
that
she
will
consent
some
day
to
marry
the
old
lady
slowly
rose
to
her
feet
that
really
is
your
project
then
yes
will
you
favor
it
favor
it
madame
de
bellegarde
looked
at
him
a
moment
and
then
shook
her
head
no
she
said
softly
will
you
suffer
it
then
will
you
let
it
pass
you
don
t
know
what
you
ask
i
am
a
very
proud
and
meddlesome
old
well
i
am
very
rich
said
newman
madame
de
bellegarde
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
floor
and
newman
thought
it
probable
she
was
weighing
the
reasons
in
favor
of
resenting
the
brutality
of
this
remark
but
at
last
looking
up
she
said
simply
how
rich
newman
expressed
his
income
in
a
round
number
which
had
the
magnificent
sound
that
large
aggregations
of
dollars
put
on
when
they
are
translated
into
francs
he
added
a
few
remarks
of
a
financial
character
which
completed
a
sufficiently
striking
presentment
of
his
resources
madame
de
bellegarde
listened
in
silence
you
are
very
frank
she
said
finally
i
will
be
the
same
i
would
rather
favor
you
on
the
whole
than
suffer
you
it
will
be
i
am
thankful
for
any
terms
said
newman
but
for
the
present
you
have
suffered
me
long
enough
good
night
and
he
took
his
leave
chapter
xi
newman
on
his
return
to
paris
had
not
resumed
the
study
of
french
conversation
with
nioche
he
found
that
he
had
too
many
other
uses
for
his
time
nioche
however
came
to
see
him
very
promptly
having
learned
his
whereabouts
by
a
mysterious
process
to
which
his
patron
never
obtained
the
key
the
shrunken
little
capitalist
repeated
his
visit
more
than
once
he
seemed
oppressed
by
a
humiliating
sense
of
having
been
overpaid
and
wished
apparently
to
redeem
his
debt
by
the
offer
of
grammatical
and
statistical
information
in
small
installments
he
wore
the
same
decently
melancholy
aspect
as
a
few
months
before
a
few
months
more
or
less
of
brushing
could
make
little
difference
in
the
antique
lustre
of
his
coat
and
hat
but
the
poor
old
man
s
spirit
was
a
trifle
more
threadbare
it
seemed
to
have
received
some
hard
rubs
during
the
summer
newman
inquired
with
interest
about
mademoiselle
noémie
and
nioche
at
first
for
answer
simply
looked
at
him
in
lachrymose
silence
don
t
ask
me
sir
he
said
at
last
i
sit
and
watch
her
but
i
can
do
do
you
mean
that
she
misconducts
herself
i
don
t
know
i
am
sure
i
can
t
follow
her
i
don
t
understand
her
she
has
something
in
her
head
i
don
t
know
what
she
is
trying
to
do
she
is
too
deep
for
does
she
continue
to
go
to
the
louvre
has
she
made
any
of
those
copies
for
me
she
goes
to
the
louvre
but
i
see
nothing
of
the
copies
she
has
something
on
her
easel
i
suppose
it
is
one
of
the
pictures
you
ordered
such
a
magnificent
order
ought
to
give
her
but
she
is
not
in
earnest
i
can
t
say
anything
to
her
i
am
afraid
of
her
one
evening
last
summer
when
i
took
her
to
walk
in
the
champs
élysées
she
said
some
things
to
me
that
frightened
what
were
they
excuse
an
unhappy
father
from
telling
you
said
nioche
unfolding
his
calico
newman
promised
himself
to
pay
mademoiselle
noémie
another
visit
at
the
louvre
he
was
curious
about
the
progress
of
his
copies
but
it
must
be
added
that
he
was
still
more
curious
about
the
progress
of
the
young
lady
herself
he
went
one
afternoon
to
the
great
museum
and
wandered
through
several
of
the
rooms
in
fruitless
quest
of
her
he
was
bending
his
steps
to
the
long
hall
of
the
italian
masters
when
suddenly
he
found
himself
face
to
face
with
valentin
de
bellegarde
the
young
frenchman
greeted
him
with
ardor
and
assured
him
that
he
was
a
godsend
he
himself
was
in
the
worst
of
humors
and
he
wanted
someone
to
contradict
in
a
bad
humor
among
all
these
beautiful
things
said
newman
i
thought
you
were
so
fond
of
pictures
especially
the
old
black
ones
there
are
two
or
three
here
that
ought
to
keep
you
in
oh
answered
valentin
i
am
not
in
a
mood
for
pictures
and
the
more
beautiful
they
are
the
less
i
like
them
their
great
staring
eyes
and
fixed
positions
irritate
me
i
feel
as
if
i
were
at
some
big
dull
party
in
a
room
full
of
people
i
shouldn
t
wish
to
speak
to
what
should
i
care
for
their
beauty
it
s
a
bore
and
worse
still
it
s
a
reproach
i
have
a
great
many
i
feel
if
the
louvre
has
so
little
comfort
for
you
why
in
the
world
did
you
come
here
newman
asked
that
is
one
of
my
i
came
to
meet
my
cousin
a
dreadful
english
cousin
a
member
of
my
mother
s
family
who
is
in
paris
for
a
week
for
her
husband
and
who
wishes
me
to
point
out
the
principal
imagine
a
woman
who
wears
a
green
crape
bonnet
in
december
and
has
straps
sticking
out
of
the
ankles
of
her
interminable
boots
my
mother
begged
i
would
do
something
to
oblige
them
i
have
undertaken
to
play
de
this
afternoon
they
were
to
have
met
me
here
at
two
o
clock
and
i
have
been
waiting
for
them
twenty
minutes
why
doesn
t
she
arrive
she
has
at
least
a
pair
of
feet
to
carry
her
i
don
t
know
whether
to
be
furious
at
their
playing
me
false
or
delighted
to
have
escaped
i
think
in
your
place
i
would
be
furious
said
newman
because
they
may
arrive
yet
and
then
your
fury
will
still
be
of
use
to
you
whereas
if
you
were
delighted
and
they
were
afterwards
to
turn
up
you
might
not
know
what
to
do
with
your
you
give
me
excellent
advice
and
i
already
feel
better
i
will
be
furious
i
will
let
them
go
to
the
deuce
and
i
myself
will
go
with
you
unless
by
chance
you
too
have
a
it
is
not
exactly
a
rendezvous
said
newman
but
i
have
in
fact
come
to
see
a
person
not
a
a
woman
presumably
a
young
well
said
valentin
i
hope
for
you
with
all
my
heart
that
she
is
not
clothed
in
green
tulle
and
that
her
feet
are
not
too
much
out
of
i
don
t
know
much
about
her
feet
but
she
has
very
pretty
valentin
gave
a
sigh
and
on
that
assurance
i
must
part
with
you
i
am
not
certain
of
finding
my
young
lady
said
newman
and
i
am
not
quite
prepared
to
lose
your
company
on
the
chance
it
does
not
strike
me
as
particularly
desirable
to
introduce
you
to
her
and
yet
i
should
rather
like
to
have
your
opinion
of
is
she
pretty
i
guess
you
will
think
bellegarde
passed
his
arm
into
that
of
his
companion
conduct
me
to
her
on
the
instant
i
should
be
ashamed
to
make
a
pretty
woman
wait
for
my
newman
suffered
himself
to
be
gently
propelled
in
the
direction
in
which
he
had
been
walking
but
his
step
was
not
rapid
he
was
turning
something
over
in
his
mind
the
two
men
passed
into
the
long
gallery
of
the
italian
masters
and
newman
after
having
scanned
for
a
moment
its
brilliant
vista
turned
aside
into
the
smaller
apartment
devoted
to
the
same
school
on
the
left
it
contained
very
few
persons
but
at
the
farther
end
of
it
sat
mademoiselle
nioche
before
her
easel
she
was
not
at
work
her
palette
and
brushes
had
been
laid
down
beside
her
her
hands
were
folded
in
her
lap
and
she
was
leaning
back
in
her
chair
and
looking
intently
at
two
ladies
on
the
other
side
of
the
hall
who
with
their
backs
turned
to
her
had
stopped
before
one
of
the
pictures
these
ladies
were
apparently
persons
of
high
fashion
they
were
dressed
with
great
splendor
and
their
long
silken
trains
and
furbelows
were
spread
over
the
polished
floor
it
was
at
their
dresses
mademoiselle
noémie
was
looking
though
what
she
was
thinking
of
i
am
unable
to
say
i
hazard
the
supposition
that
she
was
saying
to
herself
that
to
be
able
to
drag
such
a
train
over
a
polished
floor
was
a
felicity
worth
any
price
her
reflections
at
any
rate
were
disturbed
by
the
advent
of
newman
and
his
companion
she
glanced
at
them
quickly
and
then
coloring
a
little
rose
and
stood
before
her
easel
i
came
here
on
purpose
to
see
you
said
newman
in
his
bad
french
offering
to
shake
hands
and
then
like
a
good
american
he
introduced
valentin
formally
allow
me
to
make
you
acquainted
with
the
comte
valentin
de
valentin
made
a
bow
which
must
have
seemed
to
mademoiselle
noémie
quite
in
harmony
with
the
impressiveness
of
his
title
but
the
graceful
brevity
of
her
own
response
made
no
concession
to
underbred
surprise
she
turned
to
newman
putting
up
her
hands
to
her
hair
and
smoothing
its
roughness
then
rapidly
she
turned
the
canvas
that
was
on
her
easel
over
upon
its
face
you
have
not
forgotten
me
she
asked
i
shall
never
forget
you
said
newman
you
may
be
sure
of
oh
said
the
young
girl
there
are
a
great
many
different
ways
of
remembering
a
and
she
looked
straight
at
valentin
de
bellegarde
who
was
looking
at
her
as
a
gentleman
may
when
a
verdict
is
expected
of
him
have
you
painted
anything
for
me
said
newman
have
you
been
industrious
no
i
have
done
and
taking
up
her
palette
she
began
to
mix
her
colors
at
hazard
but
your
father
tells
me
you
have
come
here
i
have
nowhere
else
to
go
here
all
summer
it
was
cool
at
being
here
then
said
newman
you
might
have
tried
i
told
you
before
she
answered
softly
that
i
don
t
know
how
to
but
you
have
something
charming
on
your
easel
now
said
valentin
if
you
would
only
let
me
see
she
spread
out
her
two
hands
with
the
fingers
expanded
over
the
back
of
the
canvas
those
hands
which
newman
had
called
pretty
and
which
in
spite
of
several
valentin
could
now
admire
my
painting
is
not
charming
she
said
it
is
the
only
thing
about
you
that
is
not
then
mademoiselle
quoth
valentin
gallantly
she
took
up
her
little
canvas
and
silently
passed
it
to
him
he
looked
at
it
and
in
a
moment
she
said
i
am
sure
you
are
a
yes
he
answered
i
you
know
then
that
that
is
very
said
valentin
shrugging
his
shoulders
let
us
you
know
that
i
ought
not
to
attempt
to
paint
the
young
girl
continued
frankly
then
mademoiselle
i
think
you
ought
she
began
to
look
at
the
dresses
of
the
two
splendid
ladies
again
a
point
on
which
having
risked
one
conjecture
i
think
i
may
risk
another
while
she
was
looking
at
the
ladies
she
was
seeing
valentin
de
bellegarde
he
at
all
events
was
seeing
her
he
put
down
the
canvas
and
addressed
a
little
click
with
his
tongue
accompanied
by
an
elevation
of
the
eyebrows
to
newman
where
have
you
been
all
these
months
asked
mademoiselle
noémie
of
our
hero
you
took
those
great
journeys
you
amused
yourself
well
oh
yes
said
newman
i
amused
myself
well
i
am
very
glad
said
mademoiselle
noémie
with
extreme
gentleness
and
she
began
to
dabble
in
her
colors
again
she
was
singularly
pretty
with
the
look
of
serious
sympathy
that
she
threw
into
her
face
valentin
took
advantage
of
her
downcast
eyes
to
telegraph
again
to
his
companion
he
renewed
his
mysterious
physiognomical
play
making
at
the
same
time
a
rapid
tremulous
movement
in
the
air
with
his
fingers
he
was
evidently
finding
mademoiselle
noémie
extremely
interesting
the
blue
devils
had
departed
leaving
the
field
clear
tell
me
something
about
your
travels
murmured
the
young
girl
oh
i
went
to
switzerland
to
geneva
and
zermatt
and
zürich
and
all
those
places
you
know
and
down
to
venice
and
all
through
germany
and
down
the
rhine
and
into
holland
and
belgium
the
regular
round
how
do
you
say
that
in
french
the
regular
round
newman
asked
of
valentin
mademoiselle
nioche
fixed
her
eyes
an
instant
on
bellegarde
and
then
with
a
little
smile
i
don
t
understand
monsieur
she
said
when
he
says
so
much
at
once
would
you
be
so
good
as
to
translate
i
would
rather
talk
to
you
out
of
my
own
head
valentin
declared
no
said
newman
gravely
still
in
his
bad
french
you
must
not
talk
to
mademoiselle
nioche
because
you
say
discouraging
things
you
ought
to
tell
her
to
work
to
and
we
french
mademoiselle
said
valentin
are
accused
of
being
false
flatterers
i
don
t
want
any
flattery
i
want
only
the
truth
but
i
know
the
all
i
say
is
that
i
suspect
there
are
some
things
that
you
can
do
better
than
paint
said
valentin
i
know
the
truth
i
know
the
truth
mademoiselle
noémie
repeated
and
dipping
a
brush
into
a
clot
of
red
paint
she
drew
a
great
horizontal
daub
across
her
unfinished
picture
what
is
that
asked
newman
without
answering
she
drew
another
long
crimson
daub
in
a
vertical
direction
down
the
middle
of
her
canvas
and
so
in
a
moment
completed
the
rough
indication
of
a
cross
it
is
the
sign
of
the
truth
she
said
at
last
the
two
men
looked
at
each
other
and
valentin
indulged
in
another
flash
of
physiognomical
eloquence
you
have
spoiled
your
picture
said
newman
i
know
that
very
well
it
was
the
only
thing
to
do
with
it
i
had
sat
looking
at
it
all
day
without
touching
it
i
had
begun
to
hate
it
it
seemed
to
me
something
was
going
to
i
like
it
better
that
way
than
as
it
was
before
said
valentin
now
it
is
more
interesting
it
tells
a
story
is
it
for
sale
everything
i
have
is
for
sale
said
mademoiselle
noémie
how
much
is
this
thing
ten
thousand
francs
said
the
young
girl
without
a
smile
everything
that
mademoiselle
nioche
may
do
at
present
is
mine
in
advance
said
newman
it
makes
part
of
an
order
i
gave
her
some
months
ago
so
you
can
t
have
monsieur
will
lose
nothing
by
it
said
the
young
girl
looking
at
valentin
and
she
began
to
put
up
her
utensils
i
shall
have
gained
a
charming
memory
said
valentin
you
are
going
away
your
day
is
over
my
father
is
coming
to
fetch
me
said
mademoiselle
noémie
she
had
hardly
spoken
when
through
the
door
behind
her
which
opens
on
one
of
the
great
white
stone
staircases
of
the
louvre
nioche
made
his
appearance
he
came
in
with
his
usual
even
patient
shuffle
and
he
made
a
low
salute
to
the
two
gentlemen
who
were
standing
before
his
daughter
s
easel
newman
shook
his
hands
with
muscular
friendliness
and
valentin
returned
his
greeting
with
extreme
deference
while
the
old
man
stood
waiting
for
noémie
to
make
a
parcel
of
her
implements
he
let
his
mild
oblique
gaze
hover
toward
bellegarde
who
was
watching
mademoiselle
noémie
put
on
her
bonnet
and
mantle
valentin
was
at
no
pains
to
disguise
his
scrutiny
he
looked
at
a
pretty
girl
as
he
would
have
listened
to
a
piece
of
music
attention
in
each
case
was
simple
good
manners
nioche
at
last
took
his
daughter
s
in
one
hand
and
the
bedaubed
canvas
after
giving
it
a
solemn
puzzled
stare
in
the
other
and
led
the
way
to
the
door
mademoiselle
noémie
made
the
young
men
the
salute
of
a
duchess
and
followed
her
father
well
said
newman
what
do
you
think
of
her
she
is
very
remarkable
diable
diable
repeated
de
bellegarde
reflectively
she
is
very
i
am
afraid
she
is
a
sad
little
adventuress
said
newman
not
a
little
one
a
great
one
she
has
the
and
valentin
began
to
walk
away
slowly
looking
vaguely
at
the
pictures
on
the
walls
with
a
thoughtful
illumination
in
his
eye
nothing
could
have
appealed
to
his
imagination
more
than
the
possible
adventures
of
a
young
lady
endowed
with
the
material
of
mademoiselle
nioche
she
is
very
interesting
he
went
on
she
is
a
beautiful
a
beautiful
type
what
the
deuce
do
you
mean
asked
newman
i
mean
from
the
artistic
point
of
view
she
is
an
artist
outside
of
her
painting
which
obviously
is
but
she
is
not
beautiful
i
don
t
even
think
her
very
she
is
quite
pretty
enough
for
her
purposes
and
it
is
a
face
and
figure
on
which
everything
tells
if
she
were
prettier
she
would
be
less
intelligent
and
her
intelligence
is
half
of
her
in
what
way
asked
newman
who
was
much
amused
at
his
companion
s
immediate
philosophisation
of
mademoiselle
nioche
does
her
intelligence
strike
you
as
so
remarkable
she
has
taken
the
measure
of
life
and
she
has
determined
to
something
to
succeed
at
any
cost
her
painting
of
course
is
a
mere
trick
to
gain
time
she
is
waiting
for
her
chance
she
wishes
to
launch
herself
and
to
do
it
well
she
knows
her
paris
she
is
one
of
fifty
thousand
so
far
as
the
mere
ambition
goes
but
i
am
very
sure
that
in
the
way
of
resolution
and
capacity
she
is
a
rarity
and
in
one
gift
perfect
heartlessness
i
will
warrant
she
is
unsurpassed
she
has
not
as
much
heart
as
will
go
on
the
point
of
a
needle
that
is
an
immense
virtue
yes
she
is
one
of
the
celebrities
of
the
heaven
help
us
said
newman
how
far
the
artistic
point
of
view
may
take
a
man
but
in
this
case
i
must
request
that
you
don
t
let
it
take
you
too
far
you
have
learned
a
wonderful
deal
about
mademoiselle
noémie
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
let
that
suffice
don
t
follow
up
your
my
dear
fellow
cried
bellegarde
with
warmth
i
hope
i
have
too
good
manners
to
you
are
not
intruding
the
girl
is
nothing
to
me
in
fact
i
rather
dislike
her
but
i
like
her
poor
old
father
and
for
his
sake
i
beg
you
to
abstain
from
any
attempt
to
verify
your
for
the
sake
of
that
seedy
old
gentleman
who
came
to
fetch
her
demanded
valentin
stopping
short
and
on
newman
s
assenting
ah
no
ah
no
he
went
on
with
a
smile
you
are
quite
wrong
my
dear
fellow
you
needn
t
mind
i
verily
believe
that
you
are
accusing
the
poor
gentleman
of
being
capable
of
rejoicing
in
his
daughter
s
said
valentin
who
is
he
what
is
he
he
is
what
he
looks
like
as
poor
as
a
rat
but
very
exactly
i
noticed
him
perfectly
be
sure
i
do
him
justice
he
has
had
losses
as
we
say
he
is
very
and
his
daughter
is
too
much
for
him
he
is
the
pink
of
respectability
and
he
has
sixty
years
of
honesty
on
his
back
all
this
i
perfectly
appreciate
but
i
know
my
and
my
and
i
will
make
a
bargain
with
newman
gave
ear
to
his
bargain
and
he
went
on
he
would
rather
his
daughter
were
a
good
girl
than
a
bad
one
but
if
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
the
old
man
will
not
do
what
virginius
did
success
justifies
everything
if
mademoiselle
noémie
makes
a
figure
her
papa
will
feel
well
we
will
call
it
relieved
and
she
will
make
a
figure
the
old
gentleman
s
future
is
i
don
t
know
what
virginius
did
but
nioche
will
shoot
miss
noémie
said
newman
after
that
i
suppose
his
future
will
be
assured
in
some
snug
i
am
not
a
cynic
i
am
simply
an
observer
valentin
rejoined
mademoiselle
noémie
interests
me
she
is
extremely
remarkable
if
there
is
a
good
reason
in
honor
or
decency
for
dismissing
her
from
my
thoughts
forever
i
am
perfectly
willing
to
do
it
your
estimate
of
the
papa
s
sensibilities
is
a
good
reason
until
it
is
invalidated
i
promise
you
not
to
look
at
the
young
girl
again
until
you
tell
me
that
you
have
changed
your
mind
about
the
papa
when
he
has
given
distinct
proof
of
being
a
philosopher
you
will
raise
your
interdict
do
you
agree
to
that
do
you
mean
to
bribe
him
oh
you
admit
then
that
he
is
bribable
no
he
would
ask
too
much
and
it
would
not
be
exactly
fair
i
mean
simply
to
wait
you
will
continue
i
suppose
to
see
this
interesting
couple
and
you
will
give
me
the
news
well
said
newman
if
the
old
man
turns
out
a
humbug
you
may
do
what
you
please
i
wash
my
hands
of
the
matter
for
the
girl
herself
you
may
be
at
rest
i
don
t
know
what
harm
she
may
do
to
me
but
i
certainly
can
t
hurt
her
it
seems
to
me
said
newman
that
you
are
very
well
matched
you
are
both
hard
cases
and
nioche
and
i
i
believe
are
the
only
virtuous
men
to
be
found
in
soon
after
this
de
bellegarde
in
punishment
for
his
levity
received
a
stern
poke
in
the
back
from
a
pointed
instrument
turning
quickly
round
he
found
the
weapon
to
be
a
parasol
wielded
by
a
lady
in
green
gauze
bonnet
valentin
s
english
cousins
had
been
drifting
about
unpiloted
and
evidently
deemed
that
they
had
a
grievance
newman
left
him
to
their
mercies
but
with
a
boundless
faith
in
his
power
to
plead
his
cause
chapter
xii
three
days
after
his
introduction
to
the
family
of
madame
de
cintré
newman
coming
in
toward
evening
found
upon
his
table
the
card
of
the
marquis
de
bellegarde
on
the
following
day
he
received
a
note
informing
him
that
the
marquise
de
bellegarde
would
be
grateful
for
the
honor
of
his
company
at
dinner
he
went
of
course
though
he
had
to
break
another
engagement
to
do
it
he
was
ushered
into
the
room
in
which
madame
de
bellegarde
had
received
him
before
and
here
he
found
his
venerable
hostess
surrounded
by
her
entire
family
the
room
was
lighted
only
by
the
crackling
fire
which
illuminated
the
very
small
pink
slippers
of
a
lady
who
seated
in
a
low
chair
was
stretching
out
her
toes
before
it
this
lady
was
the
younger
madame
de
bellegarde
madame
de
cintré
was
seated
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
holding
a
little
girl
against
her
knee
the
child
of
her
brother
urbain
to
whom
she
was
apparently
relating
a
wonderful
story
valentin
was
sitting
on
a
puff
close
to
his
into
whose
ear
he
was
certainly
distilling
the
finest
nonsense
the
marquis
was
stationed
before
the
fire
with
his
head
erect
and
his
hands
behind
him
in
an
attitude
of
formal
expectancy
old
madame
de
bellegarde
stood
up
to
give
newman
her
greeting
and
there
was
that
in
the
way
she
did
so
which
seemed
to
measure
narrowly
the
extent
of
her
condescension
we
are
all
alone
you
see
we
have
asked
no
one
else
she
said
austerely
i
am
very
glad
you
didn
t
this
is
much
more
sociable
said
newman
good
evening
sir
and
he
offered
his
hand
to
the
marquis
de
bellegarde
was
affable
but
in
spite
of
his
dignity
he
was
restless
he
began
to
pace
up
and
down
the
room
he
looked
out
of
the
long
windows
he
took
up
books
and
laid
them
down
again
young
madame
de
bellegarde
gave
newman
her
hand
without
moving
and
without
looking
at
him
you
may
think
that
is
coldness
exclaimed
valentin
but
it
is
not
it
is
warmth
it
shows
she
is
treating
you
as
an
intimate
now
she
detests
me
and
yet
she
is
always
looking
at
no
wonder
i
detest
you
if
i
am
always
looking
at
you
cried
the
lady
if
newman
does
not
like
my
way
of
shaking
hands
i
will
do
it
but
this
charming
privilege
was
lost
upon
our
hero
who
was
already
making
his
way
across
the
room
to
madame
de
cintré
she
looked
at
him
as
she
shook
hands
but
she
went
on
with
the
story
she
was
telling
her
little
niece
she
had
only
two
or
three
phrases
to
add
but
they
were
apparently
of
great
moment
she
deepened
her
voice
smiling
as
she
did
so
and
the
little
girl
gazed
at
her
with
round
eyes
but
in
the
end
the
young
prince
married
the
beautiful
florabella
said
madame
de
cintré
and
carried
her
off
to
live
with
him
in
the
land
of
the
pink
sky
there
she
was
so
happy
that
she
forgot
all
her
troubles
and
went
out
to
drive
every
day
of
her
life
in
an
ivory
coach
drawn
by
five
hundred
white
mice
poor
florabella
she
exclaimed
to
newman
had
suffered
she
had
had
nothing
to
eat
for
six
months
said
little
blanche
yes
but
when
the
six
months
were
over
she
had
a
as
big
as
that
ottoman
said
madame
de
cintré
that
quite
set
her
up
what
a
checkered
career
said
newman
are
you
very
fond
of
children
he
was
certain
that
she
was
but
he
wished
to
make
her
say
it
i
like
to
talk
with
them
she
answered
we
can
talk
with
them
so
much
more
seriously
than
with
grown
persons
that
is
great
nonsense
that
i
have
been
telling
blanche
but
it
is
a
great
deal
more
serious
than
most
of
what
we
say
in
i
wish
you
would
talk
to
me
then
as
if
i
were
blanche
s
age
said
newman
laughing
were
you
happy
at
your
ball
the
other
night
ecstatically
now
you
are
talking
the
nonsense
that
we
talk
in
society
said
newman
i
don
t
believe
it
was
my
own
fault
if
i
was
not
happy
the
ball
was
very
pretty
and
everyone
very
it
was
on
your
conscience
said
newman
that
you
had
annoyed
your
mother
and
your
madame
de
cintré
looked
at
him
a
moment
without
answering
that
is
true
she
replied
at
last
i
had
undertaken
more
than
i
could
carry
out
i
have
very
little
courage
i
am
not
a
she
said
this
with
a
certain
soft
emphasis
but
then
changing
her
tone
i
could
never
have
gone
through
the
sufferings
of
the
beautiful
florabella
she
added
not
even
for
her
prospective
rewards
dinner
was
announced
and
newman
betook
himself
to
the
side
of
the
old
madame
de
bellegarde
the
at
the
end
of
a
cold
corridor
was
vast
and
sombre
the
dinner
was
simple
and
delicately
excellent
newman
wondered
whether
madame
de
cintré
had
had
something
to
do
with
ordering
the
repast
and
greatly
hoped
she
had
once
seated
at
table
with
the
various
members
of
the
ancient
house
of
bellegarde
around
him
he
asked
himself
the
meaning
of
his
position
was
the
old
lady
responding
to
his
advances
did
the
fact
that
he
was
a
solitary
guest
augment
his
credit
or
diminish
it
were
they
ashamed
to
show
him
to
other
people
or
did
they
wish
to
give
him
a
sign
of
sudden
adoption
into
their
last
reserve
of
favor
newman
was
on
his
guard
he
was
watchful
and
conjectural
and
yet
at
the
same
time
he
was
vaguely
indifferent
whether
they
gave
him
a
long
rope
or
a
short
one
he
was
there
now
and
madame
de
cintré
was
opposite
to
him
she
had
a
tall
candlestick
on
each
side
of
her
she
would
sit
there
for
the
next
hour
and
that
was
enough
the
dinner
was
extremely
solemn
and
measured
he
wondered
whether
this
was
always
the
state
of
things
in
old
madame
de
bellegarde
held
her
head
very
high
and
fixed
her
eyes
which
looked
peculiarly
sharp
in
her
little
white
face
very
intently
upon
the
the
marquis
appeared
to
have
decided
that
the
fine
arts
offered
a
safe
subject
of
conversation
as
not
leading
to
startling
personal
revelations
every
now
and
then
having
learned
from
newman
that
he
had
been
through
the
museums
of
europe
he
uttered
some
polished
aphorism
upon
the
of
rubens
and
the
good
taste
of
sansovino
his
manners
seemed
to
indicate
a
fine
nervous
dread
that
something
disagreeable
might
happen
if
the
atmosphere
were
not
purified
by
allusions
of
a
thoroughly
superior
cast
what
under
the
sun
is
the
man
afraid
of
newman
asked
himself
does
he
think
i
am
going
to
offer
to
swap
with
him
it
was
useless
to
shut
his
eyes
to
the
fact
that
the
marquis
was
profoundly
disagreeable
to
him
he
had
never
been
a
man
of
strong
personal
aversions
his
nerves
had
not
been
at
the
mercy
of
the
mystical
qualities
of
his
neighbors
but
here
was
a
man
towards
whom
he
was
irresistibly
in
opposition
a
man
of
forms
and
phrases
and
postures
a
man
full
of
possible
impertinences
and
treacheries
de
bellegarde
made
him
feel
as
if
he
were
standing
on
a
marble
floor
and
yet
to
gain
his
desire
newman
felt
perfectly
able
to
stand
he
wondered
what
madame
de
cintré
thought
of
his
being
accepted
if
accepted
it
was
there
was
no
judging
from
her
face
which
expressed
simply
the
desire
to
be
gracious
in
a
manner
which
should
require
as
little
explicit
recognition
as
possible
young
madame
de
bellegarde
had
always
the
same
manners
she
was
always
preoccupied
distracted
listening
to
everything
and
hearing
nothing
looking
at
her
dress
her
rings
her
seeming
rather
bored
and
yet
puzzling
you
to
decide
what
was
her
ideal
of
social
diversion
newman
was
enlightened
on
this
point
later
even
valentin
did
not
quite
seem
master
of
his
wits
his
vivacity
was
fitful
and
forced
yet
newman
observed
that
in
the
lapses
of
his
talk
he
appeared
excited
his
eyes
had
an
intenser
spark
than
usual
the
effect
of
all
this
was
that
newman
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
was
not
himself
that
he
measured
his
movements
and
counted
his
words
and
resolved
that
if
the
occasion
demanded
that
he
should
appear
to
have
swallowed
a
ramrod
he
would
meet
the
emergency
after
dinner
de
bellegarde
proposed
to
his
guest
that
they
should
go
into
the
and
he
led
the
way
toward
a
small
somewhat
musty
apartment
the
walls
of
which
were
ornamented
with
old
hangings
of
stamped
leather
and
trophies
of
rusty
arms
newman
refused
a
cigar
but
he
established
himself
upon
one
of
the
divans
while
the
marquis
puffed
his
own
weed
before
the
and
valentin
sat
looking
through
the
light
fumes
of
a
cigarette
from
one
to
the
other
i
can
t
keep
quiet
any
longer
said
valentin
at
last
i
must
tell
you
the
news
and
congratulate
you
my
brother
seems
unable
to
come
to
the
point
he
revolves
around
his
announcement
like
the
priest
around
the
altar
you
are
accepted
as
a
candidate
for
the
hand
of
our
valentin
be
a
little
proper
murmured
the
marquis
with
a
look
of
the
most
delicate
irritation
contracting
the
bridge
of
his
high
nose
there
has
been
a
family
council
the
young
man
continued
my
mother
and
urbain
have
put
their
heads
together
and
even
my
testimony
has
not
been
altogether
excluded
my
mother
and
the
marquis
sat
at
a
table
covered
with
green
cloth
my
and
i
were
on
a
bench
against
the
wall
it
was
like
a
committee
at
the
corps
législatif
we
were
called
up
one
after
the
other
to
testify
we
spoke
of
you
very
handsomely
madame
de
bellegarde
said
that
if
she
had
not
been
told
who
you
were
she
would
have
taken
you
for
a
duke
an
american
duke
the
duke
of
california
i
said
that
i
could
warrant
you
grateful
for
the
smallest
favors
modest
humble
unassuming
i
was
sure
that
you
would
know
your
own
place
always
and
never
give
us
occasion
to
remind
you
of
certain
differences
after
all
you
couldn
t
help
it
if
you
were
not
a
duke
there
were
none
in
your
country
but
if
there
had
been
it
was
certain
that
smart
and
active
as
you
are
you
would
have
got
the
pick
of
the
titles
at
this
point
i
was
ordered
to
sit
down
but
i
think
i
made
an
impression
in
your
de
bellegarde
looked
at
his
brother
with
dangerous
coldness
and
gave
a
smile
as
thin
as
the
edge
of
a
knife
then
he
removed
a
spark
of
from
the
sleeve
of
his
coat
he
fixed
his
eyes
for
a
while
on
the
cornice
of
the
room
and
at
last
he
inserted
one
of
his
white
hands
into
the
breast
of
his
waistcoat
i
must
apologize
to
you
for
the
deplorable
levity
of
my
brother
he
said
and
i
must
notify
you
that
this
is
probably
not
the
last
time
that
his
want
of
tact
will
cause
you
serious
no
i
confess
i
have
no
tact
said
valentin
is
your
embarrassment
really
painful
newman
the
marquis
will
put
you
right
again
his
own
touch
is
deliciously
valentin
i
am
sorry
to
say
the
marquis
continued
has
never
possessed
the
tone
the
manner
that
belongs
to
a
young
man
in
his
position
it
has
been
a
great
affliction
to
his
mother
who
is
very
fond
of
the
old
traditions
but
you
must
remember
that
he
speaks
for
no
one
but
oh
i
don
t
mind
him
sir
said
newman
i
know
what
he
amounts
in
the
good
old
times
said
valentin
marquises
and
counts
used
to
have
their
appointed
fools
and
jesters
to
crack
jokes
for
them
nowadays
we
see
a
great
strapping
democrat
keeping
a
count
about
him
to
play
the
fool
it
s
a
good
situation
but
i
certainly
am
very
de
bellegarde
fixed
his
eyes
for
some
time
on
the
floor
my
mother
informed
me
he
said
presently
of
the
announcement
that
you
made
to
her
the
other
that
i
desired
to
marry
your
sister
said
newman
that
you
wished
to
arrange
a
marriage
said
the
marquis
slowly
with
my
sister
the
comtesse
de
cintré
the
proposal
was
serious
and
required
on
my
mother
s
part
a
great
deal
of
reflection
she
naturally
took
me
into
her
counsels
and
i
gave
my
most
zealous
attention
to
the
subject
there
was
a
great
deal
to
be
considered
more
than
you
appear
to
imagine
we
have
viewed
the
question
on
all
its
faces
we
have
weighed
one
thing
against
another
our
conclusion
has
been
that
we
favor
your
suit
my
mother
has
desired
me
to
inform
you
of
our
decision
she
will
have
the
honor
of
saying
a
few
words
to
you
on
the
subject
herself
meanwhile
by
us
the
heads
of
the
family
you
are
newman
got
up
and
came
nearer
to
the
marquis
you
will
do
nothing
to
hinder
me
and
all
you
can
to
help
me
eh
i
will
recommend
my
sister
to
accept
newman
passed
his
hand
over
his
face
and
pressed
it
for
a
moment
upon
his
eyes
this
promise
had
a
great
sound
and
yet
the
pleasure
he
took
in
it
was
embittered
by
his
having
to
stand
there
so
and
receive
his
passport
from
de
bellegarde
the
idea
of
having
this
gentleman
mixed
up
with
his
wooing
and
wedding
was
more
and
more
disagreeable
to
him
but
newman
had
resolved
to
go
through
the
mill
as
he
imagined
it
and
he
would
not
cry
out
at
the
first
turn
of
the
wheel
he
was
silent
a
while
and
then
he
said
with
a
certain
dryness
which
valentin
told
him
afterwards
had
a
very
grand
air
i
am
much
obliged
to
i
take
note
of
the
promise
said
valentin
i
register
the
de
bellegarde
began
to
gaze
at
the
cornice
again
he
apparently
had
something
more
to
say
i
must
do
my
mother
the
justice
he
resumed
i
must
do
myself
the
justice
to
say
that
our
decision
was
not
easy
such
an
arrangement
was
not
what
we
had
expected
the
idea
that
my
sister
should
marry
a
gentleman
ah
in
business
was
something
of
a
so
i
told
you
you
know
said
valentin
raising
his
finger
at
newman
the
novelty
has
not
quite
worn
away
i
confess
the
marquis
went
on
perhaps
it
never
will
entirely
but
possibly
that
is
not
altogether
to
be
regretted
and
he
gave
his
thin
smile
again
it
may
be
that
the
time
has
come
when
we
should
make
some
concession
to
novelty
there
had
been
no
novelties
in
our
house
for
a
great
many
years
i
made
the
observation
to
my
mother
and
she
did
me
the
honor
to
admit
that
it
was
worthy
of
my
dear
brother
interrupted
valentin
is
not
your
memory
just
here
leading
you
the
least
bit
astray
our
mother
is
i
may
say
distinguished
for
her
small
respect
of
abstract
reasoning
are
you
very
sure
that
she
replied
to
your
striking
proposition
in
the
gracious
manner
you
describe
you
know
how
terribly
incisive
she
is
sometimes
didn
t
she
rather
do
you
the
honor
to
say
a
fiddlestick
for
your
phrases
there
are
better
reasons
than
that
other
reasons
were
discussed
said
the
marquis
without
looking
at
valentin
but
with
an
audible
tremor
in
his
voice
some
of
them
possibly
were
better
we
are
conservative
newman
but
we
are
not
also
bigots
we
judged
the
matter
liberally
we
have
no
doubt
that
everything
will
be
newman
had
stood
listening
to
these
remarks
with
his
arms
folded
and
his
eyes
fastened
upon
de
bellegarde
comfortable
he
said
with
a
sort
of
grim
flatness
of
intonation
why
shouldn
t
we
be
comfortable
if
you
are
not
it
will
be
your
own
fault
i
have
everything
to
make
my
brother
means
that
with
the
lapse
of
time
you
may
get
used
to
the
change
and
valentin
paused
to
light
another
cigarette
what
change
asked
newman
in
the
same
tone
urbain
said
valentin
very
gravely
i
am
afraid
that
newman
does
not
quite
realize
the
change
we
ought
to
insist
upon
my
brother
goes
too
far
said
de
bellegarde
it
is
his
fatal
want
of
tact
again
it
is
my
mother
s
wish
and
mine
that
no
such
allusions
should
be
made
pray
never
make
them
yourself
we
prefer
to
assume
that
the
person
accepted
as
the
possible
husband
of
my
sister
is
one
of
ourselves
and
that
he
should
have
no
explanations
to
make
with
a
little
discretion
on
both
sides
everything
i
think
will
be
easy
that
is
exactly
what
i
wished
to
say
that
we
quite
understand
what
we
have
undertaken
and
that
you
may
depend
upon
our
adhering
to
our
valentin
shook
his
hands
in
the
air
and
then
buried
his
face
in
them
i
have
less
tact
than
i
might
have
no
doubt
but
oh
my
brother
if
you
knew
what
you
yourself
were
saying
and
he
went
off
into
a
long
laugh
de
bellegarde
s
face
flushed
a
little
but
he
held
his
head
higher
as
if
to
repudiate
this
concession
to
vulgar
perturbability
i
am
sure
you
understand
me
he
said
to
newman
oh
no
i
don
t
understand
you
at
all
said
newman
but
you
needn
t
mind
that
i
don
t
care
in
fact
i
think
i
had
better
not
understand
you
i
might
not
like
it
that
wouldn
t
suit
me
at
all
you
know
i
want
to
marry
your
sister
that
s
all
to
do
it
as
quickly
as
possible
and
to
find
fault
with
nothing
i
don
t
care
how
i
do
it
i
am
not
marrying
you
you
know
sir
i
have
got
my
leave
and
that
is
all
i
you
had
better
receive
the
last
word
from
my
mother
said
the
marquis
very
good
i
will
go
and
get
it
said
newman
and
he
prepared
to
return
to
the
de
bellegarde
made
a
motion
for
him
to
pass
first
and
when
newman
had
gone
out
he
shut
himself
into
the
room
with
valentin
newman
had
been
a
trifle
bewildered
by
the
audacious
irony
of
the
younger
brother
and
he
had
not
needed
its
aid
to
point
the
moral
of
de
bellegarde
s
transcendent
patronage
he
had
wit
enough
to
appreciate
the
force
of
that
civility
which
consists
in
calling
your
attention
to
the
impertinences
it
spares
you
but
he
had
felt
warmly
the
delicate
sympathy
with
himself
that
underlay
valentin
s
fraternal
irreverence
and
he
was
most
unwilling
that
his
friend
should
pay
a
tax
upon
it
he
paused
a
moment
in
the
corridor
after
he
had
gone
a
few
steps
expecting
to
hear
the
resonance
of
de
bellegarde
s
displeasure
but
he
detected
only
a
perfect
stillness
the
stillness
itself
seemed
a
trifle
portentous
he
reflected
however
that
he
had
no
right
to
stand
listening
and
he
made
his
way
back
to
the
salon
in
his
absence
several
persons
had
come
in
they
were
scattered
about
the
room
in
groups
two
or
three
of
them
having
passed
into
a
small
boudoir
next
to
the
which
had
now
been
lighted
and
opened
old
madame
de
bellegarde
was
in
her
place
by
the
fire
talking
to
a
very
old
gentleman
in
a
wig
and
a
profuse
white
neck
cloth
of
the
fashion
of
madame
de
cintré
was
bending
a
listening
head
to
the
historic
confidences
of
an
old
lady
who
was
presumably
the
wife
of
the
old
gentleman
in
the
neckcloth
an
old
lady
in
a
red
satin
dress
and
an
ermine
cape
who
wore
across
her
forehead
a
band
with
a
topaz
set
in
it
young
madame
de
bellegarde
when
newman
came
in
left
some
people
among
whom
she
was
sitting
and
took
the
place
that
she
had
occupied
before
dinner
then
she
gave
a
little
push
to
the
puff
that
stood
near
her
and
by
a
glance
at
newman
seemed
to
indicate
that
she
had
placed
it
in
position
for
him
he
went
and
took
possession
of
it
the
marquis
s
wife
amused
and
puzzled
him
i
know
your
secret
she
said
in
her
bad
but
charming
english
you
need
make
no
mystery
of
it
you
wish
to
marry
my
est
un
beau
a
man
like
you
ought
to
marry
a
tall
thin
woman
you
must
know
that
i
have
spoken
in
your
favor
you
owe
me
a
famous
taper
you
have
spoken
to
madame
de
cintré
said
newman
oh
no
not
that
you
may
think
it
strange
but
my
and
i
are
not
so
intimate
as
that
no
i
spoke
to
my
husband
and
my
i
said
i
was
sure
we
could
do
what
we
chose
with
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
said
newman
laughing
but
you
can
i
know
that
very
well
i
didn
t
believe
a
word
of
it
but
i
wanted
you
to
come
into
the
house
i
thought
we
should
be
i
am
very
sure
of
it
said
newman
don
t
be
too
sure
if
you
like
madame
de
cintré
so
much
perhaps
you
will
not
like
me
we
are
as
different
as
blue
and
pink
but
you
and
i
have
something
in
common
i
have
come
into
this
family
by
marriage
you
want
to
come
into
it
in
the
same
oh
no
i
don
t
interrupted
newman
i
only
want
to
take
madame
de
cintré
out
of
well
to
cast
your
nets
you
have
to
go
into
the
water
our
positions
are
alike
we
shall
be
able
to
compare
notes
what
do
you
think
of
my
husband
it
s
a
strange
question
isn
t
it
but
i
shall
ask
you
some
stranger
ones
perhaps
a
stranger
one
will
be
easier
to
answer
said
newman
you
might
try
oh
you
get
off
very
well
the
old
comte
de
la
rochefidèle
yonder
couldn
t
do
it
better
i
told
them
that
if
we
only
gave
you
a
chance
you
would
be
a
perfect
i
know
something
about
men
besides
you
and
i
belong
to
the
same
camp
i
am
a
ferocious
democrat
by
birth
i
am
a
good
little
bit
of
the
history
of
france
is
the
history
of
my
family
oh
you
never
heard
of
us
of
course
que
c
est
que
la
gloire
we
are
much
better
than
the
bellegardes
at
any
rate
but
i
don
t
care
a
pin
for
my
pedigree
i
want
to
belong
to
my
time
i
m
a
revolutionist
a
radical
a
child
of
the
age
i
am
sure
i
go
beyond
you
i
like
clever
people
wherever
they
come
from
and
i
take
my
amusement
wherever
i
find
it
i
don
t
pout
at
the
empire
here
all
the
world
pouts
at
the
empire
of
course
i
have
to
mind
what
i
say
but
i
expect
to
take
my
revenge
with
madame
de
bellegarde
discoursed
for
some
time
longer
in
this
sympathetic
strain
with
an
eager
abundance
which
seemed
to
indicate
that
her
opportunities
for
revealing
her
esoteric
philosophy
were
indeed
rare
she
hoped
that
newman
would
never
be
afraid
of
her
however
he
might
be
with
the
others
for
really
she
went
very
far
indeed
strong
people
gens
were
in
her
opinion
equal
all
the
world
over
newman
listened
to
her
with
an
attention
at
once
beguiled
and
irritated
he
wondered
what
the
deuce
she
too
was
driving
at
with
her
hope
that
he
would
not
be
afraid
of
her
and
her
protestations
of
equality
in
so
far
as
he
could
understand
her
she
was
wrong
a
silly
rattling
woman
was
certainly
not
the
equal
of
a
sensible
man
preoccupied
with
an
ambitious
passion
madame
de
bellegarde
stopped
suddenly
and
looked
at
him
sharply
shaking
her
fan
i
see
you
don
t
believe
me
she
said
you
are
too
much
on
your
guard
you
will
not
form
an
alliance
offensive
or
defensive
you
are
very
wrong
i
could
help
newman
answered
that
he
was
very
grateful
and
that
he
would
certainly
ask
for
help
she
should
see
but
first
of
all
he
said
i
must
help
and
he
went
to
join
madame
de
cintré
i
have
been
telling
madame
de
la
rochefidèle
that
you
are
an
american
she
said
as
he
came
up
it
interests
her
greatly
her
father
went
over
with
the
french
troops
to
help
you
in
your
battles
in
the
last
century
and
she
has
always
in
consequence
wanted
greatly
to
see
an
american
but
she
has
never
succeeded
till
you
are
the
first
to
her
knowledge
that
she
has
ever
looked
madame
de
la
rochefidèle
had
an
aged
cadaverous
face
with
a
falling
of
the
lower
jaw
which
prevented
her
from
bringing
her
lips
together
and
reduced
her
conversations
to
a
series
of
impressive
but
inarticulate
gutturals
she
raised
an
antique
eyeglass
elaborately
mounted
in
chased
silver
and
looked
at
newman
from
head
to
foot
then
she
said
something
to
which
he
listened
deferentially
but
which
he
completely
failed
to
understand
madame
de
la
rochefidèle
says
that
she
is
convinced
that
she
must
have
seen
americans
without
knowing
it
madame
de
cintré
explained
newman
thought
it
probable
she
had
seen
a
great
many
things
without
knowing
it
and
the
old
lady
again
addressing
herself
to
utterance
declared
as
interpreted
by
madame
de
cintré
that
she
wished
she
had
known
it
at
this
moment
the
old
gentleman
who
had
been
talking
to
the
elder
madame
de
bellegarde
drew
near
leading
the
marquise
on
his
arm
his
wife
pointed
out
newman
to
him
apparently
explaining
his
remarkable
origin
de
la
rochefidèle
whose
old
age
was
rosy
and
rotund
spoke
very
neatly
and
clearly
almost
as
prettily
newman
thought
as
nioche
when
he
had
been
enlightened
he
turned
to
newman
with
an
inimitable
elderly
grace
monsieur
is
by
no
means
the
first
american
that
i
have
seen
he
said
almost
the
first
person
i
ever
saw
to
notice
him
was
an
ah
said
newman
sympathetically
the
great
franklin
said
de
la
rochefidèle
of
course
i
was
very
young
he
was
received
very
well
in
our
not
better
than
newman
said
madame
de
bellegarde
i
beg
he
will
offer
his
arm
into
the
other
room
i
could
have
offered
no
higher
privilege
to
newman
complying
with
madame
de
bellegarde
s
request
perceived
that
her
two
sons
had
returned
to
the
he
scanned
their
faces
an
instant
for
traces
of
the
scene
that
had
followed
his
separation
from
them
but
the
marquis
seemed
neither
more
nor
less
frigidly
grand
than
usual
and
valentin
was
kissing
ladies
hands
with
at
least
his
habitual
air
of
to
the
act
madame
de
bellegarde
gave
a
glance
at
her
eldest
son
and
by
the
time
she
had
crossed
the
threshold
of
her
boudoir
he
was
at
her
side
the
room
was
now
empty
and
offered
a
sufficient
degree
of
privacy
the
old
lady
disengaged
herself
from
newman
s
arm
and
rested
her
hand
on
the
arm
of
the
marquis
and
in
this
position
she
stood
a
moment
holding
her
head
high
and
biting
her
small
i
am
afraid
the
picture
was
lost
upon
newman
but
madame
de
bellegarde
was
in
fact
at
this
moment
a
striking
image
of
the
dignity
which
even
in
the
case
of
a
little
old
lady
may
reside
in
the
habit
of
unquestioned
authority
and
the
absoluteness
of
a
social
theory
favorable
to
yourself
my
son
has
spoken
to
you
as
i
desired
she
said
and
you
understand
that
we
shall
not
interfere
the
rest
will
lie
with
m
de
bellegarde
told
me
several
things
i
didn
t
understand
said
newman
but
i
made
out
that
you
will
leave
me
open
field
i
am
much
i
wish
to
add
a
word
that
my
son
probably
did
not
feel
at
liberty
to
say
the
marquise
rejoined
i
must
say
it
for
my
own
peace
of
mind
we
are
stretching
a
point
we
are
doing
you
a
great
oh
your
son
said
it
very
well
didn
t
you
said
newman
not
so
well
as
my
mother
declared
the
marquis
i
can
only
repeat
i
am
much
it
is
proper
i
should
tell
you
madame
de
bellegarde
went
on
that
i
am
very
proud
and
that
i
hold
my
head
very
high
i
may
be
wrong
but
i
am
too
old
to
change
at
least
i
know
it
and
i
don
t
pretend
to
anything
else
don
t
flatter
yourself
that
my
daughter
is
not
proud
she
is
proud
in
her
own
way
a
somewhat
different
way
from
mine
you
will
have
to
make
your
terms
with
that
even
valentin
is
proud
if
you
touch
the
right
spot
or
the
wrong
one
urbain
is
proud
that
you
see
for
yourself
sometimes
i
think
he
is
a
little
too
proud
but
i
wouldn
t
change
him
he
is
the
best
of
my
children
he
cleaves
to
his
old
mother
but
i
have
said
enough
to
show
you
that
we
are
all
proud
together
it
is
well
that
you
should
know
the
sort
of
people
you
have
come
well
said
newman
i
can
only
say
in
return
that
i
am
proud
i
shan
t
mind
you
but
you
speak
as
if
you
intended
to
be
very
i
shall
not
enjoy
having
my
daughter
marry
you
and
i
shall
not
pretend
to
enjoy
it
if
you
don
t
mind
that
so
much
the
if
you
stick
to
your
own
side
of
the
contract
we
shall
not
quarrel
that
is
all
i
ask
of
you
said
newman
keep
your
hands
off
and
give
me
an
open
field
i
am
very
much
in
earnest
and
there
is
not
the
slightest
danger
of
my
getting
discouraged
or
backing
out
you
will
have
me
constantly
before
your
eyes
if
you
don
t
like
it
i
am
sorry
for
you
i
will
do
for
your
daughter
if
she
will
accept
me
everything
that
a
man
can
do
for
a
woman
i
am
happy
to
tell
you
that
as
a
promise
a
pledge
i
consider
that
on
your
side
you
make
me
an
equal
pledge
you
will
not
back
out
eh
i
don
t
know
what
you
mean
by
backing
out
said
the
marquise
it
suggests
a
movement
of
which
i
think
no
bellegarde
has
ever
been
our
word
is
our
word
said
urbain
we
have
given
well
now
said
newman
i
am
very
glad
you
are
so
proud
it
makes
me
believe
that
you
will
keep
the
marquise
was
silent
a
moment
and
then
suddenly
i
shall
always
be
polite
to
you
newman
she
declared
but
decidedly
i
shall
never
like
don
t
be
too
sure
said
newman
laughing
i
am
so
sure
that
i
will
ask
you
to
take
me
back
to
my
armchair
without
the
least
fear
of
having
my
sentiments
modified
by
the
service
you
render
and
madame
de
bellegarde
took
his
arm
and
returned
to
the
salon
and
to
her
customary
place
de
la
rochefidèle
and
his
wife
were
preparing
to
take
their
leave
and
madame
de
cintré
s
interview
with
the
mumbling
old
lady
was
at
an
end
she
stood
looking
about
her
asking
herself
apparently
to
whom
she
should
next
speak
when
newman
came
up
to
her
your
mother
has
given
me
leave
very
solemnly
to
come
here
often
he
said
i
mean
to
come
i
shall
be
glad
to
see
you
she
answered
simply
and
then
in
a
moment
you
probably
think
it
very
strange
that
there
should
be
such
a
solemnity
as
you
say
about
your
well
yes
i
do
do
you
remember
what
my
brother
valentin
said
the
first
time
you
came
to
see
me
that
we
were
a
strange
strange
family
it
was
not
the
first
time
i
came
but
the
second
said
newman
very
true
valentin
annoyed
me
at
the
time
but
now
i
know
you
better
i
may
tell
you
he
was
right
if
you
come
often
you
will
see
and
madame
de
cintré
turned
away
newman
watched
her
a
while
talking
with
other
people
and
then
he
took
his
leave
he
shook
hands
last
with
valentin
de
bellegarde
who
came
out
with
him
to
the
top
of
the
staircase
well
you
have
got
your
permit
said
valentin
i
hope
you
liked
the
i
like
your
sister
more
than
ever
but
don
t
worry
your
brother
any
more
for
my
sake
newman
added
i
don
t
mind
him
i
am
afraid
he
came
down
on
you
in
the
after
i
went
when
my
brother
comes
down
on
me
said
valentin
he
falls
hard
i
have
a
peculiar
way
of
receiving
him
i
must
say
he
continued
that
they
came
up
to
the
mark
much
sooner
than
i
expected
i
don
t
understand
it
they
must
have
had
to
turn
the
screw
pretty
tight
it
s
a
tribute
to
your
well
it
s
the
most
precious
one
they
have
ever
received
said
newman
he
was
turning
away
when
valentin
stopped
him
looking
at
him
with
a
brilliant
glance
i
should
like
to
know
whether
within
a
few
days
you
have
seen
your
venerable
friend
he
was
yesterday
at
my
rooms
newman
answered
what
did
he
tell
you
nothing
you
didn
t
see
the
muzzle
of
a
pistol
sticking
out
of
his
pocket
what
are
you
driving
at
newman
demanded
i
thought
he
seemed
rather
cheerful
for
valentin
broke
into
a
laugh
i
am
delighted
to
hear
it
i
win
my
bet
mademoiselle
noémie
has
thrown
her
cap
over
the
mill
as
we
say
she
has
left
the
paternal
domicile
she
is
launched
and
nioche
is
rather
cheerful
him
don
t
brandish
your
tomahawk
at
that
rate
i
have
not
seen
her
nor
communicated
with
her
since
that
day
at
the
louvre
andromeda
has
found
another
perseus
than
i
my
information
is
exact
on
such
matters
it
always
is
i
suppose
that
now
you
will
raise
your
my
protest
be
hanged
murmured
newman
disgustedly
but
his
tone
found
no
echo
in
that
in
which
valentin
with
his
hand
on
the
door
to
return
to
his
mother
s
apartment
exclaimed
but
i
shall
see
her
now
she
is
very
remarkable
she
is
very
remarkable
chapter
xiii
newman
kept
his
promise
or
his
menace
of
going
often
to
the
rue
de
l
université
and
during
the
next
six
weeks
he
saw
madame
de
cintré
more
times
than
he
could
have
numbered
he
flattered
himself
that
he
was
not
in
love
but
his
biographer
may
be
supposed
to
know
better
he
claimed
at
least
none
of
the
exemptions
and
emoluments
of
the
romantic
passion
love
he
believed
made
a
fool
of
a
man
and
his
present
emotion
was
not
folly
but
wisdom
wisdom
sound
serene
what
he
felt
was
an
intense
tenderness
which
had
for
its
object
an
extraordinarily
graceful
and
delicate
and
at
the
same
time
impressive
woman
who
lived
in
a
large
gray
house
on
the
left
bank
of
the
seine
this
tenderness
turned
very
often
into
a
positive
heartache
a
sign
in
which
certainly
newman
ought
to
have
read
the
appellation
which
science
has
conferred
upon
his
sentiment
when
the
heart
has
a
heavy
weight
upon
it
it
hardly
matters
whether
the
weight
be
of
gold
or
of
lead
when
at
any
rate
happiness
passes
into
that
place
in
which
it
becomes
identical
with
pain
a
man
may
admit
that
the
reign
of
wisdom
is
temporarily
suspended
newman
wished
madame
de
cintré
so
well
that
nothing
he
could
think
of
doing
for
her
in
the
future
rose
to
the
high
standard
which
his
present
mood
had
set
itself
she
seemed
to
him
so
felicitous
a
product
of
nature
and
circumstance
that
his
invention
musing
on
future
combinations
was
constantly
catching
its
breath
with
the
fear
of
stumbling
into
some
brutal
compression
or
mutilation
of
her
beautiful
personal
harmony
this
is
what
i
mean
by
newman
s
tenderness
madame
de
cintré
pleased
him
so
exactly
as
she
was
that
his
desire
to
interpose
between
her
and
the
troubles
of
life
had
the
quality
of
a
young
mother
s
eagerness
to
protect
the
sleep
of
her
child
newman
was
simply
charmed
and
he
handled
his
charm
as
if
it
were
a
which
would
stop
if
one
shook
it
there
can
be
no
better
proof
of
the
hankering
epicure
that
is
hidden
in
every
man
s
temperament
waiting
for
a
signal
from
some
divine
confederate
that
he
may
safely
peep
out
newman
at
last
was
enjoying
purely
freely
deeply
certain
of
madame
de
cintré
s
personal
qualities
the
luminous
sweetness
of
her
eyes
the
delicate
mobility
of
her
face
the
deep
liquidity
of
her
voice
filled
all
his
consciousness
a
greek
of
old
gazing
at
a
marble
goddess
with
his
whole
bright
intellect
resting
satisfied
in
the
act
could
not
have
been
a
more
complete
embodiment
of
the
wisdom
that
loses
itself
in
the
enjoyment
of
quiet
harmonies
he
made
no
violent
love
to
her
no
sentimental
speeches
he
never
trespassed
on
what
she
had
made
him
understand
was
for
the
present
forbidden
ground
but
he
had
nevertheless
a
comfortable
sense
that
she
knew
better
from
day
to
day
how
much
he
admired
her
though
in
general
he
was
no
great
talker
he
talked
much
and
he
succeeded
perfectly
in
making
her
say
many
things
he
was
not
afraid
of
boring
her
either
by
his
discourse
or
by
his
silence
and
whether
or
no
he
did
occasionally
bore
her
it
is
probable
that
on
the
whole
she
liked
him
only
the
better
for
his
absence
of
embarrassed
scruples
her
visitors
coming
in
often
while
newman
sat
there
found
a
tall
lean
silent
man
in
a
attitude
who
laughed
out
sometimes
when
no
one
had
meant
to
be
droll
and
remained
grave
in
the
presence
of
calculated
witticisms
for
appreciation
of
which
he
had
apparently
not
the
proper
culture
it
must
be
confessed
that
the
number
of
subjects
upon
which
newman
had
no
ideas
was
extremely
large
and
it
must
be
added
that
as
regards
those
subjects
upon
which
he
was
without
ideas
he
was
also
perfectly
without
words
he
had
little
of
the
small
change
of
conversation
and
his
stock
of
formulas
and
phrases
was
the
scantiest
on
the
other
hand
he
had
plenty
of
attention
to
bestow
and
his
estimate
of
the
importance
of
a
topic
did
not
depend
upon
the
number
of
clever
things
he
could
say
about
it
he
himself
was
almost
never
bored
and
there
was
no
man
with
whom
it
would
have
been
a
greater
mistake
to
suppose
that
silence
meant
displeasure
what
it
was
that
entertained
him
during
some
of
his
speechless
sessions
i
must
however
confess
myself
unable
to
determine
we
know
in
a
general
way
that
a
great
many
things
which
were
old
stories
to
a
great
many
people
had
the
charm
of
novelty
to
him
but
a
complete
list
of
his
new
impressions
would
probably
contain
a
number
of
surprises
for
us
he
told
madame
de
cintré
a
hundred
long
stories
he
explained
to
her
in
talking
of
the
united
states
the
working
of
various
local
institutions
and
mercantile
customs
judging
by
the
sequel
she
was
interested
but
one
would
not
have
been
sure
of
it
beforehand
as
regards
her
own
talk
newman
was
very
sure
himself
that
she
herself
enjoyed
it
this
was
as
a
sort
of
amendment
to
the
portrait
that
tristram
had
drawn
of
her
he
discovered
that
she
had
naturally
an
abundance
of
gaiety
he
had
been
right
at
first
in
saying
she
was
shy
her
shyness
in
a
woman
whose
circumstances
and
tranquil
beauty
afforded
every
facility
for
hardihood
was
only
a
charm
the
more
for
newman
it
had
lasted
some
time
and
even
when
it
went
it
left
something
behind
it
which
for
a
while
performed
the
same
office
was
this
the
tearful
secret
of
which
tristram
had
had
a
glimpse
and
of
which
as
of
her
friend
s
reserve
her
and
her
profundity
she
had
given
a
sketch
of
which
the
outlines
were
perhaps
rather
too
heavy
newman
supposed
so
but
he
found
himself
wondering
less
every
day
what
madame
de
cintré
s
secrets
might
be
and
more
convinced
that
secrets
were
in
themselves
hateful
things
to
her
she
was
a
woman
for
the
light
not
for
the
shade
and
her
natural
line
was
not
picturesque
reserve
and
mysterious
melancholy
but
frank
joyous
brilliant
action
with
just
so
much
meditation
as
was
necessary
and
not
a
grain
more
to
this
apparently
he
had
succeeded
in
bringing
her
back
he
felt
himself
that
he
was
an
antidote
to
oppressive
secrets
what
he
offered
her
was
in
fact
above
all
things
a
vast
sunny
immunity
from
the
need
of
having
any
he
often
passed
his
evenings
when
madame
de
cintré
had
so
appointed
it
at
the
chilly
fireside
of
madame
de
bellegarde
contenting
himself
with
looking
across
the
room
through
narrowed
eyelids
at
his
mistress
who
always
made
a
point
before
her
family
of
talking
to
someone
else
madame
de
bellegarde
sat
by
the
fire
conversing
neatly
and
coldly
with
whomsoever
approached
her
and
glancing
round
the
room
with
her
eye
the
effect
of
which
when
it
lighted
upon
him
was
to
newman
s
sense
identical
with
that
of
a
sudden
spurt
of
damp
air
when
he
shook
hands
with
her
he
always
asked
her
with
a
laugh
whether
she
could
stand
him
another
evening
and
she
replied
without
a
laugh
that
thank
god
she
had
always
been
able
to
do
her
duty
newman
talking
once
of
the
marquise
to
tristram
said
that
after
all
it
was
very
easy
to
get
on
with
her
it
always
was
easy
to
get
on
with
rascals
and
is
it
by
that
elegant
term
said
tristram
that
you
designate
the
marquise
de
bellegarde
well
said
newman
she
is
wicked
she
is
an
old
what
is
her
crime
asked
tristram
i
shouldn
t
wonder
if
she
had
murdered
someone
all
from
a
sense
of
duty
of
how
can
you
be
so
dreadful
sighed
tristram
i
am
not
dreadful
i
am
speaking
of
her
pray
what
will
you
say
when
you
want
to
be
severe
i
shall
keep
my
severity
for
someone
else
for
the
marquis
there
s
a
man
i
can
t
swallow
mix
the
drink
as
i
and
what
has
done
i
can
t
quite
make
out
it
is
something
dreadfully
bad
something
mean
and
underhand
and
not
redeemed
by
audacity
as
his
mother
s
misdemeanors
may
have
been
if
he
has
never
committed
murder
he
has
at
least
turned
his
back
and
looked
the
other
way
while
someone
else
was
committing
in
spite
of
this
invidious
hypothesis
which
must
be
taken
for
nothing
more
than
an
example
of
the
capricious
play
of
american
humor
newman
did
his
best
to
maintain
an
easy
and
friendly
style
of
communication
with
de
bellegarde
so
long
as
he
was
in
personal
contact
with
people
he
disliked
extremely
to
have
anything
to
forgive
them
and
he
was
capable
of
a
good
deal
of
unsuspected
imaginative
effort
for
the
sake
of
his
own
personal
comfort
to
assume
for
the
time
that
they
were
good
fellows
he
did
his
best
to
treat
the
marquis
as
one
he
believed
honestly
moreover
that
he
could
not
in
reason
be
such
a
confounded
fool
as
he
seemed
newman
s
familiarity
was
never
importunate
his
sense
of
human
equality
was
not
an
aggressive
taste
or
an
æsthetic
theory
but
something
as
natural
and
organic
as
a
physical
appetite
which
had
never
been
put
on
a
scanty
allowance
and
consequently
was
innocent
of
ungraceful
eagerness
his
tranquil
unsuspectingness
of
the
relativity
of
his
own
place
in
the
social
scale
was
probably
irritating
to
de
bellegarde
who
saw
himself
reflected
in
the
mind
of
his
potential
in
a
crude
and
colorless
form
unpleasantly
dissimilar
to
the
impressive
image
projected
upon
his
own
intellectual
mirror
he
never
forgot
himself
for
an
instant
and
replied
to
what
he
must
have
considered
newman
s
advances
with
mechanical
politeness
newman
who
was
constantly
forgetting
himself
and
indulging
in
an
unlimited
amount
of
irresponsible
inquiry
and
conjecture
now
and
then
found
himself
confronted
by
the
conscious
ironical
smile
of
his
host
what
the
deuce
de
bellegarde
was
smiling
at
he
was
at
a
loss
to
divine
de
bellegarde
s
smile
may
be
supposed
to
have
been
for
himself
a
compromise
between
a
great
many
emotions
so
long
as
he
smiled
he
was
polite
and
it
was
proper
he
should
be
polite
a
smile
moreover
committed
him
to
nothing
more
than
politeness
and
left
the
degree
of
politeness
agreeably
vague
a
smile
too
was
neither
dissent
which
was
too
serious
nor
agreement
which
might
have
brought
on
terrible
complications
and
then
a
smile
covered
his
own
personal
dignity
which
in
this
critical
situation
he
was
resolved
to
keep
immaculate
it
was
quite
enough
that
the
glory
of
his
house
should
pass
into
eclipse
between
him
and
newman
his
whole
manner
seemed
to
declare
there
could
be
no
interchange
of
opinion
he
was
holding
his
breath
so
as
not
to
inhale
the
odor
of
democracy
newman
was
far
from
being
versed
in
european
politics
but
he
liked
to
have
a
general
idea
of
what
was
going
on
about
him
and
he
accordingly
asked
de
bellegarde
several
times
what
he
thought
of
public
affairs
de
bellegarde
answered
with
suave
concision
that
he
thought
as
ill
of
them
as
possible
that
they
were
going
from
bad
to
worse
and
that
the
age
was
rotten
to
its
core
this
gave
newman
for
the
moment
an
almost
kindly
feeling
for
the
marquis
he
pitied
a
man
for
whom
the
world
was
so
cheerless
a
place
and
the
next
time
he
saw
de
bellegarde
he
attempted
to
call
his
attention
to
some
of
the
brilliant
features
of
the
time
the
marquis
presently
replied
that
he
had
but
a
single
political
conviction
which
was
enough
for
him
he
believed
in
the
divine
right
of
henry
of
bourbon
fifth
of
his
name
to
the
throne
of
france
newman
stared
and
after
this
he
ceased
to
talk
politics
with
de
bellegarde
he
was
not
horrified
nor
scandalized
he
was
not
even
amused
he
felt
as
he
should
have
felt
if
he
had
discovered
in
de
bellegarde
a
taste
for
certain
oddities
of
diet
an
appetite
for
instance
for
fishbones
or
nutshells
under
these
circumstances
of
course
he
would
never
have
broached
dietary
questions
with
him
one
afternoon
on
his
calling
on
madame
de
cintré
newman
was
requested
by
the
servant
to
wait
a
few
moments
as
his
hostess
was
not
at
liberty
he
walked
about
the
room
a
while
taking
up
her
books
smelling
her
flowers
and
looking
at
her
prints
and
photographs
which
he
thought
prodigiously
pretty
and
at
last
he
heard
the
opening
of
a
door
to
which
his
back
was
turned
on
the
threshold
stood
an
old
woman
whom
he
remembered
to
have
met
several
times
in
entering
and
leaving
the
house
she
was
tall
and
straight
and
dressed
in
black
and
she
wore
a
cap
which
if
newman
had
been
initiated
into
such
mysteries
would
have
been
a
sufficient
assurance
that
she
was
not
a
frenchwoman
a
cap
of
pure
british
composition
she
had
a
pale
decent
face
and
a
clear
dull
english
eye
she
looked
at
newman
a
moment
both
intently
and
timidly
and
then
she
dropped
a
short
straight
english
curtsey
madame
de
cintré
begs
you
will
kindly
wait
she
said
she
has
just
come
in
she
will
soon
have
finished
oh
i
will
wait
as
long
as
she
wants
said
newman
pray
tell
her
not
to
thank
you
sir
said
the
woman
softly
and
then
instead
of
retiring
with
her
message
she
advanced
into
the
room
she
looked
about
her
for
a
moment
and
presently
went
to
a
table
and
began
to
arrange
certain
books
and
newman
was
struck
with
the
high
respectability
of
her
appearance
he
was
afraid
to
address
her
as
a
servant
she
busied
herself
for
some
moments
with
putting
the
table
in
order
and
pulling
the
curtains
straight
while
newman
walked
slowly
to
and
fro
he
perceived
at
last
from
her
reflection
in
the
mirror
as
he
was
passing
that
her
hands
were
idle
and
that
she
was
looking
at
him
intently
she
evidently
wished
to
say
something
and
newman
perceiving
it
helped
her
to
begin
you
are
english
he
asked
yes
sir
please
she
answered
quickly
and
softly
i
was
born
in
and
what
do
you
think
of
paris
oh
i
don
t
think
of
paris
sir
she
said
in
the
same
tone
it
is
so
long
since
i
have
been
ah
you
have
been
here
very
long
it
is
more
than
forty
years
sir
i
came
over
with
lady
you
mean
with
old
madame
de
bellegarde
yes
sir
i
came
with
her
when
she
was
married
i
was
my
lady
s
own
and
you
have
been
with
her
ever
since
i
have
been
in
the
house
ever
since
my
lady
has
taken
a
younger
person
you
see
i
am
very
old
i
do
nothing
regular
now
but
i
keep
you
look
very
strong
and
well
said
newman
observing
the
erectness
of
her
figure
and
a
certain
venerable
rosiness
in
her
cheek
thank
god
i
am
not
ill
sir
i
hope
i
know
my
duty
too
well
to
go
panting
and
coughing
about
the
house
but
i
am
an
old
woman
sir
and
it
is
as
an
old
woman
that
i
venture
to
speak
to
oh
speak
out
said
newman
curiously
you
needn
t
be
afraid
of
yes
sir
i
think
you
are
kind
i
have
seen
you
on
the
stairs
you
mean
yes
sir
when
you
have
been
coming
to
see
the
countess
i
have
taken
the
liberty
of
noticing
that
you
come
oh
yes
i
come
very
often
said
newman
laughing
you
need
not
have
been
to
notice
i
have
noticed
it
with
pleasure
sir
said
the
ancient
tirewoman
gravely
and
she
stood
looking
at
newman
with
a
strange
expression
of
face
the
old
instinct
of
deference
and
humility
was
there
the
habit
of
decent
and
knowledge
of
her
own
but
there
mingled
with
it
a
certain
mild
audacity
born
of
the
occasion
and
of
a
sense
probably
of
newman
s
unprecedented
approachableness
and
beyond
this
a
vague
indifference
to
the
old
proprieties
as
if
my
lady
s
own
woman
had
at
last
begun
to
reflect
that
since
my
lady
had
taken
another
person
she
had
a
slight
reversionary
property
in
herself
you
take
a
great
interest
in
the
family
said
newman
a
deep
interest
sir
especially
in
the
i
am
glad
of
that
said
newman
and
in
a
moment
he
added
smiling
so
do
i
so
i
suppose
sir
we
can
t
help
noticing
these
things
and
having
our
ideas
can
we
sir
you
mean
as
a
servant
said
newman
ah
there
it
is
sir
i
am
afraid
that
when
i
let
my
thoughts
meddle
with
such
matters
i
am
no
longer
a
servant
but
i
am
so
devoted
to
the
countess
if
she
were
my
own
child
i
couldn
t
love
her
more
that
is
how
i
come
to
be
so
bold
sir
they
say
you
want
to
marry
newman
eyed
his
interlocutress
and
satisfied
himself
that
she
was
not
a
gossip
but
a
zealot
she
looked
anxious
appealing
discreet
it
is
quite
true
he
said
i
want
to
marry
madame
de
and
to
take
her
away
to
america
i
will
take
her
wherever
she
wants
to
the
farther
away
the
better
sir
exclaimed
the
old
woman
with
sudden
intensity
but
she
checked
herself
and
taking
up
a
in
mosaic
began
to
polish
it
with
her
black
apron
i
don
t
mean
anything
against
the
house
or
the
family
sir
but
i
think
a
great
change
would
do
the
poor
countess
good
it
is
very
sad
yes
it
s
not
very
lively
said
newman
but
madame
de
cintré
is
gay
she
is
everything
that
is
good
you
will
not
be
vexed
to
hear
that
she
has
been
gayer
for
a
couple
of
months
past
than
she
had
been
in
many
a
day
newman
was
delighted
to
gather
this
testimony
to
the
prosperity
of
his
suit
but
he
repressed
all
violent
marks
of
elation
has
madame
de
cintré
been
in
bad
spirits
before
this
he
asked
poor
lady
she
had
good
reason
de
cintré
was
no
husband
for
a
sweet
young
lady
like
that
and
then
as
i
say
it
has
been
a
sad
house
it
is
better
in
my
humble
opinion
that
she
were
out
of
it
so
if
you
will
excuse
me
for
saying
so
i
hope
she
will
marry
i
hope
she
will
said
newman
but
you
must
not
lose
courage
sir
if
she
doesn
t
make
up
her
mind
at
once
that
is
what
i
wanted
to
beg
of
you
sir
don
t
give
it
up
sir
you
will
not
take
it
ill
if
i
say
it
s
a
great
risk
for
any
lady
at
any
time
all
the
more
when
she
has
got
rid
of
one
bad
bargain
but
if
she
can
marry
a
good
kind
respectable
gentleman
i
think
she
had
better
make
up
her
mind
to
it
they
speak
very
well
of
you
sir
in
the
house
and
if
you
will
allow
me
to
say
so
i
like
your
face
you
have
a
very
different
appearance
from
the
late
count
he
wasn
t
five
feet
high
and
they
say
your
fortune
is
beyond
everything
there
s
no
harm
in
that
so
i
beseech
you
to
be
patient
sir
and
bide
your
time
if
i
don
t
say
this
to
you
sir
perhaps
no
one
will
of
course
it
is
not
for
me
to
make
any
promises
i
can
answer
for
nothing
but
i
think
your
chance
is
not
so
bad
sir
i
am
nothing
but
a
weary
old
woman
in
my
quiet
corner
but
one
woman
understands
another
and
i
think
i
make
out
the
countess
i
received
her
in
my
arms
when
she
came
into
the
world
and
her
first
wedding
day
was
the
saddest
of
my
life
she
owes
it
to
me
to
show
me
another
and
a
brighter
one
if
you
will
hold
firm
sir
and
you
look
as
if
you
would
i
think
we
may
see
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
encouragement
said
newman
heartily
one
can
t
have
too
much
i
mean
to
hold
firm
and
if
madame
de
cintré
marries
me
you
must
come
and
live
with
the
old
woman
looked
at
him
strangely
with
her
soft
lifeless
eyes
it
may
seem
a
heartless
thing
to
say
sir
when
one
has
been
forty
years
in
a
house
but
i
may
tell
you
that
i
should
like
to
leave
this
why
it
s
just
the
time
to
say
it
said
newman
fervently
after
forty
years
one
wants
a
you
are
very
kind
sir
and
this
faithful
servant
dropped
another
curtsey
and
seemed
disposed
to
retire
but
she
lingered
a
moment
and
gave
a
timid
joyless
smile
newman
was
disappointed
and
his
fingers
stole
half
shyly
half
irritably
into
his
his
informant
noticed
the
movement
thank
god
i
am
not
a
frenchwoman
she
said
if
i
were
i
would
tell
you
with
a
brazen
simper
old
as
i
am
that
if
you
please
monsieur
my
information
is
worth
something
let
me
tell
you
so
in
my
own
decent
english
way
it
worth
how
much
please
said
newman
simply
this
a
promise
not
to
hint
to
the
countess
that
i
have
said
these
if
that
is
all
you
have
it
said
newman
that
is
all
sir
thank
you
sir
good
day
and
having
once
more
slid
down
into
her
scanty
petticoats
the
old
woman
departed
at
the
same
moment
madame
de
cintré
came
in
by
an
opposite
door
she
noticed
the
movement
of
the
other
and
asked
newman
who
had
been
entertaining
him
the
british
female
said
newman
an
old
lady
in
a
black
dress
and
a
cap
who
curtsies
up
and
down
and
expresses
herself
ever
so
an
old
lady
who
curtsies
and
expresses
herself
ah
you
mean
poor
mrs
bread
i
happen
to
know
that
you
have
made
a
conquest
of
mrs
cake
she
ought
to
be
called
said
newman
she
is
very
sweet
she
is
a
delicious
old
madame
de
cintré
looked
at
him
a
moment
what
can
she
have
said
to
you
she
is
an
excellent
creature
but
we
think
her
rather
i
suppose
newman
answered
presently
that
i
like
her
because
she
has
lived
near
you
so
long
since
your
birth
she
told
yes
said
madame
de
cintré
simply
she
is
very
faithful
i
can
trust
newman
had
never
made
any
reflections
to
this
lady
upon
her
mother
and
her
brother
urbain
had
given
no
hint
of
the
impression
they
made
upon
him
but
as
if
she
had
guessed
his
thoughts
she
seemed
careful
to
avoid
all
occasion
for
making
him
speak
of
them
she
never
alluded
to
her
mother
s
domestic
decrees
she
never
quoted
the
opinions
of
the
marquis
they
had
talked
however
of
valentin
and
she
had
made
no
secret
of
her
extreme
affection
for
her
younger
brother
newman
listened
sometimes
with
a
certain
harmless
jealousy
he
would
have
liked
to
divert
some
of
her
tender
allusions
to
his
own
credit
once
madame
de
cintré
told
him
with
a
little
air
of
triumph
about
something
that
valentin
had
done
which
she
thought
very
much
to
his
honor
it
was
a
service
he
had
rendered
to
an
old
friend
of
the
family
something
more
serious
than
valentin
was
usually
supposed
capable
of
being
newman
said
he
was
glad
to
hear
of
it
and
then
began
to
talk
about
something
which
lay
upon
his
own
heart
madame
de
cintré
listened
but
after
a
while
she
said
i
don
t
like
the
way
you
speak
of
my
brother
hereupon
newman
surprised
said
that
he
had
never
spoken
of
him
but
kindly
it
is
too
kindly
said
madame
de
cintré
it
is
a
kindness
that
costs
nothing
it
is
the
kindness
you
show
to
a
child
it
is
as
if
you
didn
t
respect
respect
him
why
i
think
i
you
think
if
you
are
not
sure
it
is
no
do
you
respect
him
said
newman
if
you
do
i
if
one
loves
a
person
that
is
a
question
one
is
not
bound
to
answer
said
madame
de
cintré
you
should
not
have
asked
it
of
me
then
i
am
very
fond
of
your
he
amuses
you
but
you
would
not
like
to
resemble
i
shouldn
t
like
to
resemble
anyone
it
is
hard
enough
work
resembling
one
s
what
do
you
mean
asked
madame
de
cintré
by
resembling
one
s
self
why
doing
what
is
expected
of
one
doing
one
s
but
that
is
only
when
one
is
very
well
a
great
many
people
are
good
said
newman
valentin
is
quite
good
enough
for
madame
de
cintré
was
silent
for
a
short
time
he
is
not
good
enough
for
me
she
said
at
last
i
wish
he
would
do
what
can
he
do
asked
newman
nothing
yet
he
is
very
it
is
a
proof
of
cleverness
said
newman
to
be
happy
without
doing
i
don
t
think
valentin
is
happy
in
reality
he
is
clever
generous
brave
but
what
is
there
to
show
for
it
to
me
there
is
something
sad
in
his
life
and
sometimes
i
have
a
sort
of
foreboding
about
him
i
don
t
know
why
but
i
fancy
he
will
have
some
great
trouble
perhaps
an
unhappy
oh
leave
him
to
me
said
newman
jovially
i
will
watch
over
him
and
keep
harm
one
evening
in
madame
de
bellegarde
s
salon
the
conversation
had
flagged
most
sensibly
the
marquis
walked
up
and
down
in
silence
like
a
sentinel
at
the
door
of
some
citadel
of
the
proprieties
his
mother
sat
staring
at
the
fire
young
madame
de
bellegarde
worked
at
an
enormous
band
of
tapestry
usually
there
were
three
or
four
visitors
but
on
this
occasion
a
violent
storm
sufficiently
accounted
for
the
absence
of
even
the
most
devoted
habitués
in
the
long
silences
the
howling
of
the
wind
and
the
beating
of
the
rain
were
distinctly
audible
newman
sat
perfectly
still
watching
the
clock
determined
to
stay
till
the
stroke
of
eleven
but
not
a
moment
longer
madame
de
cintré
had
turned
her
back
to
the
circle
and
had
been
standing
for
some
time
within
the
uplifted
curtain
of
a
window
with
her
forehead
against
the
pane
gazing
out
into
the
deluged
darkness
suddenly
she
turned
round
toward
her
for
heaven
s
sake
she
said
with
peculiar
eagerness
go
to
the
piano
and
play
madame
de
bellegarde
held
up
her
tapestry
and
pointed
to
a
little
white
flower
don
t
ask
me
to
leave
this
i
am
in
the
midst
of
a
masterpiece
my
flower
is
going
to
smell
very
sweet
i
am
putting
in
the
smell
with
this
silk
i
am
holding
my
breath
i
can
t
leave
off
play
something
it
is
absurd
for
me
to
play
when
you
are
present
said
madame
de
cintré
but
the
next
moment
she
went
to
the
piano
and
began
to
strike
the
keys
with
vehemence
she
played
for
some
time
rapidly
and
brilliantly
when
she
stopped
newman
went
to
the
piano
and
asked
her
to
begin
again
she
shook
her
head
and
on
his
insisting
she
said
i
have
not
been
playing
for
you
i
have
been
playing
for
she
went
back
to
the
window
again
and
looked
out
and
shortly
afterwards
left
the
room
when
newman
took
leave
urbain
de
bellegarde
accompanied
him
as
he
always
did
just
three
steps
down
the
staircase
at
the
bottom
stood
a
servant
with
his
overcoat
he
had
just
put
it
on
when
he
saw
madame
de
cintré
coming
towards
him
across
the
vestibule
shall
you
be
at
home
on
friday
newman
asked
she
looked
at
him
a
moment
before
answering
his
question
you
don
t
like
my
mother
and
my
brother
she
said
he
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
he
said
softly
she
laid
her
hand
on
the
balustrade
and
prepared
to
ascend
the
stairs
fixing
her
eyes
on
the
first
step
yes
i
shall
be
at
home
on
friday
and
she
passed
up
the
wide
dusky
staircase
on
the
friday
as
soon
as
he
came
in
she
asked
him
to
please
to
tell
her
why
he
disliked
her
family
dislike
your
family
he
exclaimed
that
has
a
horrid
sound
i
didn
t
say
so
did
i
i
didn
t
mean
it
if
i
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
what
you
think
of
them
said
madame
de
cintré
i
don
t
think
of
any
of
them
but
that
is
because
you
dislike
them
speak
the
truth
you
can
t
offend
well
i
don
t
exactly
love
your
brother
said
newman
i
remember
now
but
what
is
the
use
of
my
saying
so
i
had
forgotten
you
are
too
said
madame
de
cintré
gravely
then
as
if
to
avoid
the
appearance
of
inviting
him
to
speak
ill
of
the
marquis
she
turned
away
motioning
him
to
sit
down
but
he
remained
standing
before
her
and
said
presently
what
is
of
much
more
importance
is
that
they
don
t
like
no
they
don
t
she
said
and
don
t
you
think
they
are
wrong
newman
asked
i
don
t
believe
i
am
a
man
to
i
suppose
that
a
man
who
may
be
liked
may
also
be
disliked
and
my
brother
my
mother
she
added
have
not
made
you
angry
yes
you
have
never
shown
so
much
the
yes
so
much
the
better
they
think
they
have
treated
you
very
i
have
no
doubt
they
might
have
handled
me
much
more
roughly
said
newman
i
am
much
obliged
to
them
you
are
generous
said
madame
de
cintré
it
s
a
disagreeable
for
them
you
mean
not
for
for
me
said
madame
de
cintré
not
when
their
sins
are
forgiven
said
newman
they
don
t
think
i
am
as
good
as
they
are
i
do
but
we
shan
t
quarrel
about
i
can
t
even
agree
with
you
without
saying
something
that
has
a
disagreeable
sound
the
presumption
was
against
you
that
you
probably
don
t
newman
sat
down
and
looked
at
her
for
some
time
i
don
t
think
i
really
understand
it
but
when
you
say
it
i
believe
that
s
a
poor
reason
said
madame
de
cintré
smiling
no
it
s
a
very
good
one
you
have
a
high
spirit
a
high
standard
but
with
you
it
s
all
natural
and
unaffected
you
don
t
seem
to
have
stuck
your
head
into
a
vise
as
if
you
were
sitting
for
the
photograph
of
propriety
you
think
of
me
as
a
fellow
who
has
had
no
idea
in
life
but
to
make
money
and
drive
sharp
bargains
that
s
a
fair
description
of
me
but
it
is
not
the
whole
story
a
man
ought
to
care
for
something
else
though
i
don
t
know
exactly
what
i
cared
for
but
i
never
cared
particularly
for
the
money
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
and
it
was
impossible
to
be
idle
i
have
been
very
easy
to
others
and
to
myself
i
have
done
most
of
the
things
that
people
asked
me
i
don
t
mean
rascals
as
regards
your
mother
and
your
brother
newman
added
there
is
only
one
point
upon
which
i
feel
that
i
might
quarrel
with
them
i
don
t
ask
them
to
sing
my
praises
to
you
but
i
ask
them
to
let
you
alone
if
i
thought
they
talked
ill
of
me
to
you
i
should
come
down
upon
they
have
let
me
alone
as
you
say
they
have
not
talked
ill
of
in
that
case
cried
newman
i
declare
they
are
only
too
good
for
this
world
madame
de
cintré
appeared
to
find
something
startling
in
his
exclamation
she
would
perhaps
have
replied
but
at
this
moment
the
door
was
thrown
open
and
urbain
de
bellegarde
stepped
across
the
threshold
he
appeared
surprised
at
finding
newman
but
his
surprise
was
but
a
momentary
shadow
across
the
surface
of
an
unwonted
joviality
newman
had
never
seen
the
marquis
so
exhilarated
his
pale
unlighted
countenance
had
a
sort
of
thin
transfiguration
he
held
open
the
door
for
someone
else
to
enter
and
presently
appeared
old
madame
de
bellegarde
leaning
on
the
arm
of
a
gentleman
whom
newman
had
not
seen
before
he
had
already
risen
and
madame
de
cintré
rose
as
she
always
did
before
her
mother
the
marquis
who
had
greeted
newman
almost
genially
stood
apart
slowly
rubbing
his
hands
his
mother
came
forward
with
her
companion
she
gave
a
majestic
little
nod
at
newman
and
then
she
released
the
strange
gentleman
that
he
might
make
his
bow
to
her
daughter
my
daughter
she
said
i
have
brought
you
an
unknown
relative
lord
deepmere
lord
deepmere
is
our
cousin
but
he
has
done
only
what
he
ought
to
have
done
long
ago
come
to
make
our
madame
de
cintré
smiled
and
offered
lord
deepmere
her
hand
it
is
very
extraordinary
said
this
noble
laggard
but
this
is
the
first
time
that
i
have
ever
been
in
paris
for
more
than
three
or
four
and
how
long
have
you
been
here
now
asked
madame
de
cintré
oh
for
the
last
two
months
said
lord
deepmere
these
two
remarks
might
have
constituted
an
impertinence
but
a
glance
at
lord
deepmere
s
face
would
have
satisfied
you
as
it
apparently
satisfied
madame
de
cintré
that
they
constituted
only
a
when
his
companions
were
seated
newman
who
was
out
of
the
conversation
occupied
himself
with
observing
the
newcomer
observation
however
as
regards
lord
deepmere
s
person
had
no
great
range
he
was
a
small
meagre
man
of
some
three
and
thirty
years
of
age
with
a
bald
head
a
short
nose
and
no
front
teeth
in
the
upper
jaw
he
had
round
candid
blue
eyes
and
several
pimples
on
his
chin
he
was
evidently
very
shy
and
he
laughed
a
great
deal
catching
his
breath
with
an
odd
startling
sound
as
the
most
convenient
imitation
of
repose
his
physiognomy
denoted
great
simplicity
a
certain
amount
of
brutality
and
probable
failure
in
the
past
to
profit
by
rare
educational
advantages
he
remarked
that
paris
was
awfully
jolly
but
that
for
real
entertainment
it
was
nothing
to
dublin
he
even
preferred
dublin
to
london
had
madame
de
cintré
ever
been
to
dublin
they
must
all
come
over
there
some
day
and
he
would
show
them
some
irish
sport
he
always
went
to
ireland
for
the
fishing
and
he
came
to
paris
for
the
new
offenbach
things
they
always
brought
them
out
in
dublin
but
he
couldn
t
wait
he
had
been
nine
times
to
hear
la
pomme
de
paris
madame
de
cintré
leaning
back
with
her
arms
folded
looked
at
lord
deepmere
with
a
more
visibly
puzzled
face
than
she
usually
showed
to
society
madame
de
bellegarde
on
the
other
hand
wore
a
fixed
smile
the
marquis
said
that
among
light
operas
his
favorite
was
the
gazza
ladra
the
marquise
then
began
a
series
of
inquiries
about
the
duke
and
the
cardinal
the
old
countess
and
lady
barbara
after
listening
to
which
and
to
lord
deepmere
s
somewhat
irreverent
responses
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
newman
rose
to
take
his
leave
the
marquis
went
with
him
three
steps
into
the
hall
is
he
irish
asked
newman
nodding
in
the
direction
of
the
visitor
his
mother
was
the
daughter
of
lord
finucane
said
the
marquis
he
has
great
irish
estates
lady
bridget
in
the
complete
absence
of
male
heirs
either
direct
or
collateral
a
most
extraordinary
circumstance
came
in
for
everything
but
lord
deepmere
s
title
is
english
and
his
english
property
is
immense
he
is
a
charming
young
newman
answered
nothing
but
he
detained
the
marquis
as
the
latter
was
beginning
gracefully
to
recede
it
is
a
good
time
for
me
to
thank
you
he
said
for
sticking
so
punctiliously
to
our
bargain
for
doing
so
much
to
help
me
on
with
your
the
marquis
stared
really
i
have
done
nothing
that
i
can
boast
of
he
said
oh
don
t
be
modest
newman
answered
laughing
i
can
t
flatter
myself
that
i
am
doing
so
well
simply
by
my
own
merit
and
thank
your
mother
for
me
too
and
he
turned
away
leaving
de
bellegarde
looking
after
him
chapter
xiv
the
next
time
newman
came
to
the
rue
de
l
université
he
had
the
good
fortune
to
find
madame
de
cintré
alone
he
had
come
with
a
definite
intention
and
he
lost
no
time
in
executing
it
she
wore
moreover
a
look
which
he
eagerly
interpreted
as
expectancy
i
have
been
coming
to
see
you
for
six
months
now
he
said
and
i
have
never
spoken
to
you
a
second
time
of
marriage
that
was
what
you
asked
me
i
obeyed
could
any
man
have
done
better
you
have
acted
with
great
delicacy
said
madame
de
cintré
well
i
m
going
to
change
now
said
newman
i
don
t
mean
that
i
am
going
to
be
indelicate
but
i
m
going
to
go
back
to
where
i
began
i
back
there
i
have
been
all
round
the
circle
or
rather
i
have
never
been
away
from
here
i
have
never
ceased
to
want
what
i
wanted
then
only
now
i
am
more
sure
of
it
if
possible
i
am
more
sure
of
myself
and
more
sure
of
you
i
know
you
better
though
i
don
t
know
anything
i
didn
t
believe
three
months
ago
you
are
everything
you
are
beyond
everything
i
can
imagine
or
desire
you
know
me
now
you
know
me
i
won
t
say
that
you
have
seen
the
best
but
you
have
seen
the
worst
i
hope
you
have
been
thinking
all
this
while
you
must
have
seen
that
i
was
only
waiting
you
can
t
suppose
that
i
was
changing
what
will
you
say
to
me
now
say
that
everything
is
clear
and
reasonable
and
that
i
have
been
very
patient
and
considerate
and
deserve
my
reward
and
then
give
me
your
hand
madame
de
cintré
do
that
do
i
knew
you
were
only
waiting
she
said
and
i
was
very
sure
this
day
would
come
i
have
thought
about
it
a
great
deal
at
first
i
was
half
afraid
of
it
but
i
am
not
afraid
of
it
she
paused
a
moment
and
then
she
added
it
s
a
she
was
sitting
on
a
low
chair
and
newman
was
on
an
ottoman
near
her
he
leaned
a
little
and
took
her
hand
which
for
an
instant
she
let
him
keep
that
means
that
i
have
not
waited
for
nothing
he
said
she
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
and
he
saw
her
eyes
fill
with
tears
with
me
he
went
on
you
will
be
as
safe
as
safe
and
even
in
his
ardor
he
hesitated
a
moment
for
a
comparison
as
safe
he
said
with
a
kind
of
simple
solemnity
as
in
your
father
s
still
she
looked
at
him
and
her
tears
increased
then
abruptly
she
buried
her
face
on
the
cushioned
arm
of
the
sofa
beside
her
chair
and
broke
into
noiseless
sobs
i
am
weak
i
am
weak
he
heard
her
say
all
the
more
reason
why
you
should
give
yourself
up
to
me
he
answered
why
are
you
troubled
there
is
nothing
but
happiness
is
that
so
hard
to
believe
to
you
everything
seems
so
simple
she
said
raising
her
head
but
things
are
not
so
i
like
you
extremely
i
liked
you
six
months
ago
and
now
i
am
sure
of
it
as
you
say
you
are
sure
but
it
is
not
easy
simply
for
that
to
decide
to
marry
you
there
are
a
great
many
things
to
think
there
ought
to
be
only
one
thing
to
think
about
that
we
love
each
other
said
newman
and
as
she
remained
silent
he
quickly
added
very
good
if
you
can
t
accept
that
don
t
tell
me
i
should
be
very
glad
to
think
of
nothing
she
said
at
last
not
to
think
at
all
only
to
shut
both
my
eyes
and
give
myself
up
but
i
can
t
i
m
cold
i
m
old
i
m
a
coward
i
never
supposed
i
should
marry
again
and
it
seems
to
me
very
strange
i
should
ever
have
listened
to
you
when
i
used
to
think
as
a
girl
of
what
i
should
do
if
i
were
to
marry
freely
by
my
own
choice
i
thought
of
a
very
different
man
from
that
s
nothing
against
me
said
newman
with
an
immense
smile
your
taste
was
not
his
smile
made
madame
de
cintré
smile
have
you
formed
it
she
asked
and
then
she
said
in
a
different
tone
where
do
you
wish
to
live
anywhere
in
the
wide
world
you
like
we
can
easily
settle
i
don
t
know
why
i
ask
you
she
presently
continued
i
care
very
little
i
think
if
i
were
to
marry
you
i
could
live
almost
anywhere
you
have
some
false
ideas
about
me
you
think
that
i
need
a
great
many
things
that
i
must
have
a
brilliant
worldly
life
i
am
sure
you
are
prepared
to
take
a
great
deal
of
trouble
to
give
me
such
things
but
that
is
very
arbitrary
i
have
done
nothing
to
prove
she
paused
again
looking
at
him
and
her
mingled
sound
and
silence
were
so
sweet
to
him
that
he
had
no
wish
to
hurry
her
any
more
than
he
would
have
had
a
wish
to
hurry
a
golden
sunrise
your
being
so
different
which
at
first
seemed
a
difficulty
a
trouble
began
one
day
to
seem
to
me
a
pleasure
a
great
pleasure
i
was
glad
you
were
different
and
yet
if
i
had
said
so
no
one
would
have
understood
me
i
don
t
mean
simply
to
my
they
would
have
said
i
was
a
queer
monster
eh
said
newman
they
would
have
said
i
could
never
be
happy
with
you
you
were
too
different
and
i
would
have
said
it
was
just
you
were
so
different
that
i
might
be
happy
but
they
would
have
given
better
reasons
than
i
my
only
reason
and
she
paused
again
but
this
time
in
the
midst
of
his
golden
sunrise
newman
felt
the
impulse
to
grasp
at
a
rosy
cloud
your
only
reason
is
that
you
love
me
he
murmured
with
an
eloquent
gesture
and
for
want
of
a
better
reason
madame
de
cintré
reconciled
herself
to
this
one
newman
came
back
the
next
day
and
in
the
vestibule
as
he
entered
the
house
he
encountered
his
friend
mrs
bread
she
was
wandering
about
in
honorable
idleness
and
when
his
eyes
fell
upon
her
she
delivered
him
one
of
her
curtsies
then
turning
to
the
servant
who
had
admitted
him
she
said
with
the
combined
majesty
of
her
native
superiority
and
of
a
rugged
english
accent
you
may
retire
i
will
have
the
honor
of
conducting
in
spite
of
this
combination
however
it
appeared
to
newman
that
her
voice
had
a
slight
quaver
as
if
the
tone
of
command
were
not
habitual
to
it
the
man
gave
her
an
impertinent
stare
but
he
walked
slowly
away
and
she
led
newman
upstairs
at
half
its
course
the
staircase
gave
a
bend
forming
a
little
platform
in
the
angle
of
the
wall
stood
an
indifferent
statue
of
an
nymph
simpering
sallow
and
cracked
here
mrs
bread
stopped
and
looked
with
shy
kindness
at
her
companion
i
know
the
good
news
sir
she
murmured
you
have
a
good
right
to
be
first
to
know
it
said
newman
you
have
taken
such
a
friendly
mrs
bread
turned
away
and
began
to
blow
the
dust
off
the
statue
as
if
this
might
be
mockery
i
suppose
you
want
to
congratulate
me
said
newman
i
am
greatly
and
then
he
added
you
gave
me
much
pleasure
the
other
she
turned
around
apparently
reassured
you
are
not
to
think
that
i
have
been
told
anything
she
said
i
have
only
guessed
but
when
i
looked
at
you
as
you
came
in
i
was
sure
i
had
guessed
you
are
very
sharp
said
newman
i
am
sure
that
in
your
quiet
way
you
see
i
am
not
a
fool
sir
thank
god
i
have
guessed
something
else
beside
said
mrs
bread
what
s
that
i
needn
t
tell
you
that
sir
i
don
t
think
you
would
believe
it
at
any
rate
it
wouldn
t
please
oh
tell
me
nothing
but
what
will
please
me
laughed
newman
that
is
the
way
you
well
sir
i
suppose
you
won
t
be
vexed
to
hear
that
the
sooner
everything
is
over
the
the
sooner
we
are
married
you
mean
the
better
for
me
the
better
for
the
better
for
you
perhaps
you
know
you
are
coming
to
live
with
us
said
newman
i
m
extremely
obliged
to
you
sir
but
it
is
not
of
myself
i
was
thinking
i
only
wanted
if
i
might
take
the
liberty
to
recommend
you
to
lose
no
whom
are
you
afraid
of
mrs
bread
looked
up
the
staircase
and
then
down
and
then
she
looked
at
the
undusted
nymph
as
if
she
possibly
had
sentient
ears
i
am
afraid
of
everyone
she
said
what
an
uncomfortable
state
of
mind
said
newman
does
everyone
wish
to
prevent
my
marriage
i
am
afraid
of
already
having
said
too
much
mrs
bread
replied
i
won
t
take
it
back
but
i
won
t
say
any
and
she
took
her
way
up
the
staircase
again
and
led
him
into
madame
de
cintré
s
salon
newman
indulged
in
a
brief
and
silent
imprecation
when
he
found
that
madame
de
cintré
was
not
alone
with
her
sat
her
mother
and
in
the
middle
of
the
room
stood
young
madame
de
bellegarde
in
her
bonnet
and
mantle
the
old
marquise
who
was
leaning
back
in
her
chair
with
a
hand
clasping
the
knob
of
each
arm
looked
at
him
fixedly
without
moving
she
seemed
barely
conscious
of
his
greeting
she
appeared
to
be
musing
intently
newman
said
to
himself
that
her
daughter
had
been
announcing
her
engagement
and
that
the
old
lady
found
the
morsel
hard
to
swallow
but
madame
de
cintré
as
she
gave
him
her
hand
gave
him
also
a
look
by
which
she
appeared
to
mean
that
he
should
understand
something
was
it
a
warning
or
a
request
did
she
wish
to
enjoin
speech
or
silence
he
was
puzzled
and
young
madame
de
bellegarde
s
pretty
grin
gave
him
no
information
i
have
not
told
my
mother
said
madame
de
cintré
abruptly
looking
at
him
told
me
what
demanded
the
marquise
you
tell
me
too
little
you
should
tell
me
that
is
what
i
do
said
madame
urbain
with
a
little
laugh
let
tell
your
mother
said
newman
the
old
lady
stared
at
him
again
and
then
turned
to
her
daughter
you
are
going
to
marry
him
she
cried
softly
ma
said
madame
de
cintré
your
daughter
has
consented
to
my
great
happiness
said
newman
and
when
was
this
arrangement
made
asked
madame
de
bellegarde
i
seem
to
be
picking
up
the
news
by
chance
my
suspense
came
to
an
end
yesterday
said
newman
and
how
long
was
mine
to
have
lasted
said
the
marquise
to
her
daughter
she
spoke
without
irritation
with
a
sort
of
cold
noble
displeasure
madame
de
cintré
stood
silent
with
her
eyes
on
the
ground
it
is
over
now
she
said
where
is
my
son
where
is
urbain
asked
the
marquise
send
for
your
brother
and
inform
young
madame
de
bellegarde
laid
her
hand
on
the
he
was
to
make
some
visits
with
me
and
i
was
to
go
and
knock
very
softly
very
softly
at
the
door
of
his
study
but
he
can
come
to
me
she
pulled
the
bell
and
in
a
few
moments
mrs
bread
appeared
with
a
face
of
calm
inquiry
send
for
your
brother
said
the
old
lady
but
newman
felt
an
irresistible
impulse
to
speak
and
to
speak
in
a
certain
way
tell
the
marquis
we
want
him
he
said
to
mrs
bread
who
quietly
retired
young
madame
de
bellegarde
went
to
her
and
embraced
her
then
she
turned
to
newman
with
an
intense
smile
she
is
charming
i
congratulate
i
congratulate
you
sir
said
madame
de
bellegarde
with
extreme
solemnity
my
daughter
is
an
extraordinarily
good
woman
she
may
have
faults
but
i
don
t
know
my
mother
does
not
often
make
jokes
said
madame
de
cintré
but
when
she
does
they
are
she
is
ravishing
the
marquise
urbain
resumed
looking
at
her
with
her
head
on
one
side
yes
i
congratulate
madame
de
cintré
turned
away
and
taking
up
a
piece
of
tapestry
began
to
ply
the
needle
some
minutes
of
silence
elapsed
which
were
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
de
bellegarde
he
came
in
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
gloved
and
was
followed
by
his
brother
valentin
who
appeared
to
have
just
entered
the
house
de
bellegarde
looked
around
the
circle
and
greeted
newman
with
his
usual
courtesy
valentin
saluted
his
mother
and
his
sisters
and
as
he
shook
hands
with
newman
gave
him
a
glance
of
acute
interrogation
donc
messieurs
cried
young
madame
de
bellegarde
we
have
great
news
for
speak
to
your
brother
my
daughter
said
the
old
lady
madame
de
cintré
had
been
looking
at
her
tapestry
she
raised
her
eyes
to
her
brother
i
have
accepted
your
sister
has
consented
said
newman
you
see
after
all
i
knew
what
i
was
i
am
charmed
said
de
bellegarde
with
superior
benignity
so
am
i
said
valentin
to
newman
the
marquis
and
i
are
charmed
i
can
t
marry
myself
but
i
can
understand
it
i
can
t
stand
on
my
head
but
i
can
applaud
a
clever
acrobat
my
dear
sister
i
bless
your
the
marquis
stood
looking
for
a
while
into
the
crown
of
his
hat
we
have
been
prepared
he
said
at
last
but
it
is
inevitable
that
in
face
of
the
event
one
should
experience
a
certain
and
he
gave
a
most
unhilarious
smile
i
feel
no
emotion
that
i
was
not
perfectly
prepared
for
said
his
mother
i
can
t
say
that
for
myself
said
newman
smiling
but
differently
from
the
marquis
i
am
happier
than
i
expected
to
be
i
suppose
it
s
the
sight
of
your
happiness
don
t
exaggerate
that
said
madame
de
bellegarde
getting
up
and
laying
her
hand
upon
her
daughter
s
arm
you
can
t
expect
an
honest
old
woman
to
thank
you
for
taking
away
her
beautiful
only
you
forgot
me
dear
madame
said
the
young
marquise
demurely
yes
she
is
very
beautiful
said
newman
and
when
is
the
wedding
pray
asked
young
madame
de
bellegarde
i
must
have
a
month
to
think
over
a
that
must
be
discussed
said
the
marquise
oh
we
will
discuss
it
and
let
you
know
newman
exclaimed
i
have
no
doubt
we
shall
agree
said
urbain
if
you
don
t
agree
with
madame
de
cintré
you
will
be
very
come
come
urbain
said
young
madame
de
bellegarde
i
must
go
straight
to
my
tailor
the
old
lady
had
been
standing
with
her
hand
on
her
daughter
s
arm
looking
at
her
fixedly
she
gave
a
little
sigh
and
murmured
no
i
did
expect
it
you
are
a
fortunate
man
she
added
turning
to
newman
with
an
expressive
nod
oh
i
know
that
he
answered
i
feel
tremendously
proud
i
feel
like
crying
it
on
the
housetops
like
stopping
people
in
the
street
to
tell
madame
de
bellegarde
narrowed
her
lips
pray
don
t
she
said
the
more
people
that
know
it
the
better
newman
declared
i
haven
t
yet
announced
it
here
but
i
telegraphed
it
this
morning
to
telegraphed
it
to
america
the
old
lady
murmured
to
new
york
to
louis
and
to
san
francisco
those
are
the
principal
cities
you
know
i
shall
tell
my
friends
have
you
many
asked
madame
de
bellegarde
in
a
tone
of
which
i
am
afraid
that
newman
but
partly
measured
the
impertinence
enough
to
bring
me
a
great
many
and
congratulations
to
say
nothing
he
added
in
a
moment
of
those
i
shall
receive
from
your
they
will
not
use
the
telegraph
said
the
marquise
taking
her
departure
de
bellegarde
whose
wife
her
imagination
having
apparently
taken
flight
to
the
tailor
s
was
fluttering
her
silken
wings
in
emulation
shook
hands
with
newman
and
said
with
a
more
persuasive
accent
than
the
latter
had
ever
heard
him
use
you
may
count
upon
then
his
wife
led
him
away
valentin
stood
looking
from
his
sister
to
our
hero
i
hope
you
both
reflected
seriously
he
said
madame
de
cintré
smiled
we
have
neither
your
powers
of
reflection
nor
your
depth
of
seriousness
but
we
have
done
our
well
i
have
a
great
regard
for
each
of
you
valentin
continued
you
are
charming
young
people
but
i
am
not
satisfied
on
the
whole
that
you
belong
to
that
small
and
superior
class
that
exquisite
group
composed
of
persons
who
are
worthy
to
remain
unmarried
these
are
rare
souls
they
are
the
salt
of
the
earth
but
i
don
t
mean
to
be
invidious
the
marrying
people
are
often
very
valentin
holds
that
women
should
marry
and
that
men
should
not
said
madame
de
cintré
i
don
t
know
how
he
arranges
i
arrange
it
by
adoring
you
my
sister
said
valentin
ardently
adore
someone
whom
you
can
marry
said
newman
i
will
arrange
that
for
you
some
day
i
foresee
that
i
am
going
to
turn
valentin
was
on
the
threshold
he
looked
back
a
moment
with
a
face
that
had
turned
grave
i
adore
someone
i
can
t
marry
he
said
and
he
dropped
the
and
departed
they
don
t
like
it
said
newman
standing
alone
before
madame
de
cintré
no
she
said
after
a
moment
they
don
t
like
well
now
do
you
mind
that
asked
newman
yes
she
said
after
another
interval
that
s
a
i
can
t
help
it
i
should
prefer
that
my
mother
were
why
the
deuce
demanded
newman
is
she
not
pleased
she
gave
you
leave
to
marry
very
true
i
don
t
understand
it
and
yet
i
do
mind
it
as
you
say
you
will
call
it
that
will
depend
upon
how
much
you
let
it
bother
you
then
i
shall
call
it
an
awful
i
will
keep
it
to
myself
said
madame
de
cintré
it
shall
not
bother
and
then
they
talked
of
their
and
madame
de
cintré
assented
unreservedly
to
newman
s
desire
to
have
it
fixed
for
an
early
date
newman
s
telegrams
were
answered
with
interest
having
dispatched
but
three
electric
missives
he
received
no
less
than
eight
gratulatory
bulletins
in
return
he
put
them
into
his
and
the
next
time
he
encountered
old
madame
de
bellegarde
drew
them
forth
and
displayed
them
to
her
this
it
must
be
confessed
was
a
slightly
malicious
stroke
the
reader
must
judge
in
what
degree
the
offense
was
venial
newman
knew
that
the
marquise
disliked
his
telegrams
though
he
could
see
no
sufficient
reason
for
it
madame
de
cintré
on
the
other
hand
liked
them
and
most
of
them
being
of
a
humorous
cast
laughed
at
them
immoderately
and
inquired
into
the
character
of
their
authors
newman
now
that
his
prize
was
gained
felt
a
peculiar
desire
that
his
triumph
should
be
manifest
he
more
than
suspected
that
the
bellegardes
were
keeping
quiet
about
it
and
allowing
it
in
their
select
circle
but
a
limited
resonance
and
it
pleased
him
to
think
that
if
he
were
to
take
the
trouble
he
might
as
he
phrased
it
break
all
the
windows
no
man
likes
being
repudiated
and
yet
newman
if
he
was
not
flattered
was
not
exactly
offended
he
had
not
this
good
excuse
for
his
somewhat
aggressive
impulse
to
promulgate
his
felicity
his
sentiment
was
of
another
quality
he
wanted
for
once
to
make
the
heads
of
the
house
of
bellegarde
him
he
knew
not
when
he
should
have
another
chance
he
had
had
for
the
past
six
months
a
sense
of
the
old
lady
and
her
son
looking
straight
over
his
head
and
he
was
now
resolved
that
they
should
toe
a
mark
which
he
would
give
himself
the
satisfaction
of
drawing
it
is
like
seeing
a
bottle
emptied
when
the
wine
is
poured
too
slowly
he
said
to
tristram
they
make
me
want
to
joggle
their
elbows
and
force
them
to
spill
their
to
this
tristram
answered
that
he
had
better
leave
them
alone
and
let
them
do
things
in
their
own
way
you
must
make
allowances
for
them
she
said
it
is
natural
enough
that
they
should
hang
fire
a
little
they
thought
they
accepted
you
when
you
made
your
application
but
they
are
not
people
of
imagination
they
could
not
project
themselves
into
the
future
and
now
they
will
have
to
begin
again
but
they
people
of
honor
and
they
will
do
whatever
is
newman
spent
a
few
moments
in
meditation
i
am
not
hard
on
them
he
presently
said
and
to
prove
it
i
will
invite
them
all
to
a
to
a
festival
you
have
been
laughing
at
my
great
gilded
rooms
all
winter
i
will
show
you
that
they
are
good
for
something
i
will
give
a
party
what
is
the
grandest
thing
one
can
do
here
i
will
hire
all
the
great
singers
from
the
opera
and
all
the
first
people
from
the
théâtre
français
and
i
will
give
an
and
whom
will
you
invite
you
first
of
all
and
then
the
old
lady
and
her
son
and
then
everyone
among
her
friends
whom
i
have
met
at
her
house
or
elsewhere
everyone
who
has
shown
me
the
minimum
of
politeness
every
duke
of
them
and
his
wife
and
then
all
my
friends
without
exception
miss
kitty
upjohn
miss
dora
finch
general
packard
p
hatch
and
all
the
rest
and
everyone
shall
know
what
it
is
about
that
is
to
celebrate
my
engagement
to
the
countess
de
cintré
what
do
you
think
of
the
idea
i
think
it
is
odious
said
tristram
and
then
in
a
moment
i
think
it
is
delicious
the
very
next
evening
newman
repaired
to
madame
de
bellegarde
s
salon
where
he
found
her
surrounded
by
her
children
and
invited
her
to
honor
his
poor
dwelling
by
her
presence
on
a
certain
evening
a
fortnight
distant
the
marquise
stared
a
moment
my
dear
sir
she
cried
what
do
you
want
to
do
to
me
to
make
you
acquainted
with
a
few
people
and
then
to
place
you
in
a
very
easy
chair
and
ask
you
to
listen
to
madame
frezzolini
s
you
mean
to
give
a
concert
something
of
that
and
to
have
a
crowd
of
people
all
my
friends
and
i
hope
some
of
yours
and
your
daughter
s
i
want
to
celebrate
my
it
seemed
to
newman
that
madame
de
bellegarde
turned
pale
she
opened
her
fan
a
fine
old
painted
fan
of
the
last
century
and
looked
at
the
picture
which
represented
a
a
lady
with
a
guitar
singing
and
a
group
of
dancers
round
a
garlanded
hermes
we
go
out
so
little
murmured
the
marquis
since
my
poor
father
s
but
dear
father
is
still
alive
my
friend
said
his
wife
i
am
only
waiting
for
my
invitation
to
accept
it
and
she
glanced
with
amiable
confidence
at
newman
it
will
be
magnificent
i
am
very
sure
of
i
am
sorry
to
say
to
the
discredit
of
newman
s
gallantry
that
this
lady
s
invitation
was
not
then
and
there
bestowed
he
was
giving
all
his
attention
to
the
old
marquise
she
looked
up
at
last
smiling
i
can
t
think
of
letting
you
offer
me
a
fête
she
said
until
i
have
offered
you
one
we
want
to
present
you
to
our
friends
we
will
invite
them
all
we
have
it
very
much
at
heart
we
must
do
things
in
order
come
to
me
about
the
i
will
let
you
know
the
exact
day
immediately
we
shall
not
have
anyone
so
fine
as
madame
frezzolini
but
we
shall
have
some
very
good
people
after
that
you
may
talk
of
your
own
the
old
lady
spoke
with
a
certain
quick
eagerness
smiling
more
agreeably
as
she
went
on
it
seemed
to
newman
a
handsome
proposal
and
such
proposals
always
touched
the
sources
of
his
he
said
to
madame
de
bellegarde
that
he
should
be
glad
to
come
on
the
or
any
other
day
and
that
it
mattered
very
little
whether
he
met
his
friends
at
her
house
or
at
his
own
i
have
said
that
newman
was
observant
but
it
must
be
admitted
that
on
this
occasion
he
failed
to
notice
a
certain
delicate
glance
which
passed
between
madame
de
bellegarde
and
the
marquis
and
which
we
may
presume
to
have
been
a
commentary
upon
the
innocence
displayed
in
that
latter
clause
of
his
speech
valentin
de
bellegarde
walked
away
with
newman
that
evening
and
when
they
had
left
the
rue
de
l
université
some
distance
behind
them
he
said
reflectively
my
mother
is
very
strong
very
then
in
answer
to
an
interrogative
movement
of
newman
s
he
continued
she
was
driven
to
the
wall
but
you
would
never
have
thought
it
her
fête
of
the
was
an
invention
of
the
moment
she
had
no
idea
whatever
of
giving
a
fête
but
finding
it
the
only
issue
from
your
proposal
she
looked
straight
at
the
dose
excuse
the
expression
and
bolted
it
as
you
saw
without
winking
she
is
very
dear
me
said
newman
divided
between
relish
and
compassion
i
don
t
care
a
straw
for
her
fête
i
am
willing
to
take
the
will
for
the
no
no
said
valentin
with
a
little
inconsequent
touch
of
family
pride
the
thing
will
be
done
now
and
done
chapter
xv
valentin
de
bellegarde
s
announcement
of
the
secession
of
mademoiselle
nioche
from
her
father
s
domicile
and
his
irreverent
reflections
upon
the
attitude
of
this
anxious
parent
in
so
grave
a
catastrophe
received
a
practical
commentary
in
the
fact
that
nioche
was
slow
to
seek
another
interview
with
his
late
pupil
it
had
cost
newman
some
disgust
to
be
forced
to
assent
to
valentin
s
somewhat
cynical
interpretation
of
the
old
man
s
philosophy
and
though
circumstances
seemed
to
indicate
that
he
had
not
given
himself
up
to
a
noble
despair
newman
thought
it
very
possible
he
might
be
suffering
more
keenly
than
was
apparent
nioche
had
been
in
the
habit
of
paying
him
a
respectful
little
visit
every
two
or
three
weeks
and
his
absence
might
be
a
proof
quite
as
much
of
extreme
depression
as
of
a
desire
to
conceal
the
success
with
which
he
had
patched
up
his
sorrow
newman
presently
learned
from
valentin
several
details
touching
this
new
phase
of
mademoiselle
noémie
s
career
i
told
you
she
was
remarkable
this
unshrinking
observer
declared
and
the
way
she
has
managed
this
performance
proves
it
she
has
had
other
chances
but
she
was
resolved
to
take
none
but
the
best
she
did
you
the
honor
to
think
for
a
while
that
you
might
be
such
a
chance
you
were
not
so
she
gathered
up
her
patience
and
waited
a
while
longer
at
last
her
occasion
came
along
and
she
made
her
move
with
her
eyes
wide
open
i
am
very
sure
she
had
no
innocence
to
lose
but
she
had
all
her
respectability
dubious
little
damsel
as
you
thought
her
she
had
kept
a
firm
hold
of
that
nothing
could
be
proved
against
her
and
she
was
determined
not
to
let
her
reputation
go
till
she
had
got
her
equivalent
about
her
equivalent
she
had
high
ideas
apparently
her
ideal
has
been
satisfied
it
is
fifty
years
old
and
deaf
but
it
is
very
easy
about
and
where
in
the
world
asked
newman
did
you
pick
up
this
valuable
information
in
conversation
remember
my
frivolous
habits
in
conversation
with
a
young
woman
engaged
in
the
humble
trade
of
who
keeps
a
small
shop
in
the
rue
roch
nioche
lives
in
the
same
house
up
six
pair
of
stairs
across
the
court
in
and
out
of
whose
doorway
miss
noémie
has
been
flitting
for
the
last
five
years
the
little
was
an
old
acquaintance
she
used
to
be
the
friend
of
a
friend
of
mine
who
has
married
and
dropped
such
friends
i
often
saw
her
in
his
society
as
soon
as
i
espied
her
behind
her
clear
little
i
recollected
her
i
had
on
a
spotlessly
fresh
pair
of
gloves
but
i
went
in
and
held
up
my
hands
and
said
to
her
dear
mademoiselle
what
will
you
ask
me
for
cleaning
these
dear
count
she
answered
immediately
i
will
clean
them
for
you
for
she
had
instantly
recognized
me
and
i
had
to
hear
her
history
for
the
last
six
years
but
after
that
i
put
her
upon
that
of
her
neighbors
she
knows
and
admires
noémie
and
she
told
me
what
i
have
just
a
month
elapsed
without
nioche
reappearing
and
newman
who
every
morning
read
two
or
three
suicides
in
the
began
to
suspect
that
mortification
proving
stubborn
he
had
sought
a
balm
for
his
wounded
pride
in
the
waters
of
the
seine
he
had
a
note
of
nioche
s
address
in
his
and
finding
himself
one
day
in
the
he
determined
in
so
far
as
he
might
to
clear
up
his
doubts
he
repaired
to
the
house
in
the
rue
roch
which
bore
the
recorded
number
and
observed
in
a
neighboring
basement
behind
a
dangling
row
of
neatly
inflated
gloves
the
attentive
physiognomy
of
bellegarde
s
informant
a
sallow
person
in
a
peering
into
the
street
as
if
she
were
expecting
that
amiable
nobleman
to
pass
again
but
it
was
not
to
her
that
newman
applied
he
simply
asked
of
the
portress
if
nioche
were
at
home
the
portress
replied
as
the
portress
invariably
replies
that
her
lodger
had
gone
out
barely
three
minutes
before
but
then
through
the
little
square
hole
of
her
taking
the
measure
of
newman
s
fortunes
and
seeing
them
by
an
unspecified
process
refresh
the
dry
places
of
servitude
to
occupants
of
fifth
floors
on
courts
she
added
that
nioche
would
have
had
just
time
to
reach
the
café
de
la
patrie
round
the
second
corner
to
the
left
at
which
establishment
he
regularly
spent
his
afternoons
newman
thanked
her
for
the
information
took
the
second
turning
to
the
left
and
arrived
at
the
café
de
la
patrie
he
felt
a
momentary
hesitation
to
go
in
was
it
not
rather
mean
to
follow
up
poor
old
nioche
at
that
rate
but
there
passed
across
his
vision
an
image
of
a
haggard
little
septuagenarian
taking
measured
sips
of
a
glass
of
sugar
and
water
and
finding
them
quite
impotent
to
sweeten
his
desolation
he
opened
the
door
and
entered
perceiving
nothing
at
first
but
a
dense
cloud
of
tobacco
smoke
across
this
however
in
a
corner
he
presently
descried
the
figure
of
nioche
stirring
the
contents
of
a
deep
glass
with
a
lady
seated
in
front
of
him
the
lady
s
back
was
turned
to
newman
but
nioche
very
soon
perceived
and
recognized
his
visitor
newman
had
gone
toward
him
and
the
old
man
rose
slowly
gazing
at
him
with
a
more
blighted
expression
even
than
usual
if
you
are
drinking
hot
punch
said
newman
i
suppose
you
are
not
dead
that
s
all
right
don
t
nioche
stood
staring
with
a
fallen
jaw
not
daring
to
put
out
his
hand
the
lady
who
sat
facing
him
turned
round
in
her
place
and
glanced
upward
with
a
spirited
toss
of
her
head
displaying
the
agreeable
features
of
his
daughter
she
looked
at
newman
sharply
to
see
how
he
was
looking
at
her
then
i
don
t
know
what
she
discovered
she
said
graciously
how
d
ye
do
monsieur
won
t
you
come
into
our
little
corner
did
you
come
did
you
come
after
asked
nioche
very
softly
i
went
to
your
house
to
see
what
had
become
of
you
i
thought
you
might
be
sick
said
newman
it
is
very
good
of
you
as
always
said
the
old
man
no
i
am
not
well
yes
i
am
ask
monsieur
to
sit
down
said
mademoiselle
nioche
garçon
bring
a
will
you
do
us
the
honor
to
said
nioche
timorously
and
with
a
double
foreignness
of
accent
newman
said
to
himself
that
he
had
better
see
the
thing
out
and
he
took
a
chair
at
the
end
of
the
table
with
mademoiselle
nioche
on
his
left
and
her
father
on
the
other
side
you
will
take
something
of
course
said
miss
noémie
who
was
sipping
a
glass
of
madeira
newman
said
that
he
believed
not
and
then
she
turned
to
her
papa
with
a
smile
what
an
honor
eh
he
has
come
only
for
nioche
drained
his
pungent
glass
at
a
long
draught
and
looked
out
from
eyes
more
lachrymose
in
consequence
but
you
didn
t
come
for
me
eh
mademoiselle
noémie
went
on
you
didn
t
expect
to
find
me
here
newman
observed
the
change
in
her
appearance
she
was
very
elegant
and
prettier
than
before
she
looked
a
year
or
two
older
and
it
was
noticeable
that
to
the
eye
she
had
only
gained
in
respectability
she
looked
she
was
dressed
in
quiet
colors
and
wore
her
expensively
unobtrusive
toilet
with
a
grace
that
might
have
come
from
years
of
practice
her
present
and
struck
newman
as
really
infernal
and
he
inclined
to
agree
with
valentin
de
bellegarde
that
the
young
lady
was
very
remarkable
no
to
tell
the
truth
i
didn
t
come
for
you
he
said
and
i
didn
t
expect
to
find
you
i
was
told
he
added
in
a
moment
that
you
had
left
your
horreur
cried
mademoiselle
nioche
with
a
smile
does
one
leave
one
s
father
you
have
the
proof
of
the
yes
convincing
proof
said
newman
glancing
at
nioche
the
old
man
caught
his
glance
obliquely
with
his
faded
deprecating
eye
and
then
lifting
his
empty
glass
pretended
to
drink
again
who
told
you
that
noémie
demanded
i
know
very
well
it
was
de
bellegarde
why
don
t
you
say
yes
you
are
not
i
am
embarrassed
said
newman
i
set
you
a
better
example
i
know
de
bellegarde
told
you
he
knows
a
great
deal
about
me
or
he
thinks
he
does
he
has
taken
a
great
deal
of
trouble
to
find
out
but
half
of
it
isn
t
true
in
the
first
place
i
haven
t
left
my
father
i
am
much
too
fond
of
him
isn
t
it
so
little
father
de
bellegarde
is
a
charming
young
man
it
is
impossible
to
be
cleverer
i
know
a
good
deal
about
him
too
you
can
tell
him
that
when
you
next
see
no
said
newman
with
a
sturdy
grin
i
won
t
carry
any
messages
for
just
as
you
please
said
mademoiselle
nioche
i
don
t
depend
upon
you
nor
does
de
bellegarde
either
he
is
very
much
interested
in
me
he
can
be
left
to
his
own
devices
he
is
a
contrast
to
oh
he
is
a
great
contrast
to
me
i
have
no
doubt
said
newman
but
i
don
t
exactly
know
how
you
mean
i
mean
it
in
this
way
first
of
all
he
never
offered
to
help
me
to
a
and
a
and
mademoiselle
nioche
paused
smiling
i
won
t
say
that
is
in
his
favor
for
i
do
you
justice
what
led
you
by
the
way
to
make
me
such
a
queer
offer
you
didn
t
care
for
oh
yes
i
did
said
newman
how
so
it
would
have
given
me
real
pleasure
to
see
you
married
to
a
respectable
young
with
six
thousand
francs
of
income
cried
mademoiselle
nioche
do
you
call
that
caring
for
me
i
m
afraid
you
know
little
about
women
you
were
not
you
were
not
what
you
might
have
newman
flushed
a
trifle
fiercely
come
he
exclaimed
that
s
rather
strong
i
had
no
idea
i
had
been
so
mademoiselle
nioche
smiled
as
she
took
up
her
muff
it
is
something
at
any
rate
to
have
made
you
her
father
had
leaned
both
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
his
head
bent
forward
was
supported
in
his
hands
the
thin
white
fingers
of
which
were
pressed
over
his
ears
in
his
position
he
was
staring
fixedly
at
the
bottom
of
his
empty
glass
and
newman
supposed
he
was
not
hearing
mademoiselle
noémie
buttoned
her
furred
jacket
and
pushed
back
her
chair
casting
a
glance
charged
with
the
consciousness
of
an
expensive
appearance
first
down
over
her
flounces
and
then
up
at
newman
you
had
better
have
remained
an
honest
girl
newman
said
quietly
nioche
continued
to
stare
at
the
bottom
of
his
glass
and
his
daughter
got
up
still
bravely
smiling
you
mean
that
i
look
so
much
like
one
that
s
more
than
most
women
do
nowadays
don
t
judge
me
yet
awhile
she
added
i
mean
to
succeed
that
s
what
i
mean
to
do
i
leave
you
i
don
t
mean
to
be
seen
in
cafés
for
one
thing
i
can
t
think
what
you
want
of
my
poor
father
he
s
very
comfortable
now
it
isn
t
his
fault
either
little
and
she
tapped
the
old
man
on
the
head
with
her
muff
then
she
stopped
a
minute
looking
at
newman
tell
de
bellegarde
when
he
wants
news
of
me
to
come
and
get
it
from
and
she
turned
and
departed
the
waiter
with
a
bow
holding
the
door
wide
open
for
her
nioche
sat
motionless
and
newman
hardly
knew
what
to
say
to
him
the
old
man
looked
dismally
foolish
so
you
determined
not
to
shoot
her
after
all
newman
said
presently
nioche
without
moving
raised
his
eyes
and
gave
him
a
long
peculiar
look
it
seemed
to
confess
everything
and
yet
not
to
ask
for
pity
nor
to
pretend
on
the
other
hand
to
a
rugged
ability
to
do
without
it
it
might
have
expressed
the
state
of
mind
of
an
innocuous
insect
flat
in
shape
and
conscious
of
the
impending
pressure
of
a
and
reflecting
that
he
was
perhaps
too
flat
to
be
crushed
nioche
s
gaze
was
a
profession
of
moral
flatness
you
despise
me
terribly
he
said
in
the
weakest
possible
voice
oh
no
said
newman
it
is
none
of
my
business
it
s
a
good
plan
to
take
things
i
made
you
too
many
fine
speeches
nioche
added
i
meant
them
at
the
i
am
sure
i
am
very
glad
you
didn
t
shoot
her
said
newman
i
was
afraid
you
might
have
shot
yourself
that
is
why
i
came
to
look
you
and
he
began
to
button
his
coat
neither
said
nioche
you
despise
me
and
i
can
t
explain
to
you
i
hoped
i
shouldn
t
see
you
why
that
s
rather
shabby
said
newman
you
shouldn
t
drop
your
friends
that
way
besides
the
last
time
you
came
to
see
me
i
thought
you
particularly
yes
i
remember
said
nioche
musingly
i
was
in
a
fever
i
didn
t
know
what
i
said
what
i
did
it
was
ah
well
you
are
quieter
nioche
was
silent
a
moment
as
quiet
as
the
grave
he
whispered
softly
are
you
very
unhappy
nioche
rubbed
his
forehead
slowly
and
even
pushed
back
his
wig
a
little
looking
askance
at
his
empty
glass
yes
yes
but
that
s
an
old
story
i
have
always
been
unhappy
my
daughter
does
what
she
will
with
me
i
take
what
she
gives
me
good
or
bad
i
have
no
spirit
and
when
you
have
no
spirit
you
must
keep
quiet
i
shan
t
trouble
you
any
well
said
newman
rather
disgusted
at
the
smooth
operation
of
the
old
man
s
philosophy
that
s
as
you
nioche
seemed
to
have
been
prepared
to
be
despised
but
nevertheless
he
made
a
feeble
movement
of
appeal
from
newman
s
faint
praise
after
all
he
said
she
is
my
daughter
and
i
can
still
look
after
her
if
she
will
do
wrong
why
she
will
but
there
are
many
different
paths
there
are
degrees
i
can
give
her
the
benefit
give
her
the
benefit
and
nioche
paused
staring
vaguely
at
newman
who
began
to
suspect
that
his
brain
had
softened
the
benefit
of
my
experience
nioche
added
your
experience
inquired
newman
both
amused
and
amazed
my
experience
of
business
said
nioche
gravely
ah
yes
said
newman
laughing
that
will
be
a
great
advantage
to
her
and
then
he
said
and
offered
the
poor
foolish
old
man
his
hand
nioche
took
it
and
leaned
back
against
the
wall
holding
it
a
moment
and
looking
up
at
him
i
suppose
you
think
my
wits
are
going
he
said
very
likely
i
have
always
a
pain
in
my
head
that
s
why
i
can
t
explain
i
can
t
tell
you
and
she
s
so
strong
she
makes
me
walk
as
she
will
anywhere
but
there
s
this
there
s
and
he
stopped
still
staring
up
at
newman
his
little
white
eyes
expanded
and
glittered
for
a
moment
like
those
of
a
cat
in
the
dark
it
s
not
as
it
seems
i
haven
t
forgiven
her
oh
no
that
s
right
don
t
said
newman
she
s
a
bad
it
s
horrible
it
s
horrible
said
nioche
but
do
you
want
to
know
the
truth
i
hate
her
i
take
what
she
gives
me
and
i
hate
her
more
she
brought
me
three
hundred
francs
they
are
here
in
my
waistcoat
pocket
now
i
hate
her
almost
cruelly
no
i
haven
t
forgiven
why
did
you
accept
the
money
newman
asked
if
i
hadn
t
said
nioche
i
should
have
hated
her
still
more
that
s
what
misery
is
no
i
haven
t
forgiven
take
care
you
don
t
hurt
her
said
newman
laughing
again
and
with
this
he
took
his
leave
as
he
passed
along
the
glazed
side
of
the
café
on
reaching
the
street
he
saw
the
old
man
motioning
the
waiter
with
a
melancholy
gesture
to
replenish
his
glass
one
day
a
week
after
his
visit
to
the
café
de
la
patrie
he
called
upon
valentin
de
bellegarde
and
by
good
fortune
found
him
at
home
newman
spoke
of
his
interview
with
nioche
and
his
daughter
and
said
he
was
afraid
valentin
had
judged
the
old
man
correctly
he
had
found
the
couple
hobnobbing
together
in
all
amity
the
old
gentleman
s
rigor
was
purely
theoretic
newman
confessed
that
he
was
disappointed
he
should
have
expected
to
see
nioche
take
high
ground
high
ground
my
dear
fellow
said
valentin
laughing
there
is
no
high
ground
for
him
to
take
the
only
perceptible
eminence
in
nioche
s
horizon
is
montmartre
which
is
not
an
edifying
quarter
you
can
t
go
mountaineering
in
a
flat
he
remarked
indeed
said
newman
that
he
has
not
forgiven
her
but
she
ll
never
find
it
we
must
do
him
the
justice
to
suppose
he
doesn
t
like
the
thing
valentin
rejoined
mademoiselle
nioche
is
like
the
great
artists
whose
biographies
we
read
who
at
the
beginning
of
their
career
have
suffered
opposition
in
the
domestic
circle
their
vocation
has
not
been
recognized
by
their
families
but
the
world
has
done
it
justice
mademoiselle
nioche
has
a
oh
come
said
newman
impatiently
you
take
the
little
baggage
too
i
know
i
do
but
when
one
has
nothing
to
think
about
one
must
think
of
little
baggages
i
suppose
it
is
better
to
be
serious
about
light
things
than
not
to
be
serious
at
all
this
little
baggage
entertains
oh
she
has
discovered
that
she
knows
you
have
been
hunting
her
up
and
asking
questions
about
her
she
is
very
much
tickled
by
it
that
s
rather
annoying
my
dear
fellow
laughed
valentin
not
the
least
hanged
if
i
should
want
to
have
a
greedy
little
adventuress
like
that
know
i
was
giving
myself
such
pains
about
her
said
newman
a
pretty
woman
is
always
worth
one
s
pains
objected
valentin
mademoiselle
nioche
is
welcome
to
be
tickled
by
my
curiosity
and
to
know
that
i
am
tickled
that
she
is
tickled
she
is
not
so
much
tickled
by
the
you
had
better
go
and
tell
her
newman
rejoined
she
gave
me
a
message
for
you
of
some
such
bless
your
quiet
imagination
said
valentin
i
have
been
to
see
her
three
times
in
five
days
she
is
a
charming
hostess
we
talk
of
shakespeare
and
the
musical
glasses
she
is
extremely
clever
and
a
very
curious
type
not
at
all
coarse
or
wanting
to
be
coarse
determined
not
to
be
she
means
to
take
very
good
care
of
herself
she
is
extremely
perfect
she
is
as
hard
and
as
some
little
figure
of
a
in
an
antique
intaglio
and
i
will
warrant
that
she
has
not
a
grain
more
of
sentiment
or
heart
than
if
she
was
scooped
out
of
a
big
amethyst
you
can
t
scratch
her
even
with
a
diamond
extremely
pretty
really
when
you
know
her
she
is
wonderfully
pretty
intelligent
determined
ambitious
unscrupulous
capable
of
looking
at
a
man
strangled
without
changing
color
she
is
upon
my
honor
extremely
it
s
a
fine
list
of
attractions
said
newman
they
would
serve
as
a
s
description
of
a
favorite
criminal
i
should
sum
them
up
by
another
word
than
why
that
is
just
the
word
to
use
i
don
t
say
she
is
laudable
or
lovable
i
don
t
want
her
as
my
wife
or
my
sister
but
she
is
a
very
curious
and
ingenious
piece
of
machinery
i
like
to
see
it
in
well
i
have
seen
some
very
curious
machines
too
said
newman
and
once
in
a
needle
factory
i
saw
a
gentleman
from
the
city
who
had
stopped
too
near
one
of
them
picked
up
as
neatly
as
if
he
had
been
prodded
by
a
fork
swallowed
down
straight
and
ground
into
small
his
domicile
late
in
the
evening
three
days
after
madame
de
bellegarde
had
made
her
bargain
with
him
the
expression
is
sufficiently
correct
touching
the
entertainment
at
which
she
was
to
present
him
to
the
world
he
found
on
his
table
a
card
of
goodly
dimensions
bearing
an
announcement
that
this
lady
would
be
at
home
on
the
of
the
month
at
ten
o
clock
in
the
evening
he
stuck
it
into
the
frame
of
his
mirror
and
eyed
it
with
some
complacency
it
seemed
an
agreeable
emblem
of
triumph
documentary
evidence
that
his
prize
was
gained
stretched
out
in
a
chair
he
was
looking
at
it
lovingly
when
valentin
de
bellegarde
was
shown
into
the
room
valentin
s
glance
presently
followed
the
direction
of
newman
s
and
he
perceived
his
mother
s
invitation
and
what
have
they
put
into
the
corner
he
asked
not
the
customary
music
dancing
or
tableaux
vivants
they
ought
at
least
to
put
an
oh
there
are
to
be
several
of
us
said
newman
mrs
tristram
told
me
that
she
had
received
a
card
and
sent
an
ah
then
with
tristram
and
her
husband
you
will
have
support
my
mother
might
have
put
on
her
card
three
but
i
suspect
you
will
not
lack
amusement
you
will
see
a
great
many
of
the
best
people
in
france
i
mean
the
long
pedigrees
and
the
high
noses
and
all
that
some
of
them
are
awful
idiots
i
advise
you
to
take
them
up
oh
i
guess
i
shall
like
them
said
newman
i
am
prepared
to
like
every
one
and
everything
in
these
days
i
am
in
high
valentin
looked
at
him
a
moment
in
silence
and
then
dropped
himself
into
a
chair
with
an
unwonted
air
of
weariness
happy
man
he
said
with
a
sigh
take
care
you
don
t
become
if
anyone
chooses
to
take
offense
he
may
i
have
a
good
conscience
said
newman
so
you
are
really
in
love
with
my
yes
sir
said
newman
after
a
pause
and
she
also
i
guess
she
likes
me
said
newman
what
is
the
witchcraft
you
have
used
valentin
asked
how
do
make
love
oh
i
haven
t
any
general
rules
said
newman
in
any
way
that
seems
i
suspect
that
if
one
knew
it
said
valentin
laughing
you
are
a
terrible
customer
you
walk
in
there
is
something
the
matter
with
you
newman
said
in
response
to
this
you
are
vicious
spare
me
all
discordant
sounds
until
after
my
marriage
then
when
i
have
settled
down
for
life
i
shall
be
better
able
to
take
things
as
they
and
when
does
your
marriage
take
place
about
six
weeks
valentin
was
silent
a
while
and
then
he
said
and
you
feel
very
confident
about
the
future
confident
i
knew
what
i
wanted
exactly
and
i
know
what
i
have
you
are
sure
you
are
going
to
be
happy
sure
said
newman
so
foolish
a
question
deserves
a
foolish
answer
yes
you
are
not
afraid
of
anything
what
should
i
be
afraid
of
you
can
t
hurt
me
unless
you
kill
me
by
some
violent
means
that
i
should
indeed
consider
a
tremendous
sell
i
want
to
live
and
i
mean
to
live
i
can
t
die
of
illness
i
am
too
ridiculously
tough
and
the
time
for
dying
of
old
age
won
t
come
round
yet
a
while
i
can
t
lose
my
wife
i
shall
take
too
good
care
of
her
i
may
lose
my
money
or
a
large
part
of
it
but
that
won
t
matter
for
i
shall
make
twice
as
much
again
so
what
have
i
to
be
afraid
of
you
are
not
afraid
it
may
be
rather
a
mistake
for
an
american
man
of
business
to
marry
a
french
countess
for
the
countess
possibly
but
not
for
the
man
of
business
if
you
mean
me
but
my
countess
shall
not
be
disappointed
i
answer
for
her
happiness
and
as
if
he
felt
the
impulse
to
celebrate
his
happy
certitude
by
a
bonfire
he
got
up
to
throw
a
couple
of
logs
upon
the
already
blazing
hearth
valentin
watched
for
a
few
moments
the
quickened
flame
and
then
with
his
head
leaning
on
his
hand
gave
a
melancholy
sigh
got
a
headache
newman
asked
suis
said
valentin
with
gallic
simplicity
you
are
sad
eh
it
is
about
the
lady
you
said
the
other
night
that
you
adored
and
that
you
couldn
t
marry
did
i
really
say
that
it
seemed
to
me
afterwards
that
the
words
had
escaped
me
before
claire
it
was
bad
taste
but
i
felt
gloomy
as
i
spoke
and
i
feel
gloomy
still
why
did
you
ever
introduce
me
to
that
girl
oh
it
s
noémie
is
it
lord
deliver
us
you
don
t
mean
to
say
you
are
lovesick
about
her
lovesick
no
it
s
not
a
grand
passion
but
the
little
demon
sticks
in
my
thoughts
she
has
bitten
me
with
those
even
little
teeth
of
hers
i
feel
as
if
i
might
turn
rabid
and
do
something
crazy
in
consequence
it
s
very
low
it
s
disgustingly
low
she
s
the
most
mercenary
little
jade
in
europe
yet
she
really
affects
my
peace
of
mind
she
is
always
running
in
my
head
it
s
a
striking
contrast
to
your
noble
and
virtuous
attachment
a
vile
contrast
it
is
rather
pitiful
that
it
should
be
the
best
i
am
able
to
do
for
myself
at
my
present
respectable
age
i
am
a
nice
young
man
eh
somme
you
can
t
warrant
my
future
as
you
do
your
drop
that
girl
short
said
newman
don
t
go
near
her
again
and
your
future
will
do
come
over
to
america
and
i
will
get
you
a
place
in
a
it
is
easy
to
say
drop
her
said
valentin
with
a
light
laugh
you
can
t
drop
a
pretty
woman
like
that
one
must
be
polite
even
with
noémie
besides
i
ll
not
have
her
suppose
i
am
afraid
of
so
between
politeness
and
vanity
you
will
get
deeper
into
the
mud
keep
them
both
for
something
better
remember
too
that
i
didn
t
want
to
introduce
you
to
her
you
insisted
i
had
a
sort
of
uneasy
feeling
about
oh
i
don
t
reproach
you
said
valentin
heaven
forbid
i
wouldn
t
for
the
world
have
missed
knowing
her
she
is
really
extraordinary
the
way
she
has
already
spread
her
wings
is
amazing
i
don
t
know
when
a
woman
has
amused
me
more
but
excuse
me
he
added
in
an
instant
she
doesn
t
amuse
you
at
second
hand
and
the
subject
is
an
impure
one
let
us
talk
of
something
valentin
introduced
another
topic
but
within
five
minutes
newman
observed
that
by
a
bold
transition
he
had
reverted
to
mademoiselle
nioche
and
was
giving
pictures
of
her
manners
and
quoting
specimens
of
her
these
were
very
witty
and
for
a
young
woman
who
six
months
before
had
been
painting
the
most
artless
madonnas
startlingly
cynical
but
at
last
abruptly
he
stopped
became
thoughtful
and
for
some
time
afterwards
said
nothing
when
he
rose
to
go
it
was
evident
that
his
thoughts
were
still
running
upon
mademoiselle
nioche
yes
she
s
a
frightful
little
monster
he
said
chapter
xvi
the
next
ten
days
were
the
happiest
that
newman
had
ever
known
he
saw
madame
de
cintré
every
day
and
never
saw
either
old
madame
de
bellegarde
or
the
elder
of
his
prospective
madame
de
cintré
at
last
seemed
to
think
it
becoming
to
apologize
for
their
never
being
present
they
are
much
taken
up
she
said
with
doing
the
honors
of
paris
to
lord
there
was
a
smile
in
her
gravity
as
she
made
this
declaration
and
it
deepened
as
she
added
he
is
our
seventh
cousin
you
know
and
blood
is
thicker
than
water
and
then
he
is
so
interesting
and
with
this
she
laughed
newman
met
young
madame
de
bellegarde
two
or
three
times
always
roaming
about
with
graceful
vagueness
as
if
in
search
of
an
unattainable
ideal
of
amusement
she
always
reminded
him
of
a
painted
with
a
crack
in
it
but
he
had
grown
to
have
a
kindly
feeling
for
her
based
on
the
fact
of
her
owing
conjugal
allegiance
to
urbain
de
bellegarde
he
pitied
de
bellegarde
s
wife
especially
since
she
was
a
silly
little
brunette
with
a
suggestion
of
an
unregulated
heart
the
small
marquise
sometimes
looked
at
him
with
an
intensity
too
marked
not
to
be
innocent
for
coquetry
is
more
finely
shaded
she
apparently
wanted
to
ask
him
something
or
tell
him
something
he
wondered
what
it
was
but
he
was
shy
of
giving
her
an
opportunity
because
if
her
communication
bore
upon
the
aridity
of
her
matrimonial
lot
he
was
at
a
loss
to
see
how
he
could
help
her
he
had
a
fancy
however
of
her
coming
up
to
him
some
day
and
saying
after
looking
around
behind
her
with
a
little
passionate
hiss
i
know
you
detest
my
husband
let
me
have
the
pleasure
of
assuring
you
for
once
that
you
are
right
pity
a
poor
woman
who
is
married
to
a
in
possessing
however
in
default
of
a
competent
knowledge
of
the
principles
of
etiquette
a
very
downright
sense
of
the
meanness
of
certain
actions
it
seemed
to
him
to
belong
to
his
position
to
keep
on
his
guard
he
was
not
going
to
put
it
into
the
power
of
these
people
to
say
that
in
their
house
he
had
done
anything
unpleasant
as
it
was
madame
de
bellegarde
used
to
give
him
news
of
the
dress
she
meant
to
wear
at
his
wedding
and
which
had
not
yet
in
her
creative
imagination
in
spite
of
many
interviews
with
the
tailor
resolved
itself
into
its
composite
totality
i
told
you
pale
blue
bows
on
the
sleeves
at
the
elbows
she
said
but
i
don
t
see
my
blue
bows
at
all
i
don
t
know
what
has
become
of
them
i
see
pink
a
tender
pink
and
then
i
pass
through
strange
dull
phases
in
which
neither
blue
nor
pink
says
anything
to
me
and
yet
i
must
have
the
have
them
green
or
yellow
said
newman
the
little
marquise
would
cry
green
bows
would
break
your
marriage
your
children
would
be
illegitimate
madame
de
cintré
was
calmly
happy
before
the
world
and
newman
had
the
felicity
of
fancying
that
before
him
when
the
world
was
absent
she
was
almost
agitatedly
happy
she
said
very
tender
things
i
take
no
pleasure
in
you
you
never
give
me
a
chance
to
scold
you
to
correct
you
i
bargained
for
that
i
expected
to
enjoy
it
but
you
won
t
do
anything
dreadful
you
are
dismally
inoffensive
it
is
very
stupid
there
is
no
excitement
for
me
i
might
as
well
be
marrying
someone
i
am
afraid
it
s
the
worst
i
can
do
newman
would
say
in
answer
to
this
kindly
overlook
the
he
assured
her
that
he
at
least
would
never
scold
her
she
was
perfectly
satisfactory
if
you
only
knew
he
said
how
exactly
you
are
what
i
coveted
and
i
am
beginning
to
understand
why
i
coveted
it
the
having
it
makes
all
the
difference
that
i
expected
never
was
a
man
so
pleased
with
his
good
fortune
you
have
been
holding
your
head
for
a
week
past
just
as
i
wanted
my
wife
to
hold
hers
you
say
just
the
things
i
want
her
to
say
you
walk
about
the
room
just
as
i
want
her
to
walk
you
have
just
the
taste
in
dress
that
i
want
her
to
have
in
short
you
come
up
to
the
mark
and
i
can
tell
you
my
mark
was
these
observations
seemed
to
make
madame
de
cintré
rather
grave
at
last
she
said
depend
upon
it
i
don
t
come
up
to
the
mark
your
mark
is
too
high
i
am
not
all
that
you
suppose
i
am
a
much
smaller
affair
she
is
a
magnificent
woman
your
ideal
pray
how
did
she
come
to
such
perfection
she
was
never
anything
else
newman
said
i
really
believe
madame
de
cintré
went
on
that
she
is
better
than
my
own
ideal
do
you
know
that
is
a
very
handsome
compliment
well
sir
i
will
make
her
my
own
tristram
came
to
see
her
dear
claire
after
newman
had
announced
his
engagement
and
she
told
our
hero
the
next
day
that
his
good
fortune
was
simply
absurd
for
the
ridiculous
part
of
it
is
she
said
that
you
are
evidently
going
to
be
as
happy
as
if
you
were
marrying
miss
smith
or
miss
thompson
i
call
it
a
brilliant
match
for
you
but
you
get
brilliancy
without
paying
any
tax
upon
it
those
things
are
usually
a
compromise
but
here
you
have
everything
and
nothing
crowds
anything
else
out
you
will
be
brilliantly
happy
as
newman
thanked
her
for
her
pleasant
encouraging
way
of
saying
things
no
woman
could
encourage
or
discourage
better
tristram
s
way
of
saying
things
was
different
he
had
been
taken
by
his
wife
to
call
upon
madame
de
cintré
and
he
gave
an
account
of
the
expedition
you
don
t
catch
me
giving
an
opinion
on
your
countess
this
time
he
said
i
put
my
foot
in
it
once
that
s
a
d
d
underhand
thing
to
do
by
the
way
coming
round
to
sound
a
fellow
upon
the
woman
you
are
going
to
marry
you
deserve
anything
you
get
then
of
course
you
rush
and
tell
her
and
she
takes
care
to
make
it
pleasant
for
the
poor
spiteful
wretch
the
first
time
he
calls
i
will
do
you
the
justice
to
say
however
that
you
don
t
seem
to
have
told
madame
de
cintré
or
if
you
have
she
s
uncommonly
magnanimous
she
was
very
nice
she
was
tremendously
polite
she
and
lizzie
sat
on
the
sofa
pressing
each
other
s
hands
and
calling
each
other
and
madame
de
cintré
sent
me
with
every
third
word
a
magnificent
smile
as
if
to
give
me
to
understand
that
i
too
was
a
handsome
dear
she
quite
made
up
for
past
neglect
i
assure
you
she
was
very
pleasant
and
sociable
only
in
an
evil
hour
it
came
into
her
head
to
say
that
she
must
present
us
to
her
mother
her
mother
wished
to
know
your
friends
i
didn
t
want
to
know
her
mother
and
i
was
on
the
point
of
telling
lizzie
to
go
in
alone
and
let
me
wait
for
her
outside
but
lizzie
with
her
usual
infernal
ingenuity
guessed
my
purpose
and
reduced
me
by
a
glance
of
her
eye
so
they
marched
off
arm
in
arm
and
i
followed
as
i
could
we
found
the
old
lady
in
her
armchair
twiddling
her
aristocratic
thumbs
she
looked
at
lizzie
from
head
to
foot
but
at
that
game
lizzie
to
do
her
justice
was
a
match
for
her
my
wife
told
her
we
were
great
friends
of
newman
the
marquise
started
a
moment
and
then
said
oh
newman
my
daughter
has
made
up
her
mind
to
marry
a
then
madame
de
cintré
began
to
fondle
lizzie
again
and
said
it
was
this
dear
lady
that
had
planned
the
match
and
brought
them
together
oh
tis
you
i
have
to
thank
for
my
american
the
old
lady
said
to
tristram
it
was
a
very
clever
thought
of
yours
be
sure
of
my
and
then
she
began
to
look
at
me
and
presently
said
pray
are
you
engaged
in
some
species
of
manufacture
i
wanted
to
say
that
i
manufactured
for
old
witches
to
ride
on
but
lizzie
got
in
ahead
of
me
my
husband
madame
la
marquise
she
said
belongs
to
that
unfortunate
class
of
persons
who
have
no
profession
and
no
business
and
do
very
little
good
in
the
to
get
her
poke
at
the
old
woman
she
didn
t
care
where
she
shoved
me
dear
me
said
the
marquise
we
all
have
our
i
am
sorry
mine
compel
me
to
take
leave
of
you
said
lizzie
and
we
bundled
out
again
but
you
have
a
in
all
the
force
of
the
oh
said
newman
my
desires
nothing
better
than
to
let
me
betimes
on
the
evening
of
the
he
went
to
madame
de
bellegarde
s
ball
the
old
house
in
the
rue
de
l
université
looked
strangely
brilliant
in
the
circle
of
light
projected
from
the
outer
gate
a
detachment
of
the
populace
stood
watching
the
carriages
roll
in
the
court
was
illumined
with
flaring
torches
and
the
portico
carpeted
with
crimson
when
newman
arrived
there
were
but
a
few
people
present
the
marquise
and
her
two
daughters
were
at
the
top
of
the
staircase
where
the
sallow
old
nymph
in
the
angle
peeped
out
from
a
bower
of
plants
madame
de
bellegarde
in
purple
and
fine
laces
looked
like
an
old
lady
painted
by
vandyke
madame
de
cintré
was
dressed
in
white
the
old
lady
greeted
newman
with
majestic
formality
and
looking
round
her
called
several
of
the
persons
who
were
standing
near
they
were
elderly
gentlemen
of
what
valentin
de
bellegarde
had
designated
as
the
category
two
or
three
of
them
wore
cordons
and
stars
they
approached
with
measured
alertness
and
the
marquise
said
that
she
wished
to
present
them
to
newman
who
was
going
to
marry
her
daughter
then
she
introduced
successively
three
dukes
three
counts
and
a
baron
these
gentlemen
bowed
and
smiled
most
agreeably
and
newman
indulged
in
a
series
of
impartial
accompanied
by
a
happy
to
make
your
acquaintance
he
looked
at
madame
de
cintré
but
she
was
not
looking
at
him
if
his
personal
had
been
of
a
nature
to
make
him
constantly
refer
to
her
as
the
critic
before
whom
in
company
he
played
his
part
he
might
have
found
it
a
flattering
proof
of
her
confidence
that
he
never
caught
her
eyes
resting
upon
him
it
is
a
reflection
newman
did
not
make
but
we
nevertheless
risk
it
that
in
spite
of
this
circumstance
she
probably
saw
every
movement
of
his
little
finger
young
madame
de
bellegarde
was
dressed
in
an
audacious
toilet
of
crimson
crape
bestrewn
with
huge
silver
moons
thin
crescent
and
full
disks
you
don
t
say
anything
about
my
dress
she
said
to
newman
i
feel
he
answered
as
if
i
were
looking
at
you
through
a
telescope
it
is
very
if
it
is
strange
it
matches
the
occasion
but
i
am
not
a
heavenly
i
never
saw
the
sky
at
midnight
that
particular
shade
of
crimson
said
newman
that
is
my
originality
anyone
could
have
chosen
blue
my
would
have
chosen
a
lovely
shade
of
blue
with
a
dozen
little
delicate
moons
but
i
think
crimson
is
much
more
amusing
and
i
give
my
idea
which
is
moonshine
and
bloodshed
said
newman
a
murder
by
moonlight
laughed
madame
de
bellegarde
what
a
delicious
idea
for
a
toilet
to
make
it
complete
there
is
the
silver
dagger
you
see
stuck
into
my
hair
but
here
comes
lord
deepmere
she
added
in
a
moment
i
must
find
out
what
he
thinks
of
lord
deepmere
came
up
looking
very
red
in
the
face
and
laughing
lord
deepmere
can
t
decide
which
he
prefers
my
or
me
said
madame
de
bellegarde
he
likes
claire
because
she
is
his
cousin
and
me
because
i
am
not
but
he
has
no
right
to
make
love
to
claire
whereas
i
am
perfectly
it
is
very
wrong
to
make
love
to
a
woman
who
is
engaged
but
it
is
very
wrong
not
to
make
love
to
a
woman
who
is
oh
it
s
very
jolly
making
love
to
married
women
said
lord
deepmere
because
they
can
t
ask
you
to
marry
is
that
what
the
others
do
the
spinsters
newman
inquired
oh
dear
yes
said
lord
deepmere
in
england
all
the
girls
ask
a
fellow
to
marry
and
a
fellow
brutally
refuses
said
madame
de
bellegarde
why
really
you
know
a
fellow
can
t
marry
any
girl
that
asks
him
said
his
lordship
your
cousin
won
t
ask
you
she
is
going
to
marry
oh
that
s
a
very
different
thing
laughed
lord
deepmere
you
would
have
accepted
i
suppose
that
makes
me
hope
that
after
all
you
prefer
oh
when
things
are
nice
i
never
prefer
one
to
the
other
said
the
young
englishman
i
take
them
ah
what
a
horror
i
won
t
be
taken
in
that
way
i
must
be
kept
apart
cried
madame
de
bellegarde
mr
newman
is
much
better
he
knows
how
to
choose
oh
he
chooses
as
if
he
were
threading
a
needle
he
prefers
madame
de
cintré
to
any
conceivable
creature
or
well
you
can
t
help
my
being
her
cousin
said
lord
deepmere
to
newman
with
candid
hilarity
oh
no
i
can
t
help
that
said
newman
laughing
back
neither
can
she
and
you
can
t
help
my
dancing
with
her
said
lord
deepmere
with
sturdy
simplicity
i
could
prevent
that
only
by
dancing
with
her
myself
said
newman
but
unfortunately
i
don
t
know
how
to
oh
you
may
dance
without
knowing
how
may
you
not
milord
said
madame
de
bellegarde
but
to
this
lord
deepmere
replied
that
a
fellow
ought
to
know
how
to
dance
if
he
didn
t
want
to
make
an
ass
of
himself
and
at
this
moment
urbain
de
bellegarde
joined
the
group
and
with
his
hands
behind
him
this
is
a
very
splendid
entertainment
said
newman
cheerfully
the
old
house
looks
very
if
are
pleased
we
are
content
said
the
marquis
lifting
his
shoulders
and
bending
them
forward
oh
i
suspect
everyone
is
pleased
said
newman
how
can
they
help
being
pleased
when
the
first
thing
they
see
as
they
come
in
is
your
sister
standing
there
as
beautiful
as
an
angel
yes
she
is
very
beautiful
rejoined
the
marquis
solemnly
but
that
is
not
so
great
a
source
of
satisfaction
to
other
people
naturally
as
to
yes
i
am
satisfied
marquis
i
am
satisfied
said
newman
with
his
protracted
enunciation
and
now
tell
me
he
added
looking
round
who
some
of
your
friends
de
bellegarde
looked
about
him
in
silence
with
his
head
bent
and
his
hand
raised
to
his
lower
lip
which
he
slowly
rubbed
a
stream
of
people
had
been
pouring
into
the
salon
in
which
newman
stood
with
his
host
the
rooms
were
filling
up
and
the
spectacle
had
become
brilliant
it
borrowed
its
splendor
chiefly
from
the
shining
shoulders
and
profuse
jewels
of
the
women
and
from
the
voluminous
elegance
of
their
dresses
there
were
no
uniforms
as
madame
de
bellegarde
s
door
was
inexorably
closed
against
the
myrmidons
of
the
upstart
power
which
then
ruled
the
fortunes
of
france
and
the
great
company
of
smiling
and
chattering
faces
was
not
graced
by
any
very
frequent
suggestions
of
harmonious
beauty
it
is
a
pity
nevertheless
that
newman
had
not
been
a
physiognomist
for
a
great
many
of
the
faces
were
irregularly
agreeable
expressive
and
suggestive
if
the
occasion
had
been
different
they
would
hardly
have
pleased
him
he
would
have
thought
the
women
not
pretty
enough
and
the
men
too
smirking
but
he
was
now
in
a
humor
to
receive
none
but
agreeable
impressions
and
he
looked
no
more
narrowly
than
to
perceive
that
everyone
was
brilliant
and
to
feel
that
the
sun
of
their
brilliancy
was
a
part
of
his
credit
i
will
present
you
to
some
people
said
de
bellegarde
after
a
while
i
will
make
a
point
of
it
in
fact
you
will
allow
me
oh
i
will
shake
hands
with
anyone
you
want
said
newman
your
mother
just
introduced
me
to
half
a
dozen
old
gentlemen
take
care
you
don
t
pick
up
the
same
parties
who
are
the
gentlemen
to
whom
my
mother
presented
you
upon
my
word
i
forgot
them
said
newman
laughing
the
people
here
look
very
much
i
suspect
they
have
not
forgotten
you
said
the
marquis
and
he
began
to
walk
through
the
rooms
newman
to
keep
near
him
in
the
crowd
took
his
arm
after
which
for
some
time
the
marquis
walked
straight
along
in
silence
at
last
reaching
the
farther
end
of
the
suite
of
newman
found
himself
in
the
presence
of
a
lady
of
monstrous
proportions
seated
in
a
very
capacious
armchair
with
several
persons
standing
in
a
semicircle
round
her
this
little
group
had
divided
as
the
marquis
came
up
and
de
bellegarde
stepped
forward
and
stood
for
an
instant
silent
and
obsequious
with
his
hat
raised
to
his
lips
as
newman
had
seen
some
gentlemen
stand
in
churches
as
soon
as
they
entered
their
pews
the
lady
indeed
bore
a
very
fair
likeness
to
a
reverend
effigy
in
some
idolatrous
shrine
she
was
monumentally
stout
and
imperturbably
serene
her
aspect
was
to
newman
almost
formidable
he
had
a
troubled
consciousness
of
a
triple
chin
a
small
piercing
eye
a
vast
expanse
of
uncovered
bosom
a
nodding
and
twinkling
tiara
of
plumes
and
gems
and
an
immense
circumference
of
satin
petticoat
with
her
little
circle
of
beholders
this
remarkable
woman
reminded
him
of
the
fat
lady
at
a
fair
she
fixed
her
small
unwinking
eyes
at
the
dear
duchess
said
the
marquis
let
me
present
you
our
good
friend
newman
of
whom
you
have
heard
us
speak
wishing
to
make
newman
known
to
those
who
are
dear
to
us
i
could
not
possibly
fail
to
begin
with
charmed
dear
friend
charmed
monsieur
said
the
duchess
in
a
voice
which
though
small
and
shrill
was
not
disagreeable
while
newman
executed
his
obeisance
i
came
on
purpose
to
see
monsieur
i
hope
he
appreciates
the
compliment
you
have
only
to
look
at
me
to
do
so
sir
she
continued
sweeping
her
person
with
a
glance
newman
hardly
knew
what
to
say
though
it
seemed
that
to
a
duchess
who
joked
about
her
corpulence
one
might
say
almost
anything
on
hearing
that
the
duchess
had
come
on
purpose
to
see
newman
the
gentlemen
who
surrounded
her
turned
a
little
and
looked
at
him
with
sympathetic
curiosity
the
marquis
with
supernatural
gravity
mentioned
to
him
the
name
of
each
while
the
gentleman
who
bore
it
bowed
they
were
all
what
are
called
in
france
i
wanted
extremely
to
see
you
the
duchess
went
on
est
in
the
first
place
i
am
very
fond
of
the
person
you
are
going
to
marry
she
is
the
most
charming
creature
in
france
mind
you
treat
her
well
or
you
shall
hear
some
news
of
me
but
you
look
as
if
you
were
good
i
am
told
you
are
very
remarkable
i
have
heard
all
sorts
of
extraordinary
things
about
you
are
they
true
i
don
t
know
what
you
can
have
heard
said
newman
oh
you
have
your
we
have
heard
that
you
have
had
a
career
the
most
checkered
the
most
what
is
that
about
your
having
founded
a
city
some
ten
years
ago
in
the
great
west
a
city
which
contains
half
a
million
of
inhabitants
isn
t
it
half
a
million
messieurs
you
are
exclusive
proprietor
of
this
flourishing
settlement
and
are
consequently
fabulously
rich
and
you
would
be
richer
still
if
you
didn
t
grant
lands
and
houses
free
of
rent
to
all
who
will
pledge
themselves
never
to
smoke
cigars
at
this
game
in
three
years
we
are
told
you
are
going
to
be
made
president
of
the
duchess
recited
this
amazing
legend
with
a
smooth
which
gave
the
speech
to
newman
s
mind
the
air
of
being
a
bit
of
amusing
dialogue
in
a
play
delivered
by
a
veteran
comic
actress
before
she
had
ceased
speaking
he
had
burst
into
loud
irrepressible
laughter
dear
duchess
dear
duchess
the
marquis
began
to
murmur
soothingly
two
or
three
persons
came
to
the
door
of
the
room
to
see
who
was
laughing
at
the
duchess
but
the
lady
continued
with
the
soft
serene
assurance
of
a
person
who
as
a
duchess
was
certain
of
being
listened
to
and
as
a
garrulous
woman
was
independent
of
the
pulse
of
her
auditors
but
i
know
you
are
very
remarkable
you
must
be
to
have
endeared
yourself
to
this
good
marquis
and
to
his
admirable
world
they
are
very
exacting
i
myself
am
not
very
sure
at
this
hour
of
really
possessing
it
eh
bellegarde
to
please
you
i
see
one
must
be
an
american
millionaire
but
your
real
triumph
my
dear
sir
is
pleasing
the
countess
she
is
as
difficult
as
a
princess
in
a
fairy
tale
your
success
is
a
miracle
what
is
your
secret
i
don
t
ask
you
to
reveal
it
before
all
these
gentlemen
but
come
and
see
me
some
day
and
give
me
a
specimen
of
your
the
secret
is
with
madame
de
cintré
said
newman
you
must
ask
her
for
it
it
consists
in
her
having
a
great
deal
of
very
pretty
said
the
duchess
that
s
a
very
nice
specimen
to
begin
with
what
bellegarde
are
you
already
taking
monsieur
away
i
have
a
duty
to
perform
dear
friend
said
the
marquis
pointing
to
the
other
groups
ah
for
you
i
know
what
that
means
well
i
have
seen
monsieur
that
is
what
i
wanted
he
can
t
persuade
me
that
he
isn
t
very
clever
as
newman
passed
on
with
his
host
he
asked
who
the
duchess
was
the
greatest
lady
in
france
said
the
marquis
de
bellegarde
then
presented
his
prospective
to
some
twenty
other
persons
of
both
sexes
selected
apparently
for
their
typically
august
character
in
some
cases
this
character
was
written
in
good
round
hand
upon
the
countenance
of
the
wearer
in
others
newman
was
thankful
for
such
help
as
his
companion
s
impressively
brief
intimation
contributed
to
the
discovery
of
it
there
were
large
majestic
men
and
small
demonstrative
men
there
were
ugly
ladies
in
yellow
lace
and
quaint
jewels
and
pretty
ladies
with
white
shoulders
from
which
jewels
and
everything
else
were
absent
everyone
gave
newman
extreme
attention
everyone
smiled
everyone
was
charmed
to
make
his
acquaintance
everyone
looked
at
him
with
that
soft
hardness
of
good
society
which
puts
out
its
hand
but
keeps
its
fingers
closed
over
the
coin
if
the
marquis
was
going
about
as
a
if
the
fiction
of
beauty
and
the
beast
was
supposed
to
have
found
its
the
general
impression
appeared
to
be
that
the
bear
was
a
very
fair
imitation
of
humanity
newman
found
his
reception
among
the
marquis
s
friends
very
pleasant
he
could
not
have
said
more
for
it
it
was
pleasant
to
be
treated
with
so
much
explicit
politeness
it
was
pleasant
to
hear
neatly
turned
civilities
with
a
flavor
of
wit
uttered
from
beneath
moustaches
it
was
pleasant
to
see
clever
frenchwomen
they
all
seemed
clever
turn
their
backs
to
their
partners
to
get
a
good
look
at
the
strange
american
whom
claire
de
cintré
was
to
marry
and
reward
the
object
of
the
exhibition
with
a
charming
smile
at
last
as
he
turned
away
from
a
battery
of
smiles
and
other
amenities
newman
caught
the
eye
of
the
marquis
looking
at
him
heavily
and
thereupon
for
a
single
instant
he
checked
himself
am
i
behaving
like
a
d
d
fool
he
asked
himself
am
i
stepping
about
like
a
terrier
on
his
hind
legs
at
this
moment
he
perceived
tristram
at
the
other
side
of
the
room
and
he
waved
his
hand
in
farewell
to
de
bellegarde
and
made
his
way
toward
her
am
i
holding
my
head
too
high
he
asked
do
i
look
as
if
i
had
the
lower
end
of
a
pulley
fastened
to
my
chin
you
look
like
all
happy
men
very
ridiculous
said
tristram
it
s
the
usual
thing
neither
better
nor
worse
i
have
been
watching
you
for
the
last
ten
minutes
and
i
have
been
watching
de
bellegarde
he
doesn
t
like
the
more
credit
to
him
for
putting
it
through
replied
newman
but
i
shall
be
generous
i
shan
t
trouble
him
any
more
but
i
am
very
happy
i
can
t
stand
still
here
please
to
take
my
arm
and
we
will
go
for
a
he
led
tristram
through
all
the
rooms
there
were
a
great
many
of
them
and
decorated
for
the
occasion
and
filled
with
a
stately
crowd
their
somewhat
tarnished
nobleness
recovered
its
lustre
tristram
looking
about
her
dropped
a
series
of
comments
upon
her
but
newman
made
vague
answers
he
hardly
heard
her
his
thoughts
were
elsewhere
they
were
lost
in
a
cheerful
sense
of
success
of
attainment
and
victory
his
momentary
care
as
to
whether
he
looked
like
a
fool
passed
away
leaving
him
simply
with
a
rich
contentment
he
had
got
what
he
wanted
the
savor
of
success
had
always
been
highly
agreeable
to
him
and
it
had
been
his
fortune
to
know
it
often
but
it
had
never
before
been
so
sweet
been
associated
with
so
much
that
was
brilliant
and
suggestive
and
entertaining
the
lights
the
flowers
the
music
the
crowd
the
splendid
women
the
jewels
the
strangeness
even
of
the
universal
murmur
of
a
clever
foreign
tongue
were
all
a
vivid
symbol
and
assurance
of
his
having
grasped
his
purpose
and
forced
along
his
groove
if
newman
s
smile
was
larger
than
usual
it
was
not
tickled
vanity
that
pulled
the
strings
he
had
no
wish
to
be
shown
with
the
finger
or
to
achieve
a
personal
success
if
he
could
have
looked
down
at
the
scene
invisible
from
a
hole
in
the
roof
he
would
have
enjoyed
it
quite
as
much
it
would
have
spoken
to
him
about
his
own
prosperity
and
deepened
that
easy
feeling
about
life
to
which
sooner
or
later
he
made
all
experience
contribute
just
now
the
cup
seemed
full
it
is
a
very
pretty
party
said
tristram
after
they
had
walked
a
while
i
have
seen
nothing
objectionable
except
my
husband
leaning
against
the
wall
and
talking
to
an
individual
whom
i
suppose
he
takes
for
a
duke
but
whom
i
more
than
suspect
to
be
the
functionary
who
attends
to
the
lamps
do
you
think
you
could
separate
them
knock
over
a
lamp
i
doubt
whether
newman
who
saw
no
harm
in
tristram
s
conversing
with
an
ingenious
mechanic
would
have
complied
with
this
request
but
at
this
moment
valentin
de
bellegarde
drew
near
newman
some
weeks
previously
had
presented
madame
de
cintré
s
youngest
brother
to
tristram
for
whose
merits
valentin
professed
a
discriminating
relish
and
to
whom
he
had
paid
several
visits
did
you
ever
read
keats
s
belle
dame
sans
merci
asked
tristram
you
remind
me
of
the
hero
of
the
ballad
oh
what
can
ail
thee
alone
and
palely
loitering
if
i
am
alone
it
is
because
i
have
been
deprived
of
your
society
said
valentin
besides
it
is
good
manners
for
no
man
except
newman
to
look
happy
this
is
all
to
his
address
it
is
not
for
you
and
me
to
go
before
the
you
promised
me
last
spring
said
newman
to
tristram
that
six
months
from
that
time
i
should
get
into
a
monstrous
rage
it
seems
to
me
the
time
s
up
and
yet
the
nearest
i
can
come
to
doing
anything
rough
now
is
to
offer
you
a
i
told
you
we
should
do
things
grandly
said
valentin
i
don
t
allude
to
the
but
everyone
is
here
and
my
sister
told
me
just
now
that
urbain
had
been
he
s
a
good
fellow
he
s
a
good
fellow
said
newman
i
love
him
as
a
brother
that
reminds
me
that
i
ought
to
go
and
say
something
polite
to
your
let
it
be
something
very
polite
indeed
said
valentin
it
may
be
the
last
time
you
will
feel
so
much
like
it
newman
walked
away
almost
disposed
to
clasp
old
madame
de
bellegarde
round
the
waist
he
passed
through
several
rooms
and
at
last
found
the
old
marquise
in
the
first
saloon
seated
on
a
sofa
with
her
young
kinsman
lord
deepmere
beside
her
the
young
man
looked
somewhat
bored
his
hands
were
thrust
into
his
pockets
and
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
toes
of
his
shoes
his
feet
being
thrust
out
in
front
of
him
madame
de
bellegarde
appeared
to
have
been
talking
to
him
with
some
intensity
and
to
be
waiting
for
an
answer
to
what
she
had
said
or
for
some
sign
of
the
effect
of
her
words
her
hands
were
folded
in
her
lap
and
she
was
looking
at
his
lordship
s
simple
physiognomy
with
an
air
of
politely
suppressed
irritation
lord
deepmere
looked
up
as
newman
approached
met
his
eyes
and
changed
color
i
am
afraid
i
disturb
an
interesting
interview
said
newman
madame
de
bellegarde
rose
and
her
companion
rising
at
the
same
time
she
put
her
hand
into
his
arm
she
answered
nothing
for
an
instant
and
then
as
he
remained
silent
she
said
with
a
smile
it
would
be
polite
for
lord
deepmere
to
say
it
was
very
oh
i
m
not
polite
cried
his
lordship
but
it
madame
de
bellegarde
was
giving
you
some
good
advice
eh
said
newman
toning
you
down
a
little
i
was
giving
him
some
excellent
advice
said
the
marquise
fixing
her
fresh
cold
eyes
upon
our
hero
it
s
for
him
to
take
take
it
sir
take
it
newman
exclaimed
any
advice
the
marquise
gives
you
must
be
good
for
marquise
you
must
speak
from
a
cheerful
comfortable
spirit
and
that
makes
good
advice
you
see
everything
going
on
so
brightly
and
successfully
round
you
your
party
is
magnificent
it
was
a
very
happy
thought
it
is
much
better
than
that
thing
of
mine
would
have
if
you
are
pleased
i
am
satisfied
said
madame
de
bellegarde
my
desire
was
to
please
do
you
want
to
please
me
a
little
more
said
newman
just
drop
our
lordly
friend
i
am
sure
he
wants
to
be
off
and
shake
his
heels
a
little
then
take
my
arm
and
walk
through
the
my
desire
was
to
please
you
the
old
lady
repeated
and
she
liberated
lord
deepmere
newman
rather
wondering
at
her
docility
if
this
young
man
is
wise
she
added
he
will
go
and
find
my
daughter
and
ask
her
to
i
have
been
endorsing
your
advice
said
newman
bending
over
her
and
laughing
i
suppose
i
must
swallow
that
lord
deepmere
wiped
his
forehead
and
departed
and
madame
de
bellegarde
took
newman
s
arm
yes
it
s
a
very
pleasant
sociable
entertainment
the
latter
declared
as
they
proceeded
on
their
circuit
everyone
seems
to
know
everyone
and
to
be
glad
to
see
everyone
the
marquis
has
made
me
acquainted
with
ever
so
many
people
and
i
feel
quite
like
one
of
the
family
it
s
an
occasion
newman
continued
wanting
to
say
something
thoroughly
kind
and
comfortable
that
i
shall
always
remember
and
remember
very
i
think
it
is
an
occasion
that
we
shall
none
of
us
forget
said
the
marquise
with
her
pure
neat
enunciation
people
made
way
for
her
as
she
passed
others
turned
round
and
looked
at
her
and
she
received
a
great
many
greetings
and
pressings
of
the
hand
all
of
which
she
accepted
with
the
most
delicate
dignity
but
though
she
smiled
upon
everyone
she
said
nothing
until
she
reached
the
last
of
the
rooms
where
she
found
her
elder
son
then
this
is
enough
sir
she
declared
with
measured
softness
to
newman
and
turned
to
the
marquis
he
put
out
both
his
hands
and
took
both
hers
drawing
her
to
a
seat
with
an
air
of
the
tenderest
veneration
it
was
a
most
harmonious
family
group
and
newman
discreetly
retired
he
moved
through
the
rooms
for
some
time
longer
circulating
freely
overtopping
most
people
by
his
great
height
renewing
acquaintance
with
some
of
the
groups
to
which
urbain
de
bellegarde
had
presented
him
and
expending
generally
the
surplus
of
his
equanimity
he
continued
to
find
it
all
extremely
agreeable
but
the
most
agreeable
things
have
an
end
and
the
revelry
on
this
occasion
began
to
deepen
to
a
close
the
music
was
sounding
its
ultimate
strains
and
people
were
looking
for
the
marquise
to
make
their
farewells
there
seemed
to
be
some
difficulty
in
finding
her
and
newman
heard
a
report
that
she
had
left
the
ball
feeling
faint
she
has
succumbed
to
the
emotions
of
the
evening
he
heard
a
lady
say
poor
dear
marquise
i
can
imagine
all
that
they
may
have
been
for
her
but
he
learned
immediately
afterwards
that
she
had
recovered
herself
and
was
seated
in
an
armchair
near
the
doorway
receiving
parting
compliments
from
great
ladies
who
insisted
upon
her
not
rising
he
himself
set
out
in
quest
of
madame
de
cintré
he
had
seen
her
move
past
him
many
times
in
the
rapid
circles
of
a
waltz
but
in
accordance
with
her
explicit
instructions
he
had
exchanged
no
words
with
her
since
the
beginning
of
the
evening
the
whole
house
having
been
thrown
open
the
apartments
of
the
were
also
accessible
though
a
smaller
number
of
persons
had
gathered
there
newman
wandered
through
them
observing
a
few
scattered
couples
to
whom
this
comparative
seclusion
appeared
grateful
and
reached
a
small
conservatory
which
opened
into
the
garden
the
end
of
the
conservatory
was
formed
by
a
clear
sheet
of
glass
unmasked
by
plants
and
admitting
the
winter
starlight
so
directly
that
a
person
standing
there
would
seem
to
have
passed
into
the
open
air
two
persons
stood
there
now
a
lady
and
a
gentleman
the
lady
newman
from
within
the
room
and
although
she
had
turned
her
back
to
it
immediately
recognized
as
madame
de
cintré
he
hesitated
as
to
whether
he
would
advance
but
as
he
did
so
she
looked
round
feeling
apparently
that
he
was
there
she
rested
her
eyes
on
him
a
moment
and
then
turned
again
to
her
companion
it
is
almost
a
pity
not
to
tell
newman
she
said
softly
but
in
a
tone
that
newman
could
hear
tell
him
if
you
like
the
gentleman
answered
in
the
voice
of
lord
deepmere
oh
tell
me
by
all
means
said
newman
advancing
lord
deepmere
he
observed
was
very
red
in
the
face
and
he
had
twisted
his
gloves
into
a
tight
cord
as
if
he
had
been
squeezing
them
dry
these
presumably
were
tokens
of
violent
emotion
and
it
seemed
to
newman
that
the
traces
of
corresponding
agitation
were
visible
in
madame
de
cintré
s
face
the
two
had
been
talking
with
much
vivacity
what
i
should
tell
you
is
only
to
my
lord
s
credit
said
madame
de
cintré
smiling
frankly
enough
he
wouldn
t
like
it
any
better
for
that
said
my
lord
with
his
awkward
laugh
come
what
s
the
mystery
newman
demanded
clear
it
up
i
don
t
like
we
must
have
some
things
we
don
t
like
and
go
without
some
we
do
said
the
ruddy
young
nobleman
laughing
still
it
s
to
lord
deepmere
s
credit
but
it
is
not
to
everyone
s
said
madam
de
cintré
so
i
shall
say
nothing
about
it
you
may
be
sure
she
added
and
she
put
out
her
hand
to
the
englishman
who
took
it
half
shyly
half
impetuously
and
now
go
and
dance
she
said
oh
yes
i
feel
awfully
like
dancing
he
answered
i
shall
go
and
get
and
he
walked
away
with
a
gloomy
guffaw
what
has
happened
between
you
newman
asked
i
can
t
tell
you
now
said
madame
de
cintré
nothing
that
need
make
you
has
the
little
englishman
been
trying
to
make
love
to
you
she
hesitated
and
then
she
uttered
a
grave
no
he
s
a
very
honest
little
but
you
are
agitated
something
is
the
nothing
i
repeat
that
need
make
you
unhappy
my
agitation
is
over
some
day
i
will
tell
you
what
it
was
not
now
i
can
t
now
well
i
confess
remarked
newman
i
don
t
want
to
hear
anything
unpleasant
i
am
satisfied
with
everything
most
of
all
with
you
i
have
seen
all
the
ladies
and
talked
with
a
great
many
of
them
but
i
am
satisfied
with
madame
de
cintré
covered
him
for
a
moment
with
her
large
soft
glance
and
then
turned
her
eyes
away
into
the
starry
night
so
they
stood
silent
a
moment
side
by
side
say
you
are
satisfied
with
me
said
newman
he
had
to
wait
a
moment
for
the
answer
but
it
came
at
last
low
yet
distinct
i
am
very
it
was
presently
followed
by
a
few
words
from
another
source
which
made
them
both
turn
round
i
am
sadly
afraid
madame
de
cintré
will
take
a
chill
i
have
ventured
to
bring
a
mrs
bread
stood
there
softly
solicitous
holding
a
white
drapery
in
her
hand
thank
you
said
madame
de
cintré
the
sight
of
those
cold
stars
gives
one
a
sense
of
frost
i
won
t
take
your
shawl
but
we
will
go
back
into
the
she
passed
back
and
newman
followed
her
mrs
bread
standing
respectfully
aside
to
make
way
for
them
newman
paused
an
instant
before
the
old
woman
and
she
glanced
up
at
him
with
a
silent
greeting
oh
yes
he
said
you
must
come
and
live
with
well
then
sir
if
you
will
she
answered
you
have
not
seen
the
last
of
me
chapter
xvii
newman
was
fond
of
music
and
went
often
to
the
opera
a
couple
of
evenings
after
madame
de
bellegarde
s
ball
he
sat
listening
to
don
giovanni
having
in
honor
of
this
work
which
he
had
never
yet
seen
represented
come
to
occupy
his
before
the
rising
of
the
curtain
frequently
he
took
a
large
box
and
invited
a
party
of
his
compatriots
this
was
a
mode
of
recreation
to
which
he
was
much
addicted
he
liked
making
up
parties
of
his
friends
and
conducting
them
to
the
theatre
and
taking
them
to
drive
on
high
drags
or
to
dine
at
remote
restaurants
he
liked
doing
things
which
involved
his
paying
for
people
the
vulgar
truth
is
that
he
enjoyed
treating
them
this
was
not
because
he
was
what
is
called
handling
money
in
public
was
on
the
contrary
positively
disagreeable
to
him
he
had
a
sort
of
personal
modesty
about
it
akin
to
what
he
would
have
felt
about
making
a
toilet
before
spectators
but
just
as
it
was
a
gratification
to
him
to
be
handsomely
dressed
just
so
it
was
a
private
satisfaction
to
him
he
enjoyed
it
very
clandestinely
to
have
interposed
pecuniarily
in
a
scheme
of
pleasure
to
set
a
large
group
of
people
in
motion
and
transport
them
to
a
distance
to
have
special
conveyances
to
charter
and
steamboats
harmonized
with
his
relish
for
bold
processes
and
made
hospitality
seem
more
active
and
more
to
the
purpose
a
few
evenings
before
the
occasion
of
which
i
speak
he
had
invited
several
ladies
and
gentlemen
to
the
opera
to
listen
to
madame
alboni
a
party
which
included
miss
dora
finch
it
befell
however
that
miss
dora
finch
sitting
near
newman
in
the
box
discoursed
brilliantly
not
only
during
the
entr
actes
but
during
many
of
the
finest
portions
of
the
performance
so
that
newman
had
really
come
away
with
an
irritated
sense
that
madame
alboni
had
a
thin
shrill
voice
and
that
her
musical
phrase
was
much
garnished
with
a
laugh
of
the
giggling
order
after
this
he
promised
himself
to
go
for
a
while
to
the
opera
alone
when
the
curtain
had
fallen
upon
the
first
act
of
don
giovanni
he
turned
round
in
his
place
to
observe
the
house
presently
in
one
of
the
boxes
he
perceived
urbain
de
bellegarde
and
his
wife
the
little
marquise
was
sweeping
the
house
very
busily
with
a
glass
and
newman
supposing
that
she
saw
him
determined
to
go
and
bid
her
good
evening
de
bellegarde
was
leaning
against
a
column
motionless
looking
straight
in
front
of
him
with
one
hand
in
the
breast
of
his
white
waistcoat
and
the
other
resting
his
hat
on
his
thigh
newman
was
about
to
leave
his
place
when
he
noticed
in
that
obscure
region
devoted
to
the
small
boxes
which
in
france
are
called
not
inaptly
a
face
which
even
the
dim
light
and
the
distance
could
not
make
wholly
indistinct
it
was
the
face
of
a
young
and
pretty
woman
and
it
was
surmounted
with
a
of
pink
roses
and
diamonds
this
person
was
looking
round
the
house
and
her
fan
was
moving
to
and
fro
with
the
most
practiced
grace
when
she
lowered
it
newman
perceived
a
pair
of
plump
white
shoulders
and
the
edge
of
a
dress
beside
her
very
close
to
the
shoulders
and
talking
apparently
with
an
earnestness
which
it
pleased
her
scantily
to
heed
sat
a
young
man
with
a
red
face
and
a
very
low
a
moment
s
gazing
left
newman
with
no
doubts
the
pretty
young
woman
was
noémie
nioche
he
looked
hard
into
the
depths
of
the
box
thinking
her
father
might
perhaps
be
in
attendance
but
from
what
he
could
see
the
young
man
s
eloquence
had
no
other
auditor
newman
at
last
made
his
way
out
and
in
doing
so
he
passed
beneath
the
of
mademoiselle
noémie
she
saw
him
as
he
approached
and
gave
him
a
nod
and
smile
which
seemed
meant
as
an
assurance
that
she
was
still
a
girl
in
spite
of
her
enviable
rise
in
the
world
newman
passed
into
the
and
walked
through
it
suddenly
he
paused
in
front
of
a
gentleman
seated
on
one
of
the
divans
the
gentleman
s
elbows
were
on
his
knees
he
was
leaning
forward
and
staring
at
the
pavement
lost
apparently
in
meditations
of
a
somewhat
gloomy
cast
but
in
spite
of
his
bent
head
newman
recognized
him
and
in
a
moment
sat
down
beside
him
then
the
gentleman
looked
up
and
displayed
the
expressive
countenance
of
valentin
de
bellegarde
what
in
the
world
are
you
thinking
of
so
hard
asked
newman
a
subject
that
requires
hard
thinking
to
do
it
justice
said
valentin
my
immeasurable
what
is
the
matter
now
the
matter
now
is
that
i
am
a
man
again
and
no
more
a
fool
than
usual
but
i
came
within
an
inch
of
taking
that
girl
you
mean
the
young
lady
below
stairs
in
a
in
a
pink
dress
said
newman
did
you
notice
what
a
brilliant
kind
of
pink
it
was
valentin
inquired
by
way
of
answer
it
makes
her
look
as
white
as
new
white
or
black
as
you
please
but
you
have
stopped
going
to
see
her
oh
bless
you
no
why
should
i
stop
i
have
changed
but
she
hasn
t
said
valentin
i
see
she
is
a
vulgar
little
wretch
after
all
but
she
is
as
amusing
as
ever
and
one
be
well
i
am
glad
she
strikes
you
so
unpleasantly
newman
rejoiced
i
suppose
you
have
swallowed
all
those
fine
words
you
used
about
her
the
other
night
you
compared
her
to
a
sapphire
or
a
topaz
or
an
amethyst
some
precious
stone
what
was
it
i
don
t
remember
said
valentin
it
may
have
been
to
a
carbuncle
but
she
won
t
make
a
fool
of
me
now
she
has
no
real
charm
it
s
an
awfully
low
thing
to
make
a
mistake
about
a
person
of
that
i
congratulate
you
newman
declared
upon
the
scales
having
fallen
from
your
eyes
it
s
a
great
triumph
it
ought
to
make
you
feel
yes
it
makes
me
feel
better
said
valentin
gaily
then
checking
himself
he
looked
askance
at
newman
i
rather
think
you
are
laughing
at
me
if
you
were
not
one
of
the
family
i
would
take
it
oh
no
i
m
not
laughing
any
more
than
i
am
one
of
the
family
you
make
me
feel
badly
you
are
too
clever
a
fellow
you
are
made
of
too
good
stuff
to
spend
your
time
in
ups
and
downs
over
that
class
of
goods
the
idea
of
splitting
hairs
about
miss
nioche
it
seems
to
me
awfully
foolish
you
say
you
have
given
up
taking
her
seriously
but
you
take
her
seriously
so
long
as
you
take
her
at
valentin
turned
round
in
his
place
and
looked
a
while
at
newman
wrinkling
his
forehead
and
rubbing
his
knees
parlez
d
but
she
has
wonderfully
pretty
arms
would
you
believe
i
didn
t
know
it
till
this
evening
but
she
is
a
vulgar
little
wretch
remember
all
the
same
said
newman
yes
the
other
day
she
had
the
bad
taste
to
begin
to
abuse
her
father
to
his
face
in
my
presence
i
shouldn
t
have
expected
it
of
her
it
was
a
disappointment
heigho
why
she
cares
no
more
for
her
father
than
for
her
said
newman
i
discovered
that
the
first
time
i
saw
oh
that
s
another
affair
she
may
think
of
the
poor
old
beggar
what
she
pleases
but
it
was
low
in
her
to
call
him
bad
names
it
quite
threw
me
off
it
was
about
a
frilled
petticoat
that
he
was
to
have
fetched
from
the
s
he
appeared
to
have
neglected
this
graceful
duty
she
almost
boxed
his
ears
he
stood
there
staring
at
her
with
his
little
blank
eyes
and
smoothing
his
old
hat
with
his
at
last
he
turned
round
and
went
out
without
a
word
then
i
told
her
it
was
in
very
bad
taste
to
speak
so
to
one
s
papa
she
said
she
should
be
so
thankful
to
me
if
i
would
mention
it
to
her
whenever
her
taste
was
at
fault
she
had
immense
confidence
in
mine
i
told
her
i
couldn
t
have
the
bother
of
forming
her
manners
i
had
had
an
idea
they
were
already
formed
after
the
best
models
she
had
disappointed
me
but
i
shall
get
over
it
said
valentin
gaily
oh
time
s
a
great
consoler
newman
answered
with
humorous
sobriety
he
was
silent
a
moment
and
then
he
added
in
another
tone
i
wish
you
would
think
of
what
i
said
to
you
the
other
day
come
over
to
america
with
us
and
i
will
put
you
in
the
way
of
doing
some
business
you
have
a
very
good
head
if
you
will
only
use
valentin
made
a
genial
grimace
my
head
is
much
obliged
to
you
do
you
mean
the
place
in
a
bank
there
are
several
places
but
i
suppose
you
would
consider
the
bank
the
most
valentin
burst
into
a
laugh
my
dear
fellow
at
night
all
cats
are
gray
when
one
derogates
there
are
no
newman
answered
nothing
for
a
minute
then
i
think
you
will
find
there
are
degrees
in
success
he
said
with
a
certain
dryness
valentin
had
leaned
forward
again
with
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
he
was
scratching
the
pavement
with
his
stick
at
last
he
said
looking
up
do
you
really
think
i
ought
to
do
something
newman
laid
his
hand
on
his
companion
s
arm
and
looked
at
him
a
moment
through
eyelids
try
it
and
see
you
are
not
good
enough
for
it
but
we
will
stretch
a
do
you
really
think
i
can
make
some
money
i
should
like
to
see
how
it
feels
to
have
a
do
what
i
tell
you
and
you
shall
be
rich
said
newman
think
of
and
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
prepared
to
resume
his
way
to
madame
de
bellegarde
s
box
upon
my
word
i
will
think
of
it
said
valentin
i
will
go
and
listen
to
mozart
another
half
hour
i
can
always
think
better
to
music
and
profoundly
meditate
upon
the
marquis
was
with
his
wife
when
newman
entered
their
box
he
was
bland
remote
and
correct
as
usual
or
as
it
seemed
to
newman
even
more
than
usual
what
do
you
think
of
the
opera
asked
our
hero
what
do
you
think
of
the
don
we
all
know
what
mozart
is
said
the
marquis
our
impressions
don
t
date
from
this
evening
mozart
is
youth
freshness
brilliancy
facility
a
little
too
great
facility
perhaps
but
the
execution
is
here
and
there
deplorably
i
am
very
curious
to
see
how
it
ends
said
newman
you
speak
as
if
it
were
a
in
the
observed
the
marquis
you
have
surely
seen
the
opera
before
never
said
newman
i
am
sure
i
should
have
remembered
it
donna
elvira
reminds
me
of
madame
de
cintré
i
don
t
mean
in
her
circumstances
but
in
the
music
she
it
is
a
very
nice
distinction
laughed
the
marquis
lightly
there
is
no
great
possibility
i
imagine
of
madame
de
cintré
being
not
much
said
newman
but
what
becomes
of
the
don
the
devil
comes
down
or
comes
up
said
madame
de
bellegarde
and
carries
him
off
i
suppose
zerlina
reminds
you
of
i
will
go
to
the
for
a
few
moments
said
the
marquis
and
give
you
a
chance
to
say
that
the
commander
the
man
of
stone
resembles
and
he
passed
out
of
the
box
the
little
marquise
stared
an
instant
at
the
velvet
ledge
of
the
balcony
and
then
murmured
not
a
man
of
stone
a
man
of
newman
had
taken
her
husband
s
empty
chair
she
made
no
protest
and
then
she
turned
suddenly
and
laid
her
closed
fan
upon
his
arm
i
am
very
glad
you
came
in
she
said
i
want
to
ask
you
a
favor
i
wanted
to
do
so
on
thursday
at
my
s
ball
but
you
would
give
me
no
chance
you
were
in
such
very
good
spirits
that
i
thought
you
might
grant
my
little
favor
then
not
that
you
look
particularly
doleful
now
it
is
something
you
must
promise
me
now
is
the
time
to
take
you
after
you
are
married
you
will
be
good
for
nothing
come
promise
i
never
sign
a
paper
without
reading
it
first
said
newman
show
me
your
no
you
must
sign
with
your
eyes
shut
i
will
hold
your
hand
come
before
you
put
your
head
into
the
noose
you
ought
to
be
thankful
to
me
for
giving
you
a
chance
to
do
something
if
it
is
so
amusing
said
newman
it
will
be
in
even
better
season
after
i
am
in
other
words
cried
madame
de
bellegarde
you
will
not
do
it
at
all
you
will
be
afraid
of
your
oh
if
the
thing
is
intrinsically
improper
said
newman
i
won
t
go
into
it
if
it
is
not
i
will
do
it
after
my
you
talk
like
a
treatise
on
logic
and
english
logic
into
the
bargain
exclaimed
madame
de
bellegarde
promise
then
after
you
are
married
after
all
i
shall
enjoy
keeping
you
to
well
then
after
i
am
married
said
newman
serenely
the
little
marquise
hesitated
a
moment
looking
at
him
and
he
wondered
what
was
coming
i
suppose
you
know
what
my
life
is
she
presently
said
i
have
no
pleasure
i
see
nothing
i
do
nothing
i
live
in
paris
as
i
might
live
at
poitiers
my
calls
me
what
is
the
pretty
word
a
accuses
me
of
going
to
places
and
thinks
it
ought
to
be
joy
enough
for
me
to
sit
at
home
and
count
over
my
ancestors
on
my
fingers
but
why
should
i
bother
about
my
ancestors
i
am
sure
they
never
bothered
about
me
i
don
t
propose
to
live
with
a
green
shade
on
my
eyes
i
hold
that
things
were
made
to
look
at
my
husband
you
know
has
principles
and
the
first
on
the
list
is
that
the
tuileries
are
dreadfully
vulgar
if
the
tuileries
are
vulgar
his
principles
are
tiresome
if
i
chose
i
might
have
principles
quite
as
well
as
he
if
they
grew
on
one
s
family
tree
i
should
only
have
to
give
mine
a
shake
to
bring
down
a
shower
of
the
finest
at
any
rate
i
prefer
clever
bonapartes
to
stupid
oh
i
see
you
want
to
go
to
court
said
newman
vaguely
conjecturing
that
she
might
wish
him
to
appeal
to
the
united
states
legation
to
smooth
her
way
to
the
imperial
halls
the
marquise
gave
a
little
sharp
laugh
you
are
a
thousand
miles
away
i
will
take
care
of
the
tuileries
myself
the
day
i
decide
to
go
they
will
be
very
glad
to
have
me
sooner
or
later
i
shall
dance
in
an
imperial
quadrille
i
know
what
you
are
going
to
say
how
will
you
dare
but
i
dare
i
am
afraid
of
my
husband
he
is
soft
smooth
irreproachable
everything
that
you
know
but
i
am
afraid
of
him
horribly
afraid
of
him
and
yet
i
shall
arrive
at
the
tuileries
but
that
will
not
be
this
winter
nor
perhaps
next
and
meantime
i
must
live
for
the
moment
i
want
to
go
somewhere
else
it
s
my
dream
i
want
to
go
to
the
bal
to
the
bal
bullier
repeated
newman
for
whom
the
words
at
first
meant
nothing
the
ball
in
the
latin
quarter
where
the
students
dance
with
their
mistresses
don
t
tell
me
you
have
not
heard
of
oh
yes
said
newman
i
have
heard
of
it
i
remember
now
i
have
even
been
there
and
you
want
to
go
there
it
is
silly
it
is
low
it
is
anything
you
please
but
i
want
to
go
some
of
my
friends
have
been
and
they
say
it
is
awfully
my
friends
go
everywhere
it
is
only
i
who
sit
moping
at
it
seems
to
me
you
are
not
at
home
now
said
newman
and
i
shouldn
t
exactly
say
you
were
i
am
bored
to
death
i
have
been
to
the
opera
twice
a
week
for
the
last
eight
years
whenever
i
ask
for
anything
my
mouth
is
stopped
with
that
pray
madam
haven
t
you
an
opera
box
could
a
woman
of
taste
want
more
in
the
first
place
my
opera
box
was
down
in
my
they
have
to
give
it
to
me
for
instance
i
should
have
preferred
a
thousand
times
to
go
to
the
palais
royal
but
my
husband
won
t
go
to
the
palais
royal
because
the
ladies
of
the
court
go
there
so
much
you
may
imagine
then
whether
he
would
take
me
to
bullier
s
he
says
it
is
a
mere
imitation
and
a
bad
one
of
what
they
do
at
the
princess
kleinfuss
s
but
as
i
don
t
go
to
the
princess
kleinfuss
s
the
next
best
thing
is
to
go
to
bullier
s
it
is
my
dream
at
any
rate
it
s
a
fixed
idea
all
i
ask
of
you
is
to
give
me
your
arm
you
are
less
compromising
than
anyone
else
i
don
t
know
why
but
you
are
i
can
arrange
it
i
shall
risk
something
but
that
is
my
own
affair
besides
fortune
favors
the
bold
don
t
refuse
me
it
is
my
dream
newman
gave
a
loud
laugh
it
seemed
to
him
hardly
worth
while
to
be
the
wife
of
the
marquis
de
bellegarde
a
daughter
of
the
crusaders
heiress
of
six
centuries
of
glories
and
traditions
to
have
centred
one
s
aspirations
upon
the
sight
of
a
couple
of
hundred
young
ladies
kicking
off
young
men
s
hats
it
struck
him
as
a
theme
for
the
moralist
but
he
had
no
time
to
moralize
upon
it
the
curtain
rose
again
de
bellegarde
returned
and
newman
went
back
to
his
seat
he
observed
that
valentin
de
bellegarde
had
taken
his
place
in
the
of
mademoiselle
nioche
behind
this
young
lady
and
her
companion
where
he
was
visible
only
if
one
carefully
looked
for
him
in
the
next
act
newman
met
him
in
the
lobby
and
asked
him
if
he
had
reflected
upon
possible
emigration
if
you
really
meant
to
meditate
he
said
you
might
have
chosen
a
better
place
for
oh
the
place
was
not
bad
said
valentin
i
was
not
thinking
of
that
girl
i
listened
to
the
music
and
without
thinking
of
the
play
or
looking
at
the
stage
i
turned
over
your
proposal
at
first
it
seemed
quite
fantastic
and
then
a
certain
fiddle
in
the
orchestra
i
could
distinguish
it
began
to
say
as
it
scraped
away
why
not
why
not
and
then
in
that
rapid
movement
all
the
fiddles
took
it
up
and
the
conductor
s
stick
seemed
to
beat
it
in
the
air
why
not
why
not
i
m
sure
i
can
t
say
i
don
t
see
why
not
i
don
t
see
why
i
shouldn
t
do
something
it
appears
to
me
really
a
very
bright
idea
this
sort
of
thing
is
certainly
very
stale
and
then
i
could
come
back
with
a
trunk
full
of
dollars
besides
i
might
possibly
find
it
amusing
they
call
me
a
who
knows
but
that
i
might
discover
an
unsuspected
charm
in
it
would
really
have
a
certain
romantic
picturesque
side
it
would
look
well
in
my
biography
it
would
look
as
if
i
were
a
strong
man
a
man
a
man
who
dominated
never
mind
how
it
would
look
said
newman
it
always
looks
well
to
have
half
a
million
of
dollars
there
is
no
reason
why
you
shouldn
t
have
them
if
you
will
mind
what
i
tell
you
i
alone
and
not
talk
to
other
he
passed
his
arm
into
that
of
his
companion
and
the
two
walked
for
some
time
up
and
down
one
of
the
less
frequented
corridors
newman
s
imagination
began
to
glow
with
the
idea
of
converting
his
bright
impracticable
friend
into
a
man
of
business
he
felt
for
the
moment
a
sort
of
spiritual
zeal
the
zeal
of
the
propagandist
its
ardor
was
in
part
the
result
of
that
general
discomfort
which
the
sight
of
all
uninvested
capital
produced
in
him
so
fine
an
intelligence
as
bellegarde
s
ought
to
be
dedicated
to
high
uses
the
highest
uses
known
to
newman
s
experience
were
certain
transcendent
sagacities
in
the
handling
of
railway
stock
and
then
his
zeal
was
quickened
by
his
personal
kindness
for
valentin
he
had
a
sort
of
pity
for
him
which
he
was
well
aware
he
never
could
have
made
the
comte
de
bellegarde
understand
he
never
lost
a
sense
of
its
being
pitiable
that
valentin
should
think
it
a
large
life
to
revolve
in
varnished
boots
between
the
rue
d
anjou
and
the
rue
de
l
université
taking
the
boulevard
des
italiens
on
the
way
when
over
there
in
america
one
s
promenade
was
a
continent
and
one
s
boulevard
stretched
from
new
york
to
san
francisco
it
mortified
him
moreover
to
think
that
valentin
lacked
money
there
was
a
painful
grotesqueness
in
it
it
affected
him
as
the
ignorance
of
a
companion
otherwise
without
reproach
touching
some
rudimentary
branch
of
learning
would
have
done
there
were
things
that
one
knew
about
as
a
matter
of
course
he
would
have
said
in
such
a
case
just
so
if
one
pretended
to
be
easy
in
the
world
one
had
money
as
a
matter
of
course
one
had
made
it
there
was
something
almost
ridiculously
anomalous
to
newman
in
the
sight
of
lively
pretensions
unaccompanied
by
large
investments
in
railroads
though
i
may
add
that
he
would
not
have
maintained
that
such
investments
were
in
themselves
a
proper
ground
for
pretensions
i
will
make
you
do
something
he
said
to
valentin
i
will
put
you
through
i
know
half
a
dozen
things
in
which
we
can
make
a
place
for
you
you
will
see
some
lively
work
it
will
take
you
a
little
while
to
get
used
to
the
life
but
you
will
work
in
before
long
and
at
the
end
of
six
months
after
you
have
done
a
thing
or
two
on
your
own
account
you
will
like
it
and
then
it
will
be
very
pleasant
for
you
having
your
sister
over
there
it
will
be
pleasant
for
her
to
have
you
too
yes
valentin
continued
newman
pressing
his
friend
s
arm
genially
i
think
i
see
just
the
opening
for
you
keep
quiet
and
i
ll
push
you
right
newman
pursued
this
favoring
strain
for
some
time
longer
the
two
men
strolled
about
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
valentin
listened
and
questioned
many
of
his
questions
making
newman
laugh
loud
at
the
of
his
ignorance
of
the
vulgar
processes
of
smiling
himself
too
half
ironical
and
half
curious
and
yet
he
was
serious
he
was
fascinated
by
newman
s
plain
prose
version
of
the
legend
of
el
dorado
it
is
true
however
that
though
to
accept
an
opening
in
an
american
mercantile
house
might
be
a
bold
original
and
in
its
consequences
extremely
agreeable
thing
to
do
he
did
not
quite
see
himself
objectively
doing
it
so
that
when
the
bell
rang
to
indicate
the
close
of
the
entr
acte
there
was
a
certain
in
his
saying
with
his
brilliant
smile
well
then
put
me
through
push
me
in
i
make
myself
over
to
you
dip
me
into
the
pot
and
turn
me
into
they
had
passed
into
the
corridor
which
encircled
the
row
of
and
valentin
stopped
in
front
of
the
dusky
little
box
in
which
mademoiselle
nioche
had
bestowed
herself
laying
his
hand
on
the
doorknob
oh
come
are
you
going
back
there
asked
newman
dieu
said
valentin
haven
t
you
another
place
yes
i
have
my
usual
place
in
the
you
had
better
go
and
occupy
it
i
see
her
very
well
from
there
too
added
valentin
serenely
and
she
is
worth
seeing
but
he
added
in
a
moment
i
have
a
particular
reason
for
going
back
just
oh
i
give
you
up
said
newman
you
are
infatuated
no
it
is
only
this
there
is
a
young
man
in
the
box
whom
i
shall
annoy
by
going
in
and
i
want
to
annoy
i
am
sorry
to
hear
it
said
newman
can
t
you
leave
the
poor
fellow
alone
no
he
has
given
me
cause
the
box
is
not
his
noémie
came
in
alone
and
installed
herself
i
went
and
spoke
to
her
and
in
a
few
moments
she
asked
me
to
go
and
get
her
fan
from
the
pocket
of
her
cloak
which
the
had
carried
off
in
my
absence
this
gentleman
came
in
and
took
the
chair
beside
noémie
in
which
i
had
been
sitting
my
reappearance
disgusted
him
and
he
had
the
grossness
to
show
it
he
came
within
an
ace
of
being
impertinent
i
don
t
know
who
he
is
he
is
some
vulgar
wretch
i
can
t
think
where
she
picks
up
such
acquaintances
he
has
been
drinking
too
but
he
knows
what
he
is
about
just
now
in
the
second
act
he
was
unmannerly
again
i
shall
put
in
another
appearance
for
ten
minutes
time
enough
to
give
him
an
opportunity
to
commit
himself
if
he
feels
inclined
i
really
can
t
let
the
brute
suppose
that
he
is
keeping
me
out
of
the
my
dear
fellow
said
newman
remonstrantly
what
child
s
play
you
are
not
going
to
pick
a
quarrel
about
that
girl
i
that
girl
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
and
i
have
no
intention
of
picking
a
quarrel
i
am
not
a
bully
nor
a
i
simply
wish
to
make
a
point
that
a
gentleman
oh
damn
your
point
said
newman
that
is
the
trouble
with
you
frenchmen
you
must
be
always
making
points
well
he
added
be
short
but
if
you
are
going
in
for
this
kind
of
thing
we
must
ship
you
off
to
america
in
very
good
valentin
answered
whenever
you
please
but
if
i
go
to
america
i
must
not
let
this
gentleman
suppose
that
it
is
to
run
away
from
and
they
separated
at
the
end
of
the
act
newman
observed
that
valentin
was
still
in
the
he
strolled
into
the
corridor
again
expecting
to
meet
him
and
when
he
was
within
a
few
yards
of
mademoiselle
nioche
s
box
saw
his
friend
pass
out
accompanied
by
the
young
man
who
had
been
seated
beside
its
fair
occupant
the
two
gentlemen
walked
with
some
quickness
of
step
to
a
distant
part
of
the
lobby
where
newman
perceived
them
stop
and
stand
talking
the
manner
of
each
was
perfectly
quiet
but
the
stranger
who
looked
flushed
had
begun
to
wipe
his
face
very
emphatically
with
his
by
this
time
newman
was
abreast
of
the
the
door
had
been
left
ajar
and
he
could
see
a
pink
dress
inside
he
immediately
went
in
mademoiselle
nioche
turned
and
greeted
him
with
a
brilliant
smile
ah
you
have
at
last
decided
to
come
and
see
me
she
exclaimed
you
just
save
your
politeness
you
find
me
in
a
fine
moment
sit
there
was
a
very
becoming
little
flush
in
her
cheek
and
her
eye
had
a
noticeable
spark
you
would
have
said
that
she
had
received
some
very
good
news
something
has
happened
here
said
newman
without
sitting
down
you
find
me
in
a
very
fine
moment
she
repeated
two
gentlemen
one
of
them
is
de
bellegarde
the
pleasure
of
whose
acquaintance
i
owe
to
you
have
just
had
words
about
your
humble
servant
very
big
words
too
they
can
t
come
off
without
crossing
swords
a
duel
that
will
give
me
a
push
cried
mademoiselle
noémie
clapping
her
little
hands
est
ça
qui
pose
une
femme
you
don
t
mean
to
say
that
bellegarde
is
going
to
fight
about
exclaimed
newman
disgustedly
nothing
else
and
she
looked
at
him
with
a
hard
little
smile
no
no
you
are
not
and
if
you
prevent
this
affair
i
shall
owe
you
a
grudge
and
pay
my
debt
newman
uttered
an
imprecation
which
though
brief
it
consisted
simply
of
the
interjection
oh
followed
by
a
geographical
or
more
correctly
perhaps
a
theological
noun
in
four
letters
had
better
not
be
transferred
to
these
pages
he
turned
his
back
without
more
ceremony
upon
the
pink
dress
and
went
out
of
the
box
in
the
corridor
he
found
valentin
and
his
companion
walking
towards
him
the
latter
was
thrusting
a
card
into
his
waistcoat
pocket
mademoiselle
noémie
s
jealous
votary
was
a
tall
robust
young
man
with
a
thick
nose
a
prominent
blue
eye
a
germanic
physiognomy
and
a
massive
when
they
reached
the
box
valentin
with
an
emphasized
bow
made
way
for
him
to
pass
in
first
newman
touched
valentin
s
arm
as
a
sign
that
he
wished
to
speak
with
him
and
bellegarde
answered
that
he
would
be
with
him
in
an
instant
valentin
entered
the
box
after
the
robust
young
man
but
a
couple
of
minutes
afterwards
he
reappeared
largely
smiling
she
is
immensely
tickled
he
said
she
says
we
will
make
her
fortune
i
don
t
want
to
be
fatuous
but
i
think
it
is
very
so
you
are
going
to
fight
said
newman
my
dear
fellow
don
t
look
so
mortally
disgusted
it
was
not
my
choice
the
thing
is
all
i
told
you
so
groaned
newman
i
told
so
said
valentin
smiling
what
did
he
do
to
you
my
good
friend
it
doesn
t
matter
what
he
used
an
expression
i
took
it
but
i
insist
upon
knowing
i
can
t
as
your
elder
brother
have
you
rushing
into
this
sort
of
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
said
valentin
i
have
nothing
to
conceal
but
i
can
t
go
into
particulars
now
and
we
will
leave
this
place
then
you
can
tell
me
oh
no
i
can
t
leave
this
place
why
should
i
hurry
away
i
will
go
to
my
and
sit
out
the
you
will
not
enjoy
it
you
will
be
valentin
looked
at
him
a
moment
colored
a
little
smiled
and
patted
him
on
the
arm
you
are
delightfully
simple
before
an
affair
a
man
is
quiet
the
quietest
thing
i
can
do
is
to
go
straight
to
my
ah
said
newman
you
want
her
to
see
you
there
you
and
your
quietness
i
am
not
so
simple
it
is
a
poor
valentin
remained
and
the
two
men
in
their
respective
places
sat
out
the
rest
of
the
performance
which
was
also
enjoyed
by
mademoiselle
nioche
and
her
truculent
admirer
at
the
end
newman
joined
valentin
again
and
they
went
into
the
street
together
valentin
shook
his
head
at
his
friend
s
proposal
that
he
should
get
into
newman
s
own
vehicle
and
stopped
on
the
edge
of
the
pavement
i
must
go
off
alone
he
said
i
must
look
up
a
couple
of
friends
who
will
take
charge
of
this
i
will
take
charge
of
it
newman
declared
put
it
into
my
you
are
very
kind
but
that
is
hardly
possible
in
the
first
place
you
are
as
you
said
just
now
almost
my
brother
you
are
about
to
marry
my
sister
that
alone
disqualifies
you
it
casts
doubts
on
your
impartiality
and
if
it
didn
t
it
would
be
enough
for
me
that
i
strongly
suspect
you
of
disapproving
of
the
affair
you
would
try
to
prevent
a
of
course
i
should
said
newman
whoever
your
friends
are
i
hope
they
will
do
unquestionably
they
will
they
will
urge
that
excuses
be
made
proper
excuses
but
you
would
be
too
you
won
t
newman
was
silent
a
moment
he
was
keenly
annoyed
but
he
saw
it
was
useless
to
attempt
interference
when
is
this
precious
performance
to
come
off
he
asked
the
sooner
the
better
said
valentin
the
day
after
i
well
said
newman
i
have
certainly
a
claim
to
know
the
facts
i
can
t
consent
to
shut
my
eyes
to
the
i
shall
be
most
happy
to
tell
you
the
facts
said
valentin
they
are
very
simple
and
it
will
be
quickly
done
but
now
everything
depends
on
my
putting
my
hands
on
my
friends
without
delay
i
will
jump
into
a
cab
you
had
better
drive
to
my
room
and
wait
for
me
there
i
will
turn
up
at
the
end
of
an
newman
assented
protestingly
let
his
friend
go
and
then
betook
himself
to
the
picturesque
little
apartment
in
the
rue
d
anjou
it
was
more
than
an
hour
before
valentin
returned
but
when
he
did
so
he
was
able
to
announce
that
he
had
found
one
of
his
desired
friends
and
that
this
gentleman
had
taken
upon
himself
the
care
of
securing
an
associate
newman
had
been
sitting
without
lights
by
valentin
s
faded
fire
upon
which
he
had
thrown
a
log
the
blaze
played
over
the
little
and
produced
fantastic
gleams
and
shadows
he
listened
in
silence
to
valentin
s
account
of
what
had
passed
between
him
and
the
gentleman
whose
card
he
had
in
his
pocket
stanislas
kapp
of
strasbourg
after
his
return
to
mademoiselle
nioche
s
box
this
hospitable
young
lady
had
espied
an
acquaintance
on
the
other
side
of
the
house
and
had
expressed
her
displeasure
at
his
not
having
the
civility
to
come
and
pay
her
a
visit
oh
let
him
alone
stanislas
kapp
had
hereupon
exclaimed
there
are
too
many
people
in
the
box
and
he
had
fixed
his
eyes
with
a
demonstrative
stare
upon
de
bellegarde
valentin
had
promptly
retorted
that
if
there
were
too
many
people
in
the
box
it
was
easy
for
kapp
to
diminish
the
number
i
shall
be
most
happy
to
open
the
door
for
kapp
exclaimed
i
shall
be
delighted
to
fling
you
into
the
pit
valentin
had
answered
oh
do
make
a
rumpus
and
get
into
the
papers
miss
noémie
had
gleefully
ejaculated
m
kapp
turn
him
out
or
de
bellegarde
pitch
him
into
the
pit
into
the
orchestra
anywhere
i
don
t
care
who
does
which
so
long
as
you
make
a
valentin
answered
that
they
would
make
no
scene
but
that
the
gentleman
would
be
so
good
as
to
step
into
the
corridor
with
him
in
the
corridor
after
a
brief
further
exchange
of
words
there
had
been
an
exchange
of
cards
stanislas
kapp
was
very
stiff
he
evidently
meant
to
force
his
offence
home
the
man
no
doubt
was
insolent
newman
said
but
if
you
hadn
t
gone
back
into
the
box
the
thing
wouldn
t
have
why
don
t
you
see
valentin
replied
that
the
event
proves
the
extreme
propriety
of
my
going
back
into
the
box
kapp
wished
to
provoke
me
he
was
awaiting
his
chance
in
such
a
case
that
is
when
he
has
been
so
to
speak
notified
a
man
must
be
on
hand
to
receive
the
provocation
my
not
returning
would
simply
have
been
tantamount
to
my
saying
to
stanislas
kapp
oh
if
you
are
going
to
be
disagreeable
you
must
manage
it
by
yourself
damned
if
i
ll
help
you
that
would
have
been
a
thoroughly
sensible
thing
to
say
the
only
attraction
for
you
seems
to
have
been
the
prospect
of
kapp
s
impertinence
newman
went
on
you
told
me
you
were
not
going
back
for
that
oh
don
t
mention
that
girl
any
more
murmured
valentin
she
s
a
with
all
my
heart
but
if
that
is
the
way
you
feel
about
her
why
couldn
t
you
let
her
alone
valentin
shook
his
head
with
a
fine
smile
i
don
t
think
you
quite
understand
and
i
don
t
believe
i
can
make
you
she
understood
the
situation
she
knew
what
was
in
the
air
she
was
watching
a
cat
may
look
at
a
king
what
difference
does
that
make
why
a
man
can
t
back
down
before
a
i
don
t
call
her
a
woman
you
said
yourself
she
was
a
stone
cried
newman
well
valentin
rejoined
there
is
no
disputing
about
tastes
it
s
a
matter
of
feeling
it
s
measured
by
one
s
sense
of
oh
confound
your
sense
of
honor
cried
newman
it
is
vain
talking
said
valentin
words
have
passed
and
the
thing
is
newman
turned
away
taking
his
hat
then
pausing
with
his
hand
on
the
door
what
are
you
going
to
use
he
asked
that
is
for
stanislas
kapp
as
the
challenged
party
to
decide
my
own
choice
would
be
a
short
light
sword
i
handle
it
well
i
m
an
indifferent
newman
had
put
on
his
hat
he
pushed
it
back
gently
scratching
his
forehead
high
up
i
wish
it
were
pistols
he
said
i
could
show
you
how
to
lodge
a
bullet
valentin
broke
into
a
laugh
what
is
it
some
english
poet
says
about
consistency
it
s
a
flower
or
a
star
or
a
jewel
yours
has
the
beauty
of
all
three
but
he
agreed
to
see
newman
again
on
the
morrow
after
the
details
of
his
meeting
with
stanislas
kapp
should
have
been
arranged
in
the
course
of
the
day
newman
received
three
lines
from
him
saying
that
it
had
been
decided
that
he
should
cross
the
frontier
with
his
adversary
and
that
he
was
to
take
the
night
express
to
geneva
he
should
have
time
however
to
dine
with
newman
in
the
afternoon
newman
called
upon
madame
de
cintré
but
his
visit
was
brief
she
was
as
gracious
and
sympathetic
as
he
had
ever
found
her
but
she
was
sad
and
she
confessed
on
newman
s
charging
her
with
her
red
eyes
that
she
had
been
crying
valentin
had
been
with
her
a
couple
of
hours
before
and
his
visit
had
left
her
with
a
painful
impression
he
had
laughed
and
gossiped
he
had
brought
her
no
bad
news
he
had
only
been
in
his
manner
rather
more
affectionate
than
usual
his
fraternal
tenderness
had
touched
her
and
on
his
departure
she
had
burst
into
tears
she
had
felt
as
if
something
strange
and
sad
were
going
to
happen
she
had
tried
to
reason
away
the
fancy
and
the
effort
had
only
given
her
a
headache
newman
of
course
was
perforce
about
valentin
s
projected
duel
and
his
dramatic
talent
was
not
equal
to
satirizing
madame
de
cintré
s
presentiment
as
pointedly
as
perfect
security
demanded
before
he
went
away
he
asked
madame
de
cintré
whether
valentin
had
seen
his
mother
yes
she
said
but
he
didn
t
make
her
it
was
in
newman
s
own
apartment
that
valentin
dined
having
brought
his
portmanteau
so
that
he
might
adjourn
directly
to
the
railway
stanislas
kapp
had
positively
declined
to
make
excuses
and
he
on
his
side
obviously
had
none
to
offer
valentin
had
found
out
with
whom
he
was
dealing
stanislas
kapp
was
the
son
of
and
heir
of
a
rich
brewer
of
strasbourg
a
youth
of
a
sanguineous
and
sanguinary
temperament
he
was
making
ducks
and
drakes
of
the
paternal
brewery
and
although
he
passed
in
a
general
way
for
a
good
fellow
he
had
already
been
observed
to
be
quarrelsome
after
dinner
said
valentin
brought
up
on
beer
he
can
t
stand
he
had
chosen
pistols
valentin
at
dinner
had
an
excellent
appetite
he
made
a
point
in
view
of
his
long
journey
of
eating
more
than
usual
he
took
the
liberty
of
suggesting
to
newman
a
slight
modification
in
the
composition
of
a
certain
he
thought
it
would
be
worth
mentioning
to
the
cook
but
newman
had
no
thoughts
for
he
felt
thoroughly
discontented
as
he
sat
and
watched
his
amiable
and
clever
companion
going
through
his
excellent
repast
with
the
delicate
deliberation
of
hereditary
epicurism
the
folly
of
so
charming
a
fellow
traveling
off
to
expose
his
agreeable
young
life
for
the
sake
of
stanislas
and
mademoiselle
noémie
struck
him
with
intolerable
force
he
had
grown
fond
of
valentin
he
felt
now
how
fond
and
his
sense
of
helplessness
only
increased
his
irritation
well
this
sort
of
thing
may
be
all
very
well
he
cried
at
last
but
i
declare
i
don
t
see
it
i
can
t
stop
you
perhaps
but
at
least
i
can
protest
i
do
protest
my
dear
fellow
don
t
make
a
scene
said
valentin
scenes
in
these
cases
are
in
very
bad
your
duel
itself
is
a
scene
said
newman
that
s
all
it
is
it
s
a
wretched
theatrical
affair
why
don
t
you
take
a
band
of
music
with
you
outright
it
s
d
d
barbarous
and
it
s
d
d
corrupt
oh
i
can
t
begin
at
this
time
of
day
to
defend
the
theory
of
dueling
said
valentin
it
is
our
custom
and
i
think
it
is
a
good
thing
quite
apart
from
the
goodness
of
the
cause
in
which
a
duel
may
be
fought
it
has
a
kind
of
picturesque
charm
which
in
this
age
of
vile
prose
seems
to
me
greatly
to
recommend
it
it
s
a
remnant
of
a
time
one
ought
to
cling
to
it
depend
upon
it
a
duel
is
never
i
don
t
know
what
you
mean
by
a
time
said
newman
because
your
was
an
ass
is
that
any
reason
why
you
should
be
for
my
part
i
think
we
had
better
let
our
temper
take
care
of
itself
it
generally
seems
to
me
quite
high
enough
i
am
not
afraid
of
being
too
meek
if
your
were
to
make
himself
unpleasant
to
me
i
think
i
could
manage
him
my
dear
friend
said
valentin
smiling
you
can
t
invent
anything
that
will
take
the
place
of
satisfaction
for
an
insult
to
demand
it
and
to
give
it
are
equally
excellent
do
you
call
this
sort
of
thing
satisfaction
newman
asked
does
it
satisfy
you
to
receive
a
present
of
the
carcass
of
that
coarse
fop
does
it
gratify
you
to
make
him
a
present
of
yours
if
a
man
hits
you
hit
him
back
if
a
man
libels
you
haul
him
haul
him
up
into
court
oh
that
is
very
nasty
said
valentin
the
nastiness
is
his
not
yours
and
for
that
matter
what
you
are
doing
is
not
particularly
nice
you
are
too
good
for
it
i
don
t
say
you
are
the
most
useful
man
in
the
world
or
the
cleverest
or
the
most
amiable
but
you
are
too
good
to
go
and
get
your
throat
cut
for
a
valentin
flushed
a
little
but
he
laughed
i
shan
t
get
my
throat
cut
if
i
can
help
it
moreover
one
s
honor
hasn
t
two
different
measures
it
only
knows
that
it
is
hurt
it
doesn
t
ask
when
or
how
or
the
more
fool
it
is
said
newman
valentin
ceased
to
laugh
he
looked
grave
i
beg
you
not
to
say
any
more
he
said
if
you
do
i
shall
almost
fancy
you
don
t
care
about
about
and
he
paused
about
what
about
that
matter
about
one
s
fancy
what
you
please
said
newman
fancy
while
you
are
at
it
that
i
care
about
though
you
are
not
worth
it
but
come
back
without
damage
he
added
in
a
moment
and
i
will
forgive
you
and
then
he
continued
as
valentin
was
going
i
will
ship
you
straight
off
to
well
answered
valentin
if
i
am
to
turn
over
a
new
page
this
may
figure
as
a
to
the
and
then
he
lit
another
cigar
and
departed
blast
that
girl
said
newman
as
the
door
closed
upon
valentin
chapter
xviii
newman
went
the
next
morning
to
see
madame
de
cintré
timing
his
visit
so
as
to
arrive
after
the
noonday
breakfast
in
the
court
of
the
before
the
portico
stood
madame
de
bellegarde
s
old
square
carriage
the
servant
who
opened
the
door
answered
newman
s
inquiry
with
a
slightly
embarrassed
and
hesitating
murmur
and
at
the
same
moment
mrs
bread
appeared
in
the
background
as
usual
and
wearing
a
large
black
bonnet
and
shawl
what
is
the
matter
asked
newman
is
madame
la
comtesse
at
home
or
not
mrs
bread
advanced
fixing
her
eyes
upon
him
he
observed
that
she
held
a
sealed
letter
very
delicately
in
her
fingers
the
countess
has
left
a
message
for
you
sir
she
has
left
this
said
mrs
bread
holding
out
the
letter
which
newman
took
left
it
is
she
out
is
she
gone
away
she
is
going
away
sir
she
is
leaving
town
said
mrs
bread
leaving
town
exclaimed
newman
what
has
happened
it
is
not
for
me
to
say
sir
said
mrs
bread
with
her
eyes
on
the
ground
but
i
thought
it
would
what
would
come
pray
newman
demanded
he
had
broken
the
seal
of
the
letter
but
he
still
questioned
she
is
in
the
house
she
is
visible
i
don
t
think
she
expected
you
this
morning
the
old
replied
she
was
to
leave
where
is
she
going
to
to
fleurières
but
surely
i
can
see
her
mrs
bread
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
clasping
together
her
two
hands
i
will
take
you
she
said
and
she
led
the
way
upstairs
at
the
top
of
the
staircase
she
paused
and
fixed
her
dry
sad
eyes
upon
newman
be
very
easy
with
her
she
said
she
is
most
unhappy
then
she
went
on
to
madame
de
cintré
s
apartment
newman
perplexed
and
alarmed
followed
her
rapidly
mrs
bread
threw
open
the
door
and
newman
pushed
back
the
curtain
at
the
farther
side
of
its
deep
embrasure
in
the
middle
of
the
room
stood
madame
de
cintré
her
face
was
pale
and
she
was
dressed
for
traveling
behind
her
before
the
stood
urbain
de
bellegarde
looking
at
his
near
the
marquis
sat
his
mother
buried
in
an
armchair
and
with
her
eyes
immediately
fixing
themselves
upon
newman
he
felt
as
soon
as
he
entered
the
room
that
he
was
in
the
presence
of
something
evil
he
was
startled
and
pained
as
he
would
have
been
by
a
threatening
cry
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
he
walked
straight
to
madame
de
cintré
and
seized
her
by
the
hand
what
is
the
matter
he
asked
commandingly
what
is
happening
urbain
de
bellegarde
stared
then
left
his
place
and
came
and
leaned
upon
his
mother
s
chair
behind
newman
s
sudden
irruption
had
evidently
discomposed
both
mother
and
son
madame
de
cintré
stood
silent
with
her
eyes
resting
upon
newman
s
she
had
often
looked
at
him
with
all
her
soul
as
it
seemed
to
him
but
in
this
present
gaze
there
was
a
sort
of
bottomless
depth
she
was
in
distress
it
was
the
most
touching
thing
he
had
ever
seen
his
heart
rose
into
his
throat
and
he
was
on
the
point
of
turning
to
her
companions
with
an
angry
challenge
but
she
checked
him
pressing
the
hand
that
held
her
own
something
very
grave
has
happened
she
said
i
can
not
marry
newman
dropped
her
hand
and
stood
staring
first
at
her
and
then
at
the
others
why
not
he
asked
as
quietly
as
possible
madame
de
cintré
almost
smiled
but
the
attempt
was
strange
you
must
ask
my
mother
you
must
ask
my
why
can
t
she
marry
me
said
newman
looking
at
them
madame
de
bellegarde
did
not
move
in
her
place
but
she
was
as
pale
as
her
daughter
the
marquis
looked
down
at
her
she
said
nothing
for
some
moments
but
she
kept
her
keen
clear
eyes
upon
newman
bravely
the
marquis
drew
himself
up
and
looked
at
the
ceiling
it
s
impossible
he
said
softly
it
s
improper
said
madame
de
bellegarde
newman
began
to
laugh
oh
you
are
fooling
he
exclaimed
my
sister
you
have
no
time
you
are
losing
your
train
said
the
marquis
come
is
he
mad
asked
newman
no
don
t
think
that
said
madame
de
cintré
but
i
am
going
where
are
you
going
to
the
country
to
fleurières
to
be
to
leave
me
said
newman
slowly
i
can
t
see
you
now
said
madame
de
cintré
why
not
i
am
ashamed
said
madame
de
cintré
simply
newman
turned
toward
the
marquis
what
have
you
done
to
her
what
does
it
mean
he
asked
with
the
same
effort
at
calmness
the
fruit
of
his
constant
practice
in
taking
things
easily
he
was
excited
but
excitement
with
him
was
only
an
intenser
deliberateness
it
was
the
swimmer
stripped
it
means
that
i
have
given
you
up
said
madame
de
cintré
it
means
her
face
was
too
charged
with
tragic
expression
not
fully
to
confirm
her
words
newman
was
profoundly
shocked
but
he
felt
as
yet
no
resentment
against
her
he
was
amazed
bewildered
and
the
presence
of
the
old
marquise
and
her
son
seemed
to
smite
his
eyes
like
the
glare
of
a
watchman
s
lantern
can
t
i
see
you
alone
he
asked
it
would
be
only
more
painful
i
hoped
i
should
not
see
you
i
should
escape
i
wrote
to
you
and
she
put
out
her
hand
again
newman
put
both
his
own
into
his
pockets
i
will
go
with
you
he
said
she
laid
her
two
hands
on
his
arm
will
you
grant
me
a
last
request
and
as
she
looked
at
him
urging
this
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
let
me
go
alone
let
me
go
in
peace
i
can
t
call
it
peace
it
s
death
but
let
me
bury
myself
so
newman
passed
his
hand
into
his
hair
and
stood
slowly
rubbing
his
head
and
looking
through
his
eyes
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
three
persons
before
him
his
lips
were
compressed
and
the
two
lines
which
had
formed
themselves
beside
his
mouth
might
have
made
it
appear
at
a
first
glance
that
he
was
smiling
i
have
said
that
his
excitement
was
an
intenser
deliberateness
and
now
he
looked
grimly
deliberate
it
seems
very
much
as
if
you
had
interfered
marquis
he
said
slowly
i
thought
you
said
you
wouldn
t
interfere
i
know
you
don
t
like
me
but
that
doesn
t
make
any
difference
i
thought
you
promised
me
you
wouldn
t
interfere
i
thought
you
swore
on
your
honor
that
you
wouldn
t
interfere
don
t
you
remember
marquis
the
marquis
lifted
his
eyebrows
but
he
was
apparently
determined
to
be
even
more
urbane
than
usual
he
rested
his
two
hands
upon
the
back
of
his
mother
s
chair
and
bent
forward
as
if
he
were
leaning
over
the
edge
of
a
pulpit
or
a
he
did
not
smile
but
he
looked
softly
grave
excuse
me
sir
he
said
i
assured
you
that
i
would
not
influence
my
sister
s
decision
i
adhered
to
the
letter
to
my
engagement
did
i
not
sister
don
t
appeal
my
son
said
the
marquise
your
word
is
yes
she
accepted
me
said
newman
that
is
very
true
i
can
t
deny
that
at
least
he
added
in
a
different
tone
turning
to
madame
de
cintré
you
accept
me
something
in
the
tone
seemed
to
move
her
strongly
she
turned
away
burying
her
face
in
her
hands
but
you
have
interfered
now
haven
t
you
inquired
newman
of
the
marquis
neither
then
nor
now
have
i
attempted
to
influence
my
sister
i
used
no
persuasion
then
i
have
used
no
persuasion
and
what
have
you
used
we
have
used
authority
said
madame
de
bellegarde
in
a
rich
voice
ah
you
have
used
authority
newman
exclaimed
they
have
used
authority
he
went
on
turning
to
madame
de
cintré
what
is
it
how
did
they
use
it
my
mother
commanded
said
madame
de
cintré
commanded
you
to
give
me
up
i
see
and
you
obey
i
see
but
why
do
you
obey
asked
newman
madame
de
cintré
looked
across
at
the
old
marquise
her
eyes
slowly
measured
her
from
head
to
foot
i
am
afraid
of
my
mother
she
said
madame
de
bellegarde
rose
with
a
certain
quickness
crying
this
is
a
most
indecent
scene
i
have
no
wish
to
prolong
it
said
madame
de
cintré
and
turning
to
the
door
she
put
out
her
hand
again
if
you
can
pity
me
a
little
let
me
go
newman
shook
her
hand
quietly
and
firmly
i
ll
come
down
there
he
said
the
dropped
behind
her
and
newman
sank
with
a
long
breath
into
the
nearest
chair
he
leaned
back
in
it
resting
his
hands
on
the
knobs
of
the
arms
and
looking
at
madame
de
bellegarde
and
urbain
there
was
a
long
silence
they
stood
side
by
side
with
their
heads
high
and
their
handsome
eyebrows
arched
so
you
make
a
distinction
newman
said
at
last
you
make
a
distinction
between
persuading
and
commanding
it
s
very
neat
but
the
distinction
is
in
favor
of
commanding
that
rather
spoils
we
have
not
the
least
objection
to
defining
our
position
said
de
bellegarde
we
understand
that
it
should
not
at
first
appear
to
you
quite
clear
we
rather
expected
indeed
that
you
should
not
do
us
oh
i
ll
do
you
justice
said
newman
don
t
be
afraid
please
the
marquise
laid
her
hand
on
her
son
s
arm
as
if
to
deprecate
the
attempt
to
define
their
position
it
is
quite
useless
she
said
to
try
and
arrange
this
matter
so
as
to
make
it
agreeable
to
you
it
can
never
be
agreeable
to
you
it
is
a
disappointment
and
disappointments
are
unpleasant
i
thought
it
over
carefully
and
tried
to
arrange
it
better
but
i
only
gave
myself
a
headache
and
lost
my
sleep
say
what
we
will
you
will
think
yourself
and
you
will
publish
your
wrongs
among
your
friends
but
we
are
not
afraid
of
that
besides
your
friends
are
not
our
friends
and
it
will
not
matter
think
of
us
as
you
please
i
only
beg
you
not
to
be
violent
i
have
never
in
my
life
been
present
at
a
violent
scene
of
any
kind
and
at
my
age
i
can
t
be
expected
to
is
all
you
have
got
to
say
asked
newman
slowly
rising
out
of
his
chair
that
s
a
poor
show
for
a
clever
lady
like
you
marquise
come
try
my
mother
goes
to
the
point
with
her
usual
honesty
and
intrepidity
said
the
marquis
toying
with
his
but
it
is
perhaps
well
to
say
a
little
more
we
of
course
quite
repudiate
the
charge
of
having
broken
faith
with
you
we
left
you
entirely
at
liberty
to
make
yourself
agreeable
to
my
sister
we
left
her
quite
at
liberty
to
entertain
your
proposal
when
she
accepted
you
we
said
nothing
we
therefore
quite
observed
our
promise
it
was
only
at
a
later
stage
of
the
affair
and
on
quite
a
different
basis
as
it
were
that
we
determined
to
speak
it
would
have
been
better
perhaps
if
we
had
spoken
before
but
really
you
see
nothing
has
yet
been
nothing
has
yet
been
done
newman
repeated
the
words
unconscious
of
their
comical
effect
he
had
lost
the
sense
of
what
the
marquis
was
saying
de
bellegarde
s
superior
style
was
a
mere
humming
in
his
ears
all
that
he
understood
in
his
deep
and
simple
indignation
was
that
the
matter
was
not
a
violent
joke
and
that
the
people
before
him
were
perfectly
serious
do
you
suppose
i
can
take
this
he
asked
do
you
suppose
it
can
matter
to
me
what
you
say
do
you
suppose
i
can
seriously
listen
to
you
you
are
simply
crazy
madame
de
bellegarde
gave
a
rap
with
her
fan
in
the
palm
of
her
hand
if
you
don
t
take
it
you
can
leave
it
sir
it
matters
very
little
what
you
do
my
daughter
has
given
you
she
doesn
t
mean
it
newman
declared
after
a
moment
i
think
i
can
assure
you
that
she
does
said
the
marquis
poor
woman
what
damnable
thing
have
you
done
to
her
cried
newman
gently
gently
murmured
de
bellegarde
she
told
you
said
the
old
lady
i
commanded
newman
shook
his
head
heavily
this
sort
of
thing
can
t
be
you
know
he
said
a
man
can
t
be
used
in
this
fashion
you
have
got
no
right
you
have
got
no
my
power
said
madame
de
bellegarde
is
in
my
children
s
in
their
fear
your
daughter
said
there
is
something
very
strange
in
it
why
should
your
daughter
be
afraid
of
you
added
newman
after
looking
a
moment
at
the
old
lady
there
is
some
foul
the
marquise
met
his
gaze
without
flinching
and
as
if
she
did
not
hear
or
heed
what
he
said
i
did
my
best
she
said
quietly
i
could
endure
it
no
it
was
a
bold
experiment
said
the
marquis
newman
felt
disposed
to
walk
to
him
clutch
his
neck
with
his
fingers
and
press
his
windpipe
with
his
thumb
i
needn
t
tell
you
how
you
strike
me
he
said
of
course
you
know
that
but
i
should
think
you
would
be
afraid
of
your
friends
all
those
people
you
introduced
me
to
the
other
night
there
were
some
very
nice
people
among
them
you
may
depend
upon
it
there
were
some
honest
men
and
our
friends
approve
us
said
de
bellegarde
there
is
not
a
family
among
them
that
would
have
acted
otherwise
and
however
that
may
be
we
take
the
cue
from
no
one
the
bellegardes
have
been
used
to
set
the
example
not
to
wait
for
you
would
have
waited
long
before
anyone
would
have
set
you
such
an
example
as
this
exclaimed
newman
have
i
done
anything
wrong
he
demanded
have
i
given
you
reason
to
change
your
opinion
have
you
found
out
anything
against
me
i
can
t
our
opinion
said
madame
de
bellegarde
is
quite
the
same
as
at
first
exactly
we
have
no
towards
yourself
we
are
very
far
from
accusing
you
of
misconduct
since
your
relations
with
us
began
you
have
been
i
frankly
confess
less
less
peculiar
than
i
expected
it
is
not
your
disposition
that
we
object
to
it
is
your
antecedents
we
really
can
not
reconcile
ourselves
to
a
commercial
person
we
fancied
in
an
evil
hour
that
we
could
it
was
a
great
misfortune
we
determined
to
persevere
to
the
end
and
to
give
you
every
advantage
i
was
resolved
that
you
should
have
no
reason
to
accuse
me
of
want
of
loyalty
we
let
the
thing
certainly
go
very
far
we
introduced
you
to
our
friends
to
tell
the
truth
it
was
that
i
think
that
broke
me
down
i
succumbed
to
the
scene
that
took
place
on
thursday
night
in
these
rooms
you
must
excuse
me
if
what
i
say
is
disagreeable
to
you
but
we
can
not
release
ourselves
without
an
there
can
be
no
better
proof
of
our
good
faith
said
the
marquis
than
our
committing
ourselves
to
you
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
the
other
evening
we
endeavored
to
bind
ourselves
to
tie
our
hands
as
it
but
it
was
that
added
his
mother
that
opened
our
eyes
and
broke
our
bonds
we
should
have
been
most
uncomfortable
you
know
she
added
in
a
moment
that
you
were
forewarned
i
told
you
we
were
very
newman
took
up
his
hat
and
began
mechanically
to
smooth
it
the
very
fierceness
of
his
scorn
kept
him
from
speaking
you
are
not
proud
enough
he
observed
at
last
in
all
this
matter
said
the
marquis
smiling
i
really
see
nothing
but
our
let
us
have
no
more
discussion
than
is
necessary
resumed
madame
de
bellegarde
my
daughter
told
you
everything
when
she
said
she
gave
you
i
am
not
satisfied
about
your
daughter
said
newman
i
want
to
know
what
you
did
to
her
it
is
all
very
easy
talking
about
authority
and
saying
you
commanded
her
she
didn
t
accept
me
blindly
and
she
wouldn
t
have
given
me
up
blindly
not
that
i
believe
yet
she
has
really
given
me
up
she
will
talk
it
over
with
me
but
you
have
frightened
her
you
have
bullied
her
you
have
her
what
was
it
you
did
to
her
i
did
very
little
said
madame
de
bellegarde
in
a
tone
which
gave
newman
a
chill
when
he
afterwards
remembered
it
let
me
remind
you
that
we
offered
you
these
explanations
the
marquis
observed
with
the
express
understanding
that
you
should
abstain
from
violence
of
i
am
not
violent
newman
answered
it
is
you
who
are
violent
but
i
don
t
know
that
i
have
much
more
to
say
to
you
what
you
expect
of
me
apparently
is
to
go
my
way
thanking
you
for
favors
received
and
promising
never
to
trouble
you
we
expect
of
you
to
act
like
a
clever
man
said
madame
de
bellegarde
you
have
shown
yourself
that
already
and
what
we
have
done
is
altogether
based
upon
your
being
so
when
one
must
submit
one
must
since
my
daughter
absolutely
withdraws
what
will
be
the
use
of
your
making
a
noise
it
remains
to
be
seen
whether
your
daughter
absolutely
withdraws
your
daughter
and
i
are
still
very
good
friends
nothing
is
changed
in
that
as
i
say
i
will
talk
it
over
with
that
will
be
of
no
use
said
the
old
lady
i
know
my
daughter
well
enough
to
know
that
words
spoken
as
she
just
now
spoke
to
you
are
final
besides
she
has
promised
i
have
no
doubt
her
promise
is
worth
a
great
deal
more
than
your
own
said
newman
nevertheless
i
don
t
give
her
just
as
you
please
but
if
she
won
t
even
see
you
and
she
won
t
your
constancy
must
remain
purely
poor
newman
was
feigning
a
greater
confidence
than
he
felt
madame
de
cintré
s
strange
intensity
had
in
fact
struck
a
chill
to
his
heart
her
face
still
impressed
upon
his
vision
had
been
a
terribly
vivid
image
of
renunciation
he
felt
sick
and
suddenly
helpless
he
turned
away
and
stood
for
a
moment
with
his
hand
on
the
door
then
he
faced
about
and
after
the
briefest
hesitation
broke
out
with
a
different
accent
come
think
of
what
this
must
be
to
me
and
let
her
alone
why
should
you
object
to
me
so
what
s
the
matter
with
me
i
can
t
hurt
you
i
wouldn
t
if
i
could
i
m
the
most
unobjectionable
fellow
in
the
world
what
if
i
am
a
commercial
person
what
under
the
sun
do
you
mean
a
commercial
person
i
will
be
any
sort
of
a
person
you
want
i
never
talked
to
you
about
business
let
her
go
and
i
will
ask
no
questions
i
will
take
her
away
and
you
shall
never
see
me
or
hear
of
me
again
i
will
stay
in
america
if
you
like
i
ll
sign
a
paper
promising
never
to
come
back
to
europe
all
i
want
is
not
to
lose
her
madame
de
bellegarde
and
her
son
exchanged
a
glance
of
lucid
irony
and
urbain
said
my
dear
sir
what
you
propose
is
hardly
an
improvement
we
have
not
the
slightest
objection
to
seeing
you
as
an
amiable
foreigner
and
we
have
every
reason
for
not
wishing
to
be
eternally
separated
from
my
sister
we
object
to
the
marriage
and
in
that
way
and
de
bellegarde
gave
a
small
thin
laugh
she
would
be
more
married
than
well
then
said
newman
where
is
this
place
of
yours
fleurières
i
know
it
is
near
some
old
city
on
a
precisely
poitiers
is
on
a
hill
said
madame
de
bellegarde
i
don
t
know
how
old
it
is
we
are
not
afraid
to
tell
it
is
poitiers
is
it
very
good
said
newman
i
shall
immediately
follow
madame
de
the
trains
after
this
hour
won
t
serve
you
said
urbain
i
shall
hire
a
special
train
that
will
be
a
very
silly
waste
of
money
said
madame
de
bellegarde
it
will
be
time
enough
to
talk
about
waste
three
days
hence
newman
answered
and
clapping
his
hat
on
his
head
he
departed
he
did
not
immediately
start
for
fleurières
he
was
too
stunned
and
wounded
for
consecutive
action
he
simply
walked
he
walked
straight
before
him
following
the
river
till
he
got
out
of
the
of
paris
he
had
a
burning
tingling
sense
of
personal
outrage
he
had
never
in
his
life
received
so
absolute
a
check
he
had
never
been
pulled
up
or
as
he
would
have
said
let
down
so
short
and
he
found
the
sensation
intolerable
he
strode
along
tapping
the
trees
and
fiercely
with
his
stick
and
inwardly
raging
to
lose
madame
de
cintré
after
he
had
taken
such
jubilant
and
triumphant
possession
of
her
was
as
great
an
affront
to
his
pride
as
it
was
an
injury
to
his
happiness
and
to
lose
her
by
the
interference
and
the
dictation
of
others
by
an
impudent
old
woman
and
a
pretentious
fop
stepping
in
with
their
authority
it
was
too
preposterous
it
was
too
pitiful
upon
what
he
deemed
the
unblushing
treachery
of
the
bellegardes
newman
wasted
little
thought
he
consigned
it
once
for
all
to
eternal
perdition
but
the
treachery
of
madame
de
cintré
herself
amazed
and
confounded
him
there
was
a
key
to
the
mystery
of
course
but
he
groped
for
it
in
vain
only
three
days
had
elapsed
since
she
stood
beside
him
in
the
starlight
beautiful
and
tranquil
as
the
trust
with
which
he
had
inspired
her
and
told
him
that
she
was
happy
in
the
prospect
of
their
marriage
what
was
the
meaning
of
the
change
of
what
infernal
potion
had
she
tasted
poor
newman
had
a
terrible
apprehension
that
she
had
really
changed
his
very
admiration
for
her
attached
the
idea
of
force
and
weight
to
her
rupture
but
he
did
not
rail
at
her
as
false
for
he
was
sure
she
was
unhappy
in
his
walk
he
had
crossed
one
of
the
bridges
of
the
seine
and
he
still
followed
unheedingly
the
long
unbroken
quay
he
had
left
paris
behind
him
and
he
was
almost
in
the
country
he
was
in
the
pleasant
suburb
of
auteuil
he
stopped
at
last
looked
around
him
without
seeing
or
caring
for
its
pleasantness
and
then
slowly
turned
and
at
a
slower
pace
retraced
his
steps
when
he
came
abreast
of
the
fantastic
embankment
known
as
the
trocadero
he
reflected
through
his
throbbing
pain
that
he
was
near
tristram
s
dwelling
and
that
tristram
on
particular
occasions
had
much
of
a
woman
s
kindness
in
her
utterance
he
felt
that
he
needed
to
pour
out
his
ire
and
he
took
the
road
to
her
house
tristram
was
at
home
and
alone
and
as
soon
as
she
had
looked
at
him
on
his
entering
the
room
she
told
him
that
she
knew
what
he
had
come
for
newman
sat
down
heavily
in
silence
looking
at
her
they
have
backed
out
she
said
well
you
may
think
it
strange
but
i
felt
something
the
other
night
in
the
presently
he
told
her
his
story
she
listened
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
him
when
he
had
finished
she
said
quietly
they
want
her
to
marry
lord
newman
stared
he
did
not
know
that
she
knew
anything
about
lord
deepmere
but
i
don
t
think
she
will
tristram
added
marry
that
poor
little
cub
cried
newman
oh
lord
and
yet
why
did
she
refuse
me
but
that
isn
t
the
only
thing
said
tristram
they
really
couldn
t
endure
you
any
longer
they
had
overrated
their
courage
i
must
say
to
give
the
devil
his
due
that
there
is
something
rather
fine
in
that
it
was
your
commercial
quality
in
the
abstract
they
couldn
t
swallow
that
is
really
aristocratic
they
wanted
your
money
but
they
have
given
you
up
for
an
newman
frowned
most
ruefully
and
took
up
his
hat
again
i
thought
you
would
encourage
me
he
said
with
almost
childlike
sadness
excuse
me
she
answered
very
gently
i
feel
none
the
less
sorry
for
you
especially
as
i
am
at
the
bottom
of
your
troubles
i
have
not
forgotten
that
i
suggested
the
marriage
to
you
i
don
t
believe
that
madame
de
cintré
has
any
intention
of
marrying
lord
deepmere
it
is
true
he
is
not
younger
than
she
as
he
looks
he
is
years
old
i
looked
in
the
peerage
but
no
i
can
t
believe
her
so
horribly
cruelly
please
say
nothing
against
her
said
newman
poor
woman
she
cruel
but
of
course
you
will
go
after
her
and
you
will
plead
powerfully
do
you
know
that
as
you
are
now
tristram
pursued
with
characteristic
audacity
of
comment
you
are
extremely
eloquent
even
without
speaking
to
resist
you
a
woman
must
have
a
very
fixed
idea
in
her
head
i
wish
i
had
done
you
a
wrong
that
you
might
come
to
me
in
that
fine
fashion
but
go
to
madame
de
cintré
at
any
rate
and
tell
her
that
she
is
a
puzzle
even
to
me
i
am
very
curious
to
see
how
far
family
discipline
will
newman
sat
a
while
longer
leaning
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
his
head
in
his
hands
and
tristram
continued
to
temper
charity
with
philosophy
and
compassion
with
criticism
at
last
she
inquired
and
what
does
the
count
valentin
say
to
it
newman
started
he
had
not
thought
of
valentin
and
his
errand
on
the
swiss
frontier
since
the
morning
the
reflection
made
him
restless
again
and
he
took
his
leave
he
went
straight
to
his
apartment
where
upon
the
table
of
the
vestibule
he
found
a
telegram
it
ran
with
the
date
and
place
as
follows
i
am
seriously
ill
please
to
come
to
me
as
soon
as
possible
newman
groaned
at
this
miserable
news
and
at
the
necessity
of
deferring
his
journey
to
the
château
de
fleurières
but
he
wrote
to
madame
de
cintré
these
few
lines
they
were
all
he
had
time
for
i
don
t
give
you
up
and
i
don
t
really
believe
you
give
me
up
i
don
t
understand
it
but
we
shall
clear
it
up
together
i
can
t
follow
you
as
i
am
called
to
see
a
friend
at
a
distance
who
is
very
ill
perhaps
dying
but
i
shall
come
to
you
as
soon
as
i
can
leave
my
friend
why
shouldn
t
i
say
that
he
is
your
brother
after
this
he
had
only
time
to
catch
the
night
express
to
geneva
chapter
xix
newman
possessed
a
remarkable
talent
for
sitting
still
when
it
was
necessary
and
he
had
an
opportunity
to
use
it
on
his
journey
to
switzerland
the
successive
hours
of
the
night
brought
him
no
sleep
but
he
sat
motionless
in
his
corner
of
the
with
his
eyes
closed
and
the
most
observant
of
his
might
have
envied
him
his
apparent
slumber
toward
morning
slumber
really
came
as
an
effect
of
mental
rather
than
of
physical
fatigue
he
slept
for
a
couple
of
hours
and
at
last
waking
found
his
eyes
resting
upon
one
of
the
peaks
of
the
jura
behind
which
the
sky
was
just
reddening
with
the
dawn
but
he
saw
neither
the
cold
mountain
nor
the
warm
sky
his
consciousness
began
to
throb
again
on
the
very
instant
with
a
sense
of
his
wrong
he
got
out
of
the
train
half
an
hour
before
it
reached
geneva
in
the
cold
morning
twilight
at
the
station
indicated
in
valentin
s
telegram
a
drowsy
was
on
the
platform
with
a
lantern
and
the
hood
of
his
overcoat
over
his
head
and
near
him
stood
a
gentleman
who
advanced
to
meet
newman
this
personage
was
a
man
of
forty
with
a
tall
lean
figure
a
sallow
face
a
dark
eye
a
neat
moustache
and
a
pair
of
fresh
gloves
he
took
off
his
hat
looking
very
grave
and
pronounced
newman
s
name
our
hero
assented
and
said
you
are
de
bellegarde
s
friend
i
unite
with
you
in
claiming
that
sad
honor
said
the
gentleman
i
had
placed
myself
at
de
bellegarde
s
service
in
this
melancholy
affair
together
with
de
grosjoyaux
who
is
now
at
his
bedside
de
grosjoyaux
i
believe
has
had
the
honor
of
meeting
you
in
paris
but
as
he
is
a
better
nurse
than
i
he
remained
with
our
poor
friend
bellegarde
has
been
eagerly
expecting
and
how
is
bellegarde
said
newman
he
was
badly
hit
the
doctor
has
condemned
him
we
brought
a
surgeon
with
us
but
he
will
die
in
the
best
sentiments
i
sent
last
evening
for
the
curé
of
the
nearest
french
village
who
spent
an
hour
with
him
the
curé
was
quite
heaven
forgive
us
groaned
newman
i
would
rather
the
doctor
were
satisfied
and
can
he
see
me
shall
he
know
me
when
i
left
him
half
an
hour
ago
he
had
fallen
asleep
after
a
feverish
wakeful
night
but
we
shall
and
newman
s
companion
proceeded
to
lead
the
way
out
of
the
station
to
the
village
explaining
as
he
went
that
the
little
party
was
lodged
in
the
humblest
of
swiss
inns
where
however
they
had
succeeded
in
making
de
bellegarde
much
more
comfortable
than
could
at
first
have
been
expected
we
are
old
companions
in
arms
said
valentin
s
second
it
is
not
the
first
time
that
one
of
us
has
helped
the
other
to
lie
easily
it
is
a
very
nasty
wound
and
the
nastiest
thing
about
it
is
that
bellegarde
s
adversary
was
not
shot
he
put
his
bullet
where
he
could
it
took
it
into
its
head
to
walk
straight
into
bellegarde
s
left
side
just
below
the
as
they
picked
their
way
in
the
gray
deceptive
dawn
between
the
of
the
village
street
newman
s
new
acquaintance
narrated
the
particulars
of
the
duel
the
conditions
of
the
meeting
had
been
that
if
the
first
exchange
of
shots
should
fail
to
satisfy
one
of
the
two
gentlemen
a
second
should
take
place
valentin
s
first
bullet
had
done
exactly
what
newman
s
companion
was
convinced
he
had
intended
it
to
do
it
had
grazed
the
arm
of
stanislas
kapp
just
scratching
the
flesh
kapp
s
own
projectile
meanwhile
had
passed
at
ten
good
inches
from
the
person
of
valentin
the
representatives
of
stanislas
had
demanded
another
shot
which
was
granted
valentin
had
then
fired
aside
and
the
young
alsatian
had
done
effective
execution
i
saw
when
we
met
him
on
the
ground
said
newman
s
informant
that
he
was
not
going
to
be
it
is
a
kind
of
bovine
valentin
had
immediately
been
installed
at
the
inn
and
stanislas
and
his
friends
had
withdrawn
to
regions
unknown
the
police
authorities
of
the
canton
had
waited
upon
the
party
at
the
inn
had
been
extremely
majestic
and
had
drawn
up
a
long
but
it
was
probable
that
they
would
wink
at
so
very
gentlemanly
a
bit
of
bloodshed
newman
asked
whether
a
message
had
not
been
sent
to
valentin
s
family
and
learned
that
up
to
a
late
hour
on
the
preceding
evening
valentin
had
opposed
it
he
had
refused
to
believe
his
wound
was
dangerous
but
after
his
interview
with
the
curé
he
had
consented
and
a
telegram
had
been
dispatched
to
his
mother
but
the
marquise
had
better
hurry
said
newman
s
conductor
well
it
s
an
abominable
affair
said
newman
that
s
all
i
have
to
say
to
say
this
at
least
in
a
tone
of
infinite
disgust
was
an
irresistible
need
ah
you
don
t
approve
questioned
his
conductor
with
curious
urbanity
approve
cried
newman
i
wish
that
when
i
had
him
there
night
before
last
i
had
locked
him
up
in
my
de
toilette
valentin
s
late
second
opened
his
eyes
and
shook
his
head
up
and
down
two
or
three
times
gravely
with
a
little
whistle
but
they
had
reached
the
inn
and
a
stout
in
a
was
at
the
door
with
a
lantern
to
take
newman
s
from
the
porter
who
trudged
behind
him
valentin
was
lodged
on
the
at
the
back
of
the
house
and
newman
s
companion
went
along
a
passage
and
softly
opened
a
door
then
he
beckoned
to
newman
who
advanced
and
looked
into
the
room
which
was
lighted
by
a
single
shaded
candle
beside
the
fire
sat
de
grosjoyaux
asleep
in
his
a
little
plump
fair
man
whom
newman
had
seen
several
times
in
valentin
s
company
on
the
bed
lay
valentin
pale
and
still
with
his
eyes
closed
a
figure
very
shocking
to
newman
who
had
seen
it
hitherto
awake
to
its
fingertips
de
grosjoyaux
s
colleague
pointed
to
an
open
door
beyond
and
whispered
that
the
doctor
was
within
keeping
guard
so
long
as
valentin
slept
or
seemed
to
sleep
of
course
newman
could
not
approach
him
so
our
hero
withdrew
for
the
present
committing
himself
to
the
care
of
the
she
took
him
to
a
room
and
introduced
him
to
a
bed
on
which
a
magnified
bolster
in
yellow
calico
figured
as
a
counterpane
newman
lay
down
and
in
spite
of
his
counterpane
slept
for
three
or
four
hours
when
he
awoke
the
morning
was
advanced
and
the
sun
was
filling
his
window
and
he
heard
outside
of
it
the
clucking
of
hens
while
he
was
dressing
there
came
to
his
door
a
messenger
from
de
grosjoyaux
and
his
companion
proposing
that
he
should
breakfast
with
them
presently
he
went
downstairs
to
the
little
where
the
who
had
taken
off
her
was
serving
the
repast
de
grosjoyaux
was
there
surprisingly
fresh
for
a
gentleman
who
had
been
playing
half
the
night
rubbing
his
hands
and
watching
the
breakfast
table
attentively
newman
renewed
acquaintance
with
him
and
learned
that
valentin
was
still
sleeping
the
surgeon
who
had
had
a
fairly
tranquil
night
was
at
present
sitting
with
him
before
de
grosjoyaux
s
associate
reappeared
newman
learned
that
his
name
was
ledoux
and
that
bellegarde
s
acquaintance
with
him
dated
from
the
days
when
they
served
together
in
the
pontifical
zouaves
ledoux
was
the
nephew
of
a
distinguished
ultramontane
bishop
at
last
the
bishop
s
nephew
came
in
with
a
toilet
in
which
an
ingenious
attempt
at
harmony
with
the
peculiar
situation
was
visible
and
with
a
gravity
tempered
by
a
decent
deference
to
the
best
breakfast
that
the
croix
helvétique
had
ever
set
forth
valentin
s
servant
who
was
allowed
only
in
scanty
measure
the
honor
of
watching
with
his
master
had
been
lending
a
light
parisian
hand
in
the
kitchen
the
two
frenchmen
did
their
best
to
prove
that
if
circumstances
might
overshadow
they
could
not
really
obscure
the
national
talent
for
conversation
and
ledoux
delivered
a
neat
little
eulogy
on
poor
bellegarde
whom
he
pronounced
the
most
charming
englishman
he
had
ever
known
do
you
call
him
an
englishman
newman
asked
ledoux
smiled
a
moment
and
then
made
an
epigram
c
est
plus
qu
un
anglais
c
est
un
anglomane
newman
said
soberly
that
he
had
never
noticed
it
and
de
grosjoyaux
remarked
that
it
was
really
too
soon
to
deliver
a
funeral
oration
upon
poor
bellegarde
evidently
said
ledoux
but
i
couldn
t
help
observing
this
morning
to
newman
that
when
a
man
has
taken
such
excellent
measures
for
his
salvation
as
our
dear
friend
did
last
evening
it
seems
almost
a
pity
he
should
put
it
in
peril
again
by
returning
to
the
ledoux
was
a
great
catholic
and
newman
thought
him
a
queer
mixture
his
countenance
by
daylight
had
a
sort
of
amiably
saturnine
cast
he
had
a
very
large
thin
nose
and
looked
like
a
spanish
picture
he
appeared
to
think
dueling
a
very
perfect
arrangement
provided
if
one
should
get
hit
one
could
promptly
see
the
priest
he
seemed
to
take
a
great
satisfaction
in
valentin
s
interview
with
the
curé
and
yet
his
conversation
did
not
at
all
indicate
a
sanctimonious
habit
of
mind
ledoux
had
evidently
a
high
sense
of
the
becoming
and
was
prepared
to
be
urbane
and
tasteful
on
all
points
he
was
always
furnished
with
a
smile
which
pushed
his
moustache
up
under
his
nose
and
an
explanation
knowing
how
to
live
was
his
specialty
in
which
he
included
knowing
how
to
die
but
as
newman
reflected
with
a
good
deal
of
dumb
irritation
he
seemed
disposed
to
delegate
to
others
the
application
of
his
learning
on
this
latter
point
de
grosjoyaux
was
of
quite
another
complexion
and
appeared
to
regard
his
friend
s
theological
unction
as
the
sign
of
an
inaccessibly
superior
mind
he
was
evidently
doing
his
utmost
with
a
kind
of
jovial
tenderness
to
make
life
agreeable
to
valentin
to
the
last
and
help
him
as
little
as
possible
to
miss
the
boulevard
des
italiens
but
what
chiefly
occupied
his
mind
was
the
mystery
of
a
bungling
brewer
s
son
making
so
neat
a
shot
he
himself
could
snuff
a
candle
and
yet
he
confessed
that
he
could
not
have
done
better
than
this
he
hastened
to
add
that
on
the
present
occasion
he
would
have
made
a
point
of
not
doing
so
well
it
was
not
an
occasion
for
that
sort
of
murderous
work
diable
he
would
have
picked
out
some
quiet
fleshy
spot
and
just
tapped
it
with
a
harmless
ball
stanislas
kapp
had
been
deplorably
but
really
when
the
world
had
come
to
that
pass
that
one
granted
a
meeting
to
a
brewer
s
son
this
was
de
grosjoyaux
s
nearest
approach
to
a
generalization
he
kept
looking
through
the
window
over
the
shoulder
of
ledoux
at
a
slender
tree
which
stood
at
the
end
of
a
lane
opposite
to
the
inn
and
seemed
to
be
measuring
its
distance
from
his
extended
arm
and
secretly
wishing
that
since
the
subject
had
been
introduced
propriety
did
not
forbid
a
little
speculative
newman
was
in
no
humor
to
enjoy
good
company
he
could
neither
eat
nor
talk
his
soul
was
sore
with
grief
and
anger
and
the
weight
of
his
double
sorrow
was
intolerable
he
sat
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
his
plate
counting
the
minutes
wishing
at
one
moment
that
valentin
would
see
him
and
leave
him
free
to
go
in
quest
of
madame
de
cintré
and
his
lost
happiness
and
mentally
calling
himself
a
vile
brute
the
next
for
the
impatient
egotism
of
the
wish
he
was
very
poor
company
himself
and
even
his
acute
preoccupation
and
his
general
lack
of
the
habit
of
pondering
the
impression
he
produced
did
not
prevent
him
from
reflecting
that
his
companions
must
be
puzzled
to
see
how
poor
bellegarde
came
to
take
such
a
fancy
to
this
taciturn
yankee
that
he
must
needs
have
him
at
his
after
breakfast
he
strolled
forth
alone
into
the
village
and
looked
at
the
fountain
the
geese
the
open
barn
doors
the
brown
bent
old
women
showing
their
hugely
darned
at
the
ends
of
their
sabots
and
the
beautiful
view
of
snowy
alps
and
purple
jura
at
either
end
of
the
little
street
the
day
was
brilliant
early
spring
was
in
the
air
and
in
the
sunshine
and
the
winter
s
damp
was
trickling
out
of
the
cottage
eaves
it
was
birth
and
brightness
for
all
nature
even
for
chirping
chickens
and
waddling
goslings
and
it
was
to
be
death
and
burial
for
poor
foolish
generous
delightful
bellegarde
newman
walked
as
far
as
the
village
church
and
went
into
the
small
graveyard
beside
it
where
he
sat
down
and
looked
at
the
awkward
tablets
which
were
planted
around
they
were
all
sordid
and
hideous
and
newman
could
feel
nothing
but
the
hardness
and
coldness
of
death
he
got
up
and
came
back
to
the
inn
where
he
found
ledoux
having
coffee
and
a
cigarette
at
a
little
green
table
which
he
had
caused
to
be
carried
into
the
small
garden
newman
learning
that
the
doctor
was
still
sitting
with
valentin
asked
ledoux
if
he
might
not
be
allowed
to
relieve
him
he
had
a
great
desire
to
be
useful
to
his
poor
friend
this
was
easily
arranged
the
doctor
was
very
glad
to
go
to
bed
he
was
a
youthful
and
rather
jaunty
practitioner
but
he
had
a
clever
face
and
the
ribbon
of
the
legion
of
honor
in
his
buttonhole
newman
listened
attentively
to
the
instructions
he
gave
him
before
retiring
and
took
mechanically
from
his
hand
a
small
volume
which
the
surgeon
recommended
as
a
help
to
wakefulness
and
which
turned
out
to
be
an
old
copy
of
les
liaisons
valentin
was
still
lying
with
his
eyes
closed
and
there
was
no
visible
change
in
his
condition
newman
sat
down
near
him
and
for
a
long
time
narrowly
watched
him
then
his
eyes
wandered
away
with
his
thoughts
upon
his
own
situation
and
rested
upon
the
chain
of
the
alps
disclosed
by
the
drawing
of
the
scant
white
cotton
curtain
of
the
window
through
which
the
sunshine
passed
and
lay
in
squares
upon
the
floor
he
tried
to
interweave
his
reflections
with
hope
but
he
only
half
succeeded
what
had
happened
to
him
seemed
to
have
in
its
violence
and
audacity
the
force
of
a
real
calamity
the
strength
and
insolence
of
destiny
herself
it
was
unnatural
and
monstrous
and
he
had
no
arms
against
it
at
last
a
sound
struck
upon
the
stillness
and
he
heard
valentin
s
voice
it
can
t
be
about
you
are
pulling
that
long
face
he
found
when
he
turned
that
valentin
was
lying
in
the
same
position
but
his
eyes
were
open
and
he
was
even
trying
to
smile
it
was
with
a
very
slender
strength
that
he
returned
the
pressure
of
newman
s
hand
i
have
been
watching
you
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
valentin
went
on
you
have
been
looking
as
black
as
thunder
you
are
greatly
disgusted
with
me
i
see
well
of
course
so
am
i
oh
i
shall
not
scold
you
said
newman
i
feel
too
badly
and
how
are
you
getting
on
oh
i
m
getting
off
they
have
quite
settled
that
haven
t
they
that
s
for
you
to
settle
you
can
get
well
if
you
try
said
newman
with
resolute
cheerfulness
my
dear
fellow
how
can
i
try
trying
is
violent
exercise
and
that
sort
of
thing
isn
t
in
order
for
a
man
with
a
hole
in
his
side
as
big
as
your
hat
that
begins
to
bleed
if
he
moves
a
hair
i
knew
you
would
come
he
continued
i
knew
i
should
wake
up
and
find
you
here
so
i
m
not
surprised
but
last
night
i
was
very
impatient
i
didn
t
see
how
i
could
keep
still
until
you
came
it
was
a
matter
of
keeping
still
just
like
this
as
still
as
a
mummy
in
his
case
you
talk
about
trying
i
tried
that
well
here
i
am
yet
these
twenty
hours
it
seems
like
twenty
bellegarde
talked
slowly
and
feebly
but
distinctly
enough
it
was
visible
however
that
he
was
in
extreme
pain
and
at
last
he
closed
his
eyes
newman
begged
him
to
remain
silent
and
spare
himself
the
doctor
had
left
urgent
orders
oh
said
valentin
let
us
eat
and
drink
for
and
he
paused
again
no
not
perhaps
but
i
can
t
eat
and
drink
but
i
can
talk
what
s
to
be
gained
at
this
pass
by
renun
renunciation
i
mustn
t
use
such
big
words
i
was
always
a
chatterer
lord
how
i
have
talked
in
my
day
that
s
a
reason
for
keeping
quiet
now
said
newman
we
know
how
well
you
talk
you
but
valentin
without
heeding
him
went
on
in
the
same
weak
dying
drawl
i
wanted
to
see
you
because
you
have
seen
my
sister
does
she
know
will
she
come
newman
was
embarrassed
yes
by
this
time
she
must
didn
t
you
tell
her
valentin
asked
and
then
in
a
moment
didn
t
you
bring
me
any
message
from
her
his
eyes
rested
upon
newman
s
with
a
certain
soft
keenness
i
didn
t
see
her
after
i
got
your
telegram
said
newman
i
wrote
to
and
she
sent
you
no
answer
newman
was
obliged
to
reply
that
madame
de
cintré
had
left
paris
she
went
yesterday
to
yesterday
to
fleurières
why
did
she
go
to
fleurières
what
day
is
this
what
day
was
yesterday
ah
then
i
shan
t
see
her
said
valentin
sadly
fleurières
is
too
far
and
then
he
closed
his
eyes
again
newman
sat
silent
summoning
pious
invention
to
his
aid
but
he
was
relieved
at
finding
that
valentin
was
apparently
too
weak
to
reason
or
to
be
curious
bellegarde
however
presently
went
on
and
my
mother
and
my
brother
will
they
come
are
they
at
fleurières
they
were
in
paris
but
i
didn
t
see
them
either
newman
answered
if
they
received
your
telegram
in
time
they
will
have
started
this
morning
otherwise
they
will
be
obliged
to
wait
for
the
and
they
will
arrive
at
the
same
hour
as
i
they
won
t
thank
me
they
won
t
thank
me
valentin
murmured
they
will
pass
an
atrocious
night
and
urbain
doesn
t
like
the
early
morning
air
i
don
t
remember
ever
in
my
life
to
have
seen
him
before
noon
before
breakfast
no
one
ever
saw
him
we
don
t
know
how
he
is
then
perhaps
he
s
different
who
knows
posterity
perhaps
will
know
that
s
the
time
he
works
in
his
at
the
history
of
the
princesses
but
i
had
to
send
for
them
hadn
t
i
and
then
i
want
to
see
my
mother
sit
there
where
you
sit
and
say
to
her
perhaps
after
all
i
don
t
know
her
and
she
will
have
some
surprise
for
me
don
t
think
you
know
her
yet
yourself
perhaps
she
may
surprise
but
if
i
can
t
see
claire
i
don
t
care
for
anything
i
have
been
thinking
of
it
and
in
my
dreams
too
why
did
she
go
to
fleurières
she
never
told
me
what
has
happened
ah
she
ought
to
have
guessed
i
was
here
this
way
it
is
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
ever
disappointed
me
poor
claire
you
know
we
are
not
man
and
wife
quite
yet
your
sister
and
i
said
newman
she
doesn
t
yet
account
to
me
for
all
her
and
after
a
fashion
he
smiled
valentin
looked
at
him
a
moment
have
you
quarreled
never
never
never
newman
exclaimed
how
happily
you
say
that
said
valentin
you
are
going
to
be
happy
in
answer
to
this
stroke
of
irony
none
the
less
powerful
for
being
so
unconscious
all
poor
newman
could
do
was
to
give
a
helpless
and
transparent
stare
valentin
continued
to
fix
him
with
his
own
rather
gaze
and
presently
he
said
but
something
the
matter
with
you
i
watched
you
just
now
you
haven
t
a
bridegroom
s
my
dear
fellow
said
newman
how
can
i
show
a
bridegroom
s
face
if
you
think
i
enjoy
seeing
you
lie
there
and
not
being
able
to
help
you
why
you
are
just
the
man
to
be
cheerful
don
t
forfeit
your
rights
i
m
a
proof
of
your
wisdom
when
was
a
man
ever
gloomy
when
he
could
say
i
told
you
so
you
told
me
so
you
know
you
did
what
you
could
about
it
you
said
some
very
good
things
i
have
thought
them
over
but
my
dear
friend
i
was
right
all
the
same
this
is
the
regular
i
didn
t
do
what
i
ought
said
newman
i
ought
to
have
done
something
for
instance
oh
something
or
other
i
ought
to
have
treated
you
as
a
small
well
i
m
a
very
small
boy
now
said
valentin
i
m
rather
less
than
an
infant
an
infant
is
helpless
but
it
s
generally
voted
promising
i
m
not
promising
eh
society
can
t
lose
a
less
valuable
newman
was
strongly
moved
he
got
up
and
turned
his
back
upon
his
friend
and
walked
away
to
the
window
where
he
stood
looking
out
but
only
vaguely
seeing
no
i
don
t
like
the
look
of
your
back
valentin
continued
i
have
always
been
an
observer
of
backs
yours
is
quite
out
of
newman
returned
to
his
bedside
and
begged
him
to
be
quiet
be
quiet
and
get
well
he
said
that
s
what
you
must
do
get
well
and
help
i
told
you
you
were
in
trouble
how
can
i
help
you
valentin
asked
i
ll
let
you
know
when
you
are
better
you
were
always
curious
there
is
something
to
get
well
for
newman
answered
with
resolute
animation
valentin
closed
his
eyes
and
lay
a
long
time
without
speaking
he
seemed
even
to
have
fallen
asleep
but
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
he
began
to
talk
again
i
am
rather
sorry
about
that
place
in
the
bank
who
knows
but
that
i
might
have
become
another
rothschild
but
i
wasn
t
meant
for
a
banker
bankers
are
not
so
easy
to
kill
don
t
you
think
i
have
been
very
easy
to
kill
it
s
not
like
a
serious
man
it
s
really
very
mortifying
it
s
like
telling
your
hostess
you
must
go
when
you
count
upon
her
begging
you
to
stay
and
then
finding
she
does
no
such
thing
really
so
soon
you
ve
only
just
come
life
doesn
t
make
me
any
such
polite
little
newman
for
some
time
said
nothing
but
at
last
he
broke
out
it
s
a
bad
case
it
s
a
bad
case
it
s
the
worst
case
i
ever
met
i
don
t
want
to
say
anything
unpleasant
but
i
can
t
help
it
i
ve
seen
men
dying
before
and
i
ve
seen
men
shot
but
it
always
seemed
more
natural
they
were
not
so
clever
as
you
damnation
damnation
you
might
have
done
something
better
than
this
it
s
about
the
meanest
of
a
man
s
affairs
that
i
can
imagine
valentin
feebly
waved
his
hand
to
and
fro
don
t
insist
don
t
insist
it
is
mean
decidedly
mean
for
you
see
at
the
bottom
down
at
the
bottom
in
a
little
place
as
small
as
the
end
of
a
wine
funnel
i
agree
with
you
a
few
moments
after
this
the
doctor
put
his
head
through
the
door
and
perceiving
that
valentin
was
awake
came
in
and
felt
his
pulse
he
shook
his
head
and
declared
that
he
had
talked
too
much
ten
times
too
much
nonsense
said
valentin
a
man
sentenced
to
death
can
never
talk
too
much
have
you
never
read
an
account
of
an
execution
in
a
newspaper
don
t
they
always
set
a
lot
of
people
at
the
prisoner
lawyers
reporters
priests
to
make
him
talk
but
it
s
not
newman
s
fault
he
sits
there
as
mum
as
a
death
the
doctor
observed
that
it
was
time
his
patient
s
wound
should
be
dressed
again
mm
de
grosjoyaux
and
ledoux
who
had
already
witnessed
this
delicate
operation
taking
newman
s
place
as
assistants
newman
withdrew
and
learned
from
his
that
they
had
received
a
telegram
from
urbain
de
bellegarde
to
the
effect
that
their
message
had
been
delivered
in
the
rue
de
l
université
too
late
to
allow
him
to
take
the
morning
train
but
that
he
would
start
with
his
mother
in
the
evening
newman
wandered
away
into
the
village
again
and
walked
about
restlessly
for
two
or
three
hours
the
day
seemed
terribly
long
at
dusk
he
came
back
and
dined
with
the
doctor
and
ledoux
the
dressing
of
valentin
s
wound
had
been
a
very
critical
operation
the
doctor
didn
t
really
see
how
he
was
to
endure
a
repetition
of
it
he
then
declared
that
he
must
beg
of
newman
to
deny
himself
for
the
present
the
satisfaction
of
sitting
with
de
bellegarde
more
than
anyone
else
apparently
he
had
the
flattering
but
inconvenient
privilege
of
exciting
him
ledoux
at
this
swallowed
a
glass
of
wine
in
silence
he
must
have
been
wondering
what
the
deuce
bellegarde
found
so
exciting
in
the
american
newman
after
dinner
went
up
to
his
room
where
he
sat
for
a
long
time
staring
at
his
lighted
candle
and
thinking
that
valentin
was
dying
downstairs
late
when
the
candle
had
burnt
low
there
came
a
soft
rap
at
his
door
the
doctor
stood
there
with
a
candlestick
and
a
shrug
he
must
amuse
himself
still
said
valentin
s
medical
adviser
he
insists
upon
seeing
you
and
i
am
afraid
you
must
come
i
think
at
this
rate
that
he
will
hardly
outlast
the
newman
went
back
to
valentin
s
room
which
he
found
lighted
by
a
taper
on
the
hearth
valentin
begged
him
to
light
a
candle
i
want
to
see
your
face
he
said
they
say
you
excite
me
he
went
on
as
newman
complied
with
this
request
and
i
confess
i
do
feel
excited
but
it
isn
t
you
it
s
my
own
thoughts
i
have
been
thinking
thinking
sit
down
there
and
let
me
look
at
you
newman
seated
himself
folded
his
arms
and
bent
a
heavy
gaze
upon
his
friend
he
seemed
to
be
playing
a
part
mechanically
in
a
lugubrious
comedy
valentin
looked
at
him
for
some
time
yes
this
morning
i
was
right
you
have
something
on
your
mind
heavier
than
valentin
de
bellegarde
come
i
m
a
dying
man
and
it
s
indecent
to
deceive
me
something
happened
after
i
left
paris
it
was
not
for
nothing
that
my
sister
started
off
at
this
season
of
the
year
for
fleurières
why
was
it
it
sticks
in
my
crop
i
have
been
thinking
it
over
and
if
you
don
t
tell
me
i
shall
i
had
better
not
tell
you
said
newman
it
won
t
do
you
any
if
you
think
it
will
do
me
any
good
not
to
tell
me
you
are
very
much
mistaken
there
is
trouble
about
your
yes
said
newman
there
is
trouble
about
my
good
and
valentin
was
silent
again
they
have
stopped
they
have
stopped
it
said
newman
now
that
he
had
spoken
out
he
found
a
satisfaction
in
it
which
deepened
as
he
went
on
your
mother
and
brother
have
broken
faith
they
have
decided
that
it
can
t
take
place
they
have
decided
that
i
am
not
good
enough
after
all
they
have
taken
back
their
word
since
you
insist
there
it
is
valentin
gave
a
sort
of
groan
lifted
his
hands
a
moment
and
then
let
them
drop
i
am
sorry
not
to
have
anything
better
to
tell
you
about
them
newman
pursued
but
it
s
not
my
fault
i
was
indeed
very
unhappy
when
your
telegram
reached
me
i
was
quite
upside
down
you
may
imagine
whether
i
feel
any
better
valentin
moaned
gaspingly
as
if
his
wound
were
throbbing
broken
faith
broken
faith
he
murmured
and
my
sister
my
sister
your
sister
is
very
unhappy
she
has
consented
to
give
me
up
i
don
t
know
why
i
don
t
know
what
they
have
done
to
her
it
must
be
something
pretty
bad
in
justice
to
her
you
ought
to
know
it
they
have
made
her
suffer
i
haven
t
seen
her
alone
but
only
before
them
we
had
an
interview
yesterday
morning
they
came
out
flat
in
so
many
words
they
told
me
to
go
about
my
business
it
seems
to
me
a
very
bad
case
i
m
angry
i
m
sore
i
m
valentin
lay
there
staring
with
his
eyes
more
brilliantly
lighted
his
lips
soundlessly
parted
and
a
flush
of
color
in
his
pale
face
newman
had
never
before
uttered
so
many
words
in
the
plaintive
key
but
now
in
speaking
to
valentin
in
the
poor
fellow
s
extremity
he
had
a
feeling
that
he
was
making
his
complaint
somewhere
within
the
presence
of
the
power
that
men
pray
to
in
trouble
he
felt
his
outgush
of
resentment
as
a
sort
of
spiritual
privilege
and
claire
said
bellegarde
claire
she
has
given
you
up
i
don
t
really
believe
it
said
newman
no
don
t
believe
it
don
t
believe
it
she
is
gaining
time
excuse
i
pity
her
said
newman
poor
claire
murmured
valentin
but
they
but
they
and
he
paused
again
you
saw
them
they
dismissed
you
face
to
face
face
to
face
they
were
very
what
did
they
say
they
said
they
couldn
t
stand
a
commercial
valentin
put
out
his
hand
and
laid
it
upon
newman
s
arm
and
about
their
promise
their
engagement
with
you
they
made
a
distinction
they
said
it
was
to
hold
good
only
until
madame
de
cintré
accepted
valentin
lay
staring
a
while
and
his
flush
died
away
don
t
tell
me
any
more
he
said
at
last
i
m
you
you
are
the
soul
of
honor
said
newman
simply
valentin
groaned
and
turned
away
his
head
for
some
time
nothing
more
was
said
then
valentin
turned
back
again
and
found
a
certain
force
to
press
newman
s
arm
it
s
very
bad
very
bad
when
my
people
when
my
race
come
to
that
it
is
time
for
me
to
withdraw
i
believe
in
my
sister
she
will
explain
excuse
her
if
she
can
t
if
she
can
t
forgive
her
she
has
suffered
but
for
the
others
it
is
very
bad
very
bad
you
take
it
very
hard
no
it
s
a
shame
to
make
you
say
he
closed
his
eyes
and
again
there
was
a
silence
newman
felt
almost
awed
he
had
evoked
a
more
solemn
spirit
than
he
expected
presently
valentin
looked
at
him
again
removing
his
hand
from
his
arm
i
apologize
he
said
do
you
understand
here
on
my
i
apologize
for
my
family
for
my
mother
for
my
brother
for
the
ancient
house
of
bellegarde
he
added
softly
newman
for
an
answer
took
his
hand
and
pressed
it
with
a
world
of
kindness
valentin
remained
quiet
and
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
the
doctor
softly
came
in
behind
him
through
the
door
newman
saw
the
two
questioning
faces
of
mm
de
grosjoyaux
and
ledoux
the
doctor
laid
his
hand
on
valentin
s
wrist
and
sat
looking
at
him
he
gave
no
sign
and
the
two
gentlemen
came
in
ledoux
having
first
beckoned
to
someone
outside
this
was
le
curé
who
carried
in
his
hand
an
object
unknown
to
newman
and
covered
with
a
white
napkin
le
curé
was
short
round
and
red
he
advanced
pulling
off
his
little
black
cap
to
newman
and
deposited
his
burden
on
the
table
and
then
he
sat
down
in
the
best
armchair
with
his
hands
folded
across
his
person
the
other
gentlemen
had
exchanged
glances
which
expressed
unanimity
as
to
the
timeliness
of
their
presence
but
for
a
long
time
valentin
neither
spoke
nor
moved
it
was
newman
s
belief
afterwards
that
le
curé
went
to
sleep
at
last
abruptly
valentin
pronounced
newman
s
name
his
friend
went
to
him
and
he
said
in
french
you
are
not
alone
i
want
to
speak
to
you
newman
looked
at
the
doctor
and
the
doctor
looked
at
the
curé
who
looked
back
at
him
and
then
the
doctor
and
the
curé
together
gave
a
shrug
alone
for
five
minutes
valentin
repeated
please
leave
the
curé
took
up
his
burden
again
and
led
the
way
out
followed
by
his
companions
newman
closed
the
door
behind
them
and
came
back
to
valentin
s
bedside
bellegarde
had
watched
all
this
intently
it
s
very
bad
it
s
very
bad
he
said
after
newman
had
seated
himself
close
to
him
the
more
i
think
of
it
the
worse
it
oh
don
t
think
of
it
said
newman
but
valentin
went
on
without
heeding
him
even
if
they
should
come
round
again
the
shame
the
baseness
is
oh
they
won
t
come
round
said
newman
well
you
can
make
make
them
i
can
tell
you
something
a
great
secret
an
immense
secret
you
can
use
it
against
them
frighten
them
force
a
secret
newman
repeated
the
idea
of
letting
valentin
on
his
confide
him
an
immense
secret
shocked
him
for
the
moment
and
made
him
draw
back
it
seemed
an
illicit
way
of
arriving
at
information
and
even
had
a
vague
analogy
with
listening
at
a
keyhole
then
suddenly
the
thought
of
forcing
madame
de
bellegarde
and
her
son
became
attractive
and
newman
bent
his
head
closer
to
valentin
s
lips
for
some
time
however
the
dying
man
said
nothing
more
he
only
lay
and
looked
at
his
friend
with
his
kindled
expanded
troubled
eye
and
newman
began
to
believe
that
he
had
spoken
in
delirium
but
at
last
he
said
there
was
something
done
something
done
at
fleurières
it
was
foul
play
my
father
something
happened
to
him
i
don
t
know
i
have
been
ashamed
afraid
to
know
but
i
know
there
is
something
my
mother
knows
urbain
something
happened
to
your
father
said
newman
urgently
valentin
looked
at
him
still
more
he
didn
t
get
get
well
of
what
but
the
immense
effort
which
valentin
had
made
first
to
decide
to
utter
these
words
and
then
to
bring
them
out
appeared
to
have
taken
his
last
strength
he
lapsed
again
into
silence
and
newman
sat
watching
him
do
you
understand
he
began
again
presently
at
fleurières
you
can
find
out
mrs
bread
knows
tell
her
i
begged
you
to
ask
her
then
tell
them
that
and
see
it
may
help
you
if
not
tell
everyone
it
will
it
will
here
valentin
s
voice
sank
to
the
feeblest
murmur
it
will
avenge
you
the
words
died
away
in
a
long
soft
groan
newman
stood
up
deeply
impressed
not
knowing
what
to
say
his
heart
was
beating
violently
thank
you
he
said
at
last
i
am
much
but
valentin
seemed
not
to
hear
him
he
remained
silent
and
his
silence
continued
at
last
newman
went
and
opened
the
door
le
curé
bearing
his
sacred
vessel
and
followed
by
the
three
gentlemen
and
by
valentin
s
servant
it
was
almost
processional
chapter
xx
valentin
de
bellegarde
died
tranquilly
just
as
the
cold
faint
march
dawn
began
to
illumine
the
faces
of
the
little
knot
of
friends
gathered
about
his
bedside
an
hour
afterwards
newman
left
the
inn
and
drove
to
geneva
he
was
naturally
unwilling
to
be
present
at
the
arrival
of
madame
de
bellegarde
and
her
at
geneva
for
the
moment
he
remained
he
was
like
a
man
who
has
had
a
fall
and
wants
to
sit
still
and
count
his
bruises
he
instantly
wrote
to
madame
de
cintré
relating
to
her
the
circumstances
of
her
brother
s
death
with
certain
exceptions
and
asking
her
what
was
the
earliest
moment
at
which
he
might
hope
that
she
would
consent
to
see
him
ledoux
had
told
him
that
he
had
reason
to
know
that
valentin
s
will
bellegarde
had
a
great
deal
of
elegant
personal
property
to
dispose
of
contained
a
request
that
he
should
be
buried
near
his
father
in
the
churchyard
of
fleurières
and
newman
intended
that
the
state
of
his
own
relations
with
the
family
should
not
deprive
him
of
the
satisfaction
of
helping
to
pay
the
last
earthly
honors
to
the
best
fellow
in
the
world
he
reflected
that
valentin
s
friendship
was
older
than
urbain
s
enmity
and
that
at
a
funeral
it
was
easy
to
escape
notice
madame
de
cintré
s
answer
to
his
letter
enabled
him
to
time
his
arrival
at
fleurières
this
answer
was
very
brief
it
ran
as
follows
i
thank
you
for
your
letter
and
for
your
being
with
valentin
it
is
a
most
inexpressible
sorrow
to
me
that
i
was
not
to
see
you
will
be
nothing
but
a
distress
to
me
there
is
no
need
therefore
to
wait
for
what
you
call
brighter
days
it
is
all
one
now
and
i
shall
have
no
brighter
days
come
when
you
please
only
notify
me
first
my
brother
is
to
be
buried
here
on
friday
and
my
family
is
to
remain
here
de
as
soon
as
he
received
this
letter
newman
went
straight
to
paris
and
to
poitiers
the
journey
took
him
far
southward
through
green
touraine
and
across
the
loire
into
a
country
where
the
early
spring
deepened
about
him
as
he
went
but
he
had
never
made
a
journey
during
which
he
heeded
less
what
he
would
have
called
the
lay
of
the
land
he
obtained
lodging
at
the
inn
at
poitiers
and
the
next
morning
drove
in
a
couple
of
hours
to
the
village
of
fleurières
but
here
preoccupied
though
he
was
he
could
not
fail
to
notice
the
picturesqueness
of
the
place
it
was
what
the
french
call
a
it
lay
at
the
base
of
a
sort
of
huge
mound
on
the
summit
of
which
stood
the
crumbling
ruins
of
a
feudal
castle
much
of
whose
sturdy
material
as
well
as
that
of
the
wall
which
dropped
along
the
hill
to
enclose
the
clustered
houses
defensively
had
been
absorbed
into
the
very
substance
of
the
village
the
church
was
simply
the
former
chapel
of
the
castle
fronting
upon
its
court
which
however
was
of
generous
enough
width
to
have
given
up
its
quaintest
corner
to
a
little
graveyard
here
the
very
headstones
themselves
seemed
to
sleep
as
they
slanted
into
the
grass
the
patient
elbow
of
the
rampart
held
them
together
on
one
side
and
in
front
far
beneath
their
mossy
lids
the
green
plains
and
blue
distances
stretched
away
the
way
to
church
up
the
hill
was
impracticable
to
vehicles
it
was
lined
with
peasants
two
or
three
rows
deep
who
stood
watching
old
madame
de
bellegarde
slowly
ascend
it
on
the
arm
of
her
elder
son
behind
the
of
the
other
newman
chose
to
lurk
among
the
common
mourners
who
murmured
madame
la
comtesse
as
a
tall
figure
veiled
in
black
passed
before
them
he
stood
in
the
dusky
little
church
while
the
service
was
going
forward
but
at
the
dismal
he
turned
away
and
walked
down
the
hill
he
went
back
to
poitiers
and
spent
two
days
in
which
patience
and
impatience
were
singularly
commingled
on
the
third
day
he
sent
madame
de
cintré
a
note
saying
that
he
would
call
upon
her
in
the
afternoon
and
in
accordance
with
this
he
again
took
his
way
to
fleurières
he
left
his
vehicle
at
the
tavern
in
the
village
street
and
obeyed
the
simple
instructions
which
were
given
him
for
finding
the
château
it
is
just
beyond
there
said
the
landlord
and
pointed
to
the
of
the
park
above
the
opposite
houses
newman
followed
the
first
to
the
right
it
was
bordered
with
mouldy
cottages
and
in
a
few
moments
saw
before
him
the
peaked
roofs
of
the
towers
advancing
farther
he
found
himself
before
a
vast
iron
gate
rusty
and
closed
here
he
paused
a
moment
looking
through
the
bars
the
château
was
near
the
road
this
was
at
once
its
merit
and
its
defect
but
its
aspect
was
extremely
impressive
newman
learned
afterwards
from
a
of
the
province
that
it
dated
from
the
time
of
henry
iv
it
presented
to
the
wide
paved
area
which
preceded
it
and
which
was
edged
with
shabby
an
immense
façade
of
dark
brick
flanked
by
two
low
wings
each
of
which
terminated
in
a
little
pavilion
capped
with
a
fantastic
roof
two
towers
rose
behind
and
behind
the
towers
was
a
mass
of
elms
and
beeches
now
just
faintly
green
but
the
great
feature
was
a
wide
green
river
which
washed
the
foundations
of
the
château
the
building
rose
from
an
island
in
the
circling
stream
so
that
this
formed
a
perfect
moat
spanned
by
a
bridge
without
a
parapet
the
dull
brick
walls
which
here
and
there
made
a
grand
straight
sweep
the
ugly
little
cupolas
of
the
wings
the
windows
the
long
steep
pinnacles
of
mossy
slate
all
mirrored
themselves
in
the
tranquil
river
newman
rang
at
the
gate
and
was
almost
frightened
at
the
tone
with
which
a
big
rusty
bell
above
his
head
replied
to
him
an
old
woman
came
out
from
the
and
opened
the
creaking
portal
just
wide
enough
for
him
to
pass
and
he
went
in
across
the
dry
bare
court
and
the
little
cracked
white
slabs
of
the
causeway
on
the
moat
at
the
door
of
the
château
he
waited
for
some
moments
and
this
gave
him
a
chance
to
observe
that
fleurières
was
not
kept
up
and
to
reflect
that
it
was
a
melancholy
place
of
residence
it
looks
said
newman
to
himself
and
i
give
the
comparison
for
what
it
is
worth
like
a
chinese
at
last
the
door
was
opened
by
a
servant
whom
he
remembered
to
have
seen
in
the
rue
de
l
université
the
man
s
dull
face
brightened
as
he
perceived
our
hero
for
newman
for
indefinable
reasons
enjoyed
the
confidence
of
the
liveried
gentry
the
footman
led
the
way
across
a
great
central
vestibule
with
a
pyramid
of
plants
in
tubs
in
the
middle
of
glass
doors
all
around
to
what
appeared
to
be
the
principal
of
the
château
newman
crossed
the
threshold
of
a
room
of
superb
proportions
which
made
him
feel
at
first
like
a
tourist
with
a
and
a
cicerone
awaiting
a
fee
but
when
his
guide
had
left
him
alone
with
the
observation
that
he
would
call
madame
la
comtesse
newman
perceived
that
the
salon
contained
little
that
was
remarkable
save
a
dark
ceiling
with
curiously
carved
rafters
some
curtains
of
elaborate
antiquated
tapestry
and
a
dark
oaken
floor
polished
like
a
mirror
he
waited
some
minutes
walking
up
and
down
but
at
length
as
he
turned
at
the
end
of
the
room
he
saw
that
madame
de
cintré
had
come
in
by
a
distant
door
she
wore
a
black
dress
and
she
stood
looking
at
him
as
the
length
of
the
immense
room
lay
between
them
he
had
time
to
look
at
her
before
they
met
in
the
middle
of
it
he
was
dismayed
at
the
change
in
her
appearance
pale
almost
haggard
with
a
sort
of
monastic
rigidity
in
her
dress
she
had
little
but
her
pure
features
in
common
with
the
woman
whose
radiant
good
grace
he
had
hitherto
admired
she
let
her
eyes
rest
on
his
own
and
she
let
him
take
her
hand
but
her
eyes
looked
like
two
rainy
autumn
moons
and
her
touch
was
portentously
lifeless
i
was
at
your
brother
s
funeral
newman
said
then
i
waited
three
days
but
i
could
wait
no
nothing
can
be
lost
or
gained
by
waiting
said
madame
de
cintré
but
it
was
very
considerate
of
you
to
wait
wronged
as
you
have
i
m
glad
you
think
i
have
been
wronged
said
newman
with
that
oddly
humorous
accent
with
which
he
often
uttered
words
of
the
gravest
meaning
do
i
need
to
say
so
she
asked
i
don
t
think
i
have
wronged
seriously
many
persons
certainly
not
consciously
to
you
to
whom
i
have
done
this
hard
and
cruel
thing
the
only
reparation
i
can
make
is
to
say
i
know
it
i
feel
it
the
reparation
is
pitifully
small
oh
it
s
a
great
step
forward
said
newman
with
a
gracious
smile
of
encouragement
he
pushed
a
chair
towards
her
and
held
it
looking
at
her
urgently
she
sat
down
mechanically
and
he
seated
himself
near
her
but
in
a
moment
he
got
up
restlessly
and
stood
before
her
she
remained
seated
like
a
troubled
creature
who
had
passed
through
the
stage
of
restlessness
i
say
nothing
is
to
be
gained
by
my
seeing
you
she
went
on
and
yet
i
am
very
glad
you
came
now
i
can
tell
you
what
i
feel
it
is
a
selfish
pleasure
but
it
is
one
of
the
last
i
shall
and
she
paused
with
her
great
misty
eyes
fixed
upon
him
i
know
how
i
have
deceived
and
injured
you
i
know
how
cruel
and
cowardly
i
have
been
i
see
it
as
vividly
as
you
do
i
feel
it
to
the
ends
of
my
and
she
unclasped
her
hands
which
were
locked
together
in
her
lap
lifted
them
and
dropped
them
at
her
side
anything
that
you
may
have
said
of
me
in
your
angriest
passion
is
nothing
to
what
i
have
said
to
in
my
angriest
passion
said
newman
i
have
said
nothing
hard
of
you
the
very
worst
thing
i
have
said
of
you
yet
is
that
you
are
the
loveliest
of
and
he
seated
himself
before
her
again
abruptly
she
flushed
a
little
but
even
her
flush
was
pale
that
is
because
you
think
i
will
come
back
but
i
will
not
come
back
it
is
in
that
hope
you
have
come
here
i
know
i
am
very
sorry
for
you
i
would
do
almost
anything
for
you
to
say
that
after
what
i
have
done
seems
simply
impudent
but
what
can
i
say
that
will
not
seem
impudent
to
wrong
you
and
apologize
that
is
easy
enough
i
should
not
have
wronged
she
stopped
a
moment
looking
at
him
and
motioned
him
to
let
her
go
on
i
ought
never
to
have
listened
to
you
at
first
that
was
the
wrong
no
good
could
come
of
it
i
felt
it
and
yet
i
listened
that
was
your
fault
i
liked
you
too
much
i
believed
in
and
don
t
you
believe
in
me
now
more
than
ever
but
now
it
doesn
t
matter
i
have
given
you
newman
gave
a
powerful
thump
with
his
clenched
fist
upon
his
knee
why
why
why
he
cried
give
me
a
reason
a
decent
reason
you
are
not
a
child
you
are
not
a
minor
nor
an
idiot
you
are
not
obliged
to
drop
me
because
your
mother
told
you
to
such
a
reason
isn
t
worthy
of
i
know
that
it
s
not
worthy
of
me
but
it
s
the
only
one
i
have
to
give
after
all
said
madame
de
cintré
throwing
out
her
hands
think
me
an
idiot
and
forget
me
that
will
be
the
simplest
newman
got
up
and
walked
away
with
a
crushing
sense
that
his
cause
was
lost
and
yet
with
an
equal
inability
to
give
up
fighting
he
went
to
one
of
the
great
windows
and
looked
out
at
the
stiffly
embanked
river
and
the
formal
gardens
which
lay
beyond
it
when
he
turned
round
madame
de
cintré
had
risen
she
stood
there
silent
and
passive
you
are
not
frank
said
newman
you
are
not
honest
instead
of
saying
that
you
are
imbecile
you
should
say
that
other
people
are
wicked
your
mother
and
your
brother
have
been
false
and
cruel
they
have
been
so
to
me
and
i
am
sure
they
have
been
so
to
you
why
do
you
try
to
shield
them
why
do
you
sacrifice
me
to
them
i
m
not
false
i
m
not
cruel
you
don
t
know
what
you
give
up
i
can
tell
you
that
you
don
t
they
bully
you
and
plot
about
you
and
i
i
and
he
paused
holding
out
his
hands
she
turned
away
and
began
to
leave
him
you
told
me
the
other
day
that
you
were
afraid
of
your
mother
he
said
following
her
what
did
you
mean
madame
de
cintré
shook
her
head
i
remember
i
was
sorry
you
were
sorry
when
she
came
down
and
put
on
the
thumbscrews
in
god
s
name
what
it
she
does
to
you
nothing
nothing
that
you
can
understand
and
now
that
i
have
given
you
up
i
must
not
complain
of
her
to
that
s
no
reasoning
cried
newman
complain
of
her
on
the
contrary
tell
me
all
about
it
frankly
and
trustfully
as
you
ought
and
we
will
talk
it
over
so
satisfactorily
that
you
won
t
give
me
madame
de
cintré
looked
down
some
moments
fixedly
and
then
raising
her
eyes
she
said
one
good
at
least
has
come
of
this
i
have
made
you
judge
me
more
fairly
you
thought
of
me
in
a
way
that
did
me
great
honor
i
don
t
know
why
you
had
taken
it
into
your
head
but
it
left
me
no
loophole
for
escape
no
chance
to
be
the
common
weak
creature
i
am
it
was
not
my
fault
i
warned
you
from
the
first
but
i
ought
to
have
warned
you
more
i
ought
to
have
convinced
you
that
i
was
doomed
to
disappoint
you
but
i
in
a
way
too
proud
you
see
what
my
superiority
amounts
to
i
hope
she
went
on
raising
her
voice
with
a
tremor
which
even
then
and
there
newman
thought
beautiful
i
am
too
proud
to
be
honest
i
am
not
too
proud
to
be
faithless
i
am
timid
and
cold
and
selfish
i
am
afraid
of
being
and
you
call
marrying
me
uncomfortable
said
newman
staring
madame
de
cintré
blushed
a
little
and
seemed
to
say
that
if
begging
his
pardon
in
words
was
impudent
she
might
at
least
thus
mutely
express
her
perfect
comprehension
of
his
finding
her
conduct
odious
it
is
not
marrying
you
it
is
doing
all
that
would
go
with
it
it
s
the
rupture
the
defiance
the
insisting
upon
being
happy
in
my
own
way
what
right
have
i
to
be
happy
when
when
and
she
paused
when
what
said
newman
when
others
have
been
most
unhappy
what
others
newman
asked
what
have
you
to
do
with
any
others
but
me
besides
you
said
just
now
that
you
wanted
happiness
and
that
you
should
find
it
by
obeying
your
mother
you
contradict
yes
i
contradict
myself
that
shows
you
that
i
am
not
even
you
are
laughing
at
me
cried
newman
you
are
mocking
me
she
looked
at
him
intently
and
an
observer
might
have
said
that
she
was
asking
herself
whether
she
might
not
most
quickly
end
their
common
pain
by
confessing
that
she
was
mocking
him
no
i
am
not
she
presently
said
granting
that
you
are
not
intelligent
he
went
on
that
you
are
weak
that
you
are
common
that
you
are
nothing
that
i
have
believed
you
were
what
i
ask
of
you
is
not
heroic
effort
it
is
a
very
common
effort
there
is
a
great
deal
on
my
side
to
make
it
easy
the
simple
truth
is
that
you
don
t
care
enough
about
me
to
make
i
am
cold
said
madame
de
cintré
i
am
as
cold
as
that
flowing
newman
gave
a
great
rap
on
the
floor
with
his
stick
and
a
long
grim
laugh
good
good
he
cried
you
go
altogether
too
far
you
overshoot
the
mark
there
isn
t
a
woman
in
the
world
as
bad
as
you
would
make
yourself
out
i
see
your
game
it
s
what
i
said
you
are
blackening
yourself
to
whiten
others
you
don
t
want
to
give
me
up
at
all
you
like
me
you
like
me
i
know
you
do
you
have
shown
it
and
i
have
felt
it
after
that
you
may
be
as
cold
as
you
please
they
have
bullied
you
i
say
they
have
tortured
you
it
s
an
outrage
and
i
insist
upon
saving
you
from
the
extravagance
of
your
own
generosity
would
you
chop
off
your
hand
if
your
mother
requested
it
madame
de
cintré
looked
a
little
frightened
i
spoke
of
my
mother
too
blindly
the
other
day
i
am
my
own
mistress
by
law
and
by
her
approval
she
can
do
nothing
to
me
she
has
done
nothing
she
has
never
alluded
to
those
hard
words
i
used
about
she
has
made
you
feel
them
i
ll
promise
you
said
newman
it
s
my
conscience
that
makes
me
feel
your
conscience
seems
to
me
to
be
rather
mixed
exclaimed
newman
passionately
it
has
been
in
great
trouble
but
now
it
is
very
clear
said
madame
de
cintré
i
don
t
give
you
up
for
any
worldly
advantage
or
for
any
worldly
oh
you
don
t
give
me
up
for
lord
deepmere
i
know
said
newman
i
won
t
pretend
even
to
provoke
you
that
i
think
that
but
that
s
what
your
mother
and
your
brother
wanted
and
your
mother
at
that
villainous
ball
of
hers
i
liked
it
at
the
time
but
the
very
thought
of
it
now
makes
me
rabid
tried
to
push
him
on
to
make
up
to
who
told
you
this
said
madame
de
cintré
softly
not
valentin
i
observed
it
i
guessed
it
i
didn
t
know
at
the
time
that
i
was
observing
it
but
it
stuck
in
my
memory
and
afterwards
you
recollect
i
saw
lord
deepmere
with
you
in
the
conservatory
you
said
then
that
you
would
tell
me
at
another
time
what
he
had
said
to
that
was
before
before
said
madame
de
cintré
it
doesn
t
matter
said
newman
and
besides
i
think
i
know
he
s
an
honest
little
englishman
he
came
and
told
you
what
your
mother
was
up
to
that
she
wanted
him
to
supplant
me
not
being
a
commercial
person
if
he
would
make
you
an
offer
she
would
undertake
to
bring
you
over
and
give
me
the
slip
lord
deepmere
isn
t
very
intellectual
so
she
had
to
spell
it
out
to
him
he
said
he
admired
you
no
end
and
that
he
wanted
you
to
know
it
but
he
didn
t
like
being
mixed
up
with
that
sort
of
underhand
work
and
he
came
to
you
and
told
tales
that
was
about
the
amount
of
it
wasn
t
it
and
then
you
said
you
were
perfectly
i
don
t
see
why
we
should
talk
of
lord
deepmere
said
madame
de
cintré
it
was
not
for
that
you
came
here
and
about
my
mother
it
doesn
t
matter
what
you
suspect
and
what
you
know
when
once
my
mind
has
been
made
up
as
it
is
now
i
should
not
discuss
these
things
discussing
anything
now
is
very
idle
we
must
try
and
live
each
as
we
can
i
believe
you
will
be
happy
again
even
sometimes
when
you
think
of
me
when
you
do
so
think
this
that
it
was
not
easy
and
that
i
did
the
best
i
could
i
have
things
to
reckon
with
that
you
don
t
know
i
mean
i
have
feelings
i
must
do
as
they
force
me
i
must
i
must
they
would
haunt
me
otherwise
she
cried
with
vehemence
they
would
kill
me
i
know
what
your
feelings
are
they
are
superstitions
they
are
the
feeling
that
after
all
though
i
a
good
fellow
i
have
been
in
business
the
feeling
that
your
mother
s
looks
are
law
and
your
brother
s
words
are
gospel
that
you
all
hang
together
and
that
it
s
a
part
of
the
everlasting
proprieties
that
they
should
have
a
hand
in
everything
you
do
it
makes
my
blood
boil
that
cold
you
are
right
and
what
i
feel
here
and
newman
struck
his
heart
and
became
more
poetical
than
he
knew
is
a
glowing
fire
a
spectator
less
preoccupied
than
madame
de
cintré
s
distracted
wooer
would
have
felt
sure
from
the
first
that
her
appealing
calm
of
manner
was
the
result
of
violent
effort
in
spite
of
which
the
tide
of
agitation
was
rapidly
rising
on
these
last
words
of
newman
s
it
overflowed
though
at
first
she
spoke
low
for
fear
of
her
voice
betraying
her
no
i
was
not
right
i
am
not
cold
i
believe
that
if
i
am
doing
what
seems
so
bad
it
is
not
mere
weakness
and
falseness
newman
it
s
like
a
religion
i
can
t
tell
you
i
can
t
it
s
cruel
of
you
to
insist
i
don
t
see
why
i
shouldn
t
ask
you
to
believe
me
and
pity
me
it
s
like
a
religion
there
s
a
curse
upon
the
house
i
don
t
know
what
i
don
t
know
why
don
t
ask
me
we
must
all
bear
it
i
have
been
too
selfish
i
wanted
to
escape
from
it
you
offered
me
a
great
chance
besides
my
liking
you
it
seemed
good
to
change
completely
to
break
to
go
away
and
then
i
admired
you
but
i
can
t
it
has
overtaken
and
come
back
to
her
had
now
completely
abandoned
her
and
her
words
were
broken
with
long
sobs
why
do
such
dreadful
things
happen
to
us
why
is
my
brother
valentin
killed
like
a
beast
in
the
midst
of
his
youth
and
his
gaiety
and
his
brightness
and
all
that
we
loved
him
for
why
are
there
things
i
can
t
ask
about
that
i
am
afraid
to
know
why
are
there
places
i
can
t
look
at
sounds
i
can
t
hear
why
is
it
given
to
me
to
choose
to
decide
in
a
case
so
hard
and
so
terrible
as
this
i
am
not
meant
for
that
i
am
not
made
for
boldness
and
defiance
i
was
made
to
be
happy
in
a
quiet
natural
at
this
newman
gave
a
most
expressive
groan
but
madame
de
cintré
went
on
i
was
made
to
do
gladly
and
gratefully
what
is
expected
of
me
my
mother
has
always
been
very
good
to
me
that
s
all
i
can
say
i
must
not
judge
her
i
must
not
criticize
her
if
i
did
it
would
come
back
to
me
i
can
t
change
no
said
newman
bitterly
must
change
if
i
break
in
two
in
the
effort
you
are
different
you
are
a
man
you
will
get
over
it
you
have
all
kinds
of
consolation
you
were
born
you
were
trained
to
changes
besides
besides
i
shall
always
think
of
i
don
t
care
for
that
cried
newman
you
are
cruel
you
are
terribly
cruel
god
forgive
you
you
may
have
the
best
reasons
and
the
finest
feelings
in
the
world
that
makes
no
difference
you
are
a
mystery
to
me
i
don
t
see
how
such
hardness
can
go
with
such
madame
de
cintré
fixed
him
a
moment
with
her
swimming
eyes
you
believe
i
am
hard
then
newman
answered
her
look
and
then
broke
out
you
are
a
perfect
faultless
creature
stay
by
me
of
course
i
am
hard
she
went
on
whenever
we
give
pain
we
are
hard
and
we
give
pain
that
s
the
world
the
hateful
miserable
world
ah
and
she
gave
a
long
deep
sigh
i
can
t
even
say
i
am
glad
to
have
known
you
though
i
am
that
too
is
to
wrong
you
i
can
say
nothing
that
is
not
cruel
therefore
let
us
part
without
more
of
this
and
she
put
out
her
hand
newman
stood
and
looked
at
it
without
taking
it
and
raised
his
eyes
to
her
face
he
felt
himself
like
shedding
tears
of
rage
what
are
you
going
to
do
he
asked
where
are
you
going
where
i
shall
give
no
more
pain
and
suspect
no
more
evil
i
am
going
out
of
the
out
of
the
world
i
am
going
into
a
into
a
convent
newman
repeated
the
words
with
the
deepest
dismay
it
was
as
if
she
had
said
she
was
going
into
an
hospital
into
a
convent
i
told
you
that
it
was
not
for
my
worldly
advantage
or
pleasure
i
was
leaving
but
still
newman
hardly
understood
you
are
going
to
be
a
nun
he
went
on
in
a
cell
for
life
with
a
gown
and
white
veil
a
nun
a
carmelite
nun
said
madame
de
cintré
for
life
with
god
s
the
idea
struck
newman
as
too
dark
and
horrible
for
belief
and
made
him
feel
as
he
would
have
done
if
she
had
told
him
that
she
was
going
to
mutilate
her
beautiful
face
or
drink
some
potion
that
would
make
her
mad
he
clasped
his
hands
and
began
to
tremble
visibly
madame
de
cintré
don
t
don
t
he
said
i
beseech
you
on
my
knees
if
you
like
i
ll
beseech
she
laid
her
hand
upon
his
arm
with
a
tender
pitying
almost
reassuring
gesture
you
don
t
understand
she
said
you
have
wrong
ideas
it
s
nothing
horrible
it
is
only

it
is
to
be
out
of
the
world
where
such
troubles
as
this
come
to
the
innocent
to
the
best
and
for
life

newman
dropped
into
a
chair
and
sat
looking
at
her
with
a
long
inarticulate
murmur
that
this
superb
woman
in
whom
he
had
seen
all
human
grace
and
household
force
should
turn
from
him
and
all
the
brightness
that
he
offered
her
him
and
his
future
and
his
fortune
and
his
fidelity
to
muffle
herself
in
ascetic
rags
and
entomb
herself
in
a
cell
was
a
confounding
combination
of
the
inexorable
and
the
grotesque
as
the
image
deepened
before
him
the
grotesque
seemed
to
expand
and
overspread
it
it
was
a
reduction
to
the
absurd
of
the
trial
to
which
he
was
subjected
you
you
a
nun
he
exclaimed
you
with
your
beauty
defaced
you
behind
locks
and
bars
never
never
if
i
can
prevent
it
and
he
sprang
to
his
feet
with
a
violent
laugh
you
can
t
prevent
it
said
madame
de
cintré
and
it
ought
a
little
to
satisfy
you
do
you
suppose
i
will
go
on
living
in
the
world
still
beside
you
and
yet
not
with
you
it
is
all
arranged
this
time
he
took
her
hand
took
it
in
both
his
own
forever
he
said
her
lips
made
an
inaudible
movement
and
his
own
uttered
a
deep
imprecation
she
closed
her
eyes
as
if
with
the
pain
of
hearing
it
then
he
drew
her
towards
him
and
clasped
her
to
his
breast
he
kissed
her
white
face
for
an
instant
she
resisted
and
for
a
moment
she
submitted
then
with
force
she
disengaged
herself
and
hurried
away
over
the
long
shining
floor
the
next
moment
the
door
closed
behind
her
newman
made
his
way
out
as
he
could
chapter
xxi
there
is
a
pretty
public
walk
at
poitiers
laid
out
upon
the
crest
of
the
high
hill
around
which
the
little
city
clusters
planted
with
thick
trees
and
looking
down
upon
the
fertile
fields
in
which
the
old
english
princes
fought
for
their
right
and
held
it
newman
paced
up
and
down
this
quiet
promenade
for
the
greater
part
of
the
next
day
and
let
his
eyes
wander
over
the
historic
prospect
but
he
would
have
been
sadly
at
a
loss
to
tell
you
afterwards
whether
the
latter
was
made
up
of
or
of
vineyards
he
was
wholly
given
up
to
his
grievance
of
which
reflection
by
no
means
diminished
the
weight
he
feared
that
madame
de
cintré
was
irretrievably
lost
and
yet
as
he
would
have
said
himself
he
didn
t
see
his
way
clear
to
giving
her
up
he
found
it
impossible
to
turn
his
back
upon
fleurières
and
its
inhabitants
it
seemed
to
him
that
some
germ
of
hope
or
reparation
must
lurk
there
somewhere
if
he
could
only
stretch
his
arm
out
far
enough
to
pluck
it
it
was
as
if
he
had
his
hand
on
a
and
were
closing
his
clenched
fist
upon
it
he
had
thumped
he
had
called
he
had
pressed
the
door
with
his
powerful
knee
and
shaken
it
with
all
his
strength
and
dead
damning
silence
had
answered
him
and
yet
something
held
him
there
something
hardened
the
grasp
of
his
fingers
newman
s
satisfaction
had
been
too
intense
his
whole
plan
too
deliberate
and
mature
his
prospect
of
happiness
too
rich
and
comprehensive
for
this
fine
moral
fabric
to
crumble
at
a
stroke
the
very
foundation
seemed
fatally
injured
and
yet
he
felt
a
stubborn
desire
still
to
try
to
save
the
edifice
he
was
filled
with
a
sorer
sense
of
wrong
than
he
had
ever
known
or
than
he
had
supposed
it
possible
he
should
know
to
accept
his
injury
and
walk
away
without
looking
behind
him
was
a
stretch
of
of
which
he
found
himself
incapable
he
looked
behind
him
intently
and
continually
and
what
he
saw
there
did
not
assuage
his
resentment
he
saw
himself
trustful
generous
liberal
patient
easy
pocketing
frequent
irritation
and
furnishing
unlimited
modesty
to
have
eaten
humble
pie
to
have
been
snubbed
and
patronized
and
satirized
and
have
consented
to
take
it
as
one
of
the
conditions
of
the
bargain
to
have
done
this
and
done
it
all
for
nothing
surely
gave
one
a
right
to
protest
and
to
be
turned
off
because
one
was
a
commercial
person
as
if
he
had
ever
talked
or
dreamt
of
the
commercial
since
his
connection
with
the
bellegardes
began
as
if
he
had
made
the
least
circumstance
of
the
commercial
as
if
he
would
not
have
consented
to
confound
the
commercial
fifty
times
a
day
if
it
might
have
increased
by
a
hair
s
breadth
the
chance
of
the
bellegardes
not
playing
him
a
trick
granted
that
being
commercial
was
fair
ground
for
having
a
trick
played
upon
one
how
little
they
knew
about
the
class
so
designed
and
its
enterprising
way
of
not
standing
upon
trifles
it
was
in
the
light
of
his
injury
that
the
weight
of
newman
s
past
endurance
seemed
so
heavy
his
actual
irritation
had
not
been
so
great
merged
as
it
was
in
his
vision
of
the
cloudless
blue
that
overarched
his
immediate
wooing
but
now
his
sense
of
outrage
was
deep
rancorous
and
ever
present
he
felt
that
he
was
a
good
fellow
wronged
as
for
madame
de
cintré
s
conduct
it
struck
him
with
a
kind
of
awe
and
the
fact
that
he
was
powerless
to
understand
it
or
feel
the
reality
of
its
motives
only
deepened
the
force
with
which
he
had
attached
himself
to
her
he
had
never
let
the
fact
of
her
catholicism
trouble
him
catholicism
to
him
was
nothing
but
a
name
and
to
express
a
mistrust
of
the
form
in
which
her
religious
feelings
had
moulded
themselves
would
have
seemed
to
him
on
his
own
part
a
rather
pretentious
affectation
of
protestant
zeal
if
such
superb
white
flowers
as
that
could
bloom
in
catholic
soil
the
soil
was
not
insalubrious
but
it
was
one
thing
to
be
a
catholic
and
another
to
turn
nun
on
your
hand
there
was
something
lugubriously
comical
in
the
way
newman
s
thoroughly
contemporaneous
optimism
was
confronted
with
this
dusky
expedient
to
see
a
woman
made
for
him
and
for
motherhood
to
his
children
juggled
away
in
this
tragic
travesty
it
was
a
thing
to
rub
one
s
eyes
over
a
nightmare
an
illusion
a
hoax
but
the
hours
passed
away
without
disproving
the
thing
and
leaving
him
only
the
of
the
vehemence
with
which
he
had
embraced
madame
de
cintré
he
remembered
her
words
and
her
looks
he
turned
them
over
and
tried
to
shake
the
mystery
out
of
them
and
to
infuse
them
with
an
endurable
meaning
what
had
she
meant
by
her
feeling
being
a
kind
of
religion
it
was
the
religion
simply
of
the
family
laws
the
religion
of
which
her
implacable
little
mother
was
the
high
priestess
twist
the
thing
about
as
her
generosity
would
the
one
certain
fact
was
that
they
had
used
force
against
her
her
generosity
had
tried
to
screen
them
but
newman
s
heart
rose
into
his
throat
at
the
thought
that
they
should
go
the
hours
wore
themselves
away
and
the
next
morning
newman
sprang
to
his
feet
with
the
resolution
to
return
to
fleurières
and
demand
another
interview
with
madame
de
bellegarde
and
her
son
he
lost
no
time
in
putting
it
into
practice
as
he
rolled
swiftly
over
the
excellent
road
in
the
little
calèche
furnished
him
at
the
inn
at
poitiers
he
drew
forth
as
it
were
from
the
very
safe
place
in
his
mind
to
which
he
had
consigned
it
the
last
information
given
him
by
poor
valentin
valentin
had
told
him
he
could
do
something
with
it
and
newman
thought
it
would
be
well
to
have
it
at
hand
this
was
of
course
not
the
first
time
lately
that
newman
had
given
it
his
attention
it
was
information
in
the
rough
it
was
dark
and
puzzling
but
newman
was
neither
helpless
nor
afraid
valentin
had
evidently
meant
to
put
him
in
possession
of
a
powerful
instrument
though
he
could
not
be
said
to
have
placed
the
handle
very
securely
within
his
grasp
but
if
he
had
not
really
told
him
the
secret
he
had
at
least
given
him
the
clew
to
it
a
clew
of
which
that
queer
old
mrs
bread
held
the
other
end
mrs
bread
had
always
looked
to
newman
as
if
she
knew
secrets
and
as
he
apparently
enjoyed
her
esteem
he
suspected
she
might
be
induced
to
share
her
knowledge
with
him
so
long
as
there
was
only
mrs
bread
to
deal
with
he
felt
easy
as
to
what
there
was
to
find
out
he
had
only
one
fear
that
it
might
not
be
bad
enough
then
when
the
image
of
the
marquise
and
her
son
rose
before
him
again
standing
side
by
side
the
old
woman
s
hand
in
urbain
s
arm
and
the
same
cold
unsociable
fixedness
in
the
eyes
of
each
he
cried
out
to
himself
that
the
fear
was
groundless
there
was
blood
in
the
secret
at
the
very
least
he
arrived
at
fleurières
almost
in
a
state
of
elation
he
had
satisfied
himself
logically
that
in
the
presence
of
his
threat
of
exposure
they
would
as
he
mentally
phrased
it
rattle
down
like
unwound
buckets
he
remembered
indeed
that
he
must
first
catch
his
hare
first
ascertain
what
there
was
to
expose
but
after
that
why
shouldn
t
his
happiness
be
as
good
as
new
again
mother
and
son
would
drop
their
lovely
victim
in
terror
and
take
to
hiding
and
madame
de
cintré
left
to
herself
would
surely
come
back
to
him
give
her
a
chance
and
she
would
rise
to
the
surface
return
to
the
light
how
could
she
fail
to
perceive
that
his
house
would
be
much
the
most
comfortable
sort
of
convent
newman
as
he
had
done
before
left
his
conveyance
at
the
inn
and
walked
the
short
remaining
distance
to
the
château
when
he
reached
the
gate
however
a
singular
feeling
took
possession
of
him
a
feeling
which
strange
as
it
may
seem
had
its
source
in
its
unfathomable
good
nature
he
stood
there
a
while
looking
through
the
bars
at
the
large
face
of
the
edifice
and
wondering
to
what
crime
it
was
that
the
dark
old
house
with
its
flowery
name
had
given
convenient
occasion
it
had
given
occasion
first
and
last
to
tyrannies
and
sufferings
enough
newman
said
to
himself
it
was
an
place
to
live
in
then
suddenly
came
the
reflection
what
a
horrible
of
iniquity
to
fumble
in
the
attitude
of
inquisitor
turned
its
ignobler
face
and
with
the
same
movement
newman
declared
that
the
bellegardes
should
have
another
chance
he
would
appeal
once
more
directly
to
their
sense
of
fairness
and
not
to
their
fear
and
if
they
should
be
accessible
to
reason
he
need
know
nothing
worse
about
them
than
what
he
already
knew
that
was
bad
enough
the
let
him
in
through
the
same
stiff
crevice
as
before
and
he
passed
through
the
court
and
over
the
little
rustic
bridge
on
the
moat
the
door
was
opened
before
he
had
reached
it
and
as
if
to
put
his
clemency
to
rout
with
the
suggestion
of
a
richer
opportunity
mrs
bread
stood
there
awaiting
him
her
face
as
usual
looked
as
hopelessly
blank
as
the
and
her
black
garments
seemed
of
an
intenser
sable
newman
had
already
learned
that
her
strange
inexpressiveness
could
be
a
vehicle
for
emotion
and
he
was
not
surprised
at
the
muffled
vivacity
with
which
she
whispered
i
thought
you
would
try
again
sir
i
was
looking
out
for
i
am
glad
to
see
you
said
newman
i
think
you
are
my
mrs
bread
looked
at
him
opaquely
i
wish
you
well
sir
but
it
s
vain
wishing
you
know
then
how
they
have
treated
me
oh
sir
said
mrs
bread
dryly
i
know
newman
hesitated
a
moment
everything
mrs
bread
gave
him
a
glance
somewhat
more
lucent
i
know
at
least
too
much
one
can
never
know
too
much
i
congratulate
you
i
have
come
to
see
madame
de
bellegarde
and
her
son
newman
added
are
they
at
home
if
they
are
not
i
will
my
lady
is
always
at
home
mrs
bread
replied
and
the
marquis
is
mostly
with
please
then
tell
them
one
or
the
other
or
both
that
i
am
here
and
that
i
desire
to
see
mrs
bread
hesitated
may
i
take
a
great
liberty
sir
you
have
never
taken
a
liberty
but
you
have
justified
it
said
newman
with
diplomatic
urbanity
mrs
bread
dropped
her
wrinkled
eyelids
as
if
she
were
curtseying
but
the
curtsey
stopped
there
the
occasion
was
too
grave
you
have
come
to
plead
with
them
again
sir
perhaps
you
don
t
know
this
that
madame
de
cintré
returned
this
morning
to
ah
she
s
gone
and
newman
groaning
smote
the
pavement
with
his
stick
she
has
gone
straight
to
the
convent
the
carmelites
they
call
it
i
see
you
know
sir
my
lady
and
the
marquis
take
it
very
ill
it
was
only
last
night
she
told
ah
she
had
kept
it
back
then
cried
newman
good
good
and
they
are
very
fierce
they
are
not
pleased
said
mrs
bread
but
they
may
well
dislike
it
they
tell
me
it
s
most
dreadful
sir
of
all
the
nuns
in
christendom
the
carmelites
are
the
worst
you
may
say
they
are
really
not
human
sir
they
make
you
give
up
everything
forever
and
to
think
of
there
if
i
was
one
that
cried
sir
i
could
newman
looked
at
her
an
instant
we
mustn
t
cry
mrs
bread
we
must
act
go
and
call
them
and
he
made
a
movement
to
enter
farther
but
mrs
bread
gently
checked
him
may
i
take
another
liberty
i
am
told
you
were
with
my
dearest
valentin
in
his
last
hours
if
you
would
tell
me
a
word
about
him
the
poor
count
was
my
own
boy
sir
for
the
first
year
of
his
life
he
was
hardly
out
of
my
arms
i
taught
him
to
speak
and
the
count
spoke
so
well
sir
he
always
spoke
well
to
his
poor
old
bread
when
he
grew
up
and
took
his
pleasure
he
always
had
a
kind
word
for
me
and
to
die
in
that
wild
way
they
have
a
story
that
he
fought
with
a
i
can
t
believe
that
sir
and
was
he
in
great
pain
you
are
a
wise
kind
old
woman
bread
said
newman
i
hoped
i
might
see
you
with
my
own
children
in
your
arms
perhaps
i
shall
and
he
put
out
his
hand
mrs
bread
looked
for
a
moment
at
his
open
palm
and
then
as
if
fascinated
by
the
novelty
of
the
gesture
extended
her
own
ladylike
fingers
newman
held
her
hand
firmly
and
deliberately
fixing
his
eyes
upon
her
you
want
to
know
all
about
valentin
he
said
it
would
be
a
sad
pleasure
i
can
tell
you
everything
can
you
sometimes
leave
this
place
the
château
sir
i
really
don
t
know
i
never
try
then
try
hard
try
this
evening
at
dusk
come
to
me
in
the
old
ruin
there
on
the
hill
in
the
court
before
the
church
i
will
wait
for
you
there
i
have
something
very
important
to
tell
you
an
old
woman
like
you
can
do
as
she
mrs
bread
stared
wondering
with
parted
lips
is
it
from
the
count
sir
she
asked
from
the
count
from
his
said
newman
i
will
come
then
i
will
be
bold
for
once
for
she
led
newman
into
the
great
with
which
he
had
already
made
acquaintance
and
retired
to
execute
his
commands
newman
waited
a
long
time
at
last
he
was
on
the
point
of
ringing
and
repeating
his
request
he
was
looking
round
him
for
a
bell
when
the
marquis
came
in
with
his
mother
on
his
arm
it
will
be
seen
that
newman
had
a
logical
mind
when
i
say
that
he
declared
to
himself
in
perfect
good
faith
as
a
result
of
valentin
s
dark
hints
that
his
adversaries
looked
grossly
wicked
there
is
no
mistake
about
it
now
he
said
to
himself
as
they
advanced
they
re
a
bad
lot
they
have
pulled
off
the
madame
de
bellegarde
and
her
son
certainly
bore
in
their
faces
the
signs
of
extreme
perturbation
they
looked
like
people
who
had
passed
a
sleepless
night
confronted
moreover
with
an
annoyance
which
they
hoped
they
had
disposed
of
it
was
not
natural
that
they
should
have
any
very
tender
glances
to
bestow
upon
newman
he
stood
before
them
and
such
as
they
found
available
they
leveled
at
him
newman
feeling
as
if
the
door
of
a
sepulchre
had
suddenly
been
opened
and
the
damp
darkness
were
being
exhaled
you
see
i
have
come
back
he
said
i
have
come
to
try
it
would
be
ridiculous
said
de
bellegarde
to
pretend
that
we
are
glad
to
see
you
or
that
we
don
t
question
the
taste
of
your
oh
don
t
talk
about
taste
said
newman
with
a
laugh
or
that
will
bring
us
round
to
yours
if
i
consulted
my
taste
i
certainly
shouldn
t
come
to
see
you
besides
i
will
make
as
short
work
as
you
please
promise
me
to
raise
the
blockade
to
set
madame
de
cintré
at
liberty
and
i
will
retire
we
hesitated
as
to
whether
we
would
see
you
said
madame
de
bellegarde
and
we
were
on
the
point
of
declining
the
honor
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
we
should
act
with
civility
as
we
have
always
done
and
i
wished
to
have
the
satisfaction
of
informing
you
that
there
are
certain
weaknesses
that
people
of
our
way
of
feeling
can
be
guilty
of
but
you
may
be
weak
but
once
but
you
will
be
audacious
many
times
madam
newman
answered
i
didn
t
come
however
for
conversational
purposes
i
came
to
say
this
simply
that
if
you
will
write
immediately
to
your
daughter
that
you
withdraw
your
opposition
to
her
marriage
i
will
take
care
of
the
rest
you
don
t
want
her
to
turn
nun
you
know
more
about
the
horrors
of
it
than
i
do
marrying
a
commercial
person
is
better
than
that
give
me
a
letter
to
her
signed
and
sealed
saying
you
retract
and
that
she
may
marry
me
with
your
blessing
and
i
will
take
it
to
her
at
the
convent
and
bring
her
out
there
s
your
chance
i
call
those
easy
we
look
at
the
matter
otherwise
you
know
we
call
them
very
hard
terms
said
urbain
de
bellegarde
they
had
all
remained
standing
rigidly
in
the
middle
of
the
room
i
think
my
mother
will
tell
you
that
she
would
rather
her
daughter
should
become
sœur
catherine
than
but
the
old
lady
with
the
serenity
of
supreme
power
let
her
son
make
her
epigrams
for
her
she
only
smiled
almost
sweetly
shaking
her
head
and
repeating
but
once
newman
but
once
nothing
that
newman
had
ever
seen
or
heard
gave
him
such
a
sense
of
marble
hardness
as
this
movement
and
the
tone
that
accompanied
it
could
anything
compel
you
he
asked
do
you
know
of
anything
that
would
force
you
this
language
sir
said
the
marquis
addressed
to
people
in
bereavement
and
grief
is
beyond
all
in
most
cases
newman
answered
your
objection
would
have
some
weight
even
admitting
that
madame
de
cintré
s
present
intentions
make
time
precious
but
i
have
thought
of
what
you
speak
of
and
i
have
come
here
without
scruple
simply
because
i
consider
your
brother
and
you
two
very
different
parties
i
see
no
connection
between
you
your
brother
was
ashamed
of
you
lying
there
wounded
and
dying
the
poor
fellow
apologized
to
me
for
your
conduct
he
apologized
to
me
for
that
of
his
for
a
moment
the
effect
of
these
words
was
as
if
newman
had
struck
a
physical
blow
a
quick
flush
leaped
into
the
faces
of
madame
de
bellegarde
and
her
son
and
they
exchanged
a
glance
like
a
twinkle
of
steel
urbain
uttered
two
words
which
newman
but
half
heard
but
of
which
the
sense
came
to
him
as
it
were
in
the
reverberation
of
the
sound
misérable
you
show
little
respect
for
the
living
said
madame
de
bellegarde
but
at
least
respect
the
dead
don
t
profane
don
t
insult
the
memory
of
my
innocent
i
speak
the
simple
truth
newman
declared
and
i
speak
it
for
a
purpose
i
repeat
it
distinctly
your
son
was
utterly
disgusted
your
son
urbain
de
bellegarde
was
frowning
portentously
and
newman
supposed
he
was
frowning
at
poor
valentin
s
invidious
image
taken
by
surprise
his
scant
affection
for
his
brother
had
made
a
momentary
concession
to
dishonor
but
not
for
an
appreciable
instant
did
his
mother
lower
her
flag
you
are
immensely
mistaken
sir
she
said
my
son
was
sometimes
light
but
he
was
never
indecent
he
died
faithful
to
his
you
simply
misunderstood
him
said
the
marquis
beginning
to
rally
you
affirm
the
impossible
oh
i
don
t
care
for
poor
valentin
s
apology
said
newman
it
was
far
more
painful
than
pleasant
to
me
this
atrocious
thing
was
not
his
fault
he
never
hurt
me
or
anyone
else
he
was
the
soul
of
honor
but
it
shows
how
he
took
if
you
wish
to
prove
that
my
poor
brother
in
his
last
moments
was
out
of
his
head
we
can
only
say
that
under
the
melancholy
circumstances
nothing
was
more
possible
but
confine
yourself
to
he
was
quite
in
his
right
mind
said
newman
with
gentle
but
dangerous
doggedness
i
have
never
seen
him
so
bright
and
clever
it
was
terrible
to
see
that
witty
capable
fellow
dying
such
a
death
you
know
i
was
very
fond
of
your
brother
and
i
have
further
proof
of
his
sanity
newman
concluded
the
marquise
gathered
herself
together
majestically
this
is
too
gross
she
cried
we
decline
to
accept
your
story
sir
we
repudiate
it
urbain
open
the
she
turned
away
with
an
imperious
motion
to
her
son
and
passed
rapidly
down
the
length
of
the
room
the
marquis
went
with
her
and
held
the
door
open
newman
was
left
standing
he
lifted
his
finger
as
a
sign
to
de
bellegarde
who
closed
the
door
behind
his
mother
and
stood
waiting
newman
slowly
advanced
more
silent
for
the
moment
than
life
the
two
men
stood
face
to
face
then
newman
had
a
singular
sensation
he
felt
his
sense
of
injury
almost
brimming
over
into
jocularity
come
he
said
you
don
t
treat
me
well
at
least
admit
de
bellegarde
looked
at
him
from
head
to
foot
and
then
in
the
most
delicate
voice
i
detest
you
personally
he
said
that
s
the
way
i
feel
to
you
but
for
politeness
sake
i
don
t
say
it
said
newman
it
s
singular
i
should
want
so
much
to
be
your
but
i
can
t
give
it
up
let
me
try
once
and
he
paused
a
moment
you
have
a
secret
you
have
a
skeleton
in
the
de
bellegarde
continued
to
look
at
him
hard
but
newman
could
not
see
whether
his
eyes
betrayed
anything
the
look
of
his
eyes
was
always
so
strange
newman
paused
again
and
then
went
on
you
and
your
mother
have
committed
a
at
this
de
bellegarde
s
eyes
certainly
did
change
they
seemed
to
flicker
like
blown
candles
newman
could
see
that
he
was
profoundly
startled
but
there
was
something
admirable
in
his
continue
said
de
bellegarde
newman
lifted
a
finger
and
made
it
waver
a
little
in
the
air
need
i
continue
you
are
pray
where
did
you
obtain
this
interesting
information
de
bellegarde
asked
very
softly
i
shall
be
strictly
accurate
said
newman
i
won
t
pretend
to
know
more
than
i
do
at
present
that
is
all
i
know
you
have
done
something
that
you
must
hide
something
that
would
damn
you
if
it
were
known
something
that
would
disgrace
the
name
you
are
so
proud
of
i
don
t
know
what
it
is
but
i
can
find
out
persist
in
your
present
course
and
i
find
out
change
it
let
your
sister
go
in
peace
and
i
will
leave
you
alone
it
s
a
bargain
the
marquis
almost
succeeded
in
looking
untroubled
the
breaking
up
of
the
ice
in
his
handsome
countenance
was
an
operation
that
was
necessarily
gradual
but
newman
s
argumentation
seemed
to
press
and
press
and
presently
he
averted
his
eyes
he
stood
some
moments
reflecting
my
brother
told
you
this
he
said
looking
up
newman
hesitated
a
moment
yes
your
brother
told
the
marquis
smiled
handsomely
didn
t
i
say
that
he
was
out
of
his
mind
he
was
out
of
his
mind
if
i
don
t
find
out
he
was
very
much
in
it
if
i
de
bellegarde
gave
a
shrug
eh
sir
find
out
or
not
as
you
i
don
t
frighten
you
demanded
newman
that
s
for
you
to
no
it
s
for
you
to
judge
at
your
leisure
think
it
over
feel
yourself
all
round
i
will
give
you
an
hour
or
two
i
can
t
give
you
more
for
how
do
we
know
how
fast
they
may
be
making
madame
de
cintré
a
nun
talk
it
over
with
your
mother
let
her
judge
whether
she
is
frightened
i
don
t
believe
she
is
as
easily
frightened
in
general
as
you
but
you
will
see
i
will
go
and
wait
in
the
village
at
the
inn
and
i
beg
you
to
let
me
know
as
soon
as
possible
say
by
three
o
clock
a
simple
or
on
paper
will
do
only
you
know
in
case
of
a
i
shall
expect
you
this
time
to
stick
to
your
and
with
this
newman
opened
the
door
and
let
himself
out
the
marquis
did
not
move
and
newman
retiring
gave
him
another
look
at
the
inn
in
the
village
he
repeated
then
he
turned
away
altogether
and
passed
out
of
the
house
he
was
extremely
excited
by
what
he
had
been
doing
for
it
was
inevitable
that
there
should
be
a
certain
emotion
in
calling
up
the
spectre
of
dishonor
before
a
family
a
thousand
years
old
but
he
went
back
to
the
inn
and
contrived
to
wait
there
deliberately
for
the
next
two
hours
he
thought
it
more
than
probable
that
urbain
de
bellegarde
would
give
no
sign
for
an
answer
to
his
challenge
in
either
sense
would
be
a
confession
of
guilt
what
he
most
expected
was
silence
in
other
words
defiance
but
he
prayed
that
as
he
imagined
it
his
shot
might
bring
them
down
it
did
bring
by
three
o
clock
a
note
delivered
by
a
footman
a
note
addressed
in
urbain
de
bellegarde
s
handsome
english
hand
it
ran
as
follows
i
can
not
deny
myself
the
satisfaction
of
letting
you
know
that
i
return
to
paris
with
my
mother
in
order
that
we
may
see
my
sister
and
confirm
her
in
the
resolution
which
is
the
most
effectual
reply
to
your
audacious
pertinacity
de
newman
put
the
letter
into
his
pocket
and
continued
his
walk
up
and
down
the
he
had
spent
most
of
his
time
for
the
past
week
in
walking
up
and
down
he
continued
to
measure
the
length
of
the
little
of
the
armes
de
france
until
the
day
began
to
wane
when
he
went
out
to
keep
his
rendezvous
with
mrs
bread
the
path
which
led
up
the
hill
to
the
ruin
was
easy
to
find
and
newman
in
a
short
time
had
followed
it
to
the
top
he
passed
beneath
the
rugged
arch
of
the
castle
wall
and
looked
about
him
in
the
early
dusk
for
an
old
woman
in
black
the
castle
yard
was
empty
but
the
door
of
the
church
was
open
newman
went
into
the
little
nave
and
of
course
found
a
deeper
dusk
than
without
a
couple
of
tapers
however
twinkled
on
the
altar
and
just
enabled
him
to
perceive
a
figure
seated
by
one
of
the
pillars
closer
inspection
helped
him
to
recognize
mrs
bread
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
she
was
dressed
with
unwonted
splendor
she
wore
a
large
black
silk
bonnet
with
imposing
bows
of
crape
and
an
old
black
satin
dress
disposed
itself
in
vaguely
lustrous
folds
about
her
person
she
had
judged
it
proper
to
the
occasion
to
appear
in
her
stateliest
apparel
she
had
been
sitting
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
ground
but
when
newman
passed
before
her
she
looked
up
at
him
and
then
she
rose
are
you
a
catholic
mrs
bread
he
asked
no
sir
i
m
a
good
woman
very
low
she
answered
but
i
thought
i
should
be
safer
in
here
than
outside
i
was
never
out
in
the
evening
before
we
shall
be
safer
said
newman
where
no
one
can
hear
and
he
led
the
way
back
into
the
castle
court
and
then
followed
a
path
beside
the
church
which
he
was
sure
must
lead
into
another
part
of
the
ruin
he
was
not
deceived
it
wandered
along
the
crest
of
the
hill
and
terminated
before
a
fragment
of
wall
pierced
by
a
rough
aperture
which
had
once
been
a
door
through
this
aperture
newman
passed
and
found
himself
in
a
nook
peculiarly
favorable
to
quiet
conversation
as
probably
many
an
earnest
couple
otherwise
assorted
than
our
friends
had
assured
themselves
the
hill
sloped
abruptly
away
and
on
the
remnant
of
its
crest
were
scattered
two
or
three
fragments
of
stone
beneath
over
the
plain
lay
the
gathered
twilight
through
which
in
the
near
distance
gleamed
two
or
three
lights
from
the
château
mrs
bread
rustled
slowly
after
her
guide
and
newman
satisfying
himself
that
one
of
the
fallen
stones
was
steady
proposed
to
her
to
sit
upon
it
she
cautiously
complied
and
he
placed
himself
upon
another
near
her
chapter
xxii
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
coming
newman
said
i
hope
it
won
t
get
you
into
i
don
t
think
i
shall
be
missed
my
lady
in
these
days
is
not
fond
of
having
me
about
this
was
said
with
a
certain
fluttered
eagerness
which
increased
newman
s
sense
of
having
inspired
the
old
woman
with
confidence
from
the
first
you
know
he
answered
you
took
an
interest
in
my
prospects
you
were
on
my
side
that
gratified
me
i
assure
you
and
now
that
you
know
what
they
have
done
to
me
i
am
sure
you
are
with
me
all
the
they
have
not
done
well
i
must
say
it
said
mrs
bread
but
you
mustn
t
blame
the
poor
countess
they
pressed
her
i
would
give
a
million
of
dollars
to
know
what
they
did
to
her
cried
newman
mrs
bread
sat
with
a
dull
oblique
gaze
fixed
upon
the
lights
of
the
château
they
worked
on
her
feelings
they
knew
that
was
the
way
she
is
a
delicate
creature
they
made
her
feel
wicked
she
is
only
too
ah
they
made
her
feel
wicked
said
newman
slowly
and
then
he
repeated
it
they
made
her
feel
wicked
they
made
her
feel
the
words
seemed
to
him
for
the
moment
a
vivid
description
of
infernal
ingenuity
it
was
because
she
was
so
good
that
she
gave
up
poor
sweet
lady
added
mrs
bread
but
she
was
better
to
them
than
to
me
said
newman
she
was
afraid
said
mrs
bread
very
confidently
she
has
always
been
afraid
or
at
least
for
a
long
time
that
was
the
real
trouble
sir
she
was
like
a
fair
peach
i
may
say
with
just
one
little
speck
she
had
one
little
sad
spot
you
pushed
her
into
the
sunshine
sir
and
it
almost
disappeared
then
they
pulled
her
back
into
the
shade
and
in
a
moment
it
began
to
spread
before
we
knew
it
she
was
gone
she
was
a
delicate
this
singular
attestation
of
madame
de
cintré
s
delicacy
for
all
its
singularity
set
newman
s
wound
aching
afresh
i
see
he
presently
said
she
knew
something
bad
about
her
no
sir
she
knew
nothing
said
mrs
bread
holding
her
head
very
stiff
and
keeping
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
glimmering
windows
of
the
château
she
guessed
something
then
or
suspected
she
was
afraid
to
know
said
mrs
bread
but
know
at
any
rate
said
newman
she
slowly
turned
her
vague
eyes
upon
newman
squeezing
her
hands
together
in
her
lap
you
are
not
quite
faithful
sir
i
thought
it
was
to
tell
me
about
valentin
you
asked
me
to
come
oh
the
more
we
talk
of
valentin
the
better
said
newman
that
s
exactly
what
i
want
i
was
with
him
as
i
told
you
in
his
last
hour
he
was
in
a
great
deal
of
pain
but
he
was
quite
himself
you
know
what
that
means
he
was
bright
and
lively
and
oh
he
would
always
be
clever
sir
said
mrs
bread
and
did
he
know
of
your
trouble
yes
he
guessed
it
of
and
what
did
he
say
to
it
he
said
it
was
a
disgrace
to
his
name
but
it
was
not
the
lord
lord
murmured
mrs
bread
he
said
that
his
mother
and
his
brother
had
once
put
their
heads
together
and
invented
something
even
you
shouldn
t
have
listened
to
that
perhaps
not
but
i
listen
and
i
don
t
forget
it
now
i
want
to
know
what
it
is
they
mrs
bread
gave
a
soft
moan
and
you
have
enticed
me
up
into
this
strange
place
to
tell
you
don
t
be
alarmed
said
newman
i
won
t
say
a
word
that
shall
be
disagreeable
to
you
tell
me
as
it
suits
you
and
when
it
suits
you
only
remember
that
it
was
valentin
s
last
wish
that
you
did
he
say
that
he
said
it
with
his
last
breath
tell
mrs
bread
i
told
you
to
ask
why
didn
t
he
tell
you
himself
it
was
too
long
a
story
for
a
dying
man
he
had
no
breath
left
in
his
body
he
could
only
say
that
he
wanted
me
to
know
that
wronged
as
i
was
it
was
my
right
to
but
how
will
it
help
you
sir
said
mrs
bread
that
s
for
me
to
decide
valentin
believed
it
would
and
that
s
why
he
told
me
your
name
was
almost
the
last
word
he
mrs
bread
was
evidently
by
this
statement
she
shook
her
clasped
hands
slowly
up
and
down
excuse
me
sir
she
said
if
i
take
a
great
liberty
is
it
the
solemn
truth
you
are
speaking
i
ask
you
that
must
i
not
sir
there
s
no
offense
it
the
solemn
truth
i
solemnly
swear
it
valentin
himself
would
certainly
have
told
me
more
if
he
had
been
oh
sir
if
he
knew
more
don
t
you
suppose
he
did
there
s
no
saying
what
he
knew
about
anything
said
mrs
bread
with
a
mild
he
was
so
mightily
clever
he
could
make
you
believe
he
knew
things
that
he
didn
t
and
that
he
didn
t
know
others
that
he
had
better
not
have
i
suspect
he
knew
something
about
his
brother
that
kept
the
marquis
civil
to
him
newman
propounded
he
made
the
marquis
feel
him
what
he
wanted
now
was
to
put
me
in
his
place
he
wanted
to
give
me
a
chance
to
make
the
marquis
feel
mercy
on
us
cried
the
old
how
wicked
we
all
are
i
don
t
know
said
newman
some
of
us
are
wicked
certainly
i
am
very
angry
i
am
very
sore
and
i
am
very
bitter
but
i
don
t
know
that
i
am
wicked
i
have
been
cruelly
injured
they
have
hurt
me
and
i
want
to
hurt
them
i
don
t
deny
that
on
the
contrary
i
tell
you
plainly
that
it
is
the
use
i
want
to
make
of
your
mrs
bread
seemed
to
hold
her
breath
you
want
to
publish
them
you
want
to
shame
them
i
want
to
bring
them
down
down
down
down
i
want
to
turn
the
tables
upon
them
i
want
to
mortify
them
as
they
mortified
me
they
took
me
up
into
a
high
place
and
made
me
stand
there
for
all
the
world
to
see
me
and
then
they
stole
behind
me
and
pushed
me
into
this
bottomless
pit
where
i
lie
howling
and
gnashing
my
teeth
i
made
a
fool
of
myself
before
all
their
friends
but
i
shall
make
something
worse
of
this
passionate
sally
which
newman
uttered
with
the
greater
fervor
that
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
had
a
chance
to
say
all
this
aloud
kindled
two
small
sparks
in
bread
s
fixed
eyes
i
suppose
you
have
a
right
to
your
anger
sir
but
think
of
the
dishonor
you
will
draw
down
on
madame
de
madame
de
cintré
is
buried
alive
cried
newman
what
are
honor
or
dishonor
to
her
the
door
of
the
tomb
is
at
this
moment
closing
behind
yes
it
s
most
awful
moaned
mrs
bread
she
has
moved
off
like
her
brother
valentin
to
give
me
room
to
work
it
s
as
if
it
were
done
on
surely
said
mrs
bread
apparently
impressed
by
the
ingenuity
of
this
reflection
she
was
silent
for
some
moments
then
she
added
and
would
you
bring
my
lady
before
the
courts
the
courts
care
nothing
for
my
lady
newman
replied
if
she
has
committed
a
crime
she
will
be
nothing
for
the
courts
but
a
wicked
old
and
will
they
hang
her
sir
that
depends
upon
what
she
has
and
newman
eyed
mrs
bread
intently
it
would
break
up
the
family
most
terribly
sir
it
s
time
such
a
family
should
be
broken
up
said
newman
with
a
laugh
and
me
at
my
age
out
of
place
sir
sighed
mrs
bread
oh
i
will
take
care
of
you
you
shall
come
and
live
with
me
you
shall
be
my
housekeeper
or
anything
you
like
i
will
pension
you
for
dear
dear
sir
you
think
of
and
she
seemed
to
fall
newman
watched
her
a
while
and
then
he
said
suddenly
ah
mrs
bread
you
are
too
fond
of
my
lady
she
looked
at
him
as
quickly
i
wouldn
t
have
you
say
that
sir
i
don
t
think
it
any
part
of
my
duty
to
be
fond
of
my
lady
i
have
served
her
faithfully
this
many
a
year
but
if
she
were
to
die
i
believe
before
heaven
i
shouldn
t
shed
a
tear
for
then
after
a
pause
i
have
no
reason
to
love
her
mrs
bread
added
the
most
she
has
done
for
me
has
been
not
to
turn
me
out
of
the
newman
felt
that
decidedly
his
companion
was
more
and
more
confidential
that
if
luxury
is
corrupting
bread
s
conservative
habits
were
already
relaxed
by
the
spiritual
comfort
of
this
preconcerted
interview
in
a
remarkable
locality
with
a
millionaire
all
his
native
shrewdness
admonished
him
that
his
part
was
simply
to
let
her
take
her
time
let
the
charm
of
the
occasion
work
so
he
said
nothing
he
only
looked
at
her
kindly
mrs
bread
sat
nursing
her
lean
elbows
my
lady
once
did
me
a
great
wrong
she
went
on
at
last
she
has
a
terrible
tongue
when
she
is
vexed
it
was
many
a
year
ago
but
i
have
never
forgotten
it
i
have
never
mentioned
it
to
a
human
creature
i
have
kept
my
grudge
to
myself
i
dare
say
i
have
been
wicked
but
my
grudge
has
grown
old
with
me
it
has
grown
good
for
nothing
too
i
dare
say
but
it
has
lived
along
as
i
have
lived
it
will
die
when
i
die
not
before
and
what
your
grudge
newman
asked
mrs
bread
dropped
her
eyes
and
hesitated
if
i
were
a
foreigner
sir
i
should
make
less
of
telling
you
it
comes
harder
to
a
decent
englishwoman
but
i
sometimes
think
i
have
picked
up
too
many
foreign
ways
what
i
was
telling
you
belongs
to
a
time
when
i
was
much
younger
and
very
different
looking
to
what
i
am
now
i
had
a
very
high
color
sir
if
you
can
believe
it
indeed
i
was
a
very
smart
lass
my
lady
was
younger
too
and
the
late
marquis
was
youngest
of
all
i
mean
in
the
way
he
went
on
sir
he
had
a
very
high
spirit
he
was
a
magnificent
man
he
was
fond
of
his
pleasure
like
most
foreigners
and
it
must
be
owned
that
he
sometimes
went
rather
below
him
to
take
it
my
lady
was
often
jealous
and
if
you
ll
believe
it
sir
she
did
me
the
honor
to
be
jealous
of
me
one
day
i
had
a
red
ribbon
in
my
cap
and
my
lady
flew
out
at
me
and
ordered
me
to
take
it
off
she
accused
me
of
putting
it
on
to
make
the
marquis
look
at
me
i
don
t
know
that
i
was
impertinent
but
i
spoke
up
like
an
honest
girl
and
didn
t
count
my
words
a
red
ribbon
indeed
as
if
it
was
my
ribbons
the
marquis
looked
at
my
lady
knew
afterwards
that
i
was
perfectly
respectable
but
she
never
said
a
word
to
show
that
she
believed
it
but
the
marquis
did
mrs
bread
presently
added
i
took
off
my
red
ribbon
and
put
it
away
in
a
drawer
where
i
have
kept
it
to
this
day
it
s
faded
now
it
s
a
very
pale
pink
but
there
it
lies
my
grudge
has
faded
too
the
red
has
all
gone
out
of
it
but
it
lies
here
and
mrs
bread
stroked
her
black
satin
bodice
newman
listened
with
interest
to
this
decent
narrative
which
seemed
to
have
opened
up
the
deeps
of
memory
to
his
companion
then
as
she
remained
silent
and
seemed
to
be
losing
herself
in
retrospective
meditation
upon
her
perfect
respectability
he
ventured
upon
a
short
cut
to
his
goal
so
madame
de
bellegarde
was
jealous
i
see
and
de
bellegarde
admired
pretty
women
without
distinction
of
class
i
suppose
one
mustn
t
be
hard
upon
him
for
they
probably
didn
t
all
behave
so
properly
as
you
but
years
afterwards
it
could
hardly
have
been
jealousy
that
turned
madame
de
bellegarde
into
a
mrs
bread
gave
a
weary
sigh
we
are
using
dreadful
words
sir
but
i
don
t
care
now
i
see
you
have
your
idea
and
i
have
no
will
of
my
own
my
will
was
the
will
of
my
children
as
i
called
them
but
i
have
lost
my
children
now
they
are
dead
i
may
say
it
of
both
of
them
and
what
should
i
care
for
the
living
what
is
anyone
in
the
house
to
me
now
what
am
i
to
them
my
lady
objects
to
me
she
has
objected
to
me
these
thirty
years
i
should
have
been
glad
to
be
something
to
young
madame
de
bellegarde
though
i
never
was
nurse
to
the
present
marquis
when
he
was
a
baby
i
was
too
young
they
wouldn
t
trust
me
with
him
but
his
wife
told
her
own
maid
mamselle
clarisse
the
opinion
she
had
of
me
perhaps
you
would
like
to
hear
it
oh
immensely
said
newman
she
said
that
if
i
would
sit
in
her
children
s
schoolroom
i
should
do
very
well
for
a
penwiper
when
things
have
come
to
that
i
don
t
think
i
need
stand
upon
decidedly
not
said
newman
go
on
mrs
bread
however
relapsed
again
into
troubled
dumbness
and
all
newman
could
do
was
to
fold
his
arms
and
wait
but
at
last
she
appeared
to
have
set
her
memories
in
order
it
was
when
the
late
marquis
was
an
old
man
and
his
eldest
son
had
been
two
years
married
it
was
when
the
time
came
on
for
marrying
mademoiselle
claire
that
s
the
way
they
talk
of
it
here
you
know
sir
the
marquis
s
health
was
bad
he
was
very
much
broken
down
my
lady
had
picked
out
de
cintré
for
no
good
reason
that
i
could
see
but
there
are
reasons
i
very
well
know
that
are
beyond
me
and
you
must
be
high
in
the
world
to
understand
them
old
de
cintré
was
very
high
and
my
lady
thought
him
almost
as
good
as
herself
that
s
saying
a
good
deal
urbain
took
sides
with
his
mother
as
he
always
did
the
trouble
i
believe
was
that
my
lady
would
give
very
little
money
and
all
the
other
gentlemen
asked
more
it
was
only
de
cintré
that
was
satisfied
the
lord
willed
it
he
should
have
that
one
soft
spot
it
was
the
only
one
he
had
he
may
have
been
very
grand
in
his
birth
and
he
certainly
was
very
grand
in
his
bows
and
speeches
but
that
was
all
the
grandeur
he
had
i
think
he
was
like
what
i
have
heard
of
comedians
not
that
i
have
ever
seen
one
but
i
know
he
painted
his
face
he
might
paint
it
all
he
would
he
could
never
make
me
like
it
the
marquis
couldn
t
abide
him
and
declared
that
sooner
than
take
such
a
husband
as
that
mademoiselle
claire
should
take
none
at
all
he
and
my
lady
had
a
great
scene
it
came
even
to
our
ears
in
the
servants
hall
it
was
not
their
first
quarrel
if
the
truth
must
be
told
they
were
not
a
loving
couple
but
they
didn
t
often
come
to
words
because
i
think
neither
of
them
thought
the
other
s
doings
worth
the
trouble
my
lady
had
long
ago
got
over
her
jealousy
and
she
had
taken
to
indifference
in
this
i
must
say
they
were
well
matched
the
marquis
was
very
he
had
a
most
gentlemanly
temper
he
got
angry
only
once
a
year
but
then
it
was
very
bad
he
always
took
to
bed
directly
afterwards
this
time
i
speak
of
he
took
to
bed
as
usual
but
he
never
got
up
again
i
m
afraid
the
poor
gentleman
was
paying
for
his
dissipation
isn
t
it
true
they
mostly
do
sir
when
they
get
old
my
lady
and
urbain
kept
quiet
but
i
know
my
lady
wrote
letters
to
de
cintré
the
marquis
got
worse
and
the
doctors
gave
him
up
my
lady
she
gave
him
up
too
and
if
the
truth
must
be
told
she
gave
him
up
gladly
when
once
he
was
out
of
the
way
she
could
do
what
she
pleased
with
her
daughter
and
it
was
all
arranged
that
my
poor
innocent
child
should
be
handed
over
to
de
cintré
you
don
t
know
what
mademoiselle
was
in
those
days
sir
she
was
the
sweetest
young
creature
in
france
and
knew
as
little
of
what
was
going
on
around
her
as
the
lamb
does
of
the
butcher
i
used
to
nurse
the
marquis
and
i
was
always
in
his
room
it
was
here
at
fleurières
in
the
autumn
we
had
a
doctor
from
paris
who
came
and
stayed
two
or
three
weeks
in
the
house
then
there
came
two
others
and
there
was
a
consultation
and
these
two
others
as
i
said
declared
that
the
marquis
couldn
t
be
saved
after
this
they
went
off
pocketing
their
fees
but
the
other
one
stayed
and
did
what
he
could
the
marquis
himself
kept
crying
out
that
he
wouldn
t
die
that
he
didn
t
want
to
die
that
he
would
live
and
look
after
his
daughter
mademoiselle
claire
and
the
viscount
that
was
valentin
you
know
were
both
in
the
house
the
doctor
was
a
clever
man
that
i
could
see
myself
and
i
think
he
believed
that
the
marquis
might
get
well
we
took
good
care
of
him
he
and
i
between
us
and
one
day
when
my
lady
had
almost
ordered
her
mourning
my
patient
suddenly
began
to
mend
he
got
better
and
better
till
the
doctor
said
he
was
out
of
danger
what
was
killing
him
was
the
dreadful
fits
of
pain
in
his
stomach
but
little
by
little
they
stopped
and
the
poor
marquis
began
to
make
his
jokes
again
the
doctor
found
something
that
gave
him
great
comfort
some
white
stuff
that
we
kept
in
a
great
bottle
on
the
i
used
to
give
it
to
the
marquis
through
a
glass
tube
it
always
made
him
easier
then
the
doctor
went
away
after
telling
me
to
keep
on
giving
him
the
mixture
whenever
he
was
bad
after
that
there
was
a
little
doctor
from
poitiers
who
came
every
day
so
we
were
alone
in
the
house
my
lady
and
her
poor
husband
and
their
three
children
young
madame
de
bellegarde
had
gone
away
with
her
little
girl
to
her
mothers
you
know
she
is
very
lively
and
her
maid
told
me
that
she
didn
t
like
to
be
where
people
were
mrs
bread
paused
a
moment
and
then
she
went
on
with
the
same
quiet
consistency
i
think
you
have
guessed
sir
that
when
the
marquis
began
to
turn
my
lady
was
and
she
paused
again
bending
upon
newman
a
face
which
seemed
to
grow
whiter
as
the
darkness
settled
down
upon
them
newman
had
listened
eagerly
with
an
eagerness
greater
even
than
that
with
which
he
had
bent
his
ear
to
valentin
de
bellegarde
s
last
words
every
now
and
then
as
his
companion
looked
up
at
him
she
reminded
him
of
an
ancient
tabby
cat
protracting
the
enjoyment
of
a
dish
of
milk
even
her
triumph
was
measured
and
decorous
the
faculty
of
exultation
had
been
chilled
by
disuse
she
presently
continued
late
one
night
i
was
sitting
by
the
marquis
in
his
room
the
great
red
room
in
the
west
tower
he
had
been
complaining
a
little
and
i
gave
him
a
spoonful
of
the
doctor
s
dose
my
lady
had
been
there
in
the
early
part
of
the
evening
she
sat
far
more
than
an
hour
by
his
bed
then
she
went
away
and
left
me
alone
after
midnight
she
came
back
and
her
eldest
son
was
with
her
they
went
to
the
bed
and
looked
at
the
marquis
and
my
lady
took
hold
of
his
hand
then
she
turned
to
me
and
said
he
was
not
so
well
i
remember
how
the
marquis
without
saying
anything
lay
staring
at
her
i
can
see
his
white
face
at
this
moment
in
the
great
black
square
between
the
i
said
i
didn
t
think
he
was
very
bad
and
she
told
me
to
go
to
bed
she
would
sit
a
while
with
him
when
the
marquis
saw
me
going
he
gave
a
sort
of
groan
and
called
out
to
me
not
to
leave
him
but
urbain
opened
the
door
for
me
and
pointed
the
way
out
the
present
marquis
perhaps
you
have
noticed
sir
has
a
very
proud
way
of
giving
orders
and
i
was
there
to
take
orders
i
went
to
my
room
but
i
wasn
t
easy
i
couldn
t
tell
you
why
i
didn
t
undress
i
sat
there
waiting
and
listening
for
what
would
you
have
said
sir
i
couldn
t
have
told
you
for
surely
a
poor
gentleman
might
be
comfortable
with
his
wife
and
his
son
it
was
as
if
i
expected
to
hear
the
marquis
moaning
after
me
again
i
listened
but
i
heard
nothing
it
was
a
very
still
night
i
never
knew
a
night
so
still
at
last
the
very
stillness
itself
seemed
to
frighten
me
and
i
came
out
of
my
room
and
went
very
softly
downstairs
in
the
anteroom
outside
of
the
marquis
s
chamber
i
found
urbain
walking
up
and
down
he
asked
me
what
i
wanted
and
i
said
i
came
back
to
relieve
my
lady
he
said
would
relieve
my
lady
and
ordered
me
back
to
bed
but
as
i
stood
there
unwilling
to
turn
away
the
door
of
the
room
opened
and
my
lady
came
out
i
noticed
she
was
very
pale
she
was
very
strange
she
looked
a
moment
at
the
count
and
at
me
and
then
she
held
out
her
arms
to
the
count
he
went
to
her
and
she
fell
upon
him
and
hid
her
face
i
went
quickly
past
her
into
the
room
and
to
the
marquis
s
bed
he
was
lying
there
very
white
with
his
eyes
shut
like
a
corpse
i
took
hold
of
his
hand
and
spoke
to
him
and
he
felt
to
me
like
a
dead
man
then
i
turned
round
my
lady
and
urbain
were
there
my
poor
bread
said
my
lady
m
le
marquis
is
urbain
knelt
down
by
the
bed
and
said
softly
père
mon
i
thought
it
wonderful
strange
and
asked
my
lady
what
in
the
world
had
happened
and
why
she
hadn
t
called
me
she
said
nothing
had
happened
that
she
had
only
been
sitting
there
with
the
marquis
very
quiet
she
had
closed
her
eyes
thinking
she
might
sleep
and
she
had
slept
she
didn
t
know
how
long
when
she
woke
up
he
was
dead
it
s
death
my
son
it
s
death
she
said
to
the
count
urbain
said
they
must
have
the
doctor
immediately
from
poitiers
and
that
he
would
ride
off
and
fetch
him
he
kissed
his
father
s
face
and
then
he
kissed
his
mother
and
went
away
my
lady
and
i
stood
there
at
the
bedside
as
i
looked
at
the
poor
marquis
it
came
into
my
head
that
he
was
not
dead
that
he
was
in
a
kind
of
swoon
and
then
my
lady
repeated
my
poor
bread
it
s
death
it
s
death
and
i
said
yes
my
lady
it
s
certainly
i
said
just
the
opposite
to
what
i
believed
it
was
my
notion
then
my
lady
said
we
must
wait
for
the
doctor
and
we
sat
there
and
waited
it
was
a
long
time
the
poor
marquis
neither
stirred
nor
changed
i
have
seen
death
before
said
my
lady
and
it
s
terribly
like
yes
please
my
lady
said
i
and
i
kept
thinking
the
night
wore
away
without
the
count
s
coming
back
and
my
lady
began
to
be
frightened
she
was
afraid
he
had
had
an
accident
in
the
dark
or
met
with
some
wild
people
at
last
she
got
so
restless
that
she
went
below
to
watch
in
the
court
for
her
son
s
return
i
sat
there
alone
and
the
marquis
never
here
mrs
bread
paused
again
and
the
most
artistic
of
romancers
could
not
have
been
more
effective
newman
made
a
movement
as
if
he
were
turning
over
the
page
of
a
novel
so
he
dead
he
exclaimed
three
days
afterwards
he
was
in
his
grave
said
mrs
bread
sententiously
in
a
little
while
i
went
away
to
the
front
of
the
house
and
looked
out
into
the
court
and
there
before
long
i
saw
urbain
ride
in
alone
i
waited
a
bit
to
hear
him
come
upstairs
with
his
mother
but
they
stayed
below
and
i
went
back
to
the
marquis
s
room
i
went
to
the
bed
and
held
up
the
light
to
him
but
i
don
t
know
why
i
didn
t
let
the
candlestick
fall
the
marquis
s
eyes
were
open
open
wide
they
were
staring
at
me
i
knelt
down
beside
him
and
took
his
hands
and
begged
him
to
tell
me
in
the
name
of
wonder
whether
he
was
alive
or
dead
still
he
looked
at
me
a
long
time
and
then
he
made
me
a
sign
to
put
my
ear
close
to
him
i
am
dead
he
said
i
am
dead
the
marquise
has
killed
i
was
all
in
a
tremble
i
didn
t
understand
him
he
seemed
both
a
man
and
a
corpse
if
you
can
fancy
sir
but
you
ll
get
well
now
sir
i
said
and
then
he
whispered
again
ever
so
weak
i
wouldn
t
get
well
for
a
kingdom
i
wouldn
t
be
that
woman
s
husband
and
then
he
said
more
he
said
she
had
murdered
him
i
asked
him
what
she
had
done
to
him
but
he
only
replied
murder
murder
and
she
ll
kill
my
daughter
he
said
my
poor
unhappy
and
he
begged
me
to
prevent
that
and
then
he
said
that
he
was
dying
that
he
was
dead
i
was
afraid
to
move
or
to
leave
him
i
was
almost
dead
myself
all
of
a
sudden
he
asked
me
to
get
a
pencil
and
write
for
him
and
then
i
had
to
tell
him
that
i
couldn
t
manage
a
pencil
he
asked
me
to
hold
him
up
in
bed
while
he
wrote
himself
and
i
said
he
could
never
never
do
such
a
thing
but
he
seemed
to
have
a
kind
of
terror
that
gave
him
strength
i
found
a
pencil
in
the
room
and
a
piece
of
paper
and
a
book
and
i
put
the
paper
on
the
book
and
the
pencil
into
his
hand
and
moved
the
candle
near
him
you
will
think
all
this
very
strange
sir
and
very
strange
it
was
the
strangest
part
of
it
was
that
i
believed
he
was
dying
and
that
i
was
eager
to
help
him
to
write
i
sat
on
the
bed
and
put
my
arm
round
him
and
held
him
up
i
felt
very
strong
i
believe
i
could
have
lifted
him
and
carried
him
it
was
a
wonder
how
he
wrote
but
he
did
write
in
a
big
scratching
hand
he
almost
covered
one
side
of
the
paper
it
seemed
a
long
time
i
suppose
it
was
three
or
four
minutes
he
was
groaning
terribly
all
the
while
then
he
said
it
was
ended
and
i
let
him
down
upon
his
pillows
and
he
gave
me
the
paper
and
told
me
to
fold
it
and
hide
it
and
give
it
to
those
who
would
act
upon
it
whom
do
you
mean
i
said
who
are
those
who
will
act
upon
it
but
he
only
groaned
for
an
answer
he
couldn
t
speak
for
weakness
in
a
few
minutes
he
told
me
to
go
and
look
at
the
bottle
on
the
i
knew
the
bottle
he
meant
the
white
stuff
that
was
good
for
his
stomach
i
went
and
looked
at
it
but
it
was
empty
when
i
came
back
his
eyes
were
open
and
he
was
staring
at
me
but
soon
he
closed
them
and
he
said
no
more
i
hid
the
paper
in
my
dress
i
didn
t
look
at
what
was
written
upon
it
though
i
can
read
very
well
sir
if
i
haven
t
any
handwriting
i
sat
down
near
the
bed
but
it
was
nearly
half
an
hour
before
my
lady
and
the
count
came
in
the
marquis
looked
as
he
did
when
they
left
him
and
i
never
said
a
word
about
his
having
been
otherwise
urbain
said
that
the
doctor
had
been
called
to
a
person
in
childbirth
but
that
he
promised
to
set
out
for
fleurières
immediately
in
another
half
hour
he
arrived
and
as
soon
as
he
had
examined
the
marquis
he
said
that
we
had
had
a
false
alarm
the
poor
gentleman
was
very
low
but
he
was
still
living
i
watched
my
lady
and
her
son
when
he
said
this
to
see
if
they
looked
at
each
other
and
i
am
obliged
to
admit
that
they
didn
t
the
doctor
said
there
was
no
reason
he
should
die
he
had
been
going
on
so
well
and
then
he
wanted
to
know
how
he
had
suddenly
fallen
off
he
had
left
him
so
very
hearty
my
lady
told
her
little
story
again
what
she
had
told
urbain
and
me
and
the
doctor
looked
at
her
and
said
nothing
he
stayed
all
the
next
day
at
the
château
and
hardly
left
the
marquis
i
was
always
there
mademoiselle
and
valentin
came
and
looked
at
their
father
but
he
never
stirred
it
was
a
strange
deathly
stupor
my
lady
was
always
about
her
face
was
as
white
as
her
husband
s
and
she
looked
very
proud
as
i
had
seen
her
look
when
her
orders
or
her
wishes
had
been
disobeyed
it
was
as
if
the
poor
marquis
had
defied
her
and
the
way
she
took
it
made
me
afraid
of
her
the
apothecary
from
poitiers
kept
the
marquis
along
through
the
day
and
we
waited
for
the
other
doctor
from
paris
who
as
i
told
you
had
been
staying
at
fleurières
they
had
telegraphed
for
him
early
in
the
morning
and
in
the
evening
he
arrived
he
talked
a
bit
outside
with
the
doctor
from
poitiers
and
then
they
came
in
to
see
the
marquis
together
i
was
with
him
and
so
was
urbain
my
lady
had
been
to
receive
the
doctor
from
paris
and
she
didn
t
come
back
with
him
into
the
room
he
sat
down
by
the
marquis
i
can
see
him
there
now
with
his
hand
on
the
marquis
s
wrist
and
urbain
watching
him
with
a
little
in
his
hand
i
m
sure
he
s
better
said
the
little
doctor
from
poitiers
i
m
sure
he
ll
come
a
few
moments
after
he
had
said
this
the
marquis
opened
his
eyes
as
if
he
were
waking
up
and
looked
at
us
from
one
to
the
other
i
saw
him
look
at
me
very
softly
as
you
d
say
at
the
same
moment
my
lady
came
in
on
tiptoe
she
came
up
to
the
bed
and
put
in
her
head
between
me
and
the
count
the
marquis
saw
her
and
gave
a
long
most
wonderful
moan
he
said
something
we
couldn
t
understand
and
he
seemed
to
have
a
kind
of
spasm
he
shook
all
over
and
then
closed
his
eyes
and
the
doctor
jumped
up
and
took
hold
of
my
lady
he
held
her
for
a
moment
a
bit
roughly
the
marquis
was
stone
dead
this
time
there
were
those
there
that
newman
felt
as
if
he
had
been
reading
by
starlight
the
report
of
highly
important
evidence
in
a
great
murder
case
and
the
paper
the
paper
he
said
excitedly
what
was
written
upon
it
i
can
t
tell
you
sir
answered
mrs
bread
i
couldn
t
read
it
it
was
in
but
could
no
one
else
read
it
i
never
asked
a
human
no
one
has
ever
seen
it
if
you
see
it
you
ll
be
the
newman
seized
the
old
woman
s
hand
in
both
his
own
and
pressed
it
vigorously
i
thank
you
ever
so
much
for
that
he
cried
i
want
to
be
the
first
i
want
it
to
be
my
property
and
no
one
else
s
you
re
the
wisest
old
woman
in
europe
and
what
did
you
do
with
the
paper
this
information
had
made
him
feel
extraordinarily
strong
give
it
to
me
quick
mrs
bread
got
up
with
a
certain
majesty
it
is
not
so
easy
as
that
sir
if
you
want
the
paper
you
must
but
waiting
is
horrible
you
know
urged
newman
i
am
sure
have
waited
i
have
waited
these
many
years
said
mrs
bread
that
is
very
true
you
have
waited
for
me
i
won
t
forget
it
and
yet
how
comes
it
you
didn
t
do
as
de
bellegarde
said
show
the
paper
to
someone
to
whom
should
i
show
it
answered
mrs
bread
mournfully
it
was
not
easy
to
know
and
many
s
the
night
i
have
lain
awake
thinking
of
it
six
months
afterwards
when
they
married
mademoiselle
to
her
vicious
old
husband
i
was
very
near
bringing
it
out
i
thought
it
was
my
duty
to
do
something
with
it
and
yet
i
was
mightily
afraid
i
didn
t
know
what
was
written
on
the
paper
or
how
bad
it
might
be
and
there
was
no
one
i
could
trust
enough
to
ask
and
it
seemed
to
me
a
cruel
kindness
to
do
that
sweet
young
creature
letting
her
know
that
her
father
had
written
her
mother
down
so
shamefully
for
that
s
what
he
did
i
suppose
i
thought
she
would
rather
be
unhappy
with
her
husband
than
be
unhappy
that
way
it
was
for
her
and
for
my
dear
valentin
i
kept
quiet
quiet
i
call
it
but
for
me
it
was
a
weary
quietness
it
worried
me
terribly
and
it
changed
me
altogether
but
for
others
i
held
my
tongue
and
no
one
to
this
hour
knows
what
passed
between
the
poor
marquis
and
but
evidently
there
were
suspicions
said
newman
where
did
valentin
get
his
ideas
it
was
the
little
doctor
from
poitiers
he
was
very
and
he
made
a
great
talk
he
was
a
sharp
frenchman
and
coming
to
the
house
as
he
did
day
after
day
i
suppose
he
saw
more
than
he
seemed
to
see
and
indeed
the
way
the
poor
marquis
went
off
as
soon
as
his
eyes
fell
on
my
lady
was
a
most
shocking
sight
for
anyone
the
medical
gentleman
from
paris
was
much
more
accommodating
and
he
hushed
up
the
other
but
for
all
he
could
do
valentin
and
mademoiselle
heard
something
they
knew
their
father
s
death
was
somehow
against
nature
of
course
they
couldn
t
accuse
their
mother
and
as
i
tell
you
i
was
as
dumb
as
that
stone
valentin
used
to
look
at
me
sometimes
and
his
eyes
seemed
to
shine
as
if
he
were
thinking
of
asking
me
something
i
was
dreadfully
afraid
he
would
speak
and
i
always
looked
away
and
went
about
my
business
if
i
were
to
tell
him
i
was
sure
he
would
hate
me
afterwards
and
that
i
could
never
have
borne
once
i
went
up
to
him
and
took
a
great
liberty
i
kissed
him
as
i
had
kissed
him
when
he
was
a
child
you
oughtn
t
to
look
so
sad
sir
i
said
believe
your
poor
old
bread
such
a
gallant
handsome
young
man
can
have
nothing
to
be
sad
and
i
think
he
understood
me
he
understood
that
i
was
begging
off
and
he
made
up
his
mind
in
his
own
way
he
went
about
with
his
unasked
question
in
his
mind
as
i
did
with
my
untold
tale
we
were
both
afraid
of
bringing
dishonor
on
a
great
house
and
it
was
the
same
with
mademoiselle
she
didn
t
know
what
happened
she
wouldn
t
know
my
lady
and
urbain
asked
me
no
questions
because
they
had
no
reason
i
was
as
still
as
a
mouse
when
i
was
younger
my
lady
thought
me
a
hussy
and
now
she
thought
me
a
fool
how
should
i
have
any
ideas
but
you
say
the
little
doctor
from
poitiers
made
a
talk
said
newman
did
no
one
take
it
up
i
heard
nothing
of
it
sir
they
are
always
talking
scandal
in
these
foreign
countries
you
may
have
noticed
and
i
suppose
they
shook
their
heads
over
madame
de
bellegarde
but
after
all
what
could
they
say
the
marquis
had
been
ill
and
the
marquis
had
died
he
had
as
good
a
right
to
die
as
anyone
the
doctor
couldn
t
say
he
had
not
come
honestly
by
his
cramps
the
next
year
the
little
doctor
left
the
place
and
bought
a
practice
in
bordeaux
and
if
there
has
been
any
gossip
it
died
out
and
i
don
t
think
there
could
have
been
much
gossip
about
my
lady
that
anyone
would
listen
to
my
lady
is
so
very
newman
at
this
last
affirmation
broke
into
an
immense
resounding
laugh
mrs
bread
had
begun
to
move
away
from
the
spot
where
they
were
sitting
and
he
helped
her
through
the
aperture
in
the
wall
and
along
the
homeward
path
yes
he
said
my
lady
s
respectability
is
delicious
it
will
be
a
great
crash
they
reached
the
empty
space
in
front
of
the
church
where
they
stopped
a
moment
looking
at
each
other
with
something
of
an
air
of
closer
fellowship
like
two
sociable
conspirators
but
what
was
it
said
newman
what
was
it
she
did
to
her
husband
she
didn
t
stab
him
or
poison
i
don
t
know
sir
no
one
saw
unless
it
was
urbain
you
say
he
was
walking
up
and
down
outside
the
room
perhaps
he
looked
through
the
keyhole
but
no
i
think
that
with
his
mother
he
would
take
it
on
you
may
be
sure
i
have
often
thought
of
it
said
mrs
bread
i
am
sure
she
didn
t
touch
him
with
her
hands
i
saw
nothing
on
him
anywhere
i
believe
it
was
in
this
way
he
had
a
fit
of
his
great
pain
and
he
asked
her
for
his
medicine
instead
of
giving
it
to
him
she
went
and
poured
it
away
before
his
eyes
then
he
saw
what
she
meant
and
weak
and
helpless
as
he
was
he
was
frightened
he
was
terrified
you
want
to
kill
me
he
said
yes
le
marquis
i
want
to
kill
you
says
my
lady
and
sits
down
and
fixes
her
eyes
upon
him
you
know
my
lady
s
eyes
i
think
sir
it
was
with
them
she
killed
him
it
was
with
the
terrible
strong
will
she
put
into
them
it
was
like
a
frost
on
well
you
are
a
very
intelligent
woman
you
have
shown
great
discretion
said
newman
i
shall
value
your
services
as
housekeeper
they
had
begun
to
descend
the
hill
and
mrs
bread
said
nothing
until
they
reached
the
foot
newman
strolled
lightly
beside
her
his
head
was
thrown
back
and
he
was
gazing
at
all
the
stars
he
seemed
to
himself
to
be
riding
his
vengeance
along
the
milky
way
so
you
are
serious
sir
about
that
said
mrs
bread
softly
about
your
living
with
me
why
of
course
i
will
take
care
of
you
to
the
end
of
your
days
you
can
t
live
with
those
people
any
longer
and
you
oughtn
t
to
you
know
after
this
you
give
me
the
paper
and
you
move
it
seems
very
flighty
in
me
to
be
taking
a
new
place
at
this
time
of
life
observed
mrs
bread
lugubriously
but
if
you
are
going
to
turn
the
house
upside
down
i
would
rather
be
out
of
oh
said
newman
in
the
cheerful
tone
of
a
man
who
feels
rich
in
alternatives
i
don
t
think
i
shall
bring
in
the
constables
if
that
s
what
you
mean
whatever
madame
de
bellegarde
did
i
am
afraid
the
law
can
t
take
hold
of
it
but
i
am
glad
of
that
it
leaves
it
altogether
to
me
you
are
a
mighty
bold
gentleman
sir
murmured
mrs
bread
looking
at
him
round
the
edge
of
her
great
bonnet
he
walked
with
her
back
to
the
château
the
curfew
had
tolled
for
the
laborious
villagers
of
fleurières
and
the
street
was
unlighted
and
empty
she
promised
him
that
he
should
have
the
marquis
s
manuscript
in
half
an
hour
mrs
bread
choosing
not
to
go
in
by
the
great
gate
they
passed
round
by
a
winding
lane
to
a
door
in
the
wall
of
the
park
of
which
she
had
the
key
and
which
would
enable
her
to
enter
the
château
from
behind
newman
arranged
with
her
that
he
should
await
outside
the
wall
her
return
with
the
coveted
document
she
went
in
and
his
half
hour
in
the
dusky
lane
seemed
very
long
but
he
had
plenty
to
think
about
at
last
the
door
in
the
wall
opened
and
mrs
bread
stood
there
with
one
hand
on
the
latch
and
the
other
holding
out
a
scrap
of
white
paper
folded
small
in
a
moment
he
was
master
of
it
and
it
had
passed
into
his
waistcoat
pocket
come
and
see
me
in
paris
he
said
we
are
to
settle
your
future
you
know
and
i
will
translate
poor
de
bellegarde
s
french
to
never
had
he
felt
so
grateful
as
at
this
moment
for
nioche
s
instructions
bread
s
dull
eyes
had
followed
the
disappearance
of
the
paper
and
she
gave
a
heavy
sigh
well
you
have
done
what
you
would
with
me
sir
and
i
suppose
you
will
do
it
again
you
take
care
of
me
now
you
are
a
terribly
positive
just
now
said
newman
i
m
a
terribly
impatient
gentleman
and
he
bade
her
and
walked
rapidly
back
to
the
inn
he
ordered
his
vehicle
to
be
prepared
for
his
return
to
poitiers
and
then
he
shut
the
door
of
the
common
salle
and
strode
toward
the
solitary
lamp
on
the
he
pulled
out
the
paper
and
quickly
unfolded
it
it
was
covered
with
which
at
first
in
the
feeble
light
seemed
indistinct
but
newman
s
fierce
curiosity
forced
a
meaning
from
the
tremulous
signs
the
english
of
them
was
as
follows
my
wife
has
tried
to
kill
me
and
she
has
done
it
i
am
dying
dying
horribly
it
is
to
marry
my
dear
daughter
to
de
cintré
with
all
my
soul
i
protest
i
forbid
it
i
am
not
insane
ask
the
doctors
ask
b
it
was
alone
with
me
here
she
attacked
me
and
put
me
to
death
it
is
murder
if
murder
ever
was
ask
the
doctors
de
bellegarde
chapter
xxiii
newman
returned
to
paris
the
second
day
after
his
interview
with
mrs
bread
the
morrow
he
had
spent
at
poitiers
reading
over
and
over
again
the
little
document
which
he
had
lodged
in
his
and
thinking
what
he
would
do
in
the
circumstances
and
how
he
would
do
it
he
would
not
have
said
that
poitiers
was
an
amusing
place
yet
the
day
seemed
very
short
domiciled
once
more
in
the
boulevard
haussmann
he
walked
over
to
the
rue
de
l
université
and
inquired
of
madame
de
bellegarde
s
portress
whether
the
marquise
had
come
back
the
portress
told
him
that
she
had
arrived
with
le
marquis
on
the
preceding
day
and
further
informed
him
that
if
he
desired
to
enter
madame
de
bellegarde
and
her
son
were
both
at
home
as
she
said
these
words
the
little
old
woman
who
peered
out
of
the
dusky
of
the
hôtel
de
bellegarde
gave
a
small
wicked
smile
a
smile
which
seemed
to
newman
to
mean
go
in
if
you
dare
she
was
evidently
versed
in
the
current
domestic
history
she
was
placed
where
she
could
feel
the
pulse
of
the
house
newman
stood
a
moment
twisting
his
moustache
and
looking
at
her
then
he
abruptly
turned
away
but
this
was
not
because
he
was
afraid
to
go
in
though
he
doubted
whether
if
he
did
so
he
should
be
able
to
make
his
way
unchallenged
into
the
presence
of
madame
de
cintré
s
relatives
confidence
excessive
confidence
perhaps
quite
as
much
as
timidity
prompted
his
retreat
he
was
nursing
his
thunderbolt
he
loved
it
he
was
unwilling
to
part
with
it
he
seemed
to
be
holding
it
aloft
in
the
rumbling
air
directly
over
the
heads
of
his
victims
and
he
fancied
he
could
see
their
pale
upturned
faces
few
specimens
of
the
human
countenance
had
ever
given
him
such
pleasure
as
these
lighted
in
the
lurid
fashion
i
have
hinted
at
and
he
was
disposed
to
sip
the
cup
of
contemplative
revenge
in
a
leisurely
fashion
it
must
be
added
too
that
he
was
at
a
loss
to
see
exactly
how
he
could
arrange
to
witness
the
operation
of
his
thunder
to
send
in
his
card
to
madame
de
bellegarde
would
be
a
waste
of
ceremony
she
would
certainly
decline
to
receive
him
on
the
other
hand
he
could
not
force
his
way
into
her
presence
it
annoyed
him
keenly
to
think
that
he
might
be
reduced
to
the
blind
satisfaction
of
writing
her
a
letter
but
he
consoled
himself
in
a
measure
with
the
reflection
that
a
letter
might
lead
to
an
interview
he
went
home
and
feeling
rather
tired
nursing
a
vengeance
was
it
must
be
confessed
a
rather
fatiguing
process
it
took
a
good
deal
out
of
one
flung
himself
into
one
of
his
brocaded
fauteuils
stretched
his
legs
thrust
his
hands
into
his
pockets
and
while
he
watched
the
reflected
sunset
fading
from
the
ornate
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
boulevard
began
mentally
to
compose
a
cool
epistle
to
madame
de
bellegarde
while
he
was
so
occupied
his
servant
threw
open
the
door
and
announced
ceremoniously
madame
brett
newman
roused
himself
expectantly
and
in
a
few
moments
perceived
upon
his
threshold
the
worthy
woman
with
whom
he
had
conversed
to
such
good
purpose
on
the
starlit
of
fleurières
mrs
bread
had
made
for
this
visit
the
same
toilet
as
for
her
former
expedition
newman
was
struck
with
her
distinguished
appearance
his
lamp
was
not
lit
and
as
her
large
grave
face
gazed
at
him
through
the
light
dusk
from
under
the
shadow
of
her
ample
bonnet
he
felt
the
incongruity
of
such
a
person
presenting
herself
as
a
servant
he
greeted
her
with
high
geniality
and
bade
her
come
in
and
sit
down
and
make
herself
comfortable
there
was
something
which
might
have
touched
the
springs
both
of
mirth
and
of
melancholy
in
the
ancient
maidenliness
with
which
mrs
bread
endeavored
to
comply
with
these
directions
she
was
not
playing
at
being
fluttered
which
would
have
been
simply
ridiculous
she
was
doing
her
best
to
carry
herself
as
a
person
so
humble
that
for
her
even
embarrassment
would
have
been
pretentious
but
evidently
she
had
never
dreamed
of
its
being
in
her
horoscope
to
pay
a
visit
at
to
a
friendly
single
gentleman
who
lived
in
rooms
on
one
of
the
new
boulevards
i
truly
hope
i
am
not
forgetting
my
place
sir
she
murmured
forgetting
your
place
cried
newman
why
you
are
remembering
it
this
is
your
place
you
know
you
are
already
in
my
service
your
wages
as
housekeeper
began
a
fortnight
ago
i
can
tell
you
my
house
wants
keeping
why
don
t
you
take
off
your
bonnet
and
stay
take
off
my
bonnet
said
mrs
bread
with
timid
literalness
oh
sir
i
haven
t
my
cap
and
with
your
leave
sir
i
couldn
t
keep
house
in
my
best
never
mind
your
gown
said
newman
cheerfully
you
shall
have
a
better
gown
than
mrs
bread
stared
solemnly
and
then
stretched
her
hands
over
her
lustreless
satin
skirt
as
if
the
perilous
side
of
her
situation
were
defining
itself
oh
sir
i
am
fond
of
my
own
clothes
she
murmured
i
hope
you
have
left
those
wicked
people
at
any
rate
said
newman
well
sir
here
i
am
said
mrs
bread
that
s
all
i
can
tell
you
here
i
sit
poor
catherine
bread
it
s
a
strange
place
for
me
to
be
i
don
t
know
myself
i
never
supposed
i
was
so
bold
but
indeed
sir
i
have
gone
as
far
as
my
own
strength
will
bear
oh
come
bread
said
newman
almost
caressingly
don
t
make
yourself
uncomfortable
now
s
the
time
to
feel
lively
you
she
began
to
speak
again
with
a
trembling
voice
i
think
it
would
be
more
respectable
if
i
could
if
i
could
and
her
voice
trembled
to
a
pause
if
you
could
give
up
this
sort
of
thing
altogether
said
newman
kindly
trying
to
anticipate
her
meaning
which
he
supposed
might
be
a
wish
to
retire
from
service
if
i
could
give
up
everything
sir
all
i
should
ask
is
a
decent
protestant
burial
cried
newman
with
a
burst
of
laughter
why
to
bury
you
now
would
be
a
sad
piece
of
extravagance
it
s
only
rascals
who
have
to
be
buried
to
get
respectable
honest
folks
like
you
and
me
can
live
our
time
out
and
live
together
come
did
you
bring
your
baggage
my
box
is
locked
and
corded
but
i
haven
t
yet
spoken
to
my
speak
to
her
then
and
have
done
with
it
i
should
like
to
have
your
chance
cried
newman
i
would
gladly
give
it
you
sir
i
have
passed
some
weary
hours
in
my
lady
s
but
this
will
be
one
of
the
longest
she
will
tax
me
with
well
said
newman
so
long
as
you
can
tax
her
with
murder
oh
sir
i
can
t
not
i
sighed
mrs
bread
you
don
t
mean
to
say
anything
about
it
so
much
the
better
leave
that
to
if
she
calls
me
a
thankless
old
woman
said
mrs
bread
i
shall
have
nothing
to
say
but
it
is
better
so
she
softly
added
she
shall
be
my
lady
to
the
last
that
will
be
more
and
then
you
will
come
to
me
and
i
shall
be
your
gentleman
said
newman
that
will
be
more
respectable
still
mrs
bread
rose
with
lowered
eyes
and
stood
a
moment
then
looking
up
she
rested
her
eyes
upon
newman
s
face
the
disordered
proprieties
were
somehow
settling
to
rest
she
looked
at
newman
so
long
and
so
fixedly
with
such
a
dull
intense
devotedness
that
he
himself
might
have
had
a
pretext
for
embarrassment
at
last
she
said
gently
you
are
not
looking
well
that
s
natural
enough
said
newman
i
have
nothing
to
feel
well
about
to
be
very
indifferent
and
very
fierce
very
dull
and
very
jovial
very
sick
and
very
lively
all
at
once
why
it
rather
mixes
one
mrs
bread
gave
a
noiseless
sigh
i
can
tell
you
something
that
will
make
you
feel
duller
still
if
you
want
to
feel
all
one
way
about
madame
de
what
can
you
tell
me
newman
demanded
not
that
you
have
seen
her
she
shook
her
head
no
indeed
sir
nor
ever
shall
that
s
the
dullness
of
it
nor
my
lady
nor
de
you
mean
that
she
is
kept
so
close
close
said
mrs
bread
very
softly
these
words
for
an
instant
seemed
to
check
the
beating
of
newman
s
heart
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
staring
up
at
the
old
woman
they
have
tried
to
see
her
and
she
wouldn
t
she
couldn
t
she
refused
forever
i
had
it
from
my
lady
s
own
maid
said
mrs
bread
who
had
it
from
my
lady
to
speak
of
it
to
such
a
person
my
lady
must
have
felt
the
shock
madame
de
cintré
won
t
see
them
now
and
now
is
her
only
chance
a
while
hence
she
will
have
no
you
mean
the
other
women
the
mothers
the
daughters
the
sisters
what
is
it
they
call
them
won
t
let
her
it
is
what
they
call
the
rule
of
the
house
or
of
the
order
i
believe
said
mrs
bread
there
is
no
rule
so
strict
as
that
of
the
carmelites
the
bad
women
in
the
reformatories
are
fine
ladies
to
them
they
wear
old
brown
cloaks
so
the
de
told
me
that
you
wouldn
t
use
for
a
horse
blanket
and
the
poor
countess
was
so
fond
of
dresses
she
would
never
have
anything
stiff
they
sleep
on
the
ground
mrs
bread
went
on
they
are
no
better
no
better
and
she
hesitated
for
a
comparison
they
are
no
better
than
tinkers
wives
they
give
up
everything
down
to
the
very
name
their
poor
old
nurses
called
them
by
they
give
up
father
and
mother
brother
and
sister
to
say
nothing
of
other
persons
mrs
bread
delicately
added
they
wear
a
shroud
under
their
brown
cloaks
and
a
rope
round
their
waists
and
they
get
up
on
winter
nights
and
go
off
into
cold
places
to
pray
to
the
virgin
mary
the
virgin
mary
is
a
hard
mistress
mrs
bread
dwelling
on
these
terrible
facts
sat
and
pale
with
her
hands
clasped
in
her
satin
lap
newman
gave
a
melancholy
groan
and
fell
forward
leaning
his
head
on
his
hands
there
was
a
long
silence
broken
only
by
the
ticking
of
the
great
gilded
clock
on
the
where
is
this
place
where
is
the
convent
newman
asked
at
last
looking
up
there
are
two
houses
said
mrs
bread
i
found
out
i
thought
you
would
like
to
know
though
it
s
poor
comfort
i
think
one
is
in
the
avenue
de
messine
they
have
learned
that
madame
de
cintré
is
there
the
other
is
in
the
rue
d
enfer
that
s
a
terrible
name
i
suppose
you
know
what
it
newman
got
up
and
walked
away
to
the
end
of
his
long
room
when
he
came
back
mrs
bread
had
got
up
and
stood
by
the
fire
with
folded
hands
tell
me
this
he
said
can
i
get
near
her
even
if
i
don
t
see
her
can
i
look
through
a
grating
or
some
such
thing
at
the
place
where
she
is
it
is
said
that
all
women
love
a
lover
and
bread
s
sense
of
the
harmony
which
kept
servants
in
their
place
even
as
planets
in
their
orbits
not
that
mrs
bread
had
ever
consciously
likened
herself
to
a
planet
barely
availed
to
temper
the
maternal
melancholy
with
which
she
leaned
her
head
on
one
side
and
gazed
at
her
new
employer
she
probably
felt
for
the
moment
as
if
forty
years
before
she
had
held
him
also
in
her
arms
that
wouldn
t
help
you
sir
it
would
only
make
her
seem
farther
i
want
to
go
there
at
all
events
said
newman
avenue
de
messine
you
say
and
what
is
it
they
call
themselves
carmelites
said
mrs
bread
i
shall
remember
mrs
bread
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
it
s
my
duty
to
tell
you
this
sir
she
went
on
the
convent
has
a
chapel
and
some
people
are
admitted
on
sunday
to
the
mass
you
don
t
see
the
poor
creatures
that
are
shut
up
there
but
i
am
told
you
can
hear
them
sing
it
s
a
wonder
they
have
any
heart
for
singing
some
sunday
i
shall
make
bold
to
go
it
seems
to
me
i
should
know
voice
in
newman
looked
at
his
visitor
very
gratefully
then
he
held
out
his
hand
and
shook
hers
thank
you
he
said
if
anyone
can
get
in
i
a
moment
later
mrs
bread
proposed
deferentially
to
retire
but
he
checked
her
and
put
a
lighted
candle
into
her
hand
there
are
half
a
dozen
rooms
there
i
don
t
use
he
said
pointing
through
an
open
door
go
and
look
at
them
and
take
your
choice
you
can
live
in
the
one
you
like
from
this
bewildering
opportunity
mrs
bread
at
first
recoiled
but
finally
yielding
to
newman
s
gentle
reassuring
push
she
wandered
off
into
the
dusk
with
her
tremulous
taper
she
remained
absent
a
quarter
of
an
hour
during
which
newman
paced
up
and
down
stopped
occasionally
to
look
out
of
the
window
at
the
lights
on
the
boulevard
and
then
resumed
his
walk
bread
s
relish
for
her
investigation
apparently
increased
as
she
proceeded
but
at
last
she
reappeared
and
deposited
her
candlestick
on
the
well
have
you
picked
one
out
asked
newman
a
room
sir
they
are
all
too
fine
for
a
dingy
old
body
like
me
there
isn
t
one
that
hasn
t
a
bit
of
it
s
only
tinsel
bread
said
newman
if
you
stay
there
a
while
it
will
all
peel
off
of
and
he
gave
a
dismal
smile
oh
sir
there
are
things
enough
peeling
off
already
rejoined
mrs
bread
with
a
since
i
was
there
i
thought
i
would
look
about
me
i
don
t
believe
you
know
sir
the
corners
are
most
dreadful
you
do
want
a
housekeeper
that
you
do
you
want
a
tidy
englishwoman
that
isn
t
above
taking
hold
of
a
newman
assured
her
that
he
suspected
if
he
had
not
measured
his
domestic
abuses
and
that
to
reform
them
was
a
mission
worthy
of
her
powers
she
held
her
candlestick
aloft
again
and
looked
around
the
salon
with
compassionate
glances
then
she
intimated
that
she
accepted
the
mission
and
that
its
sacred
character
would
sustain
her
in
her
rupture
with
madame
de
bellegarde
with
this
she
curtsied
herself
away
she
came
back
the
next
day
with
her
worldly
goods
and
newman
going
into
his
found
her
upon
her
aged
knees
before
a
divan
sewing
up
some
detached
fringe
he
questioned
her
as
to
her
with
her
late
mistress
and
she
said
it
had
proved
easier
than
she
feared
i
was
perfectly
civil
sir
but
the
lord
helped
me
to
remember
that
a
good
woman
has
no
call
to
tremble
before
a
bad
i
should
think
so
cried
newman
and
does
she
know
you
have
come
to
me
she
asked
me
where
i
was
going
and
i
mentioned
your
name
said
mrs
bread
what
did
she
say
to
that
she
looked
at
me
very
hard
and
she
turned
very
red
then
she
bade
me
leave
her
i
was
all
ready
to
go
and
i
had
got
the
coachman
who
is
an
englishman
to
bring
down
my
poor
box
and
to
fetch
me
a
cab
but
when
i
went
down
myself
to
the
gate
i
found
it
closed
my
lady
had
sent
orders
to
the
porter
not
to
let
me
pass
and
by
the
same
orders
the
porter
s
wife
she
is
a
dreadful
sly
old
body
had
gone
out
in
a
cab
to
fetch
home
de
bellegarde
from
his
newman
slapped
his
knee
she
scared
she
scared
he
cried
exultantly
i
was
frightened
too
sir
said
mrs
bread
but
i
was
also
mightily
vexed
i
took
it
very
high
with
the
porter
and
asked
him
by
what
right
he
used
violence
to
an
honorable
englishwoman
who
had
lived
in
the
house
for
thirty
years
before
he
was
heard
of
oh
sir
i
was
very
grand
and
i
brought
the
man
down
he
drew
his
bolts
and
let
me
out
and
i
promised
the
cabman
something
handsome
if
he
would
drive
fast
but
he
was
terribly
slow
it
seemed
as
if
we
should
never
reach
your
blessed
door
i
am
all
of
a
tremble
still
it
took
me
five
minutes
just
now
to
thread
my
newman
told
her
with
a
gleeful
laugh
that
if
she
chose
she
might
have
a
little
maid
on
purpose
to
thread
her
needles
and
he
went
away
murmuring
to
himself
again
that
the
old
woman
scared
she
scared
he
had
not
shown
tristram
the
little
paper
that
he
carried
in
his
but
since
his
return
to
paris
he
had
seen
her
several
times
and
she
had
told
him
that
he
seemed
to
her
to
be
in
a
strange
way
an
even
stranger
way
than
his
sad
situation
made
natural
had
his
disappointment
gone
to
his
head
he
looked
like
a
man
who
was
going
to
be
ill
and
yet
she
had
never
seen
him
more
restless
and
active
one
day
he
would
sit
hanging
his
head
and
looking
as
if
he
were
firmly
resolved
never
to
smile
again
another
he
would
indulge
in
laughter
that
was
almost
unseemly
and
make
jokes
that
were
bad
even
for
him
if
he
was
trying
to
carry
off
his
sorrow
he
at
such
times
really
went
too
far
she
begged
him
of
all
things
not
to
be
feeling
in
a
measure
responsible
as
she
did
for
the
affair
which
had
turned
out
so
ill
for
him
she
could
endure
anything
but
his
strangeness
he
might
be
melancholy
if
he
would
or
he
might
be
stoical
he
might
be
cross
and
cantankerous
with
her
and
ask
her
why
she
had
ever
dared
to
meddle
with
his
destiny
to
this
she
would
submit
for
this
she
would
make
allowances
only
for
heaven
s
sake
let
him
not
be
incoherent
that
would
be
extremely
unpleasant
it
was
like
people
talking
in
their
sleep
they
always
frightened
her
and
tristram
intimated
that
taking
very
high
ground
as
regards
the
moral
obligation
which
events
had
laid
upon
her
she
proposed
not
to
rest
quiet
until
she
should
have
confronted
him
with
the
least
inadequate
substitute
for
madame
de
cintré
that
the
two
hemispheres
contained
oh
said
newman
we
are
even
now
and
we
had
better
not
open
a
new
account
you
may
bury
me
some
day
but
you
shall
never
marry
me
it
s
too
rough
i
hope
at
any
rate
he
added
that
there
is
nothing
incoherent
in
this
that
i
want
to
go
next
sunday
to
the
carmelite
chapel
in
the
avenue
de
messine
you
know
one
of
the
catholic
ministers
an
abbé
is
that
it
i
have
seen
him
here
you
know
that
motherly
old
gentleman
with
the
big
waistband
please
ask
him
if
i
need
a
special
leave
to
go
in
and
if
i
do
beg
him
to
obtain
it
for
tristram
gave
expression
to
the
liveliest
joy
i
am
so
glad
you
have
asked
me
to
do
something
she
cried
you
shall
get
into
the
chapel
if
the
abbé
is
disfrocked
for
his
share
in
and
two
days
afterwards
she
told
him
that
it
was
all
arranged
the
abbé
was
enchanted
to
serve
him
and
if
he
would
present
himself
civilly
at
the
convent
gate
there
would
be
no
difficulty
chapter
xxiv
sunday
was
as
yet
two
days
off
but
meanwhile
to
beguile
his
impatience
newman
took
his
way
to
the
avenue
de
messine
and
got
what
comfort
he
could
in
staring
at
the
blank
outer
wall
of
madame
de
cintré
s
present
residence
the
street
in
question
as
some
travelers
will
remember
adjoins
the
parc
monceau
which
is
one
of
the
prettiest
corners
of
paris
the
quarter
has
an
air
of
modern
opulence
and
convenience
which
seems
at
variance
with
the
ascetic
institution
and
the
impression
made
upon
newman
s
gaze
by
the
windowless
expanse
behind
which
the
woman
he
loved
was
perhaps
even
then
pledging
herself
to
pass
the
rest
of
her
days
was
less
exasperating
than
he
had
feared
the
place
suggested
a
convent
with
the
modern
improvements
an
asylum
in
which
privacy
though
unbroken
might
be
not
quite
identical
with
privation
and
meditation
though
monotonous
might
be
of
a
cheerful
cast
and
yet
he
knew
the
case
was
otherwise
only
at
present
it
was
not
a
reality
to
him
it
was
too
strange
and
too
mocking
to
be
real
it
was
like
a
page
torn
out
of
a
romance
with
no
context
in
his
own
experience
on
sunday
morning
at
the
hour
which
tristram
had
indicated
he
rang
at
the
gate
in
the
blank
wall
it
instantly
opened
and
admitted
him
into
a
clean
court
from
beyond
which
a
dull
plain
edifice
looked
down
upon
him
a
robust
lay
sister
with
a
cheerful
complexion
emerged
from
a
porter
s
lodge
and
on
his
stating
his
errand
pointed
to
the
open
door
of
the
chapel
an
edifice
which
occupied
the
right
side
of
the
court
and
was
preceded
by
the
high
flight
of
steps
newman
ascended
the
steps
and
immediately
entered
the
open
door
service
had
not
yet
begun
the
place
was
dimly
lighted
and
it
was
some
moments
before
he
could
distinguish
its
features
then
he
saw
it
was
divided
by
a
large
close
iron
screen
into
two
unequal
portions
the
altar
was
on
the
hither
side
of
the
screen
and
between
it
and
the
entrance
were
disposed
several
benches
and
chairs
three
or
four
of
these
were
occupied
by
vague
motionless
figures
figures
that
he
presently
perceived
to
be
women
deeply
absorbed
in
their
devotion
the
place
seemed
to
newman
very
cold
the
smell
of
the
incense
itself
was
cold
besides
this
there
was
a
twinkle
of
tapers
and
here
and
there
a
glow
of
colored
glass
newman
seated
himself
the
praying
women
kept
still
with
their
backs
turned
he
saw
they
were
visitors
like
himself
and
he
would
have
liked
to
see
their
faces
for
he
believed
that
they
were
the
mourning
mothers
and
sisters
of
other
women
who
had
had
the
same
pitiless
courage
as
madame
de
cintré
but
they
were
better
off
than
he
for
they
at
least
shared
the
faith
to
which
the
others
had
sacrificed
themselves
three
or
four
persons
came
in
two
of
them
were
elderly
gentlemen
everyone
was
very
quiet
newman
fastened
his
eyes
upon
the
screen
behind
the
altar
that
was
the
convent
the
real
convent
the
place
where
she
was
but
he
could
see
nothing
no
light
came
through
the
crevices
he
got
up
and
approached
the
partition
very
gently
trying
to
look
through
but
behind
it
there
was
darkness
with
nothing
stirring
he
went
back
to
his
place
and
after
that
a
priest
and
two
altar
boys
came
in
and
began
to
say
mass
newman
watched
their
genuflections
and
gyrations
with
a
grim
still
enmity
they
seemed
aids
and
abettors
of
madame
de
cintré
s
desertion
they
were
mouthing
and
droning
out
their
triumph
the
priest
s
long
dismal
intonings
acted
upon
his
nerves
and
deepened
his
wrath
there
was
something
defiant
in
his
unintelligible
drawl
it
seemed
meant
for
newman
himself
suddenly
there
arose
from
the
depths
of
the
chapel
from
behind
the
inexorable
grating
a
sound
which
drew
his
attention
from
the
altar
the
sound
of
a
strange
lugubrious
chant
uttered
by
women
s
voices
it
began
softly
but
it
presently
grew
louder
and
as
it
increased
it
became
more
of
a
wail
and
a
dirge
it
was
the
chant
of
the
carmelite
nuns
their
only
human
utterance
it
was
their
dirge
over
their
buried
affections
and
over
the
vanity
of
earthly
desires
at
first
newman
was
bewildered
almost
stunned
by
the
strangeness
of
the
sound
then
as
he
comprehended
its
meaning
he
listened
intently
and
his
heart
began
to
throb
he
listened
for
madame
de
cintré
s
voice
and
in
the
very
heart
of
the
tuneless
harmony
he
imagined
he
made
it
out
we
are
obliged
to
believe
that
he
was
wrong
inasmuch
as
she
had
obviously
not
yet
had
time
to
become
a
member
of
the
invisible
sisterhood
the
chant
kept
on
mechanical
and
monotonous
with
dismal
repetitions
and
despairing
cadences
it
was
hideous
it
was
horrible
as
it
continued
newman
felt
that
he
needed
all
his
he
was
growing
more
agitated
he
felt
tears
in
his
eyes
at
last
as
in
its
full
force
the
thought
came
over
him
that
this
confused
impersonal
wail
was
all
that
either
he
or
the
world
she
had
deserted
should
ever
hear
of
the
voice
he
had
found
so
sweet
he
felt
that
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
he
rose
abruptly
and
made
his
way
out
on
the
threshold
he
paused
listened
again
to
the
dreary
strain
and
then
hastily
descended
into
the
court
as
he
did
so
he
saw
the
good
sister
with
the
cheeks
and
the
fanlike
frill
to
her
coiffure
who
had
admitted
him
was
in
conference
at
the
gate
with
two
persons
who
had
just
come
in
a
second
glance
informed
him
that
these
persons
were
madame
de
bellegarde
and
her
son
and
that
they
were
about
to
avail
themselves
of
that
method
of
approach
to
madame
de
cintré
which
newman
had
found
but
a
mockery
of
consolation
as
he
crossed
the
court
de
bellegarde
recognized
him
the
marquis
was
coming
to
the
steps
leading
his
mother
the
old
lady
also
gave
newman
a
look
and
it
resembled
that
of
her
son
both
faces
expressed
a
franker
perturbation
something
more
akin
to
the
humbleness
of
dismay
than
newman
had
yet
seen
in
them
evidently
he
startled
the
bellegardes
and
they
had
not
their
grand
behavior
immediately
in
hand
newman
hurried
past
them
guided
only
by
the
desire
to
get
out
of
the
convent
walls
and
into
the
street
the
gate
opened
itself
at
his
approach
he
strode
over
the
threshold
and
it
closed
behind
him
a
carriage
which
appeared
to
have
been
standing
there
was
just
turning
away
from
the
sidewalk
newman
looked
at
it
for
a
moment
blankly
then
he
became
conscious
through
the
dusky
mist
that
swam
before
his
eyes
that
a
lady
seated
in
it
was
bowing
to
him
the
vehicle
had
turned
away
before
he
recognized
her
it
was
an
ancient
landau
with
one
half
the
cover
lowered
the
lady
s
bow
was
very
positive
and
accompanied
with
a
smile
a
little
girl
was
seated
beside
her
he
raised
his
hat
and
then
the
lady
bade
the
coachman
stop
the
carriage
halted
again
beside
the
pavement
and
she
sat
there
and
beckoned
to
newman
beckoned
with
the
demonstrative
grace
of
madame
urbain
de
bellegarde
newman
hesitated
a
moment
before
he
obeyed
her
summons
during
this
moment
he
had
time
to
curse
his
stupidity
for
letting
the
others
escape
him
he
had
been
wondering
how
he
could
get
at
them
fool
that
he
was
for
not
stopping
them
then
and
there
what
better
place
than
beneath
the
very
prison
walls
to
which
they
had
consigned
the
promise
of
his
joy
he
had
been
too
bewildered
to
stop
them
but
now
he
felt
ready
to
wait
for
them
at
the
gate
madame
urbain
with
a
certain
attractive
petulance
beckoned
to
him
again
and
this
time
he
went
over
to
the
carriage
she
leaned
out
and
gave
him
her
hand
looking
at
him
kindly
and
smiling
ah
monsieur
she
said
you
don
t
include
me
in
your
wrath
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
oh
i
don
t
suppose
could
have
prevented
it
newman
answered
in
a
tone
which
was
not
that
of
studied
gallantry
what
you
say
is
too
true
for
me
to
resent
the
small
account
it
makes
of
my
influence
i
forgive
you
at
any
rate
because
you
look
as
if
you
had
seen
a
i
have
said
newman
i
am
glad
then
i
didn
t
go
in
with
madame
de
bellegarde
and
my
husband
you
must
have
seen
them
eh
was
the
meeting
affectionate
did
you
hear
the
chanting
they
say
it
s
like
the
lamentations
of
the
damned
i
wouldn
t
go
in
one
is
certain
to
hear
that
soon
enough
poor
claire
in
a
white
shroud
and
a
big
brown
cloak
that
s
the
of
the
carmelites
you
know
well
she
was
always
fond
of
long
loose
things
but
i
must
not
speak
of
her
to
you
only
i
must
say
that
i
am
very
sorry
for
you
that
if
i
could
have
helped
you
i
would
and
that
i
think
everyone
has
been
very
shabby
i
was
afraid
of
it
you
know
i
felt
it
in
the
air
for
a
fortnight
before
it
came
when
i
saw
you
at
my
s
ball
taking
it
all
so
easily
i
felt
as
if
you
were
dancing
on
your
grave
but
what
could
i
do
i
wish
you
all
the
good
i
can
think
of
you
will
say
that
isn
t
much
yes
they
have
been
very
shabby
i
am
not
a
bit
afraid
to
say
it
i
assure
you
everyone
thinks
so
we
are
not
all
like
that
i
am
sorry
i
am
not
going
to
see
you
again
you
know
i
think
you
very
good
company
i
would
prove
it
by
asking
you
to
get
into
the
carriage
and
drive
with
me
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
while
i
wait
for
my
only
if
we
were
seen
considering
what
has
passed
and
everyone
knows
you
have
been
turned
away
it
might
be
thought
i
was
going
a
little
too
far
even
for
me
but
i
shall
see
you
sometimes
somewhere
eh
you
know
this
was
said
in
english
we
have
a
plan
for
a
little
newman
stood
there
with
his
hand
on
the
listening
to
this
consolatory
murmur
with
an
unlighted
eye
he
hardly
knew
what
madame
de
bellegarde
was
saying
he
was
only
conscious
that
she
was
chattering
ineffectively
but
suddenly
it
occurred
to
him
that
with
her
pretty
professions
there
was
a
way
of
making
her
effective
she
might
help
him
to
get
at
the
old
woman
and
the
marquis
they
are
coming
back
soon
your
companions
he
said
you
are
waiting
for
them
they
will
hear
the
mass
out
there
is
nothing
to
keep
them
longer
claire
has
refused
to
see
i
want
to
speak
to
them
said
newman
and
you
can
help
me
you
can
do
me
a
favor
delay
your
return
for
five
minutes
and
give
me
a
chance
at
them
i
will
wait
for
them
madame
de
bellegarde
clasped
her
hands
with
a
tender
grimace
my
poor
friend
what
do
you
want
to
do
to
them
to
beg
them
to
come
back
to
you
it
will
be
wasted
words
they
will
never
come
back
i
want
to
speak
to
them
all
the
same
pray
do
what
i
ask
you
stay
away
and
leave
them
to
me
for
five
minutes
you
needn
t
be
afraid
i
shall
not
be
violent
i
am
very
yes
you
look
very
quiet
if
they
had
cœur
you
would
move
them
but
they
haven
t
however
i
will
do
better
for
you
than
what
you
propose
the
understanding
is
not
that
i
shall
come
back
for
them
i
am
going
into
the
parc
monceau
with
my
little
girl
to
give
her
a
walk
and
my
who
comes
so
rarely
into
this
quarter
is
to
profit
by
the
same
opportunity
to
take
the
air
we
are
to
wait
for
her
in
the
park
where
my
husband
is
to
bring
her
to
us
follow
me
now
just
within
the
gates
i
shall
get
out
of
my
carriage
sit
down
on
a
chair
in
some
quiet
corner
and
i
will
bring
them
near
you
there
s
devotion
for
you
reste
vous
this
proposal
seemed
to
newman
extremely
felicitous
it
revived
his
drooping
spirit
and
he
reflected
that
madame
urbain
was
not
such
a
goose
as
she
seemed
he
promised
immediately
to
overtake
her
and
the
carriage
drove
away
the
parc
monceau
is
a
very
pretty
piece
of
but
newman
passing
into
it
bestowed
little
attention
upon
its
elegant
vegetation
which
was
full
of
the
freshness
of
spring
he
found
madame
de
bellegarde
promptly
seated
in
one
of
the
quiet
corners
of
which
she
had
spoken
while
before
her
in
the
alley
her
little
girl
attended
by
the
footman
and
the
walked
up
and
down
as
if
she
were
taking
a
lesson
in
deportment
newman
sat
down
beside
the
mamma
and
she
talked
a
great
deal
apparently
with
the
design
of
convincing
him
that
if
he
would
only
see
it
poor
dear
claire
did
not
belong
to
the
most
fascinating
type
of
woman
she
was
too
tall
and
thin
too
stiff
and
cold
her
mouth
was
too
wide
and
her
nose
too
narrow
she
had
no
dimples
anywhere
and
then
she
was
eccentric
eccentric
in
cold
blood
she
was
an
anglaise
after
all
newman
was
very
impatient
he
was
counting
the
minutes
until
his
victims
should
reappear
he
sat
silent
leaning
upon
his
cane
looking
absently
and
insensibly
at
the
little
marquise
at
length
madame
de
bellegarde
said
she
would
walk
toward
the
gate
of
the
park
and
meet
her
companions
but
before
she
went
she
dropped
her
eyes
and
after
playing
a
moment
with
the
lace
of
her
sleeve
looked
up
again
at
newman
do
you
remember
she
asked
the
promise
you
made
me
three
weeks
ago
and
then
as
newman
vainly
consulting
his
memory
was
obliged
to
confess
that
the
promise
had
escaped
it
she
declared
that
he
had
made
her
at
the
time
a
very
queer
answer
an
answer
at
which
viewing
it
in
the
light
of
the
sequel
she
had
fair
ground
for
taking
offense
you
promised
to
take
me
to
bullier
s
after
your
marriage
after
your
marriage
you
made
a
great
point
of
that
three
days
after
that
your
marriage
was
broken
off
do
you
know
when
i
heard
the
news
the
first
thing
i
said
to
myself
oh
heaven
now
he
won
t
go
with
me
to
bullier
s
and
i
really
began
to
wonder
if
you
had
not
been
expecting
the
oh
my
dear
lady
murmured
newman
looking
down
the
path
to
see
if
the
others
were
not
coming
i
shall
be
said
madame
de
bellegarde
one
must
not
ask
too
much
of
a
gentleman
who
is
in
love
with
a
cloistered
nun
besides
i
can
t
go
to
bullier
s
while
we
are
in
mourning
but
i
haven
t
given
it
up
for
that
the
is
arranged
i
have
my
cavalier
lord
deepmere
if
you
please
he
has
gone
back
to
his
dear
dublin
but
a
few
months
hence
i
am
to
name
any
evening
and
he
will
come
over
from
ireland
on
purpose
that
s
what
i
call
gallantry
shortly
after
this
madame
de
bellegarde
walked
away
with
her
little
girl
newman
sat
in
his
place
the
time
seemed
terribly
long
he
felt
how
fiercely
his
quarter
of
an
hour
in
the
convent
chapel
had
raked
over
the
glowing
coals
of
his
resentment
madame
de
bellegarde
kept
him
waiting
but
she
proved
as
good
as
her
word
at
last
she
reappeared
at
the
end
of
the
path
with
her
little
girl
and
her
footman
beside
her
slowly
walked
her
husband
with
his
mother
on
his
arm
they
were
a
long
time
advancing
during
which
newman
sat
unmoved
tingling
as
he
was
with
passion
it
was
extremely
characteristic
of
him
that
he
was
able
to
moderate
his
expression
of
it
as
he
would
have
turned
down
a
flaring
his
native
coolness
shrewdness
and
deliberateness
his
submissiveness
to
the
sentiment
that
words
were
acts
and
acts
were
steps
in
life
and
that
in
this
matter
of
taking
steps
curveting
and
prancing
were
exclusively
reserved
for
quadrupeds
and
foreigners
all
this
admonished
him
that
rightful
wrath
had
no
connection
with
being
a
fool
and
indulging
in
spectacular
violence
so
as
he
rose
when
old
madame
de
bellegarde
and
her
son
were
close
to
him
he
only
felt
very
tall
and
light
he
had
been
sitting
beside
some
shrubbery
in
such
a
way
as
not
to
be
noticeable
at
a
distance
but
de
bellegarde
had
evidently
already
perceived
him
his
mother
and
he
were
holding
their
course
but
newman
stepped
in
front
of
them
and
they
were
obliged
to
pause
he
lifted
his
hat
slightly
and
looked
at
them
for
a
moment
they
were
pale
with
amazement
and
disgust
excuse
me
for
stopping
you
he
said
in
a
low
tone
but
i
must
profit
by
the
occasion
i
have
ten
words
to
say
to
you
will
you
listen
to
them
the
marquis
glared
at
him
and
then
turned
to
his
mother
can
newman
possibly
have
anything
to
say
that
is
worth
our
listening
to
i
assure
you
i
have
something
said
newman
besides
it
is
my
duty
to
say
it
it
s
a
notification
a
your
duty
said
old
madame
de
bellegarde
her
thin
lips
curving
like
scorched
paper
that
is
your
affair
not
madame
urbain
meanwhile
had
seized
her
little
girl
by
the
hand
with
a
gesture
of
surprise
and
impatience
which
struck
newman
intent
as
he
was
upon
his
own
words
with
its
dramatic
effectiveness
if
newman
is
going
to
make
a
scene
in
public
she
exclaimed
i
will
take
my
poor
child
out
of
the
she
is
too
young
to
see
such
naughtiness
and
she
instantly
resumed
her
walk
you
had
much
better
listen
to
me
newman
went
on
whether
you
do
or
not
things
will
be
disagreeable
for
you
but
at
any
rate
you
will
be
we
have
already
heard
something
of
your
threats
said
the
marquis
and
you
know
what
we
think
of
you
think
a
good
deal
more
than
you
admit
a
moment
newman
added
in
reply
to
an
exclamation
of
the
old
lady
i
remember
perfectly
that
we
are
in
a
public
place
and
you
see
i
am
very
quiet
i
am
not
going
to
tell
your
secret
to
the
i
shall
keep
it
to
begin
with
for
certain
picked
listeners
anyone
who
observes
us
will
think
that
we
are
having
a
friendly
chat
and
that
i
am
complimenting
you
madam
on
your
venerable
the
marquis
gave
three
short
sharp
raps
on
the
ground
with
his
stick
i
demand
of
you
to
step
out
of
our
path
he
hissed
newman
instantly
complied
and
de
bellegarde
stepped
forward
with
his
mother
then
newman
said
half
an
hour
hence
madame
de
bellegarde
will
regret
that
she
didn
t
learn
exactly
what
i
the
marquise
had
taken
a
few
steps
but
at
these
words
she
paused
looking
at
newman
with
eyes
like
two
scintillating
globules
of
ice
you
are
like
a
peddler
with
something
to
sell
she
said
with
a
little
cold
laugh
which
only
partially
concealed
the
tremor
in
her
voice
oh
no
not
to
sell
newman
rejoined
i
give
it
to
you
for
and
he
approached
nearer
to
her
looking
her
straight
in
the
eyes
you
killed
your
husband
he
said
almost
in
a
whisper
that
is
you
tried
once
and
failed
and
then
without
trying
you
madame
de
bellegarde
closed
her
eyes
and
gave
a
little
cough
which
as
a
piece
of
dissimulation
struck
newman
as
really
heroic
dear
mother
said
the
marquis
does
this
stuff
amuse
you
so
much
the
rest
is
more
amusing
said
newman
you
had
better
not
lose
madame
de
bellegarde
opened
her
eyes
the
scintillations
had
gone
out
of
them
they
were
fixed
and
dead
but
she
smiled
superbly
with
her
narrow
little
lips
and
repeated
newman
s
word
amusing
have
i
killed
someone
else
i
don
t
count
your
daughter
said
newman
though
i
might
your
husband
knew
what
you
were
doing
i
have
a
proof
of
it
whose
existence
you
have
never
and
he
turned
to
the
marquis
who
was
terribly
white
whiter
than
newman
had
ever
seen
anyone
out
of
a
picture
a
paper
written
by
the
hand
and
signed
with
the
name
of
de
bellegarde
written
after
you
madam
had
left
him
for
dead
and
while
you
sir
had
gone
not
very
fast
for
the
the
marquis
looked
at
his
mother
she
turned
away
looking
vaguely
round
her
i
must
sit
down
she
said
in
a
low
tone
going
toward
the
bench
on
which
newman
had
been
sitting
couldn
t
you
have
spoken
to
me
alone
said
the
marquis
to
newman
with
a
strange
look
well
yes
if
i
could
have
been
sure
of
speaking
to
your
mother
alone
too
newman
answered
but
i
have
had
to
take
you
as
i
could
get
madame
de
bellegarde
with
a
movement
very
eloquent
of
what
he
would
have
called
her
grit
her
pluck
and
her
instinctive
appeal
to
her
own
personal
resources
drew
her
hand
out
of
her
son
s
arm
and
went
and
seated
herself
upon
the
bench
there
she
remained
with
her
hands
folded
in
her
lap
looking
straight
at
newman
the
expression
of
her
face
was
such
that
he
fancied
at
first
that
she
was
smiling
but
he
went
and
stood
in
front
of
her
and
saw
that
her
elegant
features
were
distorted
by
agitation
he
saw
however
equally
that
she
was
resisting
her
agitation
with
all
the
rigor
of
her
inflexible
will
and
there
was
nothing
like
either
fear
or
submission
in
her
stony
stare
she
had
been
startled
but
she
was
not
terrified
newman
had
an
exasperating
feeling
that
she
would
get
the
better
of
him
still
he
would
not
have
believed
it
possible
that
he
could
so
utterly
fail
to
be
touched
by
the
sight
of
a
woman
criminal
or
other
in
so
tight
a
place
madame
de
bellegarde
gave
a
glance
at
her
son
which
seemed
tantamount
to
an
injunction
to
be
silent
and
leave
her
to
her
own
devices
the
marquis
stood
beside
her
with
his
hands
behind
him
looking
at
newman
what
paper
is
this
you
speak
of
asked
the
old
lady
with
an
imitation
of
tranquillity
which
would
have
been
applauded
in
a
veteran
actress
exactly
what
i
have
told
you
said
newman
a
paper
written
by
your
husband
after
you
had
left
him
for
dead
and
during
the
couple
of
hours
before
you
returned
you
see
he
had
the
time
you
shouldn
t
have
stayed
away
so
long
it
declares
distinctly
his
wife
s
murderous
i
should
like
to
see
it
madame
de
bellegarde
observed
i
thought
you
might
said
newman
and
i
have
taken
a
and
he
drew
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
a
small
folded
sheet
give
it
to
my
son
said
madame
de
bellegarde
newman
handed
it
to
the
marquis
whose
mother
glancing
at
him
said
simply
look
at
de
bellegarde
s
eyes
had
a
pale
eagerness
which
it
was
useless
for
him
to
try
to
dissimulate
he
took
the
paper
in
his
fingers
and
opened
it
there
was
a
silence
during
which
he
read
it
he
had
more
than
time
to
read
it
but
still
he
said
nothing
he
stood
staring
at
it
where
is
the
original
asked
madame
de
bellegarde
in
a
voice
which
was
really
a
consummate
negation
of
impatience
in
a
very
safe
place
of
course
i
can
t
show
you
that
said
newman
you
might
want
to
take
hold
of
it
he
added
with
conscious
quaintness
but
that
s
a
very
correct
copy
except
of
course
the
handwriting
i
am
keeping
the
original
to
show
someone
de
bellegarde
at
last
looked
up
and
his
eyes
were
still
very
eager
to
whom
do
you
mean
to
show
it
well
i
m
thinking
of
beginning
with
the
duchess
said
newman
that
stout
lady
i
saw
at
your
ball
she
asked
me
to
come
and
see
her
you
know
i
thought
at
the
moment
i
shouldn
t
have
much
to
say
to
her
but
my
little
document
will
give
us
something
to
talk
you
had
better
keep
it
my
son
said
madame
de
bellegarde
by
all
means
said
newman
keep
it
and
show
it
to
your
mother
when
you
get
and
after
showing
it
to
the
duchess
asked
the
marquis
folding
the
paper
and
putting
it
away
well
i
ll
take
up
the
dukes
said
newman
then
the
counts
and
the
barons
all
the
people
you
had
the
cruelty
to
introduce
me
to
in
a
character
of
which
you
meant
immediately
to
deprive
me
i
have
made
out
a
for
a
moment
neither
madame
de
bellegarde
nor
her
son
said
a
word
the
old
lady
sat
with
her
eyes
upon
the
ground
de
bellegarde
s
blanched
pupils
were
fixed
upon
her
face
then
looking
at
newman
is
that
all
you
have
to
say
she
asked
no
i
want
to
say
a
few
words
more
i
want
to
say
that
i
hope
you
quite
understand
what
i
m
about
this
is
my
revenge
you
know
you
have
treated
me
before
the
world
convened
for
the
express
purpose
as
if
i
were
not
good
enough
for
you
i
mean
to
show
the
world
that
however
bad
i
may
be
you
are
not
quite
the
people
to
say
madame
de
bellegarde
was
silent
again
and
then
she
broke
her
silence
her
continued
to
be
extraordinary
i
needn
t
ask
you
who
has
been
your
accomplice
mrs
bread
told
me
that
you
had
purchased
her
don
t
accuse
mrs
bread
of
venality
said
newman
she
has
kept
your
secret
all
these
years
she
has
given
you
a
long
respite
it
was
beneath
her
eyes
your
husband
wrote
that
paper
he
put
it
into
her
hands
with
a
solemn
injunction
that
she
was
to
make
it
public
she
was
too
to
make
use
of
the
old
lady
appeared
for
an
instant
to
hesitate
and
then
she
was
my
husband
s
mistress
she
said
softly
this
was
the
only
concession
to
that
she
condescended
to
make
i
doubt
that
said
newman
madame
de
bellegarde
got
up
from
her
bench
it
was
not
to
your
opinions
i
undertook
to
listen
and
if
you
have
nothing
left
but
them
to
tell
me
i
think
this
remarkable
interview
may
and
turning
to
the
marquis
she
took
his
arm
again
my
son
she
said
say
something
de
bellegarde
looked
down
at
his
mother
passing
his
hand
over
his
forehead
and
then
tenderly
caressingly
what
shall
i
say
he
asked
there
is
only
one
thing
to
say
said
the
marquise
that
it
was
really
not
worth
while
to
have
interrupted
our
but
the
marquis
thought
he
could
improve
this
your
paper
s
a
forgery
he
said
to
newman
newman
shook
his
head
a
little
with
a
tranquil
smile
m
de
bellegarde
he
said
your
mother
does
better
she
has
done
better
all
along
from
the
first
of
my
knowing
you
you
re
a
mighty
plucky
woman
madam
he
continued
it
s
a
great
pity
you
have
made
me
your
enemy
i
should
have
been
one
of
your
greatest
pauvre
said
madame
de
bellegarde
to
her
son
in
french
and
as
if
she
had
not
heard
these
words
you
must
take
me
immediately
to
my
newman
stepped
back
and
let
them
leave
him
he
watched
them
a
moment
and
saw
madame
urbain
with
her
little
girl
come
out
of
a
to
meet
them
the
old
lady
stooped
and
kissed
her
grandchild
damn
it
she
plucky
said
newman
and
he
walked
home
with
a
slight
sense
of
being
balked
she
was
so
inexpressively
defiant
but
on
reflection
he
decided
that
what
he
had
witnessed
was
no
real
sense
of
security
still
less
a
real
innocence
it
was
only
a
very
superior
style
of
brazen
assurance
wait
till
she
reads
the
paper
he
said
to
himself
and
he
concluded
that
he
should
hear
from
her
soon
he
heard
sooner
than
he
expected
the
next
morning
before
midday
when
he
was
about
to
give
orders
for
his
breakfast
to
be
served
de
bellegarde
s
card
was
brought
to
him
she
has
read
the
paper
and
she
has
passed
a
bad
night
said
newman
he
instantly
admitted
his
visitor
who
came
in
with
the
air
of
the
ambassador
of
a
great
power
meeting
the
delegate
of
a
barbarous
tribe
whom
an
absurd
accident
had
enabled
for
the
moment
to
be
abominably
annoying
the
ambassador
at
all
events
had
passed
a
bad
night
and
his
faultlessly
careful
toilet
only
threw
into
relief
the
frigid
rancor
in
his
eyes
and
the
mottled
tones
of
his
refined
complexion
he
stood
before
newman
a
moment
breathing
quickly
and
softly
and
shaking
his
forefinger
curtly
as
his
host
pointed
to
a
chair
what
i
have
come
to
say
is
soon
said
he
declared
and
can
only
be
said
without
i
am
good
for
as
much
or
for
as
little
as
you
desire
said
newman
the
marquis
looked
round
the
room
a
moment
and
then
on
what
terms
will
you
part
with
your
scrap
of
paper
on
none
and
while
newman
with
his
head
on
one
side
and
his
hands
behind
him
sounded
the
marquis
s
turbid
gaze
with
his
own
he
added
certainly
that
is
not
worth
sitting
down
de
bellegarde
meditated
a
moment
as
if
he
had
not
heard
newman
s
refusal
my
mother
and
i
last
evening
he
said
talked
over
your
story
you
will
be
surprised
to
learn
that
we
think
your
little
document
is
a
and
he
held
back
his
word
a
moment
is
you
forget
that
with
you
i
am
used
to
surprises
exclaimed
newman
with
a
laugh
the
very
smallest
amount
of
respect
that
we
owe
to
my
father
s
memory
the
marquis
continued
makes
us
desire
that
he
should
not
be
held
up
to
the
world
as
the
author
of
so
so
infernal
an
attack
upon
the
reputation
of
a
wife
whose
only
fault
was
that
she
had
been
submissive
to
accumulated
oh
i
see
said
newman
it
s
for
your
father
s
and
he
laughed
the
laugh
in
which
he
indulged
when
he
was
most
amused
a
noiseless
laugh
with
his
lips
closed
but
de
bellegarde
s
gravity
held
good
there
are
a
few
of
my
father
s
particular
friends
for
whom
the
knowledge
of
so
so
unfortunate
an
inspiration
would
be
a
real
grief
even
say
we
firmly
established
by
medical
evidence
the
presumption
of
a
mind
disordered
by
fever
en
resterait
quelque
at
the
best
it
would
look
ill
in
him
very
ill
don
t
try
medical
evidence
said
newman
don
t
touch
the
doctors
and
they
won
t
touch
you
i
don
t
mind
your
knowing
that
i
have
not
written
to
newman
fancied
that
he
saw
signs
in
de
bellegarde
s
discolored
mask
that
this
information
was
extremely
pertinent
but
it
may
have
been
merely
fancy
for
the
marquis
remained
majestically
argumentative
for
instance
madame
d
outreville
he
said
of
whom
you
spoke
yesterday
i
can
imagine
nothing
that
would
shock
her
oh
i
am
quite
prepared
to
shock
madame
d
outreville
you
know
that
s
on
the
cards
i
expect
to
shock
a
great
many
de
bellegarde
examined
for
a
moment
the
stitching
on
the
back
of
one
of
his
gloves
then
without
looking
up
we
don
t
offer
you
money
he
said
that
we
supposed
to
be
newman
turning
away
took
a
few
turns
about
the
room
and
then
came
back
what
you
offer
me
by
what
i
can
make
out
the
generosity
is
all
to
be
on
my
the
marquis
dropped
his
arms
at
his
side
and
held
his
head
a
little
higher
what
we
offer
you
is
a
chance
a
chance
that
a
gentleman
should
appreciate
a
chance
to
abstain
from
inflicting
a
terrible
blot
upon
the
memory
of
a
man
who
certainly
had
his
faults
but
who
personally
had
done
you
no
there
are
two
things
to
say
to
that
said
newman
the
first
is
as
regards
appreciating
your
chance
that
you
don
t
consider
me
a
gentleman
that
s
your
great
point
you
know
it
s
a
poor
rule
that
won
t
work
both
ways
the
second
is
that
well
in
a
word
you
are
talking
great
nonsense
newman
who
in
the
midst
of
his
bitterness
had
as
i
have
said
kept
well
before
his
eyes
a
certain
ideal
of
saying
nothing
rude
was
immediately
somewhat
regretfully
conscious
of
the
sharpness
of
these
words
but
he
speedily
observed
that
the
marquis
took
them
more
quietly
than
might
have
been
expected
de
bellegarde
like
the
stately
ambassador
that
he
was
continued
the
policy
of
ignoring
what
was
disagreeable
in
his
adversary
s
replies
he
gazed
at
the
gilded
arabesques
on
the
opposite
wall
and
then
presently
transferred
his
glance
to
newman
as
if
he
too
were
a
large
grotesque
in
a
rather
vulgar
system
of
i
suppose
you
know
that
as
regards
yourself
it
won
t
do
at
how
do
you
mean
it
won
t
do
why
of
course
you
damn
yourself
but
i
suppose
that
s
in
your
programme
you
propose
to
throw
mud
at
us
you
believe
you
hope
that
some
of
it
may
stick
we
know
of
course
it
can
t
explained
the
marquis
in
a
tone
of
conscious
lucidity
but
you
take
the
chance
and
are
willing
at
any
rate
to
show
that
you
yourself
have
dirty
that
s
a
good
comparison
at
least
half
of
it
is
said
newman
i
take
the
chance
of
something
sticking
but
as
regards
my
hands
they
are
clean
i
have
taken
the
matter
up
with
my
de
bellegarde
looked
a
moment
into
his
hat
all
our
friends
are
quite
with
us
he
said
they
would
have
done
exactly
as
we
have
i
shall
believe
that
when
i
hear
them
say
it
meanwhile
i
shall
think
better
of
human
the
marquis
looked
into
his
hat
again
madame
de
cintré
was
extremely
fond
of
her
father
if
she
knew
of
the
existence
of
the
few
written
words
of
which
you
propose
to
make
this
scandalous
use
she
would
demand
of
you
proudly
for
his
sake
to
give
it
up
to
her
and
she
would
destroy
it
without
reading
very
possibly
newman
rejoined
but
she
will
not
know
i
was
in
that
convent
yesterday
and
i
know
what
is
doing
lord
deliver
us
you
can
guess
whether
it
made
me
feel
forgiving
de
bellegarde
appeared
to
have
nothing
more
to
suggest
but
he
continued
to
stand
there
rigid
and
elegant
as
a
man
who
believed
that
his
mere
personal
presence
had
an
argumentative
value
newman
watched
him
and
without
yielding
an
inch
on
the
main
issue
felt
an
incongruously
impulse
to
help
him
to
retreat
in
good
order
your
visit
s
a
failure
you
see
he
said
you
offer
too
propose
something
yourself
said
the
marquis
give
me
back
madame
de
cintré
in
the
same
state
in
which
you
took
her
from
de
bellegarde
threw
back
his
head
and
his
pale
face
flushed
never
he
said
you
can
t
we
wouldn
t
if
we
could
in
the
sentiment
which
led
us
to
deprecate
her
marriage
nothing
is
deprecate
is
good
cried
newman
it
was
hardly
worth
while
to
come
here
only
to
tell
me
that
you
are
not
ashamed
of
yourselves
i
could
have
guessed
that
the
marquis
slowly
walked
toward
the
door
and
newman
following
opened
it
for
him
what
you
propose
to
do
will
be
very
disagreeable
de
bellegarde
said
that
is
very
evident
but
it
will
be
nothing
as
i
understand
it
newman
answered
that
will
be
quite
enough
de
bellegarde
stood
for
a
moment
looking
on
the
ground
as
if
he
were
ransacking
his
ingenuity
to
see
what
else
he
could
do
to
save
his
father
s
reputation
then
with
a
little
cold
sigh
he
seemed
to
signify
that
he
regretfully
surrendered
the
late
marquis
to
the
penalty
of
his
turpitude
he
gave
a
hardly
perceptible
shrug
took
his
neat
umbrella
from
the
servant
in
the
vestibule
and
with
his
gentlemanly
walk
passed
out
newman
stood
listening
till
he
heard
the
door
close
then
he
slowly
exclaimed
well
i
ought
to
begin
to
be
satisfied
now
chapter
xxv
newman
called
upon
the
comical
duchess
and
found
her
at
home
an
old
gentleman
with
a
high
nose
and
a
cane
was
just
taking
leave
of
her
he
made
newman
a
protracted
obeisance
as
he
retired
and
our
hero
supposed
that
he
was
one
of
the
mysterious
grandees
with
whom
he
had
shaken
hands
at
madame
de
bellegarde
s
ball
the
duchess
in
her
armchair
from
which
she
did
not
move
with
a
great
on
one
side
of
her
a
pile
of
novels
on
the
other
and
a
large
piece
of
tapestry
depending
from
her
lap
presented
an
expansive
and
imposing
front
but
her
aspect
was
in
the
highest
degree
gracious
and
there
was
nothing
in
her
manner
to
check
the
effusion
of
his
confidence
she
talked
to
him
about
flowers
and
books
getting
launched
with
marvelous
promptitude
about
the
theatres
about
the
peculiar
institutions
of
his
native
country
about
the
humidity
of
paris
about
the
pretty
complexions
of
the
american
ladies
about
his
impressions
of
france
and
his
opinion
of
its
female
inhabitants
all
this
was
a
brilliant
monologue
on
the
part
of
the
duchess
who
like
many
of
her
was
a
person
of
an
affirmative
rather
than
an
interrogative
cast
of
mind
who
made
and
put
them
herself
into
circulation
and
who
was
apt
to
offer
you
a
present
of
a
convenient
little
opinion
neatly
enveloped
in
the
gilt
paper
of
a
happy
gallicism
newman
had
come
to
her
with
a
grievance
but
he
found
himself
in
an
atmosphere
in
which
apparently
no
cognizance
was
taken
of
grievance
an
atmosphere
into
which
the
chill
of
discomfort
had
never
penetrated
and
which
seemed
exclusively
made
up
of
mild
sweet
stale
intellectual
perfumes
the
feeling
with
which
he
had
watched
madame
d
outreville
at
the
treacherous
festival
of
the
bellegardes
came
back
to
him
she
struck
him
as
a
wonderful
old
lady
in
a
comedy
particularly
well
up
in
her
part
he
observed
before
long
that
she
asked
him
no
questions
about
their
common
friends
she
made
no
allusion
to
the
circumstances
under
which
he
had
been
presented
to
her
she
neither
feigned
ignorance
of
a
change
in
these
circumstances
nor
pretended
to
condole
with
him
upon
it
but
she
smiled
and
discoursed
and
compared
the
wools
of
her
tapestry
as
if
the
bellegardes
and
their
wickedness
were
not
of
this
world
she
is
fighting
shy
said
newman
to
himself
and
having
made
the
observation
he
was
prompted
to
observe
farther
how
the
duchess
would
carry
off
her
indifference
she
did
so
in
a
masterly
manner
there
was
not
a
gleam
of
disguised
consciousness
in
those
small
clear
demonstrative
eyes
which
constituted
her
nearest
claim
to
personal
loveliness
there
was
not
a
symptom
of
apprehension
that
newman
would
trench
upon
the
ground
she
proposed
to
avoid
upon
my
word
she
does
it
very
well
he
tacitly
commented
they
all
hold
together
bravely
and
whether
anyone
else
can
trust
them
or
not
they
can
certainly
trust
each
newman
at
this
juncture
fell
to
admiring
the
duchess
for
her
fine
manners
he
felt
most
accurately
that
she
was
not
a
grain
less
urbane
than
she
would
have
been
if
his
marriage
were
still
in
prospect
but
he
felt
also
that
she
was
not
a
particle
more
urbane
he
had
come
so
reasoned
the
duchess
heaven
knew
why
he
had
come
after
what
had
happened
and
for
the
half
hour
therefore
she
would
be
but
she
would
never
see
him
again
finding
no
opportunity
to
tell
his
story
newman
pondered
these
things
more
dispassionately
than
might
have
been
expected
he
stretched
his
legs
as
usual
and
even
chuckled
a
little
appreciatively
and
noiselessly
and
then
as
the
duchess
went
on
relating
a
with
which
her
mother
had
snubbed
the
great
napoleon
it
occurred
to
newman
that
her
evasion
of
a
chapter
of
french
history
more
interesting
to
himself
might
possibly
be
the
result
of
an
extreme
consideration
for
his
feelings
perhaps
it
was
delicacy
on
the
duchess
s
part
not
policy
he
was
on
the
point
of
saying
something
himself
to
make
the
chance
which
he
had
determined
to
give
her
still
better
when
the
servant
announced
another
visitor
the
duchess
on
hearing
the
name
it
was
that
of
an
italian
prince
gave
a
little
imperceptible
pout
and
said
to
newman
rapidly
i
beg
you
to
remain
i
desire
this
visit
to
be
newman
said
to
himself
at
this
that
madame
d
outreville
intended
after
all
that
they
should
discuss
the
bellegardes
together
the
prince
was
a
short
stout
man
with
a
head
disproportionately
large
he
had
a
dusky
complexion
and
a
bushy
eyebrow
beneath
which
his
eye
wore
a
fixed
and
somewhat
defiant
expression
he
seemed
to
be
challenging
you
to
insinuate
that
he
was
the
duchess
judging
from
her
charge
to
newman
regarded
him
as
a
bore
but
this
was
not
apparent
from
the
unchecked
flow
of
her
conversation
she
made
a
fresh
series
of
characterized
with
great
felicity
the
italian
intellect
and
the
taste
of
the
figs
at
sorrento
predicted
the
ultimate
future
of
the
italian
kingdom
disgust
with
the
brutal
sardinian
rule
and
complete
reversion
throughout
the
peninsula
to
the
sacred
sway
of
the
holy
father
and
finally
gave
a
history
of
the
love
affairs
of
the
princess
x
this
narrative
provoked
some
rectifications
on
the
part
of
the
prince
who
as
he
said
pretended
to
know
something
about
that
matter
and
having
satisfied
himself
that
newman
was
in
no
laughing
mood
either
with
regard
to
the
size
of
his
head
or
anything
else
he
entered
into
the
controversy
with
an
animation
for
which
the
duchess
when
she
set
him
down
as
a
bore
could
not
have
been
prepared
the
sentimental
vicissitudes
of
the
princess
x
led
to
a
discussion
of
the
heart
history
of
florentine
nobility
in
general
the
duchess
had
spent
five
weeks
in
florence
and
had
gathered
much
information
on
the
subject
this
was
merged
in
turn
in
an
examination
of
the
italian
heart
the
duchess
took
a
brilliantly
heterodox
view
thought
it
the
least
susceptible
organ
of
its
kind
that
she
had
ever
encountered
related
examples
of
its
want
of
susceptibility
and
at
last
declared
that
for
her
the
italians
were
a
people
of
ice
the
prince
became
flame
to
refute
her
and
his
visit
really
proved
charming
newman
was
naturally
out
of
the
conversation
he
sat
with
his
head
a
little
on
one
side
watching
the
interlocutors
the
duchess
as
she
talked
frequently
looked
at
him
with
a
smile
as
if
to
intimate
in
the
charming
manner
of
her
nation
that
it
lay
only
with
him
to
say
something
very
much
to
the
point
but
he
said
nothing
at
all
and
at
last
his
thoughts
began
to
wander
a
singular
feeling
came
over
him
a
sudden
sense
of
the
folly
of
his
errand
what
under
the
sun
had
he
to
say
to
the
duchess
after
all
wherein
would
it
profit
him
to
tell
her
that
the
bellegardes
were
traitors
and
that
the
old
lady
into
the
bargain
was
a
murderess
he
seemed
morally
to
have
turned
a
sort
of
somersault
and
to
find
things
looking
differently
in
consequence
he
felt
a
sudden
stiffening
of
his
will
and
quickening
of
his
reserve
what
in
the
world
had
he
been
thinking
of
when
he
fancied
the
duchess
could
help
him
and
that
it
would
conduce
to
his
comfort
to
make
her
think
ill
of
the
bellegardes
what
did
her
opinion
of
the
bellegardes
matter
to
him
it
was
only
a
shade
more
important
than
the
opinion
the
bellegardes
entertained
of
her
the
duchess
help
him
that
cold
stout
soft
artificial
woman
help
him
she
who
in
the
last
twenty
minutes
had
built
up
between
them
a
wall
of
polite
conversation
in
which
she
evidently
flattered
herself
that
he
would
never
find
a
gate
had
it
come
to
that
that
he
was
asking
favors
of
conceited
people
and
appealing
for
sympathy
where
he
had
no
sympathy
to
give
he
rested
his
arms
on
his
knees
and
sat
for
some
minutes
staring
into
his
hat
as
he
did
so
his
ears
tingled
he
had
come
very
near
being
an
ass
whether
or
no
the
duchess
would
hear
his
story
he
wouldn
t
tell
it
was
he
to
sit
there
another
half
hour
for
the
sake
of
exposing
the
bellegardes
the
bellegardes
be
hanged
he
got
up
abruptly
and
advanced
to
shake
hands
with
his
hostess
you
can
t
stay
longer
she
asked
very
graciously
i
am
afraid
not
he
said
she
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
i
had
an
idea
you
had
something
particular
to
say
to
me
she
declared
newman
looked
at
her
he
felt
a
little
dizzy
for
the
moment
he
seemed
to
be
turning
his
somersault
again
the
little
italian
prince
came
to
his
help
ah
madam
who
has
not
that
he
softly
sighed
don
t
teach
newman
to
say
said
the
duchess
it
is
his
merit
that
he
doesn
t
know
yes
i
don
t
know
how
to
say
said
newman
and
i
don
t
want
to
say
anything
i
am
sure
you
are
very
considerate
said
the
duchess
with
a
smile
and
she
gave
him
a
little
nod
for
with
which
he
took
his
departure
once
in
the
street
he
stood
for
some
time
on
the
pavement
wondering
whether
after
all
he
was
not
an
ass
not
to
have
discharged
his
pistol
and
then
again
he
decided
that
to
talk
to
anyone
whomsoever
about
the
bellegardes
would
be
extremely
disagreeable
to
him
the
least
disagreeable
thing
under
the
circumstances
was
to
banish
them
from
his
mind
and
never
think
of
them
again
indecision
had
not
hitherto
been
one
of
newman
s
weaknesses
and
in
this
case
it
was
not
of
long
duration
for
three
days
after
this
he
did
not
or
at
least
he
tried
not
to
think
of
the
bellegardes
he
dined
with
tristram
and
on
her
mentioning
their
name
he
begged
her
almost
severely
to
desist
this
gave
tom
tristram
a
opportunity
to
offer
his
condolences
he
leaned
forward
laying
his
hand
on
newman
s
arm
compressing
his
lips
and
shaking
his
head
the
fact
is
my
dear
fellow
you
see
that
you
ought
never
to
have
gone
into
it
it
was
not
your
doing
i
know
it
was
all
my
wife
if
you
want
to
come
down
on
her
i
ll
stand
off
i
give
you
leave
to
hit
her
as
hard
as
you
like
you
know
she
has
never
had
a
word
of
reproach
from
me
in
her
life
and
i
think
she
is
in
need
of
something
of
the
kind
why
didn
t
you
listen
to
you
know
i
didn
t
believe
in
the
thing
i
thought
it
at
the
best
an
amiable
delusion
i
don
t
profess
to
be
a
don
juan
or
a
gay
lothario
that
class
of
man
you
know
but
i
do
pretend
to
know
something
about
the
harder
sex
i
have
never
disliked
a
woman
in
my
life
that
she
has
not
turned
out
badly
i
was
not
at
all
deceived
in
lizzie
for
instance
i
always
had
my
doubts
about
her
whatever
you
may
think
of
my
present
situation
i
must
at
least
admit
that
i
got
into
it
with
my
eyes
open
now
suppose
you
had
got
into
something
like
this
box
with
madame
de
cintré
you
may
depend
upon
it
she
would
have
turned
out
a
stiff
one
and
upon
my
word
i
don
t
see
where
you
could
have
found
your
comfort
not
from
the
marquis
my
dear
newman
he
wasn
t
a
man
you
could
go
and
talk
things
over
with
in
a
sociable
way
did
he
ever
seem
to
want
to
have
you
on
the
premises
did
he
ever
try
to
see
you
alone
did
he
ever
ask
you
to
come
and
smoke
a
cigar
with
him
of
an
evening
or
step
in
when
you
had
been
calling
on
the
ladies
and
take
something
i
don
t
think
you
would
have
got
much
encouragement
out
of
and
as
for
the
old
lady
she
struck
one
as
an
uncommonly
strong
dose
they
have
a
great
expression
here
you
know
they
call
it
everything
is
sympathetic
or
ought
to
be
now
madame
de
bellegarde
is
about
as
sympathetic
as
that
they
re
a
d
d
lot
any
way
i
felt
it
awfully
at
that
ball
of
theirs
i
felt
as
if
i
were
walking
up
and
down
in
the
armory
in
the
tower
of
london
my
dear
boy
don
t
think
me
a
vulgar
brute
for
hinting
at
it
but
you
may
depend
upon
it
all
they
wanted
was
your
money
i
know
something
about
that
i
can
tell
when
people
want
one
s
money
why
they
stopped
wanting
yours
i
don
t
know
i
suppose
because
they
could
get
someone
else
s
without
working
so
hard
for
it
it
isn
t
worth
finding
out
it
may
be
that
it
was
not
madame
de
cintré
that
backed
out
first
very
likely
the
old
woman
put
her
up
to
it
i
suspect
she
and
her
mother
are
really
as
thick
as
thieves
eh
you
are
well
out
of
it
my
boy
make
up
your
mind
to
that
if
i
express
myself
strongly
it
is
all
because
i
love
you
so
much
and
from
that
point
of
view
i
may
say
i
should
as
soon
have
thought
of
making
up
to
that
piece
of
pale
as
i
should
have
thought
of
making
up
to
the
obelisk
in
the
place
de
la
newman
sat
gazing
at
tristram
during
this
harangue
with
a
eye
never
yet
had
he
seemed
to
himself
to
have
outgrown
so
completely
the
phase
of
equal
comradeship
with
tom
tristram
tristram
s
glance
at
her
husband
had
more
of
a
spark
she
turned
to
newman
with
a
slightly
lurid
smile
you
must
at
least
do
justice
she
said
to
the
felicity
with
which
tristram
repairs
the
indiscretions
of
a
too
zealous
but
even
without
the
aid
of
tom
tristram
s
conversational
felicities
newman
would
have
begun
to
think
of
the
bellegardes
again
he
could
cease
to
think
of
them
only
when
he
ceased
to
think
of
his
loss
and
privation
and
the
days
had
as
yet
but
scantily
lightened
the
weight
of
this
incommodity
in
vain
tristram
begged
him
to
cheer
up
she
assured
him
that
the
sight
of
his
countenance
made
her
miserable
how
can
i
help
it
he
demanded
with
a
trembling
voice
i
feel
like
a
widower
and
a
widower
who
has
not
even
the
consolation
of
going
to
stand
beside
the
grave
of
his
wife
who
has
not
the
right
to
wear
so
much
mourning
as
a
weed
on
his
hat
i
feel
he
added
in
a
moment
as
if
my
wife
had
been
murdered
and
her
assassins
were
still
at
tristram
made
no
immediate
rejoinder
but
at
last
she
said
with
a
smile
which
in
so
far
as
it
was
a
forced
one
was
less
successfully
simulated
than
such
smiles
on
her
lips
usually
were
are
you
very
sure
that
you
would
have
been
happy
newman
stared
a
moment
and
then
shook
his
head
that
s
weak
he
said
that
won
t
well
said
tristram
with
a
more
triumphant
bravery
i
don
t
believe
you
would
have
been
newman
gave
a
little
laugh
say
i
should
have
been
miserable
then
it
s
a
misery
i
should
have
preferred
to
any
tristram
began
to
muse
i
should
have
been
curious
to
see
it
would
have
been
very
was
it
from
curiosity
that
you
urged
me
to
try
and
marry
her
a
little
said
tristram
growing
still
more
audacious
newman
gave
her
the
one
angry
look
he
had
been
destined
ever
to
give
her
turned
away
and
took
up
his
hat
she
watched
him
a
moment
and
then
she
said
that
sounds
very
cruel
but
it
is
less
so
than
it
sounds
curiosity
has
a
share
in
almost
everything
i
do
i
wanted
very
much
to
see
first
whether
such
a
marriage
could
actually
take
place
second
what
would
happen
if
it
should
take
so
you
didn
t
believe
said
newman
resentfully
yes
i
believed
i
believed
that
it
would
take
place
and
that
you
would
be
happy
otherwise
i
should
have
been
among
my
speculations
a
very
heartless
creature
she
continued
laying
her
hand
upon
newman
s
arm
and
hazarding
a
grave
smile
it
was
the
highest
flight
ever
taken
by
a
tolerably
bold
imagination
shortly
after
this
she
recommended
him
to
leave
paris
and
travel
for
three
months
change
of
scene
would
do
him
good
and
he
would
forget
his
misfortune
sooner
in
absence
from
the
objects
which
had
witnessed
it
i
really
feel
newman
rejoined
as
if
to
leave
at
least
would
do
me
good
and
cost
me
very
little
effort
you
are
growing
cynical
you
shock
me
and
pain
very
good
said
tristram
or
cynically
as
may
be
thought
most
probable
i
shall
certainly
see
you
newman
was
very
willing
to
get
away
from
paris
the
brilliant
streets
he
had
walked
through
in
his
happier
hours
and
which
then
seemed
to
wear
a
higher
brilliancy
in
honor
of
his
happiness
appeared
now
to
be
in
the
secret
of
his
defeat
and
to
look
down
upon
it
in
shining
mockery
he
would
go
somewhere
he
cared
little
where
and
he
made
his
preparations
then
one
morning
at
haphazard
he
drove
to
the
train
that
would
transport
him
to
boulogne
and
dispatch
him
thence
to
the
shores
of
britain
as
he
rolled
along
in
the
train
he
asked
himself
what
had
become
of
his
revenge
and
he
was
able
to
say
that
it
was
provisionally
in
a
very
safe
place
it
would
keep
till
called
for
he
arrived
in
london
in
the
midst
of
what
is
called
the
season
and
it
seemed
to
him
at
first
that
he
might
here
put
himself
in
the
way
of
being
diverted
from
his
he
knew
no
one
in
all
england
but
the
spectacle
of
the
mighty
metropolis
roused
him
somewhat
from
his
apathy
anything
that
was
enormous
usually
found
favor
with
newman
and
the
multitudinous
energies
and
industries
of
england
stirred
within
him
a
dull
vivacity
of
contemplation
it
is
on
record
that
the
weather
at
that
moment
was
of
the
finest
english
quality
he
took
long
walks
and
explored
london
in
every
direction
he
sat
by
the
hour
in
kensington
gardens
and
beside
the
adjoining
drive
watching
the
people
and
the
horses
and
the
carriages
the
rosy
english
beauties
the
wonderful
english
dandies
and
the
splendid
flunkies
he
went
to
the
opera
and
found
it
better
than
in
paris
he
went
to
the
theatre
and
found
a
surprising
charm
in
listening
to
dialogue
the
finest
points
of
which
came
within
the
range
of
his
comprehension
he
made
several
excursions
into
the
country
recommended
by
the
waiter
at
his
hotel
with
whom
on
this
and
similar
points
he
had
established
confidential
relations
he
watched
the
deer
in
windsor
forest
and
admired
the
thames
from
richmond
hill
he
ate
and
and
butter
at
greenwich
and
strolled
in
the
grassy
shadow
of
the
cathedral
of
canterbury
he
also
visited
the
tower
of
london
and
madame
tussaud
s
exhibition
one
day
he
thought
he
would
go
to
sheffield
and
then
thinking
again
he
gave
it
up
why
should
he
go
to
sheffield
he
had
a
feeling
that
the
link
which
bound
him
to
a
possible
interest
in
the
manufacture
of
cutlery
was
broken
he
had
no
desire
for
an
inside
view
of
any
successful
enterprise
whatever
and
he
would
not
have
given
the
smallest
sum
for
the
privilege
of
talking
over
the
details
of
the
most
splendid
business
with
the
shrewdest
of
overseers
one
afternoon
he
had
walked
into
hyde
park
and
was
slowly
threading
his
way
through
the
human
maze
which
edges
the
drive
the
stream
of
carriages
was
no
less
dense
and
newman
as
usual
marveled
at
the
strange
dingy
figures
which
he
saw
taking
the
air
in
some
of
the
stateliest
vehicles
they
reminded
him
of
what
he
had
read
of
eastern
and
southern
countries
in
which
grotesque
idols
and
fetiches
were
sometimes
taken
out
of
their
temples
and
carried
abroad
in
golden
chariots
to
be
displayed
to
the
multitude
he
saw
a
great
many
pretty
cheeks
beneath
hats
as
he
squeezed
his
way
through
serried
waves
of
crumpled
muslin
and
sitting
on
little
chairs
at
the
base
of
the
great
serious
english
trees
he
observed
a
number
of
maidens
who
seemed
only
to
remind
him
afresh
that
the
magic
of
beauty
had
gone
out
of
the
world
with
madame
de
cintré
to
say
nothing
of
other
damsels
whose
eyes
were
not
quiet
and
who
struck
him
still
more
as
a
satire
on
possible
consolation
he
had
been
walking
for
some
time
when
directly
in
front
of
him
borne
back
by
the
summer
breeze
he
heard
a
few
words
uttered
in
that
bright
parisian
idiom
from
which
his
ears
had
begun
to
alienate
themselves
the
voice
in
which
the
words
were
spoken
made
them
seem
even
more
like
a
thing
with
which
he
had
once
been
familiar
and
as
he
bent
his
eyes
it
lent
an
identity
to
the
commonplace
elegance
of
the
back
hair
and
shoulders
of
a
young
lady
walking
in
the
same
direction
as
himself
mademoiselle
nioche
apparently
had
come
to
seek
a
more
rapid
advancement
in
london
and
another
glance
led
newman
to
suppose
that
she
had
found
it
a
gentleman
was
strolling
beside
her
lending
a
most
attentive
ear
to
her
conversation
and
too
entranced
to
open
his
lips
newman
did
not
hear
his
voice
but
perceived
that
he
presented
the
dorsal
expression
of
a
englishman
mademoiselle
nioche
was
attracting
attention
the
ladies
who
passed
her
turned
round
to
survey
the
parisian
perfection
of
her
toilet
a
great
cataract
of
flounces
rolled
down
from
the
young
lady
s
waist
to
newman
s
feet
he
had
to
step
aside
to
avoid
treading
upon
them
he
stepped
aside
indeed
with
a
decision
of
movement
which
the
occasion
scarcely
demanded
for
even
this
imperfect
glimpse
of
miss
noémie
had
excited
his
displeasure
she
seemed
an
odious
blot
upon
the
face
of
nature
he
wanted
to
put
her
out
of
his
sight
he
thought
of
valentin
de
bellegarde
still
green
in
the
earth
of
his
burial
his
young
life
clipped
by
this
flourishing
impudence
the
perfume
of
the
young
lady
s
finery
sickened
him
he
turned
his
head
and
tried
to
deflect
his
course
but
the
pressure
of
the
crowd
kept
him
near
her
a
few
minutes
longer
so
that
he
heard
what
she
was
saying
ah
i
am
sure
he
will
miss
me
she
murmured
it
was
very
cruel
in
me
to
leave
him
i
am
afraid
you
will
think
me
a
very
heartless
creature
he
might
perfectly
well
have
come
with
us
i
don
t
think
he
is
very
well
she
added
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
was
not
very
newman
wondered
whom
she
was
talking
about
but
just
then
an
opening
among
his
neighbors
enabled
him
to
turn
away
and
he
said
to
himself
that
she
was
probably
paying
a
tribute
to
british
propriety
and
playing
at
tender
solicitude
about
her
papa
was
that
miserable
old
man
still
treading
the
path
of
vice
in
her
train
was
he
still
giving
her
the
benefit
of
his
experience
of
affairs
and
had
he
crossed
the
sea
to
serve
as
her
interpreter
newman
walked
some
distance
farther
and
then
began
to
retrace
his
steps
taking
care
not
to
traverse
again
the
orbit
of
mademoiselle
nioche
at
last
he
looked
for
a
chair
under
the
trees
but
he
had
some
difficulty
in
finding
an
empty
one
he
was
about
to
give
up
the
search
when
he
saw
a
gentleman
rise
from
the
seat
he
had
been
occupying
leaving
newman
to
take
it
without
looking
at
his
neighbors
he
sat
there
for
some
time
without
heeding
them
his
attention
was
lost
in
the
irritation
and
bitterness
produced
by
his
recent
glimpse
of
miss
noémie
s
iniquitous
vitality
but
at
the
end
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
dropping
his
eyes
he
perceived
a
small
squatted
upon
the
path
near
his
feet
a
diminutive
but
very
perfect
specimen
of
its
interesting
species
the
pug
was
sniffing
at
the
fashionable
world
as
it
passed
him
with
his
little
black
muzzle
and
was
kept
from
extending
his
investigation
by
a
large
blue
ribbon
attached
to
his
collar
with
an
enormous
rosette
and
held
in
the
hand
of
a
person
seated
next
to
newman
to
this
person
newman
transferred
his
attention
and
immediately
perceived
that
he
was
the
object
of
all
that
of
his
neighbor
who
was
staring
up
at
him
from
a
pair
of
little
fixed
white
eyes
these
eyes
newman
instantly
recognized
he
had
been
sitting
for
the
last
quarter
of
an
hour
beside
nioche
he
had
vaguely
felt
that
someone
was
staring
at
him
nioche
continued
to
stare
he
appeared
afraid
to
move
even
to
the
extent
of
evading
newman
s
glance
dear
me
said
newman
are
you
here
too
and
he
looked
at
his
neighbor
s
helplessness
more
grimly
than
he
knew
nioche
had
a
new
hat
and
a
pair
of
kid
gloves
his
clothes
too
seemed
to
belong
to
a
more
recent
antiquity
than
of
yore
over
his
arm
was
suspended
a
lady
s
mantilla
a
light
and
brilliant
tissue
fringed
with
white
lace
which
had
apparently
been
committed
to
his
keeping
and
the
little
dog
s
blue
ribbon
was
wound
tightly
round
his
hand
there
was
no
expression
of
recognition
in
his
face
or
of
anything
indeed
save
a
sort
of
feeble
fascinated
dread
newman
looked
at
the
pug
and
the
lace
mantilla
and
then
he
met
the
old
man
s
eyes
again
you
know
me
i
see
he
pursued
you
might
have
spoken
to
me
nioche
still
said
nothing
but
it
seemed
to
newman
that
his
eyes
began
faintly
to
water
i
didn
t
expect
our
hero
went
on
to
meet
you
so
far
from
from
the
café
de
la
the
old
man
remained
silent
but
decidedly
newman
had
touched
the
source
of
tears
his
neighbor
sat
staring
and
newman
added
what
s
the
matter
nioche
you
used
to
talk
to
talk
very
prettily
don
t
you
remember
you
even
gave
lessons
in
conversation
at
this
nioche
decided
to
change
his
attitude
he
stooped
and
picked
up
the
pug
lifted
it
to
his
face
and
wiped
his
eyes
on
its
little
soft
back
i
m
afraid
to
speak
to
you
he
presently
said
looking
over
the
puppy
s
shoulder
i
hoped
you
wouldn
t
notice
me
i
should
have
moved
away
but
i
was
afraid
that
if
i
moved
you
would
notice
me
so
i
sat
very
i
suspect
you
have
a
bad
conscience
sir
said
newman
the
old
man
put
down
the
little
dog
and
held
it
carefully
in
his
lap
then
he
shook
his
head
with
his
eyes
still
fixed
upon
his
interlocutor
no
newman
i
have
a
good
conscience
he
murmured
then
why
should
you
want
to
slink
away
from
me
because
because
you
don
t
understand
my
oh
i
think
you
once
explained
it
to
me
said
newman
but
it
seems
improved
exclaimed
nioche
under
his
breath
do
you
call
this
improvement
and
he
glanced
at
the
treasures
in
his
arms
why
you
are
on
your
travels
newman
rejoined
a
visit
to
london
in
the
season
is
certainly
a
sign
of
nioche
in
answer
to
this
cruel
piece
of
irony
lifted
the
puppy
up
to
his
face
again
peering
at
newman
with
his
small
blank
there
was
something
almost
imbecile
in
the
movement
and
newman
hardly
knew
whether
he
was
taking
refuge
in
a
convenient
affectation
of
unreason
or
whether
he
had
in
fact
paid
for
his
dishonor
by
the
loss
of
his
wits
in
the
latter
case
just
now
he
felt
little
more
tenderly
to
the
foolish
old
man
than
in
the
former
responsible
or
not
he
was
equally
an
accomplice
of
his
detestably
mischievous
daughter
newman
was
going
to
leave
him
abruptly
when
a
ray
of
entreaty
appeared
to
disengage
itself
from
the
old
man
s
misty
gaze
are
you
going
away
he
asked
do
you
want
me
to
stay
said
newman
i
should
have
left
you
from
consideration
but
my
dignity
suffers
at
your
leaving
me
that
have
you
got
anything
particular
to
say
to
me
nioche
looked
around
him
to
see
that
no
one
was
listening
and
then
he
said
very
softly
but
distinctly
i
have
forgiven
her
newman
gave
a
short
laugh
but
the
old
man
seemed
for
the
moment
not
to
perceive
it
he
was
gazing
away
absently
at
some
metaphysical
image
of
his
implacability
it
doesn
t
much
matter
whether
you
forgive
her
or
not
said
newman
there
are
other
people
who
won
t
i
assure
what
has
she
done
nioche
softly
questioned
turning
round
again
i
don
t
know
what
she
does
you
she
has
done
a
devilish
mischief
it
doesn
t
matter
what
said
newman
she
s
a
nuisance
she
ought
to
be
nioche
stealthily
put
out
his
hand
and
laid
it
very
gently
upon
newman
s
arm
stopped
yes
he
whispered
that
s
it
stopped
short
she
is
running
away
she
must
be
then
he
paused
a
moment
and
looked
round
him
i
mean
to
stop
her
he
went
on
i
am
only
waiting
for
my
i
see
said
newman
laughing
briefly
again
she
is
running
away
and
you
are
running
after
her
you
have
run
a
long
distance
but
nioche
stared
insistently
i
shall
stop
her
he
softly
repeated
he
had
hardly
spoken
when
the
crowd
in
front
of
them
separated
as
if
by
the
impulse
to
make
way
for
an
important
personage
presently
through
the
opening
advanced
mademoiselle
nioche
attended
by
the
gentleman
whom
newman
had
lately
observed
his
face
being
now
presented
to
our
hero
the
latter
recognized
the
irregular
features
the
hardly
more
regular
complexion
and
the
amiable
expression
of
lord
deepmere
noémie
on
finding
herself
suddenly
confronted
with
newman
who
like
nioche
had
risen
from
his
seat
faltered
for
a
barely
perceptible
instant
she
gave
him
a
little
nod
as
if
she
had
seen
him
yesterday
and
then
with
a
smile
how
we
keep
meeting
she
said
she
looked
consummately
pretty
and
the
front
of
her
dress
was
a
wonderful
work
of
art
she
went
up
to
her
father
stretching
out
her
hands
for
the
little
dog
which
he
submissively
placed
in
them
and
she
began
to
kiss
it
and
murmur
over
it
to
think
of
leaving
him
all
alone
what
a
wicked
abominable
creature
he
must
believe
me
he
has
been
very
unwell
she
added
turning
and
affecting
to
explain
to
newman
with
a
spark
of
infernal
impudence
fine
as
a
needlepoint
in
her
eye
i
don
t
think
the
english
climate
agrees
with
it
seems
to
agree
wonderfully
well
with
his
mistress
said
newman
do
you
mean
me
i
have
never
been
better
thank
you
miss
noémie
declared
but
with
and
she
gave
a
brilliant
glance
at
her
late
companion
how
can
one
help
being
well
she
seated
herself
in
the
chair
from
which
her
father
had
risen
and
began
to
arrange
the
little
dog
s
rosette
lord
deepmere
carried
off
such
embarrassment
as
might
be
incidental
to
this
unexpected
encounter
with
the
inferior
grace
of
a
male
and
a
briton
he
blushed
a
good
deal
and
greeted
the
object
of
his
late
momentary
aspiration
to
rivalry
in
the
favor
of
a
person
other
than
the
mistress
of
the
invalid
pug
with
an
awkward
nod
and
a
rapid
ejaculation
an
ejaculation
to
which
newman
who
often
found
it
hard
to
understand
the
speech
of
english
people
was
able
to
attach
no
meaning
then
the
young
man
stood
there
with
his
hand
on
his
hip
and
with
a
conscious
grin
staring
askance
at
miss
noémie
suddenly
an
idea
seemed
to
strike
him
and
he
said
turning
to
newman
oh
you
know
her
yes
said
newman
i
know
her
i
don
t
believe
you
oh
dear
yes
i
do
said
lord
deepmere
with
another
grin
i
knew
her
in
paris
by
my
poor
cousin
bellegarde
you
know
he
knew
her
poor
fellow
didn
t
he
it
was
she
you
know
who
was
at
the
bottom
of
his
affair
awfully
sad
wasn
t
it
continued
the
young
man
talking
off
his
embarrassment
as
his
simple
nature
permitted
they
got
up
some
story
about
its
being
for
the
pope
about
the
other
man
having
said
something
against
the
pope
s
morals
they
always
do
that
you
know
they
put
it
on
the
pope
because
bellegarde
was
once
in
the
zouaves
but
it
was
about
morals
was
the
pope
lord
deepmere
pursued
directing
an
eye
illumined
by
this
pleasantry
toward
mademoiselle
nioche
who
was
bending
gracefully
over
her
apparently
absorbed
in
conversation
with
it
i
dare
say
you
think
it
rather
odd
that
i
should
ah
keep
up
the
acquaintance
the
young
man
resumed
but
she
couldn
t
help
it
you
know
and
bellegarde
was
only
my
twentieth
cousin
i
dare
say
you
think
it
s
rather
cheeky
my
showing
with
her
in
hyde
park
but
you
see
she
isn
t
known
yet
and
she
s
in
such
very
good
form
and
lord
deepmere
s
conclusion
was
lost
in
the
attesting
glance
which
he
again
directed
toward
the
young
lady
newman
turned
away
he
was
having
more
of
her
than
he
relished
nioche
had
stepped
aside
on
his
daughter
s
approach
and
he
stood
there
within
a
very
small
compass
looking
down
hard
at
the
ground
it
had
never
yet
as
between
him
and
newman
been
so
apposite
to
place
on
record
the
fact
that
he
had
not
forgiven
his
daughter
as
newman
was
moving
away
he
looked
up
and
drew
near
to
him
and
newman
seeing
the
old
man
had
something
particular
to
say
bent
his
head
for
an
instant
you
will
see
it
some
day
in
the
papers
murmured
nioche
our
hero
departed
to
hide
his
smile
and
to
this
day
though
the
newspapers
form
his
principal
reading
his
eyes
have
not
been
arrested
by
any
paragraph
forming
a
sequel
to
this
announcement
chapter
xxvi
in
that
uninitiated
observation
of
the
great
spectacle
of
english
life
upon
which
i
have
touched
it
might
be
supposed
that
newman
passed
a
great
many
dull
days
but
the
dullness
of
his
days
pleased
him
his
melancholy
which
was
settling
into
a
secondary
stage
like
a
healing
wound
had
in
it
a
certain
acrid
palatable
sweetness
he
had
company
in
his
thoughts
and
for
the
present
he
wanted
no
other
he
had
no
desire
to
make
acquaintances
and
he
left
untouched
a
couple
of
notes
of
introduction
which
had
been
sent
him
by
tom
tristram
he
thought
a
great
deal
of
madame
de
cintré
sometimes
with
a
dogged
tranquillity
which
might
have
seemed
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
at
a
time
a
near
neighbor
to
forgetfulness
he
lived
over
again
the
happiest
hours
he
had
known
that
silver
chain
of
numbered
days
in
which
his
afternoon
visits
tending
sensibly
to
the
ideal
result
had
subtilized
his
good
humor
to
a
sort
of
spiritual
intoxication
he
came
back
to
reality
after
such
reveries
with
a
somewhat
muffled
shock
he
had
begun
to
feel
the
need
of
accepting
the
unchangeable
at
other
times
the
reality
became
an
infamy
again
and
the
unchangeable
an
imposture
and
he
gave
himself
up
to
his
angry
restlessness
till
he
was
weary
but
on
the
whole
he
fell
into
a
rather
reflective
mood
without
in
the
least
intending
it
or
knowing
it
he
attempted
to
read
the
moral
of
his
strange
misadventure
he
asked
himself
in
his
quieter
hours
whether
perhaps
after
all
he
more
commercial
than
was
pleasant
we
know
that
it
was
in
obedience
to
a
strong
reaction
against
questions
exclusively
commercial
that
he
had
come
out
to
pick
up
æsthetic
entertainment
in
europe
it
may
therefore
be
understood
that
he
was
able
to
conceive
that
a
man
might
be
too
commercial
he
was
very
willing
to
grant
it
but
the
concession
as
to
his
own
case
was
not
made
with
any
very
oppressive
sense
of
shame
if
he
had
been
too
commercial
he
was
ready
to
forget
it
for
in
being
so
he
had
done
no
man
any
wrong
that
might
not
be
as
easily
forgotten
he
reflected
with
sober
placidity
that
at
least
there
were
no
monuments
of
his
meanness
scattered
about
the
world
if
there
was
any
reason
in
the
nature
of
things
why
his
connection
with
business
should
have
cast
a
shadow
upon
a
connection
even
a
connection
broken
with
a
woman
justly
proud
he
was
willing
to
sponge
it
out
of
his
life
forever
the
thing
seemed
a
possibility
he
could
not
feel
it
doubtless
as
keenly
as
some
people
and
it
hardly
seemed
worth
while
to
flap
his
wings
very
hard
to
rise
to
the
idea
but
he
could
feel
it
enough
to
make
any
sacrifice
that
still
remained
to
be
made
as
to
what
such
sacrifice
was
now
to
be
made
to
here
newman
stopped
short
before
a
blank
wall
over
which
there
sometimes
played
a
shadowy
imagery
he
had
a
fancy
of
carrying
out
his
life
as
he
would
have
directed
it
if
madame
de
cintré
had
been
left
to
him
of
making
it
a
religion
to
do
nothing
that
she
would
have
disliked
in
this
certainly
there
was
no
sacrifice
but
there
was
a
pale
oblique
ray
of
inspiration
it
would
be
lonely
entertainment
a
good
deal
like
a
man
talking
to
himself
in
the
mirror
for
want
of
better
company
yet
the
idea
yielded
newman
several
half
hours
dumb
exaltation
as
he
sat
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
legs
stretched
over
the
relics
of
an
expensively
poor
dinner
in
the
undying
english
twilight
if
however
his
commercial
imagination
was
dead
he
felt
no
contempt
for
the
surviving
actualities
begotten
by
it
he
was
glad
he
had
been
prosperous
and
had
been
a
great
man
of
business
rather
than
a
small
one
he
was
extremely
glad
he
was
rich
he
felt
no
impulse
to
sell
all
he
had
and
give
to
the
poor
or
to
retire
into
meditative
economy
and
asceticism
he
was
glad
he
was
rich
and
tolerably
young
if
it
was
possible
to
think
too
much
about
buying
and
selling
it
was
a
gain
to
have
a
good
slice
of
life
left
in
which
not
to
think
about
them
come
what
should
he
think
about
now
again
and
again
newman
could
think
only
of
one
thing
his
thoughts
always
came
back
to
it
and
as
they
did
so
with
an
emotional
rush
which
seemed
physically
to
express
itself
in
a
sudden
upward
choking
he
leaned
forward
the
waiter
having
left
the
room
and
resting
his
arms
on
the
table
buried
his
troubled
face
he
remained
in
england
till
midsummer
and
spent
a
month
in
the
country
wandering
about
cathedrals
castles
and
ruins
several
times
taking
a
walk
from
his
inn
into
meadows
and
parks
he
stopped
by
a
stile
looked
across
through
the
early
evening
at
a
gray
church
tower
with
its
dusky
nimbus
of
swallows
and
remembered
that
this
might
have
been
part
of
the
entertainment
of
his
honeymoon
he
had
never
been
so
much
alone
or
indulged
so
little
in
accidental
dialogue
the
period
of
recreation
appointed
by
tristram
had
at
last
expired
and
he
asked
himself
what
he
should
do
now
tristram
had
written
to
him
proposing
to
him
that
he
should
join
her
in
the
pyrenees
but
he
was
not
in
the
humor
to
return
to
france
the
simplest
thing
was
to
repair
to
liverpool
and
embark
on
the
first
american
steamer
newman
made
his
way
to
the
great
seaport
and
secured
his
berth
and
the
night
before
sailing
he
sat
in
his
room
at
the
hotel
staring
down
vacantly
and
wearily
at
an
open
portmanteau
a
number
of
papers
were
lying
upon
it
which
he
had
been
meaning
to
look
over
some
of
them
might
conveniently
be
destroyed
but
at
last
he
shuffled
them
roughly
together
and
pushed
them
into
a
corner
of
the
valise
they
were
business
papers
and
he
was
in
no
humor
for
sifting
them
then
he
drew
forth
his
and
took
out
a
paper
of
smaller
size
than
those
he
had
dismissed
he
did
not
unfold
it
he
simply
sat
looking
at
the
back
of
it
if
he
had
momentarily
entertained
the
idea
of
destroying
it
the
idea
quickly
expired
what
the
paper
suggested
was
the
feeling
that
lay
in
his
innermost
heart
and
that
no
reviving
cheerfulness
could
long
quench
the
feeling
that
after
all
and
above
all
he
was
a
good
fellow
wronged
with
it
came
a
hearty
hope
that
the
bellegardes
were
enjoying
their
suspense
as
to
what
he
would
do
yet
the
more
it
was
prolonged
the
more
they
would
enjoy
it
he
had
hung
fire
once
yes
perhaps
in
his
present
queer
state
of
mind
he
might
hang
fire
again
but
he
restored
the
little
paper
to
his
very
tenderly
and
felt
better
for
thinking
of
the
suspense
of
the
bellegardes
he
felt
better
every
time
he
thought
of
it
after
that
as
he
sailed
the
summer
seas
he
landed
in
new
york
and
journeyed
across
the
continent
to
san
francisco
and
nothing
that
he
observed
by
the
way
contributed
to
mitigate
his
sense
of
being
a
good
fellow
wronged
he
saw
a
great
many
other
good
fellows
his
old
friends
but
he
told
none
of
them
of
the
trick
that
had
been
played
him
he
said
simply
that
the
lady
he
was
to
have
married
had
changed
her
mind
and
when
he
was
asked
if
he
had
changed
his
own
he
said
suppose
we
change
the
he
told
his
friends
that
he
had
brought
home
no
new
ideas
from
europe
and
his
conduct
probably
struck
them
as
an
eloquent
proof
of
failing
invention
he
took
no
interest
in
chatting
about
his
affairs
and
manifested
no
desire
to
look
over
his
accounts
he
asked
half
a
dozen
questions
which
like
those
of
an
eminent
physician
inquiring
for
particular
symptoms
showed
that
he
still
knew
what
he
was
talking
about
but
he
made
no
comments
and
gave
no
directions
he
not
only
puzzled
the
gentlemen
on
the
stock
exchange
but
he
was
himself
surprised
at
the
extent
of
his
indifference
as
it
seemed
only
to
increase
he
made
an
effort
to
combat
it
he
tried
to
interest
himself
and
to
take
up
his
old
occupations
but
they
appeared
unreal
to
him
do
what
he
would
he
somehow
could
not
believe
in
them
sometimes
he
began
to
fear
that
there
was
something
the
matter
with
his
head
that
his
brain
perhaps
had
softened
and
that
the
end
of
his
strong
activities
had
come
this
idea
came
back
to
him
with
an
exasperating
force
a
hopeless
helpless
loafer
useful
to
no
one
and
detestable
to
himself
this
was
what
the
treachery
of
the
bellegardes
had
made
of
him
in
his
restless
idleness
he
came
back
from
san
francisco
to
new
york
and
sat
for
three
days
in
the
lobby
of
his
hotel
looking
out
through
a
huge
wall
of
at
the
unceasing
stream
of
pretty
girls
in
dresses
undulating
past
with
little
parcels
nursed
against
their
neat
figures
at
the
end
of
three
days
he
returned
to
san
francisco
and
having
arrived
there
he
wished
he
had
stayed
away
he
had
nothing
to
do
his
occupation
was
gone
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
should
never
find
it
again
he
had
nothing
to
do
he
sometimes
said
to
himself
but
there
was
something
beyond
the
ocean
that
he
was
still
to
do
something
that
he
had
left
undone
experimentally
and
speculatively
to
see
if
it
could
content
itself
to
remain
undone
but
it
was
not
content
it
kept
pulling
at
his
heartstrings
and
thumping
at
his
reason
it
murmured
in
his
ears
and
hovered
perpetually
before
his
eyes
it
interposed
between
all
new
resolutions
and
their
fulfillment
it
seemed
like
a
stubborn
ghost
dumbly
entreating
to
be
laid
till
that
was
done
he
should
never
be
able
to
do
anything
else
one
day
toward
the
end
of
the
winter
after
a
long
interval
he
received
a
letter
from
tristram
who
apparently
was
animated
by
a
charitable
desire
to
amuse
and
distract
her
correspondent
she
gave
him
much
paris
gossip
talked
of
general
packard
and
miss
kitty
upjohn
enumerated
the
new
plays
at
the
theatre
and
enclosed
a
note
from
her
husband
who
had
gone
down
to
spend
a
month
at
nice
then
came
her
signature
and
after
this
her
postscript
the
latter
consisted
of
these
few
lines
i
heard
three
days
since
from
my
friend
the
abbé
aubert
that
madame
de
cintré
last
week
took
the
veil
at
the
carmelites
it
was
on
her
birthday
and
she
took
the
name
of
her
patroness
veronica
sister
veronica
has
a
lifetime
before
her
this
letter
came
to
newman
in
the
morning
in
the
evening
he
started
for
paris
his
wound
began
to
ache
with
its
first
fierceness
and
during
his
long
bleak
journey
the
thought
of
madame
de
cintré
s
passed
within
prison
walls
on
whose
outer
side
he
might
stand
kept
him
perpetual
company
now
he
would
fix
himself
in
paris
forever
he
would
extort
a
sort
of
happiness
from
the
knowledge
that
if
she
was
not
there
at
least
the
stony
sepulchre
that
held
her
was
he
descended
unannounced
upon
mrs
bread
whom
he
found
keeping
lonely
watch
in
his
great
empty
saloons
on
the
boulevard
haussmann
they
were
as
neat
as
a
dutch
village
bread
s
only
occupation
had
been
removing
individual
she
made
no
complaint
however
of
her
loneliness
for
in
her
philosophy
a
servant
was
but
a
mysteriously
projected
machine
and
it
would
be
as
fantastic
for
a
housekeeper
to
comment
upon
a
gentleman
s
absences
as
for
a
clock
to
remark
upon
not
being
wound
up
no
particular
clock
mrs
bread
supposed
went
all
the
time
and
no
particular
servant
could
enjoy
all
the
sunshine
diffused
by
the
career
of
an
exacting
master
she
ventured
nevertheless
to
express
a
modest
hope
that
newman
meant
to
remain
a
while
in
paris
newman
laid
his
hand
on
hers
and
shook
it
gently
i
mean
to
remain
forever
he
said
he
went
after
this
to
see
tristram
to
whom
he
had
telegraphed
and
who
expected
him
she
looked
at
him
a
moment
and
shook
her
head
this
won
t
do
she
said
you
have
come
back
too
he
sat
down
and
asked
about
her
husband
and
her
children
tried
even
to
inquire
about
miss
dora
finch
in
the
midst
of
this
do
you
know
where
she
is
he
asked
abruptly
tristram
hesitated
a
moment
of
course
he
couldn
t
mean
miss
dora
finch
then
she
answered
properly
she
has
gone
to
the
other
house
in
the
rue
d
after
newman
had
sat
a
while
longer
looking
very
sombre
she
went
on
you
are
not
so
good
a
man
as
i
thought
you
are
more
you
are
more
more
what
newman
asked
more
good
god
cried
newman
do
you
expect
me
to
forgive
no
not
that
i
have
forgiven
so
of
course
you
can
t
but
you
might
forget
you
have
a
worse
temper
about
it
than
i
should
have
expected
you
look
wicked
you
look
i
may
be
dangerous
he
said
but
i
am
not
wicked
no
i
am
not
and
he
got
up
to
go
tristram
asked
him
to
come
back
to
dinner
but
he
answered
that
he
did
not
feel
like
pledging
himself
to
be
present
at
an
entertainment
even
as
a
solitary
guest
later
in
the
evening
if
he
should
be
able
he
would
come
he
walked
away
through
the
city
beside
the
seine
and
over
it
and
took
the
direction
of
the
rue
d
enfer
the
day
had
the
softness
of
early
spring
but
the
weather
was
gray
and
humid
newman
found
himself
in
a
part
of
paris
which
he
little
knew
a
region
of
convents
and
prisons
of
streets
bordered
by
long
dead
walls
and
traversed
by
a
few
wayfarers
at
the
intersection
of
two
of
these
streets
stood
the
house
of
the
carmelites
a
dull
plain
edifice
with
a
blank
wall
all
round
it
from
without
newman
could
see
its
upper
windows
its
steep
roof
and
its
chimneys
but
these
things
revealed
no
symptoms
of
human
life
the
place
looked
dumb
deaf
inanimate
the
pale
dead
discolored
wall
stretched
beneath
it
far
down
the
empty
side
street
a
vista
without
a
human
figure
newman
stood
there
a
long
time
there
were
no
passers
he
was
free
to
gaze
his
fill
this
seemed
the
goal
of
his
journey
it
was
what
he
had
come
for
it
was
a
strange
satisfaction
and
yet
it
was
a
satisfaction
the
barren
stillness
of
the
place
seemed
to
be
his
own
release
from
ineffectual
longing
it
told
him
that
the
woman
within
was
lost
beyond
recall
and
that
the
days
and
years
of
the
future
would
pile
themselves
above
her
like
the
huge
immovable
slab
of
a
tomb
these
days
and
years
in
this
place
would
always
be
just
so
gray
and
silent
suddenly
from
the
thought
of
their
seeing
him
stand
there
again
the
charm
utterly
departed
he
would
never
stand
there
again
it
was
gratuitous
dreariness
he
turned
away
with
a
heavy
heart
but
with
a
heart
lighter
than
the
one
he
had
brought
everything
was
over
and
he
too
at
last
could
rest
he
walked
down
through
narrow
winding
streets
to
the
edge
of
the
seine
again
and
there
he
saw
close
above
him
the
soft
vast
towers
of
notre
dame
he
crossed
one
of
the
bridges
and
stood
a
moment
in
the
empty
place
before
the
great
cathedral
then
he
went
in
beneath
the
portals
he
wandered
some
distance
up
the
nave
and
sat
down
in
the
splendid
dimness
he
sat
a
long
time
he
heard
bells
chiming
off
at
long
intervals
to
the
rest
of
the
world
he
was
very
tired
this
was
the
best
place
he
could
be
in
he
said
no
prayers
he
had
no
prayers
to
say
he
had
nothing
to
be
thankful
for
and
he
had
nothing
to
ask
nothing
to
ask
because
now
he
must
take
care
of
himself
but
a
great
cathedral
offers
a
very
various
hospitality
and
newman
sat
in
his
place
because
while
he
was
there
he
was
out
of
the
world
the
most
unpleasant
thing
that
had
ever
happened
to
him
had
reached
its
formal
conclusion
as
it
were
he
could
close
the
book
and
put
it
away
he
leaned
his
head
for
a
long
time
on
the
chair
in
front
of
him
when
he
took
it
up
he
felt
that
he
was
himself
again
somewhere
in
his
mind
a
tight
knot
seemed
to
have
loosened
he
thought
of
the
bellegardes
he
had
almost
forgotten
them
he
remembered
them
as
people
he
had
meant
to
do
something
to
he
gave
a
groan
as
he
remembered
what
he
had
meant
to
do
he
was
annoyed
at
having
meant
to
do
it
the
bottom
suddenly
had
fallen
out
of
his
revenge
whether
it
was
christian
charity
or
unregenerate
good
nature
what
it
was
in
the
background
of
his
soul
i
don
t
pretend
to
say
but
newman
s
last
thought
was
that
of
course
he
would
let
the
bellegardes
go
if
he
had
spoken
it
aloud
he
would
have
said
that
he
didn
t
want
to
hurt
them
he
was
ashamed
of
having
wanted
to
hurt
them
they
had
hurt
him
but
such
things
were
really
not
his
game
at
last
he
got
up
and
came
out
of
the
darkening
church
not
with
the
elastic
step
of
a
man
who
had
won
a
victory
or
taken
a
resolve
but
strolling
soberly
like
a
man
who
is
still
a
little
ashamed
going
home
he
said
to
mrs
bread
that
he
must
trouble
her
to
put
back
his
things
into
the
portmanteau
she
had
unpacked
the
evening
before
his
gentle
stewardess
looked
at
him
through
eyes
a
trifle
bedimmed
dear
me
sir
she
exclaimed
i
thought
you
said
that
you
were
going
to
stay
i
meant
that
i
was
going
to
stay
away
forever
said
newman
kindly
and
since
his
departure
from
paris
on
the
following
day
he
has
certainly
not
returned
the
gilded
apartments
i
have
so
often
spoken
of
stand
ready
to
receive
him
but
they
serve
only
as
a
spacious
residence
for
mrs
bread
who
wanders
eternally
from
room
to
room
adjusting
the
tassels
of
the
curtains
and
keeps
her
wages
which
are
regularly
brought
her
by
a
banker
s
clerk
in
a
great
pink
sèvres
vase
on
the
mantelshelf
late
in
the
evening
newman
went
to
tristram
s
and
found
tom
tristram
by
the
domestic
fireside
i
m
glad
to
see
you
back
in
paris
this
gentleman
declared
you
know
it
s
really
the
only
place
for
a
white
man
to
tristram
made
his
friend
welcome
according
to
his
own
rosy
light
and
offered
him
a
convenient
of
the
gossip
of
the
last
six
months
then
at
last
he
got
up
and
said
he
would
go
for
half
an
hour
to
the
club
i
suppose
a
man
who
has
been
for
six
months
in
california
wants
a
little
intellectual
conversation
i
ll
let
my
wife
have
a
go
at
newman
shook
hands
heartily
with
his
host
but
did
not
ask
him
to
remain
and
then
he
relapsed
into
his
place
on
the
sofa
opposite
to
tristram
she
presently
asked
him
what
he
had
done
after
leaving
her
nothing
particular
said
newman
you
struck
me
she
rejoined
as
a
man
with
a
plot
in
his
head
you
looked
as
if
you
were
bent
on
some
sinister
errand
and
after
you
had
left
me
i
wondered
whether
i
ought
to
have
let
you
i
only
went
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
river
to
the
carmelites
said
newman
tristram
looked
at
him
a
moment
and
smiled
what
did
you
do
there
try
to
scale
the
wall
i
did
nothing
i
looked
at
the
place
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
came
tristram
gave
him
a
sympathetic
glance
you
didn
t
happen
to
meet
de
bellegarde
she
asked
staring
hopelessly
at
the
convent
wall
as
well
i
am
told
he
takes
his
sister
s
conduct
very
no
i
didn
t
meet
him
i
am
happy
to
say
newman
answered
after
a
pause
they
are
in
the
country
tristram
went
on
at
what
is
the
name
of
the
place
fleurières
they
returned
there
at
the
time
you
left
paris
and
have
been
spending
the
year
in
extreme
seclusion
the
little
marquise
must
enjoy
it
i
expect
to
hear
that
she
has
eloped
with
her
daughter
s
newman
was
looking
at
the
light
but
he
listened
to
this
with
extreme
interest
at
last
he
spoke
i
mean
never
to
mention
the
name
of
those
people
again
and
i
don
t
want
to
hear
anything
more
about
and
then
he
took
out
his
and
drew
forth
a
scrap
of
paper
he
looked
at
it
an
instant
then
got
up
and
stood
by
the
fire
i
am
going
to
burn
them
up
he
said
i
am
glad
to
have
you
as
a
witness
there
they
go
and
he
tossed
the
paper
into
the
flame
tristram
sat
with
her
embroidery
needle
suspended
what
is
that
paper
she
asked
newman
leaning
against
the
fireplace
stretched
his
arms
and
drew
a
longer
breath
than
usual
then
after
a
moment
i
can
tell
you
now
he
said
it
was
a
paper
containing
a
secret
of
the
bellegardes
something
which
would
damn
them
if
it
were
tristram
dropped
her
embroidery
with
a
reproachful
moan
ah
why
didn
t
you
show
it
to
me
i
thought
of
showing
it
to
you
i
thought
of
showing
it
to
everyone
i
thought
of
paying
my
debt
to
the
bellegardes
that
way
so
i
told
them
and
i
frightened
them
they
have
been
staying
in
the
country
as
you
tell
me
to
keep
out
of
the
explosion
but
i
have
given
it
tristram
began
to
take
slow
stitches
again
have
you
quite
given
it
up
oh
is
it
very
bad
this
secret
yes
very
for
myself
said
tristram
i
am
sorry
you
have
given
it
up
i
should
have
liked
immensely
to
see
your
paper
they
have
wronged
me
too
you
know
as
your
sponsor
and
guarantee
and
it
would
have
served
for
my
revenge
as
well
how
did
you
come
into
possession
of
your
secret
it
s
a
long
story
but
honestly
at
any
and
they
knew
you
were
master
of
it
oh
i
told
dear
me
how
interesting
cried
tristram
and
you
humbled
them
at
your
feet
newman
was
silent
a
moment
no
not
at
all
they
pretended
not
to
care
not
to
be
afraid
but
i
know
they
did
care
they
were
are
you
very
sure
newman
stared
a
moment
yes
i
m
tristram
resumed
her
slow
stitches
they
defied
you
eh
yes
said
newman
it
was
about
you
tried
by
the
threat
of
exposure
to
make
them
retract
tristram
pursued
yes
but
they
wouldn
t
i
gave
them
their
choice
and
they
chose
to
take
their
chance
of
bluffing
off
the
charge
and
convicting
me
of
fraud
but
they
frightened
newman
added
and
i
have
had
all
the
vengeance
i
it
is
most
provoking
said
tristram
to
hear
you
talk
of
the
charge
when
the
charge
is
burnt
up
is
it
quite
consumed
she
asked
glancing
at
the
fire
newman
assured
her
that
there
was
nothing
left
of
it
well
then
she
said
i
suppose
there
is
no
harm
in
saying
that
you
probably
did
not
make
them
so
very
uncomfortable
my
impression
would
be
that
since
as
you
say
they
defied
you
it
was
because
they
believed
that
after
all
you
would
never
really
come
to
the
point
their
confidence
after
counsel
taken
of
each
other
was
not
in
their
innocence
nor
in
their
talent
for
bluffing
things
off
it
was
in
your
remarkable
good
nature
you
see
they
were
newman
instinctively
turned
to
see
if
the
little
paper
was
in
fact
consumed
but
there
was
nothing
left
of
it
