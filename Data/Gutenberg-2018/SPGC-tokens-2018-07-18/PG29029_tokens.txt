sudden
death
she
sought
in
vain
the
young
woman
who
was
finishing
her
toilette
lost
patience
with
a
look
of
annoyance
she
half
turned
round
crying
well
captain
it
is
easy
to
see
that
you
are
not
accustomed
to
women
ways
this
pretty
girl
lover
a
man
about
forty
with
an
energetic
countenance
and
a
broad
forehead
adorned
with
sparse
locks
was
smoking
a
turkish
cigarette
taking
his
ease
on
a
divan
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
he
jumped
up
as
if
moved
by
a
spring
for
some
time
the
captain
had
followed
with
his
eyes
the
gestures
of
his
graceful
mistress
like
a
good
and
attentive
lover
he
guessed
what
she
required
he
rushed
into
the
adjoining
and
returned
with
a
little
onyx
cup
in
which
was
a
complete
assortment
of
pins
there
my
pretty
bobinette
he
cried
coming
up
to
the
young
woman
this
will
put
me
into
your
good
graces
again
she
thanked
him
with
a
smile
took
the
needed
pins
from
the
cup
and
quietly
finished
dressing
bobinette
was
a
beauty
the
thick
braids
of
her
abundant
tresses
with
their
natural
waves
and
curls
fell
to
where
the
lines
of
neck
and
shoulders
meet
their
tawny
hues
enhancing
the
milky
whiteness
of
her
plump
flesh
this
young
creature
was
of
the
true
rubens
type
it
was
half
past
three
in
the
afternoon
of
a
dull
november
day
a
kind
of
twilight
was
darkening
the
ground
floor
flat
in
the
quiet
rue
de
lille
where
the
two
lovers
were
together
for
some
months
now
captain
brocq
had
been
on
intimate
terms
with
this
intoxicating
young
person
who
answered
to
the
nickname
bobinette
her
features
though
irregular
were
pleasing
sprung
from
the
people
bobinette
had
tried
to
remedy
this
by
becoming
a
past
mistress
of
postures
of
attitudes
like
others
of
her
kind
from
her
very
childhood
she
had
learned
to
adapt
herself
to
whatever
company
she
was
in
picking
up
almost
intuitively
those
shades
of
taste
of
tact
which
can
transform
the
most
unconsidered
daughter
of
the
people
into
the
most
fastidious
of
parisiennes
it
was
the
contrary
as
regards
captain
brocq
an
artillery
and
attached
to
the
ministry
of
war
notwithstanding
his
intellectual
capacities
and
his
professional
worth
so
highly
valued
by
his
chiefs
he
always
remained
the
man
of
humble
origin
somewhat
gauche
timid
who
was
evidently
better
fitted
to
be
at
the
head
of
a
battery
on
the
bastions
of
a
fortress
than
frequenting
the
gossipy
clubs
of
officials
or
society
brocq
who
had
passed
out
of
the
military
academy
exceedingly
well
had
been
given
an
important
post
recently
a
confidential
appointment
at
the
ministry
of
war
during
the
first
years
of
his
military
life
brocq
had
been
entirely
preoccupied
by
his
profession
of
a
truth
as
pretty
bobinette
had
just
told
him
he
was
not
at
all
a
man
accustomed
to
women
this
was
why
when
verging
on
forty
his
heart
as
young
as
fresh
as
a
student
had
suddenly
caught
fire
when
he
happened
to
meet
bobinette
who
was
this
woman
brocq
could
not
place
her
with
that
mathematical
exactitude
dear
to
his
scientific
mind
she
puzzled
this
honest
man
who
fell
deeper
and
deeper
in
love
with
her
whenever
they
met
and
their
first
tender
effusions
were
over
the
lovers
exchanged
ideas
and
always
on
the
same
subject
bobinette
had
completed
her
toilet
in
leisurely
fashion
she
came
over
to
her
lover
and
seated
herself
beside
him
brocq
who
was
thinking
deeply
remained
silent
what
are
you
thinking
about
bobinette
suddenly
asked
in
a
chaffing
tone
have
you
solved
a
new
problem
or
are
you
thinking
of
a
dark
woman
brocq
smiled
amorously
he
put
his
arm
round
the
girl
supple
figure
drawing
her
to
him
and
burying
his
lips
in
her
abundant
and
perfumed
hair
he
murmured
tenderly
i
am
thinking
of
the
future
of
our
future
good
gracious
me
replied
bobinette
withdrawing
herself
from
his
arms
you
are
not
going
to
bore
me
again
with
your
ideas
of
marriage
the
captain
made
a
movement
of
protestation
but
bobinette
went
on
no
no
old
dear
no
chains
for
me
no
gag
no
muzzle
for
me
we
are
both
independent
let
us
remain
so
free
long
live
liberty
brocq
now
got
in
a
word
in
the
first
place
he
said
you
know
quite
well
you
would
do
a
very
stupid
thing
if
you
married
me
i
have
not
the
usual
dowry
far
from
it
then
i
am
not
of
your
world
can
you
see
me
in
a
playing
my
tricks
with
the
colonel
wife
the
general
wife
with
the
whole
blessed
lot
of
them
zut
i
am
just
what
i
am
just
brocq
now
got
in
a
word
in
the
first
place
he
observed
as
regards
the
dowry
you
know
very
well
my
pretty
bobinette
that
i
have
already
taken
steps
about
it
on
your
behalf
now
do
protest
it
gives
me
pleasure
to
make
your
future
safe
as
far
as
i
can
a
modest
competence
on
the
other
hand
i
am
not
a
society
man
and
if
you
wish
the
captain
drew
nearer
his
mistress
and
brushed
her
lips
with
his
moustache
bobinette
drew
back
got
up
from
the
divan
stood
in
front
of
her
lover
erect
arms
crossed
her
look
sullen
no
i
tell
you
i
wish
to
be
free
my
own
brocq
grew
impatient
but
in
spite
of
your
ideas
of
independence
my
poor
darling
you
are
always
in
a
state
of
servitude
why
only
to
give
one
example
for
the
last
two
years
you
have
been
content
to
occupy
an
inferior
position
in
the
house
of
this
bavarian
diplomat
or
austrian
i
do
know
what
he
is
naarboveck
asked
bobinette
surprised
but
do
imagine
that
i
am
the
baron
de
naarboveck
servant
still
if
it
were
otherwise
i
ca
play
proud
i
ca
bring
out
the
and
pedigree
of
my
ancestors
for
inspection
it
not
a
question
of
that
observed
brocq
bobinette
had
launched
forth
she
continued
but
that
is
the
question
you
are
always
imagining
that
i
have
things
given
me
to
do
which
lower
me
i
have
told
you
a
hundred
times
how
it
was
i
went
to
the
naarboveck
one
day
the
poor
man
came
to
the
hospital
he
was
almost
beside
himself
his
daughter
wilhelmine
who
is
barely
nineteen
had
just
been
taken
ill
it
was
typhoid
fever
he
was
obliged
to
go
away
and
leave
her
not
a
soul
in
whose
care
he
could
leave
the
child
with
confidence
i
was
recommended
to
naarboveck
i
came
i
nursed
wilhelmine
this
went
on
for
a
month
then
for
two
then
three
now
we
are
the
best
friends
in
the
world
wilhelmine
is
a
girl
whom
i
love
with
all
my
heart
the
baron
is
an
amiable
man
all
kindness
and
attention
it
is
true
that
i
am
now
a
kind
of
companion
in
an
position
as
you
choose
to
put
it
in
your
absurdly
vain
and
jealous
way
of
looking
at
things
but
my
dear
man
there
are
ways
and
ways
and
i
assure
you
i
am
treated
as
one
of
the
family
and
besides
you
ought
to
consider
that
it
was
precisely
at
the
naarboveck
receptions
we
met
with
the
utterance
of
these
last
words
bobinette
glanced
at
captain
brocq
as
if
she
would
annihilate
him
the
remembrance
of
their
first
meeting
seemed
more
odious
to
her
than
pleasing
brocq
whose
eyes
were
obstinately
lowered
saw
nothing
of
this
he
suggested
i
am
not
the
only
one
you
have
met
at
de
naarboveck
there
is
that
handsome
cuirassier
henri
de
bobinette
crimsoned
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
how
stupid
you
are
lieutenant
henri
does
not
give
me
a
thought
if
he
comes
to
the
brocq
interrupted
yes
i
know
he
comes
on
account
of
the
fair
wilhelmine
his
tone
was
conciliatory
once
more
he
drew
bobinette
to
him
but
she
seemed
to
object
more
and
more
strongly
to
the
caresses
glancing
at
a
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
she
cried
why
it
is
four
high
time
i
should
leave
brocq
who
had
followed
her
glance
added
suddenly
serious
my
faith
i
must
call
at
the
ministry
both
rose
bobinette
took
up
her
hat
and
went
to
the
brocq
exchanged
his
jacket
for
a
black
coat
he
went
into
his
study
separated
from
the
other
room
by
a
heavy
curtain
bobinette
he
called
that
young
person
responded
to
his
call
but
with
no
show
of
haste
she
found
the
captain
seated
before
his
bureau
rummaging
in
an
immense
drawer
crammed
full
of
papers
you
know
my
little
bobinette
that
i
have
made
you
my
sole
legatee
cried
the
captain
with
an
adoring
look
at
the
pretty
girl
who
suddenly
appeared
in
the
doorway
he
continued
his
search
among
his
papers
they
were
in
great
disorder
i
wished
to
show
you
it
a
question
of
spelling
your
name
correctly
you
are
called
berthe
are
you
not
the
girl
had
come
forward
she
quickly
caught
sight
of
a
mauve
sheet
of
paper
on
the
a
few
lines
were
traced
on
it
ah
you
wretch
she
cried
while
she
glanced
through
the
words
she
pretended
to
be
angry
i
caught
you
you
were
writing
to
a
woman
ho
it
starts
well
own
darling
adored
one
how
long
the
hours
seem
when
i
captain
brocq
shouted
with
laughter
ah
here
a
joke
why
it
is
you
who
are
jealous
now
bobinette
questioned
him
with
a
look
he
explained
but
you
great
idiot
do
you
understand
that
i
was
writing
to
you
and
that
only
a
couple
of
hours
ago
you
know
i
am
always
afraid
you
will
not
come
to
our
and
you
are
always
late
bobinette
reassured
now
helped
brocq
to
go
through
his
drawer
methodically
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
it
the
captain
was
a
most
untidy
man
family
letters
papers
covered
with
figures
handwritten
military
documents
even
some
were
jumbled
together
in
great
disorder
bobinette
noticed
her
own
handwriting
on
some
sheets
of
paper
how
well
she
knew
them
she
feigned
anger
it
is
abominable
to
compromise
me
like
this
she
cried
see
my
letters
love
letters
intimate
letters
lying
about
like
this
no
decidedly
brocq
put
her
right
no
no
my
pet
your
precious
letters
are
most
carefully
preserved
by
me
put
together
see
there
they
are
there
are
not
many
of
them
but
not
one
is
missing
you
are
sure
of
that
i
swear
it
bobinette
reflected
the
captain
however
returned
to
the
adjoining
room
hoping
to
come
across
the
deed
of
gift
he
had
set
his
mind
on
finding
come
with
me
bobe
he
called
he
opened
a
little
writing
desk
he
thought
his
mistress
had
followed
him
but
she
had
remained
in
the
study
bobinette
he
called
again
astonished
to
find
himself
alone
she
lingered
brocq
went
back
he
collided
with
the
girl
who
with
a
furtive
gesture
slipped
something
into
her
muff
well
said
he
well
what
now
she
retorted
they
gazed
at
each
other
for
a
moment
in
silence
what
were
you
doing
questioned
brocq
suspiciously
nothing
answered
bobinette
coldly
but
the
captain
caught
hold
of
her
hands
he
was
uneasy
almost
angry
tell
me
the
beauty
jumped
back
with
a
defiant
air
very
well
then
i
have
taken
my
letters
they
belong
to
me
i
wish
to
have
them
it
disgusts
me
to
think
that
they
are
left
lying
about
your
rooms
do
you
think
it
funny
that
your
orderly
should
read
them
to
his
that
your
concierge
should
know
all
about
them
i
declare
men
like
you
have
not
a
scrap
of
tact
of
nice
feeling
bobinette
the
captain
implored
her
no
no
and
again
no
cried
the
girl
more
and
more
angrily
i
have
them
i
keep
them
the
captain
grew
pale
she
added
a
little
more
gently
but
you
great
stupid
they
are
of
no
importance
i
give
them
back
to
you
later
when
you
are
good
you
are
behaving
like
a
schoolboy
come
kiss
me
tell
your
little
bobe
that
you
are
not
angry
with
her
if
you
do
i
shall
cry
already
she
was
beginning
to
sob
and
great
tears
were
dropping
captain
brocq
struck
dumb
gazed
at
her
sorrowfully
and
whilst
he
clasped
her
in
his
arms
anxiety
strained
at
his
heart
anguish
convulsed
his
soul
did
she
really
love
him
this
woman
with
her
whimsical
ways
her
independent
attitude
this
elusive
woman
who
never
gave
herself
entirely
was
he
the
dupe
of
a
comedy
did
she
consent
to
these
meetings
three
times
a
week
through
pity
through
sympathy
only
or
through
habit
or
worse
still
for
some
mercenary
reason
and
this
when
he
himself
would
have
given
up
everything
so
that
he
might
not
miss
them
ah
if
that
were
the
truth
the
captain
felt
an
immense
void
opening
in
the
depths
of
his
lonely
soul
he
apologised
in
a
low
voice
hurriedly
with
bent
head
humbly
and
bobinette
listened
with
curled
lip
and
haughty
air
she
bore
no
malice
she
declared
then
a
few
moments
later
for
she
was
really
much
upset
and
did
not
wish
to
show
it
she
hurried
away
dropping
a
hasty
kiss
on
her
forehead
as
a
token
of
peace
how
ardently
he
wished
that
this
peace
might
last
i
am
very
much
behind
time
she
had
murmured
by
way
of
farewell
directly
his
mistress
had
gone
brocq
went
to
the
window
watched
her
turn
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
lille
enter
the
rue
des
and
go
towards
the
quays
while
he
watched
her
he
was
trembling
a
roll
of
paper
was
sticking
out
of
bobinette
muff
brocq
knew
this
paper
its
appearance
and
colour
were
familiar
to
him
nevertheless
his
mind
was
so
full
of
his
love
affair
that
he
immediately
forgot
this
detail
but
in
a
minute
the
turn
of
events
forced
him
to
recall
it
in
heaven
name
shouted
captain
brocq
as
a
violent
blow
from
his
clenched
fist
made
the
scattered
papers
on
his
bureau
tremble
by
heaven
it
is
impossible
when
he
found
himself
alone
sadly
alone
in
his
little
flat
brocq
saw
it
was
five
and
more
than
time
to
start
for
the
ministry
of
war
hastily
putting
on
overcoat
and
hat
he
had
hurried
into
his
study
to
look
for
the
big
leather
portfolio
he
always
carried
when
taking
his
work
from
the
office
to
his
own
home
owing
to
his
special
knowledge
of
fortress
artillery
brocq
had
been
requested
to
put
the
finishing
touches
to
a
confidential
report
on
the
defences
of
the
eastern
forts
of
paris
and
the
distribution
of
the
effective
forces
of
the
companies
of
mechanics
in
time
of
mobilisation
he
had
searched
feverishly
in
his
drawers
for
this
report
which
was
of
no
great
bulk
for
the
last
ten
minutes
he
had
anxiously
searched
but
in
vain
he
could
not
find
a
trace
of
it
it
is
impossible
he
cried
he
swore
aloud
as
if
the
better
to
convince
himself
the
title
is
in
big
letters
in
red
and
twice
underlined
oh
it
is
quite
impossible
that
it
should
pass
under
my
eyes
unperceived
again
the
distracted
man
ransacked
his
papers
and
shook
his
portfolio
almost
beside
himself
with
exasperation
he
cried
my
excellent
bobinette
by
her
rummaging
has
put
the
finishing
touch
to
this
confusion
heaven
knows
it
was
bad
enough
before
he
paused
anguish
seized
him
he
fell
into
an
while
drops
of
sweat
broke
out
on
his
forehead
suddenly
he
had
remembered
the
roll
of
papers
sticking
out
of
bobinette
muff
he
uttered
a
cry
my
god
but
supposing
he
did
not
put
the
rest
of
his
thought
into
words
for
an
instant
he
had
the
idea
that
through
thoughtlessness
by
mistake
an
involuntary
one
assuredly
his
mistress
had
taken
this
document
to
wrap
up
her
letters
without
suspecting
that
was
it
no
doubt
she
had
carried
off
with
her
this
secret
plan
of
mobilisation
but
if
the
plan
got
lost
if
it
were
dropped
in
the
street
brocq
cursed
his
untidy
ways
once
more
he
would
never
forgive
himself
for
having
allowed
that
girl
to
ransack
his
drawers
but
he
must
act
and
at
once
he
must
without
fail
find
that
mislaid
document
of
one
thing
he
was
sure
the
document
was
not
on
the
premises
brocq
jumped
up
captain
captain
the
man
in
charge
at
the
cabstand
on
the
quay
des
at
the
corner
of
the
bridge
saluted
brocq
cordially
brocq
ghastly
pale
his
face
showing
signs
of
intense
anxiety
gasping
for
breath
asked
tell
me
just
now
ten
five
minutes
ago
did
you
not
see
a
lady
young
she
had
red
hair
did
she
not
pass
this
way
come
now
the
cabstand
than
winked
my
faith
captain
you
are
just
in
time
only
a
moment
ago
a
lady
such
as
you
describe
but
prettier
than
that
got
into
a
taxi
ah
interrupted
the
captain
do
you
know
what
address
she
gave
why
yes
i
do
i
was
almost
touching
her
when
she
spoke
to
the
well
faith
what
she
said
was
me
to
the
bois
and
the
cab
turned
by
the
bridge
probably
it
went
by
the
tuileries
quay
after
the
number
the
number
of
this
taxi
why
we
will
ask
the
policeman
at
the
kiosque
he
has
certainly
entered
it
as
usual
stamping
with
impatience
inside
a
landaulet
whose
hood
he
had
had
lowered
that
he
might
more
easily
see
around
him
brocq
had
rushed
off
in
pursuit
of
bobinette
taxi
shaking
from
head
to
foot
brocq
held
in
a
tight
grip
his
leather
portfolio
which
contained
all
the
documents
he
wished
to
lay
before
the
ministry
of
war
less
alas
the
mislaid
plan
of
the
eastern
forts
he
scrutinised
the
place
de
la
concorde
the
avenue
des
he
was
asking
himself
why
bobinette
after
telling
him
she
must
hurry
away
had
driven
to
the
bois
as
if
she
were
one
of
the
leisured
crowd
this
troubled
the
lover
in
him
as
well
as
the
soldier
why
had
he
rushed
after
his
mistress
in
this
fashion
what
definite
reason
had
he
after
all
it
was
exceedingly
improbable
surely
that
she
had
carried
away
this
document
without
noticing
it
for
it
was
composed
of
three
or
four
large
sheets
of
paper
in
that
case
she
must
have
lost
it
before
getting
into
the
taxi
as
to
supposing
for
an
instant
that
she
had
taken
it
away
intentionally
brocq
would
not
suppose
it
why
should
he
there
was
nothing
to
lead
him
to
think
but
all
the
same
all
the
same
the
captain
had
a
presentiment
a
conviction
an
instinctive
certainty
that
at
all
costs
he
must
overtake
bobinette
he
absolutely
must
why
brocq
could
not
have
said
why
he
did
not
reason
about
it
he
felt
a
feeling
as
indefinable
as
it
was
irresistible
drove
him
to
pursue
to
continue
the
chase
at
top
speed
again
and
again
he
had
shouted
to
the
astonished
chauffeur
who
was
driving
his
taxi
as
fast
as
the
crowded
street
permitted
get
on
in
the
devil
name
go
faster
faster
night
was
falling
the
close
of
this
november
day
was
particularly
beautiful
behind
the
arc
de
triomphe
a
broad
band
of
red
on
the
horizon
reflected
the
setting
sun
in
its
winter
glory
the
breeze
was
wafting
the
last
leaves
from
the
trees
turning
them
over
and
over
before
they
fell
on
the
autumnal
greensward
and
the
black
earth
of
the
empty
rows
of
carriages
were
moving
towards
the
étoile
as
they
had
cleared
the
of
the
brocq
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
some
fifty
yards
away
his
keen
eye
had
caught
sight
of
bobinette
taxi
he
had
identified
the
number
there
it
is
he
urged
the
chauffeur
to
follow
it
up
closely
regardless
of
consequences
a
moment
more
and
we
shall
have
caught
up
the
said
brocq
to
himself
his
landaulet
was
gaining
ground
the
crowd
of
vehicles
the
police
holding
them
up
where
the
roads
intersected
impeded
the
advance
brocq
wild
with
impatience
could
not
keep
still
at
last
they
reached
the
place
de
the
carriages
conforming
to
rule
rounded
the
monument
on
the
right
going
more
and
more
slowly
owing
to
the
increased
crush
but
the
captain
felt
relieved
only
one
cab
drawn
by
a
horse
now
separated
him
from
bobinette
taxi
and
assuredly
her
vehicle
and
his
would
be
abreast
side
by
side
at
the
entry
to
the
avenue
of
the
bois
de
boulogne
brocq
loved
bobinette
dearly
but
frankly
if
for
a
joke
or
inadvertently
she
had
carried
off
the
document
he
would
give
her
a
piece
of
his
mind
he
would
let
her
know
that
it
would
not
do
to
play
tricks
with
things
of
that
sort
nevertheless
his
heart
was
wrung
with
anxiety
supposing
bobinette
had
noticed
nothing
if
the
document
had
fallen
in
the
street
suddenly
the
poor
fellow
saw
bobinette
taxi
cut
across
the
line
of
carriages
to
the
right
and
turn
into
the
avenue
de
la
brocq
chauffeur
did
not
seem
to
have
noticed
this
he
continued
in
the
direction
of
the
bois
de
boulogne
oh
you
idiot
shouted
the
captain
and
in
order
to
give
his
instructions
as
rapidly
as
possible
he
leaned
almost
entirely
out
of
the
vehicle
but
a
second
or
two
had
passed
when
the
chauffeur
stopped
dead
that
he
might
see
what
had
happened
to
his
fare
something
must
have
happened
for
brocq
had
abruptly
stopped
short
in
the
midst
of
his
directions
he
had
collapsed
on
the
cushions
of
the
taxi
and
remained
motionless
other
vehicles
surrounded
the
automobile
some
ladies
passing
in
a
victoria
noticed
the
captain
look
my
dear
exclaimed
one
of
them
do
you
see
how
pale
that
man
is
he
seems
to
be
ill
at
the
same
moment
the
pedestrians
were
struck
by
the
strange
attitude
brocq
had
suddenly
subsided
in
a
heap
on
the
cushion
his
head
had
fallen
to
one
side
his
mouth
was
open
his
eyes
were
closed
he
seemed
to
have
fainted
a
crowd
gathered
at
once
the
chauffeur
got
down
shook
his
fare
by
the
arm
and
the
arm
was
inert
the
crowd
increased
a
doctor
cried
a
voice
it
is
plain
that
this
man
is
ill
a
man
stepped
out
from
the
crowd
his
hair
was
white
he
wore
a
decoration
ribbon
and
he
had
descended
from
a
private
brougham
with
an
air
of
authority
he
made
his
way
through
the
curious
onlookers
and
when
a
constable
came
forward
he
said
kindly
make
these
people
stand
away
i
am
professor
barrell
of
the
school
of
medicine
there
was
a
murmur
of
respectful
sympathy
among
the
onlookers
for
the
professor
was
famous
this
master
of
medicine
with
a
sure
hand
had
undone
the
collar
the
cravat
of
the
mysterious
sufferer
half
opened
his
overcoat
put
his
ear
to
the
patient
heart
then
straightening
himself
considered
the
face
attentively
not
without
a
certain
amount
of
stupefaction
the
constable
made
a
suggestion
had
we
not
better
take
this
individual
to
a
chemist
professor
barrell
replied
in
a
low
voice
to
a
chemist
do
so
if
you
wish
but
it
is
useless
you
would
do
better
to
go
to
the
this
unfortunate
man
is
dead
it
is
a
case
of
sudden
death
the
medical
man
added
some
technical
words
which
this
guardian
of
the
peace
did
not
understand

the
superintendent
hung
up
the
telephone
receiver
and
turned
to
the
policeman
who
stood
motionless
awaiting
orders
he
was
visibly
embarrassed
the
police
superintendent
of
the
wagram
quarter
was
a
man
of
decisive
action
he
possessed
in
the
highest
degree
the
quality
the
most
precious
of
all
for
those
of
the
police
force
whose
functions
call
them
to
intervene
continually
in
the
most
surprising
adventures
presence
of
mind
a
few
minutes
before
this
the
taxi
with
its
tragic
burden
had
stopped
at
his
and
the
men
on
duty
had
carried
in
the
body
of
the
unfortunate
captain
called
in
all
haste
the
sergeant
had
immediately
made
a
rapid
investigation
he
examined
the
documents
in
the
victim
portfolio
here
a
go
he
muttered
of

eastern
fortresses

important
documents

than

had
immediately
telephoned
to
headquarters
reassured
by
the
sergeant
reply
the
superintendent
turned
to
the
policeman

made
out

report
he
asked
curtly
the
honest
guardian
of
the
peace
touched
his
cap
looked
perplexed
and
scratched
his
head
not
yet
monsieur
no
time

but
i
will
write
it
out
at
once
the
superintendent
smiled
at
his
embarrassed
subordinate

do
it
together
let
us
see
now
the
deceased
was
a
captain
is
that
so
the
papers
found
in
his
portfolio
and
the
name
written
on
it
let
us
know
that
he
was
called
brocq
and
that
he
was
attached
to
the
ministry
so
much
for
his
identity
we
will
not
trouble
about
his
domicile
the
place
will
tell
us
that
now
let
us
go
into
the
details
of
the
accident
tell
me
my
man
exactly
how
his
death
occurred
again
the
worthy
guardian
of
the
peace
scratched
his
head
with
an
anxious
look
i
saw
nothing
of
it
monsieur
he
replied
and
the
you
have
his
deposition
he
did
not
see
anything
either
monsieur
call
this
chauffeur
a
few
minutes
after
the
superintendent
dismissed
the
chauffeur
a
short
interrogation
revealed
that
the
had
not
only
seen
nothing
but
that
he
could
do
nothing
to
help
the
enquiry
the
superintendent
recalled
the
honest
policeman
come
now
you
are
certain
that
the
victim
died
immediately
well
you
see
monsieur
while
i
was
dispersing
the
crowd
a
doctor
came
up
and
it
was
he
who
told
me
how
the
dead
man
died
this
doctor
did
not
point
out
to
you
the
cause
of
death
no
monsieur
but
he
gave
me
his
card
the
policeman
drew
from
the
pocket
of
his
tunic
a
dirty
he
took
a
card
from
it
and
handed
it
to
his
chief
there
monsieur
the
magistrate
looked
at
the
name
barrell
of
the
school
of
turning
the
card
he
read
aloud
a
few
words
in
pencil
death
which
seems
due
to
a
phenomenon
of
this
professor
did
not
explain
what
he
meant
by
due
to
inhibition
no
monsieur
annoying
i
do
not
know
what
that
means
the
superintendent
was
about
to
continue
his
enquiry
when
there
was
a
knock
at
his
office
door
a
policeman
informed
him
respectfully
there
is
an
inspector
monsieur
from
headquarters
detective
department
who
asks
to
see
you
on
urgent
business
he
declares
you
have
sent
for
him
tell
him
to
come
in
no
sooner
had
this
personage
from
headquarters
detective
department
appeared
in
the
doorway
than
the
superintendent
rose
and
advanced
with
outstretched
hands
you
juve
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
how
are
you
it
was
in
truth
the
celebrated
detective
juve
juve
had
altered
but
little
he
was
always
the
same
man
rather
vigorous
astonishingly
alive
agile
as
youthful
as
ever
in
spite
of
his
moustache
turning
grey
in
spite
of
his
rounded
shoulders
which
at
moments
seemed
to
bend
under
the
weight
of
the
toils
and
fatigues
of
the
past
this
magic
name
evoked
memories
of
terrible
stories
stories
of
dangers
encountered
endured
overcome
of
brave
deeds
of
desperate
struggles
with
the
worst
criminals
juve
he
was
the
man
who
for
ten
years
had
represented
to
all
ability
audacity
limitless
daring
he
was
the
man
who
best
knew
how
to
employ
wiles
and
stratagems
to
secure
the
triumph
of
society
in
the
incessant
combat
it
had
to
sustain
against
the
innumerable
soldiers
of
the
army
of
crime
when
the
terrible
dollon
affair
had
come
to
an
end
juve
had
been
blamed
officially
and
the
detective
could
not
help
feeling
angry
and
exasperated
for
after
all
if
he
had
failed
he
ought
not
to
have
been
treated
as
a
culprit
not
a
soul
had
had
the
slightest
suspicion
of
how
the
affair
had
ended
not
one
of
them
knew
the
incredible
truth
how
the
marvellous
the
redoubtable
the
incredible
fantômas
had
elected
to
make
his
escape
at
the
very
moment
when
juve
was
preparing
to
put
the
handcuffs
on
him
and
the
detective
disheartened
but
determined
not
to
give
up
the
fight
against
this
criminal
whom
he
had
been
pursuing
for
years
had
asked
for
a
few
weeks
holiday
had
lain
snug
then
had
returned
to
his
post
at
headquarters
had
made
a
point
of
keeping
in
the
background
only
awaiting
the
moment
when
he
could
resume
his
hunt
for
the
ruffian
whom
he
looked
on
as
a
personal
enemy
since
then
nothing
had
happened
to
put
him
on
the
track
of
fantômas
no
crime
had
been
committed
in
circumstances
which
could
leave
him
to
think
that
this
elusive
murderer
was
involved
in
it
our
detective
had
begun
to
ask
himself
if
not
having
been
fortunate
enough
to
arrest
this
king
of
assassins
he
had
not
at
any
rate
succeeded
in
unmasking
him
in
compelling
him
to
fly
for
his
life
in
putting
him
out
of
power
to
do
harm
rapidly
the
superintendent
put
juve
in
possession
of
the
incidents
which
had
led
him
to
telephone
to
headquarters
you
have
done
well
said
juve
have
you
the
portfolio
of
this
dead
man
here
it
is
my
friend
juve
opened
it
if
you
will
allow
it
monsieur
i
am
going
to
make
a
complete
list
of
the
contents
this
list
i
shall
leave
with
you
i
shall
take
a
copy
that
i
shall
deposit
at
the
office
of
the
chief
of
staff
obtaining
a
receipt
for
it
this
will
relieve
both
you
and
myself
of
all
further
responsibility
on
this
head
for
some
moments
juve
and
the
superintendent
occupied
themselves
in
going
over
the
papers
of
the
dead
man
suddenly
the
detective
got
up
and
holding
a
paper
in
his
hand
began
walking
up
and
down
the
room
you
have
read
that
he
asked
turning
to
the
superintendent
what
is
it
no
read
it
the
superintendent
read
of
the
documents
which
were
submitted
to
me
by
the
second
bureau
of
the
staff
headquarters
for
which
i
have
signed
a
receipt
and
i
have
undertaken

return
and
deliver
them
up
to
the
second
bureau
of
the
staff
headquarters
monday
november
when
given
a
receipt
to

of
it
well
replied
juve

the
documents
given
on
this
list
with
those
we
have
found
in
this
portfolio

of
course

only
proves
i
imagine
that
this
officer
died
at
the
very
moment
when
he
was
on
the
way
to
his
office
to
return
the
papers
entrusted
to
him
what
do
you
see
surprising
in
that
juve
shook
his
head
i
see
monsieur
that
what
i
feared
is
true
yes
this
is
certainly
the
list
of
documents
contained
in
this
portfolio
but
one
is
missing
the
two
men
checked
the
papers
of
captain
brocq
juve
was
right
there
was
a
document
missing
number
six
whew
murmured
the
superintendent
how
are
we
to
know
whether
this
document
has
been
dropped
in
the
taxi
or
has
already
been
returned
by
the
captain
or
or
whether
it
has
been
stolen
from
him
finished
juve
the
supposition
which
the
detective
had
put
into
words
was
so
grave
so
terrible
so
weighty
in
its
consequence
that
the
superintendent
cried
in
a
shaking
voice
robbed
robbed
but
by
whom
where
how
on
the
way
from
the
place
de
here
while
the
body
was
being
brought
to
the
police
station
juve
it
incredible
juve
was
walking
up
and
down
up
and
down
i
do
like
affairs
of
this
sort
in
which
officers
are
involved
and
most
particularly
officers
connected
with
the
second
bureau
of
the
military
staff
they
require
the
most
careful
handling
you
never
know
where
they
will
lead
these
officers
are
owing
to
their
functions
the
masters
of
all
the
military
defences
of
france
confound
it
juve
stopped
short
you
had
better
let
me
see
the
body
of
this
poor
fellow
certainly
the
superintendent
led
juve
towards
one
of
the
rooms
where
the
corpse
of
captain
brocq
was
it
had
been
laid
down
on
the
floor
pious
hands
had
lighted
a
mortuary
candle
and
in
view
of
the
position
held
by
the
dead
man
two
of
the
police
staff
were
keeping
watch
and
ward
until
someone
came
to
claim
the
body
of
the
deceased
juve
examined
the
corpse
a
fine
fellow
he
said
quietly
he
turned
to
the
superintendent
you
told
me
just
now
that
barrell
chanced
to
be
present
at
the
moment
of
death
that
is
so
what
did
he
suppose
was
the
cause
of
death
the
superintendent
smiled
now
you
have
it
possibly
you
can
throw
light
on
it
my
dear
juve
for
i
could
hardly
make
head
or
tail
of
his
diagnostic
the
professor
claims
that
death
is
due
to
a
of
what
does
that
mean
exactly
juve
shrugged
his
shoulders
inhibition
peuh
it
is
a
learned
word
very
learned
which
means
to
say
pressed
the
superintendent
it
does
not
mean
anything
juve
tone
was
a
mixture
of
contempt
and
anger
the
superintendent
was
staggered
juve
anger
increased
it
does
not
mean
anything
he
repeated
inhibition
inhibition
it
is
the
term
reserved
for
deaths
that
are
unexplained
and
inexplicable
it
is
the
term
with
which
science
covers
herself
when
she
does
not
wish
to
confess
her
ignorance
the
magistrate
was
smiling
now
so
then
juve
you
conclude
that
professor
barrell
has
declared
that
this
officer
had
died
through
inhibition
because
in
fact
he
was
ignorant
of
the
cause
of
death
exactly
snapped
juve
he
was
kneeling
on
the
floor
bending
over
the
body
slowly
minutely
he
was
examining
it
with
his
keen
eyes
by
the
flickering
light
of
the
mortuary
candle
he
had
examined
successively
the
face
of
the
dead
man
then
the
arms
the
trunk
the
shoulders
the
whole
body
he
did
not
utter
a
word
what
are
you
looking
for
in
particular
juve
the
cause
of
this
replied
the
detective
who
pronounced
the
word
with
unconcealed
anger
and
resentment
he
seemed
to
harbour
some
subtle
rancour
regarding
the
doctor
suddenly
he
got
up
and
turning
to
the
policeman
commanded
undress
this
body
the
superintendent
interposed
what
for
it
will
be
useful
for
your
report
come
now
in
what
way
for
that
said
juve
pointing
a
finger
at
the
officer
short
coat
that
how
that
i
do
see
anything
protested
the
superintendent
juve
knelt
down
again
and
made
a
sign
to
the
superintendent
to
do
likewise
look
monsieur
just
bend
down
and
look
at
this
tiny
graze
on
the
cloth
yes
well
does
that
not
tell
you
anything
no
it
does
not
juve
rose
and
repeated
his
order
unclothe
this
corpse
then
turning
to
the
superintendent
he
added
what
that
tells
me
is
that
this
man
has
been
killed
by
a
shot
from
a
gun
or
a
revolver
oh
come
now
you
will
the
garment
is
not
juve
began
to
smile
monsieur
said
he
you
must
know
that
arms
of
high
penetrating
power
firing
projectiles
of
small
diameter
grooved
projectiles
cause
only
the
slightest
graze
in
the
materials
they
pass
through
the
damage
is
almost
imperceptible
numerous
experiments
have
demonstrated
this
you
see
the
passage
of
the
projectile
is
so
rapid
its
gyratory
movement
so
accelerated
that
in
some
way
the
threads
of
the
fabric
are
not
broken
they
are
only
pushed
aside
they
come
together
again
after
the
passage
of
the
ball
and
unless
a
very
careful
examination
is
made
one
would
never
know
that
a
projectile
had
perforated
the
material
the
two
policemen
were
undressing
the
corpse
scarcely
had
they
undone
the
waistcoat
than
the
shirt
of
the
unfortunate
man
was
seen
to
have
a
spot
of
blood
on
it
in
the
region
of
the
heart
see
cried
juve
it
is
just
as
i
said
a
ball
of
small
diameter
propelled
by
a
formidable
power
of
penetration
has
caused
immediate
death
producing
a
wound
which
has
hardly
bled
at
all
so
precise
and
clean
has
the
wound
been
juve
again
bent
over
the
corpse
it
is
plain
to
see
that
this
officer
death
has
been
caused
by
a
ball
in
the
heart
right
in
the
centre
of
the
heart
the
superintendent
now
protested
but
what
you
are
telling
us
juve
is
terrible
it
is
inadmissible
how
could
this
person
have
committed
suicide
without
having
been
seen
in
the
act
by
someone
without
anyone
finding
his
revolver
and
that
at
the
very
moment
when
he
leaned
out
of
the
window
of
the
vehicle
to
give
the
chauffeur
his
instructions
juve
did
not
seem
disposed
to
answer
this
but
after
remaining
silent
for
a
minute
or
two
he
took
the
superintendent
by
the
arm
in
familiar
fashion
and
drawing
him
away
said
let
us
return
to
your
office
i
have
a
couple
of
words
to
say
to
you
when
the
superintendent
and
the
detective
had
entered
the
room
when
they
were
alone
together
when
the
detective
had
made
sure
that
the
double
door
was
shut
tight
and
that
not
a
soul
could
hear
them
juve
his
hands
resting
on
the
looked
the
superintendent
straight
in
the
face
the
latter
having
seated
himself
in
his
chair
waited
for
the
detective
to
speak
juve
spoke
we
are
thoroughly
agreed
monsieur
are
we
not
regarding
the
conditions
of
the
accident
this
officer
has
been
shot
through
the
heart
when
he
was
crossing
the
place
de
in
a
vehicle
and
at
the
precise
moment
when
he
leaned
over
the
door
of
that
vehicle
and
this
without
anyone
having
seen
or
heard
what
happened
yes
juve
that
is
so
this
suicide
is
incomprehensible
it
is
not
a
case
of
suicide
what
is
it
then
a
crime
a
crime
this
man
has
been
killed
by
a
shot
from
a
gun
a
shot
fired
from
a
distance
no
one
saw
the
assassin
do
the
deed
the
place
de
was
crowded
with
people
it
was
a
shot
fired
from
a
distance
because
of
an
important
point
monsieur
the
deceased
was
attached
to
the
second
bureau
of
the
ministry
of
war
at
the
time
of
his
death
he
was
the
bearer
of
important
documents
one
of
these
important
documents
is
missing
i
assure
you
monsieur
this
not
only
determines
the
fact
of
the
crime
but
furnishes
us
with
the
motive
for
that
crime
the
superintendent
of
police
stared
at
juve
speechless
at
last
he
said
but
it
is
impossible
absolutely
impossible
i
tell
you
what
you
are
inventing
now
is
impossible
you
forget
that
a
shot
from
a
gun
a
shot
from
so
powerful
a
weapon
makes
a
noise
why
deuce
take
it
the
detonation
must
be
heard
no
monsieur
there
are
now
weapons
which
are
perfectly
silent
for
example
there
are
guns
in
which
liquefied
carbonic
acid
is
used
which
fires
a
projectile
at
more
than
yards
and
all
that
can
be
heard
is
a
sharp
snap
when
the
projectile
speeds
but
look
here
juve
such
a
crime
as
this
partakes
of
the
nature
of
a
romance
the
criminal
must
have
taken
aim
in
the
midst
of
a
crowd
who
do
you
suppose
would
have
been
mad
enough
to
attempt
it
what
scoundrel
would
ever
have
run
such
a
risk
juve
very
calm
very
much
master
of
himself
was
standing
in
front
of
the
superintendent
his
arms
were
crossed
he
seemed
to
defy
him
as
though
he
knew
beforehand
that
in
him
he
was
to
encounter
the
incredulity
of
the
average
person
you
ask
me
replied
he
what
criminal
could
be
daring
enough
to
do
this
what
criminal
would
have
carried
out
such
a
murder
successfully
sir
that
murderer
name
is
synonymous
with
all
the
maddest
attempts
with
every
kind
of
atrocity
with
every
species
of
cruelty
with
all
the
talents
and
it
juve
suddenly
stopped
short
as
if
he
were
afraid
of
the
word
he
was
about
to
pronounce
by
jove
he
declared
if
i
knew
the
name
of
the
guilty
person
i
would
go
and
arrest
him
while
the
unfortunate
captain
brocq
collapsed
inside
his
carriage
mortally
struck
by
the
mysterious
shot
pretty
bobinette
who
could
have
had
no
idea
of
the
accident
to
her
lover
following
hard
in
her
wake
continued
her
drive
she
ordered
her
chauffeur
to
stop
at
the
which
passes
behind
the
chinese
pavilion
a
lingering
ray
of
sunshine
still
illuminated
the
thickets
of
the
bois
but
already
those
out
for
an
airing
were
hastening
towards
the
city
when
bobinette
discharging
her
taxi
entered
the
little
path
which
runs
beside
the
equestrian
track
she
seemed
full
of
the
joy
of
life
stepping
smartly
along
appreciating
the
pleasure
of
this
quick
free
independent
walk
soon
however
her
pace
slackened
she
spied
an
unoccupied
seat
looked
at
her
watch
and
sat
down
she
cast
a
sharp
glance
towards
the
far
end
of
the
path
we
are
both
up
to
time
she
murmured
recognising
a
figure
still
some
distance
away
bobinette
drew
from
her
muff
a
small
roll
of
papers
the
advancing
person
was
a
individual
stooping
seemingly
bent
under
the
weight
of
a
bulky
accordion
he
looked
about
sixty
his
long
white
beard
untrimmed
and
badly
neglected
disguised
the
lower
half
of
his
face
while
his
luxuriant
moustache
and
his
long
hair
arranged
artist
fashion
largely
hid
the
upper
part
of
his
countenance
a
beggar
not
at
all
this
personage
would
most
certainly
have
spurned
such
an
epithet
with
a
gesture
of
offended
disdain
live
by
charity
not
he
was
not
his
accordion
there
to
show
that
he
possessed
a
regular
means
of
livelihood
he
claimed
to
be
a
musician
he
was
well
known
throughout
one
quarter
of
paris
was
this
poor
old
man
who
chanced
to
be
passing
along
that
path
in
the
bois
de
boulogne
he
was
a
perfect
specimen
of
the
unsettled
type
of
human
being
savagely
enamoured
of
liberty
going
from
court
to
court
playing
with
wearied
arms
the
ballads
of
the
moment
indifferent
to
their
melodies
to
their
rhythms
to
their
beauties
to
their
ugliness
no
one
knew
his
real
name
they
called
him
for
his
plaintive
notes
inspired
sad
thoughts
and
an
indefinable
trouble
of
the
nerves
in
those
unlucky
enough
to
listen
to
him
for
a
time
this
nickname
stuck
to
him
he
was
quite
a
parisian
type
this
vagualame
one
of
those
faces
at
once
odd
and
classic
such
as
one
comes
across
in
numbers
on
the
pavements
known
to
all
the
world
without
anyone
knowing
exactly
who
they
are
how
they
live
where
they
go
or
whence
they
come
the
old
man
had
on
his
side
caught
sight
of
bobinette
he
hastened
towards
her
as
fast
as
his
legs
permitted
and
as
soon
as
he
was
near
enough
to
speak
to
her
without
raising
his
voice
he
questioned
her
well
it
was
the
interrogation
of
a
master
to
a
subordinate
well
he
repeated
his
tone
was
anxious
bobinette
calmed
the
old
man
apprehensions
with
a
nod
it
done
said
she
holding
out
to
him
the
roll
of
paper
she
added
i
could
only
get
them
at
the
last
minute
but
i
got
them
and
i
do
fancy
he
suspects
anything
as
bobinette
uttered
these
last
words
the
old
accordion
player
chuckled
sneeringly
so
that
what
you
think
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
evident
that
he
suspects
nothing
now
the
way
in
which
the
old
man
pronounced
the
word
now
puzzled
the
girl
what
do
you
mean
captain
brocq
is
dead
dead
although
she
did
not
love
her
lover
much
at
this
startling
piece
of
news
bobinette
had
jumped
up
wringing
her
hands
in
horror
she
grew
strangely
pale
yes
dead
replied
vagualame
coldly
kindly
sit
down
please
see
to
it
that
you
play
your
part
you
are
a
young
woman
speaking
to
an
old
beggar
and
you
are
not
to
forget
it
bobinette
sat
down
mechanically
she
questioned
him
and
her
voice
was
trembling
dead
what
has
happened
then
what
has
happened
is
that
you
have
played
the
fool
brocq
saw
clearly
that
you
had
stolen
the
document
from
him
he
saw
yes
he
saw
it
i
had
my
suspicions
fortunately
then
this
cursed
captain
threw
himself
into
a
taxi
and
followed
you
at
the
moment
when
your
own
auto
turned
on
the
place
de
his
was
going
to
meet
it
brocq
was
already
hailing
you
and
you
would
have
been
caught
without
a
doubt
had
i
not
come
to
the
rescue
great
heavens
what
have
you
done
i
have
just
told
you
a
bullet
in
his
heart
and
he
remains
on
the
bobinette
was
dumbfounded
she
did
not
speak
for
a
minute
or
two
then
she
asked
anxiously
but
where
were
you
that
does
not
concern
you
what
must
i
say
then
if
by
chance
i
am
questioned
what
must
you
say
the
i
am
to
confess
that
i
knew
him
vagualame
tapped
his
foot
impatiently
how
stupid
you
are
there
is
one
thing
you
must
understand
at
the
present
moment
it
is
almost
certain
that
this
good
fellow
identity
has
been
established
the
devil
in
it
if
some
policeman
is
not
at
his
domicile
already
and
if
enquiry
is
not
being
made
into
the
life
of
captain
brocq
to
learn
that
he
is
on
terms
of
acquaintanceship
with
your
patron
de
naarboveck
is
child
play
to
prove
that
he
has
received
a
visit
from
you
to
prove
that
you
were
his
mistress
or
at
the
very
least
that
you
had
come
on
an
errand
from
naarboveck
daughter
wilhelmine
why
anybody
can
discover
that
you
will
read
the
details
in
all
the
papers
for
the
reporters
are
going
to
get
hold
of
this
affair
it
is
inevitable
consequently
do
you
not
deny
anything
it
would
only
compromise
you
to
no
good
purpose
you
will
vagualame
stopped
short
he
raised
the
accordion
which
he
carried
slung
over
his
shoulder
saying
in
a
whisper
people
are
coming
i
leave
you
i
will
see
you
again
if
necessary
do
not
be
anxious
i
take
all
on
my
own
shoulders
attention
and
suddenly
changing
his
tone
he
began
to
speak
in
a
voice
calculated
to
excite
pity
grateful
thanks
kind
lady
the
good
god
will
rain
blessings
on
you
for
it
i
thank
you

jérôme
fandor
the
journalist
editorial
contributor
to
the
popular
evening
paper
was
in
a
gay
mood
and
showed
it
by
singing
at
the
top
of
his
voice
at
the
risk
of
rousing
the
neighbourhood
in
his
very
comfortable
little
flat
rue
richer
where
he
had
lived
for
a
number
of
years
the
young
journalist
was
coming
and
going
busily
cupboards
drawers
wardrobes
were
opened
wide
garments
piles
of
linen
were
spread
about
in
all
the
rooms
on
the
table
a
large
travelling
bag
lay
open
into
this
with
the
aid
of
his
housekeeper
jérôme
fandor
was
feverishly
packing
the
spare
things
he
required
and
was
talking
in
joking
fashion
with
his
old
servant
angélique
presently
she
asked
rather
anxiously
are
you
likely
to
be
away
a
long
time
sir
the
journalist
shook
his
head
and
murmured
i
should
like
to
be
but
you
do
suppose
we
journalists
get
holidays
of
that
sort
still
anxious
angélique
went
on
perhaps
you
intend
to
change
your
housekeeper
when
you
return
monsieur
fandor
nevertheless
you
are
really
mad
angélique
have
i
not
told
you
twenty
times
that
i
am
going
away
for
a
fortnight
holiday
never
for
a
moment
have
i
thought
of
getting
rid
of
you
quite
the
contrary
i
am
delighted
with
the
way
you
do
your
work
there
now
i
shall
go
by
way
of
monaco
i
promise
to
put
five
francs
on
the
red
for
you
on
the
red
questioned
old
angélique
yes
it
a
game
if
red
the
winner
there
will
be
a
present
for
you
hurry
off
now
and
bring
up
my
trousers
whilst
his
housekeeper
hastened
downstairs
fandor
went
to
the
window
and
with
a
questioning
glance
considered
the
dull
grey
sky
disgusting
weather
he
murmured
but
what
do
i
care
for
that
i
am
going
to
the
sun
of
the
south
ah
to
the
sun
he
laughed
a
great
laugh
of
satisfaction
how
he
had
looked
forward
to
this
holiday
how
he
had
longed
for
it
this
holiday
he
was
going
to
take
now
after
months
of
uninterrupted
work
during
those
months
in
his
capacity
of
chief
reporter
to
scarcely
a
day
had
passed
without
his
having
some
move
to
make
some
strange
happening
to
clear
up
even
some
criminal
to
pursue
for
jérôme
fandor
belonged
to
that
species
of
active
and
restless
beings
who
are
ceaselessly
at
work
ready
for
action
bent
on
doing
things
an
activity
due
partly
to
temperament
partly
to
conscience
added
to
this
his
profession
interested
him
enormously
at
the
commencement
of
his
career
and
that
of
journalism
is
a
ticklish
one
he
had
been
greatly
helped
by
juve
whose
knowledge
and
advice
had
been
invaluable
to
him
fandor
had
been
involved
particularly
during
the
last
few
years
in
the
most
sensational
crimes
in
the
most
mysterious
affairs
and
whether
by
chance
or
voluntarily
he
had
played
a
real
part
in
them
he
had
not
been
content
to
take
up
the
position
of
onlooker
and
historian
only
fandor
had
made
his
post
an
important
one
he
had
to
be
seriously
reckoned
with
he
had
enemies
adversaries
far
from
contemptible
and
time
and
again
the
journalist
who
with
his
friend
juve
had
taken
part
in
terrible
had
attracted
towards
himself
venomous
hatreds
all
the
more
disquieting
in
that
his
adversaries
were
of
those
who
keep
in
the
shade
and
never
come
into
the
open
for
a
tussle
finally
and
above
all
fandor
coupled
with
his
friend
detective
juve
had
either
distinguished
himself
gloriously
or
covered
himself
with
ridicule
but
in
either
case
he
had
attracted
public
attention
by
his
epic
combats
with
the
most
deadly
personality
of
the
age
the
elusive
fantômas
but
our
journalist
whistling
the
latest
air
all
the
rage
gave
no
thought
to
all
that
he
was
reveling
in
the
idea
that
a
few
hours
hence
he
would
be
installed
in
a
comfortable
sleeping
compartment
to
awake
next
morning
on
the
wonderful
côte
inundated
with
light
drenched
in
the
perfume
of
tropical
flowers
bathed
in
the
radiance
of
eternal
summer
ah
then
eight
hundred
miles
and
more
would
separate
him
from
the
offices
of
of
the
police
stations
of
wretched
dens
and
hovels
with
their
pestilential
smells
would
separate
him
from
this
everlasting
bad
weather
from
the
cold
the
wet
which
were
the
ordinary
concomitants
of
his
daily
existence
to
the
devil
with
all
that
no
more
copy
to
feed
printer
and
paper
with
no
more
people
to
be
interviewed
hurrah
here
were
the
holidays
it
was
leave
of
absence
and
liberty
the
telephone
bell
rang
fandor
hesitated
a
moment
should
he
answer
it
according
to
custom
the
journalist
had
left
the
evening
before
he
could
plead
his
leave
which
was
in
order
and
say
like
louis
xiv
after
me
the
deluge
this
famous
saying
would
have
suited
the
moment
for
it
was
at
that
instant
precisely
that
an
inky
cloud
burst
over
paris
and
emptied
torrents
of
water
over
the
darkened
city
perhaps
a
friend
had
rung
him
up
or
it
was
a
mistake
so
arguing
fandor
unhooked
the
receiver
having
listened
a
moment
he
instinctively
adopted
a
more
respectful
attitude
as
if
his
interlocutor
at
the
other
end
of
the
line
could
see
him
fandor
replied
in
quick
monosyllables
closing
the
conversation
with
these
words
agreed
presently
then
chief
as
the
journalist
hung
up
the
receiver
his
expression
changed
he
frowned
and
pulling
at
his
moustache
with
a
nervous
hand
fretting
and
fuming
hang
it
it
only
wanted
this
he
grumbled
fandor
had
been
called
up
by
dupont
of
the
opportunist
deputy
who
was
the
manager
of
as
well
dupont
was
only
a
nominal
manager
and
generally
contented
himself
with
writing
up
his
editorial
without
even
taking
it
to
the
office
he
left
the
real
management
to
his
whose
function
was
that
of
thus
fandor
had
been
extremely
astonished
when
his
head
as
he
was
called
in
the
editorial
department
had
rung
him
up
dupont
had
summoned
him
to
the
chamber
of
deputies
for
three
in
the
afternoon
his
chief
wished
to
give
him
some
information
for
an
article
on
a
matter
which
interested
him
particularly
fandor
was
puzzled
anxious
what
could
it
be
the
chief
could
not
know
that
he
was
taking
his
holiday
bah
said
he
dupont
evidently
does
not
know
i
will
go
to
our
and
will
explain
my
approaching
departure
to
him
and
the
devil
in
it
if
he
does
not
pass
on
this
bit
of
reporting
to
one
of
my
colleagues
madame
angélique
continued
fandor
in
a
joyous
voice
turning
to
the
breathless
old
housekeeper
who
had
just
come
back
laden
with
parcels
get
me
lunch
quickly
then
you
must
strap
up
my
portmanteau
this
evening
i
am
going
to
make
off
whatever
happens
for
two
hours
interminable
hours
they
seemed
fandor
had
waited
for
dupont
in
the
hall
des
perdus
of
the
the
deputy
was
at
a
sitting
of
the
chamber
if
the
ushers
were
to
be
believed
the
discussion
was
likely
to
go
on
interminably
several
times
our
young
journalist
had
thought
he
would
simply
make
off
without
word
said
excusing
himself
on
the
score
of
a
misunderstanding
when
eight
hundred
odd
miles
lay
between
him
and
the
directorial
thunders
but
he
was
too
scrupulous
a
journalist
too
professionally
honest
to
follow
the
prompting
of
his
desires
footnote
hall
of
the
wandering
footsteps
so
champing
his
bit
fandor
had
stood
his
ground
as
he
was
looking
at
his
watch
for
the
hundred
and
fiftieth
time
he
quickly
rose
and
hastened
towards
two
men
who
came
out
of
a
corridor
they
were
dupont
and
a
personage
whom
fandor
recognised
at
once
he
bowed
respectfully
to
them
shaking
hands
with
the
cordial
dupont
who
said
to
his
companion
my
dear
minister
let
me
present
to
you
my
young
collaborator
jérôme
fandor
it
is
a
name
not
unknown
to
me
replied
the
minister
then
having
innumerable
calls
on
his
time
he
quickly
disappeared
a
few
minutes
after
in
one
of
the
little
reserved
for
parliamentary
commissions
the
manager
of
was
conversing
with
his
chief
reporter
it
was
not
to
present
me
to
the
minister
that
you
sent
for
me
my
dear
chief
unless
you
intend
to
get
me
an
appointment
as
in
which
in
which
case
questioned
dupont
gently
fandor
reply
was
frank
in
which
case
even
before
being
nominated
i
should
tender
you
my
resignation
it
is
not
a
profession
which
tempts
me
much
reassure
yourself
fandor
i
have
no
intention
whatever
of
sending
you
to
live
in
the
provinces
but
if
i
asked
you
to
see
me
here
it
was
with
reference
to
a
very
delicate
affair
about
which
i
mean
to
give
you
i
insist
on
this
word
good
thought
fandor
it
all
up
with
my
holiday
he
tried
to
ask
this
question
before
his
chief
went
into
details
but
dupont
interrupted
him
with
a
movement
of
his
hand
you
will
leave
for
your
holiday
a
few
hours
later
my
dear
fellow
and
you
can
take
eight
days
in
addition
fandor
bowed
he
could
not
dispute
his
chief
decision
and
he
had
gained
by
this
arrangement
my
dear
fandor
said
his
chief
coming
to
the
main
point
we
published
yesterday
evening
as
you
of
course
know
a
short
paragraph
on
the
death
of
an
artillery
officer
captain
brocq
there
is
something
mysterious
about
his
death
captain
brocq
who
owing
to
his
functions
was
attached
to
the
second
bureau
of
the
staff
headquarters
that
is
to
say
the
intelligence
department
was
in
touch
with
different
sets
of
people
it
would
be
interesting
to
get
some
information
about
them
i
mentioned
this
just
now
to
the
minister
of
war
and
to
the
minister
for
home
affairs
both
are
agreed
that
without
making
too
much
noise
about
this
incident
we
should
institute
enquiries
discreet
of
course
but
also
pretty
exhaustive
you
are
the
only
man
on
the
paper
possessed
of
the
necessary
tact
and
ability
to
carry
the
thing
through
successfully
an
hour
later
under
the
pouring
rain
fandor
with
trousers
his
greatcoat
collar
raised
was
walking
stoically
along
the
esplanade
des
invalides
which
was
feebly
lighted
by
a
few
scarcely
visible
he
reached
the
other
side
of
the
place
à
la
rue
fabert
looked
at
the
number
of
the
first
house
in
front
of
him
followed
the
pavement
a
moment
turning
his
back
on
the
seine
then
reached
the
avenue
de
la
by
way
of
the
rue
de
fandor
repeated
to
himself
the
final
words
of
his
instructions
interview
baron
de
naarboveck
get
into
touch
with
a
young
person
called
bobinette
find
out
who
and
what
are
the
frequenters
of
the
house
where
this
diplomat
lives
our
journalist
was
not
anxious
as
to
the
result
of
his
interview
it
was
not
his
first
experience
of
the
kind
and
this
time
his
task
was
rendered
especially
easy
owing
to
the
letter
of
introduction
which
dupont
had
given
him
in
order
that
he
might
have
a
talk
with
de
naarboveck
who
lived
in
a
sumptuous
mansion
in
the
rue
fabert
fandor
did
not
go
straight
ahead
to
this
interview
his
method
was
not
so
simple
after
identifying
the
front
of
the
house
wishing
to
know
the
immediate
neighbourhood
thoroughly
he
went
all
round
the
mass
of
houses
which
limited
the
rue
de
he
went
through
the
avenue
de
la
in
order
to
discover
whether
the
house
was
double
or
single
if
it
had
one
or
two
exits
fandor
was
too
much
a
detective
at
heart
to
neglect
the
smallest
detail
his
inspection
was
soon
done
the
house
possessed
two
entrances
that
in
the
avenue
de
la
was
for
the
use
of
the
servants
and
common
folk
only
the
front
door
opened
on
the
rue
fabert
a
courtyard
at
the
back
separated
it
from
the
avenue
de
la
the
house
consisted
of
three
storeys
and
a
approached
by
a
few
steps
fandor
returned
to
the
esplanade
des
invalides
and
walked
up
and
down
under
the
trees
for
some
time
watching
the
comings
and
goings
of
the
neighbourhood
at
a
quarter
to
seven
he
had
looked
at
his
watch
and
not
seeing
any
light
in
the
rooms
the
shutters
of
which
were
not
yet
closed
he
concluded
that
the
inmates
had
probably
not
come
in
just
then
fandor
saw
an
automobile
a
very
elegant
limousine
draw
up
before
de
naarboveck
house
a
man
of
a
certain
age
descended
from
it
and
vanished
in
the
shadow
of
a
doorway
the
door
had
opened
as
the
carriage
stopped
that
de
naarboveck
thought
fandor
then
he
saw
the
carriage
turn
and
move
away
the
carriage
goes
in
the
master
does
not
go
out
again
deduced
fandor
a
short
time
after
the
chauffeur
having
taken
off
his
livery
came
out
of
the
house
and
went
away
good
remarked
fandor
the
man
i
am
after
will
not
budge
from
the
house
the
next
to
enter
were
two
young
women
then
some
twenty
minutes
passed
the
rooms
on
the
first
floor
were
lit
up
one
after
the
other
the
house
was
waking
up
fandor
was
making
up
his
mind
to
ring
when
a
brought
a
fourth
person
to
the
door
it
was
a
young
man
smart
very
fair
wearing
a
long
thin
drooping
moustache
movements
and
appearance
spoke
his
profession
an
officer
in
mufti
beyond
question
fandor
once
more
encircled
the
house
he
had
reached
the
door
opening
on
to
the
avenue
de
la
when
he
saw
a
confectioner
boy
slip
into
the
house
dupont
told
me
de
naarboveck
lived
alone
with
his
daughter
therefore
he
has
people
dining
with
him
this
evening
reasoned
the
journalist
he
then
decided
to
dine
himself
and
return
an
hour
and
a
half
later
naarboveck
well
dined
and
wined
could
give
him
more
time
and
would
be
the
easier
to
interview
of
an
hour
later
fandor
left
the
humble
where
he
had
dined
badly
in
the
company
of
coachmen
and
but
fully
informed
as
to
the
private
and
public
existence
of
the
person
he
was
going
to
interview
he
had
set
his
host
and
his
table
neighbours
gossiping
to
such
purpose
that
he
could
tell
at
what
time
de
naarboveck
rose
in
the
morning
what
his
habits
were
if
he
fasted
on
fridays
and
what
he
paid
for
his
cigars
monsieur
de
naarboveck
if
you
please
jérôme
fandor
had
rung
the
bell
of
the
front
entrance
in
the
rue
fabert
it
was
just
striking
nine
a
of
the
correct
stamp
appeared
he
lives
here
monsieur
fandor
offered
his
card
and
the
letter
of
introduction
from
dupont
please
see
that
these
are
handed
to
monsieur
de
naarboveck
and
find
out
if
he
can
receive
me
the
porter
having
decided
that
the
visitor
was
too
well
dressed
to
be
left
waiting
on
the
steps
signed
to
the
young
man
to
follow
him
the
porter
rang
and
a
footman
in
undress
livery
immediately
appeared
and
took
card
and
letter
from
the
porter
the
servant
looked
consideringly
at
fandor
name
engraved
on
the
card
stared
at
this
unknown
visitor
hoping
he
would
definitely
state
the
purpose
of
his
visit
but
the
journalist
remained
impassive
and
as
his
profession
was
not
indicated
on
his
card
the
servant
had
to
be
satisfied
with
his
own
curiosity
kindly
wait
here
a
moment
said
the
footman
in
a
fairly
civil
tone
of
voice
i
will
see
if
my
master
is
at
home
fandor
remained
alone
in
a
vast
hall
furnished
after
the
renaissance
manner
costly
tapestries
covered
the
walls
with
their
imposing
pictures
their
sumptuously
woven
epics
the
footman
quickly
returned
will
monsieur
kindly
follow
me
relieved
of
his
overcoat
fandor
obeyed
one
side
of
the
hall
opened
on
a
great
double
staircase
the
white
stone
of
which
turned
grey
with
the
passing
of
time
softened
by
a
thick
carpet
and
ornamented
by
a
marvellous
balustrade
of
delicately
wrought
a
masterpiece
of
the
xviith
century
the
lackey
opened
a
door
which
gave
access
to
a
magnificent
sparsely
furnished
with
pieces
of
the
best
louis
xiv
period
mirrors
reflected
the
canvases
of
famous
painters
family
pictures
of
immense
artistic
value
and
still
more
valuable
as
souvenirs
traversing
this
fine
apartment
they
passed
through
other
drawing
rooms
furnished
in
perfect
taste
fandor
reached
the
at
last
where
empire
furniture
was
judiciously
mingled
with
pieces
made
for
comfort
after
the
english
fashion
the
tawny
leather
of
which
harmonised
marvellously
with
the
of
the
ancient
mahogany
and
with
its
ancient
bronzes
the
lackey
pointed
to
a
chair
and
disappeared
by
jove
said
fandor
half
aloud
this
fine
fellow
has
done
himself
well
in
the
way
of
a
the
journalist
reflections
were
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
an
exceedingly
elegant
young
lady
fandor
rose
and
saluted
this
charming
apparition
iv
a
cordial
reception
the
journalist
had
naturally
expected
to
see
monsieur
de
naarboveck
enter
the
room
in
his
stead
came
this
pretty
girl
be
seated
i
beg
monsieur
she
entreated
she
is
his
daughter
thought
fandor
i
am
given
the
the
diplomatist
is
not
going
to
see
me
i
am
sorry
for
that
but
on
the
other
hand
here
is
this
delicious
creature
you
asked
to
see
monsieur
de
naarboveck
did
you
not
it
is
for
an
interview
no
doubt
monsieur
de
naarboveck
makes
it
a
point
of
honour
never
to
get
himself
written
about
in
the
newspapers
therefore
you
must
not
be
the
charming
girl
paused
fandor
bowed
and
smiled
he
said
to
himself
i
shall
have
to
listen
for
five
minutes
to
this
delightful
person
assuring
me
that
her
father
does
not
wish
to
talk
after
that
he
will
come
himself
and
will
tell
me
all
i
want
to
thus
he
listened
with
divided
attention
to
the
pretty
words
then
he
interjected
monsieur
your
his
companion
smiled
excuse
me
she
said
at
once
you
have
made
a
mistake
i
am
not
mademoiselle
wilhelmine
de
naarboveck
as
you
seem
to
imagine
i
am
merely
her
companion
i
dare
add
a
friend
of
the
house
they
call
me
mademoiselle
bobinette
cried
fandor
almost
in
spite
of
himself
he
immediately
regretted
this
too
familiar
interjection
but
that
young
person
did
not
take
offence
they
certainly
do
call
me
that
my
intimates
at
least
she
added
with
a
touch
of
malice
fandor
made
his
apology
in
words
at
once
playful
and
correct
he
must
do
all
in
his
power
to
make
himself
agreeable
fascinating
that
he
might
get
into
the
good
graces
of
this
girl
for
she
was
the
very
person
whom
it
behooved
him
to
interrogate
regarding
the
mysterious
adventure
the
outcome
of
which
had
been
the
death
of
captain
brocq
bobinette
had
answered
fandor
polite
remarks
by
protesting
that
she
was
not
in
the
least
offended
at
his
familiar
mode
of
address
alas
monsieur
she
had
declared
in
a
tone
slightly
sad
i
am
too
much
afraid
that
my
name
the
pet
name
my
friends
use
will
become
very
quickly
known
to
the
public
for
i
suppose
what
you
have
come
to
see
naarboveck
about
is
to
ask
him
for
information
regarding
this
sad
affair
we
have
all
been
thinking
so
much
about
now
we
have
come
to
it
thought
fandor
he
was
going
to
take
the
lead
in
this
conversation
but
the
young
woman
did
not
give
him
time
she
continued
in
a
rapid
tone
on
one
note
almost
as
if
she
had
repeated
a
lesson
learned
by
heart
baron
de
naarboveck
monsieur
can
not
tell
you
anything
that
you
do
not
already
know
except
and
there
is
no
secret
about
it
that
captain
brocq
used
to
come
here
pretty
regularly
he
has
dined
with
the
baron
frequently
and
they
have
worked
at
several
things
together
several
of
his
friends
officers
have
been
received
here
as
well
de
naarboveck
is
very
fond
of
and
then
he
has
a
daughter
has
he
not
interrupted
fandor
mademoiselle
wilhelmine
yes
fandor
nearly
added
a
daughter
to
get
married
it
seemed
clear
to
him
that
in
spite
of
her
timid
and
reserved
airs
this
beauty
seemed
to
like
the
idea
of
playing
a
part
in
the
drama
mademoiselle
questioned
fandor
it
has
been
reported
that
yesterday
afternoon
you
had
occasion
to
meet
captain
brocq
some
hours
before
his
sad
end
the
young
woman
stared
fixedly
at
the
journalist
as
if
to
read
his
thoughts
as
if
to
divine
whether
or
not
he
knew
that
not
only
had
she
met
captain
brocq
but
had
spent
some
time
with
him
alone
fandor
did
know
it
but
he
remained
impenetrable
bobinette
very
much
mistress
of
herself
said
quite
simply
it
is
a
fact
monsieur
that
i
did
see
captain
brocq
yesterday
i
had
to
give
him
a
message
you
will
think
me
very
inquisitive
continued
fandor
who
pretended
not
to
look
at
the
young
woman
in
order
to
put
her
more
at
her
ease
but
who
in
reality
did
not
lose
a
single
change
of
expression
on
her
pretty
face
for
he
could
watch
its
reflection
in
a
mirror
you
will
think
me
very
inquisitive
but
could
you
tell
me
the
nature
of
this
communication
bobinette
replied
quite
naturally
to
be
sure
i
can
monsieur
baron
de
naarboveck
is
giving
an
entertainment
here
shortly
and
the
captain
was
going
to
take
part
in
it
as
he
was
very
much
of
an
artist
we
counted
on
his
doing
some
menus
in
colour
for
us
i
simply
went
to
see
him
with
a
message
from
mademoiselle
the
conversation
stopped
short
fandor
had
turned
around
quickly
behind
him
doubtless
he
had
been
there
for
some
moments
a
man
was
standing
fandor
had
not
heard
him
enter
the
room
he
was
a
man
of
a
certain
age
his
moustache
was
quite
white
he
wore
the
whiskers
and
imperial
of
fandor
recognised
baron
naarboveck
he
was
going
to
apologise
for
not
having
noticed
his
entrance
but
de
naarboveck
smiled
at
the
journalist
with
apparent
cordiality
pardon
me
monsieur
fandor
for
not
having
received
you
myself
but
i
had
a
guest
moreover
mademoiselle
berthe
must
have
told
you
what
my
views
are
regarding
fandor
made
a
slight
gesture
the
baron
continued
oh
they
are
definite
unalterable
but
that
will
not
prevent
you
from
taking
a
cup
of
coffee
with
us
i
feel
sure
i
have
the
highest
esteem
for
monsieur
dupont
and
the
terms
in
which
he
has
recommended
you
to
me
are
such
that
from
now
on
i
have
not
the
slightest
hesitation
in
treating
you
as
one
of
ourselves
as
a
friend
monsieur
naarboveck
put
his
hand
familiarly
on
the
young
shoulder
and
led
him
into
the
next
room
it
was
a
library
a
very
lofty
room
it
was
soberly
and
elegantly
furnished
before
a
great
of
wood
two
young
people
were
standing
and
were
chatting
very
much
at
their
ease
they
paused
when
fandor
entered
close
behind
followed
mademoiselle
berthe
fandor
bowed
to
the
two
young
people
naarboveck
made
the
introductions
monsieur
jérôme
fandor
mademoiselle
de
naarboveck
my
daughter
monsieur
de
loubersac
lieutenant
of
cuirassiers
silence
reigned
after
these
formal
introductions
if
fandor
was
in
certain
measure
satisfied
with
the
turn
the
conversation
had
taken
he
was
really
bored
by
this
involuntary
intrusion
into
a
family
gathering
which
mattered
little
to
him
he
felt
he
had
been
caught
how
the
devil
was
he
going
to
escape
from
this
wasp
nest
his
eye
fell
on
a
timepiece
seeing
the
hour
he
thought
had
it
not
been
for
this
brocq
fellow
and
that
fool
of
a
dupont
i
should
now
be
in
the
train
asleep
and
rolling
along
towards
dijon
mademoiselle
de
naarboveck
with
the
ease
of
a
woman
offered
the
journalist
a
cup
of
boiling
hot
coffee
mademoiselle
berthe
suggested
sugar
monsieur
de
naarboveck
as
if
he
had
suddenly
remembered
something
said
to
him
but
you
bear
a
name
which
recalls
many
things
monsieur
jérôme
fandor
it
was
you
of
course
famous
journalist
that
you
are
who
some
time
ago
was
in
constant
pursuit
of
a
mysterious
ruffian
whom
they
called
fantômas
fandor
a
little
embarrassed
smiled
it
seemed
to
him
something
quite
abnormal
to
hear
fantômas
mentioned
in
this
gathering
so
simple
so
natural
so
commonplace
surely
this
criminal
his
adventures
the
police
and
even
reporting
must
partake
of
the
fantastic
the
imaginary
it
must
all
be
greek
to
such
conventional
people
nevertheless
as
monsieur
de
naarboveck
spoke
mademoiselle
berthe
drew
close
to
the
journalist
and
gazed
at
him
with
curiosity
but
tell
me
monsieur
may
i
ask
you
a
question
perhaps
it
is
my
turn
to
be
inquisitive
but
then
so
were
you
just
now
fandor
laughed
decidedly
this
young
and
pretty
person
was
charming
i
am
certainly
bound
to
reply
to
you
as
you
wish
mademoiselle
nodding
with
a
mischievous
look
and
casting
a
glance
at
the
baron
asking
his
approval
he
signified
his
consent
by
a
nod
she
demanded
with
an
innocently
curious
air
do
tell
me
monsieur
who
this
fantômas
is
fandor
stood
speechless
ah
this
question
which
this
young
woman
had
asked
so
naturally
as
if
it
referred
to
the
most
simple
thing
in
the
world
how
often
had
he
asked
himself
that
same
question
during
how
many
sleepless
nights
had
his
mind
not
been
full
of
it
and
he
had
never
been
able
to
find
a
satisfactory
answer
to
who
is
fantômas
fandor
had
been
asking
this
question
for
years
he
had
after
a
fashion
vowed
his
existence
to
the
search
for
this
mysterious
individual
how
often
and
often
in
the
course
of
his
investigation
in
the
midst
of
his
struggles
with
criminals
during
his
long
talks
and
conferences
with
juve
had
he
not
thought
that
he
had
run
the
bandit
to
earth
identified
him
was
going
to
drag
his
personality
out
into
the
broad
light
of
day
and
then
suddenly
fantômas
had
disappeared
fantômas
had
made
a
mock
of
him
of
juve
of
the
police
of
everybody
for
weeks
for
months
all
trace
of
him
was
lost
completely
then
one
fine
day
he
would
produce
a
drama
it
might
be
a
big
drama
which
took
public
opinion
captive
it
might
be
a
drama
in
appearance
insignificant
and
then
each
one
saw
and
followed
traces
which
were
more
or
less
normal
and
ordinarily
probable
fandor
and
juve
fandor
alone
or
juve
isolated
following
the
indications
which
only
their
perspicacity
enabled
them
to
discover
still
and
always
felt
the
presence
the
trace
of
this
monster
this
being
so
enigmatical
so
indefinable
who
was
terrorising
humanity
then
implacable
and
dangerous
pursuits
redoubtable
struggles
were
the
order
of
their
days
and
nights
juve
fandor
the
representatives
of
justice
one
and
all
united
to
reduce
the
circle
in
which
this
ruffian
revolved
and
at
the
moment
they
were
about
to
catch
him
he
would
fade
away
leaving
them
as
their
only
spoil
the
temporary
personality
with
which
he
had
clothed
himself
and
under
which
he
had
momentarily
deigned
to
make
himself
known
now
behold
here
was
this
little
creature
bobinette
who
asked
for
the
solution
of
this
formidable
incomprehensible
unprecedented
thing
wanted
it
straight
away
who
is
fantômas
fandor
attitude
his
expression
showed
how
surprised
he
was
at
such
a
question
de
naarboveck
emphasised
and
justified
the
astonishment
then
in
a
rather
dry
hard
voice
monsieur
de
loubersac
gave
his
opinion
my
dear
baron
do
you
think
that
for
several
years
past
we
have
been
made
sufficient
fools
of
with
all
these
fantômas
tales
for
my
part
i
do
believe
a
word
of
them
such
a
powerful
criminal
has
no
chance
nowadays
that
is
to
say
if
he
exists
one
must
see
life
in
its
true
proportions
and
recognise
that
it
is
very
but
monsieur
interrupted
mademoiselle
berthe
who
covered
with
blushes
scarcely
dared
raise
her
eyes
to
the
handsome
lieutenant
but
monsieur
for
all
that
fantômas
has
been
much
talked
about
the
young
officer
looked
the
beauty
up
and
down
bestowing
on
her
but
a
cursory
glance
fandor
noticed
that
bobinette
was
greatly
troubled
by
it
following
this
little
he
immediately
got
a
very
clear
impression
that
if
the
lieutenant
did
not
consider
the
pretty
girl
worthy
of
much
consideration
she
on
her
side
seemed
very
much
influenced
by
all
that
this
elegant
and
handsome
young
officer
said
or
did
fandor
had
noticed
too
while
the
talk
went
on
that
mademoiselle
de
naarboveck
was
deeply
moved
and
looked
sorrowful
she
was
a
graceful
girl
in
all
the
freshness
and
brilliancy
of
her
twenty
years
with
large
eyes
soft
and
luminous
her
natural
disposition
was
evidently
a
bright
and
gay
one
but
this
evening
sadness
overshadowed
her
and
to
such
a
point
that
in
spite
of
her
efforts
to
be
lively
and
pleasant
she
could
not
hide
her
sad
preoccupation
de
naarboveck
who
had
been
watching
fandor
closely
said
to
him
in
a
low
voice
wilhelmine
has
been
very
much
upset
by
this
terrible
accident
which
has
overtaken
our
friend
captain
brocq
and
just
then
the
harsh
sarcastic
tones
of
de
loubersac
broke
in
afresh
in
conclusion
exclaimed
the
lieutenant
i
maintain
that
fantômas
is
an
invention
a
more
or
less
original
one
i
am
ready
to
admit
but
an
invention
of
not
the
least
practical
interest
just
an
invention
of
the
detectives
this
fantômas
or
it
may
be
of
the
journalists
only
who
have
made
the
gaping
public
swallow
this
pill
this
enormous
pill
the
lieutenant
stared
at
fandor
defiantly
and
let
me
add
i
speak
from
knowledge
for
up
to
a
certain
point
i
know
all
these
individuals
fandor
was
not
in
the
least
impressed
by
the
lieutenant
aggressive
declarations
he
regarded
him
calmly
there
was
a
touch
of
irony
in
his
gaze
at
the
same
time
he
did
not
clearly
understand
de
loubersac
last
phrase
the
excellent
monsieur
de
naarboveck
murmured
in
his
ear
de
loubersac
you
know
has
to
do
with
the
second
bureau
at
the
ministry
of
war
the
statistics
it
was
only
at
half
past
eleven
that
fandor
had
been
able
to
tear
himself
away
from
the
de
naarboveck
house
fandor
wandered
on
the
boulevards
a
long
time
before
he
returned
to
his
flat
on
his
table
near
his
portmanteau
ready
strapped
for
departure
he
found
the
railway
guide
lying
open
at
the
page
showing
the
lines
from
paris
to
the
côte
he
would
not
look
at
the
seductive
he
rushed
to
his
portmanteau
undid
the
straps
in
furious
haste
dragged
out
his
clothes
which
he
flung
to
the
four
quarters
of
the
room
for
the
moment
he
was
in
a
towering
rage
and
now
confound
it
that
brocq
affair
is
not
clear
it
no
use
my
trying
to
persuade
myself
to
the
contrary
there
is
some
mystery
about
it
those
officers
this
diplomat
and
then
this
questionable
person
neither
servant
nor
lady
accustomed
to
good
society
who
has
to
me
all
the
appearance
of
playing
not
merely
a
double
rôle
but
at
the
least
a
triple
perhaps
a
quadruple
good
old
fandor
nothing
for
it
if
you
want
to
go
south
but
to
see
friend
juve
and
get
some
light
on
it
all
having
come
to
this
conclusion
fandor
went
to
bed
he
could
not
sleep
there
was
one
word
which
ceaselessly
formed
itself
in
luminous
letters
before
his
mind
eye
a
word
he
dare
not
articulate
it
was
a
synthetic
word
which
brought
into
a
collected
whole
facts
and
ideas
it
was
the
summing
up
of
his
presentiments
of
his
conclusions
of
his
fears
the
word
which
said
all
without
defining
anything
but
permitted
everything
to
be
inferred
that
word
was
v
they
are
not
agreed
as
one
who
had
the
privilege
of
free
entry
to
the
house
fandor
opened
the
front
door
of
juve
flat
with
the
latchkey
he
possessed
as
a
special
favour
traversed
the
of
the
corridor
and
went
towards
his
friend
study
he
raised
the
curtain
opened
the
door
and
caught
sight
of
juve
at
his
desk
do
disturb
yourself
it
is
only
fandor
the
detective
was
absorbed
in
the
letter
he
was
writing
to
such
a
degree
that
he
had
never
even
heard
the
journalist
enter
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
juve
started
what
you
i
thought
you
had
flown
yesterday
flown
south
fandor
smiled
a
woeful
smile
i
did
expect
to
get
away
yesterday
evening
juve
in
my
calling
as
in
yours
it
is
the
height
of
stupidity
to
make
plans
you
see
here
i
am
still
stuck
here
juve
nodded
assent
well
what
then
he
asked
well
what
do
you
think
juve
the
detective
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
considered
his
young
friend
well
my
dear
fandor
to
what
do
i
owe
the
pleasure
of
this
visit
fandor
did
not
seem
much
disposed
to
answer
he
had
taken
off
his
hat
and
overcoat
now
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
he
selected
one
and
lighted
it
carefully
seeming
to
find
a
veritable
delight
in
the
first
whiffs
which
he
sent
towards
the
ceiling
it
a
fine
day
juve
the
detective
more
and
more
astonished
considered
the
journalist
with
the
utmost
attention
what
the
matter
with
you
fandor
he
said
at
last
why
are
you
carrying
on
like
this
why
are
you
not
on
your
travels
without
being
inquisitive
i
suppose
you
have
your
head
full
of
other
things
than
the
state
of
the
weather
and
you
juve
how
i
juve
i
ask
you
why
you
are
so
upset
the
detective
folded
his
arms
my
word
fandor
but
you
are
losing
your
head
you
think
then
that
i
am
thoroughly
upset
juve
you
look
like
a
really
juve
you
have
not
been
to
bed
i
have
not
been
to
bed
have
i
not
how
do
you
know
that
fandor
approached
the
and
pointed
to
the
corner
where
a
series
of
cigarettes
were
ranged
side
by
side
ah
i
do
not
doubt
juve
but
that
they
tidy
up
your
study
every
morning
but
here
are
cigarette
ends
lying
side
by
side
you
certainly
have
not
smoked
all
those
in
one
morning
consequently
you
have
lighted
them
during
the
night
and
consequently
you
have
not
gone
to
bed
juve
tone
was
bantering
continue
little
one
you
interest
me
and
to
cap
it
all
the
ends
of
your
cigarettes
have
been
chewed
bitten
mangled
an
indisputable
sign
of
high
nervous
tension
therefore
fandor
therefore
juve
i
ask
what
is
wrong
with
you
that
all
the
detective
fixed
the
journalist
with
a
piercing
look
trying
to
guess
what
he
was
aiming
at
but
fandor
was
too
good
a
pupil
of
juve
to
let
him
have
the
slightest
inkling
of
his
feelings
there
was
an
enigmatic
smile
on
his
lips
whilst
he
awaited
juve
reply
the
detective
quickly
decided
to
speak
out
i
am
looking
into
a
very
serious
affair
which
interests
me
greatly
grave
possibly
this
did
not
satisfy
fandor
he
seated
himself
on
the
corner
of
the
and
considered
his
friend
see
now
juve
answer
me
if
you
can
see
your
way
to
it
your
attitude
makes
me
sure
that
important
things
are
in
the
air
you
are
in
a
very
emotional
condition
and
that
for
some
reason
i
have
not
fathomed
can
i
be
useful
to
you
will
you
not
let
me
share
this
secret
will
you
tell
me
yours
in
three
minutes
juve
sat
for
a
few
minutes
deep
in
thought
then
in
a
changed
voice
a
solemn
voice
with
a
sharp
note
in
it
he
said
you
know
about
captain
brocq
sudden
death
of
course
let
me
tell
you
that
i
have
discovered
it
was
an
assassination
it
this
affair
i
am
giving
all
my
attention
to
when
there
was
mention
of
the
brocq
affair
fandor
started
here
was
a
strange
coincidence
since
last
night
had
not
his
own
mind
been
distressed
by
the
mysteries
he
divined
in
this
strange
death
and
now
here
was
juve
also
upset
by
his
examination
of
this
same
affair
fandor
drew
up
a
chair
placed
himself
astride
it
facing
juve
putting
his
elbows
on
the
back
and
holding
his
head
between
his
hands
you
are
looking
into
this
brocq
affair
juve
very
well
so
am
i
you
have
read
my
articles
they
are
very
interesting
they
lack
conclusiveness
however
but
as
things
are
i
could
not
do
better
not
having
any
precise
information
and
facts
to
go
upon
are
you
quite
certain
about
the
facts
yourself
do
you
know
who
has
struck
the
blow
do
you
suspect
fandor
juve
did
not
give
him
time
to
reply
he
half
rose
from
his
seat
and
bending
close
to
fandor
looked
him
straight
in
the
eyes
tell
me
my
boy
suppose
that
after
six
months
of
truce
six
months
of
tranquillity
your
whole
existence
is
again
violently
upset
if
you
understood
that
the
efforts
and
dangers
and
struggles
and
tenacity
of
six
long
years
were
entirely
wasted
and
that
the
results
you
thought
you
had
achieved
did
not
exist
that
you
had
to
begin
all
over
again
that
once
more
you
had
to
play
a
match
with
not
only
your
life
for
stakes
but
your
honour
as
well
tell
me
fandor
would
you
not
be
stirred
to
your
depths
our
journalist
feigned
indifference
it
was
the
best
way
to
draw
juve
on
he
well
knew
what
do
you
mean
juve
what
do
i
mean
my
boy
you
shall
hear
do
you
know
who
killed
captain
brocq
no
who
fantômas
at
this
sinister
name
fandor
jumped
up
as
though
thunderstruck
fantômas
you
accuse
fantômas
of
having
killed
captain
brocq
juve
nodded
assent
the
two
men
stared
at
each
other
in
silence
fantômas
what
a
flood
of
memories
horrid
menacing
that
name
evoked
there
flashed
through
fandor
mind
all
that
he
knew
of
the
atrocities
which
could
be
imputed
to
fantômas
he
seemed
to
live
over
again
the
recent
years
of
continual
struggle
of
almost
daily
contest
with
the
mysterious
criminal
fantômas
but
had
not
juve
declared
and
not
so
long
ago
after
the
drama
of
rue
norvins
when
the
elusive
monster
had
been
driven
to
flight
had
not
juve
declared
that
fantômas
had
vanished
for
good
and
all
now
at
this
precise
moment
he
was
accusing
this
criminal
of
a
fresh
crime
fandor
thought
too
of
the
conclusions
he
had
himself
arrived
at
whilst
studying
the
brocq
affair
from
his
own
point
of
view
that
it
was
a
drama
of
spies
and
spying
surely
either
he
was
mistaken
or
juve
was
was
it
a
murder
or
a
political
assassination
no
longer
pretending
indifference
he
questioned
juve
anxiously
footnote
see
exploits
of
vol
ii
you
accuse
fantômas
in
the
name
of
death
and
destruction
why
juve
had
regained
his
by
pronouncing
the
word
fantômas
by
giving
utterance
to
his
secret
fears
he
had
relieved
his
feelings
fandor
said
he
in
a
quiet
voice
consider
carefully
all
the
details
and
circumstances
of
this
drama
in
open
day
on
one
of
the
most
frequented
promenades
of
paris
an
officer
falls
mortally
wounded
when
passing
in
a
taxicab
going
possibly
to
some
appointed
in
one
of
the
restaurants
of
the
bois
his
taxi
is
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
vehicles
and
without
having
time
even
to
see
his
attacker
without
anyone
having
seen
him
brocq
collapses
mortally
wounded
killed
as
though
in
battle
by
a
shot
a
mysterious
shot
fired
from
a
weapon
of
the
most
perfect
kind
come
now
fandor
is
that
not
a
crime
worthy
of
fantômas
but
the
journalist
was
not
convinced
true
this
crime
is
worthy
of
fantômas
but
i
do
not
think
fantômas
has
committed
it
you
go
too
far
juve
you
are
the
victim
of
your
hobby
believe
me
you
exaggerate
you
can
not
trace
every
strange
and
subtle
crime
to
this
criminal
if
you
do
not
attribute
this
crime
to
fantômas
then
at
whose
door
do
you
lay
it
demanded
the
detective
who
was
well
aware
that
he
must
guard
against
being
the
victim
of
a
fantômas
obsession
juve
replied
fandor
i
have
been
charged
by
dupont
to
look
into
the
brocq
affair
and
have
had
to
postpone
my
holiday
to
do
it
that
is
how
you
see
me
this
morning
well
i
have
begun
my
enquiry
and
am
trying
to
find
out
the
exact
truth
regarding
this
unfortunate
officer
death
i
have
visited
certain
of
his
relations
interviewed
the
people
who
have
known
him
i
have
been
able
to
get
into
touch
with
this
bobinette
who
seems
to
be
the
last
person
who
approached
him
a
little
before
his
assassination
and
i
have
also
arrived
at
a
conclusion
and
that
is
fandor
a
conclusion
juve
which
does
not
involve
fantômas
in
the
slightest
degree
a
conclusion
which
i
assure
you
has
the
advantage
of
being
more
certain
plainer
more
absolutely
definite
than
and
that
is
fandor
juve
this
officer
belonged
to
the
second
bureau
of
the
staff
officer
yes
and
juve
when
an
officer
of
the
second
bureau
disappears
in
such
tragic
conditions
do
you
know
what
one
presumes
to
be
the
reason
of
that
disappearance
what
juve
i
assert
that
if
captain
brocq
is
dead
it
is
because
there
is
a
spy
in
the
pay
of
a
foreign
power
who
being
under
supervision
perhaps
on
the
point
of
being
arrested
has
resolved
that
the
captain
must
die
in
order
to
save
himself
a
document
has
been
stolen
and
it
is
precisely
this
fact
which
makes
me
disbelieve
in
the
intervention
of
you
do
not
believe
me
juve
the
detective
shrugged
his
shoulders
no
i
do
not
think
you
are
right
in
the
first
place
fantômas
is
capable
of
everything
capable
of
the
theft
of
a
document
for
which
a
foreign
power
would
pay
him
very
highly
just
as
there
is
no
other
kind
of
theft
he
is
not
capable
of
and
then
dear
boy
a
spy
a
traitor
in
the
pay
of
a
foreign
power
would
not
dare
to
attempt
the
crime
to
which
we
are
giving
all
our
attention
not
in
that
particular
way
at
any
rate
there
is
only
one
person
who
would
risk
that
fantômas
fandor
laugh
had
a
note
of
mockery
in
it
he
let
juve
see
that
he
thought
his
ideas
on
this
subject
were
very
simple
indeed
it
is
your
hobby
which
always
inspires
you
he
repeated
beyond
question
i
am
the
first
to
believe
in
the
audacity
of
fantômas
and
if
i
do
not
know
all
the
secrets
of
terror
hidden
in
this
word
i
am
ready
enough
to
be
convinced
but
look
here
juve
i
know
the
world
of
spies
i
have
studied
them
i
know
what
they
are
capable
of
attempting
and
i
do
not
speak
lightly
when
i
tell
you
that
the
assassination
of
brocq
is
a
political
crime
juve
continued
to
shake
his
head
quite
unconvinced
fandor
continued
juve
believe
me
who
says
says
of
anything
the
officers
of
the
second
bureau
are
in
short
the
true
directors
of
the
police
spy
system
they
know
all
the
shameful
mysteries
whereby
some
individual
reputed
honest
honourable
in
appearance
is
in
the
pay
of
the
foreigner
they
know
the
traitors
they
know
who
sells
france
and
who
buys
france
every
day
they
are
in
relation
with
the
agents
belonging
to
all
classes
of
society
lawyers
commercial
men
small
shopkeepers
commercial
travellers
railway
servants
women
of
the
world
women
of
the
pavement
thousands
of
individuals
who
continually
travel
about
the
country
holding
it
in
a
network
of
observations
notes
remarks
the
result
of
all
of
which
might
be
that
some
one
power
would
have
immediately
the
advantage
over
some
other
because
it
knew
the
weak
points
where
it
could
launch
its
attack
you
know
juve
that
they
are
people
who
do
not
shrink
from
anything
when
their
interest
is
at
stake
you
know
that
the
man
who
betrays
who
spies
who
is
an
informer
is
always
disavowed
by
the
country
who
employs
him
you
know
that
those
who
are
taken
in
the
act
are
punished
to
the
utmost
consequently
they
will
stick
at
nothing
to
save
themselves
from
being
caught
do
you
not
think
that
in
this
there
might
be
found
a
man
who
driven
into
a
corner
by
circumstances
would
be
daring
enough
to
commit
the
crime
which
is
occupying
our
attention
now
you
say
is
a
crime
worthy
of
fantômas
agreed
but
i
reply
to
you
must
be
spies
worthy
of
being
compared
to
fantômas
fandor
stopped
short
suddenly
juve
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
the
detective
laughed
aloud
a
burst
of
ironic
laughter
my
dear
boy
said
he
do
not
be
angry
with
me
what
nonsense
juve
you
know
very
well
that
i
would
not
be
that
well
my
dear
fandor
you
see
in
the
assassination
of
captain
brocq
an
affair
of
spying
because
you
have
had
your
hobby
for
some
time
past
the
hobby
of
spying
fandor
smiled
juve
continued
come
is
it
not
true
that
six
months
ago
it
was
just
after
the
dollon
assassination
you
published
in
a
whole
series
of
papers
relating
to
affairs
of
treason
true
is
it
correct
that
you
learned
just
then
that
one
could
define
the
second
bureau
as
the
world
of
spies
and
that
you
were
extremely
struck
by
this
extremely
surprised
that
is
so
juve
it
is
precisely
because
i
had
this
information
and
was
able
to
get
a
fair
knowledge
of
the
terrible
secrets
existing
in
this
dark
government
department
that
i
am
in
a
position
now
to
ascribe
the
brocq
affair
to
the
action
of
some
group
of
spies
your
hobby
again
fandor
the
assassination
of
the
captain
has
occurred
under
such
circumstances
that
it
can
only
be
imputed
to
fantômas
let
us
look
the
truth
in
the
face
we
are
going
to
enter
into
a
fresh
struggle
with
fantômas
that
is
a
certainty
it
your
hobby
now
juve
there
no
fantômas
in
this
affair
no
we
are
face
to
face
with
a
very
serious
business
there
i
agree
with
you
but
it
is
wholly
a
spy
job
nothing
else
getting
up
the
journalist
added
this
very
evening
i
shall
publish
in
an
article
in
which
i
shall
explain
exactly
what
spies
are
the
real
part
they
play
in
the
body
politic
their
terrible
power
that
it
is
a
mistake
to
consider
them
only
cowards
that
owing
to
the
exigencies
of
their
sinister
profession
they
very
often
give
proof
of
an
exceptional
courage
bravery
and
in
which
i
with
a
shrug
juve
interrupted
in
which
you
will
write
nonsense
old
boy
anyhow
you
are
free
that
true
free
to
spend
a
fortnight
in
the
sunny
south
where
i
shall
be
in
a
few
hours
time
anyhow
read
my
article
in
i
tell
you
i
am
going
to
take
a
lot
of
trouble
over
it
a
fortnight
hence
then
juve
he
added
in
a
bantering
tone
do
dream
too
much
of
fantômas
what
vi
corporal
vinson
with
one
knee
resting
on
his
portmanteau
jérôme
fandor
was
pulling
with
all
the
force
of
his
powerful
arms
at
the
straps
in
order
to
buckle
them
up
it
was
sunday
november
the
thirteenth
and
five
in
the
afternoon
the
flat
was
brilliantly
illuminated
and
the
greatest
disorder
reigned
throughout
at
last
fandor
was
off
for
his
holiday
not
to
risk
losing
his
train
our
journalist
meant
to
dine
at
the
lyons
railway
station
ouf
cried
he
when
he
had
succeeded
in
cramming
his
mass
of
garments
sufficiently
tight
and
had
then
closed
the
portmanteau
fandor
uttered
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
this
time
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
his
departure
the
thing
was
certain
he
was
casting
a
final
glance
round
when
he
stopped
short
in
the
middle
of
the
passage
the
had
been
rung
evidently
someone
was
at
the
entrance
door
who
was
it
what
was
it
had
something
arisen
which
was
going
to
prevent
his
departure
he
went
quickly
to
the
door
he
opened
it
to
find
a
soldier
on
the
landing
monsieur
fandor
he
enquired
in
a
gentle
rather
husky
voice
yes
what
is
it
you
want
replied
the
journalist
crossly
the
soldier
came
forward
a
step
then
as
if
making
an
effort
he
articulated
painfully
will
you
permit
me
to
enter
i
am
most
anxious
to
speak
to
you
fandor
with
a
movement
of
the
hand
signified
that
the
importunate
stranger
might
come
inside
he
observed
the
man
closely
he
was
quite
young
and
wore
infantry
uniform
his
stripes
were
those
of
a
corporal
his
hair
was
brown
and
his
light
eyes
were
in
marked
contrast
to
the
much
darker
tones
of
his
face
a
slight
moustache
shaded
his
lip
the
corporal
followed
fandor
into
his
study
and
stood
still
with
an
embarrassed
air
the
journalist
considered
him
an
instant
then
asked
to
whom
have
i
the
honour
of
speaking
this
question
appeared
to
tear
the
soldier
from
a
kind
of
dream
he
jumped
then
mechanically
stood
at
attention
as
if
before
a
superior
officer
i
am
corporal
vinson
fandor
nodded
tried
to
remember
him
but
in
vain
the
name
told
him
nothing
i
have
not
the
honour
to
be
known
to
you
monsieur
but
i
know
you
very
well
through
your
articles
then
he
continued
in
almost
a
supplicating
tone
i
greatly
need
speech
with
you
another
bore
said
fandor
to
himself
who
wants
to
get
me
to
give
him
a
recommendation
of
some
sort
our
journalist
boiled
with
impatience
at
the
thought
of
the
precious
minutes
he
was
losing
he
would
have
to
cut
his
dinner
short
if
he
did
not
wish
to
miss
the
night
express
nevertheless
wishing
to
lessen
the
unpleasant
reception
he
had
given
this
unwelcome
visitor
he
murmured
in
a
tone
which
was
cold
all
the
same
pray
be
seated
monsieur
i
am
listening
to
you
corporal
vinson
seemed
greatly
agitated
the
invitation
was
evidently
very
opportune
for
the
visitor
let
himself
fall
heavily
into
an
great
drops
of
perspiration
were
on
his
forehead
his
lips
were
pallid
at
intervals
he
looked
at
the
journalist
whose
impassible
countenance
did
not
seem
to
invite
confidences
the
poor
trooper
lost
countenance
more
and
more
fandor
remained
silent
at
last
vinson
managed
to
say
in
a
voice
strangling
with
emotion
ah
monsieur
excuse
me
for
having
come
to
disturb
you
like
this
but
i
was
determined
to
tell
you
to
know
you
to
express
to
you
how
i
appreciate
your
talent
your
way
of
writing
how
i
like
the
ideas
you
express
in
your
paper
there
was
your
last
article
so
just
so
charitable
you
are
very
kind
monsieur
interrupted
fandor
and
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
but
if
it
is
the
same
to
you
we
might
arrange
a
meeting
for
another
day
because
now
i
am
very
pressed
for
fandor
made
as
if
to
rise
to
emphasise
his
statement
but
corporal
vinson
far
from
imitating
the
movement
sank
deeper
and
deeper
in
the
large
into
which
he
had
literally
fallen
a
few
minutes
before
and
with
an
accent
of
profound
anguish
for
he
understood
fandor
desire
to
shorten
the
conversation
he
cried
with
a
groan
ah
monsieur
do
not
send
me
away
if
i
keep
silence
now
i
shall
never
have
the
courage
to
speak
but
i
the
soldier
countenance
was
so
full
of
alarm
that
fandor
regretted
his
first
movement
of
his
show
of
impatience
perhaps
this
man
had
interesting
things
to
say
he
must
give
the
fellow
confidence
fandor
smiled
very
well
he
suggested
amiably
let
us
have
a
talk
if
you
really
wish
corporal
vinson
considered
fandor
a
moment
thanking
him
with
a
look
for
his
more
cordial
attitude
then
suddenly
drawing
himself
up
into
a
standing
position
he
shouted
monsieur
fandor
i
am
a
traitor
though
far
from
expecting
so
brutal
a
declaration
fandor
sat
tight
he
well
knew
that
in
such
circumstances
comments
are
useless
he
rose
slowly
approached
the
soldier
and
placing
his
hands
on
the
agitated
man
shoulders
pushed
him
back
into
the
control
yourself
monsieur
i
beg
of
you
he
said
in
a
kind
voice
you
must
not
upset
yourself
like
this
be
calm
great
tears
flowed
down
the
corporal
sunburnt
cheeks
and
fandor
considered
him
not
knowing
how
to
console
so
great
so
spontaneous
a
grief
amidst
his
despair
corporal
vinson
stammered
out
yes
monsieur
it
because
of
a
woman
you
will
understand
you
who
write
articles
in
which
you
say
that
there
should
be
pity
for
such
unfortunates
as
i
am
for
one
is
a
miserable
wretch
when
a
woman
has
you
in
her
clutches
and
you
have
no
money
and
then
with
that
sort
once
you
have
started
getting
mixed
up
in
their
affairs
you
are
jolly
well
caught
you
have
to
do
as
you
are
told
and
always
they
ask
more
and
more
of
you
ah
monsieur
the
death
of
captain
brocq
is
a
frightful
disaster
as
for
me
if
i
have
turned
traitor
it
is
their
the
corporal
murmured
some
unintelligible
words
pronouncing
names
unknown
to
fandor
but
our
journalist
was
rejoicing
more
and
more
at
this
outpouring
suddenly
he
got
the
impression
that
the
mysterious
happenings
the
obscure
drama
he
had
been
on
the
fringe
of
for
some
days
past
was
becoming
clear
that
the
veil
of
ignorance
was
being
torn
away
fandor
had
the
sensation
of
being
a
spectator
before
whose
eyes
a
curtain
was
slowly
rising
which
until
then
had
concealed
the
scenery
of
the
play
the
corporal
continued
stammeringly
ah
monsieur
you
do
not
know
what
it
is
to
have
for
your
mistress
such
a
woman
as
she
whom
i
love
such
a
woman
as
nichoune
nichoune
ah
all
châlons
knows
what
she
is
like
her
wickedness
is
well
known
but
for
all
that
there
is
not
a
man
fandor
interrupted
but
my
good
corporal
why
are
you
telling
me
all
this
why
monsieur
replied
vinson
after
a
pause
and
a
piteous
look
because
it
because
i
have
sworn
to
tell
you
everything
before
i
die
hang
it
all
what
do
you
mean
to
do
asked
fandor
the
corporal
replied
simply
but
his
tone
was
decisive
i
mean
to
kill
myself
from
this
moment
it
was
fandor
who
far
from
wishing
to
start
off
for
his
train
he
had
given
up
any
idea
of
leaving
for
the
south
that
evening
was
bent
on
getting
from
the
soldier
further
details
about
his
life
fandor
now
learned
that
the
corporal
had
been
in
the
service
some
fifteen
months
he
had
been
among
the
first
conscripts
affected
by
the
new
law
of
two
years
compulsory
service
and
had
been
sent
to
the
of
the
line
in
garrison
at
châlons
owing
to
his
qualities
he
had
been
much
appreciated
by
all
his
superior
officers
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
his
classes
he
obtained
his
corporal
stripes
and
in
consideration
of
his
very
good
handwriting
and
also
owing
to
the
influence
of
a
commandant
he
got
a
snug
post
as
secretary
in
the
offices
of
the
fortress
itself
vinson
was
thoroughly
satisfied
with
his
new
situation
for
having
been
brought
up
in
his
mother
petticoats
and
practically
the
whole
of
his
adolescence
having
been
passed
behind
the
counter
of
the
maternal
he
had
much
more
the
temperament
of
a
clerk
than
of
an
active
man
the
only
sport
which
he
enjoyed
was
riding
riding
a
bicycle
and
the
only
luxury
he
allowed
himself
was
photography
time
passed
then
one
sunday
evening
he
went
with
some
comrades
to
a
châlons
vinson
chief
companions
were
some
officers
a
little
better
off
than
he
was
without
being
lavish
in
their
expenditure
these
young
fellows
did
not
reckon
up
their
every
penny
and
not
wishing
to
be
behindhand
vinson
had
sent
to
his
mother
for
money
again
and
again
and
she
had
kept
him
in
funds
on
this
particular
evening
after
the
concert
they
had
invited
some
of
the
performers
to
supper
in
a
private
room
and
vinson
in
the
course
of
the
entertainment
was
attracted
fascinated
by
a
tall
girl
with
dyed
hair
emaciated
cheeks
and
brilliant
eyes
whose
flashy
manners
smacking
of
some
low
suburb
had
subjugated
him
completely
vinson
made
an
impression
on
the
singer
for
she
did
not
respond
to
the
advances
of
a
swaggering
sergeant
reputed
generous
but
turned
her
attentions
to
the
modest
corporal
they
talked
and
they
discovered
they
were
affinities
the
result
was
they
found
themselves
at
daybreak
on
the
deserted
boulevard
of
châlons
the
corporal
leave
did
not
expire
till
the
evening
of
the
following
day
nichoune
offered
him
hospitality
they
became
lovers
vinson
heart
was
in
this
liaison
he
persuaded
himself
that
the
chain
that
bound
them
was
indissoluble
the
singer
idea
was
to
profit
by
it
her
demands
for
money
were
constant
she
harried
her
lover
for
money
little
by
little
vinson
mother
cut
off
supplies
the
corporal
incapable
of
breaking
with
nichoune
ran
up
debts
in
the
town
but
went
on
vinson
this
is
only
the
beginning
i
have
told
you
this
monsieur
with
the
hope
of
excusing
myself
to
a
certain
extent
for
what
i
did
later
on
my
actions
were
the
outcome
and
consequences
of
my
difficulties
something
serious
questioned
fandor
you
shall
judge
of
that
monsieur
vinson
went
on
with
his
confession
in
a
firmer
tone
fandor
realised
that
the
corporal
had
decided
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
it
sometimes
happened
after
i
had
had
a
scene
with
nichoune
and
had
quitted
her
in
a
fury
that
i
would
go
for
a
long
bicycle
ride
into
the
country
taking
my
shame
and
rage
with
me
on
a
certain
saturday
bestriding
my
faithful
bike
i
went
for
a
spin
along
the
dusty
which
runs
past
the
camp
after
going
at
high
speed
i
dismounted
seated
myself
under
a
tree
in
the
shade
by
the
side
of
a
ditch
and
was
falling
asleep
it
was
summer
the
sun
was
pouring
down
a
cyclist
stopped
in
front
of
me
with
a
punctured
tyre
he
asked
me
to
lend
him
the
wherewithal
to
repair
it
and
whilst
the
solution
was
drying
we
started
talking
this
individual
was
about
thirty
elegantly
dressed
and
from
the
way
he
expressed
himself
one
could
see
that
he
was
a
man
accustomed
to
good
society
he
told
me
he
was
making
a
tour
and
was
now
doing
the
neighbourhood
about
reims
and
châlons
very
picturesque
country
i
remarked
but
he
retorted
is
interesting
the
roads
for
example
are
complicated
i
began
to
laugh
at
this
and
as
he
insisted
on
the
difficulty
he
had
to
find
his
way
in
these
parts
i
offered
to
let
him
look
at
my
map
i
carried
a
copy
in
my
blazer
ah
monsieur
how
well
alfred
played
his
little
comedy
that
is
what
he
called
himself
at
least
that
was
the
name
he
was
known
by
the
only
name
i
have
ever
known
he
seemed
absolutely
stupefied
at
the
sight
of
this
map
ordinary
though
as
it
was
and
seemed
set
on
buying
it
from
me
i
did
not
want
to
part
with
it
he
offered
five
francs
for
it
i
expressed
my
astonishment
that
he
would
not
wait
till
he
got
to
châlons
where
he
could
procure
one
like
it
for
the
sum
of
twenty
sous
declared
alfred
gives
me
pleasure
to
pay
you
that
sum
it
is
a
way
of
thanking
you
for
having
lent
me
the
use
of
your
cycle
outfit
my
faith
monsieur
fandor
i
was
too
beggared
to
say
so
i
accepted
the
money
while
making
excuses
for
myself
my
plea
being
that
a
soldier
is
not
a
rich
man
i
pass
over
details
it
is
sufficient
to
say
that
when
we
returned
to
châlons
together
we
were
such
good
friends
that
he
asked
me
to
dine
with
him
when
he
saw
me
back
to
barracks
alfred
pressed
a
loan
on
me
i
had
told
him
about
nichoune
and
about
the
pecuniary
difficulties
i
was
in
for
by
this
time
i
had
full
confidence
in
him
he
slipped
a
piece
into
my
hand
with
an
air
of
authority
you
become
a
civilian
again
said
he
will
easily
be
able
to
pay
me
back
and
besides
to
salve
your
pride
i
am
going
to
ask
you
shortly
to
do
me
a
few
services
i
often
have
little
things
done
i
shall
entrust
the
doing
of
them
to
you
and
shall
pay
you
you
understand
monsieur
fandor
that
there
was
no
reason
for
refusing
that
i
could
see
especially
as
he
made
the
offer
very
nicely
and
that
it
came
in
the
nick
of
time
at
the
very
moment
when
i
have
to
admit
it
i
would
have
done
anything
for
money
after
this
we
met
frequently
alfred
used
to
send
me
invitations
and
often
he
included
nichoune
he
never
would
let
me
pay
for
anything
and
i
must
confess
that
the
greater
part
of
the
time
i
should
have
found
it
very
difficult
indeed
to
pay
a
sou
we
always
met
at
some
appointed
place
outside
the
town
he
would
not
stay
in
châlons
longer
than
he
could
help
because
he
said
the
air
there
was
bad
for
his
delicate
lungs
he
was
particularly
interested
in
aviation
and
he
was
for
ever
getting
me
to
pilot
him
about
the
aviation
camp
who
draw
so
well
he
would
say
me
a
plan
of
this
apparatus
explain
to
me
how
these
huts
are
constructed
he
would
question
me
as
to
the
effectives
of
the
regiments
ask
me
details
as
to
estimates
statements
and
returns
which
passed
through
my
hands
in
the
offices
finally
one
day
as
i
had
no
inkling
of
what
he
was
really
aiming
at
alfred
put
me
on
to
it
the
corporal
stopped
his
throat
was
strained
and
dry
fandor
brought
him
a
glass
of
water
which
he
swallowed
at
a
gulp
with
a
grateful
look
he
continued
said
alfred
to
me
have
confidence
in
you
and
you
know
how
discreet
i
am
very
well
i
have
a
superb
piece
of
business
in
hand
which
ought
to
bring
us
in
a
great
deal
of
money
a
stranger
with
whom
i
came
into
contact
recently
who
is
a
very
good
fellow
who
has
been
obliged
to
leave
his
country
owing
to
troubles
that
were
brought
on
him
possesses
a
document
a
very
interesting
one
which
would
be
much
valued
at
the
staff
headquarters
of
the
sixth
corps
he
needs
money
and
would
be
willing
to
sell
it
i
tried
to
buy
it
from
him
but
i
have
not
the
necessary
funds
i
was
seeking
a
solution
of
the
difficulty
when
this
stranger
asked
me
to
procure
him
some
photographs
of
the
châlons
barracks
in
exchange
for
which
he
would
give
me
his
document
he
needs
these
photographs
for
postcard
purposes
if
we
could
supply
him
with
them
in
three
days
not
only
will
he
give
us
his
important
paper
but
he
will
pay
twenty
francs
for
each
proof
as
well
ah
monsieur
fandor
this
story
did
not
hang
together
but
i
was
actually
weak
enough
to
believe
it
or
at
least
i
tried
to
make
myself
believe
it
besides
this
proposal
of
alfred
came
just
in
time
i
had
not
a
sou
to
my
name
nichoune
was
making
a
terrible
row
and
i
hardly
dared
venture
into
the
streets
i
had
so
many
creditors
i
tried
to
square
matters
with
my
conscience
telling
myself
that
there
was
nothing
compromising
connected
with
these
photographs
in
fact
views
of
our
barracks
are
to
be
found
in
any
album
on
sale
however
small
later
on
i
learned
that
this
was
a
method
employed
to
decoy
the
guides
to
draw
them
securely
into
their
toils
first
of
all
give
them
very
insignificant
things
to
do
in
order
not
to
frighten
them
and
pay
a
high
price
it
is
afterwards
that
they
fasten
you
up
tight
you
shall
see
fandor
nodded
it
was
nearly
time
to
catch
the
train
but
he
thought
no
more
of
the
côte
he
was
too
interested
in
the
confession
and
felt
that
by
letting
him
speak
he
would
learn
more
he
would
learn
much
he
therefore
encouraged
vinson
to
continue
the
corporal
asked
nothing
better
the
photographs
taken
i
rejoined
alfred
who
had
told
me
to
be
sure
to
get
leave
for
hours
whatever
happened
alfred
dragged
me
to
the
railway
station
he
had
two
tickets
we
went
off
to
nancy
where
said
he
we
should
find
the
purchaser
at
nancy
no
one
whoever
it
was
had
gone
to
a
street
in
one
of
the
suburbs
we
waited
in
a
little
flat
towards
four
in
the
afternoon
alfred
said
to
me
do
let
us
hesitate
any
longer
if
the
stranger
has
not
come
it
is
because
he
is
waiting
for
us
elsewhere
i
know
where
let
us
go
to
meet
him
at
metz
metz
i
cried
we
should
have
to
cross
the
frontier
and
i
have
alfred
interrupted
me
laughing
he
opened
a
press
and
brought
out
civilian
clothes
then
he
took
wigs
from
a
drawer
and
a
false
beard
at
the
end
of
we
were
disguised
an
hour
later
we
were
in
lorraine
we
left
the
train
there
it
was
there
that
for
the
first
time
i
began
to
be
afraid
for
it
seemed
to
me
that
when
leaving
the
station
at
metz
alfred
exchanged
a
quick
glance
with
the
policeman
on
duty
ah
monsieur
fandor
how
i
have
regretted
this
journey
directly
we
were
in
a
foreign
country
alfred
attitude
towards
me
changed
he
was
no
longer
the
friend
he
was
the
master
he
had
got
me
the
rogue
and
jolly
tight
too
are
we
going
i
asked
alfred
chuckled
jove
ca
you
guess
he
replied
we
are
going
to
the
wornerstrasse
to
visit
major
schwartz
of
the
intelligence
department
shall
not
go
i
declared
alfred
look
was
a
menace
will
come
said
he
in
a
low
voice
if
you
refuse
at
the
end
of
five
minutes
the
police
will
have
unmasked
you
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
done
i
knew
this
intelligence
department
already
by
reputation
alfred
had
spoken
to
me
about
it
it
was
a
vast
suite
of
rooms
on
the
first
floor
of
a
house
where
a
number
of
men
in
civilian
clothes
were
at
work
they
all
bore
the
military
stamp
we
had
to
wait
in
a
large
room
filled
with
draughtsmen
and
typewriters
and
on
the
wall
hung
a
map
on
a
huge
scale
of
the
frontier
of
the
vosges
alfred
sent
in
his
name
a
few
minutes
afterwards
we
were
ushered
into
an
office
a
big
man
seated
behind
a
table
heaped
with
bundles
of
papers
scrutinised
us
over
his
spectacles
he
was
bald
and
wore
a
thick
fair
beard
he
examined
the
photographs
without
a
word
threw
them
carelessly
on
a
set
of
shelves
and
took
from
his
drawer
ten
louis
in
french
money
which
he
counted
out
to
me
of
any
document
in
exchange
there
was
of
course
no
question
i
thought
everything
was
finished
and
i
was
preparing
to
leave
this
abominable
place
when
the
big
man
put
his
hand
on
my
arm
it
was
major
schwartz
himself
the
chief
of
the
spy
system
there
i
learned
that
later
he
said
to
me
in
very
correct
french
with
hardly
a
trace
of
accent
to
betray
his
origin
vinson
we
have
paid
you
lavishly
for
information
of
no
value
but
you
will
have
to
serve
us
better
than
that
and
we
shall
continue
to
treat
you
well
i
thought
i
should
have
fainted
when
i
heard
my
name
pronounced
by
this
man
it
was
clear
he
already
knew
my
rank
and
name
he
knew
much
more
than
that
as
the
conversation
which
followed
let
me
see
he
informed
me
that
he
wished
to
obtain
a
complete
statement
of
the
organisation
of
the
dirigibles
and
aeroplanes
he
must
have
the
characteristics
of
all
the
apparatus
a
list
of
the
flying
service
corps
he
exacted
even
more
confidential
information
still
where
the
aviators
and
the
aircraft
were
to
be
moved
if
mobilisation
took
place
the
whole
bag
of
tricks
in
fact
and
asked
fandor
hesitating
a
little
you
have
supplied
him
with
all
this
in
a
voice
so
low
as
to
be
barely
audible
and
blushing
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
vinson
confessed
i
supplied
it
all
is
that
all
you
have
to
say
not
yet
monsieur
listen
alfred
had
gone
back
with
me
as
far
as
nancy
where
i
had
put
on
my
uniform
again
then
i
returned
to
châlons
quite
by
myself
i
asked
myself
if
it
would
be
possible
to
get
clear
away
from
the
terrible
set
i
was
mixed
up
with
try
as
i
might
i
could
not
manage
it
every
day
alfred
harried
me
threatened
me
i
had
to
obey
him
then
almost
on
the
top
of
this
came
the
affair
of
captain
brocq
fandor
had
been
waiting
for
this
he
had
foreseen
that
he
was
going
to
learn
what
the
connecting
link
was
which
united
the
adventures
of
corporal
vinson
with
the
drama
of
the
place
de
but
his
expectations
were
not
fulfilled
true
enough
vinson
through
the
mysterious
intervention
of
his
redoubtful
friends
was
to
enter
into
relations
with
captain
brocq
to
whom
he
had
been
recommended
how
or
in
what
terms
he
did
not
know
the
business
hung
fire
for
several
weeks
and
this
was
owing
to
vinson
himself
whose
moods
alternated
from
one
of
shrinking
disgust
to
one
of
bravado
courage
at
times
said
he
i
wished
to
break
with
them
at
any
cost
and
become
honest
once
more
but
alas
i
was
always
under
the
evil
influence
of
nichoune
who
was
a
very
close
friend
of
alfred
and
the
pair
of
them
encouraged
me
to
tread
the
traitor
path
without
faltering
then
without
breathing
a
word
i
put
in
a
request
through
the
proper
channel
for
a
change
of
garrison
i
hoped
to
get
sent
either
to
the
west
or
the
south
above
all
i
was
bent
on
leaving
the
sixth
corps
on
flying
from
the
frontier
neighbourhood
and
finishing
my
service
in
some
district
or
region
where
it
would
be
impossible
for
them
to
make
me
their
spy
tool
but
i
do
not
know
how
was
it
through
nichoune
i
expect
so
because
i
had
unluckily
confided
this
secret
to
her
one
evening
alfred
got
wind
of
what
i
was
up
to
he
flew
into
a
fearful
rage
suddenly
he
quieted
down
and
began
to
laugh
my
boy
i
am
going
to
play
a
good
joke
on
you
it
was
a
terrible
joke
it
is
that
still
monsieur
listen
to
what
happened
i
got
my
exchange
all
right
it
is
on
that
account
i
have
eight
days
leave
but
next
monday
november
before
midday
i
must
report
to
my
new
regiment
but
this
regiment
the
infantry
is
in
garrison
at
verdun
you
grasp
it
i
begin
to
murmured
fandor
at
verdun
continued
vinson
who
had
risen
and
was
walking
to
and
fro
pressing
his
head
between
his
hands
a
prey
to
an
indescribable
anguish
at
verdun
that
is
to
say
at
the
frontier
itself
that
means
i
shall
be
in
the
thick
of
all
that
lot
at
their
mercy
oh
the
trick
had
been
well
thought
out
carefully
contrived
i
have
got
away
from
the
wasp
nest
only
to
tumble
into
the
middle
of
the
swarm
oh
monsieur
i
am
losing
my
head
absolutely
i
feel
that
they
have
me
tight
that
it
is
impossible
to
get
free
of
them
and
what
is
more
i
am
afraid
of
being
taken
up
yes
these
last
few
days
at
châlons
i
have
been
terrified
i
believe
that
they
suspect
me
that
they
suspect
nichoune
that
my
superiors
have
me
under
supervision
directly
after
the
announcement
of
captain
brocq
assassination
appeared
in
the
papers
all
this
descended
on
me
as
swiftly
as
a
tempest
oh
i
am
lost
lost
i
wished
to
come
and
make
an
open
confession
of
all
my
shame
to
you
that
by
means
of
an
article
in
your
paper
you
may
put
young
soldiers
on
their
guard
those
who
owing
to
a
mad
infatuation
for
some
abominable
women
or
through
need
of
money
should
be
disposed
to
follow
my
wretched
example
some
cursed
day
or
other
yes
my
damnable
example
the
corporal
fell
down
in
the
middle
of
the
room
fell
down
like
a
crumpled
rag
he
sobbed
fandor
pitied
this
miserable
creature
who
had
sunk
so
low
he
raised
him
gently
vinson
he
declared
you
must
not
die
remember
you
have
a
mother
listen
be
brave
summon
your
courage
tell
your
chiefs
everything
everything
the
wretched
man
shook
his
head
never
never
monsieur
i
could
not
do
it
think
monsieur
it
is
the
vilest
of
vile
things
i
have
done
i
a
soldier
of
france
of
france
monsieur
you
spoke
of
my
mother
it
is
because
of
her
i
wish
to
kill
myself
you
must
know
that
she
is
an
alsatian
she
would
go
mad
mad
monsieur
if
she
learned
that
her
son
has
betrayed
france
this
evening
corporal
vinson
will
no
longer
exist
it
will
be
well
finished
with
him
there
was
a
great
silence
fandor
with
his
arms
folded
and
anxious
brow
was
pacing
up
and
down
his
study
seeking
a
solution
of
this
frightful
problem
asking
himself
what
was
to
be
done
he
saw
that
this
miserable
vinson
was
caught
in
the
wheels
of
a
terrible
machine
from
which
it
was
almost
impossible
to
snatch
him
into
safety
nevertheless
his
conscience
revolted
at
the
idea
that
he
should
do
nothing
to
avert
this
wretched
lad
suicide
he
must
stop
vinson
he
must
certainly
save
him
from
himself
at
any
price
save
him
doubly
then
fandor
saw
further
than
this
he
perceived
that
good
may
come
out
of
evil
perhaps
through
vinson
and
his
relations
with
this
nefarious
nest
of
spies
they
would
succeed
in
clearing
up
the
dark
mystery
surrounding
the
death
of
captain
brocq
evidently
all
these
happenings
were
interconnected
with
his
mind
eye
fandor
saw
this
foreign
spy
system
under
the
form
of
an
immense
a
vast
spider
web
could
one
but
lay
hands
on
the
originator
of
the
initial
thread
or
the
himself
then
they
could
strike
at
the
extreme
ends
of
this
evil
tissue
fandor
admonished
vinson
for
a
long
time
our
journalist
was
now
eloquent
now
persuasive
he
heaped
argument
on
argument
he
appealed
to
his
to
duty
when
at
last
he
saw
that
the
young
corporal
hesitated
that
a
faint
gleam
of
hope
appeared
that
a
vague
desire
for
rehabilitation
was
born
in
him
he
stopped
short
and
demanded
abruptly
vinson
are
you
still
bent
on
killing
yourself
the
corporal
communed
with
himself
a
moment
closed
his
eyes
and
without
a
touch
of
insincerity
replied
in
a
steady
voice
yes
i
have
decided
to
do
it
in
that
case
said
fandor
will
you
look
on
the
deed
as
done
and
take
it
that
you
are
no
longer
in
existence
the
corporal
stared
at
fandor
speechless
absolutely
dumbfounded
fandor
made
his
idea
more
definite
from
this
moment
you
do
not
exist
any
more
you
are
nothing
you
are
no
longer
corporal
and
then
but
fandor
must
have
a
definite
promise
is
this
agreed
to
i
agree
swear
it
i
swear
it
very
well
vinson
you
now
belong
to
me
you
are
my
property
my
chattel
i
am
going
to
give
you
my
instructions
and
they
must
be
strictly
obeyed
carried
out
the
miserable
soldier
seemed
crushed
to
the
earth
but
with
a
movement
of
his
head
he
signified
that
he
was
prepared
to
do
whatever
the
journalist
ordered
vii
the
second
bureau
as
early
as
nine
that
morning
there
was
unusual
activity
in
the
second
bureau
of
the
headquarters
staff
the
second
bureau
this
formidable
office
whose
official
designation
of
did
not
deceive
anyone
occupied
premises
in
the
ministry
of
war
modest
as
to
appearance
this
bureau
was
located
on
the
third
floor
of
one
of
the
oldest
buildings
in
the
rue
saint
dominique
the
departments
of
the
second
bureau
impinged
on
a
long
corridor
and
had
taken
possession
of
quite
half
the
floor
in
the
right
wing
of
the
building
anyone
authorised
to
enter
here
would
find
a
fairly
large
outer
room
where
about
a
dozen
secretaries
would
be
working
at
wooden
desks
these
secretaries
are
changed
frequently
so
that
they
may
not
get
to
know
too
much
about
the
work
passing
through
their
hands
though
they
are
seldom
given
anything
of
an
important
confidential
nature
to
deal
with
there
is
a
vast
square
room
adjoining
reserved
for
the
this
immense
apartment
is
abundantly
lighted
by
two
large
windows
and
a
large
table
of
white
wood
stands
in
the
centre
of
the
room
occasionally
it
is
heaped
with
papers
but
generally
it
is
clear
and
only
maps
are
to
be
seen
maps
of
all
parts
of
france
and
of
foreign
countries
also
marked
with
red
pencil
ornamented
with
cabalistic
signs
thickly
sprinkled
with
notes
placed
against
the
walls
are
the
desks
of
the
officers
of
this
department
two
captains
and
two
lieutenants
next
to
this
room
is
the
small
office
where
commandant
dumoulin
the
chief
assistant
is
generally
to
be
found
fixed
into
the
wall
on
the
side
is
the
one
remarkable
thing
in
this
most
ordinary
looking
office
here
is
the
famous
steel
press
of
which
commandant
dumoulin
alone
possesses
the
key
and
in
which
are
enclosed
they
say
the
most
secret
instructions
relating
to
national
defence
and
mobilisation
this
office
communicates
on
one
side
with
the
office
of
statistics
and
on
the
opposite
side
with
a
soberly
furnished
with
and
sofas
covered
with
green
velvet
on
the
walls

a
green
paper

adorns

doors
are
tightly
closed

and

at
the
extreme
end
of
the
corridor
is
the
office
of
the
colonel
hofferman
at
once
elegantly
and
comfortably
furnished
this
office
is
quite
unlike
the
others
there
is
more
of
the
individual
than
the
official
here
an
array
of
telephones
keeps
the
colonel
in
touch
with
the
various
departments
of

with
the
municipality
with
the
governor
of
paris
in
a
recess
is
a
telegraphic
installation
this
able
infantry
officer
is
a
man
of
great
distinction
he
has
directed
the
delicate
service
of
statistics
with
much
tact
and
discretion
for
the
past
three
years
his
fair
complexion
blue
eyes
blonde
hair
betray
his
alsatian
origin
this
handsome
bachelor
verging
on
the
fifties
is
very
much
a
man
of
the
world
is
received
in
the
most
exclusive
sets
and
has
been
known
to
carry
on
the
most
intimate
conversations
with
charming
ladies
in
his
office
was
the
subject
of
these
talks
national
defence
who
knows
in
the
officers
room
there
was
animated
talk
then
it
is
an
artilleryman
again
asked
lieutenant
armandelle
a
regular
colossus
with
a
complexion
who
had
passed
long
years
in
africa
at
the
head
of
a
detachment
of
zouaves
captain
loreuil
was
sharpening
a
pencil
he
stopped
and
throwing
himself
back
in
his
chair
replied
with
a
smile
no
my
dear
fellow
this
time
it
is
to
be
a
sapper
looking
over
his
spectacles
he
softly
hummed
the
old
refrain
of
thérèse
is
as
sacred
to
a
sapper
armandelle
burst
out
laughing
ah
my
boy
come
what
will
you
meet
it
with
a
smile
by
jove
old
man
why
be
gloomy
answered
the
lively
captain
we
can
only
live
once
let
us
make
the
best
use
of
our
time
then
why
not
be
jolly
judging
by
his
looks
captain
loreuil
had
followed
his
own
advice
plump
of
face
stout
of
figure
he
wore
glasses
large
round
glasses
set
in
gold
frames
for
he
was
exceptionally
his
colleagues
had
nicknamed
him
the
lawyer
it
was
easy
to
see
that
he
was
much
more
at
home
in
mufti
than
in
uniform
he
would
say
laughing
i
have
all
the
looks
of
a
territorial
and
that
is
unfortunate
considering
i
belong
to
the
active
contingent
loreuil
was
one
of
the
most
highly
appreciated
officers
of
the
second
bureau
had
anyone
examined
the
hands
of
the
lawyer
just
then
he
would
have
seen
that
they
were
roughened
and
had
horny
lumps
on
them
of
recent
formation
his
fingers
all
twisted
out
of
shape
at
the
tips
seamed
with
scars
led
one
to
suppose
that
the
captain
was
not
entirely
a
man
of
sedentary
office
life
in
fact
he
had
just
returned
after
a
fairly
long
absence
he
had
disappeared
for
six
months
it
was
rumoured
in
the
departments
that
he
had
been
one
of
a
gang
of
masons
who
were
constructing
a
fort
on
a
foreign
frontier
a
fort
the
plans
of
which
he
had
got
down
to
the
smallest
detail
but
questions
had
not
been
asked
and
the
captain
had
not
of
course
given
his
colleagues
the
slightest
hint
the
smallest
indication
of
how
those
six
months
had
been
passed
besides
unforeseen
journeys
sudden
disappearances
unexpected
returns
mysterious
missions
made
up
the
ordinary
lot
of
those
attached
to
the
second
bureau
the
old
keeper
of
the
records
gaudin
who
was
methodically
sorting
a
voluminous
correspondence
which
was
to
be
laid
before
commandant
dumoulin
put
a
question
to
armandelle
lieutenant
is
it
not
a
captain
of
the
engineers
who
is
to
take
the
place
of
this
poor
captain
brocq
true
enough
gaudin
his
nomination
was
signed
by
the
minister
yesterday
we
expect
him
this
morning
at
nine
what
time
is
it
now
a
quarter
past
nine
lieutenant
he
will
be
punctual
why
of
course
cried
captain
loreuil
that
is
why
i
caught
sight
of
the
chief
just
now
he
is
earlier
than
usual
what
is
the
name
of
the
muller
said
armandelle
he
comes
from
belfort
cried
loreuil
i
know
what
hofferman
will
say
to
him
dear
captain
you
enter
this
day
the
house
of
silence
and
discretion
loreuil
turned
to
gaudin
where
is
lieutenant
de
loubersac
this
morning
why
captain
explained
the
old
keeper
of
records
you
must
know
very
well
that
he
has
been
ordered
to
act
as
escort
to
the
king
of
greece
confound
loubersac
he
goes
to
all
the
entertainments
steps
were
heard
some
brief
words
were
spoken
in
the
adjacent
corridor
an
orderly
opened
the
door
and
saluted
captain
muller
has
arrived
monsieur
extended
very
much
at
his
ease
on
a
comfortable
couch
colonel
hofferman
was
polishing
his
nails
whilst
commandant
dumoulin
stood
respectfully
before
him
tightly
encased
in
his
sober
light
infantry
uniform
dumoulin
was
fully
alive
to
the
importance
of
his
position
was
he
not
the
repository
of
the
famous
key
which
unlocked
the
steel
press
the
colonel
looked
up
at
his
subordinate
you
are
going
to
put
captain
muller
in
the
way
of
things
here
commandant
are
you
not
yes
colonel
it
will
be
a
good
thing
to
have
a
talk
with
captain
muller
he
comes
just
at
the
moment
when
we
have
some
very
nasty
business
in
hand
difficult
very
worrying
that
so
dumoulin
true
colonel
that
a
fact
hofferman
pressed
a
bell
an
orderly
appeared
ask
captain
muller
to
kindly
step
in
here
almost
at
once
captain
muller
entered
saluted
and
remained
standing
at
some
distance
from
his
chief
take
this
captain
hofferman
was
amiable
politeness
itself
dumoulin
rather
scandalised
that
the
colonel
should
encourage
such
familiarity
in
a
subordinate
was
on
the
point
of
retiring
discreetly
the
colonel
made
him
sit
down
also
hofferman
turned
to
captain
muller
you
come
amongst
us
monsieur
at
a
sad
moment
you
know
of
course
that
you
are
captain
brocq
successor
a
most
valuable
officer
to
whom
we
were
greatly
attached
captain
muller
bent
his
head
he
murmured
we
were
men
of
the
same
year
comrades
at
the
school
brocq
and
i
hofferman
continued
ah
well
you
are
to
take
on
the
work
begun
by
captain
brocq
now
tell
me
captain
what
importance
do
you
attach
to
the
orders
regarding
the
the
mustering
and
distribution
of
the
mechanics
and
operatives
of
the
artillery
in
the
various
corps
from
the
point
of
view
of
mobilisation
that
is
it
is
of
the
very
greatest
importance
colonel
good
hofferman
paused
he
continued
in
a
low
tone
and
with
a
grave
air
in
the
newspapers
oh
in
ambiguous
terms
but
clear
enough
to
the
initiated
the
public
has
been
given
to
understand
that
not
only
has
an
important
document
been
stolen
from
captain
brocq
before
or
at
the
time
of
his
assassination
or
after
it
but
that
this
document
was
none
other
than
the
distribution
chart
of
the
concealed
works
in
and
about
the
girdle
of
forts
on
the
east
of
paris
this
is
inaccurate
captain
what
has
disappeared
is
the
distribution
list
of
our
artillery
mechanics
that
is
much
more
serious
however
for
some
time
past
we
have
had
under
consideration
a
rearrangement
scheme
we
are
going
to
take
advantage
of
the
disappearance
of
the
document
in
question
document
number
keep
that
number
in
mind
we
are
going
to
draw
up
a
new
plan
for
the
mobilisation
of
the
you
are
to
be
entrusted
with
this
and
i
count
on
your
devoting
your
whole
time
and
attention
to
it
captain
muller
understood
that
the
conversation
was
at
an
end
he
rose
saying
quietly
you
may
count
on
me
colonel
he
was
then
given
his
official
instructions
hofferman
left
the
couch
and
dropping
his
nail
polisher
came
towards
the
captain
with
outstretched
hands
my
father
knew
yours
in
bygone
days
he
cried
genially
both
were
natives
of
colmar
why
is
that
so
indeed
colonel
cried
the
captain
delighted
to
find
himself
among
friends
hofferman
nodded
all
will
go
well
be
sure
of
it
i
know
you
take
your
work
seriously
we
have
excellent
reports
of
you
you
are
married
are
you
not
muller
nodded
in
the
affirmative
excellent
declared
the
colonel
pointing
a
threatening
finger
at
muller
you
know
our
standing
orders
here
many
acquaintances
very
few
intimates
no
mistress
the
colonel
did
not
remain
alone
in
his
office
long
he
sent
for
lieutenant
de
loubersac
with
a
soldier
punctuality
he
appeared
before
his
chief
he
was
in
uniform
nothing
unusual
this
morning
loubersac
questioned
hofferman
gazing
complacently
at
the
soldier
superb
in
his
magnificent
uniform
an
elegant
and
splendid
specimen
of
a
cavalry
officer
nothing
colonel
the
arrival
of
the
king
of
greece
has
been
perfectly
carried
out
the
crowd
oh
indifferent
on
the
whole
come
to
have
a
look
at
him
out
of
curiosity
ah
no
king
of
spain
affair
no
no
out
of
that
i
got
this
scar
on
my
forehead
well
cried
the
colonel
it
an
ill
wind
that
blows
nobody
any
good
you
will
get
the
cross
all
the
quicker
lieutenant
de
loubersac
smiled
hofferman
continued
my
dear
fellow
you
know
the
vanished
document
extremely
important
it
will
have
to
be
found
good
colonel
have
you
just
now
a
particularly
sharp
agent
shrewd
yes
colonel
said
de
loubersac
after
a
moment
reflection
who
is
he
the
man
engaged
on
the
v
affair
when
shall
you
see
him
this
afternoon
colonel
we
have
an
appointment
for
the
worst
of
it
is
this
affair
is
making
no
end
of
talk
scandal
it
the
very
devil
and
all
some
fools
of
papers
who
deal
in
scandal
are
scaring
the
public
with
rumours
of
war
they
speak
of
the
eventual
rupture
of
diplomatic
relations
the
financial
market
is
unsteady
the
jews
are
selling
as
hard
as
they
can
and
that
is
disquieting
for
those
fellows
have
a
quicker
scent
than
any
one
lieutenant
it
is
urgent
set
your
agent
to
work
at
once
he
must
act
with
discretion
of
course
but
he
must
act
as
quickly
as
possible
it
is
urgent
and
what
are
the
conditions
colonel
after
a
moment
reflection
hofferman
replied
you
must
make
and
get
the
best
conditions
you
can
it
was
noon
and
twelve
was
striking
the
vast
ministerial
premises
where
silence
had
reigned
till
then
were
filled
with
murmurs
and
the
sharp
sound
of
voices
there
were
hurrying
footsteps
on
the
stairs
doors
banged
the
offices
were
emptying
for
a
couple
or
hours
ah
ha
cried
captain
loreuil
jamming
an
enormous
soft
hat
down
on
his
head
till
it
all
but
covered
his
eyes
this
gave
him
the
appearance
either
of
an
artist
of
sorts
or
of
a
seller
of
chestnuts
now
behold
the
handsomest
cavalier
of
france
and
navarre
and
he
struck
up
in
a
clear
voice
how
i
would
love
this
i
were
still
a
henri
de
loubersac
who
had
just
collided
with
the
captain
burst
into
laughter
and
warmly
shook
hands
with
him
a
limited
number
of
people
some
curious
others
merely
idle
were
standing
motionless
in
the
zoological
gardens
they
were
lining
the
palisade
which
surrounds
the
rocky
basin
where
half
a
dozen
crocodiles
were
performing
their
evolutions
besides
children
and
nursemaids
and
governesses
there
were
also
creatures
in
rags
some
students
a
workman
or
two
the
inevitable
telegraph
boy
who
was
loitering
on
the
way
instead
of
hastening
onwards
with
the
telegrams
and
noticeably
a
fair
young
man
smart
in
overcoat
and
wearing
a
bowler
hat
he
had
been
standing
there
some
ten
minutes
and
was
giving
but
scant
attention
to
the
saurians
he
was
casting
furtive
glances
around
him
as
though
looking
for
someone
if
he
were
awaiting
the
arrival
of
some
member
of
the
fair
sex
it
hardly
seemed
the
place
for
a
this
melancholy
zoological
gardens
misty
with
the
leaves
falling
gradually
baring
the
trees
at
the
approach
of
winter
a
uniform
suddenly
appeared
in
one
of
the
paths
it
was
a
sergeant
belonging
to
the
commissariat
department
who
was
passing
rapidly
bent
on
business
directly
the
fair
young
man
saw
him
he
left
his
place
by
the
palisade
and
hid
himself
behind
a
tree
muttering
decidedly
one
has
to
be
constantly
on
the
defensive
he
unbuttoned
his
coat
and
looked
at
his
watch
minutes
past
three
he
will
not
be
long
now
two
hundred
yards
from
this
spot
before
the
chief
entrance
to
the
gardens
a
crowd
had
gathered
inveterate
idlers
jostling
one
another
in
the
circle
they
had
formed
round
a
sordid
individual
a
miserable
old
man
with
a
long
white
beard
who
was
drawing
discordant
sounds
from
an
old
accordion
some
kindly
housewives
some
were
exercising
their
lungs
to
the
utmost
trying
to
help
the
musician
to
play
according
to
time
and
tune
but
in
spite
of
the
goodwill
about
him
the
poor
man
could
not
manage
to
play
one
single
bar
correctly
and
his
helpers
bawled
in
vain
at
the
end
of
a
few
minutes
the
accordion
player
gave
up
his
attempts
and
taking
his
soft
and
ancient
hat
in
his
hand
he
put
in
practice
a
much
easier
exercise
he
made
the
round
of
the
company
to
collect
their
offerings
the
crowd
melted
like
magic
leaving
him
solitary
hat
in
hand
and
with
only
a
few
sous
in
it
for
his
pains
with
a
resigned
air
the
man
pocketed
his
meagre
takings
then
pushing
the
accordion
up
on
his
back
where
it
was
held
in
place
by
a
strap
he
walked
bent
staggering
towards
the
gate
he
passed
through
it
and
entered
the
gardens
the
old
man
went
to
a
secluded
seat
behind
the
museum
almost
immediately
he
saw
a
young
man
approaching
the
very
same
who
some
ten
minutes
before
had
been
staring
at
the
crocodiles
with
but
lukewarm
interest
the
young
man
seated
himself
beside
the
old
accordion
player
without
seeming
to
notice
him
then
in
an
almost
inaudible
voice
as
if
speaking
to
himself
the
young
man
uttered
these
words
fine
weather
the
daisy
is
going
to
bloom
at
once
the
accordion
player
added
and
the
potatoes
are
going
to
sprout
they
identified
each
other
the
two
men
were
alone
in
this
deserted
corner
of
the
garden
they
drew
closer
together
and
began
to
converse
are
things
still
going
well
vagualame
my
faith
monsieur
henri
that
the
old
accordion
player
cast
a
rapid
penetrating
glance
at
the
countenance
of
his
companion
it
was
done
with
the
instinctive
ease
of
habit
the
young
man
was
leaning
forward
tracing
circles
in
the
sand
with
his
stick
what
is
the
position
vagualame
he
asked
briefly
i
have
no
more
money
lieutenant
the
young
man
sat
upright
and
looked
at
the
old
man
angrily
what
has
come
to
you
there
is
no
lieutenant
here
i
am
henri
and
nothing
else
do
i
trouble
myself
to
find
out
who
you
are
vagualame
oh
protested
the
old
man
that
enough
do
not
be
afraid
i
understand
my
business
you
know
my
devotion
unfortunately
it
costs
a
great
deal
yes
replied
henri
de
loubersac
for
he
it
was
yes
i
know
you
are
always
hard
up
shall
i
have
money
soon
insisted
vagualame
that
depends
how
are
things
going
which
things
the
lieutenant
showed
impatience
was
vagualame
stupid
silly
manner
intentional
assuredly
that
handsome
fellow
that
dashing
soldier
henri
de
loubersac
knew
nothing
of
this
same
vagualame
relations
with
bobinette
nor
his
attitude
towards
that
mysterious
accomplice
of
his
whom
he
had
just
assassinated
or
pretended
to
have
assassinated
captain
brocq
thus
vagualame
had
two
strings
to
his
bow
serving
at
one
and
the
same
time
the
second
bureau
and
most
probably
its
bitterest
adversaries
vagualame
you
really
are
a
fool
went
on
de
loubersac
what
i
refer
to
is
the
affair
how
does
it
stand
what
has
been
done
the
old
man
began
to
laugh
peuh
nothing
at
all
another
rigmarole
in
which
women
are
mixed
up
you
know
the
little
singer
of
châlons
called
nichoune
she
made
her
first
appearance
at
la
fère
and
since
then
the
creature
has
roved
through
the
rowdy
of
picardy
of
the
ardennes
you
must
know
her
well
monsieur
henri
the
lieutenant
interrupted
him
all
this
does
not
mean
anything
vagualame
pardon
nichoune
is
the
mistress
of
corporal
he
is
on
leave
the
corporal
i
know
he
is
in
paris
well
then
what
do
you
wish
me
to
do
you
must
go
to
châlons
and
make
an
exhaustive
enquiry
into
the
relations
of
v
with
nichoune
was
eaten
up
with
debts
he
has
settled
them
remarked
vagualame
ah
lieutenant
de
loubersac
was
rather
taken
aback
well
find
out
how
and
why
get
me
information
also
about
someone
called
alfred
i
know
him
lieutenant
pardon
monsieur
henri
a
a
we
must
know
exactly
the
nature
of
the
relations
between
corporal
and
the
late
captain
brocq
these
last
words
particularly
interested
vagualame
he
drew
nearer
still
to
de
loubersac
tapping
him
on
the
knee
tell
me
has
anything
new
come
to
light
in
that
affair
henri
de
loubersac
moved
away
and
looked
the
old
accordion
player
up
and
down
do
not
meddle
with
what
does
not
concern
you
good
good
that
all
right
the
old
fellow
pretended
to
be
confused
nevertheless
a
gleam
of
joy
shone
beneath
his
eyelids
there
was
a
moment
silence
henri
de
loubersac
was
gnawing
his
moustache
vagualame
who
was
stealthily
watching
him
said
to
himself
as
for
you
my
fine
fellow
i
am
waiting
for
you
you
have
a
fine
big
morsel
for
me
i
see
what
you
are
driving
at
true
enough
suddenly
between
him
and
the
lieutenant
there
was
an
exchange
of
hurried
words
in
a
low
tone
vagualame
would
you
like
a
highly
paid
commission
yes
monsieur
henri
is
it
difficult
to
earn
naturally
vagualame
insisted
dangerous
as
well
perhaps
how
much
will
you
pay
without
hesitation
the
officer
said
thousand
equally
without
hesitation
but
putting
on
an
offended
air
vagualame
retorted
nothing
doing
thirty
thousand
the
old
man
murmured
what
the
devil
is
it
a
question
of
lowering
his
voice
still
more
de
loubersac
added
it
is
a
lost
document
perhaps
it
is
a
case
of
theft
a
list
of
the
distribution
of
artillery
operatives
document
number
six
but
cried
vagualame
who
feigned
sudden
comprehension
of
this
document
importance
but
that
is
equivalent
to
a
complete
plan
of
mobilisation
exasperated
lieutenant
henri
interrupted
the
old
fellow
i
do
not
ask
for
your
opinion
as
to
its
signification
and
value
can
you
recover
it
vagualame
murmured
some
incomprehensible
words
what
are
you
saying
questioned
de
loubersac
who
growing
more
and
more
exasperated
shook
him
by
the
sleeve
gently
monsieur
henri
gently
if
you
please
whined
the
old
man
i
was
only
thinking
what
is
always
the
case
for
the
woman
the
disappearance
of
the
document
continued
de
loubersac
is
coincident
with
the
death
of
captain
brocq
so
it
is
he
stopped
and
stared
at
vagualame
who
was
rubbing
his
hands
simulating
an
extreme
satisfaction
and
mumbling
with
an
air
of
enjoyment
women
always
the
dear
women
ah
these
dear
and
damnable
women
he
resumed
his
serious
expression
his
manner
was
decided
monsieur
henri
he
declared
i
will
find
it
but
the
price
is
fifty
thousand
francs
what
de
loubersac
was
startled
vagualame
raised
his
hand
as
if
taking
heaven
to
witness
that
his
statement
was
final
not
a
sou
more
not
a
sou
less
fifty
thousand
is
the
price
fifty
thousand
henri
de
loubersac
hesitated
a
second
then
concluded
the
interview
agreed
to
be
quick
about
it
adieu
viii
a
singer
of
the
halls
nichoune
nichoune
nichoune
be
off
with
you
léonce
to
the
door
it
was
a
regular
hubbub
an
uproar
it
increased
léonce
the
comedian
had
to
cut
short
his
monologue
the
little
at
châlons
was
at
its
liveliest
there
was
not
a
single
seat
to
be
had
it
was
a
mixed
audience
of
soldiers
and
civilians
and
the
uniform
did
not
fraternise
too
well
with
the
garb
of
the
this
was
frequented
by
soldiers
who
out
on
leave
would
visit
the
taverns
the
and
finish
the
evening
on
the
squalid
benches
of
this
eldorado
of
the
provinces
on
this
particular
evening
these
critical
gentlemen
of
the
army
were
less
satisfied
than
ever
there
had
been
three
first
appearances
of
poor
quality
and
they
accused
the
management
of
having
filled
the
hall
with
civilians
in
order
to
secure
a
good
reception
for
these
mediocre
performers
hussars
and
cuirassiers
joined
forces
and
made
a
frightful
uproar
take
the
comic
man
away
he
shall
not
sing
then
the
entire
audience
shouted
one
name
demanded
one
performer
only
nichoune
nichoune
nichoune
nichoune
was
indeed
the
star
of
the
company
she
was
rather
pretty
her
face
was
intelligent
and
what
was
rare
enough
in
that
hall
her
tone
was
almost
pure
and
true
and
above
all
she
sang
popular
ditties
so
that
the
audience
could
join
in
the
chorus
as
usual
after
every
singer
male
or
female
there
were
loud
demands
for
nichoune
her
admirers
were
merciless
they
had
no
consideration
for
her
fatigue
they
would
have
kept
her
on
the
platform
from
eight
till
midnight
the
manager
rushed
to
nichoune
come
come
at
once
they
will
smash
up
everything
if
you
do
not
hurry
on
nichoune
got
up
ah
ha
if
i
do
get
a
rise
after
this
well
i
shall
be
off
you
will
see
they
will
have
to
have
me
back
too
the
manager
showed
by
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
that
this
was
a
matter
of
profound
indifference
to
him
come
on
to
the
platform
my
dear
and
be
quick
about
it
nichoune
raced
down
the
stairs
and
appeared
before
the
clamouring
crowd
panting
at
sight
of
her
calm
succeeded
storm
the
idol
was
going
to
sing
nichoune
swaggered
down
the
stage
and
planting
herself
close
to
the
footlights
flung
the
title
of
her
song
at
the
delighted
audience
in
strident
tones
inquiets
music
by
delmet
words
also
it
is
i
who
sing
it
whilst
nichoune
began
her
song
hands
on
hips
she
scrutinised
her
audience
bestowing
little
smiles
on
her
particular
admirers
she
could
not
have
been
in
her
best
form
because
when
about
to
start
her
third
verse
she
suffered
a
lapse
of
memory
hesitated
and
started
the
fourth
this
passed
unnoticed
by
her
audience
who
gave
her
a
vociferous
ovation
at
the
close
the
programme
the
programme
they
yelled
as
a
rule
nichoune
would
disdainfully
refuse
to
go
down
among
the
audience
this
evening
however
she
nodded
a
yes
and
taking
a
pile
of
little
programmes
from
the
wings
she
descended
the
few
steps
which
led
from
the
stage
to
the
body
of
the
hall
twenty
hands
were
outstretched
to
help
her
down
she
pushed
them
aside
with
mocking
looks
shouts
of
admiration
compliments
clamourous
declarations
of
love
were
rained
on
her
by
the
soldiers
she
had
charmed
and
now
swung
past
with
a
provocative
swish
of
her
skirt
and
a
smile
of
disdain
nichoune
went
on
her
way
bent
on
getting
rid
of
her
burden
of
programmes
with
all
speed
just
as
another
singer
appeared
on
the
platform
nichoune
reached
the
last
row
of
chairs
and
was
about
to
leave
when
she
heard
her
name
uttered
in
a
low
voice
by
a
man
enveloped
in
a
large
cloak
he
was
standing
and
was
leaning
against
the
wall
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
he
was
an
aged
man
nichoune
hesitated
searching
with
her
eyes
for
the
person
who
had
called
her
in
a
low
penetrating
voice
she
was
about
to
continue
on
her
way
when
the
old
fellow
half
opened
his
cloak
for
an
instant
to
give
her
a
glimpse
of
a
bulky
kind
of
a
box
which
was
slung
across
his
chest
immediately
the
singer
went
straight
towards
him
a
programme
she
asked
him
in
a
loud
voice
he
gave
an
affirmative
nod
for
all
the
world
to
see
then
whispered
low
go
home
directly
the
concert
is
over
i
must
speak
to
you
very
good
replied
the
singer
in
a
submissive
tone
then
aloud
she
queried
you
are
a
musician
are
you
the
man
in
the
cloak
gave
answer
audibly
yes
my
dear
i
am
a
musician
also
but
not
of
your
sort
it
not
gaiety
i
deal
in
with
that
the
unknown
displayed
an
accordion
which
was
slung
across
his
chest
nichoune
hurried
to
her
she
must
get
away
before
her
admirers
demanded
her
reappearance
on
the
platform
the
old
man
quitted
the
establishment
stepping
out
of
the
vestibule
dimly
lighted
by
a
flickering
jet
of
gas
he
strode
along
the
narrow
and
tortuous
streets
of
châlons
at
a
great
pace
this
pedestrian
seemed
out
of
humour
he
marched
along
bent
beneath
the
weight
of
his
accordion
tapping
the
road
violently
with
the
point
of
his
long
climbing
stick
taking
a
circuitous
route
he
at
last
reached
a
sort
of
little
inn
it
appeared
a
poor
kind
of
a
place
but
clean
the
old
fellow
entered
with
a
resolute
air
the
porter
half
asleep
offered
him
a
candle
which
he
lit
with
a
twist
of
paper
kindled
at
the
the
old
man
mounted
the
stairs
to
his
room
and
closed
the
door
carefully
having
satisfied
himself
that
the
window
shutters
were
fastened
he
took
off
his
cloak
lit
his
lamp
drew
up
a
chair
and
leaned
his
elbow
on
the
table
the
light
fell
on
his
face
and
it
was
easy
to
recognise
the
man
who
had
spoken
to
the
mistress
of
corporal
vinson
he
was
none
other
than
vagualame
the
before
long
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
who
is
there
i
nichoune
vagualame
rose
and
opened
to
her
come
in
my
dear
vagualame
was
now
the
amiable
friend
he
looked
with
delight
at
the
pretty
little
face
of
his
visitor
as
pretty
as
ever
my
dear
prettier
than
ever
he
cried
he
stopped
flattery
the
singer
evidently
disliked
it
she
seated
herself
on
the
edge
of
a
sofa
and
stared
at
him
i
do
suppose
you
have
come
to
châlons
just
to
tell
me
that
nothing
serious
vagualame
shrugged
his
shoulders
no
no
why
in
heaven
name
are
you
always
so
frightened
that
all
very
well
it
jolly
dangerous
let
me
tell
you
dangerous
repeated
vagualame
contemptuously
absurd
you
are
joking
it
dangerous
for
imbeciles
not
for
anyone
else
not
a
soul
would
ever
suspect
that
pretty
nichoune
is
the
the
intermediary
between
me
and
you
are
going
to
give
me
something
for
roubaix
again
nichoune
did
not
look
as
if
vagualame
assertion
had
relieved
her
fears
vagualame
evaded
a
direct
answer
you
have
not
seen
him
for
a
week
roubaix
and
nancy
nor
nancy
well
said
he
after
a
moment
reflection
that
does
not
matter
in
the
least
i
can
now
tell
you
that
belfort
will
certainly
pass
this
way
belfort
but
he
is
not
due
then
belfort
has
no
fixed
time
replied
vagualame
sharply
i
have
already
told
you
that
belfort
is
his
own
master
his
is
a
divisional
a
divisional
what
exactly
is
a
divisional
demanded
the
singer
now
you
are
asking
questions
objected
vagualame
his
tone
was
harsh
that
is
not
allowed
nichoune
i
have
told
you
so
before
what
you
do
not
know
you
must
not
try
to
discover
i
myself
do
not
know
all
the
ins
and
outs
of
the
organisation
he
continued
in
a
less
severe
tone
in
any
case
belfort
passes
this
way
between
eleven
and
noon
he
does
not
know
me
is
not
aware
of
my
existence
it
is
through
an
indirect
course
that
i
learned
he
was
coming
also
that
he
would
have
something
to
say
to
you
will
you
therefore
hand
him
this
envelope
vagualame
drew
from
the
inside
pocket
of
his
short
coat
a
large
packet
sealed
with
red
wax
be
very
careful
this
document
is
important
has
been
difficult
to
obtain
extremely
difficult
on
no
account
must
it
go
astray
tell
belfort
that
it
must
be
handed
over
as
quickly
as
possible
well
nichoune
did
not
take
the
packet
vagualame
was
holding
out
to
her
she
remained
seated
her
gaze
fixed
on
the
tips
of
her
shoes
her
hands
buried
in
her
muff
well
what
is
it
what
are
you
waiting
for
vagualame
repeated
at
this
nichoune
blazed
out
what
the
matter
is
why
that
i
have
had
enough
of
all
this
i
want
any
more
of
it
not
if
i
know
it
it
too
dangerous
vagualame
appeared
stupefied
what
little
one
he
asked
very
gently
you
do
not
wish
to
be
our
faithful
any
more
no
you
do
not
want
to
hand
this
over
to
belfort
no
no
a
hundred
times
no
nichoune
shook
her
head
vigorously
but
why
because
because
i
do
want
to
do
it
any
more
there
come
now
nichoune
what
is
your
reason
you
must
have
one
this
time
the
singer
got
up
as
though
she
would
go
off
at
once
reasons
she
cried
look
here
vagualame
it
better
to
tell
you
the
truth
very
well
then
spying
is
not
my
strong
point
it
is
three
months
since
i
began
it
since
you
enticed
me
into
it
and
life
is
not
worth
living
i
am
in
a
constant
state
of
terror
i
am
afraid
of
being
caught
at
it
they
say
this
do
that
i
am
always
seeing
new
agents
you
come
you
go
you
disappear
it
maddening
i
have
already
broken
with
my
lover
with
vinson
i
do
want
to
be
on
such
terms
with
anyone
mixed
up
in
your
spying
i
can
tell
you
in
the
first
place
there
something
wrong
with
my
heart
and
to
live
in
such
a
perpetual
state
of
terror
is
very
bad
for
me
so
you
have
got
to
understand
vagualame
i
say
it
straight
out
i
go
on
with
it
i
would
rather
go
to
the
magistrate
and
put
myself
completely
outside
this
abominable
business
there
that
all
about
it
it
was
impossible
to
mistake
the
meaning
of
these
decisive
words
here
was
not
the
spy
who
sought
to
increase
his
pay
by
threatening
to
reveal
everything
it
was
the
spy
who
is
obsessed
with
the
fear
of
being
taken
who
no
longer
wishes
to
continue
his
dreadful
work
to
follow
his
nefarious
calling
vagualame
gave
no
sign
of
surprise
listen
my
pretty
one
you
are
at
perfect
liberty
to
do
what
seems
good
to
you
and
if
you
have
just
come
in
for
some
money
no
one
has
left
me
any
money
interrupted
nichoune
oh
well
replied
vagualame
if
you
despise
the
nice
sum
i
bring
you
every
month
that
your
business
but
i
do
suppose
you
want
to
leave
your
old
comrade
in
a
fix
do
you
nichoune
hesitated
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
now
she
asked
a
very
little
thing
my
pretty
one
if
you
will
not
go
in
with
us
any
longer
you
are
perfectly
free
to
leave
us
i
repeat
it
but
leave
us
in
the
lurch
just
at
this
moment
this
paper
is
of
the
very
greatest
importance
be
nice
take
it
and
give
it
to
belfort
i
will
not
bother
you
again
after
nichoune
held
out
her
hand
but
it
was
with
an
ill
grace
oh
all
right
said
she
give
me
the
thing
all
the
same
you
know
now
that
it
is
the
very
last
time
you
are
to
apply
to
me
then
she
added
laughing
in
her
usual
way
and
pressing
the
old
fellow
hand
as
she
moved
towards
the
door
i
do
mean
to
be
the
of
châlons
any
more
ended
the
last
collection
has
been
made
nichoune
departed
vagualame
wished
her
a
cordial
good
night
then
locking
the
door
he
became
absorbed
in
his
reflections
towards
five
in
the
afternoon
of
the
day
following
his
private
talk
with
nichoune
vagualame
accosted
the
proprietor
of
a
little
inn
situated
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
town
and
far
removed
from
the
tavern
where
he
had
passed
the
night
mademoiselle
nichoune
is
not
in
is
she
no
my
good
man
what
do
you
want
with
her
vagualame
gave
a
little
laugh
has
she
not
told
you
then
that
she
was
expecting
someone
from
her
part
of
the
country
to
call
on
her
the
innkeeper
was
leaning
carelessly
against
the
wall
he
straightened
himself
a
little
yes
mademoiselle
nichoune
has
told
us
that
an
old
musician
would
call
to
see
her
this
afternoon
and
that
we
must
ask
him
to
ah
she
a
good
kind
little
thing
how
courageous
what
a
worker
vagualame
seemed
to
be
speaking
to
himself
you
know
her
very
well
then
asked
the
puzzled
innkeeper
i
should
think
i
did
protested
the
old
fellow
why
it
was
i
who
taught
her
to
sing
do
you
think
she
will
be
long
my
little
nichoune
i
do
fancy
so
if
you
would
like
to
come
in
and
wait
for
her
in
her
room
you
will
find
it
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
it
not
locked
you
will
find
some
picture
papers
on
her
table
thank
you
kind
sir
said
vagualame
after
a
moment
hesitation
i
will
go
in
and
rest
for
a
few
minutes
and
hobbling
along
he
gained
the
singer
room
the
moment
he
was
inside
and
the
door
safely
shut
his
whole
attitude
changed
he
looked
eagerly
about
him
if
there
is
anything
where
is
it
likely
to
be
he
considered
why
in
the
mattress
of
course
he
drew
from
some
in
his
garments
a
long
needle
and
began
to
probe
the
mattress
of
nichoune
bed
very
carefully
ha
ha
cried
he
suddenly
the
needle
had
come
in
contact
with
something
difficult
to
penetrate
i
wager
it
what
i
am
after
vagualame
slipped
his
hand
spare
and
delicately
formed
under
the
counterpane
little
idiot
he
exclaimed
in
a
satisfied
tone
she
has
not
even
hidden
it
inside
the
mattress
she
has
just
slipped
it
in
between
the
palliasse
and
the
hair
mattress
on
top
why
she
a
child
he
drew
out
two
envelopes
and
eagerly
read
the
addresses
oh
cried
he
this
is
more
serious
than
i
thought
action
must
be
taken
at
once
nichoune
nichoune
you
are
about
to
play
a
dangerous
game
a
game
which
is
likely
to
cost
you
dear
on
the
first
of
the
envelopes
vagualame
had
read
one
word
this
was
the
document
he
had
handed
over
to
the
actress
the
night
before
after
all
he
was
not
much
astonished
to
find
that
nichoune
had
not
passed
the
letter
on
but
the
other
envelope
bore
an
address
which
vagualame
gazed
at
reflectively
monsieur
bonnett
police
magistrate
she
is
selling
us
by
jove
he
murmured
there
not
a
doubt
of
it
the
little
wretch
she
has
scruples
has
she
her
conscience
reproaches
her
i
am
going
to
give
her
a
lesson
one
of
my
own
sort
vagualame
was
turning
the
letter
over
and
over
i
must
know
its
contents
he
went
on
ah
i
shall
manage
to
get
hold
of
this
little
paper
morning
vagualame
murmured
monologue
came
to
an
abrupt
conclusion
that
her
voice
he
exclaimed
with
the
nimbleness
of
youth
he
put
back
the
two
letters
rapidly
drew
from
his
pocket
a
bundle
of
letters
with
marvellous
ability
forced
open
a
table
drawer
and
mixed
them
with
others
nichoune
had
placed
there
there
my
little
dear
said
he
aloud
there
something
to
do
honour
to
your
memory
he
closed
the
drawer
in
a
second
he
had
barely
time
to
seat
himself
in
an
near
his
accordion
lying
on
the
floor
when
nichoune
entered
good
day
cried
she
vagualame
pretended
to
wake
up
with
a
start
ha
ha
good
day
nichoune
tell
me
you
have
not
seen
belfort
eh
how
do
you
know
that
demanded
nichoune
on
the
defensive
she
looked
surprised
i
have
just
met
him
he
told
me
that
he
had
not
come
across
you
at
the
usual
nichoune
lowered
her
head
i
thought
i
was
being
followed
so
as
you
can
understand
i
did
not
go
vagualame
nodded
approval
good
quite
right
after
all
it
is
not
otherwise
of
importance
you
must
give
me
back
my
envelope
now
you
want
it
why
of
course
nichoune
hesitated
a
second
just
fancy
vagualame
i
took
the
precaution
to
hide
it
between
my
two
mattresses
wait
here
it
is
nichoune
held
out
his
letter
thank
you
my
dear
vagualame
looked
as
if
the
returning
of
the
document
was
a
matter
of
the
most
perfect
indifference
to
him
he
gazed
hard
at
nichoune
stared
so
fixedly
at
her
that
she
demanded
whatever
possesses
you
to
stare
at
me
like
that
i
am
thinking
how
pretty
you
are
well
i
never
you
are
becoming
quite
complimentary
it
no
flattery
i
think
you
are
very
pretty
nichoune
but
your
hands
they
are
not
pretty
the
singer
laughed
and
held
out
her
little
hands
what
is
there
about
them
you
have
to
find
fault
with
they
are
red
it
astonishes
me
that
a
woman
like
you
does
not
know
how
to
make
them
white
do
you
know
what
to
do
to
them
no
what
must
i
do
why
retorted
the
old
musician
the
very
first
thing
you
have
to
do
is
as
simple
as
a
b
c
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
tie
up
your
hands
every
night
with
a
ribbon
and
so
keep
them
raised
above
your
head
how
i
do
understand
it
like
this
you
stick
a
nail
into
the
wall
and
then
you
manage
things
so
that
you
keep
your
hands
the
whole
night
through
you
will
see
then
your
hands
will
be
as
white
as
lilies
in
the
morning
white
as
lilies
nichoune
was
extremely
interested
is
that
true
i
shall
try
it
this
very
night
white
like
lilies
you
say
and
you
have
to
sleep
with
your
hands
stuck
up
in
the
air
i
shall
try
it
shall
begin
a
few
minutes
later
vagualame
left
nichoune
after
promising
that
he
would
not
give
her
any
more
spy
work
to
do
and
declaring
that
she
should
never
again
be
mixed
up
in
any
dangerous
business
as
he
went
along
the
streets
of
châlons
the
dreadful
old
man
chuckled
and
sniggered
hands
in
the
air
my
beauty
just
try
that
this
very
night
with
that
little
heart
mischief
of
yours
ha
ha
we
shall
not
be
kept
waiting
for
the
consequences
of
that
performance
it
will
serve
as
an
example
to
all
and
sundry
when
they
wish
to
write
to
the
magistrate
vagualame
face
took
on
a
wicked
look
i
shall
have
to
be
as
careful
as
can
be
when
i
hide
myself
in
that
little
fool
room
at
all
costs
i
must
get
hold
of
that
compromising
letter
before
anyone
in
the
hotel
hears
of
the
death
not
a
soul
must
catch
a
glimpse
of
me
that
certain
those
who
passed
vagualame
simply
thought
he
was
an
old
beggar
an
old
accordion
player
ix
with
the
of
state
come
in
cried
hofferman
who
was
writing
hard
an
orderly
stepped
gingerly
into
the
room
an
usher
colonel
with
a
message
begging
you
to
be
so
good
as
to
step
downstairs
at
once
to
see
the
of
state
hofferman
looked
up
are
you
sure
the
message
is
for
me
yes
colonel
very
well
i
am
coming
immediately
the
orderly
vanished
hofferman
remained
in
thought
for
a
minute
or
so
rose
abruptly
half
opened
the
door
of
the
adjoining
room
and
addressed
commandant
dumoulin
the
of
state
wishes
to
see
me
i
am
going
down
now
the
colonel
passed
rapidly
along
the
interminable
corridors
separating
him
from
the
building
in
which
the
offices
were
situated
what
can
he
want
to
see
me
about
colonel
hofferman
asked
himself
as
he
entered
the
room
monsieur
maranjévol
an
exceedingly
active
and
immensely
popular
deputy
from
la
gironde
to
whom
had
been
entrusted
the
delicate
task
of
serving
as
buffer
between
the
civil
and
the
military
sections
monsieur
maranjévol
was
not
alone
in
his
vast
with
its
gilding
and
pictures
of
battle
scenes
seated
opposite
and
with
his
back
to
the
light
was
a
civilian
of
middle
height
whose
thin
hair
turning
grey
curled
slightly
at
the
nape
of
the
neck
the
rose
shook
hands
with
the
colonel
and
went
straight
to
the
point
monsieur
juve
of
the
detective
force
colonel
hofferman
head
of
the
second
bureau
the
policeman
and
the
soldier
bowed
gravely
they
awaited
the
beginning
of
the
conference
in
a
somewhat
chilly
silence
monsieur
maranjévol
explained
that
after
a
short
talk
with
juve
regarding
captain
brocq
death
he
had
considered
it
necessary
to
put
him
in
touch
with
colonel
hofferman
the
colonel
who
had
been
showing
signs
of
impatience
for
the
last
few
minutes
suddenly
broke
out
my
faith
monsieur
declared
he
in
a
sharp
abrupt
voice
staring
straight
into
juve
eyes
i
am
very
glad
to
have
the
opportunity
of
meeting
you
i
shall
not
disguise
from
you
that
i
am
astonished
even
very
disagreeably
astonished
at
your
attitude
during
the
past
few
days
regarding
this
wretched
drama
up
to
now
i
have
always
considered
that
the
private
personality
of
an
officer
above
all
of
an
officer
on
the
headquarters
staff
was
a
thing
which
was
almost
inviolable
but
it
has
come
to
my
knowledge
that
at
the
death
of
captain
brocq
you
have
devoted
yourself
not
only
to
making
the
most
minute
investigations
that
perhaps
was
your
right
and
your
duty
into
the
circumstances
accompanying
the
death
but
that
you
have
searched
the
domicile
of
the
defunct
as
well
and
this
without
giving
us
the
required
preliminary
notice
i
can
not
and
will
not
sanction
this
method
of
procedure
and
i
congratulate
myself
on
having
this
opportunity
of
telling
you
so
during
this
speech
of
the
colonel
monsieur
maranjévol
stared
with
astonished
eyes
first
at
the
soldier
and
then
at
the
detective
the
and
peaceable
was
surprised
at
the
colonel
violent
attack
and
asked
himself
how
juve
was
going
to
take
it
juve
took
it
with
an
unmoved
countenance
he
said
in
his
turn
i
would
point
out
to
you
colonel
that
had
it
been
only
a
question
of
a
natural
death
i
should
have
contented
myself
with
restoring
to
you
the
documents
which
had
been
collected
at
our
headquarters
but
as
you
probably
knew
captain
brocq
was
killed
killed
in
a
mysterious
fashion
i
thus
found
myself
in
the
presence
of
a
crime
a
common
law
crime
the
inquest
has
restored
it
to
the
civil
law
jurisdiction
and
not
to
the
military
believe
me
i
understand
my
business
i
know
my
duty
juve
had
uttered
these
words
with
the
greatest
composure
but
the
slight
tremble
in
his
voice
would
have
made
it
clear
to
anyone
who
knew
him
well
that
the
detective
was
maintaining
his
only
by
a
violent
effort
the
colonel
replied
in
a
tone
stiff
with
offence
i
persist
in
my
opinion
you
have
no
right
to
meddle
in
an
affair
which
concerns
us
alone
the
death
of
captain
brocq
coincides
with
the
loss
of
a
certain
secret
document
is
it
for
you
or
for
us
to
institute
an
enquiry
into
it
after
a
pause
juve
retort
was
you
must
permit
me
to
leave
that
question
unanswered
with
all
the
bluntness
of
a
military
man
colonel
hofferman
had
put
his
finger
on
the
open
wound
which
for
long
years
had
been
a
source
of
irritation
to
the
detective
force
and
the
intelligence
department
alike
when
owing
to
circumstances
both
were
called
on
to
intervene
at
one
and
the
same
time
in
cases
of
theft
and
of
spying
the
conflict
was
ceaseless
monsieur
havard
juve
chief
had
talked
this
matter
over
the
night
before
and
his
last
words
of
command
were
above
all
juve
manage
matters
so
that
there
is
no
fuss
there
must
not
be
a
fuss
colonel
hofferman
misinterpreting
the
detective
attitude
turned
triumphantly
to
the
not
only
that
he
continued
i
think
there
has
been
far
too
much
talk
made
about
the
death
of
captain
brocq
this
officer
was
the
victim
of
an
accident
we
can
not
discuss
it
that
is
all
there
is
to
be
said
it
really
does
not
matter
much
we
of
the
intelligence
department
are
soldiers
and
believe
in
a
policy
of
results
at
the
present
moment
we
have
lost
a
document
we
are
searching
for
it
action
must
be
left
to
us
and
monsieur
i
revert
to
my
first
question
what
the
devil
was
the
police
doing
at
captain
brocq
what
business
was
it
of
theirs
really
the
detective
service
is
arrogating
to
itself
more
and
more
powers
powers
that
can
not
be
sanctioned
that
will
not
be
granted
or
permitted
juve
had
so
far
contained
himself
though
with
difficulty
but
now
colonel
hofferman
was
going
too
far
it
was
juve
turn
to
break
out
monsieur
he
cried
in
a
voice
vibrating
with
passion
turning
to
the
i
can
not
accept
such
observations
not
for
a
moment
i
have
among
my
papers
on
the
case
important
proofs
that
the
assassination
of
captain
brocq
is
surrounded
with
mysterious
occurrences
and
also
of
the
gravest
nature
the
theory
colonel
hofferman
has
just
put
forward
will
not
hold
water
it
does
not
hang
together
to
gain
a
full
understanding
of
a
thing
one
must
begin
at
the
beginning
this
beginning
i
have
brought
and
i
make
you
judge
monsieur
of
whether
or
no
it
is
worth
the
most
careful
consideration
caught
between
two
fires
the
looked
exceedingly
sorry
for
himself
above
everything
he
dreaded
being
forced
to
act
as
umpire
between
hofferman
and
juve
there
was
no
escape
however
so
with
a
weary
air
he
asked
juve
to
make
his
case
clear
well
gentlemen
began
our
detective
who
had
fully
regained
his
you
know
what
the
circumstances
were
which
led
me
to
the
discovery
that
captain
brocq
had
been
mysteriously
assassinated
it
was
obviously
of
the
first
importance
that
i
should
learn
every
detail
regarding
his
private
life
get
to
know
with
whom
he
had
intercourse
who
his
correspondents
were
find
out
where
he
was
accustomed
to
go
so
that
being
thoroughly
posted
up
regarding
his
personality
i
could
discover
to
whose
interest
it
would
be
that
he
should
disappear
i
went
to
brocq
flat
in
the
rue
de
lille
to
collect
evidence
from
various
sources
i
have
it
all
written
down
in
my
case
papers
one
fact
stands
out
clearly
captain
brocq
was
regularly
visited
by
a
woman
whom
we
have
not
as
yet
been
able
to
identify
beyond
a
doubt
but
we
shall
soon
know
who
she
is
i
am
certain
she
is
a
lady
of
fashion
she
was
his
mistress
the
commencement
of
a
letter
written
to
her
by
the
deceased
shows
this
but
unfortunately
he
has
not
addressed
her
by
name
the
letter
was
begun
according
to
the
experts
some
hours
before
the
drama
of
assassination
was
enacted
it
is
the
mauve
document
number
it
commences
juve
showed
this
sheet
of
mauve
letter
paper
to
his
listeners
colonel
hofferman
seemed
to
attach
no
importance
whatever
to
it
juve
continued
i
should
greatly
value
colonel
hofferman
opinion
regarding
the
suppositions
i
am
about
to
formulate
well
gentlemen
here
is
what
i
deduce
from
my
investigations
captain
brocq
was
a
simple
modest
fellow
a
hard
worker
reasonable
temperate
officer
a
good
citizen
in
fact
if
captain
brocq
had
an
irregular
love
affair
it
was
assuredly
with
the
best
intentions
brocq
who
perhaps
had
not
been
able
to
resist
his
senses
was
too
straight
a
man
to
willingly
entertain
the
idea
of
not
regularising
the
union
later
on
is
that
your
opinion
colonel
hofferman
frankly
replied
it
is
my
opinion
monsieur
juve
that
was
certainly
captain
character
but
i
do
not
see
what
you
are
driving
at
at
this
replied
the
detective
captain
brocq
mistress
must
be
looked
for
not
among
women
of
the
lower
orders
but
among
those
of
a
higher
class
who
are
more
outwardly
correct
at
any
rate
more
women
of
the
world
among
those
with
whom
brocq
was
on
friendly
terms
was
the
family
of
an
old
diplomat
of
austrian
extraction
a
monsieur
de
naarboveck
this
de
naarboveck
has
a
daughter
she
is
twenty
this
mademoiselle
wilhelmine
was
terribly
distressed
and
in
a
state
of
profound
grief
the
day
after
brocq
death
i
am
not
going
so
far
as
to
pretend
that
mademoiselle
de
naarboveck
was
brocq
mistress
but
one
might
easily
think
so
how
do
you
know
that
mademoiselle
de
naarboveck
showed
grief
at
the
death
of
captain
brocq
through
a
journalist
who
was
received
in
the
de
naarboveck
family
circle
the
day
after
the
drama
oh
a
journalist
protested
the
colonel
juve
smiled
slily
a
journalist
not
like
the
others
it
was
jérôme
fandor
colonel
he
went
to
de
naarboveck
to
fulfill
a
mission
entrusted
to
him
by
those
in
high
places
the
minister
of
the
cut
the
inspector
short
we
know
all
about
that
monsieur
juve
besides
the
person
whom
the
minister
wished
to
learn
something
about
was
not
monsieur
de
naarboveck
daughter
but
her
companion
a
young
woman
named
and
nicknamed
bobinette
finished
juve
what
do
you
think
of
her
asked
the
juve
reply
was
an
indirect
one
the
more
i
think
about
it
the
more
i
am
tempted
to
believe
that
wilhelmine
de
naarboveck
was
brocq
mistress
oh
in
the
right
way
in
all
honour
and
that
in
the
background
surreptitiously
a
third
person
pushed
herself
into
their
confidence
was
the
recipient
of
their
secret
and
on
this
account
she
could
take
a
good
many
liberties
with
them
berthe
or
bobinette
was
this
third
person
of
course
she
is
known
to
have
visited
brocq
repeatedly
now
what
was
she
doing
there
what
was
her
object
well
we
have
to
get
a
clear
idea
of
what
happened
and
draw
our
conclusions
remember
brocq
left
his
flat
in
great
haste
on
the
afternoon
of
his
assassination
he
took
a
taxi
at
the
des
and
drove
off
in
pursuit
of
someone
why
we
do
not
know
yet
but
this
someone
was
a
woman
and
i
am
convinced
the
woman
was
bobinette
what
is
bobinette
social
position
gentlemen
i
wish
i
could
define
it
in
a
single
word
but
it
is
here
that
i
enter
the
region
of
enigmas
here
is
mystery
on
mystery
without
breaking
the
seal
of
professional
secrecy
i
may
tell
you
that
this
woman
should
be
known
to
me
i
say
because
i
still
lack
precise
information
about
her
i
await
this
information
with
impatience
i
fear
it
also
for
juve
stopped
short
got
up
and
began
pacing
the
immense
room
drawing
up
before
the
and
colonel
hofferman
he
gazed
at
them
his
manner
was
impressive
gentlemen
said
he
in
a
quiet
penetrating
voice
and
with
an
air
of
intense
conviction
gentlemen
if
my
conjectures
are
correct
bobinette
is
naught
but
a
girl
of
low
birth
of
the
lowest
a
creature
who
will
stick
at
nothing
who
has
been
mixed
up
with
a
band
of
criminals
the
most
cunning
the
most
artful
the
most
unscrupulous
the
most
dangerous
band
of
criminals
in
all
this
round
world
a
band
i
have
time
and
again
pursued
decimated
broken
up
dispersed
only
to
see
them
spring
to
an
associated
evil
life
again
a
ceaseless
rebirth
of
maleficent
forces
forming
and
reforming
a
malevolent
monster
a
band
gentlemen
of
incarnated
evil
the
band
of
fantômas
juve
became
silent
he
wiped
his
forehead
the
harsh
voice
of
colonel
hofferman
broke
the
silence
hypotheses
true
to
this
extent
monsieur
juve
that
brocq
may
very
well
have
had
a
mistress
we
are
all
agreed
about
that
but
in
reality
it
is
simply
romance
there
was
a
discreet
knock
at
the
door
what
is
it
demanded
the
the
form
of
an
usher
showed
itself
in
the
doorway
he
entered
and
turning
towards
the
said
excuse
me
sir
then
addressing
colonel
hofferman
captain
loreuil
sends
me
to
tell
colonel
hofferman
that
he
has
returned
and
has
a
communication
of
extreme
urgency
to
lay
before
him
the
captain
must
wait
cried
hofferman
in
a
harsh
authoritative
tone
but
the
usher
fulfilling
his
orders
replied
the
captain
anticipated
this
answer
colonel
and
told
me
to
add
that
the
communication
can
not
wait
the
usher
withdrew
hofferman
glanced
questioningly
at
the
go
to
him
colonel
and
return
as
soon
as
possible
the
addressed
juve
the
government
is
greatly
annoyed
by
all
these
incidents
which
are
assuming
enormous
proportions
are
you
aware
that
rumours
of
war
are
becoming
public
opinion
is
in
a
most
unsettled
state
things
are
bad
on
the
bourse
too
going
from
bad
to
worse
really
it
is
all
most
distressing
with
a
movement
of
sympathetic
acquiescence
juve
said
gently
i
can
not
help
it
monsieur
it
was
noon
twelve
was
striking
x
aunt
palmyra
early
in
the
morning
of
the
day
on
which
the
meeting
took
place
in
the
private
office
of
the
of
state
the
proprietor
of
three
at
châlons
was
busy
bottling
his
wine
dawn
was
just
breaking
and
the
good
man
had
a
spirit
lamp
in
his
cellar
to
throw
light
upon
his
task
suddenly
his
bottling
operations
were
disturbed
by
an
unknown
voice
calling
him
insistently
from
the
top
of
the
steps
hey
there
father
louis
where
is
father
louis
fuming
and
grumbling
the
innkeeper
mounted
his
and
appeared
on
the
porch
i
am
father
louis
what
am
i
wanted
for
the
publican
found
himself
face
to
face
with
an
enormously
stout
woman
a
grotesque
figure
clad
in
garments
so
cut
that
they
exaggerated
her
stoutness
a
large
shawl
was
thrown
round
her
shoulders
on
her
head
was
a
big
round
hat
tied
with
strings
in
a
bow
under
her
chin
this
odd
was
topped
with
a
bunch
of
gaudy
feathers
ragged
and
out
of
curl
a
veil
of
flowery
design
half
hid
this
woman
features
though
far
from
her
first
youth
she
no
doubt
wished
to
appear
young
still
the
skin
of
her
face
was
covered
with
powder
and
paint
so
badly
laid
on
that
daubs
of
white
of
red
and
blue
lay
side
by
side
in
all
their
crudity
there
was
no
soft
blending
of
tints
it
was
the
of
no
artist
hand
what
an
object
thought
the
publican
staring
at
this
oddity
who
had
seated
herself
on
the
porch
seat
and
had
placed
on
the
ground
a
great
wicker
basket
filled
with
vegetables
ouf
she
cried
it
is
a
long
step
to
your
canteen
father
louis
my
word
i
never
thought
i
should
get
here
well
now
how
is
my
little
pet
of
a
girl
nonplussed
suspicious
father
louis
looked
hard
at
this
strange
visitor
never
had
he
seen
anyone
like
her
what
astonished
him
was
to
hear
her
calling
him
by
the
name
used
only
by
his
familiars
whoever
are
you
he
asked
in
a
surly
tone
i
do
remember
you
that
not
surprising
cried
the
visitor
who
seemed
of
a
gay
disposition
for
she
always
laughed
at
the
close
of
every
sentence
my
goodness
it
would
be
queer
if
you
did
not
recognise
me
considering
you
have
never
seen
me
before
i
am
aunt
palmyra
let
me
tell
you
the
innkeeper
more
and
more
out
of
countenance
searched
his
memory
in
vain
aunt
palmyra
he
echoed
why
of
course
you
big
stupid
nichoune
aunt
a
customer
of
yours
she
is
she
must
have
mentioned
me
often
i
adore
the
little
pet
father
louis
had
not
the
slightest
recollection
of
any
such
mention
but
out
of
politeness
he
murmured
of
course
why
of
course
well
then
old
dear
you
must
tell
me
where
she
hangs
out
here
i
must
go
and
give
her
a
hug
and
a
kiss
mechanically
the
innkeeper
directed
aunt
palmyra
on
the
ground
floor
end
of
the
passage
but
you
never
thinking
of
waking
nichoune
at
this
early
hour
she
make
a
pretty
noise
if
you
do
bah
cried
aunt
palmyra
wait
till
the
little
dear
sees
who
it
is
just
look
at
the
nice
things
i
brought
her
and
showing
him
the
vegetables
in
her
basket
she
began
to
drawl
in
a
voice
will
you
have
turnips
and
leeks
here
stuff
to
make
broth
of
the
best
it
will
make
her
think
of
bygone
days
when
she
lived
with
us
in
the
country
my
faith
thought
father
louis
if
nichoune
opens
her
mouth
aunt
palmyra
was
knocking
repeatedly
at
nichoune
door
but
there
was
no
response
well
what
a
sleep
she
having
likely
enough
replied
father
louis
considering
she
was
not
in
bed
till
four
all
the
same
this
persistent
silence
puzzled
the
innkeeper
he
tried
to
peep
through
the
keyhole
but
the
key
was
in
it
then
he
quietly
drew
a
gimlet
from
his
pocket
and
bored
a
hole
in
the
door
aunt
palmyra
watched
him
smiling
she
winked
and
jogged
his
elbow
ho
ho
my
boy
i
wager
you
do
stick
at
having
a
look
at
your
customers
this
way
when
it
suits
you
with
the
ease
of
practice
the
innkeeper
glued
his
eye
to
the
hole
he
had
just
made
he
uttered
an
exclamation
good
heavens
what
is
it
cried
nichoune
aunt
in
a
tone
of
alarm
is
her
room
empty
empty
no
father
louis
was
white
as
paper
he
searched
his
pocket
in
feverish
haste
drew
from
it
a
screwdriver
rapidly
detached
the
lock
and
rushed
into
the
room
followed
by
aunt
palmyra
who
bawled
oh
my
good
lord
whatever
is
the
matter
with
her
nichoune
was
stretched
out
on
her
bed
and
might
have
seemed
asleep
to
an
onlooker
were
it
not
for
two
things
which
at
once
struck
the
eye
her
face
was
all
purple
and
her
arms
sticking
straight
up
in
the
air
were
terrifyingly
white
and
rigid
approaching
the
bed
the
innkeeper
and
aunt
palmyra
saw
that
nichoune
arms
were
maintained
in
this
vertical
position
by
means
of
string
tied
round
her
wrists
and
fastened
to
the
canopy
over
the
bed
she
is
dead
cried
father
louis
this
is
awful
good
heavens
what
a
thing
to
happen
aunt
palmyra
for
all
her
previous
protestations
of
affection
for
her
charming
niece
did
not
seem
in
any
way
moved
by
the
tragic
discovery
she
glanced
rapidly
round
the
room
without
a
sign
of
emotion
this
attitude
only
lasted
a
moment
suddenly
she
broke
out
into
loud
lamentations
uttering
piercing
cries
she
threw
herself
into
an
then
sank
in
a
heap
on
the
sofa
then
returned
to
the
table
she
was
making
a
regular
nuisance
of
herself
the
innkeeper
scared
and
bewildered
did
not
know
how
to
act
he
was
staring
fixedly
at
the
unfortunate
nichoune
who
gave
no
sign
of
life
involuntarily
the
man
had
touched
the
dead
girl
shoulder
the
body
was
quite
cold
the
innkeeper
who
had
been
driven
into
a
state
of
distracted
bewilderment
by
aunt
palmyra
behaviour
now
bethought
him
of
his
obvious
duty
of
course
he
must
call
in
the
police
and
also
avoid
scandal
also
he
must
stop
this
old
woman
outrageous
be
quiet
he
commanded
you
are
not
to
make
such
a
noise
stay
where
you
are
do
stir
from
that
corner
until
i
return
and
above
all
you
must
not
touch
a
single
thing
before
the
arrival
of
the
police
the
police
moaned
aunt
palmyra
it
is
frightful
oh
my
poor
nichoune
however
could
this
have
happened
nevertheless
scarcely
had
the
innkeeper
retired
than
the
old
woman
with
remarkable
dexterity
rummaged
about
among
the
disordered
furniture
and
seized
a
certain
number
of
papers
which
she
hid
in
her
bodice
hardly
had
she
pushed
them
out
of
sight
when
the
innkeeper
returned
accompanied
by
a
policeman
it
was
in
vain
that
father
louis
endeavoured
to
get
the
policeman
into
the
tragic
room
he
did
not
wish
to
do
anything
i
tell
you
he
repeated
in
his
big
voice
it
not
worth
my
while
looking
at
this
corpse
for
the
superintendent
will
be
here
shortly
and
he
will
take
charge
of
the
legal
procedure
at
the
end
of
about
ten
minutes
the
magistrate
appeared
accompanied
by
his
secretary
and
immediately
proceeded
to
a
summary
interrogation
of
the
innkeeper
but
in
the
presence
of
aunt
palmyra
it
was
impossible
to
do
any
serious
work
this
insupportable
old
woman
could
not
make
head
or
tail
of
the
questions
and
answered
at
random
leave
the
room
madame
leave
the
room
and
i
will
hear
what
you
have
to
say
presently
but
where
must
i
go
whined
aunt
palmyra
go
where
you
like
go
to
the
devil
shouted
the
exasperated
inspector
oh
well
i
suppose
i
ought
not
to
say
so
replied
the
old
woman
looking
seriously
offended
but
though
you
are
an
inspector
you
have
a
very
rude
tongue
in
your
head
to
emphasise
her
majestic
exit
aunt
palmyra
added
fancy
now
not
one
of
you
have
thought
of
it
i
am
going
as
far
as
the
corner
to
look
for
flowers
for
this
poor
little
thing
either
florists
were
difficult
to
find
or
aunt
palmyra
had
no
wish
to
see
them
as
she
passed
by
for
the
old
woman
walked
right
through
the
town
without
stopping
when
she
reached
the
railway
station
she
looked
at
the
clock
by
the
saints
i
have
barely
time
she
ejaculated
the
old
termagant
traversed
the
got
her
ticket
punched
it
was
a
return
ticket
and
stepped
on
to
the
platform
at
the
precise
moment
a
porter
was
crying
in
an
voice
passengers
for
paris
take
your
seats
aunt
palmyra
installed
herself
in
a
compartment
ladies
the
train
rolled
out
of
the
station
an
inspector
was
examining
the
tickets
at
the
at
excuse
me
sir
said
he
waking
a
passenger
who
had
fallen
fast
asleep
a
stout
man
with
a
smooth
face
and
scanty
hair
excuse
me
monsieur
but
you
are
in
a
ladies
the
man
leapt
up
and
rubbed
his
eyes
instinctively
with
the
gesture
of
a
man
he
took
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
a
large
pair
of
spectacles
in
gold
frames
and
stared
at
the
inspector
i
am
sorry
it
a
mistake
i
will
change
into
another
compartment
the
stranger
passed
along
the
connecting
corridor
carrying
a
small
bundle
of
clothes
wrapped
in
a
shawl
of
many
colours
an
hour
later
the
train
from
châlons
arrived
at
paris
ten
minutes
behind
time
directly
he
stood
on
the
platform
the
traveller
looked
at
his
watch
past
eleven
i
can
do
it
he
jumped
into
a
taxi
giving
his
orders
rue
saint
dominique
ministry
of
war
and
quick
shortly
after
the
unexpected
departure
of
colonel
hofferman
juve
judging
it
useless
to
prolong
the
conversation
had
quitted
the
of
state
office
instead
of
mounting
to
the
second
bureau
he
sent
in
his
name
to
commandant
dumoulin
although
their
acquaintance
was
but
slight
the
two
men
were
in
sympathy
each
realised
that
the
other
was
courageous
and
devoted
to
duty
both
were
enamoured
of
an
active
life
and
open
air
juve
was
hoping
that
at
all
events
he
would
hear
something
new
if
not
facts
about
the
affair
he
had
in
hand
at
least
with
regard
to
the
attitude
which
the
military
authorities
meant
to
take
up
commandant
dumoulin
however
knew
nothing
or
did
not
wish
to
say
anything
and
juve
was
about
to
leave
when
colonel
hofferman
entered
hofferman
looked
radiant
catching
sight
of
juve
he
smiled
ah
upon
my
word
i
did
not
expect
to
find
you
here
monsieur
but
since
you
are
you
will
be
glad
to
get
some
news
of
the
brocq
juve
eyes
were
shining
notes
of
interrogation
i
rendered
due
homage
to
your
perspicacity
just
now
continued
the
colonel
you
were
absolutely
right
in
your
prognostication
that
brocq
had
a
mistress
unfortunately
i
am
sorry
for
the
wound
to
your
the
correctness
of
your
version
stops
there
mistress
was
not
a
society
woman
as
you
thought
on
the
contrary
she
was
a
girl
of
the
lower
orders
a
singer
called
nichoune
of
châlons
you
have
proof
of
it
the
colonel
with
a
superior
air
held
out
a
packet
of
letters
to
juve
here
is
the
correspondence
letters
written
by
brocq
to
the
girl
one
of
my
collaborators
seized
them
at
girl
juve
scrutinised
the
letters
it
curious
he
said
half
to
himself
an
annoying
coincidence
but
the
name
of
nichoune
does
not
appear
once
in
these
letters
no
other
name
appears
observed
the
colonel
consequently
taking
into
consideration
the
place
where
these
letters
have
been
found
we
must
these
letters
had
no
envelopes
with
them
questioned
juve
no
there
were
none
but
what
matters
that
cried
the
colonel
very
queer
said
juve
in
a
meditative
tone
then
raising
his
voice
i
suppose
colonel
that
your
collaborator
before
taking
possession
of
these
letters
had
a
talk
with
the
person
who
had
received
them
did
he
manage
to
extract
any
information
hofferman
interrupted
juve
with
a
gesture
monsieur
juve
said
he
crossing
his
arms
i
am
going
to
give
you
another
surprise
my
collaborator
could
not
get
the
person
in
question
to
talk
and
for
a
very
good
reason
he
found
her
dead
dead
echoed
juve
that
is
as
i
say
the
detective
though
he
strove
to
hide
it
was
more
and
more
taken
aback
what
could
this
mean
no
doubt
he
would
soon
secure
additional
information
but
what
was
the
connecting
link
where
and
who
was
the
mysterious
person
who
was
really
pulling
the
strings
the
sarcastic
voice
of
the
colonel
tore
juve
from
his
reflections
and
questionings
monsieur
juve
i
think
it
is
high
time
we
had
some
lunch
but
before
we
separate
allow
me
to
give
you
a
word
of
advice
when
in
the
course
of
your
career
you
have
occasion
to
deal
with
matters
relating
to
spies
and
spying
leave
us
to
deal
with
them
that
is
what
we
are
here
for
as
for
you
content
yourself
with
ordinary
police
work
that
is
your
business
and
if
it
gives
you
pleasure
continue
your
hunt
for
fantômas
that
will
give
you
all
the
occupation
you
require
yes
continued
the
colonel
while
juve
was
clenching
his
fists
with
exasperation
at
this
irony
which
was
like
so
many
flicks
of
a
whip
on
his
face
yes
leave
these
serious
affairs
to
us
and
occupy
yourself
with
fantômas
xi
the
hooded
cloak
of
fantômas
leaning
on
his
jérôme
fandor
was
apparently
keeping
a
strict
watch
on
the
comings
and
goings
of
the
who
having
finished
their
sunday
walk
were
bending
their
steps
towards
dinner
a
quiet
evening
and
a
reposeful
night
seven
sounded
from
a
neighbouring
clock
its
strokes
borne
through
the
misty
atmosphere
darkened
by
fog
it
was
a
peaceful
moment
made
for
pleasurable
relaxation
ofter
the
activities
of
the
day
jérôme
fandor
however
was
not
enjoying
the
charm
of
the
hour
although
his
attitude
was
apparently
tranquil
listless
even
inwardly
he
was
in
a
state
of
fury
a
condition
of
feverish
enervation
to
be
so
near
success
he
thought
to
be
on
the
point
of
bringing
in
a
magnificent
haul
and
then
to
get
myself
locked
up
like
a
fool
no
not
if
i
can
help
it
why
it
would
be
enough
to
make
me
strangle
myself
with
my
handkerchief
as
they
believed
that
wretched
dollon
of
sinister
memory
did
in
the
past
he
smoked
cigarette
after
cigarette
raving
to
himself
yet
never
taking
his
eyes
off
the
pavements
where
tirelessly
ceaselessly
a
stream
of
pedestrians
passed
up
and
down
the
street
was
i
mistaken
i
wonder
he
went
on
still
i
can
not
help
fancying
that
youth
he
was
fifteen
at
the
most
that
sickly
young
blackguard
of
the
paris
pavements
who
followed
me
into
the
tube
then
took
the
same
train
as
i
did
who
was
behind
me
as
i
crossed
the
place
de
la
concorde
who
was
continually
and
persistently
on
my
tracks
i
can
not
think
he
was
there
by
chance
well
it
is
no
use
worrying
myself
into
a
fever
over
it
fandor
found
it
almost
impossible
to
recover
his
tranquillity
of
mind
again
and
again
in
the
course
of
the
day
he
had
come
across
the
same
individuals
during
his
peregrinations
which
took
him
from
one
end
of
paris
to
the
other
was
it
accident
coincidence
fatality
or
was
a
very
strict
watch
being
kept
over
his
movements
thus
fandor
had
asked
himself
whether
the
second
bureau
had
been
warned
of
the
part
he
had
played
with
regard
to
vinson
was
he
not
being
watched
and
shadowed
in
the
hope
of
running
the
treacherous
corporal
to
earth
if
the
second
bureau
had
decided
to
arrest
fandor
he
certainly
would
not
escape
i
shall
be
jailed
within
hours
thought
our
journalist
this
branch
of
the
detective
service
is
so
marvellously
organised
that
should
the
heads
of
it
look
upon
me
as
vinson
accomplice
they
will
arrest
me
before
i
have
time
to
parry
the
blow
in
that
case
the
band
of
traitors
i
pursue
and
am
on
the
point
of
unearthing
will
gain
enough
time
to
take
their
bearings
make
all
their
arrangements
and
disappear
without
counting
that
this
miserable
vinson
who
relies
on
my
help
will
be
caught
at
once
suddenly
fandor
left
his
post
of
observation
shut
his
window
and
went
to
the
telephone
i
must
put
juve
in
possession
of
all
the
facts
up
to
now
then
if
i
am
caught
juve
will
see
to
it
that
i
am
set
free
he
will
put
his
heart
into
it
i
know
unfortunately
it
was
not
juve
who
was
at
the
other
end
of
the
line
he
had
gone
out
his
old
servant
took
fandor
message
tell
monsieur
juve
directly
he
comes
in
that
i
can
not
go
out
but
that
i
absolutely
must
see
him
tell
him
the
matter
is
most
urgent
it
was
ten
at
night
corporal
vinson
was
dressing
in
haste
plague
take
it
he
cried
i
must
lose
a
moment
if
i
do
want
to
miss
my
train
vinson
was
dressing
in
fandor
bedroom
there
must
have
been
a
time
when
corporal
vinson
was
very
proud
of
putting
on
the
uniform
of
a
french
soldier
but
at
this
particular
moment
his
feelings
were
the
very
opposite
however
he
clad
himself
in
this
same
uniform
with
lightning
rapidity
careful
of
his
smart
appearance
the
corporal
examined
himself
in
the
glass
the
reflection
was
so
satisfactory
that
he
broke
into
smiles
undoubtedly
his
uniform
suited
him
there
was
a
violent
ring
at
the
vinson
jumped
he
began
to
tremble
who
can
it
be
at
this
hour
he
asked
himself
i
was
sure
something
would
happen
i
was
bound
to
catch
it
somehow
vinson
dared
not
risk
a
movement
he
stood
rigid
motionless
whoever
was
at
the
door
must
be
led
to
think
that
there
was
not
a
living
soul
in
fandor
flat
again
the
bell
rang
a
violent
ring
it
was
the
ring
of
someone
who
does
not
mean
to
go
away
who
knows
that
the
delay
in
opening
the
door
is
deliberate
plague
take
that
porter
murmured
the
corporal
i
again
the
bell
rang
violently
something
had
to
be
done
drops
of
sweat
rolled
down
the
face
by
jingo
this
business
is
going
to
end
very
badly
the
young
soldier
rapidly
drew
off
his
shoes
and
tiptoed
to
the
vestibule
through
the
keyhole
he
looked
to
see
who
was
ringing
for
the
fourth
time
and
more
violently
than
ever
no
sooner
had
vinson
looked
than
he
swore
softly
good
heavens
what
i
feared
it
an
agent
from
the
second
bureau
i
recognise
him
i
am
sold
there
not
a
doubt
of
it
ghastly
from
terror
vinson
watched
the
visitor
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
then
choose
a
key
from
his
bunch
ah
this
individual
has
a
and
i
i
have
an
idea
vinson
leaped
backwards
just
as
the
agent
was
putting
his
key
in
the
lock
and
rushed
towards
fandor
study
he
locked
the
door
at
the
precise
moment
the
agent
entered
the
flat
halt
cried
he
vinson
movements
had
been
heard
the
corporal
answer
was
to
the
door
what
you
are
doing
there
is
childish
cried
the
agent
i
have
give
yourself
up
taking
a
fresh
key
he
unlocked
the
door
vinson
had
just
closed
the
corporal
was
not
in
the
room
the
agent
rushed
to
another
door
which
led
from
the
study
to
the
he
opened
that
door
entered
the
it
was
empty
also
vinson
had
fled
to
the
room
adjoining
you
can
not
keep
at
it
cried
the
agent
you
see
the
doors
can
not
offer
a
moment
resistance
i
shall
corner
you
but
vinson
retreating
from
room
to
room
aimed
at
drawing
on
his
pursuer
to
the
last
room
of
the
flat
directly
the
agent
entered
the
vinson
quick
as
lightning
leapt
into
the
corridor
crossed
the
vestibule
at
a
bound
opened
the
door
leading
to
the
staircase
slamming
it
behind
him
on
the
landing
he
hesitated
a
second
must
he
go
down
the
stairs
the
agent
would
follow
in
his
track
the
pursuit
would
develop
for
seeing
a
soldier
in
uniform
racing
along
the
would
join
in
the
running
it
would
be
fatal
vinson
would
be
caught
i
double
back
thought
he
back
and
up
hurriedly
he
mounted
the
next
flight
of
stairs
gaining
the
third
story
no
sooner
had
he
reached
the
landing
which
dominated
flat
than
the
agent
in
his
turn
reached
the
staircase
and
ran
to
the
balustrade
to
try
and
catch
sight
of
vinson
on
his
way
down
to
the
street
he
did
not
doubt
that
this
was
the
soldier
way
of
escape
the
agent
could
not
see
a
soul
got
off
by
jove
he
was
furious
he
was
about
to
descend
when
someone
belonging
to
the
house
probably
began
to
mount
the
first
flight
of
stairs
in
leisurely
fashion
someone
who
could
have
no
suspicion
of
the
pursuit
going
on
in
the
house
very
likely
the
agent
neither
intended
nor
desired
to
be
recognised
for
what
he
was
it
was
quite
probable
that
he
did
not
wish
to
be
seen
for
on
hearing
this
someone
coming
up
towards
him
he
stopped
short
in
his
descent
it
was
his
turn
to
hesitate
a
moment
then
it
suddenly
occurred
to
him
that
this
might
be
a
resident
on
one
of
the
lower
floors
and
so
would
not
come
higher
with
this
the
agent
retraced
his
steps
crossed
the
landing
on
to
which
fandor
flat
opened
and
began
to
mount
the
next
flight
leading
to
the
third
floor
this
did
not
suit
vinson
he
was
on
tenterhooks
if
he
keeps
coming
up
thought
the
corporal
much
use
it
will
be
for
me
to
retreat
upwards
he
will
nip
me
on
the
sixth
floor
it
a
dead
cert
then
he
had
a
brilliant
idea
he
began
to
walk
on
the
landing
with
heavy
steps
imitating
someone
coming
downstairs
forthwith
the
agent
who
was
coming
up
stopped
short
he
had
no
wish
to
be
seen
by
the
person
descending
either
the
only
thing
left
for
him
to
do
was
to
take
refuge
in
the
journalist
flat
easy
enough
with
his
he
reopened
the
door
closing
it
just
in
time
to
escape
being
seen
by
the
resident
coming
upstairs
vinson
who
had
not
lost
a
single
movement
of
the
agent
gave
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
he
had
perfectly
understood
the
why
and
wherefore
of
his
pursuer
hesitations
he
seemed
now
in
high
had
he
not
caught
sight
of
the
new
arrival
he
was
immensely
amused
the
person
who
had
just
come
upstairs
was
now
ringing
fandor
bell
not
getting
any
answer
he
selected
a
key
on
his
bunch
and
it
was
his
turn
to
let
himself
in
to
the
journalist
flat
as
he
was
closing
the
door
corporal
vinson
from
the
landing
above
gave
him
an
ironical
salute
i
much
regret
that
i
am
unable
to
introduce
you
to
each
other
but
by
way
of
return
i
thank
you
for
the
service
you
have
unwittingly
done
me
the
way
was
open
vinson
rapidly
descended
gained
the
street
hailed
a
cab
to
the
eastern
station
i
have
missed
the
express
he
muttered
but
i
shall
catch
the
first
train
for
those
on
leave
whilst
corporal
vinson
was
congratulating
himself
on
the
turn
of
events
the
agent
remained
in
fandor
flat
feeling
as
if
he
were
the
victim
of
an
abominable
nightmare
no
sooner
had
he
hurriedly
let
himself
into
the
flat
in
order
to
escape
the
resident
coming
upstairs
than
he
heard
the
bell
ring
he
felt
desperate
who
the
devil
was
it
assuredly
not
the
unknown
who
had
fled
so
mysteriously
who
then
when
the
bell
rang
a
second
time
the
man
cried
what
to
be
done
well
the
best
thing
was
to
wait
in
the
journalist
study
it
was
more
than
probable
that
not
obtaining
any
response
the
visitor
would
go
away
this
was
not
at
all
what
happened
with
the
same
assurance
which
he
himself
had
had
a
few
minutes
before
the
agent
of
the
second
bureau
heard
the
new
arrival
slip
his
key
into
the
lock
open
the
door
close
it
as
confidently
as
though
he
were
entering
his
own
home
and
now
yes
he
was
coming
towards
the
study
there
was
no
light
burning
in
fandor
study
some
gleams
from
the
in
the
street
dimly
illumined
the
room
the
agent
who
was
leaning
with
his
elbow
on
the
mantelpiece
could
not
clearly
distinguish
the
features
of
the
person
who
now
stood
in
the
doorway
it
was
certainly
not
the
journalist
the
intruder
was
a
man
of
quite
forty
he
wore
a
soft
hat
turned
down
at
the
edges
thus
partially
concealing
the
upper
half
of
his
face
which
was
sunk
in
the
raised
collar
of
an
overcoat
the
intruder
bowed
slightly
to
the
agent
then
taking
a
few
steps
into
the
room
went
to
the
window
looked
about
outside
he
seemed
to
be
someone
on
intimate
terms
with
the
master
of
the
flat
and
might
be
going
to
await
his
return
he
must
be
a
friend
of
jérôme
fandor
thought
the
agent
he
must
think
the
journalist
will
be
here
shortly
perhaps
that
he
is
actually
in
the
flat
somewhere
and
that
i
too
am
waiting
for
him
evidently
the
best
thing
to
do
was
to
stay
where
he
was
and
not
to
make
any
remark
which
might
attract
attention
some
minutes
passed
thus
presently
the
two
men
tired
with
standing
seated
themselves
the
old
boy
will
get
sick
of
waiting
thought
the
agent
he
will
go
away
and
i
shall
take
my
departure
when
he
has
cleared
out
but
the
making
himself
very
much
at
home
now
relieved
himself
of
his
greatcoat
removed
his
hat
and
having
caught
sight
of
a
lamp
on
the
mantelpiece
took
a
box
of
matches
from
his
pocket
and
proceeded
to
light
it
at
the
moment
when
the
match
flared
up
the
man
turning
his
back
on
the
agent
could
not
see
him
but
the
agent
could
see
the
man
distinctly
there
could
be
no
question
that
the
man
lighting
the
lamp
was
someone
the
agent
had
not
expected
to
meet
for
the
emissary
from
the
second
board
did
the
very
reverse
of
what
the
had
done
he
turned
up
the
collar
of
his
greatcoat
the
two
men
were
now
face
to
face
in
the
lighted
room
there
was
a
silence
which
lasted
some
minutes
the
agent
broke
it
you
await
monsieur
fandor
asked
the
agent
yes
monsieur
and
you
also
no
doubt
quite
so
and
i
have
more
than
an
idea
that
we
shall
have
to
wait
a
long
time
for
him
i
saw
him
a
short
while
ago
he
had
a
piece
of
pressing
business
on
hand
and
i
do
not
think
he
will
be
back
the
agent
was
quite
obviously
trying
to
get
the
to
retire
bah
retorted
the
latter
i
am
in
no
hurry
whilst
speaking
the
unknown
visitor
stared
strangely
at
the
emissary
of
the
second
bureau
he
was
thinking
where
have
i
seen
that
long
beard
that
remarkably
heavy
moustache
and
then
this
bundle
he
has
put
down
if
i
am
not
jolly
well
mistaken
i
know
this
individual
well
now
he
said
pleasantly
since
chance
has
thrown
us
into
each
other
company
allow
me
to
introduce
myself
monsieur
i
am
brigadier
juve
of
the
detective
force
from
police
headquarters
in
that
case
we
might
almost
count
ourselves
colleagues
monsieur
i
am
the
agent
vagualame
attached
to
the
vigilance
department
of
the
secret
service
with
that
vagualame
held
out
his
hand
to
his
colleague
juve
it
was
done
with
an
unmistakable
air
of
constraint
it
really
seemed
as
if
juve
had
been
awaiting
this
very
action
for
at
the
precise
moment
vagualame
held
out
his
hand
the
detective
extended
his
and
prolonged
the
as
if
he
never
meant
to
let
go
a
regular
juve
was
thinking
hard
vagualame
here
is
this
vagualame
at
fandor
significant
and
then
no
there
no
doubt
about
it
this
beard
is
false
that
moustache
is
artificial
this
individual
is
made
up
perceiving
that
he
was
face
to
face
with
a
disguised
man
juve
was
about
to
hurl
himself
on
this
masquerader
when
that
individual
forestalling
the
detective
movement
seized
the
initiative
with
lightning
rapidity
he
tore
his
hand
from
juve
tenacious
grip
bounded
to
the
mantelpiece
threw
down
the
lamp
with
a
jerk
of
his
elbow
thrust
juve
violently
aside
and
rushed
to
the
door
like
lightning
juve
tore
off
in
pursuit
the
masquerader
had
the
advantage
by
some
yards
banging
door
after
door
in
juve
face
he
rushed
towards
the
entrance
hall
gained
the
staircase
racing
down
it
by
leaps
and
bounds
four
steps
at
a
time
juve
at
his
heels
risked
breaking
his
neck
in
hot
pursuit
vagualame
reached
the
porch
of
the
house
door
juve
was
close
on
his
quarry
i
shall
get
him
thought
juve
in
the
street
the
people
will
lend
me
a
helping
hand
vagualame
fled
through
the
doorway
in
passing
he
seized
the
massive
door
and
pulled
it
to
with
a
resounding
bang
juve
borne
forward
by
the
impetus
of
his
dashing
pursuit
staggered
backwards
and
rolled
to
the
ground
instantly
juve
sprang
to
the
porter
lodge
and
demanded
the
string
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
and
juve
was
out
in
the
street
he
was
furious
he
was
breathless
the
whole
length
of
the
pavements
not
a
soul
was
in
sight
vagualame
had
vanished
taking
advantage
of
the
fact
that
fandor
concierge
knew
him
well
and
was
aware
of
his
standing
as
an
officer
of
the
detective
force
juve
after
having
explained
in
a
few
words
to
the
honest
creature
the
cause
of
the
commotion
mounted
to
fandor
flat
once
more
what
the
deuce
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
he
was
asking
himself
two
hours
ago
fandor
telephones
me
that
he
must
see
me
on
a
matter
of
the
utmost
urgency
he
telephones
me
that
he
can
not
go
out
that
he
is
waiting
for
me
and
now
not
only
is
he
not
here
but
i
stumble
on
an
agent
from
the
second
bureau
i
encounter
a
vagualame
disguised
who
runs
as
if
all
the
devils
of
hell
were
after
him
who
makes
off
with
extraordinary
agility
whose
presence
of
mind
in
burking
pursuit
is
marvellous
who
is
this
fellow
what
was
he
up
to
in
fandor
flat
where
is
fandor
our
detective
had
just
the
journalist
study
there
on
the
floor
lay
the
bundle
which
had
excited
his
curiosity
when
vagualame
was
present
the
enemy
thought
he
has
retired
but
has
abandoned
his
baggage
juve
relighted
the
lamp
and
undid
the
black
serge
covering
of
the
bundle
ah
i
might
have
guessed
as
much
it
is
an
accordion
accordion
mechanically
turning
and
returning
the
instrument
of
music
juve
slipped
his
hands
into
the
leather
holders
wishing
to
relax
the
bellows
which
were
at
full
stretch
to
his
surprise
the
bellows
resisted
why
there
must
be
something
inside
the
accordion
he
exclaimed
juve
drew
from
his
pocket
a
dagger
knife
and
slit
open
the
bellows
with
one
sharp
cut
something
black
fell
out
a
piece
of
stuff
juve
picked
it
up
spread
it
out
and
considered
it
he
grew
pale
as
he
looked
staggered
like
a
drunken
man
and
sank
on
a
chair
overcome
what
he
held
in
his
hand
was
a
hooded
cloak
long
and
black
such
as
italian
bandits
wear
a
species
of
mask
sunk
in
his
chair
his
eyes
staring
at
this
sinister
garment
juve
seemed
to
see
rising
before
him
a
form
at
once
mysterious
and
clearly
defined
the
form
of
an
unknown
man
enveloped
in
this
cloak
as
in
a
sheath
his
face
hidden
by
the
hooded
mask
disguised
by
just
such
a
cloak
as
he
had
exposed
to
view
when
he
slashed
open
the
bellows
of
this
accordion
this
form
mysterious
nameless
tragic
thus
evoked
juve
had
rarely
seen
but
each
time
that
figure
in
hooded
black
had
appeared
it
was
in
circumstances
so
serious
under
conditions
so
tragic
that
it
was
graven
on
his
memory
graven
beyond
mistake
graven
ineffaceably
had
not
juve
been
haunted
by
this
form
this
figure
so
mysteriously
indicated
haunted
by
this
invisible
face
hidden
by
its
hooded
cloak
of
black
haunted
for
years
never
had
he
been
able
to
get
close
to
it
never
had
he
been
able
to
seize
it
in
his
hands
outstretched
to
grasp
it
whenever
this
sinister
garment
had
met
his
eyes
it
had
been
the
sign
of
some
frightful
deception
he
did
not
know
the
countenance
it
masked
so
darkly
but
that
same
cloak
he
knew
so
well
did
he
know
it
that
never
could
he
confuse
it
with
another
hooded
cloak
of
black
never
its
shape
was
peculiar
its
cut
singular
unmistakable
it
was
the
impenetrable
mask
of
one
of
those
counterfeit
personalities
assumed
at
the
pleasure
of
that
enigmatic
sinister
formidable
bandit
whom
juve
had
pursued
for
ten
years
without
cessation
without
mercy
there
had
been
no
truce
to
this
hunting
now
he
turned
and
returned
this
cloak
of
dark
significance
with
trembling
hands
as
if
he
would
tear
its
secret
from
its
sinister
folds
this
hooded
cloak
which
his
knife
had
revealed
which
he
had
torn
from
its
hiding
place
in
the
accordion
of
vagualame
was
none
other
than
the
cloak
of
fantômas
suddenly
there
was
brought
home
to
juve
the
comprehension
of
all
this
adventure
signified
a
distracting
a
maddening
adventure
fantômas
fantômas
juve
murmured
great
heavens
i
saw
fantômas
before
me
vagualame
he
is
fantômas
curse
it
he
has
slipped
through
my
hands
thrice
fool
that
i
am
never
again
will
he
appear
as
this
beggarly
accordion
player
never
will
he
dare
to
show
himself
in
that
what
new
form
will
he
take
fantômas
fantômas
once
again
you
have
escaped
me
our
detective
remained
in
fandor
flat
all
night
he
awaited
the
journalist
return
fandor
did
not
come
xii
a
trick
according
to
fandor
it
was
a
november
sunday
evening
a
crowd
of
soldiers
were
entraining
at
the
eastern
station
they
would
be
dropped
at
their
respective
garrisons
along
the
line
of
some
kilometres
separating
the
capital
from
the
frontier
they
had
dined
supped
feasted
with
friends
and
relatives
now
they
were
voicing
regretful
farewells
by
medley
of
songs
and
serenades
they
scrambled
into
the
compartments
fifteen
sixteen
at
a
time
filling
the
seats
and
overflowing
on
to
the
floor
little
by
little
the
deafening
din
of
the
wild
beasts
as
they
were
jokingly
called
diminished
their
enthusiasm
died
down
as
the
night
advanced
while
the
train
rushed
full
steam
ahead
for
the
frontier
of
france
they
fell
asleep
knowing
that
kind
comrades
would
awaken
them
when
the
train
drew
up
at
their
various
garrisons
at
reims
the
compartments
disgorged
the
dragoons
at
châlons
so
many
gunners
and
infantry
had
got
out
that
the
train
was
half
emptied
at
a
large
contingent
of
cuirassiers
and
infantry
had
cleared
out
towards
four
in
the
morning
the
express
was
nearing
verdun
as
the
train
steamed
out
of
a
corporal
of
the
line
who
had
been
forced
to
sit
up
as
stiff
as
a
poker
for
several
hours
stretched
himself
at
length
on
the
compartment
seat
with
a
sigh
of
relief
but
the
jerks
and
jolts
of
the
carriage
the
hard
seat
made
sleep
impossible
the
epaulettes
of
his
uniform
were
an
added
source
of
discomfort
the
corporal
sat
up
rubbed
the
musty
glass
of
the
window
and
watched
for
the
coming
day
on
the
far
horizon
beyond
a
shadowy
stretch
of
country
a
pallid
dawn
was
breaking
trees
were
swaying
in
a
gusty
wind
at
intervals
when
the
clatter
of
the
onrushing
train
lessened
the
heavy
pattering
of
rain
on
the
roof
became
audible
confound
it
growled
the
corporal
detestable
weather
hateful
country
whilst
attempting
some
muscular
exercises
to
unstiffen
his
aching
limbs
he
muttered
and
only
to
think
of
that
wretch
vinson
enjoying
the
benefit
of
my
permit
started
off
under
my
name
and
is
now
rolling
along
in
a
comfortable
towards
the
sunny
south
with
a
nice
bit
of
money
in
his
purse
the
corporal
in
the
inhospitable
of
the
verdun
train
made
mental
pictures
of
vinson
progress
south
he
talked
to
himself
aloud
good
journey
to
you
you
jolly
dog
in
six
weeks
time
if
you
have
a
thought
to
spare
for
me
you
will
send
your
news
as
we
arranged
the
corporal
began
breathing
warm
breaths
on
his
numbed
fingers
by
jove
the
company
is
not
prodigal
of
that
certain
it
an
in
here
he
continued
to
soliloquise
it
a
deuce
of
a
risky
business
i
have
let
myself
in
for
to
take
vinson
place
and
set
off
for
verdun
where
his
regiment
is
doing
garrison
duty
the
regiment
to
which
he
has
just
been
attached
it
would
run
as
smooth
as
oil
if
i
had
done
my
military
service
but
owing
to
circumstances
i
have
never
been
called
up
a
pretty
sort
of
fool
i
may
make
of
myself
after
a
reflective
silence
he
went
on
bah
i
shall
pull
through
all
right
have
i
not
crammed
my
head
with
theory
the
last
eight
days
and
pumped
vinson
for
all
he
was
worth
about
the
rules
and
regulations
and
the
ways
of
camp
life
all
the
same
to
make
my
début
in
an
eastern
garrison
in
the
division
straight
off
the
reel
takes
some
nerve
what
cheek
it
the
limit
but
my
dear
little
fandor
do
forget
you
are
at
verdun
not
to
play
the
complete
soldier
but
to
gather
exact
information
about
a
band
of
traitors
and
to
unmask
them
at
the
first
opportunity
a
work
of
national
importance
little
fandor
and
you
forget
it
thus
our
adventurous
lay
shivering
in
the
night
train
on
the
point
of
drawing
up
at
verdun
having
saved
the
wretched
vinson
from
suicide
fandor
had
made
him
promise
to
leave
france
and
await
developments
whilst
fandor
posing
as
vinson
studied
at
close
quarters
the
spies
who
had
drawn
the
miserable
corporal
into
their
net
fandor
could
personate
vinson
with
every
chance
of
success
because
the
of
the
line
had
never
set
eyes
on
the
corporal
after
a
week
of
perplexity
fandor
had
come
to
a
decision
the
previous
night
wishing
to
let
his
dear
master
know
of
his
audacious
project
he
had
telephoned
to
juve
on
the
sunday
evening
to
ask
him
to
come
to
the
flat
then
vagualame
had
appeared
on
the
scene
fandor
knew
him
to
be
an
agent
of
the
second
bureau
evidently
vagualame
was
after
vinson
if
fandor
had
let
himself
be
caught
in
the
corporal
uniform
which
he
had
just
put
on
his
spy
plans
would
have
been
ruined
and
the
corporal
to
whom
he
had
promised
his
protection
would
have
been
caught
fandor
fled
the
situation
would
have
to
be
made
clear
when
opportunity
offered
certainly
said
fandor
to
himself
with
a
smile
things
are
pretty
well
mixed
up
at
present
that
meeting
between
vagualame
and
juve
at
the
flat
must
have
been
a
queer
one
two
birds
of
a
feather
though
differing
in
glory
who
would
not
make
head
or
tail
of
so
unexpected
a
conference
to
clear
up
the
imbroglio
fandor
had
meant
to
send
juve
a
wire
on
his
arrival
at
verdun
on
second
thoughts
he
had
decided
against
it
probably
the
spies
or
the
second
bureau
or
both
were
keeping
a
sharp
watch
on
vinson
it
would
be
wiser
to
refrain
from
any
communication
which
might
reveal
the
fact
that
the
corporal
vinson
who
joined
the
of
the
line
at
verdun
was
none
other
than
jérôme
fandor
journalist
though
stiff
with
cold
and
fatigue
fandor
brain
was
clear
and
active
it
is
all
right
juve
would
be
surprised
anxious
would
make
enquiries
at
the
company
offices
would
learn
that
on
the
sunday
evening
fandor
had
occupied
the
place
reserved
for
him
in
the
would
be
reassured
would
not
worry
about
abrupt
departure
and
silence
fandor
was
holiday
making
yes
it
is
all
right
reiterated
fandor
what
i
have
to
do
is
to
throw
myself
wholeheartedly
into
my
part
and
play
it
as
jovially
as
possible
the
train
whistled
slowed
down
entered
the
station
of
verdun
fandor
let
the
crowd
of
soldiers
precede
him
as
well
as
one
or
two
civilians
whom
the
night
express
had
brought
to
this
important
frontier
fortress
having
readjusted
his
coat
the
fringes
of
his
epaulettes
and
put
on
his
cap
correctly
this
corporal
of
the
line
stepped
on
to
the
platform
reached
the
exit
passed
out
on
to
a
vast
flat
space
and
found
himself
floundering
in
a
sea
of
mud
the
men
who
had
arrived
with
him
had
hurried
off
fandor
was
alone
on
the
outskirts
of
the
silent
town
what
to
do
which
way
to
go
under
the
flame
of
a
struggling
against
the
onslaughts
of
the
wind
fandor
caught
sight
of
the
honest
face
of
a
constable
enveloped
in
a
thick
hooded
coat
he
eyed
fandor
excuse
me
said
corporal
rolling
his
r
in
imitation
of
a
rustic
fresh
from
the
country
but
could
you
tell
me
where
i
shall
find
the
of
the
line
what
do
you
want
with
the
of
the
line
queried
the
constable
it
is
like
this
monsieur
i
was
in
the
garrisoned
at
châlons
i
have
had
eight
days
leave
and
they
inform
me
i
am
attached
to
the
the
constable
nodded
and
now
you
want
to
get
to
your
new
regiment
precisely
well
the
is
in
three
places
at
bastion
at
the
saint
benoit
barracks
and
at
fort
vieux
which
are
you
bound
for
corporal
i
do
know
i
no
preference
murmured
corporal
the
two
men
stood
staring
at
each
other
in
the
rain
despite
the
chill
and
melancholy
dawn
with
its
darkly
reddening
skies
fandor
felt
he
was
on
the
very
verge
of
bursting
into
wild
laughter
let
us
see
your
route
instructions
quoth
the
constable
corporal
showed
his
paper
that
it
cried
the
constable
triumphantly
you
are
down
to
report
yourself
at
the
saint
benoit
barracks
you
in
luck
my
lad
only
fifty
yards
or
so
from
here
go
down
the
road
and
you
will
see
the
barrack
wall
on
the
left
the
entrance
is
in
the
middle
fandor
saluted
the
friendly
constable
hurried
off
and
reached
the
saint
benoit
gate
in
a
few
minutes
the
he
asked
the
sentry
here
you
will
find
the
sergeant
in
the
fandor
entered
a
room
several
soldiers
were
stretched
at
full
length
on
a
bench
slumbering
a
snoring
officer
was
lying
on
three
straw
bottomed
chairs
close
to
a
stove
at
fandor
entrance
he
was
wide
awake
in
a
moment
he
swore
it
was
the
sergeant
what
do
you
want
he
demanded
roughly
adopting
a
military
manner
fandor
announced
corporal
vinson
just
arrived
from
châlons
exchanged
from
the
sergeant
ah
quite
so
wait
i
will
show
you
your
company
stretching
himself
the
sergeant
marched
to
the
end
of
the
room
turned
up
a
opened
a
book
looked
through
the
pages
slowly
his
finger
stopped
at
a
name
orderly
a
man
presented
himself
conduct
corporal
vinson
to
a
block
second
floor
turning
to
fandor
the
sergeant
informed
him
you
are
attached
to
the
third
of
the
second
while
plodding
through
the
mud
of
the
courtyard
fandor
said
to
himself
the
third
of
the
second
means
i
suppose
that
i
have
the
honour
of
belonging
to
the
third
company
of
the
second
battalion
fandor
gazed
with
lively
curiosity
at
the
immense
building
in
which
he
was
to
pass
his
days
and
nights
for
he
did
not
know
how
long
a
time
as
he
scrutinised
this
enormous
pile
standing
harsh
and
stark
in
its
uncompromising
and
ordered
strength
as
he
took
stock
of
the
vast
courtyards
and
the
stony
lengths
of
imprisoning
walls
he
got
an
idea
of
that
formidable
organisation
called
a
regiment
which
itself
is
but
an
infinitesimal
part
of
that
great
whole
we
call
an
army
appreciating
as
he
now
did
the
importance
the
immutability
the
regularity
of
the
movements
of
the
military
machine
with
its
wheels
within
wheels
fandor
asked
himself
if
it
were
possible
to
carry
through
the
programme
he
had
drawn
up
for
himself
could
he
at
one
and
the
same
time
trick
the
french
army
and
save
it
he
had
taken
his
precautions
he
had
read
and
reread
vinson
manual
now
manual
mentally
he
had
put
himself
in
the
skin
of
a
corporal
he
was
letter
perfect
and
now
he
must
cover
himself
with
the
mantle
of
vinson
for
the
greater
glory
of
france
he
could
not
help
laughing
when
he
read
the
list
of
his
facial
characteristics
chin
round
nose
medium
face
oval
eyes
grey
vague
enough
this
to
be
safe
fandor
hair
was
dark
chestnut
vinson
was
brown
vinson
and
fandor
were
sufficiently
alike
as
to
height
and
figure
besides
soldiers
uniforms
were
not
an
exact
fit
here
you
are
corporal
announced
the
orderly
he
pointed
to
a
vast
room
at
the
end
of
a
corridor
the
bugle
had
just
sounded
the
reveille
and
the
was
humming
like
a
hive
of
awakened
bees
the
orderly
had
vanished
fandor
stood
at
the
threshold
hesitating
his
had
gone
down
with
a
run
it
was
a
momentary
lapse
pulling
himself
together
he
walked
into
the
room
when
giving
him
his
instructions
vinson
had
warned
fandor
that
when
it
came
to
settling
down
in
barracks
he
would
find
nothing
to
hand
among
other
little
items
your
bed
will
be
missing
as
corporal
you
have
a
right
to
round
on
them
row
them
hot
and
good
start
reprisals
straight
away
the
men
will
pretend
not
to
understand
but
insist
do
take
no
for
an
answer
take
whatever
you
want
right
and
left
in
the
end
you
will
get
properly
settled
in
fandor
carried
out
these
instructions
before
he
had
been
ten
minutes
in
the
room
men
were
rushing
in
all
directions
fussing
jostling
one
another
coming
going
demanding
of
all
the
echoes

xiii
juve
stratagem
whilst
jérôme
fandor
was
commencing
his
apprenticeship
as
a
soldier
at
the
saint
benoit
barracks
verdun
a
sordid
individual
was
following
an
elegant
pedestrian
who
descending
the
rue
solférino
went
in
the
direction
of
the
seine
it
was
about
seven
in
the
evening
pstt
this
sound
issued
from
the
ragged
individual
but
the
did
not
turn
his
head
monsieur
insisted
the
sordid
one
as
the
elegant
pedestrian
did
not
seem
to
know
he
was
being
followed
the
sordid
individual
stepped
to
his
side
and
murmured
in
his
white
beard
distinctly
enough
to
be
heard
lieutenant
do
listen
look
here
monsieur
de
loubersac
henri
the
young
man
turned
he
gave
the
importunate
speaker
a
withering
stare
he
was
furious
the
speaker
was
vagualame
i
shall
fine
you
five
hundred
francs
how
dare
you
accost
me
like
this
are
you
mad
de
loubersac
voice
shook
with
rage
lieutenant
de
loubersac
had
just
quitted
the
second
bureau
after
an
unusually
hard
day
work
fatigued
by
the
offices
he
was
enjoying
the
fresh
air
and
exercise
in
spite
of
the
chilling
mist
overhanging
paris
when
his
thoughts
were
not
connected
on
his
work
he
would
dwell
tenderly
on
every
little
detail
of
his
meetings
with
pretty
mademoiselle
de
naarboveck
had
she
not
given
him
permission
to
call
her
wilhelmine
and
did
he
not
cherish
the
hope
of
soon
making
her
his
wife
but
this
vagualame
was
insupportable
that
he
should
dare
to
accost
him
without
observing
the
customary
precautions
hail
him
by
his
style
and
title
in
a
most
public
thoroughfare
so
imprudently
compromise
himself
and
an
attaché
of
the
second
bureau
well
he
knew
how
to
attack
informers
and
such
gentry
in
their
most
vulnerable
spot
their
purse
hence
the
fine
of
five
hundred
francs
he
had
imposed
on
vagualame
the
old
fellow
shuffled
along
beside
the
enraged
lieutenant
whining
complaining
of
the
precarious
state
of
his
finances
but
de
loubersac
was
adamant
perceiving
this
vagualame
desisted
i
want
to
talk
to
you
said
he
suggested
de
loubersac
no
at
once
it
is
urgent
de
loubersac
could
hardly
hear
what
vagualame
said
twice
he
cried
in
an
irritated
voice
what
is
the
matter
with
you
i
can
not
understand
what
you
say
i
can
hardly
hear
you
i
have
a
severe
cold
on
the
chest
lieutenant
certainly
vagualame
voice
was
remarkably
hoarse
if
the
government
does
not
give
me
something
regular
to
live
on
i
shall
die
in
hospital
de
loubersac
looked
about
him
anxiously
if
his
colonel
should
catch
sight
of
him
conferring
with
an
agent
so
near
the
headquarters
of
the
second
bureau
he
would
incur
a
sharp
reprimand
the
interview
must
take
place
therefore
they
must
conceal
themselves
vagualame
as
though
reading
the
lieutenant
thought
pointed
to
the
steep
flight
of
steps
leading
to
the
banks
of
the
seine
let
us
go
down
by
the
river
we
shall
be
undisturbed
there
de
loubersac
acquiesced
so
the
smart
young
officer
and
the
old
beggar
in
his
ragged
coat
with
the
accordion
hanging
over
his
shoulder
who
might
have
been
mistaken
for
quasimodo
himself
descended
the
steps
in
company
vagualame
eyes
gleamed
with
joy
they
were
piercing
eyes
full
of
life
and
intelligence
not
the
fierce
furtive
eyes
of
vagualame
for
this
vagualame
was
juve
the
day
following
the
famous
evening
he
had
passed
in
fandor
flat
juve
as
we
know
had
discovered
that
vagualame
agent
of
the
second
bureau
was
cleverly
disguised
and
was
none
other
than
fantômas
juve
appropriated
the
accordion
left
by
the
fleeing
bandit
juve
also
decided
to
personate
vagualame
and
spy
on
the
various
persons
who
had
relations
with
this
sinister
being
as
far
as
juve
was
concerned
was
done
for
therefore
it
was
highly
improbable
that
the
criminal
daring
to
the
last
degree
though
he
was
would
show
himself
in
his
vagualame
guise
for
some
time
to
come
therefore
juve
must
act
at
once
his
first
move
must
be
to
meet
and
talk
with
the
second
bureau
officer
most
in
touch
with
vagualame
and
make
him
talk
without
arousing
his
suspicions
juve
also
meant
to
mix
with
vagualame
associates
trusting
to
luck
and
his
own
perspicacity
to
get
on
to
various
trails
trails
that
would
lead
him
to
the
solution
of
grave
problems
juve
had
felt
anxious
as
he
accosted
de
loubersac
no
doubt
the
lieutenant
and
his
secret
agent
had
some
set
form
of
greeting
some
agreed
on
method
of
imparting
information
by
incurring
the
fine
juve
realised
that
he
had
made
a
wrong
start
perhaps
omitted
a
password
still
he
had
obtained
the
essential
thing
a
private
talk
with
this
particular
official
of
the
second
bureau
the
talk
began
with
an
abrupt
question
from
de
loubersac
and
the
v
affair
the
v
affair
peuh
what
the
deuce
does
he
refer
to
juve
was
asking
himself
unsuspecting
de
loubersac
came
to
his
aid
our
corporal
must
have
returned
to
verdun
ah
thought
juve
our
corporal
is
vinson
the
further
he
proceeded
in
his
present
investigations
the
clearer
grew
the
connection
between
the
brocq
affair
and
those
of
bobinette
wilhelmine
de
loubersac
surely
they
were
all
interpreters
of
the
tragic
drama
conceived
by
his
leave
expired
this
morning
continued
de
loubersac
he
left
yesterday
evening
i
have
proof
of
it
asserted
anything
new
not
so
far
are
you
going
to
verdun
possibly
how
about
the
document
hum
murmured
here
was
another
conundrum
he
must
go
warily
you
are
constantly
looking
for
it
of
course
you
know
it
is
the
most
urgent
of
all
juve
nodded
agreement
place
it
in
my
hands
and
i
shall
give
you
fifty
thousand
francs
in
exchange
for
it
you
know
that
less
the
fine
put
in
with
a
comical
grimace
de
loubersac
smiled
we
will
speak
of
that
again
there
was
a
pause
a
good
deal
has
happened
since
the
death
of
captain
mistress
remarked
is
captain
brocq
mistress
dead
too
poor
girl
de
loubersac
stared
hard
at
the
accordion
player
oh
come
now
vagualame
where
are
your
wits
wits
lieutenant
echoed
there
is
no
lieutenant
i
tell
you
cried
de
loubersac
with
a
stamp
of
his
foot
it
is
monsieur
henri
just
henri
if
you
like
how
many
more
times
am
i
to
tell
you
this
reply
was
an
equivocal
gesture
you
do
not
know
about
the
châlons
affair
the
assassination
of
the
singer
nichoune
no
that
is
to
well
then
de
loubersac
was
staring
at
vagualame
with
puzzled
eyes
well
then
as
to
that
no
i
had
better
hold
my
tongue
speak
out
commanded
de
loubersac
no
growled
i
order
you
to
do
so
well
then
conceded
since
you
must
know
what
i
think
i
consider
nichoune
was
in
no
sense
the
mistress
of
captain
brocq
they
found
letters
from
captain
brocq
on
her
de
loubersac
laugh
had
a
sneer
in
it
bah
said
the
old
accordion
player
punctuating
his
remark
with
some
piercing
sounds
from
his
ancient
instrument
of
discordant
music
it
was
a
business
what
is
that
you
say
objected
de
loubersac
after
a
reflection
he
added
but
of
course
you
must
know
more
about
it
than
anyone
vagualame
because
you
saw
her
just
before
the
end
did
you
have
a
talk
with
nichoune
on
the
friday
the
eve
of
her
death
was
about
to
speak
de
loubersac
added
the
innkeeper
saw
you
did
he
now
what
is
this
thought
juve
this
statement
opened
up
a
fresh
view
of
things
de
loubersac
did
not
give
him
time
for
reflection
who
then
do
you
think
killed
nichoune
juve
would
not
for
the
world
voice
his
suspicions
just
then
with
a
at
the
lieutenant
he
remarked
faith
what
i
am
inclined
to
think
is
that
the
guilty
person
is
that
aunt
palmyra
aunt
palmyra
repeated
de
loubersac
decidedly
my
poor
vagualame
you
are
stupid
as
an
owl
well
there
is
no
harm
in
telling
you
this
aunt
palmyra
was
one
of
my
colleagues
i
suspected
as
much
thought
juve
but
i
wanted
him
to
confirm
it
de
loubersac
was
again
the
questioner
vagualame
you
spoke
just
now
of
brocq
mistress
if
as
you
seem
to
think
nichoune
had
no
such
relation
with
the
captain
where
are
we
to
look
for
his
mistress
hah
look
in
another
direction
among
his
friends
in
the
great
world
the
diplomatic
set
for
preference
think
of
those
in
the
de
naarboveck
look
out
vagualame
exclaimed
de
loubersac
weigh
your
words
well
do
not
be
afraid
lieu
pardon
monsieur
henri
perhaps
you
think
it
is
bobinette
queried
de
loubersac
no
who
then
juve
shot
his
answer
at
the
lieutenant
like
a
stone
from
a
catapult
wilhelmine
de
naarboveck
a
shout
of
indignant
protest
burst
from
de
loubersac
he
could
not
contain
his
fury
he
kicked
the
supposed
vagualame
with
such
force
that
he
sent
him
rolling
in
the
greasy
mud
of
the
seine
bank
beast
growled
juve
as
he
picked
himself
up
if
i
were
not
vagualame
i
should
know
how
to
answer
him
he
muttered
as
it
is
juve
rose
stumbling
and
staggering
like
a
badly
shaken
old
man
and
leaned
against
the
hand
railing
of
the
steps
meanwhile
de
loubersac
was
walking
up
and
down
talking
aloud
in
a
state
of
extreme
agitation
disgusting
creatures
wretches
degrading
occupation
they
respect
nothing
and
no
one
insinuating
such
abominations
wilhelmine
de
naarboveck
the
mistress
of
brocq
how
vile
loathsome
creatures
it
was
now
obvious
to
the
alert
juve
who
drank
in
every
word
each
gesture
of
de
loubersac
that
the
enraged
lieutenant
adored
wilhelmine
no
doubt
on
that
score
when
de
loubersac
had
calmed
down
somewhat
juve
cried
softly
oh
monsieur
henri
roused
from
his
reflections
de
loubersac
shouted
hold
your
tongue
you
sicken
me
but
insisted
i
have
only
done
my
duty
if
i
spoke
as
i
did
it
was
because
my
have
you
got
consciences
your
sort
cried
de
loubersac
casting
a
glance
of
withering
contempt
at
the
supposed
old
man
there
was
a
silence
then
de
loubersac
walked
up
to
the
old
accordion
player
and
asked
anxiously
can
you
give
me
proofs
of
the
truth
of
what
you
have
just
asserted
perhaps
was
the
evasive
answer
you
will
have
to
give
me
proofs
insisted
de
loubersac
proofs
i
have
none
replied
the
mysterious
old
fellow
but
i
have
intuitions
better
still
my
confidence
is
grounded
on
a
strong
probability
this
statement
came
to
de
loubersac
with
the
force
of
a
stunning
blow
it
came
from
one
whom
he
considered
his
best
agent
he
knew
vagualame
always
weighed
his
words
his
information
was
generally
correct
we
can
not
continue
this
conversation
here
he
said
we
must
meet
as
usual
and
remember
do
not
attempt
to
accost
me
without
using
the
password
now
how
the
deuce
am
i
to
know
what
this
famous
word
is
juve
asked
himself
then
he
had
an
inspiration
we
must
not
use
it
again
he
announced
i
have
reason
to
think
our
customary
password
is
known
i
will
explain
another
time
it
is
a
regular
story
a
long
one
all
right
agreed
de
loubersac
what
should
it
be
suppose
i
say
i
will
answer
said
agreed
de
loubersac
rapidly
mounted
the
steps
leading
to
the
quay
glad
to
close
a
detestable
interview
remained
below
he
struck
his
forehead
monsieur
henri
he
called
what
the
meeting
place
de
loubersac
had
just
signalled
to
a
taxi
he
leaned
over
the
parapet
and
called
to
who
had
got
no
farther
than
the
middle
of
the
steps
why
at
half
past
three
in
the
garden
as
usual
oh
ho
said
the
old
accordion
player
he
will
be
furious
i
shall
play
him
false
bound
to
for
how
can
i
keep
the
appointment
confound
it
what
garden
whereabouts
in
it
then
as
he
regained
the
quay
juve
laughed
in
his
false
white
beard
what
do
i
care
i
snap
my
fingers
at
that
rendezvous
i
have
extracted
from
him
what
i
wanted
to
know
it
matters
not
a
jot
if
i
never
set
eyes
on
him
again
and
now
it
is
we
two
bobinette
xiv
before
a
tomb
this
is
a
surprise
mademoiselle
de
naarboveck
stopped
she
smiled
up
at
henri
de
loubersac
do
you
know
i
saw
in
this
glass
that
you
were
following
us
she
said
pointing
to
a
mirror
placed
at
an
angle
in
a
confectioner
shop
at
the
corner
of
rue
biot
these
artless
remarks
put
the
handsome
lieutenant
out
of
countenance
he
blushed
hotly
but
he
pressed
the
little
hand
held
out
to
him
so
simply
and
with
such
a
look
of
frank
pleasure
he
stammered
some
excuse
for
not
having
recognised
her
he
bowed
pleasantly
to
wilhelmine
companion
mademoiselle
berthe
wilhelmine
turned
to
her
this
meeting
was
not
prearranged
it
is
one
of
pure
chance
the
tone
was
defensive
without
a
touch
of
the
apologetic
mademoiselle
berthe
smiled
and
declared
that
she
had
not
for
a
moment
supposed
that
the
meeting
had
been
prearranged
de
loubersac
gazed
considerably
at
the
two
girls
wilhelmine
was
looking
particularly
pretty
beneath
her
fur
toque
shone
masses
of
her
pale
gold
hair
framing
a
charming
little
face
a
long
velvet
coat
with
ermine
stole
suggested
the
youthful
contours
of
her
slender
figure
mademoiselle
berthe
wore
rough
blue
cloth
and
a
large
hat
trimmed
with
wings
which
set
off
her
piquant
face
with
its
irregular
features
and
ruddy
locks
wilhelmine
and
henri
de
loubersac
strolled
on
together
in
the
direction
of
the
hippodrome
mutual
protestations
of
love
were
exchanged
presently
wilhelmine
asked
but
what
brought
you
in
this
direction
oh
i
was
going
to
pay
a
visit
it
is
a
piece
of
very
good
luck
my
coming
across
you
like
this
de
loubersac
seemed
to
have
something
on
his
mind
despite
his
protestations
he
did
not
look
as
if
he
were
enjoying
this
chance
meeting
where
were
you
bound
for
wilhelmine
he
asked
she
looked
up
at
her
lover
with
sad
eyes
pointing
in
the
direction
of
the
cemetery
of
montemartre
she
replied
in
a
low
tone
i
am
going
to
visit
the
dear
dead
would
you
allow
me
to
accompany
you
begged
de
loubersac
wilhelmine
shook
her
head
i
must
ask
you
to
allow
me
to
go
there
alone
it
is
my
custom
to
pray
there
without
witnesses
de
loubersac
turned
towards
mademoiselle
berthe
with
a
questioning
look
a
gesture
of
interrogation
wilhelmine
replied
to
it
as
a
rule
i
go
to
the
cemetery
alone
you
see
me
with
my
companion
because
my
father
wished
it
since
the
sad
affair
which
has
thrown
a
shadow
over
our
life
he
is
in
a
constant
state
of
anxiety
about
my
safety
he
does
not
wish
me
to
go
about
unaccompanied
i
shall
be
waited
for
at
the
cemetery
wilhelmine
candid
eyes
gazed
at
de
loubersac
who
was
gnawing
his
moustache
with
a
preoccupied
air
what
is
the
matter
henri
she
asked
de
loubersac
came
closer
to
wilhelmine
grew
red
as
fire
and
without
daring
to
look
her
in
the
face
burst
out
listen
wilhelmine
i
would
rather
tell
you
everything
oh
you
are
going
to
think
badly
of
me
the
truth
is
our
meeting
is
not
accidental
it
is
of
set
purpose
on
my
part
for
the
last
two
days
i
have
been
worried
preoccupied
jealous
i
am
afraid
of
not
being
loved
by
you
as
i
love
you
afraid
that
there
is
or
was
something
between
us
dividing
us
wilhelmine
looked
at
her
lover
with
the
eyes
of
an
astonished
child
i
do
not
understand
you
she
murmured
mastering
his
emotion
de
loubersac
decided
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
i
will
be
frank
wilhelmine
your
last
words
have
increased
my
torture
have
you
not
spoken
of
dear
dead
and
must
i
learn
that
you
are
perhaps
going
to
pray
at
the
tomb
of
captain
brocq
more
and
more
astonished
wilhelmine
replied
and
suppose
i
were
going
to
do
so
should
i
be
doing
wrong
to
pray
for
the
repose
of
the
soul
of
the
unfortunate
captain
brocq
who
was
one
of
my
best
friends
ah
cried
henri
de
loubersac
is
it
love
you
feel
for
him
then
he
looked
so
despairing
that
wilhelmine
offended
hurt
though
she
was
by
her
lover
suspicions
pitied
his
anguish
and
reassured
him
if
you
had
been
following
me
for
some
time
past
you
would
have
seen
that
i
have
been
in
the
habit
of
going
to
this
cemetery
have
gone
there
regularly
long
before
captain
brocq
death
wilhelmine
with
a
look
of
sorrowful
disappointment
closed
her
lips
she
was
resolutely
mute
henri
de
loubersac
brightened
up
thanked
her
with
a
frankness
so
spontaneous
so
sincere
that
it
would
have
touched
the
hardest
woman
heart
and
wilhelmine
was
a
supremely
tender
and
sensitive
one
yet
when
he
again
asked
for
whom
she
was
going
to
pray
for
whom
was
the
delicious
bouquet
of
violets
she
was
carrying
half
hidden
in
her
muff
she
murmured
that
is
my
secret
if
i
told
you
the
name
of
the
person
at
whose
tomb
i
am
going
to
pray
it
would
have
no
significance
for
you
wilhelmine
let
me
accompany
you
implored
de
loubersac
i
love
you
so
much
you
must
forgive
my
blundering
the
lovers
discussed
the
question
finally
wilhelmine
hesitations
were
overcome
de
loubersac
carried
the
day
triumphantly
mademoiselle
berthe
had
fallen
behind
she
had
kept
a
discreet
distance
between
the
lovers
and
herself
but
had
watched
them
with
the
eyes
of
a
lynx
now
wilhelmine
waited
for
her
to
come
up
with
them
then
she
requested
her
companion
to
stay
in
the
quiet
avenue
rachel
while
she
and
lieutenant
de
loubersac
went
into
the
cemetery
no
sooner
had
they
disappeared
than
bobinette
set
off
as
fast
as
she
could
go
in
the
direction
of
the
boulevard
de
clichy
yes
there
was
the
sordid
figure
of
old
vagualame
bent
under
the
weight
of
years
and
of
his
ancient
accordion
he
seemed
to
be
stooping
more
than
usual
had
he
also
followed
them
he
had
thus
was
continuing
his
quest
with
the
hope
of
getting
further
light
on
the
series
of
mysteries
he
was
seeking
to
solve
he
must
learn
more
of
relations
with
fantômas
whom
she
apparently
knew
only
under
the
guise
of
vagualame
juve
had
made
himself
up
so
carefully
that
he
felt
confident
even
the
bandit
intimates
would
not
suspect
they
had
to
do
with
a
police
officer
its
quality
was
soon
proved
bobinette
came
towards
him
with
not
a
sign
of
uneasiness
there
you
are
then
she
cried
in
spite
of
her
familiar
address
juve
noticed
the
touch
of
respect
in
bobinette
voice
vagualame
played
the
part
of
master
to
this
girl
what
a
long
time
it
is
since
one
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
my
dear
monsieur
vagualame
there
was
a
touch
of
malicious
irony
in
bobinette
tone
nodded
he
would
have
liked
to
know
what
wilhelmine
and
henri
were
doing
in
the
cemetery
but
bobinette
was
his
query
for
the
moment
her
next
remark
was
startling
it
looks
as
though
you
were
afraid
to
show
yourself
since
your
last
crime
juve
repressed
any
sign
of
the
satisfaction
this
declaration
gave
him
my
last
crime
do
play
the
blockhead
she
went
on
have
you
forgotten
that
you
told
me
how
you
had
assassinated
captain
brocq
that
is
ancient
history
muttered
juve
and
i
am
not
afraid
of
anyone
besides
did
i
tell
you
that
now
he
hinted
with
the
hope
of
obtaining
further
details
but
bobinette
seemed
to
think
she
had
had
enough
of
the
subject
she
laughed
what
a
way
of
walking
you
have
she
exclaimed
juve
was
purposely
exaggerating
vagualame
attitude
it
enabled
him
to
conceal
his
face
better
i
stoop
so
much
because
my
age
weighs
me
down
when
you
grow
bobinette
burst
into
peals
of
laughter
you
do
think
do
you
vagualame
that
i
take
you
for
an
old
man
ha
ha
i
know
you
are
disguised
made
up
admirably
i
dare
say
but
you
are
a
young
man
i
am
quite
quite
sure
of
it
juve
was
saying
to
himself
this
grows
better
and
better
juve
conviction
was
that
this
old
vagualame
secret
agent
of
the
second
bureau
murderer
of
captain
brocq
the
vagualame
he
had
encountered
at
fandor
flat
could
only
be
a
young
man
in
the
flower
of
his
age
could
be
none
other
than
fantômas
juve
was
about
to
put
more
questions
to
bobinette
but
two
figures
came
into
view
and
they
were
nearing
the
avenue
rachel
make
off
with
you
cried
bobinette
there
they
are
coming
back
juve
did
not
wish
de
loubersac
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
him
he
would
be
surprised
suspicious
and
would
question
him
about
the
missed
rendezvous
juve
had
not
gained
sufficient
information
however
i
must
see
you
again
bobinette
his
tone
was
pressing
insistent
when
this
evening
impossible
then
bobinette
shook
her
head
you
know
very
well
that
i
shall
be
gone
where
where
the
beauty
cried
impatiently
it
you
ask
me
that
why
i
go
to
the
frontier
correct
said
juve
he
would
have
welcomed
further
details
well
then
when
can
we
meet
pressed
this
determined
accordion
player
how
about
next
wednesday
suggested
bobinette
that
will
do
we
will
go
to
the
theatre
a
moving
picture
show
always
to
places
in
the
dark
eh
observed
bobinette
maliciously
wilhelmine
and
henri
were
coming
nearer
turned
as
he
was
making
off
nine
before
the
moving
picture
place
rue
des
poissonniers
with
that
disappeared
into
a
smoky
wine
shop
de
loubersac
very
pale
and
wilhelmine
whose
eyes
were
red
rejoined
bobinette
whose
face
became
expressionless
they
went
slowly
off
together
when
the
coast
was
clear
left
the
wine
shop
and
proceeded
towards
the
cemetery
amid
the
cypresses
and
tombs
of
the
necropolis
looming
sad
and
shadowy
in
the
fading
light
he
made
his
way
slowly
along
the
principal
path
questing
for
traces
of
the
lovers
footsteps
in
the
sand
he
was
fortunate
enough
to
come
on
them
at
once
the
soil
being
moist
the
lovers
footmarks
could
be
clearly
distinguished
in
the
sand
of
the
alleys
guided
by
them
juve
turned
into
a
little
pathway
on
the
right
passing
the
mausoleums
and
pausing
before
a
grave
that
of
captain
brocq
a
humble
tomb
a
few
fresh
violets
were
scattered
around
it
from
wilhelmine
bunch
no
doubt
the
lovers
had
but
tarried
there
juve
continued
to
follow
their
footmarks
by
many
twists
and
turns
almost
to
the
end
of
the
cemetery
as
he
advanced
he
felt
more
and
more
certain
that
he
had
come
this
way
some
years
ago
when
his
detective
work
had
led
him
into
a
mysterious
network
of
robberies
and
murders
the
moving
spirit
of
them
all
being
fantômas
the
enigmatic
fantômas
juve
was
going
over
in
memory
those
past
days
of
mysterious
doings
and
strange
adventures
when
he
found
himself
facing
a
vault
richly
decorated
with
unusually
beautiful
sculpture
a
bronze
plaque
was
affixed
to
this
tomb
and
on
it
engraved
in
letters
of
gold
was
a
name
juve
had
had
occasion
to
utter
many
a
time
and
oft
lady
beltham
lady
beltham
a
name
juve
associated
with
strange
and
terrible
events
lady
beltham
had
been
a
sensational
creature
footnote
see
exploits
of
juve
vol
ii
of
the
fantômas
series
after
adventures
one
more
extraordinary
than
another
juve
had
succeeded
in
identifying
this
english
great
lady
as
the
mistress
of
a
formidable
criminal
relentlessly
hunted
down
for
ever
escaping
the
elusive
fantômas
juve
had
lost
track
of
both
when
the
discovery
of
an
extraordinary
crime
had
led
to
the
identification
of
the
victim
a
woman
she
was
declared
to
be
lady
beltham
the
corpse
had
been
buried
in
this
very
cemetery
distant
relatives
in
england
had
guaranteed
all
expenses
connected
with
the
burial
and
erection
of
this
costly
tomb
the
public
had
believed
this
to
be
the
end
of
lady
beltham
juve
presently
discovered
that
lady
beltham
was
not
dead
another
woman
had
been
buried
in
her
place
he
preserved
absolute
silence
convinced
that
sooner
or
later
this
criminal
great
lady
for
in
conjunction
with
fantômas
she
had
committed
abominable
crimes
would
reappear
and
he
could
then
arrest
her
time
had
passed
but
for
all
his
efforts
juve
could
not
discover
the
of
this
strangely
guilty
woman
when
he
saw
a
large
bunch
of
violets
lying
before
the
door
of
lady
beltham
vault
he
divined
them
to
be
the
offering
of
wilhelmine
juve
now
asked
himself
if
he
had
not
come
across
this
wilhelmine
in
the
past
this
girl
with
pale
gold
hair
and
clear
deep
eyes
if
he
had
not
in
the
long
ago
met
under
painful
circumstances
a
little
child
who
was
now
this
pretty
girl
beloved
of
henri
de
loubersac
juve
did
not
dwell
on
these
vague
floating
impressions
he
turned
his
attention
to
more
definite
points
there
were
people
who
believed
in
the
death
of
lady
beltham
they
were
in
the
majority
among
these
was
wilhelmine
de
naarboveck
why
did
she
come
to
pray
at
lady
beltham
tomb
and
bring
offerings
of
fragrant
flowers
a
mere
handful
of
people
knew
lady
beltham
was
not
dead
knew
that
another
woman
had
been
interred
in
her
stead
lady
beltham
herself
knew
it
her
accomplice
and
lover
fantômas
must
know
it
besides
these
two
there
was
jérôme
fandor
who
knew
of
the
substitution
and
there
was
juve
himself
what
others
could
there
be
twilight
was
deepening
into
darkness
the
cemetery
guardians
were
clearing
it
of
visitors
juve
became
once
more
the
old
accordion
player
as
he
made
his
way
home
on
foot
he
asked
himself
what
are
they
looking
for
the
military
authorities
represented
by
the
second
bureau
want
to
recover
a
stolen
document
the
civil
authority
represented
by
police
headquarters
wish
to
discover
a
murderer
guilty
of
two
crimes
the
murder
of
brocq
the
murder
of
nichoune
the
murderer
of
brocq
is
assuredly
vagualame
as
to
the
murderer
of
nichoune
i
do
not
yet
know
under
what
guise
he
committed
his
crime
but
of
one
thing
i
am
certain
the
author
of
this
double
crime
is
none
other
than
fantômas
xv
the
traitor
apprenticeship
although
for
the
past
four
days
fandor
had
shown
himself
the
most
punctual
the
most
correct
the
most
brilliant
of
french
corporals
although
he
had
replaced
the
unfortunate
vinson
with
striking
ability
it
was
never
without
a
feeling
of
bewildered
terror
that
he
awoke
each
morning
in
the
vast
at
verdun
no
sooner
was
he
dressed
than
he
found
himself
in
the
thick
of
a
life
made
up
of
fears
of
alarms
a
nightmare
life
the
strain
of
which
was
concealed
by
an
alert
confident
manner
a
gallant
bearing
never
having
done
his
military
service
since
legally
he
did
not
exist
it
was
the
cruelest
mystery
in
our
life
fandor
had
played
his
corporal
rôle
by
intuition
combined
with
a
trained
power
of
observation
vinson
manual
and
verbal
instructions
vinson
for
his
own
sake
most
of
all
had
utilised
every
minute
and
had
put
the
eager
fandor
through
several
turns
of
the
military
mill
nevertheless
whenever
he
gave
an
order
to
the
men
of
his
squad
he
asked
himself
with
terror
whether
he
had
not
inadvertently
committed
some
gross
blunder
whether
some
inferior
might
not
call
out
ironically
i
say
corporal
vinson
where
the
devil
have
you
come
from
to
be
carrying
on
like
that
suppose
i
were
found
out
he
thought
i
wonder
if
they
would
shoot
me
forthwith
to
teach
me
not
to
run
such
mad
risks
in
search
of
information
for
police
reports
on
this
particular
morning
fandor
awoke
with
a
stronger
feeling
of
uneasiness
than
ever
the
previous
evening
the
adjutant
for
the
week
had
drawn
him
apart
at
and
had
handed
him
a
slip
of
paper
you
have
a
day
leave
you
have
joined
only
four
days
yet
you
have
managed
to
obtain
your
evening
smart
work
congratulations
by
jove
you
must
have
some
powerful
backing
fandor
had
smiled
saluted
marched
off
to
bed
but
not
to
sleep
a
day
leave
the
devil
in
it
who
signed
for
me
what
is
the
next
move
to
be
he
thought
this
very
morning
at
ten
delivery
the
post
sergeant
had
handed
him
a
card
it
bore
the
paris
postmark
on
it
was
drawn
the
route
from
verdun
to
the
frontier
that
was
all
he
remembered
what
vinson
had
said
to
him
in
the
flat
what
is
so
terrifying
about
this
spying
business
is
that
one
never
knows
whom
one
is
obeying
whose
orders
one
ought
to
follow
who
is
your
friend
who
is
your
chief
one
fine
day
you
learn
that
you
have
had
leave
granted
you
you
then
receive
in
some
way
or
another
directions
to
go
to
some
place
or
another
you
go
there
you
meet
people
you
do
not
know
who
ask
you
questions
sometimes
seemingly
trivial
sometimes
obviously
of
the
gravest
importance
it
is
up
to
you
to
find
out
whether
you
are
face
to
face
with
your
spy
chiefs
or
if
on
the
contrary
you
have
not
fallen
into
a
trap
set
by
the
police
to
catch
spies
you
can
not
go
to
a
rendezvous
with
a
quiet
mind
how
do
you
know
that
you
will
not
be
returned
between
two
gendarmes
it
is
impossible
to
ask
for
information
equally
impossible
to
ask
for
help
should
you
be
in
imminent
danger
spies
do
not
know
one
another
they
are
disowned
by
whoever
employs
them
they
are
humble
wheels
hidden
in
an
immense
mechanism
it
matters
little
if
they
are
broken
to
pieces
they
can
so
easily
be
replaced
fandor
recollection
of
these
statements
did
not
tend
to
make
him
cheerful
he
summed
up
the
situation
and
came
to
a
decision
i
have
been
given
leave
i
did
not
ask
for
somebody
must
have
asked
it
for
me
this
is
the
chief
spy
already
in
touch
with
vinson
or
the
chief
spy
at
verdun
who
has
been
warned
of
arrival
the
post
card
i
received
from
an
unknown
individual
has
nothing
on
it
but
the
indications
of
a
route
already
known
to
me
that
from
verdun
to
the
frontier
i
shall
follow
that
route
as
a
pedestrian
and
i
look
forward
to
meeting
some
interesting
persons
on
the
way
surrounded
by
the
noisy
disorder
of
the
barrack
room
amidst
men
rising
hastily
that
they
might
not
be
reported
missing
at
the
morning
muster
which
would
shortly
take
place
in
the
courtyard
dressed
quickly
he
put
on
his
ascertained
that
his
servant
had
sufficiently
polished
the
brass
buttons
on
his
tunic
his
sabre
and
other
trappings
the
adjutant
for
the
week
entered
you
are
off
at
once
vinson
yes
sir
good
i
will
arrange
for
the
fatigues
very
pleased
to
ah
you
are
new
here
are
you
not
well
i
will
give
you
a
bit
of
good
advice
be
in
the
barracks
on
the
stroke
of
the
hour
remember
men
on
leave
must
not
play
tricks
with
punctuality
right
sir
the
adjutant
turned
sharp
about
and
went
off
he
is
jolly
amiable
that
sure
was
fandor
comment
i
wonder
if
by
since
fandor
had
so
rashly
mixed
himself
up
in
this
spy
business
he
was
inclined
to
see
everywhere
traitors
and
accomplices
but
he
reminded
himself
that
he
must
beware
of
preconceived
ideas
it
was
on
the
stroke
of
seven
when
fandor
showed
his
permit
to
the
sergeant
at
the
gate
of
the
barracks
here
one
who
going
to
amuse
himself
grumbled
the
sergeant
pass
corporal
fandor
smiled
joyously
but
the
smile
did
not
express
his
real
feelings
instead
of
making
directly
for
the
road
to
the
frontier
he
strolled
about
the
town
went
by
roundabout
ways
returned
on
his
steps
assuring
himself
that
he
was
not
being
shadowed
the
day
was
fine
a
slight
violet
haze
lingered
in
the
hollows
the
air
fresh
but
not
chill
was
deliciously
pure
fandor
walked
along
the
high
road
at
a
smart
pace
he
turned
over
in
his
mind
certain
warnings
given
him
by
vinson
when
an
individual
knows
he
is
going
to
a
rendezvous
he
makes
a
point
of
talking
to
every
person
he
meets
whom
he
thinks
likely
to
be
the
individual
he
is
to
have
dealings
with
but
fandor
did
not
see
a
soul
to
speak
to
the
highway
was
deserted
and
the
fields
lay
empty
and
desolate
as
far
as
an
eye
could
reach
not
a
toiling
peasant
was
to
be
seen
he
had
been
walking
for
over
an
hour
quite
determined
to
carry
this
adventure
through
to
the
end
when
from
the
top
of
a
hill
he
caught
sight
of
a
drawn
up
on
one
of
the
lower
slopes
of
the
road
they
may
or
may
not
be
the
individuals
i
am
out
to
meet
he
thought
but
i
am
glad
enough
to
meet
some
human
beings
i
shall
stroll
near
their
car
which
seems
out
of
action
it
will
help
pass
the
time
he
went
up
to
the
there
were
two
people
in
it
a
man
clad
in
an
immensely
valuable
fur
coat
and
a
young
priest
so
muffled
up
in
rugs
and
wraps
and
cloaks
that
only
his
two
eyes
could
be
seen
just
as
he
got
up
to
them
he
heard
the
priest
say
in
a
tart
voice
to
the
man
in
the
fur
coat
now
standing
in
the
road
whatever
is
the
matter
what
has
gone
wrong
with
your
car
now
the
priest
smart
companion
exclaimed
in
a
tone
of
comic
despair
it
is
not
the
right
front
tire
this
time
it
is
the
back
tire
the
left
one
that
is
punctured
ought
i
to
get
out
by
no
means
do
not
stir
i
am
going
to
put
the
under
the
car
and
shall
replace
the
damaged
tire
in
no
time
fandor
was
only
a
few
yards
off
the
man
in
the
fur
coat
evidently
his
own
chauffeur
half
turned
towards
the
soldier
adding
unfortunately
my
jack
does
not
work
very
well
i
doubt
if
i
can
succeed
unaided
in
getting
it
under
the
can
i
give
you
a
lift
asked
fandor
the
chauffeur
turned
with
a
smile
that
is
very
kind
of
you
corporal
i
will
not
refuse
your
help
from
a
box
he
extracted
a
which
to
fandor
expert
eye
did
not
seem
to
function
so
badly
as
all
that
the
chauffeur
slipped
it
under
the
car
fandor
lent
an
experienced
hand
and
lifted
the
wheel
whose
tire
had
just
given
up
the
ghost
there
monsieur
these
punctures
are
the
cause
of
endless
delays
remarked
fandor
for
the
sake
of
saying
something
the
priest
shrugged
and
said
in
a
disagreeable
tone
our
tires
have
come
to
grief
twice
already
this
morning
the
chauffeur
was
busied
with
his
car
fiddling
with
the
machinery
he
shot
a
question
at
fandor
are
we
far
from
verdun
five
or
six
kilometres
no
more
about
that
monsieur
the
chauffeur
stood
upright
it
is
verdun
then
we
can
see
over
there
what
do
you
mean
queried
fandor
that
belfry
in
the
mist
that
is
not
a
belfry
it
is
a
chimney
the
bakehouse
chimney
of
the
new
bakehouse
then
yes
monsieur
i
had
an
idea
it
was
not
it
is
not
finished
but
it
soon
will
be
in
a
matter
of
six
ah
good
now
tell
me
is
there
no
railway
along
the
route
we
are
following
no
they
intend
laying
down
a
line
for
strategic
purposes
but
they
have
not
started
on
it
yet
the
chauffeur
smiled
approval
while
continuing
to
tinker
at
his
machine
ah
these
projects
he
remarked
they
are
long
in
coming
to
anything
these
french
administrative
projects
well
yes
there
was
a
pregnant
silence
fandor
thought
this
grows
interesting
it
is
quite
on
the
cards
that
this
tourist
may
ouf
exclaimed
the
chauffeur
suddenly
jumping
up
a
stiff
job
this
corporal
will
you
be
good
enough
to
lend
me
a
hand
again
certainly
oh
not
just
at
once
let
me
rest
a
few
moments
doubled
up
as
i
have
been
my
back
feels
positively
broken
the
stranger
took
a
few
steps
along
the
road
he
pointed
to
the
horizon
one
has
a
pretty
view
here
you
know
this
part
of
the
country
corporal
so
so
fairly
well
ah
then
you
can
give
me
some
information
what
is
that
other
big
chimney
down
there
do
you
see
it
between
those
trees
those
two
trees
there
it
is
the
chimney
of
the
bell
foundry
ah
yes
i
have
heard
that
foundry
mentioned
it
is
true
it
seems
to
be
quite
near
fandor
shook
his
head
it
seems
to
be
but
by
the
road
it
is
a
good
eleven
kilometres
away
as
much
as
that
as
the
crow
flies
it
is
close
to
yes
it
seems
so
the
chauffeur
insisted
but
how
far
do
you
think
it
is
corporal
from
here
to
it
in
a
straight
line
they
ought
to
teach
you
to
measure
distances
in
your
regiment
fandor
was
no
longer
in
doubt
this
man
was
the
spy
he
was
out
to
meet
fandor
once
again
recalled
vinson
words
when
one
has
to
do
with
a
fresh
spy
chief
it
is
a
certain
thing
that
he
will
make
you
pass
a
little
kind
of
examination
will
put
you
through
a
regular
to
ascertain
your
capacities
what
you
are
made
of
corporal
replied
instantly
as
the
crow
flies
i
calculate
it
is
not
more
than
four
kilometres
the
road
winds
a
great
deal
good
good
cried
the
chauffeur
i
should
have
said
so
also
it
seemed
to
fandor
that
the
man
in
the
costly
fur
coat
hesitated
was
on
the
point
of
asking
a
question
thought
better
of
it
turned
away
went
back
to
his
car
he
called
out
look
here
corporal
since
you
are
so
kind
help
me
with
this
lever
that
was
soon
done
the
inquisition
recommenced
have
you
been
long
with
the
verdun
garrison
oh
no
only
a
few
days
you
are
not
bored
why
should
i
be
i
mean
you
do
not
find
the
discipline
severe
fandor
tried
to
find
out
what
the
man
in
the
fur
coat
was
driving
at
oh
i
have
not
much
to
complain
of
i
can
get
leave
pretty
easily
and
that
is
always
pleasant
remarked
the
man
in
the
fur
coat
young
soldiers
in
garrison
towns
have
a
deuced
poor
time
of
it
is
that
not
so
and
they
do
not
know
how
to
amuse
themselves
when
they
have
leave
but
no
doubt
you
have
friends
here
corporal
i
do
not
know
a
soul
in
verdun
ah
well
since
you
have
been
so
obliging
it
would
give
me
pleasure
to
introduce
you
to
some
people
if
you
would
care
for
it
you
would
find
them
amusing
you
have
friends
in
verdun
sir
asked
fandor
in
his
turn
i
know
a
few
people
so
does
the
abbé
who
accompanies
me
i
have
it
an
idea
corporal
come
at
six
this
evening
no
seven
and
very
punctually
and
ask
for
me
at
the
printing
office
of
the
noret
brothers
they
are
real
good
fellows
you
will
find
some
youngsters
of
your
own
age
there
you
will
find
you
have
much
in
common
i
am
sure
they
will
prove
useful
acquaintances
the
man
in
the
fur
coat
accented
the
word
useful
this
told
fandor
that
there
was
business
on
hand
at
the
printing
works
and
he
was
to
be
involved
in
it
you
are
really
too
kind
sir
i
do
not
wish
not
at
all
not
at
all
it
is
nothing
and
you
have
been
so
obliging
come
to
the
noret
at
seven
without
fear
of
being
considered
an
intruder
the
man
in
the
fur
coat
accentuated
the
word
fear
significantly
he
set
his
motor
going
and
jumped
into
the
car
again
many
thanks
corporal
i
do
not
offer
to
take
you
back
to
verdun
as
my
car
has
only
two
seats
till
this
evening
then
the
car
moved
off
rapidly
putting
on
speed
there
goes
the
chief
spy
thought
fandor
never
set
eyes
on
the
fellow
before
nor
heard
his
voice
either
now
whom
shall
i
meet
at
this
cursed
rendezvous
and
what
is
the
business
some
traitorous
deviltry
of
course
it
was
striking
seven
when
fandor
presented
himself
at
the
noret
printing
works
he
rang
he
was
admitted
and
shown
into
a
there
was
a
touch
of
the
convent
parlour
about
it
the
man
who
had
opened
to
him
asked
what
name
shall
i
give
to
the
gentlemen
monsieur
tell
them
it
is
corporal
vinson
fandor
heart
was
beating
like
a
sledge
hammer
as
the
minutes
dragged
by
it
was
an
eternity
of
waiting
a
flock
of
suspicions
crowded
his
mind
might
he
not
have
fallen
into
a
trap
at
last
a
tall
thin
young
man
walked
into
the
room
he
greeted
with
good
evening
corporal
our
mutual
friends
have
informed
us
that
we
might
expect
you
they
have
not
arrived
yet
but
there
is
no
need
to
wait
for
a
regular
introduction
what
do
you
think
you
are
too
kind
monsieur
a
simple
corporal
like
myself
is
very
fortunate
to
find
friends
in
a
garrison
town
to
pass
the
time
till
our
friends
arrive
what
do
you
say
to
visiting
the
workshops
you
will
find
it
interesting
and
useful
that
word
again
thought
fandor
decidedly
there
is
business
afoot
his
guide
expanded
in
paris
they
despise
provincial
industries
they
pretend
to
believe
that
no
good
work
is
done
can
be
done
in
country
districts
it
is
a
mistaken
notion
examine
our
machines
the
young
man
ushered
fandor
into
the
workshops
they
were
extensive
spacious
here
is
the
machine
which
prints
off
beacon
of
he
explained
you
can
see
for
yourself
that
it
is
the
latest
model
do
you
know
anything
about
the
working
of
these
machines
fandor
could
hardly
restrain
his
laughter
what
would
this
guide
of
mine
think
if
he
knew
that
for
a
good
many
years
i
have
had
to
cross
the
of
every
evening
and
consequently
have
been
able
to
see
and
admire
printing
machines
of
a
very
different
quality
of
perfection
to
this
one
he
has
praised
so
emphatically
played
up
it
seems
to
me
a
marvellous
machine
i
should
like
to
see
it
working
the
young
man
smiled
come
here
some
afternoon
and
i
will
show
you
the
machine
in
full
work
come
soon
he
led
fandor
to
another
part
of
the
do
you
know
anything
about
linotypes
again
played
the
admirer
part
though
he
knew
these
machines
were
what
is
his
game
was
our
journalist
mental
query
the
answer
soon
came
his
guide
led
him
to
a
object
concealed
by
some
grey
material
it
might
well
be
a
cabinet
for
storing
odds
and
ends
but
fandor
felt
sure
the
grey
stuff
covered
something
metallic
see
corporal
this
will
please
you
said
the
young
man
he
uncovered
the
object
you
know
what
it
is
do
you
corporal
not
in
the
least
a
machine
for
making
really
you
manufacture
do
you
remarked
fandor
his
tone
was
you
shall
see
for
yourself
corporal
of
course
they
are
only
made
for
the
fun
of
the
thing
still
they
might
happen
to
prove
useful
one
never
knows
again
the
marked
accent
on
useful
again
played
up
i
should
like
to
have
a
squint
at
those
notes
i
was
going
to
suggest
it
turning
a
handle
the
young
man
put
the
machine
in
motion
place
yourself
there
corporal
put
your
hands
to
it
you
shall
see
what
will
happen
fandor
did
as
directed
hold
out
your
hands
held
out
his
hands
a
new
note
fell
into
them
what
do
you
say
to
that
is
it
not
a
good
a
perfect
imitation
the
young
man
tone
was
triumphant
examined
it
that
it
certainly
is
he
acquiesced
here
are
more
look
take
them
nine
notes
fell
into
the
outstretched
hands
of
corporal
of
the
of
the
line
stationed
at
verdun
our
journalist
had
sharp
eyes
he
was
no
longer
puzzling
over
this
performance
look
here
corporal
keep
these
notes
if
they
amuse
you
said
the
young
man
smiling
you
might
even
try
to
pass
them
off
if
the
joke
appeals
to
you
fandor
replies
were
monosyllables
he
was
watching
the
machine
what
a
childish
trick
he
said
to
himself
why
these
notes
dropped
into
my
hands
are
real
this
machine
does
not
print
anything
my
new
friend
has
slipped
these
notes
under
the
rollers
as
payment
for
future
treachery
expected
betrayals
it
is
a
way
of
paying
me
corporal
found
the
necessary
words
to
show
he
fully
understood
the
quality
of
the
payment
its
real
value
supposing
that
no
more
would
be
required
of
him
he
tried
to
get
free
of
this
spy
and
leave
the
premises
but
his
paymaster
had
other
views
now
corporal
said
he
shall
we
empty
a
bottle
together
in
honour
of
our
meeting
fandor
was
far
from
wishing
to
clink
glasses
with
the
spy
still
needs
must
when
the
devil
drives
you
into
a
tight
corner
of
your
own
choosing
the
offer
was
accepted
with
feigned
pleasure
corporal
kept
a
smiling
face
whilst
glass
in
hand
he
talked
trivialities
with
his
host
at
last
corporal
rose
my
leave
has
not
expired
it
is
true
monsieur
he
said
but
i
have
some
rounds
to
make
pray
excuse
me
the
thin
young
man
did
not
seek
to
detain
him
the
interview
was
at
an
end
the
business
done
for
that
evening
you
will
return
will
you
not
corporal
asked
his
host
we
are
at
your
disposal
i
and
my
brother
whenever
you
have
need
of
us
our
friends
also
they
will
regret
having
arrived
too
late
to
meet
you
and
corporal
we
know
some
officers
if
you
want
leave
now
and
again
you
must
let
us
know
will
you
not
corporal
said
the
expected
things
and
hastened
away
glad
to
be
quit
of
this
young
spy
of
a
printer
he
hurried
off
towards
the
centre
of
the
town
covering
his
tracks
as
juve
had
taught
him
how
to
do
he
had
time
to
spare
before
returning
to
barracks
he
entered
a
small
café
and
ordered
a
drink
behold
me
one
of
the
precious
spy
circle
of
verdun
thought
he
i
must
make
the
most
of
my
privileges
his
glass
remained
untouched
while
he
sat
thinking
long
and
deeply
xvi
at
the
elysée
ball
the
ball
was
in
full
swing
there
was
a
crush
in
the
brilliantly
lighted
of
the
elysée
prominent
members
of
parliament
diplomats
officers
naval
and
military
representatives
of
the
higher
circles
of
commerce
and
finance
rubbed
shoulders
with
the
undistinguished
at
the
official
reception
given
in
honour
of
new
ambassador
prince
ito
the
prince
was
stationed
in
the
centre
of
the
inmost
gorgeously
arrayed
in
his
national
costume
a
delicate
smile
on
his
lips
as
he
watched
the
president
guests
with
bright
shrewd
eyes
while
music
from
an
invisible
hungarian
band
floated
on
the
air
in
this
particular
room
two
men
were
in
earnest
conversation
colonel
hofferman
and
lieutenant
de
loubersac
well
lieutenant
i
have
been
too
pressed
for
time
to
see
you
but
heaven
knows
i
have
not
forgotten
for
a
moment
the
matter
i
entrusted
to
you
they
are
causing
me
the
greatest
i
can
well
understand
that
anything
new
no
colonel
that
is
to
say
i
ought
to
say
to
what
the
devil
do
you
mean
the
colonel
stared
at
his
junior
a
moment
then
taking
him
by
the
arm
said
in
a
confidential
tone
let
us
take
a
turn
in
the
garden
it
is
not
cold
we
had
better
have
our
talk
away
from
such
a
collection
as
this
one
does
not
know
who
or
what
one
neighbours
may
be
right
colonel
prudence
is
the
mother
of
surety
the
colonel
shrugged
i
have
no
desire
to
pun
but
since
you
speak
of
la
sûreté
i
can
not
help
noticing
that
they
are
blundering
terribly
over
these
very
affairs
confound
those
clumsy
fools
and
their
meddling
they
will
interfere
with
things
which
are
no
concern
of
theirs
not
in
the
slightest
footnote
la
yard
detective
service
are
they
still
investigating
no
the
warning
i
myself
administered
to
their
famous
juve
has
taught
them
a
lesson
they
are
keeping
quiet
at
present
plague
take
the
lot
of
them
it
makes
me
furious
when
i
think
what
happened
the
other
day
creating
a
scandal
about
things
the
public
ought
to
be
kept
in
ignorance
of
ought
never
to
hear
of
never
those
confounded
meddlers
complicate
our
task
abominably
colonel
hofferman
paused
de
loubersac
kept
a
discreet
silence
the
two
men
were
walking
down
the
little
path
which
encircles
the
principal
lawn
of
the
elysée
gardens
now
almost
deserted
the
colonel
turned
to
his
companion
what
was
that
you
were
saying
just
now
you
had
something
fresh
to
tell
me
and
you
had
not
that
is
the
norman
way
of
putting
it
not
like
you
de
loubersac
it
is
merely
the
answer
of
one
who
hesitates
to
speak
out
replied
de
loubersac
laughing
who
hesitates
to
give
a
definite
opinion
who
who
nevertheless
what
de
loubersac
just
forget
i
am
your
colonel
speak
out
man
have
you
an
idea
of
where
the
document
was
lost
that
then
what
conclusion
have
you
arrived
at
have
you
further
information
about
brocq
death
hum
about
nichoune
death
perhaps
colonel
have
you
noticed
that
for
some
time
past
i
have
not
handed
you
any
report
from
the
agent
vagualame
the
deuce
what
do
you
imagine
that
means
i
do
not
imagine
anything
colonel
i
state
facts
nichoune
is
dead
murdered
there
is
not
a
shadow
of
a
doubt
about
that
nichoune
was
the
mistress
of
corporal
vinson
this
vinson
was
on
the
point
of
playing
the
traitor
if
he
had
not
already
done
so
he
was
also
a
friend
of
captain
brocq
and
brocq
died
just
when
the
document
disappeared
the
document
confided
to
him
by
our
service
so
much
for
facts
the
colonel
was
staring
fixedly
at
de
loubersac
i
do
not
see
what
you
are
driving
at
said
he
i
am
coming
to
it
colonel
nichoune
was
found
dead
on
saturday
november
but
on
the
evening
of
november
nichoune
received
a
visit
from
our
agent
vagualame
whom
i
had
sent
to
châlons
by
your
own
orders
to
occupy
himself
with
the
v
affair
well
well
colonel
i
do
not
much
like
that
but
what
i
like
still
less
is
that
a
few
days
ago
i
had
occasion
to
see
vagualame
and
this
agent
far
from
bringing
me
details
of
nichoune
death
at
first
go
off
wanted
to
deny
that
he
had
been
at
châlons
i
could
swear
he
was
going
to
declare
he
had
not
been
there
when
a
reply
of
my
own
a
blunder
i
confess
it
i
did
not
take
time
to
think
informed
him
that
i
knew
of
his
visit
to
nichoune
colonel
hofferman
weighed
the
gravity
of
de
loubersac
words
he
strode
along
head
bent
hands
clasped
behind
his
back
gazing
with
unseeing
eyes
at
the
pebbles
on
the
path
at
last
he
spoke
tell
me
how
you
knew
for
certain
that
nichoune
had
received
a
visit
from
vagualame
for
some
time
past
colonel
vagualame
has
been
under
the
eye
of
the
officer
charged
with
the
supervision
of
our
spies
de
loreuil
under
the
guise
of
aunt
palmyra
he
discovered
that
nichoune
had
been
murdered
this
was
the
morning
after
her
interview
with
vagualame
the
discovery
i
may
tell
you
did
not
take
de
loreuil
altogether
by
surprise
he
had
observed
vagualame
attitude
towards
the
girl
and
had
considered
it
queer
suspiciously
so
this
is
serious
but
it
is
not
sufficiently
definite
pronounced
colonel
hofferman
let
us
admit
that
vagualame
has
played
a
double
game
has
been
at
once
traitor
and
spy
that
being
so
he
may
have
murdered
nichoune
but
as
to
incriminating
this
agent
whom
we
have
known
a
long
time
well
you
have
merely
a
vague
indication
to
go
upon
the
kind
of
reticence
or
what
you
thought
was
reticence
he
wished
to
maintain
regarding
his
journey
to
châlons
yes
admitted
de
loubersac
if
that
were
all
i
had
to
go
upon
it
would
amount
to
little
you
know
something
else
i
know
that
i
arranged
to
meet
this
agent
yesterday
in
the
garden
as
our
custom
is
that
i
waited
there
that
he
never
turned
up
colonel
hofferman
took
de
loubersac
arm
as
they
walked
slowly
back
to
the
what
you
have
just
told
me
is
exceedingly
serious
we
must
enquire
into
this
at
once
without
loss
of
time
if
vagualame
has
really
fled
the
probability
is
that
he
is
nichoune
murderer
in
that
case
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
our
suspecting
him
of
no
end
of
things
which
i
need
not
the
colonel
pointed
to
an
individual
standing
by
a
buffet
near
the
entrance
to
the
great
let
us
go
the
other
way
said
he
there
is
monsieur
havard
i
do
not
at
all
want
to
meet
him
if
we
have
to
arrest
vagualame
it
would
be
unnecessary
to
take
police
headquarters
into
our
confidence
undoubtedly
colonel
then
let
us
keep
clear
of
monsieur
havard
devote
your
whole
attention
to
clearing
up
the
questions
raised
by
your
talk
find
vagualame
for
me
in
three
days
if
you
have
not
run
him
to
earth
then
set
our
special
enquiry
men
on
his
track
i
shall
see
you
at
the
ministry
six
sharp
whilst
colonel
hofferman
and
lieutenant
de
loubersac
were
having
their
talk
jérôme
fandor
who
was
also
at
the
elysée
ball
in
his
own
proper
person
was
busying
himself
with
the
affairs
which
had
led
him
to
consider
that
the
murder
of
captain
brocq
was
a
crime
which
must
be
imputed
to
one
of
those
foreign
spies
with
which
france
was
now
swarming
at
verdun
along
the
entire
frontier
there
were
nests
of
these
noxious
vermin
fandor
was
of
course
still
stationed
at
verdun
he
had
arrived
early
at
the
ball
hoping
to
pick
up
information
from
some
friend
as
to
how
the
second
bureau
was
taking
the
disappearance
of
corporal
vinson
did
the
second
bureau
suspect
anything
what
had
nichoune
murder
been
explained
fandor
stationed
himself
near
the
entrance
to
the
first
watching
all
who
entered
seeking
the
welcome
face
of
friend
or
acquaintance
someone
slapped
him
on
the
shoulder
hullo
fandor
are
you
reporting
the
official
fêtes
nowadays
you
bonnet
what
a
jolly
surprise
i
have
heard
nothing
of
you
for
ages
how
goes
it
my
dear
fellow
good
luck
has
come
my
way
at
last
i
am
police
magistrate
at
châlons
there
news
for
you
by
jove
bonnet
that
is
good
hearing
you
arrive
here
in
the
very
nick
of
time
old
bonnet
at
châlons
and
police
magistrate
thought
fandor
what
a
bit
of
luck
for
me
i
want
to
ask
the
police
magistrate
of
châlons
most
interesting
things
said
fandor
smiling
at
his
friend
information
for
a
report
queried
bonnet
just
so
fandor
drew
his
old
bonnet
away
from
the
crowd
of
eyes
and
ears
around
them
they
came
on
an
empty
little
the
very
place
now
tell
me
my
dear
bonnet
have
you
not
been
engaged
on
a
recent
case
the
death
of
a
little
singer
nichoune
that
is
so
my
first
case
at
châlons
ah
now
just
tell
me
the
examining
magistrate
shook
his
head
i
can
not
tell
you
much
for
the
good
reason
that
this
affair
is
as
mysterious
as
can
be
and
is
giving
me
no
end
of
trouble
you
knew
nichoune
fandor
yes
and
no
i
would
give
a
good
deal
though
to
know
who
her
murderer
is
i
also
said
bonnet
smiling
would
i
not
like
to
put
my
hand
on
the
collar
of
that
individual
naturally
i
want
to
carry
through
the
enquiry
with
flying
colours
have
you
no
idea
as
to
who
the
murderer
might
be
police
magistrate
bonnet
rose
that
is
as
may
be
it
seems
that
on
the
eve
of
her
death
this
nichoune
received
a
visit
from
an
old
man
a
beggar
whom
i
am
unable
to
identify
who
has
vanished
into
thin
air
would
you
like
me
to
keep
you
informed
rue
richer
is
still
your
address
yes
it
would
be
awfully
kind
of
you
to
write
when
you
have
any
fresh
facts
to
disclose
about
this
case
i
can
not
explain
to
you
all
the
importance
i
attach
to
that
but
it
is
enormous
it
is
understood
then
count
on
me
i
shall
tell
you
all
i
can
without
breaking
professional
secrecy
shall
we
take
a
turn
through
the
rooms
old
boy
if
you
like
my
dear
bonnet
the
two
men
strolled
through
the
thinning
rooms
talking
of
what
all
the
world
might
hear
dear
boy
i
must
leave
you
said
fandor
suddenly
an
interview
till
our
next
meeting
fandor
went
up
to
a
man
standing
in
a
doorway
gazing
disdainfully
at
the
couples
revolving
in
the
centre
of
the
room
will
you
grant
me
a
word
or
two
monsieur
havard
asked
fandor
respectfully
the
chief
of
police
brightened
four
if
you
like
my
good
fandor
i
am
bored
to
death
i
would
rather
submit
to
your
indiscreet
questioning
than
stick
here
in
a
brown
study
black
i
might
say
with
only
my
own
thoughts
for
company
good
heavens
chief
what
is
troubling
you
to
such
an
extent
monsieur
havard
laughed
oh
i
will
tell
you
the
reason
of
this
melancholy
mood
you
are
on
pretty
intimate
terms
with
juve
are
you
not
you
have
heard
from
him
chief
no
it
is
you
are
anxious
then
no
no
be
easy
smiled
monsieur
havard
he
caught
fandor
by
the
lapel
of
his
coat
look
here
my
dear
fellow
it
is
precisely
because
you
and
juve
are
on
such
intimate
terms
this
friendship
between
you
is
a
fine
thing
that
i
should
like
you
to
use
your
influence
with
juve
with
juve
yes
with
juve
you
know
how
highly
i
esteem
him
he
is
our
best
detective
very
well
he
is
making
a
thorough
mess
of
his
career
he
prevents
his
own
promotion
because
he
is
so
obstinately
set
on
searching
for
his
elusive
fugitive
fantômas
i
do
not
understand
you
chief
you
soon
will
do
you
know
where
juve
is
at
this
moment
no
i
am
as
ignorant
of
his
whereabouts
as
you
are
it
is
beyond
bearing
juve
goes
his
own
way
beyond
what
is
allowable
he
declared
to
me
the
other
day
that
he
was
certain
the
death
of
captain
brocq
must
be
credited
to
whose
account
do
you
think
why
to
fantômas
and
clac
since
then
i
have
not
heard
a
word
from
him
juve
is
pursuing
fantômas
now
fandor
how
can
i
tolerate
this
fandor
considered
juve
had
a
perfect
right
to
take
his
own
initiative
in
this
particular
matter
he
had
earned
the
right
if
ever
a
man
had
he
answered
his
aggrieved
chief
with
a
question
but
suppose
juve
is
right
right
but
he
deceives
himself
i
have
proof
of
it
you
have
proof
of
it
but
who
then
according
to
you
chief
has
killed
brocq
my
dear
fellow
said
monsieur
havard
in
a
positive
tone
for
a
logical
mind
that
reasons
coolly
for
one
who
does
not
bewilder
himself
in
a
network
of
fantômas
hypotheses
he
who
killed
brocq
is
assuredly
he
who
has
killed
nichoune
brocq
i
imagine
was
killed
by
someone
lying
in
wait
on
the
top
of
the
arc
de
triomphe
an
accomplice
during
this
time
or
some
hours
before
it
matters
little
had
stolen
the
document
the
ministry
are
looking
for
brocq
knew
corporal
vinson
you
are
aware
of
that
fandor
yes
yes
please
continue
good
vinson
had
the
murdered
nichoune
as
his
mistress
do
you
not
think
the
link
between
these
two
names
is
evident
brocq
and
nichoune
have
died
by
the
same
but
all
this
does
not
exclude
fantômas
as
the
guilty
person
you
go
too
fast
fandor
i
know
who
killed
nichoune
oh
i
say
but
i
do
deuce
take
it
you
do
not
suppose
i
go
by
what
these
officers
of
the
second
bureau
are
doing
in
the
way
of
a
search
do
you
they
fancy
they
are
detectives
oh
that
is
going
too
far
surely
expostulated
fandor
no
asserted
monsieur
havard
who
did
the
deeds
i
know
the
investigations
of
my
own
agents
the
information
obtained
through
the
public
prosecutor
and
the
magistrates
point
to
one
person
vagualame
an
old
sham
beggar
who
has
relations
of
sorts
with
the
second
bureau
fandor
could
scarcely
keep
his
countenance
he
nearly
burst
into
derisive
laughter
vagualame
guilty
monsieur
havard
evidently
had
not
all
the
facts
could
he
possibly
realise
that
vagualame
was
one
of
colonel
hofferman
most
trusted
men
jealous
of
the
second
bureau
and
all
its
works
monsieur
havard
meant
to
carry
off
the
honours
this
time
he
was
going
to
arrest
vagualame
as
the
murderer
of
both
captain
brocq
and
nichoune
and
then
what
a
jolly
blunder
police
headquarters
would
make
what
a
fine
joke
fandor
really
must
help
it
on
he
said
to
himself
only
let
the
police
paralyse
the
action
of
the
second
bureau
agent
old
vagualame
and
i
the
false
corporal
vinson
will
be
all
the
more
free
to
act
you
have
serious
circumstantial
evidence
against
this
person
fandor
asked
with
a
grave
face
very
serious
i
know
for
certain
that
he
saw
nichoune
the
evening
before
her
death
he
was
even
the
last
person
known
to
have
spoken
to
the
singer
i
know
that
he
then
left
châlons
and
has
not
returned
there
i
know
that
he
was
on
good
terms
with
very
shady
people
some
of
whom
are
suspected
of
spying
and
all
fandor
interrupted
if
i
were
in
your
place
chief
and
knew
what
you
seem
to
know
i
would
not
hesitate
a
moment
i
should
arrest
vagualame
monsieur
havard
glance
was
ironical
who
told
you
that
i
had
not
so
decided
at
this
moment
my
best
trackers
are
out
on
vagualame
trail
if
i
run
him
to
earth
he
will
not
be
at
large
long
i
can
promise
you
it
would
end
a
bothersome
affair
and
would
open
the
eyes
of
colonel
hofferman
who
must
be
a
hundred
leagues
from
imagining
that
vagualame
is
the
murderer
of
captain
brocq
and
nichoune
on
this
fandor
and
monsieur
havard
parted
dancing
went
gaily
on
in
the
warm
perfumed
atmosphere
of
the
but
fandor
and
monsieur
havard
colonel
hofferman
and
lieutenant
de
loubersac
had
had
their
serious
interviews
and
had
gone
their
respective
ways
xvii
in
the
stronghold
of
the
enemy
the
curtain
with
its
pictured
red
cock
was
down
lights
were
up
in
the
modern
cinema
concert
hall
rue
des
poissonniers
most
of
the
spectators
were
on
the
move
an
old
man
of
appearance
rose
from
his
seat
beside
a
pretty
girl
elegantly
dressed
he
murmured
i
am
going
out
for
a
smoke
the
girl
nodded
she
stared
at
the
spectators
with
indifferent
eyes
they
were
mostly
women
and
girls
there
was
a
mingled
odour
of
hot
coffee
and
orange
peel
drinks
and
refreshments
for
the
good
of
the
house
were
now
the
order
of
the
evening
the
old
fellow
with
a
shabby
accordion
slung
over
his
bent
shoulders
making
his
way
to
the
exit
was
detective
juve
in
fact
he
had
kept
the
appointment
made
with
bobinette
a
week
ago
this
cinema
entertainment
in
an
unfashionable
quarter
suited
his
purpose
exactly
in
such
an
audience
his
appearance
would
attract
but
little
attention
and
the
long
intervals
of
darkness
were
all
in
his
favour
bobinette
must
not
have
her
suspicions
aroused
marched
up
and
down
outside
the
hall
rubbing
his
hands
with
satisfaction
things
were
going
well
bobinette
had
been
with
him
less
than
an
hour
but
she
had
given
him
an
almost
complete
account
of
her
doings
during
the
past
week
she
announced
that
her
trip
to
the
frontier
had
been
crowned
with
success
that
the
plan
arranged
with
corporal
vinson
had
proved
astonishingly
successful
she
could
not
praise
this
wonderful
vinson
enough
how
intelligent
he
was
say
but
half
a
word
and
he
understood
everything
as
cynical
as
you
please
he
would
stick
at
nothing
declaring
himself
ready
for
anything
regardless
of
consequences
from
this
gathered
that
corporal
vinson
was
a
daring
traitor
was
the
most
scoundrel
imaginable
bobinette
also
told
her
supposed
chief
that
the
moment
for
the
great
stroke
was
at
hand
she
whispered
low
vinson
will
be
in
paris
juve
had
already
learned
that
vinson
was
stationed
at
verdun
was
granted
frequent
leave
and
that
on
the
morning
of
december
he
would
be
in
paris
this
was
the
evening
of
november
bobinette
had
not
said
exactly
what
he
was
coming
to
do
and
juve
feared
to
ask
questions
that
might
arouse
the
girl
suspicions
a
bell
warned
spectators
that
the
interval
was
over
returned
to
his
seat
he
was
saying
to
himself
i
must
know
exactly
what
vinson
is
coming
to
paris
for
after
several
attempts
he
drew
an
important
statement
from
bobinette
he
played
the
part
of
sceptic
the
more
enthusiastically
convinced
bobinette
was
that
the
great
affair
would
be
successful
the
more
sceptical
he
grew
she
committed
herself
to
a
statement
of
extreme
importance
do
i
tell
you
old
unbeliever
that
you
are
that
corporal
vinson
is
to
bring
the
plan
of
the
piece
in
question
the
plan
objected
that
is
good
as
far
as
it
goes
but
that
is
not
sufficient
bobinette
shrugged
her
plump
shoulders
she
was
exasperated
the
noise
of
the
orchestra
covered
the
sound
of
her
imprudently
loud
answers
since
i
tell
you
i
have
in
my
hands
the
piece
of
the
gun
which
is
to
go
to
the
havre
agent
i
expect
you
have
forgotten
the
details
concerning
this
object
the
manufacture
of
it
is
so
complicated
that
without
the
design
for
its
construction
the
piece
would
be
much
like
any
other
we
have
the
piece
i
tell
you
it
is
in
our
hands
we
shall
possess
the
design
of
it
thanks
to
vinson
can
we
possibly
expect
anything
more
complete
than
that
there
was
a
pause
then
bobinette
announced
if
after
that
you
do
not
pay
me
what
you
owe
me
you
can
be
sure
i
shall
not
serve
you
ever
again
promised
immediate
payment
but
said
he
to
himself
her
remuneration
will
not
take
the
form
she
expects
to
mislead
the
curious
the
serious
talk
of
this
incongruous
pair
was
punctuated
by
remarks
having
no
connection
with
the
real
matter
in
hand
juve
one
idea
now
was
to
see
this
piece
of
a
gun
for
himself
when
bobinette
at
last
grasped
this
she
stared
at
him
with
bewildered
eyes
but
what
are
you
thinking
of
vagualame
i
do
not
carry
the
thing
about
with
me
i
think
on
the
contrary
that
you
keep
it
well
hidden
in
your
own
room
assuredly
confirmed
bobinette
i
mean
to
see
it
i
expect
you
to
agree
to
that
declared
you
intend
to
come
to
bobinette
looked
terrified
exactly
but
when
do
you
recollect
vagualame
that
i
shall
have
to
hand
it
over
early
morning
there
is
time
for
me
to
see
it
between
then
and
now
see
it
i
must
examine
it
hold
it
in
my
hands
i
will
i
have
my
most
excellent
reasons
for
this
juve
meant
to
seize
the
piece
of
a
gun
and
arrest
the
guilty
girl
bobinette
dared
not
openly
kick
against
her
chief
iron
determination
but
she
made
another
attempt
to
turn
him
from
his
purpose
you
know
quite
well
that
i
am
living
in
the
baron
de
house
the
least
noise
an
alarm
raised
and
i
would
not
answer
for
the
consequences
we
should
almost
certainly
be
caught
we
have
nothing
to
fear
an
hour
from
now
i
wish
to
be
in
your
room
but
how
shall
you
get
into
it
asked
bobinette
who
was
giving
way
before
this
persistent
attack
you
will
return
alone
you
will
go
up
to
your
room
i
know
whereabouts
it
is
you
will
leave
the
window
half
open
i
will
enter
your
room
by
the
window
bobinette
saw
this
was
possible
though
risky
a
large
gutter
pipe
ran
up
the
whole
height
of
the
house
it
was
fastened
to
the
wall
by
projecting
of
solid
iron
for
an
agile
man
this
was
simply
a
staircase
bobinette
was
aware
of
this
in
the
course
of
her
adventurous
life
she
had
been
initiated
into
all
sorts
of
tricks
and
stratagems
she
was
practiced
in
every
form
of
gymnastic
exercise
vagualame
could
and
would
reach
her
room
by
the
ladder
it
was
not
too
difficult
but
it
was
a
risky
undertaking
for
and
particularly
from
the
esplanade
des
invalides
a
climber
might
be
seen
an
alarm
raised
and
the
police
would
intervene
and
bobinette
left
the
movies
hall
at
ten
in
a
taxi
they
discussed
how
best
to
effect
an
entrance
into
the
de
naarboveck
mansion
stuck
to
his
original
idea
the
taxi
drew
up
at
the
bridge
paid
the
driver
bobinette
hurried
away
slipped
into
the
house
and
went
straight
up
to
her
room
she
busied
herself
with
the
preparations
agreed
on
whereby
vagualame
could
the
more
easily
effect
an
entrance
in
his
turn
safe
in
her
room
bobinette
experienced
a
strange
a
penetrating
emotion
she
felt
as
though
something
around
her
in
which
she
had
moved
safely
was
cracking
with
a
sudden
and
terrible
lucidity
she
saw
herself
marching
forward
powerless
to
draw
back
marching
helplessly
towards
an
abyss
an
abyss
which
was
about
to
engulf
her
she
trembled
trembled
violently
she
was
encompassed
by
vague
and
agonizing
terrors
out
in
the
night
juve
wandering
restlessly
awaited
his
hour
this
time
ah
this
time
he
murmured
i
shall
be
in
the
stronghold
of
the
enemy
at
last
xviii
in
the
name
of
the
law
the
baron
de
naarboveck
and
his
daughter
wilhelmine
were
comfortably
seated
before
a
wood
fire
in
the
library
so
numerous
were
their
social
engagements
they
rarely
had
time
for
a
quiet
talk
together
wilhelmine
was
in
good
spirits
de
naarboveck
listened
with
an
indulgent
smile
to
her
vivacious
account
of
the
little
happenings
and
doings
of
her
day
presently
a
more
serious
subject
came
up
for
discussion
the
word
marriage
was
mentioned
wilhelmine
blushed
and
lowered
her
eyes
while
the
baron
sounded
her
teasingly
on
her
feelings
for
de
loubersac
my
dear
child
said
the
baron
this
young
officer
has
a
fine
future
before
him
he
is
charming
is
sufficiently
well
connected
adequately
endowed
with
this
world
goods
bears
a
known
name
you
would
find
him
a
suitable
match
wilhelmine
kept
silence
an
anxious
preoccupied
look
replaced
her
bright
expression
her
animation
had
died
down
at
last
she
murmured
dear
father
i
have
nothing
to
hide
from
you
and
i
willingly
confess
that
i
love
henri
with
my
whole
heart
i
know
he
loves
me
also
but
i
ask
myself
whether
he
will
not
raise
objections
when
he
learns
my
life
secret
my
dear
child
there
is
nothing
in
this
secret
which
impugns
your
honor
you
are
not
the
responsible
party
if
up
to
the
present
i
have
thought
it
well
to
introduce
you
to
my
friends
as
my
de
naarboveck
stopped
short
the
library
door
had
opened
a
footman
appeared
and
announced
a
woman
has
just
arrived
with
her
son
and
wishes
to
see
mademoiselle
or
monsieur
she
says
it
is
the
new
groom
she
has
brought
the
baron
looked
puzzled
wilhelmine
rose
i
forgot
to
tell
you
i
was
expecting
the
stable
boy
this
evening
he
replaces
charles
she
turned
to
the
impassive
footman
please
ask
mademoiselle
berthe
to
attend
to
these
persons
they
come
late
much
too
late
mademoiselle
will
please
excuse
me
for
troubling
her
replied
the
footman
but
mademoiselle
is
still
out
in
that
case
i
will
see
them
myself
though
it
is
an
unconscionable
hour
not
at
all
a
good
the
woman
and
her
son
had
been
shown
into
the
when
wilhelmine
entered
the
pair
bowed
respectfully
the
groom
was
a
lad
and
gave
the
impression
of
being
superior
to
the
common
run
of
his
class
and
calling
agreeably
surprised
wilhelmine
asked
to
see
his
references
she
wished
to
make
sure
that
they
were
in
order
preliminaries
through
the
medium
of
an
agent
had
been
gone
into
some
days
before
the
woman
displayed
them
announcing
in
a
loud
harsh
voice
i
am
his
mother
this
mother
was
as
unpleasant
to
behold
as
her
son
was
the
contrary
thought
wilhelmine
she
was
a
stout
vulgar
clumsy
creature
enveloped
in
a
large
shawl
of
many
colours
which
did
not
hide
her
obesity
the
old
face
seemed
all
paint
and
large
spectacles
and
peering
eyes
this
grotesque
visage
was
shaded
by
a
flowered
veil
what
a
horrid
old
creature
thought
wilhelmine
as
she
listened
with
scarcely
concealed
distaste
to
the
woman
voluble
praises
of
her
son
qualities
according
to
her
he
was
a
marvel
of
marvels
monsieur
de
naarboveck
remained
in
the
library
pacing
up
and
down
smoking
an
expensive
cigar
wilhelmine
did
not
return
feeling
sleepy
he
quitted
the
room
and
went
down
the
long
gallery
at
a
leisurely
pace
the
reception
rooms
opened
on
to
it
the
spacious
entrance
hall
was
visible
from
the
balustrade
bordering
this
gallery
the
baron
stopped
he
listened
surely
there
were
voices
in
animated
discussion
in
the
vestibule
yes
men
were
arguing
with
the
porter
insisting
the
porter
was
coming
up
the
baron
went
down
to
meet
him
two
men
in
derby
hats
and
tightly
buttoned
overcoats
confronted
him
they
carried
neither
stick
nor
umbrella
their
hands
were
gloveless
there
was
an
air
of
suppressed
haste
about
them
they
saluted
one
of
the
two
offered
his
card
the
baron
read
michel
detective
force
police
kindly
follow
me
gentlemen
de
naarboveck
walked
quietly
up
the
grand
staircase
his
hand
on
its
superb
balustrade
the
two
men
followed
in
silence
the
baron
opened
the
door
saw
it
was
empty
entered
signed
to
the
policemen
to
follow
and
closed
the
door
to
what
do
i
owe
the
honour
of
your
visit
gentlemen
de
naarboveck
tone
was
icy
inspector
michel
spoke
you
must
pardon
us
monsieur
only
a
matter
of
the
most
serious
importance
exceptionally
serious
could
have
brought
us
to
your
house
at
so
late
an
hour
we
hold
a
warrant
and
with
your
permission
we
shall
proceed
to
make
an
arrest
de
naarboveck
looked
fixedly
at
the
policemen
gentlemen
that
you
should
invade
my
house
at
such
an
hour
this
matter
must
indeed
be
of
singular
importance
he
said
stiffly
then
in
a
voice
quivering
with
sarcasm
he
enquired
am
i
to
be
permitted
to
know
what
it
is
all
about
there
is
no
harm
in
asking
that
monsieur
replied
inspector
michel
in
a
tone
the
individual
we
have
come
to
arrest
here
is
a
ruffian
wanted
for
a
couple
of
murders
that
of
a
captain
brocq
and
that
of
a
little
singer
called
nichoune
that
this
statement
had
upset
the
baron
was
evident
he
had
grown
white
to
the
lips
inspector
michel
realised
that
the
idea
of
this
murderer
having
taken
refuge
in
his
house
must
have
given
the
rich
diplomat
a
horrid
surprise
he
continued
his
statement
the
individual
we
have
come
to
arrest
is
known
under
the
name
of
vagualame
vagualame
stammered
de
naarboveck
he
staggered
slightly
and
caught
at
the
mantelpiece
for
support
how
upset
the
baron
is
thought
inspector
michel
hardly
to
be
wondered
at
he
hurried
on
with
his
statement
we
were
on
the
watch
on
the
esplanade
des
invalides
about
half
an
hour
ago
nothing
to
do
with
this
affair
when
we
saw
vagualame
approaching
this
house
you
saw
vagualame
exclaimed
the
baron
with
the
amazed
incredulous
look
of
a
man
who
finds
himself
suddenly
faced
by
a
set
of
lunatics
but
it
it
is
he
gasped
it
is
so
monsieur
asserted
inspector
michel
this
old
ruffian
after
lingering
about
a
few
minutes
to
assure
himself
that
he
was
not
being
followed
we
managed
to
conceal
ourselves
sufficiently
behind
the
trees
vagualame
effected
a
most
suspicious
entry
into
your
house
monsieur
he
climbed
the
wall
with
the
help
of
a
and
entered
the
house
through
a
window
on
the
third
floor
you
permit
monsieur
that
we
take
action
at
once
without
waiting
for
the
baron
authorisation
inspector
michel
made
a
sign
to
his
colleagues
they
removed
their
overcoats
placed
them
on
a
chair
drew
out
their
revolvers
and
left
the
room
the
detectives
were
on
the
first
steps
of
the
flight
of
stairs
leading
to
the
third
story
when
they
heard
voices
just
above
them
the
piercing
notes
of
the
new
groom
mother
mingled
with
the
refined
accents
of
wilhelmine
de
naarboveck
who
in
the
absence
of
her
companion
was
about
to
show
the
new
groom
the
room
allotted
to
him
in
such
matters
wilhelmine
was
more
punctilious
than
most
did
you
hear
vagualame
bobinette
paled
could
her
overstrung
nerves
be
playing
her
tricks
no
there
certainly
were
voices
voices
on
the
floor
below
strange
voices
whose
why
vagualame
was
seated
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
much
at
his
ease
his
accordion
lay
on
the
floor
he
met
bobinette
urgency
with
a
shrug
bah
with
a
despairing
gesture
the
terrified
girl
moved
close
to
the
old
man
do
you
understand
they
have
seen
you
they
are
after
you
master
bobinette
bent
forward
looked
vagualame
in
the
eyes
started
drew
back
with
a
jerk
this
was
not
the
vagualame
she
knew
not
her
master
who
then
who
but
an
enemy
a
police
spy
horror
she
was
trapped
lost
her
heart
was
beating
frightfully
beating
to
bursting
point
were
her
knees
going
to
give
way
they
should
not
play
the
poltroon
never
rage
boiled
up
in
her
brain
and
will
were
afire
she
submit
to
the
humiliation
of
arrest
the
agonies
of
the
tortures
of
imprisonment
in
noumea
not
bobinette
never
never
never
almost
simultaneously
with
her
backward
jerk
from
the
stranger
eyes
of
this
vagualame
bobinette
darted
to
a
chiffonier
slipped
her
hand
into
a
drawer
among
ribbons
and
laces
seized
a
revolver
and
snatched
it
out
agile
as
a
panther
vagualame
leaped
at
the
girl
caught
her
wrist
in
a
grip
like
a
vice
the
pain
of
it
was
intense
bobinette
dropped
her
weapon
no
more
of
this
nonsense
commanded
vagualame
in
a
hard
voice
keep
cool
i
tell
you
go
on
to
the
landing
look
over
see
what
is
happening
you
are
not
to
be
afraid
struck
speechless
bobinette
stared
at
the
old
man
who
commanded
her
as
a
master
and
might
stand
by
her
as
an
accomplice
but
those
terrifying
eyes
were
not
the
eyes
of
her
own
vagualame
no
how
to
act
she
was
left
no
choice
the
old
man
was
pushing
her
relentlessly
towards
the
door
he
must
be
obeyed
listening
on
the
alert
remained
in
the
room
ready
to
conceal
himself
behind
the
curtains
who
were
these
mounting
the
stairs
some
of
the
household
suppose
bobinette
agitation
was
so
marked
that
it
aroused
their
suspicions
and
his
presence
was
revealed
should
the
position
become
untenable
he
would
leave
by
the
window
close
to
which
he
was
standing
make
his
way
over
the
roofs
to
a
neighbouring
house
but
confound
it
neither
the
gun
piece
would
be
in
his
hands
nor
would
he
have
learned
where
bobinette
had
her
rendezvous
with
corporal
vinson
next
morning
bobinette
was
swaying
in
the
doorway
as
though
the
landing
were
ploughshares
to
be
walked
on
the
ordeal
was
beyond
her
four
persons
set
foot
on
the
landing
a
peremptory
order
from
de
naarboveck
had
caused
wilhelmine
to
descend
inspector
michel
and
his
colleague
stared
at
the
individuals
in
whose
company
they
found
themselves
the
young
groom
and
his
amazing
mother
with
a
caricatural
gesture
of
disdain
and
an
air
this
corpulent
personage
demanded
stridently
who
are
these
gentlemen
inspector
michel
looked
the
outrageous
creature
up
and
down
who
are
you
madame
what
are
you
doing
here
the
inspector
tone
was
severity
itself
juve
behind
his
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
ah
michel
has
it
in
hand
that
all
right
the
groom
mother
was
taken
aback
she
hesitated
thereupon
inspector
michel
stated
his
name
and
rank
on
that
the
large
body
of
this
irrepressible
personage
made
straight
for
him
caught
him
familiarly
by
the
neck
and
whispered
in
his
ear
the
effect
of
the
whispered
words
was
to
put
inspector
michel
out
of
countenance
he
looked
abashed
he
was
annoyed
his
tone
was
one
of
protest
i
recognise
you
now
certainly
monsieur
but
since
when
have
you
taken
it
upon
yourself
to
to
start
operations
of
the
kind
we
have
in
hand
the
representatives
of
police
headquarters
the
woman
retort
was
haughty
i
belong
to
the
information
department
of
the
second
bureau
the
second
bureau
does
not
make
arrests
not
that
i
am
aware
of
captain
the
obstreperous
mother
of
the
pretended
groom
was
captain
loreuil
pointing
to
his
young
companion
captain
loreuil
announced
this
gentleman
belongs
to
the
secret
service
department
of
the
home
office
but
what
really
matters
inspector
is
that
we
are
losing
time
let
us
effect
a
capture
the
capture
is
the
thing
the
distracted
bobinette
still
swaying
in
the
doorway
failed
to
grasp
the
full
meaning
of
what
these
intruders
were
saying
inspector
michel
marched
up
to
the
trembling
girl
mademoiselle
are
you
alone
in
your
room
bobinette
nodded
she
was
incapable
of
speech
the
inspector
ignored
the
nod
brushed
past
her
stepped
into
the
room
and
glanced
rapidly
round
bobinette
with
fear
watched
the
proceedings
she
saw
the
stout
woman
moving
the
chairs
looking
under
the
bed
shaking
the
hangings
the
fussy
obnoxious
creature
tore
apart
the
vagualame
was
exposed
to
view
he
had
not
escaped
then
they
dragged
the
old
fellow
from
his
they
promptly
handcuffed
him
vagualame
in
the
name
of
the
law
i
arrest
you
declared
inspector
michel
captain
loreuil
shouted
in
his
natural
voice
which
issuing
from
this
apparent
woman
had
a
ludicrous
effect
ha
at
last
we
have
got
him
did
not
budge
with
inward
joy
he
awaited
the
arrest
of
bobinette
things
go
well
he
thought
if
not
so
well
as
old
michel
believes
comrade
juve
in
the
bracelets
and
vagualame
free
but
he
holds
bobinette
in
his
hand
the
old
ruffian
accomplice
unmasked
what
was
this
could
juve
believe
his
ears
michel
apologising
to
this
guilty
creature
felicitating
her
on
her
escape
from
clutches
what
the
deuce
ah
mademoiselle
you
never
suspected
who
was
so
near
you
now
did
you
inspector
michel
was
saying
to
bobinette
whose
was
beginning
to
return
you
have
certainly
had
a
narrow
escape
he
went
on
with
a
congratulatory
smile
this
old
ruffian
meant
to
murder
you
i
am
convinced
pointing
triumphantly
to
he
added
but
vagualame
can
not
harm
you
now
the
law
has
got
him
the
law
has
saved
you
mademoiselle
inspector
michel
made
a
sign
his
colleague
and
the
home
office
detective
dragged
juve
from
the
room
juve
offered
no
resistance
that
michel
is
an
idiot
the
completest
of
idiots
he
thought
come
along
now
we
are
off
to
the
dépôt
commanded
michel
shaking
by
the
shoulder
juve
was
about
to
tear
off
his
false
beard
make
himself
known
and
get
bobinette
arrested
he
thought
better
of
it
he
was
pretty
sure
the
girl
doubted
his
genuineness
this
arrest
under
her
eyes
would
persuade
her
that
the
vagualame
they
were
taking
to
prison
was
the
real
vagualame
better
that
she
should
cherish
this
delusion
for
the
present
once
out
of
the
de
naarboveck
house
he
could
explain
matters
to
his
colleagues
thinking
thus
encircled
by
watchful
policemen
descended
the
stairs
on
the
first
floor
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
baron
and
his
daughter
in
the
de
naarboveck
bearing
was
dignified
wilhelmine
seemed
terribly
frightened
there
was
a
scared
hunted
look
on
her
pallid
face
behind
in
his
handcuffs
followed
the
judging
it
unwise
to
make
himself
known
to
the
master
and
mistress
of
the
house
captain
loreuil
played
his
part
vigorously
to
the
last
close
on
juve
heels
he
came
shouting
this
is
a
nice
kind
of
shop
this
is
you
shall
not
remain
here
sosthène
my
child
come
then
with
your
mother
she
will
find
you
a
very
different
situation
to
this
my
poor
sosthène
majestically
with
a
wave
of
her
arm
signifying
disdainful
rejection
the
drew
her
shawl
of
many
colours
about
her
corpulent
person
and
sailed
out
of
the
de
naarboveck
mansion
meanwhile
up
on
the
third
floor
a
puzzled
confused
battered
bobinette
was
recovering
from
the
shocks
and
terrors
of
the
evening
she
lay
back
in
an
trying
to
piece
things
together
two
things
were
clear
vagualame
was
arrested
she
was
free
and
with
the
famous
gun
piece
still
in
her
possession
she
would
obey
orders
received
she
would
take
the
piece
to
havre
accompanied
by
corporal
vinson
who
would
bring
the
plan
of
the
apparatus
bobinette
had
bent
her
head
to
the
storm
she
now
raised
it
proudly
xix
the
mysterious
abbé
fandor
half
opened
his
eyes
was
he
dreaming
this
was
not
the
barrack
dormitory
with
its
gaunt
walls
and
morning
clamour
of
course
he
was
in
a
bedroom
of
a
cheap
hotel
in
paris
cretonne
curtains
shaded
the
window
a
ray
of
light
was
reflected
in
a
hanging
mirror
of
scant
dimensions
decidedly
the
worse
for
wear
below
it
stood
a
washstand
on
its
cracked
and
dirty
marble
top
could
be
seen
a
chipped
and
basin
and
soapdish
a
lopsided
table
occupied
the
middle
of
the
room
on
a
chair
by
his
bed
lay
uniform
his
valise
reposed
on
a
rickety
chest
of
drawers
fandor
was
loath
to
rouse
himself
his
bed
was
warm
while
about
the
room
icy
draughts
from
door
and
window
were
circulating
freely
he
would
have
to
get
up
presently
dress
and
keep
his
appointment
his
appointment
ah
wide
awake
now
our
journalist
considered
the
situation
a
couple
of
days
ago
the
adjutant
had
announced
corporal
vinson
you
have
eight
days
leave
you
can
quit
barracks
at
noon
fandor
had
been
given
leave
several
times
already
he
merely
replied
thanks
lieutenant
he
then
looked
out
for
a
post
card
from
the
spies
appointing
a
rendezvous
a
letter
was
handed
to
him
by
the
post
sergeant
the
letter
commenced
dearest
ah
thought
fandor
now
i
am
indeed
a
soldier
i
receive
a
love
letter
his
unknown
correspondent
wrote
it
is
so
long
since
i
saw
you
but
as
you
have
eight
days
leave
i
can
make
up
for
lost
time
would
you
not
like
to
arrange
a
meeting
for
your
first
morning
in
paris
you
will
go
as
usual
will
you
not
to
the
army
and
navy
hotel
boulevard
barbès
you
will
find
me
at
eleven
to
the
minute
in
the
rue
de
rivoli
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
castiglione
we
might
breakfast
together
to
our
early
meeting
then
i
send
you
all
my
kisses
the
signature
was
illegible
fandor
understood
the
hidden
meaning
he
was
to
hand
over
the
design
as
he
had
promised
but
he
had
decided
to
put
them
off
with
a
concocted
design
of
his
own
he
must
hasten
now
to
the
appointed
meeting
place
fandor
rose
at
once
whilst
dressing
he
decided
i
shall
go
in
mufti
be
jérôme
fandor
undisguised
better
be
on
the
safe
side
this
may
be
an
trap
of
course
i
shall
miss
my
rendezvous
but
will
not
be
put
off
so
easily
they
will
write
at
once
making
a
new
appointment
then
i
shall
go
as
corporal
vinson
if
i
think
it
the
wisest
thing
to
do
fandor
ran
down
the
rickety
stairs
he
learned
from
octave
the
hotel
porter
that
his
room
had
been
paid
for
three
days
in
advance
saying
he
would
not
be
back
until
the
evening
probably
fandor
stepped
on
to
the
boulevard
barbès
and
hailed
a
cab
take
me
to
the
foot
of
the
vendôme
column
he
ordered
arrived
at
the
rendezvous
fandor
sauntered
along
awaiting
developments
presently
he
noticed
in
the
distance
a
figure
he
seemed
to
know
it
was
moving
towards
him
my
word
i
was
not
mistaken
thought
fandor
watching
the
young
woman
she
also
was
sauntering
under
the
arcades
of
the
rue
de
rivoli
glancing
at
the
fascinating
display
of
feminine
apparel
in
the
shop
windows
fandor
drew
aside
watching
her
every
movement
and
swearing
softly
the
girl
came
nearer
fandor
curiosity
made
him
make
himself
known
that
he
might
see
what
she
would
do
he
showed
himself
and
saluted
with
an
impressive
wave
of
his
hat
exclaiming
why
it
is
mademoiselle
berthe
the
girl
stopped
why
yes
it
is
monsieur
fandor
how
are
you
flourishing
thanks
i
need
not
ask
how
you
are
mademoiselle
you
bloom
bobinette
smiled
how
is
it
i
find
you
here
at
this
time
of
day
why
mademoiselle
just
in
the
same
way
as
you
happen
to
be
here
the
fancy
took
me
to
pass
this
way
i
often
do
oh
cried
bobinette
in
an
apologetic
tone
now
i
am
going
to
ask
you
how
it
is
you
have
never
responded
to
monsieur
de
invitation
to
take
a
cup
of
tea
with
us
now
and
then
we
were
speaking
of
you
only
the
other
day
monsieur
de
naarboveck
said
he
never
saw
your
signature
in
now
that
most
probably
you
were
travelling
i
have
in
fact
just
returned
to
paris
are
all
well
at
monsieur
de
naarboveck
has
mademoiselle
wilhelmine
recovered
from
the
sad
shock
of
captain
brocq
death
his
end
was
so
sudden
oh
yes
monsieur
fandor
would
have
liked
to
find
out
the
exact
nature
of
intimacy
with
the
officer
also
to
what
extent
she
was
in
love
with
henri
de
loubersac
but
as
she
showed
by
her
manner
that
she
did
not
relish
this
talk
either
because
of
the
turn
it
had
taken
or
because
it
was
held
in
a
public
place
fandor
had
to
take
his
leave
bobinette
went
off
fandor
noted
the
time
as
he
continued
his
saunter
it
was
a
quarter
to
twelve
of
the
few
there
was
not
one
who
merited
a
second
glance
or
thought
impatiently
he
waited
five
ten
minutes
at
one
he
betook
himself
to
his
hotel
there
he
found
an
express
message
unsigned
it
ran
darling
my
dear
love
forgive
me
for
not
meeting
you
this
morning
in
the
rue
de
rivoli
as
arranged
it
was
impossible
return
to
the
same
place
at
two
i
will
be
punctual
i
promise
you
of
course
you
will
wear
your
uniform
i
want
to
see
how
handsome
you
look
in
it
i
do
not
like
this
thought
fandor
rereading
the
message
why
ask
me
to
come
in
uniform
do
they
know
i
came
in
mufti
this
morning
i
shall
go
again
but
i
think
it
is
high
time
i
returned
to
civilian
life
it
was
two
by
the
clock
on
the
refuge
in
the
rue
de
rivoli
emerged
from
the
metropolitan
and
crossed
to
the
corner
of
the
rue
castiglione
he
took
a
few
steps
under
the
arcade
saying
to
himself
punctual
to
the
tick
and
in
uniform
the
meeting
should
come
off
all
right
this
time
a
delicately
gloved
hand
was
placed
on
his
shoulder
and
a
voice
said
my
dear
corporal
how
are
you
turned
sharply
and
faced
a
priest
he
recognised
the
abbé
it
was
he
of
the
verdun
very
well
and
you
monsieur
your
friend
is
he
with
you
he
is
not
my
dear
corporal
is
he
at
verdun
the
abbé
reply
was
a
look
of
displeasure
i
do
not
know
where
he
is
he
said
sharply
after
a
pause
but
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
corporal
he
went
on
in
a
more
amiable
tone
we
are
going
to
take
a
little
journey
together
this
news
perturbed
it
was
not
to
his
liking
the
abbé
took
him
by
the
arm
you
will
excuse
my
absence
this
morning
to
keep
the
appointment
was
impossible
ah
hand
me
the
promised
document
will
you
that
is
it
very
good
thank
you
by
the
by
corporal
there
you
see
our
special
train
the
priest
pointed
to
a
superb
drawn
up
alongside
the
pavement
a
chauffeur
was
seated
at
the
wheel
shall
we
get
in
we
have
a
fairly
long
way
to
go
and
it
is
important
that
we
arrive
punctually
fandor
could
do
nothing
but
agree
they
seated
themselves
the
abbé
shared
a
heavy
travelling
rug
we
will
wrap
ourselves
up
well
said
he
it
is
far
from
warm
and
there
is
no
need
to
catch
cold
it
is
not
part
of
our
programme
you
can
start
now
chauffeur
we
are
ready
once
in
motion
the
abbé
pointed
to
a
voluminous
package
which
prevented
fandor
from
stretching
his
legs
we
can
change
places
from
time
to
time
for
you
can
not
be
comfortable
with
this
package
encumbering
the
floor
of
the
car
like
this
oh
replied
one
takes
things
as
they
come
but
we
should
be
much
more
comfortable
if
we
fastened
this
rather
clumsy
piece
of
baggage
to
the
front
seat
beside
the
chauffeur
who
can
keep
an
eye
on
it
corporal
you
can
not
be
thinking
of
what
you
are
saying
the
priest
reply
was
delivered
in
a
dry
authoritative
voice
i
have
put
my
foot
in
it
thought
fandor
i
should
just
like
to
know
how
he
was
about
to
speak
the
abbé
cut
in
i
am
very
tired
corporal
so
excuse
me
if
i
doze
a
little
in
an
hour
or
so
i
shall
be
quite
refreshed
there
will
be
ample
time
for
a
talk
after
that
fandor
could
but
agree
the
car
was
speeding
up
the
avenue
des
they
were
leaving
paris
for
what
destination
does
your
chauffeur
know
the
route
monsieur
i
hope
so
why
because
i
could
direct
him
i
could
find
my
way
about
any
of
these
suburbs
with
my
eyes
shut
very
well
see
that
he
keeps
on
the
right
road
we
are
going
towards
rouen
with
that
the
abbé
wrapped
himself
in
his
share
of
the
ample
rug
and
closed
his
eyes
fandor
sat
still
as
a
mouse
with
all
the
food
for
thought
he
required
why
rouen
why
were
they
taking
him
there
what
is
this
mysterious
package
which
must
remain
out
of
sight
at
the
bottom
of
the
car
fandor
tried
to
follow
its
outline
with
the
toe
of
his
boot
it
was
protected
by
a
thick
wrapping
of
straw
then
who
was
this
abbé
his
speech
showed
he
was
french
he
wore
his
cassock
with
the
ease
of
long
habit
he
was
young
his
hand
was
the
delicate
hand
of
a
churchman
not
coarsened
by
manual
labour
fandor
plunged
in
reflections
lost
all
sense
of
time
the
car
sped
on
its
way
devouring
the
miles
fleetly
no
sooner
out
of
paris
than
was
cleared
mantes
left
behind
as
they
were
approaching
bonniéres
fandor
whose
eyes
had
been
fixed
on
the
interminable
route
as
though
at
some
turn
of
the
road
he
might
catch
sight
of
their
real
destination
now
felt
that
the
abbé
was
watching
the
landscape
through
eyes
you
are
awake
then
monsieur
observed
i
was
wondering
where
we
were
we
are
coming
to
bonniéres
good
the
abbé
sat
up
flung
his
rug
aside
do
as
i
do
corporal
do
not
fold
up
the
rug
throw
it
over
our
package
prying
eyes
will
not
suspect
its
presence
with
the
most
stupid
air
in
the
world
fandor
asked
must
it
not
be
seen
then
of
course
not
and
at
bonniéres
we
must
be
on
guard
the
police
there
are
merciless
they
arrest
everyone
who
exceeds
the
speed
limit
nor
do
we
wish
to
arouse
their
curiosity
about
us
personally
there
is
a
number
of
troops
stationed
here
the
colonel
is
notorious
for
his
strictness
he
is
correctness
personified
stared
questionably
at
the
abbé
but
you
do
not
seem
to
understand
anything
corporal
vinson
he
cried
in
an
irritated
tone
whatever
i
say
seems
to
send
you
into
a
state
of
stupefaction
i
shall
never
do
anything
with
you
you
are
hopeless
ah
here
is
bonniéres
once
outside
the
town
i
will
give
you
some
useful
explanations
a
bare
three
minutes
after
leaving
bonniéres
behind
the
abbè
turned
to
fandor
and
asked
in
a
low
voice
what
do
you
think
is
in
that
package
corporal
good
heavens
monsieur
corporal
that
contains
a
fortune
for
you
and
for
me
a
piece
of
artillery
the
mouthpiece
of
rapid
firer
you
see
its
importance
we
sleep
in
the
outskirts
of
rouen
we
leave
early
for
havre
as
i
am
known
there
corporal
we
shall
have
to
separate
you
will
go
with
the
driver
to
the
nez
there
you
will
find
a
in
charge
of
a
friendly
sailor
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
hand
over
this
package
to
him
he
will
make
for
the
open
sea
where
he
will
deliver
it
into
the
right
involuntarily
fandor
drew
away
from
the
priestly
spy
the
statements
just
made
to
him
were
of
so
grave
a
nature
the
adventure
in
which
he
found
himself
involved
was
so
dangerous
so
nefarious
that
fandor
thrilled
with
terror
and
disgust
he
kept
silence
he
was
thinking
suddenly
he
saw
his
way
clear
between
havre
and
the
nez
i
must
get
rid
of
this
gun
piece
however
interesting
my
investigations
are
i
can
not
possibly
deliver
such
a
thing
to
the
enemy
to
a
foreign
power
death
for
preference
his
companion
broke
in
and
now
corporal
i
fancy
you
fully
understand
how
awkward
it
would
be
for
you
much
more
so
than
for
me
if
this
package
were
opened
because
you
are
a
soldier
and
in
uniform
fandor
showed
an
unflinching
front
but
a
wave
of
positive
anguish
rushed
over
him
this
cursed
abbé
has
me
in
his
net
he
thought
like
it
or
not
i
must
follow
him
now
i
am
regularly
let
in
as
a
civilian
as
fandor
the
journalist
i
might
go
to
the
first
military
dépôt
i
can
come
at
and
state
that
i
had
discovered
a
priest
who
was
going
to
hand
over
to
a
foreign
power
an
important
piece
of
artillery
the
pretended
vinson
would
have
done
the
trick
and
would
then
vanish
but
in
uniform
they
would
certainly
accuse
me
of
suspicious
traffic
with
spies
they
would
confine
me
cell
me
i
should
have
the
work
of
the
world
to
obtain
a
release
under
six
months
another
point
why
had
they
chosen
him
corporal
vinson
as
they
believed
for
such
a
mission
assuredly
the
spies
possessed
a
thousand
other
agents
capable
of
carrying
triumphantly
through
this
dangerous
mission
this
delivery
of
a
stolen
piece
of
ordnance
to
a
sailor
spy
in
the
pay
of
a
foreign
power
inimical
to
france
it
was
horrible
abominable
this
spy
traffic
only
to
think
of
it
soiled
one
soul
fandor
sickened
at
the
realisation
of
what
was
involved
that
this
betrayal
of
france
was
not
a
solitary
instance
that
there
must
be
a
hundred
betrayals
going
on
at
that
very
moment
that
france
was
being
bought
and
sold
in
a
hundred
ways
for
judas
money
france
his
thoughts
turned
shudderingly
away
from
such
hell
depths
of
treachery
he
brought
his
mind
to
bear
on
other
points
why
after
so
much
mystery
such
precautions
does
this
judas
of
an
abbé
disclose
the
contents
of
that
damnable
package
before
its
delivery
why
this
halt
in
the
outskirts
of
rouen
when
a
quick
run
a
quick
handing
over
of
the
package
is
so
essential
with
such
a
powerful
machine
why
this
stop
in
a
journey
of
some
kilometres
fandor
felt
a
cold
shiver
run
down
his
spine
suppose
this
abbé
is
playing
a
trick
on
me
if
yesterday
no
matter
when
i
have
betrayed
myself
if
these
people
have
discovered
my
identity
if
knowing
that
i
am
not
vinson
but
fandor
they
have
made
me
put
on
uniform
placed
in
the
car
with
me
a
compromising
portion
of
a
gun
and
are
going
to
hand
me
over
to
the
military
authorities
either
at
rouen
or
elsewhere
the
abbé
comfortably
ensconced
in
the
corner
was
slumbering
again
fandor
cast
stealthy
glances
at
his
companion
considering
him
carefully
now
he
came
to
examine
him
surely
this
priest
face
had
a
queer
look
the
eyebrows
were
too
regular
painted
how
delicate
his
skin
not
the
slightest
trace
of
a
beard
a
shoe
the
traditional
shoe
of
the
priest
was
visible
below
the
cassock
that
was
all
right
but
how
slender
his
ankle
fandor
pulled
himself
up
what
would
he
imagine
next
true
he
was
wise
to
suspect
everything
everybody
test
them
try
them
in
this
terrible
position
he
had
got
himself
into
nevertheless
he
must
keep
a
clear
head
the
car
was
passing
through
a
village
the
abbé
opened
his
eyes
monsieur
declared
fandor
i
am
frozen
to
death
would
you
object
to
our
stopping
a
minute
so
that
i
might
swallow
a
glass
of
rum
the
abbé
signalled
the
driver
the
car
stopped
before
a
little
inn
the
innkeeper
appeared
bring
the
driver
a
cognac
ordered
the
priest
give
monsieur
a
glass
of
rum
you
may
pour
me
out
a
glass
of
aniseed
cordial
aniseed
cordial
thought
fandor
that
is
a
liqueur
for
priests
youths
and
women
in
an
hour
said
the
abbé
we
shall
be
at
rouen
we
shall
pass
through
the
town
a
few
kilometres
further
on
at
barentin
we
shall
halt
for
the
night
i
know
a
very
good
little
hotel
there
fandor
refrained
from
comment
what
he
thought
was
a
fig
for
barentin
if
i
see
the
least
sign
that
this
little
fellow
is
going
to
give
me
the
slip
leave
me
for
a
minute
if
it
looks
as
though
he
were
going
to
warn
the
authorities
i
know
someone
who
will
take
to
flight
and
how
xx
man
or
woman
kilometres
succeeded
kilometres
in
endless
procession
ceaselessly
the
landscapes
unrolled
themselves
like
views
on
a
cinema
film
swiftly
regularly
relentlessly
the
car
sped
forward
again
the
priest
with
eyes
snuggled
into
his
cushions
fandor
felt
strangely
drowsy
this
was
due
he
thought
to
the
long
journey
in
the
open
air
and
to
a
nervous
fatigue
induced
by
the
tense
emotions
of
the
day
the
nuisance
is
thought
he
that
no
sooner
shall
i
lay
my
head
on
the
pillow
than
i
shall
be
snoring
like
the
seven
sleepers
the
car
continued
to
advance
after
a
sharp
descent
the
car
turned
to
the
right
the
road
now
wound
along
the
side
of
a
hill
bordered
by
the
seine
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
by
perpendicular
cliffs
high
in
the
grey
distance
dominating
the
countryside
rose
the
venerated
sanctuary
of
rouen
nôtre
dame
de
bon
secours
we
have
only
six
more
kilometres
to
cover
remarked
the
abbé
soon
they
were
moving
at
a
slower
pace
through
the
outskirts
of
rouen
jolted
on
the
cobbles
of
the
little
street
thrown
against
each
other
every
time
the
car
on
the
two
rails
running
along
the
middle
of
the
roadway
fandor
and
the
little
abbé
were
knocked
wide
awake
we
are
not
going
to
stop
asked
fandor
yes
we
must
recruit
ourselves
besides
i
have
to
call
at
a
certain
garage
attention
said
fandor
to
himself
the
doings
of
this
little
priest
are
likely
to
have
a
peculiar
interest
for
me
at
the
least
sign
of
danger
my
fandor
i
give
thee
two
minutes
to
cut
and
run
our
journalist
knew
rouen
well
he
knew
that
to
reach
barentin
the
car
passing
out
of
the
great
square
surrounded
by
the
new
barracks
would
follow
the
quay
traverse
the
town
from
end
to
end
pass
near
the
famous
transshipping
bridge
and
join
the
high
road
again
if
we
pull
up
at
one
of
the
garages
along
the
quays
all
will
be
well
thought
fandor
in
case
of
an
alarm
a
run
of
a
hundred
yards
or
so
would
bring
me
to
one
of
the
many
electric
tramways
i
should
board
a
tram
devil
take
them
if
they
dared
to
chase
and
catch
me
the
car
had
reached
the
bridge
which
prolongs
the
rue
jeanne
across
the
seine
they
were
now
in
the
heart
of
rouen
the
chauffeur
turned
can
i
stop
monsieur
i
need
petrol
and
water
the
priest
pointed
to
a
garage
stop
there
the
chauffeur
began
to
supply
the
wants
of
his
machine
with
the
help
of
an
apprentice
the
priest
jumped
out
and
entered
the
garage
fandor
followed
on
his
heels
saying
it
does
one
good
to
stretch
one
legs
the
abbé
seemed
in
no
wise
disturbed
he
walked
up
to
the
owner
of
the
place
tell
me
my
friend
have
you
by
chance
received
a
telegram
addressed
to
the
abbé
gendron
that
is
so
monsieur
it
will
be
for
you
yes
for
me
i
asked
that
a
message
should
be
sent
to
me
here
if
necessary
whilst
the
priest
tore
open
his
telegram
fandor
lit
a
cigarette
by
hook
or
by
crook
he
must
see
the
contents
of
this
telegram
which
his
travelling
companion
was
reading
with
frowning
brows
but
fandor
might
squint
in
the
glass
for
the
reflection
of
the
message
pass
behind
the
abbé
to
peep
over
his
shoulder
while
pretending
to
examine
the
posters
decorating
the
garage
walls
he
had
his
pains
for
his
reward
it
was
impossible
to
decipher
the
text
he
must
await
developments
when
the
car
was
ready
to
start
he
decided
to
speak
you
have
not
received
vexatious
instructions
i
hope
monsieur
not
at
all
there
is
always
something
disquieting
about
a
telegram
this
one
tells
me
nothing
i
did
not
know
already
at
least
suspected
the
only
result
is
that
instead
of
going
to
havre
we
shall
now
go
to
dieppe
why
this
change
of
destination
was
fandor
mental
query
and
what
did
this
precious
priest
suspect
the
abbé
was
giving
the
chauffeur
instructions
you
will
leave
rouen
by
the
new
route
you
will
draw
up
at
an
hotel
which
you
will
find
on
the
right
named
if
my
memory
does
not
play
me
false
flowery
a
pretty
name
remarked
fandor
a
stupid
name
replied
the
abbé
the
house
does
not
stand
at
any
and
the
place
is
as
flowerless
as
it
is
possible
to
be
there
was
a
pause
that
matters
little
however
corporal
the
quarters
are
good
the
table
sufficient
you
shall
judge
for
yourself
now
here
is
the
inn
under
the
skillful
guidance
of
the
chauffeur
the
car
turned
sharply
and
passed
under
a
little
arch
which
served
as
a
courtyard
entrance
the
car
came
to
a
in
a
great
yard
crowded
with
unharnessed
carts
stablemen
and
normandy
peasants
in
their
sunday
best
a
stout
man
came
forward
his
head
was
as
hairless
as
a
billiard
ball
this
was
the
to
every
question
put
by
the
little
abbé
he
replied
with
a
broad
grin
which
displayed
his
toothless
gums
his
voice
was
as
odd
as
his
appearance
it
was
and
quavering
you
can
give
us
dinner
why
certainly
monsieur
le
curé
you
have
a
where
the
car
can
be
put
up
with
a
comprehensive
sweep
of
his
arm
mine
host
of
flowery
indicated
the
courtyard
the
carts
of
his
regular
clients
were
left
there
in
his
charge
he
could
not
see
why
the
of
these
strangers
could
not
pass
the
night
there
also
and
you
can
reserve
three
rooms
for
us
was
the
little
abbé
final
demand
this
time
the
face
of
mine
host
lost
its
jovial
assurance
three
rooms
ah
no
monsieur
le
curé
that
is
quite
impossible
but
we
can
manage
all
the
same
i
have
an
attic
for
your
chauffeur
and
a
fine
room
for
you
and
monsieur
the
corporal
that
will
suit
you
i
think
yes
quite
well
very
well
indeed
declared
fandor
delighted
at
this
opportunity
of
keeping
his
queer
travelling
companion
under
his
eye
the
little
abbé
was
far
from
satisfied
what
you
have
not
two
rooms
for
us
he
expostulated
i
have
a
horror
of
sharing
a
room
with
anyone
whatever
i
am
not
accustomed
to
it
and
i
can
not
sleep
under
those
conditions
monsieur
le
curé
it
full
up
here
i
have
a
wedding
party
on
my
hands
well
then
is
there
no
hotel
near
by
where
i
no
monsieur
le
curé
i
am
the
only
about
here
is
it
far
to
the
parsonage
but
my
dear
abbé
protested
fandor
i
beg
of
you
to
take
the
room
i
can
sleep
anywhere
on
two
chairs
in
the
certainly
not
declared
the
little
priest
he
turned
to
the
tell
me
just
how
far
the
parsonage
is
from
here
at
least
eight
kilometres
oh
then
it
is
out
of
the
question
what
a
disagreeable
business
this
is
we
shall
pass
a
dreadful
night
the
abbé
was
greatly
put
out
no
no
i
will
leave
the
room
to
you
again
protested
fandor
do
not
talk
so
childishly
corporal
we
have
to
be
on
the
road
again
what
good
purpose
will
it
serve
if
we
allow
ourselves
to
be
and
so
fit
for
nothing
after
all
a
bad
night
will
not
last
forever
we
must
manage
to
put
up
with
the
inconvenience
fandor
nodded
acquiescence
things
were
going
as
he
wished
dinner
at
once
ordered
the
abbé
an
affable
normandy
girl
laid
their
table
in
a
small
room
a
profusion
of
black
cocks
with
scarlet
combs
decorated
the
paper
on
its
walls
the
effect
was
at
once
bewildering
and
weirdly
funereal
meanwhile
the
abbé
walked
up
and
down
in
the
courtyard
to
judge
by
his
expression
he
was
in
no
pleasant
frame
of
mind
when
he
came
to
table
fandor
noticed
that
he
forgot
to
pronounce
the
benedicite
he
was
still
more
interested
when
the
ecclesiastic
attacked
a
tasty
chicken
with
great
gusto
this
is
certainly
the
of
december
therefore
a
fast
day
according
to
the
episcopal
mandate
which
i
have
read
and
behold
my
little
priest
is
devouring
meat
the
offered
us
fish
just
now
and
i
quite
understood
why
but
it
seems
fasting
is
not
obligatory
for
this
priest
unless
this
priest
is
not
a
priest
whilst
the
abbé
was
enjoying
his
chicken
in
silence
with
eyes
fixed
on
his
plate
fandor
once
again
subjected
him
to
a
minute
examination
he
noted
his
delicate
features
his
slim
hands
his
graceful
attitudes
he
was
so
impressed
by
this
and
various
little
details
that
when
the
abbé
after
dessert
and
a
last
glass
of
cider
rose
and
proposed
that
they
should
go
up
to
their
room
for
the
night
fandor
declared
to
himself
my
head
on
a
charger
for
it
i
bet
that
little
abbé
is
a
woman
then
more
mystery
and
a
probable
husband
or
lover
who
may
come
on
the
scene
presently
fandor
my
boy
beware
of
this
baggage
not
an
eye
must
you
close
this
night
the
priest
had
had
the
famous
package
taken
upstairs
and
placed
at
the
foot
of
his
bed
fandor
and
the
abbé
wished
each
other
good
night
as
for
me
declared
fandor
unlacing
his
boots
i
can
not
keep
my
eyes
open
i
can
say
the
same
replied
his
companion
fandor
next
remark
had
malice
in
it
i
pity
you
monsieur
no
doubt
you
have
long
prayers
to
recite
especially
if
you
have
not
finished
your
breviary
you
are
mistaken
answered
the
abbé
with
a
slight
smile
i
am
dispensed
from
a
certain
number
of
religious
exercises
a
fig
for
you
my
fine
fellow
said
fandor
to
himself
the
deuce
is
in
if
i
do
not
catch
you
out
over
one
of
your
lies
the
little
abbé
was
seated
on
a
chair
attending
to
his
nails
fandor
walked
to
the
door
explaining
i
have
a
horror
of
sleeping
in
an
hotel
bedroom
with
an
unlocked
door
you
will
allow
me
to
turn
the
key
turn
it
then
locking
the
door
fandor
drew
the
key
and
threw
it
on
to
the
lap
there
monsieur
if
you
like
to
put
it
on
your
bedside
table
fandor
action
had
a
purpose
ten
to
one
you
settle
the
sex
of
a
doubtful
individual
by
such
a
test
a
man
instinctively
draws
his
knees
together
when
an
object
is
thrown
on
them
a
woman
draws
them
apart
to
make
a
wider
surface
of
the
skirt
for
the
reception
of
an
article
and
thus
prevent
its
fall
to
the
ground
fandor
was
not
surprised
to
see
the
little
priest
instinctively
act
as
would
a
woman
but
would
not
a
priest
accustomed
to
wear
a
cassock
act
as
a
woman
would
fandor
realised
that
in
this
instance
the
riddle
of
sex
was
still
unsolved
began
to
undress
the
priest
continued
to
polish
his
nails
you
are
not
going
to
bed
monsieur
yes
i
am
the
ecclesiastic
took
off
his
shoes
then
his
collar
then
he
lay
down
on
the
bed
you
will
sleep
with
all
your
clothes
on
asked
yes
when
i
have
to
sleep
in
a
bed
i
am
not
accustomed
to
should
i
blow
out
the
candle
corporal
blow
it
out
monsieur
fandor
felt
sure
the
little
priest
was
a
woman
disguised
he
dare
not
take
off
his
cassock
because
he
was
she
wishing
his
strange
companion
a
good
night
rest
fandor
snuggled
under
the
bedclothes
determined
to
keep
awake
and
alert
he
tried
to
pass
the
dark
hours
by
mentally
reciting
xxi
a
cordial
understanding
let
us
make
peace
juve
held
out
his
hand
a
firm
strong
hand
the
hand
of
a
trusty
man
let
us
make
peace
frankly
sincerely
wholeheartedly
lieutenant
de
loubersac
signed
the
pact
without
a
hesitation
he
put
his
hand
into
the
hand
of
juve
and
shook
it
warmly
agreed
monsieur
we
are
of
one
mind
on
that
point
the
two
men
stood
silent
considering
each
other
despite
the
violence
of
the
west
wind
sweeping
across
the
end
of
the
stockade
bringing
with
it
enormous
waves
rising
from
a
rough
grey
sea
the
detective
and
the
officer
were
on
the
jetty
of
dieppe
harbour
this
chill
december
afternoon
the
sea
looked
dark
and
threatening
since
their
arrival
at
dieppe
juve
and
de
loubersac
had
mutually
avoided
each
other
time
and
again
they
had
come
face
to
face
each
more
bored
more
than
the
other
this
mutual
sulky
avoidance
was
over
they
had
made
it
up
the
evening
before
following
his
arrest
under
the
guise
of
vagualame
juve
had
been
conducted
to
the
dépôt
by
his
colleagues
no
sooner
were
they
seated
in
the
taxi
under
the
charge
of
inspector
michel
and
his
companion
than
juve
made
himself
known
to
his
gratified
unsuspecting
colleagues
it
was
a
humiliating
surprise
for
the
two
policemen
they
felt
fooled
juve
realising
that
neither
michel
nor
his
colleagues
were
at
present
likely
to
lend
him
their
generous
aid
in
the
carrying
out
of
certain
plans
decided
to
keep
silence
nor
would
he
let
them
into
the
secret
of
his
discoveries
regarding
bobinette
highly
suspicious
character
and
conduct
that
she
was
an
accomplice
a
tool
of
the
real
vagualame
was
established
beyond
a
doubt
the
crestfallen
michel
had
to
unhandcuff
juve
and
restore
him
to
liberty
but
he
extracted
a
promise
from
his
amazing
colleague
that
he
would
see
monsieur
havard
next
morning
and
give
him
an
account
of
all
that
had
passed
accordingly
at
seven
next
morning
juve
was
received
by
monsieur
havard
juve
had
hoped
for
a
few
minutes
interview
then
a
rush
to
the
east
station
there
to
await
the
arrival
of
corporal
vinson
the
interview
was
a
long
one
juve
was
too
late
but
he
had
not
lost
time
at
headquarters
the
second
bureau
had
telephoned
warning
police
headquarters
that
corporal
vinson
arrived
in
paris
was
going
to
dieppe
very
shortly
where
a
foreign
would
take
possession
of
a
piece
of
artillery
stolen
and
probably
being
taken
care
of
by
the
corporal
this
information
coincided
with
what
juve
had
learned
from
bobinette
and
completed
it
he
must
start
for
dieppe
instanter
if
he
had
any
luck
he
would
arrest
the
soldier
and
bobinette
as
well
she
would
convey
the
piece
to
vinson
in
the
morning
and
would
accompany
him
to
dieppe
she
was
daring
enough
to
do
it
at
the
saint
lazare
station
juve
had
caught
the
train
for
dieppe
which
meets
the
one
boat
bound
for
england
he
had
just
settled
himself
in
a
compartment
of
which
he
was
the
solitary
occupant
when
he
recognised
an
officer
of
the
second
bureau
walking
in
the
corridor
lieutenant
henri
de
loubersac
the
train
was
barely
in
motion
when
de
loubersac
seated
himself
opposite
juve
the
recognition
had
been
mutual
a
few
hours
before
henri
de
loubersac
had
learned
of
the
extraordinary
arrest
of
the
false
vagualame
he
then
understood
that
it
was
with
juve
he
had
talked
on
the
quay
near
the
rue
de
solférino
the
officer
of
the
second
bureau
was
profoundly
mortified
he
had
been
taken
in
by
a
civilian
he
declared
it
is
the
sort
of
thing
one
does
not
do
it
is
unworthy
of
an
honourable
man
in
the
batignolles
tunnel
juve
and
he
began
discussing
this
point
de
loubersac
angry
excited
juve
immovably
calm
the
discussion
lasted
until
their
train
ran
into
dieppe
station
they
had
exhausted
the
subject
but
had
scarcely
touched
on
the
motives
of
their
journey
to
this
seaport
the
two
men
separated
with
a
stiff
salute
obviously
both
were
keeping
a
watch
on
the
approaches
to
the
quay
they
encountered
each
other
repeatedly
it
became
ridiculous
being
intelligent
men
devoted
to
their
duty
they
determined
to
act
in
concert
for
the
better
fulfillment
of
this
same
duty
duty
to
their
respective
chiefs
duty
to
the
state
duty
to
france
so
they
made
it
up
after
their
cordial
handshake
juve
wishing
to
define
the
situation
asked
now
what
are
we
after
exactly
you
and
i
what
is
the
common
aim
of
the
second
bureau
and
police
headquarters
de
loubersac
reply
was
a
document
has
been
stolen
from
us
we
want
to
find
it
juve
said
two
crimes
have
been
committed
we
wish
to
seize
the
assassin
and
continued
de
loubersac
with
a
smile
as
it
is
probable
the
murderer
of
captain
brocq
and
nichoune
is
none
other
than
the
individual
who
stole
our
by
uniting
our
efforts
finished
juve
we
have
every
chance
of
discovering
the
one
and
the
other
there
was
a
pause
then
juve
asked
nevertheless
lieutenant
since
i
find
you
here
i
fancy
there
is
some
side
development
some
incident
in
reality
have
you
not
come
to
dieppe
to
intercept
a
certain
corporal
who
is
to
deliver
to
a
foreign
power
a
piece
of
artillery
of
the
highest
importance
you
have
hit
it
was
de
loubersac
reply
i
see
you
know
about
this
gun
affair
juve
nodded
the
two
men
were
slowly
returning
towards
the
town
by
way
of
the
outer
harbour
quays
they
approached
a
dock
in
which
was
anchored
a
pretty
little
yacht
flying
the
dutch
flag
juve
stared
hard
at
this
elegant
craft
de
loubersac
enquired
if
yachting
was
his
favourite
sport
juve
smiled
far
from
it
nevertheless
when
that
yacht
weighs
anchor
it
would
be
my
delight
to
inspect
her
from
stem
to
stern
accompanied
by
the
custom
house
officials
it
is
my
conviction
that
corporal
vinson
will
soon
turn
up
slip
aboard
with
the
stolen
conceal
it
in
some
prepared
below
his
otherwise
uninteresting
person
will
be
hidden
also
i
am
of
the
same
mind
declared
de
loubersac
as
the
two
men
strolled
they
exchanged
information
de
loubersac
told
juve
that
according
to
the
latest
messages
from
the
second
bureau
vinson
had
left
paris
with
a
priest
in
a
hired
and
had
taken
the
road
to
rouen
that
in
all
probability
they
would
reach
dieppe
before
nightfall
and
when
they
arrived
it
is
precisely
at
that
moment
we
shall
arrest
them
i
have
made
all
arrangements
with
the
local
police
finished
de
loubersac
ah
murmured
juve
what
a
pity
captain
loreuil
and
inspector
michel
came
on
the
scenes
last
night
and
arrested
me
prematurely
thinking
they
had
got
the
real
vagualame
for
now
i
can
never
make
use
of
the
ruffian
disguise
to
pump
the
different
members
of
the
great
spy
organisation
we
are
on
the
track
of
but
what
prevents
you
now
from
masquerading
as
vagualame
demanded
de
loubersac
why
when
no
one
knew
i
was
a
false
vagualame
i
could
make
up
in
his
likeness
now
they
know
the
truth
not
only
is
it
known
by
the
followers
of
vagualame
by
this
time
but
i
am
certain
of
it
i
was
recognised
by
the
real
vagualame
himself
did
he
see
you
then
i
would
stake
my
life
on
it
asserted
juve
just
when
where
in
the
street
de
loubersac
was
keenly
interested
no
just
when
i
was
arrested
but
from
what
i
have
heard
there
were
very
few
of
you
cried
de
loubersac
then
the
real
vagualame
must
have
been
at
the
baron
de
naarboveck
hah
was
juve
exclamation
whom
do
you
suspect
juve
kept
silence
suddenly
he
concealed
himself
behind
a
deserted
goods
waggon
de
loubersac
did
the
same
both
fixed
examining
eyes
on
a
couple
coming
in
their
direction
they
were
not
the
expected
pair
of
traitors
who
again
asked
de
loubersac
juve
was
impenetrable
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
the
companion
mademoiselle
berthe
otherwise
bobinette
has
played
and
perhaps
still
plays
an
incomprehensible
part
in
these
affairs
you
find
it
incomprehensible
juve
burst
into
laughter
i
do
not
well
then
were
i
in
your
place
i
should
not
hesitate
to
arrest
her
and
then
oh
explanations
could
follow
juve
considered
his
companion
a
minute
then
taking
his
arm
in
friendly
fashion
continued
their
walk
along
the
quay
i
have
a
theory
said
juve
that
when
dealing
with
such
complex
affairs
as
these
we
are
now
engaged
on
affairs
in
which
the
actors
are
but
puppets
acting
on
behalf
of
the
prime
mover
a
ungetatable
or
almost
so
we
should
aim
at
first
securing
the
prime
mover
to
secure
the
puppets
and
leave
the
prime
mover
free
is
to
obtain
but
a
partial
success
the
victory
is
then
more
apparent
than
real
i
might
have
arrested
bobinette
as
we
shall
probably
arrest
corporal
vinson
before
long
but
would
her
arrest
furnish
us
with
the
master
key
to
this
problem
have
we
not
a
better
chance
of
discovering
the
powerful
head
of
this
band
if
we
allow
his
collaborators
to
perform
their
manoeuvres
in
a
fancied
security
the
prime
mover
of
these
mysteries
juve
was
convinced
that
the
prime
mover
of
these
nefarious
mysteries
the
murderous
master
mind
was
and
could
be
none
other
than
fantômas
juve
paused
abruptly
a
man
was
coming
to
meet
them
an
investigating
agent
attached
to
the
general
commissariat
department
at
dieppe
they
are
asking
for
monsieur
henri
on
the
telephone
he
announced
de
loubersac
rushed
to
the
police
station
over
the
telephone
a
war
office
colleague
informed
him
that
the
fugitive
corporal
accompanied
by
a
priest
had
during
the
last
hour
arrived
at
a
garage
in
rouen
meanwhile
juve
had
received
a
cypher
telegram
at
the
police
station
confirming
the
news
with
the
addition
that
after
replenishing
the
motor
with
petrol
they
had
set
off
again
at
once
they
had
received
a
telegram
juve
and
de
loubersac
returned
to
the
quay
our
beauties
will
not
be
so
long
now
said
he
with
twilight
the
tempest
had
died
down
night
was
falling
fast
the
waters
in
the
docks
reflected
the
light
from
the
quay
lamps
on
their
shining
heaving
surface
now
for
some
time
henri
de
loubersac
had
been
longing
to
ask
juve
a
question
longing
yet
fearing
to
voice
it
a
question
relating
to
his
personal
affairs
had
not
juve
as
vagualame
clearly
insinuated
that
wilhelmine
de
naarboveck
must
have
been
the
mistress
of
captain
brocq
had
not
de
loubersac
protested
vehemently
against
such
an
odious
calumny
but
now
that
he
knew
this
statement
was
juve
he
was
in
a
state
of
torment
his
love
was
bleeding
with
the
torture
of
it
at
last
he
summoned
up
courage
to
put
the
question
to
juve
juve
frowned
looked
embarrassed
he
had
foreseen
the
question
he
did
not
believe
that
wilhelmine
de
naarboveck
had
been
captain
mistress
but
he
knew
there
was
an
undecipherable
mystery
in
this
girl
life
and
he
had
an
intuition
that
the
discovery
of
this
secret
would
probably
throw
light
on
certain
points
which
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
had
remained
obscure
was
this
girl
really
the
baron
daughter
since
he
had
learned
that
wilhelmine
visited
lady
beltham
tomb
regularly
this
notorious
lady
beltham
mistress
of
fantômas
he
had
been
saying
to
himself
no
mademoiselle
wilhelmine
is
not
the
daughter
of
de
naarboveck
the
rich
diplomat
but
who
then
is
she
juve
knew
it
was
useless
to
say
this
to
de
loubersac
blinded
by
love
as
he
was
but
his
aim
a
rather
machiavellian
one
was
to
sow
seeds
of
suspicion
in
the
heart
of
this
lover
which
would
drive
him
to
provoke
an
explanation
and
force
wilhelmine
to
speak
out
for
she
must
surely
know
the
facts
relating
to
her
identity
this
machiavellian
juve
did
not
hesitate
to
say
to
de
loubersac
you
remember
what
the
false
vagualame
told
you
when
you
talked
with
him
on
the
banks
of
the
seine
you
are
in
the
presence
of
this
false
vagualame
of
me
juve
as
you
know
well
i
am
sorry
to
tell
you
that
whatever
outside
appearance
i
adopt
my
way
of
thinking
my
way
of
seeing
things
seldom
changes
henri
de
loubersac
understood
he
grew
pale
his
lips
were
pressed
tightly
together
he
clenched
his
fists
satisfied
with
this
result
juve
repeated
to
himself
this
celebrated
aphorism
of
the
bastille
slander
slander
some
of
it
always
sticks
it
was
dark
in
a
little
restaurant
near
by
the
two
men
dined
frugally
it
was
a
mediocre
repast
not
too
well
cooked
anxious
questionings
tormented
them
the
fugitives
were
long
in
coming
had
they
got
wind
of
what
was
afoot
had
vinson
and
the
priest
been
warned
that
detectives
were
hot
on
their
trail
if
so
it
was
all
up
with
the
arrest
de
loubersac
remained
on
the
watch
juve
returned
to
the
police
station
he
was
crossing
the
threshold
when
the
telephone
shrilled
news
from
the
police
sergeant
at
rouen
the
corporal
and
the
abbé
leaving
rouen
had
taken
the
road
to
barentin
had
dined
at
flowery
crossways
and
according
to
the
chauffeur
statement
they
would
pass
the
night
there
they
would
reach
dieppe
next
morning
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
juve
hurried
with
the
news
to
de
loubersac
after
a
short
consultation
they
separated
each
pretended
he
was
going
to
his
own
particular
hotel
to
get
some
rest
juve
did
not
quit
the
neighbourhood
of
the
quay
installed
in
a
custom
house
official
sentry
box
he
stolidly
set
himself
to
pass
the
night
with
only
his
thoughts
for
company
an
hour
passed
juve
cocked
a
listening
ear
there
were
furtive
footsteps
stealthy
movements
close
by
juve
thrilled
if
it
were
the
traitor
vinson
the
steps
came
nearer
nearer
juve
slipped
out
of
his
shelter
someone
rose
up
before
him
and
mutual
recognition
and
laughter
de
loubersac
was
on
the
watch
as
well
jovially
juve
summed
up
the
situation
lieutenant
we
can
truly
declare
that
civilian
or
soldier
in
pursuit
of
our
duty
we
are
ever
on
a
war
footing
philosophically
resigned
to
a
wakeful
night
the
pair
marched
stolidly
persistently
doggedly
up
and
down
the
dieppe
quay
up
and
down
up
and
down
an
interminable
xxii
have
they
bolted
whilst
juve
and
henri
de
loubersac
were
watching
through
the
midnight
hours
for
the
arrival
of
the
traitors
fandor
in
his
hotel
was
also
on
the
alert
he
did
not
mean
to
sleep
a
wink
the
noise
of
the
below
helped
him
in
that
the
revellers
retired
at
last
and
silence
fell
on
flowery
fandor
feigning
sleep
lay
as
still
as
a
mouse
but
how
interminable
seemed
the
hours
ah
thought
fandor
if
only
my
abbé
were
sleeping
i
should
decamp
but
that
little
bundle
of
mystery
is
wide
awake
i
can
sense
his
wakefulness
fandor
lay
listening
for
the
next
eternity
of
an
hour
to
strike
and
pass
into
limbo
at
last
dawn
began
to
break
the
window
curtains
became
transparent
a
cock
crowed
in
the
yard
below
the
voice
of
a
sounded
loud
in
the
stillness
of
early
day
you
are
awake
corporal
asked
the
priest
in
a
low
voice
quite
monsieur
you
feel
rested
i
only
dosed
off
a
little
liar
thought
fandor
he
replied
that
is
just
what
i
did
fandor
yawned
loudly
will
you
get
up
first
corporal
when
you
have
finished
dressing
i
will
start
in
that
way
we
shall
not
interfere
with
each
other
but
monsieur
i
do
not
want
to
keep
you
waiting
do
get
up
first
certainly
not
no
no
do
not
let
us
stand
on
ceremony
fandor
did
not
insist
he
was
too
pleased
with
his
request
in
next
to
no
time
with
a
kind
of
lick
and
polish
had
washed
his
face
had
dressed
was
ready
my
dear
abbé
said
he
if
you
would
like
me
to
i
will
ascertain
whether
your
chauffeur
is
up
and
will
tell
him
to
get
ready
to
start
i
was
going
to
ask
you
to
do
that
very
thing
corporal
as
the
door
closed
on
him
fandor
turned
with
an
ironic
salute
towards
the
little
priest
much
pleased
said
he
to
himself
and
with
the
hope
of
never
meeting
you
on
my
road
without
juve
on
my
heels
to
offer
you
a
pair
of
handcuffs
the
right
bracelets
for
you
and
richly
deserved
fandor
did
not
awaken
the
chauffeur
he
went
into
the
yard
there
he
encountered
the
a
brazen
lie
was
the
safe
way
he
decided
we
have
passed
a
very
good
night
declared
he
my
companions
are
getting
ready
i
am
going
to
see
if
the
car
is
in
order
for
our
start
to
himself
fandor
added
as
my
little
priest
window
looks
in
the
opposite
direction
he
can
not
see
what
i
am
up
to
fandor
was
an
expert
chauffeur
the
car
was
fully
supplied
with
petrol
and
water
was
in
admirable
order
the
was
watching
him
if
they
ask
for
me
said
tell
them
i
have
gone
for
a
test
run
and
will
be
back
in
three
minutes
with
that
he
jumped
into
his
seat
set
the
car
in
motion
passed
beneath
the
archway
and
on
to
the
high
road
he
turned
in
the
direction
of
barentin
fandor
felt
the
charm
of
this
early
drive
through
the
pastoral
lands
of
normandy
hope
rose
in
him
was
he
not
escaping
from
the
terrifying
consequences
of
his
vinson
masquerade
evidently
thought
he
i
must
definitely
abandon
the
rôle
of
soldier
the
risks
are
too
great
if
the
military
authorities
laid
me
by
the
heels
it
would
be
all
up
with
the
real
vinson
is
certainly
in
foreign
parts
by
now
and
safe
from
arrest
i
know
by
sight
the
head
spies
at
verdun
the
norbet
brothers
the
elegant
tourist
and
his
car
and
that
false
priest
i
can
continue
my
investigations
better
in
my
own
shoes
and
i
can
get
juve
to
help
me
his
thoughts
dwelt
on
the
mysterious
abbé
i
would
give
a
jolly
lot
to
know
who
this
pretended
abbé
really
is
he
tore
through
the
village
of
barentin
at
racing
speed
a
covered
cart
full
of
peasants
stopped
the
way
fandor
drew
up
he
addressed
the
driver
monsieur
i
have
rather
lost
my
bearings
will
you
kindly
tell
me
in
which
direction
the
nearest
railway
station
lies
the
driver
who
was
the
mail
carrier
for
maronne
answered
civilly
you
must
go
to
motteville
corporal
at
the
first
you
come
to
turn
to
the
right
keep
straight
on
that
will
bring
you
to
the
station
corporal
thanked
the
man
and
started
off
in
the
direction
indicated
all
i
have
to
do
now
thought
he
is
to
discover
some
nice
lonely
spot
shortly
after
this
he
sighted
a
grove
with
a
thick
undergrowth
it
bordered
the
road
fandor
rushed
his
machine
into
a
field
and
brought
it
to
a
in
the
centre
of
a
clump
of
trees
he
alighted
that
motor
is
a
good
goer
said
he
but
it
is
too
dangerous
a
companion
too
conspicuous
a
mark
as
he
thought
of
the
stranded
bundle
of
mystery
at
flowery
he
laughed
then
he
started
for
the
station
at
a
steady
pace
the
chauffeur
woke
he
saw
it
was
nine
good
lord
i
shall
catch
it
hot
we
were
to
start
at
eight
he
dressed
hastily
ran
down
to
the
yard
stared
about
him
his
car
had
vanished
was
he
still
dreaming
he
ran
round
to
the
front
of
the
hotel
no
car
was
the
car
stolen
had
they
set
off
without
him
the
was
marketing
in
rouen
the
stablemen
could
throw
no
light
on
this
mystery
probably
one
of
your
masters
has
gone
for
a
turn
suggested
a
man
the
chauffeur
anger
grew
if
they
dared
to
he
shouted
it
is
not
their
car
i
not
in
their
service
that
curé
came
to
my
garage
yesterday
and
hired
my
car
for
an
outing
what
business
has
this
curé
or
his
soldier
to
move
my
car
i
teach
them
who
and
what
i
am
the
farm
boys
stable
lads
and
men
were
shouting
with
laughter
at
the
chauffeur
fury
said
one
you
know
their
room
do
you
why
not
see
if
they
are
in
it
make
sure
you
have
cause
for
all
this
dust
up
the
chauffeur
rushed
upstairs
four
at
a
time
he
banged
on
the
door
of
the
room
taken
by
his
temporary
employer
and
the
corporal
banged
and
thumped
no
response
he
tried
the
door
unlocked
he
opened
it
looked
in
empty
cursing
and
raging
the
chauffeur
clattered
downstairs
and
collided
with
the
where
is
my
curé
shouted
the
chauffeur
your
curé
echoed
the
good
fellow
staring
yes
my
curé
or
his
corporal
where
are
they
where
i
say
where
are
they
gaped
the
the
entire
hotel
staff
was
grouped
in
the
background
laughing
it
my
car
i
ca
find
it
do
you
know
where
it
is
your
car
exclaimed
the
but
the
corporal
went
off
two
hours
ago
and
more
he
was
going
for
a
spin
was
what
he
told
me
was
the
curé
with
him
no
the
curé
left
just
after
him
saying
he
was
going
to
send
off
a
telegram
was
it
not
true
the
chauffeur
sank
on
a
chair
here
a
trick
those
dirty
thieves
have
cut
off
with
my
car
let
me
catch
them
i
give
them
beans
and
a
bit
the
hotel
was
in
an
uproar
the
wildest
suggestions
rained
on
the
distracted
chauffeur
he
pulled
himself
together
rose
called
to
the
who
was
mechanically
searching
the
yard
for
the
vanished
car
where
is
the
police
station
i
must
warn
the
police
that
priest
and
corporal
can
not
have
got
so
very
far
in
two
hours
they
did
not
leave
together
they
had
to
meet
somewhere
they
may
not
know
how
to
manage
the
car
that
means
delay
a
breakdown
perhaps
mine
host
of
flowery
was
all
the
more
ready
to
help
the
chauffeur
in
that
he
had
been
cheated
such
fugitives
would
never
pay
him
the
eighteen
francs
they
owed
him
for
bed
and
board
unless
they
were
caught
and
made
to
disgorge
i
will
come
with
you
to
the
police
station
he
announced
i
have
my
complaint
to
make
also
at
the
police
station
they
saw
the
police
sergeant
himself
the
chauffeur
had
barely
begun
his
tale
of
woe
when
the
sergeant
interrupted
with
the
smile
of
one
imparting
good
news
you
state
that
you
have
lost
a
does
it
happen
to
be
red
and
will
seat
four
persons
yes
that
it
have
you
seen
it
does
it
happen
to
have
for
number
exact
has
it
passed
this
way
wait
were
there
not
goatskin
wraps
inside
yes
yes
the
sergeant
laughed
silently
very
well
then
i
should
say
you
were
in
luck
now
i
am
going
to
tell
you
where
your
car
is
the
chauffeur
beamed
you
know
where
my
car
is
i
do
a
bare
fifteen
minutes
ago
it
was
found
in
the
open
fields
on
father
flory
land
some
seventeen
hundred
yards
from
the
motteville
station
father
flory
saw
it
when
driving
his
cattle
to
pasture
he
asked
himself
if
the
car
had
not
fallen
from
the
skies
during
the
night
the
and
chauffeur
stared
at
each
other
what
had
possessed
the
fugitives
to
steal
the
car
and
then
cast
it
away
in
the
open
fields
so
near
the
scene
of
their
theft
the
devil
was
in
it
the
had
an
idea
they
had
fled
to
avoid
paying
his
bill
the
chauffeur
cared
only
to
get
to
the
car
as
quickly
as
possible
to
assure
himself
that
it
was
his
car
and
was
not
injured
beyond
repair
after
much
haggling
it
was
arranged
that
a
little
cart
and
horse
should
take
him
to
the
desired
spot
meanwhile
the
was
to
go
about
his
duties
at
flowery
the
chauffeur
must
needs
return
and
telegraph
to
his
garage
in
paris
for
funds
he
declared
he
had
not
a
sou
on
him
finally
the
chauffeur
set
off
perched
on
a
big
white
mare
which
had
been
rejected
time
and
again
by
the
remount
department
he
took
the
road
at
a
galloping
trot
when
he
reached
father
flory
field
he
gave
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
he
recognised
his
car
it
proved
to
be
in
good
condition
whoever
had
driven
it
knew
what
he
was
about
it
was
the
corporal
decided
the
joyful
chauffeur
that
little
curé
would
be
afraid
of
spoiling
his
little
white
hands
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
peasants
who
had
hurried
from
all
the
farms
in
the
neighbourhood
to
see
the
which
had
grown
up
in
a
single
night
in
father
flory
field
the
chauffeur
set
his
car
in
motion
hard
work
the
car
had
been
driven
deep
into
the
soft
soil
at
last
he
got
to
the
road
a
very
good
evening
to
you
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
shouted
to
the
peasants
who
with
ironic
grins
and
hands
in
pockets
had
watched
him
at
work
not
one
had
come
forward
to
help
him
he
set
off
at
top
speed
for
flowery
meanwhile
the
police
sergeant
important
in
full
official
uniform
had
started
for
flowery
accompanied
by
the
this
affair
requires
looking
into
he
announced
the
law
will
have
more
than
a
word
to
say
about
it
i
must
get
further
information
and
make
notes
he
with
the
at
his
heels
mounted
to
the
little
room
where
fandor
and
the
little
priest
had
passed
the
night
the
policeman
uncovered
on
entering
what
he
considered
a
sumptuous
superbly
decorated
room
he
had
not
the
least
idea
how
to
set
about
his
investigations
in
order
to
get
the
best
results
he
seated
himself
in
an
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
do
you
know
the
name
of
these
individuals
the
thinking
of
the
eighteen
francs
he
had
lost
and
of
how
he
could
indemnify
himself
paid
scant
attention
to
the
investigations
look
here
he
cried
that
a
good
thing
in
their
haste
they
have
forgotten
to
take
this
package
there
may
be
things
of
value
in
it
i
may
be
able
to
pay
myself
out
of
them
the
policeman
rose
he
also
examined
the
package
in
the
name
of
the
law
i
shall
open
this
package
to
ascertain
exactly
what
is
in
it
the
two
men
undid
the
rope
tightly
bound
round
the
covering
but
whilst
mine
host
of
flowery
had
no
idea
of
what
the
contents
of
the
package
signified
the
sergeant
who
had
formerly
served
in
the
artillery
went
white
his
voice
was
stern
this
is
serious
very
serious
it
is
the
mouthpiece
of
a
large
gun
larger
than
any
i
have
come
across
the
recovered
drew
up
before
flowery
with
a
flourish
the
beaming
chauffeur
jumped
down
and
went
towards
the
and
the
police
sergeant
it
was
my
car
all
right
he
cried
and
i
believed
that
never
again
should
i
set
eyes
on
it
when
i
the
chauffeur
stopped
short
the
unresponsive
and
the
police
sergeant
were
staring
at
him
fixedly
not
a
word
did
they
utter
the
chauffeur
stared
in
turn
then
he
asked
well
what
is
it
are
you
frozen
you
two
what
the
matter
with
you
i
inform
you
that
i
have
found
my
motor
and
that
how
you
take
it
the
police
sergeant
answered
i
must
ask
you
to
give
us
some
highly
necessary
information
and
explanations
do
you
know
anything
about
the
priest
and
the
soldier
who
hired
your
car
and
you
there
was
a
questioning
pause
the
chauffeur
broke
it
i
have
already
told
you
that
i
do
not
know
them
if
i
did
things
would
not
have
happened
as
they
have
now
why
have
you
asked
me
that
question
the
policeman
reply
was
another
question
his
tone
was
stern
then
you
declare
you
had
no
idea
of
what
they
were
taking
with
them
in
your
car
what
they
were
taking
with
them
in
my
car
repeated
the
chauffeur
in
a
tone
of
bewildered
interrogation
the
police
sergeant
marched
up
to
him
look
here
now
it
is
incredible
that
you
do
not
know
what
is
in
that
package
you
carried
in
your
car
and
now
your
masters
have
disappeared
we
are
to
believe
that
you
know
nothing
about
that
either
and
now
you
return
what
is
the
reason
of
that
and
is
it
to
be
supposed
that
i
am
going
to
allow
you
to
make
off
again
without
asking
you
to
explain
yourself
and
this
extraordinary
situation
the
chauffeur
saw
that
the
sided
with
the
police
sergeant
there
was
no
support
to
be
got
in
that
quarter
explain
yourself
policeman
burst
out
the
chauffeur
what
all
this
humbugging
claptrap
you
are
giving
me
in
the
name
of
the
law
declared
the
offended
police
officer
in
solemn
tones
i
think
it
advisable
to
arrest
you
you
may
consider
yourself
my
prisoner
as
the
astounded
chauffeur
could
not
find
words
to
answer
this
the
sergeant
added
ah
my
fine
fellow
this
is
the
way
then
you
steal
guns
to
help
the
germans
to
shoot
the
french
it
a
mercy
i
spotted
you
but
you
are
mad
mad
mad
protested
the
chauffeur
the
police
sergeant
cut
him
short
that
is
enough
i
am
going
to
take
you
to
rouen
you
can
account
for
yourself
to
the
magistrates
xxiii
london
and
paris
juve
and
henri
de
loubersac
passed
the
night
on
the
quay
daybreak
found
them
marching
side
by
side
keeping
their
weary
watch
and
ward
de
loubersac
had
fallen
silent
monosyllabic
replies
to
juve
remarks
had
given
place
to
no
remarks
at
all
juve
looked
at
henri
and
smiled
he
has
gone
to
the
country
of
dreams
he
sleeps
standing
in
brotherly
fashion
the
policeman
guided
the
young
man
towards
the
shelter
settled
him
in
and
left
him
he
was
within
call
if
needed
meanwhile
he
could
have
his
sleep
out
filling
his
pipe
afresh
juve
resumed
his
walk
along
the
quay
he
was
uneasy
he
was
also
in
a
bad
humour
why
did
vinson
and
this
priest
tarry
on
the
way
why
should
corporal
vinson
bearer
of
this
compromising
artillery
piece
plant
himself
at
a
little
hotel
in
rouen
for
the
night
had
they
been
warned
and
stopped
juve
feared
so
evidently
these
men
are
acting
for
fantômas
said
he
to
himself
fantômas
must
be
watching
the
police
he
knows
them
but
they
do
not
know
him
suppose
he
knows
of
our
arrival
at
dieppe
suppose
the
two
traitors
being
warned
have
given
our
men
the
slip
on
the
way
suppose
this
stop
at
rouen
was
caused
by
the
telegram
they
received
at
the
garage
if
our
arrival
here
has
been
signalled
our
watch
will
be
fruitless
neither
vinson
nor
the
priest
will
show
themselves
on
this
quay
as
he
kept
his
tireless
vigil
juve
eyed
the
yacht
swinging
gently
on
the
rising
tide
could
he
find
a
pretext
which
would
take
him
aboard
justify
a
thorough
investigation
of
boat
and
crew
the
answer
to
more
than
one
tormenting
problem
might
lie
hidden
there
then
juve
recalled
his
talk
with
de
loubersac
had
he
been
happily
inspired
to
speak
so
to
him
of
the
girl
he
loved
the
enigmatic
wilhelmine
suppose
de
loubersac
instead
of
questioning
her
broke
with
her
it
would
be
abominable
of
me
to
spoil
this
child
love
affair
for
what
are
less
than
suspicions
on
my
part
only
the
vaguest
hypothesis
juve
smoked
and
ruminated
as
he
paced
the
lonely
quay
i
need
not
worry
concluded
he
at
last
granting
that
we
shall
clear
up
all
these
mysteries
wilhelmine
innocence
her
candour
will
be
made
manifest
that
being
so
henri
de
loubersac
will
be
the
first
to
acknowledge
it
the
first
to
beg
her
forgiveness
quarrels
are
not
serious
quarrels
so
juve
continued
his
tireless
promenade
sailors
seeking
their
swung
past
him
in
the
growing
light
of
day
juve
looked
at
his
watch
i
told
them
to
put
on
a
special
for
the
night
and
they
have
instructions
to
send
me
any
telegrams
still
it
is
six
i
will
see
if
there
is
anything
fresh
juve
found
de
loubersac
fast
asleep
in
the
sentry
box
and
shook
him
by
the
shoulder
lieutenant
lieutenant
he
shouted
wake
up
i
want
you
to
keep
watch
while
i
run
to
headquarters
here
there
may
be
news
de
loubersac
jumped
up
wide
awake
in
a
moment
he
took
his
turn
on
the
quay
at
once
juve
hurried
to
the
police
station
he
was
on
the
doorstep
when
a
telegraph
boy
rode
up
with
a
telegram
it
was
for
our
detective
the
paper
shook
in
juve
hands
as
his
eyes
devoured
the
message
it
was
in
cypher
corporal
vinson
taken
refuge
in
london
recognised
and
identified
by
me
this
morning
at
four
when
leaving
victoria
station
i
followed
him
and
know
where
he
is
what
to
be
done
next
awaiting
your
orders
juve
wondered
whether
he
was
on
his
head
or
his
heels
vinson
in
london
left
victoria
station
this
morning
what
did
it
mean
the
wire
is
precise
in
its
details
the
man
who
sends
it
is
a
sharp
police
spy
never
hesitates
never
makes
a
blunder
it
seems
evident
that
vinson
has
given
us
the
slip
he
must
have
reached
the
coast
at
some
point
and
in
an
unnoticed
boat
has
passed
under
our
noses
this
very
night
here
a
go
the
very
deuce
of
a
go
intensely
irritated
excited
juve
read
and
reread
the
telegram
fussed
and
fumed
about
the
police
station
under
the
scared
eyes
of
the
policeman
on
guard
duty
that
worthy
began
to
think
the
detective
from
paris
was
an
unmitigated
nuisance
juve
did
not
take
this
humble
colleague
into
his
confidence
he
issued
orders
you
must
not
stir
from
here
till
the
superintendent
arrives
you
will
hand
him
this
telegram
addressed
to
me
here
i
will
wire
instructions
in
the
morning
where
they
are
to
be
forwarded
to
me
in
england
in
england
yes
i
am
crossing
immediately
by
a
cook
excursion
steamer
which
goes
in
an
hour
unless
i
am
mistaken
juve
found
de
loubersac
pacing
the
quay
he
had
been
smoking
cigar
after
cigar
to
clear
his
head
juve
handed
him
a
sheet
of
paper
on
it
he
had
copied
the
text
of
the
telegram
read
that
he
cried
these
confounded
spies
have
found
means
to
escape
our
attentions
but
this
is
not
the
end
of
the
game
lieutenant
henri
was
thunderstruck
what
are
you
going
to
do
juve
reach
london
with
all
speed
will
you
come
lieutenant
de
loubersac
considered
no
he
decided
in
the
first
place
i
have
no
right
to
leave
the
country
unless
authorised
to
do
so
i
am
not
free
to
act
according
to
my
own
good
will
and
pleasure
besides
i
have
an
idea
there
is
work
for
me
in
paris
to
watch
that
little
intriguer
bobinette
will
be
an
interesting
task
from
what
you
told
me
yesterday
she
is
up
to
the
neck
in
those
villainous
plots
and
plans
while
you
investigate
in
london
paris
shall
be
my
field
of
operations
you
approve
of
this
juve
i
think
you
are
right
juve
accompanied
the
lieutenant
to
the
station
de
loubersac
was
in
a
hurry
to
be
off
he
would
not
wait
for
the
noon
express
he
took
the
slow
train
as
it
began
to
move
he
and
juve
exchanged
a
cordial
handshake
good
luck
cried
he
thanks
lieutenant
good
courage
the
latter
admonition
was
given
with
a
purpose
for
juve
was
under
no
illusion
as
to
de
loubersac
feelings
at
any
other
time
thought
he
de
loubersac
would
have
seen
it
to
be
his
duty
to
accompany
me
to
london
he
could
have
secured
an
authorisation
from
his
headquarters
if
required
besides
attached
to
the
second
bureau
as
he
is
no
doubt
the
ordinary
military
rules
and
regulations
would
hardly
apply
to
him
to
a
large
extent
he
must
be
allowed
a
free
hand
in
emergencies
this
is
an
emergency
an
important
one
no
he
wishes
to
see
wilhelmine
he
is
in
love
is
worried
suspicious
he
wishes
to
clear
up
the
mystery
surrounding
identity
he
is
determined
to
know
what
exactly
were
her
relations
with
captain
brocq
also
he
wants
to
find
out
all
there
is
to
find
regarding
bobinette
and
her
doings
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
these
dark
mysteries
unravel
the
tangled
threads
needs
a
clear
head
and
a
brave
heart
for
his
feelings
are
deeply
involved
and
they
may
yet
be
cut
to
the
quick
he
is
a
straight
goer
that
young
man
was
juve
concluding
thought
he
will
do
his
duty
and
when
one
does
one
duty
with
rare
exceptions
the
result
is
happiness
whilst
juve
returned
to
the
jetty
to
await
the
departure
of
the
excursion
steamer
henri
de
loubersac
alone
in
his
compartment
reflected
sadly
on
his
relations
with
wilhelmine
he
had
loved
her
a
long
time
a
frank
a
sincere
affection
for
her
had
gradually
grown
into
a
love
which
filled
his
whole
heart
and
mind
juve
words
had
troubled
him
profoundly
this
spy
chase
had
been
a
momentary
distraction
but
now
his
anxieties
his
suspicions
his
fears
swarmed
and
buzzed
among
his
thoughts
he
could
not
banish
them
his
reflections
so
absorbed
him
that
he
lost
consciousness
of
time
and
place
when
the
train
came
to
a
in
rouen
station
he
could
have
vowed
they
had
left
dieppe
but
a
few
miles
behind
he
would
stretch
his
limbs
on
the
platform
he
jumped
out
but
as
he
strolled
past
the
kiosks
gazing
at
the
papers
and
magazines
exhibited
in
them
his
mind
was
haunted
but
by
one
vision
wilhelmine
the
train
was
about
to
leave
the
porters
were
shouting
he
hastened
to
his
compartment
his
foot
was
on
the
mounting
board
it
might
have
been
nailed
there
for
the
moment
a
young
woman
was
seated
in
the
further
corner
she
had
lowered
her
window
and
with
head
out
was
either
saying
to
someone
or
was
watching
the
comings
and
goings
of
the
station
her
attitude
the
lines
of
her
figure
were
familiar
to
de
loubersac
he
felt
sure
he
knew
her
he
took
his
seat
and
awaited
the
turning
of
her
head
a
piercing
whistle
and
the
train
began
to
move
the
young
woman
drew
back
pulled
up
the
window
and
sat
back
in
her
seat
henri
de
loubersac
saw
her
she
made
a
movement
of
surprise
you
monsieur
henri
you
mademoiselle
bobinette
by
what
chance
began
de
loubersac
bobinette
interrupted
it
is
rather
i
who
might
ask
you
that
monsieur
henri
as
for
me
i
have
been
spending
four
days
with
my
family
at
rouen
i
asked
for
a
holiday
and
monsieur
de
naarboveck
very
kindly
granted
it
but
you
de
loubersac
was
nervously
chewing
the
end
of
his
blonde
moustache
with
a
shrug
he
replied
oh
i
it
is
never
surprising
to
meet
me
in
a
train
i
am
constantly
on
the
move
here
there
everywhere
you
have
news
of
mademoiselle
wilhelmine
excellent
news
you
are
coming
to
monsieur
de
naarboveck
soon
i
think
of
calling
on
the
baron
this
evening
talk
continued
commonplace
desultory
what
questions
crowded
to
his
lips
sternly
repressed
she
lies
thought
he
while
listening
to
the
details
of
her
family
visit
she
certainly
lies
i
must
pretend
to
be
her
dupe
the
miserable
creature
his
whole
soul
revolted
at
the
thought
that
this
bobinette
involved
as
she
must
be
in
disgraceful
adventures
abominable
tragedies
shared
wilhelmine
home
was
her
friend
he
was
seized
by
a
mad
desire
to
grip
bobinette
by
the
throat
silence
her
lying
tongue
arrest
handcuff
her
on
the
spot
render
her
powerless
he
had
noticed
a
vague
line
of
black
showing
below
her
light
coloured
taffeta
skirt
it
might
be
the
frill
of
a
petticoat
just
too
long
thinking
no
more
of
it
he
continued
to
chat
of
indifferent
things
presently
a
quick
movement
of
bobinette
raised
her
skirt
a
little
more
this
time
the
watchful
de
loubersac
could
not
be
mistaken
he
had
seen
clearly
that
what
showed
beneath
bobinette
skirt
every
now
and
again
was
a
priest
cassock
bobinette
dress
concealed
the
disguise
of
a
priest
too
well
he
understood
the
part
this
perverse
creature
had
been
playing
now
he
could
account
for
their
meeting
in
this
train
coming
from
rouen
she
had
recently
associated
with
corporal
vinson
as
a
priest
she
had
seen
him
off
no
doubt
and
anxious
to
rid
herself
of
her
ecclesiastical
exterior
as
quickly
as
might
be
she
had
slipped
on
a
dress
over
her
ecclesiastical
garment
what
was
all
this
but
a
painful
confirmation
of
juve
words
how
could
wilhelmine
be
entirely
ignorant
of
this
dreadful
character
how
could
wilhelmine
be
wholly
innocent
of
the
terribly
compromising
actions
of
her
daily
companion
did
wilhelmine
lack
intuition
was
she
without
that
delicate
sensitiveness
which
is
the
birthright
of
all
nice
women
how
could
a
pure
girl
breathe
the
miasmic
atmosphere
which
must
emanate
from
the
soul
of
this
abominable
woman
it
was
terrible
the
desultory
commonplace
chat
went
on
whilst
de
loubersac
was
considering
how
best
to
act
arrest
bobinette
yes
he
must
not
dare
not
hesitate
it
was
his
duty
if
he
held
this
young
woman
at
his
mercy
it
was
perhaps
the
only
way
painful
as
it
was
to
ultimately
clear
up
the
position
of
wilhelmine
how
proceed
whilst
still
chattering
of
this
and
that
henri
de
loubersac
made
up
his
mind
being
a
soldier
and
not
a
policeman
i
can
not
myself
arrest
this
woman
the
scandal
would
be
tremendous
i
should
get
into
the
hottest
of
hot
water
with
my
chiefs
it
is
not
my
job
directly
we
arrive
at
the
saint
lazare
station
i
will
manage
to
signal
one
of
the
plain
clothes
men
always
on
the
watch
there
two
of
them
will
have
her
fast
before
she
knows
where
she
is
this
seemed
the
easier
because
bobinette
had
a
heavy
valise
with
her
she
would
have
to
call
a
porter
and
give
him
instructions
this
would
give
him
time
to
act
reassured
henri
de
loubersac
continued
to
laugh
and
joke
though
it
went
sorely
against
the
grain
at
last
saint
lazare
station
the
train
stopped
i
will
say
mademoiselle
bobinette
i
must
hurry
away
you
will
excuse
me
de
loubersac
leaped
on
to
the
platform
jostling
the
passengers
crowding
his
path
he
must
reach
the
platform
exit
without
a
delay
as
he
handed
his
ticket
to
the
collecter
a
hubbub
arose
passengers
were
stopping
turning
back
running
something
sensational
must
have
happened
he
paused
he
heard
a
porter
at
his
elbow
say
in
a
low
voice
do
stop
monsieur
henri
you
may
be
noticed
de
loubersac
identified
the
speaker
as
a
man
in
the
employ
of
the
second
bureau
he
handed
his
wraps
to
this
detective
dressed
as
an
ordinary
porter
what
is
happening
then
he
asked
an
arrest
ordered
by
the
second
bureau
there
was
a
man
or
a
woman
in
your
train
ah
bobinette
must
have
been
identified
at
rouen
when
she
got
into
the
train
juve
men
must
have
wired
from
there
henri
de
loubersac
rejoiced
how
he
hated
this
creature
whose
detestable
influence
must
harm
wilhelmine
whose
wickedness
might
work
woe
to
the
girl
he
loved
this
traitorous
wretch
would
be
under
lock
and
key
now
splendid
with
mind
relieved
he
thanked
the
informer
and
prepared
to
leave
the
station
but
as
he
descended
the
steps
leading
to
the
cour
du
havre
he
stopped
two
police
detectives
whom
he
knew
well
were
walking
on
either
side
a
soldier
in
corporal
uniform
vinson
of
course
they
must
be
taking
him
to
the
cherche
midi
prison
de
loubersac
realised
what
had
happened
the
telegram
juve
had
received
at
dieppe
must
have
been
false
vinson
and
bobinette
discovering
that
they
were
under
observation
had
found
means
to
send
juve
a
telegram
announcing
that
vinson
had
been
met
in
london
having
thus
drawn
juve
over
to
england
they
had
returned
to
paris
the
traitors
must
have
separated
this
would
lessen
their
chances
of
being
recognised
they
must
have
arrested
vinson
as
he
was
leaving
the
train
bobinette
become
unrecognisable
when
her
cassock
was
hidden
must
have
escaped
de
loubersac
ran
back
he
hunted
the
station
all
over
he
jumped
into
a
taxi
and
drove
up
and
down
all
the
adjoining
streets
but
the
chase
was
a
useless
one
bobinette
was
invisible
bobinette
had
seized
her
opportunity
she
had
disappeared
xxiv
an
appetiser
at
robert
bar
have
another
whisky
old
sport
not
i
we
have
taken
too
much
on
board
as
it
is
you
must
you
must
seen
through
the
gold
of
old
scotch
life
seems
more
beautiful
and
the
barmaids
more
fetching
perched
on
the
high
stools
which
allowed
them
to
lean
on
the
rail
of
the
bar
the
two
topers
solemnly
clinked
glasses
the
younger
of
the
two
a
lean
dark
fellow
emptied
his
glass
at
one
go
but
his
companion
a
big
fair
man
about
clean
shaven
and
slightly
bald
handled
his
glass
so
awkwardly
that
the
contents
escaped
on
to
the
floor
the
big
fair
man
called
for
fresh
drinks
their
glasses
were
refilled
so
quickly
that
the
dark
young
man
failed
to
notice
it
he
drank
on
and
on
automatically
as
though
wound
up
to
do
so
but
his
companion
barely
wetted
his
lips
with
the
intoxicating
liquor
it
was
six
and
a
dismal
december
evening
but
there
was
an
animated
cosmopolitan
crowd
in
robert
bar
robert
of
london
is
the
equivalent
of
maxim
of
paris
the
great
place
for
luxurious
entertainments
it
opens
its
doors
at
twilight
and
does
not
close
them
till
the
small
hours
are
well
advanced
when
evening
falls
the
scene
grows
animated
business
men
and
women
of
pleasure
crowd
the
rooms
gradually
the
crowd
assumes
a
cosmopolitan
character
a
band
of
hungarian
gipsies
plays
inspiriting
and
seductive
music
the
crush
increases
the
noise
grows
louder
and
amidst
this
babel
of
voices
the
racket
the
din
the
barmaids
ply
their
trade
with
calm
determination
they
flirt
with
their
customers
and
egg
them
on
to
drink
glass
after
glass
of
wine
and
spirits
for
the
good
of
the
house
in
an
atmosphere
thick
with
tobacco
smoke
every
ten
minutes
or
so
a
newspaper
boy
slips
in
with
the
latest
evening
editions
to
be
chased
out
by
one
of
the
managers
of
mixed
nationality
who
for
the
most
part
talk
in
a
strangely
mixed
tongue
partly
french
partly
english
in
this
noisy
crowded
place
the
two
drinkers
were
talking
together
familiarly
the
dark
young
man
after
having
listened
with
curiosity
to
the
confidences
of
his
companion
which
must
have
been
of
an
extraordinary
nature
judging
by
the
exclamations
of
surprise
they
evoked
asked
but
what
is
your
profession
then
but
i
have
already
told
you
replied
the
fat
man
i
am
a
clown
a
musical
clown
i
interpret
comic
romances
i
dress
up
as
a
negro
i
play
the
banjo
this
jovial
individual
began
humming
an
air
which
was
the
rage
of
the
moment
the
dark
young
man
interrupted
with
another
question
what
is
your
native
country
tommy
oh
i
am
a
belgian
and
you
butler
the
dark
young
man
who
answered
to
the
name
of
butler
gave
what
had
to
pass
for
an
account
of
himself
i
i
canadian
just
come
from
canada
hardly
three
months
ago
as
much
as
that
remarked
fat
tommy
butler
seemed
upset
by
this
question
yes
yes
and
i
feel
very
anxious
because
i
do
know
my
way
about
and
i
do
know
english
very
well
and
i
ca
find
work
try
as
i
will
it
seems
no
what
can
you
do
a
little
of
everything
that
is
to
say
nothing
butler
said
slowly
i
can
do
the
clown
burst
out
laughing
that
will
not
take
you
far
there
are
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
at
that
job
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
then
asked
butler
his
plump
acquaintance
put
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
there
is
only
one
career
in
the
world
the
theatre
there
is
only
one
profession
worth
following
that
of
artiste
see
how
i
have
succeeded
and
without
having
received
the
least
instruction
for
my
parents
never
cared
a
hang
for
my
future
i
soon
earned
plenty
money
now
though
still
in
the
full
flush
of
young
i
am
on
the
point
of
making
a
fortune
the
clown
evidently
fancied
himself
for
he
was
of
a
ripe
age
no
chicken
his
companion
gazed
at
him
admiringly
certainly
the
clown
looked
wealthy
his
thick
was
gold
english
sovereigns
ostentatiously
displayed
were
stuffed
in
a
bulging
purse
his
appearance
justified
his
boasts
i
would
ask
nothing
better
than
to
get
into
a
theatre
said
butler
with
a
simple
air
but
i
do
know
how
to
do
anything
the
clown
shot
a
shrewd
glance
at
his
companion
butler
face
was
flushed
his
eyes
were
wandering
his
wits
seemed
dulled
the
glasses
of
whisky
were
having
their
effect
tommy
murmured
into
butler
ear
i
have
known
you
but
a
short
time
but
we
are
in
sympathy
and
already
i
feel
a
very
great
friendship
for
you
tell
me
is
it
the
same
on
your
side
touched
by
this
cordiality
butler
raised
a
shaky
hand
above
his
glass
and
declared
i
swear
it
good
my
dear
butler
i
think
things
will
arrange
themselves
marvellously
well
just
fancy
when
walking
on
the
thames
embankment
i
met
a
theatrical
manager
whom
i
have
known
this
long
while
a
very
good
fellow
called
paul
naturally
we
had
a
glass
together
then
i
asked
him
what
he
was
doing
his
answer
was
am
looking
for
an
artiste
of
course
i
suggested
myself
paul
explained
that
he
did
not
need
a
clown
but
a
professor
i
promised
to
find
him
one
if
i
could
would
you
like
to
be
this
professor
professor
of
what
questioned
butler
who
in
spite
of
his
growing
intoxication
was
lending
an
attentive
ear
to
clown
tommy
who
laughed
at
the
question
you
would
never
guess
who
would
be
your
pupils
you
would
have
to
teach
japanese
canaries
to
sing
butler
considered
this
a
joke
in
the
worst
of
taste
the
clown
declared
there
was
nothing
ridiculous
about
teaching
japanese
canaries
to
sing
the
important
point
was
that
the
professor
of
singing
japanese
canary
birds
would
receive
immediate
payment
whilst
butler
was
turning
over
this
offer
in
his
muddled
mind
for
he
had
persuaded
himself
that
the
offer
was
a
genuine
one
the
clown
fidgeted
on
his
high
stool
and
hummed
an
air
from
in
a
falsetto
voice
the
clown
stopped
come
butler
is
it
settled
butler
hesitated
i
am
not
sure
that
i
had
better
but
yes
certainly
you
had
better
insisted
the
clown
and
as
it
happens
i
have
agreed
to
dine
with
this
manager
he
must
be
in
the
room
downstairs
i
will
go
and
look
for
him
we
three
could
meet
and
talk
the
thing
over
where
should
i
have
to
go
asked
butler
to
what
country
to
belgium
of
course
replied
tommy
the
manager
is
a
belgian
like
myself
we
are
compatriots
the
clown
judging
that
his
companion
had
decided
to
accept
the
offer
left
him
saying
i
am
going
to
find
the
manager
and
tell
him
my
friend
butler
will
be
his
professor
of
japanese
singing
canaries
butler
sighed
then
swallowed
another
glass
of
whisky
pushing
his
way
among
the
crowded
tables
of
the
front
downstairs
room
the
clown
reached
the
end
of
the
room
he
approached
a
man
seated
before
a
full
glass
it
was
untouched
monsieur
juve
asked
tommy
in
a
low
voice
juve
nodded
captain
loreuil
that
is
so
at
present
tommy
musical
belgian
clown
and
you
are
monsieur
paul
theatrical
manager
that
is
according
to
our
arrangement
is
it
not
quite
so
anything
fresh
loreuil
smiled
i
have
got
your
man
sure
of
it
loreuil
seated
himself
next
juve
he
spoke
low
he
calls
himself
butler
says
he
is
canadian
he
declares
he
has
been
in
london
some
time
it
is
a
falsehood
i
recognise
him
perfectly
i
had
already
seen
him
at
châlons
when
he
had
a
connection
with
the
singer
nichoune
and
we
suspected
him
of
being
the
author
of
the
leakages
in
the
offices
of
the
headquarters
staff
that
is
corporal
vinson
then
consequently
you
must
intervene
said
loreuil
juve
reflected
after
a
short
silence
he
said
intervene
you
go
too
fast
remember
we
are
in
a
foreign
country
and
there
is
no
question
of
a
common
law
crime
vinson
is
not
accused
of
murder
simply
of
treason
i
like
that
word
remarked
loreuil
ironically
do
take
that
in
bad
part
smiled
juve
but
it
has
its
importance
from
an
international
point
of
view
i
can
not
arrest
vinson
in
england
on
the
pretext
that
he
is
a
spy
happily
we
have
foreseen
that
difficulty
said
loreuil
butler
will
accompany
us
to
belgium
he
believes
we
are
belgians
belgium
means
france
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
the
three
of
us
juve
had
reached
london
the
evening
before
he
had
found
at
scotland
yard
several
telegrams
and
a
private
note
from
a
detective
friend
informing
him
of
the
arrival
of
an
individual
known
to
be
an
officer
of
the
second
bureau
juve
met
loreuil
the
two
men
on
the
same
quest
put
their
heads
together
they
were
soon
on
the
track
of
vinson
a
man
answering
to
his
description
had
been
in
london
several
weeks
this
was
the
truth
juve
would
not
admit
it
he
believed
vinson
had
arrived
in
england
only
a
few
hours
ahead
of
him
loreuil
whose
mission
did
not
include
the
arrest
of
vinson
considered
he
had
done
his
part
as
soon
as
he
had
identified
the
corporal
juve
would
do
the
rest
we
are
agreed
then
said
loreuil
if
i
introduce
you
to
butler
as
paul
the
theatrical
manager
who
wishes
to
engage
him
as
trainer
of
canaries
the
rest
you
can
manage
for
yourself
be
circumspect
the
fellow
is
on
the
lookout
he
must
leave
with
me
it
is
urgent
insisted
juve
you
must
help
me
captain
captain
loreuil
frowned
i
must
confess
i
do
like
this
sort
of
thing
said
he
but
this
affair
is
more
serious
even
than
you
know
said
juve
this
vinson
business
does
not
stand
alone
it
is
but
a
strand
in
a
vast
network
of
mystery
and
wickedness
of
the
most
malignant
kind
still
the
captain
was
reluctant
to
take
part
in
such
a
sinister
comedy
to
make
a
poor
wretch
tipsy
in
order
to
deliver
him
to
the
authorities
for
punishment
wounded
the
captain
juve
overcame
his
hesitations
with
the
words
it
is
not
merely
a
secret
service
matter
monsieur
it
is
a
question
of
national
defence
i
will
help
you
monsieur
was
the
captain
answer
to
this
adding
let
us
go
up
our
man
patience
must
be
giving
out
xxv
the
arrest
the
dover
express
the
continental
mail
was
moving
out
of
charing
cross
station
three
travellers
were
seated
in
a
compartment
they
were
smoking
big
cigars
their
eyes
were
bright
their
cheeks
flushed
they
looked
like
big
men
who
had
dined
well
these
were
butler
tommy
and
paul
leaving
for
belgium
otherwise
juve
loreuil
and
vinson
bound
for
france
copious
libations
of
generous
wines
and
strong
liqueurs
had
reduced
to
the
condition
of
a
maudlin
puppet
tommy
and
paul
had
made
butler
most
conveniently
drunk
the
train
rushed
forward
through
station
after
station
brilliantly
lighted
then
plunged
into
the
obscurity
of
the
country
a
stupefying
warmth
from
the
heating
apparatus
impelled
slumber
unfortunate
lulled
by
the
regular
movement
of
the
train
was
soon
fast
asleep
juve
and
loreuil
kept
vigil
they
were
sitting
side
by
side
facing
their
captive
dover
will
be
the
difficulty
whispered
juve
who
had
drawn
closer
to
the
captain
yes
that
is
the
crucial
point
agreed
loreuil
the
express
was
entering
the
tunnels
pierced
in
the
precipitous
coastline
of
the
channel
near
dover
there
was
a
short
stop
at
dover
town
station
before
it
drew
up
on
the
pier
there
the
travellers
would
embark
of
these
there
were
two
distant
streams
those
crossing
to
belgium
those
bound
for
france
still
slept
soundly
juve
was
waiting
till
the
last
minute
then
he
would
awaken
his
prisoner
as
he
already
considered
him
and
shepherd
him
aboard
the
calais
boat
captain
loreuil
got
out
and
went
on
ahead
come
along
butler
juve
cried
suddenly
he
shook
the
slumbering
traitor
sharply
leaped
to
his
feet
with
frightened
eyes
and
gaping
mouth
what
is
it
he
stuttered
what
do
you
want
with
me
juve
smile
was
a
masterpiece
of
hypocrisy
why
old
fellow
you
must
wake
up
we
must
go
aboard
our
boat
the
corporal
heard
men
shouting
steamer
for
ostend
steamer
for
calais
we
must
hurry
cried
juve
pushing
the
bemused
out
of
the
compartment
there
was
a
sea
fog
growing
denser
every
minute
without
their
powerful
electric
lights
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
recognise
the
boats
or
the
gangways
leading
to
them
juve
had
butler
by
the
arm
a
necessary
precaution
for
the
wretched
man
could
scarcely
keep
on
his
feet
juve
propelled
him
towards
a
gangway
a
minute
later
both
were
on
the
boat
vinson
caught
sight
of
the
inscription
on
the
lifebuoys
a
flash
of
reason
illumined
mind
he
hesitated
drew
back
with
a
frightened
look
did
i
hear
just
now
that
this
boat
goes
to
calais
a
passing
sailor
heard
this
question
he
was
about
to
enlighten
but
juve
pushed
him
aside
this
imbecile
was
going
to
spoil
everything
no
old
fellow
you
are
quite
mistaken
it
is
the
that
goes
to
calais
we
go
to
ostend
with
the
accepted
this
statement
as
true
an
whistle
sounded
the
cables
were
drawn
up
a
vibratory
motion
told
the
passengers
they
were
off
the
light
was
extinguished
the
silently
made
its
way
out
to
sea
there
was
a
dense
fog
in
the
channel
the
sounded
its
lugubrious
note
the
sea
was
rough
a
strong
wind
from
the
had
been
blowing
all
the
afternoon
the
boat
began
to
pitch
and
toss
the
passengers
were
drenched
though
nothing
of
a
sailor
in
the
nautical
sense
juve
took
his
duckings
with
equanimity
a
bit
of
a
pitch
and
toss
would
keep
vinson
occupied
the
fog
was
juve
friend
it
lent
an
air
of
vagueness
of
confusion
to
surroundings
the
vagaries
of
the
steamer
would
further
distract
what
thoughts
he
was
capable
of
still
they
were
on
an
english
boat
and
should
the
corporal
grasp
what
was
happening
and
refuse
to
disembark
juve
would
be
in
a
fix
must
be
kept
in
ignorance
of
the
truth
till
they
were
on
french
soil
captain
loreuil
had
remained
at
dover
declaring
he
still
had
much
to
do
in
england
besides
he
could
not
be
brought
to
consider
that
to
arrest
criminals
came
within
the
scope
of
his
duties
to
mark
them
down
point
them
out
yes
thus
he
had
tracked
down
the
traitor
and
left
him
in
good
hands
meanwhile
was
suffering
from
a
severe
attack
of
his
head
seemed
splitting
with
throbbing
pain
how
long
shall
we
be
getting
across
he
asked
in
a
faint
voice
three
hours
said
juve
this
was
the
crossing
time
between
dover
and
ostend
heavy
were
running
those
who
braved
the
buffetings
and
drenchings
above
deck
were
now
few
it
was
a
villainous
crossing
at
the
end
of
an
hour
and
a
half
the
odious
waltz
of
the
steamer
slowed
down
the
was
silent
the
moved
alongside
the
jetties
of
calais
the
gangways
were
let
down
porters
invaded
the
deck
carrying
away
luggage
to
the
trains
awaiting
the
travellers
in
the
terminus
station
now
for
it
thought
juve
once
on
french
soil
it
was
all
up
with
the
liberty
of
corporal
vinson
his
arrest
would
be
immediate
juve
considered
the
miserable
heap
collapsed
on
a
side
bench
this
traitorous
rag
of
humanity
had
once
been
an
upright
man
a
true
soldier
of
france
it
was
terrible
it
was
piteous
juve
raised
the
wretched
fellow
could
hardly
stand
up
juve
signed
to
a
sailor
who
took
the
corporal
left
arm
while
juve
supported
him
on
the
right
vinson
disembarked
he
set
his
feet
on
the
soil
the
sacred
soil
of
france
the
crowd
was
pouring
into
the
great
hall
where
customs
officers
were
examining
the
small
baggage
juve
drew
to
the
left
the
traitor
must
not
catch
sight
of
the
french
uniforms
an
individual
seemed
to
rise
out
of
the
ground
in
front
of
them
juve
said
to
him
in
a
low
voice
our
man
revived
by
a
cordial
vinson
gradually
recovered
his
senses
painfully
he
raised
his
heavy
eyelids
he
looked
about
him
curiously
anxiously
he
was
in
a
large
square
room
dimly
lighted
almost
empty
with
bare
white
walls
where
am
i
he
asked
juve
three
men
surrounded
him
juve
was
the
sole
face
he
knew
juve
wore
a
solemn
look
his
words
were
gently
spoken
you
are
at
calais
in
the
special
police
quarters
connected
with
the
station
corporal
vinson
i
am
sorry
to
have
to
tell
you
that
you
are
under
arrest
my
god
exclaimed
the
traitor
he
attempted
to
rise
but
fell
back
on
his
seat
his
eyes
were
staring
at
the
handcuffs
on
his
wrists
he
burst
into
tears
juve
felt
pity
for
this
miserable
being
huddled
up
there
in
the
depths
of
humiliation
and
terror
but
the
dreadful
fact
remained
vinson
was
a
criminal
a
traitor
perhaps
his
errors
were
due
to
a
bad
to
deplorable
examples
alas
juve
was
not
there
to
pass
judgment
but
to
deliver
the
guilty
wretch
into
the
hands
of
the
authorities
come
now
he
said
tapping
vinson
on
the
shoulder
come
we
are
leaving
for
paris
corporal
vinson
traitor
raised
supplicating
eyes
to
juve
then
realising
all
resistance
was
vain
he
rose
painfully
he
assumed
an
air
of
indifference
a
policeman
from
headquarters
had
joined
juve
the
three
men
got
into
an
empty
compartment
in
a
voice
quivering
with
shame
vinson
begged
juve
not
to
allow
anyone
to
enter
i
should
be
so
ashamed
he
muttered
with
hanging
head
and
hunched
shoulders
we
shall
do
our
best
to
prevent
it
juve
assured
him
after
an
explanation
with
the
the
compartment
was
labelled
the
train
started
vinson
was
wide
awake
now
and
dejected
to
the
last
degree
after
a
existence
but
still
a
free
one
in
england
he
had
allowed
himself
to
be
nabbed
by
the
police
like
the
veriest
simpleton
the
papers
would
be
full
of
it
vinson
who
had
been
led
into
criminal
ways
by
his
love
for
a
bad
woman
troubled
himself
much
less
regarding
the
punishment
to
be
meted
out
to
him
than
about
the
dreadful
distress
his
arrest
would
cause
his
mother
the
old
alsatian
mother
when
she
learned
that
her
son
was
in
prison
charged
with
treason
to
france
would
die
of
grief
vinson
wished
with
all
his
heart
that
he
had
stuck
to
his
first
decision
that
he
had
killed
himself
rather
than
make
confession
to
the
journalist
jérôme
fandor
who
had
wished
to
save
him
and
had
helped
him
to
escape
but
who
had
really
done
him
a
bad
service
since
deserter
as
he
was
he
had
been
caught
like
the
most
vulgar
of
criminals
the
train
stopped
at
a
station
i
am
dying
of
thirst
mumbled
vinson
juve
sent
his
second
in
command
for
a
bottle
of
water
from
the
refreshment
buffet
vinson
thanked
juve
with
a
grateful
nod
refreshed
vinson
pulled
his
wits
together
juve
noticing
this
began
questioning
him
promising
to
treat
him
as
well
as
he
possibly
could
if
he
would
speak
out
in
confidence
assuring
him
of
the
leniency
of
the
judges
if
he
consented
to
denounce
his
accomplices
when
vinson
realised
that
he
was
to
stand
his
trial
for
spying
for
betraying
his
country
as
well
as
for
desertion
he
was
only
too
glad
to
obey
juve
suggestion
ah
murmured
he
while
tears
rolled
down
his
cheeks
cursed
be
the
day
when
i
first
agreed
to
enter
into
relations
with
the
band
of
criminals
who
have
made
of
me
what
i
am
vinson
gave
juve
a
full
account
of
his
temptation
his
errors
nevertheless
he
did
not
tell
the
detective
of
his
relations
with
jérôme
fandor
had
he
not
promised
absolute
secrecy
traitor
and
spy
as
he
was
vinson
had
given
his
word
of
honour
and
this
journalist
had
been
kind
to
him
in
return
had
given
him
a
chance
to
escape
and
start
afresh
not
for
anything
in
the
world
would
he
have
betrayed
his
oath
juve
was
a
hundred
leagues
from
suspecting
the
substitution
which
had
taken
place
between
vinson
and
fandor
he
was
convinced
he
had
corporal
vinson
before
his
eyes
but
he
also
thought
he
had
his
grip
on
the
individual
who
had
left
paris
the
night
before
accompanied
by
an
ecclesiastic
for
the
purpose
of
handing
over
to
a
foreign
power
a
most
important
piece
of
a
gun
stolen
from
the
arsenal
as
well
as
the
descriptive
plan
that
went
with
it
but
when
he
vinson
on
this
point
the
corporal
did
not
in
the
least
understand
what
he
was
driving
at
juve
who
had
been
congratulating
himself
on
his
prisoner
frankness
grew
angry
with
what
he
believed
was
a
culpable
reservation
why
did
the
corporal
who
up
to
this
had
spoken
so
freely
now
feign
ignorance
of
the
gun
piece
affair
well
he
would
find
out
his
prisoner
reasons
presently
not
wishing
to
scare
him
juve
changed
the
subject
he
had
any
number
of
questions
to
ask
the
culprit
did
he
not
know
vagualame
the
real
vagualame
vinson
told
him
many
things
about
the
old
accordion
player
with
the
patriarchal
white
beard
which
he
already
knew
but
one
remark
particularly
impressed
him
if
only
the
police
knew
all
that
goes
on
in
the
house
in
the
rue
monge
vinson
stopped
short
this
remark
opened
new
horizons
to
juve
when
they
arrived
at
the
north
station
some
hours
later
and
juve
had
transferred
his
prisoner
to
a
cab
giving
the
driver
the
address
of
the
prison
our
detective
had
learned
that
was
in
the
habit
of
visiting
a
mysterious
house
in
rue
monge
here
he
met
many
of
his
accomplices
it
was
here
the
band
of
spies
and
traitors
of
which
he
seemed
chief
disguised
themselves
issuing
forth
to
ply
their
nefarious
trade
and
mock
the
police
juve
made
a
compact
with
himself
as
soon
as
i
have
handed
my
corporal
over
to
the
military
jailors
i
know
where
i
shall
go

wilhelmine
secret
you
are
alone
wilhelmine
mademoiselle
de
naarboveck
had
just
left
the
house
in
the
rue
fabert
it
was
three
in
the
afternoon
and
she
was
going
shopping
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
she
came
on
henri
de
loubersac
it
was
a
delightful
surprise
she
had
not
seen
him
for
several
days
she
was
aware
of
the
difficult
and
dangerous
nature
of
her
future
fiancé
duties
that
they
frequently
took
him
from
paris
for
days
at
a
time
that
they
forbade
him
writing
even
a
post
card
to
let
her
know
where
he
was
now
she
felt
delightedly
sure
that
he
had
taken
advantage
of
his
first
free
moment
to
pay
her
a
visit
how
charming
of
him
the
truth
was
that
de
loubersac
whose
anxieties
and
suspicions
had
increased
hour
by
hour
till
he
was
suffering
the
tortures
of
the
damned
had
made
up
his
mind
to
have
a
decisive
talk
with
wilhelmine
a
clear
and
final
explanation
he
would
have
cost
what
it
might
full
of
joy
at
the
meeting
wilhelmine
did
not
seem
to
notice
his
anxious
looks
his
strained
expression
she
answered
his
question
with
a
welcoming
smile
i
am
alone
your
father
went
away
this
morning
the
calls
of
diplomacy
are
numerous
and
frequently
sudden
you
know
and
mademoiselle
berthe
wilhelmine
raised
her
beautiful
bright
eyes
and
met
her
questioning
glance
no
news
of
her
for
several
days
berthe
seems
to
have
disappeared
her
tone
was
grave
de
loubersac
did
not
speak
mechanically
he
fitted
his
step
to
wilhelmine
presently
he
asked
where
do
you
think
of
going
i
was
going
to
do
a
little
shopping
nothing
much
there
is
no
sort
of
hurry
she
felt
that
henri
wished
to
discuss
something
important
with
her
hers
was
too
direct
a
nature
to
put
him
off
with
flimsy
excuses
when
he
desired
a
serious
talk
should
we
walk
on
a
little
talking
as
we
go
she
suggested
with
a
charming
smile
to
walk
and
talk
with
henri
was
such
a
pleasure
de
loubersac
agreed
the
young
couple
crossed
the
esplanade
des
invalides
and
by
way
of
the
rue
the
boulevard
and
rue
buonaparte
reached
the
luxembourg
gardens
here
they
could
talk
at
ease
a
few
casual
remarks
and
henri
de
loubersac
came
to
his
point
dear
wilhelmine
there
is
a
series
of
mysteries
in
your
life
which
i
can
not
help
thinking
about
mysteries
which
trouble
me
greatly
forgive
me
for
speaking
to
you
so
frankly
you
know
how
sincere
my
feeling
for
you
is
my
love
for
you
is
strong
and
deep
my
one
desire
in
life
is
to
join
my
fate
my
existence
to
yours
but
before
that
there
are
some
things
we
must
speak
of
together
serious
things
perhaps
about
which
we
must
have
a
clear
understanding
wilhelmine
had
grown
strangely
pale
despite
the
protestations
of
love
in
which
her
future
fiancé
had
wrapped
his
questions
she
was
greatly
troubled
the
painful
moment
she
had
waited
for
had
come
she
must
tell
henri
de
loubersac
the
secret
of
her
life
no
very
grave
secret
if
considered
by
itself
but
the
consequences
of
it
and
the
innumerable
deductions
that
could
be
drawn
from
it
might
react
unfavourably
on
their
relations
to
each
other
wilhelmine
must
speak
out
they
were
just
outside
the
church
of
some
large
drops
of
rain
fell
let
us
go
into
the
church
said
wilhelmine
it
will
be
quiet
there
if
what
i
have
to
say
to
you
is
said
in
that
holy
place
you
will
feel
that
i
am
speaking
the
truth
it
is
almost
a
confession
the
poor
girl
voice
trembled
slightly
as
she
uttered
these
decisive
words
words
that
frightened
de
loubersac
what
shocking
revelations
did
they
foreshadow
he
acquiesced
the
lovers
entered
the
porch
as
he
stepped
aside
to
let
wilhelmine
pass
he
noticed
a
cab
with
drawn
blinds
which
had
that
minute
drawn
up
not
far
from
the
space
in
front
of
the
church
he
examined
it
anxiously
it
seemed
to
me
we
were
being
followed
shadowed
replied
de
loubersac
it
is
of
little
importance
however
we
must
expect
that
in
our
service
yes
you
also
have
secrets
remarked
wilhelmine
they
are
only
professional
ones
there
is
nothing
about
my
personality
to
hide
my
life
is
an
open
book
for
all
the
world
to
read
de
loubersac
tone
was
hard
it
hurt
wilhelmine
for
some
while
they
had
been
seated
behind
a
pillar
in
the
shadow
wilhelmine
had
been
speaking
henri
had
been
listening
she
told
him
she
was
not
the
daughter
of
the

her
real

was

explained
that
her
childhood

with

grandmother
the

this
tragedy

she
was

six
dreary

months
followed
then
the
baron
the
only
person
in
the
whole
world
who
seemed
to
care
whether
she
lived
or
died
came
to
find
her
he
took
her
to
paris
there
he
decided
to
pass
her
off
as
his
daughter
declaring
he
had
very
grave
reasons
for
doing
so
though
making
her
the
centre
of
a
mystery
for
undeclared
reasons
of
his
own
de
naarboveck
was
very
good
to
her
helped
her
to
unravel
her
financial
affairs
and
informed
her
that
she
was
the
owner
of
a
large
fortune
he
told
her
that
some
day
she
would
have
to
go
to
a
foreign
country
to
take
possession
of
this
fortune
the
baron
did
not
say
where
wilhelmine
stopped
her
narrative
jumped
up
pointing
to
a
shadow
moving
across
an
altar
did
you
see
she
questioned
anxiously
i
think
i
did
answered
henri
de
loubersac
it
is
the
shadow
of
some
thrown
into
relief
on
the
light
background
oh
i
hope
we
are
not
being
spied
on
of
whom
are
you
afraid
asked
de
loubersac
wilhelmine
or
thérèse
auvernois
as
she
had
confessed
herself
to
be
glanced
about
her
there
was
not
a
soul
within
hearing
now
she
would
speak
her
mind
to
henri
her
dear
henri
and
tell
him
all
you
want
to
know
dear
one
why
my
existence
has
been
surrounded
with
so
many
mysterious
precautions
of
late
years
you
wish
to
know
why
the
baron
is
so
determined
that
my
real
identity
should
remain
hidden
you
are
right
for
i
have
long
asked
myself
the
same
question
when
i
spoke
to
the
baron
about
this
for
the
first
time
it
was
only
a
few
weeks
ago
and
told
him
that
i
wished
to
appear
as
what
i
really
am
thérèse
auvernois
my
father
by
adoption
i
may
call
him
that
seeing
how
good
how
kind
he
has
been
to
me
began
by
telling
me
it
was
impossible
that
the
most
terrible
misfortunes
would
result
from
such
a
revelation
i
insisted
i
wanted
to
know
what
these
dreadful
misfortunes
would
be
and
why
they
would
follow
as
a
matter
of
course
were
it
made
known
that
i
am
thérèse
auvernois
thereupon
the
baron
told
me
astonishing
things
according
to
him
from
the
time
of
my
poor
grandmother
death
i
and
those
near
to
me
all
those
about
me
were
pursued
not
only
by
a
terrible
fatality
but
also
by
a
being
who
for
unknown
motives
wished
to
sow
perpetual
death
and
terror
among
those
intimately
connected
with
us
the
baron
did
not
want
to
talk
of
all
this
but
i
made
him
speak
out
bit
by
bit
i
learned
the
details
of
one
of
those
tragedies
which
touched
my
life
when
a
child
i
went
to
the
national
library
secretly
and
looked
through
the
newspapers
of
that
period
i
noticed
that
in
whatever
concerned
us
whether
legally
or
privately
closely
or
distantly
one
name
appeared
and
reappeared
a
terrifying
and
legendary
name
the
name
of
a
being
we
think
of
but
dare
not
mention
the
name
of
fantômas
henri
de
loubersac
was
staggered
this
statement
of
the
girl
he
knew
as
wilhelmine
de
naarboveck
far
from
impressing
him
favourably
seemed
to
him
an
improbable
story
invented
every
bit
of
it
for
the
sole
purpose
of
putting
him
on
the
wrong
track
he
had
learned
to
love
this
charming
girl
believing
her
to
be
sincere
honest
pure
brought
up
as
a
young
girl
should
be
amidst
elegant
and
distinguished
surroundings
now
behold
an
abyss
opened
before
his
eyes
separating
him
from
one
whom
he
was
now
inclined
to
consider
an
adventuress
he
remembered
juve
words
granting
the
truth
of
her
statement
that
a
tragedy
had
shadowed
her
young
life
and
altered
her
existence
this
did
not
prevent
her
from
having
been
seduced
by
captain
brocq
rather
her
early
experiences
would
tend
to
break
down
the
barriers
behind
which
nice
girls
lived
and
moved
there
were
things
that
called
for
an
explanation
for
instance
how
explain
the
intimacy
existing
between
de
naarboveck
his
daughter
and
this
mademoiselle
berthe
whose
part
in
the
affair
engaging
de
loubersac
attention
was
open
to
the
gravest
suspicions
wilhelmine
continued
what
she
called
her
confession
thinking
aloud
opening
her
heart
confiding
in
her
dear
henri
whose
silence
she
took
for
sympathy
and
encouragement
fantômas
she
murmured
i
can
not
tell
you
how
often
i
have
thought
over
this
maddening
this
puzzling
personality
terrifying
beyond
words
who
seems
implacably
bent
on
our
destruction
again
and
again
i
have
had
reason
to
fear
that
his
influence
has
been
directed
against
my
humble
self
as
if
he
guessed
something
of
this
the
baron
has
frequently
sought
to
reassure
me
yet
through
some
singular
coincidence
each
time
we
have
spoken
of
fantômas
a
tragedy
has
occurred
a
dreadful
tragedy
which
has
reminded
us
of
monstrous
crimes
committed
by
him
in
the
past
wilhelmine
statements
were
impressing
de
loubersac
less
and
less
favourably
play
acting
and
clumsy
play
acting
at
that
decided
henri
done
to
avert
my
suspicions
imagined
to
feed
my
curiosity
she
thinks
herself
a
capable
player
at
the
game
she
does
not
know
the
person
she
is
playing
with
de
loubersac
came
to
a
decision
he
rose
stood
close
to
wilhelmine
who
also
rose
instinctively
looked
her
straight
in
the
face
and
asked
wilhelmine
de
naarboveck
or
thérèse
auvernois
it
matters
little
to
me
i
wish
to
know
the
real
truth
confess
then
that
you
were
captain
brocq
mistress
monsieur
exclaimed
the
startled
girl
she
met
de
inquisitorial
look
proudly
his
penetrating
stare
did
not
falter
suddenly
wilhelmine
lips
began
to
tremble
she
grew
deadly
pale
she
might
have
been
on
the
verge
of
a
fainting
fit
she
had
realised
the
incredulity
of
the
man
to
whom
in
her
chaste
innocence
she
had
given
her
heart
in
the
pure
soul
of
this
loving
girl
an
immense
void
made
itself
felt
it
was
as
though
a
flashlight
had
revealed
to
her
the
lamentable
truth
that
the
strange
position
in
which
destiny
had
placed
her
a
position
strange
but
not
infamous
had
made
of
her
a
being
apart
had
put
her
outside
the
ordinary
life
of
humanity
outside
the
law
of
love
a
desire
to
explain
to
convince
to
justify
herself
the
desire
of
a
desperate
creature
at
bay
burned
up
in
her
like
a
flame
it
flashed
and
died
henri
had
no
confidence
in
her
he
believed
this
odious
thing
of
her
this
abominable
incredible
thing
her
heart
was
full
to
bursting
with
an
agony
of
grief
of
outraged
innocence
she
looked
him
straight
in
the
eyes
her
own
flashing
fury
you
insult
me
she
cried
withdraw
what
you
have
just
said
you
will
apologise
de
loubersac
said
in
a
low
distinct
voice
i
maintain
my
accusation
mademoiselle
until
you
have
furnished
me
with
absolute
undeniable
proofs
de
loubersac
voice
failed
him
wilhelmine
had
turned
from
him
she
hurried
to
the
door
descended
the
church
steps
and
threw
herself
into
a
passing
cab
de
loubersac
had
followed
her
in
tones
of
contempt
she
had
flung
at
him
the
words
farewell
monsieur
and
for
ever
henri
answer
was
a
shrug
of
the
shoulder
as
he
stood
there
an
outline
a
shadow
appeared
under
the
church
porch
a
something
a
being
indescribable
appeared
disappeared
running
with
swiftness
vanishing
henri
de
loubersac
had
a
clear
conviction
that
during
his
conversation
with
her
who
might
have
been
his
fiancée
in
days
to
come
they
had
been
shadowed
spied
upon
xxvii
the
two
vinsons
there
were
strange
happenings
elsewhere
on
the
day
henri
de
loubersac
and
wilhelmine
de
naarboveck
had
parted
in
grief
and
anger
it
was
on
the
stroke
of
noon
when
corporal
vinson
heard
a
key
turn
in
the
lock
of
his
cell
two
military
jailors
confronted
him
butler
the
traitor
answered
to
that
name
juve
for
reasons
of
his
own
had
not
revealed
the
prisoner
true
quality
vinson
had
therefore
been
entered
in
the
jail
book
as
butler
one
of
the
jailors
an
old
veteran
whose
uniform
was
a
mixture
of
the
civil
and
the
military
took
the
word
butler
you
are
to
be
transferred
to
a
building
belonging
to
the
council
of
war
there
you
will
occupy
cell
our
prison
here
is
for
the
condemned
only
so
you
can
not
remain
you
belong
to
the
accused
section
all
that
mattered
to
for
the
moment
was
he
had
to
reach
his
new
quarters
by
crossing
the
rue
between
two
jailors
he
would
be
exposed
to
the
curious
glances
of
the
public
he
shuddered
at
the
thought
and
there
was
worse
to
come
this
was
but
the
commencement
of
his
purgatory
as
he
had
not
known
how
to
die
at
the
right
moment
he
must
arm
himself
with
courage
to
expiate
his
cowardice
he
must
leave
the
shelter
of
his
cell
with
an
intense
effort
of
will
he
stretched
out
his
arms
was
handcuffed
without
a
murmur
and
marching
between
his
two
jailors
he
quitted
the
prison
the
bright
light
of
noonday
made
him
blink
on
reaching
the
pavement
he
recoiled
with
a
convulsive
movement
the
jailors
pulled
him
forward
it
was
the
crowded
hour
when
men
leave
offices
and
shops
for
a
midday
meal
but
the
public
of
these
parts
accustomed
to
such
comings
and
goings
of
prisoners
and
their
jailors
paid
no
attention
to
this
pitiful
trio
the
prisoner
seemed
so
overcome
with
emotion
that
after
uttering
a
long
sigh
like
a
death
rattle
he
sank
a
dead
weight
into
the
arms
of
his
jailors
they
were
forced
to
support
him
they
carried
him
to
the
courtyard
of
the
council
of
war
some
whose
curiosity
was
aroused
by
the
unusual
pallor
of
the
prisoner
wished
to
follow
but
the
jailors
closed
the
great
doors
of
the
courtyard
before
leading
him
to
his
cell
they
dumped
their
inanimate
prisoner
on
a
chair
in
the
porter
lodge
the
porter
brought
vinegar
they
rubbed
temples
with
it
a
jailor
slapped
his
hands
in
vain
the
prisoner
showed
no
signs
of
life
you
had
better
take
him
to
his
cell
advised
the
porter
perhaps
he
will
come
to
his
senses
if
laid
on
his
palliasse
in
any
case
run
for
the
medical
officer
the
jailors
who
could
make
nothing
of
their
prisoner
mysterious
condition
transported
him
to
cell
they
laid
him
on
his
palliasse
lieutenant
servin
commandant
will
you
help
me
to
reduce
these
papers
to
order

want
to
go
to
breakfast
the
lieutenant
brought
a
pile
of
documents
to
his
superior
table
and
rapidly
classified
them
his
superior
commandant
dumoulin
had
been
chief
assistant
at
the
second
bureau
he
had
passed
long
years
at
his
post
there
previous
to
that
he
had
acted
as
government
commissioner
on
the
councils
of
war
in
the
various
garrisons
where
he
had
been
stationed
some
six
months
ago
dumoulin
had
sent
in
his
request
to
the
minister
of
war
for
a
change
of
billet
his
record
being
an
excellent
one
the
minister
had
appointed
him
government
attached
to
the
principal
council
of
war
sitting
in
paris
dumoulin
had
recently
taken
up
his
new
duties
and
was
counting
on
getting
peacefully
into
the
run
of
things
when
the
evening
before
he
had
been
warned
at
his
own
home
by
a
private
note
from
the
minister
that
a
deserter
accused
of
treason
had
been
arrested
and
that
corporal
vinson
was
the
man
in
question
at
the
sight
of
this
name
commandant
dumoulin
thrilled
with
excitement
as
former
at
the
second
bureau
he
had
the
affair
at
his
finger
ends
and
well
knew
how
tangled
how
obscure
it
was
how
bristling
with
dangers
how
rich
in
complications
the
vinson
affair
it
was
the
captain
brocq
affair
the
singer
nichoune
affair
the
story
of
a
plan
of
mobilisation
stolen
of
a
gun
piece
lifted
from
the
arsenal
he
was
in
for
a
big
affair
a
sensational
case
the
commandant
passed
a
wakeful
night
and
arrived
early
at
his
office
he
must
get
to
work
fortunately
among
his
deputies
he
had
found
a
competent
and
zealous
helper
in
lieutenant
servin
he
turned
to
him
now
our
next
proceeding
will
be
to
establish
the
identity
of
corporal
vinson
we
must
examine
him
on
that
point
without
delay
send
for
him
immediately

according
to
the
prison
register

occupies
cell
excuse
me
commandant

be
in
the
council

the
commandant
adjusted

closely
at
a
yellow
paper
and
corrected

his
turn

an
error
in
cell

an
individual
named
butler
yes
commandant
butler

a
mistake

arrested
yesterday
at
the
saint
lazare
station
he
was
brought
here
and
was
registered
for
cell
besides
i

the
lieutenant

hid
himself
under
the
name
of

early
this
morning
at
the
calais
station
when
he
landed
from
england
the
arrest
was
effected
by
inspector
juve
who
took
his
prisoner
to
about
six
and
this
vinson
occupied
cell
come
now
lieutenant
you
have
lost
your
head
grumbled
the
commandant
since
vinson
was
arrested
yesterday
at
the
saint
lazare
station

is
evident
that
he
was
not
arrested
last
night
at
calais
vinson
and
butler
that
makes
two
i
beg
your
pardon
commandant
that
makes
only
one
the
commandant
looked
severely
at
his
subordinate
that
is
enough
lieutenant
send
for
corporal
vinson
who
occupied
cell
right
commandant
some
minutes
later
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
two
warders
with
a
prisoner
stood
on
the
threshold
the
commandant
assured
himself
with
a
glance
that
the
officer
acting
as
reporter
was
at
his
post
and
that
lieutenant
servin
was
seated
at
the
desk
next
his
own
enter
he
commanded
dumoulin
solemnly
opened
the
voluminous
bundle
of
papers
set
before
him
looked
through
the
documents
affecting
not
to
see
the
prisoner
stationed
before
him
ready
at
length
to
begin
the
interrogation
the
commandant
raised
his
head
straightened
himself
and
ordered
approach
the
prisoner
a
warder
on
each
side
of
him
took
a
step
forward
you
are
truly
corporal
vinson
no
commandant
dumoulin
was
silent
a
moment
choking
with
anger
his
hand
trembling
slightly
did
the
fellow
mean
to
mock
him
he
frowned
he
did
not
like
the
manner
of
this
fellow
with
his
bright
piercing
eyes
his
scornful
looks
he
repeated
are
you
corporal
vinson
no
commandant
dumoulin
was
boiling
with
rage
he
was
about
to
explode
lieutenant
servin
approached
in
a
low
voice
he
said
commandant
someone
wishes
you
to
see
him
immediately
servin
handed
his
superior
a
card
on
it
the
commandant
read
juve
detective
force
police
what
does
he
want
he
is

exclaimed
the
exasperated
dumoulin
he

the
right
moment
let
him
come
in
juve
entered
and
saluted
dumoulin
with
an
amiable
smile
he
did
not
take
any
notice
of
the
prisoner
who
was
standing
with
his
back
to
the
light
it
is
i
commandant
who
arrested
corporal
vinson
consequently
i
have
come
to
place
myself
at
your
disposal

have
done
the
right
thing
cried
dumoulin
now
will
you
get
this
prisoner
to
own
up

him
tell
us
whether
or
no
he
is
corporal
vinson
dumoulin
pointed
an
irate
finger
at
the
prisoner
our
detective
stood
rooted
to
the
ground
the
prisoner
moved
quickly
towards
him
fandor
juve
what
does
this
mean
fandor
it
means
juve
that
i
am
arrested
in
the
place
of
corporal
vinson
nothing
of
the
sort
i
arrive
from
london
i
arrested
vinson
yesterday
evening
at
calais
fandor
laughed
he
could
have
roared
with
laughter
my
dear
juve
said
he
i
should
have
to
talk
to
you
for
two
mortal
hours
before
you
would
understand
a
word
of
this
business
fandor
turned
to
the
thunderstruck
dumoulin
and
said
in
a
voice
of
the
most
exquisite
politeness
commandant
i
must
state
once
for
all
that
i
am
not
corporal
vinson
i
am
a
journalist
whom
you
perhaps
know
by
name
jérôme
fandor
on
the
staff
of
if
you
see
me
in
this
uniform
this
disguise
that
relates
to
a
series
of
events
details
of
which
i
will
give
you
with
pleasure
as
soon
as
i
have
reduced
my
own
ideas
to
order
as
things
stand
i
am
fortunate
in
meeting
my
friend
juve
who
if
you
desire
it
will
confirm
the
truth
of
my
statement
dumoulin
more
and
more
nonplussed
started
in
turn
at
the
detective
at
the
journalist
at
his
reporter
with
face
red
as
a
boiled
lobster
he
turned
to
lieutenant
servin
when
this
farcical
scene
began
servin
had
gone
into
his
own
office
and
had
given
his
secretary
an
order
the
secretary
had
just
returned
the
lieutenant
having
recorded
the
answer
brought
him
had
just
that
moment
returned
to
the
commandant
office
lieutenant
servin
looked
upset
commandant
he
gasped
out
he
turned
to
our
detective
monsieur
juve
he
continued
staring
first
at
one
man
then
at
the
other
an
incredible
thing
has
happened
i
have
just
heard
of
it
i
had
given
the
order
to
have
corporal
vinson
brought
here
immediately
the
real
corporal
vinson
he
whom
monsieur
juve
arrested
under
the
name
of
butler
well
commandant
it
appears
that
on
entering
his
cell
they
found
him
dead
what
is
that
you
say
asked
dumoulin
and
juve
together
i
say
that
he
is
dead
repeated
the
lieutenant
but
how
questioned
juve
the
lieutenant
made
a
sign
to
the
sergeant
in
charge
go
for
the
medical
officer
some
minutes
passed
in
a
silence
that
hummed
with
questions
a
young
assistant
surgeon
appeared
kindly
explain
what
is
wrong
monsieur
commanded
dumoulin
the
surgeon
spoke
my
commandant
sent
for
me
about
an
hour
ago
i
was
to
attend
to
a
prisoner
who
had
fainted
this
man
when
crossing
the
rue
du
had
suddenly
lost
consciousness
his
warders
could
not
revive
him
they
carried
him
to
his
cell
they
laid
him
on
his
palliasse
when
i
arrived
the
man
was
dead
dead
of
what
demanded
dumoulin
a
bullet
in
his
heart
replied
the
surgeon
i
ascertained
this
when
undressing
him
the
bullet
will
be
found
at
the
it
has
probably
lodged
in
the
vertebral
column
dumoulin
rose
paced
the
floor
he
was
greatly
agitated
oh
come
come
he
cried
people
are
not
killed
like
that
in
the
open
street
it
is
unheard
of
unbelievable
a
bullet
presupposes
a
revolver
a
weapon
of
percussion
of
some
description
a
detonation
there
is
a
noise
a
sound
dumoulin
went
up
to
the
young
surgeon
there
was
a
note
of
suspicious
contempt
in
his
question
are
you
quite
sure
of
what
you
say
i
am
quite
sure
commandant
during
this
discussion
juve
had
approached
fandor
when
the
surgeon
made
his
statement
juve
murmured
in
fandor
ear
vinson
shot
through
the
heart
by
a
bullet
like
captain
brocq
killed
undoubtedly
by
a
noiseless
weapon
when
crossing
the
street
here
again
is
fantômas
things
calmed
down
somewhat
fandor
addressed
dumoulin
excuse
me
commandant
for
having
troubled
you
i
should
be
most
grateful
if
you
would
set
me
at
liberty
one
tragedy
follows
hard
on
another
it
is
phenomenal
i
shall
have
commandant
dumoulin
burst
out
by
heaven
he
shouted
thumping
the
table
with
his
fist
you
are
the
limit
the
limit
you
flout
me
you
practise
on
my
credulity
now
you
would
steal
a
march
on
me
try
it
on
will
you
ah
you
are
not
corporal
vinson
no
you
are
a
journalist
you
have
got
to
prove
that
even
if
you
do
prove
it
you
have
got
yourself
into
a
pretty
pickle
by
your
fooling
by
making
a
of
the
entire
army
in
your
own
preposterous
person
by
assuming
that
uniform
guards
shouted
dumoulin
take
this
man
back
to
his
cell
be
sharp
about
it
double
his
guard
fandor
was
not
allowed
time
to
protest
he
was
marched
off
at
the
double
juve
tried
to
get
in
a
word
of
explanation
i
assure
you
commandant

jérôme

yelled
the
commandant

me
in
peace
ca

the
table
with
a
formidable
fist
at
the
risk
of
upsetting
a
pile
of
saucers
which
at
this
advanced
hour
of
the
evening
showed
clearly
how
he
had
spent

hours

of
indescribable
mixtures
specially
recommended
to
his
clients
the
guest
of

geoffrey
became
absorbed
in
the

of
strange

so
an
individual
was
this

he

been

the
more
aristocratic
title
of

legs
stretched
out
he
stared
at
the
ceiling
the
atmosphere
of
this
den
in
the
rue
monge
was
poisonous
with
the
odours
of
stale
wine
and
rank
tobacco
the
musty
air
was
thick
the
shop
was
by
one
jet
of
gas
in
the
centre
of
the
room
well
old
scrub
said
geoffrey
at
last
you
have
seen
me
because
you
have
you
remember
i
passed
the
markets
test
and
was
nominated
market
porter
jolly
well
i
do
we
had
a
famous
drinking
bout
that
time
that
so
scrub
and
my
sister
bobinette
paid
the
piper
you
remember
i
was
rejected
well
i
got
into
the
markets
all
the
same
then
one
fine
day
i
gave
a
tallykeeper
a
regular
you
did
just
did
i
i
gave
him
such
a
oner
just
like
this
lifting
his
enormous
hairy
fist
hogshead
geoffrey
brought
it
down
on
the
table
with
disastrous
results
the
ancient
board
was
split
from
end
to
end
flattering
remarks
were
showered
on
this
colossus
from
all
sides
ho
ho
nothing
can
resist
me
shouted
hogshead
geoffrey
give
me
anything
you
choose
every
table
in
the
room
no
matter
what
i
break
it
in
two
man
or
woman
wood
or
stone
it
all
one
to
me
true
or
not
hogshead
geoffrey
when
not
too
much
in
liquor
was
a
gentle
soul
a
simple
kind
creature
liable
to
sudden
gusts
of
anger
he
was
equally
capable
of
knocking
the
life
out
of
a
comrade
with
his
gigantic
fist
or
of
comforting
some
sniveling
street
urchin
crossing
his
path
well
did
the
scrub
know
it
he
too
was
a
contradictory
mixture
this
mean
little
human
specimen
had
been
newsboy
seller
of
post
cards
opener
of
cab
doors
jack
of
any
little
trade
the
companion
of
pickpockets
and
other
gentry
also
adored
the
good
manners
of
bygone
vestry
days
the
polished
phrases
the
benedictory
gestures
when
in
hospital
chance
had
given
him
hogshead
geoffrey
for
it
did
not
take
him
long
to
realise
that
he
would
be
the
gainer
by
a
friendship
with
this
kindly
giant
it
would
be
a
partnership
of
brain
and
muscle
the
scrub
commanded
geoffrey
executed
when
the
admiration
for
his
prowess
had
died
down
hogshead
geoffrey
continued
his
story
when
i
had
given
the
chief
the
the
next
day
they
gave
me
the
order
of
the
boot
if
you
would
believe
me
i
was
properly
down
and
out
i
had
saved
a
sou
was
in
debt
right
and
left
to
the
was
all
but
run
in
what
did
you
do
enquired
the
scrub
bobinette
helped
me
your
sister
oh
she
a
sharp
one
she
studied
too
she
did
the
bandages
at
lariboise
she
had
the
sous
i
told
her
my
troubles
she
let
me
have
the
dibs
so
i
could
hang
on
until
you
got
a
billet
at
big
no
bobine
said
gold
little
brother
it
all
i
have
do
come
for
more
you
must
find
a
way
out
of
the
mess
and
you
did
how
hogshead
geoffrey
hesitated
he
sipped
his
absinthe
oh
well
i
found
a
way
how
i
ask
i
tell
you
i
managed
all
right
and
then
i
got
my
job
at
big
where
you
are
now
where
i
am
you
paid
back
your
sister
hogshead
geoffrey
roared
with
laughter
i
paid
her
back
so
little
that
i
did
know
what
had
become
of
her
she
had
turned
her
back
on
lariboise
without
leaving
an
address
thought
she
must
have
kicked
the
bucket
i
would
have
been
sorry
for
that
she
a
good
sort
but
yesterday
i
had
word
from
her
bobinette
asked
me
to
meet
you
told
her
to
come
here
sure
and
how
did
she
know
your
address
hogshead
geoffrey
scratched
his
big
head
lordy
i
do
know
probably
she
saw
my
name
quoted
the
other
day
in
the
among
the
conquerors
in
the
who
strongest
competition
she
wrote
putting
the
number
of
my
old
shanty
rue
de
la
harpe
no
good
being
astonished
at
what
she
does
i
tell
you
she
has
education
she
has
it
was
half
an
hour
after
midnight
the
owner
of
crying
shouted
in
a
stentorian
voice
now
boys
it
only
seven
sous
drinks
now
it
was
the
accustomed
warning
taken
as
a
matter
of
course
protesting
in
a
squeaky
voice
that
his
constitution
was
weakly
that
his
doctor
had
ordered
him
not
to
sit
up
late
the
scrub
who
feared
a
meeting
with
bobinette
knowing
she
had
little
liking
for
him
now
took
himself
off
geoffrey
ordered
two
drinks
he
was
bored
bobinette
was
behind
her
promised
time
he
would
have
left
but
bobinette
would
pay
for
his
drinks
a
nice
little
total
at
last
she
appeared
an
bobinette
and
somewhat
flustered
she
was
quietly
dressed
almost
shabby
this
was
no
place
for
one
of
the
elegant
toilettes
affected
by
mademoiselle
de
companion
after
her
rouen
journey
after
her
meeting
with
lieutenant
de
loubersac
in
the
train
she
had
thought
it
wiser
not
to
go
back
to
the
baron
house
she
had
written
to
say
she
was
then
she
had
taken
refuge
in
a
quiet
little
inn
in
la
chapelle
neighbourhood
there
to
await
events
vagualame
arrest
had
made
a
terrible
impression
on
her
vagualame
had
not
betrayed
her
but
she
sensed
snares
pitfalls
all
about
her
she
might
be
trapped
any
minute
she
must
disappear
after
arrest
she
had
had
but
one
idea
to
get
rid
of
the
gun
piece
hand
it
to
the
foreign
power
and
receive
the
promised
reward
when
instead
of
corporal
vinson
whom
she
had
summoned
in
accordance
with
her
orders
she
had
perceived
fandor
she
was
puzzled
suspicious
if
bobinette
went
to
the
meeting
place
in
her
own
undisguised
person
and
met
fandor
as
fandor
it
was
because
she
had
had
the
same
idea
as
the
journalist
i
will
walk
through
the
arcades
as
bobinette
and
i
shall
see
if
corporal
vinson
is
there
or
if
by
chance
he
is
not
alone
that
same
day
at
rouen
she
had
had
a
bad
shock
the
telegram
she
had
received
at
the
garage
was
from
vagualame
how
could
an
arrested
vagualame
send
her
a
telegram
and
such
a
telegram
this
telegram
in
their
usual
cypher
informed
her
that
at
all
costs
and
at
once
she
must
separate
herself
from
corporal
vinson
who
was
not
the
real
vinson
but
a
bobinette
all
but
fainted
from
fright
she
must
escape
from
this
yet
owing
to
the
false
vinson
insistence
she
had
been
forced
to
share
his
room
he
did
not
mean
to
let
her
out
of
his
sight
that
was
plain
no
sooner
had
the
false
vinson
gone
down
to
the
car
in
the
morning
than
bobinette
had
slipped
off
hot
foot
for
rouen
the
gun
piece
was
left
behind
the
chauffeur
would
bear
the
brunt
of
that
thought
bobinette
as
she
sped
on
her
way
later
she
read
of
his
arrest
and
release
her
meeting
with
lieutenant
de
loubersac
and
the
sight
of
the
false
vinson
arrest
at
the
saint
lazare
station
showed
the
terrified
girl
that
things
had
gone
mysteriously
hopelessly
wrong
without
resources
bobinette
had
pawned
her
few
jewels
then
a
letter
from
vagualame
had
reached
her
she
had
obeyed
the
instructions
it
contained
that
he
had
learned
her
address
did
not
surprise
her
she
knew
he
never
lost
track
of
those
it
was
to
his
interest
to
keep
an
eye
on
before
vagualame
note
reached
her
she
had
been
worried
and
bored
i
must
make
sure
of
shelter
and
protection
if
needs
be
she
reflected
i
will
look
up
geoffrey
we
will
meet
at
crying
it
is
safe
there
sit
you
down
here
little
bobine
suggested
hogshead
geoffrey
and
now
what
will
you
take
bobinette
ordered
a
gooseberry
syrup
quite
the
lady
drink
remarked
mine
host
of
the
with
a
humorous
air
brother
and
sister
exchanged
confidences
the
good
geoffrey
told
of
his
fight
of
situations
obtained
and
lost
of
fisticuff
encounters
of
quarrels
and
blows
bobinette
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
she
was
very
happy
very
much
at
her
ease
just
imagine
said
she
i
am
companion
to
an
old
lady
a
russian
who
in
her
time
has
had
trouble
with
the
police
of
her
country
i
think
the
police
i
do
like
the
police
interrupted
her
brother
who
does
ejaculated
bobinette
lots
of
people
come
to
her
house
i
go
to
all
the
dinners
all
the
parties
ah
then
you
foot
the
bill
bobine
if
you
have
such
a
rich
situation
i
will
pay
geoffrey
said
bobinette
this
old
lady
i
bobinette
stopped
she
went
white
as
a
sheet
an
old
man
had
just
entered
the
his
steps
were
uncertain
his
back
was
bent
under
the
weight
of
an
old
accordion
it
was
vagualame
xxix
i
am
trokoff
bobinette
astonishment
was
so
evident
that
hogshead
geoffrey
whose
powers
of
observation
were
small
was
struck
by
his
expression
you
know
that
old
fellow
he
asked
if
he
bothers
you
you
but
to
pass
the
word
you
know
and
i
soon
put
him
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
this
amiable
offer
terrified
the
girl
she
felt
sure
vagualame
was
not
at
crying
by
chance
he
had
probably
followed
her
wished
to
have
a
word
with
her
she
must
fall
in
with
his
wishes
she
must
cut
short
this
interview
with
her
brother
after
all
it
was
only
to
pass
the
time
she
had
come
keep
quiet
geoffrey
she
said
i
do
not
know
the
old
boy
and
you
deceive
yourself
if
you
think
he
annoys
me
besides
my
dear
geoffrey
i
must
be
off
be
off
whatever
come
to
you
bobine
i
have
business
on
hand
elsewhere
and
now
that
i
know
you
are
quite
well
geoffrey
i
shall
continue
my
walk
true
protested
the
bewildered
giant
you
going
to
cut
your
stick
already
call
the
governor
there
a
piece
for
you
pay
for
your
drinks
and
keep
the
rest
was
bobinette
effective
reply
hogshead
calmed
down
at
once
as
long
as
you
pay
up
bobine
i
nothing
to
say
but
all
the
same
you
have
queer
ideas
you
bring
me
here
to
keep
an
appointment
and
then
we
not
five
minutes
together
when
up
you
get
on
the
trot
again
bobinette
caught
her
brother
huge
fist
in
a
quick
handshake
made
for
the
door
of
crying
turned
out
of
rue
monge
at
a
slow
pace
convinced
that
vagualame
would
join
her
the
street
was
deserted
bobinette
kept
in
the
shadow
avoiding
the
bright
patches
cast
on
the
silent
roadway
from
the
and
taverns
still
open
and
alight
she
had
been
walking
about
five
minutes
when
she
felt
that
someone
was
walking
behind
her
hastening
to
overtake
her
a
hand
was
laid
on
her
shoulder
vagualame
was
beside
her
regulating
his
steps
by
hers
is
that
species
of
giant
your
brother
he
asked
bobinette
nodded
you
are
free
then
she
asked
breathing
hard
it
looks
like
it
who
released
you
let
us
hurry
said
vagualame
let
us
seek
shelter
where
you
will
see
with
friends
what
did
it
matter
to
bobinette
where
they
were
going
while
strange
doubts
and
horrid
fears
filled
her
mind
who
released
you
they
were
passing
beneath
a
street
lamp
vagualame
noted
that
bobinette
was
regarding
him
with
defiant
eyes
was
this
really
vagualame
was
he
an
impostor
vagualame
read
her
thoughts
bobinette
you
are
nothing
but
a
fool
announced
the
old
accordion
player
the
man
arrested
at
your
place
was
a
detective
who
had
got
himself
up
like
me
to
take
you
in
you
let
him
trick
you
you
are
an
imbecile
bobinette
stopped
but
then
if
a
detective
made
himself
up
to
resemble
you
it
means
they
know
you
are
guilty
it
means
they
are
after
you
why
it
a
mad
thing
you
are
doing
coming
to
meet
me
in
that
rig
out
why
have
you
not
disguised
yourself
vagualame
smiled
possibly
i
have
reason
for
it
a
plan
you
know
nothing
about
bobinette
but
let
us
return
to
the
false
vagualame
how
was
it
you
did
not
detect
the
fraud
if
only
by
the
voice
how
is
it
you
have
not
guessed
the
truth
since
when
you
received
my
telegram
at
rouen
it
should
have
been
as
clear
as
daylight
to
you
eh
bobinette
kept
silence
well
we
will
not
dwell
on
the
past
declared
vagualame
with
an
air
of
magnanimity
fortunately
your
extraordinary
simplicity
has
not
had
any
particular
consequences
save
the
stupid
way
you
let
them
get
hold
of
the
gun
piece
and
allowed
the
false
corporal
vinson
to
escape
in
a
menacing
tone
he
said
we
will
return
to
that
question
later
but
faltered
bobinette
how
could
i
act
otherwise
vagualame
threw
her
such
a
look
a
look
so
charged
with
fierce
contempt
that
she
could
no
longer
doubt
that
she
was
face
to
face
with
her
master
this
master
would
not
allow
argument
discussion
well
she
knew
that
she
screwed
up
her
courage
to
ask
how
did
you
learn
my
address
that
is
my
business
he
declared
what
i
want
to
know
i
get
to
know
you
must
have
seen
that
by
this
time
how
is
it
then
you
called
at
crying
geoffrey
did
not
know
you
he
alone
knew
i
was
coming
to
see
him
you
followed
me
suppose
i
did
follow
you
vagualame
tone
changed
it
became
imperious
have
you
quite
finished
asking
me
silly
questions
i
consider
it
is
my
turn
to
put
a
question
or
two
to
you
what
are
you
doing
bobinette
bent
her
head
you
have
a
right
to
know
she
murmured
when
you
sent
me
that
letter
after
i
took
refuge
in
la
chapelle
telling
me
to
go
to
the
house
of
a
madame
olga
dimitroff
and
present
myself
for
the
post
of
companion
i
went
she
engaged
me
i
am
still
with
her
to
take
refuge
in
an
hotel
was
an
idiotic
thing
to
do
bobinette
the
police
could
easily
have
nabbed
you
there
if
they
had
had
a
mind
to
that
is
why
i
sent
you
to
one
of
my
old
friends
to
a
person
to
whom
i
could
recommend
you
well
bobinette
you
will
have
to
leave
that
house
the
young
woman
bent
her
head
mastered
ready
to
accept
any
orders
of
vagualame
before
they
were
issued
all
she
asked
in
a
timid
voice
was
where
am
i
to
go
then
far
from
here
why
vagualame
smile
was
evil
his
reply
was
like
a
series
of
sword
thrusts
because
juve
has
good
eyes
because
fandor
also
begins
to
see
clear
the
net
begins
to
tighten
i
shall
find
means
to
slip
through
it
i
am
not
of
those
who
are
caught
like
a
mouse
in
a
trap
but
as
for
you
you
with
your
simplicity
it
is
high
time
to
put
you
out
of
reach
of
the
police
i
am
going
to
give
you
some
money
five
days
hence
disguised
as
a
gipsy
you
are
to
be
on
the
road
from
sceaux
to
versailles
at
eleven
at
night
by
the
first
milestone
on
the
left
side
after
the
aeroplane
garage
you
have
followed
me
bobinette
was
trembling
disguised
as
a
gipsy
vagualame
why
that
is
no
concern
of
yours
you
have
only
to
do
as
i
tell
you
i
give
orders
but
not
explanations
vagualame
felt
in
his
pockets
he
held
out
a
you
will
find
two
notes
in
this
it
is
more
than
you
need
for
a
suitable
disguise
i
will
give
you
more
money
when
you
start
off
because
i
am
going
to
send
you
to
a
foreign
country
whilst
talking
vagualame
and
bobinette
had
gone
a
long
way
from
crying
by
a
labyrinth
of
little
streets
all
darkness
and
mystery
vagualame
had
led
his
companion
to
a
kind
of
blind
alley
a
tall
house
blocked
the
end
of
it
a
large
shop
on
the
ground
floor
occupied
half
the
front
of
it
although
the
iron
shutters
had
been
drawn
down
light
from
the
interior
penetrated
through
apertures
to
the
street
thin
rays
of
light
vagualame
laid
a
brutal
hand
on
bobinette

i
say

is
no
joking
matter

coming
in
with

friends

it
to
the
woman
who

library
address

vagualame

yes
replied
bobinette
vagualame
knocked
three
separate
times
then
twice
quickly
on
the
iron
shutters
a
key
turned
in
the
lock
the
door
opened
vagualame
thrust
bobinette
across
the
threshold
out
of
the
obscurity
of
the
streets
whipped
by
an
icy
wind
and
torrents
of
rain
bobinette
found
herself
in
a
brilliantly
lighted
she
stood
dazzled
a
young
woman
came
forward
good
evening
sophie
said
vagualame
anything
new
nothing
new
vagualame
bobinette
looked
about
her
she
saw
piles
of
books
and
collections
of
magazines
and
papers
the
shop
was
crowded
with
them
sophie
i
bring
a
new
friend
a
sure
friend
who
may
have
to
bring
you
a
letter
for
me
one
of
these
days
said
vagualame
the
proprietress
looked
curiously
at
bobinette
all
she
said
was
have
our
brothers
been
warned
vagualame
they
have
not
been
told
yet
but
i
shall
present
my
friend
to
them
at
the
first
opportunity
there
was
loud
knocking
at
the
shutters
voices
were
heard
shouting
open
open
open
the
police
bobinette
grew
ashen
with
terror
it
is
all
up
thought
the
desperate
girl
they
will
see
vagualame
is
free
they
will
find
me
with
him
we
are
caught
she
turned
frantically
to
vagualame
he
stood
calm
and
collected
ah
said
he
with
a
touch
of
raillery
looking
at
the
proprietress
they
have
been
warned
that
you
are
again
breaking
the
work
law
shaking
a
threatening
finger
at
the
rigid
sophie
vagualame
went
to
the
shop
entrance
he
looked
through
the
large
keyhole
to
see
who
was
demanding
admittance
at
this
late
hour
a
look
and
vagualame
turned
caught
sophie
by
the
arm
and
whispered
detective
juve
inspector
michel
keep
cool
sophie
they
can
not
know
all
the
ins
and
outs
of
your
place
two
strides
and
vagualame
joined
bobinette
he
dragged
her
to
the
end
of
the
shop
reached
a
corner
turned
it
and
they
were
standing
on
boards
clear
of
books
it
was
hidden
from
the
main
part
of
the
shop
and
from
the
entrance
draw
your
skirts
between
your
legs
he
commanded
do
utter
a
sound
do
be
afraid
vagualame
was
right
the
police
had
surrounded
the
mysterious
shop
noiselessly
gliding
past
the
houses
like
shadows
revolver
in
hand
dark
lantern
at
waist
fifteen
detectives
in
plain
clothes
had
converged
on
the
tall
house
in
the
blind
alley
juve
was
speaking
low
careful
michel
we
have
seen
our
birds
enter
they
are
inside
i
shall
follow
them
meanwhile
do
not
stir
from
this
door
there
is
no
other
issue
do
not
allow
a
soul
to
pass
not
one
never
fear
juve
information
dropped
by
corporal
vinson
who
had
been
taken
to
crying
by
vagualame
more
than
once
had
caused
juve
to
keep
a
strict
watch
on
the
for
some
days
he
had
seen
first
bobinette
and
then
vagualame
enter
the
place
when
bobinette
came
out
almost
immediately
he
felt
sure
she
had
not
had
time
for
a
talk
with
vagualame
when
vagualame
soon
followed
juve
had
shadowed
the
old
accordion
player
in
the
darkness
behind
him
followed
his
men
on
the
trail
of
both
when
he
saw
vagualame
and
bobinette
enter
the
library
he
exclaimed
in
thought
i
have
them
i
know
the
house
i
am
going
to
arrest
fantômas
and
his
accomplice
cool
as
a
cucumber
now
that
the
decisive
moment
was
at
hand
juve
repeated
his
instructions
he
did
not
mean
to
leave
anything
to
chance
you
understand
then
michel
not
one
single
person
is
to
leave
these
premises
even
i
can
only
be
permitted
to
pass
when
i
say
to
you
is
i
juve
let
me
pass
you
thoroughly
understand
perfectly
replied
michel
juve
turned
to
his
four
picked
men
gentlemen
are
you
ready
revolver
in
one
hand
lantern
in
the
other
juve
knocked
loudly
on
the
shuttered
shop
door
in
the
name
of
the
law
open
open
open
the
police
a
bare
three
minutes
had
elapsed
between
juve
first
summons
and
the
opening
of
the
library
door
vagualame
had
made
profitable
use
of
the
three
minutes
do
utter
a
sound
do
be
afraid
vagualame
had
repeated
to
bobinette
they
will
not
take
us
this
time
hustled
dragged
to
the
spot
already
described
bobinette
now
felt
the
ground
giving
way
beneath
her
she
rolled
on
to
a
steeply
inclined
plane
gliding
down
into
the
void
clutching
vagualame
she
heard
a
dull
sound
it
was
the
trap
falling
to
quiet
repeated
vagualame
as
bobinette
rolled
on
to
the
wood
flooring
of
a
sort
of
cellar
piled
high
with
books
he
signed
to
the
girl
to
listen
yes
they
are
searching
the
shop
knocking
the
books
about
imagining
we
are
hidden
among
them
but
from
what
i
know
of
juve
in
a
very
short
time
he
will
have
ferreted
out
the
trap
door
and
will
descend
as
we
have
done
he
will
never
be
such
a
fool
as
to
think
we
have
gone
down
the
shop
stairs
oh
groaned
bobinette
whatever
shall
we
do
vagualame
calmly
turned
on
his
pocket
electric
torch
approached
an
immense
pile
of
illustrated
magazines
stacked
in
a
corner
he
struck
three
blows
on
it
saying
in
a
low
clear
voice
open
open
to
brothers
bobinette
frightened
past
speech
saw
the
immense
pile
of
volumes
oscillate
then
noiselessly
divide
disclosing
a
secret
door
vagualame
pulled
her
towards
it
saying
in
a
joking
tone
you
see
how
useful
it
is
to
have
friends
of
all
sorts
your
employer
olga
damitroff
was
well
advised
when
she
once
told
me
when
and
where
the
nihilists
gather
together
in
paris
to
plot
against
the
czar
vagualame
brought
her
into
a
large
room
lit
by
torches
where
a
score
of
young
men
were
assembled
they
rose
and
reverently
saluted
vagualame
who
approached
them
with
outstretched
hand
when
juve
entered
he
soon
satisfied
himself
that
only
sophie
remained
in
the
library
he
gave
orders
to
keep
strict
guard
over
the
proprietress
notwithstanding
her
loud
protestations
do
not
permit
anyone
to
leave
the
premises
he
repeated
to
the
men
stationed
at
the
door
except
myself
of
course
he
turned
to
others
move
all
these
volumes
there
may
be
a
concealed
behind
them
keep
guard
at
the
top
of
the
little
staircase
it
is
the
only
way
of
escape
i
am
going
to
make
a
tour
of
the
cellars
and
expect
to
run
my
game
to
earth
by
this
sophie
again
protested
there
is
nothing
in
my
cellars
that
ought
not
to
be
there
i
understand
what
the
police
want
here
juve
paid
no
attention
to
these
protestations
he
went
towards
the
corner
at
the
farther
end
of
the
shop
juve
knew
all
the
dens
in
paris
there
was
not
a
secret
society
he
did
not
know
of
societies
political
and
otherwise
holding
mysterious
meetings
in
these
places
he
knew
of
the
existence
of
this
and
slide
which
led
to
the
cellars
below
this
library
we
will
go
down
to
the
nihilists
said
he
before
the
interested
eyes
of
his
subordinates
juve
set
the
trap
in
motion
a
counter
weight
closed
it
over
his
head
juve
rolled
into
the
cellar
but
a
few
seconds
after
vagualame
and
bobinette
had
escaped
from
it
to
tell
the
truth
juve
did
not
know
of
the
hidden
entrance
to
the
secret
room
dizzy
from
his
rapid
glide
downwards
juve
raised
his
lantern
he
was
not
surprised
to
find
this
retreat
empty
he
knew
the
slide
led
to
second
and
lower
series
of
cellars
his
eye
caught
a
movement
the
huge
stack
of
magazines
looking
as
if
it
would
topple
over
so
much
on
the
slant
was
it
was
slowly
moving
into
an
upright
position
again
he
leaped
forward
thrusting
his
revolver
between
the
opening
of
the
two
portions
and
prevented
them
from
joining
completely
what
was
going
on
behind
this
tricky
collection
of
magazines
which
had
undoubtedly
just
opened
to
give
passage
to
vagualame
and
bobinette
juve
glued
his
ear
to
the
fissure
which
marked
the
edge
of
the
hidden
door
ah
voices
of
men
in
discussion
juve
could
not
distinguish
all
that
the
voices
were
saying
but
a
word
reached
his
ear
clear
unmistakable
he
listened
intently
you
are
right
remarked
an
invisible
speaker
it
is
to
fantômas
we
owe
all
these
police
visits
and
annoyances
his
crimes
exasperate
the
police
and
to
justify
themselves
in
the
opinion
of
the
public
they
track
us
down
more
vigorously
than
ever
another
voice
answered
i
know
for
certain
that
these
coppers
are
after
fantômas
shouts
and
hoots
resounded
menacing
voices
repeated
since
fantômas
is
indirectly
our
persecutor
let
us
avenge
ourselves
on
fantômas
what
matters
one
life
compared
with
the
cause
we
defend
the
cause
of
a
whole
people
if
fantômas
is
in
our
way
troubles
us
let
us
kill
him
trokoff
will
be
here
this
evening
perhaps
trokoff
will
guide
us
trokoff
will
find
this
mysterious
bandit
who
does
us
so
much
harm
trokoff
is
a
valiant
man
we
do
not
know
him
but
we
know
what
he
has
done
juve
smiled
a
sardonic
smile
he
thrust
his
hand
into
the
opening
wedged
apart
by
his
revolver
widened
the
space
opened
the
secret
door
and
entered
the
assembly
room
of
the
nihilists
god
save
russia
juve
pronounced
these
words
with
unction
in
a
solemn
voice
god
save
poland
was
the
reply
the
oldest
man
present
who
had
thus
been
spokesman
for
the
assembly
advanced
towards
the
stranger
who
are
you
he
demanded
without
the
quiver
of
an
eyelid
an
eyelash
juve
answered
i
am
he
whom
you
have
awaited
he
who
will
direct
your
arms
guide
you
i
am
trokoff
let
but
one
of
these
inspired
fanatics
who
hold
life
cheap
guess
that
i
belong
to
the
police
and
they
would
kill
me
without
mercy
or
pity
thought
juve
as
he
faced
the
assembly
of
revolutionaries
with
a
serene
countenance
there
were
no
threatening
looks
they
believed
themselves
to
be
in
the
presence
of
trokoff
had
he
not
opened
the
door
only
trokoff
the
expected
the
longed
for
could
have
done
that
the
assembly
acclaimed
him
trokoff
we
for
russia
welcome
you
god
be
with
you
trokoff
heaven
guard
you
god
be
with
you
brothers
juve
advanced
scrutinising
each
in
turn
neither
vagualame
nor
bobinette
were
among
them
juve
addressed
them
my
brothers
you
know
that
the
police
are
now
searching
the
shop
overhead
it
is
a
serious
moment
one
of
the
nihilists
stepped
forward
we
know
it
trokoff
our
brother
vagualame
accompanied
by
a
young
disciple
came
to
warn
us
but
a
minute
ago
be
assured
brother
the
police
are
not
searching
for
us
this
evening
it
is
the
vile
wretch
fantômas
they
are
after
a
criminal
ruffian
foe
of
all
liberty
whom
we
have
condemned
to
death
therefore
we
are
not
disquieted
vagualame
has
just
left
us
he
will
direct
the
suspicions
of
the
police
into
another
channel
he
told
us
he
knew
a
way
of
quieting
their
if
only
michel
does
not
allow
this
to
slip
through
his
fingers
reflected
juve
as
he
listened
with
unmoved
countenance
to
these
remarkable
statements
before
the
nihilist
could
say
more
juve
made
a
declaration
vagualame
deceives
himself
brother
i
must
go
up
at
once
to
give
him
the
aid
of
my
strong
arm
otherwise
we
are
finished
i
know
only
the
secret
entrance
here
guide
me
to
the
other
exit
so
that
i
may
not
attract
the
attention
of
the
police
we
do
not
want
our
secret
entrance
discovered
it
shall
be
as
you
desire
brother
follow
me
but
be
prudent
marching
at
the
nihilist
heels
after
many
twists
and
turns
juve
arrived
at
the
foot
of
a
quite
ordinary
staircase
you
have
only
to
mount
brother
trokoff
these
stairs
lead
straight
into
the
shop
if
the
police
ask
where
you
come
from
you
have
only
to
say
that
you
were
looking
in
the
first
cellar
for
a
book
but
what
matters
it
if
they
do
visit
the
cellars
they
will
never
find
the
hidden
door
juve
bent
his
head
thanks
brother
peace
be
with
you
the
nihilist
turned
away
no
sooner
was
he
out
of
sight
than
juve
tore
up
the
stairs
to
complete
the
arrest
of
vagualame
and
bobinette
inspector
michel
had
not
stirred
from
his
appointed
place
by
the
door
leading
to
the
street
he
had
been
on
guard
about
half
an
hour
when
juve
livid
frantic
rushed
towards
him
you
have
let
them
go
out
michel
he
shouted
they
are
not
here
no
one
has
gone
out
at
this
door
chief
i
give
you
my
word
on
it
but
may
i
ask
how
you
managed
to
slip
back
again
without
my
having
noticed
you
deuced
clever
i
call
it
no
one
i
say
has
left
these
premises
either
before
or
after
you
what
that
you
say
juve
stared
at
michel
as
if
he
had
taken
leave
of
his
senses
what
i
say
chief
is
the
only
individuals
whom
i
have
allowed
to
pass
out
are
you
and
your
woman
prisoner
i
and
my
woman
prisoner
juve
could
have
howled
with
rage
he
caught
the
calm
collected
michel
by
the
coat
collar
and
dragged
him
outside
the
shop
juve
looked
so
desperate
so
at
his
wit
end
that
michel
wondered
come
now
chief
he
remonstrated
i
am
not
dreaming
am
i
ten
minutes
ago
you
came
to
me
here
and
you
said
move
michel
let
me
pass
i
am
juve
i
take
a
prisoner
to
the
station
and
will
return
juve
had
grown
deadly
calm
i
was
disguised
michel
was
i
not
yes
you
had
put
on
your
vagualame
disguise
juve
bit
his
lip
till
the
blood
came
that
had
done
him
again
juve
could
not
but
admire
his
coolness
and
resource
he
had
known
how
to
take
in
michel
because
michel
had
arrested
juve
when
disguised
as
vagualame
at
de
naarboveck
house
michel
would
naturally
think
his
chief
had
again
assumed
the
vagualame
disguise
for
a
purpose
oh
it
was
the
devil
own
cleverness
juve
glared
at
michel
it
was
the
real
vagualame
i
tell
you
shouted
juve
it
was
not
i
disguised
as
vagualame
it
was
vagualame
in
person
i
tell
you
it
is
vagualame
himself
whom
you
have
allowed
to
escape
there
was
a
pause
terrible
michel
drew
himself
up
what
then
chief
juve
anger
gave
place
to
compassion
it
is
really
not
your
fault
my
poor
michel
how
could
you
imagine
the
infernal
trick
this
bandit
was
playing
on
you
i
bear
you
no
grudge
for
it
michel
but
michel
was
inconsolable
he
had
committed
an
irreparable
blunder
juve
slipped
his
arm
through
that
of
his
miserable
subordinate
the
pair
made
their
way
to
headquarters
at
the
head
of
the
little
column
of
subordinates
who
understanding
that
juve
had
not
found
what
he
sought
were
cursing
inwardly
at
the
failure
of
their
expedition
the
moment
juve
realised
that
michel
had
allowed
to
escape
he
had
called
off
his
men
he
did
not
wish
the
russian
revolutionaries
cornered
and
arrested
at
present
possibly
vagualame
believed
juve
and
his
men
had
come
to
find
the
nihilists
and
having
failed
had
left
the
premises
in
a
rage
sophie
would
report
to
the
bandit
but
she
had
not
heard
everything
thought
juve
he
will
hardly
guess
that
i
entered
the
assembly
below
by
the
secret
door
and
made
them
believe
i
was
trokoff
it
leaves
a
way
open
for
future
transactions
some
day
not
so
far
ahead
i
may
return
may
find
that
devil
will
o
the
wisp
of
a
bandit
there
and
nab
him
at
last
did
michel
suspect
there
were
nihilists
on
the
premises
tell
me
questioned
juve
did
you
overhear
any
suspicious
talk
this
sophie
did
not
say
anything
interesting
nothing
whatever
chief
your
men
michel
do
not
know
what
individual
we
are
after
michel
laughed
oh
they
are
a
hundred
leagues
off
the
truth
that
they
were
out
to
arrest
fantômas
just
imagine
chief
this
afternoon
a
complaint
was
lodged
at
headquarters
with
reference
to
the
theft
of
a
bear
the
theft
was
committed
at
troyes
at
the
fair
our
men
are
persuaded
that
search
has
to
do
with
this
case
all
the
more
so
because
just
as
we
started
on
this
expedition
one
of
my
men
whose
home
is
at
sceaux
told
us
that
his
brother
a
driver
down
there
had
been
ordered
to
go
in
five
time
with
two
horses
and
at
five
in
the
morning
on
the
road
to
robinson
and
take
a
gipsy
van
twenty
kilometres
from
there
he
thought
there
was
something
very
queer
about
such
a
rendezvous
as
that
juve
interest
in
this
piece
of
news
was
keen
xxx
appalling
accusations
but
commandant
you
can
not
possibly
maintain
that
i
am
not
jérôme
fandor
journalist
the
interview
between
commandant
dumoulin
and
fandor
had
already
lasted
an
hour
it
was
unlike
that
which
had
taken
place
six
days
before
when
dumoulin
had
dealt
summarily
with
the
case
since
then
fandor
had
occupied
cell
and
had
had
no
communication
with
the
outside
world
fandor
had
raged
furiously
against
things
in
general
against
dumoulin
in
particular
and
against
himself
most
of
all
he
acknowledged
that
juve
had
done
his
utmost
to
extricate
him
from
the
tangled
web
he
had
involved
himself
in
as
each
day
brought
him
one
distraction
which
he
would
willingly
have
foregone
he
passed
long
exhausting
hours
in
commandant
office
he
found
the
commandant
detestable
dumoulin
was
noisy
unmethodical
always
in
a
state
of
fuss
and
fume
he
would
begin
his
interrogations
calmly
would
weigh
his
words
would
be
logical
but
little
by
little
his
real
nature
a
tempestuous
one
would
get
the
upper
hand
for
the
twentieth
time
fandor
had
insisted
on
his
identity
and
dumoulin
tapping
the
case
papers
with
an
agitated
hand
had
replied
i
recognise
that
you
are
jérôme
fandor
exercising
the
profession
of
a
journalist
since
it
seems
journalism
is
a
profession
but
that
is
not
the
question
the
problem
i
have
to
elucidate
i
have
to
ascertain
when
and
at
what
exact
moment
one
jérôme
fandor
took
the
personality
of
corporal
vinson
i
have
already
told
you
commandant
please
read
my
deposition
of
the
day
before
yesterday
i
will
recapitulate
sunday
november
at
five
in
the
evening
at
my
domicile
rue
richer
i
received
the
visit
of
a
soldier
whom
i
did
not
know
he
stated
that
he
was
called
corporal
vinson
and
informed
me
that
he
had
become
part
and
parcel
of
the
spy
system
that
he
regretted
it
and
not
being
able
to
extricate
himself
he
was
going
to
commit
suicide
desiring
to
give
this
unfortunate
a
chance
of
rehabilitating
himself
desiring
also
to
come
to
close
quarters
with
this
gang
of
spies
i
decided
to
assume
his
personality
and
take
advantage
of
his
entrance
into
a
regiment
where
he
was
not
known
and
to
go
there
in
his
place
it
was
in
these
conditions
that
i
left
eight
days
after
on
sunday
november
for
verdun
you
maintain
that
you
did
not
assume
the
personality
of
vinson
before
that
date
i
do
maintain
that
commandant
but
that
is
the
pivot
of
the
whole
business
and
the
important
point
yet
to
be
proved
that
is
not
difficult
declared
fandor
i
have
alibis
who
will
support
my
statement
the
commandant
raised
his
arms
to
heaven
alibis
alibis
what
do
they
prove
after
all
the
truth
commandant
when
i
am
in
paris
it
is
evident
i
am
not
in
châlons
or
verdun
dumoulin
was
evidently
trying
to
find
an
argument
to
meet
the
accused
logic
peuh
declared
he
with
fellows
like
you
who
are
perpetually
disguising
themselves
changing
their
faces
as
i
change
my
collars
one
never
suddenly
dumoulin
face
lighted
up
tuesday
november
you
were
in
the
shoes
of
vinson
is
that
so
yes
commandant
very
well
this
same
tuesday
november
you
were
at
the
elysée
ball
as
jérôme
fandor
so
you
see
dumoulin
was
triumphant
i
had
hours
leave
commandant
quite
regular
protested
fandor
ah
growled
the
commandant
glancing
knowingly
at
lieutenant
servin
who
with
impassive
countenance
was
listening
to
this
discussion
do
talk
to
me
about
leave
heaven
alone
knows
how
easily
you
spies
succeed
in
obtaining
leave
fandor
was
about
to
protest
vehemently
against
being
numbered
with
the
spies
when
the
commandant
started
another
subject
added
to
this
there
is
something
very
serious
in
your
case
good
heavens
what
now
ejaculated
fandor
dumoulin
looked
mysterious
we
will
speak
of
it
later
on
the
next
step
is
to
confront
you
with
certain
witnesses
lieutenant
servin
see
if
the
witnesses
are
there
fandor
himself
had
demanded
this
confrontation
he
did
not
deny
having
assumed
the
personality
of
corporal
vinson
dating
from
the
day
when
the
corporal
entered
officially
on
his
duties
as
a
unit
of
the
of
the
line
in
garrison
at
verdun
but
the
enquiry
wished
to
establish
that
anterior
to
this
fandor
had
already
taken
the
place
of
the
real
vinson
the
military
authorities
seemed
to
attach
immense
importance
to
this
point
fandor
had
then
decided
that
the
simplest
way
was
to
be
brought
face
to
face
with
soldiers
who
had
known
vinson
at
châlons
they
would
state
that
the
vinson
presented
to
them
in
the
person
of
fandor
was
not
the
vinson
they
had
known
thereupon
dumoulin
had
sent
for
two
men
who
as
orderlies
at
châlons
had
lived
side
by
side
with
vinson
there
was
a
momentous
silence
while
lieutenant
servin
went
to
the
end
of
the
corridor
and
signed
to
the
two
waiting
witnesses
to
come
forward
the
two
men
entered
the
commandant
office
facing
dumoulin
in
true
military
style
dumoulin
reading
out
the
names
of
the
two
witnesses
from
a
paper
started
his
interrogation
with
a
haughty
air
hiloire
present
commandant
what
is
your
name
the
soldier
opened
his
eyes
wide
and
thinking
he
had
to
give
his
christian
name
stammered
justinien
what
growled
the
commandant
you
are
not
called
hiloire
the
bewildered
man
attempted
some
confused
explanations
from
which
it
could
be
gathered
that
hiloire
was
his
surname
and
justinien
his
baptismal
name
good
declared
the
commandant
who
proceeded
to
question
the
second
soldier
as
to
his
identity
when
it
was
made
clear
that
he
was
one
tarbottin
baptismal
name
niccodème
the
commandant
questioned
them
together
you
are
soldiers
of
the
second
class
in
the
of
the
line
and
fulfil
the
functions
of
staff
orderlies
yes
commandant
you
know
corporal
vinson
yes
commandant
dumoulin
pointed
to
fandor
is
he
corporal
vinson
yes
commandant
repeated
the
two
soldiers
lieutenant
servin
intervened
he
pointed
out
to
his
chief
that
the
witnesses
had
replied
in
the
affirmative
without
turning
to
look
at
the
supposed
corporal
the
commandant
cried
angrily
what
kind
of
imbeciles
are
you
before
saying
that
you
recognise
a
person
you
must
begin
by
looking
at
that
person
look
at
the
corporal
the
two
soldiers
obeyed
they
turned
with
precision
and
stared
at
fandor
is
that
man
corporal
vinson
yes
commandant
you
are
sure
of
that
no
commandant
despite
the
miserable
position
he
found
himself
in
fandor
could
not
help
smiling
at
the
bewilderment
of
the
two
soldiers
it
was
evident
they
could
be
made
to
say
anything
the
commandant
was
growing
more
and
more
exasperated
what
that
he
shouted
i
will
give
you
eight
days
in
the
cells
if
you
continue
to
play
the
fool
like
this
try
to
understand
what
you
are
doing
do
you
even
know
why
you
are
here
after
consulting
each
other
with
a
look
as
to
who
should
answer
tarbottin
explained
it
is
the
sergeant
who
told
us
that
we
were
being
sent
to
paris
to
recognise
corporal
vinson
well
then
well
continued
hiloire
we
recognised
him
then
speaking
together
with
an
air
of
proud
satisfaction
yes
we
got
our
orders
we
have
carried
them
out
the
commandant
was
scarlet
with
a
violent
blow
of
his
fist
he
sent
three
sets
of
case
papers
flying
to
the
ground
he
turned
to
lieutenant
servin
i
fail
to
understand
why
the
staff
captain
has
expressly
sent
us
the
biggest
fools
he
could
lay
hands
on
what
the
deuce
can
you
get
out
of
such
a
pair
has
the
counter
verification
been
carried
out
have
they
been
shown
the
body
of
the
real
corporal
vinson
lieutenant
servin
replied
that
this
had
been
done
and
what
did
they
declare
nothing
definite
i
may
say
they
were
very
much
moved
at
the
sight
of
the
corpse
also
that
it
is
decomposing
rapidly
here
fandor
broke
in
commandant
i
am
extremely
surprised
that
you
thought
it
necessary
to
summon
only
two
soldiers
it
is
at
least
strange
i
have
the
right
to
expect
that
in
the
conduct
of
the
enquiry
connected
with
the
action
you
wish
to
bring
against
me
you
should
proceed
more
seriously
than
you
are
doing
at
present
a
magistrate
should
be
impartial
the
commandant
had
risen
he
bent
towards
fandor
across
his
fandor
also
had
risen
dumoulin
air
was
threatening
he
was
furious
what
do
you
mean
by
that
he
shouted
i
mean
to
say
burst
out
fandor
that
for
the
last
hours
you
have
given
proofs
of
a
revolting
partiality
against
me
for
a
minute
dumoulin
drew
himself
up
crimson
choking
he
was
an
embodied
protest
suddenly
he
dropped
the
official
and
became
the
he
cried
but
i
am
an
honest
man
dumoulin
was
a
worthy
official
of
the
old
school
whatever
his
temperamental
drawbacks
he
undoubtedly
aimed
at
a
conscientious
conduct
of
any
case
he
had
in
charge
fandor
had
made
an
exceedingly
bad
impression
on
him
he
had
been
scandalised
that
a
civilian
a
mere
journalist
had
dared
to
treat
the
army
with
contempt
by
so
lightly
taking
the
place
of
a
real
soldier
unquestionably
there
were
grave
presumptions
of
fandor
guilt
that
was
dumoulin
opinion
considering
the
importance
of
the
affair
the
terrible
consequences
which
might
ensue
for
the
accused
were
the
case
to
go
against
him
it
was
imperative
that
the
enquiry
should
be
thorough
down
to
the
minutest
detail
the
commandant
well
knew
the
weak
points
in
his
procedure
there
was
this
confrontation
with
the
absurd
testimonies
of
the
two
soldiers
it
had
proved
a
ridiculous
fiasco
also
he
would
have
great
difficulty
in
showing
conclusively
that
fandor
had
been
a
certain
time
at
châlons
under
vinson
uniform
dumoulin
mastering
his
emotion
resumed
his
official
tone
fandor
he
stopped
short
glared
indignantly
at
the
two
soldiers
planted
in
the
middle
of
the
room
what
are
you
two
up
to
now
he
cried
the
ridiculous
pair
saluted
but
did
not
reply
lieutenant
remove
those
men
we
do
not
want
any
more
of
them
here
take
them
out
of
my
sight
growled
dumoulin
the
commandant
felt
he
must
have
a
breath
of
fresh
air
collect
his
thoughts
and
calm
down
before
resuming
conduct
of
the
case
we
shall
continue
this
interrogation
in
ten
minutes
time
he
announced
and
left
the
room
the
short
interval
had
done
its
work
the
commandant
had
calmed
down
fandor
had
regained
his
no
longer
was
it
an
irascible
officer
facing
an
inimical
accused
two
men
were
prepared
to
argue
and
talk
together
the
formal
interrogation
recommenced
fandor
began
the
commandant
in
an
amiable
tone
you
have
evidently
been
drawn
on
by
unforeseen
events
to
commit
irregularities
name
your
accomplices
fandor
replied
in
a
similar
tone
no
commandant
i
have
not
been
drawn
into
the
spy
circle
really
nor
have
i
practised
spying
i
considered
it
right
to
assume
the
personality
of
corporal
vinson
solely
to
obtain
information
regarding
the
relations
this
unfortunate
maintained
compulsorily
and
quite
against
his
better
judgment
with
the
agents
of
a
foreign
power
when
i
had
obtained
the
facts
i
sought
my
intention
was
to
leave
the
law
to
deal
with
them
in
other
words
said
dumoulin
you
aimed
at
playing
the
if
you
like
to
put
it
so
the
commandant
smiled
ironically
they
always
say
that
in
the
course
of
my
career
monsieur
fandor
i
have
had
to
examine
three
or
four
spy
cases
well
the
defence
of
the
guilty
man
is
always
the
same
you
have
taken
up
an
identical
position
i
sell
secret
documents
in
exchange
for
more
important
ones
this
system
of
defence
will
not
hold
water
i
can
not
take
up
any
other
position
declared
fandor
the
council
will
take
that
at
its
proper
value
announced
the
commandant
fandor
was
asking
himself
how
he
was
going
to
get
out
of
a
position
that
was
growing
worse
and
that
in
a
very
curious
way
the
commandant
next
question
struck
a
shrewd
blow
at
the
accused
fandor
how
about
those
accomplices
you
refuse
to
name
have
they
not
remunerated
you
for
your
pains
what
do
you
mean
to
imply
by
that
demanded
fandor
have
they
not
given
you
money
no
think
carefully
and
be
frank
fandor
ransacked
his
memory
ah
what
of
that
interview
in
the
printing
works
of
the
noret
brothers
would
it
be
best
in
accordance
with
his
aims
to
deny
it
it
went
against
the
grain
of
his
naturally
frank
nature
to
tell
such
a
lie
nevertheless
he
had
vowed
to
himself
a
vow
that
he
would
not
reveal
what
he
had
learned
it
would
be
a
grave
mistake
at
present
he
lowered
his
head
as
he
persisted
in
his
declaration
no
commandant
i
have
not
received
money
from
the
spies
the
commandant
called
to
the
reporter
make
a
special
note
of
that
underline
it
with
red
pencil
this
is
a
most
important
statement
the
commandant
turned
over
some
papers
in
his
drawer
drew
out
a
sealed
envelope
opened
it
extracted
another
envelope
fandor
asked
himself
with
a
thrill
of
foreboding
what
this
new
move
of
the
commandant
meant
from
a
third
envelope
dumoulin
took
out
several
yellowed
and
crumpled
he
held
them
up
for
fandor
to
see
here
are
three
fifty
franc
new
ones
they
bear
the
following
numbers
a
o
u
they
were
found
with
others
concealed
in
your
baggage
at
the
barracks
at
verdun
do
you
recognise
these
notes
as
having
been
in
your
possession
how
do
you
think
i
can
know
that
countered
fandor
one
is
not
distinguishable
from
another
yes
they
are
by
the
numbering
asserted
the
commandant
i
willingly
admit
that
it
is
not
usual
to
write
down
for
reference
the
number
of
every
which
passes
through
one
hands
we
have
a
better
way
of
demonstrating
that
the
notes
i
have
in
my
hand
were
in
your
possession
what
exactly
is
he
going
to
spring
upon
me
now
fandor
asked
himself
there
was
an
impressive
pause
these
notes
declared
dumoulin
have
been
carefully
examined
by
the
anthropometric
service
it
has
been
demonstrated
that
they
bear
distinct
traces
of
your
i
hope
monsieur
fandor
that
you
do
not
contest
the
exactitude
of
the
bertillion
method
no
replied
fandor
simply
i
accept
the
evidence
of
the
anthropometric
method
the
commandant
looked
more
and
more
satisfied
you
acknowledge
then
that
these
notes
were
in
your
possession
yes
i
do
the
commandant
again
addressed
the
reporter
note
that
important
confession
underline
it
with
red
pencil
dumoulin
fired
a
question
at
fandor
did
you
know
captain
brocq
no
you
did
know
him
insisted
the
commandant
no
repeated
fandor
he
questioned
in
his
turn
why
the
commandant
hesitated
then
continued
you
are
not
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
an
important
document
was
stolen
from
the
domicile
of
this
mysteriously
murdered
man
i
know
it
admitted
fandor
that
is
not
all
continued
dumoulin
a
certain
amount
of
money
was
also
stolen
from
this
unfortunate
officer
now
brocq
was
in
the
habit
of
putting
down
in
his
the
exact
sums
he
possessed
and
mark
this
well
also
entering
the
numbers
of
his
now
have
disappeared
from
his
cash
drawer
the
missing
notes
bear
the
numbers
a
o
u
the
very
notes
found
in
your
there
ensued
a
dreadful
silence
fandor
was
thunderstruck
everything
seemed
in
league
against
him
oh
he
was
caught
like
a
mouse
in
a
trap
these
must
be
the
notes
that
the
man
probably
one
of
the
noret
brothers
had
slipped
into
his
hand
evidently
from
the
time
of
his
leaving
paris
in
corporal
uniform
the
traitorous
gang
he
meant
to
expose
had
known
him
for
what
he
was
without
suspecting
it
he
had
been
the
hunted
instead
of
the
hunter
and
this
chaser
of
damaged
goods
and
trumpery
wares
had
been
caught
in
his
trap
like
a
fool
these
unscrupulous
wretches
had
hatched
an
abominable
plot
against
him
fandor
felt
that
each
instant
saw
him
deeper
in
the
toils
his
whole
being
was
invaded
by
a
terrible
anxiety
an
immense
fear
who
could
be
so
powerful
so
subtle
so
formidable
as
to
have
made
a
fool
of
him
in
such
a
fashion
to
have
led
him
into
such
traps
that
even
juve
himself
could
do
nothing
to
save
him
one
being
and
one
only
was
capable
of
such
a
diabolically
clever
performance
and
fandor
who
would
not
believe
it
some
weeks
before
when
discussing
the
question
with
juve
had
now
to
accept
his
hypothesis
as
a
certainty
his
acts
caused
his
unseen
personality
to
hit
you
in
the
eyes
only
one
person
could
pull
the
strings
with
such
a
demon
hand
yes
fandor
could
no
longer
doubt
that
his
desperate
plight
was
due
to
the
terrific
odious
elusive
fantômas
our
journalist
was
now
in
the
lowest
depths
he
attempted
to
keep
calm
and
cool
but
he
had
lost
grip
of
himself
he
stammered
he
mumbled
confusedly
justifications
excuses
charging
the
noret
brothers
with
having
given
him
those
terrible
dumoulin
on
his
side
was
convinced
that
his
examination
had
made
an
immense
step
in
the
right
direction
he
considered
that
the
interrogation
might
well
end
with
a
last
word
a
last
sentence
he
turned
to
the
wretched
fandor
and
in
tones
of
the
utmost
solemnity
administered
his
finishing
stroke
jérôme
fandor
not
only
are
you
accused
of
the
crimes
of
treason
and
spying
but
taking
into
account
the
formal
avowals
you
have
just
made
i
here
and
now
declare
you
guilty
of
the
assassination
of
captain
brocq
of
the
theft
of
his
documents
and
of
his
money
xxxi
a
caravan
drama
the
night
was
dark
and
stormy
on
the
sceaux
road
a
gipsy
was
braving
the
tempest
making
difficult
headway
in
the
teeth
of
a
gale
which
flapped
her
long
cloak
with
impeding
force
soaked
her
to
the
skin
dashed
masses
of
water
in
her
face
plastered
streaming
locks
to
her
forehead
taking
her
breath
with
its
suffocating
rush
shielding
her
mouth
with
her
hand
the
gipsy
pressed
steadily
forward
a
church
struck
eleven
slow
strokes
borne
on
the
wind
lashed
by
the
tempest
the
gipsy
pressed
on
muttering
as
she
moved
vagualame
told
me
that
he
would
be
at
the
first
milestone
beyond
the
aviation
sheds
i
must
get
there
i
will
get
there
it
was
bobinette
struggling
on
in
blind
obedience
to
him
whom
she
considered
her
master
towards
the
strange
fixed
by
the
bandit
five
days
ago
under
her
looks
of
parisian
delicacy
bobinette
had
a
valiant
spirit
a
temperament
and
a
will
of
steel
bobinette
wished
to
reach
the
appointed
she
would
reach
it
but
gipsy
bobinette
had
her
fears
she
was
painfully
impressed
by
the
obscurity
of
the
night
sinister
menacing
from
the
marshy
fields
flanking
her
to
right
and
left
unaccustomed
sounds
weird
noises
reached
her
straining
ears
through
the
gusty
darkness
then
what
did
her
master
want
with
her
here
and
at
such
an
hour
never
had
bobinette
confessed
to
herself
that
vagualame
real
identity
was
unknown
to
her
what
dark
personality
was
hid
behind
that
familiar
figure
she
asked
herself
that
now
with
shuddering
apprehension
she
had
remarked
certain
coincidences
noted
certain
details
she
divined
that
this
enigmatic
accordion
player
might
well
be
none
other
than
fantômas
fantômas
that
name
was
it
not
a
frightful
symbol
of
all
the
crimes
all
the
atrocities
the
monstrous
synthesis
of
unpunished
evil
in
her
tormented
brain
those
three
syllables
of
sinister
intent
were
sounding
like
a
funeral
knell
at
thought
of
fantômas
and
vagualame
bobinette
heart
fainted
within
her
yet
prey
to
haunting
terrors
as
she
was
bobinette
pressed
unfalteringly
forward
towards
what
fate
held
for
her
one
reassuring
thought
came
to
hearten
her
at
every
step
she
took
the
sequins
of
her
gipsy
circlet
moved
and
shook
and
tinkled
on
her
forehead
they
reminded
her
of
the
words
chanted
by
the
old
dealer
when
he
sold
her
the
string
of
sequins
words
from
the
celebrated
song
of
the
andalusian
gipsies
the
coral
shines
on
my
skin
so
brown
the
pin
of
gold
in
my
chignon
i
go
in
search
of
my
fortune
was
she
truly
hastening
towards
good
fortune
through
this
night
of
wind
and
rain
why
not
bobinette
felt
comforted
she
said
to
herself
that
since
vagualame
had
summoned
her
to
meet
him
in
gipsy
costume
it
must
be
because
he
intended
to
help
her
to
escape
otherwise
why
had
he
foreseen
the
necessity
for
such
a
disguise
to
make
sure
of
finding
the
rendezvous
she
had
taken
a
reconnoitering
journey
along
the
sceaux
road
the
night
before
she
knew
now
she
was
close
to
the
famous
milestone
bobinette
jumped
as
though
she
would
leap
out
of
her
skin
on
the
left
side
of
the
road
tall
trees
stripped
of
their
leaves
stood
swaying
like
skeletons
in
the
wind
just
there
her
eyes
had
seen
something
dark
a
black
patch
blacker
than
the
surrounding
night
what
was
it
a
strange
sound
issued
from
the
darkness
a
low
dull
deep
complaining
sound
breathed
from
some
infernal
throat
was
it
a
cry
a
growl
a
snarl
she
halted
shivering
with
fright
her
ears
humming
her
heart
contracted
in
the
grip
of
an
indescribable
terror
doubting
her
senses
doubting
the
reality
of
the
sound
she
had
heard
bobinette
stood
motionless
the
wind
whistling
through
the
branches
conveyed
another
sound
to
her
senses
she
heard
a
mocking
voice
harsh
imperious
a
menacing
voice
a
voice
whose
orders
she
had
obeyed
many
a
time
and
oft
a
voice
she
had
never
heard
without
secret
terror
the
voice
of
her
master
vagualame
go
forward
you
fool
why
do
you
halt
as
though
galvanised
bobinette
with
a
supreme
effort
of
will
obeyed
a
few
seconds
and
she
was
by
the
side
of
vagualame
who
had
come
to
meet
her
did
you
hear
she
gasped
i
heard
the
bellowing
of
the
wind
laughed
vagualame
i
heard
the
sound
of
sleety
rain
i
heard
the
noise
of
trees
writhing
and
creaking
in
the
wind
nothing
more
someone
or
something
cried
out
who
could
we
are
alone
here
bobinette
you
are
alone
here
with
me
there
was
a
pause
vagualame
voice
was
once
more
mocking
am
i
to
think
you
are
afraid
no
vagualame
i
am
not
afraid
but
you
are
trembling
like
a
leaf
cried
vagualame
with
a
burst
of
laughter
which
sounded
strangely
false
he
seized
bobinette
in
an
iron
grip
and
forced
her
forward
come
come
under
shelter
they
moved
towards
the
black
blot
bobinette
had
not
yet
identified
almost
directly
they
were
leaning
against
a
gipsy
van
drawn
up
at
the
side
of
the
road
your
future
domicile
said
vagualame
showing
the
van
to
the
bewildered
bobinette
but
this
is
not
the
time
to
install
yourself
there
are
things
to
be
said
first
between
you
and
me
bobinette
the
bandit
was
enveloped
from
head
to
foot
in
a
dark
cloak
all
bobinette
could
see
of
him
was
his
profile
his
features
were
concealed
by
a
soft
felt
hat
with
brim
which
showed
at
intervals
against
the
sky
when
the
lightning
flashed
and
flickered
the
girl
shivered
her
master
last
words
were
full
of
some
dark
menace
what
do
you
want
to
say
she
murmured
vagualame
took
a
few
steps
forward
then
returned
to
where
the
girl
was
leaning
against
the
van
listen
to
me
bobinette
listen
for
by
heaven
the
words
i
am
about
to
utter
are
the
last
you
will
ever
hear
before
bobinette
could
interrupt
vagualame
continued
tell
me
do
you
know
of
anything
more
wicked
more
contemptible
more
vile
more
shameful
than
treachery
than
betrayal
than
a
trap
set
a
snare
laid
to
catch
one
who
has
always
been
your
friend
your
defender
tell
me
bobinette
who
is
more
hateful
than
the
judas
who
sells
you
with
a
kiss
tell
me
bobinette
who
is
less
worthy
of
pity
than
the
cowardly
criminal
who
betrays
his
accomplice
than
the
bandit
who
delivers
up
his
chief
for
money
perhaps
for
less
than
money
because
of
fear
who
betrays
his
master
to
save
his
own
skin
bobinette
did
not
seem
to
understand
one
word
of
this
apostrophe
she
kept
silence
terrified
crushed
in
front
of
the
awful
abyss
she
divined
vagualame
seized
her
by
the
shoulders
and
shook
her
brutally
thrusting
her
fiercely
against
the
side
of
the
van
speak
reply
bobinette
i
command
you
i
do
not
understand
you
i
am
afraid
a
shout
of
ferocious
laughter
burst
from
vagualame
you
do
not
understand
me
you
are
afraid
ah
if
you
are
afraid
it
is
because
you
understand
well
enough
bobinette
you
know
well
enough
what
i
have
to
reproach
you
with
what
i
have
to
force
you
to
expiate
a
hoarse
cry
escaped
the
girl
parched
lips
you
are
mad
mad
vagualame
pity
pity
in
a
voice
so
hard
so
biting
that
the
words
seemed
arrows
piercing
her
quivering
flesh
the
bandit
addressed
his
victim
bobinette
you
deceive
yourself
strangely
i
am
not
of
those
to
whom
one
cries
for
pity
i
know
not
the
word
nor
such
weakness
i
have
never
had
it
and
never
shall
have
it
for
any
living
soul
the
bandit
paused
then
in
a
tone
of
rising
anger
he
continued
and
you
think
me
mad
but
what
sort
of
woman
are
you
bobinette
to
try
and
deceive
me
what
madness
is
yours
to
think
to
imagine
you
can
dupe
me
to
confess
that
with
such
words
and
speeches
as
your
feminine
mind
can
think
of
you
are
going
to
ensnare
me
make
me
alter
my
decision
turn
me
from
my
vengeance
that
you
should
decide
how
i
shall
act
i
i
vagualame
the
bandit
pronounced
i
with
such
an
accent
of
authority
with
such
terrific
pride
that
bobinette
with
a
sound
as
though
the
death
rattle
were
in
her
throat
cried
vagualame
who
are
you
tell
me
tell
me
you
ask
me
who
i
am
you
wish
to
know
it
be
according
to
your
wish
who
am
i
look
slowly
with
a
movement
firm
and
dignified
vagualame
unfolded
the
long
cloak
which
enveloped
him
he
tore
off
his
hat
and
flung
it
at
his
feet
with
arms
crossed
he
apostrophied
bobinette
dare
to
utter
my
name
dare
to
name
me
before
bobinette
distracted
eyes
a
terrifying
outline
showed
itself
the
beggar
of
a
moment
ago
his
cloak
removed
his
hat
thrown
to
the
ground
appeared
no
more
a
bent
old
man
he
stood
there
upright
young
vigorous
superbly
muscular
he
was
sheathed
from
head
to
foot
in
a
garment
black
as
erebus
bobinette
could
not
see
his
face
a
black
hood
covered
it
two
gleaming
eyes
alone
were
visible
eyes
that
to
the
distraught
girl
seemed
lit
by
fires
from
hell
this
vision
the
vision
of
this
man
without
a
face
resembling
no
other
man
this
apparition
with
nameless
mask
its
body
like
some
statue
cut
from
solid
darkness
was
yet
so
definite
in
its
mystery
that
bobinette
uttering
the
indescribable
cry
of
some
inhuman
thing
articulated
fantômas
you
are
fantômas
the
bandit
spoke
i
am
fantômas
i
am
he
for
whom
the
entire
world
is
searching
whom
none
has
ever
seen
whom
none
can
recognise
i
am
crime
incarnated
i
am
night
no
human
sees
my
face
because
crime
and
night
are
featureless
i
am
illimitable
power
i
am
he
who
mocks
at
all
the
powers
at
all
the
efforts
at
all
the
forces
i
am
master
of
all
of
everything
of
all
times
and
seasons
i
am
death
bobinette
thou
hast
said
it
i
am
fantômas
his
wretched
listener
could
not
breathe
she
felt
death
in
her
veins
she
felt
the
earth
dissolving
into
dust
she
sank
on
her
knees
pity
master
pity
fantômas
have
pity
you
join
those
words
together
fantômas
and
pity
a
furious
anger
seized
the
bandit
fantômas
knows
not
what
mercy
is
i
tell
you
fantômas
ordains
that
whoso
resist
him
shall
perish
shall
disappear
but
master
what
have
i
done
master
fantômas
what
have
i
done
slowly
the
bandit
enveloped
himself
once
more
in
his
cloak
bobinette
was
on
her
knees
as
one
nailed
to
the
earth
fantômas
had
hypnotised
her
into
immobility
as
the
bird
is
hypnotised
by
the
cat
watching
its
prey
he
played
with
her
he
could
seize
and
master
her
at
his
pleasure
in
a
voice
cold
and
hard
as
the
nether
millstone
he
denounced
his
victim
bobinette
you
aimed
at
my
betrayal
you
pointed
out
the
nihilist
haunt
to
juve
to
fandor
to
my
most
personal
enemies
to
those
who
would
hound
me
to
the
guillotine
i
never
did
i
did
not
do
it
i
swear
it
shrieked
the
maddened
girl
fantômas
convinced
that
bobinette
and
she
alone
was
the
traitor
here
you
are
to
die
but
not
by
my
hand
the
hand
of
fantômas
does
not
deal
death
to
those
who
once
served
him
to
the
traitorous
wretches
once
in
his
employ
but
you
shall
die
bobinette
i
deliver
you
to
death
fantômas
laughed
he
laughed
because
the
body
of
this
woman
huddled
in
the
mud
crushed
to
the
earth
was
a
pleasing
thing
because
fantômas
was
happy
when
he
made
human
creatures
suffer
when
he
tortured
when
he
wrought
sweet
vengeance
far
away
sounded
the
church
bells
the
carillon
was
ringing
church
bells
were
chiming
through
the
night
to
bobinette
the
abject
creature
grovelling
in
the
mire
of
the
roadway
the
bells
sounded
vaguely
serene
far
far
away
she
seemed
to
be
floating
in
some
indefinable
element
floating
like
thistledown
on
an
irresistible
breeze
suddenly
she
had
the
sensation
that
she
was
sinking
falling
that
she
was
rolling
down
down
into
the
depths
of
a
bottomless
abyss
when
she
opened
her
eyes
tried
to
move
sat
up
she
knew
she
was
not
dreaming
she
knew
she
had
lost
consciousness
and
was
coming
back
to
life
she
asked
herself
could
she
possibly
be
alive
fantômas
had
threatened
her
with
death
and
yet
she
lived
where
was
she
bobinette
felt
so
weak
and
giddy
that
she
remained
in
a
sitting
posture
what
exactly
had
happened
ah
yes
when
fantômas
had
announced
she
was
to
die
she
had
fallen
down
on
the
road
her
skirt
was
still
wet
and
muddy
her
testing
fingers
told
her
that
she
was
cold
what
had
happened
since
bobinette
heard
the
wind
blowing
rain
as
still
falling
but
she
noticed
none
fell
on
her
face
where
am
i
she
asked
aloud
clear
came
the
mental
answer
fantômas
has
shut
me
up
in
this
van
i
am
imprisoned
in
this
van
she
felt
about
her
with
her
fingers
she
was
certainly
sitting
on
rough
boards
she
knelt
she
stretched
out
her
arms
she
touched
rough
boards
yes
this
was
the
van
she
was
in
was
fantômas
quite
near
he
might
appear
again
she
was
not
saved
but
in
bobinette
who
terrified
at
being
confronted
with
fantômas
had
tasted
the
bitterness
of
death
a
powerful
reaction
had
set
in
she
was
becoming
mistress
of
herself
once
more
fantômas
had
said
to
her
thou
shalt
die
she
now
decided
that
she
would
live
would
save
herself
she
must
escape
if
fantômas
were
there
i
should
hear
him
she
thought
he
must
have
gone
i
must
at
all
costs
escape
from
this
prison
before
he
returns
bobinette
got
up
the
van
must
have
a
door
a
window
she
would
force
her
way
out
somehow
she
was
strong
and
she
was
fighting
for
her
life
she
would
make
a
tour
of
the
van
she
felt
her
way
by
fingering
the
wooden
side
of
her
prison
the
van
must
be
empty
she
thought
for
she
had
not
encountered
any
furniture
when
suddenly
she
felt
her
hand
come
into
contact
with
something
soft
and
warm
which
moved
what
was
it
bobinette
jumped
back
she
must
be
mad
to
imagine
she
waited
a
few
moments
she
stepped
forward
anew
her
fingers
touched
something
she
could
not
say
what
but
while
she
tried
to
define
the
strange
object
her
fingers
touched
she
felt
the
unknown
thing
was
drawing
back
was
avoiding
her
caress
the
van
was
now
filled
with
a
formidable
growling
she
recognised
it
as
a
repetition
of
the
sound
she
had
heard
when
nearing
her
sinister
rendezvous
bobinette
understood
she
knew
it
was
a
bear
it
had
been
asleep
she
had
waked
it
fantômas
had
shut
her
in
with
a
bear
she
was
to
be
devoured
alive
bobinette
softly
withdrew
to
the
other
side
of
the
van
she
waited
no
growling
sound
reached
her
the
bear
must
have
gone
to
sleep
again
she
could
hear
its
heavy
breathing
as
the
air
became
exhausted
in
the
confined
space
the
noisome
odour
of
the
beast
caught
her
by
the
throat
what
was
she
to
do
bobinette
asked
herself
this
again
and
again
as
the
slow
and
dreadful
hours
of
that
night
wore
on
the
bear
sleeps
she
said
to
herself
but
he
will
wake
in
the
morning
hungry
he
will
hurl
himself
on
me
and
i
shall
be
done
for
after
interminable
hours
of
waiting
of
aching
immobility
of
dull
agony
of
mind
the
interior
of
the
van
was
becoming
slowly
visible
she
had
listened
to
the
lessening
fury
of
the
wind
the
rain
had
ceased
the
wan
light
of
early
day
came
through
the
cracks
in
the
planking
bobinette
could
see
the
bear
waking
up
it
turned
yawned
suddenly
it
fixed
its
eyes
on
her
and
crouched
what
should
she
do
what
could
she
do
bobinette
had
once
read
that
the
human
eye
could
frighten
a
wild
beast
into
submission
she
forced
herself
to
stare
at
the
animal
with
concentrated
energy
alas
she
was
too
frightened
herself
to
terrify
a
ferocious
animal
into
harmless
submission
the
bear
licked
itself
as
though
sure
of
its
prey
which
he
would
presently
fall
upon
and
rend
he
took
his
time
and
proceeded
to
make
his
toilette
it
was
grotesquely
tragic
the
leisurely
tranquillity
of
this
beast
face
to
face
with
this
girl
who
could
count
the
seconds
of
life
remaining
to
her
now
and
again
bobinette
could
hear
the
rapid
passings
of
on
the
high
road
outside
speeding
to
paris
or
versailles
passing
the
van
abandoned
left
derelict
by
the
wayside
far
indeed
were
these
passers
from
suspecting
the
terrible
drama
of
which
it
was
the
theatre
call
out
that
were
madness
her
cries
might
pass
unheeded
why
should
she
suppose
the
drivers
of
these
cars
racing
on
their
appointed
way
would
stop
locate
the
cry
and
succour
her
no
it
would
but
excite
the
anger
of
the
bear
rouse
it
to
action
thus
hasten
her
own
dreadful
end
a
man
was
walking
on
the
sceaux
road
walking
fast
he
wore
the
clothes
of
a
working
man
he
was
leading
a
sorry
nag
the
man
halted
and
let
the
nag
go
free
a
sound
had
caught
his
ear
a
growling
sound
he
listened
intently
did
i
imagine
it
he
murmured
again
that
growling
punctuated
by
a
woman
sharp
scream
the
man
was
off
at
racing
speed
towards
the
van
which
was
but
a
hundred
yards
away
great
heaven
shall
i
arrive
too
late
ejaculated
the
man
reaching
it
breathless
he
glued
his
ear
to
the
door
the
van
shook
with
the
movement
and
growling
of
some
beast
of
prey
about
to
spring
the
man
drew
back
rushed
forward
hurled
himself
against
the
door
and
drove
it
inwards
a
shot
broke
the
silence
of
the
morning
the
man
rolled
over
the
body
of
the
bear
shot
dead
through
the
heart
the
man
freed
himself
escaped
the
convulsive
movement
of
its
limbs
and
crawled
towards
a
crumpled
heap
huddled
in
a
corner
of
this
tragic
stage
bobinette
poor
face
exposed
to
view
was
slashed
and
torn
it
bore
the
dreadful
of
the
bear
the
man
placed
his
hand
on
her
heart
she
lives
he
said
softly
supporting
her
with
infinite
gentleness
the
man
addressed
her
in
a
voice
trembling
with
emotion
do
not
be
afraid

are
saved

in
the
cell
which
had
served
him
as
for
the
past
fortnight
jérôme
fandor
had
had
his
ups
and
downs
hours
of
deepest
depression
hours
of
violent
exasperation
when
he
suffered
an
intolerable
martyrdom
between
his
four
walls
suffered
morally
and
physically
yet
his
imprisonment
had
been
rendered
as
tolerable
as
possible
he
could
have
his
meals
brought
in
from
outside
and
obtain
from
the
library
such
books
as
there
were
how
he
longed
for
a
talk
with
juve
but
that
detective
was
rigorously
excluded
from
the
prison
juve
was
to
be
a
witness
at
the
trial
as
fandor
was
to
conduct
his
own
case
there
were
no
consultations
with
his
counsel
to
relieve
the
monotony
of
the
days
nor
were
newspapers
allowed
him
he
had
no
friends
or
relatives
to
visit
and
console
him
or
divert
him
in
his
sleepless
hours
fandor
thoughts
would
revert
to
his
past
to
the
frightful
drama
of
his
boyhood
to
the
assassination
of
the
marquise
de
langrune
when
he
a
youth
of
eighteen
had
been
suspected
had
even
been
accused
of
committing
this
murder
the
accuser
being
his
own
father
footnote
see
vol
i
fantômas
series
he
remembered
that
commencing
the
very
day
after
the
discovery
of
the
crime
his
existence
had
been
that
of
a
pariah
flying
from
the
police
from
those
who
knew
him
remembered
how
he
had
assumed
disguise
after
disguise
denied
by
his
father
ignored
by
his
mother
an
unfortunate
woman
who
had
lost
her
reason
and
was
shut
up
in
a
lunatic
asylum
the
only
gleam
of
happiness
which
had
come
to
illumine
the
dreary
darkness
of
his
youth
resolved
itself
into
a
memory
picture
of
a
pale
dawn
when
the
lad
charles
rambert
leaving
a
had
been
caught
by
juve
who
believing
in
his
innocence
had
taken
him
under
his
protection
had
given
him
the
name
of
jérôme
fandor
and
helped
him
to
start
a
new
life
footnote
see
exploits
of
vol
ii
fantômas
series
from
then
onwards
that
timid
lad
disheartened
by
his
misfortunes
had
regained
courage
and
hope
and
had
boldly
plunged
into
the
struggle
to
live
his
heart
and
soul
were
in
his
journalistic
work
of
an
enquiring
turn
of
mind
fandor
had
not
been
content
with
the
episodic
work
of
a
mere
reporter
he
eagerly
pursued
the
guilty
took
a
lively
interest
in
the
victims
and
became
juve
valuable
collaborator
with
whom
the
bonds
of
friendship
strengthened
day
by
day
thus
fandor
in
juve
company
was
drawn
into
the
into
the
troubles
and
torments
of
criminal
affairs
so
mysterious
so
phenomenal
that
for
several
years
in
succession
they
created
a
sensation
not
only
in
paris
but
throughout
france
he
constituted
himself
one
of
the
most
implacable
enemies
of
fantômas
the
more
so
because
he
was
satisfied
that
the
genius
of
crime
as
this
monster
had
been
called
had
had
a
considerable
share
in
the
vicissitudes
and
troubles
of
his
own
life
fandor
felt
that
this
monster
sinister
influence
was
still
being
exercised
against
him
too
often
in
those
wakeful
hours
when
he
reviewed
his
life
following
the
course
of
it
in
a
kind
of
mental
cinematograph
did
fandor
think
of
elizabeth
dollon
it
was
with
sad
yet
sweet
emotion
with
a
piercing
regret
but
with
an
unfailing
hope
that
he
saw
before
his
inner
vision
the
charming
the
adored
face
and
figure
of
elizabeth
dollon
for
whom
he
had
felt
and
felt
still
an
affection
profound
and
sincere
he
loved
her
he
would
always
love
her
footnote
see
of

he
thought
of

and
the
extraordinary
disappearance
of
his
body
of
his
own
pursuit
of
the
assassin
of
the
discovery
made
with
juve
that
the
murderer
of
jacques

was
none
other
than
the
elusive
fantômas
assuredly
that
bandit
was
responsible
for
the
sudden
departure
of
elizabeth
immediately
after
fandor
had
obtained
from
her
charming
lips
the
sweet
avowal
of
her
love
he
owed
to
fantômas
that
he
had
been
unable
to
join
his
life

that
of
this
exquisite
girl

owed
it
that
he
could
not
trace
her
to
her
unknown
retreat
was
she
still
in
the
land
of
the
living
it
was
ultimately
to
fantômas
that
he
owed
his
present
dreadful
position
to
this
thrice
accursed
genius
of
crime
fantômas
that
evening
fandor
absorbing
reflections
were
broken
into
by
the
turning
of
a
key
in
the
lock
of
his
cell
at
an
unusual
hour
through
the
door
he
heard
the
close
of
a
conversation
between
his
jailor
and
an
unknown
person
i
also
give
notice
my
good
fellow
that
my
secretary
will
come
to
join
me
presently
said
the
strange
voice
the
jailor
replied
that
is
quite
understood
maître
i
will
warn
my
colleague
who
will
come
on
guard
in
my
stead
in
ten
minutes
time
fandor
saw
a
barrister
entering
his
cell
he
supposed
him
to
be
the
official
advocate
prescribed
by
the
council
of
war
not
in
the
least
disposed
to
unbosom
himself
to
this
defending
counsel
imposed
on
him
by
law
fandor
was
about
to
give
him
a
freezing
reception
but
at
sight
of
the
new
arrival
face
our
journalist
stood
speechless
he
recognised
under
the
barrister
gown
someone
whose
features
were
deeply
graven
on
his
memory
though
he
had
not
met
him
but
once
escaped
his
lips
a
brusque
warning
movement
of
the
cut
fandor
short
at
the
same
time
he
closed
the
door
with
a
lightning
quick
movement
the
pseudo
advocate
then
approached
fandor
saying
in
a
low
tone
do
not
seem
to
recognise
me
yes
i
am
de
naarboveck
it
is
thanks
to
a
subterfuge
that
i
have
been
able
to
get
near
fandor
was
nonplussed
a
hundred
questions
rose
to
his
lips
but
he
did
not
speak
he
had
better
await
developments
as
de
naarboveck
had
run
such
risks
to
enter
his
cell
so
disguised
he
must
have
something
extraordinary
to
say
to
the
prisoner
jérôme
fandor
de
naarboveck
seated
himself
on
the
one
bench
the
cell
contained
he
invited
fandor
to
sit
close
to
him
so
that
they
might
converse
in
low
tones
monsieur
began
the
baron
i
obtained
a
permit
to
visit
you
as
the
official
advocate
allotted
to
you
by
the
president
that
visit
is
due
well
a
favour
is
never
lost
when
one
is
not
dealing
with
the
ungrateful
some
weeks
ago
when
you
came
to
interview
me
with
regard
to
the
deplorable
assassination
of
captain
brocq
i
spoke
freely
to
you
and
at
the
same
time
asked
you
to
give
me
your
word
not
to
put
into
print
a
number
of
those
personal
details
with
which
journalists
like
to
sprinkle
their
i
remember
agreed
fandor
i
confess
i
did
not
put
much
faith
in
your
discretion
being
a
journalist
went
on
the
baron
i
was
then
agreeably
surprised
to
find
that
i
had
been
interviewed
by
a
man
of
tact
since
then
i
have
followed
with
sympathy
the
tenebrous
adventures
in
which
you
have
been
involved
it
was
not
without
emotion
that
i
learned
of
the
grievous
position
you
are
now
in
i
will
come
straight
to
the
point
i
am
here
to
extricate
you
from
that
position
fandor
caught
de
naarboveck
hands
in
his
and
pressed
them
warmly
can
what
you
tell
me
be
true
he
exclaimed
the
diplomat
hastily
withdrew
his
hands
from
fandor
grasp
opened
a
heavy
portfolio
such
as
advocates
carry
and
drew
from
it
a
black
gown
like
his
own
an
advocate
cap
and
a
pair
of
dark
coloured
trousers
put
these
on
as
quickly
as
possible
said
de
naarboveck
and
we
will
leave
here
together
fandor
hesitated
de
naarboveck
insisted
it
is
of
the
first
importance
that
you
leave
here
i
know
where
proofs
of
your
innocence
are
to
be
found
we
have
not
a
minute
to
lose
besides
as
a
member
of
the
diplomatic
service
it
is
of
the
utmost
interest
to
me
that
the
document
stolen
from
captain
brocq
should
be
recovered
i
know
where
it
is
i
want
you
to
return
it
to
the
government
that
will
be
the
most
striking
proof
possible
of
your
innocence
fandor
critical
faculties
were
momentarily
suspended
he
seemed
moving
in
some
dream
mechanically
he
clothed
himself
in
the
which
the
baron
had
thought
good
to
bring
him
fandor
had
seen
so
many
extraordinary
things
in
the
course
of
his
adventurous
existence
that
he
did
not
stay
to
question
the
reason
for
this
diplomat
interest
in
his
poor
affairs
an
interest
so
strong
that
he
had
run
serious
risks
to
reach
the
prisoner
and
make
himself
the
accomplice
of
that
prisoner
flight
out
of
prison
free
fandor
could
and
would
act
the
two
apparent
men
of
the
law
gently
opened
the
cell
door
de
naarboveck
cast
a
rapid
glance
up
and
down
the
corridor
on
to
which
half
a
dozen
cells
opened
the
corridor
was
empty
and
silent
de
naarboveck
and
fandor
stepped
out
gently
closing
the
cell
door
the
opening
of
the
prison
door
is
our
next
difficulty
to
be
overcome
whispered
de
naarboveck
i
warned
the
jailor
that
i
expected
my
secretary
let
us
hope
he
will
take
you
as
such
and
let
us
pass
out
unmolested
the
military
prison
of
the
council
of
war
of
paris
is
not
like
other
prisons
that
is
why
de
naarboveck
plan
had
a
fair
chance
of
success
it
would
certainly
have
failed
had
it
been
attempted
at
la
santé
or
at
la
roquette
this
building
had
been
a
private
hotel
of
the
old
style
on
the
first
floor
the
former
had
been
divided
into
small
offices
and
the
principal
had
been
transformed
into
a
on
the
ground
floor
what
were
evidently
the
kitchens
and
domestic
offices
in
the
last
century
now
constituted
the
prison
proper
for
in
these
quarters
are
arranged
the
cells
where
the
accused
await
their
appearance
before
their
judges
no
one
unacquainted
with
these
arrangements
would
suspect
that
the
low
door
scarcely
noticeable
in
the
vestibule
facing
the
staircase
leading
to
the
first
floor
is
the
entrance
to
the
prison
yet
those
who
pass
through
this
low
door
find
themselves
in
the
corridor
lined
with
prison
cells
at
the
door
of
the
prison
a
warder
is
posted
whose
rôle
is
not
so
much
to
watch
the
prisoners
and
prevent
any
attempt
at
escape
as
to
open
to
persons
needing
to
enter
that
place
at
supervision
is
relaxed
the
warder
has
to
keep
the
offices
in
good
order
and
when
he
has
his
key
in
his
pocket
certain
that
the
heavy
bolts
and
locks
can
not
be
forced
he
comes
and
goes
about
the
house
de
naarboveck
was
not
only
well
posted
in
these
details
but
was
aware
that
up
to
the
day
of
fandor
trial
in
view
of
the
extra
coming
and
going
it
had
been
decided
to
give
the
guardian
an
assistant
and
that
this
assistant
would
be
at
his
post
from
six
onwards
it
was
past
six
the
chances
were
that
when
the
false
advocates
knocked
from
the
inside
the
prison
door
would
be
opened
to
allow
them
egress
by
the
supplementary
guardian
de
naarboveck
tapped
on
the
peephole
made
in
the
massive
door
the
noise
of
heavy
bolts
withdrawn
was
heard
the
prison
door
was
half
opened
the
warder
face
appeared
fandor
stifled
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
it
was
a
jailor
who
did
not
know
him
it
was
the
substitute
counted
upon
ah
cried
he
saluting
the
gentlemen
of
the
long
robe
why
there
are
two
of
you
naturally
replied
de
naarboveck
did
not
your
colleague
let
you
know
that
my
secretary
had
joined
me
i
knew
he
was
coming
but
i
did
not
understand
that
he
had
already
come
replied
the
man
de
naarboveck
laughed
we
leave
together
what
more
natural
it
is
your
right
grumbled
the
man
have
you
finished
your
interrogation
of
the
accused
fandor
as
he
asked
this
pertinent
question
the
jailor
made
a
movement
to
enter
the
prison
and
make
sure
that
the
prisoner
cell
was
locked
de
naarboveck
caught
his
arm
look
here
my
man
said
he
slipping
a
silver
coin
into
the
hand
we
are
not
suitably
dressed
for
the
street
and
our
ordinary
clothes
are
at
the
palais
de
justice
will
you
be
kind
enough
to
stop
a
cab
for
us
we
can
get
into
it
at
the
courtyard
entrance
the
jailor
decided
that
he
could
safely
postpone
his
visit
to
cell
he
went
out
into
the
courtyard
with
the
two
apparent
advocates
standing
on
the
step
of
the
courtyard
gate
he
looked
out
for
a
passing
cab
a
scented
customers
he
drove
alongside
the
pavement
in
a
moment
de
naarboveck
and
fandor
were
seated
inside
it
and
whilst
waving
his
hand
to
the
respectful
and
gratified
warder
he
instructed
the
driver
in
a
clear
voice
to
the
palais
de
justice
as
soon
as
they
reached
the
rue
de
rennes
de
naarboveck
changed
his
destination
he
turned
to
fandor
well
monsieur
fandor
what
have
you
to
say
to
this
ah
baron
how
can
i
ever
express
my
gratitude
de
naarboveck
smiled
he
gazed
at
the
journalist
there
was
something
in
the
situation
he
found
amusing
following
the
baron
directions
the
taxi
went
up
the
rue
lapic
and
reached
the
heights
of
montmartre
it
stopped
at
last
in
a
little
street
dark
and
deserted
before
a
house
whose
front
was
vaguely
outlined
in
a
small
neglected
garden
de
naarboveck
paid
the
driver
passed
under
a
dark
arch
crossed
the
garden
and
reached
a
kind
of
lodge
he
let
himself
in
followed
by
fandor
they
went
up
a
staircase
to
the
floor
above
de
naarboveck
switched
on
a
light
and
fandor
saw
that
he
and
his
rescuer
were
in
a
studio
of
vast
proportions
well
furnished
thick
curtains
hung
before
a
large
glass
bay
it
was
a
lofty
room
with
very
slightly
sloping
walls
two
or
three
rooms
must
have
been
thrown
into
one
for
several
thick
supporting
columns
of
iron
crossed
the
middle
of
the
studio
fandor
failed
to
find
either
piece
of
furniture
or
picture
he
could
recognise
everything
in
the
place
was
new
to
him
de
naarboveck
had
slipped
off
his
gown
at
once
he
was
in
elegant
evening
dress
fandor
also
threw
off
the
advocate
gown
he
wore
the
black
trousers
de
naarboveck
had
brought
him
but
was
in
his
shirt
sleeves
the
vinson
uniform
had
been
left
in
the
cell
having
sufficiently
enjoyed
the
surprise
of
his
protégé
the
baron
asked
do
you
know
where
we
are
monsieur
fandor
i
have
not
the
remotest
idea
think
a
little
i
do
not
know
in
the
least
that
is
a
fact
monsieur
said
de
naarboveck
coming
close
to
fandor
as
though
he
was
afraid
of
being
overheard
you
know
at
least
by
name
a
certain
enigmatic
individual
who
plays
an
important
part
in
the
affairs
of
which
we
both
are
victims
in
different
ways
i
will
no
longer
hide
from
you
that
we
are
in
this
individual
house
and
gasped
fandor
this
individual
is
called
he
is
called
vagualame
vagualame
fandor
was
aghast
had
the
devil
himself
appeared
before
him
he
could
not
have
been
more
dumbfounded
vagualame
the
agent
of
the
second
bureau
vagualame
whom
fandor
for
some
time
past
had
taken
to
be
a
spy
with
more
than
one
string
to
his
bow
it
was
he
then
who
was
the
author
of
the
crimes
for
whom
search
was
being
made
in
whose
stead
fandor
himself
was
suffering
humiliation
and
imprisonment
with
further
dreadful
possibilities
to
come
fandor
recalled
his
conversation
with
juve
the
day
after
captain
brocq
assassination
in
the
course
of
their
conversation
juve
had
asserted
that
fantômas
was
the
criminal
fandor
himself
had
not
followed
the
mysterious
evolutions
of
this
sinister
accordion
player
as
had
juve
but
now
he
wondered
whether
there
might
not
be
a
connection
between
vagualame
and
fantômas
all
this
was
obscure
fandor
felt
he
was
groping
amid
dark
mysteries
de
naarboveck
was
moving
hither
and
thither
in
the
studio
at
the
same
time
he
was
observing
fandor
listening
to
what
he
had
to
say
he
seemed
to
be
reading
fandor
thoughts
your
friend
juve
has
been
hotly
pursuing
this
vagualame
for
some
time
remarked
de
naarboveck
famous
detective
as
he
is
he
has
suffered
more
than
one
check
has
been
routed
rebuffed
discomfited
on
several
occasions
by
this
same
vagualame
who
has
proved
that
he
is
not
such
a
fool
as
he
looks
possibly
juve
will
soon
have
a
further
opportunity
of
realising
the
truth
of
this
fandor
interrupted
i
hope
my
friend
my
dear
friend
juve
does
not
run
any
risk
i
beg
of
you
monsieur
to
tell
me
whether
he
is
in
danger
you
see
i
am
free
attention
monsieur
fandor
de
naarboveck
cut
in
bear
in
mind
that
you
are
an
escaped
prisoner
that
your
flight
must
not
be
known
be
on
your
guard
then
as
to
your
friend
juve
be
reassured
on
that
point
abruptly
he
changed
the
subject
vagualame
had
a
collaborator
a
young
person
whom
you
know
mademoiselle
berthe
called
bobinette
bobinette
has
done
wrong
very
wrong
but
we
will
speak
no
more
of
her
peace
to
her
memory
she
has
expiated
her
crime
is
bobinette
dead
then
asked
fandor
immediately
a
conviction
seized
him
that
the
girl
had
fallen
a
victim
to
this
mysterious
assassin
whom
no
one
could
lay
hands
on
the
studio
clock
struck
ten
the
lights
went
out
fandor
stood
startled
in
deepest
darkness
before
he
could
utter
an
exclamation
move
a
finger
he
was
swathed
in
a
cloth
seized
bound
with
the
utmost
brutality
mysterious
hands
fixed
a
supple
mask
on
his
face
pressed
something
on
his
head
dragged
violently
along
the
cords
cutting
his
flesh
fandor
realised
his
attackers
were
fastening
him
to
something
which
held
him
stiffly
upright
it
must
be
one
of
the
iron
columns
fandor
thought
he
heard
a
receding
voice
mutter
as
bobinette
died
so
shalt
thou
die
through
fantômas
had
he
heard
aright
was
it
some
illusion
of
sense
and
brain
was
it
not
he
himself
who
had
cried
it
for
fandor
whose
mind
had
been
full
of
vagualame
had
at
the
moment
of
attack
spontaneously
thought
of
fantômas
fandor
strained
at
his
bonds
and
thought
of
the
baron
naarboveck
to
me
help
he
shouted
no
answer
came
through
the
darkness
did
he
hear
a
distant
stifled
groan
dazzling
light
flooded
the
studio
fandor
who
could
see
through
the
eyeholes
of
the
mask
supple
as
skin
stared
about
him
with
intense
curiosity
this
extraordinary
studio
revealed
a
spectacle
facing
him
immobile
rigid
was
stationed
a
being
whom
fandor
had
had
a
fleeting
glimpse
of
two
or
three
times
in
his
life
he
had
seen
this
enigmatic
and
formidable
being
under
circumstances
so
tragic
on
occasions
so
phenomenal
that
this
being
outline
was
graven
on
his
memory
for
ever
there
was
the
cloak
of
many
folds
dense
black
the
hooded
mask
the
large
soft
hat
shading
the
eyes
the
strange
inimitable
outline
fandor
was
facing
fantômas
fantômas
with
bent
shoulders
and
straining
muscles
fandor
made
desperate
attempts
to
free
himself
the
while
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
terrifying
apparition
confronting
him
it
was
a
mocking
fantômas
he
saw
for
the
abominable
bandit
was
mocking
him
was
imitating
his
every
gesture
to
the
life
fandor
gaze
was
fixed
in
an
observing
stare
did
he
not
see
cords
binding
the
limbs
of
fantômas
cords
binding
him
about
the
middle
constricting
his
whole
body
was
he
in
some
hell
nightmare
was
he
mad
who
was
this
facing
him
why
fandor
whose
image
was
reflected
in
a
mirror
facing
him
a
yard
or
two
away
fandor
had
been
endowed
with
the
outline
of
fantômas
from
the
throat
of
this
issued
a
howl
of
rage
xxxiii
reconciliation
which
do
you
prefer
mademoiselle
the
cockades
or
the
bows
of
ribbon
in
one
shade
we
have
both
in
satin
of
the
best
quality
wilhelmine
de
naarboveck
hesitated
the
representative
from
the
ladies
paradise
continued
the
cockades
of
various
colours
do
very
well
they
are
gay
look
bright
but
the
bows
of
ribbon
also
produce
an
excellent
effect
so
distinguished
both
articles
are
in
great
demand
wilhelmine
answered
at
random
oh
put
in
half
of
each
and
what
quantity
mademoiselle
oh
three
hundred
will
be
sufficient
i
should
think
the
shopwoman
displayed
her
assortment
of
cotillion
objects
she
did
her
part
ably
but
wilhelmine
de
naarboveck
gave
but
a
perfunctory
attention
to
this
choosing
of
cotillion
accessories
the
saleswoman
was
more
and
more
astonished
she
considered
that
were
her
customer
orders
executed
to
the
letter
she
would
have
the
oddest
assortment
of
cotillion
accessories
that
could
be
imagined
she
adroitly
called
wilhelmine
attention
to
this
realising
that
she
had
been
giving
orders
at
random
the
girl
came
to
a
decision
we
have
every
confidence
in
your
house
being
able
to
supply
us
with
a
cotillion
complete
in
every
detail
you
know
better
than
i
what
is
necessary
i
will
leave
it
to
you
then
to
see
that
everything
is
done
as
well
as
possible
the
saleswoman
was
full
of
delighted
protestations
though
satisfied
with
a
decision
that
simplified
her
task
she
was
surprised
that
a
young
girl
as
free
to
act
and
order
as
mademoiselle
de
naarboveck
seemed
to
be
did
not
take
interest
in
the
details
of
a
fête
which
as
rumour
had
it
was
given
in
her
honour
ah
said
the
young
woman
as
she
collected
the
patterns
scattered
over
a
table
in
the
hall
if
all
our
customers
were
like
you
mademoiselle
and
allowed
us
to
carry
out
our
own
ideas
we
should
do
marvellous
things
wilhelmine
smiled
but
would
this
saleswoman
never
have
done
of
course
mademoiselle
we
make
similar
ribbons
for
you
and
your
partner
but
would
you
kindly
tell
me
if
the
gentleman
is
tall
or
short
it
is
better
to
make
the
ribbons
of
a
length
proportionate
to
the
height
this
question
troubled
wilhelmine
the
leader
of
the
cotillion
should
have
been
henri
de
loubersac
was
not
their
betrothal
to
have
been
announced
at
the
ball
but
the
painful
interview
at
seemed
to
have
put
an
end
to
all
relations
between
them
who
then
would
lead
with
her
little
she
cared
really
madame
replied
wilhelmine
to
the
woman
who
was
astonished
at
her
indifference
i
do
not
know
how
tall
or
short
my
partner
is
for
the
very
good
reason
that
i
do
not
know
who
he
is
provide
then
a
set
of
ribbons
which
may
suit
anybody
when
the
representative
of
the
ladies
paradise
had
taken
her
departure
wilhelmine
went
up
to
the
library
except
for
the
stiff
and
solemn
household
staff
wilhelmine
was
alone
in
the
house
her
father
was
still
absent
mademoiselle
berthe
had
vanished
the
house
was
turned
upside
down
from
top
to
bottom
decorators
and
electricians
were
in
possession
hammering
had
been
going
on
all
the
afternoon
furniture
had
been
displaced
pushed
hither
and
thither
the
hall
had
been
denuded
of
all
but
the
table
even
the
privacy
of
the
library
had
been
invaded
and
all
in
preparation
for
the
ball
of
the
day
after
to
which
the
baron
de
naarboveck
had
invited
the
highest
personages
of
the
aristocratic
and
official
worlds
what
a
lively
interest
wilhelmine
had
at
first
taken
in
this
fête
the
baron
was
giving
it
to
set
a
public
seal
on
his
diplomatic
position
for
hitherto
he
had
not
been
definitely
attached
to
his
embassy
now
he
was
to
be
the
accredited
ambassador
of
a
certain
foreign
power
also
he
intended
to
announce
the
betrothal
of
the
young
couple
alas
this
latter
project
had
suffered
shipwreck
as
wilhelmine
sat
in
lonely
state
in
the
library
she
saw
a
dismal
future
opening
before
her
not
only
had
her
heart
been
torn
by
the
brusque
rupture
with
henri
de
loubersac
but
everything
which
made
up
her
home
life
such
as
it
was
seemed
falling
to
pieces
no
doubt
the
diplomat
was
obliged
to
be
continually
absent
but
wilhelmine
suffered
from
this
solitude
this
abandonment
she
had
become
attached
to
the
gay
and
companionable
mademoiselle
berthe
who
had
been
the
life
and
soul
of
the
house
she
had
disappeared
no
tidings
of
her
doings
or
whereabouts
had
reached
wilhelmine
there
must
be
some
very
serious
reason
for
this
the
mysterious
occurrences
of
the
past
weeks
had
altered
her
world
shaken
it
to
its
insecure
foundations
and
inevitably
affected
her
outlook
life
seemed
a
melancholy
thing
how
gloomy
how
helpless
her
outlook
more
than
ever
before
she
felt
in
every
fibre
of
her
being
that
she
was
not
the
daughter
of
the
baron
de
naarboveck
that
she
was
indeed
thérèse
auvernois
but
what
a
fatal
destiny
must
be
hers
an
existence
open
to
the
attacks
of
misfortune
at
the
mercy
of
a
being
enigmatic
indefatigable
who
time
and
again
had
thrown
his
horrible
influence
across
her
destiny
was
throwing
it
now
the
sinister
fantômas
wilhelmine
was
torn
from
her
miserable
reflections
by
the
irruption
of
a
domestic
who
announced
monsieur
de
loubersac
is
asking
if
mademoiselle
can
receive
him
wilhelmine
rose
from
the
divan
on
which
she
had
been
reclining
in
an
expressionless
voice
she
said
show
him
in
when
the
young
officer
of
cuirassiers
appeared
his
air
was
embarrassed
his
head
was
bent
you
here
monsieur
wilhelmine
voice
and
manner
expressed
indignation
but
henri
de
loubersac
was
no
longer
the
arrogant
unbeliever
of
the
interview
excuse
me
he
murmured
what
do
you
want
demanded
wilhelmine
her
head
held
high
your
forgiveness
he
said
in
a
voice
barely
audible
de
loubersac
had
come
to
his
senses
his
intense
jealousy
had
distorted
his
judgment
desperate
after
the
interview
when
so
it
had
seemed
to
him
wilhelmine
had
avoided
a
categorical
denial
of
his
accusation
regarding
her
liaison
with
captain
brocq
the
frantic
lover
had
flown
to
juve
and
had
poured
out
his
soul
to
the
sympathetic
detective
juve
had
shown
himself
no
sceptic
he
believed
wilhelmine
story
and
statements
they
coincided
with
his
own
prognostications
they
explained
why
wilhelmine
went
regularly
to
pray
at
lady
tomb
they
corroborated
his
conjectures
they
confirmed
his
forecasts
if
he
did
not
confess
it
to
de
loubersac
he
knew
in
his
own
mind
that
these
statements
indicated
that
between
this
baron
de
naarboveck
and
the
redoubtable
bandit
he
was
pursuing
so
determinedly
there
was
some
connection
possibly
as
yet
unfathomed
but
in
his
heart
of
hearts
he
believed
he
had
lighted
on
the
truth
his
conviction
that
de
naarboveck
and
fantômas
had
relations
of
some
sort
dated
from
the
night
of
his
own
arrest
as
vagualame
in
the
house
of
de
naarboveck
he
had
gone
further
than
that
yes
he
had
said
to
himself
de
naarboveck
must
be
a
manifestation
of
fantômas
corporal
vinson
revelations
regarding
the
den
in
the
rue
monge
had
but
strengthened
juve
impression
he
had
said
to
himself
after
that
de
naarboveck
vagualame
fantômas
are
but
one
juve
had
reassured
de
loubersac
he
declared
that
wilhelmine
had
spoken
the
truth
that
she
certainly
was
thérèse
auvernois
and
the
most
honest
girl
in
the
world
juve
calmed
and
finally
convinced
de
loubersac
it
only
remained
for
the
repentant
lover
to
reinstate
himself
in
wilhelmine
good
graces
if
that
were
possible
now
more
ardently
than
ever
before
he
desired
to
make
wilhelmine
his
wife
see
her
be
reconciled
to
her
he
must
he
arrived
at
a
favourable
moment
the
poor
girl
lonely
and
alone
was
a
prey
to
the
most
gloomy
forebodings
life
had
lost
all
its
savour
she
was
in
the
depths
of
despair
de
loubersac
standing
before
her
as
at
a
judgment
bar
again
implored
her
forgiveness
oh
how
i
regret
the
brutal
wounding
things
i
said
to
you
wilhelmine
he
murmured
humbly
sorrowfully
the
innocent
girl
so
bitterly
wronged
by
his
thoughts
and
words
crimsoned
with
indignation
at
the
memory
of
them
her
tone
was
icy
i
may
be
able
to
forgive
you
monsieur
but
that
is
all
you
can
hope
for
will
you
never
be
able
to
love
me
again
begged
henri
with
the
humble
simplicity
of
a
boy
no

was
hard
it
was
all
henri
could
do
not
to
burst
into
tears
of
humiliation
and
despair
wilhelmine
you
are
cruel
if
you
could
only
know
how
you
are
making
me
suffer
oh
i
know
i
deserve
to
suffer
i
recognise
that
all
i
can
say
now
is
farewell

hidden
in

at
the
head
of
my
troops
with
that
de
loubersac
moved
slowly
to
the
door
overwhelmed
by
the
conviction
that
he
had
irreparably
wounded
the
girl
he
adored
that
he
had
destroyed
for
ever
the
love
she
had
borne
him
a
stifled
cry
caught
his
ear
henri
wilhelmine
they
were
in
each
others
arms
and
in
tears
how
the
lovers
talked
what
plans
they
made
how
happy
would
be
their
coming
life
together
what
bliss
wilhelmine
broke
off
henri

xxxiv
a
fantômas
trick
fandor
stared
at
himself
with
wild
eyes
he
must
be
in
an
abominable
dream
a
mad
nightmare
he
must
be
what
was
behind
all
this
this
outrage
this
vagualame
criminal
proprietor
of
this
pavilion
was
the
author
of
it
to
him
he
owed
it
that
he
was
thus
bound
masked
disguised
that
sinister
menace
was
still
ringing
in
his
ears
through
fantômas
thou
shalt
die
well
however
it
might
come
death
came
but
once
he
would
await
the
event
fandor
spirit
rose
once
more
indomitable
he
closed
his
eyes
he
lived
again
as
might
a
drowning
man
his
hours
of
joy
of
struggle
of
triumph
of
defeat
of
high
endeavour
all
the
hours
of
vivid
life
ah
how
fantômas
had
haunted
him
from
childhood
onwards
is
but
life
logic
he
reflected
i
have
fought
fantômas
and
not
always
has
the
victory
been
wholly
his
more
than
once
i
have
called
check
to
him
it
is
his
turn
to
take
revenge
with
the
irrevocable
checkmate
well
i
have
lost
i
pay
the
heavy
silence
of
the
studio
was
loud
with
menace
surrounded
by
it
he
awaited
death
coming
in
whatever
guise
the
studio
door
swung
open
noiselessly
some
twenty
men
appeared
all
clothed
in
black
and
masked
in
velvet
their
approach
over
the
thickly
carpeted
floor
was
soundless
fandor
stared
at
these
strange
figures
solemnly
silently
they
ranged
themselves
in
a
half
circle
facing
fandor
he
who
was
plainly
the
chief
of
them
remained
apart
arms
crossed
head
high
considering
fandor
he
spoke
brothers
you
have
sworn
to
defend
russia
to
defend
poland
by
every
means
in
your
power
do
you
swear
it
still
the
voices
of
the
masked
men
vibrated
as
one
we
swear
it
brothers
are
you
prepared
to
risk
all
for
our
cause
we
are
prepared
the
man
who
posed
as
chief
came
nearer
his
who
bent
their
heads
as
he
apostrophised
them
brothers
there
is
a
man
in
paris
who
has
worked
more
harm
to
us
than
have
all
the
police
in
the
world
a
man
who
has
stirred
up
against
us
the
indignant
horror
of
public
opinion
by
an
accumulation
of
hideous
crimes
the
responsibility
for
which
he
has
cast
on
us
this
man
i
trokoff
have
vowed
to
deliver
up
to
you
that
you
may
wreak
your
vengeance
on
him
look
well
brothers
he
is
before
you
i
deliver
him
up
to
you
the
conspirators
as
one
man
stared
at
fandor
a
murmur
issued
from
the
mouths
of
these
masked
men
a
murmur
breathing
hate
and
menaces
fantômas
fantômas
fandor
did
not
lose
one
detail
of
this
scene
ah
thought
he
the
bandit
last
trick
trokoff
was
fantômas
fandor
was
sure
of
it
he
was
abusing
the
ardent
faith
and
trust
of
his
disciples
this
false
apostle
wishing
to
rid
himself
of
fandor
he
delivered
him
to
the
vengeance
of
his
companions
making
him
pass
for
fantômas
he
drove
them
on
to
murder
thus
thrusting
on
to
them
responsibility
for
the
crime
leaving
them
to
reap
what
consequences
might
follow
from
the
assassination
how
fandor
longed
to
shout
i
am
not
fantômas
your
trokoff
is
a
traitor
but
how
pull
the
scales
from
off
eyes
blinded
by
fanaticism
how
to
prove
to
them
he
was
not
fantômas
who
among
them
could
recognise
the
unknown
elusive
bandit
fantômas
these
nihilists
had
for
trokoff
an
admiration
beyond
the
bounds
of
reason
how
could
he
show
up
trokoff
as
he
really
was
it
would
be
madness
to
attempt
it
for
fandor
divined
that
behind
the
mask
of
trokoff
lurked
the
evil
countenance
of
fantômas
fantômas
who
was
gloating
over
his
confusion
and
despair
rejoicing
in
his
agony
counting
on
his
collapse
hoping
for
some
act
of
cowardice
never
would
jérôme
fandor
play
the
coward
at
this
stake
to
which
they
had
bound
him
he
would
die
without
a
sound
fandor
drove
back
from
his
lips
the
cry
of
despair
they
were
about
to
utter
he
awaited
the
event
a
nihilist
broke
from
the
circle
went
up
to
fandor
fantômas
you
have
heard
you
are
about
to
die
what
have
you
to
say
in
your
defence
fandor
was
dumb
fantômas
you
would
die
unknown
but
it
is
good
that
we
having
gazed
on
your
face
should
be
appeased
when
we
see
you
dead
your
hood
and
mask
i
tear
them
off
you
trokoff
rushed
forward
crying
do
not
lay
hands
on
him
this
wretch
belongs
to
me
turning
to
his
trokoff
demanded
my
hand
should
strike
the
fatal
blow
i
brought
him
here
the
right
is
mine
trokoff
continued
in
a
quieter
tone
the
police
may
have
been
warned
of
our
gathering
here
we
are
spied
on
tracked
you
know
it
well
suppose
we
stay
to
watch
the
dying
agony
of
this
wretch
suppose
the
police
descend
upon
us
they
will
snatch
from
us
our
just
revenge
and
will
arrest
us
all
hand
over
this
monster
to
me
and
leave
the
place
if
the
police
are
watching
you
they
will
see
you
go
leave
fantômas
to
me
that
at
my
leisure
i
may
see
him
die
as
he
deserves
to
die
fandor
shuddered
so
a
lingering
agony
a
fearful
death
was
to
be
faced
yes
fantômas
meant
to
torture
him
extract
from
his
victim
some
appeal
for
pity
for
the
mercy
this
monster
in
human
form
could
never
know
nor
exercise
yes
fantômas
had
changed
his
plans
rid
of
the
nihilists
he
could
have
it
all
his
own
way
with
fandor
the
disciples
as
with
one
voice
cried
we
are
thy
faithful
followers
what
thou
ordainest
that
we
do
trokoff
turned
to
fandor
he
shook
a
threatening
fist
in
face
collect
yourself
you
are
to
pay
the
price
of
expiation
soon
this
menace
hurled
at
his
victim
trokoff
drew
his
fanatical
partisans
together
made
them
quit
the
studio
and
vanished
with
them
he
will
return
thought
fandor
and
then
it
is
all
up
with
me
courage
to
face
the
worst
the
door
of
the
studio
had
barely
closed
on
trokoff
and
his
dupes
when
fandor
heard
a
breathless
murmur
at
his
ear
quick
quick
fandor
trokoff
you
have
guessed
it
is
vagualame
is
fantômas
cost
what
it
may
we
must
get
the
mastery
of
him
fandor
could
not
turn
his
head
but
he
felt
his
bonds
were
being
loosened
a
minute
or
two
and
he
was
free
he
took
a
staggering
step
or
two
his
limbs
were
stiff
and
numb
close
to
him
watching
his
first
difficult
movements
with
an
expression
of
ardent
sympathy
our
journalist
perceived
naarboveck
you
said
he
i
fandor
i
will
explain
hold
here
is
a
revolver
ah
the
bandits
they
took
me
too
me
also
they
have
condemned
to
death
but
i
managed
to
escape
look
out
he
returns
we
will
fall
upon
trokoff
we
will
avenge
ourselves
a
heavy
step
was
heard
on
the
stairs
someone
was
mounting
hurriedly
trokoff
was
about
to
reappear
fandor
grasped
the
revolver
de
naarboveck
had
just
handed
to
him
he
bounded
to
the
door
ready
to
leap
on
the
entering
man
de
naarboveck
was
ambushed
on
the
side
opposite
to
fandor
suddenly
fandor
shouted
do
not
kill
him
if
it
is
fantômas
we
must
take
him
alive
before
de
naarboveck
had
time
to
reply
the
door
was
flung
back
against
him
thus
putting
him
out
of
action
for
the
moment
fandor
shot
forward
seized
trokoff
by
the
throat
and
rolling
on
the
floor
with
him
yelled
to
me
naarboveck
fantômas
you
are
taken
yield
fandor
grip
and
spring
had
been
so
sudden
that
trokoff
had
not
been
able
to
defend
himself
he
and
fandor
struggled
twisted
writhed
in
a
terrible
embrace
panting
livid
with
eyes
of
hate
and
horror
de
naarboveck
had
laid
hold
of
trokoff
shouting
you
shall
die
you
must
die
this
frightful
struggle
lasted
but
a
few
moments
trokoff
managed
to
free
himself
from
fandor
grip
the
stupefied
journalist
heard
a
familiar
voice
crying
look
out
fandor
it
is
naarboveck
we
must
take
go
it
go
it
the
studio
was
plunged
in
darkness
a
door
banged
fandor
staggered
driven
violently
back
into
the
middle
of
the
studio
he
felt
a
man
was
rushing
away
he
escapes
he
escapes
fandor
did
not
know
who
had
remained
with
him
who
had
fled
whether
he
was
on
his
head
or
his
heels
it
was
a
momentary
bewilderment
for
the
voice
he
had
heard
when
the
struggle
was
at
its
height
was
still
speaking
calm
mocking
it
was
the
voice
of
juve
saying
how
exasperating
these
matches
are
no
good
at
all
ah
this
one
has
decided
to
catch
in
the
uncertain
light
of
the
match
flame
fandor
perceived
someone
leaning
against
the
wall
it
was
trokoff
trokoff
who
calmly
went
up
to
a
table
took
a
candlestick
and
lighted
a
candle
throwing
himself
into
an
this
trokoff
asked
well
now
why
the
devil
are
you
got
up
as
fantômas
my
lad
for
a
military
prisoner
this
is
not
at
all
correct
could
fandor
believe
his
ears
his
eyes
trokoff
was
juve
fandor
looked
so
bewildered
that
laughed
a
merry
laugh
come
now
my
fandor
try
to
gather
your
wandering
wits
together
a
bit
and
answer
me
you
juve
you
are
juve
gasped
fandor
exhausted
in
mind
and
body
with
the
emotions
he
had
experienced
so
it
happens
replied
juve
well
i
see
i
must
speak
first
as
you
do
not
seem
to
be
in
a
condition
to
talk
listen
then
i
know
these
nihilists
who
imagine
i
am
their
chief
trokoff
that
is
my
latest
transformation
i
learned
this
evening
that
these
imbeciles
believing
they
had
got
hold
of
fantômas
were
summoned
here
to
pass
judgment
on
the
bandit
i
accompanied
them
as
trokoff
who
had
called
them
together
when
we
entered
i
can
assure
you
that
bound
to
your
pillar
you
made
a
striking
figure
of
fantômas
you
took
in
even
me
for
a
while
luckily
i
noticed
your
hands
the
only
portions
of
you
visible
covered
as
you
were
in
that
confounded
hooded
thing
they
muffled
you
up
in
you
must
know
that
the
pattern
of
the
veins
on
the
hands
is
absolutely
characteristic
and
individual
so
much
so
that
the
anthropometric
service
in
vienna
is
entirely
based
on
this
principle
that
is
how
i
recognized
you
my
little
fandor
you
can
imagine
that
my
one
idea
then
was
to
get
rid
of
the
nihilists
as
soon
as
possible
and
liberate
you
but
by
jove
when
i
returned
you
and
naarboveck
between
you
attacked
me
so
brutally
that
you
nearly
did
for
me
it
was
a
narrow
shave
he
was
throttling
me
had
you
fired
your
revolver
at
me
you
would
almost
certainly
have
killed
me
and
then
you
would
have
fallen
a
victim
yourself
juve
stopped
he
questioned
fandor
with
a
look
de
naarboveck
de
naarboveck
who
is
fantômas
replied
fandor
who
now
understood
the
situation
juve
crossed
his
arms
it
is
as
you
say
vagualame
naarboveck
fantômas
are
one
and
the
same
and
be
sure
of
this
we
have
not
set
eyes
on
the
real
face
of
fantômas
yet
for
de
naarboveck
is
as
much
made
up
for
the
part
as
he
is
when
playing
vagualame
juve
juve
interrupted
fandor
we
are
mad
to
stay
talking
like
this
naarboveck
has
just
vanished
he
is
certain
to
go
to
his
place
even
if
feeling
he
is
unmasked
he
has
decided
to
disappear
forever
do
not
let
him
escape
juve
for
heaven
sake
hurry
juve
did
not
stir
how
very
violent
you
are
and
how
simple
my
little
fandor
look
now
it
is
quite
three
minutes
since
de
naarboveck
disappeared
from
here
and
you
imagine
there
is
still
time
to
catch
him
it
is
childish
but
juve
i
tell
you
de
naarboveck
must
return
to
his
house
let
us
put
a
watch
on
him
and
trap
him
juve
voice
trembled
as
he
made
answer
we
can
not
arrest
de
naarboveck
why
what
do
you
mean
because
though
i
have
the
right
to
place
my
hand
on
the
collar
of
fantômas
i
have
no
power
to
arrest
de
naarboveck
fandor
reply
to
this
was
an
uncomprehending
stare
it
greek
to
you
i
see
trust
me
fandor
at
present
i
have
no
right
to
reveal
this
secret
but
take
my
word
for
it
naarboveck
is
inviolable
fandor
understood
that
this
was
an
official
secret
which
juve
was
not
at
liberty
to
divulge
ye
gods
he
exclaimed
bah
the
game
is
not
lost
yet
fandor
my
boy
i
have
still
a
card
to
play
against
his
and
i
play
it
this
very
night
enough
of
that
for
the
moment
i
am
dying
to
know
how
you
whom
i
believed
peacefully
reposing
at
happen
to
be
playing
the
part
of
fantômas
in
deserted
studios
juve
coolness
was
infectious
fandor
was
himself
again
he
told
juve
the
story
of
his
escape
at
the
close
he
asked
abruptly
now
what
are
we
going
to
do
juve
shook
his
head
attention
my
lad
do
mix
up
the
questions
what
am
i
going
to
do
what
are
you
going
to
do
you
fandor
ought
to
return
to
straight
away
and
ask
them
to
put
you
back
in
your
cell
that
is
the
wise
thing
to
do
believe
me
dear
lad
to
get
away
like
that
was
a
mistake
a
very
grave
mistake
the
falsest
of
false
moves
to
escape
is
equivalent
to
pleading
guilty
you
are
innocent
return
then
to
your
prison
i
can
promise
you
that
you
will
not
remain
there
long
and
you
juve
juve
rose
yawned
oh
it
is
a
nuisance
but
i
must
get
into
evening
dress
and
that
i
do
not
like
i
must
go
by
train
too
confound
it
all
in
a
sumptuously
decorated
study
an
elegantly
clad
juve
was
listening
to
a
personage
this
personage
was
addressing
our
detective
in
a
tone
at
once
friendly
and
haughty
no
it
is
not
possible
it
is
asking
too
much
of
me
you
do
not
take
into
consideration
juve
the
many
complications
which
such
an
intervention
on
my
part
would
give
rise
to
if
by
chance
you
are
mistaken
i
have
the
greatest
confidence
in
you
juve
i
know
your
ability
i
have
had
proof
of
your
loyalty
i
have
experienced
your
devotion
but
you
are
not
infallible
the
story
you
have
told
me
is
so
strange
so
improbable
that
i
have
to
take
into
consideration
the
possibility
of
there
having
been
some
mistake
some
blunder
i
have
to
consider
the
terrible
consequences
to
which
i
should
expose
myself
in
such
a
case
juve
frowned
slightly
with
all
respect
i
should
like
to
point
out
to
your
majesty
that
it
is
a
mere
question
of
a
signature
to
be
a
signature
juve
which
commits
me
my
kingdom
it
might
fan
the
flame
worse
it
might
put
a
match
to
the
powder
magazine
your
majesty
might
consider
that
by
such
a
signature
the
thing
would
be
settled
juve
for
the
hundredth
time
i
repeat
i
can
not
give
you
this
order
however
far
back
in
our
annals
you
might
go
i
am
convinced
you
could
not
find
a
precedent
for
this
your
majesty
will
not
forget
that
with
his
name
a
line
of
his
writing
all
difficulties
would
be
cleared
away
oh
as
to
that
have
you
considered
that
if
this
decree
be
unmerited
this
document
will
be
a
shameful
one
and
will
reflect
shame
not
only
on
me
but
on
my
country
do
you
not
know
that
a
king
has
no
right
to
put
his
signature
his
seal
to
an
injustice
sire
i
know
that
a
king
should
be
justice
sire
i
know
i
ask
nothing
your
majesty
may
not
grant
sire
i
have
urged
entreated
but
your
majesty
must
excuse
me
when
i
say
that
i
am
no
longer
a
suppliant
your
majesty
understands
me
it
is
juve
who
requests
the
signature
of
your
majesty
the
king
was
visibly
hesitating
at
last
he
replied
i
understand
you
juve
you
would
remind
me
of
that
official
visit
to
paris
when
you
saved
my
life
and
the
life
of
my
queen
at
the
risk
of
your
own
i
told
you
then
that
i
should
never
refuse
you
anything
you
asked
of
me
it
is
to
that
you
allude
is
it
not
sire
i
should
never
call
upon
your
majesty
to
pay
a
debt
you
did
not
acknowledge
i
did
not
then
foresee
that
a
decree
from
your
majesty
would
prove
the
solution
of
the
most
formidable
problem
i
have
ever
had
to
solve
i
would
far
rather
not
recall
the
debt
your
majesty
has
forced
me
to
remind
you
of
your
given
the
king
had
risen
and
was
pacing
the
room
if
i
grant
you
this
decree
juve
will
you
take
it
to
the
chancellor
office
as
soon
as
you
reach
paris
yes
sire
you
will
not
wait
juve
to
have
further
proofs
of
what
you
assert
no
sire
i
must
then
rely
solely
on
your
word
for
it
your
certainty
your
conviction
yes
sire
juve
juve
if
you
exact
this
in
the
name
of
the
promise
i
once
made
you
i
will
sign
this
decree
for
you
but
you
will
forfeit
my
friendship
you
will
have
taken
my
good
faith
by
storm
decide
then
juve
exact
this
i
grant
it
you
there
was
a
silence
juve
broke
it
surely
your
majesty
does
not
wish
to
put
me
on
the
horns
of
such
a
dilemma
lose
your
majesty
friendship
confidence
or
let
pass
a
unique
opportunity
yes
juve
that
is
what
i
wish
in
that
case
sire
i
do
not
exact
payment
but
your
majesty
is
breaking
to
pieces
all
that
my
life
means
sire
my
own
honour
wills
it
that
i
bring
this
business
to
a
conclusion
cost
what
it
may
with
your
majesty
support
it
was
possible
with
only
my
own
resources
to
depend
on
all
is
lost
it
evidently
cost
the
king
something
not
to
give
juve
the
satisfaction
he
implored
juve
this
is
cruel
i
would
rather
you
had
exacted
the
decree
but
all
is
not
ended
i
will
order
an
investigation
in
a
fortnight
in
a
fortnight
time
your
majesty
knows
it
will
be
too
late
the
king
continued
his
pacing
up
and
down
he
was
considering
the
question
juve
can
you
bring
me
face
to
face
with
this
man
can
you
convict
him
of
his
imposture
in
my
presence
what
exactly
does
your
majesty
mean
i
mean
juve
that
whatever
might
be
the
scandal
the
humiliation
it
might
result
in
for
me
i
would
grant
you
here
and
now
the
decree
you
claim
if
i
were
assured
that
you
had
not
made
a
mistake
you
bring
me
suppositions
juve
but
no
proofs
arrange
so
that
this
man
throws
off
his
mask
if
but
for
an
instant
and
i
will
allow
your
justice
to
take
its
course
juve
forget
that
you
are
speaking
to
a
king
think
of
me
as
your
friend
whatever
the
risks
to
be
run
can
you
bring
us
face
to
face
under
such
conditions
that
the
truth
will
be
apparent
to
me
juve
reflected
he
raised
his
head
and
looked
at
the
king
your
majesty
said
he
slowly
i
am
going
to
ask
you
to
take
an
extraordinary
step
i
am
going
to
ask
your
majesty
to
perhaps
risk
your
life
i
am
going
to
ask
your
juve
emotion
was
such
that
he
could
scarcely
speak
mastering
it
he
said
in
a
low
voice
i
am
going
to
ask
your
majesty
to
accompany
me
in
three
days
time
xxxv
at
the
council
of
war
the
council
gentlemen
stand
up
shoulder
arms
rest

the
seven
military
judges
of
the
council
of
war
advanced
solemnly
in
single
file
they
were
in
full
dress
uniform
sabres
epaulettes
regulation
plumes
on
helmets
and
caps
with
all
due
ceremony
they
took
their
respective
places
at
a
long
table
this
opened
at
one
on
the
afternoon
of
the
of
december
the
president
was
a
colonel
of
dragoons
a
smart
man
whose
fair
hair
was
slightly
tinged
with
grey
at
the
temples
on
the
right
of
the
tribunal
before
a
bureau
piled
with
voluminous
case
papers
was
seated
commandant
dumoulin
redder
in
the
face
than
ever
the
place
next
him
was
filled
by
lieutenant
servin
who
showed
himself
the
very
pink
of
correctness
and
meticulous
elegance
seated
near
the
lieutenant
was
a
officer
acting
as
clerk
of
court
the
government
commissioners
had
their
backs
to
the
court
windows
which
looked
on
to
a
very
large
garden
facing
them
was
the
dock
guarded
by
two
soldiers
with
fixed
bayonets
behind
the
dock
was
the
table
which
stood
for
the
bar
where
the
counsel
for
the
defence
would
plead
the
centre
of
the
room
was
occupied
by
an
enormous
stove
shedding
cinders
on
every
side
whose
ancient
pipes
were
scaly
with
age
behind
the
line
of
soldiers
cutting
the
room
in
two
were
narrow
seats
and
still
narrower
desks
where
the
representatives
of
the
legal
press
were
seated
as
best
they
could
behind
the
journalists
pressed
a
tightly
packed
crowd
restless
overflowing
with
curiosity
leaning
on
the
shoulders
peering
between
their
heads
for
whom
the
authorities
had
shown
but
scant
consideration
and
for
whom
the
poorest
accommodation
was
provided
all
paris
had
done
their
possible
to
be
present
begging
cards
of
admittance
a
favour
which
could
be
granted
to
a
very
limited
number
as
soon
as
the
interest
aroused
by
the
appearance
of
the
members
of
the
council
of
war
had
died
down
the
crowd
attention
was
concentrated
on
the
hero
of
this
sensational
adventure
his
doings
had
been
the
one
prevailing
topic
of
conversation
during
the
past
few
days
jérôme
fandor
modest
reserved
appeared
indifferent
to
the
mute
questioning
of
the
hundreds
of
eyes
focussed
on
him
our
journalist
wore
corporal
vinson
uniform
he
had
begged
the
authorities
to
let
him
appear
in
civilian
clothes
demands
and
entreaties
had
been
so
much
breath
wasted
the
counsel
assigned
him
was
a
shining
light
of
the
junior
bar
maître
the
audience
on
the
whole
was
favourably
disposed
towards
this
contributor
to
they
knew
that
on
many
occasions
this
journalist
had
rendered
immense
services
to
honest
folk
and
to
society
in
general
by
placing
his
intelligence
and
energy
at
the
service
of
every
good
cause
then
there
was
one
strong
indisputable
point
in
his
favour
though
he
had
escaped
from
prison
with
the
help
of
an
unknown
person
he
had
returned
had
given
himself
up
declaring
he
would
not
leave
the
council
of
war
except
by
the
big
door
with
head
held
high
his
innocence
established
the
president
announced
we
shall
now
call
the
names
of
the
witnesses
there
was
silence
in
the
while
a
sergeant
who
filled
the
office
of
crier
to
the
court
read
out
the
names
from
a
list
in
his
hands
the
lasted
ten
minutes
most
of
the
witnesses
were
officers
and
men
belonging
to
the
garrisons
of
verdun
and
châlons
among
these
witnesses
as
they
defiled
before
the
tribunal
fandor
recognised
some
whose
faces
were
graven
on
his
memory

his
brief
sojourn
in

in

and
comforted
fandor
had
not

said
to
him
you
must
face
your
judges
little
son
but
i
am
greatly
deceived
if
a
certain
incident
which
will
occur
in
the
course
of
the
hearing
will
not
alter
the
speech
for
the
government
from
the
first
to
the
last
more
than
this
juve
could
not
be
got
to
say
he
had
put
on
his
most
enigmatic
manner
and
closed
his
lips

the
council

fandor
accused
stand
up
the
president
stared
hard
at
the
prisoner
with
his
pale
clear
eyes
like
porcelain
expressing
neither
thoughts
nor
feelings
fandor
stood
erect
waiting
an
hour
had
gone
by
juve
the
first
witness
called
was
finishing
his
evidence
of
all
the
witnesses
he
alone
could
give
precise
details
which
would
confirm
or
nullify
fandor
statements
juve
had
given
a
rapid
sketch
of
fandor
adventurous
career

had
carefully
omitted
to
mention
that

his
defence
of
his
friend
was
a
eulogy
nevertheless
the
revelations
of
juve
did
not
simplify
the
problem
as
regards
the
grave
charges
of
murder
and
spying
brought
against
the
prisoner
when
juve
had
finished
his
panegyric
the
president
spoke
to
the
point
all
this
is
very
well
gentlemen
very
well
but
the
affair
grows
more
and
more
complicated
and
who
will
come
forward
to
elucidate
it
from
the
back
of
the
court
came
a
sound
clear
i
the
sensation
was
immense
members
of
the
council
looked
at
one
another
there
was
a
disturbance
at
the
back
of
the
room
the
crowd
swayed
and
peered
and
whispered
the
frowned
he
scrutinised
the
swaying
mass
he
shot
a
question
at
it
who
spoke
sharp
distinct
a
monosyllable
was
shot
back
i
someone
pushing
a
way
through
the
audience
was
approaching
the
military
tribunal
a
murmur
rose
from
the
crowd
silence
shouted
the
colonel
he
swept
the
crowd
with
an
angry
eye
he
threatened
i
warn
you
at
the
least
manifestation
favourable
or
otherwise
i
shall
have
the
room
cleared
we
are
not
here
to
amuse
ourselves
i
do
not
authorise
anyone
either
by
gesture
or
by
speech
to
comment
on
what
is
taking
place
within
these
walls
having
obtained
comparative
quiet
the
colonel
looked
squarely
at
the
person
who
had
approached
the
and
was
facing
the
military
tribunal
this
witness
was
a
young
woman
elegantly
clad
she
wore
black
furs
and
a
dark
veil
partially
concealing
her
features
but
revealing
the
strange
pallor
of
her
face
the
audience
who
had
a
view
of
the
newcomer
back
noted
her
masses
of
tawny
red
hair
set
off
by
a
fur
toque
the
colonel
put
her
to
the
question
at
once
you
are
the
person
who
said
the
young
woman
was
greatly
moved
but
she
answered
firmly
yes
monsieur
that
is
so
who
are
you
madame
the
witness
collected
her
forces
pressed
her
hand
to
her
heart
as
though
to
still
its
frantic
beating
paused
in
a
clear
strong
voice
she
made
her
declaration
i
am
mademoiselle
berthe
i
am
better
known
as
bobinette
exclamations
from
the
crowd
craning
necks
peering
eyes
murmurs
when
the
excitement
was
suppressed
the
colonel
interrogated
bobinette
why
have
you
taken
upon
yourself
to
interrupt
the
proceedings
of
the
court
you
asked
monsieur
who
could
clear
up
this
unfortunate
affair
i
am
ready
to
tell
you
everything
not
only
is
it
a
duty
imposed
on
me
by
my
conscience
it
is
also
my
most
ardent
wish
the
judges
were
in
earnest
consultation
commandant
dumoulin
was
shaking
his
head
he
was
angrily
opposed
to
this
witness
being
heard
a
witness
who
had
appeared
so
inopportunely
to
trouble
the
majesty
of
the
sitting
the
counsel
for
the
defence
intervened
monsieur
the
president
i
have
the
honour
to
request
an
immediate
hearing
for
this
witness
it
is
your
absolute
right
monsieur
the
president
you
have
full
discretionary
powers
and
if
i
oppose
it
growled
the
commandant
behind
his
desk
with
a
vicious
glance
at
the
defender
of
his
adversary
maître
replied
with
calm
dignity
if
you
oppose
it
monsieur
the
commissaire
i
shall
have
the
honour
of
immediately
deposing
on
the
bureau
of
this
tribunal
conclusive
evidence
which
will
bring
this
sitting
to
a
close
forthwith
an
animated
discussion
ensued
between
the
members
of
the
council
it
resulted
in
the
colonel
announcement
we
will
hear
this
witness
he
addressed
bobinette
you
are
allowed
to
speak
mademoiselle
swear
then
to
speak
the
truth
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
raise
your
right
hand
and
say
swear
it
with
a
certain
dignity
bobinette
obeyed
i
swear
it
then
in
a
low
trembling
voice
trembling
from
excess
of
emotion
but
not
from
timidity
bobinette
began
her
story
a
child
of
the
people
honestly
brought
up
she
had
not
always
followed
the
straight
path
of
virtue
there
had
been
lapses
intelligent
longing
to
learn
she
had
been
well
educated
and
had
intended
to
take
a
medical
degree
again
at
the
hospital
she
had
succumbed
to
temptations
had
led
a
life
of
idleness
and
had
renounced
all
idea
of
working
for
her
doctor
diploma
instead
she
had
become
a
hospital
nurse
footnote
see
vol
i
fantômas
series
here
the
colonel
interrupted
what
can
these
details
matter
to
us
mademoiselle
what
we
want
to
know
is
not
your
own
history
but
that
of
the
guilty
person
information
pertinent
to
the
case
in
hand
in
a
strangely
solemn
voice
bobinette
replied
you
would
know
the
history
of
the
guilty
person
listen
the
tribunal
was
impressed
the
members
silent
attentive
let
the
witness
have
her
way
bobinette
touched
on
the
various
stages
of
her
life
up
to
the
day
when
she
came
in
contact
with
the
baron
de
naarboveck
the
care
she
had
lavished
on
the
youthful
wilhelmine
gained
the
gratitude
of
the
rich
diplomat
and
his
daughter
from
that
time
they
treated
her
as
one
of
themselves
she
became
mademoiselle
de
naarboveck
companion
ah
cursed
be
that
day
cried
bobinette
misfortunes
tragedies
date
from
then
the
worst
is
i
must
confess
it
i
was
the
cause
of
them
what
do
you
mean
by
that
interrupted
commandant
dumoulin
i
mean
to
say
that
if
captain
brocq
died
by
an
assassin
hand
the
blame
is
mine
i
mean
to
say
that
if
a
confidential
document
disappeared
from
his
rooms
it
is
because
i
took
it
i
was
his
mistress
i
am
responsible
for
his
death
there
was
a
gasping
silence
the
sensation
was
intense
juve
half
hidden
behind
the
stove
alone
remained
unmoved
bobinette
continued
my
evil
genius
gentlemen
was
a
bandit
of
the
worst
kind
you
know
him
under
the
name
of
vagualame
vagualame
agent
of
the
second
bureau
and
officially
a
quite
so
but
gentlemen
vagualame
was
equally
spying
on
france
a
traitor
in
the
pay
of
a
foreign
power
worse
still
he
it
was
who
assassinated
captain
brocq
you
know
he
was
the
murderer
of
the
singer
nichoune
this
vagualame
made
of
me
his
thing
his
slave
alas
i
can
not
pretend
that
it
was
under
the
perpetual
menace
from
this
monster
i
became
a
traitor
i
have
so
many
betrayals
that
must
count
against
me
betrayal
of
my
country
betrayal
of
captain
brocq
love
for
me
i
robbed
him
in
every
kind
of
way
i
stole
the
document
referring
to
the
mobilisation
scheme
i
stole
his
money
with
the
excuse
that
it
was
to
put
the
police
on
the
wrong
scent
and
make
them
believe
it
was
an
ordinary
burglary
these
notes
gentlemen
were
found
in
the
possession
of
the
unfortunate
jérôme
fandor
it
seems
they
constitute
an
overwhelming
charge
against
him
know
then
that
after
having
been
stolen
by
my
hands
they
were
given
to
jérôme
fandor
by
one
of
our
agents
for
the
purpose
of
compromising
the
false
corporal
vinson
but
if
i
have
acted
thus
it
was
not
so
much
through
a
desire
for
the
money
they
gave
me
for
my
treachery
not
so
much
for
the
fallacious
promises
of
eventual
riches
which
vagualame
was
always
trying
to
dazzle
me
with
it
was
through
rancour
spite
hate
it
was
through
love
maître
rose
and
bending
towards
the
bobinette
cried
speak
speak
mademoiselle
bobinette
went
on
slowly
through
love
yes
and
it
is
an
avowal
which
touches
me
nearly
wounds
me
in
the
depths
of
my
soul
in
my
most
intimate
thoughts
yes
i
have
given
away
to
the
vile
suggestions
of
vagualame
if
i
have
let
myself
be
drawn
by
him
into
horrible
of
spying
and
treason
it
is
owing
to
the
spite
and
rage
of
an
unrequited
love
of
an
intense
passion
intense
beyond
expression
which
i
have
felt
for
a
man
a
man
whose
heart
was
given
to
another
for
the
betrothed
of
mademoiselle
de
naarboveck
for
lieutenant
henri
de
lou
the
with
a
brusque
gesture
interrupted
this
confession
enough
mademoiselle
enough
you
are
not
to
mention
names
here
be
good
enough
to
continue
your
deposition
only
as
it
relates
to
facts
connected
with
spying
bobinette
then
recounted
how
she
had
consented
to
hide
the
famous
gun
piece
brought
to
her
one
day
by
vagualame
how
she
had
helped
the
bandit
to
concoct
the
daring
plan
by
which
this
piece
was
to
be
handed
to
a
foreign
power
how
she
had
disguised
herself
as
a
priest
in
order
to
take
corporal
vinson
to
dieppe
she
did
not
know
at
first
that
she
was
dealing
with
jérôme
fandor
enlightenment
came
through
vagualame
telegram
she
only
then
realised
that
the
traitor
vinson
and
the
soldier
in
her
company
were
two
distinct
persons
and
cried
she
who
killed
the
real
corporal
vinson
but
a
few
days
ago
in
the
rue
du
i
know
it
was
the
murderer
of
captain
brocq
the
murderer
of
the
singer
nichoune
it
was
vagualame
vagualame
bobinette
was
working
herself
up
to
a
paroxysm
of
exasperation
shouting
out
her
revelations
like
an
apostle
who
means
to
convince
shouting
his
convictions
as
a
martyr
might
at
the
worst
moment
of
her
anguish
vagualame
you
ask
who
he
is
and
you
search
among
the
thieves
the
receivers
of
stolen
goods
and
gentry
you
search
among
the
secret
agents
among
that
low
unclean
crowd
which
gravitates
to
your
staff
offices
and
circulates
about
them
forever
on
the
watch
on
the
prowl
to
surprise
some
secret
to
buy
over
some
conscience
to
sell
and
bargain
over
some
purloined
document
look
higher
than
that
gentlemen
much
higher
look
higher
than
the
staff
offices
than
the
leaders
in
the
political
world
than
members
of
the
government
even
fix
your
attention
on
the
accredited
representatives
of
foreign
bobinette
was
unable
to
continue
commandant
dumoulin
had
been
too
excited
to
remain
in
his
seat
he
rushed
towards
the
witness
who
was
making
what
he
considered
to
be
wild
and
outrageous
statements
he
put
his
big
hand
over
her
mouth
effectually
silencing
her
the
commandant
turned
to
the
colonel
shouting
colonel
monsieur
the
president
i
demand
that
this
case
be
now
heard
in
camera
such
accusations
must
not
be
heard
in
public
i
beg
you
to
order
that
the
rest
of
this
case
be
heard
behind
closed
doors
the
counsel
for
the
defence
rose
in
his
turn
and
in
a
calm
tone
which
contrasted
with
the
violence
of
commandant
dumoulin
declared
i
am
in
agreement
with
this
demand
monsieur
the
president
will
you
order
that
the
further
hearing
of
this
case
be
in
camera
here
commandant
dumoulin
to
whom
lieutenant
servin
had
made
a
suggestion
intervened
anew
monsieur
the
president
gentlemen
having
regard
to
the
grave
declarations
made
by
this
witness
i
require
her
immediate
arrest
hardly
had
this
demand
been
voiced
when
a
loud
cry
rang
out
electrifying
the
whole
court
bobinette
had
swallowed
the
contents
of
a
small
phial
hidden
in
her
muff
juve
guessing
bobinette
intention
had
rushed
to
her
but
in
spite
of
his
rapid
action
he
reached
her
only
in
time
to
receive
the
fainting
girl
in
his
arms
she
has
poisoned
herself
shouted
juve
the
public
broke
bounds
knocked
over
chairs
and
benches
rolled
in
a
surge
of
excited
curiosity
to
the
very
feet
of
the
council
of
war
crowding
round
this
fresh
centre
of
interest
bobinette
fandor
was
too
stunned
by
the
avalanche
of
incidents
to
move
the
hearing
is
suspended
shouted
the
colonel
in
an
angry
voice
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
done
the
court
was
in
an
uproar
it
was
nine
in
the
evening
and
a
crowd
as
large
and
densely
packed
as
before
awaited
the
verdict
since
bobinette
attempted
suicide
she
had
been
removed
to
the
infirmary
with
the
faint
hope
that
life
was
not
extinct
and
she
might
yet
be
saved
the
hearing
had
been
conducted
in
camera
but
the
revelations
of
the
guilty
girl
had
not
only
upset
dumoulin
course
of
procedure
but
had
also
convinced
the
judges
of
fandor
innocence
he
had
once
more
explained
why
he
had
concealed
his
identity
beneath
the
uniform
of
corporal
vinson
the
council
of
war
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
they
could
not
consider
fandor
accountable
to
their
tribunal
at
nine
then
after
a
short
deliberation
the
council
of
war
delivered
judgment
through
the
mouth
of
its
president
delivered
judgment
according
to
the
solemn
formula
commencing
thus
the
name
of
the
french
people
jérôme
fandor
was
acquitted
the
news
of
his
acquittal
was
received
with
hearty
cheers
fandor
was
free
congratulations
questions
followed
mechanically
he
responded
though
he
had
a
smile
for
lieutenant
servin
when
he
murmured
with
a
touch
of
irony
the
judgment
made
no
mention
monsieur
fandor
of
the
clothes
the
borrowed
clothes
you
are
wearing
but
it
seems
to
be
established
that
they
do
not
belong
to
you
be
kind
enough
then
to
return
them
to
the
authorities
as
soon
as
possible
otherwise
we
shall
be
obliged
to
summon
you
afresh
for
appropriation
of
military
garments
the
lieutenant
had
had
his
little
joke
and
departed
laughing
the
crowd
melted
away
only
a
few
of
fandor
colleagues
remained
to
them
he
talked
more
freely
of
his
troubles
and
trials
then
juve
arrived
on
the
scene
again
he
was
no
longer
the
impassive
listener
of
the
trial
he
was
friend
juve
beaming
and
joyous
he
embraced
his
dear
fandor
effusively
murmuring
now
old
fandor
this
is
not
the
moment
to
linger
we
must
be
off
instanter
i
shall
see
you
to
your
flat
where
you
can
change
into
clothes
of
your
own
for
this
evening
we
have
our
work
cut
out
for
us
this
evening
fandor
curiosity
was
aroused
juve
as
they
went
off
together
became
mysterious
ah
you
will
understand
presently
xxxvi
ambassador
hurry
up
fandor
we
must
be
off
we
shall
be
late
jérôme
fandor
slipped
on
his
overcoat
and
took
the
stairs
at
a
rush
in
the
wake
of
juve
well
i
like
that
old
juve
here
have
i
been
waiting
for
you
a
good
quarter
of
an
hour
you
will
have
to
give
the
coachman
an
address
anyhow
and
that
will
tell
me
where
you
are
taking
me
why
you
have
made
me
get
into
evening
clothes
and
why
you
are
in
that
unusual
yourself
it
unheard
of
it
is
true
lad
i
amuse
myself
making
mysteries
it
is
stupid
well
fandor
we
are
going
to
a
a
ball
yes
and
i
think
we
shall
lead
someone
there
a
fine
dance
or
i
am
much
mistaken
who
then
the
master
of
the
house
you
speak
in
riddles
juve
not
at
all
do
you
know
where
we
are
going
fandor
lad
i
ask
you
that
juve
well
then
we
are
going
to
the
house
of
fantômas
to
arrest
him
ye
gods
and
little
fishes
cried
fandor
juve
crossed
the
pavement
and
jumped
into
a
carriage
making
room
for
his
dear
lad
beside
him
but
juve
remonstrated
fandor
you
declared
to
me
the
other
day
that
it
was
impossible
to
arrest
de
naarboveck
that
he
was
inviolable
but
you
did
not
tell
me
why
is
that
true
it
is
true
and
it
is
so
no
longer
it
still
is
so
after
all
he
had
been
through
fandor
was
in
a
state
of
high
tension
he
caught
juve
hand
and
beat
it
with
angry
impatience
do
quibble
juve
it
is
too
deadly
serious
what
do
you
really
mean
we
know
that
de
naarboveck
is
fantômas
but
you
swore
to
me
that
it
is
impossible
to
arrest
naarboveck
you
still
assert
this
nevertheless
you
now
declare
that
we
are
going
to
arrest
fantômas
what
the
deuce
do
you
mean
i
had
more
than
enough
of
your
ironical
mockery
old
man
juve
took
out
his
watch
and
with
finger
on
the
dial
said
look
it
is
half
past
ten
we
shall
reach
de
naarboveck
about
a
quarter
past
eleven
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
arrest
him
just
then
but
at
a
quarter
to
twelve
midnight
at
latest
it
will
be
quite
easy
for
me
to
put
my
hand
on
the
collar
of
de
naarboveck
fantômas
i
shall
not
bungle
it
juve
you
and
your
mysteries
are
maddening
my
dear
fandor
do
pardon
me
for
not
being
more
explicit
i
told
you
naarboveck
was
out
of
reach
as
far
as
arresting
him
goes
i
also
told
you
that
we
were
going
to
arrest
fantômas
it
is
exact
because
all
that
is
subordinate
to
a
will
a
will
i
happen
to
have
at
my
command
for
the
moment
but
also
a
will
which
may
raise
some
preventing
obstacle
at
the
last
moment
and
so
stop
me
from
capturing
the
bandit
straight
away
enabling
the
monster
to
brazen
it
out
in
perfect
safety
whose
will
juve
my
lad
do
not
question
me
further
i
can
not
say
more
fandor
desisted
juve
sincerity
was
obvious
all
serene
juve
i
leave
it
to
you
whatever
happens
i
shall
try
not
to
lose
sight
of
you
i
shall
stick
to
you
like
a
leech
if
you
have
need
of
me
juve
held
out
his
hands
thanks
dear
lad
with
hearts
thrilling
with
excitement
expectation
anxiety
the
friends
embraced
you
know
dear
lad
said
juve
in
quiet
tones
we
are
going
to
risk
our
skins
i
am
sure
of
the
final
victory
unless
a
stupid
ball
from
a
fandor
was
his
old
teasing
self
once
more
oh
that
all
right
you
are
not
going
to
frighten
me
with
that
old
black
bogey
of
yours
at
this
moment
the
carriage
turned
the
corner
at
the
end
of
the
alexander
bridge
the
baron
de
naarboveck
mansion
was
brilliantly
illuminated
the
fête
was
at
its
height
below
the
spacious
hall
had
been
turned
into
a
magnificent
a
veritable
transformation
scene
while
dancers
thronged
the
rooms
above
the
end
room
only
was
deserted
it
was
the
library
it
had
been
made
the
receptacle
of
an
overflow
of
furniture
when
the
reception
suite
was
cleared
for
dancing
an
orchestra
concealed
by
foliage
plants
discoursed
seductive
waltzes
in
the
principal
ballroom
whilst
crowds
of
lovely
women
and
distinguished
men
listened
chatted
and
looked
on
madame
paradel
wife
of
the
minister
for
foreign
affairs
was
talking
to
her
host
observing
wilhelmine
all
grace
and
smiles
she
murmured
what
a
charming
girl
she
is
turning
again
to
de
naarboveck
she
remarked
but
you
must
be
in
the
depths
of
desolation
dear
baron
have
i
not
heard
that
the
young
couple
are
leaving
for
the
centre
of
africa
oh
that
is
an
exaggeration
laughed
the
baron
as
a
matter
of
fact
my
future
de
loubersac
is
leaving
the
staff
office
and
with
the
rank
of
captain
his
chiefs
are
sending
him
not
as
you
think
to
the
wilds
of
central
africa
but
only
to
algiers
an
excellent
garrison
well
baron
i
like
to
think
you
will
soon
be
paying
a
visit
to
your
newly
married
pair
the
baron
bowed
and
as
madame
paradel
moved
away
he
went
towards
the
entrance
of
the
gallery
commanding
a
view
of
the
hall
and
stairs
the
figures
of
two
advancing
guests
had
caught
his
eye
in
a
tone
at
once
enigmatic
and
perfectly
correct
de
naarboveck
accosted
them
you
are
among
my
guests
gentlemen
that
is
obvious
is
it
not
replied
one
of
the
you
may
be
assured
baron
that
neither
my
friend
fandor
nor
i
would
have
allowed
ourselves
the
liberty
i
know
i
know
monsieur
juve
besides
i
was
expecting
you
an
ironic
smile
curved
the
lips
of
de
naarboveck
we
should
have
reproached
ourselves
baron
had
we
not
come
this
evening
to
offer
you
the
felicitations
to
which
you
have
a
right
really
no
doubt
you
refer
to
the
marriage
of
wilhelmine
no
baron
i
reserve
such
congratulations
for
monsieur
de
loubersac
and
mademoiselle
thérèse
pardon
for
mademoiselle
wilhelmine
when
making
this
deliberate
mistake
in
the
name
juve
looked
squarely
at
the
diplomat
but
de
naarboveck
made
no
sign
what
then
do
you
refer
to
monsieur
juve
he
asked
i
mean
my
dear
baron
that
i
have
recently
heard
of
your
new
office
heard
that
your
credentials
have
just
been
presented
heard
that
they
will
be
ratified
from
this
evening
baron
are
you
not
then
the
representative
of
the
kingdom
of
i
fancy
monsieur
the
ambassador
that
you
are
satisfied
with
this
nomination
de
naarboveck
smiling
that
ironical
smile
bowed
it
carries
with
it
some
advantages
certainly
among
them
baron
the
privilege
of
inviolability
ah
that
famous
inviolability
juve
laid
stress
on
the
word
de
naarboveck
did
not
seem
to
understand
the
insinuation
conveyed
it
is
quite
true
monsieur
he
said
in
a
manner
i
do
enjoy
the
right
of
inviolability
it
is
one
of
the
privileges
attached
to
my
office
on
a
bantering
note
he
added
an
appreciable
advantage
is
it
not
appreciable
indeed
was
juve
reply
a
wave
of
fresh
arrivals
surged
up
the
grand
staircase
and
separated
the
speakers
the
master
of
the
house
stepped
forward
to
greet
them
whilst
fandor
drew
juve
by
the
sleeve
into
the
corner
of
a
window
recess
speaking
low
he
asked
juve
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
comedy
alas
fandor
it
is
no
comedy
de
naarboveck
is
an
ambassador
for
the
kingdom
of
yes
he
has
been
that
for
over
a
week
since
that
evening
we
failed
to
arrest
him
in
the
rue
lepic
and
he
is
inviolable
naturally
in
conformity
with
international
conventions
every
representative
accredited
to
a
foreign
power
as
ambassador
is
an
untouchable
inviolable
person
wherever
he
may
be
therefore
fandor
when
in
this
mansion
situated
in
the
heart
of
paris
we
are
no
longer
legally
in
france
but
in
you
can
understand
the
kind
of
consequences
which
must
follow
from
such
a
state
of
things
but
all
is
not
over
ah
excuse
me
there
is
something
i
must
see
to
immediately
leaving
fandor
juve
made
his
way
through
innumerable
and
magnificent
toilettes
moving
with
difficulty
in
the
press
he
approached
a
guest
stationed
apart
watching
all
that
was
going
on
about
him
this
guest
who
stood
unobtrusively
aloof
was
a
man
of
about
he
wore
a
blonde
moustache
turned
up
german
fashion
juve
bowed
low
before
this
personage
and
murmured
with
profound
deference
ah
thank
you
thank
you
for
coming
majesty
here
monsieur
i
am
incognito
the
prince
louis
de
kalbach
respect
my
incognito
and
do
whatever
you
have
to
do
quickly
my
presence
in
paris
is
not
suspected
as
you
are
aware
i
am
fortunately
not
known
personally
to
my
to
this
individual
juve
was
about
to
assure
the
king
that
his
wishes
would
be
respected
but
someone
touched
him
on
the
arm
juve
with
a
respectful
inclination
turned
away
ah
monsieur
juve
how
delighted
i
am
to
see
you
but
i
was
forgetting
monsieur
lépine
was
looking
for
you
just
now
juve
was
facing
beaming
lieutenant
de
loubersac
i
will
go
to
him
at
once
but
let
me
take
this
opportunity
of
congratulating
you
my
dear
juve
slipped
away
to
join
the
popular
chief
commissioner
of
police
who
was
standing
apart
in
the
gallery
overlooking
the
hall
despite
the
amiable
smile
he
cultivated
monsieur
lépine
looked
anxious
juve
are
you
on
duty
here
he
asked
yes
and
no
monsieur
monsieur
lépine
looked
his
surprise
i
will
explain
this
to
you
later
monsieur
said
juve
things
are
still
very
complicated
wilhelmine
de
naarboveck
came
into
view
she
was
one
beam
of
happiness
and
radiant
beauty
ah
monsieur
i
perceive
you
are
not
dancing
she
said
playing
the
good
hostess
to
juve
will
you
not
allow
me
to
introduce
you
to
some
charming
girls
this
is
not
the
time
thought
juve
and
there
is
my
age
to
be
considered
making
an
evasive
reply
juve
beat
a
retreat
in
good
order
and
followed
colonel
hofferman
who
was
talking
to
de
naarboveck
the
work
of
the
second
bureau
declared
that
officer
juve
heard
no
more
monsieur
lépine
confronted
him
the
chief
commissioner
of
police
was
plucking
at
his
pointed
beard
with
nervous
fingers
drawing
juve
aside
he
asked
juve
what
is
headquarters
thinking
about
i
do
not
know
monsieur
what
there
is
a
visitor
here
unnoticed
are
you
also
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
the
baron
de
naarboveck
receives
a
king
here
oh
as
to
that
i
know
it
frederick
christian
ii
monsieur
lépine
was
incensed
at
the
detective
calm
you
know
it
you
know
it
he
grumbled
and
the
administration
knows
nothing
about
well
since
you
know
so
much
what
is
he
doing
here
your
king
he
comes
to
see
me
juve
you
are
mad
no
monsieur
juve
cut
short
the
conversation
approached
the
king
and
said
a
few
words
to
him
in
a
low
voice
the
chief
commissioner
of
police
was
surprised
beyond
words
when
he
saw
the
king
listening
attentively
to
what
juve
had
to
say
then
nod
acquiescence
leave
the
ballroom
and
enter
the
gallery
on
to
which
several
rooms
opened
including
the
library
at
the
far
end
juve
glanced
discreetly
at
his
watch
he
was
startled
his
expression
altered
it
grew
severe
determined
he
glanced
about
him
discovered
de
naarboveck
not
far
off
and
went
up
to
him
monsieur
de
naarboveck
he
said
shall
we
have
a
few
minutes
talk
not
here
somewhere
else
should
we
say
in
my
library
proposed
de
naarboveck
who
looked
the
detective
up
and
down
a
measuring
glance
cold
contemptuous
their
glances
crossed
hard
menacing
you
are
set
on
it
monsieur
de
naarboveck
tone
was
irony
incarnate
and
what
may
i
ask
is
your
aim
in
forcing
this
conversation
monsieur
juve
reply
came
distinct
determined
unmask
fantômas
that
shall
be
as
you
like
was
the
diplomat
reply
in
the
library
unusually
full
of
furniture
juve
and
de
naarboveck
met
for
their
duel
of
words
and
wits
they
were
by
themselves
juve
had
made
the
baron
pass
into
the
room
before
him
he
knew
there
was
but
one
exit
the
door
if
in
order
to
get
clear
away
de
naarboveck
meant
to
employ
force
or
trickery
he
would
first
have
to
remove
juve
from
the
door
before
which
he
had
stationed
himself
juve
did
not
budge
certainly
there
was
the
window
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
looking
on
to
the
esplanade
des
invalides
curtains
were
drawn
across
the
window
but
juve
did
not
fear
to
see
his
adversary
escape
in
that
direction
he
knew
and
he
alone
knew
it
that
between
this
window
and
the
curtains
there
was
an
obstacle
do
you
remember
monsieur
de
naarboveck
that
evening
when
the
police
came
here
to
arrest
vagualame
yes
replied
de
naarboveck
with
his
ironic
smile
and
it
was
you
monsieur
juve
who
got
yourself
arrested
in
that
disguise
that
is
a
fact
juve
admission
was
do
you
recall
a
certain
conversation
monsieur
de
naarboveck
between
detective
juve
and
the
real
vagualame
at
jérôme
fandor
flat
no
declared
the
baron
and
for
the
very
good
reason
that
the
conversation
you
have
just
said
so
was
a
dialogue
between
two
persons
juve
and
vagualame
nevertheless
this
vagualame
was
none
other
than
fantômas
what
then
de
naarboveck
was
smiling
juve
after
a
short
silence
burnt
his
ships
naarboveck
he
cried
it
is
useless
to
double
like
that
vagualame
is
fantômas
vagualame
is
you
yourself
fantômas
is
you
yourself
we
know
it
we
have
identified
you
and
the
anthropometric
test
will
prove
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
what
is
the
conviction
of
a
certain
few
only
this
long
time
past
you
have
known
yourself
pursued
tracked
you
have
noted
that
the
ring
has
been
drawn
closer
tighter
each
day
so
playing
your
last
trump
card
attempting
even
the
impossible
you
have
planned
this
abominable
comedy
which
consists
in
duping
a
noble
king
and
getting
yourself
nominated
as
his
ambassador
that
you
might
take
advantage
of
diplomatic
inviolability
an
advantage
let
me
tell
you
you
are
in
desperate
need
of
quite
a
good
idea
was
it
not
during
juve
virulent
apostrophe
de
naarboveck
had
maintained
an
ironic
you
confess
then
and
suppose
it
were
so
no
doubt
monsieur
juve
you
intended
to
denounce
me
to
prove
that
the
baron
de
naarboveck
is
none
other
than
fantômas
well
it
pleases
me
to
admit
your
cleverness
i
will
even
go
as
far
as
allow
that
you
may
quite
well
obtain
authorisation
to
arrest
me
in
a
few
days
time
not
in
a
few
days
time
interrupted
juve
but
now
at
once
pardon
objected
de
naarboveck
cool
collected
while
juve
had
difficulty
in
containing
himself
pardon
but
the
credentials
i
possess
are
authentic
and
no
one
in
this
world
can
deprive
me
of
my
function
of
my
official
position
and
what
pertains
to
it
yes
juve
flung
the
word
at
de
naarboveck
as
though
it
were
a
stone
from
a
sling
de
naarboveck
gesture
might
mean
anything
who
juve
hurled
another
two
stones
in
the
shape
of
words
the
king
de
naarboveck
nod
was
malicious
frederick
christian
alone
can
take
from
me
my
style
and
title
of
ambassador
let
him
come
and
do
it
juve
lifted
a
finger
slowly
towards
the
far
end
of
the
library
in
the
direction
of
the
window
de
naarboveck
who
had
followed
this
movement
mechanically
could
not
restrain
a
cry
of
stupefaction
a
cry
of
anguish
the
window
curtain
had
just
been
gradually
drawn
apart
slowly
before
the
miscreant
eyes
appeared
the
majestic
form
of
king
frederick
christian
ii
king
of
the
king
was
livid
with
suppressed
rage
juve
approached
him
his
eyes
on
de
naarboveck
the
king
took
a
large
envelope
from
an
inner
pocket
and
handed
it
to
juve
i
am
the
victim
of
this
monster
imposture
but
i
know
how
to
recognise
my
mistakes
and
rectify
them
monsieur
juve
here
is
the
decree
you
asked
me
for
annulling
the
nomination
of
baron
de
naarboveck
during
this
brief
scene
had
gradually
backed
towards
a
corner
of
the
room
his
face
was
pallid
and
drawn
he
had
the
look
of
a
trapped
beast
of
prey
but
at
the
king
last
words
drew
himself
up
to
a
semblance
of
stateliness
he
also
took
from
an
inner
pocket
a
document
he
held
it
out
to
the
king
his
lips
were
curved
in
a
smile
of
bitter
irony
sire
he
said
i
in
my
turn
hand
you
this
it
is
the
plan
stolen
from
captain
brocq
the
mobilisation
plan
for
the
whole
french
army
a
plan
your
enough
monsieur
shouted
the
king
the
paper
fell
to
the
ground
juve
bent
quickly
and
picked
up
the
document
the
king
as
though
to
anticipate
the
suspicion
which
might
be
put
into
words
said
juve
this
plan
belongs
to
your
country
never
have
we
the
eyes
of
juve
met
those
of
the
king
in
a
deep
questioning
glance
a
question
was
asked
and
answered
then
but
five
seconds
in
time
had
passed
juve
glance
went
back
to
the
bandit
had
disappeared
juve
kept
his
head
michel
he
called
michel
michel
entered
the
library
on
the
instant
he
had
been
posted
in
the
gallery
close
by
behind
him
appeared
several
gentlemen
in
evening
dress
they
were
detectives
despatched
on
special
duty
from
headquarters
fantômas
is
there
michel
juve
cried
concealed
but
not
escaped
there
may
be
some
in
these
walls
we
must
sound
them
but
no
passage
no
exit
i
am
sure
of
that
let
us
carry
out
these
pieces
of
furniture
which
form
a
veritable
barricade
some
moments
passed
tense
with
expectancy
at
juve
earnest
request
the
king
had
left
the
room
he
had
fulfilled
his
promise
and
had
best
begone
juve
and
michel
were
guarding
the
door
the
situation
was
dangerous
and
well
the
policemen
knew
it
they
had
come
to
grips
with
a
formidable
criminal
to
whom
nothing
was
sacred
who
would
stick
at
nothing
protected
by
some
piece
of
furniture
he
could
take
aim
at
his
leisure
shoot
his
opponents
through
the
heart
and
could
go
on
shooting
till
he
had
emptied
his
revolver
start
in
cried
juve
with
six
men
to
aid
him
juve
began
a
systematic
of
the
library
moving
the
furniture
piece
by
piece
leaving
no
hole
no
corner
unsearched
no
fantômas
yet
juve
felt
confident
felt
sure
he
held
the
miscreant
in
the
hollow
of
his
policeman
hand
the
library
contained
no
no
secret
door
no
sliding
panel
covering
his
retreat
the
floor
had
no
opening
in
it
the
ceiling
was
not
movable
take
these
pieces
of
furniture
into
the
gallery
commanded
juve
every
one
of
them
fantômas
is
not
a
being
without
weight
and
substance
though
for
the
moment
he
is
invisible
he
can
not
have
left
the
room
therefore
he
must
be
in
it
it
was
no
easy
task
to
move
quickly
noiselessly
these
heavy
pieces
of
furniture
into
the
gallery
by
way
of
the
narrow
library
door
soon
they
had
carried
out
a
comfortable
leather
of
unusual
proportions
four
other
chairs
a
stand
and
various
smaller
pieces
of
substantial
make
and
all
the
while
dancers
whirled
on
in
the
seductive
strains
of
music
were
wafted
on
the
air
mingled
with
the
hum
of
joyous
talk
and
gay
laughter
yet
in
the
background
were
these
dark
happenings
with
tragedy
ahead
wilhelmine
de
naarboveck
appeared
in
the
doorway
staring
at
the
disorder
organised
by
juve
juve
paused
speech
failed
him
at
sight
of
her
monsieur
juve
said
she
in
quite
ordinary
tones
i
am
so
glad
i
have
found
you
the
baron
de
naarboveck
has
sent
me
to
who
sent
you
did
you
say
mademoiselle
juve
started
forward
the
baron
de
naarboveck
asks
for
me
where
since
when
why
monsieur
juve
i
have
just
this
moment
left
him
at
the
entrance
to
the
he
had
just
come
out
of
here
but
why
are
you
putting
all
this
furniture
in
the
gallery
what
of
the
baron
mademoiselle
cried
juve
on
tenterhooks
ah
yes
the
baron
said
to
me
i
feel
a
little
tired
and
am
going
up
to
my
room
for
a
few
minutes
but
go
to
monsieur
juve
and
tell
not
waiting
to
hear
more
juve
rushed
out
to
the
gallery
but
only
to
stop
dead
he
had
run
up
against
a
large
an
unusually
large
standing
apart
thus
isolated
it
was
remarkable
juve
paused
to
examine
it
this
was
astonishing
extraordinary
yes
it
opened
in
the
middle
a
kind
of
a
double
chair
why
the
interior
could
hold
a
man
who
knew
how
to
pack
himself
in
it
had
a
false
bottom
with
a
spring
one
in
hiding
could
escape
that
way
once
closed
on
the
person
concealed
within
the
chair
looked
empty
a
most
ingenious
juve
now
knew
the
answer
to
the
riddle
of
the
bandit
disappearance
within
an
ace
of
arrest
he
had
seized
the
chance
offered
by
juve
interchange
of
glances
with
the
king
and
with
an
acrobat
agility
had
slipped
inside
this
chair
no
sooner
was
the
chair
abandoned
in
the
gallery
than
de
had
slipped
out
and
away
when
leaving
his
magnificent
house
forever
and
all
the
securities
and
privileges
of
his
position
he
had
sent
wilhelmine
to
announce
his
escape
to
juve
could
cynicism
could
mordant
irony
go
further
juve
felt
crushed
it
was
too
too
much
what
ails
you
juve
asked
a
gentle
voice
beside
him
it
was
fandor
who
knowing
nothing
of
what
had
passed
but
suspecting
there
was
mischief
afoot
had
come
in
search
of
juve
had
he
not
seen
the
diplomat
whom
he
knew
to
be
fantômas
and
fantômas
on
the
point
of
being
arrested
cross
the
ballroom
rapidly
and
disappear
in
the
crowd
of
dancers
juve
could
not
find
words
for
speech
great
tears
rolled
down
his
cheeks
hollowed
and
lined
with
an
immense
fatigue
at
last
he
gave
low
utterance
to
his
feelings
fantômas
i
had
got
him
and
it
was
i
who
had
that
cursed
chair
taken
out
of
the
library
i
did
it
i
it
is
thanks
to
me
juve
could
not
continue
he
burst
into
tears
in
the
arms
of
his
devoted
friend
once
again
juve
had
suffered
shipwreck
when
coming
into
harbour
once
again
the
bandit
had
escaped
ah
decidedly
vagualame
naarboveck
