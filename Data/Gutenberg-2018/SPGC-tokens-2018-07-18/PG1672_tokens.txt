gorgias
by
plato
translated
by
benjamin
jowett
introduction
in
several
of
the
dialogues
of
plato
doubts
have
arisen
among
his
interpreters
as
to
which
of
the
various
subjects
discussed
in
them
is
the
main
thesis
the
speakers
have
the
freedom
of
conversation
no
severe
rules
of
art
restrict
them
and
sometimes
we
are
inclined
to
think
with
one
of
the
dramatis
personae
in
the
theaetetus
that
the
digressions
have
the
greater
interest
yet
in
the
most
irregular
of
the
dialogues
there
is
also
a
certain
natural
growth
or
unity
the
beginning
is
not
forgotten
at
the
end
and
numerous
allusions
and
references
are
interspersed
which
form
the
loose
connecting
links
of
the
whole
we
must
not
neglect
this
unity
but
neither
must
we
attempt
to
confine
the
platonic
dialogue
on
the
procrustean
bed
of
a
single
idea
compare
introduction
to
the
phaedrus
two
tendencies
seem
to
have
beset
the
interpreters
of
plato
in
this
matter
first
they
have
endeavoured
to
hang
the
dialogues
upon
one
another
by
the
slightest
threads
and
have
thus
been
led
to
opposite
and
contradictory
assertions
respecting
their
order
and
sequence
the
mantle
of
schleiermacher
has
descended
upon
his
successors
who
have
applied
his
method
with
the
most
various
results
the
value
and
use
of
the
method
has
been
hardly
if
at
all
examined
either
by
him
or
them
secondly
they
have
extended
almost
indefinitely
the
scope
of
each
separate
dialogue
in
this
way
they
think
that
they
have
escaped
all
difficulties
not
seeing
that
what
they
have
gained
in
generality
they
have
lost
in
truth
and
distinctness
metaphysical
conceptions
easily
pass
into
one
another
and
the
simpler
notions
of
antiquity
which
we
can
only
realize
by
an
effort
imperceptibly
blend
with
the
more
familiar
theories
of
modern
philosophers
an
eye
for
proportion
is
needed
his
own
art
of
measuring
in
the
study
of
plato
as
well
as
of
other
great
artists
we
may
hardly
admit
that
the
moral
antithesis
of
good
and
pleasure
or
the
intellectual
antithesis
of
knowledge
and
opinion
being
and
appearance
are
never
far
off
in
a
platonic
discussion
but
because
they
are
in
the
background
we
should
not
bring
them
into
the
foreground
or
expect
to
discern
them
equally
in
all
the
dialogues
there
may
be
some
advantage
in
drawing
out
a
little
the
main
outlines
of
the
building
but
the
use
of
this
is
limited
and
may
be
easily
exaggerated
we
may
give
plato
too
much
system
and
alter
the
natural
form
and
connection
of
his
thoughts
under
the
idea
that
his
dialogues
are
finished
works
of
art
we
may
find
a
reason
for
everything
and
lose
the
highest
characteristic
of
art
which
is
simplicity
most
great
works
receive
a
new
light
from
a
new
and
original
mind
but
whether
these
new
lights
are
true
or
only
suggestive
will
depend
on
their
agreement
with
the
spirit
of
plato
and
the
amount
of
direct
evidence
which
can
be
urged
in
support
of
them
when
a
theory
is
running
away
with
us
criticism
does
a
friendly
office
in
counselling
moderation
and
recalling
us
to
the
indications
of
the
text
like
the
phaedrus
the
gorgias
has
puzzled
students
of
plato
by
the
appearance
of
two
or
more
subjects
under
the
cover
of
rhetoric
higher
themes
are
introduced
the
argument
expands
into
a
general
view
of
the
good
and
evil
of
man
after
making
an
ineffectual
attempt
to
obtain
a
sound
definition
of
his
art
from
gorgias
socrates
assumes
the
existence
of
a
universal
art
of
flattery
or
simulation
having
several
branches
this
is
the
genus
of
which
rhetoric
is
only
one
and
not
the
highest
species
to
flattery
is
opposed
the
true
and
noble
art
of
life
which
he
who
possesses
seeks
always
to
impart
to
others
and
which
at
last
triumphs
if
not
here
at
any
rate
in
another
world
these
two
aspects
of
life
and
knowledge
appear
to
be
the
two
leading
ideas
of
the
dialogue
the
true
and
the
false
in
individuals
and
states
in
the
treatment
of
the
soul
as
well
as
of
the
body
are
conceived
under
the
forms
of
true
and
false
art
in
the
development
of
this
opposition
there
arise
various
other
questions
such
as
the
two
famous
paradoxes
of
socrates
paradoxes
as
they
are
to
the
world
in
general
ideals
as
they
may
be
more
worthily
called
that
to
do
is
worse
than
to
suffer
evil
and
that
when
a
man
has
done
evil
he
had
better
be
punished
than
unpunished
to
which
may
be
added
a
third
socratic
paradox
or
ideal
that
bad
men
do
what
they
think
best
but
not
what
they
desire
for
the
desire
of
all
is
towards
the
good
that
pleasure
is
to
be
distinguished
from
good
is
proved
by
the
simultaneousness
of
pleasure
and
pain
and
by
the
possibility
of
the
bad
having
in
certain
cases
pleasures
as
great
as
those
of
the
good
or
even
greater
not
merely
rhetoricians
but
poets
musicians
and
other
artists
the
whole
tribe
of
statesmen
past
as
well
as
present
are
included
in
the
class
of
flatterers
the
true
and
false
finally
appear
before
the
of
the
gods
below
the
dialogue
naturally
falls
into
three
divisions
to
which
the
three
characters
of
gorgias
polus
and
callicles
respectively
correspond
and
the
form
and
manner
change
with
the
stages
of
the
argument
socrates
is
deferential
towards
gorgias
playful
and
yet
cutting
in
dealing
with
the
youthful
polus
ironical
and
sarcastic
in
his
encounter
with
callicles
in
the
first
division
the
question
is
asked
what
is
rhetoric
to
this
there
is
no
answer
given
for
gorgias
is
soon
made
to
contradict
himself
by
socrates
and
the
argument
is
transferred
to
the
hands
of
his
disciple
polus
who
rushes
to
the
defence
of
his
master
the
answer
has
at
last
to
be
given
by
socrates
himself
but
before
he
can
even
explain
his
meaning
to
polus
he
must
enlighten
him
upon
the
great
subject
of
shams
or
flatteries
when
polus
finds
his
favourite
art
reduced
to
the
level
of
cookery
he
replies
that
at
any
rate
rhetoricians
like
despots
have
great
power
socrates
denies
that
they
have
any
real
power
and
hence
arise
the
three
paradoxes
already
mentioned
although
they
are
strange
to
him
polus
is
at
last
convinced
of
their
truth
at
least
they
seem
to
him
to
follow
legitimately
from
the
premises
thus
the
second
act
of
the
dialogue
closes
then
callicles
appears
on
the
scene
at
first
maintaining
that
pleasure
is
good
and
that
might
is
right
and
that
law
is
nothing
but
the
combination
of
the
many
weak
against
the
few
strong
when
he
is
confuted
he
withdraws
from
the
argument
and
leaves
socrates
to
arrive
at
the
conclusion
by
himself
the
conclusion
is
that
there
are
two
kinds
of
statesmanship
a
higher
and
a
lower
that
which
makes
the
people
better
and
that
which
only
flatters
them
and
he
exhorts
callicles
to
choose
the
higher
the
dialogue
terminates
with
a
mythus
of
a
final
judgment
in
which
there
will
be
no
more
flattery
or
disguise
and
no
further
use
for
the
teaching
of
rhetoric
the
characters
of
the
three
interlocutors
also
correspond
to
the
parts
which
are
assigned
to
them
gorgias
is
the
great
rhetorician
now
advanced
in
years
who
goes
from
city
to
city
displaying
his
talents
and
is
celebrated
throughout
greece
like
all
the
sophists
in
the
dialogues
of
plato
he
is
vain
and
boastful
yet
he
has
also
a
certain
dignity
and
is
treated
by
socrates
with
considerable
respect
but
he
is
no
match
for
him
in
dialectics
although
he
has
been
teaching
rhetoric
all
his
life
he
is
still
incapable
of
defining
his
own
art
when
his
ideas
begin
to
clear
up
he
is
unwilling
to
admit
that
rhetoric
can
be
wholly
separated
from
justice
and
injustice
and
this
lingering
sentiment
of
morality
or
regard
for
public
opinion
enables
socrates
to
detect
him
in
a
contradiction
like
protagoras
he
is
described
as
of
a
generous
nature
he
expresses
his
approbation
of
socrates
manner
of
approaching
a
question
he
is
quite
of
socrates
sort
ready
to
be
refuted
as
well
as
to
refute
and
very
eager
that
callicles
and
socrates
should
have
the
game
out
he
knows
by
experience
that
rhetoric
exercises
great
influence
over
other
men
but
he
is
unable
to
explain
the
puzzle
how
rhetoric
can
teach
everything
and
know
nothing
polus
is
an
impetuous
youth
a
runaway
as
socrates
describes
him
who
wanted
originally
to
have
taken
the
place
of
gorgias
under
the
pretext
that
the
old
man
was
tired
and
now
avails
himself
of
the
earliest
opportunity
to
enter
the
lists
he
is
said
to
be
the
author
of
a
work
on
rhetoric
and
is
again
mentioned
in
the
phaedrus
as
the
inventor
of
balanced
or
double
forms
of
speech
compare
gorg
at
first
he
is
violent
and
and
is
angry
at
seeing
his
master
overthrown
but
in
the
judicious
hands
of
socrates
he
is
soon
restored
to
and
compelled
to
assent
to
the
required
conclusion
like
gorgias
he
is
overthrown
because
he
compromises
he
is
unwilling
to
say
that
to
do
is
fairer
or
more
honourable
than
to
suffer
injustice
though
he
is
fascinated
by
the
power
of
rhetoric
and
dazzled
by
the
splendour
of
success
he
is
not
insensible
to
higher
arguments
plato
may
have
felt
that
there
would
be
an
incongruity
in
a
youth
maintaining
the
cause
of
injustice
against
the
world
he
has
never
heard
the
other
side
of
the
question
and
he
listens
to
the
paradoxes
as
they
appear
to
him
of
socrates
with
evident
astonishment
he
can
hardly
understand
the
meaning
of
archelaus
being
miserable
or
of
rhetoric
being
only
useful
in
when
the
argument
with
him
has
fairly
run
out
callicles
in
whose
house
they
are
assembled
is
introduced
on
the
stage
he
is
with
difficulty
convinced
that
socrates
is
in
earnest
for
if
these
things
are
true
then
as
he
says
with
real
emotion
the
foundations
of
society
are
upside
down
in
him
another
type
of
character
is
represented
he
is
neither
sophist
nor
philosopher
but
man
of
the
world
and
an
accomplished
athenian
gentleman
he
might
be
described
in
modern
language
as
a
cynic
or
materialist
a
lover
of
power
and
also
of
pleasure
and
unscrupulous
in
his
means
of
attaining
both
there
is
no
desire
on
his
part
to
offer
any
compromise
in
the
interests
of
morality
nor
is
any
concession
made
by
him
like
thrasymachus
in
the
republic
though
he
is
not
of
the
same
weak
and
vulgar
class
he
consistently
maintains
that
might
is
right
his
great
motive
of
action
is
political
ambition
in
this
he
is
characteristically
greek
like
anytus
in
the
meno
he
is
the
enemy
of
the
sophists
but
favours
the
new
art
of
rhetoric
which
he
regards
as
an
excellent
weapon
of
attack
and
defence
he
is
a
despiser
of
mankind
as
he
is
of
philosophy
and
sees
in
the
laws
of
the
state
only
a
violation
of
the
order
of
nature
which
intended
that
the
stronger
should
govern
the
weaker
compare
republic
like
other
men
of
the
world
who
are
of
a
speculative
turn
of
mind
he
generalizes
the
bad
side
of
human
nature
and
has
easily
brought
down
his
principles
to
his
practice
philosophy
and
poetry
alike
supply
him
with
distinctions
suited
to
his
view
of
human
life
he
has
a
good
will
to
socrates
whose
talents
he
evidently
admires
while
he
censures
the
puerile
use
which
he
makes
of
them
he
expresses
a
keen
intellectual
interest
in
the
argument
like
anytus
again
he
has
a
sympathy
with
other
men
of
the
world
the
athenian
statesmen
of
a
former
generation
who
showed
no
weakness
and
made
no
mistakes
such
as
miltiades
themistocles
pericles
are
his
favourites
his
ideal
of
human
character
is
a
man
of
great
passions
and
great
powers
which
he
has
developed
to
the
utmost
and
which
he
uses
in
his
own
enjoyment
and
in
the
government
of
others
had
critias
been
the
name
instead
of
callicles
about
whom
we
know
nothing
from
other
sources
the
opinions
of
the
man
would
have
seemed
to
reflect
the
history
of
his
life
and
now
the
combat
deepens
in
callicles
far
more
than
in
any
sophist
or
rhetorician
is
concentrated
the
spirit
of
evil
against
which
socrates
is
contending
the
spirit
of
the
world
the
spirit
of
the
many
contending
against
the
one
wise
man
of
which
the
sophists
as
he
describes
them
in
the
republic
are
the
imitators
rather
than
the
authors
being
themselves
carried
away
by
the
great
tide
of
public
opinion
socrates
approaches
his
antagonist
warily
from
a
distance
with
a
sort
of
irony
which
touches
with
a
light
hand
both
his
personal
vices
probably
in
allusion
to
some
scandal
of
the
day
and
his
servility
to
the
populace
at
the
same
time
he
is
in
most
profound
earnest
as
chaerephon
remarks
callicles
soon
loses
his
temper
but
the
more
he
is
irritated
the
more
provoking
and
matter
of
fact
does
socrates
become
a
repartee
of
his
which
appears
to
have
been
really
made
to
the
hippias
according
to
the
testimony
of
xenophon
mem
is
introduced
he
is
called
by
callicles
a
popular
declaimer
and
certainly
shows
that
he
has
the
power
in
the
words
of
gorgias
of
being
long
as
he
pleases
or
short
as
he
pleases
compare
callicles
exhibits
great
ability
in
defending
himself
and
attacking
socrates
whom
he
accuses
of
trifling
and
he
is
scandalized
that
the
legitimate
consequences
of
his
own
argument
should
be
stated
in
plain
terms
after
the
manner
of
men
of
the
world
he
wishes
to
preserve
the
decencies
of
life
but
he
can
not
consistently
maintain
the
bad
sense
of
words
and
getting
confused
between
the
abstract
notions
of
better
superior
stronger
he
is
easily
turned
round
by
socrates
and
only
induced
to
continue
the
argument
by
the
authority
of
gorgias
once
when
socrates
is
describing
the
manner
in
which
the
ambitious
citizen
has
to
identify
himself
with
the
people
he
partially
recognizes
the
truth
of
his
words
the
socrates
of
the
gorgias
may
be
compared
with
the
socrates
of
the
protagoras
and
meno
as
in
other
dialogues
he
is
the
enemy
of
the
sophists
and
rhetoricians
and
also
of
the
statesmen
whom
he
regards
as
another
variety
of
the
same
species
his
behaviour
is
governed
by
that
of
his
opponents
the
least
forwardness
or
egotism
on
their
part
is
met
by
a
corresponding
irony
on
the
part
of
socrates
he
must
speak
for
philosophy
will
not
allow
him
to
be
silent
he
is
indeed
more
ironical
and
provoking
than
in
any
other
of
plato
writings
for
he
is
to
the
top
of
his
bent
by
the
worldliness
of
callicles
but
he
is
also
more
deeply
in
earnest
he
rises
higher
than
even
in
the
phaedo
and
crito
at
first
enveloping
his
moral
convictions
in
a
cloud
of
dust
and
dialectics
he
ends
by
losing
his
method
his
life
himself
in
them
as
in
the
protagoras
and
phaedrus
throwing
aside
the
veil
of
irony
he
makes
a
speech
but
true
to
his
character
not
until
his
adversary
has
refused
to
answer
any
more
questions
the
presentiment
of
his
own
fate
is
hanging
over
him
he
is
aware
that
socrates
the
single
real
teacher
of
politics
as
he
ventures
to
call
himself
can
not
safely
go
to
war
with
the
whole
world
and
that
in
the
courts
of
earth
he
will
be
condemned
but
he
will
be
justified
in
the
world
below
then
the
position
of
socrates
and
callicles
will
be
reversed
all
those
things
for
ears
polite
which
callicles
has
prophesied
as
likely
to
happen
to
him
in
this
life
the
insulting
language
the
box
on
the
ears
will
recoil
upon
his
assailant
compare
republic
and
the
similar
reversal
of
the
position
of
the
lawyer
and
the
philosopher
in
the
theaetetus
there
is
an
interesting
allusion
to
his
own
behaviour
at
the
trial
of
the
generals
after
the
battle
of
arginusae
which
he
ironically
attributes
to
his
ignorance
of
the
manner
in
which
a
vote
of
the
assembly
should
be
taken
this
is
said
to
have
happened
and
therefore
the
assumed
date
of
the
dialogue
has
been
fixed
at
when
socrates
would
already
have
been
an
old
man
the
date
is
clearly
marked
but
is
scarcely
reconcilable
with
another
indication
of
time
viz
the
usurpation
of
archelaus
which
occurred
in
the
year
and
still
less
with
the
death
of
pericles
who
really
died
years
previously
and
is
afterwards
reckoned
among
the
statesmen
of
a
past
age
or
with
the
mention
of
nicias
who
died
in
and
is
nevertheless
spoken
of
as
a
living
witness
but
we
shall
hereafter
have
reason
to
observe
that
although
there
is
a
general
consistency
of
times
and
persons
in
the
dialogues
of
plato
a
precise
dramatic
date
is
an
invention
of
his
commentators
preface
to
republic
the
conclusion
of
the
dialogue
is
remarkable
for
the
truly
characteristic
declaration
of
socrates
that
he
is
ignorant
of
the
true
nature
and
bearing
of
these
things
while
he
affirms
at
the
same
time
that
no
one
can
maintain
any
other
view
without
being
ridiculous
the
profession
of
ignorance
reminds
us
of
the
earlier
and
more
exclusively
socratic
dialogues
but
neither
in
them
nor
in
the
apology
nor
in
the
memorabilia
of
xenophon
does
socrates
express
any
doubt
of
the
fundamental
truths
of
morality
he
evidently
regards
this
the
multitude
of
questions
which
agitate
human
life
the
principle
which
alone
remains
unshaken
he
does
not
insist
here
any
more
than
in
the
phaedo
on
the
literal
truth
of
the
myth
but
only
on
the
soundness
of
the
doctrine
which
is
contained
in
it
that
doing
wrong
is
worse
than
suffering
and
that
a
man
should
be
rather
than
seem
for
the
next
best
thing
to
a
man
being
just
is
that
he
should
be
corrected
and
become
just
also
that
he
should
avoid
all
flattery
whether
of
himself
or
of
others
and
that
rhetoric
should
be
employed
for
the
maintenance
of
the
right
only
the
revelation
of
another
life
is
a
recapitulation
of
the
argument
in
a
figure
socrates
makes
the
singular
remark
that
he
is
himself
the
only
true
politician
of
his
age
in
other
passages
especially
in
the
apology
he
disclaims
being
a
politician
at
all
there
he
is
convinced
that
he
or
any
other
good
man
who
attempted
to
resist
the
popular
will
would
be
put
to
death
before
he
had
done
any
good
to
himself
or
others
here
he
anticipates
such
a
fate
for
himself
from
the
fact
that
he
is
only
man
of
the
present
day
who
performs
his
public
duties
at
all
the
two
points
of
view
are
not
really
inconsistent
but
the
difference
between
them
is
worth
noticing
socrates
is
and
is
not
a
public
man
not
in
the
ordinary
sense
like
alcibiades
or
pericles
but
in
a
higher
one
and
this
will
sooner
or
later
entail
the
same
consequences
on
him
he
can
not
be
a
private
man
if
he
would
neither
can
he
separate
morals
from
politics
nor
is
he
unwilling
to
be
a
politician
although
he
foresees
the
dangers
which
await
him
but
he
must
first
become
a
better
and
wiser
man
for
he
as
well
as
callicles
is
in
a
state
of
perplexity
and
uncertainty
and
yet
there
is
an
inconsistency
for
should
not
socrates
too
have
taught
the
citizens
better
than
to
put
him
to
death
and
now
as
he
himself
says
we
will
the
argument
from
the
beginning
socrates
who
is
attended
by
his
inseparable
disciple
chaerephon
meets
callicles
in
the
streets
of
athens
he
is
informed
that
he
has
just
missed
an
exhibition
of
gorgias
which
he
regrets
because
he
was
desirous
not
of
hearing
gorgias
display
his
rhetoric
but
of
interrogating
him
concerning
the
nature
of
his
art
callicles
proposes
that
they
shall
go
with
him
to
his
own
house
where
gorgias
is
staying
there
they
find
the
great
rhetorician
and
his
younger
friend
and
disciple
polus
socrates
put
the
question
to
him
chaerephon
chaerephon
what
question
socrates
who
is
he
such
a
question
as
would
elicit
from
a
man
the
answer
am
a
cobbler
polus
suggests
that
gorgias
may
be
tired
and
desires
to
answer
for
him
is
gorgias
asks
chaerephon
imitating
the
manner
of
his
master
socrates
of
the
best
of
men
and
a
proficient
in
the
best
and
noblest
of
experimental
arts
replies
polus
in
rhetorical
and
balanced
phrases
socrates
is
dissatisfied
at
the
length
and
unmeaningness
of
the
answer
he
tells
the
disconcerted
volunteer
that
he
has
mistaken
the
quality
for
the
nature
of
the
art
and
remarks
to
gorgias
that
polus
has
learnt
how
to
make
a
speech
but
not
how
to
answer
a
question
he
wishes
that
gorgias
would
answer
him
gorgias
is
willing
enough
and
replies
to
the
question
asked
by
chaerephon
that
he
is
a
rhetorician
and
in
homeric
language
himself
to
be
a
good
one
at
the
request
of
socrates
he
promises
to
be
brief
for
can
be
as
long
as
he
pleases
and
as
short
as
he
pleases
socrates
would
have
him
bestow
his
length
on
others
and
proceeds
to
ask
him
a
number
of
questions
which
are
answered
by
him
to
his
own
great
satisfaction
and
with
a
brevity
which
excites
the
admiration
of
socrates
the
result
of
the
discussion
may
be
summed
up
as
follows
rhetoric
treats
of
discourse
but
music
and
medicine
and
other
particular
arts
are
also
concerned
with
discourse
in
what
way
then
does
rhetoric
differ
from
them
gorgias
draws
a
distinction
between
the
arts
which
deal
with
words
and
the
arts
which
have
to
do
with
external
actions
socrates
extends
this
distinction
further
and
divides
all
productive
arts
into
two
classes
arts
which
may
be
carried
on
in
silence
and
arts
which
have
to
do
with
words
or
in
which
words
are
coextensive
with
action
such
as
arithmetic
geometry
rhetoric
but
still
gorgias
could
hardly
have
meant
to
say
that
arithmetic
was
the
same
as
rhetoric
even
in
the
arts
which
are
concerned
with
words
there
are
differences
what
then
distinguishes
rhetoric
from
the
other
arts
which
have
to
do
with
words
words
which
rhetoric
uses
relate
to
the
best
and
greatest
of
human
things
but
tell
me
gorgias
what
are
the
best
first
beauty
next
wealth
third
in
the
words
of
the
old
song
or
how
would
you
rank
them
the
arts
will
come
to
you
in
a
body
each
claiming
precedence
and
saying
that
her
own
good
is
superior
to
that
of
the
rest
how
will
you
choose
between
them
should
say
socrates
that
the
art
of
persuasion
which
gives
freedom
to
all
men
and
to
individuals
power
in
the
state
is
the
greatest
good
but
what
is
the
exact
nature
of
this
persuasion
is
the
persevering
retort
you
could
not
describe
zeuxis
as
a
painter
or
even
as
a
painter
of
figures
if
there
were
other
painters
of
figures
neither
can
you
define
rhetoric
simply
as
an
art
of
persuasion
because
there
are
other
arts
which
persuade
such
as
arithmetic
which
is
an
art
of
persuasion
about
odd
and
even
numbers
gorgias
is
made
to
see
the
necessity
of
a
further
limitation
and
he
now
defines
rhetoric
as
the
art
of
persuading
in
the
law
courts
and
in
the
assembly
about
the
just
and
unjust
but
still
there
are
two
sorts
of
persuasion
one
which
gives
knowledge
and
another
which
gives
belief
without
knowledge
and
knowledge
is
always
true
but
belief
may
be
either
true
or
false
there
is
therefore
a
further
question
which
of
the
two
sorts
of
persuasion
does
rhetoric
effect
in
courts
of
law
and
assemblies
plainly
that
which
gives
belief
and
not
that
which
gives
knowledge
for
no
one
can
impart
a
real
knowledge
of
such
matters
to
a
crowd
of
persons
in
a
few
minutes
and
there
is
another
point
to
be
considered
when
the
assembly
meets
to
advise
about
walls
or
docks
or
military
expeditions
the
rhetorician
is
not
taken
into
counsel
but
the
architect
or
the
general
how
would
gorgias
explain
this
phenomenon
all
who
intend
to
become
disciples
of
whom
there
are
several
in
the
company
and
not
socrates
only
are
eagerly
asking
about
what
then
will
rhetoric
teach
us
to
persuade
or
advise
the
state
gorgias
illustrates
the
nature
of
rhetoric
by
adducing
the
example
of
themistocles
who
persuaded
the
athenians
to
build
their
docks
and
walls
and
of
pericles
whom
socrates
himself
has
heard
speaking
about
the
middle
wall
of
the
piraeus
he
adds
that
he
has
exercised
a
similar
power
over
the
patients
of
his
brother
herodicus
he
could
be
chosen
a
physician
by
the
assembly
if
he
pleased
for
no
physician
could
compete
with
a
rhetorician
in
popularity
and
influence
he
could
persuade
the
multitude
of
anything
by
the
power
of
his
rhetoric
not
that
the
rhetorician
ought
to
abuse
this
power
any
more
than
a
boxer
should
abuse
the
art
of
rhetoric
is
a
good
thing
but
like
all
good
things
may
be
unlawfully
used
neither
is
the
teacher
of
the
art
to
be
deemed
unjust
because
his
pupils
are
unjust
and
make
a
bad
use
of
the
lessons
which
they
have
learned
from
him
socrates
would
like
to
know
before
he
replies
whether
gorgias
will
quarrel
with
him
if
he
points
out
a
slight
inconsistency
into
which
he
has
fallen
or
whether
he
like
himself
is
one
who
loves
to
be
refuted
gorgias
declares
that
he
is
quite
one
of
his
sort
but
fears
that
the
argument
may
be
tedious
to
the
company
the
company
cheer
and
chaerephon
and
callicles
exhort
them
to
proceed
socrates
gently
points
out
the
supposed
inconsistency
into
which
gorgias
appears
to
have
fallen
and
which
he
is
inclined
to
think
may
arise
out
of
a
misapprehension
of
his
own
the
rhetorician
has
been
declared
by
gorgias
to
be
more
persuasive
to
the
ignorant
than
the
physician
or
any
other
expert
and
he
is
said
to
be
ignorant
and
this
ignorance
of
his
is
regarded
by
gorgias
as
a
happy
condition
for
he
has
escaped
the
trouble
of
learning
but
is
he
as
ignorant
of
just
and
unjust
as
he
is
of
medicine
or
building
gorgias
is
compelled
to
admit
that
if
he
did
not
know
them
previously
he
must
learn
them
from
his
teacher
as
a
part
of
the
art
of
rhetoric
but
he
who
has
learned
carpentry
is
a
carpenter
and
he
who
has
learned
music
is
a
musician
and
he
who
has
learned
justice
is
just
the
rhetorician
then
must
be
a
just
man
and
rhetoric
is
a
just
thing
but
gorgias
has
already
admitted
the
opposite
of
this
viz
that
rhetoric
may
be
abused
and
that
the
rhetorician
may
act
unjustly
how
is
the
inconsistency
to
be
explained
the
fallacy
of
this
argument
is
twofold
for
in
the
first
place
a
man
may
know
justice
and
not
be
just
here
is
the
old
confusion
of
the
arts
and
the
virtues
nor
can
any
teacher
be
expected
to
counteract
wholly
the
bent
of
natural
character
and
secondly
a
man
may
have
a
degree
of
justice
but
not
sufficient
to
prevent
him
from
ever
doing
wrong
polus
is
naturally
exasperated
at
the
sophism
which
he
is
unable
to
detect
of
course
he
says
the
rhetorician
like
every
one
else
will
admit
that
he
knows
justice
how
can
he
do
otherwise
when
pressed
by
the
interrogations
of
socrates
but
he
thinks
that
great
want
of
manners
is
shown
in
bringing
the
argument
to
such
a
pass
socrates
ironically
replies
that
when
old
men
trip
the
young
set
them
on
their
legs
again
and
he
is
quite
willing
to
retract
if
he
can
be
shown
to
be
in
error
but
upon
one
condition
which
is
that
polus
studies
brevity
polus
is
in
great
indignation
at
not
being
allowed
to
use
as
many
words
as
he
pleases
in
the
free
state
of
athens
socrates
retorts
that
yet
harder
will
be
his
own
case
if
he
is
compelled
to
stay
and
listen
to
them
after
some
altercation
they
agree
compare
protag
that
polus
shall
ask
and
socrates
answer
is
the
art
of
rhetoric
says
polus
not
an
art
at
all
replies
socrates
but
a
thing
which
in
your
book
you
affirm
to
have
created
art
polus
asks
thing
and
socrates
answers
an
experience
or
routine
of
making
a
sort
of
delight
or
gratification
is
not
rhetoric
a
fine
thing
i
have
not
yet
told
you
what
rhetoric
is
will
you
ask
me
another
question
what
is
cookery
is
cookery
an
experience
or
routine
of
making
a
sort
of
delight
or
gratification
then
they
are
the
same
or
rather
fall
under
the
same
class
and
rhetoric
has
still
to
be
distinguished
from
cookery
is
rhetoric
asks
polus
once
more
a
part
of
a
not
very
creditable
whole
which
may
be
termed
flattery
is
the
reply
what
part
a
shadow
of
a
part
of
politics
this
as
might
be
expected
is
wholly
unintelligible
both
to
gorgias
and
polus
and
in
order
to
explain
his
meaning
to
them
socrates
draws
a
distinction
between
shadows
or
appearances
and
realities
there
is
real
health
of
body
or
soul
and
the
appearance
of
them
real
arts
and
sciences
and
the
simulations
of
them
now
the
soul
and
body
have
two
arts
waiting
upon
them
first
the
art
of
politics
which
attends
on
the
soul
having
a
legislative
part
and
a
judicial
part
and
another
art
attending
on
the
body
which
has
no
generic
name
but
may
also
be
described
as
having
two
divisions
one
of
which
is
medicine
and
the
other
gymnastic
corresponding
with
these
four
arts
or
sciences
there
are
four
shams
or
simulations
of
them
mere
experiences
as
they
may
be
termed
because
they
give
no
reason
of
their
own
existence
the
art
of
dressing
up
is
the
sham
or
simulation
of
gymnastic
the
art
of
cookery
of
medicine
rhetoric
is
the
simulation
of
justice
and
sophistic
of
legislation
they
may
be
summed
up
in
an
arithmetical
formula
tiring
gymnastic
cookery
medicine
sophistic
legislation
and
cookery
medicine
rhetoric
the
art
of
justice
and
this
is
the
true
scheme
of
them
but
when
measured
only
by
the
gratification
which
they
procure
they
become
jumbled
together
and
return
to
their
aboriginal
chaos
socrates
apologizes
for
the
length
of
his
speech
which
was
necessary
to
the
explanation
of
the
subject
and
begs
polus
not
unnecessarily
to
retaliate
on
him
you
mean
to
say
that
the
rhetoricians
are
esteemed
flatterers
they
are
not
esteemed
at
all
have
they
not
great
power
and
can
they
not
do
whatever
they
desire
they
have
no
power
and
they
only
do
what
they
think
best
and
never
what
they
desire
for
they
never
attain
the
true
object
of
desire
which
is
the
good
if
you
socrates
would
not
envy
the
possessor
of
despotic
power
who
can
imprison
exile
kill
any
one
whom
he
pleases
but
socrates
replies
that
he
has
no
wish
to
put
any
one
to
death
he
who
kills
another
even
justly
is
not
to
be
envied
and
he
who
kills
him
unjustly
is
to
be
pitied
it
is
better
to
suffer
than
to
do
injustice
he
does
not
consider
that
going
about
with
a
dagger
and
putting
men
out
of
the
way
or
setting
a
house
on
fire
is
real
power
to
this
polus
assents
on
the
ground
that
such
acts
would
be
punished
but
he
is
still
of
opinion
that
if
they
are
unpunished
may
be
happy
enough
he
instances
archelaus
son
of
perdiccas
the
usurper
of
macedonia
does
not
socrates
think
him
happy
socrates
would
like
to
know
more
about
him
he
can
not
pronounce
even
the
great
king
to
be
happy
unless
he
knows
his
mental
and
moral
condition
polus
explains
that
archelaus
was
a
slave
being
the
son
of
a
woman
who
was
the
slave
of
alcetas
brother
of
perdiccas
king
of
macedon
and
he
by
every
species
of
crime
first
murdering
his
uncle
and
then
his
cousin
and
obtained
the
kingdom
this
was
very
wicked
and
yet
all
the
world
including
socrates
would
like
to
have
his
place
socrates
dismisses
the
appeal
to
numbers
polus
if
he
will
may
summon
all
the
rich
men
of
athens
nicias
and
his
brothers
aristocrates
the
house
of
pericles
or
any
other
great
family
this
is
the
kind
of
evidence
which
is
adduced
in
courts
of
justice
where
truth
depends
upon
numbers
but
socrates
employs
proof
of
another
sort
his
appeal
is
to
one
witness
only
that
is
to
say
the
person
with
whom
he
is
speaking
him
he
will
convict
out
of
his
own
mouth
and
he
is
prepared
to
show
after
his
manner
that
archelaus
can
not
be
a
wicked
man
and
yet
happy
the
is
deemed
happy
if
he
escapes
and
miserable
if
he
suffers
punishment
but
socrates
thinks
him
less
miserable
if
he
suffers
than
if
he
escapes
polus
is
of
opinion
that
such
a
paradox
as
this
hardly
deserves
refutation
and
is
at
any
rate
sufficiently
refuted
by
the
fact
socrates
has
only
to
compare
the
lot
of
the
successful
tyrant
who
is
the
envy
of
the
world
and
of
the
wretch
who
having
been
detected
in
a
criminal
attempt
against
the
state
is
crucified
or
burnt
to
death
socrates
replies
that
if
they
are
both
criminal
they
are
both
miserable
but
that
the
unpunished
is
the
more
miserable
of
the
two
at
this
polus
laughs
outright
which
leads
socrates
to
remark
that
laughter
is
a
new
species
of
refutation
polus
replies
that
he
is
already
refuted
for
if
he
will
take
the
votes
of
the
company
he
will
find
that
no
one
agrees
with
him
to
this
socrates
rejoins
that
he
is
not
a
public
man
and
referring
to
his
own
conduct
at
the
trial
of
the
generals
after
the
battle
of
arginusae
is
unable
to
take
the
suffrages
of
any
company
as
he
had
shown
on
a
recent
occasion
he
can
only
deal
with
one
witness
at
a
time
and
that
is
the
person
with
whom
he
is
arguing
but
he
is
certain
that
in
the
opinion
of
any
man
to
do
is
worse
than
to
suffer
evil
polus
though
he
will
not
admit
this
is
ready
to
acknowledge
that
to
do
evil
is
considered
the
more
foul
or
dishonourable
of
the
two
but
what
is
fair
and
what
is
foul
whether
the
terms
are
applied
to
bodies
colours
figures
laws
habits
studies
must
they
not
be
defined
with
reference
to
pleasure
and
utility
polus
assents
to
this
latter
doctrine
and
is
easily
persuaded
that
the
fouler
of
two
things
must
exceed
either
in
pain
or
in
hurt
but
the
doing
can
not
exceed
the
suffering
of
evil
in
pain
and
therefore
must
exceed
in
hurt
thus
doing
is
proved
by
the
testimony
of
polus
himself
to
be
worse
or
more
hurtful
than
suffering
there
remains
the
other
question
is
a
guilty
man
better
off
when
he
is
punished
or
when
he
is
unpunished
socrates
replies
that
what
is
done
justly
is
suffered
justly
if
the
act
is
just
the
effect
is
just
if
to
punish
is
just
to
be
punished
is
just
and
therefore
fair
and
therefore
beneficent
and
the
benefit
is
that
the
soul
is
improved
there
are
three
evils
from
which
a
man
may
suffer
and
which
affect
him
in
estate
body
and
soul
these
are
poverty
disease
injustice
and
the
foulest
of
these
is
injustice
the
evil
of
the
soul
because
that
brings
the
greatest
hurt
and
there
are
three
arts
which
heal
these
evils
trading
medicine
justice
and
the
fairest
of
these
is
justice
happy
is
he
who
has
never
committed
injustice
and
happy
in
the
second
degree
he
who
has
been
healed
by
punishment
and
therefore
the
criminal
should
himself
go
to
the
judge
as
he
would
to
the
physician
and
purge
away
his
crime
rhetoric
will
enable
him
to
display
his
guilt
in
proper
colours
and
to
sustain
himself
and
others
in
enduring
the
necessary
penalty
and
similarly
if
a
man
has
an
enemy
he
will
desire
not
to
punish
him
but
that
he
shall
go
unpunished
and
become
worse
and
worse
taking
care
only
that
he
does
no
injury
to
himself
these
are
at
least
conceivable
uses
of
the
art
and
no
others
have
been
discovered
by
us
here
callicles
who
has
been
listening
in
silent
amazement
asks
chaerephon
whether
socrates
is
in
earnest
and
on
receiving
the
assurance
that
he
is
proceeds
to
ask
the
same
question
of
socrates
himself
for
if
such
doctrines
are
true
life
must
have
been
turned
upside
down
and
all
of
us
are
doing
the
opposite
of
what
we
ought
to
be
doing
socrates
replies
in
a
style
of
playful
irony
that
before
men
can
understand
one
another
they
must
have
some
common
feeling
and
such
a
community
of
feeling
exists
between
himself
and
callicles
for
both
of
them
are
lovers
and
they
have
both
a
pair
of
loves
the
beloved
of
callicles
are
the
athenian
demos
and
demos
the
son
of
pyrilampes
the
beloved
of
socrates
are
alcibiades
and
philosophy
the
peculiarity
of
callicles
is
that
he
can
never
contradict
his
loves
he
changes
as
his
demos
changes
in
all
his
opinions
he
watches
the
countenance
of
both
his
loves
and
repeats
their
sentiments
and
if
any
one
is
surprised
at
his
sayings
and
doings
the
explanation
of
them
is
that
he
is
not
a
free
agent
but
must
always
be
imitating
his
two
loves
and
this
is
the
explanation
of
socrates
peculiarities
also
he
is
always
repeating
what
his
mistress
philosophy
is
saying
to
him
who
unlike
his
other
love
alcibiades
is
ever
the
same
ever
true
callicles
must
refute
her
or
he
will
never
be
at
unity
with
himself
and
discord
in
life
is
far
worse
than
the
discord
of
musical
sounds
callicles
answers
that
gorgias
was
overthrown
because
as
polus
said
in
compliance
with
popular
prejudice
he
had
admitted
that
if
his
pupil
did
not
know
justice
the
rhetorician
must
teach
him
and
polus
has
been
similarly
entangled
because
his
modesty
led
him
to
admit
that
to
suffer
is
more
honourable
than
to
do
injustice
by
custom
but
not
by
nature
says
callicles
and
socrates
is
always
playing
between
the
two
points
of
view
and
putting
one
in
the
place
of
the
other
in
this
very
argument
what
polus
only
meant
in
a
conventional
sense
has
been
affirmed
by
him
to
be
a
law
of
nature
for
convention
says
that
is
dishonourable
but
nature
says
that
is
right
and
we
are
always
taming
down
the
nobler
spirits
among
us
to
the
conventional
level
but
sometimes
a
great
man
will
rise
up
and
reassert
his
original
rights
trampling
under
foot
all
our
formularies
and
then
the
light
of
natural
justice
shines
forth
pindar
says
the
king
of
all
does
violence
with
high
hand
as
is
indeed
proved
by
the
example
of
heracles
who
drove
off
the
oxen
of
geryon
and
never
paid
for
them
this
is
the
truth
socrates
as
you
will
be
convinced
if
you
leave
philosophy
and
pass
on
to
the
real
business
of
life
a
little
philosophy
is
an
excellent
thing
too
much
is
the
ruin
of
a
man
he
who
has
not
his
metaphysics
before
he
has
grown
up
to
manhood
will
never
know
the
world
philosophers
are
ridiculous
when
they
take
to
politics
and
i
dare
say
that
politicians
are
equally
ridiculous
when
they
take
to
philosophy
man
as
euripides
says
fondest
of
that
in
which
he
is
best
philosophy
is
graceful
in
youth
like
the
lisp
of
infancy
and
should
be
cultivated
as
a
part
of
education
but
when
a
man
lisps
or
studies
philosophy
i
should
like
to
beat
him
none
of
those
natures
ever
come
to
any
good
they
avoid
the
busy
haunts
of
men
and
skulk
in
corners
whispering
to
a
few
admiring
youths
and
never
giving
utterance
to
any
noble
sentiments
for
you
socrates
i
have
a
regard
and
therefore
i
say
to
you
as
zethus
says
to
amphion
in
the
play
that
you
have
noble
soul
disguised
in
a
puerile
exterior
and
i
would
have
you
consider
the
danger
which
you
and
other
philosophers
incur
for
you
would
not
know
how
to
defend
yourself
if
any
one
accused
you
in
a
there
you
would
stand
with
gaping
mouth
and
dizzy
brain
and
might
be
murdered
robbed
boxed
on
the
ears
with
impunity
take
my
advice
then
and
get
a
little
common
sense
leave
to
others
these
frivolities
walk
in
the
ways
of
the
wealthy
and
be
wise
socrates
professes
to
have
found
in
callicles
the
touchstone
and
he
is
certain
that
any
opinion
in
which
they
both
agree
must
be
the
very
truth
callicles
has
all
the
three
qualities
which
are
needed
in
a
critic
knowledge
frankness
gorgias
and
polus
although
learned
men
were
too
modest
and
their
modesty
made
them
contradict
themselves
but
callicles
is
and
he
is
not
too
modest
to
speak
out
of
this
he
has
already
given
proof
and
his
is
shown
both
by
his
own
profession
and
by
his
giving
the
same
caution
against
philosophy
to
socrates
which
socrates
remembers
hearing
him
give
long
ago
to
his
own
clique
of
friends
he
will
pledge
himself
to
retract
any
error
into
which
he
may
have
fallen
and
which
callicles
may
point
out
but
he
would
like
to
know
first
of
all
what
he
and
pindar
mean
by
natural
justice
do
they
suppose
that
the
rule
of
justice
is
the
rule
of
the
stronger
or
of
the
better
is
no
difference
then
are
not
the
many
superior
to
the
one
and
the
opinions
of
the
many
better
and
their
opinion
is
that
justice
is
equality
and
that
to
do
is
more
dishonourable
than
to
suffer
wrong
and
as
they
are
the
superior
or
stronger
this
opinion
of
theirs
must
be
in
accordance
with
natural
as
well
as
conventional
justice
will
you
continue
splitting
words
have
i
not
told
you
that
the
superior
is
the
better
but
what
do
you
mean
by
the
better
tell
me
that
and
please
to
be
a
little
milder
in
your
language
if
you
do
not
wish
to
drive
me
away
mean
the
worthier
the
wiser
you
mean
to
say
that
one
man
of
sense
ought
to
rule
over
ten
thousand
fools
that
is
my
meaning
ought
the
physician
then
to
have
a
larger
share
of
meats
and
drinks
or
the
weaver
to
have
more
coats
or
the
cobbler
larger
shoes
or
the
farmer
more
seed
are
always
saying
the
same
things
socrates
yes
and
on
the
same
subjects
too
but
you
are
never
saying
the
same
things
for
first
you
defined
the
superior
to
be
the
stronger
and
then
the
wiser
and
now
something
else
what
do
you
mean
mean
men
of
political
ability
who
ought
to
govern
and
to
have
more
than
the
governed
than
themselves
do
you
mean
i
mean
to
say
that
every
man
is
his
own
governor
see
that
you
mean
those
dolts
the
temperate
but
my
doctrine
is
that
a
man
should
let
his
desires
grow
and
take
the
means
of
satisfying
them
to
the
many
this
is
impossible
and
therefore
they
combine
to
prevent
him
but
if
he
is
a
king
and
has
power
how
base
would
he
be
in
submitting
to
them
to
invite
the
common
herd
to
be
lord
over
him
when
he
might
have
the
enjoyment
of
all
things
for
the
truth
is
socrates
that
luxury
and
are
virtue
and
happiness
all
the
rest
is
mere
talk
socrates
compliments
callicles
on
his
frankness
in
saying
what
other
men
only
think
according
to
his
view
those
who
want
nothing
are
not
happy
says
callicles
they
were
stones
and
the
dead
would
be
happy
socrates
in
reply
is
led
into
a
vein
of
reflection
knows
as
euripides
says
life
may
not
be
death
and
death
life
nay
there
are
philosophers
who
maintain
that
even
in
life
we
are
dead
and
that
the
body
soma
is
the
tomb
sema
of
the
soul
and
some
ingenious
sicilian
has
made
an
allegory
in
which
he
represents
fools
as
the
uninitiated
who
are
supposed
to
be
carrying
water
to
a
vessel
which
is
full
of
holes
in
a
similarly
holey
sieve
and
this
sieve
is
their
own
soul
the
idea
is
fanciful
but
nevertheless
is
a
figure
of
a
truth
which
i
want
to
make
you
acknowledge
viz
that
the
life
of
contentment
is
better
than
the
life
of
indulgence
are
you
disposed
to
admit
that
otherwise
then
hear
another
parable
the
life
of
and
may
be
represented
respectively
by
two
men
who
are
filling
jars
with
streams
of
wine
honey
milk
the
jars
of
the
one
are
sound
and
the
jars
of
the
other
leaky
the
first
fils
his
jars
and
has
no
more
trouble
with
them
the
second
is
always
filling
them
and
would
suffer
extreme
misery
if
he
desisted
are
you
of
the
same
opinion
still
socrates
and
the
figure
expresses
what
i
mean
for
true
pleasure
is
a
perpetual
stream
flowing
in
and
flowing
out
to
be
hungry
and
always
eating
to
be
thirsty
and
always
drinking
and
to
have
all
the
other
desires
and
to
satisfy
them
that
as
i
admit
is
my
idea
of
happiness
and
to
be
itching
and
always
scratching
do
not
deny
that
there
may
be
happiness
even
in
that
and
to
indulge
unnatural
desires
if
they
are
abundantly
satisfied
callicles
is
indignant
at
the
introduction
of
such
topics
but
he
is
reminded
by
socrates
that
they
are
introduced
not
by
him
but
by
the
maintainer
of
the
identity
of
pleasure
and
good
will
callicles
still
maintain
this
for
the
sake
of
consistency
he
will
the
answer
does
not
satisfy
socrates
who
fears
that
he
is
losing
his
touchstone
a
profession
of
seriousness
on
the
part
of
callicles
reassures
him
and
they
proceed
with
the
argument
pleasure
and
good
are
the
same
but
knowledge
and
courage
are
not
the
same
either
with
pleasure
or
good
or
with
one
another
socrates
disproves
the
first
of
these
statements
by
showing
that
two
opposites
can
not
coexist
but
must
alternate
with
one
another
to
be
well
and
ill
together
is
impossible
but
pleasure
and
pain
are
simultaneous
and
the
cessation
of
them
is
simultaneous
in
the
case
of
drinking
and
thirsting
whereas
good
and
evil
are
not
simultaneous
and
do
not
cease
simultaneously
and
therefore
pleasure
can
not
be
the
same
as
good
callicles
has
already
lost
his
temper
and
can
only
be
persuaded
to
go
on
by
the
interposition
of
gorgias
socrates
having
already
guarded
against
objections
by
distinguishing
courage
and
knowledge
from
pleasure
and
good
proceeds
the
good
are
good
by
the
presence
of
good
and
the
bad
are
bad
by
the
presence
of
evil
and
the
brave
and
wise
are
good
and
the
cowardly
and
foolish
are
bad
and
he
who
feels
pleasure
is
good
and
he
who
feels
pain
is
bad
and
both
feel
pleasure
and
pain
in
nearly
the
same
degree
and
sometimes
the
bad
man
or
coward
in
a
greater
degree
therefore
the
bad
man
or
coward
is
as
good
as
the
brave
or
may
be
even
better
callicles
endeavours
now
to
avert
the
inevitable
absurdity
by
affirming
that
he
and
all
mankind
admitted
some
pleasures
to
be
good
and
others
bad
the
good
are
the
beneficial
and
the
bad
are
the
hurtful
and
we
should
choose
the
one
and
avoid
the
other
but
this
as
socrates
observes
is
a
return
to
the
old
doctrine
of
himself
and
polus
that
all
things
should
be
done
for
the
sake
of
the
good
callicles
assents
to
this
and
socrates
finding
that
they
are
agreed
in
distinguishing
pleasure
from
good
returns
to
his
old
division
of
empirical
habits
or
shams
or
flatteries
which
study
pleasure
only
and
the
arts
which
are
concerned
with
the
higher
interests
of
soul
and
body
does
callicles
agree
to
this
division
callicles
will
agree
to
anything
in
order
that
he
may
get
through
the
argument
which
of
the
arts
then
are
flatteries
choral
exhibitions
the
dithyrambics
of
cinesias
are
all
equally
condemned
on
the
ground
that
they
give
pleasure
only
and
meles
the
who
was
the
father
of
cinesias
failed
even
in
that
the
stately
muse
of
tragedy
is
bent
upon
pleasure
and
not
upon
improvement
poetry
in
general
is
only
a
rhetorical
address
to
a
mixed
audience
of
men
women
and
children
and
the
orators
are
very
far
from
speaking
with
a
view
to
what
is
best
their
way
is
to
humour
the
assembly
as
if
they
were
children
callicles
replies
that
this
is
only
true
of
some
of
them
others
have
a
real
regard
for
their
granted
then
there
are
two
species
of
oratory
the
one
a
flattery
another
which
has
a
real
regard
for
the
citizens
but
where
are
the
orators
among
whom
you
find
the
latter
callicles
admits
that
there
are
none
remaining
but
there
were
such
in
the
days
when
themistocles
cimon
miltiades
and
the
great
pericles
were
still
alive
socrates
replies
that
none
of
these
were
true
artists
setting
before
themselves
the
duty
of
bringing
order
out
of
disorder
the
good
man
and
true
orator
has
a
settled
design
running
through
his
life
to
which
he
conforms
all
his
words
and
actions
he
desires
to
implant
justice
and
eradicate
injustice
to
implant
all
virtue
and
eradicate
all
vice
in
the
minds
of
his
citizens
he
is
the
physician
who
will
not
allow
the
sick
man
to
indulge
his
appetites
with
a
variety
of
meats
and
drinks
but
insists
on
his
exercising
and
this
is
good
for
the
soul
and
better
than
the
unrestrained
indulgence
which
callicles
was
recently
approving
here
callicles
who
had
been
with
difficulty
brought
to
this
point
turns
restive
and
suggests
that
socrates
shall
answer
his
own
questions
says
socrates
man
must
do
for
two
and
though
he
had
hoped
to
have
given
callicles
an
in
return
for
his
he
is
willing
to
proceed
at
the
same
time
he
hopes
that
callicles
will
correct
him
if
he
falls
into
error
he
recapitulates
the
advantages
which
he
has
already
won
the
pleasant
is
not
the
same
as
the
good
callicles
and
i
are
agreed
about
that
but
pleasure
is
to
be
pursued
for
the
sake
of
the
good
and
the
good
is
that
of
which
the
presence
makes
us
good
we
and
all
things
good
have
acquired
some
virtue
or
other
and
virtue
whether
of
body
or
soul
of
things
or
persons
is
not
attained
by
accident
but
is
due
to
order
and
harmonious
arrangement
and
the
soul
which
has
order
is
better
than
the
soul
which
is
without
order
and
is
therefore
temperate
and
is
therefore
good
and
the
intemperate
is
bad
and
he
who
is
temperate
is
also
just
and
brave
and
pious
and
has
attained
the
perfection
of
goodness
and
therefore
of
happiness
and
the
intemperate
whom
you
approve
is
the
opposite
of
all
this
and
is
wretched
he
therefore
who
would
be
happy
must
pursue
temperance
and
avoid
intemperance
and
if
possible
escape
the
necessity
of
punishment
but
if
he
have
done
wrong
he
must
endure
punishment
in
this
way
states
and
individuals
should
seek
to
attain
harmony
which
as
the
wise
tell
us
is
the
bond
of
heaven
and
earth
of
gods
and
men
callicles
has
never
discovered
the
power
of
geometrical
proportion
in
both
worlds
he
would
have
men
aim
at
disproportion
and
excess
but
if
he
be
wrong
in
this
and
if
is
the
true
secret
of
happiness
then
the
paradox
is
true
that
the
only
use
of
rhetoric
is
in
and
polus
was
right
in
saying
that
to
do
wrong
is
worse
than
to
suffer
wrong
and
gorgias
was
right
in
saying
that
the
rhetorician
must
be
a
just
man
and
you
were
wrong
in
taunting
me
with
my
defenceless
condition
and
in
saying
that
i
might
be
accused
or
put
to
death
or
boxed
on
the
ears
with
impunity
for
i
may
repeat
once
more
that
to
strike
is
worse
than
to
be
stricken
to
do
than
to
suffer
what
i
said
then
is
now
made
fast
in
adamantine
bonds
i
myself
know
not
the
true
nature
of
these
things
but
i
know
that
no
one
can
deny
my
words
and
not
be
ridiculous
to
do
wrong
is
the
greatest
of
evils
and
to
suffer
wrong
is
the
next
greatest
evil
he
who
would
avoid
the
last
must
be
a
ruler
or
the
friend
of
a
ruler
and
to
be
the
friend
he
must
be
the
equal
of
the
ruler
and
must
also
resemble
him
under
his
protection
he
will
suffer
no
evil
but
will
he
also
do
no
evil
nay
will
he
not
rather
do
all
the
evil
which
he
can
and
escape
and
in
this
way
the
greatest
of
all
evils
will
befall
him
this
imitator
of
the
tyrant
rejoins
callicles
kill
any
one
who
does
not
similarly
imitate
him
socrates
replies
that
he
is
not
deaf
and
that
he
has
heard
that
repeated
many
times
and
can
only
reply
that
a
bad
man
will
kill
a
good
one
and
that
is
the
provoking
thing
not
provoking
to
a
man
of
sense
who
is
not
studying
the
arts
which
will
preserve
him
from
danger
and
this
as
you
say
is
the
use
of
rhetoric
in
courts
of
justice
but
how
many
other
arts
are
there
which
also
save
men
from
death
and
are
yet
quite
humble
in
their
pretensions
such
as
the
art
of
swimming
or
the
art
of
the
pilot
does
not
the
pilot
do
men
at
least
as
much
service
as
the
rhetorician
and
yet
for
the
voyage
from
aegina
to
athens
he
does
not
charge
more
than
two
obols
and
when
he
disembarks
is
quite
unassuming
in
his
demeanour
the
reason
is
that
he
is
not
certain
whether
he
has
done
his
passengers
any
good
in
saving
them
from
death
if
one
of
them
is
diseased
in
body
and
still
more
if
he
is
diseased
in
mind
who
can
say
the
engineer
too
will
often
save
whole
cities
and
yet
you
despise
him
and
would
not
allow
your
son
to
marry
his
daughter
or
his
son
to
marry
yours
but
what
reason
is
there
in
this
for
if
virtue
only
means
the
saving
of
life
whether
your
own
or
another
you
have
no
right
to
despise
him
or
any
practiser
of
saving
arts
but
is
not
virtue
something
different
from
saving
and
being
saved
i
would
have
you
rather
consider
whether
you
ought
not
to
disregard
length
of
life
and
think
only
how
you
can
live
best
leaving
all
besides
to
the
will
of
heaven
for
you
must
not
expect
to
have
influence
either
with
the
athenian
demos
or
with
demos
the
son
of
pyrilampes
unless
you
become
like
them
what
do
you
say
to
this
is
some
truth
in
what
you
are
saying
but
i
do
not
entirely
believe
you
that
is
because
you
are
in
love
with
demos
but
let
us
have
a
little
more
conversation
you
remember
the
two
processes
one
which
was
directed
to
pleasure
the
other
which
was
directed
to
making
men
as
good
as
possible
and
those
who
have
the
care
of
the
city
should
make
the
citizens
as
good
as
possible
but
who
would
undertake
a
public
building
if
he
had
never
had
a
teacher
of
the
art
of
building
and
had
never
constructed
a
building
before
or
who
would
undertake
the
duty
of
if
he
had
never
cured
either
himself
or
any
one
else
should
we
not
examine
him
before
we
entrusted
him
with
the
office
and
as
callicles
is
about
to
enter
public
life
should
we
not
examine
him
whom
has
he
made
better
for
we
have
already
admitted
that
this
is
the
statesman
proper
business
and
we
must
ask
the
same
question
about
pericles
and
cimon
and
miltiades
and
themistocles
whom
did
they
make
better
nay
did
not
pericles
make
the
citizens
worse
for
he
gave
them
pay
and
at
first
he
was
very
popular
with
them
but
at
last
they
condemned
him
to
death
yet
surely
he
would
be
a
bad
tamer
of
animals
who
having
received
them
gentle
taught
them
to
kick
and
butt
and
man
is
an
animal
and
pericles
who
had
the
charge
of
man
only
made
him
wilder
and
more
savage
and
unjust
and
therefore
he
could
not
have
been
a
good
statesman
the
same
tale
might
be
repeated
about
cimon
themistocles
miltiades
but
the
charioteer
who
keeps
his
seat
at
first
is
not
thrown
out
when
he
gains
greater
experience
and
skill
the
inference
is
that
the
statesman
of
a
past
age
were
no
better
than
those
of
our
own
they
may
have
been
cleverer
constructors
of
docks
and
harbours
but
they
did
not
improve
the
character
of
the
citizens
i
have
told
you
again
and
again
and
i
purposely
use
the
same
images
that
the
soul
like
the
body
may
be
treated
in
two
ways
there
is
the
meaner
and
the
higher
art
you
seemed
to
understand
what
i
said
at
the
time
but
when
i
ask
you
who
were
the
really
good
statesmen
you
answer
as
if
i
asked
you
who
were
the
good
trainers
and
you
answered
thearion
the
baker
mithoecus
the
author
of
the
sicilian
sarambus
the
vintner
and
you
would
be
affronted
if
i
told
you
that
these
are
a
parcel
of
cooks
who
make
men
fat
only
to
make
them
thin
and
those
whom
they
have
fattened
applaud
them
instead
of
finding
fault
with
them
and
lay
the
blame
of
their
subsequent
disorders
on
their
physicians
in
this
respect
callicles
you
are
like
them
you
applaud
the
statesmen
of
old
who
pandered
to
the
vices
of
the
citizens
and
filled
the
city
with
docks
and
harbours
but
neglected
virtue
and
justice
and
when
the
fit
of
illness
comes
the
citizens
who
in
like
manner
applauded
themistocles
pericles
and
others
will
lay
hold
of
you
and
my
friend
alcibiades
and
you
will
suffer
for
the
misdeeds
of
your
predecessors
the
old
story
is
always
being
repeated
all
his
services
the
ungrateful
city
banished
him
or
condemned
him
to
death
as
if
the
statesman
should
not
have
taught
the
city
better
he
surely
can
not
blame
the
state
for
having
unjustly
used
him
any
more
than
the
sophist
or
teacher
can
find
fault
with
his
pupils
if
they
cheat
him
and
the
sophist
and
orator
are
in
the
same
case
although
you
admire
rhetoric
and
despise
sophistic
whereas
sophistic
is
really
the
higher
of
the
two
the
teacher
of
the
arts
takes
money
but
the
teacher
of
virtue
or
politics
takes
no
money
because
this
is
the
only
kind
of
service
which
makes
the
disciple
desirous
of
requiting
his
teacher
socrates
concludes
by
finally
asking
to
which
of
the
two
modes
of
serving
the
state
callicles
invites
him
the
inferior
and
ministerial
one
is
the
ingenuous
reply
that
is
the
only
way
of
avoiding
death
replies
socrates
and
he
has
heard
often
enough
and
would
rather
not
hear
again
that
the
bad
man
will
kill
the
good
but
he
thinks
that
such
a
fate
is
very
likely
reserved
for
him
because
he
remarks
that
he
is
the
only
person
who
teaches
the
true
art
of
politics
and
very
probably
as
in
the
case
which
he
described
to
polus
he
may
be
the
physician
who
is
tried
by
a
jury
of
children
he
can
not
say
that
he
has
procured
the
citizens
any
pleasure
and
if
any
one
charges
him
with
perplexing
them
or
with
reviling
their
elders
he
will
not
be
able
to
make
them
understand
that
he
has
only
been
actuated
by
a
desire
for
their
good
and
therefore
there
is
no
saying
what
his
fate
may
be
do
you
think
that
a
man
who
is
unable
to
help
himself
is
in
a
good
condition
yes
callicles
if
he
have
the
true
which
is
never
to
have
said
or
done
any
wrong
to
himself
or
others
if
i
had
not
this
kind
of
i
should
be
ashamed
but
if
i
die
for
want
of
your
flattering
rhetoric
i
shall
die
in
peace
for
death
is
no
evil
but
to
go
to
the
world
below
laden
with
offences
is
the
worst
of
evils
in
proof
of
which
i
will
tell
you
a
tale
under
the
rule
of
cronos
men
were
judged
on
the
day
of
their
death
and
when
judgment
had
been
given
upon
them
they
departed
the
good
to
the
islands
of
the
blest
the
bad
to
the
house
of
vengeance
but
as
they
were
still
living
and
had
their
clothes
on
at
the
time
when
they
were
being
judged
there
was
favouritism
and
zeus
when
he
came
to
the
throne
was
obliged
to
alter
the
mode
of
procedure
and
try
them
after
death
having
first
sent
down
prometheus
to
take
away
from
them
the
foreknowledge
of
death
minos
rhadamanthus
and
aeacus
were
appointed
to
be
the
judges
rhadamanthus
for
asia
aeacus
for
europe
and
minos
was
to
hold
the
court
of
appeal
now
death
is
the
separation
of
soul
and
body
but
after
death
soul
and
body
alike
retain
their
characteristics
the
fat
man
the
dandy
the
branded
slave
are
all
distinguishable
some
prince
or
potentate
perhaps
even
the
great
king
himself
appears
before
rhadamanthus
and
he
instantly
detects
him
though
he
knows
not
who
he
is
he
sees
the
scars
of
perjury
and
iniquity
and
sends
him
away
to
the
house
of
torment
for
there
are
two
classes
of
souls
who
undergo
punishment
the
curable
and
the
incurable
the
curable
are
those
who
are
benefited
by
their
punishment
the
incurable
are
such
as
archelaus
who
benefit
others
by
becoming
a
warning
to
them
the
latter
class
are
generally
kings
and
potentates
meaner
persons
happily
for
themselves
have
not
the
same
power
of
doing
injustice
sisyphus
and
tityus
not
thersites
are
supposed
by
homer
to
be
undergoing
everlasting
punishment
not
that
there
is
anything
to
prevent
a
great
man
from
being
a
good
one
as
is
shown
by
the
famous
example
of
aristeides
the
son
of
lysimachus
but
to
rhadamanthus
the
souls
are
only
known
as
good
or
bad
they
are
stripped
of
their
dignities
and
preferments
he
despatches
the
bad
to
tartarus
labelled
either
as
curable
or
incurable
and
looks
with
love
and
admiration
on
the
soul
of
some
just
one
whom
he
sends
to
the
islands
of
the
blest
similar
is
the
practice
of
aeacus
and
minos
overlooks
them
holding
a
golden
sceptre
as
odysseus
in
homer
saw
him
a
sceptre
of
gold
and
giving
laws
to
the
dead
my
wish
for
myself
and
my
is
that
we
may
present
our
souls
undefiled
to
the
judge
in
that
day
my
desire
in
life
is
to
be
able
to
meet
death
and
i
exhort
you
and
retort
upon
you
the
reproach
which
you
cast
upon
me
that
you
will
stand
before
the
judge
gaping
and
with
dizzy
brain
and
any
one
may
box
you
on
the
ear
and
do
you
all
manner
of
evil
perhaps
you
think
that
this
is
an
old
wives
fable
but
you
who
are
the
three
wisest
men
in
hellas
have
nothing
better
to
say
and
no
one
will
ever
show
that
to
do
is
better
than
to
suffer
evil
a
man
should
study
to
be
and
not
merely
to
seem
if
he
is
bad
he
should
become
good
and
avoid
all
flattery
whether
of
the
many
or
of
the
few
follow
me
then
and
if
you
are
looked
down
upon
that
will
do
you
no
harm
and
when
we
have
practised
virtue
we
will
betake
ourselves
to
politics
but
not
until
we
are
delivered
from
the
shameful
state
of
ignorance
and
uncertainty
in
which
we
are
at
present
let
us
follow
in
the
way
of
virtue
and
justice
and
not
in
the
way
to
which
you
callicles
invite
us
for
that
way
is
nothing
worth
we
will
now
consider
in
order
some
of
the
principal
points
of
the
dialogue
having
regard
to
the
age
of
plato
and
the
ironical
character
of
his
writings
we
may
compare
him
with
himself
and
with
other
great
teachers
and
we
may
note
in
passing
the
objections
of
his
critics
and
then
casting
one
eye
upon
him
we
may
cast
another
upon
ourselves
and
endeavour
to
draw
out
the
great
lessons
which
he
teaches
for
all
time
stripped
of
the
accidental
form
in
which
they
are
enveloped
in
the
gorgias
as
in
nearly
all
the
other
dialogues
of
plato
we
are
made
aware
that
formal
logic
has
as
yet
no
existence
the
old
difficulty
of
framing
a
definition
recurs
the
illusive
analogy
of
the
arts
and
the
virtues
also
continues
the
ambiguity
of
several
words
such
as
nature
custom
the
honourable
the
good
is
not
cleared
up
the
sophists
are
still
floundering
about
the
distinction
of
the
real
and
seeming
figures
of
speech
are
made
the
basis
of
arguments
the
possibility
of
conceiving
a
universal
art
or
science
which
admits
of
application
to
a
particular
is
a
difficulty
which
remains
unsolved
and
has
not
altogether
ceased
to
haunt
the
world
at
the
present
day
compare
charmides
the
defect
of
clearness
is
also
apparent
in
socrates
himself
unless
we
suppose
him
to
be
practising
on
the
simplicity
of
his
opponent
or
rather
perhaps
trying
an
experiment
in
dialectics
nothing
can
be
more
fallacious
than
the
contradiction
which
he
pretends
to
have
discovered
in
the
answers
of
gorgias
see
above
the
advantages
which
he
gains
over
polus
are
also
due
to
a
false
antithesis
of
pleasure
and
good
and
to
an
erroneous
assertion
that
an
agent
and
a
patient
may
be
described
by
similar
predicates
a
mistake
which
aristotle
partly
shares
and
partly
corrects
in
the
nicomachean
ethics
traces
of
a
sophistry
are
likewise
discernible
in
his
argument
with
callicles
although
socrates
professes
to
be
convinced
by
reason
only
yet
the
argument
is
often
a
sort
of
dialectical
fiction
by
which
he
conducts
himself
and
others
to
his
own
ideal
of
life
and
action
and
we
may
sometimes
wish
that
we
could
have
suggested
answers
to
his
antagonists
or
pointed
out
to
them
the
rocks
which
lay
concealed
under
the
ambiguous
terms
good
pleasure
and
the
like
but
it
would
be
as
useless
to
examine
his
arguments
by
the
requirements
of
modern
logic
as
to
criticise
this
ideal
from
a
merely
utilitarian
point
of
view
if
we
say
that
the
ideal
is
generally
regarded
as
unattainable
and
that
mankind
will
by
no
means
agree
in
thinking
that
the
criminal
is
happier
when
punished
than
when
unpunished
any
more
than
they
would
agree
to
the
stoical
paradox
that
a
man
may
be
happy
on
the
rack
plato
has
already
admitted
that
the
world
is
against
him
neither
does
he
mean
to
say
that
archelaus
is
tormented
by
the
stings
of
conscience
or
that
the
sensations
of
the
impaled
criminal
are
more
agreeable
than
those
of
the
tyrant
drowned
in
luxurious
enjoyment
neither
is
he
speaking
as
in
the
protagoras
of
virtue
as
a
calculation
of
pleasure
an
opinion
which
he
afterwards
repudiates
in
the
phaedo
what
then
is
his
meaning
his
meaning
we
shall
be
able
to
illustrate
best
by
parallel
notions
which
whether
justifiable
by
logic
or
not
have
always
existed
among
mankind
we
must
remind
the
reader
that
socrates
himself
implies
that
he
will
be
understood
or
appreciated
by
very
few
he
is
speaking
not
of
the
consciousness
of
happiness
but
of
the
idea
of
happiness
when
a
martyr
dies
in
a
good
cause
when
a
soldier
falls
in
battle
we
do
not
suppose
that
death
or
wounds
are
without
pain
or
that
their
physical
suffering
is
always
compensated
by
a
mental
satisfaction
still
we
regard
them
as
happy
and
we
would
a
thousand
times
rather
have
their
death
than
a
shameful
life
nor
is
this
only
because
we
believe
that
they
will
obtain
an
immortality
of
fame
or
that
they
will
have
crowns
of
glory
in
another
world
when
their
enemies
and
persecutors
will
be
proportionably
tormented
men
are
found
in
a
few
instances
to
do
what
is
right
without
reference
to
public
opinion
or
to
consequences
and
we
regard
them
as
happy
on
this
ground
only
much
as
friends
in
the
opening
of
the
phaedo
are
described
as
regarding
him
or
as
was
said
of
another
looked
upon
his
face
as
upon
the
face
of
an
angel
we
are
not
concerned
to
justify
this
idealism
by
the
standard
of
utility
or
public
opinion
but
merely
to
point
out
the
existence
of
such
a
sentiment
in
the
better
part
of
human
nature
the
idealism
of
plato
is
founded
upon
this
sentiment
he
would
maintain
that
in
some
sense
or
other
truth
and
right
are
alone
to
be
sought
and
that
all
other
goods
are
only
desirable
as
means
towards
these
he
is
thought
to
have
erred
in
the
agent
only
and
making
no
reference
to
the
happiness
of
others
as
affected
by
him
but
the
happiness
of
others
or
of
mankind
if
regarded
as
an
end
is
really
quite
as
ideal
and
almost
as
paradoxical
to
the
common
understanding
as
plato
conception
of
happiness
for
the
greatest
happiness
of
the
greatest
number
may
mean
also
the
greatest
pain
of
the
individual
which
will
procure
the
greatest
pleasure
of
the
greatest
number
ideas
of
utility
like
those
of
duty
and
right
may
be
pushed
to
unpleasant
consequences
nor
can
plato
in
the
gorgias
be
deemed
purely
considering
that
socrates
expressly
mentions
the
duty
of
imparting
the
truth
when
discovered
to
others
nor
must
we
forget
that
the
side
of
ethics
which
regards
others
is
by
the
ancients
merged
in
politics
both
in
plato
and
aristotle
as
well
as
in
the
stoics
the
social
principle
though
taking
another
form
is
really
far
more
prominent
than
in
most
modern
treatises
on
ethics
the
idealizing
of
suffering
is
one
of
the
conceptions
which
have
exercised
the
greatest
influence
on
mankind
into
the
theological
import
of
this
or
into
the
consideration
of
the
errors
to
which
the
idea
may
have
given
rise
we
need
not
now
enter
all
will
agree
that
the
ideal
of
the
divine
sufferer
whose
words
the
world
would
not
receive
the
man
of
sorrows
of
whom
the
hebrew
prophets
spoke
has
sunk
deep
into
the
heart
of
the
human
race
it
is
a
similar
picture
of
suffering
goodness
which
plato
desires
to
pourtray
not
without
an
allusion
to
the
fate
of
his
master
socrates
he
is
convinced
that
somehow
or
other
such
an
one
must
be
happy
in
life
or
after
death
in
the
republic
he
endeavours
to
show
that
his
happiness
would
be
assured
here
in
a
state
but
in
the
actual
condition
of
human
things
the
wise
and
good
are
weak
and
miserable
such
an
one
is
like
a
man
fallen
among
wild
beasts
exposed
to
every
sort
of
wrong
and
obloquy
plato
like
other
philosophers
is
thus
led
on
to
the
conclusion
that
if
ways
of
god
to
man
are
to
be
the
hopes
of
another
life
must
be
included
if
the
question
could
have
been
put
to
him
whether
a
man
dying
in
torments
was
happy
still
even
if
as
he
suggests
in
the
apology
be
only
a
long
sleep
we
can
hardly
tell
what
would
have
been
his
answer
there
have
been
a
few
who
quite
independently
of
rewards
and
punishments
or
of
posthumous
reputation
or
any
other
influence
of
public
opinion
have
been
willing
to
sacrifice
their
lives
for
the
good
of
others
it
is
difficult
to
say
how
far
in
such
cases
an
unconscious
hope
of
a
future
life
or
a
general
faith
in
the
victory
of
good
in
the
world
may
have
supported
the
sufferers
but
this
extreme
idealism
is
not
in
accordance
with
the
spirit
of
plato
he
supposes
a
day
of
retribution
in
which
the
good
are
to
be
rewarded
and
the
wicked
punished
though
as
he
says
in
the
phaedo
no
man
of
sense
will
maintain
that
the
details
of
the
stories
about
another
world
are
true
he
will
insist
that
something
of
the
kind
is
true
and
will
frame
his
life
with
a
view
to
this
unknown
future
even
in
the
republic
he
introduces
a
future
life
as
an
afterthought
when
the
superior
happiness
of
the
just
has
been
established
on
what
is
thought
to
be
an
immutable
foundation
at
the
same
time
he
makes
a
point
of
determining
his
main
thesis
independently
of
remoter
consequences
plato
theory
of
punishment
is
partly
vindictive
partly
corrective
in
the
gorgias
as
well
as
in
the
phaedo
and
republic
a
few
great
criminals
chiefly
tyrants
are
reserved
as
examples
but
most
men
have
never
had
the
opportunity
of
attaining
this
of
evil
they
are
not
incurable
and
their
punishment
is
intended
for
their
improvement
they
are
to
suffer
because
they
have
sinned
like
sick
men
they
must
go
to
the
physician
and
be
healed
on
this
representation
of
plato
the
criticism
has
been
made
that
the
analogy
of
disease
and
injustice
is
partial
only
and
that
suffering
instead
of
improving
men
may
have
just
the
opposite
effect
like
the
general
analogy
of
the
arts
and
the
virtues
the
analogy
of
disease
and
injustice
or
of
medicine
and
justice
is
certainly
imperfect
but
ideas
must
be
given
through
something
the
nature
of
the
mind
which
is
unseen
can
only
be
represented
under
figures
derived
from
visible
objects
if
these
figures
are
suggestive
of
some
new
aspect
under
which
the
mind
may
be
considered
we
can
not
find
fault
with
them
for
not
exactly
coinciding
with
the
ideas
represented
they
partake
of
the
imperfect
nature
of
language
and
must
not
be
construed
in
too
strict
a
manner
that
plato
sometimes
reasons
from
them
as
if
they
were
not
figures
but
realities
is
due
to
the
defective
logical
analysis
of
his
age
nor
does
he
distinguish
between
the
suffering
which
improves
and
the
suffering
which
only
punishes
and
deters
he
applies
to
the
sphere
of
ethics
a
conception
of
punishment
which
is
really
derived
from
criminal
law
he
does
not
see
that
such
punishment
is
only
negative
and
supplies
no
principle
of
moral
growth
or
development
he
is
not
far
off
the
higher
notion
of
an
education
of
man
to
be
begun
in
this
world
and
to
be
continued
in
other
stages
of
existence
which
is
further
developed
in
the
republic
and
christian
thinkers
who
have
ventured
out
of
the
beaten
track
in
their
meditations
on
the
things
have
found
a
ray
of
light
in
his
writings
but
he
has
not
explained
how
or
in
what
way
punishment
is
to
contribute
to
the
improvement
of
mankind
he
has
not
followed
out
the
principle
which
he
affirms
in
the
republic
that
is
the
author
of
evil
only
with
a
view
to
good
and
that
were
the
better
for
being
punished
still
his
doctrine
of
a
future
state
of
rewards
and
punishments
may
be
compared
favourably
with
that
perversion
of
christian
doctrine
which
makes
the
everlasting
punishment
of
human
beings
depend
on
a
brief
moment
of
time
or
even
on
the
accident
of
an
accident
and
he
has
escaped
the
difficulty
which
has
often
beset
divines
respecting
the
future
destiny
of
the
meaner
sort
of
men
thersites
and
the
like
who
are
neither
very
good
nor
very
bad
by
not
counting
them
worthy
of
eternal
damnation
we
do
plato
violence
in
pressing
his
figures
of
speech
or
chains
of
argument
and
not
less
so
in
asking
questions
which
were
beyond
the
horizon
of
his
vision
or
did
not
come
within
the
scope
of
his
design
the
main
purpose
of
the
gorgias
is
not
to
answer
questions
about
a
future
world
but
to
place
in
antagonism
the
true
and
false
life
and
to
contrast
the
judgments
and
opinions
of
men
with
judgment
according
to
the
truth
plato
may
be
accused
of
representing
a
superhuman
or
transcendental
virtue
in
the
description
of
the
just
man
in
the
gorgias
or
in
the
companion
portrait
of
the
philosopher
in
the
theaetetus
and
at
the
same
time
may
be
thought
to
be
condemning
a
state
of
the
world
which
always
has
existed
and
always
will
exist
among
men
but
such
ideals
act
powerfully
on
the
imagination
of
mankind
and
such
condemnations
are
not
mere
paradoxes
of
philosophers
but
the
natural
rebellion
of
the
higher
sense
of
right
in
man
against
the
ordinary
conditions
of
human
life
the
greatest
statesmen
have
fallen
very
far
short
of
the
political
ideal
and
are
therefore
justly
involved
in
the
general
condemnation
subordinate
to
the
main
purpose
of
the
dialogue
are
some
other
questions
which
may
be
briefly
considered
a
the
antithesis
of
good
and
pleasure
which
as
in
other
dialogues
is
supposed
to
consist
in
the
permanent
nature
of
the
one
compared
with
the
transient
and
relative
nature
of
the
other
good
and
pleasure
knowledge
and
sense
truth
and
opinion
essence
and
generation
virtue
and
pleasure
the
real
and
the
apparent
the
infinite
and
finite
harmony
or
beauty
and
discord
dialectic
and
rhetoric
or
poetry
are
so
many
pairs
of
opposites
which
in
plato
easily
pass
into
one
another
and
are
seldom
kept
perfectly
distinct
and
we
must
not
forget
that
conception
of
pleasure
is
the
heracleitean
flux
transferred
to
the
sphere
of
human
conduct
there
is
some
degree
of
unfairness
in
opposing
the
principle
of
good
which
is
objective
to
the
principle
of
pleasure
which
is
subjective
for
the
assertion
of
the
permanence
of
good
is
only
based
on
the
assumption
of
its
objective
character
had
plato
fixed
his
mind
not
on
the
ideal
nature
of
good
but
on
the
subjective
consciousness
of
happiness
that
would
have
been
found
to
be
as
transient
and
precarious
as
pleasure
b
the
arts
or
sciences
when
pursued
without
any
view
to
truth
or
the
improvement
of
human
life
are
called
flatteries
they
are
all
alike
dependent
upon
the
opinion
of
mankind
from
which
they
are
derived
to
plato
the
whole
world
appears
to
be
sunk
in
error
based
on
to
this
is
opposed
the
one
wise
man
hardly
professing
to
have
found
truth
yet
strong
in
the
conviction
that
a
virtuous
life
is
the
only
good
whether
regarded
with
reference
to
this
world
or
to
another
statesmen
sophists
rhetoricians
poets
are
alike
brought
up
for
judgment
they
are
the
parodies
of
wise
men
and
their
arts
are
the
parodies
of
true
arts
and
sciences
all
that
they
call
science
is
merely
the
result
of
that
study
of
the
tempers
of
the
great
beast
which
he
describes
in
the
republic
various
other
points
of
contact
naturally
suggest
themselves
between
the
gorgias
and
other
dialogues
especially
the
republic
the
philebus
and
the
protagoras
there
are
closer
resemblances
both
of
spirit
and
language
in
the
republic
than
in
any
other
dialogue
the
verbal
similarity
tending
to
show
that
they
were
written
at
the
same
period
of
plato
life
for
the
republic
supplies
that
education
and
training
of
which
the
gorgias
suggests
the
necessity
the
theory
of
the
many
weak
combining
against
the
few
strong
in
the
formation
of
society
which
is
indeed
a
partial
truth
is
similar
in
both
of
them
and
is
expressed
in
nearly
the
same
language
the
sufferings
and
fate
of
the
just
man
the
powerlessness
of
evil
and
the
reversal
of
the
situation
in
another
life
are
also
points
of
similarity
the
poets
like
the
rhetoricians
are
condemned
because
they
aim
at
pleasure
only
as
in
the
republic
they
are
expelled
the
state
because
they
are
imitators
and
minister
to
the
weaker
side
of
human
nature
that
poetry
is
akin
to
rhetoric
may
be
compared
with
the
analogous
notion
which
occurs
in
the
protagoras
that
the
ancient
poets
were
the
sophists
of
their
day
in
some
other
respects
the
protagoras
rather
offers
a
contrast
than
a
parallel
the
character
of
protagoras
may
be
compared
with
that
of
gorgias
but
the
conception
of
happiness
is
different
in
the
two
dialogues
being
described
in
the
former
according
to
the
old
socratic
notion
as
deferred
or
accumulated
pleasure
while
in
the
gorgias
and
in
the
phaedo
pleasure
and
good
are
distinctly
opposed
this
opposition
is
carried
out
from
a
speculative
point
of
view
in
the
philebus
there
neither
pleasure
nor
wisdom
are
allowed
to
be
the
chief
good
but
pleasure
and
good
are
not
so
completely
opposed
as
in
the
gorgias
for
innocent
pleasures
and
such
as
have
no
antecedent
pains
are
allowed
to
rank
in
the
class
of
goods
the
allusion
to
definition
of
rhetoric
philebus
compare
gorg
as
the
art
of
persuasion
of
all
arts
the
best
for
to
it
all
things
submit
not
by
compulsion
but
of
their
own
free
will
marks
a
close
and
perhaps
designed
connection
between
the
two
dialogues
in
both
the
ideas
of
measure
order
harmony
are
the
connecting
links
between
the
beautiful
and
the
good
in
general
spirit
and
character
that
is
in
irony
and
antagonism
to
public
opinion
the
gorgias
most
nearly
resembles
the
apology
crito
and
portions
of
the
republic
and
like
the
philebus
though
from
another
point
of
view
may
be
thought
to
stand
in
the
same
relation
to
theory
of
morals
which
the
theaetetus
bears
to
his
theory
of
knowledge
a
few
minor
points
still
remain
to
be
summed
up
the
extravagant
irony
in
the
reason
which
is
assigned
for
the
pilot
modest
charge
and
in
the
proposed
use
of
rhetoric
as
an
instrument
of
and
in
the
mighty
power
of
geometrical
equality
in
both
worlds
the
reference
of
the
mythus
to
the
previous
discussion
should
not
be
overlooked
the
fate
reserved
for
incurable
criminals
such
as
archelaus
the
retaliation
of
the
box
on
the
ears
the
nakedness
of
the
souls
and
of
the
judges
who
are
stript
of
the
clothes
or
disguises
which
rhetoric
and
public
opinion
have
hitherto
provided
for
them
compare
notion
that
the
universe
is
a
suit
of
clothes
tale
of
a
tub
the
fiction
seems
to
have
involved
plato
in
the
necessity
of
supposing
that
the
soul
retained
a
sort
of
corporeal
likeness
after
death
the
appeal
of
the
authority
of
homer
who
says
that
odysseus
saw
minos
in
his
court
a
golden
sceptre
which
gives
verisimilitude
to
the
tale
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
repeat
that
plato
is
playing
sides
of
the
game
and
that
in
criticising
the
characters
of
gorgias
and
polus
we
are
not
passing
any
judgment
on
historical
individuals
but
only
attempting
to
analyze
the
personae
as
they
were
conceived
by
him
neither
is
it
necessary
to
enlarge
upon
the
obvious
fact
that
plato
is
a
dramatic
writer
whose
real
opinions
can
not
always
be
assumed
to
be
those
which
he
puts
into
the
mouth
of
socrates
or
any
other
speaker
who
appears
to
have
the
best
of
the
argument
or
to
repeat
the
observation
that
he
is
a
poet
as
well
as
a
philosopher
or
to
remark
that
he
is
not
to
be
tried
by
a
modern
standard
but
interpreted
with
reference
to
his
place
in
the
history
of
thought
and
the
opinion
of
his
time
it
has
been
said
that
the
most
characteristic
feature
of
the
gorgias
is
the
assertion
of
the
right
of
dissent
or
private
judgment
but
this
mode
of
stating
the
question
is
really
opposed
both
to
the
spirit
of
plato
and
of
ancient
philosophy
generally
for
plato
is
not
asserting
any
abstract
right
or
duty
of
toleration
or
advantage
to
be
derived
from
freedom
of
thought
indeed
in
some
other
parts
of
his
writings
laws
he
has
fairly
laid
himself
open
to
the
charge
of
intolerance
no
speculations
had
as
yet
arisen
respecting
the
of
prophesying
and
plato
is
not
affirming
any
abstract
right
of
this
nature
but
he
is
asserting
the
duty
and
right
of
the
one
wise
and
true
man
to
dissent
from
the
folly
and
falsehood
of
the
many
at
the
same
time
he
acknowledges
the
natural
result
which
he
hardly
seeks
to
avert
that
he
who
speaks
the
truth
to
a
multitude
regardless
of
consequences
will
probably
share
the
fate
of
socrates
the
irony
of
plato
sometimes
veils
from
us
the
height
of
idealism
to
which
he
soars
when
declaring
truths
which
the
many
will
not
receive
he
puts
on
an
armour
which
can
not
be
pierced
by
them
the
weapons
of
ridicule
are
taken
out
of
their
hands
and
the
laugh
is
turned
against
themselves
the
disguises
which
socrates
assumes
are
like
the
parables
of
the
new
testament
or
the
oracles
of
the
delphian
god
they
half
conceal
half
reveal
his
meaning
the
more
he
is
in
earnest
the
more
ironical
he
becomes
and
he
is
never
more
in
earnest
or
more
ironical
than
in
the
gorgias
he
hardly
troubles
himself
to
answer
seriously
the
objections
of
gorgias
and
polus
and
therefore
he
sometimes
appears
to
be
careless
of
the
ordinary
requirements
of
logic
yet
in
the
highest
sense
he
is
always
logical
and
consistent
with
himself
the
form
of
the
argument
may
be
paradoxical
the
substance
is
an
appeal
to
the
higher
reason
he
is
uttering
truths
before
they
can
be
understood
as
in
all
ages
the
words
of
philosophers
when
they
are
first
uttered
have
found
the
world
unprepared
for
them
a
further
misunderstanding
arises
out
of
the
wildness
of
his
humour
he
is
supposed
not
only
by
callicles
but
by
the
rest
of
mankind
to
be
jesting
when
he
is
profoundly
serious
at
length
he
makes
even
polus
in
earnest
finally
he
drops
the
argument
and
heedless
any
longer
of
the
forms
of
dialectic
he
loses
himself
in
a
sort
of
triumph
while
at
the
same
time
he
retaliates
upon
his
adversaries
from
this
confusion
of
jest
and
earnest
we
may
now
return
to
the
ideal
truth
and
draw
out
in
a
simple
form
the
main
theses
of
the
dialogue
first
thesis
it
is
a
greater
evil
to
do
than
to
suffer
injustice
compare
the
new
testament
is
better
to
suffer
for
well
doing
than
for
evil
doing
pet
and
the
sermon
on
the
mount
are
they
that
are
persecuted
for
righteousness
matt
the
words
of
socrates
are
more
abstract
than
the
words
of
christ
but
they
equally
imply
that
the
only
real
evil
is
moral
evil
the
righteous
may
suffer
or
die
but
they
have
their
reward
and
even
if
they
had
no
reward
would
be
happier
than
the
wicked
the
world
represented
by
polus
is
ready
when
they
are
asked
to
acknowledge
that
injustice
is
dishonourable
and
for
their
own
sakes
men
are
willing
to
punish
the
offender
compare
republic
but
they
are
not
equally
willing
to
acknowledge
that
injustice
even
if
successful
is
essentially
evil
and
has
the
nature
of
disease
and
death
especially
when
crimes
are
committed
on
the
great
scale
the
crimes
of
tyrants
ancient
or
modern
after
a
while
seeing
that
they
can
not
be
undone
and
have
become
a
part
of
history
mankind
are
disposed
to
forgive
them
not
from
any
magnanimity
or
charity
but
because
their
feelings
are
blunted
by
time
and
forgive
is
convenient
to
them
the
tangle
of
good
and
evil
can
no
longer
be
unravelled
and
although
they
know
that
the
end
can
not
justify
the
means
they
feel
also
that
good
has
often
come
out
of
evil
but
socrates
would
have
us
pass
the
same
judgment
on
the
tyrant
now
and
always
though
he
is
surrounded
by
his
satellites
and
has
the
applauses
of
europe
and
asia
ringing
in
his
ears
though
he
is
the
civilizer
or
liberator
of
half
a
continent
he
is
and
always
will
be
the
most
miserable
of
men
the
greatest
consequences
for
good
or
for
evil
can
not
alter
a
hair
breadth
the
morality
of
actions
which
are
right
or
wrong
in
themselves
this
is
the
standard
which
socrates
holds
up
to
us
because
politics
and
perhaps
human
life
generally
are
of
a
mixed
nature
we
must
not
allow
our
principles
to
sink
to
the
level
of
our
practice
and
so
of
private
individuals
to
them
too
the
world
occasionally
speaks
of
the
consequences
of
their
actions
if
they
are
lovers
of
pleasure
they
will
ruin
their
health
if
they
are
false
or
dishonest
they
will
lose
their
character
but
socrates
would
speak
to
them
not
of
what
will
be
but
of
what
is
of
the
present
consequence
of
lowering
and
degrading
the
soul
and
all
higher
natures
or
perhaps
all
men
everywhere
if
they
were
not
tempted
by
interest
or
passion
would
agree
with
him
they
would
rather
be
the
victims
than
the
perpetrators
of
an
act
of
treachery
or
of
tyranny
reason
tells
them
that
death
comes
sooner
or
later
to
all
and
is
not
so
great
an
evil
as
an
unworthy
life
or
rather
if
rightly
regarded
not
an
evil
at
all
but
to
a
good
man
the
greatest
good
for
in
all
of
us
there
are
slumbering
ideals
of
truth
and
right
which
may
at
any
time
awaken
and
develop
a
new
life
in
us
second
thesis
it
is
better
to
suffer
for
wrong
doing
than
not
to
suffer
there
might
have
been
a
condition
of
human
life
in
which
the
penalty
followed
at
once
and
was
proportioned
to
the
offence
moral
evil
would
then
be
scarcely
distinguishable
from
physical
mankind
would
avoid
vice
as
they
avoid
pain
or
death
but
nature
with
a
view
of
deepening
and
enlarging
our
characters
has
for
the
most
part
hidden
from
us
the
consequences
of
our
actions
and
we
can
only
foresee
them
by
an
effort
of
reflection
to
awaken
in
us
this
habit
of
reflection
is
the
business
of
early
education
which
is
continued
in
maturer
years
by
observation
and
experience
the
spoilt
child
is
in
later
life
said
to
be
unfortunate
he
had
better
have
suffered
when
he
was
young
and
been
saved
from
suffering
afterwards
but
is
not
the
sovereign
equally
unfortunate
whose
education
and
manner
of
life
are
always
concealing
from
him
the
consequences
of
his
own
actions
until
at
length
they
are
revealed
to
him
in
some
terrible
downfall
which
may
perhaps
have
been
caused
not
by
his
own
fault
another
illustration
is
afforded
by
the
pauper
and
criminal
classes
who
scarcely
reflect
at
all
except
on
the
means
by
which
they
can
compass
their
immediate
ends
we
pity
them
and
make
allowances
for
them
but
we
do
not
consider
that
the
same
principle
applies
to
human
actions
generally
not
to
have
been
found
out
in
some
dishonesty
or
folly
regarded
from
a
moral
or
religious
point
of
view
is
the
greatest
of
misfortunes
the
success
of
our
evil
doings
is
a
proof
that
the
gods
have
ceased
to
strive
with
us
and
have
given
us
over
to
ourselves
there
is
nothing
to
remind
us
of
our
sins
and
therefore
nothing
to
correct
them
like
our
sorrows
they
are
healed
by
time
rank
corruption
mining
all
within
infects
unseen
the
irony
of
socrates
adds
a
corollary
to
the
argument
you
punish
your
enemy
you
should
allow
him
to
escape
unpunished
this
is
the
true
retaliation
compare
the
obscure
verse
of
proverbs
if
thine
enemy
hunger
feed
him
quoted
in
romans
men
are
not
in
the
habit
of
dwelling
upon
the
dark
side
of
their
own
lives
they
do
not
easily
see
themselves
as
others
see
them
they
are
very
kind
and
very
blind
to
their
own
faults
the
rhetoric
of
is
always
pleading
with
them
on
their
own
behalf
adopting
a
similar
figure
of
speech
socrates
would
have
them
use
rhetoric
not
in
defence
but
in
accusation
of
themselves
as
they
are
guided
by
feeling
rather
than
by
reason
to
their
feelings
the
appeal
must
be
made
they
must
speak
to
themselves
they
must
argue
with
themselves
they
must
paint
in
eloquent
words
the
character
of
their
own
evil
deeds
to
any
suffering
which
they
have
deserved
they
must
persuade
themselves
to
submit
under
the
figure
there
lurks
a
real
thought
which
expressed
in
another
form
admits
of
an
easy
application
to
ourselves
for
do
not
we
too
accuse
as
well
as
excuse
ourselves
and
we
call
to
our
aid
the
rhetoric
of
prayer
and
preaching
which
the
mind
silently
employs
while
the
struggle
between
the
better
and
the
worse
is
going
on
within
us
and
sometimes
we
are
too
hard
upon
ourselves
because
we
want
to
restore
the
balance
which
has
overthrown
or
disturbed
and
then
again
we
may
hear
a
voice
as
of
a
parent
consoling
us
in
religious
diaries
a
sort
of
drama
is
often
enacted
by
the
consciences
of
men
or
else
excusing
them
for
all
our
life
long
we
are
talking
with
ourselves
what
is
thought
but
speech
what
is
feeling
but
rhetoric
and
if
rhetoric
is
used
on
one
side
only
we
shall
be
always
in
danger
of
being
deceived
and
so
the
words
of
socrates
which
at
first
sounded
paradoxical
come
home
to
the
experience
of
all
of
us
third
thesis
we
do
not
what
we
will
but
what
we
wish
socrates
would
teach
us
a
lesson
which
we
are
slow
to
learn
that
good
intentions
and
even
benevolent
actions
when
they
are
not
prompted
by
wisdom
are
of
no
value
we
believe
something
to
be
for
our
good
which
we
afterwards
find
out
not
to
be
for
our
good
the
consequences
may
be
inevitable
for
they
may
follow
an
invariable
law
yet
they
may
often
be
the
very
opposite
of
what
is
expected
by
us
when
we
increase
pauperism
by
almsgiving
when
we
tie
up
property
without
regard
to
changes
of
circumstances
when
we
say
hastily
what
we
deliberately
disapprove
when
we
do
in
a
moment
of
passion
what
upon
reflection
we
regret
when
from
any
want
of
we
give
another
an
advantage
over
us
we
are
doing
not
what
we
will
but
what
we
wish
all
actions
of
which
the
consequences
are
not
weighed
and
foreseen
are
of
this
impotent
and
paralytic
sort
and
the
author
of
them
has
least
possible
while
seeming
to
have
the
greatest
for
he
is
actually
bringing
about
the
reverse
of
what
he
intended
and
yet
the
book
of
nature
is
open
to
him
in
which
he
who
runs
may
read
if
he
will
exercise
ordinary
attention
every
day
offers
him
experiences
of
his
own
and
of
other
men
characters
and
he
passes
them
unheeded
by
the
contemplation
of
the
consequences
of
actions
and
the
ignorance
of
men
in
regard
to
them
seems
to
have
led
socrates
to
his
famous
thesis
is
knowledge
which
is
not
so
much
an
error
or
paradox
as
a
half
truth
seen
first
in
the
twilight
of
ethical
philosophy
but
also
the
half
of
the
truth
which
is
especially
needed
in
the
present
age
for
as
the
world
has
grown
older
men
have
been
too
apt
to
imagine
a
right
and
wrong
apart
from
consequences
while
a
few
on
the
other
hand
have
sought
to
resolve
them
wholly
into
their
consequences
but
socrates
or
plato
for
him
neither
divides
nor
identifies
them
though
the
time
has
not
yet
arrived
either
for
utilitarian
or
transcendental
systems
of
moral
philosophy
he
recognizes
the
two
elements
which
seem
to
lie
at
the
basis
of
morality
compare
the
following
and
for
us
it
is
a
time
to
hellenize
and
to
praise
knowing
for
we
have
hebraized
too
much
and
have
overvalued
doing
but
the
habits
and
discipline
received
from
hebraism
remain
for
our
race
an
eternal
possession
and
as
humanity
is
constituted
one
must
never
assign
the
second
rank
without
being
ready
to
restore
them
to
the
first
sir
william
hunter
preface
to
orissa
fourth
thesis
to
be
and
not
to
seem
is
the
end
of
life
the
greek
in
the
age
of
plato
admitted
praise
to
be
one
of
the
chief
incentives
to
moral
virtue
and
to
most
men
the
opinion
of
their
fellows
is
a
leading
principle
of
action
hence
a
certain
element
of
seeming
enters
into
all
things
all
or
almost
all
desire
to
appear
better
than
they
are
that
they
may
win
the
esteem
or
admiration
of
others
a
man
of
ability
can
easily
feign
the
language
of
piety
or
virtue
and
there
is
an
unconscious
as
well
as
a
conscious
hypocrisy
which
according
to
socrates
is
the
worst
of
the
two
again
there
is
the
sophistry
of
classes
and
professions
there
are
the
different
opinions
about
themselves
and
one
another
which
prevail
in
different
ranks
of
society
there
is
the
bias
given
to
the
mind
by
the
study
of
one
department
of
human
knowledge
to
the
exclusion
of
the
rest
and
stronger
far
the
prejudice
engendered
by
a
pecuniary
or
party
interest
in
certain
tenets
there
is
the
sophistry
of
law
the
sophistry
of
medicine
the
sophistry
of
politics
the
sophistry
of
theology
all
of
these
disguises
wear
the
appearance
of
the
truth
some
of
them
are
very
ancient
and
we
do
not
easily
disengage
ourselves
from
them
for
we
have
inherited
them
and
they
have
become
a
part
of
us
the
sophistry
of
an
ancient
greek
sophist
is
nothing
compared
with
the
sophistry
of
a
religious
order
or
of
a
church
in
which
during
many
ages
falsehood
has
been
accumulating
and
everything
has
been
said
on
one
side
and
nothing
on
the
other
the
conventions
and
customs
which
we
observe
in
conversation
and
the
opposition
of
our
interests
when
we
have
dealings
with
one
another
buyer
saith
it
is
nought
it
is
nought
etc
are
always
obscuring
our
sense
of
truth
and
right
the
sophistry
of
human
nature
is
far
more
subtle
than
the
deceit
of
any
one
man
few
persons
speak
freely
from
their
own
natures
and
scarcely
any
one
dares
to
think
for
himself
most
of
us
imperceptibly
fall
into
the
opinions
of
those
around
us
which
we
partly
help
to
make
a
man
who
would
shake
himself
loose
from
them
requires
great
force
of
mind
he
hardly
knows
where
to
begin
in
the
search
after
truth
on
every
side
he
is
met
by
the
world
which
is
not
an
abstraction
of
theologians
but
the
most
real
of
all
things
being
another
name
for
ourselves
when
regarded
collectively
and
subjected
to
the
influences
of
society
then
comes
socrates
impressed
as
no
other
man
ever
was
with
the
unreality
and
untruthfulness
of
popular
opinion
and
tells
mankind
that
they
must
be
and
not
seem
how
are
they
to
be
at
any
rate
they
must
have
the
spirit
and
desire
to
be
if
they
are
ignorant
they
must
acknowledge
their
ignorance
to
themselves
if
they
are
conscious
of
doing
evil
they
must
learn
to
do
well
if
they
are
weak
and
have
nothing
in
them
which
they
can
call
themselves
they
must
acquire
firmness
and
consistency
if
they
are
indifferent
they
must
begin
to
take
an
interest
in
the
great
questions
which
surround
them
they
must
try
to
be
what
they
would
fain
appear
in
the
eyes
of
their
a
single
individual
can
not
easily
change
public
opinion
but
he
can
be
true
and
innocent
simple
and
independent
he
can
know
what
he
does
and
what
he
does
not
know
and
though
not
without
an
effort
he
can
form
a
judgment
of
his
own
at
least
in
common
matters
in
his
most
secret
actions
he
can
show
the
same
high
principle
compare
republic
which
he
shows
when
supported
and
watched
by
public
opinion
and
on
some
fitting
occasion
on
some
question
of
humanity
or
truth
or
right
even
an
ordinary
man
from
the
natural
rectitude
of
his
disposition
may
be
found
to
take
up
arms
against
a
whole
tribe
of
politicians
and
lawyers
and
be
too
much
for
them
who
is
the
true
and
who
the
false
statesman
the
true
statesman
is
he
who
brings
order
out
of
disorder
who
first
organizes
and
then
administers
the
government
of
his
own
country
and
having
made
a
nation
seeks
to
reconcile
the
national
interests
with
those
of
europe
and
of
mankind
he
is
not
a
mere
theorist
nor
yet
a
dealer
in
expedients
the
whole
and
the
parts
grow
together
in
his
mind
while
the
head
is
conceiving
the
hand
is
executing
although
obliged
to
descend
to
the
world
he
is
not
of
the
world
his
thoughts
are
fixed
not
on
power
or
riches
or
extension
of
territory
but
on
an
ideal
state
in
which
all
the
citizens
have
an
equal
chance
of
health
and
life
and
the
highest
education
is
within
the
reach
of
all
and
the
moral
and
intellectual
qualities
of
every
individual
are
freely
developed
and
idea
of
good
is
the
animating
principle
of
the
whole
not
the
attainment
of
freedom
alone
or
of
order
alone
but
how
to
unite
freedom
with
order
is
the
problem
which
he
has
to
solve
the
statesman
who
places
before
himself
these
lofty
aims
has
undertaken
a
task
which
will
call
forth
all
his
powers
he
must
control
himself
before
he
can
control
others
he
must
know
mankind
before
he
can
manage
them
he
has
no
private
likes
or
dislikes
he
does
not
conceal
personal
enmity
under
the
disguise
of
moral
or
political
principle
such
meannesses
into
which
men
too
often
fall
unintentionally
are
absorbed
in
the
consciousness
of
his
mission
and
in
his
love
for
his
country
and
for
mankind
he
will
sometimes
ask
himself
what
the
next
generation
will
say
of
him
not
because
he
is
careful
of
posthumous
fame
but
because
he
knows
that
the
result
of
his
life
as
a
whole
will
then
be
more
fairly
judged
he
will
take
time
for
the
execution
of
his
plans
not
hurrying
them
on
when
the
mind
of
a
nation
is
unprepared
for
them
but
like
the
ruler
of
the
universe
himself
working
in
the
appointed
time
for
he
knows
that
human
life
not
long
in
comparison
with
republic
is
sufficient
for
the
fulfilment
of
many
great
purposes
he
knows
too
that
the
work
will
be
still
going
on
when
he
is
no
longer
here
and
he
will
sometimes
especially
when
his
powers
are
failing
think
of
that
other
of
which
the
pattern
is
in
heaven
republic
the
false
politician
is
the
of
the
state
in
order
to
govern
men
he
becomes
like
them
their
are
married
in
conjunction
they
themselves
like
vulgar
and
tyrannical
masters
and
he
is
their
obedient
servant
the
true
politician
if
he
would
rule
men
must
make
them
like
himself
he
must
his
party
until
they
cease
to
be
a
party
he
must
breathe
into
them
the
spirit
which
will
hereafter
give
form
to
their
institutions
politics
with
him
are
not
a
mechanism
for
seeming
what
he
is
not
or
for
carrying
out
the
will
of
the
majority
himself
a
representative
man
he
is
the
representative
not
of
the
lower
but
of
the
higher
elements
of
the
nation
there
is
a
better
as
well
as
a
worse
public
opinion
of
which
he
seeks
to
lay
hold
as
there
is
also
a
deeper
current
of
human
affairs
in
which
he
is
borne
up
when
the
waves
nearer
the
shore
are
threatening
him
he
acknowledges
that
he
can
not
take
the
world
by
force
two
or
three
moves
on
the
political
chess
board
are
all
that
he
can
fore
see
two
or
three
weeks
moves
on
the
political
chessboard
are
all
that
he
can
foresee
two
or
three
weeks
or
months
are
granted
to
him
in
which
he
can
provide
against
a
coming
struggle
but
he
knows
also
that
there
are
permanent
principles
of
politics
which
are
always
tending
to
the
of
states
better
administration
better
education
the
reconciliation
of
conflicting
elements
increased
security
against
external
enemies
these
are
not
or
yesterday
but
are
the
same
in
all
times
and
under
all
forms
of
government
then
when
the
storm
descends
and
the
winds
blow
though
he
knows
not
beforehand
the
hour
of
danger
the
pilot
not
like
captain
in
the
republic
and
deaf
but
with
penetrating
eye
and
quick
ear
is
ready
to
take
command
of
the
ship
and
guide
her
into
port
the
false
politician
asks
not
what
is
true
but
what
is
the
opinion
of
the
world
not
what
is
right
but
what
is
expedient
the
only
measures
of
which
he
approves
are
the
measures
which
will
pass
he
has
no
intention
of
fighting
an
uphill
battle
he
keeps
the
roadway
of
politics
he
is
unwilling
to
incur
the
persecution
and
enmity
which
political
convictions
would
entail
upon
him
he
begins
with
popularity
and
in
fair
weather
sails
gallantly
along
but
unpopularity
soon
follows
him
for
men
expect
their
leaders
to
be
better
and
wiser
than
themselves
to
be
their
guides
in
danger
their
saviours
in
extremity
they
do
not
really
desire
them
to
obey
all
the
ignorant
impulses
of
the
popular
mind
and
if
they
fail
them
in
a
crisis
they
are
disappointed
then
as
socrates
says
the
cry
of
ingratitude
is
heard
which
is
most
unreasonable
for
the
people
who
have
been
taught
no
better
have
done
what
might
be
expected
of
them
and
their
statesmen
have
received
justice
at
their
hands
the
true
statesman
is
aware
that
he
must
adapt
himself
to
times
and
circumstances
he
must
have
allies
if
he
is
to
fight
against
the
world
he
must
enlighten
public
opinion
he
must
accustom
his
followers
to
act
together
although
he
is
not
the
mere
executor
of
the
will
of
the
majority
he
must
win
over
the
majority
to
himself
he
is
their
leader
and
not
their
follower
but
in
order
to
lead
he
must
also
follow
he
will
neither
exaggerate
nor
undervalue
the
power
of
a
statesman
neither
adopting
the
faire
nor
the
government
principle
but
he
will
whether
he
is
dealing
with
children
in
politics
or
with
men
seek
to
do
for
the
people
what
the
government
can
do
for
them
and
what
from
imperfect
education
or
deficient
powers
of
combination
they
can
not
do
for
themselves
he
knows
that
if
he
does
too
much
for
them
they
will
do
nothing
and
that
if
he
does
nothing
for
them
they
will
in
some
states
of
society
be
utterly
helpless
for
the
many
can
not
exist
without
the
few
if
the
material
force
of
a
country
is
from
below
wisdom
and
experience
are
from
above
it
is
not
a
small
part
of
human
evils
which
kings
and
governments
make
or
cure
the
statesman
is
well
aware
that
a
great
purpose
carried
out
consistently
during
many
years
will
at
last
be
executed
he
is
playing
for
a
stake
which
may
be
partly
determined
by
some
accident
and
therefore
he
will
allow
largely
for
the
unknown
element
of
politics
but
the
game
being
one
in
which
chance
and
skill
are
combined
if
he
plays
long
enough
he
is
certain
of
victory
he
will
not
be
always
consistent
for
the
world
is
changing
and
though
he
depends
upon
the
support
of
a
party
he
will
remember
that
he
is
the
minister
of
the
whole
he
lives
not
for
the
present
but
for
the
future
and
he
is
not
at
all
sure
that
he
will
be
appreciated
either
now
or
then
for
he
may
have
the
existing
order
of
society
against
him
and
may
not
be
remembered
by
a
distant
posterity
there
are
always
discontented
idealists
in
politics
who
like
socrates
in
the
gorgias
find
fault
with
all
statesmen
past
as
well
as
present
not
excepting
the
greatest
names
of
history
mankind
have
an
uneasy
feeling
that
they
ought
to
be
better
governed
than
they
are
just
as
the
actual
philosopher
falls
short
of
the
one
wise
man
so
does
the
actual
statesman
fall
short
of
the
ideal
and
so
partly
from
vanity
and
egotism
but
partly
also
from
a
true
sense
of
the
faults
of
eminent
men
a
temper
of
dissatisfaction
and
criticism
springs
up
among
those
who
are
ready
enough
to
acknowledge
the
inferiority
of
their
own
powers
no
matter
whether
a
statesman
makes
high
professions
or
none
at
all
they
are
reduced
sooner
or
later
to
the
same
level
and
sometimes
the
more
unscrupulous
man
is
better
esteemed
than
the
more
conscientious
because
he
has
not
equally
deceived
expectations
such
sentiments
may
be
unjust
but
they
are
widely
spread
we
constantly
find
them
recurring
in
reviews
and
newspapers
and
still
oftener
in
private
conversation
we
may
further
observe
that
the
art
of
government
while
in
some
respects
tending
to
improve
has
in
others
a
tendency
to
degenerate
as
institutions
become
more
popular
governing
for
the
people
can
not
easily
be
combined
with
governing
by
the
people
the
interests
of
classes
are
too
strong
for
the
ideas
of
the
statesman
who
takes
a
comprehensive
view
of
the
whole
according
to
socrates
the
true
governor
will
find
ruin
or
death
staring
him
in
the
face
and
will
only
be
induced
to
govern
from
the
fear
of
being
governed
by
a
worse
man
than
himself
republic
and
in
modern
times
though
the
world
has
grown
milder
and
the
terrible
consequences
which
plato
foretells
no
longer
await
an
english
statesman
any
one
who
is
not
actuated
by
a
blind
ambition
will
only
undertake
from
a
sense
of
duty
a
work
in
which
he
is
most
likely
to
fail
and
even
if
he
succeed
will
rarely
be
rewarded
by
the
gratitude
of
his
own
generation
socrates
who
is
not
a
politician
at
all
tells
us
that
he
is
the
only
real
politician
of
his
time
let
us
illustrate
the
meaning
of
his
words
by
applying
them
to
the
history
of
our
own
country
he
would
have
said
that
not
pitt
or
fox
or
canning
or
sir
peel
are
the
real
politicians
of
their
time
but
locke
hume
adam
smith
bentham
ricardo
these
during
the
greater
part
of
their
lives
occupied
an
inconsiderable
space
in
the
eyes
of
the
public
they
were
private
persons
nevertheless
they
sowed
in
the
minds
of
men
seeds
which
in
the
next
generation
have
become
an
irresistible
power
is
that
saying
true
one
soweth
and
another
reapeth
we
may
imagine
with
plato
an
ideal
statesman
in
whom
practice
and
speculation
are
perfectly
harmonized
for
there
is
no
necessary
opposition
between
them
but
experience
shows
that
they
are
commonly
divorced
the
ordinary
politician
is
the
interpreter
or
executor
of
the
thoughts
of
others
and
hardly
ever
brings
to
the
birth
a
new
political
conception
one
or
two
only
in
modern
times
like
the
italian
statesman
cavour
have
created
the
world
in
which
they
moved
the
philosopher
is
naturally
unfitted
for
political
life
his
great
ideas
are
not
understood
by
the
many
he
is
a
thousand
miles
away
from
the
questions
of
the
day
yet
perhaps
the
lives
of
thinkers
as
they
are
stiller
and
deeper
are
also
happier
than
the
lives
of
those
who
are
more
in
the
public
eye
they
have
the
promise
of
the
future
though
they
are
regarded
as
dreamers
and
visionaries
by
their
own
contemporaries
and
when
they
are
no
longer
here
those
who
would
have
been
ashamed
of
them
during
their
lives
claim
kindred
with
them
and
are
proud
to
be
called
by
their
names
compare
thucyd
who
is
the
true
poet
plato
expels
the
poets
from
his
republic
because
they
are
allied
to
sense
because
they
stimulate
the
emotions
because
they
are
thrice
removed
from
the
ideal
truth
and
in
a
similar
spirit
he
declares
in
the
gorgias
that
the
stately
muse
of
tragedy
is
a
votary
of
pleasure
and
not
of
truth
in
modern
times
we
almost
ridicule
the
idea
of
poetry
admitting
of
a
moral
the
poet
and
the
prophet
or
preacher
in
primitive
antiquity
are
one
and
the
same
but
in
later
ages
they
seem
to
fall
apart
the
great
art
of
novel
writing
that
peculiar
creation
of
our
own
and
the
last
century
which
together
with
the
sister
art
of
review
writing
threatens
to
absorb
all
literature
has
even
less
of
seriousness
in
her
composition
do
we
not
often
hear
the
novel
writer
censured
for
attempting
to
convey
a
lesson
to
the
minds
of
his
readers
yet
the
true
office
of
a
poet
or
writer
of
fiction
is
not
merely
to
give
amusement
or
to
be
the
expression
of
the
feelings
of
mankind
good
or
bad
or
even
to
increase
our
knowledge
of
human
nature
there
have
been
poets
in
modern
times
such
as
goethe
or
wordsworth
who
have
not
forgotten
their
high
vocation
of
teachers
and
the
two
greatest
of
the
greek
dramatists
owe
their
sublimity
to
their
ethical
character
the
noblest
truths
sung
of
in
the
purest
and
sweetest
language
are
still
the
proper
material
of
poetry
the
poet
clothes
them
with
beauty
and
has
a
power
of
making
them
enter
into
the
hearts
and
memories
of
men
he
has
not
only
to
speak
of
themes
above
the
level
of
ordinary
life
but
to
speak
of
them
in
a
deeper
and
tenderer
way
than
they
are
ordinarily
felt
so
as
to
awaken
the
feeling
of
them
in
others
the
old
he
makes
young
again
the
familiar
principle
he
invests
with
a
new
dignity
he
finds
a
noble
expression
for
the
of
morality
and
politics
he
uses
the
things
of
sense
so
as
to
indicate
what
is
beyond
he
raises
us
through
earth
to
heaven
he
expresses
what
the
better
part
of
us
would
fain
say
and
the
feeling
is
strengthened
by
the
expression
he
is
his
own
critic
for
the
spirit
of
poetry
and
of
criticism
are
not
divided
in
him
his
mission
is
not
to
disguise
men
from
themselves
but
to
reveal
to
them
their
own
nature
and
make
them
better
acquainted
with
the
world
around
them
true
poetry
is
the
remembrance
of
youth
of
love
the
embodiment
in
words
of
the
happiest
and
holiest
moments
of
life
of
the
noblest
thoughts
of
man
of
the
greatest
deeds
of
the
past
the
poet
of
the
future
may
return
to
his
greater
calling
of
the
prophet
or
teacher
indeed
we
hardly
know
what
may
not
be
effected
for
the
human
race
by
a
better
use
of
the
poetical
and
imaginative
faculty
the
reconciliation
of
poetry
as
of
religion
with
truth
may
still
be
possible
neither
is
the
element
of
pleasure
to
be
excluded
for
when
we
substitute
a
higher
pleasure
for
a
lower
we
raise
men
in
the
scale
of
existence
might
not
the
novelist
too
make
an
ideal
or
rather
many
ideals
of
social
life
better
than
a
thousand
sermons
plato
like
the
puritans
is
too
much
afraid
of
poetic
and
artistic
influences
but
he
is
not
without
a
true
sense
of
the
noble
purposes
to
which
art
may
be
applied
republic
modern
poetry
is
often
a
sort
of
plaything
or
in
plato
language
a
flattery
a
sophistry
or
sham
in
which
without
any
serious
purpose
the
poet
lends
wings
to
his
fancy
and
exhibits
his
gifts
of
language
and
metre
such
an
one
seeks
to
gratify
the
taste
of
his
readers
he
has
the
faire
or
trick
of
writing
but
he
has
not
the
higher
spirit
of
poetry
he
has
no
conception
that
true
art
should
bring
order
out
of
disorder
that
it
should
make
provision
for
the
soul
highest
interest
that
it
should
be
pursued
only
with
a
view
to
improvement
of
the
citizens
he
ministers
to
the
weaker
side
of
human
nature
republic
he
idealizes
the
sensual
he
sings
the
strain
of
love
in
the
latest
fashion
instead
of
raising
men
above
themselves
he
brings
them
back
to
the
of
the
many
masters
from
which
all
his
life
long
a
good
man
has
been
praying
to
be
delivered
and
often
forgetful
of
measure
and
order
he
will
express
not
that
which
is
truest
but
that
which
is
strongest
instead
of
a
great
and
subject
perfect
in
every
part
some
fancy
of
a
heated
brain
is
worked
out
with
the
strangest
incongruity
he
is
not
the
master
of
his
words
but
his
words
perhaps
borrowed
from
another
the
faded
reflection
of
some
french
or
german
or
italian
writer
have
the
better
of
him
though
we
are
not
going
to
banish
the
poets
how
can
we
suppose
that
such
utterances
have
any
healing
or
influence
on
the
minds
of
men
us
hear
the
conclusion
of
the
whole
matter
art
then
must
be
true
and
politics
must
be
true
and
the
life
of
man
must
be
true
and
not
a
seeming
or
sham
in
all
of
them
order
has
to
be
brought
out
of
disorder
truth
out
of
error
and
falsehood
this
is
what
we
mean
by
the
greatest
improvement
of
man
and
so
having
considered
in
what
way
can
best
spend
the
appointed
time
we
leave
the
result
with
god
plato
does
not
say
that
god
will
order
all
things
for
the
best
compare
phaedo
but
he
indirectly
implies
that
the
evils
of
this
life
will
be
corrected
in
another
and
as
we
are
very
far
from
the
best
imaginable
world
at
present
plato
here
as
in
the
phaedo
and
republic
supposes
a
purgatory
or
place
of
education
for
mankind
in
general
and
for
a
very
few
a
tartarus
or
hell
the
myth
which
terminates
the
dialogue
is
not
the
revelation
but
rather
like
all
similar
descriptions
whether
in
the
bible
or
plato
the
veil
of
another
life
for
no
visible
thing
can
reveal
the
invisible
of
this
plato
unlike
some
commentators
on
scripture
is
fully
aware
neither
will
he
dogmatize
about
the
manner
in
which
we
are
again
republic
only
he
is
prepared
to
maintain
the
ultimate
triumph
of
truth
and
right
and
declares
that
no
one
not
even
the
wisest
of
the
greeks
can
affirm
any
other
doctrine
without
being
ridiculous
there
is
a
further
paradox
of
ethics
in
which
pleasure
and
pain
are
held
to
be
indifferent
and
virtue
at
the
time
of
action
and
without
regard
to
consequences
is
happiness
from
this
elevation
or
exaggeration
of
feeling
plato
seems
to
shrink
he
leaves
it
to
the
stoics
in
a
later
generation
to
maintain
that
when
impaled
or
on
the
rack
the
philosopher
may
be
happy
compare
republic
it
is
observable
that
in
the
republic
he
raises
this
question
but
it
is
not
really
discussed
the
veil
of
the
ideal
state
the
shadow
of
another
life
are
allowed
to
descend
upon
it
and
it
passes
out
of
sight
the
martyr
or
sufferer
in
the
cause
of
right
or
truth
is
often
supposed
to
die
in
raptures
having
his
eye
fixed
on
a
city
which
is
in
heaven
but
if
there
were
no
future
might
he
not
still
be
happy
in
the
performance
of
an
action
which
was
attended
only
by
a
painful
death
he
himself
may
be
ready
to
thank
god
that
he
was
thought
worthy
to
do
him
the
least
service
without
looking
for
a
reward
the
joys
of
another
life
may
not
have
been
present
to
his
mind
at
all
do
we
suppose
that
the
mediaeval
saint
bernard
francis
catharine
of
sienna
or
the
catholic
priest
who
lately
devoted
himself
to
death
by
a
lingering
disease
that
he
might
solace
and
help
others
was
thinking
of
the
of
heaven
no
the
work
was
already
heaven
to
him
and
enough
much
less
will
the
dying
patriot
be
dreaming
of
the
praises
of
man
or
of
an
immortality
of
fame
the
sense
of
duty
of
right
and
trust
in
god
will
be
sufficient
and
as
far
as
the
mind
can
reach
in
that
hour
if
he
were
certain
that
there
were
no
life
to
come
he
would
not
have
wished
to
speak
or
act
otherwise
than
he
did
in
the
cause
of
truth
or
of
humanity
neither
on
the
other
hand
will
he
suppose
that
god
has
forsaken
him
or
that
the
future
is
to
be
a
mere
blank
to
him
the
greatest
act
of
faith
the
only
faith
which
can
not
pass
away
is
his
who
has
not
known
but
yet
has
believed
a
very
few
among
the
sons
of
men
have
made
themselves
independent
of
circumstances
past
present
or
to
come
he
who
has
attained
to
such
a
temper
of
mind
has
already
present
with
him
eternal
life
he
needs
no
arguments
to
convince
him
of
immortality
he
has
in
him
already
a
principle
stronger
than
death
he
who
serves
man
without
the
thought
of
reward
is
deemed
to
be
a
more
faithful
servant
than
he
who
works
for
hire
may
not
the
service
of
god
which
is
the
more
disinterested
be
in
like
manner
the
higher
and
although
only
a
very
few
in
the
course
of
the
history
christ
himself
being
one
of
them
have
attained
to
such
a
noble
conception
of
god
and
of
the
human
soul
yet
the
ideal
of
them
may
be
present
to
us
and
the
remembrance
of
them
be
an
example
to
us
and
their
lives
may
shed
a
light
on
many
dark
places
both
of
philosophy
and
theology
the
myths
of
plato
the
myths
of
plato
are
a
phenomenon
unique
in
literature
there
are
four
longer
ones
these
occur
in
the
phaedrus
phaedo
gorgias
and
republic
that
in
the
republic
is
the
most
elaborate
and
finished
of
them
three
of
these
greater
myths
namely
those
contained
in
the
phaedo
the
gorgias
and
the
republic
relate
to
the
destiny
of
human
souls
in
a
future
life
the
magnificent
myth
in
the
phaedrus
treats
of
the
immortality
or
rather
the
eternity
of
the
soul
in
which
is
included
a
former
as
well
as
a
future
state
of
existence
to
these
may
be
added
the
myth
or
rather
fable
occurring
in
the
statesman
in
which
the
life
of
innocence
is
contrasted
with
the
ordinary
life
of
man
and
the
consciousness
of
evil
the
legend
of
the
island
of
atlantis
an
imaginary
history
which
is
a
fragment
only
commenced
in
the
timaeus
and
continued
in
the
critias
the
much
less
artistic
fiction
of
the
foundation
of
the
cretan
colony
which
is
introduced
in
the
preface
to
the
laws
but
soon
falls
into
the
background
the
beautiful
but
rather
artificial
tale
of
prometheus
and
epimetheus
narrated
in
his
rhetorical
manner
by
protagoras
in
the
dialogue
called
after
him
the
speech
at
the
beginning
of
the
phaedrus
which
is
a
parody
of
the
orator
lysias
the
rival
speech
of
socrates
and
the
recantation
of
it
to
these
may
be
added
the
tale
of
the
grasshoppers
and
the
tale
of
thamus
and
of
theuth
both
in
the
phaedrus
the
parable
of
the
cave
republic
in
which
the
previous
argument
is
recapitulated
and
the
nature
and
degrees
of
knowledge
having
been
previously
set
forth
in
the
abstract
are
represented
in
a
picture
the
fiction
of
the
men
republic
compare
laws
in
which
by
the
adaptation
of
an
old
tradition
plato
makes
a
new
beginning
for
his
society
the
myth
of
aristophanes
respecting
the
division
of
the
sexes
sym
the
parable
of
the
noble
captain
the
pilot
and
the
mutinous
sailors
republic
in
which
is
represented
the
relation
of
the
better
part
of
the
world
and
of
the
philosopher
to
the
mob
of
politicians
the
ironical
tale
of
the
pilot
who
plies
between
athens
and
aegina
charging
only
a
small
payment
for
saving
men
from
death
the
reason
being
that
he
is
uncertain
whether
to
live
or
die
is
better
for
them
gor
the
treatment
of
freemen
and
citizens
by
physicians
and
of
slaves
by
their
apprentices
a
somewhat
laboured
figure
of
speech
intended
to
illustrate
the
two
different
ways
in
which
the
laws
speak
to
men
laws
there
also
occur
in
plato
continuous
images
some
of
them
extend
over
several
pages
appearing
and
reappearing
at
intervals
such
as
the
bees
stinging
and
stingless
paupers
and
thieves
in
the
eighth
book
of
the
republic
who
are
generated
in
the
transition
from
timocracy
to
oligarchy
the
sun
which
is
to
the
visible
world
what
the
idea
of
good
is
to
the
intellectual
in
the
sixth
book
of
the
republic
the
composite
animal
having
the
form
of
a
man
but
containing
under
a
human
skin
a
lion
and
a
monster
republic
the
great
beast
the
populace
and
the
wild
beast
within
us
meaning
the
passions
which
are
always
liable
to
break
out
the
animated
comparisons
of
the
degradation
of
philosophy
by
the
arts
to
the
dishonoured
maiden
and
of
the
tyrant
to
the
parricide
who
his
father
having
first
taken
away
his
arms
the
dog
who
is
your
only
philosopher
the
grotesque
and
rather
paltry
image
of
the
argument
wandering
about
without
a
head
laws
which
is
repeated
not
improved
from
the
gorgias
the
argument
personified
as
veiling
her
face
republic
as
engaged
in
a
chase
as
breaking
upon
us
in
a
first
second
and
third
wave
on
these
figures
of
speech
the
changes
are
rung
many
times
over
it
is
observable
that
nearly
all
these
parables
or
continuous
images
are
found
in
the
republic
that
which
occurs
in
the
theaetetus
of
the
midwifery
of
socrates
is
perhaps
the
only
exception
to
make
the
list
complete
the
mathematical
figure
of
the
number
of
the
state
republic
or
the
numerical
interval
which
separates
king
from
tyrant
should
not
be
forgotten
the
myth
in
the
gorgias
is
one
of
those
descriptions
of
another
life
which
like
the
sixth
aeneid
of
virgil
appear
to
contain
reminiscences
of
the
mysteries
it
is
a
vision
of
the
rewards
and
punishments
which
await
good
and
bad
men
after
death
it
supposes
the
body
to
continue
and
to
be
in
another
world
what
it
has
become
in
this
it
includes
a
paradiso
purgatorio
and
inferno
like
the
sister
myths
of
the
phaedo
and
the
republic
the
inferno
is
reserved
for
great
criminals
only
the
argument
of
the
dialogue
is
frequently
referred
to
and
the
meaning
breaks
through
so
as
rather
to
destroy
the
liveliness
and
consistency
of
the
picture
the
structure
of
the
fiction
is
very
slight
the
chief
point
or
moral
being
that
in
the
judgments
of
another
world
there
is
no
possibility
of
concealment
zeus
has
taken
from
men
the
power
of
foreseeing
death
and
brings
together
the
souls
both
of
them
and
their
judges
naked
and
undisguised
at
the
both
are
exposed
to
view
stripped
of
the
veils
and
clothes
which
might
prevent
them
from
seeing
into
or
being
seen
by
one
another
the
myth
of
the
phaedo
is
of
the
same
type
but
it
is
more
cosmological
and
also
more
poetical
the
beautiful
and
ingenious
fancy
occurs
to
plato
that
the
upper
atmosphere
is
an
earth
and
heaven
in
one
a
glorified
earth
fairer
and
purer
than
that
in
which
we
dwell
as
the
fishes
live
in
the
ocean
mankind
are
living
in
a
lower
sphere
out
of
which
they
put
their
heads
for
a
moment
or
two
and
behold
a
world
beyond
the
earth
which
we
inhabit
is
a
sediment
of
the
coarser
particles
which
drop
from
the
world
above
and
is
to
that
heavenly
earth
what
the
desert
and
the
shores
of
the
ocean
are
to
us
a
part
of
the
myth
consists
of
description
of
the
interior
of
the
earth
which
gives
the
opportunity
of
introducing
several
mythological
names
and
of
providing
places
of
torment
for
the
wicked
there
is
no
clear
distinction
of
soul
and
body
the
spirits
beneath
the
earth
are
spoken
of
as
souls
only
yet
they
retain
a
sort
of
shadowy
form
when
they
cry
for
mercy
on
the
shores
of
the
lake
and
the
philosopher
alone
is
said
to
have
got
rid
of
the
body
all
the
three
myths
in
plato
which
relate
to
the
world
below
have
a
place
for
repentant
sinners
as
well
as
other
homes
or
places
for
the
very
good
and
very
bad
it
is
a
natural
reflection
which
is
made
by
plato
elsewhere
that
the
two
extremes
of
human
character
are
rarely
met
with
and
that
the
generality
of
mankind
are
between
them
hence
a
place
must
be
found
for
them
in
the
myth
of
the
phaedo
they
are
carried
down
the
river
acheron
to
the
acherusian
lake
where
they
dwell
and
are
purified
of
their
evil
deeds
and
receive
the
rewards
of
their
good
there
are
also
incurable
sinners
who
are
cast
into
tartarus
there
to
remain
as
the
penalty
of
atrocious
crimes
these
suffer
everlastingly
and
there
is
another
class
of
sinners
who
are
allowed
from
time
to
time
to
approach
the
shores
of
the
acherusian
lake
where
they
cry
to
their
victims
for
mercy
which
if
they
obtain
they
come
out
into
the
lake
and
cease
from
their
torments
neither
this
nor
any
of
the
three
greater
myths
of
plato
nor
perhaps
any
allegory
or
parable
relating
to
the
unseen
world
is
consistent
with
itself
the
language
of
philosophy
mingles
with
that
of
mythology
abstract
ideas
are
transformed
into
persons
figures
of
speech
into
realities
these
myths
may
be
compared
with
the
pilgrim
progress
of
bunyan
in
which
discussions
of
theology
are
mixed
up
with
the
incidents
of
travel
and
mythological
personages
are
associated
with
human
beings
they
are
also
garnished
with
names
and
phrases
taken
out
of
homer
and
with
other
fragments
of
greek
tradition
the
myth
of
the
republic
is
more
subtle
and
also
more
consistent
than
either
of
the
two
others
it
has
a
greater
verisimilitude
than
they
have
and
is
full
of
touches
which
recall
the
experiences
of
human
life
it
will
be
noticed
by
an
attentive
reader
that
the
twelve
days
during
which
er
lay
in
a
trance
after
he
was
slain
coincide
with
the
time
passed
by
the
spirits
in
their
pilgrimage
it
is
a
curious
observation
not
often
made
that
good
men
who
have
lived
in
a
city
shall
we
say
in
a
religious
and
respectable
society
are
more
likely
to
make
mistakes
in
their
choice
of
life
than
those
who
have
had
more
experience
of
the
world
and
of
evil
it
is
a
more
familiar
remark
that
we
constantly
blame
others
when
we
have
only
ourselves
to
blame
and
the
philosopher
must
acknowledge
however
reluctantly
that
there
is
an
element
of
chance
in
human
life
with
which
it
is
sometimes
impossible
for
man
to
cope
that
men
drink
more
of
the
waters
of
forgetfulness
than
is
good
for
them
is
a
poetical
description
of
a
familiar
truth
we
have
many
of
us
known
men
who
like
odysseus
have
wearied
of
ambition
and
have
only
desired
rest
we
should
like
to
know
what
became
of
the
infants
almost
as
soon
as
they
were
born
but
plato
only
raises
without
satisfying
our
curiosity
the
two
companies
of
souls
ascending
and
descending
at
either
chasm
of
heaven
and
earth
and
conversing
when
they
come
out
into
the
meadow
the
majestic
figures
of
the
judges
sitting
in
heaven
the
voice
heard
by
ardiaeus
are
features
of
the
great
allegory
which
have
an
indescribable
grandeur
and
power
the
remark
already
made
respecting
the
inconsistency
of
the
two
other
myths
must
be
extended
also
to
this
it
is
at
once
an
orrery
or
model
of
the
heavens
and
a
picture
of
the
day
of
judgment
the
three
myths
are
unlike
anything
else
in
plato
there
is
an
oriental
or
rather
an
egyptian
element
in
them
and
they
have
an
affinity
to
the
mysteries
and
to
the
orphic
modes
of
worship
to
a
certain
extent
they
are
at
any
rate
there
is
hardly
anything
like
them
in
other
greek
writings
which
have
a
serious
purpose
in
spirit
they
are
mediaeval
they
are
akin
to
what
may
be
termed
the
underground
religion
in
all
ages
and
countries
they
are
presented
in
the
most
lively
and
graphic
manner
but
they
are
never
insisted
on
as
true
it
is
only
affirmed
that
nothing
better
can
be
said
about
a
future
life
plato
seems
to
make
use
of
them
when
he
has
reached
the
limits
of
human
knowledge
or
to
borrow
an
expression
of
his
own
when
he
is
standing
on
the
outside
of
the
intellectual
world
they
are
very
simple
in
style
a
few
touches
bring
the
picture
home
to
the
mind
and
make
it
present
to
us
they
have
also
a
kind
of
authority
gained
by
the
employment
of
sacred
and
familiar
names
just
as
mere
fragments
of
the
words
of
scripture
put
together
in
any
form
and
applied
to
any
subject
have
a
power
of
their
own
they
are
a
substitute
for
poetry
and
mythology
and
they
are
also
a
reform
of
mythology
the
moral
of
them
may
be
summed
up
in
a
word
or
two
after
death
the
judgment
and
is
some
better
thing
remaining
for
the
good
than
for
the
evil
all
literature
gathers
into
itself
many
elements
of
the
past
for
example
the
tale
of
the
men
in
the
republic
appears
at
first
sight
to
be
an
extravagant
fancy
but
it
is
restored
to
propriety
when
we
remember
that
it
is
based
on
a
legendary
belief
the
art
of
making
stories
of
ghosts
and
apparitions
credible
is
said
to
consist
in
the
manner
of
telling
them
the
effect
is
gained
by
many
literary
and
conversational
devices
such
as
the
previous
raising
of
curiosity
the
mention
of
little
circumstances
simplicity
picturesqueness
the
naturalness
of
the
occasion
and
the
like
this
art
is
possessed
by
plato
in
a
degree
which
has
never
been
equalled
the
myth
in
the
phaedrus
is
even
greater
than
the
myths
which
have
been
already
described
but
is
of
a
different
character
it
treats
of
a
former
rather
than
of
a
future
life
it
represents
the
conflict
of
reason
aided
by
passion
or
righteous
indignation
on
the
one
hand
and
of
the
animal
lusts
and
instincts
on
the
other
the
soul
of
man
has
followed
the
company
of
some
god
and
seen
truth
in
the
form
of
the
universal
before
it
was
born
in
this
world
our
present
life
is
the
result
of
the
struggle
which
was
then
carried
on
this
world
is
relative
to
a
former
world
as
it
is
often
projected
into
a
future
we
ask
the
question
where
were
men
before
birth
as
we
likewise
enquire
what
will
become
of
them
after
death
the
first
question
is
unfamiliar
to
us
and
therefore
seems
to
be
unnatural
but
if
we
survey
the
whole
human
race
it
has
been
as
influential
and
as
widely
spread
as
the
other
in
the
phaedrus
it
is
really
a
figure
of
speech
in
which
the
combat
of
this
life
is
represented
the
majesty
and
power
of
the
whole
passage
especially
of
what
may
be
called
the
theme
or
proem
beginning
mind
through
all
her
being
is
immortal
can
only
be
rendered
very
inadequately
in
another
language
the
myth
in
the
statesman
relates
to
a
former
cycle
of
existence
in
which
men
were
born
of
the
earth
and
by
the
reversal
of
the
motion
had
their
lives
reversed
and
were
restored
to
youth
and
beauty
the
dead
came
to
life
the
old
grew
and
the
young
the
youth
became
a
child
the
child
an
infant
the
infant
vanished
into
the
earth
the
connection
between
the
reversal
of
the
earth
motion
and
the
reversal
of
human
life
is
of
course
verbal
only
yet
plato
like
theologians
in
other
ages
argues
from
the
consistency
of
the
tale
to
its
truth
the
new
order
of
the
world
was
immediately
under
the
government
of
god
it
was
a
state
of
innocence
in
which
men
had
neither
wants
nor
cares
in
which
the
earth
brought
forth
all
things
spontaneously
and
god
was
to
man
what
man
now
is
to
the
animals
there
were
no
great
estates
or
families
or
private
possessions
nor
any
traditions
of
the
past
because
men
were
all
born
out
of
the
earth
this
is
what
plato
calls
the
of
cronos
and
in
like
manner
he
connects
the
reversal
of
the
earth
motion
with
some
legend
of
which
he
himself
was
probably
the
inventor
the
question
is
then
asked
under
which
of
these
two
cycles
of
existence
was
man
the
happier
under
that
of
cronos
which
was
a
state
of
innocence
or
that
of
zeus
which
is
our
ordinary
life
for
a
while
plato
balances
the
two
sides
of
the
serious
controversy
which
he
has
suggested
in
a
figure
the
answer
depends
on
another
question
what
use
did
the
children
of
cronos
make
of
their
time
they
had
boundless
leisure
and
the
faculty
of
discoursing
not
only
with
one
another
but
with
the
animals
did
they
employ
these
advantages
with
a
view
to
philosophy
gathering
from
every
nature
some
addition
to
their
store
of
knowledge
or
did
they
pass
their
time
in
eating
and
drinking
and
telling
stories
to
one
another
and
to
the
beasts
in
either
case
there
would
be
no
difficulty
in
answering
but
then
as
plato
rather
mischievously
adds
knows
what
they
did
and
therefore
the
doubt
must
remain
undetermined
to
the
first
there
succeeds
a
second
epoch
after
another
natural
convulsion
in
which
the
order
of
the
world
and
of
human
life
is
once
more
reversed
god
withdraws
his
guiding
hand
and
man
is
left
to
the
government
of
himself
the
world
begins
again
and
arts
and
laws
are
slowly
and
painfully
invented
a
secular
age
succeeds
to
a
theocratical
in
this
fanciful
tale
plato
has
dropped
or
almost
dropped
the
garb
of
mythology
he
suggests
several
curious
and
important
thoughts
such
as
the
possibility
of
a
state
of
innocence
the
existence
of
a
world
without
traditions
and
the
difference
between
human
and
divine
government
he
has
also
carried
a
step
further
his
speculations
concerning
the
abolition
of
the
family
and
of
property
which
he
supposes
to
have
no
place
among
the
children
of
cronos
any
more
than
in
the
ideal
state
it
is
characteristic
of
plato
and
of
his
age
to
pass
from
the
abstract
to
the
concrete
from
poetry
to
reality
language
is
the
expression
of
the
seen
and
also
of
the
unseen
and
moves
in
a
region
between
them
a
great
writer
knows
how
to
strike
both
these
chords
sometimes
remaining
within
the
sphere
of
the
visible
and
then
again
comprehending
a
wider
range
and
soaring
to
the
abstract
and
universal
even
in
the
same
sentence
he
may
employ
both
modes
of
speech
not
improperly
or
inharmoniously
it
is
useless
to
criticise
the
broken
metaphors
of
plato
if
the
effect
of
the
whole
is
to
create
a
picture
not
such
as
can
be
painted
on
canvas
but
which
is
full
of
life
and
meaning
to
the
reader
a
poem
may
be
contained
in
a
word
or
two
which
may
call
up
not
one
but
many
latent
images
or
half
reveal
to
us
by
a
sudden
flash
the
thoughts
of
many
hearts
often
the
rapid
transition
from
one
image
to
another
is
pleasing
to
us
on
the
other
hand
any
single
figure
of
speech
if
too
often
repeated
or
worked
out
too
much
at
length
becomes
prosy
and
monotonous
in
theology
and
philosophy
we
necessarily
include
both
moral
law
within
and
the
starry
heaven
above
and
pass
from
one
to
the
other
compare
for
examples
psalms
xviii
and
whether
such
a
use
of
language
is
puerile
or
noble
depends
upon
the
genius
of
the
writer
or
speaker
and
the
familiarity
of
the
associations
employed
in
the
myths
and
parables
of
plato
the
ease
and
grace
of
conversation
is
not
forgotten
they
are
spoken
not
written
words
stories
which
are
told
to
a
living
audience
and
so
well
told
that
we
are
more
than
to
believe
them
compare
phaedrus
as
in
conversation
too
the
striking
image
or
figure
of
speech
is
not
forgotten
but
is
quickly
caught
up
and
alluded
to
again
and
again
as
it
would
still
be
in
our
own
day
in
a
genial
and
sympathetic
society
the
descriptions
of
plato
have
a
greater
life
and
reality
than
is
to
be
found
in
any
modern
writing
this
is
due
to
their
homeliness
and
simplicity
plato
can
do
with
words
just
as
he
pleases
to
him
they
are
indeed
plastic
than
wax
republic
we
are
in
the
habit
of
opposing
speech
and
writing
poetry
and
prose
but
he
has
discovered
a
use
of
language
in
which
they
are
united
which
gives
a
fitting
expression
to
the
highest
truths
and
in
which
the
trifles
of
courtesy
and
the
familiarities
of
daily
life
are
not
overlooked
gorgias
by
plato
translated
by
benjamin
jowett
persons
of
the
dialogue
callicles
socrates
chaerephon
gorgias
polus
scene
the
house
of
callicles
callicles
the
wise
man
as
the
proverb
says
is
late
for
a
fray
but
not
for
a
feast
socrates
and
are
we
late
for
a
feast
callicles
yes
and
a
delightful
feast
for
gorgias
has
just
been
exhibiting
to
us
many
fine
things
socrates
it
is
not
my
fault
callicles
our
friend
chaerephon
is
to
blame
for
he
would
keep
us
loitering
in
the
agora
chaerephon
never
mind
socrates
the
misfortune
of
which
i
have
been
the
cause
i
will
also
repair
for
gorgias
is
a
friend
of
mine
and
i
will
make
him
give
the
exhibition
again
either
now
or
if
you
prefer
at
some
other
time
callicles
what
is
the
matter
chaerephon
does
socrates
want
to
hear
gorgias
chaerephon
yes
that
was
our
intention
in
coming
callicles
come
into
my
house
then
for
gorgias
is
staying
with
me
and
he
shall
exhibit
to
you
socrates
very
good
callicles
but
will
he
answer
our
questions
for
i
want
to
hear
from
him
what
is
the
nature
of
his
art
and
what
it
is
which
he
professes
and
teaches
he
may
as
you
chaerephon
suggest
defer
the
exhibition
to
some
other
time
callicles
there
is
nothing
like
asking
him
socrates
and
indeed
to
answer
questions
is
a
part
of
his
exhibition
for
he
was
saying
only
just
now
that
any
one
in
my
house
might
put
any
question
to
him
and
that
he
would
answer
socrates
how
fortunate
will
you
ask
him
chaerephon
chaerephon
what
shall
i
ask
him
socrates
ask
him
who
he
is
chaerephon
what
do
you
mean
socrates
i
mean
such
a
question
as
would
elicit
from
him
if
he
had
been
a
maker
of
shoes
the
answer
that
he
is
a
cobbler
do
you
understand
chaerephon
i
understand
and
will
ask
him
tell
me
gorgias
is
our
friend
callicles
right
in
saying
that
you
undertake
to
answer
any
questions
which
you
are
asked
gorgias
quite
right
chaerephon
i
was
saying
as
much
only
just
now
and
i
may
add
that
many
years
have
elapsed
since
any
one
has
asked
me
a
new
one
chaerephon
then
you
must
be
very
ready
gorgias
gorgias
of
that
chaerephon
you
can
make
trial
polus
yes
indeed
and
if
you
like
chaerephon
you
may
make
trial
of
me
too
for
i
think
that
gorgias
who
has
been
talking
a
long
time
is
tired
chaerephon
and
do
you
polus
think
that
you
can
answer
better
than
gorgias
polus
what
does
that
matter
if
i
answer
well
enough
for
you
chaerephon
not
at
all
and
you
shall
answer
if
you
like
polus
ask
chaerephon
my
question
is
this
if
gorgias
had
the
skill
of
his
brother
herodicus
what
ought
we
to
call
him
ought
he
not
to
have
the
name
which
is
given
to
his
brother
polus
certainly
chaerephon
then
we
should
be
right
in
calling
him
a
physician
polus
yes
chaerephon
and
if
he
had
the
skill
of
aristophon
the
son
of
aglaophon
or
of
his
brother
polygnotus
what
ought
we
to
call
him
polus
clearly
a
painter
chaerephon
but
now
what
shall
we
call
him
what
is
the
art
in
which
he
is
skilled
polus
o
chaerephon
there
are
many
arts
among
mankind
which
are
experimental
and
have
their
origin
in
experience
for
experience
makes
the
days
of
men
to
proceed
according
to
art
and
inexperience
according
to
chance
and
different
persons
in
different
ways
are
proficient
in
different
arts
and
the
best
persons
in
the
best
arts
and
our
friend
gorgias
is
one
of
the
best
and
the
art
in
which
he
is
a
proficient
is
the
noblest
socrates
polus
has
been
taught
how
to
make
a
capital
speech
gorgias
but
he
is
not
fulfilling
the
promise
which
he
made
to
chaerephon
gorgias
what
do
you
mean
socrates
socrates
i
mean
that
he
has
not
exactly
answered
the
question
which
he
was
asked
gorgias
then
why
not
ask
him
yourself
socrates
but
i
would
much
rather
ask
you
if
you
are
disposed
to
answer
for
i
see
from
the
few
words
which
polus
has
uttered
that
he
has
attended
more
to
the
art
which
is
called
rhetoric
than
to
dialectic
polus
what
makes
you
say
so
socrates
socrates
because
polus
when
chaerephon
asked
you
what
was
the
art
which
gorgias
knows
you
praised
it
as
if
you
were
answering
some
one
who
found
fault
with
it
but
you
never
said
what
the
art
was
polus
why
did
i
not
say
that
it
was
the
noblest
of
arts
socrates
yes
indeed
but
that
was
no
answer
to
the
question
nobody
asked
what
was
the
quality
but
what
was
the
nature
of
the
art
and
by
what
name
we
were
to
describe
gorgias
and
i
would
still
beg
you
briefly
and
clearly
as
you
answered
chaerephon
when
he
asked
you
at
first
to
say
what
this
art
is
and
what
we
ought
to
call
gorgias
or
rather
gorgias
let
me
turn
to
you
and
ask
the
same
question
what
are
we
to
call
you
and
what
is
the
art
which
you
profess
gorgias
rhetoric
socrates
is
my
art
socrates
then
i
am
to
call
you
a
rhetorician
gorgias
yes
socrates
and
a
good
one
too
if
you
would
call
me
that
which
in
homeric
language
boast
myself
to
be
socrates
i
should
wish
to
do
so
gorgias
then
pray
do
socrates
and
are
we
to
say
that
you
are
able
to
make
other
men
rhetoricians
gorgias
yes
that
is
exactly
what
i
profess
to
make
them
not
only
at
athens
but
in
all
places
socrates
and
will
you
continue
to
ask
and
answer
questions
gorgias
as
we
are
at
present
doing
and
reserve
for
another
occasion
the
longer
mode
of
speech
which
polus
was
attempting
will
you
keep
your
promise
and
answer
shortly
the
questions
which
are
asked
of
you
gorgias
some
answers
socrates
are
of
necessity
longer
but
i
will
do
my
best
to
make
them
as
short
as
possible
for
a
part
of
my
profession
is
that
i
can
be
as
short
as
any
one
socrates
that
is
what
is
wanted
gorgias
exhibit
the
shorter
method
now
and
the
longer
one
at
some
other
time
gorgias
well
i
will
and
you
will
certainly
say
that
you
never
heard
a
man
use
fewer
words
socrates
very
good
then
as
you
profess
to
be
a
rhetorician
and
a
maker
of
rhetoricians
let
me
ask
you
with
what
is
rhetoric
concerned
i
might
ask
with
what
is
weaving
concerned
and
you
would
reply
would
you
not
with
the
making
of
garments
gorgias
yes
socrates
and
music
is
concerned
with
the
composition
of
melodies
gorgias
it
is
socrates
by
here
gorgias
i
admire
the
surpassing
brevity
of
your
answers
gorgias
yes
socrates
i
do
think
myself
good
at
that
socrates
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
answer
me
in
like
manner
about
rhetoric
with
what
is
rhetoric
concerned
gorgias
with
discourse
socrates
what
sort
of
discourse
gorgias
such
discourse
as
would
teach
the
sick
under
what
treatment
they
might
get
well
gorgias
no
socrates
then
rhetoric
does
not
treat
of
all
kinds
of
discourse
gorgias
certainly
not
socrates
and
yet
rhetoric
makes
men
able
to
speak
gorgias
yes
socrates
and
to
understand
that
about
which
they
speak
gorgias
of
course
socrates
but
does
not
the
art
of
medicine
which
we
were
just
now
mentioning
also
make
men
able
to
understand
and
speak
about
the
sick
gorgias
certainly
socrates
then
medicine
also
treats
of
discourse
gorgias
yes
socrates
of
discourse
concerning
diseases
gorgias
just
so
socrates
and
does
not
gymnastic
also
treat
of
discourse
concerning
the
good
or
evil
condition
of
the
body
gorgias
very
true
socrates
and
the
same
gorgias
is
true
of
the
other
arts
all
of
them
treat
of
discourse
concerning
the
subjects
with
which
they
severally
have
to
do
gorgias
clearly
socrates
then
why
if
you
call
rhetoric
the
art
which
treats
of
discourse
and
all
the
other
arts
treat
of
discourse
do
you
not
call
them
arts
of
rhetoric
gorgias
because
socrates
the
knowledge
of
the
other
arts
has
only
to
do
with
some
sort
of
external
action
as
of
the
hand
but
there
is
no
such
action
of
the
hand
in
rhetoric
which
works
and
takes
effect
only
through
the
medium
of
discourse
and
therefore
i
am
justified
in
saying
that
rhetoric
treats
of
discourse
socrates
i
am
not
sure
whether
i
entirely
understand
you
but
i
dare
say
i
shall
soon
know
better
please
to
answer
me
a
question
you
would
allow
that
there
are
arts
gorgias
yes
socrates
as
to
the
arts
generally
they
are
for
the
most
part
concerned
with
doing
and
require
little
or
no
speaking
in
painting
and
statuary
and
many
other
arts
the
work
may
proceed
in
silence
and
of
such
arts
i
suppose
you
would
say
that
they
do
not
come
within
the
province
of
rhetoric
gorgias
you
perfectly
conceive
my
meaning
socrates
socrates
but
there
are
other
arts
which
work
wholly
through
the
medium
of
language
and
require
either
no
action
or
very
little
as
for
example
the
arts
of
arithmetic
of
calculation
of
geometry
and
of
playing
draughts
in
some
of
these
speech
is
pretty
nearly
with
action
but
in
most
of
them
the
verbal
element
is
greater
they
depend
wholly
on
words
for
their
efficacy
and
power
and
i
take
your
meaning
to
be
that
rhetoric
is
an
art
of
this
latter
sort
gorgias
exactly
socrates
and
yet
i
do
not
believe
that
you
really
mean
to
call
any
of
these
arts
rhetoric
although
the
precise
expression
which
you
used
was
that
rhetoric
is
an
art
which
works
and
takes
effect
only
through
the
medium
of
discourse
and
an
adversary
who
wished
to
be
captious
might
say
so
gorgias
you
call
arithmetic
rhetoric
but
i
do
not
think
that
you
really
call
arithmetic
rhetoric
any
more
than
geometry
would
be
so
called
by
you
gorgias
you
are
quite
right
socrates
in
your
apprehension
of
my
meaning
socrates
well
then
let
me
now
have
the
rest
of
my
answer
seeing
that
rhetoric
is
one
of
those
arts
which
works
mainly
by
the
use
of
words
and
there
are
other
arts
which
also
use
words
tell
me
what
is
that
quality
in
words
with
which
rhetoric
is
concerned
suppose
that
a
person
asks
me
about
some
of
the
arts
which
i
was
mentioning
just
now
he
might
say
what
is
arithmetic
and
i
should
reply
to
him
as
you
replied
to
me
that
arithmetic
is
one
of
those
arts
which
take
effect
through
words
and
then
he
would
proceed
to
ask
about
what
and
i
should
reply
words
about
odd
and
even
numbers
and
how
many
there
are
of
each
and
if
he
asked
again
is
the
art
of
calculation
i
should
say
that
also
is
one
of
the
arts
which
is
concerned
wholly
with
words
and
if
he
further
said
with
what
i
should
say
like
the
clerks
in
the
assembly
aforesaid
of
arithmetic
but
with
a
difference
the
difference
being
that
the
art
of
calculation
considers
not
only
the
quantities
of
odd
and
even
numbers
but
also
their
numerical
relations
to
themselves
and
to
one
another
and
suppose
again
i
were
to
say
that
astronomy
is
only
words
he
would
ask
about
what
socrates
and
i
should
answer
that
astronomy
tells
us
about
the
motions
of
the
stars
and
sun
and
moon
and
their
relative
swiftness
gorgias
you
would
be
quite
right
socrates
socrates
and
now
let
us
have
from
you
gorgias
the
truth
about
rhetoric
which
you
would
admit
would
you
not
to
be
one
of
those
arts
which
act
always
and
fulfil
all
their
ends
through
the
medium
of
words
gorgias
true
socrates
words
which
do
what
i
should
ask
to
what
class
of
things
do
the
words
which
rhetoric
uses
relate
gorgias
to
the
greatest
socrates
and
the
best
of
human
things
socrates
that
again
gorgias
is
ambiguous
i
am
still
in
the
dark
for
which
are
the
greatest
and
best
of
human
things
i
dare
say
that
you
have
heard
men
singing
at
feasts
the
old
drinking
song
in
which
the
singers
enumerate
the
goods
of
life
first
health
beauty
next
thirdly
as
the
writer
of
the
song
says
wealth
honestly
obtained
gorgias
yes
i
know
the
song
but
what
is
your
drift
socrates
i
mean
to
say
that
the
producers
of
those
things
which
the
author
of
the
song
praises
that
is
to
say
the
physician
the
trainer
the
will
at
once
come
to
you
and
first
the
physician
will
say
socrates
gorgias
is
deceiving
you
for
my
art
is
concerned
with
the
greatest
good
of
men
and
not
his
and
when
i
ask
who
are
you
he
will
reply
am
a
physician
what
do
you
mean
i
shall
say
do
you
mean
that
your
art
produces
the
greatest
good
he
will
answer
is
not
health
the
greatest
good
what
greater
good
can
men
have
socrates
and
after
him
the
trainer
will
come
and
say
too
socrates
shall
be
greatly
surprised
if
gorgias
can
show
more
good
of
his
art
than
i
can
show
of
mine
to
him
again
i
shall
say
who
are
you
honest
friend
and
what
is
your
business
am
a
trainer
he
will
reply
my
business
is
to
make
men
beautiful
and
strong
in
body
when
i
have
done
with
the
trainer
there
arrives
the
and
he
as
i
expect
will
utterly
despise
them
all
socrates
he
will
say
gorgias
or
any
one
else
can
produce
any
greater
good
than
wealth
well
you
and
i
say
to
him
and
are
you
a
creator
of
wealth
he
replies
and
who
are
you
and
do
you
consider
wealth
to
be
the
greatest
good
of
man
course
will
be
his
reply
and
we
shall
rejoin
yes
but
our
friend
gorgias
contends
that
his
art
produces
a
greater
good
than
yours
and
then
he
will
be
sure
to
go
on
and
ask
good
let
gorgias
answer
now
i
want
you
gorgias
to
imagine
that
this
question
is
asked
of
you
by
them
and
by
me
what
is
that
which
as
you
say
is
the
greatest
good
of
man
and
of
which
you
are
the
creator
answer
us
gorgias
that
good
socrates
which
is
truly
the
greatest
being
that
which
gives
to
men
freedom
in
their
own
persons
and
to
individuals
the
power
of
ruling
over
others
in
their
several
states
socrates
and
what
would
you
consider
this
to
be
gorgias
what
is
there
greater
than
the
word
which
persuades
the
judges
in
the
courts
or
the
senators
in
the
council
or
the
citizens
in
the
assembly
or
at
any
other
political
meeting
if
you
have
the
power
of
uttering
this
word
you
will
have
the
physician
your
slave
and
the
trainer
your
slave
and
the
of
whom
you
talk
will
be
found
to
gather
treasures
not
for
himself
but
for
you
who
are
able
to
speak
and
to
persuade
the
multitude
socrates
now
i
think
gorgias
that
you
have
very
accurately
explained
what
you
conceive
to
be
the
art
of
rhetoric
and
you
mean
to
say
if
i
am
not
mistaken
that
rhetoric
is
the
artificer
of
persuasion
having
this
and
no
other
business
and
that
this
is
her
crown
and
end
do
you
know
any
other
effect
of
rhetoric
over
and
above
that
of
producing
persuasion
gorgias
no
the
definition
seems
to
me
very
fair
socrates
for
persuasion
is
the
chief
end
of
rhetoric
socrates
then
hear
me
gorgias
for
i
am
quite
sure
that
if
there
ever
was
a
man
who
entered
on
the
discussion
of
a
matter
from
a
pure
love
of
knowing
the
truth
i
am
such
a
one
and
i
should
say
the
same
of
you
gorgias
what
is
coming
socrates
socrates
i
will
tell
you
i
am
very
well
aware
that
i
do
not
know
what
according
to
you
is
the
exact
nature
or
what
are
the
topics
of
that
persuasion
of
which
you
speak
and
which
is
given
by
rhetoric
although
i
have
a
suspicion
about
both
the
one
and
the
other
and
i
am
going
to
ask
what
is
this
power
of
persuasion
which
is
given
by
rhetoric
and
about
what
but
why
if
i
have
a
suspicion
do
i
ask
instead
of
telling
you
not
for
your
sake
but
in
order
that
the
argument
may
proceed
in
such
a
manner
as
is
most
likely
to
set
forth
the
truth
and
i
would
have
you
observe
that
i
am
right
in
asking
this
further
question
if
i
asked
sort
of
a
painter
is
zeuxis
and
you
said
painter
of
figures
should
i
not
be
right
in
asking
kind
of
figures
and
where
do
you
find
them
gorgias
certainly
socrates
and
the
reason
for
asking
this
second
question
would
be
that
there
are
other
painters
besides
who
paint
many
other
figures
gorgias
true
socrates
but
if
there
had
been
no
one
but
zeuxis
who
painted
them
then
you
would
have
answered
very
well
gorgias
quite
so
socrates
now
i
want
to
know
about
rhetoric
in
the
same
way
is
rhetoric
the
only
art
which
brings
persuasion
or
do
other
arts
have
the
same
effect
i
mean
to
say
does
he
who
teaches
anything
persuade
men
of
that
which
he
teaches
or
not
gorgias
he
persuades
socrates
there
can
be
no
mistake
about
that
socrates
again
if
we
take
the
arts
of
which
we
were
just
now
speaking
do
not
arithmetic
and
the
arithmeticians
teach
us
the
properties
of
number
gorgias
certainly
socrates
and
therefore
persuade
us
of
them
gorgias
yes
socrates
then
arithmetic
as
well
as
rhetoric
is
an
artificer
of
persuasion
gorgias
clearly
socrates
and
if
any
one
asks
us
what
sort
of
persuasion
and
about
what
we
shall
answer
persuasion
which
teaches
the
quantity
of
odd
and
even
and
we
shall
be
able
to
show
that
all
the
other
arts
of
which
we
were
just
now
speaking
are
artificers
of
persuasion
and
of
what
sort
and
about
what
gorgias
very
true
socrates
then
rhetoric
is
not
the
only
artificer
of
persuasion
gorgias
true
socrates
seeing
then
that
not
only
rhetoric
works
by
persuasion
but
that
other
arts
do
the
same
as
in
the
case
of
the
painter
a
question
has
arisen
which
is
a
very
fair
one
of
what
persuasion
is
rhetoric
the
artificer
and
about
what
is
not
that
a
fair
way
of
putting
the
question
gorgias
i
think
so
socrates
then
if
you
approve
the
question
gorgias
what
is
the
answer
gorgias
i
answer
socrates
that
rhetoric
is
the
art
of
persuasion
in
courts
of
law
and
other
assemblies
as
i
was
just
now
saying
and
about
the
just
and
unjust
socrates
and
that
gorgias
was
what
i
was
suspecting
to
be
your
notion
yet
i
would
not
have
you
wonder
if
i
am
found
repeating
a
seemingly
plain
question
for
i
ask
not
in
order
to
confute
you
but
as
i
was
saying
that
the
argument
may
proceed
consecutively
and
that
we
may
not
get
the
habit
of
anticipating
and
suspecting
the
meaning
of
one
another
words
i
would
have
you
develope
your
own
views
in
your
own
way
whatever
may
be
your
hypothesis
gorgias
i
think
that
you
are
quite
right
socrates
socrates
then
let
me
raise
another
question
there
is
such
a
thing
as
learned
gorgias
yes
socrates
and
there
is
also
believed
gorgias
yes
socrates
and
is
the
learned
the
same
as
believed
and
are
learning
and
belief
the
same
things
gorgias
in
my
judgment
socrates
they
are
not
the
same
socrates
and
your
judgment
is
right
as
you
may
ascertain
in
this
way
if
a
person
were
to
say
to
you
there
gorgias
a
false
belief
as
well
as
a
true
you
would
reply
if
i
am
not
mistaken
that
there
is
gorgias
yes
socrates
well
but
is
there
a
false
knowledge
as
well
as
a
true
gorgias
no
socrates
no
indeed
and
this
again
proves
that
knowledge
and
belief
differ
gorgias
very
true
socrates
and
yet
those
who
have
learned
as
well
as
those
who
have
believed
are
persuaded
gorgias
just
so
socrates
shall
we
then
assume
two
sorts
of
persuasion
one
which
is
the
source
of
belief
without
knowledge
as
the
other
is
of
knowledge
gorgias
by
all
means
socrates
and
which
sort
of
persuasion
does
rhetoric
create
in
courts
of
law
and
other
assemblies
about
the
just
and
unjust
the
sort
of
persuasion
which
gives
belief
without
knowledge
or
that
which
gives
knowledge
gorgias
clearly
socrates
that
which
only
gives
belief
socrates
then
rhetoric
as
would
appear
is
the
artificer
of
a
persuasion
which
creates
belief
about
the
just
and
unjust
but
gives
no
instruction
about
them
gorgias
true
socrates
and
the
rhetorician
does
not
instruct
the
courts
of
law
or
other
assemblies
about
things
just
and
unjust
but
he
creates
belief
about
them
for
no
one
can
be
supposed
to
instruct
such
a
vast
multitude
about
such
high
matters
in
a
short
time
gorgias
certainly
not
socrates
come
then
and
let
us
see
what
we
really
mean
about
rhetoric
for
i
do
not
know
what
my
own
meaning
is
as
yet
when
the
assembly
meets
to
elect
a
physician
or
a
shipwright
or
any
other
craftsman
will
the
rhetorician
be
taken
into
counsel
surely
not
for
at
every
election
he
ought
to
be
chosen
who
is
most
skilled
and
again
when
walls
have
to
be
built
or
harbours
or
docks
to
be
constructed
not
the
rhetorician
but
the
master
workman
will
advise
or
when
generals
have
to
be
chosen
and
an
order
of
battle
arranged
or
a
position
taken
then
the
military
will
advise
and
not
the
rhetoricians
what
do
you
say
gorgias
since
you
profess
to
be
a
rhetorician
and
a
maker
of
rhetoricians
i
can
not
do
better
than
learn
the
nature
of
your
art
from
you
and
here
let
me
assure
you
that
i
have
your
interest
in
view
as
well
as
my
own
for
likely
enough
some
one
or
other
of
the
young
men
present
might
desire
to
become
your
pupil
and
in
fact
i
see
some
and
a
good
many
too
who
have
this
wish
but
they
would
be
too
modest
to
question
you
and
therefore
when
you
are
interrogated
by
me
i
would
have
you
imagine
that
you
are
interrogated
by
them
is
the
use
of
coming
to
you
gorgias
they
will
say
what
will
you
teach
us
to
advise
the
state
about
the
just
and
unjust
only
or
about
those
other
things
also
which
socrates
has
just
mentioned
how
will
you
answer
them
gorgias
i
like
your
way
of
leading
us
on
socrates
and
i
will
endeavour
to
reveal
to
you
the
whole
nature
of
rhetoric
you
must
have
heard
i
think
that
the
docks
and
the
walls
of
the
athenians
and
the
plan
of
the
harbour
were
devised
in
accordance
with
the
counsels
partly
of
themistocles
and
partly
of
pericles
and
not
at
the
suggestion
of
the
builders
socrates
such
is
the
tradition
gorgias
about
themistocles
and
i
myself
heard
the
speech
of
pericles
when
he
advised
us
about
the
middle
wall
gorgias
and
you
will
observe
socrates
that
when
a
decision
has
to
be
given
in
such
matters
the
rhetoricians
are
the
advisers
they
are
the
men
who
win
their
point
socrates
i
had
that
in
my
admiring
mind
gorgias
when
i
asked
what
is
the
nature
of
rhetoric
which
always
appears
to
me
when
i
look
at
the
matter
in
this
way
to
be
a
marvel
of
greatness
gorgias
a
marvel
indeed
socrates
if
you
only
knew
how
rhetoric
comprehends
and
holds
under
her
sway
all
the
inferior
arts
let
me
offer
you
a
striking
example
of
this
on
several
occasions
i
have
been
with
my
brother
herodicus
or
some
other
physician
to
see
one
of
his
patients
who
would
not
allow
the
physician
to
give
him
medicine
or
apply
the
knife
or
hot
iron
to
him
and
i
have
persuaded
him
to
do
for
me
what
he
would
not
do
for
the
physician
just
by
the
use
of
rhetoric
and
i
say
that
if
a
rhetorician
and
a
physician
were
to
go
to
any
city
and
had
there
to
argue
in
the
ecclesia
or
any
other
assembly
as
to
which
of
them
should
be
elected
the
physician
would
have
no
chance
but
he
who
could
speak
would
be
chosen
if
he
wished
and
in
a
contest
with
a
man
of
any
other
profession
the
rhetorician
more
than
any
one
would
have
the
power
of
getting
himself
chosen
for
he
can
speak
more
persuasively
to
the
multitude
than
any
of
them
and
on
any
subject
such
is
the
nature
and
power
of
the
art
of
rhetoric
and
yet
socrates
rhetoric
should
be
used
like
any
other
competitive
art
not
against
everybody
the
rhetorician
ought
not
to
abuse
his
strength
any
more
than
a
pugilist
or
pancratiast
or
other
master
of
fence
because
he
has
powers
which
are
more
than
a
match
either
for
friend
or
enemy
he
ought
not
therefore
to
strike
stab
or
slay
his
friends
suppose
a
man
to
have
been
trained
in
the
palestra
and
to
be
a
skilful
boxer
he
in
the
fulness
of
his
strength
goes
and
strikes
his
father
or
mother
or
one
of
his
familiars
or
friends
but
that
is
no
reason
why
the
trainers
or
should
be
held
in
detestation
or
banished
from
the
city
surely
not
for
they
taught
their
art
for
a
good
purpose
to
be
used
against
enemies
and
in
not
in
aggression
and
others
have
perverted
their
instructions
and
turned
to
a
bad
use
their
own
strength
and
skill
but
not
on
this
account
are
the
teachers
bad
neither
is
the
art
in
fault
or
bad
in
itself
i
should
rather
say
that
those
who
make
a
bad
use
of
the
art
are
to
blame
and
the
same
argument
holds
good
of
rhetoric
for
the
rhetorician
can
speak
against
all
men
and
upon
any
subject
in
short
he
can
persuade
the
multitude
better
than
any
other
man
of
anything
which
he
pleases
but
he
should
not
therefore
seek
to
defraud
the
physician
or
any
other
artist
of
his
reputation
merely
because
he
has
the
power
he
ought
to
use
rhetoric
fairly
as
he
would
also
use
his
athletic
powers
and
if
after
having
become
a
rhetorician
he
makes
a
bad
use
of
his
strength
and
skill
his
instructor
surely
ought
not
on
that
account
to
be
held
in
detestation
or
banished
for
he
was
intended
by
his
teacher
to
make
a
good
use
of
his
instructions
but
he
abuses
them
and
therefore
he
is
the
person
who
ought
to
be
held
in
detestation
banished
and
put
to
death
and
not
his
instructor
socrates
you
gorgias
like
myself
have
had
great
experience
of
disputations
and
you
must
have
observed
i
think
that
they
do
not
always
terminate
in
mutual
edification
or
in
the
definition
by
either
party
of
the
subjects
which
they
are
discussing
but
disagreements
are
apt
to
arise
somebody
says
that
another
has
not
spoken
truly
or
clearly
and
then
they
get
into
a
passion
and
begin
to
quarrel
both
parties
conceiving
that
their
opponents
are
arguing
from
personal
feeling
only
and
jealousy
of
themselves
not
from
any
interest
in
the
question
at
issue
and
sometimes
they
will
go
on
abusing
one
another
until
the
company
at
last
are
quite
vexed
at
themselves
for
ever
listening
to
such
fellows
why
do
i
say
this
why
because
i
can
not
help
feeling
that
you
are
now
saying
what
is
not
quite
consistent
or
accordant
with
what
you
were
saying
at
first
about
rhetoric
and
i
am
afraid
to
point
this
out
to
you
lest
you
should
think
that
i
have
some
animosity
against
you
and
that
i
speak
not
for
the
sake
of
discovering
the
truth
but
from
jealousy
of
you
now
if
you
are
one
of
my
sort
i
should
like
to
you
but
if
not
i
will
let
you
alone
and
what
is
my
sort
you
will
ask
i
am
one
of
those
who
are
very
willing
to
be
refuted
if
i
say
anything
which
is
not
true
and
very
willing
to
refute
any
one
else
who
says
what
is
not
true
and
quite
as
ready
to
be
refuted
as
to
refute
for
i
hold
that
this
is
the
greater
gain
of
the
two
just
as
the
gain
is
greater
of
being
cured
of
a
very
great
evil
than
of
curing
another
for
i
imagine
that
there
is
no
evil
which
a
man
can
endure
so
great
as
an
erroneous
opinion
about
the
matters
of
which
we
are
speaking
and
if
you
claim
to
be
one
of
my
sort
let
us
have
the
discussion
out
but
if
you
would
rather
have
done
no
matter
let
us
make
an
end
of
it
gorgias
i
should
say
socrates
that
i
am
quite
the
man
whom
you
indicate
but
perhaps
we
ought
to
consider
the
audience
for
before
you
came
i
had
already
given
a
long
exhibition
and
if
we
proceed
the
argument
may
run
on
to
a
great
length
and
therefore
i
think
that
we
should
consider
whether
we
may
not
be
detaining
some
part
of
the
company
when
they
are
wanting
to
do
something
else
chaerephon
you
hear
the
audience
cheering
gorgias
and
socrates
which
shows
their
desire
to
listen
to
you
and
for
myself
heaven
forbid
that
i
should
have
any
business
on
hand
which
would
take
me
away
from
a
discussion
so
interesting
and
so
ably
maintained
callicles
by
the
gods
chaerephon
although
i
have
been
present
at
many
discussions
i
doubt
whether
i
was
ever
so
much
delighted
before
and
therefore
if
you
go
on
discoursing
all
day
i
shall
be
the
better
pleased
socrates
i
may
truly
say
callicles
that
i
am
willing
if
gorgias
is
gorgias
after
all
this
socrates
i
should
be
disgraced
if
i
refused
especially
as
i
have
promised
to
answer
all
comers
in
accordance
with
the
wishes
of
the
company
then
do
you
begin
and
ask
of
me
any
question
which
you
like
socrates
let
me
tell
you
then
gorgias
what
surprises
me
in
your
words
though
i
dare
say
that
you
may
be
right
and
i
may
have
misunderstood
your
meaning
you
say
that
you
can
make
any
man
who
will
learn
of
you
a
rhetorician
gorgias
yes
socrates
do
you
mean
that
you
will
teach
him
to
gain
the
ears
of
the
multitude
on
any
subject
and
this
not
by
instruction
but
by
persuasion
gorgias
quite
so
socrates
you
were
saying
in
fact
that
the
rhetorician
will
have
greater
powers
of
persuasion
than
the
physician
even
in
a
matter
of
health
gorgias
yes
with
the
multitude
that
is
socrates
you
mean
to
say
with
the
ignorant
for
with
those
who
know
he
can
not
be
supposed
to
have
greater
powers
of
persuasion
gorgias
very
true
socrates
but
if
he
is
to
have
more
power
of
persuasion
than
the
physician
he
will
have
greater
power
than
he
who
knows
gorgias
certainly
socrates
although
he
is
not
a
physician
is
he
gorgias
no
socrates
and
he
who
is
not
a
physician
must
obviously
be
ignorant
of
what
the
physician
knows
gorgias
clearly
socrates
then
when
the
rhetorician
is
more
persuasive
than
the
physician
the
ignorant
is
more
persuasive
with
the
ignorant
than
he
who
has
knowledge
is
not
that
the
inference
gorgias
in
the
case
supposed
yes
socrates
and
the
same
holds
of
the
relation
of
rhetoric
to
all
the
other
arts
the
rhetorician
need
not
know
the
truth
about
things
he
has
only
to
discover
some
way
of
persuading
the
ignorant
that
he
has
more
knowledge
than
those
who
know
gorgias
yes
socrates
and
is
not
this
a
great
comfort
not
to
have
learned
the
other
arts
but
the
art
of
rhetoric
only
and
yet
to
be
in
no
way
inferior
to
the
professors
of
them
socrates
whether
the
rhetorician
is
or
not
inferior
on
this
account
is
a
question
which
we
will
hereafter
examine
if
the
enquiry
is
likely
to
be
of
any
service
to
us
but
i
would
rather
begin
by
asking
whether
he
is
or
is
not
as
ignorant
of
the
just
and
unjust
base
and
honourable
good
and
evil
as
he
is
of
medicine
and
the
other
arts
i
mean
to
say
does
he
really
know
anything
of
what
is
good
and
evil
base
or
honourable
just
or
unjust
in
them
or
has
he
only
a
way
with
the
ignorant
of
persuading
them
that
he
not
knowing
is
to
be
esteemed
to
know
more
about
these
things
than
some
one
else
who
knows
or
must
the
pupil
know
these
things
and
come
to
you
knowing
them
before
he
can
acquire
the
art
of
rhetoric
if
he
is
ignorant
you
who
are
the
teacher
of
rhetoric
will
not
teach
him
it
is
not
your
business
but
you
will
make
him
seem
to
the
multitude
to
know
them
when
he
does
not
know
them
and
seem
to
be
a
good
man
when
he
is
not
or
will
you
be
unable
to
teach
him
rhetoric
at
all
unless
he
knows
the
truth
of
these
things
first
what
is
to
be
said
about
all
this
by
heavens
gorgias
i
wish
that
you
would
reveal
to
me
the
power
of
rhetoric
as
you
were
saying
that
you
would
gorgias
well
socrates
i
suppose
that
if
the
pupil
does
chance
not
to
know
them
he
will
have
to
learn
of
me
these
things
as
well
socrates
say
no
more
for
there
you
are
right
and
so
he
whom
you
make
a
rhetorician
must
either
know
the
nature
of
the
just
and
unjust
already
or
he
must
be
taught
by
you
gorgias
certainly
socrates
well
and
is
not
he
who
has
learned
carpentering
a
carpenter
gorgias
yes
socrates
and
he
who
has
learned
music
a
musician
gorgias
yes
socrates
and
he
who
has
learned
medicine
is
a
physician
in
like
manner
he
who
has
learned
anything
whatever
is
that
which
his
knowledge
makes
him
gorgias
certainly
socrates
and
in
the
same
way
he
who
has
learned
what
is
just
is
just
gorgias
to
be
sure
socrates
and
he
who
is
just
may
be
supposed
to
do
what
is
just
gorgias
yes
socrates
and
must
not
the
just
man
always
desire
to
do
what
is
just
gorgias
that
is
clearly
the
inference
socrates
surely
then
the
just
man
will
never
consent
to
do
injustice
gorgias
certainly
not
socrates
and
according
to
the
argument
the
rhetorician
must
be
a
just
man
gorgias
yes
socrates
and
will
therefore
never
be
willing
to
do
injustice
gorgias
clearly
not
socrates
but
do
you
remember
saying
just
now
that
the
trainer
is
not
to
be
accused
or
banished
if
the
pugilist
makes
a
wrong
use
of
his
pugilistic
art
and
in
like
manner
if
the
rhetorician
makes
a
bad
and
unjust
use
of
his
rhetoric
that
is
not
to
be
laid
to
the
charge
of
his
teacher
who
is
not
to
be
banished
but
the
himself
who
made
a
bad
use
of
his
rhetoric
he
is
to
be
banished
was
not
that
said
gorgias
yes
it
was
socrates
but
now
we
are
affirming
that
the
aforesaid
rhetorician
will
never
have
done
injustice
at
all
gorgias
true
socrates
and
at
the
very
outset
gorgias
it
was
said
that
rhetoric
treated
of
discourse
not
like
arithmetic
about
odd
and
even
but
about
just
and
unjust
was
not
this
said
gorgias
yes
socrates
i
was
thinking
at
the
time
when
i
heard
you
saying
so
that
rhetoric
which
is
always
discoursing
about
justice
could
not
possibly
be
an
unjust
thing
but
when
you
added
shortly
afterwards
that
the
rhetorician
might
make
a
bad
use
of
rhetoric
i
noted
with
surprise
the
inconsistency
into
which
you
had
fallen
and
i
said
that
if
you
thought
as
i
did
that
there
was
a
gain
in
being
refuted
there
would
be
an
advantage
in
going
on
with
the
question
but
if
not
i
would
leave
off
and
in
the
course
of
our
investigations
as
you
will
see
yourself
the
rhetorician
has
been
acknowledged
to
be
incapable
of
making
an
unjust
use
of
rhetoric
or
of
willingness
to
do
injustice
by
the
dog
gorgias
there
will
be
a
great
deal
of
discussion
before
we
get
at
the
truth
of
all
this
polus
and
do
even
you
socrates
seriously
believe
what
you
are
now
saying
about
rhetoric
what
because
gorgias
was
ashamed
to
deny
that
the
rhetorician
knew
the
just
and
the
honourable
and
the
good
and
admitted
that
to
any
one
who
came
to
him
ignorant
of
them
he
could
teach
them
and
then
out
of
this
admission
there
arose
a
contradiction
the
thing
which
you
dearly
love
and
to
which
not
he
but
you
brought
the
argument
by
your
captious
questions
do
you
seriously
believe
that
there
is
any
truth
in
all
this
for
will
any
one
ever
acknowledge
that
he
does
not
know
or
can
not
teach
the
nature
of
justice
the
truth
is
that
there
is
great
want
of
manners
in
bringing
the
argument
to
such
a
pass
socrates
illustrious
polus
the
reason
why
we
provide
ourselves
with
friends
and
children
is
that
when
we
get
old
and
stumble
a
younger
generation
may
be
at
hand
to
set
us
on
our
legs
again
in
our
words
and
in
our
actions
and
now
if
i
and
gorgias
are
stumbling
here
are
you
who
should
raise
us
up
and
i
for
my
part
engage
to
retract
any
error
into
which
you
may
think
that
i
have
one
condition
polus
what
condition
socrates
that
you
contract
polus
the
prolixity
of
speech
in
which
you
indulged
at
first
polus
what
do
you
mean
that
i
may
not
use
as
many
words
as
i
please
socrates
only
to
think
my
friend
that
having
come
on
a
visit
to
athens
which
is
the
most
state
in
hellas
you
when
you
got
there
and
you
alone
should
be
deprived
of
the
power
of
speech
that
would
be
hard
indeed
but
then
consider
my
case
shall
not
i
be
very
hardly
used
if
when
you
are
making
a
long
oration
and
refusing
to
answer
what
you
are
asked
i
am
compelled
to
stay
and
listen
to
you
and
may
not
go
away
i
say
rather
if
you
have
a
real
interest
in
the
argument
or
to
repeat
my
former
expression
have
any
desire
to
set
it
on
its
legs
take
back
any
statement
which
you
please
and
in
your
turn
ask
and
answer
like
myself
and
gorgias
refute
and
be
refuted
for
i
suppose
that
you
would
claim
to
know
what
gorgias
knows
would
you
not
polus
yes
socrates
and
you
like
him
invite
any
one
to
ask
you
about
anything
which
he
pleases
and
you
will
know
how
to
answer
him
polus
to
be
sure
socrates
and
now
which
will
you
do
ask
or
answer
polus
i
will
ask
and
do
you
answer
me
socrates
the
same
question
which
gorgias
as
you
suppose
is
unable
to
answer
what
is
rhetoric
socrates
do
you
mean
what
sort
of
an
art
polus
yes
socrates
to
say
the
truth
polus
it
is
not
an
art
at
all
in
my
opinion
polus
then
what
in
your
opinion
is
rhetoric
socrates
a
thing
which
as
i
was
lately
reading
in
a
book
of
yours
you
say
that
you
have
made
an
art
polus
what
thing
socrates
i
should
say
a
sort
of
experience
polus
does
rhetoric
seem
to
you
to
be
an
experience
socrates
that
is
my
view
but
you
may
be
of
another
mind
polus
an
experience
in
what
socrates
an
experience
in
producing
a
sort
of
delight
and
gratification
polus
and
if
able
to
gratify
others
must
not
rhetoric
be
a
fine
thing
socrates
what
are
you
saying
polus
why
do
you
ask
me
whether
rhetoric
is
a
fine
thing
or
not
when
i
have
not
as
yet
told
you
what
rhetoric
is
polus
did
i
not
hear
you
say
that
rhetoric
was
a
sort
of
experience
socrates
will
you
who
are
so
desirous
to
gratify
others
afford
a
slight
gratification
to
me
polus
i
will
socrates
will
you
ask
me
what
sort
of
an
art
is
cookery
polus
what
sort
of
an
art
is
cookery
socrates
not
an
art
at
all
polus
polus
what
then
socrates
i
should
say
an
experience
polus
in
what
i
wish
that
you
would
explain
to
me
socrates
an
experience
in
producing
a
sort
of
delight
and
gratification
polus
polus
then
are
cookery
and
rhetoric
the
same
socrates
no
they
are
only
different
parts
of
the
same
profession
polus
of
what
profession
socrates
i
am
afraid
that
the
truth
may
seem
discourteous
and
i
hesitate
to
answer
lest
gorgias
should
imagine
that
i
am
making
fun
of
his
own
profession
for
whether
or
no
this
is
that
art
of
rhetoric
which
gorgias
practises
i
really
can
not
tell
from
what
he
was
just
now
saying
nothing
appeared
of
what
he
thought
of
his
art
but
the
rhetoric
which
i
mean
is
a
part
of
a
not
very
creditable
whole
gorgias
a
part
of
what
socrates
say
what
you
mean
and
never
mind
me
socrates
in
my
opinion
then
gorgias
the
whole
of
which
rhetoric
is
a
part
is
not
an
art
at
all
but
the
habit
of
a
bold
and
ready
wit
which
knows
how
to
manage
mankind
this
habit
i
sum
up
under
the
word
and
it
appears
to
me
to
have
many
other
parts
one
of
which
is
cookery
which
may
seem
to
be
an
art
but
as
i
maintain
is
only
an
experience
or
routine
and
not
an
art
another
part
is
rhetoric
and
the
art
of
attiring
and
sophistry
are
two
others
thus
there
are
four
branches
and
four
different
things
answering
to
them
and
polus
may
ask
if
he
likes
for
he
has
not
as
yet
been
informed
what
part
of
flattery
is
rhetoric
he
did
not
see
that
i
had
not
yet
answered
him
when
he
proceeded
to
ask
a
further
question
whether
i
do
not
think
rhetoric
a
fine
thing
but
i
shall
not
tell
him
whether
rhetoric
is
a
fine
thing
or
not
until
i
have
first
answered
is
rhetoric
for
that
would
not
be
right
polus
but
i
shall
be
happy
to
answer
if
you
will
ask
me
what
part
of
flattery
is
rhetoric
polus
i
will
ask
and
do
you
answer
what
part
of
flattery
is
rhetoric
socrates
will
you
understand
my
answer
rhetoric
according
to
my
view
is
the
ghost
or
counterfeit
of
a
part
of
politics
polus
and
noble
or
ignoble
socrates
ignoble
i
should
say
if
i
am
compelled
to
answer
for
i
call
what
is
bad
ignoble
though
i
doubt
whether
you
understand
what
i
was
saying
before
gorgias
indeed
socrates
i
can
not
say
that
i
understand
myself
socrates
i
do
not
wonder
gorgias
for
i
have
not
as
yet
explained
myself
and
our
friend
polus
colt
by
name
and
colt
by
nature
is
apt
to
run
away
this
is
an
untranslatable
play
on
the
name
which
means
colt
gorgias
never
mind
him
but
explain
to
me
what
you
mean
by
saying
that
rhetoric
is
the
counterfeit
of
a
part
of
politics
socrates
i
will
try
then
to
explain
my
notion
of
rhetoric
and
if
i
am
mistaken
my
friend
polus
shall
refute
me
we
may
assume
the
existence
of
bodies
and
of
souls
gorgias
of
course
socrates
you
would
further
admit
that
there
is
a
good
condition
of
either
of
them
gorgias
yes
socrates
which
condition
may
not
be
really
good
but
good
only
in
appearance
i
mean
to
say
that
there
are
many
persons
who
appear
to
be
in
good
health
and
whom
only
a
physician
or
trainer
will
discern
at
first
sight
not
to
be
in
good
health
gorgias
true
socrates
and
this
applies
not
only
to
the
body
but
also
to
the
soul
in
either
there
may
be
that
which
gives
the
appearance
of
health
and
not
the
reality
gorgias
yes
certainly
socrates
and
now
i
will
endeavour
to
explain
to
you
more
clearly
what
i
mean
the
soul
and
body
being
two
have
two
arts
corresponding
to
them
there
is
the
art
of
politics
attending
on
the
soul
and
another
art
attending
on
the
body
of
which
i
know
no
single
name
but
which
may
be
described
as
having
two
divisions
one
of
them
gymnastic
and
the
other
medicine
and
in
politics
there
is
a
legislative
part
which
answers
to
gymnastic
as
justice
does
to
medicine
and
the
two
parts
run
into
one
another
justice
having
to
do
with
the
same
subject
as
legislation
and
medicine
with
the
same
subject
as
gymnastic
but
with
a
difference
now
seeing
that
there
are
these
four
arts
two
attending
on
the
body
and
two
on
the
soul
for
their
highest
good
flattery
knowing
or
rather
guessing
their
natures
has
distributed
herself
into
four
shams
or
simulations
of
them
she
puts
on
the
likeness
of
some
one
or
other
of
them
and
pretends
to
be
that
which
she
simulates
and
having
no
regard
for
highest
interests
is
ever
making
pleasure
the
bait
of
the
unwary
and
deceiving
them
into
the
belief
that
she
is
of
the
highest
value
to
them
cookery
simulates
the
disguise
of
medicine
and
pretends
to
know
what
food
is
the
best
for
the
body
and
if
the
physician
and
the
cook
had
to
enter
into
a
competition
in
which
children
were
the
judges
or
men
who
had
no
more
sense
than
children
as
to
which
of
them
best
understands
the
goodness
or
badness
of
food
the
physician
would
be
starved
to
death
a
flattery
i
deem
this
to
be
and
of
an
ignoble
sort
polus
for
to
you
i
am
now
addressing
myself
because
it
aims
at
pleasure
without
any
thought
of
the
best
an
art
i
do
not
call
it
but
only
an
experience
because
it
is
unable
to
explain
or
to
give
a
reason
of
the
nature
of
its
own
applications
and
i
do
not
call
any
irrational
thing
an
art
but
if
you
dispute
my
words
i
am
prepared
to
argue
in
defence
of
them
cookery
then
i
maintain
to
be
a
flattery
which
takes
the
form
of
medicine
and
tiring
in
like
manner
is
a
flattery
which
takes
the
form
of
gymnastic
and
is
knavish
false
ignoble
illiberal
working
deceitfully
by
the
help
of
lines
and
colours
and
enamels
and
garments
and
making
men
affect
a
spurious
beauty
to
the
neglect
of
the
true
beauty
which
is
given
by
gymnastic
i
would
rather
not
be
tedious
and
therefore
i
will
only
say
after
the
manner
of
the
geometricians
for
i
think
that
by
this
time
you
will
be
able
to
follow
as
tiring
gymnastic
cookery
medicine
or
rather
as
tiring
gymnastic
sophistry
legislation
and
as
cookery
medicine
rhetoric
justice
and
this
i
say
is
the
natural
difference
between
the
rhetorician
and
the
sophist
but
by
reason
of
their
near
connection
they
are
apt
to
be
jumbled
up
together
neither
do
they
know
what
to
make
of
themselves
nor
do
other
men
know
what
to
make
of
them
for
if
the
body
presided
over
itself
and
were
not
under
the
guidance
of
the
soul
and
the
soul
did
not
discern
and
discriminate
between
cookery
and
medicine
but
the
body
was
made
the
judge
of
them
and
the
rule
of
judgment
was
the
bodily
delight
which
was
given
by
them
then
the
word
of
anaxagoras
that
word
with
which
you
friend
polus
are
so
well
acquainted
would
prevail
far
and
wide
would
come
again
and
cookery
health
and
medicine
would
mingle
in
an
indiscriminate
mass
and
now
i
have
told
you
my
notion
of
rhetoric
which
is
in
relation
to
the
soul
what
cookery
is
to
the
body
i
may
have
been
inconsistent
in
making
a
long
speech
when
i
would
not
allow
you
to
discourse
at
length
but
i
think
that
i
may
be
excused
because
you
did
not
understand
me
and
could
make
no
use
of
my
answer
when
i
spoke
shortly
and
therefore
i
had
to
enter
into
an
explanation
and
if
i
show
an
equal
inability
to
make
use
of
yours
i
hope
that
you
will
speak
at
equal
length
but
if
i
am
able
to
understand
you
let
me
have
the
benefit
of
your
brevity
as
is
only
fair
and
now
you
may
do
what
you
please
with
my
answer
polus
what
do
you
mean
do
you
think
that
rhetoric
is
flattery
socrates
nay
i
said
a
part
of
flattery
if
at
your
age
polus
you
can
not
remember
what
will
you
do
when
you
get
older
polus
and
are
the
good
rhetoricians
meanly
regarded
in
states
under
the
idea
that
they
are
flatterers
socrates
is
that
a
question
or
the
beginning
of
a
speech
polus
i
am
asking
a
question
socrates
then
my
answer
is
that
they
are
not
regarded
at
all
polus
how
not
regarded
have
they
not
very
great
power
in
states
socrates
not
if
you
mean
to
say
that
power
is
a
good
to
the
possessor
polus
and
that
is
what
i
do
mean
to
say
socrates
then
if
so
i
think
that
they
have
the
least
power
of
all
the
citizens
polus
what
are
they
not
like
tyrants
they
kill
and
despoil
and
exile
any
one
whom
they
please
socrates
by
the
dog
polus
i
can
not
make
out
at
each
deliverance
of
yours
whether
you
are
giving
an
opinion
of
your
own
or
asking
a
question
of
me
polus
i
am
asking
a
question
of
you
socrates
yes
my
friend
but
you
ask
two
questions
at
once
polus
how
two
questions
socrates
why
did
you
not
say
just
now
that
the
rhetoricians
are
like
tyrants
and
that
they
kill
and
despoil
or
exile
any
one
whom
they
please
polus
i
did
socrates
well
then
i
say
to
you
that
here
are
two
questions
in
one
and
i
will
answer
both
of
them
and
i
tell
you
polus
that
rhetoricians
and
tyrants
have
the
least
possible
power
in
states
as
i
was
just
now
saying
for
they
do
literally
nothing
which
they
will
but
only
what
they
think
best
polus
and
is
not
that
a
great
power
socrates
polus
has
already
said
the
reverse
polus
said
the
reverse
nay
that
is
what
i
assert
socrates
no
by
the
great
what
do
you
call
him
not
you
for
you
say
that
power
is
a
good
to
him
who
has
the
power
polus
i
do
socrates
and
would
you
maintain
that
if
a
fool
does
what
he
thinks
best
this
is
a
good
and
would
you
call
this
great
power
polus
i
should
not
socrates
then
you
must
prove
that
the
rhetorician
is
not
a
fool
and
that
rhetoric
is
an
art
and
not
a
flattery
and
so
you
will
have
refuted
me
but
if
you
leave
me
unrefuted
why
the
rhetoricians
who
do
what
they
think
best
in
states
and
the
tyrants
will
have
nothing
upon
which
to
congratulate
themselves
if
as
you
say
power
be
indeed
a
good
admitting
at
the
same
time
that
what
is
done
without
sense
is
an
evil
polus
yes
i
admit
that
socrates
how
then
can
the
rhetoricians
or
the
tyrants
have
great
power
in
states
unless
polus
can
refute
socrates
and
prove
to
him
that
they
do
as
they
will
polus
this
fellow
socrates
i
say
that
they
do
not
do
as
they
will
now
refute
me
polus
why
have
you
not
already
said
that
they
do
as
they
think
best
socrates
and
i
say
so
still
polus
then
surely
they
do
as
they
will
socrates
i
deny
it
polus
but
they
do
what
they
think
best
socrates
aye
polus
that
socrates
is
monstrous
and
absurd
socrates
good
words
good
polus
as
i
may
say
in
your
own
peculiar
style
but
if
you
have
any
questions
to
ask
of
me
either
prove
that
i
am
in
error
or
give
the
answer
yourself
polus
very
well
i
am
willing
to
answer
that
i
may
know
what
you
mean
socrates
do
men
appear
to
you
to
will
that
which
they
do
or
to
will
that
further
end
for
the
sake
of
which
they
do
a
thing
when
they
take
medicine
for
example
at
the
bidding
of
a
physician
do
they
will
the
drinking
of
the
medicine
which
is
painful
or
the
health
for
the
sake
of
which
they
drink
polus
clearly
the
health
socrates
and
when
men
go
on
a
voyage
or
engage
in
business
they
do
not
will
that
which
they
are
doing
at
the
time
for
who
would
desire
to
take
the
risk
of
a
voyage
or
the
trouble
of
business
but
they
will
to
have
the
wealth
for
the
sake
of
which
they
go
on
a
voyage
polus
certainly
socrates
and
is
not
this
universally
true
if
a
man
does
something
for
the
sake
of
something
else
he
wills
not
that
which
he
does
but
that
for
the
sake
of
which
he
does
it
polus
yes
socrates
and
are
not
all
things
either
good
or
evil
or
intermediate
and
indifferent
polus
to
be
sure
socrates
socrates
wisdom
and
health
and
wealth
and
the
like
you
would
call
goods
and
their
opposites
evils
polus
i
should
socrates
and
the
things
which
are
neither
good
nor
evil
and
which
partake
sometimes
of
the
nature
of
good
and
at
other
times
of
evil
or
of
neither
are
such
as
sitting
walking
running
sailing
or
again
wood
stones
and
the
like
these
are
the
things
which
you
call
neither
good
nor
evil
polus
exactly
so
socrates
are
these
indifferent
things
done
for
the
sake
of
the
good
or
the
good
for
the
sake
of
the
indifferent
polus
clearly
the
indifferent
for
the
sake
of
the
good
socrates
when
we
walk
we
walk
for
the
sake
of
the
good
and
under
the
idea
that
it
is
better
to
walk
and
when
we
stand
we
stand
equally
for
the
sake
of
the
good
polus
yes
socrates
and
when
we
kill
a
man
we
kill
him
or
exile
him
or
despoil
him
of
his
goods
because
as
we
think
it
will
conduce
to
our
good
polus
certainly
socrates
men
who
do
any
of
these
things
do
them
for
the
sake
of
the
good
polus
yes
socrates
and
did
we
not
admit
that
in
doing
something
for
the
sake
of
something
else
we
do
not
will
those
things
which
we
do
but
that
other
thing
for
the
sake
of
which
we
do
them
polus
most
true
socrates
then
we
do
not
will
simply
to
kill
a
man
or
to
exile
him
or
to
despoil
him
of
his
goods
but
we
will
to
do
that
which
conduces
to
our
good
and
if
the
act
is
not
conducive
to
our
good
we
do
not
will
it
for
we
will
as
you
say
that
which
is
our
good
but
that
which
is
neither
good
nor
evil
or
simply
evil
we
do
not
will
why
are
you
silent
polus
am
i
not
right
polus
you
are
right
socrates
hence
we
may
infer
that
if
any
one
whether
he
be
a
tyrant
or
a
rhetorician
kills
another
or
exiles
another
or
deprives
him
of
his
property
under
the
idea
that
the
act
is
for
his
own
interests
when
really
not
for
his
own
interests
he
may
be
said
to
do
what
seems
best
to
him
polus
yes
socrates
but
does
he
do
what
he
wills
if
he
does
what
is
evil
why
do
you
not
answer
polus
well
i
suppose
not
socrates
then
if
great
power
is
a
good
as
you
allow
will
such
a
one
have
great
power
in
a
state
polus
he
will
not
socrates
then
i
was
right
in
saying
that
a
man
may
do
what
seems
good
to
him
in
a
state
and
not
have
great
power
and
not
do
what
he
wills
polus
as
though
you
socrates
would
not
like
to
have
the
power
of
doing
what
seemed
good
to
you
in
the
state
rather
than
not
you
would
not
be
jealous
when
you
saw
any
one
killing
or
despoiling
or
imprisoning
whom
he
pleased
oh
no
socrates
justly
or
unjustly
do
you
mean
polus
in
either
case
is
he
not
equally
to
be
envied
socrates
forbear
polus
polus
why
socrates
because
you
ought
not
to
envy
wretches
who
are
not
to
be
envied
but
only
to
pity
them
polus
and
are
those
of
whom
i
spoke
wretches
socrates
yes
certainly
they
are
polus
and
so
you
think
that
he
who
slays
any
one
whom
he
pleases
and
justly
slays
him
is
pitiable
and
wretched
socrates
no
i
do
not
say
that
of
him
but
neither
do
i
think
that
he
is
to
be
envied
polus
were
you
not
saying
just
now
that
he
is
wretched
socrates
yes
my
friend
if
he
killed
another
unjustly
in
which
case
he
is
also
to
be
pitied
and
he
is
not
to
be
envied
if
he
killed
him
justly
polus
at
any
rate
you
will
allow
that
he
who
is
unjustly
put
to
death
is
wretched
and
to
be
pitied
socrates
not
so
much
polus
as
he
who
kills
him
and
not
so
much
as
he
who
is
justly
killed
polus
how
can
that
be
socrates
socrates
that
may
very
well
be
inasmuch
as
doing
injustice
is
the
greatest
of
evils
polus
but
is
it
the
greatest
is
not
suffering
injustice
a
greater
evil
socrates
certainly
not
polus
then
would
you
rather
suffer
than
do
injustice
socrates
i
should
not
like
either
but
if
i
must
choose
between
them
i
would
rather
suffer
than
do
polus
then
you
would
not
wish
to
be
a
tyrant
socrates
not
if
you
mean
by
tyranny
what
i
mean
polus
i
mean
as
i
said
before
the
power
of
doing
whatever
seems
good
to
you
in
a
state
killing
banishing
doing
in
all
things
as
you
like
socrates
well
then
illustrious
friend
when
i
have
said
my
say
do
you
reply
to
me
suppose
that
i
go
into
a
crowded
agora
and
take
a
dagger
under
my
arm
polus
i
say
to
you
i
have
just
acquired
rare
power
and
become
a
tyrant
for
if
i
think
that
any
of
these
men
whom
you
see
ought
to
be
put
to
death
the
man
whom
i
have
a
mind
to
kill
is
as
good
as
dead
and
if
i
am
disposed
to
break
his
head
or
tear
his
garment
he
will
have
his
head
broken
or
his
garment
torn
in
an
instant
such
is
my
great
power
in
this
city
and
if
you
do
not
believe
me
and
i
show
you
the
dagger
you
would
probably
reply
socrates
in
that
sort
of
way
any
one
may
have
great
power
he
may
burn
any
house
which
he
pleases
and
the
docks
and
triremes
of
the
athenians
and
all
their
other
vessels
whether
public
or
private
but
can
you
believe
that
this
mere
doing
as
you
think
best
is
great
power
polus
certainly
not
such
doing
as
this
socrates
but
can
you
tell
me
why
you
disapprove
of
such
a
power
polus
i
can
socrates
why
then
polus
why
because
he
who
did
as
you
say
would
be
certain
to
be
punished
socrates
and
punishment
is
an
evil
polus
certainly
socrates
and
you
would
admit
once
more
my
good
sir
that
great
power
is
a
benefit
to
a
man
if
his
actions
turn
out
to
his
advantage
and
that
this
is
the
meaning
of
great
power
and
if
not
then
his
power
is
an
evil
and
is
no
power
but
let
us
look
at
the
matter
in
another
way
do
we
not
acknowledge
that
the
things
of
which
we
were
speaking
the
infliction
of
death
and
exile
and
the
deprivation
of
property
are
sometimes
a
good
and
sometimes
not
a
good
polus
certainly
socrates
about
that
you
and
i
may
be
supposed
to
agree
polus
yes
socrates
tell
me
then
when
do
you
say
that
they
are
good
and
when
that
they
are
evil
what
principle
do
you
lay
down
polus
i
would
rather
socrates
that
you
should
answer
as
well
as
ask
that
question
socrates
well
polus
since
you
would
rather
have
the
answer
from
me
i
say
that
they
are
good
when
they
are
just
and
evil
when
they
are
unjust
polus
you
are
hard
of
refutation
socrates
but
might
not
a
child
refute
that
statement
socrates
then
i
shall
be
very
grateful
to
the
child
and
equally
grateful
to
you
if
you
will
refute
me
and
deliver
me
from
my
foolishness
and
i
hope
that
refute
me
you
will
and
not
weary
of
doing
good
to
a
friend
polus
yes
socrates
and
i
need
not
go
far
or
appeal
to
antiquity
events
which
happened
only
a
few
days
ago
are
enough
to
refute
you
and
to
prove
that
many
men
who
do
wrong
are
happy
socrates
what
events
polus
you
see
i
presume
that
archelaus
the
son
of
perdiccas
is
now
the
ruler
of
macedonia
socrates
at
any
rate
i
hear
that
he
is
polus
and
do
you
think
that
he
is
happy
or
miserable
socrates
i
can
not
say
polus
for
i
have
never
had
any
acquaintance
with
him
polus
and
can
not
you
tell
at
once
and
without
having
an
acquaintance
with
him
whether
a
man
is
happy
socrates
most
certainly
not
polus
then
clearly
socrates
you
would
say
that
you
did
not
even
know
whether
the
great
king
was
a
happy
man
socrates
and
i
should
speak
the
truth
for
i
do
not
know
how
he
stands
in
the
matter
of
education
and
justice
polus
what
and
does
all
happiness
consist
in
this
socrates
yes
indeed
polus
that
is
my
doctrine
the
men
and
women
who
are
gentle
and
good
are
also
happy
as
i
maintain
and
the
unjust
and
evil
are
miserable
polus
then
according
to
your
doctrine
the
said
archelaus
is
miserable
socrates
yes
my
friend
if
he
is
wicked
polus
that
he
is
wicked
i
can
not
deny
for
he
had
no
title
at
all
to
the
throne
which
he
now
occupies
he
being
only
the
son
of
a
woman
who
was
the
slave
of
alcetas
the
brother
of
perdiccas
he
himself
therefore
in
strict
right
was
the
slave
of
alcetas
and
if
he
had
meant
to
do
rightly
he
would
have
remained
his
slave
and
then
according
to
your
doctrine
he
would
have
been
happy
but
now
he
is
unspeakably
miserable
for
he
has
been
guilty
of
the
greatest
crimes
in
the
first
place
he
invited
his
uncle
and
master
alcetas
to
come
to
him
under
the
pretence
that
he
would
restore
to
him
the
throne
which
perdiccas
has
usurped
and
after
entertaining
him
and
his
son
alexander
who
was
his
own
cousin
and
nearly
of
an
age
with
him
and
making
them
drunk
he
threw
them
into
a
waggon
and
carried
them
off
by
night
and
slew
them
and
got
both
of
them
out
of
the
way
and
when
he
had
done
all
this
wickedness
he
never
discovered
that
he
was
the
most
miserable
of
all
men
and
was
very
far
from
repenting
shall
i
tell
you
how
he
showed
his
remorse
he
had
a
younger
brother
a
child
of
seven
years
old
who
was
the
legitimate
son
of
perdiccas
and
to
him
of
right
the
kingdom
belonged
archelaus
however
had
no
mind
to
bring
him
up
as
he
ought
and
restore
the
kingdom
to
him
that
was
not
his
notion
of
happiness
but
not
long
afterwards
he
threw
him
into
a
well
and
drowned
him
and
declared
to
his
mother
cleopatra
that
he
had
fallen
in
while
running
after
a
goose
and
had
been
killed
and
now
as
he
is
the
greatest
criminal
of
all
the
macedonians
he
may
be
supposed
to
be
the
most
miserable
and
not
the
happiest
of
them
and
i
dare
say
that
there
are
many
athenians
and
you
would
be
at
the
head
of
them
who
would
rather
be
any
other
macedonian
than
archelaus
socrates
i
praised
you
at
first
polus
for
being
a
rhetorician
rather
than
a
reasoner
and
this
as
i
suppose
is
the
sort
of
argument
with
which
you
fancy
that
a
child
might
refute
me
and
by
which
i
stand
refuted
when
i
say
that
the
unjust
man
is
not
happy
but
my
good
friend
where
is
the
refutation
i
can
not
admit
a
word
which
you
have
been
saying
polus
that
is
because
you
will
not
for
you
surely
must
think
as
i
do
socrates
not
so
my
simple
friend
but
because
you
will
refute
me
after
the
manner
which
rhetoricians
practise
in
courts
of
law
for
there
the
one
party
think
that
they
refute
the
other
when
they
bring
forward
a
number
of
witnesses
of
good
repute
in
proof
of
their
allegations
and
their
adversary
has
only
a
single
one
or
none
at
all
but
this
kind
of
proof
is
of
no
value
where
truth
is
the
aim
a
man
may
often
be
sworn
down
by
a
multitude
of
false
witnesses
who
have
a
great
air
of
respectability
and
in
this
argument
nearly
every
one
athenian
and
stranger
alike
would
be
on
your
side
if
you
should
bring
witnesses
in
disproof
of
my
statement
you
may
if
you
will
summon
nicias
the
son
of
niceratus
and
let
his
brothers
who
gave
the
row
of
tripods
which
stand
in
the
precincts
of
dionysus
come
with
him
or
you
may
summon
aristocrates
the
son
of
scellius
who
is
the
giver
of
that
famous
offering
which
is
at
delphi
summon
if
you
will
the
whole
house
of
pericles
or
any
other
great
athenian
family
whom
you
choose
they
will
all
agree
with
you
i
only
am
left
alone
and
can
not
agree
for
you
do
not
convince
me
although
you
produce
many
false
witnesses
against
me
in
the
hope
of
depriving
me
of
my
inheritance
which
is
the
truth
but
i
consider
that
nothing
worth
speaking
of
will
have
been
effected
by
me
unless
i
make
you
the
one
witness
of
my
words
nor
by
you
unless
you
make
me
the
one
witness
of
yours
no
matter
about
the
rest
of
the
world
for
there
are
two
ways
of
refutation
one
which
is
yours
and
that
of
the
world
in
general
but
mine
is
of
another
sort
let
us
compare
them
and
see
in
what
they
differ
for
indeed
we
are
at
issue
about
matters
which
to
know
is
honourable
and
not
to
know
disgraceful
to
know
or
not
to
know
happiness
and
misery
that
is
the
chief
of
them
and
what
knowledge
can
be
nobler
or
what
ignorance
more
disgraceful
than
this
and
therefore
i
will
begin
by
asking
you
whether
you
do
not
think
that
a
man
who
is
unjust
and
doing
injustice
can
be
happy
seeing
that
you
think
archelaus
unjust
and
yet
happy
may
i
assume
this
to
be
your
opinion
polus
certainly
socrates
but
i
say
that
this
is
an
impossibility
here
is
one
point
about
which
we
are
at
issue
very
good
and
do
you
mean
to
say
also
that
if
he
meets
with
retribution
and
punishment
he
will
still
be
happy
polus
certainly
not
in
that
case
he
will
be
most
miserable
socrates
on
the
other
hand
if
the
unjust
be
not
punished
then
according
to
you
he
will
be
happy
polus
yes
socrates
but
in
my
opinion
polus
the
unjust
or
doer
of
unjust
actions
is
miserable
in
any
case
more
miserable
however
if
he
be
not
punished
and
does
not
meet
with
retribution
and
less
miserable
if
he
be
punished
and
meets
with
retribution
at
the
hands
of
gods
and
men
polus
you
are
maintaining
a
strange
doctrine
socrates
socrates
i
shall
try
to
make
you
agree
with
me
o
my
friend
for
as
a
friend
i
regard
you
then
these
are
the
points
at
issue
between
us
are
they
not
i
was
saying
that
to
do
is
worse
than
to
suffer
injustice
polus
exactly
so
socrates
and
you
said
the
opposite
polus
yes
socrates
i
said
also
that
the
wicked
are
miserable
and
you
refuted
me
polus
by
zeus
i
did
socrates
in
your
own
opinion
polus
polus
yes
and
i
rather
suspect
that
i
was
in
the
right
socrates
you
further
said
that
the
is
happy
if
he
be
unpunished
polus
certainly
socrates
and
i
affirm
that
he
is
most
miserable
and
that
those
who
are
punished
are
less
miserable
are
you
going
to
refute
this
proposition
also
polus
a
proposition
which
is
harder
of
refutation
than
the
other
socrates
socrates
say
rather
polus
impossible
for
who
can
refute
the
truth
polus
what
do
you
mean
if
a
man
is
detected
in
an
unjust
attempt
to
make
himself
a
tyrant
and
when
detected
is
racked
mutilated
has
his
eyes
burned
out
and
after
having
had
all
sorts
of
great
injuries
inflicted
on
him
and
having
seen
his
wife
and
children
suffer
the
like
is
at
last
impaled
or
tarred
and
burned
alive
will
he
be
happier
than
if
he
escape
and
become
a
tyrant
and
continue
all
through
life
doing
what
he
likes
and
holding
the
reins
of
government
the
envy
and
admiration
both
of
citizens
and
strangers
is
that
the
paradox
which
as
you
say
can
not
be
refuted
socrates
there
again
noble
polus
you
are
raising
hobgoblins
instead
of
refuting
me
just
now
you
were
calling
witnesses
against
me
but
please
to
refresh
my
memory
a
little
did
you
say
an
unjust
attempt
to
make
himself
a
tyrant
polus
yes
i
did
socrates
then
i
say
that
neither
of
them
will
be
happier
than
the
other
neither
he
who
unjustly
acquires
a
tyranny
nor
he
who
suffers
in
the
attempt
for
of
two
miserables
one
can
not
be
the
happier
but
that
he
who
escapes
and
becomes
a
tyrant
is
the
more
miserable
of
the
two
do
you
laugh
polus
well
this
is
a
new
kind
of
refutation
when
any
one
says
anything
instead
of
refuting
him
to
laugh
at
him
polus
but
do
you
not
think
socrates
that
you
have
been
sufficiently
refuted
when
you
say
that
which
no
human
being
will
allow
ask
the
company
socrates
o
polus
i
am
not
a
public
man
and
only
last
year
when
my
tribe
were
serving
as
prytanes
and
it
became
my
duty
as
their
president
to
take
the
votes
there
was
a
laugh
at
me
because
i
was
unable
to
take
them
and
as
i
failed
then
you
must
not
ask
me
to
count
the
suffrages
of
the
company
now
but
if
as
i
was
saying
you
have
no
better
argument
than
numbers
let
me
have
a
turn
and
do
you
make
trial
of
the
sort
of
proof
which
as
i
think
is
required
for
i
shall
produce
one
witness
only
of
the
truth
of
my
words
and
he
is
the
person
with
whom
i
am
arguing
his
suffrage
i
know
how
to
take
but
with
the
many
i
have
nothing
to
do
and
do
not
even
address
myself
to
them
may
i
ask
then
whether
you
will
answer
in
turn
and
have
your
words
put
to
the
proof
for
i
certainly
think
that
i
and
you
and
every
man
do
really
believe
that
to
do
is
a
greater
evil
than
to
suffer
injustice
and
not
to
be
punished
than
to
be
punished
polus
and
i
should
say
neither
i
nor
any
man
would
you
yourself
for
example
suffer
rather
than
do
injustice
socrates
yes
and
you
too
i
or
any
man
would
polus
quite
the
reverse
neither
you
nor
i
nor
any
man
socrates
but
will
you
answer
polus
to
be
sure
i
will
for
i
am
curious
to
hear
what
you
can
have
to
say
socrates
tell
me
then
and
you
will
know
and
let
us
suppose
that
i
am
beginning
at
the
beginning
which
of
the
two
polus
in
your
opinion
is
the
worst
to
do
injustice
or
to
suffer
polus
i
should
say
that
suffering
was
worst
socrates
and
which
is
the
greater
disgrace
answer
polus
to
do
socrates
and
the
greater
disgrace
is
the
greater
evil
polus
certainly
not
socrates
i
understand
you
to
say
if
i
am
not
mistaken
that
the
honourable
is
not
the
same
as
the
good
or
the
disgraceful
as
the
evil
polus
certainly
not
socrates
let
me
ask
a
question
of
you
when
you
speak
of
beautiful
things
such
as
bodies
colours
figures
sounds
institutions
do
you
not
call
them
beautiful
in
reference
to
some
standard
bodies
for
example
are
beautiful
in
proportion
as
they
are
useful
or
as
the
sight
of
them
gives
pleasure
to
the
spectators
can
you
give
any
other
account
of
personal
beauty
polus
i
can
not
socrates
and
you
would
say
of
figures
or
colours
generally
that
they
were
beautiful
either
by
reason
of
the
pleasure
which
they
give
or
of
their
use
or
of
both
polus
yes
i
should
socrates
and
you
would
call
sounds
and
music
beautiful
for
the
same
reason
polus
i
should
socrates
laws
and
institutions
also
have
no
beauty
in
them
except
in
so
far
as
they
are
useful
or
pleasant
or
both
polus
i
think
not
socrates
and
may
not
the
same
be
said
of
the
beauty
of
knowledge
polus
to
be
sure
socrates
and
i
very
much
approve
of
your
measuring
beauty
by
the
standard
of
pleasure
and
utility
socrates
and
deformity
or
disgrace
may
be
equally
measured
by
the
opposite
standard
of
pain
and
evil
polus
certainly
socrates
then
when
of
two
beautiful
things
one
exceeds
in
beauty
the
measure
of
the
excess
is
to
be
taken
in
one
or
both
of
these
that
is
to
say
in
pleasure
or
utility
or
both
polus
very
true
socrates
and
of
two
deformed
things
that
which
exceeds
in
deformity
or
disgrace
exceeds
either
in
pain
or
evil
must
it
not
be
so
polus
yes
socrates
but
then
again
what
was
the
observation
which
you
just
now
made
about
doing
and
suffering
wrong
did
you
not
say
that
suffering
wrong
was
more
evil
and
doing
wrong
more
disgraceful
polus
i
did
socrates
then
if
doing
wrong
is
more
disgraceful
than
suffering
the
more
disgraceful
must
be
more
painful
and
must
exceed
in
pain
or
in
evil
or
both
does
not
that
also
follow
polus
of
course
socrates
first
then
let
us
consider
whether
the
doing
of
injustice
exceeds
the
suffering
in
the
consequent
pain
do
the
injurers
suffer
more
than
the
injured
polus
no
socrates
certainly
not
socrates
then
they
do
not
exceed
in
pain
polus
no
socrates
but
if
not
in
pain
then
not
in
both
polus
certainly
not
socrates
then
they
can
only
exceed
in
the
other
polus
yes
socrates
that
is
to
say
in
evil
polus
true
socrates
then
doing
injustice
will
have
an
excess
of
evil
and
will
therefore
be
a
greater
evil
than
suffering
injustice
polus
clearly
socrates
but
have
not
you
and
the
world
already
agreed
that
to
do
injustice
is
more
disgraceful
than
to
suffer
polus
yes
socrates
and
that
is
now
discovered
to
be
more
evil
polus
true
socrates
and
would
you
prefer
a
greater
evil
or
a
greater
dishonour
to
a
less
one
answer
polus
and
fear
not
for
you
will
come
to
no
harm
if
you
nobly
resign
yourself
into
the
healing
hand
of
the
argument
as
to
a
physician
without
shrinking
and
either
say
or
to
me
polus
i
should
say
socrates
would
any
other
man
prefer
a
greater
to
a
less
evil
polus
no
not
according
to
this
way
of
putting
the
case
socrates
socrates
then
i
said
truly
polus
that
neither
you
nor
i
nor
any
man
would
rather
do
than
suffer
injustice
for
to
do
injustice
is
the
greater
evil
of
the
two
polus
that
is
the
conclusion
socrates
you
see
polus
when
you
compare
the
two
kinds
of
refutations
how
unlike
they
are
all
men
with
the
exception
of
myself
are
of
your
way
of
thinking
but
your
single
assent
and
witness
are
enough
for
me
i
have
no
need
of
any
other
i
take
your
suffrage
and
am
regardless
of
the
rest
enough
of
this
and
now
let
us
proceed
to
the
next
question
which
is
whether
the
greatest
of
evils
to
a
guilty
man
is
to
suffer
punishment
as
you
supposed
or
whether
to
escape
punishment
is
not
a
greater
evil
as
i
supposed
consider
you
would
say
that
to
suffer
punishment
is
another
name
for
being
justly
corrected
when
you
do
wrong
polus
i
should
socrates
and
would
you
not
allow
that
all
just
things
are
honourable
in
so
far
as
they
are
just
please
to
reflect
and
tell
me
your
opinion
polus
yes
socrates
i
think
that
they
are
socrates
consider
again
where
there
is
an
agent
must
there
not
also
be
a
patient
polus
i
should
say
so
socrates
and
will
not
the
patient
suffer
that
which
the
agent
does
and
will
not
the
suffering
have
the
quality
of
the
action
i
mean
for
example
that
if
a
man
strikes
there
must
be
something
which
is
stricken
polus
yes
socrates
and
if
the
striker
strikes
violently
or
quickly
that
which
is
struck
will
be
struck
violently
or
quickly
polus
true
socrates
and
the
suffering
to
him
who
is
stricken
is
of
the
same
nature
as
the
act
of
him
who
strikes
polus
yes
socrates
and
if
a
man
burns
there
is
something
which
is
burned
polus
certainly
socrates
and
if
he
burns
in
excess
or
so
as
to
cause
pain
the
thing
burned
will
be
burned
in
the
same
way
polus
truly
socrates
and
if
he
cuts
the
same
argument
holds
there
will
be
something
cut
polus
yes
socrates
and
if
the
cutting
be
great
or
deep
or
such
as
will
cause
pain
the
cut
will
be
of
the
same
nature
polus
that
is
evident
socrates
then
you
would
agree
generally
to
the
universal
proposition
which
i
was
just
now
asserting
that
the
affection
of
the
patient
answers
to
the
affection
of
the
agent
polus
i
agree
socrates
then
as
this
is
admitted
let
me
ask
whether
being
punished
is
suffering
or
acting
polus
suffering
socrates
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
that
socrates
and
suffering
implies
an
agent
polus
certainly
socrates
and
he
is
the
punisher
socrates
and
he
who
punishes
rightly
punishes
justly
polus
yes
socrates
and
therefore
he
acts
justly
polus
justly
socrates
then
he
who
is
punished
and
suffers
retribution
suffers
justly
polus
that
is
evident
socrates
and
that
which
is
just
has
been
admitted
to
be
honourable
polus
certainly
socrates
then
the
punisher
does
what
is
honourable
and
the
punished
suffers
what
is
honourable
polus
true
socrates
and
if
what
is
honourable
then
what
is
good
for
the
honourable
is
either
pleasant
or
useful
polus
certainly
socrates
then
he
who
is
punished
suffers
what
is
good
polus
that
is
true
socrates
then
he
is
benefited
polus
yes
socrates
do
i
understand
you
to
mean
what
i
mean
by
the
term
i
mean
that
if
he
be
justly
punished
his
soul
is
improved
polus
surely
socrates
then
he
who
is
punished
is
delivered
from
the
evil
of
his
soul
polus
yes
socrates
and
is
he
not
then
delivered
from
the
greatest
evil
look
at
the
matter
in
this
way
in
respect
of
a
man
estate
do
you
see
any
greater
evil
than
poverty
polus
there
is
no
greater
evil
socrates
again
in
a
man
bodily
frame
you
would
say
that
the
evil
is
weakness
and
disease
and
deformity
polus
i
should
socrates
and
do
you
not
imagine
that
the
soul
likewise
has
some
evil
of
her
own
polus
of
course
socrates
and
this
you
would
call
injustice
and
ignorance
and
cowardice
and
the
like
polus
certainly
socrates
so
then
in
mind
body
and
estate
which
are
three
you
have
pointed
out
three
corresponding
evils
injustice
disease
poverty
polus
true
socrates
and
which
of
the
evils
is
the
most
disgraceful
is
not
the
most
disgraceful
of
them
injustice
and
in
general
the
evil
of
the
soul
polus
by
far
the
most
socrates
and
if
the
most
disgraceful
then
also
the
worst
polus
what
do
you
mean
socrates
socrates
i
mean
to
say
that
is
most
disgraceful
has
been
already
admitted
to
be
most
painful
or
hurtful
or
both
polus
certainly
socrates
and
now
injustice
and
all
evil
in
the
soul
has
been
admitted
by
us
to
be
most
disgraceful
polus
it
has
been
admitted
socrates
and
most
disgraceful
either
because
most
painful
and
causing
excessive
pain
or
most
hurtful
or
both
polus
certainly
socrates
and
therefore
to
be
unjust
and
intemperate
and
cowardly
and
ignorant
is
more
painful
than
to
be
poor
and
sick
polus
nay
socrates
the
painfulness
does
not
appear
to
me
to
follow
from
your
premises
socrates
then
if
as
you
would
argue
not
more
painful
the
evil
of
the
soul
is
of
all
evils
the
most
disgraceful
and
the
excess
of
disgrace
must
be
caused
by
some
preternatural
greatness
or
extraordinary
hurtfulness
of
the
evil
polus
clearly
socrates
and
that
which
exceeds
most
in
hurtfulness
will
be
the
greatest
of
evils
polus
yes
socrates
then
injustice
and
intemperance
and
in
general
the
depravity
of
the
soul
are
the
greatest
of
evils
polus
that
is
evident
socrates
now
what
art
is
there
which
delivers
us
from
poverty
does
not
the
art
of
making
money
polus
yes
socrates
and
what
art
frees
us
from
disease
does
not
the
art
of
medicine
polus
very
true
socrates
and
what
from
vice
and
injustice
if
you
are
not
able
to
answer
at
once
ask
yourself
whither
we
go
with
the
sick
and
to
whom
we
take
them
polus
to
the
physicians
socrates
socrates
and
to
whom
do
we
go
with
the
unjust
and
intemperate
polus
to
the
judges
you
mean
socrates
who
are
to
punish
them
polus
yes
socrates
and
do
not
those
who
rightly
punish
others
punish
them
in
accordance
with
a
certain
rule
of
justice
polus
clearly
socrates
then
the
art
of
frees
a
man
from
poverty
medicine
from
disease
and
justice
from
intemperance
and
injustice
polus
that
is
evident
socrates
which
then
is
the
best
of
these
three
polus
will
you
enumerate
them
socrates
medicine
and
justice
polus
justice
socrates
far
excels
the
two
others
socrates
and
justice
if
the
best
gives
the
greatest
pleasure
or
advantage
or
both
polus
yes
socrates
but
is
the
being
healed
a
pleasant
thing
and
are
those
who
are
being
healed
pleased
polus
i
think
not
socrates
a
useful
thing
then
polus
yes
socrates
yes
because
the
patient
is
delivered
from
a
great
evil
and
this
is
the
advantage
of
enduring
the
pain
that
you
get
well
polus
certainly
socrates
and
would
he
be
the
happier
man
in
his
bodily
condition
who
is
healed
or
who
never
was
out
of
health
polus
clearly
he
who
was
never
out
of
health
socrates
yes
for
happiness
surely
does
not
consist
in
being
delivered
from
evils
but
in
never
having
had
them
polus
true
socrates
and
suppose
the
case
of
two
persons
who
have
some
evil
in
their
bodies
and
that
one
of
them
is
healed
and
delivered
from
evil
and
another
is
not
healed
but
retains
the
evil
which
of
them
is
the
most
miserable
polus
clearly
he
who
is
not
healed
socrates
and
was
not
punishment
said
by
us
to
be
a
deliverance
from
the
greatest
of
evils
which
is
vice
polus
true
socrates
and
justice
punishes
us
and
makes
us
more
just
and
is
the
medicine
of
our
vice
polus
true
socrates
he
then
has
the
first
place
in
the
scale
of
happiness
who
has
never
had
vice
in
his
soul
for
this
has
been
shown
to
be
the
greatest
of
evils
polus
clearly
socrates
and
he
has
the
second
place
who
is
delivered
from
vice
polus
true
socrates
that
is
to
say
he
who
receives
admonition
and
rebuke
and
punishment
polus
yes
socrates
then
he
lives
worst
who
having
been
unjust
has
no
deliverance
from
injustice
polus
certainly
socrates
that
is
he
lives
worst
who
commits
the
greatest
crimes
and
who
being
the
most
unjust
of
men
succeeds
in
escaping
rebuke
or
correction
or
punishment
and
this
as
you
say
has
been
accomplished
by
archelaus
and
other
tyrants
and
rhetoricians
and
potentates
compare
republic
polus
true
socrates
may
not
their
way
of
proceeding
my
friend
be
compared
to
the
conduct
of
a
person
who
is
afflicted
with
the
worst
of
diseases
and
yet
contrives
not
to
pay
the
penalty
to
the
physician
for
his
sins
against
his
constitution
and
will
not
be
cured
because
like
a
child
he
is
afraid
of
the
pain
of
being
burned
or
cut
is
not
that
a
parallel
case
polus
yes
truly
socrates
he
would
seem
as
if
he
did
not
know
the
nature
of
health
and
bodily
vigour
and
if
we
are
right
polus
in
our
previous
conclusions
they
are
in
a
like
case
who
strive
to
evade
justice
which
they
see
to
be
painful
but
are
blind
to
the
advantage
which
ensues
from
it
not
knowing
how
far
more
miserable
a
companion
a
diseased
soul
is
than
a
diseased
body
a
soul
i
say
which
is
corrupt
and
unrighteous
and
unholy
and
hence
they
do
all
that
they
can
to
avoid
punishment
and
to
avoid
being
released
from
the
greatest
of
evils
they
provide
themselves
with
money
and
friends
and
cultivate
to
the
utmost
their
powers
of
persuasion
but
if
we
polus
are
right
do
you
see
what
follows
or
shall
we
draw
out
the
consequences
in
form
polus
if
you
please
socrates
is
it
not
a
fact
that
injustice
and
the
doing
of
injustice
is
the
greatest
of
evils
polus
that
is
quite
clear
socrates
and
further
that
to
suffer
punishment
is
the
way
to
be
released
from
this
evil
polus
true
socrates
and
not
to
suffer
is
to
perpetuate
the
evil
polus
yes
socrates
to
do
wrong
then
is
second
only
in
the
scale
of
evils
but
to
do
wrong
and
not
to
be
punished
is
first
and
greatest
of
all
polus
that
is
true
socrates
well
and
was
not
this
the
point
in
dispute
my
friend
you
deemed
archelaus
happy
because
he
was
a
very
great
criminal
and
unpunished
i
on
the
other
hand
maintained
that
he
or
any
other
who
like
him
has
done
wrong
and
has
not
been
punished
is
and
ought
to
be
the
most
miserable
of
all
men
and
that
the
doer
of
injustice
is
more
miserable
than
the
sufferer
and
he
who
escapes
punishment
more
miserable
than
he
who
was
not
that
what
i
said
polus
yes
socrates
and
it
has
been
proved
to
be
true
polus
certainly
socrates
well
polus
but
if
this
is
true
where
is
the
great
use
of
rhetoric
if
we
admit
what
has
been
just
now
said
every
man
ought
in
every
way
to
guard
himself
against
doing
wrong
for
he
will
thereby
suffer
great
evil
polus
true
socrates
and
if
he
or
any
one
about
whom
he
cares
does
wrong
he
ought
of
his
own
accord
to
go
where
he
will
be
immediately
punished
he
will
run
to
the
judge
as
he
would
to
the
physician
in
order
that
the
disease
of
injustice
may
not
be
rendered
chronic
and
become
the
incurable
cancer
of
the
soul
must
we
not
allow
this
consequence
polus
if
our
former
admissions
are
to
stand
is
any
other
inference
consistent
with
them
polus
to
that
socrates
there
can
be
but
one
answer
socrates
then
rhetoric
is
of
no
use
to
us
polus
in
helping
a
man
to
excuse
his
own
injustice
that
of
his
parents
or
friends
or
children
or
country
but
may
be
of
use
to
any
one
who
holds
that
instead
of
excusing
he
ought
to
accuse
himself
above
all
and
in
the
next
degree
his
family
or
any
of
his
friends
who
may
be
doing
wrong
he
should
bring
to
light
the
iniquity
and
not
conceal
it
that
so
the
may
suffer
and
be
made
whole
and
he
should
even
force
himself
and
others
not
to
shrink
but
with
closed
eyes
like
brave
men
to
let
the
physician
operate
with
knife
or
searing
iron
not
regarding
the
pain
in
the
hope
of
attaining
the
good
and
the
honourable
let
him
who
has
done
things
worthy
of
stripes
allow
himself
to
be
scourged
if
of
bonds
to
be
bound
if
of
a
fine
to
be
fined
if
of
exile
to
be
exiled
if
of
death
to
die
himself
being
the
first
to
accuse
himself
and
his
own
relations
and
using
rhetoric
to
this
end
that
his
and
their
unjust
actions
may
be
made
manifest
and
that
they
themselves
may
be
delivered
from
injustice
which
is
the
greatest
evil
then
polus
rhetoric
would
indeed
be
useful
do
you
say
or
to
that
polus
to
me
socrates
what
you
are
saying
appears
very
strange
though
probably
in
agreement
with
your
premises
socrates
is
not
this
the
conclusion
if
the
premises
are
not
disproven
polus
yes
it
certainly
is
socrates
and
from
the
opposite
point
of
view
if
indeed
it
be
our
duty
to
harm
another
whether
an
enemy
or
not
i
except
the
case
of
then
i
have
to
be
upon
my
guard
but
if
my
enemy
injures
a
third
person
then
in
every
sort
of
way
by
word
as
well
as
deed
i
should
try
to
prevent
his
being
punished
or
appearing
before
the
judge
and
if
he
appears
i
should
contrive
that
he
should
escape
and
not
suffer
punishment
if
he
has
stolen
a
sum
of
money
let
him
keep
what
he
has
stolen
and
spend
it
on
him
and
his
regardless
of
religion
and
justice
and
if
he
have
done
things
worthy
of
death
let
him
not
die
but
rather
be
immortal
in
his
wickedness
or
if
this
is
not
possible
let
him
at
any
rate
be
allowed
to
live
as
long
as
he
can
for
such
purposes
polus
rhetoric
may
be
useful
but
is
of
small
if
of
any
use
to
him
who
is
not
intending
to
commit
injustice
at
least
there
was
no
such
use
discovered
by
us
in
the
previous
discussion
callicles
tell
me
chaerephon
is
socrates
in
earnest
or
is
he
joking
chaerephon
i
should
say
callicles
that
he
is
in
most
profound
earnest
but
you
may
well
ask
him
callicles
by
the
gods
and
i
will
tell
me
socrates
are
you
in
earnest
or
only
in
jest
for
if
you
are
in
earnest
and
what
you
say
is
true
is
not
the
whole
of
human
life
turned
upside
down
and
are
we
not
doing
as
would
appear
in
everything
the
opposite
of
what
we
ought
to
be
doing
socrates
o
callicles
if
there
were
not
some
community
of
feelings
among
mankind
however
varying
in
different
persons
i
mean
to
say
if
every
man
feelings
were
peculiar
to
himself
and
were
not
shared
by
the
rest
of
his
species
i
do
not
see
how
we
could
ever
communicate
our
impressions
to
one
another
i
make
this
remark
because
i
perceive
that
you
and
i
have
a
common
feeling
for
we
are
lovers
both
and
both
of
us
have
two
loves
apiece
i
am
the
lover
of
alcibiades
the
son
of
cleinias
and
of
philosophy
and
you
of
the
athenian
demus
and
of
demus
the
son
of
pyrilampes
now
i
observe
that
you
with
all
your
cleverness
do
not
venture
to
contradict
your
favourite
in
any
word
or
opinion
of
his
but
as
he
changes
you
change
backwards
and
forwards
when
the
athenian
demus
denies
anything
that
you
are
saying
in
the
assembly
you
go
over
to
his
opinion
and
you
do
the
same
with
demus
the
fair
young
son
of
pyrilampes
for
you
have
not
the
power
to
resist
the
words
and
ideas
of
your
loves
and
if
a
person
were
to
express
surprise
at
the
strangeness
of
what
you
say
from
time
to
time
when
under
their
influence
you
would
probably
reply
to
him
if
you
were
honest
that
you
can
not
help
saying
what
your
loves
say
unless
they
are
prevented
and
that
you
can
only
be
silent
when
they
are
now
you
must
understand
that
my
words
are
an
echo
too
and
therefore
you
need
not
wonder
at
me
but
if
you
want
to
silence
me
silence
philosophy
who
is
my
love
for
she
is
always
telling
me
what
i
am
now
telling
you
my
friend
neither
is
she
capricious
like
my
other
love
for
the
son
of
cleinias
says
one
thing
and
another
thing
but
philosophy
is
always
true
she
is
the
teacher
at
whose
words
you
are
now
wondering
and
you
have
heard
her
yourself
her
you
must
refute
and
either
show
as
i
was
saying
that
to
do
injustice
and
to
escape
punishment
is
not
the
worst
of
all
evils
or
if
you
leave
her
word
unrefuted
by
the
dog
the
god
of
egypt
i
declare
o
callicles
that
callicles
will
never
be
at
one
with
himself
but
that
his
whole
life
will
be
a
discord
and
yet
my
friend
i
would
rather
that
my
lyre
should
be
inharmonious
and
that
there
should
be
no
music
in
the
chorus
which
i
provided
aye
or
that
the
whole
world
should
be
at
odds
with
me
and
oppose
me
rather
than
that
i
myself
should
be
at
odds
with
myself
and
contradict
myself
callicles
o
socrates
you
are
a
regular
declaimer
and
seem
to
be
running
riot
in
the
argument
and
now
you
are
declaiming
in
this
way
because
polus
has
fallen
into
the
same
error
himself
of
which
he
accused
gorgias
for
he
said
that
when
gorgias
was
asked
by
you
whether
if
some
one
came
to
him
who
wanted
to
learn
rhetoric
and
did
not
know
justice
he
would
teach
him
justice
gorgias
in
his
modesty
replied
that
he
would
because
he
thought
that
mankind
in
general
would
be
displeased
if
he
answered
and
then
in
consequence
of
this
admission
gorgias
was
compelled
to
contradict
himself
that
being
just
the
sort
of
thing
in
which
you
delight
whereupon
polus
laughed
at
you
deservedly
as
i
think
but
now
he
has
himself
fallen
into
the
same
trap
i
can
not
say
very
much
for
his
wit
when
he
conceded
to
you
that
to
do
is
more
dishonourable
than
to
suffer
injustice
for
this
was
the
admission
which
led
to
his
being
entangled
by
you
and
because
he
was
too
modest
to
say
what
he
thought
he
had
his
mouth
stopped
for
the
truth
is
socrates
that
you
who
pretend
to
be
engaged
in
the
pursuit
of
truth
are
appealing
now
to
the
popular
and
vulgar
notions
of
right
which
are
not
natural
but
only
conventional
convention
and
nature
are
generally
at
variance
with
one
another
and
hence
if
a
person
is
too
modest
to
say
what
he
thinks
he
is
compelled
to
contradict
himself
and
you
in
your
ingenuity
perceiving
the
advantage
to
be
thereby
gained
slyly
ask
of
him
who
is
arguing
conventionally
a
question
which
is
to
be
determined
by
the
rule
of
nature
and
if
he
is
talking
of
the
rule
of
nature
you
slip
away
to
custom
as
for
instance
you
did
in
this
very
discussion
about
doing
and
suffering
injustice
when
polus
was
speaking
of
the
conventionally
dishonourable
you
assailed
him
from
the
point
of
view
of
nature
for
by
the
rule
of
nature
to
suffer
injustice
is
the
greater
disgrace
because
the
greater
evil
but
conventionally
to
do
evil
is
the
more
disgraceful
for
the
suffering
of
injustice
is
not
the
part
of
a
man
but
of
a
slave
who
indeed
had
better
die
than
live
since
when
he
is
wronged
and
trampled
upon
he
is
unable
to
help
himself
or
any
other
about
whom
he
cares
the
reason
as
i
conceive
is
that
the
makers
of
laws
are
the
majority
who
are
weak
and
they
make
laws
and
distribute
praises
and
censures
with
a
view
to
themselves
and
to
their
own
interests
and
they
terrify
the
stronger
sort
of
men
and
those
who
are
able
to
get
the
better
of
them
in
order
that
they
may
not
get
the
better
of
them
and
they
say
that
dishonesty
is
shameful
and
unjust
meaning
by
the
word
injustice
the
desire
of
a
man
to
have
more
than
his
neighbours
for
knowing
their
own
inferiority
i
suspect
that
they
are
too
glad
of
equality
and
therefore
the
endeavour
to
have
more
than
the
many
is
conventionally
said
to
be
shameful
and
unjust
and
is
called
injustice
compare
republic
whereas
nature
herself
intimates
that
it
is
just
for
the
better
to
have
more
than
the
worse
the
more
powerful
than
the
weaker
and
in
many
ways
she
shows
among
men
as
well
as
among
animals
and
indeed
among
whole
cities
and
races
that
justice
consists
in
the
superior
ruling
over
and
having
more
than
the
inferior
for
on
what
principle
of
justice
did
xerxes
invade
hellas
or
his
father
the
scythians
not
to
speak
of
numberless
other
examples
nay
but
these
are
the
men
who
act
according
to
nature
yes
by
heaven
and
according
to
the
law
of
nature
not
perhaps
according
to
that
artificial
law
which
we
invent
and
impose
upon
our
fellows
of
whom
we
take
the
best
and
strongest
from
their
youth
upwards
and
tame
them
like
young
lions
charming
them
with
the
sound
of
the
voice
and
saying
to
them
that
with
equality
they
must
be
content
and
that
the
equal
is
the
honourable
and
the
just
but
if
there
were
a
man
who
had
sufficient
force
he
would
shake
off
and
break
through
and
escape
from
all
this
he
would
trample
under
foot
all
our
formulas
and
spells
and
charms
and
all
our
laws
which
are
against
nature
the
slave
would
rise
in
rebellion
and
be
lord
over
us
and
the
light
of
natural
justice
would
shine
forth
and
this
i
take
to
be
the
sentiment
of
pindar
when
he
says
in
his
poem
that
is
the
king
of
all
of
mortals
as
well
as
of
immortals
this
as
he
says
might
to
be
right
doing
violence
with
highest
hand
as
i
infer
from
the
deeds
of
heracles
for
without
buying
them
fragm
incert
bockh
i
do
not
remember
the
exact
words
but
the
meaning
is
that
without
buying
them
and
without
their
being
given
to
him
he
carried
off
the
oxen
of
geryon
according
to
the
law
of
natural
right
and
that
the
oxen
and
other
possessions
of
the
weaker
and
inferior
properly
belong
to
the
stronger
and
superior
and
this
is
true
as
you
may
ascertain
if
you
will
leave
philosophy
and
go
on
to
higher
things
for
philosophy
socrates
if
pursued
in
moderation
and
at
the
proper
age
is
an
elegant
accomplishment
but
too
much
philosophy
is
the
ruin
of
human
life
even
if
a
man
has
good
parts
still
if
he
carries
philosophy
into
later
life
he
is
necessarily
ignorant
of
all
those
things
which
a
gentleman
and
a
person
of
honour
ought
to
know
he
is
inexperienced
in
the
laws
of
the
state
and
in
the
language
which
ought
to
be
used
in
the
dealings
of
man
with
man
whether
private
or
public
and
utterly
ignorant
of
the
pleasures
and
desires
of
mankind
and
of
human
character
in
general
and
people
of
this
sort
when
they
betake
themselves
to
politics
or
business
are
as
ridiculous
as
i
imagine
the
politicians
to
be
when
they
make
their
appearance
in
the
arena
of
philosophy
for
as
euripides
says
man
shines
in
that
and
pursues
that
and
devotes
the
greatest
portion
of
the
day
to
that
in
which
he
most
excels
antiope
fragm
dindorf
but
anything
in
which
he
is
inferior
he
avoids
and
depreciates
and
praises
the
opposite
from
partiality
to
himself
and
because
he
thinks
that
he
will
thus
praise
himself
the
true
principle
is
to
unite
them
philosophy
as
a
part
of
education
is
an
excellent
thing
and
there
is
no
disgrace
to
a
man
while
he
is
young
in
pursuing
such
a
study
but
when
he
is
more
advanced
in
years
the
thing
becomes
ridiculous
and
i
feel
towards
philosophers
as
i
do
towards
those
who
lisp
and
imitate
children
for
i
love
to
see
a
little
child
who
is
not
of
an
age
to
speak
plainly
lisping
at
his
play
there
is
an
appearance
of
grace
and
freedom
in
his
utterance
which
is
natural
to
his
childish
years
but
when
i
hear
some
small
creature
carefully
articulating
its
words
i
am
offended
the
sound
is
disagreeable
and
has
to
my
ears
the
twang
of
slavery
so
when
i
hear
a
man
lisping
or
see
him
playing
like
a
child
his
behaviour
appears
to
me
ridiculous
and
unmanly
and
worthy
of
stripes
and
i
have
the
same
feeling
about
students
of
philosophy
when
i
see
a
youth
thus
engaged
the
study
appears
to
me
to
be
in
character
and
becoming
a
man
of
liberal
education
and
him
who
neglects
philosophy
i
regard
as
an
inferior
man
who
will
never
aspire
to
anything
great
or
noble
but
if
i
see
him
continuing
the
study
in
later
life
and
not
leaving
off
i
should
like
to
beat
him
socrates
for
as
i
was
saying
such
a
one
even
though
he
have
good
natural
parts
becomes
effeminate
he
flies
from
the
busy
centre
and
the
in
which
as
the
poet
says
men
become
distinguished
he
creeps
into
a
corner
for
the
rest
of
his
life
and
talks
in
a
whisper
with
three
or
four
admiring
youths
but
never
speaks
out
like
a
freeman
in
a
satisfactory
manner
now
i
socrates
am
very
well
inclined
towards
you
and
my
feeling
may
be
compared
with
that
of
zethus
towards
amphion
in
the
play
of
euripides
whom
i
was
mentioning
just
now
for
i
am
disposed
to
say
to
you
much
what
zethus
said
to
his
brother
that
you
socrates
are
careless
about
the
things
of
which
you
ought
to
be
careful
and
that
you
have
a
soul
so
noble
are
remarkable
for
a
puerile
exterior
neither
in
a
court
of
justice
could
you
state
a
case
or
give
any
reason
or
proof
or
offer
valiant
counsel
on
another
behalf
and
you
must
not
be
offended
my
dear
socrates
for
i
am
speaking
out
of
towards
you
if
i
ask
whether
you
are
not
ashamed
of
being
thus
defenceless
which
i
affirm
to
be
the
condition
not
of
you
only
but
of
all
those
who
will
carry
the
study
of
philosophy
too
far
for
suppose
that
some
one
were
to
take
you
or
any
one
of
your
sort
off
to
prison
declaring
that
you
had
done
wrong
when
you
had
done
no
wrong
you
must
allow
that
you
would
not
know
what
to
do
there
you
would
stand
giddy
and
gaping
and
not
having
a
word
to
say
and
when
you
went
up
before
the
court
even
if
the
accuser
were
a
poor
creature
and
not
good
for
much
you
would
die
if
he
were
disposed
to
claim
the
penalty
of
death
and
yet
socrates
what
is
the
value
of
art
which
converts
a
man
of
sense
into
a
fool
who
is
helpless
and
has
no
power
to
save
either
himself
or
others
when
he
is
in
the
greatest
danger
and
is
going
to
be
despoiled
by
his
enemies
of
all
his
goods
and
has
to
live
simply
deprived
of
his
rights
of
citizenship
he
being
a
man
who
if
i
may
use
the
expression
may
be
boxed
on
the
ears
with
impunity
then
my
good
friend
take
my
advice
and
refute
no
more
the
philosophy
of
business
and
acquire
the
reputation
of
wisdom
but
leave
to
others
these
niceties
whether
they
are
to
be
described
as
follies
or
absurdities
they
will
only
give
you
poverty
for
the
inmate
of
your
dwelling
cease
then
emulating
these
paltry
splitters
of
words
and
emulate
only
the
man
of
substance
and
honour
who
is
well
to
do
socrates
if
my
soul
callicles
were
made
of
gold
should
i
not
rejoice
to
discover
one
of
those
stones
with
which
they
test
gold
and
the
very
best
possible
one
to
which
i
might
bring
my
soul
and
if
the
stone
and
i
agreed
in
approving
of
her
training
then
i
should
know
that
i
was
in
a
satisfactory
state
and
that
no
other
test
was
needed
by
me
callicles
what
is
your
meaning
socrates
socrates
i
will
tell
you
i
think
that
i
have
found
in
you
the
desired
touchstone
callicles
why
socrates
because
i
am
sure
that
if
you
agree
with
me
in
any
of
the
opinions
which
my
soul
forms
i
have
at
last
found
the
truth
indeed
for
i
consider
that
if
a
man
is
to
make
a
complete
trial
of
the
good
or
evil
of
the
soul
he
ought
to
have
three
qualities
knowledge
outspokenness
which
are
all
possessed
by
you
many
whom
i
meet
are
unable
to
make
trial
of
me
because
they
are
not
wise
as
you
are
others
are
wise
but
they
will
not
tell
me
the
truth
because
they
have
not
the
same
interest
in
me
which
you
have
and
these
two
strangers
gorgias
and
polus
are
undoubtedly
wise
men
and
my
very
good
friends
but
they
are
not
outspoken
enough
and
they
are
too
modest
why
their
modesty
is
so
great
that
they
are
driven
to
contradict
themselves
first
one
and
then
the
other
of
them
in
the
face
of
a
large
company
on
matters
of
the
highest
moment
but
you
have
all
the
qualities
in
which
these
others
are
deficient
having
received
an
excellent
education
to
this
many
athenians
can
testify
and
you
are
my
friend
shall
i
tell
you
why
i
think
so
i
know
that
you
callicles
and
tisander
of
aphidnae
and
andron
the
son
of
androtion
and
nausicydes
of
the
deme
of
cholarges
studied
together
there
were
four
of
you
and
i
once
heard
you
advising
with
one
another
as
to
the
extent
to
which
the
pursuit
of
philosophy
should
be
carried
and
as
i
know
you
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
study
should
not
be
pushed
too
much
into
detail
you
were
cautioning
one
another
not
to
be
overwise
you
were
afraid
that
too
much
wisdom
might
unconsciously
to
yourselves
be
the
ruin
of
you
and
now
when
i
hear
you
giving
the
same
advice
to
me
which
you
then
gave
to
your
most
intimate
friends
i
have
a
sufficient
evidence
of
your
real
to
me
and
of
the
frankness
of
your
nature
and
freedom
from
modesty
i
am
assured
by
yourself
and
the
assurance
is
confirmed
by
your
last
speech
well
then
the
inference
in
the
present
case
clearly
is
that
if
you
agree
with
me
in
an
argument
about
any
point
that
point
will
have
been
sufficiently
tested
by
us
and
will
not
require
to
be
submitted
to
any
further
test
for
you
could
not
have
agreed
with
me
either
from
lack
of
knowledge
or
from
superfluity
of
modesty
nor
yet
from
a
desire
to
deceive
me
for
you
are
my
friend
as
you
tell
me
yourself
and
therefore
when
you
and
i
are
agreed
the
result
will
be
the
attainment
of
perfect
truth
now
there
is
no
nobler
enquiry
callicles
than
that
which
you
censure
me
for
making
what
ought
the
character
of
a
man
to
be
and
what
his
pursuits
and
how
far
is
he
to
go
both
in
maturer
years
and
in
youth
for
be
assured
that
if
i
err
in
my
own
conduct
i
do
not
err
intentionally
but
from
ignorance
do
not
then
desist
from
advising
me
now
that
you
have
begun
until
i
have
learned
clearly
what
this
is
which
i
am
to
practise
and
how
i
may
acquire
it
and
if
you
find
me
assenting
to
your
words
and
hereafter
not
doing
that
to
which
i
assented
call
me
and
deem
me
unworthy
of
receiving
further
instruction
once
more
then
tell
me
what
you
and
pindar
mean
by
natural
justice
do
you
not
mean
that
the
superior
should
take
the
property
of
the
inferior
by
force
that
the
better
should
rule
the
worse
the
noble
have
more
than
the
mean
am
i
not
right
in
my
recollection
callicles
yes
that
is
what
i
was
saying
and
so
i
still
aver
socrates
and
do
you
mean
by
the
better
the
same
as
the
superior
for
i
could
not
make
out
what
you
were
saying
at
the
time
whether
you
meant
by
the
superior
the
stronger
and
that
the
weaker
must
obey
the
stronger
as
you
seemed
to
imply
when
you
said
that
great
cities
attack
small
ones
in
accordance
with
natural
right
because
they
are
superior
and
stronger
as
though
the
superior
and
stronger
and
better
were
the
same
or
whether
the
better
may
be
also
the
inferior
and
weaker
and
the
superior
the
worse
or
whether
better
is
to
be
defined
in
the
same
way
as
superior
this
is
the
point
which
i
want
to
have
cleared
up
are
the
superior
and
better
and
stronger
the
same
or
different
callicles
i
say
unequivocally
that
they
are
the
same
socrates
then
the
many
are
by
nature
superior
to
the
one
against
whom
as
you
were
saying
they
make
the
laws
callicles
certainly
socrates
then
the
laws
of
the
many
are
the
laws
of
the
superior
callicles
very
true
socrates
then
they
are
the
laws
of
the
better
for
the
superior
class
are
far
better
as
you
were
saying
callicles
yes
socrates
and
since
they
are
superior
the
laws
which
are
made
by
them
are
by
nature
good
callicles
yes
socrates
and
are
not
the
many
of
opinion
as
you
were
lately
saying
that
justice
is
equality
and
that
to
do
is
more
disgraceful
than
to
suffer
injustice
is
that
so
or
not
answer
callicles
and
let
no
modesty
be
found
to
come
in
the
way
do
the
many
think
or
do
they
not
think
thus
i
must
beg
of
you
to
answer
in
order
that
if
you
agree
with
me
i
may
fortify
myself
by
the
assent
of
so
competent
an
authority
callicles
yes
the
opinion
of
the
many
is
what
you
say
socrates
then
not
only
custom
but
nature
also
affirms
that
to
do
is
more
disgraceful
than
to
suffer
injustice
and
that
justice
is
equality
so
that
you
seem
to
have
been
wrong
in
your
former
assertion
when
accusing
me
you
said
that
nature
and
custom
are
opposed
and
that
i
knowing
this
was
dishonestly
playing
between
them
appealing
to
custom
when
the
argument
is
about
nature
and
to
nature
when
the
argument
is
about
custom
callicles
this
man
will
never
cease
talking
nonsense
at
your
age
socrates
are
you
not
ashamed
to
be
catching
at
words
and
chuckling
over
some
verbal
slip
do
you
not
see
have
i
not
told
you
already
that
by
superior
i
mean
better
do
you
imagine
me
to
say
that
if
a
rabble
of
slaves
and
nondescripts
who
are
of
no
use
except
perhaps
for
their
physical
strength
get
together
their
ipsissima
verba
are
laws
socrates
ho
my
philosopher
is
that
your
line
callicles
certainly
socrates
i
was
thinking
callicles
that
something
of
the
kind
must
have
been
in
your
mind
and
that
is
why
i
repeated
the
question
what
is
the
superior
i
wanted
to
know
clearly
what
you
meant
for
you
surely
do
not
think
that
two
men
are
better
than
one
or
that
your
slaves
are
better
than
you
because
they
are
stronger
then
please
to
begin
again
and
tell
me
who
the
better
are
if
they
are
not
the
stronger
and
i
will
ask
you
great
sir
to
be
a
little
milder
in
your
instructions
or
i
shall
have
to
run
away
from
you
callicles
you
are
ironical
socrates
no
by
the
hero
zethus
callicles
by
whose
aid
you
were
just
now
saying
many
ironical
things
against
me
i
am
not
tell
me
then
whom
you
mean
by
the
better
callicles
i
mean
the
more
excellent
socrates
do
you
not
see
that
you
are
yourself
using
words
which
have
no
meaning
and
that
you
are
explaining
nothing
will
you
tell
me
whether
you
mean
by
the
better
and
superior
the
wiser
or
if
not
whom
callicles
most
assuredly
i
do
mean
the
wiser
socrates
then
according
to
you
one
wise
man
may
often
be
superior
to
ten
thousand
fools
and
he
ought
to
rule
them
and
they
ought
to
be
his
subjects
and
he
ought
to
have
more
than
they
should
this
is
what
i
believe
that
you
mean
and
you
must
not
suppose
that
i
am
if
you
allow
that
the
one
is
superior
to
the
ten
thousand
callicles
yes
that
is
what
i
mean
and
that
is
what
i
conceive
to
be
natural
justice
that
the
better
and
wiser
should
rule
and
have
more
than
the
inferior
socrates
stop
there
and
let
me
ask
you
what
you
would
say
in
this
case
let
us
suppose
that
we
are
all
together
as
we
are
now
there
are
several
of
us
and
we
have
a
large
common
store
of
meats
and
drinks
and
there
are
all
sorts
of
persons
in
our
company
having
various
degrees
of
strength
and
weakness
and
one
of
us
being
a
physician
is
wiser
in
the
matter
of
food
than
all
the
rest
and
he
is
probably
stronger
than
some
and
not
so
strong
as
others
of
us
will
he
not
being
wiser
be
also
better
than
we
are
and
our
superior
in
this
matter
of
food
callicles
certainly
socrates
either
then
he
will
have
a
larger
share
of
the
meats
and
drinks
because
he
is
better
or
he
will
have
the
distribution
of
all
of
them
by
reason
of
his
authority
but
he
will
not
expend
or
make
use
of
a
larger
share
of
them
on
his
own
person
or
if
he
does
he
will
be
punished
his
share
will
exceed
that
of
some
and
be
less
than
that
of
others
and
if
he
be
the
weakest
of
all
he
being
the
best
of
all
will
have
the
smallest
share
of
all
callicles
am
i
not
right
my
friend
callicles
you
talk
about
meats
and
drinks
and
physicians
and
other
nonsense
i
am
not
speaking
of
them
socrates
well
but
do
you
admit
that
the
wiser
is
the
better
answer
or
callicles
yes
socrates
and
ought
not
the
better
to
have
a
larger
share
callicles
not
of
meats
and
drinks
socrates
i
understand
then
perhaps
of
coats
the
skilfullest
weaver
ought
to
have
the
largest
coat
and
the
greatest
number
of
them
and
go
about
clothed
in
the
best
and
finest
of
them
callicles
fudge
about
coats
socrates
then
the
skilfullest
and
best
in
making
shoes
ought
to
have
the
advantage
in
shoes
the
shoemaker
clearly
should
walk
about
in
the
largest
shoes
and
have
the
greatest
number
of
them
callicles
fudge
about
shoes
what
nonsense
are
you
talking
socrates
or
if
this
is
not
your
meaning
perhaps
you
would
say
that
the
wise
and
good
and
true
husbandman
should
actually
have
a
larger
share
of
seeds
and
have
as
much
seed
as
possible
for
his
own
land
callicles
how
you
go
on
always
talking
in
the
same
way
socrates
socrates
yes
callicles
and
also
about
the
same
things
callicles
yes
by
the
gods
you
are
literally
always
talking
of
cobblers
and
fullers
and
cooks
and
doctors
as
if
this
had
to
do
with
our
argument
socrates
but
why
will
you
not
tell
me
in
what
a
man
must
be
superior
and
wiser
in
order
to
claim
a
larger
share
will
you
neither
accept
a
suggestion
nor
offer
one
callicles
i
have
already
told
you
in
the
first
place
i
mean
by
superiors
not
cobblers
or
cooks
but
wise
politicians
who
understand
the
administration
of
a
state
and
who
are
not
only
wise
but
also
valiant
and
able
to
carry
out
their
designs
and
not
the
men
to
faint
from
want
of
soul
socrates
see
now
most
excellent
callicles
how
different
my
charge
against
you
is
from
that
which
you
bring
against
me
for
you
reproach
me
with
always
saying
the
same
but
i
reproach
you
with
never
saying
the
same
about
the
same
things
for
at
one
time
you
were
defining
the
better
and
the
superior
to
be
the
stronger
then
again
as
the
wiser
and
now
you
bring
forward
a
new
notion
the
superior
and
the
better
are
now
declared
by
you
to
be
the
more
courageous
i
wish
my
good
friend
that
you
would
tell
me
once
for
all
whom
you
affirm
to
be
the
better
and
superior
and
in
what
they
are
better
callicles
i
have
already
told
you
that
i
mean
those
who
are
wise
and
courageous
in
the
administration
of
a
state
they
ought
to
be
the
rulers
of
their
states
and
justice
consists
in
their
having
more
than
their
subjects
socrates
but
whether
rulers
or
subjects
will
they
or
will
they
not
have
more
than
themselves
my
friend
callicles
what
do
you
mean
socrates
i
mean
that
every
man
is
his
own
ruler
but
perhaps
you
think
that
there
is
no
necessity
for
him
to
rule
himself
he
is
only
required
to
rule
others
callicles
what
do
you
mean
by
his
over
himself
socrates
a
simple
thing
enough
just
what
is
commonly
said
that
a
man
should
be
temperate
and
master
of
himself
and
ruler
of
his
own
pleasures
and
passions
callicles
what
innocence
you
mean
those
fools
the
temperate
socrates
certainly
any
one
may
know
that
to
be
my
meaning
callicles
quite
so
socrates
and
they
are
really
fools
for
how
can
a
man
be
happy
who
is
the
servant
of
anything
on
the
contrary
i
plainly
assert
that
he
who
would
truly
live
ought
to
allow
his
desires
to
wax
to
the
uttermost
and
not
to
chastise
them
but
when
they
have
grown
to
their
greatest
he
should
have
courage
and
intelligence
to
minister
to
them
and
to
satisfy
all
his
longings
and
this
i
affirm
to
be
natural
justice
and
nobility
to
this
however
the
many
can
not
attain
and
they
blame
the
strong
man
because
they
are
ashamed
of
their
own
weakness
which
they
desire
to
conceal
and
hence
they
say
that
intemperance
is
base
as
i
have
remarked
already
they
enslave
the
nobler
natures
and
being
unable
to
satisfy
their
pleasures
they
praise
temperance
and
justice
out
of
their
own
cowardice
for
if
a
man
had
been
originally
the
son
of
a
king
or
had
a
nature
capable
of
acquiring
an
empire
or
a
tyranny
or
sovereignty
what
could
be
more
truly
base
or
evil
than
temperance
to
a
man
like
him
i
say
who
might
freely
be
enjoying
every
good
and
has
no
one
to
stand
in
his
way
and
yet
has
admitted
custom
and
reason
and
the
opinion
of
other
men
to
be
lords
over
him
must
not
he
be
in
a
miserable
plight
whom
the
reputation
of
justice
and
temperance
hinders
from
giving
more
to
his
friends
than
to
his
enemies
even
though
he
be
a
ruler
in
his
city
nay
socrates
for
you
profess
to
be
a
votary
of
the
truth
and
the
truth
is
this
that
luxury
and
intemperance
and
licence
if
they
be
provided
with
means
are
virtue
and
happiness
all
the
rest
is
a
mere
bauble
agreements
contrary
to
nature
foolish
talk
of
men
nothing
worth
compare
republic
socrates
there
is
a
noble
freedom
callicles
in
your
way
of
approaching
the
argument
for
what
you
say
is
what
the
rest
of
the
world
think
but
do
not
like
to
say
and
i
must
beg
of
you
to
persevere
that
the
true
rule
of
human
life
may
become
manifest
tell
me
then
you
say
do
you
not
that
in
the
man
the
passions
ought
not
to
be
controlled
but
that
we
should
let
them
grow
to
the
utmost
and
somehow
or
other
satisfy
them
and
that
this
is
virtue
callicles
yes
i
do
socrates
then
those
who
want
nothing
are
not
truly
said
to
be
happy
callicles
no
indeed
for
then
stones
and
dead
men
would
be
the
happiest
of
all
socrates
but
surely
life
according
to
your
view
is
an
awful
thing
and
indeed
i
think
that
euripides
may
have
been
right
in
saying
knows
if
life
be
not
death
and
death
life
and
that
we
are
very
likely
dead
i
have
heard
a
philosopher
say
that
at
this
moment
we
are
actually
dead
and
that
the
body
soma
is
our
tomb
sema
compare
phaedr
and
that
the
part
of
the
soul
which
is
the
seat
of
the
desires
is
liable
to
be
tossed
about
by
words
and
blown
up
and
down
and
some
ingenious
person
probably
a
sicilian
or
an
italian
playing
with
the
word
invented
a
tale
in
which
he
called
the
soul
because
of
its
believing
and
nature
a
vessel
an
untranslatable
pun
dia
to
pithanon
te
kai
pistikon
onomase
pithon
and
the
ignorant
he
called
the
uninitiated
or
leaky
and
the
place
in
the
souls
of
the
uninitiated
in
which
the
desires
are
seated
being
the
intemperate
and
incontinent
part
he
compared
to
a
vessel
full
of
holes
because
it
can
never
be
satisfied
he
is
not
of
your
way
of
thinking
callicles
for
he
declares
that
of
all
the
souls
in
hades
meaning
the
invisible
world
aeides
these
uninitiated
or
leaky
persons
are
the
most
miserable
and
that
they
pour
water
into
a
vessel
which
is
full
of
holes
out
of
a
colander
which
is
similarly
perforated
the
colander
as
my
informer
assures
me
is
the
soul
and
the
soul
which
he
compares
to
a
colander
is
the
soul
of
the
ignorant
which
is
likewise
full
of
holes
and
therefore
incontinent
owing
to
a
bad
memory
and
want
of
faith
these
notions
are
strange
enough
but
they
show
the
principle
which
if
i
can
i
would
fain
prove
to
you
that
you
should
change
your
mind
and
instead
of
the
intemperate
and
insatiate
life
choose
that
which
is
orderly
and
sufficient
and
has
a
due
provision
for
daily
needs
do
i
make
any
impression
on
you
and
are
you
coming
over
to
the
opinion
that
the
orderly
are
happier
than
the
intemperate
or
do
i
fail
to
persuade
you
and
however
many
tales
i
rehearse
to
you
do
you
continue
of
the
same
opinion
still
callicles
the
latter
socrates
is
more
like
the
truth
socrates
well
i
will
tell
you
another
image
which
comes
out
of
the
same
school
let
me
request
you
to
consider
how
far
you
would
accept
this
as
an
account
of
the
two
lives
of
the
temperate
and
intemperate
in
a
figure
there
are
two
men
both
of
whom
have
a
number
of
casks
the
one
man
has
his
casks
sound
and
full
one
of
wine
another
of
honey
and
a
third
of
milk
besides
others
filled
with
other
liquids
and
the
streams
which
fill
them
are
few
and
scanty
and
he
can
only
obtain
them
with
a
great
deal
of
toil
and
difficulty
but
when
his
casks
are
once
filled
he
has
no
need
to
feed
them
any
more
and
has
no
further
trouble
with
them
or
care
about
them
the
other
in
like
manner
can
procure
streams
though
not
without
difficulty
but
his
vessels
are
leaky
and
unsound
and
night
and
day
he
is
compelled
to
be
filling
them
and
if
he
pauses
for
a
moment
he
is
in
an
agony
of
pain
such
are
their
respective
lives
and
now
would
you
say
that
the
life
of
the
intemperate
is
happier
than
that
of
the
temperate
do
i
not
convince
you
that
the
opposite
is
the
truth
callicles
you
do
not
convince
me
socrates
for
the
one
who
has
filled
himself
has
no
longer
any
pleasure
left
and
this
as
i
was
just
now
saying
is
the
life
of
a
stone
he
has
neither
joy
nor
sorrow
after
he
is
once
filled
but
the
pleasure
depends
on
the
superabundance
of
the
influx
socrates
but
the
more
you
pour
in
the
greater
the
waste
and
the
holes
must
be
large
for
the
liquid
to
escape
callicles
certainly
socrates
the
life
which
you
are
now
depicting
is
not
that
of
a
dead
man
or
of
a
stone
but
of
a
cormorant
you
mean
that
he
is
to
be
hungering
and
eating
callicles
yes
socrates
and
he
is
to
be
thirsting
and
drinking
callicles
yes
that
is
what
i
mean
he
is
to
have
all
his
desires
about
him
and
to
be
able
to
live
happily
in
the
gratification
of
them
socrates
capital
excellent
go
on
as
you
have
begun
and
have
no
shame
i
too
must
disencumber
myself
of
shame
and
first
will
you
tell
me
whether
you
include
itching
and
scratching
provided
you
have
enough
of
them
and
pass
your
life
in
scratching
in
your
notion
of
happiness
callicles
what
a
strange
being
you
are
socrates
a
regular
socrates
that
was
the
reason
callicles
why
i
scared
polus
and
gorgias
until
they
were
too
modest
to
say
what
they
thought
but
you
will
not
be
too
modest
and
will
not
be
scared
for
you
are
a
brave
man
and
now
answer
my
question
callicles
i
answer
that
even
the
scratcher
would
live
pleasantly
socrates
and
if
pleasantly
then
also
happily
callicles
to
be
sure
socrates
but
what
if
the
itching
is
not
confined
to
the
head
shall
i
pursue
the
question
and
here
callicles
i
would
have
you
consider
how
you
would
reply
if
consequences
are
pressed
upon
you
especially
if
in
the
last
resort
you
are
asked
whether
the
life
of
a
catamite
is
not
terrible
foul
miserable
or
would
you
venture
to
say
that
they
too
are
happy
if
they
only
get
enough
of
what
they
want
callicles
are
you
not
ashamed
socrates
of
introducing
such
topics
into
the
argument
socrates
well
my
fine
friend
but
am
i
the
introducer
of
these
topics
or
he
who
says
without
any
qualification
that
all
who
feel
pleasure
in
whatever
manner
are
happy
and
who
admits
of
no
distinction
between
good
and
bad
pleasures
and
i
would
still
ask
whether
you
say
that
pleasure
and
good
are
the
same
or
whether
there
is
some
pleasure
which
is
not
a
good
callicles
well
then
for
the
sake
of
consistency
i
will
say
that
they
are
the
same
socrates
you
are
breaking
the
original
agreement
callicles
and
will
no
longer
be
a
satisfactory
companion
in
the
search
after
truth
if
you
say
what
is
contrary
to
your
real
opinion
callicles
why
that
is
what
you
are
doing
too
socrates
socrates
then
we
are
both
doing
wrong
still
my
dear
friend
i
would
ask
you
to
consider
whether
pleasure
from
whatever
source
derived
is
the
good
for
if
this
be
true
then
the
disagreeable
consequences
which
have
been
darkly
intimated
must
follow
and
many
others
callicles
that
socrates
is
only
your
opinion
socrates
and
do
you
callicles
seriously
maintain
what
you
are
saying
callicles
indeed
i
do
socrates
then
as
you
are
in
earnest
shall
we
proceed
with
the
argument
callicles
by
all
means
or
am
in
profound
earnest
socrates
well
if
you
are
willing
to
proceed
determine
this
question
for
me
there
is
something
i
presume
which
you
would
call
knowledge
callicles
there
is
socrates
and
were
you
not
saying
just
now
that
some
courage
implied
knowledge
callicles
i
was
socrates
and
you
were
speaking
of
courage
and
knowledge
as
two
things
different
from
one
another
callicles
certainly
i
was
socrates
and
would
you
say
that
pleasure
and
knowledge
are
the
same
or
not
the
same
callicles
not
the
same
o
man
of
wisdom
socrates
and
would
you
say
that
courage
differed
from
pleasure
callicles
certainly
socrates
well
then
let
us
remember
that
callicles
the
acharnian
says
that
pleasure
and
good
are
the
same
but
that
knowledge
and
courage
are
not
the
same
either
with
one
another
or
with
the
good
callicles
and
what
does
our
friend
socrates
of
foxton
say
does
he
assent
to
this
or
not
socrates
he
does
not
assent
neither
will
callicles
when
he
sees
himself
truly
you
will
admit
i
suppose
that
good
and
evil
fortune
are
opposed
to
each
other
callicles
yes
socrates
and
if
they
are
opposed
to
each
other
then
like
health
and
disease
they
exclude
one
another
a
man
can
not
have
them
both
or
be
without
them
both
at
the
same
time
callicles
what
do
you
mean
socrates
take
the
case
of
any
bodily
affection
a
man
may
have
the
complaint
in
his
eyes
which
is
called
ophthalmia
callicles
to
be
sure
socrates
but
he
surely
can
not
have
the
same
eyes
well
and
sound
at
the
same
time
callicles
certainly
not
socrates
and
when
he
has
got
rid
of
his
ophthalmia
has
he
got
rid
of
the
health
of
his
eyes
too
is
the
final
result
that
he
gets
rid
of
them
both
together
callicles
certainly
not
socrates
that
would
surely
be
marvellous
and
absurd
callicles
very
socrates
i
suppose
that
he
is
affected
by
them
and
gets
rid
of
them
in
turns
callicles
yes
socrates
and
he
may
have
strength
and
weakness
in
the
same
way
by
fits
callicles
yes
socrates
or
swiftness
and
slowness
callicles
certainly
socrates
and
does
he
have
and
not
have
good
and
happiness
and
their
opposites
evil
and
misery
in
a
similar
alternation
compare
republic
callicles
certainly
he
has
socrates
if
then
there
be
anything
which
a
man
has
and
has
not
at
the
same
time
clearly
that
can
not
be
good
and
evil
do
we
agree
please
not
to
answer
without
consideration
callicles
i
entirely
agree
socrates
go
back
now
to
our
former
did
you
say
that
to
hunger
i
mean
the
mere
state
of
hunger
was
pleasant
or
painful
callicles
i
said
painful
but
that
to
eat
when
you
are
hungry
is
pleasant
socrates
i
know
but
still
the
actual
hunger
is
painful
am
i
not
right
callicles
yes
socrates
and
thirst
too
is
painful
callicles
yes
very
socrates
need
i
adduce
any
more
instances
or
would
you
agree
that
all
wants
or
desires
are
painful
callicles
i
agree
and
therefore
you
need
not
adduce
any
more
instances
socrates
very
good
and
you
would
admit
that
to
drink
when
you
are
thirsty
is
pleasant
callicles
yes
socrates
and
in
the
sentence
which
you
have
just
uttered
the
word
implies
pain
callicles
yes
socrates
and
the
word
is
expressive
of
pleasure
and
of
the
satisfaction
of
the
want
callicles
yes
socrates
there
is
pleasure
in
drinking
callicles
certainly
socrates
when
you
are
thirsty
socrates
and
in
pain
callicles
yes
socrates
do
you
see
the
inference
that
pleasure
and
pain
are
simultaneous
when
you
say
that
being
thirsty
you
drink
for
are
they
not
simultaneous
and
do
they
not
affect
at
the
same
time
the
same
part
whether
of
the
soul
or
the
body
which
of
them
is
affected
can
not
be
supposed
to
be
of
any
consequence
is
not
this
true
callicles
it
is
socrates
you
said
also
that
no
man
could
have
good
and
evil
fortune
at
the
same
time
callicles
yes
i
did
socrates
but
you
admitted
that
when
in
pain
a
man
might
also
have
pleasure
callicles
clearly
socrates
then
pleasure
is
not
the
same
as
good
fortune
or
pain
the
same
as
evil
fortune
and
therefore
the
good
is
not
the
same
as
the
pleasant
callicles
i
wish
i
knew
socrates
what
your
quibbling
means
socrates
you
know
callicles
but
you
affect
not
to
know
callicles
well
get
on
and
do
keep
fooling
then
you
will
know
what
a
wiseacre
you
are
in
your
admonition
of
me
socrates
does
not
a
man
cease
from
his
thirst
and
from
his
pleasure
in
drinking
at
the
same
time
callicles
i
do
not
understand
what
you
are
saying
gorgias
nay
callicles
answer
if
only
for
our
sakes
we
should
like
to
hear
the
argument
out
callicles
yes
gorgias
but
i
must
complain
of
the
habitual
trifling
of
socrates
he
is
always
arguing
about
little
and
unworthy
questions
gorgias
what
matter
your
reputation
callicles
is
not
at
stake
let
socrates
argue
in
his
own
fashion
callicles
well
then
socrates
you
shall
ask
these
little
peddling
questions
since
gorgias
wishes
to
have
them
socrates
i
envy
you
callicles
for
having
been
initiated
into
the
great
mysteries
before
you
were
initiated
into
the
lesser
i
thought
that
this
was
not
allowable
but
to
return
to
our
argument
does
not
a
man
cease
from
thirsting
and
from
the
pleasure
of
drinking
at
the
same
moment
callicles
true
socrates
and
if
he
is
hungry
or
has
any
other
desire
does
he
not
cease
from
the
desire
and
the
pleasure
at
the
same
moment
callicles
very
true
socrates
then
he
ceases
from
pain
and
pleasure
at
the
same
moment
callicles
yes
socrates
but
he
does
not
cease
from
good
and
evil
at
the
same
moment
as
you
have
admitted
do
you
still
adhere
to
what
you
said
callicles
yes
i
do
but
what
is
the
inference
socrates
why
my
friend
the
inference
is
that
the
good
is
not
the
same
as
the
pleasant
or
the
evil
the
same
as
the
painful
there
is
a
cessation
of
pleasure
and
pain
at
the
same
moment
but
not
of
good
and
evil
for
they
are
different
how
then
can
pleasure
be
the
same
as
good
or
pain
as
evil
and
i
would
have
you
look
at
the
matter
in
another
light
which
could
hardly
i
think
have
been
considered
by
you
when
you
identified
them
are
not
the
good
good
because
they
have
good
present
with
them
as
the
beautiful
are
those
who
have
beauty
present
with
them
callicles
yes
socrates
and
do
you
call
the
fools
and
cowards
good
men
for
you
were
saying
just
now
that
the
courageous
and
the
wise
are
the
good
would
you
not
say
so
callicles
certainly
socrates
and
did
you
never
see
a
foolish
child
rejoicing
callicles
yes
i
have
socrates
and
a
foolish
man
too
callicles
yes
certainly
but
what
is
your
drift
socrates
nothing
particular
if
you
will
only
answer
callicles
yes
i
have
socrates
and
did
you
ever
see
a
sensible
man
rejoicing
or
sorrowing
callicles
yes
socrates
which
rejoice
and
sorrow
most
the
wise
or
the
foolish
callicles
they
are
much
upon
a
par
i
think
in
that
respect
socrates
enough
and
did
you
ever
see
a
coward
in
battle
callicles
to
be
sure
socrates
and
which
rejoiced
most
at
the
departure
of
the
enemy
the
coward
or
the
brave
callicles
i
should
say
of
both
or
at
any
rate
they
rejoiced
about
equally
socrates
no
matter
then
the
cowards
and
not
only
the
brave
rejoice
callicles
greatly
socrates
and
the
foolish
so
it
would
seem
callicles
yes
socrates
and
are
only
the
cowards
pained
at
the
approach
of
their
enemies
or
are
the
brave
also
pained
callicles
both
are
pained
socrates
and
are
they
equally
pained
callicles
i
should
imagine
that
the
cowards
are
more
pained
socrates
and
are
they
not
better
pleased
at
the
enemy
departure
callicles
i
dare
say
socrates
then
are
the
foolish
and
the
wise
and
the
cowards
and
the
brave
all
pleased
and
pained
as
you
were
saying
in
nearly
equal
degree
but
are
the
cowards
more
pleased
and
pained
than
the
brave
callicles
yes
socrates
but
surely
the
wise
and
brave
are
the
good
and
the
foolish
and
the
cowardly
are
the
bad
callicles
yes
socrates
then
the
good
and
the
bad
are
pleased
and
pained
in
a
nearly
equal
degree
callicles
yes
socrates
then
are
the
good
and
bad
good
and
bad
in
a
nearly
equal
degree
or
have
the
bad
the
advantage
both
in
good
and
evil
in
having
more
pleasure
and
more
pain
callicles
i
really
do
not
know
what
you
mean
socrates
why
do
you
not
remember
saying
that
the
good
were
good
because
good
was
present
with
them
and
the
evil
because
evil
and
that
pleasures
were
goods
and
pains
evils
callicles
yes
i
remember
socrates
and
are
not
these
pleasures
or
goods
present
to
those
who
rejoice
if
they
do
rejoice
callicles
certainly
socrates
then
those
who
rejoice
are
good
when
goods
are
present
with
them
callicles
yes
socrates
and
those
who
are
in
pain
have
evil
or
sorrow
present
with
them
callicles
yes
socrates
and
would
you
still
say
that
the
evil
are
evil
by
reason
of
the
presence
of
evil
callicles
i
should
socrates
then
those
who
rejoice
are
good
and
those
who
are
in
pain
evil
callicles
yes
socrates
the
degrees
of
good
and
evil
vary
with
the
degrees
of
pleasure
and
of
pain
callicles
yes
socrates
have
the
wise
man
and
the
fool
the
brave
and
the
coward
joy
and
pain
in
nearly
equal
degrees
or
would
you
say
that
the
coward
has
more
callicles
i
should
say
that
he
has
socrates
help
me
then
to
draw
out
the
conclusion
which
follows
from
our
admissions
for
it
is
good
to
repeat
and
review
what
is
good
twice
and
thrice
over
as
they
say
both
the
wise
man
and
the
brave
man
we
allow
to
be
good
callicles
yes
socrates
and
the
foolish
man
and
the
coward
to
be
evil
callicles
certainly
socrates
and
he
who
has
joy
is
good
callicles
yes
socrates
and
he
who
is
in
pain
is
evil
callicles
certainly
socrates
the
good
and
evil
both
have
joy
and
pain
but
perhaps
the
evil
has
more
of
them
callicles
yes
socrates
then
must
we
not
infer
that
the
bad
man
is
as
good
and
bad
as
the
good
or
perhaps
even
better
is
not
this
a
further
inference
which
follows
equally
with
the
preceding
from
the
assertion
that
the
good
and
the
pleasant
are
the
same
can
this
be
denied
callicles
callicles
i
have
been
listening
and
making
admissions
to
you
socrates
and
i
remark
that
if
a
person
grants
you
anything
in
play
you
like
a
child
want
to
keep
hold
and
will
not
give
it
back
but
do
you
really
suppose
that
i
or
any
other
human
being
denies
that
some
pleasures
are
good
and
others
bad
socrates
alas
callicles
how
unfair
you
are
you
certainly
treat
me
as
if
i
were
a
child
sometimes
saying
one
thing
and
then
another
as
if
you
were
meaning
to
deceive
me
and
yet
i
thought
at
first
that
you
were
my
friend
and
would
not
have
deceived
me
if
you
could
have
helped
but
i
see
that
i
was
mistaken
and
now
i
suppose
that
i
must
make
the
best
of
a
bad
business
as
they
said
of
old
and
take
what
i
can
get
out
of
well
then
as
i
understand
you
to
say
i
may
assume
that
some
pleasures
are
good
and
others
evil
callicles
yes
socrates
the
beneficial
are
good
and
the
hurtful
are
evil
callicles
to
be
sure
socrates
and
the
beneficial
are
those
which
do
some
good
and
the
hurtful
are
those
which
do
some
evil
callicles
yes
socrates
take
for
example
the
bodily
pleasures
of
eating
and
drinking
which
we
were
just
now
mentioning
you
mean
to
say
that
those
which
promote
health
or
any
other
bodily
excellence
are
good
and
their
opposites
evil
callicles
certainly
socrates
and
in
the
same
way
there
are
good
pains
and
there
are
evil
pains
callicles
to
be
sure
socrates
and
ought
we
not
to
choose
and
use
the
good
pleasures
and
pains
callicles
certainly
socrates
but
not
the
evil
callicles
clearly
socrates
because
if
you
remember
polus
and
i
have
agreed
that
all
our
actions
are
to
be
done
for
the
sake
of
the
good
and
will
you
agree
with
us
in
saying
that
the
good
is
the
end
of
all
our
actions
and
that
all
our
actions
are
to
be
done
for
the
sake
of
the
good
and
not
the
good
for
the
sake
of
them
will
you
add
a
third
vote
to
our
two
callicles
i
will
socrates
then
pleasure
like
everything
else
is
to
be
sought
for
the
sake
of
that
which
is
good
and
not
that
which
is
good
for
the
sake
of
pleasure
callicles
to
be
sure
socrates
but
can
every
man
choose
what
pleasures
are
good
and
what
are
evil
or
must
he
have
art
or
knowledge
of
them
in
detail
callicles
he
must
have
art
socrates
let
me
now
remind
you
of
what
i
was
saying
to
gorgias
and
polus
i
was
saying
as
you
will
not
have
forgotten
that
there
were
some
processes
which
aim
only
at
pleasure
and
know
nothing
of
a
better
and
worse
and
there
are
other
processes
which
know
good
and
evil
and
i
considered
that
cookery
which
i
do
not
call
an
art
but
only
an
experience
was
of
the
former
class
which
is
concerned
with
pleasure
and
that
the
art
of
medicine
was
of
the
class
which
is
concerned
with
the
good
and
now
by
the
god
of
friendship
i
must
beg
you
callicles
not
to
jest
or
to
imagine
that
i
am
jesting
with
you
do
not
answer
at
random
and
contrary
to
your
real
opinion
for
you
will
observe
that
we
are
arguing
about
the
way
of
human
life
and
to
a
man
who
has
any
sense
at
all
what
question
can
be
more
serious
than
this
whether
he
should
follow
after
that
way
of
life
to
which
you
exhort
me
and
act
what
you
call
the
manly
part
of
speaking
in
the
assembly
and
cultivating
rhetoric
and
engaging
in
public
affairs
according
to
the
principles
now
in
vogue
or
whether
he
should
pursue
the
life
of
philosophy
and
in
what
the
latter
way
differs
from
the
former
but
perhaps
we
had
better
first
try
to
distinguish
them
as
i
did
before
and
when
we
have
come
to
an
agreement
that
they
are
distinct
we
may
proceed
to
consider
in
what
they
differ
from
one
another
and
which
of
them
we
should
choose
perhaps
however
you
do
not
even
now
understand
what
i
mean
callicles
no
i
do
not
socrates
then
i
will
explain
myself
more
clearly
seeing
that
you
and
i
have
agreed
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
good
and
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
pleasure
and
that
pleasure
is
not
the
same
as
good
and
that
the
pursuit
and
process
of
acquisition
of
the
one
that
is
pleasure
is
different
from
the
pursuit
and
process
of
acquisition
of
the
other
which
is
good
i
wish
that
you
would
tell
me
whether
you
agree
with
me
thus
far
or
not
do
you
agree
callicles
i
do
socrates
then
i
will
proceed
and
ask
whether
you
also
agree
with
me
and
whether
you
think
that
i
spoke
the
truth
when
i
further
said
to
gorgias
and
polus
that
cookery
in
my
opinion
is
only
an
experience
and
not
an
art
at
all
and
that
whereas
medicine
is
an
art
and
attends
to
the
nature
and
constitution
of
the
patient
and
has
principles
of
action
and
reason
in
each
case
cookery
in
attending
upon
pleasure
never
regards
either
the
nature
or
reason
of
that
pleasure
to
which
she
devotes
herself
but
goes
straight
to
her
end
nor
ever
considers
or
calculates
anything
but
works
by
experience
and
routine
and
just
preserves
the
recollection
of
what
she
has
usually
done
when
producing
pleasure
and
first
i
would
have
you
consider
whether
i
have
proved
what
i
was
saying
and
then
whether
there
are
not
other
similar
processes
which
have
to
do
with
the
soul
some
of
them
processes
of
art
making
a
provision
for
the
soul
highest
interest
others
despising
the
interest
and
as
in
the
previous
case
considering
only
the
pleasure
of
the
soul
and
how
this
may
be
acquired
but
not
considering
what
pleasures
are
good
or
bad
and
having
no
other
aim
but
to
afford
gratification
whether
good
or
bad
in
my
opinion
callicles
there
are
such
processes
and
this
is
the
sort
of
thing
which
i
term
flattery
whether
concerned
with
the
body
or
the
soul
or
whenever
employed
with
a
view
to
pleasure
and
without
any
consideration
of
good
and
evil
and
now
i
wish
that
you
would
tell
me
whether
you
agree
with
us
in
this
notion
or
whether
you
differ
callicles
i
do
not
differ
on
the
contrary
i
agree
for
in
that
way
i
shall
soonest
bring
the
argument
to
an
end
and
shall
oblige
my
friend
gorgias
socrates
and
is
this
notion
true
of
one
soul
or
of
two
or
more
callicles
equally
true
of
two
or
more
socrates
then
a
man
may
delight
a
whole
assembly
and
yet
have
no
regard
for
their
true
interests
callicles
yes
socrates
can
you
tell
me
the
pursuits
which
delight
mankind
or
rather
if
you
would
prefer
let
me
ask
and
do
you
answer
which
of
them
belong
to
the
pleasurable
class
and
which
of
them
not
in
the
first
place
what
say
you
of
does
not
that
appear
to
be
an
art
which
seeks
only
pleasure
callicles
and
thinks
of
nothing
else
callicles
i
assent
socrates
and
is
not
the
same
true
of
all
similar
arts
as
for
example
the
art
of
playing
the
lyre
at
festivals
callicles
yes
socrates
and
what
do
you
say
of
the
choral
art
and
of
dithyrambic
poetry
are
not
they
of
the
same
nature
do
you
imagine
that
cinesias
the
son
of
meles
cares
about
what
will
tend
to
the
moral
improvement
of
his
hearers
or
about
what
will
give
pleasure
to
the
multitude
callicles
there
can
be
no
mistake
about
cinesias
socrates
socrates
and
what
do
you
say
of
his
father
meles
the
did
he
perform
with
any
view
to
the
good
of
his
hearers
could
he
be
said
to
regard
even
their
pleasure
for
his
singing
was
an
infliction
to
his
audience
and
of
and
dithyrambic
poetry
in
general
what
would
you
say
have
they
not
been
invented
wholly
for
the
sake
of
pleasure
callicles
that
is
my
notion
of
them
socrates
and
as
for
the
muse
of
tragedy
that
solemn
and
august
personage
what
are
her
aspirations
is
all
her
aim
and
desire
only
to
give
pleasure
to
the
spectators
or
does
she
fight
against
them
and
refuse
to
speak
of
their
pleasant
vices
and
willingly
proclaim
in
word
and
song
truths
welcome
and
unwelcome
which
in
your
judgment
is
her
character
callicles
there
can
be
no
doubt
socrates
that
tragedy
has
her
face
turned
towards
pleasure
and
the
gratification
of
the
audience
socrates
and
is
not
that
the
sort
of
thing
callicles
which
we
were
just
now
describing
as
flattery
callicles
quite
true
socrates
well
now
suppose
that
we
strip
all
poetry
of
song
and
rhythm
and
metre
there
will
remain
speech
compare
republic
callicles
to
be
sure
socrates
and
this
speech
is
addressed
to
a
crowd
of
people
callicles
yes
socrates
then
poetry
is
a
sort
of
rhetoric
callicles
true
socrates
and
do
not
the
poets
in
the
theatres
seem
to
you
to
be
rhetoricians
callicles
yes
socrates
then
now
we
have
discovered
a
sort
of
rhetoric
which
is
addressed
to
a
crowd
of
men
women
and
children
freemen
and
slaves
and
this
is
not
much
to
our
taste
for
we
have
described
it
as
having
the
nature
of
flattery
callicles
quite
true
socrates
very
good
and
what
do
you
say
of
that
other
rhetoric
which
addresses
the
athenian
assembly
and
the
assemblies
of
freemen
in
other
states
do
the
rhetoricians
appear
to
you
always
to
aim
at
what
is
best
and
do
they
seek
to
improve
the
citizens
by
their
speeches
or
are
they
too
like
the
rest
of
mankind
bent
upon
giving
them
pleasure
forgetting
the
public
good
in
the
thought
of
their
own
interest
playing
with
the
people
as
with
children
and
trying
to
amuse
them
but
never
considering
whether
they
are
better
or
worse
for
this
callicles
i
must
distinguish
there
are
some
who
have
a
real
care
of
the
public
in
what
they
say
while
others
are
such
as
you
describe
socrates
i
am
contented
with
the
admission
that
rhetoric
is
of
two
sorts
one
which
is
mere
flattery
and
disgraceful
declamation
the
other
which
is
noble
and
aims
at
the
training
and
improvement
of
the
souls
of
the
citizens
and
strives
to
say
what
is
best
whether
welcome
or
unwelcome
to
the
audience
but
have
you
ever
known
such
a
rhetoric
or
if
you
have
and
can
point
out
any
rhetorician
who
is
of
this
stamp
who
is
he
callicles
but
indeed
i
am
afraid
that
i
can
not
tell
you
of
any
such
among
the
orators
who
are
at
present
living
socrates
well
then
can
you
mention
any
one
of
a
former
generation
who
may
be
said
to
have
improved
the
athenians
who
found
them
worse
and
made
them
better
from
the
day
that
he
began
to
make
speeches
for
indeed
i
do
not
know
of
such
a
man
callicles
what
did
you
never
hear
that
themistocles
was
a
good
man
and
cimon
and
miltiades
and
pericles
who
is
just
lately
dead
and
whom
you
heard
yourself
socrates
yes
callicles
they
were
good
men
if
as
you
said
at
first
true
virtue
consists
only
in
the
satisfaction
of
our
own
desires
and
those
of
others
but
if
not
and
if
as
we
were
afterwards
compelled
to
acknowledge
the
satisfaction
of
some
desires
makes
us
better
and
of
others
worse
and
we
ought
to
gratify
the
one
and
not
the
other
and
there
is
an
art
in
distinguishing
them
can
you
tell
me
of
any
of
these
statesmen
who
did
distinguish
them
callicles
no
indeed
i
can
not
socrates
yet
surely
callicles
if
you
look
you
will
find
such
a
one
suppose
that
we
just
calmly
consider
whether
any
of
these
was
such
as
i
have
described
will
not
the
good
man
who
says
whatever
he
says
with
a
view
to
the
best
speak
with
a
reference
to
some
standard
and
not
at
random
just
as
all
other
artists
whether
the
painter
the
builder
the
shipwright
or
any
other
look
all
of
them
to
their
own
work
and
do
not
select
and
apply
at
random
what
they
apply
but
strive
to
give
a
definite
form
to
it
the
artist
disposes
all
things
in
order
and
compels
the
one
part
to
harmonize
and
accord
with
the
other
part
until
he
has
constructed
a
regular
and
systematic
whole
and
this
is
true
of
all
artists
and
in
the
same
way
the
trainers
and
physicians
of
whom
we
spoke
before
give
order
and
regularity
to
the
body
do
you
deny
this
callicles
no
i
am
ready
to
admit
it
socrates
then
the
house
in
which
order
and
regularity
prevail
is
good
that
in
which
there
is
disorder
evil
callicles
yes
socrates
and
the
same
is
true
of
a
ship
callicles
yes
socrates
and
the
same
may
be
said
of
the
human
body
callicles
yes
socrates
and
what
would
you
say
of
the
soul
will
the
good
soul
be
that
in
which
disorder
is
prevalent
or
that
in
which
there
is
harmony
and
order
callicles
the
latter
follows
from
our
previous
admissions
socrates
what
is
the
name
which
is
given
to
the
effect
of
harmony
and
order
in
the
body
callicles
i
suppose
that
you
mean
health
and
strength
socrates
yes
i
do
and
what
is
the
name
which
you
would
give
to
the
effect
of
harmony
and
order
in
the
soul
try
and
discover
a
name
for
this
as
well
as
for
the
other
callicles
why
not
give
the
name
yourself
socrates
socrates
well
if
you
had
rather
that
i
should
i
will
and
you
shall
say
whether
you
agree
with
me
and
if
not
you
shall
refute
and
answer
me
as
i
conceive
is
the
name
which
is
given
to
the
regular
order
of
the
body
whence
comes
health
and
every
other
bodily
excellence
is
that
true
or
not
callicles
true
socrates
and
and
are
the
names
which
are
given
to
the
regular
order
and
action
of
the
soul
and
these
make
men
lawful
and
orderly
and
so
we
have
temperance
and
justice
have
we
not
callicles
granted
socrates
and
will
not
the
true
rhetorician
who
is
honest
and
understands
his
art
have
his
eye
fixed
upon
these
in
all
the
words
which
he
addresses
to
the
souls
of
men
and
in
all
his
actions
both
in
what
he
gives
and
in
what
he
takes
away
will
not
his
aim
be
to
implant
justice
in
the
souls
of
his
citizens
and
take
away
injustice
to
implant
temperance
and
take
away
intemperance
to
implant
every
virtue
and
take
away
every
vice
do
you
not
agree
callicles
i
agree
socrates
for
what
use
is
there
callicles
in
giving
to
the
body
of
a
sick
man
who
is
in
a
bad
state
of
health
a
quantity
of
the
most
delightful
food
or
drink
or
any
other
pleasant
thing
which
may
be
really
as
bad
for
him
as
if
you
gave
him
nothing
or
even
worse
if
rightly
estimated
is
not
that
true
callicles
i
will
not
say
no
to
it
socrates
for
in
my
opinion
there
is
no
profit
in
a
man
life
if
his
body
is
in
an
evil
plight
in
that
case
his
life
also
is
evil
am
i
not
right
callicles
yes
socrates
when
a
man
is
in
health
the
physicians
will
generally
allow
him
to
eat
when
he
is
hungry
and
drink
when
he
is
thirsty
and
to
satisfy
his
desires
as
he
likes
but
when
he
is
sick
they
hardly
suffer
him
to
satisfy
his
desires
at
all
even
you
will
admit
that
callicles
yes
socrates
and
does
not
the
same
argument
hold
of
the
soul
my
good
sir
while
she
is
in
a
bad
state
and
is
senseless
and
intemperate
and
unjust
and
unholy
her
desires
ought
to
be
controlled
and
she
ought
to
be
prevented
from
doing
anything
which
does
not
tend
to
her
own
improvement
callicles
yes
socrates
such
treatment
will
be
better
for
the
soul
herself
callicles
to
be
sure
socrates
and
to
restrain
her
from
her
appetites
is
to
chastise
her
callicles
yes
socrates
then
restraint
or
chastisement
is
better
for
the
soul
than
intemperance
or
the
absence
of
control
which
you
were
just
now
preferring
callicles
i
do
not
understand
you
socrates
and
i
wish
that
you
would
ask
some
one
who
does
socrates
here
is
a
gentleman
who
can
not
endure
to
be
improved
or
to
subject
himself
to
that
very
chastisement
of
which
the
argument
speaks
callicles
i
do
not
heed
a
word
of
what
you
are
saying
and
have
only
answered
hitherto
out
of
civility
to
gorgias
socrates
what
are
we
to
do
then
shall
we
break
off
in
the
middle
callicles
you
shall
judge
for
yourself
socrates
well
but
people
say
that
tale
should
have
a
head
and
not
break
off
in
the
middle
and
i
should
not
like
to
have
the
argument
going
about
without
a
head
compare
laws
please
then
to
go
on
a
little
longer
and
put
the
head
on
callicles
how
tyrannical
you
are
socrates
i
wish
that
you
and
your
argument
would
rest
or
that
you
would
get
some
one
else
to
argue
with
you
socrates
but
who
else
is
willing
i
want
to
finish
the
argument
callicles
can
not
you
finish
without
my
help
either
talking
straight
on
or
questioning
and
answering
yourself
socrates
must
i
then
say
with
epicharmus
men
spoke
before
but
now
one
shall
be
enough
i
suppose
that
there
is
absolutely
no
help
and
if
i
am
to
carry
on
the
enquiry
by
myself
i
will
first
of
all
remark
that
not
only
i
but
all
of
us
should
have
an
ambition
to
know
what
is
true
and
what
is
false
in
this
matter
for
the
discovery
of
the
truth
is
a
common
good
and
now
i
will
proceed
to
argue
according
to
my
own
notion
but
if
any
of
you
think
that
i
arrive
at
conclusions
which
are
untrue
you
must
interpose
and
refute
me
for
i
do
not
speak
from
any
knowledge
of
what
i
am
saying
i
am
an
enquirer
like
yourselves
and
therefore
if
my
opponent
says
anything
which
is
of
force
i
shall
be
the
first
to
agree
with
him
i
am
speaking
on
the
supposition
that
the
argument
ought
to
be
completed
but
if
you
think
otherwise
let
us
leave
off
and
go
our
ways
gorgias
i
think
socrates
that
we
should
not
go
our
ways
until
you
have
completed
the
argument
and
this
appears
to
me
to
be
the
wish
of
the
rest
of
the
company
i
myself
should
very
much
like
to
hear
what
more
you
have
to
say
socrates
i
too
gorgias
should
have
liked
to
continue
the
argument
with
callicles
and
then
i
might
have
given
him
an
in
return
for
his
but
since
you
callicles
are
unwilling
to
continue
i
hope
that
you
will
listen
and
interrupt
me
if
i
seem
to
you
to
be
in
error
and
if
you
refute
me
i
shall
not
be
angry
with
you
as
you
are
with
me
but
i
shall
inscribe
you
as
the
greatest
of
benefactors
on
the
tablets
of
my
soul
callicles
my
good
fellow
never
mind
me
but
get
on
socrates
listen
to
me
then
while
i
recapitulate
the
argument
is
the
pleasant
the
same
as
the
good
not
the
same
callicles
and
i
are
agreed
about
that
and
is
the
pleasant
to
be
pursued
for
the
sake
of
the
good
or
the
good
for
the
sake
of
the
pleasant
the
pleasant
is
to
be
pursued
for
the
sake
of
the
good
and
that
is
pleasant
at
the
presence
of
which
we
are
pleased
and
that
is
good
at
the
presence
of
which
we
are
good
to
be
sure
and
we
are
good
and
all
good
things
whatever
are
good
when
some
virtue
is
present
in
us
or
them
that
callicles
is
my
conviction
but
the
virtue
of
each
thing
whether
body
or
soul
instrument
or
creature
when
given
to
them
in
the
best
way
comes
to
them
not
by
chance
but
as
the
result
of
the
order
and
truth
and
art
which
are
imparted
to
them
am
i
not
right
i
maintain
that
i
am
and
is
not
the
virtue
of
each
thing
dependent
on
order
or
arrangement
yes
i
say
and
that
which
makes
a
thing
good
is
the
proper
order
inhering
in
each
thing
such
is
my
view
and
is
not
the
soul
which
has
an
order
of
her
own
better
than
that
which
has
no
order
certainly
and
the
soul
which
has
order
is
orderly
of
course
and
that
which
is
orderly
is
temperate
assuredly
and
the
temperate
soul
is
good
no
other
answer
can
i
give
callicles
dear
have
you
any
callicles
go
on
my
good
fellow
socrates
then
i
shall
proceed
to
add
that
if
the
temperate
soul
is
the
good
soul
the
soul
which
is
in
the
opposite
condition
that
is
the
foolish
and
intemperate
is
the
bad
soul
very
true
and
will
not
the
temperate
man
do
what
is
proper
both
in
relation
to
the
gods
and
to
men
for
he
would
not
be
temperate
if
he
did
not
certainly
he
will
do
what
is
proper
in
his
relation
to
other
men
he
will
do
what
is
just
and
in
his
relation
to
the
gods
he
will
do
what
is
holy
and
he
who
does
what
is
just
and
holy
must
be
just
and
holy
very
true
and
must
he
not
be
courageous
for
the
duty
of
a
temperate
man
is
not
to
follow
or
to
avoid
what
he
ought
not
but
what
he
ought
whether
things
or
men
or
pleasures
or
pains
and
patiently
to
endure
when
he
ought
and
therefore
callicles
the
temperate
man
being
as
we
have
described
also
just
and
courageous
and
holy
can
not
be
other
than
a
perfectly
good
man
nor
can
the
good
man
do
otherwise
than
well
and
perfectly
whatever
he
does
and
he
who
does
well
must
of
necessity
be
happy
and
blessed
and
the
evil
man
who
does
evil
miserable
now
this
latter
is
he
whom
you
were
applauding
the
intemperate
who
is
the
opposite
of
the
temperate
such
is
my
position
and
these
things
i
affirm
to
be
true
and
if
they
are
true
then
i
further
affirm
that
he
who
desires
to
be
happy
must
pursue
and
practise
temperance
and
run
away
from
intemperance
as
fast
as
his
legs
will
carry
him
he
had
better
order
his
life
so
as
not
to
need
punishment
but
if
either
he
or
any
of
his
friends
whether
private
individual
or
city
are
in
need
of
punishment
then
justice
must
be
done
and
he
must
suffer
punishment
if
he
would
be
happy
this
appears
to
me
to
be
the
aim
which
a
man
ought
to
have
and
towards
which
he
ought
to
direct
all
the
energies
both
of
himself
and
of
the
state
acting
so
that
he
may
have
temperance
and
justice
present
with
him
and
be
happy
not
suffering
his
lusts
to
be
unrestrained
and
in
the
desire
satisfy
them
leading
a
robber
life
such
a
one
is
the
friend
neither
of
god
nor
man
for
he
is
incapable
of
communion
and
he
who
is
incapable
of
communion
is
also
incapable
of
friendship
and
philosophers
tell
us
callicles
that
communion
and
friendship
and
orderliness
and
temperance
and
justice
bind
together
heaven
and
earth
and
gods
and
men
and
that
this
universe
is
therefore
called
cosmos
or
order
not
disorder
or
misrule
my
friend
but
although
you
are
a
philosopher
you
seem
to
me
never
to
have
observed
that
geometrical
equality
is
mighty
both
among
gods
and
men
you
think
that
you
ought
to
cultivate
inequality
or
excess
and
do
not
care
about
well
then
either
the
principle
that
the
happy
are
made
happy
by
the
possession
of
justice
and
temperance
and
the
miserable
miserable
by
the
possession
of
vice
must
be
refuted
or
if
it
is
granted
what
will
be
the
consequences
all
the
consequences
which
i
drew
before
callicles
and
about
which
you
asked
me
whether
i
was
in
earnest
when
i
said
that
a
man
ought
to
accuse
himself
and
his
son
and
his
friend
if
he
did
anything
wrong
and
that
to
this
end
he
should
use
his
rhetoric
all
those
consequences
are
true
and
that
which
you
thought
that
polus
was
led
to
admit
out
of
modesty
is
true
that
to
do
injustice
if
more
disgraceful
than
to
suffer
is
in
that
degree
worse
and
the
other
position
which
according
to
polus
gorgias
admitted
out
of
modesty
that
he
who
would
truly
be
a
rhetorician
ought
to
be
just
and
have
a
knowledge
of
justice
has
also
turned
out
to
be
true
and
now
these
things
being
as
we
have
said
let
us
proceed
in
the
next
place
to
consider
whether
you
are
right
in
throwing
in
my
teeth
that
i
am
unable
to
help
myself
or
any
of
my
friends
or
kinsmen
or
to
save
them
in
the
extremity
of
danger
and
that
i
am
in
the
power
of
another
like
an
outlaw
to
whom
any
one
may
do
what
he
likes
he
may
box
my
ears
which
was
a
brave
saying
of
yours
or
take
away
my
goods
or
banish
me
or
even
do
his
worst
and
kill
me
a
condition
which
as
you
say
is
the
height
of
disgrace
my
answer
to
you
is
one
which
has
been
already
often
repeated
but
may
as
well
be
repeated
once
more
i
tell
you
callicles
that
to
be
boxed
on
the
ears
wrongfully
is
not
the
worst
evil
which
can
befall
a
man
nor
to
have
my
purse
or
my
body
cut
open
but
that
to
smite
and
slay
me
and
mine
wrongfully
is
far
more
disgraceful
and
more
evil
aye
and
to
despoil
and
enslave
and
pillage
or
in
any
way
at
all
to
wrong
me
and
mine
is
far
more
disgraceful
and
evil
to
the
doer
of
the
wrong
than
to
me
who
am
the
sufferer
these
truths
which
have
been
already
set
forth
as
i
state
them
in
the
previous
discussion
would
seem
now
to
have
been
fixed
and
riveted
by
us
if
i
may
use
an
expression
which
is
certainly
bold
in
words
which
are
like
bonds
of
iron
and
adamant
and
unless
you
or
some
other
still
more
enterprising
hero
shall
break
them
there
is
no
possibility
of
denying
what
i
say
for
my
position
has
always
been
that
i
myself
am
ignorant
how
these
things
are
but
that
i
have
never
met
any
one
who
could
say
otherwise
any
more
than
you
can
and
not
appear
ridiculous
this
is
my
position
still
and
if
what
i
am
saying
is
true
and
injustice
is
the
greatest
of
evils
to
the
doer
of
injustice
and
yet
there
is
if
possible
a
greater
than
this
greatest
of
evils
compare
republic
in
an
unjust
man
not
suffering
retribution
what
is
that
defence
of
which
the
want
will
make
a
man
truly
ridiculous
must
not
the
defence
be
one
which
will
avert
the
greatest
of
human
evils
and
will
not
the
worst
of
all
defences
be
that
with
which
a
man
is
unable
to
defend
himself
or
his
family
or
his
friends
and
next
will
come
that
which
is
unable
to
avert
the
next
greatest
evil
thirdly
that
which
is
unable
to
avert
the
third
greatest
evil
and
so
of
other
evils
as
is
the
greatness
of
evil
so
is
the
honour
of
being
able
to
avert
them
in
their
several
degrees
and
the
disgrace
of
not
being
able
to
avert
them
am
i
not
right
callicles
callicles
yes
quite
right
socrates
seeing
then
that
there
are
these
two
evils
the
doing
injustice
and
the
suffering
injustice
and
we
affirm
that
to
do
injustice
is
a
greater
and
to
suffer
injustice
a
lesser
evil
by
what
devices
can
a
man
succeed
in
obtaining
the
two
advantages
the
one
of
not
doing
and
the
other
of
not
suffering
injustice
must
he
have
the
power
or
only
the
will
to
obtain
them
i
mean
to
ask
whether
a
man
will
escape
injustice
if
he
has
only
the
will
to
escape
or
must
he
have
provided
himself
with
the
power
callicles
he
must
have
provided
himself
with
the
power
that
is
clear
socrates
and
what
do
you
say
of
doing
injustice
is
the
will
only
sufficient
and
will
that
prevent
him
from
doing
injustice
or
must
he
have
provided
himself
with
power
and
art
and
if
he
have
not
studied
and
practised
will
he
be
unjust
still
surely
you
might
say
callicles
whether
you
think
that
polus
and
i
were
right
in
admitting
the
conclusion
that
no
one
does
wrong
voluntarily
but
that
all
do
wrong
against
their
will
callicles
granted
socrates
if
you
will
only
have
done
socrates
then
as
would
appear
power
and
art
have
to
be
provided
in
order
that
we
may
do
no
injustice
callicles
certainly
socrates
and
what
art
will
protect
us
from
suffering
injustice
if
not
wholly
yet
as
far
as
possible
i
want
to
know
whether
you
agree
with
me
for
i
think
that
such
an
art
is
the
art
of
one
who
is
either
a
ruler
or
even
tyrant
himself
or
the
equal
and
companion
of
the
ruling
power
callicles
well
said
socrates
and
please
to
observe
how
ready
i
am
to
praise
you
when
you
talk
sense
socrates
think
and
tell
me
whether
you
would
approve
of
another
view
of
mine
to
me
every
man
appears
to
be
most
the
friend
of
him
who
is
most
like
to
him
like
to
like
as
ancient
sages
say
would
you
not
agree
to
this
callicles
i
should
socrates
but
when
the
tyrant
is
rude
and
uneducated
he
may
be
expected
to
fear
any
one
who
is
his
superior
in
virtue
and
will
never
be
able
to
be
perfectly
friendly
with
him
callicles
that
is
true
socrates
neither
will
he
be
the
friend
of
any
one
who
is
greatly
his
inferior
for
the
tyrant
will
despise
him
and
will
never
seriously
regard
him
as
a
friend
callicles
that
again
is
true
socrates
then
the
only
friend
worth
mentioning
whom
the
tyrant
can
have
will
be
one
who
is
of
the
same
character
and
has
the
same
likes
and
dislikes
and
is
at
the
same
time
willing
to
be
subject
and
subservient
to
him
he
is
the
man
who
will
have
power
in
the
state
and
no
one
will
injure
him
with
impunity
is
not
that
so
callicles
yes
socrates
and
if
a
young
man
begins
to
ask
how
he
may
become
great
and
formidable
this
would
seem
to
be
the
way
he
will
accustom
himself
from
his
youth
upward
to
feel
sorrow
and
joy
on
the
same
occasions
as
his
master
and
will
contrive
to
be
as
like
him
as
possible
callicles
yes
socrates
and
in
this
way
he
will
have
accomplished
as
you
and
your
friends
would
say
the
end
of
becoming
a
great
man
and
not
suffering
injury
callicles
very
true
socrates
but
will
he
also
escape
from
doing
injury
must
not
the
very
opposite
be
true
if
he
is
to
be
like
the
tyrant
in
his
injustice
and
to
have
influence
with
him
will
he
not
rather
contrive
to
do
as
much
wrong
as
possible
and
not
be
punished
callicles
true
socrates
and
by
the
imitation
of
his
master
and
by
the
power
which
he
thus
acquires
will
not
his
soul
become
bad
and
corrupted
and
will
not
this
be
the
greatest
evil
to
him
callicles
you
always
contrive
somehow
or
other
socrates
to
invert
everything
do
you
not
know
that
he
who
imitates
the
tyrant
will
if
he
has
a
mind
kill
him
who
does
not
imitate
him
and
take
away
his
goods
socrates
excellent
callicles
i
am
not
deaf
and
i
have
heard
that
a
great
many
times
from
you
and
from
polus
and
from
nearly
every
man
in
the
city
but
i
wish
that
you
would
hear
me
too
i
dare
say
that
he
will
kill
him
if
he
has
a
mind
the
bad
man
will
kill
the
good
and
true
callicles
and
is
not
that
just
the
provoking
thing
socrates
nay
not
to
a
man
of
sense
as
the
argument
shows
do
you
think
that
all
our
cares
should
be
directed
to
prolonging
life
to
the
uttermost
and
to
the
study
of
those
arts
which
secure
us
from
danger
always
like
that
art
of
rhetoric
which
saves
men
in
courts
of
law
and
which
you
advise
me
to
cultivate
callicles
yes
truly
and
very
good
advice
too
socrates
well
my
friend
but
what
do
you
think
of
swimming
is
that
an
art
of
any
great
pretensions
callicles
no
indeed
socrates
and
yet
surely
swimming
saves
a
man
from
death
and
there
are
occasions
on
which
he
must
know
how
to
swim
and
if
you
despise
the
swimmers
i
will
tell
you
of
another
and
greater
art
the
art
of
the
pilot
who
not
only
saves
the
souls
of
men
but
also
their
bodies
and
properties
from
the
extremity
of
danger
just
like
rhetoric
yet
his
art
is
modest
and
unpresuming
it
has
no
airs
or
pretences
of
doing
anything
extraordinary
and
in
return
for
the
same
salvation
which
is
given
by
the
pleader
demands
only
two
obols
if
he
brings
us
from
aegina
to
athens
or
for
the
longer
voyage
from
pontus
or
egypt
at
the
utmost
two
drachmae
when
he
has
saved
as
i
was
just
now
saying
the
passenger
and
his
wife
and
children
and
goods
and
safely
disembarked
them
at
the
piraeus
this
is
the
payment
which
he
asks
in
return
for
so
great
a
boon
and
he
who
is
the
master
of
the
art
and
has
done
all
this
gets
out
and
walks
about
on
the
by
his
ship
in
an
unassuming
way
for
he
is
able
to
reflect
and
is
aware
that
he
can
not
tell
which
of
his
he
has
benefited
and
which
of
them
he
has
injured
in
not
allowing
them
to
be
drowned
he
knows
that
they
are
just
the
same
when
he
has
disembarked
them
as
when
they
embarked
and
not
a
whit
better
either
in
their
bodies
or
in
their
souls
and
he
considers
that
if
a
man
who
is
afflicted
by
great
and
incurable
bodily
diseases
is
only
to
be
pitied
for
having
escaped
and
is
in
no
way
benefited
by
him
in
having
been
saved
from
drowning
much
less
he
who
has
great
and
incurable
diseases
not
of
the
body
but
of
the
soul
which
is
the
more
valuable
part
of
him
neither
is
life
worth
having
nor
of
any
profit
to
the
bad
man
whether
he
be
delivered
from
the
sea
or
the
or
any
other
devourer
and
so
he
reflects
that
such
a
one
had
better
not
live
for
he
can
not
live
well
compare
republic
and
this
is
the
reason
why
the
pilot
although
he
is
our
saviour
is
not
usually
conceited
any
more
than
the
engineer
who
is
not
at
all
behind
either
the
general
or
the
pilot
or
any
one
else
in
his
saving
power
for
he
sometimes
saves
whole
cities
is
there
any
comparison
between
him
and
the
pleader
and
if
he
were
to
talk
callicles
in
your
grandiose
style
he
would
bury
you
under
a
mountain
of
words
declaring
and
insisting
that
we
ought
all
of
us
to
be
and
that
no
other
profession
is
worth
thinking
about
he
would
have
plenty
to
say
nevertheless
you
despise
him
and
his
art
and
sneeringly
call
him
an
and
you
will
not
allow
your
daughters
to
marry
his
son
or
marry
your
son
to
his
daughters
and
yet
on
your
principle
what
justice
or
reason
is
there
in
your
refusal
what
right
have
you
to
despise
the
and
the
others
whom
i
was
just
now
mentioning
i
know
that
you
will
say
am
better
and
better
born
but
if
the
better
is
not
what
i
say
and
virtue
consists
only
in
a
man
saving
himself
and
his
whatever
may
be
his
character
then
your
censure
of
the
and
of
the
physician
and
of
the
other
arts
of
salvation
is
ridiculous
o
my
friend
i
want
you
to
see
that
the
noble
and
the
good
may
possibly
be
something
different
from
saving
and
being
saved
may
not
he
who
is
truly
a
man
cease
to
care
about
living
a
certain
time
he
knows
as
women
say
that
no
man
can
escape
fate
and
therefore
he
is
not
fond
of
life
he
leaves
all
that
with
god
and
considers
in
what
way
he
can
best
spend
his
appointed
term
whether
by
assimilating
himself
to
the
constitution
under
which
he
lives
as
you
at
this
moment
have
to
consider
how
you
may
become
as
like
as
possible
to
the
athenian
people
if
you
mean
to
be
in
their
good
graces
and
to
have
power
in
the
state
whereas
i
want
you
to
think
and
see
whether
this
is
for
the
interest
of
either
of
us
i
would
not
have
us
risk
that
which
is
dearest
on
the
acquisition
of
this
power
like
the
thessalian
enchantresses
who
as
they
say
bring
down
the
moon
from
heaven
at
the
risk
of
their
own
perdition
but
if
you
suppose
that
any
man
will
show
you
the
art
of
becoming
great
in
the
city
and
yet
not
conforming
yourself
to
the
ways
of
the
city
whether
for
better
or
worse
then
i
can
only
say
that
you
are
mistaken
callides
for
he
who
would
deserve
to
be
the
true
natural
friend
of
the
athenian
demus
aye
or
of
pyrilampes
darling
who
is
called
after
them
must
be
by
nature
like
them
and
not
an
imitator
only
he
then
who
will
make
you
most
like
them
will
make
you
as
you
desire
a
statesman
and
orator
for
every
man
is
pleased
when
he
is
spoken
to
in
his
own
language
and
spirit
and
dislikes
any
other
but
perhaps
you
sweet
callicles
may
be
of
another
mind
what
do
you
say
callicles
somehow
or
other
your
words
socrates
always
appear
to
me
to
be
good
words
and
yet
like
the
rest
of
the
world
i
am
not
quite
convinced
by
them
compare
symp
alcib
socrates
the
reason
is
callicles
that
the
love
of
demus
which
abides
in
your
soul
is
an
adversary
to
me
but
i
dare
say
that
if
we
recur
to
these
same
matters
and
consider
them
more
thoroughly
you
may
be
convinced
for
all
that
please
then
to
remember
that
there
are
two
processes
of
training
all
things
including
body
and
soul
in
the
one
as
we
said
we
treat
them
with
a
view
to
pleasure
and
in
the
other
with
a
view
to
the
highest
good
and
then
we
do
not
indulge
but
resist
them
was
not
that
the
distinction
which
we
drew
callicles
very
true
socrates
and
the
one
which
had
pleasure
in
view
was
just
a
vulgar
flattery
was
not
that
another
of
our
conclusions
callicles
be
it
so
if
you
will
have
it
socrates
and
the
other
had
in
view
the
greatest
improvement
of
that
which
was
ministered
to
whether
body
or
soul
callicles
quite
true
socrates
and
must
we
not
have
the
same
end
in
view
in
the
treatment
of
our
city
and
citizens
must
we
not
try
and
make
them
as
good
as
possible
for
we
have
already
discovered
that
there
is
no
use
in
imparting
to
them
any
other
good
unless
the
mind
of
those
who
are
to
have
the
good
whether
money
or
office
or
any
other
sort
of
power
be
gentle
and
good
shall
we
say
that
callicles
yes
certainly
if
you
like
socrates
well
then
if
you
and
i
callicles
were
intending
to
set
about
some
public
business
and
were
advising
one
another
to
undertake
buildings
such
as
walls
docks
or
temples
of
the
largest
size
ought
we
not
to
examine
ourselves
first
as
to
whether
we
know
or
do
not
know
the
art
of
building
and
who
taught
us
would
not
that
be
necessary
callicles
callicles
true
socrates
in
the
second
place
we
should
have
to
consider
whether
we
had
ever
constructed
any
private
house
either
of
our
own
or
for
our
friends
and
whether
this
building
of
ours
was
a
success
or
not
and
if
upon
consideration
we
found
that
we
had
had
good
and
eminent
masters
and
had
been
successful
in
constructing
many
fine
buildings
not
only
with
their
assistance
but
without
them
by
our
own
unaided
skill
in
that
case
prudence
would
not
dissuade
us
from
proceeding
to
the
construction
of
public
works
but
if
we
had
no
master
to
show
and
only
a
number
of
worthless
buildings
or
none
at
all
then
surely
it
would
be
ridiculous
in
us
to
attempt
public
works
or
to
advise
one
another
to
undertake
them
is
not
this
true
callicles
certainly
socrates
and
does
not
the
same
hold
in
all
other
cases
if
you
and
i
were
physicians
and
were
advising
one
another
that
we
were
competent
to
practise
as
should
i
not
ask
about
you
and
would
you
not
ask
about
me
well
but
how
about
socrates
himself
has
he
good
health
and
was
any
one
else
ever
known
to
be
cured
by
him
whether
slave
or
freeman
and
i
should
make
the
same
enquiries
about
you
and
if
we
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
no
one
whether
citizen
or
stranger
man
or
woman
had
ever
been
any
the
better
for
the
medical
skill
of
either
of
us
then
by
heaven
callicles
what
an
absurdity
to
think
that
we
or
any
human
being
should
be
so
silly
as
to
set
up
as
and
advise
others
like
ourselves
to
do
the
same
without
having
first
practised
in
private
whether
successfully
or
not
and
acquired
experience
of
the
art
is
not
this
as
they
say
to
begin
with
the
big
jar
when
you
are
learning
the
potter
art
which
is
a
foolish
thing
callicles
true
socrates
and
now
my
friend
as
you
are
already
beginning
to
be
a
public
character
and
are
admonishing
and
reproaching
me
for
not
being
one
suppose
that
we
ask
a
few
questions
of
one
another
tell
me
then
callicles
how
about
making
any
of
the
citizens
better
was
there
ever
a
man
who
was
once
vicious
or
unjust
or
intemperate
or
foolish
and
became
by
the
help
of
callicles
good
and
noble
was
there
ever
such
a
man
whether
citizen
or
stranger
slave
or
freeman
tell
me
callicles
if
a
person
were
to
ask
these
questions
of
you
what
would
you
answer
whom
would
you
say
that
you
had
improved
by
your
conversation
there
may
have
been
good
deeds
of
this
sort
which
were
done
by
you
as
a
private
person
before
you
came
forward
in
public
why
will
you
not
answer
callicles
you
are
contentious
socrates
socrates
nay
i
ask
you
not
from
a
love
of
contention
but
because
i
really
want
to
know
in
what
way
you
think
that
affairs
should
be
administered
among
us
whether
when
you
come
to
the
administration
of
them
you
have
any
other
aim
but
the
improvement
of
the
citizens
have
we
not
already
admitted
many
times
over
that
such
is
the
duty
of
a
public
man
nay
we
have
surely
said
so
for
if
you
will
not
answer
for
yourself
i
must
answer
for
you
but
if
this
is
what
the
good
man
ought
to
effect
for
the
benefit
of
his
own
state
allow
me
to
recall
to
you
the
names
of
those
whom
you
were
just
now
mentioning
pericles
and
cimon
and
miltiades
and
themistocles
and
ask
whether
you
still
think
that
they
were
good
citizens
callicles
i
do
socrates
but
if
they
were
good
then
clearly
each
of
them
must
have
made
the
citizens
better
instead
of
worse
callicles
yes
socrates
and
therefore
when
pericles
first
began
to
speak
in
the
assembly
the
athenians
were
not
so
good
as
when
he
spoke
last
callicles
very
likely
socrates
nay
my
friend
is
not
the
word
for
if
he
was
a
good
citizen
the
inference
is
certain
callicles
and
what
difference
does
that
make
socrates
none
only
i
should
like
further
to
know
whether
the
athenians
are
supposed
to
have
been
made
better
by
pericles
or
on
the
contrary
to
have
been
corrupted
by
him
for
i
hear
that
he
was
the
first
who
gave
the
people
pay
and
made
them
idle
and
cowardly
and
encouraged
them
in
the
love
of
talk
and
money
callicles
you
heard
that
socrates
from
the
laconising
set
who
bruise
their
ears
socrates
but
what
i
am
going
to
tell
you
now
is
not
mere
hearsay
but
well
known
both
to
you
and
me
that
at
first
pericles
was
glorious
and
his
character
unimpeached
by
any
verdict
of
the
athenians
this
was
during
the
time
when
they
were
not
so
good
yet
afterwards
when
they
had
been
made
good
and
gentle
by
him
at
the
very
end
of
his
life
they
convicted
him
of
theft
and
almost
put
him
to
death
clearly
under
the
notion
that
he
was
a
malefactor
callicles
well
but
how
does
that
prove
pericles
badness
socrates
why
surely
you
would
say
that
he
was
a
bad
manager
of
asses
or
horses
or
oxen
who
had
received
them
originally
neither
kicking
nor
butting
nor
biting
him
and
implanted
in
them
all
these
savage
tricks
would
he
not
be
a
bad
manager
of
any
animals
who
received
them
gentle
and
made
them
fiercer
than
they
were
when
he
received
them
what
do
you
say
callicles
i
will
do
you
the
favour
of
saying
socrates
and
will
you
also
do
me
the
favour
of
saying
whether
man
is
an
animal
callicles
certainly
he
is
socrates
and
was
not
pericles
a
shepherd
of
men
callicles
yes
socrates
and
if
he
was
a
good
political
shepherd
ought
not
the
animals
who
were
his
subjects
as
we
were
just
now
acknowledging
to
have
become
more
just
and
not
more
unjust
callicles
quite
true
socrates
and
are
not
just
men
gentle
as
homer
says
or
are
you
of
another
mind
callicles
i
agree
socrates
and
yet
he
really
did
make
them
more
savage
than
he
received
them
and
their
savageness
was
shown
towards
himself
which
he
must
have
been
very
far
from
desiring
callicles
do
you
want
me
to
agree
with
you
socrates
yes
if
i
seem
to
you
to
speak
the
truth
callicles
granted
then
socrates
and
if
they
were
more
savage
must
they
not
have
been
more
unjust
and
inferior
callicles
granted
again
socrates
then
upon
this
view
pericles
was
not
a
good
statesman
callicles
that
is
upon
your
view
socrates
nay
the
view
is
yours
after
what
you
have
admitted
take
the
case
of
cimon
again
did
not
the
very
persons
whom
he
was
serving
ostracize
him
in
order
that
they
might
not
hear
his
voice
for
ten
years
and
they
did
just
the
same
to
themistocles
adding
the
penalty
of
exile
and
they
voted
that
miltiades
the
hero
of
marathon
should
be
thrown
into
the
pit
of
death
and
he
was
only
saved
by
the
prytanis
and
yet
if
they
had
been
really
good
men
as
you
say
these
things
would
never
have
happened
to
them
for
the
good
charioteers
are
not
those
who
at
first
keep
their
place
and
then
when
they
have
their
horses
and
themselves
become
better
charioteers
are
thrown
out
that
is
not
the
way
either
in
charioteering
or
in
any
what
do
you
think
callicles
i
should
think
not
socrates
well
but
if
so
the
truth
is
as
i
have
said
already
that
in
the
athenian
state
no
one
has
ever
shown
himself
to
be
a
good
statesman
you
admitted
that
this
was
true
of
our
present
statesmen
but
not
true
of
former
ones
and
you
preferred
them
to
the
others
yet
they
have
turned
out
to
be
no
better
than
our
present
ones
and
therefore
if
they
were
rhetoricians
they
did
not
use
the
true
art
of
rhetoric
or
of
flattery
or
they
would
not
have
fallen
out
of
favour
callicles
but
surely
socrates
no
living
man
ever
came
near
any
one
of
them
in
his
performances
socrates
o
my
dear
friend
i
say
nothing
against
them
regarded
as
the
of
the
state
and
i
do
think
that
they
were
certainly
more
serviceable
than
those
who
are
living
now
and
better
able
to
gratify
the
wishes
of
the
state
but
as
to
transforming
those
desires
and
not
allowing
them
to
have
their
way
and
using
the
powers
which
they
had
whether
of
persuasion
or
of
force
in
the
improvement
of
their
fellow
citizens
which
is
the
prime
object
of
the
truly
good
citizen
i
do
not
see
that
in
these
respects
they
were
a
whit
superior
to
our
present
statesmen
although
i
do
admit
that
they
were
more
clever
at
providing
ships
and
walls
and
docks
and
all
that
you
and
i
have
a
ridiculous
way
for
during
the
whole
time
that
we
are
arguing
we
are
always
going
round
and
round
to
the
same
point
and
constantly
misunderstanding
one
another
if
i
am
not
mistaken
you
have
admitted
and
acknowledged
more
than
once
that
there
are
two
kinds
of
operations
which
have
to
do
with
the
body
and
two
which
have
to
do
with
the
soul
one
of
the
two
is
ministerial
and
if
our
bodies
are
hungry
provides
food
for
them
and
if
they
are
thirsty
gives
them
drink
or
if
they
are
cold
supplies
them
with
garments
blankets
shoes
and
all
that
they
crave
i
use
the
same
images
as
before
intentionally
in
order
that
you
may
understand
me
the
better
the
purveyor
of
the
articles
may
provide
them
either
wholesale
or
retail
or
he
may
be
the
maker
of
any
of
them
the
baker
or
the
cook
or
the
weaver
or
the
shoemaker
or
the
currier
and
in
so
doing
being
such
as
he
is
he
is
naturally
supposed
by
himself
and
every
one
to
minister
to
the
body
for
none
of
them
know
that
there
is
another
art
an
art
of
gymnastic
and
medicine
which
is
the
true
minister
of
the
body
and
ought
to
be
the
mistress
of
all
the
rest
and
to
use
their
results
according
to
the
knowledge
which
she
has
and
they
have
not
of
the
real
good
or
bad
effects
of
meats
and
drinks
on
the
body
all
other
arts
which
have
to
do
with
the
body
are
servile
and
menial
and
illiberal
and
gymnastic
and
medicine
are
as
they
ought
to
be
their
mistresses
now
when
i
say
that
all
this
is
equally
true
of
the
soul
you
seem
at
first
to
know
and
understand
and
assent
to
my
words
and
then
a
little
while
afterwards
you
come
repeating
has
not
the
state
had
good
and
noble
citizens
and
when
i
ask
you
who
they
are
you
reply
seemingly
quite
in
earnest
as
if
i
had
asked
who
are
or
have
been
good
trainers
and
you
had
replied
thearion
the
baker
mithoecus
who
wrote
the
sicilian
sarambus
the
vintner
these
are
ministers
of
the
body
in
their
art
for
the
first
makes
admirable
loaves
the
second
excellent
dishes
and
the
third
capital
wine
to
me
these
appear
to
be
the
exact
parallel
of
the
statesmen
whom
you
mention
now
you
would
not
be
altogether
pleased
if
i
said
to
you
my
friend
you
know
nothing
of
gymnastics
those
of
whom
you
are
speaking
to
me
are
only
the
ministers
and
purveyors
of
luxury
who
have
no
good
or
noble
notions
of
their
art
and
may
very
likely
be
filling
and
fattening
men
bodies
and
gaining
their
approval
although
the
result
is
that
they
lose
their
original
flesh
in
the
long
run
and
become
thinner
than
they
were
before
and
yet
they
in
their
simplicity
will
not
attribute
their
diseases
and
loss
of
flesh
to
their
entertainers
but
when
in
after
years
the
unhealthy
surfeit
brings
the
attendant
penalty
of
disease
he
who
happens
to
be
near
them
at
the
time
and
offers
them
advice
is
accused
and
blamed
by
them
and
if
they
could
they
would
do
him
some
harm
while
they
proceed
to
eulogize
the
men
who
have
been
the
real
authors
of
the
mischief
and
that
callicles
is
just
what
you
are
now
doing
you
praise
the
men
who
feasted
the
citizens
and
satisfied
their
desires
and
people
say
that
they
have
made
the
city
great
not
seeing
that
the
swollen
and
ulcerated
condition
of
the
state
is
to
be
attributed
to
these
elder
statesmen
for
they
have
filled
the
city
full
of
harbours
and
docks
and
walls
and
revenues
and
all
that
and
have
left
no
room
for
justice
and
temperance
and
when
the
crisis
of
the
disorder
comes
the
people
will
blame
the
advisers
of
the
hour
and
applaud
themistocles
and
cimon
and
pericles
who
are
the
real
authors
of
their
calamities
and
if
you
are
not
careful
they
may
assail
you
and
my
friend
alcibiades
when
they
are
losing
not
only
their
new
acquisitions
but
also
their
original
possessions
not
that
you
are
the
authors
of
these
misfortunes
of
theirs
although
you
may
perhaps
be
accessories
to
them
a
great
piece
of
work
is
always
being
made
as
i
see
and
am
told
now
as
of
old
about
our
statesmen
when
the
state
treats
any
of
them
as
malefactors
i
observe
that
there
is
a
great
uproar
and
indignation
at
the
supposed
wrong
which
is
done
to
them
all
their
many
services
to
the
state
that
they
should
unjustly
perish
so
the
tale
runs
but
the
cry
is
all
a
lie
for
no
statesman
ever
could
be
unjustly
put
to
death
by
the
city
of
which
he
is
the
head
the
case
of
the
professed
statesman
is
i
believe
very
much
like
that
of
the
professed
sophist
for
the
sophists
although
they
are
wise
men
are
nevertheless
guilty
of
a
strange
piece
of
folly
professing
to
be
teachers
of
virtue
they
will
often
accuse
their
disciples
of
wronging
them
and
defrauding
them
of
their
pay
and
showing
no
gratitude
for
their
services
yet
what
can
be
more
absurd
than
that
men
who
have
become
just
and
good
and
whose
injustice
has
been
taken
away
from
them
and
who
have
had
justice
implanted
in
them
by
their
teachers
should
act
unjustly
by
reason
of
the
injustice
which
is
not
in
them
can
anything
be
more
irrational
my
friends
than
this
you
callicles
compel
me
to
be
a
because
you
will
not
answer
callicles
and
you
are
the
man
who
can
not
speak
unless
there
is
some
one
to
answer
socrates
i
suppose
that
i
can
just
now
at
any
rate
the
speeches
which
i
am
making
are
long
enough
because
you
refuse
to
answer
me
but
i
adjure
you
by
the
god
of
friendship
my
good
sir
do
tell
me
whether
there
does
not
appear
to
you
to
be
a
great
inconsistency
in
saying
that
you
have
made
a
man
good
and
then
blaming
him
for
being
bad
callicles
yes
it
appears
so
to
me
socrates
do
you
never
hear
our
professors
of
education
speaking
in
this
inconsistent
manner
callicles
yes
but
why
talk
of
men
who
are
good
for
nothing
socrates
i
would
rather
say
why
talk
of
men
who
profess
to
be
rulers
and
declare
that
they
are
devoted
to
the
improvement
of
the
city
and
nevertheless
upon
occasion
declaim
against
the
utter
vileness
of
the
city
do
you
think
that
there
is
any
difference
between
one
and
the
other
my
good
friend
the
sophist
and
the
rhetorician
as
i
was
saying
to
polus
are
the
same
or
nearly
the
same
but
you
ignorantly
fancy
that
rhetoric
is
a
perfect
thing
and
sophistry
a
thing
to
be
despised
whereas
the
truth
is
that
sophistry
is
as
much
superior
to
rhetoric
as
legislation
is
to
the
practice
of
law
or
gymnastic
to
medicine
the
orators
and
sophists
as
i
am
inclined
to
think
are
the
only
class
who
can
not
complain
of
the
mischief
ensuing
to
themselves
from
that
which
they
teach
others
without
in
the
same
breath
accusing
themselves
of
having
done
no
good
to
those
whom
they
profess
to
benefit
is
not
this
a
fact
callicles
certainly
it
is
socrates
if
they
were
right
in
saying
that
they
make
men
better
then
they
are
the
only
class
who
can
afford
to
leave
their
remuneration
to
those
who
have
been
benefited
by
them
whereas
if
a
man
has
been
benefited
in
any
other
way
if
for
example
he
has
been
taught
to
run
by
a
trainer
he
might
possibly
defraud
him
of
his
pay
if
the
trainer
left
the
matter
to
him
and
made
no
agreement
with
him
that
he
should
receive
money
as
soon
as
he
had
given
him
the
utmost
speed
for
not
because
of
any
deficiency
of
speed
do
men
act
unjustly
but
by
reason
of
injustice
callicles
very
true
socrates
and
he
who
removes
injustice
can
be
in
no
danger
of
being
treated
unjustly
he
alone
can
safely
leave
the
honorarium
to
his
pupils
if
he
be
really
able
to
make
them
good
am
i
not
right
compare
protag
callicles
yes
socrates
then
we
have
found
the
reason
why
there
is
no
dishonour
in
a
man
receiving
pay
who
is
called
in
to
advise
about
building
or
any
other
art
callicles
yes
we
have
found
the
reason
socrates
but
when
the
point
is
how
a
man
may
become
best
himself
and
best
govern
his
family
and
state
then
to
say
that
you
will
give
no
advice
gratis
is
held
to
be
dishonourable
callicles
true
socrates
and
why
because
only
such
benefits
call
forth
a
desire
to
requite
them
and
there
is
evidence
that
a
benefit
has
been
conferred
when
the
benefactor
receives
a
return
otherwise
not
is
this
true
callicles
it
is
socrates
then
to
which
service
of
the
state
do
you
invite
me
determine
for
me
am
i
to
be
the
physician
of
the
state
who
will
strive
and
struggle
to
make
the
athenians
as
good
as
possible
or
am
i
to
be
the
servant
and
flatterer
of
the
state
speak
out
my
good
friend
freely
and
fairly
as
you
did
at
first
and
ought
to
do
again
and
tell
me
your
entire
mind
callicles
i
say
then
that
you
should
be
the
servant
of
the
state
socrates
the
flatterer
well
sir
that
is
a
noble
invitation
callicles
the
mysian
socrates
or
what
you
please
for
if
you
refuse
the
consequences
will
be
socrates
do
not
repeat
the
old
story
that
he
who
likes
will
kill
me
and
get
my
money
for
then
i
shall
have
to
repeat
the
old
answer
that
he
will
be
a
bad
man
and
will
kill
the
good
and
that
the
money
will
be
of
no
use
to
him
but
that
he
will
wrongly
use
that
which
he
wrongly
took
and
if
wrongly
basely
and
if
basely
hurtfully
callicles
how
confident
you
are
socrates
that
you
will
never
come
to
harm
you
seem
to
think
that
you
are
living
in
another
country
and
can
never
be
brought
into
a
court
of
justice
as
you
very
likely
may
be
brought
by
some
miserable
and
mean
person
socrates
then
i
must
indeed
be
a
fool
callicles
if
i
do
not
know
that
in
the
athenian
state
any
man
may
suffer
anything
and
if
i
am
brought
to
trial
and
incur
the
dangers
of
which
you
speak
he
will
be
a
villain
who
brings
me
to
trial
of
that
i
am
very
sure
for
no
good
man
would
accuse
the
innocent
nor
shall
i
be
surprised
if
i
am
put
to
death
shall
i
tell
you
why
i
anticipate
this
callicles
by
all
means
socrates
i
think
that
i
am
the
only
or
almost
the
only
athenian
living
who
practises
the
true
art
of
politics
i
am
the
only
politician
of
my
time
now
seeing
that
when
i
speak
my
words
are
not
uttered
with
any
view
of
gaining
favour
and
that
i
look
to
what
is
best
and
not
to
what
is
most
pleasant
having
no
mind
to
use
those
arts
and
graces
which
you
recommend
i
shall
have
nothing
to
say
in
the
justice
court
and
you
might
argue
with
me
as
i
was
arguing
with
polus
i
shall
be
tried
just
as
a
physician
would
be
tried
in
a
court
of
little
boys
at
the
indictment
of
the
cook
what
would
he
reply
under
such
circumstances
if
some
one
were
to
accuse
him
saying
my
boys
many
evil
things
has
this
man
done
to
you
he
is
the
death
of
you
especially
of
the
younger
ones
among
you
cutting
and
burning
and
starving
and
suffocating
you
until
you
know
not
what
to
do
he
gives
you
the
bitterest
potions
and
compels
you
to
hunger
and
thirst
how
unlike
the
variety
of
meats
and
sweets
on
which
i
feasted
you
what
do
you
suppose
that
the
physician
would
be
able
to
reply
when
he
found
himself
in
such
a
predicament
if
he
told
the
truth
he
could
only
say
these
evil
things
my
boys
i
did
for
your
health
and
then
would
there
not
just
be
a
clamour
among
a
jury
like
that
how
they
would
cry
out
callicles
i
dare
say
socrates
would
he
not
be
utterly
at
a
loss
for
a
reply
callicles
he
certainly
would
socrates
and
i
too
shall
be
treated
in
the
same
way
as
i
well
know
if
i
am
brought
before
the
court
for
i
shall
not
be
able
to
rehearse
to
the
people
the
pleasures
which
i
have
procured
for
them
and
which
although
i
am
not
disposed
to
envy
either
the
procurers
or
enjoyers
of
them
are
deemed
by
them
to
be
benefits
and
advantages
and
if
any
one
says
that
i
corrupt
young
men
and
perplex
their
minds
or
that
i
speak
evil
of
old
men
and
use
bitter
words
towards
them
whether
in
private
or
public
it
is
useless
for
me
to
reply
as
i
truly
might
this
i
do
for
the
sake
of
justice
and
with
a
view
to
your
interest
my
judges
and
to
nothing
else
and
therefore
there
is
no
saying
what
may
happen
to
me
callicles
and
do
you
think
socrates
that
a
man
who
is
thus
defenceless
is
in
a
good
position
socrates
yes
callicles
if
he
have
that
defence
which
as
you
have
often
acknowledged
he
should
have
if
he
be
his
own
defence
and
have
never
said
or
done
anything
wrong
either
in
respect
of
gods
or
men
and
this
has
been
repeatedly
acknowledged
by
us
to
be
the
best
sort
of
defence
and
if
any
one
could
convict
me
of
inability
to
defend
myself
or
others
after
this
sort
i
should
blush
for
shame
whether
i
was
convicted
before
many
or
before
a
few
or
by
myself
alone
and
if
i
died
from
want
of
ability
to
do
so
that
would
indeed
grieve
me
but
if
i
died
because
i
have
no
powers
of
flattery
or
rhetoric
i
am
very
sure
that
you
would
not
find
me
repining
at
death
for
no
man
who
is
not
an
utter
fool
and
coward
is
afraid
of
death
itself
but
he
is
afraid
of
doing
wrong
for
to
go
to
the
world
below
having
one
soul
full
of
injustice
is
the
last
and
worst
of
all
evils
and
in
proof
of
what
i
say
if
you
have
no
objection
i
should
like
to
tell
you
a
story
callicles
very
well
proceed
and
then
we
shall
have
done
socrates
listen
then
as
say
to
a
very
pretty
tale
which
i
dare
say
that
you
may
be
disposed
to
regard
as
a
fable
only
but
which
as
i
believe
is
a
true
tale
for
i
mean
to
speak
the
truth
homer
tells
us
il
how
zeus
and
poseidon
and
pluto
divided
the
empire
which
they
inherited
from
their
father
now
in
the
days
of
cronos
there
existed
a
law
respecting
the
destiny
of
man
which
has
always
been
and
still
continues
to
be
in
heaven
that
he
who
has
lived
all
his
life
in
justice
and
holiness
shall
go
when
he
is
dead
to
the
islands
of
the
blessed
and
dwell
there
in
perfect
happiness
out
of
the
reach
of
evil
but
that
he
who
has
lived
unjustly
and
impiously
shall
go
to
the
house
of
vengeance
and
punishment
which
is
called
tartarus
and
in
the
time
of
cronos
and
even
quite
lately
in
the
reign
of
zeus
the
judgment
was
given
on
the
very
day
on
which
the
men
were
to
die
the
judges
were
alive
and
the
men
were
alive
and
the
consequence
was
that
the
judgments
were
not
well
given
then
pluto
and
the
authorities
from
the
islands
of
the
blessed
came
to
zeus
and
said
that
the
souls
found
their
way
to
the
wrong
places
zeus
said
shall
put
a
stop
to
this
the
judgments
are
not
well
given
because
the
persons
who
are
judged
have
their
clothes
on
for
they
are
alive
and
there
are
many
who
having
evil
souls
are
apparelled
in
fair
bodies
or
encased
in
wealth
or
rank
and
when
the
day
of
judgment
arrives
numerous
witnesses
come
forward
and
testify
on
their
behalf
that
they
have
lived
righteously
the
judges
are
awed
by
them
and
they
themselves
too
have
their
clothes
on
when
judging
their
eyes
and
ears
and
their
whole
bodies
are
interposed
as
a
veil
before
their
own
souls
all
this
is
a
hindrance
to
them
there
are
the
clothes
of
the
judges
and
the
clothes
of
the
what
is
to
be
done
i
will
tell
you
in
the
first
place
i
will
deprive
men
of
the
foreknowledge
of
death
which
they
possess
at
present
this
power
which
they
have
prometheus
has
already
received
my
orders
to
take
from
them
in
the
second
place
they
shall
be
entirely
stripped
before
they
are
judged
for
they
shall
be
judged
when
they
are
dead
and
the
judge
too
shall
be
naked
that
is
to
say
dead
he
with
his
naked
soul
shall
pierce
into
the
other
naked
souls
and
they
shall
die
suddenly
and
be
deprived
of
all
their
kindred
and
leave
their
brave
attire
strewn
upon
the
earth
conducted
in
this
manner
the
judgment
will
be
just
i
knew
all
about
the
matter
before
any
of
you
and
therefore
i
have
made
my
sons
judges
two
from
asia
minos
and
rhadamanthus
and
one
from
europe
aeacus
and
these
when
they
are
dead
shall
give
judgment
in
the
meadow
at
the
parting
of
the
ways
whence
the
two
roads
lead
one
to
the
islands
of
the
blessed
and
the
other
to
tartarus
rhadamanthus
shall
judge
those
who
come
from
asia
and
aeacus
those
who
come
from
europe
and
to
minos
i
shall
give
the
primacy
and
he
shall
hold
a
court
of
appeal
in
case
either
of
the
two
others
are
in
any
doubt
then
the
judgment
respecting
the
last
journey
of
men
will
be
as
just
as
possible
from
this
tale
callicles
which
i
have
heard
and
believe
i
draw
the
following
inferences
death
if
i
am
right
is
in
the
first
place
the
separation
from
one
another
of
two
things
soul
and
body
nothing
else
and
after
they
are
separated
they
retain
their
several
natures
as
in
life
the
body
keeps
the
same
habit
and
the
results
of
treatment
or
accident
are
distinctly
visible
in
it
for
example
he
who
by
nature
or
training
or
both
was
a
tall
man
while
he
was
alive
will
remain
as
he
was
after
he
is
dead
and
the
fat
man
will
remain
fat
and
so
on
and
the
dead
man
who
in
life
had
a
fancy
to
have
flowing
hair
will
have
flowing
hair
and
if
he
was
marked
with
the
whip
and
had
the
prints
of
the
scourge
or
of
wounds
in
him
when
he
was
alive
you
might
see
the
same
in
the
dead
body
and
if
his
limbs
were
broken
or
misshapen
when
he
was
alive
the
same
appearance
would
be
visible
in
the
dead
and
in
a
word
whatever
was
the
habit
of
the
body
during
life
would
be
distinguishable
after
death
either
perfectly
or
in
a
great
measure
and
for
a
certain
time
and
i
should
imagine
that
this
is
equally
true
of
the
soul
callicles
when
a
man
is
stripped
of
the
body
all
the
natural
or
acquired
affections
of
the
soul
are
laid
open
to
and
when
they
come
to
the
judge
as
those
from
asia
come
to
rhadamanthus
he
places
them
near
him
and
inspects
them
quite
impartially
not
knowing
whose
the
soul
is
perhaps
he
may
lay
hands
on
the
soul
of
the
great
king
or
of
some
other
king
or
potentate
who
has
no
soundness
in
him
but
his
soul
is
marked
with
the
whip
and
is
full
of
the
prints
and
scars
of
perjuries
and
crimes
with
which
each
action
has
stained
him
and
he
is
all
crooked
with
falsehood
and
imposture
and
has
no
straightness
because
he
has
lived
without
truth
him
rhadamanthus
beholds
full
of
all
deformity
and
disproportion
which
is
caused
by
licence
and
luxury
and
insolence
and
incontinence
and
despatches
him
ignominiously
to
his
prison
and
there
he
undergoes
the
punishment
which
he
deserves
now
the
proper
office
of
punishment
is
twofold
he
who
is
rightly
punished
ought
either
to
become
better
and
profit
by
it
or
he
ought
to
be
made
an
example
to
his
fellows
that
they
may
see
what
he
suffers
and
fear
and
become
better
those
who
are
improved
when
they
are
punished
by
gods
and
men
are
those
whose
sins
are
curable
and
they
are
improved
as
in
this
world
so
also
in
another
by
pain
and
suffering
for
there
is
no
other
way
in
which
they
can
be
delivered
from
their
evil
but
they
who
have
been
guilty
of
the
worst
crimes
and
are
incurable
by
reason
of
their
crimes
are
made
examples
for
as
they
are
incurable
the
time
has
passed
at
which
they
can
receive
any
benefit
they
get
no
good
themselves
but
others
get
good
when
they
behold
them
enduring
for
ever
the
most
terrible
and
painful
and
fearful
sufferings
as
the
penalty
of
their
sins
there
they
are
hanging
up
as
examples
in
the
of
the
world
below
a
spectacle
and
a
warning
to
all
unrighteous
men
who
come
thither
and
among
them
as
i
confidently
affirm
will
be
found
archelaus
if
polus
truly
reports
of
him
and
any
other
tyrant
who
is
like
him
of
these
fearful
examples
most
as
i
believe
are
taken
from
the
class
of
tyrants
and
kings
and
potentates
and
public
men
for
they
are
the
authors
of
the
greatest
and
most
impious
crimes
because
they
have
the
power
and
homer
witnesses
to
the
truth
of
this
for
they
are
always
kings
and
potentates
whom
he
has
described
as
suffering
everlasting
punishment
in
the
world
below
such
were
tantalus
and
sisyphus
and
tityus
but
no
one
ever
described
thersites
or
any
private
person
who
was
a
villain
as
suffering
everlasting
punishment
or
as
incurable
for
to
commit
the
worst
crimes
as
i
am
inclined
to
think
was
not
in
his
power
and
he
was
happier
than
those
who
had
the
power
no
callicles
the
very
bad
men
come
from
the
class
of
those
who
have
power
compare
republic
and
yet
in
that
very
class
there
may
arise
good
men
and
worthy
of
all
admiration
they
are
for
where
there
is
great
power
to
do
wrong
to
live
and
to
die
justly
is
a
hard
thing
and
greatly
to
be
praised
and
few
there
are
who
attain
to
this
such
good
and
true
men
however
there
have
been
and
will
be
again
at
athens
and
in
other
states
who
have
fulfilled
their
trust
righteously
and
there
is
one
who
is
quite
famous
all
over
hellas
aristeides
the
son
of
lysimachus
but
in
general
great
men
are
also
bad
my
friend
as
i
was
saying
rhadamanthus
when
he
gets
a
soul
of
the
bad
kind
knows
nothing
about
him
neither
who
he
is
nor
who
his
parents
are
he
knows
only
that
he
has
got
hold
of
a
villain
and
seeing
this
he
stamps
him
as
curable
or
incurable
and
sends
him
away
to
tartarus
whither
he
goes
and
receives
his
proper
recompense
or
again
he
looks
with
admiration
on
the
soul
of
some
just
one
who
has
lived
in
holiness
and
truth
he
may
have
been
a
private
man
or
not
and
i
should
say
callicles
that
he
is
most
likely
to
have
been
a
philosopher
who
has
done
his
own
work
and
not
troubled
himself
with
the
doings
of
other
men
in
his
lifetime
him
rhadamanthus
sends
to
the
islands
of
the
blessed
aeacus
does
the
same
and
they
both
have
sceptres
and
judge
but
minos
alone
has
a
golden
sceptre
and
is
seated
looking
on
as
odysseus
in
homer
declares
that
he
saw
him
a
sceptre
of
gold
and
giving
laws
to
the
dead
now
i
callicles
am
persuaded
of
the
truth
of
these
things
and
i
consider
how
i
shall
present
my
soul
whole
and
undefiled
before
the
judge
in
that
day
renouncing
the
honours
at
which
the
world
aims
i
desire
only
to
know
the
truth
and
to
live
as
well
as
i
can
and
when
i
die
to
die
as
well
as
i
can
and
to
the
utmost
of
my
power
i
exhort
all
other
men
to
do
the
same
and
in
return
for
your
exhortation
of
me
i
exhort
you
also
to
take
part
in
the
great
combat
which
is
the
combat
of
life
and
greater
than
every
other
earthly
conflict
and
i
retort
your
reproach
of
me
and
say
that
you
will
not
be
able
to
help
yourself
when
the
day
of
trial
and
judgment
of
which
i
was
speaking
comes
upon
you
you
will
go
before
the
judge
the
son
of
aegina
and
when
he
has
got
you
in
his
grip
and
is
carrying
you
off
you
will
gape
and
your
head
will
swim
round
just
as
mine
would
in
the
courts
of
this
world
and
very
likely
some
one
will
shamefully
box
you
on
the
ears
and
put
upon
you
any
sort
of
insult
perhaps
this
may
appear
to
you
to
be
only
an
old
wife
tale
which
you
will
contemn
and
there
might
be
reason
in
your
contemning
such
tales
if
by
searching
we
could
find
out
anything
better
or
truer
but
now
you
see
that
you
and
polus
and
gorgias
who
are
the
three
wisest
of
the
greeks
of
our
day
are
not
able
to
show
that
we
ought
to
live
any
life
which
does
not
profit
in
another
world
as
well
as
in
this
and
of
all
that
has
been
said
nothing
remains
unshaken
but
the
saying
that
to
do
injustice
is
more
to
be
avoided
than
to
suffer
injustice
and
that
the
reality
and
not
the
appearance
of
virtue
is
to
be
followed
above
all
things
as
well
in
public
as
in
private
life
and
that
when
any
one
has
been
wrong
in
anything
he
is
to
be
chastised
and
that
the
next
best
thing
to
a
man
being
just
is
that
he
should
become
just
and
be
chastised
and
punished
also
that
he
should
avoid
all
flattery
of
himself
as
well
as
of
others
of
the
few
or
of
the
many
and
rhetoric
and
any
other
art
should
be
used
by
him
and
all
his
actions
should
be
done
always
with
a
view
to
justice
follow
me
then
and
i
will
lead
you
where
you
will
be
happy
in
life
and
after
death
as
the
argument
shows
and
never
mind
if
some
one
despises
you
as
a
fool
and
insults
you
if
he
has
a
mind
let
him
strike
you
by
zeus
and
do
you
be
of
good
cheer
and
do
not
mind
the
insulting
blow
for
you
will
never
come
to
any
harm
in
the
practice
of
virtue
if
you
are
a
really
good
and
true
man
when
we
have
practised
virtue
together
we
will
apply
ourselves
to
politics
if
that
seems
desirable
or
we
will
advise
about
whatever
else
may
seem
good
to
us
for
we
shall
be
better
able
to
judge
then
in
our
present
condition
we
ought
not
to
give
ourselves
airs
for
even
on
the
most
important
subjects
we
are
always
changing
our
minds
so
utterly
stupid
are
we
let
us
then
take
the
argument
as
our
guide
which
has
revealed
to
us
that
the
best
way
of
life
is
to
practise
justice
and
every
virtue
in
life
and
death
this
way
let
us
go
and
in
this
exhort
all
men
to
follow
not
in
the
way
to
which
you
trust
and
in
which
you
exhort
me
to
follow
you
for
that
way
callicles
is
nothing
worth
