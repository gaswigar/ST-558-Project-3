the
duchess
at
prayer
have
you
ever
questioned
the
long
shuttered
front
of
an
old
italian
house
that
motionless
mask
smooth
mute
equivocal
as
the
face
of
a
priest
behind
which
buzz
the
secrets
of
the
confessional
other
houses
declare
the
activities
they
shelter
they
are
the
clear
expressive
cuticle
of
a
life
flowing
close
to
the
surface
but
the
old
palace
in
its
narrow
street
the
villa
on
its
hill
are
as
impenetrable
as
death
the
tall
windows
are
like
blind
eyes
the
great
door
is
a
shut
mouth
inside
there
may
be
sunshine
the
scent
of
myrtles
and
a
pulse
of
life
through
all
the
arteries
of
the
huge
frame
or
a
mortal
solitude
where
bats
lodge
in
the
disjointed
stones
and
the
keys
rust
in
unused
doors
ii
from
the
loggia
with
its
vanishing
frescoes
i
looked
down
an
avenue
barred
by
a
ladder
of
to
the
ducal
escutcheon
and
mutilated
vases
of
the
gate
flat
noon
lay
on
the
gardens
on
fountains
porticoes
and
grottoes
below
the
terrace
where
a
lichen
had
sheeted
the
balustrade
as
with
fine
of
gold
vineyards
stooped
to
the
rich
valley
clasped
in
hills
the
lower
slopes
were
strewn
with
white
villages
like
stars
spangling
a
summer
dusk
and
beyond
these
fold
on
fold
of
blue
mountain
clear
as
gauze
against
the
sky
the
august
air
was
lifeless
but
it
seemed
light
and
vivifying
after
the
atmosphere
of
the
shrouded
rooms
through
which
i
had
been
led
their
chill
was
on
me
and
i
hugged
the
sunshine
the
duchess
s
apartments
are
beyond
said
the
old
man
he
was
the
oldest
man
i
had
ever
seen
so
sucked
back
into
the
past
that
he
seemed
more
like
a
memory
than
a
living
being
the
one
trait
linking
him
with
the
actual
was
the
fixity
with
which
his
small
saurian
eye
held
the
pocket
that
as
i
entered
had
yielded
a
to
the
s
child
he
went
on
without
removing
his
eye
for
two
hundred
years
nothing
has
been
changed
in
the
apartments
of
the
and
no
one
lives
here
now
no
one
sir
the
duke
goes
to
como
for
the
summer
i
had
moved
to
the
other
end
of
the
loggia
below
me
through
hanging
groves
white
roofs
and
domes
flashed
like
a
smile
and
that
s
vicenza
the
old
man
extended
fingers
as
lean
as
the
hands
fading
from
the
walls
behind
us
you
see
the
palace
roof
over
there
just
to
the
left
of
the
basilica
the
one
with
the
row
of
statues
like
birds
taking
flight
that
s
the
duke
s
town
palace
built
by
and
does
the
duke
come
there
never
in
winter
he
goes
to
and
the
palace
and
the
villa
are
always
closed
as
you
see
how
long
has
this
been
since
i
can
i
looked
into
his
eyes
they
were
like
tarnished
metal
mirrors
reflecting
nothing
that
must
be
a
long
time
i
said
involuntarily
a
long
time
he
assented
i
looked
down
on
the
gardens
an
opulence
of
dahlias
overran
the
between
cypresses
that
cut
the
sunshine
like
basalt
shafts
bees
hung
above
the
lavender
lizards
sunned
themselves
on
the
benches
and
slipped
through
the
cracks
of
the
dry
basins
everywhere
were
vanishing
traces
of
that
fantastic
horticulture
of
which
our
dull
age
has
lost
the
art
down
the
alleys
maimed
statues
stretched
their
arms
like
rows
of
whining
beggars
terms
grinned
in
the
thickets
and
above
the
laurustinus
walls
rose
the
mock
ruin
of
a
temple
falling
into
real
ruin
in
the
bright
disintegrating
air
the
glare
was
blinding
let
us
go
in
i
said
the
old
man
pushed
open
a
heavy
door
behind
which
the
cold
lurked
like
a
knife
the
duchess
s
apartments
he
said
overhead
and
around
us
the
same
evanescent
frescoes
under
foot
the
same
scagliola
volutes
unrolled
themselves
interminably
ebony
cabinets
with
inlay
of
precious
marbles
in
cunning
perspective
alternated
down
the
room
with
the
tarnished
efflorescence
of
gilt
consoles
supporting
chinese
monsters
and
from
the
a
gentleman
in
the
spanish
habit
haughtily
ignored
us
duke
ercole
the
old
man
explained
by
the
genoese
it
was
a
face
sallow
as
a
wax
effigy
and
as
though
modelled
by
priestly
hands
the
lips
weak
and
vain
rather
than
cruel
a
quibbling
mouth
that
would
have
snapped
at
verbal
errors
like
a
lizard
catching
flies
but
had
never
learned
the
shape
of
a
round
yes
or
no
one
of
the
duke
s
hands
rested
on
the
head
of
a
dwarf
a
simian
creature
with
pearl
and
fantastic
dress
the
other
turned
the
pages
of
a
folio
propped
on
a
skull
beyond
is
the
duchess
s
bedroom
the
old
man
reminded
me
here
the
shutters
admitted
but
two
narrow
shafts
of
light
gold
bars
deepening
the
subaqueous
gloom
on
a
dais
the
bedstead
grim
nuptial
official
lifted
its
baldachin
a
yellow
christ
agonized
between
the
curtains
and
across
the
room
a
lady
smiled
at
us
from
the
the
old
man
unbarred
a
shutter
and
the
light
touched
her
face
such
a
face
it
was
with
a
flicker
of
laughter
over
it
like
the
wind
on
a
june
meadow
and
a
singular
tender
pliancy
of
mien
as
though
one
of
tiepolo
s
lenient
goddesses
had
been
busked
into
the
stiff
sheath
of
a
seventeenth
century
dress
no
one
has
slept
here
said
the
old
man
since
the
duchess
and
she
was
the
lady
there
first
duchess
of
duke
ercole
he
drew
a
key
from
his
pocket
and
unlocked
a
door
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
the
chapel
he
said
this
is
the
duchess
s
as
i
turned
to
follow
him
the
duchess
tossed
me
a
sidelong
smile
i
stepped
into
a
grated
tribune
above
a
chapel
festooned
with
stucco
pictures
of
bituminous
saints
mouldered
between
the
pilasters
the
artificial
roses
in
the
were
gray
with
dust
and
age
and
under
the
cobwebby
rosettes
of
the
vaulting
a
bird
s
nest
clung
before
the
altar
stood
a
row
of
tattered
and
i
drew
back
at
sight
of
a
figure
kneeling
near
them
the
duchess
the
old
man
whispered
by
the
cavaliere
it
was
the
image
of
a
woman
in
furred
robes
and
spreading
fraise
her
hand
lifted
her
face
addressed
to
the
tabernacle
there
was
a
strangeness
in
the
sight
of
that
immovable
presence
locked
in
prayer
before
an
abandoned
shrine
her
face
was
hidden
and
i
wondered
whether
it
were
grief
or
gratitude
that
raised
her
hands
and
drew
her
eyes
to
the
altar
where
no
living
prayer
joined
her
marble
invocation
i
followed
my
guide
down
the
tribune
steps
impatient
to
see
what
mystic
version
of
such
terrestrial
graces
the
ingenious
artist
had
found
the
cavaliere
was
master
of
such
arts
the
duchess
s
attitude
was
one
of
transport
as
though
heavenly
airs
fluttered
her
laces
and
the
escaping
from
her
coif
i
saw
how
admirably
the
sculptor
had
caught
the
poise
of
her
head
the
tender
slope
of
the
shoulder
then
i
crossed
over
and
looked
into
her
face
it
was
a
frozen
horror
never
have
hate
revolt
and
agony
so
possessed
a
human
countenance
the
old
man
crossed
himself
and
shuffled
his
feet
on
the
marble
the
duchess
violante
he
repeated
the
same
as
in
the
picture
eh
the
but
the
face
what
does
it
mean
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
turned
deaf
eyes
on
me
then
he
shot
a
glance
round
the
sepulchral
place
clutched
my
sleeve
and
said
close
to
my
ear
it
was
not
always
what
was
not
the
face
so
the
duchess
s
face
the
statue
s
it
changed
after
after
it
was
put
the
statue
s
face
he
mistook
my
bewilderment
for
incredulity
and
his
confidential
finger
dropped
from
my
sleeve
eh
that
s
the
story
i
tell
what
i
ve
heard
what
do
i
know
he
resumed
his
senile
shuffle
across
the
marble
this
is
a
bad
place
to
stay
in
no
one
comes
here
it
s
too
cold
but
the
gentleman
said
must
see
i
let
the
sound
so
i
must
and
hear
everything
this
story
now
from
whom
did
you
have
it
his
hand
stole
back
one
that
saw
it
by
god
that
saw
it
my
grandmother
then
i
m
a
very
old
your
grandmother
your
grandmother
was
the
duchess
s
serving
girl
with
respect
to
your
grandmother
two
hundred
years
ago
is
it
too
long
ago
that
s
as
god
pleases
i
am
a
very
old
man
and
she
was
a
very
old
woman
when
i
was
born
when
she
died
she
was
as
black
as
a
miraculous
virgin
and
her
breath
whistled
like
the
wind
in
a
keyhole
she
told
me
the
story
when
i
was
a
little
boy
she
told
it
to
me
out
there
in
the
garden
on
a
bench
by
the
one
summer
night
of
the
year
she
died
it
must
be
true
for
i
can
show
you
the
very
bench
we
sat
on
iii
noon
lay
heavier
on
the
gardens
not
our
live
humming
warmth
but
the
stale
exhalation
of
dead
summers
the
very
statues
seemed
to
drowse
like
watchers
by
a
lizards
shot
out
of
the
cracked
soil
like
flames
and
the
bench
in
the
was
strewn
with
the
blue
varnished
bodies
of
dead
flies
before
us
lay
the
a
yellow
marble
slab
above
rotting
secrets
the
villa
looked
across
it
composed
as
a
dead
face
with
the
cypresses
flanking
it
for
candles
iv
impossible
you
say
that
my
mother
s
mother
should
have
been
the
duchess
s
maid
what
do
i
know
it
is
so
long
since
anything
has
happened
here
that
the
old
things
seem
nearer
perhaps
than
to
those
who
live
in
cities
but
how
else
did
she
know
about
the
statue
then
answer
me
that
sir
that
she
saw
with
her
eyes
i
can
swear
to
and
never
smiled
again
so
she
told
me
till
they
put
her
first
child
in
her
arms
for
she
was
taken
to
wife
by
the
steward
s
son
antonio
the
same
who
had
carried
the
letters
but
where
am
i
ah
well
she
was
a
mere
slip
you
understand
my
grandmother
when
the
duchess
died
a
niece
of
the
upper
maid
nencia
and
suffered
about
the
duchess
because
of
her
pranks
and
the
funny
songs
she
knew
it
s
possible
you
think
she
may
have
heard
from
others
what
she
afterward
fancied
she
had
seen
herself
how
that
is
it
s
not
for
an
unlettered
man
to
say
though
indeed
i
myself
seem
to
have
seen
many
of
the
things
she
told
me
this
is
a
strange
place
no
one
comes
here
nothing
changes
and
the
old
memories
stand
up
as
distinct
as
the
statues
in
the
garden
it
began
the
summer
after
they
came
back
from
the
brenta
duke
ercole
had
married
the
lady
from
venice
you
must
know
it
was
a
gay
city
then
i
m
told
with
laughter
and
music
on
the
water
and
the
days
slipped
by
like
boats
running
with
the
tide
well
to
humor
her
he
took
her
back
the
first
autumn
to
the
brenta
her
father
it
appears
had
a
grand
palace
there
with
such
gardens
grottoes
and
casinos
as
never
were
gondolas
bobbing
at
the
a
stable
full
of
gilt
coaches
a
theatre
full
of
players
and
kitchens
and
offices
full
of
cooks
and
lackeys
to
serve
up
chocolate
all
day
long
to
the
fine
ladies
in
masks
and
furbelows
with
their
pet
dogs
and
their
blackamoors
and
their
eh
i
know
it
all
as
if
i
d
been
there
for
nencia
you
see
my
grandmother
s
aunt
travelled
with
the
duchess
and
came
back
with
her
eyes
round
as
platters
and
not
a
word
to
say
for
the
rest
of
the
year
to
any
of
the
lads
who
d
courted
her
here
in
vicenza
what
happened
there
i
don
t
know
my
grandmother
could
never
get
at
the
rights
of
it
for
nencia
was
mute
as
a
fish
where
her
lady
was
concerned
but
when
they
came
back
to
vicenza
the
duke
ordered
the
villa
set
in
order
and
in
the
spring
he
brought
the
duchess
here
and
left
her
she
looked
happy
enough
my
grandmother
said
and
seemed
no
object
for
pity
perhaps
after
all
it
was
better
than
being
shut
up
in
vicenza
in
the
tall
painted
rooms
where
priests
came
and
went
as
softly
as
cats
prowling
for
birds
and
the
duke
was
forever
closeted
in
his
library
talking
with
learned
men
the
duke
was
a
scholar
you
noticed
he
was
painted
with
a
book
well
those
that
can
read
em
make
out
that
they
re
full
of
wonderful
things
as
a
man
that
s
been
to
a
fair
across
the
mountains
will
always
tell
his
people
at
home
it
was
beyond
anything
ever
see
as
for
the
duchess
she
was
all
for
music
and
young
company
the
duke
was
a
silent
man
stepping
quietly
with
his
eyes
down
as
though
he
d
just
come
from
confession
when
the
duchess
s
yapped
at
his
heels
he
danced
like
a
man
in
a
swarm
of
hornets
when
the
duchess
laughed
he
winced
as
if
you
d
drawn
a
diamond
across
a
and
the
duchess
was
always
laughing
when
she
first
came
to
the
villa
she
was
very
busy
laying
out
the
gardens
designing
grottoes
planting
groves
and
planning
all
manner
of
agreeable
surprises
in
the
way
of
that
drenched
you
unexpectedly
and
hermits
in
caves
and
wild
men
that
jumped
at
you
out
of
thickets
she
had
a
very
pretty
taste
in
such
matters
but
after
a
while
she
tired
of
it
and
there
being
no
one
for
her
to
talk
to
but
her
maids
and
the
chaplain
a
clumsy
man
deep
in
his
books
why
she
would
have
strolling
players
out
from
vicenza
mountebanks
and
from
the
travelling
doctors
and
astrologers
and
all
manner
of
trained
animals
still
it
could
be
seen
that
the
poor
lady
pined
for
company
and
her
waiting
women
who
loved
her
were
glad
when
the
cavaliere
ascanio
the
duke
s
cousin
came
to
live
at
the
vineyard
across
the
valley
you
see
the
pinkish
house
over
there
in
the
mulberries
with
a
red
roof
and
a
the
cavaliere
ascanio
was
a
cadet
of
one
of
the
great
venetian
houses
of
the
golden
book
he
had
been
meant
for
the
church
i
believe
but
what
he
set
fighting
above
praying
and
cast
in
his
lot
with
the
captain
of
the
duke
of
mantua
s
himself
a
venetian
of
good
standing
but
a
little
at
odds
with
the
law
well
the
next
i
know
the
cavaliere
was
in
venice
again
perhaps
not
in
good
odor
on
account
of
his
connection
with
the
gentleman
i
speak
of
some
say
he
tried
to
carry
off
a
nun
from
the
convent
of
santa
croce
how
that
may
be
i
can
t
say
but
my
grandmother
declared
he
had
enemies
there
and
the
end
of
it
was
that
on
some
pretext
or
other
the
ten
banished
him
to
vicenza
there
of
course
the
duke
being
his
kinsman
had
to
show
him
a
civil
face
and
that
was
how
he
first
came
to
the
villa
he
was
a
fine
young
man
beautiful
as
a
saint
sebastian
a
rare
musician
who
sang
his
own
songs
to
the
lute
in
a
way
that
used
to
make
my
grandmother
s
heart
melt
and
run
through
her
body
like
mulled
wine
he
had
a
good
word
for
everybody
too
and
was
always
dressed
in
the
french
fashion
and
smelt
as
sweet
as
a
and
every
soul
about
the
place
welcomed
the
sight
of
him
well
the
duchess
it
seemed
welcomed
it
too
youth
will
have
youth
and
laughter
turns
to
laughter
and
the
two
matched
each
other
like
the
candlesticks
on
an
altar
the
duchess
you
ve
seen
her
portrait
but
to
hear
my
grandmother
sir
it
no
more
approached
her
than
a
weed
comes
up
to
a
rose
the
cavaliere
indeed
as
became
a
poet
paragoned
her
in
his
song
to
all
the
pagan
goddesses
of
antiquity
and
doubtless
these
were
finer
to
look
at
than
mere
women
but
so
it
seemed
was
she
for
to
believe
my
grandmother
she
made
other
women
look
no
more
than
the
big
french
that
used
to
be
shown
on
ascension
days
in
the
piazza
she
was
one
at
any
rate
that
needed
no
outlandish
finery
to
beautify
her
whatever
dress
she
wore
became
her
as
feathers
fit
the
bird
and
her
hair
didn
t
get
its
color
by
bleaching
on
the
housetop
it
glittered
of
itself
like
the
threads
in
an
easter
chasuble
and
her
skin
was
whiter
than
fine
wheaten
bread
and
her
mouth
as
sweet
as
a
ripe
fig
well
sir
you
could
no
more
keep
them
apart
than
the
bees
and
the
lavender
they
were
always
together
singing
bowling
playing
cup
and
ball
walking
in
the
gardens
visiting
the
aviaries
and
petting
her
grace
s
and
monkeys
the
duchess
was
as
gay
as
a
foal
always
playing
pranks
and
laughing
tricking
out
her
animals
like
comedians
disguising
herself
as
a
peasant
or
a
nun
you
should
have
seen
her
one
day
pass
herself
off
to
the
chaplain
as
a
mendicant
sister
or
teaching
the
lads
and
girls
of
the
vineyards
to
dance
and
sing
madrigals
together
the
cavaliere
had
a
singular
ingenuity
in
planning
such
entertainments
and
the
days
were
hardly
long
enough
for
their
diversions
but
toward
the
end
of
the
summer
the
duchess
fell
quiet
and
would
hear
only
sad
music
and
the
two
sat
much
together
in
the
gazebo
at
the
end
of
the
garden
it
was
there
the
duke
found
them
one
day
when
he
drove
out
from
vicenza
in
his
gilt
coach
he
came
but
once
or
twice
a
year
to
the
villa
and
it
was
as
my
grandmother
said
just
a
part
of
her
poor
lady
s
to
be
wearing
that
day
the
venetian
habit
which
uncovered
the
shoulders
in
a
way
the
duke
always
scowled
at
and
her
curls
loose
and
powdered
with
gold
well
the
three
drank
chocolate
in
the
gazebo
and
what
happened
no
one
knew
except
that
the
duke
on
taking
leave
gave
his
cousin
a
seat
in
his
carriage
but
the
cavaliere
never
returned
winter
approaching
and
the
poor
lady
thus
finding
herself
once
more
alone
it
was
surmised
among
her
women
that
she
must
fall
into
a
deeper
depression
of
spirits
but
far
from
this
being
the
case
she
displayed
such
cheerfulness
and
equanimity
of
humor
that
my
grandmother
for
one
was
with
her
for
giving
no
more
thought
to
the
poor
young
man
who
all
this
time
was
eating
his
heart
out
in
the
house
across
the
valley
it
is
true
she
quitted
her
gowns
and
wore
a
veil
over
her
head
but
nencia
would
have
it
she
looked
the
lovelier
for
the
change
and
so
gave
the
duke
greater
displeasure
certain
it
is
that
the
duke
drove
out
oftener
to
the
villa
and
though
he
found
his
lady
always
engaged
in
some
innocent
pursuit
such
as
embroidery
or
music
or
playing
games
with
her
young
women
yet
he
always
went
away
with
a
sour
look
and
a
whispered
word
to
the
chaplain
now
as
to
the
chaplain
my
grandmother
owned
there
had
been
a
time
when
her
grace
had
not
handled
him
for
according
to
nencia
it
seems
that
his
reverence
who
seldom
approached
the
duchess
being
buried
in
his
library
like
a
mouse
in
a
cheese
well
one
day
he
made
bold
to
appeal
to
her
for
a
sum
of
money
a
large
sum
nencia
said
to
buy
certain
tall
books
a
chest
full
of
them
that
a
foreign
pedlar
had
brought
him
whereupon
the
duchess
who
could
never
abide
a
book
breaks
out
at
him
with
a
laugh
and
a
flash
of
her
old
spirit
holy
mother
of
god
must
i
have
more
books
about
me
i
was
nearly
smothered
with
them
in
the
first
year
of
my
marriage
and
the
chaplain
turning
red
at
the
affront
she
added
you
may
buy
them
and
welcome
my
good
chaplain
if
you
can
find
the
money
but
as
for
me
i
am
yet
seeking
a
way
to
pay
for
my
turquoise
necklace
and
the
statue
of
daphne
at
the
end
of
the
and
the
indian
parrot
that
my
black
boy
brought
me
last
michaelmas
from
the
bohemians
so
you
see
i
ve
no
money
to
waste
on
trifles
and
as
he
backs
out
awkwardly
she
tosses
at
him
over
her
shoulder
you
should
pray
to
saint
blandina
to
open
the
duke
s
pocket
to
which
he
returned
very
quietly
your
excellency
s
suggestion
is
an
admirable
one
and
i
have
already
entreated
that
blessed
martyr
to
open
the
duke
s
thereat
nencia
said
who
was
standing
by
the
duchess
flushed
wonderfully
red
and
waved
him
out
of
the
room
and
then
quick
she
cried
to
my
grandmother
who
was
too
glad
to
run
on
such
errands
call
me
antonio
the
gardener
s
boy
to
the
i
ve
a
word
to
say
to
him
about
the
new
now
i
may
not
have
told
you
sir
that
in
the
crypt
under
the
chapel
there
has
stood
for
more
generations
than
a
man
can
count
a
stone
coffin
containing
a
thighbone
of
the
blessed
saint
blandina
of
lyons
a
relic
offered
i
ve
been
told
by
some
great
duke
of
france
to
one
of
our
own
dukes
when
they
fought
the
turk
together
and
the
object
ever
since
of
particular
veneration
in
this
illustrious
family
now
since
the
duchess
had
been
left
to
herself
it
was
observed
she
affected
a
fervent
devotion
to
this
relic
praying
often
in
the
chapel
and
even
causing
the
stone
slab
that
covered
the
entrance
to
the
crypt
to
be
replaced
by
a
wooden
one
that
she
might
at
will
descend
and
kneel
by
the
coffin
this
was
matter
of
edification
to
all
the
household
and
should
have
been
peculiarly
pleasing
to
the
chaplain
but
with
respect
to
you
he
was
the
kind
of
man
who
brings
a
sour
mouth
to
the
eating
of
the
sweetest
apple
however
that
may
be
the
duchess
when
she
dismissed
him
was
seen
running
to
the
garden
where
she
talked
earnestly
with
the
boy
antonio
about
the
new
and
the
rest
of
the
day
she
sat
indoors
and
played
sweetly
on
the
virginal
now
nencia
always
had
it
in
mind
that
her
grace
had
made
a
mistake
in
refusing
that
request
of
the
chaplain
s
but
she
said
nothing
for
to
talk
reason
to
the
duchess
was
of
no
more
use
than
praying
for
rain
in
a
drought
winter
came
early
that
year
there
was
snow
on
the
hills
by
all
souls
the
wind
stripped
the
gardens
and
the
were
nipped
in
the
the
duchess
kept
her
room
in
this
black
season
sitting
over
the
fire
embroidering
reading
books
of
devotion
which
was
a
thing
she
had
never
done
and
praying
frequently
in
the
chapel
as
for
the
chaplain
it
was
a
place
he
never
set
foot
in
but
to
say
mass
in
the
morning
with
the
duchess
overhead
in
the
tribune
and
the
servants
aching
with
rheumatism
on
the
marble
floor
the
chaplain
himself
hated
the
cold
and
galloped
through
the
mass
like
a
man
with
witches
after
him
the
rest
of
the
day
he
spent
in
his
library
over
a
brazier
with
his
eternal
books
you
ll
wonder
sir
if
i
m
ever
to
get
to
the
gist
of
the
story
and
i
ve
gone
slowly
i
own
for
fear
of
what
s
coming
well
the
winter
was
long
and
hard
when
it
fell
cold
the
duke
ceased
to
come
out
from
vicenza
and
not
a
soul
had
the
duchess
to
speak
to
but
her
and
the
gardeners
about
the
place
yet
it
was
wonderful
my
grandmother
said
how
she
kept
her
brave
colors
and
her
spirits
only
it
was
remarked
that
she
prayed
longer
in
the
chapel
where
a
brazier
was
kept
burning
for
her
all
day
when
the
young
are
denied
their
natural
pleasures
they
turn
often
enough
to
religion
and
it
was
a
mercy
as
my
grandmother
said
that
she
who
had
scarce
a
live
sinner
to
speak
to
should
take
such
comfort
in
a
dead
saint
my
grandmother
seldom
saw
her
that
winter
for
though
she
showed
a
brave
front
to
all
she
kept
more
and
more
to
herself
choosing
to
have
only
nencia
about
her
and
dismissing
even
her
when
she
went
to
pray
for
her
devotion
had
that
mark
of
true
piety
that
she
wished
it
not
to
be
observed
so
that
nencia
had
strict
orders
on
the
chaplain
s
approach
to
warn
her
mistress
if
she
happened
to
be
in
prayer
well
the
winter
passed
and
spring
was
well
forward
when
my
grandmother
one
evening
had
a
bad
fright
that
it
was
her
own
fault
i
won
t
deny
for
she
d
been
down
the
with
antonio
when
her
aunt
fancied
her
to
be
stitching
in
her
chamber
and
seeing
a
sudden
light
in
nencia
s
window
she
took
fright
lest
her
disobedience
be
found
out
and
ran
up
quickly
through
the
to
the
house
her
way
lay
by
the
chapel
and
as
she
crept
past
it
meaning
to
slip
in
through
the
scullery
and
groping
her
way
for
the
dark
had
fallen
and
the
moon
was
scarce
up
she
heard
a
crash
close
behind
her
as
though
someone
had
dropped
from
a
window
of
the
chapel
the
young
fool
s
heart
turned
over
but
she
looked
round
as
she
ran
and
there
sure
enough
was
a
man
scuttling
across
the
terrace
and
as
he
doubled
the
corner
of
the
house
my
grandmother
swore
she
caught
the
whisk
of
the
chaplain
s
skirts
now
that
was
a
strange
thing
certainly
for
why
should
the
chaplain
be
getting
out
of
the
chapel
window
when
he
might
have
passed
through
the
door
for
you
may
have
noticed
sir
there
s
a
door
leads
from
the
chapel
into
the
saloon
on
the
ground
floor
the
only
other
way
out
being
through
the
duchess
s
tribune
well
my
grandmother
turned
the
matter
over
and
next
time
she
met
antonio
in
the
which
by
reason
of
her
fright
was
not
for
some
days
she
laid
before
him
what
had
happened
but
to
her
surprise
he
only
laughed
and
said
you
little
simpleton
he
wasn
t
getting
out
of
the
window
he
was
trying
to
look
in
and
not
another
word
could
she
get
from
him
so
the
season
moved
on
to
easter
and
news
came
the
duke
had
gone
to
rome
for
that
holy
festivity
his
comings
and
goings
made
no
change
at
the
villa
and
yet
there
was
no
one
there
but
felt
easier
to
think
his
yellow
face
was
on
the
far
side
of
the
apennines
unless
perhaps
it
was
the
chaplain
well
it
was
one
day
in
may
that
the
duchess
who
had
walked
long
with
nencia
on
the
terrace
rejoicing
at
the
sweetness
of
the
prospect
and
the
pleasant
scent
of
the
in
the
stone
vases
the
duchess
toward
midday
withdrew
to
her
rooms
giving
orders
that
her
dinner
should
be
served
in
her
my
grandmother
helped
to
carry
in
the
dishes
and
observed
she
said
the
singular
beauty
of
the
duchess
who
in
honor
of
the
fine
weather
had
put
on
a
gown
of
and
hung
her
bare
shoulders
with
pearls
so
that
she
looked
fit
to
dance
at
court
with
an
emperor
she
had
ordered
too
a
rare
repast
for
a
lady
that
heeded
so
little
what
she
ate
jellies
fruits
in
syrup
spiced
cakes
and
a
flagon
of
greek
wine
and
she
nodded
and
clapped
her
hands
as
the
women
set
it
before
her
saying
again
and
again
i
shall
eat
well
but
presently
another
mood
seized
her
she
turned
from
the
table
called
for
her
rosary
and
said
to
nencia
the
fine
weather
has
made
me
neglect
my
devotions
i
must
say
a
litany
before
i
she
ordered
the
women
out
and
barred
the
door
as
her
custom
was
and
nencia
and
my
grandmother
went
to
work
in
the
now
the
gives
on
the
and
suddenly
my
grandmother
saw
a
strange
sight
approaching
first
up
the
avenue
came
the
duke
s
carriage
whom
all
thought
to
be
in
rome
and
after
it
drawn
by
a
long
string
of
mules
and
oxen
a
cart
carrying
what
looked
like
a
kneeling
figure
wrapped
in
the
strangeness
of
it
struck
the
girl
dumb
and
the
duke
s
coach
was
at
the
door
before
she
had
the
wit
to
cry
out
that
it
was
coming
nencia
when
she
saw
it
went
white
and
ran
out
of
the
room
my
grandmother
followed
scared
by
her
face
and
the
two
fled
along
the
corridor
to
the
chapel
on
the
way
they
met
the
chaplain
deep
in
a
book
who
asked
in
surprise
where
they
were
running
and
when
they
said
to
announce
the
duke
s
arrival
he
fell
into
such
astonishment
and
asked
them
so
many
questions
and
uttered
such
ohs
and
ahs
that
by
the
time
he
let
them
by
the
duke
was
at
their
heels
nencia
reached
the
first
and
cried
out
that
the
duke
was
coming
and
before
she
had
a
reply
he
was
at
her
side
with
the
chaplain
following
a
moment
later
the
door
opened
and
there
stood
the
duchess
she
held
her
rosary
in
one
hand
and
had
drawn
a
scarf
over
her
shoulders
but
they
shone
through
it
like
the
moon
in
a
mist
and
her
countenance
sparkled
with
beauty
the
duke
took
her
hand
with
a
bow
madam
he
said
i
could
have
had
no
greater
happiness
than
thus
to
surprise
you
at
your
my
own
happiness
she
replied
would
have
been
greater
had
your
excellency
prolonged
it
by
giving
me
notice
of
your
had
you
expected
me
madam
said
he
your
appearance
could
scarcely
have
been
more
fitted
to
the
occasion
few
ladies
of
your
youth
and
beauty
array
themselves
to
venerate
a
saint
as
they
would
to
welcome
a
sir
she
answered
having
never
enjoyed
the
latter
opportunity
i
am
constrained
to
make
the
most
of
the
what
s
that
she
cried
falling
back
and
the
rosary
dropped
from
her
hand
there
was
a
loud
noise
at
the
other
end
of
the
saloon
as
of
a
heavy
object
being
dragged
down
the
passage
and
presently
a
dozen
men
were
seen
haling
across
the
threshold
the
shrouded
thing
from
the
oxcart
the
duke
waved
his
hand
toward
it
that
said
he
madam
is
a
tribute
to
your
extraordinary
piety
i
have
heard
with
peculiar
satisfaction
of
your
devotion
to
the
blessed
relics
in
this
chapel
and
to
commemorate
a
zeal
which
neither
the
rigors
of
winter
nor
the
sultriness
of
summer
could
abate
i
have
ordered
a
sculptured
image
of
you
marvellously
executed
by
the
cavaliere
bernini
to
be
placed
before
the
altar
over
the
entrance
to
the
the
duchess
who
had
grown
pale
nevertheless
smiled
playfully
at
this
as
to
commemorating
my
piety
she
said
i
recognize
there
one
of
your
excellency
s
pleasantries
a
pleasantry
the
duke
interrupted
and
he
made
a
sign
to
the
men
who
had
now
reached
the
threshold
of
the
chapel
in
an
instant
the
wrappings
fell
from
the
figure
and
there
knelt
the
duchess
to
the
life
a
cry
of
wonder
rose
from
all
but
the
duchess
herself
stood
whiter
than
the
marble
you
will
see
says
the
duke
this
is
no
pleasantry
but
a
triumph
of
the
incomparable
bernini
s
chisel
the
likeness
was
done
from
your
miniature
portrait
by
the
divine
elisabetta
sirani
which
i
sent
to
the
master
some
six
months
ago
with
what
results
all
must
six
months
cried
the
duchess
and
seemed
about
to
fall
but
his
excellency
caught
her
by
the
hand
nothing
he
said
could
better
please
me
than
the
excessive
emotion
you
display
for
true
piety
is
ever
modest
and
your
thanks
could
not
take
a
form
that
better
became
you
and
now
says
he
to
the
men
let
the
image
be
put
in
by
this
life
seemed
to
have
returned
to
the
duchess
and
she
answered
him
with
a
deep
reverence
that
i
should
be
overcome
by
so
unexpected
a
grace
your
excellency
admits
to
be
natural
but
what
honors
you
accord
it
is
my
privilege
to
accept
and
i
entreat
only
that
in
mercy
to
my
modesty
the
image
be
placed
in
the
remotest
part
of
the
at
that
the
duke
darkened
what
you
would
have
this
masterpiece
of
a
renowned
chisel
which
i
disguise
not
cost
me
the
price
of
a
good
vineyard
in
gold
pieces
you
would
have
it
thrust
out
of
sight
like
the
work
of
a
village
stonecutter
it
is
my
semblance
not
the
sculptor
s
work
i
desire
to
it
you
are
fit
for
my
house
madam
you
are
fit
for
god
s
and
entitled
to
the
place
of
honor
in
both
bring
the
statue
forward
you
dawdlers
he
called
out
to
the
men
the
duchess
fell
back
submissively
you
are
right
sir
as
always
but
i
would
at
least
have
the
image
stand
on
the
left
of
the
altar
that
looking
up
it
may
behold
your
excellency
s
seat
in
the
a
pretty
thought
madam
for
which
i
thank
you
but
i
design
before
long
to
put
my
companion
image
on
the
other
side
of
the
altar
and
the
wife
s
place
as
you
know
is
at
her
husband
s
right
true
my
lord
but
again
if
my
poor
presentment
is
to
have
the
unmerited
honor
of
kneeling
beside
yours
why
not
place
both
before
the
altar
where
it
is
our
habit
to
pray
in
life
and
where
madam
should
we
kneel
if
they
took
our
places
besides
says
the
duke
still
speaking
very
blandly
i
have
a
more
particular
purpose
in
placing
your
image
over
the
entrance
to
the
crypt
for
not
only
would
i
thereby
mark
your
special
devotion
to
the
blessed
saint
who
rests
there
but
by
sealing
up
the
opening
in
the
pavement
would
assure
the
perpetual
preservation
of
that
holy
martyr
s
bones
which
hitherto
have
been
too
thoughtlessly
exposed
to
sacrilegious
what
attempts
my
lord
cries
the
duchess
no
one
enters
this
chapel
without
my
so
i
have
understood
and
can
well
believe
from
what
i
have
learned
of
your
piety
yet
at
night
a
malefactor
might
break
in
through
a
window
madam
and
your
excellency
not
know
i
m
a
light
sleeper
said
the
duchess
the
duke
looked
at
her
gravely
indeed
said
he
a
bad
sign
at
your
age
i
must
see
that
you
are
provided
with
a
the
duchess
s
eyes
filled
you
would
deprive
me
then
of
the
consolation
of
visiting
those
venerable
relics
i
would
have
you
keep
eternal
guard
over
them
knowing
no
one
to
whose
care
they
may
more
fittingly
be
by
this
the
image
was
brought
close
to
the
wooden
slab
that
covered
the
entrance
to
the
crypt
when
the
duchess
springing
forward
placed
herself
in
the
way
sir
let
the
statue
be
put
in
place
and
suffer
me
to
say
a
last
prayer
beside
those
holy
the
duke
stepped
instantly
to
her
side
well
thought
madam
i
will
go
down
with
you
now
and
we
will
pray
sir
your
long
absences
have
alas
given
me
the
habit
of
solitary
devotion
and
i
confess
that
any
presence
is
madam
i
accept
your
rebuke
hitherto
it
is
true
the
duties
of
my
station
have
constrained
me
to
long
absences
but
henceforward
i
remain
with
you
while
you
live
shall
we
go
down
into
the
crypt
together
no
for
i
fear
for
your
excellency
s
ague
the
air
there
is
excessively
the
more
reason
you
should
no
longer
be
exposed
to
it
and
to
prevent
the
intemperance
of
your
zeal
i
will
at
once
make
the
place
the
duchess
at
this
fell
on
her
knees
on
the
slab
weeping
excessively
and
lifting
her
hands
to
heaven
oh
she
cried
you
are
cruel
sir
to
deprive
me
of
access
to
the
sacred
relics
that
have
enabled
me
to
support
with
resignation
the
solitude
to
which
your
excellency
s
duties
have
condemned
me
and
if
prayer
and
meditation
give
me
any
authority
to
pronounce
on
such
matters
suffer
me
to
warn
you
sir
that
i
fear
the
blessed
saint
blandina
will
punish
us
for
thus
abandoning
her
venerable
remains
the
duke
at
this
seemed
to
pause
for
he
was
a
pious
man
and
my
grandmother
thought
she
saw
him
exchange
a
glance
with
the
chaplain
who
stepping
timidly
forward
with
his
eyes
on
the
ground
said
there
is
indeed
much
wisdom
in
her
excellency
s
words
but
i
would
suggest
sir
that
her
pious
wish
might
be
met
and
the
saint
more
conspicuously
honored
by
transferring
the
relics
from
the
crypt
to
a
place
beneath
the
true
cried
the
duke
and
it
shall
be
done
at
but
thereat
the
duchess
rose
to
her
feet
with
a
terrible
look
no
she
cried
by
the
body
of
god
for
it
shall
not
be
said
that
after
your
excellency
has
chosen
to
deny
every
request
i
addressed
to
him
i
owe
his
consent
to
the
solicitation
of
another
the
chaplain
turned
red
and
the
duke
yellow
and
for
a
moment
neither
spoke
then
the
duke
said
here
are
words
enough
madam
do
you
wish
the
relics
brought
up
from
the
crypt
i
wish
nothing
that
i
owe
to
another
s
intervention
put
the
image
in
place
then
says
the
duke
furiously
and
handed
her
grace
to
a
chair
she
sat
there
my
grandmother
said
straight
as
an
arrow
her
hands
locked
her
head
high
her
eyes
on
the
duke
while
the
statue
was
dragged
to
its
place
then
she
stood
up
and
turned
away
as
she
passed
by
nencia
call
me
antonio
she
whispered
but
before
the
words
were
out
of
her
mouth
the
duke
stepped
between
them
madam
says
he
all
smiles
now
i
have
travelled
straight
from
rome
to
bring
you
the
sooner
this
proof
of
my
esteem
i
lay
last
night
at
monselice
and
have
been
on
the
road
since
daybreak
will
you
not
invite
me
to
supper
surely
my
lord
said
the
duchess
it
shall
be
laid
in
the
within
the
why
not
in
your
chamber
and
at
once
madam
since
i
believe
it
is
your
custom
to
sup
in
my
chamber
says
the
duchess
in
disorder
have
you
anything
against
it
he
asked
assuredly
not
sir
if
you
will
give
me
time
to
prepare
i
will
wait
in
your
cabinet
said
the
duke
at
that
said
my
grandmother
the
duchess
gave
one
look
as
the
souls
in
hell
may
have
looked
when
the
gates
closed
on
our
lord
then
she
called
nencia
and
passed
to
her
chamber
what
happened
there
my
grandmother
could
never
learn
but
that
the
duchess
in
great
haste
dressed
herself
with
extraordinary
splendor
powdering
her
hair
with
gold
painting
her
face
and
bosom
and
covering
herself
with
jewels
till
she
shone
like
our
lady
of
loreto
and
hardly
were
these
preparations
complete
when
the
duke
entered
from
the
cabinet
followed
by
the
servants
carrying
supper
thereupon
the
duchess
dismissed
nencia
and
what
follows
my
grandmother
learned
from
a
who
brought
up
the
dishes
and
waited
in
the
cabinet
for
only
the
duke
s
entered
the
well
according
to
this
boy
sir
who
was
looking
and
listening
with
his
whole
body
as
it
were
because
he
had
never
before
been
suffered
so
near
the
duchess
it
appears
that
the
noble
couple
sat
down
in
great
good
humor
the
duchess
playfully
reproving
her
husband
for
his
long
absence
while
the
duke
swore
that
to
look
so
beautiful
was
the
best
way
of
punishing
him
in
this
tone
the
talk
continued
with
such
gay
sallies
on
the
part
of
the
duchess
such
tender
advances
on
the
duke
s
that
the
lad
declared
they
were
for
all
the
world
like
a
pair
of
lovers
courting
on
a
summer
s
night
in
the
vineyard
and
so
it
went
till
the
servant
brought
in
the
mulled
wine
ah
the
duke
was
saying
at
that
moment
this
agreeable
evening
repays
me
for
the
many
dull
ones
i
have
spent
away
from
you
nor
do
i
remember
to
have
enjoyed
such
laughter
since
the
afternoon
last
year
when
we
drank
chocolate
in
the
gazebo
with
my
cousin
ascanio
and
that
reminds
me
he
said
is
my
cousin
in
good
health
i
have
no
reports
of
it
says
the
duchess
but
your
excellency
should
taste
these
figs
stewed
in
malmsey
i
am
in
the
mood
to
taste
whatever
you
offer
said
he
and
as
she
helped
him
to
the
figs
he
added
if
my
enjoyment
were
not
complete
as
it
is
i
could
almost
wish
my
cousin
ascanio
were
with
us
the
fellow
is
rare
good
company
at
supper
what
do
you
say
madam
i
hear
he
s
still
in
the
country
shall
we
send
for
him
to
join
us
ah
said
the
duchess
with
a
sigh
and
a
languishing
look
i
see
your
excellency
wearies
of
me
i
madam
ascanio
is
a
capital
good
fellow
but
to
my
mind
his
chief
merit
at
this
moment
is
his
absence
it
inclines
me
so
tenderly
to
him
that
by
god
i
could
empty
a
glass
to
his
good
with
that
the
duke
caught
up
his
goblet
and
signed
to
the
servant
to
fill
the
duchess
s
here
s
to
the
cousin
he
cried
standing
who
has
the
good
taste
to
stay
away
when
he
s
not
wanted
i
drink
to
his
very
long
life
and
you
madam
at
this
the
duchess
who
had
sat
staring
at
him
with
a
changed
face
rose
also
and
lifted
her
glass
to
her
lips
and
i
to
his
happy
death
says
she
in
a
wild
voice
and
as
she
spoke
the
empty
goblet
dropped
from
her
hand
and
she
fell
face
down
on
the
floor
the
duke
shouted
to
her
women
that
she
had
swooned
and
they
came
and
lifted
her
to
the
bed
she
suffered
horribly
all
night
nencia
said
twisting
herself
like
a
heretic
at
the
stake
but
without
a
word
escaping
her
the
duke
watched
by
her
and
toward
daylight
sent
for
the
chaplain
but
by
this
she
was
unconscious
and
her
teeth
being
locked
our
lord
s
body
could
not
be
passed
through
them
the
duke
announced
to
his
relations
that
his
lady
had
died
after
partaking
too
freely
of
spiced
wine
and
an
omelet
of
carp
s
roe
at
a
supper
she
had
prepared
in
honor
of
his
return
and
the
next
year
he
brought
home
a
new
duchess
who
gave
him
a
son
and
five
daughters
v
the
sky
had
turned
to
a
steel
gray
against
which
the
villa
stood
out
sallow
and
inscrutable
a
wind
strayed
through
the
gardens
loosening
here
and
there
a
yellow
leaf
from
the
sycamores
and
the
hills
across
the
valley
were
purple
as
and
the
statue
i
asked
ah
the
statue
well
sir
this
is
what
my
grandmother
told
me
here
on
this
very
bench
where
we
re
sitting
the
poor
child
who
worshipped
the
duchess
as
a
girl
of
her
years
will
worship
a
beautiful
kind
mistress
spent
a
night
of
horror
you
may
fancy
shut
out
from
her
lady
s
room
hearing
the
cries
that
came
from
it
and
seeing
as
she
crouched
in
her
corner
the
women
rush
to
and
fro
with
wild
looks
the
duke
s
lean
face
in
the
door
and
the
chaplain
skulking
in
the
antechamber
with
his
eyes
on
his
breviary
no
one
minded
her
that
night
or
the
next
morning
and
toward
dusk
when
it
became
known
the
duchess
was
no
more
the
poor
girl
felt
the
pious
wish
to
say
a
prayer
for
her
dead
mistress
she
crept
to
the
chapel
and
stole
in
unobserved
the
place
was
empty
and
dim
but
as
she
advanced
she
heard
a
low
moaning
and
coming
in
front
of
the
statue
she
saw
that
its
face
the
day
before
so
sweet
and
smiling
had
the
look
on
it
that
you
know
and
the
moaning
seemed
to
come
from
its
lips
my
grandmother
turned
cold
but
something
she
said
afterward
kept
her
from
calling
or
shrieking
out
and
she
turned
and
ran
from
the
place
in
the
passage
she
fell
in
a
swoon
and
when
she
came
to
her
senses
in
her
own
chamber
she
heard
that
the
duke
had
locked
the
chapel
door
and
forbidden
any
to
set
foot
there
the
place
was
never
opened
again
till
the
duke
died
some
ten
years
later
and
then
it
was
that
the
other
servants
going
in
with
the
new
heir
saw
for
the
first
time
the
horror
that
my
grandmother
had
kept
in
her
bosom
and
the
crypt
i
asked
has
it
never
been
opened
heaven
forbid
sir
cried
the
old
man
crossing
himself
was
it
not
the
duchess
s
express
wish
that
the
relics
should
not
be
disturbed
the
angel
at
the
grave
the
house
stood
a
few
yards
back
from
the
village
street
in
that
sometimes
cited
as
a
democratic
protest
against
standards
of
domestic
exclusiveness
this
candid
exposure
to
the
public
eye
is
more
probably
a
result
of
the
gregariousness
which
in
the
new
england
bosom
oddly
coexists
with
a
shrinking
from
direct
social
contact
most
of
the
inmates
of
such
houses
preferring
that
furtive
intercourse
which
is
the
result
of
observations
through
shuttered
windows
and
a
categorical
acquaintance
with
the
neighboring
the
house
however
faced
its
public
with
a
difference
for
sixty
years
it
had
written
itself
with
a
capital
letter
had
squared
itself
in
the
eye
of
an
admiring
nation
the
most
searching
inroads
of
village
intimacy
hardly
counted
in
a
household
that
opened
on
the
universe
and
a
lady
whose
was
at
any
moment
liable
to
be
rung
by
visitors
from
london
or
vienna
was
not
likely
to
flutter
when
she
observed
a
neighbor
stepping
the
solitary
inmate
of
the
anson
house
owed
this
induration
of
the
social
texture
to
the
most
conspicuous
accident
in
her
annals
the
fact
that
she
was
the
only
granddaughter
of
the
great
orestes
anson
she
had
been
born
as
it
were
into
a
museum
and
cradled
in
a
glass
case
with
a
label
the
first
foundations
of
her
consciousness
being
built
on
the
rock
of
her
grandfather
s
celebrity
to
a
little
girl
who
acquires
her
earliest
knowledge
of
literature
through
a
embellished
with
fragments
of
her
ancestor
s
prose
that
personage
necessarily
fills
an
heroic
space
in
the
foreground
of
life
to
communicate
with
one
s
past
through
the
impressive
medium
of
print
to
have
as
it
were
a
footing
in
every
library
in
the
country
and
an
acknowledged
kinship
with
that
clan
the
descendants
of
the
great
was
to
be
pledged
to
a
standard
of
manners
that
amazingly
simplified
the
lesser
relations
of
life
the
village
street
on
which
paulina
anson
s
youth
looked
out
led
to
all
the
capitals
of
europe
and
over
the
roads
of
intercommunication
unseen
caravans
bore
back
to
the
house
the
tribute
of
an
admiring
world
fate
seemed
to
have
taken
a
direct
share
in
fitting
paulina
for
her
part
as
the
custodian
of
this
historic
dwelling
it
had
long
been
secretly
regarded
as
a
visitation
by
the
great
man
s
family
that
he
had
left
no
son
and
that
his
daughters
were
not
the
ladies
themselves
were
the
first
to
lament
their
deficiency
to
own
that
nature
had
denied
them
the
gift
of
making
the
most
of
their
opportunities
a
profound
veneration
for
their
parent
and
an
unswerving
faith
in
his
doctrines
had
not
amended
their
congenital
incapacity
to
understand
what
he
had
written
laura
who
had
her
moments
of
mute
rebellion
against
destiny
had
sometimes
thought
how
much
easier
it
would
have
been
if
their
progenitor
had
been
a
poet
for
she
could
recite
with
feeling
portions
of
culprit
and
of
the
poems
of
hemans
and
phoebe
who
was
more
conspicuous
for
memory

imagination
kept
an
album
filled
with
but
the
great
man
was
a
philosopher
and
to
both
daughters
respiration
was
difficult
on
the
cloudy
heights
of
metaphysic
the
situation
would
have
been
intolerable
but
for
the
fact
that
while
phoebe
and
laura
were
still
at
school
their
father
s
fame
had
passed
from
the
open
ground
of
conjecture
to
the
chill
privacy
of
certitude
anson
had
in
fact
achieved
one
of
those
anticipated
immortalities
not
uncommon
at
a
time
when
people
were
apt
to
base
their
literary
judgments
on
their
emotions
and
when
to
affect
plain
food
and
despise
england
went
a
long
way
toward
establishing
a
man
s
intellectual
thus
when
the
daughters
were
called
on
to
strike
a
filial
attitude
about
their
parent
s
pedestal
there
was
little
to
do
but
to
pose
gracefully
and
point
upward
and
there
are
spines
to
which
the
immobility
of
worship
is
not
a
strain
a
legend
had
by
this
time
crystallized
about
the
great
orestes
and
it
was
of
more
immediate
interest
to
the
public
to
hear
what
brand
of
tea
he
drank
and
whether
he
took
off
his
boots
in
the
hall
than
to
rouse
the
drowsy
echo
of
his
dialectic
a
great
man
never
draws
so
near
his
public
as
when
it
has
become
unnecessary
to
read
his
books
and
is
still
interesting
to
know
what
he
eats
for
breakfast
as
recorders
of
their
parent
s
domestic
habits
as
pious
scavengers
of
his
basket
the
misses
anson
were
unexcelled
they
always
had
an
interesting
anecdote
to
impart
to
the
literary
pilgrim
and
the
tact
with
which
in
later
years
they
intervened
between
the
public
and
the
growing
inaccessibility
of
its
idol
sent
away
many
an
enthusiast
satisfied
to
have
touched
the
veil
before
the
sanctuary
still
it
was
felt
especially
by
old
anson
who
survived
her
husband
for
some
years
that
phoebe
and
laura
were
not
worthy
of
their
privileges
there
had
been
a
third
daughter
so
unworthy
of
hers
that
she
had
married
a
distant
cousin
who
had
taken
her
to
live
in
a
new
western
community
where
the
of
orestes
had
not
yet
become
a
part
of
the
civic
consciousness
but
of
this
daughter
little
was
said
and
she
was
tacitly
understood
to
be
excluded
from
the
family
heritage
of
fame
in
time
however
it
appeared
that
the
traditional
penny
with
which
she
had
been
cut
off
had
been
invested
to
unexpected
advantage
and
the
interest
on
it
when
she
died
returned
to
the
anson
house
in
the
shape
of
a
granddaughter
who
was
at
once
felt
to
be
what
anson
called
a
it
was
anson
s
firm
belief
that
the
remotest
operations
of
nature
were
governed
by
the
centripetal
force
of
her
husband
s
greatness
and
that
paulina
s
exceptional
intelligence
could
be
explained
only
on
the
ground
that
she
was
designed
to
act
as
the
guardian
of
the
family
temple
the
house
by
the
time
paulina
came
to
live
in
it
had
already
acquired
the
publicity
of
a
place
of
worship
not
the
perfumed
chapel
of
a
romantic
idolatry
but
the
cold
clean
empty
of
ethical
enthusiasms
the
ladies
lived
on
its
outskirts
as
it
were
in
cells
that
left
the
central
fane
undisturbed
the
very
position
of
the
furniture
had
come
to
have
a
ritual
significance
the
sparse
ornaments
were
the
offerings
of
kindred
intellects
the
steel
engravings
by
raphael
morghen
marked
the
via
sacra
of
a
european
tour
and
the
desk
with
its
bronze
inkstand
modelled
on
the
pantheon
was
the
altar
of
this
bleak
temple
of
thought
to
a
child
compact
of
enthusiasms
and
accustomed
to
pasture
them
on
the
scanty
herbage
of
a
new
social
soil
the
atmosphere
of
the
old
house
was
full
of
floating
nourishment
in
the
compressed
perspective
of
paulina
s
outlook
it
stood
for
a
monument
of
ruined
civilizations
and
its
white
portico
opened
on
legendary
distances
its
very
aspect
was
impressive
to
eyes
that
had
first
surveyed
life
from
the
residence
of
a
western
town
the
rooms
with
their
panelled
walls
their
polished
mahogany
their
portraits
of
ancestors
and
of
ringleted
females
in
crayon
furnished
the
child
with
the
historic
scenery
against
which
a
young
imagination
constructs
its
vision
of
the
past
to
other
eyes
the
cold
spotless
interior
might
have
suggested
the
shuttered
mind
of
a
who
associates
fresh
air
and
sunlight
with
dust
and
discoloration
but
it
is
the
eye
which
supplies
the
and
paulina
s
brimmed
with
the
richest
hues
nevertheless
the
house
did
not
immediately
dominate
her
she
had
her
confused
toward
other
centres
of
sensation
her
vague
intuition
of
a
heliocentric
system
but
the
attraction
of
habit
the
steady
pressure
of
example
gradually
fixed
her
roving
allegiance
and
she
bent
her
neck
to
the
yoke
vanity
had
a
share
in
her
subjugation
for
it
had
early
been
discovered
that
she
was
the
only
person
in
the
family
who
could
read
her
grandfather
s
works
the
fact
that
she
had
perused
them
with
delight
at
an
age
when
even
presupposing
a
metaphysical
bias
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
understand
them
seemed
to
her
aunts
and
grandmother
sure
evidence
of
predestination
paulina
was
to
be
the
interpreter
of
the
oracle
and
the
philosophic
fumes
so
vertiginous
to
meaner
minds
would
throw
her
into
the
needed
condition
of
clairvoyance
nothing
could
have
been
more
genuine
than
the
emotion
on
which
this
theory
was
based
paulina
in
fact
delighted
in
her
grandfather
s
writings
his
sonorous
periods
his
mystic
vocabulary
his
bold
flights
into
the
rarefied
air
of
the
abstract
were
thrilling
to
a
fancy
unhampered
by
the
need
of
definitions
this
purely
verbal
pleasure
was
supplemented
later
by
the
excitement
of
gathering
up
crumbs
of
meaning
from
the
rhetorical
board
what
could
have
been
more
stimulating
than
to
construct
the
theory
of
a
girlish
world
out
of
the
fragments
of
this
titanic
cosmogony
before
paulina
s
opinions
had
reached
the
stage
when
ossification
sets
in
their
form
was
fatally
predetermined
the
fact
that
anson
had
died
and
that
his
apotheosis
had
taken
place
before
his
young
priestess
s
induction
to
the
temple
made
her
ministrations
easier
and
more
inspiring
there
were
no
little
personal
traits
such
as
the
great
man
s
manner
of
helping
himself
to
salt
or
the
guttural
cluck
that
started
the
wheels
of
speech
to
distract
the
eye
of
young
veneration
from
the
central
fact
of
his
divinity
a
man
whom
one
knows
only
through
a
crayon
portrait
and
a
dozen
yellowing
tomes
on
and
intuition
is
at
least
secure
from
the
belittling
effects
of
intimacy
paulina
thus
grew
up
in
a
world
readjusted
to
the
fact
of
her
grandfather
s
greatness
and
as
each
organism
draws
from
its
surroundings
the
kind
of
nourishment
most
needful
to
its
growth
so
from
this
somewhat
colorless
conception
she
absorbed
warmth
brightness
and
variety
paulina
was
the
type
of
woman
who
transmutes
thought
into
sensation
and
nurses
a
theory
in
her
bosom
like
a
child
in
due
course
anson
passed
away
no
one
died
in
the
anson
vocabulary
and
paulina
became
more
than
ever
the
foremost
figure
of
the
commemorative
group
laura
and
phoebe
content
to
leave
their
father
s
glory
in
more
competent
hands
placidly
lapsed
into
needlework
and
fiction
and
their
niece
stepped
into
immediate
prominence
as
the
chief
authority
on
the
great
man
historians
who
were
getting
up
the
period
wrote
to
consult
her
and
to
borrow
documents
ladies
with
inexplicable
yearnings
begged
for
an
interpretation
of
phrases
which
had
influenced
them
but
which
they
had
not
quite
understood
critics
applied
to
her
to
verify
some
doubtful
citation
or
to
decide
some
disputed
point
in
chronology
and
the
great
tide
of
thought
and
investigation
kept
up
a
continuous
murmur
on
the
quiet
shores
of
her
life
an
explorer
of
another
kind
disembarked
there
one
day
in
the
shape
of
a
young
man
to
whom
paulina
was
primarily
a
kissable
girl
with
an
in
the
shape
of
a
grandfather
from
the
outset
it
had
been
impossible
to
fix
hewlett
winsloe
s
attention
on
anson
the
young
man
behaved
with
the
innocent
profanity
of
infants
sporting
on
a
tomb
his
excuse
was
that
he
came
from
new
york
a
cimmerian
outskirt
which
survived
in
paulina
s
geography
only
because
anson
had
gone
there
once
or
twice
to
lecture
the
curious
thing
was
that
she
should
have
thought
it
worth
while
to
find
excuses
for
young
winsloe
the
fact
that
she
did
so
had
not
escaped
the
attention
of
the
village
but
people
after
a
gasp
of
awe
said
it
was
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
that
a
girl
like
paulina
anson
should
think
of
marrying
it
would
certainly
seem
a
little
odd
to
see
a
man
in
the
house
but
young
winsloe
would
of
course
understand
that
the
doctor
s
books
were
not
to
be
disturbed
and
that
he
must
go
down
to
the
orchard
to
smoke
the
village
had
barely
framed
this
when
it
was
convulsed
by
the
announcement
that
young
winsloe
declined
to
live
in
the
house
on
any
terms
hang
going
down
to
the
orchard
to
smoke
he
meant
to
take
his
wife
to
new
york
the
village
drew
its
breath
and
watched
did
persephone
snatched
from
the
warm
fields
of
enna
peer
down
the
abyss
that
opened
at
her
feet
paulina
it
must
be
owned
hung
a
moment
over
the
black
gulf
of
temptation
she
would
have
found
it
easy
to
cope
with
a
deliberate
disregard
of
her
grandfather
s
rights
but
young
winsloe
s
unconsciousness
of
that
shadowy
claim
was
as
much
a
natural
function
as
the
falling
of
leaves
on
a
grave
his
love
was
an
embodiment
of
the
perpetual
renewal
which
to
some
tender
spirits
seems
a
crueller
process
than
decay
on
women
of
paulina
s
mould
this
piety
toward
implicit
demands
toward
the
ghosts
of
dead
duties
walking
unappeased
among
usurping
passions
has
a
stronger
hold
than
any
tangible
bond
people
said
that
she
gave
up
young
winsloe
because
her
aunts
disapproved
of
her
leaving
them
but
such
disapproval
as
reached
her
was
an
emanation
from
the
walls
of
the
house
from
the
bare
desk
the
faded
portraits
the
dozen
yellowing
tomes
that
no
hand
but
hers
ever
lifted
from
the
shelf
ii
after
that
the
house
possessed
her
as
if
conscious
of
its
victory
it
imposed
a
conqueror
s
claims
it
had
once
been
suggested
that
she
should
write
a
life
of
her
grandfather
and
the
task
from
which
she
had
shrunk
as
from
a
privilege
now
shaped
itself
into
a
justification
of
her
course
in
a
burst
of
filial
pantheism
she
tried
to
lose
herself
in
the
vast
ancestral
consciousness
her
one
refuge
from
scepticism
was
a
blind
faith
in
the
magnitude
and
the
endurance
of
the
idea
to
which
she
had
sacrificed
her
life
and
with
a
passionate
instinct
of
she
labored
to
fortify
her
position
the
preparations
for
the
led
her
through
that
the
most
scrupulous
of
the
previous
biographers
had
left
unexplored
she
accumulated
her
material
with
a
blind
animal
patience
unconscious
of
fortuitous
risks
the
years
stretched
before
her
like
some
vast
blank
page
spread
out
to
receive
the
record
of
her
toil
and
she
had
a
mystic
conviction
that
she
would
not
die
till
her
work
was
accomplished
the
aunts
sustained
by
no
such
high
purpose
withdrew
in
turn
to
their
respective
divisions
of
the
anson
plot
and
paulina
remained
alone
with
her
task
she
was
forty
when
the
book
was
completed
she
had
travelled
little
in
her
life
and
it
had
become
more
and
more
difficult
to
her
to
leave
the
house
even
for
a
day
but
the
dread
of
entrusting
her
document
to
a
strange
hand
made
her
decide
to
carry
it
herself
to
the
publisher
on
the
way
to
boston
she
had
a
sudden
vision
of
the
loneliness
to
which
this
last
parting
condemned
her
all
her
youth
all
her
dreams
all
her
renunciations
lay
in
that
neat
bundle
on
her
knee
it
was
not
so
much
her
grandfather
s
life
as
her
own
that
she
had
written
and
the
knowledge
that
it
would
come
back
to
her
in
all
the
glorification
of
print
was
of
no
more
help
than
to
a
mother
s
grief
the
assurance
that
the
lad
she
must
part
with
will
return
with
epaulets
she
had
naturally
addressed
herself
to
the
firm
which
had
published
her
grandfather
s
works
its
founder
a
personal
friend
of
the
philosopher
s
had
survived
the
olympian
group
of
which
he
had
been
a
subordinate
member
long
enough
to
bestow
his
octogenarian
approval
on
paulina
s
pious
undertaking
but
he
had
died
soon
afterward
and
miss
anson
found
herself
confronted
by
his
grandson
a
person
with
a
brisk
commercial
view
of
his
trade
who
was
said
to
have
put
new
blood
into
the
firm
this
gentleman
listened
attentively
fingering
her
manuscript
as
though
literature
were
a
tactile
substance
then
with
a
confidential
twist
of
his
revolving
chair
he
emitted
the
verdict
we
ought
to
have
had
this
ten
years
miss
anson
took
the
words
as
an
allusion
to
the
repressed
avidity
of
her
readers
it
has
been
a
long
time
for
the
public
to
wait
she
solemnly
assented
the
publisher
smiled
they
haven
t
waited
he
said
she
looked
at
him
strangely
haven
t
waited
no
they
ve
gone
off
taken
another
train
literature
s
like
a
big
now
you
know
there
s
a
train
starting
every
minute
people
are
not
going
to
hang
round
the
if
they
can
t
get
to
a
place
when
they
want
to
they
go
somewhere
the
application
of
this
parable
cost
miss
anson
several
minutes
of
throbbing
silence
at
length
she
said
then
i
am
to
understand
that
the
public
is
no
longer
interested
in
in
my
grandfather
she
felt
as
though
heaven
must
blast
the
lips
that
risked
such
a
conjecture
well
it
s
this
way
he
s
a
name
still
of
course
people
don
t
exactly
want
to
be
caught
not
knowing
who
he
is
but
they
don
t
want
to
spend
two
dollars
finding
out
when
they
can
look
him
up
for
nothing
in
any
biographical
miss
anson
s
world
reeled
she
felt
herself
adrift
among
mysterious
forces
and
no
more
thought
of
prolonging
the
discussion
than
of
opposing
an
earthquake
with
argument
she
went
home
carrying
the
manuscript
like
a
wounded
thing
on
the
return
journey
she
found
herself
travelling
straight
toward
a
fact
that
had
lurked
for
months
in
the
background
of
her
life
and
that
now
seemed
to
await
her
on
the
very
threshold
the
fact
that
fewer
visitors
came
to
the
house
she
owned
to
herself
that
for
the
last
four
or
five
years
the
number
had
steadily
diminished
engrossed
in
her
work
she
had
noted
the
change
only
to
feel
thankful
that
she
had
fewer
interruptions
there
had
been
a
time
when
at
the
travelling
season
the
bell
rang
continuously
and
the
ladies
of
the
house
lived
in
a
chronic
state
of
best
silks
and
expectancy
it
would
have
been
impossible
then
to
carry
on
any
consecutive
work
and
she
now
saw
that
the
silence
which
had
gathered
round
her
task
had
been
the
hush
of
death
not
of
death
the
very
walls
cried
out
against
the
implication
it
was
the
world
s
enthusiasm
the
world
s
faith
the
world
s
loyalty
that
had
died
a
corrupt
generation
that
had
turned
aside
to
worship
the
brazen
serpent
her
heart
yearned
with
a
prophetic
passion
over
the
lost
sheep
straying
in
the
wilderness
but
all
great
glories
had
their
interlunar
period
and
in
due
time
her
grandfather
would
once
more
flash
upon
a
darkling
world
the
few
friends
to
whom
she
confided
her
adventure
reminded
her
with
tender
indignation
that
there
were
other
publishers
less
subject
to
the
fluctuations
of
the
market
but
much
as
she
had
braved
for
her
grandfather
she
could
not
again
brave
that
particular
probation
she
found
herself
in
fact
incapable
of
any
immediate
effort
she
had
lost
her
way
in
a
labyrinth
of
conjecture
where
her
worst
dread
was
that
she
might
put
her
hand
upon
the
clue
she
locked
up
the
manuscript
and
sat
down
to
wait
if
a
pilgrim
had
come
just
then
the
priestess
would
have
fallen
on
his
neck
but
she
continued
to
celebrate
her
rites
alone
it
was
a
double
solitude
for
she
had
always
thought
a
great
deal
more
of
the
people
who
came
to
see
the
house
than
of
the
people
who
came
to
see
her
she
fancied
that
the
neighbors
kept
a
keen
eye
on
the
path
to
the
house
and
there
were
days
when
the
figure
of
a
stranger
strolling
past
the
gate
seemed
to
focus
upon
her
the
scorching
sympathies
of
the
village
for
a
time
she
thought
of
travelling
of
going
to
europe
or
even
to
boston
but
to
leave
the
house
now
would
have
seemed
like
deserting
her
post
gradually
her
scattered
energies
centred
themselves
in
the
fierce
resolve
to
understand
what
had
happened
she
was
not
the
woman
to
live
long
in
an
unmapped
country
or
to
accept
as
final
her
private
interpretation
of
phenomena
like
a
traveller
in
unfamiliar
regions
she
began
to
store
for
future
guidance
the
minutest
natural
signs
unflinchingly
she
noted
the
accumulating
symptoms
of
indifference
that
marked
her
grandfather
s
descent
toward
posterity
she
passed
from
the
heights
on
which
he
had
been
grouped
with
the
sages
of
his
day
to
the
lower
level
where
he
had
come
to
be
the
friend
of
emerson
the
correspondent
of
hawthorne
or
later
still
the
anson
mentioned
in
their
letters
the
change
had
taken
place
as
slowly
and
imperceptibly
as
a
natural
process
she
could
not
say
that
any
ruthless
hand
had
stripped
the
leaves
from
the
tree
it
was
simply
that
among
the
evergreen
glories
of
his
group
her
grandfather
s
had
proved
deciduous
she
had
still
to
ask
herself
why
if
the
decay
had
been
a
natural
process
was
it
not
the
very
pledge
of
renewal
it
was
easier
to
find
such
arguments
than
to
be
convinced
by
them
again
and
again
she
tried
to
drug
her
solicitude
with
analogies
but
at
last
she
saw
that
such
expedients
were
but
the
expression
of
a
growing
incredulity
the
best
way
of
proving
her
faith
in
her
grandfather
was
not
to
be
afraid
of
his
critics
she
had
no
notion
where
these
shadowy
antagonists
lurked
for
she
had
never
heard
of
the
great
man
s
doctrine
being
directly
combated
oblique
assaults
there
must
have
been
however
parthian
shots
at
the
giant
that
none
dared
face
and
she
thirsted
to
close
with
such
assailants
the
difficulty
was
to
find
them
she
began
by
the
thence
she
passed
to
the
writers
of
the
same
school
those
whose
rhetoric
bloomed
perennial
in
from
which
her
grandfather
s
prose
had
long
since
faded
amid
that
clamor
of
enthusiasms
she
detected
no
controversial
note
the
little
knot
of
olympians
held
their
views
in
common
with
an
promiscuity
they
were
continually
proclaiming
their
admiration
for
each
other
the
public
joining
as
chorus
in
this
guileless
antiphon
of
praise
and
she
discovered
no
traitor
in
their
midst
what
then
had
happened
was
it
simply
that
the
main
current
of
thought
had
set
another
way
then
why
did
the
others
survive
why
were
they
still
marked
down
as
tributaries
to
the
philosophic
stream
this
question
carried
her
still
farther
afield
and
she
pressed
on
with
the
passion
of
a
champion
whose
reluctance
to
know
the
worst
might
be
construed
into
a
doubt
of
his
cause
at
length
slowly
but
inevitably
an
explanation
shaped
itself
death
had
overtaken
the
doctrines
about
which
her
grandfather
had
draped
his
cloudy
rhetoric
they
had
disintegrated
and
been
adding
their
little
pile
to
the
dust
drifted
about
the
mute
lips
of
the
sphinx
the
great
man
s
contemporaries
had
survived
not
by
reason
of
what
they
taught
but
of
what
they
were
and
he
who
had
been
the
mere
mask
through
which
they
mouthed
their
lesson
the
instrument
on
which
their
tune
was
played
lay
buried
deep
among
the
obsolete
tools
of
thought
the
discovery
came
to
paulina
suddenly
she
looked
up
one
evening
from
her
reading
and
it
stood
before
her
like
a
ghost
it
had
entered
her
life
with
stealthy
steps
creeping
close
before
she
was
aware
of
it
she
sat
in
the
library
among
the
books
and
portraits
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
been
walled
alive
into
a
tomb
hung
with
the
effigies
of
dead
ideas
she
felt
a
desperate
longing
to
escape
into
the
outer
air
where
people
toiled
and
loved
and
living
sympathies
went
hand
in
hand
it
was
the
sense
of
wasted
labor
that
oppressed
her
of
two
lives
consumed
in
that
ruthless
process
that
uses
generations
of
effort
to
build
a
single
cell
there
was
a
dreary
parallel
between
her
grandfather
s
fruitless
toil
and
her
own
unprofitable
sacrifice
each
in
turn
had
kept
vigil
by
a
corpse
iii
the
bell
rang
she
remembered
it
afterward
with
a
loud
thrilling
note
it
was
what
they
used
to
call
the
visitor
s
ring
not
the
tentative
tinkle
of
a
neighbor
dropping
in
to
borrow
a
or
discuss
parochial
incidents
but
a
decisive
summons
from
the
outer
world
miss
anson
put
down
her
knitting
and
listened
she
sat
now
making
her
rheumatism
an
excuse
for
avoiding
the
rooms
below
her
interests
had
insensibly
adjusted
themselves
to
the
perspective
of
her
neighbors
lives
and
she
wondered
as
the
bell
if
it
could
mean
that
heminway
s
baby
had
come
conjecture
had
time
to
ripen
into
certainty
and
she
was
limping
toward
the
closet
where
her
cloak
and
bonnet
hung
when
her
little
maid
fluttered
in
with
the
announcement
a
gentleman
to
see
the
the
yes
m
m
i
don
t
know
what
he
means
faltered
the
messenger
whose
memory
did
not
embrace
the
period
when
such
announcements
were
a
daily
part
of
the
domestic
routine
miss
anson
glanced
at
the
proffered
card
the
name
it
bore
george
was
unknown
to
her
but
the
blood
rose
to
her
languid
cheek
hand
me
my
mechlin
cap
katy
she
said
trembling
a
little
as
she
laid
aside
her
walking
stick
she
put
her
cap
on
before
the
mirror
with
rapid
unsteady
touches
did
you
draw
up
the
library
blinds
she
breathlessly
asked
she
had
gradually
built
up
a
wall
of
commonplace
between
herself
and
her
illusions
but
at
the
first
summons
of
the
past
filial
passion
swept
away
the
frail
barriers
of
expediency
she
walked
so
hurriedly
that
her
stick
clicked
like
a
girlish
heel
but
in
the
hall
she
paused
wondering
nervously
if
katy
had
put
a
match
to
the
fire
the
autumn
air
was
cold
and
she
had
the
reproachful
vision
of
a
visitor
with
elderly
ailments
shivering
by
her
inhospitable
hearth
she
thought
instinctively
of
the
stranger
as
a
survivor
of
the
days
when
such
a
visit
was
a
part
of
the
young
enthusiast
s
itinerary
the
fire
was
unlit
and
the
room
forbiddingly
cold
but
the
figure
which
as
miss
anson
entered
turned
from
a
lingering
scrutiny
of
the
was
that
of
a
sanguine
youth
clearly
independent
of
any
artificial
caloric
she
stood
still
a
moment
feeling
herself
the
victim
of
some
anterior
impression
that
made
this
robust
presence
an
insubstantial
thing
but
the
young
man
advanced
with
an
air
of
genial
assurance
which
rendered
him
at
once
more
real
and
more
reminiscent
why
this
you
know
he
exclaimed
is
simply
immense
the
words
which
did
not
immediately
present
themselves
as
slang
to
miss
anson
s
unaccustomed
ear
echoed
with
an
odd
familiarity
through
the
academic
silence
the
room
you
know
i
mean
he
explained
with
a
comprehensive
gesture
these
jolly
portraits
and
the
books
that
s
the
old
gentleman
himself
over
the
mantelpiece
i
suppose
and
the
elms
outside
and
and
the
whole
business
i
do
like
a
congruous
background
don
t
you
his
hostess
was
silent
no
one
but
hewlett
winsloe
had
ever
spoken
of
her
grandfather
as
the
old
it
s
a
hundred
times
better
than
i
could
have
hoped
her
visitor
continued
with
a
cheerful
disregard
of
her
silence
the
seclusion
the
remoteness
the
philosophic
atmosphere
there
s
so
little
of
that
kind
of
flavor
left
i
should
have
simply
hated
to
find
that
he
lived
over
a
grocery
you
i
had
the
deuce
of
a
time
finding
out
where
he
live
he
began
again
after
another
glance
of
parenthetical
enjoyment
but
finally
i
got
on
the
trail
through
some
old
book
on
brook
farm
i
was
bound
i
d
get
the
environment
right
before
i
did
my
miss
anson
by
this
time
had
recovered
sufficient
to
seat
herself
and
assign
a
chair
to
her
visitor
do
i
understand
she
asked
slowly
following
his
rapid
eye
about
the
room
that
you
intend
to
write
an
article
about
my
grandfather
that
s
what
i
m
here
for
corby
genially
responded
that
is
if
you
re
willing
to
help
me
for
i
can
t
get
on
without
your
help
he
added
with
a
confident
smile
there
was
another
pause
during
which
miss
anson
noticed
a
fleck
of
dust
on
the
faded
leather
of
the
and
a
fresh
spot
of
discoloration
in
the
upper
corner
of
raphael
morghen
s
then
you
believe
in
him
she
said
looking
up
she
could
not
tell
what
had
prompted
her
the
words
rushed
out
irresistibly
believe
in
him
corby
cried
springing
to
his
feet
believe
in
orestes
anson
why
i
believe
he
s
simply
the
greatest
the
most
stupendous
the
most
phenomenal
figure
we
ve
got
the
color
rose
to
miss
anson
s
brow
her
heart
was
beating
passionately
she
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
young
man
s
face
as
though
it
might
vanish
if
she
looked
away
you
you
mean
to
say
this
in
your
article
she
asked
say
it
why
the
facts
will
say
it
he
exulted
the
baldest
kind
of
a
statement
would
make
it
clear
when
a
man
is
as
big
as
that
he
doesn
t
need
a
pedestal
miss
anson
sighed
people
used
to
say
that
when
i
was
young
she
murmured
but
now
her
visitor
stared
when
you
were
young
but
how
did
they
know
when
the
thing
hung
fire
as
it
did
when
the
whole
edition
was
thrown
back
on
his
hands
the
whole
edition
what
edition
it
was
miss
anson
s
turn
to
stare
why
of
his
pamphlet
pamphlet
the
one
thing
that
counts
that
survives
that
makes
him
what
he
is
for
heaven
s
sake
he
tragically
adjured
her
don
t
tell
me
there
isn
t
a
copy
of
it
left
miss
anson
was
trembling
slightly
i
don
t
think
i
understand
what
you
mean
she
faltered
less
bewildered
by
his
vehemence
than
by
the
strange
sense
of
coming
on
an
unexplored
region
in
the
very
heart
of
her
dominion
why
his
account
of
the
of
course
you
can
t
mean
that
his
family
didn
t
know
about
it
that
don
t
know
about
it
i
came
across
it
by
the
merest
accident
myself
in
a
letter
of
vindication
that
he
wrote
in
to
an
old
scientific
paper
but
i
understood
there
were
journals
early
journals
there
must
be
references
to
it
somewhere
in
the
twenties
he
must
have
been
at
least
ten
or
twelve
years
ahead
of
yarrell
and
he
saw
the
whole
significance
of
it
too
he
saw
where
it
led
to
as
i
understand
it
he
actually
anticipated
in
his
pamphlet
saint
hilaire
s
theory
of
the
universal
type
and
supported
the
hypothesis
by
describing
the
notochord
of
the
as
a
cartilaginous
vertebral
column
the
specialists
of
the
day
jeered
at
him
of
course
as
the
specialists
in
goethe
s
time
jeered
at
the
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
the
anatomists
and
zoologists
were
down
on
anson
to
a
man
that
was
why
his
cowardly
publishers
went
back
on
their
bargain
but
the
pamphlet
must
be
here
somewhere
he
writes
as
though
in
his
first
disappointment
he
had
destroyed
the
whole
edition
but
surely
there
must
be
at
least
one
copy
left
his
scientific
jargon
was
as
bewildering
as
his
slang
and
there
were
even
moments
in
his
discourse
when
miss
anson
ceased
to
distinguish
between
them
but
the
suspense
with
which
he
continued
to
gaze
on
her
acted
as
a
challenge
to
her
scattered
thoughts
the
she
murmured
it
s
an
animal
isn
t
it
a
fish
yes
i
think
i
she
sank
back
with
the
inward
look
of
one
who
retraces
some
lost
line
of
association
gradually
the
distance
cleared
the
details
started
into
life
in
her
researches
for
the
biography
she
had
patiently
followed
every
ramification
of
her
subject
and
one
of
these
overgrown
paths
now
led
her
back
to
the
episode
in
question
the
great
orestes
s
title
of
doctor
had
in
fact
not
been
merely
the
spontaneous
tribute
of
a
national
admiration
he
had
actually
studied
medicine
in
his
youth
and
his
diaries
as
his
granddaughter
now
recalled
showed
that
he
had
passed
through
a
brief
phase
of
anatomical
ardor
before
his
attention
was
diverted
to
problems
it
had
indeed
seemed
to
paulina
as
she
scanned
those
early
pages
that
they
revealed
a
spontaneity
a
freshness
of
feeling
somehow
absent
from
his
later
lucubrations
as
though
this
one
emotion
had
reached
him
directly
the
others
through
some
intervening
medium
in
the
excess
of
her
commemorative
zeal
she
had
even
struggled
through
the
unintelligible
pamphlet
to
which
a
few
lines
in
the
journal
had
bitterly
directed
her
but
the
subject
and
the
phraseology
were
alien
to
her
and
unconnected
with
her
conception
of
the
great
man
s
genius
and
after
a
hurried
perusal
she
had
averted
her
thoughts
from
the
episode
as
from
a
revelation
of
failure
at
length
she
rose
a
little
unsteadily
supporting
herself
against
the
she
looked
hesitatingly
about
the
room
then
she
drew
a
key
from
her
reticule
and
unlocked
a
drawer
beneath
one
of
the
young
corby
watched
her
breathlessly
with
a
tremulous
hand
she
turned
over
the
dusty
documents
that
seemed
to
fill
the
drawer
is
this
it
she
said
holding
out
a
thin
discolored
volume
he
seized
it
with
a
gasp
oh
by
george
he
said
dropping
into
the
nearest
chair
she
stood
observing
him
strangely
as
his
eye
devoured
the
mouldy
pages
is
this
the
only
copy
left
he
asked
at
length
looking
up
for
a
moment
as
a
thirsty
man
lifts
his
head
from
his
glass
i
think
it
must
be
i
found
it
long
ago
among
some
old
papers
that
my
aunts
were
burning
up
after
my
grandmother
s
death
they
said
it
was
of
no
use
that
he
d
always
meant
to
destroy
the
whole
edition
and
that
i
ought
to
respect
his
wishes
but
it
was
something
he
had
written
to
burn
it
was
like
shutting
the
door
against
his
voice
against
something
he
had
once
wished
to
say
and
that
nobody
had
listened
to
i
wanted
him
to
feel
that
i
was
always
here
ready
to
listen
even
when
others
hadn
t
thought
it
worth
while
and
so
i
kept
the
pamphlet
meaning
to
carry
out
his
wish
and
destroy
it
before
my
her
visitor
gave
a
groan
of
retrospective
anguish
and
but
for
me
but
for
you
would
have
i
should
have
thought
it
my
oh
by
george
by
george
he
repeated
subdued
afresh
by
the
inadequacy
of
speech
she
continued
to
watch
him
in
silence
at
length
he
jumped
up
and
impulsively
caught
her
by
both
hands
he
s
bigger
and
bigger
he
almost
shouted
he
simply
leads
the
field
you
ll
help
me
go
to
the
bottom
of
this
won
t
you
we
must
turn
out
all
the
papers
letters
journals
memoranda
he
must
have
made
notes
he
must
have
left
some
record
of
what
led
up
to
this
we
must
leave
nothing
unexplored
by
jove
he
cried
looking
up
at
her
with
his
bright
convincing
smile
do
you
know
you
re
the
granddaughter
of
a
great
man
her
color
flickered
like
a
girl
s
are
you
sure
of
him
she
whispered
as
though
putting
him
on
his
guard
against
a
possible
betrayal
of
trust
sure
sure
my
dear
lady
he
measured
her
again
with
his
quick
confident
glance
don
t
believe
in
him
she
drew
back
with
a
confused
murmur
i
used
she
had
left
her
hands
in
his
their
pressure
seemed
to
send
a
warm
current
to
her
heart
it
ruined
my
life
she
cried
with
sudden
passion
he
looked
at
her
perplexedly
i
gave
up
everything
she
went
on
wildly
to
keep
him
alive
i
sacrificed
myself
others
i
nursed
his
glory
in
my
bosom
and
it
died
and
left
me
left
me
here
she
paused
and
gathered
her
courage
with
a
gasp
don
t
make
the
same
mistake
she
warned
him
he
shook
his
head
still
smiling
no
danger
of
that
you
re
not
alone
my
dear
lady
he
s
here
with
you
he
s
come
back
to
you
don
t
you
see
what
s
happened
don
t
you
see
that
it
s
your
love
that
has
kept
him
alive
if
you
d
abandoned
your
post
for
an
instant
let
things
pass
into
other
hands
if
your
wonderful
tenderness
hadn
t
perpetually
kept
guard
this
might
have
been
must
have
been
irretrievably
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
pamphlet
and
then
then
he
have
been
dead
oh
she
said
don
t
tell
me
too
suddenly
and
she
turned
away
and
sank
into
a
chair
the
young
man
stood
watching
her
in
an
awed
silence
for
a
long
time
she
sat
motionless
with
her
face
hidden
and
he
thought
she
must
be
weeping
at
length
he
said
almost
shyly
you
ll
let
me
come
back
then
you
ll
help
me
work
this
thing
out
she
rose
calmly
and
held
out
her
hand
i
ll
help
you
she
declared
i
ll
come
then
can
we
get
to
work
early
as
early
as
you
at
eight
o
clock
then
he
said
briskly
you
ll
have
the
papers
ready
i
ll
have
everything
she
added
with
a
hesitancy
and
the
fire
shall
be
lit
for
he
went
out
with
his
bright
nod
she
walked
to
the
window
and
watched
his
buoyant
figure
hastening
down
the
street
when
she
turned
back
into
the
empty
room
she
looked
as
though
youth
had
touched
her
on
the
lips
the
recovery
to
the
visiting
stranger
hillbridge
s
first
question
was
have
you
seen
keniston
s
things
keniston
took
precedence
of
the
colonial
state
house
the
gilbert
stuart
washington
and
the
ethnological
museum
nay
he
ran
neck
and
neck
with
the
president
of
the
university
a
prehistoric
relic
who
had
known
emerson
and
who
was
still
sent
about
the
country
in
to
open
educational
institutions
with
a
toothless
oration
on
brook
farm
keniston
was
sent
about
the
country
too
he
opened
art
exhibitions
laid
the
foundation
of
academies
and
acted
in
a
general
sense
as
the
spokesman
and
apologist
of
art
hillbridge
was
proud
of
him
in
his
peripatetic
character
but
his
let
it
be
understood
that
to
know
keniston
one
must
come
to
hillbridge
never
was
work
more
dependent
for
its
effect
on
atmosphere
on
hillbridge
was
keniston
s
milieu
and
there
was
one
lady
a
devotee
of
his
art
who
went
so
far
as
to
assert
that
once
at
an
exhibition
in
new
york
she
had
passed
a
keniston
without
recognizing
it
it
simply
didn
t
want
to
be
seen
in
such
surroundings
it
was
hiding
itself
under
an
incognito
she
declared
it
was
a
source
of
special
pride
to
hillbridge
that
it
contained
all
the
artist
s
best
works
strangers
were
told
that
hillbridge
had
discovered
him
the
discovery
had
come
about
in
the
simplest
manner
professor
driffert
who
had
a
reputation
for
collecting
had
one
day
hung
a
sketch
on
his
wall
and
thereafter
driffert
s
visitors
always
a
little
flurried
by
the
sense
that
it
was
the
kind
of
house
in
which
one
might
be
suddenly
called
upon
to
distinguish
between
a
and
an
etching
or
between
raphael
mengs
and
raphael
sanzio
were
not
infrequently
subjected
to
the
professor
s
inquiry
have
you
seen
my
keniston
the
visitors
perceptibly
awed
would
retreat
to
a
critical
distance
and
murmur
the
usual
guarded
generalities
while
they
tried
to
keep
the
name
in
mind
long
enough
to
look
it
up
in
the
encyclopædia
the
name
was
not
in
the
encyclopædia
but
as
a
compensating
fact
it
became
known
that
the
man
himself
was
in
hillbridge
hillbridge
then
owned
an
artist
whose
celebrity
it
was
the
proper
thing
to
take
for
granted
some
one
else
emboldened
by
the
thought
bought
a
keniston
and
the
next
year
on
the
occasion
of
the
president
s
golden
jubilee
the
faculty
by
unanimous
consent
presented
him
with
a
keniston
two
years
later
there
was
a
keniston
exhibition
to
which
the
came
from
new
york
and
boston
and
not
long
afterward
a
chicago
collector
vainly
attempted
to
buy
professor
driffert
s
sketch
which
the
art
journals
cited
as
a
rare
example
of
the
painter
s
first
or
silvery
manner
thus
there
gradually
grew
up
a
small
circle
of
connoisseurs
known
in
artistic
circles
as
men
who
collected
kenistons
professor
wildmarsh
of
the
chair
of
fine
arts
and
archaeology
was
the
first
critic
to
publish
a
detailed
analysis
of
the
master
s
methods
and
purpose
the
article
was
illustrated
by
engravings
which
though
they
had
cost
the
magazine
a
fortune
were
declared
by
professor
wildmarsh
to
give
but
an
imperfect
suggestion
of
the
esoteric
significance
of
the
originals
the
professor
with
a
tact
that
contrived
to
make
each
reader
feel
himself
included
among
the
exceptions
went
on
to
say
that
keniston
s
work
would
never
appeal
to
any
but
exceptional
natures
and
he
closed
with
the
usual
assertion
that
to
apprehend
the
full
meaning
of
the
master
s
message
it
was
necessary
to
see
him
in
the
surroundings
of
his
own
home
at
hillbridge
professor
wildmarsh
s
article
was
read
one
spring
afternoon
by
a
young
lady
just
speeding
eastward
on
her
first
visit
to
hillbridge
and
already
flushed
with
anticipation
of
the
intellectual
opportunities
awaiting
her
in
east
onondaigua
where
she
lived
hillbridge
was
looked
on
as
an
oxford
magazine
writers
with
the
easy
american
use
of
the
superlative
designated
it
as
the
venerable
alma
mater
the
antique
seat
of
learning
and
claudia
day
had
been
brought
up
to
regard
it
as
the
of
knowledge
and
of
that
mental
distinction
which
is
so
much
rarer
than
knowledge
an
innate
passion
for
all
that
was
thus
distinguished
and
exceptional
made
her
revere
hillbridge
as
the
native
soil
of
those
intellectual
amenities
that
were
of
such
difficult
growth
in
the
thin
air
of
east
onondaigua
at
the
first
suggestion
of
a
visit
to
hillbridge
whither
she
went
at
the
invitation
of
a
girl
friend
who
incredible
apotheosis
had
married
one
of
the
university
professors
claudia
s
spirit
dilated
with
the
sense
of
new
possibilities
the
vision
of
herself
walking
under
the
historic
elms
toward
the
memorial
library
standing
rapt
before
the
stuart
washington
or
drinking
in
from
some
obscure
corner
of
an
academic
the
president
s
reminiscences
of
the
concord
group
this
vividness
of
into
the
emotions
awaiting
her
made
her
glad
of
any
delay
that
prolonged
so
exquisite
a
moment
it
was
in
this
mood
that
she
opened
the
article
on
keniston
she
knew
about
him
of
course
she
was
wonderfully
well
up
even
for
east
onondaigua
she
had
read
of
him
in
the
magazines
she
had
met
on
a
visit
to
new
york
a
man
who
collected
kenistons
and
a
photogravure
of
a
keniston
in
an
artistic
frame
hung
above
her
at
home
but
professor
wildmarsh
s
article
made
her
feel
how
little
she
really
knew
of
the
master
and
she
trembled
to
think
of
the
state
of
relative
ignorance
in
which
but
for
the
timely
purchase
of
the
magazine
she
might
have
entered
hillbridge
she
had
for
instance
been
densely
unaware
that
keniston
had
already
had
three
manners
and
was
showing
symptoms
of
a
fourth
she
was
equally
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
he
had
founded
a
school
and
created
a
formula
and
she
learned
with
a
thrill
that
no
one
could
hope
to
understand
him
who
had
not
seen
him
in
his
studio
at
hillbridge
surrounded
by
his
own
works
the
man
and
the
art
interpret
each
other
their
exponent
declared
and
claudia
day
bending
a
brilliant
eye
on
the
future
wondered
if
she
were
ever
to
be
admitted
to
the
privilege
of
that
double
initiation
keniston
to
his
other
claims
to
distinction
added
that
of
being
hard
to
know
his
friends
always
hastened
to
announce
the
fact
to
strangers
adding
after
a
pause
of
suspense
that
they
would
see
what
they
could
visitors
in
whose
favor
he
was
induced
to
make
an
exception
were
further
warned
that
he
never
spoke
unless
he
was
interested
so
that
they
mustn
t
mind
if
he
remained
silent
it
was
under
these
reassuring
conditions
that
some
ten
days
after
her
arrival
at
hillbridge
miss
day
was
introduced
to
the
master
s
studio
she
found
him
a
tall
man
who
appeared
to
her
youth
and
who
stood
before
his
own
pictures
with
a
vaguely
interrogative
gaze
leaving
the
task
of
their
interpretation
to
the
lady
who
had
courageously
contrived
the
visit
the
studio
to
claudia
s
surprise
was
bare
and
shabby
it
formed
a
rambling
addition
to
the
small
cheerless
house
in
which
the
artist
lived
with
his
mother
and
a
widowed
sister
for
claudia
it
added
the
last
touch
to
his
distinction
to
learn
that
he
was
poor
and
that
what
he
earned
was
devoted
to
the
maintenance
of
the
two
limp
women
who
formed
a
background
to
his
impressive
outline
his
pictures
of
course
fetched
high
prices
but
he
worked
slowly
painfully
as
his
devotees
preferred
to
phrase
it
with
frequent
intervals
of
ill
health
and
inactivity
and
the
circle
of
keniston
connoisseurs
was
still
as
small
as
it
was
distinguished
the
girl
s
fancy
instantly
hailed
in
him
that
favorite
figure
of
imaginative
youth
the
artist
who
would
rather
starve
than
paint
a
it
is
known
to
comparatively
few
that
the
production
of
successful
is
an
art
in
itself
and
that
such
heroic
abstentions
as
keniston
s
are
not
always
purely
voluntary
on
the
occasion
of
her
first
visit
the
artist
said
so
little
that
claudia
was
able
to
indulge
to
the
full
the
harrowing
sense
of
her
inadequacy
no
wonder
she
had
not
been
one
of
the
few
that
he
cared
to
talk
to
every
word
she
uttered
must
so
obviously
have
diminished
the
inducement
she
had
been
cheap
trivial
conventional
at
once
gushing
and
inexpressive
eager
and
constrained
she
could
feel
him
counting
the
minutes
till
the
visit
was
over
and
as
the
door
finally
closed
on
the
scene
of
her
discomfiture
she
almost
shared
the
hope
with
which
she
confidently
credited
him
that
they
might
never
meet
again
ii
davant
glanced
reverentially
about
the
studio
i
have
always
said
she
murmured
that
they
ought
to
be
seen
in
davant
was
young
credulous
and
emotionally
extravagant
she
reminded
claudia
of
her
earlier
self
the
self
that
ten
years
before
had
first
set
an
awestruck
foot
on
that
very
threshold
not
for
sake
davant
continued
but
for
europe
claudia
smiled
she
was
glad
that
her
husband
s
pictures
were
to
be
exhibited
in
paris
she
concurred
in
davant
s
view
of
the
importance
of
the
event
but
she
thought
her
visitor
s
way
of
putting
the
case
a
little
overcharged
ten
years
spent
in
an
atmosphere
of
had
insensibly
developed
in
claudia
a
preference
for
moderation
of
speech
she
believed
in
her
husband
of
course
to
believe
in
him
with
an
increasing
abandonment
and
tenacity
had
become
one
of
the
necessary
laws
of
being
but
she
did
not
believe
in
his
admirers
their
faith
in
him
was
perhaps
as
genuine
as
her
own
but
it
seemed
to
her
less
able
to
give
an
account
of
itself
some
few
of
his
appreciators
doubtless
measured
him
by
their
own
standards
but
it
was
difficult
not
to
feel
that
in
the
hillbridge
circle
where
rapture
ran
the
highest
he
was
accepted
on
what
was
at
best
but
an
indirect
valuation
and
now
and
then
she
had
a
frightened
doubt
as
to
the
independence
of
her
own
convictions
that
innate
sense
of
relativity
which
even
east
onondaigua
had
not
been
able
to
check
in
claudia
day
had
been
fostered
in
keniston
by
the
artistic
absolutism
of
hillbridge
and
she
often
wondered
that
her
husband
remained
so
uncritical
of
the
quality
of
admiration
accorded
him
her
husband
s
uncritical
attitude
toward
himself
and
his
admirers
had
in
fact
been
one
of
the
surprises
of
her
marriage
that
an
artist
should
believe
in
his
potential
powers
seemed
to
her
at
once
the
incentive
and
the
pledge
of
excellence
she
knew
there
was
no
future
for
a
hesitating
talent
what
perplexed
her
was
keniston
s
satisfaction
in
his
achievement
she
had
always
imagined
that
the
true
artist
must
regard
himself
as
the
imperfect
vehicle
of
the
cosmic
emotion
that
beneath
every
difficulty
overcome
a
new
one
lurked
the
vision
widening
as
the
scope
enlarged
to
be
initiated
into
these
creative
struggles
to
shed
on
the
toiler
s
path
the
consolatory
ray
of
faith
and
encouragement
had
seemed
the
chief
privilege
of
her
marriage
but
there
is
something
supererogatory
in
believing
in
a
man
obviously
disposed
to
perform
that
service
for
himself
and
claudia
s
ardor
gradually
spent
itself
against
the
dense
surface
of
her
husband
s
complacency
she
could
smile
now
at
her
vision
of
an
intellectual
communion
which
should
admit
her
to
the
inmost
precincts
of
his
inspiration
she
had
learned
that
the
creative
processes
are
seldom
and
keniston
s
inarticulateness
no
longer
discouraged
her
but
she
could
not
reconcile
her
sense
of
the
continuity
of
all
high
effort
to
his
unperturbed
air
of
finishing
each
picture
as
though
he
had
despatched
a
masterpiece
to
posterity
in
the
first
recoil
from
her
disillusionment
she
even
allowed
herself
to
perceive
that
if
he
worked
slowly
it
was
not
because
he
mistrusted
his
powers
of
expression
but
because
he
had
really
so
little
to
express
it
s
for
europe
davant
vaguely
repeated
and
claudia
noticed
that
she
was
blushingly
intent
on
tracing
with
the
tip
of
her
elaborate
sunshade
the
pattern
of
the
shabby
carpet
it
will
be
a
revelation
to
them
she
went
on
provisionally
as
though
claudia
had
missed
her
cue
and
left
an
awkward
interval
to
fill
claudia
had
in
fact
a
sudden
sense
of
deficient
intuition
she
felt
that
her
visitor
had
something
to
communicate
which
required
on
her
own
part
an
intelligent
but
what
it
was
her
insight
failed
to
suggest
she
was
in
truth
a
little
tired
of
davant
who
was
keniston
s
latest
worshipper
who
ordered
pictures
recklessly
who
paid
for
them
regally
in
advance
and
whose
gallery
was
figuratively
speaking
crowded
with
the
artist
s
unpainted
masterpieces
claudia
s
impatience
was
perhaps
complicated
by
the
uneasy
sense
that
davant
was
too
young
too
rich
too
inexperienced
that
somehow
she
ought
to
be
warned
of
what
that
some
of
the
pictures
might
never
be
painted
scarcely
that
since
keniston
who
was
scrupulous
in
business
transactions
might
be
trusted
not
to
take
any
material
advantage
of
such
evidence
of
faith
claudia
s
impulse
remained
undefined
she
merely
felt
that
she
would
have
liked
to
help
davant
and
that
she
did
not
know
how
you
ll
be
there
to
see
them
she
asked
as
her
visitor
lingered
in
paris
davant
s
blush
deepened
we
must
all
be
there
claudia
smiled
my
husband
and
i
mean
to
go
abroad
some
day
but
i
don
t
see
any
chance
of
it
at
but
he
to
go
you
ought
both
to
go
this
summer
davant
persisted
i
know
professor
wildmarsh
and
professor
driffert
and
all
the
other
critics
think
that
keniston
s
never
having
been
to
europe
has
given
his
work
much
of
its
wonderful
individuality
its
peculiar
flavor
and
meaning
but
now
that
his
talent
is
formed
that
he
has
full
command
of
his
means
of
expression
claudia
recognized
one
of
professor
driffert
s
favorite
formulas
they
all
think
he
ought
to
see
the
work
of
the
great
masters
that
he
ought
to
visit
the
home
of
his
ancestors
as
professor
wildmarsh
says
she
stretched
an
impulsive
hand
to
claudia
you
ought
to
let
him
go
keniston
claudia
accepted
the
admonition
with
the
philosophy
of
the
wife
who
is
used
to
being
advised
on
the
management
of
her
husband
i
sha
n
t
interfere
with
him
she
declared
and
davant
instantly
caught
her
up
with
a
cry
of
oh
it
s
too
lovely
of
you
to
say
that
with
this
exclamation
she
left
claudia
to
a
silent
renewal
of
wonder
a
moment
later
keniston
entered
to
a
mind
curious
in
combinations
it
might
have
occurred
that
he
had
met
davant
on
the
in
one
sense
he
might
for
all
his
wife
cared
have
met
fifty
davants
on
the
it
was
long
since
claudia
had
enjoyed
the
solace
of
resenting
such
coincidences
her
only
thought
now
was
that
her
husband
s
first
words
might
not
improbably
explain
davant
s
last
and
she
waited
for
him
to
speak
he
paused
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
before
an
unfinished
picture
on
the
easel
then
as
his
habit
was
he
began
to
stroll
touristlike
from
canvas
to
canvas
standing
before
each
in
a
musing
ecstasy
of
contemplation
that
no
readjustment
of
view
ever
seemed
to
disturb
her
eye
instinctively
joined
his
in
its
inspection
it
was
the
one
point
where
their
natures
merged
thank
god
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
pictures
she
was
what
she
had
always
dreamed
of
being
the
wife
of
a
great
artist
keniston
dropped
into
an
armchair
and
filled
his
pipe
how
should
you
like
to
go
to
europe
he
asked
his
wife
looked
up
quickly
when
now
this
spring
i
he
paused
to
light
the
pipe
i
should
like
to
be
over
there
while
these
things
are
being
claudia
was
silent
well
he
repeated
after
a
moment
how
can
we
afford
it
she
asked
keniston
had
always
scrupulously
fulfilled
his
duty
to
the
mother
and
sister
whom
his
marriage
had
dislodged
and
claudia
who
had
the
atoning
temperament
which
seeks
to
pay
for
every
happiness
by
making
it
a
source
of
fresh
obligations
had
from
the
outset
accepted
his
ties
with
an
exaggerated
devotion
any
disregard
of
such
a
claim
would
have
vulgarized
her
most
delicate
pleasures
and
her
husband
s
sensitiveness
to
it
in
great
measure
extenuated
the
artistic
obtuseness
that
often
seemed
to
her
like
a
failure
of
the
moral
sense
his
loyalty
to
the
dull
women
who
depended
on
him
was
after
all
compounded
of
finer
tissues
than
any
mere
sensibility
to
ideal
demands
oh
i
don
t
see
why
we
shouldn
t
he
rejoined
i
think
we
might
manage
at
davant
s
expense
leaped
from
claudia
she
could
not
tell
why
she
had
said
it
some
inner
barrier
seemed
to
have
given
way
under
a
confused
pressure
of
emotions
he
looked
up
at
her
with
frank
surprise
well
she
has
been
very
jolly
about
it
why
not
she
has
a
tremendous
feeling
for
art
the
keenest
i
ever
knew
in
a
claudia
imperceptibly
smiled
she
wants
me
to
let
her
pay
in
advance
for
the
four
panels
she
has
ordered
for
the
memorial
library
that
would
give
us
plenty
of
money
for
the
trip
and
my
having
the
panels
to
do
is
another
reason
for
my
wanting
to
go
abroad
just
another
reason
yes
i
ve
never
worked
on
such
a
big
scale
i
want
to
see
how
those
old
chaps
did
the
trick
i
want
to
measure
myself
with
the
big
fellows
over
there
an
artist
ought
to
once
in
his
she
gave
him
a
wondering
look
for
the
first
time
his
words
implied
a
sense
of
possible
limitation
but
his
easy
tone
seemed
to
retract
what
they
conceded
what
he
really
wanted
was
fresh
food
for
his
he
was
like
an
army
that
moves
on
after
exhausting
the
resources
of
the
country
womanlike
she
abandoned
the
general
survey
of
the
case
for
the
consideration
of
a
minor
point
are
you
sure
you
can
do
that
kind
of
thing
she
asked
what
kind
of
thing
the
he
glanced
at
her
indulgently
his
was
too
impenetrable
to
feel
the
of
such
a
doubt
immensely
sure
he
said
with
a
smile
and
you
don
t
mind
taking
so
much
money
from
her
in
advance
he
stared
why
should
i
she
ll
get
it
back
with
interest
he
laughed
and
drew
at
his
pipe
it
will
be
an
uncommonly
interesting
experience
i
shouldn
t
wonder
if
it
freshened
me
up
a
she
looked
at
him
again
this
second
hint
of
struck
her
as
the
sign
of
a
quickened
sensibility
what
if
after
all
he
was
beginning
to
be
dissatisfied
with
his
work
the
thought
filled
her
with
a
renovating
sense
of
his
sufficiency
iii
they
stopped
in
london
to
see
the
national
gallery
it
was
thus
that
in
their
inexperience
they
had
narrowly
put
it
but
in
reality
every
stone
of
the
streets
every
trick
of
the
atmosphere
had
its
message
of
surprise
for
their
virgin
sensibilities
the
pictures
were
simply
the
summing
up
the
final
interpretation
of
the
cumulative
pressure
of
an
unimagined
world
and
it
seemed
to
claudia
that
long
before
they
reached
the
doors
of
the
gallery
she
had
some
intuitive
revelation
of
what
awaited
them
within
they
moved
about
from
room
to
room
without
exchanging
a
word
the
vast
noiseless
spaces
seemed
full
of
sound
like
the
roar
of
a
distant
multitude
heard
only
by
the
inner
ear
had
their
speech
been
articulate
their
language
would
have
been
incomprehensible
and
even
that
murmur
of
meaning
pressed
intolerably
on
claudia
s
nerves
keniston
took
the
onset
without
outward
sign
of
disturbance
now
and
then
he
paused
before
a
canvas
or
prolonged
from
one
of
the
benches
his
silent
communion
with
some
miracle
of
line
or
color
but
he
neither
looked
at
his
wife
nor
spoke
to
her
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
her
presence
claudia
was
conscious
of
keeping
a
furtive
watch
on
him
but
the
sum
total
of
her
impressions
was
negative
she
remembered
thinking
when
she
first
met
him
that
his
face
was
rather
expressionless
and
he
had
the
habit
of
silences
all
that
evening
at
the
hotel
they
talked
about
london
and
he
surprised
her
by
an
acuteness
of
observation
that
she
had
sometimes
inwardly
accused
him
of
lacking
he
seemed
to
have
seen
everything
to
have
examined
felt
compared
with
nerves
as
finely
adjusted
as
her
own
but
he
said
nothing
of
the
pictures
the
next
day
they
returned
to
the
national
gallery
and
he
began
to
study
the
paintings
in
detail
pointing
out
differences
of
technique
analyzing
and
criticising
but
still
without
summing
up
his
conclusions
he
seemed
to
have
a
sort
of
provincial
dread
of
showing
himself
too
much
impressed
claudia
s
own
sensations
were
too
complex
too
overwhelming
to
be
readily
classified
lacking
the
craftsman
s
instinct
to
steady
her
she
felt
herself
carried
off
her
feet
by
the
rush
of
incoherent
impressions
one
point
she
consciously
avoided
and
that
was
the
comparison
of
her
husband
s
work
with
what
they
were
daily
seeing
art
she
inwardly
argued
was
too
various
too
complex
dependent
on
too
many
of
feeling
and
environment
to
allow
of
its
being
judged
by
any
provisional
standard
even
the
subtleties
of
technique
must
be
modified
by
the
artist
s
changing
purpose
as
this
in
turn
is
acted
on
by
influences
of
which
he
is
himself
unconscious
how
then
was
an
unprepared
imagination
to
distinguish
between
such
varied
reflections
of
the
elusive
vision
she
took
refuge
in
a
passionate
exaggeration
of
her
own
ignorance
and
insufficiency
after
a
week
in
london
they
went
to
paris
the
exhibition
of
keniston
s
pictures
had
been
opened
a
few
days
earlier
and
as
they
drove
through
the
streets
on
the
way
to
the
station
an
impressionist
poster
here
and
there
invited
them
to
the
display
of
the
american
artist
s
work
davant
who
had
been
in
paris
for
the
opening
had
already
written
rapturously
of
the
impression
produced
enclosing
commendatory
notices
from
one
or
two
papers
she
reported
that
there
had
been
a
great
crowd
on
the
first
day
and
that
the
critics
had
been
immensely
the
kenistons
arrived
in
the
evening
and
the
next
morning
claudia
as
a
matter
of
course
asked
her
husband
at
what
time
he
meant
to
go
and
see
the
pictures
he
looked
up
absently
from
his
what
pictures
why
yours
she
said
surprised
oh
they
ll
keep
he
answered
adding
with
a
slightly
embarrassed
laugh
we
ll
give
the
other
chaps
a
show
presently
he
laid
down
his
book
and
proposed
that
they
should
go
to
the
louvre
they
spent
the
morning
there
lunched
at
a
restaurant
near
by
and
returned
to
the
gallery
in
the
afternoon
keniston
had
passed
from
inarticulateness
to
an
eager
volubility
it
was
clear
that
he
was
beginning
to
his
impressions
to
find
his
way
about
in
a
corner
of
the
great
imaginative
universe
he
seemed
extraordinarily
ready
to
impart
his
discoveries
and
claudia
felt
that
her
ignorance
served
him
as
a
convenient
buffer
against
the
terrific
impact
of
new
sensations
on
the
way
home
she
asked
when
he
meant
to
see
davant
his
answer
surprised
her
does
she
know
we
re
here
not
unless
you
ve
sent
her
word
said
claudia
with
a
touch
of
harmless
irony
that
s
all
right
then
he
returned
simply
i
want
to
wait
and
look
about
a
day
or
two
longer
she
d
want
us
to
go
with
her
and
i
d
rather
get
my
impressions
the
next
two
days
were
hampered
by
the
necessity
of
eluding
davant
claudia
under
different
circumstances
would
have
scrupled
to
share
in
this
somewhat
shabby
conspiracy
but
she
found
herself
in
a
state
of
suspended
judgment
wherein
her
husband
s
treatment
of
davant
became
for
the
moment
merely
a
clue
to
larger
meanings
they
had
been
four
days
in
paris
when
claudia
returning
one
afternoon
from
a
parenthetical
excursion
to
the
rue
de
la
paix
was
confronted
on
her
threshold
by
the
reproachful
figure
of
their
benefactress
it
was
not
to
her
however
that
davant
s
reproaches
were
addressed
keniston
it
appeared
had
borne
the
brunt
of
them
for
he
stood
leaning
against
the
mantelpiece
of
their
modest
in
that
attitude
of
convicted
negligence
when
if
ever
a
man
is
glad
to
take
refuge
behind
his
wife
claudia
had
however
no
immediate
intention
of
affording
him
such
shelter
she
wanted
to
observe
and
wait
he
s
too
impossible
cried
davant
sweeping
her
at
once
into
the
central
current
of
her
grievance
claudia
looked
from
one
to
the
other
for
not
going
to
see
you
for
not
going
to
see
his
pictures
cried
the
other
nobly
claudia
colored
and
keniston
shifted
his
position
uneasily
i
can
t
make
her
understand
he
said
turning
to
his
wife
i
don
t
care
about
myself
davant
interjected
do
then
it
s
the
only
thing
i
do
care
about
he
hurriedly
protested
i
meant
to
go
at
once
to
write
claudia
wanted
to
go
but
i
wouldn
t
let
he
looked
helplessly
about
the
pleasant
room
which
was
rapidly
burning
itself
into
claudia
s
consciousness
as
a
visible
extension
of
davant
s
claims
i
can
t
explain
he
broke
off
davant
in
turn
addressed
herself
to
claudia
people
think
it
s
so
odd
she
complained
so
many
of
the
artists
here
are
anxious
to
meet
him
they
ve
all
been
so
charming
about
the
pictures
and
several
of
our
american
friends
have
come
over
from
london
expressly
for
the
exhibition
i
told
every
one
that
he
would
be
here
for
the
opening
there
was
a
private
view
you
know
and
they
were
so
disappointed
they
wanted
to
give
him
an
ovation
and
i
didn
t
know
what
to
say
what
i
to
say
she
abruptly
ended
there
s
nothing
to
say
said
keniston
slowly
but
the
exhibition
closes
the
day
after
well
sha
n
t
close
i
shall
be
here
he
declared
with
an
effort
at
playfulness
if
they
want
to
see
me
all
these
people
you
re
kind
enough
to
mention
won
t
there
be
other
chances
but
i
wanted
them
to
see
you
your
pictures
to
hear
you
talk
about
them
explain
them
in
that
wonderful
way
i
wanted
you
to
interpret
each
other
as
professor
wildmarsh
says
oh
hang
professor
wildmarsh
said
keniston
softening
the
commination
with
a
smile
if
my
pictures
are
good
for
anything
they
oughtn
t
to
need
davant
stared
but
i
thought
that
was
what
made
them
so
interesting
she
exclaimed
keniston
looked
down
perhaps
it
was
he
murmured
there
was
an
awkward
silence
which
claudia
broke
by
saying
with
a
glance
at
her
husband
but
if
the
exhibition
is
to
remain
open
could
we
not
meet
you
there
and
perhaps
you
could
send
word
to
some
of
our
davant
brightened
like
a
child
whose
broken
toy
is
glued
together
oh
make
him
she
implored
i
ll
ask
them
to
come
in
the
afternoon
we
ll
make
it
into
a
little
tea
a
o
i
ll
send
word
at
once
to
everybody
she
gathered
up
her
beruffled
boa
and
sunshade
settling
her
plumage
like
a
reassured
bird
it
will
be
too
lovely
she
ended
in
a
murmur
but
in
the
doorway
a
new
doubt
assailed
her
you
won
t
fail
me
she
said
turning
plaintively
to
keniston
you
ll
make
him
come
keniston
i
ll
bring
him
claudia
promised
iv
when
the
next
morning
she
appeared
equipped
for
their
customary
ramble
her
husband
surprised
her
by
announcing
that
he
meant
to
stay
at
home
the
fact
is
i
m
rather
surfeited
he
said
smiling
i
suppose
my
appetite
isn
t
equal
to
such
a
plethora
i
think
i
ll
write
some
letters
and
join
you
somewhere
she
detected
the
wish
to
be
alone
and
responded
to
it
with
her
usual
readiness
i
shall
sink
to
my
proper
level
and
buy
a
bonnet
then
she
said
i
haven
t
had
time
to
take
the
edge
off
that
they
agreed
to
meet
at
the
hotel
cluny
at
and
she
set
out
alone
with
a
vague
sense
of
relief
neither
she
nor
keniston
had
made
any
direct
reference
to
davant
s
visit
but
its
effect
was
implicit
in
their
eagerness
to
avoid
each
other
claudia
accomplished
some
shopping
in
the
spirit
of
perfunctoriness
that
robs
even
new
bonnets
of
their
bloom
and
this
business
despatched
she
turned
aimlessly
into
the
wide
inviting
brightness
of
the
streets
never
had
she
felt
more
isolated
amid
that
ordered
beauty
which
gives
a
social
quality
to
the
very
stones
and
mortar
of
paris
all
about
her
were
evidences
of
an
artistic
sensibility
pervading
every
form
of
life
like
the
nervous
structure
of
the
huge
frame
a
sensibility
so
delicate
alert
and
universal
that
it
seemed
to
leave
no
room
for
obtuseness
or
error
in
such
a
medium
the
faculty
of
plastic
expression
must
develop
as
unconsciously
as
any
organ
in
its
normal
surroundings
to
be
artistic
must
cease
to
be
an
attitude
and
become
a
natural
function
to
claudia
the
significance
of
the
whole
vast
revelation
was
centred
in
the
light
it
shed
on
one
tiny
spot
of
consciousness
the
value
of
her
husband
s
work
there
are
moments
when
to
the
groping
soul
the
world
s
accumulated
experiences
are
but
across
a
private
difficulty
she
stood
hesitating
on
a
street
corner
it
was
barely
eleven
and
she
had
an
hour
to
spare
before
going
to
the
hotel
cluny
she
seemed
to
be
letting
her
inclination
float
as
it
would
on
the
of
suggestion
emanating
from
the
brilliant
complex
scene
before
her
but
suddenly
in
obedience
to
an
impulse
that
she
became
aware
of
only
in
acting
on
it
she
called
a
cab
and
drove
to
the
gallery
where
her
husband
s
pictures
were
exhibited
a
magnificent
official
in
gold
braid
sold
her
a
ticket
and
pointed
the
way
up
the
empty
stairs
his
duplicate
on
the
upper
landing
held
out
a
catalogue
with
an
air
of
recognizing
the
futility
of
the
offer
and
a
moment
later
she
found
herself
in
the
long
noiseless
impressive
room
full
of
ottomans
and
exotic
plants
it
was
clear
that
the
public
ardor
on
which
davant
had
expatiated
had
spent
itself
earlier
in
the
week
for
claudia
had
this
luxurious
apartment
to
herself
something
about
its
air
of
rich
privacy
its
diffusion
of
that
sympathetic
quality
in
other
countries
so
conspicuously
absent
from
the
public
seemed
to
emphasize
its
present
emptiness
it
was
as
though
the
flowers
the
carpet
the
lounges
surrounded
their
visitor
s
solitary
advance
with
the
mute
assurance
that
they
had
done
all
they
could
toward
making
the
thing
go
off
and
that
if
they
had
failed
it
was
simply
for
lack
of
she
stood
still
and
looked
about
her
the
pictures
struck
her
instantly
as
odd
gaps
in
the
general
harmony
it
was
that
they
had
not
they
had
not
been
pushing
aggressive
discordant
they
had
merely
effaced
themselves
she
swept
a
startled
eye
from
one
familiar
painting
to
another
the
canvases
were
all
there
and
the
frames
but
the
miracle
the
mirage
of
life
and
meaning
had
vanished
like
some
atmospheric
illusion
what
was
it
that
had
happened
and
had
it
happened
to
or
to
the
pictures
she
tried
to
rally
her
frightened
thoughts
to
push
or
coax
them
into
a
semblance
of
resistance
but
argument
was
swept
off
its
feet
by
the
huge
rush
of
a
single
conviction
the
conviction
that
the
pictures
were
bad
there
was
no
standing
up
against
that
she
felt
herself
submerged
the
stealthy
fear
that
had
been
following
her
all
these
days
had
her
by
the
throat
now
the
great
vision
of
beauty
through
which
she
had
been
moving
as
one
enchanted
was
turned
to
a
phantasmagoria
of
evil
mocking
shapes
she
hated
the
past
she
hated
its
splendor
its
power
its
wicked
magical
vitality
she
dropped
into
a
seat
and
continued
to
stare
at
the
wall
before
her
gradually
as
she
stared
there
stole
out
to
her
from
the
dimmed
humbled
canvases
a
reminder
of
what
she
had
once
seen
in
them
a
spectral
appeal
to
her
faith
to
call
them
back
to
life
what
proof
had
she
that
her
present
estimate
of
them
was
less
subjective
than
the
other
the
confused
impressions
of
the
last
few
days
were
hardly
to
be
pleaded
as
a
valid
theory
of
art
how
after
all
did
she
know
that
the
pictures
were
bad
on
what
suddenly
acquired
technical
standard
had
she
thus
decided
the
case
against
them
it
seemed
as
though
it
were
a
standard
outside
of
herself
as
though
some
unheeded
inner
sense
were
gradually
making
her
aware
of
the
presence
in
that
empty
room
of
a
critical
intelligence
that
was
giving
out
a
subtle
effluence
of
disapproval
the
fancy
was
so
vivid
that
to
shake
it
off
she
rose
and
began
to
move
about
again
in
the
middle
of
the
room
stood
a
monumental
divan
surmounted
by
a
of
palms
and
azaleas
as
claudia
s
muffled
wanderings
carried
her
around
the
angle
of
this
seat
she
saw
that
its
farther
side
was
occupied
by
the
figure
of
a
man
who
sat
with
his
hands
resting
on
his
stick
and
his
head
bowed
upon
them
she
gave
a
little
cry
and
her
husband
rose
and
faced
her
instantly
the
live
point
of
consciousness
was
shifted
and
she
became
aware
that
the
quality
of
the
pictures
no
longer
mattered
it
was
what
thought
of
them
that
counted
her
life
hung
on
that
they
looked
at
each
other
a
moment
in
silence
such
concussions
are
not
apt
to
flash
into
immediate
speech
at
length
he
said
simply
i
didn
t
know
you
were
coming
she
colored
as
though
he
had
charged
her
with
something
underhand
i
didn
t
mean
to
she
stammered
but
i
was
too
early
for
our
appointment
her
word
s
cast
a
revealing
glare
on
the
situation
neither
of
them
looked
at
the
pictures
but
to
claudia
those
unobtruding
presences
seemed
suddenly
to
press
upon
them
and
force
them
apart
keniston
glanced
at
his
watch
it
s
twelve
o
clock
he
said
shall
we
go
on
v
at
the
door
he
called
a
cab
and
put
her
in
it
then
drawing
out
his
watch
again
he
said
abruptly
i
believe
i
ll
let
you
go
alone
i
ll
join
you
at
the
hotel
in
time
for
she
wondered
for
a
moment
if
he
meant
to
return
to
the
gallery
but
looking
back
as
she
drove
off
she
saw
him
walk
rapidly
away
in
the
opposite
direction
the
cabman
had
carried
her
to
the
hotel
cluny
before
she
realized
where
she
was
going
and
cried
out
to
him
to
turn
home
there
was
an
acute
irony
in
this
mechanical
prolongation
of
the
quest
of
beauty
she
had
had
enough
of
it
too
much
of
it
her
one
longing
was
to
escape
to
hide
herself
away
from
its
implacable
light
at
the
hotel
alone
in
her
room
a
few
tears
came
to
soften
her
seared
vision
but
her
mood
was
too
tense
to
be
eased
by
weeping
her
whole
being
was
centred
in
the
longing
to
know
what
her
husband
thought
their
short
exchange
of
words
had
after
all
told
her
nothing
she
had
guessed
a
faint
resentment
at
her
unexpected
appearance
but
that
might
merely
imply
a
dawning
sense
on
his
part
of
being
furtively
watched
and
criticised
she
had
sometimes
wondered
if
he
was
never
conscious
of
her
observation
there
were
moments
when
it
seemed
to
radiate
from
her
in
visible
waves
perhaps
after
all
he
was
aware
of
it
on
his
guard
against
it
as
a
lurking
knife
behind
the
thick
curtain
of
his
complacency
and
he
must
have
caught
the
gleam
of
the
blade
claudia
had
not
reached
the
age
when
pity
is
the
first
chord
to
vibrate
in
contact
with
any
revelation
of
failure
her
one
hope
had
been
that
keniston
should
be
enough
to
face
the
truth
whatever
it
turned
out
to
be
she
wanted
him
to
measure
himself
with
it
but
as
his
image
rose
before
her
she
felt
a
sudden
longing
to
thrust
herself
between
him
and
disaster
her
eagerness
to
see
him
tested
by
circumstances
seemed
now
like
a
cruel
scientific
curiosity
she
saw
in
a
flash
of
sympathy
that
he
would
need
her
most
if
he
fell
beneath
his
fate
he
did
not
after
all
return
for
luncheon
and
when
she
came
from
her
solitary
meal
their
was
still
untenanted
she
permitted
herself
no
sensational
fears
for
she
could
not
at
the
height
of
apprehension
figure
keniston
as
yielding
to
any
tragic
impulse
but
the
lengthening
hours
brought
an
uneasiness
that
was
fuel
to
her
pity
suddenly
she
heard
the
clock
strike
five
it
was
the
hour
at
which
they
had
promised
to
meet
davant
at
the
gallery
the
hour
of
the
claudia
rose
and
went
to
the
window
straining
for
a
glimpse
of
her
husband
in
the
crowded
street
could
it
be
that
he
had
forgotten
her
had
gone
to
the
gallery
without
her
or
had
something
happened
that
veiled
something
which
for
the
last
hour
had
grimly
hovered
on
the
outskirts
of
her
mind
she
heard
a
hand
on
the
door
and
keniston
entered
as
she
turned
to
meet
him
her
whole
being
was
swept
forward
on
a
great
wave
of
pity
she
was
so
sure
now
that
he
must
know
but
he
confronted
her
with
a
glance
of
preoccupied
brightness
her
first
impression
was
that
she
had
never
seen
him
so
vividly
so
expressively
pleased
if
he
needed
her
it
was
not
to
bind
up
his
wounds
he
gave
her
a
smile
which
was
clearly
the
lingering
reflection
of
some
inner
light
i
didn
t
mean
to
be
so
late
he
said
tossing
aside
his
hat
and
the
little
red
volume
that
served
as
a
clue
to
his
explorations
i
turned
in
to
the
louvre
for
a
minute
after
i
left
you
this
morning
and
the
place
fairly
swallowed
me
up
i
couldn
t
get
away
from
it
i
ve
been
there
ever
he
threw
himself
into
a
chair
and
glanced
about
for
his
pipe
it
takes
time
he
continued
musingly
to
get
at
them
to
make
out
what
they
re
saying
the
big
fellows
i
mean
they
re
not
a
communicative
lot
at
first
i
couldn
t
make
much
out
of
their
lingo
it
was
too
different
from
mine
but
gradually
by
picking
up
a
hint
here
and
there
and
piecing
them
together
i
ve
begun
to
understand
and
by
jove
i
got
one
or
two
of
the
old
chaps
by
the
throat
and
fairly
turned
them
inside
out
made
them
deliver
up
their
last
he
lifted
a
brilliant
eye
to
her
lord
it
was
tremendous
he
declared
he
had
found
his
pipe
and
was
musingly
filling
it
claudia
waited
in
silence
at
first
he
began
again
i
was
afraid
their
language
was
too
hard
for
me
that
i
should
never
quite
know
what
they
were
driving
at
they
seemed
to
me
to
be
bent
on
shutting
me
out
but
i
was
bound
i
wouldn
t
be
beaten
and
now
he
paused
a
moment
to
strike
a
match
when
i
went
to
look
at
those
things
of
mine
it
all
came
over
me
in
a
flash
by
jove
it
was
as
if
i
d
made
them
all
into
a
big
bonfire
to
light
me
on
my
road
his
wife
was
trembling
with
a
kind
of
sacred
terror
she
had
been
afraid
to
pray
for
light
for
him
and
here
he
was
joyfully
casting
his
whole
past
upon
the
pyre
is
there
nothing
left
she
faltered
nothing
left
there
s
everything
he
exulted
why
here
i
am
not
much
over
forty
and
i
ve
found
out
already
already
he
stood
up
and
began
to
move
excitedly
about
the
room
my
god
suppose
i
d
never
known
suppose
i
d
gone
on
painting
things
like
that
forever
why
i
feel
like
those
chaps
at
revivalist
meetings
when
they
get
up
and
say
they
re
saved
won
t
somebody
please
start
a
hymn
claudia
with
a
tremulous
joy
was
letting
herself
go
on
the
strong
current
of
his
emotion
but
it
had
not
yet
carried
her
beyond
her
depth
and
suddenly
she
felt
hard
ground
underfoot
mrs
davant
she
exclaimed
he
stared
as
though
suddenly
recalled
from
a
long
distance
mrs
davant
we
were
to
have
met
her
this
afternoon
now
at
the
gallery
oh
that
s
all
right
i
put
a
stop
to
that
i
went
to
see
her
after
i
left
you
i
explained
it
all
to
all
i
told
her
i
was
going
to
begin
all
over
claudia
s
heart
gave
a
forward
bound
and
then
sank
back
hopelessly
but
the
panels
that
s
all
right
too
i
told
her
about
the
panels
he
reassured
her
you
told
her
that
i
can
t
paint
them
now
she
doesn
t
understand
of
course
but
she
s
the
best
little
woman
and
she
trusts
she
could
have
wept
for
joy
at
his
exquisite
obtuseness
but
that
isn
t
all
she
wailed
it
doesn
t
matter
how
much
you
ve
explained
to
her
it
doesn
t
do
away
with
the
fact
that
we
re
living
on
those
panels
living
on
them
on
the
money
that
she
paid
you
to
paint
them
isn
t
that
what
brought
us
here
and
if
you
mean
to
do
as
you
say
to
begin
all
over
again
how
in
the
world
are
we
ever
to
pay
her
back
her
husband
turned
on
her
an
inspired
eye
there
s
only
one
way
that
i
know
of
he
imperturbably
declared
and
that
s
to
stay
out
here
till
i
learn
how
to
paint
copy
a
dialogue
ambrose

the
winter
twilight

falling
a
lamp

been
lit
there
is
a
fire
on
the
hearth
and
the
room
is
pleasantly
dim
and
books
are
scattered
everywhere
mostly
with
autograph
inscriptions
from
the
author
and
a
large
portrait

strewn
about

takes
up
one
of

it
strange
that
people

dollars

t
scruple
to
beg
for

autograph

week

but
it

so
beautiful
to

here

and
listening

in
the
night
and
to
feel
that

must
have
you

in
the
morning
for
you

at
the
age
when

morning
she

letters

notes
of
what

dale
my
dear
friend
this
is
kind
she
looks
over
her
shoulder
at
hilda
who
vanishes
through
the
door
to
the
left
the
papers
announced
your
arrival
but
i
hardly
hoped
whose
stare
is
seen
to
conceal
a
deeper
embarrassment
you
hadn
t
forgotten
me
then
delicious
do
forget
that
you
re
public
property
forgotten
i
mean
that
we
were
old
friends
such
old
friends
may
i
remind
you
that
it
s
nearly
twenty
years
since
we
ve
met
or
do
you
find
cold
reminiscences
indigestible
on
the
contrary
i
ve
come
to
ask
you
for
a
dish
of
them
we
ll
warm
them
up
together
you
re
my
first
visit
how
perfect
of
you
so
few
men
visit
their
women
friends
in
chronological
order
or
at
least
they
generally
do
it
the
other
way
round
beginning
with
the
present
day
and
working
back
if
there
s
time
to
prehistoric
woman
but
when
prehistoric
woman
has
become
historic
woman
oh
it
s
the
reflection
of
my
glory
that
has
guided
you
here
then
it
s
a
spirit
in
my
feet
that
has
led
me
at
the
first
opportunity
to
the
most
delightful
spot
i
know
oh
the
first
opportunity
i
might
have
seen
you
very
often
before
but
never
just
in
the
right
way
is
this
the
right
way
it
depends
on
you
to
make
it
so
what
a
responsibility
what
shall
i
do
talk
to
me
make
me
think
you
re
a
little
glad
to
see
me
give
me
some
tea
and
a
cigarette
and
say
you
re
out
to
everyone
else
is
that
all
she
hands
him
a
cup
of
tea
the
cigarettes
are
at
your
elbow
and
do
you
think
i
shouldn
t
have
been
glad
to
see
you
before
no
i
think
i
should
have
been
too
glad
to
see
you
dear
me
what
precautions
i
hope
you
always
wear
goloshes
when
it
looks
like
rain
and
never
by
any
chance
expose
yourself
to
a
draught
but
i
had
an
idea
that
poets
courted
the
emotions
do
novelists
if
you
ask
on
paper
just
so
that
s
safest
my
best
things
about
the
sea
have
been
written
on
shore
he
looks
at
her
thoughtfully
but
it
wouldn
t
have
suited
us
in
the
old
days
would
it
dale
sighing
when
we
were
real
people
real
people
are
now
i
died
years
ago
what
you
see
before
you
is
a
figment
of
the
reporter
s
brain
a
monster
manufactured
out
of
newspaper
paragraphs
with
ink
in
its
veins
a
keen
sense
of
copyright
is
nearest
approach
to
an
emotion
sighing
ah
well
yes
as
you
say
we
re
public
property
if
one
shared
equally
with
the
public
but
the
last
shred
of
my
identity
is
gone
most
people
would
be
glad
to
part
with
theirs
on
such
terms
i
have
followed
your
work
with
immense
interest
is
a
masterpiece
i
read
it
last
summer
when
it
first
came
out
dale
with
a
shade
less
warmth
has
been
out
three
years
oh
by
jove
no
surely
not
but
one
is
so
overwhelmed
one
loses
count
why
have
you
never
sent
me
your
books
for
that
very
reason
deprecatingly
you
know
i
didn
t
mean
it
for
you
and
first
book
do
you
remember
was
dedicated
to
you
much
interested
have
you
a
copy
still
by
any
chance
the
first
edition
i
mean
mine
was
stolen
years
ago
do
you
think
you
could
put
your
hand
on
it
dale
taking
a
small
shabby
book
from
the
table
at
her
side
it
s
here
eagerly
may
i
have
it
ah
thanks
this
is
interesting
the
last
copy
sold
in
london
for
and
they
tell
me
the
next
will
fetch
twice
as
much
it
s
quite
i
know
that
a
pause
she
takes
the
book
from
him
opens
it
and
reads
half
to
herself
much
we
two
have
seen
together
of
other
eyes
unwist
dear
as
in
days
of
leafless
weather
the
willow
s
saffron
mist
strange
as
the
hour
when
hesper
swings
in
beryl
green
while
overhead
on
dalliant
wings
the
daylight
hangs
serene
and
thrilling
as
a
meteor
s
fall
through
depths
of
lonely
sky
when
each
to
each
two
watchers
call
i
saw
it
so
did
thin
thin
the
troubadour
tinkle
odd
how
little
promise
there
is
in
first
volumes
dale
with
irresistible
emphasis
i
thought
there
was
a
distinct
promise
in
this
seeing
his
mistake
ah
the
one
you
would
never
let
me
fulfil
sentimentally
how
inexorable
you
were
you
never
dedicated
a
book
to
i
hadn
t
begun
to
write
when
we
were
dedicating
things
to
each
other
not
for
the
public
but
you
wrote
for
me
and
wonderful
as
you
are
you
ve
never
written
anything
since
that
i
care
for
half
as
much
as
dale
interested
well
your
letters
dale
in
a
changed
voice
my
letters
do
you
remember
them
when
i
don
t
i
reread
them
dale
incredulous
you
have
them
still
unguardedly
you
haven
t
mine
then
dale
playfully
oh
you
were
a
celebrity
already
of
course
i
kept
them
smiling
think
what
they
are
worth
now
i
always
keep
them
locked
up
in
my
safe
over
there
she
indicates
a
cabinet
after
a
pause
i
always
carry
yours
with
me
dale
laughing
you
wherever
i
go
a
longer
pause
she
looks
at
him
fixedly
i
have
them
with
me
now
dale
agitated
you
have
them
with
you
now
embarrassed
why
not
one
never
knows
never
knows
humorously
gad
when
the
may
come
round
you
forget
i
m
a
married
man
ah
yes
sits
down
beside
her
i
speak
to
you
as
i
couldn
t
to
anyone
else
without
deserving
a
kicking
you
know
how
it
all
came
about
a
pause
you
ll
bear
witness
that
it
wasn
t
till
you
denied
me
all
hope
dale
a
little
breathless
yes
yes
till
you
sent
me
from
you
it
s
so
easy
to
be
heroic
when
one
is
young
one
doesn
t
realize
how
long
life
is
going
to
last
afterward
musing
nor
what
weary
work
it
is
gathering
up
the
fragments
but
the
time
comes
when
one
sends
for
the
and
has
the
bits
riveted
together
and
turns
the
cracked
side
to
the
wall
and
denies
that
the
article
was
ever
damaged
eh
well
the
great
thing
you
see
is
to
keep
one
s
self
out
of
reach
of
the
housemaid
s
brush
a
pause
if
you
re
married
you
can
t
always
smiling
don
t
you
hate
to
be
taken
down
and
dusted
dale
with
intention
you
forget
how
long
ago
my
husband
died
it
s
fifteen
years
since
i
ve
been
an
object
of
interest
to
anybody
but
the
public
smiling
the
only
one
of
your
admirers
to
whom
you
ve
ever
given
the
least
encouragement
say
rather
the
most
easily
pleased
or
the
only
one
you
cared
to
please
ah
you
kept
my
letters
gravely
is
that
a
challenge
look
here
then
he
drams
a
packet
from
his
pocket
and
holds
it
out
to
her
dale
taking
the
packet
and
looking
at
him
earnestly
why
have
you
brought
me
these
i
didn
t
bring
them
they
came
because
i
came
that
s
all
tentatively
are
we
unwelcome
dale
who
has
undone
the
packet
and
does
not
appear
to
hear
him
the
very
first
i
ever
wrote
you
the
day
after
we
met
at
the
concert
how
on
earth
did
you
happen
to
keep
it
she
glances
over
it
how
perfectly
absurd
well
it
s
not
a
compromising
document
i
m
afraid
none
of
them
are
dale
quickly
is
it
to
that
they
owe
their
immunity
because
one
could
leave
them
about
like
safety
matches
ah
here
s
another
i
remember
i
wrote
that
the
day
after
we
went
skating
together
for
the
first
time
she
reads
it
slowly
how
odd
how
very
odd
what
why
it
s
the
most
curious
thing
i
had
a
letter
of
this
kind
to
do
the
other
day
in
the
novel
i
m
at
work
on
now
the
letter
of
a
woman
who
is
just
just
beginning
yes
just
beginning
and
do
you
know
i
find
the
best
phrase
in
it
the
phrase
i
somehow
regarded
as
the
fruit
of
well
of
all
my
subsequent
discoveries
is
simply
plagiarized
word
for
word
from
this
eagerly
i
told
you
so
you
were
all
there
dale
critically
but
the
rest
of
it
s
poorly
done
very
poorly
reads
the
letter
over
h
m
i
didn
t
know
how
to
leave
off
it
takes
me
forever
to
get
out
of
the
door
gayly
perhaps
i
was
there
to
prevent
you
after
a
pause
i
wonder
what
i
said
in
return
dale
interested
shall
we
look
she
rises
shall
we
really
i
have
them
all
here
you
know
she
goes
toward
the
cabinet
following
her
with
repressed
eagerness
oh
all
dale
throws
open
the
door
of
the
cabinet
revealing
a
number
of
packets
don
t
you
believe
me
now
good
heavens
how
i
must
have
repeated
myself
but
then
you
were
so
very
deaf
dale
takes
out
a
packet
and
returns
to
her
seat
ventnor
extends
an
impatient
hand
for
the
letters
no
no
wait
i
want
to
find
your
answer
to
the
one
i
was
just
reading
after
a
pause
here
it
is
yes
i
thought
so
what
did
you
think
dale
triumphantly
i
thought
it
was
the
one
in
which
you
quoted
mercy
did
i
things
i
don
t
wonder
you
were
cruel
ah
and
here
s
the
other
the
one
i
the
one
i
didn
t
answer
for
a
long
time
do
you
remember
with
emotion
do
i
remember
i
wrote
it
the
morning
after
we
heard
dale
disappointed
no
no
wasn
t
the
one
i
didn
t
answer
here
this
is
the
one
i
mean
takes
it
curiously
ah
h
m
this
is
very
like
unrolling
a
mummy
he
glances
at
her
with
a
live
grain
of
wheat
in
it
perhaps
oh
by
jove
what
why
this
is
the
one
i
made
a
sonnet
out
of
afterward
by
jove
i
d
forgotten
where
that
idea
came
from
you
may
know
the
lines
perhaps
they
re
in
the
fourth
volume
of
my
complete
edition
it
s
the
thing
beginning
came
to
me
with
unrelenting
eyes
one
of
my
best
i
rather
fancy
of
course
here
it
s
very
crudely
put
the
values
aren
t
brought
out
ah
this
touch
is
good
though
very
good
h
m
i
daresay
there
might
be
other
material
he
glances
toward
the
cabinet
dale
drily
the
live
grain
of
wheat
as
you
said
ah
well
my
first
harvest
was
sown
on
rocky
ground
i
plant
for
the
fowls
of
the
air
rising
and
walking
toward
the
cabinet
when
can
i
come
and
carry
off
all
this
rubbish
carry
it
off
embarrassed
my
dear
lady
surely
between
you
and
me
explicitness
is
a
burden
you
must
see
that
these
letters
of
ours
can
t
be
left
to
take
their
chance
like
an
ordinary
correspondence
you
said
yourself
we
were
public
property
to
take
their
chance
do
you
suppose
that
in
my
keeping
your
letters
take
any
chances
suddenly
do
mine
in
yours
still
more
embarrassed
helen
he
takes
a
turn
through
the
room
you
force
me
to
remind
you
that
you
and
i
are
differently
situated
that
in
a
moment
of
madness
i
sacrificed
the
only
right
you
ever
gave
me
the
right
to
love
you
better
than
any
other
woman
in
the
world
a
pause
she
says
nothing
and
he
continues
with
increasing
difficulty
you
asked
me
just
now
why
i
carried
your
letters
about
with
me
kept
them
literally
in
my
own
hands
well
suppose
it
s
to
be
sure
of
their
not
falling
into
some
one
else
s
oh
throws
himself
into
a
chair
for
god
s
sake
don
t
pity
me
dale
after
a
long
pause
am
i
dull
or
are
you
trying
to
say
that
you
want
to
give
me
back
my
letters
starting
up
i
give
you
back
god
forbid
your
letters
not
for
the
world
the
only
thing
i
have
left
but
you
can
t
dream
that
in
hands
dale
suddenly
you
want
yours
then
repressing
his
eagerness
my
dear
friend
if
i
d
ever
dreamed
that
you
d
kept
them
dale
accusingly
you
want
them
a
pause
he
makes
a
deprecatory
gesture
why
should
they
be
less
safe
with
me
than
mine
with
you
never
forfeited
the
right
to
keep
them
after
another
pause
it
s
compensation
enough
almost
to
have
you
reproach
me
he
moves
nearer
to
her
but
she
makes
no
response
you
forget
that
i
ve
forfeited
my
rights
even
that
of
letting
you
keep
my
letters
you
want
them
she
rises
throws
all
the
letters
into
the
cabinet
locks
the
door
and
puts
the
key
in
her
pocket
there
s
my
answer
helen
ah
i
paid
dearly
enough
for
the
right
to
keep
them
and
i
mean
to
she
turns
to
him
passionately
have
you
ever
asked
yourself
how
i
paid
for
it
with
what
months
and
years
of
solitude
what
indifference
to
flattery
what
resistance
to
affection
oh
don
t
smile
because
i
said
affection
and
not
love
affection
s
a
warm
cloak
in
cold
weather
and
i
been
cold
and
i
shall
keep
on
growing
colder
don
t
talk
to
me
about
living
in
the
hearts
of
my
readers
we
both
know
what
kind
of
a
domicile
that
is
why
before
long
i
shall
become
a
classic
bound
in
sets
and
kept
on
the
top
brr
doesn
t
that
sound
freezing
i
foresee
the
day
when
i
shall
be
as
lonely
as
an
etruscan
museum
she
breaks
into
a
laugh
that
s
what
i
ve
paid
for
the
right
to
keep
your
letters
she
holds
out
her
hand
and
now
give
me
mine
yours
dale
haughtily
yes
i
claim
them
in
the
same
tone
on
what
ground
hear
the
man
because
i
wrote
them
of
course
but
it
seems
to
me
that
under
your
inspiration
i
admit
i
also
wrote
mine
oh
i
don
t
dispute
their
authenticity
it
s
yours
i
deny
mine
you
voluntarily
ceased
to
be
the
man
who
wrote
me
those
letters
you
ve
admitted
as
much
you
traded
paper
for
flesh
and
blood
i
don
t
dispute
your
wisdom
only
you
must
hold
to
your
bargain
the
letters
are
all
mine
groping
between
two
tones
your
arguments
are
as
convincing
as
ever
he
hazards
a
faint
laugh
you
re
a
marvellous
dialectician
but
if
we
re
going
to
settle
the
matter
in
the
spirit
of
an
arbitration
treaty
why
there
are
accepted
conventions
in
such
cases
it
s
an
odious
way
to
put
it
but
since
you
won
t
help
me
one
of
them
is
one
of
them
is
that
it
is
usual
that
technically
i
mean
the
letter
belongs
to
its
writer
dale
after
a
pause
such
letters
as
such
letters
especially
but
you
couldn
t
have
written
them
if
i
hadn
t
been
willing
to
read
them
surely
there
s
more
of
myself
in
them
than
of
you
surely
there
s
nothing
in
which
a
man
puts
more
of
himself
than
in
his
dale
with
emotion
but
a
woman
s
are
like
her
child
they
belong
to
her
more
than
to
anybody
else
and
a
man
s
dale
with
sudden
violence
are
all
he
risks
there
take
them
she
flings
the
key
of
the
cabinet
at
his
feet
and
sinks
into
a
chair
starts
as
though
to
pick
up
the
key
then
approaches
and
bends
over
her
helen
oh
helen
dale
she
yields
her
hands
to
him
murmuring
paul
suddenly
she
straightens
herself
and
draws
back
illuminated
what
a
fool
i
am
i
see
it
all
now
you
want
them
for
your
memoirs
disconcerted
helen
dale
agitated
come
come
the
rule
is
to
unmask
when
the
signal
s
given
you
want
them
for
your
memoirs
with
a
forced
laugh
what
makes
you
think
so
dale
triumphantly
because
want
them
for
mine
in
a
changed
tone
ah
he
moves
away
from
her
and
leans
against
the
mantelpiece
she
remains
seated
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
him
i
wonder
i
didn
t
see
it
sooner
your
reasons
were
lame
enough
ironically
yours
were
masterly
you
re
the
more
accomplished
actor
of
the
two
i
was
completely
deceived
oh
i
m
a
novelist
i
can
keep
up
that
sort
of
thing
for
five
hundred
pages
i
congratulate
you
a
pause
dale
moving
to
her
seat
behind
the
i
ve
never
offered
you
any
tea
she
bends
over
the
kettle
why
don
t
you
take
your
letters
because
you
ve
been
clever
enough
to
make
it
impossible
for
me
he
picks
up
the
key
and
hands
it
to
her
then
abruptly
was
it
all
acting
just
now
by
what
right
do
you
ask
by
right
of
renouncing
my
claim
to
my
letters
keep
them
and
tell
me
i
give
you
back
your
claim
and
i
refuse
to
tell
you
sadly
ah
helen
if
you
deceived
me
you
deceived
yourself
also
what
does
it
matter
now
that
we
re
both
undeceived
i
played
a
losing
game
that
s
all
why
losing
since
all
the
letters
are
yours
the
letters
slowly
i
d
forgotten
the
letters
exultant
ah
i
knew
you
d
end
by
telling
me
the
truth
the
truth
where
the
truth
half
to
herself
i
thought
i
was
lying
when
i
began
but
the
lies
turned
into
truth
as
i
uttered
them
she
looks
at
ventnor
i
want
your
letters
for
my
memoirs
i
think
i
d
kept
them
for
that
purpose
and
i
wanted
to
get
mine
back
for
the
same
reason
but
now
she
puts
out
her
hand
and
picks
up
some
of
her
letters
which
are
lying
scattered
on
the
table
near
her
how
fresh
they
seem
and
how
they
take
me
back
to
the
time
when
we
lived
instead
of
writing
about
life
smiling
the
time
when
we
didn
t
prepare
our
impromptu
effects
beforehand
and
copyright
our
remarks
about
the
weather
or
keep
our
epigrams
in
cold
storage
and
our
adjectives
under
lock
and
key
when
our
emotions
weren
t
worth
ten
cents
a
word
and
a
signature
wasn
t
an
autograph
ah
helen
after
all
there
s
nothing
like
the
exhilaration
of
spending
one
s
capital
of
wasting
it
you
mean
she
points
to
the
letters
do
you
suppose
we
could
have
written
a
word
of
these
if
we
d
known
we
were
putting
our
dreams
out
at
interest
she
sits
musing
with
her
eyes
on
the
fire
and
he
watches
her
in
silence
paul
do
you
remember
the
deserted
garden
we
sometimes
used
to
walk
in
the
old
garden
with
the
high
wall
at
the
end
of
the
village
street
the
garden
with
the
ruined
and
the
arbor
why
i
remember
every
weed
in
the
paths
and
every
patch
of
moss
on
the
walls
well
i
went
back
there
the
other
day
the
village
is
immensely
improved
there
s
a
new
hotel
with
and
a
trolley
in
the
main
street
and
the
garden
has
been
turned
into
a
public
park
where
excursionists
sit
on
benches
admiring
the
statue
of
an
abolitionist
an
abolitionist
how
appropriate
and
the
man
who
sold
the
garden
has
made
a
fortune
that
he
doesn
t
know
how
to
spend
rising
impulsively
helen
he
approaches
and
lays
his
hand
on
her
letters
let
s
sacrifice
our
fortune
and
keep
the
excursionists
out
dale
with
a
responsive
movement
paul
do
you
really
mean
it
gayly
mean
it
why
i
feel
like
a
landed
proprietor
already
it
s
more
than
a
garden
it
s
a
park
it
s
more
than
a
park
it
s
a
world
as
long
as
we
keep
it
to
ourselves
ah
yes
even
the
pyramids
look
small
when
one
sees
a
cook
s
tourist
on
top
of
them
he
takes
the
key
from
the
table
unlocks
the
cabinet
and
brings
out
his
letters
which
he
lays
beside
hers
shall
we
burn
the
key
to
our
garden
ah
then
it
will
indeed
be
boundless
watching
him
while
he
throws
the
letters
into
the
fire
turning
back
to
her
with
a
smile
but
not
too
big
for
us
to
find
each
other
in
since
we
shall
be
the
only
people
there
he
takes
both
her
hands
and
they
look
at
each
other
a
moment
in
silence
then
he
goes
out
by
the
door
to
the
right
as
he
reaches
the
door
she
takes
a
step
toward
him
impulsively
then
turning
back
she
leans
against
the
quietly
watching
the
letters
burn
the
rembrandt
you
re
artistic
my
cousin
eleanor
copt
began
of
all
eleanor
s
exordiums
it
is
the
one
i
most
dread
when
she
tells
me
i
m
so
clever
i
know
this
is
merely
the
preamble
to
inviting
me
to
meet
the
last
literary
obscurity
of
the
moment
a
trial
to
be
evaded
or
endured
as
circumstances
dictate
whereas
her
calling
me
artistic
fatally
connotes
the
request
to
visit
in
her
company
some
distressed
gentlewoman
whose
future
hangs
on
my
valuation
of
her
old
saxe
or
of
her
grandfather
s
marc
antonios
time
was
when
i
attempted
to
resist
these
compulsions
of
eleanor
s
but
i
soon
learned
that
short
of
actual
flight
there
was
no
refuge
from
her
beneficent
despotism
it
is
not
always
easy
for
the
curator
of
a
museum
to
abandon
his
post
on
the
plea
of
escaping
a
pretty
cousin
s
importunities
and
eleanor
aware
of
my
predicament
is
none
too
magnanimous
to
take
advantage
of
it
magnanimity
is
in
fact
not
in
eleanor
s
line
the
virtues
she
once
explained
to
me
are
like
bonnets
the
very
ones
that
look
best
on
other
people
may
not
happen
to
suit
one
s
own
particular
style
and
she
added
with
a
slight
deflection
of
metaphor
that
none
of
the
virtues
ever
fitted
her
they
all
pinched
somewhere
and
she
d
given
up
trying
to
wear
them
therefore
when
she
said
to
me
you
re
emphasizing
the
conjunction
with
a
tap
of
her
dripping
umbrella
eleanor
is
out
in
all
weathers
the
elements
are
as
powerless
against
her
as
man
i
merely
stipulated
it
s
not
old
saxe
again
she
shook
her
head
reassuringly
a
picture
a
rembrandt
good
lord
why
not
a
leonardo
well
she
smiled
that
of
course
depends
on
on
me
on
your
attribution
i
dare
say
fontage
would
consent
to
the
change
though
she
s
very
a
gleam
of
hope
came
to
me
and
i
pronounced
one
can
t
judge
of
a
picture
in
this
of
course
not
i
m
coming
for
you
i
ve
an
engagement
i
ll
come
before
or
after
your
the
afternoon
paper
lay
at
my
elbow
and
i
contrived
a
furtive
consultation
of
the
it
said
rain
and
i
answered
briskly
all
right
then
come
at
ten
rapidly
calculating
that
the
clouds
on
which
i
counted
might
lift
by
noon
my
ingenuity
failed
of
its
due
reward
for
the
heavens
as
if
in
league
with
my
cousin
emptied
themselves
before
morning
and
punctually
at
ten
eleanor
and
the
sun
appeared
together
in
my
office
i
hardly
listened
as
we
descended
the
museum
steps
and
got
into
eleanor
s
hansom
to
her
vivid
of
the
case
i
guessed
beforehand
that
the
lady
we
were
about
to
visit
had
lapsed
by
the
most
distressful
degrees
from
opulence
to
a
that
her
grandfather
if
he
had
not
been
minister
to
france
had
signed
the
declaration
of
independence
that
the
rembrandt
was
an
heirloom
sole
remnant
of
disbanded
treasures
that
for
years
its
possessor
had
been
unwilling
to
part
with
it
and
that
even
now
the
question
of
its
disposal
must
be
approached
with
the
most
diplomatic
obliquity
previous
experience
had
taught
me
that
all
eleanor
s
cases
presented
a
harrowing
similarity
of
detail
no
circumstance
tending
to
excite
the
spectator
s
sympathy
and
involve
his
action
was
omitted
from
the
history
of
her
beneficiaries
the
lights
and
shades
were
indeed
so
skilfully
adjusted
that
any
impartial
expression
of
opinion
took
on
the
hue
of
cruelty
i
could
have
produced
closetfuls
of
heirlooms
in
attestation
of
this
fact
for
it
is
one
more
mark
of
eleanor
s
competence
that
her
friends
usually
pay
the
interest
on
her
philanthropy
my
one
hope
was
that
in
this
case
the
object
being
a
picture
might
reasonably
be
rated
beyond
my
means
and
as
our
cab
drew
up
before
a
blistered
i
formed
the
resolve
to
place
an
extreme
valuation
on
fontage
s
rembrandt
it
is
eleanor
s
fault
if
she
is
sometimes
fought
with
her
own
weapons
the
house
stood
in
one
of
those
shabby
new
york
streets
that
seem
resignedly
awaiting
demolition
it
was
the
kind
of
house
that
in
its
high
days
must
have
had
a
with
a
bronze
in
it
the
had
been
replaced
by
a
plumber
s
and
one
might
conceive
the
bronze
to
have
gravitated
to
the
limbo
where
mexican
onyx
tables
and
in
await
the
first
signs
of
our
next
aesthetic
reaction
eleanor
swept
me
through
a
hall
that
smelled
of
poverty
up
unlit
stairs
to
a
bare
slit
of
a
room
and
she
must
leave
this
in
a
month
she
whispered
across
her
knock
i
had
prepared
myself
for
the
limp
widow
s
weed
of
a
woman
that
one
figures
in
such
a
setting
and
confronted
abruptly
with
fontage
s
erectness
i
had
the
disconcerting
sense
that
i
was
somehow
in
her
presence
at
my
own
solicitation
i
instinctively
charged
eleanor
with
this
reversal
of
the
situation
but
a
moment
later
i
saw
it
must
be
ascribed
to
a
something
about
fontage
that
precluded
the
possibility
of
her
asking
any
one
a
favor
it
was
not
that
she
was
of
forbidding
or
even
majestic
demeanor
but
that
one
guessed
under
her
aquiline
prettiness
a
dignity
nervously
on
guard
against
the
petty
betrayal
of
her
surroundings
the
room
was
unconcealably
poor
the
little
faded
relics
the
ancestral
silhouettes
the
after
raphael
and
correggio
grouped
in
a
vain
attempt
to
hide
the
most
obvious
stains
on
the
served
only
to
accentuate
the
contrast
of
a
past
evidently
diversified
by
foreign
travel
and
the
enjoyment
of
the
arts
even
fontage
s
dress
had
the
air
of
being
a
last
expedient
the
ultimate
outcome
of
a
ingenuity
in
darning
and
turning
one
felt
that
all
the
poor
lady
s
barriers
were
falling
save
that
of
her
impregnable
manner
to
this
manner
i
found
myself
conveying
my
appreciation
of
being
admitted
to
a
view
of
the
rembrandt
fontage
s
smile
took
my
homage
for
granted
it
is
always
she
conceded
a
privilege
to
be
in
the
presence
of
the
great
her
slim
wrinkled
hand
waved
me
to
a
dusky
canvas
near
the
window
it
s
interesting
dear
fontage
i
heard
eleanor
exclaiming
and
my
cousin
will
be
able
to
tell
you
exactly
eleanor
in
my
presence
always
admits
that
she
knows
nothing
about
art
but
she
gives
the
impression
that
this
is
merely
because
she
hasn
t
had
time
to
look
into
the
matter
and
has
had
me
to
do
it
for
her
fontage
seated
herself
without
speaking
as
though
fearful
that
a
breath
might
disturb
my
communion
with
the
masterpiece
i
felt
that
she
thought
eleanor
s
reassuring
ejaculations
and
in
this
i
was
of
one
mind
with
her
for
the
impossibility
of
telling
her
exactly
what
i
thought
of
her
rembrandt
had
become
clear
to
me
at
a
glance
my
cousin
s
vivacities
began
to
languish
and
the
silence
seemed
to
shape
itself
into
a
receptacle
for
my
verdict
i
stepped
back
affecting
a
more
distant
scrutiny
and
as
i
did
so
my
eye
caught
fontage
s
profile
her
lids
trembled
slightly
i
took
refuge
in
the
familiar
expedient
of
asking
the
history
of
the
picture
and
she
waved
me
brightly
to
a
seat
this
was
indeed
a
topic
on
which
she
could
dilate
the
rembrandt
it
appeared
had
come
into
fontage
s
possession
many
years
ago
while
the
young
couple
were
on
their
and
under
circumstances
so
romantic
that
she
made
no
excuse
for
relating
them
in
all
their
parenthetic
fulness
the
picture
belonged
to
an
old
belgian
countess
of
redundant
quarterings
whom
the
extravagances
of
an
ungovernable
nephew
had
compelled
to
part
with
her
possessions
in
the
most
private
manner
about
the
time
of
the
fontages
arrival
by
a
really
remarkable
coincidence
it
happened
that
their
courier
an
exceptionally
intelligent
and
superior
man
was
an
old
servant
of
the
countess
s
and
had
thus
been
able
to
put
them
in
the
way
of
securing
the
rembrandt
under
the
very
nose
of
an
english
duke
whose
agent
had
been
sent
to
brussels
to
negotiate
for
its
purchase
fontage
could
not
recall
the
duke
s
name
but
he
was
a
great
collector
and
had
a
famous
highland
castle
where
somebody
had
been
murdered
and
which
she
herself
had
visited
by
moonlight
when
she
had
travelled
in
scotland
as
a
girl
the
episode
had
in
short
been
one
of
the
most
interesting
experiences
of
a
tour
almost
in
vivacity
of
impression
and
they
had
always
meant
to
go
back
to
brussels
for
the
sake
of
reliving
so
picturesque
a
moment
circumstances
of
which
the
narrator
s
surroundings
declared
the
nature
had
persistently
interfered
with
the
projected
return
to
europe
and
the
picture
had
grown
doubly
valuable
as
representing
the
mark
of
their
artistic
emotions
fontage
s
moist
eye
caressed
the
canvas
there
is
only
she
added
with
a
perceptible
effort
one
slight
drawback
the
picture
is
not
signed
but
for
that
the
countess
of
course
would
have
sold
it
to
a
museum
all
the
connoisseurs
who
have
seen
it
pronounce
it
an
undoubted
rembrandt
in
the
artist
s
best
manner
but
the
museums
she
arched
her
brows
in
smiling
recognition
of
a
weakness
give
the
preference
to
signed
examples
fontage
s
words
evoked
so
touching
a
vision
of
the
young
tourists
of
fifty
years
ago
entrusting
to
an
accomplished
and
versatile
courier
the
direction
of
their
helpless
zeal
for
art
that
i
lost
sight
for
a
moment
of
the
point
at
issue
the
old
belgian
countess
the
wealthy
duke
with
a
feudal
castle
in
scotland
fontage
s
own
maiden
pilgrimage
to
arthur
s
seat
and
holyrood
all
the
accessories
of
the
naïf
transaction
seemed
a
part
of
that
vanished
europe
to
which
our
young
race
carried
its
indiscriminate
ardors
its
tender
romantic
credulity
the
legendary
castellated
europe
of
keepsakes
brigands
and
old
masters
that
compensated
by
one
such
experience
as
fontage
s
for
an
of
aesthetic
privation
i
was
restored
to
the
present
by
eleanor
s
looking
at
her
watch
the
action
mutely
conveyed
that
something
was
expected
of
me
i
risked
the
temporizing
statement
that
the
picture
was
very
interesting
but
fontage
s
polite
assent
revealed
the
poverty
of
the
expedient
eleanor
s
impatience
overflowed
you
would
like
my
cousin
to
give
you
an
idea
of
its
value
she
suggested
fontage
grew
more
erect
no
one
she
corrected
with
great
gentleness
can
know
its
value
quite
as
well
as
i
who
live
with
it
we
murmured
our
hasty
concurrence
but
it
might
be
interesting
to
hear
she
addressed
herself
to
me
as
a
mere
matter
of
curiosity
what
estimate
would
be
put
on
it
from
the
purely
commercial
point
of
view
if
such
a
term
may
be
used
in
speaking
of
a
work
of
i
sounded
a
note
of
deprecation
oh
i
understand
of
course
she
delicately
anticipated
me
that
that
could
never
be
view
your
personal
view
but
since
occasions
arise
do
arise
when
it
becomes
necessary
to
to
put
a
price
on
the
priceless
as
it
were
i
have
thought
miss
copt
has
suggested
some
day
eleanor
encouraged
her
you
might
feel
that
the
picture
ought
to
belong
to
some
one
who
has
more
more
opportunity
of
showing
it
letting
it
be
seen
by
the
public
for
educational
reasons
i
have
tried
fontage
admitted
to
see
it
in
that
the
crucial
moment
was
upon
me
to
escape
the
challenge
of
fontage
s
brilliant
composure
i
turned
once
more
to
the
picture
if
my
courage
needed
reinforcement
the
picture
amply
furnished
it
looking
at
that
lamentable
canvas
seemed
the
surest
way
of
gathering
strength
to
denounce
it
but
behind
me
all
the
while
i
felt
fontage
s
shuddering
pride
drawn
up
in
a
final
effort
of
i
hated
myself
for
my
sentimental
perversion
of
the
situation
reason
argued
that
it
was
more
cruel
to
deceive
fontage
than
to
tell
her
the
truth
but
that
merely
proved
the
inferiority
of
reason
to
instinct
in
situations
involving
any
concession
to
the
emotions
along
with
her
faith
in
the
rembrandt
i
must
destroy
not
only
the
whole
fabric
of
fontage
s
past
but
even
that
lifelong
habit
of
acquiescence
in
untested
formulas
that
makes
the
best
part
of
the
average
feminine
strength
i
guessed
the
episode
of
the
picture
to
be
inextricably
interwoven
with
the
traditions
and
convictions
which
served
to
veil
fontage
s
destitution
not
only
from
others
but
from
herself
viewed
in
that
light
the
rembrandt
had
perhaps
been
worth
its
and
i
regretted
that
works
of
art
do
not
commonly
sell
on
the
merit
of
the
moral
support
they
may
have
rendered
from
this
unavailing
flight
i
was
recalled
by
the
sense
that
something
must
be
done
to
place
a
fictitious
value
on
the
picture
was
at
best
a
provisional
measure
while
the
brutal
alternative
of
advising
fontage
to
sell
it
for
a
hundred
dollars
at
least
afforded
an
opening
to
the
charitably
disposed
purchaser
i
intended
if
other
resources
failed
to
put
myself
forward
in
that
light
but
delicacy
of
course
forbade
my
coupling
my
unflattering
estimate
of
the
rembrandt
with
an
immediate
offer
to
buy
it
all
i
could
do
was
to
inflict
the
wound
the
healing
unguent
must
be
withheld
for
later
application
i
turned
to
fontage
who
sat
motionless
her
cheeks
touched
with
an
expectant
color
her
eyes
averted
from
the
picture
which
was
so
evidently
the
one
object
they
beheld
my
dear
madam
i
began
her
vivid
smile
was
like
a
light
held
up
to
dazzle
me
it
shrouded
every
alternative
in
darkness
and
i
had
the
flurried
sense
of
having
lost
my
way
among
the
intricacies
of
my
contention
of
a
sudden
i
felt
the
hopelessness
of
finding
a
crack
in
her
impenetrable
conviction
my
words
slipped
from
me
like
broken
weapons
the
picture
i
faltered
would
of
course
be
worth
more
if
it
were
signed
as
it
is
i
i
hardly
think
on
a
conservative
estimate
it
can
be
valued
at
at
more
than
a
thousand
dollars
say
my
deflected
argument
ran
on
somewhat
aimlessly
till
it
found
itself
plunging
full
tilt
against
the
barrier
of
fontage
s
silence
she
sat
as
impassive
as
though
i
had
not
spoken
eleanor
loosed
a
few
fluttering
words
of
congratulation
and
encouragement
but
their
flight
was
suddenly
cut
short
fontage
had
risen
with
a
certain
solemnity
i
could
never
she
said
gently
her
gentleness
was
adamantine
under
any
circumstances
whatever
consider
for
a
moment
even
the
possibility
of
parting
with
the
picture
at
such
a
ii
within
three
weeks
a
tremulous
note
from
fontage
requested
the
favor
of
another
visit
if
the
writing
was
tremulous
however
the
writer
s
tone
was
firm
she
named
her
own
day
and
hour
without
the
conventional
reference
to
her
visitor
s
convenience
my
first
impulse
was
to
turn
the
note
over
to
eleanor
i
had
acquitted
myself
of
my
share
in
the
ungrateful
business
of
coming
to
fontage
s
aid
and
if
as
her
letter
denoted
she
had
now
yielded
to
the
closer
pressure
of
need
the
business
of
finding
a
purchaser
for
the
rembrandt
might
well
be
left
to
my
cousin
s
ingenuity
but
here
conscience
put
in
the
uncomfortable
reminder
that
it
was
i
who
in
putting
a
price
on
the
picture
had
raised
the
real
obstacle
in
the
way
of
fontage
s
rescue
no
one
would
give
a
thousand
dollars
for
the
rembrandt
but
to
tell
fontage
so
had
become
as
unthinkable
as
murder
i
had
in
fact
on
returning
from
my
first
inspection
of
the
picture
refrained
from
imparting
to
eleanor
my
opinion
of
its
value
eleanor
is
porous
and
i
knew
that
sooner
or
later
the
unnecessary
truth
would
exude
through
the
loose
texture
of
her
dissimulation
not
infrequently
she
thus
creates
the
misery
she
alleviates
and
i
have
sometimes
suspected
her
of
paining
people
in
order
that
she
might
be
sorry
for
them
i
had
at
all
events
cut
off
retreat
in
eleanor
s
direction
and
the
remaining
alternative
carried
me
straight
to
fontage
she
received
me
with
the
same
commanding
sweetness
the
room
was
even
barer
than
before
i
believe
the
carpet
was
gone
but
her
manner
built
up
about
her
a
palace
to
which
i
was
welcomed
with
high
state
and
it
was
as
a
mere
incident
of
the
ceremony
that
i
was
presently
made
aware
of
her
decision
to
sell
the
rembrandt
my
previous
unsuccess
in
planning
how
to
deal
with
fontage
had
warned
me
to
leave
my
farther
course
to
chance
and
i
listened
to
her
explanation
with
complete
detachment
she
had
resolved
to
travel
for
her
health
her
doctor
advised
it
and
as
her
absence
might
be
indefinitely
prolonged
she
had
reluctantly
decided
to
part
with
the
picture
in
order
to
avoid
the
expense
of
storage
and
insurance
her
voice
drooped
at
the
admission
and
she
hurried
on
detailing
the
vague
itinerary
of
a
journey
that
was
to
combine
visits
to
impatient
friends
with
various
interesting
opportunities
less
definitely
specified
the
poor
lady
s
skill
in
rearing
a
screen
of
verbiage
about
her
enforced
avowal
had
distracted
me
from
my
own
share
in
the
situation
and
it
was
with
dismay
that
i
suddenly
caught
the
drift
of
her
assumptions
she
expected
me
to
buy
the
rembrandt
for
the
museum
she
had
taken
my
previous
valuation
as
a
tentative
bid
and
when
i
came
to
my
senses
she
was
in
the
act
of
accepting
my
offer
had
i
had
a
thousand
dollars
of
my
own
to
dispose
of
the
bargain
would
have
been
concluded
on
the
spot
but
i
was
in
the
impossible
position
of
being
materially
unable
to
buy
the
picture
and
morally
unable
to
tell
her
that
it
was
not
worth
acquiring
for
the
museum
i
dashed
into
the
first
evasion
in
sight
i
had
no
authority
i
explained
to
purchase
pictures
for
the
museum
without
the
consent
of
the
committee
fontage
coped
for
a
moment
in
silence
with
the
incredible
fact
that
i
had
rejected
her
offer
then
she
ventured
with
a
kind
of
pale
precipitation
but
i
understood
miss
copt
tells
me
that
you
practically
decide
such
matters
for
the
i
could
guess
what
the
effort
had
cost
her
my
cousin
is
given
to
generalizations
my
opinion
may
have
some
weight
with
the
committee
well
then
she
timidly
prompted
for
that
very
reason
i
can
t
buy
the
she
said
with
a
drooping
note
i
don
t
yet
you
told
me
i
reminded
her
that
you
knew
museums
didn
t
buy
unsigned
not
for
what
they
are
worth
every
one
knows
that
but
i
i
understood
the
price
you
named
her
pride
shuddered
back
from
the
abasement
it
s
a
misunderstanding
then
she
faltered
to
avoid
looking
at
her
i
glanced
desperately
at
the
rembrandt
could
i
but
reason
rejected
the
possibility
even
if
the
committee
had
been
blind
and
they
all
but
crozier
i
simply
shouldn
t
have
dared
to
do
it
i
stood
up
feeling
that
to
cut
the
matter
short
was
the
only
alleviation
within
reach
fontage
had
summoned
her
indomitable
smile
but
its
brilliancy
dropped
as
i
opened
the
door
like
a
candle
blown
out
by
a
draught
if
there
s
any
one
else
if
you
knew
any
one
who
would
care
to
see
the
picture
i
should
be
most
happy
she
kept
her
eyes
on
me
and
i
saw
that
in
her
case
it
hurt
less
than
to
look
at
the
rembrandt
i
shall
have
to
leave
here
you
know
she
panted
if
nobody
cares
to
have
it
iii
that
evening
at
my
club
i
had
just
succeeded
in
losing
sight
of
fontage
in
the
fumes
of
an
excellent
cigar
when
a
voice
at
my
elbow
evoked
her
harassing
image
i
want
to
talk
to
you
the
speaker
said
about
fontage
s
there
isn
t
any
i
was
about
to
growl
but
looking
up
i
recognized
the
confiding
countenance
of
jefferson
rose
rose
was
known
to
me
chiefly
as
a
young
man
suffused
with
a
vague
enthusiasm
for
virtue
and
my
cousin
eleanor
one
glance
at
his
glossy
exterior
conveyed
the
assurance
that
his
morals
were
as
immaculate
as
his
complexion
and
his
linen
goodness
exuded
from
his
moist
eye
his
liquid
voice
the
warm
damp
pressure
of
his
trustful
hand
he
had
always
struck
me
as
one
of
the
most
uncomplicated
organisms
i
had
ever
met
his
ideas
were
as
simple
and
inconsecutive
as
the
propositions
in
a
primer
and
he
spoke
slowly
with
a
kind
of
uniformity
of
emphasis
that
made
his
words
stand
out
like
the
raised
type
for
the
blind
an
obvious
incapacity
for
abstract
conceptions
made
him
peculiarly
susceptible
to
the
magic
of
generalization
and
one
felt
he
would
have
been
at
the
mercy
of
any
cause
that
spelled
itself
with
a
capital
letter
it
was
hard
to
explain
how
with
such
a
superabundance
of
merit
he
managed
to
be
a
good
fellow
i
can
only
say
that
he
performed
the
astonishing
feat
as
naturally
as
he
supported
an
invalid
mother
and
two
sisters
on
the
slender
salary
of
a
banker
s
clerk
he
sat
down
beside
me
with
an
air
of
bright
expectancy
it
s
a
remarkable
picture
isn
t
it
he
said
you
ve
seen
it
i
ve
been
so
fortunate
miss
copt
was
kind
enough
to
get
fontage
s
permission
we
went
this
i
inwardly
wished
that
eleanor
had
selected
another
victim
unless
indeed
the
visit
were
part
of
a
plan
whereby
some
third
person
better
equipped
for
the
cultivation
of
delusions
was
to
be
made
to
think
the
rembrandt
remarkable
knowing
the
limitations
of
rose
s
resources
i
began
to
wonder
if
he
had
any
rich
aunts
and
her
buying
it
in
that
way
too
he
went
on
with
his
limpid
smile
from
that
old
countess
in
brussels
makes
it
all
the
more
interesting
doesn
t
it
miss
copt
tells
me
it
s
very
seldom
old
pictures
can
be
traced
back
for
more
than
a
generation
i
suppose
the
fact
of
fontage
s
knowing
its
history
must
add
a
good
deal
to
its
value
uncertain
as
to
his
drift
i
said
in
her
eyes
it
certainly
appears
implications
are
lost
on
rose
who
glowingly
continued
that
s
the
reason
why
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
about
it
to
consult
you
miss
copt
tells
me
you
value
it
at
a
thousand
there
was
no
denying
this
and
i
grunted
a
reluctant
assent
of
course
he
went
on
earnestly
your
valuation
is
based
on
the
fact
that
the
picture
isn
t
signed
fontage
explained
that
and
it
does
make
a
difference
certainly
but
the
thing
is
if
the
picture
s
really
good
ought
one
to
take
advantage
i
mean
one
can
see
that
fontage
is
in
a
tight
place
and
i
wouldn
t
for
the
world
my
astonished
stare
arrested
him
wouldn
t
i
mean
you
see
it
s
just
this
way
he
coughed
and
blushed
i
can
t
give
more
than
a
thousand
dollars
myself
it
s
as
big
a
sum
as
i
can
manage
to
scrape
together
but
before
i
make
the
offer
i
want
to
be
sure
i
m
not
standing
in
the
way
of
her
getting
more
my
astonishment
lapsed
to
dismay
you
re
going
to
buy
the
picture
for
a
thousand
dollars
his
blush
deepened
why
yes
it
sounds
rather
absurd
i
suppose
it
isn
t
much
in
my
line
of
course
i
can
see
the
picture
s
very
beautiful
but
i
m
no
judge
it
isn
t
the
kind
of
thing
naturally
that
i
could
afford
to
go
in
for
but
in
this
case
i
m
very
glad
to
do
what
i
can
the
circumstances
are
so
distressing
and
knowing
what
you
think
of
the
picture
i
feel
it
s
a
pretty
safe
investment
i
don
t
think
i
blurted
out
you
i
don
t
think
the
picture
s
worth
a
thousand
dollars
i
don
t
think
it
s
worth
ten
cents
i
simply
lied
about
it
that
s
rose
looked
as
frightened
as
though
i
had
charged
him
with
the
offense
hang
it
man
can
t
you
see
how
it
happened
i
saw
the
poor
woman
s
pride
and
happiness
hung
on
her
faith
in
that
picture
i
tried
to
make
her
understand
that
it
was
worthless
but
she
wouldn
t
i
tried
to
tell
her
so
but
i
couldn
t
i
behaved
like
a
maudlin
ass
but
you
shan
t
pay
for
my
infernal
bungling
you
mustn
t
buy
the
picture
rose
sat
silent
tapping
one
glossy
with
another
suddenly
he
turned
on
me
a
glance
of
stored
intelligence
but
you
know
he
said
i
rather
think
i
you
haven
t
already
oh
no
the
offer
s
not
well
then
his
look
gathered
a
brighter
significance
but
if
the
picture
s
worth
nothing
nobody
will
buy
it
i
groaned
except
he
continued
some
fellow
like
me
who
doesn
t
know
anything
think
it
s
lovely
you
know
i
mean
to
hang
it
in
my
mother
s
he
rose
and
clasped
my
hand
in
his
adhesive
pressure
i
m
awfully
obliged
to
you
for
telling
me
this
but
perhaps
you
won
t
mind
my
asking
you
not
to
mention
our
talk
to
miss
copt
it
might
bother
her
you
know
to
think
the
picture
isn
t
exactly
up
to
the
mark
and
it
won
t
make
a
rap
of
difference
to
iv
rose
left
me
to
a
sleepless
night
the
next
morning
my
resolve
was
formed
and
it
carried
me
straight
to
fontage
s
she
answered
my
knock
by
stepping
out
on
the
landing
and
as
she
shut
the
door
behind
her
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
devastated
interior
she
mentioned
with
a
careful
avoidance
of
the
note
of
pathos
on
which
our
last
conversation
had
closed
that
she
was
preparing
to
leave
that
afternoon
and
the
trunks
obstructing
the
threshold
showed
that
her
preparations
were
nearly
complete
they
were
i
felt
certain
the
same
trunks
that
strapped
behind
a
rattling
vettura
had
accompanied
the
bride
and
groom
on
that
memorable
voyage
of
discovery
of
which
the
booty
had
till
recently
adorned
her
walls
and
there
was
a
dim
consolation
in
the
thought
that
those
early
finds
in
coral
and
swiss
in
lava
and
alabaster
still
lay
behind
the
worn
locks
in
the
security
of
worthlessness
fontage
on
the
landing
among
her
strapped
and
corded
treasures
maintained
the
same
air
of
stability
that
made
it
impossible
even
under
such
conditions
to
regard
her
flight
as
anything
less
dignified
than
a
departure
it
was
the
moral
support
of
what
she
tacitly
assumed
that
enabled
me
to
set
forth
with
proper
deliberation
the
object
of
my
visit
and
she
received
my
announcement
with
an
absence
of
surprise
that
struck
me
as
the
very
flower
of
tact
under
cover
of
these
mutual
assumptions
the
transaction
was
rapidly
concluded
and
it
was
not
till
the
canvas
passed
into
my
hands
that
as
though
the
physical
contact
had
unnerved
her
fontage
suddenly
faltered
it
s
the
giving
it
up
she
stammered
disguising
herself
to
the
last
and
i
hastened
away
from
the
collapse
of
her
splendid
effrontery
i
need
hardly
point
out
that
i
had
acted
impulsively
and
that
reaction
from
the
most
honorable
impulses
is
sometimes
attended
by
moral
perturbation
my
motives
had
indeed
been
mixed
enough
to
justify
some
uneasiness
but
this
was
allayed
by
the
instinctive
feeling
that
it
is
more
venial
to
defraud
an
institution
than
a
man
since
fontage
had
to
be
kept
from
starving
by
means
not
wholly
defensible
it
was
better
that
the
obligation
should
be
borne
by
a
rich
institution
than
an
impecunious
youth
i
doubt
in
fact
if
my
scruples
would
have
survived
a
night
s
sleep
had
they
not
been
complicated
by
some
uncertainty
as
to
my
own
future
it
was
true
that
subject
to
the
purely
formal
assent
of
the
committee
i
had
full
power
to
buy
for
the
museum
and
that
the
one
member
of
the
committee
likely
to
dispute
my
decision
was
opportunely
travelling
in
europe
but
the
picture
once
in
place
i
must
face
the
risk
of
any
expert
criticism
to
which
chance
might
expose
it
i
dismissed
this
contingency
for
future
study
stored
the
rembrandt
in
the
cellar
of
the
museum
and
thanked
heaven
that
crozier
was
abroad
six
months
later
he
strolled
into
my
office
i
had
just
concluded
under
conditions
of
exceptional
difficulty
and
on
terms
unexpectedly
benign
the
purchase
of
the
great
bartley
reynolds
and
this
circumstance
by
relegating
the
matter
of
the
rembrandt
to
a
lower
stratum
of
consciousness
enabled
me
to
welcome
crozier
with
unmixed
pleasure
my
security
was
enhanced
by
his
appearance
his
smile
was
charged
with
amiable
reminiscences
and
i
inferred
that
his
trip
had
put
him
in
the
humor
to
approve
of
everything
or
at
least
to
ignore
what
fell
short
of
his
approval
i
had
therefore
no
uneasiness
in
accepting
his
invitation
to
dine
that
evening
it
is
always
pleasant
to
dine
with
crozier
and
never
more
so
than
when
he
is
just
back
from
europe
his
conversation
gives
even
the
food
a
flavor
of
the
café
anglais
the
repast
was
delightful
and
it
was
not
till
we
had
finished
a
camembert
which
he
must
have
brought
over
with
him
that
my
host
said
in
a
tone
of
perfunctoriness
i
see
you
ve
picked
up
a
picture
or
two
since
i
i
assented
the
bartley
reynolds
seemed
too
good
an
opportunity
to
miss
especially
as
the
french
government
was
after
it
i
think
we
got
it
cheap
said
crozier
pleasantly
i
know
all
about
the
reynolds
it
was
the
biggest
kind
of
a
haul
and
i
congratulate
you
best
stroke
of
business
we
ve
done
yet
but
tell
me
about
the
other
picture
the
i
never
said
it
was
a
i
could
hardly
have
said
why
but
i
felt
distinctly
annoyed
with
crozier
of
course
not
there
s
rembrandt
on
the
frame
but
i
saw
you
d
modified
it
to
dutch
school
i
he
paused
but
i
offered
no
explanation
what
about
it
he
went
on
where
did
you
pick
it
up
as
he
leaned
to
the
flame
of
the
his
face
seemed
ruddy
with
enjoyment
i
got
it
for
a
song
i
said
a
thousand
i
think
have
you
seen
it
i
asked
abruptly
went
over
the
place
this
afternoon
and
found
it
in
the
cellar
why
hasn
t
it
been
hung
by
the
way
i
paused
a
moment
i
m
waiting
to
to
have
it
ah
he
leaned
back
and
poured
himself
a
second
glass
of
chartreuse
the
smile
he
confided
to
its
golden
depths
provoked
me
to
challenge
him
with
what
do
you
think
of
it
the
rembrandt
he
lifted
his
eyes
from
the
glass
just
what
you
it
isn
t
a
i
apologize
again
you
call
it
i
believe
a
picture
of
the
same
period
i
m
uncertain
of
the
h
he
glanced
appreciatively
along
his
cigar
what
are
you
certain
of
that
it
s
a
damned
bad
picture
i
said
savagely
he
nodded
just
so
that
s
all
we
wanted
to
we
i
the
committee
in
short
you
see
my
dear
fellow
if
you
hadn
t
been
certain
it
was
a
damned
bad
picture
our
position
would
have
been
a
little
awkward
as
it
is
my
remaining
duty
i
ought
to
explain
that
in
this
matter
i
m
acting
for
the
committee
is
as
simple
as
it
s
i
ll
be
hanged
i
burst
out
if
i
understand
one
word
you
re
saying
he
fixed
me
with
a
kind
of
cruel
joyousness
you
will
you
will
he
assured
me
at
least
you
ll
begin
to
when
you
hear
that
i
ve
seen
miss
miss
copt
and
that
she
has
told
me
under
what
conditions
the
picture
was
she
doesn
t
know
anything
about
the
conditions
that
is
i
added
hastening
to
restrict
the
assertion
she
doesn
t
know
my
opinion
of
the
i
thirsted
for
five
minutes
with
eleanor
are
you
quite
sure
crozier
took
me
up
mr
jefferson
rose
ah
i
i
thought
you
would
he
reminded
me
as
soon
as
i
d
laid
eyes
on
the
rembrandt
i
beg
your
pardon
i
saw
that
it
well
required
some
you
might
have
come
to
i
meant
to
but
i
happened
to
meet
miss
copt
whose
encyclopædic
information
has
often
before
been
of
service
to
me
i
always
go
to
miss
copt
when
i
want
to
look
up
anything
and
i
found
she
knew
all
about
the
precisely
the
knowledge
was
in
fact
causing
her
sleepless
nights
rose
who
was
suffering
from
the
same
form
of
insomnia
had
taken
her
into
his
confidence
and
she
ultimately
took
me
into
of
course
i
must
ask
you
to
do
your
cousin
justice
she
didn
t
speak
till
it
became
evident
to
her
uncommonly
quick
perceptions
that
your
buying
the
picture
on
its
merits
would
have
been
infinitely
worse
for
for
everybody
than
your
diverting
a
small
portion
of
the
museum
s
funds
to
philanthropic
uses
then
she
told
me
the
moving
incident
of
rose
good
fellow
rose
and
the
old
lady
s
case
was
desperate
somebody
had
to
buy
that
i
moved
uneasily
in
my
seat
wait
a
moment
will
you
i
haven
t
finished
my
cigar
there
s
a
little
head
of
il
fiammingo
s
that
you
haven
t
seen
by
the
way
i
picked
it
up
the
other
day
in
parma
we
ll
go
in
and
have
a
look
at
it
presently
but
meanwhile
what
i
want
to
say
is
that
i
ve
been
charged
in
the
most
informal
way
to
express
to
you
the
committee
s
appreciation
of
your
admirable
promptness
and
energy
in
capturing
the
bartley
reynolds
we
shouldn
t
have
got
it
at
all
if
you
hadn
t
been
uncommonly
and
to
get
it
at
such
a
price
is
a
double
triumph
we
d
have
thought
nothing
of
a
few
more
thousands
i
don
t
see
i
impatiently
interposed
that
as
far
as
i
m
concerned
that
alters
the
the
case
of
fontage
s
rembrandt
i
bought
the
picture
because
as
you
say
the
situation
was
desperate
and
i
couldn
t
raise
a
thousand
myself
what
i
did
was
of
course
indefensible
but
the
money
shall
be
refunded
tomorrow
crozier
raised
a
protesting
hand
don
t
interrupt
me
when
i
m
talking
ex
cathedra
the
money
s
been
refunded
already
the
fact
is
the
museum
has
sold
the
i
stared
at
him
wildly
sold
it
to
whom
why
to
the
hold
on
a
bit
won
t
you
take
another
cigar
then
perhaps
i
can
finish
what
i
ve
got
to
why
my
dear
fellow
the
committee
s
under
an
obligation
to
you
that
s
the
way
we
look
at
it
i
ve
investigated
fontage
s
case
and
well
the
picture
had
to
be
bought
she
s
eating
meat
now
i
believe
for
the
first
time
in
a
year
and
they
d
have
turned
her
out
into
the
street
that
very
day
your
cousin
tells
me
something
had
to
be
done
at
once
and
you
ve
simply
given
a
number
of
and
gentlemen
the
opportunity
of
performing
at
very
small
individual
expense
a
meritorious
action
in
the
nick
of
time
that
s
the
first
thing
i
ve
got
to
thank
you
for
and
then
you
ll
remember
please
that
i
have
the
floor
that
i
m
still
speaking
for
the
committee
and
secondly
as
a
slight
recognition
of
your
services
in
securing
the
bartley
reynolds
at
a
very
much
lower
figure
than
we
were
prepared
to
pay
we
beg
you
the
committee
begs
you
to
accept
the
gift
of
fontage
s
rembrandt
now
we
ll
go
in
and
look
at
that
little
head
the
moving
finger
the
news
of
grancy
s
death
came
to
me
with
the
shock
of
an
immense
blunder
one
of
fate
s
most
irretrievable
acts
of
vandalism
it
was
as
though
all
sorts
of
renovating
forces
had
been
checked
by
the
clogging
of
that
one
wheel
not
that
grancy
contributed
any
perceptible
momentum
to
the
social
machine
her
unique
distinction
was
that
of
filling
to
perfection
her
special
place
in
the
world
so
many
people
are
like
statues
their
niches
at
one
point
and
leaving
them
vacant
at
another
grancy
s
niche
was
her
husband
s
life
and
if
it
be
argued
that
the
space
was
not
large
enough
for
its
vacancy
to
leave
a
very
big
gap
i
can
only
say
that
at
the
last
resort
such
dimensions
must
be
determined
by
finer
instruments
than
any
standard
of
utility
ralph
grancy
s
was
in
short
a
kind
of
disembodied
usefulness
one
of
those
constructive
influences
that
instead
of
crystallizing
into
definite
forms
remain
as
it
were
a
medium
for
the
development
of
clear
thinking
and
fine
feeling
he
faithfully
irrigated
his
own
dusty
patch
of
life
and
the
fruitful
moisture
stole
far
beyond
his
boundaries
if
to
carry
on
the
metaphor
grancy
s
life
was
a
enclosure
his
wife
was
the
flower
he
had
planted
in
its
midst
the
embowering
tree
rather
which
gave
him
rest
and
shade
at
its
foot
and
the
wind
of
dreams
in
its
upper
branches
we
had
all
his
small
but
devoted
band
of
followers
known
a
moment
when
it
seemed
likely
that
grancy
would
fail
us
we
had
watched
him
pitted
against
one
stupid
obstacle
after
another
poverty
misunderstanding
and
worst
of
all
for
a
man
of
his
texture
his
first
wife
s
soft
insidious
egotism
we
had
seen
him
sinking
under
the
leaden
embrace
of
her
affection
like
a
swimmer
in
a
drowning
clutch
but
just
as
we
despaired
he
had
always
come
to
the
surface
again
blinded
panting
but
striking
out
fiercely
for
the
shore
when
at
last
her
death
released
him
it
became
a
question
as
to
how
much
of
the
man
she
had
carried
with
her
left
alone
he
revealed
numb
withered
patches
like
a
tree
from
which
a
parasite
has
been
stripped
but
gradually
he
began
to
put
out
new
leaves
and
when
he
met
the
lady
who
was
to
become
his
second
wife
his
one
wife
as
his
friends
reckoned
the
whole
man
burst
into
flower
the
second
grancy
was
past
thirty
when
he
married
her
and
it
was
clear
that
she
had
harvested
that
crop
of
middle
joy
which
is
rooted
in
young
despair
but
if
she
had
lost
the
surface
of
eighteen
she
had
kept
its
inner
light
if
her
cheek
lacked
the
gloss
of
immaturity
her
eyes
were
young
with
the
stored
youth
of
half
a
grancy
had
first
known
her
somewhere
in
the
east
i
believe
she
was
the
sister
of
one
of
our
consuls
out
there
and
when
he
brought
her
home
to
new
york
she
came
among
us
as
a
stranger
the
idea
of
grancy
s
remarriage
had
been
a
shock
to
us
all
after
one
such
calcining
most
men
would
have
kept
out
of
the
fire
but
we
agreed
that
he
was
predestined
to
sentimental
blunders
and
we
awaited
with
resignation
the
embodiment
of
his
latest
mistake
then
grancy
came
and
we
understood
she
was
the
most
beautiful
and
the
most
complete
of
explanations
we
shuffled
our
defeated
omniscience
out
of
sight
and
gave
it
hasty
burial
under
a
prodigality
of
welcome
for
the
first
time
in
years
we
had
grancy
off
our
minds
he
ll
do
something
great
now
the
least
sanguine
of
us
prophesied
and
our
sentimentalist
emended
he
done
it
in
marrying
her
it
was
claydon
the
who
risked
this
hyperbole
and
who
soon
afterward
at
the
happy
husband
s
request
prepared
to
defend
it
in
a
portrait
of
grancy
we
were
all
even
claydon
ready
to
concede
that
grancy
s
unwontedness
was
in
some
degree
a
matter
of
environment
her
graces
were
complementary
and
it
needed
the
mate
s
call
to
reveal
the
flash
of
color
beneath
her
wings
but
if
she
needed
grancy
to
interpret
her
how
much
greater
was
the
service
she
rendered
him
claydon
professionally
described
her
as
the
right
frame
for
him
but
if
she
defined
she
also
enlarged
if
she
threw
the
whole
into
perspective
she
also
cleared
new
ground
opened
fresh
vistas
reclaimed
whole
areas
of
activity
that
had
run
to
waste
under
the
harsh
husbandry
of
privation
this
interaction
of
sympathies
was
not
without
its
visible
expression
claydon
was
not
alone
in
maintaining
that
grancy
s
presence
or
indeed
the
mere
mention
of
his
name
had
a
perceptible
effect
on
his
wife
s
appearance
it
was
as
though
a
light
were
shifted
a
curtain
drawn
back
as
though
to
borrow
another
of
claydon
s
metaphors
love
the
indefatigable
artist
were
perpetually
seeking
a
happier
pose
for
his
model
in
this
interpretative
light
grancy
acquired
the
charm
which
makes
some
women
s
faces
like
a
book
of
which
the
last
page
is
never
turned
there
was
always
something
new
to
read
in
her
eyes
what
claydon
read
there
or
at
least
such
scattered
hints
of
the
ritual
as
reached
him
through
the
sanctuary
doors
his
portrait
in
due
course
declared
to
us
when
the
picture
was
exhibited
it
was
at
once
acclaimed
as
his
masterpiece
but
the
people
who
knew
grancy
smiled
and
said
it
was
flattered
claydon
however
had
not
set
out
to
paint
grancy
or
ours
even
but
ralph
s
and
ralph
knew
his
own
at
a
glance
at
the
first
confrontation
he
saw
that
claydon
had
understood
as
for
grancy
when
the
finished
picture
was
shown
to
her
she
turned
to
the
painter
and
said
simply
ah
you
ve
done
me
facing
the
east
the
picture
then
for
all
its
value
seemed
a
mere
incident
in
the
unfolding
of
their
double
destiny
a
to
the
illuminated
text
of
their
lives
it
was
not
till
afterward
that
it
acquired
the
significance
of
last
words
spoken
on
a
threshold
never
to
be
recrossed
grancy
a
year
after
his
marriage
had
given
up
his
town
house
and
carried
his
bliss
an
hour
s
journey
away
to
a
little
place
among
the
hills
his
various
duties
and
interests
brought
him
frequently
to
new
york
but
we
necessarily
saw
him
less
often
than
when
his
house
had
served
as
the
of
kindred
enthusiasms
it
seemed
a
pity
that
such
an
influence
should
be
withdrawn
but
we
all
felt
that
his
long
arrears
of
happiness
should
be
paid
in
whatever
coin
he
chose
the
distance
from
which
the
fortunate
couple
radiated
warmth
on
us
was
not
too
great
for
friendship
to
traverse
and
our
conception
of
a
glorified
leisure
took
the
form
of
sundays
spent
in
the
grancys
library
with
its
sedative
rural
outlook
and
the
portrait
of
grancy
illuminating
its
studious
walls
the
picture
was
at
its
best
in
that
setting
and
we
used
to
accuse
claydon
of
visiting
grancy
in
order
to
see
her
portrait
he
met
this
by
declaring
that
the
portrait
grancy
and
there
were
moments
when
the
statement
seemed
unanswerable
one
of
us
indeed
i
think
it
must
have
been
the
novelist
said
that
clayton
had
been
saved
from
falling
in
love
with
grancy
only
by
falling
in
love
with
his
picture
of
her
and
it
was
noticeable
that
he
to
whom
his
finished
work
was
no
more
than
the
shed
husk
of
future
effort
showed
a
perennial
tenderness
for
this
one
achievement
we
smiled
afterward
to
think
how
often
when
grancy
was
in
the
room
her
presence
reflecting
itself
in
our
talk
like
a
gleam
of
sky
in
a
hurrying
current
claydon
averted
from
the
real
woman
would
sit
as
it
were
listening
to
the
picture
his
attitude
at
the
time
seemed
only
a
part
of
the
unusualness
of
those
picturesque
afternoons
when
the
most
familiar
combinations
of
life
underwent
a
magical
change
some
human
happiness
is
a
landlocked
lake
but
the
grancys
was
an
open
sea
stretching
a
buoyant
and
illimitable
surface
to
the
voyaging
interests
of
life
there
was
room
and
to
spare
on
those
waters
for
all
our
separate
ventures
and
always
beyond
the
sunset
a
mirage
of
the
fortunate
isles
toward
which
our
prows
bent
ii
it
was
in
rome
that
three
years
later
i
heard
of
her
death
the
notice
said
suddenly
i
was
glad
of
that
i
was
glad
too
basely
perhaps
to
be
away
from
grancy
at
a
time
when
silence
must
have
seemed
obtuse
and
speech
derisive
i
was
still
in
rome
when
a
few
months
afterward
he
suddenly
arrived
there
he
had
been
appointed
secretary
of
legation
at
constantinople
and
was
on
the
way
to
his
post
he
had
taken
the
place
he
said
frankly
to
get
our
relations
with
the
porte
held
out
a
prospect
of
hard
work
and
that
he
explained
was
what
he
needed
he
could
never
be
satisfied
to
sit
down
among
the
ruins
i
saw
that
like
most
of
us
in
moments
of
extreme
moral
tension
he
was
playing
a
part
behaving
as
he
thought
it
became
a
man
to
behave
in
the
eye
of
disaster
the
instinctive
posture
of
grief
is
a
shuffling
compromise
between
defiance
and
prostration
and
pride
feels
the
need
of
striking
a
worthier
attitude
in
face
of
such
a
foe
grancy
by
nature
musing
and
retrospective
had
chosen
the
rôle
of
the
man
of
action
who
answers
blow
for
blow
and
opposes
a
mailed
front
to
the
thrusts
of
destiny
and
the
completeness
of
the
equipment
testified
to
his
inner
weakness
we
talked
only
of
what
we
were
not
thinking
of
and
parted
after
a
few
days
with
a
sense
of
relief
that
proved
the
inadequacy
of
friendship
to
perform
in
such
cases
the
office
assigned
to
it
by
tradition
soon
afterward
my
own
work
called
me
home
but
grancy
remained
several
years
in
europe
international
diplomacy
kept
its
promise
of
giving
him
work
to
do
and
during
the
year
in
which
he
acted
as
d
he
acquitted
himself
under
trying
conditions
with
conspicuous
zeal
and
discretion
a
political
redistribution
of
matter
removed
him
from
office
just
as
he
had
proved
his
usefulness
to
the
government
and
the
following
summer
i
heard
that
he
had
come
home
and
was
down
at
his
place
in
the
country
on
my
return
to
town
i
wrote
him
and
his
reply
came
by
the
next
post
he
answered
as
it
were
in
his
natural
voice
urging
me
to
spend
the
following
sunday
with
him
and
suggesting
that
i
should
bring
down
any
of
the
old
set
who
could
be
persuaded
to
join
me
i
thought
this
a
good
sign
and
yet
shall
i
own
it
i
was
vaguely
disappointed
perhaps
we
are
apt
to
feel
that
our
friends
sorrows
should
be
kept
like
those
historic
monuments
from
which
the
encroaching
ivy
is
periodically
removed
that
very
evening
at
the
club
i
ran
across
claydon
i
told
him
of
grancy
s
invitation
and
proposed
that
we
should
go
down
together
but
he
pleaded
an
engagement
i
was
sorry
for
i
had
always
felt
that
he
and
i
stood
nearer
ralph
than
the
others
and
if
the
old
sundays
were
to
be
renewed
i
should
have
preferred
that
we
two
should
spend
the
first
alone
with
him
i
said
as
much
to
claydon
and
offered
to
fit
my
time
to
his
but
he
met
this
by
a
general
refusal
i
don
t
want
to
go
to
grancy
s
he
said
bluntly
i
waited
a
moment
but
he
appended
no
qualifying
clause
you
ve
seen
him
since
he
came
back
i
finally
ventured
claydon
nodded
and
is
he
so
awfully
bad
bad
no
he
s
all
all
right
how
can
he
be
unless
he
s
changed
beyond
all
recognition
oh
you
ll
recognize
said
claydon
with
a
puzzling
deflection
of
emphasis
his
ambiguity
was
beginning
to
exasperate
me
and
i
felt
myself
shut
out
from
some
knowledge
to
which
i
had
as
good
a
right
as
he
you
ve
been
down
there
already
i
suppose
yes
i
ve
been
down
and
you
ve
done
with
each
other
the
partnership
is
dissolved
done
with
each
other
i
wish
to
god
we
had
he
rose
nervously
and
tossed
aside
the
review
from
which
my
approach
had
diverted
him
look
here
he
said
standing
before
me
ralph
s
the
best
fellow
going
and
there
s
nothing
under
heaven
i
wouldn
t
do
for
him
short
of
going
down
there
and
with
that
he
walked
out
of
the
room
claydon
was
incalculable
enough
for
me
to
read
a
dozen
different
meanings
into
his
words
but
none
of
my
interpretations
satisfied
me
i
determined
at
any
rate
to
seek
no
farther
for
a
companion
and
the
next
sunday
i
travelled
down
to
grancy
s
alone
he
met
me
at
the
station
and
i
saw
at
once
that
he
had
changed
since
our
last
meeting
then
he
had
been
in
fighting
array
but
now
if
he
and
grief
still
housed
together
it
was
no
longer
as
enemies
physically
the
transformation
was
as
marked
but
less
reassuring
if
the
spirit
triumphed
the
body
showed
its
scars
at
he
was
gray
and
stooping
with
the
tired
gait
of
an
old
man
his
serenity
however
was
not
the
resignation
of
age
i
saw
that
he
did
not
mean
to
drop
out
of
the
game
almost
immediately
he
began
to
speak
of
our
old
interests
not
with
an
effort
as
at
our
former
meeting
but
simply
and
naturally
in
the
tone
of
a
man
whose
life
has
flowed
back
into
its
normal
channels
i
remembered
with
a
touch
of
how
i
had
distrusted
his
reconstructive
powers
but
my
admiration
for
his
reserved
force
was
now
tinged
by
the
sense
that
after
all
such
happiness
as
his
ought
to
have
been
paid
with
his
last
coin
the
feeling
grew
as
we
neared
the
house
and
i
found
how
inextricably
his
wife
was
interwoven
with
my
remembrance
of
the
place
how
the
whole
scene
was
but
an
extension
of
that
vivid
presence
within
doors
nothing
was
changed
and
my
hand
would
have
dropped
without
surprise
into
her
welcoming
clasp
it
was
and
grancy
led
me
at
once
to
the
where
the
walls
the
furniture
the
very
plate
and
porcelain
seemed
a
mirror
in
which
a
moment
since
her
face
had
been
reflected
i
wondered
whether
grancy
under
the
recovered
tranquillity
of
his
smile
concealed
the
same
sense
of
her
nearness
saw
perpetually
between
himself
and
the
actual
her
bright
unappeasable
ghost
he
spoke
of
her
once
or
twice
in
an
easy
incidental
way
and
her
name
seemed
to
hang
in
the
air
after
he
had
uttered
it
like
a
chord
that
continues
to
vibrate
if
he
felt
her
presence
it
was
evidently
as
an
enveloping
medium
the
moral
atmosphere
in
which
he
breathed
i
had
never
before
known
how
completely
the
dead
may
survive
after
luncheon
we
went
for
a
long
walk
through
the
autumnal
fields
and
woods
and
dusk
was
falling
when
we
the
house
grancy
led
the
way
to
the
library
where
at
this
hour
his
wife
had
always
welcomed
us
back
to
a
bright
fire
and
a
cup
of
tea
the
room
faced
the
west
and
held
a
clear
light
of
its
own
after
the
rest
of
the
house
had
grown
dark
i
remembered
how
young
she
had
looked
in
this
pale
gold
light
which
irradiated
her
eyes
and
hair
or
silhouetted
her
girlish
outline
as
she
passed
before
the
windows
of
all
the
rooms
the
library
was
most
peculiarly
hers
and
here
i
felt
that
her
nearness
might
take
visible
shape
then
all
in
a
moment
as
grancy
opened
the
door
the
feeling
vanished
and
a
kind
of
resistance
met
me
on
the
threshold
i
looked
about
me
was
the
room
changed
had
some
desecrating
hand
effaced
the
traces
of
her
presence
no
here
too
the
setting
was
undisturbed
my
feet
sank
into
the
same
daghestan
the
bookshelves
took
the
firelight
on
the
same
rows
of
rich
subdued
bindings
her
armchair
stood
in
its
old
place
near
the
and
from
the
opposite
wall
her
face
confronted
me
her
face
but
it
hers
i
moved
nearer
and
stood
looking
up
at
the
portrait
grancy
s
glance
had
followed
mine
and
i
heard
him
move
to
my
side
you
see
a
change
in
it
he
said
what
does
it
mean
i
asked
it
means
that
five
years
have
over
why
not
look
at
me
he
pointed
to
his
gray
hair
and
furrowed
temples
what
do
you
think
kept
so
young
it
was
happiness
but
now
he
looked
up
at
her
with
infinite
tenderness
i
like
her
better
so
he
said
it
s
what
she
would
have
have
wished
that
we
should
grow
old
together
do
you
think
she
would
have
wanted
to
be
left
behind
i
stood
speechless
my
gaze
travelling
from
his
worn
features
to
the
painted
face
above
it
was
not
furrowed
like
his
but
a
veil
of
years
seemed
to
have
descended
on
it
the
bright
hair
had
lost
its
elasticity
the
cheek
its
clearness
the
brow
its
light
the
whole
woman
had
waned
grancy
laid
his
hand
on
my
arm
you
don
t
like
it
he
said
sadly
like
it
i
i
ve
lost
her
i
burst
out
and
i
ve
found
her
he
answered
in
i
cried
with
a
reproachful
gesture
yes
in
he
swung
round
on
me
almost
defiantly
the
other
had
become
a
sham
a
lie
this
is
the
way
she
would
have
looked
does
look
i
mean
claydon
ought
to
know
oughtn
t
he
i
turned
suddenly
did
claydon
do
this
for
you
grancy
nodded
since
your
return
yes
i
sent
for
him
after
i
d
been
back
a
week
he
turned
away
and
gave
a
thrust
to
the
smouldering
fire
i
followed
glad
to
leave
the
picture
behind
me
grancy
threw
himself
into
a
chair
near
the
hearth
so
that
the
light
fell
on
his
sensitive
variable
face
he
leaned
his
head
back
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hand
and
began
to
speak
iii
you
fellows
knew
enough
of
my
early
history
to
a
guess
what
my
second
marriage
meant
to
me
i
say
guess
because
no
one
could
understand
really
i
ve
always
had
a
feminine
streak
in
me
i
suppose
the
need
of
a
pair
of
eyes
that
should
see
with
me
of
a
pulse
that
should
keep
time
with
mine
life
is
a
big
thing
of
course
a
magnificent
spectacle
but
i
got
so
tired
of
looking
at
it
alone
still
it
s
always
good
to
live
and
i
had
plenty
of
happiness
of
the
evolved
kind
what
i
d
never
had
a
taste
of
was
the
simple
inconscient
sort
that
one
breathes
in
like
the
air
well
i
met
her
it
was
like
finding
the
climate
in
which
i
was
meant
to
live
you
know
what
she
was
how
indefinitely
she
multiplied
one
s
points
of
contact
with
life
how
she
lit
up
the
caverns
and
bridged
the
abysses
well
i
swear
to
you
though
i
suppose
the
sense
of
all
that
was
latent
in
me
that
what
i
used
to
think
of
on
my
way
home
at
the
end
of
the
day
was
simply
that
when
i
opened
this
door
she
d
be
sitting
over
there
with
the
falling
in
a
particular
way
on
one
little
curl
in
her
neck
when
claydon
painted
her
he
caught
just
the
look
she
used
to
lift
to
mine
when
i
came
in
i
ve
wondered
sometimes
at
his
knowing
how
she
looked
when
she
and
i
were
how
i
rejoiced
in
that
picture
i
used
to
say
to
her
you
re
my
prisoner
now
i
shall
never
lose
you
if
you
grew
tired
of
me
and
left
me
you
d
leave
your
real
self
there
on
the
wall
it
was
always
one
of
our
jokes
that
she
was
going
to
grow
tired
of
me
three
years
of
it
and
then
she
died
it
was
so
sudden
that
there
was
no
change
no
diminution
it
was
as
if
she
had
suddenly
become
fixed
immovable
like
her
own
portrait
as
if
time
had
ceased
at
its
happiest
hour
just
as
claydon
had
thrown
down
his
brush
one
day
and
said
i
can
t
do
better
than
i
went
away
as
you
know
and
stayed
over
there
five
years
i
worked
as
hard
as
i
knew
how
and
after
the
first
black
months
a
little
light
stole
in
on
me
from
thinking
that
she
would
have
been
interested
in
what
i
was
doing
i
came
to
feel
that
she
interested
that
she
was
there
and
that
she
knew
i
m
not
talking
any
psychical
jargon
i
m
simply
trying
to
express
the
sense
i
had
that
an
influence
so
full
so
abounding
as
hers
couldn
t
pass
like
a
spring
shower
we
had
so
lived
into
each
other
s
hearts
and
minds
that
the
consciousness
of
what
she
would
have
thought
and
felt
illuminated
all
i
did
at
first
she
used
to
come
back
shyly
tentatively
as
though
not
sure
of
finding
me
then
she
stayed
longer
and
longer
till
at
last
she
became
again
the
very
air
i
breathed
there
were
bad
moments
of
course
when
her
nearness
mocked
me
with
the
loss
of
the
real
woman
but
gradually
the
distinction
between
the
two
was
effaced
and
the
mere
thought
of
her
grew
warm
as
flesh
and
blood
then
i
came
home
i
landed
in
the
morning
and
came
straight
down
here
the
thought
of
seeing
her
portrait
possessed
me
and
my
heart
beat
like
a
lover
s
as
i
opened
the
library
door
it
was
in
the
afternoon
and
the
room
was
full
of
light
it
fell
on
her
picture
the
picture
of
a
young
and
radiant
woman
she
smiled
at
me
coldly
across
the
distance
that
divided
us
i
had
the
feeling
that
she
didn
t
even
recognize
me
and
then
i
caught
sight
of
myself
in
the
mirror
over
there
a
broken
man
whom
she
had
never
known
for
a
week
we
two
lived
together
the
strange
woman
and
the
strange
man
i
used
to
sit
night
after
night
and
question
her
smiling
face
but
no
answer
ever
came
what
did
she
know
of
me
after
all
we
were
irrevocably
separated
by
the
five
years
of
life
that
lay
between
us
at
times
as
i
sat
here
i
almost
grew
to
hate
her
for
her
presence
had
driven
away
my
gentle
ghost
the
real
wife
who
had
wept
aged
struggled
with
me
during
those
awful
years
it
was
the
worst
loneliness
i
ve
ever
known
then
gradually
i
began
to
notice
a
look
of
sadness
in
the
picture
s
eyes
a
look
that
seemed
to
say
don
t
you
see
that
am
lonely
too
and
all
at
once
it
came
over
me
how
she
would
have
hated
to
be
left
behind
i
remembered
her
comparing
life
to
a
heavy
book
that
could
not
be
read
with
ease
unless
two
people
held
it
together
and
i
thought
how
impatiently
her
hand
would
have
turned
the
pages
that
divided
us
so
the
idea
came
to
me
it
s
the
picture
that
stands
between
us
the
picture
that
is
dead
and
not
my
wife
to
sit
in
this
room
is
to
keep
watch
beside
a
as
this
feeling
grew
on
me
the
portrait
became
like
a
beautiful
mausoleum
in
which
she
had
been
buried
alive
i
could
hear
her
beating
against
the
painted
walls
and
crying
to
me
faintly
for
help
one
day
i
found
i
couldn
t
stand
it
any
longer
and
i
sent
for
claydon
he
came
down
and
i
told
him
what
i
d
been
through
and
what
i
wanted
him
to
do
at
first
he
refused
to
touch
the
picture
the
next
morning
i
went
off
for
a
long
tramp
and
when
i
came
home
i
found
him
sitting
here
alone
he
looked
at
me
sharply
for
a
moment
and
then
he
said
i
ve
changed
my
mind
i
ll
do
i
arranged
one
of
the
north
rooms
as
a
studio
and
he
shut
himself
up
there
for
a
day
then
he
sent
for
me
the
picture
stood
there
as
you
see
it
now
it
was
as
though
she
d
met
me
on
the
threshold
and
taken
me
in
her
arms
i
tried
to
thank
him
to
tell
him
what
it
meant
to
me
but
he
cut
me
short
there
s
an
up
train
at
five
isn
t
there
he
asked
i
m
booked
for
a
dinner
i
shall
just
have
time
to
make
a
bolt
for
the
station
and
you
can
send
my
traps
after
i
haven
t
seen
him
since
i
can
guess
what
it
cost
him
to
lay
hands
on
his
masterpiece
but
after
all
to
him
it
was
only
a
picture
lost
to
me
it
was
my
wife
regained
iv
after
that
for
ten
years
or
more
i
watched
the
strange
spectacle
of
a
life
of
hopeful
and
productive
effort
based
on
the
structure
of
a
dream
there
could
be
no
doubt
to
those
who
saw
grancy
during
this
period
that
he
drew
his
strength
and
courage
from
the
sense
of
his
wife
s
mystic
participation
in
his
task
when
i
went
back
to
see
him
a
few
months
later
i
found
the
portrait
had
been
removed
from
the
library
and
placed
in
a
small
study
to
which
he
had
transferred
his
desk
and
a
few
books
he
told
me
he
always
sat
there
when
he
was
alone
keeping
the
library
for
his
sunday
visitors
those
who
missed
the
portrait
of
course
made
no
comment
on
its
absence
and
the
few
who
were
in
his
secret
respected
it
gradually
all
his
old
friends
had
gathered
about
him
and
our
sunday
afternoons
regained
something
of
their
former
character
but
claydon
never
reappeared
among
us
as
i
look
back
now
i
see
that
grancy
must
have
been
failing
from
the
time
of
his
return
home
his
invincible
spirit
belied
and
disguised
the
signs
of
weakness
that
afterward
asserted
themselves
in
my
remembrance
of
him
he
seemed
to
have
an
inexhaustible
fund
of
life
to
draw
on
and
more
than
one
of
us
was
a
pensioner
on
his
superfluity
nevertheless
when
i
came
back
one
summer
from
my
european
holiday
and
heard
that
he
had
been
at
the
point
of
death
i
understood
at
once
that
we
had
believed
him
well
only
because
he
wished
us
to
i
hastened
down
to
the
country
and
found
him
midway
in
a
slow
convalescence
i
felt
then
that
he
was
lost
to
us
and
he
read
my
thought
at
a
glance
ah
he
said
i
m
an
old
man
now
and
no
mistake
i
suppose
we
shall
have
to
go
after
this
but
we
shan
t
need
towing
just
yet
the
plural
pronoun
struck
me
and
involuntarily
i
looked
up
at
grancy
s
portrait
line
by
line
i
saw
my
fear
reflected
in
it
it
was
the
face
of
a
woman
who
knows
that
her
husband
is
dying
my
heart
stood
still
at
the
thought
of
what
claydon
had
done
grancy
had
followed
my
glance
yes
it
s
changed
her
he
said
quietly
for
months
you
know
it
was
touch
and
go
with
me
we
had
a
long
fight
of
it
and
it
was
worse
for
her
than
for
after
a
pause
he
added
claydon
has
been
very
kind
he
s
so
busy
nowadays
that
i
seldom
see
him
but
when
i
sent
for
him
the
other
day
he
came
down
at
i
was
silent
and
we
spoke
no
more
of
grancy
s
illness
but
when
i
took
leave
it
seemed
like
shutting
him
in
alone
with
his
the
next
time
i
went
down
to
see
him
he
looked
much
better
it
was
a
sunday
and
he
received
me
in
the
library
so
that
i
did
not
see
the
portrait
again
he
continued
to
improve
and
toward
spring
we
began
to
feel
that
as
he
had
said
he
might
yet
travel
a
long
way
without
being
towed
one
evening
on
returning
to
town
after
a
visit
which
had
confirmed
my
sense
of
reassurance
i
found
claydon
dining
alone
at
the
club
he
asked
me
to
join
him
and
over
the
coffee
our
talk
turned
to
his
work
if
you
re
not
too
busy
i
said
at
length
you
ought
to
make
time
to
go
down
to
grancy
s
he
looked
up
quickly
why
he
asked
because
he
s
quite
well
again
i
returned
with
a
touch
of
cruelty
his
wife
s
prognostications
were
claydon
stared
at
me
a
moment
oh
knows
he
affirmed
with
a
smile
that
chilled
me
you
mean
to
leave
the
portrait
as
it
is
then
i
persisted
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
hasn
t
sent
for
me
yet
a
waiter
came
up
with
the
cigars
and
claydon
rose
and
joined
another
group
it
was
just
a
fortnight
later
that
grancy
s
housekeeper
telegraphed
for
me
she
met
me
at
the
station
with
the
news
that
he
had
been
taken
bad
and
that
the
doctors
were
with
him
i
had
to
wait
for
some
time
in
the
deserted
library
before
the
medical
men
appeared
they
had
the
baffled
manner
of
empirics
who
have
been
superseded
by
the
great
healer
and
i
lingered
only
long
enough
to
hear
that
grancy
was
not
suffering
and
that
my
presence
could
do
him
no
harm
i
found
him
seated
in
his
in
the
little
study
he
held
out
his
hand
with
a
smile
you
see
she
was
right
after
all
he
said
she
i
repeated
perplexed
for
the
moment
my
he
indicated
the
picture
of
course
i
knew
she
had
no
hope
from
the
first
i
saw
that
he
lowered
his
voice
after
claydon
had
been
here
but
i
wouldn
t
believe
it
at
first
i
caught
his
hands
in
mine
for
god
s
sake
don
t
believe
it
now
i
adjured
him
he
shook
his
head
gently
it
s
too
late
he
said
i
might
have
known
that
she
but
grancy
listen
to
me
i
began
and
then
i
stopped
what
could
i
say
that
would
convince
him
there
was
no
common
ground
of
argument
on
which
we
could
meet
and
after
all
it
would
be
easier
for
him
to
die
feeling
that
she
known
strangely
enough
i
saw
that
claydon
had
missed
his
mark
v
grancy
s
will
named
me
as
one
of
his
executors
and
my
associate
having
other
duties
on
his
hands
begged
me
to
assume
the
task
of
carrying
out
our
friend
s
wishes
this
placed
me
under
the
necessity
of
informing
claydon
that
the
portrait
of
grancy
had
been
bequeathed
to
him
and
he
replied
by
the
next
post
that
he
would
send
for
the
picture
at
once
i
was
staying
in
the
deserted
house
when
the
portrait
was
taken
away
and
as
the
door
closed
on
it
i
felt
that
grancy
s
presence
had
vanished
too
was
it
his
turn
to
follow
her
now
and
could
one
ghost
haunt
another
after
that
for
a
year
or
two
i
heard
nothing
more
of
the
picture
and
though
i
met
claydon
from
time
to
time
we
had
little
to
say
to
each
other
i
had
no
definable
grievance
against
the
man
and
i
tried
to
remember
that
he
had
done
a
fine
thing
in
sacrificing
his
best
picture
to
a
friend
but
my
resentment
had
all
the
tenacity
of
unreason
one
day
however
a
lady
whose
portrait
he
had
just
finished
begged
me
to
go
with
her
to
see
it
to
refuse
was
impossible
and
i
went
with
the
less
reluctance
that
i
knew
i
was
not
the
only
friend
she
had
invited
the
others
were
all
grouped
around
the
easel
when
i
entered
and
after
contributing
my
share
to
the
chorus
of
approval
i
turned
away
and
began
to
stroll
about
the
studio
claydon
was
something
of
a
collector
and
his
things
were
generally
worth
looking
at
the
studio
was
a
long
tapestried
room
with
a
curtained
archway
at
one
end
the
curtains
were
looped
back
showing
a
smaller
apartment
with
books
and
flowers
and
a
few
fine
bits
of
bronze
and
porcelain
the
standing
in
this
inner
room
proclaimed
that
it
was
open
to
inspection
and
i
wandered
in
a
vase
first
attracted
me
then
i
turned
to
examine
a
slender
bronze
ganymede
and
in
so
doing
found
myself
face
to
face
with
grancy
s
portrait
i
stared
up
at
her
blankly
and
she
smiled
back
at
me
in
all
the
recovered
radiance
of
youth
the
artist
had
effaced
every
trace
of
his
later
touches
and
the
original
picture
had
reappeared
it
throned
alone
on
the
panelled
wall
asserting
a
brilliant
supremacy
over
its
surroundings
i
felt
in
an
instant
that
the
whole
room
was
tributary
to
it
that
claydon
had
heaped
his
treasures
at
the
feet
of
the
woman
he
loved
yes
it
was
the
woman
he
had
loved
and
not
the
picture
and
my
instinctive
resentment
was
explained
suddenly
i
felt
a
hand
on
my
shoulder
ah
how
could
you
i
cried
turning
on
him
how
could
i
he
retorted
how
could
i
doesn
t
she
belong
to
me
now
i
moved
away
impatiently
wait
a
moment
he
said
with
a
detaining
gesture
the
others
have
gone
and
i
want
to
say
a
word
to
oh
i
know
what
you
ve
thought
of
me
i
can
guess
you
think
i
killed
grancy
i
suppose
i
was
startled
by
his
sudden
vehemence
i
think
you
tried
to
do
a
cruel
thing
i
said
ah
what
a
little
way
you
others
see
into
life
he
murmured
sit
down
a
moment
here
where
we
can
look
at
her
and
i
ll
tell
he
threw
himself
on
the
ottoman
beside
me
and
sat
gazing
up
at
the
picture
with
his
hands
clasped
about
his
knee
pygmalion
he
began
slowly
turned
his
statue
into
a
real
woman
turned
my
real
woman
into
a
picture
small
compensation
you
think
but
you
don
t
know
how
much
of
a
woman
belongs
to
you
after
you
ve
painted
her
well
i
made
the
best
of
it
at
any
rate
i
gave
her
the
best
i
had
in
me
and
she
gave
me
in
return
what
such
a
woman
gives
by
merely
being
and
after
all
she
rewarded
me
enough
by
making
me
paint
as
i
shall
never
paint
again
there
was
one
side
of
her
though
that
was
mine
alone
and
that
was
her
beauty
for
no
one
else
understood
it
to
grancy
even
it
was
the
mere
expression
of
herself
what
language
is
to
thought
even
when
he
saw
the
picture
he
didn
t
guess
my
secret
he
was
so
sure
she
was
all
his
as
though
a
man
should
think
he
owned
the
moon
because
it
was
reflected
in
the
pool
at
his
door
well
when
he
came
home
and
sent
for
me
to
change
the
picture
it
was
like
asking
me
to
commit
murder
he
wanted
me
to
make
an
old
woman
of
her
of
her
who
had
been
so
divinely
unchangeably
young
as
if
any
man
who
really
loved
a
woman
would
ask
her
to
sacrifice
her
youth
and
beauty
for
his
sake
at
first
i
told
him
i
couldn
t
do
it
but
afterward
when
he
left
me
alone
with
the
picture
something
queer
happened
i
suppose
it
was
because
i
was
always
so
confoundedly
fond
of
grancy
that
it
went
against
me
to
refuse
what
he
asked
anyhow
as
i
sat
looking
up
at
her
she
seemed
to
say
i
m
not
yours
but
his
and
i
want
you
to
make
me
what
he
and
so
i
did
it
i
could
have
cut
my
hand
off
when
the
work
was
done
i
daresay
he
told
you
i
never
would
go
back
and
look
at
it
he
thought
i
was
too
busy
he
never
understood
well
and
then
last
year
he
sent
for
me
again
you
remember
it
was
after
his
illness
and
he
told
me
he
d
grown
twenty
years
older
and
that
he
wanted
her
to
grow
older
too
he
didn
t
want
her
to
be
left
behind
the
doctors
all
thought
he
was
going
to
get
well
at
that
time
and
he
thought
so
too
and
so
did
i
when
i
first
looked
at
him
but
when
i
turned
to
the
picture
ah
now
i
don
t
ask
you
to
believe
me
but
i
swear
it
was
face
that
told
me
he
was
dying
and
that
she
wanted
him
to
know
it
she
had
a
message
for
him
and
she
made
me
deliver
he
rose
abruptly
and
walked
toward
the
portrait
then
he
sat
down
beside
me
again
cruel
yes
it
seemed
so
to
me
at
first
and
this
time
if
i
resisted
it
was
for
sake
and
not
for
mine
but
all
the
while
i
felt
her
eyes
drawing
me
and
gradually
she
made
me
understand
if
she
d
been
there
in
the
flesh
she
seemed
to
say
wouldn
t
she
have
seen
before
any
of
us
that
he
was
dying
wouldn
t
he
have
read
the
news
first
in
her
face
and
wouldn
t
it
be
horrible
if
now
he
should
discover
it
instead
in
strange
eyes
well
that
was
what
she
wanted
of
me
and
i
did
it
i
kept
them
together
to
the
last
he
looked
up
at
the
picture
again
but
now
she
belongs
to
me
he
repeated
the
confessional
when
i
was
a
young
man
i
thought
a
great
deal
of
local
color
at
that
time
it
was
still
a
pigment
of
recent
discovery
and
supposed
to
have
a
peculiarly
stimulating
effect
on
the
mental
eye
as
an
aid
to
the
imagination
its
value
was
perhaps
overrated
but
as
an
object
of
pursuit
to
that
vagrant
faculty
it
had
all
the
merits
claimed
for
it
i
certainly
never
hunted
any
game
better
worth
my
powder
and
to
a
young
man
with
rare
holidays
and
long
working
hours
its
value
was
enhanced
by
the
fact
that
one
might
bring
it
down
at
any
turn
if
only
one
kept
one
s
eye
alert
and
one
s
hand
on
the
trigger
even
the
large
manufacturing
city
where
for
some
years
my
young
enthusiasms
were
chained
to
an
accountant
s
desk
was
not
without
its
romantic
opportunities
many
of
the
at
dunstable
were
italians
and
a
foreign
settlement
had
formed
itself
in
that
unsavory
and
unsanitary
portion
of
the
town
known
as
the
point
the
point
like
more
aristocratic
communities
had
its
residential
and
commercial
districts
its
church
its
theatre
and
its
restaurant
when
the
craving
for
local
color
was
on
me
it
was
my
habit
to
resort
to
the
restaurant
a
wooden
building
with
the
appetizing
announcement
di
pasted
in
one
of
its
here
the
consumption
of
tough
macaroni
or
of
an
ambiguous
sufficed
to
transport
me
to
the
cappello
d
oro
in
venice
while
my
cup
of
coffee
and
a
cigar
with
a
straw
in
it
turned
my
greasy
into
the
marble
top
of
one
of
the
little
round
tables
under
the
arcade
of
the
caffè
pedrotti
at
padua
this
feat
of
the
imagination
was
materially
aided
by
agostino
the
and
waiter
whose
slimy
napkin
never
lost
its
latin
flourish
and
whose
zeal
for
my
comfort
was
not
infrequently
displayed
by
his
testing
the
warmth
of
my
soup
with
his
finger
through
agostino
i
became
acquainted
with
the
inner
history
of
the
colony
heard
the
details
of
its
feuds
and
vendettas
and
learned
to
know
by
sight
the
leading
characters
in
these
domestic
dramas
the
restaurant
was
frequented
by
the
chief
personages
of
the
community
the
overseer
of
the
italian
hands
at
the
meriton
mills
the
doctor
his
wife
the
a
plump
neapolitan
with
greasy
ringlets
a
plush
and
a
charm
against
the
hanging
in
a
crease
of
her
neck
and
lastly
by
don
egidio
the
of
the
little
church
across
the
street
the
doctor
and
his
wife
came
only
on
feast
days
but
the
overseer
and
don
egidio
were
regular
patrons
the
former
was
a
quiet
man
of
accomplished
manners
but
reluctant
speech
and
i
depended
for
my
diversion
chiefly
on
don
egidio
whose
large
lips
were
always
ajar
for
conversation
the
remarks
issuing
from
them
were
richly
tinged
by
the
gutturals
of
the
bergamasque
dialect
and
it
needed
but
a
slight
acquaintance
with
italian
types
to
detect
the
lombard
peasant
under
the
priest
s
rusty
cassock
this
inference
was
confirmed
by
don
egidio
s
telling
me
that
he
came
from
a
village
of
val
camonica
the
radiant
valley
which
extends
northward
from
the
lake
of
iseo
to
the
adamello
glaciers
his
had
been
a
laborer
on
one
of
the
of
a
milanese
count
who
owned
large
estates
in
the
val
camonica
and
that
gentleman
taking
a
fancy
to
the
lad
whom
he
had
seen
at
work
in
his
orchards
had
removed
him
to
his
villa
on
the
lake
of
iseo
and
had
subsequently
educated
him
for
the
church
it
was
doubtless
to
this
picturesque
accident
that
don
egidio
owed
the
mingling
of
ease
and
simplicity
that
gave
an
inimitable
charm
to
his
stout
shabby
presence
it
was
as
though
some
wild
had
been
transplanted
to
the
count
s
orchards
and
had
mellowed
under
cultivation
without
losing
its
sylvan
flavor
i
have
never
seen
the
social
art
carried
farther
without
suggestion
of
artifice
the
fact
that
don
egidio
s
amenities
were
mainly
exercised
on
the
composing
his
parish
proved
the
genuineness
of
his
gift
it
is
easier
to
simulate
gentility
among
gentlemen
than
among
navvies
and
the
plain
man
is
a
touchstone
who
draws
out
all
the
alloy
in
the
gold
among
his
parishioners
don
egidio
ruled
with
the
cheerful
despotism
of
the
good
priest
on
cardinal
points
he
was
inflexible
but
in
minor
matters
he
had
that
elasticity
of
judgment
which
enables
the
catholic
discipline
to
fit
itself
to
every
inequality
of
the
human
conscience
there
was
no
appeal
from
his
verdict
but
his
was
a
revolving
chair
from
which
he
could
view
the
same
act
at
various
angles
his
influence
was
acknowledged
not
only
by
his
flock
but
by
the
policeman
at
the
corner
the
in
the
dive
the
ward
politician
in
the
corner
grocery
the
general
verdict
of
dunstable
was
that
the
point
would
have
been
hell
without
the
priest
it
was
perhaps
not
precisely
heaven
with
him
but
such
light
of
the
upper
sky
as
pierced
its
murky
atmosphere
was
reflected
from
don
egidio
s
countenance
it
is
hardly
possible
for
any
one
to
exercise
such
influence
without
taking
pleasure
in
it
and
on
the
whole
the
priest
was
probably
a
contented
man
though
it
does
not
follow
that
he
was
a
happy
one
on
this
point
the
first
stages
of
our
acquaintance
yielded
much
food
for
conjecture
at
first
sight
don
egidio
was
the
image
of
cheerfulness
he
had
all
the
physical
indications
of
a
mind
at
ease
the
leisurely
rolling
gait
the
ready
laugh
the
hospitable
eye
of
the
man
whose
sympathies
are
always
on
the
latch
it
took
me
some
time
to
discover
under
his
surface
garrulity
the
impenetrable
reticence
of
his
profession
and
under
his
enjoyment
of
trifles
a
levelling
melancholy
which
made
all
enjoyment
trifling
don
egidio
s
aspect
and
conversation
were
so
unsuggestive
of
psychological
complexities
that
i
set
down
this
trait
to
poverty
or
there
are
few
classes
of
men
more
frugal
in
tastes
and
habit
than
the
village
priest
in
italy
but
don
egidio
by
his
own
account
had
been
introduced
at
an
impressionable
age
to
a
way
of
living
that
must
have
surpassed
his
wildest
dreams
of
to
whatever
privations
his
parochial
work
had
since
accustomed
him
the
influences
of
that
earlier
life
were
too
perceptible
in
his
talk
not
to
have
made
a
profound
impression
on
his
tastes
and
he
remained
for
all
his
apostolic
simplicity
the
image
of
the
family
priest
who
has
his
seat
at
the
rich
man
s
table
it
chanced
that
i
had
used
one
of
my
short
european
holidays
to
explore
afoot
the
romantic
passes
connecting
the
valtelline
with
the
lake
of
iseo
and
my
remembrance
of
that
enchanting
region
made
it
seem
impossible
that
don
egidio
should
ever
look
without
a
reminiscent
pang
on
the
grimy
perspective
of
his
parochial
streets
the
transition
was
too
complete
too
ironical
from
those
rich
glades
and
titianesque
acclivities
to
the
brick
hovels
and
fissured
sidewalks
of
the
point
this
impression
was
confirmed
when
don
egidio
in
response
to
my
urgent
invitation
paid
his
first
visit
to
my
modest
lodgings
he
called
one
winter
evening
when
a
in
its
happiest
humor
was
giving
a
factitious
lustre
to
my
and
bringing
out
the
values
of
the
one
or
two
old
prints
and
chinese
porcelains
that
accounted
for
the
perennial
shabbiness
of
my
wardrobe
ah
said
he
with
a
murmur
of
satisfaction
as
he
laid
aside
his
shiny
hat
and
bulging
umbrella
it
is
a
long
time
since
i
have
been
in
a
my
remembrance
of
his
own
room
he
lodged
with
the
doctor
and
the
saved
this
epithet
from
the
suggestion
of
irony
and
kept
me
silent
while
he
sank
into
my
with
the
deliberation
of
a
tired
traveller
lowering
himself
gently
into
a
warm
bath
good
good
he
repeated
looking
about
him
books
porcelains
objects
of
i
am
glad
to
see
that
there
are
still
such
things
in
the
world
and
he
turned
a
genial
eye
on
the
glass
of
marsala
that
i
had
poured
out
for
him
don
egidio
was
the
most
temperate
of
men
and
never
exceeded
his
one
glass
but
he
liked
to
sit
by
the
hour
puffing
at
my
cabañas
which
i
suspected
him
of
preferring
to
the
black
weed
of
his
native
country
under
the
influence
of
my
tobacco
he
became
even
more
blandly
garrulous
and
i
sometimes
fancied
that
of
all
the
obligations
of
his
calling
none
could
have
placed
such
a
strain
on
him
as
that
of
preserving
the
secrets
of
the
confessional
he
often
talked
of
his
early
life
at
the
count
s
villa
where
he
had
been
educated
with
his
patron
s
two
sons
till
he
was
of
age
to
be
sent
to
the
seminary
and
i
could
see
that
the
years
spent
in
simple
and
familiar
intercourse
with
his
benefactors
had
been
the
most
vivid
chapter
in
his
experience
the
italian
peasant
s
inarticulate
tenderness
for
the
beauty
of
his
birthplace
had
been
specialized
in
him
by
contact
with
cultivated
tastes
and
he
could
tell
me
not
only
that
the
count
had
a
stupendous
collection
of
pictures
but
that
the
chapel
of
the
villa
contained
a
sepulchral
monument
by
bambaja
and
that
the
were
divided
as
to
the
authenticity
of
the
leonardo
in
the
family
palace
at
milan
on
all
these
subjects
he
was
inexhaustibly
voluble
but
there
was
one
point
which
he
always
avoided
and
that
was
his
reason
for
coming
to
america
i
remember
the
round
turn
with
which
he
brought
me
up
when
i
questioned
him
a
priest
said
he
is
a
soldier
and
must
obey
orders
like
a
he
set
down
his
glass
of
marsala
and
strolled
across
the
room
i
had
not
observed
he
went
on
that
you
have
here
a
photograph
of
the
sposalizio
of
the
brera
what
a
picture
and
he
turned
back
to
his
seat
and
smilingly
lit
a
fresh
cigar
i
saw
at
once
that
i
had
hit
on
a
point
where
his
native
garrulity
was
protected
by
the
of
religious
discipline
that
every
catholic
priest
wears
beneath
his
cassock
i
had
too
much
respect
for
my
friend
to
wish
to
penetrate
his
armor
and
now
and
then
i
almost
fancied
he
was
grateful
to
me
for
not
putting
his
reticence
to
the
test
don
egidio
must
have
been
past
sixty
when
i
made
his
acquaintance
but
it
was
not
till
the
close
of
an
exceptionally
harsh
winter
some
five
or
six
years
after
our
first
meeting
that
i
began
to
think
of
him
as
an
old
man
it
was
as
though
the
cold
had
cracked
and
shrivelled
him
he
had
grown
bent
and
and
his
lower
lip
shook
like
an
unhinged
door
the
summer
heat
did
little
to
revive
him
and
in
september
when
i
came
home
from
my
vacation
i
found
him
just
recovering
from
an
attack
of
pneumonia
that
autumn
he
did
not
care
to
venture
often
into
the
night
air
and
now
and
then
i
used
to
go
and
sit
with
him
in
his
little
room
to
which
i
had
contributed
the
luxuries
of
an
and
a
my
engagements
however
made
these
visits
infrequent
and
several
weeks
had
elapsed
without
my
seeing
the
when
one
snowy
november
morning
i
ran
across
him
in
the
i
was
on
my
way
to
new
york
for
the
day
and
had
just
time
to
wave
a
greeting
to
him
as
i
jumped
into
the
but
a
moment
later
to
my
surprise
i
saw
him
stiffly
clambering
into
the
same
train
i
found
him
seated
in
the
common
car
with
his
umbrella
between
his
knees
and
a
bundle
done
up
in
a
red
cotton
handkerchief
on
the
seat
at
his
side
the
caution
with
which
at
my
approach
he
transferred
this
bundle
to
his
arms
caused
me
to
glance
at
it
in
surprise
and
he
answered
my
look
by
saying
with
a
smile
they
are
flowers
for
the
dead
the
most
exquisite
flowers
from
the
greenhouses
of
meriton
and
he
waved
a
descriptive
hand
one
of
my
lads
gianpietro
is
employed
by
the
gardener
there
and
every
year
on
this
day
he
brings
me
a
beautiful
bunch
of
flowers
for
such
a
purpose
it
is
no
sin
he
added
with
the
charming
italian
pliancy
of
judgment
and
why
are
you
travelling
in
this
snowy
weather
i
asked
as
he
ended
with
a
cough
he
fixed
me
gravely
with
his
simple
shallow
eye
because
it
is
the
day
of
the
dead
my
son
he
said
and
i
go
to
place
these
on
the
grave
of
the
noblest
man
that
ever
you
are
going
to
new
york
to
brooklyn
i
hesitated
a
moment
wishing
to
question
him
yet
uncertain
whether
his
replies
were
curtailed
by
the
persistency
of
his
cough
or
by
the
desire
to
avoid
interrogation
this
is
no
weather
to
be
travelling
with
such
a
cough
i
said
at
length
he
made
a
deprecating
gesture
i
have
never
missed
the
day
not
once
in
eighteen
years
but
for
me
he
would
have
no
one
he
folded
his
hands
on
his
umbrella
and
looked
away
from
me
to
hide
the
trembling
of
his
lip
i
resolved
on
a
last
attempt
to
storm
his
confidence
your
friend
is
buried
in
calvary
cemetery
he
signed
an
assent
that
is
a
long
way
for
you
to
go
alone
the
streets
are
sure
to
be
slippery
and
there
is
an
icy
wind
blowing
give
me
your
flowers
and
let
me
send
them
to
the
cemetery
by
a
messenger
i
give
you
my
word
they
shall
reach
their
destination
he
turned
a
quiet
look
on
me
my
son
you
are
young
he
said
and
you
don
t
know
how
the
dead
need
he
drew
his
breviary
from
his
pocket
and
opened
it
with
a
smile
scusi
he
murmured
the
business
which
had
called
me
to
town
obliged
me
to
part
from
him
as
soon
as
the
train
entered
the
station
and
in
my
dash
for
the
street
i
left
his
unwieldy
figure
laboring
far
behind
me
through
the
crowd
on
the
platform
before
we
separated
however
i
had
learned
that
he
was
returning
to
dunstable
by
the
four
o
clock
train
and
had
resolved
to
despatch
my
business
in
time
to
travel
home
with
him
when
i
reached
wall
street
i
was
received
with
the
news
that
the
man
i
had
appointed
to
meet
was
ill
and
detained
in
the
country
my
business
was
off
and
i
found
myself
with
the
rest
of
the
day
at
my
disposal
i
had
no
difficulty
in
deciding
how
to
employ
my
time
i
was
at
an
age
when
in
such
contingencies
there
is
always
a
feminine
alternative
and
even
now
i
don
t
know
how
it
was
that
on
my
way
to
a
certain
hospitable
i
suddenly
found
myself
in
a
cab
which
was
carrying
me
at
to
the
street
ferry
it
was
not
till
i
had
bought
my
ticket
and
seated
myself
in
the
varnished
tunnel
of
the
that
i
was
aware
of
having
been
diverted
from
my
purpose
by
an
overmastering
anxiety
for
don
egidio
i
rapidly
calculated
that
he
had
not
more
than
an
hour
s
advance
on
me
and
that
allowing
for
my
greater
agility
and
for
the
fact
that
i
had
a
cab
at
my
call
i
was
likely
to
reach
the
cemetery
in
time
to
see
him
under
shelter
before
the
gusts
of
sleet
that
were
already
sweeping
across
the
river
had
thickened
to
a
at
the
gates
of
the
cemetery
i
began
to
take
a
less
sanguine
view
of
my
attempt
the
commemorative
anniversary
had
filled
the
silent
avenues
with
visitors
and
i
felt
the
futility
of
my
quest
as
i
tried
to
fix
the
gatekeeper
s
attention
on
my
delineation
of
a
stout
italian
priest
with
a
bad
cough
and
a
bunch
of
flowers
tied
up
in
a
red
cotton
handkerchief
the
showed
that
delusive
desire
to
oblige
that
is
certain
to
send
its
victims
in
the
wrong
direction
but
i
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
go
exactly
contrary
to
his
indication
and
thanks
to
this
precaution
i
came
after
half
an
hour
s
search
on
the
figure
of
my
poor
kneeling
on
the
wet
ground
in
one
of
the
humblest
of
the
great
necropolis
the
mound
before
which
he
knelt
was
strewn
with
the
spoils
of
meriton
s
conservatories
and
on
the
tablet
at
its
head
i
read
the
inscription
il
conte
siviano
da
milano
flumina
babylonis
illic
sedimus
et
so
engrossed
was
don
egidio
that
for
some
moments
i
stood
behind
him
unobserved
and
when
he
rose
and
faced
me
grief
had
left
so
little
room
for
any
minor
emotion
that
he
looked
at
me
almost
without
surprise
don
egidio
i
said
i
have
a
carriage
waiting
for
you
at
the
gate
you
must
come
home
with
he
nodded
quietly
and
i
drew
his
hand
through
my
arm
he
turned
back
to
the
grave
one
moment
my
son
he
said
it
may
be
for
the
last
he
stood
motionless
his
eyes
on
the
flowers
which
were
already
bruised
and
blackened
by
the
cold
to
leave
him
alone
after
sixty
years
but
god
is
everywhere
he
murmured
as
i
led
him
away
on
the
journey
home
he
did
not
care
to
talk
and
my
chief
concern
was
to
keep
him
wrapped
in
my
greatcoat
and
to
see
that
his
bed
was
made
ready
as
soon
as
i
had
restored
him
to
his
lodgings
the
brought
a
quilted
coverlet
from
her
own
room
and
hovered
over
him
as
gently
as
though
he
had
been
of
the
sex
to
require
her
services
while
agostino
at
my
summons
appeared
with
a
bowl
of
hot
soup
that
was
heralded
down
the
street
by
a
reviving
waft
of
garlic
to
these
ministrations
i
left
the
intending
to
call
for
news
of
him
the
next
evening
but
an
unexpected
pressure
of
work
kept
me
late
at
my
desk
and
the
following
day
some
fresh
obstacle
delayed
me
on
the
third
afternoon
as
i
was
leaving
the
office
an
infant
from
the
point
hailed
me
with
a
message
from
the
doctor
the
was
worse
and
had
asked
for
me
i
jumped
into
the
nearest
car
and
ten
minutes
later
was
running
up
the
doctor
s
greasy
stairs
to
my
dismay
i
found
don
egidio
s
room
cold
and
untenanted
but
i
was
reassured
a
moment
later
by
the
appearance
of
the
who
announced
that
she
had
transferred
the
blessed
man
to
her
own
apartment
where
he
could
have
the
sunlight
and
a
good
bed
to
lie
in
there
in
fact
he
lay
weak
but
smiling
in
a
setting
which
contrasted
oddly
enough
with
his
own
monastic
surroundings
a
cheerful
grimy
room
hung
with
anecdotic
chromos
photographs
of
proudly
presenting
their
offspring
to
the
camera
and
innumerable
neapolitan
decked
out
with
shrivelled
the
whispered
that
the
good
man
had
the
pleurisy
and
that
as
she
phrased
it
he
was
nearing
his
last
i
saw
that
he
was
in
fact
in
a
bad
way
but
his
condition
did
not
indicate
any
pressing
danger
and
i
had
the
presentiment
that
he
would
still
as
the
saying
is
put
up
a
good
fight
it
was
clear
however
that
he
knew
what
turn
the
conflict
must
take
and
the
solemnity
with
which
he
welcomed
me
showed
that
my
summons
was
a
part
of
that
spiritual
strategy
with
which
the
catholic
opposes
the
surprise
of
death
my
son
he
said
when
the
had
left
us
i
have
a
favor
to
ask
you
you
found
me
yesterday
bidding
to
my
best
his
cough
interrupted
him
i
have
never
told
you
he
went
on
the
name
of
the
family
in
which
i
was
brought
up
it
was
siviano
and
that
was
the
grave
of
the
count
s
eldest
son
with
whom
i
grew
up
as
a
brother
for
eighteen
years
he
has
lain
in
that
strange
ground
terra
and
when
i
die
there
will
be
no
one
to
care
for
his
i
saw
what
he
waited
for
i
will
care
for
it
i
knew
i
should
have
your
promise
my
child
and
what
you
promise
you
keep
but
my
friend
is
a
stranger
to
you
you
are
young
and
at
your
age
life
is
a
mistress
who
kisses
away
sad
memories
why
should
you
remember
the
grave
of
a
stranger
i
can
not
lay
such
a
claim
on
you
but
i
will
tell
you
his
story
and
then
i
think
that
neither
joy
nor
grief
will
let
you
forget
him
for
when
you
rejoice
you
will
remember
how
he
sorrowed
and
when
you
sorrow
the
thought
of
him
will
be
like
a
friend
s
hand
in
ii
you
tell
me
don
egidio
began
that
you
know
our
little
lake
and
if
you
have
seen
it
you
will
understand
why
it
always
used
to
remind
me
of
the
garden
enclosed
of
the
canticles
inclusus
columba
mea
in
foraminibus
the
words
used
to
come
back
to
me
whenever
i
returned
from
a
day
s
journey
across
the
mountains
and
looking
down
saw
the
blue
lake
far
below
hidden
in
its
hills
like
a
happy
secret
in
a
stern
heart
we
were
never
envious
of
the
glory
of
the
great
lakes
they
are
like
the
show
pictures
that
some
nobleman
hangs
in
his
public
gallery
but
our
iseo
is
the
treasure
that
he
hides
in
his
inner
chamber
you
tell
me
you
saw
it
in
summer
when
it
looks
up
like
a
saint
s
eye
reflecting
the
whole
of
heaven
it
was
then
too
that
i
first
saw
it
my
future
friend
the
old
count
had
found
me
at
work
on
one
of
his
up
the
valley
and
hearing
that
i
was
by
my
a
drunken
pedlar
from
the
val
mastellone
whom
my
poor
mother
a
year
or
two
earlier
had
come
across
at
the
fair
of
lovere
he
had
taken
me
home
with
him
to
iseo
i
used
to
serve
mass
in
our
of
cerveno
and
the
village
children
called
me
the
little
priest
because
when
my
work
was
done
i
often
crept
back
to
the
church
to
get
away
from
my
s
blows
and
curses
i
will
make
a
real
priest
of
him
the
count
declared
and
that
afternoon
perched
on
the
box
of
his
i
was
whirled
away
from
the
dark
scenes
of
my
childhood
into
a
world
where
as
it
seemed
to
me
every
one
was
as
happy
as
an
angel
on
a
i
wonder
if
you
remember
the
count
s
villa
it
lies
on
the
shore
of
the
lake
facing
the
green
knoll
of
monte
isola
and
overlooked
by
the
village
of
siviano
and
by
the
old
where
i
said
mass
for
fifteen
happy
years
the
village
hangs
on
a
ledge
of
the
mountain
but
the
villa
dips
its
foot
in
the
lake
smiling
at
its
reflection
like
a
bather
lingering
on
the
brink
what
paradise
it
seemed
to
me
that
day
in
our
church
up
the
valley
there
hung
an
old
brown
picture
with
a
saint
sabastian
in
the
foreground
and
behind
him
the
most
wonderful
palace
with
terraced
gardens
adorned
with
statues
and
fountains
where
fine
folk
in
resplendent
dresses
walked
up
and
down
without
heeding
the
blessed
martyr
s
pangs
the
count
s
villa
with
its
terraces
its
roses
its
marble
steps
descending
to
the
lake
reminded
me
of
that
palace
only
instead
of
being
inhabited
by
wicked
people
engrossed
in
their
selfish
pleasures
it
was
the
home
of
the
kindest
friends
that
ever
took
a
poor
lad
by
the
hand
the
old
count
was
a
widower
when
i
first
knew
him
he
had
been
twice
married
and
his
first
wife
had
left
him
two
children
a
son
and
a
daughter
the
eldest
donna
marianna
was
then
a
girl
of
twenty
who
kept
her
father
s
house
and
was
a
mother
to
the
two
lads
she
was
not
handsome
or
learned
and
had
no
taste
for
the
world
but
she
was
like
the
in
a
poor
man
s
window
just
a
little
gray
flower
but
a
sweetness
that
fills
the
whole
house
her
brother
count
roberto
had
been
ailing
from
his
birth
and
was
a
studious
lad
with
a
melancholy
musing
face
such
as
you
may
see
in
some
of
titian
s
portraits
of
young
men
he
looked
like
an
exiled
prince
dressed
in
mourning
there
was
one
child
by
the
second
marriage
count
andrea
a
boy
of
my
own
age
handsome
as
a
saint
george
but
not
as
kind
as
the
others
no
doubt
being
younger
he
was
less
able
to
understand
why
an
uncouth
peasant
lad
should
have
been
brought
to
his
father
s
table
and
the
others
were
so
fearful
of
hurting
my
feelings
that
but
for
his
teasing
i
might
never
have
mended
my
clumsy
manners
or
learned
how
to
behave
in
the
presence
of
my
betters
count
andrea
was
not
sparing
in
such
lessons
and
count
roberto
in
spite
of
his
weak
arms
chastised
his
brother
roundly
when
he
thought
the
discipline
had
been
too
severe
but
for
my
part
it
seemed
to
me
natural
enough
that
such
a
godlike
being
should
lord
it
over
a
poor
clodhopper
like
myself
well
i
will
not
linger
over
the
beginning
of
my
new
life
for
my
story
has
to
do
with
its
close
only
i
should
like
to
make
you
understand
what
the
change
meant
to
me
an
ignorant
peasant
lad
coming
from
hard
words
and
blows
and
a
hut
in
the
hills
to
that
great
house
full
of
rare
and
beautiful
things
and
of
beings
who
seemed
to
me
even
more
rare
and
beautiful
do
you
wonder
i
was
ready
to
kiss
the
ground
they
trod
and
would
have
given
the
last
drop
of
my
blood
to
serve
them
in
due
course
i
was
sent
to
the
seminary
at
lodi
and
on
holidays
i
used
to
visit
the
family
in
milan
count
andrea
was
growing
up
to
be
one
of
the
handsomest
young
men
imaginable
but
a
trifle
wild
and
the
old
count
married
him
in
haste
to
the
daughter
of
a
venetian
noble
who
brought
as
her
dower
a
great
estate
in
istria
the
countess
gemma
as
this
lady
was
called
was
as
light
as
thistledown
and
had
an
eye
like
a
baby
s
but
while
she
was
cooing
for
the
moon
her
pretty
white
hands
were
always
stealing
toward
something
within
reach
that
she
had
not
been
meant
to
have
the
old
count
was
not
alert
enough
to
follow
these
manoeuvres
and
the
countess
hid
her
designs
under
a
torrent
of
guileless
chatter
as
wear
long
sleeves
to
conceal
their
movements
her
only
fault
he
used
to
say
was
that
one
of
her
aunts
had
married
an
austrian
and
this
event
having
taken
place
before
she
was
born
he
laughingly
acquitted
her
of
any
direct
share
in
it
she
confirmed
his
good
opinion
of
her
by
giving
her
husband
two
sons
and
roberto
showing
no
inclination
to
marry
these
boys
naturally
came
to
be
looked
on
as
the
heirs
of
the
house
meanwhile
i
had
finished
my
course
of
studies
and
the
old
count
on
my
birthday
had
appointed
me
priest
of
the
parish
of
siviano
it
was
the
year
of
count
andrea
s
marriage
and
there
were
great
festivities
at
the
villa
three
years
later
the
old
count
died
to
the
sorrow
of
his
two
eldest
children
donna
marianna
and
count
roberto
closed
their
apartments
in
the
palace
at
milan
and
withdrew
for
a
year
to
siviano
it
was
then
that
i
first
began
to
know
my
friend
before
that
i
had
loved
him
without
understanding
him
now
i
learned
of
what
metal
he
was
made
his
bookish
tastes
inclined
him
to
a
secluded
way
of
living
and
his
younger
brother
perhaps
fancied
that
he
would
not
care
to
assume
the
charge
of
the
estate
but
if
andrea
thought
this
he
was
disappointed
roberto
resolutely
took
up
the
tradition
of
his
father
s
rule
and
as
if
conscious
of
lacking
the
old
count
s
easy
way
with
the
peasants
made
up
for
it
by
a
redoubled
zeal
for
their
welfare
i
have
seen
him
toil
for
days
to
adjust
some
trifling
difficulty
that
his
father
would
have
set
right
with
a
ready
word
like
the
sainted
bishop
who
when
a
beggar
asked
him
for
a
penny
cried
out
alas
my
brother
i
have
not
a
penny
in
my
purse
but
here
are
two
gold
pieces
if
they
can
be
made
to
serve
you
instead
we
had
many
conferences
over
the
condition
of
his
people
and
he
often
sent
me
up
the
valley
to
look
into
the
needs
of
the
peasantry
on
the
no
grievance
was
too
trifling
for
him
to
consider
it
no
abuse
too
for
him
to
root
it
out
and
many
an
hour
that
other
men
of
his
rank
would
have
given
to
books
or
pleasure
was
devoted
to
adjusting
a
quarrel
about
or
to
weighing
the
merits
of
a
complaint
against
the
i
often
said
that
he
was
as
much
his
people
s
priest
as
i
and
he
smiled
and
answered
that
every
landowner
was
a
king
and
that
in
old
days
the
king
was
always
a
priest
donna
marianna
was
urgent
with
him
to
marry
but
he
always
declared
that
he
had
a
family
in
his
tenantry
and
that
as
for
a
wife
she
had
never
let
him
feel
the
want
of
one
he
had
that
musing
temper
which
gives
a
man
a
name
for
coldness
though
in
fact
he
may
all
the
while
be
storing
fuel
for
a
great
conflagration
but
to
me
he
whispered
another
reason
for
not
marrying
a
man
he
said
does
not
take
wife
and
rejoice
while
his
mother
is
on
her
and
italy
his
mother
lay
dying
with
the
foreign
vultures
waiting
to
tear
her
apart
you
are
too
young
to
know
anything
of
those
days
my
son
and
how
can
any
one
understand
them
who
did
not
live
through
them
italy
lay
dying
indeed
but
lombardy
was
her
heart
and
the
heart
still
beat
and
sent
the
faint
blood
creeping
to
her
cold
extremities
her
torturers
weary
of
their
work
had
allowed
her
to
fall
into
a
painless
stupor
but
just
as
she
was
sinking
from
sleep
to
death
heaven
sent
radetsky
to
scourge
her
back
to
consciousness
and
at
the
first
sting
of
his
lash
she
sprang
maimed
and
bleeding
to
her
feet
ah
those
days
those
days
my
son
italy
italy
was
the
word
on
our
lips
but
the
thought
in
our
hearts
was
just
we
clamored
for
liberty
unity
the
franchise
but
under
our
breath
we
prayed
only
to
smite
the
remove
the
beam
from
our
eye
we
cried
and
we
shall
see
our
salvation
clearly
enough
we
priests
in
the
north
were
all
liberals
and
worked
with
the
nobles
and
the
men
of
letters
gioberti
was
our
breviary
and
his
holiness
the
new
pope
was
soon
to
be
the
tancred
of
our
crusade
but
meanwhile
mind
you
all
this
went
on
in
silence
underground
as
it
were
while
on
the
surface
lombardy
still
danced
feasted
married
and
took
office
under
the
austrian
in
the
up
our
valley
there
used
to
be
certain
miners
who
stayed
below
ground
for
months
at
a
time
and
like
one
of
these
roberto
remained
buried
in
his
purpose
while
life
went
its
way
overhead
though
i
was
not
in
his
confidence
i
knew
well
enough
where
his
thoughts
were
for
he
went
among
us
with
the
eye
of
a
lover
the
visionary
look
of
one
who
hears
a
voice
we
all
heard
that
voice
to
be
sure
mingling
faintly
with
the
other
noises
of
life
but
to
roberto
it
was
already
as
the
roar
of
mighty
waters
drowning
every
other
sound
with
its
thunder
on
the
surface
as
i
have
said
things
looked
smooth
enough
an
austrian
cardinal
throned
in
milan
and
an
pope
ruled
in
rome
in
lombardy
austria
couched
like
a
beast
of
prey
ready
to
spring
at
our
throats
if
we
stirred
or
struggled
the
moderates
to
whose
party
count
roberto
belonged
talked
of
prudence
compromise
the
education
of
the
masses
but
if
their
words
were
a
velvet
sheath
their
thought
was
a
dagger
for
many
years
as
you
know
the
milanese
had
maintained
an
outward
show
of
friendliness
with
their
rulers
the
nobles
had
accepted
office
under
the
and
in
the
past
there
had
been
frequent
intermarriage
between
the
two
aristocracies
but
now
one
by
one
the
great
houses
had
closed
their
doors
against
official
society
though
some
of
the
younger
and
more
careless
those
who
must
dance
and
dine
at
any
cost
still
went
to
the
palace
and
sat
beside
the
enemy
at
the
opera
fashion
was
gradually
taking
sides
against
them
and
those
who
had
once
been
laughed
at
as
old
fogeys
were
now
applauded
as
patriots
among
these
of
course
was
count
roberto
who
for
several
years
had
refused
to
associate
with
the
austrians
and
had
silently
resented
his
brother
s
disregard
of
political
distinctions
andrea
and
gemma
belonged
to
the
moth
tribe
who
flock
to
the
brightest
light
and
gemma
s
istrian
possessions
and
her
family
s
connection
with
the
austrian
nobility
gave
them
a
pretext
for
fluttering
about
the
candle
roberto
let
them
go
their
way
but
his
own
course
was
a
tacit
protest
against
their
conduct
they
were
always
welcome
at
the
palazzo
siviano
but
he
and
donna
marianna
withdrew
from
society
in
order
to
have
an
excuse
for
not
showing
themselves
at
the
countess
gemma
s
entertainments
if
andrea
and
gemma
were
aware
of
his
disapproval
they
were
clever
enough
to
ignore
it
for
the
rich
elder
brother
who
paid
their
debts
and
never
meant
to
marry
was
too
important
a
person
to
be
quarrelled
with
on
political
grounds
they
seemed
to
think
that
if
he
married
it
would
be
only
to
spite
them
and
they
were
persuaded
that
their
future
depended
on
their
giving
him
no
cause
to
take
such
reprisals
i
shall
never
be
more
than
a
plain
peasant
at
heart
and
i
have
little
natural
skill
in
discerning
hidden
motives
but
the
experience
of
the
confessional
gives
every
priest
a
certain
insight
into
the
secret
springs
of
action
and
i
often
wondered
that
the
worldly
wisdom
of
andrea
and
gemma
did
not
help
them
to
a
clearer
reading
of
their
brother
s
character
for
my
part
i
knew
that
in
roberto
s
heart
no
great
passion
could
spring
from
a
mean
motive
and
i
had
always
thought
that
if
he
ever
loved
any
woman
as
he
loved
italy
it
must
be
from
his
country
s
hand
that
he
received
his
bride
and
so
it
came
about
have
you
ever
noticed
on
one
of
those
still
autumn
days
before
a
storm
how
here
and
there
a
yellow
leaf
will
suddenly
detach
itself
from
the
bough
and
whirl
through
the
air
as
though
some
warning
of
the
gale
had
reached
it
so
it
was
then
in
lombardy
all
round
was
the
silence
of
decay
but
now
and
then
a
word
a
look
a
trivial
incident
fluttered
ominously
through
the
stillness
it
was
in
only
a
year
earlier
the
glorious
death
of
the
bandiera
brothers
had
sent
a
long
shudder
through
italy
in
the
romagna
renzi
and
his
comrades
had
tried
to
uphold
by
action
the
protest
set
forth
in
the
manifesto
of
rimini
and
their
failure
had
sowed
the
seed
which
d
azeglio
and
cavour
were
to
harvest
everywhere
the
forces
were
silently
gathering
and
nowhere
was
the
hush
more
profound
the
least
reverberation
more
audible
than
in
the
streets
of
milan
it
was
count
roberto
s
habit
to
attend
early
mass
in
the
cathedral
and
one
morning
as
he
was
standing
in
the
aisle
a
young
girl
passed
him
with
her
father
roberto
knew
the
father
a
beggarly
milanese
of
the
noble
family
of
intelvi
who
had
cut
himself
off
from
his
class
by
accepting
an
appointment
in
one
of
the
government
offices
as
the
two
went
by
he
saw
a
group
of
austrian
officers
looking
after
the
girl
and
heard
one
of
them
say
such
a
choice
morsel
as
that
is
too
good
for
slaves
and
another
answer
with
a
laugh
yes
it
s
a
dish
for
the
master
s
table
the
girl
heard
too
she
was
as
white
as
a
and
he
saw
the
words
come
out
on
her
cheek
like
the
red
mark
from
a
blow
she
whispered
to
her
father
but
he
shook
his
head
and
drew
her
away
without
so
much
as
a
glance
at
the
austrians
roberto
heard
mass
and
then
hastened
out
and
placed
himself
in
the
porch
of
the
cathedral
a
moment
later
the
officers
appeared
and
they
too
stationed
themselves
near
the
doorway
presently
the
girl
came
out
on
her
father
s
arm
her
admirers
stepped
forward
to
greet
intelvi
and
the
cringing
wretch
stood
there
exchanging
compliments
with
them
while
their
insolent
stare
devoured
his
daughter
s
beauty
she
poor
thing
shook
like
a
leaf
and
her
eyes
in
avoiding
theirs
suddenly
encountered
roberto
s
her
look
was
a
wounded
bird
that
flew
to
him
for
shelter
he
carried
it
away
in
his
breast
and
its
live
warmth
beat
against
his
heart
he
thought
that
italy
had
looked
at
him
through
those
eyes
for
love
is
the
wiliest
of
masqueraders
and
has
a
thousand
disguises
at
his
command
within
a
month
faustina
intelvi
was
his
wife
donna
marianna
and
i
rejoiced
for
we
knew
he
had
chosen
her
because
he
loved
her
and
she
seemed
to
us
almost
worthy
of
such
a
choice
as
for
count
andrea
and
his
wife
i
leave
you
to
guess
what
ingredients
were
mingled
in
the
kiss
with
which
they
welcomed
the
bride
they
were
all
smiles
at
roberto
s
marriage
and
had
only
words
of
praise
for
his
wife
donna
marianna
who
had
sometimes
taxed
me
with
suspecting
their
motives
rejoiced
in
this
fresh
proof
of
their
magnanimity
but
for
my
part
i
could
have
wished
to
see
them
a
little
less
kind
all
such
twilight
fears
however
vanished
in
the
flush
of
my
friend
s
happiness
over
some
natures
love
steals
gradually
as
the
morning
light
widens
across
a
valley
but
it
had
flashed
on
roberto
like
the
leap
of
dawn
to
a
he
walked
the
world
with
the
wondering
step
of
a
blind
man
suddenly
restored
to
sight
and
once
he
said
to
me
with
a
laugh
love
makes
a
columbus
of
every
one
of
us
and
the
countess
the
countess
my
son
was
eighteen
and
her
husband
was
forty
count
roberto
had
the
heart
of
a
poet
but
he
walked
with
a
limp
and
his
skin
was
sallow
youth
plucks
the
fruit
for
its
color
rather
than
its
flavor
and
first
love
does
not
serenade
its
mistress
on
a
in
italy
girls
are
married
as
land
is
sold
if
two
estates
adjoin
two
lives
are
united
as
for
the
portionless
girl
she
is
a
that
goes
to
the
highest
bidder
faustina
was
handed
over
to
her
purchaser
as
if
she
had
been
a
picture
for
his
gallery
and
the
transaction
doubtless
seemed
as
natural
to
her
as
to
her
parents
she
walked
to
the
altar
like
an
iphigenia
but
pallor
becomes
a
bride
and
it
looks
well
for
a
daughter
to
weep
on
leaving
her
mother
perhaps
it
would
have
been
different
if
she
had
guessed
that
the
threshold
of
her
new
home
was
carpeted
with
love
and
its
four
corners
hung
with
tender
thoughts
of
her
but
her
husband
was
a
silent
man
who
never
called
attention
to
his
treasures
the
great
palace
in
milan
was
a
gloomy
house
for
a
girl
to
enter
roberto
and
his
sister
lived
in
it
as
if
it
had
been
a
monastery
going
nowhere
and
receiving
only
those
who
labored
for
the
cause
to
faustina
accustomed
to
the
easy
austrian
society
the
sunday
evening
receptions
at
the
palazzo
siviano
must
have
seemed
as
dreary
as
a
scientific
congress
it
pleased
roberto
to
regard
her
as
a
victim
of
barbarian
insolence
an
embodiment
of
his
country
desecrated
by
the
desire
of
the
enemy
but
though
like
any
handsome
penniless
girl
faustina
had
now
and
then
been
exposed
to
a
free
look
or
a
familiar
word
i
doubt
if
she
connected
such
incidents
with
the
political
condition
of
italy
she
knew
of
course
that
in
marrying
siviano
she
was
entering
a
house
closed
against
the
austrian
one
of
siviano
s
first
cares
had
been
to
pension
his
with
the
stipulation
that
intelvi
should
resign
his
appointment
and
give
up
all
relations
with
the
government
and
the
old
hypocrite
only
too
glad
to
purchase
idleness
on
such
terms
embraced
the
liberal
cause
with
a
zeal
which
left
his
daughter
no
excuse
for
but
he
found
it
less
easy
than
he
had
expected
to
recover
a
footing
among
his
own
people
in
spite
of
his
patriotic
bluster
the
milanese
held
aloof
from
him
and
being
the
kind
of
man
who
must
always
take
his
glass
in
company
he
gradually
drifted
back
to
his
old
associates
it
was
impossible
to
forbid
faustina
to
visit
her
parents
and
in
their
house
she
breathed
an
air
that
was
at
least
tolerant
of
austria
but
i
must
not
let
you
think
that
the
young
countess
appeared
ungrateful
or
unhappy
she
was
silent
and
shy
and
it
needed
a
more
enterprising
temper
than
roberto
s
to
break
down
the
barrier
between
them
they
seemed
to
talk
to
one
another
through
a
rather
than
across
a
hearth
but
if
roberto
had
asked
more
of
her
than
she
could
give
outwardly
she
was
a
model
wife
she
chose
me
at
once
as
her
confessor
and
i
watched
over
the
first
steps
of
her
new
life
never
was
younger
sister
tenderer
to
her
elder
than
she
to
donna
marianna
never
was
young
wife
more
mindful
of
her
religious
duties
kinder
to
her
dependents
more
charitable
to
the
poor
yet
to
be
with
her
was
like
living
in
a
room
with
shuttered
windows
she
was
always
the
caged
bird
the
transplanted
flower
for
all
roberto
s
care
she
never
bloomed
or
sang
donna
marianna
was
the
first
to
speak
of
it
the
child
needs
more
light
and
air
she
said
light
air
roberto
repeated
does
she
not
go
to
mass
every
morning
does
she
not
drive
on
the
corso
every
evening
donna
marianna
was
not
called
clever
but
her
heart
was
wiser
than
most
women
s
heads
at
our
age
brother
said
she
the
windows
of
the
mind
face
north
and
look
out
on
a
landscape
full
of
lengthening
shadows
faustina
needs
another
outlook
she
is
as
pale
as
a
hyacinth
grown
in
a
roberto
himself
turned
pale
and
i
saw
that
she
had
uttered
his
own
thought
you
want
me
to
let
her
go
to
gemma
s
he
exclaimed
let
her
go
wherever
there
is
a
little
careless
laughter
now
he
cried
with
a
gesture
toward
the
sombre
line
of
portraits
above
his
head
let
her
laugh
while
she
can
my
that
evening
after
dinner
he
called
faustina
to
him
my
child
he
said
go
and
put
on
your
jewels
your
sister
gemma
gives
a
ball
and
the
carriage
waits
to
take
you
there
i
am
too
much
of
a
recluse
to
be
at
ease
in
such
scenes
but
i
have
sent
word
to
your
father
to
go
with
andrea
and
gemma
welcomed
their
young
with
effusion
and
from
that
time
she
was
often
in
their
company
gemma
forbade
any
mention
of
politics
in
her
and
it
was
natural
that
faustina
should
be
glad
to
escape
from
the
solemn
conclaves
of
the
palazzo
siviano
to
a
house
where
life
went
as
gaily
as
in
that
villa
above
florence
where
boccaccio
s
careless
took
refuge
from
the
plague
but
meanwhile
the
political
distemper
was
rapidly
spreading
and
in
spite
of
gemma
s
austrian
affiliations
it
was
no
longer
possible
for
her
to
receive
the
enemy
openly
it
was
whispered
that
her
door
was
still
ajar
to
her
old
friends
but
the
rumor
may
have
risen
from
the
fact
that
one
of
the
austrian
cavalry
officers
stationed
at
milan
was
her
own
cousin
the
son
of
the
aunt
on
whose
misalliance
the
old
count
had
so
often
bantered
her
no
one
could
blame
the
countess
gemma
for
not
turning
her
own
flesh
and
blood
out
of
doors
and
the
social
famine
to
which
the
officers
of
the
garrison
were
reduced
made
it
natural
that
young
welkenstern
should
press
the
claims
of
consanguinity
all
this
must
have
reached
roberto
s
ears
but
he
made
no
sign
and
his
wife
came
and
went
as
she
pleased
when
they
returned
the
following
year
to
the
old
dusky
villa
at
siviano
she
was
like
the
voice
of
a
brook
in
a
twilight
wood
one
could
not
look
at
her
without
ransacking
the
spring
for
new
similes
to
paint
her
freshness
with
roberto
it
was
different
i
found
him
older
more
preoccupied
and
silent
but
i
guessed
that
his
preoccupations
were
political
for
when
his
eye
rested
on
his
wife
it
cleared
like
the
lake
when
a
lifts
from
it
count
andrea
and
his
wife
occupied
an
adjoining
villa
and
during
the
the
two
households
lived
almost
as
one
family
roberto
however
was
often
absent
in
milan
called
thither
on
business
of
which
the
nature
was
not
hard
to
guess
sometimes
he
brought
back
guests
to
the
villa
and
on
these
occasions
faustina
and
donna
marianna
went
to
count
andrea
s
for
the
day
i
have
said
that
i
was
not
in
his
confidence
but
he
knew
my
sympathies
were
with
the
liberals
and
now
and
then
he
let
fall
a
word
of
the
work
going
on
underground
meanwhile
the
new
pope
had
been
elected
and
from
piedmont
to
calabria
we
hailed
in
him
the
banner
that
was
to
lead
our
hosts
to
war
so
time
passed
and
we
reached
the
last
months
of
the
villa
on
iseo
had
been
closed
since
the
end
of
august
roberto
had
no
great
liking
for
his
gloomy
palace
in
milan
and
it
had
been
his
habit
to
spend
nine
months
of
the
year
at
siviano
but
he
was
now
too
much
engrossed
in
his
work
to
remain
away
from
milan
and
his
wife
and
sister
had
joined
him
there
as
soon
as
the
midsummer
heat
was
over
during
the
autumn
he
had
called
me
once
or
twice
to
the
city
to
consult
me
on
business
connected
with
his
and
in
the
course
of
our
talks
he
had
sometimes
let
fall
a
hint
of
graver
matters
it
was
in
july
of
that
year
that
a
troop
of
croats
had
marched
into
ferrara
with
muskets
and
cannon
loaded
the
lighted
matches
of
their
cannon
had
fired
the
sleeping
hate
of
austria
and
the
whole
country
now
echoed
the
lombard
cry
out
with
the
barbarian
all
talk
of
adjustment
compromise
reorganization
shrivelled
on
lips
that
the
live
coal
of
patriotism
had
touched
italy
for
the
italians
and
then
monarchy
federation
republic
it
mattered
not
what
the
oppressor
s
grip
had
tightened
on
our
throats
and
the
saw
well
enough
that
metternich
s
policy
was
to
provoke
a
rebellion
and
then
crush
it
under
the
croat
heel
but
it
was
too
late
to
cry
prudence
in
lombardy
with
the
first
days
of
the
new
year
the
tobacco
riots
had
drawn
blood
in
milan
soon
afterward
the
lions
club
was
closed
and
edicts
were
issued
forbidding
the
singing
of
pio
nono
s
hymn
the
wearing
of
white
and
blue
the
collecting
of
subscriptions
for
the
victims
of
the
riots
to
each
prohibition
milan
returned
a
fresh
defiance
the
ladies
of
the
nobility
put
on
mourning
for
the
rioters
who
had
been
shot
down
by
the
soldiery
half
the
members
of
the
guardia
nobile
resigned
and
count
borromeo
sent
back
his
golden
fleece
to
the
emperor
fresh
regiments
were
continually
pouring
into
milan
and
it
was
no
secret
that
radetsky
was
strengthening
the
fortifications
late
in
january
several
leading
liberals
were
arrested
and
sent
into
exile
and
two
weeks
later
martial
law
was
proclaimed
in
milan
at
the
first
arrests
several
members
of
the
liberal
party
had
hastily
left
milan
and
i
was
not
surprised
to
hear
a
few
days
later
that
orders
had
been
given
to
reopen
the
villa
at
siviano
the
count
and
countess
arrived
there
early
in
february
it
was
seven
months
since
i
had
seen
the
countess
and
i
was
struck
with
the
change
in
her
appearance
she
was
paler
than
ever
and
her
step
had
lost
its
lightness
yet
she
did
not
seem
to
share
her
husband
s
political
anxieties
one
would
have
said
that
she
was
hardly
aware
of
them
she
seemed
wrapped
in
a
veil
of
lassitude
like
iseo
on
a
still
gray
morning
when
dawn
is
on
the
mountains
but
a
mist
blurs
its
reflection
in
the
lake
i
felt
as
though
her
soul
were
slipping
away
from
me
and
longed
to
win
her
back
to
my
care
but
she
made
her
a
pretext
for
not
coming
to
confession
and
for
the
present
i
could
only
wait
and
carry
the
thought
of
her
to
the
altar
she
had
not
been
long
at
siviano
before
i
discovered
that
this
drooping
mood
was
only
one
phase
of
her
humor
now
and
then
she
flung
back
the
cowl
of
melancholy
and
laughed
life
in
the
eye
but
next
moment
she
was
in
shadow
again
and
her
muffled
thoughts
had
given
us
the
slip
she
was
like
the
lake
on
one
of
those
days
when
the
wind
blows
twenty
ways
and
every
promontory
holds
a
gust
in
ambush
meanwhile
there
was
a
continual
coming
and
going
of
messengers
between
siviano
and
the
city
they
came
mostly
at
night
when
the
household
slept
and
were
away
again
with
the
last
shadows
but
the
news
they
brought
stayed
and
widened
shining
through
every
cranny
of
the
old
house
the
whole
of
lombardy
was
up
from
pavia
to
mantua
from
como
to
brescia
the
streets
ran
blood
like
the
arteries
of
one
great
body
at
pavia
and
padua
the
universities
were
closed
the
frightened
was
preparing
to
withdraw
from
milan
to
verona
and
radetsky
continued
to
pour
his
men
across
the
alps
till
a
hundred
thousand
were
massed
between
the
piave
and
the
ticino
and
now
every
eye
was
turned
to
turin
ah
how
we
watched
for
the
blue
banner
of
piedmont
on
the
mountains
charles
albert
was
pledged
to
our
cause
his
whole
people
had
armed
to
rescue
us
the
streets
echoed
with
savoia
and
yet
savoy
was
silent
and
hung
back
each
day
was
a
strained
to
the
with
hopes
and
disappointments
we
reckoned
the
hours
by
rumors
the
very
minutes
by
hearsay
then
suddenly
ah
it
was
worth
living
through
word
came
to
us
that
vienna
was
in
revolt
the
points
of
the
compass
had
shifted
and
our
sun
had
risen
in
the
north
i
shall
never
forget
that
day
at
the
villa
roberto
sent
for
me
early
and
i
found
him
smiling
and
resolute
as
becomes
a
soldier
on
the
eve
of
action
he
had
made
all
his
preparations
to
leave
for
milan
and
was
awaiting
a
summons
from
his
party
the
whole
household
felt
that
great
events
impended
and
donna
marianna
awed
and
tearful
had
pleaded
with
her
brother
that
they
should
all
receive
the
sacrament
together
the
next
morning
roberto
and
his
sister
had
been
to
confession
the
previous
day
but
the
countess
faustina
had
again
excused
herself
i
did
not
see
her
while
i
was
with
the
count
but
as
i
left
the
house
she
met
me
in
the
the
morning
was
damp
and
cold
and
she
had
drawn
a
black
scarf
over
her
hair
and
walked
with
a
listless
dragging
step
but
at
my
approach
she
lifted
her
head
quickly
and
signed
to
me
to
follow
her
into
one
of
the
recesses
of
clipped
laurel
that
bordered
the
path
don
egidio
she
said
you
have
heard
the
news
i
assented
the
count
goes
to
milan
it
seems
probable
your
there
will
be
fighting
we
are
on
the
eve
of
war
i
mean
we
are
in
god
s
hands
your
in
god
s
hands
she
murmured
her
eyes
wandered
and
for
a
moment
we
stood
silent
then
she
drew
a
purse
from
her
pocket
i
was
forgetting
she
exclaimed
this
is
for
that
poor
girl
you
spoke
to
me
about
the
other
day
what
was
her
name
the
girl
who
met
the
austrian
soldier
at
the
fair
at
peschiera
ah
vannina
i
said
but
she
is
dead
your
dead
she
turned
white
and
the
purse
dropped
from
her
hand
i
picked
it
up
and
held
it
out
to
her
but
she
put
back
my
hand
that
is
for
masses
then
she
said
and
with
that
she
moved
away
toward
the
house
i
walked
on
to
the
gate
but
before
i
had
reached
it
i
heard
her
step
behind
me
don
egidio
she
called
and
i
turned
back
you
are
coming
to
say
mass
in
the
chapel
morning
that
is
the
count
s
she
wavered
a
moment
i
am
not
well
enough
to
walk
up
to
the
village
this
afternoon
she
said
at
length
will
you
come
back
later
and
hear
my
confession
here
willingly
your
come
at
sunset
she
looked
at
me
gravely
it
is
a
long
time
since
i
have
been
to
confession
she
added
my
child
the
door
of
heaven
is
always
she
made
no
answer
and
i
went
my
way
i
returned
to
the
villa
a
little
before
sunset
hoping
for
a
few
words
with
roberto
i
felt
with
faustina
that
we
were
on
the
eve
of
war
and
the
uncertainty
of
the
outlook
made
me
treasure
every
moment
of
my
friend
s
company
i
knew
he
had
been
busy
all
day
but
hoped
to
find
that
his
preparations
were
ended
and
that
he
could
spare
me
a
half
hour
i
was
not
disappointed
for
the
servant
who
met
me
asked
me
to
follow
him
to
the
count
s
apartment
roberto
was
sitting
alone
with
his
back
to
the
door
at
a
table
spread
with
maps
and
papers
he
stood
up
and
turned
an
ashen
face
on
me
roberto
i
cried
as
if
we
had
been
boys
together
he
signed
to
me
to
be
seated
egidio
he
said
suddenly
my
wife
has
sent
for
you
to
confess
her
the
countess
met
me
on
my
way
home
this
morning
and
expressed
a
wish
to
receive
the
sacrament
morning
with
you
and
donna
marianna
and
i
promised
to
return
this
afternoon
to
hear
her
roberto
sat
silent
staring
before
him
as
though
he
hardly
heard
at
length
he
raised
his
head
and
began
to
speak
you
have
noticed
lately
that
my
wife
has
been
ailing
he
asked
every
one
must
have
seen
that
the
countess
is
not
in
her
usual
health
she
has
seemed
nervous
out
of
spirits
i
have
fancied
that
she
might
be
anxious
about
your
he
leaned
across
the
table
and
laid
his
wasted
hand
on
mine
call
me
roberto
he
said
there
was
another
pause
before
he
went
on
since
i
saw
you
this
morning
he
said
slowly
something
horrible
has
happened
after
you
left
i
sent
for
andrea
and
gemma
to
tell
them
the
news
from
vienna
and
the
probability
of
my
being
summoned
to
milan
before
night
you
know
as
well
as
i
that
we
have
reached
a
crisis
there
will
be
fighting
within
hours
if
i
know
my
people
and
war
may
follow
sooner
than
we
think
i
felt
it
my
duty
to
leave
my
affairs
in
andrea
s
hands
and
to
entrust
my
wife
to
his
care
don
t
look
startled
he
added
with
a
faint
smile
no
reasonable
man
goes
on
a
journey
without
setting
his
house
in
order
and
if
things
take
the
turn
i
expect
it
may
be
some
months
before
you
see
me
back
at
but
it
was
not
to
hear
this
that
i
sent
for
he
pushed
his
chair
aside
and
walked
up
and
down
the
room
with
his
short
limping
step
my
god
he
broke
out
wildly
how
can
i
say
it
when
andrea
had
heard
me
i
saw
him
exchange
a
glance
with
his
wife
and
she
said
with
that
infernal
sweet
voice
of
hers
yes
andrea
it
is
our
your
duty
i
asked
what
is
your
duty
andrea
wetted
his
lips
with
his
tongue
and
looked
at
her
again
and
her
look
was
like
a
blade
in
his
hand
your
wife
has
a
lover
he
said
she
caught
my
arm
as
i
flung
myself
on
him
he
is
ten
times
stronger
than
i
but
you
remember
how
i
made
him
howl
for
mercy
in
the
old
days
when
he
used
to
bully
you
let
me
go
i
said
to
his
wife
he
must
live
to
unsay
andrea
began
to
whimper
oh
my
poor
brother
i
would
give
my
heart
s
blood
to
unsay
it
the
secret
has
been
killing
us
she
chimed
in
the
secret
whose
secret
how
dare
you
gemma
fell
on
her
knees
like
a
tragedy
actress
strike
me
kill
me
it
is
i
who
am
the
offender
it
was
at
my
house
that
she
met
him
him
franz
welkenstern
my
cousin
she
wailed
i
suppose
i
stood
before
them
like
a
stunned
ox
for
they
repeated
the
name
again
and
again
as
if
they
were
not
sure
of
my
having
heard
not
hear
it
he
cried
suddenly
dropping
into
a
chair
and
hiding
his
face
in
his
hands
shall
i
ever
on
earth
hear
anything
else
again
he
sat
a
long
time
with
his
face
hidden
and
i
waited
my
head
was
like
a
great
bronze
bell
with
one
thought
for
the
clapper
after
a
while
he
went
on
in
a
low
deliberate
voice
as
though
his
words
were
balancing
themselves
on
the
brink
of
madness
with
strange
composure
he
repeated
each
detail
of
his
brother
s
charges
the
meetings
in
the
countess
gemma
s
the
innocent
friendliness
of
the
two
young
people
the
talk
of
mysterious
visits
to
a
villa
outside
the
porta
ticinese
the
circle
of
scandal
that
had
spread
about
their
names
at
first
andrea
said
he
and
his
wife
had
refused
to
listen
to
the
reports
which
reached
them
then
when
the
talk
became
too
loud
they
had
sent
for
welkenstern
remonstrated
with
him
implored
him
to
exchange
into
another
regiment
but
in
vain
the
young
officer
indignantly
denied
the
reports
and
declared
that
to
leave
his
post
at
such
a
moment
would
be
desertion
with
a
laborious
accuracy
roberto
went
on
detailing
one
by
one
each
incident
of
the
hateful
story
till
suddenly
he
cried
out
springing
from
his
chair
and
now
to
leave
her
with
this
lie
unburied
his
cry
was
like
the
lifting
of
a
from
my
breast
you
must
not
leave
her
i
exclaimed
he
shook
his
head
i
am
this
is
your
first
it
would
be
any
other
man
s
not
an
italian
i
was
silent
in
those
days
the
argument
seemed
unanswerable
at
length
i
said
no
harm
can
come
to
her
while
you
are
away
donna
marianna
and
i
are
here
to
watch
over
her
and
when
you
come
back
he
looked
at
me
gravely
i
come
back
roberto
we
are
men
egidio
we
both
know
what
is
coming
milan
is
up
already
and
there
is
a
rumor
that
charles
albert
is
moving
this
year
the
spring
rains
will
be
red
in
in
your
absence
not
a
breath
shall
touch
her
and
if
i
never
come
back
to
defend
her
they
hate
her
as
hell
hates
egidio
they
kept
repeating
he
is
of
her
own
age
and
youth
draws
youth
she
is
in
their
way
egidio
consider
my
son
they
do
not
love
her
perhaps
but
why
should
they
hate
her
at
such
cost
she
has
given
you
no
no
child
he
paused
but
what
if
she
has
ailed
lately
he
cried
and
broke
off
to
grapple
with
the
stabbing
thought
roberto
roberto
i
adjured
him
he
jumped
up
and
gripped
my
arm
egidio
you
believe
in
her
she
s
as
pure
as
a
lily
on
the
altar
those
eyes
are
wells
of
truth
and
she
has
been
like
a
daughter
to
egidio
do
i
look
like
an
old
man
quiet
yourself
roberto
i
entreated
quiet
myself
with
this
sting
in
my
blood
a
lover
and
an
austrian
lover
oh
italy
italy
my
bride
i
stake
my
life
on
her
truth
i
cried
and
who
knows
better
than
i
has
her
soul
not
lain
before
me
like
the
bed
of
a
clear
stream
and
if
what
you
saw
there
was
only
the
reflection
of
your
faith
in
her
my
son
i
am
a
priest
and
the
priest
penetrates
to
the
soul
as
the
angel
passed
through
the
walls
of
peter
s
prison
i
see
the
truth
in
her
heart
as
i
see
christ
in
the
host
no
no
she
is
false
he
cried
i
sprang
up
terrified
roberto
be
silent
he
looked
at
me
with
a
wild
incredulous
smile
poor
simple
man
of
god
he
said
i
would
not
exchange
my
simplicity
for
yours
the
dupe
of
envy
s
first
malicious
whisper
envy
you
think
that
is
it
questionable
you
would
stake
your
life
on
it
my
life
your
faith
my
faith
your
vows
as
a
priest
my
vows
i
stopped
and
stared
at
him
he
had
risen
and
laid
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
you
see
now
what
i
would
be
at
he
said
quietly
i
must
take
your
place
presently
my
place
when
my
wife
comes
down
you
understand
ah
now
you
are
quite
mad
i
cried
breaking
away
from
him
am
i
he
returned
maintaining
his
strange
composure
consider
a
moment
she
has
not
confessed
to
you
before
since
our
return
from
milan
her
he
cut
me
short
with
a
gesture
yet
she
sends
for
you
in
order
that
she
may
receive
the
sacrament
with
you
on
the
eve
of
your
first
if
that
is
her
only
reason
her
first
words
will
clear
her
i
must
hear
those
words
egidio
you
are
quite
mad
i
repeated
strange
he
said
slowly
you
stake
your
life
on
my
wife
s
innocence
yet
you
refuse
me
the
only
means
of
vindicating
it
i
would
give
my
life
for
any
one
of
you
but
what
you
ask
is
not
mine
to
the
priest
first
the
man
afterward
he
sneered
long
afterward
he
measured
me
with
a
contemptuous
eye
we
laymen
are
ready
to
give
the
last
shred
of
flesh
from
our
bones
but
you
priests
intend
to
keep
your
cassocks
i
tell
you
my
cassock
is
not
mine
i
repeated
and
by
god
he
cried
you
are
right
for
it
s
mine
who
put
it
on
your
back
but
my
father
what
kept
it
there
but
my
charity
peasant
beggar
hear
his
holiness
pontificate
yes
i
said
i
was
a
peasant
and
a
beggar
when
your
father
found
me
and
if
he
had
left
me
one
i
might
have
been
excused
for
putting
my
hand
to
any
ugly
job
that
my
betters
required
of
me
but
he
made
me
a
priest
and
so
set
me
above
all
of
you
and
laid
on
me
the
charge
of
your
souls
as
well
as
he
sat
down
shaken
with
dreadful
tears
ah
he
broke
out
would
you
have
answered
me
thus
when
we
were
boys
together
and
i
stood
between
you
and
andrea
if
god
had
given
me
the
you
call
it
strength
to
make
a
woman
s
soul
your
to
heaven
her
soul
is
in
my
care
not
yours
my
son
she
is
safe
with
she
but
i
i
go
out
to
meet
death
and
leave
a
worse
death
behind
me
he
leaned
over
and
clutched
my
arm
it
is
not
for
myself
i
plead
but
for
her
for
her
egidio
don
t
you
see
to
what
a
hell
you
condemn
her
if
i
don
t
come
back
what
chance
has
she
against
that
slow
unsleeping
hate
their
lies
will
fasten
themselves
to
her
and
suck
out
her
life
you
and
marianna
are
powerless
against
such
you
leave
her
in
god
s
hands
my
easily
said
but
ah
priest
if
you
were
a
man
what
if
their
poison
works
in
me
and
i
go
to
battle
thinking
that
every
austrian
bullet
may
be
sent
by
her
lover
s
hand
what
if
i
die
not
only
to
free
italy
but
to
free
my
wife
as
well
i
laid
my
hand
on
his
shoulder
my
son
i
answer
for
her
leave
your
faith
in
her
in
my
hands
and
i
will
keep
it
he
stared
at
me
strangely
and
what
if
your
own
fail
you
in
her
never
i
call
every
saint
to
witness
and
yet
and
yet
ah
this
is
a
blind
he
shouted
you
know
all
and
perjure
yourself
to
spare
me
at
that
my
son
i
felt
a
knife
in
my
breast
i
looked
at
him
in
anguish
and
his
gaze
was
a
wall
of
metal
mine
seemed
to
slip
away
from
it
like
a
clawless
thing
struggling
up
the
sheer
side
of
a
precipice
you
know
all
he
repeated
and
you
dare
not
let
me
hear
her
i
dare
not
betray
my
he
waved
the
answer
aside
is
this
a
time
to
quibble
over
church
discipline
if
you
believed
in
her
you
would
save
her
at
any
cost
i
said
to
myself
eternity
can
hold
nothing
worse
than
this
for
me
and
clutched
my
resolve
again
like
a
cross
to
my
bosom
just
then
there
was
a
hand
on
the
door
and
we
heard
donna
marianna
faustina
has
sent
to
know
if
the
is
he
is
here
bid
her
come
down
to
the
roberto
spoke
quietly
and
closed
the
door
on
her
so
that
she
should
not
see
his
face
we
heard
her
patter
away
across
the
brick
floor
of
the
roberto
turned
to
me
egidio
he
said
and
all
at
once
i
was
no
more
than
a
straw
on
the
torrent
of
his
will
the
chapel
adjoined
the
room
in
which
we
sat
he
opened
the
door
and
in
the
twilight
i
saw
the
light
glimmering
before
the
virgin
s
shrine
and
the
old
carved
confessional
standing
like
a
cowled
watcher
in
its
corner
but
i
saw
it
all
in
a
dream
for
nothing
in
heaven
or
earth
was
real
to
me
but
the
iron
grip
on
my
shoulder
quick
he
said
and
drove
me
forward
i
heard
him
shoot
back
the
bolt
of
the
outer
door
and
a
moment
later
i
stood
alone
in
the
garden
the
sun
had
set
and
the
cold
spring
dusk
was
falling
lights
shone
here
and
there
in
the
long
front
of
the
villa
the
statues
glimmered
gray
among
the
thickets
through
the
of
the
chapel
i
caught
the
faint
red
gleam
of
the
virgin
s
lamp
but
i
turned
my
back
on
it
and
walked
away
all
night
i
lay
like
a
heretic
on
the
fire
before
dawn
there
came
a
call
from
the
villa
the
count
had
received
a
second
summons
from
milan
and
was
to
set
out
in
an
hour
i
hurried
down
the
cold
dewy
path
to
the
lake
all
was
new
and
hushed
and
strange
as
on
the
day
of
resurrection
and
in
the
dark
twilight
of
the
garden
alleys
the
statues
stared
at
me
like
the
shrouded
dead
in
the
where
the
old
count
s
portrait
hung
i
found
the
family
assembled
andrea
and
gemma
sat
together
a
little
pinched
i
thought
but
decent
and
like
mourners
who
expect
to
inherit
donna
marianna
drooped
near
them
with
something
black
over
her
head
and
her
face
dim
with
weeping
roberto
received
me
calmly
and
then
turned
to
his
sister
go
fetch
my
wife
he
said
while
she
was
gone
there
was
silence
we
could
hear
the
cold
drip
of
the
and
the
patter
of
rats
in
the
wall
andrea
and
his
wife
stared
out
of
window
and
roberto
sat
in
his
father
s
carved
seat
at
the
head
of
the
long
table
then
the
door
opened
and
faustina
entered
when
i
saw
her
i
stopped
breathing
she
seemed
no
more
than
the
shell
of
herself
a
hollow
thing
that
grief
has
voided
her
eyes
returned
our
images
like
polished
agate
but
conveyed
to
her
no
sense
of
our
presence
marianna
led
her
to
a
seat
and
she
crossed
her
hands
and
nailed
her
dull
gaze
on
roberto
i
looked
from
one
to
another
and
in
that
spectral
light
it
seemed
to
me
that
we
were
all
souls
come
to
judgment
and
naked
to
each
other
as
to
god
as
to
my
own
wrongdoing
it
weighed
on
me
no
more
than
dust
the
only
feeling
i
had
room
for
was
fear
a
fear
that
seemed
to
fill
my
throat
and
lungs
and
bubble
coldly
over
my
drowning
head
suddenly
roberto
began
to
speak
his
voice
was
clear
and
steady
and
i
clutched
at
his
words
to
drag
myself
above
the
surface
of
my
terror
he
touched
on
the
charge
that
had
been
made
against
his
wife
he
did
not
say
by
whom
the
foul
rumor
that
had
made
itself
heard
on
the
eve
of
their
first
parting
duty
he
said
had
sent
him
a
double
summons
to
fight
for
his
country
and
for
his
wife
he
must
clear
his
wife
s
name
before
he
was
worthy
to
draw
sword
for
italy
there
was
no
time
to
tame
the
slander
before
throttling
it
he
had
to
take
the
shortest
way
to
its
throat
at
this
point
he
looked
at
me
and
my
soul
shook
then
he
turned
to
andrea
and
gemma
when
you
came
to
me
with
this
rumor
he
said
quietly
you
agreed
to
consider
the
family
honor
satisfied
if
i
could
induce
don
egidio
to
let
me
take
his
place
and
overhear
my
wife
s
confession
and
if
that
confession
convinced
me
of
her
innocence
was
this
the
understanding
andrea
muttered
something
and
gemma
tapped
a
sullen
foot
after
you
had
left
roberto
continued
i
laid
the
case
before
don
egidio
and
threw
myself
on
his
he
looked
at
me
fixedly
so
strong
was
his
faith
in
my
wife
s
innocence
that
for
her
sake
he
agreed
to
violate
the
sanctity
of
the
confessional
i
took
his
marianna
sobbed
and
crossed
herself
and
a
strange
look
flitted
over
faustina
s
face
there
was
a
moment
s
pause
then
roberto
rising
walked
across
the
room
to
his
wife
and
took
her
by
the
hand
your
seat
is
beside
me
countess
siviano
he
said
and
led
her
to
the
empty
chair
by
his
own
gemma
started
to
her
feet
but
her
husband
pulled
her
down
again
jesus
mary
we
heard
donna
marianna
moan
roberto
raised
his
wife
s
hand
to
his
lips
you
forgive
me
he
said
the
means
i
took
to
defend
you
and
turning
to
andrea
he
added
slowly
i
declare
my
wife
innocent
and
my
honor
satisfied
you
swear
to
stand
by
my
decision
what
andrea
stammered
out
what
hissing
serpents
of
speech
gemma
s
clinched
teeth
bit
back
i
never
knew
for
my
eyes
were
on
faustina
and
her
face
was
a
wonder
to
behold
she
had
let
herself
be
led
across
the
room
like
a
blind
woman
and
had
listened
without
change
of
feature
to
her
husband
s
first
words
but
as
he
ceased
her
frozen
gaze
broke
and
her
whole
body
seemed
to
melt
against
his
breast
he
put
his
arm
out
but
she
slipped
to
his
feet
and
marianna
hastened
forward
to
raise
her
up
at
that
moment
we
heard
the
stroke
of
oars
across
the
quiet
water
and
saw
the
count
s
boat
touch
the
four
strong
oarsmen
from
monte
isola
were
to
row
him
down
to
iseo
to
take
horse
for
milan
and
his
servant
knapsack
on
shoulder
knocked
warningly
at
the
terrace
window
no
time
to
lose
excellency
he
cried
roberto
turned
and
gripped
my
hand
pray
for
me
he
said
low
and
with
a
brief
gesture
to
the
others
ran
down
the
terrace
to
the
boat
marianna
was
bathing
faustina
with
happy
tears
look
up
dear
think
how
soon
he
will
come
back
and
there
is
the
sunrise
see
andrea
and
gemma
had
slunk
away
like
ghosts
at
and
a
red
dawn
stood
over
milan
if
that
sun
rose
red
it
set
scarlet
it
was
the
first
of
the
five
days
in
milan
the
five
glorious
days
as
they
are
called
roberto
reached
the
city
just
before
the
gates
closed
so
much
we
knew
little
more
we
heard
of
him
in
the
broletto
whence
he
must
have
escaped
when
the
austrians
blew
in
the
door
and
in
the
casa
vidiserti
with
casati
cattaneo
and
the
rest
but
after
the
barricading
began
we
could
trace
him
only
as
having
been
seen
here
and
there
in
the
thick
of
the
fighting
or
tending
the
wounded
under
bertani
s
orders
his
place
one
would
have
said
was
in
the
with
the
soberer
heads
but
that
was
an
hour
when
every
man
gave
his
blood
where
it
was
most
needed
and
cernuschi
dandolo
anfossi
della
porta
fought
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
students
artisans
and
peasants
certain
it
is
that
he
was
seen
on
the
fifth
day
for
among
the
volunteers
who
swarmed
after
manara
in
his
assault
on
the
porta
tosa
was
a
servant
of
palazzo
siviano
and
this
fellow
swore
he
had
seen
his
master
charge
with
manara
in
the
last
assault
had
watched
him
sword
in
hand
press
close
to
the
gates
and
then
as
they
swung
open
before
the
victorious
dash
of
our
men
had
seen
him
drop
and
disappear
in
the
inrushing
tide
of
peasants
that
almost
swept
the
little
company
off
its
feet
after
that
we
heard
nothing
there
was
savage
work
in
milan
in
those
days
and
more
than
one
figure
lay
lost
among
the
heaps
of
dead
hacked
and
disfeatured
by
croat
blades
at
the
villa
we
waited
breathless
news
came
to
us
hour
by
hour
the
very
wind
seemed
to
carry
it
and
it
was
swept
to
us
on
the
incessant
rush
of
the
rain
on
the
radetsky
had
fled
from
milan
to
face
venice
rising
in
his
path
on
the
the
first
piedmontese
had
crossed
the
ticino
and
charles
albert
himself
was
in
pavia
on
the
the
bells
of
milan
had
carried
the
word
from
turin
to
naples
from
genoa
to
ancona
and
the
whole
country
was
pouring
like
a
into
lombardy
heroes
sprang
up
from
the
bloody
soil
as
thick
as
wheat
after
rain
and
every
day
carried
some
new
name
to
us
but
never
the
one
for
which
we
prayed
and
waited
weeks
passed
we
heard
of
pastrengo
goito
rivoli
of
radetsky
hemmed
into
the
quadrilateral
and
our
troops
closing
in
on
him
from
rome
tuscany
and
venetia
months
passed
and
we
heard
of
custozza
we
saw
charles
albert
s
broken
forces
flung
back
from
the
mincio
to
the
oglio
from
the
oglio
to
the
adda
we
followed
the
dreadful
retreat
from
milan
and
saw
our
rescuers
dispersed
like
dust
before
the
wind
but
all
the
while
no
word
came
to
us
of
roberto
these
were
dark
days
in
lombardy
and
nowhere
darker
than
in
the
old
villa
on
iseo
in
september
donna
marianna
and
the
young
countess
put
on
black
and
count
andrea
and
his
wife
followed
their
example
in
october
the
countess
gave
birth
to
a
daughter
count
andrea
then
took
possession
of
the
palazzo
siviano
and
the
two
women
remained
at
the
villa
i
have
no
heart
to
tell
you
of
the
days
that
followed
donna
marianna
wept
and
prayed
incessantly
and
it
was
long
before
the
baby
could
snatch
a
smile
from
her
as
for
the
countess
faustina
she
went
among
us
like
one
of
the
statues
in
the
garden
the
child
had
a
from
the
village
and
it
was
small
wonder
there
was
no
milk
for
it
in
that
marble
breast
i
spent
much
of
my
time
at
the
villa
comforting
donna
marianna
as
best
i
could
but
sometimes
in
the
long
winter
evenings
when
we
three
sat
in
the
with
the
old
count
s
portrait
overhead
and
i
looked
up
and
saw
the
countess
faustina
in
the
tall
carved
seat
beside
her
husband
s
empty
chair
my
spine
grew
chill
and
i
felt
a
cold
wind
in
my
hair
the
end
of
it
was
that
in
the
spring
i
went
to
see
my
bishop
and
laid
my
sin
before
him
he
was
a
saintly
and
merciful
old
man
and
gave
me
a
patient
hearing
you
believed
the
lady
innocent
he
asked
when
i
had
ended
monsignore
on
my
soul
you
thought
to
avert
a
great
calamity
from
the
house
to
which
you
owed
more
than
your
life
it
was
my
only
he
laid
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
go
home
my
son
you
shall
learn
my
three
months
later
i
was
ordered
to
resign
my
living
and
go
to
america
where
a
priest
was
needed
for
the
italian
mission
church
in
new
york
i
packed
my
possessions
and
set
sail
from
genoa
i
knew
no
more
of
america
than
any
peasant
up
in
the
hills
i
fully
expected
to
be
speared
by
naked
savages
on
landing
and
for
the
first
few
months
after
my
arrival
i
wished
at
least
once
a
day
that
such
a
blessed
fate
had
befallen
me
but
it
is
no
part
of
my
story
to
tell
you
what
i
suffered
in
those
early
days
the
church
had
dealt
with
me
mercifully
as
is
her
wont
and
her
punishment
fell
far
below
my
deserts
i
had
been
some
four
years
in
new
york
and
no
longer
thought
of
looking
back
from
the
plough
when
one
day
word
was
brought
me
that
an
italian
professor
lay
ill
and
had
asked
for
a
priest
there
were
many
italian
refugees
in
new
york
at
that
time
and
the
greater
number
being
men
earned
a
living
by
teaching
their
language
which
was
then
included
among
the
accomplishments
of
fashionable
new
york
the
messenger
led
me
to
a
poor
and
up
to
a
small
bare
room
on
the
top
floor
on
the
nailed
to
the
door
i
read
the
name
de
roberti
professor
of
inside
a
haggard
man
tossed
on
the
narrow
bed
he
turned
a
glazed
eye
on
me
as
i
entered
and
i
recognized
roberto
siviano
i
steadied
myself
against
the
and
stood
staring
at
him
without
a
word
what
s
the
matter
asked
the
doctor
who
was
bending
over
the
bed
i
stammered
that
the
sick
man
was
an
old
friend
he
wouldn
t
know
his
oldest
friend
just
now
said
the
doctor
the
fever
s
on
him
but
it
will
go
down
toward
i
sat
down
at
the
head
of
the
bed
and
took
roberto
s
hand
in
mine
is
he
going
to
die
i
asked
i
don
t
believe
so
but
he
wants
i
will
nurse
the
doctor
nodded
and
went
out
i
sat
in
the
little
room
with
roberto
s
burning
hand
in
mine
gradually
his
skin
cooled
the
fingers
grew
quiet
and
the
flush
faded
from
his
sallow
toward
dusk
he
looked
up
at
me
and
smiled
egidio
he
said
quietly
i
administered
the
sacrament
which
he
received
with
the
most
fervent
devotion
then
he
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
during
the
weeks
that
followed
i
had
no
time
to
ask
myself
the
meaning
of
it
all
my
one
business
was
to
keep
him
alive
if
i
could
i
fought
the
fever
day
and
night
and
at
length
it
yielded
for
the
most
part
he
raved
or
lay
unconscious
but
now
and
then
he
knew
me
for
a
moment
and
whispered
egidio
with
a
look
of
peace
i
had
stolen
many
hours
from
my
duties
to
nurse
him
and
as
soon
as
the
danger
was
past
i
had
to
go
back
to
my
parish
work
then
it
was
that
i
began
to
ask
myself
what
had
brought
him
to
america
but
i
dared
not
face
the
answer
on
the
fourth
day
i
snatched
a
moment
from
my
work
and
climbed
to
his
room
i
found
him
sitting
propped
against
his
pillows
weak
as
a
child
but
and
quiet
i
ran
forward
but
his
look
stopped
me
he
said
the
doctor
tells
me
that
i
owe
my
life
to
your
nursing
and
i
have
to
thank
you
for
the
kindness
you
have
shown
to
a
friendless
a
stranger
i
gasped
he
looked
at
me
steadily
i
am
not
aware
that
we
have
met
before
he
said
for
a
moment
i
thought
the
fever
was
on
him
but
a
second
glance
convinced
me
that
he
was
master
of
himself
roberto
i
cried
trembling
you
have
the
advantage
of
me
he
said
civilly
but
my
name
is
roberti
not
the
floor
swam
under
me
and
i
had
to
lean
against
the
wall
you
are
not
count
roberto
siviano
of
milan
i
am
tommaso
de
roberti
professor
of
italian
from
and
you
have
never
seen
me
before
never
that
i
know
were
you
never
at
siviano
on
the
lake
of
iseo
i
faltered
he
said
calmly
i
am
unacquainted
with
that
part
of
my
heart
grew
cold
and
i
was
silent
you
mistook
me
for
a
friend
i
suppose
he
added
yes
i
cried
i
mistook
you
for
a
friend
and
with
that
i
fell
on
my
knees
by
his
bed
and
cried
like
a
child
suddenly
i
felt
a
touch
on
my
shoulder
egidio
said
he
in
a
broken
voice
look
i
raised
my
eyes
and
there
was
his
old
smile
above
me
and
we
clung
to
each
other
without
a
word
presently
however
he
drew
back
and
put
me
quietly
aside
sit
over
there
egidio
my
bones
are
like
water
and
i
am
not
good
for
much
talking
let
us
wait
roberto
sleep
now
we
can
talk
no
what
i
have
to
say
must
be
said
at
he
examined
me
thoughtfully
you
have
a
parish
here
in
new
york
i
assented
and
my
work
keeps
me
here
i
have
pupils
it
is
too
late
to
make
a
a
change
he
continued
to
look
at
me
calmly
it
would
be
difficult
for
me
he
explained
to
find
employment
in
a
new
but
why
should
you
leave
here
i
shall
have
to
he
returned
deliberately
if
you
persist
in
recognizing
in
me
your
former
friend
count
roberto
he
lifted
his
hand
egidio
he
said
i
am
alone
here
and
without
friends
the
companionship
the
sympathy
of
my
parish
priest
would
be
a
consolation
in
this
strange
city
but
it
must
not
be
the
companionship
of
the
of
siviano
you
understand
roberto
i
cried
it
is
too
dreadful
to
understand
be
a
man
egidio
said
he
with
a
touch
of
impatience
the
choice
lies
with
you
and
you
must
make
it
now
if
you
are
willing
to
ask
no
questions
to
name
no
names
to
make
no
allusions
to
the
past
let
us
live
as
friends
together
in
god
s
name
if
not
as
soon
as
my
legs
can
carry
me
i
must
be
off
again
the
world
is
wide
luckily
but
why
should
we
be
parted
i
was
on
my
knees
at
his
side
in
an
instant
we
must
never
be
parted
i
cried
do
as
you
will
with
me
give
me
your
orders
and
i
obey
have
i
not
always
obeyed
you
i
felt
his
hand
close
sharply
on
mine
egidio
he
admonished
me
no
no
i
shall
remember
i
shall
say
nothing
think
nothing
think
nothing
i
said
with
a
last
effort
god
bless
you
he
answered
my
son
for
eight
years
i
kept
my
word
to
him
we
met
daily
almost
we
ate
and
walked
and
talked
together
we
lived
like
david
and
jonathan
but
without
so
much
as
a
glance
at
the
past
how
he
had
escaped
from
milan
how
he
had
reached
new
york
i
never
knew
we
talked
often
of
italy
s
liberation
as
what
italians
would
not
but
never
touched
on
his
share
in
the
work
once
only
a
word
slipped
from
him
and
that
was
when
one
day
he
asked
me
how
it
was
that
i
had
been
sent
to
america
the
blood
rushed
to
my
face
and
before
i
could
answer
he
had
raised
a
silencing
hand
i
see
he
said
it
was
penance
during
the
first
years
he
had
plenty
of
work
to
do
but
he
lived
so
frugally
that
i
guessed
he
had
some
secret
use
for
his
earnings
it
was
easy
to
conjecture
what
it
was
all
over
the
world
italian
exiles
were
toiling
and
saving
to
further
the
great
cause
he
had
political
friends
in
new
york
and
sometimes
he
went
to
other
cities
to
attend
meetings
and
make
addresses
his
zeal
never
slackened
and
but
for
me
he
would
often
have
gone
hungry
that
some
shivering
patriot
might
dine
i
was
with
him
heart
and
soul
but
i
had
the
parish
on
my
shoulders
and
perhaps
my
long
experience
of
men
had
made
me
a
little
less
credulous
than
christian
charity
requires
for
i
could
have
sworn
that
some
of
the
heroes
who
hung
on
him
had
never
had
a
whiff
of
austrian
blood
and
would
have
fed
out
of
the
same
trough
with
the
if
there
had
been
polenta
enough
to
go
round
happily
my
friend
had
no
such
doubts
he
believed
in
the
patriots
as
devoutly
as
in
the
cause
and
if
some
of
his
dollars
travelled
no
farther
than
the
nearest
or
he
never
suspected
the
course
they
took
his
health
was
never
the
same
after
the
fever
and
by
and
by
he
began
to
lose
his
pupils
and
the
patriots
cooled
off
as
his
pockets
fell
in
toward
the
end
i
took
him
to
live
in
my
shabby
attic
he
had
grown
weak
and
had
a
troublesome
cough
and
he
spent
the
greater
part
of
his
days
indoors
cruel
days
they
must
have
been
to
him
but
he
made
no
sign
and
always
welcomed
me
with
a
cheerful
word
when
his
pupils
dropped
off
and
his
health
made
it
difficult
for
him
to
pick
up
work
outside
he
set
up
a
s
sign
and
used
to
earn
a
few
pennies
by
serving
as
amanuensis
to
my
poor
parishioners
but
it
went
against
him
to
take
their
money
and
half
the
time
he
did
the
work
for
nothing
i
knew
it
was
hard
for
him
to
live
on
charity
as
he
called
it
and
i
used
to
find
what
jobs
i
could
for
him
among
my
friends
the
who
would
send
him
letters
to
copy
accounts
to
make
up
and
what
not
but
we
were
all
poor
together
and
the
master
had
licked
the
platter
before
the
dog
got
it
so
lived
that
just
man
my
son
and
so
after
eight
years
of
exile
he
died
one
day
in
my
arms
god
had
let
him
live
long
enough
to
see
solferino
and
and
was
perhaps
never
more
merciful
than
in
sparing
him
monte
rotondo
and
mentana
but
these
are
things
of
which
it
does
not
become
me
to
speak
the
new
italy
does
not
wear
the
face
of
our
visions
but
it
is
written
that
god
shall
know
his
own
and
it
can
not
be
that
he
shall
misread
the
hearts
of
those
who
dreamed
of
fashioning
her
in
his
image
as
for
my
friend
he
is
at
peace
i
doubt
not
and
his
just
life
and
holy
death
intercede
for
me
who
sinned
for
his
sake
alone
