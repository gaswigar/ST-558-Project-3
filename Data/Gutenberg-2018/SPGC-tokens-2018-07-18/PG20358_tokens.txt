studied

a
moment
gustavo
is
that
for
me
the
fourth
girl
with
gray
eyes
and
hair
was
sitting
at
ease
on
the
balustrade
giuseppe
still
made
a
feint
of
preoccupation
he
had
also
shifted
his
position
so
that
he
might
command
the
profile
of
the
girl
beppo
and
the
donkeys
constance
clasped
her
hands
in
an
ecstasy
of
admiration
constance
ahead
on
fidilini
an
officer
marching
at
each
side
of
her
saddle
she
seated
herself
in
the
deep
embrasure
of
a
window
close
beside
tony
parapet
the
man
bowed
with
a
gesture
which
made
her
free
of
the
book
she
turned
the
pages
and
paused
at
the
week
entries
constance
ripped
the
letter
open
and
read
it
aloud
nannie
caught
sight
of
the
visitors
first
and
came
running
forward
to
meet
them
the
two
mounted
the
steps
of
the
jail
and
jerked
the
bell
never
before
had
he
had
such
overwhelming
reason
to
doubt
his
senses

chapter
i
the
courtyard
of
the
hotel
du
lac
furnished
with
half
a
dozen
tables
and
chairs
a
red
and
green
parrot
chained
to
a
perch
and
a
shady
little
arbor
covered
with
vines
is
a
pleasant
enough
place
for
morning
coffee
but
decidedly
too
sunny
for
afternoon
tea
it
was
close
upon
four
of
a
july
day
when
gustavo
his
inseparable
napkin
floating
from
his
arm
emerged
from
the
cool
dark
doorway
of
the
house
and
scanned
the
burning
vista
of
tables
and
chairs
he
would
never
under
ordinary
circumstances
have
interrupted
his
siesta
for
the
mere
delivery
of
a
letter
but
this
particular
letter
was
addressed
to
the
young
american
man
and
young
american
men
as
every
head
waiter
knows
are
an
unreasonably
impatient
lot
the
was
empty
as
he
might
have
foreseen
and
he
was
turning
with
a
patient
sigh
towards
the
long
arbor
that
led
to
the
lake
when
the
sound
of
a
rustling
paper
in
the
summer
house
deflected
his
course
he
approached
the
doorway
and
looked
inside
the
young
american
man
in
white
flannels
with
a
red
protruding
from
his
pocket
was
comfortably
stretched
in
a
lounging
chair
engaged
with
a
cigarette
and
a
copy
of
the
paris
he
glanced
up
with
a
yawn
excusable
under
the
circumstances
but
as
his
eye
fell
upon
the
letter
he
sprang
to
his
feet
hello
gustavo
is
that
for
me
illustration
gustavo
is
that
for
me
gustavo
bowed
she
is
at
last
arrive
ze
lettair
for
which
you
haf
so
moch
weesh
he
bowed
a
second
time
and
presented
it
meestair
jayreen
ailyar
the
young
man
laughed
i
do
wish
to
hurt
your
feelings
gustavo
but
i
not
sure
i
should
answer
if
my
eyes
were
shut
he
picked
up
the
letter
glanced
at
the
address
to
make
sure
the
name
was
jerymn
hilliard
and
ripped
it
open
with
an
exaggerated
sigh
of
relief
then
he
glanced
up
and
caught
gustavo
expression
gustavo
came
of
a
romantic
race
there
was
a
gleam
of
sympathetic
interest
in
his
eye
oh
you
need
look
so
knowing
i
suppose
you
think
this
is
a
love
letter
well
it
not
it
is
since
you
appear
to
be
interested
a
letter
from
my
sister
informing
me
that
they
will
arrive
tonight
and
that
we
will
pull
out
for
riva
by
the
first
boat
tomorrow
morning
not
that
i
want
to
leave
you
gustavo
but
oh
thunder
he
finished
the
reading
in
a
frowning
silence
while
the
waiter
stood
at
polite
attention
a
shade
of
anxiety
in
his
eye
there
was
usually
anxiety
in
his
eye
when
it
rested
on
jerymn
hilliard
one
could
never
foresee
what
the
young
man
would
call
for
next
yesterday
he
had
rung
the
bell
and
demanded
a
partner
to
play
lawn
tennis
as
if
the
hotel
kept
partners
laid
away
in
drawers
like
so
many
sheets
he
crumpled
up
the
letter
and
stuffed
it
in
his
pocket
i
say
gustavo
what
do
you
think
of
this
they
going
to
stay
in
lucerne
till
the
tenth
that
next
week
and
they
hope
i
do
mind
waiting
it
will
be
nice
for
me
to
have
a
rest
a
man
and
already
spent
three
days
in
valedolmo
signore
you
will
desire
ze
same
room
was
as
much
as
gustavo
thought
ze
same
room
oh
i
suppose
so
he
sank
back
into
his
chair
and
plunged
his
hands
into
his
pockets
with
an
air
of
sombre
resignation
the
waiter
hovered
over
him
divided
between
a
desire
to
return
to
his
siesta
and
a
sympathetic
interest
in
the
young
man
troubles
never
before
in
the
history
of
his
connection
with
the
hotel
du
lac
had
gustavo
experienced
such
a
munificent
companionable
expansive
entertaining
thoroughly
unique
and
inexplicable
guest
even
the
fact
that
he
was
american
scarcely
accounted
for
everything
the
young
man
raised
his
head
and
eyed
his
companion
gloomily
gustavo
have
you
a
sister
a
sister
gustavo
manner
was
uncomprehending
but
patient
signore
i
have
eight
sister
eight

you
manage
to
be

cheerful

but
the
babies
will
grow
up
gustavo
and
as
for
that
betrothed
one
i
should
still
be
a
little
nervous
if
i
were
you
you
can
never
be
sure
they
are
going
to
stay
betrothed
i
hope
she
does
spend
her
time
chasing
over
the
map
of
europe
making
appointments
with
you
to
meet
her
in
unheard
of
little
mountain
villages
where
the
only
approach
to

reading

is
a
paris
four
days
old
and
then
does
turn
up
to
keep
her
appointments

supple
back

another
bow

murmured
and

was
vagueness
in
his
tone

female
relative
who
reads
you
like
an
open
book
who
sees
your
faults
and
skips
your
virtues
who
remembers
how
dear
and
good
and
obliging
your
father
was
at
your
age
who
hoped
great
things
of
you
when
you
were
a
baby
who

intended
to
make

he
held
out
his
hand
gustavo
regarded
it
dazedly
then
since
it
seemed
to
be
expected
he
gingerly
presented
his
own
the
result
was
a
shining
piece
he
pocketed
it
with
a
fresh
succession
of
bows
has
ze

the

see

what
straits
i
am
pushed
for
conversation
if
i
had

and
it
too
much
of
a
strain
to

to
a

all
day
in
dumb
show
he
folded
his
arms
with
a
weary
sigh
a
week
of
valedolmo
an
eternity
gustavo
echoed
the
sigh
though
he
did
not
entirely
comprehend
the
trouble
still
he
was
of
a
generously
sympathetic
nature
it
is
a
pity
he
observed
casually
zat
you
are
not
acquaint
wif
ze
signor
americano
who
lives
in
villa
rosa
he
also
finds
valedolmo
undiverting

he
says
the
young

opened
his
eyes
what

about
a
signor
americano
here

in
zat

jerymn
hilliard
unfolded
his
arms
and
sat
up
alertly
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
had
an
american
family
up
your
sleeve
all
this
time
and
never
said
a
word
about
it
his
tone
was
stern
signore
i

not

zat
you
have
ze
plaisir
of
zer
acquaintance
the
pleasure
of
their
acquaintance
good
heavens
gustavo
when
one
man
meets
another
man
on
a
desert
island
must
they
be
introduced
before
they
can
speak
signore
and
why
may
i
ask
should
an
intelligent
american
family
be
living
in
valedolmo
i
do
not
know
signore
i
have
heard
ze
signor
papa

good
and
ze
doctors
in
americk
zay
say
to
heem
need
change
to
breave
ze
beautiful
climate
of
italia
and
he
say
right
i
go
to
valedolmo
it
is
small
signore
but
ver
oh

in
ze

and
ze

from
all
ze
world
angleesh
french
german
ze
hotel
du
lac
is
full
every
day
we
turn
peoples
away
so
i
seem
to
have
struck
the
wrong
but
about
this
american
family
what
their
name
la
familia
veeldair
from
nuovo
york
veeldair
he
shook
his
head
that
not
american
gustavo
at
least
when
you
say
it
but
never
mind
if
they
come
from
new
york
it
all
right
how
many
are
there
just
two
but
no
ze
papa
and
ze
signorina
and
ze
ze
he
rolled
his
eyes
in
search
of
the
word
ze
aunt
another
aunt
the
sky
appears
to
be
raining
aunts
today
what
does
she
do
for
amusement
the
signorina
who
is
beautiful
as
the
angels
gustavo
spread
out
his
hands
valedolmo
signore
is
on
ze
frontier
it
is
what
you
say
garrison
many
soldiers
many
officers
captains
lieutenants
wif
uniforms
and
swords
zay
take
tea
on
ze
wif
ze
signor
papa
and
ze
signora
aunt
and
most
wif
ze
signorina
costantina
ze
signor
papa
say
he
come
for
his
healf
but
if
you
ask
me
i
sink
maybe
he
come
to
marry
his
daughter
i
see
and
yet
gustavo
american
papas
are
generally
not
so
keen
as
you
might
suppose
about
marrying
their
daughters
to
foreign
captains
and
lieutenants
even
if
they
have
got
uniforms
and
swords
i
should
be
surprised
if
the
signor
papa
were
just
a
little
nervous
over
the
situation
it
seems
to
me
there
might
be
an
opening
for
a
likely
young
fellow
speaking
the
english
language
even
if
he
has
a
uniform
and
sword
how
does
he
strike
you
signore
i
glad
you
agree
with
me
it
is
now
five
minutes
past
four
do
you
think
the
american
family
would
be
taking
a
siesta
i
do
not
know
signore
gustavo
tone
was
still
patient
and
whereabouts
is
the
villa
with
the
terrace
on
the
lake
it
is
a
quarter
of
a
hour
beyond
ze
porta
sant
antonio
if
ze
gate
is
shut
you
ring
at
ze
bell
and
giuseppe
will
open
but
ze
road
is
ver
hot
and
ver
dusty
it
is
more
cooler
to
take
ze
paf
by
ze
lake
straight
to
ze
left
for
ten
minutes
and
step
over
ze
wall
it
is
broken
in
zat
place
and
quite
easy
thank
you
that
is
a
wise
suggestion
i
shall
step
over
the
wall
by
all
means
he
jumped
to
his
feet
and
looked
about
for
his
hat
you
turn
to
the
left
and
straight
ahead
for
ten
minutes
then
till
dinner
i
go
in
search
of
the
signorina
costantina
who
is
beautiful
as
the
angels
in
paradise
and
who
lives
in
a
villa
set
in
a
cypress
grove
on
the
shores
of
lake
garda
not
a
bad
setting
for
romance
is
it
gustavo
dinner
i
believe
is
at
seven
signore
at
seven
and
would
you
like
veal
cooked
milanese
fashion
nothing
would
please
me
more
we
have
only
had
veal
milanese
fashion
five
times
since
i
came
he
waved
his
hand
jauntily
and
strolled
whistling
down
the
arbor
that
led
to
the
lake
gustavo
looked
after
him
and
shook
his
head
then
he
took
out
the
piece
and
rang
it
on
the
table
the
metal
rang
true
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
turned
back
indoors
to
order
the
veal
chapter
ii
the
terrace
of
villa
rosa
juts
out
into
the
lake
bordered
on
three
sides
by
a
stone
parapet
and
shaded
above
by
a
awning
masses
of
oleanders
hang
over
the
wall
and
drop
pink
petals
into
the
blue
waters
below
as
a
study
in
color
the
terrace
is
perfect
but
like
the
of
the
hotel
du
lac
decidedly
too
hot
for
to
the
right
of
the
terrace
however
is
a
shady
garden
set
in
alleys
of
cypress
trees
and
separated
from
the
lake
by
a
strip
of
beach
and
a
low
balustrade
there
could
be
no
better
resting
place
for
a
warm
afternoon
it
was
close
upon
four
five
minutes
past
to
be
accurate
and
the
usual
afternoon
quiet
that
enveloped
the
garden
had
fled
before
the
garrulous
advent
of
four
girls
three
of
them
with
black
eyes
and
blacker
hair
were
kneeling
on
the
beach
thumping
and
scrubbing
a
pile
of
linen
in
spite
of
their
chatter
they
were
working
busily
and
the
grass
beyond
the
was
already
white
with
bleaching
sheets
while
a
lace
trimmed
petticoat
fluttered
from
a
oleander
and
a
row
of
silk
stockings
stretched
the
length
of
the
parapet
the
most
undeductive
observer
would
have
guessed
by
this
time
that
the
pink
villa
visible
through
the
trees
contained
no
such
modern
conveniences
as
stationary
tubs
the
fourth
girl
with
gray
eyes
and
hair
was
sitting
at
ease
on
the
balustrade
fanning
herself
with
a
wide
brimmed
hat
and
dangling
her
feet
clad
in
white
tennis
shoes
over
the
edge
she
wore
a
suit
of
white
linen
cut
sailor
fashion
low
at
the
throat
and
with
sleeves
rolled
to
the
elbows
she
looked
very
cool
and
comfortable
and
free
as
she
talked
with
the
utmost
friendliness
to
the
three
girls
below
her
italian
to
an
unaccustomed
ear
was
exactly
as
glib
as
theirs
the
were
dressed
in
the
gayest
of
peasant
clothes
green
and
scarlet
petticoats
flowered
kerchiefs
coral
beads
and
flashing
earrings
you
would
have
to
go
far
into
the
hills
in
these
degenerate
days
before
meeting
their
match
on
an
italian
highway
but
the
girl
on
the
wall
who
was
actual
if
not
titular
ruler
of
the
domain
of
villa
rosa
possessed
a
keen
eye
for
effect
and
she
plausibly
argued
since
one
must
have
about
why
not
in
the
name
of
all
that
is
beautiful
have
them
in
harmony
with
tradition
and
the
landscape
accordingly
she
designed
and
purchased
their
costumes
herself
there
drifted
presently
into
sight
from
around
the
little
promontory
that
hid
the
village
a
blue
and
white
boat
with
yellow
lateen
sails
she
was
propelled
gondolier
fashion
for
the
wind
was
a
mere
breath
by
a
picturesque
youth
in
a
suit
of
dark
blue
with
white
sash
and
flaring
collar
the
hand
of
the
girl
on
the
wall
was
here
visible
also
illustration
the
fourth
girl
with
gray
eyes
and
hair
was
sitting
at
ease
on
the
balustrade
the
boat
fluttering
in
toward
shore
looked
like
a
giant
butterfly
and
her
name
emblazoned
in
gold
on
her
prow
was
appropriately
the
earlier
in
the
season
with
a
green
hull
and
a
dingy
brown
sail
she
had
been
prosaically
enough
the
but
since
the
advent
of
the
girl
all
this
had
been
changed
the
dropped
her
yellow
wings
with
the
air
of
a
salute
and
lighted
at
the
foot
of
the
under
the
terrace
the
girl
on
the
parapet
leaned
forward
eagerly
did
you
get
any
mail
giuseppe
she
called
signorina
he
scrambled
up
the
steps
and
presented
a
copy
of
the
london
she
received
it
with
a
shrug
clearly
she
felt
little
interest
in
the
london
giuseppe
took
himself
back
to
his
boat
and
commenced
fussing
about
its
fittings
dusting
the
seats
plumping
up
the
cushions
with
an
air
of
absorption
which
deceived
nobody
the
signorina
watched
him
a
moment
with
amused
comprehension
then
she
called
peremptorily
giuseppe
you
know
you
must
spade
the
garden
border
poor
giuseppe
in
spite
of
his
nautical
costume
was
man
of
all
work
he
glanced
dismally
toward
the
garden
border
which
lay
basking
in
the
sunshine
under
the
wall
that
divided
villa
rosa
from
the
rest
of
the
world
it
contained
every
known
flower
which
blossoms
in
july
in
the
kingdom
of
italy
from
camellias
and
hydrangeas
to
heliotrope
and
wall
flowers
its
spading
was
a
complicated
business
and
it
lay
too
far
off
to
permit
of
conversation
giuseppe
was
not
only
a
lazy
but
also
a
social
soul
signorina
he
suggested
would
you
not
like
a
sail
she
shook
her
head
there
is
not
wind
enough
and
it
is
too
hot
and
too
sunny
but
yes
there
a
wind
and
cool
when
you
get
out
on
the
lake
i
will
put
up
the
awning
signorina
the
sun
shall
not
touch
you
she
continued
to
shake
her
head
and
her
eyes
wandered
suggestively
to
the
hydrangeas
but
giuseppe
still
made
a
feint
of
preoccupation
not
being
a
cruel
mistress
she
dropped
the
subject
and
turned
back
to
her
conversation
with
the
they
were
discussing
a
pleasant
topic
for
a
sultry
summer
afternoon
the
probable
content
of
paradise
the
three
girls
were
of
the
opinion
that
it
was
made
up
of
warm
sunshine
and
cool
shade
of
flowers
and
singing
birds
and
sparkling
waters
of
blue
skies
and
mountains
not
unlike
it
will
be
observed
the
very
scene
which
at
the
moment
stretched
before
them
in
so
much
they
were
all
agreed
but
there
were
several
debatable
points
whether
the
stones
were
made
of
gold
and
whether
the
houses
were
not
gold
too
and
that
being
the
case
whether
it
would
not
hurt
your
eyes
to
look
at
them
marietta
declared
blasphemously
as
the
others
thought
that
she
preferred
a
simple
gray
stone
villa
or
at
most
one
of
pink
stucco
to
all
the
golden
edifices
that
paradise
contained
it
was
by
now
fifteen
minutes
past
four
and
a
spectator
had
arrived
though
none
of
the
five
were
aware
of
his
presence
the
spectator
was
standing
on
the
wall
above
the
garden
border
examining
with
appreciation
the
idyllic
scene
below
him
and
with
most
particular
appreciation
the
dainty
person
of
the
girl
on
the
balustrade
he
was
wondering
anxiously
how
he
might
make
his
presence
known
for
no
very
tangible
reason
he
had
suddenly
become
conscious
that
the
matter
would
be
easier
if
he
carried
in
his
pocket
a
letter
of
introduction
the
purlieus
of
villa
rosa
in
no
wise
resembled
a
desert
island
and
in
the
face
of
that
very
fluent
italian
the
suspicion
was
forcing
itself
upon
him
that
after
all
the
mere
fact
of
a
common
country
was
not
a
sufficient
bond
of
union
he
had
definitely
decided
to
withdraw
when
the
matter
was
taken
from
his
hands
illustration
giuseppe
still
made
a
feint
of
preoccupation
the
wall
as
gustavo
had
pointed
out
was
broken
it
was
owing
to
this
fact
that
he
had
been
so
easily
able
to
climb
it
now
as
he
stealthily
turned
preparing
to
in
the
direction
whence
he
had
come
the
loose
stone
beneath
his
foot
slipped
and
he
slipped
with
it
five
startled
pairs
of
eyes
were
turned
in
his
direction
what
they
saw
was
a
young
man
in
flannels
suddenly
throw
up
his
arms
slide
into
an
azalea
bush
from
this
to
the
balustrade
and
finally
land
on
all
fours
on
the
narrow
strip
of
beach
a
shower
of
pink
petals
and
crumbling
masonry
falling
about
him
a
momentary
silence
followed
then
the
making
sure
that
he
was
not
injured
broke
into
a
shrill
chorus
of
laughter
while
the
rocked
under
impact
of
giuseppe
mirth
the
girl
on
the
wall
alone
remained
grave
the
young
man
picked
himself
up
restored
his
guide
book
to
his
pocket
and
blushingly
stepped
forward
hat
in
hand
to
make
an
apology
one
knee
bore
a
splash
of
mud
and
his
tumbled
hair
was
sprinkled
with
azalea
blossoms
i
beg
your
pardon
he
stammered
i
did
mean
to
come
so
suddenly
i
afraid
i
broke
your
wall
the
girl
dismissed
the
matter
with
a
polite
gesture
it
was
already
broken
and
then
she
waited
with
an
air
of
grave
attention
until
he
should
state
his
errand
i
i
came
he
paused
and
glanced
about
vaguely
he
could
not
at
the
moment
think
of
any
adequate
reason
to
account
for
his
coming
yes
her
eyes
studied
him
with
what
appeared
at
once
a
cool
and
an
amused
scrutiny
he
felt
himself
growing
red
beneath
it
can
i
do
anything
for
you
she
prompted
with
the
kind
desire
of
putting
him
at
his
ease
thank
you
he
grasped
at
the
first
idea
that
presented
itself
stopping
at
the
hotel
du
lac
and
gustavo
you
know
told
me
there
was
a
villa
somewhere
around
here
that
belongs
to
prince
someone
or
other
if
you
ring
at
the
gate
and
give
the
gardener
two
francs
and
a
visiting
card
he
will
let
you
walk
around
and
look
at
the
trees
i
see
said
the
girl
and
so
now
you
are
looking
for
the
gate
her
tone
suggested
that
she
suspected
him
of
trying
to
avoid
both
it
and
the
two
francs
prince
villa
is
about
half
a
mile
farther
on
ah
thank
you
he
bowed
a
second
time
and
then
added
out
of
the
desperate
need
of
saying
something
there
a
cedar
of
lebanon
in
it
and
an
india
rubber
plant
from
south
america
indeed
she
continued
to
observe
him
with
polite
interest
though
she
made
no
move
to
carry
on
the
conversation
you
are
an
american
he
asked
at
length
oh
yes
she
agreed
easily
gustavo
knows
that
he
shifted
his
weight
i
am
an
american
too
he
observed
really
the
girl
leaned
forward
and
examined
him
more
closely
an
innocent
candid
wholly
detached
look
in
her
eyes
from
your
appearance
i
should
have
said
you
were
german
most
of
the
foreigners
who
visit
valedolmo
are
german
well
i
not
he
said
shortly
i
american
it
is
a
pity
my
father
is
not
at
home
she
returned
enjoys
meeting
americans
a
gleam
of
anger
replaced
the
embarrassment
in
the
young
man
eyes
he
glanced
about
for
a
dignified
means
of
escape
they
had
him
pretty
well
penned
in
unless
he
wished
to
reclimb
the
wall
and
he
did
not
he
must
go
by
the
terrace
which
retreat
was
cut
off
by
the
or
by
the
parapet
already
occupied
by
the
girl
in
white
and
the
washing
he
turned
abruptly
and
his
elbow
brushed
a
stocking
to
the
ground
he
stooped
to
pick
it
up
and
then
he
blushed
still
a
shade
deeper
this
is
washing
day
observed
the
girl
with
a
note
of
apology
she
rose
to
her
feet
and
stood
on
the
top
of
the
parapet
while
she
beckoned
to
giuseppe
then
she
turned
and
looked
down
upon
the
young
man
with
an
expression
of
frank
amusement
i
hope
you
will
enjoy
the
cedar
of
lebanon
and
the
india
rubber
tree
good
afternoon
she
jumped
to
the
ground
and
crossed
to
the
where
giuseppe
with
a
radiant
smile
was
steadying
the
boat
against
the
landing
she
settled
herself
comfortably
among
the
cushions
and
then
for
a
moment
glanced
back
towards
shore
you
would
better
go
out
by
the
gate
she
called
the
wall
on
the
farther
side
is
harder
to
climb
than
the
one
you
came
in
by
and
besides
it
has
broken
glass
on
the
top
giuseppe
raised
the
yellow
sail
and
the
with
a
graceful
dip
glided
out
to
sea
the
young
man
stood
eyeing
its
progress
revengefully
now
that
the
girl
was
out
of
hearing
a
number
of
pointed
things
occurred
to
him
which
he
might
have
said
his
thoughts
were
interrupted
by
a
fresh
giggle
from
behind
and
he
found
that
the
three
were
laughing
at
him
your
mistress
manners
are
not
the
best
in
the
world
said
he
severely
and
i
am
obliged
to
add
that
yours
are
no
better
they
giggled
again
though
there
was
no
malice
behind
their
humor
it
was
merely
that
they
found
the
lack
of
a
language
in
common
a
circumstance
marietta
with
a
flash
of
black
eyes
murmured
something
very
kindly
in
italian
as
she
shook
out
a
linen
sailor
suit
the
exact
twin
of
the
one
that
had
gone
to
sea
and
spread
it
on
the
wall
to
dry
the
young
man
did
not
linger
for
further
words
setting
his
hat
firmly
on
his
head
he
vaulted
the
parapet
and
strode
off
down
the
cypress
alley
that
stretched
before
him
he
passed
the
pink
villa
without
a
glance
at
the
gate
he
stood
aside
to
admit
a
horse
and
rider
the
horse
was
prancing
in
spite
of
the
heat
the
rider
wore
a
uniform
and
a
shining
sword
there
was
a
clank
of
accoutrements
as
he
passed
and
the
wayfarer
caught
a
gleam
of
piercing
black
eyes
and
a
slight
black
moustache
turned
up
at
the
ends
the
rider
saluted
politely
and
indifferently
and
jangled
on
the
young
man
scowled
after
him
maliciously
until
the
cypresses
hid
him
from
view
then
he
turned
and
took
up
the
dusty
road
back
towards
the
hotel
du
lac
it
was
close
upon
five
and
gustavo
was
in
the
feeding
the
parrot
when
his
eye
fell
upon
the
american
guest
scuffling
down
the
road
in
a
cloud
of
white
dust
gustavo
hastened
to
the
gate
to
welcome
him
back
his
very
eyebrows
expressive
of
his
eagerness
for
news
you
are
returned
signore
the
young
man
paused
and
regarded
him
unemotionally
yes

thanks

remain
longer
signore

gustavo
it
too
infernally
restful
poor
gustavo
saw
a
munificent
shower
of
tips
vanishing
into
nothing
his
face
was
rueful
but
his
manner
was
undiminishingly
polite
signore
sank
you
when

morning
for
the
first

gustavo
bowed
to
the
inevitable
and
the
young
man
passed
on
he
paused
half
way
across
the
what
time
does
the
first
boat
leave
at
half
past
five
signore

chapter
iii
it
was
close
upon
ten
when
jerymn
hilliard
equipped
for
travel
in
proper
blue
serge
appeared
in
the
doorway
of
the
hotel
du
lac
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
discovered
that
he
still
had
twenty
minutes
before
the
omnibus
meeting
the
second
boat
was
due
he
strolled
across
the
paused
for
a
moment
to
tease
the
parrot
and
sauntered
on
to
his
favorite
seat
in
the
summer
house
he
had
barely
established
himself
with
a
cigarette
when
who
should
appear
in
the
gateway
but
miss
constance
wilder
of
villa
rosa
and
a
man
at
a
glance
the
signor
papa
jerymn
hilliard
heart
doubled
its
beat
why
he
asked
himself
excitedly
had
they
come
the
signor
papa
closed
his
green
umbrella
and
having
dropped
into
a
chair
obligingly
near
the
summer
house
took
off
his
hat
and
fanned
himself
he
had
a
tendency
toward
being
stout
and
felt
the
heat
the
girl
meanwhile
crossed
the
court
and
jangled
the
bell
she
waited
two
three
minutes
then
she
pulled
the
rope
again
gustavo
oh
gustavo
the
bell
might
have
been
rung
by
the
fisherman
the
suor
celestina
from
the
convent
asking
her
everlasting
alms
and
gustavo
took
his
time
but
the
voice
was
unmistakable
he
waited
only
to
throw
a
clean
napkin
over
his
arm
before
hurrying
to
answer
signorina
good
morning
signore
it
is
beautiful
but
warm
it
is
warm
he
bowed
and
smiled
and
rubbed
his
hands
together
his
moustaches
fairly
bristling
with
good
will
turned
up
in
a
half
circle
until
they
caressed
his
nose
on
either
side
he
bustled
about
placing
table
and
chairs
and
recklessly
dusting
them
with
the
clean
napkin
the
signorina
laid
her
fluffy
white
parasol
on
one
chair
and
seated
herself
on
another
her
profile
turned
to
the
summer
house
gustavo
hovered
over
them
awaiting
their
pleasure
the
genius
itself
of
respectful
devotion
it
was
constance
who
gave
the
order
she
it
might
be
noticed
gave
most
of
the
orders
that
were
given
in
her
vicinity
she
framed
it
in
english
out
of
deference
to
gustavo
pride
in
his
knowledge
of
the
language
a
glass

the
signore

for
me

to
put
the

last

it
was

you
signorina
he
was
off
across
the
court
his
black
his
white
napkin
streaming
behind
proclaiming
to
all
the
world
that
he
was
engaged
on
the
signorina
americana
bidding
for
persons
of
lesser
note
he
still
preserved
a
measure
of
dignity
the
young
man
in
the
summer
house
had
meanwhile
dropped
his
cigarette
upon
the
floor
and
noiselessly
stepped
on
it
he
had
also
with
the
utmost
caution
lest
the
chair
creak
shifted
his
position
so
that
he
might
command
the
profile
of
the
girl
the
entrance
to
the
summer
house
was
fortunately
on
the
other
side
and
in
all
likelihood
they
would
not
have
occasion
to
look
within
it
was
eavesdropping
of
course
but
he
had
already
been
convicted
of
that
yesterday
and
in
any
case
it
was
not
such
very
bad
eavesdropping
the
of
the
hotel
du
lac
was
public
property
he
had
been
there
first
he
was
there
by
rights
as
a
guest
of
the
house
if
anything
they
were
the
interlopers
besides
nobody
talked
secrets
with
a
head
waiter
his
own
long
conversations
with
gustavo
were
as
open
and
innocent
as
the
day
the
signorina
was
perfectly
welcome
to
listen
to
them
as
much
as
she
chose
she
was
sitting
with
her
chin
in
her
hand
eyeing
the
flying
of
gustavo
a
touch
of
amusement
in
her
face
her
father
was
eyeing
her
severely
constance
it
is
disgraceful
she
laughed
apparently
she
already
knew
or
divined
what
it
was
that
was
disgraceful
but
the
accusation
did
not
appear
to
bother
her
much
wilder
proceeded
grumblingly
it
bad
enough
with
those
five
deluded
officers
but
they
walked
into
the
trap
with
their
eyes
open
and
it
their
own
affair
but
look
at
gustavo
he
can
scarcely
carry
a
dish
without
breaking
it
when
you
are
watching
him
and
giuseppe
that
confounded
with
its
yellow
sails
floats
back
and
forth
in
front
of
the
terrace
till
i
am
on
the
point
of
having
it
scuttled
as
a
public
nuisance
and
those
three
and
the
clerk
and
the
boy
who
brings
milk
and
luigi
and
every
man
woman
and
child
in
the
village
of
valedolmo
and
my
own
dad
as
well
wilder
shook
his
head
illustration
he
had
also
shifted
his
position
so
that
he
might
command
the
profile
of
the
girl
i
came
here
at
your
instigation
for
rest
and
relaxation
to
get
rid
of
nervous
worries
and
here
i
find
a
big
new
worry
waiting
for
me
that
never
thought
of
having
before
what
if
my
only
daughter
should
take
it
in
her
head
to
marry
one
of
these
infernally
italian
officers
constance
reached
over
and
patted
his
arm
do
let
it
bother
you
dad
i
assure
you
i
wo
do
anything
of
the
sort
i
should
think
it
my
duty
to
learn
the
subjunctive
mood
and
that
is
impossible
gustavo
came
hurrying
back
with
a
tray
he
arranged
the
glasses
the
ice
the
sugar
the
cakes
with
loving
elaborate
obsequiousness
the
signorina
examined
the
ice
doubtfully
then
with
approval
it
exactly
right
gustavo
you
got
it
too
large
the
last
time
you
remember
she
stirred
in
some
sugar
and
tasted
it
tentatively
her
head
on
one
side
gustavo
hung
upon
her
expression
in
an
agony
of
apprehension
one
would
have
thought
it
a
matter
for
public
mourning
if
the
lemonade
were
not
mixed
exactly
right
but
apparently
it
was
right
she
nodded
and
smiled
and
gustavo
expression
assumed
relief
constance
broke
open
a
pine
nut
cake
and
settled
herself
for
conversation
have
you
any
guests
gustavo
her
eyes
glanced
over
the
empty
i
am
afraid
the
hotel

interest

signorina

held
his
ground
signorina
zat
yong
american
gentleman
say
it
dam
slow
no
he
just
about
right
gustavo
wilder
broke
in
the
next
time
a
young
american
gentleman
blunders
into
the
hotel
du
lac
you
send
him
around
to
me
signore
gustavo
rolled
his
eyes
toward
the
signorina
she
continued
to
sip
her
lemonade
i
have
told
him
yesterday
an
american
family
live
at
villa
rosa
he
say
right
i
go
call
but
but
i
sink
maybe
you
were
not
at
home
oh
the
signorina
raised
her
head
in
apparent
enlightenment
so
that
was
the
young
man
yes
to
be
sure
he
came
but
he
said
he
was
looking
for
prince
sartorio
villa
i
am
sorry
you
were
away
father
you
would
have
enjoyed
him
his
english
was
did
he
tell
you
he
saw
me
gustavo
signorina
he
tell
me
what
did
he
say
did
he
think
i
was
nice
gustavo
looked
embarrassed
i
i
no
remember
signorina
she
laughed
and
to
his
relief
changed
the
subject
those
english
ladies
who
are
staying
here
what
do
they
look
like
are
they
young
gustavo
delivered
himself
of
an
inimitable
gesture
which
suggested
that
the
english
ladies
had
entered
the
bounds
of
that
indefinite
period
when
the
subject
of
age
must
be
politely
waived
they
are
tall
signorina
and
of
a
thinness
you
would
not
believe
it
possible
i
see
and
so
the
poor
young
man
was
bored
gustavo
bowed
vaguely
he
saw
no
connection
he
was
awfully
she
added
with
a
sigh
i
afraid
i
made
a
mistake
it
would
be
rather
fun
do
you
think
dad
to
have
an
entertaining
young
american
gentleman
about
ump
he
grunted
i
thought
you
were
so
immensely
satisfied
with
the
officers
oh
i
am
she
agreed
with
a
shrug
which
dismissed
forever
the
young
american
gentleman
well
gustavo
she
added
in
a
tone
i
will
tell
you
why
we
called
the
doctor
says
the
signor
papa
is
getting
too
fat
i
think
he
too
fat
do
you
he
seems
to
me
just
comfortably
chubby
but
anyway
the
doctor
says
he
needs
exercise
so
we
going
to
begin
climbing
mountains
with
nails
in
our
shoes
like
the
germans
and
going
to
begin
because
we
got
two
english
people
at
the
villa
who
adore
mountains
do
you
think
you
can
find
us
a
guide
and
some
donkeys
we
want
a
nice
gentle
donkey
for
my
aunt
and
another
for
the
english
lady
and
a
third
to
carry
the
things
and
maybe
me
if
i
get
tired
then
we
want
a
man
who
will
twist
their
tails
and
make
them
go
and
i
am
very
particular
about
the
man
i
want
him
to
be
picturesque
there
no
use
being
in
italy
if
you
ca
have
things
picturesque
is
there
gustavo
signorina
he
bowed
and
resumed
his
attitude
of
strained
attention
he
must
have
curly
hair
and
black
eyes
and
white
teeth
and
a
nice
smile
i
should
like
him
to
wear
a
red
sash
and
earrings
he
must
be
obliging
and
cheerful
and
deferential
and
speak
good
italian
i
wo
have
a
man
who
speaks
only
dialect
he
must
play
the
mandolin
and
sing
santa
lucia
i
believe
that
all
and
i
suppose
since
he
is
to
act
as
guide
he
must
know
the
region
her
father
mildly
suggested
oh
no
that
immaterial
we
can
always
ask
our
way
wilder
grunted
but
offered
no
further
suggestion
we
pay
four
lire
a
day
and
furnish
his
meals
she
added
munificently
and
we
shall
begin
with
the
castle
on
monte
baldo
then
when
we
get
very
proficient
we
climb
monte
maggiore
do
you
understand
ze
signorina
desires
tree
donkeys
and
a
driver
at
seven
morning
to
climb
monte
baldo
in
brief
yes
but
remember
the
earrings
meanwhile
a
commotion
was
going
on
behind
them
the
hotel
omnibus
had
rumbled
into
the
court
yard
a
had
dragged
out
a
leather
trunk
an
english
hat
box
and
a
couple
of
valises
and
dumped
them
on
the
ground
while
he
ran
back
for
the
paste
pot
and
a
pile
of
labels
the
two
the
and
the
boy
who
cleaned
boots
had
drifted
into
the
court
it
was
evident
that
the
american
gentleman
departure
was
imminent
the
luggage
was
labelled
and
hoisted
to
the
roof
of
the
omnibus
they
all
drew
up
in
a
line
with
their
eyes
on
the
door
but
still
the
young
man
did
not
come
gustavo
over
his
shoulder
dispatched
a
waiter
to
hunt
him
up
the
waiter
returned
breathless
the
gentleman
was
nowhere
he
had
searched
the
entire
house
there
was
not
a
trace
gustavo
sent
the
flying
down
the
arbor
to
search
the
garden
he
was
beginning
to
feel
anxious
what
if
the
gentleman
in
a
sudden
fit
of
melancholia
had
thrown
himself
into
the
lake
that
would
indeed
be
an
unfortunate
affair
constance
reassured
him
and
at
the
same
time
she
arose
it
occurred
to
her
suddenly
that
since
the
young
man
was
going
there
was
nothing
to
be
gained
by
waiting
and
he
might
think
she
picked
up
her
parasol
and
started
for
the
gate
but
wilder
hung
back
he
wanted
to
see
the
matter
out
father
said
she
reproachfully
it
embarrassing
enough
for
him
to
fee
all
those
people
without
our
staying
and
watching
him
do
it
i
suppose
it
is
he
acknowledged
regretfully
as
he
resumed
his
hat
and
umbrella
and
palm
leaf
fan
she
paused
for
a
second
in
the
gateway
gustavo
she
called
over
her
shoulder
forget
the
earrings
gustavo
bowed
twice
and
turned
back
with
a
dazed
air
to
direct
the
business
in
hand
the
reappearing
shook
his
head
no
the
gentleman
was
not
to
be
found
in
the
garden
the
omnibus
driver
leaned
from
his
seat
and
swore
di
did
he
think
the
boat
would
wait
all
day
for
the
sake
of
one
passenger
as
it
was
they
were
ten
minutes
late
and
would
have
to
gallop
every
step
of
the
way
the
turmoil
of
ejaculation
and
gesture
was
approaching
a
climax
when
suddenly
who
should
come
sauntering
into
the
midst
of
it
but
the
young
american
man
himself
he
paused
to
light
a
cigarette
then
waved
his
hand
aloft
toward
his
leather
belongings
take
down
gustavo
changed
my
mind
not
going
it
too
hot
gustavo
gasped
but
signore
you
have
paid
for
your
ticket
true
gustavo
but
there
is
no
law
compelling
me
to
use
it
to
tell
the
truth
i
find
that
i
am
fonder
of
valedolmo
than
i
had
supposed
there
is
something
satisfying
about
the
peace
and
tranquility
of
the
place
one
does
realize
it
till
the
moment
of
parting
comes
do
you
think
i
can
obtain
a
room
for
a
well
an
indefinite
period
gustavo
saw
a
dazzling
vista
of
silver
lire
stretching
into
the
future
with
an
gesture
he
placed
the
house
the
lake
the
surrounding
mountains
at
the
disposal
of
the
american
you
shall
have
what
you
wish
signore
at
dis
season
ze
hotel
du
lac
is
not
crowded
and
there
are
half
a
hundred
rooms
at
my
disposal
very
well
i
will
keep
the
one
i
have
which
commands
a
very
attractive
view
of
a
villa
set
in
a
grove
of
cypress
trees
the
others
had
waited
in
a
state
of
suspension
dumbfounded
at
what
was
going
on
but
as
soon
as
the
young
man
dipped
into
his
pocket
and
fished
out
a
handful
of
silver
they
broke
into
smiles
this
at
least
was
intelligible
the
silver
was
distributed
the
luggage
was
hoisted
down
the
omnibus
was
dismissed
the
courtyard
resumed
its
former
quiet
just
the
american
gentleman
gustavo
and
the
parrot
were
left
then
suddenly
a
frightful
suspicion
dawned
upon
gustavo
it
was
more
than
a
suspicion
it
was
an
absolute
certainty
which
in
his
excitement
he
had
overlooked
from
where
had
the
american
gentleman
dropped
not
the
sky
assuredly
and
there
was
no
place
else
possible
unless
the
door
of
the
summer
house
yes
he
had
been
in
the
summer
house
and
not
sleeping
either
an
indefinable
something
about
his
manner
informed
gustavo
that
he
was
privy
to
the
entire
conversation
gustavo
a
picture
of
guilty
remorse
searched
his
memory
for
the
words
he
had
used
why
oh
why
had
he
not
piled
up
adjectives
it
was
the
opportunity
of
a
lifetime
and
he
had
wantonly
thrown
it
away
but
to
his
astonished
relief
the
young
man
appeared
to
be
bearing
no
malice
he
appeared
on
the
contrary
quite
unusually
cheerful
as
he
sauntered
whistling
across
the
court
and
seated
himself
in
the
exact
chair
the
signorina
had
occupied
he
plunged
his
hand
into
his
pocket
suggestively
gustavo
had
been
the
only
one
omitted
in
the
distribution
of
silver
and
drew
forth
a
roll
of
bills
having
selected
five
crisp
notes
he
placed
them
under
the
sugar
bowl
and
watched
his
companion
while
he
blew
three
meditative
rings
of
smoke
gustavo
he
inquired
do
you
suppose
you
could
find
me
some
nice
gentle
donkeys
and
a
red
sash
and
a
pair
of
earrings
gustavo
fascinated
gaze
had
been
fixed
upon
the
sugar
bowl
and
he
had
only
half
caught
the
words
signore
i
no
understand
just
sit
down
gustavo
it
makes
me
nervous
to
see
you
standing
all
the
time
i
ca
be
comfortable
you
know
unless
everybody
else
is
comfortable
now
pay
strict
attention
and
see
if
you
can
grasp
my
meaning
gustavo
dubiously
accepted
the
edge
of
the
indicated
chair
he
wished
to
humor
the
signore
mood
however
incomprehensible
that
mood
might
be
for
half
an
hour
he
listened
with
strained
attention
while
the
gentleman
talked
and
toyed
with
the
sugar
bowl
amazement
misgiving
amusement
daring
flashed
in
succession
across
his
face
in
the
end
he
leaned
forward
with
shining
eyes
he
whispered
after
a
conspiratorial
glance
over
his
shoulder
i
will
do
it
all
you
may
trust
to
me
the
young
man
rose
removed
the
sugar
bowl
and
sauntered
on
toward
the
road
gustavo
pocketed
the
notes
and
gazed
after
him
he
murmured
as
he
set
about
gathering
up
the
glasses
zese
americans
at
the
gate
the
young
man
paused
to
light
another
cigarette
gustavo
he
called
over
his
shoulder
forget
the
earrings
chapter
iv
the
table
was
set
on
the
terrace
breakfast
was
served
and
the
company
was
gathered
breakfast
consisted
of
the
usual
rolls
and
strained
honey
and
since
a
journey
was
to
the
fore
and
something
sustaining
needed
a
egg
apiece
there
were
four
persons
present
though
there
should
have
been
five
the
two
guests
were
an
englishman
and
his
wife
whom
the
chances
of
travel
had
brought

night

valedolmo

them

cross
of
her
life
she
had
always
affirmed
that
her
name
was
not
mary
or
jane
or
rebecca
hazel
does
well
enough
when
one
is
eighteen
and
beautiful
but
when
one
is
fifty
and
no
longer
beautiful
it
is
little
short
of
absurd
but
if
anyone
at
fifty
could
carry
such
a
name
gracefully
it
was
miss
hazel
wilder
her
fifty
years
sat
as
jauntily
as
constance
this
morning
she
was
very
in
her
short
skirt
belted
jacket
and
green
felt
alpine
hat
with
a
feather
in
the
side
no
one
would
mistake
her
for
a
cyclist
or
a
golfer
or
a
motorist
or
anything
in
the
world
but
an
alpine
climber
whatever
miss
hazel
was
or
was
not
she
was
always
across
from
miss
hazel
sat
her
brother
in
knickerbockers
his
alpine
stock
at
his
elbow
and
also
his
fan
since
his
domicile
in
italy
wilder
fan
had
assumed
the
nature
of
a
symbol
he
could
no
more
be
separated
from
it
than
sebastian
from
his
arrows
or
laurence
from
his
gridiron
at
wilder
elbow
was
the
empty
chair
where
constance
should
have
been
she
who
had
insisted
on
six
as
a
proper
breakfast
hour
and
had
grudgingly
consented
to
postpone
it
till
out
of
deference
to
her
elders
her
father
had
finished
his
egg
and
hers
too
before
she
appeared
as
nonchalant
and
smiling
as
if
she
were
out
the
earliest
of
all
i
think
you
might
have
waited
was
her
greeting
from
the
doorway
she
advanced
to
the
table
saluted
in
military
fashion
dropped
a
kiss
on
her
father
bald
spot
and
possessed
herself
of
the
empty
chair
she
too
was
clad
in
costume
in
so
far
as
blouse
and
skirt
and
leather
leggings
went
but
above
her
face
there
fluttered
the
fluffy
white
brim
of
a
ruffled
sun
hat
with
a
bunch
of
pink
rosebuds
set
over
one
ear
i
am
sorry
not
to
wear
my
own
alpine
hat
aunt
hazel
i
look
so
deliciously
german
in
it
but
i
simply
ca
afford
to
burn
all
the
skin
off
my
nose
you
ca
make
us
believe
that
said
her
father
the
reason
is
that
lieutenant
di
ferara
and
captain
coroloni
are
going
with
us
today
and
that
this
hat
is
more
becoming
than
the
other
it
one
reason
constance
agreed
imperturbably
but
as
i
say
i
do
wish
to
burn
the
skin
off
my
nose
because
that
is
unbecoming
too
you
are
ungrateful
dad
she
added
as
she
helped
herself
to
honey
with
a
liberal
hand
i
invited
them
solely
on
your
account
because
you
like
to
hear
them
talk
english
have
the
donkeys
come
the
donkeys
are
at
the
back
door
nibbling
the
buds
off
the
and
the
driver
is
sitting
on
the
kitchen
doorstep
drinking
coffee
and
smiling
over
the
top
of
his
cup
at
elizabetta
there
are
two
of
him
two
i
only
ordered
one
one
is
the
official
driver
and
the
other
is
a
boy
whom
he
has
brought
along
to
do
the
work
constance
eyed
her
father
sharply
there
was
something
at
once
guilty
and
triumphant
about
his
expression
what
is
it
dad
she
inquired
sternly
i
suppose
he
has
not
got
a
sash
and
earrings
on
the
contrary
he
has
really
how
clever
of
gustavo
i
hope
she
added
anxiously
that
he
talks
good
italian
i
do
know
about
his
italian
but
he
talks
uncommonly
good
english
english
there
was
reproach
disgust
disillusionment
in
her
tone
not
really
father
yes
really
and
truly
almost
as
well
as
i
do
he
has
lived
in
new
york
and
he
speaks
english
like
a
dream
real
english
not
the
gustavo
lieutenant
di
ferara
kind
i
can
understand
what
he
says
how
simply
horrible
very
convenient
i
should
say
illustration
beppo
and
the
donkeys
if
there
anything
i
detest
it
an
americanized
italian
and
here
in
valedolmo
of
all
places
where
you
have
a
right
to
demand
something
unique
and
romantic
and
picturesque
and
real
it
too
bad
of
gustavo
i
shall
never
place
any
faith
in
his
judgment
again
you
may
talk
english
to
the
man
if
you
like
i
shall
address
him
in
nothing
but
italian
as
they
rose
from
the
table
she
suggested
pessimistically
let
go
and
look
at
the
donkeys
i
suppose
they
be
horrid
scraggly
little
beasts
they
turned
out
however
to
be
unusually
attractive
as
donkeys
go
and
they
were
innocently
engaged
in
nibbling
not
but
grass
under
the
tutelage
of
a
barefoot
boy
constance
patted
their
shaggy
noses
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
boy
whose
name
was
beppo
and
looked
about
for
the
driver
proper
he
rose
and
bowed
as
she
approached
his
appearance
was
even
more
violently
spectacular
than
she
had
ordered
gustavo
had
given
good
measure
he
wore
a
loose
white
shirt
immaculately
white
with
a
red
silk
handkerchief
knotted
about
his
throat
brown
corduroy
and
a
red
cotton
sash
with
the
hilt
of
a
knife
conspicuously
protruding
his
corduroy
jacket
was
slung
carelessly
across
his
shoulders
his
hat
was
cocked
jauntily
with
a
red
heron
feather
stuck
in
the
band
last
perfect
touch
of
all
in
his
ears
at
his
ears
rather
a
close
examination
revealed
the
thread
two
golden
hoops
flashed
in
the
sunlight
his
skin
was
dark
not
too
dark
just
a
good
healthy
tan
his
brows
level
and
heavy
his
gaze
candor
itself
he
wore
a
tiny
suggestion
of
a
moustache
which
turned
up
at
the
corners
a
suspicious
examination
of
this
might
have
revealed
the
fact
that
it
was
touched
up
with
burnt
cork
there
was
no
doubt
but
that
he
was
a
handsome
fellow
and
his
attire
suggested
that
he
knew
it
constance
clasped
her
hands
in
an
ecstasy
of
admiration
he
perfect
she
cried
where
on
earth
did
gustavo
find
him
did
you
ever
see
anything
so
beautiful
she
appealed
to
the
others
he
looks
like
a
brigand
in
opera
bouffe
illustration
constance
clasped
her
hands
in
an
ecstasy
of
admiration
the
reddened
visibly
and
fumbled
with
his
hat
my
dear
her
father
warned
he
understands
english
she
continued
to
gaze
with
the
open
admiration
one
would
bestow
upon
a
picture
or
a
view
or
a
horse
the
man
flashed
her
a
momentary
glance
from
a
pair
of
searching
gray
eyes
then
dropped
his
gaze
humbly
to
the
ground
he
said
in
glib
italian
constance
studied
him
more
intently
there
was
something
elusively
familiar
about
his
expression
she
was
sure
she
had
seen
him
before
she
replied
in
italian
you
have
lived
in
the
united
states
signorina
what
is
your
name
i
spik
angleesh
he
observed
i
do
care
if
you
do
speak
english
i
prefer
italian
what
is
your
name
she
repeated
the
question
in
italian
signorina
he
ventured
again
an
anxious
look
had
crept
to
his
face
and
he
hastily
turned
away
and
commenced
carrying
parcels
from
the
kitchen
constance
looked
after
him
puzzled
and
suspicious
the
one
insult
which
she
could
not
brook
was
for
an
italian
to
fail
to
understand
her
when
she
talked
italian
as
he
returned
and
knelt
to
tighten
the
strap
of
a
hamper
she
caught
sight
of
the
thread
that
held
his
earring
she
looked
a
second
longer
and
a
sudden
smile
of
illumination
flashed
to
her
face
she
suppressed
it
quickly
and
turned
away
he
seems
rather
slow
about
understanding
she
remarked
to
the
others
but
i
dare
say
he
do
the
poor
fellow
is
embarrassed
apologized
her
father
his
name
is
tony
he
added
even
he
had
understood
that
much
italian
was
there
ever
an
italian
who
had
been
in
america
whose
name
was
not
tony
why
could
he
have
been
angelico
or
felice
or
pasquale
or
something
decently
picturesque
my
dear
miss
hazel
objected
i
think
you
are
hypercritical
the
man
is
scarcely
to
blame
for
his
name
i
suppose
not
she
agreed
though
i
should
have
included
that
in
my
order
further
discussion
was
precluded
by
the
appearance
of
a
which
turned
in
at
the
gate
and
stopped
before
them
two
officers
descended
and
saluted
in
summer
uniforms
of
white
linen
with
gold
and
shining
they
rivalled
the
in
decorativeness
constance
received
them
with
flattering
acclaim
while
she
noted
from
the
corner
of
her
eye
the
effect
upon
tony
he
had
not
counted
upon
this
addition
to
the
party
and
was
as
scowling
as
she
could
have
wished
while
the
officers
were
engaged
in
making
their
bow
to
the
others
constance
casually
reapproached
the
donkeys
tony
feigned
immersion
in
the
business
of
strapping
hampers
he
had
no
wish
to
be
drawn
into
any
italian
but
to
his
relief
she
addressed
him
this
time
in
english
are
these
donkeys
used
to
but
yes
signorina
zay
are
ver
strong
ver
good
zat
donk
signorina
he
go
all
day
and
never
one
little
stumble
his
english
she
noted
with
amused
appreciation
was
an
exact
copy
of
gustavo
he
had
learned
his
lesson
well
but
she
allowed
not
the
slightest
recognition
of
the
fact
to
appear
in
her
face
and
what
are
their
names
she
inquired
dis
is
fidilini
signorina
and
zat
one
wif
ze
white
nose
is
macaroni
and
zat
ovver
is
cristoforo
colombo
elizabetta
appeared
in
the
doorway
with
two
flasks
and
tony
hurried
forward
to
receive
them
there
was
a
complaisant
set
to
his
shoulders
as
he
strode
off
constance
noted
delightedly
he
was
felicitating
himself
upon
the
ease
with
which
he
had
fooled
her
well
she
would
give
him
cause
before
the
day
was
over
for
other
than
felicitations
she
stifled
a
laugh
of
prophetic
triumph
and
sauntered
over
to
beppo
when
tony
is
engaged
as
a
guide
do
you
always
go
with
him
not
always
signorina
but
carlo
has
wished
me
to
go
to
look
after
the
donkeys
and
who
is
carlo
he
is
the
guide
who
owns
them
beppo
looked
momentarily
guilty
the
answer
had
slipped
out
before
he
thought
oh
indeed
but
if
tony
is
a
guide
why
does
he
have
donkeys
of
his
own
he
used
to
but
one
unfortunately
fell
into
the
lake
and
got
drowned
and
the
other
died
of
a
sickness
he
put
forth
this
preposterous
statement
with
a
glance
as
grave
and
innocent
as
that
of
a
little
cherub
is
tony
a
good
guide
but
yes
of
the
best
there
was
growing
anxiety
in
beppo
tone
he
divined
suspicion
behind
these
persistent
inquiries
and
he
knew
that
in
case
tony
were
dismissed
his
own
munificent
pay
would
stop
do
you
understand
any
english
she
suddenly
asked
he
modestly
repudiated
any
great
knowledge
a
word
here
a
word
there
i
learn
it
in
school
i
see
she
paused
for
a
moment
and
then
inquired
casually
have
you
known
tony
long
signorina
how
long
beppo
considered
someone
clearly
must
vouch
for
the
respectability
this
was
not
in
the
lesson
that
had
been
taught
him
but
he
determined
to
branch
out
for
himself
he
is
my
father
signorina
really
he
looks
young
to
be
your
father
have
you
any
brothers
and
sisters
beppo
i
have
four
brothers
signorina
and
five
sisters
he
fell
back
upon
the
truth
with
relief
the
signorina
smiled
upon
him
a
smile
of
such
heavenly
sweetness
that
he
instantly
joined
the
already
crowded
ranks
of
her
admirers
she
drew
from
her
pocket
a
handful
of
coppers
and
dropped
them
into
his
grimy
little
palm
here
beppo
are
some
soldi
for
the
brothers
and
sisters
i
hope
that
you
will
be
good
and
obedient
and
tell
me
the
truth
chapter
v
after
some
delay
owing
to
tony
inability
to
balance
the
on
cristoforo
colombo
back
they
filed
from
the
gateway
an
imposing
cavalcade
the
ladies
were
on
foot
loftily
oblivious
to
the
fact
that
three
empty
saddles
awaited
their
pleasure
constance
a
gesticulating
officer
at
either
hand
was
vivaciously
talking
italian
while
tony
trudging
behind
listened
with
a
somber
light
in
his
eye
she
now
and
then
cast
a
casual
glance
over
her
shoulder
and
as
she
caught
sight
of
his
gloomy
face
the
animation
of
her
italian
redoubled
the
situation
held
for
her
soul
possibilities
and
though
she
ostensibly
occupied
herself
with
the
officers
she
by
no
means
neglected
the
during
the
first
few
miles
of
the
journey
he
earned
his
four
francs
twice
he
reshifted
the
pack
because
constance
thought
it
insecure
it
was
a
disgracefully
unprofessional
pack
most
guides
would
have
blushed
at
the
making
of
it
once
he
retraced
their
path
some
two
hundred
yards
in
search
of
a
veil
she
thought
she
had
dropped
it
turned
out
that
she
had
had
it
in
her
pocket
all
of
the
time
he
chased
fidilini
over
half
the
mountainside
while
the
others
were
resting
and
he
carried
the
for
a
couple
of
miles
because
it
refused
to
adjust
itself
nicely
to
the
pack
the
morning
ended
by
his
being
left
behind
with
a
balking
donkey
while
the
others
completed
the
last
ascent
that
led
to
their
for
lunch
it
was
a
small
plateau
shaded
by
oak
trees
with
a
broad
view
below
them
and
a
mountain
stream
foaming
down
from
the
rocks
above
it
was
owing
to
beppo
knowledge
of
the
mountain
paths
rather
than
tony
which
had
guided
them
to
this
agreeable
spot
though
no
one
in
the
party
except
constance
appeared
to
have
noted
the
fact
tony
arrived
some
ten
minutes
after
the
others
hot
but
victorious
driving
cristoforo
colombo
before
him
constance
welcomed
his
return
with
an
nod
and
set
him
about
preparing
lunch
he
and
beppo
served
it
and
repacked
the
hampers
entirely
ignored
by
the
others
of
the
party
poor
tony
was
beginning
to
realize
that
a
lives
on
a
desert
island
in
so
far
as
any
companionship
goes
but
his
moment
was
coming
as
they
were
about
to
start
on
constance
spied
high
above
their
heads
where
the
stream
burst
from
the
rocks
a
clump
of
starry
white
blossoms
edelweiss
she
cried
oh
i
must
have
it
it
the
first
i
ever
saw
growing
i
had
supposed
we
were
high
enough
she
glanced
at
the
officers
the
ascent
was
not
dangerous
but
it
was
undeniably
muddy
and
they
both
wore
white
with
very
good
cause
they
hesitated
and
while
they
hesitated
the
opportunity
was
lost
tony
sprang
forward
scrambled
up
the
precipice
hand
over
hand
swung
out
across
the
stream
by
the
aid
of
an
overhanging
branch
and
secured
the
flowers
it
was
very
gracefully
and
easily
done
and
a
burst
of
applause
greeted
his
descent
he
divided
his
flowers
into
two
equal
parts
and
sweeping
off
his
hat
presented
them
with
a
bow
not
to
constance
but
to
the
officers
who
somewhat
sulkily
passed
them
on
she
received
them
with
a
smile
for
an
instant
her
eyes
met
tony
and
he
fell
back
rewarded
the
captain
and
lieutenant
for
the
first
time
regarded
the
and
they
regarded
him
narrowly
red
sash
earrings
stiletto
and
all
constance
caught
the
look
and
laughed
is
he
picturesque
she
inquired
in
italian
the
at
the
hotel
du
lac
found
him
for
me
he
has
been
in
the
united
states
and
speaks
english
which
is
a
great
convenience
the
two
said
nothing
but
they
looked
at
each
other
and
shrugged
the
donkeys
were
requisitioned
for
the
rest
of
the
journey
while
tony
led
miss
hazel
mount
he
could
watch
constance
ahead
on
fidilini
an
officer
marching
at
each
side
of
her
saddle
she
appeared
to
divide
her
favors
with
nice
discrimination
it
was
not
her
fault
if
the
two
were
jealous
of
one
another
tony
could
draw
from
that
obvious
fact
what
consolation
there
was
in
it
illustration
constance
ahead
on
fidilini
an
officer
marching
at
each
side
of
her
saddle
the
ruined
fortress
their
destination
was
now
exactly
above
their
heads
the
last
ascent
boldly
skirted
the
shoulder
of
the
mountain
and
then
doubled
upward
in
a
series
of
serpentine
coils
below
them
the
whole
of
lake
garda
was
spread
like
a
map
wilder
and
the
englishman
having
paused
at
the
edge
of
the
declivity
were
endeavoring
to
trace
the
boundary
line
of
austria
and
they
called
upon
the
officers
for
help
the
two
relinquished
their
post
at
constance
side
while
the
donkeys
kept
on
past
them
up
the
hill
the
winding
path
was
both
stony
and
steep
and
from
a
donkey
standpoint
thoroughly
objectionable
fidilini
was
well
in
the
lead
trotting
sedately
when
suddenly
without
the
slightest
warning
he
chose
to
revolt
whether
constance
pulled
the
wrong
rein
or
whether
as
she
affirmed
it
was
merely
his
natural
badness
in
any
case
he
suddenly
veered
from
the
path
and
took
a
cross
cut
down
the
rocky
slope
below
them
donkeys
are
fortunately
beasts
otherwise
the
two
would
have
plunged
together
down
the
sheer
face
of
the
mountain
as
it
was
it
looked
ghastly
enough
to
the
four
men
below
they
shouted
to
constance
to
stick
on
and
commenced
scrambling
up
the
slope
with
absolutely
no
hope
of
reaching
her
it
was
tony
chance
a
second
time
to
show
his
agility
and
this
time
to
some
purpose
he
was
a
dozen
yards
behind
and
much
lower
down
which
gave
him
a
start
leaping
forward
he
dropped
over
the
precipice
a
fall
of
ten
feet
to
a
narrow
ledge
below
running
toward
them
at
an
angle
he
succeeded
in
cutting
off
their
flight
before
the
frightened
donkey
could
swerve
tony
had
seized
him
by
the
tail
and
had
braced
himself
against
a
boulder
it
was
not
a
dignified
rescue
but
at
least
it
was
effective
fidilini
came
to
a
halt
constance
not
expecting
the
sudden
jolt
toppled
over
sidewise
and
tony
being
equally
unprepared
to
receive
her
the
two
went
down
together
rolling
over
and
over
on
the
grassy
slope
my
dear
are
you
hurt
wilder
quite
pale
with
anxiety
came
scrambling
to
her
side
constance
sat
up
and
laughed
hysterically
while
she
examined
a
bleeding
elbow
n
no
not
dangerously
but
i
think
perhaps
tony
is
tony
however
was
at
least
able
to
run
as
he
was
again
on
his
feet
and
after
the
donkey
captain
coroloni
and
her
father
helped
constance
to
her
feet
while
lieutenant
di
ferara
recovered
a
and
the
white
sun
hat
they
all
climbed
down
together
to
the
path
below
none
the
worse
for
the
averted
tragedy
tony
rejoined
them
somewhat
short
of
breath
but
leading
a
humbled
fidilini
constance
beyond
a
brief
glance
said
nothing
but
her
father
to
the
poor
man
intense
embarrassment
shook
him
warmly
by
the
hand
with
the
repeated
assurance
that
his
bravery
should
not
go
unrewarded
they
completed
their
journey
on
foot
tony
following
behind
quite
conscious
that
if
he
had
played
the
part
of
hero
he
had
done
it
with
a
lamentable
lack
of
grace
chapter
vi
tony
was
stretched
on
the
parapet
that
bordered
the
platform
of
the
fortress
above
him
the
crumbling
tower
rose
many
feet
higher
below
him
a
marvelous
view
stretched
invitingly
but
tony
had
eyes
neither
for
medieval
architecture
nor
picturesque
scenery
he
lay
with
his
coat
doubled
under
his
head
for
a
pillow
in
a
frowning
contemplation
of
the
cracked
stone
pavement
the
four
other
men
after
an
hour
or
so
of
easy
lounging
under
the
pines
at
the
base
of
the
tower
had
organized
a
fresh
expedition
to
the
summit
a
mile
farther
up
wilder
since
morning
had
developed
into
an
enthusiastic
regret
might
come
with
the
morrow
but
as
yet
ambition
still
burned
high
the
remainder
of
the
party
were
less
energetic
the
three
ladies
were
resting
on
rugs
spread
under
the
pines
beppo
was
sleeping
in
the
sun
his
hat
over
his
face
and
the
donkeys
securely
tethered
tony
had
attended
to
that
were
innocently
nibbling
mountain
herbs
there
was
no
obvious
reason
why
as
he
lighted
a
cigarette
and
stretched
himself
on
the
parapet
tony
should
not
have
been
the
most
guide
in
the
world
he
had
not
only
completed
the
expedition
in
safety
but
had
saved
the
heroine
life
by
the
way
and
even
if
the
heroine
did
not
appear
as
thankful
as
she
might
still
her
father
had
shown
due
gratitude
and
what
was
to
the
point
had
promised
a
reward
that
should
have
been
enough
for
any
reasonable
but
it
was
distinctly
not
enough
for
tony
he
was
in
a
fine
temper
as
he
lay
on
the
parapet
and
scowled
at
the
pavement
nothing
was
turning
out
as
he
had
planned
he
had
not
counted
on
the
officers
or
her
predilection
for
italian
he
had
not
counted
on
chasing
donkeys
in
person
while
she
stood
and
looked
on
beppo
was
to
have
attended
to
that
he
had
not
counted
on
anything
quite
so
absurd
as
his
heroic
capture
of
fidilini
since
she
must
let
the
donkey
run
away
with
her
why
in
the
name
of
all
that
was
romantic
could
it
not
have
occurred
by
moonlight
why
when
he
caught
the
beast
could
it
not
have
been
by
the
bridle
instead
of
the
tail
and
above
all
why
could
she
not
have
fallen
into
his
arms
instead
of
on
top
of
him
the
stage
scenery
was
set
for
romance
but
from
the
moment
the
curtain
rose
the
play
had
persisted
in
being
farce
however
farce
or
romance
it
was
all
one
to
him
so
long
as
he
could
play
what
he
objected
to
was
the
minor
part
the
fact
was
clear
that
sash
and
earrings
could
never
compete
with
uniform
and
sword
and
the
italian
language
his
mind
was
made
up
he
would
withdraw
tonight
before
he
was
found
out
and
leave
valedolmo
tomorrow
morning
by
the
early
boat
miss
constance
wilder
should
never
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
the
truth
he
was
engaged
in
framing
a
dignified
speech
to
wilder
thanking
him
for
his
generosity
but
declining
to
accept
a
reward
for
what
had
been
merely
a
matter
of
duty
when
his
reflections
were
cut
short
by
the
sound
of
footsteps
on
the
stairs
they
were
by
no
means
noiseless
footsteps
there
were
good
strong
nails
all
over
the
bottom
of
constance
shoes
the
next
moment
she
appeared
in
the
doorway
her
eyes
were
centered
on
the
view
she
looked
entirely
over
tony
it
was
not
until
he
rose
to
his
feet
that
she
realized
his
presence
with
a
start
dear
me
is
that
you
tony
you
frightened
me
do
get
up
i
know
you
must
be
tired
this
with
a
sweetly
solicitous
smile
tony
smiled
too
and
resumed
his
seat
it
was
the
first
time
since
morning
that
she
had
condescended
to
consider
his
feelings
she
sauntered
over
to
the
opposite
side
and
stood
with
her
back
to
him
examining
the
view
tony
turned
his
back
and
affected
to
be
engaged
with
the
view
in
the
other
direction
he
too
could
play
at
indifference
constance
finished
with
her
view
first
and
crossing
over
she
seated
herself
in
the
deep
embrasure
of
a
window
close
beside
tony
parapet
he
rose
again
at
her
approach
but
there
was
no
eagerness
in
the
motion
it
was
merely
the
necessary
deference
of
a
toward
his
employer
oh
sit
down
she
insisted
i
want
to
talk
to
you
illustration
she
seated
herself
in
the
deep
embrasure
of
a
window
close
beside
tony
parapet
he
opened
his
eyes
with
a
show
of
surprise
his
hurt
feelings
insisted
that
all
the
advances
should
be
on
her
part
constance
seemed
in
no
hurry
to
begin
she
removed
her
hat
pushed
back
her
hair
and
sat
playing
with
the
bunch
of
edelweiss
which
was
stuck
in
among
the
roses
flattening
the
petals
rearranging
the
flowers
with
careful
fingers
a
touch
it
seemed
to
tony
suddenly
clamoring
senses
that
was
almost
a
caress
then
she
looked
up
quickly
and
caught
his
gaze
she
leaned
forward
with
a
laugh
tony
she
said
do
you
spik
any
language
besides
angleesh
he
triumphantly
concealed
all
sign
of
emotion
signorina
i
spik
my
own
language
would
you
mind
my
asking
what
that
language
is
he
indulged
in
a
moment
deliberation
italian
was
clearly
out
of
the
question
and
french
she
doubtless
knew
better
than
he
he
deplored
this
polyglot
education
girls
were
receiving
nowadays
he
had
it
he
would
be
hungarian
his
sole
fellow
guest
in
the
hotel
at
verona
the
week
before
had
been
a
hungarian
nobleman
who
had
informed
him
that
the
magyar
language
was
one
of
the
most
difficult
on
the
face
of
the
globe
there
was
at
least
little
likelihood
that
she
was
acquainted
with
that
my
own
language
signorina
is
magyar
magyar
she
was
clearly
taken
by
surprise
signorina
i
am
hungarian
i
was
born
in
budapest
he
met
her
eyes
with
a
look
of
innocent
candor
really
she
beamed
upon
him
delightedly
he
was
playing
up
even
better
than
she
had
hoped
but
if
you
are
hungarian
what
are
you
doing
here
in
italy
and
how
does
it
happen
that
your
name
is
antonio
my
movver
was
italian
she
name
me
antonio
after
ze
blessed
saint
anthony
of
padua
if
you
lose
anysing
signorina
and
you
say
a
prayer
to
saint
anthony
every
day
for
nine
days
on
ze
morning
of
ze
tenth
you
will
find
it
again
that
is
very
interesting
she
said
politely
how
do
you
come
to
know
english
so
well
tony
we
go
live
in
amerik
when
i
boy
and
you
never
learned
italian
i
should
think
your
mother
would
have
taught
it
to
you
he
imitated
beppo
gesture
a
word
here
a
word
there
we
spik
magyar
at
home
talk
a
little
magyar
tony
i
should
like
to
hear
it
what
shall
i
say
signorina
oh
say
anything
you
please
he
affected
to
hesitate
while
he
rehearsed
the
scraps
of
language
at
his
command
latin
french
german
none
of
them
any
good
but
thank
goodness
he
had
elected
in
college
and
thank
goodness
again
the
professor
had
made
them
learn
passages
by
heart
he
glanced
up
with
an
air
of
flattered
diffidence
and
rendered
in
a
conversational
inflection
an
excerpt
from
the
bible
gesceafta
heofonas
and
englas
sunnan
and
monan
steorran
and
eorthan
hè
gesceop
and
geworhte
on
six
it
is
a
very
beautiful
language
say
some
more
he
replied
with
glib
promptness
with
a
passage
from
beowulf
dygel
lond
warigeath
wulfhleothu
windige
what
does
that
mean
tony
looked
embarrassed
i
do
believe
you
know
it
means
signorina
i
no
like
to
say
you
do
know
it
means
you
make
me
say
signorina
sink
you
ver
beautiful
like
ze
angels
in
paradise
indeed
a
tony
should
not
say
anything
like
that
but
it
is
true
the
more
reason
you
should
not
say
it
you
asked
me
signorina
i
could
not
tell
you
a
lie
the
signorina
smiled
slightly
and
looked
away
at
the
view
tony
seized
the
opportunity
to
look
sidewise
at
her
she
turned
back
and
caught
him
he
dropped
his
eyes
humbly
to
the
floor
does
beppo
speak
magyar
she
inquired
beppo
there
was
wonder
in
his
tone
at
the
turn
her
questions
were
taking
i
sink
not
signorina
that
must
be
very
inconvenient
why
do
you
teach
it
to
him
signorina
he
was
plainly
nonplussed
yes
he
says
that
you
are
his
father
and
i
should
think
his
father
tony
appeared
momentarily
startled
then
he
laughed
he
did
not
mean
his
real
father
he
mean
how
you
say
his
i
give
to
him
his
name
when
he
get
christened
oh
i
see
her
next
question
was
also
a
surprise
tony
she
inquired
with
startling
suddenness
why
do
you
wear
earrings
he
reddened
slightly
because
because
der

girl

h
said
constance
ruminatingly
where
does
this
girl
live
tony
in
valedolmo
signorina
what
does
she
look
like
she
look
like
his
eyes
searched
the
landscape
and
came
back
to
her
face
oh
ver
beautiful
signorina
she
have
hair
brown
and
gold
and
eyes
yes
eyes
zay
are
sometimes
black
signorina
and
sometimes
gray
her
laugh
it
sounds
like
the
song
of
a
nightingale
he
clasped
his
hands
and
rolled
his
eyes
in
a
fine
imitation
of
gustavo
she
is
beautiful
signorina
beautiful
as
ze
angels
in
paradise
there
seem
to
be
a
good
many
people
beautiful
as
the
angels
in
paradise

is
most
beautiful
of
all
what
is
her
name
costantina
he
said
it
softly
his
eyes
on
her
face
ah
constance
rose
and
turned
away
with
a
shrug
her
manner
suggested
that
he
had
gone
too
far
she
wash
clothes
at
ze
hotel
du
lac
he
called
after
her
constance
paused
and
glanced
over
her
shoulder
with
a
laugh
tony
she
said
the
quality
which
i
admire
most
in
a
besides
truthfulness
and
picturesqueness
is
imagination
chapter
vii
on
the
homeward
journey
tony
again
trudged
behind
while
the
officers
held
their
post
at
constance
side
but
tony
spirits
were
still
singing
from
the
little
encounter
on
the
castle
platform
and
in
spite
of
the
animated
italian
which
floated
back
he
was
determined
to
look
at
the
sunny
side
of
the
adventure
it
was
wilder
who
unconsciously
supplied
him
with
a
second
opportunity
for
conversation
he
and
the
englishman
being
deep
in
a
discussion
involving
statistics
of
the
italian
army
budget
called
on
the
two
officers
to
set
them
straight
tony
at
their
order
took
his
place
beside
the
saddle
constance
was
not
to
be
abandoned
again
to
fidilini
caprice
miss
hazel
and
the
englishwoman
were
ambling
on
ahead
in
as
a
fashion
as
if
that
were
their
usual
mode
of
travel
their
donkeys
were
of
a
sedater
turn
of
mind
than
fidilini
a
fact
for
which
tony
offered
thanks
they
were
by
this
time
well
over
the
worst
part
of
the
mountain
and
the
brief
italian
twilight
was
already
fading
tony
with
a
sharp
eye
on
the
path
ahead
and
a
ready
hand
for
the
bridle
was
attending
strictly
to
the
duties
of
a
it
was
constance
again
who
opened
the
conversation
ah
tony
signorina
did
you
ever
read
any
angleesh
books
or
do
you
do

of
your
reading

dozens
of
them
it
an
old
plot
it
does
require
the
slightest
originality
to
think
of
it
signorina
sank
you
tony
tone
was
exactly
like
gustavo
when
he
has
failed
to
get
the
point
but
feels
that
a
comment
is
necessary
constance
laughed
and
allowed
a
silence
to
follow
while
tony
redirected
his
attention
to
fidilini
movements
his
yip
yip
was
an
exact
imitation
though
in
a
deeper
guttural
of
beppo
cries
before
them
it
would
have
taken
a
close
observer
to
suspect
that
he
had
not
been
bred
to
the
calling

have
not

she
let
the
conversation
drop
and
tony
after
an
interval
of
silence
fell
to
humming

in
a
very
presentable
baritone
the
tune
constance
noted
was
true
enough
but
the
words
were
far
astray

a
very
pretty

tony

signorina
i
just
learn
ze
tune
because
costantina
like
it
you
do
everything
that
costantina
wishes
everysing
but
if
you
could
see
her
you
would
not
wonder
she
has
hair
brown
and
gold
and
her
eyes
signorina
are
sometimes
gray
and
sometimes
black
and
her
laugh
sounds
like
oh
yes
i
know
you
told
me
all
that
before
when
she
goes
out
to
work
in
ze
morning
signorina
wif
the
sunlight
shining
on
her
hair
and
a
smile
on
her
lips
and
a
basket
of
clothes
on
her
head
ah
she
is
beautiful
when
are
you
going
to
be
married
i
do
not
know
signorina
i
have
not
asked
her
yet
then
how
do
you
know
she
wishes
to
marry
you
i
do
not

just
hope
he
rolled
his
eyes
toward
the
moon
which
was
rising
above
the
mountains
on
the
other
side
of
the
lake
and
with
a
deep
sigh
he
fell
back
into
santa
lucia
constance
leaned
forward
and
scanned
his
face
tony
tell
me
your
name
there
was
an
undertone
of
meaning
a
note
of
persuasion
in
her
voice
antonio
signorina
she
shook
her
head
with
a
show
of
impatience
your
real
name
your
last
name
yamhankeesh
oh
she
laughed
antonio
yamhankeesh
does
seem
to
me
a
very
musical
combination
i
do
think
i
ever
heard
anything
like
it
before
it
suits
me
signorina
his
tone
carried
a
suggestion
of
wounded
dignity
yamhankeesh
has
a
ver
beautiful
meaning
in
my
language
who
dares
not
wins
not
and
that
is
your
motto
signorina
a
very
dangerous
motto
tony
it
will
some
day
get
you
into
trouble
they
had
reached
the
base
of
the
mountain
and
their
path
now
broadened
into
the
semblance
of
a
road
which
wound
through
the
fields
between
fragrant
hedgerows
under
towering
chestnut
trees
all
about
them
was
the
fragrance
of
the
dewy
summer
night
the
flash
of
fireflies
the
chirp
of
crickets
occasionally
the
note
of
a
nightingale
before
them
out
of
a
cluster
of
cypresses
rose
the
square
graceful
outline
of
the
village
campanile
constance
looked
about
with
a
pleased
contented
sigh
is
italy
beautiful
tony
yes
signorina
but
i
like
america
better
we
have
no
cypresses
and
ruins
and
nightingales
in
america
tony
we
have
a
moon
sometimes
but
not
that
moon
they
passed
from
the
moonlight
into
the
shade
of
some
overhanging
chestnut
trees
fidilini
stumbled
suddenly
over
a
break
in
the
path
and
tony
pulled
him
up
sharply
his
hand
on
the
bridle
rested
for
an
instant
over
hers
italy
is
beautiful
to
make
love
in
he
whispered
she
drew
her
hand
away
abruptly
and
they
passed
out
into
the
moonlight
again
ahead
of
them
where
the
road
branched
into
the
highway
the
others
were
waiting
for
constance
to
catch
up
the
two
officers
looking
back
with
an
eager
air
of
expectation
tony
glanced
ahead
and
added
with
a
quick
frown
but
perhaps
i
do
not
need
to
tell
you
that
you
may
know
it
already
you
are
impertinent
tony
she
pulled
the
donkey
into
a
trot
that
left
him
behind
the
highway
was
broad
and
they
proceeded
in
a
group
the
conversation
general
and
in
english
tony
quite
naturally
having
no
part
in
it
but
at
the
corners
where
the
road
to
the
village
and
the
road
to
the
villa
separated
fidilini
obligingly
turned
stubborn
again
his
mind
bent
upon
rest
and
supper
he
insisted
upon
going
to
the
village
the
harder
constance
pulled
on
the
left
rein
the
more
fixed
was
his
determination
to
turn
to
the
right
help
i
being
run
away
with
again
she
called
over
her
shoulder
as
the
donkey
pace
quickened
into
a
trot
tony
awakening
to
his
duty
started
in
pursuit
while
the
others
laughingly
shouted
directions
he
did
not
run
as
determinedly
as
he
might
and
they
had
covered
considerable
ground
before
he
overtook
them
he
turned
fidilini
head
and
they
started
back
at
a
walk
signorina
said
tony
may
i
ask
a
question
a
little
impertinent
no
certainly
not
silence
ah
tony
she
asked
presently
signorina
what
is
it
you
want
to
ask
are
you
going
to
marry
that
italian
lieutenant
or
perhaps
the
captain
that
impertinent
are
you
you
forget
yourself
tony
it
is
not
your
place
to
ask
such
a
question
signorina
it
is
my
place
if
it
is
true
i
can
not
be
your
any
longer
no
it
is
not
true
but
that
is
no
concern
of
yours
are
you
going
on
another
trip
friday
to
monte
maggiore
yes
may
i
come
with
you
his
tone
implied
more
than
his
words
she
hesitated
a
moment
then
shrugged
indifferently
just
as
you
please
tony
if
you
do
wish
to
work
for
us
any
more
i
dare
say
we
can
find
another
man
it
is
as
you
please
signorina
if
you
wish
it
i
come
if
you
do
not
wish
it
i
go
she
made
no
answer
they
joined
the
others
and
the
party
proceeded
to
the
villa
gates
lieutenant
di
ferara
helped
constance
dismount
while
captain
coroloni
with
none
too
good
a
grace
held
the
donkey
a
careful
observer
would
have
fancied
that
the
lieutenant
was
ahead
and
that
both
he
and
the
captain
knew
it
tony
untied
the
bundles
dumped
them
on
the
kitchen
floor
and
waited
respectfully
hat
in
hand
while
wilder
searched
his
pockets
for
change
he
counted
out
four
lire
and
added
a
note
tony
pocketed
the
lire
and
returned
the
note
while
wilder
stared
his
astonishment
tony
constance
smiled
as
he
turned
away
signorina
there
was
a
note
of
finality
in
his
voice
well
wilder
ejaculated
that
is
the
first
italian
he
started
to
say
but
he
caught
the
word
before
it
was
out
i
ever
saw
refuse
money
lieutenant
di
ferara
raised
his
shoulders
the
fellow
is
too
honest
you
do
well
to
watch
him
there
was
a
world
of
disgust
in
his
tone
constance
glanced
after
the
retreating
figure
and
laughed
tony
she
called
he
kept
on
she
raised
her
voice
mr
yamhankeesh
he
paused
you
call
signorina
be
sure
and
be
here
by
half
past
six
on
friday
morning
we
must
start
early
sank
you

chapter
viii
the
hotel
du
lac
may
be
approached
in
two
ways
the
ordinary
obvious
way
which
incoming
tourists
of
necessity
choose
is
by
the
highroad
and
the
gate
but
the
romantic
way
is
by
water
one
sees
only
the
garden
then
and
the
garden
is
the
distinguished
feature
of
the
place
it
was
planned
long
before
the
hotel
was
built
to
adorn
a
marquis
pleasure
house
there
are
grottos
arbors
fountains
a
winding
stream
and
stretching
the
length
of
the
water
front
a
deep
cool
grove
of
interlaced
plane
trees
at
the
end
of
the
grove
half
a
dozen
broad
stone
steps
dip
down
to
a
tiny
harbor
which
is
carpeted
on
the
surface
with
lily
pads
the
steps
are
worn
by
the
lapping
waves
of
fifty
years
and
are
grown
over
with
slippery
slimy
water
weeds
the
world
was
just
stirring
from
its
afternoon
siesta
when
the
dropped
her
yellow
sails
and
floated
into
the
shady
little
harbor
giuseppe
prodded
and
pushed
along
the
banks
until
the
keel
jolted
against
the
water
steps
he
sprang
ashore
and
steadied
the
boat
while
constance
alighted
she
slipped
on
the
mossy
step
almost
went
under
and
righted
herself
with
a
laugh
that
rang
gaily
through
the
grove
she
came
up
the
steps
still
smiling
shook
out
her
fluffy
pink
skirts
straightened
her
hat
and
glanced
reconnoiteringly
about
the
grove
one
might
reasonably
expect
attacking
the
hotel
as
it
were
from
the
flank
to
capture
unawares
any
stray
guest
but
aside
from
a
chaffinch
or
so
and
a
spotted
calf
tied
to
a
tree
the
grove
was
empty
blatantly
empty
there
was
a
shade
of
disappointment
in
constance
glance
one
naturally
does
not
like
to
waste
one
best
embroidered
gown
on
a
spotted
calf
then
her
eye
suddenly
brightened
as
it
lighted
on
a
vivid
splash
of
yellow
under
a
tree
she
crossed
over
and
picked
it
up
a
paper
covered
french
novel
the
title
was
the
author
was
gyp
she
turned
to
the
first
page
any
reasonably
careful
person
might
be
expected
to
write
his
name
in
the
front
of
a
book
particularly
a
french
book
before
abandoning
it
to
the
mercies
of
a
foreign
hotel
but
the
several
fly
leaves
were
immaculately
innocent
of
all
sign
of
ownership
so
intent
was
she
upon
this
examination
that
she
did
not
hear
footsteps
approaching
down
the
long
arbor
that
led
from
the
house
so
intent
was
the
young
man
upon
a
frowning
scrutiny
of
the
path
before
him
that
he
did
not
see
constance
until
he
had
passed
from
the
arbor
into
the
grove
then
simultaneously
they
raised
their
heads
and
looked
at
each
other
for
a
startled
second
they
stared
rather
guiltily
both
with
the
air
of
having
been
caught
constance
recovered
her
poise
first
she
nodded
a
nod
which
contained
not
the
slightest
hint
of
recognition
and
laughed
oh
she
said
i
suppose
this
is
your
book
and
i
am
afraid
you
have
caught
me
you
must
excuse
me
for
looking
at
it
but
usually
at
this
season
only
german
stop
at
the
hotel
du
lac
and
i
was
surprised
you
know
to
find
that
german
did
anything
so
frivolous
as
reading
gyp
the
man
bowed
with
a
gesture
which
made
her
free
of
the
book
but
he
continued
his
silence
constance
glanced
at
him
again
and
this
time
she
allowed
a
flash
of
recognition
to
appear
in
her
face
oh
she
with
a
note
of
interested
politeness
you
are
the
young
man
who
stumbled
into
villa
rosa
last
monday
looking
for
the
garden
of
the
prince
he
bowed
a
second
time
an
answering
flash
appearing
in
his
face
illustration
the
man
bowed
with
a
gesture
which
made
her
free
of
the
book
and
you
are
the
young
woman
who
was
sitting
on
the
wall
beside
a
row
of
of
stockings
she
nodded
i
trust
you
found
the
prince
garden
without
difficulty
yes
thank
you
your
directions
were
very
explicit
a
slight
pause
followed
the
young
man
waiting
deferentially
for
her
to
take
the
lead
you
find
valedolmo
interesting
she
inquired
interesting
his
tone
was
enthusiastic
aside
from
the
prince
garden
which
contains
a
cedar
of
lebanon
and
an
india
rubber
plant
from
south
america
there
is
the
luini
in
the
chapel
of
san
bartolomeo
and
the
statue
of
garibaldi
in
the
piazza
and
then
he
waved
his
hand
toward
the
lake
there
is
always
the
view
yes
she
agreed
one
can
always
look
at
the
view
her
eyes
wandered
to
the
lake
and
across
the
lake
to
monte
maggiore
with
clouds
drifting
about
its
peak
and
while
she
obligingly
studied
the
mountain
he
studied
the
effect
of
the
pink
gown
and
the
hat
she
turned
back
suddenly
and
caught
him
it
was
a
disconcerting
habit
of
constance
he
politely
looked
away
and
she
with
frank
interest
studied
him
he
was
bareheaded
and
dressed
in
white
flannels
they
were
very
becoming
she
noted
critically
and
yet
they
needed
just
a
touch
of
color
a
red
sash
for
example
and
earrings
the
guests
of
the
hotel
du
lac
she
remarked
have
a
beautiful
garden
of
their
own
just
the
mere
pleasure
of
strolling
about
in
it
ought
to
keep
them
contented
with
valedolmo
not
necessarily
he
objected
think
of
the
garden
of
eden
the
most
beautiful
garden
there
has
ever
been
if
report
speaks
true
and
yet
the
mere
pleasure
of
strolling
about
did
keep
adam
contented
one
gets
lonely
you
know
are
you
the
only
guest
oh
no
there
are
four
of
us
but
we
not
very
companionable
such
a
discrepancy
in
languages
and
you
do
speak
italian
he
shook
his
head
only
english
and
he
glanced
at
the
book
in
her
hand
french
indifferently
well
i
saw
someone
the
other
day
who
spoke
magyar
that
is
a
beautiful
language
yes
he
returned
with
polite
indifference
i
do
remember
ever
to
have
heard
it
she
laughed
and
glanced
about
her
eyes
lighted
on
the
arbor
hung
with
and
wistaria
where
far
at
the
other
end
gustavo
figure
was
visible
lounging
in
the
yellow
stucco
doorway
the
sight
appeared
to
recall
an
errand
to
her
mind
she
glanced
down
at
a
pink
which
hung
on
her
arm
and
gathered
up
her
skirts
with
a
movement
of
departure
the
young
man
hastily
picked
up
the
conversation
it
a
jolly
old
garden
he
affirmed
and
there
something
pathetic
about
its
appearing
on
souvenir
as
a
mere
adjunct
to
a
blue
and
yellow
hotel
she
nodded
sympathetically
built
for
romance
and
abandoned
to
tourists
german
tourists
at
that
oh
not
entirely
we
a
russian
countess
just
now
a
russian
countess
constance
turned
toward
him
with
an
air
of
reawakened
interest
is
she
as
young
and
beautiful
and
fascinating
and
wicked
as
they
always
are
in
novels
oh
dear
no
seventy
if
she
a
day
a
nice
grandmotherly
old
soul
who
smokes
cigarettes
ah
constance
smiled
there
was
even
a
trace
of
relief
in
her
manner
as
she
nodded
to
the
young
man
and
turned
away
his
face
reflected
his
disappointment
he
plainly
wished
to
detain
her
but
could
think
of
no
expedient
the
spotted
calf
came
to
his
rescue
the
calf
had
been
watching
them
from
the
first
very
much
interested
in
the
visitor
and
now
as
she
approached
his
tree
he
stretched
out
his
neck
as
far
as
the
tether
permitted
and
sniffed
insistently
she
paused
and
patted
him
on
the
head
the
calf
acknowledged
the
caress
with
a
grateful
there
was
a
plaintive
light
in
his
liquid
eyes
poor
thing
he
lonely
she
turned
to
the
young
man
and
spoke
with
an
accent
of
reproach
the
four
guests
of
the
hotel
du
lac
do
show
him
enough
attention
the
young
man
shrugged
we
tired
of
calves
it
only
a
matter
of
a
day
or
so
before
he
be
breaded
and
fried
and
served
milanese
fashion
with
a
sauce
of
tomato
and
garlic
constance
shook
her
head
sympathetically
though
whether
her
sympathy
was
for
the
calf
or
the
partakers
of
was
not
quite
clear
i
know
she
agreed
i
been
a
guest
at
the
hotel
du
lac
myself
a
tragedy
to
be
born
a
calf
in
italy
she
nodded
and
turned
it
was
evident
this
time
that
she
was
really
going
he
took
a
hasty
step
forward
oh
i
say
please
do
go
stay
and
talk
to
me
just
a
little
while
that
calf
is
half
so
lonely
as
i
am
i
should
like
to
but
really
i
must
elizabetta
is
waiting
for
me
to
bring
her
some
eggs
we
are
planning
a
trip
up
the
maggiore
tomorrow
and
we
have
to
have
a
cake
to
take
with
us
elizabetta
made
one
this
morning
but
she
forgot
to
put
in
the
baking
powder
italian
cooks
are
not
used
to
making
cakes
they
are
much
better
at
her
eyes
fell
on
the
calf
veal
and
such
things
he
folded
his
arms
with
an
air
of
desperation
i
an
american
one
of
your
own
countrymen
if
you
had
a
grain
of
charity
in
your
nature
you
would
let
the
cake
go
she
shook
her
head
relentlessly
five
days
at
valedolmo
you
would
not
believe
the
straits
i
been
driven
to
in
search
of
amusement
yes
there
was
a
touch
of
curiosity
in
her
tone
what
for
example
i
am
teaching
gustavo
how
to
play
tennis
oh
she
said
how
does
he
do
broken
three
windows
and
a
flower
pot
and
lost
four
balls
she
laughed
and
turned
away
and
then
as
an
idea
occurred
to
her
she
turned
back
and
fixed
her
eyes
sympathetically
on
his
face
i
suppose
valedolmo
stupid
for
a
man
but
why
do
you
try
mountain
climbing
everybody
finds
that
diverting
there
a
guide
here
who
speaks
english
really
comprehensible
english
he
engaged
for
tomorrow
but
after
that
i
dare
say
he
be
free
gustavo
can
tell
you
about
him
she
nodded
and
smiled
and
turned
down
the
arbor
the
young
man
stood
where
she
left
him
with
folded
arms
watching
her
pink
gown
as
it
receded
down
the
long
alley
hung
with
purple
and
green
he
waited
until
it
had
been
swallowed
up
in
the
yellow
doorway
then
he
fetched
a
deep
breath
and
strolled
to
the
after
a
few
moments
prophetic
contemplation
of
the
mountain
across
the
lake
he
threw
back
his
head
with
a
quick
amused
laugh
and
got
out
a
cigarette
and
lighted
it
chapter
ix
as
constance
emerged
at
the
other
end
of
the
arbor
gustavo
who
had
been
nodding
on
the
bench
beside
the
door
sprang
to
his
feet
consternation
in
his
attitude
signorina
he
stammered
you
come
from
ze
garden
she
nodded
in
her
usual
manner
and
handed
him
the
basket
eggs
gustavo
two
dozen
if
you
can
spare
them
i
am
sorry
always
to
be
wanting
so
many
but
she
sighed
eggs
are
so
breakable
gustavo
rolled
his
eyes
to
heaven
in
silent
thanksgiving
she
had
not
it
was
evident
run
across
the
american
and
the
cat
was
still
safely
in
the
bag
but
how
much
longer
it
could
be
kept
there
the
saints
alone
knew
he
was
feeling
very
properly
guilty
in
regard
to
this
latest
escapade
but
what
can
a
defenceless
waiter
do
in
the
hands
of
an
impetuous
young
american
whose
pockets
are
stuffed
with
silver
lire
and
notes
two
dozen
certainly
signorina
he
took
the
basket
and
hurried
to
the
kitchen
constance
occupied
the
interval
with
the
polyglot
parrot
of
the
courtyard
the
parrot
since
she
had
last
conversed
with
him
had
acquired
several
new
expressions
in
the
english
tongue
as
gustavo
reappeared
with
the
eggs
she
confronted
him
sternly
have
you
been
teaching
this
bird
english
i
am
surprised

signorina

gustavo
mopped
his
brow

language

very
shocking
signorina

the
way

how
does
it
happen
that
that
young
american
man
who
left
last
week
is
still
here
gustavo
nearly
dropped
the
eggs
i
just
saw
him
in
the
garden
with
a
book
i
am
sure
it
was
the
same
young
man
what
is
he
doing
all
this
time
in
valedolmo
gustavo
eyes
roved
wildly
until
they
lighted
on
the
tennis
court
he
he

play
lawn
tennis
wif
me
but
he
go
tomorrow
oh

what
his
name
gustavo
she
put
the
question
indifferently
while
she
stooped
to
pet
a
cat
that
was
curled
asleep
on
the
bench
his
name
gustavo
face
cleared
i
get
ze
raygeester
you
read
heem
yourself
he
darted
into
the
bureau
and
returned
with
a
black
book
signorina
spreading
it
on
the
table
before
her
his
alacrity
should
have
aroused
her
suspicions
but
she
was
too
intent
on
the
matter
in
hand
she
turned
the
pages
and
paused
at
the
entries
rudolph
ziegelmann
und
frau
berlin
and
just
beneath
in
bold
black
letters
that
stretched
from
margin
to
margin
abraham
lincoln
gustavo
hovered
above
anxiously
watching
her
face
he
had
been
told
that
this
would
make
everything
right
that
abraham
lincoln
was
an
exceedingly
respectable
name
constance
expression
did
not
change
she
looked
at
the
writing
for
fully
three
minutes
then
she
opened
her
purse
and
looked
inside
she
laid
the
money
for
the
eggs
in
a
pile
on
the
table
and
took
out
an
extra
lira
which
she
held
in
her
hand
gustavo
she
asked
do
you
think
that
you
tell
me
the
truth
signorina
he
said
reproachfully
how
did
that
name
get
there
he
write
it
heemself
illustration
she
turned
the
pages
and
paused
at
the
week
entries
yes
i
dare
say
he
did
but
it
does
happen
to
be
his
name
oh
not
blind
i
can
see
plainly
enough
that
he
has
scratched
out
his
own
name
underneath
gustavo
leaned
forward
and
affected
to
examine
the
page
it
was
a
blot
signorina
he
scratch
heem
out
gustavo
her
tone
was
despairing
are
you
incapable
of
telling
the
truth
that
young
man
name
is
no
more
abraham
lincoln
than
victor
emmanuel
ii
when
did
he
write
that
and
why
gustavo
eyes
were
on
the
lira
he
broke
down
and
told
the
truth
yesterday
night
signorina
he
say
next
time

is
beautiful
as

letters

again
gustavo
she
cocked
her
head
he
gathered
himself
together
for
a
supreme
effort
he
rolled
his
r
he
shouted
until
the
courtyard
reverberated
constance
shook
her
head
sounds
like
hungarian
at
least
the
way
you
pronounce
it
but
anyway
it
of
no
consequence
i
merely
asked
out
of
idle
curiosity
and
gustavo
she
still
held
the
lira
if
he
asks
you
if
i
looked
in
this
register
what
are
you
going
to
say
i
say
meestair

all
ze
time
in
ze
courtyard
talking
wif
ze
parrot
and
she
was
ver
moch
shocked
at
his
angleesh
ah
constance
smiled
and
laid
the
lira
on
the
table
gustavo
she
said
i
hope
for
the
sake
of
your
immortal
soul
that
you
go
often
to
confession
the
eggs
were
not
heavy
but
gustavo
insisted
upon
carrying
them
he
was
determined
to
see
her
safely
aboard
the
with
no
further
accidents
possible
that
she
had
not
identified
the
young
man
of
the
garden
with
the
of
yesterday
was
clear
though
how
such
blindness
was
possible
was
not
clear
probably
she
had
only
caught
a
glimpse
of
his
back
at
a
distance
in
any
case
he
thanked
a
merciful
providence
and
decided
to
risk
no
further
chance
as
they
neared
the
end
of
the
arbor
gustavo
was
talking
shouting
fairly
their
approach
was
heralded
they
turned
into
the
grove
to
gustavo
horror
the
most
conspicuous
object
in
it
was
this
same
reckless
young
man
seated
on
the
nonchalantly
smoking
a
cigarette
the
young
man
rose
and
bowed
constance
nodded
carelessly
while
gustavo
behind
her
back
made
frantic
signs
for
him
to
flee
to
escape
while
still
there
was
time
the
young
man
telegraphed
back
by
the
same
sign
language
that
there
was
no
danger
she
did
suspect
the
truth
and
to
gustavo
amazement
he
fell
in
beside
them
and
strolled
over
to
the
water
steps
his
recklessness
was
catching
gustavo
suddenly
determined
upon
a
bold
stroke
himself
signorina
he
asked
zat
man
i
send
zat
donk
driver
you
like
heem
tony
her
manner
was
indifferent
oh
he
does
well
enough
he
seems
honest
and
truthful
though
a
little
stupid
gustavo
and
the
young
man
exchanged
glances
and
gustavo
she
turned
to
him
with
a
sweetly
serious
air
that
admitted
no
manner
of
doubt
but
that
she
was
in
earnest
i
told
this
young
man
that
in
case
he
cared
to
do
any
mountain
climbing
you
would
find
him
the
same
guide
it
would
be
very
useful
for
him
to
have
one
who
speaks
english
gustavo
bowed
in
mute
acquiescence
he
could
find
no
adequate
words
for
the
situation
the
boat
drew
alongside
and
constance
stepped
in
but
she
did
not
sit
down
her
attention
was
attracted
by
two
who
had
come
clattering
on
to
the
little
rustic
bridge
that
spanned
the
stream
above
the
water
steps
the
women
their
baskets
of
linen
on
their
heads
had
paused
to
watch
the
embarkation
ah
gustavo
constance
asked
over
her
shoulder
is
there
a
here
at
the
hotel
du
lac
named
costantina
signorina
zat
is
costantina
standing
on
ze
bridge
wif
ze
yellow
handkerchief
on
her
head
constance
looked
at
costantina
and
nodded
and
smiled
then
she
laughed
out
loud
a
beautiful
rippling
joyous
laugh
that
rang
through
the
grove
and
silenced
the
chaffinches
perhaps
once
upon
a
time
costantina
was
beautiful
beautiful
as
the
angels
but
if
so
it
was
long
long
ago
now
she
was
old
and
fat
with
a
hawk
nose
and
a
double
chin
and
one
tooth
left
in
the
middle
of
the
front
but
if
she
were
not
beautiful
she
was
at
least
a
cheerful
old
soul
and
though
she
could
not
possibly
know
the
reason
she
echoed
the
signorina
laugh
until
she
nearly
shook
the
clean
clothes
into
the
water
constance
settled
herself
among
the
cushions
and
glanced
back
toward
the
terrace
good
afternoon
she
nodded
politely
to
the
young
man
he
bowed
with
his
hand
on
his
heart
gustavo
he
bowed
until
his
napkin
swept
the
ground
costantina
she
waved
her
hand
toward
her
namesake
the
laughed
again
and
her
earrings
flashed
in
the
sunlight
giuseppe
raised
the
yellow
sail
they
caught
the
breeze
and
the
floated
away
chapter
x
half
past
six
on
friday
morning
and
constance
appeared
on
the
terrace
constance
in
fluffy
billowy
lacy
white
with
a
spray
of
oleander
in
her
belt
the
last
costume
in
the
world
in
which
one
would
start
on
a
mountain
climb
she
cast
a
glance
in
passing
toward
the
gateway
and
the
stretch
of
road
visible
beyond
but
both
were
empty
and
seating
herself
on
the
parapet
she
turned
her
attention
to
the
lake
the
breeze
that
blew
from
the
farther
shore
brought
fresh
alpine
odors
of
flowers
and
pine
trees
constance
sniffed
it
eagerly
as
she
gazed
across
toward
the
purple
outline
of
monte
maggiore
the
serenity
of
her
smile
gradually
gave
place
to
doubt
she
turned
and
glanced
back
toward
the
house
visibly
changing
her
mind
but
before
the
change
was
finished
the
quiet
of
the
morning
was
broken
by
a
clatter
of
tiny
scrambling
obstinate
hoofs
and
a
series
of
ejaculations
both
latin
and
english
she
glanced
toward
the
gate
where
fidilini
was
visible
plainly
determined
not
to
come
in
constance
laughed
expectantly
and
turned
back
to
the
water
her
eyes
intent
on
the
that
were
putting
out
from
the
little
the
sounds
of
coercion
increased
a
command
floated
down
the
driveway
in
the
english
tongue
it
sounded
like
you
twist
his
tail
beppo
while
i
pull
apparently
it
was
understood
in
spite
of
beppo
slight
knowledge
of
the
language
an
eloquent
silence
followed
then
an
outraged
grunt
on
the
part
of
fidilini
and
the
cavalcade
advanced
with
a
rush
to
the
kitchen
door
tony
left
beppo
and
the
donkeys
and
crossed
the
terrace
alone
his
bow
swept
the
ground
in
the
deferential
manner
of
gustavo
but
his
glance
was
far
bolder
than
a
should
have
been
she
noted
the
fact
and
tossed
him
a
nod
of
marked
condescension
a
silence
followed
during
which
constance
studied
the
lake
when
she
turned
back
she
found
tony
arranging
a
spray
of
oleander
that
had
dropped
from
her
belt
in
the
band
of
his
hat
she
viewed
this
performance
in
silent
disfavor
having
finished
to
his
satisfaction
he
tossed
the
hat
aside
and
seated
himself
on
the
balustrade
her
frown
became
visible
tony
sprang
to
his
feet
with
an
air
of
anxiety
signorina
i
have
not
meant
to
be
presumptious
perhaps
it
is
not
fitting
that
anyone
below
the
rank
of
lieutenant
should
sit
in
your
presence
it
will
not
be
very
long
tony
before
you
are
discharged
for
impertinence
ah
signorina
do
not
say
that
if
it
is
your
wish
i
will
kneel
when
i
address
you
my
family
signorina
are
poor
they
need
the
four
francs
which
you
so
munificently
pay
you
told
me
that
you
were
an
orphan
that
you
had
no
family
i
mean
the
family
which
i
hope
to
have
costantina
has
extravagant
tastes
and
coral
earrings
cost
a
pair
constance
laughed
and
assumed
a
more
lenient
air
she
made
a
slight
gesture
which
might
be
interpreted
as
an
invitation
to
sit
down
and
tony
accepted
it
by
the
way
tony
how
do
you
talk
to
costantina
since
she
speaks
no
english
and
you
no
italian
we
have
no
need
of
either
italian
or
english
the
language
of
love
signorina
is
universal
oh
she
laughed
again
i
was
at
the
hotel
du
lac
yesterday
i
saw
costantina

a
fool
just
to

zat
costantina
he
leaned
forward
and
looked
into
her
eyes
a
slow
red
flush
crept
over
constance
face
and
she
turned
her
head
away
and
looked
across
the
water
wilder
in
full
alpine
regalia
stepped
out
upon
the
terrace
and
viewed
the
beauty
of
the
morning
with
a
prophetic
eye
miss
hazel
followed
in
his
wake
she
wore
a
lavender
dimity
and
suddenly
it
occurred
to
tony
slow
moving
masculine
perception
that
neither
lavender
dimity
nor
white
muslin
were
fabrics
fit
for
mountain
climbing
constance
slipped
down
from
her
parapet
and
hurried
to
meet
them
aunt
hazel
morning
dad
you
look
beautiful
nothing
so
becoming
to
a
man
as
knickerbockers
especially
if
he
a
little
you
late
she
added
with
a
touch
of
severity
breakfast
has
been
waiting
half
an
hour
and
tony
fifteen
minutes
she
turned
back
toward
the
who
was
standing
hat
in
hand
respectfully
waiting
orders
oh
tony
i
forgot
to
tell
you
we
shall
not
need
beppo
and
the
donkeys
you
and
my
father
are
going
alone
you
no
want
to
climb
monte
maggiore
ver
beautiful
mountain
there
was
disappointment
reproach
rebellion
in
his
tone
we
have
made
inquiries
and
my
aunt
thinks
it
too
long
a
trip
without
the
donkeys
you
can
cross
by
boat
and
that
cuts
off
three
miles
as
you
please
signorina
he
turned
away
constance
looked
after
him
with
a
shade
of
remorse
when
this
plan
of
sending
her
father
and
tony
alone
had
occurred
to
her
as
she
sailed
homeward
yesterday
from
the
hotel
du
lac
it
had
seemed
a
humorous
and
fitting
retribution
the
young
man
had
been
just
a
trifle
too
sure
of
her
interest
the
episode
of
the
hotel
register
must
not
go
unpunished
but
it
was
a
beautiful
morning
a
long
empty
day
stretched
before
her
and
monte
maggiore
looked
alluring
there
was
no
pursuit
for
the
moment
which
she
enjoyed
as
much
as
oh
yes
she
was
spiting
herself
as
well
as
tony
but
considering
the
circumstances
the
sacrifice
seemed
necessary
when
the
drifted
up
ready
to
take
the
miss
hazel
suggested
constance
possessed
to
a
large
degree
the
diplomatic
faculty
of
making
other
people
propose
what
she
herself
had
decided
on
that
she
and
her
niece
cross
with
them
tony
was
sulky
and
constance
could
not
forego
the
pleasure
of
baiting
him
further
they
put
in
at
the
village
on
their
way
for
the
morning
mail
wilder
wished
his
paper
even
at
the
risk
of
not
beginning
the
ascent
before
the
sun
was
high
giuseppe
brought
back
from
the
post
among
other
matters
a
letter
for
constance
the
address
was
in
a
dashing
angular
hand
that
pretty
thoroughly
covered
the
envelope
had
she
not
been
so
intent
on
the
writing
herself
she
would
have
noted
tony
astonished
stare
as
he
passed
it
to
her
why
she
exclaimed
here
a
letter
from
nannie
hilliard
postmarked
lucerne
lucerne
miss
hazel
echoed
her
surprise
i
thought
they
were
to
be
in

for
the
summer
they
were
the
last
i
heard
constance
ripped
the
letter
open
and
read
it
aloud
illustration
constance
ripped
the
letter
open
and
read
it
aloud
dear
constance
you
doubtless
be
surprised
to
hear
from
us
in
switzerland
instead
of
in
england
and
to
learn
further
that
in
the
course
of
a
week
we
shall
arrive
at
valedolmo
en
route
for
the
dolomites
jerry
junior
at
the
last
moment
decided
to
come
with
us
and
you
know
what
a
is
when
it
comes
to
european
travel
instead
of
taking
two
months
comfortably
to
england
as
aunt
kate
and
i
had
planned
we
did
the
whole
of
the
british
isles
in
ten
days
and
holland
and
france
at
the
same
breathless
rate
jerry
says
he
holds
the
record
for
the
louvre
he
struck
a
pace
at
the
entrance
and
by
looking
neither
to
the
right
nor
the
left
he
did
the
whole
building
in
minutes
you
can
imagine
the
exhausted
state
aunt
kate
and
i
are
in
after
travelling
five
weeks
with
him
we
simply
struck
in
switzerland
and
sent
him
on
to
italy
alone
i
had
hoped
he
would
meet
us
in
valedolmo
but
we
have
been
detained
here
longer
than
we
expected
and
now
he
rushed
off
again
where
to
goodness
only
knows
we
do
anyway
aunt
kate
and
i
shall
land
in
valedolmo
about
the
end
of
the
week
i
am
dying
to
see
you
i
have
some
beautiful
news
too
complicated
to
write
we
engaged
rooms
at
the
hotel
du
lac
i
hope
it
decent
it
the
only
place
starred
in
baedeker
aunt
kate
wishes
to
be
remembered
to
your
father
and
miss
hazel
yours
ever
nan
hilliard
i
awfully
sorry
not
to
bring
jerry
i
know
you
adore
him
she
returned
the
letter
to
its
envelope
and
looked
up
now
is
that
abominable
she
demanded
abominable
miss
hazel
was
scandalized
my
dear
i
think
delightful
oh
yes
i
mean
about
jerry
junior
i
been
trying
for
six
years
to
get
hold
of
that
man
tony
behind
them
made
a
sudden
movement
that
let
out
nearly
a
yard
of
rope
and
the
listed
heavily
to
starboard
tony
constance
threw
over
her
shoulder
do
you
know
enough
to
sit
still
when
you
are
holding
the
sheet
he
murmured
the
sulky
look
had
vanished
from
his
face
he
wore
an
expression
of
alert
attention
of
course
we
shall
have
them
at
the
villa
said
miss
hazel
and
we
shall
have
to
get
some
new
dishes
elizabetta
has
already
broken
so
many
plates
that
she
has
to
stop
and
wash
them
between
courses
constance
looked
dreamily
across
the
lake
she
appeared
to
be
thinking
i
wonder
she
inquired
finally
if
jerry
junior
knew
we
were
here
in
valedolmo
her
father
emerged
from
the
columns
of
his
paper
of
course
he
knew
it
and
having
heard
what
a
dangerous
young
person
you
were
he
said
to
himself
better
keep
out
i
wish
i
knew
it
would
make
the
score
against
him
considerably
heavier
so
there
is
already
a
score
i
had
supposed
that
the
game
had
begun
she
nodded
six
years
ago
but
he
does
know
it
yes
dad
her
tone
was
melodramatic
for
six
years
i
been
waiting
for
jerry
junior
and
planning
my
revenge
and
now
when
i
have
him
almost
in
my
grasp
he
eludes
me
again
dear
me
wilder
ejaculated
what
did
the
young
man
do
had
constance
turned
she
would
have
found
tony
face
an
interesting
study
but
she
knew
well
enough
without
looking
at
him
that
he
was
listening
to
the
conversation
and
she
determined
to
give
him
something
to
listen
to
it
was
a
salutary
thing
for
tony
to
be
kept
in
mind
of
the
fact
that
there
were
other
men
in
the
world
she
sighed
he
was
the
first
man
i
ever
loved
father
and
he
spurned
me
do
you
remember
that
christmas
when
i
was
in
and
you
were
called
south
on
business
i
wanted
to
visit
nancy
long
but
you
would
let
me
because
you
did
like
her
father
and
you
got
jerymn
hilliard
whom
i
had
never
set
eyes
on
to
invite
me
there
i
did
want
to
go
and
you
said
i
must
and
were
perfectly
horrid
about
it
you
remember
that
wilder
grunted
yes
i
see
you
do
and
you
remember
how
with
my
usual
sweetness
i
finally
gave
way
well
dad
you
never
knew
the
reason
the
yale
glee
club
came
to
westfield
that
year
just
before
the
holidays
began
and
miss
jane
let
everybody
go
to
the
concert
whose
deportment
had
been
above
eighty
that
of
course
included
me
well
we
all
went
and
we
all
fell
in
love
in
a
body
with
a
sophomore
who
played
the
banjo
and
sang
negro
songs
he
had
lovely
dark
eyes
and
he
sang
funny
songs
without
smiling
the
whole
school
raved
about
him
all
the
way
home
we
cut
his
picture
out
of
the
program
and
pasted
in
the
front
of
our
watches
his
name
father
she
paused
dramatically
was
jerymn
hilliard
junior
i
sat
up
half
the
night
writing
diplomatic
letters
to
you
and
hilliard
and
the
next
day
when
it
got
around
that
i
was
actually
going
to
visit
in
his
house
well
i
was
the
most
popular
girl
in
school
i
was
sixteen
years
old
then
i
wore
sailor
suits
and
my
hair
was
braided
down
my
back
probably
i
did
look
young
and
then
nannie
whom
i
was
supposedly
visiting
was
only
fifteen
there
were
a
lot
of
cousins
in
the
house
besides
all
the
little
hilliards
and
what
do
you
think
they
made
the
children
eat
in
the
schoolroom
i
never
saw
him
until
christmas
night
then
when
we
were
introduced
he
shook
my
hand
in
a
listless
sort
of
way
said
d
y
do
and
forgot
all
about
me
he
went
off
with
the
glee
club
the
next
day
and
i
only
saw
him
once
more
we
were
playing
blind
man
buff
in
the
i
had
just
been
caught
by
the
hair
it
hurt
and
i
was
squealing
everybody
else
was
clapping
and
laughing
when
suddenly
the
door
burst
open
and
there
stood
jerry
junior
he
looked
straight
at
me
and
growled
are
you
kids
making
such
an
infernal
racket
about
she
shut
her
eyes
aunt
hazel
dad
just
think
he
was
my
first
love
his
picture
was
at
that
moment
in
a
locket
around
my
neck
and
he
called
me
a
and
you
never
seen
him
since
miss
hazel
smile
expressed
amused
indulgence
constance
shook
her
head
he
always
been
away
when
i
visited
nan
and
for
six
years
i
been
waiting
she
straightened
up
with
an
air
of
determination
but
now
if
he
on
the
continent
of
europe
i
get
him
and
what
shall
you
do
with
him
her
father
mildly
inquired
do
with
him
i
make
him
take
it
back
i
make
him
eat
that
word
kid
h
said
her
father
i
hope
you
get
him
he
might
act
as
an
antidote
to
some
of
these
officers
they
had
run
in
under
the
shadow
of
the
mountain
and
the
keel
grated
on
the
shore
constance
raised
her
eyes
and
studied
the
towering
crag
above
their
heads
when
she
lowered
them
again
her
gaze
for
an
instant
met
tony
there
was
a
new
light
in
his
eyes
amusement
triumph
something
entirely
baffling
he
gave
her
the
intangible
feeling
of
having
at
last
got
the
mastery
of
the
situation
chapter
xi
the
sun
was
setting
behind
monte
maggiore
the
fishing
smacks
were
coming
home
luigi
had
long
since
carried
the
tea
things
into
the
house
but
still
the
two
callers
lingered
on
the
terrace
of
villa
rosa
it
was
lieutenant
di
ferara
place
to
go
first
since
he
had
come
first
and
captain
coroloni
doggedly
held
his
post
until
such
time
as
his
junior
officer
should
see
fit
to
take
himself
off
the
captain
knew
as
well
as
everyone
else
at
the
officer
mess
that
in
the
end
the
lieutenant
would
be
the
favored
man
for
he
was
a
son
of
count
guido
di
ferara
of
turin
and
titles
are
at
a
premium
in
the
american
market
but
still
the
marriage
contract
was
not
signed
yet
and
the
fact
remained
that
the
captain
had
come
last
accordingly
he
waited
they
had
been
there
fully
two
hours
and
poor
miss
hazel
was
worn
with
the
strain
she
sat
nervously
on
the
edge
of
her
chair
and
leaned
forward
with
clasped
hands
listening
intently
it
required
very
keen
attention
to
keep
the
run
of
either
the
captain
or
the
english
a
few
days
before
she
had
laughed
at
what
seemed
to
be
a
funny
story
and
had
later
learned
that
it
was
an
announcement
of
the
death
of
the
lieutenant
grandmother
today
she
confined
her
answers
to
inarticulate
murmurs
which
might
be
interpreted
as
either
assents
or
negations
as
the
case
required
constance
however
was
buoyantly
at
her
ease
she
loved
nothing
better
than
the
excitement
of
a
difficult
situation
as
she
bridged
over
pauses
and
unobtrusively
translated
from
the
officer
english
into
real
english
she
at
the
same
time
kept
a
watchful
eye
on
the
water
she
had
her
own
reasons
for
wishing
to
detain
the
callers
until
her
return
presently
she
saw
across
the
lake
a
yellow
sailboat
float
out
from
the
shadow
of
monte
maggiore
and
head
in
a
long
tack
toward
villa
rosa
with
this
she
gave
up
the
task
of
keeping
the
conversation
general
and
abandoning
captain
coroloni
to
her
aunt
she
strolled
over
to
the
terrace
parapet
with
lieutenant
di
ferara
at
her
side
the
picture
they
made
was
a
charming
color
scheme
constance
wore
white
the
lieutenant
pale
blue
an
oleander
tree
beside
them
showed
a
cloud
of
pink
blossoms
while
behind
them
for
a
background
appeared
the
rose
of
the
villa
wall
and
the
deep
green
of
cypresses
against
a
sunset
sky
the
picture
was
particularly
effective
as
seen
from
the
point
of
view
of
an
approaching
boat
constance
broke
off
a
spray
of
oleander
and
while
she
listened
to
the
lieutenant
recountal
of
a
practice
march
she
picked
up
his
hat
from
the
balustrade
and
idly
arranged
the
flowers
in
the
vizor
he
bent
toward
her
and
said
something
she
responded
with
a
laugh
they
were
both
too
occupied
to
notice
that
the
boat
had
floated
close
in
shore
until
the
flap
of
the
falling
sail
announced
its
presence
constance
glanced
up
with
a
start
she
caught
her
father
eye
fixed
anxiously
upon
her
whatever
gustavo
and
the
officer
mess
of
the
tenth
cavalry
might
think
he
had
not
the
slightest
wish
in
the
world
to
see
his
daughter
the
contessa
di
ferara
tony
face
also
wore
an
expression
he
was
sober
disgusted
disdainful
there
was
a
glint
of
anger
and
determination
in
his
eye
constance
hurried
to
the
water
steps
to
greet
her
father
of
tony
she
took
no
manner
of
notice
if
a
man
elects
to
be
a
he
must
swallow
the
insults
that
go
with
the
part
the
officers
observing
that
luigi
was
hovering
about
the
doorway
waiting
to
announce
dinner
waived
the
question
of
precedence
and
made
their
adieus
while
wilder
and
miss
hazel
were
intent
on
the
labored
farewell
speech
the
lieutenant
crossed
to
constance
who
still
stood
at
the
head
of
the
water
steps
he
murmured
something
in
italian
as
he
bowed
over
her
hand
and
raised
it
to
his
lips
constance
blushed
very
becomingly
as
she
drew
her
hand
away
she
was
aware
if
the
officer
was
not
that
tony
was
standing
beside
them
looking
on
but
as
he
raised
his
eyes
he
too
became
aware
of
it
the
man
expression
was
more
than
impertinent
the
lieutenant
stepped
to
his
side
and
said
something
low
and
rapid
something
which
should
have
made
a
touch
his
hat
and
slink
off
but
tony
held
his
ground
with
a
laugh
which
was
more
impertinent
than
the
stare
had
been
the
lieutenant
face
flushed
angrily
and
his
hand
half
instinctively
went
to
his
sword
constance
stepped
forward
tony
i
shall
have
no
further
need
of
your
services
you
may
go
tony
suddenly
came
to
his
senses
i
beg
your
pardon
miss
wilder
he
stammered
i
shall
not
want
you
again
please
go
she
turned
her
back
and
joined
the
others
the
two
officers
with
final
salutes
took
themselves
off
miss
hazel
hurried
indoors
to
make
ready
for
dinner
wilder
followed
in
her
wake
muttering
something
about
finding
the
change
to
pay
tony
constance
stood
where
they
left
her
staring
at
the
pavement
with
hotly
burning
cheeks
miss
wilder
tony
crossed
to
her
side
his
manner
was
humble
actually
humble
the
usual
mocking
undertone
in
his
voice
was
missing
really
awfully
sorry
to
have
caused
you
annoyance
it
was
unpardonable
constance
turned
toward
him
yes
tony
i
think
it
was
your
position
does
not
give
you
the
right
to
insult
my
guests
tony
stiffened
slightly
i
acknowledge
that
i
insulted
him
and
i
sorry
but
he
insulted
me
for
the
matter
of
that
i
did
like
the
way
he
looked
at
me
any
more
than
he
liked
the
way
i
looked
at
him
there
is
a
certain
deference
tony
which
an
officer
in
the
royal
italian
army
has
a
right
to
expect
from
a
tony
shrugged
it
is
a
difficult
position
to
hold
miss
wilder
a
i
find
plays
the
same
accommodating
rôle
as
the
family
you
pat
him
when
you
choose
you
kick
him
when
you
choose
and
he
is
supposed
to
swallow
both
attentions
with
equal
grace
you
should
have
chosen
another
profession
naturally
i
was
not
flattered
to
find
that
your
real
reason
for
staying
at
home
today
was
that
you
were
expecting
more
entertaining
callers
is
there
any
use
in
discussing
it
further
i
am
not
going
to
climb
any
more
mountains
and
i
shall
not
as
i
told
you
need
a
again
then
i
discharged
if
you
wish
to
put
it
so
you
must
see
for
yourself
that
the
play
has
gone
far
enough
however
it
has
been
amusing
and
we
will
at
least
part
friends
she
held
out
her
hand
it
was
a
mark
of
definite
dismissal
rather
than
a
token
of
friendly
forgiveness
tony
bowed
over
her
hand
in
perfect
mimicry
of
the
lieutenant
manner
signorina
he
gravely
raised
it
to
his
lips
she
snatched
her
hand
away
quickly
and
without
glancing
at
him
turned
toward
the
house
he
let
her
cross
half
the
terrace
then
he
called
softly
signorina
she
kept
on
without
pausing
he
took
a
quick
step
after
signorina
a
moment
she
half
turned
well
i
beg
of
you
one
little
favor
there
are
two
american
ladies
expected
at
the
hotel
du
lac
and
i
thought
perhaps
would
you
mind
writing
me
a
letter
of
recommendation
constance
turned
back
without
a
word
and
walked
into
the
house
wilder
conversation
at
dinner
that
night
was
of
the
excursion
and
tony
he
was
elated
enthusiastic
glowing
was
the
most
interesting
pursuit
in
the
world
he
would
begin
tomorrow
and
exhaust
the
alps
and
as
for
tony
his
intelligence
his
discretion
his
cleverness
there
never
had
been
such
a
guide
constance
listened
silently
her
eyes
on
her
plate
at
another
time
it
might
have
occurred
to
her
that
her
father
enthusiasm
was
excessive
but
tonight
she
was
occupied
with
her
thoughts
and
she
had
no
reason
in
the
world
to
suspect
him
of
guile
she
decided
however
to
postpone
the
announcement
of
tony
dismissal
tomorrow
might
look
less
alluring
dinner
over
wilder
with
a
tired
if
satisfied
sigh
dropped
into
a
chair
to
finish
his
reading
of
the
london
he
no
longer
skimmed
his
paper
lightly
as
in
the
days
when
papers
were
to
be
had
hot
at
any
hour
he
read
it
carefully
painstakingly
from
the
first
advertisement
to
the
last
obituary
and
he
laid
it
down
in
the
end
with
a
disappointed
sigh
that
there
were
not
more
residential
properties
for
hire
that
the
day
death
list
was
so
meager
miss
hazel
settled
herself
to
her
knitting
she
was
making
a
shawl
of
seven
colors
and
an
intricate
pattern
and
she
had
to
count
her
stitches
conversation
was
impossible
constance
vaguely
restless
picked
up
a
book
and
laid
it
down
and
finally
sauntered
out
to
the
terrace
with
no
thought
in
the
world
but
to
see
the
moon
rise
over
the
mountains
as
she
approached
the
parapet
she
became
aware
that
someone
was
lounging
on
the
smoking
a
cigarette
the
smoker
rose
politely
but
ventured
no
remark
is
that
you
giuseppe
she
asked
in
italian
no
signorina
it
is
i
tony
i
am
waiting
for
orders
for
orders
there
was
astonishment
as
well
as
indignation
in
her
tone
i
thought
i
made
it
clear
that
i
was
discharged
yes
signorina
but
i
have
been
so
fortunate
as
to
find
another
place

signor
papa

wif
him
we
climb
all
ze
mountain
around
he
waved
his
hand
largely
to
comprise
the
whole
landscape
i
sink
perhaps
it
is
better
so
for
the
signor
papa
and
me
to
go
alone
mountain
climbing
is
too
hard
zere
is
too
much
fatigue
signorina
for
you
he
bowed
humbly
and
deferentially
and
retired
to
the
steps
and
his
cigarette
chapter
xii
half
past
six
on
the
following
morning
found
constance
and
her
father
rising
from
the
breakfast
table
and
tony
turning
in
at
the
gate
constance
nod
of
greeting
was
barely
perceptible
and
her
father
eye
contained
a
twinkle
as
he
watched
her
tony
studied
her
costume
with
an
air
of
concern
you
go
wif
us
signorina
his
expression
was
blended
of
surprise
and
disapproval
but
in
spite
of
himself
his
tone
was
triumphant
you
say
to
me
yesterday

no
want
to
climb

more
mountain

my
mind
but

he
sighed
patiently
then
he
looked
up
and
caught
her
eye
they
both
laughed
signorina
he
whispered
i

bit
giuseppe
rowed
the
three
climbers
a
mile
or
so
down
the
lake
and
set
them
ashore
at
the
base
of
their
mountain
they
started
up
gaily
and
had
accomplished
half
their
journey
before
they
thought
of
being
tired
tony
surpassed
himself
if
he
had
been
entertaining
the
day
before
he
was
doubly
so
now
his
spirits
were
bubbling
over
and
contagious
he
and
constance
acted
like
two
children
out
of
school
they
ran
races
and
talked
to
the
peasants
in
the
wayside
cottages
they
drove
a
herd
of
goats
for
half
a
mile
while
the
goatherd
strolled
behind
and
smoked
tony
cigarettes
constance
took
a
water
jar
from
a
little
girl
they
met
coming
from
the
fountain
and
endeavored
to
balance
it
on
her
own
head
with
the
result
that
she
nearly
drowned
both
herself
and
the
child
they
finally
stopped
for
luncheon
in
a
grove
of
chestnut
trees
with
sheep
nibbling
on
the
hillside
below
them
and
a
shepherd
boy
somewhere
out
of
sight
playing
on
a
mouth
organ
it
should
have
been
a
flute
but
they
were
in
a
forgiving
mood
constance
this
time
did
her
share
of
the
work
she
and
tony
together
spread
the
cloth
and
made
the
coffee
while
her
father
fanned
himself
and
looked
on
if
wilder
had
any
unusual
thoughts
in
regard
to
the
they
were
at
least
not
reflected
in
his
face
when
they
had
finished
their
meal
tony
spread
his
coat
under
a
tree
signorina
he
said
perhaps
you
tired
look
i
make
nice
place
to
sleep
you
lie
down
and
rest
while
ze
signor
papa
and
me
we
have
smoke
zen
after
one
two
hours
i
come
call
you
constance
very
willingly
accepted
the
suggestion
they
had
walked
five
uphill
miles
since
morning
it
was
two
hours
later
that
she
opened
her
eyes
to
find
tony
bending
over
her
she
sat
up
and
regarded
him
sternly
he
had
the
grace
to
blush
tony
did
you
kiss
my
hand
signorina
i
ver
sorry
to
wake
you
but
it
is
tree
and
ze
signor
papa
he
say

one
ver
little
kiss
signorina
constance
assumed
an
air
of
indignant
reproof
but
in
the
midst
of
it
she
laughed
i
wish
you
would
be
so
funny
tony
i
ca
scold
you
as
much
as
you
deserve
but
i
am
angry
just
the
same
and
if

like
that

angry
signorina
i

you
very
angry
for
anysing
as
long
as
i
live
nosing
like
zat
shall
happen
again
no
nevair
i
promise
they
plunged
into
a
pine
wood
and
climbed
for
another
two
hours
the
summit
always
vanishing
before
them
like
a
mirage
at
the
end
of
that
time
they
were
apparently
no
nearer
their
goal
than
when
they
had
started
they
had
followed
first
one
path
then
another
until
they
had
lost
all
sense
of
direction
and
finally
when
they
came
to
a
place
where
three
paths
diverged
they
had
to
acknowledge
themselves
definitely
lost
wilder
elected
one
path
tony
another
and
constance
sat
down
on
a
rock
i
not
going
any
farther
she
observed
you
ca
stay
here
all
night
said
her
father
well
i
ca
walk
over
this
mountain
all
night
we
do
get
anywhere
we
merely
move
in
circles
i
do
think
much
of
the
guide
you
engaged
he
does
know
his
way
he
was
engaged
to
know
his
way
tony
retorted
he
was
engaged
to
wear
earrings
and
sing
santa
lucia
constance
continued
to
sit
on
her
rock
while
tony
went
forward
on
a
reconnoitering
expedition
he
returned
in
ten
minutes
with
the
information
that
there
was
a
shepherd
hut
not
very
far
off
with
a
shepherd
inside
who
would
like
to
be
friendly
if
the
signorina
would
deign
to
ask
some
questions
in
the
italian
language
which
she
spoke
so
fluently
they
could
doubtless
obtain
directions
as
to
the
way
home
they
found
the
shepherd
the
shepherdess
and
four
little
shepherds
eating
their
evening
polenta
in
an
room
with
half
a
dozen
chickens
and
the
family
pig
gathered
about
them
in
an
expectant
group
they
rose
politely
and
invited
the
travellers
to
enter
it
was
an
event
in
their
simple
lives
when
foreigners
presented
themselves
at
the
door
constance
commenced
amenities
by
announcing
that
she
had
been
walking
on
the
mountain
since
sunrise
and
was
starving
did
they
by
chance
have
any
fresh
milk
starving
how
dreadful
madame
held
up
her
hands
but
yes
to
be
sure
they
had
fresh
milk
they
kept
four
cows
that
was
their
business
turning
milk
into
cheese
and
selling
it
on
market
day
in
the
village
also
they
had
some
fresh
mountain
strawberries
which
beppo
had
gathered
that
morning
perhaps
they
too
might
be
pleasing
to
the
signorina
constance
nodded
affirmatively
and
added
with
her
eyes
on
the
pig
that
it
might
be
pleasanter
to
eat
outside
where
they
could
look
at
the
view
she
became
quite
gay
again
over
what
she
termed
their
afternoon
and
her
father
had
to
remind
her
most
insistently
that
if
they
wished
to
get
down
before
darkness
overtook
them
they
must
start
at
once
an
italian
twilight
is
short
they
paid
for
the
food
and
presented
a
lira
apiece
to
the
children
leaving
them
silhouetted
against
the
sky
in
a
bobbing
row
shouting
musical
farewells
their
host
led
them
through
the
woods
and
out
on
to
the
brow
of
the
mountain
in
order
to
start
them
down
by
the
right
path
he
regretted
that
he
could
not
go
all
the
way
but
the
sheep
had
still
to
be
brought
in
for
the
night
at
the
parting
he
was
garrulous
with
directions
the
easiest
way
to
get
home
now
would
be
straight
down
the
mountain
to
grotta
del
monte
he
pointed
out
the
roofs
of
a
village
far
below
them
there
they
could
find
donkeys
or
an
to
take
them
back
it
was
nine
kilometres
to
valedolmo
they
had
come
quite
out
of
their
way
if
they
had
taken
the
right
path
in
the
morning
they
would
have
reached
the
top
where
the
view
was
magnificant
truly
magnificant
it
was
a
pity
to
miss
it
perhaps
some
other
day
they
would
like
to
come
again
and
he
himself
would
be
pleased
to
guide
them
he
shook
hands
and
wished
them
a
pleasant
journey
they
would
best
hurry
a
trifle
he
added
for
darkness
came
fast
and
when
one
got
caught
on
the
mountain
at
night
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
looked
at
tony
one
needed
a
guide
who
knew
his
business
they
had
walked
for
ten
minutes
when
they
heard
someone
shouting
behind
and
found
a
young
man
calling
to
them
to
wait
he
caught
up
with
them
and
breathlessly
explained
pasquale
had
told
him
that
they
were
foreigners
from
america
who
were
climbing
the
mountain
for
diversion
and
who
had
lost
their
way
he
was
going
down
to
the
village
himself
and
would
be
pleased
to
guide
them
he
fell
into
step
beside
constance
and
commenced
asking
questions
while
tony
as
the
path
was
narrow
perforce
fell
behind
occasionally
constance
translated
but
usually
she
laughed
without
translating
and
tony
for
the
twentieth
time
found
himself
hating
the
italian
language
the
young
man
questions
were
refreshingly
ingenuous
he
was
curious
about
america
since
he
was
thinking
he
said
of
becoming
an
american
himself
some
day
he
knew
a
man
once
who
had
gone
to
america
to
live
and
had
made
a
fortune
there
but
yes
a
large
fortune
ten
thousand
lire
in
four
years
perhaps
the
signorina
knew
him
giuseppe
motta
he
lived
in
buenos
aires
and
what
did
it
look
like
america
how
was
it
different
from
italy
constance
described
the
skyscrapers
in
new
york
his
wonder
was
intense
a
building
twenty
stories
high
he
should
hate
to
mount
himself
up
all
those
stairs
were
the
buildings
like
that
in
the
country
too
did
the
shepherds
live
in
houses
twenty
stories
high
oh
no
she
laughed
in
the
country
the
houses
are
just
like
these
only
they
are
made
of
wood
instead
of
stone
of
wood
he
opened
his
eyes
but
signorina
do
they
never
burn
he
had
another
question
to
ask
he
had
been
told
though
of
course
he
did
not
believe
it
that
the
indians
in
america
had
red
skins
constance
nodded
yes
his
eyes
opened
wider
truly
red
like
your
coat
with
a
glance
at
her
scarlet
golf
jacket
not
quite
she
admitted
but
how
it
must
be
diverting
he
sighed
to
travel
the
world
over
and
see
different
things
he
fell
silent
and
trudged
on
beside
her
the
wanderlust
in
his
eyes
it
was
almost
dark
when
they
reached
the
big
arched
gateway
that
led
into
the
village
here
their
ways
parted
and
they
paused
for
farewell
signorina
the
young
man
said
suddenly
take
me
with
you
back
to
america
i
will
prune
your
olive
trees
i
will
tend
your
vines
you
can
leave
me
in
charge
when
you
go
on
your
travels
she
shook
her
head
with
a
laugh
but
i
have
no
vines
i
have
no
olive
trees
you
would
be
homesick
for
italy
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
then
good
bye
you
signorina
will
go
around
the
world
and
see
many
sights
while
i
for
travel
shall
ride
on
a
donkey
to
valedolmo
he
shook
hands
all
around
and
with
the
grace
of
a
prince
accepted
two
of
tony
cigarettes
his
parting
speech
showed
him
a
fatalist
what
will
be
will
be
there
is
a
girl
he
waved
his
hand
vaguely
in
the
direction
of
the
village
if
i
go
to
america
then
i
can
not
stay
behind
and
marry
maria
so
perhaps
it
is
planned
for
the
best
you
will
find
me
signorina
when
next
you
come
to
italy
still
digging
the
ground
in
grotta
del
monte
as
he
swung
away
tony
glanced
after
him
with
a
suggestion
of
malice
then
he
transferred
his
gaze
to
the
empty
gateway
i
see
no
one
else
with
whom
you
can
talk
italian
perhaps
for
ten
minutes
you
will
deign
to
speak
english
with
me
i
am
too
tired
to
talk
she
threw
over
her
shoulder
as
she
followed
her
father
through
the
gate
they
plunged
into
a
tangle
of
tortuous
paved
streets
the
houses
pressing
each
other
as
closely
as
if
there
were
not
all
the
outside
world
to
spread
in
grotta
del
monte
is
built
on
a
slope
and
its
streets
are
in
reality
long
narrow
flights
of
stairs
all
converging
in
the
little
piazza
the
moon
was
not
yet
up
and
aside
from
an
occasional
flickering
light
before
a
madonna
shrine
the
way
was
black
signorina
take
my
arm
i
afraid
maybe
you
fall
tony
voice
was
humbly
persuasive
constance
laughed
and
laid
her
hand
lightly
on
his
arm
tony
dropped
his
own
hand
over
hers
and
held
her
firmly
neither
spoke
until
they
came
to
the
piazza
signorina
he
whispered
you
make
me
ver
happy
tonight
she
drew
her
hand
away
i
tired
tony
i
not
quite
myself
no
signorina
yesterday
i
sink
maybe
you
not
yourself
but
you
ver
good
ver
kind
jus
your
own
self
ze
way
you
ought
to
be
the
piazza
after
the
dark
narrow
streets
that
led
to
it
seemed
bubbling
with
life
the
day
work
was
finished
and
the
evening
play
had
begun
in
the
center
where
a
fountain
splashed
into
a
broad
bowl
groups
of
women
and
girls
with
copper
were
laughing
and
gossiping
as
they
waited
their
turns
one
side
of
the
square
was
flanked
by
the
imposing
façade
of
a
church
with
the
village
saint
on
a
pedestal
in
front
the
other
side
by
a
cheerfully
inviting
osteria
with
tables
and
chairs
set
into
the
street
and
a
glimpse
inside
of
a
blazing
hearth
and
copper
kettles
wilder
headed
in
a
straight
line
for
the
nearest
chair
and
dropped
into
it
with
an
expression
of
permanence
constance
followed
and
they
held
a
colloquy
with
a
bowing
host
he
was
vague
as
to
the
finding
of
carriage
or
donkeys
but
if
they
would
accommodate
themselves
until
after
supper
there
would
be
a
diligence
along
which
would
take
them
back
to
valedolmo
how
soon
will
the
diligence
arrive
asked
constance
the
man
spread
out
his
hands
it
is
due
in
three
quarters
of
an
hour
but
it
may
be
early
and
it
may
be
late
it
arrives
when
god
and
the
driver
wills
in
that
case
she
laughed
we
will
accommodate
ourselves
until
after
supper
and
we
have
appetites
please
bring
everything
you
have
they
supped
on
and
washed
down
with
the
red
wine
of
grotta
del
monte
which
their
host
assured
them
was
famous
through
all
the
country
he
could
not
believe
that
they
had
never
heard
of
it
in
valedolmo
people
sent
for
it
from
far
off
even
from
verona
they
finished
their
supper
and
the
famous
wine
but
there
was
still
no
diligence
the
village
also
had
finished
its
supper
and
was
drifting
in
family
groups
into
the
piazza
the
moon
was
just
showing
above
the
and
its
light
combined
with
the
blazing
braziers
before
the
made
the
square
a
patch
work
of
brilliant
and
black
shadows
from
deep
cut
doorways
constance
sat
up
alertly
and
watched
the
people
crowding
past
across
from
the
inn
an
itinerant
show
had
established
itself
on
a
rudely
improvised
stage
with
two
flaring
torches
which
threw
their
light
half
across
the
piazza
and
turned
the
spray
of
the
fountain
into
an
iridescent
shower
the
gaiety
of
the
scene
was
contagious
constance
rose
insistently
come
dad
let
go
over
and
see
what
they
doing
no
thank
you
my
dear
i
prefer
my
chair
oh
dad
you
so
phlegmatic
but
i
thought
you
were
tired
i
not
any
more
i
want
to
see
the
you
come
then
tony
tony
rose
with
an
elaborate
sigh
as
you
please
signorina
he
murmured
obediently
an
onlooker
would
have
thought
constance
cruel
in
dragging
him
away
from
his
rest
they
made
their
way
across
the
piazza
and
mounted
the
church
steps
behind
the
crowd
where
they
could
look
across
obliquely
to
the
little
stage
a
clown
was
dancing
to
the
music
of
a
while
a
woman
in
a
tawdry
pink
satin
evening
gown
beat
an
accompaniment
on
a
drum
it
was
a
very
poor
play
with
very
poor
players
and
yet
it
represented
to
these
people
of
grotta
del
monte
something
of
life
of
the
big
outside
world
which
they
in
their
little
village
would
never
see
their
upturned
faces
touched
by
the
moonlight
and
the
flare
of
the
torches
contained
a
look
of
wondering
eagerness
the
same
look
that
had
been
in
the
eyes
of
the
young
peasant
when
he
had
begged
to
be
taken
to
america
the
two
stood
back
in
the
shadow
of
the
doorway
watching
the
people
with
the
same
interest
that
the
people
were
expending
on
the
stage
a
child
had
been
lifted
to
the
base
of
the
saint
pedestal
in
order
to
see
and
in
the
excitement
of
a
duel
between
two
clowns
he
suddenly
lost
his
balance
and
toppled
off
his
mother
snatched
him
up
quickly
and
commenced
covering
the
hurt
arm
with
kisses
to
make
it
well
constance
laughed
is
it
queer
she
asked
to
think
how
different
these
people
are
from
us
and
yet
how
exactly
the
same
their
way
of
living
is
absolutely
foreign
but
their
feelings
are
just
like
yours
and
mine
he
touched
her
arm
and
called
her
attention
to
a
man
and
a
girl
on
the
step
below
them
it
was
the
young
peasant
again
who
had
guided
them
down
the
mountain
but
who
now
had
eyes
for
no
one
but
maria
she
leaned
toward
him
to
see
the
stage
and
his
arm
was
around
her
their
interest
in
the
play
was
purely
a
pretense
and
both
of
them
knew
it
tony
laughed
softly
and
echoed
her
words
yes
their
feelings
are
just
like
yours
and
mine
he
slipped
his
arm
around
her
constance
drew
back
quickly
i
think
she
remarked
that
the
diligence
has
come
oh
hang
the
diligence
tony
growled
why
could
it
have
been
five
minutes
late
they
returned
to
the
inn
to
find
wilder
already
on
the
front
seat
and
obligingly
holding
the
reins
while
the
driver
occupied
himself
with
a
glass
of
the
famous
wine
the
diligence
was
a
roomy
affair
of
four
seats
and
three
horses
behind
the
driver
were
three
italians
gesticulating
violently
over
local
politics
a
new
was
imminent
behind
these
were
three
nuns
covertly
interested
in
the
woman
in
the
pink
evening
gown
and
behind
the
three
occupying
the
exact
center
of
the
rear
seat
was
a
fourth
nun
with
the
portly
bearing
of
a
mother
superior
she
was
very
comfortable
as
she
was
and
did
not
propose
to
move
constance
climbed
up
on
one
side
of
her
and
tony
on
the
other
we
are
well
chaperoned
he
grumbled
as
they
jolted
out
of
the
piazza
i
always
did
think
that
the
church
interfered
too
much
with
the
rights
of
individuals
constance
in
a
spirit
of
friendly
expansiveness
proceeded
to
pick
up
an
acquaintance
with
the
nuns
and
the
four
black
heads
were
presently
bobbing
in
unison
while
tony
in
gloomy
isolation
at
his
end
of
the
seat
folded
his
arms
and
stared
at
the
road
the
driver
had
passed
through
many
villages
that
day
and
had
drunk
many
glasses
of
famous
wine
he
cracked
his
whip
and
sang
as
he
drove
they
rattled
in
and
out
of
villages
along
open
stretches
of
moonlit
road
past
villas
and
olive
groves
children
screamed
after
them
dogs
barked
constance
and
her
four
nuns
were
very
vivacious
and
tony
gloom
deepened
with
every
mile
they
had
covered
three
quarters
of
the
distance
when
the
diligence
was
brought
to
a
halt
before
a
high
stone
wall
and
a
solid
barred
gate
the
nuns
came
back
to
the
present
with
an
excited
cackling
who
would
believe
they
had
reached
the
convent
so
soon
they
made
their
adieus
and
ponderously
descended
their
departure
accelerated
by
tony
who
had
become
of
a
sudden
alertly
helpful
as
they
started
again
he
slid
along
into
the
mother
superior
empty
seat
what
were
we
saying
when
the
diligence
interrupted
he
inquired
i
do
remember
tony
but
i
do
want
to
talk
any
more
i
tired
you
tired
signorina
lay
your
head
on
my
shoulder
and
go
to
sleep
tony
behave
yourself
i
simply
too
tired
to
make
you
do
it
he
reached
over
and
took
her
hand
she
did
not
try
to
withdraw
it
for
two
three
minutes
then
she
shot
him
a
sidewise
glance
tony
she
said
do
you
think
you
are
forgetting
your
place
no
signorina
i
am
just
learning
it
let
go
my
hand
he
gazed
pensively
at
the
moon
and
hummed
santa
lucia
under
his
breath
tony
i
shall
be
angry
with
you
i
shall
be
ver
sorry
for
zat
signorina
i
do
not
wish
to
make
you
angry
but
i
sink

over
it

behaving
abominably
today
tony
i
shall
never
stay
alone
with
you

ver
bright
when
i
look
at
zat
moon

always
beautiful
toughts
about
how
much

costantina
an
interval
followed
during
which
neither
spoke
the
driver
song
was
growing
louder
and
the
horses
were
galloping
the
diligence
suddenly
rounded
a
curved
cliff
on
two
wheels
constance
lurched
against
him
he
caught
her
and
held
her
her
lips
were
very
near
his
he
kissed
her
softly
she
moved
to
the
far
end
of
the
seat
and
faced
him
with
flushed
cheeks
i
thought
you
were
a
gentleman
i
used
to
be
signorina
now
i
am
only
poor
i
shall
never
speak
to
you
again
you

climb
as
many
mountains
as
you
wish
with
my
father
but
you
ca
have
anything
more
to
do
with
me
signorina
i
i
did
not
mean
to
it
was
just
an
accident
signorina
constance
turned
her
back
and
stared
at
the
road
it
was
not
my
fault
truly
it
was
not
my
fault
i
did
not
wish
to
kiss
you
no
nevair
but
i
could
not
help
it
you
put
your
head
too
close
she
raised
her
eyes
and
studied
the
signorina
why
you
treat
me
so
cruel
her
back
was
inflexible
i
am
desolate
if
you
forgive
me
zis
once
i
will
nevair
again
do
a
sing
so
wicked
nevair
nevair
nevair
constance
continued
her
inspection
of
the
tony
leaned
forward
until
he
could
see
her
face
signorina
he
whispered
jus
give
me
one
smile
to
show
me
you
are
not
angry
forever
the
stage
had
stopped
and
wilder
was
climbing
down
but
gaze
was
still
fixed
on
the
sky
and
tony
eyes
were
on
her
what
the
matter
constance
have
you
gone
to
sleep
are
you
going
to
get
out
she
came
back
with
a
start
are
we
here
already
there
was
a
suspicion
of
regret
in
her
tone
which
did
not
escape
tony
at
the
villa
rosa
gates
he
wished
them
a
humbly
deferential
but
with
a
smile
hovering
about
the
corners
of
his
mouth
constance
made
no
response
as
he
strode
off
however
she
turned
her
head
and
looked
after
him
he
turned
too
and
caught
her
he
waved
his
hand
with
a
laugh
and
took
up
his
way
whistling
santa
lucia
in
double
time
chapter
xiii
three
days
passed
in
which
wilder
and
tony
industriously
climbed
and
in
which
nothing
of
consequence
passed
between
constance
and
tony
if
she
happened
to
be
about
when
the
expeditions
either
started
or
came
to
an
end
and
for
one
reason
or
another
she
usually
was
she
ignored
him
entirely
and
he
ignored
her
except
for
an
occasional
mockingly
deferential
bow
he
appeared
to
extract
as
much
pleasure
from
the
excursions
as
wilder
and
he
asked
for
no
extra
compensation
by
the
way
it
was
tuesday
again
just
a
week
and
a
day
since
the
young
american
had
dropped
over
the
wall
of
villa
rosa
asking
for
the
garden
of
the
prince
tony
and
wilder
were
off
on
a
trip
miss
hazel
and
constance
on
the
point
of
sitting
down
to
afternoon
tea
there
were
no
guests
today
when
the
gardener
from
the
hotel
du
lac
appeared
with
a
message
from
nannie
hilliard
she
and
her
aunt
had
arrived
half
an
hour
before
which
was
a
good
two
days
earlier
than
they
were
due
constance
read
the
note
with
a
clouded
brow
and
silently
passed
it
to
miss
hazel
the
news
was
not
so
entirely
welcome
as
under
other
circumstances
it
would
have
been
nannie
hilliard
was
both
perspicacious
and
fascinating
and
constance
foresaw
that
her
presence
would
tangle
further
the
already
tangled
plot
of
the
little
comedy
which
was
unfolding
itself
at
villa
rosa
but
miss
hazel
divining
nothing
of
comedies
or
plots
was
thrown
into
a
pleasant
flutter
by
the
news
guests
were
a
luxury
which
occurred
but
seldom
in
the
quiet
monotony
of
valedolmo
we
must
call
on
them
at
once
and
bring
them
back
to
the
house
i
suppose
we
must
constance
agreed
with
an
uncordial
sigh
fifteen
minutes
later
they
were
on
their
way
to
the
hotel
du
lac
while
elizabetta
on
her
knees
in
the
villa
was
vigorously
scrubbing
the
mosaic
floor
gustavo
hurried
out
to
meet
them
he
was
plainly
in
a
flutter
something
had
occurred
to
upset
the
usual
suavity
of
his
manners
signorina
in
ze
garden
ze
two
american
ladies
having
tea
and
you
are
acquaint
wif
ze
family
all
ze
time
you
are
acquaint
wif
zem
and
you
never
tell
me
there
was
mystification
and
reproach
in
his
tone
constance
eyed
him
with
a
degree
of
mystification
on
her
side
i
am
acquainted
with
a
number
of
families
that
i
have
never
told
you
about
she
observed
signorina
he
stammered
and
immediately
tony
zat
what

climbing
monte
brione
today
what
time

ze
signorina
zay

two
days
before

he
was
clearly
aggrieved
by
the
fact
constance
mystification
increased
she
saw
not
the
slightest
connection
i
suppose
gustavo
you
can
find
them
something
to
eat
even
if
they
did
come
two
days
before
they
were
expected
the
two
turned
toward
the
arbor
but
constance
paused
for
a
moment
and
glanced
back
with
a
shade
of
mischief
in
her
eye
by
the
way
gustavo
that
young
man
who
taught
the
parrot
english
has
gone
gustavo
rolled
his
eyes
to
the
sky
and
back
to
her
face
she
understood
nothing
was
there
ever
a
muddle
like
this
signorina
he
murmured
confusedly
ze
yong
man
is
gone
nannie
caught
sight
of
the
visitors
first
and
with
a
start
which
nearly
upset
the
tea
table
came
running
forward
to
meet
them
while
her
aunt
eustace
followed
more
placidly
nannie
was
a
big
wholesome
outdoor
girl
of
a
purely
american
type
she
waited
for
no
greetings
she
had
news
to
impart
constance
miss
hazel
i
so
glad
to
see
you
what
do
you
think
engaged
miss
hazel
murmured
incoherent
congratulations
and
tried
not
to
look
as
shocked
as
she
felt
in
her
day
no
lady
would
have
made
so
delicate
an
announcement
in
any
such
manner
as
this
constance
received
it
in
the
spirit
in
which
it
was
given
who
the
man
she
inquired
as
she
shook
hands
with
eustace
illustration
nannie
caught
sight
of
the
visitors
first
and
came
running
forward
to
meet
them
you
do
know
him
harry
eastman
a
friend
of
jerry
jerry
know
it
yet
and
i
had
to
confide
in
someone
oh
it
no
secret
harry
cabled
home
he
wanted
to
get
it
announced
so
i
could
change
my
mind
you
see
he
only
had
a
three
weeks
vacation
he
took
a
fast
boat
landed
at
cherbourg
followed
us
the
whole
length
of
france
and
caught
us
in
lucerne
just
after
jerry
had
gone
i
could
refuse
him
after
taken
such
a
lot
of
trouble
that
what
detained
us
we
had
expected
to
come
a
week
ago
and
now
by
a
rapid
change
of
expression
she
became
tragic
we
lost
jerry
junior
lost
jerry
junior
constance
tone
was
interested
what
has
become
of
him
we
have
an
idea
he
been
spirited
off
vanished
from
the
earth
and
left
no
trace
really
we
beginning
to
be
afraid
he
been
captured
by
brigands
that
head
waiter
that
gustavo
knows
where
he
is
but
we
get
a
word
out
of
him
he
tells
a
different
story
every
ten
minutes
i
looked
in
the
register
to
see
if
by
chance
he
left
an
address
there
and
what
do
you
think
i
found
oh
said
constance
there
was
a
world
of
illumination
in
her
tone
what
did
you
find
she
asked
hastily
suppressing
every
emotion
but
polite
curiosity
lincoln
in
jerry
really
constance
dimpled
irrepressibly
you
are
sure
jerry
wrote
it
it
was
his
writing
and
i
showed
it
to
gustavo
and
what
do
you
think
he
said
constance
shook
her
head
he
said
that
jerry
had
forgotten
to
register
that
that
was
written
by
a
hungarian
nobleman
who
was
here
last
week
imagine
a
hungarian
nobleman
named
abraham
lincoln
constance
dropped
into
one
of
the
little
iron
chairs
and
bowed
her
head
on
the
back
and
laughed
perhaps
you
can
explain
there
was
a
touch
of
sharpness
in
tone
do
ever
ask
me
to
explain
anything
gustavo
says
the
man
is
not
to
be
believed
under
oath
but
what
become
of
jerry
oh
he
turn
up
constance
tone
was
comforting
aunt
hazel
she
called
miss
hazel
and
eustace
their
heads
together
over
the
tea
table
were
busily
making
up
three
months
dropped
news
do
you
remember
the
young
man
i
told
you
about
who
popped
into
our
garden
last
week
that
was
jerry
junior
then
you
seen
him
said
nannie
constance
related
the
episode
of
the
broken
wall
the
sequel
she
omitted
i
had
seen
him
for
six
years
she
added
apologetically
and
i
did
recognize
him
of
course
if
i
dreamed
nannie
groaned
and
i
thought
i
planned
it
so
beautifully
planned
what
i
suppose
i
might
as
well
tell
you
since
it
come
to
nothing
we
hoped
that
is
you
see
i
been
so
worried
for
fear
jerry
she
took
a
breath
and
began
again
you
know
constance
when
it
comes
to
getting
married
a
man
has
no
more
sense
than
a
child
so
i
determined
to
pick
out
a
wife
for
jerry
myself
one
i
would
like
to
have
for
a
sister
i
done
it
three
times
and
he
simply
would
look
at
them
you
ca
imagine
how
stubborn
he
is
but
when
i
found
we
were
coming
to
valedolmo
i
said
to
myself
now
this
is
my
opportunity
i
will
have
him
marry
connie
wilder
you
might
have
asked
my
permission
oh
well
jerry
a
dear
next
to
harry
you
could
find
anyone
nicer
but
i
knew
the
only
way
was
not
to
let
him
suspect
i
thought
you
see
that
you
were
still
staying
at
the
hotel
i
did
know
you
taken
a
villa
so
i
planned
for
him
to
come
to
meet
us
three
days
before
we
really
expected
to
get
here
i
thought
in
the
meantime
being
stranded
together
in
a
little
hotel
you
surely
get
acquainted
jerry
very
resourceful
that
way
and
with
all
this
beautiful
italian
scenery
about
and
nothing
to
do
i
see
constance
tone
was
somewhat
dry
but
nothing
happened
as
i
had
planned
you
were
here
he
was
bored
to
death
and
i
was
detained
longer
than
i
meant
we
got
the
most
pathetic
letter
from
him
the
second
day
saying
there
was
no
one
but
the
head
waiter
to
talk
to
nothing
but
an
tree
to
look
at
and
if
we
did
come
immediately
he
do
the
dolomites
without
us
then
finally
just
as
we
were
on
the
point
of
leaving
he
sent
a
telegram
saying
come
am
climbing
mountains
stay
there
till
you
hear
from
me
but
being
already
packed
we
came
and
this
is
what
we
find
she
waved
her
hand
over
the
empty
grove
it
serves
you
right
you
should
deceive
people
it
was
for
jerry
good
and
yours
too
but
what
shall
we
do
he
know
we
here
and
he
has
left
no
address
come
out
to
the
villa
and
visit
us
till
he
comes
to
search
for
you
constance
could
hear
her
aunt
delivering
the
same
invitation
to
eustace
and
she
perforce
repeated
it
though
with
the
inward
hope
that
it
would
be
declined
she
had
no
wish
that
tony
and
her
father
should
return
from
their
trip
to
find
a
family
party
assembled
on
the
terrace
the
adventure
was
not
to
end
with
any
such
tame
climax
as
that
to
her
relief
they
did
decline
at
least
for
the
night
they
could
make
no
definite
plans
until
they
had
heard
from
jerry
constance
rose
upon
this
assurance
and
precipitated
their
she
did
not
wish
her
aunt
to
press
them
to
change
their
minds
eustace
nannie
we
be
around
tonight
to
take
you
sailing
provided
there
any
breeze
she
nodded
and
dragged
her
aunt
off
but
as
they
were
entering
the
arbor
a
plan
for
further
complicating
matters
popped
into
her
head
and
she
turned
back
to
call
you
are
coming
to
the
villa
tomorrow
remember
whether
jerry
junior
turns
up
or
not
i
write
a
note
and
invite
him
too
gustavo

give
it
to
him
when
he
comes
and
you
need
bother
any
more
about
him
they
found
gustavo
hovering
omnivorously
in
the
courtyard
hungering
for
news
constance
summoned
him
to
her
side
gustavo
i
am
going
to
send
you
a
note
tonight
for
jerymn
hilliard
you
will
see
that

certainly
i

for
six
years
do

the
note

they
raised
their
parasols
and
departed
while
gustavo
stood
in
the
gateway
bowing
the
motion
was
purely
mechanical
his
thoughts
were
laboring
elsewhere
chapter
xiv
constance
occupied
herself
upon
their
return
to
villa
rosa
in
writing
the
letter
to
jerry
junior
it
had
occurred
to
her
that
this
was
an
excellent
chance
to
punish
him
and
it
was
the
working
philosophy
of
her
life
that
a
man
should
always
be
punished
when
opportunity
presented
tony
had
been
entirely
too
unconcerned
during
the
past
few
days
he
needed
a
lesson
she
spent
three
quarters
of
an
hour
in
composing
her
letter
and
tore
up
two
false
starts
before
she
was
satisfied
it
did
not
contain
the
slightest
hint
that
she
knew
the
truth
and
considered
in
this
light
it
was
likely
to
have
a
chastening
effect
the
letter
ran

dear
jerry
junior
i
hope
you
do
mind
being
called
jerry
junior
but
hilliard
sounds
so
absurdly
formal
when
i
have
known
your
sister
so
long
and
so
well
we
are
spending
the
summer
here
in
valedolmo
and
eustace
and
nannie
have
promised
to
stop
with
us
for
a
few
days
provided
you
can
be
persuaded
to
pause
in
your
mad
rush
through
europe
now
please
take
pity
on
us
guests
are
such
unusual
luxuries
and
as
for
besides
a
passing
tourist
or
so
we
have
had
nothing
but
italian
officers
you
can
climb
mountains
with
my
father
nan
says
you
are
a
climber
and
we
can
supply
mountains
enough
to
keep
you
occupied
for
a
month
my
father
would
write
himself
only
that
he
is
climbing
this
moment
yours
most
cordially
constance
wilder
i
forgot
to
mention
that
we
are
acquainted
already
you
and
i
we
met
six
years
ago
and
you
insulted
me
under
your
own
roof
you
called
me
a
i
shall
accept
nothing
but
a
personal
apology
having
read
it
critically
she
sealed
and
addressed
it
with
malicious
delight
it
was
calculated
to
arouse
just
about
the
emotions
she
would
like
to
have
tony
entertain
she
gave
the
note
to
giuseppe
with
instructions
to
place
it
in
gustavo
hands
and
then
settled
herself
gaily
to
await
results
giuseppe
was
barely
out
of
sight
when
the
two
appeared
at
the
gate
constance
had
been
wondering
how
she
could
inform
tony
that
his
aunt
and
sister
had
arrived
without
unbending
from
the
dignified
silence
of
the
past
three
days
the
obvious
method
was
to
announce
it
to
her
father
in
tony
presence
but
her
father
slipped
into
the
house
by
the
back
way
without
affording
her
an
opportunity
it
was
tony
himself
who
solved
the
difficulty
of
his
own
accord
he
crossed
the
terrace
and
approached
her
side
he
laid
a
bunch
of
edelweiss
on
the
balustrade
it
a
peace
offering
he
observed
she
looked
at
him
a
moment
without
speaking
there
was
a
new
expression
in
her
eyes
that
puzzled
tony
just
as
the
expression
in
his
eyes
that
morning
on
the
water
had
puzzled
her
she
was
studying
him
in
the
light
of
jerry
junior
the
likeness
to
the
sophomore
who
six
years
before
sang
the
funny
songs
without
a
smile
was
so
very
striking
she
wondered
she
could
ever
have
overlooked
it
thank
you
tony
it
is
very
nice
of
you
she
picked
up
the
flowers
and
smiled
with
the
knowledge
of
the
letter
that
was
waiting
for
him
she
could
afford
to
be
forgiving
you
discharged
me
signorina
will
you
take
me
back
into
your
service
i
am
not
going
to
climb
any
more
mountains
it
is
too
fatiguing
i
think
it
is
better
for
you
and
my
father
to
go
alone
i
will
serve
you
in
other
ways
constance
studied
the
mountains
a
moment
should
she
tell
him
she
knew
or
should
she
keep
up
the
pretense
a
little
longer
her
insatiable
love
of
intrigue
won
are
you
sure
you
wish
to
be
taken
back
signorina
i
am
very
sure
then
perhaps
you
will
do
me
a
favor
on
your
way
home

but
to
ask
i
wish
to
send
a

of
anxiety

same
signorina
which

your
questions

too
personal
tony
he
folded
his
arms
and
sighed
will
you
deliver
my
message
signorina
wif
pleasure
there
was
not
a
trace
of
curiosity
in
his
expression
nothing
beyond
a
deferential
desire
to
serve
tell
him
tony
that
miss
wilder
will
be
at
home
tomorrow
afternoon
at
tea
time
if
he
will

the
gate
and

she
will
be
most
pleased
to
see
him
she
wishes
him
to
meet
an
american
friend
a
miss
hilliard
who
has
just
arrived
at
the
hotel
this
afternoon
she
watched
him
sharply
his
expression
did
not
alter
by
a
shade
he
repeated
the
message
and
then
added
as
if
by
the
merest
chance
ze
yong
american
man
signorina
you
know
his
name
yes
i
know
his
name
this
time
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
she
surprised
a
look
his
name
she
hesitated
tantalizingly
is
signor
abraham
lincoln
signor
he
repeated
it
after
her
as
if
committing
it
to
memory
they
gazed
at
each
other
soberly
a
moment
then
both
laughed
and
looked
away
luigi
had
appeared
in
the
doorway
seeing
no
one
more
important
than
tony
about
he
found
no
reason
for
delaying
the
announcement
of
dinner
pranzo
è
sulla
tavola
said
constance
over
her
shoulder
she
turned
back
to
tony
her
manner
was
kind
if
you
go
to
the
kitchen
tony
elizabetta
will
give
you
some
dinner
sank
you
signorina
his
manner
was
humble
elizabetta
dinners
consist
of
a
plate
of
garlic
and
macaroni
on
the
kitchen
steps
i
like
garlic
and
i
tired
of
macaroni
if

the
same
to
you
i
think

he
held
out
his
hand
she
read
his
purpose
in
his
eye
and
put
her
own
hands
behind
her
you
wo
shake

and

she
laughed
and
nodded
and
turned
away
on
the
steps
she
paused
to
add
be
sure
not
to
forget
the
message
for
signor
abraham
lincoln
i
shall
be
disappointed
if
he
does
come
chapter
xv
tony
returned
to
the
hotel
du
lac
modestly
by
the
back
way
he
assured
himself
that
his
aunt
and
sister
were
well
by
means
of
an
open
window
in
the
rear
of
the
the
window
was
shaded
by
a
clump
of
camellias
and
he
studied
at
his
ease
the
back
of
head
and
nannie
vivacious
profile
as
she
talked
in
fluent
and
execrable
german
to
the
two
alpinists
who
were
at
the
moment
the
only
other
guests
brotherly
affection
and
a
humorous
desire
to
create
a
sensation
prompted
him
to
walk
in
and
surprise
them
but
saner
second
thoughts
prevailed
he
decided
to
postpone
the
reunion
until
he
should
have
changed
from
the
picturesque
costume
of
tony
to
the
soberer
garb
of
jerry
junior
he
skirted
the
by
a
wide
detour
and
entered
the
at
the
side
gustavo
who
for
the
last
hour
and
a
half
had
been
alertly
watchful
of
four
entrances
at
once
pounced
upon
him
and
drew
him
to
a
corner
signore
in
a
conspiratorial
whisper
zay
are
come
ze
aunt
and
ze
sister
i
know
the
signorina
costantina
told
me
so
gustavo
blinked
but
signore
she
does
not
know
it
yes
she
does
she
saw
herself
i
mean
signore
she
does
not
know
zat

ze
brover
oh
no
she
does
know
that
but
she
tell
me
zat
she
is
acquaint
wif
ze
brover
for
six
years
he
shook
his
head
hopelessly
that
all
right
tony
patted
his
shoulder
reassuringly
when
she
knew
me
i
used
to
have
yellow
hair
but
i
thought
it
made
me
look
too
girlish
so
i
had
it
dyed
black
she
did
recognize
me
gustavo
accepted
the
explanation
with
a
side
glance
at
the
hair
now
pay
attention
tony
tone
was
slow
and
distinct
i
am
going
upstairs
to
change
my
clothes
then
i
will
slip
out
the
back
way
with
a
suit
case
and
go
down
the
road
and
meet
the
omnibus
as
it
comes
back
from
the
boat
landing
you
keep
my
aunt
and
sister
in
the
talking
to
the
parrot
or
something
until
the
omnibus
arrives
then
when
i
get
out
you
come
forward
with
your
politest
bow
and
ask
me
if
i
want
a
room
i
attend
to
the
rest
do
you
understand
gustavo
nodded
with
glistening
eyes
he
had
always
felt
stirring
within
him
powers
for
diplomacy
for
finesse
and
he
rose
to
the
occasion
magnificently
tony
turned
away
and
went
bounding
upstairs
two
steps
at
a
time
chuckling
as
he
went
he
too
was
developing
an
undreamed
of
appetite
for
intrigue
and
his
capacity
in
that
direction
was
expanding
to
meet
it
he
had
covered
the
first
flight
when
gustavo
suddenly
remembered
the
letter
and
bounded
after
signore
i
beg
of
you
to
wait
one
moment
here
is
a
letter
from
ze
signorina
it
is
come
while
you
are
away
tony
read
the
address
with
a
start
of
surprise
then
she
knows
there
was
regret
disillusionment
in
his
tone
it
was
gustavo
turn
to
furnish
enlightenment
but
no
signore
she
do
not
comprehend
she
sink
meestair
jayreem
ailyar
is
ze
brover
who
is
not
arrive
she
leave
it
for
him
when
he
come
ah
tony
ripped
it
open
and
read
it
through
with
a
chuckle
he
read
it
a
second
time
and
his
face
grew
grave
he
thrust
it
into
his
pocket
and
strode
away
without
a
word
for
gustavo
gustavo
looked
after
him
reproachfully
as
a
head
waiter
he
naturally
did
not
expect
to
read
the
letters
of
guests
but
as
a
fellow
conspirator
he
felt
that
he
was
entitled
to
at
least
a
general
knowledge
of
all
matters
bearing
on
the
conspiracy
he
turned
back
down
stairs
with
a
disappointed
droop
to
his
shoulders
tony
closed
his
door
and
walked
to
the
window
where
he
stood
staring
at
the
roof
of
villa
rosa
he
drew
the
letter
from
his
pocket
and
read
it
for
the
third
time
slowly
thoughtfully
very
very
soberly
the
reason
was
clear
she
was
tired
of
tony
and
was
looking
ahead
for
fresh
worlds
to
conquer
jerry
junior
was
to
come
next
he
understood
why
she
had
been
so
complaisant
today
she
wished
the
curtain
to
go
down
on
the
comedy
note
tomorrow
the
nameless
young
american
the
abraham
lincoln
of
the
register
would
call
by
the
gate
would
be
received
graciously
introduced
in
his
proper
person
to
the
guests
the
story
of
the
would
be
recounted
and
laughed
over
and
he
would
be
politely
asked
when
he
was
planning
to
resume
his
travels
this
would
be
the
end
of
the
episode
to
constance
it
had
been
merely
an
amusing
farce
about
which
she
could
boast
when
she
returned
to
america
in
her
vivacious
style
it
would
make
a
story
just
as
her
first
meeting
with
jerry
junior
had
made
a
story
but
as
for
the
play
itself
for
she
cared
nothing
tony
the
man
had
made
no
impression
he
must
pass
on
and
give
place
to
jerry
junior
a
flush
crept
over
tony
face
and
his
mouth
took
a
straighter
line
as
he
continued
to
gaze
down
on
the
roof
of
villa
rosa
his
reflections
were
presently
interrupted
by
a
knock
he
turned
and
threw
the
door
open
with
a
fling
well
he
inquired
gustavo
took
a
step
backward
signore
but
zay
are
eating
ze
dessart
and
in
five
ten
minutes
ze
omnibus
will
arrive
the
omnibus
tony
stared
oh
he
laughed
shortly
i
was
just
joking
gustavo
gustavo
bowed
and
turned
down
the
corridor
there
was
a
look
on
face
that
did
not
encourage
confidences
he
had
not
gone
half
a
dozen
steps
however
when
the
door
opened
again
and
tony
called
him
back
i
am
going
away
tomorrow
morning
by
the
first
boat
this
time
and
you
must
let
my
aunt
and
sister
know
i
will
write
two
letters
and
you
are
to
take
them
down
to
the
steward
of
the
boat
that
leaves
tonight
ask
him
to
put
on
austrian
stamps
and
mail
them
at
riva
so
they
get
back
here
tomorrow
do
you
understand
gustavo
nodded
and
backed
away
his
disappointment
this
time
was
too
keen
for
words
he
saw
stretching
before
him
a
future
like
the
past
monotonously
bereft
of
plots
and
masquerades
tony
having
hit
on
a
plan
sat
down
and
put
it
into
instant
execution
opening
his
baedeker
he
turned
to
riva
and
picked
out
the
first
hotel
that
was
mentioned
then
he
wrote
two
letters
both
short
and
to
the
point
he
indulged
in
none
of
constance
vacillations
and
yet
in
their
way
his
letters
also
were
masterpieces
of
illusion
the
first
was
addressed
to
miss
constance
wilder
at
villa
rosa
it
ran
hotel
sole
riva
austria
dear
miss

would
give
me
greater
pleasure

valedolmo
but
unfortunately

am
pressed
for
time
and
am
engaged
to
start
thursday
morning
with
some
friends
on
a
trip
through

trusting
that
i
may
have
the
pleasure
of
making
your
acquaintance
at
some
future
date
yours
truly
jerymn
hilliard
the
second
letter
was
addressed
to
his
sister
but
he
trusted
to
luck
that
constance
would
see
it

sorry
to
hurry

but
you
know
my
vacation
does
last
forever
love
to
aunt
kate
and
yourself
yours
ever
jerry
he
turned
the
letters
over
to
gustavo
with
a
note
leaving
gustavo
to
decide
with
his
own
conscience
whether
the
money
was
intended
for
himself
or
the
steward
of
the
regina
margarita
this
accomplished
he
slipped
out
unobtrusively
and
took
the
road
toward
villa
rosa
he
strode
along
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
eyes
on
the
path
until
he
nearly
bumped
his
nose
against
the
villa
then
he
stopped
and
thought
he
had
no
mind
to
be
ushered
to
the
terrace
where
he
would
have
to
dissemble
some
excuse
for
his
visit
before
miss
hazel
and
wilder
his
business
tonight
was
with
constance
and
constance
alone
he
turned
and
skirted
the
villa
wall
determined
on
reconnoitering
first
there
was
a
place
in
the
wall
he
knew
well
where
the
stones
were
missing
and
a
view
was
obtainable
of
the
terrace
and
parapet
he
reached
the
place
to
find
lieutenant
carlo
di
ferara
already
there
now
the
lieutenant
purpose
was
exactly
as
innocent
as
tony
own
he
merely
wished
to
assure
himself
that
captain
coroloni
was
not
before
him
it
was
considered
a
joke
at
the
tenth
cavalry
mess
to
detail
one
or
the
other
of
the
officers
to
call
on
the
americans
at
the
same
time
that
lieutenant
di
ferara
called
he
was
not
spying
on
the
family
merely
on
his
meddling
brother
officers
tony
of
course
could
know
nothing
of
this
and
as
his
eyes
fell
upon
the
lieutenant
there
was
apparent
in
their
depths
a
large
measure
of
contempt
a
lieutenant
in
the
royal
italian
cavalry
can
afford
to
be
generous
in
many
things
but
he
can
not
afford
to
swallow
contempt
from
a
the
signorina
was
not
present
this
time
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
not
punish
the
fellow
he
dropped
his
hand
on
shoulder
on
his
collar
to
be
exact
and
whirled
him
about
the
action
was
accompanied
by
some
vigorous
colloquial
italian
the
gist
of
it
being
that
tony
was
to
mind
his
own
business
and
mend
his
manners
the
lieutenant
had
a
muscular
arm
and
tony
turned
but
tony
had
not
played
quarterback
four
years
for
nothing
he
tackled
low
and
the
next
moment
the
lieutenant
was
rolling
down
the
bank
of
a
dried
stream
that
stretched
at
their
feet
no
one
likes
to
roll
down
a
dusty
stony
bank
much
less
an
officer
in
immaculate
uniform
on
the
eve
of
paying
a
formal
call
upon
ladies
he
picked
himself
up
and
looked
at
tony
he
was
quite
beyond
speech
tony
looked
back
and
smiled
he
swept
off
his
hat
with
a
deferential
bow
he
murmured
and
jumped
over
the
wall
into
the
grounds
of
villa
rosa
the
lieutenant
gasped
if
anything
could
have
been
more
insultingly
inadequate
to
the
situation
than
that
one
word
it
did
not
at
the
moment
occur
to
him
jeering
blasphemy
vituperation
he
might
have
excused
but
this
the
shock
jostled
him
back
to
a
thinking
state
here
was
no
ordinary
the
hand
that
had
rested
for
a
moment
on
his
arm
was
the
hand
of
a
gentleman
the
man
face
was
vaguely
elusively
familiar
if
the
lieutenant
had
not
seen
him
before
he
had
at
least
seen
his
picture
the
man
had
pretended
he
could
not
talk
italian
but
it
came
out
very
pat
when
it
was
needed
an
idea
suddenly
assailed
lieutenant
di
ferara
he
scrambled
up
the
bank
and
skirted
the
wall
almost
on
a
run
until
he
reached
the
place
where
his
horse
was
tied
two
minutes
later
he
was
off
at
a
gallop
headed
for
the
house
of
the
prefect
of
police
of
valedolmo
chapter
xvi
tony
jumped
over
the
wall
he
might
have
landed
in
the
midst
of
a
family
party
but
in
so
much
luck
was
with
him
he
found
the
bobbing
at
the
foot
of
the
water
steps
with
wilder
and
miss
hazel
already
embarked
they
were
waiting
for
constance
who
had
obligingly
run
back
to
the
house
to
fetch
the
rainbow
shawl
finished
that
afternoon
as
miss
hazel
distrusted
the
italian
night
breeze
constance
stepped
out
from
the
door
as
tony
emerged
from
the
bushes
she
regarded
him
in
startled
surprise
he
was
still
in
some
slight
disarray
from
his
encounter
with
the
lieutenant
may
i
speak
to
you
miss
wilder
i
wo
detain
you
but
a
moment
she
nodded
and
kept
on
her
heart
thumping
absurdly
he
had
received
the
letter
of
course
and
there
would
be
consequences
she
paused
at
the
top
of
the
water
steps
you
go
on
she
called
to
the
others
and
pick
me
up
on
your
way
back
tony
wants
to
see
me
about
something
and
i
do
like
to
keep
eustace
and
nannie
waiting
giuseppe
pushed
off
and
constance
was
left
standing
alone
on
the
water
steps
she
turned
as
tony
approached
there
was
a
touch
of
defiance
in
her
manner
well
he
came
to
her
side
and
leaned
carelessly
against
the
parapet
his
eyes
on
the
as
she
tossed
and
dipped
in
the
wash
of
the
which
was
just
puffing
out
from
the
village
landing
constance
watched
him
slightly
taken
aback
she
had
expected
him
to
be
angry
sulky
reproachful
certainly
not
nonchalant
when
he
finally
brought
his
eyes
from
the
water
his
expression
was
mildly
melancholy
signorina
i
have
come
to
say
good
bye
it
is
very
sad
but
tomorrow
i
too
he
waved
his
hand
toward
the
steamer
shall
be
a
passenger
you
are
going
away
from
valedolmo
he
nodded
unfortunately
yes
i
should
like
to
stay
but
he
shrugged
life
is
all
play
miss
wilder
though
one
would
like
to
be
a
forever
one
only
may
be
for
a
summer
holiday
i
am
your
debtor
for
a
unique
and
pleasant
experience
she
studied
his
face
without
speaking
did
it
mean
that
he
had
got
the
letter
and
was
hurt
or
did
it
perhaps
mean
that
he
had
got
the
letter
and
did
not
care
to
appear
as
jerry
junior
that
he
enjoyed
the
play
so
long
as
he
could
remain
incognito
and
stop
it
where
he
pleased
but
that
he
had
no
mind
to
let
it
drift
into
reality
very
possibly
it
meant
she
flushed
at
the
thought
that
he
divined
nannie
plot
and
refused
also
to
consider
the
fourth
candidate
she
laughed
and
dropped
into
their
usual
jargon
and
the
young
american
man
signor
abraham
lincoln
will
he
come
tomorrow
for
tea
ah
signorina
he
is
desolated
but
it
is
not
possible
he
has
received
a
letter
and
he
must
go
he
has
stopped
too
long
in
valedolmo
tomorrow
morning
early
he
and
i
togever
we
sail
away
to
austria
his
eyes
went
back
to
the
trail
of
smoke
left
by
the
little
steamer
and
costantina
tony
you
are
leaving
her
behind
it
took
some
courage
to
put
this
question
but
she
did
not
flinch
she
put
it
with
a
laugh
which
contained
nothing
but
raillery
tony
sighed
a
deep
melodramatic
sigh
and
laid
his
hand
on
his
heart
ah
signorina
zat
costantina
she
has
not
any
heart
she
love
one
man
one
day
anozzer
ze
next
i
go
away
to
forget
his
eyes
dropped
to
hers
for
an
instant
the
mocking
light
died
out
a
questioning
wounded
look
took
its
place
she
felt
a
quick
impulse
to
hold
out
her
hands
to
say
jerry
go
if
she
only
knew
was
he
going
because
he
thought
that
she
wished
to
dismiss
him
or
because
he
wished
to
dismiss
himself
was
it
pique
that
bade
him
carry
the
play
to
the
end
or
was
it
merely
the
desire
to
get
out
of
an
awkward
situation
gracefully
she
stood
hesitating
scanning
the
terrace
pavement
with
troubled
eyes
when
she
raised
them
to
his
face
the
chance
was
gone
he
straightened
his
shoulders
with
an
air
of
finality
and
picked
up
his
hat
from
the
balustrade
some
day
signorina
in
new
york
perhaps
i
play
a
little
tune
underneaf
your
window
she
nodded
and
smiled
i
will
give
the
monkey
a
penny
when
he
comes
he
bowed
over
her
hand
and
touched
it
lightly
to
his
lips
signorina
as
he
strode
away
into
the
dusky
lane
of
cypresses
she
heard
him
whistling
softly
santa
lucia
it
was
the
last
stroke
she
reflected
angrily
he
might
at
least
have
omitted
that
she
turned
away
and
dropped
down
on
the
water
steps
to
wait
for
the
the
terrace
the
lake
the
beautiful
italian
night
suddenly
seemed
deserted
and
empty
before
she
knew
it
was
coming
she
had
leaned
her
head
against
the
balustrade
with
a
deep
sob
she
caught
herself
sharply
she
to
sit
there
crying
while
tony
went
whistling
on
his
way
as
the
drifted
idly
over
the
water
constance
sat
in
the
stern
her
chin
in
her
hand
moodily
gazing
at
the
shimmering
path
of
moonlight
but
no
one
appeared
to
notice
her
silence
since
nannie
was
talking
enough
for
both
and
the
only
thing
she
talked
about
was
jerry
junior
how
funny
and
clever
and
charming
he
was
how
phenomenally
good
for
a
man
when
she
showed
signs
of
stopping
wilder
by
a
question
started
her
on
it
seemed
to
constance
an
interminable
two
hours
before
they
dropped
their
guests
in
the
garden
of
the
hotel
du
lac
and
headed
again
for
villa
rosa
as
they
approached
their
own
water
steps
it
became
apparent
that
someone
a
man
was
standing
at
the
top
in
an
attitude
of
expectancy
constance
heart
gave
a
sudden
bound
and
the
next
instant
sank
deep
a
babble
of
frenzied
greetings
floated
out
to
meet
them
there
was
no
mistaking
gustavo
moreover
there
was
no
mistaking
the
fact
that
he
was
excited
his
excitement
was
contagious
even
before
they
had
learned
the
reason
he
stuttered
in
his
impatience
to
share
the
news
signore
a
calamity
has
happened
zat
tony
zat
he
has
got
hisself
arrested
zay
say
it
is
a
lie
zat
he
is
american
citizen
he
is
an
officer
who
is
dessert
from
ze
italian
army
zay
say
he
just
pretend
he
can
not
spik
italian
but
it
is
not
true
he
know
ten
leven
words
they
came
hurrying
up
the
steps
and
surrounded
him
wilder
no
less
shocked
than
gustavo
himself
arrested
as
a
deserter
it
an
outrage
he
thundered
constance
laid
her
hand
on
gustavo
sleeve
and
whirled
him
about
what
do
you
mean
i
do
understand
where
is
tony
gustavo
groaned
in
jail
signorina
four
carabinieri
are
come
to
take
him
away
and
he
fight
he
fight
like
ze
devil
but
zay
put
he
indicated
handcuffs
and
he
go
constance
dropped
down
on
the
upper
step
and
leaning
her
head
against
the
balustrade
she
laughed
until
she
was
weak
her
father
whirled
upon
her
indignantly
constance
have
you
any
sympathy
for
the
man
this
is
a
laughing
matter
i
know
dad
but
it
so
funny
tony
an
italian
officer
he
pronounce
the
ten
leven
words
he
does
know
right
of
course
he
ca
he
does
know
as
much
italian
as
i
do
these
fools
tell
an
american
citizen
when
they
see
one
i
teach
to
go
about
chucking
american
citizens
in
jail
i
telegraph
the
consul
in
milan
i
make
an
international
matter
of
it
he
fumed
up
and
down
the
terrace
while
constance
rose
to
her
feet
and
followed
after
with
a
pretense
at
pacification
hush
dad
do
be
so
excitable
it
was
a
very
natural
mistake
for
them
to
make
but
if
tony
is
really
what
he
says
he
is
it
will
be
very
easily
proved
you
must
be
sure
of
your
ground
though
before
you
act
i
like
to
say
anything
against
poor
tony
now
that
he
is
in
trouble
but
i
have
always
felt
that
there
was
a
mystery
connected
with
him
for
all
we
know
he
may
be
a
murderer
or
a
brigand
or
an
escaped
convict
in
disguise
we
only
have
his
word
you
know
that
he
is
an
american
citizen
his
word
wilder
fairly
exploded
are
you
utterly
blind
exactly
as
much
an
american
citizen
as
i
am
he
he
stopped
and
fanned
himself
furiously
he
had
sworn
never
to
betray
tony
secret
and
yet
the
present
situation
was
exceptionable
constance
patted
him
on
the
arm
there
dad
i
have
a
doubt
his
story
is
true
he
was
born
in
budapest
and
he
a
naturalized
american
citizen
it
the
duty
of
the
united
states
government
to
protect
him
but
it
wo
be
difficult
i
dare
say
he
got
his
naturalization
papers
with
him
a
word
in
the
morning
will
set
everything
straight
leave
him
in
jail
all
night
but
you
ca
do
anything
now
it
after
ten
the
authorities
have
gone
to
bed
she
turned
to
gustavo
her
tone
was
reassuring
in
the
morning
we
get
some
american
to
bombard
the
jail
signorina
you
joke
his
tone
was
reproachful
she
suddenly
looked
anxious
gustavo
is
the
jail
strong
ver
strong
signorina
he
ca
escape
and
get
over
into
austria
we
are
very
near
the
frontier
you
know
no
signorina
it
is
impossible
he
shook
his
head
hopelessly
constance
laughed
and
slipped
her
hand
through
her
father
arm
come
dad
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
we
go
down
to
the
jail
and
cheer
him
up
there
not
the
slightest
use
in
worrying
any
more
tonight
it
wo
hurt
tony
to
be
kept
in
er
cold
storage
for
a
few
hours
i
think
on
the
whole
it
will
do
him
good
she
nodded
dismissal
to
gustavo
and
drew
her
father
still
muttering
toward
the
house
chapter
xvii
jerry
junior
letter
of
regret
arrived
from
riva
on
the
early
mail
in
the
light
of
constance
effusively
cordial
invitation
the
terse
formality
of
his
reply
was
little
short
of
rude
but
constance
read
between
the
lines
and
was
appeased
the
writer
plainly
was
angry
and
anger
was
a
much
more
becoming
emotion
than
nonchalance
as
she
set
out
with
her
father
toward
the
village
jail
she
was
again
buoyantly
in
command
of
the
situation
she
carried
a
bunch
of
oleanders
and
the
pink
and
white
egg
basket
swung
from
her
arm
their
way
led
past
the
gate
of
the
hotel
du
lac
and
wilder
being
under
the
impression
that
he
was
enjoying
a
very
good
joke
all
by
himself
could
not
forego
the
temptation
of
stopping
to
inquire
if
eustace
and
nannie
had
heard
any
news
of
the
prodigal
they
found
the
two
at
breakfast
in
the
courtyard
an
open
letter
spread
before
them
nannie
received
them
with
lamentations
we
ca
come
to
the
villa
here
a
letter
from
jerry
wanting
us
to
start
immediately
for
the
dolomites
did
you
ever
know
anything
so
exasperating
she
passed
the
letter
to
constance
and
then
as
she
remembered
the
first
sentence
made
a
hasty
attempt
to
draw
it
back
it
was
too
late
constance
eyes
had
already
pounced
upon
it
she
read
it
aloud
with
gleeful
malice
in
thunder
is
constance
wilder
if
that
an
example
of
the
famous
jerry
junior
politeness
i
prefer
not
to
meet
him
thank
it
worse
than
his
last
insult
i
shall
forgive
this
she
glanced
down
the
page
and
handed
it
back
with
a
laugh
from
her
point
of
vantage
it
was
naïvely
transparent
from
wilder
point
however
the
contents
were
inscrutable
he
looked
from
the
letter
to
his
serene
smile
and
relapsed
into
a
puzzled
silence
i
should
say
on
the
contrary
that
he
want
you
to
start
immediately
for
the
dolomites
constance
observed
it
a
girl
nannie
groaned
i
suspected
it
from
the
moment
we
got
the
telegram
in
lucerne
oh
why
did
i
ever
let
that
wretched
boy
get
out
of
my
sight
i
dare
say
she
horrid
constance
put
in
one
meets
such
frightful
americans
traveling
we
will
go
up
to
riva
on
the
afternoon
boat
and
investigate
it
was
eustace
who
spoke
there
was
an
undertone
in
her
voice
which
suggested
that
she
was
prepared
to
do
her
duty
by
her
brother
son
however
unpleasant
that
duty
might
be
american
girls
are
so
grasping
said
nannie
plaintively
it
scarcely
safe
for
an
unattached
man
to
go
out
alone
wilder
leaned
forward
and
reexamined
the
letter
by
the
way
miss
nannie
how
did
jerry
learn
that
you
were
here
his
letter
i
see
was
mailed
in
riva
at
ten
last
night
nannie
examined
the
post
mark
i
had
thought
of
that
how
could
he
have
found
out
unless
that
beast
of
a
head
waiter
telegraphed
what
does
it
mean
wilder
spread
out
his
hands
and
raised
his
shoulders
you
got
me
a
gleam
of
illumination
suddenly
flashed
over
his
face
he
turned
to
his
daughter
with
what
was
meant
to
be
a
carelessly
manner
er
constance
while
i
think
of
it
you
did
discharge
tony
again
yesterday
did
you
constance
opened
her
eyes
discharge
tony
why
should
i
do
that
he
is
working
for
me
you
were
rude
to
him
father
am
i
ever
rude
to
anyone
wilder
looked
at
the
envelope
again
and
shook
his
head
something
mighty
fishy
about
this
whole
business
when
you
get
hold
of
that
brother
of
yours
again
my
dear
young
woman
you
make
him
tell
what
he
been
up
to
this
week
and
make
him
tell
the
truth
mr
wilder
nannie
was
reproachful
you
do
know
jerry
incapable
of
telling
anything
but
the
truth
constance
tittered
what
are
you
laughing
at
constance
nothing
only
it
so
funny
why
do
you
advertise
for
him
lost
a
young
man
age
height

hundred
and
seventy
pounds
dark

finder
please
return
to
hotel
du
lac
and
receive
liberal
reward
he
is
lost
said
nannie
we
know
where
he
is
perfectly
he
at
the
hotel
sole
d
oro
in
riva
and
that
at
the
other
end
of
the
lake
going
up
on
the
afternoon
boat
to
join
him
oh
said
constance
meekly
you
take
my
advice
wilder
put
in
go
up
to
riva
if
you
must
it
a
pleasant
trip
but
leave
your
luggage
here
see
this
young
man
in
person
and
bring
him
back
with
you
tell
him
we
have
just
as
good
mountains
as
he
find
in
the
dolomites
if
by
any
chance
you
find
him
of
course
we
find
him
said
nannie
constance
looked
troubled
do
go
it
quite
a
long
trip
write
instead
and
give
the
letter
to
gustavo
he
give
it
to
the
boat
steward
who
will
deliver
it
personally
then
if
jerry
should
be
there
nannie
was
losing
her
patience
should
be
there
but
he
he
there
oh
yes
certainly
that
ends
it
only
you
know
nannie
believe
there
really
is
any
such
person
as
jerry
junior
i
think
he
a
myth
gustavo
had
been
hanging
about
the
gate
looking
anxiously
up
the
road
as
if
he
expected
something
to
happen
his
brow
cleared
suddenly
as
a
boy
on
a
bicycle
appeared
in
the
distance
the
boy
whirled
into
the
court
and
dismounted
glancing
dubiously
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
group
he
finally
presented
his
telegram
to
gustavo
who
passed
it
on
to
nannie
she
ripped
it
open
and
ran
her
eyes
over
the
contents
can
anyone
tell
me
the
meaning
of
this
it
italian
she
spread
it
on
the
table
while
the
three
bent
over
it
in
puzzled
wonder
ceingide
mai
maind
dunat
comtu
riva
stei
in
valedolmo
geri
constance
was
the
first
to
grasp
the
meaning
she
read
it
twice
and
laughed
that
not
italian
it
english
only
the
operator
has
spelt
it
phonetically
i
begin
to
believe
there
is
a
jerry
she
added
no
one
could
cause
such
a
bother
who
did
exist
she
picked
up
the
slip
and
translated
my
mind
do
not
come
to
riva
stay
in
valedolmo
jerry
i
a
clairvoyant
you
see
i
told
you
he
would
be
there
but
where
is
he
nannie
wailed
constance
and
her
father
glanced
tentatively
at
each
other
and
were
silent
gustavo
who
had
been
hanging
officiously
in
the
rear
approached
and
begged
their
pardon
signora
but
i
sink
i
can
explain
ze
telegram
is
dated
from
limone
zat
is
a
village
close
by
here
on
ze
ozzer
side
of
ze
lake
he
is
gone
on
a
walking
trip
ze
yong
man
of
two
tree
days
wif
an
englishman
who
is
been
in
zis
hotel
if
he
expect
you
so
soon
he
would
not
go
but
patience
he
will
come
back
oh
yes
in
a
little
while
after
one
two
day
he
come
back
what
is
the
man
talking
about
eustace
was
both
indignant
and
bewildered
jerry
was
in
riva
yesterday
at
the
hotel
sole
d
oro
how
can
he
be
on
a
walking
trip
at
the
other
end
of
the
lake
today
you
do
suppose
nannie
voice
was
tragic
that
he
has
eloped
with
that
american
girl
good
heavens
my
dear
eustace
appealed
to
wilder
what
are
the
laws
in
this
dreadful
country
do
banns
or
something
have
to
be
published
three
weeks
before
the
ceremony
can
take
place
wilder
rose
hastily
yes
yes
dear
lady
it
impossible
do
consider
any
such
catastrophe
for
a
moment
come
constance
i
really
think
we
ought
to
be
er
you
see
eustace
you
ca
believe
that
is
do
let
anything
gustavo
says
trouble
you
with
all
respect
for
his
many
fine
qualities
he
has
not
jerry
regard
for
truth
and
do
bother
any
more
about
the
boy
he
will
turn
up
in
a
day
or
so
he
may
have
written
some
letters
of
explanation
that
you
have
got
these
foreign
mails
he
edged
toward
the
gate
constance
followed
him
and
then
turned
back
we
on
our
way
to
the
jail
she
said
to
visit
our
who
has
managed
to
get
himself
arrested
while
we
there
we
can
make
inquiries
if
you
like
it
barely
possible
that
they
might
have
got
hold
of
jerry
on
some
false
charge
or
other
these
foreign
jails
constance
said
nannie
reproachfully
oh
my
dear
i
was
only
joking
of
course
it
impossible
good
bye
she
nodded
and
laughed
and
ran
after
her
father
chapter
xviii
if
one
must
go
to
jail
at
all
one
could
scarcely
choose
a
more
entertaining
jail
than
that
of
valedolmo
it
occupies
a
structure
which
was
once
a
palace
and
its
cells
planned
for
other
purposes
are
spacious
but
its
most
gratifying
feature
to
one
forcibly
removed
from
social
intercourse
is
its
outlook
the
windows
command
the
piazza
garibaldi
which
is
the
social
center
of
the
town
it
contains
the
village
post
the
fountain
the
tobacco
shop
the
and
the
two
rival
cafès
the
independenza
and
the
libertà
the
piazza
is
always
dirty
and
noisy
that
goes
without
saying
but
on
wednesday
morning
at
nine
it
is
peculiarly
dirty
and
noisy
wednesday
is
valedolmo
market
day
and
the
square
is
so
cluttered
with
booths
and
huxters
and
anxious
buyers
that
the
peaceable
pedestrian
can
scarcely
wedge
his
way
through
the
noise
moreover
is
deafening
above
the
cries
of
vendors
and
buyers
rises
a
shriller
chorus
of
bleating
kids
and
squealing
pigs
and
braying
donkeys
wilder
red
in
the
face
and
short
of
temper
pushed
through
the
crowd
with
little
ceremony
prodding
on
the
right
with
his
umbrella
on
the
left
with
his
fan
and
using
his
elbows
vigorously
constance
serenely
cool
followed
in
his
wake
nodding
here
and
there
to
a
chance
acquaintance
smiling
on
everyone
the
spectacle
to
her
held
always
fresh
interest
an
image
vendor
close
at
her
elbow
insisted
that
she
should
buy
a
madonna
and
bambina
for
fifty
centesimi
or
at
least
a
san
giuseppe
for
to
her
father
disgust
she
bought
them
both
and
presented
them
to
two
children
who
in
bashful
fascination
were
dogging
their
footsteps
the
appearance
of
the
foreigners
in
the
piazza
caused
such
a
ripple
of
interest
that
for
a
moment
the
bargaining
was
suspended
when
the
two
mounted
the
steps
of
the
jail
and
jerked
the
bell
as
many
of
the
bystanders
as
the
steps
would
accommodate
mounted
with
them
nobody
answered
the
first
ring
and
constance
pulled
again
with
a
force
which
sent
a
jangle
of
bells
echoing
through
the
interior
after
a
wait
snortingly
impatient
on
wilder
part
he
was
being
pressed
close
by
the
none
too
clean
citizens
of
valedolmo
the
door
was
opened
a
very
small
crack
by
a
frowsy
jailoress
her
eye
fell
first
upon
the
crowd
and
she
was
disposed
to
close
it
again
but
in
the
act
she
caught
sight
of
the
signorina
americana
dressed
in
white
smiling
above
a
bouquet
of
oleanders
her
eyes
widened
with
astonishment
it
was
long
since
such
an
apparition
had
presented
itself
at
that
door
she
dropped
a
courtesy
and
the
crack
widened
your
commands
signorina
we
wish
to
come
in
illustration
the
two
mounted
the
steps
of
the
jail
and
jerked
the
bell
but
it
is
against
the
orders
friday
is
at
thirteen
if
the
signorina
had
a
from
the
why
then
the
signorina
shook
her
head
and
shrugged
her
shoulders
she
had
no
and
it
was
too
much
trouble
to
get
one
besides
the
office
did
open
till
ten
she
glanced
down
there
was
a
shining
piece
in
her
hand
perhaps
the
jailoress
would
allow
them
to
step
inside
away
from
the
crowd
and
she
would
explain
this
sounded
reasonable
the
door
opened
farther
and
they
squeezed
through
it
banged
in
the
faces
of
the
disappointed
spectators
who
lingered
hopefully
a
few
moments
longer
and
then
returned
to
their
bargaining
inside
the
big
damp
corridor
constance
drew
a
deep
breath
and
smiled
upon
the
jailoress
the
jailoress
smiled
back
then
as
a
preliminary
skirmish
constance
presented
the
piece
and
the
jailoress
dropped
a
courtesy
we
have
heard
that
antonio
our
has
been
arrested
for
deserting
from
the
army
and
we
have
come
to
find
out
about
it
my
father
the
signore
here
she
waved
her
hand
toward
wilder
likes
antonio
very
much
and
is
quite
sure
that
it
is
a
mistake
the
woman
mouth
hardened
she
nodded
with
emphasis
we
have
him
the
man
antonio
if
that
is
his
name
he
may
not
be
the
deserter
they
search
i
do
not
know
but
if
he
is
not
the
deserter
he
is
something
else
you
should
have
heard
him
last
night
signorina
when
they
brought
him
in
the
things
he
said
they
were
in
a
foreign
tongue
i
did
not
understand
but
i
also
he
kicked
my
husband
kicked
him
quite
hard
so
that
he
limps
today
and
the
way
he
orders
us
about
you
would
think
he
were
a
prince
in
his
own
palace
and
we
were
his
servants
nothing
is
good
enough
for
him
he
objected
to
the
room
we
gave
him
first
because
it
smelt
of
the
cooking
he
likes
butter
with
his
bread
and
hot
milk
with
his
coffee
he
can
not
smoke
the
cigars
which
my
husband
bought
for
him
and
they
cost
three
soldi
apiece
and
this
morning
her
voice
rose
shrilly
as
she
approached
the
climax
he
called
for
a
bath
it
is
true
signorina
a
he
wished
me
to
carry
the
entire
village
fountain
to
his
room
not
really
constance
opened
her
eyes
in
shocked
surprise
but
surely
signora
you
did
not
do
it
the
woman
blinked
it
would
be
impossible
signorina
she
contented
herself
with
saying
constance
with
grave
concern
translated
the
sum
of
tony
enormities
to
her
father
and
turned
back
to
the
jailoress
apologetically
my
father
is
very
much
grieved
that
the
man
should
have
caused
you
so
much
trouble
but
he
says
that
if
we
could
see
him
we
could
persuade
him
to
be
more
reasonable
we
talk
his
language
and
can
make
him
understand
the
woman
winked
meaningly
eh
he
pretends
he
can
not
talk
italian
but
he
understands
enough
to
ask
for
what
he
wishes
i
think
and
the
who
ordered
his
arrest
thinks
that
he
is
shamming
it
was
a
lieutenant
who
ordered
his
arrest
do
you
remember
his
name
was
it
carlo
di
ferara
it
might
have
been
her
face
was
vague
of
the
cavalry
signorina
of
the
cavalry
and
very
handsome
constance
laughed
well
the
plot
thickens
dad
you
must
come
to
hearing
this
afternoon
and
put
it
tactfully
to
our
friend
the
lieutenant
that
we
do
like
to
have
our
snatched
away
without
our
permission
she
turned
back
to
the
jailoress
and
now
where
is
the
man
we
should
like
to
speak
with
him
it
is
against
the
orders
but
perhaps
i
have
already
permitted
the
head
waiter
from
the
hotel
du
lac
to
carry
him
newspapers
and
cigarettes
he
says
that
the
man
antonio
is
in
reality
an
american
nobleman
from
new
york
who
merely
plays
at
being
a
for
diversion
and
that
unless
he
is
set
at
liberty
immediately
a
ship
will
come
with
cannon
but
we
all
know
gustavo
signorina
constance
nodded
and
laughed
you
have
reason
we
all
know
gustavo
may
we
go
right
up
the
jailoress
called
the
jailor
they
talked
aside
the
piece
was
produced
as
evidence
the
jailor
with
a
great
show
of
caution
got
out
a
bunch
of
keys
and
motioned
them
to
follow
up
two
flights
and
down
a
long
corridor
with
peeling
frescoes
on
the
walls
nymphs
and
cupids
and
garlands
of
roses
most
incongruous
decorations
for
a
jail
at
last
they
paused
before
a
heavy
oak
door
their
guide
tried
two
wrong
keys
swore
softly
as
each
failed
to
turn
and
finally
with
an
exclamation
of
triumph
produced
the
right
one
he
swung
the
door
wide
and
stepped
back
with
a
bow
a
large
room
was
revealed
and
somewhat
scanty
as
to
furniture
but
with
a
view
an
admirable
view
if
one
did
not
mind
its
being
checked
off
into
iron
squares
the
most
conspicuous
object
in
the
room
however
was
its
occupant
as
he
sat
in
an
essentially
american
attitude
with
his
chair
tipped
back
and
his
feet
on
the
table
a
cloud
of
tobacco
smoke
and
a
wide
spread
copy
of
a
new
york
paper
concealed
him
from
too
impertinent
gaze
he
did
not
raise
his
head
at
the
sound
of
the
opening
door
but
contented
himself
with
growling
confound
your
impudence
you
might
at
least
knock
before
you
come
in
constance
laughed
and
advanced
a
hesitating
step
across
the
threshold
tony
dropped
his
paper
and
sprang
to
his
feet
his
face
assuming
a
shade
of
pink
only
less
vivid
than
the
oleanders
she
shook
her
head
sorrowfully
i
do
need
to
tell
you
tony
how
shocked
we
are
to
find
you
in
such
a
place
our
trust
has
been
rudely
shaken
we
had
not
supposed
we
were
harboring
a
deserter
wilder
stepped
forward
and
held
out
his
hand
there
was
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
which
he
struggled
manfully
to
suppress
nonsense
tony
we
do
believe
a
word
of
it
you
a
deserter
from
the
italian
army
it
preposterous
where
are
your
naturalization
papers
thank
you
wilder
but
i
do
happen
to
have
my
papers
with
me
i
trust
it
wo
be
necessary
to
produce
them
you
see
his
glance
rested
entirely
on
wilder
he
studiously
overlooked
presence
this
angelo
fresi
the
fellow
they
are
after
got
into
a
quarrel
over
a
gambling
debt
and
struck
a
superior
officer
to
avoid
being
he
lit
out
it
happened
a
month
ago
in
milan
and
they
been
looking
for
him
ever
since
now
last
night
i
had
the
misfortune
to
tip
lieutenant
carlo
di
ferara
over
into
a
ditch
the
matter
was
entirely
accidental
and
i
regretted
it
very
much
i
of
course
apologized
but
what
did
the
lieutenant
do
but
take
it
into
his
head
that
i
being
an
assaulter
of
superior
officers
was
by
reasoning
this
angelo
fresi
in
disguise
accordingly
he
waved
his
hand
around
the
room
you
see
me
here
it
an
imposition
depriving
an
american
citizen
of
his
liberty
on
any
such
charge
as
that
i
telegraph
the
consul
in
milan
i
oh
do
trouble
i
get
off
this
afternoon
they
sent
for
someone
to
identify
me
and
if
he
does
succeed
i
do
see
how
they
can
hold
me
in
the
meantime
i
comfortable
enough
wilder
eye
wandered
about
the
room
h
it
is
bad
for
a
jail
got
everything
you
need
tobacco
papers
what
this
new
york
only
ten
days
old
he
picked
it
up
and
plunged
into
the
headlines
constance
turned
from
the
window
and
glanced
casually
at
tony
you
did
go
to
austria
after
all
i
was
detained
i
hope
to
get
off
tomorrow
oh
before
i
forget
it
she
removed
the
basket
from
her
arm
and
set
it
on
the
table
here
is
some
lemon
jelly
tony
i
could
remember
whether
one
takes
lemon
jelly
to
prisoners
or
invalids
i
never
known
any
prisoners
before
you
see
but
anyway
i
hope
you
like
it
elizabetta
made
it
he
bowed
stiffly
i
beg
of
you
to
convey
my
thanks
to
elizabetta
tony
she
lowered
her
voice
to
a
conspiratorial
whisper
and
glanced
apprehensively
over
her
shoulder
to
see
if
the
jailor
were
listening
if
by
any
chance
they
identify
you
as
that
deserter
just
get
word
to
me
and
i
will
have
elizabetta
bake
you
a
veal
pasty
with
a
rope
ladder
and
a
file
inside
i
would
have
had
her
bake
it
this
morning
only
wednesday
is
at
the
villa
and
she
was
so
awfully
busy
this
is
your
innings
tony
rejoined
somewhat
sulkily
i
hope
get
all
the
entertainment
you
can
out
of
the
situation
thank
you
tony
that
kind
of
course
she
added
with
a
plaintive
note
in
her
voice
this
must
be
tiresome
for
you
but
it
is
a
pleasant
surprise
for
me
i
was
feeling
very
sad
last
night
tony
at
the
thought
that
you
were
going
to
austria
and
that
i
should
never
never
see
you
any
more
i
wish
i
knew
whether
there
any
truth
in
that
statement
or
not
any
truth
i
realize
well
that
i
might
search
the
whole
world
over
and
never
find
another
who
sings
such
beautiful
tenor
who
wears
such
lovely
sashes
and
such
becoming
earrings
why
tony
she
took
a
step
nearer
and
her
face
assumed
a
look
of
consternation
you
lost
your
earrings
he
turned
his
back
and
walked
to
the
window
where
he
stood
moodily
staring
at
the
market
constance
watched
his
squared
shoulders
dubiously
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
then
she
glanced
momentarily
into
the
hall
where
the
jailor
was
visible
his
face
flattened
against
the
bars
of
an
open
window
and
from
him
to
her
father
still
deep
in
the
columns
of
his
paper
oblivious
to
both
time
and
place
she
crossed
to
tony
and
stood
at
his
side
peering
down
at
the
scene
below
i
do
suppose
it
will
interest
you
she
said
in
an
tone
her
eyes
still
intent
on
the
crowd
but
i
got
a
letter
this
morning
from
a
young
man
who
is
stopping
at
the
sole
d
oro
in
riva
a
very
rude
letter
i
thought
he
whirled
about
you
know
it
struck
me
that
the
person
who
wrote
it
was
in
a
temper
and
might
afterwards
be
sorry
for
having
hurt
my
feelings
and
so
she
raised
her
eyes
momentarily
to
his
the
invitation
is
still
open
tell
me
there
was
both
entreaty
and
command
in
his
tone
did
you
know
the
truth
before
you
wrote
that
letter
you
mean
did
i
know
whom
i
was
inviting
assuredly
do
you
think
it
would
have
been
dignified
to
write
such
an
informal
invitation
to
a
person
i
did
not
know
she
turned
away
quickly
and
laid
her
hand
on
her
father
shoulder
come
dad
do
you
think
we
ought
to
be
going
poor
tony
wants
to
read
the
paper
himself
wilder
came
back
to
the
jail
and
his
companions
with
a
start
oh
eh
yes
i
think
perhaps
we
ought
if
they
do
let
you
out
this
afternoon
tony
i
make
matters
lively
for
and
if
anything
you
need
send
word
by
gustavo
i
be
back
later
he
fished
in
his
pockets
and
brought
up
a
handful
of
cigars
here
something
better
than
lemon
jelly
and
they
not
from
the
tobacco
shop
in
valedolmo
either
he
dropped
them
on
the
table
and
turned
toward
the
door
constance
followed
with
a
backward
glance
tony
do
despair
remember
that
it
always
darkest
before
the
dawn
and
that
whatever
others
think
costantina
and
i
believe
in
you
know
that
you
are
incapable
of
telling
anything
but
the
truth
she
had
almost
reached
the
door
when
she
became
aware
of
the
flowers
in
her
hand
she
hurried
back
oh
i
forgot
costantina
sent
these
with
her
with
she
faltered
her
audacity
did
not
go
quite
that
far
tony
reached
for
them
with
what
he
insisted
she
laughed
and
a
second
later
the
door
closed
behind
her
he
stood
staring
at
the
door
till
he
heard
the
key
turn
in
the
lock
then
he
looked
down
at
the
flowers
in
his
hand
a
note
was
tied
to
the
stems
his
fingers
trembled
as
he
worked
with
the
knot
antonio
it
commenced
he
could
read
that
sua
it
ended
he
could
read
that
but
between
the
two
was
an
elusive
tantalizing
hiatus
he
studied
it
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
and
took
it
out
and
studied
it
again
he
was
still
puzzling
over
it
half
an
hour
later
when
gustavo
came
to
inquire
if
the
signore
had
need
of
anything
had
he
need
of
anything
he
sent
gustavo
flying
to
the
stationer
in
search
of
an
dictionary
it
was
four
in
the
afternoon
and
all
the
world
except
constance
was
taking
a
siesta
the
anchored
at
the
foot
of
the
water
steps
in
a
blaze
of
sunshine
was
dipping
up
and
down
in
drowsy
harmony
with
the
lapping
waves
she
was
for
the
moment
abandoned
giuseppe
being
engaged
with
a
nap
in
the
shade
of
the
cypress
trees
at
the
end
of
the
drive
he
was
so
very
engaged
that
he
did
not
hear
the
sound
of
an
approaching
carriage
until
the
horse
was
pulled
to
a
sudden
halt
to
avoid
stepping
on
him
giuseppe
staggered
sleepily
to
his
feet
and
rubbed
his
eyes
he
saw
a
gentleman
descend
a
gentleman
clothed
as
for
a
wedding
in
a
frock
coat
and
a
white
waistcoat
in
shining
hat
and
pearl
gray
gloves
and
a
boutonnière
of
oleander
having
paid
the
driver
and
dismissed
the
carriage
the
gentleman
fumbled
in
his
pocket
for
his
giuseppe
hurrying
forward
with
a
polite
bow
stopped
suddenly
and
blinked
he
fancied
that
he
must
still
be
dreaming
he
rubbed
his
eyes
and
stared
again
but
he
found
the
second
inspection
more
confounding
than
the
first
the
gentleman
looked
back
imperturbably
no
slightest
shade
of
recognition
in
his
glance
unless
a
gleam
of
amusement
far
far
down
in
the
depths
of
his
eye
might
be
termed
recognition
he
extracted
a
card
with
grave
deliberation
and
handed
it
to
his
companion
vedere
la
signorina
he
remarked
the
tone
the
foreign
accent
were
both
reminiscent
of
many
a
friendly
though
halting
conversation
giuseppe
stared
again
appealingly
but
the
gentleman
did
not
help
him
out
on
the
contrary
he
repeated
his
request
in
a
slightly
sharpened
tone
giuseppe
stammered
di
verire
la
signorina
è
nel
he
started
ahead
toward
the
garden
looking
behind
at
every
third
step
to
make
sure
that
the
gentleman
was
still
following
that
he
was
not
merely
a
figment
of
his
own
sleepy
senses
their
direction
was
straight
toward
the
parapet
where
on
a
historic
the
signorina
had
sat
beside
a
row
of
dangling
stockings
she
was
sitting
there
now
dressed
in
white
the
oleander
tree
above
her
head
enveloping
her
in
a
glowing
and
fragrant
shade
so
occupied
was
she
with
a
dreamy
contemplation
of
the
mountains
across
the
lake
that
she
did
not
hear
footsteps
until
giuseppe
paused
before
her
and
presented
the
card
she
glanced
from
this
to
the
visitor
and
extended
a
friendly
hand
hilliard
good
afternoon
there
was
nothing
of
surprise
in
her
greeting
evidently
she
did
not
find
the
visit
extraordinary
giuseppe
stared
his
mouth
and
eyes
at
their
widest
until
the
signorina
dismissed
him
then
he
turned
and
walked
back
staggered
back
almost
never
before
not
even
late
at
night
on
corpus
domini
day
had
he
had
such
overwhelming
reason
to
doubt
his
senses
constance
turned
to
the
visitor
and
swept
him
with
an
appreciative
glance
her
eye
lingering
a
second
on
the
oleander
in
his
buttonhole
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
is
tony
out
of
jail
i
am
so
anxious
to
know
he
shook
his
head
found
guilty
and
sentenced
for
life
you
never
see
him
again
ah
poor
tony
i
shall
miss
him
i
shall
miss
him
too
we
had
very
good
times
together
constance
suddenly
became
aware
that
her
guest
was
still
standing
she
moved
along
and
made
place
on
the
wall
wo
you
sit
down
oh
excuse
me
she
added
with
an
anxious
glance
at
his
clothes
i
afraid
get
dusty
it
would
be
better
to
bring
a
chair
she
nodded
toward
the
terrace
he
sat
down
beside
her
i
am
only
too
honored
the
last
time
i
came
you
did
not
invite
me
to
sit
on
the
wall
i
am
sorry
if
i
appeared
inhospitable
but
you
came
so
unexpectedly
mr
hilliard
why
hilliard
when
you
wrote
you
called
me
jerry
that
was
a
slip
of
the
pen
i
hope
you
will
excuse
it
when
i
wrote
i
called
you
wilder
that
was
a
slip
of
the
pen
too
what
i
meant
to
say
was
constance
she
let
this
pass
without
comment
i
have
an
apology
to
make
yes
once
a
long
time
ago
i
insulted
you
i
called
you
a
kid
i
take
it
back
i
swallow
the
word
you
were
never
a
kid
oh
she
dimpled
and
then
i
do
believe
you
remember
a
thing
about
it
illustration
never
before
had
he
had
such
overwhelming
reason
to
doubt
his
senses
connie
wilder
a
little
girl
in
a
blue
sailor
suit
and
two
nice
fat
braids
of
yellow
hair
dangling
down
her
back
with
red
bows
on
the
ends
very
convenient
for
pulling
you
are
making
that
up
you
do
remember
ah
but
i
do
and
as
for
the
racket
you
were
making
that
afternoon
it
was
if
you
will
permit
the
expression
i
remember
it
distinctly
i
was
trying
to
cram
for
a
math
exam
it
was
i
it
was
your
bad
little
sisters
and
brothers
and
cousins
it
was
you
dear
constance
i
saw
you
with
my
own
eyes
i
heard
you
with
my
own
ears
bobbie
hilliard
was
pulling
my
hair
i
apologize
on
his
behalf
and
with
that
we
will
close
the
incident
there
is
something
much
more
important
which
i
wish
to
talk
about
have
you
seen
nannie
she
offered
this
hastily
not
to
allow
a
pause
yes
dear
constance
i
have
seen
nannie
call
me
wilder
please
i
be
hanged
if
i
will
you
been
calling
me
tony
and
jerry
and
anything
else
you
chose
ever
since
you
knew
me
and
long
before
for
the
matter
of
that
constance
waived
the
point
was
she
glad
to
see
you
she
always
glad
to
see
me
oh
do
be
so
provoking
give
me
the
particulars
was
she
surprised
how
did
you
explain
the
telegrams
and
letters
and
gustavo
stories
i
should
think
the
hotel
sole
at
riva
and
the
walking
trip
with
the
englishman
must
have
been
difficult
not
in
the
least
i
told
the
truth
the
truth
not
all
of
it
every
word
how
could
you
there
was
reproach
in
her
accent
it
did
come
hard
i
a
little
out
of
practice
did
you
tell
her
about
about
me
i
had
to
constance
when
it
came
to
the
necessity
of
squaring
all
of
gustavo
yarns
my
imagination
gave
out
anyway
i
had
to
tell
her
out
of
she
was
so
superior
she
said
it
was
just
like
a
man
to
muddle
everything
up
here
i
been
ten
days
in
the
same
town
with
the
most
charming
girl
in
the
world
and
had
so
much
as
discovered
her
name
whereas
if
had
been
managing
it
you
see
how
it
was
i
had
to
let
her
know
that
i
was
quite
capable
of
taking
care
of
myself
without
any
interference
from
her
i
even
anticipated
a
trifle
how
she
said
she
was
engaged
i
told
her
i
was
too
indeed
constance
tone
was
remote
to
whom
the
most
charming
girl
in
the
world
may
i
ask
her
name
he
laid
his
hand
on
his
heart
in
a
gesture
reminiscent
of
tony
costantina
oh
i
congratulate
you
thank
you
i
hoped
you
would
she
looked
away
gravely
toward
the
maggiore
rising
from
the
midst
of
its
clouds
his
gaze
followed
hers
and
for
three
minutes
there
was
silence
then
he
leaned
toward
her
constance
will
you
marry
me
no
a
pause
of
four
minutes
during
which
constance
stared
steadily
at
the
mountain
at
the
end
of
that
time
her
curiosity
overcame
her
dignity
she
glanced
at
him
sidewise
he
was
watching
her
with
a
smile
partly
of
amusement
partly
of
something
else
dear
constance
have
you
had
enough
of
play
are
you
never
going
to
grow
up
you
are
such
a
kid
she
turned
back
to
the
mountain
i
have
known
you
long
enough
she
threw
over
her
shoulder
six
years
one
week
and
two
days
through
three
incarnations
she
laughed
a
delicious
rippling
laugh
of
surrender
and
slipped
her
hand
into
his
you
do
deserve
it
jerry
after
the
fib
you
told
your
sister
but
i
think
on
the
whole
i
will
neither
noticed
that
wilder
had
stepped
out
from
the
house
and
was
strolling
down
the
cypress
alley
in
their
direction
he
rounded
the
corner
in
front
of
the
parapet
and
as
his
eye
fell
upon
them
came
to
a
startled
halt
the
young
man
failed
to
let
go
of
her
hand
and
constance
glanced
at
her
father
with
an
apprehensive
blush
here
tony
dad
he
out
of
jail
i
see
he
is
she
slipped
down
from
the
wall
and
brought
jerry
with
her
we
like
your
parental
blessing
please
i
going
to
marry
him
but
do
look
so
worried
he
is
really
a
nor
a
magyar
nor
an
orphan
nor
an
nor
any
of
the
things
he
has
said
he
was
he
is
just
a
plain
american
man
and
an
the
young
man
held
out
his
hand
and
wilder
shook
it
jerry
he
said
i
do
need
to
tell
you
how
pleased
echoed
constance
father
you
knew
long
before
you
did
my
dear
there
was
a
suggestion
of
triumph
in
wilder
tone
jerry
you
told
there
was
reproach
scorn
indignation
in
hers
jerry
spread
out
his
hands
in
a
gesture
of
repudiation
what
could
i
do
he
asked
my
name
the
day
we
climbed
monte
maggiore
naturally
i
could
tell
him
a
lie
then
we
have
fooled
anybody
how
unromantic
oh
yes
said
jerry
we
fooled
lots
of
people
gustavo
understand
and
giuseppe
you
noticed
looked
rather
dazed
then
lieutenant
carlo
di
ferara
oh
said
constance
her
face
suddenly
blank
you
can
explain
to
him
now
said
her
father
peering
through
the
trees
a
commotion
had
suddenly
arisen
on
the
terrace
the
rumble
of
wheels
the
confused
mingling
of
voices
constance
and
jerry
looked
too
they
found
the
yellow
omnibus
of
the
hotel
du
lac
its
roof
laden
with
luggage
drawn
up
at
the
end
of
the
driveway
and
eustace
and
nannie
on
the
point
of
descending
the
center
of
the
terrace
was
already
occupied
by
lieutenant
di
ferara
who
with
heels
clicked
together
and
white
gloved
hands
at
salute
was
in
the
act
of
achieving
a
military
bow
miss
hazel
fluttering
from
the
door
in
one
breath
welcomed
the
guests
presented
the
lieutenant
and
ordered
giuseppe
to
convey
the
luggage
upstairs
then
she
glanced
questioningly
about
the
terrace
i
thought
constance
and
her
father
were
here
giuseppe
giuseppe
dropped
his
end
of
a
trunk
and
approached
miss
hazel
handed
him
the
lieutenant
card
the
signorina
and
the
signore
in
the
garden
i
think
giuseppe
advanced
upon
the
garden
jerry
face
at
the
sight
became
as
blank
as
constance
the
two
cast
upon
each
other
a
glance
of
guilty
terror
and
from
this
looked
wildly
behind
for
a
means
of
escape
their
eyes
simultaneously
lighted
on
the
break
in
the
garden
wall
jerry
sprang
up
and
pulled
constance
after
him
on
the
top
she
gathered
her
skirts
together
preparatory
to
jumping
then
turned
back
for
a
moment
toward
her
father
dad
she
called
in
a
stage
whisper
you
go
and
meet
him
like
a
gentleman
tell
him
you
are
very
sorry
but
your
daughter
is
not
at
home
today
the
two
conspirators
scrambled
down
on
the
other
side
and
wilder
with
a
sigh
dutifully
stepped
forward
to
greet
the
guests
