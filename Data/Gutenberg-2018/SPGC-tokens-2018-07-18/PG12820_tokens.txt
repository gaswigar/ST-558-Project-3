the
case
for
india
the
presidential
address
delivered
by
annie
besant
at
the
indian
national
congress
held
at
calcutta
december
and
friends
everyone
who
has
preceded
me
in
this
chair
has
rendered
his
thanks
in
fitting
terms
for
the
gift
which
is
truly
said
to
be
the
highest
that
india
has
it
in
her
power
to
bestow
it
is
the
sign
of
her
fullest
love
trust
and
approval
and
the
one
whom
she
seats
in
that
chair
is
for
his
year
of
service
her
chosen
leader
but
if
my
predecessors
found
fitting
words
for
their
gratitude
in
what
words
can
i
voice
mine
whose
debt
to
you
is
so
overwhelmingly
greater
than
theirs
for
the
first
time
in
congress
history
you
have
chosen
as
your
president
one
who
when
your
choice
was
made
was
under
the
heavy
ban
of
government
displeasure
and
who
lay
interned
as
a
person
dangerous
to
public
safety
while
i
was
humiliated
you
crowned
me
with
honour
while
i
was
slandered
you
believed
in
my
integrity
and
good
faith
while
i
was
crushed
under
the
heel
of
bureaucratic
power
you
acclaimed
me
as
your
leader
while
i
was
silenced
and
unable
to
defend
myself
you
defended
me
and
won
for
me
release
i
was
proud
to
serve
in
lowliest
fashion
but
you
lifted
me
up
and
placed
me
before
the
world
as
your
chosen
representative
i
have
no
words
with
which
to
thank
you
no
eloquence
with
which
to
repay
my
debt
my
deeds
must
speak
for
me
for
words
are
too
poor
i
turn
your
gift
into
service
to
the
motherland
i
consecrate
my
life
anew
to
her
in
worship
by
action
all
that
i
have
and
am
i
lay
on
the
altar
of
the
mother
and
together
we
shall
cry
more
by
service
than
by
words
vande
mataram
there
is
perhaps
one
value
in
your
election
of
me
in
this
crisis
of
india
destiny
seeing
that
i
have
not
the
privilege
to
be
but
come
from
that
little
island
in
the
northern
seas
which
has
been
in
the
west
the
of
free
institutions
the
aryan
emigrants
who
spread
over
the
lands
of
europe
carried
with
them
the
seeds
of
liberty
sown
in
their
blood
in
their
asian
western
historians
trace
the
of
the
saxon
villages
to
their
earlier
prototypes
in
the
east
and
see
the
growth
of
english
liberty
as
from
the
aryan
root
of
the
free
and
village
communities
its
growth
was
crippled
by
norman
feudalism
there
as
its
security
here
was
smothered
by
the
east
india
company
but
in
england
it
burst
its
shackles
and
nurtured
a
people
and
a
free
commons
house
here
it
similarly
bourgeoned
out
into
the
congress
activities
and
more
recently
into
those
of
the
muslim
league
now
together
blossoming
into
home
rule
for
india
the
england
of
milton
cromwell
sydney
burke
paine
shelley
wilberforce
gladstone
the
england
that
sheltered
mazzini
kossuth
kropotkin
stepniak
and
that
welcomed
garibaldi
the
england
that
is
the
enemy
of
tyranny
the
foe
of
autocracy
the
lover
of
freedom
that
is
the
england
i
would
fain
here
represent
to
you
when
india
stands
erect
no
suppliant
people
but
a
nation
determined
to
be
free
when
she
stretches
out
her
hand
to
britain
and
offers
friendship
not
subservience
not
obedience
let
me
but
in
spirit
eastern
cradled
in
england
but
indian
by
choice
and
adoption
let
me
stand
as
the
symbol
of
union
between
great
britain
and
india
a
union
of
hearts
and
free
choice
not
of
compulsion
and
therefore
of
a
tie
which
can
not
be
broken
a
tie
of
love
and
of
mutual
helpfulness
beneficial
to
both
nations
and
blessed
by
god
gone
to
the
peace
india
great
leader
dadabhai
naoroji
has
left
his
mortal
body
and
is
now
one
of
the
company
of
the
immortals
who
watch
over
and
aid
progress
he
is
with
bonnerjee
and
ranade
and
hume
and
henry
cotton
and
pherozeshah
mehta
and
gopal
krishna
gokhale
the
great
men
who
in
swinburne
noble
verse
are
the
stars
which
lead
us
to
liberty
altar
these
o
men
shall
ye
honour
liberty
only
and
these
for
thy
sake
and
for
all
men
and
mine
brother
the
crowns
of
them
shine
lighting
the
way
to
her
shrine
that
our
eyes
may
be
fastened
upon
her
that
our
hands
may
encompass
her
knees
not
for
me
to
praise
him
in
feeble
words
of
reverence
or
of
homage
his
deeds
praise
him
and
his
service
to
his
country
is
his
abiding
glory
our
gratitude
will
be
best
paid
by
following
in
his
footsteps
alike
in
his
splendid
courage
and
his
unfaltering
devotion
so
that
we
may
win
the
home
rule
which
he
longed
to
see
while
with
us
and
shall
see
ere
long
from
the
other
world
of

in
which
he
dwells
chapter
military
expenditure
the
great
war
into
the
whirlpool
of
which
nation
after
nation
has
been
drawn
has
entered
on
its
fourth
year
the
rigid
censorship
which
has
been
established
makes
it
impossible
for
any
outside
the
circle
of
governments
to
forecast
its
duration
but
to
me
speaking
for
a
moment
not
as
a
politician
but
as
a
student
of
spiritual
laws
to
me
its
end
is
sure
for
the
true
object
of
this
war
is
to
prove
the
evil
of
and
to
destroy
autocracy
and
the
enslavement
of
one
nation
by
another
and
to
place
on
sure
foundations
the
right
to
and
of
every
nation
and
the
similar
right
of
the
individual
of
the
smaller
self
so
far
as
is
consistent
with
the
welfare
of
the
larger
self
of
the
nation
the
forces
which
make
for
the
prolongation
of
autocracy
the
rule
of
one
and
the
even
deadlier
bureaucracy
the
rule
of
a
close
body
welded
into
an
iron
system
these
have
been
gathered
together
in
the
central
powers
of
europe
as
of
old
in
ravana
in
order
that
they
may
be
destroyed
for
the
new
age
can
not
be
opened
until
the
old
passes
away
the
new
civilisation
of
righteousness
and
justice
and
therefore
of
brotherhood
of
ordered
liberty
of
peace
of
happiness
can
not
be
built
up
until
the
elements
are
removed
which
have
brought
the
old
civilisation
crashing
about
our
ears
therefore
is
it
necessary
that
the
war
shall
be
fought
out
to
its
appointed
end
and
that
no
premature
peace
shall
leave
its
object
unattained
autocracy
and
bureaucracy
must
perish
utterly
in
east
and
west
and
in
order
that
their
germs
may
not
in
the
future
they
must
be
discredited
in
the
minds
of
men
they
must
be
proved
to
be
less
efficient
than
the
governments
of
free
peoples
even
in
their
favourite
work
of
war
and
their
iron
machinery
which
at
first
brings
outer
prosperity
and
success
must
be
shown
to
be
less
lasting
and
effective
than
the
living
and
flexible
organisations
of
democratic
peoples
they
must
be
proved
failures
before
the
world
so
that
the
glamour
of
superficial
successes
may
be
destroyed
for
ever
they
have
had
their
day
and
their
place
in
evolution
and
have
done
their
educative
work
now
they
are
unfit
for
survival
and
must
vanish
away
when
great
britain
sprang
to
arms
it
was
in
defence
of
the
freedom
of
a
small
nation
guaranteed
by
treaties
and
the
great
principles
she
proclaimed
electrified
india
and
the
dominions
they
all
sprang
to
her
side
without
question
without
delay
they
heard
the
voice
of
old
england
the
soldier
of
liberty
and
it
thrilled
their
hearts
all
were
unprepared
save
the
small
territorial
army
of
great
britain
due
to
the
genius
and
foresight
of
lord
haldane
and
the
readily
mobilised
army
of
india
hurled
into
the
fray
by
the
swift
decision
of
lord
hardinge
the
little
army
of
britain
fought
for
time
fought
to
stop
the
road
to
paris
the
heart
of
france
fought
falling
back
step
by
step
and
gained
the
time
it
fought
for
till
india
sons
stood
on
the
soil
of
france
were
flung
to
the
front
rushed
past
the
exhausted
regiments
who
cheered
them
with
failing
breath
charged
the
advancing
hosts
stopped
the
retreat
and
joined
the
british
army
in
forming
that
unbreakable
line
which
wrestled
to
the
death
through
two
fearful
winters
often
these
soldiers
of
the
tropics
in
freezing
mud
and
knew
no
surrender
india
with
her
clear
vision
saw
in
great
britain
the
champion
of
freedom
in
germany
the
champion
of
despotism
and
she
saw
rightly
rightly
she
stood
by
great
britain
despite
her
own
lack
of
freedom
and
the
coercive
legislation
which
outrivalled
german
despotism
knowing
these
to
be
temporary
because
and
therefore
doomed
to
destruction
she
spurned
the
lure
of
german
gold
and
rejected
german
appeals
to
revolt
she
offered
men
and
money
her
educated
classes
her
vakils
offered
themselves
as
volunteers
pleaded
to
be
accepted
then
the
distrust
of
rejected
the
offer
pressed
for
money
rejected
men
and
slowly
educated
india
sank
back
depressed
and
disheartened
and
a
splendid
opportunity
for
knitting
together
the
two
nations
was
lost
early
in
the
war
i
ventured
to
say
that
the
war
could
not
end
until
england
recognised
that
autocracy
and
bureaucracy
must
perish
in
india
as
well
as
in
europe
the
good
bishop
of
calcutta
with
a
courage
worthy
of
his
free
race
lately
declared
that
it
would
be
hypocritical
to
pray
for
victory
over
autocracy
in
europe
and
to
maintain
it
in
india
now
it
has
been
clearly
and
definitely
declared
that
is
to
be
the
objective
of
great
britain
in
india
and
that
a
substantial
measure
of
it
is
to
be
given
at
once
when
this
promise
is
made
good
by
the
granting
of
the
reforms
outlined
last
year
in
lucknow
then
the
end
of
the
war
will
be
in
sight
for
the
war
can
not
end
till
the
of
autocracy
is
sounded
causes
with
which
i
will
deal
presently
and
for
which
india
was
not
responsible
have
somewhat
obscured
the
first
eager
expressions
of
india
sympathy
and
have
forced
her
thoughts
largely
towards
her
own
position
in
the
empire
but
that
does
not
detract
from
the
immense
aid
she
has
given
and
is
still
giving
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
long
before
the
present
war
she
had
submitted
at
first
while
she
had
no
power
of
remonstrance
and
later
after
despite
the
constant
protests
of
congress
to
an
military
expenditure
due
partly
to
the
amalgamation
scheme
of
and
partly
to
the
cost
of
various
wars
beyond
her
frontiers
and
to
continual
recurring
frontier
and
expeditions
in
which
she
had
no
real
interest
they
were
sent
out
for
supposed
imperial
advantages
not
for
her
own
between
and
years
indian
troops
were
engaged
in
wars
and
expeditions
there
were
ten
wars
the
two
chinese
wars
of
and
the
bhutan
war
of
the
abyssinian
war
of
the
afghan
war
of
and
after
the
massacre
of
the
kabul
mission
the
second
war
of
ending
in
an
advance
of
the
frontier
in
the
search
for
an
ever
receding
scientific
frontier
on
this
occasion
the
frontier
was
shifted
says
keene
from
the
line
of
the
indus
to
the
western
slope
of
the
suleiman
range
and
from
peshawar
to
quetta
the
egyptian
war
of
in
which
the
indian
troops
markedly
distinguished
themselves
the
third
burmese
war
of
ending
in
the
annexation
of
upper
burma
in
the
invasions
of
tibet
in
and
of
expeditions
or
minor
wars
there
were
to
sitana
in
on
a
small
scale
and
in
on
a
larger
the
sitana
campaign
to
nepal
and
sikkim
in
to
sikkim
in
a
serious
struggle
on
the
frontier
in
expeditions
against
the
lushais
in
the
daflas
in
the
nagas
in
the
afridis
in
the
rampa
hill
tribes
in
the
waziris
and
nagas
in
the
akhas
in
and
in
the
same
year
an
expedition
to
the
zhob
valley
and
a
second
thither
in
in
and
there
was
another
expedition
against
sikkim
against
the
akozais
the
black
mountain
expedition
and
against
the
hill
tribes
of
the
and
in
another
black
mountain
expedition
with
a
third
in
in
came
the
expedition
to
manipur
and
in
there
was
another
expedition
against
the
lushais
and
one
into
the
miranzal
valley
the
chitral
expedition
occupied
and
the
serious
tirah
campaign
in
which
men
were
engaged
came
in
and
the
long
list
which
i
have
closed
with
ends
with
the
expeditions
against
the
mahsuds
in
against
the
kabalis
in
and
the
invasion
of
tibet
before
noted
all
these
events
explain
the
rise
in
military
expenditure
and
we
must
add
to
them
the
sending
of
indian
troops
to
malta
and
cyprus
in
a
somewhat
theatrical
demonstration
and
the
expenditure
of
some
to
face
what
was
described
as
the
russian
menace
in
most
of
these
were
due
to
imperial
not
to
indian
policy
and
many
of
the
burdens
imposed
were
protested
against
by
the
government
of
india
while
others
were
encouraged
by
ambitious
viceroys
i
do
not
think
that
even
this
long
list
is
complete
ever
since
the
government
of
india
was
taken
over
by
the
crown
india
has
been
regarded
as
an
imperial
military
asset
and
training
ground
a
position
from
which
the
jealousy
of
the
east
india
company
had
largely
protected
her
by
insisting
that
the
army
it
supported
should
be
used
for
the
defence
and
in
the
interests
of
india
alone
her
value
to
the
empire
for
military
purposes
would
not
so
seriously
have
injured
at
once
her
pride
and
her
finances
if
the
natural
tendencies
of
her
martial
races
had
been
permitted
their
previous
scope
but
the
disarming
of
the
people
years
after
the
assumption
of
the
government
by
the
crown
emasculated
the
nation
and
the
elimination
of
races
supposed
to
be
unwarlike
or
in
some
cases
too
warlike
to
be
trusted
threw
recruitment
more
and
more
to
the
north
and
lowered
the
physique
of
the
bengalis
and
madrasis
on
whom
the
company
had
largely
depended
the
superiority
of
the
punjab
on
which
sir
michael
so
vehemently
insisted
the
other
day
is
an
artificial
superiority
created
by
the
british
system
and
policy
and
the
poor
recruitment
elsewhere
on
which
he
laid
offensive
insistence
is
due
to
the
same
system
and
policy
which
largely
eliminated
bengalis
madrasis
and
mahrattas
from
the
army
in
bengal
however
the
martial
type
has
been
revived
chiefly
in
consequence
of
what
the
bengalis
felt
to
be
the
intolerable
insult
of
the
partition
of
bengal
by
lord
curzon
on
this
gopal
krishna
gokhale
said
bengal
heroic
stand
against
the
oppression
of
a
harsh
and
uncontrolled
bureaucracy
has
astonished
and
gratified
all
india
all
india
owes
a
deep
debt
of
gratitude
to
bengal
the
spirit
evoked
showed
itself
in
the
youth
of
bengal
by
a
practical
revolt
led
by
the
elders
while
it
was
confined
to
swadeshi
and
boycott
and
rushing
on
when
it
broke
away
from
their
authority
into
conspiracy
assassination
and
dacoity
as
had
happened
in
similar
revolts
with
young
italy
in
the
days
of
mazzini
and
with
young
russia
in
the
days
of
stepniak
and
kropotkin
the
results
of
their
despair
necessarily
met
by
the
halter
and
penal
servitude
had
to
be
faced
by
lord
hardinge
and
lord
carmichael
during
the
present
war
other
results
happy
instead
of
disastrous
in
their
nature
was
the
development
of
grit
and
endurance
of
a
high
character
shown
in
the
courage
of
the
bengal
lads
in
the
serious
floods
that
have
laid
parts
of
the
province
deep
under
water
and
in
their
compassion
and
in
the
relief
of
famine
their
services
in
the
present
war
the
ambulance
corps
and
the
replacement
of
its
when
the
ship
carrying
it
sank
with
the
splendid
services
rendered
by
it
in
mesopotamia
the
recruiting
of
a
bengali
regiment
for
active
service
strong
with
another
reserves
to
replace
wastage
and
recruiting
still
going
on
these
are
instances
of
the
divine
alchemy
which
brings
the
soul
of
good
out
of
evil
action
and
consecrates
to
service
the
qualities
evoked
by
rebellion
in
england
also
a
similar
result
has
been
seen
in
a
convict
released
to
go
to
the
front
winning
the
victoria
cross
it
would
be
an
act
of
statesmanship
as
well
as
of
divinest
compassion
to
offer
to
every
prisoner
and
interned
captive
held
for
political
crime
or
on
political
suspicion
the
opportunity
of
serving
the
empire
at
the
front
they
might
if
thought
necessary
form
a
separate
battalion
or
a
separate
regiment
under
stricter
supervision
and
yet
be
given
a
chance
of
redeeming
their
reputation
for
they
are
mostly
very
young
the
financial
burden
incurred
in
consequence
of
the
above
conflicts
and
of
other
causes
now
to
be
mentioned
would
not
have
been
so
much
resented
if
it
had
been
imposed
by
india
on
herself
and
if
her
own
sons
had
profited
by
her
being
used
as
a
training
ground
for
the
empire
but
in
this
case
as
in
so
many
others
she
has
shared
imperial
burdens
while
not
sharing
imperial
freedom
and
power
apart
from
this
the
change
which
made
the
army
so
ruinous
a
burden
on
the
resources
of
the
country
was
the
system
of
british
reliefs
the
using
of
india
as
a
training
ground
for
british
regiments
and
the
transfer
of
the
men
thus
trained
to
be
replaced
by
new
ones
under
the
short
service
system
the
cost
of
the
frequent
transfers
and
their
connected
expenses
being
charged
on
the
indian
revenues
while
the
whole
advantage
was
reaped
by
great
britain
on
the
short
service
system
the
simla
army
commission
declared
the
short
service
system
recently
introduced
into
the
british
army
has
increased
the
cost
and
has
materially
reduced
the
efficiency
of
the
british
troops
in
india
we
can
not
resist
the
feeling
that
in
the
introduction
of
this
system
the
interest
of
the
indian
was
entirely
left
out
of
consideration
the
remark
was
certainly
justified
for
the
short
service
system
gave
india
only
five
years
of
the
recruits
she
paid
heavily
for
and
trained
all
the
rest
of
the
benefit
going
to
england
the
latter
was
enabled
as
the
years
went
on
to
enormously
increase
her
reserves
so
that
she
has
had
men
trained
in
and
at
the
cost
of
india
in
the
indian
army
consisted
of
men
with
white
officers
great
changes
were
made
in
including
the
reorganisation
under
lord
kitchener
who
became
at
the
end
of
even
in
this
hasty
review
i
must
not
omit
reference
to
the
fact
that
army
stores
were
drawn
from
britain
at
enormous
cost
while
they
should
have
been
chiefly
manufactured
here
so
that
india
might
have
profited
by
the
expenditure
lately
under
the
necessities
of
war
factories
have
been
turned
to
the
production
of
munitions
but
this
should
have
been
done
long
ago
so
that
india
might
have
been
enriched
instead
of
exploited
the
war
has
forced
an
investigation
into
her
mineral
resources
that
might
have
been
made
for
her
own
sake
but
germany
was
allowed
to
monopolise
the
supply
of
minerals
that
india
could
have
produced
and
worked
up
and
would
have
produced
and
worked
up
had
she
enjoyed
home
rule
india
would
have
been
richer
and
the
empire
safer
had
she
been
a
partner
instead
of
a
possession
but
this
side
of
the
question
will
come
under
the
matters
directly
affecting
merchants
and
we
may
venture
to
express
a
hope
that
the
government
help
extended
to
munition
factories
in
time
of
war
may
be
continued
to
industrial
factories
in
time
of
peace
the
net
result
of
the
various
causes
was
that
the
expense
of
the
indian
army
rose
by
leaps
and
bounds
until
before
the
war
india
was
expending
as
against
the
expended
by
the
united
kingdom
while
the
wealthy
dominions
of
canada
and
australia
were
spending
only
and
millions
respectively
i
am
not
forgetting
that
the
united
kingdom
was
expending
over
on
her
navy
while
india
was
free
of
that
burden
save
for
a
contribution
of
half
a
million
since
the
congress
has
constantly
protested
against
the
military
expenditure
but
the
voice
of
the
congress
was
supposed
to
be
the
voice
of
sedition
and
of
class
ambition
instead
of
being
as
it
was
the
voice
of
educated
indians
the
most
truly
patriotic
and
loyal
class
of
the
population
in
in
the
first
congress
rangiah
naidu
pointed
out
that
military
expenditure
had
been
in
and
had
risen
to
in
wacha
ascribed
the
growth
to
the
amalgamation
scheme
of
and
remarked
that
the
company
in
had
an
army
of
men
at
a
cost
of
millions
while
in
the
crown
had
an
army
of
only
men
at
a
cost
of
millions
the
rise
was
largely
due
to
the
increased
cost
of
the
european
regiments
overland
transport
service
stores
pensions
furlough
allowances
and
the
like
most
of
them
imposed
despite
the
resistance
of
the
government
of
india
which
complained
that
the
changes
were
made
entirely
it
may
be
said
from
imperial
considerations
in
which
indian
interests
have
not
been
consulted
or
advanced
india
paid
nearly
a
year
for
instance
for
home
depots
home
being
england
of
course
in
which
lived
some
to
british
soldiers
on
the
plea
that
their
regiments
not
they
were
serving
in
india
i
can
not
follow
out
the
many
increases
cited
by
wacha
but
members
can
refer
to
his
excellent
speech
fawcett
once
remarked
that
when
the
east
india
company
was
abolished
the
english
people
became
directly
responsible
for
the
government
of
india
it
can
not
i
think
be
denied
that
this
responsibility
has
been
so
imperfectly
discharged
that
in
many
respects
the
new
system
of
government
compares
unfavourably
with
the
old
there
was
at
that
time
an
independent
control
of
expenditure
which
now
seems
to
be
almost
entirely
wanting
shortly
after
the
crown
assumed
the
rule
of
india
disraeli
asked
the
house
of
commons
to
regard
india
as
a
great
and
solemn
trust
committed
to
it
by
an
and
inscrutable
providence
george
yule
in
the
fourth
congress
remarked
on
this
the
odd
members
had
thrown
the
trust
back
upon
the
hands
of
providence
to
be
looked
after
as
providence
itself
thinks
best
perhaps
it
is
time
that
india
should
remember
that
providence
helps
those
who
help
themselves
year
after
year
the
congress
continued
to
remonstrate
against
the
cost
of
the
army
until
in
after
all
the
futile
protests
of
the
intervening
years
it
condemned
an
increase
of
pay
to
british
soldiers
in
india
which
placed
an
additional
burden
on
the
indian
revenues
of
a
year
and
pointed
out
that
the
british
garrison
was
unnecessarily
numerous
as
was
shown
by
the
withdrawal
of
large
bodies
of
british
soldiers
for
service
in
south
africa
and
china
the
very
next
year
congress
protested
that
the
increasing
military
expenditure
was
not
to
secure
india
against
internal
disorder
or
external
attack
but
in
order
to
carry
out
an
imperial
policy
the
colonies
contributed
little
or
nothing
to
the
imperial
military
expenditure
while
india
bore
the
cost
of
about
of
the
whole
british
army
in
addition
to
her
own
indian
troops
surely
these
facts
should
be
remembered
when
military
services
to
the
empire
are
now
being
weighed
in
and
the
congress
declared
that
the
then
military
expenditure
was
beyond
india
power
to
bear
and
in
the
latter
year
prayed
that
the
additional
ten
millions
sterling
sanctioned
for
lord
kitchener
reorganisation
scheme
might
be
devoted
to
education
and
the
reduction
of
the
burden
on
the
raiyats
in
the
burdens
imposed
by
the
british
war
office
since
were
condemned
and
in
the
next
year
it
was
pointed
out
that
the
military
expenditure
was
nearly
a
third
of
the
whole
indian
revenue
and
was
starving
education
and
sanitation
lord
kitchener
reorganisation
scheme
kept
the
indian
army
on
a
war
footing
ready
for
immediate
mobilisation
and
on
january
the
regular
army
consisted
of
men
of
whom
were
english
it
was
the
money
spent
by
india
in
maintaining
this
army
for
years
in
readiness
for
war
which
made
it
possible
for
her
to
go
to
the
help
of
great
britain
at
the
critical
early
period
to
which
i
alluded
she
spent
over
millions
on
the
military
services
in
in
she
spent
millions
in
her
military
budget
had
risen
to
millions
and
it
will
probably
be
exceeded
as
was
the
budget
of
the
preceding
year
by
million
lord
hardinge
the
last
viceroy
of
india
who
is
ever
held
in
loving
memory
here
for
his
sympathetic
attitude
towards
indian
aspirations
made
a
masterly
exposition
of
india
war
services
in
the
house
of
lords
on
the
third
of
last
july
he
emphasised
her
services
showing
that
though
millions
sterling
was
fixed
as
a
maximum
by
the
nicholson
committee
that
amount
had
been
exceeded
in
out
of
the
last
budgets
while
his
own
last
budget
had
risen
to
millions
during
these
years
the
revenue
had
been
only
between
and
millions
once
rising
to
millions
could
any
fact
speak
more
eloquently
of
india
war
services
than
this
proportion
of
military
expenditure
compared
with
her
revenue
the
great
war
began
on
august
and
in
that
very
month
and
in
the
early
part
of
september
india
sent
an
expeditionary
force
of
three
divisions
two
infantry
and
one
cavalry
and
another
cavalry
division
joined
them
in
france
in
november
the
first
arrived
said
lord
hardinge
in
time
to
fill
a
gap
that
could
not
otherwise
have
been
filled
he
added
pathetically
there
are
very
few
survivors
of
those
two
splendid
divisions
of
infantry
truly
their
homes
are
empty
but
their
sons
shall
enjoy
in
india
the
liberty
for
which
their
fathers
died
in
france
three
more
divisions
were
at
once
sent
to
guard
the
indian
frontier
while
in
september
a
mixed
division
was
sent
to
east
africa
and
in
october
and
november
two
more
divisions
and
a
brigade
of
cavalry
went
to
egypt
a
battalion
of
indian
infantry
went
to
mauritius
another
to
the
cameroons
and
two
to
the
persian
gulf
while
other
indian
troops
helped
the
japanese
in
the
capture
of
tsingtau
indians
were
thus
sent
overseas
the
whole
of
these
troops
were
fully
armed
and
equipped
and
in
addition
during
the
first
few
weeks
of
the
war
india
sent
to
england
from
her
magazines
million
rounds
of
ammunition
rifles
and
more
than
guns
of
the
latest
pattern
and
type
in
addition
to
these
lord
hardinge
speaks
of
sending
to
england
enormous
quantities
of
material
tents
boots
saddlery
clothing
but
every
effort
was
made
to
meet
the
demands
made
by
the
war
office
and
it
may
be
stated
without
exaggeration
that
india
was
bled
absolutely
white
during
the
first
few
weeks
of
the
war
it
must
not
be
forgotten
though
lord
hardinge
has
not
reckoned
it
that
all
wastage
has
been
more
than
filled
up
and
men
represent
this
head
the
increase
in
units
has
been
and
including
other
military
items
india
had
placed
in
the
field
up
to
the
end
of
over
a
million
of
men
in
addition
to
this
a
british
force
of
was
sent
from
india
fully
trained
and
equipped
at
indian
cost
india
receiving
in
exchange
many
months
later
territorial
battalions
and
batteries
unfit
for
immediate
employment
on
the
frontier
or
in
mesopotamia
until
they
had
been
entirely
and
equipped
and
their
training
completed
between
the
autumn
of
and
the
close
of
the
defence
of
our
own
frontiers
was
a
serious
matter
and
lord
hardinge
says
the
attitude
of
afghanistan
was
for
a
long
time
doubtful
although
i
always
had
confidence
in
the
personal
loyalty
of
our
ally
the
amir
but
i
feared
lest
he
might
be
overwhelmed
by
a
wave
of
fanaticism
or
by
a
successful
jehad
of
the
tribes
it
suffices
to
mention
that
although
during
the
previous
three
years
there
had
been
no
operations
of
any
importance
on
the
frontier
there
were
between
november
and
september
no
less
than
seven
serious
attacks
on
the
frontier
all
of
which
were
effectively
dealt
with
the
military
authorities
had
also
to
meet
a
german
conspiracy
early
in
men
arriving
from
canada
and
the
united
states
having
planned
to
seize
points
of
military
vantage
in
the
panjab
and
in
december
of
the
same
year
another
german
conspiracy
in
bengal
necessitating
military
preparations
on
land
and
also
naval
patrols
in
the
bay
of
bengal
lord
hardinge
has
been
much
attacked
by
the
tory
and
unionist
press
in
england
and
india
in
england
because
of
the
mesopotamia
report
in
india
because
his
love
for
india
brought
him
hatred
from
india
has
affirmed
her
confidence
in
him
and
with
india
verdict
he
may
well
rest
satisfied
i
do
not
care
to
dwell
on
the
mesopotamia
commission
and
its
condemnation
of
the
bureaucratic
system
prevailing
here
lord
hardinge
vindicated
himself
and
india
the
bureaucratic
system
remains
undefended
i
recall
that
bureaucratic
inefficiency
came
out
in
even
more
startling
fashion
in
connection
with
the
afghan
war
of
and
in
february
the
war
charges
were
reported
as
under
millions
and
the
accounts
showed
a
surplus
of
millions
on
april
the
government
of
india
reported
outgoing
for
war
very
alarming
far
exceeding
estimate
and
on
the
april
it
was
announced
that
the
cash
balances
had
fallen
in
three
months
from
thirteen
crores
to
less
than
nine
owing
to
military
drain
on
the
following
day
april
a
despatch
was
sent
out
to
the
viceroy
showing
that
there
appeared
a
deficiency
of
not
less
than
crores
this
vast
error
was
evidently
due
to
an
underestimate
of
war
liabilities
which
had
led
to
such
being
laid
before
parliament
and
to
the
sudden
discovery
of
inability
to
the
usual
drawings
it
seemed
that
the
government
knew
only
the
amount
audited
not
the
amount
spent
payments
were
entered
as
advances
though
they
were
not
recoverable
and
the
great
negligence
was
evidently
that
of
the
heads
of
departmental
accounts
if
such
a
mishap
should
occur
under
home
rule
a
few
years
hence
which
heaven
forbid
i
shudder
to
think
of
the
comments
of
the
and
the
on
the
shocking
inefficiency
of
indian
officials
in
september
last
our
present
viceroy
lord
chelmsford
defended
india
against
later
attacks
by
critics
who
try
to
minimise
her
sacrifices
in
order
to
lessen
the
gratitude
felt
by
great
britain
towards
her
lest
that
gratitude
should
give
birth
to
justice
and
justice
should
award
freedom
to
india
lord
chelmsford
placed
before
his
council
in
studiously
considered
outline
a
summary
of
what
india
has
done
during
the
past
two
years
omitting
his
references
to
what
was
done
under
lord
hardinge
as
stated
above
i
may
quote
from
him
on
the
outbreak
of
war
of
the
british
officers
on
the
indian
establishment
who
were
at
home
on
leave
were
detained
by
the
war
office
for
service
in
europe
combatant
officers
have
been
withdrawn
from
india
since
the
beginning
of
the
war
excluding
those
who
proceeded
on
service
with
their
batteries
or
regiments
in
order
to
make
good
these
deficiencies
and
provide
for
war
wastage
the
indian
army
reserve
of
officers
was
expanded
from
a
total
of
at
which
it
stood
on
the
august
to
one
of
the
establishment
of
indian
units
has
not
only
been
kept
up
to
strength
but
has
been
considerably
increased
there
has
been
an
augmentation
of
per
cent
in
the
cavalry
and
of
per
cent
in
the
infantry
while
the
number
of
recruits
enlisted
since
the
beginning
of
the
war
is
greater
than
the
entire
strength
of
the
indian
army
as
it
existed
on
august
lord
chelmsford
rightly
pointed
out
the
army
in
india
has
thus
proved
a
great
imperial
asset
and
in
weighing
the
value
of
india
contribution
to
the
war
it
should
be
remembered
that
india
forces
were
no
hasty
improvisation
but
were
an
army
in
being
fully
equipped
and
supplied
which
had
previously
cost
india
annually
a
large
sum
to
maintain
lord
chelmsford
has
established
what
he
calls
a
board
the
duty
of
which
is
to
collect
and
all
the
facts
with
regard
to
the
supply
of
in
india
it
has
branches
in
all
the
provinces
a
steady
flow
of
reinforcements
supplies
the
wastage
at
the
various
fronts
and
the
labour
required
for
engineering
transport
is
now
organised
in
corps
in
mesopotamia
and
corps
in
france
in
addition
artisans
labourers
and
specialists
are
serving
in
mesopotamia
and
east
africa
and
some
menials
and
followers
have
also
gone
overseas
indian
medical
practitioners
have
accepted
temporary
commissions
in
the
indian
medical
service
to
the
number
of
in
view
of
this
fact
due
to
great
britain
bitter
need
of
help
may
we
not
hope
that
this
service
will
welcome
indians
in
time
of
peace
as
well
as
in
time
of
war
and
will
no
longer
bar
the
way
by
demanding
the
taking
of
a
degree
in
the
united
kingdom
it
is
also
worthy
of
notice
that
the
officers
in
charge
of
district
duties
have
been
largely
replaced
by
indian
medical
men
this
again
should
continue
after
the
war
another
fact
that
the
army
reserve
of
officers
his
risen
from
to
suggests
that
the
throwing
open
of
commissions
to
qualified
indians
should
not
be
represented
by
a
meagre
nine
if
english
lads
of
and
are
worthy
of
king
commissions
and
the
long
roll
of
slain
second
lieutenants
proves
it
then
certainly
indian
lads
since
indians
have
fought
as
bravely
as
englishmen
should
find
the
door
thrown
open
to
them
equally
widely
in
their
own
country
and
the
indian
army
should
be
led
by
indian
officers
with
such
a
record
of
deeds
as
the
one
i
have
baldly
sketched
it
is
not
necessary
to
say
much
in
words
as
to
india
support
of
great
britain
and
her
allies
she
has
proved
up
to
the
hilt
her
desire
to
remain
within
the
empire
to
maintain
her
tie
with
great
britain
but
if
britain
is
to
call
successfully
on
india
as
lord
chelmsford
suggests
in
his
board
then
must
the
man
who
fights
or
labours
have
a
man
rights
in
his
own
land
the
lesson
which
springs
out
of
this
war
is
that
it
is
absolutely
necessary
for
the
future
safety
of
the
empire
that
india
shall
have
home
rule
had
her
been
utilised
earlier
there
would
have
been
no
war
for
none
would
have
dared
to
provoke
great
britain
and
india
to
a
contest
but
her
can
not
be
utilised
while
she
is
a
subject
nation
she
can
not
afford
to
maintain
a
large
army
if
she
is
to
support
an
english
garrison
to
pay
for
their
goings
and
comings
to
buy
stores
in
england
at
exorbitant
prices
and
send
them
back
again
when
england
needs
them
she
can
not
afford
to
train
men
for
england
and
only
have
their
services
for
five
years
she
can
not
afford
to
keep
huge
gold
reserves
in
england
and
be
straitened
for
cash
while
she
lends
to
england
out
of
her
reserves
taken
from
her
for
war
expenses
and
this
be
it
remembered
before
the
great
war
loan
i
once
said
in
england
the
condition
of
india
loyalty
is
india
freedom
i
may
now
add
the
condition
of
india
usefulness
to
the
empire
is
india
freedom
she
will
tax
herself
willingly
when
her
taxes
remain
in
the
country
and
fertilise
it
when
they
educate
her
people
and
thus
increase
their
productive
power
when
they
foster
her
trade
and
create
for
her
new
industries
great
britain
needs
india
as
much
as
india
needs
england
for
prosperity
in
peace
as
well
as
for
safety
in
war
montagu
has
wisely
said
that
for
equipment
in
war
a
nation
needs
freedom
in
peace
therefore
i
say
that
for
both
countries
alike
the
lesson
of
the
war
is
home
rule
for
india
let
me
close
this
part
of
my
subject
by
laying
at
the
feet
of
his
imperial
majesty
the
loving
homage
of
the
thousands
here
assembled
with
the
hope
and
belief
that
ere
long
we
shall
lay
there
the
willing
and
grateful
homage
of
a
free
nation
chapter
ii
causes
of
the
new
spirit
in
india
apart
from
the
natural
exchange
of
thought
between
east
and
west
the
influence
of
english
education
literature
and
ideals
the
effect
of
travel
in
europe
japan
and
the
united
states
of
america
and
other
recognised
causes
for
the
changed
outlook
in
india
there
have
been
special
forces
at
work
during
the
last
few
years
to
arouse
a
new
spirit
in
india
and
to
alter
her
attitude
of
mind
these
may
be
summed
up
as
a
the
awakening
of
asia
b
discussions
abroad
on
alien
rule
and
imperial
reconstruction
c
loss
of
belief
in
the
superiority
of
the
white
races
d
the
awakening
of
indian
merchants
e
the
awakening
of
indian
womanhood
to
claim
its
ancient
position
f
the
awakening
of
the
masses
each
of
these
causes
has
had
its
share
in
the
splendid
change
of
attitude
in
the
indian
nation
in
the
uprising
of
a
spirit
of
pride
of
country
of
independence
of
of
dignity
of
the
war
has
quickened
the
rate
of
evolution
of
the
world
and
no
country
has
experienced
the
quickening
more
than
our
motherland
the
awakening
of
asia
in
a
conversation
i
had
with
lord
minto
soon
after
his
arrival
as
viceroy
he
discussed
the
unrest
in
india
and
recognised
it
as
the
inevitable
result
of
english
education
of
english
ideals
of
democracy
of
the
japanese
victory
over
russia
and
of
the
changing
conditions
in
the
outer
world
i
was
therefore
not
surprised
to
read
his
remark
that
he
recognised
frankly
and
publicly
that
new
aspirations
were
stirring
in
the
hearts
of
the
people
that
they
were
part
of
a
larger
movement
common
to
the
whole
east
and
that
it
was
necessary
to
satisfy
them
to
a
reasonable
extent
by
giving
them
a
larger
share
in
the
administration
but
the
present
movement
in
india
will
be
very
poorly
understood
if
it
be
regarded
only
in
connexion
with
the
movement
in
the
east
the
awakening
of
asia
is
part
of
a
which
has
been
quickened
into
marvellous
rapidity
by
the
the
is
towards
democracy
and
for
the
west
dates
from
the
breaking
away
of
the
american
colonies
from
great
britain
consummated
in
and
its
sequel
in
the
french
revolution
of
needless
to
say
that
its
root
was
in
the
growth
of
modern
science
undermining
the
fabric
of
intellectual
servitude
in
the
work
of
the
encyclopaedists
and
in
that
of
rousseau
and
of
thomas
paine
in
the
east
the
swift
changes
in
japan
the
success
of
the
japanese
empire
against
russia
the
downfall
of
the
manchu
dynasty
in
china
and
the
establishment
of
a
chinese
republic
the
efforts
at
improvement
in
persia
hindered
by
the
interference
of
russia
and
great
britain
with
their
growing
ambitions
and
the
creation
of
british
and
russian
spheres
of
influence
depriving
her
of
her
just
liberty
and
now
the
russian
revolution
and
the
probable
rise
of
a
russian
republic
in
europe
and
asia
have
all
entirely
changed
the
conditions
before
existing
in
india
across
asia
beyond
the
himalayas
stretch
free
and
nations
india
no
longer
sees
as
her
asian
neighbours
the
huge
domains
of
a
tsar
and
a
chinese
despot
and
compares
her
condition
under
british
rule
with
those
of
their
subject
populations
british
rule
profited
by
the
comparison
at
least
until
when
the
great
period
of
repression
set
in
but
in
future
unless
india
wins
she
will
look
enviously
at
her
neighbours
and
the
contrast
will
intensify
her
unrest
but
even
if
she
gains
home
rule
as
i
believe
she
will
her
position
in
the
empire
will
imperatively
demand
that
she
shall
be
strong
as
well
as
free
she
becomes
not
only
a
vulnerable
point
in
the
empire
as
the
asian
nations
evolve
their
own
ambitions
and
rivalries
but
also
a
possession
to
be
battled
for
laing
once
said
india
is
the
of
england
a
kamadhenu
in
fact
a
cow
of
plenty
and
if
that
view
should
arise
in
asia
the
ownership
of
the
would
become
a
matter
of
dispute
as
of
old
between
vashishtha
and
vishvamitra
hence
india
must
be
capable
of
both
by
land
and
sea
there
may
be
a
struggle
for
the
primacy
of
asia
for
supremacy
in
the
pacific
for
the
mastery
of
australasia
to
say
nothing
of
the
inevitable
in
which
japan
is
already
endangering
indian
industry
and
indian
trade
while
india
is
unable
to
protect
herself
in
order
to
face
these
larger
issues
with
equanimity
the
empire
requires
a
contented
strong
and
armed
india
able
to
hold
her
own
and
to
aid
the
dominions
especially
australia
with
her
small
population
and
immense
unoccupied
and
undefended
area
india
alone
has
the
which
can
effectively
maintain
the
empire
in
asia
and
it
is
a
a
criminally
policy
not
to
build
up
her
strength
as
a
state
within
the
commonwealth
of
free
nations
under
the
british
crown
the
englishmen
in
india
talk
loudly
of
their
interests
what
can
this
mere
handful
do
to
protect
their
interests
against
attack
in
the
coming
years
only
in
a
free
and
powerful
india
will
they
be
safe
those
who
read
japanese
papers
know
how
strongly
even
during
the
war
they
parade
unchecked
their
sympathies
and
how
likely
after
the
war
is
an
alliance
between
these
two
ambitious
and
warlike
nations
japan
will
come
out
of
the
war
with
her
army
and
navy
unweakened
and
her
trade
immensely
strengthened
every
consideration
of
sane
statesmanship
should
lead
great
britain
to
trust
india
more
than
japan
so
that
the
british
empire
in
asia
may
rest
on
the
sure
foundation
of
indian
loyalty
the
loyalty
of
a
free
and
contented
people
rather
than
be
dependent
on
the
continued
friendship
of
a
possible
future
rival
for
international
friendships
are
governed
by
national
interests
and
are
built
on
quicksands
not
on
rock
englishmen
in
india
must
give
up
the
idea
that
english
dominance
is
necessary
for
the
protection
of
their
interests
amounting
in
to
sterling
they
do
not
claim
to
dominate
the
united
states
of
america
because
they
have
invested
there
they
do
not
claim
to
dominate
the
argentine
republic
because
they
have
invested
there
why
then
should
they
claim
to
dominate
india
on
the
ground
of
their
investment
britons
must
give
up
the
idea
that
india
is
a
possession
to
be
exploited
for
their
own
benefit
and
must
see
her
as
a
friend
an
equal
a
dominion
within
the
empire
a
nation
like
themselves
a
willing
partner
in
the
empire
and
not
a
dependent
the
democratic
movement
in
japan
china
and
russia
in
asia
has
sympathetically
affected
india
and
it
is
idle
to
pretend
that
it
will
cease
to
affect
her
discussions
abroad
on
alien
rule
and
imperial
reconstruction
but
there
are
other
causes
which
have
been
working
in
india
consequent
on
the
british
attitude
against
autocracy
and
in
defence
of
freedom
in
europe
while
her
attitude
to
india
has
until
lately
been
left
in
doubt
therefore
i
spoke
of
a
splendid
opportunity
lost
india
at
first
believed
that
great
britain
was
fighting
for
the
freedom
of
all
nationalities
even
now
asquith
declared
in
his
speech
in
the
house
of
commons
reported
here
last
october
on
the
peace
resolution
of
ramsay
macdonald
that
the
allies
are
fighting
for
nothing
but
freedom
and
an
important
addition
for
nothing
short
of
freedom
in
his
speech
declaring
that
britain
would
stand
by
france
in
her
claim
for
the
restoration
of
he
spoke
of
the
intolerable
degradation
of
a
foreign
yoke
is
such
a
yoke
less
intolerable
less
wounding
to
here
than
in
where
the
rulers
and
the
ruled
are
both
of
european
blood
similar
in
religion
and
habits
as
the
war
went
on
india
slowly
and
unwillingly
came
to
realise
that
the
hatred
of
autocracy
was
confined
to
autocracy
in
the
west
and
that
the
degradation
was
only
regarded
as
intolerable
for
men
of
white
races
that
freedom
was
lavishly
promised
to
all
except
to
india
that
new
powers
were
to
be
given
to
the
dominions
but
not
to
india
india
was
markedly
left
out
of
the
speeches
of
statesmen
dealing
with
the
future
of
the
empire
and
at
last
there
was
plain
talk
of
the
white
empire
the
empire
of
the
five
nations
and
the
coloured
races
were
lumped
together
as
the
wards
of
the
white
empire
doomed
to
an
indefinite
minority
the
peril
was
pressing
the
menace
unmistakable
the
reconstruction
of
the
empire
was
on
the
anvil
what
was
to
be
india
place
therein
the
dominions
were
proclaimed
as
partners
was
india
to
remain
a
dependency
bonar
law
bade
the
dominions
strike
while
the
iron
was
hot
was
india
to
wait
till
it
was
cold
india
saw
her
soldiers
fighting
for
freedom
in
flanders
in
france
in
gallipoli
in
asia
minor
in
china
in
africa
was
she
to
have
no
share
of
the
freedom
for
which
she
fought
at
last
she
sprang
to
her
feet
and
cried
in
the
words
of
one
of
her
noblest
sons
freedom
is
my
birthright
and
i
want
it
the
words
home
rule
became
her
mantram
she
claimed
her
place
in
the
empire
thus
while
she
continued
to
support
and
even
to
increase
her
army
abroad
fighting
for
the
empire
and
poured
out
her
treasures
as
water
for
hospital
ships
war
funds
red
cross
organisations
and
the
gigantic
war
loan
a
dawning
fear
oppressed
her
lest
if
she
did
not
take
order
with
her
own
household
success
in
the
war
for
the
empire
might
mean
decreased
liberty
for
herself
the
recognition
of
the
right
of
the
indian
government
to
make
its
voice
heard
in
imperial
matters
when
they
were
under
discussion
in
an
imperial
conference
was
a
step
in
the
right
direction
but
disappointment
was
felt
that
while
other
countries
were
represented
by
responsible
ministers
the
representation
in
india
case
was
of
the
government
of
a
government
irresponsible
to
her
and
not
the
representative
of
herself
no
fault
was
found
with
the
choice
itself
but
only
with
the
character
of
the
chosen
for
they
were
selected
by
the
government
and
not
by
the
elected
members
of
the
supreme
council
this
defect
in
the
resolution
moved
by
the
hon
khan
bahadur
shafi
on
october
was
pointed
out
by
the
hon
surendranath
bannerji
he
said
my
lord
in
view
of
a
situation
so
full
of
hope
and
promise
it
seems
to
me
that
my
friend
resolution
does
not
go
far
enough
he
pleads
for
representation
at
the
imperial
conference
he
does
not
plead
for
representation
he
urges
that
an
address
be
presented
to
his
majesty
government
through
the
secretary
of
state
for
india
for
official
representation
at
the
imperial
council
my
lord
official
representation
may
mean
little
or
nothing
it
may
indeed
be
attended
with
some
risk
for
i
am
sorry
to
have
to
say
but
say
it
i
must
that
our
officials
do
not
always
see
eye
to
eye
with
us
as
regards
many
great
public
questions
which
affect
this
country
and
indeed
their
views
judged
from
our
standpoint
may
sometimes
seem
adverse
to
our
interests
at
the
same
time
my
lord
i
recognise
the
fact
that
the
imperial
conference
is
an
assemblage
of
officials
pure
and
simple
consisting
of
ministers
of
the
united
kingdom
and
of
the
colonies
but
my
lord
there
is
an
essential
difference
between
them
and
ourselves
in
their
case
the
ministers
are
the
elect
of
the
people
their
organ
and
their
voice
answerable
to
them
for
their
conduct
and
their
proceedings
in
our
case
our
officials
are
public
servants
in
name
but
in
reality
they
are
the
masters
of
the
public
the
situation
may
improve
and
i
trust
it
will
under
the
liberalising
influence
of
your
excellency
beneficent
administration
but
we
must
take
things
as
they
are
and
not
indulge
in
building
castles
in
the
air
which
may
vanish
like
the
baseless
fabric
of
a
vision
it
was
said
to
be
an
event
that
indian
representatives
took
part
in
the
conference
representatives
they
were
but
as
said
of
the
british
government
in
india
not
of
india
whereas
their
colleagues
represented
their
nations
they
did
good
work
none
the
less
for
they
were
able
and
experienced
men
though
they
failed
us
in
the
imperial
preference
conference
and
partially
on
the
indentured
labour
question
yet
we
hope
that
the
presence
in
the
conference
of
men
of
indian
birth
may
prove
to
be
the
proverbial
thin
end
of
the
wedge
and
may
have
convinced
their
colleagues
that
while
india
was
still
a
dependency
india
sons
were
fully
their
equals
the
report
of
the
public
services
commission
though
now
too
obviously
obsolete
to
be
discussed
caused
both
disappointment
and
resentment
for
it
showed
that
in
the
eyes
of
the
majority
of
the
commissioners
english
domination
in
indian
administration
was
to
be
perpetual
and
that
thirty
years
hence
she
would
only
hold
a
pitiful
per
cent
or
the
higher
appointments
in
the
and
the
police
i
can
not
however
mention
that
commission
even
in
passing
without
voicing
india
thanks
to
the
hon
justice
rahim
for
his
rare
courage
in
writing
a
solitary
minute
of
dissent
in
which
he
totally
rejected
the
report
and
laid
down
the
right
principles
which
should
govern
recruitment
for
the
indian
civil
services
india
had
but
three
representatives
on
the
commission
gokhale
died
ere
it
made
its
report
his
end
quickened
by
his
sufferings
during
its
work
by
the
humiliation
of
the
way
in
which
his
countrymen
were
treated
of
abdur
rahim
i
have
already
spoken
the
hon
chaubal
signed
the
report
but
dissented
from
some
of
its
most
important
recommendations
the
whole
report
was
written
before
the
flood
and
it
is
now
merely
an
antiquarian
curiosity
india
for
all
these
reasons
was
forced
to
see
before
her
a
future
of
perpetual
subordination
the
briton
rules
in
great
britain
the
frenchman
in
france
the
american
in
america
each
dominion
in
its
own
area
but
the
indian
was
to
rule
nowhere
alone
among
the
peoples
of
the
world
he
was
not
to
feel
his
own
country
as
his
own
britain
for
the
british
was
right
and
natural
india
for
the
indians
was
wrong
even
seditious
it
must
be
india
for
the
empire
or
not
even
for
the
empire
but
for
the
rest
of
the
empire
careless
of
herself
british
support
for
british
trade
was
patriotic
and
proper
in
britain
swadeshi
goods
for
indians
showed
a
petty
and
spirit
in
india
the
indian
was
to
continue
to
live
perpetually
and
even
thankfully
as
gopal
krishna
gokhale
said
he
lived
now
in
an
atmosphere
of
inferiority
and
to
be
proud
to
be
a
citizen
without
rights
of
the
empire
while
its
other
component
nations
were
to
be
citizens
with
rights
in
their
own
countries
first
and
citizens
of
the
empire
secondarily
just
as
his
trust
in
great
britain
was
strained
nearly
to
breaking
point
came
the
glad
news
of
montagu
appointment
as
secretary
of
state
for
india
of
the
viceroy
invitation
to
him
and
of
his
coming
to
hear
for
himself
what
india
wanted
it
was
a
ray
of
sunshine
breaking
through
the
gloom
confidence
in
great
britain
revived
and
glad
preparation
was
made
to
welcome
the
coming
of
a
friend
the
attitude
of
india
has
changed
to
meet
the
changed
attitude
of
the
governments
of
india
and
great
britain
but
let
none
imagine
that
that
consequential
change
of
attitude
connotes
any
change
in
her
determination
to
win
home
rule
she
is
ready
to
consider
terms
of
peace
but
it
must
be
peace
with
honour
and
honour
in
this
connection
means
freedom
if
this
be
not
granted
an
even
more
vigorous
agitation
will
begin
loss
of
belief
in
the
superiority
of
white
races
the
undermining
of
this
belief
dates
from
the
spreading
of
the
arya
samaj
and
the
theosophical
society
both
bodies
sought
to
lead
the
indian
people
to
a
sense
of
the
value
of
their
own
civilisation
to
pride
in
their
past
creating
in
the
present
and
in
the
future
they
destroyed
the
unhealthy
inclination
to
imitate
the
west
in
all
things
and
taught
discrimination
the
using
only
of
what
was
valuable
in
western
thought
and
culture
instead
of
a
mere
slavish
copying
of
everything
another
great
force
was
that
of
swami
vivekananda
alike
in
his
passionate
love
and
admiration
for
india
and
his
exposure
of
the
evils
resulting
from
materialism
in
the
west
take
the
following
children
of
india
i
am
here
to
speak
to
you
about
some
practical
things
and
my
object
in
reminding
you
about
the
glories
of
the
past
is
simply
this
many
times
have
i
been
told
that
looking
into
the
past
only
degenerates
and
leads
to
nothing
and
that
we
should
look
to
the
future
that
is
true
but
out
of
the
past
is
built
the
future
look
back
therefore
as
far
as
you
can
drink
deep
of
the
eternal
fountains
that
are
behind
and
after
that
look
forward
march
forward
and
make
india
brighter
greater
much
higher
than
she
ever
was
our
ancestors
were
great
we
must
recall
that
we
must
learn
the
elements
of
our
being
the
blood
that
courses
in
our
veins
we
must
have
faith
in
that
blood
and
what
it
did
in
the
past
and
out
of
that
faith
and
consciousness
of
past
greatness
we
must
build
an
india
yet
greater
than
what
she
has
been
and
again
i
know
for
certain
that
millions
i
say
deliberately
millions
in
every
civilised
land
are
waiting
for
the
message
that
will
save
them
from
the
hideous
abyss
of
materialism
into
which
modern
is
driving
them
headlong
and
many
of
the
leaders
of
the
new
social
movements
have
already
discovered
that
vedanta
in
its
highest
form
can
alone
spiritualise
their
social
aspirations
the
process
was
continued
by
the
admiration
of
sanskrit
literature
expressed
by
european
scholars
and
philosophers
but
the
effect
of
these
was
confined
to
the
few
and
did
not
reach
the
many
the
first
great
shock
to
the
belief
in
white
superiority
came
from
the
triumph
of
japan
over
russia
the
facing
of
a
huge
european
power
by
a
comparatively
small
eastern
nation
the
exposure
of
the
weakness
and
rottenness
of
the
russian
leaders
and
the
contrast
with
their
hardy
virile
opponents
ready
to
sacrifice
everything
for
their
country
the
second
great
shock
has
come
from
the
frank
brutality
of
german
theories
of
the
state
and
their
practical
carrying
out
in
the
treatment
of
conquered
districts
and
the
laying
waste
of
evacuated
areas
in
retreat
the
teachings
of
bismarck
and
their
practical
application
in
france
flanders
belgium
poland
and
serbia
have
destroyed
all
the
glamour
of
the
superiority
of
christendom
over
asia
its
vaunted
civilisation
is
seen
to
be
but
a
thin
veneer
and
its
religion
a
matter
of
form
rather
than
of
life
gazing
from
afar
at
the
ghastly
heaps
of
dead
and
the
hosts
of
the
mutilated
at
science
turned
into
devilry
and
ever
inventing
new
tortures
for
rending
and
slaying
asia
may
be
forgiven
for
thinking
that
on
the
whole
she
prefers
her
own
religions
and
her
own
civilisations
but
even
deeper
than
the
outer
tumult
of
war
has
pierced
the
doubt
as
to
the
reality
of
the
ideals
of
liberty
and
nationality
so
loudly
proclaimed
by
the
foremost
western
nations
the
doubt
of
the
honesty
of
their
champions
sir
james
meston
said
truly
a
short
time
ago
that
he
had
never
in
his
long
experience
known
indians
in
so
distrustful
and
suspicious
a
mood
as
that
which
he
met
in
them
and
that
is
so
for
long
years
indians
have
been
chafing
over
the
many
breaches
of
promises
and
pledges
to
them
that
remain
unredeemed
the
maintenance
here
of
a
system
of
political
repression
of
coercive
measures
increased
in
number
and
more
harshly
applied
since
the
carrying
of
the
system
to
a
wider
extent
since
the
war
for
the
sanctity
of
treaties
and
for
the
protection
of
nationalities
has
been
going
on
have
deepened
the
mistrust
a
frank
and
courageous
statesmanship
applied
to
the
honest
carrying
out
of
large
reforms
too
long
delayed
can
alone
remove
it
the
time
for
political
tinkering
is
past
the
time
for
wise
and
definite
changes
is
here
to
these
deep
causes
must
be
added
the
comparison
between
the
progressive
policy
of
some
of
the
indian
states
in
matters
which
most
affect
the
happiness
of
the
people
and
the
slow
advance
made
under
british
administration
the
indian
notes
that
this
advance
is
made
under
the
guidance
of
rulers
and
ministers
of
his
own
race
when
he
sees
that
the
suggestions
made
in
the
people
assembly
in
mysore
are
fully
considered
and
when
possible
given
effect
to
he
realises
that
without
the
forms
of
power
the
members
exercise
more
real
power
than
those
in
our
legislative
councils
he
sees
education
spreading
new
industries
fostered
villagers
encouraged
to
manage
their
own
affairs
and
take
the
burden
of
their
own
responsibility
and
he
wonders
why
indian
incapacity
is
so
much
more
efficient
than
british
capacity
perhaps
after
all
for
indians
indian
rule
may
be
the
best
the
awakening
of
the
merchants
the
awakening
of
indian
womanhood
the
position
of
women
in
the
ancient
aryan
civilisation
was
a
very
noble
one
the
great
majority
married
becoming
as
manu
said
the
light
of
the
home
some
took
up
the
ascetic
life
remained
unmarried
and
sought
the
knowledge
of
brahma
the
story
of
the
rani
damayanti
to
whom
her
husband
ministers
came
when
they
were
troubled
by
the
gambling
that
of
gandhari
in
the
council
of
kings
and
warrior
chiefs
remonstrating
with
her
headstrong
son
in
later
days
of
padmavati
of
chitoor
of
mirabai
of
marwar
the
sweet
poetess
of
tarabai
of
thoda
the
warrior
of
chand
bibi
the
defender
of
ahmednagar
of
ahalya
bai
of
indore
the
great
ruler
all
these
and
countless
others
are
well
known
only
in
the
last
two
or
three
generations
have
indian
women
slipped
away
from
their
place
at
their
husbands
side
and
left
them
unhelped
in
their
public
life
but
even
now
they
wield
great
influence
over
husband
and
son
culture
has
never
forsaken
them
but
the
english
education
of
their
husbands
and
sons
with
the
neglect
of
sanskrit
and
the
vernacular
have
made
a
barrier
between
the
culture
of
the
husband
and
that
of
the
wife
and
has
shut
the
woman
out
from
her
old
sympathy
with
the
larger
life
of
men
while
the
interests
of
the
husband
have
widened
those
of
the
wife
have
narrowed
the
materialising
of
the
husband
tended
also
by
reaction
to
render
the
wife
religion
less
broad
and
wise
the
wish
to
save
their
sons
from
the
materialising
results
of
english
education
awoke
keen
sympathy
among
indian
mothers
with
the
movement
to
make
religion
an
integral
part
of
education
it
was
perhaps
the
first
movement
in
modern
days
which
aroused
among
them
in
all
parts
a
keen
and
living
interest
the
partition
of
bengal
was
bitterly
resented
by
bengali
women
and
was
another
factor
in
the
change
when
the
editor
of
an
extremist
newspaper
was
prosecuted
for
sedition
convicted
and
sentenced
five
hundred
bengali
women
went
to
his
mother
to
show
their
sympathy
not
by
condolences
but
by
congratulations
such
was
the
feeling
of
the
women
of
bengal
then
the
troubles
of
indians
outside
india
roused
the
ever
quick
sympathy
of
indian
women
and
the
attack
in
south
africa
on
the
sacredness
of
indian
marriage
drew
large
numbers
of
them
out
of
their
homes
to
protest
against
the
wrong
the
indentured
labour
question
involving
the
dishonour
of
women
again
moved
them
deeply
and
even
sent
a
deputation
to
the
viceroy
composed
of
women
these
were
perhaps
the
chief
outer
causes
but
deep
in
the
heart
of
india
daughters
arose
the
mother
voice
calling
on
them
to
help
her
to
arise
and
to
be
once
more
mistress
in
her
own
household
indian
women
nursed
on
her
old
literature
with
its
wonderful
ideals
of
womanly
perfection
could
not
remain
indifferent
to
the
great
movement
for
india
liberty
and
during
the
last
few
years
the
hidden
fire
long
burning
in
their
hearts
fire
of
love
to
bharatamata
fire
of
resentment
against
the
lessened
influence
of
the
religion
which
they
passionately
love
instinctive
dislike
of
the
foreigner
as
ruling
in
their
land
have
caused
a
marvellous
awakening
the
strength
of
the
home
rule
movement
is
rendered
tenfold
greater
by
the
adhesion
to
it
of
large
numbers
of
women
who
bring
to
its
helping
the
uncalculating
heroism
the
endurance
the
of
the
feminine
nature
our
league
best
recruits
are
among
the
women
of
india
and
the
women
of
madras
boast
that
they
marched
in
procession
when
the
men
were
stopped
and
that
their
prayers
in
the
temples
set
the
interned
captives
free
home
rule
has
become
so
intertwined
with
religion
by
the
prayers
offered
up
in
the
great
southern
temples
sacred
places
of
pilgrimage
and
spreading
from
them
to
village
temples
and
also
by
its
being
preached
up
and
down
the
country
by
sadhus
and
sannyasins
that
it
has
become
in
the
minds
of
the
women
and
of
the
ever
religious
masses
inextricably
intertwined
with
religion
that
is
in
this
country
the
surest
way
of
winning
alike
the
women
of
the
higher
classes
and
the
men
and
women
villagers
and
that
is
why
i
have
said
that
the
two
words
home
rule
have
become
a
mantram
the
awakening
of
the
masses
chapter
iii
why
india
demands
home
rule
india
demands
home
rule
for
two
reasons
one
essential
and
vital
the
other
less
important
but
necessary
firstly
because
freedom
is
the
birthright
of
every
nation
secondly
because
her
most
important
interests
are
now
made
subservient
to
the
interests
of
the
british
empire
without
her
consent
and
her
resources
are
not
utilised
for
her
greatest
needs
it
is
enough
only
to
mention
the
money
spent
on
her
army
not
for
local
defence
but
for
imperial
purposes
as
compared
with
that
spent
on
primary
education
i
the
vital
reason
what
is
a
nation
is
necessary
to
the
and
dignity
of
a
people
emasculates
a
nation
lowers
its
character
and
lessens
its
capacity
the
wrong
done
by
the
arms
act
which
raja
rampal
singh
voiced
in
the
second
congress
as
a
wrong
which
outweighed
all
the
benefits
of
british
rule
was
its
weakening
and
debasing
effect
on
indian
manhood
we
can
not
he
declared
be
grateful
to
it
for
degrading
our
natures
for
systematically
crushing
out
all
martial
spirit
for
converting
a
race
of
soldiers
and
heroes
into
a
timid
flock
of
sheep
this
was
done
not
by
the
fact
that
a
man
did
not
carry
arms
few
carry
them
in
england
but
that
men
were
deprived
of
the
to
carry
them
a
nation
an
individual
can
not
develop
his
capacities
to
the
utmost
without
liberty
and
this
is
recognised
everywhere
except
in
india
as
mazzini
truly
said
god
has
written
a
line
of
his
thought
over
the
cradle
of
every
people
that
is
its
special
mission
it
can
not
be
cancelled
it
must
be
freely
developed
for
what
is
a
nation
it
is
a
spark
of
the
divine
fire
a
fragment
of
the
divine
life
outbreathed
into
the
world
and
gathering
round
itself
a
mass
of
individuals
men
women
and
children
whom
it
binds
together
into
one
its
qualities
its
powers
in
a
word
its
type
depend
on
the
fragment
of
the
divine
life
embodied
in
it
the
life
which
shapes
it
evolves
it
colours
it
and
makes
it
one
the
magic
of
nationality
is
the
feeling
of
oneness
and
the
use
of
nationality
is
to
serve
the
world
in
the
particular
way
for
which
its
type
fits
it
this
is
what
mazzini
called
its
special
mission
the
duty
given
to
it
by
god
in
its
thus
india
had
the
duty
of
spreading
the
idea
of
dharma
persia
that
of
purity
egypt
that
of
science
greece
that
of
beauty
rome
that
of
law
but
to
render
its
full
service
to
humanity
it
must
develop
along
its
own
lines
and
be
in
its
evolution
it
must
be
itself
and
not
another
the
whole
world
suffers
where
a
nationality
is
distorted
or
suppressed
before
its
mission
to
the
world
is
accomplished
the
cry
for
hence
the
cry
of
a
nation
for
freedom
for
is
not
a
cry
of
mere
selfishness
demanding
more
rights
that
it
may
enjoy
more
happiness
even
in
that
there
is
nothing
wrong
for
happiness
means
fulness
of
life
and
to
enjoy
such
fulness
is
a
righteous
claim
but
the
demand
for
is
a
demand
for
the
evolution
of
its
own
nature
for
the
service
of
humanity
it
is
a
demand
of
the
deepest
spirituality
an
expression
of
the
longing
to
give
its
very
best
to
the
world
hence
dangers
can
not
check
it
nor
threats
appal
nor
offerings
of
greater
pleasures
lure
it
to
give
up
its
demand
for
freedom
in
the
adapted
words
of
a
christian
scripture
it
passionately
cries
what
shall
it
profit
a
nation
if
it
gain
the
whole
world
and
lose
its
own
soul
what
shall
a
nation
give
in
exchange
for
its
soul
better
hardship
and
freedom
than
luxury
and
thraldom
this
is
the
spirit
of
the
home
rule
movement
and
therefore
it
can
not
be
crushed
it
can
not
be
destroyed
it
is
eternal
and
ever
young
nor
can
it
be
persuaded
to
exchange
its
birthright
for
any
mess
of
at
the
hands
of
the
bureaucracy
stunting
the
race
coming
closer
to
the
daily
life
of
the
people
as
individuals
we
see
that
the
character
of
each
man
woman
and
child
is
degraded
and
weakened
by
a
foreign
administration
and
this
is
most
keenly
felt
by
the
best
indians
speaking
on
the
employment
of
indians
in
the
public
services
gopal
krishna
gokhale
said
a
kind
of
dwarfing
or
stunting
of
the
indian
race
is
going
on
under
the
present
system
we
must
live
all
the
days
of
our
life
in
an
atmosphere
of
inferiority
and
the
tallest
of
us
must
bend
in
order
that
the
exigencies
of
the
system
may
be
satisfied
the
upward
impulse
if
i
may
use
such
an
expression
which
every
schoolboy
at
eton
or
harrow
may
feel
that
he
may
one
day
be
a
gladstone
a
nelson
or
a
wellington
and
which
may
draw
forth
the
best
efforts
of
which
he
is
capable
that
is
denied
to
us
the
full
height
to
which
our
manhood
is
capable
of
rising
can
never
be
reached
by
us
under
the
present
system
the
moral
elevation
which
every
people
feel
can
not
be
felt
by
us
our
administrative
and
military
talents
must
gradually
disappear
owing
to
sheer
disuse
till
at
last
our
lot
as
hewers
of
wood
and
drawers
of
water
in
our
own
country
is
stereotyped
the
hon
bhupendranath
basu
has
spoken
on
similar
lines
a
bureaucratic
administration
conducted
by
an
imported
agency
and
centring
all
power
in
its
hands
and
undertaking
all
responsibility
has
acted
as
a
dead
weight
on
the
soul
of
india
stifling
in
us
all
sense
of
initiative
for
the
lack
of
which
we
are
condemned
atrophying
the
nerves
of
action
and
what
is
more
serious
necessarily
dwarfing
in
us
all
feeling
of
in
this
connexion
the
warning
of
lord
salisbury
to
cooper
hill
students
is
significant
no
system
of
government
can
be
permanently
safe
where
there
is
a
feeling
of
inferiority
or
of
mortification
affecting
the
relations
between
the
governing
and
the
governed
there
is
nothing
i
would
more
earnestly
wish
to
impress
upon
all
who
leave
this
country
for
the
purpose
of
governing
india
than
that
if
they
choose
to
be
so
they
are
the
only
enemies
england
has
to
fear
they
are
the
persons
who
can
if
they
will
deal
a
blow
of
the
deadliest
character
at
the
future
rule
of
england
i
have
ventured
to
urge
this
danger
which
has
increased
of
late
years
in
consequence
of
the
growing
of
the
indians
but
the
ostrich
policy
is
thought
to
be
preferable
in
my
part
of
the
country
this
stunting
of
the
race
begins
with
the
education
of
the
child
the
schools
differentiate
between
british
and
indian
teachers
the
colleges
do
the
same
the
students
see
indians
superseded
by
young
and
foreigners
the
principal
of
a
college
should
be
a
foreigner
foreign
history
is
more
important
than
indian
to
have
written
on
english
villages
is
a
qualification
for
teaching
economics
in
india
the
whole
atmosphere
of
the
school
and
college
emphasises
the
superiority
of
the
foreigner
even
when
the
professors
abstain
from
open
assertion
thereof
the
education
department
controls
the
education
given
and
it
is
planned
on
foreign
models
and
its
object
is
to
serve
foreign
rather
than
native
ends
to
make
docile
government
servants
rather
than
patriotic
citizens
high
spirits
courage
are
not
encouraged
and
docility
is
regarded
as
the
most
precious
quality
in
the
student
pride
in
country
patriotism
ambition
are
looked
on
as
dangerous
and
english
instead
of
indian
ideals
are
exalted
the
blessings
of
a
foreign
rule
and
the
incapacity
of
indians
to
manage
their
own
affairs
are
constantly
inculcated
what
wonder
that
boys
thus
trained
often
turn
out
as
men
and
sycophants
and
finding
their
legitimate
ambitions
frustrated
become
selfish
and
care
little
for
the
public
weal
their
own
inferiority
has
been
so
driven
into
them
during
their
most
impressionable
years
that
they
do
not
even
feel
what
asquith
called
the
intolerable
degradation
of
a
foreign
yoke
india
rights
it
is
not
a
question
whether
the
rule
is
good
or
bad
german
efficiency
in
germany
is
far
greater
than
english
efficiency
in
england
the
germans
were
better
fed
had
more
amusements
and
leisure
less
crushing
poverty
than
the
english
but
would
any
englishman
therefore
desire
to
see
germans
occupying
all
the
highest
positions
in
england
why
not
because
the
righteous
and
dignity
of
the
free
man
revolt
against
foreign
domination
however
superior
as
asquith
said
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
such
a
condition
was
inconceivable
and
would
be
intolerable
why
then
is
it
the
one
conceivable
system
here
in
india
why
is
it
not
felt
by
all
indians
to
be
intolerable
it
is
because
it
has
become
a
habit
bred
in
us
from
childhood
to
regard
the
as
our
natural
superiors
and
the
greatest
injury
british
rule
has
done
to
indians
is
to
deprive
them
of
the
natural
instinct
born
in
all
free
peoples
the
feeling
of
an
inherent
right
to
to
be
themselves
indian
dress
indian
food
indian
ways
indian
customs
are
all
looked
on
as
indian
and
indian
literature
can
not
make
an
educated
man
indians
as
well
as
englishmen
take
it
for
granted
that
the
natural
rights
of
every
nation
do
not
belong
to
them
they
claim
a
larger
share
in
the
government
of
the
country
instead
of
claiming
the
government
of
their
own
country
and
they
are
expected
to
feel
grateful
for
boons
for
concessions
britain
is
to
say
what
she
will
give
the
whole
thing
is
wrong
irrational
thank
god
that
india
eyes
are
opening
that
myriads
of
her
people
realise
that
they
are
men
with
a
man
right
to
freedom
in
his
own
country
a
right
to
manage
his
own
affairs
india
is
no
longer
on
her
knees
for
boons
she
is
on
her
feet
for
rights
it
is
because
i
have
taught
this
that
the
english
in
india
misunderstand
me
and
call
me
seditious
it
is
because
i
have
taught
this
that
i
am
president
of
this
congress
this
may
seem
strong
language
because
the
plain
truth
is
not
usually
put
in
india
but
this
is
what
every
briton
feels
in
britain
for
his
own
country
and
what
every
indian
should
feel
in
india
for
his
this
is
the
freedom
for
which
the
allies
are
fighting
this
is
democracy
the
spirit
of
the
age
and
this
is
what
every
true
briton
will
feel
is
right
the
moment
india
claims
it
for
herself
as
she
is
claiming
it
now
when
this
right
is
gained
then
will
the
tie
between
india
and
great
britain
become
a
golden
link
of
mutual
love
and
service
and
the
iron
chain
of
a
foreign
yoke
will
fall
away
we
shall
live
and
work
side
by
side
with
no
sense
of
distrust
and
dislike
working
as
brothers
for
common
ends
and
from
that
union
shall
arise
the
mightiest
empire
or
rather
commonwealth
that
the
world
has
ever
known
a
commonwealth
that
in
god
good
time
shall
put
an
end
to
war
ii
the
secondary
reasons
tests
of
efficiency
the
secondary
reasons
for
the
present
demand
for
home
rule
may
be
summed
up
in
the
blunt
statement
the
present
rule
while
efficient
in
less
important
matters
and
in
those
which
concern
british
interests
is
inefficient
in
the
greater
matters
on
which
the
healthy
life
and
happiness
of
the
people
depend
looking
at
outer
things
such
as
external
order
posts
and
telegraphs
except
where
political
agitators
are
concerned
main
roads
railways
foreign
visitors
who
expected
to
find
a
country
hold
up
their
hands
in
admiration
but
if
they
saw
the
life
of
the
people
the
masses
of
struggling
clerks
trying
to
educate
their
children
on
rs
a
month
the
masses
of
labourers
with
one
meal
a
day
and
the
huts
in
which
they
live
they
would
find
cause
for
thought
and
if
the
educated
men
talked
freely
with
them
they
would
be
surprised
at
their
bitterness
gopal
krishna
gokhale
put
the
whole
matter
very
plainly
in
one
of
the
fundamental
conditions
of
the
peculiar
position
of
the
british
government
in
this
country
is
that
it
should
be
a
continuously
progressive
government
i
think
all
thinking
men
to
whatever
community
they
belong
will
accept
that
now
i
suggest
four
tests
to
judge
whether
the
government
is
progressive
and
further
whether
it
is
continuously
progressive
the
first
test
that
i
would
apply
is
what
measures
it
adopts
for
the
moral
and
material
improvement
of
the
mass
of
the
people
and
under
these
measures
i
do
not
include
those
appliances
of
modern
governments
which
the
british
government
has
applied
in
this
country
because
they
were
appliances
necessary
for
its
very
existence
though
they
have
benefited
the
people
such
as
the
construction
of
railways
the
introduction
of
post
and
telegraphs
and
things
of
that
kind
by
measures
for
the
moral
and
material
improvement
of
the
people
i
mean
what
the
government
does
for
education
what
the
government
does
for
sanitation
what
the
government
does
for
agricultural
development
and
so
forth
that
is
my
first
test
the
second
test
that
i
would
apply
is
what
steps
the
government
takes
to
give
us
a
larger
share
in
the
administration
of
our
local
affairs
in
municipalities
and
local
boards
my
third
test
is
what
voice
the
government
gives
us
in
its
councils
in
those
deliberate
assemblies
where
policies
are
considered
and
lastly
we
must
consider
how
far
indians
are
admitted
into
the
ranks
of
the
public
service
a
change
of
system
needed
those
were
gokhale
tests
and
indians
can
supply
the
results
of
their
knowledge
and
experience
to
answer
them
but
before
dealing
with
the
failure
to
meet
these
tests
it
is
necessary
to
state
here
that
it
is
not
a
question
of
blaming
men
or
of
substituting
indians
for
englishmen
but
of
changing
the
system
itself
it
is
a
commonplace
that
the
best
men
become
corrupted
by
the
possession
of
irresponsible
power
as
bernard
houghton
says
the
possession
of
unchecked
power
corrupts
some
of
the
finer
qualities
officials
quite
honestly
come
to
believe
that
those
who
try
to
change
the
system
are
undermining
the
security
of
the
state
they
identify
the
state
with
themselves
so
that
criticism
of
them
is
seen
as
treason
to
the
state
the
phenomenon
is
well
known
in
history
and
it
is
only
repeating
itself
in
india
the
same
writer
i
prefer
to
use
his
words
rather
than
my
own
for
he
expresses
exactly
my
own
views
and
will
not
be
considered
to
be
prejudiced
as
i
am
thought
to
be
cogently
remarks
he
the
official
has
become
an
expert
in
reports
and
returns
and
matters
of
routine
through
many
years
of
practice
they
are
the
very
woof
and
warp
of
his
brain
he
has
no
ideas
only
reflexes
he
views
with
acrid
disfavour
untried
conceptions
from
being
constantly
preoccupied
with
the
manipulation
of
the
machine
he
regards
its
smooth
working
the
ordered
and
harmonious
regulation
of
glittering
pieces
of
machinery
as
the
highest
service
he
can
render
to
the
country
of
his
adoption
he
determines
that
his
particular
at
least
shall
be
bright
smooth
silent
and
with
absolutely
no
not
unnaturally
in
course
of
time
he
comes
to
envisage
the
world
through
the
strait
embrasure
of
an
office
window
when
perforce
he
must
report
on
new
proposals
he
will
place
in
the
forefront
not
their
influence
on
the
life
and
progress
of
the
people
but
their
convenience
to
the
official
hierarchy
and
the
manner
in
which
they
affect
its
authority
like
the
monks
of
old
or
the
squire
in
the
typical
english
village
he
cherishes
a
benevolent
interest
in
the
commonalty
and
is
quite
willing
even
eager
to
take
a
general
interest
in
their
welfare
if
only
they
do
not
display
initiative
or
assert
themselves
in
opposition
to
himself
or
his
order
there
is
much
in
this
proviso
having
come
to
regard
his
own
judgment
as
almost
divine
and
the
hierarchy
of
which
he
has
the
honour
to
form
a
part
as
a
sacrosanct
institution
he
tolerates
the
laity
so
long
as
they
labour
quietly
and
peaceably
at
their
vocations
and
do
not
presume
to
in
high
matters
of
state
that
is
the
heinous
offence
and
frank
criticism
of
official
acts
touches
a
lower
depth
still
even
for
no
official
will
endure
criticism
from
his
subordinates
and
the
public
who
lie
in
outer
darkness
beyond
the
pale
do
not
in
his
estimation
rank
even
with
his
subordinates
how
then
should
he
listen
with
patience
when
in
their
cavilling
way
they
insinuate
that
in
spite
of
the
labours
of
a
bureaucracy
all
is
perhaps
not
for
the
best
in
the
best
of
all
possible
worlds
still
less
when
they
suggest
reforms
that
had
never
occurred
even
to
him
or
to
his
order
and
may
clash
with
his
most
cherished
ideals
it
is
for
the
officials
to
govern
the
country
they
alone
have
been
initiated
into
the
sacred
mysteries
they
alone
understand
the
secret
working
of
the
machine
at
the
utmost
the
laity
may
tender
respectful
and
humble
suggestions
for
their
consideration
but
no
more
as
for
those
who
dare
to
think
and
act
for
themselves
their
ignorant
folly
is
only
equalled
by
their
arrogance
it
is
as
though
a
handful
of
schoolboys
were
to
dictate
to
their
masters
alterations
in
the
traditional
or
to
insist
on
a
modified
curriculum
these
worthy
people
officials
confuse
manly
independence
with
disloyalty
they
can
not
conceive
of
natives
except
either
as
rebels
or
as
timid
sheep
the
problem
becomes
more
complicated
by
the
existence
in
india
of
a
small
but
powerful
body
of
the
same
race
as
the
higher
officials
there
are
only
persons
in
this
country
while
there
are
in
the
british
raj
and
another
in
the
indian
states
more
or
less
affected
by
british
influence
as
a
rule
the
do
not
take
any
part
in
politics
being
otherwise
occupied
but
they
enter
the
field
when
any
hope
arises
in
indian
hearts
of
changes
really
beneficial
to
the
nation
john
stuart
mill
observed
on
this
point
the
individuals
of
the
ruling
people
who
resort
to
the
foreign
country
to
make
their
fortunes
are
of
all
others
those
who
most
need
to
be
held
under
powerful
restraint
they
are
always
one
of
the
chief
difficulties
of
the
government
armed
with
the
prestige
and
filled
with
the
scornful
overbearingness
of
the
conquering
nation
they
have
the
feelings
inspired
by
absolute
power
without
its
sense
of
responsibility
similarly
sir
john
lawrence
wrote
the
difficulty
in
the
way
of
the
government
of
india
acting
fairly
in
these
matters
is
immense
if
anything
is
done
or
attempted
to
be
done
to
help
the
natives
a
general
howl
is
raised
which
reverberates
in
england
and
finds
sympathy
and
support
there
i
feel
quite
bewildered
sometimes
what
to
do
everyone
is
in
the
abstract
for
justice
moderation
and
suchlike
excellent
qualities
but
when
one
comes
to
apply
such
principles
so
as
to
affect
anybody
interests
then
a
change
comes
over
them
keene
speaking
of
the
principle
of
treating
equally
all
classes
of
the
community
says
the
application
of
that
maxim
however
could
not
be
made
without
sometimes
provoking
opposition
among
the
handful
of
white
settlers
in
india
who
even
when
not
connected
with
the
administration
claimed
a
kind
of
class
ascendancy
which
was
not
only
in
the
conditions
of
the
country
but
also
in
the
nature
of
the
case
it
was
perhaps
natural
that
in
a
land
of
caste
the
compatriots
of
the
rulers
should
become
as
lord
lytton
said
a
kind
of
white
brahmanas
and
it
was
certain
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
pride
of
race
and
the
possession
of
western
civilisation
created
a
sense
of
superiority
the
display
of
which
was
ungraceful
and
even
dangerous
when
not
tempered
by
official
responsibility
this
feeling
had
been
sensitive
enough
in
the
days
of
lord
william
bentinck
when
the
class
referred
to
was
small
in
numbers
and
devoid
of
influence
it
was
now
both
more
numerous
and
by
reason
of
its
connection
with
the
newspapers
of
calcutta
and
of
london
it
was
far
better
able
to
make
its
passion
heard
during
lord
ripon
sympathetic
administration
the
great
outburst
occurred
against
the
ilbert
bill
in
we
are
face
to
face
with
a
similar
phenomenon
when
we
see
the
european
associations
under
the
leadership
of
the
the
of
calcutta
the
allahabad
the
and
military
of
lahore
with
their
tory
and
unionist
allies
in
the
london
press
and
with
the
aid
of
retired
indian
officials
and
in
england
desperately
resisting
the
reforms
now
proposed
their
opposition
we
know
is
a
danger
to
the
movement
towards
freedom
and
even
when
they
have
failed
to
impress
england
as
they
are
evidently
failing
they
will
try
to
minimise
or
smother
here
the
reforms
which
a
statute
has
embodied
the
reforms
were
thus
robbed
of
their
usefulness
and
a
similar
attempt
if
not
guarded
against
will
be
made
when
the
scheme
is
used
as
the
basis
for
an
act
the
on
england
we
can
not
leave
out
of
account
here
the
deadly
harm
done
to
england
herself
by
this
system
of
rule
in
india
hobson
has
pointed
out
as
our
free
colonies
have
furnished
hope
encouragement
and
leading
to
the
popular
aspirations
in
great
britain
not
merely
by
practical
success
in
the
art
of
but
by
the
wafting
of
a
spirit
of
freedom
and
equality
so
our
despotically
ruled
dependencies
have
ever
served
to
damage
the
character
of
our
people
by
feeding
the
habits
of
snobbish
subservience
the
admiration
of
wealth
and
rank
the
corrupt
survivals
of
the
inequalities
of
feudalism
cobden
writing
in
of
our
indian
empire
put
this
pithy
question
is
it
not
just
possible
that
we
may
become
corrupted
at
home
by
the
reaction
of
arbitrary
political
maxims
in
the
east
upon
our
domestic
politics
just
as
greece
and
rome
were
demoralised
by
their
contact
with
asia
not
merely
is
the
reaction
possible
it
is
inevitable
as
the
despotic
portion
of
our
empire
has
grown
in
area
a
large
number
of
men
trained
in
the
temper
and
methods
of
autocracy
as
soldiers
and
civil
officials
in
our
crown
colonies
protectorates
and
indian
empire
reinforced
by
numbers
of
merchants
planters
engineers
and
overseers
whose
lives
have
been
those
of
a
superior
caste
living
an
artificial
life
removed
from
all
the
healthy
restraints
of
ordinary
european
society
have
returned
to
this
country
bringing
back
the
characters
sentiments
and
ideas
imposed
by
this
foreign
environment
it
is
a
little
hard
on
the
that
they
should
be
foreigners
here
and
then
when
they
return
to
their
native
land
find
that
they
have
become
foreigners
there
by
the
corrupting
influences
with
which
they
are
surrounded
here
we
import
them
as
raw
material
to
our
own
disadvantage
and
when
we
export
them
as
manufactured
here
great
britain
and
india
alike
suffer
from
their
reactionary
tendencies
the
results
are
unsatisfactory
to
both
sides
the
first
test
applied
let
us
now
apply
gokhale

what
has
the
bureaucracy
done
for
education
sanitation
agricultural
improvement
and
so
forth
i
must
put
the
facts
very
briefly
but
they
are
indisputable
the
percentage
to
the
whole
population
of
children
receiving
education
is
the
percentage
having
risen
by
since
gokhale
moved
his
education
bill
six
years
ago
the
percentage
of
children
of
age
attending
school
is
in
the
government
of
india
put
the
number
of
pupils
at
millions
this
has
been
accomplished
in
years
reckoning
from
sir
charles
educational
despatch
in
which
led
to
the
formation
of
the
education
department
in
an
education
act
was
passed
in
great
britain
the
condition
of
education
in
england
then
much
resembling
our
present
position
in
england
had
been
given
since
chiefly
to
church
schools
between
and
free
and
compulsory
education
was
established
and
in
years
the
attendance
rose
from
to
nearly
per
cent
there
are
now
children
in
the
schools
of
england
and
wales
out
of
a
population
of
millions
japan
before
had
a
proportion
of
per
cent
of
children
of
age
in
school
nearly
over
our
present
proportion
in
years
the
percentage
was
raised
to
and
in
years
education
was
free
and
compulsory
in
baroda
education
is
free
and
largely
compulsory

i
am
quoting
gokhale
figures
he
ironically
calculated
that
if
the
population
did
not
increase
every
boy
would
be
in
school
years
hence
and
every
girl
in
years
brother
delegates
we
hope
to
do
it
more
quickly
under
home
rule
i
submit
that
in
education
the
bureaucracy
is
inefficient
and
medical
the
prevalence
of
plague
cholera
and
above
all
malaria
shows
the
lack
of
sanitation
alike
in
town
and
country
this
lack
is
one
of
the
causes
contributing
to
the
low
average
in
india
years
in
england
the
is
years
in
new
zealand
the
chief
difficulty
in
the
way
of
the
treatment
of
disease
is
the
encouragement
of
the
foreign
system
of
medicine
especially
in
rural
parts
and
the
withholding
of
grants
from
the
indigenous
government
hospitals
government
dispensaries
government
doctors
must
all
be
on
the
foreign
system
ayurvaidic
and
unani
medicines
hospitals
dispensaries
physicians
are
unrecognised
and
to
cover
the
latter
is
infamous
conduct
travancore
gives
to
vaidyashalas
at
which
patients
more
than
in
allopathic
institutions
were
treated
in
the
report
issued
in
our
government
can
not
grapple
with
the
medical
needs
of
the
people
yet
will
not
allow
the
people
money
to
be
spent
on
the
systems
they
prefer
under
home
rule
the
indigenous
and
the
foreign
systems
will
be
treated
with
impartiality
i
grant
that
the
allopathic
doctors
do
their
utmost
to
supply
the
need
and
show
great
but
the
need
is
too
vast
and
the
numbers
too
few
efficiency
on
their
own
lines
in
this
matter
is
therefore
impossible
for
our
bureaucratic
government
their
fault
lies
in
excluding
the
indigenous
systems
which
they
have
not
condescended
to
examine
before
rejecting
them
the
result
is
that
in
sanitation
and
medical
relief
the
bureaucracy
is
inefficient
the
census
of
gives
the
agricultural
population
at
millions
its
frightful
poverty
is
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
its
load
of
indebtedness
has
been
dwelt
on
for
at
least
the
last
thirty
odd
years
by
sir
dinshaw
wacha
yet
the
increasing
debt
is
accompanied
with
increasing
taxation
land
revenue
having
risen
as
just
stated
in
years
by
crores
of
rupees
in
addition
to
this
there
are
local
cesses
salt
tax
etc
the
salt
tax
which
presses
most
hardly
on
the
very
poor
was
raised
in
the
last
budget
by
rs
millions
the
inevitable
result
of
this
poverty
is
malnutrition
resulting
in
low

of

according

authority
sir

millions
of
people
in

do
not
know
what
it
is
to
have
their
hunger
fully
satisfied
even
once
in
the
whole
course
of
the
year
the
poverty
of
the
people
of
india
thus
considered
by
itself
is
truly
appalling
and
if
this
is
the
state
of
things
after
a
hundred
years
of
your
rule
you
can
not
claim
that
your
principal
aim
in
india
has
been
the
promotion
of
the
interests
of
the
indian
people
it
is
sometimes
said
why
harp
on
these
figures
we
know
them
our
answer
is
that
the
fact
is
ever
harping
in
the
stomach
of
the
people
and
while
it
continues
we
can
not
cease
to
draw
attention
to
it
and
gokhale
urged
that
even
this
deplorable
condition
has
been
further
deteriorating
steadily
we
have
no
figures
on
malnutrition
among
the
peasantry
but
in
madras
city
among
an
equally
poor
urban
population
we
found
that
per
cent
of
our
pupils
were
reported
after
a
medical
inspection
to
be
suffering
from
malnutrition
and
the
spareness
of
frame
the
thinness
of
arms
and
legs
the
pitiably
weak
grip
on
life
speak
without
words
to
the
seeing
eye
it
needs
an
extraordinary
lack
of
imagination
not
to
suffer
while
these
things
are
going
on
the
peasants
grievances
are
many
and
have
been
voiced
year
after
year
by
this
congress
the
forest
laws
made
by
legislators
inappreciative
of
village
difficulties
press
hardly
on
them
and
only
in
a
small
number
of
places
have
forest
panchayats
been
established
in
the
few
cases
in
which
the
experiment
has
been
made
the
results
have
been
good
in
some
cases
marvellously
good
the
paucity
of
grazing
grounds
for
their
cattle
the
lack
of
green
manure
to
feed
their
impoverished
lands
the
absence
of
fencing
round
forests
so
that
the
cattle
stray
in
when
feeding
are
impounded
and
have
to
be
redeemed
the
fines
and
other
punishments
imposed
for
offences
the
want
of
wood
for
fuel
for
tools
for
repairs
the
uncertain
distribution
of
the
available
water
all
these
troubles
are
discussed
in
villages
and
in
local
conferences
the
arms
act
oppresses
them
by
leaving
them
defenceless
against
wild
beasts
and
wild
men
the
union
of
judicial
and
executive
functions
makes
justice
often
inaccessible
and
always
costly
both
in
money
and
in
time
the
village
officials
naturally
care
more
to
please
the
tahsildar
and
the
collector
than
the
villagers
to
whom
they
are
in
no
way
responsible
and
factions
flourish
because
there
is
always
a
third
party
to
whom
to
resort
who
may
be
flattered
if
his
rank
be
high
bribed
if
it
be
low
whose
favour
can
be
gained
in
either
case
by
cringing
and
by
subservience
and
as
regards
the
condition
of
agriculture
in
india
and
the
poverty
of
the
agricultural
population
the
bureaucracy
is
inefficient
the
application
of
gokhale
first
test
to
indian
handicrafts
to
the
strengthening
of
weak
industries
and
the
creation
of
new
to
the
care
of
waterways
for
traffic
and
of
the
coast
transport
shipping
the
protection
of
indigo
and
other
indigenous
dyes
against
their
german
synthetic
rivals
would
show
similar
answers
we
are
suffering
now
from
the
supineness
of
the
bureaucracy
as
regards
the
development
of
the
resources
of
the
country
by
its
careless
indifference
to
the
usurping
by
germans
of
some
of
those
resources
and
even
now
they
are
pursuing
a
similar
policy
of
towards
japanese
enterprise
which
leaning
on
its
own
government
is
taking
the
place
of
germany
in
shouldering
indians
out
of
their
own
natural
heritage
in
all
prosperous
countries
crafts
are
found
side
with
agriculture
and
they
lend
each
other
mutual
support
the
extreme
poverty
of
ireland
and
the
loss
of
more
than
half
its
population
by
emigration
were
the
direct
results
of
the
destruction
of
its
by
great
britain
and
the
consequent
throwing
of
the
population
entirely
on
the
land
for
subsistence
a
similar
phenomenon
has
resulted
here
from
a
similar
case
but
on
a
far
more
widespread
scale
and
here
a
novel
and
portentous
change
for
india
a
considerable
landless
class
is
developing
which
involves
economic
danger
as
the
remarks
comparing
the
census
returns
of
and
the
ordinary
agricultural
labourers
are
employed
on
the
land
only
during
the
busy
seasons
of
the
year
and
in
slack
times
a
few
are
attracted
to
large
for
temporary
work
one
recalls
the
influx
into
england
of
irish
labourers
at
harvest
time
professor
radkamal
mukerji
has
laid
stress
on
the
older
conditions
of
village
life
he
says
the
village
is
still
almost
and
is
in
itself
an
economic
unit
the
village
agriculturist
grows
all
the
food
necessary
for
the
inhabitants
of
the
village
the
smith
makes
the
for
the
cultivator
and
the
few
iron
utensils
required
for
the
household
he
supplies
these
to
the
people
but
does
not
get
money
in
return
he
is
recompensed
by
mutual
services
from
his
fellow
villagers
the
potter
supplies
him
with
pots
the
weaver
with
cloth
and
the
oilman
with
oil
from
the
cultivator
each
of
these
artisans
receives
his
traditional
share
of
grain
thus
almost
all
the
economic
transactions
are
carried
on
without
the
use
of
money
to
the
villagers
money
is
only
a
store
of
value
not
a
medium
of
exchange
when
they
happen
to
be
rich
in
money
they
hoard
it
either
in
coins
or
make
ornaments
made
of
gold
and
silver
these
conditions
are
changing
in
consequence
of
the
pressure
of
poverty
driving
the
villagers
to
the
city
where
they
learn
to
substitute
the
competition
of
the
town
for
the
mutual
helpfulness
of
the
village
the
difference
of
feeling
the
change
from
trustfulness
to
suspicion
may
be
seen
by
visiting
villages
which
are
in
the
vicinity
of
a
town
and
comparing
their
villagers
with
those
who
inhabit
villages
in
purely
rural
areas
this
economic
and
moral
deterioration
can
only
be
checked
by
the
of
a
healthy
village
life
and
this
depends
upon
the
of
the
panchayat
as
the
unit
of
government
a
question
which
i
deal
with
presently
village
industries
would
then
revive
and
an
intercommunicating
network
would
be
formed
by
societies
ramaswami
aiyar
says
in
his
pamphlet
societies
and
the
one
method
by
which
this
evil
emigration
to
towns
can
be
arrested
and
the
economic
and
social
standards
of
life
of
the
rural
people
elevated
is
by
the
inauguration
of
healthy
panchayats
in
conjunction
with
the
foundation
of
institutions
which
will
have
the
effect
of
resuscitating
village
industries
and
of
creating
organised
social
forces
the
indian
village
when
rightly
reconstructed
would
be
an
excellent
foundation
for
industrial
organisation
again
the
resuscitation
of
the
village
system
has
other
bearings
not
usually
considered
in
connection
with
the
general
subject
of
the
inauguration
of
the
panchayat
system
one
of
the
most
important
of
these
is
the
regeneration
of
the
small
industries
of
the
land
both
in
europe
and
in
india
the
decline
of
small
industries
has
gone
on
with
the
decline
of
farming
on
a
small
scale
in
countries
like
france
agriculture
has
largely
supported
village
industries
and
small
cultivators
in
that
country
have
turned
their
attention
to
industry
as
a
supplementary
source
of
livelihood
the
decline
of
village
life
in
india
is
not
only
a
political
but
also
an
economic
and
industrial
problem
whereas
in
europe
the
cultural
impulse
has
travelled
from
the
city
to
the
village
in
india
the
reverse
has
been
the
case
the
centre
of
social
life
in
this
country
is
the
village
and
not
the
town
ours
was
essentially
the
cottage
industry
and
our
artisans
still
work
in
their
own
huts
more
or
less
out
of
touch
with
the
commercial
world
throughout
the
world
the
tendency
has
been
of
late
to
lay
considerable
emphasis
on
distributive
and
industrial
based
on
a
system
of
village
industries
and
enterprise
herein
would
be
found
the
origins
of
the
arts
and
crafts
guilds
and
the
garden
cities
the
idea
underlying
all
these
being
to
inaugurate
a
reign
of
socialism
and
eradicating
the
entirely
unequal
distribution
of
wealth
amongst
producers
and
consumers
india
has
always
been
a
country
of
small
tenantry
and
has
thereby
escaped
many
of
the
evils
the
western
nations
have
experienced
owing
to
the
concentration
of
wealth
in
a
few
hands
the
communistic
sense
in
our
midst
and
the
fundamental
tenets
of
our
family
life
have
checked
such
concentration
of
capital
this
has
been
the
cause
for
the
of
factory
industries
on
a
large
scale
the
need
for
these
changes
to
which
england
is
returning
after
full
experience
of
the
miseries
of
life
in
manufacturing
towns
is
pressing

up

as

your

according
to
estimates
only
a
little
more
than
per
head
your
imports
per
head
are
about
ours
about
per
head
the
total
deposits
in
your
postal
savings
bank
amount
to
million
sterling
and
you
have
in
addition
in
the
trustees
savings
banks
about
million
sterling
our
postal
savings
bank
deposits
with
a
population
seven
times
as
large
as
yours
are
only
about
million
sterling
and
even
of
this
a
little
over
is
held
by
europeans
your
total
capital
of
companies
is
about
million
sterling
ours
is
not
quite
million
sterling
and
the
greater
part
of
this
again
is
european
of
our
people
are
dependent
upon
agriculture
and
agriculture
has
been
for
some
time
steadily
deteriorating
indian
agriculturists
are
too
poor
and
are
moreover
too
heavily
indebted
to
be
able
to
apply
any
capital
to
land
and
the
result
is
that
over
the
greater
part
of
india
agriculture
is
as
sir
james
caird
pointed
out
more
than
years
ago
only
a
process
of
exhaustion
of
the
soil
the
yield
per
acre
is
steadily
diminishing
being
now
only
about
to
bushels
an
acre
against
about
bushels
here
in
england
in
all
the
matters
which
come
under
gokhale
first
test
the
bureaucracy
has
been
and
is
inefficient
give
indians
a
chance
all
we
say
in
the
matter
is
you
have
not
succeeded
in
bringing
education
health
prosperity
to
the
masses
of
the
people
is
it
not
time
to
give
indians
a
chance
of
doing
for
their
own
country
work
similar
to
that
which
japan
and
other
nations
have
done
for
theirs
surely
the
claim
is
not
unreasonable
if
the
say
that
the
masses
are
their
peculiar
care
and
that
the
educated
classes
care
not
for
them
but
only
for
place
and
power
then
we
point
to
the
congress
to
the
speeches
and
the
resolutions
eloquent
of
their
love
and
their
knowledge
it
is
not
their
fault
that
they
gaze
on
their
poverty
in
helpless
despair
or
let
justice
rahim
answer
as
for
the
representation
of
the
interests
of
the
many
scores
of
millions
in
india
if
the
claim
be
that
they
are
better
represented
by
european
officials
than
by
educated
indian
officials
or
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
how
such
reckless
claim
has
come
to
be
urged
the
inability
of
english
officials
to
master
the
spoken
language
of
india
and
their
habits
of
life
and
modes
of
thought
so
completely
divide
them
from
the
general
population
that
only
an
extremely
limited
few
possessed
with
extraordinary
powers
of
insight
have
ever
been
able
to
surmount
the
barriers
with
the
educated
indians
on
the
other
hand
this
knowledge
is
instinctive
and
the
view
of
religion
and
custom
so
strong
in
the
east
make
their
knowledge
and
sympathy
more
real
than
is
to
be
seen
in
countries
dominated
by
materialistic
conceptions
and
it
must
be
remembered
that
it
is
not
lack
of
ability
which
has
brought
about
bureaucratic
inefficiency
for
british
traders
and
producers
have
done
uncommonly
well
for
themselves
in
india
but
a
bureaucracy
does
not
trouble
itself
about
matters
of
this
kind
the
russian
bureaucracy
did
not
concern
itself
with
the
happiness
of
the
russian
masses
but
with
their
obedience
and
their
paying
of
taxes
bureaucracies
are
the
same
everywhere
and
therefore
it
is
the
system
we
wage
war
upon
not
the
men
we
do
not
want
to
substitute
indian
bureaucrats
for
british
bureaucrats
we
want
to
abolish
bureaucracy
government
by
civil
servants
the
other
tests
applied
i
need
not
delay
over
the
second
third
and
fourth
tests
for
the
answers
aux
second
test
local
under
lord
mayo
some
attempts
were
made
at
decentralisation
called
by
keene
home
rule
and
his
policy
was
followed
on
lines
as
well
by
lord
ripon
who
tried
to
infuse
into
what
keene
calls
the
germs
of
home
rule
the
breath
of
life
now
in
an
experimental
and
limited
measure
of
local
home
rule
is
to
be
tried
in
bengal
though
the
report
of
the
decentralisation
committee
was
published
in
we
have
not
yet
arrived
at
the
universal
election
of
chairmen
decidedly
inefficient
is
the
bureaucracy
under
test
third
test
voice
in
the
councils
the
part
played
by
indian
elected
members
in
the
legislative
council
madras
was
lately
described
by
a
member
as
a
farce
the
supreme
legislative
council
was
called
by
one
of
its
members
a
glorified
debating
society
a
table
of
resolutions
proposed
by
indian
elected
members
and
passed
or
lost
was
lately
drawn
up
and
justified
the
caustic
epithets
with
regard
to
the
reforms
the
bureaucracy
showed
great
efficiency
in
destroying
the
benefits
intended
by
the
parliamentary
statute
but
the
third
test
shows
that
in
giving
indians
a
fair
voice
in
the
councils
the
bureaucracy
was
inefficient
fourth
test
the
admission
of
indians
to
the
public
services
this
is
shown
by
the
report
of
the
commission
not
to
need
any
destructive
activity
on
the
part
of
the
bureaucracy
to
prove
their
unwillingness
to
pass
it
for
the
report
protects
them
in
their
privileged
position
we
may
add
to
gokhale
tests
one
more
which
will
be
triumphantly
passed
the
success
of
the
bureaucracy
in
increasing
the
cost
of
administration
the
estimates
for
the
revenue
of
the
coming
year
stand
at
sterling
the
expenditure
is
reckoned
at
sterling
the
cost
of
administration
stands
at
more
than
half
the
total
revenue
civil
departments
salaries
and
expenses
civil
miscellaneous
charges
military
services
the
reduction
of
the
abnormal
cost
of
government
in
india
is
of
the
most
pressing
nature
but
this
will
never
be
done
until
we
win
home
rule
it
will
be
seen
that
the
secondary
reasons
for
the
demand
for
home
rule
are
of
the
weightiest
nature
in
themselves
and
show
the
necessity
for
its
grant
if
india
is
to
escape
from
a
poverty
which
threatens
to
lead
to
national
bankruptcy
as
it
has
already
led
to
a
short
and
a
high
death
rate
to
widespread
disease
and
to
a
growing
exhaustion
of
the
soil
that
some
radical
change
must
be
brought
about
in
the
condition
of
our
masses
if
a
revolution
of
hunger
is
to
be
averted
is
patent
to
all
students
of
history
who
also
know
the
poverty
of
the
indian
masses
this
economic
condition
is
due
to
many
causes
of
which
the
inevitable
lack
of
understanding
by
an
alien
government
is
only
one
a
system
of
government
suitable
to
the
west
was
forced
on
the
east
destroying
its
own
democratic
and
communal
institutions
and
imposing
bureaucratic
methods
which
bewildered
and
deteriorated
a
people
to
whom
they
were
strange
and
repellent
the
result
is
not
a
matter
for
recrimination
but
for
change
an
inappropriate
system
forced
on
an
already
highly
civilised
people
was
bound
to
fail
it
has
been
rightly
said
that
the
poor
only
revolt
when
the
misery
they
are
enduring
is
greater
than
the
dangers
of
revolt
we
need
home
rule
to
stop
the
daily
suffering
of
our
millions
from
the
diminishing
yield
of
the
soil
and
the
decay
of
village
industries
