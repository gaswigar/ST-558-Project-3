wherever
have
you
taken
yourself
off
to
shouted
a
boyish
voice
as
its
owner
jumping
an
obstructing
gooseberry
bush
tore
around
the
corner
of
the
house
from
the
kitchen
garden

i
here
all
the

so
you
need

came
in
resigned
tones
from
under
the
shade
of
a
large
fuchsia
you
enough
to
wake
the
dead
chumps
what
is
it
you
want
now
it

hot
to
go
a
walk
till
after
tea
i
trying
to
get
ten
minutes
peace
and
quiet
hereward

chumps
put
his

together
in
the
second
position
flung
out
his
arms
in
what
was
intended
to
be
a
graceful
attitude
and
made
a
mock
bow
worthy
of
the
cinema

them
by
all
means

he
replied
in
mincing
accents
your
humble
servant
has
no
wish
to
disturb
your
ladyship
elegant
repose
he
offers
a
thousand
apologies
for
his
unceremonious
entrance
into
your
august
presence
and
implores
you
to
condescend
stop
it
you
brute
hereward
burst
of
eloquence
was
brought
to
an
abrupt
end
by
the
violent
onslaught
of
a
puppy
which
flung
itself
upon
him
and
began
to
worry
his
ankles
with
delighted
yelps
of
appreciation

off

tell
you
i
be
chewed

protested
dodging
the
attacks
of
the
playful
but
all
too
sharp
teeth
and
catching
the
little
dog
by
the
piece
of
tarred

formed

throttled

ingred
extending
welcoming
arms
to
the
fat
specimen
of
puppyhood
and
rolling
him
about
on
her
knee
oh
he
make
you
dance
you
looked
so
funny
there
precious
do
chump
auntie
fingers
go
now
snuggle
down
on
auntie
dress
and
if
you
finished
talking
idiotic
nonsense
to
that
little
beast
interrupted
hereward
sarcastically
you
perhaps
kindly
oblige
me
by
mentioning
whether
you
coming
or
not
not
coming
anywhere
too
hot
grunted
ingred
resettling
her
cushion
under
the
fuchsia
bush
right
you
are

and
you
please
me
though
i
should
have
thought
the
run
to
chatcombe
ingred
sprang
to
her
feet
dropping
the
puppy
unceremoniously
you
do
mean
to
say
egbert
finished
mending
the
motor
bike
you
abominable
boy
why
could
you
tell
me
so
before
you
never
gave
me
the
chance
just
said
you
would
go
anywhere
yes
the
engine
running
like
a
daisy
and
the
sidecar
on
and
egbert
fussing
to
be
off
if
you
really
change
your
mind
and
want
to
go
but
by
this
time
ingred
was
round
the
corner
of
the
house
so
shaking
a
philosophic
head
at
the
ways
of
girls
in
general
her
brother
gathered
a
gooseberry
or
two
en
route
and
followed
her
in
the
direction
of
the
the
saxons
were
spending
their
summer
holidays
at
a
farm
near
the
seaside
and
for
the
first
time
in
four
long
years
the
whole
family
was
reunited
saxon
egbert
and
athelstane
had
only
just
been
demobilized
and
had
hardly
yet
settled
down
to
civilian
life
they
had
joined
the
rest
of
the
party
at
lynstones
before
returning
to
their
native
town
of
grovebury
the
six
weeks
by
the
sea
seemed
a
kind
of
oasis
between
the
anxious
period
of
the
war
that
was
past
and
gone
and
the
new
epoch
that
stretched
ahead
in
the
future
to
ingred
they
were
halcyon
days
to
have
her
father
and
brothers
safely
back
and
for
the
family
to
be
together
in
the
midst
of
such
beautiful
scenery
was
sufficient
for
utter
enjoyment
she
did
not
wish
her
mind
to
venture
outside
the
charmed
circle
of
the
holidays
beyond
when
she
thought
about
it
all
lay
a
nebulous
prospect
in
the
center
of
which
school
loomed
large
on
this
particular
hot
august
afternoon
ingred
welcomed
an
excursion
in
the
sidecar
she
had
not
felt
inclined
to
walk
down
the
white
path
under
the
blazing
sun
to
the
glaring
beach
but
it
was
another
matter
to
spin
along
the
high
road
till
as
the
fairy
tales
put
it
her
hair
whistled
in
the
wind
egbert
was
anxious
to
set
off
so
hereward
took
his
place
on
the
and
after
some
the
three
started
forth
it
was
a
glorious
run
over
moorland
country
with
glimpses
of
the
sea
on
the
one
hand
and
craggy
tors
on
the
other
and
round
them
billowy
masses
of
heather
broken
here
and
there
by
runnels
of
water
if
egbert
exceeded
the
he
certainly
had
the
excuse
of
a
clear
road
before
him
there
were
no
hedges
to
hide
advancing
cars
neither
was
there
any
possibility
of
whisking
round
a
corner
to
find
a
blocking
the
way
in
the
course
of
an
hour
they
had
covered
a
considerable
number
of
miles
and
found
themselves
whirling
down
the
tremendous
hill
that
led
to
the
seaside
town
of
chatcombe
arrived
in
the
main
street
they
left
the
motorcycle
at
a
garage
and
strolled
on
to
the
promenade
joining
the
crowd
of
who
were
sauntering
along
in
the
heat
or
sitting
on
the
benches
watching
the
children
digging
in
the
sand
below
much
to
ingred
astonishment
she
was
suddenly
hailed
by
her
name
and
turning
found
herself
greeted
with
enthusiasm
by
a
schoolfellow
ingred
what
a
surprise
avis
who
have
thought
of
seeing
you
are
you
staying
here
no
only
over
for
the
afternoon
we
rooms
at
beach

over
there
come
along
and
have
some
tea
with
us
and
your
brothers
too
yes
indeed
you
must
mother
will
be
delighted
to
see
you
all
i
sha
let
you
say
no
borne
away
by
her
hospitable
friend
ingred
presently
found
herself
sitting
on
a
seat
in
the
front
garden
of
a
tall
facing
the
sea
and
while
egbert
and
hereward
discussed
with
avis
father
the
two
girls
enjoyed
a
confidential
chat
together
only
a
few
days
now
sighed
avis
then
we
got
to
leave
all
this
and
go
home
how
long
are
you
staying
at
lynstones
ingred
a
fortnight
more
but
do
talk
of
going
home
i
want
the
holidays
to
last
forever
so
do
i
but
they
wo
school
begins
on
the
of
september
it
will
be
rather
sport
to
go
to
the
new
buildings
at
last
wo
it
by
the
by
now
the
war
over
and
we
all
got
our
own
again
i
suppose
you
going
back
to
rotherwood
are
you
i
suppose
so
when
it
ready
but
surely
the
red
cross
cleared
out
ages
ago
and
the
whole
place
has
been
done
up
i
saw
the
paperhangers
there
in
june
oh
yes
ingred
voice
was
a
little
strained
you
be
so
glad
to
be
living
there
again
continued
avis
i
always
envied
you
that
lovely
house
you
must
have
hated
lending
it
as
a
hospital
i
expect
when
you
back
you
be
giving
all
sorts
of
delightful
parties
wo
you
at
least
that
what
the
girls
at
school
were
saying
it
rather
early
to
make
plans
temporized
ingred
oh
of
course
but
jess
and
francie
said
you
a
gorgeous
floor
for
dancing
i
do
think
a
dance
is
about
the
best
fun
on
earth
the
next
time
i
get
an
invitation
i
going
as
a
quaker
maiden
in
a
gray
dress
and
the
duckiest
little
white
cap
do
you
think
it
would
suit
me
with
your
dark
hair
you
ought
to
be
something
eastern
i
can
just
imagine
you
acting
hostess
in
a
shimmery
sort
of
costume
promise
to
wear
all
right
laughed
ingred
it
so
delightful
that
the
war
over
and
we
can
begin
to
have
parties
again
like
we
used
to
do
beatrice
jackson
told
me
she
should
never
forget
that
carnival
dance
she
went
to
at
rotherwood
five
years
ago
and
all
the
lanterns
and
fairy
lamps
some
of
the
other
girls
talk
about
it
yet
hullo
that
the
gong
come
indoors
and
we
have
tea
ingred
was
very
quiet
as
she
went
back
in
the
sidecar
that
evening
though
hereward
sitting
on
the
was
in
high
spirits
and
fired
off
jokes
at
her
the
whole
time
the
fact
was
she
was
thinking
deeply
certain
problems
which
she
had
hitherto
cast
carelessly
away
now
obtruded
themselves
so
definitely
that
they
must
at
last
be
faced
the
process
albeit
necessary
was
not
altogether
a
pleasant
one
to
understand
ingred
perplexities
we
must
give
a
brief
account
of
the
fortunes
of
her
family
up
to
the
time
this
story
begins
saxon
was
an
architect
who
had
made
a
good
connection
in
the
town
of
grovebury
here
he
had
designed
and
built
for
himself
a
very
beautiful
house
and
had
liberally
entertained
his
own
and
his
children
friends
when
war
broke
out
he
had
been
amongst
the
first
to
volunteer
for
his
service
and
as
a
further
act
of
patriotism
he
and
his
wife
had
decided
to
offer
the
use
of
rotherwood
for
a
red
cross
hospital
the
three
boys
were
then
at
school
egbert
and
athelstane
at
winchester
and
hereward
at
a
preparatory
school
so
storing
the
furniture
saxon
moved
into
rooms
with
quenrede
and
ingred
who
were
attending
the
college
in
grovebury
as
day
boarders
for
the
whole
period
of
the
war
this
arrangement
had
continued
rotherwood
was
given
over
to
the
wounded
soldiers
and
saxon
herself
worked
as
one
of
their
most
devoted
nurses
in
course
of
time
egbert
and
athelstane
had
also
joined
the
army
and
with
three
of
her
menkind
at
the
front
their
mother
had
been
more
than
ever
glad
to
fill
up
at
the
hospital
the
hours
when
her
girls
were
absent
from
her
at
school
then
came
the
armistice
and
the
blessed
knowledge
that
though
not
yet
home
again
the
dear
ones
were
no
longer
in
danger
by
april
the
red
cross
had
finished
its
work
in
grovebury
the
remaining
patients
regretfully
departed
the
wards
were
dismantled
of
their
beds
and
rotherwood
was
handed
back
to
its
rightful
owners
naturally
it
needed
much
renovation
and
decorating
before
it
was
again
fit
for
a
private
residence
and
paperers
and
painters
had
been
busy
there
for
many
weeks
they
had
only
just
removed
the
ladders
by
the
middle
of
july
it
was
nearly
august
before
saxon
egbert
and
athelstane
were
finally
demobilized
and
they
had
gone
straight
to
lynstones
to
join
the
rest
of
the
family
at
the
farmhouse
rooms
what
was
to
happen
after
the
delirious
joy
of
the
holiday
was
over
ingred
did
not
know
she
had
several
times
mentioned
to
her
mother
the
prospect
of
their
return
to
rotherwood
but
saxon
had
always
evaded
the
subject
saying
wait
till
daddy
comes
back
and
the
welcoming
of
their
three
heroes
had
seemed
a
matter
of
such
paramount
importance
that
in
comparison
with
it
even
the
question
of
their
beloved
rotherwood
might
stand
aside
the
saxons
were
a
particularly
united
family
tremendously
proud
of
one
another
and
interested
in
each
other
doings
their
name
bespoke
their
old
english
origin
which
except
in
the
case
of
ingred
was
further
vouched
for
by
their
blue
eyes
fair
skins
and
flaxen
hair
egbert
and
athelstane
were
strapping
young
fellows
of
six
feet
and
hereward
was
taller
already
than
ingred
quenrede
immensely
proud
of
her
quaint
saxon
name
and
not
at
all
pleased
that
the
family
generally
shortened
it
to
queenie
had
just
left
school
and
had
turned
up
her
long
fair
pigtail
put
on
a
and
rather
condescending
manner
powdered
the
tip
of
her
classic
little
nose
and
was
extremely
particular
about
the
cut
of
her
skirts
and
the
fit
of
her
suÃ¨de
shoes
it
was
a
grievance
to
quenrede
that
as
she
expressed
it
she
had
missed
the
war
she
had
longed
to
go
out
to
france
and
drive
an
ambulance
or
to
whirl
over
english
roads
on
a
motorcycle
buying
up
hay
for
the
government
or
to
assist
in
training
horses
or
to
help
in
some
other
patriotic
job
of
an
equally
interesting
and
exciting
character
it
bad
that
just
when
i
old
enough
all
the
jolly
things
are
closed
to
women
she
groused
if
mother
had
only
let
me
leave
school
a
year
ago
i
at
least
have
had
three
months
fun
life
going
to
be
very
slow
now
there
nothing
sporty
to
do
at
all
ingred
the
youngest
but
one
and
fifteen
on
her
last
birthday
was
the
only
dark
member
of
the
fair
saxon
family
at
present
she
was
not
nearly
so
as
pretty
quenrede
her
mouth
was
a
trifle
heavy
and
her
cheeks
lacked
color
but
her
eyes
had
depths
that
were
not
seen
in
her
sister
and
her
thick
brown
hair
fell
far
below
her
waist
she
would
gladly
have
exchanged
it
for
the
locks
of
hereward
queenie
was
always
chosen
for
a
fairy
at
school
plays
she
grumbled
and
they
never
would
have
me
though
her
dresses
would
have
come
in
for
me
so
beautifully
i
do
see
why
some
fairies
should
have
dark
hair
and
it
was
just
as
bad
when
we
acted
merchant
of
miss
carter
gave
to
francie
hall
and
made
me
take
and
francie
was
a
perfect
stick
and
spoilt
the
whole
thing
next
time
i
declare
i
bargain
to
wear
a
golden
wig
and
see
what
happens
ingred
had
been
educated
at
grovebury
college
since
the
morning
when
a
fat
little
person
of
five
she
had
taken
her
place
in
the
kindergarten
she
and
quenrede
had
always
been
favorites
in
the
school
in
days
they
had
been
allowed
to
give
delightful
parties
at
rotherwood
to
their
and
though
that
had
not
been
possible
during
the
last
five
years
everybody
knew
that
their
beautiful
home
had
been
lent
to
the
red
cross
and
admired
their
patriotism
in
thus
giving
it
for
the
service
of
the
nation
from
avis
remarks
that
afternoon
it
was
evident
that
the
girls
at
the
college
expected
the
saxons
to
return
immediately
to
rotherwood
and
were
looking
forward
to
being
invited
to
entertainments
there
during
the
coming
autumn
and
winter
ingred
had
contrived
to
parry
her
friend
interested
questions
but
she
felt
the
time
had
come
when
she
must
be
prepared
to
give
some
definite
answer
to
those
who
inquired
about
their
future
plans
she
managed
to
catch
her
mother
alone
next
morning
for
a
quiet
chat
mumsie
dear
she
began
i
been
wanting
to
ask
you
this
are
we
going
back
to
rotherwood
after
the
holidays
saxon
folded
up
her
sewing
put
her
thimble
and
scissors
away
in
her
and
leaned
her
elbow
on
the
arm
of
the
garden
seat
as
if
prepared
for
conversation
and
i
been
wanting
to
talk
to
you
about
this
ingred
shall
you
be
very
disappointed
when
i
tell
you
oh
muvvie
ingred
tone
was
agonized
it
ca
be
helped
little
woman
it
ca
indeed
i
think
you
old
enough
now
to
understand
if
i
explain
you
know
this
war
has
hit
a
great
many
people
very
hard
there
has
been
a
sort
of
general
financial
some
have
made
large
fortunes
but
others
have
lost
them
we
come
in
the
latter
list
when
your
father
went
out
to
france
he
had
to
leave
his
profession
to
take
care
of
itself
and
other
architects
have
stepped
in
and
gained
the
commissions
that
used
to
come
to
his
office
it
may
take
him
a
long
while
to
pull
his
connection
together
again
and
the
time
of
waiting
will
be
one
of
much
anxiety
for
him
then
most
of
our
investments
which
used
to
pay
such
good
dividends
are
worth
hardly
anything
now
and
only
bring
us
in
a
pittance
compared
with
former
years
instead
of
being
rich
people
we
shall
have
to
be
very
careful
indeed
to
make
ends
meet
to
return
to
rotherwood
is
utterly
out
of
the
question
and
with
the
price
of
everything
doubled
and
trebled
and
our
income
in
the
inverse
ratio
it
is
impossible
to
keep
up
so
big
an
establishment
nowadays
where
are
we
going
to
live
then
asked
ingred
in
a
strangled
voice
at
the
bungalow
that
daddy
built
on
the
moors
fortunately
the
tenant
was
leaving
and
we
had
not
let
it
to
any
one
else
in
present
circumstances
it
will
suit
us
very
well
athelstane
is
to
be
entered
in
the
medical
school
at
birkshaw
he
can
ride
over
every
day
on
the
we
had
hoped
to
send
him
to
study
in
london
but
only
one
of
the
many
plans
that
have
agley
are
hereward
and
i
to
go
in
to
grovebury
every
day
hereward
can
manage
it
all
right
but
i
shall
arrange
for
you
to
be
a
weekly
boarder
at
the
new
hostel
you
can
come
home
from
friday
to
monday
now
do
cry
about
it
childie
as
a
big
tear
splashed
down
ingred
dress
after
all
we
much
to
be
thankful
for
if
we
had
lost
father
or
egbert
or
athelstane
out
in
france
we
might
indeed
grieve
so
long
as
we
have
each
other
we
got
the
best
thing
in
life
and
we
must
all
cling
together
as
a
family
and
help
one
another
on
cheer
up
it
will
be
simply
h
h
h
hateful
to
go
back
to
school
this
term
and
not
live
at
r
r
r
rotherwood
sobbed
ingred
her
mother
patted
the
dark
head
that
rested
against
her
knee
poor
little
woman
remember
it
just
as
hard
for
all
the
rest
of
us
we
each
got
a
burden
to
carry
at
present
suppose
we
see
who
can
be
pluckiest
over
it
we
fighting
fortune
now
instead
of
the
hun
and
we
must
show
her
a
brave
face
wo
you
march
with
the
family
regiment
and
keep
the
colors
flying
i
try
said
ingred
scrubbing
her
eyes
with
her
chapter
ii
opening
day
the
girls
college
at
grovebury
under
its
able
miss
burd
had
made
itself
quite
a
name
in
the
neighborhood
the
governors
realizing
that
it
was
outgrowing
its
old
premises
decided
to
erect
others
and
had
put
up
a
handsome
building
in
a
good
situation
near
the
abbey
no
sooner
was
the
last
tile
laid
on
the
roof
however
than
war
broke
out
and
the
new
school
was
immediately
commandeered
by
the
government
as
a
recruiting
office
and
it
had
been
kept
for
that
purpose
until
after
the
armistice
the
girls
considered
it
a
very
great
grievance
to
be
obliged
to
remain
cramped
so
long
in
their
old
college
the
foundation
stone
of
the
new
building
had
been
laid
by
queen
mary
herself
and
they
thought
the
government
might
have
fixed
upon
some
other
spot
in
which
to
conduct
business
instead
of
keeping
them
out
of
their
proper
quarters
all
things
come
to
an
end
however
even
the
circumlocution
and
delays
of
government
offices
and
by
the
beginning
of
the
autumn
term
the
removal
had
been
effected
and
the
ceremony
arranged
for
the
opening
of
the
new
college
naturally
it
was
to
be
a
great
day
the
members
of
parliament
for
grovebury
and
the
mayor
and
many
other
important
people
were
to
be
present
to
say
nothing
of
parents
and
visitors
the
pupils
assembled
in
the
freshly
greeted
one
another
excitedly
how
do
you
like
it
oh
it
topping
beats
the
old
place
hollow
there
room
to
turn
around
here
and
the
lockers
are
just
have
you
seen
the
not
yet
the
gym
utterly
perfect
and
so
is
the
lab
shame
we
had
to
wait
for
it
so
long
never
mind
we
got
into
it
at
last
among
the
numbers
of
girls
in
the
capacious
ingred
also
hung
up
her
hat
and
coat
and
passed
on
into
the
long
corridor
like
the
others
she
was
excited
interested
even
a
little
bewildered
at
the
unfamiliar
surroundings
it
seemed
extraordinary
not
to
know
her
way
about
and
she
seized
joyfully
upon
nora
clifford
who
by
virtue
of
ten
minutes
experience
could
act
cicerone
we
to
be
in
nora
assured
her
all
our
old
set
that
is
except
connie
lord
and
gladys
roper
and
meg
mason
i
just
met
miss
strong
and
she
told
me
she
moved
up
with
us
and
there
a
new
mistress
for
vb
have
seen
her
yet
but
they
say
she
nice
though
i
rather
stick
to
miss
strong
would
you
i
do
know
temporized
ingred
screwing
her
mouth
into
a
button
oh
of
course
i
forgot
you
not
a
enthusiast
never
were
now
like
her
it
easy
enough
to
like
anybody
who
favors
you
miss
strong
was
always
down
on
me
somehow
and
i
rather
have
tried
my
luck
with
a
fresh
teacher
i
wonder
if
miss
burd
would
put
me
in
vb
if
i
asked
her
of
course
she
would
do
be
a
silly
idiot
i
think
miss
absolutely
adorable
do
you
like
the
decorations
in
the
corridor
miss
godwin
and
some
of
the
school
of
art
students
did
them
but
just
wait
till
you
seen
the
here
we
are
now
then
what
say
to
this
the
big
room
into
which
nora
ushered
her
companion
was
lighted
from
the
top
and
the
walls
distempered
in
buff
had
been
decorated
with
stencils
of
egyptian
designs
the
bright
barbaric
colors
of
which
gave
a
very
striking
effect
there
was
a
platform
at
the
far
end
where
were
placed
rows
of
chairs
for
the
distinguished
visitors
and
also
pots
of
palms
and
ferns
and
geraniums
to
add
an
air
of
festivity
to
the
opening
ceremony
the
long
lines
of
benches
in
the
body
of
the
hall
were
already
beginning
to
fill
with
girls
their
bright
looking
almost
like
a
further
array
of
flowers
mistresses
here
and
there
were
ushering
them
to
their
places
the
kindergarten
children
to
the
front
seats
juniors
to
the
middle
and
seniors
to
the
rear
ingred
and
nora
motioned
by
miss
giles
to
a
bench
about
down
the
room
took
their
seats
and
talked
quietly
with
their
nearest
neighbors
a
general
buzz
of
conversation
constantly
restrained
by
mistresses
kept
rising
and
then
falling
again
to
subdued
whispers
in
a
short
time
the
hall
was
full
miss
perry
had
opened
the
piano
and
the
choir
leaders
had
ranged
themselves
round
her
in
dead
silence
all
the
girls
big
and
little
turned
their
eyes
towards
the
platform
the
door
behind
the
row
of
palms
and
ferns
was
opening
and
miss
burd
in
scholastic
cap
and
gown
was
ushering
in
the
mayor
the
mayoress
several
town
councilors
and
their
wives
a
few
clergy
the
of
the
school
of
art
and
to
the
place
of
honor
in
the
middle
sir
james
hilton
the
member
of
parliament
for
grovebury
who
was
to
conduct
the
ceremony
of
the
afternoon
he
was
a
pleasant
man
and
though
as
he
assured
his
audience
he
had
never
before
had
the
opportunity
of
addressing
a
room
full
of
girls
he
seemed
to
be
able
to
rise
to
the
occasion
and
made
quite
a
capital
speech
you
lucky
to
have
this
handsome
building
in
which
to
do
your
lessons
he
concluded
our
environment
makes
a
great
difference
to
us
and
i
think
it
is
far
easier
to
turn
out
good
work
in
the
midst
of
beautiful
surroundings
grovebury
college
has
reaped
a
reputation
in
the
past
and
i
trust
that
its
hitherto
excellent
standards
will
be
maintained
or
even
surpassed
in
the
future
as
member
for
the
town
there
a
special
word
i
wish
to
say
to
you
train
yourselves
to
be
good
women
citizens
some
day
when
you
grown
up
you
will
have
votes
and
in
that
way
assist
in
the
of
this
great
nation
the
better
educated
and
the
more
enlightened
you
are
the
better
fitted
you
will
be
for
your
civic
responsibility
every
girl
who
does
her
duty
at
school
is
helping
her
country
because
she
is
making
herself
efficient
to
serve
it
in
some
capacity
at
present
england
stands
at
a
great
crisis
if
we
are
to
keep
up
the
traditions
of
our
forefathers
we
want
workers
not
slackers
in
every
department
of
life
even
the
smallest
of
those
little
girls
sitting
in
the
front
row
can
do
her
bit
as
for
you
elder
girls
think
of
yourselves
as
a
cadet
corps
training
for
the
service
of
the
british
empire
and
let
every
lesson
you
learn
be
not
for
your
own
advantage
but
for
the
good
you
can
do
with
it
afterwards
to
the
world
i
have
very
great
pleasure
in
declaring
this
new
building
open
after
sir
james
had
sat
down
the
mayor
and
several
other
people
made
short
speeches
and
when
all
the
clapping
had
finally
subsided
the
piano
struck
up
and
the
school
sang
an
empire
song
and
the
national
anthem
then
the
door
at
the
back
of
the
platform
opened
again
for
the
exit
of
the
visitors
who
chatting
among
themselves
made
their
way
to
miss
burd
study
to
be
hospitably
entertained
with
tea
and
cakes
the
whole
ceremony
had
barely
occupied
an
hour
and
it
was
not
yet
four
the
girls
in
orderly
files
marched
from
the
and
betook
themselves
first
to
their
new
where
textbooks
were
given
out
with
preparation
for
the
next
day
and
desks
allotted
then
when
the
great
bell
rang
for
dismissal
to
the
playground
and
en
route
for
home
ingred
with
a
goodly
pile
of
fresh
literature
under
her
arm
walked
slowly
downstairs
she
was
not
in
any
hurry
to
leave
the
and
lingered
as
long
as
the
limits
of
miss
strong
patience
lasted
she
knew
there
was
a
certain
ordeal
to
be
faced
with
her
and
she
was
not
sure
whether
she
wanted
to
put
it
off
or
to
get
it
over
at
once
better
let
them
know
and
have
done
with
it
she
said
to
herself
after
a
few
moments
consideration
on
the
landing
after
all
it
my
business
not
theirs
it
was
a
rather
ingred
who
strolled
into
the
and
put
on
her
hat
francie
hall
trying
to
thread
her
boot
with
a
lace
that
had
lost
its
tag
looked
up
smiled
and
made
room
for
her
on
the
form
ingred
how
do
you
like
our
new
diggings
some
removal
this
is
it
i
must
say
the
place
looks
nice
it
topping
to
be
here
at
last
by
the
by
i
suppose
you
be
getting
in
rotherwood
soon
or
have
you
got
already
ingred
was
stooping
to
lace
her
shoe
so
perhaps
the
position
accounted
for
her
stifled
voice
we
not
going
back
there
not
going
back
francie
tone
was
one
of
genuine
amazement
why
but
you
said
it
was
being
done
up
for
you
and
you
be
moving
before
the
term
started
well
we
not
at
any
rate
what
a
disappointment
for
you
began
beatrice
jackson
tactlessly
as
several
other
girls
who
were
standing
near
turned
and
joined
the
group
you
always
said
you
were
just
longing
for
rotherwood
do
the
red
cross
want
it
again
queried
jess
howard
no
they
do
but
we
not
going
to
live
there
where
are
we
going
to
live
at
our
bungalow
on
the
moors
and
i
a
weekly
boarder
at
the
hostel
are
there
any
other
impertinent
questions
you
like
to
ask
do
all
speak
at
once
please
and
ingred
having
laced
both
shoes
got
up
seized
her
pile
of
books
and
turning
her
back
on
her
stalked
away
without
a
she
knew
she
had
been
rude
and
ungracious
but
she
felt
that
if
she
had
stopped
another
moment
the
tears
that
were
welling
into
her
eyes
would
have
overflowed
ingred
had
many
good
points
but
she
was
a
remarkably
proud
girl
she
could
not
bear
her
schoolfellows
to
think
she
had
come
down
in
the
world
she
had
thrown
out
so
many
hints
last
term
about
the
renewed
glories
of
rotherwood
that
it
was
certainly
humiliating
to
have
to
acknowledge
that
all
the
happy
expectations
had
come
to
nothing
on
the
reputation
of
rotherwood
both
she
and
quenrede
had
held
their
heads
high
in
the
school
she
wondered
if
her
position
would
be
the
same
now
that
everybody
knew
the
truth
as
a
matter
of
fact
most
of
the
girls
giggled
as
she
went
out
through
the
door
my
lady
in
a
temper
exclaimed
francie
lemons
and
vinegar
hinnied
jess
why
did
she
fly
out
like
that
asked
beatrice
well
really
beatrice
jackson
after
all
the
stupid
things
you
said
anybody
would
fly
out
i
should
think
commented
verity
richmond
sorry
for
ingred
i
heard
the
saxons
ca
go
back
to
their
old
house
it
hard
luck
on
them
after
lending
it
all
these
years
to
the
red
cross
but
are
they
going
back
why
silly
because
they
ca
keep
it
up
i
suppose
if
you
any
sense
you
wo
mention
rotherwood
to
ingred
again
it
evidently
a
sore
point
do
for
goodness
sake
go
rubbing
it
into
her
i
was
going
to
grumbled
beatrice
surely
i
can
make
an
innocent
remark
without
you
beginning
to
preach
to
me
like
this
i
call
it
cheek
verity
did
not
reply
she
had
had
too
many
squabbles
with
beatrice
in
the
past
to
want
to
begin
a
fresh
campaign
on
the
first
day
of
a
new
term
she
discreetly
pretended
not
to
hear
and
addressing
francie
hall
launched
into
an
account
of
her
doings
during
the
holidays
we
moving
out
to
repworth
at
the
september
quarter
she
concluded
and
it
too
far
for
me
to
bicycle
in
to
school
every
day
so
started
as
a
boarder
at
the
hostel
i
shall
go
home
for
though
nora
clifford
and
fil
trevor
are
there
too
they
be
glad
ingred
come
with
four
of
us
out
of
one
form
things
ought
to
be
rather
jinky
hullo
here
they
are
i
say
girls
let
go
to
our
diggings
the
two
girls
who
came
strolling
up
were
the
most
absolute
contrast
nora
was
plump
rosy
with
hair
a
lively
manner
and
any
amount
of
confidence
without
being
exactly
pretty
she
gave
a
general
impression
of
jolly
healthy
girlhood
and
reminded
one
of
an
cabbage
rose
that
had
just
burst
into
bloom
dainty
little
filomena
might
on
the
other
hand
be
described
as
the
most
delicate
of
tea
roses
she
was
fair
to
a
fault
a
maid
with
the
silkiest
of
flaxen
tresses
her
eyes
with
their
light
lashes
and
rather
colorless
little
face
with
its
straight
features
were
of
the
petite
fairy
type
you
felt
instinctively
that
like
a
dresden
china
vase
she
was
made
more
for
ornament
than
for
use
and
nobody
even
expected
too
much
from
her
experience
had
shown
them
that
they
did
not
get
it
for
two
years
ever
since
her
mother
death
fil
had
been
a
boarder
at
the
college
and
because
at
first
she
had
been
such
a
pathetic
little
figure
in
her
deep
mourning
the
girls
had
petted
her
and
had
continued
an
indulgent
attitude
long
after
the
black
dress
had
been
exchanged
for
colors
if
fil
had
rather
got
into
the
habit
of
posing
as
the
mascot
of
the
form
she
certainly
deserved
some
consideration
for
she
was
a
dear
little
thing
with
a
very
sweet
temper
and
never
made
any
of
the
remarks
that
some
of
the
other
girls
flung
about
like
missiles
she
was
so
manifestly
unfitted
to
take
her
own
part
that
somebody
else
invariably
took
it
for
her
verity
richmond
who
with
nora
filomena
and
ingred
represented
in
the
hostel
was
a
brisk
girl
full
of
fun
and
high
spirits
she
was
a
capital
mimic
and
had
a
turn
for
repartee
that
quite
laid
any
adversary
flat
in
the
dust
if
nora
and
fil
were
like
rose
and
lily
she
was
decidedly
the
robin
of
the
party
her
fair
complexion
seemed
to
add
force
to
the
brightness
of
her
twinkling
brown
eyes
and
her
general
restlessness
and
quick
alert
ways
made
one
think
of
a
bird
always
hopping
about
though
not
quite
such
a
romp
as
nora
she
was
ready
for
any
fun
that
was
going
and
intended
to
get
as
much
enjoyment
as
possible
out
of
the
coming
term
she
linked
herself
now
on
to
fil
disengaged
arm
taking
the
latter
pile
of
books
with
her
own
and
began
towing
her
two
friends
in
the
direction
of
the
hostel
i
hardly
had
time
even
for
a
squint
at
our
dormitory
yet
she
announced
best
said
i
was
late
and
made
me
pop
down
my
bag
and
fly
but
she
told
me
we
were
all
four
together
so
i
went
off
with
an
easy
mind
i
been
worrying
for
fear
i
be
boxed
up
with
some
kids
or
sandwiched
in
among
the
sixth
i
told
you
ingred
was
to
be
with
us
did
i
let
go
and
hunt
her
out
she
have
wiped
her
eyes
and
got
over
her
by
now
we
have
time
to
do
some
unpacking
before
tea
if
they
carried
up
our
boxes
the
hostel
was
a
separate
house
built
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
school
playground
it
could
accommodate
thirty
girls
and
were
already
entered
on
its
register
after
a
brief
peep
into
the
attractive
and
an
equally
the
three
girls
went
upstairs
to
a
dormitory
marked
they
found
ingred
already
at
work
on
her
task
of
unpacking
putting
clothes
away
in
drawers
and
spreading
the
shelf
that
served
as
a
with
an
assortment
of
photos
books
and
toilet
requisites
she
looked
rather
in
the
dumps
but
it
was
impossible
for
anybody
to
remain
gloomy
when
in
the
presence
of
such
lively
spirits
as
nora
and
verity
and
by
the
time
the
gong
sounded
for
tea
she
had
cheered
up
and
was
sitting
on
her
bed
discussing
school
news
illustration
let
call
ourselves
the
foursome
league
look
here
said
verity
if
we
want
to
have
a
jolly
term
we
four
must
stick
together
let
make
a
compact
that
both
in
school
and
in
the
hostel
we
support
each
other
through
thick
and
thin
we
be
a
sort
of
society
of
freemasons
i
have
made
up
any
secrets
yet
but
whoever
betrays
them
will
be
outlawed
let
call
ourselves
foursome
league
now
then
put
your
right
hands
all
together
on
mine
and
say
after
me
hereby
promise
and
vow
on
my
honor
as
a
gentlewoman
that
i
stand
by
my
chums
in
no
dormitory
at
any
cost
that
a
good
beginning
when
we
time
we
draw
up
the
rules
subscriptions
oh
bother
you
can
each
give
sixpence
if
you
like
and
we
spend
the
money
on
a
chocolate
feast
remember
fil
not
a
word
to
anybody
to
be
kept
absolutely
quiet
there
the
gong
if
the
tea
up
to
the
standard
of
the
rest
of
the
hostel
i
sha
object
glad
we
not
rationed
now
for
i
as
hungry
as
a
hunter
chapter
iii
though
the
college
only
opened
on
tuesday
afternoon
the
short
remainder
of
the
week
seemed
enormously
long
to
ingred
her
form
mates
were
the
same
but
everything
else
was
absolutely
changed
she
might
have
been
at
a
new
school
she
appreciated
the
convenient
arrangements
of
the
handsome
building
the
with
its
window
and
polished
floor
the
airy
the
studio
with
its
facilities
for
every
kind
of
art
work
the
three
the
laboratory
the
gymnasium
and
last
but
not
least
the
hostel
ingred
had
never
before
been
a
boarder
and
she
had
not
expected
to
like
the
experience
but
there
is
a
subtle
charm
in
community
life
that
infects
everybody
with
the
spirit
of
the
hive
and
in
spite
of
herself
she
began
to
be
interested
in
the
particular
set
of
faces
that
met
round
the
table
for
meals
the
greater
part
of
the
girls
were
in
the
middle
and
lower
school
but
there
were
a
few
members
of
the
sixth
who
sat
next
to
best
the
matron
and
nurse
warner
and
looked
with
superior
eyes
on
the
crowd
of
intermediates
and
juniors
to
have
secured
such
congenial
was
an
asset
for
which
she
could
not
be
sufficiently
thankful
whatever
troubles
might
await
her
downstairs
it
was
a
comfort
to
know
that
she
had
three
allies
ready
to
flock
to
her
support
she
had
not
known
any
of
them
well
in
the
past
but
as
they
seemed
prepared
to
offer
their
friendship
she
also
was
ready
to
act
the
part
of
chum
by
exchanging
desks
with
linda
slater
she
managed
to
secure
a
seat
next
to
verity
in
school
and
entered
into
an
arrangement
with
her
that
they
should
supply
the
missing
gaps
in
each
other
notes
for
miss
strong
often
lectured
so
rapidly
that
it
was
impossible
to
keep
up
with
her
i
wish
i
knew
shorthand
grumbled
ingred
comparing
scribbles
with
verity
as
the
girls
tidied
their
hair
for
tea
how
anybody
expected
to
get
down
all
miss
strong
tells
us
i
ca
imagine
it
impossible
i
do
try
admitted
fil
at
least
i
do
try
i
put
a
bit
here
and
there
but
i
write
so
slowly
i
only
through
before
bounced
on
to
something
else
and
i
missed
the
beginning
of
it
i
have
to
stop
too
sometimes
to
think
how
to
spell
the
words
the
others
laughed
for
fil
spelling
was
proverbial
in
the
form
and
was
often
of
a
purely
phonetic
character
miss
strong
had
periodical
crusades
to
improve
it
but
generally
gave
them
up
as
a
bad
job
and
recommended
constant
use
of
a
dictionary
instead
though
you
ca
go
about
the
world
with
a
dictionary
perpetually
under
your
arm
she
had
remarked
on
the
last
occasion
if
you
have
to
write
a
letter
in
a
hurry
and
you
begin
maddam
and
end
trueley
well
please
do
let
anybody
know
you
been
educated
here
that
all
or
it
will
be
a
poor
advertisement
for
the
college
ingred
was
not
at
all
delighted
to
be
still
in
miss
strong
form
she
only
moderately
liked
this
mistress
undoubtedly
miss
strong
was
a
clever
teacher
but
sarcasm
was
one
of
her
favorite
weapons
of
discipline
some
of
the
girls
did
not
mind
it
indeed
thought
it
rather
amusing
even
when
directed
against
themselves
and
enjoyed
it
hugely
when
someone
else
was
the
victim
of
the
sally
ingred
however
proud
and
sensitive
writhed
under
the
attacks
of
miss
strong
sharp
tongue
and
would
often
have
preferred
a
punishment
to
a
witticism
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
mistress
rarely
gave
punishments
and
was
proud
of
her
ability
to
control
her
form
without
resorting
to
them
she
was
short
in
stature
but
made
up
in
spirit
for
her
lack
of
inches
and
would
fix
her
dark
eyes
on
offenders
against
discipline
with
the
personal
magnetism
of
a
circus
trainer
or
a
schoolgirls
are
irreverent
beings
and
though
to
her
face
her
pupils
showed
her
all
respect
behind
her
back
they
spoke
of
her
familiarly
as
the
bantam
in
allusion
to
her
small
size
but
plucky
disposition
or
sometimes
in
reference
to
her
sarcastic
powers
as
the
sark
which
by
general
custom
became
the
snark
on
the
whole
miss
strong
pithy
racy
humorous
style
of
teaching
made
her
a
far
greater
favorite
than
mistresses
of
duller
caliber
she
had
a
remarkable
faculty
for
getting
work
out
of
the
most
unwilling
brains
her
form
always
made
excellent
progress
and
she
had
a
reputation
for
obtaining
record
successes
in
examinations
to
judge
from
the
first
few
days
of
term
she
meant
to
keep
up
her
standard
of
efficiency
miss
burd
had
mapped
out
a
heavy
for
and
it
was
miss
strong
business
to
see
that
the
girls
got
through
it
of
course
they
grumbled
after
the
long
weeks
of
the
summer
holidays
it
was
doubly
difficult
to
apply
their
minds
to
lessons
and
set
to
work
in
the
evenings
to
perform
the
enormous
amount
of
preparation
demanded
from
them
to
some
the
task
was
wellnigh
impossible
and
poor
fil
would
send
in
very
imperfect
exercises
but
others
ingred
and
verity
among
the
number
had
ambitions
and
boosted
up
the
record
of
the
form
it
was
after
a
most
strenuous
few
days
that
ingred
came
to
the
close
of
the
first
week
of
the
new
term
and
taking
her
books
and
started
off
to
spend
the
at
home
she
left
the
college
with
a
feeling
of
intense
relief
she
had
dreaded
the
return
there
and
the
confession
of
her
altered
circumstances
it
had
not
proved
quite
so
disagreeable
an
ordeal
as
she
had
anticipated
for
after
the
first
expressions
of
surprise
nobody
had
referred
again
to
rotherwood
yet
ingred
on
the
for
slights
imagined
that
she
was
not
treated
with
as
much
consideration
as
formerly
avis
marlowe
and
jess
howard
had
hardly
spoken
to
her
and
though
the
omission
was
probably
owing
to
sheer
lack
of
time
or
opportunity
she
chose
to
set
it
down
to
a
desire
to
show
her
the
cold
shoulder
now
i
have
no
parties
to
offer
them
they
do
care
about
me
she
thought
bitterly
they
hunt
about
till
they
find
somebody
else
likely
to
act
entertainer
fortunately
as
ingred
stepped
out
of
the
college
on
that
first
friday
afternoon
the
fresh
breeze
and
the
bright
september
sunshine
blew
away
the
cobwebs
and
sent
her
almost
dancing
down
the
street
she
had
a
naturally
buoyant
disposition
and
her
uppermost
thought
was
i
going
home
i
going
home
hurrah
the
journey
was
really
quite
a
little
business
she
had
to
take
a
tram
to
the
waterstoke
terminus
then
change
on
to
a
light
electric
railway
that
ran
along
the
roadside
for
seven
miles
to
grovebury
an
old
town
that
dated
back
to
mediÃ¦val
times
lay
in
a
deep
hollow
among
a
rampart
of
hills
so
that
in
whatever
direction
you
left
it
you
were
obliged
to
climb
the
scenery
was
very
beautiful
for
trees
edged
the
river
and
clothed
the
slopes
till
they
gave
way
to
the
gorse
and
heather
of
the
wild
moorlands
was
a
hamlet
which
since
the
opening
of
the
electric
railway
was
just
beginning
to
turn
into
a
suburb
of
grovebury
close
to
the
terminus
neat
villas
had
sprung
up
like
mushrooms
there
were
a
few
shops
and
a
branch
post
office
and
a
brass
plate
to
the
effect
that
whittaker
had
consulting
hours
twice
a
week
tradesmen
carts
drove
out
constantly
and
the
electric
railway
did
quite
a
little
business
in
the
conveyance
of
parcels
wynchcote
the
house
where
the
saxons
had
retired
to
try
their
scheme
of
retrenchment
lay
at
some
little
distance
beyond
the
terminus
and
might
be
considered
the
outpost
of
the
new
suburb
it
was
a
small
picturesque
modern
bungalow
saxon
had
built
it
as
an
architectural
experiment
intending
it
for
a
sort
of
model
country
cottage
the
tenants
who
had
occupied
it
during
the
period
of
the
war
had
just
returned
to
scotland
so
as
it
was
vacant
it
had
seemed
a
convenient
place
in
which
to
settle
it
was
near
enough
to
grovebury
to
allow
him
to
attend
his
office
and
far
enough
away
to
cut
them
adrift
from
old
associations
after
four
and
a
half
years
of
war
work
saxon
wanted
a
complete
rest
from
committees
crÃ¨ches
canteens
and
recreation
huts
and
would
be
glad
to
urge
the
excuse
of
distance
to
those
who
appealed
for
her
help
perhaps
also
she
felt
that
in
their
straitened
circumstances
it
was
wiser
to
live
where
they
could
not
enter
into
social
competition
with
their
former
acquaintances
i
just
want
to
be
quiet
to
attend
to
my
family
and
to
enjoy
the
moors
and
our
garden
she
declared
i
believe
i
going
to
be
very
happy
at
wynchcote
though
it
was
small
the
bungalow
was
admirably
planned
and
had
many
advantages
the
view
from
its
french
window
was
one
of
the
finest
in
the
district
and
it
faced
a
magnificent
gorge
wild
rocky
and
thickly
wooded
at
the
bottom
of
which
wound
the
silver
river
that
ran
through
grovebury
civilization
in
the
shape
of
fields
and
hedges
stretched
out
fingers
as
far
as
wynchcote
and
there
stopped
abruptly
past
the
bungalow
lay
the
open
wold
with
miles
of
heather
gorse
and
bracken
and
a
road
edged
with
low
grassy
banks
instead
of
walls
the
air
blew
freshly
up
here
and
was
far
more
bracing
and
healthy
than
down
in
the
hollow
of
grovebury
the
residents
of
the
new
suburb
affected
seaside
fashions
and
went
their
moorland
walks
without
hats
or
gloves
ingred
was
joined
in
the
by
hereward
who
attended
the
king
george
school
and
made
the
journey
daily
getting
quite
used
to
it
now
he
assured
his
sister
airily
i
had
a
terrific
run
yesterday
for
the
train
but
i
caught
it
another
fellow
in
our
form
living
up
here
so
we
generally
go
together
scampton
that
chap
in
the
cricket
cap
standing
by
the
door
he
he
wo
come
near
now
though
because
he
says
he
terrified
of
girls
he
going
to
give
me
a
rabbit
and
i
shall
make
a
hutch
for
it
out
of
one
of
those
see
i
bought
a
piece
of
for
the
door
there
heaps
of
room
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
i
believe
i
ask
him
to
bring
it
over
after
tea
but
the
hutch
is
ready
objected
ingred
oh
that
wo
matter
i
can
keep
it
in
a
for
a
day
or
two
when
ingred
and
hereward
reached
home
they
found
that
tea
had
been
set
out
on
the
patch
of
grass
under
the
apple
trees
and
mother
and
quenrede
were
sitting
sewing
and
waiting
for
them
it
was
one
of
those
beautiful
september
days
when
the
air
seems
almost
as
warm
as
in
august
and
with
the
clock
still
at
summer
time
the
sun
had
not
climbed
very
far
down
the
valley
the
garden
where
mother
and
quenrede
had
been
working
busily
all
the
afternoon
was
gay
with
nasturtiums
and
asters
and
overhead
hung
a
crop
of
the
rosiest
apples
ever
seen
minx
the
persian
cat
wandered
round
waving
a
stately
tail
and
mewing
plaintively
for
her
saucer
of
milk
derry
the
fox
terrier
barked
an
enthusiastic
greeting
come
along
you
poor
starving
wanderers
said
saxon
the
kettle
boiling
and
we
make
the
tea
in
half
a
moment
is
it
glorious
here
queenie
and
i
have
been
digging
up
potatoes
and
we
quite
enjoyed
it
we
felt
exactly
as
if
we
were
the
land
how
is
your
cold
hereward
ingred
you
look
tired
child
sit
down
and
rest
while
queenie
fetches
the
teapot
ingred
sank
into
a
with
much
satisfaction
wynchcote
might
not
be
rotherwood
but
it
looked
an
uncommonly
pretty
little
place
in
the
september
sunshine
to
live
there
would
be
like
a
perpetual
picnic
mother
and
queenie
looked
so
complacently
smiling
that
it
seemed
impossible
to
grouse
especially
with
scones
and
on
the
the
men
kind
of
the
family
had
not
yet
returned
home
saxon
and
egbert
rarely
left
their
office
before
six
and
athelstane
had
that
day
gone
over
to
birkshaw
on
the
to
arrange
about
the
medical
course
which
he
was
to
take
at
the
university
there
was
plenty
of
news
however
to
be
exchanged
ingred
had
to
give
a
full
account
of
her
experiences
at
school
and
hostel
and
to
hear
in
return
the
various
achievements
in
the
shape
of
mending
making
and
altering
which
are
always
an
essential
part
of
settling
into
a
new
establishment
i
hardly
feel
i
been
round
the
estate
properly
yet
she
said
when
tea
was
over
and
she
sat
leaning
back
lazily
in
her
with
minx
purring
upon
her
knee
then
come
and
lend
me
a
hand
with
my
suggested

down
that
wretched
pampered
beast
of
a
cat

goodness
sake

gets
at
my
new
rabbit

finish
it
yes

will
i
hang

or

along
you
brute
hereward
remarks
were
ignored
by
minx
who
finding
herself
dropped
from
ingred
lap
took
a
flying
run
up
his
back
and
settled
herself
on
his
shoulder
rubbing
her
head
into
his
neck
he
scratched
her
under
the
chin
swung
her
gently
down
and
shook
a
reproving
finger
at
her
do
try
to
come
round
me
with
your
blarneyings
you
siren
he
declared
who

my
goldfinch
yes
you
may
well
look
guilty
do
blink
your
eyes
at
me
like
that
i
have
forgiven
you
yet
and
i
do
think
i
ever
shall
ingred
old
sport
are
you
coming
to
help
me
or
are
you
not
i
want
some
one
to
hold
the
wire
all
right
uncle
podger
i
come
and
for
you
laughed
ingred
do
hammer
my
fingers
that
all
i
bargain
for
wait
a
moment
till
i
get
my
overall
your
joinering
performances
are
apt
to
be
somewhat
grubby
and
messy
there
was
quite
a
good
garden
at
the
back
of
the
bungalow
with
rows
of
vegetables
and
gooseberry
bushes
and
at
the
end
was
a
wooden
shed
where
the
was
kept
and
a
small
wired
enclosure
originally
made
for
hens
it
exactly
the
place
for
rabbits
when
i
get
a
hutch
for
them
explained
hereward
putting
down
his
box
of
tools
and
turning
over
the
with
a
professional
eye
now
a
wooden
frame
covered
with
wire
and
a
pair
of
hinges
will
just
do
the
job
i
can
saw
these
pieces
to
fit
hold
the
wood
steady
that
a
mascot
the
two
were
kneeling
on
the
ground
by
the
side
of
the
much
absorbed
in
the
process
of
exact
measurements
when
suddenly
there
was
a
rustling
and
a
scrambling
noise
and
on
the
wall
close
to
them
appeared
a
collie
dog
growling
snarling
and
showing
its
teeth
ingred
sprang
to
her
feet
in
alarm
wynchcote
was
so
retired
that
they
had
scarcely
realized
that
its
garden
adjoined
the
garden
of
another
house
the
collie
must
have
jumped
up
on
to
the
dividing
wall
and
being
an
beast
did
not
use
proper
discrimination
between
neighbors
and
tramps
shoo
get
away
urged
ingred
with
rather
shaking
knees
be
off
you
brute
shouted
hereward
the
dog
however
appeared
to
think
the
wall
was
his
own
special
property
and
that
it
was
his
business
to
drive
them
away
from
their
own
garden
it
continued
to
bark
and
snarl
now
as
hereward
wished
to
fix
the
in
exactly
the
spot
over
which
the
creature
had
mounted
guard
he
was
naturally
much
annoyed
and
sought
for
some
ready
means
of
dislodging
it
from
its
point
of
vantage
he
did
not
relish
the
prospect
of
being
bitten
so
did
not
want
to
engage
it
at
close
quarters
and
no
pole
or
other
weapon
lay
handy
looking
hastily
round
his
eye
fell
upon
the
with
which
athelstane
sometimes
cleaned
the
it
had
been
left
with
a
bucket
of
water
outside
the
shed
he
drew
out
the
piston
filled
the
syringe
then
discharged
its
contents
straight
at
the
dog
but
at
that
most
unlucky
moment
a
quick
change
took
place
on
the
wall
the
collie
retired
in
favor
of
his
master
and
the
stream
of
water
charged
full
into
the
astonished
countenance
of
a
precise
and
elderly
gentleman
from
next
door
for
a
few
moments
there
was
a
ghastly
silence
while
he
wiped
his
face
and
recovered
his
dignity
then
he
demanded
in
withering
tones
may
i
ask
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
ingred
and
hereward
overwhelmed
with
confusion
stuttered
out
apologies
and
explanations
the
old
gentleman
listened
with
his
busy
gray
eyebrows
knitted
and
his
mouth
pursed
into
a
thin
line
i
shall
immediately
take
steps
to
ensure
that
my
dog
has
no
further
opportunities
of
annoying
you
he
remarked
stiffly
and
took
his
departure
who
is
he
whispered
ingred
as
the
footsteps
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
shuffled
away
his
name
hardcastle
he
retired
and
lives
there
with
a
housekeeper
great
scot
i
put
my
foot
in
it
have
i
who
have
thought
he
was
just
going
to
pop
his
head
up
dad
was
going
to
ask
him
to
lend
us
his
but
it
no
use
now
i
expect
i
made
an
enemy
of
him
for
life
i
hope
he
means
to
keep
that
savage
dog
fastened
up
said
ingred
it
a
horrid
idea
to
think
that
it
may
any
time
pounce
over
the
wall
at
us
it
like
having
a
wolf
loose
in
the
garden
as
a
matter
of
fact
hardcastle
kept
his
word
in
a
way
that
the
saxons
least
anticipated
instead
of
chaining
the
dog
he
had
a
tall
wooden
paling
erected
along
the
top
of
the
wall
making
an
effectual
barrier
between
the
two
gardens
it
was
not
a
beautiful
object
and
it
cut
off
the
sunshine
from
a
whole
long
so
though
it
insured
privacy
it
might
be
regarded
as
a
doubtful
benefit
for
the
bungalow
it
makes
one
feel
so
suburban
mourned
quenrede
we
sha
be
visible
at
any
rate
when
we
digging
potatoes
laughed
saxon
and
that
a
great
point
to
me
for
i
past
the
age
that
looks
fascinating
in
an
overall
if
we
suburbia
on
one
side
of
us
we
the
open
moor
on
the
other
which
is
something
to
be
thankful
for
yes
until
it
sold
in
building
plots

bess
ingred
after
a
blissful
returned
to
grovebury
by
the
early
train
on
monday
morning
and
wrenching
her
mind
with
difficulty
from
the
interests
of
focused
it
on
school
affairs
instead
there
was
certainly
need
of
mental
concentration
if
she
meant
to
make
headway
in
the
college
the
standard
of
work
required
from
was
very
stiff
and
taxed
the
powers
of
even
the
brightest
girls
to
the
uttermost
miss
strong
reminds
me
of
rehoboam
wailed
fil
fresh
from
the
study
of
the
second
book
of
chronicles
her
little
finger
thicker
than
her
whole
body
used
to
be
and
instead
of
whips
she
chastises
us
with
scorpions
i
want
to
go
and
bow
the
knee
to
baal
rather
mixed
up
in
your
scripture
child
but
we
understand
your
meaning
laughed
verity
the
bantam
certainly
piling
it
on
nowadays
in
the
way
of
prep
shows
an
absolutely
brutal
lack
of
consideration
agreed
nora
so
do
all
the
mistresses
groaned
ingred
each
of
them
seems
to
think
we
nothing
to
do
but
her
own
particular
subject
linton
actually
asked
me
if
i
could
practise
two
hours
a
day
why
he
might
as
well
have
suggested
four
i
can
only
get
the
piano
for
an
hour
even
if
i
wanted
it
longer
it
a
frightful
business
at
the
hostel
to
cram
in
all
our
practicing
is
it
i
nearly
had
a
free
fight
with
janie
potter
yesterday
she
commandeered
the
piano
and
though
i
showed
her
the
music
with
my
name
down
for
to
she
would
budge
i
had
to
tilt
her
off
the
stool
in
the
end
it
was
like
a
game
of
musical
chairs
she
would
look
at
me
she
so
cross
about
it
not
that
care
in
the
least
music
was
a
favorite
subject
with
ingred
and
one
in
which
she
excelled
she
would
willingly
have
given
more
time
to
it
had
the
school
curriculum
allowed
she
was
a
good
reader
and
had
a
sympathetic
if
rather
spidery
touch
this
term
she
had
begun
lessons
with
linton
who
was
considered
the
best
master
in
grovebury
he
was
organist
at
the
abbey
church
and
was
not
only
a
doctor
of
music
but
a
composer
as
well
his
anthems
and
cantatas
were
widely
known
he
conducted
the
local
choral
society
and
trained
the
operatic
society
for
the
annual
performance
his
time
was
generally
very
full
so
he
did
not
profess
to
teach
juniors
it
was
only
after
celebrating
her
fifteenth
birthday
that
ingred
had
been
eligible
as
one
of
his
pupils
he
had
the
reputation
of
being
peppery
tempered
therefore
she
walked
into
the
room
to
take
her
first
lesson
with
her
heart
performing
a
sort
of
jazz
dance
under
her
jersey
linton
like
many
musicians
was
of
an
artistic
and
excitable
temperament
and
highly
eccentric
instead
of
sitting
by
the
side
of
his
new
pupil
he
paced
the
room
pursing
his
lips
in
and
out
and
drawing
his
fingers
through
his
long
lank
dark
hair
have
you
brought
a
piece
with
you
he
inquired
then
play
to
me
oh
never
mind
if
you
make
mistakes
that
not
the
point
i
want
to
know
how
you
can
talk
on
the
piano
what
have
you
got
in
that
folio
beethoven
rachmaninoff
we
try
the
beethoven
now
do
be
nervous
just
fire
away
as
if
you
were
practising
at
home
it
was
all
very
well
ingred
thought
for
linton
to
tell
her
not
to
be
nervous
but
it
was
a
considerable
ordeal
to
have
to
perform
a
test
piece
before
so
keen
a
critic
in
spite
of
her
most
valiant
efforts
her
hands
trembled
and
wrong
chords
crept
in
she
kept
bravely
at
it
however
and
managed
to
reach
the
end
of
the
first
movement
where
she
called
a
halt
it
not
talking
it
only
stuttering
and
stammering
on
the
piano
she
apologized
linton
laughed
her
remark
had
evidently
pleased
him
he
always
liked
a
pupil
who
fell
in
with
his
humor
you
the
elements
of
speech
in
you
though
you
still
in
the
stage
he
conceded
it
something
at
any
rate
to
find
there
material
to
work
upon
some
people
would
make
musicians
if
they
practised
for
a
hundred
years
we
got
to
alter
your
touch
your
technique
entirely
wrong
but
if
you
content
to
concentrate
on
that
we
soon
show
some
progress
you
have
to
stick
to
simple
studies
this
term
no
blazing
away
into
and
rachmaninoff
yet
awhile
i
do
anything
you
tell
me
agreed
ingred
humbly
linton
manner
might
be
brusque
but
he
seemed
prepared
to
take
an
interest
in
her
work
he
was
known
to
give
special
pains
to
those
whose
artistic
caliber
appealed
to
him
in
his
opinion
pupils
fell
under
two
headings
those
who
had
music
in
them
and
those
who
had
not
the
latter
though
he
might
drill
them
in
technique
would
never
make
really
satisfactory
pianists
the
former
by
dint
of
scolding
or
cajoling
according
to
his
mood
at
the
moment
might
derive
real
benefit
from
his
tuition
and
become
a
credit
to
him
it
was
a
in
the
school
that
his
favorites
had
the
stormiest
lessons
i
thankful
i
not
a
pet
pupil
declared
fil
whose
playing
was
hardly
of
a
classical
order
i
should
have
forty
fits
if
he
stalked
about
the
room
and
tore
his
hair
and
shouted
like
he
does
with
janie
he
scared
me
quite
enough
sitting
by
my
side
and
saying
we
take
this
again
now
with
a
sort
of
grim
politeness
as
if
he
were
making
an
effort
to
restrain
his
temper
i
know
i
not
what
he
calls
musical
but
i
ca
help
it
i
rather
hear
comic
opera
any
day
than
his
wretched
cantatas
and
when
i
not
practising
i
shall
play
what
i
like
there
and
fil
who
was
sitting
at
the
piano
twirled
round
on
the
stool
and
strummed
beautiful
k
k
katie
with
a
lack
of
technique
that
probably
would
have
brought
her
teacher
temper
up
to
point
had
he
been
there
to
listen
to
her
it
was
exactly
ten
days
after
the
term
had
begun
that
bess
haselford
came
to
the
college
she
walked
into
the
upper
fifth
form
room
one
monday
morning
looking
very
shy
and
lost
and
strange
and
stood
forlornly
not
knowing
where
to
sit
till
somebody
took
pity
on
her
and
pointed
to
a
vacant
desk
it
happened
to
be
on
a
line
with
ingred
and
the
latter
watched
her
settle
herself
she
looked
her
over
with
the
critical
air
that
is
generally
bestowed
on
new
girls
and
decided
that
she
was
particularly
pretty
bess
was
the
image
of
one
of
the
sir
joshua
reynolds
child
angels
in
the
national
gallery
the
likeness
was
so
great
that
her
mother
had
always
cut
and
curled
her
hair
in
exact
copy
of
the
picture
she
was
a
slim
rosy
smiling
specimen
of
girlhood
and
though
on
this
first
morning
she
was
manifestly
afflicted
with
shyness
she
had
the
appearance
of
one
whose
acquaintance
might
be
worth
making
ingred
decided
to
cultivate
it
at
the
earliest
opportunity
and
spoke
to
the
new
arrival
at
bess
replied
readily
to
the
usual
questions
we
only
come
lately
to
grovebury
we
used
to
live
at
birkshaw
yes
i
fairly
keen
on
hockey
though
i
like
tennis
better
have
you
asphalt
courts
here
and
do
you
play
in
the
winter
i
adore
dancing
but
i
hate
gym
i
learning
the
violin
and
i
to
start
this
term
she
seemed
such
a
pleasant
winsome
kind
of
girl
that
ingred
who
was
apt
to
take
sudden
fancies
constituted
herself
her
cicerone
and
showed
her
round
the
school
by
the
time
they
had
made
the
entire
tour
of
the
buildings
ingred
began
to
wonder
whether
without
offense
it
would
be
possible
to
leave
her
desk
next
to
verity
and
sit
beside
bess
there
was
a
great
charm
of
voice
and
manner
about
the
and
musical
ear
was
sensitive
to
gentle
voices
she
discussed
bess
with
the
others
next
morning
before
school
yes
she
pretty
and
that
blue
dress
is
simply
adorable
conceded
nora
i
going
to
have
an
embroidered
one
myself
next
time
her
hair
is
so
sweet
commented
francie
i
call
her
ripping
said
ingred
with
enthusiasm
well
you
ought
to
take
an
interest
in
her
ingred
considering
that
she
lives
at
rotherwood
put
in
beatrice
at
rotherwood
yes
did
you
know
ingred
under
pretence
of
distributing
turned
hastily
away
her
heart
was
in
a
sudden
turmoil
this
was
indeed
a
bolt
from
the
blue
she
of
course
knew
that
rotherwood
was
let
but
she
had
not
heard
the
name
of
the
tenants
and
as
the
subject
was
a
sore
one
had
forborne
to
ask
any
questions
at
home
it
was
surely
the
irony
of
fate
that
the
house
should
be
taken
by
people
who
had
a
daughter
of
her
own
age
and
that
this
daughter
should
come
to
the
college
and
actually
be
placed
in
the
same
form
as
herself
she
seemed
a
rival
biased
by
jealous
prejudice
ingred
judgment
reversed
itself
i
thankful
i
did
move
away
from
verity
to
sit
next
to
her
she
thought
i
expect
she
be
ever
so
conceited
and
give
herself
airs
and
the
other
girls
will
truckle
to
her
no
end
i
know
them
i
wish
to
goodness
she
had
come
to
the
college
why
did
they
send
her
away
to
a
boarding
school
i
not
going
to
make
a
fuss
over
her
so
she
need
think
it
poor
bess
quite
unaware
of
being
any
cause
of
offence
and
grateful
for
the
kindness
shown
her
the
day
before
greeted
ingred
in
most
friendly
fashion
and
looked
amazement
itself
at
the
cool
reception
of
her
advances
she
stared
for
a
moment
as
if
hardly
believing
the
evidence
of
her
eyes
and
ears
then
turned
away
with
a
hurt
look
on
her
pretty
sensitive
face
ingred
shut
her
desk
with
a
slam
she
was
feeling
very
uncomfortable
she
had
liked
bess
with
a
kind
of
and
if
the
latter
had
come
to
live
at
any
other
house
in
the
town
than
rotherwood
would
have
been
prepared
to
go
on
liking
her
generosity
whispered
that
her
conduct
was
unjust
but
at
this
particular
stage
of
ingred
evolution
she
did
not
always
listen
to
those
inner
voices
that
act
as
our
highest
guides
like
most
of
us
she
had
a
mixed
character
capable
of
many
good
things
but
with
certain
failings
rotherwood
was
what
the
girls
called
the
bee
in
her
bonnet
and
the
knowledge
that
bess
was
in
possession
of
the
beautiful
home
she
had
lost
was
sufficient
to
check
the
incipient
friendship
it
was
otherwise
with
the
rest
of
the
form
they
frankly
welcomed
the
and
if
they
did
not
as
ingred
had
bitterly
prognosticated
exactly
truckle
to
her
they
certainly
began
to
treat
her
as
a
favorite
she
was
asked
at
once
to
join
the
photographic
society
and
the
drawing
club
and
her
very
superior
camera
beautiful
and
other
equipments
were
immensely
admired
ingred
on
the
outside
of
the
enthusiastic
circle
preserved
a
stony
silence
her
own
camera
was
three
years
old
and
she
did
not
possess
materials
for
she
thought
it
quite
unnecessary
for
verity
to
want
to
look
at
bess
paraphernalia
verity
who
was
a
little
soul
perhaps
divined
the
cause
of
her
chum
glumness
for
she
came
presently
and
took
ingred
arm
i
something
to
tell
you
ingred
she
whispered
we
are
to
have
the
election
on
friday
afternoon
and
everybody
saying
you
be
chosen
warden
for
the
form
do
suppose
i
the
remotest
chance
grunted
ingred
gloomily
nonsense
do
be
a
in
my
opinion
you
just
have
an
easy
walk
over
with
the
removal
into
the
new
building
miss
burd
had
instituted
many
innovations
and
changes
among
the
most
important
of
these
was
the
college
council
which
really
served
as
a
sort
of
house
of
parliament
for
the
school
each
form
among
the
seniors
and
intermediates
was
to
elect
a
representative
called
a
warden
and
these
with
such
permanent
officers
as
the
prefects
and
the
games
captain
were
to
meet
once
a
fortnight
to
discuss
questions
of
it
was
a
new
experiment
and
the
head
mistress
hoped
it
would
give
the
girls
some
idea
of
responsibility
and
train
them
to
understand
civic
duties
later
on
the
girls
themselves
voted
it
a
ripping
idea
they
took
it
up
most
enthusiastically
it
would
be
fun
to
have
elections
and
it
seemed
desirable
that
there
should
be
a
warden
to
look
after
the
interests
of
each
separate
form
when
i
was
in
the
fourth
we
never
got
a
chance
for
the
tennis
courts
and
it
was
utterly
hopeless
to
appeal
to
the
prefects
said
ingred
i
always
used
to
feel
there
ought
to
be
some
way
of
making
one
voice
heard
well
if
you
elected
you
have
a
chance
to
make
your
maiden
speech
laughed
verity
by
the
bye
will
there
be
a
gallery
so
that
we
can
come
and
listen
to
you
i
be
sorry
to
miss
the
fun
friday
afternoon
had
been
fixed
for
the
election
and
a
bright
idea
originated
in
circulated
through
the
school
and
finally
crystallized
in
the
sixth
it
was
nothing
less
than
that
each
form
should
make
a
special
fÃªte
of
the
affair
lispeth
scott
the
head
girl
went
boldly
to
miss
burd
and
asked
permission
for
those
who
liked
to
bring
thermos
flasks
cups
and
bags
of
buns
and
cakes
and
hold
parties
in
the
various
it
would
make
so
much
more
of
the
whole
thing
she
urged
if
we
simply
stop
for
ten
minutes
after
school
and
vote
i
afraid
it
may
fall
rather
flat
but
if
every
form
has
its
festival
to
elect
its
own
warden
it
will
make
the
council
seem
a
much
more
important
business
we
like
to
be
allowed
to
stay
till
about
five
if
we
may
so
that
there
would
be
time
to
have
some
fun
over
it
we
promise
not
to
make
a
mess
with
our
picnicking
miss
burd
looking
rather
astonished
nevertheless
consented
she
was
a
wise
woman
and
believed
in
permitting
a
certain
amount
of
liberty
within
limits
you
may
try
it
this
once
she
conceded
but
it
on
the
distinct
understanding
that
you
all
on
your
good
behavior
i
shall
hold
you
prefects
responsible
for
controlling
the
school
if
you
hear
a
great
noise
you
must
go
into
their
and
stop
them
i
ca
allow
the
college
to
be
turned
into
a
we
wo
i
put
them
all
on
their
honor
to
behave
and
i
leave
the
door
of
our
open
so
that
i
can
hear
what
going
on
thank
you
so
much
miss
burd
and
lispeth
departed
fearful
lest
any
other
qualifications
should
be
added
to
temper
the
joy
of
the
proceedings
six
girls
waiting
outside
the
door
to
hear
the
result
of
the
negotiations
waved
signals
of
success
to
others
farther
down
the
corridor
and
in
an
almost
incredibly
short
space
of
time
the
happy
news
had
spread
to
the
remotest
corners
of
the
school
but
how
are
we
hostelites
going
to
manage
our
share
asked
ingred
anxiously
do
you
worry
about
that
jess
and
francie
assured
her
ten
girls
in
our
form
have
promised
to
bring
thermos
flasks
and
if
we
pool
to
tea
there
be
heaps
to
go
round
and
the
same
with
buns
and
cakes
each
bring
a
little
extra
to
make
enough
the
hostel
will
very
likely
lend
you
each
a
cup
if
you
ask
for
it
that
all
you
need
we
cast
ourselves
on
the
charity
of
the
form
agreed
ingred
chapter
v
the
fÃªte
by
a
general
indulgence
issued
from
the
dismissal
bell
rang
at
the
next
friday
afternoon
instead
of
as
usual
at
four
the
mistresses
entered
up
the
marks
put
away
their
books
said
good
afternoon
girls
and
made
their
exit
leaving
the
building
for
once
in
the
sole
possession
of
the
pupils
miss
strong
indeed
who
disapproved
of
the
whole
business
took
the
precaution
of
locking
her
desk
before
her
departure
a
proceeding
which
provoked
indignant
sniffs
from
the
witnesses
but
sublimely
indifferent
to
public
opinion
she
put
the
key
in
her
pocket
and
stalked
from
the
room
the
girls
gave
her
a
few
moments
grace
to
get
out
of
earshot
then
broke
into
a
babble
of
conversation
which
are
we
having
first
the
election
or
the
tea
oh
the
tea
no
no
business
first
and
pleasure
afterwards
i
ca
vote
till
i
had
some
tea
it
too
early
no
it
is
we
most
of
us
ready
for
it
look
here
suggested
ingred
let
settle
it
this
way
have
tea
first
then
the
election
and
then
some
fun
afterwards
do
you
think
that
would
sandwich
things
best
true
o
queen
i
do
mind
what
happens
afterwards
so
long
as
i
get
a
bun
quick
let
fetch
the
prog
agreed
linda
slater
leading
the
way
towards
the
where
the
baskets
had
been
stored
the
giggling
procession
met
emissaries
from
other
forms
bent
on
a
like
errand
and
exchanged
a
brisk
banter
as
they
passed
on
the
stairs
we
got
jam
tartlets
not
as
nice
as
our
cheese
cakes
nellie
brought
a
whole
pound
of
macaroons
oh
will
you
swap
with
us
for
rock
buns
i
should
just
think
not
dolly
arden
has
five
oranges
well
we
got
bananas
after
successfully
fetching
the
provisions
having
routed
a
marauding
band
of
juniors
who
were
poking
inquisitive
fingers
into
the
baskets
the
members
of
returned
to
the
closed
the
door
and
gave
themselves
up
to
festivity
the
four
girls
from
the
hostel
need
have
had
no
fear
of
scarcity
for
the
others
had
brought
ample
to
compensate
for
their
deficiency
by
general
consent
all
the
cakes
were
pooled
set
out
on
exercise
books
in
lieu
of
plates
and
handed
round
the
company
bess
whose
basket
contained
two
thermos
flasks
a
dozen
cheese
cakes
and
some
meringues
was
felt
to
have
brought
a
valuable
contribution
it
seemed
a
new
experience
to
be
sitting
at
their
desks
drinking
tea
and
eating
cakes
instead
of
doing
translation
or
writing
exercises
pity
the
snark
did
stop
she
does
know
what
she
missing
remarked
joanna
powers
as
she
took
a
meringue
oh
kafoozalum
we
should
have
had
much
fun
if
the
snark
had
stayed
do
bring
her
back
for
goodness
sake
jo
i
was
going
to
besides
which
she
probably
down
town
at
present
having
tea
in
a
cafÃ©
she
generally
does
on
fridays
she
wo
get
a
better
tea
than
we
having
i
undertake
she
wo
this
meringue
is
absolutely
topping
i
wonder
if
there
another
left
no
they
gone
every
one
of
them
hard
luck
though
the
hour
might
be
early
the
girls
appetites
were
quite
equal
to
the
task
of
finishing
the
various
delicacies
in
the
way
of
sweet
stuff
which
they
had
brought
with
them
cakes
disappeared
like
snow
in
summer
and
chocolate
boxes
passed
round
impartially
soon
returned
empty
to
their
owners
when
everything
seemed
almost
finished
bess
produced
another
hamper
which
she
had
carried
up
from
the
and
stowed
away
under
her
desk
she
handed
it
rather
shyly
to
beatrice
who
happened
to
be
her
nearest
neighbor
mother
sent
these
and
wants
you
all
to
share
them
she
remarked
beatrice
francie
and
linda
opened
the
hamper
all
three
together
then
with
a
delighted
of
satisfaction
drew
out
six
beautiful
bunches
of
purple
grapes
ingred
finishing
her
cup
of
tea
choked
and
coughed
she
knew
those
grapes
well
they
grew
in
the
vinery
at
rotherwood
and
had
been
the
pride
of
her
father
and
of
the
she
had
not
tasted
one
of
them
for
five
years
for
during
the
war
they
had
always
been
given
to
the
patients
in
the
red
cross
hospital
but
she
could
not
forget
their
delicious
flavor
why
had
her
father
let
the
vinery
with
the
house
the
grapes
ought
to
be
hers
to
give
away
not
this
girl
nobody
else
in
the
room
cared
in
the
least
where
the
fruit
came
from
so
long
as
it
was
there
appreciative
eyes
looked
on
in
glad
anticipation
while
beatrice
and
francie
divided
the
bunches
with
as
much
mathematical
accuracy
as
they
could
muster
at
the
moment
a
portion
was
laid
upon
each
desk
and
the
girls
fell
to
delicious
never
tasted
better
in
my
life
absolutely
topping
makes
one
want
to
go
and
live
in
a
vineyard
they
exactly
ripe
ingred
you
not
eating
yours
i
do
want
them
thanks
said
ingred
hurriedly
i
do
indeed
i
had
enough
pass
them
on
to
somebody
else
please
well
if
you
really
do
want
them
they
wo
go
i
dare
say
ingred
felt
as
if
the
grapes
would
choke
her
she
could
not
touch
one
of
them
she
hated
bess
for
having
brought
them
to
school
quite
irrespective
of
the
fact
that
she
would
have
done
exactly
the
same
in
her
place
had
she
been
fortunate
enough
to
have
the
opportunity
bess
looking
shy
and
anxious
to
evade
the
thanks
that
poured
in
upon
her
bundled
the
hamper
away
under
the
desk
again
and
made
a
palpable
effort
to
change
the
subject
what
about
this
election
she
asked
time
getting
on
it
after
four
good
night
have
we
been
all
that
time
feeding
here
girls
if
finished
let
get
to
business
said
avis
rapping
on
her
desk
as
a
signal
for
silence
and
constituting
herself
spokeswoman
for
the
occasion
you
know
what
we
met
here
for
to
choose
a
warden
to
represent
us
on
the
school
council
well
i
feel
we
could
do
better
than
send
up
ingred
saxon
she
look
after
our
interests
all
right
if
anybody
would
i
beg
to
propose
ingred
saxon
and
i
beg
to
second
that
called
nora
hands
up
those
in
favor
such
a
forest
of
arms
immediately
waved
in
the
air
that
though
in
strict
order
it
seemed
hardly
necessary
for
avis
to
call
out
those
against
no
opposition
hands
appeared
so
without
further
discussion
the
election
was
carried
congrats
ingred
said
nora
patting
the
heroine
on
the
back
i
told
you
it
would
be
a
walk
over
old
sport
whispered
verity
we
talked
it
over
beforehand
you
see
and
everybody
had
agreed
to
choose
you
so
it
was
really
only
a
matter
of
form
explained
francie
the
sixth
are
having
a
ballot
put
in
jess
and
vb
are
going
to
fight
like
kilkenny
cats
over
magsie
and
barbara
there
be
some
hullabaloo
in
several
of
the
forms
i
expect
thanks
awfully
for
electing
me
replied
ingred
i
suppose
i
ought
to
make
a
speech
but
i
really
do
know
what
to
say
you
got
to
say
it
all
the
same
laughed
verity
members
of
parliament
always
make
speeches
to
their
constituents
here
take
the
snark
desk
as
your
thingumgig
rostrum
or
whatever
it
called
and
begin
your
friends
romans
countrymen
lend
me
your
ears
squeaked
kitty
saunders
pushed
forward
by
a
dozen
hands
ingred
found
herself
occupying
the
mistress
place
and
facing
her
audience
made
a
valiant
attempt
at
oratory
with
cheeks
aglow
and
dark
eyes
shining
like
stars
she
looked
an
attractive
little
figure
and
a
bright
and
suitable
leader
for
the
form
i
ca
really
think
why
you
should
have
chosen
me
she
began
be
too
modest
yelled
a
voice
from
the
back
but
as
you
made
me
your
warden
i
take
care
that
all
our
grievances
are
very
well
aired
at
the
school
council
you
have
your
work
cut
out
interrupted
francie
of
course
i
know
it
wo
all
be
plain
sailing
and
that
the
sixth
need
a
great
deal
of
sticking
up
to
over
many
matters
that
so
came
from
the
front
desk
but
perhaps
be
prepared
to
talk
things
over
now
and
make
some
concessions
time
they
did
at
any
rate
i
shall
be
able
to
tell
them
what
you
all
think
flattering
for
them
and
to
make
things
as
smooth
as
possible
for
now
as
i
warden
may
i
propose
that
we
have
some
fun
before
we
go
shall
we
have
music
or
games
hands
up
for
an
emergency
concert
a
very
neat
way
of
getting
out
of
further
speechifying
said
verity
as
by
general
consent
the
concert
carried
the
day
but
you
shall
open
it
yourself
madam
warden
so
i
warn
you
you
not
going
to
be
let
off
do
you
think
it
silence
ladies
and
gentlemen
the
first
item
on
the
program
will
be
a
piano
solo
by
miss
ingred
saxon
the
celebrated
musical
star
brought
over
at
enormous
expense
on
purpose
for
this
occasion
you
blighter
murmured
ingred
as
the
prospective
audience
shouted
hear
hear
not
a
bit
of
it
purred
verity
i
guess
we
take
sparks
out
of
the
sixth
and
everybody
else
that
afternoon
was
certainly
in
a
position
to
boast
itself
it
was
the
only
form
in
possession
of
a
piano
for
by
the
sheerest
accident
it
had
one
the
instrument
was
only
a
temporary
visitor
placed
there
for
convenience
while
some
repairs
were
being
done
to
a
leaking
in
one
of
the
music
rooms
it
an
ill
wind
however
that
blows
nobody
good
and
it
gave
an
opportunity
that
was
denied
even
to
the
sixth
ingred
was
at
once
escorted
to
the
piano
and
officious
hands
piled
exercise
books
on
a
chair
to
make
her
seat
high
enough
i
ca
remember
anything
i
ca
indeed
she
protested
vigorously
now
do
twitter
nonsense
said
nora
i
heard
you
play
dozens
yes
of
things
without
music
at
the
hostel
so
just
got
to
try
i
shall
break
down
i
know
i
shall
then
you
can
begin
again
at
the
beginning
fire
away
and
do
be
affected
commanded
nora
it
is
one
thing
to
play
a
piece
from
memory
when
you
have
the
room
to
yourself
and
quite
another
to
play
it
with
half
a
dozen
girls
hanging
over
the
piano
and
the
rest
of
the
audience
sitting
on
their
desks
ingred
wisely
did
not
venture
on
anything
too
classical
but
tried
a
bright
spanish
ballade
and
managed
to
get
successfully
to
the
end
of
it
without
any
breakdown
in
the
midst
of
the
clapping
that
followed
came
a
loud
at
the
door
which
immediately
opened
to
admit
much
to
the
astonishment
of
the
fifth
two
of
the
prefects
and
a
consignment
of
sixth
form
girls
whatever
have
we
been
and
gone
and
done
now
murmured
verity
is
music
taboo
asked
ingred
guiltily
slipping
away
from
the
piano
the
errand
of
the
prefects
however
was
evidently
one
of
conciliation
and
not
of
reproof
they
were
smiling
and
looking
amiability
itself
we
thought
as
you
got
a
piano
in
your
room
began
lilias
ashby
that
we
might
as
well
come
and
join
you
if
you
do
mind
janie
got
a
book
of
songs
with
her
oh
by
all
means
of
course
replied
politely
and
unanimously
we
just
having
a
sort
of
concert
you
know
sure
you
do
mind
not
a
bit
of
it
run
and
tell
janie
then
susie
and
ask
her
to
bring
the
others
an
invasion
from
the
sixth
was
indeed
an
unwonted
honor
which
probably
nothing
short
of
a
piano
would
have
accomplished
the
hostesses
somewhat
overwhelmed
seated
the
distinguished
guests
to
the
best
of
their
ability
in
the
rather
limited
accommodation
and
hospitably
passed
round
their
few
remaining
pieces
of
chocolate
we
leave
the
door
open
please
said
lispeth
because
i
promised
miss
burd
not
to
let
those
intermediates
get
too
outrageous
and
i
have
to
listen
out
for
them
janie
potter
with
her
book
of
songs
was
pushed
forward
and
began
to
entertain
the
company
with
popular
selections
of
the
day
to
which
they
chanted
the
choruses
she
had
a
good
clear
voice
and
the
audience
joined
with
enthusiasm
in
the
various
ditties
the
clapping
which
followed
was
continued
down
the
landing
and
through
the
open
door
peered
the
interested
faces
of
most
of
the
members
of
vb
who
had
come
to
share
the
fun
may
we
butt
in
they
asked
hopefully
not
a
square
inch
of
room
for
you
answered
lispeth
but
you
may
squat
in
the
corridor
outside
if
you
like
anybody
who
performs
can
join
the
show
but
that
all
i
tell
you
when
it
your
turn
next
now
then
turning
to
the
hostesses
who
else
can
do
anything
francie
hall
come
along
at
once
i
ca
i
ca
objected
francie
so
it
no
use
asking
me
it
is
indeed
i
tell
you
what
bess
haselford
plays
the
violin
and
what
more
she
got
it
with
her
for
i
saw
her
put
it
away
in
the
it
was
my
lesson
with
signor
chianti
this
afternoon
that
why
i
had
to
bring
it
said
bess
turning
red
go
and
fetch
it
francie
ordered
lispeth
you
know
where
it
is
francie
returned
in
a
short
time
and
handed
the
neat
leather
case
to
its
owner
bess
looking
flustered
and
nervous
drew
out
the
violin
and
began
to
tune
it
i
brought
your
music
too
said
francie
triumphantly
opening
a
folio
so
you
no
excuse
for
saying
you
ca
remember
anything
who
play
your
accompaniment
here
ingred
oh
somebody
else
would
do
it
far
better
protested
ingred
janie
i
no
reader
lilas
could
to
save
my
life
go
ahead
ingred
and
do
waste
time
said
lispeth
firmly
ingred
sat
down
to
the
piano
without
a
smile
her
schoolmates
took
her
unwillingness
for
modesty
but
in
her
heart
of
hearts
her
main
thought
was
why
should
help
this
new
girl
to
show
off
she
would
have
played
accompaniments
gladly
for
anybody
else
but
she
considered
that
bess
had
already
received
quite
enough
attention
in
one
afternoon
for
her
own
credit
however
she
must
do
her
best
so
she
concentrated
her
energies
on
the
prelude
when
the
first
strains
of
the
violin
joined
in
her
musical
ear
recognized
immediately
that
bess
playing
was
of
a
very
high
quality
the
tone
was
pure
the
notes
were
perfectly
in
tune
and
there
was
a
ringing
sweetness
a
crisp
power
of
expression
and
a
haunting
pathos
in
the
rendering
of
the
melody
that
showed
the
performer
to
be
capable
of
interpreting
the
composer
meaning
in
spite
of
her
disinclination
ingred
warmed
to
the
accompaniment
when
the
violin
seemed
to
be
bringing
out
laughter
and
tears
the
piano
must
do
its
part
and
not
merely
supply
a
succession
of
unimpassioned
chords
ingred
was
a
good
reader
for
a
girl
of
fifteen
but
she
surpassed
herself
on
this
occasion
and
seemed
to
accomplish
the
difficult
passages
almost
by
instinct
she
played
the
final
notes
very
softly
as
the
last
fairy
strains
of
the
melody
thrilled
slowly
away
there
was
a
second
of
silence
then
the
girls
inside
and
outside
the
room
clapped
their
loudest
it
was
capital
declared
lispeth
encouragingly
bess
we
shall
want
you
again
for
school
concerts
you
and
ingred
ought
to
practise
together
let
me
look
at
your
violin
i
wish
could
play
like
that
thanks
ever
so
much
murmured
bess
to
ingred
as
the
latter
got
up
from
the
piano
oh
it
all
right
replied
ingred
airily
moving
away
in
a
hurry
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
she
did
not
want
bess
to
take
up
no
doubt
well
meant
but
rather
embarrassing
suggestion
that
they
should
practise
together
and
was
quite
ready
with
an
excuse
if
it
should
be
proposed
it
the
turn
of
the
sixth
now
she
jodelled
vb
have
done
anything
yet
i
call
one
of
them
in
said
lispeth
stepping
out
to
the
landing
once
through
the
door
however
her
ears
were
assailed
by
such
an
absolute
din
proceeding
from
the
farther
end
of
the
corridor
that
she
dropped
her
character
of
impresario
for
the
duties
of
and
calling
two
of
her
fellow
prefects
went
to
investigate
the
cause
of
the
disturbance
she
returned
in
a
short
time
looking
flushed
and
flurried
it
those
wretched
kids
in
she
proclaimed
they
were
behaving
disgracefully
pelting
each
other
with
the
remains
of
their
buns
and
fencing
with
rulers
and
they
actually
had
the
cheek
to
tell
me
they
were
making
any
more
noise
than
we
were
with
our
singing
and
playing
i
sent
them
home
at
once
and
i
think
we
all
better
go
too
those
intermediates
always
overstep
the
line
if
they
an
atom
of
a
chance
i
told
them
what
i
thought
about
them
it
been
quite
a
ripping
concert
and
i
sorry
to
break
it
up
but
you
understand
do
you
rather
replied
the
others
as
they
began
their
exodus
into
the
corridor
chapter
vi
the
school
parliament
during
the
excitement
of
the
concert
ingred
had
hardly
time
to
realize
the
greatness
of
the
honor
thrust
upon
her
in
being
chosen
as
warden
to
represent
her
form
all
it
stood
for
struck
her
afterwards
my
word
you
have
to
sit
up
and
behave
yourself
after
this
madame
remarked
quenrede
when
she
mentioned
the
matter
at
home
yes
of
course
they
all
look
to
you
now
as
an
example
added
mother
oh
i
do
think
they
will
declared
ingred
who
had
not
considered
her
new
office
from
that
point
of
view
i
just
to
speak
up
for
the
interests
of
the
form
you
know
there
are
obligations
as
well
as
interests
said
mother
seriously
try
to
make
a
useful
factor
in
the
school
that
would
be
something
worth
doing
would
it
in
arranging
for
the
school
parliament
miss
burd
had
allowed
wardens
to
be
chosen
by
each
form
from
iiib
upwards
but
had
decided
that
the
smaller
girls
were
too
young
to
take
part
in
public
affairs
every
form
that
sent
a
representative
constituted
itself
into
a
kind
of
club
and
chose
a
special
name
these
were
placed
on
the
council
register
as
follows
vi
the
true
blues
va
the
pioneers
vb
the
amazons
iva
the
old
brigade
ivb
the
mermaids
iiia
the
dragonflies
iiib
the
cuckoos
you
can
compare
marks
every
fortnight
said
miss
burd
and
whichever
gets
the
best
average
shall
hold
a
cup
that
i
intend
to
present
the
marks
of
the
whole
form
will
count
so
that
slackers
will
be
a
distinct
drawback
to
their
own
companies
any
girl
who
loses
a
mark
hinders
her
form
from
gaining
the
cup
and
of
course
vice
versa
those
who
work
will
help
the
question
of
marks
had
been
a
much
debated
subject
with
miss
burd
she
had
discussed
it
in
detail
at
several
educational
conferences
and
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
on
the
whole
the
system
was
highly
desirable
it
all
very
well
to
talk
about
the
evils
of
emulation
and
work
for
work
sake
she
confided
to
miss
strong
but
you
ca
get
children
to
see
things
altogether
in
the
same
light
as
i
own
that
when
i
was
a
child
myself
i
made
tremendous
efforts
so
that
i
might
be
head
of
my
form
and
when
the
arrangements
were
changed
at
our
school
and
instead
of
marks
and
places
we
only
had
first
second
or
third
class
i
slacked
off
considerably
i
knew
that
a
lesson
not
quite
so
perfectly
learnt
or
an
exercise
with
one
or
two
mistakes
would
still
find
me
in
the
first
class
so
why
should
i
make
such
enormous
exertions
when
every
slip
might
mean
the
loss
of
my
chance
to
be
top
i
was
far
more
careful
of
course
i
know
that
emulation
with
a
big
e
is
supposed
to
be
all
wrong
but
really
i
think
people
make
too
much
fuss
about
it
it
was
quite
friendly
rivalry
when
i
was
at
school
and
the
girls
with
whom
i
competed
were
my
dearest
chums
i
believe
my
new
system
here
is
going
to
unite
both
methods
every
girl
will
work
for
herself
but
her
marks
will
also
count
for
her
form
and
if
she
slacks
and
so
pulls
down
the
standard
i
hope
her
companions
will
give
her
as
bad
a
time
as
they
do
to
a
at
cricket
and
that
saying
something
the
idea
of
each
form
constituting
a
club
appealed
to
the
school
it
was
far
more
interesting
to
be
amazons
or
cuckoos
than
merely
vb
or
and
as
awards
were
to
be
according
to
averages
it
was
thrilling
to
feel
that
girls
of
twelve
could
wrest
away
the
silver
cup
from
the
hands
of
the
very
prefects
themselves
it
makes
it
just
like
playing
a
game
declared
ida
brooke
yes
a
sort
of
when
everybody
got
to
pull
and
must
let
go
added
cissie
barnes
do
you
remember
playing
and
once
with
the
sixth
all
held
on
to
each
others
waists
like
grim
death
and
janie
potter
gave
way
and
broke
their
chain
so
we
won
we
beat
them
again
too
i
like
to
see
that
cup
on
our
mantelpiece
the
pioneers
otherwise
were
as
anxious
as
any
of
the
other
forms
to
carry
off
laurels
even
fil
much
under
protest
really
made
quite
an
effort
to
work
you
ought
to
help
me
with
my
exercises
though
ingred
she
wheedled
remember
it
for
the
benefit
of
the
form
if
you
let
me
make
mistakes
well
it
the
form
that
will
suffer
you
ca
call
it
fault
it
on
your
own
head
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
i
simply
ca
spell
and
it
takes
me
hours
to
hunt
up
words
in
the
dictionary
i
looking
for
now
you
certainly
wo
find
it
in
the
f
laughed
ingred
what
an
infant
in
arms
you
are
here
then
go
ahead
and
i
act
as
dictionary
you
only
written
half
a
page
yet
you
be
a
week
of
sundays
at
this
rate
and
i
have
touched
my
latin
or
french
sighed
fil
dismally
i
wish
i
could
go
to
a
school
where
there
is
any
homework
and
that
somebody
would
invent
a
typewriter
that
would
just
spell
the
words
when
you
press
a
button
there
a
fortune
waiting
for
the
man
who
does
agreed
ingred
typewriter
spells
of
itself
it
would
sell
by
the
million
i
should
think
ingred
washed
her
hands
plaited
her
hair
and
put
on
her
best
brooch
and
her
new
bangle
to
attend
the
first
meeting
of
the
school
parliament
the
function
was
held
in
the
sixth
form
room
which
she
thought
slightly
unfair
for
the
prefects
being
on
their
own
ground
felt
a
distinct
advantage
and
acted
as
hostesses
there
were
four
of
them
so
with
the
games
captain
they
made
a
party
of
five
from
the
sixth
as
opposed
to
six
representatives
of
lower
forms
a
quite
undue
proportion
in
the
opinion
of
the
younger
girls
whatever
successes
the
intermediates
might
win
later
on
the
true
blues
had
carried
all
before
them
so
far
and
had
won
the
cup
by
an
average
at
least
a
dozen
marks
in
advance
of
the
mermaids
who
came
second
the
trophy
stood
on
their
mantelpiece
and
they
had
brought
an
ornamental
glazed
tile
on
which
to
place
it
as
if
they
meant
it
to
stay
there
on
the
whole
they
received
the
other
wardens
very
graciously
and
gave
them
opportunities
to
speak
and
air
their
views
questions
such
as
the
due
apportioning
of
the
asphalt
and
hockey
fixtures
and
various
school
societies
were
discussed
and
the
general
business
of
the
term
got
under
way
it
helps
things
to
be
able
to
talk
it
over
and
know
what
you
all
think
said
lispeth
we
making
so
many
changes
with
coming
into
the
new
building
that
it
almost
like
an
entirely
fresh
start
miss
burd
wants
us
to
get
up
a
sort
of
reconstruction
society
in
the
school
she
has
quite
planned
it
out
yet
but
she
told
me
a
little
about
it
and
i
think
it
ever
so
nice
as
soon
as
it
quite
fixed
up
i
going
to
call
a
general
meeting
and
explain
it
to
everybody
i
expect
that
will
be
next
wednesday
will
you
give
me
power
to
do
this
on
my
own
or
must
i
call
a
special
committee
on
monday
to
discuss
it
first
before
i
put
it
to
the
school
it
my
music
lesson
on
monday
i
could
come
demurred
ingred
and
i
have
to
go
to
the
dentist
immediately
after
four
chimed
in
alys
horner
the
warden
of
the
amazons
if
miss
burd
has
arranged
it
i
suppose
it
all
serene
said
mabel
hughes
of
the
old
brigade
you
like
it
i
know
i
explain
now
only
i
have
got
any
of
the
papers
and
besides
it
would
take
such
a
long
time
and
it
rather
late
and
i
want
to
be
getting
home
anyway
i
hope
we
shall
all
take
it
up
hot
and
strong
be
sure
to
keep
wednesday
free
though
i
going
to
ask
miss
burd
to
let
us
have
the
meeting
in
school
hours
if
possible
then
we
absolutely
sure
of
everybody
right
you
are
agreed
the
wardens
separating
in
a
rather
unparliamentary
fashion
to
admire
a
vinaigrette
scented
with
heliotrope
which
althea
took
from
her
pocket
and
handed
round
for
appreciative
sniffs
all
the
girls
felt
that
lispeth
scott
was
to
be
trusted
she
was
a
worthy
leader
for
the
new
order
of
things
she
was
a
tall
stout
fair
girl
of
almost
eighteen
and
rather
for
her
age
she
was
the
youngest
member
of
a
large
family
who
had
made
enormous
exertions
during
the
war
and
with
sisters
who
had
nursed
in
serbia
driven
in
france
served
in
canteens
in
huts
and
worked
at
munitions
she
had
excellent
examples
of
what
it
is
possible
to
do
for
one
country
she
was
a
decided
favorite
in
the
college
being
athletic
as
well
as
clever
and
of
a
very
jolly
merry
temperament
with
a
vein
of
great
earnestness
though
the
girls
sometimes
called
her
jumbo
they
meant
the
nickname
in
token
of
friendship
and
submitted
to
her
dictatorship
far
more
readily
than
they
would
have
done
to
that
of
any
other
member
of
the
sixth
who
had
been
put
in
her
place
miss
burd
had
great
confidence
in
lispeth
and
consequently
when
they
had
talked
over
the
matter
of
the
new
society
which
she
wished
to
be
formed
in
the
school
she
decided
to
leave
its
institution
entirely
in
the
hands
of
her
head
girl
it
will
be
far
better
for
the
mistresses
not
to
be
present
at
the
meeting
she
said
i
can
trust
you
lispeth
to
explain
things
and
the
girls
will
like
it
much
more
if
it
seems
to
emanate
from
the
new
council
talk
to
them
in
your
own
way
and
they
understand
you
i
want
the
society
to
be
an
absolutely
voluntary
one
or
it
of
no
use
do
let
them
think
they
must
join
merely
to
please
i
rather
have
a
dozen
who
are
in
earnest
over
it
than
a
hundred
members
only
those
who
feel
enthusiastic
need
give
in
their
names
i
do
mind
if
it
begins
in
quite
a
humble
way
indeed
i
only
expect
a
small
membership
at
first
on
the
contrary
miss
burd
i
think
it
will
catch
on
replied
lispeth
in
consequence
of
this
conversation
the
head
prefect
pinned
a
paper
on
the
convening
a
general
meeting
of
all
girls
over
twelve
years
of
age
to
be
held
in
the
big
hall
on
wednesday
afternoon
at
sharp
the
last
lesson
of
the
day
having
been
remitted
by
orders
from
the
study
there
was
a
universal
feeling
that
something
important
was
on
foot
so
those
forms
that
were
eligible
trooped
in
a
body
to
the
hall
while
the
disappointed
juniors
tried
to
console
themselves
with
the
reflection
that
they
would
be
able
to
go
home
half
an
hour
earlier
than
their
elders
after
considerable
shuffling
about
places
were
taken
unwilling
to
waste
further
time
lispeth
mounted
the
platform
and
rang
the
bell
for
silence
are
we
all
here
well
i
ca
wait
for
anybody
else
those
who
come
in
late
will
have
to
hear
what
they
can
and
you
must
tell
them
the
rest
afterwards
oh
here
they
are
quietly
please
there
plenty
of
room
over
there
violet
will
you
shut
the
door
now
that
we
all
together
i
want
to
have
a
talk
with
you
you
know
i
what
may
be
called
minister
of
our
school
parliament
and
though
your
wardens
will
report
all
we
say
in
council
i
think
it
is
well
to
have
a
public
meeting
sometimes
this
term
everything
seems
to
have
made
a
fresh
start
in
new
buildings
and
we
have
new
rules
and
our
very
parliament
is
a
new
institution
you
all
in
new
forms
and
i
the
new
head
prefect
it
not
only
in
school
that
everything
different
but
in
the
outside
world
as
well
this
is
our
first
term
since
peace
was
signed
i
can
remember
our
first
term
after
war
was
declared
i
was
only
in
iiia
then
quite
a
youngster
hetty
hughes
who
was
the
head
girl
made
a
speech
and
told
us
what
we
ought
to
do
to
try
to
help
our
country
i
think
some
of
us
who
were
here
have
never
forgotten
that
we
nearly
hurrahed
the
roof
off
and
we
formed
a
knitting
club
and
a
parcel
society
on
the
spot
you
know
for
yourselves
how
we
worked
to
keep
those
up
well
the
empire
is
at
peace
but
our
country
needs
our
help
as
much
as
ever
or
even
more
it
making
a
fresh
start
and
we
want
the
new
world
to
be
a
better
place
than
the
old
hundreds
of
thousands
of
gallant
young
lives
have
been
gladly
given
to
establish
this
new
world
in
this
school
alone
we
know
to
our
cost
and
we
owe
it
to
our
heroic
dead
not
to
let
their
sacrifice
be
in
vain
we
want
a
better
and
purer
england
to
rise
up
and
make
a
clean
sweep
of
the
bad
things
that
disgraced
her
before
i
expect
you
say
that
for
politicians
and
not
for
us
schoolgirls
but
it
is
popular
opinion
is
a
mighty
thing
the
schoolgirls
of
are
the
women
of
and
the
women
of
a
country
have
an
enormous
amount
to
do
with
the
formation
of
public
opinion
more
nowadays
than
ever
before
and
their
influence
will
go
on
increasing
with
every
year
that
passes
if
each
of
us
tries
to
help
the
world
instead
of
hindering
it
think
what
an
asset
each
one
may
be
to
the
country
it
really
a
tremendous
honor
to
know
that
we
can
all
take
our
part
in
the
reconstruction
of
england
it
like
each
being
allowed
to
lay
a
brick
in
the
foundation
of
a
new
building
of
course
you
ask
me
and
how
are
we
going
to
help
that
just
what
i
want
to
talk
about
we
pride
ourselves
on
being
practical
at
the
college
some
of
us
thought
we
might
start
a
new
society
to
be
called
rainbow
league
it
a
sort
of
of
helpers
and
we
want
to
do
all
kinds
of
jolly
things
to
help
in
the
town
something
like
our
old
club
and
parcel
society
only
of
course
different
we
could
give
concerts
and
make
clothes
for
war
orphans
and
toys
for
the
hospitals
and
for
crippled
children
there
are
heaps
of
nice
things
like
that
you
just
love
doing
it
called
rainbow
league
because
a
rainbow
was
set
in
the
sky
after
the
flood
to
help
people
to
remember
and
we
want
in
our
small
way
not
to
let
the
great
war
be
forgotten
but
to
do
our
bit
to
help
with
the
future
of
the
race
i
not
any
great
hand
at
speaking
or
explaining
so
i
want
you
each
to
take
a
copy
of
the
rules
of
rainbow
league
and
to
read
them
quietly
over
at
home
then
any
girl
who
likes
to
join
can
put
her
name
down
all
the
sixth
want
to
become
members
and
i
hope
lots
of
others
will
too
that
all
i
have
to
say
i
afraid
i
rather
a
bungler
but
you
understand
everything
if
you
read
the
papers
i
going
to
give
them
out
now
lispeth
very
red
in
the
face
came
down
from
the
platform
and
aided
by
her
began
to
distribute
papers
right
and
left
to
the
girls
as
they
filed
from
the
benches
amongst
the
others
ingred
took
hers
and
put
it
in
her
pocket
she
did
not
care
to
discuss
it
with
the
crowd
so
retired
to
a
corner
of
the
hostel
garden
and
amid
a
shower
of
falling
autumn
leaves
opened
the
typewritten
sheet
and
read
as
follows
the
rainbow
league
a
society
for
schoolgirls
who
wish
to
help
in
the
great
work
of
reconstruction
after
the
war
what
the
league
holds
that
every
soul
is
of
infinite
and
equal
value
because
all
are
the
children
of
one
father
that
every
girl
must
do
her
best
to
help
all
other
girls
and
to
advance
the
sisterhood
of
women
that
woman
greatest
and
strongest
weapons
are
love
and
sweetness
that
by
conscious
radiation
of
unselfish
love
to
her
a
girl
may
undoubtedly
raise
the
moral
atmosphere
of
the
world
around
her
that
every
girl
however
young
can
help
this
glorious
old
country
and
that
joined
together
for
good
the
schoolgirls
of
a
nation
can
influence
the
of
a
race
that
good
can
always
triumph
over
evil
and
that
love
and
unselfishness
will
wipe
out
many
social
blots
and
put
beauty
in
their
place
as
the
rainbow
has
seven
prismatic
colors
these
may
stand
for
seven
talents
of
woman
violet
virtue
the
of
influence
indigo
industry
which
means
willing
service
blue
beauty
in
its
many
and
varied
forms
green
generosity
to
give
of
our
best
to
others
yellow
youth
to
offer
our
best
years
to
god
orange
order
which
includes
organization
red
radiation
the
love
force
going
out
to
others
fellowship
every
member
of
the
league
shall
pledge
herself
to
forward
its
objects
and
to
take
an
active
part
in
any
schemes
of
help
that
may
be
instituted
in
connection
with
it

the

motto

give
ingred
sat
for
a
moment
or
two
watching
the
petals
blow
from
the
last
roses
on
the
bush
that
hung
over
the
worn
stone
wall
the
old
abbey
lay
on
one
hand
the
buildings
of
the
new
school
on
the
other
they
seemed
the
very
personification
of
ancient
and
modern
the
world
ca
stand
still
she
thought
and
if
it
got
to
move
on
i
suppose
i
better
help
to
give
it
a
shove
in
the
right
direction
walking
into
the
hostel
she
met
nora
and
fil
walking
hullo
ingred
have
you
read
the
paper
about
the
rainbow
league
asked
fil
eagerly
i
think
it
ripping
nora
and
i
are
both
going
to
join
and
so
am
i
said
ingred
as
she
passed
by
them
and
went
upstairs
chapter
vii
hockey
ingred
signed
her
name
next
morning
as
a
member
of
the
rainbow
league
and
received
a
neat
notebook
with
a
japanese
design
of
purple
irises
stencilled
on
the
cover
though
the
new
society
was
supposed
to
be
run
entirely
by
the
girls
themselves
it
was
much
encouraged
at
and
special
allowances
were
made
for
its
activities
miss
burd
sent
for
a
book
on
at
and
gave
the
handicraft
classes
an
indulgence
to
concentrate
for
the
present
on
the
construction
of
little
windmills
carts
dolls
furniture
trains
jigsaw
puzzles
and
other
articles
described
in
its
fascinating
pages
such
a
number
of
girls
had
joined
the
league
that
many
willing
hands
were
at
work
and
at
christmas
they
hoped
to
have
a
sale
of
the
best
of
the
toys
in
aid
of
a
fund
for
war
orphans
and
to
send
the
remainder
to
be
given
away
as
treats
for
poor
children
lispeth
was
highly
enthusiastic
and
full
of
future
schemes
we
do
this
term
she
decreed
and
then
next
term
we
can
think
of
something
else
in
the
spring
and
summer
we
have
a
posy
union
to
send
bunches
of
flowers
to
sick
people
we
ca
do
anything
of
that
of
course
during
the
winter
unless
some
of
you
like
to
put
down
bulbs
it
would
be
lovely
to
give
a
pot
of
purple
crocuses
to
a
little
crippled
child
i
think
making
the
toys
is
just
i
want
to
start
a
manufactory
barring
the
glue
said
susie
wakefield
it
smells
simply
abominable
when
it
boils
over
why
does
somebody
bring
out
a
patent
for
glue
glue
you
sybarite
why
not
they
could
make
it
out
of
all
those
delicious
gums
and
resins
you
read
about
in
books
on
the
spice
islands
instead
of
by
the
by
what
is
glue
made
of
horses
hoofs
i
believe
but
i
fancy
it
better
not
to
ask
what
made
of
i
do
think
your
gums
and
resins
would
do
the
deed
so
well
we
best
stick
to
good
glue
that
just
what
i
complained
of
i
stick
to
it
or
rather
it
sticks
to
me
i
get
it
all
over
my
hands
and
smears
down
my
overall
then
you
an
untidy
workwoman
old
sport
and
i
ca
do
anything
for
you
except
recommend
the
girls
were
grateful
for
the
latitude
of
the
handicraft
class
for
otherwise
they
would
have
had
little
or
no
time
to
give
to
the
construction
of
toys
the
homework
of
the
college
was
stiff
and
certain
games
were
compulsory
the
hockey
season
had
begun
and
fixtures
had
been
made
with
other
schools
in
the
neighborhood
we
must
see
that
the
old
coll
keeps
up
its
reputation
said
blossom
webster
the
games
captain
last
year
when
we
had
lennie
peters
and
sophy
aston
we
did
a
thing
or
two
did
we
girl
has
done
girl
can
do
and
we
just
got
to
buck
up
and
try
rather
agreed
the
team
among
the
various
matches
which
had
been
arranged
was
one
with
the
clinton
high
school
old
girls
association
it
was
an
amateur
team
of
enthusiasts
who
debarred
from
playing
any
longer
for
their
school
had
established
a
club
of
their
own
they
had
sent
a
challenge
to
grovebury
college
and
it
had
been
accepted
saturday
morning
a
weird
time
for
a
match
said
blossom
the
letter
to
her
chums
but
their
captain
says
it
the
only
time
they
can
get
their
field
it
used
by
another
club
in
the
afternoons
so
she
fixed
eleven
it
suits
me
rather
decently
said
janie
potter
i
going
out
to
tea
in
the
afternoon
so
i
could
have
come
if
the
match
had
been
at
three
do
stare
at
me
like
that
i
a
slacker
i
must
accept
invitations
to
tea
sometimes
even
if
i
in
the
team
what
a
dragon
you
are
blossom
good
thing
some
one
keeps
the
team
up
or
you
be
gadding
off
instead
of
playing
returned
blossom
grimly
grovebury
expects
every
girl
to
do
her
duty
on
saturday
it
will
be
bad
luck
for
the
season
if
we
lose
our
first
match
the
clinton
old
girls
association
had
its
field
at
denscourt
a
town
ten
miles
away
from
grovebury
it
was
arranged
by
the
team
and
for
any
girls
from
the
college
who
cared
to
come
as
spectators
to
meet
at
the
railway
station
at
and
travel
together
under
the
escort
of
miss
giles
ingred
who
was
a
keen
player
and
very
proud
of
having
been
placed
in
the
reserve
was
to
spend
friday
night
at
the
hostel
instead
of
returning
as
usual
to
nora
verity
and
fil
were
also
to
be
numbered
among
the
spectators
on
the
eventful
morning
as
the
girls
were
just
finishing
breakfast
a
telegram
arrived
for
rachel
grant
she
tore
open
the
yellow
envelope
and
her
face
fell
as
she
read
the
brief
message
her
mother
was
seriously
ill
and
she
must
return
home
immediately
best
went
upstairs
at
once
to
arrange
for
her
hurried
journey
and
to
help
her
to
pack
downstairs
at
the
the
girls
discussed
the
bad
news
they
were
very
sorry
for
rachel
and
also
for
themselves
for
she
was
their
right
inner
it
like
our
luck
fretted
janie
potter
too
disgusting
for
words
groused
doreen
hayward
poor
old
rachel
groaned
fil
what
going
to
be
done
asked
everybody
as
they
folded
their
serviettes
and
left
the
table
that
question
was
answered
by
miss
giles
who
beckoned
to
ingred
in
the
hall
and
said
briefly
ingred
will
you
fetch
your
and
pads
ingred
did
not
need
telling
twice
to
take
rachel
place
was
indeed
an
honor
such
a
chance
did
not
come
often
with
huge
satisfaction
she
donned
her
neat
skirt
edged
with
its
orange
band
and
her
blouse
with
its
orange
collar
and
cuffs
you
lucker
sighed
nora
enviously
i
just
jolly
well
give
everything
i
have
to
be
in
the
match
it
not
much
sport
to
stand
by
and
cheer
oh
do
think
i
trying
to
get
out
of
coming
going
to
look
on
and
see
that
you
do
your
duty
if
you
not
playing
up
i
hiss
i
do
my
best
laughed
ingred
and
if
i
drop
down
for
sheer
lack
of
breath
i
shall
expect
you
and
verity
to
carry
me
home
there
right
you
are
it
a
bargain
though
you
be
a
jolly
heavy
burden
i
can
tell
you
the
team
miss
giles
and
about
twenty
girls
as
spectators
were
punctual
to
their
appointment
and
assembled
at
the
station
just
in
time
for
the
train
by
a
little
maneuvering
combined
with
good
fortune
they
secured
three
compartments
to
themselves
for
a
solitary
old
gentleman
whom
they
found
in
possession
of
a
corner
seat
bolted
in
alarm
at
such
an
invasion
of
schoolgirls
and
sought
sanctuary
in
a
smoking
carriage
some
generous
spirits
had
brought
chocolates
and
which
they
shared
round
and
nora
the
irrepressible
produced
from
her
pocket
a
with
which
she
proceeded
to
entertain
the
company
until
frantic
raps
from
the
next
compartment
made
her
aware
that
miss
giles
heard
and
disapproved
of
her
amateur
recital
naturally
the
talk
was
largely
about
hockey
and
the
chances
of
the
match
it
was
known
that
the
old
clintonians
were
a
strong
team
for
most
of
them
had
been
the
crack
players
of
their
school
to
beat
them
would
indeed
be
a
feather
in
the
cap
of
the
college
too
good
to
come
off
groaned
blossom
gloomily
nonsense
you
ca
tell
till
you
tried
make
up
your
mind
going
to
win
said
nora
indignantly
i
sha
speak
to
you
again
if
you
lose
this
match
i
only
one
out
of
eleven
please
well
i
do
care
one
who
makes
up
her
mind
to
fail
can
spoil
everything
and
so
just
buck
up
and
win
the
hockey
ground
was
not
very
far
from
the
station
at
denscourt
and
when
the
grovebury
contingent
arrived
they
found
the
old
clintonians
ready
and
waiting
for
them
the
eleven
ran
into
the
pavilion
and
took
off
the
long
coats
that
had
covered
their
gym
costumes
then
trooped
out
on
to
the
field
as
neat
and
looking
a
team
as
could
be
imagined
blossom
with
her
chums
janie
and
doreen
took
good
stock
of
their
opponents
they
a
strong
set
and
will
take
some
beating
said
janie
rather
agreed
blossom
you
may
be
sure
we
not
going
to
goal
just
when
we
please
they
look
topping
sports
commented
doreen
everything
was
now
in
perfect
order
the
teams
were
placed
and
the
umpire
blew
her
whistle
for
the
match
to
begin
as
the
account
of
such
a
contest
is
always
much
more
interesting
when
narrated
by
an
actual
spectator
and
as
nora
wrote
a
long
and
accurate
description
of
it
afterwards
to
a
cousin
at
school
in
london
i
will
insert
her
letter
and
allow
it
to
speak
for
itself
letter
is
an
account
of
a
real
match
written
by
a
real
grovebury
college
dear
i
simply
must
tell
you
about
the
hockey
match
we
played
last
saturday
the
team
played
the
clinton
high
school
old
girls
association
at
denscourt
our
girls
were
awfully
keen
to
meet
them
and
were
not
at
all
daunted
by
the
fact
that
they
were
exceptionally
strong
about
twenty
of
us
went
as
spectators
and
as
we
were
about
to
set
off
to
the
station
with
the
eleven
rachel
grant
the
left
inner
received
a
telegram
conveying
news
of
her
mother
serious
illness
to
our
great
misfortune
she
was
obliged
to
go
home
at
once
and
the
first
girl
on
the
reserve
ingred
saxon
had
to
fill
her
place
miss
giles
the
games
mistress
went
on
to
get
the
tickets
and
in
spite
of
some
delay
we
managed
to
meet
her
in
time
to
catch
the
train
it
is
ten
miles
from
here
to
denscourt
and
we
arrived
there
in
about
twenty
minutes
the
field
is
not
very
far
from
the
railway
station
the
team
girls
were
taken
to
the
pavilion
and
when
they
were
ready
the
captain
tossed
up
veronica
hall
the
opposing
captain
who
is
a
tall
strong
girl
and
a
fine
hockey
player
won
the
toss
and
chose
to
play
against
the
wind
for
the
first
half
at
exactly
eleven
the
center
forwards
blossom
and
veronica
began
the
there
were
three
dull
clashes
as
their
sticks
met
and
then
with
a
dexterous
stroke
blossom
passed
the
ball
to
her
right
inner
janie
potter
before
she
could
strike
the
wing
on
the
opposite
side
captured
the
ball
and
with
a
clean
drive
sent
it
spinning
down
the
field
it
was
soon
stopped
however
by
doreen
hayward
the
right
half
who
after
successfully
dribbling
it
past
the
enemy
inner
sent
it
hard
out
to
aline
west
the
school
right
wing
soon
aline
had
the
ball
up
the
field
but
suddenly
she
stumbled
and
fell
headlong
to
the
ground
before
she
could
rise
the
ball
had
been
sent
to
the
rival
center
forward
who
with
a
magnificent
hit
drove
it
nearly
into
the
there
it
was
splendidly
blocked
by
kitty
saunders
our
left
back
and
quickly
passed
to
evie
irving
the
left
wing
there
was
a
brief
though
fierce
struggle
for
possession
of
the
ball
between
the
two
wings
in
which
evie
was
victorious
she
neatly
avoided
the
clinton
right
half
but
the
ball
went
off
the
line
the
opposing
rolled
in
to
her
wing
as
she
thought
but
with
a
swift
movement
ingred
saxon
the
left
inner
reached
the
ball
first
and
taking
it
with
her
ran
up
the
field
like
lightning
the
inner
on
the
other
side
was
an
equally
fast
runner
but
ingred
easily
evaded
her
continued
efforts
to
get
the
ball
for
some
time
has
she
lost
the
ball
is
she
still
flying
on
the
ball
before
her
she
pass
the
rival
back
safely
were
the
questions
which
thronged
my
brain
nearly
paralyzed
with
excitement
not
able
to
dribble
the
ball
any
farther
and
being
attacked
by
a
girl
wearing
the
clinton
colors
ingred
hit
the
ball
out
to
her
wing
who
struck
in
to
center
again
the
left
back
on
the
opposing
side
stopped
it
just
as
it
entered
the
yelled
one
of
the
onlookers
unable
to
contain
herself
and
with
a
fine
stroke
the
back
sent
the
ball
flying
away
to
the
other
side
of
the
field
it
went
with
such
force
that
although
our
right
back
made
an
attempt
to
stop
it
it
raced
past
her
stick
and
over
the
outside
line
after
the
nearly
all
the
play
was
carried
on
practically
in
the
center
of
the
field
each
side
displayed
some
excellent
passing
but
when
the
whistle
blew
at
half
time
neither
had
scored
by
this
time
all
the
girls
were
hot
and
panting
except
the
and
were
ready
for
the
brief
rest
our
eleven
stood
in
a
group
together
sharing
the
lemons
which
the
clinton
girls
provided
and
discussing
the
events
of
the
last
exclaimed
blossom
our
captain
simply
must
win
this
match
we
shall
have
the
wind
against
us
the
next
half
but
we
are
not
going
to
let
things
end
in
a
victory
for
the
clintonians
or
in
a
draw
either
are
we
was
the
decided
answer
a
few
minutes
later
every
one
was
in
her
place
again
but
of
course
defending
the
other
goal
blossom
and
veronica
were
once
more
this
time
the
latter
was
the
quicker
of
the
two
for
with
a
clever
hit
she
succeeded
in
sending
the
ball
away
to
her
left
wing
the
clinton
left
wing
began
to
dribble
it
along
towards
the
goal
we
were
defending
and
when
confronted
by
our
right
half
passed
it
to
her
center
i
almost
screamed
out
to
our
center
forward
not
to
let
veronica
keep
the
ball
for
i
knew
she
was
a
dangerous
opponent
she
was
well
up
the
field
and
with
a
neat
turn
of
her
stick
sent
the
ball
past
our
right
back
there
was
only
one
girl
now
to
prevent
her
from
getting
a
goal
blossom
was
now
fast
gaining
and
then
just
as
veronica
came
within
shooting
distance
her
foot
slipped
in
the
slimy
mud
and
she
lost
her
balance
blossom
was
level
with
veronica
by
this
time
and
before
the
clinton
captain
could
steady
herself
she
had
sent
the
ball
far
away
from
the
danger
zone
the
play
went
on
fairly
evenly
again
until
five
minutes
to
twelve
i
felt
wild
with
anxiety
and
i
am
sure
the
others
did
too
for
there
were
only
five
minutes
left
the
ball
had
just
been
sent
over
the
line
by
one
of
the
clinton
girls
and
our
left
half
rolled
in
the
wing
missed
the
bill
but
ingred
took
it
and
well
i
can
not
tell
you
clearly
what
happened
after
that
i
still
have
in
my
mind
the
picture
of
ingred
who
the
ball
at
her
side
literally
flew
up
the
field
her
feet
scarcely
touching
the
ground
no
one
knows
how
she
did
it
but
by
some
marvellous
playing
she
passed
all
her
opponents
and
shot
the
only
goal
of
the
whole
match
just
three
seconds
before
the
whistle
blew
for
of
course
ingred
was
the
heroine
of
the
hour
as
she
was
being
escorted
to
the
pavilion
flushed
but
triumphant
miss
giles
said
to
her
played
i
am
proud
of
you
those
few
words
of
praise
meant
a
good
deal
to
ingred
and
we
all
felt
how
well
she
deserved
them
especially
as
it
was
only
by
accident
that
she
played
in
the
team
at
all
i
do
hope
i
have
not
tired
you
by
going
too
fully
into
our
match
but
i
know
you
are
interested
in
our
school
games
hockey
in
particular
i
will
tell
you
about
our
later
fixtures
when
i
see
you
at
christmas
so
until
then
with
love
from
your
affectionate
cousin
nora
clifford
chapter
viii
an
unpleasant
experience
the
girls
filed
out
from
the
hockey
ground
as
speedily
as
possible
there
was
a
train
due
from
grovebury
in
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
they
walked
to
the
station
in
groups
discussing
details
of
the
match
as
they
went
ingred
beatrice
and
verity
happened
to
be
blocked
at
the
exit
by
the
clintonian
team
and
were
obliged
to
wait
some
minutes
before
they
could
pass
and
when
at
last
they
were
through
the
gate
all
their
own
schoolfellows
were
disappearing
up
the
road
we
need
run
after
them
i
believe
we
plenty
of
time
said
verity
we
can
almost
see
the
station
from
here
i
say
are
you
fearfully
hungry
i
literally
starving
let
find
a
and
each
buy
a
bun
before
we
go
both
beatrice
and
ingred
felt
that
they
required
fortifying
before
they
started
for
home
so
they
dived
into
the
nearest
and
demanded
buns
they
were
eating
them
rather
hastily
when
linda
slater
entered
the
shop
in
company
with
a
gentleman
evidently
her
father
she
hailed
her
and
at
once
began
to
talk
over
the
match
and
rejoice
at
the
school
victory
who
says
we
no
good
at
games
now
this
has
sent
up
our
credit
ten
per
cent
i
proud
of
the
blossom
was
exulted
verity
and
janie
was
simply
ripping
dad
thought
no
end
of
her
did
you
dad
well
i
glad
we
made
something
of
a
record
admitted
ingred
i
say
declared
beatrice
hastily
finishing
her
bun
if
that
right
we
must
bolt
for
our
train
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
one
minute
slow
exclaimed
linda
consulting
her
watch
you
have
to
sprint
are
coming
no
we
have
our
car
here
it
outside
those
girls
will
hardly
catch
their
train
remarked
slater
to
linda
as
the
three
went
to
the
pay
desk
to
settle
for
their
buns
could
we
stow
them
into
the
car
and
take
them
along
with
us
oh
no
dad
frowned
linda
there
really
is
room
you
promised
you
call
at
brantbury
and
bring
gerald
and
eustace
back
for
the
afternoon
we
could
cram
them
all
in
the
car
there
is
time
for
them
to
get
the
train
oh
yes
you
do
know
how
they
can
run
quite
unaware
of
the
kindly
offer
which
had
been
rejected
on
their
behalf
beatrice
verity
and
ingred
fled
from
the
shop
and
hurried
with
all
possible
speed
in
the
direction
of
the
railway
station
they
could
see
the
train
coming
along
the
top
of
the
embankment
and
it
had
drawn
up
at
the
platform
before
they
reached
the
passenger
entrance
they
were
not
the
only
late
comers
it
was
saturday
and
a
crowd
of
work
people
from
various
factories
near
were
returning
to
grovebury
in
company
with
a
very
mixed
and
motley
crew
they
pushed
their
way
up
the
long
flight
of
steps
a
collector
stood
at
the
top
and
just
as
they
were
nearing
their
goal
he
slammed
the
gate
and
refused
further
admission
to
the
platform
they
could
hear
the
whistle
and
the
general
bumping
of
chains
that
betokened
the
starting
of
the
carriages
they
were
exactly
half
a
minute
too
late
when
the
train
was
well
out
of
the
station
the
collector
once
more
opened
his
barrier
and
the
crowd
surged
on
the
three
girls
who
disliked
pushing
among
a
rough
assembly
stood
on
one
side
to
let
the
people
pass
by
there
was
no
hurry
now
and
no
object
to
be
gained
by
forcing
their
way
ahead
last
of
all
therefore
they
presented
themselves
at
the
gate
tickets
please
repeated
the
collector
automatically
all
three
felt
in
their
pockets
but
felt
in
vain
return
tickets
and
purses
were
alike
missing
and
even
penknives
and
handkerchiefs
had
vanished
ingred
pocket
indeed
was
neatly
turned
inside
out
here
was
a
dilemma
they
had
evidently
been
robbed
on
the
stairs
by
a
professional
thief
who
had
appropriated
all
their
portable
belongings
in
utter
consternation
they
looked
at
one
another
we
lost
our
tickets
faltered
beatrice
they
been
stolen
added
ingred
do
please
let
us
through
entreated
verity
in
ordinary
circumstanced
the
collector
would
no
doubt
have
listened
to
the
girl
story
and
taken
them
to
interview
the
but
he
had
to
do
double
duty
and
could
scarcely
cope
with
the
extra
work
he
had
to
deal
with
crowds
and
to
keep
a
sharp
eye
to
see
that
no
one
defrauded
the
railway
company
by
travelling
without
paying
the
fare
a
train
was
due
at
the
next
moment
on
the
other
side
of
the
platform
and
his
services
were
urgently
required
at
the
opposite
exit
have
you
got
your
tickets
he
demanded
curtly
then
i
must
close
the
gate
no
one
allowed
on
the
platform
without
tickets
the
advancing
train
whistled
as
it
ran
through
the
cutting
and
disregarding
the
girls
remonstrances
the
official
locked
the
barrier
he
bolted
across
the
line
in
front
of
the
engine
just
in
time
to
take
his
place
at
the
other
gateway
before
the
rush
of
passengers
began
and
probably
never
gave
another
thought
to
the
three
whom
he
had
just
excluded
left
shut
out
on
the
top
of
the
station
steps
the
unlucky
trio
ruefully
reviewed
the
situation
what
we
to
do
demanded
ingred
breathlessly
goodness
only
knows
sighed
verity
we
in
a
very
awkward
fix
admitted
beatrice
they
were
much
too
far
from
grovebury
to
make
walking
possible
i
wonder
miss
giles
did
miss
us
fretted
verity
trying
to
throw
the
blame
on
somebody
it
is
her
fault
fair
play
to
her
urged
beatrice
she
looking
after
us
officially
you
know
on
saturdays
supposed
to
be
on
our
own
i
lay
the
blame
on
buns
said
ingred
we
have
kept
with
the
rest
of
the
school
if
we
had
stopped
at
that
confectioner
well
it
no
use
crying
over
spilt
milk
now
what
we
got
to
do
is
to
find
some
means
of
getting
home
we
ca
stay
here
all
day
i
believe
it
not
very
far
to
waverley
from
denscourt
ventured
beatrice
if
we
can
manage
to
walk
i
know
some
people
who
live
at
a
house
there
i
ask
them
to
lend
us
our
fares
and
we
could
catch
a
train
at
waverley
station
the
idea
seemed
feasible
and
as
it
was
the
only
one
that
suggested
itself
they
unanimously
decided
to
adopt
it
they
walked
down
the
steps
again
therefore
on
to
the
high
road
and
stopping
a
girl
who
was
passing
asked
the
way
to
waverley
it
a
good
four
miles
by
the
road
but
it
only
about
two
by
the
fields
she
volunteered
in
reply
i
think
you
find
the
path
you
go
down
the
road
to
the
right
and
turn
through
the
first
gate
across
a
field
to
a
farm
then
you
keep
along
the
river
bank
on
the
left
you
ca
miss
it
to
save
two
miles
in
their
present
predicament
was
a
matter
of
importance
and
they
all
felt
that
they
would
greatly
prefer
walking
through
fields
to
tramping
along
a
dusty
high
road
thanking
their
informant
they
took
her
advice
and
set
off
in
the
direction
which
she
indicated
after
all
the
affair
was
rather
an
adventure
the
mortons
are
sure
to
offer
us
lunch
when
we
get
there
affirmed
beatrice
of
course
we
shall
be
fearfully
late
home
and
our
people
will
be
getting
very
anxious
about
us
but
we
ca
help
that
i
was
to
have
gone
to
a
matinÃ©e
of
this
afternoon
but
it
off
naturally
i
expect
doris
will
use
my
ticket
when
i
do
turn
up
i
meant
to
wash
our
dog
when
i
got
back
laughed
ingred
he
have
to
look
dirty
on
sunday
now
and
i
meant
to
do
a
hundred
things
but
what
the
use
of
talking
about
them
now
groaned
verity
here
our
farm
and
that
appears
to
be
the
river
over
there
did
that
girl
say
along
to
the
left
perhaps
we
better
ask
again
they
verified
their
instructions
from
a
boy
who
was
standing
in
the
farmyard
whittling
a
stick
and
trudged
away
over
a
stubble
field
and
through
a
turnstile
gate
it
was
quite
pretty
along
the
path
by
the
river
there
was
a
tall
hedge
where
hips
and
haws
showed
red
and
a
grassy
border
where
a
few
wild
flowers
still
bloomed
the
sun
shed
a
soft
golden
autumnal
haze
over
the
fields
and
bushes
and
the
lines
of
yellow
trees
the
girls
rather
enjoyed
themselves
it
was
an
unexpected
country
excursion
and
had
all
the
charm
of
novelty
they
walked
about
half
a
mile
chatting
about
school
matters
as
they
went
then
suddenly
they
were
confronted
by
an
alternative
a
bridge
spanned
the
river
and
the
broad
path
along
which
they
had
come
turned
over
the
bridge
there
was
indeed
a
track
that
continued
along
the
left
bank
but
it
was
and
looked
little
used
which
were
they
to
take
that
was
a
question
which
required
discussion
the
girl
said
along
the
river
bank
on
the
left
urged
ingred
yet
the
path
so
plainly
goes
across
here
demurred
verity
that
certainly
the
left
bank
but
that
way
looks
as
if
it
led
to
nowhere
vacillated
beatrice
ca
we
ask
anybody
there
is
a
soul
in
sight
is
there
a
signpost
nothing
of
the
sort
then
which
way
we
go
better
take
votes
on
it
i
for
meadow
and
i
for
the
highway
so
am
i
so
we
two
to
one
i
give
in
then
said
ingred
only
i
a
sort
of
feeling
going
wrong
all
the
same
the
new
path
led
along
the
opposite
bank
and
was
very
much
a
replica
of
the
former
it
ran
on
and
on
for
what
seemed
quite
a
long
distance
but
they
met
nobody
from
whom
they
could
inquire
the
way
for
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
mile
a
belt
of
trees
obscured
the
view
and
when
at
last
the
prospect
could
once
more
be
seen
beatrice
stopped
short
with
a
groan
of
despair
on
the
other
side
of
the
water
was
the
unmistakable
spire
of
waverley
church
we
come
wrong
after
all
oh
good
night
so
we
have
what
an
absolute
swindle
the
girls
were
certainly
not
in
luck
that
day
they
had
missed
their
path
as
effectually
as
they
had
missed
their
train
the
chimneys
of
waverley
were
in
sight
but
separated
from
them
by
a
wide
stream
and
unless
they
were
prepared
to
wade
swim
or
fly
there
was
no
way
of
reaching
the
village
there
nothing
for
it
but
to
turn
back
why
but
that
are
you
sure
it
waverley
over
there
can
we
ask
anybody
no
one
to
ask
worse
luck
yes
there
is
i
can
see
some
people
coming
along
in
a
boat
rendered
desperate
by
the
emergency
ingred
struggled
through
the
reeds
to
the
very
edge
of
the
river
and
lifted
up
her
voice
in
an
agonized
cry
of
help
a
punt
was
drifting
slowly
with
the
current
and
its
occupants
a
lady
and
gentleman
looked
with
surprise
at
the
agitated
girl
who
was
hailing
them
from
the
bank
the
gentleman
at
once
paddled
in
her
direction
and
running
his
little
craft
among
the
reeds
inquired
what
was
the
matter
oh
please
is
that
waverley
over
there
asked
ingred
anxiously
we
lost
our
way
and
we
walked
miles
is
there
any
bridge
near
that
certainly
waverley
but
there
no
bridge
till
you
come
to
one
a
mile
and
a
half
down
stream
ingred
face
was
tragic
she
turned
to
beatrice
and
verity
who
had
joined
her
it
no
use
we
shall
have
to
go
back
but
the
lady
was
whispering
something
to
the
gentleman
and
he
beckoned
to
the
girls
with
a
smile
do
run
away
he
said
look
here
we
punt
you
across
if
you
like
like
the
girls
hardly
knew
how
to
express
their
gratitude
the
three
of
you
be
too
heavy
a
load
i
think
i
better
take
just
one
at
a
time
can
you
manage
to
get
in
it
rather
swampy
here
give
me
your
hand
ingred
splashed
ankle
deep
in
oozy
mud
as
she
scrambled
on
board
but
that
was
a
trifle
compared
with
the
relief
of
being
ferried
over
the
river
her
was
neither
young
nor
handsome
being
indeed
rather
bald
and
stout
but
no
orthodox
interesting
hero
of
fiction
could
have
been
more
welcome
at
the
moment
she
tendered
her
utmost
thanks
as
she
landed
again
with
damage
to
her
shoes
on
the
rushy
bank
opposite
their
friends
in
need
having
successfully
punted
over
beatrice
and
verity
also
bade
them
a
laughing
and
resumed
their
easy
course
down
stream
leaving
three
very
grateful
girls
behind
them
illustration
a
friend
in
need
that
helped
us
out
of
a
fix
do
say
again
we
no
luck
cried
beatrice
wiping
her
boots
carefully
on
the
grass
they
were
angels
in
disguise
sighed
ingred
rather
stout
angels
chuckled
verity
now
how
are
we
going
to
get
out
of
this
field
over
the
hedge
i
suppose
there
a
piece
of
fence
that
looks
climbable
returned
beatrice
swinging
herself
up
with
elephantine
grace
and
dropping
with
a
heavy
thud
on
the
other
side
oh
good
biz
we
on
a
cinder
path
they
were
indeed
in
a
back
lane
which
led
at
the
bottom
of
some
gardens
then
behind
a
row
of
stables
and
finally
through
a
gate
on
to
the
high
road
i
know
where
we
are
now
exclaimed
beatrice
gleefully
it
only
quite
a
short
way
to
the
morton
they
live
in
the
next
terrace
but
two
i
believe
we
within
measurable
distance
of
some
lunch
this
was
such
good
news
that
they
strode
along
in
renewed
spirits
considering
all
they
thought
the
adventure
was
turning
out
well
a
meal
would
undoubtedly
be
most
acceptable
if
beatrice
friends
were
hospitable
enough
to
offer
it
it
the
fourth
house
said
beatrice
the
one
with
the
copper
beech
over
the
gate
linden
lea
yes
here
we
are
oh
i
say
what
are
all
the
blinds
down
for
the
girls
faced
each
other
blankly
is
anyone
dead
faltered
ingred
i
ring
and
inquire
at
any
rate
murmured
beatrice
so
she
rang
and
rang
again
and
yet
again
she
could
hear
the
bell
clanging
quite
plainly
and
unmistakably
somewhere
in
the
back
regions
yet
nobody
came
to
the
door
it
funny
i
do
hear
anybody
in
the
house
either
she
remarked
their
dog
generally
barks
at
the
least
sound
at
that
moment
a
small
face
peeped
over
the
top
of
the
wall
which
divided
the
garden
from
that
of
the
next
house
and
a
childish
voice
asked
do
you
want
the
mortons
yes
is
anybody
in
they
all
gone
away
to
llandudno
for
a
month
all
is
anyone
here
no
the
house
is
locked
up
here
a
warning
call
of
willie
caused
their
informant
to
disappear
as
suddenly
as
he
had
come
but
the
girls
had
heard
enough
all
their
hopes
were
suddenly
blighted
they
had
arrived
at
the
end
of
their
journey
only
to
draw
a
blank
they
were
indeed
in
a
worse
position
than
when
they
had
missed
the
train
at
denscourt
for
they
were
farther
from
home
and
it
was
much
later
almost
ready
to
cry
they
turned
down
the
garden
again
we
got
to
get
home
somehow
said
ingred
through
her
set
teeth
shall
we
go
to
the
police
station
quavered
verity
and
give
ourselves
up
like
lost
children
no
it
too
undignified
wait
a
moment
i
got
an
idea
said
beatrice
we
passed
the
post
office
just
now
and
i
noticed
it
had
a
telephone
i
ring
up
mother
and
tell
her
where
we
are
and
ask
her
to
come
over
for
us
but
you
ca
telephone
for
nothing
and
we
have
so
much
as
a
solitary
penny
amongst
us
i
know
i
thought
i
explain
that
to
the
people
at
the
post
office
and
ask
them
to
let
me
have
the
call
and
mother
will
pay
when
she
comes
i
could
give
them
my
watch
as
a
security
it
worth
trying
so
with
just
a
little
grain
of
hope
they
retraced
their
steps
to
the
post
office
which
was
also
a
stationer
and
newsagent
nobody
was
in
the
shop
but
when
the
girls
thumped
on
the
counter
a
young
person
appeared
from
the
back
regions
want
to
telephone
without
paying
it
against
the
post
office
rules
she
snapped
as
beatrice
briefly
explained
the
circumstances
my
mother
will
pay
when
she
comes
and
if
you
take
my
watch
i
ca
go
against
post
office
rules
all
calls
must
be
paid
for
beforehand
that
our
instructions
but
just
for
once
what
the
matter
doris
asked
a
voice
and
a
little
man
emerged
from
the
back
parlor
wiping
his
mouth
hastily
and
took
his
place
behind
the
counter
beatrice
turned
to
him
with
eagerness
and
again
stated
the
urgency
of
their
peculiar
situation
well
of
course
we
our
instructions
from
the
post
office
and
got
to
account
for
the
calls
but
in
this
particular
case
we
might
let
you
have
one
and
pay
afterwards
he
replied
oh
never
mind
the
watch
it
all
right
beatrice
lost
no
time
in
ringing
up
number
grovebury
and
to
her
immense
delight
when
she
got
the
connection
she
heard
her
voice
at
the
instrument
a
short
explanation
was
all
that
was
necessary
stay
where
you
are
at
the
waverley
post
office
and
i
will
get
a
taxi
and
fetch
you
myself
immediately
returned
jackson
it
the
greatest
relief
to
know
what
has
become
of
you
i
was
going
to
ring
up
the
police
station
and
describe
you
as
the
girls
had
to
wait
nearly
of
an
hour
before
the
taxi
made
its
appearance
and
the
welcome
form
of
jackson
stepped
out
of
it
she
paid
what
was
owing
for
the
call
thanked
the
postmaster
for
his
civility
and
hustled
the
girls
into
the
conveyance
as
quickly
as
possible
i
suppose
girls
will
be
girls
she
said
but
i
think
you
been
very
silly
ones
why
did
you
keep
with
the
rest
of
the
school
as
you
ought
to
have
done
it
sounds
a
most
horrible
greedy
confession
replied
beatrice
guiltily
but
i
afraid
it
was
all
the
fault
of
buns
they
just
threw
us
late
and
we
missed
the
others
we
never
buy
buns
again
never
never
peccavi
we
have
sinned
and
she
looked
so
humorously
contrite
that
jackson
who
was
inclined
to
scold
laughed
in
spite
of
herself
and
forgave
the
delinquents
on
condition
that
such
a
thing
does
happen
again
she
declared
trust
us
we
would
go
through
such
an
experience
again
for
all
the
buns
in
the
world
next
time
we
cling
to
the
college
apron
strings
like
like
like
adhesive
supplied
ingred
gently
or
oysters

murmured
verity
chapter
ix
a
hostel
frolic
the
foursome
league
which
verity
had
instituted
with
her
at
the
hostel
was
kept
by
them
as
a
solemn
compact
they
stuck
to
one
another
nobly
though
often
in
the
teeth
of
great
inconvenience
it
generally
took
three
of
them
to
urge
fil
through
her
toilet
in
the
mornings
and
drag
her
down
to
breakfast
in
time
she
was
always
so
terribly
sleepy
at
seven
and
so
positive
that
she
could
whisk
through
her
dressing
in
ten
minutes
and
that
it
was
quite
unnecessary
to
get
up
so
soon
even
when
the
others
mercilessly
pulled
the
from
her
and
pointed
to
their
watches
she
would
dawdle
instead
of
whisking
and
spend
much
superfluous
time
over
manicure
or
dabbing
on
cucumber
cream
to
improve
her
complexion
she
was
so
innocent
about
her
little
vanities
and
conducted
them
with
such
complacency
that
the
girls
tolerated
them
quite
good
humoredly
and
even
assisted
sometimes
one
of
them
generally
volunteered
to
brush
her
long
flaxen
hair
and
tie
her
ribbon
and
half
out
of
habit
the
others
would
tidy
her
cubicle
which
was
apt
to
be
chaotic
and
put
her
things
away
in
her
drawers
they
did
it
almost
automatically
for
they
had
come
to
look
upon
fil
somewhat
in
the
light
of
a
big
doll
the
exclusive
property
of
the
foursome
league
and
to
be
treated
as
the
mascot
of
the
dormitory
best
the
hostel
matron
was
what
the
girls
called
rather
an
old
dear
her
gray
hair
was
picturesque
and
the
knowledge
that
she
had
lost
her
husband
and
a
son
in
the
war
added
an
element
of
pathetic
interest
to
her
personality
she
was
experienced
in
the
ways
of
girls
and
contrived
to
keep
order
without
seeming
to
be
constantly
obtruding
rules
among
her
various
sane
practices
she
instituted
the
plan
of
awarding
marks
for
good
conduct
and
order
to
each
dormitory
and
allowing
the
one
which
scored
the
highest
to
give
an
entertainment
to
the
others
during
the
last
hour
before
bedtime
on
thursday
night
naturally
this
was
a
privilege
to
be
desired
it
was
fun
to
act
variety
artistes
before
the
rest
of
the
hostel
and
well
worth
being
in
time
for
meals
preserving
silence
during
or
getting
up
a
little
earlier
so
as
to
leave
cubicles
in
order
the
foursome
league
had
not
yet
earned
distinction
chiefly
owing
to
lapses
on
the
part
of
fil
and
nora
incorrigible
love
of
talking
in
season
and
out
of
season
one
week
however
after
a
really
heroic
series
of
efforts
they
succeeded
in
establishing
a
record
and
sat
perking
themselves
at
when

when
we
to

up
twittered
verity
what
silly
idiots
we
were
not
to
plan
it
all
out
beforehand
but
i
really
never
dreamt
we
ever
get
the
chance
no
more

said
ingred
sitting
with
her
head
in
her
hands
considering
on
the
whole
it
does
matter
sometimes
a
quite
impromptu
thing
goes
off
best
it
largely
a
question
of
what
costumes
we
can
rake
up

of
nothing
the
cleverer
those
are
the
more
we
get

i
one
or

thank
goodness
it
drawing
this
afternoon
and
i
shall
have
time
to
think
them
over
we
all

then
we
compare
notes
at
four
and
fix
on

the
noticed
a
slacking
off
in
accuracy
on
the
part
of
four
of
her
pupils
that
afternoon
she
perhaps
set
it
down
to
want
of
artistic
feeling
it
is
difficult
to
copy
with
absolute
exactness
when
only
your
fingers
are
busy
and
your
brain
is
far
away
ingred
planned
enough
entertainments
to
supply
a
pierrot
troupe
for
a
month
but
abandoned
most
of
them
as
being
quite
impossible
to
act
with
the
very
limited
resources
that
were
available
at
the
hostel
at
a
select
foursome
committee
after
school
however
she
presented
the
pick
of
the
performances
and
as
nobody
else
had
thought
of
anything
better
or
indeed
quite
so
good
her
suggestions
with
a
few
amendments
and
alterations
were
carried
unanimously
at
eight
that
evening
when
preparation
was
finished
the
boarders
room
was
rapidly
transformed
into
an
amateur
theater
the
trestle
tables
were
carried
to
one
end
to
form
the
gallery
rows
of
chairs
represented
the
dress
circle
and
cushions
in
front
either
the
pit
or
the
stalls
according
to
individual
taste
or
as
best
said
the
behavior
of
the
occupants
there
was
no
curtain
but
as
the
scenery
preserved
shakespearian
methods
of
simplicity
that
did
not
matter
part
of
the
charm
of
these
thursday
night
entertainments
was
their
absolutely
spontaneous
character
and
the
fact
that
many
details
had
to
be
left
to
the
imagination
of
the
spectators
only
made
things
more
amusing
when
the
audience
after
a
slight
struggle
for
gallery
seats
had
settled
itself
and
best
and
nurse
warner
had
taken
possession
of
the
specially
reserved
for
them
dollie
ransome
who
had
been
requisitioned
by
the
performers
to
act
as
greek
chorus
placed
some
stools
by
the
and
announced
importantly
king
alfred
and
the
cakes
a
historical
drama
the
little
old
woman
who
entered
carrying
some
sticks
and
a
basin
was
difficult
to
identify
as
fil
her
fair
hair
had
been
powdered
wrinkles
were
painted
on
her
smooth
forehead
a
handkerchief
was
knotted
on
her
head
for
a
cap
and
she
wore
an
apron
borrowed
from
the
cook
and
a
check
arranged
as
a
shawl
she
bestowed
the
sticks
in
the
fender
to
represent
a
fire
on
the
hearth
and
taking
some
biscuits
from
her
basin
placed
them
amongst
the
supposed
embers
indulging
meanwhile
in
a
soliloquy
about
the
hardness
of
the
times
for
poor
folk
and
the
danger
from
the
danes
a
violent
knocking
on
the
door
was
followed
by
the
entrance
of
such
a
magnificent
object
that
the
spectators
immediately
applauded
his
advent
nora
with
her
large
build
hair
and
generally
boyish
appearance
was
the
very
one
to
act
king
alfred
she
had
folded
a
plaid
traveling
rug
into
a
kilt
which
reached
just
to
her
bare
knees
borrowed
a
velvet
coatee
and
a
leather
belt
from
best
and
by
the
aid
of
bandages
from
the
ambulance
cupboard
had
made
quite
a
good
imitation
of
saxon
armed
with
a
bow
and
arrows
hastily
constructed
from
twigs
cut
in
the
garden
she
advanced
with
a
manly
stride
begged
for
hospitality
and
was
accommodated
with
a
stool
by
the
hearth
where
she
sat
whittling
arrows
in
an
abstracted
fashion
and
heaving
gusty
sighs
the
audience
had
hardly
recovered
from
its
astonishment
when
it
was
thrilled
again
by
the
entrance
of
an
ancient
and
elderly
peasant
man
so
disguised
that
it
was
almost
impossible
to
recognize
ingred
a
with
a
broad
leather
belt
served
as
coat
and
being
padded
inside
with
a
pillow
gave
the
effect
of
bent
and
bowed
shoulders
some
tow
supplied
by
best
was
fastened
as
a
long
straggling
beard
and
bushy
eyebrows
of
the
same
material
were
fixed
on
with
soap
leaning
heavily
upon
a
stick
he
came
limping
in
complaining
in
a
tremulous
voice
of
his
rheumatism
started
with
amazement
at
the
sight
of
the
handsome
stranger
seated
by
his
hearth
and
drew
his
wife
aside
for
explanations
the
old
couple
after
conversing
in
audible
whispers
decided
to
go
out
for
more
firewood
and
as
a
last
charge
the
dame
commended
her
cakes
to
the
care
of
their
guest
king
alfred
on
being
left
alone
by
the
hearth
whittled
away
at
his
arrows
with
more
energy
than
discrimination
and
showed
indeed
a
sad
lack
of
practical
skill
for
so
well
seasoned
a
warrior
perhaps
however
he
was
not
accustomed
to
have
to
make
them
for
himself
and
missed
his
chief
archer
throwing
them
down
at
last
he
sank
his
head
in
his
hands
in
an
absolute
cinema
pose
of
despondency
and
sighed
to
an
extent
which
must
have
been
painful
to
his
lungs
the
dame
returned
to
sniff
burning
cakes
and
fly
to
the
rescue
of
her
cookery
fil
was
quite
a
good
little
actress
and
produced
what
she
considered
her
de
she
had
spent
her
summer
holidays
in
somerset
and
had
there
picked
up
a
local
ballad
which
dealt
with
the
legend
in
dialect
she
brought
out
a
verse
of
it
now
with
great
effect

the
man

cus

and
catching
up
a
biscuit
carefully
blackened
beforehand
by
toasting
it
over
the
gas
she
flaunted
it
in
the
face
of
the
embarrassed
monarch
the
dramatic
situation
was
slightly
spoilt
by
the
delay
in
the
entrance
of
the
courtier
who
ought
to
have
come
in
at
that
psychological
moment
and
did
the
fact
was
that
verity
finding
it
dull
waiting
in
the
passage
had
run
upstairs
to
make
some
additions
to
her
costume
and
had
miscalculated
the
length
or
rather
shortness
of
the
act
it
is
difficult
for
the
most
accomplished
actor
to
go
on
looking
embarrassed
for
any
length
of
time
and
as
fil
eloquence
in
the
scolding
line
suddenly
failed
her
there
was
an
awful
pause
while
the
peasant
husband
with
wonderful
agility
considering
his
rheumatism
hopped
to
the
door
and
called
agitatedly
for
the
missing
performer
the
courtier
flew
downstairs
like
a
whirlwind
tripped
into
the
room
and
fell
upon
his
knees
to
do
homage
to
his
sovereign
who
rose
majestically
and
extended
a
hand
of
pardon
to
the
now
grovelling
peasant
the
audience
particularly
that
portion
seated
in
the
gallery
clapped
and
cheered
to
such
an
extent
that
one
of
the
trestles
which
had
been
carelessly
fixed
collapsed
and
sent
a
whole
row
of
girls
sliding
on
to
the
floor
whence
they
were
rescued
speechless
with
laughter
but
uninjured
they
came
crowding
round
the
performers
to
admire
the
costumes
they
topping
how
you
think
of
them
i
like
king
alfred
legs
ingred
you
look
about
a
hundred
fil
scold
verity
what
was
a
courtier
doing
rambling
about
a
forest
in
a
blue
it
would
get
torn
on
the
bushes
i
know
we
told
her
so
but
she
wear
it
declared
ingred
she
was
just
over
that
well
go
and
look
at
the
saxon
pictures
for
yourself
in
the
history
book
retorted
verity
sticking
to
her
point
you
see
the
courtiers
in
long
flowing
garments
very
like
i
think
it
was
a
capital
idea
and
the
best
i
could
do
there
was
another
rug
for
the
kilt
anyhow
and
when
other
people
have
taken
the
best
parts
and
the
nicest
costumes
you
just
got
to
put
up
with
anything
you
can
find
that
left
you
did
it
so
well
ingred
assured
her
hastily
for
verity
had
gone
very
pink
and
her
voice
sounded
distinctly
offended
i
thought
the
way
you
dropped
on
one
knee
and
cried
liege
lord
i
am
your
humble
socman
was
most
impressive
what
made
you
think
of
got
it
out
of
the
history
book
said
verity
slightly
mollified
it
means
a
man
who
owned
land
but
was
quite
as
high
up
as
a
thane
i
meant
to
bring
in
some
more
saxon
words
but
i
had
time
you
must
win
the
dormitory
score
again
and
give
us
another
performance
urged
best
i
afraid
it
too
late
for
any
more
though
we
all
sorry
to
stop
those
juniors
ought
to
be
in
bed
janie
and
doreen
if
you
like
a
quiet
to
finish
your
prep
you
may
go
into
my
room
somebody
put
the
tables
back
please
and
be
sure
the
trestles
are
in
their
right
places
this
time
we
do
want
another
collapse
phyllis
your
cough
worse
nurse
shall
rub
your
chest
with
camphorated
oil
and
you
must
kiss
anybody
betty
too
i
give
you
a
lozenge
but
do
suck
it
lying
down
in
bed
in
case
you
choke
so
saying
best
who
generally
mothered
the
hostel
dismissed
her
large
family
and
bustled
away
with
nurse
to
superintend
the
putting
to
bed
of
the
juniors
and
the
due
care
of
those
who
might
be
regarded
as
even
ever
so
slightly
on
the
sick
list
it
was
perhaps
owing
to
the
excitement
of
their
spirited
performance
that
the
members
of
no
dormitory
could
not
get
to
sleep
that
night
they
all
lay
wide
awake
in
bed
and
told
each
other
tales
about
burglars
in
whispers
stories
were
in
the
extreme
she
was
a
great
reader
and
had
got
them
from
magazines
her
three
listened
with
cold
shivers
running
down
their
spines
according
to
verity
accounts
it
was
a
common
and
every
day
occurrence
for
a
to
force
an
entrance
murder
the
occupants
and
depart
leaving
a
case
to
baffle
the
police
until
some
amateur
detective
turned
up
and
solved
the
mystery
has
it
ever
struck
you
that
the
hostel
would
be
a
very
easy
place
to
burgle
asked
fil
those
french
windows
have
no
shutters
and
the
glass
could
be
cut
with
a
diamond
or
the
doors
could
be
opened
with
a
skeleton
key
quavered
nora
i
suppose
they
generally
wear
goloshes
so
as
to
tread
softly
ventured
ingred
would
it
be
dreadful
continued
verity
whose
mind
still
ran
on
magazine
stories
to
marry
a
fascinating
man
whom
you
met
by
chance
and
then
find
out
that
he
was
a
what
would
you
do
it
often
happens
on
the
cinema
said
nora
the
girl
wavers
about
in
an
agony
whether
to
tell
or
not
and
wrings
her
hands
and
rolls
her
eyes
like
they
always
roll
them
on
the
films
and
then
just
when
things
are
at
the
very
last
gasp
the
husband
tumbles
over
a
precipice
or
is
wrecked
at
sea
or
smashed
in
a
railway
accident
and
she
marries
the
other
who
as
good
as
gold
and
loved
her
first
is
the
man
who
loves
you
first
always
as
good
as
gold
asked
fil
well
generally
on
the
pictures
he
loved
you
as
a
child
you
see
you
come
on
the
film
hand
in
hand
in
socks
and
he
gives
you
his
apple
but
suppose
they
do
love
you
from
a
child
said
fil
plaintively
i
only
known
a
lot
of
horrid
little
boys
whom
i
did
care
for
in
the
least
none
of
them
ever
gave
me
his
apple
though
i
remember
one
taking
mine
is
the
first
fascinating
man
i
meet
the
true
lover
or
the
burglar
how
am
i
to
know
which
is
which
you
better
let
me
be
there
to
decide
for
you
child
or
you
be
snapped
up
by
the
first
adventurer
that
comes
along
declared
nora
do
trust
him
if
he
has
a
mustache
dick
of
the
black
had
a
little
twisted
mustache
like
mephistopheles
in
oh
dear
and
the
last
piece
i
saw
on
the
pictures
the
villain
was
clean
shaven
that
no
guide
at
all
girls

breaking
the
silence

said
best
opening
the
door
of
dormitory
where
the
conversation
which
had
begun
in
whispers
had
risen
to
a
pitch
audible
on
the
landing
outside
this
does
look
like
scoring
again
next
week
and
giving
another
performance
why
nora
the
rain
driving
through
that
open
window
straight
on
to
your
bed
you
be
getting
rheumatism
i
shall
shut
it
and
leave
the
door
wide
open
for
air
instead
now
be
good
girls
and
go
to
sleep
at
once
do
let
me
hear
any
more
talking
the
foursomes
in
common
with
most
of
the
hostel
were
fond
of
best
so
they
turned
over
obediently
and
composed
themselves
to
slumber
they
were
really
tired
by
this
time
and
dropped
off
into
the
land
of
nod
before
the
clock
on
the
stairs
had
chimed
another
quarter
how
long
she
slept
ingred
did
not
know
she
dreamt
quite
a
long
and
circumstantial
dream
of
wandering
on
the
cliffs
near
the
sea
with
a
who
was
telling
her
his
intention
of
raiding
buckingham
palace
and
taking
away
the
crown
jewels
and
she
heard
his
daring
designs
as
we
always
do
in
dreams
without
the
slightest
surprise
or
any
suggestion
that
the
crown
jewels
are
kept
at
the
tower
instead
of
at
buckingham
palace
she
woke
suddenly
and
laughed
at
the
absurdity
of
the
idea
she
felt
hot
and
threw
back
her
eiderdown
the
other
girls
were
sleeping
quietly
and
the
rain
was
still
beating
against
the
window
in
heavy
showers
for
it
was
a
stormy
night
the
door
of
the
bedroom
stood
wide
open
what
was
that
sound
coming
up
the
stairs
from
the
hall
below
it
was
certainly
not
the
ticking
of
the
clock
it
seemed
more
like
muffled
and
stealthy
footsteps
in
an
instant
ingred
was
very
wide
awake
indeed
and
listening
intently
there
it
came
again
she
could
not
lie
still
and
ignore
it
she
got
out
of
bed
and
with
rather
shaking
knees
walked
on
to
the
landing
and
peeped
over
the
banisters
there
was
a
tiny
hanging
on
the
wall
it
faintly
illuminated
the
stairs
was
that
somebody
moving
about
in
the
darkness
of
the
hall
if
it
was
a
burglar
he
certainly
must
not
come
upstairs
or
she
would
die
of
fright
an
idea
occurred
to
her
and
acting
on
a
sudden
impulse
she
dashed
into
dormitory
roused
the
others
and
told
them
to
snatch
what
missiles
they
could
and
hurry
to
her
aid
we
fling
things
at
him
if
he
tries
to
come
up
she
gasped
groping
for
her
boots
it
was
a
horrible
experience
four
nervous
quaking
girls
stood
in
the
dim
light
on
the
landing
gazing
down
into
the
haunted
blackness
of
the
shadowy
hall
the
sounds
had
ceased
temporarily
but
now
they
began
again
a
distinct
shuffling
as
of
footsteps
and
even
a
subdued
sniff
then
the
outline
of
a
dark
figure
made
its
appearance
bearing
straight
for
the
stairs
with
quite
commendable
bravery
ingred
flung
her
boots
at
it
which
missiles
were
instantly
followed
by

dark
shadow

in
its
movement
towards
the
staircase

it
came

by
the
lamp

itself

familiar

a
situation
the
four
girls
flew
back
to
their
dormitory
in
great
haste

as
best
disturbed
by
the
noise

opened
her
door
and
come
on
to
the
scene

a

were
followed
however
by

matron
and
nurse

to
give
an
explanation
of
their
extraordinary
conduct

more

chapter
x
the
whispering
stones
the
saxon
family
had
squeezed
themselves
and
certain
of
their
possessions
into
the
little
home
at
and
while
flowers
still
bloomed
in
the
garden
and
apples
hung
ripe
on
the
trees
it
seemed
a
kind
of
continuation
of
their
summer
holiday
but
as
the
novelty
wore
off
and
stormy
weather
came
on
their
altered
circumstances
began
to
be
more
evident
most
of
us
can
make
a
plucky
fight
against
fate
at
first
there
had
been
something
rather
romantic
about
retiring
to
the
bungalow
but
the
plain
prose
of
the
proceeding
was
yet
to
come
and
there
were
certainly
many
disadvantages
to
be
faced
saxon
was
worried
about
business
affairs
he
was
a
proud
sensitive
man
and
felt
it
a
great
come
down
to
be
obliged
to
resign
rotherwood
and
the
social
position
it
had
stood
for
and
confess
himself
to
the
world
as
one
of
the
newly
poor
it
was
humiliating
to
have
to
walk
or
take
a
tram
where
he
had
formerly
used
his
car
in
fulfilling
his
professional
engagements
hard
not
to
be
able
to
entertain
his
friends
and
perhaps
hardest
of
all
to
be
obliged
to
refuse
subscriptions
to
the
numerous
charities
in
the
town
where
his
name
had
always
stood
conspicuously
upon
the
liberal
list
his
temper
never
his
strongest
point
suffered
under
the
test
and
he
would
come
home
from
grovebury
in
the
evenings
tired
out
moody
and
fretful
and
inclined
to
find
fault
with
everything
and
everybody
it
took
all
his
wife
sunny
sweetness
of
disposition
to
keep
the
home
atmosphere
cheerful
and
peaceful
for
egbert
also
had
a
temper
and
was
bitterly
disappointed
at
not
being
sent
to
cambridge
and
at
having
to
settle
down
in
the
family
office
instead
father
and
son
did
not
get
on
remarkably
well
together
saxon
like
many
parents
his
boy
business
efforts
and
would
sometimes
to
egbert
huge
indignation
point
out
his
mistakes
before
the
clerks
he
would
declare
in
a
high
and
mighty
way
that
his
own
son
should
not
receive
special
preference
at
the
office
and
so
overdid
his
attitude
of
impartiality
that
he
contrived
to
give
him
a
worse
time
than
any
of
his
other
articled
pupils
athelstane
who
had
begun
his
medical
course
at
the
university
of
birkshaw
also
had
his
troubles
he
had
hoped
to
study
at
guy
hospital
in
preparation
for
the
london
and
to
an
ambitious
young
fellow
it
was
hard
to
be
satisfied
with
a
provincial
degree
the
motor
ride
to
and
from
birkshaw
soon
lost
its
charm
and
the
difficulties
of
home
study
in
the
evenings
were
great
in
a
bungalow
with
thin
partition
walls
and
a
family
not
always
disposed
to
quiet
as
a
rule
he
kept
his
feelings
to
himself
but
he
went
about
with
a
depressed
look
and
got
into
a
habit
of
lifting
his
eyebrows
which
was
leaving
permanent
lines
on
a
hitherto
smooth
and
unwrinkled
forehead
pretty
quenrede
who
had
just
left
school
was
going
through
the
awkward
phase
of
discovering
her
individuality
at
the
college
with
a
full
program
of
lessons
and
games
she
had
followed
the
general
lead
of
the
form
now
cast
upon
her
own
resources
she
was
quite
vague
as
to
any
special
bent
or
taste
the
occupations
which
had
tempted
her
imagination
were
no
longer
available
and
for
did
not
attract
her
even
if
family
funds
had
run
to
the
necessary
training
so
for
the
present
she
stayed
at
home
going
once
a
week
to
the
school
of
art
at
grovebury
and
practicing
singing
in
a
rather
desultory
fashion
though
she
pretended
to
be
glad
she
was
an
emancipated
young
lady
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
missed
school
immensely
and
was
finding
life
decidedly
slow
and
tame
with
their
elders
palpably
dissatisfied
ingred
and
hereward
would
have
been
hardly
human
if
they
had
not
raised
some
personal
grievances
of
their
own
to
grumble
at
and
matters
would
often
have
been
dismal
enough
at
the
bungalow
but
for

capacity
for
looking
on
the
bright
side
of
things
the
whole
household
centered
round
mother
she
was
a
woman
in
a
thousand
naturally
it
had
hurt
her
to
relinquish
rotherwood
and
it
grieved
her
for
the
girls
sake
that
most
of
her
old
acquaintances
in
grovebury
had
not
troubled
to
pay
calls
at
wynchcote
the
small
rooms
the
one
maid
from
the
orphanage

necessity
of
doing
much
of
the
housework
herself
the
difficulties
of
shopping
on
a
limited
purse

her
husband

and
might
have
soured
a
less
unselfish
disposition
she
had
married
however
for
better
or
for
worse
and
took
the
altered
circumstances
with
cheery
optimism
she
was
a
great
lover
of
nature
and
of
scenery
and
the
nearness
of
the
moors
with
their
effects
of
storm
and
sunshine
and
the
opportunities
they
gave
for
the
study
of
birds
and
insects
proved
compensation
for
some
of
the
things
which
life
otherwise
lacked
every
morning
after
the
fuss
of
getting
off
the
family
to
their
several
avocations
she
would
run
down
the
garden
and
stand
for
a
few
minutes
by
the
wall
that
overlooked
the
moor
watching
great
shafts
of
sunlight
fall
from
a
gray
sky
on
to
brown
wastes
of
heather
and
bracken
listening
to
the
call
of
the
curlews
or
to
the
trilling
autumn
warble
of
the
robin
perched
on
the
hawthorn
bush
kind
mother
nature
could
always
soothe
her
spirits
and
send
her
back
with
fresh
courage
for
the
day
work
and
in
the
evening
when
husband
and
children
came
home
to
fire
and
she
had
generally
some
nature
notes
to
tell
them
or
some
amusing
little
incident
to
make
them
laugh
and
forget
their
various
woes

orphan
has
her
bright
side
as
the
orphan
was
a
temporary
member
of
the
wynchcote
establishment
she
merits
a
word
of
description
she
came
from
an
institution
in
the
neighborhood
and
being
the
only
servant
procurable
at
the
time
was
tolerated
in
spite
of
a
terrible
propensity
for
smashing
plates
and
for
carolling
at
the
very
pitch
of
a
nasal
voice
she
was
a
rough
girl
devoted
to
minx
the
cat
and
really
kind
if
anybody
had
a
headache
or
toothache
but
quite
without
any
sense
of
discrimination
she
would
show
a
traveling
hawker
into
the
and
leave
the
clergyman
standing
on
the
doorstep
took
the
best
serviettes
to
wipe
the
china
scoured
the
silver
with
monkey
brand
soap
and
systematically
bespattered
the
kitchen
tablecloth
with
ink
her
love
of
music
was
a
terrible
trial
to
the
medical
student
of
the
family
on
saturday
morning
when
he
was
endeavoring
to
read
at
home

athelstane

day
bursting
forth
from

den
to
complain
of
the
nuisance
but
i

the
old
buffer
did
write
that
sentiment
with
a
howling
popular
songs
in
the
next
room
according
to
all
accounts

loathed
noise
and
could
even
stand
the
crowing
of
a
cock
i
should
call
that
bit
of
eloquence
just
bunkum
if
the
orphan
does
stop
this
business
i
shall
have
to
go
and
slay
her

a

study
in
the

of
such
a
racket

the

down
in

it
was
fairly
early
and
a
hazy
november
sun
had
not
yet
drawn
the
moisture
from
the
heather
on
the
moor
the
few
trees
were
bare

the
golden
autumn
leaves
still
clothed
the

sheltered
valley
that
stretched
below
masses
of

covered
with

bracken
like
fairies

out

was

that
delicious
invigorating
quality
when
every
breath
sets
the
body

it
was
too
late
in
the
year
for
flowers
though
here
and
there
a
little
gorse
lingered
or
a
few
buttercups
and
hawkweeds
after
about
an
hour
of
red
haziness
the
sun
pierced
the
bank
of
mist

shone

them
the
local
mentioned
some
prehistoric
menhirs
and
a
chambered
barrow
on
the
top
of
red
ridge
a
distant
hill
so
they
had
fixed
that
as
their
mecca
it
was
a
considerable
tramp
but
the
bracing
air
helped
them
on
and
they
sat
down
at
last
to
eat
their
lunch
by
the
side

the
path
that
led
to

however
like
a
busy
gossip
had
stepped
in
and
supplied
points
upon
which
history
was
silent
traditions
of
the
neighborhood
explained
the
menhirs
as
twelve
giants
turned
into
stone
by
the
magic
powers
of
good
king
arthur
who
in
defiance
of
the
claims
of
the
isle
of
avalon
was
supposed
to
be
buried
in
a
hitherto
unexplored
chamber
of
the
large
green
mound
that
stood
near

the
story
ran

giants
whispered
to
one
another

any
one

came
there
alone
at
daybreak
on
may
morning
might
glean
much
useful
information
regarding
the
personal
appearance
of
his
or
her
future
lover
as
it
was
obviously
difficult
to
reach
so
a
spot
at
such
a
very
early
hour
the
oracles
were
seldom
consulted
at
the
one
and
only
moment

to
whisper

down

walk
bareheaded
in

in

out
round
all
the

then
you
put
an
offering
of
flowers
on
that
biggest
stone

called

into

she
removed
her
and
letting
down
a
shower
of
flaxen
hair
commenced
her
winding
pilgrimage
among
the
old
gray
stones
there
is
a
vein
of
superstition
in
the
most
modern
of
minds
and
she
was
probably
following
a
custom
that
had
come
down
the
ages
from
the
days
when
our
primitive
ancestresses
clothed
themselves
in
skins
and
twisted
their
prehistoric
locks
with
pins
of
mammoth
ivory
in
and
out
and
in

out
with

like
an
attendant
priestess
behind

performed
the

her
floral
offering

may
have
been
the
remains
of
a
neolithic
altar
the
pool
below
was
dark
and
boggy

brown
with
peat

took
a

and

it
into

splash

oh

whoever
on

that
following
the
direction
of
her
sister
eyes
quenrede
looked
through
a
veil
of
hair
to
see
standing
among
the
stones
a
stranger
of
the
opposite
sex
garbed
in
tweed
knickers
and
leather
gaiters
one
glance
was
enough
the
next
second
she
turned
and
beat
a
hurried
and
ignominious
retreat
to
the
sheltered
side
of
the
green
mound
ingred
panting
in
the
rear
followed
her
to
cover

very
pink

down
on

immediately
began
to
put
up

hair

such
an
idiot

with
energy
to
her
sympathetic
audience

man

what
i

doing
i

the
horrid
amusement
in
his
face
he
was
laughing
at
me
for
all
he
was
worth
i
he
was
at
eighteen
it
is
an
overwhelming
matter
to
be
laughed
at
dignity
was
decidedly
wounded
after
all
it
was
a
very
schoolgirlish
thing
to
do
she
remarked
sticking
in
as
well
as
she
could
without
a
mirror
do
you
think

still
there
i
shall
stop
here
till
he
marches
off
i
go

said
ingred
she
came
back
with
the
bad
news
that
not
only
was
the
stranger
still
there
but
he
was
actually
in
close
and
apparently
familiar
conversation
with
athelstane
and
hereward
who
were
calling
loudly
for
their
sisters
and
to
confirm
her
words
came
distant
jodellings
of
ingred
queenie
where

you
girls
there
was
nothing
for
it

to
come
forth
from

retreat
it
was
impossible

nonchalantly
as

and
her

it
seemed
a
more
and
superior
attitude
to
adopt

thought
his
eyes
twinkled
but
she
preserved
such
an
air
of
dignity
that
he
promptly
suppressed
any
undue
inclinations
towards
mirth

stood
looking

along
the
entrance
into
the
mound
was
through
a
low
doorway
with
lintel
and
posts
of
unhewn
stone
inside
was
a
kind
of
central
hall
with
three
chambers
leading
out
of
it
a
pile
of
rough
stones
in
front
seemed
to
point
to
further
chambers
that
part
never
been
explored

said
broughten
some
of
us
want
to
tackle
it
some
day
if
we
can
get
permission

it
a
big
job
you
do
want
to
bring

barrow
down
on
your
head
and
be
buried
in
the
ruins
i
never
think
the
roof
looks
too
secure
he
added
easily
poking
at
the
stones
above
with
his
stick
the
girls
aghast
at
the
notion
of
a
possible
subsidence
made
a
hasty
exit
to
the
open
air
and
hovered
near
the
entrance
in
much
agitation
of
mind
till
the
rest
of
the
party
made
a
safe
reappearance
their
conductor
with
a
side
glance
at
the
bunch
of
flowers
which
quenrede
ignored
made
some
reference
to
the
giant
king
stone
and
his
whispering
companions
he
was
evidently
well
versed
in
all
old
traditions
though
he
refrained
from
mentioning
local
practices
he
walked
part
of
the
way
home
with

said
ingred
to
quenrede
that
night
as
the
latter
sat
wielding
her
hairbrush
at
bedtime
and
you
need
be
afraid
anybody
would
mistake
you
for
a

in

chapter
xi
on
strike
it
was
about
this
time
that
a
general
spirit
of
trouble
and
dissatisfaction
seemed
to
creep
into
the
school
how
and
where
it
started
nobody
knew
any
more
than
one
can
trace
the
origin
of
influenza
germs
there
is
no
epidemic
more
catching
than
grumbling
however
and
the
complaint
spread
rapidly
it
had
the
unfortunate
effect
of
reacting
upon
itself
the
fact
that
the
girls
were
restive
made
the
teachers
more
strict
and
that
in
its
turn
produced
fresh
complaints
miss
burd
careful
for
the
cause
of
discipline
made
a
new
rule
that
any
form
showing
a
record
of
a
single
cross
for
conduct
would
be
debarred
for
a
week
from
the
use
of
the
asphalt
a
decidedly
drastic
measure
but
one
that
in
her
opinion
was
necessary
to
meet
the
emergency
though
the
disorder
was
mostly
among
the
juniors
va
was
not
altogether
immune
from
the
microbe
it
really
began
with
a
quarrel
between
ingred
and
beatrice
jackson
the
latter
was
a
type
of
girl
common
enough
in
all
large
schools
she
was
not
always
scrupulously
honorable
over
her
work
but
she
liked
to
curry
favor
with
the
mistresses
she
copied
her
exercises
shamelessly
would
surreptitiously
look
up
words
in
the
midst
of
unseen
latin
translation
and
was
capable
not
only
of
other
meannesses
but
sometimes
of
a
downright
deliberate
fib
she
and
ingred
were
at
such
opposite
poles
that
they
did
not
harmonize
well
together
in
the
old
days
with
visions
of
parties
at
rotherwood
beatrice
had
at
least
been
civil
but
now
that
there
seemed
no
further
prospect
of
being
asked
to
pleasant
entertainments
she
had
turned
round
and
treated
ingred
with
scant
politeness
in
general
and
sometimes
with
deliberate
rudeness
little
things
that
perhaps
we
laugh
at
afterwards
hurt
very
much
at
the
time
and
ingred
was
passing
through
an
ultra
sensitive
phase
during
the
latter
part
of
that
autumn
term
she
detested
beatrice
one
day
miss
burd
announced
that
on
the
following
saturday
there
was
to
be
a
match
played
in
a
suburb
of
grovebury
between
two
ladies
hockey
clubs
she
suggested
that
it
might
be
of
advantage
to
some
of
the
girls
to
go
and
watch
it
and
proposed
that
each
of
the
upper
forms
should
elect
one
of
their
number
as
special
reporter
to
write
an
account
of
the
match
which
could
be
read
aloud
afterwards
in
school
the
idea
rather
struck
them
it
finbury
wanderers
hilton
said
linda
slater
and
they
both
jolly
good
i
know
wish
i
could
have
gone
myself
but
booked
already
for
saturday
heaps
of
us
are
said
cicely
denham
we
like
to
hear
about
it
though
added
kitty
saunders
i
call
it
rather
a
brain
wave
to
choose
a
reporter
hands
up
any
girls
who
are
free
on
saturday
called
beatrice
jackson
the
announcement
had
been
made
rather
late
so
most
of
the
form
already
had
engagements
for
the
holiday
only
six
hands
were
raised
belonging
respectively
to
ingred
saxon
avie
irving
avis
marlowe
francie
hall
bess
haselford
and
beatrice
jackson
herself
a
poor
muster
for
va
remarked
kitty
as
ingred
our
warden
i
should
think
she
better
write
the
report
the
finbury
ground
is
a
horribly
awkward
place
to
get
to
put
in
beatrice
i
suppose
you
motor
there
ingred
we
have
no
car
now
confessed
ingred
turning
very
red
for
she
was
sure
that
beatrice
knew
that
fact
only
too
well
and
had
brought
it
into
prominence
on
purpose
to
humiliate
her
oh
i
suppose
you
be
motoring
bess
could
you
give
some
of
us
a
lift
i
believe
i
could
take
you
all
replied
bess
pleasantly
of
course
i
shall
have
to
ask
dad
first
if
i
may
have
the
car
out
on
saturday
but
i
do
expect
he
say
no
oh
what
sport
we
come
you
bet
look
here
i
beg
to
propose
that
bess
haselford
writes
the
report
of
the
match
and
i
second
it
declared
francie
hands
up
girls
bess
shall
be
for
this
show
half
the
girls
in
the
room
had
not
heard
kitty
proposal
that
ingred
should
be
chosen
and
some
of
the
others
listening
imperfectly
had
gathered
that
she
was
not
able
to
go
to
the
match
so
without
giving
her
a
further
thought
they
raised
hands
in
favor
of
bess
and
the
matter
was
carried
but
indeed
i
no
good
at
writing
or
describing
things
protested
bess
yes
you
are
you
got
to
try
so
there
cried
her
friends
triumphantly
you
do
it
just
as
well
as
anybody
else
would
ingred
turned
away
with
a
spot
raging
under
her
blouse
that
she
the
warden
of
the
form
should
have
been
passed
over
in
favor
of
a
girl
whose
sole
qualification
seemed
to
be
that
she
could
offer
some
of
the
others
a
lift
in
her
car
was
a
very
nasty
knock
was
bess
to
supplant
her
in
everything
perhaps
you
like
to
make
her
warden
instead
of
me
she
remarked
bitterly
to
belle
charlton
who
stood
near
i
perfectly
willing
to
resign
if
you
tired
of
me
belle
only
giggled
and
poked
joanna
powers
who
said
do
be
nasty
ingred
bess
is
a
sport
and
we
most
of
us
like
her
i
ca
see
the
attraction
myself
snapped
ingred
she
did
not
want
to
go
to
the
hockey
match
now
and
made
up
her
mind
obstinately
that
nothing
in
this
wide
world
should
decoy
her
to
it
bess
came
to
school
next
morning
armed
with
full
permission
to
use
her
father
car
and
to
invite
as
many
of
her
schoolfellows
as
it
would
accommodate
she
cordially
pressed
ingred
to
join
the
party
i
not
going
to
the
match
thanks
replied
the
latter
frigidly
but
there
heaps
of
room
there
is
indeed
without
a
frightful
squash
there
something
i
want
to
do
at
home
on
saturday
could
you
do
it
in
the
morning
the
form
will
be
disappointed
if
you
do
go
and
i
say
shyly
i
wish
you
write
that
wretched
report
instead
of
me
i
hate
the
idea
of
doing
it
the
form
wo
care
twopence
whether
i
go
or
stay
away
and
as
chosen
you
to
write
the
report
you
have
to
write
it
or
it
be
left
undone
retorted
ingred
perversely
bess
looking
decidedly
hurt
turned
away
her
little
efforts
at
friendship
with
ingred
were
invariably
met
in
this
most
ungracious
fashion
she
could
not
understand
why
her
advances
should
always
be
so
systematically
repulsed
ingred
on
her
part
stalked
off
with
the
mean
feeling
of
one
who
at
bottom
knows
she
is
in
the
wrong
but
wo
acknowledge
it
even
to
herself
under
the
of
indignation
she
realized
that
she
would
have
liked
bess
immensely
if
only
the
latter
had
not
taken
up
her
residence
at
rotherwood
that
however
was
an
offense
which
she
deemed
it
quite
impossible
ever
to
forgive
ingred
went
about
her
work
that
morning
in
a
very
scratchy
mood
so
much
so
as
to
attract
the
attention
of
miss
strong
who
possibly
felt
a
little
prickly
herself
since
even
teachers
have
their
phases
of
temper
it
was
at
that
time
a
fashion
in
the
form
for
the
girls
to
keep
all
sorts
of
absurd
mascots
inside
their
desks
the
collecting
and
comparison
of
which
afforded
them
huge
satisfaction
now
miss
strong
happened
to
be
lecturing
on
the
age
of
elizabeth
a
subject
so
congenial
to
her
that
she
was
generally
most
interesting
but
she
had
reached
a
rather
dry
and
arid
portion
of
that
famous
reign
and
even
her
powers
of
description
failed
for
once
and
the
lesson
became
a
mere
catalogue
of
events
and
dates
ingred
bored
stiff
with
listening
secretly
opened
her
desk
and
taking
a
selection
of
treasures
from
it
began
to
fondle
them
surreptitiously
upon
her
lap
it
was
of
course
a
quite
illegal
thing
to
do
she
glanced
at
them
occasionally
but
for
the
most
part
kept
her
eyes
upon
her
teacher
beatrice
however
who
sat
near
and
had
an
excellent
view
of
ingred
lap
gazed
at
it
with
such
persistent
and
marked
attention
that
she
attracted
the
notice
of
miss
strong
who
followed
the
direction
of
her
looks
and
pounced
upon
the
offender
ingred
saxon
what
have
you
there
bring
those
things
to
me
immediately
and
put
them
on
my
desk
with
a
crimson
face
ingred
obeyed
and
handed
over
into
the
custody
a
black
velvet
cat
a
small
golliwog
a
piece
of
clover
a
stone
with
a
hole
in
it
an
ivory
pig
miss
strong
smiled
cynically
at
fifteen
years
of
age
she
remarked
i
should
have
thought
a
girl
would
have
advanced
a
little
further
than
playthings
of
this
description
the
kindergarten
would
evidently
be
a
more
fit
form
for
you
than
va
you
lose
five
order
marks
five
order
marks
ingred
gasped
with
amazed
indignation
one
at
a
time
was
the
usual
forfeit
but
to
lose
five
at
one
fell
swoop
seemed
excessive
and
would
make
a
considerable
difference
to
her
weekly
record
she
blazed
against
the
injustice
no
girl
in
the
form
had
ever
had
so
severe
punishment
oh
miss
strong
she
protested
hotly
i
have
really
done
anything
more
than
heaps
of
the
others
it
not
fair
now
if
ingred
had
really
hoped
to
get
her
sentence
remitted
she
could
not
have
done
a
more
absolutely
suicidal
thing
a
mistress
may
overlook
some
faults
but
she
will
not
stand
cheek
the
discipline
of
the
form
was
at
stake
and
miss
strong
was
not
a
mistress
to
be
trifled
with
her
little
figure
absolutely
quivered
with
dignity
and
though
physically
she
was
shorter
than
her
pupil
morally
she
seemed
to
tower
yards
she
fixed
her
clear
dark
eyes
in
a
kind
of
hypnotic
stare
on
ingred
and
remarked
witheringly
that
will
do
i
do
allow
girl
to
speak
to
me
in
this
fashion
you
take
a
cross
for
conduct
as
well
as
losing
the
five
order
marks
you
may
go
to
your
seat
now
ingred
walked
back
to
her
desk
covered
with
humiliation
to
be
publicly
rebuked
before
the
whole
form
was
an
unpleasant
experience
particularly
for
a
warden
beatrice
francie
and
several
others
were
holding
up
noses
though
their
desks
contained
an
equal
assortment
of
mascots
ingred
still
seething
made
little
attempt
to
listen
to
the
rest
of
the
lecture
and
was
obliged
to
pass
the
questions
which
came
to
her
afterwards
on
the
she
was
heartily
thankful
when
eleven
brought
the
brief
ten
minutes
break
well
you
been
a
lunatic
this
morning
said
beatrice
passing
her
biscuits
in
hand
in
the
what
possessed
you
to
go
and
lose
the
for
the
form
if
you
had
stared
so
hard
at
me
miss
strong
would
never
have
noticed
oh
of
course
throw
the
blame
on
somebody
else
you
always
the
white
hen
that
never
lays
astray
kitty
and
evie
and
belle
and
i
had
arranged
a
set
grumbled
cicely
denham
it
most
unfair
this
rule
of
punishing
the
whole
form
for
what
one
girl
does
go
and
tell
miss
burd
so
then
flared
ingred
it
has
been
very
successful
so
far
to
tell
teachers
they
not
fair
but
you
may
have
better
luck
than
i
had
she
probably
say
yes
cicely
dear
rearrange
the
rules
at
once
so
like
her
is
it
now
you
sark
almost
as
sarky
as
the
snark
herself
commented
cicely
as
ingred
choking
over
a
last
biscuit
stumped
away
there
is
much
written
nowadays
about
the
unconscious
power
of
thought
waves
and
certainly
one
grumbler
can
often
spread
dissatisfaction
through
an
entire
community
perhaps
the
black
looks
which
ingred
encountered
from
the
disappointed
in
her
form
turned
into
naughty
sprites
who
whispered
treason
in
the
ears
of
the
juniors
or
perhaps
it
was
a
mere
coincidence
that
mutiny
suddenly
broke
out
in
the
lower
school
it
began
with
a
company
of
who
with
pencil
boxes
and
drawing
books
were
being
escorted
by
althea
riley
one
of
the
prefects
along
the
corridor
to
the
studio
hitherto
by
dint
of
judicious
curbing
they
had
always
walked
two
and
two
in
decent
line
and
had
refrained
from
prohibited
conversation
they
surged
upstairs
in
an
unseemly
rabble
chattering
and
talking
like
a
flock
of
rooks
or
jackdaws
at
sunset
it
was
in
vain
that
althea
tried
to
restore
order
her
efforts
at
discipline
were
simply
scouted
by
the
unruly
mob
who
rushed
into
the
studio
took
their
places
anyhow
and
only
controlled
themselves
at
the
entrance
of
miss
godwin
the
art
mistress
althea
flushed
indignant
and
most
upset
sought
her
shall
i
go
and
complain
to
miss
burd
she
asked
um
i
do
think
i
should
yet
said
lispeth
a
little
doubtfully
you
see
miss
burd
has
given
us
authority
and
she
likes
us
to
use
it
ourselves
as
much
as
we
can
without
appealing
to
her
of
course
in
any
extremity
she
support
us
i
pin
up
a
notice
in
the
junior
and
see
what
effect
that
has
it
may
settle
them
lispeth
stayed
after
four
until
the
last
coat
and
hat
had
disappeared
from
the
hooks
in
the
juniors
then
she
pinned
her
ultimatum
on
their
notice
board
in
consequence
of
the
extremely
bad
behavior
of
certain
girls
on
the
stairs
this
afternoon
the
prefects
give
notice
that
should
any
repetition
of
such
conduct
occur
the
names
of
the
offenders
will
be
taken
and
they
will
be
reported
to
miss
burd
for
punishment
that
ought
to
finish
those
kids
she
thought
as
she
pushed
in
the
there
was
more
than
the
usual
amount
of
buzzing
conversation
next
morning
as
juvenile
heads
bumped
each
other
in
their
efforts
to
read
the
notice
the
result
however
was
absolutely
unprecedented
in
the
annals
of
the
school
it
was
the
custom
of
the
sixth
form
and
of
many
of
the
fifth
to
take
their
lunch
and
eat
it
quietly
in
the
gymnasium
there
was
no
hard
and
fast
rule
about
this
but
it
was
generally
understood
to
be
a
privilege
of
the
upper
forms
only
and
intermediates
and
juniors
were
not
supposed
to
intrude
most
of
the
elder
girls
were
sitting
in
clumps
at
the
far
end
of
the
gymnasium
when
through
the
open
door
marched
a
most
amazing
procession
of
juniors
they
were
headed
by
phyllis
smith
and
dorrie
barnes
carrying
between
them
a
small
blackboard
upon
which
was
chalked
down
with
prefects
rights
for
juniors
the
whole
school
is
equal
after
these
ringleaders
marched
a
determined
crowd
waving
flags
made
of
handkerchiefs
fastened
to
the
end
of
rulers
a
band
equipped
with
combs
covered
with
torn
from
their
played
the
strains
of
the
marseillaise
they
advanced
towards
the
seniors
in
a
very
truculent
fashion
well
really
exclaimed
lispeth
recovering
from
her
momentary
amazement
what
the
meaning
of
all
this
i
like
to
know
it
a
strike
said
dorrie
proudly
as
she
and
phyllis
paused
so
as
to
display
the
blackboard
before
the
eyes
of
the
sixth
we
do
see
why
you
big
girls
should
lord
it
over
us
any
longer
we
obey
the
mistresses
but
we
not
obey
prefects
you
just
jolly
well
do
as
you
told
you
impudent
young
monkeys
declared
lispeth
losing
her
temper
here
clear
out
of
this
gymnasium
at
once
we
sha
we
as
good
a
right
here
as
you
we
ought
to
send
wardens
to
the
school
parliament
we
have
any
voice
in
school
affairs
it
not
fair
we
sha
stand
it
any
longer
the
shrill
voices
of
the
insurgents
reached
crescendo
as
they
hurled
forth
their
defiance
they
were
evidently
bent
on
revolution
lispeth
rose
to
read
the
riot
act
if
you
do
take
yourselves
off
i
shall
go
for
miss
burd
and
a
nice
row
you
get
into
then
i
give
you
while
i
count
ten
one
two
three
four
whether
the
strikers
would
have
stood
their
ground
or
not
is
still
an
unsolved
problem
but
at
that
opportune
moment
the
big
school
bell
began
to
clang
and
miss
willough
the
drill
mistress
in
her
blue
tunic
entered
the
gymnasium
ready
to
take
her
next
class
at
sight
of
her
dorrie
hastily
wiped
the
blackboard
and
the
juniors
fled
to
their
own
suppressing
flags
and
musical
instruments
on
the
way
miss
willough
gazed
at
them
meditatively
but
made
no
comment
and
the
sixth
hurrying
to
a
literature
lesson
had
no
time
to
offer
explanations
lispeth
more
upset
than
she
cared
to
own
talked
the
matter
over
with
her
mother
when
she
went
to
dinner
at
one
she
was
a
very
conscientious
girl
and
anxious
to
do
her
duty
as
head
as
a
result
of
the
home
conference
she
went
to
miss
burd
explained
the
situation
and
asked
to
be
allowed
to
have
the
whole
school
together
for
ten
minutes
before
four
it
only
lately
there
been
this
trouble
she
said
i
believe
if
i
talk
nicely
to
the
girls
i
can
get
back
my
influence
that
what
mother
advised
she
said
persuasion
first
she
right
too
agreed
miss
burd
if
you
can
get
them
to
obey
you
willingly
it
far
better
than
if
i
have
to
step
in
and
put
my
foot
down
what
we
want
is
to
change
the
general
current
of
thought
speculation
was
rife
in
the
various
forms
as
the
closing
bell
rang
at
instead
of
at
and
the
girls
were
told
to
assemble
in
the
lecture
hall
and
were
put
on
their
honor
to
behave
themselves
to
their
surprise
the
mistresses
after
seeing
them
seated
left
the
room
miss
burd
mounted
the
platform
and
announced
lispeth
scott
wishes
to
speak
to
you
all
and
i
should
like
you
to
know
that
anything
she
has
to
say
is
said
with
my
entire
approval
and
sanction
i
hope
you
will
listen
to
her
in
perfect
silence
then
she
followed
the
other
mistresses
all
eyes
were
fixed
on
lispeth
as
she
ascended
the
platform
with
her
tall
ample
figure
earnest
blue
eyes
light
hair
and
fair
face
flushed
with
the
excitement
of
her
task
she
looked
a
typical
english
girl
and
made
what
she
hoped
was
a
typical
english
speech
i
asked
you
to
come
she
began
rather
shyly
because
i
think
lately
there
have
been
some
misunderstandings
in
the
school
and
i
want
if
possible
to
put
them
straight
there
has
been
a
good
deal
of
talk
about
and
some
of
you
say
there
ought
to
be
prefects
i
wonder
exactly
what
you
mean
by
certainly
all
girls
are
born
with
equal
talents
yet
each
separate
soul
is
of
value
to
the
community
and
must
not
go
to
waste
the
test
of
a
school
is
not
how
many
show
pupils
it
has
turned
out
but
how
its
pupils
are
prepared
to
face
the
world
i
think
we
can
only
do
this
by
sticking
together
and
trying
to
help
each
other
in
every
community
however
there
must
be
leaders
an
army
would
soon
go
to
pieces
without
its
officers
the
prefects
and
wardens
have
been
chosen
as
leaders
and
it
ought
to
be
a
point
of
honor
with
you
to
uphold
their
authority
i
assure
you
they
do
work
for
their
own
good
but
for
the
good
of
the
school
i
hear
it
is
a
grievance
with
the
juniors
that
they
may
elect
wardens
for
the
council
well
they
shall
do
that
when
they
older
it
will
be
something
for
them
to
look
forward
to
there
a
privilege
though
that
we
can
and
will
give
them
we
going
to
start
a
junior
branch
of
the
rainbow
league
and
i
think
when
they
doing
their
level
best
to
help
others
they
forget
about
themselves
carlyle
says
that
the
very
dullest
drudge
has
the
elements
of
a
hero
in
him
if
he
once
sees
the
chance
of
aiming
at
something
higher
than
happiness
please
do
say
preaching
for
i
hate
to
be
a
prig
only
we
all
made
up
our
minds
to
do
our
in
the
war
work
and
it
seems
such
a
pity
if
we
forget
and
let
the
tone
of
the
school
drop
as
it
certainly
dropped
lately
i
sure
if
we
all
think
about
it
we
can
keep
it
up
and
seniors
and
juniors
can
work
together
without
any
horrid
squabbles
we
big
girls
were
juniors
ourselves
once
and
you
little
ones
will
be
seniors
some
day
so
that
one
way
of
looking
at
it
now
that
all
i
got
to
say
except
that
any
juniors
who
like
can
stay
behind
now
and
join
the
junior
branch
of
the
rainbow
league
we
want
to
get
up
a
special
union
and
miss
burd
says
she
give
a
prize
for
the
best
and
also
for
the
best
doll
she
going
to
have
an
exhibition
on
day
chapter
xii
the
rainbow
league
though
lispeth
in
her
agitation
had
not
said
half
the
nice
things
she
had
intended
to
say
her
little
speech
had
good
effect
it
reminded
the
girls
of
some
of
the
high
ideals
with
which
they
had
started
the
term
and
which
like
many
high
and
beautiful
things
were
in
danger
of
getting
crowded
out
of
the
way
by
commoner
interests
everybody
suddenly
remembered
the
exhibition
and
sale
which
was
to
come
off
before
christmas
and
made
a
spurt
to
send
some
adequate
contribution
the
juniors
flattered
at
having
a
special
branch
of
their
own
of
the
rainbow
league
and
time
allotted
in
school
to
its
work
dabbed
away
blissfully
at
making
with
gummy
overalls
and
seccotiny
fingers
but
complacent
faces
the
prefects
with
intent
dropped
in
when
possible
to
admire
the
efforts
i
believe
said
lispeth
to
her
special
confidante
althea
that
perhaps
we
were
making
rather
a
mistake
you
ca
have
any
influence
with
those
kids
unless
you
keep
well
in
touch
with
them
i
was
so
busy
i
just
let
them
slide
before
and
i
suppose
that
was
partly
why
they
got
out
of
hand
though
the
little
monkeys
had
no
business
to
get
up
that
impudent
strike
they
as
different
as
possible
now
and
some
of
them
are
quite
decent
kiddies
dorrie
barnes
brought
me
a
rose
this
morning
i
suppose
it
was
meant
as
a
sort
of
it
was
arranged
to
hold
what
was
called
the
rainbow
fÃªte
on
afternoon
and
parents
and
friends
were
invited
to
the
ceremony
there
was
to
be
both
a
sale
and
an
exhibition
the
best
of
the
toys
and
little
fancy
articles
were
to
be
at
a
special
stall
and
would
be
sold
for
the
benefit
of
the
war
orphans
fund
and
those
that
were
not
quite
up
to
standard
would
nevertheless
be
on
view
and
would
be
sent
away
afterwards
to
help
to
deck
christmas
trees
in
the
slums
stall
as
the
girls
called
it
was
of
course
the
center
of
attraction
it
was
draped
with
colored
muslins
in
the
rainbow
tints
and
though
real
irises
were
unobtainable
some
vases
of
artificial
ones
formed
a
very
good
substitute
the
toys
were
really
most
creditable
to
the
and
had
been
ingeniously
contrived
with
bobbins
small
boxes
and
slight
additions
of
wood
cardboard
and
paper
aided
by
the
windmills
whirligigs
carts
engines
trains
house
furniture
jigsaw
puzzles
cardboard
animals
with
movable
limbs
black
velveteen
cats
with
bead
eyes
beautifully
dressed
rag
dolls
wool
balls
and
rattles
for
babies
and
dear
little
books
of
extracts
were
some
of
the
things
set
out
in
a
tempting
display
fil
whose
slim
fingers
excelled
in
dainty
work
had
contributed
three
charming
booklets
of
poetry
and
nice
bits
cut
from
magazines
and
newspapers
the
back
being
of
colored
linen
embroidered
with
devices
in
silk
they
were
so
pretty
that
they
were
all
snapped
up
beforehand
and
could
have
been
sold
three
times
over
you
promised
one
to
me
you
know
you
did
urged
linda
slater
much
aggrieved
at
the
of
an
order
well
i
thought
i
have
time
to
do
four
and
could
only
manage
three
apologized
fil
you
see
they
really
take
such
ages
and
miss
strong
was
getting
raggy
about
my
prep
you
make
me
one
for
my
birthday
begged
evie
certainly
not
those
that
ask
sha
have
well
could
you
do
some
during
the
christmas
holidays
no
i
ca
and
sha
snapped
fil
i
sick
to
death
of
making
booklets
and
i
not
going
to
touch
one
of
them
during
the
holidays
you
seem
to
think
i
nothing
else
to
do
except
cut
bits
out
of
magazines
for
your
benefit
there
there
poor
old
sport
do
get
baity
you
should
do
them
so
jolly
well
and
then
you
would
get
asked
stall
occupied
a
position
of
importance
at
the
end
of
the
lecture
hall
and
the
rest
of
the
exhibits
were
put
round
on
trestle
tables
they
were
what
ingred
described
as
a
mixed
lot
some
of
the
animals
were
bulgy
in
their
proportions
or
shaky
in
their
cardboard
limbs
the
wheels
of
the
carts
did
not
quite
correspond
the
windmills
were
apt
to
stick
or
the
puzzles
would
not
quite
fit
in
spite
of
their
imperfections
however
they
looked
attractive
and
would
no
doubt
give
great
pleasure
to
the
little
people
who
were
to
receive
them
and
who
were
hardly
likely
to
be
very
critical
of
their
workmanship
to
make
the
afternoon
more
festive
there
was
to
be
a
tea
stall
to
which
the
girls
brought
contributions
of
cakes
and
music
was
to
be
given
from
the
platform
so
that
the
scene
might
resemble
a
cafÃ©
chantant
ingred
had
been
chosen
as
one
of
the
artistes
and
arrayed
in
her
best
brown
velveteen
dress
with
a
new
hair
ribbon
she
waited
about
in
her
usual
agonies
of
stage
fright
learning
from
linton
however
improving
it
might
be
to
her
touch
was
hardly
conducive
to
and
after
having
suffered
much
vituperation
for
her
imperfect
rendering
of
a
piece
it
was
decidedly
appalling
to
have
to
play
it
in
public
especially
with
the
horrible
possibility
that
at
any
moment
her
master
might
happen
to
pop
in
to
view
the
exhibition
and
arrive
in
time
for
her
performance
i
shall
have
forty
fits
if
i
see
him
in
the
room
i
know
i
shall
she
confided
to
fil
you
no
idea
how
he
scares
me
i
have
my
lessons
on
the
study
piano
generally
and
if
only
he
would
sit
still
i
mind
but
he
get
up
and
prowl
about
the
room
and
swing
out
his
arms
when
he
explaining
things
he
only
missed
knocking
over
that
pretty
statuette
of
venus
the
other
day
i
sure
if
miss
burd
knew
how
he
flourishes
about
she
would
let
him
loose
among
her
cherished
ornaments
perhaps
he
wo
turn
up
oh
yes
he
said
he
should
make
a
point
of
buying
a
toy
for
his
little
boy
if
i
break
down
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
my
piece
you
know
the
reason
i
shaking
now
poor
old
sport
do
take
it
so
hard
by
three
the
lecture
hall
was
filled
with
what
lilias
ashby
who
had
undertaken
to
write
a
report
for
the
school
magazine
described
as
a
distinguished
crowd
fathers
indeed
were
as
few
and
far
between
as
currants
in
a
war
pudding
but
mothers
aunts
and
sisters
had
responded
nobly
to
the
invitations
and
were
being
conducted
round
by
the
girls
to
see
their
special
exhibits
saxon
had
been
unable
to
come
that
afternoon
but
quenrede
had
turned
up
looking
very
pretty
in
a
hat
and
giving
herself
slight
airs
as
of
one
who
is
now
a
finished
young
lady
and
no
longer
a
mere
schoolgirl
she
chatted
in
rather
mincing
tones
to
miss
burd
herself
while
ingred
stood
by
in
awe
and
amazement
and
when
she
bought
a
cup
of
tea
from
doreen
hayward
at
the
refreshment
stall
she
murmured
oh
thanks
much
with
the
manner
of
a
patroness
though
only
six
months
ago
she
and
doreen
had
sat
side
by
side
in
the
science
lectures
it
was
a
new
phase
of
quenrede
which
though
accepted
to
some
extent
at
home
had
never
shown
itself
before
with
quite
such
aggravated
symptoms
ingred
walking
as
it
were
in
her
shadow
was
not
sure
whether
to
admire
or
laugh
it
was
of
course
something
to
have
such
a
pretty
and
decidedly
stylish
sister
she
appreciated
the
angle
at
which
the
hat
was
set
and
the
that
made
the
tiny
iced
bun
last
such
an
enormous
time
when
a
schoolgirl
would
have
finished
it
in
three
bites
and
have
taken
another
a
grand
manner
was
certainly
rather
an
asset
to
the
family
and
queenie
was
palpably
impressing
some
of
the
intermediates
who
poked
each
other
to
look
at
her
it
my
turn
to
play
soon
and
i
just
shivering
whispered
ingred
nonsense
child
do
be
such
a
little
goose
declared
her
sister
airily
it
only
a
school
party
there
really
nothing
to
make
a
fuss
about
a
school
party
that
seemed
to
ingred
the
absolute
limit
quenrede
last
term
had
in
her
turn
shivered
and
trembled
when
she
had
been
obliged
to
mount
the
platform
could
a
few
short
months
have
indeed
effected
so
magnificent
a
change
of
front
all
the
same
it
i
who
got
to
play
not
she
it
easy
enough
to
tell
somebody
else
not
to
mind
thought
ingred
as
in
answer
to
miss
clough
beckoning
finger
she
made
her
way
towards
the
piano
to
undergo
her
ordeal
one
point
in
favor
of
the
recital
was
that
the
audience
moved
about
the
room
and
went
on
buying
toys
or
cups
of
tea
and
cakes
and
even
talking
instead
of
sitting
on
rows
of
seats
doing
nothing
but
watching
and
listening
it
was
rather
comforting
to
think
that
the
concert
was
really
only
like
the
performance
of
a
band
a
soothing
accompaniment
to
conversation
ingred
opened
her
music
with
an
almost
do
care
feeling
for
one
delirious
moment
she
felt
at
her
ease
then
alack
her
mood
suddenly
changed
in
a
last
lightning
glance
towards
the
audience
she
noticed
among
the
crowd
near
the
the
tall
thin
figure
cadaverous
face
and
long
lank
hair
of
linton
the
sight
instantly
wrecked
her
world
of
composure
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
fact
that
miss
clough
was
standing
near
and
nodding
to
her
to
begin
she
would
have
run
away
from
the
platform
oh
the
ill
luck
of
it
she
thought
if
i
had
only
played
last
time
instead
of
gertie
i
have
had
it
over
before
he
came
into
the
room
i
know
he
be
just
listening
to
every
note
and
criticizing
with
a
horrid
feeling
as
if
her
breath
would
not
come
properly
and
her
head
was
slightly
spinning
and
her
hands
dithering
ingred
began
her
nocturne
trying
with
a
sort
of
drowning
effort
to
keep
her
mind
on
the
music
in
front
of
her
instead
of
on
the
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
for
sixteen
bars
she
succeeded
then
came
the
hitch
she
had
rejected
the
offered
services
of
doris
grainger
and
had
elected
to
turn
over
her
own
pages
she
now
made
a
hasty
dash
at
the
leaf
her
trembling
hand
was
not
sufficiently
agile
the
sheet
slipped
she
grabbed
in
vain
and
the
music
fluttered
on
to
the
floor
the
performance
came
to
a
dead
halt
doris
and
miss
clough
rushed
to
the
rescue
but
they
were
put
politely
aside
by
a
tall
figure
who
stepped
on
to
the
platform
and
linton
himself
picked
up
the
scattered
sheets
of
the
unfortunate
nocturne
he
arranged
them
together
in
order
placed
them
upon
the
stand
and
addressing
his
dismayed
pupil
said
now
then
begin
again
and
shall
turn
over
for
you
bring
out
that
passage
properly
remember
there
a
pedal
on
the
piano
it
was
like
having
a
lesson
in
public
ingred
felt
too
scared
to
begin
and
yet
she
was
too
much
afraid
of
her
master
to
refuse
so
the
bigger
fright
prevailed
and
as
a
cat
will
swim
to
escape
an
enemy
she
dashed
at
the
nocturne
once
restarted
it
went
magnificently
afterwards
she
always
declared
that
linton
must
have
hypnotized
her
she
was
sure
her
unaided
efforts
could
never
have
rendered
it
in
such
style
he
behaved
as
if
he
were
conducting
an
orchestra
soothing
the
passages
and
spurring
her
on
to
efforts
even
humming
the
melody
in
his
eccentric
fashion
quite
unmindful
of
the
audience
the
enthusiastic
applause
at
the
end
was
so
evidently
for
both
master
and
pupil
that
he
bowed
instinctively
in
response
ingred
remembering
now
the
ordeal
was
over
that
she
was
nervous
melted
from
the
platform
and
left
him
to
receive
the
laurels
he
did
a
characteristic
but
very
kind
act
looked
round
for
his
pupil
and
then
perceiving
that
she
had
beaten
a
retreat
sat
down
to
the
piano
himself
and
unasked
gave
an
encore
for
her
a
solo
from
linton
was
an
unexpected
treat
especially
as
he
was
in
the
mood
for
music
and
played
with
a
sort
of
rapture
that
carried
his
listeners
into
an
ethereal
world
of
delicate
sounds
ingred
hidden
behind
a
protecting
barrier
of
schoolfellows
could
see
all
the
sylphs
dancing
and
the
fairy
pipers
piping
as
the
crisp
notes
came
tripping
from
his
practised
fingers
at
the
end
she
came
back
as
from
a
dream
to
realize
that
she
was
not
in
but
in
the
college
lecture
hall
and
that
she
was
sitting
on
a
form
next
to
miss
strong
who
held
on
her
knee
a
little
boy
with
linton
unmistakable
dark
eyes
in
that
instant
as
the
music
ceased
ingred
received
quite
a
sudden
and
new
impression
of
miss
strong
there
was
a
tender
look
on
the
face
as
she
held
her
arm
around
the
child
and
she
whispered
something
to
him
that
made
the
dark
eyes
dance
he
slipped
from
her
lap
and
hand
in
hand
they
went
together
towards
the
it
was
quite
a
pretty
little
scene
one
of
those
tiny
glimpses
into
other
people
lives
that
we
catch
occasionally
when
the
veil
of
their
reserve
is
for
a
moment
held
aside
ingred
looked
after
them
meditatively
should
have
thought
the
snark
capable
of
it
she
ruminated
perhaps
she
likes
boys
better
than
girls
some
people
do
the
toy
stall
though
half
depleted
of
its
contents
was
still
the
center
of
attraction
lispeth
and
althea
were
displaying
what
were
left
of
its
windmills
and
whirligigs
to
friends
who
bought
with
an
eye
to
christmas
presents
miss
strong
reckless
in
the
matter
of
expense
purchased
the
of
the
whole
collection
a
wonderful
contrivance
consisting
of
two
cardboard
towers
and
a
courtyard
across
which
by
means
of
a
tape
wound
round
bobbins
and
turned
by
a
handle
walked
a
miniature
procession
of
wooden
soldiers
little
kenneth
linton
received
it
with
open
arms
better
let
me
wrap
it
up
in
paper
urged
lispeth
somebody
said
just
now
that
it
beginning
to
snow
and
you
do
want
to
have
it
spoilt
before
you
get
it
home
do
you
said
kenneth
relinquishing
it
doubtfully
you
a
lucky
boy
continued
lispeth
as
she
made
up
the
parcel
is
that
a
teddy
bear
in
your
pocket
and
a
ball
too
there
i
believe
i
used
up
all
the
string
what
a
nuisance
can
anybody
get
me
any
from
anywhere
i
find
you
some
in
half
a
jiff
said
dorrie
barnes
whisking
off
immediately
since
the
formation
of
the
junior
rainbow
league
dorrie
had
taken
a
liking
to
lispeth
which
amounted
to
absolute
infatuation
she
followed
her
like
a
shadow
and
was
always
at
her
elbow
sometimes
at
convenient
and
sometimes
at
embarrassing
moments
she
fled
now
like
a
messenger
from
olympus
with
the
fixed
determination
of
procuring
string
for
her
goddess
from
somewhere
it
was
not
an
easy
task
for
string
was
a
scarce
commodity
what
there
was
of
it
had
mostly
been
already
used
and
what
was
left
was
jealously
guarded
by
its
proprietresses
who
refused
to
part
with
it
even
on
the
plea
that
it
was
for
the
head
prefect
dorrie
however
was
a
young
person
of
spirit
and
resource
and
she
did
not
mean
to
be
done
one
of
the
trestles
that
supported
the
secondary
exhibits
of
toys
had
rather
come
to
grief
and
had
been
patched
up
temporarily
with
stout
twine
her
sharp
eyes
had
noted
this
fact
so
going
down
on
her
hands
and
knees
she
managed
to
creep
unobserved
under
the
table
cut
the
twine
with
her
penknife
and
unwound
it
she
was
just
congratulating
herself
upon
the
success
of
her
achievement
when
the
unexpected
happened
or
rather
what
might
have
been
expected
by
any
one
with
an
ounce
of
forethought
the
damaged
trestle
no
longer
held
together
promptly
gave
way
and
the
table
collapsed
burying
a
squealing
dorrie
amid
a
shower
of
toys
she
was
pulled
out
agitated
but
uninjured
and
the
scattered
exhibits
were
carried
to
another
table
in
the
confusion
of
their
transit
she
managed
to
secrete
the
piece
of
twine
the
loss
of
which
had
been
the
cause
of
the
whole
upset
and
presented
it
quite
innocently
to
lispeth
who
not
knowing
that
she
was
receiving
stolen
goods
thanked
her
and
tied
the
parcel
ingred
who
had
watched
the
whole
comedy
laughed
but
did
not
give
away
the
secret
that
child
an
imp
she
said
to
quenrede
but
she
a
very
accomplished
imp
i
tell
you
the
joke
afterwards
not
now
lispeth
little
knows
where
her
string
comes
from
and
she
wrapping
up
that
parcel
so
placidly
is
the
snark
looking
quite
pretty
this
afternoon
never
saw
her
with
such
a
color
well
if
you
ready
queenie
go
over
to
the
hostel
and
get
my
things
we
can
just
catch
the
four
train
if
we
quick
wait
half
a
sec
though
there
goes
linton
with
kenneth
i
do
want
to
walk
out
under
his
wing
the
tall
dark
figure
of
the
music
master
was
striding
through
the
doorway
carrying
his
small
son
who
hugged
his
toy
with
one
arm
and
waved
a
friendly
with
the
other
what
possessed
you
to
drop
all
your
music
child
said
quenrede
rather
patronizingly
to
ingred
she
was
still
trying
to
live
up
to
the
hat
you
played
ever
so
decently
afterwards
though
you
did
really
do
tell
me
again
that
you
nervous
for
it
all
rubbish
you
looked
as
if
you
enjoyed
it
enjoyed
it
echoed
ingred
if
you
gone
through
the
palpitations
that
i
felt
this
afternoon
you
want
to
go
to
a
specialist
and
consult
him
for
heart
trouble
i
lived
through
it
this
once
but
if
i
ever
asked
to
play
again
in
public
you
better
go
to
the
cemetery
beforehand
and
choose
a
picturesque
corner
for
my
grave
and
buy
a
weeping
willow
ready
to
plant
upon
it
yes
and
order
a
headstone
too
with
the
simple
words
of
fright
i
mean
it
it
indeed
why
i
never
in
the
whole
of
my
life
been
in
such
an
absolutely
blue
funk
chapter
xiii
quenrede
comes
out
the
saxon
family
celebrated
christmas
at
the
bungalow
with
mixed
feelings
as
ingred
said
it
was
like
the
curate
egg
parts
of
it
were
very
nice
it
was
the
first
christmas
they
had
spent
all
together
for
many
years
and
if
they
could
only
have
forgotten
rotherwood
and
their
altered
circumstances
they
would
have
enjoyed
it
immensely
saxon
the
unfailing
of
the
household
tried
to
ignore
the
tone
of
discontent
in
her
husband
voice
the
grumpy
attitude
of
egbert
quenrede
fit
of
the
blues
and
athelstane
rather
martyred
pose
she
insisted
on
bundling
everybody
out
for
a
blow
on
the
moors
if
we
been
living
in
grovebury
she
remarked
we
should
probably
have
taken
a
jaunt
to
as
a
special
treat
let
us
think
ourselves
lucky
in
being
on
the
spot
and
only
having
to
turn
out
of
our
own
door
to
be
at
once
in
such
lovely
scenery
it
like
having
a
country
holiday
at
christmas
instead
of
midsummer
a
thing
i
always
hankered
after
and
never
got
before
certainly
winter
on
the
wold
held
a
charm
of
its
own
the
great
waste
of
brown
moor
stretching
under
the
gray
sky
showed
rich
patches
where
yellow
grass
and
rushes
edged
dark
boggy
pools
the
stems
of
sallows
and
alders
were
delicate
with
shades
of
orange
and
mauve
here
and
there
a
sprig
of
furze
lingered
in
flower
and
black
flights
of
starlings
and
fieldfares
driven
from
colder
climates
in
quest
of
food
swept
in
long
lines
across
the
horizon
the
weather
was
open
for
the
time
of
year
the
wind
strong
but
not
too
keen
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
lowness
of
the
sun
in
the
sky
the
day
might
have
been
autumn
instead
of
december
it
was
glorious
to
walk
to
the
top
of
wetherstone
heights
and
see
miles
away
the
spire
of
monkswell
church
and
the
gleam
of
the
distant
river
then
to
hurry
back
in
the
gloaming
with
the
rising
mists
creeping
up
like
advancing
specters
and
to
find
the
lamps
lighted
and
tea
ready
in
the
cheery
bungalow
nobody
wanted
to
quarrel
with
yule
cake
and
muffins
and
even
saxon
temporarily
forgot
his
worries
and
relapsed
into
quite
amusing
reminiscences
of
certain
adventures
in
france
if
only
our
spirits
would
keep
up
to
the
point
to
which
with
much
effort
we
screw
them
all
would
be
well
unfortunately
they
often
have
a
tiresome
knack
of
descending
with
a
run
when
tea
was
finished
and
cleared
away
saxon
found
the
presence
of
his
family
a
hindrance
to
reading
and
at
a
hint
from
their
mother
the
younger
members
of
the
party
took
themselves
off
into
the
little
here
round
a
black
fire
which
despite
hereward
poking
refused
to
burn
brightly
the
that
had
been
lowering
all
day
burst
at
last
if
we
only
got
the
rotherwood
billiard
table
there
be
something
to
do
groused
egbert
gloomily
there
is
a
corner
in
this
poky
hole
where
a
fellow
can
fiddle
with
photography
chimed
in
athelstane
even
if
there
was
time
to
do
it
when
i
get
back
from
birkshaw
it
nothing
but
grind
grind
grind
at
medical
books
all
the
evening
rather
have
your
job
than
mine
though
said
egbert
you
have
to
sit
under
the
pater
eye
all
day
long
and
have
him
down
on
you
like
a
cartload
of
bricks
if
you
make
the
slightest
slip
i
the
worst
off
of
the
whole
lot
of
us
what
about
me
at
that
odious
grammar
school
asked
hereward
pressing
his
claims
to
the
palm
of
dissatisfaction
or
me
at
the
hostel
urged
ingred
not
to
be
outdone
i
do
think
you
any
of
you
realize
how
slow
it
is
just
to
stop
at
home
sighed
quenrede
there
were
sixteen
dozen
things
i
made
up
my
mind
to
do
and
i
ca
do
one
of
them
it
going
to
be
a
hateful
new
year
for
all
of
us
just
a
new
year
of
going
without
and
scraping
and
saving
and
economizing
ugh
what
a
life
life
mostly
what
we
make
it
said
mother
who
had
quietly
joined
the
circle
after
all
what
we
think
we
want
does
always
give
the
greatest
happiness
suppose
each
of
us
tries
to
let
this
be
the
best
year
we
ever
had
very
little
in
the
way
of
material
wealth
may
come
to
us
but
the
other
kind
of
wealth
is
far
better
worth
working
for
i
think
this
hard
time
gives
us
the
chance
to
show
what
we
made
of
during
the
fighting
the
lads
at
the
front
went
steadily
through
severe
privations
and
the
women
at
home
worked
in
the
same
brave
cheery
fashion
now
the
strain
of
the
war
is
over
are
we
going
to
let
all
this
splendid
spirit
drop
suppose
we
fight
our
own
battles
as
we
fought
our
country
let
me
feel
i
still
got
a
family
of
soldiers
to
be
proud
of
you
the
colonel
then
of
the
new
corps
said
egbert
with
an
affectionate
to
the
slight
figure
that
was
already
making
the
black
fire
break
into
a
blaze
you
pluck
enough
for
the
whole
clan
little
mother
o
mine
you
shall
sound
your
slogan
and
lead
the
attack
on
fate
till
we
get
back
to
rotherwood
there
i
aiming
at
higher
things
than

said
his
mother
gravely

quenrede
squeezing
the
dear
hand
that
reached
out
and
clasped
her
own

wo
be
a
selfish
beast
any
more
i
indeed
economizing
shall
be
my
new

if
we
going
to

up

proclaimed
athelstane
humorously
the
orphan
fine
voice
while
i
studying

mine
but
probably
counts
it
her
choicest
blessing
exclaimed
ingred
and
then
the
whole
family
broke
out
laughing
and
mother
little
lecture
ended
in
fun
it
made
its
impression
upon
individual
members
all
the
same
the
six
miles
which
separated
the
saxons
from
grovebury
seemed
to
have
set
up
an
effectual
barrier
between
them
and
the
old
world
in
which
they
had
moved
before
many
people
who
had
been
friendly
in
the
rotherwood
days
did
not
trouble
to
come
so
far
as
to
pay
calls
and
the
numerous
invitations
which
had
formerly
been
extended
to
the
young
folks
decreased
this
christmas
to
very
few
first
and
foremost
amongst
these
scanty
festivities
came
dance
it
was
a
affair
and
she
had
sent
printed
invitations
to
egbert
athelstane
and
quenrede
the
latter
who
only
knew
the
desmonds
slightly
and
was
always
overwhelmed
in
their
presence
developed
a
sudden
and
acute
fit
of
shyness
and
implored
to
be
allowed
to
refuse
if
it
had
been
the
browns
or
lawrences
i
have
loved
it
she
urged
but
you
know
mumsie
how
desmond
absolutely
withers
me
up
i
never
can
say
six
words
when
she
there
i
run
five
miles
to
avoid
meeting
her
you
know
i
would
she
so
starchy
you
see
very
little
of
your
hostess
at
a
dance
do
be
silly
queenie
insisted
saxon
i
say
you
to
go
so
there
an
end
of
it
i
go
for
an
evening
martyrdom
then
not
for
enjoyment
wailed
her
daughter
dolefully
a
first
dance
is
often
a
terrible
ordeal
to
a
girl
of
eighteen
and
quenrede
though
she
had
put
on
a
few
airs
to
impress
the
schoolgirls
at
the
rainbow
league
sale
was
at
bottom
woefully
bashful
she
was
still
in
the
stage
when
her
hair
looked
as
if
it
were
unaccustomed
to
be
coiled
round
her
head
she
had
a
painful
habit
of
blushing
and
had
not
yet
acquired
that
general
which
comes
to
us
with
the
passing
of
our
teens
to
be
plunged
for
a
whole
evening
into
the
society
of
a
succession
of
strangers
seemed
to
her
anything
but
an
exhilarating
prospect
if
i
could
just
dance
with
our
own
boys
she
sighed
i
pity
you
if
you
did
declared

pausing
in
an
effort
to
make

worthy

half
the
fun

be

i
only
wish
i
your
chance
and
was
out
too
i
sure
you
welcome
to
go
instead
of
me
proclaimed
quenrede
petulantly
all
the
same
she
watched
the
preparations
for
the
event
with
considerable
girlish
interest
mother
whose
ambitions
at
first
had
run
to
a

from

decided
that
the

a
thrilling
experience
to
unaccustomed

sometimes
difficult
to
understand
seams

not
fit

standing
on
the

revolved
slowly
while
saxon
and

stuck
in
pins
and
debated
whether
a
quarter
of
an
inch
here
and
there
should
be
raised
or
lowered
ingred
showed
far
more
cleverness
in
sewing
than
her

natty

could
contrive
pretty

in
the
shape
of

quenrede
laughingly
assured
her

if

though
she
was
ready
with
a
joke
as
a
matter
of
fact
quenrede
was
having
a
severe
struggle
not
to
be
snappy
for
years
and
years
she
had
planned
her
coming
out
and
she
had
decided
upon
a
ball
at
rotherwood
and
an
absolute
creation
of
a
gown
that
was
to
be
sent
for
from
paris
there
would
have
been
some
Ã©clat
then
in
emerging
from
the
chrysalis
stage
of
the
and
becoming
a
butterfly
of
society
to
make
her
first
appearance
at
desmond
dance
and
in
a
dress
seemed
not
so
much
a
coming
out
as
an
oozing
out
there
are
degrees
in
butterflies
and
she
feared
her
appearance
would
resemble
not
the
gorgeous
red
admiral
or
painted
lady
but
the
common
white
cabbage
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
new
year
resolution
some
traces
of
her
disappointment
would
have
leaked
out
but
she
kept
the
secret
bravely
to
herself
the
family
indeed
knew
she
was
not
anxious
to
go
but
set
her
unwilling
attitude
down
to
mere
shyness
her
mother
never
guessed
at
the
real
reason
there
was
a
tremendous
robing
on
the
evening
of
january
the
ninth
with
mother
and
ingred
for

the
orphan
hovering
about
offering
to
bring
pins
or
hot
water
on
the
chance
of
getting
a
peep
at
the
proceedings
saxon
stepped
back
when
all
was
complete
and
viewed
the
result
somewhat
in
the
spirit
of
an
artist
who
has
finished
a
picture
it
is
an
event
in
a
mother
life
when
her
first
little
girl
grows
up
and
becomes
a
young
lady
quenrede
was
to
be
launched
on
the
stream
of
society
looked
at
critically
her
appearance
was
very
satisfactory
though
the
new
dress
might
not
be
up
to
the
level
of
a
it
certainly
became
her
and
set
off
the
pretty
fair
face
white
neck
and
coils
of
gleaming
flaxen
hair
your
gloves
and
shoes
and
stockings
are
all
right

handkerchief
and

handiwork
my

yourself
and

silly
and
shy
i
shall
keep
awake
till
you
come
back
ingred
assured
her
it
was
something
at
any
rate
to
be
going
with
egbert
and
athelstane
among
the
stream
of
strangers
there
would
be
at
least
two
home
objects
upon
which
she
might
occasionally
cast
anchor
the
thought
of
that
buoyed
her
up
as
the
taxi
whirled
them
down
hill
to
grovebury
the
desmonds
were
giving
the
dance
as
a
for
one
of
their
own
daughters
and
their
house
was
an
awning
protected
the
porch
red
cloth
carpeted
the
steps
a
marquee
filled
the
lawn
and
a
stringed
band
from
birkshaw
had
been
engaged
to
play
the
latest
dance
music
quenrede
passed
calmly
enough
through
the
ordeals
of
leaving
her
cloak
in
the
where
a
crowd
of
girls
were
prinking
and
there
was
no
room
for
even
a
glance
in
the
mirror
and
the
greeting
from
her
host
and
hostess
in
the
it
was
in
the
afterwards
that
her
agony
began
egbert
and
athelstane
were
whisked
away
from
her
to
be
introduced
to
other
girls
and
utter
strangers
whose
names
she
seldom
caught
were
brought
to
her
took
her
program
recorded
their
initials
and
passed
on
to
book
other
partners
the
few
people
in
the
marquee
whom
she
knew
were
too
far
away
or
too
occupied
to
speak
to
her
so
she
stood
alone
and
heartily
wished
herself
at
home
it
was
better
when
the
dancing
began
though
her
partners
scared
her
horribly
they
all
made
exactly
the
same
remarks
about
the
excellence
of
the
floor
the
taste
of
the
decorations
and
the
beauty
of
the
music
and
asked
her
if
she
had
been
to
the
pantomime
and
whether
she
played
golf
small
talk
is
an
art
and
though
quenrede
had
many
interests
and
in
ordinary
circumstances
could
have
discussed
them
she
felt
and
let
the
ball
of
conversation
drop
with
a
yes
or
no
or
very
dances
with
strangers
who
expected
her
to
talk
were
bad
enough
but
the
gaps
in
her
program
were
worse
no
doubt
desmond
tried
to
look
after
all
her
guests
but
several
gentlemen
had
disappointed
her
at
the
last
minute
and
there
were
not
quite
partners
enough
to
go
round
at
a
young
people
party
quenrede
would
have
cheerily
danced
with
some
other
girl
in
like
plight
but
at
this
stiff
gathering
she
dared
not
suggest
such
an
informality
and
remained
a
wallflower
she
caught
glimpses
occasionally
of
egbert
and
athelstane
the
former
apparently
enjoying
himself
the
latter
looking
as
solemn
as
if
he
were
in
church
i
know
the
poor
boy
counting
his
steps
and
trying
not
to
tread
on
anybody
toes
thought
quenrede
ingred
said
his
partners
would
have
to
pull
him
around
somehow
supper
was
a
diversion
for
she
was
taken
in
by
quite
a
nice
boy
a
little
younger
than
herself
who
after
a
manful
effort
to
talk
up
to
her
supposed
level
thankfully
relapsed
into
details
of
being
a
nephew
of
the
house
he
proved
an
adept
in
attracting
the
most
tempting
dishes
of
fruit
or
trifle
to
their
particular
table
and
even
basely
commandeered
other
people
crackers
for
her
benefit
she
bade
him
with
regret
i
say
i
wish
my
card
was
full
i
have
liked
a
dance
with
you
he
murmured
wistfully
as
they
left
the
if
only
she
had
known
people
better
and
the
atmosphere
had
not
seemed
so
stiff
and
formal
and
she
had
not
been
so
miserably
shy
quenrede
might
have
enjoyed
herself
as
it
was
she
began
counting
the
hours
in
one
of
the
wallflower
gaps
of
her
program
she
took
a
stroll
into
the
conservatory
it
looked
like
fairyland
with
the
colored
lanterns
hanging
among
the
palms
and
flowers
somebody
else
was
apparently
enjoying
the
pretty
effect
somebody
who
turned
round
rather
guiltily
as
if
he
were
caught
then
at
sight
of
her
smiled
in
relief
i
thought
you
were
one
of
my
hostesses
come
to
round
me
up
to
do
my
duty
he
confessed
i
a
duffer
at
dancing
so
i
taken
cover
in
here
i
see
you
do
remember
me
but
we
met
before
at
red
ridge
barrow
my
name
broughten
why
of
course
you
had
a
piece
of
candle
and
showed
us
inside
the
mound
i
ought
to
have
known
you
again
but
you
look
so
different
in
evening
dress
so
do
you
but
i
recognized
you
in
a
minute
look
here
in
sudden
compunction
am
i
keeping
you
from
a
partner
no
more
than
i
am
keeping
you
twinkled
quenrede
pointing
to
the
empty
line
on
her
program
i
not
dancing
this
so
i
came
here
to
to
enjoy
myself
her
companion
laughed
in
swift
comprehension
i
do
know
how
other
people
may
find
it
he
confided
but
hour
after
hour
of
this
sort
of
thing
gets
on
my
nerves
a
tramp
over
the
moor
is
far
more
my
line
of
amusement
i
was
wishing
i
might
go
home
so
was
i
but
there
still
at
least
another
hour
and
a
half
with
extras
more
admitted
quenrede
he
held
out
his
hand
for
her
program
i
an
idiot
at
dancing
but
would
you
mind
sitting
out
a
few
with
me
if
you
wo
talk
about
the
floor
and
the
decorations
and
the
band
and
ask
me
whether
i
been
to
the
pantomime
or
if
i
like
golf
i
promise
that
those
topics
shall
be
utterly
and
absolutely
taboo
sick
of
them
myself
quenrede
shyness
which
was
only
an
outer
casing
had
suddenly
disappeared
in
the
presence
of
a
of
social
conventions
and
conversation
came
easily
all
the
more
so
after
being
all
the
evening
henry
desmond
wandering
into
the
conservatory
presently
remarked
to
his
partner
sotto
voce
that
saxon
girl
chattering
sixteen
to
the
dozen
now
could
get
a
word
out
of
her
myself
when
quenrede
sometime
about
five
in
the
morning
tried
to
creep
stealthily
to
bed
without
disturbing
her
sister
ingred
refreshed
by
half
a
night
sleep
sat
up
wide
awake
and
demanded
details
sh
sh
mother
said
we
were
to
talk
now
and
i
must
tell
you
everything
afterwards
oh
i
got
on
better
than
i
expected
though
most
of
the
people
were
rather
starchy
how
did
my
dress
look
well
you
wo
breathe
a
word
to
darling
mother
it
was
just
passable
and
that
all
some
girls
had
things
i
did
care
the
second
part
of
the
evening
was
far
nicer
than
the
first
and
i
enjoyed
the
dances
that
i
sat
out
the
most
the
conservatory
was
all
hung
with
lanterns
there
i
dead
tired
and
i
want
to
go
to
sleep
dear
but
you

ingred
with
satisfaction
as
she
subsided
under
her
eiderdown

decidedly

in

after

clattering
of
tongues

tell

and
they
all
talked
at
once

a
new
way
of
doing
her

and

been

to

in
a
scotch
team
against
a
ladies
club
and
had
been
promised
ten
minutes
in
an
aeroplane
but
the
weather
had
been
too
stormy
for
the
flight
the
disappointment
when
she
happened
to
remember
it
quite
weighed
down
her
spirits
if
there
one
thing
on
earth
or
rather
on
air
i
like
to
be
it
a
flying
woman
she
told

emphatically
i
hoping
aeroplanes
will
get
a
little
cheaper
some
day
and
rich

will
keep
them
instead
of

then
i
go
out
as
an
aviatress

new
career
for

would
trust

about

and
nora
suiting
action
to
words
stood
on
her
bed
fluttering
her
arms
till
verity
wickedly
gave
her
a
push
behind
and
sent
her
springing
with
more
force
than
grace
to
the
floor
you
jumbo
you
make
the
room
shake
exclaimed
ingred
if
that
how
you
going
to
land
you
dig
a
hole
in
the
ground
like
a
bomb
do
move
out
and
let
me
get
to
my
drawer
you
growing
too
big
for
this
bedroom
nobody
looked
at
my
new
hair

want
to

do
look
so
scared
baby
i
chopped
my
hair
so
short
i
could
wear
a
ribbon
if
i
tried
it

be
off
in
three
cracks
stick
them
back
in
their
box
and
do
tempt

they
not
in
my
line
i
going
in
for

the
sort
who
wears
chiffons
and
laces
and
all
the
rest
of
it
but
you
see
in
gilt
buttons
before

on
them
i
hope
i
may
be
the
first
to
fly
to

who
knows
you
shall
all
have
my
photo
beforehand
just
in
case
everybody
at
the
college
and
particularly
at
the
hostel
agreed
that
the
first
few
weeks
of
the
new
term
were
trying
after
the
interval
of
the
holidays
the
yoke
of
homework
seemed
doubly
heavy
and
undoubtedly
the
prep
was
stiffer
than
ever
only
certain
hours
were
set
apart
for
study
during
the
evenings
at
the
hostel
and
any
girl
who
could
not
accomplish
her
lessons
in
that
time
had
to
finish
them
as
best
she
could
in
odd
minutes
during
the
day
or
even
in
bed
in
the
mornings
if
she
happened
to
wake
sufficiently
early
fil
who
generally
succeeded
in
mastering
about
half
her
preparation
and
no
more
railed
at
fate
i
so
unlucky
she
sighed
to
a
sympathetic
audience
in
no
i
knew
the
first
ten
lines
of
my
french
poetry
beautifully
and
i
could
have
said
them
if
mademoiselle
had
asked
me
but
of
course
she
did
she
set
me
on
those
wretched
irregular
verbs
and
they
always
floor
me
utterly
as
for
the
i
ca
spell
in
english
let
alone
french
it
not
the
least
use
for
mademoiselle
to
get
excited
and
stamp
her
foot
at
me
i
shall
be
glad
when
i
old
enough
to
leave
school
i
never
mean
to
look
at
a
french
book
again
how
about
english
spelling
suggested
ingred
you
want
to
write
a
letter
occasionally
i
think
by
that
time
said
fil
hopefully
somebody
will
have
invented
a
typewriter
that
can
spell
for
itself
you
just
press
a
knob
for
each
word
you
know
there
are
about
words
in
common
daily
use
laughed
verity
if
you
need
a
knob
for
each
your
typewriter
will
have
to
be
the
size
of
a
church
organ
it
want
a
room
to
itself
oh
but
think
of
the
convenience
of
it
no
more
hunting
in
the
dictionary
declared
fil
to
add
to
the
aggravations
of
the
new
term
the
weather
was
doubtful
and
seemed
to
take
a
spiteful
pleasure
in
being
particularly
wet
on
hockey
afternoons
day
after
day
disappointed
girls
would
watch
the
streaming
rain
and
lament
the
lack
of
practice
to
give
them
some
form
of
exercise
they
were
assembled
in
the
gymnasium
and
held
rival
displays
of
indian
clubs
morris
dancing
or
even
skipping
the
true
blues
excelled
at
high
jumping
the
pioneers
at
certain
rigid
balancing
feats
the
old
brigade
were
great
at
vaulting
and
the
amazons
and
the
mermaids
performed
marvels
in
the
way
of
swedish
boom
exercises
still
everybody
agreed
that
though
the
contests
were
fun
in
their
way
they
were
not
hockey
and
the
girls
would
much
have
preferred
the
however
wet
to
the
gymnasium
the
girls
in
the
hostel
had
the
hour
between
four
and
five
at
their
own
disposal
they
were
not
allowed
to
leave
the
college
bounds
but
they
might
amuse
themselves
as
they
pleased
in
the
garden
playground
or
gymnasium
in
turns
according
to
the
practising
list
they
had
to
devote
the
time
to
the
piano
and
a
few
even
began
their
though
this
was
not
greatly
encouraged
by
miss
burd
who
thought
a
short
brain
rest
advisable
one
afternoon
ingred
walked
along
the
corridor
with
a
big
pile
of
music
in
her
arms
just
outside
the
study
she
met
verity
and
saluted
her
cheerio
old
sport
here
linton
left
his
whole
cargo
behind
him
he
rushed
off
in
a
hurry
and
forgot
it
and
i
know
he
be
just
raging
i
going
to
ask
miss
burd
if
i
may
run
over
into
the
abbey
and
leave
it
on
the
organ
for
him
he
has
a
choir
practice
so
sure
to
find
it
will
you
come
with
me
we
both
go
in
and
ask
the
college
was
erected
upon
a
plot
of
land
which
had
originally
been
part
of
the
abbey
grounds
all
the
old
buildings
formerly
inhabited
by
the
monks
of
bidulph
and
by
the
nuns
in
the
adjoining
convent
of
mary
had
long
ago
been
swept
away
and
only
a
few
ruined
walls
marked
their
sites
the
nave
of
the
abbey
however
had
escaped
and
was
still
in
use
as
a
parish
church
though
the
beautiful
original
chancel
and
transepts
had
been
battered
down
by
henry
the
commissioners
it
was
only
a
few
hundred
yards
from
the
school
to
the
abbey
and
miss
burd
readily
gave
the
girls
permission
to
take
linton
music
and
leave
it
for
him
on
the
organ
it
was
the
first
time
either
of
them
had
been
inside
the
church
when
no
service
was
going
on
and
they
looked
round
curiously
the
organ
was
locked
or
ingred
would
certainly
never
have
resisted
the
temptation
to
put
on
the
fascinating
stops
and
pedals
she
tried
to
lift
the
lid
that
hid
the
keyboards
but
with
no
success
he
might
have
left
it
open
she
sighed
but
the
verger
would
come
fussing
up
directly
you
began
to
play
said
verity
i
do
see
the
verger
anywhere
about
why
no
more
do
i
now
you
mention
it
perhaps
he
slipped
across
to
his
cottage
to
have
his
tea
perhaps
i
say
ingred
what
a
gorgeous
opportunity
to
explore
look
round
a
little
on
our
own
there
was
nobody
to
forbid
so
they
started
on
a
tour
of
inspection
the
places
they
wanted
to
look
at
were
those
that
ordinary
never
have
a
chance
of
seeing
they
peeped
into
the
choir
vestry
and
verity
gave
rather
a
gasp
at
the
sight
of
an
array
of
white
surplices
hanging
on
the
wall
like
a
row
of
ghosts
they
went
down
a
narrow
flight
of
damp
steps
into
a
dark
place
where
the
coke
was
kept
they
peered
into
a
dusty
recess
behind
the
organ
and
into
a
room
under
the
tower
where
spare
chairs
were
stored
all
this
was
immensely
interesting
but
did
not
quite
content
them
verity
ambition
soared
farther
very
high
up
on
the
wall
above
the
glorious
pillars
and
just
under
the
clerestory
windows
was
a
narrow
passage
called
the
nuns
ambulatory
it
had
been
built
in
the
ages
to
provide
exercise
for
the
sisters
in
the
adjoining
convent
to
which
a
covered
way
had
originally
led
just
think
of
the
poor
dears
parading
round
there
on
wet
days
when
they
could
walk
in
their
own
garden
said
verity
turning
her
head
almost
upside
down
in
her
efforts
to
scan
the
passage
i
wonder
if
they
ever
felt
giddy
there
a
balustrade
of
course
but
i
prefer
our
modern
gym
i
believe
there
a
walk
all
over
the
roof
too
athelstane
went
up
once
he
said
it
was
like
being
on
the
top
of
a
mountain
and
you
could
look
all
over
the
town
what
that
queer
stone
box
thing
on
the
wall
asked
verity
still
gazing
upwards
ingred
followed
the
line
of
her
friend
eye
to
a
point
above
the
pillars
but
below
the
nuns
ambulatory
here
built
out
like
an
oriel
window
was
a
curious
of
stone
pierced
in
places
by
tiny
frets
it
seemed
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
architecture
of
the
abbey
and
indeed
to
be
a
sort
of
excrescence
which
had
been
added
to
it
at
some
later
date
it
spoilt
the
beauty
of
line
and
would
have
been
better
removed
oh
that
the
said
ingred
lowering
her
head
for
it
was
painful
to
stretch
her
neck
in
so
uncomfortable
a
position
it
was
put
up
in
the
seventeenth
century
when
the
whole
place
was
full
of
those
high
pews
people
were
very
dishonest
in
those
days
and
thieves
used
to
come
to
church
on
purpose
to
pick
pockets
so
they
always
used
to
keep
somebody
stationed
up
there
looking
down
through
the
holes
over
the
congregation
to
see
that
no
purses
were
taken
during
the
service
nice
state
of
things
was
it
rather
but
i
love
to
go
up
there
i
say
the
verger
still
at
his
tea
shall
we
try
i
game
if
you
are
by
the
north
porch
there
was
a
small
oak
door
studded
with
nails
generally
this
was
kept
locked
but
by
a
miracle
of
good
fortune
it
happened
to
be
open
it
was
of
course
a
very
unorthodox
thing
for
the
verger
to
go
away
and
leave
the
abbey
unattended
even
for
half
an
hour
but
vergers
after
all
are
only
human
and
enjoy
a
cup
of
tea
as
much
as
other
people
who
do
not
wear
black
cassocks
he
was
safely
seated
by
the
fireside
in
his
cottage
at
the
other
side
of
the
churchyard
so
the
girls
seized
their
golden
opportunity
they
went
up
and
up
and
up
along
a
winding
staircase
for
an
interminable
way
it
was
dark
and
the
steps
were
worn
with
the
tread
of
seven
centuries
and
here
and
there
was
a
broken
bit
over
which
they
had
to
clamber
with
care
at
last
after
what
seemed
like
mounting
the
tower
of
babel
they
stumbled
up
through
a
narrow
doorway
into
the
most
extraordinary
place
in
the
world
they
were
in
the
garret
of
the
roof
over
the
south
aisle
above
them
were
enormous
beams
or
rafters
and
below
a
rough
flooring
it
was
very
dim
and
dusky
but
about
midway
shone
a
bright
shaft
of
light
evidently
from
some
communication
with
the
interior
of
the
nave
towards
this
they
directed
their
steps
it
was
a
difficult
progress
owing
to
the
huge
rafters
that
supported
the
roof
a
plank
pathway
about
four
feet
above
the
floor
had
been
laid
across
the
beams
and
along
this
ingred
decided
to
venture
she
started
balancing
herself
with
her
arms
and
kept
her
equilibrium
though
the
plank
was
narrow
and
sprang
as
she
walked
verity
who
had
no
head
for
such
achievements
preferred
to
scramble
along
the
floor
creeping
under
the
rafters
in
spite
of
the
thick
dust
of
years
that
lay
there
eventually
they
both
reached
the
radius
of
light
and
found
another
doorway
leading
down
by
a
few
steps
into
what
was
apparently
a
cupboard
in
the
wall
of
the
cupboard
however
were
frets
through
which
the
sunlight
was
streaming
ingred
applied
an
eye
and
gave
a
gasp
of
satisfaction
they
were
in
the
on
the
wall
of
the
nave
and
could
gaze
straight
down
into
the
church
below
it
was
marvellous
what
an
excellent
view
they
obtained
nothing
was
hidden
not
even
the
interiors
of
the
square
pews
that
had
lingered
as
a
relic
of
the
eighteenth
century
anybody
stationed
in
this
would
certainly
be
able
to
keep
guard
over
the
congregation
and
note
any
nefarious
designs
on
the
pockets
of
the
worshipers
for
the
moment
the
church
was
empty
then
footsteps
were
audible
in
the
porch
was
it
the
verger
returning
from
his
tea
the
girls
began
to
flutter
at
the
prospect
of
his
wrath
if
he
discovered
them
it
was
no
verger
that
entered
however
but
two
young
people
far
too
much
interested
in
each
other
to
gaze
upwards
towards
the
frets
of
the
they
thought
they
had
the
church
to
themselves
and
walked
along
conversing
in
a
low
tone
the
particular
shade
of
flaxen
hair
in
the
masculine
figure
seemed
familiar
and
ingred
chuckled
as
she
recognized
her
eldest
brother
caught
you
old
boy
caught
you
neatly
she
thought
who
the
girl
oh
i
know
it
one
of
the
bertrands
queenie
said
they
were
at
the
desmonds
dance
so
i
suppose
he
met
her
there
what
a
priceless
joke
how
i
shall
crow
over
him
for
this
they
actually
going
to
sit
down
in
a
pew
and
talk
well
this
is
the
limit
quite
unconscious
that
sisterly
eyes
were
watching
egbert
ushered
his
fair
partner
into
one
of
the
square
pews
it
was
a
quiet
place
to
rest
and
perhaps
the
young
lady
was
tired
he
sat
by
her
side
very
much
occupied
in
explaining
something
which
the
girls
in
the
could
not
overhear
at
last
the
quiet
footsteps
of
the
verger
echoed
again
in
the
nave
he
glanced
at
the
young
couple
in
the
pew
and
began
to
dust
and
rearrange
the
egbert
and
miss
bertrand
took
the
hint
and
departed
the
pair
spying
through
the
fretwork
above
also
judged
it
expedient
to
beat
a
hasty
retreat
they
were
terrified
lest
the
verger
should
remember
that
he
had
left
the
tower
door
open
and
should
lock
them
in
they
stumbled
back
among
the
rafters
regardless
of
dust
and
groped
their
rather
perilous
way
down
the
winding
staircase
to
their
infinite
relief
the
door
was
not
shut
and
they
were
able
to
creep
quietly
out
and
bolt
from
the
abbey
unperceived
they
fled
along
the
stone
path
that
edged
the
churchyard
then
stopped
under
the
shelter
of
a
ruined
wall
to
brush
the
dust
off
their
dresses
before
the
college
it
been
quite
an
adventure
gasped
verity
rather
particularly
catching
old
egbert
wo
he
look
silly
when
i
bring
it
out
before
the
family
i
do
know
whether
i
tell
them
though
i
think
i
keep
it
back
so
as
to
have
something
to
hold
over
his
head
when
he
teases
me
yes
that
would
be
far
more
fun
really
i
can
hint
darkly
that
i
know
one
of
his
secrets
and
he
be
so
puzzled
i
do
admire
his
taste
much
queenie
detests
those
bertrand
girls
i
do
know
them
myself
to
speak
to
but
i
not
impressed
look
here
the
dust
simply
come
off
your
skirt
verity
it
do
as
it
is
then
and
i
use
the
clothes
brush
afterwards
do
worry
any
more
there
the
abbey
clock
striking
five
it
a
few
minutes
fast
fortunately
but
we
shall
simply
have
to
sprint
or
we
shall
be
late
for
tea
chapter
xv
brotherly
breezes
there
was
no
doubt
that
egbert
was
the
odd
one
in
the
saxon
family
he
had
inherited
a
testy
strain
of
temper
and
was
frequently
most
obstinate
and
perverse
it
was
unfortunate
that
he
was
an
articled
pupil
in
his
father
office
for
he
fretted
and
tried
saxon
far
more
than
athelstane
would
have
done
in
the
circumstances
egbert
saving
quality
was
his
intense
love
for
his
mother
her
influence
held
him
steadily
to
his
work
and
smoothed
over
many
difficult
situations
he
was
apt
to
quarrel
with
quenrede
but
he
had
a
soft
corner
for
ingred
and
sometimes
made
rather
a
pet
of
her
a
few
days
after
the
incident
at
the
abbey
he
turned
up
at
school
to
her
immense
astonishment
and
asked
leave
from
miss
burd
to
take
her
out
to
tea
at
a
cafÃ©
it
had
been
an
old
promise
on
his
part
ever
since
ingred
went
to
the
hostel
but
it
had
hung
fire
so
long
that
she
had
come
to
regard
it
as
one
of
those
piecrust
promises
that
elder
members
of
a
family
frequently
make
and
never
find
it
convenient
to
carry
out
she
had
reminded
egbert
of
it
at
intervals
all
through
the
autumn
term
then
had
given
it
up
as
a
bad
job
to
find
him
waiting
for
her
in
miss
burd
study
ready
to
escort
her
to
the
alhambra
seemed
like
a
fairy
tale
come
true
she
whisked
off
at
once
to
make
the
best
possible
toilet
in
the
circumstances
and
reappeared
smilingly
ready
when
you
have
tea
every
day
at
a
long
table
full
of
girls
the
meal
is
apt
to
grow
monotonous
and
it
was
a
welcome
change
to
take
it
instead
in
a
gay
oriental
room
with
moorish
decorations
and
luxurious
and
a
platform
in
a
corner
where
musicians
were
giving
a
capital
concert
ingred
leaned
back
on
an
embroidered
cushion
and
ate
cakes
covered
with
pink
sugar
and
listened
to
a
violin
solo
followed
by
some
charming
songs
and
watched
the
gay
crowd
sitting
at
the
other
small
tables
it
was
really
delightful
to
be
out
just
with
egbert
alone
it
made
her
feel
almost
moreover
he
was
in
such
a
remarkably
generous
mood
he
set
no
limit
to
the
supply
of
cakes
and
he
stopped
at
the
counter
as
they
went
downstairs
and
bought
her
a
box
of
chocolates
and
a
large
packet
of
edinburgh
rock
he
even
went
further
for
as
they
walked
round
the
square
together
and
looked
into
the
window
of
a
fancy
shop
he
told
her
to
choose
her
birthday
present
and
agreed
amicably
when
she
selected
a
bag
which
was
for
the
moment
the
summit
of
her
dreams
she
parted
from
him
at
the
college
gates
in
deepest
gratitude
this
was
indeed
something
like
a
brother
you
an
absolute
trump
she
assured
him
well
a
fellow
always
got
a
decent
sister
to
take
about
anyway
he
replied
enigmatically
a
remark
over
which
ingred
pondered
but
could
not
fathom
she
mentioned
the
jaunt
at
the
family
on
friday
evening
to
her
immense
surprise
her
innocent
remark
had
somewhat
the
effect
of
a
bomb
saxon
turned
to
his
son
with
a
sudden
keen
expression
as
if
he
had
convicted
him
of
a
crime
saxon
face
also
was
full
of
suppressed
meaning
while
egbert
colored
furiously
looked
thunderous
at
his
sister
and
relapsed
into
sulky
silence
poor
ingred
felt
that
she
had
quite
unconsciously
put
her
foot
in
it
though
how
or
why
she
could
not
tell
she
said
no
more
at
the
time
and
when
afterwards
she
ventured
to
refer
again
to
the
subject
she
was
so
tremendously
shut
up
that
she
saw
clearly
it
was
discreet
to
make
no
further
inquiry
plainly
there
was
some
tremendous
quarrel
between
egbert
and
his
father
for
they
were
barely
on
speaking
terms
saxon
threw
out
occasional
inuendoes
that
caused
his
son
finally
to
stump
from
the
room
saxon
went
about
with
a
cloud
of
distress
on
her
face
and
quenrede
to
whom
ingred
applied
for
enlightenment
promptly
and
pointedly
changed
the
subject
it
was
miserably
uncomfortable
for
father
and
son
were
like
two
leyden
jars
charged
with
electricity
and
ready
to
let
fly
at
any
moment
it
was
only
the
mother
influence
that
averted
a
family
thunderstorm
athelstane
too
seemed
in
the
depths
of
gloom
he
was
willing
however
to
communicate
his
woes
i
want
a
whole
heap
more
medical
books
he
confided
to
his
sister
and
dad
says
he
ca
get
them
and
i
must
manage
without
how
on
earth
i
manage
without
what
the
use
of
my
going
to
college
if
i
have
the
proper
textbooks
i
ca
always
be
borrowing
if
i
fail
in
my
exams
it
will
be
his
fault
not
mine
he
the
most
absolutely
unreasonable
man
anybody
could
have
to
deal
with
of
course
i
know
they
expensive
and
funds
are
low
but
i
simply
to
have
them
or
chuck
up
medicine
it
so
terrible
to
be
poor
sighed
quenrede
thinking
of
the
old
happy
days
at
rotherwood
when
everything
came
so
easily
and
there
were
no
struggles
to
make
ends
meet
she
talked
the
matter
over
afterwards
with
ingred
if
i
could
only
help
somehow
she
mourned
i
often
thought
i
might
go
out
and
earn
something
but
mother
not
strong
and
i
really
do
a
great
deal
in
the
house
if
i
went
away
and
left
her
with
only
orphan
she
be
laid
up
in
a
fortnight
as
it
is
she
tries
to
do
far
too
much
how
could
we
possibly
get
some
money
for
athelstane
books
we
rather
die
than
ask
our
friends
ingred
shook
her
head
sadly
wild
ideas
surged
through
her
mind
of
disguising
herself
and
sweeping
a
crossing
there
were
stories
of
wealthy
or
rivaling
charlie
chaplin
on
the
cinema
stage
but
somehow
they
did
not
seem
quite
practicable
for
a
girl
of
sixteen
she
left
quenrede
question
unanswered
it
was
only
late
on
saturday
afternoon
that
a
great
idea
came
to
her
great
but
so
overwhelming
that
she
winced
at
the
bare
notion
it
was
as
if
some
inner
voice
said
to
her
sell
derry
now
derry
the
fox
terrier
was
her
very
own
property
he
had
been
given
to
her
two
years
before
by
a
cousin
as
a
birthday
present
he
was
of
prize
breed
and
had
brought
his
pedigree
with
him
he
was
a
smart
bright
little
fellow
and
on
the
whole
a
favorite
in
the
household
though
he
sometimes
got
into
trouble
for
jumping
on
to
the
best
chairs
and
leaving
his
hairs
on
the
cushions
it
had
never
particularly
struck
ingred
that
derry
was
of
value
until
last
week
when
hardcastle
noticed
him
relations
with
that
precise
old
neighbor
next
door
had
been
rather
strained
for
a
long
time
since
the
unfortunate
episode
when
hereward
had
unwittingly
discharged
the
contents
of
the
garden
syringe
in
his
face
for
months
he
studiously
avoided
them
calling
his
collie
away
with
quite
unnecessary
caution
if
they
happened
to
pass
him
on
the
road
and
bolting
into
his
own
premises
if
they
met
near
the
gate
but
one
day
about
sam
the
collie
who
was
a
giddy
and
irresponsible
sort
of
dog
given
to
aimless
yapping
at
passing
conveyances
overdid
his
supposed
guardianship
of
his
owner
property
and
blundered
into
a
motor
that
was
whisking
by
the
car
did
not
trouble
to
stop
and
when
it
was
a
hundred
yards
away
sam
picked
himself
up
and
limped
on
three
legs
to
show
his
bleeding
paw
to
his
agitated
master
fortunately
athelstane
from
the
bungalow
garden
had
witnessed
the
accident
and
came
forward
like
a
good
samaritan
with
offers
of
help
his
elementary
acquaintance
with
surgery
stood
him
in
good
stead
and
he
neatly
set
the
injured
limb
and
bound
it
up
with
splints
and
plaster
there
had
been
many
inquiries
over
the
hedge
as
to
the
invalid
progress
and
congratulations
when
the
bandages
were
able
at
last
to
be
removed
old
hardcastle
had
waxed
quite
friendly
as
he
expressed
his
thanks
and
one
day
catching
ingred
by
the
gate
with
derry
he
had
volunteered
the
information
that
that
fox
terrier
of
yours
is
a
fine
dog
and
no
mistake
and
would
be
worth
something
to
a
fancier
sell
derry
the
idea
though
she
hated
it
had
taken
possession
of
ingred
brain
he
was
the
only
thing
she
had
that
was
of
marketable
value
to
part
with
the
poor
little
fellow
would
be
like
selling
her
birthright
but
after
all
brothers
came
first
and
how
could
athelstane
study
without
books
something
mother
had
said
the
other
day
clamored
in
her
memory
if
we
lost
our
fortune
we
got
our
family
intact
and
we
must
stick
tight
together
and
be
ready
to
make
sacrifices
for
one
another
ingred
had
quite
made
up
her
mind
she
put
on
her
hat
took
derry
from
his
cozy
place
by
the
kitchen
fire
kissed
his
nose
and
carrying
him
in
her
arms
walked
to
the
house
rang
the
bell
and
asked
to
see
hardcastle
she
found
the
old
gentleman
in
a
cozy
seated
by
a
cheery
fire
and
reading
the
evening
paper
he
looked
a
little
astonished
when
she
was
ushered
in
but
received
her
politely
as
if
it
was
quite
a
matter
of
course
for
a
young
lady
hugging
a
dog
to
pay
him
an
afternoon
visit
ingred
put
derry
down
on
the
hearth
rug
took
the
that
was
offered
her
and
with
a
beating
heart
and
a
very
high
color
plunged
into
business
and
inquired
if
it
were
possible
to
find
a
fancier
who
wished
to
buy
a
prize
fox
terrier
i
his
pedigree
here
she
finished
and
he
really
is
a
nice
little
dog
if
you
know
of
anybody
i
be
so
glad
if
you
would
tell
me
please
hardcastle
evidently
much
electrified
knitted
his
bushy
eyebrows
in
thought
and
pursed
his
mouth
into
a
button
there
was
a
vet
in
grovesbury
who
told
me
a
while
ago
that
he
wanted
one
but
i
saw
him
yesterday
and
he
said
he
had
just
bought
one
so
that
no
good
you
might
try
the
advertisements
in
he
looks
a
bright
little
chap
why
are
you
in
such
a
panic
to
get
rid
of
him
been
killing
chickens
no
said
ingred
turning
pinker
still
it
is
that
i
do
want
to
sell
him
of
course
only
only
and
then
to
her
extreme
annoyance
her
brimming
eyes
overflowed
and
she
burst
into
stifled
sobs
the
old
gentleman
shot
his
lips
in
and
out
in
mingled
consternation
and
sympathy
there
there
there
he
exclaimed
do
cry
for
goodness
sake
do
cry
tell
me
whatever
the
matter
it
was
of
course
a
most
unorthodox
thing
for
ingred
to
blurt
out
family
affairs
and
father
and
mother
would
have
been
justly
indignant
had
they
known
but
she
was
impulsive
and
without
much
worldly
wisdom
and
hardcastle
seemed
sympathetic
so
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
she
told
him
the
urgency
of
athelstane
need
and
how
she
was
trying
to
meet
it
he
sat
quite
quiet
for
a
short
time
staring
into
the
fire
then
he
said
very
gently
and
kindly
my
dear
little
girl
you
need
part
with
your
dog
i
believe
i
can
lend
your
brother
all
the
medical
books
he
wants
you
but
you
not
a
doctor
exclaimed
ingred
no
but
my
boy
was
studying
medicine
at
birkshaw
he
had
just
passed
his
intermediate
when
he
was
called
up
i
got
all
his
books
he
wo
want
them
again
now
he
was
flying
over
the
german
lines
and
his
machine
crashed
down
one
comfort
he
was
killed
instantly
he
had
always
hoped
he
never
be
taken
prisoner
i
think
he
have
liked
his
books
to
be
put
to
some
use
i
hunt
them
out
and
send
them
across
to
your
brother
and
the
microscope
and
any
other
things
i
can
find
he
may
just
as
well
have
them
there
was
a
huskiness
in
the
old
gentleman
voice
but
he
coughed
it
away
i
do
know
how
to
thank
you
stammered
ingred
i
do
want
any
thanks
it
only
a
neighborly
act
take
your
dog
home
and
say
nothing
about
all
this
i
write
to
your
brother
i
wonder
i
never
thought
about
it
before
hardcastle
was
as
good
as
his
word
for
next
monday
evening
quite
a
large
consignment
arrived
for
athelstane
with
a
note
offering
the
loan
of
books
and
microscope
if
they
would
be
of
any
service
in
his
medical
studies
why
they
absolutely
the
very
things
i
wanted
exclaimed
that
youth
rapturously
what
a
trump
he
is
a
real
good
sort
i
say
you
know
it
really
most
awfully
kind
of
him
i
wonder
what
the
dickens
put
it
into
his
head
but
on
that
point
none
of
the
family
could
enlighten
him
for
only
ingred
and
derry
knew
the
secret
and
ingred
was
at
school
while
derry
belonging
to
the
dumb
creation
expressed
his
opinions
solely
in
barks
when
the
household
was
reunited
for
next
the
clouds
had
cleared
from
athelstane
horizon
but
seemed
to
have
settled
more
darkly
than
ever
round
egbert
there
was
a
horrible
feeling
of
impending
storm
in
the
home
atmosphere
it
lent
a
constraint
to
conversation
at
meals
and
put
an
effectual
stopper
on
the
fun
which
generally
circulated
round
the
fireside
it
was
all
the
more
uncomfortable
because
nobody
voiced
the
cause
father
looks
unutterables
mother
plainly
worried
to
death
egbert
is
sulks
personified
queenie
wo
tell
athelstane
and
hereward
either
do
know
or
do
care
what
the
matter
but
it
makes
them
cross
what
is
one
to
do
with
such
a
family
thought
ingred
on
sunday
afternoon
it
had
been
wet
and
though
a
detachment
of
them
had
ventured
to
church
in
waterproofs
they
had
not
been
able
to
take
their
usual
safety
valve
of
a
walk
across
the
moors
seven
people
in
a
small
house
seem
to
get
in
one
another
way
on
sunday
afternoons
father
was
dozing
in
the
mother
athelstane
and
hereward
were
in
the
interrupting
each
other
reading
by
constant
extracts
from
their
own
books
ingred
who
hated
to
pause
in
the
midst
of
scarlet
to
hear
choice
bits
from
young
or
sought
sanctuary
in
her
bedroom
only
to
find
the
blind
drawn
and
quenrede
with
a
bad
headache
trying
to
rest
there
seemed
no
comfortable
corner
available
so
she
slipped
on
her
thick
coat
put
her
book
in
the
pocket
and
walked
down
the
garden
to
sit
in
the
even
in
the
rain
it
was
nice
out
of
doors
clumps
of
purple
and
yellow
crocuses
showed
under
the
gooseberry
bushes
lilies
were
pushing
up
green
heads
through
the
soil
the
flowering
currant
was
bursting
into
bud
roots
of
polyanthus
flaunted
mauve
and
orange
blossoms
under
a
sheltered
wall
were
even
a
few
early
violets
whose
sweet
fresh
scent
seemed
as
the
first
breath
of
spring
a
on
the
bare
pear
tree
sang
triumphantly
through
the
rain
and
a
with
more
melodious
notes
trilled
forth
an
occasional
call
the
robin
which
had
haunted
the
garden
all
the
winter
was
scraping
energetically
for
grubs
among
the
ivy
on
the
wall
and
scarcely
troubled
to
fly
away
at
her
approach
ingred
drew
great
breaths
of
wet
air
and
with
almost
the
same
instinct
as
the
thrush
broke
into
thank
god
for
a
garden
the
song
that
mother
loved
to
hear
quenrede
sing
in
the
evenings
when
the
day
work
was
over
delightful
and
refreshing
and
soothing
as
nature
may
be
however
it
is
rather
a
wet
business
to
stand
admiring
crocuses
in
the
streaming
rain
so
ingred
made
a
dash
through
the
dripping
bushes
to
the
if
she
had
calculated
upon
finding
solitude
here
she
was
disappointed
it
was
occupied
already
egbert
looking
as
gloomy
as
hamlet
was
tinkering
with
the
he
greeted
his
sister
with
something
between
a
sigh
and
a
grunt
whistled
monotonously
for
a
moment
or
two
then
burst
into
confidence
look
here
ingred
i
ca
stand
this
any
longer
i
wish
i
were
back
in
the
army
i
a
jolly
good
mind
to
chuck
everything
up
and
is
it
as
bad
as
all
that
asked
ingred
yes
i
about
fed
up
with
life
if
it
were
for
the
little
mater
have
cleared
out
before
this
perhaps
she
miss
me
but
i
do
know
that
anybody
else
will
and
i
do
care
how
about
miss
bertrand
asked
ingred
obeying
a
sudden
impulse
of
mischief
egbert
flung
down
a
spanner
and
turned
to
her
the
most
astonished
face
in
the
world
what
do
know
about
miss
bertrand
he
queried
ingred
chuckled
delightedly
to
use
her
own
schoolgirl
expression
she
felt
she
had
him
on
toast
more
than
you
imagine
who
went
into
the
abbey
church
i
should
like
to
know
and
sat
in
a
pew
for
ever
so
long
and
looked
tender
nothings
oh
yes
saw
you
and
a
pretty
sight
it
was
too
she
teased
egbert
was
gazing
at
her
as
if
he
could
scarcely
believe
his
senses
but
but
where
were
you
he
stuttered
in
the
exploded
ingred
i
could
see
right
down
into
the
church
and
i
watched
you
come
in
i
been
saving
this
up
egbert
drew
a
long
breath
if
i
only
known
before
he
said
slowly
ingred
stop
laughing
you
do
understand
look
here
will
you
go
and
tell
dad
that
you
saw
me
there
and
the
exact
day
and
time
when
it
happened
you
can
remember
that
why
surely
father
the
very
last
person
you
want
to
know
said
ingred
sobering
down
no
he
is
he
the
one
it
most
important
should
hear
about
it
from
a
reliable
witness
whom
he
can
believe
i
do
mind
telling
you
about
it
now
as
ingred
expressed
her
astonishment
in
her
face
got
myself
into
a
jolly
old
mess
and
you
be
able
to
clear
me
it
was
this
way
i
slipped
out
from
the
office
one
afternoon
for
an
hour
and
went
into
the
abbey
as
you
saw
well
when
i
got
back
somebody
had
been
into
dad
room
during
his
absence
and
a
small
sum
of
money
was
missing
he
taxed
me
with
taking
it
but
why
you
exclaimed
ingred
indignantly
because
i
was
the
only
person
who
had
access
to
his
private
room
i
told
dad
i
had
been
out
which
made
him
angrier
still
but
none
of
the
clerks
had
happened
to
see
me
go
or
come
back
and
i
had
no
other
witness
to
prove
my
words
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
went
out
before
father
and
came
back
after
he
had
returned
but
he
would
take
my
word
for
it
you
know
what
he
is
when
he
angry
you
simply
ca
argue
with
him
then
you
made
things
ever
so
much
worse
by
blurting
out
how
i
taken
you
to
tea
at
the
cafÃ©
and
bought
you
a
bag
father
glared
as
if
it
proved
i
been
spending
stolen
money
you
were
rather
flush
of
cash
that
day
commented
ingred
yes
the
fact
is
i
been
writing
a
short
story
and
it
had
been
accepted
by
a
newspaper
it
a
poor
enough
thing
and
i
did
sign
my
own
name
to
it
i
did
want
to
tell
them
at
home
i
was
trying
to
write
until
i
could
do
something
better
anyhow
i
just
cashed
the
check
and
thought
i
give
you
a
treat
for
once
i
knew
it
was
no
use
to
explain
to
father
mother
has
stuck
up
for
me
but
i
can
tell
you
been
having
a
time
of
it
this
last
fortnight
but
egbert
said
ingred
frankly
puzzled
could
you
have
got
miss
bertrand
to
tell
dad
where
you
were
it
would
have
been
better
after
all
than
letting
him
think
you
took
the
money
egbert
face
darkened
again
tragically
i
would
appeal
to
miss
bertrand
to
clear
my
character
if
it
were
a
charge
of
murder
i
be
hanged
first
i
met
her
the
very
day
after
we
were
in
the
abbey
together
she
was
walking
with
some
idiot
of
an
airman
and
she
stared
straight
in
my
face
and
cut
me
i
done
with
girls
they
all
of
them
alike
and
the
gloomy
young
misanthrope
picked
up
the
spanner
and
began
energetically
tightening
nuts
on
the
motorcycle
ingred
shook
a
sympathetic
head
she
had
not
much
experience
in
love
affairs
but
she
fancied
that
this
one
did
not
go
very
deep
you
get
over
it
she
consoled
and
she
was
a
very
nice
girl
anyway
queenie
always
loathed
her
if
dad
had
his
nap
i
go
and
tell
him
how
i
saw
you
in
the
abbey
i
know
it
was
a
tuesday
because
i
had
my
music
lesson
and
was
taking
the
books
that
linton
left
behind
him
good
that
what
called
proving
an
alibi
i
do
know
who
walked
off
with
those
notes
but
as
long
as
dad
satisfied
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
that
all
i
care
he
can
thrash
it
out
with
the
clerks
now
or
leave
it
alone

ingred
closely
but
accepted
her
account
of
the
matter
which
set
his
doubts
at
rest
concerning
his
son
the
relief
in
the
family
circle
was
enormous
mother
face
was
beaming
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
had
blown
away
and
the
sun
had
shone
out
tea
was
the
most
comfortable
meal
that
the
household
had
taken
together
for
a
fortnight
i
have
spent
quite
all
that
check
i
got
from
the
weekly
whispered
egbert

evening
and

to
buy

about
that
abbey
business
but
i
wo
say
thank
you
to
chocks
rather
not
we
have
a
gorgeous
little
private
feast

chapter
xvi
an
easter
pilgrimage
the
thirteen
weeks
between
christmas
and
easter
dragged
much
more
slowly
than
those
of
the
autumn
term
the
weather
was
cold
and
variable
as
fast
as
spring
stirred
in
the
earth
winter
seemed
to
stretch
forth
chilly
fingers
to
check
her
advent
nature
like
a
careful
mother
kept
the
buds
tightly
folded
on
the
trees
and
the
yellow
daffodil
blossoms
securely
hidden
under
their
green
casement
curtains
only
the
most
foolhardy
birds
ventured
to
begin
building
operations
the
rooks
in
the
elm
trees
near
the
abbey
had
begun
to
repair
their
nests
during
a
mild
spurt
in
january
then
put
off
further
alterations
till
late
in
march
morning
after
morning
the
girls
would
wake
to
find
the
roofs
covered
with
hoar
frost
ingred
who
hated
the
cold
shivered
as
she
crossed
the
windy
quadrangle
from
the
college
to
the
hostel
and
congratulated
herself
that
she
lived
in
the
days
of
modern
comforts
how
the
old
monks
and
nuns
managed
to
exist
in
those
wretched
chilly
damp
cloisters
i
ca
imagine
she
said
as
she
squatted
by
the
stove
warming
her
hands
were
they
allowed
to
take
hot
bricks
to
bed
with
them
in
their
cells
think
of
turning
out
for
midnight
services
into
an
unwarmed
church
it
sounds
absolutely
miserable
perhaps
they
made
themselves
more
comfortable
than
we
think
commented
verity
one
of
them
probably
kept
up
the
fire
and
doled
out
hot
drinks
after
the
services
it
might
even
have
been
possible
to
take
a
bottle
to
church
under
the
folds
of
those
ample
habits
i
do
believe
that
would
have
been
allowed
surely
the
cold
was
part
of
the
discipline
i
should
have
been
a
nun
if
i
lived
in
the
middle
ages
said
fil
i
have
wanted
to
go
to
the
tournaments
and
to
have
seen
my
knight
fighting
with
my
ribbons
in
his
helmet
and
bringing
me
the
crown
oh
would
it
have
been
fun
life
not
a
scrap
romantic
nowadays
i
do
think
men
are
slackers
why
do
they
wear
their
ladies
colors
at
football
and
let
whoever
gets
a
goal
carry
a
wreath
of
flowers
to
the
pavilion
and
crown
his
girl
of
beauty
there
be
some
excitement
in
looking
on
then
as
it
is
it
nothing
but
a
scrimmage
and
i
never
care
a
button
which
side
wins
you
need
laugh
why
should
a
footballer
look
gallant
and
present
trophies
the
world
would
jog
on
a
great
deal
better
if
there
were
more
chivalry
in
it
the
girls
want
to
play
games
themselves
nowadays
instead
of
looking
on
and
receiving
trophies
giggled
verity
i
do
declared
fil
emphatically
i
hate
tearing
about
at
hockey
or
running
at
cricket
i
far
rather
let
my
knight
do
the
work
for
me
chilly
work
looking
on
in
this
weather
the
games
keep
one
warm
said
ingred
who
was
still
only
half
thawed
in
spite
of
boisterous
march
winds
and
late
spring
frosts
the
sun
climbed
steadily
higher
in
the
sky
and
the
days
lengthened
ingred
who
used
to
arrive
home
in
the
twilight
at
wynchcote
on
friday
afternoons
could
now
dig
in
the
garden
after
tea
she
liked
the
scent
of
earth
and
was
happy
working
away
with
a
trowel
transplanting
roots
of
and
to
make
a
display
in
the
bed
near
the
window
at
school
the
various
forms
vied
with
one
another
in
shows
of
hyacinths
grown
in
bowls
the
best
of
which
were
lent
to
the
studio
on
drawing
days
and
figured
as
models
for
sketches
together
with
daffodils
and
hazel
catkins
lispeth
who
did
not
relax
the
activities
of
the
rainbow
league
revived
her
idea
of
a
posy
union
persuaded
some
of
the
girls
to
bring
little
pots
of
gay
crocuses
or
blue
squills
to
school
and
after
these
had
been
duly
exhibited
on
a
table
in
the
sent
them
through
the
agency
of
a
children
welfare
worker
to
brighten
the
bedsides
of
various
small
invalids
in
the
poorer
quarters
of
the
town
and
let
them
know
that
spring
had
arrived
was
very
near
now
and
the
school
would
break
up
for
three
weeks
miss
burd
was
going
away
to
allow
her
tired
brains
to
lie
fallow
for
a
while
and
most
of
the
other
teachers
were
looking
forward
to
a
rest
apart
from
their
forms
it
came
as
a
surprise
to
everybody
when
miss
strong
alone
among
the
staff
suggested
the
project
of
taking
some
of
her
pupils
for
a
short
walking
tour
they
were
to
start
off
like
pilgrims
of
old
carrying
with
them
the
barest
necessaries
and
have
a
four
days
tramp
to
visit
a
few
of
the
beauty
spots
of
the
neighborhood
spending
a
couple
of
nights
it
will
be
a
real
holiday
she
assured
them
we
shall
be
out
of
doors
all
day
long
and
eat
most
of
our
meals
by
the
roadside
planned
it
out
carefully
a
short
railway
journey
to
carford
then
walk
by
easy
stages
through
to
dropwick
and
pursborough
where
we
can
get
the
train
again
back
to
grovebury
i
know
of
two
extremely
nice
temperance
hotels
where
we
can
be
put
up
for
the
night
by
going
in
this
way
we
shall
see
the
cream
of
the
country
any
girl
who
is
a
good
walker
may
join
the
party
it
certainly
sounded
a
fascinating
program
and
after
due
consideration
at
home
eight
girls
put
their
names
down
for
the
excursion
ingred
verity
nora
bess
linda
francie
kitty
and
belle
they
felt
it
would
be
quite
a
new
experience
to
know
miss
strong
out
of
school
hours
the
light
in
her
eyes
when
she
announced
the
scheme
gave
promise
of
hitherto
hidden
capacities
for
fun
it
circulated
round
the
form
that
she
might
prove
quite
a
jolly
companion
those
girls
who
could
not
join
the
tour
were
a
trifle
wistful
and
inclined
towards
envy
they
took
it
out
of
the
pilgrims
in
gloomy
prognostications
concerning
the
weather
it
will
probably
rain
all
the
time
and
you
tramp
along
like
a
row
of
drowned
rats
suggested
beatrice
it
wo
do
anything
of
the
sort
i
believe
we
going
to
have
a
fine
mild
spell
and
it
will
be
just
glorious
i
taking
my
so
there
be
some
snapshots
to
show
we
been
enjoying
ourselves
retorted
nora
briskly
you
will
be
sorry
for
yourselves
when
you
hear
our
adventures
to
allow
the
weather
ample
chance
of
improvement
and
perhaps
also
to
give
miss
strong
time
to
rest
the
excursion
was
fixed
for
the
last
week
of
the
holidays
one
morning
in
therefore
found
teacher
and
pupils
meeting
together
on
the
platform
of
grovebury
station
to
catch
the
train
to
carford
they
wore
jerseys
and
their
school
hats
and
they
carried
their
luggage
according
to
their
individual
ideas
of
convenience
linda
wore
her
little
brother
satchel
slung
over
her
back
nora
had
borrowed
a
knapsack
kitty
preferred
a
parcel
verity
packed
her
possessions
in
a
string
bag
and
bess
carried
a
neat
i
a
ripping
idea
for
mine
but
it
would
work
declared
ingred
i
meant
to
tie
my
parcel
to
a
balloon
and
then
just
lead
it
along
by
a
string
but
i
could
get
a
proper
gas
balloon
for
the
business
and
that
what
you
ought
to
have
and
suppose
the
wind
were
to
blow
it
away
from
you
what
then
inquired
miss
strong
i
suppose
i
should
have
to
cable
it
round
my
waist
then
you
might
be
whisked
up
with
it
and
we
should
see
you
sailing
off
into
the
clouds
in
a
kind
of
aeroplane
holiday
instead
of
a
walking
tour
i
do
think
we
can
patent
your
balloon
dodge
yet
what
i
want
said
kitty
is
a
sort
of
child
light
arrangement
that
i
could
wheel
along
it
what
mother
always
says
she
needs
for
shopping
a
on
wheels
why
does
somebody
invent
one
he
or
she
i
sure
it
would
be
a
would
make
a
fortune
we
might
have
borrowed
a
perambulator
said
belle
quite
seriously
and
have
packed
all
our
luggage
into
it
oh
i
dare
say
and
who
would
have
wheeled
it
we
could
have
taken
it
in
turns
with
long
turns
for
the
willing
horses
and
short
turns
for
shirkers
no
thanks
better
each
to
stick
to
our
own
besides
which
forget
stiles
we
hope
to
try
some
field
paths
as
well
as
high
roads
added
miss
strong
also
i
should
decidedly
have
jibbed
at
escorting
a
perambulator
here
comes
the
train
let
us
make
a
dash
for
an
empty
carriage
and
keep
it
to
ourselves
it
was
only
a
short
journey
to
carford
but
it
took
them
over
twelve
rather
uninteresting
miles
and
put
them
down
just
at
the
commencement
of
a
very
beautiful
stretch
of
country
where
open
uplands
alternated
with
wooded
coombes
and
where
the
villages
were
the
prettiest
in
the
county
miss
strong
who
had
had
some
experience
of
mountaineering
in
switzerland
restrained
the
pace
and
kept
them
all
at
what
she
called
a
guide
walk
it
pays
in
the
long
run
she
assured
them
if
you
tear
ahead
at
first
you
get
tired
later
on
and
we
must
keep
fairly
well
together
i
ca
have
some
of
you
half
a
mile
behind
the
april
days
were
still
cold
but
very
bracing
for
exercise
lambs
were
out
in
the
fields
primroses
grew
in
clumps
under
the
hedgerows
hazel
catkins
flung
showers
of
pollen
to
the
winds
and
in
the
coppice
that
bordered
the
road
march
violets
and
white
anemone
stars
showed
through
last
year
carpet
of
dead
leaves
there
was
that
joyful
thrill
of
spring
in
the
air
that
resurrection
of
nature
when
the
thraldom
of
winter
is
over
and
beauty
comes
back
to
the
gray
dim
world
the
old
greeks
felt
it
thousands
of
years
ago
and
fabled
it
in
their
myth
of
persephone
and
her
return
from
hades
the
druids
knew
it
in
ancient
britain
and
fixed
their
religious
ceremonies
for
may
day
the
birds
were
caroling
it
still
in
the
hedgerows
and
the
girls
caught
the
joyous
infection
and
danced
along
in
defiance
of
miss
strong
guide
walk
even
the
mistress
herself
so
wise
at
the
outset
finally
flung
prudence
to
the
winds
and
skirmished
through
the
coppices
with
enthusiasm
equal
to
that
of
her
pupils
lured
from
the
pathway
by
the
glimpses
of
kingcups
or
the
pursuit
of
a
peacock
butterfly
all
the
same
if
we
tear
round
like
small
dogs
we
shall
never
reach
dropwick
and
i
booked
our
rooms
there
she
assured
them
you
do
want
to
sleep
on
the
heather
i
suppose
should
mind
laughed
kitty
we
could
cling
together
and
keep
each
other
warm
you
wo
cling
to
me
thanks
i
prefer
a
bed
of
my
own
nora
having
brought
a
good
supply
of
films
for
her
brownie
camera
was
most
keen
on
taking
snapshots
she
photographed
the
company
eating
their
lunch
on
a
bank
by
the
roadside
with
miss
strong
in
the
very
act
of
biting
a
piece
of
bread
and
butter
and
ingred
with
her
face
buried
in
a
mug
she
even
went
further
she
had
been
reading
a
book
on
faked
photography
and
she
yearned
to
try
experiments
i
going
to
give
those
a
few
thrills
she
declared
i
told
them
we
have
adventures
nora
expounded
her
plan
to
miss
strong
who
was
sufficiently
interested
in
the
subject
to
promise
her
collusion
and
good
advice
a
mock
alpine
scene
came
first
nora
had
brought
with
her
for
this
express
purpose
a
length
of
rope
which
she
wore
around
her
jersey
like
a
girdle
she
took
it
off
now
and
fastened
it
round
the
waists
of
three
of
her
schoolfellows
linking
them
together
in
the
manner
of
swiss
mountaineers
then
she
found
a
piece
of
rock
on
which
were
narrow
ledges
and
with
the
help
of
miss
strong
posed
them
in
attitudes
of
apparent
peril
really
they
were
only
a
couple
of
feet
from
the
ground
and
a
fall
would
have
been
a
laughing
matter
but
in
a
camera
they
appeared
to
be
clinging
almost
by
their
eyelashes
to
the
face
of
an
inaccessible
crag
and
in
imminent
danger
of
their
lives
nora
took
two
views
and
chuckled
with
satisfaction
that
make
their
hair
stand
on
end
i
fix
a
few
more
sensations
if
i
can
who
game
to
run
six
inches
in
front
of
a
mild
old
cow
horns
while
somebody
urges
her
on
from
behind
how
will
you
guarantee
she
mild
inquired
bess
dubiously
she
might
take
it
into
her
head
to
toss
us
not
she
it
was
only
the
with
the
crumpled
horn
that
went
in
for
tossing
well
i
rather
be
in
a
safer
photo
thanks
i
terrified
of
cows
anyway
nora
instincts
were
really
quite
dramatic
she
photographed
bess
crouching
in
the
hollow
of
a
tree
an
imaginary
fugitive
to
whom
francie
in
an
attitude
of
caution
handed
surreptitious
victuals
she
posed
linda
apparently
lifeless
on
the
borders
of
a
pond
with
kitty
and
verity
applying
artificial
respiration
she
bound
up
ingred
head
with
a
handkerchief
and
placed
her
arm
in
a
sling
as
the
result
of
a
fictitious
accident
and
would
have
arranged
a
circle
of
weeping
girls
round
the
prostrate
body
of
miss
strong
had
not
that
stalwart
lady
stoutly
objected
i
not
going
to
do
anything
of
the
sort
so
put
up
that
camera
and
come
along
at
once
we
wasted
far
too
much
time
already
and
we
shall
have
to
step
out
unless
we
want
to
finish
our
walk
in
the
dark
i
promise
you
tea
at
if
you
hurry
but
we
ca
stop
half
an
hour
there
unless
you
put
your
best
foot
foremost
so
quick
march
chapter
xvii
the
rivals
this
book
does
not
propose
to
extol
an
ideal
heroine
only
to
chronicle
the
deeds
and
thoughts
of
a
girl
who
like
most
other
girls
had
her
pleasant
and
her
disagreeable
moods
her
high
aspirations
and
good
intentions
and
her
occasional
bursts
of
bad
temper
ingred
had
been
very
passionate
as
a
child
and
though
she
had
learnt
to
put
on
the
curb
sometimes
that
uncomfortable
lower
self
would
take
the
bit
between
its
teeth
and
gallop
away
with
her
it
is
sad
to
have
to
confess
that
the
enjoyment
of
her
walking
tour
was
entirely
spoilt
by
an
ugly
little
imp
who
kept
her
company
in
plain
words
she
was
horribly
jealous
of
bess
ingred
liked
to
be
popular
she
was
gratified
to
be
warden
of
the
pioneers
and
a
member
of
the
school
parliament
she
felt
she
had
an
acknowledged
standing
not
only
in
her
own
form
but
throughout
the
college
her
official
position
her
cleverness
in
class
her
aptitude
for
music
her
skill
at
games
made
her
an
force
and
a
referee
on
most
subjects
there
is
no
doubt
that
ingred
would
have
had
the
undivided
post
of
favorite
in
her
form
had
it
not
been
for
bess
haselford
not
that
bess
was
in
any
way
a
rival
on
the
contrary
she
was
rather
shy
and
retiring
and
made
no
particular
bid
for
popularity
perhaps
that
was
one
reason
why
the
girls
liked
her
she
was
generous
in
lending
her
property
invited
her
to
charming
parties
at
rotherwood
and
often
persuaded
an
indulgent
father
to
include
some
of
her
special
chums
in
motoring
expeditions
on
saturday
afternoons
she
had
indeed
taken
up
the
exact
role
that
quenrede
had
played
years
ago
before
the
war
and
which
ingred
would
have
followed
had
rotherwood
and
a
car
still
been
in
the
saxons
possession
in
spite
of
several
overtures
from
bess
ingred
had
thrust
away
all
idea
of
friendship
and
had
steadily
refused
any
invitations
to
her
old
home
the
reports
which
the
girls
brought
back
of
the
renewed
glories
of
rotherwood
made
her
feel
like
a
disinherited
princess
she
considered
it
rough
luck
that
her
supplanter
should
be
at
the
same
school
and
in
the
same
form
as
herself
and
decided
that
bess
had
ousted
her
from
both
house
and
favor
it
made
it
only
the
more
aggravating
that
musical
talent
was
quite
equal
if
not
superior
to
her
own
bess
had
improved
immensely
on
the
violin
and
her
performance
at
the
recital
had
received
quite
a
little
ovation
when
the
question
of
the
walking
tour
was
broached
bess
owing
to
home
engagements
had
at
first
reluctantly
refused
then
had
managed
to
rearrange
her
holidays
and
had
joined
the
party
after
all
to
ingred
her
presence
utterly
marred
the
enjoyment
it
was
extremely
unreasonable
of
ingred
for
bess
was
most
unassuming
and
really
very
she
put
up
with
snubs
that
would
have
made
most
girls
retaliate
indignantly
nobody
likes
to
be
sat
upon
too
hard
however
and
even
the
proverbial
worm
will
turn
at
last
as
the
walking
party
much
urged
by
miss
strong
straggled
along
towards
bess
made
a
lightning
dive
up
a
bank
and
came
back
with
a
blue
flower
plainly
of
the
species
bugle
she
remarked
with
satisfaction
bugle
echoed
ingred
scornfully
shows
how
much
you
know
about
botany
that
oh
no
it
certainly
bugle
i
tell
you
it
i
found
some
at
lynstones
last
august
and
looked
it
up
in
the
very
likely
you
did
but
that
does
prove
that
this
is
it
does
for
anybody
with
a
pair
of
eyes
i
been
studying
botany
and
so
have
i
you
may
think
you
know
everything
bess
haselford
but
you
do
know
this
illustration
you
may
think
you
know
everything
bess
haselford
but
you
do
know
this
i
did
say
i
knew
everything
but
i
certain
this
is
bugle
all
the
same
and
i
stick
to
it
bess
usually
sweet
voice
had
an
obstinate
note
in
it
for
once
she
seemed
determined
to
defend
her
botanical
trenches
go
it
hammer
and
tongs
laughed
kitty
i
back
the
winner
and
i
take
the
case
into
court
said
linda
snatching
the
flower
from
her
schoolfellow
hand
and
running
on
to
show
it
to
miss
strong
who
was
an
authority
on
the
subject
the
mistress
paused
to
let
the
others
overtake
her
bugle
certainly
she
decided
emphatically
the
first
bit
we
found
this
year
it
out
early
oh
dear
no
the
two
are
rather
alike
and
are
sometimes
mistaken
one
for
another
but
no
botanist
would
dream
of
confusing
them
bugle
is
a
spring
and
early
summer
flower
and
blooms
much
later
make
a
note
in
your
nature
diaries
that
you
found
bugle
on
april
considerably
squashed
ingred
had
for
once
to
acknowledge
her
botany
to
be
at
fault
and
though
bess
did
not
triumph
francie
gave
kitty
a
poke
and
the
pair
giggled
well
of
course
one
ca
be
always
right
said
ingred
airily
so
it
seems
though
some
people
set
themselves
up
for
wiseacres
sniggered
kitty
ingred
fell
behind
with
verity
and
let
the
others
walk
on
it
was
only
a
trifling
incident
but
she
was
annoyed
to
notice
how
openly
and
instantly
the
girls
had
sided
with
bess
she
felt
too
glum
for
speech
and
as
verity
was
tired
and
disinclined
to
talk
they
tramped
along
in
silence
they
had
been
winding
steadily
uphill
for
some
miles
and
were
now
on
the
heath
from
which
ryton
took
its
name
the
ground
fell
steeply
to
the
west
showing
glimpses
of
a
great
river
in
the
valley
below
where
the
woods
had
burst
here
and
there
into
faint
tokens
of
spring
beyond
the
river
rose
the
characteristic
grey
hills
of
the
neighborhood
with
their
stone
walls
and
sheepfolds
and
stretches
of
moorland
looking
a
little
hazy
in
the
afternoon
light
but
with
patches
of
yellow
gorse
catching
the
sunshine
ryton
was
a
delightful
little
village
its
cottages
built
long
ago
by
local
craftsmen
seemed
absolutely
in
harmony
with
the
landscape
walls
dormers
and
mullions
and
long
undulating
roofs
were
all
of
limestone
and
conveyed
an
impression
of
sturdy
the
roofs
had
weathered
to
charming
irregularities
of
form
and
lovely
tones
of
color
ivy
and
clematis
climbed
over
the
porches
and
twisted
themselves
round
the
low
chimneys
the
little
gardens
were
bright
with
daffodils
mezereon
and
flowering
currant
to
the
girls
somewhat
tired
and
decidedly
hungry
the
main
focus
of
the
village
was
a
long
iron
post
which
stretched
out
over
the
street
and
supported
a
sign
of
a
bird
whose
species
might
have
been
a
puzzle
to
an
ornithologist
but
for
the
words
pelican
inn
that
appeared
beneath
it
in
the
days
before
railroads
the
little
hostelry
had
been
a
for
and
a
wooden
board
still
set
forth
that
it
supplied
posting
in
all
its
branches
the
landlord
would
no
doubt
have
been
much
dismayed
if
any
wag
had
entered
and
demanded
a
chaise
and
to
drive
to
gretna
green
and
a
shabby
motor
in
his
showed
that
he
marched
with
the
times
miss
strong
on
consulting
her
watch
decided
that
her
party
might
safely
indulge
in
a
halt
of
half
an
hour
and
ordered
tea
for
nine
persons
the
inn
built
on
a
type
common
in
the
district
was
entered
by
an
archway
leading
straight
into
a
courtyard
a
door
on
the
right
led
to
the
bar
and
a
door
on
the
left
to
the
to
this
latter
more
aristocratic
quarter
miss
strong
conducted
her
pupils
some
of
them
had
never
before
been
in
a
small
village
hostelry
and
were
much
amused
at
the
quaint
old
parlor
with
its
sporting
prints
its
glass
cases
of
stuffed
squirrels
and
badgers
and
its
chairs
with
crochet
antimacassars
hung
over
the
backs
the
atmosphere
was
certainly
rather
redolent
of
stale
beer
and
tobacco
but
a
bunch
of
crimson
on
the
table
did
their
best
to
spread
a
pleasant
perfume
the
tea
when
after
much
delay
it
arrived
was
delicious
the
pelican
was
a
farm
as
well
as
an
inn
and
the
servant
girl
carried
in
cream
fresh
butter
and
jam
to
the
she
apologized
for
the
absence
of
cake
but
it
was
an
omission
that
nobody
minded
upland
air
gives
good
appetites
and
though
miss
strong
reminded
her
flock
that
this
was
only
a
meal
by
the
way
and
that
supper
was
ordered
for
them
at
dropwick
they
set
to
work
as
if
they
would
taste
nothing
more
till
midnight
there
was
something
so
delightfully
fresh
and
out
of
the
common
in
having
tea
at
a
wayside
inn
they
felt
true
pilgrims
of
the
road
and
civilization
and
school
seemed
to
have
faded
into
a
far
background
the
love
of
travel
is
in
the
blood
of
both
celt
and
our
forefathers
visited
shrines
for
the
joy
of
the
journey
as
well
as
for
religious
motives
and
maybe
our
bronze
age
ancestors
who
flocked
to
the
great
sun
festivals
at
stonehenge
or
avebury
circles
derived
pleasure
from
the
change
of
scene
as
well
as
a
blessing
from
the
druids
the
romans
those
great
pioneers
of
travel
had
opened
out
the
district
eighteen
centuries
ago
and
laid
a
straight
paved
road
from
wendcester
to
pursborough
the
remains
of
their
fortified
camps
and
of
their
villas
were
still
left
to
mark
their
era
the
leading
from
to
dropwick
was
their
handiwork
and
our
pilgrims
were
to
march
on
the
identical
track
of
some
old
roman
legion
it
must
be
owned
that
when
tea
was
finished
they
were
very
unwilling
pilgrims
and
would
gladly
have
spent
the
night
at
the
pelican
and
have
slept
in
the
funny
musty
little
bedrooms
upstairs
could
we
possibly
stop
here
implored
verity
but
miss
strong
having
booked
rooms
in
dropwick
was
adamant
besides
which
i
would
trust
the
beds
here
she
remarked
so
early
in
the
year
they
almost
bound
to
be
damp
and
we
do
want
any
of
you
laid
up
with
rheumatic
fever
as
the
result
of
our
trip
i
prefer
to
give
a
wayside
inn
a
week
notice
if
i
mean
to
sleep
there
in
april
nobody
has
had
enough
coal
during
the
winter
to
keep
fires
going
in
spare
bedrooms
that
front
room
was
as
chilly
as
a
country
church
you
wo
feel
so
tired
verity
when
you
on
your
feet
again
and
all
downhill
to
dropwick
the
temperance
hotel
where
the
girls
finally
stayed
their
weary
feet
was
quite
modern
and
unromantic
though
well
aired
and
fairly
comfortable
ingred
whom
the
fates
had
placed
to
sleep
with
nora
had
a
trying
night
for
her
obstreperous
bedfellow
had
a
habit
of
flinging
out
her
arms
and
of
appropriating
the
larger
half
of
the
clothes
leaving
poor
ingred
to
wake
shivering
also
the
bed
sloped
towards
the
middle
so
that
both
girls
had
to
poise
themselves
on
a
kind
of
hillside
and
were
constantly
rolling
down
and
colliding
these
troubles
however
were
only
incidental
in
the
pilgrimage
and
certainly
might
have
been
worse
on
comparing
notes
at
breakfast
nearly
everybody
had
had
similar
experiences
miss
strong
confessed
to
a
patent
mattress
with
a
broken
spring
jutting
up
in
the
center
round
which
she
had
been
obliged
to
lie
in
a
curve
linda
and
francie
had
slept
near
the
which
alarmed
them
with
weird
noises
and
bess
and
kitty
trying
to
open
their
window
wider
had
found
it
lacked
and
descended
like
a
guillotine
sending
the
prop
that
had
upheld
it
flying
into
the
street
though
they
groused
at
the
time
the
girls
laughed
as
they
discussed
these
details
over
the
eggs
and
bacon
the
sun
was
shining
and
they
felt
rested
and
quite
ready
once
more
to
shoulder
their
kit
and
set
out
on
the
march
there
was
nothing
of
very
great
interest
to
see
in
dropwick
itself
though
it
was
a
quaint
enough
with
a
church
tower
and
a
few
black
and
white
houses
miss
strong
decided
not
to
waste
any
time
there
but
to
push
on
as
fast
as
possible
across
the
hills
to
sudbury
where
there
was
a
fine
villa
that
was
well
worth
a
visit
so
the
took
them
up
and
up
and
up
through
where
the
new
cones
were
showing
like
candles
on
christmas
trees
and
alongside
a
quarry
where
they
pounced
upon
some
quite
interesting
fossils
in
the
heaps
of
stones
by
the
road
and
over
a
craggy
peak
where
again
they
caught
the
magnificent
view
of
the
valley
and
the
river
and
hills
beyond
then
down
again
through
more
where
the
timber
was
being
felled
and
great
lay
piled
in
rows
one
above
another
and
past
banks
that
were
a
dream
with
starry
blackthorn
blossom
and
primroses
growing
beneath
to
where
the
met
and
the
signpost
pointed
an
arm
to
sudbury
the
romans
might
take
their
roads
straight
as
an
arrow
across
moor
and
hill
but
they
chose
out
the
beauty
spots
of
the
land
on
which
to
build
their
villas
and
were
careful
to
fix
upon
a
southern
aspect
and
shelter
from
the
prevailing
winds
the
remains
of
the
old
settlement
lay
behind
a
farm
and
had
been
carefully
excavated
by
a
local
antiquarian
society
visitors
applied
at
the
farmhouse
entered
their
names
in
a
book
paid
their
admission
money
and
were
escorted
round
by
a
guide
time
and
successive
conquests
had
demolished
the
greater
part
of
the
villa
but
its
foundations
and
some
of
the
old
brick
walls
could
be
plainly
traced
the
great
bath
that
indispensable
feature
of
a
roman
establishment
could
still
be
seen
with
its
beautiful
tesselated
pavement
inlaid
with
mosaics
of
doves
cupids
and
designs
of
fruit
and
flowers
the
heating
system
also
with
the
leaden
pipes
and
remains
of
furnaces
was
a
testimony
to
the
civilization
of
the
period
and
the
amount
of
comfort
that
the
legions
brought
with
them
into
their
foreign
exile
a
large
shed
had
been
fitted
up
as
a
museum
and
held
a
number
of
objects
that
had
been
dug
up
during
the
excavations
the
girls
poring
over
the
glass
cases
looked
with
interest
at
a
roman
lady
silver
toilet
pots
and
tiny
shears
that
must
have
been
the
early
substitute
for
scissors
more
fascinating
still
were
the
toys
from
a
little
child
grave
small
glass
bottles
animals
of
clay
and
a
carved
object
that
no
doubt
had
been
at
one
time
a
treasured
doll
though
now
it
was
crumbling
into
dust
among
the
pile
of
broken
statues
or
fragments
of
ornamental
stonework
in
the
corner
was
a
monumental
tablet
cracked
across
in
two
places
but
pieced
together
for
preservation
with
iron
rivets
the
inscription
ran
simpliciÃ¦
florentinÃ¦
animÃ¦
innocentissimÃ¦
quÃ¦
vixit
menses
decem
felicius

a
most
innocent
soul
who
lived
ten
months
felicius
simplex
of
the
sixth
legion
the
victorious
the
father
erected
this
some
of
the
girls
glanced
at
the
tablet
and
the
english
translation
of
the
inscription
which
lay
near
and
turned
away
without
much
notice
but
ingred
stood
gazing
at
them
with
a
catch
in
her
throat
they
brought
a
whole
pathetic
human
story
to
life
again
she
could
picture
the
noble
roman
father
leader
of
the
victorious
legion
sent
over
from
italy
and
making
his
home
here
in
a
conquered
foreign
land
as
our
officers
do
in
india
and
bringing
with
him
his
lady
with
her
roman
customs
and
her
slaves
those
few
brief
words
a
most
innocent
soul
who
lived
ten
months
told
the
tragedy
of
the
cherished
little
daughter
whose
frail
life
faded
in
the
fogs
of
the
british
climate
about
eighteen
hundred
years
ago
hearts
are
the
same
all
the
world
over
and
the
pretty
roman
baby
must
have
been
laid
to
its
rest
with
as
much
grief
and
sadness
as
the
darlings
whom
british
mothers
sometimes
bury
in
indian
soil
it
a
sweet
name
too
simplicia
florentina
mused
ingred
i
wonder
what
she
would
have
grown
up
like
and
what
her
history
would
have
been
i
give
worlds
to
know
more
about
her
are
you
coming
ingred
called
verity
from
the
doorway
miss
strong
says
we
ought
to
be
getting
on
now
ingred
brought
her
thoughts
back
with
an
effort
to
the
twentieth
century
and
joined
the
waiting
party
outside
miss
strong
was
talking
to
their
guide
who
was
describing
a
short
cut
across
the
fields
that
would
save
them
several
miles
on
their
way
to
pursborough
verity
after
calling
to
her
friend
in
the
museum
had
run
out
ingred
followed
her
to
find
her
with
her
arm
locked
closely
through
bess
there
was
no
reason
why
she
should
not
display
such
a
mark
of
affection
but
to
ingred
it
seemed
little
short
of
an
insult
to
herself
verity
her
particular
chum
to
have
openly
gone
over
to
the
enemy
she
stared
at
her
in
surprise
verity
did
not
appear
to
notice
the
stare
however
and
walked
on
quite
calmly
miss
strong
had
decided
that
they
should
find
a
quiet
place
along
the
lane
where
they
could
eat
their
lunch
before
beginning
the
second
part
of
their
march
she
fixed
on
a
lovely
spot
with
a
high
wooded
bank
at
the
back
and
in
front
fields
that
sloped
to
the
river
there
were
specks
of
yellow
in
these
fields
and
kitty
who
finished
her
sandwiches
first
ran
to
inspect
nearer
and
reported
cowslips
instantly
most
of
the
girls
went
scrambling
over
the
stile
miss
strong
who
had
bought
of
the
roman
villa
and
was
addressing
them
with
a
did
not
follow
the
exodus
she
called
to
ingred
however
who
was
last
warn
the
girls
she
said
not
on
any
account
to
go
into
that
meadow
where
there
is
a
horse
with
a
young
foal
the
guide
at
the
farm
said
it
is
a
savage
beast
and
will
attack
people
be
sure
to
tell
them
i
run
after
them
now
answered
ingred
calling
cuckoo
to
attract
their
attention
she
told
belle
and
linda
and
verity
who
were
near
to
the
stile
and
linda
passed
the
news
on
to
francie
and
kitty
bess
was
quite
a
long
distance
down
the
field
gathering
blackthorn
from
the
hedge
i
not
going
to
tear
all
that
way
after
her
thought
ingred
crossly
verity
will
be
sure
to
tell
her
they
seem
inseparable
besides
which
nobody
particularly
likely
to
go
into
that
other
meadow
there
are
plenty
of
cowslips
here
it
took
miss
strong
a
much
longer
time
to
write
her
postcards
than
she
had
originally
intended
and
while
she
was
thus
employed
her
girls
spread
themselves
out
in
quest
of
flowers
it
is
always
amazing
when
you
start
rambling
in
company
with
others
how
quickly
you
can
find
yourself
alone
by
the
time
ingred
had
gathered
a
fragrant
bunch
and
looked
round
for
somebody
to
admire
it
her
schoolmates
were
gone
she
hunted
about
for
them
and
noticed
verity
green
jersey
and
brown
in
the
wood
above
surely
they
must
all
be
up
there
together
she
was
just
going
to
follow
when
a
qualm
of
conscience
seized
her
she
had
not
delivered
miss
strong
message
to
bess
and
it
would
perhaps
be
as
well
to
ascertain
that
the
latter
had
not
strayed
unwarned
into
the
danger
zone
it
not
at
all
likely
ingred
kept
repeating
to
herself
as
she
walked
briskly
along
the
meadow
to
the
fence
i
really
only
going
on
a
wild
goose
chase
likely
or
unlikely
it
was
the
very
thing
which
had
happened
the
cowslips
on
the
other
side
of
the
railings
were
larger
and
finer
and
bess
having
no
fear
of
horses
had
climbed
over
and
wandered
some
way
down
the
field
only
about
twenty
yards
from
her
the
lanky
foal
was
gambolling
round
its
mother
a
big
draught
mare
cropping
the
grass
innocently
enough
at
present
and
apparently
not
perceiving
trespassers
if
bess
could
retreat
quietly
and
unnoticed
from
the
field
all
might
be
well
ingred
did
not
dare
to
call
for
fear
of
attracting
the
attention
if
bess
would
only
turn
round
she
might
wave
to
her
but
bess
kept
her
back
to
the
fence
and
had
no
idea
of
danger
there
was
only
one
course
open
to
ingred
she
slipped
over
the
railings
and
went
along
the
meadow
to
warn
her
schoolfellow
in
a
few
quiet
words
she
explained
the
situation
do
run
she
whispered
let
us
walk
back
and
perhaps
it
will
take
no
notice
of
us
the
girls
went
as
softly
as
possible
looking
over
their
shoulders
every
now
and
then
to
see
that
all
was
safe
of
bulls
they
had
a
wholesome
terror
but
they
had
had
no
previous
experience
of
a
savage
horse
they
were
about
fifteen
yards
from
the
railings
when
the
mare
which
hitherto
had
been
feeding
quietly
raised
her
head
and
lumbered
round
she
saw
strangers
in
her
territory
her
primeval
instinct
was
to
protect
her
foal
and
she
came
tearing
across
the
field
with
wild
eyes
and
lip
turned
back
from
gleaming
teeth
the
girls
fled
for
their
lives
it
was
a
question
of
which
could
reach
the
railings
first
they
or
the
dangerous
brute
whose
huge
hoofs
thundered
behind
them
ingred
who
was
the
taller
and
the
stronger
of
the
two
seized
bess
by
the
hand
and
literally
dragged
her
along
together
they
tumbled
over
the
fence
somehow
and
rolled
down
the
bank
into
the
safe
shelter
of
some
gorse
bushes
for
a
moment
they
were
afraid
the
mare
would
leap
after
them
but
the
height
of
the
rails
balked
her
apparently
she
was
satisfied
with
routing
the
enemy
and
returned
across
the
field
to
her
foal
the
girls
with
shaking
knees
got
up
and
hurried
towards
the
lane
where
they
had
left
miss
strong
you
saved
my
life
ingred
gasped
bess
as
they
went
along
no
i
have
choked
ingred
at
least
it
was
my
fault
you
ever
went
into
the
field
at
all
miss
strong
told
me
to
tell
you
the
horse
was
savage
and
you
were
such
a
long
way
off
picking
cowslips
that
i
trouble
to
go
after
you
i
trusted
to
verity
telling
you
verity
ran
the
other
way
with
kitty
i
know
well
at
any
rate
it
was
my
fault
and
i
ready
to
take
the
blame
precious
row
i
shall
get
into
with
the
snark
why
should
we
say
anything
about
it
not
say
anything
there
really
no
need
it
over
and
done
with
now
i
do
want
to
get
you
into
a
scrape
i
vote
we
just
keep
it
to
ourselves
ingred
paused
with
her
hand
on
the
gate
and
gazed
with
unaffected
astonishment
at
her
companion
bess
haselford
you
the
biggest
trump
i
ever
met
it
only
one
girl
in
a
thousand
who
want
to
cover
up
a
thing
like
that
most
people
would
make
a
tale
of
it
and
pose
as
an
injured
martyr
whom
nearly
murdered
i
sure
francie
would
or
even
verity
you
put
yourself
into
danger
to
come
and
warn
me
well
it
was
the
least
i
could
do
let
forget
about
it
then
and
do
tell
any
of
the
girls
in
case
they
blab
it
would
make
miss
strong
so
nervous
she
be
scared
about
our
going
into
any
fields
for
ever
afterwards
i
wo
tell
but
i
sha
forget
as
i
said
before
i
think
you
the
biggest
trump
on
the
face
of
the
earth
cuckoo
rang
out
linda
voice
from
the
bank
where
are
you
girls
shouted
miss
strong
from
the
lane
coming
called
ingred
as
she
latched
the
gate
and
hurried
with
bess
to
rejoin
the
rest
of
the
party
chapter
xviii
bess
at
home
the
pilgrims
after
a
glorious
tramp
down
the
dale
of
beechcombe
reached
pursborough
without
further
adventure
and
spent
the
night
there
they
gave
an
hour
next
morning
to
inspecting
the
glorious
old
church
and
the
ruins
of
the
castle
then
once
more
resumed
the
roman
road
it
was
the
last
day
of
their
tour
so
they
made
the
best
of
it
they
explored
some
delightful
woods
followed
the
course
of
a
fascinating
stream
ate
their
lunch
in
a
picturesque
quarry
had
an
early
tea
at
a
wayside
inn
which
rivalled
the
pelican
in
quaintness
and
finally
reached
ribstang
in
time
to
catch
the
train
to
grovebury
the
conclusion
of
the
excursion
meant
the
close
of
the
holiday
for
school
would
begin
again
on
the
following
monday
everybody
had
enjoyed
it
immensely
and
everybody
was
only
too
sorry
it
was
over
to
ingred
it
marked
an
epoch
she
had
suddenly
made
friends
with
bess
haselford
now
she
viewed
bess
with
unprejudiced
eyes
she
realized
what
an
exceedingly
nice
and
attractive
girl
she
really
was
the
adventure
in
the
field
had
flung
them
together
and
much
to
the
astonishment
of
the
others
who
did
not
know
their
secret
they
had
walked
the
whole
way
from
pursborough
to
ribstang
in
each
other
company
i
ca
make
out
ingred
declared
verity
here
she
been
abusing
bess
and
calling
her
a
bounder
and
now
she
hanging
on
her
arm
the
way
some
people
turn
round
is
really
most
extraordinary
naught
so
queer
as
folks
quoted
linda
glad
ingred
come
to
her
senses
at
any
rate
i
always
thought
she
was
perfectly
beastly
to
bess
so
she
was
i
wonder
bess
will
put
up
with
her
now
i
sure
i
would
bess
however
was
of
a
forgiving
disposition
and
let
bygones
be
bygones
it
is
the
only
plan
at
schools
for
girls
are
generally
so
frank
in
the
nature
of
their
remarks
that
if
you
begin
to
treasure
up
the
disagreeable
things
said
to
you
and
let
them
rankle
you
will
probably
find
yourself
without
a
chum
in
the
world
though
the
fashion
may
be
for
plain
speaking
it
is
often
a
matter
of
mood
and
the
mate
who
genuinely
believes
you
a
blighter
one
day
will
claim
you
as
a
mascot
with
equal
persuasion
on
the
next
it
is
all
part
of
the
wholesome
of
your
education
and
proves
of
as
much
use
in
training
you
and
rounding
your
projecting
corners
as
the
lessons
you
learn
in
your
form
the
girls
thought
ingred
new
infatuation
would
soon
wear
off
but
it
had
come
to
stay
she
herself
was
quite
surprised
at
the
force
of
the
attraction
it
was
almost
like
falling
in
love
she
marched
with
bess
at
drilling
chose
her
for
her
partner
at
tennis
and
would
have
changed
desks
to
sit
next
to
her
had
not
miss
strong
refused
permission
as
a
natural
result
of
this
new
state
of
affairs
came
a
shy
invitation
from
bess
asking
ingred
to
tea
at
rotherwood
after
the
many
previous
refusals
she
would
hardly
have
ventured
to
give
in
but
for
several
hints
which
paved
the
way
circumstances
however
alter
cases
and
ingred
who
had
declared
that
nothing
should
induce
her
to
set
foot
in
her
old
home
was
now
all
eagerness
to
go
she
was
delighted
to
find
that
she
was
to
be
the
only
guest
she
felt
that
on
this
particular
visit
even
verity
would
be
on
a
certain
tuesday
afternoon
therefore
with
full
permission
from
miss
burd
she
absented
herself
from
the
hostel
and
walked
home
with
bess
instead
it
gave
her
quite
a
thrill
to
turn
in
at
the
familiar
gate
of
rotherwood
the
lawns
were
in
beautiful
order
and
the
beds
gay
with
tulips
aubrietias
and
a
lovely
show
of
hyacinths
so
far
from
being
neglected
the
place
seemed
even
better
kept
than
in
the
old
days
the
house
with
its
pretty
modern
front
its
many
gables
and
its
cheerful
roof
looked
the
same
as
formerly
but
indoors
there
were
great
changes
the
hall
which
used
to
be
moorish
was
now
hung
with
tapestry
and
furnished
in
old
oak
the
was
yellow
instead
of
blue
with
a
big
couch
and
a
chappell
piano
the
had
rows
of
and
some
good
the
was
a
cheerful
chintz
boudoir
with
a
gilt
mirror
and
chippendale
chairs
the
conservatory
was
full
of
choice
flowers
and
an
aviary
had
been
added
to
it
mother
is
so
fond
of
birds
explained
bess
they
amuse
her
when
her
head
bad
and
she
does
care
to
see
anybody
she
made
most
of
them
wonderfully
tame
haselford
proved
to
be
a
gentle
pleasant
lady
who
shook
hands
kindly
with
ingred
then
excused
herself
on
the
score
of
and
retired
to
her
room
leaving
the
girls
to
have
tea
by
themselves
mother
never
been
really
well
for
three
years
said
bess
not
since
bert
and
larry
she
did
not
finish
her
sentence
but
her
eyes
turned
to
the
wall
where
hung
two
portraits
of
lads
in
khaki
ingred
understood
she
knew
that
bess
had
lost
both
brothers
in
the
war
and
she
had
heard
that
poor
haselford
had
shut
herself
up
in
her
grief
and
refused
all
comfort
sometimes
even
to
the
extent
of
remaining
for
days
upstairs
and
neglecting
the
company
of
husband
and
child
her
attitude
to
bess
was
often
peculiar
it
was
almost
as
if
she
resented
her
daughter
being
left
when
her
adored
boys
had
been
taken
from
her
bess
never
knew
how
she
would
be
received
for
sometimes
her
mother
would
seem
unable
to
bear
her
presence
and
at
other
times
would
unreasonably
chide
her
for
neglect
it
began
to
dawn
on
ingred
how
very
lonely
her
friend
must
be
she
had
secretly
envied
her
the
possession
of
rotherwood
but
now
she
realized
how
little
the
house
itself
would
mean
without
the
happy
home
life
in
which
brothers
and
sister
had
borne
their
part
i
rather
have
the
bungalow
with
the
family
than
rotherwood
all
alone
she
ruminated
as
for
muvkins
she
one
in
a
million
i
believe
she
be
cheery
in
a
coal
cellar
so
long
as
she
a
solitary
chick
to
keep
under
her
wing
why
if
we
lost
boys
she
have
been
trying
to
make
it
up
to
queenie
and
me
for
not
having
brothers
i
know
her
that
her
way
bess
had
much
to
show
to
her
visitor
when
tea
in
the
dainty
was
over
there
were
her
books
and
her
photographs
and
postcard
albums
and
all
kinds
of
girlish
possessions
and
a
cocker
spaniel
with
three
puppies
as
fat
as
puddings
and
a
opening
out
of
one
of
her
bedroom
windows
and
a
collection
of
pressed
wild
flowers
and
a
green
parroquet
that
would
sit
on
her
wrist
and
allow
her
to
stroke
its
head
though
it
snapped
at
strangers
they
had
been
working
upwards
through
the
house
and
finally
bess
led
the
way
to
the
top
landing
of
all
she
paused
for
a
moment
before
the
door
of
an
attic
room
i
expect
you
know
this
place
she
remarked
shyly
ushering
in
her
guest
ingred
looked
round
in
amazement
it
was
a
little
sanctum
which
she
and
quenrede
had
shared
in
the
old
days
as
a
kind
of
studio
here
they
had
been
allowed
to
try
experiments
in
poker
work
painting
or
any
other
operations
which
were
considered
too
messy
to
be
performed
in
the
downstairs
they
had
loved
their
den
as
they
called
it
and
had
taken
a
particular
pleasure
in
covering
its
walls
with
pictures
cut
most
of
them
from
magazines
and
stuck
on
with
glue
or
paste
during
the
occupation
of
rotherwood
by
the
red
cross
this
room
had
been
locked
up
and
ingred
had
imagined
that
haselford
would
have
had
it
papered
when
the
rest
of
the
house
was
decorated
she
was
delighted
to
find
it
in
this
untouched
condition
all
her
dear
former
treasures
adorned
the
walls
and
she
ran
from
one
to
another
rejoicing
over
them
there
was
even
a
further
surprise
years
ago
an
artist
cousin
had
sketched
her
portrait
in
pastel
crayons
upon
the
of
the
wall
it
had
been
done
as
a
mere
artistic
freak
but
like
many
such
spontaneous
drawings
it
had
been
an
admirable
likeness
and
a
very
pretty
picture
it
bore
her
name
ingred
in
flourishy
letters
underneath
the
whole
of
this
had
now
been
protected
with
a
sheet
of
glass
and
enclosed
by
a
frame
a
table
in
the
room
an
easy
chair
and
a
seemed
to
point
to
its
occasional
occupation
you
actually
have
had
this
changed
exclaimed
ingred
i
thought
it
must
all
have
been
swept
away
by
now
no
you
see
father
took
me
over
the
house
when
first
he
decided
to
come
here
and
when
he
was
arranging
what
papers
to
choose
i
fell
in
love
with
this
dear
wee
room
just
as
it
was
and
begged
that
it
be
touched
father
let
me
have
it
for
my
very
own
it
was
so
different
from
all
other
rooms
i
liked
the
pictures
pasted
on
the
walls
and
the
bits
of
nailed
up
i
knew
some
other
girls
must
have
been
here
and
it
gave
me
a
homely
feeling
as
if
you
had
only
gone
away
for
a
few
minutes
and
might
come
back
any
time
and
talk
to
me
then
there
was
your
portrait
i
wondered
who
was
the
name
struck
my
fancy
immensely
and
so
did
the
face
you
remember
we
removed
to
rotherwood
at
the
end
of
july
and
all
the
rest
of
the
summer
i
wondered
about
the
portrait
i
used
to
come
up
here
and
sit
when
i
felt
very
lonely
and
it
seemed
company
somehow
you
ca
think
how
fond
i
got
of
it
i
suppose
i
was
rather
silly
and
absurd
but
i
knew
nobody
in
grovebury
then
and
mother
was
ill
in
her
room
and
father
away
all
day
anyhow
i
got
into
the
habit
of
talking
to
it
as
if
it
were
a
girl
friend
and
showing
it
my
paintings
and
my
pressed
flowers
and
everything
i
was
doing
i
pretended
it
liked
to
see
them
sometimes
i
even
brought
up
my
violin
and
played
to
it
that
was
nicer
than
being
quite
by
myself
it
grew
to
be
as
dear
to
me
as
the
little
sister
i
had
always
longed
to
have
then
in
september
i
went
to
the
college
you
can
imagine
what
a
start
it
gave
me
when
somebody
called
you
i
looked
at
you
and
i
saw
at
once
that
you
were
the
of
my
picture
only
grown
older
i
was
absolutely
thrilled
it
was
very
foolish
of
me
but
i
thought
somehow
you
understand
of
course
you
did
how
could
you
it
was
idiotic
of
me
to
expect
it
the
on
the
wall
was
simply
the
friend
of
my
fancy
and
the
real
one
was
just
hateful
to
you
said
ingred
sorrowfully
i
know
i
was
a
perfect
beast
i
was
ashamed
of
myself
all
the
time
only
i
would
confess
it
lispeth
used
to
slate
me
sometimes
for
my
nastiness
she
called
me
jealous
blighter
and
so
i
was
the
girl
of
your
fancy
is
a
great
deal
nicer
than
i
am
or
ever
can
be
but
i
try
to
live
up
to
her
as
well
as
i
can
bess
if
you
let
me
let
you
echoed
bess
linking
her
arm
affectionately
in
that
of
her
friend
you
a
perfect
dear
nowadays
the
girls
tore
themselves
away
quite
regretfully
from
the
little
attic
studio
but
time
was
passing
only
too
quickly
and
they
wished
to
try
a
game
of
tennis
before
ingred
returned
to
the
hostel
so
you
like
the
house
in
its
new
dress
asked
bess
as
they
walked
down
the
steps
into
the
garden
father
thinks
it
beautiful
he
says
saxon
is
the
best
architect
he
knows
he
simply
put
every
thing
in
exactly
the
right
place
does
he
only
design
houses
or
does
he
go
in
for
anything
bigger
he
would
if
he
got
the
chance
replied
ingred
what
sort
of
things
do
you
mean
oh
a
church
or
a
museum
or
an
art
gallery
i
know
he
done
most
splendid
designs
for
these
but
he
never
had
the
luck
to
get
them
accepted
there
generally
so
much
influence
needed
to
get
your
plans
taken
for
a
big
public
building
like
that
at
least
that
what
dad
says
if
you
have
a
relation
on
the
city
council
it
makes
a
vast
difference
to
your
chances
we
no
friends
at
court
oh
said
bess
rather
abstractedly
and
the
subject
dropped
the
girls
had
only
time
for
one
game
of
tennis
when
the
chiming
six
reminded
ingred
that
if
she
wished
to
do
her
preparation
that
evening
she
must
rush
back
to
the
hotel
she
bade
bess
a
reluctant
you
come
and
see
me
again
asked
the
latter
rather
and
i
send
to
animate
my
portrait
and
let
it
talk
for
me
in
my
absence
laughed
ingred
perhaps
you
get
more
than
you
bargain
for
i
an
awful
you
never
talk
too
much
for
me
said
bess
as
she
kissed
her
chapter
xix
the
nun
walk
the
saxon
family
agreed
that
whatever
might
be
the
drawbacks
of
in
wintry
weather
it
was
an
idyllic
spot
in
the
month
of
may
the
which
ingred
had
transplanted
were
now
in
their
prime
the
apple
trees
were
in
blossom
clumps
of
lilies
were
pushing
up
fast
and
pink
double
daisies
bordered
the
front
walk
the
woods
in
the
combe
below
the
moor
were
a
mass
of
bluebells
and
here
and
there
those
who
searched
might
find
rarer
flowers
orchises
lily
of
the
valley
and
true
lover
knot
friends
who
had
shirked
the
journey
while
the
winds
blew
cold
now
began
to
drop
in
at
the
bungalow
and
take
tea
under
the
apple
trees
ingred
returning
home
on
friday
afternoons
would
find
bicycles
stacked
by
the
gate
and
visitors
seated
in
the
garden
she
greeted
them
with
enthusiasm
or
the
reverse
according
to
her
individual
tastes
really
ingred
they
do
seem
to
teach
manners
at
the
college
now
said
quenrede
one
day
the
way
you
scowled
at
galsworthy
and
gertrude
was
most
uncivil
you
did
look
in
the
very
least
pleased
to
see
them
i
was
they
the
most
stupid
people
on
the
face
of
the
earth
and
they
stayed
such
ages
i
thought
they
never
go
just
when
i
wanted
a
nice
private
talk
with
you
and
mother
before
the
boys
came
back
why
should
you
look
glad
to
see
a
person
when
you
not
for
the
sake
of
manners
my
dear
then
manners
really
mean
humbug
declared
ingred
who
loved
to
argue
to
say
you
glad
to
see
people
when
you
not
is
telling
deliberate
fibs
most
hypocritical
i
call
it
why
ca
people
tell
the
truth
because
it
would
generally
be
offensive
and
unkind
to
do
so
put
in
mother
who
happened
to
overhear
there
another
side
to
the
question
too
when
you
say
against
your
will
that
you
are
glad
to
see
somebody
you
mean
that
all
the
part
of
you
is
glad
the
kind
generous
part
that
likes
to
give
pleasure
not
the
selfish
lower
part
that
only
thinks
of
its
own
convenience
so
you
are
not
really
telling
a
fib
but
being
true
to
your
nobler
self
a
great
deal
of
what
people
call
speaking
is
simply
giving
rein
to
their
most
uncharitable
thoughts
as
a
rule
i
say
heaven
defend
me
from
those
souls
who
enjoy
their
minds
but
are
we
to
gush
over
every
bore
asked
ingred
there
are
limits
of
course
we
ca
let
all
our
time
be
frittered
away
by
idle
friends
but
we
can
generally
manage
tactfully
without
offending
them
do
look
so
childie
nobody
else
is
coming
and
i
promise
you
tea
in
the
woods
by
ourselves
unless
anyone
very
nice
comes
over
to
join
us
put
in
quenrede
quickly
you
girls
shall
give
the
invitations
i
wo
bring
any
people
laughed
mother
with
a
sly
glance
at
quenrede
the
party
in
the
bluebell
woods
on
saturday
was
entirely
a
family
one
with
the
exception
of
broughten
who
rode
over
on
a
ostensibly
to
lend
some
microscopic
slides
to
athelstane
though
ingred
suspected
there
was
another
attraction
in
the
visit
quenrede
who
professed
great
surprise
gave
him
a
guarded
welcome
after
all
the
fuss
you
made
about
my
manners
yesterday
you
might
have
seemed
more
glad
to
see
him
sniffed
ingred
critically
might
i
well
really
i
think
i
going
to
hang
a
label
round
my
neck
to
meet
you
let
all
come
it
would
save
trouble
stick
tight
to
me
when
we
gathering
bluebells
three
better
company
sometimes
than
two
do
i
like
him
oh
yes
he
all
right
but
not
keen
on
a
after
which
hint
ingred
who
had
some
acquaintance
with
the
perversity
of
quenrede
feminine
mind
did
exactly
the
opposite
and
abandoning
her
basket
to
the
custody
of
broughten
left
him
helping
her
sister
to
gather
bluebells
and
took
herself
off
with
hereward
he
not
half
bad
she
ruminated
laughingly
not
of
course
a
fairy
prince
exactly
or
even
a
member
of
parliament
but
the
bubbles
on
the
pool
by
the
whispering
stones
certainly
came
to
and
his
name
is
for
i
asked
athelstane
there
the
finger
of
fate
about
it
and
queenie
had
better
make
up
her
mind
with
ingred
however
school
matters
were
at
present
much
more
interesting
than
speculating
about
her
sister
possible
future
it
was
an
interesting
term
at
the
college
cricket
and
tennis
were
in
full
swing
and
she
took
an
active
part
in
both
the
best
of
being
at
the
hostel
was
that
the
boarders
had
the
benefit
of
the
tennis
courts
in
the
evening
and
so
secured
an
advantage
in
the
matter
of
practice
over
any
girls
who
did
not
possess
a
private
court
at
home
so
far
the
college
had
not
competed
in
tournaments
but
blossom
webster
was
hopeful
that
later
on
in
the
term
some
champions
might
be
chosen
who
would
not
disgrace
the
games
club
meantime
she
urged
everybody
to
practice
and
coached
her
favorites
with
the
eye
of
an
expert
nora
was
particularly
marked
out
for
future
distinction
she
had
made
tremendous
strides
lately
and
her
swift
serves
were
the
terror
of
her
opponents
the
hostel
felt
justly
proud
of
her
achievements
and
would
collect
in
the
evening
after
to
watch
her
play
a
set
of
singles
with
susie
wakefield
who
though
older
and
taller
almost
invariably
lost
susie
had
good
points
of
her
own
however
and
with
nora
as
partner
could
beat
even
blossom
and
aline
occasionally
no
doubt
the
future
credit
of
the
school
was
in
their
hands
one
evening
it
happened
that
nora
was
in
a
particularly
slashing
and
reckless
mood
and
she
sent
no
less
than
three
balls
flying
straight
over
the
wall
that
bordered
the
tennis
courts
they
fell
into
the
premises
of
old
broadfield
whose
garden
adjoined
that
of
the
school
they
were
not
the
first
that
had
done
so
indeed
so
many
balls
had
gone
over
lately
that
the
loss
was
growing
serious
at
one
time
the
girls
had
been
wont
to
ring
broadfield
bell
and
beg
permission
to
pick
up
their
property
but
they
had
been
received
so
sourly
by
his
elderly
housekeeper
that
they
hardly
dared
to
ask
again
three
good
balls
gone
in
half
an
hour
grieved
verity
there
soon
be
none
left
at
this
rate
i
believe
there
must
be
a
dozen
at
least
lying
on
the
grass
over
there
only
that
stingy
old
thing
wo
throw
them
back
it
really
too
bad
how
could
we
possibly
get
them
ruminated
doreen
sham
ill
get
broadfield
to
attend
and
coax
them
out
of
him
suggested
fil
doreen
shook
her
head
he
not
the
school
doctor
unfortunately
when
millie
sprained
her
ankle
miss
burd
sent
for
harrison
we
might
fish
for
them
with
a
butterfly
net
tied
to
the
end
of
a
drilling
pole
if
they
anywhere
near
enough
they
not
i
peeped
over
the
wall
and
they
rolled
quite
a
long
way
off
how
weak
what
are
we
to
do
there
nothing
for
it
said
ingred
slowly
but
to
make
a
sally
into
the
enemy
trenches
and
fetch
them
back
oh
i
dare
say
but
who
going
to
do
the
sallying
business
will
if
you
like
yes
i
do
mind
a
scrap
you
heroine
do
mensh
but
suppose
you
caught
i
shall
have
to
risk
that
of
course
i
reconnoiter
carefully
first
the
boundary
between
the
college
premises
and
the
property
of
broadfield
was
part
of
the
old
abbey
wall
the
mortar
had
crumbled
away
from
the
stones
leaving
large
interstices
so
it
was
quite
easy
to
climb
with
a
little
boosting
from
verity
and
nora
ingred
successfully
reached
the
top
and
peered
over
into
the
neighboring
garden
just
below
her
was
a
rockery
which
offered
not
only
an
easy
means
of
descent
but
a
quick
mode
of
egress
in
the
case
of
the
necessity
of
beating
a
hasty
retreat
beyond
the
and
lying
on
the
lawn
were
no
less
than
seven
tennis
balls
marked
with
the
unmistakable
blue
cross
that
claimed
them
for
the
college
the
sight
was
enough
to
spur
on
the
faintest
heart
apparently
there
was
nobody
in
this
part
of
the
garden
and
no
watchful
face
peered
from
any
of
the
windows
it
was
certainly
an
opportunity
that
ought
not
to
be
missed
ingred
slipped
first
one
foot
and
then
the
other
over
the
wall
and
dropped
on
to
the
rockery
it
was
the
work
of
a
minute
to
pick
up
the
balls
and
throw
them
back
to
rejoicing
friends
if
she
herself
had
followed
immediately
there
would
have
been
no
sequel
to
the
episode
but
happening
to
look
under
the
bushes
she
noticed
another
ball
and
went
in
quest
of
it
it
seemed
a
shame
to
return
until
she
had
found
any
that
might
have
strayed
farther
afield
so
she
dived
under
the
rhododendron
bushes
and
was
rewarded
with
two
more
balls
she
had
issued
out
on
to
another
part
of
the
lawn
and
was
on
the
very
point
of
retreating
when
she
suddenly
heard
voices
on
the
path
between
the
bushes
to
run
to
the
wall
would
be
to
cross
open
country
so
with
an
instinctive
desire
to
seek
cover
she
dived
into
a
close
by
and
shut
the
door
the
footsteps
came
nearer
were
they
going
to
follow
her
into
her
retreat
and
catch
her
it
would
be
too
ignominious
peeping
warily
through
a
small
window
of
the
she
saw
two
young
people
apparently
much
interested
in
each
other
strolling
leisurely
up
to
her
immense
relief
they
did
not
attempt
to
enter
but
sat
down
on
a
seat
outside
the
window
they
were
so
near
that
she
could
perforce
hear
every
word
and
was
an
unwilling
but
compulsory
eavesdropper
at
first
the
conversation
consisted
mostly
of
tender
nothings
he
certainly
called
her
darling
she
replied
oh
donald
do
and
a
sound
followed
so
suspiciously
like
a
kiss
that
ingred
only
a
few
feet
away
from
them
almost
giggled
aloud
she
wondered
how
long
they
were
going
to
keep
her
a
prisoner
it
might
be
very
pleasant
for
themselves
to
sit
spooning
in
the
garden
on
a
mild
may
evening
but
if
they
prolonged
their
enjoyment
beyond
eight
the
hostel
would
ring
and
any
girl
not
in
her
place
at
the
table
would
lose
a
mark
for
punctuality
he
on
the
other
side
of
the
window
was
waxing
sentimental
about
old
times
and
bygone
days
i
glad
you
not
a
nun
darling
he
remarked
fatuously
if
you
had
lived
in
the
ancient
abbey
i
should
have
been
able
to
walk
about
the
garden
with
you
should
i
i
suppose
not
she
ventured
especially
if
you
been
a
monk
i
dare
say
some
of
them
manage
to
do
a
little
sometimes
though
what
that
story
about
the
ghost
the
white
nun
do
you
mean
the
one
that
haunts
the
college
gardens
ingred
pricked
up
her
ears
at
this
yes
is
there
some
legend
or
other
about
her
i
believe
there
is
but
i
forgotten
it
i
only
know
she
walks
on
moonlight
nights
down
the
steps
by
the
and
then
disappears
into
the
wall
near
the
abbey
at
least
she
supposed
to
i
never
met
anybody
who
seen
her
do
talk
of
such
shuddery
things
you
make
me
feel
creepy
apparently
he
offered
masculine
protection
for
another
suggestive
sound
was
followed
by
a
giggle
and
a
remonstrance
the
hostel
bell
was
ringing
and
the
abbey
clock
was
striking
eight
were
they
going
to
stay
talking
all
night
ingred
was
growing
desperate
she
wondered
how
she
was
going
to
explain
her
absence
to
best
she
even
debated
whether
it
would
be
advisable
to
open
the
door
bolt
across
the
lawn
and
trust
to
luck
that
the
matter
was
not
reported
at
the
college
she
had
her
hand
on
the
latch
when
the
feminine
voice
outside
remarked
it
getting
chilly
donald
do
catch
cold
darling
with
tender
solicitude
would
you
rather
go
indoors
hooray
triumphed
ingred
inwardly
though
she
did
not
dare
to
utter
a
sound
it
took
a
little
while
for
the
lovers
to
get
under
way
and
finally
stroll
back
along
the
path
among
the
bushes
ingred
gave
them
time
to
walk
out
of
sight
and
hearing
then
made
a
dash
for
the
rockery
scrambled
over
the
wall
tore
across
the
tennis
courts
and
entered
the
nearly
ten
minutes
late
for
supper
best
looked
at
her
reproachfully
and
doreen
who
was
monitress
for
the
month
took
a
notebook
from
her
pocket
and
made
an
entry
therein
nora
and
verity
and
fil
went
on
eating
sago
with
stolid
countenances
that
betrayed
no
knowledge
of
their
doings
but
that
night
when
the
foursomes
met
in
the
privacy
of
dormitory
they
demanded
an
account
of
her
adventure
she
certainly
had
a
piece
of
interesting
news
to
confide
did
you
know
that
a
ghost
haunts
the
garden
no
oh
i
say
where
that
part
by
the
i
heard
it
called
nun
walk
so
have
i
but
i
never
knew
there
was
a
ghost
it
supposed
to
walk
on
moonlight
nights
how
fearfully
thrillsome
i
never
seen
a
ghost
shivered
fil
no
more
have
i
and
i
never
met
anyone
who
exactly
has
generally
their
cousin
cousin
who
told
them
about
it
there
a
moon
remarked
nora
so
there
is
the
four
girls
looked
at
one
another
hair
brushes
in
hand
each
had
it
on
the
tip
of
her
tongue
to
make
a
suggestion
i
you
to
go
said
verity
at
last
not
alone
fil
was
clutching
already
at
nora
hand
well
no
hardly
alone
i
vote
we
all
go
together
and
try
if
we
can
see
anything
it
would
be
rather
spooksomely
jinky
well
look
here
do
let
undress
properly
but
get
into
bed
and
cover
ourselves
up
until
nurse
has
been
her
rounds
then
we
slip
downstairs
and
out
through
the
side
door
into
the
garden
are
you
game
who
afraid
said
ingred
valiantly
upstairs
in
their
bedroom
with
the
gas
turned
on
it
was
easy
enough
to
feel
courageous
their
spirits
rose
indeed
at
the
prospect
of
such
an
adventure
nurse
warner
who
came
into
the
room
a
little
later
looked
round
at
the
four
beds
turned
out
the
gas
and
departed
without
a
suspicion
she
had
not
been
gone
five
minutes
when
a
surreptitious
dressing
took
place
and
four
figures
in
dark
coats
stole
down
the
stairs
though
the
building
of
the
college
might
be
absolutely
modern
the
garden
was
a
relic
of
mediÃ¦val
days
it
had
formerly
belonged
to
the
nunnery
of
mary
and
had
adjoined
the
abbey
parts
of
the
crumbling
old
wall
were
still
left
and
a
flagged
path
led
from
a
to
some
ruins
in
the
it
was
a
cheerful
place
and
a
blaze
of
color
the
girls
had
never
before
seen
it
in
its
night
aspect
on
this
may
evening
it
had
a
quiet
beauty
that
was
most
impressive
the
full
moon
shone
on
the
great
dark
pile
of
the
abbey
towers
and
the
beech
avenue
beyond
there
was
just
light
enough
in
the
garden
to
distinguish
bushes
as
heavy
masses
and
to
trace
the
paths
from
the
grass
the
air
was
sweet
with
the
scent
of
flowers
it
is
amazing
how
different
conditions
can
alter
a
scene
at
noon
with
the
hum
from
the
busy
streets
it
was
commonplace
enough
by
moonlight
it
became
a
mystic
bower
of
enchantment
the
girls
walked
along
very
quietly
treading
on
the
grass
so
as
to
make
no
noise
a
slight
mist
was
rising
from
the
ground
near
the
abbey
in
the
rays
of
the
moon
it
resembled
a
lake
everything
indeed
was
altered
the
outline
of
the
sumach
bush
was
like
a
crouching
tiger
the
laburnum
tassels
waved
like
skeleton
fingers
it
seemed
a
witching
unreal
world
four
rather
scared
girls
crept
along
clasping
hands
for
moral
support
each
secretly
would
have
been
relieved
to
abandon
the
quest
but
did
not
like
to
be
the
first
to
turn
tail
they
had
determined
to
walk
from
the
to
the
abbey
wall
and
back
again
so
far
the
garden
though
mysterious
showed
no
signs
of
anything
supernatural
they
began
to
pluck
up
courage
and
even
to
talk
to
one
another
in
low
whispers
at
the
ruins
they
turned
and
looked
back
towards
the
the
moonlight
streamed
along
the
flagged
path
and
shimmered
on
the
clumps
of
early
yellow
lilies
what
was
that
stealing
from
under
the
shelter
of
the
hawthorn
tree
the
girls
gasped
and
almost
stopped
breathing
illustration
a
tall
figure
clothed
in
some
white
garment
was
gliding
towards
them
a
tall
figure
clothed
in
some
long
white
garment
was
gliding
towards
them
it
kept
in
the
shadow
and
they
could
see
no
details
only
a
light
mass
that
was
slowly
and
steadily
advancing
apparently
straight
to
where
they
were
crouching
beside
the
wall
fil
was
trembling
like
a
leaf
nora
declared
afterward
that
her
hair
stood
on
end
ingred
and
verity
felt
shivers
run
down
their
spines
nearer
and
nearer
came
the
white
figure
its
approach
was
more
than
flesh
and
blood
could
stand
with
a
wild
shriek
fil
dashed
across
the
lawn
followed
closely
by
nora
ingred
and
verity
girls
cried
a
clear
and
voice
girls
stop
what
are
you
doing
here
there
was
no
mistaking
the
tone
of
command
of
the
four
amazed
and
crestfallen
damsels
halted
and
turned
back
to
find
miss
burd
attired
in
a
white
standing
in
the
moonlight
on
the
grass
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
she
asked
and
why
are
you
all
in
bed
it
is
always
difficult
to
give
explanations
and
to
such
a
person
as
miss
burd
it
seemed
particularly
silly
to
have
to
confess
that
they
had
come
out
and
had
mistaken
her
for
a
spirit
she
emptied
the
vials
of
her
scorn
upon
their
dejected
heads
do
let
me
hear
of
any
more
nonsense
of
this
sort
she
finished
i
should
have
thought
you
were
too
intelligent
to
believe
in
such
rubbish
as
for
leaving
your
dormitory
at
this
hour
you
deserve
to
be
locked
in
the
for
the
night
i
shall
of
course
report
you
to
best
and
none
of
you
will
play
tennis
for
a
week
as
a
punishment
miss
burd
bristling
with
anger
swept
the
delinquents
before
her
to
the
door
of
the
hostel
and
watched
them
flee
upstairs
then
went
to
lay
the
matter
before
best
in
dormitory
four
girls
got
into
bed
at
topmost
speed
of
all
the
mourned
fil
i
did
know
miss
burd
prowled
about
the
garden
in
a
exclaimed
ingred
she
look
exactly
like
a
ghost
confirmed
verity
tennis
off
for
a
whole
week
blossom
will
be
furious
it
too
absolutely
grizzly
for
anything
groused
nora
i
wish
the
wretched
old
ghost
had
been
at
jericho
before
we
went
to
look
for
it
chapter
xx
under
the
lanterns
it
is
an
ill
wind
that
blows
nobody
good
and
though
nora
fil
ingred
and
verity
might
chafe
at
being
debarred
from
tennis
for
a
whole
week
their
adventure
in
the
garden
had
given
them
an
idea
how
it
exactly
originated
could
not
be
decided
for
each
fiercely
claimed
the
full
credit
for
it
its
evolution
however
was
somewhat
as
follows
stage
how
lovely
the
garden
looked
in
the
evening
stage
why
should
we
not
enjoy
it
some
time
stage
miss
burd
evidently
does
stage
and
looked
very
fascinating
in
her
white
stage
it
was
exactly
like
a
fancy
dress
stage
why
should
not
we
all
wear
fancy
dress
stage
us
ask
miss
burd
to
let
the
hostel
have
a
dance
in
the
school
great
minds
generally
think
in
company
and
often
hit
upon
the
same
invention
at
the
same
moment
so
perhaps
all
four
girls
had
an
equal
share
in
the
they
communicated
it
cautiously
to
companions
and
as
it
caught
on
they
sounded
best
and
finding
her
favorably
disposed
to
the
scheme
begged
her
to
intercede
for
them
with
miss
burd
the
was
wonderfully
gracious
about
the
matter
gave
full
permission
for
the
dance
promised
to
be
present
herself
and
allowed
the
invitation
to
be
extended
to
any
mistresses
and
seniors
who
would
care
to
join
the
party
it
was
quite
a
long
time
since
the
hostel
had
had
any
particularly
exciting
doings
so
that
the
girls
flung
themselves
into
their
preparation
with
much
enthusiasm
those
who
were
lucky
enough
already
to
possess
fancy
costumes
or
who
were
able
to
borrow
them
of
course
scored
and
the
rest
set
to
work
to
manufacture
anything
that
came
to
hand
it
was
to
be
in
the
nature
of
an
impromptu
affair
but
a
few
days
notice
was
given
and
the
girls
were
able
to
devote
a
saturday
to
the
problem
ingred
home
for
the
enlisted
the
help
of
mother
and
quenrede
and
turned
the
bungalow
almost
upside
down
in
her
quest
for
suitable
accessories
she
thought
of
a
number
of
characters
she
would
have
liked
to
impersonate
but
was
always
balked
by
the
lack
of
some
vital
article
of
dress
it
no
use
she
lamented
i
ca
be
of
arc
without
a
suit
of
armor
or
elizabeth
when
i
have
a
flowered
velvet
robe
so
tired
of
all
the
old
things
it
too
stale
to
twist
some
roses
in
my
hair
for
and
i
been
a
gipsy
so
often
that
everybody
knows
my
red
handkerchief
and
gilt
beads
i
as
soon
be
a
red
indian
squaw
and
why
should
you
be
asked
quenrede
it
a
remarkably
pretty
costume
oh
i
dare
say
if
i
could
beg
borrow
or
steal
it
you
no
need
to
do
either
my
dear
i
had
a
and
fix
it
up
for
you
at
home
yes
i
mean
it
allow
me
to
introduce
myself
quenrede
saxon
court
costumier
the
very
latest
theatrical
productions
i
make
you
look
so
that
your
own
mother
will
hardly
know
you
i
like
to
puzzle
them
rejoiced
ingred
miss
burd
said
she
should
have
a
parade
and
hinted
something
about
a
prize
they
always
give
points
to
whoever
has
the
best
disguise
masks
are
barred
but
we
may
paint
our
faces
i
think
i
shall
be
rather
choice
as
a
squaw
you
ought
to
have
me
with
you
as
your
chuckled
hereward
it
a
only
dance
so
you
ca
be
invited
my
boy
there
wo
be
a
solitary
masculine
individual
present
even
the
gardener
will
have
gone
home
you
bet
folks
will
peep
in
no
they
wo
the
premises
are
strictly
private
quenrede
was
in
some
respects
a
clever
and
ingenious
little
person
she
was
not
much
good
at
ordinary
dressmaking
where
fashion
must
be
followed
but
she
displayed
great
originality
in
her
construction
of
ingred
fancy
costume
there
were
two
clean
sacks
in
the
house
and
she
commandeered
them
she
cut
one
into
a
skirt
and
the
other
into
a
jumper
stitched
up
the
sides
and
frayed
out
the
bottoms
to
represent
fringes
then
she
took
her
paints
mixed
them
with
chinese
white
to
form
a
strong
body
color
and
painted
indian
patterns
on
both
garments
the
she
considered
a
triumph
she
went
to
a
neighboring
poultry
farm
and
boldly
begged
the
tail
feathers
which
had
been
plucked
the
day
before
from
some
game
fowls
these
she
glued
round
a
cardboard
crown
and
the
effect
was
magnificent
a
dress
rehearsal
was
held
and
the
family
rejoiced
over
ingred
most
decidedly
wild
west
appearance
you
have
a
pair
of
real
moccasins
that
uncle
ernest
sent
you
for
bedroom
slippers
i
cut
some
strips
of
cloth
into
fringe
for
leggings
and
you
can
wear
athelstane
leather
belt
and
carry
an
axe
for
a
tomahawk
said
quenrede
surveying
her
work
with
critical
satisfaction
do
forget
to
paint
your
face
i
sha
show
anyone
my
costume
beforehand
chuckled
ingred
i
really
do
believe
anyone
will
know
me
what
luck
if
i
won
a
prize
for
the
best
disguise
bet
you
anything
you
like
you
do
murmured
hereward
why
should
i
because
there
may
be
others
even
better
well
of
course
that
for
miss
burd
to
judge
but
i
think
i
a
sporting
chance
at
any
rate
the
dance
was
to
be
held
on
monday
evening
after
supper
when
it
was
just
beginning
to
grow
dusk
the
mistresses
had
taken
the
matter
up
quite
enthusiastically
and
had
stretched
some
wires
across
the
garden
and
hung
up
chinese
lanterns
the
hostel
piano
had
been
pulled
close
to
the
window
so
that
the
strains
of
music
could
float
out
into
the
garden
at
least
fifteen
seniors
had
accepted
the
invitation
and
it
was
rumored
that
miss
burd
had
invited
a
few
private
friends
supper
was
held
earlier
than
usual
so
as
to
allow
time
for
the
operation
of
dressing
and
the
moment
it
was
finished
every
inmate
of
the
hostel
fled
to
her
bedroom
dormitory
was
naturally
a
scene
of
much
confusion
the
girls
tried
to
put
on
their
own
costumes
and
help
each
other
at
the
same
time
fil
as
a
dresden
china
shepherdess
needed
much
assistance
in
the
settling
of
her
panniers
and
the
arrangement
of
her
curls
which
by
special
permission
from
best
had
been
twisted
up
in
curl
papers
from
four
until
the
last
available
moment
and
came
out
much
to
fil
satisfaction
in
quite
creditable
ringlets
the
effect
was
so
altogether
charming
that
her
called
a
general
halt
for
admiration
you
look
like
a
mixture
of
dolly
varden
and
sweet
lavender
with
a
dash
of
maid
marian
thrown
in
decided
verity
i
hope
my
hair
keep
in
curl
there
rather
a
damp
feeling
in
the
air
fluttered
fil
anxiously
you
could
fly
indoors
and
give
it
a
twist
with
the
tongs
if
it
gets
very
limp
suggested
nora
nora
herself
was
going
as
a
personification
of
the
kitchen
her
skirt
was
draped
with
dusters
and
she
wore
a
small
as
a
hat
were
suspended
round
her
neck
as
a
necklace
and
she
brandished
a
in
her
hand
i
bound
to
be
something
comic
she
assured
the
others
i
never
keep
my
face
straight
for
a
romantic
character
i
could
no
more
live
up
to
lady
jane
grey
than
i
could
fly
she
above
me
altogether
verity
who
had
borrowed
a
dutch
costume
slightly
too
small
for
her
was
trying
to
squeeze
her
proportions
into
the
tight
velvet
bodice
and
looked
dubiously
at
the
sabots
i
never
be
able
to
dance
in
those
she
decided
i
put
them
on
to
start
with
and
then
kick
them
off
and
slip
on
my
sandals
instead
they
the
most
extraordinary
clumpy
things
in
the
world
i
feel
like
a
cat
walking
in
walnut
shells
ingred
toilet
progressed
very
favorably
till
it
came
to
the
stage
of
coloring
her
face
she
was
not
quite
sure
as
to
the
best
means
of
obtaining
a
red
indian
complexion
first
she
tried
rubbing
it
with
soil
from
the
garden
but
that
was
a
painful
process
which
almost
scraped
the
skin
from
her
cheeks
so
she
washed
her
face
and
used
cocoa
she
mixed
it
in
a
cup
and
dabbed
it
over
but
it
would
not
go
on
smoothly
and
the
result
was
so
patchy
and
hideous
that
once
more
she
brought
out
her
sponge
and
wiped
it
off
at
that
point
verity
came
to
the
rescue
smeared
the
poor
cheeks
already
sore
through
such
with
vanishing
cream
then
powdered
on
some
dry
cocoa
which
certainly
gave
a
dusky
and
aspect
to
her
features
especially
when
combined
with
the
feather
her
dark
hair
plaited
in
two
long
tails
completed
the
illusion
the
girls
held
a
complacent
review
of
their
toilets
then
walked
downstairs
with
caution
for
nora
was
difficult
to
balance
as
a
hat
and
verity
heels
kept
slipping
out
of
the
sabots
fil
ringlets
alas
were
already
beginning
to
untwist
and
ingred
jumper
put
on
in
too
big
a
hurry
showed
symptoms
of
splitting
down
the
seam
there
was
no
time
for
repairs
of
any
sort
however
they
were
five
minutes
late
and
the
rest
of
the
company
were
assembled
on
the
lawn
the
boarders
from
the
hostel
together
with
mistresses
and
seniors
who
had
come
by
invitation
made
a
total
of
more
than
fifty
persons
all
in
fancy
dress
these
gay
costumes
were
a
pretty
sight
against
the
background
of
trees
and
bushes
and
the
sun
had
set
leaving
a
yellow
glow
in
the
sky
and
the
chinese
lanterns
were
beginning
to
glow
in
the
gathering
twilight
it
was
certainly
a
varied
crowd
all
centuries
had
met
together
a
japanese
damsel
walked
with
a
lancashire
witch
an
italian
peasant
with
the
queen
of
sheba
a
spanish
lady
was
talking
to
old
mother
hubbard
while
such
characters
as
a
medicine
bottle
or
an
aeroplane
rubbed
shoulders
with
an
egyptian
princess
or
dick
whittington
cat
miss
burd
garbed
appropriately
as
chaucer
prioress
received
the
company
at
the
top
of
the
steps
looking
in
the
opinion
of
the
foursome
league
quite
sufficiently
like
the
ghost
of
yesterday
to
have
justified
squeals
had
they
met
her
alone
when
the
ceremony
of
introduction
was
over
the
guests
dispersed
about
the
lawn
miss
perry
struck
up
a
waltz
on
the
piano
and
the
fun
began
dancing
on
the
grass
in
the
growing
darkness
with
the
chinese
lanterns
sending
out
a
soft
but
uncertain
radiance
overhead
was
a
new
experience
to
most
of
the
school
it
was
difficult
not
to
step
on
to
the
or
to
brush
against
the
bushes
trailing
garments
were
decidedly
in
the
way
and
came
to
grief
there
was
a
delirious
sort
of
eastern
feeling
about
it
a
kind
of
combination
of
the
thousand
and
one
nights
and
the
rubÃ¡iyat
of
omar
khayyam
the
abbey
tower
for
once
seemed
out
of
place
and
ought
to
have
changed
miraculously
into
a
pagoda
or
a
minaret
it
was
after
the
girls
had
been
dancing
for
some
little
time
that
ingred
first
noticed
a
couple
whom
she
did
not
remember
to
have
seen
before
they
followed
persistently
in
her
steps
and
even
gently
bumped
into
her
once
or
twice
thus
compelling
her
attention
she
looked
at
them
considerably
mystified
one
was
attired
in
early
victorian
costume
with
a
crinoline
a
little
tippet
and
a
poke
bonnet
from
which
peeped
some
bewitching
ringlets
the
other
in
a
gorgeous
turkish
costume
was
enveloped
in
a
shimmering
gauze
veil
who
are
those
ingred
asked
her
partner
but
verity
could
not
tell
in
the
twilight
it
was
of
course
easy
to
make
mistakes
but
ingred
began
to
have
a
strong
suspicion
that
neither
of
the
mysterious
partners
belonged
to
the
school
they
were
certainly
not
members
of
the
fifth
or
sixth
perhaps
some
of
the
juniors
had
forced
themselves
in
no
they
were
too
tall
for
juniors
perhaps
they
are
ghosts
shivered
verity
ghosts
do
bump
into
people
these
are
real
substantial
flesh
and
blood
it
so
dark
we
can
hardly
see
well
i
vote
we
keep
close
to
them
and
next
time
we
get
near
a
lantern
we
turn
the
tables
and
bump
into
them
and
try
to
see
who
they
are
it
was
easier
said
than
done
however
the
strangers
seemed
to
have
changed
their
tactics
and
instead
of
pursuing
ingred
and
verity
now
endeavored
to
avoid
them
no
elusive
pimpernels
could
have
been
more
difficult
to
follow
they
would
come
quite
close
and
then
suddenly
dodge
and
glide
away
only
to
reappear
and
repeat
the
same
tantalizing
performance
ingred
and
verity
began
to
get
on
their
mettle
it
was
so
evidently
done
on
purpose
that
they
were
fully
determined
to
catch
the
errant
pair
after
a
long
game
at
they
at
last
managed
to
dance
along
side
them
and
laying
violent
hands
upon
them
to
drag
them
into
the
light
of
a
lantern
as
ingred
gazed
for
a
moment
in
perplexity
the
early
victorian
lady
gave
a
most
victorian
wink
inside
the
poke
bonnet
hereward
how
you
gasped
his
sister
a
firm
hand
drew
her
away
from
the
light
and
in
the
shelter
of
a
laurel
bush
a
voice
choking
with
laughter
proclaimed
done
you
old
girl
done
you
brown
what
about
that
bet
i
told
you
you
never
know
me
you
abominable
young
wretch
replied
ingred
laughing
in
spite
of
herself
how
you
manage
it
and
who
is
your
friend
allow
me
to
introduce
vashti
queen
of
persia
bunkum
it
a
boy
i
know
it
is
the
explosive
sounds
issuing
from
under
the
shimmering
veil
of
queen
vashti
certainly
sounded
more
masculine
than
feminine
and
that
persian
princess
confessed
presently
to
the
name
of
franklin
he
a
chum
of
mine
explained
hereward
and
he
lives
close
by
so
we
made
it
up
to
come
together
his
sister
lent
us
the
clothes
and
dressed
us
i
say
your
prioress
never
found
us
out
did
she
what
about
that
prize
there
is
going
to
be
a
prize
and
you
certainly
would
have
deserved
it
look
here
you
better
wangle
yourselves
off
before
it
gets
about
who
you
are
should
get
into
a
row
not
you
would
the
prioress
kick
up
rough
she
probably
think
i
planned
the
whole
business
and
encouraged
you
to
come
even
if
we
apologized
she
would
accept
an
apology
if
you
want
me
to
have
any
tennis
next
week
you
had
better
clear
out
just
a
round
with
you
first
and
franklin
can
take
your
friend
or
vice
versa
if
you
prefer
it
you
impudent
boy
certainly
not
i
dare
risk
it
look
miss
strong
is
bringing
out
the
lamp
and
putting
it
on
the
and
i
believe
miss
perry
is
going
to
take
a
flashlight
photo
presently
if
you
want
to
disgrace
me
for
ever
we
go
sighed
a
mournful
voice
though
it
adam
and
eve
turned
out
of
paradise
i
say
franklin
they
do
want
us
after
all
our
trouble
we
better
be
getting
on
i
suppose
our
deepest
respects
to
the
prioress
she
given
us
a
delightful
evening
if
she
only
knew
it
we
like
to
come
again
some
time
chapter
xxi
the
abbey
recital
now
that
ingred
had
at
last
made
friends
with
bess
she
found
they
had
innumerable
subjects
of
interest
in
common
they
were
both
keen
tennis
players
dabbled
a
little
in
art
pursued
nature
study
liked
acting
when
they
had
any
opportunity
of
showing
their
talents
in
that
line
and
were
enthusiastic
over
music
bess
was
making
as
good
progress
on
the
violin
as
ingred
on
the
piano
so
there
seemed
great
possibilities
of
playing
together
sometimes
when
bess
brought
her
instrument
to
school
for
her
lesson
she
and
ingred
would
try
over
a
few
pieces
and
other
girls
who
chanced
to
be
near
would
collect
and
act
audience
i
vote
we
get
up
a
musical
society
next
year
suggested
ingred
impossible
this
term
we
too
much
on
our
hands
already
but
if
the
societies
are
rearranged
in
september
we
agitate
to
let
music
take
a
much
bigger
place
than
it
has
done
so
far
yes
that
would
be
glorious
agreed
bess
with
visions
of
a
school
choir
and
even
a
school
orchestra
dancing
before
her
eyes
signor
chianti
is
leaving
grovebury
so
if
we
have
a
new
violin
master
next
term
i
hope
it
will
be
somebody
who
enthusiastic
and
able
and
willing
to
organize
things
that
the
point
of
course
linton
is
very
able
but
not
willing
to
bother
with
us
beyond
our
lessons
he
so
frightfully
busy
i
suppose
he
feels
that
after
training
the
abbey
choir
and
conducting
choral
societies
to
sing
his
cantatas
he
does
care
to
trouble
himself
over
schoolgirls
he
a
musician
though
i
often
wish
i
could
study
under
him
i
love
to
play
something
with
him
just
once
to
see
how
it
feels
to
have
him
accompany
me
i
think
it
would
be
so
inspiring
it
would
just
make
one
let
oneself
go
i
stay
every
sunday
evening
after
service
at
the
abbey
to
hear
his
recitals
occasionally
somebody
plays
the
violin
and
his
accompaniment
is
simply
gorgeous
he
manages
to
make
it
sound
like
a
whole
orchestra
i
never
played
with
an
organ
it
so
much
fuller
than
a
piano
yes
agreed
ingred
contemplatively
bess
remarks
had
given
her
an
idea
but
she
did
not
want
to
communicate
it
at
once
to
her
friend
it
was
nothing
more
or
less
than
that
she
should
ask
linton
to
allow
bess
to
play
with
him
some
time
in
the
abbey
she
wondered
whether
she
dared
his
temper
was
still
decidedly
irritable
and
it
was
quite
uncertain
whether
he
would
receive
the
suggestion
graciously
or
snap
her
head
off
she
thought
however
it
was
worth
venturing
i
try
to
catch
him
in
an
amiable
mood
she
decided
in
order
not
to
arouse
any
grounds
for
irritation
she
practiced
particularly
well
and
took
her
next
work
to
him
at
a
high
stage
of
excellence
bravo
he
said
when
she
had
finished
her
serenade
i
believe
you
really
got
some
music
in
you
you
brought
out
that
crescendo
passage
very
well
indeed
we
want
a
little
more
delicacy
in
these
arpeggios
and
then
it
will
do
your
touch
has
improved
very
much
lately
it
was
so
seldom
that
her
master
launched
forth
into
praise
that
ingred
colored
with
pleasure
now
certainly
seemed
the
time
if
ever
to
put
in
a
word
for
bess
oh
linton
may
i
ask
you
to
do
something
for
me
she
blurted
out
he
thrust
back
his
hair
with
a
gesture
what
is
it
he
inquired
humorously
another
autograph
album
or
a
subscription
i
grown
cautious
by
experience
and
i
do
answer
thou
shalt
have
it
to
the
half
of
my
kingdom
i
never
give
blind
promises
it
is
an
autograph
album
though
i
be
glad
to
have
your
name
in
mine
all
the
same
if
i
may
bring
it
some
day
it
is
this
i
a
friend
at
school
bess
haselford
who
plays
the
violin
very
well
she
has
lessons
from
signor
chianti
she
goes
to
all
your
recitals
and
she
would
so
some
time
to
try
a
piece
over
with
the
organ
do
you
think
some
day
when
you
are
in
the
abbey
you
could
let
her
i
know
it
fearful
cheek
to
ask
you
why
bring
her
by
all
means
said
linton
heartily
let
me
see
i
have
an
organ
pupil
at
suppose
you
come
at
four
and
i
give
her
ten
minutes
with
pleasure
i
can
fit
it
in
before
the
choir
practice
i
dare
say
oh
thank
you
exclaimed
ingred
we
can
come
straight
on
from
school
it
was
delightful
to
have
caught
linton
in
such
an
amiable
mood
ingred
hastened
to
tell
the
good
news
to
bess
and
also
to
beg
the
necessary
permission
from
miss
burd
bess
greatly
thrilled
turned
up
next
afternoon
with
her
violin
and
and
when
classes
were
over
they
walked
across
to
the
abbey
the
pupil
was
just
finishing
his
lesson
and
some
rather
extraordinary
sounds
were
palpitating
among
the
arches
and
pillars
of
the
old
minster
it
must
take
ages
to
learn
to
manage
all
those
stops
and
pedals
properly
commented
bess
i
glad
a
violin
has
only
four
strings
they
quite
enough
they
sat
in
a
pew
and
waited
till
the
lesson
was
over
then
ventured
into
the
chancel
linton
saw
them
in
the
which
hung
over
his
seat
and
turning
round
beckoned
them
to
him
so
you
want
to
hear
what
it
like
to
play
with
an
organ
he
said
kindly
to
bess
sounding
the
notes
for
her
to
tune
her
violin
and
at
the
same
time
turning
over
her
music
what
have
we
got
here
it
must
be
something
i
know
so
that
i
can
improvise
an
accompaniment
let
us
try
this
impromptu
do
be
afraid
of
your
instrument
and
bring
the
tone
well
out
remember
you
in
a
church
and
not
in
a
bess
fluttered
nervous
but
fearfully
excited
and
pleased
declared
herself
ready
and
launched
into
the
impromptu
linton
accompanied
her
with
the
finished
skill
of
a
clever
musician
he
subdued
the
organ
just
sufficiently
to
allow
the
violin
to
lead
but
brought
in
such
a
beautiful
range
of
harmonies
that
the
piece
really
became
a
duet
why
that
capital
he
declared
at
the
conclusion
what
else
have
you
inside
that
case
we
have
this
prelude
now
it
rather
a
favorite
of
mine
the
bourrÃ©e
oh
we
take
that
afterwards
ingred
had
only
expected
linton
to
play
one
piece
with
bess
but
he
went
on
and
on
and
even
kept
the
choir
waiting
while
he
made
her
try
the
prelude
over
again
i
had
quite
an
enjoyable
he
said
shutting
the
books
at
last
you
a
sympathetic
little
player
look
here
the
lady
who
was
to
have
helped
me
with
my
recital
on
sunday
week
has
failed
me
suppose
you
take
her
place
and
play
the
prelude
it
would
go
very
well
if
we
practiced
it
a
few
times
together
play
at
the
recital
gasped
bess
why
not
ask
your
father
when
you
go
home
and
send
me
a
note
for
i
want
to
get
the
thing
fixed
up
these
boys
are
waiting
for
me
now
i
have
to
train
them
for
an
anthem
you
can
come
and
practice
with
me
on
friday
at
the
same
time
linton
dismissed
the
girls
as
if
he
took
it
entirely
for
granted
that
the
matter
was
settled
bess
was
almost
overwhelmed
by
the
proposal
it
was
considered
a
great
honor
to
play
in
the
abbey
and
she
had
never
dreamed
that
it
could
fall
to
her
lot
to
be
asked
to
take
part
in
the
sunday
recital
she
was
not
sure
how
her
father
and
mother
would
view
the
idea
but
rather
to
her
surprise
they
both
readily
acquiesced
we
shall
have
to
get
your
grandfather
to
come
over
and
hear
you
said
haselford
oh
yes
and
may
i
ask
ingred
to
stay
with
us
for
the
you
see
she
ca
come
all
the
way
from
for
sunday
recitals
and
it
entirely
owing
to
her
that
i
playing
i
should
so
like
her
to
be
there
ingred
accepted
the
invitation
with
alacrity
she
had
grown
very
fond
of
bess
lately
so
fond
indeed
that
verity
nose
was
put
considerably
out
of
joint
verity
though
an
amusing
school
comrade
was
not
a
home
friend
apart
from
fun
in
their
dormitory
she
and
ingred
had
little
in
common
and
had
never
arranged
to
spend
a
holiday
together
she
was
a
jolly
enough
girl
but
so
fond
of
ragging
that
it
was
impossible
to
do
anything
but
joke
with
her
bess
on
the
contrary
was
a
real
confidante
who
could
be
trusted
with
secrets
the
two
friends
spent
an
idyllic
saturday
together
haselford
motored
over
to
birkshaw
to
fetch
his
father
and
took
the
girls
with
him
in
the
car
haselford
the
elder
proved
a
delightful
old
gentleman
deeply
interested
in
music
and
much
gratified
that
his
was
to
play
at
the
abbey
it
was
a
happy
thought
of
yours
my
dear
he
said
to
ingred
why
i
often
attended
those
recitals
and
never
guessed
little
bess
would
be
asked
to
take
part
in
one
i
sang
in
grovebury
abbey
choir
when
i
was
a
boy
and
i
always
had
a
tender
spot
in
my
heart
for
the
old
town
and
you
not
going
to
forget
it
are
you
grandfather
said
bess
pointedly
well
well
we
shall
see
he
evaded
stroking
her
brown
hair
even
poor
delicate
haselford
made
a
supreme
effort
and
went
to
church
on
sunday
evening
it
was
a
beautiful
service
and
the
old
minster
looked
lovely
with
the
late
sunshine
streaming
through
its
gorgeous
west
window
some
of
the
congregation
went
away
after
the
sermon
and
concluding
hymn
were
over
but
a
large
number
stayed
to
hear
the
recital
bess
horribly
nervous
went
with
ingred
to
the
choir
where
she
had
left
her
violin
there
were
to
be
two
organ
solos
and
her
piece
was
to
separate
them
she
was
thankful
she
had
not
to
play
first
she
sat
on
one
of
the
old
carved
miserere
seats
and
listened
as
linton
subtle
fingers
touched
the
keys
and
flooded
the
church
with
the
rich
tones
of
bach
toccata
in
f
major
she
wished
it
had
been
five
times
as
long
so
as
to
delay
her
own
turn
but
a
solo
can
not
last
for
ever
and
much
too
soon
the
last
notes
died
away
there
was
a
pause
while
the
verger
fetched
a
music
stand
and
placed
it
close
to
the
chancel
steps
linton
was
looking
in
her
direction
and
sounding
the
a
for
her
with
her
usually
rosy
face
almost
pale
bess
walked
to
the
organ
tuned
her
violin
then
took
her
place
at
the
music
stand
it
was
seldom
that
so
young
a
girl
had
played
in
the
abbey
and
everybody
looked
sympathetically
at
the
palpably
frightened
little
figure
it
was
the
feeling
of
standing
there
facing
all
eyes
that
unnerved
poor
bess
for
a
second
or
two
her
hand
trembled
so
greatly
that
she
could
scarcely
hold
her
bow
then
by
a
sudden
inspiration
she
looked
over
the
heads
of
the
congregation
to
the
west
window
where
the
sunset
light
was
gleaming
through
figures
of
crimson
and
blue
and
gold
down
all
the
centuries
music
had
played
a
part
in
the
service
of
the
minster
she
would
not
remember
that
people
were
there
to
listen
to
her
but
would
let
her
violin
give
its
praise
to
god
alone
she
did
not
need
to
look
at
her
notes
for
she
knew
the
piece
by
heart
and
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
west
window
she
began
the
prelude
once
the
first
notes
were
started
her
courage
returned
and
she
brought
out
her
tone
with
a
firm
bow
the
splendid
harmonies
of
the
organ
supported
her
and
she
seemed
spurred
along
in
an
impulse
to
do
her
very
best
ingred
listening
in
the
choir
was
sure
her
friend
had
never
played
so
well
or
put
such
depth
of
feeling
into
her
music
before
it
was
over
at
last
and
in
the
hush
of
the
church
bess
stole
back
to
her
seat
while
linton
plunged
into
the
fantasies
of
a
triumphal
march
i
proud
of
you
whispered
ingred
as
they
walked
down
the
aisle
together
afterwards
oh
do
i
felt
as
if
it
was
half
good
enough
answered
bess
giving
a
nervous
little
shiver
now
that
the
ordeal
was
over
when
ingred
returned
to
next
friday
afternoon
she
found
the
family
had
some
news
for
her
old
haselford
had
been
to
saxon
office
and
had
confided
to
him
a
scheme
that
lay
very
near
to
his
heart
he
had
prospered
exceedingly
in
his
business
affairs
at
birkshaw
and
he
was
anxious
to
do
something
for
his
native
town
of
grovebury
where
he
had
been
born
and
had
spent
his
boyhood
he
asked
saxon
to
prepare
designs
for
a
combined
museum
and
art
gallery
which
he
proposed
to
build
and
present
to
the
public
i
can
trust
the
architect
of
to
give
us
something
in
the
best
possible
taste
he
had
remarked
i
want
the
place
to
be
an
object
of
beauty
not
the
blot
on
the
landscape
that
such
buildings
often
prove
fortunately
i
have
the
offer
of
a
splendid
site
so
the
plans
need
not
be
hampered
by
lack
of
space
i
think
we
shall
be
able
to
show
that
the
twentieth
century
can
produce
work
of
merit
on
its
own
lines
without
slavishly
copying
either
the
classical
or
the
mediÃ¦val
style
of
architecture
old
haselford
had
even
gone
further
my
son
part
of
the
business
is
now
entirely
at
grovebury
he
continued
and
i
feel
i
should
like
him
to
have
a
house
of
his
own
i
have
bought
five
acres
of
land
above
the
river
at
trenton
on
the
hill
where
there
is
a
glorious
view
of
the
valley
i
do
ask
you
to
copy
for
i
know
no
architect
cares
to
repeat
himself
but
a
place
in
the
same
style
and
with
equal
conveniences
would
suit
us
very
well
my
could
talk
over
the
details
it
would
make
a
fresh
interest
for
her
we
are
all
tremendously
keen
about
it
the
new
schemes
which
occupied
the
minds
of
the
haselfords
brought
great
rejoicings
to
the
bungalow
why
it
will
almost
make
father
fortune
triumphed
ingred
still
in
a
state
of
delighted
bewilderment
it
will
certainly
be
an
immense
pull
to
him
professionally
to
have
the
designing
of
an
important
public
building
smiled
mother
and
i
think
he
will
be
able
to
plan
a
house
to
satisfy
and
haselford
just
the
kind
of
work
he
likes
mother
when
they
leave
rotherwood
shall
we
have
to
let
it
to
any
one
else
or
would
it
be
possible
ingred
hesitated
with
the
wish
that
for
nearly
a
year
she
had
put
resolutely
away
from
her
trembling
on
her
lips
to
go
back
there
ourselves
finished
mother
if
father
affairs
prosper
as
they
seem
likely
to
do
at
present
i
think
we
may
safely
say
it
never
rains
but
it
pours
and
just
as
his
profession
has
suddenly
taken
a
leap
forward
his
private
investments
have
picked
up
colonial
mines
that
he
thought
utterly
done
for
have
begun
to
work
again
and
pay
dividends
our
prospects
now
are
very
different
indeed
from
what
they
were
a
few
months
ago
do
look
too
excited
ingred
houses
take
a
long
time
to
build
nowadays
and
it
may
be
years
before
haselford
new
place
is
finished
and
we
can
get
of
rotherwood
i
do
care
so
long
as
there
hope
of
ever
having
it
again
it
our
own
home
and
naturally
we
love
it
but
we
must
not
forget
what
a
debt
of
gratitude
we
owe
to
the
bungalow
we
have
been
very
happy
here
and
i
think
we
have
been
thrown
together
and
have
learnt
to
know
one
another
in
a
way
we
should
never
have
done
at
rotherwood
all
the
sacrifices
we
have
made
for
each
other
have
drawn
us
far
closer
as
a
family
and
linked
us
up
so
that
we
ought
never
to
be
able
to
drift
apart
now
which
might
have
happened
if
we
had
all
been
able
just
to
pursue
our
own
line
we
have
learnt
the
value
here
of
simple
pleasures
we
enjoyed
the
moors
and
the
flowers
and
the
birds
and
the
stars
and
all
the
beautiful
things
that
nature
can
give
us
the
realization
of
them
is
worth
far
more
than
anything
that
money
can
buy
for
it
the
that
no
man
taketh
from
you
i
have
grown
to
love
so
dearly
that
i
shall
beg
father
to
keep
on
the
bungalow
as
a
country
cottage
and
i
shall
run
out
here
for
holidays
when
i
feel
rotherwood
is
too
much
for
me
and
i
want
to
be
alone
for
a
while
with
nature
i
expect
we
all
want
to
do
just
the
same
said
quenrede
looking
from
the
gay
which
her
own
hands
had
planted
over
the
hedge
to
where
the
brown
moors
stretched
away
into
the
dim
gray
of
the
distance
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
hateful
when
i
came
here
but
muvvie
i
think
it
been
the
happiest
year
of
my
life
the
country
may
be
quiet
but
it
has
its
compensation
we
walk
to
the
whistling
stones
again
ingred
as
soon
as
you
break
up
and
that
will
be
exactly
a
week
next
friday
rejoiced
ingred
the
school
was
busy
with
all
the
usual
activities
that
seem
to
happen
at
the
end
of
the
summer
term
there
was
a
successful
cricket
match
with
the
girls
high
school
from
birkshaw
a
tennis
tournament
where
nora
and
susie
took
part
after
all
and
won
laurels
for
the
college
a
nature
notebook
competition
in
which
linda
to
every
one
amazement
bore
off
the
first
prize
against
all
other
schools
in
the
town
then
there
was
the
annual
function
when
parents
were
invited
to
see
a
display
of
swedish
drill
listen
to
songs
given
by
the
singing
class
admire
the
drawings
and
clay
models
exhibited
in
the
studio
and
watch
a
french
play
acted
by
the
sixth
it
was
at
the
close
of
this
performance
that
when
friends
had
taken
their
departure
and
linton
who
had
conducted
the
singing
class
had
closed
the
grand
piano
and
had
hurried
across
to
the
abbey
to
keep
an
appointment
with
an
organ
pupil
a
certain
piece
of
news
leaked
out
and
began
to
circulate
round
the
school
verity
had
the
proud
importance
of
carrying
it
into
the
hostel
do
you
know
she
announced
that
miss
strong
is
engaged
to
linton
and
they
to
be
married
in
the
holidays
nora
who
was
changing
a
crÃªpe
de
chine
dress
for
a
serviceable
tennis
costume
collapsed
on
to
her
bed
hold
me
up
she
murmured
dramatically
why
i
did
know
he
was
a
widower
of
course
he
is
endorsed
ingred
and
a
most
uncomfortable
one
i
should
say
i
went
to
his
house
once
for
a
music
lesson
and
it
looked
in
a
fearful
muddle
good
old
bantam
we
must
give
her
congrats
soon
get
things
into
order
there
i
believe
she
adores
little
kenneth
i
often
seen
her
taking
him
about
the
town
she
shall
have
my
blessing
by
all
means
we
might
give
her
something
more
substantial
than
congrats
and
blessings
suggested
verity
i
vote
we
get
up
a
subscription
in
the
form
for
a
decent
wedding
present
oh
yes
think
of
sarkie
as
linton
they
be
the
oddest
couple
i
wonder
if
she
get
tired
of
perpetual
music
and
if
he
rage
round
his
own
and
ruffle
his
hair
when
he
feels
annoyed
like
he
does
with
his
pupils
perhaps
she
break
him
off
bad
habits
i
could
trust
her
to
hold
her
own
oh
she
be
the
gray
mare
do
you
fear
but
honestly
i
glad
she
has
her
points
and
i
hope
she
be
happy
i
wonder
who
have
her
form
next
term
that
does
concern
us
for
we
shall
probably
be
in
the
sixth
help
so
we
shall
i
ca
bring
my
mind
to
it
yet
it
gives
me
spasms
quite
a
blossomy
prospect
though
on
the
afternoon
before
day
the
school
parliament
met
for
the
last
time
lispeth
rather
sad
and
inclined
to
be
sentimental
reviewed
from
the
chair
the
events
of
the
past
year
it
has
been
pioneer
work
she
said
i
dare
say
we
might
have
done
it
better
but
at
least
we
tried
we
laid
ourselves
out
to
set
a
standard
for
the
tone
of
the
school
and
i
think
it
has
kept
up
fairly
well
on
the
whole
the
rainbow
league
seems
thoroughly
established
and
likely
to
go
on
may
i
read
you
some
of
the
things
it
has
done
during
the
year
we
made
four
pounds
for
the
fund
and
sent
toys
to
poor
children
treats
the
posy
union
gave
nine
pots
of
crocuses
and
bunches
of
flowers
to
cripples
and
invalids
the
subscriptions
have
kept
two
little
girls
all
the
summer
at
the
children
camp
and
the
needlework
guild
has
made
garments
it
does
sound
much
when
you
put
it
all
in
hard
black
and
white
like
that
i
hate
reports
and
statistics
of
societies
they
always
sound
to
me
somehow
so
pharisaical
as
if
we
were
saying
how
good
we
are
you
know
i
do
mean
that
what
i
mean
though
is
that
we
tried
not
to
run
everything
entirely
for
ourselves
a
rainbow
shines
when
the
world
is
clearing
up
and
perhaps
our
little
efforts
small
as
they
are
show
that
things
are
moving
in
the
right
direction
next
term
all
of
us
girls
in
the
sixth
will
have
left
and
a
new
set
will
take
the
lead
i
ca
say
yet
who
will
be
head
of
the
school
but
i
do
fancy
there
very
much
doubt
about
it
i
hope
whoever
has
the
reins
will
keep
up
what
we
have
worked
so
hard
for
this
year
lispeth
was
looking
straight
at
ingred
as
she
spoke
her
meaning
was
unmistakable
ingred
blushed
a
faint
rosy
pink
it
had
only
just
dawned
upon
her
that
next
term
would
possibly
bring
her
the
greatest
honor
that
the
college
had
to
confer
whoever
is
chosen
for
she
stammered
bashfully
i
sure
will
try
her
very
best
to
work
for
the
good
of
the
school
she
do
more
than
you
done
probably
she
wo
do
half
so
well
but
make
an
enormous
effort
to
shall
we
say
just
on
