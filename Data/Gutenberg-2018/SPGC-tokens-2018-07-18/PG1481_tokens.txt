comtesse

nee
vimercati
if
you
remember
madame
the
pleasure
your
conversation
gave
to
a
traveller
by
recalling
paris
to
his
memory
in
milan
you
will
not
be
surprised
to
find
him
testifying
his
gratitude
for
many
pleasant
evenings
passed
beside
you
by
laying
one
of
his
works
at
your
feet
and
begging
you
to
protect
it
with
your
name
as
in
former
days
that
name
protected
the
tales
of
an
ancient
writer
dear
to
the
milanese
you
have
an
eugenie
already
beautiful
whose
intelligent
smile
gives
promise
that
she
has
inherited
from
you
the
most
precious
gifts
of
womanhood
and
who
will
certainly
enjoy
during
her
childhood
and
youth
all
those
happinesses
which
a
rigid
mother
denied
to
the
eugenie
of
these
pages
though
frenchmen
are
taxed
with
inconstancy
you
will
find
me
italian
in
faithfulness
and
memory
while
writing
the
name
of
eugenie
my
thoughts
have
often
led
me
back
to
that
cool
stuccoed
salon
and
little
garden
in
the
vicolo
dei
cappucini
which
echoed
to
the
laughter
of
that
dear
child
to
our
sportive
quarrels
and
our
chatter
but
you
have
left
the
corso
for
the
tre
monasteri
and
i
know
not
how
you
are
placed
there
consequently
i
am
forced
to
think
of
you
not
among
the
charming
things
with
which
no
doubt
you
have
surrounded
yourself
but
like
one
of
those
fine
figures
due
to
raffaelle
titian
correggio
allori
which
seem
abstractions
so
distant
are
they
from
our
daily
lives
if
this
book
should
wing
its
way
across
the
alps
it
will
prove
to
you
the
lively
gratitude
and
respectful
friendship
of
your
devoted
servant

i
the
two
maries
in
one
of
the
finest
houses
of
the
rue
at
eleven
at
night
two
young
women
were
sitting
before
the
fireplace
of
a
boudoir
hung
with
blue
velvet
of
that
tender
shade
with
shimmering
reflections
which
french
industry
has
lately
learned
to
fabricate
over
the
doors
and
windows
were
draped
soft
folds
of
blue
cashmere
the
tint
of
the
hangings
the
work
of
one
of
those
upholsterers
who
have
just
missed
being
artists
a
silver
lamp
studded
with
turquoise
and
suspended
by
chains
of
beautiful
workmanship
hung
from
the
centre
of
the
ceiling
the
same
system
of
decoration
was
followed
in
the
smallest
details
and
even
to
the
ceiling
of
fluted
blue
silk
with
long
bands
of
white
cashmere
falling
at
equal
distances
on
the
hangings
where
they
were
caught
back
by
ropes
of
pearl
a
warm
belgian
carpet
thick
as
turf
of
a
gray
ground
with
blue
posies
covered
the
floor
the
furniture
of
carved
ebony
after
a
fine
model
of
the
old
school
gave
substance
and
richness
to
the
rather
too
decorative
quality
as
a
painter
might
call
it
of
the
rest
of
the
room
on
either
side
of
a
large
window
two
etageres
displayed
a
hundred
precious
trifles

of
mechanical
art
brought
into
bloom
by
the
fire

a
of

in

garb
with
delicate

surrounding
a

inlaid
with

the
brilliant
facets
of

framed
in

with

from

former

filled
with
the
exotic
product
of
a
pale
but
divine
flowers
the
treasures
of
botany
in
this
cold
orderly
boudoir
where
all
things
were
in
place
as
if
for
sale
no
sign
existed
of
the
gay
and
capricious
disorder
of
a
happy
home
at
the
present
moment

two
young
women

weeping
pain
seemed
to
predominate
the
name
of
the
owner
ferdinand
du
tillet
one
of
the
richest
bankers
in
paris
is
enough
to
explain
the
luxury
of
the
whole
house
of
which
this
boudoir
is
but
a
sample
though
without
either
rank
or
station
having
pushed
himself
forward
heaven
knows
how
du
tillet
had
married
in
the
daughter
of
the
comte
de
granville
one
of
the
greatest
names
in
the
french
magistracy
a
man
who
became
peer
of
france
after
the
revolution
of
july
this
marriage
of
ambition
on
du
tillet
s
part
was
brought
about
by
his
agreeing
to
sign
an
acknowledgment
in
the
marriage
contract
of
a
dowry
not
received
equal
to
that
of
her
elder
sister
who
was
married
to
comte
felix
de
vandenesse
on
the
other
hand
the
granvilles
obtained
the
alliance
with
de
vandenesse
by
the
largeness
of
the
thus
the
bank
repaired
the
breach
made
in
the
pocket
of
the
magistracy
by
rank
could
the
comte
de
vandenesse
have
seen
himself
three
years
later
the
of
a
sieur
ferdinand
du
tillet
he
might
not
have
married
his
wife
but
what
man
of
rank
in
foresaw
the
strange
upheavals
which
the
year
was
destined
to
produce
in
the
political
condition
the
fortunes
and
the
customs
of
france
had
any
one
predicted
to
comte
felix
de
vandenesse
that
his
head
would
lose
the
coronet
of
a
peer
and
that
of
his
acquire
one
he
would
have
thought
his
informant
a
lunatic
bending
forward
on
one
of
those
low
chairs
then
called
chaffeuses
in
the
attitude
of
a
listener
madame
du
tillet
was
pressing
to
her
bosom
with
maternal
tenderness
and
occasionally
kissing
the
hand
of
her
sister
madame
felix
de
vandenesse
society
added
the
baptismal
name
to
the
surname
in
order
to
distinguish
the
countess
from
her
the
marquise
charles
de
vandenesse
wife
of
the
former
ambassador
who
had
married
the
widow
of
the
comte
de
kergarouet
mademoiselle
emilie
de
fontaine
half
lying
on
a
sofa
her
handkerchief
in
the
other
hand
her
breathing
choked
by
repressed
sobs
and
with
tearful
eyes
the
countess
had
been
making
confidences
such
as
are
made
only
from
sister
to
sister
when
two
sisters
love
each
other
and
these
two
sisters
did
love
each
other
tenderly
we
live
in
days
when
sisters
married
into
such
antagonist
spheres
can
very
well
not
love
each
other
and
therefore
the
historian
is
bound
to
relate
the
reasons
of
this
tender
affection
preserved
without
spot
or
jar
in
spite
of
their
husbands
contempt
for
each
other
and
their
own
social
disunion
a
rapid
glance
at
their
childhood
will
explain
the
situation
brought
up
in
a
gloomy
house
in
the
marais
by
a
woman
of
narrow
mind
a
devote
who
being
sustained
by
a
sense
of
duty
sacred
phrase
had
fulfilled
her
tasks
as
a
mother
religiously
and
marie
eugenie
de
granville
reached
the
period
of
their
marriage
the
first
at
eighteen
the
second
at
twenty
years
of
age
without
ever
leaving
the
domestic
zone
where
the
rigid
maternal
eye
controlled
them
up
to
that
time
they
had
never
been
to
a
play
the
churches
of
paris
were
their
theatre
their
education
in
their
mother
s
house
had
been
as
rigorous
as
it
would
have
been
in
a
convent
from
infancy
they
had
slept
in
a
room
adjoining
that
of
the
comtesse
de
granville
the
door
of
which
stood
always
open
the
time
not
occupied
by
the
care
of
their
persons
their
religious
duties
and
the
studies
considered
necessary
for
young
ladies
was
spent
in
needlework
done
for
the
poor
or
in
walks
like
those
an
englishwoman
allows
herself
on
sunday
saying
apparently
not
so
fast
or
we
shall
seem
to
be
amusing
their
education
did
not
go
beyond
the
limits
imposed
by
confessors
who
were
chosen
by
their
mother
from
the
strictest
and
least
tolerant
of
the
jansenist
priests
never
were
girls
delivered
over
to
their
husbands
more
absolutely
pure
and
virgin
than
they
their
mother
seemed
to
consider
that
point
essential
as
indeed
it
is
the
accomplishment
of
all
her
duties
toward
earth
and
heaven
these
two
poor
creatures
had
never
before
their
marriage
read
a
tale
or
heard
of
a
romance
their
very
drawings
were
of
figures
whose
anatomy
would
have
been
masterpieces
of
the
impossible
to
cuvier
designed
to
feminize
the
farnese
hercules
himself
an
old
maid
taught
them
drawing
a
worthy
priest
instructed
them
in
grammar
the
french
language
history
geography
and
the
very
little
arithmetic
it
was
thought
necessary
in
their
rank
for
women
to
know
their
reading
selected
from
authorized
books
such
as
the
lettres
edifiantes
and
noel
s
lecons
de
litterature
was
done
aloud
in
the
evening
but
always
in
presence
of
their
mother
s
confessor
for
even
in
those
books
there
did
sometimes
occur
passages
which
without
wise
comments
might
have
roused
their
imagination
fenelon
s
telemaque
was
thought
dangerous
the
comtesse
de
granville
loved
her
daughters
sufficiently
to
wish
to
make
them
angels
after
the
pattern
of
marie
alacoque
but
the
poor
girls
themselves
would
have
preferred
a
less
virtuous
and
more
amiable
mother
this
education
bore
its
natural
fruits
religion
imposed
as
a
yoke
and
presented
under
its
sternest
aspect
wearied
with
formal
practice
these
innocent
young
hearts
treated
as
sinful
it
repressed
their
feelings
and
was
never
precious
to
them
although
it
struck
its
roots
deep
down
into
their
natures
under
such
training
the
two
maries
would
either
have
become
mere
imbeciles
or
they
must
necessarily
have
longed
for
independence
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
they
looked
to
marriage
as
soon
as
they
saw
anything
of
life
and
were
able
to
compare
a
few
ideas
of
their
own
tender
graces
and
their
personal
value
they
were
absolutely
ignorant
they
were
ignorant
too
of
their
own
innocence
how
then
could
they
know
life
without
weapons
to
meet
misfortune
without
experience
to
appreciate
happiness
they
found
no
comfort
in
the
maternal
jail
all
their
joys
were
in
each
other
their
tender
confidences
at
night
in
whispers
or
a
few
short
sentences
exchanged
if
their
mother
left
them
for
a
moment
contained
more
ideas
than
the
words
themselves
expressed
often
a
glance
concealed
from
other
eyes
by
which
they
conveyed
to
each
other
their
emotions
was
like
a
poem
of
bitter
melancholy
the
sight
of
a
cloudless
sky
the
fragrance
of
flowers
a
turn
in
the
garden
arm
in
arm
these
were
their
joys
the
finishing
of
a
piece
of
embroidery
was
to
them
a
source
of
enjoyment
their
mother
s
social
circle
far
from
opening
resources
to
their
hearts
or
stimulating
their
minds
only
darkened
their
ideas
and
depressed
them
it
was
made
up
of
rigid
old
women
withered
and
graceless
whose
conversation
turned
on
the
differences
which
distinguished
various
preachers
and
confessors
on
their
own
petty
indispositions
on
religious
events
insignificant
even
to
the
quotidienne
or
l
ami
de
la
as
for
the
men
who
appeared
in
the
comtesse
de
granville
s
salon
they
extinguished
any
possible
torch
of
love
so
cold
and
sadly
resigned
were
their
faces
they
were
all
of
an
age
when
mankind
is
sulky
and
fretful
and
natural
sensibilities
are
chiefly
exercised
at
table
and
on
the
things
relating
to
personal
comfort
religious
egotism
had
long
dried
up
those
hearts
devoted
to
narrow
duties
and
entrenched
behind
pious
practices
silent
games
of
cards
occupied
the
whole
evening
and
the
two
young
girls
under
the
ban
of
that
sanhedrim
enforced
by
maternal
severity
came
to
hate
the
dispiriting
personages
about
them
with
their
hollow
eyes
and
scowling
faces
on
the
gloom
of
this
life
one
sole
figure
of
a
man
that
of
a
stood
vigorously
forth
the
confessors
had
decided
that
music
was
a
christian
art
born
of
the
catholic
church
and
developed
within
her
the
two
maries
were
therefore
permitted
to
study
music
a
spinster
in
spectacles
who
taught
singing
and
the
piano
in
a
neighboring
convent
wearied
them
with
exercises
but
when
the
eldest
girl
was
ten
years
old
the
comte
de
granville
insisted
on
the
importance
of
giving
her
a
master
madame
de
granville
gave
all
the
value
of
conjugal
obedience
to
this
needed
concession
it
is
part
of
a
devote
s
character
to
make
a
merit
of
doing
her
duty
the
master
was
a
catholic
german
one
of
those
men
born
old
who
seem
all
their
lives
fifty
years
of
age
even
at
eighty
and
yet
his
brown
sunken
wrinkled
face
still
kept
something
infantile
and
artless
in
its
dark
creases
the
blue
of
innocence
was
in
his
eyes
and
a
gay
smile
of
springtide
abode
upon
his
lips
his
hair
falling
naturally
like
that
of
the
christ
in
art
added
to
his
ecstatic
air
a
certain
solemnity
which
was
absolutely
deceptive
as
to
his
real
nature
for
he
was
capable
of
committing
any
silliness
with
the
most
exemplary
gravity
his
clothes
were
a
necessary
envelope
to
which
he
paid
not
the
slightest
attention
for
his
eyes
looked
too
high
among
the
clouds
to
concern
themselves
with
such
materialities
this
great
unknown
artist
belonged
to
the
kindly
class
of
the
who
give
their
time
and
their
soul
to
others
just
as
they
leave
their
gloves
on
every
table
and
their
umbrella
at
all
doors
his
hands
were
of
the
kind
that
are
dirty
as
soon
as
washed
in
short
his
old
body
badly
poised
on
its
knotted
old
legs
proving
to
what
degree
a
man
can
make
it
the
mere
accessory
of
his
soul
belonged
to
those
strange
creations
which
have
been
properly
depicted
only
by
a
german
by
hoffman
the
poet
of
that
which
seems
not
to
exist
but
yet
has
life
such
was
schmucke
formerly
to
the
margrave
of
anspach
a
musical
genius
who
was
now
examined
by
a
council
of
devotes
and
asked
if
he
kept
the
fasts
the
master
was
much
inclined
to
answer
look
at
me
but
how
could
he
venture
to
joke
with
pious
dowagers
and
jansenist
confessors
this
apocryphal
old
fellow
held
such
a
place
in
the
lives
of
the
two
maries
they
felt
such
friendship
for
the
grand
and
artist
who
was
happy
and
contented
in
the
mere
comprehension
of
his
art
that
after
their
marriage
they
each
gave
him
an
annuity
of
three
hundred
francs
a
year
a
sum
which
sufficed
to
pay
for
his
lodging
beer
pipes
and
clothes
six
hundred
francs
a
year
and
his
lessons
put
him
in
eden
schmucke
had
never
found
courage
to
confide
his
poverty
and
his
aspirations
to
any
but
these
two
adorable
young
girls
whose
hearts
were
blooming
beneath
the
snow
of
maternal
rigor
and
the
ice
of
devotion
this
fact
explains
schmucke
and
the
girlhood
of
the
two
maries
no
one
knew
then
or
later
what
abbe
or
pious
spinster
had
discovered
the
old
german
then
vaguely
wandering
about
paris
but
as
soon
as
mothers
of
families
learned
that
the
comtesse
de
granville
had
found
a
for
her
daughters
they
all
inquired
for
his
name
and
address
before
long
schmucke
had
thirty
pupils
in
the
marais
this
tardy
success
was
manifested
by
steel
buckles
to
his
shoes
which
were
lined
with
soles
and
by
a
more
frequent
change
of
linen
his
artless
gaiety
long
suppressed
by
noble
and
decent
poverty
reappeared
he
gave
vent
to
witty
little
remarks
and
flowery
speeches
in
his
patois
very
observing
and
very
quaint
and
said
with
an
air
which
disarmed
ridicule
but
he
was
so
pleased
to
bring
a
laugh
to
the
lips
of
his
two
pupils
whose
dismal
life
his
sympathy
had
penetrated
that
he
would
gladly
have
made
himself
wilfully
ridiculous
had
he
failed
in
being
so
by
nature
according
to
one
of
the
nobler
ideas
of
religious
education
the
young
girls
always
accompanied
their
master
respectfully
to
the
door
there
they
would
make
him
a
few
kind
speeches
glad
to
do
anything
to
give
him
pleasure
poor
things
all
they
could
do
was
to
show
him
their
womanhood
until
their
marriage
music
was
to
them
another
life
within
their
lives
just
as
they
say
a
russian
peasant
takes
his
dreams
for
reality
and
his
actual
life
for
a
troubled
sleep
with
the
instinct
of
protecting
their
souls
against
the
pettiness
that
threatened
to
overwhelm
them
against
the
asceticism
of
their
home
they
flung
themselves
into
the
difficulties
of

whose

was

by

old

faun
drunk
with
music
were
to
these
poor
girls
the
compensation
of
their
trials
they
made
them
as
it
were
a
rampart
against
their
daily
lives
mozart

and
certain

geniuses
developed
in
their
souls
a
passionate
emotion
which
never
passed
beyond
the
chaste
enclosure
of
their
breasts
though
it
permeated
that
other
creation
through
which
in
spirit
they
winged
their
flight
when
they
had
executed
some
great
work
in
a
manner
that
their
master
declared
was
almost
faultless
they
embraced
each
other
in
ecstasy
and
the
old
man
called
them
his
saint
cecilias
the
two
maries
were
not
taken
to
a
ball
until
they
were
sixteen
years
of
age
and
then
only
four
times
a
year
in
special
houses
they
were
not
allowed
to
leave
their
mother
s
side
without
instructions
as
to
their
behavior
with
their
partners
and
so
severe
were
those
instructions
that
they
dared
say
only
yes
or
no
during
a
dance
the
eye
of
the
countess
never
left
them
and
she
seemed
to
know
from
the
mere
movement
of
their
lips
the
words
they
uttered
even
the
of
these
poor
little
things
were
piously
irreproachable
their
muslin
gowns
came
up
to
their
chins
with
an
endless
number
of
thick
ruches
and
the
sleeves
came
down
to
their
wrists
swathing
in
this
way
their
natural
charms
this
costume
gave
them
a
vague
resemblance
to
egyptian
hermae
though
from
these
blocks
of
muslin
rose
enchanting
little
heads
of
tender
melancholy
they
felt
themselves
the
objects
of
pity
and
inwardly
resented
it
what
woman
however
innocent
does
not
desire
to
excite
envy
no
dangerous
idea
unhealthy
or
even
equivocal
soiled
the
pure
pulp
of
their
brain
their
hearts
were
innocent
their
hands
were
horribly
red
and
they
glowed
with
health
eve
did
not
issue
more
innocent
from
the
hands
of
god
than
these
two
girls
from
their
mother
s
home
when
they
went
to
the
mayor
s
office
and
the
church
to
be
married
after
receiving
the
simple
but
terrible
injunction
to
obey
in
all
things
two
men
with
whom
they
were
henceforth
to
live
and
sleep
by
day
and
by
night
to
their
minds
nothing
could
be
worse
in
the
strange
houses
where
they
were
to
go
than
the
maternal
convent
why
did
the
father
of
these
poor
girls
the
comte
de
granville
a
wise
and
upright
magistrate
though
sometimes
led
away
by
politics
refrain
from
protecting
the
helpless
little
creatures
from
such
crushing
despotism
alas
by
mutual
understanding
about
ten
years
after
marriage
he
and
his
wife
were
separated
while
living
under
one
roof
the
father
had
taken
upon
himself
the
education
of
his
sons
leaving
that
of
the
daughters
to
his
wife
he
saw
less
danger
for
women
than
for
men
in
the
application
of
his
wife
s
oppressive
system
the
two
maries
destined
as
women
to
endure
tyranny
either
of
love
or
marriage
would
be
he
thought
less
injured
than
boys
whose
minds
ought
to
have
freer
play
and
whose
manly
qualities
would
deteriorate
under
the
powerful
compression
of
religious
ideas
pushed
to
their
utmost
consequences
of
four
victims
the
count
saved
two
the
countess
regarded
her
sons
as
too
to
admit
of
the
slightest
intimacy
with
their
sisters
all
communication
between
the
poor
children
was
therefore
strictly
watched
when
the
boys
came
home
from
school
the
count
was
careful
not
to
keep
them
in
the
house
the
boys
always
breakfasted
with
their
mother
and
sisters
but
after
that
the
count
took
them
off
to
museums
theatres
restaurants
or
during
the
summer
season
into
the
country
except
on
the
solemn
days
of
some
family
festival
such
as
the
countess
s
birthday
or
new
year
s
day
or
the
day
of
the
distribution
of
prizes
when
the
boys
remained
in
their
father
s
house
and
slept
there
the
sisters
saw
so
little
of
their
brothers
that
there
was
absolutely
no
tie
between
them
on
those
days
the
countess
never
left
them
for
an
instant
alone
together
calls
of
where
is
angelique
what
is
eugenie
about
where
are
my
daughters
resounded
all
day
as
for
the
mother
s
sentiments
towards
her
sons
the
countess
raised
to
heaven
her
cold
and
macerated
eyes
as
if
to
ask
pardon
of
god
for
not
having
snatched
them
from
iniquity
her
exclamations
and
also
her
reticences
on
the
subject
of
her
sons
were
equal
to
the
most
lamenting
verses
in
jeremiah
and
completely
deceived
the
sisters
who
supposed
their
sinful
brothers
to
be
doomed
to
perdition
when
the
boys
were
eighteen
years
of
age
the
count
gave
them
rooms
in
his
own
part
of
the
house
and
sent
them
to
study
law
under
the
supervision
of
a
solicitor
his
former
secretary
the
two
maries
knew
nothing
therefore
of
fraternity
except
by
theory
at
the
time
of
the
marriage
of
the
sisters
both
brothers
were
practising
in
provincial
courts
and
both
were
detained
by
important
cases
domestic
life
in
many
families
which
might
be
expected
to
be
intimate
united
and
homogeneous
is
really
spent
in
this
way
brothers
are
sent
to
a
distance
busy
with
their
own
careers
their
own
advancement
occupied
perhaps
about
the
good
of
the
country
the
sisters
are
engrossed
in
a
round
of
other
interests
all
the
members
of
such
a
family
live
disunited
forgetting
one
another
bound
together
only
by
some
feeble
tie
of
memory
until
perhaps
a
sentiment
of
pride
or
either
joins
them
or
separates
them
in
heart
as
they
already
are
in
fact
modern
laws
by
multiplying
the
family
by
the
family
has
created
a
great
evil
namely
individualism
in
the
depths
of
this
solitude
where
their
girlhood
was
spent
angelique
and
eugenie
seldom
saw
their
father
and
when
he
did
enter
the
grand
apartment
of
his
wife
on
the
first
floor
he
brought
with
him
a
saddened
face
in
his
own
home
he
always
wore
the
grave
and
solemn
look
of
a
magistrate
on
the
bench
when
the
little
girls
had
passed
the
age
of
dolls
and
toys
when
they
began
about
twelve
to
use
their
minds
an
epoch
at
which
they
ceased
to
laugh
at
schmucke
they
divined
the
secret
of
the
cares
that
lined
their
father
s
forehead
and
they
recognized
beneath
that
mask
of
sternness
the
relics
of
a
kind
heart
and
a
fine
character
they
vaguely
perceived
how
he
had
yielded
to
the
forces
of
religion
in
his
household
disappointed
as
he
was
in
his
hopes
of
a
husband
and
wounded
in
the
tenderest
fibres
of
paternity
the
love
of
a
father
for
his
daughters
such
griefs
were
singularly
moving
to
the
hearts
of
the
two
young
girls
who
were
themselves
deprived
of
all
tenderness
sometimes
when
pacing
the
garden
between
his
daughters
with
an
arm
round
each
little
waist
and
stepping
with
their
own
short
steps
the
father
would
stop
short
behind
a
clump
of
trees
out
of
sight
of
the
house
and
kiss
them
on
their
foreheads
his
eyes
his
lips
his
whole
countenance
expressing
the
deepest
commiseration
you
are
not
very
happy
my
dear
little
girls
he
said
one
day
but
i
shall
marry
you
early
it
will
comfort
me
to
have
you
leave
papa
said
eugenie
we
have
decided
to
take
the
first
man
who
ah
he
cried
that
is
the
bitter
fruit
of
such
a
system
they
want
to
make
saints
and
they
make
he
stopped
without
ending
his
sentence
often
the
two
girls
felt
an
infinite
tenderness
in
their
father
s
adieu
or
in
his
eyes
when
by
chance
he
dined
at
home
they
pitied
that
father
so
seldom
seen
and
love
follows
often
upon
pity
this
stern
and
rigid
education
was
the
cause
of
the
marriages
of
the
two
sisters
welded
together
by
misfortune
as
by
the
hand
of
nature
many
men
driven
to
marriage
prefer
a
girl
taken
from
a
convent
and
saturated
with
piety
to
a
girl
brought
up
to
worldly
ideas
there
seems
to
be
no
middle
course
a
man
must
marry
either
an
educated
girl
who
reads
the
newspapers
and
comments
upon
them
who
waltzes
with
a
dozen
young
men
goes
to
the
theatre
devours
novels
cares
nothing
for
religion
and
makes
her
own
ethics
or
an
ignorant
and
innocent
young
girl
like
either
of
the
two
maries
perhaps
there
may
be
as
much
danger
with
the
one
kind
as
with
the
other
yet
the
vast
majority
of
men
who
are
not
so
old
as
arnolphe
prefer
a
religious
agnes
to
a
budding
celimene
the
two
maries
who
were
small
and
slender
had
the
same
figure
the
same
foot
the
same
hand
eugenie
the
younger
was
like
her
mother
angelique
was
like
the
father
but
they
both
had
the
same
complexion
a
skin
of
the
pearly
whiteness
which
shows
the
richness
and
purity
of
the
blood
where
the
color
rises
through
a
tissue
like
that
of
the
jasmine
soft
smooth
and
tender
to
the
touch
eugenie
s
blue
eyes
and
the
brown
eyes
of
angelique
had
an
expression
of
artless
indifference
of
ingenuous
surprise
which
was
rendered
by
the
vague
manner
with
which
the
pupils
floated
on
the
fluid
whiteness
of
the
eyeball
they
were
both
the
rather
thin
shoulders
would
develop
later
their
throats
long
veiled
delighted
the
eye
when
their
husbands
requested
them
to
wear
low
dresses
to
a
ball
on
which
occasion
they
both
felt
a
pleasing
shame
which
made
them
first
blush
behind
closed
doors
and
afterwards
through
a
whole
evening
in
company
on
the
occasion
when
this
scene
opens
and
the
eldest
angelique
was
weeping
while
the
younger
eugenie
was
consoling
her
their
hands
and
arms
were
white
as
milk
each
had
nursed
a
child
one
a
boy
the
other
a
daughter
eugenie
as
a
girl
was
thought
very
giddy
by
her
mother
who
had
therefore
treated
her
with
especial
watchfulness
and
severity
in
the
eyes
of
that
mother
angelique
noble
and
proud
appeared
to
have
a
soul
so
lofty
that
it
would
guard
itself
whereas
the
more
lively
eugenie
needed
restraint
there
are
many
charming
beings
misused
by
fate
beings
who
ought
by
rights
to
prosper
in
this
life
but
who
live
and
die
unhappy
tortured
by
some
evil
genius
the
victims
of
unfortunate
circumstances
the
innocent
and
naturally
eugenie
had
fallen
into
the
hands
and
beneath
the
malicious
despotism
of
a
man
on
leaving
the
maternal
prison
angelique
whose
nature
inclined
her
to
deeper
sentiments
was
thrown
into
the
upper
spheres
of
parisian
social
life
with
the
bridle
lying
loose
upon
her
neck
chapter
ii
a
confidence
between
sisters
madame
de
vandenesse
who
seemed
to
have
broken
down
under
a
weight
of
troubles
too
heavy
for
her
soul
to
bear
was
lying
back
on
the
sofa
with
bent
limbs
and
her
head
tossing
restlessly
she
had
rushed
to
her
sister
s
house
after
a
brief
appearance
at
the
opera
flowers
were
still
in
her
hair
but
others
were
scattered
upon
the
carpet
together
with
her
gloves
her
silk
pelisse
and
muff
and
hood
tears
were
mingling
with
the
pearls
on
her
bosom
her
swollen
eyes
appeared
to
make
strange
confidences
in
the
midst
of
so
much
luxury
her
distress
was
horrible
and
she
seemed
unable
to
summon
courage
to
speak
poor
darling
said
madame
du
tillet
what
a
mistaken
idea
you
have
of
my
marriage
if
you
think
that
i
can
help
you
hearing
this
revelation
dragged
from
her
sister
s
heart
by
the
violence
of
the
storm
she
herself
had
raised
there
the
countess
looked
with
stupefied
eyes
at
the
banker
s
wife
her
tears
stopped
and
her
eyes
grew
fixed
are
you
in
misery
as
well
my
dearest
she
said
in
a
low
voice
my
griefs
will
not
ease
but
tell
them
to
me
darling
i
am
not
yet
too
selfish
to
listen
are
we
to
suffer
together
once
more
as
we
did
in
girlhood
but
alas
we
suffer
apart
said
the
banker
s
wife
you
and
i
live
in
two
worlds
at
enmity
with
each
other
i
go
to
the
tuileries
when
you
are
not
there
our
husbands
belong
to
opposite
parties
i
am
the
wife
of
an
ambitious
banker
a
bad
man
my
darling
while
you
have
a
noble
kind
and
generous
oh
don
t
reproach
me
cried
the
countess
to
understand
my
position
a
woman
must
have
borne
the
weariness
of
a
vapid
and
barren
life
and
have
entered
suddenly
into
a
paradise
of
light
and
love
she
must
know
the
happiness
of
feeling
her
whole
life
in
that
of
another
of
espousing
as
it
were
the
infinite
emotions
of
a
poet
s
soul
of
living
a
double
existence
going
coming
with
him
in
his
courses
through
space
through
the
world
of
ambition
suffering
with
his
griefs
rising
on
the
wings
of
his
high
pleasures
developing
her
faculties
on
some
vast
stage
and
all
this
while
living
calm
serene
and
cold
before
an
observing
world
ah
dearest
what
happiness
in
having
at
all
hours
an
enormous
interest
which
multiplies
the
fibres
of
the
heart
and
varies
them
indefinitely
to
feel
no
longer
cold
indifference
to
find
one
s
very
life
depending
on
a
thousand
trifles
on
a
walk
where
an
eye
will
beam
to
us
from
a
crowd
on
a
glance
which
pales
the
sun
ah
what
intoxication
dear
to
live
to
when
other
women
are
praying
on
their
knees
for
emotions
that
never
come
to
them
remember
darling
that
for
this
poem
of
delight
there
is
but
a
single
moment
youth
in
a
few
years
winter
comes
and
cold
ah
if
you
possessed
these
living
riches
of
the
heart
and
were
threatened
with
the
loss
of
them
madame
du
tillet
terrified
had
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
during
the
passionate
utterance
of
this
anthem
i
did
not
even
think
of
reproaching
you
my
beloved
she
said
at
last
seeing
her
sister
s
face
bathed
in
hot
tears
you
have
cast
into
my
soul
in
one
moment
more
brands
than
i
have
tears
to
quench
yes
the
life
i
live
would
justify
to
my
heart
a
love
like
that
you
picture
let
me
believe
that
if
we
could
have
seen
each
other
oftener
we
should
not
now
be
where
we
are
if
you
had
seen
my
sufferings
you
must
have
valued
your
own
happiness
the
more
and
you
might
have
strengthened
me
to
resist
my
tyrant
and
so
have
won
a
sort
of
peace
your
misery
is
an
incident
which
chance
may
change
but
mine
is
daily
and
perpetual
to
my
husband
i
am
a
peg
on
which
to
hang
his
luxury
the
of
his
ambition
a
satisfaction
to
his
vanity
he
has
no
real
affection
for
me
and
no
confidence
ferdinand
is
hard
and
polished
as
that
piece
of
marble
she
continued
striking
the
he
distrusts
me
whatever
i
may
want
for
myself
is
refused
before
i
ask
it
but
as
for
what
flatters
his
vanity
and
proclaims
his
wealth
i
have
no
occasion
to
express
a
wish
he
decorates
my
apartments
he
spends
enormous
sums
upon
my
entertainments
my
servants
my
all
external
matters
are
maintained
with
the
utmost
splendor
his
vanity
spares
no
expense
he
would
trim
his
children
s
with
lace
if
he
could
but
he
would
never
hear
their
cries
or
guess
their
needs
do
you
understand
me
i
am
covered
with
diamonds
when
i
go
to
court
i
wear
the
richest
jewels
in
society
but
i
have
not
one
farthing
i
can
use
madame
du
tillet
who
they
say
is
envied
who
appears
to
float
in
gold
has
not
a
hundred
francs
she
can
call
her
own
if
the
father
cares
little
for
his
child
he
cares
less
for
its
mother
ah
he
has
cruelly
made
me
feel
that
he
bought
me
and
that
in
marrying
me
without
a
dot
he
was
wronged
i
might
perhaps
have
won
him
to
love
me
but
there
s
an
outside
influence
against
it
that
of
a
woman
who
is
over
fifty
years
of
age
the
widow
of
a
notary
who
rules
him
i
shall
never
be
free
i
know
that
so
long
as
he
lives
my
life
is
regulated
like
that
of
a
queen
my
meals
are
served
with
the
utmost
formality
at
a
given
hour
i
must
drive
to
the
bois
i
am
always
accompanied
by
two
footmen
in
full
dress
i
am
obliged
to
return
at
a
certain
hour
instead
of
giving
orders
i
receive
them
at
a
ball
at
the
theatre
a
servant
comes
to
me
and
says
madame
s
carriage
is
ready
and
i
am
obliged
to
go
in
the
midst
perhaps
of
something
i
enjoy
ferdinand
would
be
furious
if
i
did
not
obey
the
etiquette
he
prescribes
for
his
wife
he
frightens
me
in
the
midst
of
this
hateful
opulence
i
find
myself
regretting
the
past
and
thinking
that
our
mother
was
kind
she
left
us
the
nights
when
we
could
talk
together
at
any
rate
i
was
living
with
a
dear
being
who
loved
me
and
suffered
with
me
whereas
here
in
this
sumptuous
house
i
live
in
a
at
this
terrible
confession
the
countess
caught
her
sister
s
hand
and
kissed
it
weeping
how
then
can
i
help
you
said
eugenie
in
a
low
voice
he
would
be
suspicious
at
once
if
he
surprised
us
here
and
would
insist
on
knowing
all
that
you
have
been
saying
to
me
i
should
be
forced
to
tell
a
lie
which
is
difficult
indeed
with
so
sly
and
treacherous
a
man
he
would
lay
traps
for
me
but
enough
of
my
own
miseries
let
us
think
of
yours
the
forty
thousand
francs
you
want
would
be
of
course
a
mere
nothing
to
ferdinand
who
handles
millions
with
that
fat
banker
baron
de
nucingen
sometimes
at
dinner
in
my
presence
they
say
things
to
each
other
which
make
me
shudder
du
tillet
knows
my
discretion
and
they
often
talk
freely
before
me
being
sure
of
my
silence
well
robbery
and
murder
on
the
seem
to
me
merciful
compared
to
some
of
their
financial
schemes
nucingen
and
he
no
more
mind
destroying
a
man
than
if
he
were
an
animal
often
i
am
told
to
receive
poor
dupes
whose
fate
i
have
heard
them
talk
of
the
night
before
men
who
rush
into
some
business
where
they
are
certain
to
lose
their
all
i
am
tempted
like
leonardo
in
the
brigand
s
cave
to
cry
out
beware
but
if
i
did
what
would
become
of
me
so
i
keep
silence
this
splendid
house
is
a
s
den
but
ferdinand
and
nucingen
will
lavish
millions
for
their
own
caprices
ferdinand
is
now
buying
from
the
other
du
tillet
family
the
site
of
their
old
castle
he
intends
to
rebuild
it
and
add
a
forest
with
large
domains
to
the
estate
and
make
his
son
a
count
he
declares
that
by
the
third
generation
the
family
will
be
noble
nucingen
who
is
tired
of
his
house
in
the
rue
is
building
a
palace
his
wife
is
a
friend
of
mine
ah
she
cried
interrupting
herself
she
might
help
us
she
is
very
bold
with
her
husband
her
fortune
is
in
her
own
right
yes
she
could
save
dear
heart
i
have
but
a
few
hours
left
let
us
go
to
her
this
evening
now
instantly
said
madame
de
vandenesse
throwing
herself
into
madame
du
tillet
s
arms
with
a
burst
of
tears
i
can
t
go
out
at
eleven
o
clock
at
night
replied
her
sister
my
carriage
is
what
are
you
two
plotting
together
said
du
tillet
pushing
open
the
door
of
the
boudoir
he
came
in
showing
a
torpid
face
lighted
now
by
a
speciously
amiable
expression
the
carpets
had
dulled
his
steps
and
the
preoccupation
of
the
two
sisters
had
kept
them
from
noticing
the
noise
of
his
on
entering
the
the
countess
in
whom
the
habits
of
social
life
and
the
freedom
in
which
her
husband
had
left
her
had
developed
both
wit
and
shrewdness
qualities
repressed
in
her
sister
by
marital
despotism
which
simply
continued
that
of
their
mother
saw
that
eugenie
s
terror
was
on
the
point
of
betraying
them
and
she
evaded
that
danger
by
a
frank
answer
i
thought
my
sister
richer
than
she
is
she
replied
looking
straight
at
her
women
are
sometimes
embarrassed
for
money
and
do
not
wish
to
tell
their
husbands
like
josephine
with
napoleon
i
came
here
to
ask
eugenie
to
do
me
a
she
can
easily
do
that
madame
eugenie
is
very
rich
replied
du
tillet
with
concealed
sarcasm
is
she
replied
the
countess
smiling
bitterly
how
much
do
you
want
asked
du
tillet
who
was
not
sorry
to
get
his
into
his
meshes
ah
monsieur
but
i
have
told
you
already
we
do
not
wish
to
let
our
husbands
into
this
affair
said
madame
de
vandenesse
cautiously
aware
that
if
she
took
his
money
she
would
put
herself
at
the
mercy
of
the
man
whose
portrait
eugenie
had
fortunately
drawn
for
her
not
ten
minutes
earlier
i
will
come
and
talk
with
said
the
banker
no
madame
du
tillet
dines
with
a
future
peer
of
france
the
baron
de
nucingen
who
is
to
leave
me
his
place
in
the
chamber
of
then
permit
her
to
join
me
in
my
box
at
the
opera
said
the
countess
without
even
glancing
at
her
sister
so
much
did
she
fear
that
eugenie
s
candor
would
betray
them
she
has
her
own
box
madame
said
du
tillet
nettled
very
good
then
i
will
go
to
hers
replied
the
countess
it
will
be
the
first
time
you
have
done
us
that
honor
said
du
tillet
the
countess
felt
the
sting
of
that
reproach
and
began
to
laugh
well
never
mind
you
shall
not
be
made
to
pay
anything
this
time
adieu
my
she
is
an
insolent
woman
said
du
tillet
picking
up
the
flowers
that
had
fallen
on
the
carpet
you
ought
he
said
to
his
wife
to
study
madame
de
vandenesse
i
d
like
to
see
you
before
the
world
as
insolent
and
overbearing
as
your
sister
has
just
been
here
you
have
a
silly
bourgeois
air
which
i
eugenie
raised
her
eyes
to
heaven
as
her
only
answer
ah
ca
madame
what
have
you
both
been
talking
of
said
the
banker
after
a
pause
pointing
to
the
flowers
what
has
happened
to
make
your
sister
so
anxious
all
of
a
sudden
to
go
to
your
the
poor
helot
endeavored
to
escape
questioning
on
the
score
of
sleepiness
and
turned
to
go
into
her
to
prepare
for
the
night
but
du
tillet
took
her
by
the
arm
and
brought
her
back
under
the
full
light
of
the
which
were
burning
in
two
sconces
between
fragrant
nosegays
he
plunged
his
light
eyes
into
hers
and
said
coldly
your
sister
came
here
to
borrow
forty
thousand
francs
for
a
man
in
whom
she
takes
an
interest
who
ll
be
locked
up
within
three
days
in
a
debtor
s
the
poor
woman
was
seized
with
a
nervous
trembling
which
she
endeavored
to
repress
you
alarm
me
she
said
but
my
sister
is
far
too
well
brought
up
and
she
loves
her
husband
too
much
to
be
interested
in
any
man
to
that
quite
the
contrary
he
said
dryly
girls
brought
up
as
you
two
were
in
the
constraints
and
practice
of
piety
have
a
thirst
for
liberty
they
desire
happiness
and
the
happiness
they
get
in
marriage
is
never
as
fine
as
that
they
dreamt
of
such
girls
make
bad
speak
for
me
said
poor
eugenie
in
a
tone
of
bitter
feeling
but
respect
my
sister
the
comtesse
de
vandenesse
is
happy
her
husband
gives
her
too
much
freedom
not
to
make
her
truly
attached
to
him
besides
if
your
supposition
were
true
she
would
never
have
told
me
of
such
a
it
is
true
he
said
and
i
forbid
you
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
affair
my
interests
demand
that
the
man
shall
go
to
prison
remember
my
madame
du
tillet
left
the
room
she
will
disobey
me
of
course
and
i
shall
find
out
all
the
facts
by
watching
her
thought
du
tillet
when
alone
in
the
boudoir
these
poor
fools
always
think
they
can
do
battle
against
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
rejoined
his
wife
or
to
speak
the
truth
his
slave
the
confidence
made
to
madame
du
tillet
by
madame
felix
de
vandenesse
is
connected
with
so
many
points
of
the
latter
s
history
for
the
last
six
years
that
it
would
be
unintelligible
without
a
succinct
account
of
the
principal
events
of
her
life
chapter
iii
the
history
of
a
fortunate
woman
among
the
remarkable
men
who
owed
their
destiny
to
the
restoration
but
whom
unfortunately
the
restored
monarchy
kept
with
martignac
aloof
from
the
concerns
of
government
was
felix
de
vandenesse
removed
with
several
others
to
the
chamber
of
peers
during
the
last
days
of
charles
x
this
misfortune
though
as
he
supposed
temporary
made
him
think
of
marriage
towards
which
he
was
also
led
as
so
many
men
are
by
a
sort
of
disgust
for
the
emotions
of
gallantry
those
fairy
flowers
of
the
soul
there
comes
a
vital
moment
to
most
of
us
when
social
life
appears
in
all
its
soberness
felix
de
vandenesse
had
been
in
turn
happy
and
unhappy
oftener
unhappy
than
happy
like
men
who
at
their
start
in
life
have
met
with
love
in
its
most
perfect
form
such
privileged
beings
can
never
subsequently
be
satisfied
but
after
fully
experiencing
life
and
comparing
characters
they
attain
to
a
certain
contentment
taking
refuge
in
a
spirit
of
general
indulgence
no
one
deceives
them
for
they
delude
themselves
no
longer
but
their
resignation
their
disillusionment
is
always
graceful
they
expect
what
comes
and
therefor
they
suffer
less

still
rank
among
the
handsomest
and
most
agreeable
men

was
originally
commended
to
many
women
by
one
of
the
noblest
creatures
of
our
epoch
madame
de
mortsauf
who
had
died
it
was
said
out
of
love
and
grief
for
him
but
he
was
specially
trained
for
social
life
by
the
handsome
and
lady
dudley
in
the
eyes
of
many
parisian
women
felix
a
sort
of
hero
of
romance
owed
much
of
his
success
to
the
evil
that
was
said
of
him
madame
de
manerville
had
closed
the
list
of
his
amorous
adventures
and
perhaps
her
dismissal
had
something
to
do
with
his
frame
of
mind
at
any
rate
without
being
in
any
way
a
don
juan
he
had
gathered
in
the
world
of
love
as
many
disenchantments
as
he
had
met
with
in
the
world
of
politics
that
ideal
of
womanhood
and
of
passion
the
type
of
which
perhaps
to
his
sorrow
had
lighted
and
governed
his
dawn
of
life

despaired
of

to
put
an
end
to
the
burden
of
his
various
felicities
by

on
that
point
his
ideas
were
extremely
fixed
he
wanted
a
young
girl
brought
up
in
the
strictest
tenets
of
catholicism
it
was
enough
for
him
to
know
how
the
comtesse

had
trained
her
daughters
to
make
him

he
had
once
resolved
on

the
hand
of
the
eldest
he
himself
had
suffered
under
the
despotism
of
a
mother
he
still
remembered
his
unhappy
childhood
too
well
not
to
recognize
beneath
the
reserves
of
feminine
shyness
the
state
to
which
such
a
yoke
must
have
brought
the
heart
of
a
young
girl
whether
that
heart
was
soured
embittered
or
rebellious
or
whether
it
was
still
peaceful

and
ready
to
unclose
to
noble
sentiments

two
opposite
effects
the
symbols
of
which

grand
figures
of

slavery
epictetus
and

and

feelings
on

resignation
and
tenderness
on
the
other
the
comte
de
vandenesse
recognized
himself
in
de
granville
in
choosing
for
his
wife
an
artless
innocent
and
pure
young
girl
this
young
old
man
determined
to
mingle
a
paternal
feeling
with
the
conjugal
feeling
he
knew
his
own
heart
was
withered
by
the
world
and
by
politics
and
he
felt
that
he
was
giving
in
exchange
for
a
dawning
life
the
remains
of
a
existence
beside
those
springtide
flowers
he
was
putting
the
ice
of
winter
hoary
experience
with
young
and
innocent
ignorance
after
soberly
judging
the
position
he
took
up
his
conjugal
career
with
ample
precaution
indulgence
and
perfect
confidence
were
the
two
anchors
to
which
he
moored

mothers
of
families
ought
to
seek
such
men
for
their
daughters
a
good
mind
protects
like
a
divinity
disenchantment
is
as
as
a
surgeon
experience
as
foreseeing
as
a
mother
those
three
qualities
are
the
cardinal
virtues
of
a
safe
marriage
all
that
his
past
career
had
taught
to
felix
de
vandenesse
the
observations
of
a
life
that
was
busy
literary
and
thoughtful
by
turns
all
his
forces
in
fact
were
now
employed
in
making
his
wife
happy
to
that
end
he
applied
his
mind
when
left
the
maternal
purgatory
she
rose
at
once
into
the
conjugal
paradise
prepared
for
her
by
felix
rue
du
rocher
in
a
house
where
all
things
were
redolent
of
aristocracy
but
where
the
varnish
of
society
did
not
impede
the
ease
and
which
young
and
loving
hearts
desire
so
much
from
the
start
tasted
all
the
sweets
of
material
life
to
the
very
utmost
for
two
years
her
husband
made
himself
as
it
were
her
purveyor
he
explained
to
her
by
degrees
and
with
great
art
the
things
of
life
he
initiated
her
slowly
into
the
mysteries
of
the
highest
society
he
taught
her
the
genealogies
of
noble
families
he
showed
her
the
world
he
guided
her
taste
in
dress
he
trained
her
to
converse
he
took
her
from
theatre
to
theatre
and
made
her
study
literature
and
current
history
this
education
he
accomplished
with
all
the
care
of
a
lover
father
master
and
husband
but
he
did
it
soberly
and
discreetly
he
managed
both
enjoyments
and
instructions
in
such
a
manner
as
not
to
destroy
the
value
of
her
religious
ideas
in
short
he
carried
out
his
enterprise
with
the
wisdom
of
a
great
master
at
the
end
of
four
years
he
had
the
happiness
of
having
formed
in
the
comtesse
de
vandenesse
one
of
the
most
lovable
and
remarkable
young
women
of
our
day
felt
for
felix
precisely
the
feelings
with
which
felix
desired
to
inspire
her
true
friendship
sincere
gratitude
and
a
fraternal
love
in
which
was
mingled
at
certain
times
a
noble
and
dignified
tenderness
such
as
tenderness
between
husband
and
wife
ought
to
be
she
was
a
mother
and
a
good
mother
felix
had
therefore
attached
himself
to
his
young
wife
by
every
bond
without
any
appearance
of
garroting
her
relying
for
his
happiness
on
the
charms
of
habit
none
but
men
trained
in
the
school
of
life
men
who
have
gone
round
the
circle
of
disillusionment
political
and
amorous
are
capable
of
following
out
a
course
like
this
felix
however
found
in
his
work
the
same
pleasure
that
painters
writers
architects
take
in
their
creations
he
doubly
enjoyed
both
the
work
and
its
fruition
as
he
admired
his
wife
so
artless
yet
so
witty
but
natural
lovable
and
chaste
a
girl
and
yet
a
mother
perfectly
free
though
bound
by
the
chains
of
righteousness
the
history
of
all
good
homes
is
that
of
prosperous
peoples
it
can
be
written
in
two
lines
and
has
in
it
nothing
for
literature
so
as
happiness
is
only
explicable
to
and
by
itself
these
four
years
furnish
nothing
to
relate
which
was
not
as
tender
as
the
soft
outlines
of
eternal
cherubs
as
insipid
alas
as
manna
and
about
as
amusing
as
the
tale
of
in
this
edifice
of
happiness
so
carefully
erected
by
felix
de
vandenesse
began
to
crumble
weakened
at
its
base
without
his
knowledge
the
heart
of
a
woman
of
is
no
longer
that
of
a
girl
of
eighteen
any
more
than
the
heart
of
a
woman
of
forty

of

woman
of
thirty

are

the
life
of
woman
each
age
creates
a
new
woman
vandenesse
knew
no
doubt
the
law
of
these
transformations
created
by
our
modern
manners
and
morals
but
he
forgot
them
in
his
own
case
just
as
the
best
grammarian
will
forget
a
rule
of
grammar
in
writing
a
book
or
the
greatest
general
in
the
field
under
fire
surprised
by
some
change
of
base
forgets
his
military
tactics
the
man
who
can
perpetually
bring
his
thought
to
bear
upon
his
facts
is
a
man
of
genius
but
the
man
of
the
highest
genius
does
not
display
genius
at
all
times
if
he
did
he
would
be
like
to
god
after
four
years
of
this
life
with
never
a
shock
to
the
soul
nor
a
word
that
produced
the
slightest
discord
in
this
sweet
concert
of
sentiment
the
countess
feeling
herself
developed
like
a
beautiful
plant
in
a
fertile
soil
caressed
by
the
sun
of
a
cloudless
sky
awoke
to
a
sense
of
a
new
self
this
crisis
of
her
life
the
subject
of
this
scene
would
be
incomprehensible
without
certain
explanations
which
may
extenuate
in
the
eyes
of
women
the
of
this
young
countess
a
happy
wife
a
happy
mother
who
seems
at
first
sight
inexcusable
life
results
from
the
action
of
two
opposing
principles
when
one
of
them
is
lacking
the
being
suffers
vandenesse
by
satisfying
every
need
had
suppressed
desire
that
king
of
creation
which
fills
an
enormous
place
in
the
moral
forces
extreme
heat
extreme
sorrow
complete
happiness
are
all
despotic
principles
that
reign
over
spaces
devoid
of
production
they
insist
on
being
solitary
they
stifle
all
that
is
not
themselves
vandenesse
was
not
a
woman
and
none
but
women
know
the
art
of
varying
happiness
hence
their
coquetry
refusals
fears
quarrels
and
the
clever
foolery
with
which
they
put
in
doubt
the
things
that
seemed
to
be
without
a
cloud
the
night
before
men
may
weary
by
their
constancy
but
women
never
vandenesse
was
too
thoroughly
kind
by
nature
to
worry
deliberately
the
woman
he
loved
on
the
contrary
he
kept
her
in
the
bluest
and
least
cloudy
heaven
of
love
the
problem
of
eternal
beatitude
is
one
of
those
whose
solution
is
known
only
to
god
here
below
the
sublimest
poets
have
simply
harassed
their
readers
when
attempting
to
picture
paradise
dante
s
reef
was
that
of
vandenesse
all
honor
to
such
courage
felix
s
wife
began
to
find
monotony
in
an
eden
so
well
arranged
the
perfect
happiness
which
the
first
woman
found
in
her
terrestrial
paradise
gave
her
at
length
a
sort
of
nausea
of
sweet
things
and
made
the
countess
wish
like
rivarol
reading
florian
for
a
wolf
in
the
fold
such
judging
by
the
history
of
ages
appears
to
be
the
meaning
of
that
emblematic
serpent
to
which
eve
listened
in
all
probability
out
of
ennui
this
deduction
may
seem
a
little
venturesome
to
protestants
who
take
the
book
of
genesis
more
seriously
than
the
jews
themselves
the
situation
of
madame
de
vandenesse
can
however
be
explained
without
recourse
to
biblical
images
she
felt
in
her
soul
an
enormous
power
that
was
unemployed
her
happiness
gave
her
no
suffering
it
rolled
along
without
care
or
uneasiness
she
was
not
afraid
of
losing
it
each
morning
it
shone
upon
her
with
the
same
blue
sky
the
same
smile
the
same
sweet
words
that
clear
still
lake
was
unruffled
by
any
breeze
even
a
zephyr
she
would
fain
have
seen
a
ripple
on
its
glassy
surface
her
desire
had
something
so
infantine
about
it
that
it
ought
to
be
excused
but
society
is
not
more
indulgent
than
the
god
of
genesis
madame
de
vandenesse
having
now
become
intelligently
clever
was
aware
that
such
sentiments
were
not
permissible
and
she
refrained
from
confiding
them
to
her
dear
little
her
genuine
simplicity
had
not
invented
any
other
name
for
him
for
one
can
t
call
up
in
cold
blood
that
delightfully
exaggerated
language
which
love
imparts
to
its
victims
in
the
midst
of
flames
vandenesse
glad
of
this
adorable
reserve
kept
his
wife
by
deliberate
calculations
in
the
temperate
regions
of
conjugal
affection
he
never
condescended
to
seek
a
reward
or
even
an
acknowledgment
of
the
infinite
pains
which
he
gave
himself
his
wife
thought
his
luxury
and
good
taste
her
natural
right
and
she
felt
no
gratitude
for
the
fact
that
her
pride
and
had
never
suffered
it
was
thus
in
everything
kindness
has
its
mishaps
often
it
is
attributed
to
temperament
people
are
seldom
willing
to
recognize
it
as
the
secret
effort
of
a
noble
soul
about
this
period
of
her
life
madame
felix
de
vandenesse
had
attained
to
a
degree
of
worldly
knowledge
which
enabled
her
to
quit
the
insignificant
role
of
a
timid
listening
and
observing
supernumerary
a
part
played
they
say
for
some
time
by
giulia
grisi
in
the
chorus
at
la
scala
the
young
countess
now
felt
herself
capable
of
attempting
the
part
of
and
she
did
so
on
several
occasions
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
her
husband
she
began
to
mingle
in
conversations
intelligent
ideas
and
delicate
observations
put
into
her
mind
by
her
intercourse
with
her
husband
made
her
remarked
upon
and
success
emboldened
her
vandenesse
to
whom
the
world
admitted
that
his
wife
was
beautiful
was
delighted
when
the
same
assurance
was
given
that
she
was
clever
and
witty
on
their
return
from
a
ball
concert
or
rout
where
marie
had
shone
brilliantly
she
would
turn
to
her
husband
as
she
took
off
her
ornaments
and
say
with
a
joyous
air
were
you
pleased
with
me
this
evening
the
countess
excited
jealousies
among
others
that
of
her
husband
s
sister
madame
de
listomere
who
until
now
had
patronized
her
thinking
that
she
protected
a
foil
to
her
own
merits
a
countess
beautiful
witty
and
virtuous
what
a
prey
for
the
tongues
of
the
world
felix
had
broken
with
too
many
women
and
too
many
women
had
broken
with
him
to
leave
them
indifferent
to
his
marriage
when
these
women
beheld
in
madame
de
vandenesse
a
small
woman
with
red
hands
and
rather
awkward
manner
saying
little
and
apparently
not
thinking
much
they
thought
themselves
sufficiently
avenged
the
disasters
of
july
supervened
society
was
dissolved
for
two
years
the
rich
evaded
the
turmoil
and
left
paris
either
for
foreign
travel
or
for
their
estates
in
the
country
and
none
of
the
salons
reopened
until
when
that
time
came
the
faubourg
still
sulked
but
it
held
intercourse
with
a
few
houses
regarding
them
as
neutral
ground
among
others
that
of
the
austrian
ambassador
where
the
legitimist
society
and
the
new
social
world
met
together
in
the
persons
of
their
best
representatives
attached
by
many
ties
of
the
heart
and
by
gratitude
to
the
exiled
family
and
strong
in
his
personal
convictions
vandenesse
did
not
consider
himself
obliged
to
imitate
the
silly
behavior
of
his
party
in
times
of
danger
he
had
done
his
duty
at
the
risk
of
his
life
his
fidelity
had
never
been
compromised
and
he
determined
to
take
his
wife
into
general
society
without
fear
of
its
becoming
so
his
former
mistresses
could
scarcely
recognize
the
bride
they
had
thought
so
childish
in
the
elegant
witty
and
gentle
countess
who
now
appeared
in
society
with
the
exquisite
manners
of
the
highest
female
aristocracy
mesdames
d
espard
de
manerville
and
lady
dudley
with
others
less
known
felt
the
serpent
waking
up
in
the
depths
of
their
hearts
they
heard
the
low
hissings
of
angry
pride
they
were
jealous
of
felix
s
happiness
and
would
gladly
have
given
their
prettiest
jewel
to
do
him
some
harm
but
instead
of
being
hostile
to
the
countess
these
kind
women
surrounded
her
showed
her
the
utmost
friendship
and
praised
her
to
me
sufficiently
aware
of
their
intentions
felix
watched
their
relations
with
marie
and
warned
her
to
distrust
them
they
all
suspected
the
uneasiness
of
the
count
at
their
intimacy
with
his
wife
and
they
redoubled
their
attentions
and
flatteries
so
that
they
gave
her
an
enormous
vogue
in
society
to
the
great
displeasure
of
her
the
marquise
de
listomere
who
could
not
understand
it
the
comtesse
felix
de
vandenesse
was
cited
as
the
most
charming
and
the
cleverest
woman
in
paris
marie
s
other
the
marquise
charles
de
vandenesse
was
consumed
with
vexation
at
the
confusion
of
names
and
the
comparisons
it
sometimes
brought
about
though
the
marquise
was
a
handsome
and
clever
woman
her
rivals
took
delight
in
comparing
her
with
her
with
all
the
more
point
because
the
countess
was
a
dozen
years
younger
these
women
knew
very
well
what
bitterness
marie
s
social
vogue
would
bring
into
her
intercourse
with
both
of
her
who
in
fact
became
cold
and
disobliging
in
proportion
to
her
triumph
in
society
she
was
thus
surrounded
by
dangerous
relations
and
intimate
enemies
every
one
knows
that
french
literature
at
that
particular
period
was
endeavoring
to
defend
itself
against
an
apathetic
indifference
the
result
of
the
political
drama
by
producing
works
more
or
less
byronian
in
which
the
only
topics
really
discussed
were
conjugal
delinquencies
infringements
of
the
marriage
tie
formed
the
staple
of
reviews
books
and
dramas
this
eternal
subject
grew
more
and
more
the
fashion
the
lover
that
nightmare
of
husbands
was
everywhere
except
perhaps
in
homes
where
in
point
of
fact
under
the
bourgeois
regime
he
was
less
seen
than
formerly
it
is
not
when
every
one
rushes
to
their
window
and
cries
thief
and
lights
the
streets
that
robbers
abound
it
is
true
that
during
those
years
so
fruitful
of
turmoil
urban
political
and
moral
a
few
matrimonial
catastrophes
took
place
but
these
were
exceptional
and
less
observed
than
they
would
have
been
under
the
restoration
nevertheless
women
talked
a
great
deal
together
about
books
and
the
stage
then
the
two
chief
forms
of
poesy
the
lover
thus
became
one
of
their
leading
topics
a
being
rare
in
point
of
act
and
much
desired
the
few
affairs
which
were
known
gave
rise
to
discussions
and
these
discussions
were
as
usually
happens
carried
on
by
immaculate
women
a
fact
worthy
of
remark
is
the
aversion
shown
to
such
conversations
by
women
who
are
enjoying
some
illicit
happiness
they
maintain
before
the
eyes
of
the
world
a
reserved
prudish
and
even
timid
countenance
they
seem
to
ask
silence
on
the
subject
or
some
condonation
of
their
pleasure
from
society
when
on
the
contrary
a
woman
talks
freely
of
such
catastrophes
and
seems
to
take
pleasure
in
doing
so
allowing
herself
to
explain
the
emotions
that
justify
the
guilty
parties
we
may
be
sure
that
she
herself
is
at
the
crossways
of
indecision
and
does
not
know
what
road
she
might
take
during
this
winter
the
comtesse
de
vandenesse
heard
the
great
voice
of
the
social
world
roaring
in
her
ears
and
the
wind
of
its
stormy
gusts
blew
round
her
her
pretended
friends
who
maintained
their
reputations
at
the
height
of
their
rank
and
their
positions
often
produced
in
her
presence
the
seductive
idea
of
the
lover
they
cast
into
her
soul
certain
ardent
talk
of
love
the
mot
d
enigme
which
life
propounds
to
woman
the
grand
passion
as
madame
de
stael
called
it
preaching
by
example
when
the
countess
asked
naively
in
a
small
and
select
circle
of
these
friends
what
difference
there
was
between
a
lover
and
a
husband
all
those
who
wished
evil
to
felix
took
care
to
reply
in
a
way
to
pique
her
curiosity
or
fire
her
imagination
or
touch
her
heart
or
interest
her
mind
oh
my
dear
we
vegetate
with
a
husband
but
we
live
with
a
lover
said
her
the
marquise
marriage
my
dear
is
our
purgatory
love
is
paradise
said
lady
dudley
don
t
believe
her
cried
mademoiselle
des
touches
it
is
but
a
hell
we
like
remarked
madame
de
rochefide
there
is
often
more
pleasure
in
suffering
than
in
happiness
look
at
the
martyrs
with
a
husband
my
dear
innocent
we
live
as
it
were
in
our
own
life
but
to
love
is
to
live
in
the
life
of
another
said
the
marquise
d
espard
a
lover
is
forbidden
fruit
and
that
to
me
says
all
cried
the
pretty
moina
de
laughing
when
she
was
not
at
some
diplomatic
rout
or
at
a
ball
given
by
rich
foreigners
like
lady
dudley
or
the
princesse
galathionne
the
comtesse
de
vandenesse
might
be
seen
after
the
opera
at
the
houses
of
madame
d
espard
the
marquise
de
listomere
mademoiselle
des
touches
the
comtesse
de
montcornet
or
the
vicomtesse
de
grandlieu
the
only
aristocratic
houses
then
open
and
never
did
she
leave
any
one
of
them
without
some
evil
seed
of
the
world
being
sown
in
her
heart
she
heard
talk
of
completing
her
life
a
saying
much
in
fashion
in
those
days
of
being
comprehended
another
word
to
which
women
gave
strange
meanings
she
often
returned
home
uneasy
excited
curious
and
thoughtful
she
began
to
find
something
less
she
hardly
knew
what
in
her
life
but
she
did
not
yet
go
so
far
as
to
think
it
lonely
chapter
iv
a
celebrated
man
the
most
amusing
society
but
also
the
most
mixed
which
madame
felix
de
vandenesse
frequented
was
that
of
the
comtesse
de
montcornet
a
charming
little
woman
who
received
illustrious
artists
leading
financial
personages
distinguished
writers
but
only
after
subjecting
them
to
so
rigid
an
examination
that
the
most
exclusive
aristocrat
had
nothing
to
fear
in
coming
in
contact
with
this
society
the
loftiest
pretensions
were
there
respected
during
the
winter
of
when
society
rallied
after
the
revolution
of
july
some
salons
notably
those
of
mesdames
d
espard
and
de
listomere
mademoiselle
des
touches
and
the
duchesse
de
grandlieu
had
selected
certain
of
the
celebrities
in
art
science
literature
and
politics
and
received
them
society
can
lose
nothing
of
its
rights
and
it
must
be
amused
at
a
concert
given
by
madame
de
montcornet
toward
the
close
of
the
winter
of
a
man
of
rising
fame
in
literature
and
politics
appeared
in
her
salon
brought
there
by
one
of
the
wittiest
but
also
one
of
the
laziest
writers
of
that
epoch
emile
blondet
celebrated
behind
closed
doors
highly
praised
by
journalists
but
unknown
beyond
the
barriers
blondet
himself
was
well
aware
of
this
he
indulged
in
no
illusions
and
among
his
other
witty
and
contemptuous
sayings
he
was
wont
to
remark
that
fame
is
a
poison
good
to
take
in
little
doses
from
the
moment
when
the
man
we
speak
of
raoul
nathan
after
a
long
struggle
forced
his
way
to
the
public
gaze
he
had
put
to
profit
the
sudden
infatuation
for
form
manifested
by
those
elegant
descendants
of
the
middle
ages
jestingly
called
young
france
he
assumed
the
singularities
of
a
man
of
genius
and
enrolled
himself
among
those
adorers
of
art
whose
intentions
let
us
say
were
excellent
for
surely
nothing
could
be
more
ridiculous
than
the
costume
of
frenchmen
in
the
nineteenth
century
and
nothing
more
courageous
than
an
attempt
to
reform
it
raoul
let
us
do
him
this
justice
presents
in
his
person
something
fine
fantastic
and
extraordinary
which
needs
a
frame
his
enemies
or
his
friends
they
are
about
the
same
thing
agree
that
nothing
could
harmonize
better
with
his
mind
than
his
outward
form
raoul
nathan
would
perhaps
be
more
singular
if
left
to
his
natural
self
than
he
is
with
his
various
accompaniments
his
worn
and
haggard
face
gives
him
an
appearance
of
having
fought
with
angels
or
devils
it
bears
some
resemblance
to
that
the
german
painters
give
to
the
dead
christ
countless
signs
of
a
constant
struggle
between
failing
human
nature
and
the
powers
on
high
appear
in
it
but
the
lines
in
his
hollow
cheeks
the
projections
of
his
crooked
furrowed
skull
the
caverns
around
his
eyes
and
behind
his
temples
show
nothing
weakly
in
his
constitution
his
hard
membranes
his
visible
bones
are
the
signs
of
remarkable
solidity
and
though
his
skin
discolored
by
excesses
clings
to
those
bones
as
if
dried
there
by
inward
fires
it
nevertheless
covers
a
most
powerful
structure
he
is
thin
and
tall
his
long
hair
always
in
disorder
is
worn
so
for
effect
this
byron
has
heron
legs
and
stiffened
an
exaggerated
stoop
hands
with
knotty
muscles
firm
as
a
crab
s
claws
and
long
thin
wiry
fingers
raoul
s
eyes
are
napoleonic
blue
eyes
which
pierce
to
the
soul
his
nose
is
crooked
and
very
shrewd
his
mouth
charming
embellished
with
the
whitest
teeth
that
any
woman
could
desire
there
is
fire
and
movement
in
the
head
and
genius
on
that
brow
raoul
belongs
to
the
small
number
of
men
who
strike
your
mind
as
you
pass
them
and
who
in
a
salon
make
a
luminous
spot
to
which
all
eyes
are
attracted
he
makes
himself
remarked
also
by
his
neglige
if
we
may
borrow
from
moliere
the
word
which
eliante
uses
to
express
the
want
of
personal
neatness
his
clothes
always
seem
to
have
been
twisted
frayed
and
crumpled
intentionally
in
order
to
harmonize
with
his
physiognomy
he
keeps
one
of
his
hands
habitually
in
the
bosom
of
his
waistcoat
in
the
pose
which
girodet
s
portrait
of
monsieur
de
chateaubriand
has
rendered
famous
but
less
to
imitate
that
great
man
for
he
does
not
wish
to
resemble
any
one
than
to
rumple
the
front
of
his
shirt
his
cravat
is
no
sooner
put
on
than
it
is
twisted
by
the
convulsive
motions
of
his
head
which
are
quick
and
abrupt
like
those
of
a
thoroughbred
horse
impatient
of
harness
and
constantly
tossing
up
its
head
to
rid
itself
of
bit
and
bridle
his
long
and
pointed
beard
is
neither
combed
nor
perfumed
nor
brushed
nor
trimmed
like
those
of
the
elegant
young
men
of
society
he
lets
it
alone
to
grow
as
it
will
his
hair
getting
between
the
collar
of
his
coat
and
his
cravat
lies
luxuriantly
on
his
shoulders
and
greases
whatever
spot
it
touches
his
wiry
bony
hands
ignore
a
nailbrush
and
the
luxury
of
lemon
some
of
his
cofeuilletonists
declare
that
purifying
waters
seldom
touch
their
calcined
skin
in
short
the
terrible
raoul
is
grotesque
his
movements
are
jerky
as
if
produced
by
imperfect
machinery
his
gait
rejects
all
idea
of
order
and
proceeds
by
spasmodic
and
sudden
stoppages
which
knock
him
violently
against
peaceable
citizens
on
the
streets
and
boulevards
of
paris
his
conversation
full
of
caustic
humor
of
bitter
satire
follows
the
gait
of
his
body
suddenly
it
abandons
its
tone
of
vengeance
and
turns
sweet
poetic
consoling
gentle
without
apparent
reason
he
falls
into
inexplicable
silences
or
turns
somersets
of
wit
which
at
times
are
somewhat
wearying
in
society
he
is
boldly
awkward
and
exhibits
a
contempt
for
conventions
and
a
critical
air
about
things
respected
which
makes
him
unpleasant
to
narrow
minds
and
also
to
those
who
strive
to
preserve
the
doctrines
of
gentlemanly
politeness
but
for
all
that
there
is
a
sort
of
lawless
originality
about
him
which
women
do
not
dislike
besides
to
them
he
is
often
most
amiably
courteous
he
seems
to
take
pleasure
in
making
them
forget
his
personal
singularities
and
thus
obtains
a
victory
over
antipathies
which
flatters
either
his
vanity
his
or
his
pride
why
do
you
present
yourself
like
that
said
the
marquise
de
vandenesse
one
day
pearls
live
in
he
answered
conceitedly
to
another
who
asked
him
somewhat
the
same
question
he
replied
if
i
were
charming
to
all
the
world
how
could
i
seem
better
still
to
the
one
woman
i
wish
to
please
raoul
nathan
imports
this
same
natural
disorder
which
he
uses
as
a
banner
into
his
intellectual
life
and
the
attribute
is
not
misleading
his
talent
is
very
much
that
of
the
poor
girls
who
go
about
in
bourgeois
families
to
work
by
the
day
he
was
first
a
critic
and
a
great
critic
but
he
felt
himself
cheated
in
that
vocation
his
articles
were
equal
to
books
he
said
the
profits
of
theatrical
work
then
allured
him
but
incapable
of
the
slow
and
steady
application
required
for
stage
arrangement
he
was
forced
to
associate
with
himself
a
vaudevillist
du
bruel
who
took
his
ideas
worked
them
over
and
reduced
them
into
those
productive
little
pieces
full
of
wit
which
are
written
expressly
for
actors
and
actresses
between
them
they
had
invented
florine
an
actress
now
in
vogue
humiliated
by
this
association
which
was
that
of
the
siamese
twins
nathan
had
produced
alone
at
the
a
serious
drama
which
fell
with
all
the
honors
of
war
amid
salvos
of
thundering
articles
in
his
youth
he
had
once
before
appeared
at
the
great
and
noble
in
a
splendid
romantic
play
of
the
style
of
pinto
a
period
when
the
classic
reigned
supreme
the
odeon
was
so
violently
agitated
for
three
nights
that
the
play
was
forbidden
by
the
censor
this
second
piece
was
considered
by
many
a
masterpiece
and
won
him
more
real
reputation
than
all
his
productive
little
pieces
done
with
collaborators
but
only
among
a
class
to
whom
little
attention
is
paid
that
of
connoisseurs
and
persons
of
true
taste
make
another
failure
like
that
said
emile
blondet
and
you
ll
be
but
instead
of
continuing
in
that
difficult
path
nathan
had
fallen
out
of
sheer
necessity
into
the
powder
and
patches
of
vaudeville
costume
plays
and
the
reproduction
scenically
of
successful
novels
nevertheless
he
passed
for
a
great
mind
which
had
not
said
its
last
word
he
had
moreover
attempted
permanent
literature
having
published
three
novels
not
to
speak
of
several
others
which
he
kept
in
press
like
fish
in
a
tank
one
of
these
three
books
the
first
like
that
of
many
writers
who
can
only
make
one
real
trip
into
literature
had
obtained
a
very
brilliant
success
this
work
imprudently
placed
in
the
front
rank
this
really
artistic
work
he
was
never
weary
of
calling
the
finest
book
of
the
period
the
novel
of
the
century
raoul
complained
bitterly
of
the
exigencies
of
art
he
was
one
of
those
who
contributed
most
to
bring
all
created
work
pictures
statues
books
building
under
the
single
standard
of
art
he
had
begun
his
career
by
committing
a
volume
of
verse
which
won
him
a
place
in
the
pleiades
of
living
poets
among
these
verses
was
a
nebulous
poem
that
was
greatly
admired
forced
by
want
of
means
to
keep
on
producing
he
went
from
the
theatre
to
the
press
and
from
the
press
to
the
theatre
dissipating
and
scattering
his
talent
but
believing
always
in
his
vein
his
fame
was
therefore
not
unpublished
like
that
of
so
many
great
minds
in
extremity
who
sustain
themselves
only
by
the
thought
of
work
to
be
done
nathan
resembled
a
man
of
genius
and
had
he
marched
to
the
scaffold
as
he
sometimes
wished
he
could
have
done
he
might
have
struck
his
brow
with
the
famous
action
of
andre
chenier
seized
with
political
ambition
on
seeing
the
rise
to
power
of
a
dozen
authors
professors
metaphysicians
and
historians
who
encrusted
themselves
so
to
speak
upon
the
machine
during
the
turmoils
of
and
he
regretted
that
he
had
not
spent
his
time
on
political
instead
of
literary
articles
he
thought
himself
superior
to
all
those
parvenus
whose
success
inspired
him
with
consuming
jealousy
he
belonged
to
the
class
of
minds
ambitious
of
everything
capable
of
all
things
from
whom
success
is
as
it
were
stolen
who
go
their
way
dashing
at
a
hundred
luminous
points
and
settling
upon
none
exhausting
at
last
the
of
others
at
this
particular
time
he
was
going
from
into
republicanism
to
return
very
likely
to
ministerialism
he
looked
for
a
bone
to
gnaw
in
all
corners
searching
for
a
safe
place
where
he
could
bark
secure
from
kicks
and
make
himself
feared
but
he
had
the
mortification
of
finding
he
was
held
to
be
of
no
account
by
de
marsay
then
at
the
head
of
the
government
who
had
no
consideration
whatever
for
authors
among
whom
he
did
not
find
what
richelieu
called
a
consecutive
mind
or
more
correctly
continuity
of
ideas
he
counted
as
any
minister
would
have
done
on
the
constant
embarrassment
of
raoul
s
business
affairs
sooner
or
later
necessity
would
bring
him
to
accept
conditions
instead
of
imposing
them
the
real
but
carefully
concealed
character
of
raoul
nathan
is
of
a
piece
with
his
public
career
he
is
a
comedian
in
good
faith
selfish
as
if
the
state
were
himself
and
a
very
clever
orator
no
one
knows
better
how
to
play
off
sentiments
glory
in
false
grandeurs
deck
himself
with
moral
beauty
do
honor
to
his
nature
in
language
and
pose
like
alceste
while
behaving
like
philinte
his
egotism
trots
along
protected
by
this
cardboard
armor
and
often
almost
reaches
the
end
he
seeks
lazy
to
a
superlative
degree
he
does
nothing
however
until
he
is
prodded
by
the
bayonets
of
need
he
is
incapable
of
continued
labor
applied
to
the
creation
of
a
work
but
in
a
paroxysm
of
rage
caused
by
wounded
vanity
or
in
a
crisis
brought
on
by
creditors
he
leaps
the
eurotas
and
attains
to
some
great
triumph
of
his
intellect
after
which
weary
and
surprised
at
having
created
anything
he
drops
back
into
the
marasmus
of
parisian
dissipation
wants
become
formidable
he
has
no
strength
to
face
them
and
then
he
comes
down
from
his
pedestal
and
compromises
influenced
by
a
false
idea
of
his
grandeur
and
of
his
future
the
measure
of
which
he
reckons
on
the
noble
success
of
one
of
his
former
comrades
one
of
the
few
great
talents
brought
to
light
by
the
revolution
of
july
he
allows
himself
in
order
to
get
out
of
his
embarrassments
certain
laxities
of
principle
with
persons
who
are
friendly
to
him
laxities
which
never
come
to
the
surface
but
are
buried
in
private
life
where
no
one
ever
mentions
or
complains
of
them
the
shallowness
of
his
heart
the
impurity
of
his
hand
which
clasps
that
of
all
vices
all
evils
all
treacheries
all
opinions
have
made
him
as
inviolable
as
a
constitutional
king
venial
sins
which
excite
a
hue
and
cry
against
a
man
of
high
character
are
thought
nothing
of
in
him
the
world
hastens
to
excuse
them
men
who
might
otherwise
be
inclined
to
despise
him
shake
hands
with
him
fearing
that
the
day
may
come
when
they
will
need
him
he
has
in
fact
so
many
friends
that
he
wishes
for
enemies
judged
from
a
literary
point
of
view
nathan
lacks
style
and
cultivation
like
most
young
men
ambitious
of
literary
fame
he
disgorges
what
he
acquired
yesterday
he
has
neither
the
time
nor
the
patience
to
write
carefully
he
does
not
observe
but
he
listens
incapable
of
constructing
a
vigorously
framed
plot
he
sometimes
makes
up
for
it
by
the
impetuous
ardor
of
his
drawing
he
does
passion
to
use
a
term
of
the
literary
argot
but
instead
of
awaking
ideas
his
heroes
are
simply
enlarged
individualities
who
excite
only
fugitive
sympathies
they
are
not
connected
with
any
of
the
great
interests
of
life
and
consequently
they
represent
nothing
nevertheless
nathan
maintains
his
ground
by
the
quickness
of
his
mind
by
those
lucky
hits
which
call
a
good
he
is
the
cleverest
shot
at
ideas
on
the
fly
in
all
paris
his
fecundity
is
not
his
own
but
that
of
his
epoch
he
lives
on
chance
events
and
to
control
them
he
distorts
their
meaning
in
short
he
is
not
his
presentation
is
false
in
him
as
comte
felix
said
is
the
born
juggler
moreover
his
pen
gets
its
ink
in
the
boudoir
of
an
actress
raoul
nathan
is
a
fair
type
of
the
parisian
literary
youth
of
the
day
with
its
false
grandeurs
and
its
real
misery
he
represents
that
youth
by
his
incomplete
beauties
and
his
headlong
falls
by
the
turbulent
torrent
of
his
existence
with
its
sudden
reverses
and
its
triumphs
he
is
truly
the
child
of
a
century
consumed
with
envy
a
century
with
a
thousand
rivalries
lurking
under
many
a
system
which
nourish
to
their
own
profit
that
hydra
of
anarchy
which
wants
wealth
without
toil
fame
without
talent
success
without
effort
but
whose
vices
force
it
after
much
rebellion
and
many
skirmishes
to
accept
the
budget
under
the
powers
that
be
when
so
many
young
ambitions
starting
on
foot
give
one
another
rendezvous
at
the
same
point
there
is
always
contention
of
wills
extreme
wretchedness
bitter
struggles
in
this
dreadful
battle
selfishness
the
most
overbearing
or
the
most
adroit
selfishness
gains
the
victory
and
it
is
envied
and
applauded
in
spite
as
moliere
said
of
outcries
and
we
all
know
it
when
in
his
capacity
as
enemy
to
the
new
dynasty
raoul
was
introduced
in
the
salon
of
madame
de
montcornet
his
apparent
grandeurs
were
flourishing
he
was
accepted
as
the
political
critic
of
the
de
marsays
the
rastignacs
and
the
who
had
stepped
into
power
emile
blondet
the
victim
of
incurable
hesitation
and
of
his
innate
repugnance
to
any
action
that
concerned
only
himself
continued
his
trade
of
scoffer
took
sides
with
no
one
and
kept
well
with
all
he
was
friendly
with
raoul
friendly
with
rastignac
friendly
with
montcornet
you
are
a
political
triangle
said
de
marsay
laughing
when
they
met
at
the
opera
that
geometric
form
my
dear
fellow
belongs
only
to
the
deity
who
has
nothing
to
do
ambitious
men
ought
to
follow
curved
lines
the
shortest
road
in
seen
from
a
distance
raoul
nathan
was
a
very
fine
meteor
fashion
accepted
his
ways
and
his
appearance
his
borrowed
republicanism
gave
him
for
the
time
being
that
jansenist
harshness
assumed
by
the
defenders
of
the
popular
cause
while
they
inwardly
scoff
at
it
a
quality
not
without
charm
in
the
eyes
of
women
women
like
to
perform
prodigies
break
rocks
and
soften
natures
which
seem
of
iron
raoul
s
moral
costume
was
therefore
in
keeping
with
his
clothes
he
was
fitted
to
be
what
he
became
to
the
eve
who
was
bored
in
her
paradise
in
the
rue
du
rocher
the
fascinating
serpent
the
fine
talker
with
magnetic
eyes
and
harmonious
motions
who
tempted
the
first
woman
no
sooner
had
the
comtesse
marie
laid
eyes
on
raoul
than
she
felt
an
inward
emotion
the
violence
of
which
caused
her
a
species
of
terror
the
glance
of
that
fraudulent
great
man
exercised
a
physical
influence
upon
her
which
quivered
in
her
very
heart
and
troubled
it
but
the
trouble
was
pleasure
the
purple
mantle
which
celebrity
had
draped
for
a
moment
round
nathan
s
shoulders
dazzled
the
ingenuous
young
woman
when
tea
was
served
she
rose
from
her
seat
among
a
knot
of
talking
women
where
she
had
been
striving
to
see
and
hear
that
extraordinary
being
her
silence
and
absorption
were
noticed
by
her
false
friends
the
countess
approached
the
divan
in
the
centre
of
the
room
where
raoul
was
perorating
she
stood
there
with
her
arm
in
that
of
madame
octave
de
camp
an
excellent
woman
who
kept
the
secret
of
the
involuntary
trembling
by
which
these
violent
emotions
betrayed
themselves
though
the
eyes
of
a
captivated
woman
are
apt
to
shed
wonderful
sweetness
raoul
was
too
occupied
at
that
moment
in
letting
off
fireworks
too
absorbed
in
his
epigrams
going
up
like
rockets
in
the
midst
of
which
were
flaming
portraits
drawn
in
lines
of
fire
to
notice
the
naive
admiration
of
one
little
eve
concealed
in
a
group
of
women
marie
s
curiosity
like
that
which
would
undoubtedly
precipitate
all
paris
into
the
jardin
des
plantes
to
see
a
unicorn
if
such
an
animal
could
be
found
in
those
mountains
of
the
moon
still
virgin
of
the
tread
of
europeans
intoxicates
a
secondary
mind
as
much
as
it
saddens
great
ones
but
raoul
was
enchanted
by
it
although
he
was
then
too
anxious
to
secure
all
women
to
care
very
much
for
one
alone
take
care
my
dear
said
marie
s
kind
and
gracious
companion
in
her
ear
and
go
the
countess
looked
at
her
husband
to
ask
for
his
arm
with
one
of
those
glances
which
husbands
do
not
always
understand
felix
did
so
and
took
her
home
my
dear
friend
said
madame
d
espard
in
raoul
s
ear
you
are
a
lucky
fellow
you
have
made
more
than
one
conquest
and
among
them
that
of
the
charming
woman
who
has
just
left
us
so
do
you
know
what
the
marquise
d
espard
meant
by
that
said
raoul
to
rastignac
when
they
happened
to
be
comparatively
alone
between
one
and
two
o
clock
in
the
morning
i
am
told
that
the
comtesse
de
vandenesse
has
taken
a
violent
fancy
to
you
you
are
not
to
be
pitied
said
rastignac
i
did
not
see
her
said
raoul
oh
but
you
will
see
her
you
scamp
cried
emile
blondet
who
was
standing
by
lady
dudley
is
going
to
ask
you
to
her
grand
ball
that
you
may
meet
the
pretty
raoul
and
blondet
went
off
with
rastignac
who
offered
them
his
carriage
all
three
laughed
at
the
combination
of
an
eclectic
of
state
a
ferocious
republican
and
a
political
atheist
suppose
we
sup
at
the
expense
of
the
present
order
of
things
said
blondet
who
would
fain
recall
suppers
to
fashion
rastignac
took
them
to
very
s
sent
away
his
carriage
and
all
three
sat
down
to
table
to
analyze
society
with
rabelaisian
laughs
during
the
supper
rastignac
and
blondet
advised
their
provisional
enemy
not
to
neglect
such
a
capital
chance
of
advancement
as
the
one
now
offered
to
him
the
two
roues
gave
him
in
fine
satirical
style
the
history
of
madame
felix
de
vandenesse
they
drove
the
scalpel
of
epigram
and
the
sharp
points
of
much
good
wit
into
that
innocent
girlhood
and
happy
marriage
blondet
congratulated
raoul
on
encountering
a
woman
guilty
of
nothing
worse
so
far
than
horrible
drawings
in
red
chalk
attenuated
slippers
embroidered
for
a
husband
sonatas
executed
with
the
best
intentions
a
girl
tied
to
her
mother
s
till
she
was
eighteen
trussed
for
religious
practices
seasoned
by
vandenesse
and
cooked
to
a
point
by
marriage
at
the
third
bottle
of
champagne
raoul
unbosomed
himself
as
he
had
never
done
before
in
his
life
my
friends
he
said
you
know
my
relations
with
florine
you
also
know
my
life
and
you
will
not
be
surprised
to
hear
me
say
that
i
am
absolutely
ignorant
of
what
a
countess
s
love
may
be
like
i
have
often
felt
mortified
that
i
a
poet
could
not
give
myself
a
beatrice
a
laura
except
in
poetry
a
pure
and
noble
woman
is
like
an
unstained
conscience
she
represents
us
to
ourselves
under
a
noble
form
elsewhere
we
may
soil
ourselves
but
with
her
we
are
always
proud
lofty
and
immaculate
elsewhere
we
lead
lives
with
her
we
breathe
the
calm
the
freshness
the
verdure
of
an
oasis
go
on
go
on
my
dear
fellow
cried
rastignac
twang
that
fourth
string
with
the
prayer
in
moses
like
raoul
remained
silent
with
fixed
eyes
apparently
musing
this
wretched
ministerial
apprentice
does
not
understand
me
he
said
after
a
moment
s
silence
so
while
the
poor
eve
in
the
rue
du
rocher
went
to
bed
in
the
sheets
of
shame
frightened
at
the
pleasure
with
which
she
had
listened
to
that
sham
great
poet
these
three
bold
minds
were
trampling
with
jests
over
the
tender
flowers
of
her
dawning
love
ah
if
women
only
knew
the
cynical
tone
that
such
men
so
humble
so
fawning
in
their
presence
take
behind
their
backs
how
they
sneer
at
what
they
say
they
adore
fresh
pure
gracious
being
how
the
scoffing
jester
disrobes
and
analyzes
her
but
even
so
the
more
she
loses
veils
the
more
her
beauty
shines
marie
was
at
this
moment
comparing
raoul
and
felix
without
imagining
the
danger
there
might
be
for
her
in
such
comparisons
nothing
could
present
a
greater
contrast
than
the
disorderly
vigorous
raoul
to
felix
de
vandenesse
who
cared
for
his
person
like
a
dainty
woman
wore
clothes
had
a
charming
desinvoltura
and
was
a
votary
of
english
nicety
to
which
in
earlier
days
lady
dudley
had
trained
him
marie
as
a
good
and
pious
woman
soon
forbade
herself
even
to
think
of
raoul
and
considered
that
she
was
a
monster
of
ingratitude
for
making
the
comparison
what
do
you
think
of
raoul
nathan
she
asked
her
husband
the
next
day
at
breakfast
he
is
something
of
a
charlatan
replied
felix
one
of
those
volcanoes
who
are
easily
calmed
down
with
a
little
madame
de
montcornet
makes
a
mistake
in
admitting
this
answer
annoyed
marie
all
the
more
because
felix
supported
his
opinion
with
certain
facts
relating
what
he
knew
of
raoul
nathan
s
life
a
precarious
existence
mixed
up
with
a
popular
actress
if
the
man
has
genius
he
said
in
conclusion
he
certainly
has
neither
the
constancy
nor
the
patience
which
sanctifies
it
and
makes
it
a
thing
divine
he
endeavors
to
impose
on
the
world
by
placing
himself
on
a
level
which
he
does
nothing
to
maintain
true
talent
and
honorable
talent
does
not
act
thus
men
who
possess
such
talent
follow
their
path
courageously
they
accept
its
pains
and
penalties
and
don
t
cover
them
with
a
woman
s
thought
is
endowed
with
incredible
elasticity
when
she
receives
a
knockdown
blow
she
bends
seems
crushed
and
then
renews
her
natural
shape
in
a
given
time
felix
is
no
doubt
right
thought
she
but
three
days
later
she
was
once
more
thinking
of
the
serpent
recalled
to
him
by
that
singular
emotion
painful
and
yet
sweet
which
the
first
sight
of
raoul
had
given
her
the
count
and
countess
went
to
lady
dudley
s
grand
ball
where
by
the
bye
de
marsay
appeared
in
society
for
the
last
time
he
died
about
two
months
later
leaving
the
reputation
of
a
great
statesman
because
as
blondet
remarked
he
was
incomprehensible
vandenesse
and
his
wife
again
met
raoul
nathan
at
this
ball
which
was
remarkable
for
the
meeting
of
several
personages
of
the
political
drama
who
were
not
a
little
astonished
to
find
themselves
together
it
was
one
of
the
first
solemnities
of
the
great
world
the
salons
presented
a
magnificent
spectacle
to
the
eye
flowers
diamonds
and
brilliant
all
emptied
all
resources
of
the
toilet
put
under
contribution
the
might
be
compared
to
one
of
those
choice
conservatories
where
rich
horticulturists
collect
the
most
superb
rarities
same
brilliancy
same
delicacy
of
texture
on
all
sides
white
or
tinted
gauzes
like
the
wings
of
the
airiest
crepes
laces
blondes
and
tulles
varied
as
the
fantasies
of
entomological
nature
dentelled
waved
and
scalloped
spider
s
webs
of
gold
and
silver
mists
of
silk
embroidered
by
fairy
fingers
plumes
colored
by
the
fire
of
the
tropics
drooping
from
haughty
heads
pearls
twined
in
braided
hair
shot
or
ribbed
or
brocaded
silks
as
though
the
genius
of
arabesque
had
presided
over
french
manufactures
all
this
luxury
was
in
harmony
with
the
beauties
collected
there
as
if
to
realize
a
the
eye
received
there
an
impression
of
the
whitest
shoulders
some
others
so
polished
as
to
seem
colandered
some
dewy
some
plump
and
satiny
as
though
rubens
had
prepared
their
flesh
in
short
all
shades
known
to
man
in
white
here
were
eyes
sparkling
like
onyx
or
turquoise
fringed
with
dark
lashes
faces
of
varied
outline
presenting
the
most
graceful
types
of
many
lands
foreheads
noble
and
majestic
or
softly
rounded
as
if
thought
ruled
or
flat
as
if
resistant
will
reigned
there
unconquered
beautiful
bosoms
swelling
as
george
iv
admired
them
or
widely
parted
after
the
fashion
of
the
eighteenth
century
or
pressed
together
as
louis
xv
required
some
shown
boldly
without
veils
others
covered
by
those
charming
pleated
chemisettes
which
raffaelle
painted
the
prettiest
feet
pointed
for
the
dance
the
slimmest
waists
encircled
in
the
waltz
stimulated
the
gaze
of
the
most
indifferent
person
present
the
murmur
of
sweet
voices
the
rustle
of
gowns
the
cadence
of
the
dance
the
whir
of
the
waltz
harmoniously
accompanied
the
music
a
fairy
s
wand
seemed
to
have
commanded
this
dazzling
revelry
this
melody
of
perfumes
these
iridescent
lights
glittering
from
crystal
chandeliers
or
sparkling
in
candelabra
this
assemblage
of
the
prettiest
women
in
their
prettiest
dresses
stood
out
upon
a
gloomy
background
of
men
in
black
coats
among
whom
the
eye
remarked
the
elegant
delicate
and
correctly
drawn
profile
of
nobles
the
ruddy
beards
and
grave
faces
of
englishmen
and
the
more
gracious
faces
of
the
french
aristocracy
all
the
orders
of
europe
glittered
on
the
breasts
or
hung
from
the
necks
of
these
men
examining
this
society
carefully
it
was
seen
to
present
not
only
the
brilliant
tones
and
colors
and
outward
adornment
but
to
have
a
soul
it
lived
it
felt
it
thought
hidden
passions
gave
it
a
physiognomy
mischievous
or
malignant
looks
were
exchanged
fair
and
giddy
girls
betrayed
desires
jealous
women
told
each
other
scandals
behind
their
fans
or
paid
exaggerated
compliments
society
anointed
curled
and
perfumed
gave
itself
up
to
social
gaiety
which
went
to
the
brain
like
a
heady
liquor
it
seemed
as
if
from
all
foreheads
as
well
as
from
all
hearts
ideas
and
sentiments
were
exhaling
which
presently
condensed
and
reacted
in
a
volume
on
the
coldest
persons
present
and
excited
them
at
the
most
animated
moment
of
this
intoxicating
party
in
a
corner
of
a
gilded
salon
where
certain
bankers
ambassadors
and
the
immoral
old
english
earl
lord
dudley
were
playing
cards
madame
felix
de
vandenesse
was
irresistibly
drawn
to
converse
with
raoul
nathan
possibly
she
yielded
to
that
which
sometimes
wrings
avowals
from
the
most
discreet
at
sight
of
such
a
fete
and
the
splendors
of
a
world
in
which
he
had
never
before
appeared
nathan
was
stirred
to
the
soul
by
fresh
ambition
seeing
rastignac
whose
younger
brother
had
just
been
made
bishop
at
years
of
age
and
whose
martial
de
la
was
a
minister
and
who
himself
was
of
state
and
about
to
marry
rumor
said
the
only
daughter
of
the
baron
de
nucingen
a
girl
with
an
illimitable
dot
seeing
moreover
in
the
diplomatic
body
an
obscure
writer
whom
he
had
formerly
known
translating
articles
in
foreign
journals
for
a
newspaper
turned
dynastic
since
also
professors
now
made
peers
of
france
he
felt
with
anguish
that
he
was
left
behind
on
a
bad
road
by
advocating
the
overthrow
of
this
new
aristocracy
of
lucky
talent
of
cleverness
crowned
by
success
and
of
real
merit
even
blondet
so
unfortunate
so
used
by
others
in
journalism
but
so
welcomed
here
who
could
if
he
liked
enter
a
career
of
public
service
through
the
influence
of
madame
de
montcornet
seemed
to
nathan
s
eyes
a
striking
example
of
the
power
of
social
relations
secretly
in
his
heart
he
resolved
to
play
the
game
of
political
opinions
like
de
marsay
rastignac
blondet
talleyrand
the
leader
of
this
set
of
men
to
rely
on
facts
only
turn
them
to
his
own
profit
regard
his
system
as
a
weapon
and
not
interfere
with
a
society
so
well
constituted
so
shrewd
so
natural
my
influence
he
thought
will
depend
on
the
influence
of
some
woman
belonging
to
this
class
of
with
this
thought
in
his
mind
conceived
by
the
flame
of
this
frenzied
desire
he
fell
upon
the
comtesse
de
vandenesse
like
a
hawk
on
its
prey
that
charming
young
woman
in
her
of
marabouts
which
produced
the
delightful
flou
of
the
paintings
of
lawrence
and
harmonized
well
with
her
gentle
nature
was
penetrated
through
and
through
by
the
foaming
vigor
of
this
poet
wild
with
ambition
lady
dudley
whom
nothing
escaped
aided
this
by
throwing
the
comte
de
vandenesse
with
madame
de
manerville
strong
in
her
former
ascendancy
over
him
natalie
de
manerville
amused
herself
by
leading
felix
into
the
mazes
of
a
quarrel
of
witty
teasing
blushing
regrets
coyly
flung
like
flowers
at
his
feet
recriminations
in
which
she
excused
herself
for
the
sole
purpose
of
being
put
in
the
wrong
these
former
lovers
were
speaking
to
each
other
for
the
first
time
since
their
rupture
and
while
her
husband
s
former
love
was
stirring
the
embers
to
see
if
a
spark
were
yet
alive
madame
felix
de
vandenesse
was
undergoing
those
violent
palpitations
which
a
woman
feels
at
the
certainty
of
doing
wrong
and
stepping
on
forbidden
ground
emotions
that
are
not
without
charm
and
which
awaken
various
dormant
faculties
women
are
fond
of
using
bluebeard
s
bloody
key
that
fine
mythological
idea
for
which
we
are
indebted
to
perrault
the
dramatist
who
knew
his
shakespeare
displayed
his
wretchedness
related
his
struggle
with
men
and
things
made
his
hearer
aware
of
his
baseless
grandeur
his
unrecognized
political
genius
his
life
without
noble
affections
without
saying
a
single
definite
word
he
contrived
to
suggest
to
this
charming
woman
that
she
should
play
the
noble
part
of
rebecca
in
ivanhoe
and
love
and
protect
him
it
was
all
of
course
in
the
ethereal
regions
of
sentiment
are
not
more
blue
lilies
not
more
white
than
the
images
thoughts
and
radiantly
illumined
brow
of
this
accomplished
artist
who
was
likely
to
send
his
conversation
to
a
publisher
he
played
his
part
of
reptile
to
this
poor
eve
so
cleverly
he
made
the
fatal
bloom
of
the
apple
so
dazzling
to
her
eyes
that
marie
left
the
filled
with
that
species
of
remorse
which
resembles
hope
flattered
in
all
her
vanities
stirred
to
every
corner
of
her
heart
caught
by
her
own
virtues
allured
by
her
native
pity
for
misfortune
perhaps
madame
de
manerville
had
taken
vandenesse
into
the
salon
where
his
wife
was
talking
with
nathan
perhaps
he
had
come
there
himself
to
fetch
marie
and
take
her
home
perhaps
his
conversation
with
his
former
flame
had
awakened
slumbering
griefs
certain
it
is
that
when
his
wife
took
his
arm
to
leave
the
she
saw
that
his
face
was
sad
and
his
look
serious
the
countess
wondered
if
he
was
displeased
with
her
no
sooner
were
they
seated
in
the
carriage
than
she
turned
to
felix
and
said
with
a
mischievous
smile
did
not
i
see
you
talking
half
the
evening
with
madame
de
manerville
felix
was
not
out
of
the
tangled
paths
into
which
his
wife
had
led
him
by
this
charming
little
quarrel
when
the
carriage
turned
into
their
this
was
marie
s
first
artifice
dictated
by
her
new
emotion
and
she
even
took
pleasure
in
triumphing
over
a
man
who
until
then
had
seemed
to
her
so
superior
chapter
florine
between
the
rue
and
the
rue
raoul
had
on
the
third
floor
of
an
ugly
and
narrow
house
in
the
passage
sandrie
a
poor
enough
lodging
cold
and
bare
where
he
lived
ostensibly
for
the
general
public
for
literary
neophytes
and
for
his
creditors
duns
and
other
annoying
persons
whom
he
kept
on
the
threshold
of
private
life
his
real
home
his
fine
existence
his
presentation
of
himself
before
his
friends
was
in
the
house
of
mademoiselle
florine
a
comedy
actress
where
for
ten
years
the
said
friends
journalists
certain
authors
and
writers
in
general
disported
themselves
in
the
society
of
equally
illustrious
actresses
for
ten
years
raoul
had
attached
himself
so
closely
to
this
woman
that
he
passed
more
than
half
his
life
with
her
he
took
all
his
meals
at
her
house
unless
he
had
some
friend
to
invite
or
an
invitation
to
dinner
elsewhere
to
consummate
corruption
florine
added
a
lively
wit
which
intercourse
with
artists
had
developed
and
practice
sharpened
day
by
day
wit
is
thought
to
be
a
quality
rare
in
comedians
it
is
so
natural
to
suppose
that
persons
who
spend
their
lives
in
showing
things
on
the
outside
have
nothing
within
but
if
we
reflect
on
the
small
number
of
actors
and
actresses
who
live
in
each
century
and
also
on
how
many
dramatic
authors
and
fascinating
women
this
population
has
supplied
relatively
to
its
numbers
it
is
allowable
to
refute
that
opinion
which
rests
and
apparently
will
rest
forever
on
a
criticism
made
against
dramatic
artists
namely
that
their
personal
sentiments
are
destroyed
by
the
plastic
presentation
of
passions
whereas
in
fact
they
put
into
their
art
only
their
gifts
of
mind
memory
and
imagination
great
artists
are
beings
who
to
quote
napoleon
can
cut
off
at
will
the
connection
which
nature
has
put
between
the
senses
and
thought
moliere
and
talma
in
their
old
age
were
more
in
love
than
ordinary
men
in
all
their
lives
accustomed
to
listen
to
journalists
who
guess
at
most
things
putting
two
and
two
together
to
writers
who
foresee
and
tell
all
that
they
see
accustomed
also
to
the
ways
of
certain
political
personages
who
watched
one
another
in
her
house
and
profited
by
all
admissions
florine
presented
in
her
own
person
a
mixture
of
devil
and

made
her

they
delighted
in
her
cool
her
anomalies
of

them
prodigiously
her

by
gallant
tributes
displayed
the
exaggerated
magnificence
of
women
who
caring
little
about
the
cost
of
things
care
only
for
the
things
themselves
and
give
them
the
value
of
their
own
caprices
women
who
will
break
a
fan
or
a
fit
for
queens
in
a
moment
of
passion
and
scream
with
rage
if
a
servant
breaks
a
saucer
from
which
their
poodle
drinks
florine
s
filled
with
her
most
distinguished
offerings
will
give
a
fair
idea
of
this
of
regal
and
fantastic
luxury
throughout
even
on
the
ceilings
it
was
panelled
in
oak
picked
out
here
and
there
by
lines
these
panels
were
framed
in
relief
with
figures
of

playing
with
fantastic
animals
among
which
the

danced
and

all
these

were
placed
about
without
the
slightest
symmetry
but
with
almost
imperceptible
art
on
the
of
exquisitely
carved
oak
there
was
nothing
except
a
strange
evidently
florentine
ivory
statuette
attributed
to
michael
angelo
representing
pan
discovering
a
woman
under
the
skin
of
a
young
shepherd
the
original
of
which
is
in

clock

inlaid
with
brass

in

of

panel
between
two
statuettes
undoubtedly
obtained
from
the
demolition
of
some
abbey
in
the
corners
of
the
room
on
pedestals
were
lamps
of
royal
magnificence
as
to
which
a
manufacturer
had
made
strong
remonstrance
against
adapting
his
lamps
to
japanese
vases
on
a
marvellous
sideboard
was
displayed
a
service
of
silver
plate
the
gift
of
an
english
lord
also
porcelains
in
high
relief
in
short
the
luxury
of
an
actress
who
has
no
other
property
than
her
furniture
the
bedroom
all
in
violet
was
a
dream
that
florine
had
indulged
from
her
debut
the
chief
features
of
which
were
curtains
of
violet
velvet
lined
with
white
silk
and
looped
over
tulle
a
ceiling
of
white
cashmere
with
violet
satin
rays
an
ermine
carpet
beside
the
bed
in
the
bed
the
curtains
of
which
resembled
a
lily
turned
upside
down
was
a
lantern
by
which
to
read
the
newspaper
plaudits
or
criticisms
before
they
appeared
in
the
morning
a
yellow
salon
its
effect
heightened
by
trimmings
of
the
color
of
florentine
bronze
was
in
harmony
with
the
rest
of
these
magnificences
a
further
description
of
which
would
make
our
pages
resemble
the
posters
of
an
auction
sale
to
find
comparisons
for
all
these
fine
things
it
would
be
necessary
to
go
to
a
certain
house
that
was
almost
next
door
belonging
to
a
rothschild
sophie
grignault
surnamed
florine
by
a
form
of
baptism
common
in
theatres
had
made
her
first
appearances
in
spite
of
her
beauty
on
very
inferior
boards
her
success
and
her
money
she
owed
to
raoul
nathan
this
association
of
their
two
fates
usual
enough
in
the
dramatic
and
literary
world
did
no
harm
to
raoul
who
kept
up
the
outward
conventions
of
a
man
of
the
world
moreover
florine
s
actual
means
were
precarious
her
revenues
came
from
her
salary
and
her
leaves
of
absence
and
barely
sufficed
for
her
dress
and
her
household
expenses
nathan
gave
her
certain
perquisites
which
he
managed
to
levy
as
critic
on
several
of
the
new
enterprises
of
industrial
art
but
although
he
was
always
gallant
and
protecting
towards
her
that
protection
had
nothing
regular
or
solid
about
it
this
uncertainty
and
this
life
on
a
bough
as
it
were
did
not
alarm
florine
she
believed
in
her
talent
and
she
believed
in
her
beauty
her
robust
faith
was
somewhat
comical
to
those
who
heard
her
staking
her
future
upon
it
when
remonstrances
were
made
to
her
i
can
have
income
enough
when
i
please
she
was
wont
to
say
i
have
invested
fifty
francs
on
the
no
one
could
ever
understand
how
it
happened
that
florine
handsome
as
she
was
had
remained
in
obscurity
for
seven
years
but
the
fact
is
florine
was
enrolled
as
a
supernumerary
at
thirteen
years
of
age
and
made
her
debut
two
years
later
at
an
obscure
boulevard
theatre
at
fifteen
neither
beauty
nor
talent
exist
a
woman
is
simply
all
promise
she
was
now
the
age
at
which
the
beauties
of
a
french
woman
are
in
their
glory
painters
particularly
admired
the
lustre
of
her
white
shoulders
tinted
with
olive
tones
about
the
nape
of
the
neck
and
wonderfully
firm
and
polished
so
that
the
light
shimmered
over
them
as
it
does
on
watered
silk
when
she
turned
her
head
superb
folds
formed
about
her
neck
the
admiration
of
sculptors
she
carried
on
this
triumphant
neck
the
small
head
of
a
roman
empress
the
delicate
round
and
head
of
pompeia
with
features
of
elegant
correctness
and
the
smooth
forehead
of
a
woman
who
drives
all
care
away
and
all
reflection
who
yields
easily
but
is
capable
of
balking
like
a
mule
and
incapable
at
such
times
of
listening
to
reason
that
forehead
turned
as
it
were
with
one
cut
of
the
chisel
brought
out
the
beauty
of
the
golden
hair
which
was
raised
in
front
after
the
roman
fashion
in
two
equal
masses
and
twisted
up
behind
the
head
to
prolong
the
line
of
the
neck
and
enhance
that
whiteness
by
its
beautiful
color
black
and
delicate
eyebrows
drawn
by
a
chinese
brush
encircled
the
soft
eyelids
which
were
threaded
with
rosy
fibres
the
pupils
of
the
eyes
extremely
bright
though
striped
with
brown
rays
gave
to
her
glance
the
cruel
fixity
of
a
beast
of
prey
and
betrayed
the
cold
maliciousness
of
the
courtesan
the
eyes
were
gray
fringed
with
black
lashes
a
charming
contrast
which
made
their
expression
of
calm
and
contemplative
voluptuousness
the
more
observable
the
circle
round
the
eyes
showed
marks
of
fatigue
but
the
artistic
manner
in
which
she
could
turn
her
eyeballs
right
and
left
or
up
and
down
to
observe
or
seem
to
mediate
the
way
in
which
she
could
hold
them
fixed
casting
out
their
vivid
fire
without
moving
her
head
without
taking
from
her
face
its
absolute
immovability
a
manoeuvre
learned
upon
the
stage
and
the
vivacity
of
their
glance
as
she
looked
about
a
theatre
in
search
of
a
friend
made
her
eyes
the
most
terrible
also
the
softest
in
short
the
most
extraordinary
eyes
in
the
world
rouge
had
destroyed
by
this
time
the
diaphanous
tints
of
her
cheeks
the
flesh
of
which
was
still
delicate
but
although
she
could
no
longer
blush
or
turn
pale
she
had
a
thin
nose
with
rosy
passionate
nostrils
made
to
express
irony
the
mocking
irony
of
moliere
s
her
sensual
mouth
expressive
of
sarcasm
and
love
of
dissipation
was
adorned
with
a
deep
furrow
that
united
the
upper
lip
with
the
nose
her
chin
white
and
rather
fat
betrayed
the
violence
of
passion
her
hands
and
arms
were
worthy
of
a
sovereign
but
she
had
one
ineradicable
sign
of
low
birth
her
foot
was
short
and
fat
no
inherited
quality
ever
caused
greater
distress
florine
had
tried
everything
short
of
amputation
to
get
rid
of
it
the
feet
were
obstinate
like
the
breton
race
from
which
she
came
they
resisted
all
treatment
florine
now
wore
long
boots
stuffed
with
cotton
to
give
length
and
the
semblance
of
an
instep
her
figure
was
of
medium
height
threatened
with
corpulence
but
still
and
morally
she
was
an
adept
in
all
the
attitudinizing
quarrelling
alluring
and
cajoling
of
her
business
and
she
gave
to
those
actions
a
savor
of
their
own
by
playing
childlike
innocence
and
slipping
in
among
her
artless
speeches
philosophical
malignities
apparently
ignorant
and
giddy
she
was
very
strong
on
and
commercial
law
for
the
reason
that
she
had
gone
through
so
much
misery
before
attaining
to
her
present
precarious
success
she
had
come
down
story
by
story
from
the
garret
to
the
first
floor
through
so
many
vicissitudes
she
knew
life
from
that
which
begins
in
brie
cheese
and
ends
at
pineapples
from
that
which
cooks
and
washes
in
the
corner
of
a
garret
on
an
earthenware
stove
to
that
which
convokes
the
tribes
of
chefs
and
saucemakers
she
had
lived
on
credit
and
not
killed
it
she
was
ignorant
of
nothing
that
honest
women
ignore
she
spoke
all
languages
she
was
one
of
the
populace
by
experience
she
was
noble
by
beauty
and
physical
distinction
suspicious
as
a
spy
or
a
judge
or
an
old
statesman
she
was
difficult
to
impose
upon
and
therefore
the
more
able
to
see
clearly
into
most
matters
she
knew
the
ways
of
managing
tradespeople
and
how
to
evade
their
snares
and
she
was
quite
as
well
versed
in
the
prices
of
things
as
a
public
appraiser
to
see
her
lying
on
her
sofa
like
a
young
bride
fresh
and
white
holding
her
part
in
her
hand
and
learning
it
you
would
have
thought
her
a
child
of
sixteen
ingenuous
ignorant
and
weak
with
no
other
artifice
about
her
but
her
innocence
let
a
creditor
contrive
to
enter
and
she
was
up
like
a
startled
fawn
and
swearing
a
good
round
oath
hey
my
good
fellow
your
insolence
is
too
dear
an
interest
on
the
money
i
owe
you
she

of

charming

where

ran

her
female
friends
were
all
handsome
no
old
woman
had
ever
appeared
within
her
precincts
she
was
not
jealous
in
fact
she
would
have
thought
jealousy
an
admission
of
inferiority
she
had
known
coralie
and
la

in
their
lifetimes
and
now
knew

through

like

through

without
our
knowing
where
they
go
nor
whence
they
came
queens
slaves
she
also
knew
the
actresses
her
rivals
and
all
the
in
short
that
whole
exceptional
feminine
society
so
kindly
so
graceful
in
its
easy
which
absorbs
into
its
own
bohemian
life
all
who
allow
themselves
to
be
caught
in
the
frantic
whirl
of
its
gay
spirits
its
eager
abandonment
and
its
contemptuous
indifference
to
the
future
though
this
bohemian
life
displayed
itself
in
her
house
in
tumultuous
disorder
amid
the
laughter
of
artists
of
every
description
the
queen
of
the
revels
had
ten
fingers
on
which
she
knew
better
how
to
count
than
any
of
her
guests
in
that
house
secret
saturnalias
of
literature
and
art
politics
and
finance
were
carried
on
there
desire
reigned
a
sovereign
there
caprice
and
fancy
were

of

collected
about

they
all
hated

liked

another
according

circumstances
this
bohemian
resort
to
which
celebrity
was
the
only
ticket
of
admission
was
a
hades
of
the
mind

of

no

could

without

there

of
making
fortune
scrutinized
all
things
were
discussed
and
weighed
but
every
man
on
leaving
it
resumed
the
livery
of
his
own
opinions
there
he
could
without
compromising
himself
criticise
his
own
party
admit
the
knowledge
and
good

of

formulate
thoughts

therefore
it
is
not

certain
that

will
remain
to
the
end

a
actress
florine
s
life
was
by
no
means
an
idle
one
or
a
life
to
be
envied
many
persons
misled
by
the
magnificent
pedestal
that
the
stage
gives
to
a
woman
suppose
her
in
the
midst
of
a
perpetual
carnival
in
the
dark
recesses
of
a
porter
s
lodge
beneath
the
tiles
of
an
attic
roof
many
a
poor
girl
dreams
on
returning
from
the
theatre
of
pearls
and
diamonds
gowns
and
sumptuous
girdles
she
fancies
herself
adored
applauded
courted
but
little
she
knows
of
that
treadmill
life
in
which
the
actress
is
forced
to
rehearsals
under
pain
of
fines
to
the
reading
of
new
pieces
to
the
constant
study
of
new
roles
at
each
representation
florine
changes
her
dress
at
least
two
or
three
times
often
she
comes
home
exhausted
and
but
before
she
can
rest
she
must
wash
off
with
various
cosmetics
the
white
and
the
red
she
has
applied
and
clean
all
the
powder
from
her
hair
if
she
has
played
a
part
from
the
eighteenth
century
she
scarcely
has
time
for
food
when
she
plays
an
actress
can
live
no
life
of
her
own
she
can
neither
dress
nor
eat
nor
talk
florine
often
has
no
time
to
sup
on
returning
from
a
play
which
lasts
in
these
days
till
after
midnight
she
does
not
get
to
bed
before
two
in
the
morning
but
she
must
rise
early
to
study
her
part
order
her
dresses
try
them
on

read

them
discuss

for
the
triumphs
of
the
last

in

and
bespeak
those
of

ahead
in
the
days
of
the
canonized
comedian
who
fulfilled
his
duties
in
a
pious
manner
and
wore
a
hair

we
must
suppose
that
an
actor
s
life
did
not
demand
this
incessant
activity
sometimes

with
a
bourgeois

get
out

in
these
infernal
coulisses
has
no
sex
the
artist
who
triumphs
be
it
man
or
woman
has
all
the
other
men
and
women
against
him
or
her
then
as
to
money
however
many
engagements
florine
may
have
her
salary
does
not
cover
the
costs
of
her
stage
toilet
which
in
addition
to
its
costumes
requires
an
immense
variety
of
long
gloves
shoes
and
frippery
and
all
this
exclusive
of
her
personal
clothing
the
first
third
of
such
a
life
is
spent
in
struggling
and
imploring
the
next
third
in
getting
a
foothold
the
last
third
in
defending
it
if
happiness
is
frantically
grasped
it
is
because
it
is
so
rare
so
long
desired
and
found
at
last
only
amid
the
odious
fictitious
pleasures
and
smiles
of
such
a
life
as
for
florine
raoul
s
power
in
the
press
was
like
a
protecting
sceptre
he
spared
her
many
cares
and
anxieties
she
clung
to
him
less
as
a
lover
than
a
prop
she
took
care
of
him
like
a
father
she
deceived
him
like
a
husband
but
she
would
readily
have
sacrificed
all
she
had
to
him
raoul
could
and
did
do
everything
for
her
vanity
as
an
actress
for
the
peace
of
her
and
for
her
future
on
the
stage
without
the
intervention
of
a
successful
author
there
is
no
successful
actress
champmesle
was
due
to
racine
like
mars
to
monvel
and
andrieux
florine
could
do
nothing
in
return
for
raoul
though
she
would
gladly
have
been
useful
and
necessary
to
him
she
reckoned
on
the
charms
of
habit
to
keep
him
by
her
she
was
always
ready
to
open
her
salons
and
display
the
luxury
of
her
dinners
and
suppers
for
his
friends
and
to
further
his
projects
she
desired
to
be
for
him
what
madame
de
pompadour
was
to
louis
xv
all
actresses
envied
florine
s
position
and
some
journalists
envied
that
of
raoul
those
to
whom
the
inclination
of
the
human
mind
towards
chance
opposition
and
contrasts
is
known
will
readily
understand
that
after
ten
years
of
this
lawless
bohemian
life
full
of
ups
and
downs
of
fetes
and
sheriffs
of
orgies
and
forced
sobrieties
raoul
was
attracted
to
the
idea
of
another
love
to
the
gentle
harmonious
house
and
presence
of
a
great
lady
just
as
the
comtesse
felix
instinctively
desired
to
introduce
the
torture
of
great
emotions
into
a
life
made
monotonous
by
happiness
this
law
of
life
is
the
law
of
all
arts
which
exist
only
by
contrasts
a
work
done
without
this
incentive
is
the
loftiest
expression
of
genius
just
as
the
cloister
is
the
highest
expression
of
the
christian
life
on
returning
to
his
lodging
from
lady
dudley
s
ball
raoul
found
a
note
from
florine
brought
by
her
maid
which
an
invincible
sleepiness
prevented
him
from
reading
at
that
moment
he
fell
asleep
dreaming
of
a
gentle
love
that
his
life
had
so
far
lacked
some
hours
later
he
opened
the
note
and
found
in
it
important
news
which
neither
rastignac
nor
de
marsay
had
allowed
to
transpire
the
indiscretion
of
a
member
of
the
government
had
revealed
to
the
actress
the
coming
dissolution
of
the
chamber
after
the
present
session
raoul
instantly
went
to
florine
s
house
and
sent
for
blondet
in
the
actress
s
boudoir
with
their
feet
on
the
fender
emile
and
raoul
analyzed
the
political
situation
of
france
in
on
which
side
lay
the
best
chance
of
fortune
they
reviewed
all
parties
and
all
shades
of
party
pure
republicans
presiding
republicans
republicans
without
a
republic
constitutionals
without
a
dynasty
ministerial
conservatives
ministerial
absolutists
also
the
right
the
aristocratic
right
the
legitimist
henriquinquist
right
and
the
carlist
right
between
the
party
of
resistance
and
that
of
action
there
was
no
discussion
they
might
as
well
have
hesitated
between
life
and
death
at
this
period
a
flock
of
newspapers
created
to
represent
all
shades
of
opinion
produced
a
fearful
of
political
principles
blondet
the
most
judicious
mind
of
the
day
judicious
for
others
never
for
himself
like
some
great
lawyers
unable
to
manage
their
own
affairs
was
magnificent
in
such
a
discussion
the
upshot
was
that
he
advised
nathan
not
to
apostatize
too
suddenly
napoleon
said
it
you
can
t
make
young
republics
of
old
monarchies
therefore
my
dear
fellow
become
the
hero
the
support
the
creator
of
the
left
centre
in
the
new
chamber
and
you
ll
succeed
once
admitted
into
political
ranks
once
in
the
government
you
can
be
what
you
like
of
any
opinion
that
nathan
was
bent
on
creating
a
daily
political
journal
and
becoming
the
absolute
master
of
an
enterprise
which
should
absorb
into
it
the
countless
little
papers
then
swarming
from
the
press
and
establish
ramifications
with
a
review
he
had
seen
so
many
fortunes
made
all
around
him
by
the
press
that
he
would
not
listen
to
blondet
who
warned
him
not
to
trust
to
such
a
venture
declaring
that
the
plan
was
unsound
so
great
was
the
present
number
of
newspapers
all
fighting
for
subscribers
raoul
relying
on
his
friends
and
his
own
courage
was
all
for
daring
it
he
sprang
up
eagerly
and
said
with
a
proud
gesture
i
shall
but
you
haven
t
a
i
will
write
a
it
will
let
it
fail
replied
nathan
he
rushed
through
the
various
rooms
of
florine
s
apartment
followed
by
blondet
who
thought
him
crazy
looking
with
a
greedy
eye
upon
the
wealth
displayed
there
blondet
understood
that
look
there
s
a
hundred
and
more
thousand
francs
in
them
he
remarked
yes
said
raoul
sighing
as
he
looked
at
florine
s
sumptuous
bedstead
but
i
d
rather
be
a
pedler
all
my
life
on
the
boulevard
and
live
on
fried
potatoes
than
sell
one
item
of
this
not
one
item
said
blondet
sell
all
ambition
is
like
death
it
takes
all
or
no
a
hundred
times
no
i
would
take
anything
from
my
new
countess
but
rob
florine
of
her
shell
upset
our
break
one
s
smash
our
refuge
yes
that
would
be
serious
said
blondet
with
a
tragic
air
it
seems
to
me
from
what
i
hear
that
you
want
to
play
politics
instead
of
comedies
said
florine
suddenly
appearing
yes
my
dear
yes
said
raoul
affectionately
taking
her
by
the
neck
and
kissing
her
forehead
don
t
make
faces
at
that
you
won
t
lose
anything
a
minister
can
do
better
than
a
journalist
for
the
queen
of
the
boards
what
parts
and
what
holidays
you
shall
have
where
will
you
get
the
money
she
said
from
my
uncle
replied
raoul
florine
knew
raoul
s
the
word
meant
usury
as
in
popular
parlance
aunt
means
pawn
don
t
worry
yourself
my
little
darling
said
blondet
to
florine
tapping
her
shoulder
i
ll
get
him
the
assistance
of
massol
a
lawyer
who
wants
to
be
deputy
also
finot
who
has
never
yet
got
beyond
his
and
pantin
who
wants
to
be
master
of
petitions
and
who
dabbles
in
reviews
yes
i
ll
save
him
from
himself
we
ll
convoke
here
to
supper
etienne
lousteau
who
can
do
the
feuilleton
claude
vignon
for
criticisms
felicien
vernou
as
general
the
lawyer
will
work
and
du
tillet
may
take
charge
of
the
bourse
the
money
article
and
all
industrial
questions
we
ll
see
where
these
various
talents
and
slaves
united
will
land
the
in
a
hospital
or
a
ministry
where
all
men
ruined
in
body
or
mind
are
apt
to
go
said
raoul
laughing
where
and
when
shall
we
invite
them
here
five
days
tell
me
the
sum
you
want
said
florine
simply
well
the
lawyer
du
tillet
and
raoul
will
each
have
to
put
up
a
hundred
thousand
francs
before
they
embark
on
the
affair
replied
blondet
then
the
paper
can
run
eighteen
months
about
long
enough
for
a
rise
and
fall
in
florine
gave
a
little
grimace
of
approval
the
two
friends
jumped
into
a
cabriolet
to
go
about
collecting
guests
and
pens
ideas
and
florine
meantime
sent
for
certain
dealers
in
old
furniture
pictures
and
jewels
these
men
entered
her
sanctuary
and
took
an
inventory
of
every
article
precisely
as
if
florine
were
dead
she
declared
she
would
sell
everything
at
public
auction
if
they
did
not
offer
her
a
proper
price
she
had
had
the
luck
to
please
she
said
an
english
lord
and
she
wanted
to
get
rid
of
all
her
property
and
look
poor
so
that
he
might
give
her
a
fine
house
and
furniture
fit
to
rival
the
rothschilds
but
in
spite
of
these
persuasions
and
subterfuges
all
the
dealers
would
offer
her
for
a
mass
of
belongings
worth
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
was
seventy
thousand
florine
thereupon
offered
to
deliver
over
everything
in
eight
days
for
eighty
thousand
to
take
or
leave
she
said
and
the
bargain
was
concluded
after
the
men
had
departed
she
skipped
for
joy
like
the
hills
of
king
david
and
performed
all
manner
of
follies
not
having
thought
herself
so
rich
when
raoul
came
back
she
made
him
a
little
scene
pretending
to
be
hurt
she
declared
that
he
abandoned
her
that
she
had
reflected
men
did
not
pass
from
one
party
to
another
from
the
stage
to
the
chamber
without
some
reason
there
was
a
woman
at
the
bottom
she
had
a
rival
in
short
she
made
him
swear
eternal
fidelity
five
days
later
she
gave
a
splendid
feast
the
new
journal
was
baptized
in
floods
of
wine
and
wit
with
oaths
of
loyalty
fidelity
and
the
name
forgotten
now
like
those
of
the
liberal
communal
departmental
garde
national
federal
impartial
was
something
in
al
that
was
equally
imposing
and
evanescent
at
three
in
the
morning
florine
could
undress
and
go
to
bed
as
if
alone
though
no
one
had
left
the
house
these
lights
of
the
epoch
were
sleeping
the
sleep
of
brutes
and
when
early
in
the
morning
the
packers
and
vans
arrived
to
remove
florine
s
treasures
she
laughed
to
see
the
porters
moving
the
bodies
of
the
celebrated
men
like
pieces
of
furniture
that
lay
in
their
way
sic
transit
all
her
fine
things
all
her
presents
and
souvenirs
went
to
the
shops
of
the
various
dealers
where
no
one
on
seeing
them
would
know
how
those
flowers
of
luxury
had
been
originally
paid
for
it
was
agreed
that
a
few
little
necessary
articles
should
be
left
for
florine
s
personal
convenience
until
evening
her
bed
a
table
a
few
chairs
and
china
enough
to
give
her
guests
their
breakfast
having
gone
to
sleep
beneath
the
draperies
of
wealth
and
luxury
these
distinguished
men
awoke
to
find
themselves
within
bare
walls
full
of
degraded
into
abject
poverty
why
florine
the
poor
girl
has
been
seized
for
debt
cried
bixiou
who
was
one
of
the
guests
quick
a
subscription
for
her
on
this
they
all
roused
up
every
pocket
was
emptied
and
produced
a
total
of
francs
which
raoul
carried
in
jest
to
florine
s
bedside
she
burst
out
laughing
and
lifted
her
pillow
beneath
which
lay
a
mass
of
to
which
she
pointed
raoul
called
to
blondet
ah
i
see
cried
blondet
the
little
cheat
has
sold
herself
out
without
a
word
to
us
well
done
you
little
angel
thereupon
the
actress
was
borne
in
triumph
into
the
where
most
of
the
party
still
remained
the
lawyer
and
du
tillet
had
departed
that
evening
florine
had
an
ovation
at
the
theatre
the
story
of
her
sacrifice
had
circulated
among
the
audience
i
d
rather
be
applauded
for
my
talent
said
her
rival
in
the
a
natural
desire
in
an
actress
who
has
never
been
applauded
at
all
remarked
florine
during
the
evening
florine
s
maid
installed
her
in
raoul
s
apartment
in
the
passage
sandrie
raoul
himself
was
to
encamp
in
the
house
where
the
office
of
the
new
journal
was
established
such
was
the
rival
of
the
innocent
madame
de
vandenesse
raoul
was
the
connecting
link
between
the
actress
and
the
countess
a
knot
severed
by
a
duchess
in
the
days
of
louis
xv
by
the
poisoning
of
adrienne
lecouvreur
a
not
inconceivable
vengeance
considering
the
offence
florine
however
was
not
in
the
way
of
raoul
s
dawning
passion
she
foresaw
the
lack
of
money
in
the
difficult
enterprise
he
had
undertaken
and
she
asked
for
leave
of
absence
from
the
theatre
raoul
conducted
the
negotiation
in
a
way
to
make
himself
more
than
ever
valuable
to
her
with
the
good
sense
of
the
peasant
in
la
fontaine
s
fable
who
makes
sure
of
a
dinner
while
the
patricians
talk

into

chapter
vi
romantic
love
on
the
morrow
of
the
ball
given
by
lady
dudley
marie
without
having
received
the
slightest
declaration
believed
that
she
was
loved
by
raoul
according
to
the
programme
of
her
dreams
and
raoul
was
aware
that
the
countess
had
chosen
him
for
her
lover
though
neither
had
reached
the
incline
of
such
emotions
where
preliminaries
are
abridged
both
were
on
the
road
to
it
raoul
wearied
with
the
dissipations
of
life
longed
for
an
ideal
world
while
marie
from
whom
the
thought
of
was
far
indeed
never
imagined
the
possibility
of
going
out
of
such
a
world
no
love
was
ever
more
innocent
or
purer
than
theirs
but
none
was
ever
more
enthusiastic
or
more
entrancing
in
thought
the
countess
was
captivated
by
ideas
worthy
of
the
days
of
chivalry
though
completely
modernized
the
glowing
conversation
of
the
poet
had
more
echo
in
her
mind
than
in
her
heart
she
thought
it
fine
to
be
his
providence
how
sweet
the
thought
of
supporting
by
her
white
and
feeble
hand
this
colossus
whose
feet
of
clay
she
did
not
choose
to
see
of
giving
life
where
life
was
needed
of
being
secretly
the
creator
of
a
career
of
helping
a
man
of
genius
to
struggle
with
fate
and
master
it
ah
to
embroider
his
scarf
for
the
tournament
to
procure
him
weapons
to
be
his
talisman
against
his
balm
for
every
wound
for
a
woman
brought
up
like
marie
religious
and
noble
as
she
was
such
a
love
was
a
form
of
charity
hence
the
boldness
of
it
pure
sentiments
often
compromise
themselves
with
a
lofty
disdain
that
resembles
the
boldness
of
courtesans
as
soon
as
by
her
specious
distinctions
marie
had
convinced
herself
that
she
did
not
in
any
way
impair
her
conjugal
faith
she
rushed
into
the
happiness
of
loving
raoul
the
least
little
things
of
her
daily
life
acquired
a
charm
her
boudoir
where
she
thought
of
him
became
a
sanctuary
there
was
nothing
there
that
did
not
rouse
some
sense
of
pleasure
even
her
was
the
coming
accomplice
in
the
pleasures
of
correspondence
for
she
would
now
have
letters
to
read
and
answer
dress
that
splendid
poesy
of
the
feminine
life
unknown
or
exhausted
by
her
appeared
to
her
eyes
endowed
with
a
magic
hitherto
unperceived
it
suddenly
became
clear
to
her
what
it
is
to
most
women
the
manifestation
of
an
inward
thought
a
language
a
symbol
how
many
enjoyments
in
a
toilet
arranged
to
please
to
do
honor
she
gave
herself
up
ingenuously
to
all
those
gracefully
charming
things
in
which
so
many
parisian
women
spend
their
lives
and
which
give
such
significance
to
all
that
we
see
about
them
and
in
them
and
on
them
few
women
go
to
milliners
and
dressmakers
for
their
own
pleasure
and
interest
when
old
they
never
think
of
adornment
the
next
time
you
meet
in
the
street

young
woman
stopping
for
a
moment
to
look
into

her
face
carefully

on
that

eyes
sparkling
with
hope
in

lady
dudley
s
ball
took
place
on
a
saturday
night
on
the
following
monday
the
countess
went
to
the
opera
feeling
certain
of
seeing
raoul
who
was
in
fact
watching
for
her
on
one
of
the
stairways
leading
down
to
the
stalls
with
what
delight
did
she
observe
the
unwonted
care
he
had
bestowed
upon
his
clothes
this
despiser
of
the
laws
of
elegance
had
brushed
and
perfumed
his
hair
his
waistcoat
followed
the
fashion
his
cravat
was
well
tied
the
bosom
of
his
shirt
was
irreproachably
smooth
raoul
was
standing
with
his
arms
crossed
as
if
posed
for
his
portrait
magnificently
indifferent
to
the
rest
of
the
audience
and
full
of
repressed
impatience
though
lowered
his
eyes
were
turned
to
the
red
velvet
cushion
on
which
lay
marie
s
arm
felix
seated
in
the
opposite
corner
of
the
box
had
his
back
to
nathan
so
in
a
moment
as
it
were
marie
had
compelled
this
remarkable
man
to
abjure
his
cynicism
in
the
line
of
clothes
all
women
high
or
low
are
filled
with
delight
on
seeing
a
first
proof
of
their
power
in
one
of
these
sudden
metamorphoses
such
changes
are
an
admission
of
serfdom
those
women
were
right
there
is
a
great
pleasure
in
being
understood
she
said
to
herself
thinking
of
her
treacherous
friends
when
the
two
lovers
had
gazed
around
the
theatre
with
that
glance
that
takes
in
everything
they
exchanged
a
look
of
intelligence
it
was
for
each
as
if
some
celestial
dew
had
refreshed
their
hearts
with
expectation
i
have
been
here
for
an
hour
in
purgatory
but
now
the
heavens
are
opening
said
raoul
s
eyes
i
knew
you
were
waiting
but
how
could
i
help
it
replied
those
of
the
countess
thieves
spies
lovers
diplomats
and
slaves
of
any
kind
alone
know
the
resources
and
comforts
of
a
glance
they
alone
know
what
it
contains
of
meaning
sweetness
thought
anger
villainy
displayed
by
the
modification
of
that
ray
of
light
which
conveys
the
soul
between
the
box
of
the
comtesse
felix
de
vandenesse
and
the
step
on
which
raoul
had
perched
there
were
barely
thirty
feet
and
yet
it
was
impossible
to
wipe
out
that
distance
to
a
fiery
being
who
had
hitherto
known
no
space
between
his
wishes
and
their
gratification
this
imaginary
but
insuperable
gulf
inspired
a
mad
desire
to
spring
to
the
countess
with
the
bound
of
a
tiger
in
a
species
of
rage
he
determined
to
try
the
ground
and
bow
openly
to
the
countess
she
returned
the
bow
with
one
of
those
slight
inclinations
of
the
head
with
which
women
take
from
their
adorers
all
desire
to
continue
their
attempt
comte
felix
turned
round
to
see
who
had
bowed
to
his
wife
he
saw
nathan
but
did
not
bow
and
seemed
to
inquire
the
meaning
of
such
audacity
then
he
turned
back
slowly
and
said
a
few
words
to
his
wife
evidently
the
door
of
that
box
was
closed
to
nathan
who
cast
a
terrible
look
of
hatred
upon
felix
madame
d
espard
had
seen
the
whole
thing
from
her
box
which
was
just
above
where
raoul
was
standing
she
raised
her
voice
in
crying
bravo
to
some
singer
which
caused
nathan
to
look
up
to
her
he
bowed
and
received
in
return
a
gracious
smile
which
seemed
to
say
if
they
won
t
admit
you
there
come
here
to
raoul
obeyed
the
silent
summons
and
went
to
her
box
he
felt
the
need
of
showing
himself
in
a
place
which
might
teach
that
little
vandenesse
that
fame
was
every
whit
as
good
as
nobility
and
that
all
doors
turned
on
their
hinges
to
admit
him
the
marquise
made
him
sit
in
front
of
her
she
wanted
to
question
him
madame
felix
de
vandenesse
is
fascinating
in
that
gown
she
said
complimenting
the
dress
as
if
it
were
a
book
he
had
published
the
day
before
yes
said
raoul
indifferently
marabouts
are
very
becoming
to
her
but
she
seems
wedded
to
them
she
wore
them
on
saturday
he
added
in
a
careless
tone
as
if
to
repudiate
the
intimacy
madame
d
espard
was
fastening
upon
him
you
know
the
proverb
she
replied
there
is
no
good
fete
without
a
in
the
matter
of
repartees
literary
celebrities
are
often
not
as
quick
as
women
raoul
pretended
dulness
a
last
resort
for
clever
men
that
proverb
is
true
in
my
case
he
said
looking
gallantly
at
the
marquise
my
dear
friend
your
speech
comes
too
late
i
can
t
accept
it
she
said
laughing
don
t
be
so
prudish
come
i
know
how
it
was
you
complimented
madame
de
vandenesse
at
the
ball
on
her
marabouts
and
she
has
put
them
on
again
for
your
sake
she
likes
you
and
you
adore
her
it
may
be
a
little
rapid
but
it
is
all
very
natural
if
i
were
mistaken
you
wouldn
t
be
twisting
your
gloves
like
a
man
who
is
furious
at
having
to
sit
here
with
me
instead
of
flying
to
the
box
of
his
idol
she
has
obtained
continued
madame
d
espard
glancing
at
his
person
impertinently
certain
sacrifices
which
you
refused
to
make
to
society
she
ought
to
be
delighted
with
her
success
in
fact
i
have
no
doubt
she
is
vain
of
it
i
should
be
so
in
her
place
immensely
she
was
never
a
woman
of
any
mind
but
she
may
now
pass
for
one
of
genius
i
am
sure
you
will
describe
her
in
one
of
those
delightful
novels
you
write
and
pray
don
t
forget
vandenesse
put
him
in
to
please
me
really
his
is
too
much
i
can
t
stand
that
jupiter
olympian
air
of
his
the
only
mythological
character
exempt
they
say
from
madame
cried
raoul
you
rate
my
soul
very
low
if
you
think
me
capable
of
trafficking
with
my
feelings
my
affections
rather
than
commit
such
literary
baseness
i
would
do
as
they
do
in
england
put
a
rope
round
a
woman
s
neck
and
sell
her
in
the
but
i
know
marie
she
would
like
you
to
do
she
is
incapable
of
liking
it
said
raoul
vehemently
oh
then
you
do
know
her
well
nathan
laughed
he
the
maker
of
scenes
to
be
trapped
into
playing
one
himself
comedy
is
no
longer
there
he
said
nodding
at
the
stage
it
is
here
in
he
took
his
and
looked
about
the
theatre
to
recover
countenance
you
are
not
angry
with
me
i
hope
said
the
marquise
giving
him
a
sidelong
glance
i
should
have
had
your
secret
somehow
let
us
make
peace
come
and
see
me
i
receive
every
wednesday
and
i
am
sure
the
dear
countess
will
never
miss
an
evening
if
i
let
her
know
you
will
be
there
so
i
shall
be
the
gainer
sometimes
she
comes
between
four
and
five
o
clock
and
i
ll
be
kind
and
add
you
to
the
little
set
of
favorites
i
admit
at
that
ah
cried
raoul
how
the
world
judges
it
calls
you
so
i
am
when
i
need
to
be
she
replied
we
must
defend
ourselves
but
your
countess
i
adore
you
will
be
contented
with
her
she
is
charming
your
name
will
be
the
first
engraved
upon
her
heart
with
that
infantine
joy
that
makes
a
lad
cut
the
initials
of
his
love
on
the
barks
of
raoul
was
aware
of
the
danger
of
such
conversations
in
which
a
parisian
woman
excels
he
feared
the
marquise
would
extract
some
admission
from
him
which
she
would
instantly
turn
into
ridicule
among
her
friends
he
therefore
withdrew
prudently
as
lady
dudley
entered
well
said
the
englishwoman
to
the
marquise
how
far
have
they
got
they
are
madly
in
love
he
has
just
told
me
i
wish
he
were
uglier
said
lady
dudley
with
a
viperish
look
at
comte
felix
in
other
respects
he
is
just
what
i
want
him
the
son
of
a
jew
broker
who
died
a
bankrupt
soon
after
his
marriage
but
the
mother
was
a
catholic
and
i
am
sorry
to
say
she
made
a
christian
of
the
this
origin
which
nathan
thought
carefully
concealed
lady
dudley
had
just
discovered
and
she
enjoyed
by
anticipation
the
pleasure
she
should
have
in
launching
some
terrible
epigram
against
vandenesse
heavens
i
have
just
invited
him
to
my
house
cried
madame
d
espard
didn
t
i
receive
him
at
my
ball
replied
lady
dudley
some
pleasures
my
dear
love
are
the
news
of
the
mutual
attachment
between
raoul
and
madame
de
vandenesse
circulated
in
the
world
after
this
but
not
without
exciting
denials
and
incredulity
the
countess
however
was
defended
by
her
friends
lady
dudley
and
mesdames
d
espard
and
de
manerville
with
an
unnecessary
warmth
that
gave
a
certain
color
to
the
calumny
on
the
following
wednesday
evening
raoul
went
to
madame
d
espard
s
and
was
able
to
exchange
a
few
sentences
with
marie
more
expressive
by
their
tones
than
their
ideas
in
the
midst
of
the
elegant
assembly
both
found
pleasure
in
those
enjoyable
sensations
given
by
the
voice
the
gestures
the
attitude
of
one
beloved
the
soul
then
fastens
upon
absolute
nothings
no
longer
do
ideas
or
even
language
speak
but
things
and
these
so
loudly
that
often
a
man
lets
another
pay
the
small
attentions
bring
a
cup
of
tea
or
the
sugar
to
sweeten
it
demanded
by
the
woman
he
loves
fearful
of
betraying
his
emotion
to
eyes
that
seem
to
see
nothing
and
yet
see
all
raoul
however
a
man
indifferent
to
the
eyes
of
the
world
betrayed
his
passion
in
his
speech
and
was
brilliantly
witty
the
company
listened
to
the
roar
of
a
discourse
inspired
by
the
restraint
put
upon
him
restraint
being
that
which
artists
can
not
endure
this
rolandic
fury
this
wit
which
slashed
down
all
things
using
epigram
as
its
weapon
intoxicated
marie
and
amused
the
circle
around
them
as
the
sight
of
a
bull
goaded
with
banderols
amuses
the
company
in
a
spanish
circus
you
may
kick
as
you
please
but
you
can
t
make
a
solitude
about
you
whispered
blondet
the
words
brought
raoul
to
his
senses
and
he
ceased
to
exhibit
his
irritation
to
the
company
madame
d
espard
came
up
to
offer
him
a
cup
of
tea
and
said
loud
enough
for
madame
de
vandenesse
to
hear
you
are
certainly
very
amusing
come
and
see
me
sometimes
at
four
o
the
word
amusing
offended
raoul
though
it
was
used
as
the
ground
of
an
invitation
blondet
took
pity
on
him
my
dear
fellow
he
said
taking
him
aside
into
a
corner
you
are
behaving
in
society
as
if
you
were
at
florine
s
here
no
one
shows
annoyance
or
spouts
long
articles
they
say
a
few
words
now
and
then
they
look
their
calmest
when
most
desirous
of
flinging
others
out
of
the
window
they
sneer
softly
they
pretend
not
to
think
of
the
woman
they
adore
and
they
are
careful
not
to
roll
like
a
donkey
on
the
in
society
my
good
raoul
conventions
rule
love
either
carry
off
madame
de
vandenesse
or
show
yourself
a
gentleman
as
it
is
you
are
playing
the
lover
in
one
of
your
own
nathan
listened
with
his
head
lowered
he
was
like
a
lion
caught
in
a
toil
i
ll
never
set
foot
in
this
house
again
he
cried
that
marquise
sells
her
tea
too
dear
she
thinks
me
amusing
i
understand
now
why
wanted
to
guillotine
this
whole
class
of
you
ll
be
back
here
blondet
was
right
passions
are
as
mean
as
they
are
cruel
the
next
day
after
long
hesitation
between
i
ll
go
i
ll
not
go
raoul
left
his
new
partners
in
the
midst
of
an
important
discussion
and
rushed
to
madame
d
espard
s
house
in
the
faubourg
beholding
rastignac
s
elegant
cabriolet
enter
the
while
he
was
paying
his
cab
at
the
gate
nathan
s
vanity
was
stung
he
resolved
to
have
a
cabriolet
himself
and
its
accompanying
tiger
too
the
carriage
of
the
countess
was
in
the
and
the
sight
of
it
swelled
raoul
s
heart
with
joy
marie
was
advancing
under
the
pressure
of
her
desires
with
the
regularity
of
the
hands
of
a
clock
obeying
the
mainspring
he
found
her
sitting
at
the
corner
of
the
fireplace
in
the
little
salon
instead
of
looking
at
nathan
when
he
was
announced
she
looked
at
his
reflection
in
a
mirror
monsieur
le
ministre
said
madame
d
espard
addressing
nathan
and
presenting
him
to
de
marsay
by
a
glance
was
maintaining
when
you
came
in
that
the
royalists
and
the
republicans
have
a
secret
understanding
you
ought
to
know
something
about
it
is
it
so
if
it
were
so
said
raoul
where
s
the
harm
we
hate
the
same
thing
we
agree
as
to
our
hatreds
we
differ
only
in
our
love
that
s
the
whole
of
the
alliance
is
odd
enough
said
de
marsay
giving
a
comprehensively
meaning
glance
at
the
comtesse
felix
and
nathan
it
won
t
last
said
rastignac
thinking
perhaps
wholly
of
politics
what
do
you
think
my
dear
asked
madame
d
espard
addressing
marie
i
know
nothing
of
public
affairs
replied
the
countess
but
you
soon
will
madame
said
de
marsay
and
then
you
will
be
doubly
our
so
saying
he
left
the
room
with
rastignac
and
madame
d
espard
accompanied
them
to
the
door
of
the
first
salon
the
lovers
had
the
room
to
themselves
for
a
few
moments
marie
held
out
her
ungloved
hand
to
raoul
who
took
and
kissed
it
as
though
he
were
eighteen
years
old
the
eyes
of
the
countess
expressed
so
noble
a
tenderness
that
the
tears
which
men
of
nervous
temperament
can
always
find
at
their
service
came
into
raoul
s
eyes
where
can
i
see
you
where
can
i
speak
with
you
he
said
it
is
death
to
be
forced
to
disguise
my
voice
my
look
my
heart
my
love
moved
by
that
tear
marie
promised
to
drive
daily
in
the
bois
unless
the
weather
were
extremely
bad
this
promise
gave
raoul
more
pleasure
than
he
had
found
in
florine
for
the
last
five
years
i
have
so
many
things
to
say
to
you
i
suffer
from
the
silence
to
which
we
are
condemned
the
countess
looked
at
him
eagerly
without
replying
and
at
that
moment
madame
d
espard
returned
to
the
room
why
didn
t
you
answer
de
marsay
she
said
as
she
entered
we
ought
to
respect
the
dead
replied
raoul
don
t
you
see
that
he
is
dying
rastignac
is
his
nurse
hoping
to
be
put
in
the
the
countess
pretended
to
have
other
visits
to
pay
and
left
the
house
for
this
quarter
of
an
hour
raoul
had
sacrificed
important
interests
and
most
precious
time
marie
was
perfectly
ignorant
of
the
life
of
such
men
involved
in
complicated
affairs
and
burdened
with
exacting
toil
women
of
society
are
still
under
the
influence
of
the
traditions
of
the
eighteenth
century
in
which
all
positions
were
definite
and
assured
few
women
know
the
harassments
in
the
life
of
most
men
who
in
these
days
have
a
position
to
make
and
to
maintain
a
fame
to
reach
a
fortune
to
consolidate
men
of
settled
wealth
and
position
can
now
be
counted
old
men
alone
have
time
to
love
young
men
are
rowing
like
nathan
the
galleys
of
ambition
women
are
not
yet
resigned
to
this
change
of
customs
they
suppose
the
same
leisure
of
which
they
have
too
much
in
those
who
have
none
they
can
not
imagine
other
occupations
other
ends
in
life
than
their
own
when
a
lover
has
vanquished
the
lernean
hydra
in
order
to
pay
them
a
visit
he
has
no
merit
in
their
eyes
they
are
only
grateful
to
him
for
the
pleasure
he
gives
they
neither
know
nor
care
what
it
costs
raoul
became
aware
as
he
returned
from
this
visit
how
difficult
it
would
be
to
hold
the
reins
of
a
in
society
the
chariot
of
journalism
his
dramas
on
the
stage
and
his
generally
involved
affairs
the
paper
will
be
wretched
he
thought
as
he
walked
away
no
article
of
mine
and
only
the
second
number
too
madame
felix
de
vandenesse
drove
three
times
to
the
bois
de
boulogne
without
finding
raoul
the
third
time
she
came
back
anxious
and
uneasy
the
fact
was
that
nathan
did
not
choose
to
show
himself
in
the
bois
until
he
could
go
there
as
a
prince
of
the
press
he
employed
a
whole
week
in
searching
for
horses
a
phantom
and
a
suitable
tiger
and
in
convincing
his
partners
of
the
necessity
of
saving
time
so
precious
to
them
and
therefore
of
charging
his
equipage
to
the
costs
of
the
journal
his
associates
massol
and
du
tillet
agreed
to
this
so
readily
that
he
really
believed
them
the
best
fellows
in
the
world
without
this
help
however
life
would
have
been
simply
impossible
to
raoul
as
it
was
it
became
so
irksome
that
many
men
even
those
of
the
strongest
constitutions
could
not
have
borne
it
a
violent
and
successful
passion
takes
a
great
deal
of
space
in
an
ordinary
life
but
when
it
is
connected
with
a
woman
in
the
social
position
of
madame
de
vandenesse
it
sucks
the
life
out
of
a
man
as
busy
as
raoul
here
is
a
list
of
the
obligations
his
passion
imposed
upon
him
every
day
or
nearly
every
day
he
was
obliged
to
be
on
horseback
in
the
bois
between
two
and
three
o
clock
in
the
careful
dress
of
a
gentleman
of
leisure
he
had
to
learn
at
what
house
or
theatre
he
could
meet
madame
de
vandenesse
in
the
evening
he
was
not
able
to
leave
the
party
or
the
play
until
long
after
midnight
having
obtained
nothing
better
than
a
few
tender
sentences
long
awaited
said
in
a
doorway
or
hastily
as
he
put
her
into
her
carriage
it
frequently
happened
that
marie
who
by
this
time
had
launched
him
into
the
great
world
procured
for
him
invitations
to
dinner
in
certain
houses
where
she
went
herself
all
this
seemed
the
simplest
life
in
the
world
to
her
raoul
moved
by
pride
and
led
on
by
his
passion
never
told
her
of
his
labors
he
obeyed
the
will
of
this
innocent
sovereign
followed
in
her
train
followed
also
the
parliamentary
debates
edited
and
wrote
for
his
newspaper
and
put
upon
the
stage
two
plays
the
money
for
which
was
absolutely
indispensable
to
him
it
sufficed
for
madame
de
vandenesse
to
make
a
little
face
of
displeasure
when
he
tried
to
excuse
himself
from
attending
a
ball
a
concert
or
from
driving
in
the
bois
to
compel
him
to
sacrifice
his
most
pressing
interests
to
her
good
pleasure
when
he
left
society
between
one
and
two
in
the
morning
he
went
straight
to
work
until
eight
or
nine
he
was
scarcely
asleep
before
he
was
obliged
to
be
up
and
concocting
the
opinions
of
his
journal
with
the
men
of
political
influence
on
whom
he
depended
not
to
speak
of
the
thousand
and
one
other
details
of
the
paper
journalism
is
connected
with
everything
in
these
days
with
industrial
concerns
with
public
and
private
interests
with
all
new
enterprises
and
all
the
schemes
of
literature
its
and
its
products
when
nathan
harassed
and
fatigued
would
rush
from
his
editorial
office
to
the
theatre
from
the
theatre
to
the
chamber
from
the
chamber
to
face
certain
creditors
he
was
forced
to
appear
in
the
bois
with
a
calm
countenance
and
gallop
beside
marie
s
carriage
in
the
leisurely
style
of
a
man
devoid
of
cares
and
with
no
other
duties
than
those
of
love
when
in
return
for
this
toilsome
and
wholly
ignored
devotion
all
he
won
were
a
few
sweet
words
the
prettiest
assurances
of
eternal
attachment
ardent
pressures
of
the
hand
on
the
very
few
occasions
when
they
found
themselves
alone
he
began
to
feel
he
was
rather
duped
by
leaving
his
mistress
in
ignorance
of
the
enormous
costs
of
these
little
attentions
as
our
fathers
called
them
the
occasion
for
an
explanation
arrived
in
due
time
on
a
fine
april
morning
the
countess
accepted
nathan
s
arm
for
a
walk
through
the
sequestered
path
of
the
bois
de
boulogne
she
intended
to
make
him
one
of
those
pretty
little
quarrels
apropos
of
nothing
which
women
are
so
fond
of
exciting
instead
of
greeting
him
as
usual
with
a
smile
upon
her
lips
her
forehead
illumined
with
pleasure
her
eyes
bright
with
some
gay
or
delicate
thought
she
assumed
a
grave
and
serious
aspect
what
is
the
matter
said
nathan
why
do
you
pretend
to
such
ignorance
she
replied
you
ought
to
know
that
a
woman
is
not
a
have
i
displeased
you
should
i
be
here
if
you
had
but
you
don
t
smile
to
me
you
don
t
seem
happy
to
see
oh
do
you
accuse
me
of
sulking
she
said
looking
at
him
with
that
submissive
air
which
women
assume
when
they
want
to
seem
victims
nathan
walked
on
a
few
steps
in
a
state
of
real
apprehension
which
oppressed
him
it
must
be
he
said
after
a
moment
s
silence
one
of
those
frivolous
fears
those
hazy
suspicions
which
women
dwell
on
more
than
they
do
on
the
great
things
of
life
you
all
have
a
way
of
tipping
the
world
sideways
with
a
straw
a
cobweb
sarcasm
she
said
i
might
have
expected
it
marie
my
angel
i
only
said
those
words
to
wring
your
secret
out
of
my
secret
would
be
always
a
secret
even
if
i
told
it
to
but
all
the
same
tell
it
to
i
am
not
loved
she
said
giving
him
one
of
those
sly
oblique
glances
with
which
women
question
so
maliciously
the
men
they
are
trying
to
torment
not
loved
cried
nathan
no
you
are
too
occupied
with
other
things
what
am
i
to
you
in
the
midst
of
them
forgotten
on
the
least
occasion
yesterday
i
came
to
the
bois
and
you
were
not
here
but
i
had
put
on
a
new
dress
expressly
to
please
you
you
did
not
come
where
were
you
but
i
did
not
know
where
i
went
to
madame
d
espard
s
you
were
not
but
that
evening
at
the
opera
i
watched
the
balcony
every
time
a
door
opened
my
heart
was
beating
but
what
an
evening
i
had
you
don
t
reflect
on
such
tempests
of
the
but
life
is
shortened
by
such
but
well
what
she
said
you
are
right
life
is
shortened
by
them
said
nathan
and
in
a
few
months
you
will
utterly
have
consumed
mine
your
unreasonable
reproaches
drag
my
secret
from
me
ha
you
say
you
are
not
loved
you
are
loved
too
and
thereupon
he
vividly
depicted
his
position
told
of
his
sleepless
nights
his
duties
at
certain
hours
the
absolute
necessity
of
succeeding
in
his
enterprise
the
insatiable
requirements
of
a
newspaper
in
which
he
was
required
to
judge
the
events
of
the
whole
world
without
blundering
under
pain
of
losing
his
power
and
so
losing
all
the
infinite
amount
of
rapid
study
he
was
forced
to
give
to
questions
which
passed
as
rapidly
as
clouds
in
this
age
etc
raoul
made
a
great
mistake
the
marquise
d
espard
had
said
to
him
on
one
occasion
nothing
is
more
naive
than
a
first
as
he
unfolded
before
marie
s
eyes
this
life
which
seemed
to
her
immense
the
countess
was
overcome
with
admiration
she
had
thought
nathan
grand
she
now
considered
him
sublime
she
blamed
herself
for
loving
him
too
much
begged
him
to
come
to
her
only
when
he
could
do
so
without
difficulty
wait
indeed
she
could
wait
in
future
she
should
know
how
to
sacrifice
her
enjoyments
wishing
to
be
his
was
she
really
an
obstacle
she
wept
with
despair
women
she
said
with
tears
in
her
eyes
can
only
love
men
act
they
have
a
thousand
ways
in
which
they
are
bound
to
act
but
we
can
only
think
and
pray
and
a
love
that
had
sacrificed
so
much
for
her
sake
deserved
a
recompense
she
looked
about
her
like
a
nightingale
descending
from
a
leafy
covert
to
drink
at
a
spring
to
see
if
she
were
alone
in
the
solitude
if
the
silence
hid
no
witness
then
she
raised
her
head
to
raoul
who
bent
his
own
and
let
him
take
one
kiss
the
first
and
the
only
one
that
she
ever
gave
in
secret
feeling
happier
at
that
moment
than
she
had
felt
in
five
years
raoul
thought
all
his
toils
they
both
walked
forward
they
scarcely
knew
where
but
it
was
on
the
road
to
auteuil
presently
however
they
were
forced
to
return
and
find
their
carriages
pacing
together
with
the
rhythmic
step
to
lovers
raoul
had
faith
in
that
kiss
given
with
the
quiet
facility
of
a
sacred
sentiment
all
the
evil
of
it
was
in
the
mind
of
the
world
not
in
that
of
the
woman
who
walked
beside
him
marie
herself
given
over
to
the
grateful
admiration
which
characterizes
the
love
of
woman
walked
with
a
firm
light
step
on
the
gravelled
path
saying
like
raoul
but
few
words
yet
those
few
were
felt
and
full
of
meaning
the
sky
was
cloudless
the
tall
trees
had
burgeoned
a
few
green
shoots
were
already
brightening
their
myriad
of
brown
twigs
the
shrubs
the
birches
the
willows
the
poplars
were
showing
their
first
diaphanous
and
tender
foliage
no
soul
resists
these
harmonies
love
explained
nature
as
it
had
already
explained
society
to
marie
s
heart
i
wish
you
have
never
loved
any
one
but
me
she
said
your
wish
is
realized
replied
raoul
we
have
awakened
in
each
other
the
only
true
he
spoke
the
truth
as
he
felt
it
posing
before
this
innocent
young
heart
as
a
pure
man
raoul
was
caught
himself
by
his
own
fine
sentiments
at
first
purely
speculative
and
born
of
vanity
his
love
had
now
become
sincere
he
began
by
lying
he
had
ended
in
speaking
truth
in
all
writers
there
is
ever
a
sentiment
difficult
to
stifle
which
impels
them
to
admire
the
highest
good
the
countess
on
her
part
after
her
first
rush
of
gratitude
and
surprise
was
charmed
to
have
inspired
such
sacrifices
to
have
caused
him
to
surmount
such
difficulties
she
was
beloved
by
a
man
who
was
worthy
of
her
raoul
was
totally
ignorant
to
what
his
imaginary
grandeur
bound
him
women
will
not
suffer
their
idol
to
step
down
from
his
pedestal
they
do
not
forgive
the
slightest
pettiness
in
a
god
marie
was
far
from
knowing
the
solution
to
the
riddle
given
by
raoul
to
his
friends
at
very
s
the
struggle
of
this
writer
risen
from
the
lower
classes
had
cost
him
the
ten
first
years
of
his
youth
and
now
in
the
days
of
his
success
he
longed
to
be
loved
by
one
of
the
queens
of
the
great
world
vanity
without
which
as
champfort
says
love
would
be
but
a
feeble
thing
sustained
his
passion
and
increased
it
day
by
day
can
you
swear
to
me
said
marie
that
you
belong
and
will
never
belong
to
any
other
woman
there
is
neither
time
in
my
life
nor
place
in
my
heart
for
any
other
woman
replied
raoul
not
thinking
that
he
told
a
lie
so
little
did
he
value
florine
i
believe
you
she
said
when
they
reached
the
alley
where
their
carriages
were
waiting
marie
dropped
raoul
s
arm
and
the
young
man
assumed
a
respectful
and
distant
attitude
as
if
he
had
just
met
her
he
accompanied
her
with
his
hat
off
to
her
carriage
then
he
followed
her
by
the
avenue
charles
breathing
in
with
satisfaction
the
very
dust
her
caleche
raised
in
spite
of
marie
s
high
renunciations
raoul
continued
to
follow
her
everywhere
he
adored
the
air
of
mingled
pleasure
and
displeasure
with
which
she
scolded
him
for
wasting
his
precious
time
she
took
direction
of
his
labors
she
gave
him
formal
orders
on
the
employment
of
his
time
she
stayed
at
home
to
deprive
him
of
every
pretext
for
dissipation
every
morning
she
read
his
paper
and
became
the
herald
of
his
staff
of
editors
of
etienne
lousteau
the
feuilletonist
whom
she
thought
delightful
of
felicien
vernou
of
claude
vignon
in
short
of
the
whole
staff
she
advised
raoul
to
do
justice
to
de
marsay
when
he
died
and
she
read
with
deep
emotion
the
noble
eulogy
which
raoul
published
upon
the
dead
minister
while
blaming
his
machiavelianism
and
his
hatred
for
the
masses
she
was
present
of
course
at
the
gymnase
on
the
occasion
of
the
first
representation
of
the
play
upon
the
proceeds
of
which
nathan
relied
to
support
his
enterprise
and
was
completely
duped
by
the
purchased
applause
you
did
not
bid
farewell
to
the
italian
opera
said
lady
dudley
to
whose
house
she
went
after
the
performance
no
i
went
to
the
gymnase
they
gave
a
first
i
can
t
endure
vaudevilles
i
am
like
louis
xiv
about
teniers
said
lady
dudley
for
my
part
said
madame
d
espard
i
think
actors
have
greatly
improved
vaudevilles
in
the
present
day
are
really
charming
comedies
full
of
wit
requiring
great
talent
they
amuse
me
very
the
actors
are
excellent
too
said
marie
those
at
the
gymnase
played
very
well
the
piece
pleased
them
the
dialogue
was
witty
and
like
those
of
beaumarchais
said
lady
dudley
monsieur
nathan
is
not
moliere
as
yet
but
said
madame
d
espard
looking
at
the
countess
he
makes
vaudevilles
said
madame
charles
de
vandenesse
and
unmakes
ministries
added
madame
de
manerville
the
countess
was
silent
she
wanted
to
answer
with
a
sharp
repartee
her
heart
was
bounding
with
anger
but
she
could
find
nothing
better
to
say
than
he
will
make
them
all
the
women
looked
at
each
other
with
mysterious
significance
when
marie
de
vandenesse
departed
moina
de
exclaimed
she
adores
and
she
makes
no
secret
of
it
said
madame
d
espard
chapter
vii
suicide
in
the
month
of
may
vandenesse
took
his
wife
as
usual
to
their
where
she
was
consoled
by
the
passionate
letters
she
received
from
raoul
to
whom
she
wrote
every
day
marie
s
absence
might
have
saved
raoul
from
the
gulf
into
which
he
was
falling
if
florine
had
been
near
him
but
unfortunately
he
was
alone
in
the
midst
of
friends
who
had
become
his
enemies
from
the
moment
that
he
showed
his
intention
of
ruling
them
his
staff
of
writers
hated
him
pro
ready
to
hold
out
a
hand
to
him
and
console
him
in
case
of
a
fall
ready
to
adore
him
in
case
of
success
so
goes
the
world
of
literature
no
one
is
really
liked
but
an
inferior
every
man
s
hand
is
against
him
who
is
likely
to
rise
this
envy
doubles
the
chances
of
common
minds
who
excite
neither
envy
nor
suspicion
who
make
their
way
like
moles
and
fools
though
they
be
find
themselves
gazetted
in
the
moniteur
for
three
or
four
places
while
men
of
talent
are
still
struggling
at
the
door
to
keep
each
other
out
the
underhand
enmity
of
these
pretended
friends
which
florine
would
have
scented
with
the
innate
faculty
of
a
courtesan
to
get
at
truth
amid
a
thousand
misleading
circumstances
was
by
no
means
raoul
s
greatest
danger
his
partners
massol
the
lawyer
and
du
tillet
the
banker
had
intended
from
the
first
to
harness
his
ardor
to
the
chariot
of
their
own
importance
and
get
rid
of
him
as
soon
as
he
was
out
of
condition
to
feed
the
paper
or
else
to
deprive
him
of
his
power
arbitrarily
whenever
it
suited
their
purpose
to
take
it
to
them
nathan
represented
a
certain
amount
of
talent
to
use
up
a
literary
force
of
the
motive
power
of
ten
pens
to
employ
massol
one
of
those
lawyers
who
mistake
the
faculty
of
endless
speech
for
eloquence
who
possess
the
art
of
boring
by
diffusiveness
the
torment
of
all
meetings
and
assemblies
where
they
belittle
everything
and
who
desire
to
become
personages
at
any
cost
massol
no
longer
wanted
the
place
as
keeper
of
the
seals
he
had
seen
some
five
or
six
different
men
go
through
that
office
in
four
years
and
the
robes
disgusted
him
in
exchange
his
mind
was
now
set
on
obtaining
a
chair
on
the
board
of
education
and
a
place
in
the
council
of
state
the
whole
adorned
with
the
cross
of
the
legion
of
honor
du
tillet
and
nucingen
had
guaranteed
the
cross
to
him
and
the
office
of
master
of
petitions
provided
he
obeyed
them
blindly
the
better
to
deceive
raoul
these
men
allowed
him
to
manage
the
paper
without
control
du
tillet
used
it
only
for
his
about
which
nathan
understood
next
to
nothing
but
he
had
given
through
nucingen
an
assurance
to
rastignac
that
the
paper
would
be
tacitly
obliging
to
the
government
on
the
sole
condition
of
supporting
his
candidacy
for
monsieur
de
nucingen
s
place
as
soon
as
he
was
nominated
peer
of
france
raoul
was
thus
being
undermined
by
the
banker
and
the
lawyer
who
saw
him
with
much
satisfaction
lording
it
in
the
newspaper
profiting
by
all
advantages
and
harvesting
the
fruits
of
while
nathan
enchanted
believed
them
to
be
as
on
the
occasion
of
his
equestrian
wants
the
best
fellows
in
the
world
he
thought
he
managed
them
men
of
imagination
to
whom
hope
is
the
basis
of
existence
never
allow
themselves
to
know
that
the
most
perilous
moment
in
their
affairs
is
that
when
all
seems
going
well
according
to
their
wishes
this
was
a
period
of
triumph
by
which
nathan
profited
he
appeared
as
a
personage
in
the
world
political
and
financial
du
tillet
presented
him
to
the
nucingens
madame
de
nucingen
received
him
cordially
less
for
himself
than
for
madame
de
vandenesse
but
when
she
ventured
a
few
words
about
the
countess
he
thought
himself
marvellously
clever
in
using
florine
as
a
shield
he
alluded
to
his
relations
with
the
actress
in
a
tone
of
generous
how
could
he
desert
a
great
devotion
for
the
coquetries
of
the
faubourg
nathan
manipulated
by
nucingen
and
rastignac
by
du
tillet
and
blondet
gave
his
support
ostentatiously
to
the
doctrinaires
of
their
new
and
ephemeral
cabinet
but
in
order
to
show
himself
pure
of
all
bribery
he
refused
to
take
advantage
of
certain
profitable
enterprises
which
were
started
by
means
of
his
paper
he
who
had
no
reluctance
in
compromising
friends
or
in
behaving
with
little
decency
to
mechanics
under
certain
circumstances
such
meannesses
the
result
of
vanity
and
of
ambition
are
found
in
many
lives
like
his
the
mantle
must
be
splendid
before
the
eyes
of
the
world
and
we
steal
our
friend
s
or
a
poor
man
s
cloth
to
patch
it
nevertheless
two
months
after
the
departure
of
the
countess
raoul
had
a
certain
rabelaisian
quart
d
heure
which
caused
him
some
anxiety
in
the
midst
of
these
triumphs
du
tillet
had
advanced
a
hundred
thousand
francs
florine
s
money
had
gone
in
the
costs
of
the
first
establishment
of
the
paper
which
were
enormous
it
was
necessary
to
provide
for
the
future
the
banker
agreed
to
let
the
editor
have
fifty
thousand
francs
on
notes
for
four
months
du
tillet
thus
held
raoul
by
the
halter
of
an
iou
by
means
of
this
relief
the
funds
of
the
paper
were
secured
for
six
months
in
the
eyes
of
some
writers
six
months
is
an
eternity
besides
by
dint
of
advertising
and
by
offering
illusory
advantages
to
subscribers
two
thousand
had
been
secured
an
influx
of
travellers
added
to
this
which
was
enough
perhaps
to
excuse
the
throwing
of
more
after
the
rest
a
little
more
display
of
talent
a
timely
political
trial
or
crisis
an
apparent
persecution
and
raoul
felt
certain
of
becoming
one
of
those
modern
condottieri
whose
ink
is
worth
more
than
powder
and
shot
of
the
olden
time
this
loan
from
du
tillet
was
already
made
when
florine
returned
with
fifty
thousand
francs
instead
of
creating
a
savings
fund
with
that
sum
raoul
certain
of
success
simply
because
he
felt
it
was
necessary
and
already
humiliated
at
having
accepted
the
actress
s
money
deceived
florine
as
to
his
actual
position
and
persuaded
her
to
employ
the
money
in
refurnishing
her
house
the
actress
who
did
not
need
persuasion
not
only
spent
the
sum
in
hand
but
she
burdened
herself
with
a
debt
of
thirty
thousand
francs
with
which
she
obtained
a
charming
little
house
all
to
herself
in
the
rue
pigale
whither
her
old
society
resorted
raoul
had
reserved
the
production
of
his
great
piece
in
which
was
a
part
especially
suited
to
florine
until
her
return
this
was
to
be
raoul
s
farewell
to
the
stage
the
newspapers
with
that
good
nature
which
costs
nothing
prepared
the
way
for
such
an
ovation
to
florine
that
even
the
talked
of
engaging
her
the
feuilletons
proclaimed
her
the
heiress
of
mars
this
triumph
was
sufficiently
dazzling
to
prevent
florine
from
carefully
studying
the
ground
on
which
nathan
was
advancing
she
lived
for
the
time
being
in
a
round
of
festivities
and
glory
according
to
those
about
her
he
was
now
a
great
political
character
he
was
justified
in
his
enterprise
he
would
certainly
be
a
deputy
probably
a
minister
in
course
of
time
like
so
many
others
as
for
nathan
himself
he
firmly
believed
that
in
the
next
session
of
the
chamber
he
should
find
himself
in
government
with
two
other
journalists
one
of
whom
already
a
minister
was
anxious
to
associate
some
of
his
own
craft
with
himself
and
so
consolidate
his
power
after
a
separation
of
six
months
nathan
met
florine
again
with
pleasure
and
returned
easily
to
his
old
way
of
life
all
his
comforts
came
from
the
actress
but
he
embroidered
the
heavy
tissue
of
his
life
with
the
flowers
of
ideal
passion
his
letters
to
marie
were
masterpieces
of
grace
and
style
nathan
made
her
the
light
of
his
life
he
undertook
nothing
without
consulting
his
guardian
in
despair
at
being
on
the
popular
side
he
talked
of
going
over
to
that
of
the
aristocracy
but
in
spite
of
his
habitual
agility
even
he
saw
the
absolute
impossibility
of
such
a
jump
it
was
easier
to
become
a
minister
marie
s
precious
replies
were
deposited
in
one
of
those
portfolios
with
patent
locks
made
by
huret
or
fichet
two
mechanics
who
were
then
waging
war
in
advertisements
and
posters
all
over
paris
as
to
which
could
make
the
safest
and
most
impenetrable
locks
this
portfolio
was
left
about
in
florine
s
new
boudoir
where
nathan
did
much
of
his
work
no
one
is
easier
to
deceive
than
a
woman
to
whom
a
man
is
in
the
habit
of
telling
everything
she
has
no
suspicions
she
thinks
she
sees
and
hears
and
knows
all
besides
since
her
return
nathan
had
led
the
most
regular
of
lives
under
her
very
nose
never
did
she
imagine
that
that
portfolio
which
she
hardly
glanced
at
as
it
lay
there
unconcealed
contained
the
letters
of
a
rival
treasures
of
admiring
love
which
the
countess
addressed
at
raoul
s
request
to
the
office
of
his
newspaper
nathan
s
situation
was
therefore
to
all
appearance
extremely
brilliant
he
had
many
friends
the
two
plays
lately
produced
had
succeeded
well
and
their
proceeds
supplied
his
personal
wants
and
relieved
him
of
all
care
for
the
future
his
debt
to
du
tillet
his
friend
did
not
make
him
in
the
least
uneasy
why
distrust
a
friend
he
said
to
blondet
who
from
time
to
time
would
cast
a
doubt
on
his
position
led
to
do
so
by
his
general
habit
of
analyzing
but
we
don
t
need
to
distrust
our
enemies
remarked
florine
nathan
defended
du
tillet
he
was
the
best
the
most
upright
of
men
this
existence
which
was
really
that
of
a
dancer
on
the
tight
rope
without
his
would
have
alarmed
any
one
even
the
most
indifferent
had
it
been
seen
as
it
really
was
du
tillet
watched
it
with
the
cool
eye
and
the
cynicism
of
a
parvenu
through
the
friendly
good
humor
of
his
intercourse
with
raoul
there
flashed
now
and
then
a
malignant
jeer
one
day
after
pressing
his
hand
in
florine
s
boudoir
and
watching
him
as
he
got
into
his
carriage
du
tillet
remarked
to
lousteau
envier
par
excellence
that
fellow
is
off
to
the
bois
in
fine
style
but
he
is
just
as
likely
six
months
hence
to
be
in
a
debtor
s
he
never
cried
lousteau
he
has
how
do
you
know
that
he
ll
keep
her
as
for
you
who
are
worth
a
dozen
of
him
i
predict
that
you
will
be
our
within
six
in
october
nathan
s
notes
to
du
tillet
fell
due
and
the
banker
graciously
renewed
them
but
for
two
months
only
with
the
discount
added
and
a
fresh
loan
sure
of
victory
raoul
was
not
afraid
of
continuing
to
put
his
hand
in
the
bag
madame
felix
de
vandenesse
was
to
return
in
a
few
days
a
month
earlier
than
usual
brought
back
of
course
by
her
unconquerable
desire
to
see
nathan
who
felt
that
he
could
not
be
short
of
money
at
a
time
when
he
renewed
that
assiduous
life
correspondence
in
which
the
pen
is
always
bolder
than
speech
and
thought
wreathing
itself
with
flowers
allows
itself
to
be
seen
without
disguise
and
brought
the
countess
to
the
highest
pitch
of
enthusiasm
she
believed
she
saw
in
raoul
one
of
the
noblest
spirits
of
the
epoch
a
delicate
but
misjudged
heart
without
a
stain
and
worthy
of
adoration
she
saw
him
advancing
with
a
brave
hand
to
grasp
the
sceptre
of
power
soon
that
speech
so
beautiful
in
love
would
echo
from
the
tribune
marie
now
lived
only
in
this
life
of
a
world
outside
her
own
her
taste
was
lost
for
the
tranquil
joys
of
home
and
she
gave
herself
up
to
the
agitations
of
this
whirlwind
life
communicated
by
a
clever
and
adoring
pen
she
kissed
raoul
s
letters
written
in
the
midst
of
the
ceaseless
battles
of
the
press
with
time
taken
from
necessary
studies
she
felt
their
value
she
was
certain
of
being
loved
and
loved
only
with
no
rival
but
the
fame
and
ambition
he
adored
she
found
enough
in
her
country
solitude
to
fill
her
soul
and
employ
her
faculties
happy
indeed
to
have
been
so
chosen
by
such
a
man
who
to
her
was
an
angel
during
the
last
days
of
autumn
marie
and
raoul
again
met
and
renewed
their
walks
in
the
bois
where
alone
they
could
see
each
other
until
the
salons
reopened
but
when
the
winter
fairly
began
raoul
appeared
in
social
life
at
his
apogee
he
was
almost
a
personage
rastignac
now
out
of
power
with
the
ministry
which
went
to
pieces
on
the
death
of
de
marsay
leaned
upon
nathan
and
gave
him
in
return
the
warmest
praise
madame
de
vandenesse
feeling
this
change
in
public
opinion
was
desirous
of
knowing
if
her
husband
s
judgment
had
altered
also
she
questioned
him
again
perhaps
with
the
hope
of
obtaining
one
of
those
brilliant
revenges
which
please
all
women
even
the
noblest
and
least
worldly
for
may
we
not
believe
that
even
the
angels
retain
some
portion
of
their
as
they
gather
in
serried
ranks
before
the
holy
of
holies
nothing
was
wanting
to
raoul
nathan
but
to
be
the
dupe
he
now
is
to
a
parcel
of
intriguing
sharpers
replied
the
count
felix
whose
knowledge
of
the
world
and
politics
enabled
him
to
judge
clearly
had
seen
nathan
s
true
position
he
explained
to
his
wife
that
fieschi
s
attempt
had
resulted
in
attaching
to
the
interests
threatened
by
this
attack
on
a
large
body
of
hitherto
lukewarm
persons
the
newspapers
which
were
and
did
not
show
their
colors
would
lose
subscribers
for
journalism
like
politics
was
about
to
be
simplified
by
falling
into
regular
lines
if
nathan
had
put
his
whole
fortune
into
that
newspaper
he
would
lose
it
this
judgment
so
apparently
just
and
though
brief
and
given
by
a
man
who
fathomed
a
matter
in
which
he
had
no
interest
alarmed
madame
de
vandenesse
do
you
take
an
interest
in
him
asked
her
husband
only
as
a
man
whose
mind
interests
me
and
whose
conversation
i
this
reply
was
made
so
naturally
that
the
count
suspected
nothing
the
next
day
at
four
o
clock
marie
and
raoul
had
a
long
conversation
together
in
a
low
voice
in
madame
d
espard
s
salon
the
countess
expressed
fears
which
raoul
dissipated
only
too
happy
to
destroy
by
epigrams
the
conjugal
judgment
nathan
had
a
revenge
to
take
he
characterized
the
count
as
behind
the
age
a
man
who
judged
the
revolution
of
july
with
the
eyes
of
the
restoration
who
would
never
be
willing
to
admit
the
triumph
of
the
the
new
force
of
all
societies
whether
temporary
or
lasting
but
a
real
force
instead
of
turning
his
mind
to
the
study
of
an
opinion
given
impartially
and
incidentally
by
a
man
in
politics
raoul
mounted
his
stilts
and
stalked
about
in
the
purple
of
his
own
glory
where
is
the
woman
who
would
not
have
believed
his
glowing
talk
sooner
than
the
cold
logic
of
her
husband
madame
de
vandenesse
completely
reassured
returned
to
her
life
of
little
enjoyments
clandestine
pressures
of
the
hand
occasional
quarrels
in
short
to
her
nourishment
of
the
year
before
harmless
in
itself
but
likely
to
drag
a
woman
over
the
border
if
the
man
she
favors
is
resolute
and
impatient
of
obstacles
happily
for
her
nathan
was
not
dangerous
besides
he
was
too
full
of
his
immediate
to
think
at
this
time
of
profiting
by
his
love
but
toward
the
end
of
december
when
the
second
notes
fell
due
du
tillet
demanded
payment
the
rich
banker
who
said
he
was
embarrassed
advised
raoul
to
borrow
the
money
for
a
short
time
from
a
usurer
from
gigonnet
the
providence
of
all
young
men
who
were
pressed
for
money
in
january
he
remarked
the
renewal
of
subscriptions
to
the
paper
would
be
coming
in
there
would
be
plenty
of
money
in
hand
and
they
could
then
see
what
had
best
be
done
besides
couldn
t
nathan
write
a
play
as
a
matter
of
pride
raoul
determined
to
pay
off
the
notes
at
once
du
tillet
gave
raoul
a
letter
to
gigonnet
who
counted
out
the
money
on
a
note
of
nathan
s
at
twenty
days
sight
instead
of
asking
himself
the
reason
of
such
unusual
facility
raoul
felt
vexed
at
his
folly
in
not
having
asked
for
more
that
is
how
men
who
are
truly
remarkable
for
the
power
of
thought
are
apt
to
behave
in
practical
business
they
seem
to
reserve
the
power
of
their
mind
for
their
writings
and
are
fearful
of
lessening
it
by
putting
it
to
use
in
the
daily
affairs
of
life
raoul
related
his
morning
to
florine
and
blondet
he
gave
them
an
inimitable
sketch
of
gigonnet
his
fireplace
without
fire
his
shabby
his
stairway
his
asthmatic
bell
his
aged
straw
mattress
his
den
without
warmth
like
his
eye
he
made
them
laugh
about
this
new
uncle
they
neither
troubled
themselves
about
du
tillet
and
his
pretended
want
of
money
nor
about
an
old
usurer
so
ready
to
disburse
what
was
there
to
worry
about
in
that
he
has
only
asked
you
fifteen
per
cent
said
blondet
you
ought
to
be
grateful
to
him
at
per
cent
you
don
t
bow
to
those
old
fellows
this
is
usury
doesn
t
begin
till
fifty
per
cent
and
then
you
despise
the
despise
him
cried
florine
if
any
of
your
friends
lent
you
money
at
that
price
they
d
pose
as
your
she
is
right
and
i
am
glad
i
don
t
owe
anything
now
to
du
tillet
said
raoul
why
this
lack
of
penetration
as
to
their
personal
affairs
in
men
whose
business
it
is
to
penetrate
all
things
perhaps
the
mind
can
not
be
complete
at
all
points
perhaps
artists
of
every
kind
live
too
much
in
the
present
moment
to
study
the
future
perhaps
they
are
too
observant
of
the
ridiculous
to
notice
snares
or
they
may
believe
that
none
would
dare
to
lay
a
snare
for
such
as
they
however
this
may
be
the
future
arrived
in
due
time
twenty
days
later
raoul
s
notes
were
protested
but
florine
obtained
from
the
court
of
commerce
an
extension
of
days
in
which
to
meet
them
thus
pressed
raoul
looked
into
his
affairs
and
asked
for
the
accounts
and
it
then
appeared
that
the
receipts
of
the
newspaper
covered
only
of
the
expenses
while
the
subscriptions
were
rapidly
dwindling
the
great
man
now
grew
anxious
and
gloomy
but
to
florine
only
in
whom
he
confided
she
advised
him
to
borrow
money
on
unwritten
plays
and
write
them
at
once
giving
a
lien
on
his
work
nathan
followed
this
advice
and
obtained
thereby
twenty
thousand
francs
which
reduced
his
debt
to
forty
thousand
on
the
of
february
the
days
expired
du
tillet
who
did
not
want
nathan
as
a
rival
before
the
electoral
college
where
he
meant
to
appear
himself
instigated
gigonnet
to
sue
nathan
without
compromise
a
man
locked
up
for
debt
could
not
present
himself
as
a
candidate
for
election
florine
was
herself
in
communication
with
the
sheriff
on
the
subject
of
her
personal
debts
and
no
resource
was
left
to
her
but
the
i
of
medea
for
her
new
furniture
and
belongings
were
now
attached
the
ambitious
raoul
heard
the
cracking
in
all
directions
of
his
prosperous
edifice
built
alas
without
foundations
his
nerve
failed
him
too
weak
already
to
sustain
so
vast
an
enterprise
he
felt
himself
incapable
of
attempting
to
build
it
up
again
he
was
fated
to
perish
in
its
ashes
love
for
the
countess
gave
him
still
a
few
thrills
of
life
his
mask
brightened
for
a
moment
but
behind
it
hope
was
dead
he
did
not
suspect
the
hand
of
du
tillet
and
laid
the
blame
of
his
misfortune
on
the
usurer
rastignac
blondet
lousteau
vernou
finot
and
massol
took
care
not
to
enlighten
him
rastignac
who
wanted
to
return
to
power
made
common
cause
with
nucingen
and
du
tillet
the
others
felt
a
satisfaction
in
the
catastrophe
of
an
equal
who
had
attempted
to
make
himself
their
master
none
of
them
however
would
have
said
a
word
to
florine
on
the
contrary
they
praised
raoul
to
her
nathan
they
said
has
the
shoulders
of
an
atlas
he
ll
pull
himself
through
all
will
come
there
were
two
new
subscribers
yesterday
said
blondet
gravely
raoul
will
certainly
be
elected
deputy
as
soon
as
the
budget
is
voted
the
dissolution
is
sure
to
take
but
nathan
sued
could
no
longer
obtain
even
usury
florine
with
all
her
personal
property
attached
could
count
on
nothing
but
inspiring
a
passion
in
some
fool
who
might
not
appear
at
the
right
moment
nathan
s
friends
were
all
men
without
money
and
without
credit
an
arrest
for
debt
would
destroy
his
hopes
of
a
political
career
and
besides
all
this
he
had
bound
himself
to
do
an
immense
amount
of
dramatic
work
for
which
he
had
already
received
payment
he
could
see
no
bottom
to
the
gulf
of
misery
that
lay
before
him
into
which
he
was
about
to
roll
in
presence
of
such
threatened
evil
his
boldness
deserted
him
would
the
comtesse
de
vandenesse
stand
by
him
would
she
fly
with
him
women
are
never
led
into
a
gulf
of
that
kind
except
by
an
absolute
love
and
the
love
of
raoul
and
marie
had
not
bound
them
together
by
the
mysterious
and
inalienable
ties
of
happiness
but
supposing
that
the
countess
did
follow
him
to
some
foreign
country
she
would
come
without
fortune
despoiled
of
everything
and
then
alas
she
would
merely
be
one
more
embarrassment
to
him
a
mind
of
a
second
order
and
a
proud
mind
like
that
of
nathan
would
be
likely
to
see
under
these
circumstances
and
did
see
in
suicide
the
sword
to
cut
the
gordian
knots
the
idea
of
failure
in
the
face
of
the
world
and
that
society
he
had
so
lately
entered
and
meant
to
rule
of
leaving
the
chariot
of
the
countess
and
becoming
once
more
a
muddied
pedestrian
was
more
than
he
could
bear
madness
began
to
dance
and
whirl
and
shake
her
bells
at
the
gates
of
the
fantastic
palace
in
which
the
poet
had
been
dreaming
in
this
extremity
nathan
waited
for
some
lucky
accident
determined
not
to
kill
himself
until
the
final
moment
during
the
last
days
employed
by
the
legal
formalities
required
before
proceeding
to
arrest
for
debt
raoul
went
about
in
spite
of
himself
with
that
coldly
sullen
and
morose
expression
of
face
which
may
be
noticed
in
persons
who
are
either
fated
to
commit
suicide
or
are
meditating
it
the
funereal
ideas
they
are
turning
over
in
their
minds
appear
upon
their
foreheads
in
gray
and
cloudy
tints
their
smile
has
something
fatalistic
in
it
their
motions
are
solemn
these
unhappy
beings
seem
to
want
to
suck
the
last
juices
of
the
life
they
mean
to
leave
their
eyes
see
things
invisible
their
ears
are
listening
to
a
they
pay
no
attention
to
the
minor
things
about
them
these
alarming
symptoms
marie
perceived
one
evening
at
lady
dudley
s
raoul
was
sitting
apart
on
a
sofa
in
the
boudoir
while
the
rest
of
the
company
were
conversing
in
the
salon
the
countess
went
to
the
door
but
he
did
not
raise
his
head
he
heard
neither
marie
s
breathing
nor
the
rustle
of
her
silk
dress
he
was
gazing
at
a
flower
in
the
carpet
with
fixed
eyes
stupid
with
grief
he
felt
he
had
rather
die
than
abdicate
all
the
world
can
t
have
the
rock
of
saint
helena
for
a
pedestal
moreover
suicide
was
then
the
fashion
in
paris
is
it
not
in
fact
the
last
resource
of
all
atheistical
societies
raoul
as
he
sat
there
had
decided
that
the
moment
had
come
to
die
despair
is
in
proportion
to
our
hopes
that
of
raoul
had
no
other
issue
than
the
grave
what
is
the
matter
cried
marie
flying
to
him
nothing
he
answered
there
is
one
way
of
saying
that
word
nothing
between
lovers
which
signifies
its
exact
contrary
marie
shrugged
her
shoulders
you
are
a
child
she
said
some
misfortune
has
happened
to
no
not
to
me
he
replied
but
you
will
know
all
soon
enough
marie
he
added
affectionately
what
were
you
thinking
of
when
i
came
in
she
asked
in
a
tone
of
authority
do
you
want
to
know
the
truth
she
nodded
i
was
thinking
of
you
i
was
saying
to
myself
that
most
men
in
my
place
would
have
wanted
to
be
loved
without
reserve
i
am
loved
am
i
not
yes
she
answered
and
yet
he
said
taking
her
round
the
waist
and
kissing
her
forehead
at
the
risk
of
being
seen
i
leave
you
pure
and
without
remorse
i
could
have
dragged
you
into
an
abyss
but
you
remain
in
all
your
glory
on
its
brink
without
a
stain
yet
one
thought
troubles
me
what
is
it
she
asked
you
will
despise
she
smiled
superbly
yes
you
will
never
believe
that
i
have
sacredly
loved
you
i
shall
be
disgraced
i
know
that
women
never
imagine
that
from
the
depths
of
our
mire
we
raise
our
eyes
to
heaven
and
truly
adore
a
marie
they
assail
that
sacred
love
with
miserable
doubts
they
can
not
believe
that
men
of
intellect
and
poesy
can
so
detach
their
soul
from
earthly
enjoyment
as
to
lay
it
pure
upon
some
cherished
altar
and
yet
marie
the
worship
of
the
ideal
is
more
fervent
in
men
then
in
women
we
find
it
in
women
who
do
not
even
look
for
it
in
why
are
you
making
me
that
article
she
said
jestingly
i
am
leaving
france
and
you
will
hear
how
and
why
from
a
letter
my
valet
will
bring
you
adieu
raoul
left
the
house
after
again
straining
the
countess
to
his
heart
with
dreadful
pressure
leaving
her
stupefied
and
distressed
what
is
the
matter
my
dear
said
madame
d
espard
coming
to
look
for
her
what
has
monsieur
nathan
been
saying
to
you
he
has
just
left
us
in
a
most
melodramatic
way
perhaps
you
are
too
reasonable
or
too
unreasonable
with
the
countess
got
into
a
and
was
driven
rapidly
to
the
newspaper
office
at
that
hour
the
huge
apartments
which
they
occupied
in
an
old
mansion
in
the
rue
feydeau
were
deserted
not
a
soul
was
there
but
the
watchman
who
was
greatly
surprised
to
see
a
young
and
pretty
woman
hurrying
through
the
rooms
in
evident
distress
she
asked
him
to
tell
her
where
was
monsieur
nathan
at
mademoiselle
florine
s
probably
replied
the
man
taking
marie
for
a
rival
who
intended
to
make
a
scene
where
does
he
work
in
his
office
the
key
of
which
he
carries
in
his
i
wish
to
go
the
man
took
her
to
a
dark
little
room
looking
out
on
a
rear
the
office
was
at
right
angles
opening
the
window
of
the
room
she
was
in
the
countess
could
look
through
into
the
window
of
the
office
and
she
saw
nathan
sitting
there
in
the
editorial
break
in
the
door
and
be
silent
about
all
this
i
ll
pay
you
well
she
said
don
t
you
see
that
monsieur
nathan
is
dying
the
man
got
an
iron
bar
from
the
with
which
he
burst
in
the
door
raoul
had
actually
smothered
himself
like
any
poor
with
a
pan
of
charcoal
he
had
written
a
letter
to
blondet
which
lay
on
the
table
in
which
he
asked
him
to
ascribe
his
death
to
apoplexy
the
countess
however
had
arrived
in
time
she
had
raoul
carried
to
her
coach
and
then
not
knowing
where
else
to
care
for
him
she
took
him
to
a
hotel
engaged
a
room
and
sent
for
a
doctor
in
a
few
hours
raoul
was
out
of
danger
but
the
countess
did
not
leave
him
until
she
had
obtained
a
general
confession
of
the
causes
of
his
act
when
he
had
poured
into
her
heart
the
dreadful
elegy
of
his
woes
she
said
in
order
to
make
him
willing
to
live
i
can
arrange
all
but
nevertheless
she
returned
home
with
a
heart
oppressed
with
the
same
anxieties
and
ideas
that
had
darkened
nathan
s
brow
the
night
before
well
what
was
the
matter
with
your
sister
said
felix
when
his
wife
returned
you
look
it
is
a
dreadful
history
about
which
i
am
bound
to
secrecy
she
said
summoning
all
her
nerve
to
appear
calm
before
him
in
order
to
be
alone
and
to
think
at
her
ease
she
went
to
the
opera
in
the
evening
after
which
she
resolved
to
go
as
we
have
seen
and
discharge
her
heart
into
that
of
her
sister
madame
du
tillet
relating
to
her
the
horrible
scene
of
the
morning
and
begging
her
advice
and
assistance
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
could
then
know
that
du
tillet
himself
had
lighted
the
charcoal
of
the
vulgar
brazier
the
sight
of
which
had
so
justly
terrified
the
countess
he
has
but
me
in
all
the
world
said
marie
to
her
sister
and
i
will
not
fail
that
speech
contains
the
secret
motive
of
most
women
they
can
be
heroic
when
they
are
certain
of
being
all
in
all
to
a
grand
and
irreproachable
being
chapter
viii
a
lover
saved
and
lost
du
tillet
had
heard
some
talk
even
in
financial
circles
of
the
more
or
less
possible
adoration
of
his
for
nathan
but
he
was
one
of
those
who
denied
it
thinking
it
incompatible
with
raoul
s
known
relations
with
florine
the
actress
would
certainly
drive
off
the
countess
or
vice
versa
but
when
on
coming
home
that
evening
he
found
his
with
a
perturbed
face
in
consultation
with
his
wife
about
money
it
occurred
to
him
that
raoul
had
in
all
probability
confided
to
her
his
situation
the
countess
must
therefore
love
him
she
had
doubtless
come
to
obtain
from
her
sister
the
sum
due
to
old
gigonnet
madame
du
tillet
unaware
of
course
of
the
reasons
for
her
husband
s
apparently
supernatural
penetration
had
shown
such
stupefaction
when
he
told
her
the
sum
wanted
that
du
tillet
s
suspicions
became
certainties
he
was
sure
now
that
he
held
the
thread
of
all
nathan
s
possible
manoeuvres
no
one
knew
that
the
unhappy
man
himself
was
in
bed
in
a
small
hotel
in
the
rue
du
mail
under
the
name
of
the
office
watchman
to
whom
marie
had
promised
five
hundred
francs
if
he
kept
silence
as
to
the
events
of
the
preceding
night
and
morning
thus
bribed
the
man
whose
name
was
francois
quillet
went
back
to
the
office
and
left
word
with
the
portress
that
monsieur
nathan
had
been
taken
ill
in
consequence
of
overwork
and
was
resting
du
tillet
was
therefore
not
surprised
at
raoul
s
absence
it
was
natural
for
the
journalist
to
hide
under
any
such
pretence
to
avoid
arrest
when
the
sheriff
s
spies
made
inquiries
they
learned
that
a
lady
had
carried
him
away
in
a
public
coach
early
in
the
morning
but
it
took
three
days
to
ferret
out
the
number
of
the
coach
question
the
driver
and
find
the
hotel
where
the
debtor
was
recovering
his
strength
thus
marie
s
prompt
action
had
really
gained
for
nathan
a
truce
of
four
days
both
sisters
passed
a
cruel
night
such
a
catastrophe
casts
the
lurid
gleams
of
its
charcoal
over
the
whole
of
life
showing
reefs
pools
depths
where
the
eye
has
hitherto
seen
only
summits
and
grandeurs
struck
by
the
horrible
picture
of
a
young
man
lying
back
in
his
chair
to
die
with
the
last
proofs
of
his
paper
before
him
containing
in
type
his
last
thoughts
poor
madame
du
tillet
could
think
of
nothing
else
than
how
to
save
him
and
restore
a
life
so
precious
to
her
sister
it
is
the
nature
of
our
mind
to
see
effects
before
we
analyze
their
causes
eugenie
recurred
to
her
first
idea
of
consulting
madame
delphine
de
nucingen
with
whom
she
was
to
dine
and
she
resolved
to
make
the
attempt
not
doubting
of
success
generous
like
all
persons
who
are
not
bound
in
the
polished
steel
armor
of
modern
society
madame
du
tillet
resolved
to
take
the
whole
matter
upon
herself
the
countess
on
the
other
hand
happy
in
the
thought
that
she
had
saved
raoul
s
life
spent
the
night
in
devising
means
to
obtain
the
forty
thousand
francs
in
emergencies
like
these
women
are
sublime
they
find
contrivances
which
would
astonish
thieves
business
men
and
usurers
if
those
three
classes
of
industrials
were
capable
of
being
astonished
first
the
countess
sold
her
diamonds
and
decided
on
wearing
paste
then
she
resolved
to
ask
the
money
from
vandenesse
on
her
sister
s
account
but
these
were
dishonorable
means
and
her
soul
was
too
noble
not
to
recoil
at
them
she
merely
conceived
them
and
cast
them
from
her
ask
money
of
vandenesse
to
give
to
nathan
she
bounded
in
her
bed
with
horror
at
such
baseness
wear
false
diamonds
to
deceive
her
husband
next
she
thought
of
borrowing
the
money
from
the
rothschilds
who
had
so
much
or
from
the
archbishop
of
paris
whose
mission
it
was
to
help
persons
in
distress
darting
thus
from
thought
to
thought
seeking
help
in
all
she
deplored
belonging
to
a
class
opposed
to
the
government
formerly
she
could
easily
have
borrowed
the
money
on
the
steps
of
the
throne
she
thought
of
appealing
to
her
father
the
comte
de
granville
but
that
great
magistrate
had
a
horror
of
illegalities
his
children
knew
how
little
he
sympathized
with
the
trials
of
love
he
was
now
a
misanthrope
and
held
all
affairs
of
the
heart
in
horror
as
for
the
comtesse
de
granville
she
was
living
a
retired
life
on
one
of
her
estates
in
normandy
economizing
and
praying
ending
her
days
between
priests
and
cold
as
ever
to
her
dying
moment
even
supposing
that
marie
had
time
to
go
to
bayeux
and
implore
her
would
her
mother
give
her
such
a
sum
unless
she
explained
why
she
wanted
it
could
she
say
she
had
debts
yes
perhaps
her
mother
would
be
softened
by
the
wants
of
her
favorite
child
well
then
in
case
all
other
means
failed
she
go
to
normandy
the
dreadful
sight
of
the
morning
the
effects
she
had
made
to
revive
nathan
the
hours
passed
beside
his
pillow
his
broken
confession
the
agony
of
a
great
soul
a
vast
genius
stopped
in
its
upward
flight
by
a
sordid
vulgar
obstacle
all
these
things
rushed
into
her
memory
and
stimulated
her
love
she
went
over
and
over
her
emotions
and
felt
her
love
to
be
deeper
in
these
days
of
misery
than
in
those
of
nathan
s
fame
and
grandeur
she
felt
the
nobility
of
his
last
words
said
to
her
in
lady
dudley
s
boudoir
what
sacredness
in
that
farewell
what
grandeur
in
the
immolation
of
a
selfish
happiness
which
would
have
been
her
torture
the
countess
had
longed
for
emotions
and
now
she
had
them
terrible
cruel
and
yet
most
precious
she
lived
a
deeper
life
in
pain
than
in
pleasure
with
what
delight
she
said
to
herself
i
have
saved
him
once
and
i
will
save
him
she
heard
him
cry
out
when
he
felt
her
lips
upon
his
forehead
many
a
poor
wretch
does
not
know
what
love
is
are
you
ill
said
her
husband
coming
into
her
room
to
take
her
to
breakfast
i
am
dreadfully
worried
about
a
matter
that
is
happening
at
my
sister
s
she
replied
without
actually
telling
a
lie
your
sister
has
fallen
into
bad
hands
replied
felix
it
is
a
shame
for
any
family
to
have
a
du
tillet
in
it
a
man
without
honor
of
any
kind
if
disaster
happened
to
her
she
would
get
no
pity
from
what
woman
wants
pity
said
the
countess
with
a
convulsive
motion
a
man
s
sternness
is
to
us
our
only
this
is
not
the
first
time
that
i
read
your
noble
heart
said
the
count
a
woman
who
thinks
as
you
do
needs
no
watching
she
said
another
shame
that
recoils
on
felix
smiled
but
marie
blushed
when
women
are
secretly
to
blame
they
often
show
ostensibly
the
utmost
womanly
pride
it
is
a
dissimulation
of
mind
for
which
we
ought
to
be
obliged
to
them
the
deception
is
full
of
dignity
if
not
of
grandeur
marie
wrote
two
lines
to
nathan
under
the
name
of
monsieur
quillet
to
tell
him
that
all
went
well
and
sent
them
by
a
street
porter
to
the
hotel
du
mail
that
night
at
the
opera
felix
thought
it
very
natural
that
she
should
wish
to
leave
her
box
and
go
to
that
of
her
sister
and
he
waited
till
du
tillet
had
left
his
wife
to
give
marie
his
arm
and
take
her
there
who
can
tell
what
emotions
agitated
her
as
she
went
through
the
corridors
and
entered
her
sister
s
box
with
a
face
that
was
outwardly
serene
and
calm
well
she
said
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
eugenie
s
face
was
an
answer
it
was
bright
with
a
joy
which
some
persons
might
have
attributed
to
the
satisfaction
of
vanity
he
can
be
saved
dear
but
for
three
months
only
during
which
time
we
must
plan
some
other
means
of
doing
it
permanently
madame
de
nucingen
wants
four
notes
of
hand
each
for
ten
thousand
francs
endorsed
by
any
one
no
matter
who
so
as
not
to
compromise
you
she
explained
to
me
how
they
were
made
but
i
couldn
t
understand
her
monsieur
nathan
however
can
make
them
for
us
i
thought
of
schmucke
our
old
master
i
am
sure
he
could
be
very
useful
in
this
emergency
he
will
endorse
the
notes
you
must
add
to
the
four
notes
a
letter
in
which
you
guarantee
their
payment
to
madame
de
nucingen
and
she
will
give
you
the
money
do
the
whole
thing
yourself
don
t
trust
it
to
any
one
i
feel
sure
that
schmucke
will
make
no
objection
to
divert
all
suspicion
i
told
madame
de
nucingen
you
wanted
to
oblige
our
old
who
was
in
distress
and
i
asked
her
to
keep
the
matter
you
have
the
sense
of
angels
i
only
hope
madame
de
nucingen
won
t
tell
of
it
until
after
she
gives
me
the
money
said
the
countess
schmucke
lives
in
the
rue
de
nevers
on
the
quai
conti
don
t
forget
the
address
and
go
thanks
said
the
countess
pressing
her
sister
s
hand
ah
i
d
give
ten
years
of
life
out
of
your
old
age
if
i
could
put
an
end
to
these
anxieties
said
the
countess
smiling
at
the
interruption
the
persons
who
were
at
that
moment
levelling
their
at
the
two
sisters
might
well
have
supposed
them
engaged
in
some
talk
but
any
observer
who
had
come
to
the
opera
more
for
the
pleasure
of
watching
faces
than
for
mere
idle
amusement
might
have
guessed
them
in
trouble
from
the
anxious
look
which
followed
the
momentary
smiles
on
their
charming
faces
raoul
who
did
not
fear
the
bailiffs
at
night
appeared
pale
and
ashy
with
anxious
eye
and
gloomy
brow
on
the
step
of
the
staircase
where
he
regularly
took
his
stand
he
looked
for
the
countess
in
her
box
and
finding
it
empty
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
leaning
his
elbows
on
the
balustrade
can
she
be
here
he
thought
look
up
unhappy
hero
whispered
mme
du
tillet
as
for
marie
at
all
risks
she
fixed
on
him
that
steady
magnetic
gaze
in
which
the
will
flashes
from
the
eye
as
rays
of
light
from
the
sun
such
a
look
mesmerizers
say
penetrates
to
the
person
on
whom
it
is
directed
and
certainly
raoul
seemed
as
though
struck
by
a
magic
wand
raising
his
head
his
eyes
met
those
of
the
sisters
with
that
charming
feminine
readiness
which
is
never
at
fault
mme
de
vandenesse
seized
a
cross
sparkling
on
her
neck
and
directed
his
attention
to
it
by
a
swift
smile
full
of
meaning
the
brilliance
of
the
gem
radiated
even
upon
raoul
s
forehead
and
he
replied
with
a
look
of
joy
he
had
understood
is
it
nothing
then
eugenie
said
the
countess
thus
to
restore
life
to
the
dead
you
have
a
chance
yet
with
the
royal
humane
society
replied
eugenie
with
a
smile
how
wretched
and
depressed
he
looked
when
he
came
and
how
happy
he
will
go
away
at
this
moment
du
tillet
coming
up
to
raoul
with
every
mark
of
friendliness
pressed
his
hand
and
said
well
old
fellow
how
are
you
as
well
as
a
man
is
likely
to
be
who
has
just
got
the
best
possible
news
of
the
election
i
shall
be
successful
replied
raoul
radiant
delighted
said
du
tillet
we
shall
want
money
for
the
the
money
will
be
found
said
raoul
the
devil
is
with
these
women
exclaimed
du
tillet
still
unconvinced
by
the
words
of
raoul
whom
he
had
nicknamed
charnathan
what
are
you
talking
about
said
raoul
my
is
there
with
my
wife
and
they
are
hatching
something
together
you
seem
in
high
favor
with
the
countess
she
is
bowing
to
you
right
across
the
look
said
mme
du
tillet
to
her
sister
they
told
us
wrong
see
how
my
husband
fawns
on
nathan
and
it
is
he
who
they
declared
was
trying
to
get
him
put
in
prison
and
men
call
us
slanderers
cried
the
countess
i
will
give
him
a
she
rose
took
the
arm
of
vandenesse
who
was
waiting
in
the
passage
and
returned
jubilant
to
her
box
by
and
by
she
left
the
opera
and
ordered
her
carriage
for
the
next
morning
before
eight
o
clock
the
next
morning
by
eight
marie
had
driven
to
the
quai
conti
stopping
at
the
hotel
du
mail
on
her
way
the
carriage
could
not
enter
the
narrow
rue
de
nevers
but
as
schmucke
lived
in
a
house
at
the
corner
of
the
quai
she
was
not
obliged
to
walk
up
its
muddy
pavement
but
could
jump
from
the
step
of
her
carriage
to
the
broken
step
of
the
dismal
old
house
mended
like
porter
s
crockery
with
iron
rivets
and
bulging
out
over
the
street
in
a
way
that
was
quite
alarming
to
pedestrians
the
old
lived
on
the
fourth
floor
and
enjoyed
a
fine
view
of
the
seine
from
the
pont
neuf
to
the
heights
of
chaillot
the
good
soul
was
so
surprised
when
the
countess
s
footman
announced
the
visit
of
his
former
scholar
that
in
his
stupefaction
he
let
her
enter
without
going
down
to
receive
her
never
did
the
countess
suspect
or
imagine
such
an
existence
as
that
which
suddenly
revealed
itself
to
her
eyes
though
she
had
long
known
schmucke
s
contempt
for
dress
and
the
little
interest
he
held
in
the
affairs
of
this
world
but
who
could
have
believed
in
such
complete
indifference
in
the
utter
of
such
a
life
schmucke
was
a
musical
diogenes
and
he
felt
no
shame
whatever
in
his
untidiness
in
fact
he
was
so
accustomed
to
it
that
he
would
probably
have
denied
its
existence
the
incessant
smoking
of
a
stout
german
pipe
had
spread
upon
the
ceiling
and
over
a
wretched
scratched
and
defaced
by
the
cat
a
yellowish
tinge
the
cat
a
magnificently
fluffy
animal
the
envy
of
all
portresses
presided
there
like
the
mistress
of
the
house
grave
and
sedate
and
without
anxieties
on
the
top
of
an
excellent
viennese
piano
he
sat
majestically
and
cast
upon
the
countess
as
she
entered
that
coldly
gracious
look
which
a
woman
surprised
by
the
beauty
of
another
woman
might
have
given
he
did
not
move
and
merely
waved
the
two
silver
threads
of
his
right
whisker
as
he
turned
his
golden
eyes
on
schmucke
the
piano
decrepit
on
its
legs
though
made
of
good
wood
painted
black
and
gilded
was
dirty
defaced
and
scratched
and
its
keys
worn
like
the
teeth
of
old
horses
were
yellowed
with
the
fuliginous
colors
of
the
pipe
on
the
desk
a
little
heap
of
ashes
showed
that
the
night
before
schmucke
had
bestrode
the
old
instrument
to
some
musical
walhalla
the
floor
covered
with
dried
mud
torn
papers
fragments
indescribable
was
like
that
of
a
boy
s
unswept
for
a
week
on
which
a
mound
of
things
accumulate
half
rags
half
filth
a
more
practised
eye
than
that
of
the
countess
would
have
seen
certain
other
revelations
of
schmucke
s
mode
of
life
dyed
red
in
broken
dishes
smeared
with
this
german
detritus
formed
a
carpet
of
dusty
filth
which
crackled
under
foot
joining
company
near
the
hearth
with
a
mass
of
cinders
and
ashes
descending
majestically
from
the
fireplace
where
lay
a
block
of
coal
before
which
two
slender
twigs
made
a
show
of
burning
on
the
was
a
mirror
in
a
painted
frame
adorned
with
figures
dancing
a
saraband
on
one
side
hung
the
glorious
pipe
on
the
other
was
a
chinese
jar
in
which
the
musician
kept
his
tobacco
two
bought
at
auction
a
thin
and
rickety
cot
a
bureau
without
a
top
a
maimed
table
on
which
lay
the
remains
of
a
frugal
breakfast
made
up
a
set
of
household
belongings
as
plain
as
those
of
an
indian
wigwam
a
suspended
to
the
fastening
of
a
curtainless
window
and
surmounted
by
a
rag
striped
by
many
wipings
of
a
razor
indicated
the
only
sacrifices
paid
by
schmucke
to
the
graces
and
society
the
cat
being
the
feebler
and
protected
partner
had
rather
the
best
of
the
establishment
he
enjoyed
the
comforts
of
an
old
near
which
could
be
seen
a
white
china
cup
and
plate
but
what
no
pen
can
describe
was
the
state
into
which
schmucke
the
cat
and
the
pipe
that
existing
trinity
had
reduced
these
articles
the
pipe
had
burned
the
table
the
cat
and
schmucke
s
head
had
greased
the
green
utrecht
velvet
of
the
two
and
reduced
it
to
a
slimy
texture
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
cat
s
magnificent
tail
which
played
a
useful
part
in
the
household
the
uncovered
places
on
the
bureau
and
the
piano
would
never
have
been
dusted
in
one
corner
of
the
room
were
a
pile
of
shoes
which
need
an
epic
to
describe
them
the
top
of
the
bureau
and
that
of
the
piano
were
encumbered
by
with
ragged
backs
and
whitened
corners
through
which
the
pasteboard
showed
its
many
layers
along
the
walls
the
names
and
addresses
of
pupils
written
on
scraps
of
paper
were
stuck
on
by
wafers
the
number
of
wafers
without
paper
indicating
the
number
of
pupils
no
longer
taught
on
the
were
many
calculations
written
with
chalk
the
bureau
was
decorated
with
used
the
night
before
their
newness
appearing
very
brilliant
in
the
midst
of
this
rubbish
of
dirt
and
age
hygiene
was
represented
by
a
jug
of
water
with
a
towel
laid
upon
it
and
a
bit
of
common
soap
two
ancient
hats
hung
to
their
respective
nails
near
which
also
hung
the
blue
with
three
capes
in
which
the
countess
had
always
seen
schmucke
when
he
came
to
give
his
lessons
on
the
were
three
pots
of
flowers
german
flowers
no
doubt
and
near
them
a
stout
stick
though
marie
s
sight
and
smell
were
disagreeably
affected
schmucke
s
smile
and
glance
disguised
these
abject
miseries
by
rays
of
celestial
light
which
actually
illuminated
their
smoky
tones
and
vivified
the
chaos
the
soul
of
this
dear
man
which
saw
and
revealed
so
many
things
divine
shone
like
the
sun
his
laugh
so
frank
so
guileless
at
seeing
one
of
his
shed
sparkles
of
youth
and
gaiety
and
innocence
about
him
the
treasures
he
poured
from
the
inner
to
the
outer
were
like
a
mantle
with
which
he
covered
his
squalid
life
the
most
supercilious
parvenu
would
have
felt
it
ignoble
to
care
for
the
frame
in
which
this
glorious
old
apostle
of
the
musical
religion
lived
and
moved
and
had
his
being
hey
by
what
good
luck
do
i
see
you
here
dear
madame
la
comtesse
he
said
must
i
sing
the
canticle
of
simeon
at
my
age
this
idea
so
tickled
him
that
he
laughed
immoderately
truly
i
m
en
bonne
and
again
he
laughed
like
a
merry
child
but
ah
he
said
changing
to
melancholy
you
come
for
the
music
and
not
for
a
poor
old
man
like
me
yes
i
know
that
but
come
for
what
you
will
i
am
yours
you
know
body
and
soul
and
all
i
have
this
was
said
in
his
unspeakable
german
accent
a
rendition
of
which
we
spare
the
reader
he
took
the
countess
s
hand
kissed
it
and
left
a
tear
there
for
the
worthy
soul
was
always
on
the
morrow
of
her
benefit
then
he
seized
a
bit
of
chalk
jumped
on
a
chair
in
front
of
the
piano
and
wrote
upon
the
wall
in
big
letters
with
the
rapidity
of
a
young
man
february
this
pretty
artless
action
done
in
such
a
passion
of
gratitude
touched
the
countess
to
tears
my
sister
will
come
too
she
said
the
other
too
when
when
god
grant
it
be
before
i
die
she
will
come
to
thank
you
for
a
great
service
i
am
now
here
to
ask
of
quick
quick
tell
me
what
it
is
cried
schmucke
what
must
i
do

to
the
devil
nothing
more
than
write
the
words
accepted
for
ten
thousand
francs
and
sign
your
name
on
each
of
these
papers
she
said
taking
from
her
muff
four
notes
prepared
for
her
by
nathan
hey
that
s
soon
done
replied
the
german
with
the
docility
of
a
lamb
only
i
m
sure
i
don
t
know
where
my
pens
and
ink
are
get
away
from
there
meinherr

he
cried
to
the
cat
which
looked
composedly
at
him
that
s
my
cat
he
said
showing
him
to
the
countess
that
s
the
poor
animal
that
lives
with
poor
schmucke
hasn
t
he
fine
fur
yes
said
the
countess
will
you
have
him
he
cried
how
can
you
think
of
such
a
thing
she
answered
why
he
s
your
friend
the
cat
who
hid
the
inkstand
behind
him
divined
that
schmucke
wanted
it
and
jumped
to
the
bed
he
s
as
mischievous
as
a
monkey
said
schmucke
i
call
him
mirr
in
honor
of
our
great
hoffman
of
berlin
whom
i
knew
the
good
man
signed
the
papers
with
the
innocence
of
a
child
who
does
what
his
mother
orders
without
question
so
sure
is
he
that
all
is
right
he
was
thinking
much
more
of
presenting
the
cat
to
the
countess
than
of
the
papers
by
which
his
liberty
might
be
according
to
the
laws
relating
to
foreigners
forever
sacrificed
you
assure
me
that
these
little
papers
with
the
stamps
on
them
don
t
be
in
the
least
uneasy
said
the
countess
i
am
not
uneasy
he
said
hastily
i
only
meant
to
ask
if
these
little
papers
will
give
pleasure
to
madame
du
oh
yes
she
said
you
are
doing
her
a
service
as
if
you
were
her
i
am
happy
indeed
to
be
of
any
good
to
her
come
and
listen
to
my
music
and
leaving
the
papers
on
the
table
he
jumped
to
his
piano
the
hands
of
this
angel
ran
along
the
yellowing
keys
his
glance
was
rising
to
heaven
regardless
of
the
roof
already
the
air
of
some
blessed
climate
permeated
the
room
and
the
soul
of
the
old
musician
but
the
countess
did
not
allow
the
artless
interpreter
of
things
celestial
to
make
the
strings
and
the
worn
wood
speak
like
raffaelle
s
saint
cecilia
to
the
listening
angels
she
quickly
slipped
the
notes
into
her
muff
and
recalled
her
radiant
master
from
the
ethereal
spheres
to
which
he
soared
by
laying
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder
my
good
schmucke
she
said
going
already
he
cried
ah
why
did
you
come
he
did
not
murmur
but
he
sat
up
like
a
faithful
dog
who
listens
to
his
mistress
my
good
schmucke
she
repeated
this
is
a
matter
of
life
and
death
minutes
can
save
tears
perhaps
always
the
same
he
said
go
angel
dry
the
tears
of
others
your
poor
schmucke
thinks
more
of
your
visit
than
of
your
but
we
must
see
each
other
often
she
said
you
must
come
and
dine
and
play
to
me
every
sunday
or
we
shall
quarrel
remember
i
shall
expect
you
next
really
and
truly
yes
i
entreat
you
and
my
sister
will
want
you
too
for
another
then
my
happiness
will
be
complete
he
said
for
i
only
see
you
now
in
the
champs
elysees
as
you
pass
in
your
carriage
and
that
is
very
this
thought
dried
the
tears
in
his
eyes
as
he
gave
his
arm
to
his
beautiful
pupil
who
felt
the
old
man
s
heart
beat
violently
you
think
of
us
she
said
always
as
i
eat
my
food
he
answered
as
my
benefactresses
but
chiefly
as
the
first
young
girls
worthy
of
love
whom
i
ever
so
respectful
faithful
and
religious
a
solemnity
was
in
this
speech
that
the
countess
dared
say
no
more
that
smoky
chamber
full
of
dirt
and
rubbish
was
the
temple
of
the
two
divinities
there
we
are
loved
and
truly
loved
she
thought
the
emotion
with
which
old
schmucke
saw
the
countess
get
into
her
carriage
and
leave
him
she
fully
shared
and
she
sent
him
from
the
tips
of
her
fingers
one
of
those
pretty
kisses
which
women
give
each
other
from
afar
receiving
it
the
old
man
stood
planted
on
his
feet
for
a
long
time
after
the
carriage
had
disappeared
a
few
moments
later
the
countess
entered
the
of
the
hotel
de
nucingen
madame
de
nucingen
was
not
yet
up
but
anxious
not
to
keep
a
woman
of
the
countess
s
position
waiting
she
hastily
threw
on
a
shawl
and
wrapper
my
visit
concerns
a
charitable
action
madame
said
the
countess
or
i
would
not
disturb
you
at
so
early
an
but
i
am
only
too
happy
to
be
disturbed
said
the
banker
s
wife
taking
the
notes
and
the
countess
s
guarantee
she
rang
for
her
maid
therese
she
said
tell
the
cashier
to
bring
me
up
himself
immediately
forty
thousand
then
she
locked
into
a
table
drawer
the
guarantee
given
by
madame
de
vandenesse
after
sealing
it
up
you
have
a
delightful
room
said
the
countess
yes
but
monsieur
de
nucingen
is
going
to
take
it
from
me
he
is
building
a
new
you
will
doubtless
give
this
one
to
your
daughter
who
i
am
told
is
to
marry
monsieur
de
the
cashier
appeared
at
this
moment
with
the
money
madame
de
nucingen
took
the
and
gave
him
the
notes
of
hand
that
balances
she
said
except
the
discount
replied
the
cashier
ha
schmucke
that
s
the
musician
of
anspach
he
added
examining
the
signatures
in
a
suspicious
manner
that
made
the
countess
tremble
who
is
doing
this
business
said
madame
de
nucingen
with
a
haughty
glance
at
the
cashier
this
is
my
the
cashier
looked
alternately
at
the
two
ladies
but
he
could
discover
nothing
on
their
impenetrable
faces
go
leave
us
have
the
kindness
to
wait
a
few
moments
that
the
people
in
the
bank
may
not
connect
you
with
this
negotiation
said
madame
de
nucingen
to
the
countess
i
must
ask
you
to
add
to
all
your
other
kindness
that
of
keeping
this
matter
secret
said
madame
de
vandenesse
most
assuredly
since
it
is
for
charity
replied
the
baroness
smiling
i
will
send
your
carriage
round
to
the
garden
gate
so
that
no
one
will
see
you
leave
the
you
have
the
thoughtful
grace
of
a
person
who
has
suffered
said
the
countess
i
do
not
know
if
i
have
grace
said
the
baroness
but
i
have
suffered
much
i
hope
that
your
anxieties
cost
less
than
when
a
man
has
laid
a
plot
like
that
du
tillet
was
scheming
against
nathan
he
confides
it
to
no
man
nucingen
knew
something
of
it
but
his
wife
knew
nothing
the
baroness
however
aware
that
raoul
was
embarrassed
was
not
the
dupe
of
the
two
sisters
she
guessed
into
whose
hands
that
money
was
to
go
and
she
was
delighted
to
oblige
the
countess
moreover
she
felt
a
deep
compassion
for
all
such
embarrassments
rastignac
so
placed
that
he
was
able
to
fathom
the
manoeuvres
of
the
two
bankers
came
to
breakfast
that
morning
with
madame
de
nucingen
delphine
and
rastignac
had
no
secrets
from
each
other
and
the
baroness
related
to
him
her
scene
with
the
countess
eugene
who
had
never
supposed
that
delphine
could
be
mixed
up
in
the
affair
which
was
only
accessory
to
his
eyes
one
means
among
many
others
opened
her
eyes
to
the
truth
she
had
probably
he
told
her
destroyed
du
tillet
s
chances
of
selection
and
rendered
useless
the
intrigues
and
deceptions
of
the
past
year
in
short
he
put
her
in
the
secret
of
the
whole
affair
advising
her
to
keep
absolute
silence
as
to
the
mistake
she
had
just
committed
provided
the
cashier
does
not
tell
nucingen
she
said
a
few
moments
after
while
du
tillet
was
breakfasting
monsieur
gigonnet
was
announced
let
him
come
in
said
the
banker
though
his
wife
was
at
table
well
my
old
shylock
is
our
man
locked
up
why
not
didn
t
i
give
you
the
address
rue
du
mail
hotel
he
has
paid
up
said
gigonnet
drawing
from
his
wallet
a
pile
of
du
tillet
looked
furious
you
should
never
frown
at
money
said
his
impassible
associate
it
brings
where
did
you
get
that
money
madame
said
du
tillet
suddenly
turning
upon
his
wife
with
a
look
which
made
her
color
to
the
roots
of
her
hair
i
don
t
know
what
your
question
means
she
said
i
will
fathom
this
mystery
he
cried
springing
furiously
up
you
have
upset
my
most
cherished
you
are
upsetting
your
breakfast
said
gigonnet
arresting
the
which
was
dragged
by
the
skirt
of
du
tillet
s
madame
du
tillet
rose
to
leave
the
room
for
her
husband
s
words
alarmed
her
she
rang
the
bell
and
a
footman
entered
the
carriage
she
said
and
call
virginie
i
wish
to
where
are
you
going
exclaimed
du
tillet
husbands
do
not
question
their
wives
she
answered
i
believe
that
you
lay
claim
to
be
a
i
don
t
recognize
you
ever
since
you
have
seen
more
of
your
impertinent
you
ordered
me
to
be
impertinent
and
i
am
practising
on
you
she
replied
your
servant
madame
said
gigonnet
taking
leave
not
anxious
to
witness
this
family
scene
du
tillet
looked
fixedly
at
his
wife
who
returned
the
look
without
lowering
her
eyes
what
does
all
this
mean
he
said
it
means
that
i
am
no
longer
a
little
girl
whom
you
can
frighten
she
replied
i
am
and
shall
be
all
my
life
a
good
and
loyal
wife
to
you
you
may
be
my
master
if
you
choose
my
tyrant
never
du
tillet
left
the
room
after
this
effort
broke
down
if
it
were
not
for
my
sister
s
danger
she
said
to
herself
i
should
never
have
dared
to
brave
him
thus
but
as
the
proverb
says
there
s
some
good
in
every
chapter
ix
the
husband
s
triumph
during
the
preceding
night
madame
du
tillet
had
gone
over
in
her
mind
her
sister
s
revelations
sure
now
of
nathan
s
safety
she
was
no
longer
influenced
by
the
thought
of
an
imminent
danger
in
that
direction
but
she
remembered
the
vehement
energy
with
which
the
countess
had
declared
that
she
would
fly
with
nathan
if
that
would
save
him
she
saw
that
the
man
might
determine
her
sister
in
some
paroxysm
of
gratitude
and
love
to
take
a
step
which
was
nothing
short
of
madness
there
were
recent
examples
in
the
highest
society
of
just
such
flights
which
paid
for
doubtful
pleasures
by
lasting
remorse
and
the
disrepute
of
a
false
position
du
tillet
s
speech
brought
her
fears
to
a
point
she
dreaded
lest
all
should
be
discovered
she
knew
her
sister
s
signature
was
in
nucingen
s
hands
and
she
resolved
to
entreat
marie
to
save
herself
by
confessing
all
to
felix
she
drove
to
her
sister
s
house
but
marie
was
not
at
home
felix
was
there
a
voice
within
her
cried
aloud
to
eugenie
to
save
her
sister
the
morrow
might
be
too
late
she
took
a
vast
responsibility
upon
herself
but
she
resolved
to
tell
all
to
the
count
surely
he
would
be
indulgent
when
he
knew
that
his
honor
was
still
safe
the
countess
was
deluded
rather
than
sinful
eugenie
feared
to
be
treacherous
and
base
in
revealing
secrets
that
society
agreeing
on
this
point
holds
to
be
inviolable
but
she
saw
her
sister
s
future
she
trembled
lest
she
should
some
day
be
deserted
ruined
by
nathan
poor
suffering
disgraced
wretched
and
she
hesitated
no
longer
she
sent
in
her
name
and
asked
to
see
the
count
felix
astonished
at
the
visit
had
a
long
conversation
with
his
in
which
he
seemed
so
calm
so
completely
master
of
himself
that
she
feared
he
might
have
taken
some
terrible
resolution
do
not
be
uneasy
he
said
seeing
her
anxiety
i
will
act
in
a
manner
which
shall
make
your
sister
bless
you
however
much
you
may
dislike
to
keep
the
fact
that
you
have
spoken
to
me
from
her
knowledge
i
must
entreat
you
to
do
so
i
need
a
few
days
to
search
into
mysteries
which
you
don
t
perceive
and
above
all
i
must
act
cautiously
perhaps
i
can
learn
all
in
a
day
i
alone
my
dear
sister
am
the
guilty
person
all
lovers
play
their
game
and
it
is
not
every
woman
who
is
able
unassisted
to
see
life
as
it
madame
du
tillet
returned
home
comforted
felix
de
vandenesse
drew
forty
thousand
francs
from
the
bank
of
france
and
went
direct
to
madame
de
nucingen
he
found
her
at
home
thanked
her
for
the
confidence
she
had
placed
in
his
wife
and
returned
the
money
explaining
that
the
countess
had
obtained
this
mysterious
loan
for
her
charities
which
were
so
profuse
that
he
was
trying
to
put
a
limit
to
them
give
me
no
explanations
monsieur
since
madame
de
vandenesse
has
told
you
all
said
the
baronne
de
nucingen
she
knows
the
truth
thought
vandenesse
madame
de
nucingen
returned
to
him
marie
s
letter
of
guarantee
and
sent
to
the
bank
for
the
four
notes
vandenesse
during
the
short
time
that
these
arrangements
kept
him
waiting
watched
the
baroness
with
the
eye
of
a
statesman
and
he
thought
the
moment
propitious
for
further
negotiation
we
live
in
an
age
madame
when
nothing
is
sure
he
said
even
thrones
rise
and
fall
in
france
with
fearful
rapidity
fifteen
years
have
wreaked
their
will
on
a
great
empire
a
monarchy
and
a
revolution
no
one
can
now
dare
to
count
upon
the
future
you
know
my
attachment
to
the
cause
of
legitimacy
suppose
some
catastrophe
would
you
not
be
glad
to
have
a
friend
in
the
conquering
party
undoubtedly
she
said
smiling
very
good
then
will
you
have
in
me
secretly
an
obliged
friend
who
could
be
of
use
to
monsieur
de
nucingen
in
such
a
case
by
supporting
his
claim
to
the
peerage
he
is
seeking
what
do
you
want
of
me
she
asked
very
little
he
replied
all
that
you
know
about
nathan
s
the
baroness
repeated
to
him
her
conversation
with
rastignac
and
said
as
she
gave
him
the
four
notes
which
the
cashier
had
meantime
brought
to
her
don
t
forget
your
so
little
did
vandenesse
forget
this
illusive
promise
that
he
used
it
again
on
baron
eugene
de
rastignac
to
obtain
from
him
certain
other
information
leaving
rastignac
s
apartments
he
dictated
to
a
street
amanuensis
the
following
note
to
florine
if
mademoiselle
florine
wishes
to
know
of
a
part
she
may
play
she
is
requested
to
come
to
the
masked
opera
at
the
opera
next
sunday
night
accompanied
by
monsieur
to
this
ball
he
determined
to
take
his
wife
and
let
her
own
eyes
enlighten
her
as
to
the
relations
between
nathan
and
florine
he
knew
the
jealous
pride
of
the
countess
he
wanted
to
make
her
renounce
her
love
of
her
own
will
without
causing
her
to
blush
before
him
and
then
to
return
to
her
her
own
letters
sold
by
florine
from
whom
he
expected
to
be
able
to
buy
them
this
judicious
plan
rapidly
conceived
and
partly
executed
might
fail
through
some
trick
of
chance
which
meddles
with
all
things
here
below
after
dinner
that
evening
felix
brought
the
conversation
round
to
the
masked
balls
of
the
opera
remarking
that
marie
had
never
been
to
one
and
proposing
that
she
should
accompany
him
the
following
evening
i
ll
find
you
some
one
to
intriguer
he
said
ah
i
wish
you
would
she
replied
to
do
the
thing
well
a
woman
ought
to
fasten
upon
some
good
prey
a
celebrity
a
man
of
enough
wit
to
give
and
take
there
s
nathan
will
you
have
him
i
know
through
a
friend
of
florine
certain
secrets
of
his
which
would
drive
him
florine
said
the
countess
do
you
mean
the
actress
marie
had
already
heard
that
name
from
the
lips
of
the
watchman
quillet
it
now
shot
like
a
flash
of
lightning
through
her
soul
yes
his
mistress
replied
the
count
what
is
there
so
surprising
in
that
i
thought
monsieur
nathan
too
busy
to
have
a
mistress
do
authors
have
time
to
make
love
i
don
t
say
they
love
my
dear
but
they
are
forced
to
somewhere
like
other
men
and
when
they
haven
t
a
home
of
their
own
they
with
their
mistresses
which
may
seem
to
you
rather
loose
but
it
is
far
more
agreeable
than
lodging
in
a
fire
was
less
red
than
marie
s
cheeks
will
you
have
him
for
a
victim
i
can
help
you
to
terrify
him
continued
the
count
not
looking
at
his
wife
s
face
i
ll
put
you
in
the
way
of
proving
to
him
that
he
is
being
tricked
like
a
child
by
your
du
tillet
that
wretch
is
trying
to
put
nathan
in
prison
so
as
to
make
him
ineligible
to
stand
against
him
in
the
electoral
college
i
know
through
a
friend
of
florine
the
exact
sum
derived
from
the
sale
of
her
furniture
which
she
gave
to
nathan
to
found
his
newspaper
i
know
too
what
she
sent
him
out
of
her
summer
s
harvest
in
the
departments
and
in
belgium
money
which
has
really
gone
to
the
profit
of
du
tillet
nucingen
and
massol
all
three
of
them
unknown
to
nathan
have
privately
sold
the
paper
to
the
new
ministry
so
sure
are
they
of
ejecting
monsieur
nathan
is
incapable
of
accepting
money
from
an
you
don
t
know
that
class
of
people
my
dear
said
the
count
he
would
not
deny
the
fact
if
you
asked
i
will
certainly
go
to
the
ball
said
the
countess
you
will
be
very
much
amused
replied
vandenesse
with
such
weapons
in
hand
you
can
cut
nathan
s
complacency
to
the
quick
and
you
will
also
do
him
a
great
service
you
will
put
him
in
a
fury
he
ll
try
to
be
calm
though
inwardly
fuming
but
all
the
same
you
will
enlighten
a
man
of
talent
as
to
the
peril
in
which
he
really
stands
and
you
will
also
have
the
satisfaction
of
laming
the
horses
of
the
in
their
stalls
but
you
are
not
listening
to
me
my
on
the
contrary
i
am
listening
intently
she
said
i
will
tell
you
later
why
i
feel
desirous
to
know
the
truth
of
all
you
shall
know
it
said
vandenesse
if
you
stay
masked
i
will
take
you
to
supper
with
nathan
and
florine
it
would
be
rather
amusing
for
a
woman
of
your
rank
to
fool
an
actress
after
bewildering
the
wits
of
a
clever
man
about
these
important
facts
you
can
harness
them
both
to
the
same
hoax
i
ll
make
some
inquiries
about
nathan
s
infidelities
and
if
i
discover
any
of
his
recent
adventures
you
shall
enjoy
the
sight
of
a
courtesan
s
fury
it
is
magnificent
florine
will
boil
and
foam
like
an
alpine
torrent
she
adores
nathan
he
is
everything
to
her
she
clings
to
him
like
flesh
to
the
bones
or
a
lioness
to
her
cubs
i
remember
seeing
in
my
youth
a
celebrated
actress
who
wrote
like
a
scullion
when
she
came
to
a
friend
of
mine
to
demand
her
letters
i
have
never
seen
such
a
sight
again
such
calm
fury
such
insolent
majesty
such
savage
are
you
ill
marie
no
they
have
made
too
much
the
countess
turned
away
and
threw
herself
on
a
sofa
suddenly
with
an
unforeseen
movement
impelled
by
the
horrible
anguish
of
her
jealousy
she
rose
on
her
trembling
legs
crossed
her
arms
and
came
slowly
to
her
husband
what
do
you
know
she
asked
you
are
not
a
man
to
torture
me
you
would
crush
me
without
making
me
suffer
if
i
were
what
do
you
expect
me
to
know
marie
well
about
you
think
you
love
him
he
replied
but
you
love
a
phantom
made
of
then
you
know
all
he
said
the
word
fell
on
marie
s
head
like
the
blow
of
a
club
if
you
wish
it
i
will
know
nothing
he
continued
you
are
standing
on
the
brink
of
a
precipice
my
child
and
i
must
draw
you
from
it
i
have
already
done
something
see
he
drew
from
his
pocket
her
letter
of
guarantee
and
the
four
notes
endorsed
by
schmucke
and
let
the
countess
recognize
them
then
he
threw
them
into
the
fire
what
would
have
happened
to
you
my
poor
marie
three
months
hence
he
said
the
sheriffs
would
have
taken
you
to
a
public
don
t
bow
your
head
don
t
feel
humiliated
you
have
been
the
dupe
of
noble
feelings
you
have
coquetted
with
poesy
not
with
a
man
all
women
all
do
you
hear
me
marie
would
have
been
seduced
in
your
position
how
absurd
we
should
be
we
men
we
who
have
committed
a
thousand
follies
through
a
score
of
years
if
we
were
not
willing
to
grant
you
one
imprudence
in
a
lifetime
god
keep
me
from
triumphing
over
you
or
from
offering
you
a
pity
you
repelled
so
vehemently
the
other
day
perhaps
that
unfortunate
man
was
sincere
when
he
wrote
to
you
sincere
in
attempting
to
kill
himself
sincere
in
returning
that
same
night
to
florine
men
are
worth
less
than
women
it
is
not
for
my
own
sake
that
i
speak
at
this
moment
but
for
yours
i
am
indulgent
but
the
world
is
not
it
shuns
a
woman
who
makes
a
scandal
is
that
just
i
know
not
but
this
i
know
the
world
is
cruel
society
refuses
to
calm
the
woes
itself
has
caused
it
gives
its
honors
to
those
who
best
deceive
it
it
has
no
recompense
for
rash
devotion
i
see
and
know
all
that
i
can
t
reform
society
but
this
i
can
do
i
can
protect
you
marie
against
yourself
this
matter
concerns
a
man
who
has
brought
you
trouble
only
and
not
one
of
those
high
and
sacred
loves
which
do
at
times
command
our
abnegation
and
even
bear
their
own
excuse
perhaps
i
have
been
wrong
in
not
varying
your
happiness
in
not
providing
you
with
gayer
pleasures
travel
amusements
distractions
for
the
mind
besides
i
can
explain
to
myself
the
impulse
that
has
driven
you
to
a
celebrated
man
by
the
jealous
envy
you
have
roused
in
certain
women
lady
dudley
madame
d
espard
and
my
emilie
count
for
something
in
all
this
those
women
against
whom
i
ought
to
have
put
you
more
thoroughly
on
your
guard
have
cultivated
your
curiosity
more
to
trouble
me
and
cause
me
unhappiness
than
to
fling
you
into
a
whirlpool
which
as
i
believe
you
would
never
have
as
she
listened
to
these
words
so
full
of
kindness
the
countess
was
torn
by
many
conflicting
feelings
but
the
storm
within
her
breast
was
ruled
by
one
of
them
a
keen
admiration
for
her
husband
proud
and
noble
souls
are
prompt
to
recognize
the
delicacy
with
which
they
are
treated
tact
is
to
sentiments
what
grace
is
to
the
body
marie
appreciated
the
grandeur
of
the
man
who
bowed
before
a
woman
in
fault
that
he
might
not
see
her
blush
she
ran
from
the
room
like
one
beside
herself
but
instantly
returned
fearing
lest
her
hasty
action
might
cause
him
uneasiness
wait
she
said
and
disappeared
again
felix
had
ably
prepared
her
excuse
and
he
was
instantly
rewarded
for
his
generosity
his
wife
returned
with
nathan
s
letters
in
her
hand
and
gave
them
to
him
judge
me
she
said
kneeling
down
beside
him
are
we
able
to
judge
where
we
love
he
answered
throwing
the
letters
into
the
fire
for
he
felt
that
later
his
wife
might
not
forgive
him
for
having
read
them
marie
with
her
head
upon
his
knee
burst
into
tears
my
child
he
said
raising
her
head
where
are
your
letters
at
this
question
the
poor
woman
no
longer
felt
the
intolerable
burning
of
her
cheeks
she
turned
cold
that
you
may
not
suspect
me
of
calumniating
a
man
whom
you
think
worthy
of
you
i
will
make
florine
herself
return
you
those
oh
surely
he
would
give
them
back
to
me
suppose
that
he
refused
to
do
so
the
countess
dropped
her
head
the
world
disgusts
me
she
said
i
don
t
want
to
enter
it
again
i
want
to
live
alone
with
you
if
you
forgive
but
you
might
get
bored
again
besides
what
would
the
world
say
if
you
left
it
so
abruptly
in
the
spring
we
will
travel
we
will
go
to
italy
and
all
over
europe
you
shall
see
life
but
night
we
must
go
to
the
there
is
no
other
way
to
get
those
letters
without
compromising
you
besides
by
giving
them
up
florine
will
prove
to
you
her
and
must
i
see
that
said
the
countess
frightened
the
next
evening
about
midnight
nathan
was
walking
about
the
foyer
of
the
opera
with
a
mask
on
his
arm
to
whom
he
was
attending
in
a
sufficiently
conjugal
manner
presently
two
masked
women
came
up
to
him
you
poor
fool
marie
is
here
and
is
watching
you
said
one
of
them
who
was
vandenesse
disguised
as
a
woman
if
you
choose
to
listen
to
me
i
will
tell
you
secrets
that
nathan
is
hiding
from
you
said
the
other
woman
who
was
the
countess
to
florine
nathan
had
abruptly
dropped
florine
s
arm
to
follow
the
count
who
adroitly
slipped
into
the
crowd
and
was
out
of
sight
in
a
moment
florine
followed
the
countess
who
sat
down
on
a
seat
close
at
hand
to
which
the
count
doubling
on
nathan
returned
almost
immediately
to
guard
his
wife
explain
yourself
my
dear
said
florine
and
don
t
think
i
shall
stand
this
long
no
one
can
tear
raoul
from
me
i
ll
tell
you
that
i
hold
him
by
habit
and
that
s
even
stronger
than
in
the
first
place
are
you
florine
said
the
count
speaking
in
his
natural
voice
a
pretty
question
if
you
don
t
know
that
my
joking
friend
why
should
i
believe
you
go
and
ask
nathan
who
has
left
you
to
look
for
his
other
mistress
where
he
passed
the
night
three
days
ago
he
tried
to
kill
himself
without
a
word
to
you
my
dear
and
all
for
want
of
money
that
shows
how
much
you
know
about
the
affairs
of
a
man
whom
you
say
you
love
and
who
leaves
you
without
a
penny
and
kills
himself
or
rather
doesn
t
kill
himself
for
he
misses
it
suicides
that
don
t
kill
are
about
as
absurd
as
a
duel
without
a
that
s
a
lie
said
florine
he
dined
with
me
that
very
day
the
poor
fellow
had
the
sheriff
after
him
he
was
hiding
as
well
he
go
and
ask
at
the
hotel
du
mail
rue
du
mail
if
he
was
not
taken
there
that
morning
half
dead
of
the
fumes
of
charcoal
by
a
handsome
young
woman
with
whom
he
has
been
in
love
over
a
year
her
letters
are
at
this
moment
under
your
very
nose
in
your
own
house
if
you
want
to
teach
nathan
a
good
lesson
let
us
all
three
go
there
and
i
ll
show
you
papers
in
hand
how
you
can
save
him
from
the
sheriff
and
clichy
if
you
choose
to
be
the
good
girl
that
you
try
that
on
others
than
florine
my
little
man
i
am
certain
that
nathan
has
never
been
in
love
with
any
one
but
on
the
contrary
he
has
been
in
love
with
a
woman
in
society
for
over
a
year
a
woman
in
society
he
cried
florine
i
don
t
trouble
myself
about
such
nonsense
as
well
do
you
want
me
to
make
him
come
and
tell
you
that
he
will
not
take
you
home
from
here
if
you
can
make
him
tell
me
that
said
florine
i
ll
take
home
and
we
ll
look
for
those
letters
which
i
shall
believe
in
when
i
see
them
and
not
till
then
he
must
have
written
them
while
i
stay
here
said
felix
and
so
saying
he
took
the
arm
of
his
wife
and
moved
to
a
little
distance
presently
nathan
who
had
been
hunting
up
and
down
the
foyer
like
a
dog
looking
for
its
master
returned
to
the
spot
where
the
mask
had
addressed
him
seeing
on
his
face
an
expression
he
could
not
conceal
florine
placed
herself
like
a
post
in
front
of
him
and
said
imperiously
i
don
t
wish
you
to
leave
me
again
i
have
my
reasons
for
the
countess
then
at
the
instigation
of
her
husband
went
up
to
raoul
and
said
in
his
ear
marie
who
is
this
woman
leave
her
at
once
and
meet
me
at
the
foot
of
the
grand
in
this
difficult
extremity
raoul
dropped
florine
s
arm
and
though
she
caught
his
own
and
held
it
forcibly
she
was
obliged
after
a
moment
to
let
him
go
nathan
disappeared
into
the
crowd
what
did
i
tell
you
said
felix
in
florine
s
astonished
ears
offering
her
his
arm
come
she
said
whoever
you
are
come
have
you
a
carriage
here
for
all
answer
vandenesse
hurried
florine
away
followed
by
his
wife
a
few
moments
later
the
three
masks
driven
rapidly
by
the
vandenesse
coachman
reached
florine
s
house
as
soon
as
she
had
entered
her
own
apartments
the
actress
unmasked
madame
de
vandenesse
could
not
restrain
a
quiver
of
surprise
at
florine
s
beauty
as
she
stood
there
choking
with
anger
and
superb
in
her
wrath
and
jealousy
there
is
somewhere
in
these
rooms
said
vandenesse
a
portfolio
the
key
of
which
you
have
never
had
the
letters
are
probably
in
well
well
for
once
in
my
life
i
am
bewildered
you
know
something
that
i
have
been
uneasy
about
for
some
days
cried
florine
rushing
into
the
study
in
search
of
the
portfolio
vandenesse
saw
that
his
wife
was
turning
pale
beneath
her
mask
florine
s
apartment
revealed
more
about
the
intimacy
of
the
actress
and
nathan
than
any
ideal
mistress
would
wish
to
know
the
eye
of
a
woman
can
take
in
the
truth
of
such
things
in
a
second
and
the
countess
saw
vestiges
of
nathan
which
proved
to
her
the
certainty
of
what
vandenesse
had
said
florine
returned
with
the
portfolio
how
am
i
to
open
it
she
said
the
actress
rang
the
bell
and
sent
into
the
kitchen
for
the
cook
s
knife
when
it
came
she
brandished
it
in
the
air
crying
out
in
ironical
tones
with
this
they
cut
the
necks
of
the
words
which
made
the
countess
shiver
explained
to
her
even
better
than
her
husband
had
done
the
night
before
the
depths
of
the
abyss
into
which
she
had
so
nearly
fallen
what
a
fool
i
am
said
florine
his
razor
will
do
she
fetched
one
of
nathan
s
razors
from
his
and
slit
the
leather
cover
of
the
portfolio
through
which
marie
s
letters
dropped
florine
snatched
one
up
and
looked
it
over
yes
she
must
be
a
woman
it
looks
to
me
as
if
there
were
no
mistakes
in
spelling
the
count
gathered
up
the
letters
hastily
and
gave
them
to
his
wife
who
took
them
to
a
table
as
if
to
see
that
they
were
all
there
now
said
vandenesse
to
florine
will
you
let
me
have
those
letters
for
these
showing
her
five
of
ten
thousand
francs
each
they
ll
replace
the
sums
you
have
paid
for
ah
cried
florine
didn
t
i
kill
myself
body
and
soul
in
the
provinces
to
get
him
money
i
who
d
have
cut
my
hand
off
to
serve
him
but
that
s
men
damn
your
soul
for
them
and
they
ll
march
over
you
he
shall
pay
me
for
this
madame
de
vandenesse
was
disappearing
with
the
letters
hi
stop
stop
my
fine
mask
cried
florine
leave
me
one
to
confound
him
not
possible
said
vandenesse
why
not
that
mask
is
your
but
you
needn
t
fear
her
well
she
might
have
had
the
grace
to
say
thank
you
cried
florine
but
you
have
the
fifty
thousand
francs
instead
said
vandenesse
bowing
to
her
it
is
extremely
rare
for
young
men
when
driven
to
suicide
to
attempt
it
a
second
time
if
the
first
fails
when
it
doesn
t
cure
life
it
cures
all
desire
for
voluntary
death
raoul
felt
no
disposition
to
try
it
again
when
he
found
himself
in
a
more
painful
position
than
that
from
which
he
had
just
been
rescued
he
tried
to
see
the
countess
and
explain
to
her
the
nature
of
his
love
which
now
shone
more
vividly
in
his
soul
than
ever
but
the
first
time
they
met
in
society
madame
de
vandenesse
gave
him
that
fixed
and
contemptuous
look
which
at
once
and
forever
puts
an
impassable
gulf
between
a
man
and
a
woman
in
spite
of
his
natural
assurance
nathan
never
dared
during
the
rest
of
the
winter
either
to
speak
to
the
countess
or
even
approach
her
but
he
opened
his
heart
to
blondet
to
him
he
talked
of
his
laura
and
his
beatrice
apropos
of
madame
de
vandenesse
he
even
made
a
paraphrase
of
the
following
beautiful
passage
from
the
pen
of
theophile
gautier
one
of
the
most
remarkable
poets
of
our
day
ideala
flower
of
heaven
s
own
blue
with
heart
of
gold
whose
fibrous
roots
softer
a
thousandfold
than
fairy
tresses
strike
to
our
souls
and
drink
their
purest
essence
flower
most
sweet
and
bitter
thou
canst
not
be
torn
away
without
the
heart
s
blood
flowing
without
thy
bruised
stems
sweating
with
scarlet
tears
ah
cursed
flower
why
didst
thou
grow
within
my
soul
my
dear
fellow
said
blondet
you
are
raving
i
ll
grant
it
was
a
pretty
flower
but
it
wasn
t
a
bit
ideal
and
instead
of
singing
like
a
blind
man
before
an
empty
niche
you
had
much
better
wash
your
hands
and
make
submission
to
the
powers
you
are
too
much
of
an
artist
ever
to
be
a
good
politician
you
have
been
fooled
by
men
of
not
your
value
think
about
being
fooled
again
but
marie
can
not
prevent
my
loving
her
said
nathan
she
shall
be
my
beatrice
my
good
raoul
was
a
little
girl
twelve
years
of
age
when
dante
last
saw
her
otherwise
she
would
not
have
been
beatrice
to
make
a
divinity
it
won
t
do
to
see
her
one
day
wrapped
in
a
mantle
and
the
next
with
a
low
dress
and
the
third
on
the
boulevard
cheapening
toys
for
her
last
baby
when
a
man
has
florine
who
is
in
turn
duchess

i
don
t
see
why
he
should
go
rambling
after
fashionable
du
tillet
to
use
a
bourse
term
nathan
who
for
lack
of
money
gave
up
his
place
on
the
newspaper
and
the
celebrated
man
received
but
five
votes
in
the
electoral
college
where
the
banker
was
elected
when
after
a
long
and
happy
journey
in
italy
the
comtesse
de
vandenesse
returned
to
paris
late
in
the
following
winter
all
her
husband
s
predictions
about
nathan
were
justified
he
had
taken
blondet
s
advice
and
negotiated
with
the
government
which
employed
his
pen
his
personal
affairs
were
in
such
disorder
that
one
day
on
the
marie
saw
her
former
adorer
on
foot
in
shabby
clothes
giving
his
arm
to
florine
when
a
man
becomes
indifferent
to
the
heart
of
a
woman
who
has
once
loved
him
he
often
seems
to
her
very
ugly
even
horrible
especially
when
he
resembles
nathan
madame
de
vandenesse
had
a
sense
of
personal
humiliation
in
the
thought
that
she
had
once
cared
for
him
if
she
had
not
already
been
cured
of
all
passion
the
contrast
then
presented
by
the
count
to
this
man
grown
less
and
less
worthy
of
public
favor
would
have
sufficed
her
the
ambitious
nathan
rich
in
ink
and
poor
in
will
has
ended
by
capitulating
entirely
and
has
settled
down
into
a
sinecure
like
any
other
commonplace
man
after
lending
his
pen
to
all
disorganizing
efforts
he
now
lives
in
peace
under
the
protecting
shade
of
a
ministerial
organ
the
cross
of
the
legion
of
honor
formerly
the
fruitful
text
of
his
satire
adorns
his
peace
at
any
price
ridicule
of
which
was
the
of
his
revolutionary
editorship
is
now
the
topic
of
his
laudatory
articles
heredity
attacked
by
him
in
phrases
he
now
defends
with
solid
arguments
this
illogical
conduct
has
its
origin
and
its
explanation
in
the
change
of
front
performed
by
many
