v
preface
the
north
american
indian
has
so
long
been
an
object
of
the
deepest
interest
that
the
neglect
of
his
picturesque
and
original
mythologies
and
the
tales
to
which
they
have
given
rise
is
difficult
of
comprehension
in
boyhood
we
are
wont
to
regard
him
as
an
instrument
specially
designed
for
the
execution
of
tumultuous
incident
wherewith
fiction
may
be
manufactured
in
manhood
we
are
too
apt
to
consider
him
as
only
fit
to
be
put
aside
with
the
matter
of
faery
and
such
evanescent
stuff
and
relegated
to
the
limbo
of
imagination
satiated
with
his
constant
recurrence
in
the
tales
of
our
youth
we
are
perhaps
but
too
ready
to
hearken
credulously
to
accounts
which
picture
him
as
a
disreputable
vagabond
getting
a
precarious
living
by
petty
theft
or
the
manufacture
of
bead
ornaments
it
is
indeed
surprising
how
vague
a
picture
the
north
american
indian
presents
to
the
minds
of
most
people
in
europe
when
all
that
recent
anthropological
research
has
done
on
the
subject
is
taken
into
account
as
a
matter
of
fact
few
books
have
been
published
in
england
which
furnish
more
than
the
scantiest
details
concerning
the
red
race
and
these
are
in
general
scarce
and
when
obtained
of
doubtful
scientific
value
the
primary
object
of
this
volume
is
to
furnish
the
reader
with
a
general
view
of
the
mythologies
of
the
red
man
of
north
america
accompanied
by
such
historical
and
ethnological
information
as
will
assist
him
in
gauging
the
real
conditions
under
which
this
most
interesting
section
of
humanity
existed
the
basic
difference
between
the
indian
and
european
mental
outlook
is
insisted
upon
because
it
is
felt
that
no
proper
comprehension
of
american
indian
myth
or
vi
conditions
of
life
can
be
attained
when
such
a
distinction
is
not
recognized
and
allowed
for
the
difference
between
the
mundane
and
spiritual
of
the
red
man
and
that
of
the
european
is
as
vast
as
that
which
separates
the
conceptions
and
philosophies
of
the
east
and
west
nevertheless
we
shall
find
in
the
north
american
mythologies
much
that
enters
into
the
composition
of
the
immortal
tales
of
the
older
religions
of
the
eastern
hemisphere
all
myth
asiatic
european
or
american
springs
from
similar
natural
conceptions
and
if
we
discover
in
american
mythology
peculiarities
which
we
do
not
observe
in
the
systems
of
greece
rome
or
egypt
we
may
be
certain
that
these
arise
from
circumstances
of
environment
and
racial
habit
as
modified
by
climate
and
kindred
conditions
alone
in
the
last
thirty
years
much
has
been
accomplished
in
placing
the
study
of
the
american
aborigines
on
a
sounder
basis
the
older
school
of
ethnologists
were
for
the
most
part
obsessed
with
the
wildest
ideas
concerning
the
origin
of
the
indians
and
many
of
them
believed
the
red
man
to
be
the
degenerate
descendant
of
the
lost
ten
tribes
of
israel
or
of
early
phoenician
adventurers
but
these
had
perforce
to
give
way
to
a
new
school
of
students
well
equipped
with
scientific
knowledge
whose
labours
under
the
admirable
direction
of
the
united
states
bureau
of
ethnology
have
borne
rich
fruit
many
treatises
of
the
utmost
value
on
the
ethnology
mythology
and
tribal
customs
of
the
north
american
indians
have
been
issued
by
this
conscientious
and
enterprising
state
department
these
are
written
by
men
who
possess
knowledge
of
indian
life
and
languages
many
of
whom
have
faced
great
privations
and
hardships
in
order
to
collect
the
material
they
have
published
the
series
is
indeed
a
monument
to
that
nobler
type
of
heroism
which
science
vii
can
kindle
in
the
breast
of
the
student
and
the
direct
unembellished
verbiage
of
these
volumes
conceals
many
a
which
for
quiet
unassuming
bravery
and
contempt
for
danger
will
match
anything
in
the
records
of
research
and
human
endurance

chapter
i
divisions
customs
and
history
of
the
race
the
first
indians
in
europe
almost
immediately
upon
the
discovery
of
the
new
world
its
inhabitants
became
a
source
of
the
greatest
interest
to
all
ranks
and
classes
among
the
people
of
europe
that
this
should
have
been
so
is
not
a
little
surprising
when
we
remember
the
ignorance
which
prevailed
regarding
the
discovery
of
the
new
hemisphere
and
that
in
the
popular
imagination
the
people
of
the
lands
were
considered
to
be
inhabitants
of
those
eastern
countries
which
european
navigation
had
striven
so
long
and
so
fruitlessly
to
reach
the
very
name
bestowed
upon
the
men
from
the
islands
of
the
far
western
ocean
proves
the
nature
and
falsity
of
the
new
conditions
which
through
the
discovery
of
columbus
were
imposed
upon
the
science
of
geography
why
all
this
intense
and
vivid
interest
in
the
strange
beings
whom
the
genoese
commander
carried
back
with
him
as
specimens
of
the
population
of
the
isles
the
spaniards
were
accustomed
to
the
presence
and
sight
of
orientals
they
had
for
centuries
dwelt
side
by
side
with
a
nation
of
eastern
speech
and
origin
and
the
things
of
the
east
held
little
of
novelty
for
them
is
it
not
possible
that
the
people
by
reason
of
some
natural
motive
difficult
of
comprehension
did
not
credit
in
their
hearts
the
scientific
conclusions
of
the
day
something
deeper
and
more
primitive
than
science
was
at
work
in
their
minds
and
some
profound
human
instinct
told
them
that
the
dusky
and
befeathered
folk
they
beheld
in
the
triumphal
procession
of
the
discoverer
were
not
the
inhabitants
of
an
orient
with
which
they
were
more
or
less
familiar
but
erstwhile
dwellers
in
a
mystic
continent
which
had
been
isolated
from
the
rest
of
mankind
for
countless
centuries
there
are
not
wanting
circumstances
which
go
far
to
prove
that
instinct
brushing
aside
the
conclusions
of
science
felt
that
it
had
rightly
come
upon
the
truth
the
motto
on
the
arms
granted
to
columbus
is
eloquent
of
the
popular
feeling
when
it
states
to
castile
and
leon
columbus
gave
a
new
world
and
the
news
was
greeted
in
london
with
the
pronouncement
that
it
seemed
a
thing
more
divine
than
human
a
conclusion
which
could
scarcely
have
been
arrived
at
if
it
was
considered
that
the
reaching
of
the
farthest
orient
point
alone
had
been
achieved
the
primitive
and
barbarous
appearance
of
the
indians
in
the
train
of
columbus
deeply
impressed
the
people
of
spain
the
savage
had
before
this
event
been
merely
a
legendary
and
heraldic
animal
like
the
griffin
and
the
phoenix
in
the
person
of
the
indian
he
was
presented
for
the
first
time
to
the
astonished
gaze
of
a
european
people
who
were
quick
to
distinguish
the
differences
in
feature
and
general
appearance
between
the
red
man
and
the
civilized
oriental
although
his
resemblance
to
the
tartar
race
was
insisted
upon
by
some
early
writers
popular
interest
instead
of
abating
grew
greater
and
with
each
american
discovery
the
became
the
subject
of
renewed
controversy
works
on
the
origin
and
customs
of
the
american
aborigines
of
ponderous
erudition
but
doubtful
conclusions
were
eagerly
perused
and
discussed
these
were
not
any
more
extravagant
however
than
many
theories
propounded
at
a
much
later
date
in
the
early
nineteenth
century
a
school
of
enthusiastic
antiquaries
perhaps
the
most
distinguished
of
whom
was
lord
kingsborough
determined
upon
proving
the
identity
of
the
american
aborigines
with
the
lost
ten
tribes
of
israel
and
brought
to
bear
upon
the
subject
a
perfect
battery
of
erudition
of
the
most
extraordinary
kind
his
great
work
on
the
subject
antiquities
of
absorbed
a
fortune
of
some
fifty
thousand
pounds
by
its
publication
the
most
absurd
philological
conclusions
were
arrived
at
in
the
course
of
these
researches
examples
of
which
it
would
but
weary
the
reader
to
peruse
only
a
shade
less
ridiculous
were
the
deductions
drawn
from
indian
customs
where
these
bore
a
certain
surface
resemblance
to
hebrew
rite
or
priestly
usage
indians
as
jews
as
an
example
of
this
species
of
argument
it
will
be
sufficient
to
quote
the
following
passage
from
a
work
published
in
migration
from
by
captain
palmer
london
the
indian
wears
a
breastplate
made
of
a
white
and
around
his
head
either
a
wreath
of
swan
feathers
or
a
long
piece
of
swan
skin
doubled
so
as
to
show
only
the
snowy
feathers
on
each
side
these
remind
us
of
the
breastplate
and
mitre
of
the
jewish
they
have
also
a
magic
stone
which
is
transparent
and
which
the
consult
it
is
most
jealously
guarded
even
from
their
own
people
and
adair
could
never
procure
one
is
this
an
imitation
of
the
urim
and
thummim
again
they
have
a
feast
of
which
they
celebrate
with
songs
and
dances
repeating
with
great
earnestness
and
fervour
they
dance
in
three
circles
round
the
fire
that
cooks
these
fruits
on
a
kind
of
altar
shouting
the
praises
of
jehovah
these
words
are
only
used
in
their
religious
festivals
to
what
tribe
the
writer
alludes
is
not
manifest
from
the
context
indians
an
ethnological
connexion
has
been
traced
for
the
red
man
of
north
america
with
equal
parade
of
erudition
to
phoenicians
hittites
and
south
sea
islanders
but
one
of
the
most
amusing
of
these
theories
is
that
which
attempts
to
substantiate
his
with
the
inhabitants
of
wales
the
argument
in
favour
of
this
theory
is
so
quaint
and
is
such
a
capital
example
of
the
kind
of
learning
under
which
american
ethnology
has
groaned
for
generations
that
it
may
be
briefly
examined
in
the
author
of
mexico
and
a
short
account
is
given
of
the
legend
of
madoc
son
of
owen
gwyneth
a
welsh
prince
who
quitted
his
country
in
disgust
at
the
manner
in
which
his
brothers
had
partitioned
their
father
territories
sailing
due
west
with
several
vessels
he
arrived
says
sir
thomas
herbert
in
his
at
the
gulf
of
mexico
not
far
from
florida
in
the
year
after
settling
there
he
returned
to
wales
for
reinforcements
and
once
more
fared
toward
the
dim
west
never
to
be
heard
of
more
but
says
the
chronicler
though
the
cambrian
issue
in
the
new
found
world
may
seeme
extinct
the
language
to
this
day
used
among
these
canibals
together
with
their
adoring
the
crosse
using
beades
reliques
of
holy
men
and
some
other
noted
in
them
of
acusano
and
other
places
points
at
our
madoc
former
being
there
the
cambrians
continued
sir
thomas
left
in
their
american
colony
many
names
of
birds
rivers
rocks
beasts
and
the
like
some
of
which
words
are
these
signifying
in
the
cambrian
speech
to
give
eare
unto
or
hearken
with
us
a
white
head
refered
by
the
mexicans
to
a
bird
and
rockes
complying
with
that
idiom
some
promontories
had
like
denominations
called
so
by
the
people
to
this
day
tho
estranged
and
concealed
by
the
spaniard
such
are
the
isles
the
cape
of
or
the
floud
or
white
water
bread
mother
father
water
time
or
a
cow
a
heathcocke
a
fox
an
egge
a
quill
a
nose
heaven
and
the
like
then
used
by
which
in
my
conceit
none
save
detracting
opinionatists
can
justly
oppose
such
worthy
testimonies
and
proofes
of
what
i
wish
were
generally
allowed
of
antiquity
of
man
in
america
to
turn
to
more
substantial
conclusions
concerning
the
racial
affinities
of
the
red
man
we
find
that
it
is
only
within
very
recent
times
that
anything
like
a
reasoned
scientific
argument
has
been
arrived
at
founding
upon
recently
acquired
geological
anthropological
and
linguistic
knowledge
inquirers
into
the
deeper
realms
of
american
ethnology
have
solved
the
question
of
how
the
western
hemisphere
was
peopled
and
the
arguments
they
adduce
are
so
convincing
in
their
nature
as
to
leave
no
doubt
in
the
minds
of
unbiased
persons
it
is
now
admitted
that
the
presence
of
man
in
the
old
world
dates
from
an
epoch
so
far
distant
as
to
be
calculated
only
by
reference
to
geological
periods
of
which
we
know
the
succession
but
not
the
duration
and
research
has
proved
that
the
same
holds
good
of
the
western
hemisphere
although
man
undoubtedly
found
his
way
from
the
old
world
to
the
new
the
period
at
which
he
did
so
is
so
remote
that
for
all
practical
purposes
he
may
be
said
to
have
peopled
both
hemispheres
simultaneously
indeed
his
relative
antiquity
in
each
has
no
bearing
on
the
history
of
his
advancement
it
is
known
that
the
american
continent
offers
no
example
of
the
highly
organized
primates
for
example
the
larger
apes
in
which
the
old
world
abounds
save
man
himself
and
this
circumstance
is
sufficient
to
prove
that
the
human
species
must
have
reached
america
as
strangers
had
man
been
native
to
the
new
world
there
would
have
been
found
side
by
side
with
him
either
existing
or
fossil
representatives
of
the
greater
apes
and
other
anthropoid
animals
which
illustrate
his
pedigree
in
the
old
world
the
great
miocene
bridge
again
many
careful
observers
have
noticed
the
striking
resemblance
between
the
natives
of
america
and
northern
asia
at
bering
strait
the
old
world
and
the
new
are
separated
by
a
narrow
only
and
an
elevation
of
the
of
less
than
two
hundred
feet
would
provide
a
at
least
thirty
miles
in
breadth
between

it
is
a
geological
fact
that
bering
strait
has
been
formed
since
the
tertiary
period
and
that
such
a

existed
to
which
american
geologists
have
given
the

of

it
is
believed

crossed
from

to
america
and
its
subsequent
disappearance
confined
him
to
the
western
hemisphere
american
man
in
glacial
times
that
this
migration
occurred
before
the
glacial
period
is
proved
by
the
circumstance
that
chipped
flints
and
other
implements
have
been
discovered
in
at
points
in
ohio
indiana
and
minnesota
to
which
it
is
known
that
the
southern
margin
of
the

proves
that
man
was
driven
southward
by
the
advancing
ice
as
were
several
old
world
animal
species
which
had
migrated
to
america
however
it
is
difficult
in
many
cases
to
accept
what
may
seem
to
be
evidence
of
the
presence
of
prehistoric
man
in
north
america
with
any
degree
of
confidence
and
it
will
be
well
to
confine
ourselves
to
the
most
authentic
instances
in
the
loess
of
the
mississippi
at
natchez
dickson
found
side
by
side
with
the
remains
of
the
mylodon
and
megalonyx
human
bones
blackened
by
time
but
sir
charles
lyell
pointed
out
that
these
remains
might
have
been
carried
by
the
action
of
water
from
the
numerous
indian
places
of
burial
in
the
neighbourhood
in
new
orleans
while
trenches
were
being
dug
for
a
skeleton
was
discovered
sixteen
feet
from

the
skull
of
which
was
embedded
beneath
a
gigantic
but
the
deposit
in
which
the
remains
were
found
was
subsequently
stated
to
be
of
recent
origin
a
reed

was
discovered
at
petit
anse
louisiana
at
a
depth
of
from
fifteen
to
twenty
feet
among

near
the
tusks

of
an
elephant
in

koch
discovered
the

sunk
in
the

of

and
borne
down
by
its
own
ponderous
bulk
had
been
unable
to
right

espied
by
the
hunters
of
that
dim
era
it
had
been
attacked
by
them
and
the
signs
of
their
onset
flint
and
pieces
of
rock
were
found
mingled
with
its
bones
unable
to
dispatch
it
with
their
comparatively
puny
weapons
they
had
built
great
fires
round
it
the
of
which
remain
to
the
height
of
six
feet
and
by
this
means
they
had
presumably
succeeded
in
suffocating
it
in
iowa
and
nebraska
aughey
found
many
evidences
of
the
presence
of
early
man
in
stone
weapons
mingled
with
the
bones
of
the
mastodon
in
california
colorado
and
wyoming
scores
of
stone
mortars
and
have
been
discovered
in
deposits
which
show
no
sign
of
displacement
traces
of
ancient
mining
operations
are
also
met
with
in
california
and
the

superior
district
the
skeletons
of
the
primitive
miners
being
found
stone
hammer
in
hand
beneath
the
masses
of
rock
which
buried
them
in
their
fall
as
the
object
of
these
searchers
was
evidently
metal
of
some
description
it
may
reasonably
be
inferred
that
the
remains
are
of
comparatively
late
date
the
calaveras
skull
in
professor
whitney
discovered
the
famous
skull
at
a
depth
of
about
a
hundred
and
thirty
feet
in
a
bed
of
auriferous
gravel
on
the
western
slope
of
the
sierra
nevada
california
the
skull
rested
on
a
bed
of
lava
and
was
covered
by
several
layers
of
lava
and
volcanic
deposit
many
other
remains
were
found
in
similar
geological
positions
and
this
was
thought
to
prove
that
the
calaveras
skull
was
not
an
isolated
instance
of
the
presence
of
man
in
america
in
tertiary
times
the
skull
resembles
the
eskimo
type
and
chemical
analysis
discovered
the
presence
of
organic
matter
these
circumstances
led
to
the
conclusion
that
the
great
age
claimed
by
whitney
for
the
relic
was
by
no
means
proved
and
this
view
was
strengthened
by
the
knowledge
that
displacements
of
the
deposits
in
which
it
had
been
discovered
had
frequently
been
caused
by
volcanic
agency

to
have
been

abandoned
by

toward
the
close
of

that

warrant
definite
conclusions

is
seriously
questioned
by

in

whatever
doubt
attaches
to
the
presence
of
man
in
america
during
the
tertiary
period
a
doubt
which
is
not
shared
by
most
american
archæologists
there
is
none
regarding
his
occupation
of
the
entire
continent
in
times
less
remote
yet
far
distant
from
the
dawn
of
the
earliest
historical
records
of
asia
or
europe
in
caves
and
or
over
the
entire
length
and
breadth
of
the
american
continent
numerous
evidences
of
the
presence
of
populous
centres
have
been
discovered
mingled
with
the
shells
of
molluscs
and
the
bones
of
extinct
animals
human
remains
weapons
and
implements
are
to
be
found
with
traces
of
fire
which
prove
that
the
men
of
those
early
days
had
risen
above
the
merely
animal
existence
led
by
the
to
american
soil
affinities
with
siberian
peoples
as
has
already
been
indicated
careful
observers
have
repeatedly
remarked
upon
the
strong
likeness
between
the
american
races
and
those
of
asia
this
likeness
is
not
only
physical
but
extends
to
custom
and
to
some
extent
to
religious
belief
the
and
medicine
customs
of
the
ostiaks
resemble
those
of
the
kolusches
even
to
the
smallest
details
and
the
myth
of
a
who
ascends
the
sky
from
a
lofty
tree
lowering
himself
again
to
earth
by
a
strip
of
leather
a
rope
of
grass
a
plait
of
hair
or
the
curling
wreath
of
smoke
from
a
hut
occurs
not
only
among
the
ugrian
tribes
but
among
the
dogrib
indians
such
myths
it
is
contended
though
insufficient
to
prove
common
descent
point
to
early
communications
between
these
distant
stocks
superstitious
usages
on
the
other
hand
it
is
argued
are
scarcely
likely
to
have
been
adopted
in
consequence
of
mere
intercourse
and
indicate
a
common
origin
thus
among
the
itelmians
of
kamchatka
it
is
forbidden
to
carry
a
burning
brand
otherwise
than
in
the
fingers
it
must
on
no
account
be
pierced
for
that
purpose
with
the
point
of
a
knife
a
similar
superstition
is
cherished
by
the
dakota
again
when
the
tribes
of
hudson
bay
slay
a
bear
they
daub
the
head
with
gay
colours
and
sing
around
it
hymns
having
a
religious
character
it
is
understood
to
symbolize
the
spirit
of
the
deceased
animal
a
similar
practice
it
is
said
prevails
throughout
siberia
and
is
met
with
among
the
gilyaks
of
the
amur
and
the
ainu
the
ostiaks
hang
the
skin
of
a
bear
on
a
tree
pay
it
the
profoundest
respect
and
address
it
while
imploring
pardon
of
the
spirit
of
the
animal
for
having
put
it
to
death
their
usual
oath
moreover
is
the
bear
as
the
polished
athenians
habitually
swore
the
dog
earthen
vessels
it
is
further
urged
were
manufactured
not
only
by
the
itelmians
but
by
the
aleutians
and
the
kolusches
of
the
new
world
whereas
the
assiniboins
settled
farther
to
the
southward
cooked
their
flesh
in
kettles
of

into
which
stones
were
cast

summarizing
the
investigations
of
peschel
and
tylor
the
evidence
of
american
languages
the
structure
of
the
aboriginal
languages
of
america
corroborates
the
conclusion
that
the
american
race
proceeded
from
one
instead
of
several
sources
and
that
it
is
an
ethnological
extension
of
asia
not
only
does
the
of
american
speech
closely
resemble
that
of
the
neighbouring
asiatic
races
in
the
possession
of
a
common
basis
of
phonesis
and
strenuity
but
the
rejection
of
labial
explodents
which
extends
from
northern
asia
through
the
speech
of
the
aleutian
islands
to
america
is
good
evidence
of
affinity
evidences
of
asiatic
intercourse
evidences
of
asiatic
intercourse
with
america
in
recent
and
historical
times
are
not
wanting
it
is
a
fact
that
the
russians
had
learned
from
the
native
siberians
of
the
whereabouts
of
america
long
before
the
discovery
of
the
contiguity
of
the
continents
by
bering
charlevoix
in
his
work
on
the
origin
of
the
indians
states
that
père
grellon
one
of
the
french
jesuit
fathers
encountered
a
huron
woman
on
the
plains
of
tartary
who
had
been
sold
from
tribe
to
tribe
until
she
had
passed
from
bering
strait
into
central
asia
slight
though
such
incidents
seem
it
is
by
means
of
them
that
important
truths
may
be
gleaned
if
one
individual
was
exchanged
in
this
manner
there
were
probably
many
similar
cases
illustration
on
the
lakes
later
migrations
there
are
theories
in
existence
worthy
of
respect
which
would
regard
the
north
american
indians
as
the
last
and
recent
wave
of
many
asiatic
migrations
to
american
soil
if
credence
can
be
extended
to
the
norse
sagas
which
describe
the
visits
of
scandinavian
voyagers
to
the
eastern
coasts
of
america
the
accounts
given
of
the
race
encountered
by
these
early
discoverers
by
no
means
tally
with
any
possible
description
of
the
red
man
the
viking
seafarers
nicknamed
the
american
natives
or
because
of
their
puny
appearance
and
the
account
which
they
gave
of
them
would
seem
to
class
them
as
a
folk
possessing
eskimo
affinities
many
remains
discovered
in
the
eastern
states
are
of
the
eskimo
type
and
when
one
combines
with
this
the
indian
traditions
of
a
great
migration
traditions
which
can
not
have
survived
for
many
generations
it
will
be
seen
that
the
exact
epoch
of
the
entrance
of
the
red
man
into
america
is
by
no
means
finally
settled
the
norsemen
in
america
as
the
visits
of
the
norsemen
to
america
during
the
tenth
century
have
been
alluded
to
perhaps
some
further
reference
to
this
absorbing
subject
may
be
made
as
it
is
undoubtedly
germane
to
the
question
of
the
identity
of
the
inhabitants
of
eastern
north
america
the
scandinavian
colonization
of
iceland
tempted
the
intrepid
viking
race
to
extend
their
voyages
into
still
more
northerly
waters
and
this
resulted
in
the
discovery
of
greenland
once
settled
upon
those
dreary
beaches
it
was
practically
inevitable
that
the
hardy
seamen
would
speedily
discover
american
soil
biarne
herjulfson
sailing
from
iceland
to
greenland
without
knowledge
of
the
waters
he
navigated
was
caught
in
dense
fog
and
shifting
wind
so
that
he
knew
not
in
what
direction
he
sailed
witless
methinks
is
our
laughed
the
stout
norseman
seeing
that
none
of
us
has
beheld
the
greenland
sea
holding
doggedly
on
however
the
adventurers
came
at
last
in
sight
of
land
but
this
was
no
country
of
lofty
ice
such
as
they
had
been
told
to
expect
a
land
of
gentle
undulations
covered
with
timber
met
their
eyes
bearing
away
they
came
to
another
land
like
the
first
the
wind
fell
and
the
sailors
proposed
to
disembark
but
biarne
refused
five
days
afterward
they
made
greenland
biarne
had
of
course
got
into
that
arctic
current
which
sets
southward
from
the
polar
circle
between
iceland
and

and
had
been
carried
to
the
coasts
of

leif
the
lucky
biarne
did
not
care
to
pursue
his
discoveries
but
at
the
court
of
eric
earl
of
norway
to
which
he
paid
a
visit
his
neglect
in
following
them
up
was
much
talked
about
all
greenland
too
was
agog
with
the
news
leif
surnamed
lucky
son
of
eric
the
red
the
first
colonizer
of
greenland
purchased
biarne
ship
and
hiring
a
crew
of
men
one
of
whom
was
a
german
named
tyrker
perhaps
tydsker
the
norse
for
set
sail
for
the
land
seen
by
biarne
he
soon
espied
it
and
cast
anchor
but
it
was
a
barren
place
so
they
called
it
or
of
flat
stones
and
leaving
it
sailed
southward
again
soon
they
came
to
another
country
which
they
called
markland
or
for
it
was
low
and
flat
and
well
covered
with
trees
these
shores
also
they
left
and
again
put
to
sea
the
land
of
wine
after
sailing
still
farther
south
they
came
to
a
strait
lying
between
an
island
and
a
promontory
here
they
landed
and
built
huts
the
air
was
warm
after
the
winds
of
greenland
and
when
the
day
was
shortest
the
sun
was
above
the
horizon
from
seven
in
the
morning
until
four
in
the
afternoon
they
divided
into
two
bands
to
explore
the
land
one
day
tyrker
the
german
was
missing
they
searched
for
him
and
found
him
at
no
great
distance
from
the
camp
in
a
state
of
much
excitement
for
he
had
discovered
vines
with
grapes
upon
them
a
boon
to
a
man
coming
from
a
land
of
vines
who
had
beheld
none
for
half
a
lifetime
they
loaded
the
ship
boat
with
the
grapes
and
felled
timber
to
freight
the
ship
and
in
the
spring
sailed
away
from
the
country
which
they
named
it
would
seem
that
the
name
was
applied
to
newfoundland
or
labrador
to
nova
scotia
and
to
new
england
and
that
leif
wintered
in
some
part
of
the
state
of
rhode
island
the
skrælingr
in
the
year
leif
brother
thorwald
sailed
to
the
new
land
in
biarne
ship
from
the
place
where
leif
had
landed
which
the
norsemen
named
booths
or
huts
he
explored
the
country
southward
and
northward
but
at
a
promontory
in
the
neighbourhood
of
boston
he
was
attacked
and
slain
by
the
skrælingr
who
inhabited
the
country
these
men
are
described
as
small
and
dwarfish
in
appearance
and
as
possessing
eskimo
characteristics
in
a
bold
attempt
was
made
to
colonize
the
country
from
greenland
three
ships
with
a
hundred
and
sixty
men
aboard
sailed
to
where
they
wintered
but
the
incessant
attacks
of
the
skrælingr
rendered
colonization
impossible
and
the
norsemen
took
their
departure
the
extinction
of
the
scandinavian
colonies
in
greenland
put
an
end
to
all
communication
with
america
but
the
last
voyage
from
greenland
to
american
shores
took
place
in
only
a
hundred
and
years
before
columbus
discovered
the
west
indian
islands
in
the
skrælingr
of
greenland
the
eskimo
attacked
and
destroyed
the
norse
settlements
there
and
carried
away
the
colonists
into
captivity
it
is
perhaps
the
descendants
of
these
norse
folk
who
dared
the
world
of
ice

northern
bank
of

about
sixty
miles
from

with

it
includes
mounds
placed
at
regular

from

and
forming
together
a
large

the
central
mound
represents
a
turtle
forty
feet
long
by
feet
wide
and
twelve
feet
high
it
is
almost
entirely
constructed
of
yellow
clay
which
is
not
found
in
the
district
and
therefore
must
have
been
brought
from
a
distance
two
mounds
of
red
earth
of
triangular
form
flank
it
north
and
south
and
each
of
these
is
feet
long
by
about
six
feet
wide
at
one
end
the
opposite
end
tapering
off
until
it
scarcely
rises

at

on

twelve

consist
of
white
sand
mixed
with
numerous
fragments

covered
with
a
layer

clay
and
a
second
one
of
vegetable
mould
lastly
thirteen
smaller
mounds
fill
in
the
intervals
in
the
group
conant
gives
an
explanation
of
the
whole
group
as
follows
the
principal
tomb
would
be
the
last
home
of
a
great
chief
the
black
tortoise
the
four
mounds
which
form
the
corners
of
the
quadrangle
were
also
erected
as
a
sign
of
the
mourning
of
the
tribe
the
secondary
mounds
are
the
tombs
of
other
chiefs
and
the
little
mounds
erected
in
the
north
and
south
corresponded
with
the
number
of
bodies
which
had
been
deposited
in
them
the
two
pointed
mounds
indicate
that
the
black
tortoise
was
the
last
of
his
race
and
the
two
large
mounds
the
importance
of
that
race
and
the
dignity
which
had
belonged
to
it
lastly
the
two
mounds
to
the
right
and
left
of
the
royal
tomb
mark
the
of
the
prophets
or
soothsayers
who
even
to
our
own
day
play
a
great
part
among
the
indian
tribes
the
fragments
of
mica
found
in
their
tombs
would
indicate
their
rank
of
vanished
who
were
the
it
is
not
probable
that
the
reader
will
agree
with
all
the
conclusions
drawn
in
the
paragraph
quoted
above
which
would
claim
for
these
structures
a
hieroglyphic
as
well
as
a
sepulchral
significance
but
such
speculations
can
not
destroy
the
inherent
interest
of
the
subject
however
much
they
may
irritate
those
who
desire
to
arrive
at
logical
conclusions
concerning
it
who
then
were
the
folk
who
raised
the
mounds
of
ohio
and
the
mississippi
and
spread
their
culture
from
the
gulf
states
region
to
the
great
lakes
needless
to
say
the
of
the
last
century
stoutly
maintained
that
they
were
strangers
from
over
the
sea
and
who
had
forsaken
the
cities
of
egypt
persia
and
phoenicia
and
had
settled
in
the
west
in
order
to
pursue
their
strange
religions
undisturbed
but
such
a
view
by
no
means
commends
itself
to
modern
science
which
sees
in
the
architects
of
these
mounds
and
pyramids
the
ancestors
of
the
present
aborigines
of
north
america
many
of
the
objects
discovered
in
the
mounds
are
of
european
manufacture
or
prove
contact
with
europeans
which
shows
that
the
structures
containing
them
are
of
comparatively
modern
origin
the
articles
discovered
and
the
character
of
the
various
monuments
indicate
a
culture
stage
similar
to
that
noted
among
the
more
advanced
tribes
inhabiting
the
regions
where
the
mounds
occur
at
the
period
of
the
advent
of
the
whites
moreover
the
statements
of
early
writers
on
these
regions
such
as
the
members
of
de
soto
expedition
prove
beyond
question
that
some
of
the
structures
were
erected
by
the
indians
in
times
it
is
known
that
some
of
the
tribes
inhabiting
the
gulf
states
when
de
soto
passed
through
their
territory
in
as
the
yuchi
creeks
chickasaw
and
natchez
were
still
using
and
probably
constructing
mounds
and
that
the
quapaw
of
arkansas
were
also
using
them
there
is
also
documentary
evidence
that
the
tribe
still
used
mounds
at
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century
when
a
chief
house
is
described
as
being
built
on
one
there
is
also
sufficient
evidence
to
justify
the
conclusion
that
the
cherokee
and
shawnee
were
according

fletcher

winnebago

nothing
has
been
found
in

antiquity

the
present
tendency
among

is
to
assign
to
them
a
comparatively
recent

may
be

to

will
be
well
at

it
is
composed

so

appear
to
have
adopted
many
of
the
customs

of
such
tribes
as
they
were
brought
into

with
and
do
not
seem
to
have
had
any
impetus
to
frame
a
culture
of
their
own
their
tribes
had
little
cohesion

were

into

for
the
most
part
precarious

it
consisted
almost
entirely
of

was
with

they
borrowed
from
the

tippecanoe
in
the
spirit
of
the
indians
was
broken
and
the
year
saw
the
commencement
of
a
series
of
indian
migrations
westward
and
a
wholesale
cession
of
indian
territory
which
continued
over
a
period
of
about
thirty
years
a
sedentary
people
the
algonquins
had
been
for
generations
the
victims
of
the
iroquois
confederacy
and
only
when
the
french
had
guaranteed
them
immunity
from
the
attacks
of
their
hereditary
enemies
did
they
set
their
faces
to
the
east
once
more
to
court
repulse
a
second
time
at
the
hands
of
the
english
settlers
tall
and
finely
proportioned
the
algonquins
were
mainly
a
sedentary
and
agricultural
people
growing
maize
and
wild
rice
for
their
staple
foods
indeed
more
than
once
were
the
colonists
of
new
england
saved
from
famine
by
these
industrious
folk
in
wayne
army
found
a
continuous
plantation
along
the
entire
length
of
the
maumee
river
from
fort
wayne
to
lake
erie
and
such
evidence
entirely
shatters
the
popular
fallacy
that
the
indian
race
were
altogether
lacking
in
the
virtues
of
industry
and
domesticity
they
employed
and
ashes
as
fertilizers
and
made
use
of
spades
and
hoes
and
it
was
the
algonquins
who
first
instilled
in
the
white
settlers
the
knowledge
of
how
to
prepare
those
succulent
dainties
for
which
new
england
is
famous
hominy
succotash
and
they
possessed
the
art
of
tanning
deerskin
to
a
delicate
softness
which
rendered
it
a
luxurious
and
delightful
raiment
and
like
the
aztecs
they
manufactured
mantles
of
they
had
also
elaborated
a
system
of
in
short
they
were
the
most
intelligent
and
advanced
of
the
eastern
tribes
and
had
their
civilization
been
permitted
to
proceed
unhindered
by
white
aggression
and
the
recurring
inroads
of
their
hereditary
enemies
the
iroquois
it
would
probably
have
evolved
into
something
resembling
that
of
the
nahua
of
mexico
without
perhaps
exhibiting
the
sanguinary
fanaticism
of
that
people
the
great
weakness
of
the
algonquian
stock
was
a
lack
of
solidity
of
character
which
prevented
them
from
achieving
a
degree
of
tribal
organization
and
cohesion
sufficient
to
enable
them
to
withstand
their
foes

to
a
frenzy
of
childish
indignation
it
was
a
native
saying
that
one
pays
for

when
an
indian
was
slain
his
nearest
considered
that
he
had
consummated
a
righteous
revenge
by
murdering
the

accused

probably
the

veneer
of

were
only
a
little
less
ignorant
than

as
vindictively
cruel
as
the
barbarians
with

the
indian
regarded
the
colonist
as
an
interloper
who
had
come
to
despoil
him
of
the
land
of
his
fathers
while
the
virginian
puritan
considered
himself
the
salt
of

and
the

as
a
heathen

sent

the

of

were
at

period
almost
overwhelmed

complained
bitterly
that
those

who
had
been
converted
to

were
withdrawn
from

control
and
he
made
vigorous
war
on

many
of

in
ashes

victory
was
with
the

at
the
battle

men
were
scattered
captain
benjamin
church
it
was
who
first
taught
the

to
fight
the

in

own
manner
he
moved
as
stealthily
as
the
savages
themselves
and
to
avoid
an
alarm
never
allowed
an
indian
to
be
shot
who
could
be
reached
with

the
indians
who
were
captured
were
sold
into
slavery
in
the
west

where
the
hard
labour
and
change
of
climate
were
usually
instrumental
in
speedily
putting
an
end
to
their
servitude
step
by
step
the
red
man
was
driven
westward
until
he
vanished
from
the
vicinity
of
the
earlier
settlements
altogether
from
that
period
the
history
of
his
conflicts
with
the
whites
is
bound
up
with
the
records
of
their
western
extension
the
reservations
the
necessity
of
bringing
the
indian
tribes
under
the
complete
control
of
the
united
states
government
and
confining
them
to
definite
limits
for
the
better
preservation
of
order
was
responsible
for
the
policy
of
placing
them
on
tracts
of
territory
of
their
own
called
this
step
led
the
natives
to
realize
the
benefits
of
a
settled
existence
and
to
depend
on
their
own
industry
for
a
livelihood
rather
than
upon
the
more
precarious
products
of
the
chase
an
act
of
congress
was
passed
in
which
put
a
period
to
the
existence
of
the
indian
tribes
as
separate
communities
and
permitted
all
tribal
lands
and
reservations
to
be
so
divided
that
each
individual
member
of
a
tribe
might
possess
a
separate
holding
many
of
these
holdings
are
of
considerable
value
and
the
possessors
are
by
no
means
poorly
endowed
with
this
world
goods
on
the
whole
the
policy
of
the
united
states
toward
the
indians
has
been
dictated
by
justice
and
humanity
but
instances
have
not
been
wanting
in
which
arid
lands
have
been
foisted
upon
the
indians
and
the
pressure
of
white
settlers
has
frequently
forced
the
government
to
dispossess
the
red
man
of
the
land
that
had
originally
been
granted
to
him
the
story
of
pocahontas
many
romantic
stories
are
told
concerning
the
relations
of
the
early
white
settlers
with
the
indians
among
the
most
interesting
is
that
of
pocahontas
the
daughter
of
the
renowned
indian
chief
powhatan
the
erstwhile
implacable
enemy
of
the
whites
pocahontas
who
as
a
child
had
often
played
with
the
young
colonists
was
visiting
a
certain
chief
named
japazaws
when
an
english
captain
named
argall
bribed
him
with
a
copper
kettle
to
betray
her
into
his
hands
argall
took
her
a
captive
to
jamestown
here
a
white
man
by
the
name
of
john
rolfe
married
her
after
she
had
received
christian
baptism
this
marriage
brought
about
a
peace
between
powhatan
and
the
english
settlers
in
virginia
when
dale
went
back
to
england
in
he
took
with
him
some
of
the
indians
pocahontas
who
was
now
called
lady
rebecca
and
her
husband
accompanied
the
party
pocahontas
was
called
a
princess
in
england
and
received
much
attention
but
when
about
to
return
to
the
colony
she
died
leaving
a
little
son
the
quaint
version
of
captain
nathaniel
powell
which
retains
all
the
known
facts
of
pocahontas
story
states
that
during
this
time
the
lady
rebecca
pocahontas
daughter
to
powhatan
by
the
diligent
care
of
master
john
rolfe
her
husband
and
his
friends
was
taught
to
speak
such
english
as
might
well
be
understood
well
instructed
in
christianity
and
was
become
very
formal
and
civil
after
our
english
manner
she
had
also
by
him
a
child
which
she
loved
most
dearly
and
the
treasurer
and
company
took
order
both
for
the
maintenance
of
her
and
it
besides
there
were
divers
persons
of
great
rank
and
quality
had
been
kind
to
her
and
before
she
arrived
at
london
captain
smith
to
deserve
her
former
courtesies
made
her
qualities
known
to
the
most
excellent
majesty
and
her
court
and
wrote
a
little
book
to
this
effect
to
the
queen
an
abstract
whereof
follows
the
most
high
and
virtuous
princess

anne
of

love
i
bear
my

my

hath
so
oft
emboldened
me
in
the
worst
of
extreme
dangers
that
now
honesty
doth
constrain
me
to
presume
thus
far
beyond
myself
to
present
your
majesty
this
short
discourse
if
ingratitude
be
a
deadly
poison
to
all
honest
virtues
i
must
be
guilty
of
that
crime
if
i
should
omit
any
means
to
be
thankful
it
is
some
ten
years
ago
being
in
virginia
and
taken
prisoner
by
the
power
of
powhatan
their
chief
king
i
received
from
this
great
savage
exceeding
great
courtesy
especially
from
his
son
nantaquaus
the
most
manliest
comeliest
boldest
spirit
i
ever
saw
in
a
savage
and
his
sister
pocahontas
the
king
most
dear
and
daughter
being
but
a
child
of
twelve
or
thirteen
years
of
age
whose
compassionate
pitiful
heart
of
my
desperate
estate
gave
me
much
cause
to
respect
her
i
being
the
first
christian
this
proud
king
and
his
grim
attendants
ever
saw
and
thus
enthralled
in
their
barbarous
power
i
can
not
say
i
felt
the
least
occasion
of
want
that
was
in
the
power
of
these
my
mortal
foes
to
prevent
notwithstanding
all
their
threats
after
some
six
weeks
fatting
among
these
savage
courtiers
at
the
minute
of
my
execution
she
hazarded
the
beating
out
of
her
own
brains
to
save
mine
and
not
only
that
but
so
prevailed
with
her
father
that
i
was
safely
conveyed
to
jamestown
where
i
found
about
eight
and
thirty
miserable
poor
and
sick
creatures
to
keep
possession
of
all
those
large
territories
of
virginia
such
was
the
weakness
of
this
poor
commonwealth
as
had
the
savages
not
fed
us
we
directly
had
starved
and
this
relief
most
gracious
queen
was
commonly
brought
us
by
this
lady
pocahontas
all
these
passages
when
inconstant
fortune
turned
our
peace
to
war
this
tender
virgin
would
still
not
spare
to
dare
to
visit
us
and
by
her
our
jars
have
been
oft
appeased
and
our
wants
still
supplied
were
it
the
policy
of
her
father
thus
to
employ
her
or
the
ordinance
of
god
thus
to
make
her
his
instrument
or
her
extraordinary
affection
to
our
nation
i
know
not
but
of
this
i
am
sure
when
her
father
with
the
utmost
of
his
policy
and
power
sought
to
surprise
me
having
but
eighteen
with
me
the
dark
night
could
not
affright
her
from
coming
through
the
irksome
woods
and
with
watered
eyes
gave
me
intelligence
with
her
best
advice
to
escape
his
fury
which
had
he
known
he
had
surely
slain
her
with
her
wild
train
she
as
freely
frequented
as
her
father
habitation
and
during
the
time
of
two
or
three
years
she
next
under
god
was
still
the
instrument
to
preserve
this
colony
from
death
famine
and
utter
confusion
which
if
in
those
times
it
had
once
been
dissolved
virginia
might
have
lain
as
it
was
at
our
first
arrival
to
this
day
then
this
business
having
been
turned
and
varied
by
many
accidents
from
that
i
left
it
at
it
is
most
certain
after
a
long
and
troublesome
war
after
my
departure
betwixt
her
father
and
our
colony
all
which
time
she
was
not
heard
of
two
years
after
she
herself
was
taken
prisoner
being
so
detained
near
two
years
longer
the
colony
by
that
means
was
relieved
peace
concluded
and
at
last
rejecting
her
barbarous
condition
she
was
married
to
an

at

she
is

spoke
english
or
had
a
child
in
marriage
by
an
englishman
a
matter
surely
if
my
meaning
be
truly
considered
and
well
understood
worthy
a
prince
understanding
most
gracious
lady
i
have
related
to
your
majesty
what
at
your
best
leisure
our
approved
histories
will
account
you
at
large
and
done
in
the
time
of
your
majesty
life
and
however
this
might
be
presented
you
from
a
more
worthy
pen
it
can
not
from
a
more
honest
heart
as
yet
i
never
begged
anything
of
the
state
or
any
and
it
is
my
want
of
ability
and
her
exceeding
desert
your
birth
means
and
authority
her
birth
virtue
want
and
simplicity
doth
make
me
thus
bold
humbly
to
beseech
your
majesty
to
take
this
knowledge
of
her
though
it
be
from
one
so
unworthy
to
be
the
reporter
as
myself
her
husband
estate
not
being
able
to
make
her
fit
to
attend
your
majesty
the
most
and
least
i
can
do
is
to
tell
you
this
because
none
so
oft
has
tried
it
as
myself
and
the
rather
being
of
so
great
a
spirit
however
her
stature
if
she
should
not
be
well
received
seeing
this
kingdom
may
rightly
have
a
kingdom
by
her
means
her
present
love
to
us
and
christianity
might
turn
to
such
scorn
and
fury
as
to
divert
all
this
good
to
the
worst
of
evil
whereas
finding
so
great
a
queen
should
do
her
some
honour
more
than
she
can
imagine
for
being
so
kind
to
your
servants
and
subjects
would
so
ravish
her
with
content
as
endear
her
dearest
blood
to
effect
that
your
majesty
and
all
the
honest
subjects
most
earnestly
desire
captain

continues
the
small
time
i
staid
in
london
divers
courtiers
and
others
my
acquaintances
have
gone
with
me
to
see
her
that
generally
concluded
they
did
think
god
had
had
a
great
hand
in
her
conversion
and
they
have
seen
many
english
ladies
worse
favoured
proportioned
and
behavioured
and
as
since
i
have
heard
it
pleased
both
the
king
and
queen
majesty
honourably
to
esteem
her
accompanied
with
that
honourable
lady
the
lady
de

ware
and
that
honourable
lord
her
husband
and
divers
other
persons
of
good
qualities
both
publicly
at
the
masques
and
otherwise
to
her
great
satisfaction
and
content
which
doubtless
she
would
have
deserved
had
she
lived
to
arrive

this
young
lady
to
his

where
she
made
not

that

the
keeping
of

indian
kidnapping
many
are
the
tales
of
how
indians
raiding
a
white
settlement
have
kidnapped
and
adopted
into
their
families
the
children
of
the
slain
whites
but
none
is
more
enthralling
than
that
of
frances
slocum
who
was
carried
away
from
home
by
a
party
of
delawares
when
but
five
years
of
age
and
who
lived
with
them
until
her
death
in
when
discovered
by
the
whites
she
was
an
old
woman
of
over
seventy
years
of
age
the
story
is
told
by
the
writer
of
a
local
history
as
follows
the
slocums
came
from
warwick
rhode
island
and
jonathan
slocum
the
father
of
the
captive
girl
emigrated
in
with
a
wife
and
nine
children
they
located
near
one
of
the
forts
upon
a
spot
of
ground
which
is
at
present
covered
by
the
city
of
the
early
training
of
the
family
had
been
on
principles
averse
to
war
and
jonathan
was
loath
to
mix
with
the
tumult
of
the
valley
a
son
by
the
name
of
giles
of
a
fiery
spirit
could
not
brook
the
evident
intentions
of
the
torys
and
british
and
consequently
he
shouldered
his
musket
and
was
one
to
take
part
in
the
battle
of
july
the
prowling
clans
of
savages
and
bushwhacking
torys
which
continued
to
harass
the
valley
occasioned
much
mischief
in
different
parts
and
in
the
month
of
november
following
the
battle
it
was
the
misfortune
of
the
slocum
family
to
be
visited
by
a
party
of
these
delawares
who
approached
the
cabin
in
front
of
which
two
kingsley
boys
were
engaged
at
a
grindstone
sharpening
a
knife
the
elder
had
on
a
continental
coat
which
aroused
the
ire
of
the
savages
and
he
was
shot
down
without
warning
and
scalped
by
the
very
knife
which
he
had
put
edge
to
the
report
roused
the
inmates
of
the
house
and
slocum
had
reached
the
door
in
time
sufficient
to
see
the
boy
of
her
neighbour
scalped
an
elder
daughter
seized
a
young
child
two
years
old
and
flew
with
terror
to
the
woods
it
is
said
that
her
impetuosity
in
escaping
caused
the
indians
to
roar
with
laughter
they
were
about
to
take
away
a
boy
when
slocum
pointed
to
a
lame
foot
exclaiming
child
is
lame
he
can
do
thee
no
good
they
dropped
the
boy
and
discovered
little
frances
hidden
away
under
the
staircase
it
was
but
the
act
of
a
moment
to
secure
her
and
when
they
bore
her
away
the
tender
child
could
but
look
over
the
indian
shoulder
and
scream
the
alarm
soon
spread
but
the
elasticity
of
a
delaware
step
had
carried
the
party
away
into
the
mountains
slocum
was
absent
at
the
time
of
the
capture
and
upon
returning
at
night
learned
the
sad
news
the
family
trials
did
not
end
here
miner
who
is
ever
in
sympathy
with
the
early
annals
of
wyoming
thus
depicts
the
scenes
which
occurred
afterwards
cup
of
vengeance
was
not
yet
full
december
slocum
and
isaac
tripp
his
an
aged
man
with
william
slocum
a
youth
of
nineteen
or
twenty
were
feeding
cattle
from
a
stack
in
the
meadow
in
sight
of
the
fort
when
they
were
fired
upon
by
indians
slocum
was
shot
dead
tripp
wounded
speared
and
tomahawked
both
were
scalped
william
wounded
by
a
spent
ball
in
the
heel
escaped
and
gave
the
alarm
but
the
alert
and
wily
foe
had
retreated
to
his
in
the
mountain
this
deed
bold
as
it
was
cruel
was
perpetrated
within
the
town
plot
in
the
centre
of
which
the
fortress
was
located
thus
in
little
more
than
a
month
slocum
had
lost
a
beloved
child
carried
into
captivity
the
doorway
had
been
drenched
in
blood
by
the
murder
of
a
member
of
the
family
two
others
of
the
household
had
been
taken
away
prisoners
and
now
her
husband
and
father
were
both
stricken
down
to
the
grave
murdered
and
mangled
by
the
merciless
indians
verily
the
annals
of
indian
atrocities
written
in
blood
record
few
instances
of
desolation
and
woe
equal
to
this
in
after
peace
had
settled
upon
the
country
two
of
the
slocum
brothers
visited
niagara
in
hopes
of
learning
something
of
the
whereabouts
of
the
lost
sister
but
to
no
purpose
large
rewards
were
offered
but
money
will
not
extract
a
confession
from
an
indian
little
frances
all
this
time
was
widely
known
by
many
tribes
of
indians
but
she
had
become
one
of
them
hence
the
mystery
which
shrouded
her
fate
the
efforts
of
the
family
were
untiring
several
trips
were
made
westward
and
each
resulted
in
vain
a
large
number
of
indians
of
different
tribes
were
convened
in
at
tioga
point
to
effect
a
treaty
with
colonel
proctor
this
opportunity
seemed
to
be
the
fitting
one
for
one
visit
could
reach
several
tribes
but
slocum
after
spending
weeks
of
inquiry
among
them
was
again
obliged
to
return
home
in
sorrow
and
almost
despair
the
brothers
took
a
journey
in
occupying
nearly
the
whole
summer
in
traversing
the
wilderness
and
indian
settlements
of
the
west
but
to
no
purpose
once
indeed
a
ray
of
hope
seemed
to
glimmer
upon
the
domestic
darkness
for
a
female
captive
responded
to
the
many
and
urgent
inquiries
but
slocum
discovered
at
once
that
it
was
not
her
frances
the
mother
of
the
lost
child
went
down
to
the
grave
having
never
heard
from
her
daughter
since
she
was
carried
away
captive
in
joseph
slocum
hearing
of
a
prominent
wyandot
chief
who
had
a
white
woman
for
a
wife
repaired
to
sandusky
but
was
disappointed
when
he
beheld
the
woman
who
he
knew
to
a
certainty
could
not
be
frances
hope
had
become
almost
abandoned
and
the
family
was
allowing
the
memory
of
the
lost
girl
to
sink
into
forgetfulness
when
one
of
those
strange
freaks
of
circumstances
which
seem
so
mysterious
to
humanity
but
which
are
the
ordinary
actions
of
infinity
brought
to
light
the
history
and
the
person
of
the
captive
girl
of
wyoming
colonel
ewing
who
was
connected
with
indian
service
had
occasion
to
rest
with
a
tribe
on
the
wabash
when
he
discovered
a
woman
whose
outlines
and
texture
convinced
him
that
she
must
be
a
white
woman
though
her
face
was
as
red
as
any
squaw
could
be
he
made
inquiries
and
she
admitted
that
she
had
been
taken
from
her
parents
when
she
was
young
that
her
name
was
slocum
and
that
she
was
now
so
old
that
she
had
no
objections
to
having
her
relations
know
of
her
whereabouts
the
colonel
knew
full
well
how
anxious
many
eastern
hearts
were
to
hear
of
the
lost
one
of
earlier
days
and
thinking
that
he
would
do
a
charitable
service
he
addressed
the
following
letter
to
the
of
lancaster
pennsylvania
indiana
sir
the
hope
that
some
good
may
result
from
it
i
have
taken
this
means
of
giving
to
your
say
the
descendants
of
the
early
settlers
of
susquehanna
the
following
information
and
if
there
be
any
now
living
whose
name
is
slocum
to
them
i
hope
the
following
may
be
communicated
through
the
public
prints
of
your
place
is
now
living
near
this
place
among
the
miami
tribe
of
indians
an
aged
white
woman
who
a
few
days
ago
told
me
while
i
lodged
in
the
camp
one
night
that
she
was
taken
away
from
her
father
house
on
or
near
the
susquehanna
river
when
she
was
very
young
say
from
five
to
eight
years
old
as
she
thinks
by
the
delaware
indians
who
were
then
hostile
toward
the
whites
she
says
her
father
name
was
slocum
that
he
was
a
quaker
rather
small
in
stature
and
wore
a
hat
was
of
sandy
hair
and
light
complexion
and
much
freckled
that
he
lived
about
a
half
a
mile
from
a
town
where
there
was
a
fort
that
they
lived
in
a
wooden
house
of
two
stories
high
and
had
a
spring
near
the
house
she
says
three
delawares
came
to
the
house
in
the
daytime
when
all
were
absent
but
herself
and
perhaps
two
other
children
her
father
and
brothers
were
absent
making
hay
the
indians
carried
her
off
and
she
was
adopted
into
a
family
of
delawares
who
raised
her
and
treated
her
as
their
own
child
they
died
about
forty
years
ago
somewhere
in
ohio
she
was
then
married
to
a
miami
by
whom
she
had
four
children
two
of
them
are
now
living
they
are
both
daughters
and
she
lives
with
them
her
husband
is
dead
she
is
old
and
feeble
and
thinks
she
will
not
live
long
considerations
induced
her
to
give
the
present
history
of
herself
which
she
would
never
do
before
fearing
that
her
kindred
would
come
and
force
her
away
she
has
lived
long
and
happy
as
an
indian
and
but
for
her
colour
would
not
be
suspected
of
being
anything
else
but
such
she
is
very
respectable
and
wealthy
sober
and
honest
her
name
is
without
reproach
she
says
her
father
had
a
large
family
say
eight
children
in
all
six
older
than
herself
one
younger
as
well
as
she
can
recollect
and
she
doubts
not
that
there
are
still
living
many
of
their
descendants
but
seems
to
think
that
all
her
brothers
and
sisters
must
be
dead
as
she
is
very
old
herself
not
far
from
the
age
of
eighty
she
thinks
she
was
taken
prisoner
before
the
last
two
wars
which
must
mean
the
revolutionary
war
as
war
and
the
late
war
have
been
since
that
one
she
has
entirely
lost
her
mother
tongue
and
speaks
only
in
indian
which
i
also
understand
and
she
gave
me
a
full
history
of
herself
own
christian
name
she
has
forgotten
but
says
her
father
name
was
slocum
and
he
was
a
quaker
she
also
recollects
that
it
was
on
the
susquehanna
river
that
they
lived
i
have
thought
that
from
this
letter
you
might
cause
something
to
be
inserted
in
the
newspapers
of
your
county
that
might
possibly
catch
the
eye
of
some
of
the
descendants
of
the
slocum
family
who
have
knowledge
of
a
girl
having
been
carried
off
by
the
indians
some
seventy
years
ago
this
they
might
know
from
family
tradition
if
so
and
they
will
come
here
i
will
carry
them
where
they
may
see
the
object
of
my
letter
alive
and
happy
though
old
and
far
advanced
in
life
can
form
no
idea
whereabouts
on
the
susquehanna
river
this
family
could
have
lived
at
that
early
period
namely
about
the
time
of
the
revolutionary
war
but
perhaps
you
can
ascertain
more
about
it
if
so
i
hope
you
will
interest
yourself
and
if
possible
let
her
brothers
and
sisters
if
any
be
alive
if
not
their
children
know
where
they
may
once
more
see
a
relative
whose
fate
has
been
wrapped
in
mystery
for
seventy
years
and
for
whom
her
bereaved
and
afflicted
parents
doubtless
shed
many
a
bitter
tear
they
have
long
since
found
their
graves
though
their
lost
child
they
never
found
i
have
been
much
affected
with
the
disclosure
and
hope
the
surviving
friends
may
obtain
through
your
goodness
the
information
i
desire
for
them
if
i
can
be
of
any
service
to
them
they
may
command
me
in
the
meantime
i
hope
you
will
excuse
me
for
the
freedom
i
have
taken
with
you
a
total
stranger
and
believe
me
to
be
sir
with
much
respect
your
obedient
servant
w
ewing
this
letter
met
the
fate
of
many
others
of
importance
it
was
flung
away
as
a
wild
story
the
postmaster
died
and
had
been
in
his
grave
time
sufficient
to
allow
his
wife
an
opportunity
of
straightening
his
affairs
she
was
in
the
act
of
overhauling
a
mass
of
papers
belonging
to
her
business
when
she
encountered
the
letter
of
colonel
ewing
a
perceptions
are
keen
and
quick
and
the
tender
emotions
which
were
begotten
in
her
mind
were
but
the
responses
of
her
better
nature
her
sympathy
yearned
for
one
of
her
own
sex
and
she
could
do
no
more
than
proclaim
the
story
to
the
world
accordingly
she
sent
the
letter
to
the
editor
of
the
lancaster
and
therein
it
was
published
newspapers
of
limited
circulation
may
not
revolutionize
matters
of
great
importance
but
they
have
their
sphere
in
detail
and
when
the
aggregate
is
summed
they
accomplish
more
than
the
mighty
engines
of
larger
mediums
it
was
so
in
this
case
the
lancaster
paper
was
about
issuing
an
extra
for
temperance
purposes
and
this
letter
happened
to
go
into
the
forme
to
help
up
as
poor
printers
sometimes
express
it
the
lancaster
office
was
not
poor
but
the
foreman
did
up
with
the
ewing
letter
rev
samuel
bowman
of
by
chance
saw
a
copy
he
knew
the
slocums
and
the
entire
history
of
the
valley
as
it
was
given
by
tradition
he
was
not
present
in
the
valley
at
the
time
but
his
heart
warmed
for
the
scenes
and
associations
of
early
times
in
wyoming
he
mailed
one
of
the
papers
to
a
slocum
a
brother
of
the
captive
girl
and
the
effect
produced
was
as
if
by
magic
everybody
was
acquainted
with
the
history
of
frances

the

could
not

when
a

had
played
with

and
by

blow
from

a
finger
was
crushed
in

a
manner
that
it
never

its
original

her
memory
proved
to

unerring
the

sixty

for
the
withered

her
life
although

had
been

the
erection

was
usually
attended
with
great
ceremony

kinship

hunting
hunting
was
almost
the

occupation
of
the
males
of
the
indian
tribes
so
much
were
they
dependent
on
the
produce
of
the
chase
for
their
livelihood
that
they
developed
the
pursuit
of
game
into
an
art
in
commerce
they
confined
themselves
to
trading
in
skins
and
furs
but
they
disposed
of
these
only
when
their
personal
or
tribal
requirements
had
been
fully
satisfied
when
the
tribe
had
returned
from
its
summer
hunting
expedition
and
after
the
spoils
of
the
chase
had
been
faithfully
distributed
among

members

tribal
custom
which
was
rigorously
adhered
to
ceremonial
rites
were
engaged
in
and
certain
sacred
formulæ
were
observed
in
hunting
game
the
indians
usually
erected
pens
or
enclosures
into
which
the
beasts
were
driven
and
slaughtered
early
writers
believed
that
they
fired
the
prairie
grass
and
pressed
in
upon
the
herd
but
this
is
contradicted
by
the
indians
themselves
who
assert
that
fire
would
be
injurious
to
the
fur
of
the
animals
hunted
indeed
such
an
act
causing
a
herd
to
scatter
was
punishable
by
death
in
exceptional
cases
however
the
practice
might
be
resorted
to
in
order
to
drive
the
animals
into
the
woods
in
pursuing
their
prey
it
was
customary
for
the
tribe
to
form
a
circle
and
thus
prevent
escape
the
most
favourable
months
for
hunting
were
june
july
and
august
when
the
animals
were
fat
and
the
fur
of
rich
quality
to
the
hunter
who
had
slain
the
animal
the
tribe
awarded
the
skin
and
part
of
the
carcass
the
other
portions
were
usually
divided
among
the
inhabitants
of
the
village
as
a
result
of
this
method
of
sharing
there
was
very
little
waste
the
flesh
which
was
cut
into
thin
slices
was
hung
up
to
dry
in
the
sun
on
long
poles
and
rolled
up
and
stored
for
winter
use
the
pelts
were
used
in
the
making
of
clothing
shields
and
bags
ropes
tents
and
other
articles
were
also
prepared
from
the
skins
bowstrings
and
were
made
from
the
sinews
and
were
shaped
out
of
the
larger
bones
among
the
methods
employed
in
capturing
game
was
the
setting
of
traps
into
which
the
animal
was
decoyed
a
more
primitive
method
of
taking
animals
by
the
hand
was
largely
in
use
the
hunter
would
steal
upon
his
prey
in
the
dead
of
night
using
the
utmost
cunning
and
agility
and
seize
upon
the
unwary
bird
or
sleeping
animal
the
indians
were
skilled
in
climbing
and
diving
and
employing
the
art
of
mimicry
in
which
they
attained
great
proficiency
they
would
surround
a
herd
of
animals
and
drive
them
into
a
narrow
gorge
out
of
which
they
could
not
escape
their
edged
weapons
fashioned
from
stone
bones
and
reeds
and
used
with
great
skill
assisted
them
effectually
when
brought
to
close
quarters
with
their
prey
dogs
although
not
regularly
trained
they
found
of
much
value
in
the
hunt
especially
for
tracking
down
the
more
swift
and
savage
beasts
with
the
assistance
of
fire
the
hunter
conquest
over
the
animal
became
assured
his
prey
would
be
driven
out
of
its
by
smoke
or
the
torch
would
dazzle
it
drugging
animals
with
poisonous
roots
and
polluting
streams
to
capture
fish
were
largely
practised
the
use
of
nets
and
scoops
for
taking
animals
from
the
water
and
the
fashioning
of
rakes
for
securing
worms
from
the
earth
were
other
methods
employed
to
obtain
food
the
use
of
the
canoe
gave
rise
to
the
invention
of
the
harpoon
the
wandering
habits
of
their
game
and
the
construction
of
fences
were
obstacles
which
strengthened
their
perception
and
gave
excellent
training
for
the
hunt
the
variety
of
circumstances
with
which
they
had
to
meet
caused
them
to
prepare
or
devise
the
many
weapons
and
snares
to
which
they
resorted
certain
periods
or
seasons
of
the
year
were
observed
for
the
hunting
of
particular
animals
each
of
which
figured
as
a
token
or
heraldic
symbol
of
a
tribe
or
schoolcraft
in
an
accurate
and
entertaining
account
of
indian
hunting
in
his
and
statistical
information
respecting
the
indian
says
the
simplest
of
all
species
of
hunting
is
perhaps
the
art
of
hunting
the
deer
this
animal
it
is
known
is
endowed
with
the
fatal
curiosity
of
stopping
in
its
flight
to
turn
round
and
look
at
the
object
that
disturbed
it
and
as
this
is
generally
done
within
the
habit
is
indulged
at
the
cost
of
its
life
whereas
if
it
trusted
unwaveringly
to
its
heels
it
would
escape
one
of
the
most
ingenious
modes
of
hunting
the
deer
is
that
of
which
is
done
by
descending
a
stream
in
a
canoe
at
night
with
a
flambeau
in
the
latter
part
of
spring
and
summer
the
indian
hunters
on
the
small
interior
rivers
take
the
bark
of
the
elm
or
cedar
peeling
it
off
whole
for
five
or
six
feet
in
length
and
turning
it
inside
out
paint
the
outer
surface
black
with
charcoal
it
is
then
pierced
with
an
orifice
to
fit
it
on
the
bow
of
the
canoe
so
as
to
hide
the
sitter
then
a
light
or
torch
is
made
by
small
rolls
two
or
three
feet
long
of
twisted
birch
bark
which
is
very
inflammable
and
this
is
placed
on
the
extreme
bow
of
the
boat
a
little
in
front
of
the
bark
screen
in
which
position
it
throws
its
rays
strongly
forward
leaving
all
behind

darkness
the
deer
whose
eyes
are
fixed
on
the
light
as
it
floats
down

thus
brought
within
range
of
the
gun
swans
are
hunted
in
the
same
way
the
mazes
of
the
forest
are
however
the
indian
hunter
peculiar
field
of
action
no
footprint
can
be
impressed
there
with
which
he
is
not
familiar
in
his
temporary
journeys
in
the
search
after
game
he
generally
encamps
early
and
sallies
out
at
the
first
peep
of
day
on
his
hunting
tour
if
he
is
in
a
forest
country
he
chooses
his
ambush
in
valleys
for
the
plain
reason
that
all
animals
as
night
approaches
come
into
the
valleys
in
ascending
these
he
is
very
careful
to
take
that
side
of
a
stream
which
throws
a
shadow
from
it
so
that
he
may
have
a
clear
view
of
all
that
passes
on
the
opposite
side
while
he
is
himself
screened
by
the
shadow
but
he
is
particularly
on
the
alert
to
take
this
precaution
if
he
is
apprehensive
of
lurking
foes
the
tracks
of
an
animal
are
the
subject
of
the
minutest
observation
they
tell
him
at
a
glance
the
species
of
animal
that
has
passed
the
time
that
has
elapsed
and
the
course
it
has
pursued
if
the
surface
of
the
earth
be
moist
the
indications
are
plain
if
it
be
hard
or
rocky
they
are
drawn
from
less
palpable
but
scarcely
less
unmistakable
signs
one
of
the
largest
and
most
varied
days
hunt
of
which
we
are
apprised
was
by
a
noted
chippeway
hunter
named
nokay
on
the
upper
mississippi
who
tradition
asserts
in
one
day
near
the
mouth
of
the
crow
wing
river
killed
sixteen
elk
four
buffaloes
five
deer
three
bears
one
lynx
and
a
porcupine
this
feat
has
doubtless
been
exceeded
in
the
buffalo
ranges
of
the
where
the
bow
and
arrow
is
known
to
have
been
so
dexterously
and
rapidly
applied
in
respect
to
that
animal
but
it
is
seldom
that
the
chase
in
forest
districts
is
as
successful
as
in
this
instance
on
one
occasion
the
celebrated
chief
wabojeeg
went
out
early
in
the
morning
near
the
banks
of
lake
superior
to
set
he
had
set
about
forty
and
was
returning
to
his
wigwam
armed
with
his
hatchet
and
knife
only
when
he
encountered
a
buck
moose
he
sheltered
himself
behind
trees
retreating
but
as
the
animal
pursued
he
picked
up
a
pole
and
unfastening
his
tied
the
knife
firmly
to
the
pole
he
then
took
a
favourable
position
behind
a
tree
and
stabbed
the
animal
several
times
in
the
throat
and
breast
at
length
it
fell
and
he
cut
out
and
carried
home
the
tongue
as
a
trophy
of
his
prowess
in
gitshe
iawba
of
kewywenon
lake
superior
killed
a
moose
of
three
hundred
pounds
weight
it
was
in
the
month
of
february
and
the
snow
was
so
soft
from
a
partial
thaw
that
the
or
sank
deep
at
every
step
after
cutting
up
the
animal
and
drawing
out
the
blood
he
wrapped
the
flesh
in
the
skin
and
putting
himself
under
it
rose
up
erect
finding
he
could
bear
the
weight
he
then
took
a
litter
of
nine
pups
in
a
blanket
upon
his
right
arm
threw
his
wallet
on
top
of
his
head
and
putting
his
gun
over
his
left
shoulder
walked
six
miles
to
his
wigwam
this
was
the
strongest
man
that
has
appeared
in
the
chippeway
nation
in
modern
times
in
annimikens
of
red
river
of
the
north
was
one
day
quite
engrossed
in
looking
out
a
path
for
his
camp
to
pass
when
he
was
startled
by
the
sharp
snorting
of
a
grizzly
bear
he
immediately
presented
his
gun
and
attempted
to
fire
but
the
priming
not
igniting
he
was
knocked
by
the
animal
the
next
instant
several
steps
backward
and
his
gun
driven
full
fifteen
feet
through
the
air
the
bear
then
struck
him
on
one
cheek
and
tore
away
a
part
of
it
the
little
consciousness
he
had
left
told
him
to
be
passive
and
manifest
no
signs
of
life
fortunately
the
beast
had
satiated
his
appetite
on
the
carcass
of
a
buffalo
near
by
having
clawed
his
victim
at
pleasure
he
then
took
him
by
the
neck
dragged
him
into
the
bushes
and
there
left
him
yet
from
such
a
wound
the
indian
recovered
though
a
disfigured
man
and
lived
to
tell
me
the
story
with
his
own
lips
relations
of
such
hunting
exploits
and
adventures
are
vividly
repeated
in
the
indian
country
and
constitute
a
species
of
renown
which
is
eagerly
sought
by
the
young
costume
the
picturesque
costume
of
the
red
man
is
so
original
in
character
as
to
deserve
more
than
passing
mention
an
authority
on
indian
costume
writing
in
of
the
bureau
of
american
ethnology
says
the
tribes
of
northern
america
belong
in
general
to
the
wholly
clothed
peoples
the
exceptions
being
those
inhabiting
the
warmer
regions
of
the
southern
united
states
and
the
pacific
coast
who
were
tanned
skin
of
the
deer
family
was
generally
the
material
for
clothing
throughout
the
greater
part
of
the
country
the
hide
of
the
buffalo
was
worn
for
robes
by
tribes
of
the
plains
and
even
for
dresses
and
leggings
by
older
people
but
the
leather
was
too
harsh
for
clothing
generally
while
or
although
soft
was
too
thick
fabrics
of
bark
hair
fur
wool
and
feathers
were
made
in
the
north
pacific
pueblo
and
southern
regions
and
cotton
has
been
woven
by
the
hopi
from
ancient
times
climate
environment
elevation
and
oceanic
currents
determined
the
materials
used
for
clothing
as
well
as
the
demand
for
clothing
sinew
from
the
tendons
of
the
larger
animals
was
the
usual
sewing
material
but
fibres
of
plants
especially
the
agave
were
also
employed
bone
awls
were
used
in
sewing
bone
needles
were
rarely
employed
and
were
too
large
for
fine
work
the
older
needlework
is
of
exceptionally
good
character
and
shows
great
skill
with
the
awl
unlike
many
other
arts
sewing
was
practised
by
both
sexes
and
each
sex
usually
made
its
own
clothing
the
typical
and
more
familiar
costume
of
the
indian
man
was
of
tanned
buckskin
and
consisted
of
a
shirt
a
leggings
tied
to
a
belt
or
and
low
moccasins
the
shirt
which
hung
free
over
the
hips
was
provided
with
sleeves
and
was
designed
to
be
drawn
over
the
head
the
woman
costume
differed
from
that
of
the
man
in
the
length
of
the
shirt
which
had
short
sleeves
hanging
loosely
over
the
upper
arm
and
in
the
absence
of
the
women
also
wore
the
belt
to
confine
the
garment
at
the
waist
robes
of
skin
woven
fabrics
or
of
feathers
were
also
worn
but
blankets
were
substituted
for
these
later
the
costume
presented
tribal
differences
in
cut
colour
and
ornamentation
the
free
edges
were
generally
fringed
and
quill
embroidery
and
beadwork
painting
tails
of
animals
feathers
claws
hoofs
shells
were
applied
as
ornaments
or
charms
the
typical
dress
of
the
pueblo
indians
is
generally
similar
to
that
of
the
plains
tribes
except
that
it
is
made
largely
of
woven
fabrics
among
the
pacific
coast
tribes
and
those
along
the
mexican
border

gulf
and
the
atlantic
coast

customary
garment
of

seasons

occupations

worn
for
occasional
use
in
cooler
weather
a
skin
robe
or
cape
was
thrown
about
the
shoulders
or
under
exceptional
conditions
a
large
robe
woven
of
strips
of
ceremonial
costume
was
much
more
elaborate
than
that
for
ordinary
wear
moccasins
and
leggings
were
worn
throughout
much
of
this
area
but
in
the
warmer
parts
and
in
california
their
use
was
unusual
some
tribes
near
the
mexican
boundary
wear
sandals
and
tribes
once
ranged
widely
in

also
been
found
in
kentucky

a
account
of
how
the
indian
brave
decorated
his
face
can
not
but
prove
of
interest
says
a
writer
who
dwelt
for
some
time
among
the
sioux
kohl
daily
when
i
had
the
opportunity
i
drew
the
patterns
their
faces
displayed
and
at
length
obtained
a
collection
whose
variety
even
astonished
myself
the
strange
combinations
produced
in
the
kaleidoscope
may
be
termed
weak
when
compared
to
what
an
imagination
produces
on
his
forehead
nose
and
cheek
i
will
try
to
give
some
account
of
them
as
far
as
words
will
reach
two
things
struck
me
most
in
their
arrangement
of
colour
first
the
fact
that
they
did
not
trouble
themselves
at
all
about
the
natural
divisions
of
the
face
and
secondly
the
extraordinary
mixture
of
the
graceful
and
the
grotesque
at
times
it
is
true
they
did
observe
those
natural
divisions
produced
by
nose
eyes
mouth
etc
the
eyes
were
surrounded
with
regular
coloured
circles
yellow
or
black
stripes
issued
harmoniously
and
equidistant
from
the
mouth
over
the
cheeks
ran
a
semicircle
of
green
dots
the
ears
forming
the
centre
at
times
too
the
forehead
was
traversed
by
lines
running
parallel
to
the
natural
contour
of
that
feature
this
always
looked
somewhat
human
so
to
speak
because
the
fundamental
character
of
the
face
was
unaltered
usually
however
these
regular
patterns
do
not
suit
the
taste
of
the
indians
they
like
contrasts
and
frequently
divide
the
face
into
two
halves
which
undergo
different
treatment
one
will
be
dark
say
black
or
blue
but
the
other
quite
light
yellow
bright
red
or
white
one
will
be
crossed
by
thick
lines
made
by
the
forefingers
while
the
other
is
arabesque
with
extremely
fine
lines
produced
by
the
aid
of
a
brush
this
division
is
produced
in
two
different
ways
the
line
of
demarcation
sometimes
runs
down
the
nose
so
that
the
right
cheek
and
side
are
buried
in
gloom
while
the
left
looks
like
a
in
the
sunshine
at
times
though
they
draw
the
line
across
the
nose
so
that
the
eyes
glisten
out
of
the
dark
colour
while
all
beneath
the
nose
is
bright
and
lustrous
it
seems
as
if
they
wished
to
represent
on
their
faces
the
different
phases
of
the
moon
i
frequently
inquired
whether
there
was
any
significance
in
these
various
patterns
but
was
assured
it
was
a
mere
matter
of
taste
they
were
simple
arabesques
like
their
squaws
work
on
the
moccasins
girdles
etc
still
there
is
a
certain
symbolism
in
the
use
of
the
colours
thus
red
generally
typifies
joy
and
festivity
and
black
mourning
when
any
very
melancholy
death
takes
place
they
rub
a
handful
of
charcoal
over
the
entire
face
if
the
deceased
is
only
a
distant
relative
a
mere
of
black
lines
is
painted
on
the
face
they
have
also
a
and
only
paint
half
the
face
black
red
is
not
only
their
joy
but
also
their
favourite
colour
they
generally
cover
their
face
with
a
coating
of
bright
red
on
which
the
other
colours
are
laid
for
this
purpose
they
employ
vermilion
which
comes
from
china
and
is
brought
them
by
the
indian
traders
however
this
red
is
by
no
means
frequently
the
ground
colour
is
a
bright
yellow
for
which
they
employ
obtained
from
the
trader
they
are
also
very
partial
to
prussian
blue
and
employ
this
colour
not
only
on
their
faces
but
as
a
type
of
peace
on
their
pipes
and
as
the
hue
of
the
sky
on
their
graves
it
is
a
very
curious
fact
by
the
way
that
hardly
any
indian
can
distinguish
blue
from
green
i
have
seen
the
sky
which
they
represent
on
their
graves
by
a
round
arch
as
frequently
of
one
colour
as
the
other
in
the
sioux
language
signifies
both
green
and
blue
and
a
jesuit
father
told
me
that
among
many
indian
tribes
the
same
confusion
prevails
i
have
also
been
told
that
tribes
have
their
favourite
colours
and
i
am
inclined
to
believe
it
although
i
was
not
able
to
recognize
any
such
rule
generally
all
indians
seem
to
hold
their
own
native
copper
skin
in
special
affection
and
heighten
it
with
vermilion
when
it
does
not
seem
to
them
sufficiently
red
i
discovered
during
a
journey
i
took
among
the
sioux
that
there
is
a
certain
national
style
in
this
they
were
talking
of
a
poor
indian
who
had
gone
mad
and
when
i
asked
some
of
his
countrymen
present
in
what
way
he
displayed
his
insanity
they
said
he
dresses
himself
up
so
funnily
with
feathers
and
shells
he
paints
his
face
so
comically
that
it
is
enough
to
make
one
die
of
laughing
this
was
said
to
me
by
persons
so
overladen
with
feathers
shells
green
and
vermilion
prussian
blue
and
that
i
could
hardly
refrain
from
smiling
still
i
drew
the
conclusion
from
it
that
there
must
be
something
conventional
and
typical
in
their
variegated
style
which
might
be
easily
infringed
indian
art
if
the
red
race
of
north
america
did
not
produce
artistic
work
of
an
exalted
order
it
at
least
evolved
a
distinctive
and
peculiar
type
of
art
some
of
the
drawings
and
paintings
on
the
walls
of
the
brick
erections
of
the
southern
tribes
and
the
heraldic
and
religious
symbols
painted
on
the
lodges
of
the
plains
people
are
intricate
and
rhythmic
in
plan
and
brilliant
in
colouring
the
houses
of
the
coast
tribes
built
entirely
of
wood
are
supported
by
pillars
elaborately
carved
and
embellished
to
represent
the
totem
or
tribal
symbol
of
the
owner
on
both
the
interior
and
exterior
walls
brilliantly
coloured
designs
usually
scenes
from
indian
mythology
are
found
the
decoration
of
earthenware
was
and
is
common
to
most
of
the
tribes
of
north
america
and
is
effected
both
by
carving
and
stamping
it
is
in
the
art
of
carving
that
the
indian
race
appears
to
have
achieved
its
greatest
æsthetic
triumph
many
carved
objects
are
exceedingly
elaborate
and
intricate
in
design
and
some
of
the
work
on
stone
pipes
masks
and
household
utensils
and
ornaments
has
won
the
highest
admiration
of
european
masters
of
the
art
indeed
many
of
the
pipes
and
claystone
carvings
of
the
chimpseyans
and
clallams
of
vancouver
and
the
chippeways
and
babeens
are
by
no
means
inferior
to
the
best
specimens
of
european
mediæval
carved
work
in
the
potter
art
the
indian
people
often
exhibit
great
taste
and
the
tribes
of
the
mississippi
valley
and
the
pueblo
indians
had
made
exceptional
progress
in
plaster
design
as
has
already
been
mentioned
the
displayed
considerable
skill
in
metalwork
and
the
stamped
plates
of
copper
taken
from
the
earthen
pyramids
which
they
raised
strikingly
illustrate
the
fact
that
indian
art
is
the
growth
and
outcome
of
centuries
of
native
effort
and
by
no
means
a
thing
of
yesterday
in
weaving
needlework
of
all
kinds
and
the
indians
show
great
taste
most
of
the
designs
they
employ
are
geometric
in
plan
in
especially
the
aboriginal
peoples
of
the
whole
american
continent
excel
rank
was
indicated
among
the
plains
tribes
either
by
the
variety
and
number
of
feathers
worn
or
by
the
manner
of
mounting
or
notching
them
the
aboriginal
art
of
north
america
is
in
the
highest
degree
symbolic
and
mythologic
it
is
thus
entirely
removed
from
any
taint
of
materialism
and
had
it
been
permitted
to
evolve
upon
its
own
peculiar
lines
it
might
have
developed
a
great
measure
of
idealistic
excellence
warfare
in
the
art
of
guerrilla
warfare
the
indians
have
always
shown
exceptional
skill
armed
with
bow
and
arrow
a
or
a
tomahawk
they
carried
on
a
fierce
resistance
to
the
incursions
of
the
white
man
these
weapons
were
artistically
shaped
and
moulded
and
were
eminently
suited
to
their
owner
mode
of
fighting
but
as
they
came
more
into
contact
with
the
whites
the
natives
displayed
a
particular
keenness
to
obtain
firearms
and
gunpowder
steel
knives
and
hatchets
they
dispensed
with
their
own
rude
if
effective
implements
of
war
and
obtaining
the
coveted
weapons
by
making
successful
raids
upon
the
camps
of
their
enemies
they
set
themselves
to
learn
how
to
use
them
so
mysterious
did
gunpowder
appear
to
them
that
they
believed
it
to
possess
the
property
of
reproduction
and
planted
it
in
the
earth
in
the
hope
that
it
would
yield
a
supply
for
their
future
needs
in
attacking
the
settlers
they
used
many
ingenious
artifices
to
entrap
or
ambuscade
them
these
methods
naturally
proved
successful
against
the
whites
who
had
yet
to
learn
indian
but
soon
the
settlers
learned
to
adopt
the
same
devices
the
indian
would
imitate
the
cry
of
the
wild
goose
to
attract
the
white
hunter
into
the
woods
where
he
would
spring
upon
him
he
would
also
reverse
his
in
winter
to
make
it
appear
to
the
settler
that
he
was
retreating
covering
themselves
with
twigs
to
look
like
a
bush
was
another
method
adopted
by
indian
spies
occasionally
they
would
approach
the
white
man
apparently
in
a
spirit
of
friendliness
only
to
commit
some
act
of
treachery
were
built
by
the
settlers
as
a
means
of
defence
against
indian
nocturnal
surprises
and
into
these
the
women
and
children
were
hurried
for
safety
but
the
perseverance
of
the
white
man
and
the
declining
of
the
indian
tribes
began
to
create
a
new
situation
driven
repeatedly
from
one
part
of
the
country
to
another
and
confined
to
a
limited
territory
in
which
to
live
hunt
and
cultivate
the
soil
the
indians
finally
adopted
a
less
aggressive
attitude
to
those
whom
they
at
first
and
for
some
time
after
their
settlement
regarded
with
suspicion
and
resentment
although
the
methods
of
warfare
differed
with
the
various
tribes
the
general
scheme
of
operations
was
usually
dictated
by
the
council
of
chiefs
in
whose
hands
the
making
of
peace
and
war
also
lay
the
campaign
was
generally
prefaced
by
many
eloquent
harangues
from
the
leaders
who
gradually
wrought
the
braves
into
a
fury
of
resentment
against
their
enemies
the
ceremony
of
the
was
then
proceeded
with
ranged
in
a
circle
the
warriors
executed
a
kind
of
shuffle
occasionally
slowly
gyrating
with
gestures
and
movements
obviously
intended
to
imitate
those
of
some
bird
or
beast
and
grunting
clucking
and
snarling
the
while
this
ceremony
was
always
undertaken
in
full
panoply
of
and
feathers
subsequently
the
braves
betook
themselves
to
the
if
the
campaign
was
undertaken
in
wooded
country
they
marched
in
single
file
the
most
minute
attention
was
paid
to
their
surroundings
to
prevent
ambuscade
the
slightest
sound
even
the
snapping
of
a
twig
was
sufficient
to
arrest
their
attention
and
cause
them
to
halt
alert
suspicious
and
with
every
nerve
strung
to
the
highest
point
of
tension
they
proceeded
with
such
exceeding
caution
that
to
surprise
them
was
almost
impossible
should
a
warrior
become
isolated
from
the
main
body
and
be
attacked
and
fatally
wounded
he
regarded
it
as
essential
to
the
safety
of
his
comrades
to
utter
a
piercing
shriek
which
reverberated
far
through
the
forest
ways
and
placed
the
rest
of
the
band
on
their
guard
this
was
known
as
the
perhaps
their
personal
or
tribal
totems
see
totemism
pp
hence
the
expression
file
when
the
campaign
was
undertaken
in
prairie
or
open
country
the
method
usually
employed
was
that
of
night
attack
but
if
for
any
reason
this
could
not
be
successfully
made
a
large
circle
was
drawn
round
the
place
to
be
assailed
and
gradually
narrowed
the
warriors
who
composed
it
creeping
and
wriggling
through
the
grass
and
when
sufficiently
near
rising
and
rushing
the
camp
or
fort
with
wild
if
a
stout
defence
with
firearms
was
anticipated
the
warriors
would
surround
the
objective
of
attack
on
horseback
and
ride
round
and
round
the
fated
position
gradually
picking
off
the
defenders
with
their
rifles
or
arrows
as
the
opportunity
presented
itself
once
the
place
was
stormed
the
indian
brave
neither
asked
nor
gave
quarter
at
least
so
far
as
its
male
defenders
were
concerned
these
were
at
once
slain
and
scalped
the
latter
sanguinary
process
being
effected
by
the
brave
placing
his
knees
on
his
enemy

a
rapid
circle
with
his
knife

seizing
the
portion
of

scalp
thus
loosened
and
quickly
detaching

upon
which

in

the
acme
of

and
to
learn

accomplishment
at
an
early
period
of
dancing

although
they
are
not
permitted
to
join
its
fascinating
circle
till
they
assume
the
envied
rank
of
actual
warriors
still
their
early
sports
and
mimic
pastimes
are
imitations
of

what
may
be
called

taken
by
youths
at
an
early
age
that
age
may
be
stated
for
general
comparison
to
be
sixteen
but
without
respect
to
exact
time
it
is
always
after
the
primary
fast
during
which
the
youth
chooses
his
personal
guardian
or
an
age
when
he
first
assumes
the
duties
of
manhood
it
is
the
period
of
the
assumption
of
the
blanket
the
true
toga
of
the
north
american
indian
the
whole
force
of
public
opinion
in
our
indian
communities
is
concentrated
on
this
point
its
early
lodge
teachings
such
as
the
recital
of
adventures
of
bravery
its
dances
its
religious
rites
the
harangues
of
prominent
actors
made
at
public
assemblages
such
as
is
called
the
post
all
in
fact
that
serves
to
awaken
and
fire
ambition
in
the
mind
of
the
savage
is
clustered
about
the
idea
of
future
distinction
in
war
the
indian
has
but
one
prime
honour
to
grasp
it
is
triumph
in
the
it
is
rushing
upon
his
enemy
tearing
the
scalp
reeking
from
his
head
and
then
uttering
his
terrific
for
this
crowning
act
he
is
permitted
to
mount
the
honoured
feather
of
the
the
king
of
carnivorous
birds
by
this
mark
he
is
publicly
known
and
his
honours
recognized
by
all
his
tribe
and
by
the
surrounding
tribes
whose
customs
assimilate
when
the
scalp
of
an
enemy
has
been
won
very
great
pains
are
taken
to
exhibit
it
for
this
purpose
it
is
stretched
on
a
hoop
and
mounted
on
a
pole
the
inner
part
is
painted
red
and
the
hair
adjusted
to
hang
in
its
natural
manner
if
it
be
the
scalp
of
a
male
eagle
feathers
are
attached
to
denote
fact
if
a
female
a
comb
or
scissors
is
hung
on
the
frame
in
this
condition
it
is
placed
in
the
hands
of
an
old
woman
who
bears
it
about
in
the
while
opprobrious
epithets
are
uttered
against
the
tribe
from
which
it
was
taken
amidst
these
wild
rejoicings
the
is
vociferated
and
the
general
sentiment
with
old
and
young
is
shall
it
be
done
to
our
enemies
the
feather
of
the
eagle
is
the
highest
honour
that
a
warrior
can
wear
and
a
very
extravagant
sum
is
sometimes
given
to
procure
one
the
value
of
a
horse
has
been
known
to
be
paid
the
mode
in
which
a
feather
is
to
be
cut
and
worn
is
important
to
be
noticed
the
scale
of
honour
with
the
several
tribes
may
vary
but
the
essential
features
are
the
same
among
the
dakota
tribes
an
feather
with
a
red
spot
denotes
that
the
wearer
has
killed
an
enemy
a
notch
cut
in
it
and
edges
of
the
feather
painted
red
indicates
that
the
throat
of
an
enemy
has
been
cut
small
consecutive
notches
on
the
front
side
of
the
feather
without
paint
denote
that
the
wearer
is
the
third
person
that
has
touched
the
dead
body
both
edges
notched
that
he
is
the
fourth
person
who
has
touched
it
and
the
feather
partly
denuded
that
he
is
the
fifth
person
that
has
touched
the
slain
on
the
blanket
or
buffalo
robe
worn
by
the
dakota
indian
a
red
or
black
hand
is
often
seen
painted
the
red
hand
indicates
that
the
wearer
has
been
wounded
by
his
enemy
the
black
hand
that
he
has
slain
his
enemy
the
warlike
tribe
of
the
chippeways
on
the
sources
of
the
mississippi
who
from
a
national
act
in
their
history
bear
the
distinctive
name
of
pillagers
award
a
successful
warrior
who
shoots
down
and
scalps
his
enemy
three
feathers
and
for
the
still
more
dangerous
act
of
taking
a
wounded
prisoner
on
the
field
five
for
they
conceive
that
a
wounded
enemy
is
desperate
and
will
generally
reserve
his
fire
for
a
last
act
of
vengeance
if
he
die
the
moment
after
those
of
the
who
come
up
immediately
and
strike
the
enemy
so
as
to
get
marks
of
blood
on
their
weapons
receive
two
feathers
for
it
is
customary
for
as
many
as
can
to
perform
this
act
those
who
have
been
of
the
and
merely
the
fight
although
they
may
have
no
of
which
to
boast
as
honours
and
may
even
have
lacked
promptness
in
following
the
leader
closely
are
yet
allowed
to
mount
one
feather
these
honours
are
publicly
awarded
no
one
dares
to
assume
them
without
authority
and
there
are
instances
where
the
feathers
falsely
assumed
have
been
pulled
violently
from
their
heads
in
a
public
assemblage
of
the
indians
they
never
however
blame
each
other
for
personal
acts
denoting
cowardice
or
any
species
of
timidity
while
on
the
hoping
by
this
elevated
course
to
encourage
the
young
men
to
do
better
on
another
occasion
all
consist
of
volunteers
the
leader
or
who
attempts
to
raise
one
must
have
some
reputation
to
start
on
his
appeals
at
the
assemblages
for
dancing
the
preliminary
are
to
the
principles
of
bravery
and
nationality
they
are
brief
and
to
the
point
he
is
careful
to
be
thought
to
act
under
the
guidance
of
the
great
spirit
of
whose
secret
will
he
affects
to
be
apprised
in
dreams
or
by
some
rites
the
principle
of
enlistment
is
sufficiently
well
preserved
for
this
purpose
the
leader
who
proposes
to
raise
the
takes
the
in
his
hands
smeared
with
vermilion
to
symbolize
blood
and
begins
his
i
have
witnessed
several
such
scenes
the
songs
are
brief
wild
repetitions
of
sentiments
of
heroic
deeds
or
incitements
to
patriotic
or
military
ardour
they
are
accompanied
by
the
drum
and
rattle
and
by
the
voice
of
one
or
more
choristers
they
are
repeated
slowly
sententiously
and
with
a
measured
cadence
to
which
the
most
exact
time
is
kept
the
warrior
stamps
the
ground
as
if
he
could
shake
the
universe
his
language
is
often
highly
figurative
and
he
deals
with
the
machinery
of
the
clouds
the
flight
of
carnivorous
birds
and
the
influence
of
spiritual
agencies
as
if
the
region
of
space
were
at
his
command
he
imagines
his
voice
to
be
heard
in
the
clouds
and
while
he
stamps
the
ground
with
fury
he
fancies
himself
to
take
hold
of
the
of
the
sky
with
his
hands
every
few
moments
he
stops
abruptly
in
his
circular
path
and
utters
the
piercing
he
must
be
a
cold
listener
who
can
sit
unmoved
by
these
appeals
the
ideas
thrown
out
succeed
each
other
with
the
impetuosity
of
a
torrent
they
are
suggestive
of
heroic
frames
of
mind
of
strong
will
of
burning
sentiment
my
voice
ye
warlike
birds
i
prepare
a
feast
for
you
to
batten
on

see
you
cross
the
enemy
lines

you
i
shall
go
i
wish
the
swiftness
of
your
wings
i
wish
the
vengeance
of
your
claws
i
muster
my
friends
i
follow
your
flight
ho
ye
young
men
that
are
warriors
look
with
wrath
on
the
battlefield
each
warrior
that
rises
and
joins
the
thereby
becomes
a
volunteer
for
the
trip
he
arms
and
equips
himself
he
provides
his
own
sustenance
and
when
he
steps
out
into
the
ring
and
dances
he
chants
his
own
song
and
is
greeted
with
redoubling
yells
these
ceremonies
are
tantamount
to
and
no
young
man
who
thus
comes
forward
can
honourably
withdraw
the
sentiments
of
the
following
song
were
uttered
by
the
celebrated
wabojeeg
as
the
leader
of
the
chippeways
after
a
victory
over

combined

and

and
foxes

falls

latter
part

seventeenth
century

day
when
our
warriors
sprang
with
shouts
on

dastardly

heart
burned
to
take

the
cruel
and
treacherous

the
position
of
women
among
the
north
american
indians
is
distinctly
favourable
when
the
general
circumstances
of
their
environment
are
considered
as
with
most
barbarian
people
the
main
burden
of
the
work
of
the
community
falls
upon
them
but
in
most
cases
the
bulk
of
the
is
provided
by
the
men
who
have
often
to
face
long
and
arduous
hunting
expeditions
in
the
search
for
provender
the
labour
of
planting
and
digging
seed
of
hoeing
harvesting
and
storing
crops
is
invariably
borne
by
the
women
in
the
more
accessible
indian
territory
of
north
america
however
the
practice
of
agriculture
is
falling
into
desuetude
and
the
aborigines
are
becoming
accustomed
to
rely
to
a
great
extent
on
a
supply
of
cereals
from
outside
sources
in
the
art
of
weaving
indian
women
were
and

extremely
skilful
in

southern

hopi

woven
cotton

from
time

among
the
various
tribes
the
institution
of
marriage
greatly
depends
for
its
circumstances
upon
the
system
of
totemism
a
custom
which
will
be
found
fully
described
in
the
chapter
which
deals
with
the
mythology
of
the
red
race
this
system
places
a
taboo
upon
marriages
between
members
of
the
same
clan
or
other
division
of
a
tribe
the
nature
of
the
ceremony
itself
differs
with
locality
and
race
among
the
plains
indians
polygamy
was
common
and
the
essential
feature
of
the
ceremony
was
the
presentation
of
gifts
to
the
bride
father
in
some
tribes
the
husband
had
absolute
power
and
separation
and
divorce
were
common
but
other
plains
people
were
free
from
the
purchase
system
and
the
wishes
of
their
women
were
consulted

speaking
the

one
of
the
most
pleasing
features
in

is
the
great
affection

solicitude
bestowed
by
the

upon
their
children
as
a
close
student
of
indian
custom
and

the
relation
of
parent
to

brings
out
all
the

traits
of

withal
infant

is

adventure
with

an
account
of
the
manner
in
which
a
young
indian
beheld
his
totem
states
that
the
lad
father
sent
him
to
a
to
look
for
utonagan
the
female
guardian
spirit
of
his
ancestors
at
noon
on
his
arrival
at
the
mountain
he
heard
the
howls
of
the
totem
spirit
and
commenced
to
ascend
the
slope
chilled
by
fear
as
the
yells
grew
louder
he
climbed
a
tree
and
still
heard
the
cries
and
the
rustle
of
the
spirit
in
the
branches
below
then
terror
overcame
him
and
he
fled
utonagan
pursued
him
she
gained
upon
him
howling
so
that
his
knees
gave
way
beneath
him
and
he
might
not
turn
then
he
bethought
him
of
one
of
his
guardian
spirits
and
with
a
fresh
access
of
courage
he
left
his
pursuer
far
behind
he
cast
away
his
blanket
utonagan
reached
it
and
after
snuffing
at
it
took
up
the
chase
once
more
then
he
thought
of
his
guardian
spirit
the
wolf
and
again
new
strength
came
to
him
still
in
great
terror
he
looked
back
utonagan
followed
with
a
lope
then
he
thought
of
his
guardian
spirit
the
bitch
and
once
more
he
gained
ground
at
length
exhausted
by
his
exertions
he
sank
to
the
earth
in
a
fainting
condition
and
fell
asleep
through
the
eyes
of
sleep
he
saw
the
spirit
as
a

said
to

another

is
told
of
an
indian

vigil
catherine
wabose
when
about
thirteen
years
of
age
left
her
mother
lodge
and
built
a
small
one
for
herself
after
a
fast
of
four
days
she
was
visited
by
her
mother
who
gave
her
a
little
to
drink
on
the
eve
of
the
sixth
day
while
still
fasting
she
was
conscious
of
a
superhuman
voice
which
invited
her
to
walk
along
a
shining
path
which
led
forward
and
upward
there
she
first
met
the
standing
woman
who
gave
her
her
name
she
next
met
the
man
spirit
who
told
her
that
his
name
would
be
the
name
of
her
first
son
she
was
next
addressed
by
the
blue
sky
who
endowed
her
with
the
gift
of
life
she
was
then
encircled
by
bright
points
of
light
and
by
sharp
painless
instruments
but
mounting
upon
a
animal
she
swam
through
the
air
back
to
her
lodge
on
the
sixth
day
she
experienced
a
repetition
of
the
vision
on
the
seventh
day
she
was
fed
with
a
little
pounded
corn
in
after
the
seventh
day
she
beheld
a
large
round
object
like
a
stone
descend
from
the
sky
and
enter
the
lodge
it
conferred
upon
her
the
gift
of
prophecy
and
by
virtue
of
this
she
assumed
the
rank
of
a
prophetess
upon
her
return
to
the
tribe
it
is
not
difficult
to
suppose
that
the
minds
of
these
unfortunate
children
were
temporarily
deranged
by
the
sustained
fasts
they
had
been
forced
to
undertake
most
of
the
tribes
of
north
america
had
evolved
a
rude
system
of
this
consisted
for
the
most
part
of
figures
of
natural
objects
connected
by
symbols
having
arbitrary
or
fixed
meanings
thus
the
system
was
both
ideographic
and
pictographic
that
is
it
represented
to
some
extent
abstract
ideas
as
well
as
concrete
objects
these
scripts
possessed
so
many
arbitrary
characters
and
again
so
many
symbols
which
possessed
different
meanings
under
varying
circumstances
that
to
interpret
them
is
a
task
of
the
greatest
complexity
they
were
usually
employed
in
the
compilation
of
the
seasonal
calendars
and
sometimes
the
records
of
the
tribe
were
preserved
by
their
means

asiatic
peoples
have
passed
through
this
stage
and
its
remains
are
to
be
found
deeply
embedded
in
our
present
social
system
totemic
law
and
custom
few
generations
would
elapse
before
the
sense
of
ancestral
devotion
to
the
totem
or
eponymous
forefather
of
the
tribe
would
become
so
strong
as
to
be
exalted
into
a
fully
developed
system
of
worship
of
him
as
a
deity
that
the
totem
develops
into
the
god
is
proved
by
the
animal
likeness
and
attributes
of
many
deities
in
lands
widely
separate
it
accounts
for
the
and
gods
of
egypt
the
deities
of
assyria
the
bestial
gods
of
hindustan
possibly
even
for
the
owl
which
accompanied
the
grecian
pallas
for
does
not
homer
speak
of
her
as
may
not
this
goddess
have
developed
from
an
owl
totem
and
may
not
the
attendant
bird
of
night
which
perches
on
her
shoulder
have
been
permitted
to
remain
as
a
sop
to
her
devotees
in
her
more
ancient
form
who
objected
to
her
portrayal
as
a
human
being
and
desired
that
some
reminder
of
her
former
shape
might
be
preserved
that
our
british
ancestors
possessed
a
totemic
system
is
undoubted
were
not
the
clan
chattan
of
the
scottish
highlands
the
sons
of
the
cat
in
the
of
lismores
we
read
of
a
tribe
included
under
the
sons
to
the
king
of
rualay
one
battalion
of
whom
was
or
wore
the
totem
crest
of
the
cat
the
and
other
animal
deities
possessed
by
the
british
celts
assist
this
theory
as
do
the
remains
of
many
in
england
and
scotland
our
crests
are
but
so
many
family
symbols
which
have
come
down
to
us
from
the
distant
days
when
our
forefathers
painted
them
upon
their
shields
or
wore
them
upon
their
helmets
as
the
badge
of
their
tribe
and
thus
of
its
supposed
or
protector
as
has
been
said
a
vast
and
intricate
system
of
tribal
law
and
custom
arose
from
the
adoption
of
totemism
the
animal
from
which
the
tribe
took
its
name
might
not
be
killed
or
eaten
because
of
its
with
the
clan
descent
from
this
ancestor
postulated
kinship
between
the
various
members
of
the
tribe
male
and
female
therefore
the
female
members
were
not
eligible
for
marriage
with
the
males
who
had
perforce
to
seek
for
wives
elsewhere
this
often
led
to
the
partial
adoption
of
another
tribe
or
family
in
the
vicinity
and
of
its
totem
in
order
that
a
suitable
exchange
of
women
might
be
made
as
occasion
required
and
thus
to
the
inclusion
of
two
or
divisions
within
the
tribe
each
with
its
different
yet
each
regarding
itself
as
a
division
of
the
tribal
family
thus
a
member
of
the
might
not
marry
a
woman
of
his
own
division
but
must
seek
a
bride
from
the
and
similarly
a
tribesman
must
find
a
wife
from
among
the
severity
of
totemic
rule
the
utmost
severity
attached
to
the
observation
of
totemic
law
and
custom
to
break
which
was
regarded
as
a
serious
crime
indeed
no
one
ever
thought
of
infringing
it
so
powerful
are
habit
and
the
force
of
association
it
is
not
necessary
to
specify
here
the
numerous
customs
which
may
be
regarded
as
the
outcome
of
the
totemic
system
for
many
of
these
have
little
in
common
with
mythology
proper
it
will
suffice
to
say
that
they
were
observed
with
a
rigour
beside
which
the
rules
of
the
religions
of
civilized
peoples
appear
lax
and
indulgent
as
this
system
exercised
such
a
powerful
influence
on
indian
life
and
thought
the
following
passage
from
the
pen
of
a
high
authority
on
indian
totemism
may
be
quoted
with
advantage
swanton
in
of
the
north
american
the
native
american
indian
holding
peculiar
views
as
to
the
unity
and
continuity
of
all
life
and
the
consequent
inevitable
interrelations
of
the
several
bodies
and
beings
in
nature
especially
of
man
to
the
beings
and
bodies
of
his
experience
and
environment
to
whom
were
imputed
by
him
various
anthropomorphic
attributes
and
functions
in
addition
to
those
naturally
inherent
in
them
has
developed
certain
fundamentally
important
cults
based
on
those
views
that
deeply
affect
his
social
religious
and
civil
institutions
one
of
these
doctrines
is
that
persons
and
organizations
of
persons
are
one
and
all
under
the
protecting
and
fostering
tutelage
of
some
imaginary
being
or
spirit
these
tutelary
or
patron
beings
may
be
grouped
by
the
mode
and
motive
of
their
acquirement
and
their
functions
into
two
fairly
well
defined
groups
or
classes
those
which
protect
individuals
only
and
those
which
protect
organizations
of
persons
but
with
these
two
classes
of
tutelary
beings
is
not
infrequently
confounded
another
class
of
protective
imaginary
beings
commonly
called
fetishes
which
are
regarded
as
powerful
spiritual
allies
of
their
possessors
each
of
these
several
classes
of
guardian
beings
has
its
own
peculiar
traditions
beliefs
and
appropriate
cult
the
modes
of
the
acquirement
and
the
motives
for
the
acquisition
of
these
several
classes
of
guardian
beings
differ
in
some
fundamental
and
essential
respects
the
exact
method
of
acquiring
the
clan
or
gentile
group
patrons
or
tutelaries
is
still
an
unsolved
problem
although
several
plausible
theories
have
been
advanced
by
astute
students
to
explain
the
probable
mode
of
obtaining
them
with
respect
to
the
personal
tutelary
and
the
fetish
the
data
are
sufficiently
clear
and
full
to
permit
a
satisfactory
description
and
definition
of
these
two
classes
of
tutelary
and
auxiliary
beings
from
the
available
data
bearing
on
this
subject
it
would
seem
that
much
confusion
regarding
the
use
and
acquirement
of
personal
and
communal
tutelaries
or
patron
beings
has
arisen
by
regarding
certain
social
political
and
religious
activities
as
due
primarily
to
the
influence
of
these
guardian
deities
when
in
fact
those
features
were
factors
in
the
social
organization
on
which
has
been
later
imposed
the
cult
of
the
patron
or
guardian
spirit
exogamy
names
and
class
names
and
various
taboos
exist
where
and
the
cults
of
the
guardian
spirits
do
not
exist
some
profess
to
regard
the
clan
or
gentile
group
patron
or
tutelary
as
a
mere
development
of
the
personal
guardian
but
from
the
available
but
insufficient
data
bearing
on
the
question
it
appears
to
be
in
some
of
its
aspects
more
closely
connected
in
origin
or
rather
in
the
method
of
its
acquisition
with
the
fetish
the
iroquois
effective
agency
of
sorcery
than
with
any
form
of
the
personal
tutelary
this
patron
spirit
of
course
concerns
the
group
regarded
as
a
body
for
with
regard
to
each
person
of
the
group
the
clan
or
gentile
guardian
is
inherited
or
rather
acquired
by
birth
and
it
may
not
be
changed
at
will
on
the
other
hand
the
personal
tutelary
is
obtained
through
the
rite
of
vision
in
a
dream
or
a
trance
and
it
must
be
preserved
at
all
hazards
as
one
of
the
most
precious
possessions
the
fetish
is
acquired
by
personal
choice
by
purchase
or
by
inheritance
or
from
some
chance
circumstance
or
emergency
and
it
can
be
sold
or
discarded
at
the
will
of
the
possessor
in
most
cases
the
exception
is
where
a
person
has
entered
into
a
compact
with
some
evil
spirit
or
being
that
in
consideration
of
human
or
other
sacrifices
in
its
honour
at
stated
periods
the
said
spirit
undertakes
to
perform
certain
obligations
to
this
man
or
woman
and
in
default
of
which
the
person
forfeits
his
right
to
live
is
a
purely
philosophical
term
which
modern
anthropological
literature
has
burdened
with
a
great
mass
of
needless
controversial
speculation
and
opinion
the
doctrine
and
use
of
tutelary
or
patron
guardian
spirits
by
individuals
and
by
organized
bodies
of
persons
are
defined
by
powell
as
method
of
naming
and
as
doctrine
and
system
of
naming
but
the
motive
underlying
the
acquisition
and
use
of
guardian
or
tutelary
spirits
whether
by
an
individual
or
by
an
organized
body
of
persons
is
always
the
same
namely
to
obtain
welfare
and
to
avoid
so
it
appears
to
be
erroneous
to
define
this
cult
as
doctrine
and
system
of
naming
it
is
rather
the
recognition
exploitation
and
adjustment
of
the
imaginary
mystic
relation
of
the
individual
or
of
the
body
of
organized
persons
to
the
postulated
mystic
powers
surrounding
each
of
these
units
of
native
society
with
but
few
exceptions
the
recognized
relation
between
the
clan
or
and
its
patron
deity
is
not
one
of
descent
or
source
but
rather
that
of
protection
guardianship
and
support
the
relationship
as
to
source
between
these
two
classes
of
superior
beings
is
not
yet
determined
so
to
avoid
confusion
in
concepts
it
is
better
to
use
distinctive
names
for
them
until
their
connexion
if
any
has
been
definitely
ascertained
this
question
must
not
be
prejudged
the
hypothetic
inclusion
of
these
several
classes
in
a
general
one
branded
with
the
rubric
or
its
equivalent
has
led
to
needless
confusion
the
native
tongues
have
separate
names
for
these
objects
and
until
the
native
classification
can
be
truthfully
shown
to
be
erroneous
it
would
seem
to
be
advisable
to
designate
them
by
distinctive
names
notwithstanding
the
great
amount
of
study
of
the
literature
of
the
social
features
of
aboriginal
american
society
there
are
many
data
relative
to
this
subject
that
have
been
overlooked
or
disregarded
fetishism
side
by
side
with
animism
and
totemism
flourishes
a
third
type
of
primitive
belief
known
as
this
word
is
derived
from
the
portuguese
charm
made
by
art
and
is
applied
to
any
object
large
or
small
natural
or
artificial
regarded
as
possessing
consciousness
volition
and
supernatural
qualities
and
especially
or
magic
power
as
has
been
said
the
indian
intelligence
regards
all
things
animals
water
the
earth
trees
stones
the
heavenly
bodies
even
night
and
day
and
such
properties
as
light
and
darkness
as
possessing
animation
and
the
power
of
volition
it
is
however
the
general
indian
belief
that
many
of
these
are
under
some
spell
or
potent
enchantment
the
rocks
and
trees
are
confidently
believed
by
the
indian
to
be
the
living
tombs
of
imprisoned
spirits
resembling
the
dryads
of
greek
so
that
it
is
not
difficult
for
him
to
conceive
an
intelligence
more
or
less
potent
in
any
object
no
matter
how
uncommon
indeed
the
more
uncommon
the
greater
the
probability
of
its
being
the
abode
of
some
powerful
intelligence
incarcerated
for
revenge
or
some
similar
motive
by
the
spell
of
a
mighty
enchanter
the
fetish
is
in
short
a
mascot
a
the
civilized
person
who
attaches
a
swastika
or
small
charm
to
his
or
her
bangle
is
unconsciously
following
in
the
footsteps
of
many
pagan
ancestors
but
with
this
difference
that
the
idea
that
resides
in
the
trinket
is
weak
in
the
civilized
mind
whereas
in
the
savage
belief
the
resident
in
the
fetish
is
a
powerful
and
living
thing
an
intelligence
which
must
be
placated
with
prayer
feast
and
sacrifice
fetishes
which
lose
their
reputations
as
bringers
of
usually
degenerate
into
mere
amulets
or
talismanic
ornaments
and
their
places
are
taken
by
others
the
fetish
differs
from
the
class
of
tutelary
or
gods
in
that
it
may
be
sold
or
bartered
whereas
tutelary
or
domestic
deities
are
never
to
be
purchased
or
even
loaned
fetish
objects
nearly
all
the
belongings
of
a
or
are
classed
as
fetishes
by
the
north
american
indians
these
usually
consist
of
the
skins
of
beasts
birds
and
serpents
roots
bark
powder
and
numberless
other
objects
but
the
fetish
must
be
altogether
divorced
from
the
idea
of
religion
proper
with
which
it
has
little
or
no
connexion
being
found
side
by
side
with
religious
phases
of
many
types
the
fetish
may
be
a
bone
a
feather
an
a
stick
carved
or
painted
a
fossil
a
tuft
of
hair
a
necklace
of
fingers
a
stuffed
skin
the
hand
of
an
enemy
anything
which
might
be
suggested
to
the
original
possessor
in
a
dream
or
a
flight
of
imagination
it
is
sometimes
fastened
to
the
to
the
dress
to
the
bridle
concealed
between
the
layers
of
a
shield
or
specially
deposited
in
a
shrine
in
the
wigwam
the
idea
in
the
mind
of
the
original
maker
is
usually
symbolic
and
is
revealed
only
to
one
formally
chosen
as
heir
to
the
magical
possession
and
pledged
in
his
turn
to
a
similar
secrecy
notwithstanding
that
the
cult
of
fetishism
is
not
strictly
speaking
a
department
of
religious
activity
a
point
exists
at
which
the
fetish
begins
to
evolve
into
a
god
this
happens
when
the
object
survives
the
test
of
experience
and
achieves
a
more
than
personal
or
tribal
popularity
nevertheless
the
fetish
partakes
more
of
the
nature
of
those
spirits
which
are
subservient
to
man
for
example
the
arabian
than
of
gods
proper
and
if
it
is
prayed
and
sacrificed
to
on
occasion
the
are
rather
of
the
nature
of
a
magical
invocation
and
the
no
more
than
would
be
accorded
to
any
other
assisting
agent
thus
sharply
must
we
differentiate
between
a
fetish
or
captive
spirit
and
a
god
but
it
must
be
further
borne
in
mind
that
a
fetish
is
not
necessarily
a
piece
of
personal
property
it
may
belong
collectively
to
an
entire
community
it
is
not
necessarily
a
small
article
but
may
possess
all
the
appearances
of
a
idol
an
idol
however
is
the
abode
of
a
god
the
image
into
which
a
deity
may
materialize
a
fetish
on
the
other
hand
is
place
of
imprisonment
of
a
subservient
which
can
not
escape
and
if
it
would
gain
the
rank
of
godhead
must
do
so
by
a
long
series
of
or
at
least
by
the
performance
of
a
number
of
marvels
of
a
protective
or
nature
it
is
not
unlikely
that
a
belief
exists
in
the
indian
mind
that
there
are
many
wandering
spirits
who
in
return
for
food
and
other
comforts
are
willing
to
materialize
in
the
shape
the
savage
provides
for
them
and
to
assist
him
in
the
chase
and
other
pursuits
of
life
apache
fetishes
among
the
athapascan
indians
the
apaches
both
male
and

wear
fetishes
which
they
call
manufactured
from
wood
generally
pine
or
cedar
or
fir
from
the
mountains
these
are
highly
valued
and
are
never
sold
they
are
shaved
very
thin
rudely
carved
in
the
semblance
of
the
human
form
and
decorated
with
incised
lines
representing
the
lightning
they
are
small
in
size
and
few
of
them
are

bourke
describes
one
that
an
apache
chief
carried
about
with
him
which
was
made
of
a
piece
of
lath
unpainted
having
a
figure
in
yellow
drawn
upon
it
with
a
narrow
black
band
and
three
snake
heads
with
white
eyes
it
was
further
decorated
with
pearl
buttons
and
small
feathers
the
reverse
and
obverse
were
identical
many
of
the
apaches
attached
a
piece
of
malachite
to
their
guns
and
bows
to
make
them
shoot
accurately
bourke
mentions
a
class
of
fetishes
which
he
terms
these
are
pieces
of
buckskin
or
other
material
upon
which
are
inscribed
certain
characters
or
symbols
of
a
religious
or
nature
and
they
are
worn
attached
to
the
person
who
seeks
benefit
from
them
they
differ
from
the
ordinary
fetish
in
that
they
are
concealed
from
the
public
gaze
these
bourke
says
themselves
medicine
may
be
employed
to
enwrap
other
and
thus
augment
their
own
potentialities
he
describes
several
of
these
objects
one
worn
by
an
indian
named
was
tightly
rolled
in
at
least
half
a
mile
of
silk
and
when
brought
to
light
was
found
to
consist
of
a
small
piece
of
buckskin
two
inches
square
upon
which
were
drawn
red
and
yellow
crooked
lines
which
represented
the
red
and
yellow
snake
inside
were
a
piece
of
malachite
and
a
small
cross
of
pine
and
two
very
small
perforated
shells
the
cross
they
designated
black
mind
another
consisted
of
a
tiny
bag
of
hoddentin
holding
a
small
quartz
crystal
and
four
feathers
of
this
charm
it
was
explained
by
an
indian
contained
not
merely
the
of
the
crystal
and
the
eagle
but
also
that
of
the
black
bear
the
white
lion
and
the
yellow
snake
iroquoian
fetishes
things
that
seem
at
all
unusual
are
accepted
by
the
hurons
a
tribe
of
the
iroquois
as
or
supernatural
and
therefore
it
is
accounted
lucky
to
find
them
in
hunting
if
they
find
a
stone
or
other
object
in
the
entrails
of
an
animal
they
at
once
make
a
fetish
of
it
any
object
of
a
peculiar
shape
they
treasure
for
the
same
reason
they
greatly
fear
that
demons
or
evil
spirits
will
purloin
their
fetishes
which
they
esteem
so
highly
as
to
propitiate
them
in
feasts
and
invoke
them
in
song
the
highest
type
of
fetish
obtainable
by
a
huron
was
a
piece
of
the
onniont
or
great
armoured
serpent
a
mythological
animal
revered
by
many
north
american
tribes
fetishism
among
the
algonquins
hoffmann
states
that
at
the
lodges
of
some
algonquian
tribes
there
are
preserved
fetishes
or
amulets
worn
above
the
elbows
consisting
of
strands
of
metal
bands
or
skunk
skins
while
bracelets
of
shells
buckskin
or
metal
are
also
worn
a
great
tribal
fetish
of
the
cheyenne
was
their
arrow
which
was
taken
from
them
by
the
pawnees
in
battle
the
head
of
this
arrow
projects
from
the
bag
which
contains
it
and
it
is
covered
with
delicate
waved
or
spiral
lines
which
denote
its
sacred
character
it
was
indeed
the
palladium
of
the
tribe
a
peculiar
type
of
fetish
consisted
of
a
mantle
made
from
the
skin
of
a
deer
and
covered
with
feathers
mixed
with
headings
it
was
made
and
used
by
the
as
a
mantle
of
invisibility
or
charmed
covering
to
enable
spies
to
traverse
an
enemy
country
in
security
in
this
instance
the
fetishistic
power
depended
upon
the
devices
drawn
upon
the
article
the
principal
fetishes
among
the
hidatsa
tribe
of
the
sioux
are
the
skins
of
foxes
and
wolves
the
favourite
worn
fetish
being
the
stripe
from
the
back
of
a
with
the
tail
hanging
down
the
shoulders
a
slit
is
made
in
the
skin
through
which
the
warrior
puts
his
head
so
that
the
skin
of
the
wolf
head
hangs
down
upon
his
breast
the
most
common
tribal
fetishes
of
the
sioux
are
or
were
buffalo
heads
the
of
which
they
preserve
in
the
belief
that
the
buffalo
herds
will
thereby
be
prevented
from
removing
to
too
great
a
distance
at
certain
periods
they
perform
a
ceremony
with
these
bones
which
consists
in
taking
a
potsherd
filled
with
embers
throwing
grease
upon
it
and
fumigating
the
bones
with
the
smoke
there
are
certain
trees
and
stones
which
are
regarded
as
fetishes
to
these
offerings
of
red
cloth
red
paint
and
other
articles
are
made
each
individual
has
his
personal
fetish
and
it
is
carried
in
all
hunting
and
warlike
excursions
it
usually
consists
of
a
head
claws
stuffed
skin
or
other
representative
feature
of
the
fetish
animal
even
the
horses
are
provided
with
fetishes
in
the
shape
of
a
horn
to
ensure
their
swiftness
the
rodent
teeth
of
the
beaver
are
regarded
as
potent
charms
and
are
worn
by
little
girls
round
their
necks
to
make
them
industrious
at
sikyatki
in
arizona
a
territorial
nucleus
of
the
hopi
indians
fewkes
had
opportunities
of
inspecting
many
interesting
fetish
forms
a
number
of
these
discovered
in
native
graves
were
pebbles
with
a
polished
surface
or
having
a
fancied
resemblance
to
some
animal
shape
many
of
the
personal
fetishes
of
the
hopi
consist
of
fossils
some
of
which
attain
the
rank
of
tribal
fetishes
and
are
wrapped
up
in
sacred
bundles
which
are
highly
venerated
in
one
grave
was
found
a
single
large
fetish
in
the
shape
of
a
mountain
lion
made
of
sandstone
in
which
legs
ears
tail
and
eyes
are
represented
the
mouth
still
showing
the
red
pigment
with
which
it
had
been
coloured
this
is
almost
identical
with
some
fetishes
used
by
the
hopi
at
the
present
day
totemism
and
fetishism
meet
fetishism
among
the
zuñi
indians
of
the
south
arose
from
an
idea
they
entertained
that
they
were
kin
with
animals
in
other
words
their
fetishes
were
totemistic
totemism
and
fetishism
were
by
no
means
incompatible
with
one
another
but
often
flourished
side
by
side
fetishism
of
the
zuñi
description
is
indeed
the
natural
concomitant
of
a
totemic
system
zuñi
fetishes
are
usually
concretions
of
lime
or
objects
in
which
a
natural
resemblance
to
animals
has
been
heightened
by
artificial
means
ancient
fetishes
are
much
valued
by
these
people
and
are
often
found
by
them
in
the
vicinity
of
villages
inhabited
by
their
ancestors
and
as
tribal
possessions
are
handed
down
from
one
generation
to
another
the
believe
them
to
be
the
actual
petrifactions
of
the
animals
they
represent
the
the
zuñi
philosophy
of
the
fetish
is
given
in
the
tale
of
the
two
as
follows
now
that
the
surface
of
the
earth
was
hardened
even
the
animals
of
prey
powerful
and
like
the
fathers
gods
themselves
would
have
devoured
the
children
of
men
and
the
two
thought
it
was
not
well
that
they
should
all
be
permitted
to
live
for
said
they
the
children
of
men
and
the
children
of
the
animals
of
prey
multiply
themselves
the
animals
of
prey
are
provided
with
talons
and
teeth
men
are
but
poor
the
finished
beings
of
earth
therefore
the
weaker
whenever
they
came
across
the
pathway
of
one
of
these
animals
were
he
a
great
mountain
lion
or
but
a
mere
mole
they
struck
him
with
the
fire
of
lightning
which
they
carried
on
their
magic
shields
and
instantly
he
was
shrivelled
and
turned
into
stone
then
said
they
to
the
animals
that
they
had
changed
into
stone
ye
may
not
be
evil
unto
man
but
that
ye
may
be
a
great
good
unto
them
have
we
changed
you
into
rock
everlasting
by
the
magic
breath
of
prey
by
the
heart
that
shall
endure
for
ever
within
you
shall
ye
be
made
to
serve
instead
of
to
devour
mankind
thus
was
the
surface
of
the
earth
hardened
and
scorched
and
many
of
all
kinds
of
beings
changed
to
stone
thus
too
it
happens
that
we
find
here
and
there
throughout
the
world
their
forms
sometimes
large
like
the
beings
themselves
sometimes
shrivelled
and
distorted
and
we
often
see
among
the
rocks
the
forms
of
many
beings
that
live
no
longer
which
shows
us
that
all
was
different
in
the
of
the
new
of
these
petrifactions
which
are
of
course
mere
concretions
or
strangely
shaped
the
zuñi
say
of
us
may
be
met
with
the
light
of
such
great
may
see
them
and
should
treasure
them
for
the
sake
of
the
sacred
magic
power
which
was
given
them
in
the
days
of
the
new
cushing
the
this
tradition
furnishes
additional
evidence
relative
to
the
preceding
statement
and
is
supposed
to
enlighten
the
zuñi
indian
as
to
wherein
lies
the
power
of
fetishes
it
is
thought
that
the
hearts
of
the
great
animals
of
prey
are
infused
with
a
or
magic
influence
over
the
hearts
of
the
animals
they
prey
upon
and
that
they
overcome
them
with
their
breath
piercing
their
hearts
and
quite
numbing
them
moreover
their
roar
is
fatal
to
the
senses
of
the
lower
beasts
the
mountain
lion
absorbs
the
blood
of
the
game
animals
therefore
he
possesses
their
acute
senses
again
those
powers
as
derived
from
his
heart
are
preserved
in
his
fetish
since
his
heart
still
lives
even
although
his
body
be
changed
to
stone
it
happens
therefore
that
the
use
of
these
fetishes
is
chiefly
connected
with
the
chase
but
there
are
exceptions
the
great
animals
of
the
chase
although
fetishistic
are
also
regarded
as
supernatural
beings
the
mythological
position
of
which
is
absolutely
defined
in
the
city
of
the
mists
lives
father
of
the
societies
a
deity
whose
abode
is
guarded
by
six
beings
known
as
the
and
it
is
their
counterfeit
presentments
that
are
made
use
of
as
fetishes
to
the
north
of
the
city
of
the
mists
dwells
the
mountain
lion
to
the
west
the
bear
to
the
south
the
badger
to
the
east
the
wolf
above
the
eagle
below
the
mole
these
animals
possess
not
only
the
guardianship
of
the
six
regions
but
also
the
mastership
of
the
or
magic
powers
which
emanate
from
them
they
are
the
mediators
between
and
man
the
as
of
the
path
of
life
are
given
high
rank
among
the
gods
but
notwithstanding
this
their
fetishes
are
held
as
in
captivity
by
the
priests
of
the
various
orders
and
greatly
venerated
by
them
as
mediators
between
themselves
and
the
animals
they
represent
in
this
character
they
are
exhorted
with
elaborate
prayers
rituals
and
ceremonials
and
sometimes
placated
with
sacrifices
of
the
of
the
hunt
their
special
priests
are
the
members
of
the
great
coyote
people
that
is
they
consist
of
eleven
members
of
the
eagle
and
coyote
clans
and
of
the
prey
brothers
priesthood
these
appear
to
be
almost
unique
and
may
be
indicated
as
an
instance
of
fetishism
becoming
allied
with
religious
belief
they
depict
with
two
exceptions
the
same
species
of
prey
animals
as
those
supposed
to
guard
the
six
regions
the
exceptions
being
the
coyote
and
the
wild
cat
these
six
prey
animals
are
subdivided
into
six
varieties
they
are
strictly
speaking
the
property
of
the
priests
and
members
and
priests
of
the
sacred
societies
are
required
to
deposit
their
fetishes
when
not
in
use
with
the
keeper
of
the
medicine
of
the
deer
these
or
memberships
alone
can
perfect
the
shape
of
the
fetishes
and
worship
them
the
council
of
fetishes
the
day
of
the
council
of
the
fetishes
takes
place
a
little
before
or
after
the
winter
solstice
or
national
new
year
the
fetishes
are
taken
from
their
places
of
deposit
and
arranged
according
to
species
and
colour
in
the
form
of
a
symbolic
altar
quadrupeds
being
placed
upright
and
birds
suspended
from
the
roof
the
fetishes
are
prayed
to
and
is
scattered
over
them
chants
are
intoned
and
a
dance
performed
in
which
the
cries
of
the
fetish
beasts
are
imitated
a
prayer
with
responses
follows
finally
all
assemble
round
the
altar
and
repeat
the
great
invocation
the
fetish
in
hunting
the
use
of
fetishes
in
hunting
among
the
zuñi
is
extremely
curious
and
involved
in
its
nature
the
hunter
goes
to
the
house
of
the
deer
medicine
where
the
vessel
containing
the
fetish
is
brought
out
and
placed
before
him
he
sprinkles
meal
over
the
sacred
vessel
in
the
direction
in
which
he
intends
to
hunt
chooses
a
fetish
from
it
and
presses
it
to
his
lips
with
an
inspiration
he
then
places
the
fetish
in
a
buckskin
bag
over
his
heart
proceeding
to
the
hunt
he
deposits
a
of
yucca
leaves
where
an
animal
has
rested
imitates
its
cry
and
is
supposed
by
this
means
to
confine
its
movements
within
a
narrow
circle
he
then
inspires
deeply
from
the
nostrils
of
the
fetish
as
though
inhaling
the
magic
breath
of
the
god
of
prey
and
then
puffs
the
breath
long
and
loudly
in
the
direction
whence
the
beast
tracks
trend
in
the
belief
that
the
breath
he
has
borrowed
from
the
will
stiffen
the
limbs
of
the
animal
he
hunts
when
the
beast
is
caught
and
killed
he
inhales
its
suspiring
breath
which
he
breathes
into
the
nostrils
of
the
fetish
he
then
dips
the
fetish
in
the
blood
of
the
slain
quarry
sips
the
blood
himself
and
devours
the
liver
in
order
that
he
may
partake
of
the
animal
qualities
the
fetish
is
then
placed
in
the
sun
to
dry
and
lastly
replaced
in
the
buckskin
pouch
with
a
blessing
afterward
being
duly
returned
to
the
keeper
of
the
deer
medicine
indian
theology
the
late
professor
brinton
writing
on
the
indian
attitude
toward
the
eternal
verities
says
of
the
new
nature
to
the
heathen
is
no
harmonious
whole
swayed
by
eternal
principles
but
a
chaos
of
causeless
effects
the
meaningless
play
of
capricious
ghosts
he
investigates
not
because
he
doubts
not
all
events
are
to
him
miracles
therefore
his
faith
knows
no
bounds
and
those
who
teach
him
that
doubt
is
sinful
must
contemplate
him
with
admiration
natural
religions
rarely
offer
more
than
this
negative
opposition
to
reason
they
are
tolerant
to
a
degree
the
savage
void
of
any
clear
conception
of
a
supreme
deity
sets
up
no
claim
that
his
is
the
only
true
church
if
he
is
conquered
in
battle
he
imagines
that
it
is
owing
to
the
inferiority
of
his
own
gods
to
those
of
his
victor
and
he
rarely
therefore
requires
any
other
reasons
to
make
him
a
convert
in
this
view
of
the
relative
powers
of
deities
lay
a
potent
corrective
to
the
doctrine
that
the
fate
of
man
was
dependent
on
the
caprices
of
the
gods
for
no
belief
was
more
universal
than
that
which
assigned
to
each
individual
a
guardian
spirit
this
invisible
monitor
was
an
help
in
trouble
he
suggested
expedients
gave
advice
and
warning
in
dreams
protected
in
danger
and
stood
ready
to
foil
the
machinations
of
enemies
divine
or
human
with
unlimited
faith
in
this
protector
attributing
to
him
the
devices
suggested
by
his
own
quick
wits
and
the
fortunate
chances
of
life
the
savage
escaped
the
oppressive
thought
that
he
was
the
slave
of
demoniac
forces
and
dared
the
dangers
of
the
forest
and
the
without
anxiety
by
far
the
darkest
side
of
such
a
religion
is
that
which
it
presents
to
morality
the
religious
sense
is
by
no
means
the
voice
of
conscience
the
takahli
indian
when
sick
makes
a
full
and
free
confession
of
sins
but
a
murder
however
unnatural
and
unprovoked
he
does
not
mention
not
counting
it
a
crime
scenes
of
licentiousness
were
approved
and
sustained
throughout
the
continent
as
acts
of
worship
maidenhood
was
in
many
parts
freely
offered
up
or
claimed
by
the
priests
as
a
right
in
central
america
twins
were
slain
for
religious
motives
human
sacrifice
was
common
throughout
the
tropics
and
was
not
unusual
in
higher
latitudes
cannibalism
was
often
enjoined
and
in
peru
florida
and
central
america
it
was
not
uncommon
for
parents
to
slay
their
own
children
at
the
behest
of
a
priest
the
philosophical
moralist
contemplating
such
spectacles
has
thought
to
recognize
in
them
one
consoling
trait
all
history
it
has
been
said
shows
man
living
under
an
irritated
god
and
seeking
to
appease
him
by
sacrifice
of
blood
the
essence
of
all
religion
it
has
been
added
lies
in
that
of
which
sacrifice
is
the
symbol
namely
in
the
offering
up
of
self
in
the
rendering
up
of
our
will
to
the
will
of
god
but
sacrifice
when
not
a
token
of
gratitude
can
not
be
thus
explained
it
is
not
a
rendering
up
but
a
of
our
will
for
god
will
a
deity
is
angered
by
neglect
of
his
dues
he
will
revenge
certainly
terribly
we
know
not
how
or
when
but
as
punishment
is
all
he
desires
if
we
punish
ourselves
he
will
be
satisfied
and
far
better
is
such
torture
than
a
fearful
of
judgment
to
come
craven
fear
not
without
some
dim
sense
of
the
implacability
of
nature
laws
is
at
its
roots
looking
only
at
this
side
of
religion
the
ancient
philosopher
averred
that
the
gods
existed
solely
in
the
apprehensions
of
their
votaries
and
the
moderns
have
asserted
that
is
the
father
of
religion
love
her
daughter
that
first
form
of
religious
belief
is
nothing
else
but
a
horror
of
the
unknown
and
that
natural
religion
appears
to
have
been
able
to
develop
from
a
germ
within
itself
anything
whatever
of
real
advantage
to
civilization
looking
around
for
other
standards
wherewith
to
measure
the
progress
of
the
knowledge
of
divinity
in
the
new
world
suggests
itself
as
one
of
the
least
deceptive
to
quote
the
words
of
novalis
in
religion
what
thought
is
in
philosophy
the
religious
sense
prays
as
the
reason
thinks
guizot
carrying
the
analysis
farther
thinks
that
it
is
prompted
by
a
painful
conviction
of
the
inability
of
our
will
to
conform
to
the
dictates
of
reason
originally
it
was
connected
with
the
belief
that
divine
caprice
not
divine
law
governs
the
universe
and
that
material
benefits
rather
than
spiritual
gifts
are
to
be
desired
the
gradual
recognition
of
its
limitations
and
proper
objects
marks

the
prayer
contains
seven
petitions
only
one
of
which
is
for
a
temporal
advantage
and
it
the
least
that
can
be
asked
for
what
immeasurable
interval
between
it
and
the
prayer
of
the
nootka
indian
preparing
for
war
quahootze
let
me
live
not
be
sick
find
the
enemy
not
fear
him
find
him
asleep
and
kill
a
great
many
of
him
or
again
between
it
and
a
petition
of
a
huron
to
a
local
god
heard
by
father
brébeuf
thou
who
liveth
in
this
spot
i
offer
thee
tobacco
help
us
save
us
from
shipwreck
defend
us
from
our
enemies
give
us
a
good
trade
and
bring
us
back
safe
and
sound
to
our
villages
this
is
a
fair
specimen
of
the
supplications
of
the
lowest
religions
another
equally
authentic
is
given
by
father
allouez
in
he
penetrated
to
an
outlying
algonkin
village
never
before
visited
by
a
white
man
the
inhabitants
startled
by
his
pale
face
and
long
black
gown
took
him
for
a
divinity
they
invited
him
to
the
council
lodge
a
circle
of
old
men
gathered
round
him
and
one
of
them
approaching
him
with
a
double
handful
of
tobacco
thus
addressed
him
the
others
grunting
approval
indeed
is
well
blackrobe
that
thou
dost
visit
us
have
mercy
upon
us
thou
art
a
manito
we
give
thee
to
smoke
naudowessies
and
iroquois
are
devouring
us
have
mercy
upon
us
are
often
sick
our
children
die
we
are
hungry
have
mercy
upon
us
hear
me
o
manito
i
give
thee
to

the
earth
yield
us
corn
the
rivers
give
us
fish
sickness
not
slay
us
nor
hunger
so
torment
us
hear
us
o
manito
we
give
thee
to
smoke
in
this
rude
but
touching
petition
wrung
from
the
heart
of
a
miserable
people
nothing
but
their
wretchedness
is
visible
not
the
faintest
trace
of
an
aspiration
for
spiritual
enlightenment
cheers
the
eye
of
the
philanthropist
not
the
remotest
conception
that
through
suffering
we
are
purified
can
be
detected
the
indian
idea
of
god
the
mythologies
of
the
several
stocks
of
the
red
race
differ
widely
in
conception
and
detail
and
this
has
led
many
hasty
investigators
to
form
the
conclusion
that
they
were
therefore
of
separate
origin
but
careful
study
has
proved
that
they
accord
with
all
great
mythological
systems
in
their
fundamental
principles
and
therefore
with
each
other
the
idea
of
god
often
strange
and
grotesque
perhaps
was
nevertheless
powerfully
expressed
in
the
indian
mythologies
each
division
of
the
race
possessed
its
own
word
to
signify
some
of
these
words
meant
which
is
above
higher
one
invisible
and
these
attributes
accorded
to
deity
show
that
the
original
indian
conception
of
it
was
practically
the
same
as
those
which
obtained
among
the
primitive
peoples
of
europe
and
asia
the
idea
of
god
was
that
of
a
great
prevailing
force
who
resided
in
the
sky
savage
or
primitive
man
observes
that
all
brightness
emanates
from
the
firmament
above
him
his
eyes
are
dazzled
by
its
splendour
therefore
he
concludes
that
it
must
be
the
abode
of
the
source
of
all
life
of
all
spiritual
excellence
and
before
man
has
discovered
the
uses
of
that
higher
machinery
of
reason
philosophy
and
has
learned
to
marshal
his
theological
ideas
by
its
light
such
deities
as
he
worships
conform
very
much
to
his
own
ethical
standard
they
mirror
his
morality
or
lack
of
it
they
are
like
himself
savage
cruel
insatiable
in
their
appetites
very
likely
too
the
bestial
attributes
of
the
totemic
gods
cling
to
those
deities
who
have
been
evolved
out
of
that
system
among
savage
people
ideas
of
good
and
evil
as
we
conceive
them
are
to
them
merely
implies
everything
which
is
to
their
advantage
that
which
injures
or
distresses
them
it
is
only
when
such
a
system
as
totemism
with
its
intricate
taboos
and
stringent
laws
bearing
on
the
various
relationships
of
life
comes
to
be
adopted
that
a
order
arises
slaughter
of
the
totem
animal
becomes
a
sacrilege
slaughter
of
a
member
of
the
totem
clan
of
a
must
be
atoned
for
because
he
is
of
the
totem
blood
marriage
with
a
woman
of
the
same
totem
blood
becomes
an
offence
neglect
to
pay
fitting
homage
and
sacrifice
to
the
gods
or
totem
is
regarded
with
severity
especially
when
the
evolution
of
a
priestly
caste
has
been
achieved
as
the
totem
is
an
ancestor
so
all
ancestors
are
looked
upon
with
reverence
and
deference
to
living
progenitors
becomes
a
virtue
in
such
ways
a
code
of
is
slowly
but
certainly
produced
no
or
gods
but
oddly
enough
the
gods
are
usually
exempt
from
these
laws
by
which
their
worshippers
are
bound
we
find
them
murderous
unfilial
immoral
polygamous
and
often
irreverent
this
may
be
accounted
for
by
the
circumstance
that
their
general
outlines
were
filled
in
before
totemism
had
become
a
fully
developed
system
or
it
may
mean
that
the
savage
did
not
believe
that
divine
beings
could
be
fettered
by
such
laws
as
he
felt
himself
bound
to
obey
however
that
may
be
we
find
the
american
gods
neither
better
nor
worse
than
those
of
other
mythological
systems
some
of
them
are
prone
to
a
sort
of
puckish
trickery
and
are
fond
of
practical
joking
they
had
not
reached
the
exalted
nobility
of
the
pantheon
of
olympus
but
what
is
more
remarkable
and
this
applies
to
the
deities
of
all
primitive
races
we
find
that
they
possess
no
ideas
of
good
and
evil
we
find
them
occasionally
worshipping
gods
of
their
own
usually
the
creative
deities
and
that
may
perhaps
be
accounted
unto
them
for
righteousness
but
they
are
only
to
their
worshippers
inasmuch
as
they
ensure
them
abundant
crops
or
game
and
only
when
they
cease
to
do
so
they
are
not
worshipped
because
they
are
the
founts
of
truth
and
justice
but
for
the
more
immediately
cogent
reason
that
unless
placated
by
the
steam
of
sacrifice
they
will
cease
to
provide
an
adequate
to
man
and
may
malevolently
send
destruction
upon
their
neglectful
worshippers
in
the
relations
between
god
and
man
among
early
peoples
a
specific
contract
is
implied
sacrifice
unto
us
provide
us
with
those
offerings
the
steam
of
which
is
our
food
continue
to
do
so
and
we
will
see
to
it
that
you
do
not
lack
crops
and
game
and
the
essentials
of
life
fail
to
observe
these
customs
and
you
perish
under
such
a
system
it
will
readily
be
granted
that
such
horrors
as
human
sacrifice
were
only
undertaken
because
they
were
thought
to
be
absolutely
necessary
to
the
existence
of
the
race
as
a
whole
and
were
not
prompted
by
any
mere
wanton
delight
in
bloodshed
dealing
with
this
point
the
late
professor
brinton
says
in
his
of
the
new
the
confusion
of
these
distinct
ideas
monotheism
and
polytheism
has
led
to
much
misconception
of
the
native
creeds
but
another
and
more
fatal
error
was
that
which
distorted
them
into
a
dualistic
form
ranging
on
one
hand
the
good
spirit
with
his
legion
of
angels
on
the
other
the
evil
one
with
his
swarm
of
fiends
representing
the
world
as
the
scene
of
their
unending
conflict
man
as
the
unlucky
football
who
gets
all
the
blows
this
notion
which
has
its
historical
origin
among
the
parsees
of
ancient
iran
is
unknown
to
savage
nations
hidatsa
says
matthews
neither
in
a
hell
nor
a
devil
idea
of
the
devil
justly
observes
jacob
grimm
foreign
to
all
primitive
religions
yet
professor
mueller
in
his
voluminous
work
on
those
of
america
after
approvingly
quoting
this
saying
complacently
proceeds
to
classify
the
deities
as
good
or
bad
spirits
this
view
which
has
obtained
without
question
in
earlier
works
on
the
native
religions
of
america
has
arisen
partly
from
habits
of
thought
difficult
to
break
partly
from
mistranslations
of
native
words
partly
from
the
foolish
axiom
of
the
early
missionaries
gods
of
the
gentiles
are
devils
yet
their
own
writings
furnish
conclusive
proof
that
no
such
distinction
existed
out
of
their
own
fancies
the
same
word
which
father
bruyas
employs
to
translate
into
iroquois
the
term
in
the
passage
devil
took
upon
himself
the
figure
of
a
serpent
he
is
obliged
to
use
for
in
the
phrase
the
resurrection
we
shall
be
spirits
which
is
a
rather
amusing
illustration
how
impossible
it
was
by
any
native
word
to
convey
the
idea
of
the
spirit
of
evil
when
in
father
rogel
commenced
his
labours
among
the
tribes
near
the
savannah
river
he
told
them
that
the
deity
they
adored
was
a
demon
who
loved
all
evil
things
and
they
must
hate
him
whereas
his
auditors
replied
that
so
far
from
this
being
the
case
he
whom
he
called
a
wicked
being
was
the
power
that
sent
them
all
good
things
and
indignantly
left
the
missionary
to
preach
to
the
winds
a
passage
often
quoted
in
support
of
this
mistaken
view
is
one
in
winslow
news
from
new
written
in
the
author
says
that
the
indians
worship
a
good
power
called
kiehtan
and
another
as
farre
as
wee
can
conceive
is
the
devill
named
hobbamock
or
hobbamoqui
the
former
of
these
names
is
merely
the
word
in
their
dialect
of
algonkin
with
a
final
and
is
probably
an
abbreviation
of
kittanitowit
the
great
manitou
a
vague
term
mentioned
by
roger
williams
and
other
early
writers
manufactured
probably
by
them
and
not
the
appellation
of
any
personified
deity
the
latter
so
far
from
corresponding
to
the
power
of
evil
was
according
to
winslow
own
statement
the
kindly
god
who
cured
diseases
aided
them
in
the
chase
and
appeared
to
them
in
dreams
as
their
protector
therefore
with
great
justice
jarvis
has
explained
it
to
mean
or
tutelary
deity
which
each
indian
worships
as
the
word
itself
signifies
so
in
many
instances
it
turns
out
that
what
has
been
reported
to
be
the
evil
divinity
of
a
nation
to
whom
they
pray
to
the
neglect
of
a
better
one
is
in
reality
the
highest
power
they
recognize
the
mythologies
of
the
red
man
are
infinitely
more
rich
in
creative
and
deluge
myths
than
those
of
any
other
race
in
the
two
hemispheres
tales
which
deal
with
the
origin
of
man
are
exceedingly
frequent
and
exhibit
every
phase
of
the
type
of
creative
story
although
many
of
these
are
similar
to
european
and
asiatic
myths
of
the
same
class
others
show
great
originality
and
strikingly
present
to
our
minds
the
characteristics
of
american
aboriginal
thought
the
of
the
various
indian
tribes
differ
as
much
from
one
another
as
do
those
of
europe
and
asia
in
some
we
find
the
great
gods
moulding
the
universe
in
others
we
find
them
merely
discovering
it
still
others
lead
their
people
from
subterranean
depths
to
the
upper
earth
in
many
indian
myths
we
find
the
world
produced
by
the
sun
who
thickens
the
clouds
into
water
which
becomes
the
sea
in
the
zuñi
record
of
creation
awonawilona
the
creator
fecundates
the
sea
with
his
own
flesh
and
hatches
it
with
his
own
heat
from
this
green
scums
are
formed
which
become
the
fourfold
mother
earth
and
the
father

from
whom
sprang
all
creatures
then
from
the
nethermost
of
the
four
caves
of
the
world
the
seed
of
men
and
the
creatures
took
form
and
grew
even
as
with
eggs
in
warm
places
worms
quickly
form
and
appear
and
growing
soon
burst
their
shells
and
there
emerge
as
may
happen
birds
tadpoles
or
serpents
so
man
and
all
creatures
grew
manifoldly
and
multiplied
in
many
kinds
thus
did
the
lowermost
become
overfilled
with
living
things
full
of
unfinished
creatures
crawling
like
reptiles
over
one
another
in
black
darkness
thickly
crowding
together
and
treading
one
on
another
one
spitting
on
another
and
doing
other
indecency
in
such
manner
that
the
murmurings
and
lamentations
became
loud
and
many
amidst
the
growing
confusion
sought
to
escape
growing
wiser
and
more
manlike
then
the
foremost
and
the
wisest
of
men
arising
from
the
nethermost
sea
came
among
men
and
the
living
things
and
pitying
them
obtained
egress
from
that
first
through
such
a
dark
and
narrow
path
that
some
seeing
somewhat
crowding
after
could
not
follow
him
so
eager
mightily
did
they
strive
one
with
another
alone
then
did
come
from
one
cave
to
another
into
this
world
then
lying
amidst
the
vast
wet
and
unstable
he
sought
and
found
the

besought
him
to
deliver
the
men
and
the
creatures
from
that
nethermost
world
cushing
bureau
of
american
ethnology
algonquian
in
many
other
indian
mythologies
we
find
the
wind
brooding
over
the
primeval
ocean
in
the
form
of
a
bird
in
some
amphibious
animals
dive
into
the
waters
and
bring
up
sufficient
mud
with
them
to
form
a
beginning
of
the
new
earth
in
a
number
of
these
tales
no
actual
act
of
creation
is
recorded
but
a
reconstruction
of
matter
only
the
algonquins
relate
that
their
great
god
michabo
when
hunting
one
day
with
wolves
for
dogs
was
surprised
to
see
the
animals
enter
a
great
lake
and
disappear
he
followed
them
into
the
waters
with
the
object
of
rescuing
them
but
as
he
did
so
the
lake
suddenly
overflowed
and
submerged
the
entire
earth
michabo
despatched
a
raven
with
directions
to
find
a
piece
of
earth
which
might
serve
as
a
nucleus
for
a
new
world
but
the
bird
returned
from
its
quest
unsuccessful
then
the
god
sent
an
otter
on
a
like
errand
but
it
too
failed
to
bring
back
the
needful
terrestrial
germ
at
last
a
was
sent
on
the
same
mission
and
it
returned
with
sufficient
earth
to
enable
michabo
to
recreate
the
solid
land
the
trees
had
become
denuded
of
their
branches
so
the
god
discharged
arrows
at
them
which
provided
them
with
new
boughs
after
this
michabo
married
the
and
from
their
union
sprang
the
human
race
the
muskhogean
the
muskhogean
indians
believe
that
in
the
beginning
the
primeval
waste
of
waters
alone
was
visible
over
the
dreary
expanse
two
pigeons
or
doves
flew
hither
and
thither
and
in
course
of
time
observed
a
single
blade
of
grass
spring
above
the
surface
the
solid
earth
followed
gradually
and
the
terrestrial
sphere
took
its
present
shape
a
great
hill
nunne
chaha
rose
in
the
midst
and
in
the
centre
of
this
was
the
house
of
the
deity
esaugetuh
emissee
the
of
breath
he
took
the
clay
which
surrounded
his
abode
and
from
it
moulded
the
first
men
and
as
the
waters
still
covered
the
earth
he
was
compelled
to
build
a
great
wall
upon
which
to
dry
the
folk
he
had
made
gradually
the
soft
mud
became
transformed
into
bone
and
flesh
and
esaugetuh
was
successful
in
directing
the
waters
into
their
proper
channels
reserving
the
dry
land
for
the
men
he
had
created
this
myth
closely
resembles
the
story
in
the
book
of
genesis
the
pigeons
appear
analogous
to
the
brooding
creative
spirit
and
the
manufacture
of
the
men
out
of
mud
is
also
striking
so
far
is
the
resemblance
carried
that
we
are
almost
forced
to
conclude
that
this
is
one
of
the
instances
in
which
gospel
conceptions
have
been
engrafted
on
a
native
legend
siouan
cosmology
the
mandan
tribes
of
the
sioux
possess
a
type
of
which
is
common
to
several
american
peoples
they
suppose
that
their
nation
lived
in
a
subterranean
village
near
a
vast
lake
hard
by
the
roots
of
a
great
penetrated
from
the
earth
above
and
clambering
up
these
several
of
them
got
a
sight
of
the
upper
world
which
they
found
to
be
rich
and
well
stocked
with
both
animal
and
vegetable
food
those
of
them
who
had
seen
the
world
above
returned
to
their
home
bringing
such
glowing
accounts
of
its
wealth
and
pleasantness
that
the
others
resolved
to
forsake
their
dreary
underground
dwelling
for
the
delights
of
the
sunny
sphere
above
the
entire
population
set
out
and
started
to
climb
up
the
roots
of
the
vine
but
no
more
than
half
the
tribe
had
ascended
when
the
plant
broke
owing
to
the
weight
of
a
corpulent
woman
the
mandans
imagine
that
after
death
they
will
return
to
the
underground
world
in
which
they
originally
dwelt
the
worthy
reaching
the
village
by
way
of
the
lake
the
bad
having
to
abandon
the
passage
by
reason
of
the
weight
of
their
sins
the
minnetarees
believed
that
their
original
ancestor
emerged
from
the
waters
of
a
lake
bearing
in
his
hand
an
ear
of
corn
and
the
mandans
possessed
a
myth
very
similar
to
that
of
the
muskhogees
concerning
the
origin
of
the
world
and
and
symbols
the
serpent
and
the
bird
appear
sometimes
separately
sometimes
in
strange
combination
in
north
american
mythology
the
bird
is
always
incomprehensible
to
the
savage
its
power
of
flight
its
appearance
in
the
heavens
where
dwell
the
gods
and
its
musical
song
combine
to
render
it
in
his
sight
a
being
of
mystery
possessing
capabilities
far
above
his
own
from
it
he
conceives
the
idea
of
the
winged
spirit
or
god
and
he
frequently
regards
it
as
a
messenger
from
the
bright
regions
of
the
sun
or
the
sky
deity
the
flight
and
song
of
birds
have
always
been
carefully
observed
by
primitive
people
as
omens
of
grave
import
these
superstitions
prevailed
among
the
red
race
no
less
than
among
our
own
early
ancestors
many
tribes
imagined
that
birds
were
the
visible
spirits
of
the
deceased
thus
the
powhatans
of
virginia
believed
that
the
feathered
race
received
the
souls
of
their
chiefs
at
death
and
they
were
careful
to
do
them
no
harm
accordingly
the
algonquins
believed
that
birds
caused
the
phenomenon
of
wind
that
they
created
and
that
the
clouds
were
the
spreading
and
agitation
of
their
wings
the
navaho
thought
that
a
great
white
swan
sat
at
each
of
the
four
points
of
the
compass
and
conjured
up
the
blasts
which
came
therefrom
while
the
dakotas
believed
that
in
the
west
is
the
home
of
the
wakinyjan
flyers
the
breezes
that
send
the
storms
the
thunder
too
is
regarded
by
some
indian
peoples
as
the
flapping
of
the
pinions
of
a
great
bird
whose
tracks
are
seen
in
the
lightning
like
the
sparks
which
the
buffalo
scatters
when
he
scours
over
a
stony
plain
many
of
the
tribes
of
the
coast
hold
the
same
belief
and
imagine
the
lightning
to
be
the
flash
of
the
eye
the
eagle
appears
to
have
been
regarded
with
extreme
veneration
by
the
red
man
of
the
north
its
feathers
composed
the
of
the
creeks
and
its
image
carved
in
wood
or
its
stuffed
skin
surmounted
their
council
lodges
none
but
an
approved
warrior
dared
wear
it
among
the
cherokees
and
the
dakotas
allowed
such
an
honour
only
to
him
who
had
first
touched
the
corpse
of
the
common
foe
the
natchez
and
other
tribes
esteemed
it
almost
as
a
deity
the
zuñi
of
new
mexico
employed
four
of
its
feathers
to
represent
the
four
winds
when
invoking
the
indeed
it
was
venerated
by
practically
every
tribe
in
north
america
the
owl
too
was
employed
as
a
symbol
of
wisdom
and
sometimes
as
by
the
algonquins
was
represented
as
the
attendant
of
the
lord
of
the
dead
the
creek
carried
a
stuffed
as
the
badge
of
their
fraternity
and
a
symbol
of
their
wisdom
and
the
cherokees
placed
one
above
the
stone
in
their
council
lodge
the
dove
also
appears
to
have
been
looked
upon
as
sacred
by
the
hurons
and
mandans
brinton
of
the
new
the
serpent
and
the
sun
some
indian
tribes
adopted
the
serpent
as
a
symbol
of
time
they
reckoned
by
and
as
the
outline
of
the
sun
a
circle
corresponds
to
nothing
in
nature
so
much
as
a
serpent
with
its
tail
in
its
mouth
devouring
itself
so
to
speak
this
may
have
been
the
origin
of
the
symbol
some
writers
think
that
the
serpent
symbolized
the
indian
idea
of
eternity
but
it
is
unlikely
that
such
a
recondite
conception
would
appeal
to
a
primitive
folk
the
lightning
serpent
among
the
indians
the
serpent
also
typified
the
lightning
the
rapidity
and
sinuosity
of
its
motions
its
quick
spring
and
sharp
recoil
prove
the
aptness
of
the
illustration
the
brilliancy
of
the
serpent
basilisk
glance
and
the
general
intelligence
of
its
habits
would
speedily
give
it
a
reputation
for
wisdom
and
therefore
as
the
possessor
of
or
magic
power
these
two
conceptions
would
shortly
become
fused
the
serpent
as
the
type
of
the
lightning
the
symbol
of
the
spear
of
the
would
lead
to
the
idea
that
that
deity
also
had
power
over
the
crops
or
summer
vegetation
for
it
is
at
the
time
of
year
when
lightning
is
most
prevalent
that
these
come
to
fruition
again
the
serpent
would
through
this
association
with
the
attain
a
significance
in
the
eye
of
warriors
who
would
regard
it
as
powerful
thus
the
horn
of
the
great
prince
of
serpents
which
was
supposed
to
dwell
in
the
great
lakes
was
thought
to
be
the
most
potent
obtainable
and
priests
or
professed
to
have
in
their
possession
fragments
of
this
mighty
talisman
the
algonquins
believed
that
the
lightning
was
an
immense
serpent
vomited
by
the
manito
or
creator
and
said
that
he
leaves
serpentine
twists
and
folds
on
the
trees
that
he
strikes
the
pawnees
called
the
thunder
the
hissing
of
the
great
snake
in
as
a
proof
of
magical
proficiency
as
typifying
the
lightning
which
as
the
of
the
brings
victory
in
battle
and
in
its
agricultural
connexion
lies
most
of
the
secret
of
the
potency
of
the
serpent
symbol
as
the
emblem
of
the
fertilizing
summer
showers
the
lightning
serpent
was
the
god
of
fruitfulness
but
as
the
forerunner
of
floods
and
disastrous
rains
it
was
feared
and
dreaded
probably
more
ponderous
nonsense
has
been
written
about
the
worship
of
reptiles
as
the
mythologists
of
half
a
century
ago
termed
it
than
upon
any
other
allied
subject
but
this
notwithstanding
there
is
no
question
that
the
serpent
still
holds
a
high
place
in
the
superstitious
regard
of
many
peoples
asiatic
and
american
as
we
have
already
seen
it
frequently
represents
the
orb
of
day
and
this
is
especially
the
case
among
the
zuñi
and
other
tribes
of
the
southern
portions
of
north
america
where
is
more
usual
than
in
the
less
genial
regions
with
the
red
man
also
it
commonly
typified
water
the
sinuous
motion
of
the
reptile
sufficiently
accounts
for
its
adoption
as
the
symbol
for
this
element
and
it
would
be
no
difficult
feat
of
imagination
for
the
savage
to
regard
the
serpent
as
a
bearing
in
mind
as
he
would
the
resemblance
between
its
movement
and
the
winding
course
of
a
river
kennebec
the
name
of
a
stream
in
maine
means
and
antietam
a
creek
in
maryland
has
the
same
significance
in
the
iroquois
dialect
both
algonquins
and
iroquois
believed
in
the
mighty
serpent
of
the
great
lakes
the
wrath
of
this
deity
was
greatly
to
be
feared
and
it
was
thought
that
unless
duly
placated
he
vented
his
irascible
temper
upon
the
foolhardy
adventurers
who
dared
to
approach
his
domain
by
raising
a
tempest
or
breaking
the
ice
beneath
their
feet
and
dragging
them
down
to
his
dismal
fastnesses
beneath
the
rattlesnake
the
rattlesnake
was
the
serpent
almost
exclusively
honoured
by
the
red
race
it
is
slow
to
attack
but
venomous
in
the
extreme
and
possesses
the
power
of
the
basilisk
to
attract
within
reach
of
its
spring
small
birds
and
squirrels
it
has
the
same
strange
susceptibility
to
the
influence
of
rhythmic
sounds
as
the
vipers
in
which
lies
the
secret
of
most
of
the
indian
magicians
were
familiar
with
this
singularity
they
employed
it
with
telling
effect
to
put
beyond
question
their
intercourse
with
the
unseen
powers
and
to
vindicate
the
potency
of
their
own
guardian
spirits
who
thus
enabled
them
to
handle
with
impunity
the
most
venomous
of
reptiles
the
antipathy
of
these
serpents
to
certain
plants
for
instance
the
hazel
which
bound
around
the
ankles
is
an
alleged
protection
against
their
attacks
and
perhaps
some
antidote
to
their
poison
used
by
the
magicians
led
to
their
frequent
introduction
in
religious
ceremonies
such
exhibitions
must
have
made
a
profound
impression
on
the
spectators
and
redounded
in
a
corresponding
degree
to
the
glory
of
the
performer
is
a
asks
the
mystic
meda
chant
of
the
algonkins
is
the
reply
who
walketh
with
a
serpent
walking
on
the
ground
he
is
a
the
intimate
alliance
of
this
symbol
with
the
mysteries
of
religion
the
darkest
riddles
of
the
unknown
is
reflected
in
their
language
and
also
in
that
of
their
neighbours
the
dakotas
in
both
of
which
the
same
words
which
express
the
supernatural
in
its
broadest
sense
are
also
used
as
terms
for
this
species
of
animals
the
pious
founder
of
the
moravian
brotherhood
the
count
of
zinzendorf
owed
his
life
on
one
occasion
to
this
deeply
rooted
superstition
he
was
visiting
a
missionary
station
among
the
shawnees
in
the
wyoming
valley
recent
quarrels
with
the
whites
had
unusually
irritated
this
unruly
folk
and
they
resolved
to
make
him
their
first
victim
after
he
had
retired
to
his
secluded
hut
several
of
the
braves
crept
upon
him
and
cautiously
lifting
the
corner
of
the
lodge
peered
in
the
venerable
man
was
seated
before
a
little
fire
a
volume
of
the
scriptures
on
his
knees
lost
in
the
perusal
of
the
sacred
words
while
they
gazed
a
huge
rattlesnake
unnoticed
by
him
trailed
across
his
feet
and
rolled
itself
into
a
coil
in
the
comfortable
warmth
of
the
fire
immediately
the
murderers
forsook
their
purpose
and
noiselessly
retired
convinced
that
this
was
indeed
a
man
of
god
brinton
of
the
new
pp
the
sacred
origin
of
smoking
smoking
is
of
course
originally
an
american
custom
and
with
the
indians
of
north
america
possesses
a
sacred
origin
says
an
authority
upon
the
barbarian
use
of
tobacco
schoolcraft
of
the
sacred
origin
of
tobacco
the
indian
has
no
doubt
although
scarcely
two
tribes
exactly
agree
in
the
details
of
the
way
in
which
the
invaluable
boon
was
conferred
on
man
in
substance
however
the
legend
is
the
same
with
all
ages
ago
at
the
time
when
spirits
considered
the
world
yet
good
enough
for
their
occasional
residence
a
very
great
and
powerful
spirit
lay
down
by
the
side
of
his
fire
to
sleep
in
the
forest
while
so
lying
his
came
that
way
and
thought
it
would
be
a
good
chance
for
mischief
so
gently
approaching
the
sleeper
he
rolled
him
over
toward
the
fire
till
his
head
rested
among
the
glowing
embers
and
his
hair
was
set
ablaze
the
roaring
of
the
fire
in
his
ears
roused
the
good
spirit
and
leaping
to
his
feet
he
rushed
in
a
fright
through
the
forest
and
as
he
did
so
the
wind
caught
his
singed
hair
as
it
flew
off
and
carrying
it
away
sowed
it
broadcast
over
the
earth
into
which
it
sank
and
took
root
and
grew
up
tobacco
if
anything
exceeds
the
savage
belief
in
tobacco
it
is
that
which
attaches
to
his
pipe
in
life
it
is
his
dearest
companion
and
in
death
is
inseparable
for
whatever
else
may
be
forgotten
at
his
funeral
obsequies
his
pipe
is
laid
in
the
grave
with
him
to
solace
him
on
his
journey
to
the
first
pipe
is
among
the
most
sacred
of
their
traditions
as
well
it
may
be
when
it
is
sincerely
believed
that
no
other
than
the
great
spirit
himself
was
the
original
smoker
many
years
ago
the
great
spirit
called
all
his
people
together
and
standing
on
the
precipice
of
the
red
rock
he
broke
a
piece
from
the
wall
and
kneading
it
in
his
hands
made
a
huge
pipe
which
he
smoked
over
them
and
to
the
north
south
east
and
west
he
told
them
that
this
stone
was
red
that
it
was
their
flesh
that
of
it
they
might
make
their
pipes
of
peace
but
it
belonged
equally
to
all
and
the
and
the
must
not
be
raised
on
this
ground
and
he
smoked
his
pipe
and
talked
to
them
till
the
last
whiff
and
then
his
head
disappeared
in
a
cloud
and
immediately
the
whole
surface
of
the
rock
for
several
miles
was
melted
and
glazed
two
great
ovens
were
opened
beneath
and
two
women
guardian
spirits
of
the
place
entered
them
in
a
blaze
of
fire
and
they
are
heard
there
yet
and
answer
to
the
invocation
of
the
priests
or
who
consult
them
on
their
visits
to
this
sacred
place
the
place
here
mentioned
is
the
site
of
the
quarry
from
this
place
has
the
north
american
indian
ever
obtained
material
for
his
pipe
and
from
no
other
spot
catlin
asserts
that
in
every
tribe
he
has
visited
numbering
about
forty
and
extending
over
thousands
of
miles
of
country
the
pipes
have
all
been
made
of
this
red
clarke
the
great
american
traveller
relates
that
in
his
intercourse
with
many
tribes
who
as
yet
had
had
but
little
intercourse
with
the
whites
he
learned
that
almost
every
adult
had
made
the
pilgrimage
to
the
sacred
rock
and
drawn
from
thence
his
so
peculiar
is
this
that
catlin
has
been
at
the
pains
to
describe
it
very
fully
and
graphically
and
from
his
account
the
following
is
taken
approach
to
it
was
from
the
east
and
the
ascent
for
the
distance
of
fifty
miles
over
a
continued
succession
of
slopes
and
terraces
almost
imperceptibly
rising
one
above
another
that
seemed
to
lift
us
to
a
great
height
there
is
not
a
tree
or
bush
to
be
seen
from
the
highest
summit
of
the
ridge
though
the
eye
may
range
east
and
west
almost
to
a
boundless
extent
over
a
surface
covered
with
a
short
grass
that
is
green
at
one
feet
and
about
him
but
changing
to
blue
in
distance
like
nothing
but
the
blue
and
vastness
of
the
ocean
the
very
top
of
this
mound
or
ridge
we
found
the
quarry
or
fountain
of
the
red
pipe
which
is
truly
an
anomaly
in
nature
the
principal
and
most
striking
feature
of
this
place
is
a
perpendicular
wall
of
compact
quartz
of
and
thirty
feet
in
elevation
running
nearly
north
and
south
with
its
face
to
the
west
exhibiting
a
front
of
nearly
two
miles
in
length
when
it
disappears
at
both
ends
by
running
under
the
prairie
which
becomes
there
a
little
more
elevated
and
probably
covers
it
for
many
miles
both
to
the
north
and
south
the
depression
of
the
brow
of
the
ridge
at
this
place
has
been
caused
by
the
wash
of
a
little
stream
produced
by
several
springs
at
the
top
a
little
back
from
the
wall
which
has
gradually
carried
away
the
superincumbent
earth
and
having
bared
the
wall
for
the
distance
of
two
miles
is
now
left
to
glide
for
some
distance
over
a
perfectly
level
surface
of
quartz
rock
and
then
to
leap
from
the
top
of
the
wall
into
a
deep
basin
below
and
thence
seek
its
course
to
the
missouri
forming
the
extreme
source
of
a
noted
and
powerful
tributary
called
the
big
sioux
the
base
of
this
wall
there
is
a
level
prairie
of
half
a
mile
in
width
running
parallel
to
it
in
any
and
in
all
parts
of
which
the
indians
procure
the
red
stone
for
their
pipes
by
digging
through
the
soil
and
several
slaty
layers
of
the
red
stone
to
the
depth
of
four
or
five
feet
from
the
very
numerous
marks
of
ancient
and
modern
diggings
or
excavations
it
would
appear
that
this
place
has
been
for
many
centuries
resorted
to
for
the
red
stone
and
from
the
great
number
of
graves
and
remains
of
ancient
fortifications
in
the
vicinity
it
would
seem
as
well
as
from
their
actual
traditions
that
the
indian
tribes
have
long
held
this
place
in
high
superstitious
estimation
and
also
that
it
has
been
the
resort
of
different
tribes
who
have
made
their
regular
pilgrimages
here
to
renew
their
pipes
as
far
as
may
be
gathered
from
the
various
and
slightly
conflicting
accounts
of
indian
smoking
observances
it
would
seem
that
to
every
tribe
or
if
it
be
an
extensive
one
to
every
detachment
of
a
tribe
belongs
a
potent
instrument
known
as
it
is
nothing
more
than
a
splendidly
adorned
with
savage
trappings
yet
it
is
regarded
as
a
sacred
thing
to
be
used
only
on
the
most
solemn
occasions
or
in
the
transaction
of
such
important
business
as
among
us
could
only
be
concluded
by
the
sanction
of
a
cabinet
council
and
affixing
the
royal
signature
the
gods
of
the
red
man
most
of
the
north
american
stocks
possessed
a
regular
pantheon
of
deities
of
these
having
regard
to
their
numbers
it
will
be
impossible
to
speak
in
any
detail
and
it
will
be
sufficient
if
we
confine
ourselves
to
some
account
of
the
more
outstanding
figures
as
in
all
mythologies
godhead
is
often
attached
to
the
conception
of
the
bringer
of
culture
the
sapient
being
who
first
instructs
mankind
in
the
arts
of
life
agriculture
and
religion
american
mythologies
possess
many
such
and
it
is
not
always
easy
to
say
whether
they
belong
to
history
or
mythology
of
course
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
conception
of
some
of
these
beings
prove
that
they
can
be
nothing
else
than
mythological
but
without
doubt
some
of
them
were
originally
mere
mortal
heroes
michabo
we
discover
one
of
the
first
class
in
michabo
the
great
hare
the
principal
deity
of
the
algonquins
in
the
accounts
of
the
older
travellers
we
find
him
described
as
the
ruler
of
the
winds
the
inventor
of
and
even
the
creator
and
preserver
of
the
world
taking
a
grain
of
sand
from
the
bed
of
the
ocean
he
made
from
it
an
island
which
he
launched
in
the
primeval
waters
this
island
speedily
grew
to
a
great
size
indeed
so
extensive
did
it
become
that
a
young
wolf
which
managed
to
find
a
footing
on
it
and
attempted
to
cross
it
died
of
old
age
before
he
completed
his
journey
a
great
society
called
meda
was
supposed
to
have
been
founded
by
michabo
many
were
his
inventions
observing
the
spider
spread
its
web
he
devised
the
art
of
knitting
nets
to
catch
fish
he
furnished
the
hunter
with
many
signs
and
charms
for
use
in
the
chase
in
the
autumn
ere
he
takes
his
winter
sleep
he
fills
his
great
pipe
and
smokes
and
the
smoke
which
arises
is
seen
in
the
clouds
which
fill
the
air
with
the
haze
of
the
indian
summer
some
uncertainty
prevailed
among
the
various
algonquian
tribes
as
to
where
michabo
resided
some
of
them
believing
that
he
dwelt
on
an
island
in
lake
superior
others
on
an
iceberg
in
the
arctic
ocean
and
still
others
in
the
firmament
but
the
prevalent
idea
seems
to
have
been
that
his
home
was
in
the
east
where
the
sun
rises
on
the
shores
of
the
great
river
ocean
that
surrounds
the
dry
land
that
a
being
possessing
such
qualities
should
be
conceived
of
as
taking
the
name
and
form
of
a
timid
animal
like
the
hare
is
indeed
curious
and
there
is
little
doubt
that
the
original
root
from
which
the
name
michabo
has
been
formed
does
not
signify
in
fact
the
root
which
is
the
initial
syllable
of
the
algonquian
word
for
means
also
and
from
it
are
derived
the
words
for
and
their
names
proceeding
from
the
same
root
the
idea
of
the
hare
and
the
dawn
became
confused
and
the
more
tangible
object
became
the
symbol
of
the
god
michabo
was
therefore
the
spirit
of
light
and
as
the
dawn
the
bringer
of
winds
as
lord
of
light
he
is
also
wielder
of
the
lightning
he
is
in
constant
strife
nevertheless
with
his
father
the
west
wind
and
in
this
combat
we
can
see
the
diurnal
struggle
between
east
and
west
light
and
darkness
common
to
so
many
mythologies
modern
indian
tales
concerning
michabo
make
him
a
mere
tricksy
spirit
a
malicious
buffoon
but
in
these
we
can
see
his
character
in
process
of
deterioration
under
the
stress
of
modern
conditions
impinging
upon
indian
life
it
is
in
the
tales
of
the
old
travellers
and
missionaries
that
we
find
him
in
his
true
colours
as
a
great
lord
of
the
day
and
bringer
of
light
and
civilization
the
battle
of
the
among
the
iroquois
we
find
a
similar
myth
it
tells
of
two
brothers
ioskeha
and
tawiscara
or
the
white
one
and
the
dark
one
twins
whose
grandmother
was
the
moon
when
they
grew
up
they
quarrelled
violently
with
one
another
and
finally
came
to
blows
ioskeha
took
as
his
weapon
the
horns
of
a
stag
while
tawiscara
seized
a
wild
rose
to
defend
himself
the
latter
proved
but
a
puny
weapon
and
sorely
wounded
tawiscara
turned
to
fly
the
drops
of
blood
which
fell
from
him
became
flint
stones
ioskeha
later
built
for
himself
a
lodge
in
the
far
east
and
became
the
father
of
mankind
and
principal
deity
of
the
iroquois
slaying
the
monsters
which
infested
the
earth
stocking
the
woods
with
game
teaching
the
indians
how
to
grow
crops
and
make
fires
and
instructing
them
in
many
of
the
other
arts
of
life
this
myth
appears
to
have
been
accepted
later
by
the
mohawks
and
tuscaroras
awonawilona
we
have
already
alluded
in
the
zuñi
to
the
native
deity
awonawilona
this
god
stands
out
as
one
of
the
most
perfect
examples
of
deity
in
its
constructive
aspect
to
be
found
in
the
mythologies
of
america
he
seems
in
some
measure
to
be
identified
with
the
sun
and
from
the
remote
allusions
regarding
him
and
the
manner
in
which
he
is
spoken
of
as
an
architect
of
the
universe
we
gather
that
he
was
not
exactly
in
close
touch
with
mankind
ahsonnutli
closely
resembling
him
was
ahsonnutli
the
principal
deity
of
the
navaho
indians
of
new
mexico
who
was
regarded
as
the
creator
of
the
heavens
and
earth
he
was
supposed
to
have
placed
twelve
men
at
each
of
the
cardinal
points
to
uphold
the
heavens
he
was
believed
to
possess
the
qualities
of
both
sexes
and
is
entitled
the
turquoise
atius
tiráwa
atius
tiráwa
was
the
great
god
of
the
pawnees
he
also
was
a
creative
deity
and
ordered
the
courses
of
the
sun
moon
and
stars
as
known
he
is
regarded
as
omnipotent
and
intangible
but
how
far
this
conception
of
him
has
been
coloured
by
missionary
influence
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
we
find
however
in
other
indian
mythologies
which
we
know
have
not
been
sophisticated
by
christian
belief
many
references
to
deities
who
possess
such
attributes
and
there
is
no
reason
why
we
should
infer
that
atius
tiráwa
is
any
other
than
a
purely
aboriginal
conception
esaugetuh
emissee
the
great
god
of
the
creeks
and
other
muskhogeans
was
esaugetuh
emissee
whose
name
signifies
of
breath
the
sound
of
the
name
represents
the
emission
of
breath
from
the
mouth
he
was
the
god
of
wind
and
like
many
another
divinity
in
american
mythology
his
rule
over
that
element
was
allied
with
his
power
over
the
breath
of
life
one
of
the
forms
of
wind
or
air
savage
man
regards
the
wind
as
the
great
source
of
breath
and
life
indeed
in
many
tongues
the
words
and
have
a
common
origin
we
find
a
like
conception
in
the
aztec
tezcatlipoca
who
was
looked
upon
as
the
primary
source
of
existence
see
the
author
of
mexico
and
in
this
series
the
coyote
god
among
the
people
of
the
far
west
the
californians
and
chinooks
an
outstanding
deity
is
strangely
enough
the
coyote
but
whereas
among
the
chinooks
he
was
thought
to
be
a
benign
being
the
maidu
and
other
californian
tribes
pictured
him
as
mischievous
cunning
and
destructive
kodoyanpe
the
maidu
creator
discovered
the
world
along
with
coyote
and
with
his
aid
rendered
it
habitable
for
mankind
the
pair
fashioned
men
out
of
small
wooden
images
as
the
gods
of
the
kiche
of
central
america
are
related
to
have
done
in
the
myth
in
the
but
the
mannikins
proved
unsuitable
to
their
purpose
and
they
turned
them
into
animals
kodoyanpe
intentions
were
beneficent
and
as
matters
appeared
to
be
going
but
ill
he
concluded
that
coyote
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
mischief
in
this
he
was
correct
and
on
consideration
he
resolved
to
destroy
coyote
on
the
side
of
the
disturber
was
a
formidable
array
of
monsters
and
other
evil
agencies
but
kodoyanpe
received
powerful
assistance
from
a
being
called
the
conqueror
who
rid
the
universe
of
many
monsters
and
wicked
spirits
which
might
have
proved
unfriendly
to
the
life
of
man
as
yet
unborn
the
combat
raged
fiercely
over
a
protracted
period
but
at
last
the
beneficent
kodoyanpe
was
defeated
by
the
crafty
coyote
kodoyanpe
had
buried
many
of
the
wooden
mannikins
whom
he
had
at
first
created
and
they
now
sprang
from
their
places
and
became
the
indian
race
this
is
of
course
a
or
myth
kodoyanpe
is
the
sun
the
spirit
of
day
who
after
a
diurnal
struggle
with
the
forces
of
darkness
flies
toward
the
west
for
refuge
coyote
is
the
spirit
of
night
typified
by
an
animal
of
nocturnal
habits
which
slinks
forth
from
its
den
as
the
shades
of
dusk
fall
on
the
land
we
find
a
similar
conception
in
egyptian
mythology
where
anubis
the
swallows
his
father
osiris
the
brilliant
god
of
day
as
the
night
swallows
up
the
sun
another
version
of
the
coyote
myth
current
in
california
describes
how
in
the
beginning
there
was
only
the
primeval
waste
of
waters
upon
which
kodoyanpe
and
coyote
dropped
in
a
canoe
coyote
willed
that
the
surf
beneath
them
should
become
sand
coyote
was
coming
he
came
to
there
he
met
a
heavy
surf
he
was
afraid
that
he
might
be
drifted
away
and
went
up
to
the
he
stayed
there
a
long
time
then
he
took
some
sand
and
threw
it
upon
that
surf
shall
be
a
prairie
and
no
surf
the
future
generations
shall
walk
on
this
prairie
thus
clatsop
became
a
prairie
the
surf
became
a
prairie
boas
but
among
other
tribes
as
well
as
among
the
chinooks
italapas
the
coyote
is
a
beneficent
deity
thus
in
the
myths
of
the
shushwap
and
kutenai
indians
of
british
columbia
he
figures
as
the
creative
agency
and
in
the
of
the
ashochimi
of
california
he
appears
after
the
deluge
and
plants
in
the
earth
the
feathers
of
various
birds
which
according
to
their
colour
become
the
several
indian
tribes
blue
jay
another
mischievous
deity
of
the
chinooks
and
other
western
peoples
is
blue
jay
he
is
a
turbulent
braggart
schemer
and
he
is
the
very
clown
of
gods
and
invariably
in
trouble
himself
if
he
is
not
manufacturing
it
for
others
he
has
the
shape
of
a
which
was
given
him
by
the
supernatural
people
because
he
lost
to
them
in
an
archery
contest
they
placed
a
curse
upon
him
telling
him
the
note
he
used
as
a
bird
would
gain
an
unenviable
notoriety
as
a
bad
omen
blue
jay
has
an
elder
brother
the
robin
who
is
continually
upbraiding
him
for
his
mischievous
conduct
in
sententious
phraseology
the
story
of
the
many
tricks
and
pranks
played
by
blue
jay
not
only
on
the
members
of
his
tribe
but
also
upon
the
denizens
of
the
supernatural
world
must
have
afforded
intense
amusement
around
many
an
indian
even
the
proverbial
gravity
of
the
red
man
could
scarcely
hold
out
against
the
comical
adventures
of
this
american
north
america
is
rich
in
of
these
a
typical
example
is
haokah
the
god
of
the
sioux
the
countenance
of
this
divinity
was
divided
into
halves
one
of
which
expressed
grief
and
the
other
cheerfulness
that
is
on
occasion
he
could
either
weep
with
the
rain
or
smile
with
the
sun
heat
affected
him
as
cold
and
cold
was
to
him
as
heat
he
beat
the
tattoo
of
the
thunder
on
his
great
drum
using
the
wind
as
a
in
some
phases
he
is
reminiscent
of
jupiter
for
he
hurls
the
lightning
to
earth
in
the
shape
of
thunderbolts
he
wears
a
pair
of
horns
perhaps
to
typify
his
connexion
with
the
lightning
or
else
with
the
chase
for
many
american
are
mighty
hunters
this
double
conception
arises
from
their
possession
of
the
or
arrow
which
also
gives
them
in
some
cases
the
character
of
a
strangely
enough
such
gods
of
the
chase
often
resembled
in
appearance
the
animals
they
hunted
for
example
tsui
slanting
eyes
a
of
the
cherokee
indians
seems
to
resemble
a
deer
he
is
of
giant
proportions
and
dwells
in
a
great
mountain
of
the
blue
ridge
range
in
virginia
he
appears
to
have
possessed
all
the
game
in
the
district
as
his
private
property
a
cherokee
is
asgaya
gigagei
red
man
the
facts
that
he
is
described
as
being
of
a
red
colour
thus
typifying
the
lightning
and
that
the
cherokees
were
originally
a
mountain
people
leave
little
room
for
doubt
that
he
is
a
for
it
is
around
the
mountain
peaks
that
the
heavy
gather
and
the
red
lightning
flashing
from
their
depths
looks
like
the
moving
limbs
of
the
deity
we
also
find
occasionally
invoked
in
the
cherokee
religious
formulæ
a
pair
of
twin
deities
known
as
the
men
or
this
reminds
us
that
in
peru
twins
were
always
regarded
as
sacred
to
the
lightning
since
they
were
emblematic
of
the
twins
apocatequil
and
piguerao
all
these
are
analogous
to
the
aztec
tlaloc
the
kiche
hurakan
and
the
otomi
mixcoatl
a
instance
of
the
or
who
possesses
animal
characteristics
will
occur
to
those
who
are
familiar
with
the
old
english
legend
of
herne
the
hunter
with
his
deer
head
and
antlers
see
of
mexico
and
the
dakota
indians
worshipped
a
deity
whom
they
addressed
as
waukheon
this
being
was
engaged
in
constant
strife
with
the
unktahe
who
was
a
cunning
sorcerer
and
a
controller
of
dreams
and
witchcraft
their
conflict
probably
symbolizes
the
atmospheric
changes
which
accompany
the
different
seasons
idea
of
a
future
life
the
idea
of
a
future
life
was
very
widely
disseminated
among
the
tribes
of
north
america
the
general
conception
of
such
an
existence
was
that
it
was
merely
a
shadowy
extension
of
terrestrial
life
in
which
the
same
round
of
hunting
and
kindred
pursuits
was
engaged
in
the
indian
idea
of
eternal
bliss
seems
to
have
been
an
existence
in
the
land
of
the
sun
to
which
however
only
those
famed
in
war
were
usually
admitted
that
the
indians
possessed
a
firm
belief
in
a
future
state
of
existence
is
proved
by
their
statements
to
the
early
moravian
missionaries
to
whom
they
said
we
indians
shall
not
for
ever
die
even
the
grains
of
corn
we
put
under
the
earth
grow
up
and
become
living
things
the
old
missionary
adds
they
conceive
that
when
the
soul
has
been
awhile
with
god
it
can
if
it
chooses
return
to
earth
and
be
born
again
this
idea
of
rebirth
however
appears
to
have
meant
that
the
soul
would
return
to
the
bones
that
these
would
clothe
themselves
with
flesh
and
that
the
man
would
rejoin
his
tribe
by
what
process
of
reasoning
they
arrived
at
such
a
conclusion
it
would
be
difficult
to
ascertain
but
the
almost
universal
practice
which
obtained
among
the
indians
both
of
north
and
south
america
of
preserving
the
bones
of
the
deceased
plainly
indicates
that
they
possessed
some
strong
religious
reason
for
this
belief
many
tribes
which
dwelt
east
of
the
mississippi
once
in
every
decade
collected
the
bones
of
those
who
had
died
within
that
period
carefully
cleaned
them
and
placed
them
in
a
tomb
lined
with
beautiful
flowers
over
which
they
erected
a
mound
of
wood
stone
or
earth
nor
indeed
were
the
ancient
egyptians
more
considerate
of
the
remains
of
their
fathers
the
hope
of
resurrection
american
funerary
ritual
and
practice
throughout
the
northern
plainly
indicates
a
strong
and
vivid
belief
in
the
resurrection
of
the
soul
after
death
among
many
tribes
the
practice
prevailed
of
interring
with
the
deceased
such
objects
as
he
might
be
supposed
to
require
in
the
other
world
these
included
weapons
of
war
and
of
the
chase
for
men
and
household
implements
and
feminine
finery
in
the
case
of
women
among
primitive
peoples
the
belief
is
prevalent
that
inanimate
objects
possess
doubles
or
as
spiritualists
would
say
bodies
or
souls
and
some
indian
tribes
supposed
that
unless
such
objects
were
broken
or
mutilated
that
is
to
say
their
doubles
would
not
accompany
the
spirit
of
the
deceased
on
its
journey
indian
burial
customs
many
methods
of
disposing
of
the
corpse
were
and
are
in
use
among
the
american
indians
the
most
common
of
these
were
ordinary
burial
in
the
earth
or
under
tumuli
burial
in
caves
raising
the
dead
on
platforms
and
the
disposal
of
cremated
remains
in
urns
embalming
and
mummification
were
practised
to
a
certain
extent
by
some
of
the
extinct
tribes
of
the
east
coast
and
some
of
the
tribes
notably
the
chinooks
buried
their
dead
in
canoes
which
were
raised
on
poles
the
rites
which
accompanied
burial
besides
the
placing
of
useful
articles
and
food
in
the
grave
generally
consisted
in
a
solemn
dance
in
which
the
bereaved
relatives
cut
themselves
and
blackened
their
faces
after
which
they
wailed
night
and
morning
in
solitary
places
it
was
generally
regarded
as
unlucky
to
mention
the
name
of
the
deceased
and
indeed
the
bereaved
family
often
adopted
another
name
to
avoid
such
a
contingency
the
soul
journey
most
of
the
tribes
appear
to
have
believed
that
the
soul
had
to
undertake
a
long
journey
before
it
reached
its
destination
the
belief
of
the
chinooks
in
this
respect
is
perhaps
a
typical
one
they
imagine
that
after
death
the
spirit
of
the
deceased
drinks
at
a
large
hole
in
the
ground
after
which
it
shrinks
and
passes
on
to
the
country
of
the
ghosts
where
it
is
fed
with
spirit
food
and
drink
after
this
act
of
communion
with
the
it
may
not
return
they
also
believe
that
every
one
is
possessed
of
two
spirits
a
greater
and
a
less
during
illness
the
lesser
soul
is
spirited
away
by
the
denizens
of
the
navahos
possess
a
similar
belief
and
say
that
the
soul
has
none
of
the
vital
force
which
animates
the
body
nor
any
of
the
faculties
of
the
mind
but
a
kind
of
third
quality
or
personality
like
the
of
the
ancient
egyptians
which
may
leave
its
owner
and
become
lost
much
to
his
danger
and
discomfort
the
hurons
and
iroquois
believe
that
after
death
the
soul
must
cross
a
deep
and
swift
stream
by
a
bridge
formed
by
a
single
slender
tree
upon
which
it
has
to
combat
the
attacks
of
a
fierce
dog
the
athapascans
imagine
that
the
soul
must
be
ferried
over
a
great
water
in
a
stone
canoe
and
the
algonquins
and
dakotas
believe
that
departed
spirits
must
cross
a
stream
bridged
by
an
enormous
snake
paradise
and
the
supernatural
people
the
red
man
appears
to
have
possessed
two
wholly
different
conceptions
of
supernatural
life
we
find
in
indian
myth
allusions
both
to
a
of
the
ghosts
and
to
a
of
the
supernatural
people
the
first
appears
to
be
the
destination
of
human
beings
after
death
but
the
second
is
apparently
the
of
a
spiritual
race
some
degrees
higher
than
mankind
both
these
regions
are
within
the
reach
of
mortals
and
seem
to
be
mere
extensions
of
the
terrestrial
sphere
their
inhabitants
eat
drink
hunt
and
amuse
themselves
in
the
same
manner
as
earthly
folk
and
are
by
no
means
invulnerable
or
immortal
the
instinctive
dread
of
the
supernatural
which
primitive
man
possesses
is
well
exemplified
in
the
myths
in
which
he
is
brought
into
contact
with
the
denizens
of
or
the
these
myths
were
undoubtedly
framed
for
the
same
purpose
as
the
old
welsh
poem
on
the
harrying
of
hell
or
the
story
of
the
journey
of
the
twin
brothers
to
xibalba
in
the
central
american
that
is
to
say
the
desire
was
felt
for
some
assurance
that
man
on
entering
the
spiritual
sphere
would
only
be
treading
in
the
footsteps
of
heroic
beings
who
had
preceded
him
who
had
vanquished
the
forces
of
death
and
hell
and
had
stripped
them
of
their
terrors
the
mythologies
of
the
north
american
indians
possess
no
place
of
punishment
any
more
than
they
possess
any
deities
who
are
frankly
malevolent
toward
humanity
should
a
place
of
torment
be
discernible
in
any
indian
mythology
at
the
present
day
it
may
unhesitatingly
be
classed
as
the
product
of
missionary
sophistication
father
brébeuf
an
early
french
missionary
could
only
find
that
the
souls
of
suicides
and
those
killed
in
war
were
supposed
to
dwell
apart
from
the
others
but
as
to
the
souls
of
scoundrels
he
adds
so
far
from
being
shut
out
they
are
welcome
guests
though
for
that
matter
if
it
were
not
so
their
paradise
would
be
a
total
desert
as
and
are
one
and
the
same
the
sacred
number
four
over
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
american
continent
a
peculiar
sanctity
is
attached
by
the
aborigines
to
the
four
points
of
the
compass
this
arises
from
the
circumstance
that
from
these
quarters
come
the
winds
which
carry
the
fertilizing
rains
the
red
man
a
dweller
in
vast
undulating
plains
where
landmarks
are
few
recognized
the
necessity
of
such
guidance
in
his
wanderings
as
could
alone
be
received
from
a
strict
adherence
to
the
position
of
the
four
cardinal
points
these
he
began
to
regard
with
veneration
as
his
personal
safeguards
and
recognized
in
them
the
of
powerful
beings
under
whose
care
he
was
most
of
his
festivals
and
celebrations
had
symbolical
or
direct
allusions
to
the
four
points
of
the
compass
the
ceremony
of
smoking
without
which
no
treaty
could
be
commenced
or
ratified
was
usually
begun
by
the
chief
of
the
tribe
exhaling
toward
the
four
quarters
of
the
earth
among
some
tribes
other
points
were
also
recognized
as
for
example
one
in
the
sky
and
one
in
the
earth
all
these
points
had
their
symbolical
colours
and
were
presided
over
by
various
animal
or
other
divinities
thus
the
apaches
took
black
for
the
east
white
for
the
south
yellow
for
the
west

for

the

indian
time
and
festivals
the
north
american
tribes
have
various
ways
of
computing
time
some
of
them
rely
merely
upon
the
changes
in
season
and
the
growth
of
crops
for
guidance
as
to
when
their
annual
festivals
and
seasonal
celebrations
should
take
place
others
fix
their
system
of
festivals
on
the
changes
of
the
moon
and
the
habits
of
animals
and
birds
it
was
however
upon
the
moon
that
most
of
these
peoples
depended
for
information
regarding
the
passage
of
time
most
of
them
assigned
twelve
moons
to
the
year
while
others
considered
thirteen
a
more
correct
number
the
kiowa
reckoned
the
year
to
consist
of
twelve
and
a
half
moons
the
other
half
being
carried
over
to
the
year
following
the
zuñi
of
new
mexico
allude
to
the
year
as
a
of
time
and
call
the
seasons
the
of
the
year
the
first
six
months
of
the
zuñi
year
possess
names
which
have
an
agricultural
or
natural
significance
while
the
last
six
have
ritualistic
names
captain
jonathan
carver
who
travelled
among
the
sioux
at
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
says
that
some
tribes
among
them
reckoned
their
years
by
moons
and
made
them
consist
of
twelve
lunar
months
observing
when
thirty
moons
had
waned
to
add
a
supernumerary
one
which
they
termed
the
moon
they
gave
a
name
to
each

these
people
had
no
division
into

but
counted
days
by
by
pointing
to
the
sun
at
noon
and
by
the
rising
and
setting
of
the
sun
for
all
of
which
they
possessed

many

kept
records
of

no
one
but
the
persons
who
mark
them
can
understand
the
chief
reason
for
the
computation
of
time
among
savage
peoples
is
the
correct
observance
of
religious
festivals
with
the
rude
methods
at
their
command
they
are
not
always
able
to
hit
upon
the
exact
date
on
which
these
should
occur
these
festivals
are
often
of
a
highly
elaborate
nature
and
occupy
many
days
in
their
celebration
the
most
minute
attention
being
paid
to
the
proper
performance
of
the
various
rites
connected
with
them
they
consist
for
the
most
part
of
a
preliminary
fast
followed
by
symbolic
dances
or
magical
ceremonies
and
concluding
with
a
gluttonous
orgy
most
of
these
observances
possess
great
similarity
one
to
another
and
visible
differences
may
be
accounted
for
by
circumstances
of
environment
or
seasonal
variations
when
the
white
man
first
came
into
contact
with
the
algonquian
race
it
was
observed
that
they
held
regularly
recurring
festivals
to
celebrate
the
ripening
of
fruits
and
grain
and
more
irregular
feasts
to
mark
the
return
of
and
the
hunting
season
in
general
dances
were
engaged
in
and
heroic
songs
chanted
indeed
the
entire
observance
appears
to
have
been
identical
in
its
general
features
with
the
festival
of
one
of
the
most
remarkable
of
these
celebrations
is
that
of
the
creeks
called
the
a
contraction
for
its
native
name
pushkita
commencing
with
a
rigorous
fast
which
lasts
three
days
the
entire
tribe
assembles
on
the
fourth
day
to
watch
the
produce
a
new
fire
by
means
of
friction
from
this
flame
the
members
of
the
tribe
are
supplied
and
feasting
and
dancing
are
then
engaged
in
for
three
days
four
logs
are
arranged
in
the
form
of
a
cross
pointing
to
the
four
quarters
of
the
earth
and
burnt
as
an
offering
to
the
four
winds
the
buffalo
dance
the
mandans
a
dakota
tribe
each
year
celebrate
as
their
principal
festival
the
buffalo
dance
a
feast
which
marks
the
return
of
the
season
eight
men
wearing
on
their
backs
and
painted
black
red
or
white
imitate
the
actions
of
buffaloes
each
of
them
holds
a
rattle
in
his
right
hand
and
a
slender
rod
six
feet
long
in
his
left
and
carries
a
bunch
of
green
willow
boughs
on
his
back
the
ceremony
is
held
at
the
season
of
the
year
when
the
willow
is
in
full
leaf
the
dancers
take
up
their
positions
at
four
different
points
of
a
canoe
to
represent
the
four
cardinal
points
of
the
compass
two
men
dressed
as
grizzly
bears
stand
beside
the
canoe
growling
and
threatening
to
spring
upon
any
one
who
interferes
with
the
ceremony
the
bystanders
throw
them
pieces
of
food
which
are
at
once
pounced
upon
by
two
other
men
and
carried
off
by
them
to
the
prairie
during
the
ceremony
the
old
men
of
the
tribe
beat
upon
sacks
chanting
prayers
for
the
success
of
the
on
the
fourth
day
a
man
enters
the
camp
in
the
guise
of
an
evil
spirit
and
is
driven
from
the
vicinity
with
stones
and
curses
the
elucidation
of
this
ceremony
may
perhaps
be
as
follows
from
some
one
of
the
four
points
of
the
compass
the
buffalo
must
come
therefore
all
are
requested
to
send
goodly
supplies
the
men
dressed
as
bears
symbolize
the
wild
beasts
which
might
deflect
the
progress
of
the
herds
of
buffalo
toward
the
territory
of
the
tribe
and
therefore
must
be
placated
the
demon
who
visits
the
camp
after
the
ceremony
is
of
course
famine
of
the
hopi
the
most
highly
developed
north
american
festival
system
is
that
of
the
hopi
or
moqui
of
arizona
the
observances
of
which
are
almost
of
a
theatrical
nature
all
the
pueblo
indians
of
whom
the
hopi
are
a
division
possess
similar
festivals
which
recur
at
various
seasons
or
under
the
auspices
of
different
totem
clans
or
secret
societies
most
of
these
are
arranged
by
the
katcina
clan
and
take
place
in
known
as
these
ceremonies
have
their
origin
in
the
universal
reverence
shown
to
the
serpent
in
america
a
reverence
based
on
the
idea
that
the
symbol
of
the
serpent
tail
in
mouth
represented
the
round
full
sun
of
august
in
the
summer
feats
are
performed
but
in
the
katcina
ceremony
serpents
are
never
employed
are
by
no
means
uncommon
among
the
indians
the
purpose
of
these
is
to
drive
evil
spirits
from
the
vicinity
of
the
tribe
the
native
american
priesthood
whether
known
as
or
wizards
were
in
most
tribes
a
caste
apart
exercising
not
only
the
priestly
function
but
those
of
physician
and
prophet
as
well
the
name
therefore
is
scarcely
a
misnomer
they
were
skilled
in
the
handling
of
occult
forces
such
as
hypnotism
and
thus
exercised
unlimited
sway
over
the
rank
and
file
of
the
tribe
but
we
shall
first
consider
them
in
their
religious
aspect
in
many
of
the
indian
tribes
the
priesthood
was
a
hereditary
office
in
others
it
was
obtained
through
natural
fitness
or
revelation
in
dreams
with
the
cherokees
for
example
the
seventh
son
of
a
family
was
usually
marked
out
as
a
suitable
person
for
the
priesthood
as
a
rule
the
religious
body
did
not
share
in
the
general
life
of
the
tribe
from
which
to
a
great
degree
it
isolated
itself
for
example
bartram
in
his
in
the
describes
the
younger
priests
of
the
creeks
as
being
arrayed
in
white
robes
and
carrying
on
their
heads
or
arms
a
great
stuffed
very
ingeniously
as
an
insignia
of
wisdom
and
divination
these
bachelors
are
also
distinguishable
from
the
other
people
by
their
taciturnity
grave
and
solemn
countenance
dignified
step
and
singing
to
themselves
songs
or
hymns
in
a
low
sweet
voice
as
they
stroll
about
the
towns
to
add
to
the
feeling
of
awe
which
they
inspired
among
the
laymen
of
the
tribe
the
priests
conversed
with
one
another
in
a
secret
tongue
thus
the
magical
formulæ
of
some
of
the
algonquin
priests
were
not
in
the
ordinary
language
but
in
a
dialect
of
their
own
invention
the
choctaws
cherokees
and
zuñi
employed
similar
esoteric
dialects
all
of
which
are
now
known
to
be
merely
modifications
of
their
several
tribal
languages
fortified
with
obsolete
words
or
else
mere
borrowings
from
the
idioms
of
other
tribes
as
healers
it
was
however
as
healers
that
the
were
the
indian
assigns
all
illness
or
bodily
discomfort
to
supernatural
agency
he
can
not
comprehend
that
indisposition
may
arise
within
his
own
system
but
believes
that
it
must
necessarily
proceed
from
some
external
source
some
supernatural
being
whom
he
has
offended
the
soul
of
an
animal
which
he
has
slain
or
perhaps
a
malevolent
sorcerer
torments
him
if
the
bodies
of
mankind
were
not
afflicted
in
this
mysterious
manner
their
owners
would
endure
for
ever
when
the
indian
falls
sick
he
betakes
himself
to
a
to
whom
he
relates
his
symptoms
at
the
same
time
acquainting
him
with
any
circumstances
which
he
may
suspect
of
having
brought
about
his
condition
if
he
has
slain
a
deer
and
omitted
the
usual
formula
of
placation
afterward
he
suspects
that
the
spirit
of
the
beast
is
actively
harming
him
should
he
have
shot
a
bird
and
have
subsequently
observed
any
of
the
same
species
near
his
dwelling
he
will
almost
invariably
conclude
that
they
were
bent
on
a
mission
of
vengeance
and
have
by
some
means
injured
him
the
in
the
first
instance
may
give
his
patient
some
simple
native
remedy
if
this
treatment
does
not
avail
he
will
arrange
to
go
to
the
sufferer
lodge
for
the
purpose
of
making
a
more
thorough
examination
having
located
the
seat
of
the
pain
he
will
blow
upon
it
several
times
and
then
proceed
to
massage
it
vigorously
invoking
the
while
the
aid
of
the
natural
enemy
of
the
spirit
which
he
suspects
is
tormenting
the
sick
man
thus
if
a
deer
spirit
be
suspected
he
will
call
upon
the
mountain
lion
or
the
great
dog
to
drive
it
away
but
if
a
bird
of
any
of
the
smaller
varieties
he
will
invoke
the
great
eagle
who
dwells
in
the
zenith
to
slay
or
devour
it
upon
the
supposed
approach
of
these
potent
beings
he
will
become
more
excited
and
vigorously
slapping
the
patient
will
chant
incantations
in
a
loud
and
sonorous
voice
which
are
supposed
to
hasten
the
advent
of
the
friendly
beings
whom
he
has
summoned
at
last
producing
by
sleight
of
hand
an
image
of
the
disturbing
spirit
worked
in
bone
he
calls
for
a
vessel
of
boiling
water
into
which
he
promptly
plunges
the
supposed
cause
of
his
patient
illness
the
bone
figure
is
withdrawn
from
the
boiling
water
after
a
space
and
on
being
examined
may
be
found
to
have
one
or
more
scores
on
its
surface
each
of
these
shows
that
it
has
already
slain
its
man
and
the
patient
is
assured
that
had
the
native
æsculapius
not
adopted
severe
measures
the
malign
spirit
would
have
added
him
to
the
number
of
its
victims
should
these
methods
not
result
in
a
cure
others
are
resorted
to
the
patient
is
regaled
with
the
choicest
food
and
drink
while
incantations
are
chanted
and
music
performed
to
frighten
away
the
malign
influences
professional
etiquette
the
priestly
class
is
not
given
to
levying
exorbitant
fees
upon
its
patients
as
a
rule
the
indian
strongly
resents
any
allusion
to
a
fee
should
the
payment
be
of
a
perishable
nature
such
as
food
he
usually
shares
it
with
his
relatives
or
even
his
patients
but
should
it
consist
of
something
that
may
be
retained
such
as
cloth
teeth
necklaces
or
skins
he
will
carefully
hoard
it
to
afford
provision
for
his
old
age
the
indian
practitioner
is
strongly
of
opinion
that
white
doctors
are
of
little
service
in
the
cure
of
native
illnesses
white
medicine
he
says
is
good
only
for
white
men
and
indian
medicine
for
the
red
man
in
which
conclusion
he
is
probably
justified
journeys
in
in
many
indian
myths
we
read
how
the
singly
or
in
companies
seek
the
either
to
search
for
the
souls
of
those
who
are
ill
but
not
yet
dead
or
to
seek
advice
from
supernatural
beings
these
thaumaturgical
practices
were
usually
undertaken
by
three
acting
in
concert
falling
into
a
trance
in
which
their
souls
were
supposed
to
become
temporarily
disunited
from
their
bodies
they
would
follow
the
track
of
the
sick
man
spirit
into
the
the
order
in
which
they
travelled
was
determined
by
the
relative
strength
of
their
guardian
spirits
those
with
the
strongest
being
first
and
last
and
he
who
had
the
weakest
being
placed
in
the
middle
if
the
sick
man
track
turned
to
the
left
they
said
he
would
die
but
if
to
the
right
he
would
recover
from
the
trail
they
could
also
divine
whether
any
supernatural
danger
was
near
and
the
foremost
priest
would
utter
a
magic
chant
to
avert
such
evils
if
they
came
from
the
front
while
if
the
danger
came
from
the
rear
the
incantation
was
sung
by
the
priest
who
came
last
generally
their
sojourn
occupied
one
or
two
nights
and
having
rescued
the
soul
of
the
patient
they
returned
to
place
it
in
his
body
not
only
was
the
endowed
with
the
power
of
projecting
his
own
body
into
the
land
of
spirits
by
placing
charms
in
the
hands
of
persons
who
had
not
yet
received
a
guardian
spirit
he
could
impart
to
them
his
clairvoyant
gifts
enabling
them
to
visit
the
and
make
any
observations
required
by
him
the
souls
of
chiefs
instead
of
following
the
usual
route
went
directly
to
the
where
only
the
most
gifted
could
follow
their
trail
the
sea
was
regarded
as
the
highway
to
the
supernatural
regions
a
sick
man
was
in
the
greatest
peril
at
high
water
but
when
the
tide
was
low
the
danger
was
less
the
means
adopted
by
the
to
lure
ghosts
away
from
their
pursuit
of
a
soul
was
to
create
an
deer
the
ghosts
would
turn
from
hunting
the
man
soul
to
follow
that
of
the
beast
the
savage
and
religion
it
can
not
be
said
that
the
religious
sense
was
exceptionally
strong
in
the
mind
of
the
north
american
indian
but
this
was
due
principally
to
the
stage
of
culture
at
which
he
stood
and
in
some
cases
still
stands
in
man
in
his
savage
or
barbarian
condition
the
sense
of
reverence
as
we
conceive
it
is
small
and
its
place
is
largely
filled
by
fear
and
superstition
it
is
only
at
a
later
stage
when
civilizing
influences
have
to
some
extent
banished
the
grosser
terrors
of
animism
and
fetishism
that
the
gods
reveal
themselves
in
a
more
spiritual
aspect
chapter
iii
algonquian
myths
and
legends
glooskap
and
malsum
the
algonquin
indians
have
perhaps
a
more
extensive
mythology
than
the
majority
of
indian
peoples
and
as
they
have
been
known
to
civilization
for
several
centuries
their
myths
have
the
advantage
of
having
been
thoroughly
examined
one
of
the
most
interesting
figures
in
their
pantheon
is
glooskap
which
means
liar
but
so
far
from
an
affront
being
intended
to
the
deity
by
this
appellation
it
was
bestowed
as
a
compliment
to
his
craftiness
cunning
being
regarded
as
one
of
the
virtues
by
all
savage
peoples
glooskap
and
his
brother
malsum
the
wolf
were
twins
and
from
this
we
may
infer
that
they
were
the
opposites
of
a
dualistic
system
glooskap
standing
for
what
seems
to
the
savage
and
malsum
for
all
that
was
their
mother
died
at
their
birth
and
out
of
her
body
glooskap
formed
the
sun
and
moon
animals
fishes
and
the
human
race
while
the
malicious
malsum
made
mountains
valleys
serpents
and
every
manner
of
thing
which
he
considered
would
inconvenience
the
race
of
men
this
and
however
is
purely
relative
and
of
modern
origin
such
deities
as
already
explained
being
figures
in
a
myth
each
of
the
brothers
possessed
a
secret
as
to
what
would
kill
him
as
do
many
other
beings
in
myth
and
fairy
story
notably
liew
llaw
gyffes
in
welsh
romance
malsum
asked
glooskap
in
what
manner
he
could
be
killed
and
the
elder
brother
to
try
his
sincerity
replied
that
the
only
way
in
which
his
life
could
be
taken
was
by
the
touch
of
an
owl
feather
or
as
some
variants
of
the
myth
say
by
that
of
a
flowering
rush
malsum
in
his
turn
confided
to
glooskap
that
he
could
only
perish
by
a
blow
from
a
the
malicious
wolf
taking
his
bow
brought
down
an
owl
and
while
glooskap
slept
struck
him
with
a
feather
plucked
from
its
wing
glooskap
immediately
expired
but
to
malsum
chagrin
came
to
life
again
this
tale
is
surprisingly
reminiscent
of
the
scandinavian
myth
of
balder
who
would
only
die
if
struck
by
a
sprig
of
mistletoe
by
his
brother
hodur
like
balder
glooskap
is
a
as
is
well
proved
by
the
circumstance
that
when
he
dies
he
does
not
fail
to
revive
but
malsum
resolved
to
learn
his
brother
secret
and
to
destroy
him
at
the
first
opportunity
glooskap
had
told
him
subsequently
to
his
first
attempt
that
only
a
could
kill
him
and
with
this
malsum
struck
him
while
he
slept
as
before
but
glooskap
rising
up
and
laughing
drove
malsum
into
the
forest
and
seated
himself
by
a
stream
where
he
murmured
as
if
musing
to
himself
only
a
flowering
rush
can
kill
me
now
he
said
this
because
he
knew
that
the
great
beaver
was
hidden
among
the
rushes
on
the
bank
of
the
stream
and
would
hear
every
word
he
uttered
the
beaver
went
at
once
to
malsum
and
told
him
what
he
regarded
as
his
brother
vital
secret
the
wicked
malsum
was
so
glad
that
he
promised
to
give
the
beaver
whatever
he
might
ask
for
but
when
the
beast
asked
for
wings
like
a
pigeon
malsum
burst
into
mocking
laughter
and
cried
ho
you
with
the
tail
like
a
file
what
need
have
you
of
wings
at
this
the
beaver
was
wroth
and
going
to
glooskap
made
a
clean
breast
of
what
he
had
done
glooskap
now
thoroughly
infuriated
dug
up
a
and
rushing
into
the
recesses
of
the
forest
sought
out
his
treacherous
brother
and
with
a
blow
of
the
fatal
plant
struck
him
dead
scandinavian
analogies
but
although
malsum
was
slain
he
subsequently
appears
in
algonquian
myth
as
lox
or
loki
the
chief
of
the
wolves
a
mischievous
and
restless
spirit
in
his
account
of
the
algonquian
mythology
charles
godfrey
leland
appears
to
think
that
the
entire
system
has
been
sophisticated
by
norse
mythology
filtering
through
the
eskimo
although
the
probabilities
are
against
such
a
theory
there
are
many
points
in
common
between
the
two
systems
as
we
shall
see
later
and
among
them
few
are
more
striking
than
the
fact
that
the
scandinavian
and
algonquian
evil
influences
possess
one
and
the
same
name
when
glooskap
had
completed
the
world
he
made
man
and
the
smaller
supernatural
beings
such
as
fairies
and
dwarfs
he
formed
man
from
the
trunk
of
an
and
the
elves
from
its
bark
like
odin
he
trained
two
birds
to
bring
him
the
news
of
the
world
but
their
absences
were
so
prolonged
that
he
selected
a
black
and
a
white
wolf
as
his
attendants
he
waged
a
strenuous
and
exterminating
warfare
on
the
evil
monsters
which
then
infested
the
world
and
on
the
sorcerers
and
witches
who
were
harmful
to
man
he
levelled
the
hills
and
restrained
the
forces
of
nature
in
his
mighty
struggles
in
which
he
towered
to
giant
stature
his
head
and
shoulders
rising
high
above
the
clouds
yet
in
his
dealings
with
men
he
was
gentle
and
quietly
humorous
not
to
say
ingenuous
on
one
occasion
he
sought
out
a
giant
sorcerer
named
one
of
the
most
powerful
of
the
evil
influences
then
dwelling
upon
the
earth
shot
upward
till
his
head
was
above
the
tallest
pine
of
the
forest
but
glooskap
with
a
laugh
grew
till
his
head
reached
the
stars
and
tapped
the
wizard
gently
with
the
butt
of
his
bow
so
that
he
fell
dead
at
his
feet
but
although
he
exterminated
many
monsters
and
placed
a
check
upon
the
advance
of
the
forces
of
evil
glooskap
did
not
find
that
the
race
of
men
grew
any
better
or
wiser
in
fact
the
more
he
accomplished
on
their
behalf
the
worse
they
became
until
at
last
they
reached
such
a
pitch
of
evil
conduct
that
the
god
resolved
to
quit
the
world
altogether
but
with
a
feeling
of
consideration
still
for
the
beings
he
had
created
he
announced
that
within
the
next
seven
years
he
would
grant
to
all
and
sundry
any
request
they
might
make
a
great
many
people
were
desirous
of
profiting
by
this
offer
but
it
was
with
the
utmost
difficulty
that
they
could
discover
where
glooskap
was
those
who
did
find
him
and
who
chose
injudiciously
were
severely
punished
while
those
whose
desires
were
reasonable
were
substantially
rewarded
glooskap
gifts
four
indians
who
won
to
glooskap
abode
found
it
a
place
of
magical
delights
a
land
fairer
than
the
mind
could
conceive
asked
by
the
god
what
had
brought
them
thither
one
replied
that
his
heart
was
evil
and
that
anger
had
made
him
its
slave
but
that
he
wished
to
be
meek
and
pious
the
second
a
poor
man
desired
to
be
rich
and
the
third
who
was
of
low
estate
and
despised
by
the
folk
of
his
tribe
wished
to
be
universally
honoured
and
respected
the
fourth
was
a
vain
man
conscious
of
his
good
looks
whose
appearance
was
eloquent
of
conceit
although
he
was
tall
he
had
stuffed
fur
into
his
moccasins
to
make
him
appear
still
taller
and
his
wish
was
that
he
might
become
bigger
than
any
man
of
his
tribe
and
that
he
might
live
for
ages
glooskap
drew
four
small
boxes
from
his
and
gave
one
to
each
desiring
that
they
should
not
open
them
until
they
reached
home
when
the
first
three
arrived
at
their
respective
lodges
each
opened
his
box
and
found
therein
an
unguent
of
great
fragrance
and
richness
with
which
he
rubbed
himself
the
wicked
man
became
meek
and
patient
the
poor
man
speedily
grew
wealthy
and
the
despised
man
became
stately
and
respected
but
the
conceited
man
had
stopped
on
his
way
home
in
a
clearing
in
the
woods
and
taking
out
his
box
had
anointed
himself
with
the
ointment
it
contained
his
wish
also
was
granted
but
not
exactly
in
the
manner
he
expected
for
he
was
changed
into
a
the
first
of
the
species
and
the
tallest
tree
of
the
forest
at
that
glooskap
and
the
baby
glooskap
having
conquered
the
kewawkqu
a
race
of
giants
and
magicians
and
the
medecolin
who
were
cunning
sorcerers
and
pamola
a
wicked
spirit
of
the
night
besides
hosts
of
fiends
goblins
cannibals
and
witches
felt
himself
great
indeed
and
boasted
to
a
certain
woman
that
there
was
nothing
left
for
him
to
subdue
but
the
woman
laughed
and
said
are
you
quite
sure
master
there
is
still
one
who
remains
unconquered
and
nothing
can
overcome
him
in
some
surprise
glooskap
inquired
the
name
of
this
mighty
individual
he
is
called
wasis
replied
the
woman
but
i
strongly
advise
you
to
have
no
dealings
with
him
wasis
was
only
the
baby
who
sat
on
the
floor
sucking
a
piece
of
and
crooning
a
little
song
to
himself
now
glooskap
had
never
married
and
was
quite
ignorant
of
how
children
are
managed
but
with
perfect
confidence
he
smiled
to
the
baby
and
asked
it
to
come
to
him
the
baby
smiled
back
to
him
but
never
moved
whereupon
glooskap
imitated
the
beautiful
song
of
a
certain
bird
wasis
however
paid
no
heed
to
him
but
went
on
sucking
his
glooskap
unaccustomed
to
such
treatment
lashed
himself
into
a
furious
rage
and
in
terrible
and
threatening
accents
ordered
wasis
to
come
crawling
to
him
at
once
but
wasis
burst
into
direful
howling
which
quite
drowned
the
god
thunderous
accents
and
for
all
the
threatenings
of
the
deity
he
would
not
budge
glooskap
now
thoroughly
aroused
brought
all
his
magical
resources
to
his
aid
he
recited
the
most
terrible
spells
the
most
dreadful
incantations
he
sang
the
songs
which
raise
the
dead
and
which
sent
the
devil
scurrying
to
the
nethermost
depths
of
the
pit
but
wasis
evidently
seemed
to
think
this
was
all
some
sort
of
a
game
for
he
merely
smiled
wearily
and
looked
a
trifle
bored
at
last
glooskap
in
despair
rushed
from
the
hut
while
wasis
sitting
on
the
floor
cried
goo
goo
and
crowed
triumphantly
and
to
this
day
the
indians
say
that
when
a
baby
cries
goo
he
remembers
the
time
when
he
conquered
the
mighty
glooskap
illustration
glooskap
brought
all
his
magical
resources
to
his
aid
glooskap
farewell
at
length
the
day
on
which
glooskap
was
to
leave
the
earth
arrived
and
to
celebrate
the
event
he
caused
a
great
feast
to
be
made
on
the
shores
of
lake
minas
it
was
attended
by
all
the
animals
and
when
it
drew
to
a
close
glooskap
entered
his
great
canoe
and
slowly
drifted
out
of
sight
when
they
could
see
him
no
longer
they
still
heard
his
beautiful
singing
growing
fainter
and
fainter
in
the
distance
until
at
last
it
died
away
altogether
then
a
strange
thing
happened
the
beasts
who
up
to
this
time
had
spoken
but
one
language
could
no
longer
understand
each
other
and
in
confusion
fled
away
never
again
to
meet
in
friendly
converse
until
glooskap
shall
return
and
revive
the
halcyon
days
of
the
golden
age
this
tradition
of
glooskap
strikingly
recalls
that
of
the
mexican
god
quetzalcoatl
who
drifted
from
the
shores
of
mexico
eastward
toward
the
fabled
land
of
tlapallan
whence
he
had
originally
come
glooskap
like
the
mexican
deity
alluded
to
is
as
has
already
been
indicated
a
or
more
properly
speaking
a
son
of
the
sun
who
has
come
to
earth
on
a
mission
of
enlightenment
and
civilization
to
render
the
world
habitable
for
mankind
and
to
sow
the
seeds
of
the
arts
domestic
and
agricultural
quetzalcoatl
disappeared
toward
the
east
because
it
was
the
original
home
of
his
father
the
sun
and
not
toward
the
west
which
is
merely
the
sun
for
the
night
but
glooskap
drifted
westward
as
most
do
how
glooskap
caught
the
summer
a
very
beautiful
myth
tells
how
glooskap
captured
the
summer
the
form
in
which
it
is
preserved
is
a
kind
of
poetry
possessing
something
in
the
nature
of
metre
which
until
a
few
generations
ago
was
recited
by
many
algonquian
firesides
a
long
time
ago
glooskap
wandered
very
far
north
to
the
and
feeling
tired
and
cold
sought
shelter
at
a
wigwam
where
dwelt
a
great
giant
the
giant
winter
winter
received
the
god
hospitably
filled
a
pipe
of
tobacco
for
him
and
entertained
him
with
charming
stories
of
the
old
time
as
he
smoked
all
the
time
winter
was
casting
his
spell
over
glooskap
for
as
he
talked
drowsily
and
monotonously
he
gave
forth
a
freezing
atmosphere
so
that
glooskap
first
dozed
and
then
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
the
heavy
slumber
of
the
winter
season
for
six
whole
months
he
slept
then
the
spell
of
the
frost
arose
from
his
brain
and
he
awoke
he
took
his
way
homeward
and
southward
and
the
farther
south
he
fared
the
warmer
it
felt
and
the
flowers
began
to
spring
up
around
his
steps
at
length
he
came
to
a
vast
trackless
forest
where
under
primeval
trees
many
little
people
were
dancing
the
queen
of
these
folk
was
summer
a
most
exquisitely
beautiful
if
very
tiny
creature
glooskap
caught
the
queen
up
in
his
great
hand
and
cutting
a
long
lasso
from
the
hide
of
a
moose
secured
it
round
her
tiny
frame
then
he
ran
away
letting
the
cord
trail
loosely
behind
him
the
elves
of
light
the
tiny
people
who
were
the
elves
of
light
came
clamouring
shrilly
after
him
pulling
frantically
at
the
lasso
but
as
glooskap
ran
the
cord
ran
out
and
pull
as
they
might
they
were
left
far
behind
northward
he
journeyed
once
more
and
came
to
the
wigwam
of
winter
the
giant
again
received
him
hospitably
and
began
to
tell
the
old
stories
whose
vague
charm
had
exercised
such
a
fascination
upon
the
god
but
glooskap
in
his
turn
began
to
speak
summer
was
lying
in
his
bosom
and
her
strength
and
heat
sent
forth
such
powerful
magic
that
at
length
winter
began
to
show
signs
of
distress
the
sweat
poured
profusely
down
his
face
and
gradually
he
commenced
to
melt
as
did
his
dwelling
then
slowly
nature
awoke
the
song
of
birds
was
heard
first
faintly
then
more
clearly
and
joyously
the
thin
green
shoots
of
the
young
grass
appeared
and
the
dead
leaves
of
last
autumn
were
carried
down
to
the
river
by
the
melting
snow
lastly
the
fairies
came
out
and
glooskap
leaving
summer
with
them
once
more
bent
his
steps
southward
this
is
obviously
a
conceived
by
a
people
dwelling
in
a
climate
where
the
rigours
of
winter
gave
way
for
a
more
or
less
brief
space
only
to
the
blandishments
of
summer
to
them
winter
was
a
giant
and
summer
an
elf
of
pigmy
proportions
the
stories
told
during
the
winter
season
are
eloquent
of
the
life
led
by
people
dwelling
in
a
climate
where
the
traditional
tale
the
father
of
epic
poetry
whiles
away
the
long
dark
hours
while
the
winter
tempest
roars
furiously
without
and
the
snow
renders
the
daily
occupation
of
the
hunter
impossible
glooskap
wigwam
the
indians
say
that
glooskap
lives
far
away
no
one
knows
where
in
a
very
great
wigwam
his
chief
occupation
is
making
arrows
and
it
would
appear
that
each
of
these
stands
for
a
day
one
side
of
his
wigwam
is
covered
with
arrows
and
when
his
lodge
shall
be
filled
with
them
the
last
great
day
will
arrive
then
he
will
call
upon
his
army
of
good
spirits
and
go
forth
to
attack
malsum
in
a
wonderful
canoe
which
by
magical
means
can
be
made
to
expand
so
as
to
hold
an
army
or
contract
so
that
it
may
be
carried
in
the
palm
of
the
hand
the
war
with
his
evil
brother
will
be
one
of
extermination
and
not
one
single
individual
on
either
side
will
be
left
but
the
good
will
go
to
glooskap
beautiful
abode
and
all
will
be
well
at
last
the
chill
breezes
had
long
forewarned
the
geese
of
the
coming
cold
season
and
the
constant
cry
from
above
of
honk
honk
told
the
indians
that
the
birds
migration
was
in
progress
the
of
the
blackfeet
an
algonquian
tribe
were
abroad
with
the
object
of
procuring
the
thick
robes
and
the
rich
meat
which
would
keep
them
warm
and
provide
good
fare
through
the
desolate
winter
moons
sacred
otter
had
been
lucky
many
buffaloes
had
fallen
to
him
and
he
was
busily
occupied
in
skinning
them
but
while
the
braves
plied
the
knife
quickly
and
deftly
they
heeded
not
the
dun
lowering
clouds
heavy
with
tempest
hanging
like
a
black
curtain
over
the
northern
horizon
suddenly
the
clouds
swooped
down
from
their
place
in
the
heavens
like
a
flight
of
black
eagles
and
with
a
roar
the
blizzard
was
upon
them
illustration
he
descried
a
great
sacred
otter
and
his
son
crouched
beneath
the
carcass
of
a
dead
buffalo
for
shelter
but
the
air
was
frore
as
water
in
which
the
ice
is
floating
and
he
knew
that
they
would
quickly
perish
unless
they
could
find
some
better
protection
from
the
bitter
wind
so
he
made
a
small
or
tent
out
of
the
buffalo
hide
and
both
crawled
inside
against
this
crazy
shelter
the
snow
quickly
gathered
and
drifted
so
that
soon
the
inmates
of
the
tiny
lodge
sank
into
a
comfortable
drowse
induced
by
the
gentle
warmth
as
sacred
otter
slept
he
dreamed
away
in
the
distance
he
descried
a
great
crowned
with
a
colour
like
the
gold
of
sunlight
and
painted
with
a
cluster
of
stars
symbolic
of
the
north
the
ruddy
disc
of
the
sun
was
pictured
at
the
back
and
to
this
was
affixed
the
tail
of
the
sacred
buffalo
the
skirts
of
the
were
painted
to
represent
ice
and
on
its
side
had
been
drawn
four
yellow
legs
with
green
claws
typical
of
the
a
buffalo
in
glaring
red
frowned
above
the
door
and
bunches
of
with
small
bells
attached
swung
and
tinkled
in
the
breeze
sacred
otter
surprised
at
the
unusual
nature
of
the
paintings
stood
before
the
lost
in
admiration
of
its
decorations
when
he
was
startled
to
hear
a
voice
say
who
walks
round
my
come
in
come
in
the
lord
of
cold
weather
sacred
otter
entered
and
beheld
a
tall
man
clothed
all
in
white
sitting
at
the
back
of
the
lodge
of
which
he
was
the
sole
occupant
sacred
otter
took
a
seat
but
the
owner
of
the
never
looked
his
way
smoking
on
in
stolid
silence
before
him
was
an
earthen
altar
on
which
was
laid
juniper
as
in
the
sun
ceremonial
his
face
was
painted
yellow
with
a
red
line
in
the
region
of
the
mouth
and
another
across
the
eyes
to
the
ears
across
his
breast
he
wore
a
and
round
his
waist
small
strips
of
to
all
of
which
bells
were
attached
for
a
long
time
he
kept
silence
but
at
length
he
laid
down
his
black
stone
pipe
and
addressed
sacred
otter
as
follows
i
am
the
lord
of
cold
weather
and
this
my
dwelling
is
the
or
yellow
paint
lodge
i
control
and
send
the
driving
snow
and
biting
winds
from
the
northland
you
are
here
because
i
have
taken
pity
upon
you
and
on
your
son
who
was
caught
in
the
blizzard
with
you
take
this
with
its
symbols
and
medicines
take
also
this
this
black
stone
pipe
and
my
supernatural
power
you
must
make
a
similar
to
this
on
your
return
to
camp
the
lord
of
cold
weather
then
minutely
explained
to
sacred
otter
the
symbols
of
which
he
must
make
use
in
painting
the
lodge
and
gave
him
the
songs
and
ceremonial
connected
with
it
at
this
juncture
sacred
otter
awoke
he
observed
that
the
storm
had
abated
somewhat
and
as
soon
as
it
grew
fair
enough
he
and
his
son
crawled
from
their
shelter
and
tramped
home
through
the
soft
snow
sacred
otter
spent
the
long
cold
nights
in
making
a
model
of
the
and
painting
it
as
he
had
been
directed
in
his
dream
he
also
collected
the
necessary
for
the
ceremonial
and
in
the
spring
when
new
lodges
were
made
he
built
and
painted
the
the
power
of
sacred
otter
waxed
great
because
of
his
possession
of
the
which
the
lord
of
cold
had
vouchsafed
to
him
in
dream
soon
was
it
proved
once
more
while
hunting
buffalo
he
and
several
companions
were
caught
in
a
blizzard
when
many
a
weary
mile
from
camp
they
appealed
to
sacred
otter
to
utilize
the
of
the
lord
of
cold
directing
that
several
women
and
children
who
were
with
the
party
should
be
placed
on
sledges
and
that
the
men
should
go
in
advance
and
break
a
passage
through
the
snow
for
the
horses
he
took
the
mink
and
the
black
stone
pipe
he
had
received
from
the
and
commenced
to
smoke
he
blew
the
smoke
in
the
direction
whence
the
storm
came
and
prayed
to
the
lord
of
cold
to
have
pity
on
the
people
gradually
the
broke
and
cleared
and
on
every
side
the
blue
sky
was
seen
the
people
hastened
on
as
they
knew
the
blizzard
was
only
being
held
back
for
a
space
but
their
camp
was
at
hand
and
they
soon
reached
it
in
safety
never
again
however
would
sacred
otter
use
his
mystic
power
for
he
dreaded
that
he
might
offend
the
lord
of
cold
and
who
could
afford
to
do
that
the
a
pretty
legend
of
the
chippeways
an
algonquian
tribe
tells
how
algon
a
hunter
won
for
his
bride
the
daughter
of
a
star
while
walking
over
the
prairies
he
discovered
a
circular
pathway
worn
as
if
by
the
tread
of
many
feet
though
there
were
no
visible
outside
its
bounds
the
young
hunter
who
had
never
before
encountered
one
or
these
rings
was
filled
with
surprise
at
the
discovery
and
hid
himself
in
the
long
grass
to
see
whether
an
explanation
might
not
be
forthcoming
he
had
not
long
to
wait
in
a
little
while
he
heard
the
sound
of
music
so
faint
and
sweet
that
it
surpassed
anything
he
had
ever
dreamed
of
the
strains
grew
fuller
and
richer
and
as
they
seemed
to
come
from
above
he
turned
his
eyes
toward
the
sky
far
in
the
blue
he
could
see
a
tiny
white
speck
like
a
floating
cloud
nearer
and
nearer
it
came
and
the
astonished
hunter
saw
that
it
was
no
cloud
but
a
dainty
osier
car
in
which
were
seated
twelve
beautiful
maidens
the
music
he
had
heard
was
the
sound
of
their
voices
as
they
sang
strange
and
magical
songs
descending
into
the
charmed
ring
they
danced
round
and
round
with
such
exquisite
grace
and
abandon
that
it
was
a
sheer
delight
to
watch
them
but
after
the
first
moments
of
dazzled
surprise
algon
had
eyes
only
for
the
youngest
of
the
group
a
slight
vivacious
creature
so
fragile
and
delicate
that
it
seemed
to
the
stalwart
hunter
that
a
breath
would
blow
her
away
he
was
indeed
seized
with
a
fierce
passion
for
the
dainty
sprite
and
he
speedily
decided
to
spring
from
the
grass
and
carry
her
off
but
the
pretty
creatures
were
too
quick
for
him
the
fairy
of
his
choice
skilfully
eluded
his
grasp
and
rushed
to
the
car
the
others
followed
and
in
a
moment
they
were
soaring
up
in
the
air
singing
a
sweet
unearthly
song
the
disconsolate
hunter
returned
to
his
lodge
but
try
as
he
might
he
could
not
get
the
thought
of
the
out
of
his
head
and
next
day
long
before
the
hour
of
the
fairies
arrival
he
lay
in
the
grass
awaiting
the
sweet
sounds
that
would
herald
their
approach
at
length
the
car
appeared
the
twelve
ethereal
beings
danced
as
before
again
algon
made
a
desperate
attempt
to
seize
the
youngest
and
again
he
was
unsuccessful
let
us
stay
said
one
of
the
perhaps
the
mortal
wishes
to
teach
us
his
earthly
dances
but
the
youngest
sister
would
not
hear
of
it
and
they
all
rose
out
of
sight
in
their
osier
basket
algon
strategy
poor
algon
returned
home
more
unhappy
than
ever
all
night
he
lay
awake
dreaming
of
the
pretty
elusive
creature
who
had
wound
a
chain
of
gossamer
round
his
heart
and
brain
and
early
in
the
morning
he
repaired
to
the
enchanted
spot
casting
about
for
some
means
of
gaining
his
end
he
came
upon
the
hollow
trunk
of
a
tree
in
which
a
number
of
mice
gambolled
with
the
aid
of
the
charms
in
his
he
turned
himself
into
one
of
these
little
animals
thinking
the
fair
sisters
would
never
pierce
his
disguise
illustration
algon
carries
the
captured
maiden
home
to
his
lodge
that
day
when
the
osier
car
descended
its
occupants
alighted
and
danced
merrily
as
they
were
wont
in
the
magic
circle
till
the
youngest
saw
the
hollow
which
had
not
been
there
on
the
previous
day
and
turned
to
fly
her
sisters
laughed
at
her
fears
and
tried
to
reassure
her
by
overturning
the
the
mice
scampered
in
all
directions
and
were
quickly
pursued
by
the
who
killed
them
all
except
algon
the
latter
regained
his
own
shape
just
as
the
youngest
fairy
raised
her
hand
to
strike
him
clasping
her
in
his
arms
he
bore

to
his
village

frightened

ascended

at
his
home
algon
married
the
maiden
and
by
his
kindness
and
gentleness
soon
won
her
affection
however
her
thoughts
still
dwelt
on
her
own
people
and
though
she
indulged
her
sorrow
only
in
secret
lest
it
should
trouble
her
husband
she
never
ceased
to
lament
her
lost
home
the
escape
one
day
while
she
was
out
with
her
little
son
she
made
a
basket
of
osiers
like
the
one
in
which
she
had
first
come
to
earth
gathering
together
some
flowers
and
gifts
for
the
she
took
the
child
with
her
into
the
basket
sang
the
magical
songs
she
still
remembered
and
soon
floated
up
to
her
own
country
where
she
was
welcomed
by
the
king
her
father
algon
grief
was
bitter
indeed
when
he
found
that
his
wife
and
child
had
left
him
but
he
had
no
means
of
following
them
every
day
he
would
go
to
the
magic
circle
on
the
prairie
and
give
vent
to
his
sorrow
but
the
years
went
past
and
there
was
no
sign
of
his
dear
ones
returning
meanwhile
the
woman
and
her
son
had
almost
forgotten
algon
and
the
however
when
the
boy
grew
old
enough
to
hear
the
story
he
wished
to
go
and
see
his
father
his
mother
consented
and
arranged
to
go
with
him
while
they
were
preparing
to
descend

said

algon
with
you
when
you
return
and
ask
him
to
bring
some
feature
from
every
beast
and
bird

has
killed
in
the
chase
algon
who
had
latterly
spent
almost
all
his
time
at
the
charmed
circle
was
overjoyed
to
see
his
wife
and
son
come
back
to
him
and
willingly
agreed
to
go
with
them
to
the
he
worked
very
hard
to
obtain
a
specimen
of
all
the
rare
and
curious
birds
and
beasts
in
his
land
and
when
at
last
he
had
gathered
the
relics
a
claw
of
one
a
feather
of
another
and
so
on
he
piled
them
in
the
osier
car
climbed
in
himself
with
his
wife
and
boy
and
set
off
to
the
the
people
there
were
delighted
with
the
curious
gifts
algon
had
brought
them
and
being
permitted
by
their
king
to
take
one
apiece
they
did
so
those
who
took
a
tail
or
a
claw
of
any
beast
at
once
became
the
quadruped
represented
by
the
fragment
and
those
who
took
the
wings
of
birds
became
birds
themselves
algon
and
his
wife
and
son
took
the
feathers
of
a
white
falcon
and
flew
down
to
the
prairies
where
their
descendants
may
still
be
seen
and
the
a
handsome
youth
once
dwelt
with
his
parents
on
the
banks
of
lake
huron
the
old
people
were
very
proud
of
their
boy
and
intended
that
he
should
become
a
great
warrior
when
he
grew
old
enough
to
prepare
his
he
set
off
into
the
forest
for
that
purpose
as
he
journeyed
he
grew
weary
and
lay
down
to
sleep
and
while
he
slept
he
heard
a
gentle
voice
whisper
i
have
come
to
fetch
you
follow
me
the
young
man
started
to
his
feet
i
am
dreaming
it
is
but
an
illusion
he
muttered
to
himself
as
he
gazed
at
the
owner
of
the
soft
voice
who
was
a
damsel
of
such
marvellous
beauty
that
the
sleepy
eyes
of
were
quite
dazzled
follow
me
she
said
again
and
rose
softly
from
the
ground
like
thistledown
to
his
surprise
the
youth
rose
along
with
her
as
lightly
and
as
easily
higher
they
went
and
still
higher
far
above
the
and
into
the
sky
till
they
passed
at
length
through
an
opening
in
the
spreading
vault
and
saw
that
he
was
in
the
country
of
the
and
that
his
beautiful
guide
was
no
mortal
maiden
but
a
supernatural
being
so
fascinated
was
he
by
her
sweetness
and
gentleness
that
he
followed
her
without
question
till
they
came
to
a
large
lodge
entering
it
at
the
invitation
of
the
found
it
filled
with
weapons
and
ornaments
of
silver
worked
in
strange
and
grotesque
designs
for
a
time
he
wandered
through
the
lodge
admiring
and
praising
all
he
saw
his
stirring
at
the
sight
of
the
rare
weapons
suddenly
the
lady
cried
hush
my
brother
approaches
let
me
hide
you
quick
the
young
man
crouched
in
a
corner
and
the
damsel
threw
a
richly
coloured
scarf
over
him
scarcely
had
she
done
so
when
a
grave
and
dignified
warrior
stalked
into
the
lodge
nemissa
my
dear
sister
he
said
after
a
moment
pause
have
you
not
been
forbidden
to
speak
to
the
perhaps
you
imagine
you
have
hidden
the
young
man
but
you
have
not
then
turning
from
the
blushing
nemissa
to
he
added
if
you
stay
long
there
you
will
be
very
hungry
come
out
and
let
us
have
a
talk
the
youth
did
as
he
was
bid
and
the
brother
of
nemissa
gave
him
a
pipe
and
a
bow
and
arrows
he
gave
him
also
nemissa
for
his
wife
and
for
a
long
time
they
lived
together
very
happily
the
now
the
young
man
observed
that
his
was
in
the
habit
of
going
away
every
day
by
himself
and
feeling
curious
to
know
what
his
business
might
be
he
asked
one
morning
whether
he
might
accompany
him
the
consented
readily
and
the
two
set
off
travelling
in
the
was
very
pleasant
the
foliage
was
richer
than
that
of
the
earth
the
flowers
more
delicately
coloured
the
air
softer
and
more
fragrant
and
the
birds
and
beasts
more
graceful
and
harmless
as
the
day
wore
on
to
noon
became
very
hungry
when
can
we
get
something
to
eat
he
asked
his
very
soon
was
the
reassuring
reply
we
are
just
going
to
make
a
repast
as
he
spoke
they
came
to
a
large
opening
through
which
they
could
see
the
lodges
and
lakes
and
forests
of
the
earth
at
one
place
some
hunters
were
preparing
for
the
chase
by
the
banks
of
a
river
some
women
were
gathering
reeds
and
down
in
a
village
a
number
of
children
were
playing
happily
do
you
see
that
boy
down
there
in
the
centre
of
the
group
said
the
brother
of
nemissa
and
as
he
spoke
he
threw
something
at
the
child
the
poor
boy
fell
down
instantly
and
was
carried
more
dead
than
alive
to
the
nearest
hut
the
sacrifice
was
much
perplexed
at
the
act
of
his
supernatural
relative
he
saw
the
gather
round
the
child
and
chant
prayers
for
his
recovery
it
is
the
will
of
manitou
said
one
priest
that
we
offer
a
white
dog
as
a
sacrifice
so
they
procured
a
white
dog
skinned
and
roasted
it
and
put
it
on
a
plate
it
flew
up
in
the
air
and
provided
a
meal
for
the
hungry
and
his
companion
the
child
recovered
and
returned
to
his
play
your
said
nemissa
brother
get
a
great
reputation
for
wisdom
simply
because
they
direct
the
people
to
me
you
think
they
are
very
clever
but
all
they
do
is
to
advise
you
to
sacrifice
to
me
it
is
i
who
recover
the
sick
found
in
this
spot
a
new
source
of
interest
but
at
length
the
delights
of
the
celestial
regions
began
to
pall
he
longed
for
the
companionship
of
his
own
kin
for
the
old
commonplace
pastimes
of
the
he
became
in
short
very
homesick
and
begged
his
wife
permission
to
return
to
earth
very
reluctantly
she
consented
remember
she
said
that
i
shall
have
the
power
to
recall
you
when
i
please
for
you
will
still
be
my
husband
and
above
all
do
not
marry
an
or
you
will
taste
of
my
vengeance
the
young
man
readily
promised
to
respect
her
injunctions
so
he
went
to
sleep
and
awoke
a
little
later
to
find
himself
lying
on
the
grass
close
by
his
father
lodge
his
parents
greeted
him
joyfully
he
had
been
absent
they
told
him
for
more
than
a
year
and
they
had
not
hoped
to
see
him
again
the
remembrance
of
his
sojourn
among
the
faded
gradually
to
a
dim
recollection
by
and
by
forgetting
the
wife
he
had
left
there
he
married
a
young
and
handsome
woman
belonging
to
his
own
village
four
days
after
the
wedding
she
died
but
failed
to
draw
a
lesson
from
this
unfortunate
occurrence
he
married
a
third
wife
but
one
day
he
was
missing
and
was
never
again
heard
of
his
had
recalled
him
to
the
sky
the
husband
in
a
northern
village
of
the
algonquins
dwelt
a
young
girl
so
exquisitely
beautiful
that
she
attracted
hosts
of
admirers
the
fame
of
her
beauty
spread
far
and
wide
and
warriors
and
hunters
thronged
to
her
father
lodge
in
order
to
behold
her
by
universal
consent
she
received
the
name
of
one
of
the
braves
who
was
most
assiduous
in
paying
her
his
addresses
was
surnamed
because
of
the
richness
of
his
costume
and
the
nobility
of
his
features
desiring
to
know
his
fate
the
young
man
confided
the
secret
of
his
love
for
handsome
to
another
of
his
suitors
and
proposed
that
they
two
should
that
day
approach
her
and
ask
her
hand
in
marriage
but
the
coquettish
maiden
dismissed
the
young
braves
disdainfully
and
to
add
to
the
indignity
of
her
refusal
repeated
it
in
public
outside
her
father
lodge
elegant
who
was
extremely
sensitive
was
so
humiliated
and
mortified
that
he
fell
into
a
deep
melancholy
settled
on
his
mind
he
refused
all
nourishment
and
for
hours
he
would
sit
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
in
moody
contemplation
a
profound
sense
of
disgrace
seized
upon
him
and
notwithstanding
the
arguments
of
his
relations
and
comrades
he
sank
deeper
into
lethargy
finally
he
took
to
his
bed
and
even
when
his
family
were
preparing
for
the
annual
migration
customary
with
the
tribe
he
refused
to
rise
from
it
although
they
removed
the
tent
from
above
his
head
and
packed
it
up
for
transport
the
lover
revenge
after
his
family
had
gone
elegant
appealed
to
his
guardian
spirit
or
totem
to
revenge
him
on
the
maiden
who
had
thus
cast
him
into
despondency
going
from
lodge
to
lodge
he
collected
all
the
rags
that
he
could
find
and
kneading
snow
over
a
framework
of
animals
bones
he
moulded
it
into
the
shape
of
a
man
which
he
attired
in
the
tatters
he
had
gathered
finally
covering
the
whole
with
brilliant
beads
and
gaudy
feathers
so
that
it
presented
a
very
imposing
appearance
by
magic
art
he
animated
this
singular
figure
placed
a
bow
and
arrows
into
its
hands
and
bestowed
on
it
the
name
of
moowis
together
the
pair
set
out
for
the
new
encampment
of
the
tribe
the
brilliant
appearance
of
moowis
caused
him
to
be
received
by
all
with
the
most
marked
distinction
the
chieftain
of
the
tribe
begged
him
to
enter
his
lodge
and
entertained
him
as
an
honoured
guest
but
none
was
so
struck
by
the
bearing
of
the
stranger
as
handsome
her
mother
requested
him
to
accept
the
hospitality
of
her
lodge
which
he
duly
graced
with
his
presence
but
being
unable
to
approach
too
closely
to
the
hearth
on
which
a
great
fire
was
burning
he
placed
a
boy
between
him
and
the
blaze
in
order
that
he
should
run
no
risk
of
melting
soon
the
news
that
moowis
was
to
wed
handsome
ran
through
the
encampment
and
the
nuptials
were
celebrated
on
the
following
day
moowis
announced
his
intention
of
undertaking
a
long
journey
handsome
pleaded
for
leave
to
accompany
him
but
he
refused
on
the
ground
that
the
distance
was
too
great
and
that
the
fatigues
and
dangers
of
the
route
would
prove
too
much
for
her
strength
finally
however
she
overcame
his
resistance
and
the
two
set
out
a
strange
transformation
a
rough
and
rugged
road
had
to
be
traversed
by
the
newly
wedded
pair
on
every
hand
they
encountered
obstacles
and
the
unfortunate
handsome
whose
feet
were
cut
and
bleeding
found
the
greatest
difficulty
in
keeping
up
with
her
more
active
husband
at
first
it
was
bitterly
cold
but
at
length
the
sun
came
out
and
shone
in
all
his
strength
so
that
the
girl
forgot
her
woes
and
began
to
sing
gaily
but
on
the
appearance
of
the
luminary
a
strange
transformation
had
slowly
overtaken
her
spouse
at
first
he
attempted
to
keep
in
the
shade
to
avoid
the
golden
beams
that
he
knew
meant
death
to
him
but
all
to
no
purpose
the
air
became
gradually
warmer
and
slowly
he
dissolved
and
fell
to
pieces
so
that
his
frenzied
wife
now
only
beheld
his
garments
the
bones
that
had
composed
his
framework
and
the
gaudy
plumes
and
beads
with
which
he
had
been
bedecked
long
she
sought
his
real
self
thinking
that
some
trick
had
been
played
upon
her
but
at
length
exhausted
with
fatigue
and
sorrow
she
cast
herself
on
the
ground
and
with
his
name
on
her
lips
breathed
her
last
so
was
elegant
avenged
the
a
story
is
told
of
a
young
algonquin
brave
whose
bride
died
on
the
day
fixed
for
their
wedding
before
this
sad
event
he
had
been
the
most
courageous
and
of
warriors
and
the
most
skilful
of
hunters
but
afterward
his
pride
and
his
bravery
seemed
to
desert
him
in
vain
his
friends
urged
him
to
seek
the
chase
and
begged
him
to
take
a
greater
interest
in
life
the
more
they
pressed
him
the
more
melancholy
he
became
till
at
length
he
passed
most
of
his
time
by
the
grave
of
his
bride
illustration
moowis
had
melted
in
the
sun
he
was
roused
from
his
state
of
apathy
one
day
however
by
hearing
some
old
men
discussing
the
existence
of
a
path
to
the
which
they
supposed
lay
to
the
south
a
gleam
of
hope
shone
in
the
young
brave
breast
and
worn
with
sorrow
as
he
was
he
armed
himself
and
set
off
southward
for
a
long
time
he
saw
no
appreciable
change
in
his
surroundings
rivers
mountains
lakes
and
forests
similar
to
those
of
his
own
country
environed
him
but
after
a
weary
journey
of
many
days
he
fancied
he
saw
a
difference
the
sky
was
more
blue
the
prairie
more
fertile
the
scenery
more
gloriously
beautiful
from
the
conversation
he
had
overheard
before
he
set
out
the
young
brave
judged
that
he
was
nearing
the
just
as
he
emerged
from
a
spreading
forest
he
saw
before
him
a
little
lodge
set
high
on
a
hill
thinking
its
occupants
might
be
able
to
direct
him
to
his
destination
he
climbed
to
the
lodge
and
accosted
an
aged
man
who
stood
in
the
doorway
can
you
tell
me
the
way
to
the
he
inquired
the
island
of
the
blessed
yes
said
the
old
man
gravely
throwing
aside
his
cloak
of
skin
only
a
few
days
ago
she
whom
you
seek
rested
in
my
lodge
if
you
will
leave
your
body
here
you
may
follow
her
to
reach
the
island
of
the
blessed
you
must
cross
yonder
gulf
you
see
in
the
distance
but
i
warn
you
the
crossing
will
be
no
easy
matter
do
you
still
wish
to
go
oh
yes
yes
cried
the
warrior
eagerly
and
as
the
words
were
uttered
he
felt
himself
grow
suddenly
lighter
the
whole
aspect
too
of
the
scene
was
changed
everything
looked
brighter
and
more
ethereal
he
found
himself
in
a
moment
walking
through
thickets
which
offered
no
resistance
to
his
passage
and
he
knew
that
he
was
a
spirit
travelling
in
the
when
he
reached
the
gulf
which
the
old
man
had
indicated
he
found
to
his
delight
a
wonderful
canoe
ready
on
the
shore
it
was
cut
from
a
single
white
stone
and
shone
and
sparkled
in
the
sun
like
a
jewel
the
warrior
lost
no
time
in
embarking
and
as
he
put
off
from
the
shore
he
saw
his
pretty
bride
enter
just
such
another
canoe
as
his
and
imitate
all
his
movements
side
by
side
they
made
for
the
island
of
the
blessed
a
charming
woody
islet
set
in
the
middle
of
the
water
like
an
emerald
in
silver
when
they
were
about
across
a
sudden
storm
arose
and
the
huge
waves
threatened
to
engulf
them
many
other
people
had
embarked
on
the
perilous
waters
by
this
time
some
of
whom
perished
in
the
furious
tempest
but
the
youth
and
maiden
still
battled
on
bravely
never
losing
sight
of
one
another
because
they
were
good
and
innocent
the
master
of
life
had
decreed
that
they
should
arrive
safely
at
the
fair
island
and
after
a
weary
struggle
they
felt
their
canoes
grate
on
the
shore
hand
in
hand
the
lovers
walked
among
the
beautiful
sights
and
sounds
that
greeted
their
eyes
and
ears
from
every
quarter
there
was
no
trace
of
the
recent
storm
the
sea
was
as
smooth
as
glass
and
the
sky
as
clear
as
crystal
the
youth
and
his
bride
felt
that
they
could
wander
on
thus
for
ever
but
at
length
a
faint
sweet
voice
bade
the
former
return
to
his
home
in
the
the
master
of
life
you
must
finish
your
mortal
course
it
whispered
softly
you
will
become
a
great
chief
among
your
own
people
rule
wisely
and
well
and
when
your
earthly
career
is
over
you
shall
return
to
your
bride
who
will
retain
her
youth
and
beauty
for
ever
the
young
man
recognized
the
voice
as
that
of
the
master
of
life
and
sadly
bade
farewell
to
the
woman
he
was
not
without
hope
now
however
but
looked
forward
to
another
and
more
lasting
reunion
returning
to
the
old
man
lodge
he
regained
his
body
went
home
as
the
gentle
voice
on
the
island
had
commanded
him
and
became
a
father
to
his
people
for
many
years
by
his
just
and
kindly
rule
he
won
the
hearts
of
all
who
knew
him
and
ensured
for
himself
a
safe
passage
to
the
island
of
the
blessed
where
he
arrived
at
last
to
partake
of
everlasting
happiness
with
his
beautiful
bride
in
the
heart
of
a
great
forest
lay
a
nameless
little
lake
and
by
its
side
dwelt
two
children
wicked
magicians
had
slain
their
parents
while
they
were
yet
of
tender
years
and
the
little
orphans
were
obliged
to
fend
for
themselves
the
younger
of
the
two
a
boy
learned
to
shoot
with
bow
and
arrow
and
he
soon
acquired
such
skill
that
he
rarely
returned
from
a
hunting
expedition
without
a
specimen
of
his
prowess
in
the
shape
of
a
bird
or
a
hare
which
his
elder
sister
would
dress
and
cook
when
the
boy
grew
older
he
naturally
felt
the
need
of
some
companionship
other
than
that
of
his
sister
during
his
long
solitary
journeys
in
search
of
food
he
thought
a
good
deal
about
the
great
world
outside
the
barrier
of
the
still
silent
forest
he
longed
for
the
sound
of
human
voices
to
replace
the
murmuring
of
the
trees
and
the
cries
of
the
birds
are
there
no
indians
but
ourselves
in
the
whole
world
he
would
ask
wistfully
i
do
not
know
his
sister
invariably
replied
busying
herself
cheerfully
about
her
household
tasks
she
knew
nothing
of
the
strange
thoughts
that
were
stirring
in
the
mind
of
her
brother
but
one
day
he
returned
from
the
chase
in
so
discontented
a
mood
that
his
unrest
could
no
longer
pass
unnoticed
in
response
to
solicitous
inquiries
from
his
sister
he
said
abruptly
make
me
ten
pairs
of
moccasins
i
am
going
to
travel
into
the
great
world
the
girl
was
much
disturbed
by
this
communication
but
like
a
good
indian
maiden
she
did
as
he
requested
her
and
kept
a
respectful
silence
early
on
the
following
morning
the
youth
whose
name
was
set
out
on
his
quest
he
soon
came
to
a
clearing
in
the
forest
but
to
his
disappointment
he
found
that
the
were
old
and
rotten
it
is
a
long
long
time
he
said
mournfully
since
there
were
indians
here
in
order
that
he
might
find
his
way
back
he
suspended
a
pair
of
moccasins
from
the
branch
of
a
tree
and
continued
his
journey
other
clearings
he
reached
in
due
time
each
showing
traces
of
a
more
recent
occupation
than
the
last
but
still
it
seemed
to
him
that
a
long
time
must
have
elapsed
since
the
trees
were
cut
down
so
he
hung
up
a
pair
of
moccasins
at
each
stage
of
his
journey
and
pursued
his
course
in
search
of
human
beings
at
last
he
saw
before
him
an
indian
village
which
he
approached
with
mingled
feelings
of
pleasure
and
trepidation
natural
enough
when
it
is
remembered
that
since
his
early
childhood
he
had
spoken
to
no
one
but
his
sister
the
on
the
outskirts
of
the
village
some
youths
of
about
his
own
age
were
engaged
in
a
game
of
ball
in
which
they
courteously
invited
the
stranger
to
join
very
soon
he
had
forgotten
his
natural
shyness
so
far
as
to
enter
into
the
sport
with
zest
and
enjoyment
his
new
companions
for
their
part
were
filled
with
astonishment
at
his
skill
and
agility
and
wishing
to
do
him
honour
led
him
to
the
great
lodge
and
introduced
him
to
their
chief
now
the
chief
had
two
daughters
one
of
whom
was
surnamed
good
and
the
other
wicked
to
the
guest
the
names
sounded
rather
suggestive
and
he
was
not
a
little
embarrassed
when
the
chief
begged
him
to
marry
the
maidens
i
will
marry
good
he
declared
but
the
chief
would
not
agree
to
that
you
must
marry
both
he
said
firmly
here
was
a
dilemma
for
our
hero
who
had
no
wish
to
wed
the
cross
ugly
sister
he
tried
hard
to
think
of
a
way
of
escape
i
am
going
to
visit
he
said
at
last
mentioning
the
name
of
one
of
his
companions
at
ball
and
he
dressed
himself
carefully
as
though
he
were
about
to
pay
a
ceremonious
visit
directly
he
was
out
of
sight
of
the
chief
lodge
however
he
took
to
his
heels
and
ran
into
the
forest
as
hard
as
he
could
meanwhile
the
maidens
sat
waiting
their
intended
bridegroom
when
some
hours
passed
without
there
being
any
signs
of
his
coming
they
became
alarmed
and
set
off
to
look
for
him
toward
nightfall
the
young
relaxed
his
speed
i
am
quite
safe
now
he
thought
he
did
not
know
that
the
sisters
had
the
resources
of
magic
at
their
command
suddenly
he
heard
wild
laughter
behind
him
recognizing
the
shrill
voice
of
the
wicked
he
knew
that
he
was
discovered
and
cast
about
for
a
refuge
the
only
likely
place
was
in
the
branches
of
a
dense
and
almost
as
soon
as
the
thought
entered
his
mind
he
was
at
the
top
his
satisfaction
was
in
a
moment
the
laughter
of
the
women
broke
out
anew
and
they
commenced
to
hew
down
the
tree
but
himself
was
not
without
some
acquaintance
with
magic
art
plucking
a
small
from
the
he
threw
it
into
the
air
jumped
astride
it
and
rode
down
the
wind
for
half
a
mile
or
more
the
sisters
absorbed
in
their
task
of
cutting
down
the
tree
did
not
notice
that
their
bird
was
flown
when
at
last
the
great
fir
crashed
to
the
ground
and
the
youth
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
the
pursuers
tore
their
hair
in
rage
and
disappointment
stratagem
only
on
the
following
evening
did
they
overtake
again
this
time
he
had
entered
a
hollow
the
hard
wood
of
which
he
thought
would
defy
their
axes
but
he
had
the
energy
of
the
sisters
in
a
short
time
the
tree
showed
the
effect
of
their
blows
and
called
on
his
guardian
spirit
to
break
one
of
the
axes
his
wish
was
promptly
gratified
but
the
other
sister
continued
her
labours
with
increased
energy
now
wished
that
the
other
axe
might
break
and
again
his
desire
was
fulfilled
the
sisters
were
at
a
loss
to
know
what
to
do
we
can
not
take
him
by
force
said
one
we
must
take
him
by
subtlety
let
each
do
her
best
and
the
one
who
gets
him
can
keep
him
so
they
departed
and
was
free
to
emerge
from
his
prison
he
travelled
another
day
journey
from
the
spot
and
at
last
reaching
a
place
where
he
thought
he
would
be
safe
he
laid
down
his
blanket
and
went
in
search
of
food
fortune
favoured
the
hunter
and
he
shortly
returned
with
a
fine
beaver
what
was
his
amazement
when
he
beheld
a
handsome
lodge
where
he
had
left
his
blanket
it
must
be
those
women
again
he
muttered
preparing
to
fly
but
the
light
shone
so
warmly
from
the
lodge
and
he
was
so
tired
and
hungry
that
he
conquered
his
fears
and
entered
within
he
found
a
tall
thin
woman
pale
and
but
rather
pretty
taking
the
beaver
she
proceeded
to
cook
it
as
she
did
so
noticed
that
she
ate
all
the
best
parts
herself
and
when
the
meal
was
set
out
only
the
poorest
pieces
remained
for
him
this
was
so
unlike
an
indian
housewife
that
he
cast
reproaches
at
her
and
accused
her
of
greediness
as
he
spoke
a
curious
change
came
over
her
her
features
grew
longer
and
thinner
in
a
moment
she
had
turned
into
a
wolf
and
slunk
into
the
forest
it
was
the
wicked
who
had
made
herself
pretty
by
means
of
magic
but
could
not
conceal
her
voracious
nature
was
glad
to
have
found
her
out
he
journeyed
on
still
farther
laid
down
his
blanket
and
went
to
look
for
game
this
time
several
beavers
rewarded
his
skill
and
he
carried
them
to
the
place
where
he
had
left
his
blanket
another
handsome
lodge
had
been
erected
there
more
than
ever
he
wanted
to
run
away
but
once
more
his
hunger
and
fatigue
detained
him
illustration
he
rode
down
the
wind
perhaps
it
is
the
good
he
said
i
shall
go
inside
and
if
she
has
laid
my
blanket
near
her
couch
i
shall
take
it
for
a
sign
and
she
shall
become
my
wife
the
he
entered
the
lodge
and
found
a
small
pretty
woman
busily
engaged
in
household
duties
sure
enough
she
had
laid
his
blanket
near
her
couch
when
she
had
dressed
and
cooked
the
beavers
she
gave
the
finest
morsels
to
her
husband
who
was
thoroughly
pleased
with
his
wife
hearing
a
sound
in
the
night
awoke
and
fancied
he
saw
his
wife
chewing
when
he
told
her
of
the
dream
in
the
morning
she
did
not
laugh
but
looked
very
serious
tell
me
asked
why
did
you
examine
the
beavers
so
closely
yesterday
they
were
my
relatives
she
replied
my
cousin
my
aunt
and
my
was
more
than
ever
delighted
for
the
otters
his
and
the
beavers
had
always
been
on
very
good
terms
he
promised
never
to
kill
any
more
beavers
but
only
deer
and
birds
and
he
and
his
wife
the
good
lived
together
very
happily
for
a
long
time
the
fairy
wives
once
upon
a
time
there
dwelt
in
the
forest
two
braves
one
of
whom
was
called
the
moose
and
the
other
the
marten
moose
was
a
great
hunter
and
never
returned
from
the
chase
without
a
fine
deer
or
buffalo
which
he
would
give
to
his
old
grandmother
to
prepare
for
cooking
marten
on
the
other
hand
was
an
idler
and
never
hunted
at
all
if
he
could
obtain
food
by
any
other
means
when
moose
brought
home
a
trophy
of
his
skill
in
the
hunt
marten
would
repair
to
his
friend
lodge
and
beg
for
a
portion
of
the
meat
being
a
fellow
moose
generally
gave
him
what
he
asked
for
to
the
indignation
of
the
old
grandmother
who
declared
that
the
lazy
creature
had
much
better
learn
to
work
for
himself
do
not
encourage
his
idle
habits
said
she
to
her
grandson
if
you
stop
giving
him
food
he
will
go
and
hunt
for
himself
moose
agreed
with
the
old
woman
and
having
on
his
next
expedition
killed
a
bear
he
told
the
grandmother
to
hide
it
so
that
marten
might
know
nothing
of
it
when
the
time
came
to
cook
the
however
the
grandmother
found
that
her
kettle
would
not
hold
water
and
remembering
that
marten
had
just
got
a
nice
new
kettle
she
went
to
borrow
his
i
will
clean
it
well
before
i
return
it
she
thought
he
will
never
know
what
i
want
it
for
but
marten
made
a
very
good
guess
so
he
laid
a
spell
on
the
kettle
before
lending
it
and
afterward
set
out
for
moose
lodge
looking
in
he
beheld
a
great
quantity
of
i
shall
have
a
fine
feast
said
he
laughing
as
he
stole
quietly
away
without
being
seen
on
the
following
day
the
old
grandmother
of
moose
took
the
borrowed
kettle
cleaned
it
carefully
and
carried
it
to
its
owner
she
never
dreamed
that
he
would
suspect
anything
oh
said
marten
what
a
fine
kettleful
of
you
have
brought
me
i
have
brought
you
nothing
the
old
woman
began
in
astonishment
but
a
glance
at
her
kettle
showed
her
that
it
was
full
of
steaming
she
was
much
confused
and
knew
that
marten
had
discovered
her
plot
by
magic
art
moose
demands
a
wife
though
marten
was
by
no
means
so
brave
or
so
industrious
as
moose
he
nevertheless
had
two
very
beautiful
wives
while
his
companion
had
not
even
one
moose
thought
this
rather
unfair
so
he
ventured
to
ask
marten
for
one
of
his
wives
to
this
marten
would
not
agree
nor
would
either
of
the
women
consent
to
be
handed
over
to
moose
so
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
that
the
braves
should
fight
for
the
wives
who
all
unknown
to
their
husband
were
fairies
and
fight
they
did
that
day
and
the
next
and
the
next
till
it
grew
to
be
a
habit
with
them
and
they
fought
as
regularly
as
they
slept
in
the
morning
moose
would
say
give
me
one
of
your
wives
paddle
your
own
canoe
marten
would
retort
and
the
fight
would
begin
next
morning
moose
would
say
again
give
me
one
of
your
wives
fish
for
your
own
minnows
the
reply
would
come
and
the
quarrel
would
be
continued
with
tomahawks
for
arguments
give
me
one
of
your
wives
moose
persisted
skin
your
own
rabbits
meanwhile
the
wives
of
marten
had
grown
tired
of
the
perpetual
skirmishing
so
they
made
up
their
minds
to
run
away
moose
and
marten
never
missed
them
they
were
too
busy
righting
all
day
the
fairy
wives
whose
name
was
weasel
travelled
as
fast
as
they
could
for
they
did
not
want
to
be
caught
but
when
night
came
they
lay
down
on
the
banks
of
a
stream
and
watched
the
stars
shining
through
the
if
you
were
a
said
one
and
wished
to
marry
a
star
which
one
would
you
choose
i
would
marry
that
bright
little
red
one
said
the
other
i
am
sure
he
must
be
a
merry
little
fellow
i
said
her
companion
should
like
to
marry
that
big
yellow
one
i
think
he
must
be
a
great
warrior
and
so
saying
she
fell
asleep
the
red
star
and
the
yellow
star
when
they
awoke
in
the
morning
the
fairies
found
that
their
wishes
were
fulfilled
one
was
the
wife
of
the
great
yellow
star
and
the
other
the
wife
of
the
little
red
one
this
was
the
work
of
an
indian
spirit
whose
duty
it
is
to
punish
unfaithful
wives
and
who
had
overheard
their
remarks
on
the
previous
night
knowing
that
the
fulfilment
of
their
wishes
would
be
the
best
punishment
he
transported
them
to
the
where
they
were
wedded
to
the
stars
of
their
choice
and
punishment
it
was
for
the
yellow
star
was
a
fierce
warrior
who
frightened
his
wife
nearly
out
of
her
wits
and
the
red
star
was
an
irritable
old
man
and
his
wife
was
obliged
to
wait
on
him
hand
and
foot
before
very
long
the
fairies
found
their
life
in
the
exceedingly
irksome
and
they
wished
they
had
never
quitted
their
home
not
far
from
their
lodges
was
a
large
white
stone
which
their
husbands
had
forbidden
them
to
touch
but
which
their
curiosity
one
day
tempted
them
to
remove
far
below
they
saw
the
and
they
became
sadder
and
more
than
ever
the
whose
magic
powers
told
them
that
their
wives
had
been
disobedient
were
not
really
cruel
or
unkind
at
heart
so
they
decided
to
let
the
fairies
return
to
earth
we
do
not
want
wives
who
will
not
obey
they
said
so
you
may
go
to
your
own
country
if
you
will
be
obedient
once
the
fairies
joyfully
promised
to
do
whatever
was
required
of
them
if
they
might
return
home
very
well
the
stars
replied
you
must
sleep
and
in
the
morning
you
will
wake
and
hear
the
song
of
the
chickadee
but
do
not
open
your
eyes
then
you
will
hear
the
voice
of
the
still
you
must
not
rise
the
red
squirrel
also
you
shall
hear
but
the
success
of
our
scheme
depends
on
your
remaining
quiet
only
when
you
hear
the
striped
squirrel
you
may
get
up
the
return
to
earth
the
fairies
went
to
their
couch
and
slept
but
their
sleep
was
broken
by
impatience
in
the
morning
the
chickadee
woke
them
with
its
song
the
younger
fairy
eagerly
started
up
but
the
other
drew
her
back
let
us
wait
till
we
hear
the
striped
squirrel
said
she
when
the
red
squirrel
note
was
heard
the
younger
fairy
could
no
longer
curb
her
impatience
she
sprang
to
her
feet
dragging
her
companion
with
her
they
had
indeed
reached
the
but
in
a
way
that
helped
them
but
little
for
they
found
themselves
in
the
topmost
branches
of
the
highest
tree
in
the
forest
with
no
prospect
of
getting
down
in
vain
they
called
to
the
birds
and
animals
to
help
them
all
the
creatures
were
too
busy
to
pay
any
attention
to
their
plight
at
last
lox
the
wolverine
passed
under
the
tree
and
though
he
was
the
wickedest
of
the
animals
the
weasels
cried
to
him
for
help
if
you
will
promise
to
come
to
my
lodge
said
lox
i
will
help
you
we
will
build
lodges
for
you
cried
the
elder
fairy
who
had
been
thinking
of
a
way
of
escape
that
is
well
said
lox
i
will
take
you
down
while
he
was
descending
the
tree
with
the
younger
of
the
fairies
the
elder
one
wound
her
magic
in
the
branches
knotting
it
skilfully
so
that
the
task
of
undoing
it
would
be
no
light
one
when
she
in
her
turn
had
been
carried
to
the
ground
she
begged
lox
to
return
for
her
which
she
said
had
become
entangled
among
the
branches
pray
do
not
break
it
she
added
for
if
you
do
i
shall
have
no
good
fortune
the
escape
from
lox
once
more
lox
ascended
the
tall
pine
and
strove
with
the
knots
which
the
cunning
fairy
had
tied
meanwhile
the
weasels
built
him
a
wigwam
they
filled
it
with
thorns
and
briers
and
all
sorts
of
prickly
things
and
induced
their
friends
the
ants
and
hornets
to
make
their
nests
inside
so
long
did
lox
take
to
untie
the
knotted
that
when
he
came
down
it
was
quite
dark
he
was
in
a
very
bad
temper
and
pushed
his
way
angrily
into
the
new
lodge
all
the
little
creatures
attacked
him
instantly
the
ants
bit
him
the
thorns
pricked
him
so
that
he
cried
out
with
anger
and
pain
the
fairies
ran
away
as
fast
as
they
could
and
by
and
by
found
themselves
on
the
brink
of
a
wide
river
the
younger
sat
down
and
began
to
weep
thinking
that
lox
would
certainly
overtake
them
but
the
elder
was
more
resourceful
she
saw
the
crane
who
was
ferryman
standing
close
by
and
sang
a
very
sweet
song
in
praise
of
his
long
legs
and
soft
feathers
illustration
you
carry
us
over
the
river
she
asked
will
you
carry
us
over
the
river
she
asked
at
length
willingly
replied
the
crane
who
was
very
susceptible
to
flattery
and
he
ferried
them
across
the
river
they
were
just
in
time
scarcely
had
they
reached
the
opposite
bank
when
lox
appeared
on
the
scene
very
angry
and
out
of
breath
ferry
me
across
old
said
he
and
added
other
still
more
uncomplimentary
remarks
the
crane
was
furious
but
he
said
nothing
and
bore
lox
out
on
the
river
i
see
you
cried
lox
to
the
trembling
fairies
i
shall
have
you
soon
you
shall
not
wicked
one
said
the
crane
and
he
threw
lox
into
the
deepest
part
of
the
stream
the
fairies
turned
their
faces
homeward
and
saw
him
no
more
the
malicious
an
ojibway
or
chippeway
legend
tells
of
a
hunter
who
was
greatly
devoted
to
his
wife
as
a
proof
of
his
affection
he
presented
her
with
the
most
delicate
morsels
from
the
game
he
killed
this
aroused
the
jealousy
and
envy
of
his
mother
who
lived
with
them
and
who
imagined
that
these
little
attentions
should
be
paid
to
her
and
not
to
the
younger
woman
the
latter
quite
unaware
of
her
attitude
cooked
and
ate
the
gifts
her
husband
brought
her
being
a
woman
of
a
gentle
and
agreeable
disposition
who
spent
most
of
her
time
attending
to
her
household
duties
and
watching
over
her
child
and
a
little
orphan
boy
whom
she
had
adopted
she
tried
to
make
friends
with
the
old
dame
and
was
grieved
and
disappointed
when
the
latter
would
not
respond
to
her
advances
the
nursed
her
grievance
until
it
seemed
of
gigantic
proportions
her
heart
grew
blacker
and
blacker
against
her
wife
and
at
last
she
determined
to
kill
her
for
a
time
she
could
think
of
no
way
to
put
her
evil
intent
into
action
but
finally
she
hit
upon
a
plan
one
day
she
disappeared
from
the
lodge
and
returned
after
a
space
looking
very
happy
and
the
younger
woman
was
surprised
and
delighted
at
the
alteration
this
was
an
agreeably
different
person
from
the
nagging
old
creature
who
had
made
her
life
a
burden
the
old
woman
repeatedly
absented
herself
from
her
home
after
this
returning
on
each
occasion
with
a
pleased
and
contented
smile
on
her
wrinkled
face
by
and
by
the
wife
allowed
her
curiosity
to
get
the
better
of
her
and
she
asked
the
meaning
of
her
happiness
the
if
you
must
know
replied
the
old
woman
i
have
made
a
beautiful
swing
down
by
the
lake
and
always
when
i
swing
on
it
i
feel
so
well
and
happy
that
i
can
not
help
smiling
the
young
woman
begged
that
she
too
might
be
allowed
to
enjoy
the
swing
you
may
accompany
me
was
the
reply
but
next
day
the
old
woman
had
some
excuse
and
so
on
day
after
day
till
the
curiosity
of
her
son
wife
was
very
keen
thus
when
the
elder
woman
said
one
day
come
with
me
and
i
will
take
you
to
the
swing
tie
up
your
baby
and
leave
him
in
charge
of
the
orphan
the
other
complied
eagerly
and
was
ready
in
a
moment
to
go
with
her
when
they
reached
the
shores
of
the
lake
they
found
a
lithe
sapling
which
hung
over
the
water
here
is
my
swing
said
the
old
creature
and
she
cast
aside
her
robe
fastened
a
thong
to
her
waist
and
to
the
sapling
and
swung
far
over
the
lake
she
laughed
so
much
and
seemed
to
find
the
pastime
so
pleasant
that
her
was
more
anxious
than
ever
to
try
it
for
herself
let
me
tie
the
thong
for
you
said
the
old
woman
when
she
had
tired
of
swinging
her
companion
threw
off
her
robe
and
allowed
the
leather
thong
to
be
fastened
round
her
waist
when
all
was
ready
she
was
commanded
to
swing
out
over
the
water
she
went
fearlessly
but
as
she
did
so
the
jealous
old
cut
the
thong
and
she
fell
into
the
lake
the
old
creature
exulting
over
the
success
of
her
cruel
scheme
dressed
herself
in
her
victim
clothes
and
returned
to
the
lodge
but
the
baby
cried
and
refused
to
be
fed
by
her
and
the
orphan
boy
cried
too
for
the
young
woman
had
been
almost
a
mother
to
him
since
his
parents
had
died
where
is
the
baby
mother
he
asked
when
some
hours
had
passed
and
she
did
not
return
at
the
swing
replied
the
old
woman
roughly
when
the
hunter
returned
from
the
chase
he
brought
with
him
as
usual
some
morsels
of
game
for
his
wife
and
never
dreaming
that
the
woman
bending
over
the
child
might
not
be
she
he
gave
them
to
her
the
lodge
was
dark
for
it
was
evening
and
his
mother
wore
the
clothes
of
his
wife
and
imitated
her
voice
and
movements
so
that
his
error
was
not
surprising
greedily
she
seized
the
tender
pieces
of
meat
and
cooked
and
ate
them
the
heart
of
the
little
orphan
was
so
sore
that
he
could
not
sleep
in
the
middle
of
the
night
he
rose
and
went
to
look
for
his
down
by
the
lake
he
found
the
swing
with
the
thong
cut
and
he
knew
that
she
had
been
killed
crying
bitterly
he
crept
home
to
his
couch
and
in
the
morning
told
the
hunter
all
that
he
had
seen
say
nothing
said
the
chief
but
come
with
me
to
hunt
and
in
the
evening
return
to
the
shores
of
the
lake
with
the
child
while
i
pray
to
manitou
that
he
may
send
me
back
my
wife
the
silver
girdle
so
they
went
off
in
search
of
game
without
a
word
to
the
old
woman
nor
did
they
stay
to
eat
but
set
out
directly
it
was
light
at
sunset
they
made
their
way
to
the
the
little
orphan
carrying
the
baby
here
the
hunter
blackened
his
face
and
prayed
earnestly
that
the
great
manitou
might
send
back
his
wife
while
he
prayed
the
orphan
amused
the
child
by
singing
quaint
little
songs
but
at
last
the
baby
grew
weary
and
hungry
and
began
to
cry
far
in
the
lake
his
mother
heard
the
sound
and
skimmed
over
the
water
in
the
shape
of
a
great
white
gull
when
she
touched
the
shore
she
became
a
woman
again
and
hugged
the
child
to
her
heart
content
the
orphan
boy
besought
her
to
return
to
them
alas
said
she
i
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
water
manitou
and
he
has
wound
his
silver
tail
about
me
so
that
i
never
can
escape
as
she
spoke
the
little
lad
saw
that
her
waist
was
encircled
by
a
band
of
gleaming
silver
one
end
of
which
was
in
the
water
at
length
she
declared
that
it
was
time
for
her
to
return
to
the
home
of
the
and
after
having
exacted
a
promise
from
the
boy
that
he
would
bring
her
baby
there
every
day
she
became
a
gull
again
and
flew
away
the
hunter
was
informed
of
all
that
had
passed
and
straightway
determined
that
he
would
be
present
on
the
following
evening
all
next
day
he
fasted
and
besought
the
of
manitou
and
when
the
night
began
to
fall
he
hid
himself
on
the
shore
till
his
wife
appeared
hastily
emerging
from
his
concealment
the
hunter
poised
his
spear
and
struck
the
girdle
with
all
his
force
the
silver
band
parted
and
the
woman
was
free
to
return
home
with
her
husband
illustration
he
poised
his
spear
and
struck
the
girdle
overjoyed
at
her
restoration
he
led
her
gently
to
the
lodge
where
his
mother
was
sitting
by
the
fire
at
the
sight
of
her
whom
she
thought
she
had
drowned
in
the
lake
she
started
up
in
such
fear
and
astonishment
that
she
tripped
overbalanced
and
fell
into
the
fire
before
they
could
pull
her
out
the
flames
had
risen
to
the
and
when
the
fire
died
down
no
woman
was
there
but
a
great
black
bird
which
rose
slowly
from
the
smoking
embers
flew
out
of
the
lodge
and
was
never
seen
again
as
for
the
others
they
lived
long
and
happily
undisturbed
by
the
jealousy
and
hatred
of
the
malicious
crone
the
maize
spirit
the
chippeways
tell
a
charming
story
concerning
the
origin
of
the
zea
maize
which
runs
as
follows
a
lad
of
fourteen
or
fifteen
dwelt
with
his
parents
brothers
and
sisters
in
a
beautifully
situated
little
lodge
the
family
though
poor
were
very
happy
and
contented
the
father
was
a
hunter
who
was
not
lacking
in
courage
and
skill
but
there
were
times
when
he
could
scarcely
supply
the
wants
of
his
family
and
as
none
of
his
children
was
old
enough
to
help
him
things
went
hardly
with
them
then
the
lad
was
of
a
cheerful
and
contented
disposition
like
his
father
and
his
great
desire
was
to
benefit
his
people
the
time
had
come
for
him
to
observe
the
initial
fast
prescribed
for
all
indian
boys
of
his
age
and
his
mother
made
him
a
little
in
a
remote
spot
where
he
might
not
suffer
interruption
during
his
ordeal
thither
the
boy
repaired
meditating
on
the
goodness
of
the
great
spirit
who
had
made
all
things
beautiful
in
the
fields
and
forests
for
the
enjoyment
of
man
the
desire
to
help
his
fellows
was
strong
upon
him
and
he
prayed
that
some
means
to
that
end
might
be
revealed
to
him
in
a
dream
on
the
third
day
of
his
fast
he
was
too
weak
to
ramble
through
the
forest
and
as
he
lay
in
a
state
between
sleeping
and
waking
there
came
toward
him
a
beautiful
youth
richly
dressed
in
green
robes
and
wearing
on
his
head
wonderful
green
plumes
the
great
spirit
has
heard
your
prayers
said
the
youth
and
his
voice
was
like
the
sound
of
the
wind
sighing
through
the
grass
hearken
to
me
and
you
shall
have
your
desire
fulfilled
arise
and
wrestle
with
me
the
struggle
the
lad
obeyed
though
his
limbs
were
weak
his
brain
was
clear
and
active
and
he
felt
he
could
not
but
obey
the
stranger
after
a
long
silent
struggle
the
latter
said
that
will
do
for
i
shall
come
again
the
lad
lay
back
exhausted
but
on
the
morrow
the
stranger
reappeared
and
the
conflict
was
renewed
as
the
struggle
went
on
the
youth
felt
himself
grow
stronger
and
more
confident
and
before
leaving
him
for
the
second
time
the
supernatural
visitor
offered
him
some
words
of
praise
and
encouragement
on
the
third
day
the
youth
pale
and
feeble
was
again
summoned
to
the
contest
as
he
grasped
his
opponent
the
very
contact
seemed
to
give
him
new
strength
and
he
fought
more
and
more
bravely
till
his
lithe
companion
was
forced
to
cry
out
that
he
had
had
enough
ere
he
took
his
departure
the
visitor
told
the
lad
that
the
following
day
would
put
an
end
to
his
trials
said
he
your
father
will
bring
you
food
and
that
will
help
you
in
the
evening
i
shall
come
and
wrestle
with
you
i
know
that
you
are
destined
to
succeed
and
to
obtain
your
heart
desire
when
you
have
thrown
me
strip
off
my
garments
and
plumes
bury
me
where
i
fall
and
keep
the
earth
above
me
moist
and
clean
once
a
month
let
my
remains
be
covered
with
fresh
earth
and
you
shall
see
me
again
clothed
in
my
green
garments
and
plumes
so
saying
he
vanished
the
final
contest
next
day
the
lad
father
brought
him
food
the
youth
however
begged
that
it
might
be
set
aside
till
evening
once
again
the
stranger
appeared
though
he
had
eaten
nothing
the
hero
strength
as
before
seemed
to
increase
as
he
struggled
and
at
length
he
threw
his
opponent
then
he
stripped
off
his
garments
and
plumes
and
buried
him
in
the
earth
not
without
sorrow
in
his
heart
for
the
slaying
of
such
a
beautiful
youth
his
task
done
he
returned
to
his
parents
and
soon
recovered
his
full
strength
but
he
never
forgot
the
grave
of
his
friend
not
a
weed
was
allowed
to
grow
on
it
and
finally
he
was
rewarded
by
seeing
the
green
plumes
rise
above
the
earth
and
broaden
out
into
graceful
leaves
when
the
autumn
came
he
requested
his
father
to
accompany
him
to
the
place
by
this
time
the
plant
was
at
its
full
height
tall
and
beautiful
with
waving
leaves
and
golden
tassels
the
elder
man
was
filled
with
surprise
and
admiration
it
is
my
friend
murmured
the
youth
the
friend
of
my
dreams
it
is
said
his
father
the
spirit
grain
the
gift
of
the
great
spirit
and
in
this
manner
was
maize
given
to
the
indians
the
seven
brothers
the
blackfeet
have
a
curious
legend
in
explanation
of
the
constellation
known
as
the
plough
or
great
bear
once
there
dwelt
together
nine
children
seven
boys
and
two
girls
while
the
six
older
brothers
were
away
on
the
the
elder
daughter
whose
name
was
married
a
grizzly
bear
her
father
was
so
enraged
that
he
collected
his
friends
and
ordered
them
to
surround
the
grizzly
cave
and
slay
him
when
the
girl
heard
that
her
spouse
had
been
killed
she
took
a
piece
of
his
skin
and
wore
it
as
an
amulet
through
the
agency
of
her
husband
supernatural
power
one
dark
night
she
was
changed
into
a
grizzly
bear
and
rushed
through
the
camp
killing
and
rending
the
people
even
her
own
father
and
mother
sparing
only
her
youngest
brother
and
her
sister
okinai
and
sinopa
she
then
took
her
former
shape
and
returned
to
the
lodge
occupied
by
the
two
orphans
who
were
greatly
terrified
when
they
heard
her
muttering
to
herself
planning
their
deaths
sinopa
had
gone
to
the
river
one
day
when
she
met
her
six
brothers
returning
from
the
she
told
them
what
had
happened
in
their
absence
they
reassured
her
and
bade
her
gather
a
large
number
of
prickly
pears
these
she
was
to
strew
in
front
of
the
lodge
leaving
only
a
small
path
uncovered
by
them
in
the
dead
of
night
okinai
and
sinopa
crept
out
of
the
lodge
picking
their
way
down
the
little
path
that
was
free
from
the
prickly
pears
and
meeting
their
six
brothers
who
were
awaiting
them
the
heard
them
leaving
the
lodge
and
rushed
out
into
the
open
only
to
tread
on
the
prickly
pears
roaring
with
pain
and
anger
she
immediately
assumed
her
bear
shape
and
rushed
furiously
at
her
brothers
but
okinai
rose
to
the
occasion
he
shot
an
arrow
into
the
air
and
so
far
as
it
flew
the
brothers
and
sister
found
themselves
just
that
distance
in
front
of
the
savage
animal
behind
them
the
chase
the
beast
gained
on
them
however
but
okinai
waved
a
magic
feather
and
thick
underbrush
rose
in
its
path
again
made
headway
okinai
caused
a
lake
to
spring
up
before
her
yet
again
she
neared
the
brothers
and
sister
and
this
time
okinai
raised
a
great
tree
into
which
the
refugees
climbed
the
however
succeeded
in
dragging
four
of
the
brothers
from
the
tree
when
okinai
shot
an
arrow
into
the
air
immediately
his
little
sister
sailed
into
the
sky
six
times
more
he
shot
an
arrow
and
each
time
a
brother
went
up
okinai
himself
following
them
as
the
last
arrow
soared
into
the
blue
thus
the
orphans
became
stars
and
one
can
see
that
they
took
the
same
position
in
the
sky
as
they
had
occupied
in
the
tree
for
the
small
star
at
one
side
of
the
bunch
is
sinopa
while
the
four
who
huddle
together
at
the
bottom
are
those
who
had
been
dragged
from
the
branches
by
the
beaver
medicine
legend
two
brothers
dwelt
together
in
the
old
time
the
elder
who
was
named
nopatsis
was
married
to
a
woman
who
was
wholly
evil
and
who
hated
his
younger
brother
akaiyan
daily
the
wife
pestered
her
husband
to
be
rid
of
akaiyan
but
he
would
not
agree
to
part
with
his
only
brother
for
they
had
been
together
through
long
years
of
privation
indeed
since
their
parents
had
left
them
together
as
little
helpless
orphans
and
they
were
all
in
all
to
each
other
so
the
wife
of
nopatsis
had
resort
to
a
ruse
well
known
to
women
whose
hearts
are
evil
one
day
when
her
husband
returned
from
the
chase
he
found
her
lamenting
with
torn
clothes
and
disordered
appearance
she
told
him
that
akaiyan
had
treated
her
brutally
the
lie
entered
into
the
heart
of
nopatsis
and
made
it
heavy
so
that
in
time
he
conceived
a
hatred
of
his
innocent
brother
and
debated
with
himself
how
he
should
rid
himself
of
akaiyan
the
first
portion
of
this
legend
has
its
exact
counterpart
in
egyptian
story
see
wiedemann
literature
of
ancient
summer
arrived
and
with
it
the
moulting
season
when
the
wild
shed
their
feathers
with
which
the
indians
fledge
their
arrows
near
nopatsis
lodge
there
was
a
great
lake
to
which
these
birds
resorted
in
large
numbers
and
to
this
place
the
brothers
went
to
collect
feathers
with
which
to
plume
their
darts
they
built
a
raft
to
enable
them
to
reach
an
island
in
the
middle
of
the
lake
making
it
of
logs
bound
securely
with
embarking
they
sailed
to
the
little
island
along
the
shores
of
which
they
walked
looking
for
suitable
feathers
they
parted
in
the
quest
and
after
some
time
akaiyan
who
had
wandered
far
along
the
strand
suddenly
looked
up
to
see
his
brother
on
the
raft
sailing
toward
the
mainland
he
called
loudly
to
him
to
return
but
nopatsis
replied
that
he
deserved
to
perish
there
because
of
the
brutal
manner
in
which
he
had
treated
his
akaiyan
solemnly
swore
that
he
had
not
injured
her
in
any
way
but
nopatsis
only
jeered
at
him
and
rowed
away
soon
he
was
lost
to
sight
and
akaiyan
sat
down
and
wept
bitterly
he
prayed
earnestly
to
the
nature
spirits
and
to
the
sun
and
moon
after
which
he
felt
greatly
uplifted
then
he
improvised
a
shelter
of
branches
and
made
a
bed
of
feathers
of
the
most
comfortable
description
he
lived
well
on
the
ducks
and
geese
which
frequented
the
island
and
made
a
warm
robe
against
the
winter
season
from
their
skins
he
was
careful
also
to
preserve
many
of
the
tame
birds
for
his
winter
food
one
day
he
encountered
the
lodge
of
a
beaver
and
while
he
looked
at
it
curiously
he
became
aware
of
the
presence
of
a
little
beaver
my
father
desires
that
you
will
enter
his
dwelling
said
the
animal
so
akaiyan
accepted
the
invitation
and
entered
the
lodge
where
the
great
beaver
attended
by
his
wife
and
family
received
him
he
was
indeed
the
chief
of
all
the
beavers
and
white
with
the
snows
of
countless
winters
akaiyan
told
the
beaver
how
cruelly
he
had
been
treated
and
the
wise
animal
condoled
with
him
and
invited
him
to
spend
the
winter
in
his
lodge
when
he
would
learn
many
wonderful
and
useful
things
akaiyan
gratefully
accepted
the
invitation
and
when
the
beavers
closed
up
their
lodge
for
the
winter
he
remained
with
them
they
kept
him
warm
by
placing
their
thick
soft
tails
on
his
body
and
taught
him
the
secret
of
the
healing
art
the
use
of
tobacco
and
various
ceremonial
dances
songs
and
prayers
belonging
to
the
great
mystery
of
the
summer
returned
and
on
parting
the
beaver
asked
akaiyan
to
choose
a
gift
he
chose
the
beaver
youngest
child
with
whom
he
had
contracted
a
strong
friendship
but
the
father
prized
his
little
one
greatly
and
would
not
at
first
permit
him
to
go
at
length
however
great
beaver
gave
way
to
akaiyan
entreaties
and
allowed
him
to
take
little
beaver
with
him
counselling
him
to
construct
a
sacred
beaver
bundle
when
he
arrived
at
his
native
village
in
due
time
nopatsis
came
to
the
island
on
his
raft
and
making
sure
that
his
brother
was
dead
began
to
search
for
his
remains
but
while
he
searched
akaiyan
caught
up
little
beaver
in
his
arms
and
embarking
on
the
raft
made
for
the
mainland
espied
by
nopatsis
when
akaiyan
arrived
at
his
native
village
he
told
his
story
to
the
chief
gathered
a
beaver
bundle
and
commenced
to
teach
the
people
the
mystery
of
with
its
accompanying
songs
and
dances
then
he
invited
the
chiefs
of
the
animal
tribes
to
contribute
their
knowledge
to
the
beaver
medicine
which
many
of
them
did
having
accomplished
his
task
of
instruction
which
occupied
him
all
the
winter
akaiyan
returned
to
the
island
with
little
beaver
who
had
been
of
immense
service
to
him
in
teaching
the
indians
the
songs
and
dances
he
returned
little
beaver
to
his
parents
and
received
in
exchange
for
him
a
sacred
pipe
being
also
instructed
in
its
accompanying
songs
and
ceremonial
dances
on
the
island
he
found
the
bones
of
his
credulous
and
vengeful
brother
who
had
met
with
the
fate
he
had
purposed
for
the
innocent
akaiyan
every
spring
akaiyan
visited
the
beavers
and
as
regularly
he
received
something
to
add
to
the
beaver
medicine
bundle
until
it
reached
the
great
size
it
now
has
and
he
married
and
founded
a
race
of
who
have
handed
down
the
traditions
and
ceremonials
of
the
beaver
medicine
to
the
present
day
the
sacred
an
interesting
blackfoot
myth
relates
how
that
tribe
obtained
its
sacred
many
generations
ago
even
before
the
blackfeet
used
horses
as
beasts
of
burden
the
tribe
was
undertaking
its
autumn
migration
when
one
evening
before
striking
camp
for
the
night
it
was
reported
that
a
or
cart
belonging
to
the
chief
was
missing
to
make
matters
worse
the
chief
ermine
robe
and
his
wife
buckskin
dress
with
her
sacred
robe
had
been
packed
in
the
little
cart
strangely
enough
no
one
could
recollect
having
noticed
the
dog
during
the
march
messengers
were
dispatched
to
the
of
the
night
before
but
to
no
avail
at
last
the
chief
son
sokumapi
a
boy
about
twelve
years
of
age
begged
to
be
allowed
to
search
for
the
missing
dog
a
proposal
to
which
his
father
after
some
demur
consented
sokumapi
set
out
alone
for
the
last
which
was
under
the
shadows
of
the
rocky
mountains
and
carefully
examined
the
site
soon
he
found
a
single
track
leading
into
a
deep
gulch
near
the
entrance
to
which
he
discovered
a
large
cave
a
heap
of
freshly
turned
earth
stood
in
front
of
the
cave
beside
which
was
the
missing
cart
as
he
stood
looking
at
it
wondering
what
had
become
of
the
dog
which
had
drawn
it
an
immense
suddenly
dashed
out
so
rapid
was
its
attack
that
sokumapi
had
no
chance
either
to
defend
himself
or
to
take
refuge
in
flight
the
bear
giving
vent
to
the
most
terrific
roars
dragged
him
into
the
cave
hugging
him
with
such
force
that
he
fainted
when
he
regained
consciousness
it
was
to
find
the
bear
great
head
within
a
foot
of
his
own
and
he
thought
that
he
saw
a
kindly
and
almost
human
expression
in
its
big
brown
eyes
for
a
long
time
he
lay
still
until
at
last
to
his
intense
surprise
the
bear
broke
the
silence
by
addressing
him
in
human
speech
have
no
fear
said
the
grizzly
i
am
the
great
bear
and
my
power
is
extensive
i
know
the
circumstances
of
your
search
and
i
have
drawn
you
to
this
cavern
because
i
desired
to
assist
you
winter
is
upon
us
and
you
had
better
remain
with
me
during
the
cold
season
in
the
course
of
which
i
will
reveal
to
you
the
secret
of
my
supernatural
power
bear
magic
it
will
be
observed
that
the
circumstances
of
this
tale
are
almost
identical
with
those
which
relate
to
the
manner
in
which
the
beaver
medicine
was
revealed
to
mankind
the
hero
of
both
stories
remains
during
the
winter
with
the
animal
the
chief
of
its
species
who
in
the
period
of
hibernation
instructs
him
in
certain
potent
mysteries
the
bear
having
reassured
sokumapi
showed
him
how
to
transform
various
substances
into
food
his
strange
host
slept
during
most
of
the
winter
but
when
the
warm
winds
of
spring
returned
and
the
snows
melted
from
the
hills
the
grizzly
became
restless
and
told
sokumapi
that
it
was
time
to
leave
the
cave
before
they
quitted
it
however
he
taught
the
lad
the
secret
of
his
supernatural
power
among
other
things
he
showed
him
how
to
make
a
he
instructed
him
to
take
a
long
stick
to
one
end
of
which
he
must
secure
a
sharp
point
to
symbolize
the
bear
tusks
to
the
staff
must
be
attached
a
nose
and
teeth
while
the
rest
of
the
spear
was
to
be
covered
with
bear
skin
painted
the
sacred
colour
red
the
bear
also
told
him
to
decorate
the
handle
with
eagle
feathers
and
grizzly
claws
and
in
to
wear
a
grizzly
claw
in
his
hair
so
that
the
strength
of
the
great
bear
might
go
with
him
in
battle
and
to
imitate
the
noise
a
grizzly
makes
when
it
charges
the
bear
furthermore
instructed
him
what
songs
should
be
used
in
order
to
heal
the
sick
and
how
to
paint
his
face
and
body
so
that
he
would
be
invulnerable
in
battle
and
lastly
told
him
of
the
sacred
nature
of
the
spear
which
was
only
to
be
employed
in
warfare
and
for
curing
disease
thus
if
a
person
was
sick
unto
death
and
a
relative
purchased
the
its
supernatural
power
would
restore
the
ailing
man
to
health
equipped
with
this
knowledge
sokumapi
returned
to
his
people
who
had
long
mourned
him
as
dead
after
a
feast
had
been
given
to
celebrate
his
he
began
to
manufacture
the
as
directed
by
his
friend
how
the
magic
worked
shortly
after
his
return
the
crows
made
war
upon
the
blackfeet
and
on
the
meeting
of
the
two
tribes
in
battle
sokumapi
appeared
in
front
of
his
people
carrying
the
on
his
back
his
face
and
body
were
painted
as
the
great
bear
had
instructed
him
and
he
sang
the
that
the
grizzly
had
taught
him
after
these
ceremonies
he
impetuously
charged
the
enemy
followed
by
all
his
braves
in
a
solid
phalanx
and
such
was
the
efficacy
of
the
bear
magic
that
the
crows
immediately
took
to
flight
the
victorious
blackfeet
brought
back
sokumapi
to
their
camp
in
triumph
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
bear
songs
he
was
made
a
and
ever
afterward
the
spear
which
he
had
used
was
regarded
as
the
palladium
of
the
blackfoot
indians
in
the
spring
the
is
unrolled
from
its
covering
and
produced
when
the
first
thunder
is
heard
and
when
the
bear
begins
to
quit
his
winter
quarters
but
when
the
bear
returns
to
his
den
to
hibernate
the
spear
is
once
more
rolled
up
and
put
away
the
greatest
care
is
taken
to
protect
it
against
injury
it
has
a
special
guardian
and
no
woman
is
permitted
to
touch
it
the
young
dog
dance
a
dance
resembling
the
sun
dance
was
formerly
known
to
the
pawnee
indians
who
called
it
the
young
dog
dance
it
was
they
said
borrowed
from
the
crees
who
produced
the
following
myth
to
account
for
it
one
day
a
young
brave
of
the
cree
tribe
had
gone
out
from
his
village
to
catch
eagles
in
order
to
provide
himself
with
feathers
for
a
or
to
tie
in
his
hair
now
the
crees
caught
eagles
in
this
fashion
on
the
top
of
a
hill
frequented
by
these
birds
they
would
dig
a
pit
and
cover
it
over
with
a
roof
of
poles
cunningly
concealing
the
structure
with
grass
a
piece
of
meat
was
fastened
to
the
poles
so
that
the
eagles
could
not
carry
it
off
then
the
indian
taking
off
his
clothes
would
descend
into
the
pit
and
remain
there
for
hours
or
days
as
the
case
might
be
until
an
eagle
was
attracted
by
the
bait
when
he
would
put
his
hand
between
the
poles
seize
the
bird
by
the
feet
and
quickly
dispatch
it
the
young
brave
whose
fortune
it
was
to
discover
the
young
dog
dance
had
prepared
the
trap
in
this
wise
and
was
lying
in
the
pit
praying
that
an
eagle
might
come
and
bring
his
uncomfortable
vigil
to
an
end
suddenly
he
heard
a
sound
of
drumming
distant
but
quite
distinct
though
he
could
not
tell
from
what
direction
it
proceeded
all
night
the
mysterious
noise
continued
next
night
as
he
lay
in
the
same
position
he
heard
it
again
and
resolved
to
find
out
its
origin
so
he
clambered
out
of
his
pit
and
went
off
in
the
direction
from
which
the
seemed
to
proceed
at
last
when
dawn
was
near
he
reached
the
shores
of
a
great
lake
here
he
stopped
for
the
sounds
quite
evidently
came
from
the
lake
all
that
day
he
sat
by
the
water
bemoaning
his
and
praying
for
better
fortune
when
night
fell
the
drumming
began
anew
and
the
young
man
saw
countless
animals
and
birds
swimming
in
the
lake
four
days
he
remained
on
the
till
at
length
worn
out
by
fatigue
and
hunger
for
many
days
had
elapsed
since
he
had
eaten
he
fell
asleep
the
lodge
of
animals
when
he
awoke
he
found
himself
in
a
large
lodge
surrounded
by
many
people
some
of
whom
were
dancing
while
others
sat
round
the
walls
all
these
people
wore
robes
made
from
the
skins
of
various
animals
or
birds
they
were
in
fact
the
animals
the
young
indian
had
seen
swimming
in
the
water
who
had
changed
themselves
into
human
shape
a
chief
at
the
back
of
the
lodge
stood
up
and
addressed
him

lucky
in
war
and
he
imparted
the
nature
of
the
rite
to
the
indian
by
action
the
dog
turned
from
the
cree
brave
and
his
eye
swept
the
company
the
gift
brothers
he
said
i
have
given
him
my
power
will
you
not
pity
him
and
give
him
the
power
you
have
for
a
time
there
was
silence
no
one
seemed
disposed
to
respond
to
the
chief
appeal
at
last
the
owl
rose
i
will
help
you
he
said
to
the
young
man
i
have
power
to
see
in
the
dark
wherever
i
may
go
when
you
go
out
at
night
i
will
be
near
you
and
you
shall
see
as
well
as
i
do
take
these
feathers
and
tie
them
in
your
hair
and
giving
him
a
bunch
of
feathers
the
owl
sat
down
there
was
a
pause
and
the
next
to
rise
was
the
buffalo
bull
who
gave
to
the
young
indian
his
strength
and
endurance
and
the
power
to
trample
his
enemies
underfoot
as
a
token
he
gave
him
a
of
tanned
bidding
him
wear
it
when
he
went
on
the
by
and
by
the
porcupine
stood
up
and
addressed
the
guest
giving
him
some
of
his
quills
with
which
to
ornament
the
leather
belt
he
said
i
also
will
help
you
i
can
make
my
enemies
as
weak
as
women
so
that
they
fly
before
me
when
you
fight
your
foes
shall
flee
and
you
shall
overcome
them
another
long
silence
ensued
and
when
at
last
the
eagle
rose
every
one
listened
to
hear
what
he
had
to
say
i
also
he
said
majestically
will
be
with
you
wherever
you
go
and
will
give
you
my
prowess
in
war
so
that
you
may
kill
your
foes
as
i
do
as
he
spoke
he
handed
to
the
brave
some
eagle
feathers
to
tie
in
his
hair
the
whooping
crane
followed
and
gave
him
a
bone
from
its
wing
for
a
to
frighten
his
enemies
away
the
deer
and
the
bear
came
next
the
one
giving
him
swiftness
with
a
rattle
as
token
and
the
other
hardiness
and
a
strip
of
fur
for
his
belt
after
he
had
received
these
gifts
from
the
animals
the
brave
lay
down
and
fell
asleep
again
when
he
awoke
he
found
himself
on
the
shores
of
the
lake
once
more
returning
home
he
taught
the
crees
the
young
dog
dance
which
was
to
make
them
skilful
in
war
and
showed
them
the
articles
he
had
received
so
the
young
men
formed
a
society
of
young
dogs
which
practised
the
dance
and
obtained
the
benefits
the
medicine
wolf
a
quaint
story
of
a
wolf
is
told
among
the
blackfoot
indians
on
one
occasion
when
the
blackfeet
were
moving
camp
they
were
attacked
by
a
number
of
crow
indians
who
had
been
lying
in
wait
for
them
the
blackfeet
were
travelling
slowly
in
a
long
straggling
line
with
the
old
men
and
the
women
and
children
in
the
middle
and
a
band
of
warriors
in
front
and
in
the
rear
the
crows
as
has
been
said
made
an
ambush
for
their
enemies
and
rushed
out
on
the
middle
portion
of
the
line
before
either
party
of
the
blackfoot
warriors
could
reach
the
scene
of
the
struggle
many
of
the
women
and
children
had
perished
and
others
were
taken
captive
by
the
attacking
force
among
the
prisoners
was
a
young
woman
called
many
weary
miles
lay
between
them
and
the
crow
camp
on
the
yellowstone
river
but
at
length
the
tired
captives
mounted
with
their
captors
on
jaded
horses
arrived
at
their
destination
the
warrior
who
had
taken
prisoner
now
presented
her
to
a
friend
of
his
who
in
turn
gave
her
into
the
keeping
of
his
wife
who
was
somewhat
older
than
her
charge
the
young
blackfoot
woman
was
cruelly
treated
by
the
crow
into
whose
possession
she
had
passed
every
night
he
tied
her
feet
together
so
that
she
might
not
escape
and
also
tied
a
rope
round
her
waist
the
other
end
of
which
he
fastened
to
his
wife
the
crow
woman
however
was
not
unmoved
by
the
wretchedness
of
her
prisoner
while
her
husband
was
out
she
managed
to
converse
with
her
and
to
show
her
that
she
pitied
her
misfortunes
one
day
she
informed
that
she
had
overheard
her
husband
and
his
companions
plotting
to
kill
her
but
she
added
that
when
darkness
fell
she
would
help
her
to
escape
when
night
came
the
crow
woman
waited
until
the
deep
breathing
of
her
husband
told
her
that
he
was
sound
asleep
then
rising
cautiously
she
loosened
the
ropes
that
bound
her
captive
and
giving
her
a
pair
of
moccasins
a
flint
and
a
small
sack
of
pemmican
bade
her
make
haste
and
escape
from
the
fate
that
would
surely
befall
her
if
she
remained
where
she
was
the
trembling
woman
obeyed
and
travelled
at
a
good
pace
all
night
at
dawn
she
hid
in
the
dense
undergrowth
hoping
to
escape
observation
should
her
captors
pursue
her
they
meanwhile
had
discovered
her
absence
and
were
searching
high
and
low
but
no
tracks
were
visible
and
at
last
wearied
with
their
unprofitable
search
they
gave
up
the
chase
and
returned
to
their
homes
the
friendly
wolf
when
the
woman
had
journeyed
on
for
four
nights
she
stopped
concealing
herself
in
the
daytime
and
travelled
straight
on
she
was
not
yet
out
of
danger
however
for
her
supply
of
pemmican
was
soon
exhausted
and
she
found
herself
face
to
face
with
the
miseries
of
starvation
her
moccasins
besides
were
worn
to
holes
and
her
feet
were
cut
and
bleeding
while
to
add
to
her
misfortunes
a
huge
wolf
dogged
her
every
movement
in
vain
she
tried
to
run
away
her
strength
was
exhausted
and
she
sank
to
the
ground
nearer
and
nearer
came
the
great
wolf
and
at
last
he
lay
down
at
her
feet
whenever
the
woman
walked
on
her
way
the
wolf
followed
and
when
she
lay
down
to
rest
he
lay
down
also
at
length
she
begged
her
strange
companion
to
help
her
for
she
knew
that
unless
she
obtained
food
very
soon
she
must
die
the
animal
trotted
away
and
returned
shortly
with
a
buffalo
calf
which
it
had
killed
and
laid
it
at
the
woman
feet
with
the
aid
of
the
flint
one
of
the
gifts
with
which
the
crow
woman
had
sped
her
unhappy
guest
she
built
a
fire
and
cooked
some
of
the
buffalo
meat
thus
refreshed
she
proceeded
on
her
way
again
and
again
the
wolf
provided
food
in
a
similar
manner
until
at
length
they
reached
the
blackfoot
camp
the
woman
led
the
animal
into
her
lodge
and
related
to
her
friends
all
that
had
befallen
her
in
the
crow
camp
and
the
manner
of
her
escape
she
also
told
them
how
the
wolf
had
befriended
her
and
begged
them
to
treat
it
kindly
but
soon
afterward
she
fell
ill
and
the
poor
wolf
was
driven
out
of
the
village
by
the
indian
dogs
every
evening
he
would
come
to
the
top
of
a
hill
overlooking
the
camp
and
watch
the
lodge
where
dwelt
though
he
was
still
fed
by
her
friends
after
a
time
he
disappeared
and
was
seen
no
more
the
reader
can
not
fail
to
discern
the
striking
resemblance
between
this
episode
and
that
of
una
and
the
lion
in
spenser
the
story
of
was
brave
but
poor
his
parents
had
died
while
he
was
yet
a
boy
and
he
had
no
near
relations
but
his
heart
was
high
and
he
was
a
mighty
hunter
the
old
men
said
that
had
a
future
before
him
but
the
young
braves
twitted
him
because
of
a
mark
across
his
face
left
by
the
rending
claw
of
a
great
grizzly
which
he
had
slain
in
close
fight
the
chief
of
his
tribe
possessed
a
beautiful
daughter
whom
all
the
young
men
desired
in
marriage
also
had
fallen
in
love
with
her
but
he
felt
ashamed
to
declare
his
passion
because
of
his
poverty
the
maiden
had
already
repulsed
half
the
braves
of
his
tribe
why
he
argued
should
she
accept
him
poor
and
disfigured
as
he
was
one
day
he
passed
her
as
she
sat
outside
her
lodge
he
cast
a
penetrating
glance
at
her
a
glance
which
was
observed
by
one
of
her
unsuccessful
suitors
who
sneeringly
remarked
would
marry
our
chiefs
daughter
she
does
not
desire
a
man
without
a
blemish
ha
now
is
your
chance
turned
upon
the
jeerer
and
in
his
quiet
yet
dignified
manner
remarked
that
it
was
his
intention
to
ask
the
chief
daughter
to
be
his
wife
his
announcement
met
with
ridicule
but
he
took
no
notice
of
it
and
sought
the
girl
he
found
her
by
the
river
pulling
rushes
to
make
baskets
approaching
he
respectfully
addressed
her
i
am
poor
he
said
but
my
heart
is
rich
in
love
for
you
i
have
no
wealth
of
furs
or
pemmican
i
live
by
my
bow
and
spear
i
love
you
will
you
dwell
with
me
in
my
lodge
and
be
my
wife
the
decree
the
girl
regarded
him
with
bright
shy
eyes
peering
up
through
lashes
as
the
morning
sun
peers
through
the
branches
my
husband
would
not
be
poor
she
faltered
for
my
father
the
chief
is
wealthy
and
has
abundance
in
his
lodge
but
it
has
been
laid
upon
me
by
the
that
i
may
not
marry
these
are
heavy
words
said
sadly
may
they
not
be
recalled
on
one
condition
only
replied
the
girl
seek
the
and
ask
him
to
release
me
from
my
promise
if
he
consents
to
do
so
request
him
to
remove
the
scar
from
your
face
as
a
sign
that
i
may
know
that
he
gives
me
to
you
was
sad
at
heart
for
he
could
not
believe
that
the
having
chosen
such
a
beautiful
maiden
for
himself
would
renounce
her
but
he
gave
the
chief
daughter
his
promise
that
he
would
seek
out
the
god
in
his
own
bright
country
and
ask
him
to
grant
his
request
for
many
moons
sought
the
home
of
the
he
traversed
wide
plains
and
dense
forests
crossed
rivers
and
lofty
mountains
yet
never
a
trace
of
the
golden
gates
of
the
dwelling
of
the
god
of
light
could
he
see
many
inquiries
did
he
make
from
the
wild
denizens
of
the
forest
the
wolf
the
bear
the
badger
but
none
was
aware
of
the
way
to
the
home
of
the
he
asked
the
birds
but
though
they
flew
far
they
were
likewise
in
ignorance
of
the
road
thither
at
last
he
met
a
wolverine
who
told
him
that
he
had
been
there
himself
and
promised
to
set
him
on
the
way
for
a
long
and
weary
season
they
marched
onward
until
at
length
they
came
to
a
great
water
too
broad
and
too
deep
to
cross
as
sat
despondent
on
the
bank
bemoaning
his
case
two
beautiful
swans
advanced
from
the
water
and
requesting
him
to
sit
on
their
backs
bore
him
across
in
safety
landing
him
on
the
other
side
they
showed
him
which
way
to
take
and
left
him
he
had
not
walked
far
when
he
saw
a
bow
and
arrows
lying
before
him
but
was
punctilious
and
would
not
pick
them
up
because
they
did
not
belong
to
him
not
long
afterward
he
encountered
a
beautiful
youth
of
handsome
form
and
smiling
aspect
i
have
lost
a
bow
and
arrows
he
said
to
have
you
seen
them
told
him
that
he
had
seen
them
a
little
way
back
and
the
handsome
youth
praised
him
for
his
honesty
in
not
appropriating
them
he
further
asked
him
where
he
was
bound
for
i
am
seeking
the
sun
in
his
home
replied
the
indian
and
i
believe
that
i
am
not
far
from
my
destination
you
are
right
replied
the
youth
i
am
the
son
of
the
sun
apisirahts
the
morning
star
and
i
will
lead
you
to
the
presence
of
my
august
father
they
walked
onward
for
a
little
space
and
then
apisirahts
pointed
out
a
great
lodge
glorious
with
golden
light
and
decorated
with
an
art
more
curious
than
any
that
had
ever
beheld
at
the
entrance
stood
a
beautiful
woman
the
mother
of
morning
star
kokomikis
the
who
welcomed
the
footsore
indian
kindly
and
joyously
the
chase
of
the
savage
birds
then
the
great
appeared
wondrous
in
his
strength
and
beauty
as
the
mighty
planet
over
which
he
ruled
he
too
greeted
kindly
and
requested
him
to
be
his
guest
and
to
hunt
with
his
son
and
the
youth
gladly
set
out
for
the
chase
but
on
departing
the
warned
them
not
to
venture
near
the
great
water
as
there
dwelt
savage
birds
which
might
slay
morning
star
tarried
with
the
sun
his
wife
and
child
fearful
of
asking
his
boon
too
speedily
and
desiring
to
make
as
sure
as
possible
of
its
being
granted
one
day
he
and
morning
star
hunted
as
usual
and
the
youth
stole
away
for
he
wished
to
slay
the
savage
birds
of
which
his
father
had
spoken
but
followed
rescued
the
lad
in
imminent
peril
and
killed
the
monsters
the
sun
was
grateful
to
him
for
having
saved
his
son
from
a
terrible
death
and
asked
him
for
what
reason
he
had
sought
his
lodge
acquainted
him
with
the
circumstances
of
his
love
for
the
chief
daughter
and
of
his
quest
at
once
the
granted
his
desire

to
the
woman
you
love
so
much
he
said

and
make
her
yours
and
as
a
sign
that
it
is
my
will
that
she
should
be
your
wife
i
make
you
whole
with
a
motion
of
his
bright
hand
the
deity
removed
the
unsightly
scar
on
quitting
the
the
god
his
wife
and
son
presented
with
many
good
gifts
and
showed
him
a
short
route
by
which
to
return
to
once
more
soon
reached
his
home
when
he
sought
his
chief
daughter
she
did
not
know
him
at
first
so
rich
was
the
gleaming
attire
he
had
obtained
in
the
but
when
she
at
last
recognized
him
she
fell
upon
his
breast
with
a
glad
cry
that
same
day
she
was
made
his
wife
the
happy
pair
raised
a
lodge
to
the
and
henceforth
was
called
the
legend
of
poïa
a
variant
of
this
beautiful
story
is
as
follows
one
summer
morning
a
beautiful
girl
called
who
had
been
sleeping
outside
her
lodge
among
the
long
prairie
grass
awoke
just
as
the
morning
star
was
rising
above
the
horizon
she
gazed
intently
at
it
and
so
beautiful
did
it
seem
that
she
fell
deeply
in
love
with
it
she
awakened
her
sister
who
was
lying
beside
her
and
declared
to
her
that
she
would
marry
nobody
but
the
morning
star
the
people
of
her
tribe
ridiculed
her
because
of
what
they
considered
her
absurd
preference
so
she
avoided
them
as
much
as
possible
and
wandered
alone
eating
her
heart
out
in
secret
for
love
of
the
morning
star
who
seemed
to
her
unapproachable
one
day
she
went
alone
to
the
river
for
water
and
as
she
returned
she
beheld
a
young
man
standing
before
her
at
first
she
took
him
for
one
of
the
young
men
of
the
tribe
and
would
have
avoided
him
but
he
said
i
am
the
morning
star
i
beheld
you
gazing
upward
at
me
and
knew
that
you
loved
me
i
returned
your
love
and
have
descended
to
ask
you
to
go
with
me
to
my
dwelling
in
the
sky
trembled
violently
for
she
knew
that
he
who
spoke
to
her
was
a
god
and
replied
hesitatingly
that
she
must
bid
farewell
to
her
father
and
mother
but
this
morning
star
would
not
permit
he
took
a
rich
yellow
plume
from
his
hair
and
directed
her
to
hold
this
in
one
hand
while
she
held
a
juniper
branch
in
the
other
then
he
commanded
her
to
close
her
eyes
and
when
she
opened
them
again
she
was
in
the
standing
before
a
great
and
shining
lodge
morning
star
told
her
that
this
was
the
home
of
his
parents
the
sun
and
moon
and
requested
her
to
enter
it
was
daytime
so
that
the
sun
was
away
on
his
diurnal
round
but
the
moon
was
at
home
she
welcomed
as
the
wife
of
her
son
as
did
the
sun
himself
when
he
returned
the
moon
clothed
her
in
a
soft
robe
of
buckskin
trimmed
with
elks
teeth
was
very
happy
and
dwelt
contentedly
in
the
lodge
or
morning
star
they
had
a
little
son
whom
they
called
the
moon
gave
a
and
told
her
that
she
could
dig
up
all
kinds
of
roots
but
warned
her
on
no
account
to
dig
up
the
large
turnip
which
grew
near
the
home
of
the
spider
man
telling
her
that
it
would
bring
unhappiness
to
all
of
them
if
she
did
so
the
great
turnip
often
saw
the
large
turnip
but
always
avoided
touching
it
one
day
however
her
curiosity
got
the
better
of
her
and
she
was
tempted
to
see
what
might
be
underneath
it
she
laid
her
little
son
on
the
ground
and
dug
until
her
stuck
fast
two
large
cranes
came
flying
overhead
she
begged
these
to
help
her
they
did
so
and
sang
a
magic
song
which
enabled
them
to
uproot
the
turnip
now
although
she
was
unaware
of
it
this
very
turnip
filled
up
the
hole
through
which
morning
star
had
brought
her
into
the
gazing
downward
she
saw
the
camp
of
the
blackfeet
where
she
had
lived
the
smoke
was
ascending
from
the
lodges
she
could
hear
the
song
of
the
women
as
they
went
about
their
work
the
sight
made
her
homesick
and
lonely
and
as
she
went
back
to
her
lodge
she
cried
softly
to
herself
when
she
arrived
morning
star
gazed
earnestly
at
her
and
said
with
a
sorrowful
expression
of
countenance
you
have
dug
up
the
sacred
turnip
illustration
gazing
downward
she
saw
the
camp
of
the
blackfeet
the
moon
and
sun
were
also
troubled
and
asked
her
the
meaning
of
her
sadness
and
when
she
had
told
them
they
said
that
as
she
had
disobeyed
their
injunction
she
must
return
to
earth
morning
star
took
her
to
the
spider
man
who
let
her
down
to
earth
by
a
web
and
the
people
beheld
her
coming
to
earth
like
a
falling
star
the
return
to
earth
she
was
welcomed
by
her
parents
and
returned
with
her
child
whom
she
had
brought
with
her
from
the
to
the
home
of
her
youth
but
happiness
never
came
back
to
her
she
mourned
ceaselessly
for
her
husband
and
one
morning
climbing
to
the
summit
of
a
high
mound
she
watched
the
beautiful
morning
star
rise
above
the
horizon
just
as
on
the
day
when
she
had
first
loved
him
stretching
out
her
arms
to
the
eastern
sky
she
besought
him
passionately
to
take
her
back
at
length
he
spoke
to
her
it
is
because
of
your
own
sin
he
said
that
you
are
for
ever
shut
out
from
the
your
disobedience
has
brought
sorrow
upon
yourself
and
upon
all
your
people
her
pleadings
were
in
vain
and
in
despair
she
returned
to
her
lodge
where
her
unhappy
life
soon
came
to
a
close
her
little
son
was
now
an
orphan
and
the
death
of
his
grandparents
deprived
him
of
all
his
earthly
kindred
he
was
a
shy
retiring
timid
boy
living
in
the
deepest
poverty
notwithstanding
his
exalted
station
as
grandchild
of
the
sun
but
the
most
noticeable
thing
about
him
was
a
scar
which
disfigured
his
face
because
of
which
he
was
given
the
name
of
poïa
by
the
wits
of
the
tribe
as
he
grew
older
the
scar
became
more
pronounced
and
ridicule
and
abuse
were
heaped
upon
him
when
he
became
a
man
he
fell
in
love
with
a
maiden
of
surpassing
beauty
the
daughter
of
a
great
chief
of
his
tribe
she
however
laughed
him
to
scorn
and
told
him
that
she
would
marry
him
when
he
removed
the
scar
from
his
face
poïa
greatly
saddened
by
her
unkindness
consulted
an
old
to
see
whether
the
scar
might
not
be
removed
she
could
only
tell
him
that
the
mark
had
been
placed
on
his
face
by
the
sun
and
that
the
sun
alone
could
remove
it
this
was
melancholy
news
for
poïa
how
could
he
reach
the
abode
of
the
sun
nevertheless
encouraged
by
the
old
woman
he
resolved
to
make
the
attempt
gratefully
accepting
her
parting
gift
of
pemmican
and
moccasins
he
set
off
on
a
journey
that
was
to
last
for
many
days
the
big
water
after
climbing
mountains
and
traversing
forests
and
wandering
over
trackless
prairies
he
arrived
at
the
big
water
that
is
to
say
the
pacific
ocean
on
the
shores
of
which
he
sat
down
praying
and
fasting
for
three
days
on
the
third
day
when
the
sun
was
sinking
behind
the
rim
of
the
ocean
he
saw
a
bright
pathway
leading
straight
to
the
abode
of
the
sun
he
resolved
to
follow
the
shining
trail
though
he
knew
not
what
might
lie
before
him
in
the
great
he
arrived
quite
safely
however
at
the
wonderful
lodge
of
the
sun
all
night
he
hid
himself
outside
the
lodge
and
in
the
morning
the
sun
who
was
about
to
begin
his
daily
journey
saw
a
ragged
wayfarer
lying
by
his
door
he
did
not
know
that
the
intruder
was
his
grandson
but
seeing
that
he
had
come
from
the
he
determined
to
kill
him
and
said
so
to
his
wife
the
moon
but
she
begged
that
the
stranger
life
should
be
spared
and
morning
star
who
at
that
moment
issued
from
the
lodge
also
gave
poïa
his
protection
poïa
lived
very
happily
in
the
lodge
of
the
sun
and
having
on
one
occasion
killed
seven
birds
who
were
about
to
destroy
morning
star
he
earned
the
gratitude
of
his
grandparents
at
the
request
of
morning
star
the
sun
removed
the
scar
on
poïa
face
and
bade
him
return
with
a
message
to
the
blackfeet
if
they
would
honour
him
once
a
year
in
a
sun
dance
he
would
consent
to
heal
their
sick
the
secrets
of
the
sun
dance
were
taught
to
poïa
two
raven
feathers
were
placed
in
his
hair
and
he
was
given
a
robe
of
the
latter
he
was
told
must
only
be
worn
by
a
virtuous
woman
who
should
then
dance
the
sun
dance
so
that
the
sick
might
be
restored
to
health
from
his
father
poïa
received
an
enchanted
flute
and
a
magic
song
which
would
win
the
heart
of
the
maid
he
loved
poïa
came
to
earth
by
the
milky
way
or
as
the
indians
call
it
the
and
communicated
to
the
blackfeet
all
that
he
had
learned
in
the
when
they
were
thoroughly
conversant
with
the
sun
dance
he
returned
to
the
the
home
of
his
father
accompanied
by
his
beautiful
bride
here
they
dwelt
together
happily
and
pola
and
the
morning
star
travelled
together
through
the
sky
a
blackfoot
myth
many
stories
are
told
by
the
blackfoot
indians
of
their
creator
nápi
and
these
chiefly
relate
to
the
manner
in
which
he
made
the
world
and
its
inhabitants
one
myth
connected
with
this
deity
tells
how
a
poor
indian
who
had
a
wife
and
two
children
lived
in
the
greatest
indigence
on
roots
and
berries
this
man
had
a
dream
in
which
he
heard
a
voice
command
him
to
procure
a
large
which
he
was
to
hang
on
the
trail
of
the
animals
where
they
passed
through
the
forest
by
which
means
he
would
obtain
plenty
of
food
this
he
did
and
on
returning
to
the
place
in
which
he
had
hung
the
web
he
found
deer
and
rabbits
entangled
in
its
magical
meshes
these
he
killed
for
food
for
which
he
was
now
never
at
a
loss
returning
with
his
game
on
his
shoulders
one
morning
he
discovered
his
wife
perfuming
herself
with
sweet
pine
which
she
burned
over
the
fire
he
suspected
that
she
was
thus
making
herself
attractive
for
the
benefit
of
some
one
else
but
preserving
silence
he
told
her
that
on
the
following
day
he
would
set
his
at
a
greater
distance
as
the
game
in
the
neighbouring
forest
was
beginning
to
know
the
trap
too
well
accordingly
he
went
farther
afield
and
caught
a
deer
which
he
cut
up
carrying
part
of
its
meat
back
with
him
to
his
lodge
he
told
his
wife
where
the
remainder
of
the
carcass
was
to
be
found
and
asked
her
to
go
and
fetch
it
his
wife
however
was
not
without
her
own
suspicions
and
concluding
that
she
was
being
watched
by
her
husband
she
halted
at
the
top
of
the
nearest
hill
and
looked
back
to
see
if
he
was
following
her
but
he
was
sitting
where
she
had
left
him
so
she
proceeded
on
her
way
when
she
was
quite
out
of
sight
the
indian
himself
climbed
the
hill
and
seeing
that
she
was
not
in
the
vicinity
returned
to
the
camp
he
inquired
of
his
children
where
their
mother
went
to
gather
firewood
and
they
pointed
to
a
large
patch
of
dead
timber
proceeding
to
the
clump
of
leafless
trees
the
man
instituted
a
thorough
search
and
after
a
while
discovered
a
den
of
rattlesnakes
now
it
was
one
of
these
reptiles
with
which
his
wife
was
in
love
so
the
indian
in
his
wrath
gathered
fragments
of
dry
wood
and
set
the
whole
plantation
in
a
blaze
then
he
returned
to
his
lodge
and
told
his
children
what
he
had
done
at
the
same
time
warning
them
that
their
mother
would
be
very
wrathful
and
would
probably
attempt
to
kill
them
all
he
further
said
that
he
would
wait
for
her
return
but
that
they
had
better
run
away
and
that
he
would
provide
them
with
three
things
which
they
would
find
of
use
he
then
handed
to
the
children
a
stick
a
stone
and
a
bunch
of
moss
which
they
were
to
throw
behind
them
should
their
mother
pursue
them
the
children
at
once
ran
away
and
their
father
hung
the
over
the
door
of
the
lodge
meanwhile
the
woman
had
seen
the
blaze
made
by
the
dry
from
a
considerable
distance
and
in
great
anger
turned
and
ran
back
to
the
lodge
attempting
to
enter
it
she
was
at
once
entangled
in
the
meshes
of
the
the
pursuing
head
she
struggled
violently
however
and
succeeded
in
getting
her
head
through
the
opening
whereupon
her
husband
severed
it
from
her
shoulders
with
his
stone
axe
he
then
ran
out
of
the
lodge
and
down
the
valley
hotly
pursued
by
the
woman
body
while
her
head
rolled
along
the
ground
in
chase
of
the
children
the
latter
soon
descried
the
grisly
object
rolling
along
in
their
tracks
at
a
great
speed
and
one
of
them
quickly
threw
the
stick
behind
him
as
he
had
been
told
to
do
instantly
a
dense
forest
sprang
up
in
their
rear
which
for
a
space
retarded
their
horrible
pursuer
the
children
made
considerable
headway
but
once
more
the
severed
head
made
its
appearance
gnashing
its
teeth
in
a
frenzy
of
rage
and
rolling
its
eyes
horribly
while
it
shrieked
out
threats
which
caused
the
blood
to
turn
to
water
illustration
the
pursuing
head
then
another
of
the
boys
threw
the
stone
which
he
had
been
given
behind
him
and
instantly
a
great
mountain
sprang
up
which
occupied
the
land
from
sea
to
sea
so
that
the
progress
of
the
head
was
quite
barred
it
could
perceive
no
means
of
overcoming
this
immense
barrier
until
it
encountered
two
rams
feeding
which
it
asked
to
make
a
way
for
it
through
the
mountain
telling
them
that
if
they
would
do
so
it
would
marry
the
chief
of
the
sheep
the
rams
made
a
valiant
effort
to
meet
this
request
and
again
and
again
fiercely
rushed
at
the
mountain
till
their
horns
were
split
and
broken
and
they
could
butt
no
longer
the
head
growing
impatient
called
upon
a
colony
of
ants
which
dwelt
in
the
neighbourhood
to
tunnel
a
passage
through
the
obstacle
and
offered
if
they
were
successful
to
marry
the
chief
ant
as
a
recompense
for
their
labours
the
insects
at
once
took
up
the
task
and
toiled
incessantly
until
they
had
made
a
tunnel
through
which
the
head
could
roll
the
fate
of
the
head
the
children
were
still
running
but
felt
that
the
head
had
not
abandoned
pursuit
at
last
after
a
long
interval
they
observed
it
rolling
after
them
evidently
as
fresh
as
ever
the
child
who
had
the
bunch
of
moss
now
wet
it
and
wrung
out
the
water
over
their
trail
and
immediately
an
immense
strait
separated
them
from
the
land
where
they
had
been
but
a
moment
before
the
head
unable
to
stop
fell
into
this
great
water
and
was
drowned
the
children
seeing
that
their
danger
was
past
made
a
raft
and
sailed
back
to
the
land
from
which
they
had
come
arrived
there
they
journeyed
eastward
through
many
countries
peopled
by
many
different
tribes
of
indians
in
order
to
reach
their
own
territory
when
they
arrived
there
they
found
it
occupied
by
tribes
unknown
to
them
so
they
resolved
to
separate
one
going
north
and
the
other
south
one
of
them
was
shrewd
and
clever
and
the
other
simple
and
ingenious
the
shrewd
boy
is
he
who
made
the
white
people
and
instructed
them
in
their
arts
the
other
the
simple
boy
made
the
blackfeet
but
being
very
stupid
was
unable
to
teach
them
anything
he
it
was
who
was
called
nápi
as
for
the
mother
body
it
continued
to
chase
her
husband
and
is
still
following
him
for
she
is
the
moon
and
he
is
the
sun
if
she
succeeds
in
catching
him
she
will
slay
him
and
night
will
reign
for
evermore
but
as
long
as
he
is
able
to
evade
her
day
and
night
will
continue
to
follow
one
another
nápi
and
the
there
was
once
a
great
famine
among
the
blackfeet
for
months
no
buffaloes
were
killed
and
the
weaker
members
of
the
tribe
dropped
off
one
by
one
while
even
the
strong
braves
and
hunters
began
to
sink
under
the
privation
the
chief
in
despair
prayed
that
the
creator
nápi
would
send
them
food
nápi
meanwhile
was
far
away
in
the
south
painting
the
plumage
of
the
birds
in
gorgeous
tints
nevertheless
he
heard
the
voice
of
the
chief
over
all
the
distance
and
hastened
northward
who
has
summoned
me
he
demanded
it
was
i
said
the
chief
humbly
my
people
are
starving
and
unless
relief
comes
soon
i
fear
we
must
all
perish
you
shall
have
food
answered
nápi
i
will
provide
game
for
you
taking
with
him
the
chief
son
nápi
travelled
toward
the
west
as
they
went
the
youth
prayed
earnestly
to
the
sun
the
moon
and
the
morning
star
but
his
companion
rebuked
his
impatience
and
bade
him
hold
his
peace
they
crossed
the
sweet
grass
hills
which
nápi
had
made
from
huge
handfuls
of
herbage
and
where
he
loved
to
rest
still
there
was
no
sign
of
game
at
length
they
reached
a
little
lodge
by
the
side
of
a
river
and
nápi
called
a
halt
there
dwells
the
cause
of
your
misfortunes
said
he
he
who
lives
in
that
lodge
is
the
he
it
is
who
has
taken
all
the
herds
from
the
prairies
so
that
there
is
none
left
to
further
his
design
nápi
took
the
shape
of
a
dog
and
turned
the
youth
into
a
stick
not
long
afterward
the
little
son
of
was
passing
that
way
and
immediately
desired
to
take
the
little
dog
home
with
him
very
well
said
his
mother
take
that
stick
and
drive
it
to
the
lodge
but
the
boy
father
frowned
angrily
i
do
not
like
the
look
of
the
beast
he
said
send
it
away
the
boy
refused
to
part
with
the
dog
and
his
mother
wanted
the
stick
to
gather
roots
with
so
the
father
was
obliged
to
give
way
still
he
did
not
show
any
to
the
dog
the
following
day
he
went
out
of
the
lodge
and
in
a
short
time
returned
with
a
buffalo
which
he
skinned
and
prepared
for
cooking
his
wife
who
was
in
the
woods
gathering
berries
came
home
toward
evening
and
at
her
bidding
cooked
part
of
the
the
little
boy
incurred
his
father
anger
again
by
giving
a
piece
of
meat
to
the
dog
have
i
not
told
you
cried
irately
that
he
is
an
evil
thing
do
not
touch
him
that
night
when
all
was
silent
nápi
and
the
chief
son
resumed
their
human
form
and
supped
off
the
it
is
who
keeps
the
herds
from
coming
near
the
blackfoot
camp
said
nápi
wait
till
morning
and
see
the
herds
of
in
the
morning
they
were
once
more
dog
and
stick
when
the
woman
and
her
child
awoke
they
set
off
for
the
woods
again
the
former
taking
the
stick
to
dig
for
roots
the
latter
calling
for
his
little
dog
to
accompany
him
alas
when
they
reached
the
spot
they
had
fixed
upon
for
operations
both
dog
and
stick
had
vanished
and
this
was
the
reason
for
their
disappearance
as
the
dog
was
trotting
through
the
wood
he
had
observed
an
opening
like
the
mouth
of
a
cavern
all
but
concealed
by
the
thick
undergrowth
and
in
the
aperture
he
perceived
a
buffalo
his
short
sharp
barking
attracted
the
attention
of
the
stick
which
promptly
wriggled
after
him
within
the
cavern
were
great
herds
of
deer
and
buffalo
enough
to
provide
the
blackfeet
with
food
for
years
and
years
nápi
ran
among
them
barking
and
they
were
driven
out
to
the
prairie
when
returned
and
discovered
his
loss
his
wrath
knew
no
bounds
he
questioned
his
wife
and
son
but
they
denied
all
knowledge
of
the
affair
then
said
he
it
is
that
wretched
little
dog
of
yours
where
is
he
now
but
the
child
could
not
tell
him
we
lost
him
in
the
woods
said
he
i
shall
kill
him
shouted
the
man
and
i
shall
break
the
stick
as
well
nápi
overheard
the
threat
and
clung
to
the
long
hair
of
an
old
buffalo
he
advised
the
stick
to
conceal
itself
in
the
buffalo
hair
also
and
so
the
twain
escaped
unnoticed
from
the
cave
much
as
did
ulysses
from
the
cyclops
cavern
once
again
they
took
the
form
of
men
and
drove
a
herd
of
buffalo
to
the
blackfoot
camp
while
and
his
family
sought
them
in
vain
the
people
met
them
with
delighted
acclamations
and
the
famine
was
at
an
end
yet
there
were
still
some
difficulties
in
the
way
for
when
they
tried
to
get
the
herd
into
the
enclosure
a
large
grey
bird
so
frightened
the
animals
with
its
dismal
note
that
they
refused
to
enter
this
occurred
so
often
that
nápi
suspected
that
the
grey
bird
was
no
other
than
changing
himself
into
an
otter
he
lay
by
the
side
of
a
river
and
pretended
to
be
dead
the
greedy
bird
saw
what
he
thought
to
be
a
dead
otter
and
pounced
upon
it
whereupon
nápi
seized
him
by
the
leg
and
bore
him
off
to
the
camp
by
way
of
punishment
he
was
tied
over
the
of
the
wigwam
where
his
grey
feathers
soon
became
black
and
his
life
a
burden
to
him
spare
me
he
cried
let
me
return
to
my
wife
and
child
they
will
surely
starve
his
piteous
appeals
moved
the
heart
of
nápi
and
he
let
him
go
but
not
without
an
admonition
go
said
he
and
hunt
for
food
that
you
may
support
your
wife
and
child
but
do
not
take
more
than
you
need
or
you
shall
die
the
bird
did
as
he
was
bidden
but
to
this
day
the
feathers
of
the
raven
are
black
and
not
grey
the
story
of
kutoyis
there
once
lived
on
the
banks
of
the
missouri
an
old
couple
who
had
one
daughter
their
only
child
when
she
grew
to
be
a
woman
she
had
a
suitor
who
was
cruel
and
overbearing
but
as
she
loved
him
her
parents
offered
no
opposition
to
their
marriage
indeed
they
gave
the
bride
the
best
part
of
their
possessions
for
a
dowry
so
that
she
and
her
husband
were
rich
while
her
father
and
mother
lived
in
a
poor
lodge
and
had
very
little
to
eat
the
wicked
took
advantage
of
their
kindness
in
every
way
he
forced
the
old
man
to
accompany
him
on
his
hunting
expeditions
and
then
refused
to
share
the
game
with
him
sometimes
one
would
kill
a
buffalo
and
sometimes
the
other
but
always
it
was
the
younger
man
who
got
the
best
of
the
meat
and
who
made
himself
robes
and
moccasins
from
the
hide
thus
the
aged
couple
were
nearly
perishing
from
cold
and
hunger
only
when
her
husband
was
out
hunting
would
the
daughter
venture
to
carry
a
morsel
of
meat
to
her
parents
on
one
occasion
the
younger
man
called
in
his
overbearing
way
to
his
bidding
him
help
in
a
the
old
man
reduced
by
want
almost
to
a
skeleton
was
too
much
afraid
of
the
tyrant
to
venture
to
disobey
him
so
he
accompanied
him
in
the
chase
ere
long
they
encountered
a
fine
buffalo
whereupon
both
drew
their
bows
and
fired
but
it
was
the
arrow
of
the
elder
man
which
pierced
the
animal
and
brought
it
to
the
ground
the
old
man
set
himself
to
skin
the
buffalo
for
his
never
shared
in
these
tasks
but
left
them
to
his
companion
while
he
was
thus
engaged
the
latter
observed
a
drop
of
blood
on
one
of
his
arrows
which
had
fallen
to
the
ground
thinking
that
even
a
drop
of
blood
was
better
than
nothing
he
replaced
the
arrow
in
its
quiver
and
set
off
home
as
it
happened
no
more
of
the
buffalo
than
that
fell
to
his
share
the
rest
being
appropriated
by
his
on
his
return
the
old
man
called
to
his
wife
to
heap
fuel
on
the
fire
and
put
on
the
kettle
she
thinking
he
had
brought
home
some
hastened
to
do
his
bidding
she
waited
curiously
till
the
water
in
the
kettle
had
boiled
then
to
her
surprise
she
saw
him
place
in
it
an
arrow
with
a
drop
of
blood
on
it
how
kutoyis
was
born
why
do
you
do
that
she
asked
something
will
come
of
it
he
replied
my
spirit
tells
me
so
they
waited
in
silence
then
a
strange
sound
was
heard
in
their
lonely
little
lodge
the
crying
of
a
child
half
fearfully
half
curiously
the
old
couple
lifted
the
lid
of
the
kettle
and
there
within
was
a
little
baby
boy
he
shall
bring
us
good
luck
said
the
old
indian
they
called
the
child
kutoyis
that
is
of
blood
and
wrapped
him
up
as
is
customary
with
indian
babies
let
us
tell
our
said
the
old
man
that
it
is
a
little
girl
and
he
will
let
it
live
if
we
say
it
is
a
boy
he
will
surely
kill
it
kutoyis
became
a
great
favourite
in
the
little
lodge
to
which
he
had
come
he
was
always
laughing
and
his
merriment
won
the
hearts
of
the
old
people
one
day
while
they
thought
him
much
too
young
to
speak
they
were
astonished
to
hear
his
voice
lash
me
up
and
hang
me
from
the
lodge
pole
said
he
and
i
shall
become
a
man
when
they
had
recovered
from
their
astonishment
they
lashed
him
to
the
lodge
pole
in
a
moment
he
had
burst
the
lashings
and
grown
before
their
eyes
into
a
tall
strong
man
looking
round
the
lodge
which
seemed
scarcely
large
enough
to
hold
him
kutoyis
perceived
that
there
was
no
food
about
give
me
some
arrows
said
he
and
i
will
bring
you
food
we
have
no
arrows
replied
the
old
man
only
four
kutoyis
fetched
some
wood
from
which
he
cut
a
fine
bow
and
shafts
to
fit
the
flint
he
begged
the
old
indian
to
lead
him
to
a
good
and
when
he
had
done
so
they
quickly
killed
a
magnificent
buffalo
meanwhile
the
old
indian
had
told
kutoyis
how
badly
his
had
treated
him
and
as
they
were
skinning
the
buffalo
who
should
pass
by
but
the
subject
of
their
conversation
kutoyis
hid
behind
the
dead
animal
to
see
what
would
happen
and
a
moment
later
the
angry
voice
of
the
was
heard
getting
no
reply
the
cowardly
hunter
fitted
an
arrow
to
his
bow
and
shot
it
at
his
enraged
at
the
cruel
act
kutoyis
rose
from
his
behind
the
dead
buffalo
and
fired
all
his
arrows
at
the
young
man
whom
he
slew
he
afterward
gave
food
in
plenty
to
the
old
man
and
his
wife
and
bade
them
return
to
their
home
they
were
delighted
to
find
themselves
once
more
free
from
persecution
but
their
daughter
wept
so
much
that
finally
kutoyis
asked
her
whether
she
would
have
another
husband
or
whether
she
wished
to
follow
her
first
spouse
to
the
land
of
shadows
as
she
must
do
if
she
persisted
in
lamenting
him
the
lady
chose
the
former
alternative
as
the
lesser
evil
and
kutoyis
found
her
an
excellent
husband
with
whom
she
lived
happily
for
a
long
time
kutoyis
on
his
travels
at
length
kutoyis
tired
of
his
monotonous
life
and
desired
to
see
more
of
the
world
so
his
host
directed
him
to
a
distant
village
where
he
was
welcomed
by
two
old
women
they
set
before
their
handsome
guest
the
best
fare
at
their
disposal
which
was
of
a
rather
unattractive
appearance
is
there
no
good
meat
queried
kutoyis
the
old
women
explained
that
one
of
the
lodges
was
occupied
by
a
fierce
bear
who
seized
upon
all
the
good
meat
and
left
only
the
dry
poor
sort
for
his
neighbours
without
hesitation
kutoyis
went
out
and
killed
a
buffalo
calf
which
he
presented
to
the
women
desiring
them
to
place
the
best
parts
of
the
meat
in
a
prominent
position
outside
the
lodge
where
the
big
bear
could
not
fail
to
see
it
this
they
did
and
sure
enough
one
of
the
shortly
passed
by
and
seized
the
meat
kutoyis
who
had
been
lying
in
wait
rushed
out
and
hit
the
animal
as
hard
as
he
could
the
cub
carried
his
tale
of
woe
to
his
father
and
the
big
bear
growling
threats
of
vengeance
gathered
his
whole
family
round
him
and
rushed
to
the
lodge
of
the
old
women
intending
to
kill
the
bold
hunter
however
kutoyis
was
more
than
a
match
for
all
of
them
and
very
soon
the
bears
were
slain
still
he
was
unsatisfied
and
longed
for
further
adventures
tell
me
said
he
where
shall
i
find
another
village
the
wrestling
woman
there
is
a
village
by
the
big
river
said
the
old
women
but
you
must
not
go
there
for
a
wicked
woman
dwells
in
it
who
wrestles
with
and
slays
all
who
approach
no
sooner
did
kutoyis
hear
this
than
he
determined
to
seek
the
village
for
his
mission
was
to
destroy
evil
beings
who
were
a
danger
to
his
so
in
spite
of
the
dissuasions
of
the
old
women
he
departed
as
he
had
been
warned
the
woman
came
out
of
her
lodge
on
the
approach
of
the
stranger
and
invited
him
to
wrestle
with
her
i
can
not
said
he
pretending
to
be
frightened
the
woman
mocked
and
jeered
at
him
while
he
made
various
excuses
but
all
the
time
he
was
observing
how
the
land
lay
when
he
drew
nearer
he
saw
that
she
had
covered
the
ground
with
sharp
flints
over
which
she
had
strewn
grass
at
last
he
said
very
well
i
will
wrestle
with
you
it
was
no
wonder
that
she
had
killed
many
braves
for
she
was
very
strong
but
kutoyis
was
still
stronger
with
all
her
skill
she
could
not
throw
him
and
at
last
she
grew
tired
and
was
herself
thrown
on
the
sharp
flints
on
which
she
bled
to
death
the
people
rejoiced
greatly
when
they
heard
of
her
death
and
kutoyis
was
universally
acclaimed
as
a
hero
kutoyis
did
many
other
high
deeds
before
he
departed
to
the
shadowland
and
when
he
went
he
left
sorrow
in
many
lodges
chapter
iv
iroquois
myths
and
legends
iroquois
gods
and
heroes
the
myths
of
the
iroquois
are
of
exceptional
interest
because
of
the
portraits
they
present
of
several
heroes
the
earliest
substratum
of
the
myths
of
this
people
deals
with
the
adventures
of
their
principal
deity
the
who
with
his
brother
the
west
wind
finally
overcame
and
exterminated
the
powerful
race
of
stone
giants
coming
to
a
later
period
we
find
that
a
number
of
legends
cluster
round
the
names
of
the
chiefs
atotarho
and
hiawatha
who
in
all
probability
at
one
time
really
existed
these
present
a
good
instance
of
the
rapidity
with
which
myth
gathers
round
a
famous
name
atotarho
the
mighty
warrior
is
now
regarded
as
the
wizard
of
the
iroquois
but
probably
this
does
not
result
from
the
fact
that
he
was
cunning
and
cruel
as
some
writers
on
the
tribe
appear
to
think
but
from
the
circumstance
that
as
a
great
warrior
he
was
clothed
in
a
garment
of
serpents
and
these
reptiles
besides
being
looked
upon
as
powerful
also
possessed
a
deep
magical
significance
the
original
hiawatha
he
who
seeks
the
is
pictured
as
the
father
of
a
long
line
of
persons
of
the
same
name
who
appear
to
have
been
important
functionaries
in
the
tribal
government
to
him
was
ascribed
the
honour
of
having
established
the
great
confederacy
of
the
iroquois
which
so
long
rendered
them
formidable
opponents
to
the
tribes
which
surrounded
them
like
many
other
heroes
in
myth
the
celtic
mananan
for
example
hiawatha
possessed
a
magic
canoe
which
would
obey
his
slightest
behest
and
in
which
he
finally
quitted
the
terrestrial
sphere
for
that
shadowy
region
to
which
all
heroes
finally
take
their
departure
many
interesting
myths
are
related
of
the
manner
in
which
destroyed
the
monsters
and
giants
which
infested
the
early
world
a
hunter
caught
in
a
heavy
took
refuge
in
the
woods
crouching
under
the
shelter
of
a
great
tree
he
became
aware
of
a
mysterious
voice
which
urged
him
to
follow
it
he
was
conscious
of
a
sensation
of
slowly
rising
from
the
earth
and
he
soon
found
himself
gazing
downward
from
a
point
near
the
clouds
the
height
of
many
trees
from
the
ground
he
was
surrounded
by
beings
who
had
all
the
appearance
of
men
with
one
among
them
who
seemed
to
be
their
chief
they
asked
him
to
cast
his
eyes
toward
the
earth
and
tell
them
whether
he
could
see
a
huge
unable
to
descry
such
a
monster
the
chief
anointed
his
eyes
with
a
sacred
ointment
which
gave
him
supernatural
sight
and
permitted
him
to
behold
a
shape
in
the
watery
depths
far
below
him
the
chief
commanded
one
of
his
warriors
to
dispatch
the
monster
but
arrow
after
arrow
failed
to
transfix
it
whereupon
the
hunter
was
requested
to
display
his
skill
as
an
archer
drawing
his
bow
he
took
careful
aim
the
arrow
whizzed
down
the
depths
and
was
speedily
lost
to
sight
but
a
terrible
commotion
arose
in
the
lake
below
the
body
of
the
great
serpent
leaping
from
the
water
with
dreadful
writhings
and
contortions
so
appalling
was
the
din
that
rose
up
to
them
that
even
the
heavenly
beings
by
whom
the
hunter
was
surrounded
fell
into
a
great
trembling
but
gradually
the
tempest
of
sound
subsided
and
the
huge
bulk
of
the
mortally
wounded
serpent
sank
back
into
the
lake
the
surface
of
which
became
gradually
more
still
until
finally
all
was
peace
once
more
the
chief
thanked
the
hunter
for
the
service
he
had
rendered
and
he
was
conducted
back
to
earth
thus
was
man
first
brought
into
contact
with
the
beneficent
and
thus
did
he
learn
the
existence
of
a
power
which
would
protect
him
from
forces
unfriendly
to
humanity
the
thunderers
once
in
early
iroquois
days
three
braves
set
out
upon
an
expedition
after
they
had
journeyed
for
some
time
a
misfortune
occurred
one
of
their
number
breaking
his
leg
the
others
fashioned
a
litter
with
the
object
of
carrying
him
back
to
his
home
as
indian
custom
exacted
retracing
their
steps
they
came
to
a
range
of
high
mountains
the
steep
slopes
of
which
taxed
their
strength
to
the
utmost
to
rest
themselves
they
placed
the
disabled
man
on
the
ground
and
withdrew
to
a
little
distance
why
should
we
be
thus
burdened
with
a
wounded
man
said
one
to
the
other
you
speak
truly
was
the
rejoinder
why
should
we
indeed
since
his
hurt
has
come
upon
him
by
reason
of
his
own
carelessness
as
they
spoke
their
eyes
met
in
a
meaning
glance
and
one
of
them
pointed
to
a
deep
hole
or
pit
opening
in
the
side
of
the
mountain
at
a
little
distance
from
the
place
where
they
were
sitting
returning
to
the
injured
man
they
raised
him
as
if
about
to
proceed
on
the
journey
and
when
passing
the
brink
of
the
pit
suddenly
hurled
him
into
it
with
great
force
then
without
loss
of
time
they
set
their
faces
homeward
when
they
arrived
in
camp
they
reported
that
their
comrade
had
died
of
wounds
received
in
fight
but
that
he
had
not
fallen
into
the
enemy
hands
having
received
careful
attention
from
them
in
his
dying
moments
and
honourable
burial
the
unfortunate
man
aged
mother
was
prostrate
with
grief
at
the
sad
news
but
was
somewhat
relieved
to
think
that
her
son
had
been
kindly
ministered
to
at
the
end
illustration
he
suddenly
assumed
the
shape
of
a
gigantic
porcupine
when
the
brave
who
had
been
thrown
into
the
pit
regained
his
senses
after
the
severe
fall
he
had
sustained
he
perceived
a
man
of
venerable
aspect
bending
over
him
solicitously
when
this
person
saw
that
the
young
man
had
regained
consciousness
he
asked
him
what
had
been
the
intention
of
his
comrades
in
so
cruelly
casting
him
into
that
abyss
the
young
man
replied
that
his
fellows
had
become
tired
of
carrying
him
and
had
thus
rid
themselves
of
him
the
old
hermit
for
so
he
seemed
to
be
made
a
hasty
examination
of
the
indian
injuries
and
announced
that
he
would
speedily
cure
him
on
one
condition
the
other
pledged
his
word
to
accept
this
whatever
it
might
be
whereupon
the
recluse
told
him
that
all
he
required
was
that
he
should
hunt
for
him
and
bring
home
to
him
such
game
as
he
should
slay
to
this
the
brave
gave
a
ready
assent
the
old
man
lost
no
time
in
performing
his
part
of
the
bargain
he
applied
herbs
to
his
injuries
and
assiduously
tended
his
guest
who
made
a
speedy
and
satisfactory
recovery
the
grateful
warrior
once
more
enabled
to
follow
the
chase
brought
home
many
trophies
of
his
skill
as
a
hunter
to
the
cave
on
the
and
soon
the
pair
had
formed
a
strong
attachment
one
day
when
in
the
forest
the
warrior
encountered
an
enormous
bear
which
he
succeeded
in
slaying
after
a
desperate
struggle
as
he
was
pondering
how
best
he
could
remove
it
to
the
cave
he
became
aware
of
a
murmur
of
voices
behind
him
and
glancing
round
he
saw
three
men
or
beings
in
the
shape
of
men
clad
in
strange
diaphanous
garments
standing
near
in
reply
to
his
question
as
to
what
brought
them
there
they
told
him
that
they
were
the
thunderers
or
people
of
whose
mission
it
was
to
keep
the
earth
in
good
order
for
the
benefit
of
humanity
and
to
slay
or
destroy
every
agency
inimical
to
mankind
they
told
him
that
the
old
man
with
whom
he
had
been
residing
was
by
no
means
the
sort
of
person
he
seemed
to
think
and
that
they
had
come
to
earth
with
the
express
intention
of
compassing
his
destruction
in
this
they
requested
his
assistance
and
promised
him
that
if
he
would
vouchsafe
it
he
would
speedily
be
transported
back
to
his
lodge
overjoyed
at
this
proposal
the
hunter
did
not
scruple
to
return
to
the
cave
and
tell
the
hermit
that
he
had
killed
the
bear
which
he
wished
his
help
in
bringing
home
the
old
man
seemed
very
uneasy
and
begged
him
to
examine
the
sky
and
tell
him
whether
he
perceived
the
least
sign
of
clouds
the
young
brave
reassured
him
and
told
him
that
not
a
cloud
was
to
be
seen
whereupon
emerging
from
his
shelter
he
made
for
the
spot
where
the
bear
was
lying
hastily
picking
up
the
carcass
he
requested
his
companion
to
place
it
all
on
his
shoulders
which
the
young
man
did
expressing
surprise
at
his
great
strength
he
had
proceeded
with
his
burden
for
some
distance
when
a
terrific
clap
of
thunder
burst
from
the
menacing
black
clouds
which
had
speedily
gathered
overhead
in
great
terror
the
old
man
threw
down
his
load
and
commenced
to
run
with
an
agility
which
belied
his
years
but
when
a
second
peal
broke
forth
he
suddenly
assumed
the
shape
of
a
gigantic
porcupine
which
dashed
through
the
undergrowth
discharging
its
quills
like
arrows
as
it
ran
a
veritable
hail
of
thunderbolts
now
crashed
down
upon
the
spiny
back
as
it
reached
the
entrance
to
the
cave
one
larger
than
the
rest
struck
it
with
such
tremendous
force
that
it
rolled
dead
into
its
den
then
the
thunderers
swooped
down
from
the
sky
in
triumph
mightily
pleased
at
the
death
of
their
victim
the
young
hunter
now
requested
them
to
discharge
the
promise
they
had
made
him
to
transport
him
back
to
his
mother
lodge
so
having
fastened
on
his
shoulders
they
speedily
brought
him
thither
carrying
him
carefully
through
the
air
and
depositing
him
just
outside
the
hut
the
widow
was
delighted
to
see
her
son
whom
she
had
believed
to
be
long
dead
and
the
thunderers
were
so
pleased
with
the
assistance
he
had
lent
them
that
they
asked
him
to
accompany
them
in
their
mission
every
spring
he
assented
and
on
one
of
these
expeditions
flew
earthward
to
drink
from
a
certain
pool
when
he
rejoined
his
companions
they
observed
that
the
water
with
which
his
lips
were
moist
had
caused
them
to
shine
as
if
smeared
with
oil
at
their
request
he
indicated
the
pool
from
which
he
had
drunk
and
they
informed
him
that
in
its
depths
there
dwelt
a
monster
for
which
they
had
searched
for
years
with
that
they
hurled
a
great
thunderbolt
into
the
pool
which
immediately
dried
up
revealing
an
immense
grub
of
the
species
which
destroys
the
standing
crops
the
monster
was
indeed
the
king
of
grubs
and
his
death
set
back
the
conspiracies
of
his
kind
for
many
generations
the
youth
subsequently
returned
to
earth
and
having
narrated
to
the
members
of
his
tribe
the
services
which
had
performed
on
their
behalf
they
considered
it
fitting
to
institute
a
special
worship
of
the
deity
and
in
fact
to
make
him
supreme
god
of
their
nation
even
many
iroquois
allude
to
as
their
grandfather
and
evince
extraordinary
veneration
at
the
mention
of
his
name
hiawatha
much
confusion
exists
with
regard
to
the
true
status
of
the
reputed
iroquois
hero
hiawatha
we
find
him
variously
represented
as
a
historical
personage
and
a
mythical
and
as
belonging
to
both
the
iroquois
and
the
algonquins
in
solid
history
and
in
the
wildest
myth
he
is
a
figure
of
equal
importance
this
confusion
is
largely
due
to
the
popularity
of
longfellow
poem
which
by
its
very
excellence
has
given
the
greater
prominence
to
the
fallacies
it
contains
the
fact
is
that
longfellow
following
in
the
path
of
schoolcraft
has
really
confused
two
personages
in
the
character
of
hiawatha
one
the
entirely
mythical
manabozho
or
michabo
which
name
he
at
first
intended
to
bestow
on
his
poem
and
the
other
the
almost
wholly
historical
hiawatha
manabozho
according
to
tradition
was
a
of
the
ojibways
and
to
him
and
not
to
hiawatha
must
be
credited
the
exploits
described
in
the
poem
there
is
no
doubt
that
myths
have
grown
up
round
the
name
of
the
iroquois
hero
for
myth
is
the
ivy
that
binds
all
historical
ruins
and
makes
them
picturesque
to
the
eye
but
it
has
been
proved
that
there
is
a
solid
structure
of
fact
behind
the
legendary
stories
of
hiawatha
and
even
the
period
of
his
activity
has
been
fixed
with
tolerable
accuracy
by
modern
american
historians
hiawatha
or
was
a
chief
of
iroquois
stock
belonging
either
to
the
onondaga
or
the
mohawk
tribe
his
most
important
feat
was
the
union
of
the
five
nations
of
the
iroquois
into
a
grand
league
an
event
which
was
of
more
than
national
significance
since
it
so
largely
affected
the
fortunes
of
european
peoples
when
they
afterward
fought
for
american
supremacy
as
the
five
nations
are
known
to
have
come
together
in
the
sixteenth
century
it
follows
that
hiawatha
must
have
lived
and
worked
about
that
time
in
later
days
the
league
was
called
the
six
nations
and
still
more
recently
the
seven
nations
when
the
iroquois
or
house
people
were
found
by
the
french
and
dutch
they
occupied
the
western
part
of
what
is
now
new
york
state
and
were
at
a
much
more
advanced
stage
of
culture
than
most
of
the
indian
tribes
they
tilled
the
ground
cultivating
maize
and
tobacco
and
were
skilled
in
the
arts
of
war
and
diplomacy
they
were
greatly
strengthened
by
the
grand
league
or
kowa
which
as
has
been
said
was
founded
by
the
chief
hiawatha
and
were
much
the
most
important
of
the
north
american
tribes
if
we
look
to
tradition
for
an
account
of
the
origin
of
the
grand
league
we
learn
that
the
union
was
effected
by
hiawatha
in
the
fourteenth
century
the
hurons
and
iroquois
we
are
told
were
at
one
time
one
people
but
later
they
separated
the
hurons
going
to
the
lake
which
is
named
after
them
and
the
iroquois
to
new
york
where
their
five
tribes
were
united
under
a
general
council
but
tradition
is
quite
evidently
wrong
in
assigning
so
early
a
date
to
this
important
event
for
one
of
the
two
branches
of
the
iroquois
family
that
which
comprises
the
mohawks
and
the
oneidas
has
left
but
few
traces
of
an
early
occupation
and
these
in
the
shape
of
some
old
are
judged
to
belong
to
the
latter
part
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
early
connexion
between
the
iroquois
and
the
hurons
and
their
subsequent
separation
remains
undisputed
the
iroquois
family
was
divided
into
two
branches
the
sinnekes
onondagas
cayugas
and
senecas
and
the
caniengas
mohawks
and
oneidas
of
which
the
subdivisions
composed
the
five
nations
the
sinnekes
had
established
themselves
in
the
western
portion
of
new
york
and
the
caniengas
at
hochelaga
montreal
and
elsewhere
on
the
lawrence
where
they
lived
amicably
enough
with
their
algonquin
neighbours
but
in
a
quarrel
arose
between
the
caniengas
and
the
algonquins
in
which
the
latter
called
in
the
aid
of
the
hurons
this
was
the
beginning
of
a
long
war
in
which
the
caniengas
had
the
worst
of
it
gradually
the
caniengas
were
driven
along
the
shores
of
lake
champlain
and
lake
george
till
they
reached
the
valley
of
the
mohawk
river
where
they
established
themselves
in
a
country
bordering
on
that
of
the
onondagas
now
the
onondagas
were
a
formidable
tribe
fierce
and
warlike
and
the
caniengas
being
long
accustomed
to
war
were
not
the
most
peaceable
of
nations
and
ere
long
there
was
trouble
between
them
while
both
were
at
war
with
the
hurons
at
the
head
of
the
onondagas
was
the
great
chief
atotarho
whose
sanguinary
exploits
and
crafty
stratagems
had
become
the
dread
of
the
neighbouring
peoples
and
among
his
warriors
was
the
generous
hiawatha
hiawatha
was
filled
with
horror
at
the
sight
of
the
suffering
caused
by
atotarho
expeditions
and
already
his
mind
was
forming
projects
of
peace
he
saw
that
in
confederation
lay
the
means
not
only
of
preserving
peace
among
his
people
but
of
withstanding
alien
foes
as
well
in
two
consecutive
years
he
called
an
assembly
to
consider
his
plan
but
on
each
occasion
the
grim
presence
of
atotarho
made
discussion
impossible
hiawatha
in
despair
fled
from
the
land
of
the
onondagas
journeyed
eastward
through
the
country
of
the
oneidas
and
at
last
took
up
his
residence
among
the
mohawks
into
which
tribe
he
was
adopted
it
has
been
said
by
some
authorities
and
the
idea
does
not
lack
probability
that
hiawatha
was
originally
a
mohawk
and
that
he
spent
some
time
among
the
onondagas
afterward
returning
to
his
own
people
at
all
events
the
mohawks
proved
more
amenable
to
reason
than
the
onondagas
had
done
among
the
chiefs
of
his
adopted
tribe
hiawatha
found
one
dekanewidah
who
fell
in
with
his
confederation
plans
and
agreed
to
work
along
with
him
messengers
were
dispatched
to
the
oneidas
who
bade
them
return
in
a
year
at
the
end
of
which
period
negotiations
were
renewed
the
result
was
that
the
oneida
chiefs
signed
a
treaty
inaugurating
the
kayanerenh
kowa
an
embassy
to
the
onondagas
was
fruitless
as
atotarho
persistently
obstructed
the
new
scheme
but
later
when
the
kayanerenh
kowa
embraced
the
cayugas
messages
were
once
more
sent
to
the
powerful
onondagas
diplomatically
suggesting
that
atotarho
should
take
the
lead
in
the
grand
council
the
grim
warrior
was
mollified
by
this
sop
to
his
vanity
and
condescended
to
accept
the
proposal
not
only
that
but
he
soon
became
an
enthusiastic
worker
in
the
cause
of
confederation
and
secured
the
inclusion
of
the
senecas
in
the
league
the
confederacy
of
the
five
nations
was
now
complete
and
the
chain
as
their
grand
council
was
called
met
together
on
the
shores
of
the
salt
lake
the
number
of
chiefs
chosen
from
each
tribe
bore
some
relation
to
its
numerical
status
the
largest
number
fourteen
being
supplied
by
the
onondagas
the
office
of
representative
in
the
council
was
to
be
an
hereditary
one
descending
in
the
female
line
as
with
the
picts
of
scotland
and
other
primitive
peoples
and
never
from
father
to
son
so
powerful
did
the
league
become
that
the
name
of
house
people
was
held
in
the
greatest
awe
they
annihilated
their
ancient
enemies
the
hurons
and
they
attacked
and
subdued
the
micmacs
mohicans
pawnees
algonquins
cherokees
and
many
other
tribes
the
effect
of
the
league
on
british
history
is
incalculable
when
the
frenchman
champlain
arrived
in
he
interfered
on
behalf
of
the
hurons
an
action
whose
consequences
he
could
not
foresee
but
from
that
period
dated
the
hatred
of
the
iroquois
for
the
french
which
ensured
britain
success
in
the
long
struggle
between
the
european
nations
in
america
without
the
assistance
of
the
native
factor
who
shall
say
how
the
struggle
might
have
ended
but
the
iroquois
were
not
altogether
a
bloodthirsty
people
a
strong
bond
of
brotherhood
existed
between
the
five
nations
among
themselves
they
were
kind
and
gentle
and
in
part
at
least
hiawatha
dream
of
peace
was
realized
it
is
not
of
course
very
easy
to
say
how
far
hiawatha
intended
the
scheme
of
universal
brotherhood
with
which
he
is
credited
whether
he
conceived
a
grand
league
embracing
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
or
whether
his
full
ambition
was
realized
in
the
union
of
the
five
nations
is
a
point
which
history
does
not
make
clear
but
even
in
the
more
limited
sense
his
work
was
a
great
one
and
the
lofty
and
noble
character
which
longfellow
has
given
to
his
hero
seems
not
unsuited
to
the
actual
hiawatha
who
realizes
the
ideal
of
the
savage
more
fully
perhaps
than
any
one
else
in
the
annals
of
primitive
peoples
as
in
the
case
of
king
arthur
and
dietrich
of
berne
many
myths
soon
gathered
round
the
popular
and
revered
name
of
hiawatha
among
barbarians
three
or
even
two
generations
usually
suffice
to
render
a
great
and
outstanding
figure
mythical
but
one
prefers
to
think
of
this
iroquois
statesman
as
a
real
man
a
bright
particular
star
in
a
dark
sky
of
savagery
and
ignorance
the
stone
giants
the
iroquois
believed
that
in
early
days
there
existed
a
malignant
race
of
giants
whose
bodies
were
fashioned
out
of
stone
it
is
difficult
to
say
how
the
idea
of
such
beings
arose
but
it
is
possible
that
the
generally
distributed
conception
of
a
gigantic
race
springing
from
mother
earth
was
in
this
instance
fused
with
another
belief
that
stones
and
rocks
composed
the
earth
bony
framework
we
find
an
example
of
this
belief
in
the
beautiful
old
greek
myth
of
deucalion
and
pyrrha
which
much
resembles
that
of
noah
when
after
the
great
flood
which
submerged
hellas
the
survivors
ship
grounded
upon
mount
parnassus
they
inquired
of
the
oracle
of
themis
in
what
manner
the
human
race
might
be
restored
they
were
bidden
by
the
oracle
to
veil
themselves
and
to
throw
the
bones
of
their
mother
behind
them
these
they
interpreted
to
mean
the
stones
of
the
earth
picking
up
loose
pieces
of
stone
they
cast
them
over
their
shoulders
and
from
those
thrown
by
deucalion
there
sprang
men
while
those
cast
by
pyrrha
became
women
these
stone
giants
of
the
iroquois
dwelling
in
the
far
west
took
counsel
with
one
another
and
resolved
to
invade
the
indian
territory
and
exterminate
the
race
of
men
a
party
of
indians
just
starting
on
the
were
apprised
of
the
invasion
and
were
bidden
by
the
gods
to
challenge
the
giants
to
combat
this
they
did
and
the
opposing
bands
faced
each
other
at
a
spot
near
a
great
gulf
but
as
the
monsters
advanced
upon
their
human
enemies
the
god
of
the
west
wind
who
was
lying
in
wait
for
them
swooped
down
upon
the
titans
so
that
they
were
hurled
over
the
edge
of
the
gulf
far
down
into
the
dark
abyss
below
where
they
perished
miserably
the
pigmies
in
contradistinction
to
their
belief
in
giants
the
iroquois
imagined
the
existence
of
a
race
of
pigmies
who
had
many
of
the
attributes
of
the
teutonic
gnomes
they
were
responsible
for
the
beauty
of
terrestrial
scenery
which
they
carved
and
sculptured
in
cliff
scar
and
rock
and
like
the
they
protected
the
human
race
against
the
many
monsters
which
infested
the
world
in
early
times
witches
and
witchcraft
the
iroquois
belief
in
witchcraft
was
very
strong
and
the
following
tale
is
supposed
to
account
for
the
origin
of
witches
and
sorcery
a
boy
who
was
out
hunting
found
a
snake
the
colours
of
whose
skin
were
so
intensely
beautiful
that
he
resolved
to
capture
it
he
caught
it
and
tended
it
carefully
feeding
it
on
birds
and
small
game
and
housing
it
in
a
little
bowl
made
of
bark
which
he
filled
with
water
in
the
bottom
of
the
bowl
he
placed
down
small
feathers
and
wood
fibre
and
on
going
to
feed
the
snake
he
discovered
that
these
things
had
become
living
beings
from
this
he
gathered
that
the
reptile
was
endowed
with
supernatural
powers
and
he
found
that
other
articles
placed
in
the
water
along
with
it
soon
showed
signs
of
life
he
procured
more
snakes
and
placed
them
in
the
bowl
observing
some
men
of
the
tribe
rubbing
ointment
on
their
eyes
to
enable
them
to
see
more
clearly
he
used
some
of
the
water
from
the
bowl
in
which
the
snakes
were
immersed
upon
his
own
and
lo
he
found
on
climbing
a
tall
tree
that
nothing
was
hidden
from
his
sight
which
pierced
all
intervening
obstacles
he
could
see
far
into
the
earth
where
lay
hidden
precious
stones
and
rich
minerals
his
sight
pierced
the
trunks
of
trees
he
could
see
through
mountains
and
could
discern
objects
lying
deep
down
in
the
bed
of
a
river
he
concluded
that
the
greater
the
number
of
reptiles
the
contained
the
more
potent
would
it
become
accordingly
he
captured
several
snakes
and
suspended
them
over
his
bowl
in
such
a
manner
that
the
essential
oil
they
contained
dropped
into
the
water
with
the
result
that
the
activity
of
the
beings
which
had
been
so
strangely
bred
in
it
was
increased
in
course
of
time
he
found
that
by
merely
placing
one
of
his
fingers
in
the
liquid
and
pointing
it
at
any
person
he
could
instantly
bewitch
him
he
added
some
roots
to
the
water
in
the
bowl
some
of
which
he
then
drank
by
blowing
this
from
his
mouth
a
great
light
was
produced
by
rubbing
his
eyes
with
it
he
could
see
in
the
dark
and
by
other
applications
of
it
he
could
render
himself
invisible
or
take
the
shape
of
a
snake
if
he
dipped
an
arrow
into
the
liquid
and
discharged
it
at
any
living
being
it
would
kill
it
although
it
might
not
strike
it
not
content
with
discovering
this
magic
fluid
the
youth
resolved
to
search
for
antidotes
to
it
and
these
he
collected
a
legend
a
similar
legend
is
told
by
the
senecas
to
account
for
the
origin
of
their
nearly
two
hundred
years
ago
in
the
savage
estimation
this
is
a
very
great
period
of
time
an
indian
went
into
the
woods
on
a
hunting
expedition
one
night
while
asleep
in
his
solitary
camp
he
was
awakened
by
a
great
noise
of
singing
and
such
as
is
heard
at
festivals
starting
up
he
made
his
way
to
the
place
whence
the
sounds
came
and
although
he
could
not
see
any
one
there
he
observed
a
heap
of
corn
and
a
large
squash
vine
with
three
squashes
on
it
and
three
ears
of
corn
which
lay
apart
from
the
rest
feeling
very
uneasy
he
once
more
pursued
his
hunting
operations
and
when
night
came
again
laid
himself
down
to
rest
but
his
sleep
was
destined
to
be
broken
yet
a
second
time
and
awaking
he
perceived
a
man
bending
over
him
who
said
in
menacing
tones
beware
what
you
saw
was
sacred
you
deserve
to
die
a
rustling
among
the
branches
denoted
the
presence
of
a
number
of
people
who
after
some
hesitation
gathered
round
the
hunter
and
informed
him
that
they
would
pardon
his
curiosity
and
would
tell
him
their
secret
the
great
medicine
for
wounds
said
the
man
who
had
first
awakened
him
is
squash
and
corn
come
with
me
and
i
will
teach
you
how
to
make
and
apply
it
with
these
words
he
led
the
hunter
to
the
spot
at
which
he
had
surprised
the
operations
on
the
previous
night
where
he
beheld
a
great
fire
and
a
which
seemed
as
if
made
of
iron
chanting
a
weird
song
the
people
circled
slowly
round
the
bush
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
rattling
of
on
the
hunter
asking
them
to
explain
this
procedure
one
of
them
heated
a
stick
and
thrust
it
right
through
his
cheek
he
immediately
applied
some
of
the
to
the
wound
so
that
it
healed
instantly
having
thus
demonstrated
the
power
of
the
drug
they
sang
a
tune
which
they
called
the
which
their
pupil
learnt
by
heart
the
hunter
then
turned
to
depart
and
all
at
once
he
saw
that
the
beings
who
surrounded
him
were
not
human
as
he
had
thought
but
animals
foxes
bears
and
beavers
who
fled
as
he
looked
at
them
surprised
and
even
terrified
at
the
turn
matters
had
taken
he
made
his
way
homeward
with
all
speed
conning
over
the
prescription
which
the
strange
beings
had
given
him
the
while
they
had
told
him
to
take
one
stalk
of
corn
to
dry
the
cob
and
pound
it
very
fine
then
to
take
one
squash
cut
it
up
and
pound
it
and
to
mix
the
whole
with
water
from
a
running
stream
near
its
source
this
prescription
he
used
with
very
great
success
among
his
people
and
it
proved
the
origin
of
the
great
of
the
senecas
once
a
year
at
the
season
when
the
deer
changes
his
coat
they
prepare
it
as
the
forest
folk
did
singing
the
weird
song
and
dancing
round
it
to
the
rhythmic
accompaniment
of
the
rattles
while
they
burn
tobacco
to
the
gods
great
head
and
the
ten
brothers
it
was
commonly
believed
among
the
iroquois
indians
that
there
existed
a
curious
and
malevolent
being
whom
they
called
great
head
this
odd
creature
was
merely
an
enormous
head
poised
on
slender
legs
he
made
his
dwelling
on
a
rugged
rock
and
directly
he
saw
any
living
person
approach
he
would
growl
fiercely
in
true
ogre
fashion
i
see
thee
i
see
thee
thou
shalt
die
illustration
see
thee
i
see
thee
thou
shalt
die
far
away
in
a
remote
spot
an
orphaned
family
of
ten
boys
lived
with
their
uncle
the
older
brothers
went
out
every
day
to
hunt
but
the
younger
ones
not
yet
fitted
for
so
rigorous
a
life
remained
at
home
with
their
uncle
or
at
least
did
not
venture
much
beyond
the
immediate
vicinity
of
their
lodge
one
day
the
hunters
did
not
return
at
their
usual
hour
as
the
evening
passed
without
bringing
any
sign
of
the
missing
youths
the
little
band
at
home
became
alarmed
at
length
the
eldest
of
the
boys
left
in
the
lodge
volunteered
to
go
in
search
of
his
brothers
his
uncle
consented
and
he
set
off
but
he
did
not
return
in
the
morning
another
brother
said
i
will
go
to
seek
my
brothers
having
obtained
permission
he
went
but
he
also
did
not
come
back
another
and
another
took
upon
himself
the
task
of
finding
the
lost
hunters
but
of
the
searchers
as
well
as
of
those
sought
for
there
was
no
news
forthcoming
at
length
only
the
youngest
of
the
lads
remained
at
home
and
to
his
entreaties
to
be
allowed
to
seek
for
his
brothers
the
uncle
turned
a
deaf
ear
for
he
feared
to
lose
the
last
of
his
young
nephews
one
day
when
uncle
and
nephew
were
out
in
the
forest
the
latter
fancied
he
heard
a
deep
groan
which
seemed
to
proceed
from
the
earth
exactly
under
his
feet
they
stopped
to
listen
the
sound
was
repeated
unmistakably
a
human
groan
hastily
they
began
digging
in
the
earth
and
in
a
moment
or
two
came
upon
a
man
covered
with
mould
and
apparently
unconscious
the
pair
carried
the
unfortunate
one
to
their
lodge
where
they
rubbed
him
with
bear
oil
till
he
recovered
consciousness
when
he
was
able
to
speak
he
could
give
no
explanation
of
how
he
came
to
be
buried
alive
he
had
been
out
hunting
he
said
when
suddenly
his
mind
became
a
blank
and
he
remembered
nothing
more
till
he
found
himself
in
the
lodge
with
the
old
man
and
the
boy
his
hosts
begged
the
stranger
to
stay
with
them
and
they
soon
discovered
that
he
was
no
ordinary
mortal
but
a
powerful
magician
at
times
he
behaved
very
strangely
one
night
while
a
great
storm
raged
without
he
tossed
restlessly
on
his
couch
instead
of
going
to
sleep
at
last
he
sought
the
old
uncle
do
you
hear
that
noise
he
said
that
is
my
brother
great
head
who
is
riding
on
the
wind
do
you
not
hear
him
howling
the
old
man
considered
this
astounding
speech
for
a
moment
then
he
asked
would
he
come
here
if
you
sent
for
him
no
said
the
other
thoughtfully
but
we
might
bring
him
here
by
magic
should
he
come
you
must
have
food
ready
for
him
in
the
shape
of
huge
blocks
of
for
that
is
what
he
lives
on
the
stranger
departed
in
search
of
his
brother
great
head
taking
with
him
his
bow
and
on
the
way
he
came
across
a
whose
roots
provided
him
with
arrows
about
midday
he
drew
near
to
the
dwelling
of
his
brother
great
head
in
order
to
see
without
being
seen
he
changed
himself
into
a
mole
and
crept
through
the
grass
till
he
saw
great
head
perched
on
a
rock
frowning
fiercely
i
see
thee
he
growled
with
his
wild
eyes
fixed
on
an
owl
the
drew
his
bow
and
shot
an
arrow
at
great
head
the
arrow
became
larger
and
larger
as
it
flew
toward
the
monster
but
it
returned
to
him
who
had
fired
it
and
as
it
did
so
it
regained
its
natural
size
the
man
seized
it
and
rushed
back
the
way
he
had
come
very
soon
he
heard
great
head
in
pursuit
puffing
and
snorting
along
on
the
wings
of
a
hurricane
when
the
creature
had
almost
overtaken
him
he
turned
and
discharged
another
arrow
again
and
again
he
repulsed
his
pursuer
in
this
fashion
till
he
lured
him
to
the
lodge
where
his
benefactors
lived
when
great
head
burst
into
the
house
the
uncle
and
nephew
began
to
hammer
him
vigorously
with
mallets
to
their
surprise
the
monster
broke
into
laughter
for
he
had
recognized
his
brother
and
was
very
pleased
to
see
him
he
ate
the
they
brought
him
with
a
hearty
appetite
whereupon
they
told
him
the
story
of
the
missing
hunters
i
know
what
has
become
of
them
said
great
head
they
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
a
witch
if
this
young
man
indicating
the
nephew
will
accompany
me
i
will
show
him
her
dwelling
and
the
bones
of
his
brothers
the
youth
who
loved
adventure
and
was
besides
very
anxious
to
learn
the
fate
of
his
brothers
at
once
consented
to
seek
the
home
of
the
witch
so
he
and
great
head
started
off
and
lost
no
time
in
getting
to
the
place
they
found
the
space
in
front
of
the
lodge
strewn
with
dry
bones
and
the
witch
sitting
in
the
doorway
singing
when
she
saw
them
she
muttered
the
magic
word
which
turned
living
people
into
dry
bones
but
on
great
head
and
his
companion
it
had
no
effect
whatever
acting
on
a
prearranged
signal
great
head
and
the
youth
attacked
the
witch
and
killed
her
no
sooner
had
she
expired
than
her
flesh
turned
into
birds
and
beasts
and
fishes
what
was
left
of
her
they
burned
to
ashes
their
next
act
was
to
select
the
bones
of
the
nine
brothers
from
among
the
heap
and
this
they
found
no
easy
task
but
at
last
it
was
accomplished
and
great
head
said
to
his
companion
i
am
going
home
to
my
rock
when
i
pass
overhead
in
a
great
storm
i
will
bid
these
bones
arise
and
they
will
get
up
and
return
with
you
the
youth
stood
alone
for
a
little
while
till
he
heard
the
sound
of
a
fierce
tempest
out
of
the
hurricane
great
head
called
to
the
brothers
to
arise
in
a
moment
they
were
all
on
their
feet
receiving
the
congratulations
of
their
younger
brother
and
each
other
and
filled
with
joy
at
their
reunion
the
seneca
revenge
a
striking
story
is
told
of
a
seneca
youth
who
for
many
years
and
through
a
wearisome
captivity
nourished
the
hope
of
vengeance
so
dear
to
the
indian
soul
a
certain
tribe
of
the
senecas
had
settled
on
the
shores
of
lake
erie
when
they
were
surprised
by
their
ancient
enemies
the
illinois
and
in
spite
of
a
stout
resistance
many
of
them
were
slain
and
a
woman
and
a
boy
taken
prisoner
when
the
victors
halted
for
the
night
they
built
a
great
fire
and
proceeded
to
celebrate
their
success
by
singing
triumphant
songs
in
which
they
commanded
the
boy
to
join
them
the
lad
pretended
that
he
did
not
know
their
language
but
said
that
he
would
sing
their
song
in
his
own
tongue
to
which
they
assented
but
instead
of
a
pæan
in
their
praise
he
sang
a
song
of
vengeance
in
which
he
vowed
that
if
he
were
spared
all
of
them
would
lose
their
scalps
a
few
days
afterward
the
woman
became
so
exhausted
that
she
could
walk
no
farther
so
the
illinois
slew
her
but
before
she
died
she
extracted
a
promise
from
the
boy
that
he
would
avenge
her
and
would
never
cease
to
be
a
seneca
in
a
few
days
they
arrived
at
the
illinois
camp
where
a
council
was
held
to
consider
the
fate
of
the
captive
lad
some
were
for
instantly
putting
him
to
death
but
their
chief
ruled
that
should
he
be
able
to
live
through
their
tortures
he
would
be
worthy
of
becoming
an
illinois
they
seized
the
wretched
lad
and
held
his
bare
feet
to
the
glowing
then
after
piercing
them
they
told
him
to
run
a
race
he
bounded
forward
and
ran
so
swiftly
that
he
soon
gained
the
great
house
of
the
tribe
where
he
seated
himself
upon
a
skin
another
council
was
held
and
the
illinois
braves
agreed
that
the
lad
possessed
high
courage
and
would
make
a
great
warrior
but
others
argued
that
he
knew
their
and
might
betray
them
and
it
was
finally
decided
that
he
should
be
burnt
at
the
stake
as
he
was
about
to
perish
in
this
manner
an
aged
warrior
suggested
that
if
he
were
able
to
withstand
their
last
torture
he
should
be
permitted
to
live
accordingly
he
held
the
unfortunate
lad
under
water
in
a
pool
until
only
a
spark
of
life
remained
in
him
but
he
survived
and
became
an
illinois
warrior
years
passed
and
the
boy
reached
manhood
and
married
a
chief
daughter
his
strength
and
endurance
became
proverbial
but
the
warriors
of
the
tribe
of
his
adoption
would
never
permit
him
to
take
part
in
their
warlike
expeditions
at
length
a
raid
against
the
senecas
was
mooted
and
he
begged
so
hard
to
be
allowed
to
accompany
the
braves
that
at
last
they
consented
indeed
so
great
was
their
admiration
of
the
skill
with
which
he
outlined
a
plan
of
campaign
that
they
made
him
chief
of
the
expedition
for
many
days
the
party
marched
toward
the
seneca
country
but
when
at
last
they
neared
it
their
scouts
reported
that
there
were
no
signs
of
the
tribe
and
that
the
senecas
must
have
quitted
their
territory
their
leader
however
proposed
to
go
in
search
of
the
enemy
himself
along
with
another
warrior
of
the
tribe
and
this
was
agreed
to
when
the
pair
had
gone
five
or
six
miles
the
leader
said
to
his
companion
that
it
would
be
better
if
they
separated
as
they
would
then
be
able
to
cover
more
ground
passing
on
to
where
he
knew
he
would
find
the
senecas
he
warned
them
of
their
danger
and
arranged
that
an
ambush
of
his
kinsfolk
should
lie
in
wait
for
the
illinois
returning
to
the
illinois
camp
he
reported
that
he
had
seen
nothing
but
that
he
well
remembered
the
seneca
he
asked
to
be
given
the
bravest
warriors
and
assured
the
council
that
he
would
soon
bring
them
the
scalps
of
their
foes
suspecting
nothing
they
assented
to
his
proposal
and
he
was
followed
by
the
flower
of
the
illinois
tribe
all
unaware
that
five
hundred
senecas
awaited
them
in
the
valley
the
youth
led
his
men
right
into
the
heart
of
the
ambush
then
pretending
to
miss
his
footing
he
fell
this
was
the
signal
for
the
senecas
to
rise
on
every
side
yelling
their
they
rushed
from
their
shelter
and
fell
on
the
dismayed
illinois
who
gave
way
on
every
side
the
slaughter
was
immense
vengeance
nerved
the
arms
of
the
seneca
braves
and
of
three
hundred
illinois
but
two
escaped
the
leader
of
the
expedition
was
borne
in
triumph
to
the
seneca
village
where
to
listening
hundreds
he
told
the
story
of
his
capture
and
revenge
he
became
a
great
chief
among
his
people
and
even
to
this
day
his
name
is
uttered
by
them
with
honour
and
reverence
the
boy
magician
in
the
heart
of
the
wilderness
there
lived
an
old
woman
and
her
little
grandson
the
two
found
no
lack
of
occupation
from
day
to
day
the
woman
busying
herself
with
cooking
and
cleaning
and
the
boy
with
shooting
and
hunting
the
grandmother
frequently
spoke
of
the
time
when
the
child
would
grow
up
and
go
out
into
the
world
always
go
to
the
east
she
would
say
never
go
to
the
west
for
there
lies
danger
but
what
the
danger
was
she
would
not
tell
him
in
spite
of
his
importunate
questioning
other
boys
went
west
he
thought
to
himself
and
why
should
not
he
nevertheless
his
grandmother
made
him
promise
that
he
would
not
go
west
years
passed
by
and
the
child
grew
to
be
a
man
though
he
still
retained
the
curiosity
and
high
spirits
of
his
boyhood
his
persistent
inquiries
drew
from
the
old
grandmother
a
reluctant
explanation
of
her
warning
in
the
west
said
she
there
dwells
a
being
who
is
anxious
to
do
us
harm
if
he
sees
you
it
will
mean
death
for
both
of
us
this
statement
instead
of
frightening
the
young
indian
only
strengthened
in
him
a
secret
resolution
he
had
formed
to
go
west
on
the
first
opportunity
not
that
he
wished
to
bring
any
misfortune
on
his
poor
old
grandmother
any
more
than
on
himself
but
he
trusted
to
his
strong
arm
and
clear
head
to
deliver
them
from
their
enemy
so
with
a
laugh
on
his
lips
he
set
off
to
the
west
toward
evening
he
came
to
a
lake
where
he
rested
he
had
not
been
there
long
when
he
heard
a
voice
saying
aha
my
fine
fellow
i
see
you
the
youth
looked
all
round
him
and
up
into
the
sky
above
but
he
saw
no
one
i
am
going
to
send
a
hurricane
the
mysterious
voice
continued
to
break
your
grandmother
hut
to
pieces
how
will
you
like
that
oh
very
well
answered
the
young
man
gaily
we
are
always
in
need
of
firewood
and
now
we
shall
have
plenty
go
home
and
see
the
voice
said
mockingly
i
daresay
you
will
not
like
it
so
well
nothing
daunted
the
young
adventurer
retraced
his
steps
as
he
neared
home
a
great
wind
sprang
up
seeming
to
tear
the
very
trees
out
by
the
roots
make
haste
cried
the
grandmother
from
the
doorway
we
shall
both
be
killed
when
she
had
drawn
him
inside
and
shut
the
door
she
scolded
him
heartily
for
his
disobedience
and
bewailed
the
fate
before
them
the
young
man
soothed
her
fears
saying
do
cry
grandmother
we
shall
turn
the
lodge
into
a
rock
and
so
we
shall
be
saved
having
some
skill
in
magic
he
did
as
he
had
said
and
the
hurricane
passed
harmlessly
over
their
heads
when
it
had
ceased
they
emerged
from
their
retreat
and
found
an
abundance
of
firewood
all
round
them
the
hailstorm
next
day
the
youth
was
on
the
point
of
setting
off
toward
the
west
once
more
but
the
urgent
entreaties
of
his
grandmother
moved
him
to
proceed
eastward
for
a
time
directly
he
was
out
of
sight
of
the
lodge
he
turned
his
face
once
more
to
the
west
arrived
at
the
lake
he
heard
the
voice
once
more
though
its
owner
was
still
invisible
i
am
going
to
send
a
great
hailstorm
on
your
grandmother
hut
it
said
what
do
you
think
of
that
oh
was
the
response
i
think
i
should
like
it
i
have
always
wanted
a
bundle
of
spears
go
home
and
see
said
the
voice
away
the
youth
went
through
the
woods
the
sky
became
darker
and
darker
as
he
neared
his
home
and
just
as
he
was
within
a
bowshot
of
the
little
hut
a
fierce
hailstorm
broke
and
he
thought
he
would
be
killed
before
he
reached
shelter
alas
cried
the
old
woman
when
he
was
safely
indoors
we
shall
be
destroyed
this
time
how
can
we
save
ourselves
again
the
young
man
exercised
his
magic
powers
and
transformed
the
frail
hut
into
a
hollow
rock
upon
which
the
shafts
of
the
hailstorm
spent
themselves
in
vain
at
last
the
sky
cleared
the
lodge
resumed
its
former
shape
and
the
young
man
saw
a
multitude
of
sharp
beautiful
on
the
ground
i
will
get
poles
said
he
to
fit
to
them
for
fishing
when
he
returned
in
a
few
minutes
with
the
poles
he
found
that
the
spears
had
vanished
where
are
my
beautiful
spears
he
asked
his
grandmother
they
were
only
she
replied
they
have
all
melted
away
the
young
indian
was
greatly
disappointed
and
wondered
how
he
could
avenge
himself
on
the
being
who
had
played
him
this
malicious
trick
be
warned
in
time
said
the
aged
grandmother
shaking
her
head
at
him
take
my
advice
and
leave
him
alone
the
charmed
stone
but
the
youth
adventurous
spirit
impelled
him
to
see
the
end
of
the
matter
so
he
took
a
stone
and
tied
it
round
his
neck
for
a
charm
and
sought
the
lake
once
again
carefully
observing
the
direction
from
which
the
voice
proceeded
he
saw
in
the
middle
of
the
lake
a
huge
head
with
a
face
on
every
side
of
it
aha
uncle
he
exclaimed
i
see
you
how
would
you
like
it
if
the
lake
dried
up
nonsense
said
the
voice
angrily
that
will
never
happen
go
home
and
see
shouted
the
youth
mimicking
the
mocking
tone
the
other
had
adopted
on
the
previous
occasions
as
he
spoke
he
swung
his
charmed
stone
round
his
head
and
threw
it
into
the
air
as
it
descended
it
grew
larger
and
larger
and
the
moment
it
entered
the
lake
the
water
began
to
boil
the
lad
returned
home
and
told
his
grandmother
what
he
had
done
it
is
of
no
use
said
she
many
have
tried
to
slay
him
but
all
have
perished
in
the
attempt
next
morning
our
hero
went
westward
again
and
found
the
lake
quite
dry
and
the
animals
in
it
dead
with
the
exception
of
a
large
green
frog
who
was
in
reality
the
malicious
being
who
had
tormented
the
indian
and
his
grandmother
a
quick
blow
with
a
stick
put
an
end
to
the
creature
and
the
triumphant
youth
bore
the
good
news
to
his
old
grandmother
who
from
that
time
was
left
in
peace
and
quietness
the
friendly
skeleton
a
little
boy
living
in
the
woods
with
his
old
uncle
was
warned
by
him
not
to
go
eastward
but
to
play
close
to
the
lodge
or
walk
toward
the
west
the
child
felt
a
natural
curiosity
to
know
what
lay
in
the
forbidden
direction
and
one
day
took
advantage
of
his
absence
on
a
hunting
expedition
to
wander
away
to
the
east
at
length
he
came
to
a
large
lake
on
the
shores
of
which
he
stopped
to
rest
here
he
was
accosted
by
a
man
who
asked
him
his
name
and
where
he
lived
come
said
the
stranger
when
he
had
finished
questioning
the
boy
let
us
see
who
can
shoot
an
arrow
the
highest
this
they
did
and
the
boy
arrow
went
much
higher
than
that
of
his
companion
the
stranger
then
suggested
a
swimming
match
let
us
see
he
said
who
can
swim
farthest
under
water
without
taking
a
breath
again
the
boy
beat
his
rival
who
next
proposed
that
they
should
sail
out
to
an
island
in
the
middle
of
the
lake
to
see
the
beautiful
birds
that
were
to
be
found
there
the
child
consented
readily
and
they
embarked
in
a
curious
canoe
which
was
propelled
by
three
swans
harnessed
to
either
side
of
it
directly
they
had
taken
their
seats
the
man
began
to
sing
and
the
canoe
moved
off
in
a
very
short
time
they
had
reached
the
island
here
the
little
indian
realized
that
his
confidence
in
his
friend
was
misplaced
the
stranger
took
all
his
clothes
from
him
put
them
in
the
canoe
and
jumped
in
himself
saying
come
swans
let
us
go
home
the
obedient
swans
set
off
at
a
good
pace
and
soon
left
the
island
far
behind
the
boy
was
very
angry
at
having
been
so
badly
used
but
when
it
grew
dark
his
resentment
changed
to
fear
and
he
sat
down
and
cried
with
cold
and
misery
suddenly
he
heard
a
husky
voice
close
at
hand
and
looking
round
he
saw
a
skeleton
on
the
ground
i
am
very
sorry
for
you
said
the
skeleton
in
hoarse
tones
i
will
do
what
i
can
to
help
you
but
first
you
must
do
something
for
me
go
and
dig
by
that
tree
and
you
shall
find
a
with
some
tobacco
in
it
a
pipe
and
a
flint
the
boy
did
as
he
was
asked
and
when
he
had
filled
the
pipe
he
lit
it
and
placed
it
in
the
mouth
of
the
skeleton
he
saw
that
the
latter
body
was
full
of
mice
and
that
the
smoke
frightened
them
away
illustration
he
lit
a
pipe
and
placed
it
in
the
mouth
of
the
skeleton
there
is
a
man
coming
with
three
dogs
said
the
skeleton
he
is
coming
to
look
for
you
you
must
make
tracks
all
over
the
island
so
that
they
may
not
find
you
and
then
hide
in
a
hollow
tree
again
the
boy
obeyed
his
gaunt
instructor
and
when
he
was
safely
hidden
he
saw
a
man
come
ashore
with
three
dogs
all
night
they
hunted
him
but
he
had
made
so
many
tracks
that
the
dogs
were
confused
and
at
last
the
man
departed
in
anger
next
day
the
trembling
boy
emerged
and
went
to
the
skeleton
said
the
latter
the
man
who
brought
you
here
is
coming
to
drink
your
blood
you
must
dig
a
hole
in
the
sand
and
hide
when
he
comes
out
of
the
canoe
you
must
enter
it
say
swans
let
us
go
home
and
if
the
man
calls
you
do
not
look
back
the
lost
sister
everything
fell
out
as
the
skeleton
had
foretold
the
boy
hid
in
the
sand
and
directly
he
saw
his
tormentor
step
ashore
he
jumped
into
the
canoe
saying
hastily
come
swans
let
us
go
home
then
he
began
to
sing
as
he
had
heard
the
man
do
when
they
first
embarked
in
vain
the
man
called
him
back
he
refused
to
look
round
the
swans
carried
the
canoe
to
a
cave
in
a
high
rock
where
the
boy
found
his
clothes
as
well
as
a
fire
and
food
when
he
had
donned
his
garments
and
satisfied
his
hunger
he
lay
down
and
slept
in
the
morning
he
returned
to
the
island
where
he
found
the
tyrant
quite
dead
the
skeleton
now
commanded
him
to
sail
eastward
to
seek
for
his
sister
whom
a
fierce
man
had
carried
away
he
set
out
eagerly
on
his
new
quest
and
a
three
days
journey
brought
him
to
the
place
where
his
sister
was
he
lost
no
time
in
finding
her
come
my
sister
said
he
let
us
flee
away
together
alas
i
can
not
answered
the
young
woman
a
wicked
man
keeps
me
here
it
is
time
for
him
to
return
home
and
he
would
be
sure
to
catch
us
but
let
me
hide
you
now
and
in
the
morning
we
shall
go
away
so
she
dug
a
pit
and
hid
her
brother
though
not
a
moment
too
soon
for
the
footsteps
of
her
husband
were
heard
approaching
the
hut
the
woman
had
cooked
a
child
and
this
she
placed
before
the
man
you
have
had
visitors
he
said
seeing
his
dogs
snuffing
around
uneasily
no
was
the
reply
i
have
seen
no
one
but
you
i
shall
wait
till
said
the
man
to
himself
then
i
shall
kill
and
eat
him
he
had
already
guessed
that
his
wife
had
not
spoken
the
truth
however
he
said
nothing
more
but
waited
till
morning
when
instead
of
going
to
a
distant
swamp
to
seek
for
food
as
he
pretended
to
do
he
concealed
himself
at
a
short
distance
from
the
hut
and
at
length
saw
the
brother
and
sister
making
for
a
canoe
they
were
hardly
seated
when
they
saw
him
running
toward
them
in
his
hand
he
bore
a
large
hook
with
which
he
caught
the
frail
vessel
but
the
lad
broke
the
hook
with
a
stone
and
the
canoe
darted
out
on
to
the
lake
the
man
was
at
a
loss
for
a
moment
and
could
only
shout
incoherent
threats
after
the
pair
then
an
idea
occurred
to
him
and
lying
down
on
the
shore
he
began
to
drink
the
water
this
caused
the
canoe
to
rush
back
again
but
once
more
the
boy
was
equal
to
the
occasion
seizing
the
large
stone
with
which
he
had
broken
the
hook
he
threw
it
at
the
man
and
slew
him
the
water
at
the
same
time
rushing
back
into
the
lake
thus
the
brother
and
sister
escaped
and
in
three
days
they
had
arrived
at
the
island
where
they
heartily
thanked
their
benefactor
the
skeleton
he
however
had
still
another
task
for
the
young
indian
to
perform
take
your
sister
home
to
your
uncle
lodge
said
he
then
return
here
yourself
and
say
to
the
many
bones
which
you
will
find
on
the
island
and
they
shall
come
to
life
again
when
the
brother
and
sister
reached
their
home
they
found
that
their
old
uncle
had
been
grievously
lamenting
the
loss
of
his
nephew
and
he
was
quite
overjoyed
at
seeing
them
on
his
recommendation
they
built
a
large
lodge
to
accommodate
the
people
they
were
to
bring
back
with
them
when
it
was
completed
the
youth
revisited
the
island
bade
the
bones
arise
and
was
delighted
to
see
them
obey
his
bidding
and
become
men
and
women
he
led
them
to
the
lodge
he
had
built
where
they
all
dwelt
happily
for
a
long
time
the
pigmies
when
the
cherokees
were
dwelling
in
the
swamps
of
florida
the
iroquois
made
a
practice
of
swooping
down
on
them
and
raiding
their
camps
on
one
occasion
the
raiding
party
was
absent
from
home
for
close
on
two
years
on
the
eve
of
their
return
one
of
their
number
a
chieftain
fell
ill
and
the
rest
of
the
party
were
at
a
loss
to
know
what
to
do
with
him
obviously
if
they
carried
him
home
with
them
he
would
considerably
impede
their
progress
besides
there
was
the
possibility
that
he
might
not
recover
and
all
their
labour
would
be
to
no
purpose
thus
they
debated
far
into
the
night
and
finally
decided
to
abandon
him
to
his
fate
and
return
by
themselves
the
sick
man
unable
to
stir
hand
or
foot
overheard
their
decision
but
he
bore
it
stoically
like
an
indian
warrior
nevertheless
when
he
heard
the
last
swish
of
their
paddles
as
they
crossed
the
river
he
could
not
help
thinking
of
the
friends
and
kindred
he
would
probably
never
see
again
when
the
raiders
reached
home
they
were
closely
questioned
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
the
missing
chief
and
the
inquiries
were
all
the
more
anxious
because
the
sick
man
had
been
a
great
favourite
among
his
people
the
guilty
warriors
answered
evasively
they
did
not
know
what
had
become
of
their
comrade
they
said
possibly
he
had
been
lost
or
killed
in
florida
meanwhile
the
sick
man
lay
dying
on
the
banks
of
the
river
suddenly
he
heard
quite
close
at
hand
the
gentle
sound
of
a
canoe
the
vessel
drew
in
close
to
the
bank
and
full
in
view
of
the
warrior
three
pigmy
men
disembarked
they
regarded
the
stranger
with
some
surprise
at
length
one
who
seemed
to
be
the
leader
advanced
and
spoke
to
him
bidding
him
await
their
return
and
promising
to
look
after
him
they
were
going
he
said
to
a
certain
where
many
curious
animals
watered
in
order
to
kill
some
for
food
the
when
the
pigmies
arrived
at
the
place
they
found
that
no
animals
were
as
yet
to
be
seen
but
very
soon
a
large
buffalo
bull
came
to
drink
immediately
a
buffalo
cow
arose
from
the
lick
and
when
they
had
satisfied
their
thirst
the
two
animals
lay
down
on
the
bank
the
pigmies
concluded
that
the
time
was
ripe
for
killing
them
and
drawing
their
bows
they
succeeded
in
dispatching
the
buffaloes
returning
to
the
sick
man
they
amply
fulfilled
their
promise
to
take
care
of
him
skilfully
tending
him
until
he
had
made
a
complete
recovery
they
then
conveyed
him
to
his
friends
who
now
learnt
that
the
story
told
them
by
the
raiders
was
false
bitterly
indignant
at
the
deception
and
heartless
cruelty
of
these
men
they
fell
upon
them
and
punished
them
according
to
their
deserts
later
the
chief
headed
a
band
of
people
who
were
curious
to
see
the
lick
which
they
found
surrounded
by
the
bones
of
numberless
large
animals
which
had
been
killed
by
the
pigmies
this
story
is
interesting
as
a
record
of
what
were
perhaps
the
last
vestiges
of
a
pigmy
folk
who
at
one
time
inhabited
the
eastern
portion
of
north
america
before
the
coming
of
the
red
man
we
have
already
alluded
to
this
people
in
the
pages
dealing
with
the
discoveries
of
the
norsemen
in
the
continent
the
magical
serpent
in
the
seventeenth
century
a
strange
legend
concerning
a
huge
serpent
was
found
among
the
hurons
who
probably
got
it
from
the
neighbouring
algonquins
this
monster
had
on
its
head
a
horn
which
would
pierce
anything
even
the
hardest
rock
any
one
possessing
a
piece
of
it
was
supposed
to
have
very
good
fortune
the
hurons
did
not
know
where
the
creature
was
to
be
found
but
said
that
the
algonquins
were
in
the
habit
of
selling
them
small
pieces
of
the
magic
horn
it
is
possible
that
the
mercenary
shawnees
had
borrowed
this
myth
from
the
cherokees
for
their
own
purposes
at
all
events
a
similar
legend
existed
among
both
tribes
which
told
of
a
monster
snake
the
king
of
rattlesnakes
who
dwelt
up
among
the
attended
by
a
retinue
of
his
kind
instead
of
a
crown
he
wore
on
his
head
a
beautiful
jewel
which
possessed
magic
properties
many
a
brave
tried
to
obtain
possession
of
this
desirable
gem
but
all
fell
victims
to
the
venomous
reptiles
at
length
a
more
ingenious
warrior
clothed
himself
entirely
in
leather
and
so
rendered
himself
impervious
to
their
attack
making
his
way
to
the
haunt
of
the
serpents
he
slew
their
monster
chief
then
triumphantly
taking
possession
of
the
wonderful
jewel
he
bore
it
to
his
tribe
by
whom
it
was
regarded
with
profound
veneration
and
jealously
preserved
the
origin
of
medicine
an
interesting
cherokee
myth
is
that
which
recounts
the
origin
of
disease
and
the
consequent
institution
of
curative
medicine
in
the
old
days
we
are
told
the
members
of
the
brute
creation
were
gifted
with
speech
and
dwelt
in
amity
with
the
human
race
but
mankind
multiplied
so
quickly
that
the
animals
were
crowded
into
the
forests
and
desert
places
of
the
earth
so
that
the
old
friendship
between
them
was
soon
forgotten
the
breach
was
farther
widened
by
the
invention
of
lethal
weapons
by
the
aid
of
which
man
commenced
the
wholesale
slaughter
of
the
beasts
for
the
sake
of
their
flesh
and
skins
the
animals
at
first
surprised
soon
grew
angry
and
resolved
upon
measures
of
retaliation
the
bear
tribe
met
in
council
presided
over
by
the
old
white
bear
their
chief
after
several
speakers
had
denounced
mankind
for
their
bloodthirsty
tendencies
war
was
unanimously
decided
upon
but
the
lack
of
weapons
was
regarded
as
a
serious
drawback
however
it
was
suggested
that
man
instruments
should
be
turned
against
himself
and
as
the
bow
and
arrow
were
considered
to
be
the
principal
human
agency
of
destruction
it
was
resolved
to
fashion
a
specimen
a
suitable
piece
of
wood
was
procured
and
one
of
the
bears
sacrificed
himself
to
provide
gut
for
a
bowstring
when
the
weapon
was
completed
it
was
discovered
that
the
claws
of
the
bears
spoiled
their
shooting
one
of
the
bears
however
cut
his
claws
and
succeeded
in
hitting
the
mark
but
the
old
white
bear
very
wisely
remarked
that
without
claws
they
could
not
climb
trees
or
bring
down
game
and
that
were
they
to
cut
them
off
they
must
all
starve
the
deer
also
met
in
council
under
their
chief
the
little
deer
when
it
was
decided
that
those
hunters
who
slew
one
of
their
number
without
asking
pardon
in
a
suitable
manner
should
be
afflicted
with
rheumatism
they
gave
notice
of
this
decision
to
the
nearest
settlement
of
indians
and
instructed
them
how
to
make
propitiation
when
forced
by
necessity
to
kill
one
of
the
so
when
a
deer
is
slain
by
the
hunter
the
little
deer
runs
to
the
spot
and
bending
over
the
asks
the
spirit
of
the
deer
if
it
has
heard
the
prayer
of
the
hunter
for
pardon
if
the
reply
be
all
is
well
and
the
little
deer
departs
but
if
the
answer
be
in
the
negative
he
tracks
the
hunter
to
his
cabin
and
strikes
him
with
rheumatism
so
that
he
becomes
a
helpless
cripple
sometimes
hunters
who
have
not
learned
the
proper
formula
for
pardon
attempt
to
turn
aside
the
little
deer
from
his
pursuit
by
building
a
fire
behind
them
in
the
trail
the
council
of
the
fishes
the
fishes
and
reptiles
then
held
a
joint
council
and
arranged
to
haunt
those
human
beings
who
tormented
them
with
hideous
dreams
of
serpents
twining
round
them
and
of
eating
fish
which
had
become
decayed
these
snake
and
fish
dreams
seem
to
be
of
common
occurrence
among
the
cherokees
and
the
services
of
the
to
banish
them
are
in
constant
demand
lastly
the
birds
and
the
insects
with
the
smaller
animals
gathered
together
for
a
similar
purpose
the
presiding
over
the
meeting
each
in
turn
expressed
an
opinion
and
the
consensus
was
against
mankind
they
devised
and
named
various
diseases
when
the
plants
which
were
friendly
to
man
heard
what
had
been
arranged
by
the
animals
they
determined
to
frustrate
their
evil
designs
each
tree
shrub
and
herb
down
even
to
the
grasses
and
mosses
agreed
to
furnish
a
remedy
for
some
one
of
the
diseases
named
thus
did
medicine
come
into
being
when
the
is
in
doubt
as
to
what
treatment
to
apply
for
the
relief
of
a
patient
the
spirit
of
the
plant
suggests
a
fitting
remedy
the
wonderful
kettle
a
story
is
told
among
the
iroquois
of
two
brothers
who
lived
in
the
wilderness
far
from
all
human
habitation
the
elder
brother
went
into
the
forest
to
hunt
game
while
the
younger
stayed
at
home
and
tended
the
hut
cooked
the
food
and
gathered
firewood
one
evening
the
tired
hunter
returned
from
the
chase
and
the
younger
brother
took
the
game
from
him
as
usual
and
dressed
it
for
supper
i
will
smoke
awhile
before
i
eat
said
the
hunter
and
he
smoked
in
silence
for
a
time
when
he
was
tired
of
smoking
he
lay
down
and
went
to
sleep
strange
said
the
boy
i
should
have
thought
he
would
want
to
eat
first
when
the
hunter
awoke
he
found
that
his
brother
had
prepared
the
supper
and
was
waiting
for
him
go
to
bed
said
he
i
wish
to
be
alone
wondering
much
the
boy
did
as
he
was
bidden
but
he
could
not
help
asking
himself
how
his
brother
could
possibly
live
if
he
did
not
eat
in
the
morning
he
observed
that
the
hunter
went
away
without
tasting
any
food
and
on
many
succeeding
mornings
and
evenings
the
same
thing
happened
i
must
watch
him
at
night
said
the
boy
to
himself
for
he
must
eat
at
night
since
he
eats
at
no
other
time
that
same
evening
when
the
lad
was
told
as
usual
to
go
to
bed
he
lay
down
and
pretended
to
be
sound
asleep
but
all
the
time
one
of
his
eyes
was
open
in
this
cautious
fashion
he
watched
his
brother
and
saw
him
rise
from
his
couch
and
pass
through
a
in
the
floor
from
which
he
shortly
emerged
bearing
a
rusty
kettle
the
bottom
of
which
he
scraped
industriously
filling
it
with
water
he
set
it
on
the
blazing
fire
as
he
did
so
he
struck
it
with
a
whip
saying
at
every
blow
grow
larger
my
kettle
the
obedient
kettle
became
of
gigantic
proportions
and
after
setting
it
aside
to
cool
the
man
ate
its
contents
with
evident
relish
his
watchful
younger
brother
well
content
with
the
result
of
his
observation
turned
over
and
went
to
sleep
when
the
elder
had
set
off
next
morning
the
boy
filled
with
curiosity
opened
the
and
discovered
the
kettle
i
wonder
what
he
eats
he
said
and
there
within
the
vessel
was
half
a
chestnut
he
was
rather
surprised
at
this
discovery
but
he
thought
to
himself
how
pleased
his
brother
would
be
if
on
his
return
he
found
a
meal
to
his
taste
awaiting
him
when
evening
drew
near
he
put
the
kettle
on
the
fire
took
a
whip
and
hitting
it
repeatedly
exclaimed
grow
larger
my
kettle
illustration
larger
my
kettle
the
kettle
grew
larger
but
to
the
boy
alarm
it
kept
on
growing
until
it
filled
the
room
and
he
was
obliged
to
get
on
the
roof
and
stir
it
through
the
chimney
what
are
you
doing
up
there
shouted
the
hunter
when
he
came
within
hail
i
took
your
kettle
to
get
your
supper
ready
answered
the
boy
alas
cried
the
other
now
i
must
die
he
quickly
reduced
the
kettle
to
its
original
proportions
and
put
it
in
its
place
but
he
still
wore
such
a
sad
and
serious
air
that
his
brother
was
filled
with
dismay
and
prayed
that
he
might
be
permitted
to
undo
the
mischief
he
had
wrought
when
the
days
went
past
and
he
found
that
his
brother
no
longer
went
out
to
hunt
or
displayed
any
interest
in
life
but
grew
gradually
thinner
and
more
melancholy
his
distress
knew
no
bounds
let
me
fetch
you
some
chestnuts
he
begged
earnestly
tell
me
where
they
may
be
found
the
white
heron
you
must
travel
a
full
day
journey
said
the
hunter
in
response
to
his
entreaties
you
will
then
reach
a
river
which
is
most
difficult
to
ford
on
the
opposite
bank
there
stands
a
lodge
and
near
by
a
even
then
your
difficulties
will
only
be
begun
the
tree
is
guarded
by
a
white
heron
which
never
loses
sight
of
it
for
a
moment
he
is
employed
for
that
purpose
by
the
six
women
who
live
in
the
lodge
and
with
their
they
slay
any
one
who
has
the
temerity
to
approach
i
beg
of
you
do
not
think
of
going
on
such
a
hopeless
errand
but
the
boy
felt
that
were
the
chance
of
success
even
more
slender
he
must
make
the
attempt
for
the
sake
of
his
brother
whom
his
thoughtlessness
had
brought
low
he
made
a
little
canoe
about
three
inches
long
and
set
off
on
his
journey
in
the
direction
indicated
by
his
brother
at
the
end
of
a
day
he
came
to
the
river
whose
size
had
not
been
underestimated
taking
his
little
canoe
from
his
pocket
he
drew
it
out
till
it
was
of
a
suitable
length
and
launched
it
in
the
great
stream
a
few
minutes
sufficed
to
carry
him
to
the
opposite
bank
and
there
he
beheld
the
lodge
and
the
on
his
way
he
had
managed
to
procure
some
seeds
of
a
sort
greatly
liked
by
herons
and
these
he
scattered
before
the
beautiful
white
bird
strutting
round
the
tree
while
the
heron
was
busily
engaged
in
picking
them
up
the
young
man
seized
his
opportunity
and
gathered
quantities
of
the
chestnuts
which
were
lying
thickly
on
the
ground
ere
his
task
was
finished
however
the
heron
perceived
the
intruder
and
called
a
loud
warning
to
the
women
in
the
lodge
who
were
not
slow
to
respond
they
rushed
out
with
their
in
their
hands
and
gave
chase
to
the
thief
but
fear
for
his
brother
as
well
as
for
himself
lent
the
youth
wings
and
he
was
well
out
on
the
river
in
his
canoe
when
the
shrieking
women
reached
the
bank
the
eldest
threw
her
line
and
caught
him
but
with
a
sharp
pull
he
broke
it
another
line
met
with
the
same
fate
and
so
on
until
all
the
women
had
thrown
their
lines
they
could
do
nothing
further
and
were
obliged
to
watch
the
retreating
canoe
in
impotent
rage
at
length
the
youth
having
come
safely
through
the
perils
of
the
journey
arrived
home
with
his
precious
burden
of
chestnuts
he
found
his
brother
still
alive
but
so
weak
that
he
could
hardly
speak
a
meal
of
the
chestnuts
however
helped
to
revive
him
and
he
quickly
recovered
the
stone
giantess
in
bygone
times
it
was
customary
for
a
hunter
wife
to
accompany
her
husband
when
he
sought
the
chase
a
dutiful
wife
on
these
occasions
would
carry
home
the
game
killed
by
the
hunter
and
dress
and
cook
it
for
him
there
was
once
a
chief
among
the
iroquois
who
was
a
very
skilful
hunter
in
all
his
expeditions
his
wife
was
his
companion
and
helper
on
one
excursion
he
found
such
large
quantities
of
game
that
he
built
a
wigwam
at
the
place
and
settled
there
for
a
time
with
his
wife
and
child
one
day
he
struck
out
on
a
new
track
while
his
wife
followed
the
path
they
had
taken
on
the
previous
day
in
order
to
gather
the
game
killed
then
as
the
woman
turned
her
steps
homeward
after
a
hard
day
work
she
heard
the
sound
of
another
woman
voice
inside
the
hut
filled
with
surprise
she
entered
but
found
to
her
consternation
that
her
visitor
was
no
other
than
a
stone
giantess
to
add
to
her
alarm
she
saw
that
the
creature
had
in
her
arms
the
chief
baby
while
the
mother
stood
in
the
doorway
wondering
how
she
could
rescue
her
child
from
the
clutches
of
the
giantess
the
latter
said
in
a
gentle
and
soothing
voice
do
not
be
afraid
come
inside
the
hunter
wife
hesitated
no
longer
but
boldly
entered
the
wigwam
once
inside
her
fear
changed
to
pity
for
the
giantess
was
evidently
much
worn
with
trouble
and
fatigue
she
told
the
hunter
wife
who
was
kindly
and
sympathetic
how
she
had
travelled
from
the
land
of
the
stone
giants
fleeing
from
her
cruel
husband
who
had
sought
to
kill
her
and
how
she
had
finally
taken
shelter
in
the
solitary
wigwam
she
besought
the
young
woman
to
let
her
remain
for
a
while
promising
to
assist
her
in
her
daily
tasks
she
also
said
she
was
very
hungry
but
warned
her
hostess
that
she
must
be
exceedingly
careful
about
the
food
she
gave
her
it
must
not
be
raw
or
at
all
underdone
for
if
once
she
tasted
blood
she
might
wish
to
kill
the
hunter
and
his
wife
and
child
so
the
wife
prepared
some
food
for
her
taking
care
that
it
was
thoroughly
cooked
and
the
two
sat
down
to
dine
together
the
stone
giantess
knew
that
the
woman
was
in
the
habit
of
carrying
home
the
game
and
she
now
declared
that
she
would
do
it
in
her
stead
moreover
she
said
she
already
knew
where
it
was
to
be
found
and
insisted
on
setting
out
for
it
at
once
she
very
shortly
returned
bearing
in
one
hand
a
load
of
game
which
four
men
could
scarcely
have
carried
and
the
woman
recognized
in
her
a
very
valuable
assistant
the
time
of
the
hunter
return
drew
near
and
the
stone
giantess
bade
the
wife
go
out
and
meet
her
husband
and
tell
him
of
her
visitor
the
man
was
very
well
pleased
to
learn
how
the
had
helped
his
wife
and
he
gave
her
a
hearty
welcome
in
the
morning
he
went
out
hunting
as
usual
when
he
had
disappeared
from
sight
in
the
forest
the
giantess
turned
quickly
to
the
woman
and
said
i
have
a
secret
to
tell
you
my
cruel
husband
is
after
me
and
in
three
days
he
will
arrive
here
on
the
third
day
your
husband
must
remain
at
home
and
help
me
to
slay
him
when
the
third
day
came
round
the
hunter
remained
at
home
obedient
to
the
instructions
of
his
guest
now
said
the
giantess
at
last
i
hear
him
coming
you
must
both
help
me
to
hold
him
strike
him
where
i
bid
you
and
we
shall
certainly
kill
him
the
hunter
and
his
wife
were
seized
with
terror
when
a
great
commotion
outside
announced
the
arrival
of
the
stone
giant
but
the
firmness
and
courage
of
the
giantess
reassured
them
and
with
something
like
calmness
they
awaited
the
monster
approach
directly
he
came
in
sight
the
giantess
rushed
forward
grappled
with
him
and
threw
him
to
the
ground
strike
him
on
the
arms
she
cried
to
the
others
now
on
the
nape
of
the
neck
the
trembling
couple
obeyed
and
very
shortly
they
had
succeeded
in
killing
the
huge
creature
i
will
go
and
bury
him
said
the
giantess
and
that
was
the
end
of
the
stone
giant
the
strange
guest
stayed
on
in
the
wigwam
till
the
time
came
for
the
hunter
and
his
family
to
go
back
to
the
settlement
when
she
announced
her
intention
of
returning
to
her
own
people
my
husband
is
dead
said
she
i
have
no
longer
anything
to
fear
thus
having
bade
them
farewell
she
departed
the
healing
waters
the
iroquois
have
a
touching
story
of
how
a
brave
of
their
race
once
saved
his
wife
and
his
people
from
extinction
it
was
winter
the
snow
lay
thickly
on
the
ground
and
there
was
sorrow
in
the
encampment
for
with
the
cold
weather
a
dreadful
plague
had
visited
the
people
there
was
not
one
but
had
lost
some
relative
and
in
some
cases
whole
families
had
been
swept
away
among
those
who
had
been
most
sorely
bereaved
was
nekumonta
a
handsome
young
brave
whose
parents
brothers
sisters
and
children
had
died
one
by
one
before
his
eyes
the
while
he
was
powerless
to
help
them
and
now
his
wife
the
beautiful
shanewis
was
weak
and
ill
the
dreaded
disease
had
laid
its
awful
finger
on
her
brow
and
she
knew
that
she
must
shortly
bid
her
husband
farewell
and
take
her
departure
for
the
place
of
the
dead
already
she
saw
her
dead
friends
beckoning
to
her
and
inviting
her
to
join
them
but
it
grieved
her
terribly
to
think
that
she
must
leave
her
young
husband
in
sorrow
and
loneliness
his
despair
was
piteous
to
behold
when
she
broke
the
sad
news
to
him
but
after
the
first
outburst
of
grief
he
bore
up
bravely
and
determined
to
fight
the
plague
with
all
his
strength
i
must
find
the
healing
herbs
which
the
great
manitou
has
planted
said
he
wherever
they
may
be
i
must
find
them
so
he
made
his
wife
comfortable
on
her
couch
covering
her
with
warm
furs
and
then
embracing
her
gently
he
set
out
on
his
difficult
mission
all
day
he
sought
eagerly
in
the
forest
for
the
healing
herbs
but
everywhere
the
snow
lay
deep
and
not
so
much
as
a
blade
of
grass
was
visible
when
night
came
he
crept
along
the
frozen
ground
thinking
that
his
sense
of
smell
might
aid
him
in
his
search
thus
for
three
days
and
nights
he
wandered
through
the
forest
over
hills
and
across
rivers
in
a
vain
attempt
to
discover
the
means
of
curing
the
malady
of
shanewis
when
he
met
a
little
scurrying
rabbit
in
the
path
he
cried
eagerly
tell
me
where
shall
i
find
the
herbs
which
manitou
has
planted
but
the
rabbit
hurried
away
without
reply
for
he
knew
that
the
herbs
had
not
yet
risen
above
the
ground
and
he
was
very
sorry
for
the
brave
nekumonta
came
by
and
by
to
the
den
of
a
big
bear
and
of
this
animal
also
he
asked
the
same
question
but
the
bear
could
give
him
no
reply
and
he
was
obliged
to
resume
his
weary
journey
he
consulted
all
the
beasts
of
the
forest
in
turn
but
from
none
could
he
get
any
help
how
could
they
tell
him
indeed
that
his
search
was
hopeless
the
pity
of
the
trees
on
the
third
night
he
was
very
weak
and
ill
for
he
had
tasted
no
food
since
he
had
first
set
out
and
he
was
numbed
with
cold
and
despair
he
stumbled
over
a
withered
branch
hidden
under
the
snow
and
so
tired
was
he
that
he
lay
where
he
fell
and
immediately
went
to
sleep
all
the
birds
and
the
beasts
all
the
multitude
of
creatures
that
inhabit
the
forest
came
to
watch
over
his
slumbers
they
remembered
his
kindness
to
them
in
former
days
how
he
had
never
slain
an
animal
unless
he
really
needed
it
for
food
or
clothing
how
he
had
loved
and
protected
the
trees
and
the
flowers
their
hearts
were
touched
by
his
courageous
fight
for
shanewis
and
they
pitied
his
misfortunes
all
that
they
could
do
to
aid
him
they
did
they
cried
to
the
great
manitou
to
save
his
wife
from
the
plague
which
held
her
and
the
great
spirit
heard
the
manifold
whispering
and
responded
to
their
prayers
illustration
she
sang
a
strange
sweet
song
while
nekumonta
lay
asleep
there
came
to
him
the
messenger
of
manitou
and
he
dreamed
in
his
dream
he
saw
his
beautiful
shanewis
pale
and
thin
but
as
lovely
as
ever
and
as
he
looked
she
smiled
at
him
and
sang
a
strange
sweet
song
like
the
murmuring
of
a
distant
waterfall
then
the
scene
changed
and
it
really
was
a
waterfall
he
heard
in
musical
language
it
called
him
by
name
saying
seek
us
o
nekumonta
and
when
you
find
us
shanewis
shall
live
we
are
the
healing
waters
of
the
great
manitou
nekumonta
awoke
with
the
words
of
the
song
still
ringing
in
his
ears
starting
to
his
feet
he
looked
in
every
direction
but
there
was
no
water
to
be
seen
though
the
murmuring
sound
of
a
waterfall
was
distinctly
audible
he
fancied
he
could
even
distinguish
words
in
it
the
finding
of
the
waters
release
us
it
seemed
to
say
set
us
free
and
shanewis
shall
be
saved
nekumonta
searched
in
vain
for
the
waters
then
it
suddenly
occurred
to
him
that
they
must
be
underground
directly
under
his
feet
seizing
branches
stones
flints
he
dug
feverishly
into
the
earth
so
arduous
was
the
task
that
before
it
was
finished
he
was
completely
exhausted
but
at
last
the
hidden
spring
was
disclosed
and
the
waters
were
rippling
merrily
down
the
vale
carrying
life
and
happiness
wherever
they
went
the
young
man
bathed
his
aching
limbs
in
the
healing
stream
and
in
a
moment
he
was
well
and
strong
raising
his
hands
he
gave
thanks
to
manitou
with
eager
fingers
he
made
a
jar
of
clay
and
baked
it
in
the
fire
so
that
he
might
carry
life
to
shanewis
as
he
pursued
his
way
homeward
with
his
treasure
his
despair
was
changed
to
rejoicing
and
he
sped
like
the
wind
when
he
reached
his
village
his
companions
ran
to
greet
him
their
faces
were
sad
and
hopeless
for
the
plague
still
raged
however
nekumonta
directed
them
to
the
healing
waters
and
inspired
them
with
new
hope
shanewis
he
found
on
the
verge
of
the
and
scarcely
able
to
murmur
a
farewell
to
her
husband
but
nekumonta
did
not
listen
to
her
broken
adieux
he
forced
some
of
the
healing
water
between
her
parched
lips
and
bathed
her
hands
and
her
brow
till
she
fell
into
a
gentle
slumber
when
she
awoke
the
fever
had
left
her
she
was
serene
and
smiling
and
nekumonta
heart
was
filled
with
a
great
happiness
the
tribe
was
for
ever
rid
of
the
dreaded
plague
and
the
people
gave
to
nekumonta
the
title
of
of
the
healing
waters
so
that
all
might
know
that
it
was
he
who
had
brought
them
the
gift
of
manitou
sayadio
in
a
legend
of
the
wyandot
tribe
of
the
iroquois
relates
how
sayadio
a
young
indian
mourned
greatly
for
a
beautiful
sister
who
had
died
young
so
deeply
did
he
grieve
for
her
that
at
length
he
resolved
to
seek
her
in
the
land
of
spirits
long
he
sought
the
maiden
and
many
adventures
did
he
meet
with
years
passed
in
the
search
which
he
was
about
to
abandon
as
wholly
in
vain
when
he
encountered
an
old
man
who
gave
him
some
good
advice
this
venerable
person
also
bestowed
upon
him
a
magic
calabash
in
which
he
might
catch
and
retain
the
spirit
of
his
sister
should
he
succeed
in
finding
her
he
afterward
discovered
that
this
old
man
was
the
keeper
of
that
part
of
the
which
he
sought
delighted
to
have
achieved
so
much
sayadio
pursued
his
way
and
in
due
time
reached
the
land
of
souls
but
to
his
dismay
he
perceived
that
the
spirits
instead
of
advancing
to
meet
him
as
he
had
expected
fled
from
him
in
terror
greatly
dejected
he
approached
tarenyawago
the
spirit
master
of
ceremonies
who
took
compassion
upon
him
and
informed
him
that
the
dead
had
gathered
together
for
a
great
dance
festival
just
such
as
the
indians
themselves
celebrate
at
certain
seasons
of
the
year
soon
the
dancing
commenced
and
sayadio
saw
the
spirits
floating
round
in
a
mazy
measure
like
wreaths
of
mist
among
them
he
perceived
his
sister
and
sprang
forward
to
embrace
her
but
she
eluded
his
grasp
and
dissolved
into
air
illustration
soon
the
dancing
commenced
much
cast
down
the
youth
once
more
appealed
to
the
sympathetic
master
of
ceremonies
who
gave
him
a
magic
rattle
of
great
power
by
the
sound
of
which
he
might
bring
her
back
again
the
sounded
for
the
dance
and
the
dead
folk
thronged
into
the
circle
once
more
sayadio
saw
his
sister
and
observed
that
she
was
so
wholly
entranced
with
the
music
that
she
took
no
heed
of
his
presence
quick
as
thought
the
young
indian
dipped
up
the
ghost
with
his
calabash
as
one
nets
a
fish
and
secured
the
cover
in
spite
of
all
the
efforts
of
the
captured
soul
to
regain
its
liberty
retracing
his
steps
earthward
he
had
no
difficulty
in
making
his
way
back
to
his
native
village
where
he
summoned
his
friends
to
come
and
behold
his
resuscitation
the
girl
corpse
was
brought
from
its
to
be
reanimated
with
its
spirit
and
all
was
prepared
for
the
ceremony
when
a
witless
indian
maiden
must
needs
peep
into
the
calabash
in
her
curiosity
to
see
how
a
disembodied
spirit
looked
instantly
as
a
bird
rises
when
its
cage
bars
are
opened
and
flies
forth
to
freedom
the
spirit
of
sayadio
sister
flew
from
the
calabash
before
the
startled
youth
could
dash
forward
and
shut
down
the
cover
for
a
while
sayadio
could
not
realize
his
loss
but
at
length
his
straining
eyes
revealed
to
him
that
the
spirit
of
his
sister
was
not
within
sight
in
a
flash
he
saw
the
ruin
of
his
hopes
and
with
a
broken
heart
he
sank
senseless
to
the
earth
the
peace
queen
a
brave
of
the
oneida
tribe
of
the
iroquois
hunted
in
the
forest
the
red
buck
flashed
past
him
but
not
swifter
than
his
arrow
for
as
the
deer
leaped
he
loosed
his
shaft
and
it
pierced
the
dappled
hide
the
young
man
strode
toward
the
carcass
knife
in
hand
but
as
he
seized
the
horns
the
branches
parted
and
the
angry
face
of
an
onondaga
warrior
lowered
between
them
leave
the
buck
oneida
he
commanded
fiercely
it
is
the
spoil
of
my
bow
i
wounded
the
beast
ere
you
saw
it
the
oneida
laughed
my
brother
may
have
shot
at
the
buck
he
said
but
what
avails
that
if
he
did
not
slay
it
the
carcass
is
mine
by
right
of
forest
law
cried
the
other
in
a
rage
will
you
quit
it
or
will
you
fight
the
oneida
drew
himself
up
and
regarded
the
onondaga
scornfully
as
my
brother
pleases
he
replied
next
moment
the
two
were
locked
in
a
struggle
tall
was
the
onondaga
and
strong
as
a
great
tree
of
the
forest
the
oneida
lithe
as
a
panther
fought
with
all
the
courage
of
youth
to
and
fro
they
swayed
till
their
breathing
came
thick
and
fast
and
the
falling
sweat
blinded
their
eyes
at
length
they
could
struggle
no
longer
and
by
a
mutual
impulse
they
sprang
apart
the
quarrel
ho
onondaga
cried
the
younger
man
what
profits
it
thus
to
strive
for
a
buck
is
there
no
meat
in
the
lodges
of
your
people
that
they
must
fight
for
it
like
the
mountain
lion
peace
young
man
retorted
the
grave
onondaga
i
had
not
fought
for
the
buck
had
not
your
evil
tongue
roused
me
but
i
am
older
than
you
and
i
trust
wiser
let
us
seek
the
lodge
of
the
peace
queen
hard
by
and
she
will
award
the
buck
to
him
who
has
the
best
right
to
it
it
is
well
said
the
oneida
and
side
by
side
they
sought
the
lodge
of
the
peace
queen
now
the
five
nations
in
their
wisdom
had
set
apart
a
seneca
maiden
dwelling
alone
in
the
forest
as
arbiter
of
quarrels
between
braves
this
maiden
the
men
of
all
tribes
regarded
as
sacred
and
as
apart
from
other
women
like
the
ancient
vestals
she
could
not
become
the
bride
of
any
man
as
the
peace
queen
heard
the
wrathful
clamour
of
the
braves
outside
her
lodge
she
stepped
forth
little
pleased
that
they
should
thus
profane
the
vicinity
of
her
dwelling
peace
she
cried
if
you
have
a
grievance
enter
and
state
it
it
is
not
fitting
that
braves
should
quarrel
where
the
peace
queen
dwells
at
her
words
the
men
stood
abashed
they
entered
the
lodge
and
told
the
story
of
their
meeting
and
the
circumstances
of
their
quarrel
when
they
had
finished
the
peace
queen
smiled
scornfully
so
two
such
braves
as
you
can
quarrel
about
a
buck
she
said
go
onondaga
as
the
elder
and
take
one
half
of
the
spoil
and
bear
it
back
to
your
wife
and
children
but
the
onondaga
stood
his
ground
the
offers
o
queen
he
said
my
wife
is
in
the
land
of
spirits
snatched
from
me
by
the
plague
demon
but
my
lodge
does
not
lack
food
i
would
wive
again
and
thine
eyes
have
looked
into
my
heart
as
the
sun
pierces
the
darkness
of
the
forest
will
you
come
to
my
lodge
and
cook
my
venison
but
the
peace
queen
shook
her
head
you
know
that
the
five
nations
have
placed
genetaska
apart
to
be
peace
queen
she
replied
firmly
and
that
her
vows
may
not
be
broken
go
in
peace
the
onondaga
was
silent
then
spoke
the
oneida
o
peace
queen
he
said
gazing
steadfastly
at
genetaska
whose
eyes
dropped
before
his
glance
i
know
that
you
are
set
apart
by
the
five
nations
but
it
is
in
my
mind
to
ask
you
to
go
with
me
to
my
lodge
for
i
love
you
what
says
genetaska
the
peace
queen
blushed
and
answered
to
you
also
i
say
go
in
peace
but
her
voice
was
a
whisper
which
ended
in
a
stifled
sob
the
two
warriors
departed
good
friends
now
that
they
possessed
a
common
sorrow
but
the
peace
maiden
had
for
ever
lost
her
peace
for
she
could
not
forget
the
young
oneida
brave
so
tall
so
strong
and
so
gentle
summer
darkened
into
autumn
and
autumn
whitened
into
winter
warriors
innumerable
came
to
the
peace
lodge
for
the
settlement
of
disputes
outwardly
genetaska
was
calm
and
untroubled
but
though
she
gave
solace
to
others
her
own
breast
could
find
none
one
day
she
sat
by
the
lodge
fire
which
had
burned
down
to
a
heap
of
cinders
she
was
thinking
dreaming
of
the
young
oneida
her
thoughts
went
out
to
him
as
birds
fly
southward
to
seek
the
sun
suddenly
a
crackling
of
twigs
under
a
firm
step
roused
her
from
her
reverie
quickly
she
glanced
upward
before
her
stood
the
youth
of
her
dreams
pale
and
worn
peace
queen
he
said
sadly
you
have
brought
darkness
to
the
soul
of
the
oneida
no
longer
may
he
follow
the
hunt
the
deer
may
sport
in
quiet
for
him
no
longer
may
he
bend
the
bow
or
throw
the
tomahawk
in
contest
or
listen
to
the
tale
during
the
long
nights
round
the
you
have
his
heart
in
your
keeping
say
will
you
not
give
him
yours
softly
the
peace
queen
murmured
i
will
hand
in
hand
like
two
joyous
children
they
sought
his
canoe
which
bore
them
swiftly
westward
no
longer
was
genetaska
peace
queen
for
her
vows
were
broken
by
the
power
of
love
the
two
were
happy
but
not
so
the
men
of
the
five
nations
they
were
wroth
because
the
peace
queen
had
broken
her
vows
and
knew
how
foolish
they
had
been
to
trust
to
the
word
of
a
young
and
beautiful
woman
so
with
one
voice
they
abolished
the
office
of
peace
queen
and
war
and
tumult
returned
once
more
to
their
own
chapter
v
sioux
myths
and
legends
the
sioux
or
dakota
indians
the
sioux
or
dakota
indians
dwell
north
of
the
arkansas
river
on
the
right
bank
of
the
mississippi
stretching
over
to
lake
michigan
and
up
the
valley
of
the
missouri
one
of
their
principal
tribes
is
the
iowa
the
adventures
of
ictinike
many
tales
are
told
by
the
iowa
indians
regarding
ictinike
the
son
of
the
who
had
offended
his
father
and
was
consequently
expelled
from
the
celestial
regions
he
possesses
a
very
bad
reputation
among
the
indians
for
deceit
and
trickery
they
say
that
he
taught
them
all
the
evil
things
they
know
and
they
seem
to
regard
him
as
a
father
of
lies
the
omahas
state
that
he
gave
them
their
and
for
one
reason
or
another
they
appear
to
look
upon
him
as
a
species
of
a
series
of
myths
recount
his
adventures
with
several
inhabitants
of
the
wild
the
first
of
these
is
as
follows
one
day
ictinike
encountered
the
rabbit
and
hailed
him
in
a
friendly
manner
calling
him
and
requesting
him
to
do
him
a
service
the
rabbit
expressed
his
willingness
to
assist
the
god
to
the
best
of
his
ability
and
inquired
what
he
wished
him
to
do
oh
grandchild
said
the
crafty
one
pointing
upward
to
where
a
bird
circled
in
the
blue
vault
above
them
take
your
bow
and
arrow
and
bring
down
yonder
bird
the
rabbit
fitted
an
arrow
to
his
bow
and
the
shaft
transfixed
the
bird
which
fell
like
a
stone
and
lodged
in
the
branches
of
a
great
tree
now
grandchild
said
ictinike
go
into
the
tree
and
fetch
me
the
game
this
however
the
rabbit
at
first
refused
to
do
but
at
length
he
took
off
his
clothes
and
climbed
into
the
tree
where
he
stuck
fast
among
the
tortuous
branches
ictinike
seeing
that
he
could
not
make
his
way
down
donned
the
unfortunate
rabbit
garments
and
highly
amused
at
the
predicament
betook
himself
to
the
nearest
village
there
he
encountered
a
chief
who
had
two
beautiful
daughters
the
elder
of
whom
he
married
the
younger
daughter
regarding
this
as
an
affront
to
her
personal
attractions
wandered
off
into
the
forest
in
a
fit
of
the
sulks
as
she
paced
angrily
up
and
down
she
heard
some
one
calling
to
her
from
above
and
looking
upward
she
beheld
the
unfortunate
rabbit
whose
fur
was
adhering
to
the
natural
gum
which
exuded
from
the
bark
of
the
tree
the
girl
cut
down
the
tree
and
lit
a
fire
near
it
which
melted
the
gum
and
freed
the
rabbit
the
rabbit
and
the
daughter
compared
notes
and
discovered
that
the
being
who
had
tricked
the
one
and
affronted
the
other
was
the
same
together
they
proceeded
to
the
chief
lodge
where
the
girl
was
laughed
at
because
of
the
strange
companion
she
had
brought
back
with
her
suddenly
an
eagle
appeared
in
the
air
above
them
ictinike
shot
at
and
missed
it
but
the
rabbit
loosed
an
arrow
with
great
force
and
brought
it
to
earth
each
morning
a
feather
of
the
bird
became
another
eagle
and
each
morning
ictinike
shot
at
and
missed
this
newly
created
bird
which
the
rabbit
invariably
succeeded
in
killing
this
went
on
until
ictinike
had
quite
worn
out
the
rabbit
clothing
and
was
wearing
a
very
old
piece
of
tent
skin
but
the
rabbit
returned
to
him
the
garments
he
had
been
forced
to
don
when
ictinike
had
stolen
his
then
the
rabbit
commanded
the
indians
to
beat
the
drums
and
each
time
they
were
beaten
ictinike
jumped
so
high
that
every
bone
in
his
body
was
shaken
at
length
after
a
more
than
usually
loud
series
of
beats
he
leapt
to
such
a
height
that
when
he
came
down
it
was
found
that
the
fall
had
broken
his
neck
the
rabbit
was
avenged
illustration
he
jumped
so
high
that
every
bone
in
his
body
was
shaken
ictinike
and
the
buzzard
one
day
ictinike
footsore
and
weary
encountered
a
buzzard
which
he
asked
to
oblige
him
by
carrying
him
on
its
back
part
of
the
way
the
crafty
bird
immediately
consented
and
seating
ictinike
between
its
wings
flew
off
with
him
they
had
not
gone
far
when
they
passed
above
a
hollow
tree
and
ictinike
began
to
shift
uneasily
in
his
seat
as
he
observed
the
buzzard
hovering
over
it
he
requested
the
bird
to
fly
onward
but
for
answer
it
cast
him
headlong
into
the
where
he
found
himself
a
prisoner
for
a
long
time
he
lay
there
in
want
and
wretchedness
until
at
last
a
large
struck
camp
at
the
spot
ictinike
chanced
to
be
wearing
some
racoon
skins
and
he
thrust
the
tails
of
these
through
the
cracks
in
the
tree
three
women
who
were
standing
near
imagined
that
a
number
of
racoons
had
become
imprisoned
in
the
hollow
trunk
and
they
made
a
large
hole
in
it
for
the
purpose
of
capturing
them
ictinike
at
once
emerged
whereupon
the
women
fled
ictinike
lay
on
the
ground
pretending
to
be
dead
and
as
he
was
covered
with
the
the
birds
of
prey
the
eagle
the
rook
and
the
magpie
came
to
devour
him
while
they
pecked
at
him
the
buzzard
made
his
appearance
for
the
purpose
of
joining
in
the
feast
but
ictinike
rising
quickly
tore
the
feathers
from
its
scalp
that
is
why
the
buzzard
has
no
feathers
on
its
head
ictinike
and
the
creators
in
course
of
time
ictinike
married
and
dwelt
in
a
lodge
of
his
own
one
day
he
intimated
to
his
wife
that
it
was
his
intention
to
visit
her
grandfather
the
beaver
on
arriving
at
the
beaver
lodge
he
found
that
his
and
his
family
had
been
without
food
for
a
long
time
and
were
slowly
dying
of
starvation
ashamed
at
having
no
food
to
place
before
their
guest
one
of
the
young
beavers
offered
himself
up
to
provide
a
meal
for
ictinike
and
was
duly
cooked
and
served
to
the
visitor
before
ictinike
partook
of
the
dish
however
he
was
earnestly
requested
by
the
beaver
not
to
break
any
of
the
bones
of
his
son
but
unwittingly
he
split
one
of
the
having
finished
his
repast
he
lay
down
to
rest
and
the
beaver
gathered
the
bones
and
put
them
in
a
skin
this
he
plunged
into
the
river
that
flowed
beside
his
lodge
and
in
a
moment
the
young
beaver
emerged
from
the
water
alive
how
do
you
feel
my
son
asked
the
beaver
alas
father
replied
the
young
beaver
one
of
my
toes
is
broken
from
that
time
every
beaver
has
had
one
toe
that
next
to
the
little
one
which
looks
as
if
it
had
been
split
by
biting
ictinike
shortly
after
took
his
leave
of
the
beavers
and
pretended
to
forget
his
which
he
left
behind
the
beaver
told
one
of
his
young
ones
to
run
after
him
with
the
pouch
but
being
aware
of
ictinike
treacherous
character
he
advised
his
offspring
to
throw
it
to
the
god
when
at
some
distance
away
the
young
beaver
accordingly
took
the
pouch
and
hurried
after
ictinike
and
obeying
his
instruction
was
about
to
throw
it
to
him
from
a
considerable
distance
when
ictinike
called
to
him
come
closer
come
closer
the
young
beaver
obeyed
and
as
ictinike
took
the
pouch
from
him
he
said
tell
your
father
that
he
must
visit
me
when
the
young
beaver
arrived
home
he
acquainted
his
father
with
what
had
passed
and
the
beaver
showed
signs
of
great
annoyance
i
knew
he
would
say
that
he
growled
and
that
is
why
i
did
not
want
you
to
go
near
him
but
the
beaver
could
not
refuse
the
invitation
and
in
due
course
returned
the
visit
ictinike
wishing
to
pay
him
a
compliment
was
about
to
kill
one
of
his
own
children
wherewith
to
regale
the
beaver
and
was
slapping
it
to
make
it
cry
in
order
that
he
might
work
himself
into
a
passion
sufficiently
murderous
to
enable
him
to
take
its
life
when
the
beaver
spoke
to
him
sharply
and
told
him
that
such
a
sacrifice
was
unnecessary
going
down
to
the
stream
hard
by
the
beaver
found
a
young
beaver
by
the
water
which
was
brought
up
to
the
lodge
killed
and
cooked
and
duly
eaten
on
another
occasion
ictinike
announced
to
his
wife
his
intention
of
calling
upon
her
grandfather
the
at
the
lodge
he
met
with
the
same
tale
of
starvation
as
at
the
home
of
the
beaver
but
the
told
his
wife
to
fetch
some
water
put
it
in
the
kettle
and
hang
the
kettle
over
the
fire
when
the
water
was
boiling
the
upset
the
kettle
which
was
found
to
be
full
of
wild
rice
upon
which
ictinike
feasted
as
before
he
left
his
with
his
host
and
the
sent
one
of
his
children
after
him
with
the
article
an
invitation
for
the
to
visit
him
resulted
and
the
call
was
duly
paid
ictinike
wishing
to
display
his
magical
powers
requested
his
wife
to
hang
a
kettle
of
water
over
the
fire
but
to
his
chagrin
when
the
water
was
boiled
and
the
kettle
upset
instead
of
wild
rice
only
water
poured
out
thereupon
the
had
the
kettle
refilled
and
produced
an
abundance
of
rice
much
to
ictinike
annoyance
ictinike
then
called
upon
his
wife
grandfather
the
kingfisher
who
to
provide
him
with
food
dived
into
the
river
and
brought
up
fish
ictinike
extended
a
similar
invitation
to
him
and
the
visit
was
duly
paid
desiring
to
be
even
with
his
late
host
the
god
dived
into
the
river
in
search
of
fish
he
soon
found
himself
in
difficulties
however
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
kingfisher
he
would
most
assuredly
have
been
drowned
lastly
ictinike
went
to
visit
his
wife
grandfather
the
flying
squirrel
the
squirrel
climbed
to
the
top
of
his
lodge
and
brought
down
a
quantity
of
excellent
black
walnuts
which
ictinike
ate
when
he
departed
from
the
squirrel
house
he
purposely
left
one
of
his
gloves
which
a
small
squirrel
brought
after
him
and
he
sent
an
invitation
by
this
messenger
for
the
squirrel
to
visit
him
in
turn
wishing
to
show
his
cleverness
ictinike
scrambled
to
the
top
of
his
lodge
but
instead
of
finding
any
black
walnuts
there
he
fell
and
severely
injured
himself
thus
his
presumption
was
punished
for
the
fourth
time
the
four
beings
alluded
to
in
this
story
as
the
beaver
kingfisher
and
flying
squirrel
are
four
of
the
creative
gods
of
the
sioux
whom
ictinike
evidently
could
not
equal
so
far
as
reproductive
magic
was
concerned
the
story
of
wabaskaha
an
interesting
story
is
that
of
wabaskaha
an
omaha
brave
the
facts
related
in
which
occurred
about
a
century
ago
a
party
of
pawnees
on
the
raided
the
horses
belonging
to
some
omahas
dwelling
beside
omaha
creek
most
of
the
animals
were
the
property
of
wabaskaha
who
immediately
followed
on
their
trail
a
few
omahas
who
had
tried
to
rescue
the
horses
had
also
been
carried
off
and
on
the
arrival
of
the
pawnee
party
at
the
republican
river
several
of
the
pawnees
proposed
to
put
their
prisoners
to
death
others
however
refused
to
participate
in
such
an
act
and
strenuously
opposed
the
suggestion
a
wife
of
one
of
the
pawnee
chiefs
fed
the
captives
after
which
her
husband
gave
them
permission
to
depart
after
this
incident
quite
a
feeling
of
friendship
sprang
up
between
the
two
peoples
and
the
pawnees
were
continually
inviting
the
omahas
to
feasts
and
other
entertainments
but
they
refused
to
return
the
horses
they
had
stolen
they
told
wabaskaha
that
if
he
came
for
his
horses
in
the
fall
they
would
exchange
them
then
for
a
certain
amount
of
gunpowder
and
that
was
the
best
arrangement
he
could
come
to
with
them
on
his
way
homeward
wabaskaha
mourned
loudly
for
the
horses
which
constituted
nearly
the
whole
of
his
worldly
possessions
and
called
upon
wakanda
his
god
to
assist
and
avenge
him
in
glowing
language
he
recounted
the
circumstances
of
his
loss
to
the
people
of
his
tribe
and
so
strong
was
their
sense
of
the
injustice
done
him
that
next
day
a
general
meeting
was
held
in
the
village
to
consider
his
case
a
pipe
was
filled
and
wabaskaha
asked
the
men
of
his
tribe
to
place
it
to
their
lips
if
they
decided
to
take
vengeance
on
the
pawnees
all
did
so
but
the
premeditated
raid
was
postponed
until
the
early
autumn
after
a
summer
of
hunting
the
braves
sought
the
they
had
hardly
started
when
a
number
of
dakotas
arrived
at
their
village
bringing
some
tobacco
the
dakotas
announced
their
intention
of
joining
the
omaha
the
trail
of
which
they
took
up
accordingly
in
a
few
days
the
omahas
arrived
at
the
pawnee
village
which
they
attacked
at
daylight
after
a
vigorous
defence
the
pawnees
were
almost
exterminated
and
all
their
horses
captured
the
dakotas
who
had
elected
to
assist
the
omaha
were
however
slain
to
a
man
such
was
the
vengeance
of
wabaskaha
this
story
is
interesting
as
an
account
of
a
veritable
indian
raid
taken
from
the
lips
of
joseph
la
flèche
a
dakota
indian
the
twenty
warriors
who
had
been
on
the
were
returning
homeward
and
hungry
and
as
they
went
they
scattered
in
search
of
game
to
sustain
them
on
their
way
suddenly
one
of
the
braves
placing
his
ear
to
the
ground
declared
that
he
could
hear
a
herd
of
buffaloes
approaching
the
band
was
greatly
cheered
by
this
news
and
the
plans
made
by
the
chief
to
intercept
the
animals
were
quickly
carried
into
effect
illustration
the
kills
the
monster
rattlesnake
nearer
and
nearer
came
the
supposed
herd
the
chief
lay
very
still
ready
to
shoot
when
it
came
within
range
suddenly
he
saw
to
his
horror
that
what
approached
them
was
a
huge
snake
with
a
rattle
as
large
as
a
man
head
though
almost
paralysed
with
surprise
and
terror
he
managed
to
shoot
the
monster
and
kill
it
he
called
up
his
men
who
were
not
a
little
afraid
of
the
gigantic
creature
even
though
it
was
dead
and
for
a
long
time
they
debated
what
they
should
do
with
the
carcass
at
length
hunger
conquered
their
scruples
and
made
them
decide
to
cook
and
eat
it
to
their
surprise
they
found
the
meat
as
savoury
as
that
of
a
buffalo
which
it
much
resembled
all
partook
of
the
fare
with
the
exception
of
one
boy
who
persisted
in
refusing
it
though
they
pressed
him
to
eat
when
the
warriors
had
finished
their
meal
they
lay
down
beside
the
and
fell
asleep
later
in
the
night
the
chief
awoke
and
was
horrified
to
find
that
his
companions
had
turned
to
snakes
and
that
he
himself
was
already
half
snake
half
man
hastily
he
gathered
his
transformed
warriors
and
they
saw
that
the
boy
who
had
not
eaten
of
the
reptile
had
retained
his
own
form
the
lad
fearing
that
the
serpents
might
attack
him
began
to
weep
but
the
treated
him
very
kindly
giving
him
their
charms
and
all
they
possessed
at
their
request
he
put
them
into
a
large
robe
and
carried
them
to
the
summit
of
a
high
hill
where
he
set
them
down
under
the
trees
you
must
return
to
our
lodges
they
told
him
and
in
the
summer
we
will
visit
our
kindred
see
that
our
wives
and
children
come
out
to
greet
us
the
boy
carried
the
news
to
his
village
and
there
was
much
weeping
and
lamentation
when
the
friends
of
the
warriors
heard
of
their
fate
but
in
the
summer
the
snakes
came
and
sat
in
a
group
outside
the
village
and
all
the
people
crowded
round
them
loudly
venting
their
grief
the
horses
which
had
belonged
to
the
snakes
were
brought
out
to
them
as
well
as
their
moccasins
leggings
whips
and
saddles
do
not
be
afraid
of
them
said
the
boy
to
the
assembled
people
do
not
flee
from
them
lest
something
happen
to
you
also
so
they
let
the
snakes
creep
over
them
and
no
harm
befell
in
the
winter
the
snakes
vanished
altogether
and
with
them
their
horses
and
other
possessions
and
the
people
never
saw
them
more
the
three
tests
there
dwelt
in
a
certain
village
a
woman
of
remarkable
grace
and
attractiveness
the
fame
of
her
beauty
drew
suitors
from
far
and
near
eager
to
display
their
prowess
and
win
the
love
of
this
imperious
creature
for
besides
being
beautiful
she
was
extremely
hard
to
please
and
set
such
tests
for
her
lovers
as
none
had
ever
been
able
to
satisfy
a
certain
young
man
who
lived
at
a
considerable
distance
had
heard
of
her
great
charms
and
made
up
his
mind
to
woo
and
win
her
the
difficulty
of
the
task
did
not
daunt
him
and
full
of
hope
he
set
out
on
his
mission
as
he
travelled
he
came
to
a
very
high
hill
and
on
the
summit
he
saw
a
man
rising
and
sitting
down
at
short
intervals
when
the
prospective
suitor
drew
nearer
he
observed
that
the
man
was
fastening
large
stones
to
his
ankles
the
youth
approached
him
saying
why
do
you
tie
these
great
stones
to
your
ankles
oh
replied
the
other
i
wish
to
chase
buffaloes
and
yet
whenever
i
do
so
i
go
beyond
them
so
i
am
tying
stones
to
my
ankles
that
i
may
not
run
so
fast
my
friend
said
the
suitor
you
can
run
some
other
time
in
the
meantime
i
am
without
a
companion
come
with
me
the
swift
one
agreed
and
they
walked
on
their
way
together
ere
they
had
gone
very
far
they
saw
two
large
lakes
by
the
side
of
one
of
them
sat
a
man
who
frequently
bowed
his
head
to
the
water
and
drank
surprised
that
his
thirst
was
not
quenched
they
said
to
him
why
do
you
sit
there
drinking
of
the
lake
i
can
never
get
enough
water
when
i
have
finished
this
lake
i
shall
start
on
the
other
my
friend
said
the
suitor
do
not
trouble
to
drink
it
just
now
come
and
join
us
the
thirsty
one
complied
and
the
three
comrades
journeyed
on
when
they
had
gone
a
little
farther
they
noticed
a
man
walking
along
with
his
face
lifted
to
the
sky
curious
to
know
why
he
acted
thus
they
addressed
him
why
do
you
walk
with
your
eyes
turned
skyward
said
they
i
have
shot
an
arrow
he
said
and
i
am
waiting
for
it
to
reappear
never
mind
your
arrow
said
the
suitor
come
with
us
i
will
come
said
the
skilful
archer
as
the
four
companions
journeyed
through
a
forest
they
beheld
a
strange
sight
a
man
was
lying
with
his
ear
to
the
ground
and
if
he
lifted
his
head
for
a
moment
he
bowed
it
again
listening
intently
the
four
approached
him
saying
friend
for
what
do
you
listen
so
earnestly
i
am
listening
said
he
to
the
plants
growing
this
forest
is
full
of
plants
and
i
am
listening
to
their
breathing
you
can
listen
when
the
occasion
arises
they
told
him
come
and
join
us
he
agreed
and
so
they
travelled
to
the
village
where
dwelt
the
beautiful
maiden
when
they
had
reached
their
destination
they
were
quickly
surrounded
by
the
villagers
who
displayed
no
small
curiosity
as
to
who
their
visitors
were
and
what
object
they
had
in
coming
so
far
when
they
heard
that
one
of
the
strangers
desired
to
marry
the
village
beauty
they
shook
their
heads
over
him
did
he
not
know
the
difficulties
in
the
way
finding
that
he
would
not
be
turned
from
his
purpose
they
led
him
to
a
huge
rock
which
overshadowed
the
village
and
described
the
first
test
he
would
be
required
to
meet
if
you
wish
to
win
the
maiden
they
said
you
must
first
of
all
push
away
that
great
stone
it
is
keeping
the
sunlight
from
us
alas
said
the
youth
it
is
impossible
not
so
said
his
companion
of
the
swift
foot
nothing
could
be
more
easy
illustration
he
leaned
his
shoulder
against
the
rock
saying
this
he
leaned
his
shoulder
against
the
rock
and
with
a
mighty
crash
it
fell
from
its
place
from
the
breaking
up
of
it
came
the
rocks
and
stones
that
are
scattered
over
all
the
world
the
second
test
was
of
a
different
nature
the
people
brought
the
strangers
a
large
quantity
of
food
and
water
and
bade
them
eat
and
drink
being
very
hungry
they
succeeded
in
disposing
of
the
food
but
the
suitor
sorrowfully
regarded
the
great
kettles
of
water
alas
said
he
who
can
drink
up
that
i
can
said
the
thirsty
one
and
in
a
twinkling
he
had
drunk
it
all
the
people
were
amazed
at
the
prowess
of
the
visitors
however
they
said
there
is
still
another
test
and
they
brought
out
a
woman
who
was
a
very
swift
runner
so
swift
that
no
one
had
ever
outstripped
her
in
a
race
the
race
you
must
run
a
race
with
this
woman
said
they
if
you
win
you
shall
have
the
hand
of
the
maiden
you
have
come
to
seek
naturally
the
suitor
chose
the
swift
one
for
this
test
when
the
runners
were
started
the
people
hailed
them
as
fairly
matched
for
they
raced
together
till
they
were
out
of
sight
when
they
reached
the
the
woman
said
come
let
us
rest
for
a
little
the
man
agreed
but
no
sooner
had
he
sat
down
than
he
fell
asleep
the
woman
seized
her
opportunity
making
sure
that
her
rival
was
sleeping
soundly
she
set
off
for
the
village
running
as
hard
as
she
could
meanwhile
the
four
comrades
were
anxiously
awaiting
the
return
of
the
competitors
and
great
was
their
disappointment
when
the
woman
came
in
sight
while
there
was
yet
no
sign
of
their
champion
the
man
who
could
hear
the
plants
growing
bent
his
ear
to
the
ground
he
is
asleep
said
he
i
can
hear
him
snoring
the
skilful
archer
came
forward
and
as
he
bit
the
point
off
an
arrow
he
said
i
will
soon
wake
him
he
shot
an
arrow
from
the
bowstring
with
such
a
wonderful
aim
that
it
wounded
the
sleeper
nose
and
roused
him
from
his
slumbers
the
runner
started
to
his
feet
and
looked
round
for
the
woman
she
was
gone
knowing
that
he
had
been
tricked
the
swift
one
put
all
his
energy
into
an
effort
to
overtake
her
she
was
within
a
few
yards
of
the
when
he
passed
her
it
was
a
narrow
margin
but
nevertheless
the
swift
one
had
gained
the
race
for
his
comrade
the
youth
was
then
married
to
the
damsel
whom
he
found
to
be
all
that
her
admirers
had
claimed
and
more
the
one
day
a
young
brave
feeling
at
variance
with
the
world
in
general
and
wishing
to
rid
himself
of
the
mood
left
the
lodges
of
his
people
and
journeyed
into
the
forest
by
and
by
he
came
to
an
open
space
in
the
centre
of
which
was
a
high
hill
thinking
he
would
climb
to
the
top
and
reconnoitre
he
directed
his
footsteps
thither
and
as
he
went
he
observed
a
man
coming
in
the
opposite
direction
and
making
for
the
same
spot
the
two
met
on
the
summit
and
stood
for
a
few
moments
silently
regarding
each
other
the
stranger
was
the
first
to
speak
gravely
inviting
the
young
brave
to
accompany
him
to
his
lodge
and
sup
with
him
the
other
accepted
the
invitation
and
they
proceeded
in
the
direction
the
stranger
indicated
on
approaching
the
lodge
the
youth
saw
with
some
surprise
that
there
was
a
large
heap
of
bones
in
front
of
the
door
within
sat
a
very
old
woman
tending
a
pot
when
the
young
man
learned
that
the
feast
was
to
be
a
cannibal
one
however
he
declined
to
partake
of
it
the
woman
thereupon
boiled
some
corn
for
him
and
while
doing
so
told
him
that
his
host
was
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
a
sort
of
ogre
who
killed
and
ate
human
beings
because
the
brave
was
young
and
very
handsome
the
old
woman
took
pity
on
him
bemoaning
the
fate
that
would
surely
befall
him
unless
he
could
escape
from
the
wiles
of
the
listen
said
she
i
will
tell
you
what
to
do
here
are
some
moccasins
when
the
morning
comes
put
them
on
your
feet
take
one
step
and
you
will
find
yourself
on
that
headland
you
see
in
the
distance
give
this
paper
to
the
man
you
will
meet
there
and
he
will
direct
you
further
but
remember
that
however
far
you
may
go
in
the
evening
the
snake
will
overtake
you
when
you
have
finished
with
the
moccasins
take
them
off
place
them
on
the
ground
facing
this
way
and
they
will
return
is
that
all
said
the
youth
no
she
replied
before
you
go
you
must
kill
me
and
put
a
robe
over
my
bones
the
magic
moccasins
the
young
brave
forthwith
proceeded
to
carry
these
instructions
into
effect
first
of
all
he
killed
the
old
woman
and
disposed
of
her
remains
in
accordance
with
her
bidding
in
the
morning
he
put
on
the
magic
moccasins
which
she
had
provided
for
him
and
with
one
great
step
he
reached
the
distant
headland
here
he
met
an
old
man
who
received
the
paper
from
him
and
then
giving
him
another
pair
of
moccasins
directed
him
to
a
point
where
he
was
to
deliver
another
piece
of
paper
to
a
man
who
would
await
him
there
turning
the
first
moccasins
homeward
the
young
brave
put
the
second
pair
to
use
and
took
another
gigantic
step
arrived
at
the
second
stage
of
his
journey
from
the
snake
lodge
he
found
it
a
repetition
of
the
first
he
was
directed
to
another
distant
spot
and
from
that
to
yet
another
but
when
he
delivered
his
message
for
the
fourth
time
he
was
treated
somewhat
differently
illustration
with
one
great
step
he
reached
the
distant
headland
down
there
in
the
hollow
said
the
recipient
of
the
paper
there
is
a
stream
go
toward
it
and
walk
straight
on
but
do
not
look
at
the
water
the
youth
did
as
he
was
bidden
and
shortly
found
himself
on
the
opposite
bank
of
the
stream
he
journeyed
up
the
creek
and
as
evening
fell
he
came
upon
a
place
where
the
river
widened
to
a
lake
skirting
its
shores
he
suddenly
found
himself
face
to
face
with
the
snake
only
then
did
he
remember
the
words
of
the
old
woman
who
had
warned
him
that
in
the
evening
the
snake
would
overtake
him
so
he
turned
himself
into
a
little
fish
with
red
fins
lazily
moving
in
the
lake
the
snake
quest
the
snake
high
on
the
bank
saw
the
little
creature
and
cried
little
fish
have
you
seen
the
person
i
am
looking
for
if
a
bird
had
flown
over
the
lake
you
must
have
seen
it
the
water
is
so
still
and
surely
you
have
seen
the
man
i
am
seeking
not
so
replied
the
little
fish
i
have
seen
no
one
but
if
he
passes
this
way
i
will
tell
you
so
the
snake
continued
and
as
he
went
there
was
a
little
grey
toad
right
in
his
path
little
toad
said
he
have
you
seen
him
for
whom
i
am
seeking
even
if
only
a
shadow
were
here
you
must
have
seen
it
yes
said
the
little
toad
i
have
seen
him
but
i
can
not
tell
you
which
way
he
has
gone
the
snake
doubled
and
came
back
on
his
trail
seeing
a
very
large
fish
in
shallow
water
he
said
have
you
seen
the
man
i
am
looking
for
that
is
he
with
whom
you
have
just
been
talking
said
the
fish
and
the
snake
turned
homeward
meeting
a
he
stopped
have
you
seen
the
person
i
am
looking
for
he
said
then
having
his
suspicions
aroused
he
added
craftily
i
think
that
you
are
he
but
the
began
a
bitter
complaint
just
now
said
he
the
person
you
seek
passed
over
my
lodge
and
broke
it
so
the
snake
passed
on
and
encountered
a
turtle
he
repeated
his
query
and
the
turtle
told
him
that
the
object
of
his
search
was
to
be
met
with
farther
on
but
beware
he
added
for
if
you
do
not
recognize
him
he
will
kill
you
following
the
stream
the
snake
came
upon
a
large
green
frog
floating
in
shallow
water
i
have
been
seeking
a
person
since
morning
he
said
i
think
that
you
are
he
the
frog
allayed
his
suspicions
saying
you
will
meet
him
farther
down
the
stream
the
snake
next
found
a
large
turtle
floating
among
the
green
scum
on
a
lake
getting
on
the
turtle
back
he
said
you
must
be
the
person
i
seek
and
his
head
rose
higher
and
higher
as
he
prepared
to
strike
i
am
not
replied
the
turtle
the
next
person
you
meet
will
be
he
but
beware
for
if
you
do
not
recognize
him
he
will
kill
you
when
he
had
gone
a
little
farther
down
the
snake
attempted
to
cross
the
stream
in
the
middle
was
an
eddy
crafty
as
he
was
the
snake
failed
to
recognize
his
enemy
and
the
eddy
drew
him
down
into
the
water
and
drowned
him
so
the
youth
succeeded
in
slaying
the
snake
who
had
sought
throughout
the
day
to
kill
him
the
story
of
the
salmon
a
certain
chief
who
had
a
very
beautiful
daughter
was
unwilling
to
part
with
her
but
knowing
that
the
time
must
come
when
she
would
marry
he
arranged
a
contest
for
her
suitors
in
which
the
feat
was
to
break
a
pair
of
elk
antlers
hung
in
the
centre
of
the
lodge
whoever
shall
break
these
antlers
the
old
chief
declared
shall
have
the
hand
of
my
daughter
the
quadrupeds
came
first
the
snail
squirrel
otter
beaver
wolf
bear
and
panther
but
all
their
strength
and
skill
would
not
suffice
to
break
the
antlers
next
came
the
birds
but
their
efforts
also
were
unavailing
the
only
creature
left
who
had
not
attempted
the
feat
was
a
feeble
thing
covered
with
sores
whom
the
mischievous
blue
jay
derisively
summoned
to
perform
the
task
after
repeated
taunts
from
the
tricky
bird
the
creature
rose
shook
itself
and
became
whole
and
clean
and
very
good
to
look
upon
and
the
assembled
company
saw
that
it
was
the
salmon
he
grasped
the
elk
antlers
and
easily
broke
them
in
five
pieces
then
claiming
his
prize
the
chief
daughter
he
led
her
away
before
they
had
gone
very
far
the
people
said
let
us
go
and
take
the
chief
daughter
back
and
they
set
off
in
pursuit
of
the
pair
along
the
when
salmon
saw
what
was
happening
he
created
a
bay
between
himself
and
his
pursuers
the
people
at
length
reached
the
point
of
the
bay
on
which
salmon
stood
but
he
made
another
bay
and
when
they
looked
they
could
see
him
on
the
point
of
that
one
so
the
chase
went
on
till
salmon
grew
tired
of
exercising
his
magic
powers
coyote
and
badger
who
were
in
advance
of
the
others
decided
to
shoot
at
salmon
the
arrow
hit
him
in
the
neck
and
killed
him
instantly
when
the
rest
of
the
band
came
up
they
gave
the
chief
daughter
to
the
wolves
and
she
became
the
wife
of
one
of
them
in
due
time
the
people
returned
to
their
village
and
the
crow
who
was
salmon
aunt
learnt
of
his
death
she
hastened
away
to
the
spot
where
he
had
been
killed
to
seek
for
his
remains
but
all
she
could
find
was
one
salmon
egg
which
she
hid
in
a
hole
in
the
next
day
she
found
that
the
egg
was
much
larger
on
the
third
day
it
was
a
small
trout
and
so
it
grew
till
it
became
a
salmon
and
at
length
a
handsome
youth
salmon
magic
bath
leading
young
salmon
to
a
mountain
pool
his
said
bathe
there
that
you
may
see
spirits
one
day
salmon
said
i
am
tired
of
seeing
spirits
let
me
go
away
the
old
crow
thereupon
told
him
of
his
father
death
at
the
hands
of
badger
and
coyote
they
have
taken
your
father
bow
she
said
the
salmon
shot
an
arrow
toward
the
forest
and
the
forest
went
on
fire
he
shot
an
arrow
toward
the
prairie
and
it
also
caught
fire
truly
muttered
the
old
crow
you
have
seen
spirits
having
made
up
his
mind
to
get
his
father
bow
salmon
journeyed
to
the
lodge
where
coyote
and
badger
dwelt
he
found
the
door
shut
and
the
creatures
with
their
faces
blackened
pretending
to
lament
the
death
of
old
salmon
however
he
was
not
deceived
by
their
tricks
but
boldly
entered
and
demanded
his
father
bow
four
times
they
gave
him
other
bows
which
broke
when
he
drew
them
the
fifth
time
it
was
really
his
father
bow
he
received
taking
coyote
and
badger
outside
he
knocked
them
together
and
killed
them
the
wolf
lodge
as
he
travelled
across
the
prairie
he
stumbled
on
the
habitation
of
the
wolves
and
on
entering
the
lodge
he
encountered
his
father
wife
who
bade
him
hide
before
the
monsters
returned
by
means
of
strategy
he
got
the
better
of
them
shot
them
all
and
sailed
away
in
a
little
boat
with
the
woman
here
he
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
and
slept
so
long
that
at
last
his
companion
ventured
to
wake
him
very
angry
at
being
roused
he
turned
her
into
a
pigeon
and
cast
her
out
of
the
boat
while
he
himself
as
a
salmon
swam
to
the
shore
near
the
edge
of
the
water
was
a
lodge
where
dwelt
five
beautiful
sisters
salmon
sat
on
the
shore
at
a
little
distance
and
took
the
form
of
an
aged
man
covered
with
sores
when
the
eldest
sister
came
down
to
speak
to
him
he
bade
her
carry
him
on
her
back
to
the
lodge
but
so
loathsome
a
creature
was
he
that
she
beat
a
hasty
retreat
the
second
sister
did
likewise
and
the
third
and
the
fourth
but
the
youngest
sister
proceeded
to
carry
him
to
the
lodge
where
he
became
again
a
young
and
handsome
brave
he
married
all
the
sisters
but
the
youngest
was
his
and
his
favourite
the
drowned
child
on
the
banks
of
a
river
there
dwelt
a
worthy
couple
with
their
only
son
a
little
child
whom
they
loved
dearly
one
day
the
boy
wandered
away
from
the
lodge
and
fell
into
the
water
and
no
one
was
near
enough
to
rescue
him
great
was
the
distress
of
the
parents
when
the
news
reached
them
and
all
his
kindred
were
loud
in
their
lamentations
for
the
child
had
been
a
favourite
with
everybody
the
father
especially
showed
signs
of
the
deepest
grief
and
refused
to
enter
his
lodge
till
he
should
recover
the
boy
all
night
he
lay
outside
on
the
bare
ground
his
cheek
pillowed
on
his
hand
suddenly
he
heard
a
faint
sound
far
under
the
earth
he
listened
intently
it
was
the
crying
of
his
lost
child
hastily
he
gathered
all
his
relatives
round
him
told
them
what
he
had
heard
and
besought
them
piteously
to
dig
into
the
earth
and
bring
back
his
son
this
task
they
hesitated
to
undertake
but
they
willingly
collected
horses
and
goods
in
abundance
to
be
given
to
any
one
who
would
venture
two
men
came
forward
who
claimed
to
possess
supernatural
powers
and
to
them
was
entrusted
the
work
of
finding
the
child
the
grateful
father
gave
them
a
pipe
filled
with
tobacco
and
promised
them
all
his
possessions
if
their
mission
should
succeed
the
two
gifted
men
painted
their
bodies
one
making
himself
quite
black
the
other
yellow
going
to
the
neighbouring
river
they
plunged
into
its
depths
and
so
arrived
at
the
abode
of
the
this
being
and
his
wife
having
no
children
of
their
own
had
adopted
the
indian
little
son
who
was
supposed
to
have
been
drowned
and
the
two
men
seeing
him
alive
and
well
were
pleased
to
think
that
their
task
was
as
good
as
accomplished
illustration
they
arrived
at
the
abode
of
the
the
father
has
sent
for
his
son
they
said
he
has
commanded
us
to
bring
him
back
we
dare
not
return
without
him
you
are
too
late
responded
the
had
you
come
before
he
had
eaten
of
my
food
he
might
safely
have
returned
with
you
but
he
wished
to
eat
and
he
has
eaten
and
now
alas
he
would
die
if
he
were
taken
out
of
the
water
see
the
soul
journey
sorrowfully
the
men
rose
to
the
surface
and
carried
the
tidings
to
the
father
alas
they
said
he
has
eaten
in
the
palace
of
the
he
will
die
if
we
bring
him
home
nevertheless
the
father
persisted
in
his
desire
to
see
the
child
i
must
see
him
he
said
and
the
two
men
prepared
for
a
second
journey
saying
if
you
get
him
back
the
will
require
a
white
dog
in
payment
the
indian
promised
to
supply
the
dog
the
two
men
painted
themselves
again
the
one
black
the
other
yellow
once
more
they
dived
through
the
limpid
water
to
the
palace
of
the
god
the
father
must
have
his
child
they
said
this
time
we
dare
not
return
without
him
so
the
deity
gave
up
the
little
boy
who
was
placed
in
his
arms
dead
at
the
sight
the
grief
of
his
kindred
burst
out
afresh
however
they
did
not
omit
to
cast
a
white
dog
into
the
river
nor
to
pay
the
men
lavishly
as
they
had
promised
later
the
parents
lost
a
daughter
in
the
same
manner
but
as
she
had
eaten
nothing
of
the
food
offered
her
under
the
water
she
was
brought
back
alive
on
payment
by
her
relatives
of
a
tribute
to
the
of
four
dogs
the
a
certain
chief
advised
his
son
to
travel
idling
he
pointed
out
was
not
the
way
to
qualify
for
chieftainship
when
i
was
your
age
said
he
i
did
not
sit
still
there
was
hard
work
to
be
done
and
now
look
at
me
i
have
become
a
great
chief
i
will
go
hunting
father
said
the
youth
so
his
father
furnished
him
with
good
clothing
and
had
a
horse
saddled
for
him
the
young
man
went
off
on
his
expedition
and
by
and
by
fell
in
with
some
elk
shooting
at
the
largest
beast
he
wounded
it
but
slightly
and
as
it
dashed
away
he
spurred
his
horse
after
it
in
this
manner
they
covered
a
considerable
distance
till
at
length
the
hunter
worn
out
with
thirst
and
fatigue
reined
in
his
steed
and
dismounted
he
wandered
about
in
search
of
water
till
he
was
spent
but
after
a
time
he
came
upon
a
spring
and
immediately
improvised
a
song
of
thanksgiving
to
the
deity
wakanda
who
had
permitted
him
to
find
it
his
rejoicing
was
somewhat
premature
however
for
when
he
approached
the
spring
a
snake
started
up
from
it
the
youth
was
badly
scared
and
retreated
to
a
safe
distance
without
drinking
it
seemed
as
though
he
must
die
of
thirst
after
all
venturing
to
look
back
after
a
time
he
saw
that
the
snake
had
disappeared
and
very
cautiously
he
returned
again
the
snake
darted
from
the
water
and
the
thirsty
hunter
was
forced
to
flee
a
third
return
to
the
spring
had
no
happier
results
but
when
his
thirst
drove
him
to
a
fourth
attempt
the
youth
found
instead
of
a
snake
a
very
beautiful
woman
she
offered
him
a
drink
in
a
small
cup
which
she
replenished
as
often
as
he
emptied
it
so
struck
was
he
by
her
grace
and
beauty
that
he
promptly
fell
in
love
with
her
when
it
was
time
for
him
to
return
home
she
gave
him
a
ring
saying
when
you
sit
down
to
eat
place
this
ring
on
a
seat
and
say
let
us
eat
and
i
will
come
to
you
having
bidden
her
farewell
the
young
man
turned
his
steps
homeward
and
when
he
was
once
more
among
his
kindred
he
asked
that
food
might
be
placed
before
him
make
haste
said
he
for
i
am
very
hungry
quickly
they
obeyed
him
and
set
down
a
variety
of
dishes
when
he
was
alone
the
youth
drew
the
ring
from
his
finger
and
laid
it
on
a
seat
come
he
said
let
us
eat
immediately
the
appeared
and
joined
him
at
his
meal
when
she
had
eaten
she
vanished
as
mysteriously
as
she
had
come
and
the
disconsolate
husband
for
the
youth
had
married
her
went
out
of
the
lodge
to
seek
her
thinking
she
might
be
among
the
women
of
the
village
he
said
to
his
father
let
the
women
dance
before
me
an
old
man
was
deputed
to
gather
the
women
together
but
not
one
of
them
so
much
as
resembled
the
again
the
youth
sat
down
to
eat
and
repeated
the
formula
which
his
wife
had
described
to
him
she
ate
with
him
as
before
and
vanished
when
the
meal
was
over
father
said
the
young
man
let
the
very
young
women
dance
before
me
but
the
was
not
found
among
them
either
another
fleeting
visit
from
his
wife
induced
the
chief
son
to
make
yet
another
attempt
to
find
her
in
the
community
let
the
young
girls
dance
he
said
still
the
mysterious
was
not
found
one
day
a
girl
overheard
voices
in
the
youth
lodge
and
peering
in
saw
a
beautiful
woman
sharing
his
meal
she
told
the
news
to
the
chief
and
it
soon
became
known
that
the
chief
son
was
married
to
a
beautiful
stranger
the
youth
however
wished
to
marry
a
woman
of
his
own
tribe
but
the
maiden
father
having
heard
that
the
young
man
was
already
married
told
his
daughter
that
she
was
only
being
made
fun
of
so
the
girl
had
nothing
more
to
do
with
her
wooer
who
turned
for
consolation
to
his
ring
he
caused
food
to
be
brought
and
placed
the
ring
on
a
seat
the
ring
unavailing
come
he
said
let
us
eat
there
was
no
response
the
would
not
appear
the
youth
was
greatly
disappointed
and
made
up
his
mind
to
go
in
search
of
his
wife
i
am
going
said
he
and
again
his
father
gave
him
good
clothes
and
saddled
a
horse
for
him
when
he
reached
the
spot
where
the
had
first
met
him
he
found
her
trail
leading
up
to
the
spring
and
beyond
it
on
the
other
side
still
following
the
trail
he
saw
before
him
a
very
dilapidated
lodge
at
the
door
of
which
sat
an
old
man
in
rags
the
youth
felt
very
sorry
for
the
tattered
old
fellow
and
gave
him
his
fine
clothes
in
exchange
for
which
he
received
the
other
rags
you
think
you
are
doing
me
a
good
turn
said
the
old
man
but
it
is
i
who
am
going
to
do
you
one
the
woman
you
seek
has
gone
over
the
great
water
when
you
get
to
the
other
shore
talk
with
the
people
you
shall
meet
there
and
if
they
do
not
obey
you
send
them
away
in
addition
to
the
tattered
garments
the
old
man
gave
him
a
hat
a
sword
and
a
lame
old
horse
at
the
edge
of
the
great
water
the
youth
prepared
to
cross
while
his
companion
seated
himself
on
the
shore
closed
his
eyes
and
recited
a
spell
in
a
moment
the
young
man
found
himself
on
the
opposite
shore
here
he
found
a
lodge
inhabited
by
two
aged
who
were
apparently
given
to
eating
human
beings
the
young
stranger
made
the
discovery
that
his
hat
rendered
him
invisible
and
he
was
able
to
move
unseen
among
the
creatures
taking
off
his
hat
for
a
moment
he
took
the
pipe
from
the
lips
of
a
and
pressed
it
against
the
latter
hand
oh
cried
the
i
am

but
the
youth
had
clapped
on
his
hat
and
disappeared

is
not

the
gravely
a
stranger
has
been
here
and
we
have
let
him
escape
when
our
brother
returns
he
will
not
believe
us
if
we
tell
him
the
man
has
vanished
shortly
after
this
another
entered
with
the
body
of
a
man
he
had
killed
when
the
brothers
told
him
their
story
he
was
quite
sceptical
if
i
had
been
here
said
he
i
would
not
have
let
him
escape
as
he
spoke
the
youth
snatched
his
pipe
from
him
and
pressed
it
against
the
back
of
his
hand
oh
said
the
i
am
burnt
it
was
not
i
said
one
brother
it
was
not
i
said
the
other
it
was
i
said
the
youth
pulling
off
his
hat
and
appearing
among
them
what
were
you
talking
about
among
yourselves
here
i
am
do
as
you
said
but
the
were
afraid
we
were
not
speaking
they
said
and
the
youth
put
on
his
hat
and
vanished
what
will
our
brother
say
cried
the
three
in
dismay
when
he
hears
that
a
man
has
been
here
and
we
have
not
killed
him
our
brother
will
surely
hate
us
in
a
few
minutes
another
came
into
the
lodge
carrying
the
body
of
a
child
he
was
very
angry
when
he
heard
that
they
had
let
a
man
escape
the
youth
repeated
his
trick
on
the
appeared
for
a
moment
then
vanished
again
the
fifth
and
last
of
the
brothers
was
also
deceived
in
the
same
manner
seeing
that
the
monsters
were
now
thoroughly
frightened
the
young
man
took
off
his
magic
hat
and
talked
with
them
the
finding
of
the
you
do
wrong
said
he
to
eat
men
like
this
you
should
eat
buffaloes
not
men
i
am
going
away
when
i
come
back
i
will
visit
you
and
if
you
are
eating
buffaloes
you
shall
remain
but
if
you
are
eating
men
i
shall
send
you
away
the
promised
they
would
eat
only
buffaloes
in
future
and
the
young
man
went
on
his
way
to
seek
for
the
when
at
last
he
came
to
the
village
where
she
dwelt
he
found
she
had
married
a
man
of
another
tribe
and
in
a
great
rage
he
swung
the
sword
the
magician
had
given
him
and
slew
her
and
her
husband
and
the
whole
village
after
which
he
returned
the
way
he
had
come
when
he
reached
the
lodge
of
the
he
saw
that
they
had
not
kept
their
promise
to
eat
only
buffaloes
i
am
going
to
send
you
above
he
said
hitherto
you
have
destroyed
men
but
when
i
have
sent
you
away
you
shall
give
them
cooling
rain
to
keep
them
alive
so
he
sent
them
above
where
they
became
the
proceeding
on
his
journey
he
again
crossed
the
great
water
with
a
single
stride
and
related
to
the
old
wizard
all
that
had
happened
i
have
sent
the
above
because
they
would
not
stop
eating
men
have
i
done
well
very
well
i
have
killed
the
whole
village
where
the
was
because
she
had
taken
another
husband
have
i
done
well
very
well
it
was
for
that
i
gave
you
the
sword
the
youth
returned
to
his
father
and
married
a
very
beautiful
woman
of
his
own
village
a
subterranean
adventure
there
lived
in
a
populous
village
a
chief
who
had
two
sons
and
one
daughter
all
of
them
unmarried
both
the
sons
were
in
the
habit
of
joining
the
hunters
when
they
went
to
shoot
buffaloes
and
on
one
such
occasion
a
large
animal
became
separated
from
the
herd
one
of
the
chief
sons
followed
it
and
when
the
pursuit
had
taken
him
some
distance
from
the
rest
of
the
party
the
buffalo
suddenly
disappeared
into
a
large
pit
before
they
could
check
themselves
man
and
horse
had
plunged
in
after
him
when
the
hunters
returned
the
chief
was
greatly
disturbed
to
learn
that
his
son
was
missing
he
sent
the
criers
in
all
directions
and
spared
no
pains
to
get
news
of
the
youth
if
any
person
knows
the
whereabouts
of
the
chiefs
son
shouted
the
criers
let
him
come
and
tell
this
they
repeated
again
and
again
till
at
length
a
young
man
came
forward
who
had
witnessed
the
accident
i
was
standing
on
a
hill
he
said
and
i
saw
the
hunters
and
i
saw
the
son
of
the
chief
and
when
he
was
on
level
ground
he
disappeared
and
i
saw
him
no
more
he
led
the
men
of
the
tribe
to
the
spot
and
they
scattered
to
look
for
signs
of
the
youth
they
found
his
trail
they
followed
it
to
the
pit
and
there
it
stopped
they
pitched
their
tents
round
the
chasm
and
the
chief
begged
his
people
to
descend
into
it
to
search
for
his
son
if
any
man
among
you
is
brave
and
he
said
let
him
enter
there
was
no
response
if
any
one
will
go
i
will
make
him
rich
still
no
one
ventured
to
speak
if
any
one
will
go
i
will
give
him
my
daughter
in
marriage
there
was
a
stir
among
the
braves
and
a
youth
came
forward
i
will
go
he
said
simply
ropes
of
hide
were
made
by
willing
hands
and
secured
to
a
skin
shaped
to
form
a
sort
of
bucket
after
arranging
signals
with
the
party
at
the
mouth
of
the
pit
the
adventurous
searcher
allowed
himself
to
be
lowered
once
fairly
launched
in
the
cimmerian
depths
his
eyes
became
accustomed
to
the
darkness
and
he
saw
first
the
buffalo
then
the
horse
then
the
young
brave
quite
dead
he
put
the
body
of
the
chief
son
into
the
skin
bucket
and
gave
the
signal
for
it
to
be
drawn
up
to
the
surface
but
so
great
was
the
excitement
that
when
his
comrades
had
drawn
up
the
dead
man
they
forgot
about
the
living
one
still
in
the
pit
and
hurried
away
lost
underground
by
and
by
the
hero
got
tired
of
shouting
and
wandered
off
into
the
darkness
he
had
not
gone
very
far
when
he
met
an
old
woman
respectfully
addressing
her
he
told
her
his
story
and
begged
her
to
aid
his
return
to
his
own
country
indeed
i
can
not
help
you
she
said
but
if
you
will
go
to
the
house
of
the
wise
man
who
lives
round
the
corner
you
may
get
what
you
want
having
followed
the
direction
she
had
indicated
with
a
withered
finger
the
youth
shortly
arrived
at
a
lodge
hungry
and
weary
he
knocked
somewhat
impatiently
receiving
no
answer
he
knocked
again
still
more
loudly
this
time
there
was
a
movement
inside
the
lodge
and
a
woman
came
to
the
door
she
led
him
inside
where
her
husband
sat
dejectedly
not
even
rising
to
greet
the
visitor
sadly
the
woman
told
him
that
they
were
mourning
the
death
of
their
only
son
at
a
word
from
his
wife
the
husband
looked
at
the
youth
eagerly
he
rose
and
embraced
him
you
are
like
our
lost
child
said
he
come
and
we
will
make
you
our
son
the
young
brave
then
told
him
his
story
we
shall
treat
you
as
our
child
said
the
wise
man
whatever
you
shall
ask
we
will
give
you
even
should
you
desire
to
leave
us
and
to
return
to
your
own
people
though
he
was
touched
by
the
kindness
of
the
good
folk
there
was
yet
nothing
the
youth
desired
so
much
as
to
return
to
his
kindred
give
me
said
he
a
white
horse
and
a
white
mule
the
return
to
earth
the
old
man
bade
him
go
to
where
the
horses
were
hobbled
and
there
he
found
what
he
had
asked
for
he
also
received
from
his
host
a
magic
piece
of
iron
which
would
enable
him
to
obtain
whatever
he
desired
the
rocks
even
melted
away
at
a
touch
of
this
talisman
thus
equipped
the
adventurer
rode
off
illustration
he
emerged
in
his
own
country
shortly
afterward
he
emerged
in
his
own
country
where
the
first
persons
he
met
were
the
chief
and
his
wife
to
whom
he
disclosed
his
identity
as
he
was
by
this
time
very
much
changed
they
were
sceptical
at
first
but
soon
they
came
to
recognize
him
and
gave
him
a
very
cordial
reception
he
married
the
chief
daughter
and
was
made
head
chieftain
by
his
the
people
built
a
lodge
for
him
in
the
centre
of
the
encampment
and
brought
him
many
valuable
presents
of
clothing
and
horses
on
his
the
criers
were
sent
out
to
tell
the
people
that
on
the
following
day
no
one
must
leave
the
village
or
do
any
work
on
the
morrow
all
the
men
of
the
tribe
went
out
to
hunt
buffaloes
and
the
young
chieftain
accompanied
them
by
means
of
his
magic
piece
of
iron
he
charmed
many
buffaloes
and
slew
more
than
did
the
others
now
it
so
happened
that
the
chief
remaining
son
was
very
jealous
of
his
he
thought
his
father
should
have
given
him
the
chieftainship
and
the
honours
accorded
by
the
people
to
his
young
relative
were
exceedingly
galling
to
him
so
he
made
up
his
mind
to
kill
the
youth
and
destroy
his
beautiful
white
horse
but
the
sagacious
beast
told
its
master
that
some
one
was
plotting
against
his
life
and
duly
warned
he
watched
in
the
stable
every
night
on
the
occasion
of
a
second
great
buffalo
hunt
the
wicked
schemer
found
his
opportunity
by
waving
his
robe
he
scared
the
buffaloes
and
caused
them
to
close
in
on
the
youth
and
trample
him
to
death
but
when
the
herd
had
scattered
and
moved
away
there
was
no
trace
of
the
young
brave
or
of
his
steed
they
had
returned
to
the
underworld
white
feather
the
there
once
dwelt
in
the
heart
of
a
great
forest
an
old
man
and
his
grandchild
so
far
as
he
could
remember
the
boy
had
never
seen
any
human
being
but
his
grandfather
and
though
he
frequently
questioned
the
latter
on
the
subject
of
his
relatives
he
could
elicit
no
information
from
him
the
truth
was
that
they
had
perished
at
the
hands
of
six
great
giants
the
nation
to
which
the
boy
belonged
had
wagered
their
children
against
those
of
the
giants
that
they
would
beat
the
latter
in
a
race
unfortunately
the
giants
won
the
children
of
the
rash
indians
were
forfeited
and
all
were
slain
with
the
exception
of
little
chácopee
whose
grandfather
had
taken
charge
of
him
the
child
learned
to
hunt
and
fish
and
seemed
quite
contented
and
happy
one
day
the
boy
wandered
away
to
the
edge
of
a
prairie
where
he
found
traces
of
an
encampment
returning
he
told
his
grandfather
of
the
ashes
and
he
had
seen
and
asked
for
an
explanation
had
his
grandfather
set
them
there
the
old
man
responded
brusquely
that
there
were
no
ashes
or
he
had
merely
imagined
them
the
boy
was
sorely
puzzled
but
he
let
the
matter
drop
and
next
day
he
followed
a
different
path
quite
suddenly
he
heard
a
voice
addressing
him
as
wearer
of
the
white
feather
now
there
had
been
a
tradition
in
his
tribe
that
a
mighty
man
would
arise
among
them
wearing
a
white
feather
and
performing
prodigies
of
valour
but
of
this
chácopee
as
yet
knew
nothing
so
he
could
only
look
about
him
in
a
startled
way
close
by
him
stood
a
man
which
fact
was
in
itself
sufficiently
astonishing
to
the
boy
who
had
never
seen
any
one
but
his
grandfather
but
to
his
further
bewilderment
he
perceived
that
the
man
was
made
of
wood
from
the
breast
downward
only
the
head
being
of
flesh
you
do
not
wear
the
white
feather
yet
the
curious
stranger
resumed
but
you
will
by
and
by
go
home
and
sleep
you
will
dream
of
a
pipe
a
sack
and
a
large
white
feather
when
you
wake
you
will
see
these
things
by
your
side
put
the
feather
on
your
head
and
you
will
become
a
very
great
warrior
if
you
want
proof
smoke
the
pipe
and
you
will
see
the
smoke
turn
into
pigeons
he
then
proceeded
to
tell
him
who
his
parents
were
and
of
the
manner
in
which
they
had
perished
and
bade
him
avenge
their
death
on
the
giants
to
aid
him
in
the
accomplishment
of
this
feat
he
gave
him
a
magic
vine
which
would
be
invisible
to
the
giants
and
with
which
he
must
trip
them
up
when
they
ran
a
race
with
him
chácopee
returned
home
and
everything
happened
as
the
man
of
wood
had
predicted
the
old
grandfather
was
greatly
surprised
to
see
a
flock
of
pigeons
issuing
from
the
lodge
from
which
chácopee
also
shortly
emerged
wearing
on
his
head
a
white
feather
remembering
the
prophecy
the
old
man
wept
to
think
that
he
might
lose
his
grandchild
in
search
of
the
giants
next
morning
chácopee
set
off
in
search
of
the
giants
whom
he
found
in
a
very
large
lodge
in
the
centre
of
the
forest
the
giants
had
learned
of
his
approach
from
the
spirits
who
carry
the
news
among
themselves
they
mocked
and
scoffed
at
him
but
outwardly
they
greeted
him
with
much
civility
which
however
in
nowise
deceived
him
as
to
their
true
feelings
without
loss
of
time
they
arranged
a
race
between
chácopee
and
the
youngest
giant
the
winner
of
which
was
to
cut
off
the
head
of
the
other
chdcopee
won
with
the
help
of
his
magic
vine
and
killed
his
opponent
next
morning
he
appeared
again
and
decapitated
another
of
his
foes
this
happened
on
five
mornings
on
the
sixth
he
set
out
as
usual
but
was
met
by
the
man
of
wood
who
informed
him
that
on
his
way
to
the
giants
lodge
he
would
encounter
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
the
world
chácopee
downfall
pay
no
attention
to
her
he
said
earnestly
she
is
there
for
your
destruction
when
you
see
her
turn
yourself
into
an
elk
and
you
will
be
safe
from
her
wiles
chácopee
proceeded
on
his
way
and
sure
enough
before
long
he
met
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
the
world
mindful
of
the
advice
he
had
received
he
turned
himself
into
an
elk
but
instead
of
passing
by
the
woman
who
was
really
the
sixth
giant
came
up
to
him
and
reproached
him
with
tears
for
taking
the
form
of
an
elk
when
she
had
travelled
so
far
to
become
his
wife
chácopee
was
so
touched
by
her
grief
and
beauty
that
he
resumed
his
own
shape
and
endeavoured
to
console
her
with
gentle
words
and
caresses
at
last
he
fell
asleep
with
his
head
in
her
lap
the
beautiful
woman
once
more
became
the
cruel
giant
and
seizing
his
axe
the
monster
broke
chácopee
back
then
turning
him
into
a
dog
he
bade
him
rise
and
follow
him
the
white
feather
he
stuck
in
his
own
head
fancying
that
magic
powers
accompanied
the
wearing
of
it
illustration
everything
happened
as
the
man
of
wood
had
predicted
in
the
path
of
the
travellers
there
lay
a
certain
village
in
which
dwelt
two
young
girls
the
daughters
of
a
chief
having
heard
the
prophecy
concerning
the
wearer
of
the
white
feather
each
made
up
her
mind
that
she
would
marry
him
when
he
should
appear
therefore
when
they
saw
a
man
approaching
with
a
white
feather
in
his
hair
the
elder
ran
to
meet
him
invited
him
into
her
lodge
and
soon
after
married
him
the
younger
who
was
gentle
and
timid
took
the
dog
into
her
home
and
treated
him
with
great
kindness
one
day
while
the
giant
was
out
hunting
he
saw
the
dog
casting
a
stone
into
the
water
immediately
the
stone
became
a
beaver
which
the
dog
caught
and
killed
the
giant
strove
to
emulate
this
feat
and
was
successful
but
when
he
went
home
and
ordered
his
wife
to
go
outside
and
fetch
the
beaver
only
a
stone
lay
by
the
door
next
day
he
saw
the
dog
plucking
a
withered
branch
and
throwing
it
on
the
ground
where
it
became
a
deer
which
the
dog
slew
the
giant
performed
this
magic
feat
also
but
when
his
wife
went
to
the
door
of
the
lodge
to
fetch
the
deer
she
saw
only
a
piece
of
rotten
wood
nevertheless
the
giant
had
some
success
in
the
chase
and
his
wife
repaired
to
the
home
of
her
father
to
tell
him
what
a
skilful
hunter
her
husband
was
she
also
spoke
of
the
dog
that
lived
with
her
sister
and
his
skill
in
the
chase
the
transformation
the
old
chief
suspected
magic
and
sent
a
deputation
of
youths
and
maidens
to
invite
his
younger
daughter
and
her
dog
to
visit
him
to
the
surprise
of
the
deputation
no
dog
was
there
but
an
exceedingly
handsome
warrior
but
alas
chácopee
could
not
speak
the
party
set
off
for
the
home
of
the
old
chief
where
they
were
warmly
welcomed
it
was
arranged
to
hold
a
general
meeting
so
that
the
wearer
of
the
white
feather
might
show
his
prowess
and
magical
powers
first
of
all
they
took
the
giant
pipe
which
had
belonged
to
chácopee
and
the
warriors
smoked
it
one
after
the
other
when
it
came
to
turn
he
signified
that
the
giant
should
precede
him
the
giant
smoked
but
to
the
disappointment
of
the
assembly
nothing
unusual
happened
then
chácopee
took
the
pipe
and
as
the
smoke
ascended
it
became
a
flock
of
pigeons
at
the
same
moment
he
recovered
his
speech
and
recounted
his
strange
adventures
to
the
astounded
listeners
their
indignation
against
the
giant
was
unbounded
and
the
chief
ordered
that
he
should
be
given
the
form
of
a
dog
and
stoned
to
death
by
the
people
chácopee
gave
a
further
proof
of
his
right
to
wear
the
white
feather
calling
for
a
he
cut
it
into
little
pieces
and
strewed
it
on
the
prairie
next
day
he
summoned
the
braves
of
the
tribe
to
a
and
at
no
great
distance
they
found
a
magnificent
herd
the
pieces
of
hide
had
become
buffaloes
the
people
greeted
this
exhibition
of
magic
art
with
loud
acclamations
and
reputation
was
firmly
established
with
the
tribe
chácopee
begged
the
chief
permission
to
take
his
wife
on
a
visit
to
his
grandfather
which
was
readily
granted
and
the
old
man
gratitude
and
delight
more
than
repaid
them
for
the
perils
of
their
journey
how
the
rabbit
caught
the
sun
once
upon
a
time
the
rabbit
dwelt
in
a
lodge
with
no
one
but
his
grandmother
to
keep
him
company
every
morning
he
went
hunting
very
early
but
no
matter
how
early
he
was
he
always
noticed
that
some
one
with
a
very
long
foot
had
been
before
him
and
had
left
a
trail
the
rabbit
resolved
to
discover
the
identity
of
the
hunter
who
forestalled
him
so
one
fine
morning
he
rose
even
earlier
than
usual
in
the
hope
of
encountering
the
stranger
but
all
to
no
purpose
for
the
mysterious
one
had
gone
leaving
behind
him
as
was
his
wont
the
trail
of
the
long
foot
this
irritated
the
rabbit
profoundly
and
he
returned
to
the
lodge
to
consult
with
his
grandmother
grandmother
he
grumbled
although
i
rise
early
every
morning
and
set
my
traps
in
the
hope
of
snaring
game
some
one
is
always
before
me
and
frightens
the
game
away
i
shall
make
a
snare
and
catch
him
why
should
you
do
so
replied
his
grandmother
in
what
way
has
he
harmed
you
it
is
sufficient
that
i
hate
him
replied
the
querulous
rabbit
and
departed
he
secreted
himself
among
the
bushes
and
waited
for
nightfall
he
had
provided
himself
with
a
stout
bowstring
which
he
arranged
as
a
trap
in
the
place
where
the
footprints
were
usually
to
be
found
then
he
went
home
but
returned
very
early
to
examine
his
snare
when
he
arrived
at
the
spot
he
discovered
that
he
had
caught
the
intruder
who
was
indeed
no
less
a
personage
than
the
sun
he
ran
home
at
the
top
of
his
speed
to
acquaint
his
grandmother
with
the
news
he
did
not
know
what
he
had
caught
so
his
grandmother
bade
him
seek
the
forest
once
more
and
find
out
on
returning
he
saw
that
the
sun
was
in
a
violent
passion
how
dare
you
snare
me
he
cried
angrily
come
hither
and
untie
me
at
once
the
rabbit
advanced
cautiously
and
circled
round
him
in
abject
terror
at
last
he
clucked
his
head
and
running
in
cut
the
bowstring
which
secured
the
sun
with
his
knife
the
sun
immediately
soared
upward
and
was
quickly
lost
to
sight
and
the
reason
why
the
hair
between
the
rabbit
shoulders
is
yellow
is
that
he
was
scorched
there
by
the
great
heat
which
came
from
the
when
he
loosed
him
how
the
rabbit
slew
the
devouring
hill
in
the
long
ago
there
existed
a
hill
of
propensities
which
drew
people
into
its
mouth
and
devoured
them
the
rabbit
grandmother
warned
him
not
to
approach
it
upon
any
account
but
the
rabbit
was
rash
and
the
very
fact
that
he
had
been
warned
against
the
vicinity
made
him
all
the
more
anxious
to
visit
it
so
he
went
to
the
hill
and
cried
mockingly
draw
me
into
your
mouth
come
devour
me
but
knew
the
rabbit
so
he
took
no
notice
of
him
shortly
afterward
a
came
that
way
and
opened
his
mouth
so
that
they
took
it
to
be
a
great
cavern
and
entered
the
rabbit
waiting
his
chance
pressed
in
behind
them
but
when
he
reached
stomach
the
monster
felt
that
something
disagreed
with
him
and
he
vomited
the
rabbit
up
illustration
once
more
the
rabbit
entered
disguised
as
a
man
later
in
the
day
another
appeared
and
again
opened
his
capacious
gullet
the
hunters
entered
unwittingly
and
were
devoured
and
once
more
the
rabbit
entered
disguised
as
a
man
by
magic
art
this
time
the
cannibal
hill
did
not
eject
him
imprisoned
in
the
monster
entrails
he
saw
in
the
distance
the
whitened
bones
of
folk
who
had
been
devoured
the
still
undigested
bodies
of
others
and
some
who
were
yet
alive
mocking
the
rabbit
said
why
do
you
not
eat
you
should
have
eaten
that
very
fat
heart
and
seizing
his
knife
he
made
as
if
to
devour
it
at
this
set
up
a
dismal
howling
but
the
rabbit
merely
mocked
him
and
slit
the
heart
in
twain
at
this
the
hill
split
asunder
and
all
the
folk
who
had
been
imprisoned
within
it
went
out
again
stretched
their
arms
to
the
blue
sky
and
hailed
the
rabbit
as
their
deliverer
for
it
was
heart
that
had
been
sundered
the
people
gathered
together
and
said
let
us
make
the
rabbit
chief
but
he
mocked
them
and
told
them
to
be
gone
that
all
he
desired
was
the
heap
of
fat
the
hill
had
concealed
within
its
entrails
which
would
serve
him
and
his
old
grandmother
for
food
for
many
a
day
with
that
the
rabbit
went
homeward
carrying
the
fat
on
his
back
and
he
and
his
grandmother
rejoiced
exceedingly
and
were
never
in
want
again
chapter
vi
myths
and
legends
of
the
pawnees
the
pawnees
or
caddoan
indians
the
caddoan
stock
the
principal
representatives
of
which
are
the
pawnees
are
now
settled
in
oklahoma
and
north
dakota
from
the
earliest
period
they
seem
to
have
been
cultivators
of
the
soil
as
well
as
hunters
and
skilled
in
the
arts
of
weaving
and
they
possessed
an
elaborate
form
of
religious
ceremonial
the
following
myths
well
exemplify
how
strongly
the
pawnee
was
gifted
with
the
religious
sense
the
sacred
bundle
a
certain
young
man
was
very
vain
of
his
personal
appearance
and
always
wore
the
finest
clothes
and
richest
adornments
he
could
procure
among
other
possessions
he
had
a
down
feather
of
an
eagle
which
he
wore
on
his
head
when
he
went
to
war
and
which
possessed
magical
properties
he
was
unmarried
and
cared
nothing
for
women
though
doubtless
there
was
more
than
one
maiden
of
the
village
who
would
not
have
disdained
the
hand
of
the
young
hunter
for
he
was
as
brave
and
as
he
was
handsome
one
day
while
he
was
out
hunting
with
his
companions
the
indians
hunted
on
foot
in
those
days
he
got
separated
from
the
others
and
followed
some
buffaloes
for
a
considerable
distance
the
animals
managed
to
escape
with
the
exception
of
a
young
cow
which
had
become
stranded
in
a
the
youth
fitted
an
arrow
to
his
bow
and
was
about
to
fire
when
he
saw
that
the
buffalo
had
vanished
and
only
a
young
and
pretty
woman
was
in
sight
the
hunter
was
rather
perplexed
for
he
could
not
understand
where
the
animal
had
gone
to
nor
where
the
woman
had
come
from
however
he
talked
to
the
maiden
and
found
her
so
agreeable
that
he
proposed
to
marry
her
and
return
with
her
to
his
tribe
she
consented
to
marry
him
but
only
on
condition
that
they
remained
where
they
were
to
this
he
agreed
and
gave
her
as
a
wedding
gift
a
string
of
blue
and
white
beads
he
wore
round
his
neck
one
evening
when
he
returned
home
after
a
day
hunting
he
found
that
his
camp
was
gone
and
all
round
about
were
the
marks
of
many
hoofs
no
trace
of
his
wife
body
could
he
discover
and
at
last
mourning
her
bitterly
he
returned
to
his
tribe
years
elapsed
and
one
summer
morning
as
he
was
playing
the
stick
game
with
his
friends
a
little
boy
came
toward
him
wearing
round
his
neck
a
string
of
blue
and
white
beads
father
he
said
mother
wants
you
the
hunter
was
annoyed
at
the
interruption
i
am
not
your
father
he
replied
go
away
the
boy
went
away
and
the
man
companions
laughed
at
him
when
they
heard
him
addressed
as
for
they
knew
he
was
a
and
unmarried
however
the
boy
returned
in
a
little
while
he
was
sent
away
again
by
the
angry
hunter
but
one
of
the
players
now
suggested
that
he
should
accompany
the
child
and
see
what
he
wanted
all
the
time
the
hunter
had
been
wondering
where
he
had
seen
the
beads
before
as
he
reflected
he
saw
a
buffalo
cow
and
calf
running
across
the
prairie
and
suddenly
he
remembered
taking
his
bow
and
arrows
he
followed
the
buffaloes
whom
he
now
recognized
as
his
wife
and
child
a
long
and
wearisome
journey
they
had
the
woman
was
angry
with
her
husband
and
dried
up
every
creek
they
came
to
so
that
he
feared
he
would
die
of
thirst
but
the
strategy
of
his
son
obtained
food
and
drink
for
him
until
they
arrived
at
the
home
of
the
buffaloes
the
big
bulls
the
leaders
of
the
herd
were
very
angry
and
threatened
to
kill
him
first
however
they
gave
him
a
test
telling
him
that
if
he
accomplished
it
he
should
live
six
cows
all
exactly
alike
were
placed
in
a
row
and
he
was
told
that
if
he
could
point
out
his
wife
his
life
would
be
spared
his
son
helped
him
secretly
and
he
succeeded
the
old
bulls
were
surprised
and
much
annoyed
for
they
had
not
expected
him
to
distinguish
his
wife
from
the
other
cows
they
gave
him
another
test
he
was
requested
to
pick
out
his
son
from
among
several
calves
again
the
young
buffalo
helped
him
to
perform
the
feat
not
yet
satisfied
they
decreed
that
he
must
run
a
race
if
he
should
win
they
would
let
him
go
they
chose
their
fastest
runners
but
on
the
day
set
for
the
race
a
thin
coating
of
ice
covered
the
ground
and
the
buffaloes
could
not
run
at
all
while
the
young
indian
ran
swiftly
and
steadily
and
won
with
ease
the
magic
feather
the
chief
bulls
were
still
angry
however
and
determined
that
they
would
kill
him
even
though
he
had
passed
their
tests
so
they
made
him
sit
on
the
ground
all
the
strongest
and
fiercest
bulls
round
him
together
they
rushed
at
him
and
in
a
little
while
his
feather
was
seen
floating
in
the
air
the
chief
bulls
called
on
the
others
to
stop
for
they
were
sure
that
he
must
be
trampled
to
pieces
by
this
time
but
when
they
drew
back
there
sat
the
indian
in
the
centre
of
the
circle
with
his
feather
in
his
hair
it
was
in
fact
his
magic
feather
to
which
he
owed
his
escape
and
a
second
rush
which
the
buffaloes
made
had
as
little
effect
on
him
seeing
that
he
was
possessed
of
magical
powers
the
buffaloes
made
the
best
of
matters
and
welcomed
him
into
their
camp
on
condition
that
he
would
bring
them
gifts
from
his
tribe
this
he
agreed
to
do
when
the
indian
returned
with
his
wife
and
son
to
the
village
people
they
found
that
there
was
no
food
to
be
had
but
the
produced
some
meat
from
under
her
robe
and
they
ate
of
it
afterward
they
went
back
to
the
herd
with
gifts
which
pleased
the
buffaloes
greatly
the
chief
bulls
knowing
that
the
people
were
in
want
of
food
offered
to
return
with
the
hunter
his
son
who
also
wished
to
return
arranged
to
accompany
the
herd
in
the
form
of
a
buffalo
while
his
parents
went
ahead
in
human
shape
the
father
warned
the
people
that
they
must
not
kill
his
son
when
they
went
to
hunt
buffaloes
for
he
said
the
yellow
calf
would
always
return
leading
more
buffaloes
by
and
by
the
child
came
to
his
father
saying
that
he
would
no
more
visit
the
camp
in
the
form
of
a
boy
as
he
was
about
to
lead
the
herd
eastward
ere
he
went
he
told
his
father
that
when
the
hunters
sought
the
chase
they
should
kill
the
yellow
calf
and
sacrifice
it
to
atius
tiráwa
tan
its
hide
and
wrap
in
the
skin
an
ear
of
corn
and
other
sacred
things
every
year
they
should
look
out
for
another
yellow
calf
sacrifice
it
and
keep
a
piece
of
its
fat
to
add
to
the
bundle
then
when
food
was
scarce
and
famine
threatened
the
tribe
the
chiefs
should
gather
in
council
and
pay
a
friendly
visit
to
the
young
buffalo
and
he
would
tell
tiráwa
of
their
need
so
that
another
yellow
calf
might
be
sent
to
lead
the
herd
to
the
people
when
he
had
said
this
the
boy
left
the
camp
all
was
done
as
he
had
ordered
food
became
plentiful
and
the
father
became
a
chief
greatly
respected
by
his
people
his
however
he
almost
forgot
and
one
night
she
vanished
so
distressed
was
the
chief
and
so
remorseful
for
his
neglect
of
her
that
he
never
recovered
but
withered
away
and
died
but
the
sacred
bundle
was
long
preserved
in
the
tribe
as
a
magic
charm
to
bring
the
buffalo
their
sacred
bundles
were
most
precious
to
the
indians
and
were
guarded
religiously
in
times
of
famine
they
were
opened
by
the
priests
with
much
ceremony
the
above
story
is
given
to
explain
the
origin
of
that
belonging
to
the
pawnee
tribe
the
there
was
once
a
boy
of
the
pawnee
tribe
who
imitated
the
ways
of
a
bear
and
indeed
he
much
resembled
that
animal
when
he
played
with
the
other
boys
of
his
village
he
would
pretend
to
be
a
bear
and
even
when
he
grew
up
he
would
often
tell
his
companions
laughingly
that
he
could
turn
himself
into
a
bear
whenever
he
liked
his
resemblance
to
the
animal
came
about
in
this
manner
before
the
boy
was
born
his
father
had
gone
on
the
and
at
some
distance
from
his
home
had
come
upon
a
tiny
the
little
creature
looked
at
him
so
wistfully
and
was
so
small
and
helpless
that
he
could
not
pass
by
without
taking
notice
of
it
so
he
stooped
and
picked
it
up
in
his
arms
tied
some
indian
tobacco
round
its
neck
and
said
i
know
that
the
great
spirit
tiráwa
will
care
for
you
but
i
can
not
go
on
my
way
without
putting
these
things
round
your
neck
to
show
that
i
feel
kindly
toward
you
i
hope
that
the
animals
will
take
care
of
my
son
when
he
is
born
and
help
him
to
grow
up
a
great
and
wise
man
with
that
he
went
on
his
way
on
his
return
he
told
his
wife
of
his
encounter
with
the
little
bear
told
her
how
he
had
taken
it
in
his
arms
and
looked
at
it
and
talked
to
it
now
there
is
an
indian
superstition
that
a
woman
before
a
child
is
born
must
not
look
fixedly
at
or
think
much
about
any
animal
or
the
infant
will
resemble
it
so
when
the
warrior
boy
was
born
he
was
found
to
have
the
ways
of
a
bear
and
to
become
more
and
more
like
that
animal
the
older
he
grew
the
boy
quite
aware
of
the
resemblance
often
went
away
by
himself
into
the
forest
where
he
used
to
pray
to
the
bear
the
slain
on
one
occasion
when
he
was
quite
grown
up
he
accompanied
a
war
party
of
the
pawnees
as
their
chief
they
travelled
a
considerable
distance
but
ere
they
arrived
at
any
village
they
fell
into
a
trap
prepared
for
them
by
their
enemies
the
sioux
taken
completely
off
their
guard
the
pawnees
to
the
number
of
about
forty
were
slain
to
a
man
the
part
of
the
country
in
which
this
incident
took
place
was
rocky
and
and
harboured
many
bears
and
the
bodies
of
the
dead
pawnees
lay
in
a
ravine
in
the
path
of
these
animals
when
they
came
to
the
body
of
the
a
instantly
recognized
it
as
that
of
their
benefactor
who
had
sacrificed
smokes
to
them
made
songs
about
them
and
done
them
many
a
good
turn
during
his
lifetime
she
called
to
her
companion
and
begged
him
to
do
something
to
bring
the
to
life
again
the
other
protested
that
he
could
do
nothing
nevertheless
he
added
i
will
try
if
the
sun
were
shining
i
might
succeed
but
when
it
is
dark
and
cloudy
i
am
powerless
the
resuscitation
of
the
the
sun
was
shining
but
fitfully
that
day
however
long
intervals
of
gloom
succeeded
each
gleam
of
sunlight
but
the
two
bears
set
about
collecting
the
remains
of
the
who
was
indeed
sadly
mutilated
and
lying
down
on
his
body
they
worked
over
him
with
their
magic
medicine
till
he
showed
signs
of
returning
life
at
length
he
fully
regained
consciousness
and
finding
himself
in
the
presence
of
two
bears
was
at
a
loss
to
know
what
had
happened
to
him
but
the
animals
related
how
they
had
brought
him
to
life
and
the
sight
of
his
dead
comrades
lying
around
him
recalled
what
had
gone
before
gratefully
acknowledging
the
service
the
bears
had
done
him
he
accompanied
them
to
their
den
he
was
still
very
weak
and
frequently
fainted
but
ere
long
he
recovered
his
strength
and
was
as
well
as
ever
only
he
had
no
hair
on
his
head
for
the
sioux
had
scalped
him
during
his
sojourn
with
the
bears
he
was
taught
all
the
things
that
they
knew
which
was
a
great
deal
for
all
indians
know
that
the
bear
is
one
of
the
wisest
of
animals
however
his
host
begged
him
not
to
regard
the
wonderful
things
he
did
as
the
outcome
of
his
own
strength
but
to
give
thanks
to
tiráwa
who
had
made
the
bears
and
had
given
them
their
wisdom
and
greatness
finally
he
told
the
to
return
to
his
people
where
he
would
become
a
very
great
man
great
in
war
and
in
wealth
but
at
the
same
time
he
must
not
forget
the
bears
nor
cease
to
imitate
them
for
on
that
would
depend
much
of
his
success
i
shall
look
after
you
he
concluded
if
i
die
you
shall
die
if
i
grow
old
you
shall
grow
old
along
with
me
this
tree
pointing
to
a
cedar
shall
be
a
protector
to
you
it
never
becomes
old
it
is
always
fresh
and
beautiful
the
gift
of
tiráwa
and
if
a
thunderstorm
should
come
while
you
are
at
home
throw
some
on
the
fire
and
you
will
be
safe
giving
him
a
cap
to
hide
his
hairless
scalp
the
bear
then
bade
him
depart
arrived
at
his
home
the
young
man
was
greeted
with
amazement
for
it
was
thought
that
he
had
perished
with
the
rest
of
the
war
party
but
when
he
convinced
his
parents
that
it
was
indeed
their
son
who
visited
them
they
received
him
joyfully
when
he
had
embraced
his
friends
and
had
been
congratulated
by
them
on
his
return
he
told
them
of
the
bears
who
were
waiting
outside
the
village
taking
presents
of
indian
tobacco
clay
and
beads
he
returned
to
them
and
again
talked
with
the
the
latter
hugged
him
saying
as
my
fur
has
touched
you
you
will
be
great
as
my
hands
have
touched
your
hands
you
will
be
fearless
and
as
my
mouth
touches
your
mouth
you
will
be
wise
with
that
the
bears
departed
true
to
his
words
the
animal
made
the
the
greatest
warrior
of
his
tribe
he
was
the
originator
of
the
bear
dance
which
the
pawnees
still
practise
he
lived
to
an
advanced
age
greatly
honoured
by
his
people
chapter
vii
myths
and
legends
of
the
northern
and
indians
haida
there
is
a
curious
haida
story
told
of
the
origin
of
certain
supernatural
people
who
are
supposed
to
speak
through
the
or
and
of
how
they
got
their
names
ten
brothers
went
out
to
hunt
with
their
dogs
while
they
were
climbing
a
steep
rocky
mountain
a
thick
mist
enveloped
them
and
they
were
compelled
to
remain
on
the
heights
by
and
by
they
made
a
fire
and
the
youngest
who
was
full
of
mischief
cast
his
bow
in
it
when
the
bow
was
burnt
the
hunters
were
astonished
to
see
it
on
the
level
ground
below
the
mischievous
brother
thereupon
announced
his
intention
of
following
his
weapon
and
by
the
same
means
though
the
others
tried
hard
to
dissuade
him
he
threw
himself
on
the
blazing
fire
and
was
quickly
consumed
his
brothers
then
beheld
him
on
the
plain
vigorously
exhorting
them
to
follow
his
example
one
by
one
they
did
so
some
boldly
some
timorously
but
all
found
themselves
at
last
on
the
level
ground
as
the
brothers
travelled
on
they
heard
a
wren
chirping
and
they
saw
that
one
of
their
number
had
a
blue
hole
in
his
heart
farther
on
they
found
a
hawk
feather
which
they
tied
in
the
hair
of
the
youngest
they
came
at
length
to
a
deserted
village
on
the
shores
of
an
inlet
and
took
possession
of
one
of
the
huts
for
food
they
ate
some
mussels
and
having
satisfied
their
hunger
they
set
out
to
explore
the
settlement
nothing
rewarded
their
search
but
an
old
canoe
and
covered
with
nettles
when
they
had
removed
the
weeds
and
scraped
off
the
moss
they
repaired
it
and
the
mischievous
one
who
had
led
them
into
the
fire
made
a
bark
bailer
for
it
on
which
he
carved
the
representation
of
a
bird
another
who
had
in
his
hair
a
bunch
of
feathers
took
a
pole
and
jumped
into
the
canoe
the
rest
followed
and
the
canoe
slid
away
from
the
shore
soon
they
came
in
sight
of
a
village
where
a
was
performing
attracted
by
the
noise
and
the
glow
of
the
fire
the
warrior
at
the
bow
stepped
ashore
and
advanced
to
see
what
was
going
on
now
he
heard
the
say
the
chief
is
coming
ashore
the
indian
was
ashamed
to
hear
himself
thus
mistakenly
as
he
thought
referred
to
as
a
supernatural
being
and
returned
to
the
canoe
the
next
one
advanced
to
the
village
chief
is
coming
ashore
said
the
the
indian
saw
the
blue
hole
at
his
heart
and
he
also
was
ashamed
and
returned
to
his
brothers
the
third
was
named
the
fourth
the
fifth
the
sixth
the
seventh
the
eighth
the
ninth
and
the
eldest
and
last
each
as
he
heard
his
name
pronounced
returned
to
the
canoe
when
they
had
all
heard
the
and
were
assembled
once
more
the
eldest
brother
said
we
have
indeed
become
supernatural
people
which
was
quite
true
for
by
burning
themselves
in
the
fire
they
had
reached
the
land
of
souls
this
myth
would
appear
to
explain
the
fancied
resemblance
between
smoke
and
the
shadowy
or
vaporous
substance
of
which
spirits
or
ghosts
are
supposed
to
be
composed
the
supernatural
sister
the
ten
brothers
floated
round
the
coast
till
they
reached
another
village
here
they
took
on
board
a
woman
whose
arms
had
been
accidentally
burned
by
her
husband
who
mistook
them
for
the
arms
of
some
one
embracing
his
wife
the
woman
was
severely
burned
and
was
in
great
distress
the
supernatural
brothers
made
a
crack
in
the
bottom
of
the
canoe
and
told
the
woman
to
place
her
hands
in
it
her
wounds
were
immediately
healed
they
called
her
their
sister
and
seated
her
in
the
canoe
to
bail
out
the
water
when
they
came
to
the
dj
the
stream
near
which
dwelt
the
latter
came
and
talked
to
them
repeating
the
names
which
the
had
given
them
and
calling
their
sister
see
page
paddle
to
the
island
you
see
in
the
distance
she
added
the
wizard
who
lives
there
is
he
who
paints
those
who
are
to
become
supernatural
beings
go
to
him
and
he
will
paint
you
dance
four
nights
in
your
canoe
and
you
will
be
finished
they
did
as
she
bade
them
and
the
wizard
dressed
them
in
a
manner
becoming
to
their
position
as
supernatural
beings
he
gave
them
dancing
hats
dancing
skirts
and
rattles
and
drew
a
cloud
over
the
outside
of
their
canoe
the
birth
of
sîñ
the
haida
of
british
columbia
and
the
queen
charlotte
islands
possess
a
striking
myth
relating
to
the
incarnation
of
the
their
principal
deity
the
daughter
of
a
certain
chief
went
one
day
to
dig
in
the
beach
after
she
had
worked
some
time
she
dug
up
a
she
was
about
to
throw
it
to
one
side
when
she
thought
she
heard
a
sound
coming
from
it
like
that
of
a
child
crying
examining
the
shell
she
found
a
small
baby
inside
she
carried
it
home
and
wrapped
it
in
a
warm
covering
and
tended
it
so
carefully
that
it
grew
rapidly
and
soon
began
to
walk
she
was
sitting
beside
the
child
one
day
when
he
made
a
movement
with
his
hand
as
if
imitating
the
drawing
of
a
bowstring
so
to
please
him
she
took
a
copper
bracelet
from
her
arm
and
hammered
it
into
the
shape
of
a
bow
which
she
strung
and
gave
him
along
with
two
arrows
he
was
delighted
with
the
tiny
weapon
and
immediately
set
out
to
hunt
small
game
with
it
every
day
he
returned
to
his
with
some
trophy
of
his
skill
one
day
it
was
a
goose
another
a
woodpecker
and
another
a
blue
jay
one
morning
he
awoke
to
find
himself
and
his
mother
in
a
fine
new
house
with
gorgeous
splendidly
carved
and
illuminated
in
rich
reds
blues
and
greens
the
carpenter
who
had
raised
this
fine
building
married
his
mother
and
was
very
kind
to
him
he
took
the
boy
down
to
the
and
caused
him
to
sit
with
his
face
looking
toward
the
expanse
of
the
pacific
and
so
long
as
the
lad
looked
across
the
boundless
blue
there
was
fair
weather
his
father
used
to
go
fishing
and
one
day
sîñ
for
such
was
the
name
expressed
a
wish
to
accompany
him
they
obtained
for
bait
and
proceeded
to
the
where
the
lad
instructed
his
father
to
pronounce
certain
magical
formulæ
the
result
of
which
was
that
their
was
violently
agitated
and
their
canoe
pulled
round
an
adjacent
island
three
times
when
the
disturbance
stopped
at
last
they
pulled
in
the
line
and
dragged
out
a
monster
covered
with
piles
of
halibut
one
day
sîñ
went
out
wearing
a
his
mother
beheld
him
rise
in
stature
until
he
soared
above
her
and
brooded
like
a
bank
of
shining
clouds
over
the
ocean
then
he
descended
and
donned
the
skin
of
a
blue
jay
again
he
rose
over
the
sea
and
shone
resplendently
once
more
he
soared
upward
wearing
the
skin
of
a
woodpecker
and
the
waves
reflected
a
colour
as
of
fire
then
he
said
mother
i
shall
see
you
no
more
i
am
going
away
from
you
when
the
sky
looks
like
my
face
painted
by
my
father
there
will
be
no
wind
then
the
fishing
will
be
good
his
mother
bade
him
farewell
sadly
yet
with
the
proud
knowledge
that
she
had
nurtured
a
divinity
but
her
sorrow
increased
when
her
husband
intimated
that
it
was
time
for
him
to
depart
as
well
her
supernatural
son
and
husband
however
left
her
a
portion
of
their
power
for
when
she
sits
by
the
inlet
and
loosens
her
robe
the
wind
scurries
down
between
the
banks
and
the
waves
are
ruffled
with
tempest
and
the
more
she
loosens
the
garment
the
greater
is
the
storm
they
call
her
in
the
indian
tongue
but
she
dwells
mostly
in
the
winds
and
when
the
cold
morning
airs
draw
up
from
the
sea
landward
she
makes
an
offering
of
feathers
to
her
glorious
son
the
feathers
are
flakes
of
snow
and
they
serve
to
remind
him
that
the
world
is
weary
for
a
glimpse
of
his
golden
face
and
southeast
a
haida
myth
relates
how
a
supernatural
being
went
to
war
with
the
wind
at
the
town
lying
farthest
south
on
the
queen
charlotte
islands
the
wind
is
particularly
rude
and
boisterous
on
that
coast
and
it
was
with
the
intention
of
punishing
him
for
his
violence
that
challenged
him
first
of
all
however
he
set
about
building
a
canoe
for
himself
the
first
one
he
made
split
and
he
was
obliged
to
throw
it
away
the
second
also
split
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
he
had
made
it
stouter
than
the
other
another
and
another
he
built
making
each
one
stronger
than
the
last
but
every
attempt
ended
in
failure
and
at
last
exceedingly
vexed
at
his
unskilfulness
he
was
on
the
point
of
giving
the
task
up
he
would
have
done
so
indeed
but
for
the
intervention
of
greatest
fool
hitherto
had
been
trying
to
form
two
canoes
from
one
log
by
means
of
wedges
greatest
fool
stood
watching
him
for
a
time
amused
at
his
clumsiness
and
finally
showed
him
that
he
ought
to
use
bent
wedges
and
though
he
was
perhaps
the
last
person
from
whom
might
expect
to
learn
anything
the
unsuccessful
builder
of
canoes
adopted
the
suggestion
with
the
happiest
results
when
at
length
he
was
satisfied
that
he
had
made
a
good
canoe
he
let
it
down
into
the
water
and
sailed
off
in
search
of
illustration
he
seized
hold
of
the
hair
by
and
by
he
floated
right
down
to
his
enemy
abode
and
when
he
judged
himself
to
be
above
it
he
rose
in
the
canoe
and
flung
out
a
challenge
there
was
no
reply
again
he
called
and
this
time
a
rapid
current
began
to
float
past
him
bearing
on
its
surface
a
quantity
of
seaweed
the
shrewd
fancied
he
saw
the
matted
hair
of
his
enemy
floating
among
the
seaweed
he
seized
hold
of
it
and
after
it
came
the
latter
in
a
great
passion
began
to
call
on
his
nephews
to
help
him
the
first
to
be
summoned
was
immediately
a
deep
red
suffused
the
sky
then
the
stormy
tints
died
away
and
the
wind
rose
with
a
harsh
murmur
when
this
wind
had
reached
its
full
strength
another
was
summoned
the
blast
increased
to
a
hurricane
and
the
were
blown
off
and
carried
away
and
fell
thickly
about
the
canoe
where
was
making
use
of
his
magic
arts
to
protect
himself
again
another
wind
was
called
up
who
set
the
stones
and
sand
flying
about
as
he
shrieked
in
answer
to
the
summons
came
next
the
spirit
of
the
fog
which
strikes
terror
into
the
hearts
of
those
at
sea
and
he
was
followed
by
a
numerous

water
so
that
he
was
obliged
to
give

relinquishing
his
hold

it
was

by

the

that
he
returned
to
his
own
place
mother

that

the
beaver
and
the
porcupine
this
is
the
tale
of
a
feud
between
the
beavers
and
the
porcupines
beaver
had
laid
in
a
plentiful
store
of
food
but
porcupine
had
failed
to
do
so
and
one
day
when
the
former
was
out
hunting
the
latter
went
to
his
lodge
and
stole
his
provision
when
beaver
returned
he
found
that
his
food
was
gone
and
he
questioned
porcupine
about
the
matter
did
you
steal
my
food
he
asked
no
answered
porcupine
one
can
not
steal
food
from
supernatural
beings
and
you
and
i
both
possess
supernatural
powers
of
course
this
was
mere
bluff
on
the
part
of
porcupine
and
it
in
nowise
deceived
his
companion
you
stole
my
food
said
beaver
angrily
and
he
tried
to
seize
porcupine
with
his
teeth
but
the
sharp
spines
of
the
latter
disconcerted
him
though
he
was
not
easily
repulsed
for
a
time
he
fought
furiously
but
at
length
he
was
forced
to
retreat
with
his
face
covered
with
quills
from
his
spiny
adversary
his
friends
and
relatives
greeted
him
sympathetically
his
father
summoned
all
the
beaver
people
told
them
of
the
injuries
his
son
had
received
and
bade
them
avenge
the
honour
of
their
clan
the
people
at
once
repaired
to
the
abode
of
porcupine
who
from
the
fancied
security
of
his
lodge
heaped
insults
and
abuse
on
them
the
indignant
beaver
people
pulled
his
house
down
about
his
ears
seized
him
and
carried
him
in
spite
of
his
threats
and
protests
to
a
desolate
island
where
they
left
him
to
starve
it
seemed
to
porcupine
that
he
had
not
long
to
live
nothing
grew
on
the
island
save
two
trees
neither
of
which
was
edible
and
there
was
no
other
food
within
reach
he
called
loudly
to
his
friends
to
come
to
his
assistance
but
there
was
no
answer
in
vain
he
summoned
all
the
animals
who
were
related
to
him
his
cries
never
reached
them
when
he
had
quite
given
up
hope
he
fancied
he
heard
something
whisper
to
him
call
upon
call
upon
at
first
he
did
not
understand
but
thought
his
imagination
must
be
playing
tricks
with
him
again
the
voice
whispered
to
him
sing
north
songs
and
you
will
be
saved
wondering
much
but
with
hope
rising
in
his
breast
porcupine
did
as
he
was
bidden
and
raised
his
voice
in
the
north
songs
let
the
cold
weather
come
he
sang
let
the
water
be
smooth
the
finding
of
porcupine
after
a
time
the
weather
became
very
cold
a
strong
wind
blew
from
the
north
and
the
water
became
smooth
with
a
layer
of
ice
when
it
was
sufficiently
frozen
to
bear
the
weight
of
the
porcupine
people
they
crossed
over
to
the
island
in
search
of
their
brother
they
were
greatly
rejoiced
to
see
him
but
found
him
so
weak
that
he
could
hardly
walk
and
he
had
to
be
carried
to
his
father
lodge
when
they
wanted
to
know
why
beaver
had
treated
him
so
cruelly
he
replied
that
it
was
because
he
had
eaten
beaver
food
the
porcupine
people
thinking
this
a
small
excuse
were
greatly
incensed
against
the
beavers
and
immediately
declared
war
on
them
but
the
latter
were
generally
victorious
and
the
war
by
and
by
came
to
an
inglorious
end
for
the
porcupines
the
spiny
tribe
still
however
imagined
that
they
had
a
grievance
against
beaver
and
plotted
to
take
his
life
they
carried
him
to
the
top
of
a
tall
tree
thinking
that
as
the
beavers
could
not
climb
he
would
be
in
the
same
plight
as
their
brother
had
been
on
the
island
but
by
the
simple
expedient
of
eating
the
tree
downward
from
the
top
beaver
was
enabled
to
return
to
his
home
the
daughter
a
haida
indian
was
sailing
in
his
canoe
with
his
two
children
and
his
wife
at
low
tide
they
had
been
paddling
for
some
time
when
they
came
to
a
place
where
some
stones
lay
and
they
could
discern
the
tracks
and
see
where
its
food
was
lying
piled
up
the
man
who
was
a
landed
upon
the
rocks
with
the
intention
of
finding
and
killing
the
but
while
he
was
searching
for
it
the
monster
suddenly
emerged
from
its
hole
and
dragged
him
through
the
aperture
into
its
den
his
wife
and
children
believing
him
to
be
dead
paddled
away
the
monster
which
had
seized
the
man
was
a
female
and
she
dragged
him
far
below
into
the
precincts
of
the
town
where
dwelt
her
father
the
chief
and
there
he
married
the
which
had
captured
him
many
years
passed
and
at
length
the
man
became
and
greatly
desired
to
see
his
wife
and
family
once
more
he
begged
the
chief
to
let
him
go
and
after
some
demur
his
request
was
granted
the
departed
in
one
canoe
and
his
wife
the
daughter
in
another
the
canoes
were
magical
and
sped
along
of
themselves
soon
they
reached
his
father
town
by
the
aid
of
the
enchanted
craft
he
had
brought
much
wealth
with
him
from
the
kingdom
and
with
this
he
traded
and
became
a
great
chief
then
his
children
found
him
and
came
to
him
they
were
grown
up
and
to
celebrate
his
he
held
a
great
feast
five
great
feasts
he
held
one
after
another
and
at
each
of
them
his
children
and
his
human
wife
were
present
but
the
wife
began
to
pine
for
the
one
day
while
her
husband
and
she
sat
in
his
father
house
he
began
to
melt
at
the
same
time
the
wife
disappeared
betwixt
the
planks
of
the
flooring
her
husband
then
assumed
the
form
and
a
second
soft
slimy
body
followed
the
first
through
the
planks
the
wife
and
her
husband
had
returned
to
her
father
realm
this
myth
of
course
approximates
to
those
of
the
who
escape
from
their
mortal
husbands
and
the
and
other
who
pining
for
their
natural
environment
take
wing
one
fine
day
and
leave
their
chinook
tales
the
chinooks
formerly
dwelt
on
columbia
river
from
the
dalles
to
its
mouth
and
on
the
lower
willamette
with
the
exception
of
a
few
individuals
they
are
now
extinct
but
their
myths
have
been
successfully
collected
and
preserved
they
were
the
natives
of
the
coast
cunning
in
bargaining
yet
dwelling
on
a
communal
plan
their
chief
physical
characteristic
was
a
high
and
narrow
forehead
artificially
flattened
concerning
this
people
professor
daniel
wilson
says
the
chinooks
are
among
the
most
remarkable
of
the
indians
and
carry
the
process
of
cranial
distortion
to
the
greatest
excess
they
are
in
some
respects
a
superior
race
making
slaves
of
other
tribes
and
evincing
considerable
skill
in
such
arts
as
are
required
in
their
wild
forest
and
coast
life
their
chief
are
bows
and
arrows
the
former
made
from
the
and
the
latter
feathered
and
pointed
with
bone
their
canoes
are
hollowed
out
of
the
trunk
of
the
which
attains
to
a
great
size
in
that
region
and
are
frequently
ornamented
with
much
taste
and
skill
in
such
a
canoe
the
dead
chinook
chief
is
deposited
surrounded
with
all
the
requisites
for
war
or
the
favourite
occupations
of
life
presenting
a
correspondence
in
his
sepulchral
rites
to
the
ancient
pagan
viking
who
as
appears
alike
from
the
contents
of
the
scandinavian
and
from
the
narratives
of
the
sagas
was
interred
or
consumed
in
his
and
the
form
of
that
favourite
scene
of
ocean
triumphs
perpetuated
in
the
that
covered
his
ashes
the
story
of
blue
jay
and
ioi
the
chinooks
tell
many
stories
of
blue
jay
the
tricky
mischievous
and
among
these
tales
there
are
three
which
are
concerned
with
his
sister
ioi
blue
jay
whose
disposition
resembled
that
of
the
bird
he
symbolized
delighted
in
tormenting
ioi
by
deliberately
misinterpreting
her
commands
and
by
repeating
at
every
opportunity
his
favourite
phrase
ioi
is
always
telling
lies
in
the
first
of
the
trilogy
ioi
requested
her
brother
to
take
a
wife
from
among
the
dead
to
help
her
with
her
work
in
house
and
field
to
this
blue
jay
readily
assented
and
he
took
for
his
spouse
a
chieftain
daughter
who
had
been
recently
buried
but
ioi
request
that
his
wife
should
be
an
old
one
he
disregarded
take
her
to
the
land
of
the
supernatural
people
said
ioi
when
she
had
seen
her
brother
bride
and
they
will
restore
her
to
life
blue
jay
set
out
on
his
errand
and
after
a
day
journey
arrived
with
his
wife
at
a
town
inhabited
by
the
supernatural
folk
how
long
has
she
been
dead
they
asked
him
when
he
stated
his
purpose
in
visiting
them
a
day
he
replied
the
supernatural
people
shook
their
heads
we
can
not
help
you
said
they
you
must
travel
to
the
town
where
people
are
restored
who
have
been
dead
for
a
day
blue
jay
obediently
resumed
his
journey
and
at
the
end
of
another
day
he
reached
the
town
to
which
he
had
been
directed
and
told
its
inhabitants
why
he
had
come
how
long
has
she
been
dead
they
asked
two
days
said
he
then
we
can
do
nothing
replied
the
supernatural
folk
for
we
can
only
restore
people
who
have
been
dead
one
day
however
you
can
go
to
the
town
where
those
are
brought
to
life
who
have
been
dead
two
days
another
day
journey
brought
blue
jay
and
his
wife
to
the
third
town
again
he
found
himself
a
day
late
and
was
directed
to
a
fourth
town
and
from
that
one
to
yet
another
at
the
fifth
town
however
the
supernatural
people
took
pity
on
him
and
recovered
his
wife
from
death
blue
jay
they
made
a
chieftain
among
them
and
conferred
many
honours
upon
him
after
a
time
he
got
tired
of
living
in
state
among
the
supernatural
people
and
returned
home
when
he
was
once
more
among
his
kindred
his
young
the
chief
son
learnt
that
his
sister
was
alive
and
married
to
blue
jay
hastily
the
boy
carried
the
news
to
his
father
the
old
chief
who
sent
a
message
to
blue
jay
demanding
his
hair
in
payment
for
his
wife
the
messenger
received
no
reply
and
the
angry
chief
gathered
his
people
round
him
and
led
them
to
blue
jay
lodge
on
their
approach
blue
jay
turned
himself
into
a
bird
and
flew
away
while
his
wife
swooned
all
the
efforts
of
her
kindred
could
not
bring
the
woman
round
and
they
called
on
her
husband
to
return
it
was
in
vain
however
blue
jay
would
not
come
back
and
his
wife
journeyed
finally
to
the
land
of
souls
the
marriage
of
ioi
the
second
portion
of
the
trilogy
relates
how
the
setting
out
one
night
from
the
shadowland
to
buy
a
wife
took
ioi
the
sister
of
blue
jay
who
disappeared
before
morning
after
a
year
had
elapsed
her
brother
decided
to
go
in
search
of
her
but
though
he
inquired
the
way
to
the
from
all
manner
of
birds
and
beasts
he
got
a
satisfactory
answer
from
none
of
them
and
would
never
have
arrived
at
his
destination
at
all
had
he
not
been
carried
thither
at
last
by
supernatural
means
in
the
he
found
his
sister
surrounded
by
heaps
of
bones
which
she
introduced
to
him
as
his
relatives
by
marriage
at
certain
times
these
relics
would
attain
a
semblance
of
humanity
but
instantly
became
bones
again
at
the
sound
of
a
loud
voice
a
fishing
expedition
in
at
his
sister
request
blue
jay
went
fishing
with
his
young
finding
that
when
he
spoke
in
a
loud
tone
he
caused
the
boy
to
become
a
heap
of
bones
in
the
canoe
blue
jay
took
a
malicious
pleasure
in
reducing
him
to
that
condition
it
was
just
the
sort
of
trick
he
loved
to
play
illustration
a
fishing
expedition
in
the
fish
they
caught
were
nothing
more
than
leaves
and
branches
and
blue
jay
in
disgust
threw
them
back
into
the
water
but
to
his
chagrin
when
he
returned
his
sister
told
him
that
they
were
really
fish
and
that
he
ought
not
to
have
flung
them
away
however
he
consoled
himself
with
the
reflection
ioi
is
always
telling
lies
besides
teasing
ioi
he
played
many
pranks
on
the
inoffensive
ghosts
sometimes
he
would
put
the
skull
of
a
child
on
the
shoulders
of
a
man
and
vice
versa
and
take
a
mischievous
delight
in
the
ludicrous
result
when
they
came
on
one
occasion
when
the
prairies
were
on
fire
ioi
bade
her
brother
extinguish
the
flames
for
this
purpose
she
gave
him
five
buckets
of
water
warning
him
that
he
must
not
pour
it
on
the
burning
prairies
until
he
came
to
the
fourth
of
them
blue
jay
disobeyed
her
as
he
was
wont
to
do
and
with
dire
results
for
when
he
reached
the
fifth
prairie
he
found
he
had
no
water
to
pour
on
it
while
endeavouring
to
beat
out
the
flames
he
was
so
seriously
burned
that
he
died
and
returned
to
the
ghosts
as
one
of
themselves
but
without
losing
his
mischievous
propensities
blue
jay
and
ioi
go
visiting
the
third
tale
of
the
trilogy
tells
how
blue
jay
and
ioi
went
to
visit
their
friends
the
magpie
was
the
first
to
receive
the
visitors
and
by
means
of
magic
he
provided
food
for
them
putting
a
salmon
egg
into
a
kettle
of
boiling
water
he
placed
the
kettle
on
the
fire
and
immediately
it
was
full
of
salmon
eggs
so
that
when
they
had
eaten
enough
blue
jay
and
ioi
were
able
to
carry
a
number
away
on
the
following
day
the
magpie
called
for
the
kettle
they
had
borrowed
blue
jay
tried
to
entertain
his
visitor
in
the
same
magical
fashion
as
the
latter
had
entertained
him
but
his
attempt
was
so
ludicrous
that
the
magpie
could
not
help
laughing
at
him
the
pair
next
visit
was
to
the
duck
who
obtained
food
for
them
by
making
her
children
dive
for
trout
again
there
was
twice
as
much
as
they
could
eat
and
blue
jay
and
ioi
carried
away
the
remainder
on
a
mat
during
the
return
visit
of
the
duck
blue
jay
tried
to
emulate
this
feat
also
using
ioi
children
instead
of
the
ducklings
his
attempt
was
again
unsuccessful
the
two
visited
in
turn
the
black
bear
the
beaver
and
the
seal
all
of
whom
similarly
supplied
refreshment
for
them
in
a
magical
manner
but
blue
jay
attempts
at
imitating
these
creatures
were
futile
a
visit
to
the
shadows
concluded
the
round
and
the
adventurers
returned
home
the
bride
a
brother
and
sister
left
destitute
by
the
death
of
their
father
a
chief
of
the
chinooks
were
forced
to
go
hunting
every
day
to
obtain
a
livelihood
as
they
hunted
the
mists
came
down
and
with
them
the
supernatural
people
one
of
whom
became
enamoured
of
the
girl
the
ghostly
husband
sent
his
wife
gifts
of
stranded
timber
and
so
that
when
her
son
was
born
she
might
want
for
nothing
the
mischievous
blue
jay
hearing
of
the
abundance
of
meat
in
the
young
chief
house
apprised
his
own
chief
of
the
circumstance
and
brought
all
the
village
to
share
it
the
supernatural
people
annoyed
that
their
bounty
should
be
thus
misused
abducted
the
young
chief
sister
along
with
her
child
the
woman
aunt
the
crow
gathered
many
potentilla
and
other
roots
placed
them
in
her
canoe
and
put
out
to
sea
she
came
to
the
country
of
the
supernatural
folk
and
when
they
saw
her
approaching
they
all
ran
down
to
the
beach
to
greet
her
they
greedily
snatched
at
the
roots
she
had
brought
with
her
and
devoured
them
eating
the
most
succulent
and
throwing
away
those
that
were
not
so
much
to
their
taste
the
crow
soon
found
her
niece
who
laughed
at
her
for
bringing
such
fare
to
such
a
land
do
you
think
they
are
men
that
you
bring
them
potentilla
roots
she
cried
they
only
eat
certain
of
the
roots
you
have
fetched
hither
because
they
have
magical
properties
the
next
time
you
come
bring
the
sort
of
roots
they
seized
upon
and
you
can
also
bring
a
basket
of
potentilla
roots
for
me
the
she
then
called
upon
a
dog
which
was
gambolling
close
at
hand
take
this
dog
she
said
to
the
crow
it
belongs
to
your
when
you
come
near
the
shore
say
a
whale
dog
and
see
what
happens
the
crow
bade
farewell
to
her
niece
and
her
canoe
steered
for
the
world
of
mortals
again
the
dog
lay
quietly
in
the
stern
when
about
across
the
crow
recollected
her
advice
catch
a
whale
good
dog
she
cried
encouragingly
the
dog
arose
and
at
that
moment
a
whale
crossed
the
path
of
the
canoe
the
dog
sank
his
teeth
in
the
great
fish
and
the
frail
bark
rocked
violently
hold
him
fast
good
fellow
cried
the
crow
excitedly
hold
him
fast
but
the
canoe
tossed
so
dangerously
and
shipped
so
much
water
that
in
a
great
fright
she
bade
the
dog
let
go
he
did
so
and
lay
down
in
the
stern
again
the
crow
arrived
at
the
world
of
men
once
more
and
after
landing
turned
round
to
call
her
wonderful
dog
ashore
but
no
trace
of
him
was
visible
he
had
disappeared
illustration
the
mists
came
down
and
with
them
the
supernatural
people
once
more
the
crow
gathered
many
roots
and
plants
taking
especial
care
to
collect
a
good
supply
of
the
sort
the
supernatural
people
were
fond
of
and
gathering
only
a
small
basket
of
potentilla
for
the
second
time
she
crossed
over
to
the
land
of
the
divine
beings
who
on
espying
her
succulent
cargo
devoured
it
at
once
she
carried
the
potentilla
roots
to
her
niece
and
when
in
her
house
noticed
the
dog
she
had
received
and
lost
her
niece
informed
her
that
she
should
not
have
ordered
the
animal
to
seize
the
whale
in
but
should
have
waited
until
she
was
nearer
the
land
the
crow
departed
once
more
taking
the
dog
with
her
when
they
approached
the
land
of
men
the
crow
called
to
the
animal
to
catch
a
whale
but
it
stirred
not
then
the
crow
poured
some
water
over
him
and
he
started
up
and
killed
a
large
whale
the
carcass
of
which
drifted
on
to
the
beach
when
the
people
came
down
and
cut
it
up
for
food
the
chinooks
visit
the
supernaturals
some
time
after
this
the
young
chief
expressed
a
desire
to
go
to
see
his
sister
so
his
people
manned
a
large
canoe
and
set
forth
the
chief
of
the
supernatural
people
observing
their
approach
warned
his
subjects
that
the
mortals
might
do
something
to
their
disadvantage
and
by
means
of
magic
he
covered
the
sea
with
ice
the
air
became
exceedingly
cold
so
cold
indeed
that
blue
jay
who
had
accompanied
the
young
chief
leapt
into
the
water
at
this
one
of
the
supernatural
people
on
shore
laughed
and
cried
out
ha
ha
blue
jay
has
drowned
himself
at
this
taunt
the
young
chief
in
the
canoe
arose
and
taking
the
ice
which
covered
the
surface
of
the
sea
cast
it
away
at
sight
of
such
power
the
supernatural
folk
became
much
alarmed
the
chief
and
his
followers
now
came
to
land
and
walking
up
the
beach
found
it
deserted
not
a
single
supernatural
person
was
to
be
seen
espying
the
chief
house
however
the
chinooks
approached
it
it
was
guarded
by
one
at
each
side
of
the
door
the
chief
cautiously
warned
his
people
against
attempting
an
entrance
but
the
irrepressible
blue
jay
tried
to
leap
past
the
and
got
severely
bitten
for
his
pains
howling
dismally
he
rushed
seaward
the
young
chief
annoyed
that
the
divine
beings
should
have
cause
for
laughter
against
any
of
his
people
now
darted
forward
seized
the
monsters
one
in
each
hand
and
hurled
them
far
away
at
this
second
feat
the
supernatural
folk
set
up
a
hubbub
of
rage
and
dismay
which
was
turned
to
loud
laughter
when
blue
jay
claimed
the
deed
as
his
loudly
chanting
his
own
praises
the
chinooks
taking
heart
entered
the
lodge
but
the
supernatural
folk
vanished
leaving
only
the
chief
sister
behind
the
chinooks
had
had
nothing
to
eat
since
leaving
their
own
country
and
blue
jay
who
like
most
worthless
folk
was
always
hungry
complained
loudly
that
he
was
famished
his
brother
robin
sullenly
ordered
him
to
be
silent
suddenly
a
supernatural
being
with
a
long
beak
emerged
from
under
the
bed
and
splitting
wood
with
his
beak
kindled
a
large
fire
robin
said
blue
jay
that
is
the
spirit
of
our
slave
soon
the
house
was
full
of
smoke
and
a
voice
was
heard
calling
out
for
the
an
individual
with
an
enormous
belly
made
his
appearance
and
swallowed
all
the
smoke
so
that
the
house
became
light
a
small
dish
was
brought
containing
only
one
piece
of
meat
but
the
mysterious
voice
called
for
the
who
appeared
and
sliced
the
fragment
so
with
his
beak
that
the
plate
was
full
to
overflowing
then
he
blew
upon
it
and
it
became
a
large
canoe
full
of
meat
which
the
chinooks
finished
much
to
the
amazement
of
the
supernatural
people
the
four
tests
after
a
while
a
messenger
from
the
divine
people
approached
and
asked
to
be
told
whether
the
indians
would
accept
a
challenge
to
a
diving
contest
the
defeated
to
lose
their
lives
this
was
agreed
to
and
blue
jay
was
selected
to
dive
for
the
chinooks
he
had
taken
the
precaution
of
placing
some
bushes
in
his
canoe
which
he
threw
into
the
water
before
diving
with
his
opponent
a
woman
when
his
breath
gave
out
he
came
to
the
surface
concealing
his
head
under
the
floating
bushes
then
he
sank
into
the
water
again
and
cried
to
his
opponent
where
are
you
here
i
am
she
replied
four
times
did
blue
jay
cunningly
come
up
for
breath
hidden
beneath
the
bushes
and
on
diving
for
the
last
time
he
found
the
woman
against
whom
he
was
pitted
lying
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
almost
unconscious
he
took
his
club
which
he
had
concealed
beneath
his
blanket
and
struck
her
on
the
nape
of
the
neck
then
he
rose
and
claimed
the
victory
the
supernatural
people
much
chagrined
suggested
a
climbing
contest
to
which
blue
jay
readily
agreed
but
he
was
warned
that
if
he
was
beaten
he
would
be
dashed
to
pieces
he
placed
upright
a
piece
of
ice
which
was
so
high
that
it
reached
the
clouds
the
supernaturals
matched
a
chipmunk
against
him
when
the
competitors
had
reached
a
certain
height
blue
jay
grew
tired
so
he
used
his
wings
and
flew
upward
the
chipmunk
kept
her
eyes
closed
and
did
not
notice
the
deception
blue
jay
hit
her
on
the
neck
with
his
club
so
that
she
fell
and
blue
jay
was
adjudged
the
winner
a
shooting
match
was
next
proposed
by
the
exasperated
supernaturals
in
which
the
persons
engaged
were
to
shoot
at
one
another
this
the
chinooks
won
by
taking
a
beaver
as
their
champion
and
tying
a
millstone
in
front
of
him
a
sweating
match
was
also
won
by
the
chinooks
taking
ice
with
them
into
the
superheated
caves
where
the
contest
took
place
as
a
last
effort
to
shame
the
chinooks
the
divine
people
suggested
that
the
two
chiefs
should
engage
in
a
contest
this
was
agreed
to
and
the
supernatural
chief
wife
after
warning
them
placed
blue
jay
and
robin
under
her
armpits
to
keep
them
quiet
as
they
descended
to
the
beach
she
said
to
her
brother
four
whales
will
pass
you
but
do
not
harpoon
any
until
the
fifth
appears
robin
did
as
he
was
bid
but
the
woman
had
a
hard
time
in
keeping
the
curious
blue
jay
hidden
the
four
whales
passed
but
the
young
chief
took
no
heed
then
the
fifth
slid
by
he
thrust
his
harpoon
deep
into
its
blubber
and
cast
it
ashore
the
supernatural
chief
was
unsuccessful
in
his
attempts
and
so
the
chinooks
won
again
on
the
result
being
known
blue
jay
could
no
longer
be
restrained
and
falling
from
under
the
woman
arm
he
was
drowned
on
setting
out
for
home
the
chief
was
advised
to
tie
robin
blanket
to
a
magical
rope
with
which
his
sister
provided
him
when
the
chinooks
were
in
the
middle
of
the
ocean
the
supernatural
people
raised
a
great
storm
to
encompass
their
destruction
but
the
charm
the
chief
sister
had
given
them
proved
efficacious
and
they
reached
their
own
land
in
safety
blue
jay
death
may
be
regarded
as
merely
figurative
for
he
appears
in
many
subsequent
chinook
tales
this
myth
is
undoubtedly
one
of
the
class
which
relates
to
the
of
hades
see
the
remarks
at
the
conclusion
of
the
myth
of
the
thunderer
the
thunderer
there
were
five
brothers
who
lived
together
four
of
them
were
accustomed
to
spend
their
days
in
hunting
elk
while
the
fifth
who
was
the
youngest
was
always
compelled
to
remain
at
the
camp
they
lived
amicably
enough
save
that
the
youngest
grumbled
at
never
being
able
to
go
to
the
hunting
one
day
as
the
youth
sat
brooding
over
his
grievance
the
silence
was
suddenly
broken
by
a
hideous
din
which
appeared
to
come
from
the
region
of
the
doorway
he
was
at
a
loss
to
understand
the
cause
of
it
and
anxiously
wished
for
the
return
of
his
brothers
suddenly
there
appeared
before
him
a
man
of
gigantic
size
strangely
apparelled
he
demanded
food
and
the
frightened
boy
remembering
that
they
were
well
provided
hastily
arose
to
satisfy
the
stranger
desires
he
brought
out
an
ample
supply
of
meat
and
tallow
but
was
astonished
to
find
that
the
strange
being
lustily
called
for
more
the
youth
thoroughly
terrified
hastened
to
gratify
the
monster
craving
and
the
giant
ate
steadily
on
hour
after
hour
until
the
brothers
returned
at
the
end
of
the
day
to
discover
the
glutton
devouring
the
fruits
of
their
hunting
the
monster
appeared
not
to
heed
the
brothers
but
anxious
to
satisfy
his
enormous
appetite
he
still
ate
a
fresh
supply
of
meat
had
been
secured
and
this
the
brothers
placed
before
him
he
continued
to
gorge
himself
throughout
the
night
and
well
into
the
next
day
at
last
the
meat
was
at
an
end
and
the
brothers
became
alarmed
what
next
would
the
insatiable
creature
demand
they
approached
him
and
told
him
that
only
skins
remained
but
he
replied
what
shall
i
eat
grandchildren
now
that
there
are
only
skins
and
you
they
did
not
appear
to
understand
him
until
they
had
questioned
him
several
times
on
realizing
that
the
glutton
meant
to
devour
them
they
determined
to
escape
so
boiling
the
skins
which
they
set
before
him
they
fled
through
a
hole
in
the
hut
outside
they
placed
a
dog
and
told
him
to
send
the
giant
in
the
direction
opposite
to
that
which
they
had
taken
night
fell
and
the
monster
slept
while
the
dog
kept
a
weary
vigil
over
the
exit
by
which
his
masters
had
escaped
day
dawned
as
the
giant
crept
through
the
gap
he
asked
the
dog
which
way
went
your
masters
the
animal
replied
by
setting
his
head
in
the
direction
opposite
to
the
true
one
the
giant
observed
the
sign
and
went
on
the
road
the
dog
indicated
after
proceeding
for
some
distance
he
found
that
the
young
men
could
not
have
gone
that
way
so
he
returned
to
the
hut
to
find
the
dog
still
there
again
he
questioned
the
animal
who
merely
repeated
his
previous
movement
the
monster
once
more
set
out
but
unable
to
discover
the
fugitives
he
again
returned
three
times
he
repeated
these
fruitless
journeys
at
last
he
succeeded
in
getting
on
to
the
right
path
and
shortly
came
within
sight
of
the
brothers
the
thunderer
immediately
they
saw
their
pursuer
they
endeavoured
to
outrun
him
but
without
avail
the
giant
gained
ground
and
soon
overtook
the
eldest
whom
he
slew
he
then
made
for
the
others
and
slew
three
more
the
youngest
only
was
left
the
lad
hurried
on
until
he
came
to
a
river
on
the
bank
of
which
was
a
man
fishing
whose
name
was
the
thunderer
this
person
he
implored
to
convey
him
to
the
opposite
side
after
much
hesitation
the
thunderer
agreed
and
rowing
him
over
the
stream
he
commanded
the
fugitive
to
go
to
his
hut
and
returned
to
his
nets
by
this
time
the
monster
had
gained
the
river
and
on
seeing
the
fisherman
he
asked
to
be
ferried
over
also
the
thunderer
at
first
refused
but
was
eventually
persuaded
by
the
offer
of
a
piece
of
twine
afraid
that
the
boat
might
capsize
the
thunderer
stretched
himself
across
the
river
and
commanded
the
giant
to
walk
over
his
body
the
monster
unaware
of
treachery
readily
responded
but
no
sooner
had
he
reached
the
thunderer
legs
than
the
latter
set
them
apart
thus
precipitating
him
into
the
water
his
hat
also
fell
in
after
him
the
thunderer
now
gained
his
feet
and
watched
the
giant
drifting
helplessly
down
the
stream
he
did
not
wish
to
save
the
monster
for
he
believed
him
to
be
an
evil
spirit
okulam
noise
of
surge
will
be
your
name
he
said
only
when
the
storm
is
raging
will
you
be
heard
when
the
weather
is
very
bad
your
hat
will
also
be
heard
as
he
concluded
this
prophecy
the
giant
disappeared
from
sight
the
thunderer
then
gathered
his
nets
together
and
went
to
his
hut
the
youth
whom
he
had
saved
married
his
daughter
and
continued
to
remain
with
him
one
day
the
youth
desired
to
watch
his
fishing
for
whales
his
wife
warned
him
against
doing
so
he
paid
no
heed
to
her
warning
however
but
went
to
the
sea
where
he
saw
the
thunderer
struggling
with
a
whale
his
flew
into
a
great
rage
and
a
furious
storm
arose
the
thunderer
looked
toward
the
land
and
immediately
the
storm
increased
in
fury
with
thunder
and
lightning
so
he
threw
down
his
and
departed
for
home
followed
by
his
on
reaching
the
house
the
young
man
gathered
some
pieces
of
coal
and
climbed
a
mountain
there
he
blackened
his
face
and
a
high
wind
arose
which
carried
everything
before
it
his
house
was
blown
away
and
the
thunderer
seeing
that
it
was
hopeless
to
attempt
to
save
anything
from
the
wreck
commanded
his
daughter
to
seek
for
her
husband
she
hurried
up
the
where
she
found
him
and
told
him
he
was
the
cause
of
all
the
destruction
but
concluded
father
says
you
may
look
at
him
when
he
catches
whales
he
followed
his
wife
back
to
the
valley
and
washed
his
face
immediately
he
had
done
so
the
storm
abated
going
up
to
his
he
said
i
shall
go
down
to
the
beach
and
you
shall
see
me
catching
whales
then
the
thunderer
and
he
rebuilt
their
hut
on
the
following
morning
they
went
down
to
the
together
the
young
man
cast
his
net
into
the
sea
after
a
little
while
a
whale
entered
the
net
the
youth
quickly
pulled
the
net
toward
him
reached
for
the
whale
and
flung
it
at
the
feet
of
his
thunderer
was
amazed
and
called
to
him
ho
ho
my
you
are
just
as
i
was
when
i
was
a
young
man
the
beast
comrades
soon
after
this
the
thunderer
daughter
gave
birth
to
two
sons
the
thunderer
sent
the
young
man
into
the
woods
to
capture
two
wolves
with
which
he
used
to
play
when
a
boy
the
soon
returned
with
the
animals
and
threw
them
at
the
feet
of
the
thunderer
but
they
severely
mauled
the
old
man
who
seeing
that
they
had
forgotten
him
cried
piteously
to
his
to
carry
them
back
to
the
forest
shortly
after
this
he
again
despatched
his
in
search
of
two
bears
with
which
he
had
also
been
friendly
the
young
man
obeyed
but
the
bears
treated
the
old
man
as
the
wolves
had
done
so
he
likewise
returned
them
to
their
native
haunts
for
the
third
time
the
went
into
the
forest
for
two
grizzly
bears
and
when
he
saw
them
he
called
i
come
to
carry
you
away
the
bears
instantly
came
toward
him
and
suffered
themselves
to
be
carried
before
the
thunderer
but
they
also
had
forgotten
their
former
playmate
and
immediately
set
upon
him
so
that
the
young
man
was
compelled
to
return
with
them
to
the
forest
thunderer
had
scarcely
recovered
from
this
last
attack
when
he
sent
his
into
the
same
forest
after
two
panthers
which
in
his
younger
days
had
also
been
his
companions
without
the
slightest
hesitation
the
young
man
arose
and
went
into
the
wood
where
he
met
the
panthers
he
called
to
them
in
the
same
gentle
manner
i
come
to
take
you
away
the
animals
seemed
to
understand
and
followed
him
but
thunderer
was
dismayed
when
he
saw
how
wild
they
had
grown
they
would
not
allow
him
to
tame
them
and
after
suffering
their
attack
he
sent
them
back
to
the
forest
this
ended
the
thunderer
exciting
pastime
the
tests
the
thunderer
then
sent
his
to
split
a
log
of
wood
when
this
had
been
done
he
put
the
young
man
strength
to
the
test
by
placing
him
within
the
hollow
trunk
and
closing
the
wood
around
him
but
the
young
man
succeeded
in
freeing
himself
and
set
off
for
the
hut
carrying
the
log
with
him
on
reaching
his
home
he
dropped
the
wood
before
the
door
and
caused
the
earth
to
quake
the
thunderer
jumped
up
in
alarm
and
ran
to
the
door
rejoicing
in
the
might
of
his
oh
my
he
cried
you
are
just
as
i
was
when
i
was
young
the
two
continued
to
live
together
and
the
young
sons
grew
into
manhood
one
day
the
thunderer
approached
his
and
said
go
to
the
supernatural
folk
and
bring
me
their
hoops
the
the
obeyed
he
travelled
for
a
long
distance
and
eventually
reached
the
land
of
the
spirits
they
stood
in
a
circle
and
he
saw
that
they
played
with
a
large
hoop
he
then
remembered
that
he
must
secure
the
hoop
but
he
was
afraid
to
approach
them
as
the
light
of
the
place
dazzled
him
he
waited
until
darkness
had
set
in
and
leaving
his
dashed
through
the
circle
and
secured
the
hoop
the
supernatural
people
pursued
him
with
torches
just
as
this
was
taking
place
his
wife
remembered
him
she
called
to
her
children
now
whip
your
grandfather
this
they
did
while
the
old
man
wept
this
chastisement
brought
rain
upon
the
supernatural
people
and
extinguished
their
torches
they
dared
not
pursue
the
young
man
farther
so
they
returned
to
their
country
the
adventurer
was
now
left
in
peace
to
continue
his
homeward
journey
he
handed
over
the
hoop
to
thunderer
who
now
sent
him
to
capture
the
targets
of
the
spirit
folk
the
gladly
undertook
the
journey
and
again
entered
the
bright
region
of
he
found
the
supernaturals
shooting
at
the
targets
and
when
night
had
fallen
he
picked
them
up
and
ran
away
the
spirits
lit
their
torches
and
followed
him
his
wife
once
more
was
reminded
of
her
absent
husband
and
commanded
her
sons
to
repeat
the
punishment
upon
their
grandfather
the
rain
recommenced
and
the
torches
of
the
pursuers
were
destroyed
the
young
man
returned
in
peace
to
his
dwelling
and
placed
the
targets
before
his
he
had
not
been
long
home
before
a
restless
spirit
took
possession
of
him
he
longed
for
further
adventure
and
at
last
decided
to
set
out
in
quest
of
it
arraying
himself
in
his
fine
necklaces
of
teeth
and
strapping
around
his
waist
two
quivers
of
arrows
he
bade
farewell
to
his
wife
and
sons
he
journeyed
until
he
reached
a
large
village
which
consisted
of
five
rows
of
houses
these
he
carefully
inspected
the
last
house
was
very
small
but
he
entered
it
he
was
met
by
two
old
women
who
were
known
as
the
mice
immediately
they
saw
him
they
muttered
to
each
other
oh
now
blue
jay
will
make
another
chief
unhappy
on
the
young
man
arrival
in
the
village
blue
jay
became
conscious
of
a
stranger
in
the
midst
of
the
people
he
straightway
betook
himself
to
the
house
of
the
mice
he
then
returned
to
his
chief
saying
that
a
strange
chief
wished
to
hold
a
shooting
match
blue
jay
chief
seemed
quite
willing
to
enter
into
the
contest
with
the
stranger
so
he
sent
blue
jay
back
to
the
house
to
inform
the
young
chief
of
his
willingness
blue
jay
led
the
stranger
down
to
the
beach
where
the
targets
stood
soon
the
old
chief
arrived
and
the
shooting
match
began
but
the
adventurer
skill
could
not
compare
with
the
old
chief
who
finally
defeated
him
blue
jay
now
saw
his
opportunity
he
sprang
upon
the
stranger
tore
out
his
hair
cut
off
his
head
and
severed
the
limbs
from
his
body
he
carried
the
pieces
to
the
house
and
hung
up
the
head
at
nightfall
the
mice
fed
the
head
and
managed
to
keep
it
alive
this
process
of
feeding
went
on
for
many
months
the
old
women
never
tiring
of
their
task
a
full
year
had
passed
and
the
unfortunate
adventurer
sons
began
to
fear
for
his
safety
they
decided
to
search
for
him
arming
themselves
they
made
their
way
to
the
large
village
in
which
their
father
was
imprisoned
they
entered
the
house
of
the
mice
and
there
saw
the
two
old
women
who
asked
oh
chiefs
where
did
you
come
from
we
search
for
our
father
they
replied
but
the
old
women
warned
them
of
blue
jay
treachery
and
advised
them
to
depart
the
young
men
would
not
heed
the
advice
and
succeeded
in
drawing
from
the
women
the
story
of
their
father
fate
when
they
heard
that
blue
jay
had
used
their
father
so
badly
they
were
very
angry
blue
jay
meanwhile
had
become
aware
of
the
arrival
of
two
strangers
and
he
went
to
the
small
house
to
smell
them
out
there
he
espied
the
youths
and
immediately
returned
to
inform
his
chief
of
their
presence
in
the
village
the
chief
then
sent
him
back
to
invite
the
strangers
to
a
shooting
match
but
they
ignored
the
invitation
three
times
blue
jay
made
the
journey
and
at
last
the
youths
looked
upon
him
whereupon
his
hair
immediately
took
fire
he
ran
back
to
his
chief
and
said
oh
these
strangers
are
more
powerful
than
we
are
they
looked
at
me
and
my
hair
caught
fire
the
chief
was
amazed
and
went
down
to
the
beach
to
await
the
arrival
of
the
strangers
when
the
young
men
saw
the
targets
they
would
not
shoot
and
declared
that
they
were
bad
they
immediately
drew
them
out
of
the
ground
and
replaced
them
by
their
own
the
brilliance
of
which
dazzled
the
sight
of
their
opponent
the
chief
was
defeated
he
lost
his
life
and
the
people
were
subdued
the
youths
then
cast
blue
jay
into
the
river
saying
as
they
did
so
green
sturgeon
shall
be
your
name
henceforth
you
shall
not
make
chiefs
miserable
you
shall
sing
and
it
shall
be
a
bad
omen
this
performance
over
they
restored
their
father
from
his
and
spoke
kindly
to
the
mice
saying
oh
you
pitiful
ones
you
shall
eat
everything
that
is
good
you
shall
eat
berries
then
after
establishing
order
in
this
strange
land
they
returned
to
their
home
accompanied
by
their
father
this
curious
story
is
an
example
of
what
is
known
in
mythology
as
the
of
hades
the
land
of
the
supernatural
or
subterranean
beings
always
exercises
a
profound
fascination
over
the
minds
of
barbarians
and
such
tales
are
invented
by
their
for
the
purpose
of
minimizing
the
terrors
which
await
them
when
they
themselves
must
enter
the
strange
country
by
death
the
incident
of
the
glutton
would
seem
to
show
that
two
tales
have
been
amalgamated
a
not
uncommon
circumstance
in
primitive
in
these
stories
the
evil
or
supernatural
power
is
invariably
defeated
and
it
is
touching
to
observe
the
attempts
of
the
savage
to
quench
the
dread
of
death
common
to
all
mankind
by
creating
amusement
at
the
ludicrous
appearance
of
the
dreadful
beings
whom
he
fears
the
sons
of
the
thunderer
are
of
course
whose
effulgence
confounds
the
powers
of
darkness
and
to
some
extent
they
resemble
the
and
xbalanque
of
the
central
american
who
travel
to
the
dark
kingdom
of
xibalba
to
rescue
their
father
and
uncle
and
succeed
in
overthrowing
its
hideous
denizens

taken
from

of

its

ingenuousness
such
a
tale
well
exemplifies
the
difference
of
outlook
between
the
aboriginal
and
the
civilized
mind
and
exhibits
the
many
difficulties
with
which
collectors
of
such
myths
have
to
contend

blue
jay
threw
him
into
the
water
he
tried
to
hold
the
canoe
the
water
reached
up
to
his
armpits
blue
jay
struck
his
hands
until
he
let
go
then
the
boy
cried
and
cried
blue
jay
and
the
other
people
went
away
after
some
time
the
boy
went
up
from
the
beach
he
took
his
arrows
and
walked
round
a
point
of
land
there
he
met
a
young
eagle
and
shot
it
he
skinned
it
and
tried
to
put
the
skin
on
it
was
too
small
it
reached
scarcely
to
his
knees
then
he
took
it
off
and
went
on
after
a
while
he
met
another
eagle
he
shot
it
and
it
fell
down
it
was
a
eagle
he
skinned
it
and
tried
the
skin
on
but
it
was
too
small
it
reached
a
little
below
his
knees
he
took
it
off
left
it
and
went
on
soon
he
met
a
eagle
he
shot
it
twice
and
it
fell
down
he
skinned
it
and
put
the
skin
on
it
was
nearly
large
enough
for
him
and
he
tried
to
fly
he
could
fly
downward
only
he
did
not
rise
he
turned
back
and
now
he
could
fly
now
he
went
round
the
point
seaward
from
nakotat
when
he
had
nearly
gone
round
he
smelled
smoke
of
burning
fat
when
he
came
round
the
point
he
saw
the
people
of
his
town
he
alighted
on
top
of
a
tree
and
looked
down
he
saw
that
they
had
boiled
a
and
that
they
ate
it
when
they
had
nearly
finished
eating
he
flew
up
he
thought
oh
i
wish
blue
jay
would
see
me
then
blue
jay
looked
up
and
saw
the
bird
flying
about
ah
a
bird
came
to
get
food
from
us
five
times
the
eagle
circled
over
the
fire
then
it
descended
blue
jay
took
a
piece
of
blubber
and
said
i
will
give
you
this
to
eat
the
bird
came
down
grasped
the
piece
of
meat
and
flew
away
ha
said
blue
jay
that
bird
has
feet
like
a
man
when
the
people
had
eaten
enough
they
slept
raven
again
hid
a
piece
of
meat
toward
evening
they
awoke
and
ate
again
then
blue
jay
burned
the
rest
of
their
food
in
the
evening
they
gathered
large
and
small
mussels
and
went
home
when
the
boy
came
home
he
lay
down
at
once
they
approached
the
village
and
blue
jay
shouted
fetch
your
mussels
stik
u
a
noise
of
many
feet
was
heard
and
stik
u
a
and
the
other
women
ran
down
to
the
beach
and
carried
up
the
mussels
they
tried
to
rouse
the
boy
but
he
did
not
arise
the
next
morning
the
people
made
themselves
ready
and
launched
their
canoe
the
chief
son
stayed
in
bed
and
did
not
attempt
to
accompany
them
after
sunrise
he
rose
and
called
the
women
and
children
and
said
wash
yourselves
be
quick
the
women
obeyed
and
washed
themselves
he
continued
comb
your
hair
then
he
put
down
a
plank
took
a
piece
of
meat
out
from
under
his
blanket
showed
it
to
the
women
and
said
every
day
your
husbands
eat
this
he
put
two
pieces
side
by
side
on
the
plank
cut
them
to
pieces
and
greased
the
heads
of
all
the
women
and
children
then
he
pulled
the
planks
forming
the
walls
of
the
houses
out
of
the
ground
he
sharpened
them
at
one
end
and
those
which
were
very
wide
he
split
in
two
he
sharpened
all
of
them
the
last
house
of
the
village
was
that
of
the
raven
he
did
not
pull
out
its
he
put
the
planks
on
to
the
backs
of
the
women
and
children
and
said
go
down
to
the
beach
when
you
go
seaward
swim
five
times
round
that
rock
then
go
seaward
when
you
see
you
shall
kill
them
but
you
shall
not
give
anything
to
stingy
people
i
shall
take
these
children
down
they
shall
live
on
the
sea
and
be
my
relatives
then
he
split
sinews
the
women
went
into
the
water
and
began
to
jump
out
of
the
water
they
swam
five
times
back
and
forth
in
front
of
the
village
then
they
went
seaward
to
the
place
where
blue
jay
and
the
men
were
boiling
blue
jay
said
to
the
men
what
is
that
the
men
looked
and
saw
the
girls
jumping
five
times
they
swam
round
blue
jay
rock
then
they
went
seaward
after
a
while
birds
came
flying
to
the
island
their
bills
were
as
red
as
blood
they
followed
the
fish
ah
said
blue
jay
do
you
notice
them
whence
come
these
numerous
birds
the
raven
said
ha
they
are
your
children
do
you
not
recognize
them
five
times
they
went
round
the
rock
now
the
boy
threw
the
sinews
down
upon
the
stones
and
said
when
blue
jay
comes
to
gather
mussels
they
shall
be
fast
to
the
rocks
and
he
said
to
the
women
turning
toward
the
sea
will
be
your
name
when
you
catch
a
whale
you
will
eat
it
but
when
you
catch
a
you
will
throw
it
away
but
you
shall
not
give
anything
to
stingy
people
blue
jay
and
the
people
were
eating
then
that
hunter
said
let
us
go
home
i
am
afraid
we
have
seen
evil
spirits
we
have
never
seen
anything
like
that
on
this
rock
now
they
gathered
mussels
and
carried
along
the
meat
which
they
had
left
over
in
the
evening
they
came
near
their
home
blue
jay
shouted
stik
u
a
fetch
your
mussels
there
was
no
sound
of
people
five
times
he
called
now
the
people
went
ashore
and
they
saw
that
the
walls
of
the
houses
had
disappeared
the
people
cried
blue
jay
cried
also
but
somebody
said
to
him
be
quiet
blue
jay
if
you
had
not
been
bad
our
son
would
not
have
done
so
now
they
all
made
one
house
only
raven
had
one
house
by
himself
he
went
and
searched
for
food
on
the
beach
he
found
a
sturgeon
he
went
again
to
the
beach
and
found
a
porpoise
then
blue
jay
went
to
the
beach
and
tried
to
search
for
food
as
soon
as
he
went
out
it
began
to
hail
the
hailstones
were
so
large
indicating
he
tried
to
gather
mussels
and
wanted
to
break
them
off
but
they
did
not
come
off
he
could
not
break
them
off
he
gave
it
up
raven
went
to
search
on
the
beach
and
found
a
seal
the
others
ate
roots
only
thus
their
chief
took
revenge
on
them
beliefs
of
the
californian
tribes
the
tribes
of
california
afford
a
strange
example
of
racial
conglomeration
speaking
as
they
do
a
variety
of
languages
totally
distinct
from
one
another
and
exhibiting
many
differences
in
physical
appearance
and
custom
concerning
their
mythological
beliefs
bancroft
says
the
californian
tribes
taken
as
a
whole
are
pretty
uniform
in
the
main
features
of
their
theogonic
beliefs
they
seem
without
exception
to
have
had
a
hazy
conception
of
a
lofty
almost
supreme
being
for
the
most
part
referred
to
as
a
great
man
the
old
man
above
the
one
above
attributing
to
him
however
as
is
usual
in
such
cases
nothing
but
the
vaguest
and
most
negative
functions
and
qualities
the
real
practical
power
that
most
interested
them
who
had
most
to
do
with
them
and
they
with
him
was
a
demon
or
body
of
demons
of
a
tolerably
pronounced
character
in
the
face
of
divers
assertions
to
the
effect
that
no
such
thing
as
a
devil
proper
has
ever
been
found
in
savage
mythology
we
would
draw
attention
to
the
following
extract
from
the
tomo
manuscript
of
mr
powers
a
gentleman
who
both
by
his
study
and
by
personal
investigation
has
made
himself
one
of
the
best
qualified
authorities
on
the
belief
of
the
native
californian
and
whose
dealings
have
been
for
the
most
part
with
tribes
that
have
never
had
any
friendly
intercourse
with
white
men
of
course
the
thin
and
meagre
imagination
of
the
american
savages
was
not
equal
to
the
creation
of
milton
magnificent
imperial
satan
or
of
mephistopheles
with
his
subtle
intellect
his
vast
powers
his
malignant
mirth
but
in
so
far
as
the
indian
fiends
or
devils
have
the
ability
they
are
wholly
as
wicked
as
these
they
are
totally
bad
they
have
no
good
thing
in
them
they
think
only
evil
but
they
are
weak
and
undignified
and
absurd
they
are
as
much
beneath
satan
as
the
indians
who
invent
them
are
inferior
in
imagination
to
john
milton
a
definite
location
is
generally
assigned
to
the
evil
one
as
his
favourite
residence
or
resort
thus
the
californians
in
the
county
of
siskiyou
give
over
devil
castle
its
mount
and
lake
to
the
malignant
spirits
and
avoid
the
vicinity
of
these
places
with
all
possible
care
the
coast
tribes
of
del
norte
county
california
live
in
constant
terror
of
a
malignant
spirit
that
takes
the
form
of
certain
animals
the
form
of
a
bat
of
a
hawk
of
a
tarantula
and
so
on
but
especially
delights
in
and
affects
that
of
a
the
belief
of
the
russian
river
tribes
and
others
is
practically
identical
with
this
the
cahrocs
have
some
conception
of
a
great
deity
called
chareya
the
old
man
above
he
is
wont
to
appear
upon
earth
at
times
to
some
of
the
most
favoured
sorcerers
he
is
described
as
wearing
a
close
tunic
with
a
and
as
having
long
white
hair
that
falls
venerably
about
his
shoulders
practically
however
the
cahrocs
like
the
majority
of
californian
tribes
venerate
chiefly
the
coyote
great
dread
is
also
had
of
certain
of
nocturnal
habits
these
say
the
cahrocs
take
the
form
of
bears
and
shoot
arrows
at
benighted
wayfarers
between
the
foregoing
outlines
of
californian
belief
and
those
connected
with
the
remaining
tribes
passing
south
we
can
detect
no
salient
difference
till
we
reach
the
olchones
a
coast
tribe
between
san
francisco
and
monterey
the
sun
here
begins
to
be
connected
or
identified
by
name
with
that
great
spirit
or
rather
that
big
man
who
made
the
earth
and
who
rules
in
the
sky
so
we
find
it
again
both
around
monterey
and
around
san
luis
obispo
the
first
fruits
of
the
earth
were
offered
in
these
neighbourhoods
to
the
great
light
and
his
rising
was
greeted
with
cries
of
joy
father
gerónimo
boscana
gives
us
the
following
account
of
the
faith
and
worship
of
the
acagchemem
tribes
who
inhabit
the
valley
and
neighbourhood
of
san
juan
capistrano
california
we
give
first
the
version
held
by
the
or
highlanders
of
the
interior
country
three
or
four
leagues
inland
from
san
juan
capistrano
before
the
material
world
at
all
existed
there
lived
two
beings
brother
and
sister
of
a
nature
that
can
not
be
explained
the
brother
living
above
and
his
name
meaning
the
heavens
the
sister
living
below
and
her
name
signifying
earth
from
the
union
of
these
two
there
sprang
a
numerous
offspring
earth
and
sand
were
the
of
this
marriage
then
were
born
rocks
and
stones
then
trees
both
great
and
small
then
grass
and
herbs
then
animals
lastly
was
born
a
great
personage
called
ouiot
who
was
a
captain
by
some
unknown
mother
many
children
of
a
medicine
race
were
born
to
this
ouiot
all
these
things
happened
in
the
north
and
afterwards
when
men
were
created
they
were
created
in
the
north
but
as
the
people
multiplied
they
moved
toward
the
south
the
earth
growing
larger
also
and
extending
itself
in
the
same
direction
in
process
of
time
ouiot
becoming
old
his
children
plotted
to
kill
him
alleging
that
the
infirmities
of
age
made
him
unfit
any
longer
to
govern
them
or
attend
to
their
welfare
so
they
put
a
strong
poison
in
his
drink
and
when
he
drank
of
it
a
sore
sickness
came
upon
him
he
rose
up
and
left
his
home
in
the
mountains
and
went
down
to
what
is
now
the
seashore
though
at
that
time
there
was
no
sea
there
his
mother
whose
name
is
the
earth
mixed
him
an
antidote
in
a
large
shell
and
set
the
potion
out
in
the
sun
to
brew
but
the
fragrance
of
it
attracted
the
attention
of
the
coyote
who
came
and
overset
the
shell
so
ouiot
sickened
to
death
and
though
he
told
his
children
that
he
would
shortly
return
and
be
with
them
again
he
has
never
been
seen
since
all
the
people
made
a
great
pile
of
wood
and
burnt
his
body
there
and
just
as
the
ceremony
began
the
coyote
leaped
upon
the
body
saying
that
he
would
burn
with
it
but
he
only
tore
a
piece
of
flesh
from
the
stomach
and
ate
it
and
escaped
after
that
the
title
of
the
coyote
was
changed
from
eyacque
which
means
to
eno
that
is
to
say
thief
and
cannibal
when
now
the
funeral
rites
were
over
a
general
council
was
held
and
arrangements
made
for
collecting
animal
and
vegetable
food
for
up
to
this
time
the
children
and
descendants
of
ouiot
had
nothing
to
eat
but
a
kind
of
white
clay
and
while
they
consulted
together
behold
a
marvellous
thing
appeared
before
them
and
they
spoke
to
it
saying
thou
our
captain
ouiot
but
the
spectre
said
for
i
am
greater
than
ouiot
my
habitation
is
above
and
my
name
is
chinigchinich
then
he
spoke
further
having
been
told
for
what
they
were
come
together
create
all
things
and
i
go
now
to
make
man
another
people
like
unto
you
as
for
you
i
give
you
power
each
after
his
kind
to
produce
all
good
and
pleasant
things
one
of
you
shall
bring
rain
and
another
dew
and
another
make
the
acorn
grow
and
others
other
seeds
and
yet
others
shall
cause
all
kinds
of
game
to
abound
in
the
land
and
your
children
shall
have
this
power
for
ever
and
they
shall
be
sorcerers
to
the
men
i
go
to
create
and
shall
receive
gifts
of
them
that
the
game
fail
not
and
the
harvests
be
sure
then
chinigchinich
made
man
out
of
the
clay
of
the
lake
he
formed
him
male
and
female
and
the
present
californians
are
the
descendants
of
the
one
or
more
pairs
there
and
thus
created
so
ends
the
known
tradition
of
the
mountaineers
we
must
now
go
back
and
take
up
the
story
anew
at
its
beginning
as
told
by
the
or
people
of
the
valley
of
san
juan
capistrano
these
say
that
an
invisible
being
called
nocuma
made
the
world
and
all
that
it
contains
of
things
that
grow
and
move
he
made
it
round
like
a
ball
and
held
it
in
his
hands
where
it
rolled
about
a
good
deal
at
first
till
he
steadied
it
by
sticking
a
heavy
black
rock
called
tosaut
into
it
as
a
kind
of
ballast
the
sea
was
at
this
time
only
a
little
stream
running
round
the
world
and
so
crowded
with
fish
that
their
twinkling
fins
had
no
longer
room
to
move
so
great
was
the
press
that
some
of
the
more
foolish
fry
were
for
effecting
a
landing
and
founding
a
colony
upon
the
dry
land
and
it
was
only
with
the
utmost
difficulty
that
they
were
persuaded
by
their
elders
that
the
killing
air
and
baneful
sun
and
the
want
of
feet
must
infallibly
prove
the
destruction
before
many
days
of
all
who
took
part
in
such
a
desperate
enterprise
the
proper
plan
was
evidently
to
improve
and
enlarge
their
present
home
and
to
this
end
principally
by
the
aid
of
one
very
large
fish
they
broke
the
great
rock
tosaut
in
two
finding
a
bladder
in
the
centre
filled
with
a
very
bitter
substance
the
taste
of
it
pleased
the
fish
so
they
emptied
it
into
the
water
and
instantly
the
water
became
salt
and
swelled
up
and
overflowed
a
great
part
of
the
old
earth
and
made
itself
the
new
boundaries
that
remain
to
this
day
then
nocuma
created
a
man
shaping
him
out
of
the
soil
of
the
earth
calling
him
ejoni
a
woman
also
the
great
god
made
presumably
out
of
the
same
material
as
the
man
calling
her
aé
many
children
were
born
to
this
first
pair
and
their
descendants
multiplied
over
the
land
the
name
of
one
of
these
last
was
sirout
that
is
to
say
handful
of
tobacco
and
the
name
of
his
wife
was
ycaiut
which
means
above
and
to
sirout
and
ycaiut
was
born
a
son
while
they
lived
in
a
place
about
eight
leagues
from
san
juan
capistrano
the
name
of
this
son
was
ouiot
that
is
to
say
dominator
he
grew
a
fierce
and
redoubtable
warrior
haughty
ambitious
tyrannous
he
extended
his
lordship
on
every
side
ruling
everywhere
as
with
a
rod
of
iron
and
the
people
conspired
against
him
it
was
determined
that
he
should
die
by
poison
a
piece
of
the
rock
tosaut
was
ground
up
in
so
deadly
a
way
that
its
mere
external
application
was
sufficient
to
cause
death
ouiot
notwithstanding
that
he
held
himself
constantly
on
the
alert
having
been
warned
of
his
danger
by
a
small
burrowing
animal
called
the
was
unable
to
avoid
his
fate
a
few
grains
of
the
cankerous
mixture
were
dropped
upon
his
breast
while
he
slept
and
the
strong
mineral
ate
its
way
to
the
very
springs
of
his
life
all
the
wise
men
of
the
land
were
called
to
his
assistance
but
there
was
nothing
for
him
save
to
die
his
body
was
burned
on
a
great
pile
with
songs
of
joy
and
dances
and
the
nation
rejoiced
while
the
people
were
gathered
to
this
end
it
was
thought
advisable
to
consult
on
the
feasibility
of
procuring
seed
and
flesh
to
eat
instead
of
the
clay
which
had
up
to
this
time
been
the
sole
food
of
the
human
family
and
while
they
yet
talked
together
there
appeared
to
them
coming
they
knew
not
whence
one
called
attajen
name
implies
man
or
rational
being
and
attajen
understanding
their
desires
chose
out
certain
of
the
elders
among
them
and
to
these
gave
he
power
one
that
he
might
cause
rain
to
fall
to
another
that
he
might
cause
game
to
abound
and
so
with
the
rest
to
each
his
power
and
gift
and
to
the
successors
of
each
for
ever
these
were
the
first
many
years
having
elapsed
since
the
death
of
ouiot
there
appeared
in
the
same
place
one
called
ouiamot
reputed
son
of
tacu
and
auzar
people
unknown
but
natives
it
is
thought
by
boscana
of
some
distant
land
this
ouiamot
is
better
known
by
his
great
name
chinigchinich
which
means
almighty
he
first
manifested
his
powers
to
the
people
on
a
day
when
they
had
met
in
congregation
for
some
purpose
or
other
he
appeared
dancing
before
them
crowned
with
a
kind
of
high
crown
made
of
tall
feathers
stuck
into
a
circlet
of
some
kind
girt
with
a
kind
of
petticoat
of
feathers
and
having
his
flesh
painted
black
and
red
thus
decorated
he
was
called
the
having
danced
some
time
chinigchinich
called
out
the
or
as
they
were
called
among
whom
it
would
appear
the
chiefs
are
always
numbered
and
confirmed
their
power
telling
them
that
he
had
come
from
the
stars
to
instruct
them
in
dancing
and
all
other
things
and
commanding
that
in
all
their
necessities
they
should
array
themselves
in
the
and
so
dance
as
he
had
danced
supplicating
him
by
his
great
name
that
thus
they
might
be
granted
their
petitions
he
taught
them
how
to
worship
him
how
to
build
or
places
of
worship
and
how
to
direct
their
conduct
in
various
affairs
of
life
then
he
prepared
to
die
and
the
people
asked
him
if
they
should
bury
him
but
he
warned
them
against
attempting
such
a
thing
if
ye
buried
me
he
said
ye
would
tread
upon
my
grave
and
for
that
my
hand
would
be
heavy
upon
you
look
to
it
and
to
all
your
ways
for
lo
i
go
up
where
the
high
stars
are
where
mine
eyes
shall
see
all
the
ways
of
men
and
whosoever
will
not
keep
my
commandments
nor
observe
the
things
i
have
taught
behold
disease
shall
plague
all
his
body
and
no
food
shall
come
near
his
lips
the
bear
shall
rend
his
flesh
and
the
crooked
tooth
of
the
serpent
shall
sting
him
in
lower
california
the
pericues
were
divided
into
two
each
of
which
worshipped
a
divinity
which
was
hostile
to
the
other
the
tradition
explains
that
there
was
a
great
lord
in
heaven
called
niparaya
who
made
earth
and
sea
and
was
almighty
and
invisible
his
wife
was
anayicoyondi
a
goddess
who
though
possessing
no
body
bore
him
in
a
divinely
mysterious
manner
three
children
one
of
whom
quaayayp
was
a
real
man
and
born
on
earth
on
the
acaragui
mountains
very
powerful
this
young
god
was
and
for
a
long
time
he
lived
with
the
ancestors
of
the
pericues
whom
it
is
almost
to
be
inferred
that
he
created
at
any
rate
we
are
told
that
he
was
able
to
make
men
drawing
them
up
out
of
the
earth
the
men
at
last
killed
their
great
hero
and
teacher
and
put
a
crown
of
thorns
upon
his
head
somewhere
or
other
he
remains
lying
dead
to
this
day
and
he
remains
constantly
beautiful
neither
does
his
body
know
corruption
blood
drips
constantly
from
his
wounds
and
though
he
can
speak
no
more
being
dead
yet
there
is
an
owl
that
speaks
to
him
the
other
god
was
called
wac
or
tuparan
according
to
the
niparaya
sect
this
wac
had
made
war
on
their
favourite
god
and
had
been
by
him
defeated
and
cast
forth
from
heaven
into
a
cave
under
the
earth
of
which
cave
the
whales
of
the
sea
were
the
guardians
with
a
perverse
though
not
unnatural
obstinacy
the
sect
that
took
wac
or
tuparan
for
their
great
god
persisted
in
holding
ideas
peculiar
to
themselves
with
regard
to
the
truth
of
the
foregoing
story
and
their
account
of
the
great
war
in
heaven
and
its
results
differed
from
the
other
as
differ
the
creeds
of
heterodox
and
orthodox
everywhere
they
ascribe
for
example
part
of
the
creation
to
other
gods
besides
niparaya
myths
of
the
athapascans
the
great
athapascan
family
who
inhabit
a
vast
extent
of
territory
stretching
north
from
the
parallel
nearly
to
the
arctic
ocean
and
westward
to
the
pacific
with
cognate
ramifications
to
the
far
south
are
weak
in
mythological
conceptions
regarding
them
bancroft
says
native
races
of
the
pacific
vol
iii
they
do
not
seem
in
any
of
their
various
tribes
to
have
a
single
expressed
idea
with
regard
to
a
supreme
power
the
loucheux
branch
recognize
a
certain
personage
resident
in
the
moon
whom
they
supplicate
for
success
in
starting
on
a
hunting
expedition
this
being
once
lived
among
them
as
a
poor
ragged
boy
that
an
old
woman
had
found
and
was
bringing
up
and
who
made
himself
ridiculous
to
his
fellows
by
making
a
pair
of
very
large
for
the
people
could
not
see
what
a
starveling
like
him
should
want
with
shoes
of
such
unusual
size
times
of
great
scarcity
troubled
the
hunters
and
they
would
often
have
fared
badly
had
they
not
invariably
on
such
occasions
come
across
a
new
broad
trail
that
led
to
a
head
or
two
of
freshly
killed
game
they
were
glad
enough
to
get
the
game
and
without
scruples
as
to
its
appropriation
still
they
felt
curious
as
to
whence
it
came
and
how
suspicion
at
last
pointing
to
the
boy
and
his
great
shoes
as
being
in
some
way
implicated
in
the
affair
he
was
watched
it
soon
became
evident
that
he
was
indeed
the
benefactor
of
the
loucheux
and
the
secret
hunter
whose
quarry
had
so
often
replenished
their
empty
pots
yet
the
people
were
far
from
being
adequately
grateful
and
continued
to
treat
him
with
little
kindness
or
respect
on
one
occasion
they
refused
him
a
certain
piece
of
fat
him
who
had
so
often
saved
their
lives
by
his
timely
bounty
that
night
the
lad
disappeared
leaving
only
his
clothes
behind
hanging
on
a
tree
he
returned
to
them
in
a
month
however
appearing
as
a
man
and
dressed
as
a
man
he
told
them
that
he
had
taken
up
his
home
in
the
moon
that
he
would
always
look
down
with
a
kindly
eye
to
their
success
in
hunting
but
he
added
that
as
a
punishment
for
their
shameless
greed
and
ingratitude
in
refusing
him
the
piece
of
fat
all
animals
should
be
lean

they

for
this

in
this
regard
than
others
and
are
supported
by

shuts
himself
in

conclusion
in
concluding
this
survey
of
representative
myths
of
the
red
race
of
north
america
the
reader
will
probably
be
chiefly
impressed
with
the
circumstance
that
although
many
of
these
tales
exhibit
a
striking
resemblance
to
the
myths
of
european
and
asiatic
peoples
they
have
yet
an
atmosphere
of
their
own
which
strongly
differentiates
them
from
the
of
all
other
races
it
is
a
truism
in
mythology
that
although
the
tales
and
mythological
systems
of
peoples
dwelling
widely
apart
may
show
much
likeness
to
one
another
such
a
resemblance
can
not
be
advanced
as
a
proof
that
the
divergent
races
at
some
distant
period
possessed
a
common
mythology
certain
tribes
in
borneo
live
in
huts
built
on
piles
driven
into
and
use
so
do
some
indians
of
guiana
and
contiguous
countries
yet
no
scientist
of
experience
would
be
so
rash
as
to
advance
the
theory
that
these
races
possessed
a
common
origin
it
is
the
same
with
mythological
processes
which
may
have
been
evolved
separately
at
great
distances
but
yet
exhibit
a
marked
likeness
these
resemblances
arise
from
the
circumstance
that
the
mind
of
man
whether
he
be
situated
in
china
or
peru
works
on
surprisingly
similar
lines
but
as
has
been
indicated
the
best
proof
that
the
myths
of
north
america
have
not
been
sophisticated
by
those
of
europe
and
asia
is
the
circumstance
that
the
aboriginal
atmosphere
they
contain
is
so
marked
that
even
the
most
superficial
observer
could
not
fail
to
observe
its
presence
in
the
tales
contained
in
this
volume
the
facts
of
indian
life
peculiar
and
unique
enter
into
every
description
and
are
inalienably
interwoven
with
the
matter
of
the
story
in
closing
the
author
desires
to
make
a
strong
appeal
for
a
reasoned
and
charitable
consideration
of
the
indian
character
on
the
part
of
his
readers
this
noble
manly
and
dignified
race
has
in
the
past
been
grossly
maligned
chiefly
by
persons
themselves
ignorant
and
inspired
by
hereditary
dislike
the
red
man
is
neither
a
monster
of
inhumanity
nor
a
marvel
of
cunning
but
a
being
with
like
feelings
and
aspirations
to
our
own
because
his
customs
and
habits
of
thought
differ
from
ours
he
has
been
charged
with
all
manner
of
crimes
and
offences
with
which
he
has
in
general
nothing
to
do
we
do
not
deny
that
he
was
till
very
recent
times
a
savage
with
the
habits
and
outlook
of
a
savage
but
that
he
ever
was
a
demon
in
human
shape
must
be
strenuously
denied
in
the
march
of
progress
indian
men
and
women
are
taking
places
of
honour
and
emolument
side
by
side
with
their
white
and
many
gifted
and
cultured
persons
of
indian
blood
have
done
good
work
for
the
race
let
us
hope
that
the
ancient
virtues
of
courage
and
endurance
which
have
stood
the
indian
people
in
such
good
stead
of
old
will
assist
their
descendants
in

even
more
strenuous

note
on
pronunciation
workers
in
indian
mythology
and
linguistics
have
in
some
instances
created
a
phonology
of
their
own
for
the
several
languages
in
which
they
wrought
but
generally
speaking
the
majority
of
indian
names
both
of
places
and
individuals
should
be
pronounced
as
spelt
the
spelling
being
that
of
persons
used
to
transcribing
native
diction
and
as
a
rule
representing
the

harshness

scanty
as
is
often
mistakenly
supposed
and
their
grammatical
structure
is

the
commonest
traits
in
american
languages
are
the
vagueness
of
demarcation
between
the
noun
and
verb
the
use
of
the
intransitive
form
of
the
verb
for
the

the
compound
character
of

pronouns
a
