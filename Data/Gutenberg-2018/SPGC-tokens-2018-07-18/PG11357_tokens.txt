one
look

there
is

may

me

my

said
go
to
jerusalem
i
went
that
was
in
i
had
been
there
a
couple
of
times
before
the
world
war
when
the
turks
were
in
full
control
so
i
knew
about
the
bedbugs
and
the
stench
of
the
citadel
moat
the
price
of
camels
enough
arabic
to
misunderstand
it
when
spoken
fluently
and
enough
of
the
old
testament
and
the
koran
to
guess
at
arabian
motives
which
are
important
whereas
words
are
usually
such
stuff
as
lies
are
made
of
el
kudz
as
arabs
call
jerusalem
is
from
a
certain
distance
as
they
also
call
it
shellabi
kabir
extremely
beautiful
beautiful
upon
a
mountain
el
kudz
means
the
city
and
in
a
certain
sense
it
is
that
to
unnumbered
millions
of
people
ludicrous
uproarious
dignified
pious
sinful
naively
confidential
secretive
altruistic
realistic
and
very
very
proud
of
its
name
jerusalem
which
means
city
of
peace
full
to
the
brim
with
the
malice
of
certainly
fifty
religions
fifty
races
and
five
hundred
thousand
curious
political
chicaneries
disguised
as
plans

our
souls
from

full
look
for
a
man
named
grim
said
my
employer
james
schuyler
grim
american
aged
or
so
i
heard
he
knows
the
ropes
the
ropes
when
i
was
in
jerusalem
before
the
war
were
principally
used
for
hanging
people
at
the
jaffa
gate
after
they
had
been
well
beaten
on
the
soles
of
their
feet
to
compel
them
to
tell
where
their
money
was
hidden
the
turks
entirely
understood
the
arts
of
suppression
and
extortion
which
they
defined
as
government
the
british
on
the
other
hand
subject
their
normal
human
impulse
to
be
greedy
and
their
educated
craving
to
be
gentlemanly
white
man
to
a
process
of
compromise
perhaps
that
is
government
but
it
works
they
even
carry
compromise
to
the
point
of
not
hanging
even
their
critics
if
they
can
possibly
avoid
doing
it
they
had
not
yet
but
they
were
about
to
receive
a
mandate
from
a
league
of
nations
awkwardly
qualified
by
promise
to
the
zionists
to
give
the
country
to
the
jews
and
by
a
promise
in
which
the
french
had
joined
to
create
an
arab
kingdom
for
the
arabs
so
there
was
lots
of
compromising
being
done
and
hell
to
pay
with
no
one
paying
except
of
course
the
guests
in
the
hotels
at
new
york
prices
the
zionist
jews
were
arriving
in
droves
the
arabs
who
owned
most
of
the
land
were
threatening
to
cut
all
the
jews
throats
as
soon
as
they
could
first
get
all
their
money
feisal
a
descendant
of
the
prophet
who
had
fought
gloriously
against
the
turks
was
romantically
getting
ready
in
damascus
to
be
crowned
king
of
syria
the
french
who
pride
themselves
on
being
realistic
were
getting
ready
to
go
after
feisal
with
bayonets
and
as
they
eventually
did
in
jerusalem
the
bolsheviks
astonishingly
credulous
of
secret
news
from
moscow
and
skeptical
of
every
one

their

arrogant
innocence
that
even

mustapha

i
arrived
in
the
midst
of
all
that
and
spent
a
couple
of
months
trying
to
make
head
or
tail
of
it
and
wondering
if
that
was
peace
what
war
is
they
say
that
wherever
a
man
was
ever
slain
in
palestine
a
flower
grows
so
one
gets
a
fair
idea
of
the
country
without
much
difficulty
for
three
months
of
the
year
from
end
to
end
the
whole
landscape
is
carpeted
with
flowers
so
close
together
that
except
where
beasts
and
men
have
trodden
winding
tracks
one
can
hardly
walk
without
crushing
an
anemone
or
wild
chrysanthemum
there
are
more
in
that
small
land
than
all
europe
can
show
there
are
streams
everywhere
that
historians
assert
repeatedly
ran
blood
for
days
five
thousand
years
of
bloody
terrorism
intermingling
of
races
piety
plunder
politics
and
pilgrims
have
produced
a
consciousness
as
concentrated
as
liquid
the
laughter
is
sarcastic
the
humour
sardonic
and
the
credulity
beyond
analysis
for
instance
when
i
got
there
i
heard
the
british
being
accused
of
imperialistic
savagery
because
they
had
removed
the
leprous
beggars
from
the
streets
into
a
clean
place
where
they
could
receive
medical
treatment
it
was
difficult
to
find
one
line
of
observation
whatever
anybody
told
you
was
reversed
entirely
by
the
next
man
the
obligation
to
study
arabic
called
for
rather
intimate
association
with
educated
arabs
whose
main
obsession
was
fear
of
the
zionist
jews
the
things
they
said
against
the
jews
turned
me
so
i
cautiously
made
the
acquaintance
of
some
gentlemen
with
spectacles
and
the
things
they
said
about
the
arabs
set
me
to
sympathizing
with
the
sons
of
ishmael
again
in
the
midst
of
that
predicament
i
met
jimgrim
major
james
schuyler
grim
to
give
him
his
full
title
although
hardly
any
one
ever
called
him
by
it
after
that
bewilderment
began
to
cease
as
under
his
amused
painstaking
fingers
thread
after
thread
of
the
involved
gnarl
of
plots
and
politics
betrayed
its
course
however
first
i
must
tell
how
i
met
him
there
is
an
american
colony
in
jerusalem
a
community
concern
that
runs
a
store
and
is
even
more
savagely
criticized
than
the
british
administration
as
is
only
natural
the
story
of
what
they
did
in
the
war
is
a
epic
you
ca
be
epic
and
not
make
enemies
a
chicago
jew
assured
me
they
were
swine
and
but
i
learned
that
the
yemen
jews
prayed
for
them
first
prayer
every
sabbath
of
the
year
calling
down
blessings
on
their
heads
for
charitable
service
rendered
one
hardly
goes
all
the
way
to
palestine
to
meet
americans
but
a
journalist
ca
afford
to
be
wilfully
ignorant
a
british
official
assured
me
they
were
good
blokes
and
an
armenian
told
me
they
could
skin
fleas
for
their
hides
and
tallow
but
the
armenian
was
wearing
a
good
suit
and
eating
good
food
which
he
admitted
had
been
given
to
him
by
the
american
colony
he
was
bitter
with
them
because
they
had
refused
to
cash
a
draft
on
mosul
drawn
on
a
bank
that
had
ceased
to
exist
it
seemed
a
good
idea
to
call
on
the
american
colony
at
their
store
near
the
jaffa
gate
and
it
turned
out
to
be
a
very
clean
spot
in
a
dirty
city
i
taxed
their
generosity
and
sat
for
hours
on
a
pile
of
asian
rugs
behind
the
store
and
whatever
i
have
missed
and
lost
or
squandered
at
least
i
know
their
story
and
can
keep
it
until
the
proper
time
of
course
you
have
to
allow
for
point
of
view
just
as
the
mariner
allows
for
variation
and
deviation
but
when
they
inferred
that
most
of
the
constructive
good
that
has
come
to
the
near
east
in
the
last
fifty
years
has
been
american
they
spoke
with
the
authority
of
men
who
have
lived
on
the
spot
and
watched
it
happen
you
see
the
americans
who
have
come
here
have
set
up
governments
they
opened
schools
and
colleges
poured
in
education
and
taken
nothing
then
there
are
thousands
of
arabs
living
in
hovels
because
there
nothing
better
who
have
been
to
america
and
brought
back
memories
with
them
all
that
accounts
for
the
desire
for
an
american
mandate
which
would
be
a
very
bad
thing
though
because
the
moment
we
set
up
a
government
we
would
lose
our
chance
to
be
disinterested
the
country
is
better
off
under
any
other
mandate
provided
it
gives
americans
the
right
to
teach
without
ruling
america
mission
is
educational
there
an
american
though
who
might
seem
to
prove
the
contrary
do
you
see
him
there
were
two
arabs
in
the
room
talking
in
low
tones
over
by
the
window
i
could
imagine
the
smaller
of
the
two
as
a
peddler
of
lace
and
in
the
states
who
had
taken
out
papers
for
the
sake
of
privilege
and
returned
full
of
notions
to
exploit
his
motherland
but
the
tall
one
never
he
was
a
bedouin
if
ever
a
son
of
the
desert
breathed
if
he
had
visited
the
states
then
he
had
come
back
as
unchanged
as
gold
out
of
an
acid
bath
and
as
for
being
born
there
that
little
fellow
may
be
an
american
i
said
in
fact
of
course
he
is
since
you
say
so
but
as
for
being
up
to
any
good
you
mistaken
you
looking
at
the
wrong
man
observe
the
other
one
i
was
more
than
ever
sure
i
was
not
mistaken
stately
gesture
dignity
complexion
attitude
to
say
nothing
of
his
bedouin
array
and
the
steadiness
with
which
he
kept
his
dark
eyes
fixed
on
the
smaller
man
he
was
talking
to
had
laid
the
stamp
of
the
desert
on
the
taller
man
from
head
to
heel
that
tall
man
is
an
american
officer
in
the
british
army
does
look
the
part
eh
they
say
he
was
the
first
american
to
be
granted
a
commission
without
any
pretense
of
his
being
a
canadian
they
accepted
him
as
an
american
it
was
a
case
of
that
or
nothing
lived
here
for
years
and
knew
the
country
so
well
that
they
felt
they
had
to
have
him
on
his
own
terms
you
can
believe
anything
in
jerusalem
after
you
have
been
in
the
place
a
week
or
two
so
seeing
who
my
informant
was
i
swallowed
the
fact
but
it
was
a
marvel
it
seemed
even
greater
when
the
man
strolled
out
pausing
to
salute
my
host
with
the
solemn
politeness
that
warfare
with
the
desert
breeds
you
could
not
imagine
that
at
ellis
island
or
on
broadway
even
on
the
stage
it
was
too
untheatrical
to
be
acting
too
individual
to
be
imitation
to
to
have
been
acquired
i
hazarded
a
guess
a
red
man
then
carlisle
for
education
swallowed
again
by
the
first
desert
he
stayed
in
for
more
than
a
week
wrong
his
name
is
grim
sounds
like
scandinavian
ancestry
on
one
side
james
schuyler
grim
dutch
then
on
the
other
and
some
english
ten
generations
in
the
states
at
any
rate
he
can
tell
you
all
about
this
country
why
not
call
on
him
it
did
not
need
much
intelligence
to
agree
to
that
suggestion
but
the
british
military
take
their
code
with
them
to
the
uttermost
ends
of
earth
behind
which
they
wonder
why
so
many
folks
with
different
codes
or
none
dislike
them
write
me
an
introduction
i
said
you
wo
need
one
just
call
on
him
he
lives
at
a
place
they
call
the
junior
staff
officers
mess
up
beyond
the
russian
convent
and
below
the
zionist
hospital
so
i
went
that
evening
finding
the
way
with
difficulty
because
they
talk
at
least
eighteen
languages
in
jerusalem
and
with
the
exception
of
official
residences
no
names
were
posted
anywhere
that
was
not
an
official
residence
it
was
a
sort
of
communal
improvised
by
a
dozen
or
so
officers
in
preference
to
the
inconvenience
of
tents
in
a
therefore
enemy
property
stone
house
at
the
end
of
an
alley
in
a
garden
full
of
blooming
pomegranates
i
sent
my
card
in
by
a
old
russian
female
who
ran
down
passages
and
round
corners
like
a
wet
hen
trying
to
find
a
the
place
seemed
deserted
but
presently
she
came
on
her
quarry
in
the
back
yard
and
a
very
small
boy
in
a
tarboosh
and
knickerbockers
carried
the
card
on
a
tray
into
a
room
on
the
left
through
the
open
door
i
could
hear
one
quiet
question
and
a
disclaimer
of
all
knowledge
then
an
order
sounding
like
a
grumble
and
the
small
boy
returned
to
the
hall
to
invite
me
in
in
reasonably
good
english
of
which
he
seemed
prouder
than
i
of
my
arabic
so
i
went
into
the
room
on
the
left
with
that
bedouin
still
in
mind
there
was
only
one
man
in
there
who
got
out
of
a
deep
armchair
as
i
entered
marking
his
place
in
a
book
with
a
damascus
dagger
he
did
not
look
much
more
than
middle
height
nor
more
than
medium
dark
complexioned
and
he
wore
a
khaki
uniform
beg
pardon
i
said
i
disturbed
the
wrong
man
i
came
to
call
on
an
american
named
major
grim
i
grim
must
be
a
mistake
though
the
man
i
looking
for
is
taller
than
you
very
dark
looks
walks
speaks
and
acts
like
a
bedouin
i
saw
him
this
afternoon
in
bedouin
costume
in
the
american
colony
store
yes
i
noticed
you
sit
down
wo
you
yes
i
he
the
bedouin
seems
to
add
to
a
man
height
soap
and
water
account
for
the
rest
of
it
these
cigars
are
from
the
states
outer
cloak
it
was
hard
to
believe
even
on
the
strength
of
his
straight
statement
he
talking
undisguised
american
and
smiling
at
me
no
doubt
vastly
pleased
with
my
incredulity
are
you
a
case
of
jekyll
and
hyde
i
asked
no
i
more
like
both
sides
of
a
sandwich
with
some
army
meat
in
the
middle
but
i
wo
be
interviewed
i
hate
it
besides
it
against
the
regulations
his
voice
was
not
quite
so
harshly
nasal
as
those
of
the
middle
west
but
he
had
not
picked
up
the
drawl
and
consonants
that
so
many
americans
affect
abroad
and
overdo
i
do
think
a
wise
crook
would
have
chosen
him
as
a
subject
for
experiments
he
had
dark
eyes
with
noticeably
long
lashes
heavy
eyebrows
what
the
army
describe
as
a
medium
chin
rather
large
hands
with
long
straight
fingers
and
feet
such
as
an
athlete
stands
on
fully
big
for
his
size
but
well
shaped
he
was
young
for
a
major
somewhere
between
thirty
and
once
he
was
satisfied
that
i
would
not
write
him
up
for
the
newspapers
he
showed
no
disinclination
to
talk
although
it
was
difficult
to
keep
him
on
the
subject
of
himself
and
easy
to
let
him
lose
you
in
a
maze
of
tribal
history
he
seemed
to
know
the
ins
and
outs
of
every
from
beersheba
to
damascus
and
warmed
to
his
subject
as
you
listened
you
see
he
said
by
way
of
apology
when
i
laughed
at
a
string
of
names
that
to
me
conjured
up
only
confusion
my
beat
is
all
the
way
from
cairo
to
aleppo
both
sides
of
the
jordan
i
not
on
the
regular
strength
but
attached
to
the
intelligence
no
not
permanent
do
know
what
the
future
has
in
store
that
probably
depends
on
whether
or
not
the
zionists
get
full
control
and
how
soon
meanwhile
i
my
own
boss
more
or
less
report
direct
to
the
administrator
and
he
one
of
those
men
who
allows
you
lots
of
scope
that
was
the
sort
of
occasional
glimpse
he
gave
of
himself
and
then
switched
off
into
straight
statements
about
the
zionist
problem
all
his
statements
were
unqualified
and
given
with
the
air
of
knowing
all
about
it
right
from
the
beginning
there
nothing
here
that
really
matters
outside
the
arab
problem
but
that
a
big
one
people
do
realize
it
even
on
the
spot
but
it
a
world
movement
with
ramifications
everywhere
all
the
other
politics
of
the
near
east
hinge
on
it
even
when
it
does
appear
so
on
the
surface
you
see
the
jews
have
international
affiliations
through
banks
and
commerce
they
have
everywhere
a
ripple
here
may
mean
a
wave
in
russia
or
london
or
new
york
i
known
at
least
one
arab
over
here
that
began
with
a
quarrel
between
a
jew
and
a
christian
in
chicago
are
the
zionists
as
dangerous
as
the
arabs
seem
to
think
i
asked
yes
and
no
depends
what
you
call
danger
they
like
an
incoming
tide
all
you
can
do
is
accept
the
fact
and
ride
on
top
of
it
move
away
in
front
of
it
or
go
under
the
arabs
want
to
push
it
back
with
ca
be
done
speaking
as
a
mere
onlooker
i
feel
sorry
for
the
arabs
i
said
it
has
been
their
country
for
several
hundred
years
they
did
even
drive
the
jews
out
of
it
the
romans
attended
to
that
after
the
assyrians
and
babylonians
had
cleaned
up
of
the
population
and
at
that
the
jews
were
invaders
themselves
sure
grim
answered
but
you
ca
argue
with
tides
the
arabs
are
sore
and
nobody
has
any
right
to
blame
them
the
english
betrayed
the
arabs
i
do
mean
the
fellows
out
here
but
the
gang
at
the
foreign
office
i
glanced
at
his
uniform
that
was
a
strange
statement
coming
from
a
man
who
wore
it
he
understood
and
laughed
oh
the
men
out
here
all
admit
it
they
as
sore
as
the
arabs
are
themselves
then
you
on
the
wrong
side
and
you
know
it
i
suggested
the
meat
he
said
is
in
the
middle
of
the
sandwich
in
a
small
way
you
might
say
i
a
doctor
staying
on
after
a
riot
to
stitch
up
cuts
the
quarrel
was
none
of
my
making
although
i
was
in
it
and
did
what
i
could
to
help
against
the
turks
like
everybody
else
who
knows
them
i
admire
the
turks
and
hate
what
they
stand
for
hate
their
cruelty
i
was
with
lawrence
across
the
jordan
went
all
the
way
to
damascus
with
him
saw
the
war
through
to
a
finish
in
case
you
choose
to
call
it
finished
vainly
i
tried
to
pin
him
down
to
personal
reminiscences
he
was
not
interested
in
his
own
story
the
british
promised
old
king
hussein
of
mecca
that
if
raise
an
arab
army
to
use
against
the
turks
there
should
be
a
united
arab
kingdom
afterward
under
a
ruler
of
their
own
choosing
the
kingdom
was
to
include
syria
arabia
and
palestine
the
french
agreed
well
the
arabs
raised
the
army
emir
feisul
king
hussein
third
son
commanded
it
lawrence
did
so
well
that
he
became
a
legend
the
result
was
allenby
could
concentrate
his
army
on
this
side
of
the
jordan
and
clean
up
he
made
a
good
job
of
it
the
arabs
were
naturally
i
suggested
that
the
arabs
with
that
great
army
could
have
enforced
the
contract
but
he
laughed
again
they
were
being
paid
in
gold
by
the
british
and
had
lawrence
to
hold
them
together
the
flow
of
gold
stopped
and
lawrence
was
sent
home
somebody
at
the
foreign
office
had
changed
his
mind
you
see
they
were
all
taken
by
surprise
at
the
speed
of
allenby
campaign
the
zionists
saw
their
chance
and
claimed
palestine
no
doubt
they
had
money
and
influence
perhaps
it
was
jewish
gold
that
had
paid
the
wages
of
the
arab
army
anyhow
the
french
laid
claim
to
syria
by
the
time
the
war
was
over
the
zionists
had
a
guarantee
the
french
claim
to
syria
had
been
admitted
and
there
was
any
country
left
except
some
arabian
desert
to
let
the
arabs
have
that
the
situation
feisul
is
in
damascus
going
through
the
farce
of
being
proclaimed
king
with
the
french
holding
the
and
getting
ready
to
oust
him
the
zionists
are
in
jerusalem
working
like
beavers
and
the
british
are
getting
ready
to
pull
out
as
much
as
possible
and
leave
the
zionists
to
do
their
own
worrying
mesopotamia
is
in
a
state
of
more
or
less
anarchy
egypt
is
like
a
full
of
explosive
may
go
off
any
minute
the
arabs
would
like
to
challenge
the
world
to
mortal
combat
and
then
fight
one
another
while
the
rest
of
the
world
pays
the
bill
and
you
the
french
for
instance
their
army
is
weak
at
the
moment
they
neither
men
nor
money
only
a
hunger
to
own
syria
they
do
play
what
the
english
call
side
they
play
a
mean
game
the
french
general
staff
figure
that
if
feisul
should
attack
them
now
he
might
beat
them
so
they
conceived
the
brilliant
idea
of
spreading
sedition
and
every
kind
of
political
discontent
into
palestine
and
across
the
jordan
so
that
if
the
arabs
make
an
effort
they
make
it
simultaneously
in
both
countries
then
the
british
being
in
the
same
mess
with
the
french
would
have
to
take
the
french
side
and
make
a
joint
campaign
of
it
but
do
the
british
know
this
you
bet
they
know
it
what
the
intelligence
for
the
french
are
hiring
all
the
arab
newspapers
to
preach
against
the
british
a
child
could
see
it
with
his
eyes
shut
then
why
in
thunder
do
the
british
have
a
showdown
that
where
the
joker
comes
in
the
french
know
there
a
sort
of
diplomatic
credo
at
the
london
foreign
office
to
the
general
effect
that
england
and
france
have
got
to
stand
together
or
europe
will
go
to
pieces
the
french
are
realists
they
bank
on
that
they
tread
on
british
corns
out
here
all
they
want
to
while
they
toss
bouquets
backed
by
airplanes
across
the
english
channel
then
the
war
did
end
the
old
diplomacy
what
a
question
but
i
have
more
than
scratched
the
near
east
surface
for
you
yet
there
mustapha
kemal
in
anatolia
leader
of
the
turkish
nationalists
no
more
dead
or
incapacitated
than
a
possum
he
playing
for
his
own
hand
kaiser
willy
stuff
studying
trotzky
and
lenin
and
flirting
with
party
on
the
side
then
there
a
bolshevist
element
among
the
zionists
got
teeth
too
there
an
effort
being
made
from
india
to
intrigue
among
the
sikh
troops
employed
in
palestine
there
a
very
strong
party
yelling
for
an
american
mandate
the
armenians
poor
devils
are
pulling
any
string
they
can
get
hold
of
in
the
hope
that
anything
at
all
may
happen
the
orthodox
jews
are
against
the
zionists
the
arabs
are
against
them
both
and
furious
with
one
another
there
a
movement
on
foot
and
a
both
different
and
opposed
about
per
cent
of
the
british
are
as
as
they
dare
be
but
the
rest
are
strong
for
the
zionists
and
the
neutral
strong
for
law
and
order
but
taking
no
sides
and
you
i
one
of
the
men
who
is
trying
to
keep
the
peace
he
invited
me
to
stay
to
dinner
the
other
members
of
the
mess
were
trooping
in
all
his
juniors
all
obviously
fond
of
him
and
boisterously
irreverent
of
his
rank
dinner
under
his
chairmanship
was
a
sort
of
school
for
repartee
it
was
utterly
unlike
the
usual
british
mess
dinner
if
you
shut
your
eyes
for
a
minute
you
could
believe
that
any
one
present
had
ever
worn
a
uniform
i
learned
afterward
that
there
was
quite
a
little
competition
to
get
into
that
mess
after
dinner
most
of
them
trooped
out
again
to
dance
with
zionist
ladies
at
an
institute
affair
but
he
and
i
stayed
and
talked
until
midnight
before
i
left
the
key
of
palestine
and
syria
was
in
my
hands
you
seem
interested
he
said
coming
with
me
to
the
door
if
you
do
mind
rough
spots
now
and
then
i
try
to
show
you
a
few
things
at
first
hand
chapter
two
no
objection
only
a
stipulation
the
showmanship
began
much
sooner
than
i
hoped
the
following
day
was
sunday
and
i
had
an
invitation
to
a
sort
of
tea
given
by
the
american
colony
after
their
afternoon
religious
service
they
received
their
guests
in
a
huge
room
on
the
upper
floor
of
a
stone
house
built
around
a
courtyard
filled
with
flowers
i
think
they
were
a
little
proud
of
the
number
of
arabs
who
had
traveled
long
distances
in
order
to
be
present
ten
arab
chieftains
in
full
costume
with
fifteen
or
twenty
of
their
followers
all
there
at
great
expense
of
trouble
time
and
money
for
friends
sake
were
after
all
something
to
feel
a
bit
chesty
about
every
member
of
the
colony
seemed
able
to
talk
arabic
like
a
native
and
as
they
used
to
say
in
the
state
papers
a
good
time
was
being
had
by
all
the
near
east
adores
and
there
was
lots
of
it
two
of
the
arab
chiefs
were
christians
the
rest
were
not
the
peace
and
war
record
of
the
colony
was
what
had
brought
them
all
there
hardly
an
arab
in
the
country
was
not
the
colony
debtor
for
disinterested
help
direct
or
indirect
at
some
time
in
some
way
the
american
colony
was
the
one
place
in
the
country
where
a
man
of
any
creed
could
go
and
be
sure
that
whatever
he
might
say
would
not
be
used
against
him
so
they
were
talking
their
heads
off
hot
air
and
arab
politics
have
quite
a
lot
in
common
but
there
was
a
broad
about
it
all
it
was
like
the
little
gusty
yaps
you
hear
in
the
city
a
lot
of
the
talk
was
foolish
but
it
was
all
magnificent
there
was
one
sheikh
named
mustapha
ben
nasir
dressed
in
a
blue
serge
suit
and
boots
with
nothing
to
show
his
nationality
except
a
striped
silk
with
the
band
around
the
forehead
he
was
a
handsome
fellow
with
a
black
beard
trimmed
to
a
point
and
perfect
manners
polished
no
doubt
in
a
dozen
countries
but
still
eastern
in
slow
deferential
dignity
he
could
talk
good
french
i
fell
in
conversation
with
him
the
frankness
with
which
treason
is
mooted
admitted
and
discussed
in
the
near
east
is
one
of
the
first
things
that
amaze
you
they
are
so
open
about
it
that
nobody
takes
them
seriously
apparently
it
is
only
when
they
do
talk
treason
openly
that
the
ruling
authorities
get
curious
and
make
arrests
to
me
a
total
stranger
with
nothing
to
recommend
me
but
that
for
an
hour
or
two
that
afternoon
i
was
a
guest
of
the
american
colony
mustapha
ben
nasir
made
no
bones
whatever
about
the
fact
that
the
was
being
paid
by
the
french
to
stir
up
feeling
over
jordan
against
the
british
i
receive
a
monthly
salary
he
boasted
i
am
just
from
damascus
where
the
french
paid
me
and
gave
me
some
instructions
where
is
your
home
i
asked
him
at
in
the
mountains
of
moab
across
the
dead
sea
i
start
this
evening
will
you
come
with
me
je
bien
garderai
he
smiled
myself
i
am
in
favor
of
the
british
the
french
pay
my
expenses
that
is
all
what
we
all
want
is
an
independent
arab
government
some
say
kingdom
some
say
republic
if
it
is
not
time
for
that
yet
then
we
would
choose
an
american
mandate
but
america
has
deserted
us
failing
america
we
prefer
the
english
for
the
present
anything
except
france
we
do
not
want
to
become
a
new
algeria
what
is
the
condition
now
at
condition
there
is
none
there
is
chaos
you
see
the
british
say
their
authority
ceases
at
the
river
jordan
and
at
a
line
drawn
down
the
middle
of
the
dead
sea
that
leaves
us
with
a
choice
between
two
other
governments
king
hussein
government
of
mecca
and
feisul
in
syria
but
hussein
arm
is
not
long
enough
to
reach
us
from
the
south
and
feisul
is
not
nearly
strong
enough
to
interfere
from
the
north
so
there
is
no
government
and
each
man
is
keeping
the
peace
with
his
own
sword
you
mean
each
man
on
his
own
account
yes
so
there
is
peace
five
fifteen
thirty
throats
are
cut
daily
and
if
you
go
down
to
the
jordan
and
listen
you
will
hear
the
shots
being
fired
from
ambush
any
day
and
you
invite
me
to
make
the
trip
with
you
oh
that
is
nothing
in
the
first
place
you
are
american
nobody
will
interfere
with
an
american
they
are
welcome
in
the
second
place
there
is
a
good
reason
for
bringing
you
we
all
want
an
american
school
at
but
i
am
no
teacher
but
you
will
be
returning
to
america
it
is
enough
then
that
you
look
the
situation
over
and
tell
what
you
know
on
your
return
we
will
provide
a
building
a
proper
salary
and
guarantee
the
teacher
life
we
would
prefer
a
woman
but
it
would
be
wisest
to
send
a
man
how
so
the
woman
might
not
shoot
straight
i
some
of
our
western
women
do
tricks
with
a
gun
that
would
there
would
be
no
need
she
would
have
our
word
of
honour
but
every
sheikh
who
has
only
three
wives
would
want
to
make
her
his
fourth
a
man
would
be
best
will
you
come
with
me
on
your
single
undertaking
to
protect
me
are
you
king
of
all
that
countryside
if
you
will
come
you
shall
have
an
escort
every
man
of
whom
will
die
before
he
would
let
you
be
killed
and
if
they
and
you
should
all
be
killed
their
sons
and
grandsons
would
avenge
you
to
the
third
generation
of
your
murderers
that
undoubtedly
handsome
but
believe
me
effendi
he
urged
many
a
soul
has
been
consoled
in
by
the
knowledge
that
his
adversaries
would
be
cut
off
in
their
prime
by
friends
who
are
true
to
their
given
word
meaning
to
back
out
politely
i
assured
him
i
would
think
the
offer
over
well
and
good
he
answered
you
have
my
promise
should
you
decide
to
come
leave
word
here
with
the
american
colony
they
will
get
word
to
me
then
i
will
send
for
you
and
the
escort
shall
meet
you
at
the
dead
sea
i
talked
it
over
with
two
or
three
members
of
the
colony
and
they
assured
me
the
promise
could
be
depended
on
one
of
them
added
besides
you
ought
to
see
it
an
old
crusader
city
rather
ruined
but
more
or
less
the
way
the
crusaders
left
it
and
that
craving
of
theirs
for
a
school
is
worth
doing
something
about
if
you
ever
have
an
opportunity
they
say
they
have
too
much
religion
already
and
no
enlightenment
at
all
a
teacher
who
knew
arabic
would
have
a
time
and
would
be
well
paid
and
protected
if
he
could
keep
his
hands
off
politics
why
not
talk
with
major
grim
it
was
a
walk
to
grim
place
but
i
had
the
good
fortune
to
catch
him
in
again
he
was
sitting
in
the
same
chair
studying
the
same
book
and
this
time
i
saw
the
title
of
it
walter
pater
marius
the
epicurean
a
strange
book
for
a
soldier
to
be
reading
and
cutting
its
pages
with
an
inlaid
dagger
in
a
jerusalem
but
he
was
a
man
of
unexpectedly
assorted
moods
he
laughed
when
i
told
of
ben
nasir
he
looked
serious
when
i
mooted
serious
then
interested
them
speculative
from
where
i
sat
i
could
watch
the
changes
in
his
eyes
what
would
the
escort
amount
to
i
asked
him
absolute
security
and
what
this
bunk
about
americans
being
welcome
anywhere
perfectly
true
all
the
way
from
aleppo
down
to
beersheba
men
like
have
made
such
an
impression
that
an
occasional
rotter
might
easily
take
advantage
of
it
americans
in
this
country
so
far
stand
for
altruism
without
ulterior
motive
if
we
accepted
the
mandate
they
might
have
found
us
out
meanwhile
an
american
is
safe
of
the
american
college
at
beirut
died
probably
more
respected
throughout
the
near
east
than
any
ten
men
of
any
other
nationality
then
i
think
i
go
to
again
his
eyes
grew
speculative
i
could
not
tell
whether
he
was
considering
me
or
some
problem
of
his
own
speaking
unofficially
he
said
there
are
two
possibilities
you
might
go
without
permission
easy
enough
provided
you
talk
beforehand
in
that
case
you
get
there
and
back
after
which
the
administration
would
label
and
index
you
the
remainder
of
your
stay
in
palestine
would
be
about
as
exciting
as
pushing
a
perambulator
in
prospect
park
brooklyn
be
canned
i
rather
be
killed
what
the
alternative
get
permission
i
shall
be
at
myself
within
the
next
few
days
i
think
it
can
be
arranged
mean
i
can
go
with
you
i
asked
as
eager
as
a
schoolboy
for
the
circus
not
on
your
life
i
do
go
as
an
american
recalling
the
first
time
i
had
seen
him
i
sat
still
and
tried
to
look
like
a
person
who
was
not
thrilled
in
the
least
by
seeing
secrets
from
the
inside
well
i
said
i
in
your
hands
i
think
he
rather
liked
that
as
i
came
to
know
him
more
intimately
later
on
he
revealed
an
iron
delight
in
being
trusted
but
he
did
not
say
another
word
for
several
minutes
as
if
there
were
maps
in
his
mind
that
he
was
conning
before
reaching
a
decision
then
he
spoke
suddenly
are
you
busy
he
asked
then
come
with
me
he
phoned
to
some
place
or
other
for
a
staff
automobile
and
the
man
was
there
with
it
within
three
minutes
we
piled
in
and
drove
at
totally
unholy
speed
down
narrow
streets
between
walls
around
blind
turns
where
arab
policemen
stood
waving
unintelligible
signals
and
up
the
mount
of
olives
past
the
british
military
to
the
place
they
call
oeta
the
kaiser
had
it
built
to
command
every
view
of
the
countryside
and
be
seen
from
everywhere
as
a
monument
to
his
own
greatness
the
biggest
lordliest
most
expensive
hospice
that
his
architects
could
fashion
with
pictures
in
mosaic
on
the
walls
and
ceilings
of
the
kaiser
and
his
ancestors
in
league
with
the
almighty
but
the
british
had
adopted
it
as
administration
headquarters
occupied
enemy
territory
administration
all
the
way
up
behind
and
in
front
and
on
either
hand
there
were
views
that
would
give
years
of
their
lives
to
see
and
they
would
get
good
value
for
their
bargain
behind
us
the
was
a
panorama
of
the
holy
city
domes
minarets
and
curved
stone
roofs
rising
irregularly
above
gray
battlemented
walls
down
on
the
right
was
the
ghastly
valley
of
jehoshaphat
treeless
dry
and
crowded
with
white
tombs
dry
bones
in
the
valley
of
death
to
the
left
were
everlasting
limestone
hills
one
of
them
topped
by
the
ruined
reputed
tomb
of
samuel
all
trenched
and
but
covered
now
in
a
joseph
coat
of
flowers
blue
yellow
and
white
this
is
no
exaggeration
there
are
actually
millions
and
on
more
than
one
continent
whose
dearest
wish
could
they
have
it
would
be
to
see
jerusalem
before
they
die
there
were
lines
of
camels
sauntering
majestically
along
three
making
time
and
the
speed
of
the
car
we
rode
in
seem
utterly
unreal
and
as
we
topped
the
hill
the
dead
sea
lay
below
us
like
a
polished
turquoise
set
in
the
yellow
gold
of
the
barren
moab
mountains
that
view
made
you
gasp
even
grim
who
was
used
to
it
could
not
turn
his
eyes
away
we
whirled
past
saluting
sikhs
at
the
pompous
kaiserish
entrance
gate
and
got
out
on
to
front
steps
that
brought
to
mind
one
of
those
glittering
hotels
at
german
bad
art
bad
taste
bad
amusements
and
a
big
bill
but
inside
in
the
echoing
stone
corridors
that
opened
through
gothic
windows
on
a
courtyard
in
which
statues
of
german
people
stared
with
blind
eyes
there
was
nothing
now
but
bald
military
neatness
and
economy
hurrying
up
an
uncarpeted
stone
stairway
grim
seemed
to
be
a
once
his
mind
was
set
we
followed
a
corridor
around
two
sides
of
the
square
past
dozens
of
closed
doors
bearing
department
names
to
the
administrator
quarters
at
the
far
end
there
on
a
bare
bench
in
a
barren
grim
left
me
to
cool
my
heels
he
knocked
and
entered
a
door
marked
private
it
was
fully
half
an
hour
before
the
door
opened
again
and
i
was
beckoned
in
grim
was
alone
in
the
room
with
the
administrator
a
rather
small
lean
rigidly
set
up
man
with
merry
fire
in
his
eye
and
an
instantly
obvious
gift
for
being
obeyed
he
sat
at
an
enormous
desk
but
would
have
looked
more
at
ease
in
a
tent
or
on
horseback
the
three
long
rows
of
campaign
ribbons
looked
incongruous
beside
the
bunch
of
flowers
that
somebody
had
crammed
into
a
damascus
vase
on
the
desk
with
the
estimable
military
notion
of
making
the
utmost
use
of
space
sir
louis
was
certainly
in
an
excellent
temper
he
offered
me
a
chair
and
looked
at
me
with
a
sort
of
practical
that
seemed
to
say
well
here
he
is
now
how
shall
we
handle
him
i
was
minded
to
ask
outright
for
what
i
wanted
but
something
in
his
attitude
revealed
that
he
knew
all
that
already
and
would
prefer
to
come
at
the
problem
in
his
own
way
it
was
clear
without
a
word
being
said
that
he
proposed
to
make
some
sort
of
use
of
me
without
being
so
indiscreet
as
to
admit
it
he
reminded
me
rather
of
julius
caesar
who
was
also
a
little
man
considering
the
probable
qualifications
of
some
minor
spoke
in
a
prodigious
wheel
of
plans
i
understand
you
want
to
go
to
he
said
smiling
as
if
all
life
were
an
amusing
game
i
admitted
the
impeachment
grim
was
standing
some
little
way
behind
me
and
to
one
side
i
did
not
turn
my
head
to
look
at
him
for
that
might
have
given
a
false
impression
that
he
and
i
were
in
league
together
but
i
was
somehow
aware
that
with
folded
arms
he
was
studying
me
minutely
well
said
sir
louis
there
no
objection
only
a
stipulation
we
would
let
an
englishman
go
because
of
the
risk
not
to
him
but
to
us
any
fool
has
a
right
to
get
killed
but
not
to
obligate
his
government
all
the
missionaries
were
called
in
from
those
outlying
districts
long
ago
we
do
want
to
be
held
liable
for
damages
for
failure
to
protect
such
things
have
happened
you
see
the
idea
is
we
assume
no
responsibility
for
what
takes
place
beyond
the
jordan
and
the
dead
sea
now
if
you
like
to
sign
a
letter
waiving
any
claim
against
us
for
protection
that
would
remove
any
obstacle
to
your
going
but
if
you
think
that
unreasonable
the
alternative
is
safe
you
can
stay
in
jerusalem
quite
simple
that
had
the
merit
of
frankness
it
sounded
fair
enough
nevertheless
he
was
certainly
not
being
perfectly
frank
the
merriment
in
his
eyes
meant
something
more
than
mere
amusement
it
occurred
to
me
that
his
frankness
took
the
extreme
form
of
not
concealing
that
he
had
something
important
in
reserve
i
rather
liked
him
for
it
his
attitude
seemed
to
be
that
if
i
wanted
to
take
a
chance
i
might
on
my
own
responsibility
but
that
if
my
doing
so
should
happen
to
suit
his
plans
that
was
his
affair
grim
was
still
watching
me
the
way
a
cat
watches
a
mouse
i
sign
such
a
letter
said
i
good
here
are
pen
and
paper
let
have
it
all
in
your
handwriting
i
call
a
clerk
to
witness
the
signature
i
wrote
down
the
simple
statement
that
i
wished
to
go
to
for
personal
reasons
and
that
i
waived
all
claim
against
the
british
administration
for
personal
protection
whether
there
or
en
route
a
clerk
who
looked
as
if
he
could
not
have
been
hired
to
know
or
understand
or
remember
anything
without
permission
came
in
answer
to
the
bell
i
signed
he
witnessed
sir
louis
put
the
letter
in
a
drawer
and
the
clerk
went
out
again
how
soon
will
you
go
i
told
about
the
promised
escort
and
that
a
day
or
two
would
be
needed
to
get
word
to
ben
nasir
i
forgot
that
ben
nasir
would
not
start
before
moonrise
it
appeared
that
sir
louis
knew
more
than
he
cared
to
admit
ca
we
get
word
to
ben
nasir
for
him
grim
grim
nodded
so
did
sir
louis
good
there
be
no
need
then
for
you
to
take
any
one
into
confidence
he
said
turning
to
me
again
as
a
rule
it
well
to
talk
about
these
things
because
people
get
wrong
ideas
there
are
others
in
jerusalem
who
would
like
permission
to
go
to
i
tell
nobody
he
nodded
again
he
was
still
considering
things
in
the
back
of
his
mind
while
those
intelligent
bright
eyes
smiled
so
disarmingly
how
do
you
propose
to
reach
the
dead
sea
he
asked
ben
nasir
escort
will
probably
meet
you
on
the
shore
on
this
side
oh
hire
some
sort
of
conveyance
i
suppose
could
we
lend
him
one
of
our
cars
grim
grim
nodded
again
we
do
that
grim
can
you
get
word
to
ben
nasir
so
that
when
the
escort
is
ready
he
may
send
a
messenger
straight
to
the
hotel
with
the
information
get
my
meaning
sure
said
grim
nobody
else
need
know
then
very
well
said
sir
louis
he
rose
from
his
chair
to
intimate
that
the
precise
moment
had
arrived
when
i
might
leave
without
indiscretion
it
was
not
until
i
was
outside
the
door
that
i
realized
that
my
permission
was
simply
verbal
and
that
the
only
document
that
had
changed
hands
had
been
signed
by
me
grim
followed
me
into
the
after
a
minute
had
i
better
go
back
and
ask
for
something
in
writing
from
him
i
suggested
you
would
get
it
anyhow
you
dealing
with
a
gentleman
you
need
worry
i
was
afraid
once
or
twice
you
might
be
going
to
ask
him
questions
he
have
canned
you
if
you
had
why
did
you
i
was
not
going
to
help
grim
dissect
my
mental
processes
there
a
delightful
air
of
mystery
i
said
i
hate
to
spoil
it
come
up
on
the
tower
he
said
there
just
time
before
sunset
if
you
good
eyes
i
show
you
it
is
an
enormous
tower
the
wireless
apparatus
connected
with
it
can
talk
with
paris
and
calcutta
from
the
top
you
feel
as
if
you
were
seeing
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
world
in
a
moment
of
time
there
are
no
other
buildings
to
cut
off
the
view
or
tamper
with
perspective
the
dead
sea
was
growing
dark
the
moab
hills
beyond
it
looked
lonely
and
savage
in
silhouette
down
there
on
your
left
is
jericho
said
grim
that
winding
creek
beyond
it
is
the
jordan
as
far
eastward
as
that
some
peace
beyond
that
there
is
hardly
a
rock
that
is
used
for
ambush
regularly
let
your
eye
travel
along
the
top
of
the
hills
nearly
as
far
as
the
end
of
the
dead
sea
now
see
where
a
touch
of
sunlight
glints
on
something
that
the
top
of
the
of
judge
what
strategists
those
old
crusaders
were
that
site
commands
the
ancient
high
road
from
egypt
they
could
sit
up
there
and
take
toll
to
their
content
the
turks
quartered
troops
in
the
castle
and
did
the
same
thing
but
the
turks
overdid
it
like
everything
else
they
ruined
the
trade
no
road
there
nowadays
that
amounts
to
anything
it
looks
about
ten
miles
away
more
than
eighty
the
sun
went
down
behind
us
while
we
watched
and
here
and
there
the
little
scattered
lights
came
out
among
the
silent
hills
in
proof
that
there
were
humans
who
thought
of
them
in
terms
of
home
venus
and
mars
shone
forth
yellow
and
red
jewels
then
the
moon
rising
like
a
stage
effect
too
big
too
strongly
lighted
to
seem
real
peering
inch
by
inch
above
the
hills
and
ushering
in
silence
we
could
hear
one
muezzin
in
jerusalem
wailing
that
god
is
god
that
over
yonder
is
savage
country
grim
remarked
i
think
maybe
you
like
it
time
to
go
now
he
said
nothing
more
until
we
were
scooting
downhill
in
the
car
in
the
midst
of
a
cloud
of
dust
you
wo
see
me
again
he
said
then
until
you
get
to
kerak
there
are
just
one
or
two
points
to
bear
in
mind
care
if
i
lecture
i
wish
you
would
when
the
messenger
comes
from
ben
nasir
go
to
the
governorate
just
outside
the
damascus
gate
phone
oeta
say
who
you
are
and
ask
for
the
car
travel
light
the
less
you
take
with
you
the
less
temptation
there
be
to
steal
and
that
much
less
danger
for
your
escort
i
always
take
nothing
and
get
shaved
by
a
murderer
at
the
nearest
village
if
you
wash
too
much
or
change
your
shirt
too
often
they
suspect
you
of
putting
on
airs
travel
too
light
use
the
car
as
far
as
jericho
or
thereabouts
and
send
it
back
when
the
messenger
says
he
through
with
it
after
that
do
whatever
the
leader
of
the
escort
tells
you
and
you
be
all
right
how
do
i
cross
the
dead
sea
that
ben
nasir
business
there
another
point
i
ask
you
to
bear
in
mind
when
you
see
me
at
be
sure
not
to
make
the
slightest
sign
of
recognition
unless
and
until
you
get
word
from
me
act
as
if
you
never
seen
me
in
your
life
before
i
felt
like
an
and
there
is
no
other
sensation
half
so
thrilling
the
flattery
of
being
let
in
as
it
were
through
a
secret
door
was
like
strong
wine
is
your
memory
good
grim
asked
me
if
you
make
notes
be
sure
you
let
everybody
see
them
you
find
more
than
one
of
them
can
read
english
if
you
should
see
or
overhear
anything
that
you
particularly
like
to
remember
because
it
might
prove
useful
to
me
note
it
down
by
making
faint
dots
under
the
letters
of
words
you
already
written
or
better
yet
take
along
a
pocket
bible
they
all
religious
and
respect
the
bible
make
faint
pencil
lines
underneath
words
or
letters
and
they
think
you
more
than
extra
devout
there
nothing
special
to
watch
out
for
just
keep
your
ears
and
eyes
open
well
here
your
hotel
see
you
again
soon
so
long
i
got
out
of
the
car
and
went
to
get
ready
for
a
christian
dinner
served
by
moslems
feeling
like
a
person
out
of
the
arabian
nights
who
had
just
met
the
owner
of
a
magic
carpet
on
which
one
only
had
to
sit
in
order
to
be
wafted
by
invisible
forces
into
unimaginable
realms
of
mystery
chapter
three
do
whatever
the
leader
of
the
escort
tells
you
i
never
learned
exactly
how
jim
grim
got
word
to
ben
nasir
my
suspicion
is
that
he
took
the
simple
course
of
getting
the
american
colony
to
send
one
of
their
men
but
as
they
never
referred
to
it
afterwards
and
might
have
their
own
reasons
for
keeping
silence
i
took
care
not
to
ask
them
we
have
most
of
us
seen
harm
done
by
noisy
gratitude
for
kindness
better
covered
up
i
kept
close
to
the
hotel
for
three
days
studying
arabic
by
the
fourth
afternoon
discouragement
set
in
i
began
to
believe
that
the
whole
affair
had
petered
out
perhaps
on
reflection
the
administrator
had
decided
i
was
not
a
proper
person
to
be
turned
loose
out
of
bounds
and
nobody
could
have
blamed
him
for
that
for
he
knew
next
to
nothing
about
me
or
grim
might
have
been
called
off
for
some
other
important
business
the
chances
seemed
all
against
my
going
after
all
but
on
the
fourth
evening
just
at
sunset
when
the
sandwiches
i
had
ordered
in
advance
were
all
thoroughly
stale
and
i
had
almost
decided
to
unpack
the
small
and
try
to
forget
the
whole
affair
i
noticed
an
arab
standing
in
the
door
of
the
hotel
scrutinizing
every
one
who
passed
him
i
watched
him
for
five
minutes
he
paid
no
attention
to
officers
in
uniform
i
left
my
chair
in
the
lobby
and
walked
past
him
twice
he
had
one
eye
like
a
gimlet
on
a
universal
joint
he
turned
it
this
and
that
way
without
any
corresponding
movement
of
his
head
it
penetrated
you
felt
he
could
have
seen
you
with
it
in
the
dark
i
started
to
pass
him
a
third
time
he
held
his
hand
out
and
thrust
a
small
soiled
piece
of
paper
into
mine
the
writing
on
it
was
in
arabic
so
i
went
back
to
the
seat
in
the
far
corner
to
puzzle
it
out
he
standing
meanwhile
in
the
doorway
and
continuing
to
quiz
people
as
if
i
had
meant
nothing
in
his
life
the
message
was
short
enough
bearer
will
accompany
you
to
a
place
where
the
escort
will
be
in
readiness
god
give
your
honour
a
good
journey
mustapha
ben
nasir
i
went
to
the
governorate
and
phoned
for
the
car
to
come
and
pick
me
up
outside
the
jaffa
gate
the
arab
followed
me
and
he
and
i
were
both
searched
at
the
gate
for
weapons
by
a
sikh
who
knew
nothing
and
cared
less
about
near
east
politics
his
orders
were
to
search
thoroughly
he
did
it
the
man
whose
turn
was
next
ahead
of
mine
was
a
russian
priest
whose
long
black
cloak
did
not
save
him
from
painstaking
suspicion
he
was
still
indignantly
refusing
to
take
down
his
pants
and
prove
that
the
hard
lump
on
his
thigh
was
really
an
amulet
against
sciatica
when
the
car
came
for
me
it
was
an
ordinary
ford
car
and
the
driver
was
not
in
uniform
he
too
had
only
one
eye
in
full
commission
for
the
other
was
bruised
and
father
swollen
i
got
in
beside
him
and
let
the
arab
have
the
rear
seat
to
himself
reflecting
that
i
would
be
able
to
smell
all
the
arab
sweat
i
cared
to
in
the
days
to
come
we
are
governed
much
more
by
our
noses
than
we
are
often
aware
of
and
i
believe
that
many
people
in
the
east
especially
use
scent
because
intuition
warns
them
that
their
true
smell
would
arouse
unconscious
antagonism
dogs
as
well
as
most
wild
animals
fight
at
the
suggestion
of
a
smell
humans
only
differ
from
the
animals
much
when
they
are
being
human
then
they
forget
what
they
really
know
and
tumble
headlong
into
trouble
the
driver
seemed
to
know
which
road
to
take
and
to
be
in
no
particular
hurry
perhaps
on
account
of
his
injured
eye
he
was
an
of
course
one
of
those
cockneys
with
the
whitechapel
pallor
overlying
a
pugnacious
instinct
who
make
such
astonishing
in
the
intervals
between
sulking
and
a
sort
of
abuse
of
everything
in
sight
being
impatient
to
begin
the
adventure
i
suggested
more
speed
oh
he
answered
so
you
another
o
these
people
in
an
to
get
to
jericho
it
strynge
the
last
one
was
a
harab
tyke
it
from
me
i
driven
the
very
last
harab
as
gets
more
than
miles
an
hour
out
o
me
so
me
he
tooled
the
car
out
on
to
the
road
toward
bethany
and
down
the
steep
hill
that
passes
under
the
garden
of
gethsemane
before
vouchsafing
another
word
then
as
we
started
to
climb
the
hill
ahead
he
jerked
his
chin
in
the
direction
of
the
sharp
turn
we
had
just
passed
in
the
bottom
of
the
valley
took
that
corner
las
time
on
one
wheel
for
the
arab
aye
taught
me
a
lesson
never
agayn
i
ai
no
arabian
night
nor
yet
no
invitin
no
juggernauts
to
make
no
pancykes
out
o
me
i
drives
reasonable
all
harabs
may
go
to
for
all
o
me
he
was
itching
to
tell
his
story
he
was
likely
to
tell
it
quicker
for
not
being
questioned
your
cockney
dislikes
anything
he
can
construe
into
inquisition
i
remarked
that
the
road
did
seem
made
for
speed
too
narrow
and
too
rough
and
let
it
go
at
that
he
said
no
more
until
we
reached
the
village
of
bethany
and
drew
abreast
of
lazarus
reputed
tomb
where
a
pack
of
awoke
and
yelped
around
the
wheels
he
did
his
best
to
run
over
one
of
them
but
missed
then
he
could
not
hold
his
story
any
longer
two
nights
ago
he
said
they
gives
me
orders
to
take
a
harab
to
a
point
near
jericho
after
dark
i
starts
off
on
the
back
seat
engine
ai
warm
yet
so
we
goes
slow
he
leans
forward
after
a
couple
o
minutes
an
says
kawam
so
i
thinks
to
myself
i
show
the
blighter
a
thing
or
two
me
not
bein
used
to
takin
orders
from
no
harabs

as

i
lets
rip
an
you

when
we
gets
to
the
top
o
that

gethsemane
i
lets
extry
special
rip

i
if

i

son

well
we
all

places
and
lands
on
a
bit
o
level
road
just
often

to
pick
up
more
speed

round
that
sharp
bend
on
a
wheel
syme
as
i
told
you
kills
three
dogs
for
sure
an
maybe
others
but
i
do

the
dark
that
close
that
the

my
arms

up
an
down
me
a
lump
o
rock
that
comes
near
tippin
us
into
the
ditch
an
carries
on
faster
ever
by
the
time
we
gets

bethany
thinks
i
it

a
look

ai
such
easy

dozen
curs
makes
a
rush
for
me
when
what
suppose
that
bloomin
harab
passenger
o
mine
vaults
over
into
my
seat
an
afore
i
could

by
the
luck

strike
me
blind
i
did
dare
look
where
we
are
now
can
you
see
the
turn
at
the
bottom
of
this
with
a
ditch
beyond
it
well
we
takes
that
turn
in
shadow
with
all
four
wheels
in
the
air
an
you
thought
we
was
a
blinkin
airplane
a
doin
stunts
but
a
hexpert
is
an
we
the
road
from
there
on
we
goes
in
one
murderin
streak
to
a
point
about
up

where
the
inn
of
the
good
samaritan

on
top
there
we

no
tools

seat
there
never

in
this
country
if
you
left
your
car
out
your
sight
for
five
minutes
take
off
them
two
back
tires
i
says
i
sit
an
meditate
on
the
ways
of
harabs
maybe
you
moses
i
says
know
to
work
a
miracle
but
the
only
miracle
about
that
bloke
nerve
gets
out
begins
to
walk
straight
on
without
as
much
as
a
i
shouts
to
to
come
back
but
walks
on
so
i
picks
up
a
stone
off
the
pile
i
was
sittin
on
an
i
plugs
good
fair
between
the
you
think
if
was
a
harab
bring
to
senses
would
you
but
what
suppose
the
blighter
did
did
you
notice
my
left
eye
when
you
got
in
the
car
turns
back
an
thinks
i
goin
to
knife
me
but
that
sport
could
use
fists
an
believe
me
done
it
i
can
use
a
bit
myself
an
i
starts
in
to
knock
block
off
but
puts
it
all
over
me
weight
reach
an
science
mind
you
science
first
arab
ever
i
see
what
science
an
i
do
more
than
believe
it
now
got
to
it
to
was
merciful
let
up
on
me
the
minute
see
i
enough
starts
off
again
i
sits
where
knocked
me
on
to
a
stone
pile
wishin
like
for
a
drink
it
was
full
moonlight
an
you
could
see
for
miles
after
about
fifteen
minutes
me
still
meditatin
murder
considerin
my
thirst
i
seen
fetch
a
camel
out
o
the
khan
at
the
inn
o
the
good
samaritan
an
next
thing
you
know
out
o
sight
thinks
i
that
the
last
of
an
good
riddance
but
not
a
bit
of
it
the
men
what
fetched
the
camel
for
comes
down
to
me
an
says
the
sheikh
left
word
i
to
be
fed
an
looked
after
they
fixes
me
up
at
the
inn
with
a
cot
an
blankets
an
a
supper
sorts
an
i
lies
awake
listenin
to
talkin
arabic
understandin
maybe
one
word
out
of
six
or
seven
from
what
i
can
make
o
their
conjecturin
they
think
ai
no
sheikh
at
all
but
a
bloomin
british
officer
in
disguise
soon
as
morning
comes
i
jump
a
passing
commissariat
lorry
as
soon
as
i
gets
to
jerusalem
i
reports
that
sheikh
for
arson
theft
felo
de
se
busting
a
car
usin
fists
when
by
right
should
ha
knifed
me
an
every
other
crime
i
could
think
of
an
all
i
gets
is
laughed
at
what
make
of
it
think
was
a
harab
i
wondered
whether
he
was
jimgrim
but
did
not
say
so
grim
had
not
appeared
to
me
like
a
man
who
would
use
his
fists
at
all
readily
but
he
was
such
an
unusual
individual
that
it
was
useless
trying
to
outline
what
he
might
or
might
not
do
it
was
also
quite
likely
that
the
chauffeur
had
omitted
mention
of
say
of
the
provocation
he
gave
his
passenger
what
interested
me
most
was
the
thought
that
if
that
really
was
jimgrim
he
must
have
been
in
a
prodigious
hurry
about
something
and
that
most
likely
meant
excitement
if
not
danger
across
the
dead
sea
we
caught
sight
of
the
dead
sea
presently
bowling
past
the
inn
of
the
good
samaritan
and
beginning
to
descend
into
the
valley
twelve
hundred
feet
below
sea
level
that
separates
palestine
from
moab
the
moon
shone
full
on
the
water
and
it
looked
more
wan
and
wild
than
an
illustration
out
of
dante
inferno
there
was
no
doubt
how
the
legends
sprang
up
about
birds
falling
dead
as
they
flew
across
it
it
was
difficult
to
believe
that
anything
could
be
there
and
not
die
it
was
a
vision
of
the
land
of
death
made
beautiful
but
the
arab
on
the
rear
seat
began
to
sing
to
him
that
view
meant
home
sweet
home
his
song
was
all
about
his
village
and
how
he
loved
it
what
a
pearl
it
was
how
sweeter
than
all
cities
at
the
driver
stopped
the
car
to
fill
his
pipe
you
think
lived
in
i
fought
over
every
hinch
this
perishin
country
an
tyke
it
from
me
there
a
village
in
it
but
what
composed
of
wi
thatched
roofs
an
o
dung
so
you
ca
walk
between
any
one
as
wants
my
share
o
palestine
can
it
we
bumped
on
again
down
a
road
so
lonely
that
it
would
have
felt
good
to
see
a
wild
beast
or
an
armed
man
lurking
in
wait
for
us
but
the
british
had
accomplished
the
impossible
they
had
so
laid
the
fear
of
law
along
those
roads
that
though
there
might
be
murders
to
the
right
and
left
of
them
the
who
kept
to
the
road
was
safe
for
the
first
time
since
the
romans
now
and
then
imposed
a
temporary
peace
at
last
like
two
yellow
streams
glistening
in
moonlight
the
road
forked
one
way
toward
jericho
the
other
way
appeared
to
run
more
or
less
parallel
with
the
dead
sea
at
that
point
the
arab
left
off
singing
at
last
and
clutched
the
driver
shoulder
all
right
all
right
he
answered
impatiently
and
stopped
out
you
get
then
he
did
not
expect
the
tip
i
gave
him
he
seemed
to
think
it
placed
him
under
obligation
to
wait
there
and
talk
for
a
few
minutes
but
my
guide
waved
him
away
disgustedly
with
the
hand
that
did
not
hold
my
bag
and
we
stood
in
the
road
watching
until
he
vanished
out
of
sight
then
the
guide
plucked
my
sleeve
and
i
followed
him
along
the
righthand
road
we
walked
half
a
mile
as
fast
as
he
could
set
foot
to
the
ground
at
last
we
reached
a
pretense
of
a
village
a
little
cluster
of
thatched
stone
huts
enclosed
within
one
fence
of
thorn
and
cactus
everything
showed
up
as
clearly
in
the
moonlight
as
if
painted
with
phosphorus
the
heavy
shadows
only
made
the
high
lights
seem
more
luminous
a
man
and
two
donkeys
were
waiting
for
us
outside
the
thorn
hedge
the
man
made
no
remark
my
guide
and
i
mounted
and
rode
on
presently
we
turned
down
a
track
toward
the
dead
sea
riding
among
huge
shadows
cast
by
the
hills
on
our
right
hand
the
little
jackals
they
call
foxes
crossed
our
path
at
intervals
owls
the
size
of
a
robin
only
vastly
fluffier
screamed
from
the
rocks
as
we
passed
them
otherwise
it
was
like
a
soul
last
journey
eerie
lonely
and
awful
down
toward
river
styx
long
before
we
caught
sight
of
the
water
again
through
a
ragged
gap
between
high
limestone
rocks
i
could
smell
a
village
the
guide
approached
it
cautiously
stopping
every
minute
or
so
to
listen
when
we
came
on
it
at
last
it
was
down
below
us
in
abysmal
darkness
one
light
shining
through
a
window
two
feet
square
in
proof
we
were
not
hesitating
on
the
verge
of
the
infinite
pit
the
donkeys
knew
the
way
they
trod
daintily
like
little
ladies
along
a
circling
track
that
goats
made
and
men
had
certainly
done
nothing
to
improve
we
made
an
almost
complete
ellipse
around
and
down
and
rode
at
last
over
dry
dung
at
the
bottom
into
which
the
donkeys
feet
sank
as
into
a
carpet
you
could
see
the
stars
overhead
but
nothing
where
we
were
except
that
window
and
a
shaft
of
yellow
light
with
hundreds
of
moths
dazzled
in
it
we
must
have
made
some
noise
in
spite
of
the
donkeys
vetvet
as
we
crossed
the
shaft
of
light
a
door
opened
within
six
feet
of
the
window
a
man
in
arab
deshabille
with
a
red
tarboosh
awry
thrust
out
his
head
and
drew
it
in
again
quickly
is
that
the
american
he
asked
he
held
the
door
so
that
he
could
slam
it
in
our
faces
if
required
the
guide
made
no
answer
i
gave
my
name
the
man
opened
the
door
wider
lailtak
effendi
hishkur
allah
come
in
mister
the
guide
led
the
donkeys
away
to
some
invisible
place
i
crossed
the
threshold
my
host
holding
his
tin
lantern
carefully
to
show
the
two
steps
leading
down
to
a
floor
he
bolted
the
door
the
moment
i
was
inside
he
seemed
in
a
great
state
of
excitement
and
afraid
to
make
any
noise
even
when
he
shot
the
bolt
he
did
it
silently
it
was
a
square
room
moderately
clean
furnished
only
with
a
table
and
two
chairs
there
were
other
rooms
leading
off
it
but
the
stone
partitions
did
not
reach
as
high
as
the
thatch
and
i
could
hear
rustling
and
some
one
snoring
i
sat
on
one
of
the
chairs
at
his
invitation
and
rather
hoped
for
supper
having
had
none
but
supper
was
not
in
his
mind
it
seemed
he
had
too
much
else
to
worry
him
he
looked
like
a
man
who
worried
easily
and
likely
enough
with
good
reason
for
his
long
nose
and
narrow
eyes
did
not
suggest
honesty
there
was
to
be
an
escort
to
meet
me
here
i
said
yes
yes
thank
god
mister
you
have
come
at
last
if
you
had
only
come
at
sunset
ali
has
gone
to
bring
them
now
who
is
ali
he
with
one
eye
he
who
brought
you
your
escort
came
at
sunset
because
i
am
christian
they
would
not
listen
to
me
or
wait
for
you
in
my
house
there
are
twenty
of
them
led
by
anazeh
who
is
a
bad
rascal
they
have
gone
to
raid
the
villages
there
has
been
trouble
i
have
heard
two
shots
fired
now
they
will
come
back
to
my
house
and
if
the
sikh
patrol
is
after
them
they
will
be
caught
here
and
i
shall
be
accused
of
helping
them
may
the
fires
of
their
lying
prophet
eblis
burn
anazeh
and
his
men
forever
and
ever
amen
may
god
curse
their
religion
that
was
a
nice
state
of
affairs
i
did
not
want
to
be
caught
there
by
a
lot
of
truculent
sikhs
under
one
of
those
jocularly
incredulous
young
british
subalterns
that
sikhs
adore
in
the
first
place
i
had
nothing
whatever
in
writing
to
prove
my
innocence
the
least
that
was
likely
to
happen
would
be
an
ignominious
return
to
jerusalem
after
a
night
in
a
should
there
be
a
failing
that
a
night
in
the
open
within
easy
reach
of
sikh
bayonets
in
jerusalem
no
doubt
sir
louis
would
order
me
released
immediately
but
it
began
to
look
as
if
the
whole
mystery
after
all
was
nothing
but
a
staged
decoy
using
me
for
bait
not
even
tadpoles
enjoy
being
used
for
without
being
consulted
first
i
began
to
spear
about
for
remedies
if
you
an
honest
man
i
said
you
better
simply
deny
all
connection
with
the
raid
hah
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
did
not
look
like
an
honest
man
he
was
one
he
knew
it
he
retorted
gloomily
anazeh
scoundrels
will
have
raided
sheep
and
perhaps
cattle
if
any
one
has
resisted
them
there
will
be
wailing
widows
crying
out
for
vengeance
they
will
put
the
sheep
and
cattle
in
their
boats
in
which
they
came
over
the
sea
this
afternoon
the
boats
will
be
found
by
the
sikhs
hauled
up
on
the
just
below
my
house
with
my
beside
them
i
am
ruined
well
my
own
predicament
was
better
than
that
nobody
was
likely
to
accuse
me
of
having
stolen
sheep
but
i
could
not
feel
sorry
for
my
host
because
he
was
so
sorry
for
himself
he
was
one
of
those
unfortunates
who
carry
the
conviction
of
their
own
guilt
in
their
faces
i
gave
up
all
idea
of
relying
on
him
in
case
the
sikhs
should
come
my
next
idea
was
to
ask
for
the
loan
of
one
of
the
donkeys
and
to
start
back
toward
jerusalem
but
i
had
not
more
than
thought
of
it
when
men
footsteps
pattered
on
the
yard
dung
and
an
indubitable
beat
on
the
wooden
door
for
god
sake
hissed
the
owner
of
the
place
he
ran
to
the
door
to
open
it
as
the
thumping
grew
louder
as
he
drew
the
bolt
somebody
kicked
the
door
open
sending
him
reeling
backwards
for
a
second
i
thought
the
sikhs
had
come
but
he
was
nothing
like
a
sikh
who
strode
in
with
a
dozen
ruffians
at
his
tail
and
ali
bringing
up
the
rear
he
was
one
of
the
arabs
i
had
ever
seen
although
considerably
past
fifty
and
wrinkled
so
that
his
face
was
a
work
of
fine
lines
out
of
which
his
big
dark
eyes
shone
with
unaged
intelligence
he
was
magnificently
dressed
perhaps
in
order
to
do
me
honour
except
for
the
fact
that
he
carried
a
modern
military
rifle
on
his
elbow
in
place
of
a
crook
or
a
spear
he
looked
like
one
of
those
historic
worthies
who
stalk
through
the
pages
of
the
pentateuch
the
dignity
and
charm
with
which
he
bowed
to
me
were
inimitable
unconveyable
but
he
turned
on
my
christian
host
like
a
prophet
of
old
rebuking
blasphemy
arabic
when
the
right
man
uses
it
sounds
like
law
being
laid
down
hebrew
is
all
music
and
soft
vowels
arabic
all
guttural
consonants
the
sheikh
anazeh
there
was
no
doubt
of
his
identity
they
all
kept
calling
him
by
name
fulminated
the
other
bleated
at
him
i
learned
his
name
at
last
ali
of
the
one
eye
pressed
forward
took
him
by
the
sleeve
and
called
him
ahmed
ali
seemed
to
be
adding
persuasion
to
anazeh
threats
whatever
it
was
they
were
driving
at
ahmed
began
to
look
like
yielding
so
as
i
could
not
untangle
more
than
one
brief
sentence
at
a
time
from
all
those
galloping
arguments
i
pulled
ahmed
away
into
a
corner
what
do
they
all
want
i
asked
him
tell
me
in
ten
words
but
he
was
not
a
brief
man
they
say
the
sikhs
are
after
them
they
have
put
the
stolen
sheep
into
their
boats
as
i
told
you
they
would
mister
now
they
order
me
to
tow
them
with
my
but
it
can
not
be
done
mister
it
can
not
be
done
i
tell
them
there
is
government
launch
near
jericho
that
the
sikh
patrol
can
use
to
overtake
us
i
have
a
swift
boat
but
if
i
take
in
tow
two
other
loaded
boats
we
shall
be
caught
and
then
who
will
save
everything
i
have
from
confiscation
how
close
are
the
sikhs
i
asked
god
knows
mister
they
can
come
fast
unless
i
consent
to
let
them
use
my
boat
anazeh
will
order
his
men
to
kill
me
and
then
they
will
take
the
boat
in
any
case
there
is
only
one
thing
they
must
leave
the
sheep
behind
and
all
crowd
into
my
boat
but
i
can
not
persuade
them
at
that
moment
another
of
anazeh
party
burst
in
through
the
door
he
evidently
bore
bad
news
catching
sight
of
me
he
lowered
his
voice
to
a
whisper
and
whatever
he
said
anazeh
nodded
gravely
then
the
old
sheikh
gave
an
order
and
four
of
his
men
came
without
further
ado
to
seize
ahmed
bear
me
witness
the
wretched
man
called
back
to
me
as
they
dragged
him
off
i
go
under
protest
most
unwillingly
somebody
struck
him
with
a
a
woman
head
appeared
over
the
top
of
the
partition
and
began
to
jabber
noisily
several
of
anazeh
men
hurled
jests
the
highest
compliment
they
paid
her
was
to
call
her
the
mother
of
sin
anazeh
beckoned
to
me
he
did
not
seem
to
doubt
for
an
instant
that
i
would
follow
him
i
was
in
no
mind
to
wait
there
and
be
arrested
by
the
sikh
patrol
i
wondered
whether
they
were
coming
in
open
order
combing
the
countryside
or
heading
all
together
straight
for
a
known
objective
and
whether
in
either
case
i
could
give
them
the
slip
and
head
back
toward
jerusalem
in
that
minute
i
recalled
grim
advice
do
whatever
the
leader
of
the
escort
tells
you
and
you
be
all
right
you
need
be
afraid
to
trust
him
that
settled
it
i
did
not
suppose
for
a
minute
that
grim
had
contemplated
any
such
contingency
as
this
but
he
had
volunteered
the
advice
so
the
consequences
would
be
his
affair
i
followed
anazeh
into
outer
darkness
and
one
of
his
men
pulled
the
door
to
after
me
there
was
something
very
like
a
panic
down
by
the
waterside
three
hundred
yards
away
from
the
house
it
needed
all
authority
to
straighten
matters
out
there
were
divided
counsels
and
the
raiders
were
working
at
a
disadvantage
in
total
darkness
the
shadow
of
the
hills
fell
just
beyond
the
stern
of
the
boats
as
they
lay
with
their
bows
ashore
they
had
already
forced
ahmed
into
his
own
where
he
was
struggling
vainly
to
crank
a
cold
engine
some
of
the
others
were
trying
to
push
off
a
boat
full
of
bleating
sheep
one
man
was
carrying
a
fat
sheep
in
his
arms
toward
the
splashing
in
the
water
and
shouting
advice
to
everybody
else
and
in
the
end
that
was
the
only
piece
of
plunder
they
got
away
with
suddenly
one
man
who
had
been
left
behind
to
keep
a
came
leaping
like
a
ghost
among
the
shadows
shouting
the
one
word
askeri
soldiers
he
jumped
straight
into
the
anazeh
bullied
all
the
rest
in
after
him
i
climbed
in
over
the
bow
by
that
time
you
could
not
have
crowded
in
one
more
passenger
with
the
aid
of
a
battering
ram
yalla
barked
anazeh
but
the
engine
would
not
start
curdling
threats
were
hurled
at
the
unhappy
ahmed
some
e
of
the
men
got
into
the
water
and
began
to
shove
off
as
if
the
engine
could
be
encouraged
by
collaboration
i
was
just
as
keen
to
escape
as
any
one
i
could
not
imagine
a
sikh
or
subaltern
stupid
enough
to
believe
me
innocent
it
was
a
military
government
soldiers
have
a
method
of
leaving
nothing
to
discuss
except
where
the
corpse
is
to
be
buried
i
forced
my
way
aft
got
some
gasoline
out
of
the
tank
into
a
tin
cup
thrust
aside
ahmed
and
two
other
men
and
primed
the
engine
liberally
the
engine
coughed
next
time
they
moved
the
wheel
and
in
thirty
seconds
more
we
had
it
going
ahmed
came
in
for
a
volley
of
mockery
for
having
to
be
shown
the
way
to
start
his
engine
but
from
the
sour
way
he
looked
at
me
i
was
nearly
sure
he
had
stalled
deliberately
we
backed
away
from
shore
and
anazeh
steered
the
boat
nose
eastward
then
somebody
at
the
reversing
lever
threw
it
forward
too
suddenly
and
the
still
chilled
engine
stopped
it
took
about
another
minute
to
restart
it
we
were
just
beginning
to
gain
speed
when
some
one
shouted
all
eyes
turned
toward
the
shore
the
overloaded
boat
rocking
dangerously
as
the
crowd
bent
their
bodies
all
in
one
direction
together
down
near
the
an
electric
torch
flashed
on
the
uniforms
of
sikhs
and
we
could
hear
an
unmistakably
british
voice
shouting
an
order
we
were
out
in
the
moonlight
now
a
perfect
target
bullets
chanced
at
us
could
hardly
fail
to
hit
somebody
two
or
three
shots
might
sink
us
but
anazeh
had
presence
of
mind
he
changed
helm
so
as
to
present
us
to
the
shore
low
in
the
water
though
the
boat
was
we
were
beginning
to
make
good
headway
the
sikhs
lost
no
time
shots
began
to
whizz
overhead
and
to
splash
the
water
around
us
but
the
boat
was
painted
gray
as
we
increased
the
distance
we
must
have
looked
like
a
moving
patch
of
darker
water
with
a
puzzling
wake
behind
us
the
sea
was
still
the
stars
were
reflected
in
it
in
unsteady
dots
and
streaks
the
moon
cast
a
silver
patch
of
light
that
shimmered
and
confused
the
eye
sikhs
are
not
by
any
means
all
marksmen
at
any
rate
the
shots
all
missed
though
some
of
our
party
anazeh
included
returned
the
fire
none
boasted
of
having
hit
any
one
and
an
arab
boasts
at
the
least
excuse
in
a
few
minutes
we
were
out
of
range
and
since
there
was
no
pursuing
launch
in
sight
could
afford
to
jeer
at
the
sikhs
in
chorus
there
were
things
said
about
their
habits
and
their
ancestry
that
it
is
to
be
hoped
they
did
not
hear
or
at
any
rate
understand
for
the
sake
of
any
arab
prisoners
they
might
take
in
future
it
always
struck
me
as
a
fool
game
to
mock
your
enemy
if
you
fall
in
his
power
at
any
time
he
would
be
almost
more
than
human
if
he
did
not
remember
it
it
seemed
to
me
unlikely
that
those
sikhs
would
forget
to
avenge
the
arab
compliments
that
must
have
sizzled
in
ears
across
that
sea
after
that
the
only
immediate
danger
was
from
the
wind
that
sometimes
blows
down
in
sudden
gusts
from
between
the
it
would
have
needed
only
half
a
sea
to
swamp
us
but
the
dead
sea
was
living
up
to
its
reputation
quiet
inert
like
a
mercury
mirror
for
the
stars
a
brooding
place
of
silence
the
arabs
spirits
rose
as
we
chugged
toward
their
savage
hills
they
began
to
sing
glorious
songs
about
women
and
mares
and
camels
presently
anazeh
improvised
an
epic
about
the
raid
abortive
though
it
had
been
he
left
out
all
the
disappointing
part
he
sang
first
of
the
three
fools
whose
boats
they
had
stolen
then
of
the
baffled
rage
of
those
same
fools
when
they
should
learn
their
property
was
lost
forever
presently
as
he
warmed
to
the
spirit
of
the
thing
he
sang
about
the
wails
of
the
frightened
villagers
from
whom
they
had
plundered
sheep
and
goats
and
of
the
skill
and
resourcefulness
with
which
the
party
had
escaped
pursuit
under
his
leadership
allah
favoring
and
blessed
be
his
prophet
last
he
sang
about
me
the
honoured
stranger
for
whom
they
had
dared
everything
and
conquered
and
whom
they
were
taking
to
kerak
he
described
me
as
a
prince
from
a
far
country
the
son
of
a
hundred
kings
it
was
a
good
song
i
got
ahmed
to
translate
it
to
me
afterwards
but
i
suspect
that
ahmed
toned
it
down
in
deference
to
what
he
may
have
thought
might
be
my
modesty
and
moralistic
scruples
chapter
four
i
am
willing
to
use
all
means
all
methods
ahmed
knew
the
dead
sea
he
knew
its
moods
and
a
few
of
its
tricks
so
he
was
suitably
scared
he
was
more
of
raid
of
the
treacherous
sea
than
of
his
captors
they
were
treacherous
in
the
least
they
were
frankly
disobedient
of
any
law
except
their
own
respectful
of
nothing
but
bullets
brains
and
their
own
interpretation
of
the
will
of
allah
they
showed
sublime
indifference
to
danger
that
always
comes
of
ignorance
ahmed
was
for
running
straight
across
to
cut
the
voyage
short
because
of
the
wind
that
sometimes
blows
from
the
south
at
dawn
he
said
it
might
kick
up
a
sea
that
would
roll
us
over
for
the
weight
of
the
dead
sea
waves
in
a
blow
is
prodigious
they
overruled
his
protest
with
unanimity
and
lots
of
abuse
anazeh
continued
to
steer
a
diagonal
course
for
a
notch
in
the
moab
hills
that
look
until
you
get
quite
close
to
them
as
if
they
rose
sheer
out
of
the
sea
the
old
chief
was
pretty
amateurish
at
the
helm
whatever
his
other
attainments
our
wake
was
like
a
drunkard
what
with
the
danger
in
that
overcrowded
boat
and
the
manifestly
compromising
fact
that
i
had
now
become
one
of
a
gang
who
boasted
of
the
murder
they
had
done
that
night
i
did
some
speculation
that
seems
ridiculous
now
at
this
distance
after
a
lapse
of
time
it
occurred
to
me
that
grim
might
be
disguised
as
a
member
of
anazeh
party
as
far
as
possible
in
the
dark
i
thoroughly
scrutinized
each
individual
it
is
easy
to
laugh
about
it
now
but
i
actually
made
my
way
to
anazeh
side
and
tried
to
discover
whether
the
old
sheikh
wrinkles
and
beard
were
not
a
very
skillfully
done
at
any
rate
i
got
from
that
absurd
investigation
the
sure
knowledge
that
grim
was
not
in
the
boat
with
us
i
could
not
talk
with
anazeh
very
well
because
when
he
tried
to
understand
my
amateurish
arabic
and
to
modify
his
flow
of
stately
speech
to
meet
my
needs
he
always
put
his
head
down
and
the
helm
with
it
it
seemed
wisest
to
let
him
do
one
unaccustomed
thing
at
a
time
i
did
not
care
to
try
to
talk
with
any
of
his
men
because
that
might
possibly
have
been
a
breach
of
etiquette
arab
jealousy
is
about
as
quick
as
fulminate
of
mercury
as
unreasonable
from
a
western
viewpoint
as
a
woman
but
there
did
not
seem
any
objection
to
talking
with
ahmed
he
was
at
least
in
theory
my
and
not
a
person
any
moslem
in
that
boat
was
likely
to
be
jealous
of
he
jumped
at
the
notion
of
making
friends
with
me
he
made
no
secret
of
the
reason
you
are
safe
effendi
they
will
neither
rob
you
nor
kill
you
nor
let
you
get
killed
you
are
their
guest
but
as
for
me
they
would
cut
my
throat
as
readily
as
that
sheep
more
especially
since
they
have
discovered
that
you
know
how
to
start
the
engine
my
best
chance
was
to
make
them
believe
that
the
engine
is
difficult
to
understand
because
of
your
knowledge
they
now
feel
independent
of
me
so
i
must
yield
to
them
in
everything
and
if
they
force
me
to
swear
on
a
bible
and
on
my
father
honour
and
in
the
name
of
god
that
i
will
not
give
evidence
against
them
i
shall
have
to
swear
an
oath
given
under
compulsion
i
began
but
he
laughed
cynically
ah
you
do
not
know
this
land
these
folk
effendi
if
i
were
to
break
such
an
oath
as
that
they
would
burn
my
house
steal
my
cattle
ravish
my
wife
and
hunt
me
to
the
death
if
i
ran
away
to
america
arabs
in
chicago
and
new
york
would
continue
the
hunt
this
is
a
land
where
an
oath
is
binding
unless
you
are
the
stronger
i
am
weak
an
unimportant
person
what
is
your
business
i
asked
there
is
no
business
for
a
man
like
me
the
regulations
forbid
commerce
in
the
only
goods
for
which
there
is
a
real
demand
among
bedouins
so
you
a
smuggler
eh
he
laughed
between
pride
and
caution
and
changed
the
subject
i
shall
do
what
they
order
me
effendi
i
think
they
will
keep
my
boat
over
there
to
bring
you
back
again
but
when
i
get
back
the
sikhs
will
arrest
me
so
i
ask
you
to
bear
me
witness
that
i
was
compelled
by
threats
and
force
to
go
with
these
people
in
that
way
with
a
little
ingenuity
that
is
to
say
the
ingenious
use
of
piastras
perhaps
i
can
contrive
to
get
out
of
the
difficulty
without
being
punished
by
both
arabs
and
british
i
promised
to
tell
no
more
than
i
had
seen
and
heard
on
the
strength
of
that
we
became
as
fast
friends
as
suspicion
permitted
we
trusted
each
other
because
we
more
or
less
had
to
like
a
couple
of
thieves
on
the
lam
it
suited
me
he
was
a
very
good
interpreter
and
slavishly
anxious
to
please
but
i
lived
to
regret
it
later
when
my
evidence
had
cleared
him
of
collusion
in
the
raid
he
chose
on
the
strength
of
that
to
claim
me
as
his
friend
for
life
he
turned
up
in
the
united
states
and
tried
to
live
on
his
wits
i
had
to
pay
a
lawyer
to
defend
him
in
federal
court
he
writes
me
piously
pathetic
letters
from
leavenworth
penitentiary
and
when
he
gets
out
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
befriend
him
again
however
at
the
moment
he
was
useful
it
was
just
dawn
when
old
anazeh
ran
the
launch
into
a
cove
between
high
rocks
ahmed
let
out
a
shriek
of
anguish
at
the
violence
done
the
hull
they
pitched
the
sheep
overboard
to
wade
ashore
without
remembering
to
untie
its
legs
it
was
almost
drowned
before
it
occurred
to
any
one
to
rescue
it
perhaps
it
was
dead
i
do
know
anyhow
one
fellow
prayed
in
a
hurry
while
his
companion
cut
the
sheep
throat
to
make
it
lawful
meat
god
is
good
old
anazeh
remarked
to
me
and
blessed
be
his
prophet
who
forbade
us
faithful
even
though
we
hunger
to
defile
ourselves
with
the
flesh
of
creatures
whose
blood
did
not
flow
from
the
knife
of
the
slayer
after
that
they
all
prayed
going
first
into
the
asphaltic
water
for
the
ceremonial
washing
they
were
quite
particular
about
it
then
they
spread
facing
mecca
every
single
had
brought
along
his
and
had
treasured
it
as
carefully
as
his
rifle
ahmed
and
i
sat
on
a
rock
and
watched
them
ahmed
pretended
he
wanted
to
pray
too
to
impress
me
he
said
he
was
a
very
devout
christian
and
that
nothing
should
prevent
the
practice
of
his
religion
but
he
was
very
quick
to
take
my
advice
not
to
start
anything
that
might
bring
on
a
breach
of
the
peace
old
short
preliminary
sermon
to
his
followers
about
the
need
of
always
keeping
god
in
mind
was
not
addressed
to
us
prayers
finished
they
proceeded
to
cut
up
and
cook
the
sheep
ahmed
and
i
subdued
the
voice
of
conscience
without
noticeable
effort
and
ate
our
share
of
the
stolen
goods
ahmed
said
that
seeing
how
little
was
left
for
him
when
the
rest
had
all
been
served
he
sinned
only
in
small
degree
but
that
my
share
as
an
honoured
guest
was
huge
and
the
sin
proportionate
so
i
gave
him
some
of
my
meat
and
he
ate
it
and
we
were
equally
sinful
one
more
bond
cementing
an
eternal
friendship
we
had
hardly
finished
eating
when
an
arab
on
a
gray
horse
came
riding
furiously
down
a
ravine
that
looked
like
a
dry
course
he
was
brought
up
fifty
yards
away
every
man
in
the
party
leveled
a
rifle
at
him
anazeh
beckoned
me
to
come
and
get
behind
him
for
protection
he
was
very
angry
when
i
refused
he
cursed
the
language
and
religion
of
whatever
fool
had
taught
me
manners
in
a
land
where
pigs
are
lawful
food
however
after
they
had
all
had
a
good
look
at
the
horseman
they
let
him
draw
near
and
there
followed
a
noisy
conference
the
man
on
the
horse
calling
on
allah
repeatedly
with
emphasis
and
anazeh
and
his
followers
all
doing
the
same
thing
but
from
an
opposing
viewpoint
i
persuaded
ahmed
to
go
up
close
and
listen
the
man
is
from
he
said
presently
while
they
all
still
fought
with
words
using
tremendous
oaths
by
way
of
artillery
a
council
of
the
tribes
has
been
summoned
to
meet
at
but
each
sheikh
is
only
to
take
two
men
with
him
because
of
the
risk
of
fighting
among
themselves
anazeh
says
there
can
be
no
proper
council
without
his
being
present
and
that
he
will
attend
the
council
but
as
for
taking
only
two
men
he
has
pledged
his
word
to
escort
you
with
twenty
men
to
kerak
he
swears
that
he
will
carry
out
that
pledge
even
should
he
have
to
fight
the
whole
way
there
and
back
again
anazeh
suddenly
cut
short
the
war
of
words
his
gesture
suggested
that
of
joshua
who
made
the
sun
stand
still
he
tossed
a
curt
order
to
one
of
his
men
who
went
off
at
a
run
toward
a
village
whose
morning
smoke
rose
blue
over
a
spur
of
the
range
a
mile
away
then
anazeh
sat
down
to
await
events
and
took
no
more
notice
of
the
horseman
arguments
that
did
not
worry
the
horseman
much
he
kept
on
arguing
every
few
minutes
one
of
anazeh
men
would
go
to
him
and
repeat
some
as
if
the
old
sheikh
had
not
heard
it
but
all
he
got
for
his
pains
was
a
gesture
of
contemptuous
dismissal
ahmed
kept
growing
more
and
more
uncomfortable
all
the
time
he
had
attended
to
his
boat
making
it
properly
fast
and
covering
the
engine
under
the
eyes
of
four
men
who
were
at
pains
to
see
that
he
did
not
crank
up
and
desert
now
he
was
back
beside
me
trying
to
bolster
up
his
own
courage
by
making
me
afraid
they
have
determined
to
take
me
along
with
them
to
prevent
me
from
escaping
he
complained
that
man
on
the
horse
is
saying
that
if
more
men
go
with
anazeh
than
you
and
two
others
there
will
certainly
be
fighting
and
anazeh
answers
he
has
pledged
his
word
can
you
not
say
something
to
persuade
anazeh
i
would
rather
have
tried
to
persuade
a
tiger
short
of
knocking
the
old
raider
on
the
head
and
standing
off
his
twenty
ruffians
i
could
not
imagine
a
way
of
turning
him
from
his
set
purpose
and
at
that
i
had
not
a
weapon
of
any
kind
i
was
the
goods
and
the
game
old
sportsman
intended
to
deliver
me
right
side
up
perhaps
but
all
in
one
piece
and
to
the
proper
consignee
i
do
see
anything
to
worry
about
said
i
wait
till
you
hear
the
bullets
ahmed
answered
nevertheless
bullets
or
no
bullets
i
did
not
see
what
i
could
do
about
it
again
i
remembered
grim
advice
do
what
the
leader
of
the
escort
tells
you
i
had
begun
to
feel
sorry
for
ahmed
in
spite
of
his
but
his
fear
was
contagious
and
his
advice
was
worth
listening
to
effendi
you
are
anazeh
guest
he
must
do
as
you
demand
if
you
ask
in
the
name
of
the
most
high
tell
him
therefore
that
you
have
an
urgent
business
in
demand
that
he
send
you
back
with
me
in
my
boat
you
are
not
his
guest
he
would
simply
shoot
you
and
destroy
the
boat
i
answered
it
was
not
more
than
before
i
saw
horses
coming
in
our
direction
from
the
village
at
sight
of
them
the
man
on
the
gray
horse
lost
heart
with
a
final
burst
of
eloquence
in
which
he
spread
his
breast
to
heaven
and
shook
both
fists
in
witness
that
he
was
absolved
and
no
could
rest
on
his
head
he
rode
away
at
top
speed
straight
up
the
ravine
down
which
he
originally
came
the
horses
proved
to
be
a
very
mixed
lot
some
good
some
very
bad
and
some
indifferent
but
again
they
treated
me
as
honoured
guest
and
provided
me
a
mare
with
four
sound
legs
and
nothing
much
the
matter
except
vice
she
came
at
me
with
open
teeth
when
i
tried
to
mount
but
four
men
held
her
and
i
climbed
aboard
somehow
or
other
as
a
horseman
i
am
a
pretty
good
sack
of
potatoes
that
was
the
worst
saddle
i
ever
sat
in
and
anazeh
best
the
stirrups
swung
amidships
so
to
speak
and
whenever
you
tried
to
rest
your
weight
on
them
for
a
moment
they
described
an
arc
toward
the
rear
moreover
you
could
not
sit
well
back
on
the
saddle
to
balance
matters
because
of
the
high
cantle
the
result
whether
you
did
with
stirrups
or
without
them
was
torture
for
anybody
but
an
arab
who
has
notions
of
comfort
all
his
own
they
put
ahmed
on
a
scrub
that
looked
unfit
to
walk
but
proved
well
able
to
gallop
under
his
light
weight
one
of
anazeh
men
took
my
bag
with
a
nod
to
reassure
me
and
without
a
word
we
were
off
anazeh
leading
with
four
stalwarts
who
looked
almost
as
as
himself
six
men
crowding
me
closely
and
the
remainder
bringing
up
the
rear
that
is
the
arab
way
of
doing
things
rush
and
riot
to
begin
with
the
steepness
of
the
stony
ravine
we
rode
up
soon
reduced
the
horses
to
a
walk
after
which
there
was
a
good
deal
of
attention
to
and
a
settling
down
to
the
more
serious
aspects
of
the
adventure
the
escort
began
to
look
sullenly
ferocious
as
only
arabs
can
there
was
a
time
during
the
turkish
regime
before
the
war
when
cook
agency
took
tourists
in
parties
to
and
all
the
protection
necessary
was
a
handful
of
turkish
soldiers
whose
thief
employment
on
the
trip
was
to
gather
fuel
and
pitch
tents
some
one
paid
the
arabs
to
let
tourists
alone
and
they
normally
did
but
the
war
changed
all
that
a
stranger
in
with
leather
boots
was
fair
quarry
for
whoever
had
rifle
or
knife
we
passed
by
a
village
or
two
tucked
into
folds
in
the
hills
and
polluting
the
blue
sky
with
a
smell
of
ageing
dung
but
nothing
seemed
disposed
to
happen
a
few
men
stood
behind
stone
walls
and
stared
at
us
sullenly
the
women
looked
up
from
their
grindstones
at
the
doors
covered
their
faces
for
sake
and
uncovered
them
again
at
once
for
curiosity
there
was
nothing
you
could
call
a
road
between
the
villages
only
a
rocky
that
seemed
to
take
the
longest
possible
way
between
two
points
and
nobody
seemed
to
own
it
or
to
be
there
to
challenge
our
right
of
way
but
suddenly
after
we
had
passed
the
third
village
and
were
walking
the
horses
up
a
shoulder
of
a
steep
three
shots
cracked
out
from
in
front
of
us
to
left
and
right
nobody
fell
but
if
ever
there
was
instantaneous
response
it
happened
then
anazeh
and
his
four
galloped
forward
firing
as
they
rode
for
the
cover
of
a
ridge
one
man
on
the
tipped
me
out
of
the
saddle
so
suddenly
that
i
had
no
chance
to
prevent
him
another
caught
me
and
two
others
flung
me
into
a
hole
behind
a
stone
i
heard
the
scatter
and
run
two
men
pitched
ahmed
down
on
top
of
me
for
he
was
valuable
seeing
he
could
run
an
engine
and
thirty
seconds
later
i
peered
out
around
the
rock
to
get
a
glimpse
of
what
was
happening
there
was
not
a
man
in
sight
i
could
see
some
of
the
horses
standing
under
cover
the
firing
was
so
rapid
that
it
sounded
almost
like
practice
a
hairy
arm
reached
out
and
pushed
my
head
back
and
after
that
whenever
i
made
the
least
movement
a
man
who
was
sniping
from
behind
the
sheltering
rock
swore
furiously
and
threatened
to
brain
me
with
his
beyond
all
doubt
they
regarded
me
as
perishable
freight
so
i
hardly
saw
any
of
the
fighting
judging
by
the
sound
i
should
say
they
fought
their
way
in
skirmish
order
and
when
they
got
to
the
top
the
enemy
whoever
they
were
took
to
flight
but
that
is
guesswork
there
were
two
casualties
on
our
side
one
man
shot
through
the
arm
which
did
not
matter
much
he
was
well
able
to
lie
about
what
had
happened
and
to
boast
of
how
many
men
he
had
slain
before
the
bullet
hit
him
the
other
was
wounded
pretty
seriously
in
the
jaw
they
came
to
me
for
first
aid
taking
it
for
granted
that
i
knew
something
about
surgery
i
do
i
had
a
bad
time
bandaging
both
of
them
using
two
of
my
handkerchiefs
and
strips
from
the
protesting
ahmed
shirt
however
i
enjoyed
it
more
than
they
did
when
anazeh
shouted
at
last
and
we
all
rode
to
the
hilltop
there
was
a
dead
man
lying
there
stripped
naked
with
his
throat
cut
across
from
ear
to
ear
one
of
our
men
was
wiping
a
long
knife
by
stabbing
it
into
the
dirt
there
was
also
a
led
horse
added
to
the
escort
anazeh
looked
very
cool
and
dignified
he
had
an
extra
rifle
now
slung
by
a
strap
across
his
shoulders
he
was
examining
a
bandolier
that
had
blood
on
it
we
rode
on
at
once
and
for
the
next
hour
ahmed
was
kept
busy
interpreting
to
me
the
lies
invented
by
every
member
of
the
escort
for
my
especial
benefit
if
they
were
true
each
man
had
slain
his
dozen
but
nobody
would
say
who
the
opposing
faction
were
when
i
put
that
question
they
all
dried
up
and
nobody
would
speak
again
for
several
minutes
it
turned
out
afterward
that
there
had
been
a
sort
of
armistice
proclaimed
and
all
the
local
chiefs
had
undertaken
to
observe
it
and
cease
from
for
three
days
provided
that
each
chief
should
prove
peaceful
intention
by
bringing
with
him
only
two
men
three
men
in
a
party
and
not
more
than
three
had
right
of
way
the
engagement
may
have
been
a
simple
protest
against
breach
of
the
terms
of
the
armistice
but
i
suspect
there
was
more
than
that
in
it
at
any
rate
we
were
not
attacked
again
on
the
road
although
there
were
men
who
showed
themselves
now
and
then
on
crags
who
eyed
us
suspiciously
and
made
no
answer
to
the
shouted
challenge
of
anazeh
men
when
the
track
passed
over
a
spur
or
swung
round
the
shoulder
of
a
cliff
we
could
sometimes
catch
sight
of
other
parties
always
though
of
three
before
and
behind
us
proceeding
in
the
same
direction
we
sighted
the
stone
walls
of
at
about
midafternoon
and
rode
up
to
the
place
through
a
savage
gorge
that
must
have
been
impregnable
in
the
old
days
of
bows
and
arrows
it
would
take
a
determined
army
today
to
force
itself
through
the
wadys
and
winding
that
guard
that
old
citadel
of
romans
and
crusaders
we
approached
from
the
northwest
corner
where
a
tower
stands
that
they
call
there
were
lions
carved
on
it
it
looked
as
if
the
battlements
had
been
magnificent
at
one
time
but
whatever
the
turks
become
possessed
of
always
falls
into
decay
and
the
arabs
seem
no
better
beside
the
is
a
tunnel
faced
by
an
unquestionable
roman
arch
outside
it
there
were
more
than
a
dozen
armed
men
lounging
and
a
lot
of
others
looked
down
at
us
through
the
ruined
of
the
wall
above
their
leader
challenged
our
numbers
at
once
and
refused
admission
judging
by
magnificently
insolent
reply
it
looked
at
first
as
if
he
intended
fighting
his
way
in
but
that
turned
out
to
be
only
his
diplomatic
manner
establishing
himself
as
it
were
on
an
eminence
from
which
he
could
make
concessions
without
losing
dignity
the
arrangement
finally
agreed
to
was
anazeh
suggestion
but
showed
diplomatic
genius
on
both
sides
the
old
man
divided
up
his
party
into
sets
of
three
and
asserted
that
every
set
of
three
was
independent
there
were
of
us
all
told
including
ahmed
but
he
described
ahmed
as
a
prisoner
and
offered
to
have
him
shot
if
that
would
simplify
matters
there
was
a
great
deal
of
windy
discussion
about
ahmed
fate
during
which
his
face
grew
the
color
of
raw
liver
and
he
joined
in
several
times
tearfully
once
he
was
actually
seized
and
of
the
castle
guards
aimed
at
him
but
they
compromised
finally
by
letting
him
go
in
with
hands
tied
nobody
really
wanted
the
responsibility
of
shooting
a
man
who
had
smuggled
stolen
cartridges
across
the
dead
sea
and
might
do
it
again
if
allowed
to
live
we
rode
for
eighty
or
a
hundred
paces
through
an
echoing
tunnel
into
a
city
of
shacks
and
ruined
houses
that
swarmed
with
armed
men
and
it
was
evident
that
we
were
not
the
only
ones
who
had
ignored
the
rule
about
numbers
anazeh
explained
in
an
aside
to
me
that
only
those
would
obey
that
rule
who
did
not
dare
break
it
whoever
makes
laws
should
be
strong
enough
to
enforce
them
he
said
sagely
and
whoever
obeys
such
a
law
is
at
the
mercy
of
those
who
break
it
he
added
presently
by
way
of
afterthought
to
make
sure
that
i
understood
him
he
repeated
that
remark
three
times
every
house
had
its
quota
of
visitors
who
lounged
in
the
doorways
and
eyed
us
with
mixed
insolence
and
curiosity
there
were
all
over
the
place
that
seemed
to
have
been
erected
for
the
occasion
where
under
awnings
made
of
stick
and
straw
men
sat
with
rifles
on
their
knees
those
who
had
provender
to
sell
for
horses
were
doing
a
roaring
trade
short
measure
and
high
price
and
the
noise
of
grinding
was
incessant
the
women
in
the
back
streets
were
toiling
to
produce
enough
to
eat
for
all
that
host
of
notables
to
have
had
to
hunt
for
quarters
in
that
town
just
then
would
have
been
no
joke
there
was
the
mosque
of
course
where
any
moslem
who
finds
himself
stranded
may
theoretically
go
and
sleep
on
a
mat
on
the
floor
but
we
rode
past
the
mosque
it
was
full
i
would
not
have
liked
a
contract
to
crowd
one
more
in
there
perhaps
a
new
york
subway
guard
could
have
managed
it
the
babel
coming
through
the
open
door
was
like
the
buzzing
of
flies
on
a
garbage
heap
i
was
trying
to
sit
upright
in
that
abominable
saddle
and
look
dignified
as
became
the
honoured
guest
with
a
escort
when
a
wearing
an
amber
necklace
worth
a
forced
his
way
through
a
crowd
and
greeted
anazeh
like
a
long
lost
brother
i
examined
him
narrowly
to
make
sure
he
was
not
grim
in
disguise
but
he
had
two
fingers
missing
and
holes
in
his
ears
which
decided
that
question
after
he
had
welcomed
me
effusively
he
led
us
through
a
maze
of
streets
to
a
house
with
lions
carved
on
the
stone
doorposts
and
a
lot
of
other
marks
of
both
roman
and
crusader
no
part
of
the
walls
was
less
than
three
feet
thick
although
the
upper
story
had
been
rebuilt
rather
recently
on
a
more
economical
and
much
less
dignified
scale
nevertheless
there
was
a
sort
of
air
about
the
place
helped
out
by
two
casemented
projections
overhanging
the
narrow
street
there
was
no
need
to
announce
ourselves
the
clatter
of
hoofs
and
shouts
to
ordinary
folk
on
foot
to
get
out
of
the
way
had
done
that
already
sheikh
ben
nazir
opened
the
door
in
person
his
welcome
to
me
was
the
sort
that
comes
to
mind
when
you
read
the
bible
story
of
the
prodigal
son
returning
from
a
country
i
might
have
been
his
but
perhaps
i
am
wrong
about
that
bloodfeuds
among
are
notoriously
savage
he
was
the
host
and
i
the
guest
among
genuine
arabs
that
is
the
most
binding
relation
there
is
he
was
no
longer
in
blue
serge
and
boots
but
magnificent
in
arab
finery
and
he
was
tricked
out
in
a
puzzling
that
suggested
politics
without
your
knowing
why
he
had
told
me
when
i
met
him
at
the
american
colony
that
he
had
made
the
pilgrimage
to
mecca
more
than
once
but
that
white
linen
thing
had
nothing
to
do
with
his
being
a
haji
any
more
than
the
expensive
rings
on
the
fingers
of
both
hands
had
anything
to
do
with
his
arab
nationality
after
he
had
flattered
and
questioned
me
sufficiently
about
the
journey
to
comply
with
etiquette
i
asked
him
whether
ahmed
might
not
be
untied
the
thong
cutting
the
man
wrists
sheikh
hen
nazir
gave
the
necessary
order
and
it
was
obeyed
at
once
the
rascal
with
the
priceless
amber
necklace
then
led
away
the
escort
ahmed
included
to
some
place
where
they
could
stall
the
horses
and
lest
any
question
of
precedence
should
be
involved
anazeh
and
i
followed
ben
nazir
into
the
house
we
were
not
the
only
guests
there
he
ushered
us
into
a
square
room
in
which
outrageous
imported
furniture
with
gilt
and
tassels
on
it
stood
out
like
loathsome
sores
against
rugs
and
cushions
fit
for
the
great
throne
room
any
good
museum
in
the
world
would
have
competed
to
possess
the
rugs
but
the
furniture
was
the
sort
that
france
sends
eastward
in
the
name
of
culture
stuff
for
savages
to
sit
on
and
be
civilized
while
the
white
man
bears
the
burden
and
collects
the
money
there
were
arabs
reclining
on
two
bastard
settees
who
rose
to
their
feet
as
we
entered
there
was
another
man
sitting
on
a
cushion
in
a
corner
by
himself
who
did
not
get
up
he
wore
a
white
exactly
like
our
host
and
seemed
to
consider
himself
somebody
very
important
indeed
after
one
swift
searching
glance
at
us
he
went
into
a
brown
study
as
if
a
mere
sheikh
and
a
christian
alien
were
beneath
his
notice
we
were
introduced
first
of
all
to
the
men
who
had
stood
up
to
greet
us
and
that
ceremony
took
about
five
minutes
the
arab
believes
he
ought
to
know
all
about
how
you
feel
physically
and
expects
you
to
reciprocate
when
that
was
over
ben
nazir
took
us
to
the
corner
and
presented
first
me
then
anazeh
to
the
solitary
man
in
the
white
who
seemed
to
think
himself
too
important
to
trouble
about
manners
anazeh
did
not
quite
like
my
receiving
attention
first
and
he
liked
still
less
the
way
in
which
the
solitary
man
received
us
we
were
told
his
name
was
suliman
ben
saoud
he
acknowledged
my
greeting
he
and
old
anazeh
glared
at
each
other
barely
moving
their
heads
in
what
might
have
been
an
unspoken
threat
and
retort
or
a
nod
of
natural
recognition
anazeh
turned
on
his
heel
and
joined
the
other
guests
in
some
vague
way
i
knew
that
saoud
was
a
name
to
conjure
with
although
memory
refused
to
place
it
the
man
air
of
indifference
and
apparently
unstudied
insolence
suggested
he
was
some
one
well
used
to
authority
presuming
on
the
one
thing
that
i
felt
quite
sure
of
by
that
time
my
privileged
position
as
a
guest
i
stayed
to
try
to
draw
him
out
i
tried
to
open
up
conversation
with
him
with
english
french
and
finally
lame
arabic
he
took
no
apparent
notice
of
the
french
and
english
but
he
smiled
sarcastically
at
my
efforts
with
his
own
tongue
except
that
he
moved
his
lips
he
made
no
answer
but
went
on
clicking
the
beads
of
a
splendid
amber
rosary
ben
nazir
seeming
to
think
that
anazeh
ruffled
feelings
called
for
smoothing
crossed
the
room
to
engage
him
in
conversation
so
i
was
left
practically
alone
with
the
strange
individual
more
or
less
in
a
spirit
of
defiance
of
his
claim
to
such
distinction
i
sat
down
on
a
cushion
beside
him
he
was
a
man
the
lower
part
of
his
cheek
that
side
on
which
i
sat
was
sunk
in
as
if
he
had
no
teeth
there
the
effect
was
to
give
his
whole
face
a
twisted
appearance
the
greater
part
of
his
head
of
course
was
concealed
by
the
flowing
white
kaffiyi
but
his
skin
was
considerably
darker
than
that
of
the
palestine
arab
he
had
no
eyebrows
at
all
having
shaved
them
off
for
a
vow
i
supposed
instead
of
making
him
look
comical
as
you
might
expect
it
gave
him
a
very
sinister
appearance
which
was
increased
by
his
generally
surly
attitude
once
again
as
when
i
had
entered
the
room
he
turned
his
head
to
give
me
one
swift
minutely
searching
glance
and
then
turned
his
eyes
away
as
if
he
had
no
further
interest
they
were
quite
extraordinary
eyes
brimful
of
alert
intelligence
and
whereas
from
his
general
appearance
i
should
have
set
him
down
at
somewhere
between
forty
and
fifty
his
eyes
suggested
youth
or
else
that
keen
unpeaceful
spirit
that
never
ages
i
tried
him
again
in
arabic
but
he
answered
without
looking
at
me
in
a
dialect
i
had
never
heard
before
so
i
offered
him
a
cigarette
that
being
a
universal
language
he
waived
the
offer
aside
with
something
between
astonishment
and
disdain
he
had
lean
hands
entirely
unlike
those
of
the
desert
fraternity
who
live
too
hard
and
fight
too
frequently
to
have
soft
uncalloused
skin
and
unbroken
he
did
not
exactly
fascinate
me
his
was
annoying
it
seemed
intended
to
convey
an
intellectual
and
moral
importance
that
i
was
not
disposed
to
concede
without
knowing
more
about
him
i
suppose
an
arab
feels
the
same
sensation
when
a
westerner
lords
it
over
him
on
highly
moral
grounds
at
any
rate
something
or
other
in
the
way
of
pique
urged
me
to
stir
him
out
of
his
just
as
one
feels
urged
to
prod
a
to
watch
him
jump
he
seemed
to
understand
my
remarks
for
he
took
no
trouble
to
hide
his
amusement
at
my
efforts
with
the
language
but
he
only
answered
in
monosyllables
and
i
could
not
understand
those
so
after
about
five
minutes
i
gave
it
up
and
crossed
the
room
to
ben
nazir
who
seized
the
opportunity
to
show
me
my
it
proved
to
be
a
room
like
a
monastery
cell
up
one
flight
of
stone
steps
with
two
other
rooms
of
about
the
same
size
on
either
side
of
it
at
the
end
of
the
passage
was
a
very
heavy
wooden
door
with
an
iron
lock
and
an
enormous
keyhole
which
i
suppose
shut
off
the
harem
from
the
rest
of
the
house
but
as
i
never
trespassed
beyond
it
i
do
know
i
only
do
know
that
a
woman
eye
was
watching
me
through
that
and
ben
nazir
frowned
impatiently
at
the
sound
of
female
giggling
the
sheikh
anazeh
will
have
the
room
on
this
side
of
you
he
said
and
the
sheikh
suliman
ben
saoud
the
room
on
the
other
so
you
will
be
between
friends
suliman
ben
saoud
seems
a
difficult
person
to
make
friends
with
i
answered
ben
nazir
smiled
like
a
prince
out
of
a
beautiful
white
teeth
and
exquisite
benignance
oh
you
must
mind
him
these
celebrities
from
the
centre
of
arabia
give
themselves
great
airs
to
do
that
is
considered
evidence
of
piety
and
wisdom
i
sat
on
the
bed
quite
a
civilized
affair
spotlessly
clean
ben
nazir
took
the
chair
i
suppose
like
the
considerate
host
he
was
to
give
me
the
sensation
of
receiving
in
my
own
room
he
wears
the
same
sort
of
you
do
what
does
it
mean
i
asked
i
wear
mine
out
of
compliment
to
him
not
that
i
have
not
always
the
right
to
wear
it
it
is
the
ichwan
it
is
highly
significant
of
what
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
then
seemed
to
make
up
his
mind
that
it
did
not
much
matter
what
he
might
divulge
to
an
ignorant
stranger
soon
to
return
to
the
united
states
it
is
difficult
to
explain
you
americans
know
so
little
of
our
politics
it
is
significant
i
might
say
of
the
new
arabia
arabia
for
the
arabs
the
great
ben
saoud
who
is
a
relative
of
this
man
is
an
arabian
chieftain
who
has
welded
most
of
arabia
into
one
and
now
challenges
king
hussein
of
mecca
for
the
caliphate
hussein
is
only
kept
on
his
throne
by
british
gold
paid
to
him
from
india
ben
saoud
also
receives
a
subsidy
from
the
british
who
must
continue
to
pay
it
because
otherwise
ben
saoud
will
attack
hussein
and
overwhelm
him
that
it
is
believed
would
mean
a
rising
of
all
the
moslem
world
against
their
rulers
in
africa
asia
india
java
everywhere
it
began
as
a
religious
movement
it
is
now
political
although
it
is
held
together
by
religious
zeal
you
might
say
that
the
ichwans
are
the
modern
protestants
of
islam
they
are
fanatical
the
world
has
never
seen
such
fanaticism
and
the
movement
spreads
day
by
day
you
do
look
like
a
fanatic
i
said
and
he
laughed
again
i
god
forbid
but
i
am
a
politician
and
to
succeed
a
politician
must
have
friends
among
all
parties
my
one
ambition
is
to
see
all
arabs
united
in
an
independent
state
reaching
from
this
coast
to
the
persian
gulf
to
that
end
i
devote
my
energy
i
use
all
means
available
including
money
paid
me
by
the
french
who
have
no
intention
of
permitting
any
such
development
if
they
can
help
it
and
the
british
for
the
present
we
must
make
use
of
them
also
but
their
yoke
must
go
eventually
then
if
america
had
accepted
the
near
east
mandate
you
would
have
used
us
in
the
same
way
certainly
that
would
have
been
the
easiest
way
because
america
understands
little
or
nothing
of
our
politics
money
america
schools
and
hospitals
america
war
munitions
and
then
i
am
willing
to
use
all
means
all
methods
to
the
one
end
arabia
for
the
arabs
after
that
i
am
willing
to
retire
into
oblivion
nevertheless
ben
nazir
did
not
convince
me
that
he
was
an
altruist
who
had
no
private
ends
to
serve
there
was
an
avaricious
gleam
in
ben
nazir
eyes
chapter
five
mind
if
i
use
you
for
all
his
care
to
seem
hospitable
before
any
other
consideration
ben
nazir
looked
ill
at
ease
he
led
me
down
again
to
a
hung
with
spears
shields
scimitars
and
ancient
pistols
but
furnished
otherwise
like
an
apartment
he
watched
while
a
man
set
food
before
me
it
seemed
that
anazeh
had
gone
away
somewhere
to
eat
with
his
men
ben
nazir
restlessness
became
so
obvious
that
i
asked
at
last
whether
i
was
not
detaining
him
he
jumped
at
the
opening
with
profound
apologies
he
asked
me
to
excuse
him
for
the
remainder
of
the
afternoon
you
see
he
explained
i
came
from
damascus
to
jerusalem
so
i
was
rather
out
of
touch
with
what
was
going
on
here
this
conference
of
notables
was
rather
a
surprise
to
me
it
will
not
really
take
place
until
tomorrow
but
there
are
important
details
to
attend
to
in
advance
if
you
could
amuse
yourself
the
man
who
could
not
do
that
in
a
crusader
city
crammed
with
sons
of
ishmael
who
looked
as
if
they
had
stepped
out
of
the
pages
of
the
old
testament
would
be
difficult
to
please
i
asked
for
ahmed
to
act
as
interpreter
ben
nazir
volunteered
to
provide
me
with
two
men
in
addition
as
a
sort
of
bodyguard
because
ahmed
is
a
person
who
is
not
respected
it
did
not
take
ten
minutes
to
produce
ahmed
and
the
two
men
the
latter
were
solemn
veterans
armed
with
rifles
and
long
knives
with
them
at
my
heels
i
set
out
to
explore
there
is
nothing
to
see
said
ahmed
who
did
not
want
to
come
but
ahmed
was
a
liar
there
was
everything
to
see
the
only
definite
purpose
i
had
in
mind
was
to
find
grim
it
was
possible
i
might
recognize
him
even
through
his
disguise
failing
that
he
could
not
help
but
notice
me
if
i
walked
about
enough
if
so
he
would
find
his
own
means
of
establishing
communication
but
you
might
as
well
have
hunted
for
one
particular
pebble
on
a
beach
as
for
a
single
individual
in
all
that
throng
remembering
grim
disguise
when
i
first
saw
him
i
naturally
had
that
picture
of
him
in
mind
but
all
the
bedouins
looked
about
as
much
alike
as
peas
in
a
pod
they
stared
at
me
as
if
i
were
a
curio
on
exhibition
but
they
did
not
like
being
stared
back
at
there
was
no
hint
of
violence
or
interference
and
no
apparent
resentment
of
an
alien
presence
in
their
midst
the
lunged
bodyguard
shouted
out
to
all
and
sundry
to
make
way
for
the
amerikani
and
way
was
made
forthwith
although
several
times
the
bodyguard
was
stopped
and
questioned
after
i
had
passed
to
make
sure
i
was
really
american
and
not
english
ahmed
assured
me
that
if
i
had
been
english
they
would
have
massacred
me
in
view
of
what
transpired
he
may
have
been
right
though
i
doubt
it
they
might
have
held
me
as
hostage
not
that
they
were
in
any
kind
of
mood
there
was
a
man
dead
body
hanging
by
one
foot
from
a
great
hook
on
a
high
wall
and
the
wall
was
splattered
with
blood
and
chipped
by
bullets
i
asked
ahmed
what
kind
of
criminal
he
might
be
he
did
not
agree
with
them
they
are
for
war
he
was
in
favor
of
peace
and
he
made
a
speech
two
hours
ago
so
they
accused
him
of
being
a
traitor
and
he
was
tried
and
condemned
who
tried
him
everybody
did
war
with
whom
i
asked
the
british
why
because
they
favor
the
zionists
and
that
is
what
the
conference
is
all
about
yes
there
is
a
man
here
from
damascus
who
urges
them
to
raid
across
the
jordan
into
palestine
he
says
that
the
palestinian
arabs
will
rise
then
and
cut
the
throats
of
all
the
zionists
he
says
that
emir
feisul
is
going
to
attack
the
french
in
syria
and
that
the
british
will
have
to
go
and
help
the
french
so
now
is
the
time
for
a
raid
is
my
host
ben
nazir
the
man
who
is
talking
that
way
he
has
been
to
damascus
no
another
named
abdul
ali
a
very
rich
sheikh
who
comes
here
often
with
caravans
of
merchandise
and
gives
rich
presents
to
notables
has
ben
nazir
anything
to
do
with
it
who
knows
mashallah
the
world
is
full
of
mysteries
that
nazir
is
a
knowing
one
they
say
of
him
whichever
option
is
uppermost
that
is
always
his
opinion
he
is
a
safe
man
to
follow
for
that
reason
yet
it
is
easier
to
follow
water
through
a
channel
underground
we
made
our
way
toward
the
castle
at
the
south
side
of
the
town
but
were
prevented
from
entering
by
a
guard
of
feudal
retainers
who
looked
as
if
they
had
been
well
drilled
they
were
as
solemn
as
the
vultures
that
sat
perched
along
the
rampart
overlooking
a
great
artificial
moat
dividing
the
town
from
the
high
hill
just
beyond
it
nobody
interfered
when
i
climbed
on
the
broken
town
wall
and
looked
over
the
castle
wall
sloped
down
steeply
into
the
moat
suggesting
ample
space
within
for
dungeons
and
underground
passages
but
there
was
nothing
else
there
of
much
interest
to
see
only
dead
donkeys
a
dying
camel
with
the
vultures
already
beginning
on
him
some
dead
dogs
heaps
of
refuse
and
a
lot
more
vultures
too
gorged
to
fly
the
usual
arab
scheme
of
sanitation
i
asked
one
of
my
bodyguard
to
shoot
the
camel
and
he
obliged
me
with
the
air
of
a
keeper
making
concessions
to
a
lunatic
nobody
took
any
notice
of
the
rifle
going
off
it
was
when
we
turned
back
into
the
town
again
that
the
first
inkling
of
grim
presence
in
the
place
turned
up
a
looking
arab
in
a
sheepskin
coat
that
stank
of
sweat
so
vilely
that
you
could
hardly
bear
the
man
near
you
came
up
and
stood
in
my
way
barring
the
smell
he
was
a
rascal
truculent
swaggering
but
possessed
of
a
smile
that
seemed
to
say
sure
i
a
rogue
and
a
liar
but
what
else
did
you
expect
he
spoke
perfectly
good
english
he
said
he
wished
to
speak
to
me
alone
that
was
easy
enough
ahmed
and
the
bodyguard
withdrew
about
ten
paces
and
he
and
i
stepped
into
a
doorway
i
am
mahommed
ben
hamza
he
said
with
his
head
on
one
side
as
if
that
explanation
ought
to
make
everything
clear
to
me
at
once
from
hebron
he
added
when
i
did
not
seem
to
see
the
light
the
wiser
one
looks
and
the
less
one
says
in
arab
lands
the
less
trouble
there
likely
to
be
i
tried
to
look
extremely
wise
and
said
nothing
where
is
jimgrim
he
demanded
if
you
can
tell
me
that
i
give
you
ten
piastres
i
answered
i
will
give
you
fifty
if
you
tell
me
why
do
you
want
to
know
he
is
my
friend
he
said
i
should
see
him
here
but
i
have
not
seen
him
he
said
also
i
should
see
you
you
are
the
amerikani
and
you
do
know
where
he
is
truly
then
when
you
see
him
will
you
say
to
him
ben
hamza
is
here
with
nine
men
at
the
house
of
abu
shamah
jimgrim
will
understand
i
nodded
and
the
man
from
hebron
walked
away
without
another
word
did
he
steal
your
watch
asked
ahmed
they
are
as
jealous
as
children
those
arabs
there
was
a
second
execution
while
i
walked
back
through
the
city
a
poor
devil
with
slobber
on
his
jaws
came
tearing
with
a
mob
at
his
heels
we
stepped
into
an
alley
to
let
the
race
go
by
but
he
doubled
down
the
alley
opposite
before
he
had
run
twenty
yards
along
it
some
one
hit
the
back
of
his
head
with
a
piece
of
rock
a
second
later
they
had
pounced
on
him
and
in
less
than
a
minute
after
that
he
was
kicking
in
the
noose
of
a
hide
rope
slung
over
a
i
do
know
what
they
hanged
him
for
no
one
apparently
knew
but
they
used
his
carcase
for
a
target
and
shot
it
almost
to
pieces
i
kept
on
looking
for
grim
although
the
task
seemed
hopeless
of
course
i
could
not
give
a
hint
of
my
real
purpose
but
as
grim
knew
that
the
talk
about
a
was
my
passport
to
the
place
it
seemed
possible
that
he
might
use
that
as
an
excuse
for
getting
in
touch
with
me
so
i
told
ahmed
to
show
me
the
schools
they
were
worth
looking
at
mere
sheds
in
which
moslem
boys
were
taught
to
say
the
koran
by
heart
the
places
where
christian
missionaries
once
had
been
were
all
turned
into
stores
and
even
into
stables
for
the
horses
of
the
notables
so
i
returned
to
ben
nazir
house
and
found
old
sheikh
anazeh
sitting
outside
on
the
step
as
motionless
as
a
indian
but
twice
as
picturesque
he
still
had
his
own
rifle
over
his
knees
and
the
plundered
one
slung
over
his
shoulder
by
a
strap
he
never
stirred
abroad
unarmed
i
asked
him
what
the
conference
of
notables
was
going
to
be
about
and
he
told
me
to
mind
my
own
business
that
struck
me
as
an
excellent
idea
so
not
having
slept
at
all
the
previous
night
i
went
upstairs
and
lay
on
the
bed
there
was
no
lock
on
the
door
so
i
set
the
chair
against
it
ben
nazir
was
a
man
who
had
traveled
a
great
deal
and
picked
up
western
notions
of
hospitality
to
add
to
the
inborn
eastern
sense
of
sacredness
in
the
relation
between
host
and
guest
it
seems
that
an
hour
or
two
later
he
came
to
take
me
down
to
a
gargantuan
meal
but
feeling
the
chair
against
the
door
and
hearing
snores
he
decided
it
was
better
manners
to
let
me
lie
in
peace
so
i
did
not
wake
up
again
until
after
midnight
the
moonlight
was
streaming
through
a
little
window
and
fell
on
the
figure
of
a
man
who
sat
with
crossed
legs
on
the
end
of
the
bed
i
thought
i
was
dead
and
in
hell
that
is
no
picturesque
exaggeration
about
a
man
hair
standing
when
he
is
terrified
it
really
does
i
would
have
yelled
aloud
if
the
breath
would
have
come
but
there
is
a
trick
of
sudden
fear
that
seems
to
grip
your
lungs
and
hold
them
impotent
the
thing
on
the
end
of
the
bed
had
no
it
grinned
as
if
it
knew
all
about
evil
and
were
hungry
and
living
men
were
its
food
i
do
know
how
long
i
stared
at
the
thing
but
it
seemed
like
a
week
at
last
it
spoke
and
i
burst
into
a
sweat
with
the
reaction
good
job
you
do
know
how
to
fasten
a
door
with
a
chair
have
to
show
you
that
trick
or
you
be
dying
before
your
time
do
make
a
noise
i
sat
up
and
looked
more
closely
at
him
it
was
the
ichwan
of
the
afternoon
sheikh
suliman
ben
saoud
and
he
was
speaking
unmistakable
american
i
began
again
to
believe
i
was
dreaming
he
chuckled
quietly
and
lit
a
cigarette
are
you
wise
to
me
yet
grim
who
else
but
what
happened
to
your
face
you
all
oh
that
easy
i
just
take
out
my
false
teeth
the
rest
is
done
with
a
razor
and
some
brown
stain
i
thought
you
were
going
to
spot
me
when
you
first
came
did
you
i
did
think
so
did
you
act
as
well
as
all
that
no
looked
all
over
town
for
you
afterward
i
thought
that
was
too
natural
to
be
acting
pick
up
any
news
in
town
saw
a
hanging
and
met
a
man
who
calls
himself
mahommed
ben
hamza
he
waiting
at
the
house
of
abu
shamah
any
men
with
him
nine
three
more
than
he
promised
ben
hamza
is
the
most
honest
thief
and
dependable
liar
in
palestine
a
cheerful
murderer
who
sticks
closer
than
a
brother
i
saved
him
once
from
being
hung
because
he
smiles
so
nicely
any
more
news
i
expect
none
that
you
do
know
there
a
sheikh
named
abdul
ali
from
damascus
preaching
a
raid
into
palestine
grim
nodded
i
here
to
bag
that
bird
where
do
i
come
in
i
asked
you
are
the
plausible
excuse
that
all
thanks
to
you
old
anazeh
got
into
with
twenty
men
two
might
not
have
been
enough
even
with
ben
hamza
and
his
nine
then
our
host
ben
nazir
is
in
on
your
game
not
he
up
at
headquarters
in
jerusalem
we
knew
all
about
this
coming
conference
these
folk
are
ready
to
explode
the
only
way
to
stop
it
is
to
pull
the
plug
the
plug
is
abdul
ali
we
knew
we
could
count
on
old
anazeh
but
the
puzzle
was
how
to
get
him
and
his
men
into
when
you
told
me
ben
nazir
had
invited
you
i
saw
the
way
to
do
it
there
was
anybody
else
except
anazeh
that
ben
nazir
could
have
sent
to
fetch
you
and
the
old
boy
is
a
dependable
friend
of
ours
that
did
not
stop
him
from
raiding
two
villages
on
the
british
side
of
the
dead
sea
i
answered
did
he
sure
i
had
part
of
a
raided
sheep
for
breakfast
well
of
all
the
damn
his
impudence
the
shrewd
old
devil
must
have
figured
that
we
ca
get
after
him
for
it
seeing
how
he
playing
our
game
bloody
old
well
he
gets
away
with
it
this
time
you
have
to
be
mighty
careful
not
to
seem
to
recognize
me
one
slip
and
we
done
for
you
safe
enough
if
they
once
get
wise
to
me
pull
me
in
pieces
between
four
horses
what
your
plan
it
vague
yet
got
to
be
an
opportunist
i
supposed
to
be
a
member
of
the
ben
saoud
family
recruiting
members
for
the
new
sect
biggest
thing
in
arabia
i
invited
to
the
conference
on
the
strength
of
my
supposed
connection
with
the
big
ichwan
movement
propose
to
murder
this
abdul
ali
person
then
or
have
him
murdered
i
asked
murder
out
of
my
line
besides
do
no
good
worse
than
useless
they
all
cut
loose
abdul
ali
has
got
them
together
what
with
bribes
and
a
lot
of
promises
he
has
them
keen
on
this
raid
if
he
were
killed
they
say
one
of
our
spies
did
it
they
add
vengeance
to
their
other
motives
which
at
present
are
mainly
a
desire
for
loot
no
no
abdul
ali
has
got
to
disappear
then
they
believe
he
has
betrayed
them
then
instead
of
raiding
palestine
they
confiscate
his
property
and
curse
his
ancestors
see
the
point
more
or
less
but
what
good
can
i
do
do
you
mind
if
i
use
you
i
laughed
that
a
hell
of
a
silly
question
any
use
my
minding
you
already
used
me
you
will
do
it
again
without
consulting
me
i
like
it
as
it
happens
but
a
fat
lot
you
care
whether
i
like
it
or
not
is
it
a
bit
late
in
the
day
to
ask
permission
oh
well
you
know
the
hangmen
always
used
to
beg
the
pardon
will
you
obey
orders
yes
but
it
might
be
easier
if
i
know
what
i
doing
as
soon
as
i
know
i
explain
he
answered
where
you
can
fit
into
the
puzzle
at
the
moment
is
by
rooting
for
the
school
idea
the
worst
robber
chieftain
from
the
farthest
cluster
of
huts
he
calls
his
home
town
would
like
to
see
an
american
school
here
in
if
there
were
one
he
send
his
sons
to
it
okay
i
root
like
a
dog
for
a
buried
bone
go
to
it
that
gives
you
the
right
to
ask
questions
that
will
oblige
ben
nazir
to
introduce
you
to
any
one
you
want
to
interview
that
will
explain
without
any
further
argument
whatever
weakness
you
seem
to
have
for
talking
to
men
in
the
street
like
mahommed
ben
hamza
it
would
even
explain
away
any
politeness
that
i
might
show
you
in
my
capacity
of
ichwan
for
safety
sake
and
to
create
an
impression
i
take
the
line
of
being
rude
to
every
one
but
i
might
reasonably
toss
a
few
crumbs
of
condescension
to
an
altruist
from
foreign
parts
at
any
rate
i
have
to
take
that
chance
get
me
you
mean
you
use
me
as
intermediary
messages
to
and
from
ben
hamza
and
that
sort
of
thing
that
the
idea
but
there
more
to
it
did
you
bring
that
bible
along
are
you
superstitious
any
notions
like
long
john
silver
about
its
being
bad
luck
to
spoil
a
bible
all
right
keep
it
in
your
pocket
to
make
notes
in
if
you
ca
get
the
whole
book
to
me
tear
a
page
out
and
send
that
or
give
it
to
me
with
the
message
spelled
in
dots
under
the
words
make
the
dots
faint
i
good
eyes
what
sort
of
notes
do
you
want
from
me
you
must
mistake
me
for
the
prophet
ezekiel
he
answered
grinning
saith
the
lord
is
all
right
when
you
know
what
you
talking
about
all
i
know
for
certain
is
that
i
got
to
bag
abdul
ali
if
you
get
information
that
looks
important
to
you
get
it
to
me
in
the
way
i
told
you
that
all
do
be
caught
talking
to
me
do
look
friendly
seem
interested
what
else
if
you
can
keep
old
anazeh
sober
oh
grim
nodded
meaningly
i
known
easier
jobs
the
old
sport
thinks
no
more
of
me
than
of
an
express
package
he
been
hired
to
deliver
i
answered
drunk
or
sober
brush
me
aside
like
a
fly
well
wits
were
given
us
to
use
i
guess
you
have
to
use
yours
have
you
any
how
the
hell
should
i
know
i
retorted
if
you
find
i
have
any
do
blame
me
i
wo
he
answered
and
i
believed
him
what
else
besides
being
to
the
king
of
the
amalekites
i
asked
do
trust
ahmed
he
a
good
interpreter
yeh
and
a
poor
peg
you
have
to
use
him
some
but
trust
him
does
old
anazeh
know
you
in
that
disguise
i
asked
no
and
he
must
i
tell
you
why
all
these
people
are
religious
fanatics
a
horrible
death
is
the
only
fate
they
would
consider
for
a
man
caught
masquerading
as
a
holy
personage
the
way
i
doing
but
their
fanaticism
has
a
way
of
petering
out
when
the
gang
not
there
to
see
in
his
own
village
i
think
anazeh
would
laugh
if
i
talked
this
ruse
over
with
him
afterwards
but
if
he
knew
about
it
here
with
all
these
other
fanatics
alert
and
fanning
he
would
dare
not
to
expose
me
it
a
good
job
you
asked
that
if
i
send
any
message
to
anazeh
through
you
be
sure
you
do
give
me
away
how
shall
i
make
him
believe
the
message
is
from
you
then
begin
with
says
he
recognize
the
formula
but
if
he
questions
that
say
lion
knows
a
lion
in
the
dark
that
serve
a
double
purpose
convince
him
and
jog
his
memory
he
ignored
a
request
of
mine
once
and
i
was
able
to
get
back
at
him
tell
you
the
story
some
day
nowadays
he
more
or
less
dependable
unless
he
gets
a
of
redeye
well
make
the
most
of
your
chance
to
sleep
you
may
have
to
go
short
later
i
going
to
saw
off
a
cord
or
two
myself
he
left
the
room
as
silently
as
a
ghost
i
do
doubt
that
he
slept
peacefully
subsequent
acquaintance
with
him
convinced
me
that
he
can
go
to
sleep
almost
anywhere
in
any
circumstances
and
that
is
a
very
great
gift
for
it
enables
its
owner
to
wear
down
any
dozen
who
must
sleep
for
stated
hours
at
fixed
intervals
grim
snatches
his
whenever
the
chance
comes
and
goes
without
with
apparent
indifference
he
told
me
once
that
he
dreams
nearly
all
the
time
he
is
asleep
but
the
dreams
seem
to
trouble
him
i
believe
he
dreams
out
the
key
to
whatever
problem
puzzles
him
at
the
moment
my
own
sleep
was
done
for
that
night
his
advice
notwithstanding
i
lay
listening
to
anazeh
thunderous
snores
and
naturally
enough
imagining
every
possible
contingency
and
dozens
that
were
totally
impossible
nothing
turned
out
in
the
least
like
any
of
my
forecasts
but
that
was
not
for
want
of
trying
to
foresee
it
all
i
do
seem
to
possess
any
of
that
quiet
gift
of
waiting
to
deal
with
each
development
on
its
merits
as
and
when
it
comes
i
have
to
speculate
and
speculation
is
the
ene
my
of
peace
looking
back
i
do
think
i
felt
a
bit
afraid
of
the
immediate
future
but
that
was
due
to
ignorance
of
nearly
all
that
the
present
held
i
think
that
was
part
of
grim
reason
for
helping
me
to
reach
in
the
first
place
he
counted
on
my
ignorance
of
danger
to
keep
me
it
is
true
it
did
dawn
on
me
that
if
my
host
were
to
suspect
me
of
intriguing
under
cover
of
his
protection
the
protection
might
cease
with
disconcerting
abruptness
i
realized
to
some
extent
what
a
predicament
that
would
be
but
on
the
whole
i
think
the
only
real
worry
was
the
definite
task
grim
had
given
me
the
thankless
and
very
likely
desperate
inglorious
one
of
trying
to
keep
old
anazeh
sober
of
course
the
koran
forbids
wine
but
whiskey
is
not
wine
and
if
you
mix
whiskey
and
wine
together
they
cease
to
be
either
they
become
a
commodity
of
which
the
prophet
knew
nothing
and
which
he
therefore
did
not
forbid
but
if
you
introduce
such
a
mixture
into
the
stomach
and
thence
into
the
brain
of
an
already
fiery
bedouin
and
then
introduce
the
bedouin
to
trouble
and
if
in
addition
to
the
trouble
you
provide
impertinent
alien
and
what
he
calls
infidel
restraint
it
is
fair
to
presume
that
the
mixture
might
explode
it
seemed
to
me
i
had
been
given
too
much
to
do
in
order
to
get
introductions
to
the
notables
i
must
first
get
ben
nazir
into
a
proper
frame
of
mind
then
stammering
in
an
alien
tongue
i
must
make
friends
with
chieftains
who
had
never
even
heard
of
me
and
that
when
their
minds
were
busy
with
another
matter
i
must
keep
in
touch
with
ben
hamza
and
convey
his
messages
to
grim
without
being
seen
or
arousing
suspicion
in
addition
to
all
that
i
must
keep
sober
by
some
means
an
old
savage
armed
with
two
rifles
and
a
knife
who
had
twenty
at
his
beck
and
call
while
i
pondered
the
problem
in
all
its
impossible
bearings
loud
snores
to
right
and
left
of
me
tenor
and
bass
by
turns
announced
that
jimgrim
and
anazeh
were
as
blissfully
oblivious
to
my
worries
as
the
bedbugs
were
that
had
come
out
of
hiding
and
discovered
me
i
began
to
feel
homesick
chapter
six
that
man
will
repay
study
i
got
my
first
shot
at
anazeh
at
dawn
when
the
muezzin
began
wailing
over
the
city
and
i
missed
badly
with
both
barrels
the
old
sheikh
looked
into
my
room
presumably
to
see
if
i
was
still
alive
since
he
had
guaranteed
to
see
me
safely
back
again
across
the
jordan
before
rounding
up
his
rascals
for
morning
prayer
they
prayed
together
whenever
possible
anazeh
keeping
count
of
their
genuflections
you
could
tell
he
had
been
drinking
the
night
before
the
minute
he
thrust
his
head
into
the
room
he
smelt
like
the
lees
of
a
rum
barrel
and
the
rims
of
his
eyes
were
red
seeing
i
was
awake
he
gave
me
the
courteous
allah
ysabbhak
bilkhair
and
i
asked
him
where
he
had
dined
the
night
before
he
mumbled
something
into
his
beard
that
i
could
not
catch
but
he
could
not
have
told
me
much
more
plainly
to
go
to
hell
even
in
plain
english
however
i
had
to
get
a
foothold
somewhere
so
i
said
that
i
had
heard
that
the
liquor
in
was
poisonous
as
far
as
i
understood
his
answer
he
implied
that
it
likely
would
be
poisonous
in
the
sort
of
place
where
i
would
buy
it
but
that
he
anazeh
need
not
be
told
how
to
suck
eggs
by
any
such
a
greenhorn
as
me
i
tried
him
again
i
said
that
liquor
taken
in
quantity
would
kill
a
man
so
will
one
bullet
he
answered
but
whereas
a
bullet
in
the
belly
causes
pain
before
death
moiyit
ilfadda
aqua
fortis
causes
pleasure
and
a
man
dies
either
way
he
turned
to
go
rattling
two
against
the
door
but
i
had
one
last
try
to
get
on
terms
and
said
i
hoped
to
see
him
at
breakfast
or
shortly
afterward
god
is
the
giver
both
of
eyesight
and
the
things
to
see
he
answered
i
go
to
pray
god
will
guide
my
footsteps
afterward
i
did
not
feel
i
had
really
made
much
headway
but
i
fared
rather
better
with
my
host
downstairs
who
either
did
not
pray
with
such
enthusiasm
or
else
had
forestalled
the
muezzin
at
any
rate
he
was
waiting
for
me
near
a
table
spread
with
sweet
cakes
and
good
french
coffee
after
the
usual
string
of
pleasantries
he
became
suddenly
confidential
the
part
a
little
as
a
man
does
who
has
something
rather
disagreeable
up
his
sleeve
that
he
means
to
spring
on
you
presently
i
have
been
busy
since
an
hour
before
dawn
i
have
been
consulting
with
my
friend
suliman
ben
saoud
the
situation
here
is
very
serious
as
long
as
you
are
my
guest
you
are
perfectly
safe
but
if
i
were
to
send
you
away
the
assembled
notables
might
suspect
you
of
being
a
spy
and
might
accuse
me
of
harbouring
a
spy
do
you
see
they
would
suppose
you
were
returning
to
jerusalem
with
information
for
the
british
that
would
have
most
unpleasant
consequences
for
both
of
us
clearly
grim
in
the
guise
of
ben
saoud
had
been
busy
and
it
was
up
to
me
to
seize
my
cue
alertly
i
was
at
pains
to
look
alarmed
ben
nazir
grew
solicitous
rest
assured
you
are
safe
as
my
guest
but
suliman
ben
saoud
was
annoyed
to
think
a
stranger
should
be
here
at
such
a
time
as
this
he
took
me
to
task
about
you
he
is
also
my
guest
as
i
reminded
him
but
he
is
a
truculent
fellow
he
insisted
that
the
assembled
notables
have
the
right
to
satisfaction
regarding
your
bona
fides
it
was
no
use
my
saying
as
i
did
repeatedly
that
i
personally
guarantee
you
he
asked
me
how
much
i
know
about
you
i
had
to
confess
that
what
i
actually
know
amounts
to
very
little
well
i
said
what
does
the
old
grouch
want
he
thinks
that
you
should
be
presented
to
the
assembled
notables
at
noon
today
in
fact
he
demands
that
they
should
catechize
you
regarding
your
ideas
about
a
school
i
have
no
objection
but
i
am
sorry
to
have
to
add
this
it
is
probable
the
notables
will
insist
on
your
remaining
in
until
after
that
shall
have
taken
place
which
they
have
been
summoned
to
decide
on
they
will
not
risk
your
returning
before
the
before
what
the
ah
they
contemplate
a
raid
so
i
a
prisoner
no
no
mon
dieu
what
do
you
think
of
me
even
the
fanatical
suliman
ben
saoud
saw
the
force
of
the
argument
when
i
spoke
of
the
sanctity
of
any
guest
here
on
my
invitation
but
he
thinks
and
i
agree
with
him
that
as
a
precaution
you
should
first
call
on
sheikh
abdul
ali
you
will
find
him
a
very
agreeable
man
who
will
receive
you
with
proper
courtesy
he
is
here
from
damascus
and
exercises
a
great
influence
once
his
mind
is
at
ease
about
you
he
will
satisfy
all
the
others
are
you
agreeable
why
not
so
we
smoked
a
cigarette
together
after
the
coffee
and
then
set
forth
on
foot
for
the
distance
was
not
great
preceded
and
surrounded
by
armed
retainers
i
imagine
the
armed
men
were
more
for
the
sake
of
appearance
than
protection
ben
nazir
seemed
popular
but
the
escort
drove
other
pedestrians
out
of
the
way
as
roughly
as
they
did
the
unspeakable
dogs
that
infested
every
the
street
that
we
followed
was
of
course
the
open
sewer
for
the
houses
on
either
hand
and
its
condition
was
a
credit
to
the
mangy
curs
that
so
resented
our
intrusion
abdul
ali
house
if
his
it
was
was
a
fairly
big
square
building
near
the
middle
of
the
town
it
did
not
look
unlike
one
of
the
new
york
precinct
stations
with
its
big
windows
protected
by
iron
grilles
and
a
flight
of
stone
steps
leading
up
to
a
door
exactly
in
the
middle
of
the
front
wall
there
were
thirty
or
forty
men
hanging
about
the
place
abdul
ali
owned
more
than
one
camel
caravan
and
every
man
connected
with
the
business
looked
on
himself
as
a
member
of
one
big
feudal
family
they
were
all
armed
most
of
them
had
modern
rifles
we
were
admitted
into
a
room
that
faced
on
the
street
furnished
entirely
in
the
eastern
style
except
for
two
gilt
chairs
against
the
wall
the
walls
were
hung
with
carpets
and
the
floor
was
covered
with
bokhara
rugs
three
deep
no
doubt
in
order
to
emphasize
his
own
importance
abdul
ali
kept
us
waiting
in
that
room
for
ten
minutes
before
he
condescended
to
enter
but
when
he
did
come
at
last
he
was
at
pains
to
seem
agreeable
which
was
not
quite
his
natural
attitude
i
had
never
seen
a
more
offensive
personality
although
at
the
first
glance
he
did
not
arouse
actual
dislike
distaste
for
him
dawned
and
grew
he
was
certainly
not
physically
attractive
although
the
syrian
arab
costume
made
him
picturesque
the
first
thing
i
noticed
was
the
fatness
of
his
hands
those
of
a
giver
of
dishonest
gifts
when
he
shook
hands
you
felt
in
some
subtle
way
that
he
was
sure
your
conscience
was
for
sale
that
he
would
purchase
it
for
any
reasonable
figure
and
that
he
believed
he
had
plenty
of
money
with
which
to
buy
you
and
all
your
relatives
he
was
a
little
puffy
under
the
eyes
had
a
firm
mouth
rather
thick
lips
and
his
small
black
moustache
was
turned
up
like
the
kaiser
which
gave
him
a
cockily
appearance
for
the
rest
he
was
a
rather
person
although
his
flowing
robe
partly
concealed
that
stockily
rather
than
heavily
built
and
of
rather
more
than
middle
height
he
wore
one
ring
a
sapphire
of
extraordinary
brilliance
of
which
he
was
immensely
proud
when
i
noticed
it
he
said
at
once
that
it
had
been
given
him
by
the
late
sultan
abdul
hamid
he
spoke
german
from
choice
so
we
conversed
in
german
which
annoyed
ben
nazir
who
could
not
understand
a
word
of
it
and
from
first
to
last
throughout
that
interview
and
subsequently
to
the
point
where
jimgrim
and
him
he
relied
on
the
german
philosophy
of
that
teaches
how
to
get
and
keep
the
upper
hand
by
making
yourself
believe
in
your
own
and
then
speaking
acting
making
plans
in
logical
accord
with
that
belief
it
works
finely
until
somebody
spoils
the
whole
thing
by
pricking
the
bladder
and
letting
out
all
the
wind
although
he
spoke
german
he
was
not
by
any
means
in
his
motives
he
was
at
pains
to
make
that
clear
evidently
he
had
been
once
until
he
saw
the
writing
on
the
wall
he
was
conscious
of
the
need
to
offset
past
prejudices
before
suggesting
his
enormous
ability
along
advanced
lines
you
come
at
an
interesting
time
he
said
you
find
us
in
transition
before
the
war
and
almost
until
the
end
of
it
most
arabs
believed
in
the
german
destiny
english
gold
commanded
the
allegiance
of
an
arab
army
but
every
last
man
in
that
army
was
ready
to
follow
the
german
standard
at
the
proper
time
that
only
shows
how
ignorant
these
people
are
as
soon
as
it
became
evident
that
the
arab
destiny
lies
in
the
hands
of
arabs
themselves
most
of
them
immediately
began
to
clamour
for
an
american
mandate
because
that
would
give
them
temporary
masters
who
could
protect
them
yet
at
the
same
time
who
would
be
too
ignorant
of
real
conditions
to
prevent
secret
preparations
for
a
revolt
all
very
absurd
of
course
he
had
no
idea
how
absurd
he
himself
appeared
he
launched
into
a
tirade
designed
to
make
him
seem
a
in
the
eyes
of
a
stranger
who
did
not
care
what
he
was
the
more
he
talked
himself
into
a
delirium
of
the
less
his
character
impressed
me
i
even
ran
into
the
danger
of
him
because
he
liked
himself
so
much
i
here
to
look
into
the
prospects
for
a
school
i
said
yes
yes
very
estimable
you
shall
have
my
support
he
paused
for
me
to
fawn
on
him
and
my
neglect
to
do
it
spurred
him
to
further
you
must
look
to
me
for
support
if
you
hope
for
success
there
is
no
cohesion
here
without
me
i
am
the
only
man
in
to
whom
they
all
listen
and
even
i
have
difficulty
in
uniting
them
at
times
but
a
school
is
a
good
idea
and
under
my
auspices
you
will
succeed
for
the
moment
i
thought
he
suspected
me
of
wanting
to
teach
school
myself
i
hastened
to
correct
the
impression
all
i
promise
to
do
is
to
tell
people
in
the
states
who
might
be
interested
exactly
he
had
been
coming
at
this
point
all
along
in
his
own
way
so
there
is
no
hurry
it
makes
no
difference
that
you
must
stay
in
a
little
longer
than
you
intended
you
shall
be
presented
to
the
council
of
notables
under
my
auspices
in
my
judgment
it
is
important
that
you
remain
here
for
some
little
time
i
suppose
the
men
who
can
analyze
their
thoughts
and
separate
the
wise
impulses
from
the
rash
ones
are
the
people
whom
the
world
calls
men
of
destiny
and
whom
history
later
assigns
to
its
halls
of
fame
the
rest
of
us
simply
act
from
pique
prejudice
passion
or
whatever
other
emotion
is
in
charge
i
know
i
did
it
was
resentment
it
was
so
immensely
disagreeable
to
be
patronized
by
this
sensualist
that
i
could
not
resist
the
impulse
to
argue
with
him
i
do
see
the
force
of
that
said
i
my
plans
are
made
to
return
to
jerusalem
tomorrow
i
could
not
have
done
better
as
it
happened
i
suppose
there
is
some
theory
that
has
been
written
down
in
books
to
explain
how
these
things
work
at
any
rate
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
fellow
who
wrote
the
book
but
grim
referring
to
it
afterward
called
it
naked
luck
i
would
rather
agree
with
grim
than
argue
with
any
inky
theorist
on
earth
having
seen
too
many
theories
upset
luck
looks
to
me
like
a
sweeter
lady
and
more
worshipful
than
any
of
the
goddesses
they
rename
nowadays
and
then
dissect
in
clinics
at
any
rate
by
naked
luck
i
prodded
abdul
ali
where
he
kept
his
supply
of
mistakes
instead
of
calling
my
bluff
as
he
doubtless
should
have
done
he
set
out
to
win
me
over
to
his
point
of
view
whichever
way
you
analyze
it
in
the
light
of
subsequent
events
the
only
possible
conclusion
is
that
it
was
my
turn
to
be
lucky
and
abdul
ali
to
make
a
fool
of
himself
nobody
could
have
made
a
fool
of
him
better
than
he
did
i
must
dissuade
you
he
said
trying
to
hide
wilfulness
under
an
unpleasant
smile
i
will
offer
inducements
they
have
to
be
heavy
i
said
to
weigh
against
what
i
have
in
mind
he
had
kept
ben
nazir
and
me
standing
all
this
time
now
he
offered
me
one
of
the
chairs
took
the
other
himself
and
motioned
ben
nazir
to
a
cushion
near
the
window
a
servant
brought
in
the
inevitable
coffee
and
cigarettes
then
he
laid
a
hand
on
my
knee
for
special
emphasis
a
fat
pale
unprincipled
hand
with
that
great
sapphire
gleaming
on
the
middle
finger
it
happens
that
this
idea
of
a
school
comes
just
at
the
right
moment
i
have
been
searching
my
mind
for
just
some
such
idea
to
lay
before
the
notables
as
we
are
talking
a
language
that
none
else
here
understands
i
can
safely
take
you
into
confidence
a
raid
is
being
planned
into
british
territory
he
paused
to
let
that
sink
in
and
tapped
my
knee
with
his
disgusting
fingers
until
i
could
have
struck
him
from
irritation
there
is
however
an
element
of
disagreement
there
is
uncertainty
as
to
the
outcome
in
the
minds
of
some
of
the
chiefs
who
live
nearest
to
the
border
the
feeling
among
them
is
that
perhaps
i
am
urging
them
on
in
order
to
serve
my
own
ambition
at
their
expense
they
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
loot
but
they
say
that
the
british
will
hit
back
afterwards
and
they
being
nearest
to
the
border
will
suffer
most
whereas
i
stand
to
gain
all
and
to
lose
nothing
very
absurd
of
course
but
that
is
their
argument
surely
i
said
you
do
expect
me
to
take
my
coat
off
and
preach
a
jihad
against
the
british
im
gotteswillen
no
no
no
this
is
my
meaning
if
i
can
go
before
them
with
the
offer
of
a
school
for
which
the
very
worst
scoundrel
among
them
desires
with
all
his
ignorant
heart
and
if
i
can
produce
a
distinguished
gentleman
from
america
present
among
them
on
my
invitation
for
the
sole
purpose
of
making
the
arrangements
for
such
a
school
that
will
convince
them
that
i
have
their
interests
really
at
heart
do
you
see
again
the
irritating
fingers
drumming
on
my
knee
i
did
not
answer
for
fear
of
betraying
i
am
a
statesman
sir
i
understand
the
arguments
with
which
whole
nations
may
deceive
themselves
i
have
made
it
my
profession
to
detect
the
trends
of
thought
and
the
tides
of
unrest
psychological
moments
are
for
me
a
fascinating
study
i
can
recognize
them
he
laid
the
fat
hand
on
my
shoulder
for
a
change
and
tried
to
look
into
my
eyes
but
i
was
watching
the
edge
of
a
curtain
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
now
to
you
an
american
our
local
dispute
means
nothing
this
raid
is
no
affair
of
yours
you
wash
your
hands
of
it
you
an
altruist
are
interested
only
in
a
school
i
offer
you
opportunity
building
subsidy
guarantees
you
reciprocate
by
giving
me
a
talking
point
i
shall
make
use
of
the
opportunity
that
is
settled
and
let
me
see
i
promised
you
inducements
did
i
he
looked
at
me
and
i
looked
at
him
he
waited
for
a
hint
of
some
sort
but
i
made
no
move
to
help
him
out
what
shall
we
say
i
was
as
interested
in
the
result
of
his
appraisal
as
he
was
in
making
it
whether
complimentary
or
not
another
calculated
judgment
of
your
character
is
a
fascinating
thing
to
wait
for
i
think
you
will
be
getting
full
value
i
shall
introduce
you
to
all
the
notables
he
said
at
last
to
a
man
of
your
temperament
it
will
be
a
privilege
to
attend
the
council
and
to
know
in
advance
all
that
is
going
to
happen
there
will
be
no
objection
to
that
because
it
is
already
decided
you
will
remain
in
until
after
the
er
raid
the
notables
will
understand
from
me
that
your
mouth
is
sealed
until
after
the
event
you
shall
be
let
into
our
secrets
there
is
that
not
equitable
it
was
shrewd
i
did
not
believe
for
a
minute
that
he
would
let
me
into
all
their
secrets
but
he
could
not
have
imagined
a
greater
temptation
for
me
since
i
would
not
have
taken
his
word
that
black
was
not
white
i
did
not
hesitate
to
pretend
to
agree
to
his
terms
i
must
have
an
interpreter
i
said
otherwise
i
shall
understand
very
little
i
will
supply
you
an
interpreter
a
good
one
no
thank
you
any
man
of
yours
might
only
tell
me
what
he
thought
correct
for
me
to
hear
if
i
to
get
a
price
for
my
services
i
want
the
full
price
i
want
to
hear
everything
i
must
be
allowed
to
bring
my
own
interpreter
who
would
he
be
i
do
know
yet
that
man
ahmed
for
instance
i
have
been
told
he
is
one
of
your
party
ahmed
would
do
very
well
no
not
ahmed
who
then
i
will
find
a
man
he
hesitated
if
ever
a
man
was
reviewing
all
the
possible
contingencies
murder
of
me
included
behind
a
mask
of
superficial
courtesy
that
man
was
he
he
should
be
a
man
acceptable
to
the
notables
he
said
at
last
i
ought
to
know
his
name
in
advance
i
must
have
unfettered
choice
or
i
wo
attend
the
mejlis
council
oh
very
well
only
the
interpreter
too
will
have
to
remain
afterward
in
i
looked
at
that
curtain
again
for
it
was
moving
in
a
way
that
no
draft
from
the
open
window
could
account
for
but
at
last
the
movement
was
explained
before
abdul
ali
could
speak
again
a
man
stepped
out
from
behind
it
crossed
the
room
and
went
out
through
the
door
closing
it
silently
behind
him
he
was
a
man
i
knew
and
the
last
man
i
had
expected
to
see
in
that
place
i
suppose
abdul
ali
noticed
my
look
of
surprise
you
know
him
he
asked
by
sight
he
was
at
sheikh
ben
nazir
house
yesterday
that
is
suliman
ben
saoud
a
stranger
from
arabia
but
a
man
of
great
influence
because
of
his
connection
with
the
ichwan
movement
if
you
are
interested
in
our
types
that
man
will
repay
study
good
i
try
to
study
him
said
i
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
keep
a
straight
face
so
jimgrim
was
the
source
of
abdul
ali
inspirations
i
wondered
what
subtle
argument
he
could
have
used
to
make
the
sheikh
so
keen
on
baiting
his
hook
with
the
school
proposal
his
nerve
in
waiting
behind
that
curtain
until
he
knew
his
scheme
had
succeeded
and
then
walking
out
bold
as
brass
to
let
me
know
that
he
had
overheard
everything
was
what
amused
me
but
i
managed
not
to
smile
what
time
is
the
mejlis
i
asked
at
noon
then
i
go
and
hunt
up
my
interpreter
ben
nazir
came
out
with
me
in
a
blazing
bad
temper
he
was
as
jealous
as
a
pet
dog
and
inclined
to
visit
the
result
on
me
very
polite
i
am
sure
most
refined
most
courteous
in
your
country
sir
does
a
guest
reward
his
host
for
hospitality
by
talking
in
a
language
that
his
host
ca
understand
perhaps
you
would
rather
transfer
your
presence
to
abdul
ali
house
pray
do
not
consider
yourself
beholden
to
me
in
case
you
would
prefer
his
hospitality
i
tried
in
vain
to
pacify
him
i
explained
that
the
choice
of
language
had
been
abdul
ali
and
offered
to
tell
him
now
in
french
every
word
that
had
passed
but
he
would
not
listen
it
would
not
be
difficult
for
a
man
of
your
intelligence
to
make
up
a
story
he
said
rudely
abdul
ali
can
talk
french
if
it
had
been
intended
that
i
should
know
the
truth
that
conversation
would
have
been
in
french
shall
i
send
your
bag
to
abdul
ali
house
no
i
said
give
it
to
anazeh
he
is
answerable
for
my
safety
until
i
reach
palestine
again
thank
you
for
a
night
lodging
he
walked
away
in
a
great
huff
and
i
set
out
for
the
house
of
abu
shamah
using
my
scant
store
of
arabic
to
ask
the
way
mahommed
ben
hamza
was
lolling
on
the
stone
veranda
gossiping
with
men
he
came
the
minute
i
beckoned
him
i
seen
jimgrim
i
said
you
to
come
with
me
at
noon
to
the
mejlis
as
my
interpreter
he
grinned
delightedly
and
see
here
you
smelly
devil
here
money
buy
yourself
a
clean
shirt
a
new
coat
and
some
soap
wash
yourself
from
head
to
foot
and
put
the
new
clothes
on
before
you
meet
me
at
the
castle
gate
ten
minutes
before
noon
those
are
jimgrim
orders
do
you
understand
taht
yours
to
command
he
answered
laughing
i
went
and
bought
myself
an
awful
meal
at
the
house
of
a
man
who
rolled
kabobs
between
his
filthy
fingers
chapter
seven
who
gives
orders
to
me
the
wonderful
thing
about
moab
is
that
everything
happens
in
a
setting
with
illustrations
by
maxfield
parrish
and
wyeth
and
joe
coll
and
all
the
rest
of
them
whichever
way
you
look
imagine
a
blue
sky
so
and
pure
that
you
can
see
against
it
the
very
feathers
in
the
tails
of
wheeling
kites
and
know
that
they
are
brown
not
black
imagine
all
the
houses
and
the
shacks
between
them
and
the
poles
on
which
the
burlap
awnings
hang
painted
on
flat
canvas
and
stood
up
against
that
infinite
blue
stick
some
vultures
in
a
row
along
a
purplish
bronze
they
look
between
the
tiles
and
sky
add
yellow
camels
gray
horses
striped
robes
long
rifles
and
a
searching
smell
and
there
you
have
from
the
inside
from
any
point
along
the
broken
walls
or
the
castle
roof
you
can
see
for
fifty
miles
over
scenery
invented
by
the
with
the
jordan
like
a
blue
worm
in
the
midst
of
hills
twiggling
into
a
turquoise
sea
the
villains
stalk
and
off
again
sublimely
aware
of
their
setting
the
horses
prance
the
camels
saunter
the
very
compose
themselves
for
a
nap
in
the
golden
sun
all
in
perfect
harmony
with
the
piece
a
woman
walking
with
a
stone
jar
on
her
head
or
just
as
likely
a
kerosene
can
looks
as
if
she
had
just
stepped
out
of
eternity
for
the
sake
of
the
picture
and
not
all
the
kings
and
kaisers
cardinals
and
courtezans
rolled
into
one
great
swaggering
splurge
of
majesty
could
hold
a
candle
to
a
ragged
bedouin
chief
on
a
pony
on
the
way
to
a
mejlis
so
it
was
worth
a
little
inconvenience
and
quite
a
little
risk
to
see
those
chiefs
arrive
at
the
castle
gate
toss
their
reins
to
a
brother
and
swagger
in
the
poorest
and
least
important
timing
their
arrival
when
they
could
just
in
advance
of
an
important
man
so
as
to
take
precedence
of
him
and
delay
his
entrance
mindful
of
my
charge
to
keep
anazeh
sober
and
more
deadly
afraid
of
it
than
of
all
the
other
risks
i
hung
about
waiting
for
him
hoping
he
would
arrive
before
abdul
ali
or
ben
nazir
i
wanted
to
go
inside
and
be
seated
before
either
of
those
gentry
came
but
not
a
bit
of
it
i
saw
anazeh
ride
up
at
the
head
of
his
twenty
men
halt
at
a
corner
and
ask
a
question
his
men
were
in
military
order
and
looked
not
only
ready
but
anxious
to
charge
the
crowd
and
establish
their
old
chief
importance
mahommed
ben
hamza
not
quite
so
smelly
in
his
new
clothes
was
standing
at
my
elbow
sheikh
anazeh
beckons
you
he
said
so
the
two
of
us
worked
our
way
leisurely
through
the
crowd
toward
the
down
which
anazeh
had
led
his
party
we
found
them
looking
very
spruce
and
savage
four
abreast
drawn
up
in
the
throat
of
an
alley
old
anazeh
sitting
his
horse
at
their
head
like
a
symbol
of
the
ancient
order
waiting
to
assault
the
new
my
horse
was
close
beside
him
held
by
ahmed
acting
servitor
on
foot
the
old
man
let
loose
the
vials
of
his
wrath
on
me
the
minute
i
drew
near
and
mahommed
ben
hamza
took
delicious
pleasure
in
translating
word
for
word
is
that
the
way
an
effendi
in
my
care
should
be
seen
at
such
a
time
on
foot
am
i
a
that
you
do
not
ride
is
the
horse
not
good
enough
devil
i
made
ben
hamza
explain
that
i
was
to
attend
the
mejlis
as
sheikh
abdul
ali
guest
but
that
only
increased
his
wrath
so
said
ben
nazir
shall
a
lousy
damascene
trick
me
out
of
keeping
my
oath
you
are
in
my
safekeeping
until
you
tread
on
british
soil
again
and
my
honour
is
concerned
in
it
no
doubt
that
effeminate
schemer
of
schemes
would
like
to
display
you
at
the
mejlis
as
his
booty
but
you
are
mine
did
you
think
you
are
not
under
obligation
to
me
i
answered
pretty
tactfully
i
said
that
allah
had
undoubtedly
created
him
to
be
a
protector
of
helpless
wayfarers
and
the
very
guardian
of
honour
mahommed
ben
hamza
added
to
the
compliments
while
rendering
mine
into
arabic
but
though
anazeh
wrath
was
somewhat
mollified
he
was
not
satisfied
by
any
means
am
i
a
dog
he
demanded
that
i
should
be
slighted
for
the
sake
of
that
damascene
it
looked
to
me
like
the
proper
moment
to
try
out
magic
formula
you
are
the
father
of
lions
and
a
lion
knows
a
lion
in
the
dark
said
i
the
effect
was
instantaneous
he
puffed
his
cheeks
out
in
astonishment
and
sucked
them
in
again
the
overbearing
anger
vanished
as
he
leaned
forward
in
the
saddle
to
scrutinize
my
face
it
was
clear
that
he
thought
my
use
of
that
phrase
might
just
possibly
have
been
an
accident
jimgrim
says
ah
what
says
jimgrim
who
are
you
that
know
where
he
is
a
lion
knows
a
lion
in
the
dark
i
said
again
that
there
might
be
no
mistake
about
my
having
used
the
words
deliberately
he
nodded
praised
be
allah
blessings
upon
his
prophet
what
says
jimgrim
jimgrim
says
i
am
to
keep
by
anazeh
and
watch
him
lest
he
drink
strong
drink
and
lose
his
honour
by
becoming
like
a
beast
without
decency
or
understanding
mount
your
horse
effendi
sit
beside
me
i
complied
ben
hamza
took
the
place
of
ahmed
who
went
to
the
rear
looking
rather
pleased
to
get
out
of
the
limelight
what
else
says
jimgrim
asked
anazeh
there
will
be
a
message
presently
providing
sheikh
anazeh
keeps
sober
to
say
that
i
was
enjoying
the
game
by
this
time
is
like
trying
to
paint
heaven
with
a
you
got
to
be
on
the
inside
of
an
intrigue
before
you
can
appreciate
the
thrill
of
it
nobody
who
has
not
had
the
chance
to
mystify
a
leader
of
cheerful
murderers
in
a
city
packed
with
conspirators
with
the
shadow
of
a
vulture
on
the
road
in
front
and
fanged
death
waiting
to
be
let
loose
need
talk
to
me
of
excitement
well
and
good
said
anazeh
when
jimgrim
speaks
i
listen
can
you
beat
that
have
you
ever
dreamed
you
were
possessed
of
some
magic
formula
like
open
sesame
and
free
to
work
with
it
any
miracle
you
choose
was
the
dream
good
i
was
awake
on
a
horse
in
a
real
eastern
alley
with
twenty
thieves
as
picturesque
as
ali
baba
itching
for
action
behind
me
abdul
ali
of
damascus
thinks
he
will
enter
the
mejlis
last
and
create
a
great
sensation
said
anazeh
that
son
of
infamies
deceives
himself
i
shall
enter
last
i
shall
bring
you
there
will
be
no
doubt
who
is
important
just
as
he
spoke
there
clattered
down
the
street
at
right
angles
to
us
a
regular
cavalcade
of
horsemen
led
by
no
less
than
abdul
ali
with
a
sycophant
on
either
hand
cardinal
wolsey
or
some
other
wisehead
once
remarked
that
a
king
is
known
by
the
splendour
of
his
servants
abdul
ali
parasites
were
dressed
for
their
part
in
silk
and
mounted
on
beautiful
white
arab
horses
so
severely
bitted
that
they
could
not
help
but
prance
abdul
ali
on
the
other
hand
played
more
a
role
dark
and
sinister
in
contrast
to
their
finery
on
a
dark
brown
horse
that
trotted
in
a
with
manner
he
rode
in
the
german
military
style
and
if
you
can
imagine
the
kaiser
in
arab
military
with
high
black
riding
boots
showing
under
a
brown
cloak
you
have
his
description
fairly
closely
the
upturned
moustaches
and
the
scowl
increased
the
suggestion
and
i
think
that
was
deliberate
a
dog
offspring
of
dogs
curse
his
religion
and
his
bed
growled
anazeh
in
my
ear
the
old
sheikh
allowed
his
enemy
plenty
of
time
to
judge
by
the
way
the
men
behind
us
gathered
up
their
reins
and
closed
in
they
would
have
liked
to
spoil
abdul
ali
afternoon
by
riding
through
his
procession
and
breaking
its
formation
but
anazeh
had
his
mind
set
and
they
seemed
to
know
better
than
to
try
to
change
it
for
him
we
waited
until
noises
in
the
street
died
down
and
then
ahmed
was
sent
to
report
on
developments
abdul
ali
has
gone
into
the
mejlis
and
the
doors
are
closed
he
announced
five
minutes
later
that
seemed
to
suit
anazeh
perfectly
for
his
eyes
lit
up
with
satisfaction
evidently
being
excluded
from
the
council
was
his
meat
and
drink
he
gave
no
order
but
rode
forward
and
his
men
followed
as
a
snake
tail
follows
its
head
four
abreast
each
man
holding
his
rifle
as
best
suited
him
that
gave
them
a
much
more
warlike
appearance
than
if
they
had
imitated
the
western
model
of
exact
conformity
we
rode
toward
the
castle
at
a
walk
between
very
interested
spectators
who
knew
enough
to
make
way
without
being
told
and
at
the
castle
gate
we
were
challenged
by
a
man
on
foot
who
commanded
about
twice
our
number
of
armed
guards
the
hour
is
passed
he
announced
the
order
is
to
admit
no
who
gives
orders
to
me
anazeh
retorted
it
was
agreed
by
all
the
notables
i
did
not
agree
wallah
thou
dog
of
a
devil
say
you
i
am
not
a
notable
nevertheless
open
that
gate
they
opened
it
two
of
the
men
began
to
do
it
even
before
their
chief
gave
the
reluctant
order
anazeh
started
to
ride
through
with
his
men
crowding
behind
but
that
it
seemed
was
altogether
too
much
liberty
to
take
with
the
arrangements
shouting
all
together
the
surged
in
to
take
hold
of
bridles
and
force
anazeh
dependents
back
teeth
and
eyes
flashed
it
looked
like
the
makings
of
a
fight
no
retainers
allowed
within
the
gate
principals
only
roared
the
captain
of
the
guard
in
arabic
that
sounded
like
explosions
of
boiling
oil
anazeh
mahommed
ben
hamza
and
i
were
already
within
the
courtyard
four
of
anazeh
followers
made
their
way
through
after
us
before
any
one
could
prevent
them
at
that
moment
there
came
a
tremendous
clattering
of
hoofs
and
the
crowd
outside
the
gate
scattered
this
and
that
way
in
front
of
about
a
hundred
of
the
other
chiefs
dependents
who
had
dutifully
stayed
outside
and
had
sought
shade
some
little
distance
off
whether
the
sudden
disturbance
rattled
him
or
whether
he
supposed
that
all
the
other
truculent
ruffians
were
going
to
try
to
follow
our
example
at
any
rate
the
man
on
duty
lost
his
head
and
shouted
to
his
men
to
shut
the
gate
again
before
they
could
do
it
every
one
of
anazeh
gang
had
forced
his
way
through
there
we
all
were
on
forbidden
ground
with
a
great
gate
slammed
and
bolted
behind
us
to
judge
by
the
row
outside
the
keepers
of
the
gate
had
got
their
hands
full
in
front
of
us
was
a
short
flight
of
stone
steps
and
another
great
wooden
door
set
in
stone
posts
under
a
roman
arch
there
were
only
two
armed
men
leaning
against
it
they
eyed
anazeh
and
our
numbers
nervously
open
anazeh
could
use
his
voice
like
a
they
fumbled
with
the
great
bolt
and
obeyed
swinging
the
door
wide
i
thought
for
a
minute
that
my
arrogant
old
protector
meant
to
ride
up
the
steps
and
through
the
door
into
the
mejlis
hall
with
all
his
men
but
he
was
not
quite
so
as
that
after
a
good
long
look
through
the
door
i
suppose
to
make
sure
there
was
no
ambush
inside
waiting
for
him
he
dismounted
and
ordered
his
men
to
occupy
a
across
the
courtyard
from
which
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
dislodge
them
without
a
siege
then
when
he
had
seen
the
last
man
disappear
into
it
he
led
me
and
mahommed
ben
hamza
up
the
steps
ben
hamza
was
grinning
like
a
schoolboy
beside
himself
with
delight
at
the
prospect
of
elbowing
among
notables
as
well
as
inordinately
proud
of
his
new
clothes
and
the
smell
of
imported
soap
that
hung
about
him
like
an
aura
but
anazeh
looked
like
an
ancient
king
entering
into
his
own
surely
there
was
never
another
man
who
could
stride
so
majestically
and
seem
so
conscious
of
his
own
ability
to
override
all
law
we
passed
under
the
shadowy
arch
and
down
a
cool
stone
passage
to
yet
another
heavy
door
that
barred
our
way
anazeh
thundered
on
it
with
his
for
there
were
no
attendants
there
to
do
his
bidding
there
was
no
answer
only
a
murmur
of
voices
within
so
he
thundered
again
and
this
time
the
door
opened
about
six
inches
a
face
peered
through
the
opening
cautiously
and
asked
what
was
wanted
what
is
this
asked
anazeh
is
a
mejlis
held
without
my
presence
since
when
you
are
too
late
the
face
disappeared
some
one
tried
to
close
the
door
anazeh
foot
prevented
open
he
demanded
the
butt
of
his
rifle
thundered
again
on
the
wood
there
was
a
babel
of
voices
inside
followed
by
sudden
silence
anazeh
made
a
sign
to
mahommed
ben
hamza
and
me
we
all
three
laid
our
shoulders
against
the
door
and
shoved
hard
evidently
that
was
not
expected
it
swung
back
so
suddenly
that
we
were
hard
put
to
it
to
keep
our
feet
the
man
who
had
opened
the
door
lay
prone
on
the
floor
in
front
of
us
with
his
legs
in
the
air
and
anazeh
laughed
at
him
the
bitterest
sign
of
disrespect
one
arab
can
pay
to
another
since
when
does
the
word
of
a
damascene
exclude
an
honourable
sheikh
from
a
mejlis
in
asked
anazeh
standing
in
the
doorway
he
was
in
no
hurry
to
enter
the
dramatic
old
ruffian
understood
too
well
the
value
of
the
impression
he
made
standing
there
the
room
was
crowded
with
about
eighty
men
seated
on
mats
and
cushions
with
a
piece
of
carpeted
floor
left
unoccupied
all
down
the
centre
a
room
with
beautifully
vaulted
ceiling
and
a
mullioned
window
from
which
most
of
the
glass
was
gone
the
walls
were
partly
covered
with
persian
and
other
mats
but
there
was
almost
no
furniture
other
than
and
little
inlaid
tables
on
which
to
rest
and
matches
the
air
was
thick
with
smoke
already
and
the
draft
from
the
broken
windows
wafted
it
about
in
streaky
clouds
every
face
in
the
room
was
turned
toward
anazeh
i
kept
as
much
as
possible
behind
him
for
you
ca
look
dignified
in
that
setting
if
all
you
have
on
is
a
stained
golf
suit
that
you
have
slept
in
it
seemed
all
right
to
me
to
let
the
old
sheikh
have
all
the
limelight
but
he
knew
better
perhaps
my
erstwhile
host
ben
nazir
had
understood
a
little
german
after
all
more
likely
he
had
divined
abdul
ali
purpose
to
make
use
of
me
certainly
he
had
poured
the
proper
poison
in
anazeh
ear
and
the
old
man
understood
my
value
to
a
nicety
he
took
me
by
the
arm
and
led
me
in
mahommed
ben
hamza
following
like
a
dog
that
was
too
busy
wagging
its
tail
to
walk
straight
you
would
have
thought
anazeh
and
i
were
father
and
son
by
the
way
he
leaned
toward
me
and
found
a
way
for
me
among
the
crowded
cushions
he
had
no
meek
notions
about
choosing
a
low
place
expecting
to
be
taken
at
his
own
valuation
he
chose
a
high
place
to
begin
with
there
were
several
unoccupied
cushions
near
the
door
and
there
were
servants
busy
in
a
corner
with
pots
and
cakes
he
prodded
one
of
the
servants
and
ordered
him
to
take
two
cushions
to
a
place
he
pointed
out
up
near
the
window
close
to
abdul
ali
there
was
no
room
there
that
was
the
seat
of
the
mighty
you
could
not
have
dropped
a
handkerchief
between
the
men
who
wanted
to
be
nearest
the
throne
of
influence
but
anazeh
solved
that
riddle
he
strode
stately
and
magnificent
up
the
middle
of
the
carpet
amid
a
mutter
of
imprecations
and
when
one
more
than
ordinarily
indignant
sheikh
demanded
to
know
what
he
meant
by
it
he
paused
in
front
of
him
and
laid
his
right
hand
on
my
shoulder
there
was
a
loaded
rifle
in
his
left
who
offers
indignity
to
a
distinguished
guest
he
demanded
the
question
was
addressed
to
everybody
in
the
room
he
took
care
they
were
all
aware
of
it
his
stern
eyes
traveled
from
face
to
face
my
men
who
escorted
him
here
are
outside
the
door
they
can
enter
and
escort
him
away
if
there
are
none
here
who
understand
how
to
treat
the
stranger
in
our
midst
there
was
all
over
me
and
i
did
not
even
try
to
look
unembarrassed
a
man
wits
if
he
has
any
work
swiftly
when
he
looks
like
being
torn
to
pieces
at
a
moment
notice
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
less
insolent
i
appeared
the
less
likely
they
were
to
vent
their
wrath
on
me
i
tried
to
look
as
if
i
understand
i
was
intruding
as
if
i
expected
a
welcome
good
anazeh
whispered
in
my
ear
you
do
well
there
was
a
murmur
of
remonstrance
the
sheikh
who
had
dared
to
rebuke
anazeh
found
the
resentment
turned
against
himself
somebody
told
him
sharply
to
mend
his
manners
anazeh
shrewd
old
opportunist
promptly
directed
the
servant
to
place
cushions
on
the
edge
of
the
carpet
in
front
of
the
first
row
of
those
who
wished
to
appear
important
that
obliged
the
front
rank
to
force
the
men
behind
them
backward
closer
to
the
wall
so
that
room
could
be
made
for
us
without
our
trespassing
on
the
forbidden
gangway
so
i
sat
down
in
the
front
row
five
cushions
from
abdul
ali
anazeh
squatted
beside
me
with
his
rifle
across
his
knees
then
mahommed
ben
hamza
forced
himself
down
between
me
and
the
man
on
my
left
using
his
left
elbow
pretty
generously
and
making
the
best
of
the
edges
of
two
cushions
as
far
as
i
could
see
there
were
not
more
than
other
men
in
the
room
who
had
rifles
with
them
although
all
had
daggers
and
some
wore
curved
scimitars
with
hilts
as
soon
as
i
could
summon
sufficient
nerve
to
look
about
me
and
meet
the
brown
conjecturing
eyes
that
did
not
seem
to
know
whether
to
resent
my
presence
or
be
simply
curious
i
caught
the
eye
of
suliman
ben
saoud
in
the
front
row
opposite
ten
or
twelve
cushions
nearer
the
door
than
where
i
sat
he
did
not
seem
to
notice
me
the
absence
of
eyebrows
made
his
face
expressionless
he
did
even
vaguely
resemble
the
major
james
grim
whom
i
knew
him
to
be
when
his
eyes
met
mine
there
was
no
symptom
of
recognition
if
he
felt
as
nervous
as
i
did
he
certainly
did
not
show
it
behind
his
mask
of
insolent
indifference
there
was
still
a
good
deal
of
muttered
abuse
being
directed
at
anazeh
the
atmosphere
was
electric
it
felt
as
if
violence
might
break
out
any
minute
abdul
ali
seemed
more
nervous
than
any
one
else
he
rocked
himself
gently
on
his
cushion
as
if
churning
the
milk
of
desire
into
the
butter
of
wise
words
suddenly
he
turned
to
the
sheikh
on
his
left
a
handsome
man
of
middle
age
who
wore
a
scimitar
tucked
into
a
sash
and
whispered
to
him
ben
hamza
whispered
to
me
that
sheikh
to
whom
abdul
ali
speaks
is
ali
shah
al
khassib
the
most
powerful
sheikh
in
these
parts
a
great
prince
a
man
with
many
followers
ali
shah
al
khassib
called
for
prayer
to
bring
the
mejlis
to
order
he
was
immensely
dignified
the
few
words
he
pronounced
about
asking
god
to
bless
the
assembled
notables
with
wisdom
in
order
that
they
might
reach
a
right
decision
would
have
been
perfectly
in
place
in
the
capitol
at
washington
or
anywhere
else
where
men
foregather
to
decide
on
peace
or
war
at
once
a
on
his
left
opened
a
copy
of
the
koran
on
a
cushion
on
his
lap
and
began
to
read
from
it
in
a
nasal
singsong
there
were
various
degrees
of
devoutness
and
even
of
inattention
shown
by
those
who
listened
some
knelt
and
prostrated
themselves
others
including
anazeh
sat
bolt
upright
closing
their
eyes
dreamily
at
intervals
over
the
way
jim
suliman
ben
saoud
grim
was
especially
formally
devout
his
very
life
undoubtedly
depended
on
being
recognized
as
a
fanatic
of
fanatics
moslem
priest
who
recites
prayers
but
there
were
three
christian
sheikhs
in
the
room
one
of
them
opposite
me
pulled
out
a
bible
and
laid
it
on
the
carpet
as
a
sort
of
challenge
to
the
koran
it
was
probably
a
dangerous
thing
to
do
although
most
moslems
respect
the
bible
as
a
very
sacred
book
the
manner
in
which
it
was
done
suggested
deliberate
effort
to
provoke
a
quarrel
mahommed
ben
hamza
dividing
his
time
like
a
schoolboy
in
chapel
between
staring
about
him
and
attending
by
fits
and
starts
nudged
me
in
the
ribs
and
whispered
see
that
christian
he
would
not
dare
do
that
only
on
this
occasion
they
like
to
think
that
moslems
and
christians
are
agreeing
together
the
man
who
was
reading
to
himself
from
the
bible
looked
up
and
caught
my
eye
he
tapped
the
book
with
his
finger
and
nodded
as
much
as
to
ask
why
i
did
not
join
him
at
once
i
pulled
my
own
from
my
pocket
he
smiled
acknowledgment
as
i
opened
it
at
random
certainly
he
thought
i
did
it
to
support
his
tactlessly
assertion
of
his
own
religion
very
likely
my
action
since
i
was
a
guest
and
therefore
not
to
be
insulted
saved
him
from
violence
incipient
snarls
of
fanatical
indignation
died
away
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
my
eye
was
on
jim
suliman
ben
saoud
grim
as
the
reading
from
the
koran
came
to
an
end
amid
a
murmur
of
responses
from
all
the
sheikhs
the
ichwan
sat
upright
in
his
sullen
indifferent
way
he
stared
leisurely
along
the
line
until
his
eyes
rested
on
me
as
his
eyes
met
mine
i
marked
the
place
where
the
bible
was
open
with
a
pencil
and
closed
the
book
suspecting
that
he
might
be
glad
to
know
where
a
pencil
could
be
found
in
a
contingency
he
did
not
smile
the
expression
of
his
face
barely
changed
just
for
a
second
i
thought
i
saw
a
flicker
of
amused
approval
pass
over
the
corners
of
his
eyes
and
mouth
so
i
left
the
book
lying
where
it
was
with
the
pencil
folded
in
it
chapter
eight
he
will
say
next
that
it
was
he
who
set
the
stars
in
the
sky
over
and
makes
the
moon
rise
ali
shah
al
khassib
was
the
first
to
speak
he
was
heard
to
the
end
respectfully
none
interrupting
but
it
seemed
obvious
from
their
faces
that
not
a
few
sheikhs
were
disposed
to
question
both
his
leadership
and
most
of
what
he
said
mahommed
ben
hamza
kept
up
a
running
whisper
of
interpretation
breathing
into
my
ear
until
it
was
wet
with
condensed
breath
i
had
to
use
a
handkerchief
repeatedly
ali
shah
al
khassib
made
no
definite
proposal
he
said
that
a
man
whom
they
all
knew
well
had
brought
news
to
the
effect
that
emir
feisul
was
ready
to
make
war
on
the
french
in
order
to
drive
them
out
of
syria
that
in
a
case
like
that
of
moslems
against
kafirs
there
could
be
no
question
on
which
side
their
hearts
or
their
interests
lay
that
several
dependable
men
had
brought
word
of
great
unrest
in
palestine
that
in
all
likelihood
the
british
would
send
their
army
to
help
the
french
in
which
case
the
arabs
of
palestine
were
likely
to
rise
in
rebellion
in
the
british
army
rear
that
was
the
situation
they
were
invited
to
consider
it
and
to
decide
what
action
if
any
seemed
called
for
he
sat
down
without
having
risked
his
leadership
by
any
statement
of
his
own
attitude
he
had
simply
reported
facts
that
he
believed
to
be
true
facts
that
many
of
the
notables
plainly
did
not
yet
believe
or
believed
only
in
part
there
followed
a
perfect
babel
of
argument
during
which
the
servants
passed
the
coffee
and
cakes
around
after
that
during
every
interval
between
speeches
there
was
more
coffee
and
more
cakes
wonderful
cakes
made
with
honey
and
almonds
immensely
filling
but
the
more
full
an
arab
gets
of
stodgy
food
the
more
his
tongue
wags
until
at
last
he
talks
himself
to
sleep
for
ten
minutes
men
were
shouting
their
opinions
to
one
another
to
and
fro
across
the
room
from
what
i
could
make
of
it
there
was
not
a
man
who
did
not
advocate
putting
the
whole
of
palestine
to
the
sword
forthwith
but
it
was
noticeable
that
when
their
turns
came
to
stand
up
and
address
the
mejlis
their
advocacy
was
considerably
toned
down
everybody
seemed
to
want
somebody
else
to
father
the
proposal
for
a
raid
although
every
man
pretended
to
be
anxious
to
take
part
in
one
old
anazeh
on
my
right
sat
in
grim
silence
quizzing
each
talker
in
turn
with
puckered
eyes
the
only
comment
he
made
was
a
sort
of
internal
rumbling
suggestive
of
the
preliminary
notice
of
an
earthquake
at
the
end
of
ten
minutes
sheikh
ali
shah
al
khassib
brought
proceedings
a
step
forward
by
calling
for
confirmation
of
the
news
of
unrest
in
palestine
man
after
man
got
up
and
since
he
was
speaking
of
others
not
of
himself
painted
the
discontent
of
the
palestinians
in
lurid
terms
each
man
tried
to
outvie
the
other
the
first
man
said
they
were
anxious
regarding
the
zionists
and
keen
for
a
solution
of
the
problem
the
second
said
they
hated
the
zionists
and
could
see
no
way
out
of
their
predicament
but
by
rebellion
the
third
said
that
no
arab
in
palestine
could
eat
for
thinking
of
the
zionist
outrage
and
that
the
heart
of
every
man
in
should
bleed
for
his
distressed
brethren
to
judge
by
what
the
fourth
and
fifth
and
sixth
said
palestine
was
in
a
state
of
scarcely
suppressed
rebellion
and
every
living
arab
in
the
country
was
sharpening
his
sword
in
secret
for
the
butchering
of
zionists
at
the
first
opportunity
the
seventh
man
said
that
the
palestine
arabs
had
never
under
turkish
rule
suffered
and
groaned
as
they
did
under
the
british
and
that
their
cry
was
going
up
to
heaven
for
relief
from
the
ignominious
tyranny
of
zionist
pretensions
ali
shah
al
khassib
chose
that
ringing
appeal
as
the
cue
for
his
next
move
in
the
game
he
called
on
sheikh
abdul
ali
as
well
known
in
damascus
as
in
this
place
to
address
the
mejlis
there
was
instant
silence
even
the
coffee
cups
ceased
rattling
abdul
ali
got
to
his
feet
with
the
manner
of
a
man
long
used
to
swaying
assemblies
he
had
just
the
right
air
of
authority
exactly
the
right
suggestion
of
deference
the
quiet
smile
of
the
man
with
secrets
up
his
sleeve
and
he
paused
just
long
enough
before
speaking
to
whet
curiosity
and
fix
attention
he
did
not
speak
floridly
or
fast
and
he
indulged
in
none
of
those
flights
of
oratory
that
most
arabs
love
there
was
ample
time
between
his
sentences
for
mahommed
ben
hamza
to
translate
into
my
wet
and
itching
ear
but
every
sentence
of
his
speech
had
measured
weight
in
it
and
every
word
he
used
was
chosen
for
its
poison
or
its
sting
he
began
by
reminding
them
of
the
war
and
of
emir
feisul
share
in
it
of
how
they
and
their
fathers
and
their
sons
had
fought
behind
feisul
and
helped
to
establish
him
in
damascus
then
he
spoke
of
the
british
promise
that
the
arabs
should
have
a
kingdom
of
their
own
with
damascus
for
its
capital
and
borders
to
include
all
the
peoples
of
arab
blood
in
the
near
east
he
paused
for
a
full
minute
after
that
then
but
the
french
are
in
syria
the
french
who
also
promised
us
an
arab
kingdom
they
have
assembled
at
the
coast
an
army
that
already
threatens
emir
feisul
the
british
are
in
palestine
where
they
are
admitting
a
horde
of
zionist
jews
to
displace
us
arabs
rightful
owners
of
the
soil
the
british
are
also
in
mesopotamia
which
they
have
seized
for
themselves
for
the
sake
of
the
oil
which
allah
in
his
wisdom
created
beneath
the
fertile
earth
feisul
makes
ready
to
defend
syria
against
the
french
but
the
british
will
march
to
the
aid
of
the
french
can
anybody
tell
me
how
much
of
that
promise
to
us
arabs
has
been
kept
by
either
nation
french
or
british
so
far
he
was
on
thoroughly
safe
ground
a
man
who
preached
against
the
french
could
hardly
be
suspected
of
being
hired
by
the
french
to
do
it
there
was
nobody
there
but
he
who
could
say
what
feisul
intentions
actually
were
you
can
say
what
you
like
against
the
british
anywhere
at
any
time
and
find
some
one
to
believe
what
you
say
and
it
needed
no
wizardry
to
prove
that
the
allies
had
broken
every
promise
they
ever
made
to
the
arabs
are
you
going
to
sit
idle
and
let
emir
feisul
and
the
syrians
fight
the
french
alone
he
asked
and
paused
again
there
was
a
great
deal
of
murmuring
not
quite
all
of
it
i
thought
entirely
in
his
favour
what
is
the
alternative
to
sitting
still
like
camels
waiting
to
be
doubly
burdened
if
you
raid
palestine
the
local
arabs
will
all
rise
to
your
assistance
the
throat
of
every
zionist
from
the
lebanon
to
beersheba
will
be
cut
there
will
be
plunder
beyond
reckoning
and
you
will
help
feisul
by
holding
back
the
british
army
from
marching
to
the
assistance
of
the
french
the
question
is
are
you
men
are
you
arabs
are
you
true
moslems
or
do
you
like
to
look
down
from
these
heights
of
over
the
home
of
your
ancestors
in
the
hands
of
zionists
who
are
nothing
but
jews
under
a
new
name
he
sat
down
before
any
one
could
answer
him
and
whispered
to
ali
shah
al
khassib
who
called
on
another
man
to
speak
at
once
it
was
a
pretty
obvious
piece
of
concerted
strategy
but
he
got
by
with
it
for
the
moment
the
general
feeling
seemed
to
be
in
favour
of
a
raid
if
only
some
one
would
start
it
nobody
seemed
to
mind
much
how
the
decision
was
arrived
at
so
long
as
the
responsibility
was
passed
to
some
one
else
the
man
now
called
on
was
a
tall
lean
individual
with
shifty
eyes
and
a
flow
of
talk
of
the
coffeeshop
variety
at
the
end
of
his
first
sentence
any
fool
would
have
known
that
he
had
been
put
up
to
quiz
abdul
ali
in
order
that
abdul
ali
might
have
an
excuse
to
justify
himself
he
attacked
him
very
mildly
with
much
careful
hedging
and
apologetic
gesture
on
the
ground
that
possibly
the
damascene
was
ignoring
their
interests
while
urging
them
to
take
action
that
would
suit
his
own
even
with
that
mild
criticism
he
set
loose
quite
a
murmur
of
minority
agreement
for
the
first
time
since
the
began
anazeh
barked
approval
i
thought
for
a
moment
the
old
man
was
going
to
get
to
his
feet
but
abdul
ali
was
up
again
first
and
launched
on
the
seas
of
if
i
had
not
listened
to
equally
childish
political
maneuvers
in
the
states
and
seen
them
succeed
for
the
reason
that
people
who
want
something
want
also
to
be
fooled
into
getting
it
by
special
arguments
it
would
have
seemed
incredible
that
a
man
who
had
recently
boasted
of
statesmanship
should
dare
to
make
such
a
public
ass
of
himself
yet
for
fifteen
minutes
he
carried
the
whole
meeting
with
him
and
the
warmth
of
his
emotion
made
him
ooze
resplendent
sweat
now
he
speaks
of
you
effendi
mahommed
ben
hamza
whispered
and
in
confirmation
of
it
anazeh
clutched
my
arm
as
if
to
keep
the
tide
of
eloquence
from
washing
me
away
had
the
british
done
anything
for
the
country
this
side
of
jordan
anything
for
the
people
education
for
instance
no
instead
they
had
taken
away
the
missionaries
better
than
nothing
were
those
missionaries
they
had
their
faults
they
undermined
religion
but
they
taught
and
the
british
had
called
them
in
giving
some
ridiculous
excuse
about
danger
it
had
remained
then
for
him
abdul
ali
of
damascus
and
of
the
same
individual
who
was
now
urging
them
to
strike
for
their
own
advantage
to
take
the
first
step
for
the
establishment
in
of
a
school
that
should
be
independent
of
the
british
he
abdul
ali
greatly
daring
because
he
had
the
interest
of
kerak
at
heart
had
introduced
that
day
into
the
mejlis
a
distinguished
guest
from
the
united
states
whose
sole
desire
whose
only
object
in
life
whose
altruistic
and
divine
ambition
was
to
establish
an
american
secular
school
in
he
sat
down
glowing
with
and
then
the
fur
flew
anazeh
was
first
on
his
feet
princes
he
shouted
that
damascene
is
a
father
of
lies
it
was
i
anazeh
who
brought
this
man
hither
that
corrupter
of
honesty
who
doles
out
other
people
gold
for
bidden
purposes
seeks
to
appear
as
your
benefactor
it
was
fairly
obvious
that
anazeh
had
not
received
any
of
the
gold
he
will
say
next
that
it
was
he
who
set
the
stars
in
the
sky
over
and
makes
the
moon
rise
he
is
a
foreigner
a
father
of
snakes
and
a
born
liar
anazeh
refused
to
sit
down
again
but
stood
with
rifle
on
his
arm
daring
any
one
to
challenge
his
statements
abdul
ali
flushed
angrily
but
laughed
aloud
the
next
man
on
his
feet
was
ben
nazir
my
erstwhile
host
who
had
repudiated
me
and
he
repudiated
me
all
over
again
accusing
me
of
abusing
his
hospitality
by
going
over
to
abdul
ali
who
had
never
even
heard
of
me
before
i
came
to
there
was
no
making
head
or
tail
of
the
storm
of
abuse
and
that
followed
except
that
it
did
not
look
healthy
for
me
there
seemed
to
be
four
or
five
different
factions
all
of
whom
regarded
me
as
the
bone
of
contention
rather
than
betray
anxiety
i
opened
the
bible
and
began
to
make
dots
under
letters
spelling
out
a
message
to
grim
to
the
effect
that
i
had
no
notion
where
to
find
lodgings
for
the
night
and
that
if
anazeh
elected
to
carry
me
off
i
should
have
to
go
with
him
i
did
not
know
how
to
get
the
message
to
him
without
arousing
suspicion
and
making
matters
worse
than
they
were
and
it
seemed
best
not
to
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
i
was
writing
so
i
made
a
few
dots
at
a
time
and
looked
about
me
i
saw
abdul
ali
laughing
cynically
make
a
gesture
with
his
arm
as
if
he
consigned
me
to
the
dogs
then
i
caught
grim
eye
suliman
ben
saoud
he
too
was
making
capital
of
my
predicament
he
had
got
the
attention
of
the
men
around
him
and
was
pointing
at
the
bible
while
he
reeled
off
a
string
of
an
angry
rhetoric
that
sounded
like
a
he
shouted
at
me
and
made
angry
gestures
but
i
knew
that
if
he
wanted
me
to
understand
his
signals
he
would
never
make
them
openly
so
i
ignored
them
the
sheikh
from
arabia
demands
to
see
the
book
said
mahommed
ben
hamza
in
my
ear
i
passed
it
over
the
carpet
with
the
pencil
folded
in
it
at
the
page
i
had
begun
to
mark
and
the
men
opposite
handed
it
along
with
remarks
they
considered
appropriate
jim
suliman
ben
saoud
grim
seized
the
book
angrily
glared
at
it
denounced
it
and
wrote
something
on
the
he
showed
it
to
the
men
beside
him
and
they
laughed
nodding
approval
he
wrote
again
they
approved
again
he
turned
and
talked
to
them
then
as
if
he
had
an
afterthought
he
wrote
a
third
time
when
they
wanted
to
look
at
that
he
ran
the
pencil
through
it
and
wrote
something
else
on
the
other
side
of
the
at
which
they
all
laughed
uproariously
presently
he
tossed
the
book
back
to
me
with
all
the
outward
signs
of
contempt
that
a
fanatic
can
show
for
another
religion
i
have
kept
that
bible
as
a
souvenir
with
the
verses
from
the
koran
written
on
the
flyleaf
in
arabic
in
grim
fine
hand
underneath
them
in
greek
characters
with
a
pencil
line
scrawled
through
them
is
the
only
sentence
that
interested
me
at
the
moment
this
looks
good
keep
anazeh
quiet
and
sober
anazeh
was
beginning
to
hold
forth
again
shaking
his
fist
at
abdul
ali
and
making
the
roof
echo
to
his
mighty
bellowing
i
tugged
at
the
skirt
of
his
cloak
and
after
a
minute
he
sat
down
to
discover
what
i
wanted
he
seemed
to
think
i
needed
reassurance
he
began
to
flood
me
with
promises
of
protection
it
was
about
a
minute
before
i
could
get
a
word
in
edgeways
then
jimgrim
says
said
i
jimgrim
is
he
here
he
surely
is
how
do
you
know
we
have
a
sign
jimgrim
says
quiet
and
drink
no
strong
drink
he
leaned
across
to
mahommed
ben
hamza
doubting
his
ears
and
my
arabic
i
repeated
the
message
and
ben
hamza
translated
i
do
believe
jimgrim
is
here
said
anazeh
i
would
know
him
among
a
million
it
is
true
said
ben
hamza
grinning
from
ear
to
ear
for
i
myself
know
where
he
sits
where
then
anazeh
demanded
excitedly
do
you
dare
said
i
and
ben
hamza
grinned
again
he
is
my
friend
i
say
nothing
he
answered
anazeh
put
in
the
next
five
minutes
minutely
examining
every
face
within
range
while
the
din
of
argument
rose
louder
and
more
violent
than
ever
and
suspicion
of
me
seemed
to
be
gaining
but
suddenly
suliman
ben
saoud
got
to
his
feet
and
there
was
silence
they
were
all
willing
to
listen
to
a
member
of
the
ichwan
sect
for
the
news
of
its
power
and
political
designs
had
spread
wherever
men
talk
arabic
he
spoke
gutturally
in
a
dialect
that
ben
hamza
did
not
find
it
any
too
easy
to
follow
so
i
only
got
the
general
gist
of
grim
remarks
he
said
that
he
had
much
experience
of
raids
and
of
making
preparations
for
them
a
raid
aimed
at
the
zionists
at
this
moment
might
be
good
perhaps
they
were
better
judges
of
that
than
he
but
it
was
to
know
who
was
in
favour
of
the
raid
and
exactly
why
the
words
men
spoke
were
not
nearly
so
impressive
as
the
deeds
they
did
therefore
when
the
illustrious
sheikh
abdul
ali
of
damascus
urged
a
raid
on
the
one
hand
and
boasted
of
provision
for
a
school
in
on
the
other
it
would
be
well
to
examine
this
foreign
effendi
whom
abdul
ali
claimed
to
have
introduced
the
claim
was
disputed
but
the
claim
was
not
made
for
nothing
in
his
judgment
based
on
vast
experience
of
politics
in
arabia
motives
were
seldom
on
the
surface
all
depended
on
the
motives
of
the
illustrious
abdul
ali
this
stranger
from
america
he
glared
balefully
at
me
should
be
investigated
thoroughly
as
a
man
of
vast
experience
with
the
interests
of
at
heart
he
offered
respectfully
to
examine
this
stranger
thoroughly
with
the
aid
of
an
interpreter
he
confessed
to
certain
suspicions
should
they
prove
unfounded
then
it
might
be
reasonable
to
credit
the
rest
of
abdul
ali
statements
if
not
no
he
was
willing
if
the
honourable
mejlis
saw
fit
to
take
the
stranger
aside
and
put
many
questions
to
him
when
he
had
finished
you
could
actually
physically
feel
the
suspicion
directed
at
me
it
was
like
a
cold
wind
anazeh
was
just
as
conscious
of
it
and
muttered
something
about
its
being
time
to
go
abdul
ali
got
up
and
asked
indignantly
why
the
ichwan
from
so
far
away
should
have
such
an
important
voice
he
himself
stood
there
ready
to
answer
all
questions
suliman
ben
saoud
retorted
sourly
that
he
proposed
to
question
the
damascene
in
public
after
privately
interrogating
me
they
shall
not
interfere
with
you
you
are
in
my
charge
anazeh
growled
in
my
ear
i
will
summon
my
men
at
the
first
excuse
jimgrim
says
quiet
i
answered
there
was
another
uproar
ali
shah
al
khassib
openly
took
the
part
of
abdul
ali
a
dozen
men
demanded
to
know
how
much
he
had
been
paid
to
do
it
finally
suliman
ben
saoud
beckoned
me
i
got
up
and
with
mahommed
ben
hamza
at
my
heels
i
followed
him
to
a
narrow
door
in
a
side
wall
that
opened
on
a
stone
stairway
leading
to
the
ramparts
anazeh
came
too
growling
like
a
hungry
bear
and
after
a
couple
of
threats
hurled
at
suliman
ben
saoud
back
he
took
up
position
in
the
open
door
facing
the
crowd
and
dared
any
one
to
try
to
follow
he
seemed
to
have
confidence
in
mahommed
ben
hamza
ability
to
protect
me
if
necessary
on
the
roof
the
roof
and
ramparts
appeared
deserted
they
were
in
the
ruinous
state
to
which
the
turks
reduce
everything
by
sheer
neglect
and
in
which
arabs
blaming
the
turks
seemed
quite
disposed
to
leave
things
the
ichwan
led
the
way
to
the
southwest
corner
peering
about
him
to
make
sure
no
guards
were
in
hiding
or
asleep
behind
projecting
buttresses
overhead
the
kites
were
wheeling
against
a
pure
blue
sky
the
dead
sea
lay
and
smiled
below
us
with
the
gorgeous
treeless
judean
hills
beyond
through
the
broken
window
of
the
hall
came
the
clamour
of
arguing
men
o
jimgrim
grinned
mahommed
ben
hamza
when
we
reached
the
corner
grim
turned
and
faced
us
with
folded
arms
leaning
his
back
against
the
parapet
ben
hamza
continued
you
are
a
very
prince
of
one
word
from
me
one
little
word
and
they
would
fling
you
down
into
the
moat
for
the
vultures
to
feed
on
i
remember
a
time
grim
answered
when
a
word
from
me
saved
you
from
hanging
true
father
of
good
fortune
but
a
man
must
laugh
i
will
hold
my
tongue
in
like
a
tomb
that
has
not
been
plundered
you
better
you
work
to
do
where
are
your
men
all
where
i
can
find
them
good
you
get
turned
out
of
the
mejlis
presently
look
down
into
the
moat
now
we
all
peered
over
the
lower
ramp
of
the
wall
sloped
steeply
but
all
the
way
up
the
sharp
southwest
corner
the
stones
were
broken
out
and
a
goat
or
a
very
active
man
could
find
foothold
could
you
climb
that
surely
remember
jimgrim
when
i
climbed
the
wall
of
jerusalem
to
escape
from
the
police
bring
your
men
into
the
moat
between
dark
and
moonrise
have
a
long
rope
with
you
a
good
one
you
and
two
men
climb
up
here
and
hide
the
remainder
wait
below
oh
yes
and
bring
a
wheat
sack
a
new
strong
one
you
may
have
to
wait
for
several
hours
when
you
see
me
take
your
cue
from
me
but
whatever
happens
no
murder
you
understand
nobody
to
be
killed
ben
hamza
grinned
and
nodded
he
seemed
to
be
one
of
those
natured
rogues
who
ask
nothing
better
than
the
sheer
sport
of
lawless
he
would
have
made
a
perfect
chief
of
staff
for
any
brigand
provided
the
brigand
took
lots
of
chances
you
be
killed
if
anybody
finds
you
up
here
after
dark
you
realize
that
trust
me
grim
nodded
he
was
good
at
trusting
people
when
he
had
to
and
when
the
selection
was
his
own
affairs
seem
to
be
drifting
nicely
he
said
turning
to
me
it
best
not
to
let
anazeh
know
who
i
am
just
yet
if
that
can
be
helped
but
if
you
must
when
the
time
comes
you
have
to
tell
him
do
keep
him
sober
after
the
evening
prayer
be
a
banquet
if
he
gets
drunk
we
done
for
i
going
to
make
you
out
an
awful
leper
if
you
do
mind
they
may
yell
for
your
hide
and
feathers
before
i
finished
but
anazeh
will
protect
you
if
he
leaves
the
hall
in
a
huff
do
make
any
bones
about
going
with
him
let
him
ride
out
of
town
and
wait
for
me
about
two
miles
down
the
track
at
the
point
where
that
tomb
stands
above
a
narrow
pass
between
two
big
rocks
do
you
remember
it
what
if
he
wo
wait
he
must
tell
him
i
have
a
prisoner
with
me
then
he
be
curious
but
you
can
bet
on
old
anazeh
when
he
sober
but
things
may
turn
out
so
that
it
simpler
for
you
to
stay
and
see
this
through
with
me
in
that
case
you
must
persuade
him
to
go
without
you
after
explaining
to
him
just
where
he
to
wait
how
shall
i
do
that
i
said
i
have
enough
arabic
i
write
it
he
answered
give
me
that
pencil
say
something
too
then
about
his
keeping
sober
grim
nodded
and
wrote
quite
a
long
letter
in
arabic
on
a
page
of
my
notebook
the
next
move
he
said
as
i
pocketed
the
letter
is
for
me
to
get
abdul
ali
goat
i
think
and
i
hope
he
try
to
bribe
me
if
he
does
he
my
meat
the
whole
question
of
raid
or
no
raid
hangs
on
their
confidence
in
him
if
i
throw
suspicion
on
him
and
he
disappears
directly
afterwards
they
abandon
the
plan
confiscate
his
goods
and
chattels
and
quarrel
among
themselves
instead
of
raiding
palestine
get
me
i
sat
on
a
horse
i
was
warned
against
felt
safer
and
gone
to
hospital
at
that
he
laughed
no
hospitals
up
here
it
be
soon
over
if
they
get
wise
to
us
but
i
think
we
all
right
and
you
almost
certainly
safe
but
do
be
tempted
to
talk
well
we
been
up
here
long
enough
for
me
to
have
put
you
through
the
third
degree
better
look
a
bit
uncomfortable
as
you
go
down
as
if
i
got
under
your
skin
with
some
awkward
questions
you
too
ben
hamza
do
grin
look
afraid
i
am
not
at
all
afraid
jimgrim
but
i
will
try
grim
studied
for
a
moment
do
forget
he
added
at
the
first
suggestion
that
not
wanted
make
yourself
scarce
and
go
and
round
up
your
men
if
you
thrown
out
pretty
roughly
keep
your
temper
and
run
taht
yours
to
command
come
on
then
let
go
the
sun
was
fairly
low
over
the
judean
hills
as
we
turned
down
the
narrow
stairs
and
found
anazeh
waiting
at
the
bottom
chapter
nine
feet
downwards
too
afraid
to
yell
abdul
ali
of
damascus
was
holding
the
floor
again
when
we
returned
he
had
abandoned
the
cold
air
of
mysterious
authority
and
secrets
in
reserve
his
claim
to
backstairs
influence
having
been
challenged
he
had
resorted
to
the
emotional
appeal
that
is
the
simplest
means
of
controlling
any
crowd
of
men
anywhere
the
demagog
who
can
find
a
million
men
all
responsive
to
the
same
emotion
can
swing
them
as
easily
as
a
hundred
if
he
knows
his
business
loot
was
the
tune
he
harped
with
the
old
ishmael
by
way
of
obbligato
he
had
them
by
the
and
there
were
bottles
of
liquor
that
smelt
of
aniseed
being
passed
from
hand
to
hand
we
returned
to
our
places
almost
unnoticed
and
within
the
minute
some
one
handed
a
full
bottle
to
anazeh
the
accompanying
cup
was
big
enough
to
hold
any
ordinary
drunkard
breakfast
and
the
old
sheikh
eyes
admired
the
size
of
it
i
laid
my
hand
on
the
wrist
that
held
the
bottle
he
shook
it
off
angrily
and
began
to
pour
grim
over
the
way
looked
anxious
it
was
up
to
me
to
play
this
hand
so
i
led
my
ace
of
trumps
suddenly
and
very
clumsily
i
rocked
sideways
to
reach
my
pocket
contriving
to
jog
his
elbow
and
spill
what
was
already
in
the
cup
he
turned
his
head
to
curse
savagely
and
i
showed
him
the
folded
sheet
from
my
notebook
his
name
was
on
it
in
arabic
sheikh
anazeh
ben
mahmoud
from
jimgrim
he
seized
it
setting
the
bottle
down
between
his
feet
where
it
was
instantly
reached
for
by
some
one
else
and
handed
down
the
line
reading
was
evidently
not
anazeh
favorite
amusement
but
he
knitted
his
brows
over
the
letter
and
wrestled
with
it
word
by
word
while
abdul
ali
fiery
declamation
made
the
vaulted
roof
resound
i
could
only
make
out
snatches
of
the
appeal
to
savagery
a
word
and
a
sentence
here
and
there
who
are
you
princes
men
with
swords
or
slaves
who
must
obey
raid
over
the
jordan
twenty
thousand
strong
what
are
jews
shall
jews
take
the
home
of
your
ancestors
who
says
so
let
the
jews
be
buried
in
the
land
they
come
to
steal
you
say
the
jews
are
cleverer
than
you
cut
their
heads
off
then
they
can
not
think
when
did
jimgrim
give
you
this
anazeh
demanded
folding
the
letter
and
stowing
it
in
his
bosom
that
is
the
message
that
i
told
you
would
come
later
if
you
waited
do
you
know
what
is
in
the
message
no
that
was
perfectly
true
i
had
talked
with
grim
but
had
not
read
what
he
had
written
he
wishes
me
to
go
and
wait
for
him
in
a
certain
place
why
not
do
it
rubbama
perhaps
followers
of
the
prophet
sons
of
warrior
kings
thundered
abdul
ali
will
you
do
nothing
to
help
feisul
a
lineal
descendant
of
the
prophet
you
have
helped
him
to
a
throne
now
strike
to
hold
him
there
jimgrim
says
i
may
go
away
and
leave
you
here
growled
anazeh
what
say
you
ala
khatrak
please
yourself
jimgrim
is
wise
he
is
the
father
of
wisdom
mashallah
i
will
consider
it
there
will
be
a
banquet
presently
and
loot
you
can
help
yourselves
shouted
abdul
ali
of
damascus
then
he
sat
down
amid
a
storm
of
applause
suliman
ben
saoud
jimgrim
was
on
his
feet
before
the
tumult
died
away
and
again
they
grew
perfectly
still
to
listen
to
him
if
an
arab
loves
anything
under
heaven
more
than
his
own
style
of
fighting
it
is
the
action
and
reaction
of
debate
i
could
not
understand
a
word
of
the
dialect
but
abdul
ali
retorts
were
plain
enough
and
from
the
way
that
grim
pointed
at
me
and
mahommed
ben
hamza
it
was
fairly
easy
to
follow
what
was
happening
he
denounced
me
as
possibly
dangerous
and
wondered
why
they
permitted
me
to
have
an
interpreter
who
could
whisper
to
me
everything
that
was
being
said
put
out
the
interpreter
sneered
abdul
ali
and
there
was
a
chorus
of
approval
mahommed
ben
hamza
got
up
and
hurried
for
the
door
while
the
hurrying
was
good
and
painless
to
himself
though
it
was
hardly
that
to
other
people
forcing
his
way
between
the
notables
he
kicked
more
than
one
of
them
pretty
badly
and
grinned
when
they
cursed
him
i
saw
abdul
ali
of
damascus
whisper
to
one
of
his
parasites
who
got
up
at
once
and
made
his
way
toward
the
door
too
the
fellow
is
from
hebron
abdul
ali
sneered
in
a
voice
loud
enough
for
all
to
hear
it
is
best
that
he
should
not
go
back
to
hebron
to
tell
tales
i
have
attended
to
it
my
blood
ran
cold
i
tried
to
catch
grim
eye
but
he
would
not
look
in
my
direction
i
wondered
whether
he
had
heard
abdul
ali
threat
it
seemed
to
me
that
if
mahommed
ben
hamza
were
either
murdered
or
imprisoned
grim
whole
chance
of
success
was
gone
the
danger
would
be
multiplied
tenfold
anazeh
seemed
the
only
remaining
hope
the
individual
who
followed
ben
hamza
had
not
reached
the
door
yet
how
about
your
men
i
asked
they
are
all
right
anazeh
eyes
pursued
the
liquor
bottle
why
not
go
and
see
i
suggested
they
are
good
men
i
know
them
if
there
is
trouble
they
will
come
and
tell
me
the
door
opened
softly
the
gorgeous
parasite
slipped
through
i
had
a
mental
vision
of
mahommed
ben
hamza
lying
downward
with
his
new
coat
stained
with
blood
there
was
nothing
for
it
it
seemed
but
the
magic
formula
to
move
anazeh
jimgrim
says
that
ben
hamza
gets
safely
away
dog
of
a
hebron
tanner
son
let
him
die
what
is
that
to
me
it
is
jimgrim
command
wallahi
haida
fasl
by
god
this
is
a
strange
affair
wait
here
old
anazeh
with
the
name
of
the
prophet
of
god
on
his
lips
cast
an
envious
glare
at
the
bottle
of
liquor
and
seized
action
by
the
forelock
there
was
nothing
to
excite
comment
in
his
getting
up
to
leave
the
room
a
dozen
men
had
done
that
and
come
in
again
he
strode
out
straight
down
the
middle
of
the
carpet
suliman
ben
saoud
jimgrim
went
on
talking
and
to
judge
by
abdul
ali
of
damascus
increasingly
restless
retorts
he
was
getting
that
gentleman
goat
as
promised
finally
abdul
ali
got
to
his
feet
and
said
that
if
the
ichwan
would
see
him
alone
he
would
show
him
certain
documents
that
would
satisfy
him
but
that
it
would
not
be
policy
to
produce
them
in
public
he
offered
to
send
for
the
documents
and
to
show
them
during
or
after
the
banquet
so
jimgrim
sat
down
and
there
was
a
good
deal
of
quiet
nudging
and
nodding
every
one
seemed
to
understand
that
the
ichwan
was
going
to
be
bribed
they
seemed
to
admire
his
ability
to
get
for
himself
a
share
of
the
funds
that
most
of
them
had
tapped
a
man
nearly
opposite
me
leaned
over
and
said
in
fairly
good
french
with
the
manner
of
a
doctor
assuring
his
patient
that
the
worst
is
yet
to
come
it
has
been
decided
that
you
are
to
be
detained
here
in
the
castle
until
there
is
no
danger
of
your
carrying
away
important
news
while
i
was
turning
that
over
in
my
mind
anazeh
came
back
grinning
something
outside
had
tickled
him
immensely
but
he
would
not
say
anything
he
sat
down
beside
me
and
chuckled
into
his
beard
and
when
his
neighbour
on
the
right
asked
what
had
amused
him
he
turned
the
question
into
a
bawdy
joke
did
ben
hamza
get
away
i
whispered
he
only
nodded
he
continued
chuckling
until
the
man
on
duty
by
the
door
announced
to
the
assembled
lords
and
princes
that
the
muezzin
summoned
them
to
prayer
all
except
three
christian
sheikhs
trooped
up
the
narrow
stairway
in
ali
shah
al
wake
anazeh
going
last
with
a
joke
about
not
caring
to
be
stabbed
in
the
back
i
expected
the
three
would
take
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
ask
me
a
string
of
questions
but
they
took
exactly
the
opposite
view
of
the
situation
they
avoided
me
withdrawing
into
a
corner
by
themselves
i
suppose
they
thought
that
to
be
seen
talking
to
me
was
more
risky
than
the
amusement
merited
so
i
went
up
to
the
ramparts
too
to
watch
the
folk
at
prayer
minded
to
keep
out
of
sight
for
they
do
like
being
regarded
as
a
curious
spectacle
and
on
the
way
up
i
did
something
that
may
have
had
a
lot
to
do
with
our
getting
away
alive
although
i
did
not
give
much
thought
to
it
and
could
hardly
have
explained
my
motive
at
the
time
the
door
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
opened
inward
it
was
almost
exactly
the
same
width
as
the
stairway
so
that
when
it
stood
wide
open
you
could
not
have
put
your
hand
between
its
edge
and
the
stairway
wall
lying
on
the
floor
of
the
hall
within
a
few
feet
of
the
nearest
corner
was
a
length
of
good
sound
about
three
inches
in
thickness
roughly
squared
and
not
particularly
squared
having
stepped
on
it
accidentally
i
picked
it
up
and
discovered
more
by
accident
than
intention
that
it
was
longer
than
the
width
of
the
stairway
then
i
noticed
a
notch
in
the
stairway
wall
behind
the
opened
door
there
was
a
deeper
notch
in
the
opposite
wall
there
was
no
lock
on
the
door
no
bolt
that
length
of
wood
had
been
cut
to
fit
horizontally
from
notch
to
notch
across
the
passage
once
that
beam
was
fitted
in
its
place
whoever
wished
to
reach
the
roof
would
have
to
burn
or
batter
down
the
door
i
moved
the
door
and
placed
the
length
of
on
end
behind
it
i
found
the
view
from
the
ramparts
much
more
interesting
than
the
formalities
of
eighty
or
so
potential
while
they
prayed
i
stood
watching
the
shadows
deepen
in
the
jordan
valley
as
no
doubt
joshua
once
watched
them
from
somewhere
near
that
same
spot
before
he
marshalled
his
invading
host
you
could
understand
why
people
who
had
wandered
forty
years
in
a
stark
and
howling
wilderness
should
yearn
for
those
coloured
fertile
acres
between
the
jordan
and
the
sea
why
they
should
be
willing
to
fight
for
them
die
for
them
do
anything
rather
than
turn
back
by
the
time
we
had
filed
down
anazeh
last
again
the
servants
had
nearly
finished
spreading
a
banquet
what
looked
like
sheets
had
been
laid
along
the
strip
of
carpet
and
the
whole
length
of
them
was
piled
with
all
imaginable
things
to
eat
from
cakes
and
fruit
to
whole
sheep
roasted
and
seethed
in
milk
and
honey
there
were
no
less
than
six
sheep
placed
at
intervals
along
the
table
with
mountains
of
rice
of
apricots
cooked
in
various
ways
and
a
good
sized
flock
of
chickens
spitted
and
smeared
with
peppery
sauce
at
a
guess
i
should
say
there
were
several
pounds
of
meat
about
two
chickens
and
a
peck
of
rice
per
man
with
apricots
and
raisins
added
but
they
faced
the
prospect
like
heroes
perhaps
what
helped
them
face
it
was
the
sight
of
sundry
bottles
bearing
labels
more
familiar
in
the
west
abdul
ali
of
damascus
licking
his
lips
like
a
cat
that
smells
canary
took
his
place
on
a
cushion
up
near
the
window
again
on
the
right
of
ali
shah
al
khassib
who
was
only
the
nominal
host
abdul
ali
left
no
doubt
in
anybody
mind
as
to
who
was
paying
for
the
feast
it
was
he
who
gave
orders
to
the
servants
in
a
bullying
tone
of
voice
he
who
begged
every
one
be
seated
anazeh
looked
at
the
bottles
of
brandy
looked
at
me
and
prayed
under
his
breath
or
at
any
rate
it
looked
and
sounded
like
a
prayer
he
may
have
been
swearing
he
and
i
were
not
very
far
from
the
door
the
seats
near
the
head
of
the
table
had
all
been
taken
i
sat
down
at
once
so
as
not
to
be
conspicuous
but
anazeh
remained
standing
so
long
that
at
last
abdul
ali
called
to
him
to
sit
down
and
eat
his
fill
using
the
offensively
magnanimous
tone
of
voice
that
some
men
can
achieve
without
an
effort
i
think
anazeh
had
been
waiting
for
just
that
opening
i
have
twenty
men
outside
he
announced
shall
i
eat
and
not
they
this
is
a
feast
for
notables
said
abdul
ali
a
little
bread
with
my
own
men
is
better
than
meat
and
drink
at
a
traitor
table
anazeh
answered
wallahi
by
god
i
go
to
eat
with
honest
men
he
laid
a
hand
on
my
head
ye
have
said
this
effendi
must
stay
in
the
castle
well
and
good
whoever
harms
him
or
offers
him
indignity
shall
answer
to
me
and
my
men
for
it
he
bowed
to
me
like
a
king
taking
leave
of
his
court
lailtak
allah
yifazak
effendi
good
night
god
keep
you
effendi
with
that
he
stalked
out
and
the
door
slammed
shut
behind
him
everybody
including
abdul
ali
laughed
the
banquet
was
a
boresome
business
an
interminable
competition
to
see
who
could
eat
and
drink
the
most
with
my
interpreter
gone
and
everybody
else
too
busy
guzzling
to
trouble
to
speak
distinctly
for
my
benefit
i
had
to
depend
on
my
ayes
for
information
and
naturally
used
them
to
the
utmost
i
noticed
that
abdul
all
of
damascus
jimgrim
suliman
ben
saoud
and
myself
were
the
only
men
in
the
room
servants
included
who
ate
and
drank
within
the
bounds
of
decency
and
reason
one
of
the
servants
walking
up
and
down
the
with
brandy
and
relays
of
vegetables
was
drunk
very
early
in
the
game
and
had
to
be
thrown
out
abdul
ali
kept
conversation
going
on
the
subject
of
the
raid
the
more
the
brandy
bottles
circulated
the
easier
he
found
it
to
keep
enthusiasm
burning
he
talked
about
me
too
several
times
and
every
time
that
subject
cropped
up
all
eyes
turned
in
my
direction
i
think
he
was
making
the
most
of
the
school
idea
mixing
up
the
raid
with
education
and
serving
the
mixture
hot
as
it
were
with
brandy
sauce
but
over
the
way
about
down
the
table
the
ichwan
suliman
ben
saoud
and
abstemious
as
befitted
a
fanatic
was
talking
too
he
was
quite
evidently
talking
against
abdul
ali
so
that
the
damascene
kept
looking
at
him
with
a
troubled
expression
he
glanced
frequently
at
the
door
too
as
if
he
expected
some
one
who
could
put
an
end
to
suliman
ben
saoud
intrigue
but
it
was
a
long
time
before
the
door
opened
and
the
second
of
his
parasites
came
in
i
had
not
noticed
until
then
that
the
man
was
missing
he
thrust
a
packet
of
some
sort
into
abdul
ali
hands
he
whispered
the
damascene
face
darkened
instantly
and
he
swore
like
a
pirate
then
i
suppose
because
he
had
to
vent
his
wrath
on
somebody
he
shouted
to
me
in
german
all
down
the
length
of
the
table
your
cursed
interpreter
has
nearly
killed
my
secretary
he
struck
him
in
the
mouth
and
knocked
all
his
teeth
out
what
courteous
servants
you
employ
what
was
your
secretary
trying
to
do
to
him
i
retorted
but
he
saw
fit
not
to
answer
that
he
poured
some
more
brandy
instead
for
ali
shah
al
khassib
so
that
was
what
anazeh
had
been
laughing
at
the
old
humourist
had
either
seen
the
fracas
or
had
come
on
the
injured
messenger
of
death
nursing
a
damaged
face
i
began
to
share
grim
good
opinion
of
ben
hamza
but
though
i
watched
face
and
knew
that
he
knew
german
i
could
not
detect
a
trace
of
interest
he
kept
on
talking
against
abdul
ali
until
after
ten
by
that
time
most
of
the
notables
were
about
as
full
as
they
could
hold
those
who
were
not
too
drunk
appeared
ready
for
anything
in
or
out
of
reason
at
that
stage
of
the
proceedings
they
ushered
in
the
dancing
girls
the
servants
cleared
away
most
of
the
food
removed
the
and
a
ring
was
formed
practically
all
around
the
room
the
notables
leaning
their
backs
against
the
wall
to
ease
overworked
bellies
i
set
my
cushion
down
next
to
a
very
drunken
man
just
by
the
narrow
door
that
opened
on
the
stairway
leading
to
the
ramparts
he
fell
asleep
with
his
head
on
my
shoulder
within
five
minutes
and
as
that
for
some
subtle
reason
seemed
to
make
me
even
more
unnoticeable
i
let
him
snore
away
in
peace
over
in
abdul
ali
corner
of
the
room
there
was
a
real
council
of
war
going
on
in
whispers
opposite
to
him
ten
paces
or
so
distant
from
me
jimgrim
suliman
ben
saoud
was
holding
a
rival
show
it
seemed
about
an
even
bet
which
was
making
greater
headway
those
who
were
more
or
less
drunk
and
all
the
younger
sheikhs
had
eyes
and
ears
for
nothing
but
the
dancing
girls
they
were
outrageous
hussies
they
wore
more
clothes
than
a
broadway
chorus
lady
and
rather
less
paint
but
if
they
were
symbols
of
the
moslem
paradise
as
a
learned
arab
once
assured
me
that
they
are
meant
to
be
then
as
i
answered
the
arab
on
that
occasion
me
for
hell
but
none
of
those
sheikhs
had
ever
seen
broadway
so
you
could
hardly
blame
them
abdul
ali
of
damascus
seemed
to
have
his
arrangements
with
the
men
in
his
corner
cinched
at
last
to
his
satisfaction
he
walked
a
little
unsteadily
across
the
room
apparently
to
make
his
peace
with
suliman
ben
saoud
he
held
brazenly
in
one
hand
a
leather
wallet
that
bulged
with
paper
money
doubtless
the
documents
that
he
had
sent
for
he
nodded
to
me
as
he
passed
with
more
familiarity
than
he
had
any
right
to
since
he
had
so
ostentatiously
dismissed
me
to
the
dogs
i
suppose
he
felt
so
sure
of
convincing
suliman
ben
saoud
and
was
so
bent
on
offsetting
the
reaction
caused
by
anazeh
behavior
that
he
had
been
reviving
that
project
about
the
school
and
therefore
chose
to
appear
on
intimate
terms
with
me
i
met
him
more
than
any
one
who
cared
to
might
believe
i
loved
him
like
a
brother
he
stood
in
front
of
suliman
ben
saoud
rocking
just
a
trifle
from
the
effects
of
alcohol
and
smoke
and
there
was
about
five
minutes
conversation
of
which
although
i
missed
a
lot
of
it
i
caught
the
general
drift
the
men
who
had
come
under
the
ichwan
influence
kept
joining
in
and
raising
objections
i
gathered
that
they
expected
a
proportionate
percentage
of
the
bribe
for
which
suliman
ben
saoud
was
supposed
to
be
maneuvering
but
even
abdul
ali
with
a
pouch
of
paper
money
in
his
hand
was
not
quite
so
barefaced
as
to
bribe
the
ichwan
publicly
at
the
end
of
five
minutes
he
suggested
a
private
talk
on
the
parapet
suliman
ben
saoud
rose
with
apparent
reluctance
abdul
ali
of
damascus
took
his
arm
it
was
suliman
ben
saoud
who
opened
the
narrow
door
and
abdul
ali
who
went
through
first
i
did
not
wait
for
any
invitation
but
let
my
snoring
neighbor
fall
on
his
side
hurried
through
after
them
and
closed
the
door
behind
me
groping
for
the
stick
in
the
dark
i
jammed
it
into
the
notches
it
fitted
perfectly
it
held
the
door
immovable
and
barred
that
stairway
against
then
i
followed
them
to
the
parapet
the
moon
was
about
full
and
bathing
the
whole
roof
and
all
the
countryside
in
liquid
light
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
mist
lower
down
and
you
could
only
make
out
the
dead
sea
through
it
here
and
there
but
up
where
we
were
and
even
in
the
moat
eighty
feet
below
us
it
was
almost
like
daylight
without
the
glare
and
heat
i
leaned
over
but
could
see
nobody
in
the
moat
and
there
was
no
sign
of
mahommed
ben
hamza
abdul
ali
led
the
way
toward
the
corner
where
grim
had
given
his
orders
to
ben
hamza
that
afternoon
abdul
ali
did
not
seem
to
realize
that
i
was
following
when
he
turned
at
last
with
his
back
to
the
parapet
and
the
moonlight
full
in
his
face
he
demanded
in
german
wass
machen
sie
hier
i
was
about
to
answer
him
when
there
came
a
noise
like
subterranean
thunder
from
the
mouth
of
the
stairway
they
were
trying
to
force
that
door
below
and
follow
us
the
first
words
i
used
were
in
english
for
grim
benefit
i
stuck
a
stick
in
the
door
i
should
say
it
good
for
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
unless
they
use
explosives
that
gave
the
whole
game
away
at
once
so
said
abdul
ali
he
thrust
the
wallet
into
his
bosom
with
the
other
hand
he
pulled
out
a
repeating
pistol
so
grim
said
never
a
word
he
closed
with
him
in
a
second
we
were
all
three
struggling
like
madmen
the
pistol
was
not
cocked
i
managed
to
get
hold
of
abdul
ali
wrist
and
wrench
the
weapon
away
before
he
could
pull
back
the
slide
then
we
all
three
went
down
together
on
the
stone
roof
abdul
ali
yelling
like
a
maniac
and
grim
trying
to
squeeze
the
wind
out
of
him
even
then
as
we
rolled
and
fought
i
could
still
hear
the
thundering
on
the
door
no
doubt
the
noise
they
made
prevented
them
from
hearing
abdul
ali
yells
for
help
the
man
strength
was
prodigious
although
he
was
puffy
and
it
began
to
look
as
if
we
would
have
to
knock
him
on
the
head
to
get
control
of
him
but
even
so
there
was
no
rope
no
sign
of
mahommed
ben
hamza
and
his
men
you
can
think
of
a
lot
of
things
while
you
fight
for
your
life
eighty
miles
away
from
help
i
wondered
whether
grim
would
throw
him
over
the
parapet
and
whether
we
two
would
have
to
take
our
chance
of
mountaineering
down
that
ragged
corner
of
the
wall
but
suddenly
about
a
hundred
and
eighty
pounds
of
human
brawn
landed
on
my
back
a
voice
said
taib
jimgrim
and
two
other
men
jumped
after
him
from
somewhere
on
the
ruined
wall
above
us
in
another
second
abdul
ali
was
held
hand
and
foot
tied
until
he
could
not
move
and
then
a
was
pulled
down
over
his
head
and
made
fast
between
his
legs
right
you
late
said
grim
quick
where
the
rope
are
your
men
below
the
thundering
on
the
door
had
ceased
either
they
were
coming
up
the
steps
already
or
had
gone
to
reach
the
parapet
some
other
way
it
did
not
occur
to
me
or
for
that
matter
to
any
of
us
in
the
excitement
of
the
minute
that
they
might
be
holding
a
consultation
below
or
might
even
have
abandoned
the
idea
of
following
although
i
think
now
that
must
be
the
explanation
for
what
we
did
took
more
time
than
it
takes
to
set
it
down
ben
hamza
made
one
end
of
the
rope
fast
around
abdul
ali
feet
he
would
not
listen
to
argument
he
said
he
knew
his
business
and
certainly
the
knot
was
workmanlike
then
he
called
over
the
parapet
an
arab
never
whistles
and
a
voice
answered
from
the
southern
side
of
the
moat
where
some
fallen
stones
cast
a
shadow
then
the
three
of
them
lifted
abdul
ali
over
and
lowered
him
it
was
a
slow
business
for
otherwise
he
would
have
been
stunned
against
the
first
projection
i
thought
that
grim
looked
almost
as
nervous
as
i
felt
but
mahommed
ben
hamza
was
having
the
time
of
his
life
and
could
not
keep
his
tongue
still
head
upwards
a
man
can
yell
he
explained
to
me
grinning
from
ear
to
ear
feet
upwards
too
afraid
to
yell
then
the
thundering
on
the
door
began
again
louder
than
before
it
seemed
to
me
they
were
using
a
but
they
were
too
late
after
what
seemed
like
a
hour
we
saw
shadowy
arms
below
reach
up
and
seize
our
prisoner
then
the
loose
rope
came
up
again
hand
over
hand
you
next
said
grim
quietly
he
pushed
me
forward
after
carefully
examining
the
loop
mahommed
ben
hamza
tied
in
the
end
of
the
rope
chapter
ten
money
does
weigh
much
well
you
do
stand
on
precedence
or
ceremony
at
times
like
that
over
i
went
in
the
bight
of
the
rope
they
let
me
fall
about
fifteen
feet
before
they
seemed
to
realize
that
i
had
let
go
of
the
parapet
added
to
all
that
had
gone
before
that
made
about
the
climax
of
sensation
the
pain
of
barking
the
skin
of
knees
and
elbows
against
projecting
angles
of
stone
was
a
relief
i
am
no
man
of
iron
i
have
iron
nerves
not
one
second
of
that
descent
was
less
than
hell
i
could
hear
the
thunder
of
some
kind
of
on
the
door
at
the
foot
of
the
stair
i
could
imagine
the
rope
chafing
against
the
sharp
edge
of
the
parapet
as
they
paid
it
out
hand
over
hand
the
only
thing
that
made
me
keep
my
head
at
all
was
knowledge
that
abdul
ali
had
had
to
do
the
trip
with
his
head
in
a
bag
when
they
let
go
too
fast
it
was
rather
like
the
stage
of
taking
chloroform
when
they
slowed
up
there
was
the
agonizing
dread
of
pursuit
and
through
it
all
there
burned
the
torturing
suggestion
that
the
rope
might
break
mother
earth
felt
good
that
night
when
strong
hands
reached
up
and
lifted
me
out
of
the
noose
that
failed
of
reaching
the
bottom
by
about
a
man
height
come
to
think
of
it
it
was
mother
earth
at
that
it
was
the
stinking
carcass
of
a
camel
only
half
autopsied
by
the
vultures
that
my
feet
first
rested
on
brother
perhaps
to
the
beast
i
had
put
out
of
his
agony
that
afternoon
the
others
came
down
the
rope
grim
last
i
suppose
he
stayed
up
there
with
his
pistol
ready
for
contingencies
he
had
his
nerve
with
him
for
he
had
fastened
the
upper
end
of
the
rope
to
a
piece
of
broken
stone
laid
across
a
gap
that
the
crusaders
had
made
in
the
ramparts
centuries
ago
for
the
christian
purpose
of
pouring
boiling
oil
and
water
on
their
foes
it
did
not
take
more
than
a
minute
violent
shaking
after
he
got
down
to
bring
the
rope
tumbling
on
our
heads
then
the
next
thing
he
did
was
to
take
a
look
at
the
prisoner
finding
him
not
much
the
worse
for
wear
barring
some
bruises
and
a
missing
inch
or
two
of
skin
he
ordered
the
bag
pulled
over
his
head
again
and
gave
the
order
for
retreat
mahommed
ben
hamza
went
scouting
ahead
the
others
picked
up
abdul
ali
as
the
construction
gangs
handle
baulks
of
timber
horizontal
downward
when
he
wriggled
they
cuffed
him
into
good
behaviour
you
have
to
get
down
into
an
arab
moat
before
you
can
realize
what
the
hebrews
meant
by
their
word
gehenna
the
smell
of
rotting
carrion
was
only
part
of
it
one
stumbled
into
and
through
and
over
things
that
should
not
be
heaps
that
looked
solid
in
the
moonlight
yielded
to
the
tread
whatever
liquid
lay
there
was
the
product
of
corruption
yet
we
did
not
dare
to
climb
out
of
the
moat
until
we
reached
the
shadows
at
the
northern
angle
though
the
moonlight
shone
almost
straight
down
on
us
it
was
a
great
deal
brighter
up
above
and
the
walls
cast
some
shadow
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
pick
our
way
in
the
comparative
gloom
of
that
vulture
paradise
praying
we
might
find
a
stream
to
wade
in
presently
once
looking
up
behind
me
i
thought
i
saw
men
heads
peering
over
the
parapet
but
that
may
have
been
imagination
grim
vowed
he
did
not
see
them
although
i
suspected
him
of
saying
that
to
avoid
a
panic
he
shepherded
us
along
speaking
in
a
perfectly
normal
voice
whenever
he
had
to
as
if
there
were
no
such
thing
as
hurry
in
the
world
when
we
reached
the
farther
corner
of
the
moat
it
was
he
who
climbed
out
first
to
con
the
situation
a
in
a
bastion
on
the
ruined
town
wall
promptly
fired
at
him
i
expected
him
to
fire
back
i
climbed
up
beside
him
to
lend
a
hand
with
the
pistol
i
had
filched
from
abdul
ali
but
grim
shouted
something
about
taking
away
for
burial
the
corpse
of
a
man
who
had
died
of
the
man
on
the
wall
commanded
us
to
allah
mercy
and
warned
us
to
beware
lest
we
too
catch
that
dreaded
plague
inshallah
grim
answered
then
he
summoned
our
men
from
the
moat
they
passed
up
abdul
ali
dragging
him
again
with
one
man
keeping
a
clenched
fist
ready
to
strike
him
in
the
mouth
in
case
he
should
forget
that
corpses
do
cry
out
he
looked
like
a
corpse
as
they
carried
him
jerkily
along
a
track
that
roughly
followed
the
line
of
the
wall
i
do
suppose
that
anything
ever
looked
more
like
an
arab
funeral
procession
than
we
did
the
absence
of
noisy
mourners
and
the
unusual
hour
of
night
were
plausibly
accounted
for
by
the
dreaded
disease
that
grim
had
invented
for
the
occasion
my
was
the
only
false
note
but
i
kept
in
shadow
as
much
as
i
could
with
the
unseemly
burden
between
me
and
the
ramparts
it
was
a
long
time
before
we
had
the
town
wall
at
our
backs
a
funeral
in
the
circumstances
might
justifiably
be
rapid
but
we
could
hardly
run
and
keep
up
the
pretense
but
at
last
we
passed
over
the
shoulder
of
a
hill
into
shadow
on
the
farther
side
and
there
was
no
more
need
of
yalla
bilagel
run
like
the
devil
grim
ordered
then
and
we
obeyed
him
like
sprinters
attempting
to
lower
a
record
twelve
men
running
through
the
night
can
make
a
lot
of
noise
especially
when
they
carry
a
heavy
man
between
them
our
men
were
all
from
hebron
hebron
prides
itself
on
training
the
artfullest
thieves
in
asia
they
boast
of
being
able
to
steal
the
bed
from
under
a
sleeper
without
waking
him
but
even
the
stealthiest
animals
go
crashing
away
from
danger
and
now
that
the
worst
of
the
danger
lay
behind
more
or
less
panic
seized
all
of
us
mahommed
ben
hamza
refused
to
follow
the
regular
track
for
fear
of
ambush
or
a
chance
encounter
in
the
dark
grim
let
him
have
his
way
they
dragged
the
wretched
abdul
ali
like
a
sack
of
corn
by
a
winding
detour
and
wherever
the
narrow
path
turned
sharply
to
avoid
great
rocks
they
skidded
him
at
the
turn
until
he
yelled
for
mercy
grim
pulled
off
the
sack
at
last
untied
his
arms
and
legs
and
let
him
walk
but
whenever
he
lagged
they
him
again
at
last
we
reached
a
brook
where
we
all
waded
to
get
rid
of
the
filth
and
smell
from
that
infernal
moat
and
abdul
ali
seized
that
opportunity
to
play
his
last
cards
considering
ben
reputation
the
obvious
type
of
his
nine
ruffians
the
darkness
and
rough
handling
it
said
a
lot
for
grim
authority
that
abdul
ali
still
had
that
of
money
in
his
possession
sitting
on
a
stone
in
the
moonlight
he
pulled
it
out
his
nerve
was
a
politician
cynical
simple
its
simplicity
almost
took
your
breath
away
how
many
men
from
hebron
he
demanded
ten
well
and
good
i
have
here
ten
thousand
piastres
one
thousand
for
each
of
you
or
divide
it
how
you
like
that
is
the
price
i
will
pay
you
to
let
me
go
what
can
these
other
two
do
to
you
take
the
money
and
run
leave
me
to
settle
with
these
others
ben
hamza
in
the
brook
laughed
aloud
as
he
eyed
the
money
he
made
a
gesture
so
so
full
of
resignation
and
regret
and
broad
philosophy
that
you
would
have
liked
the
fellow
even
if
he
had
saved
your
life
deal
with
those
two
first
he
grinned
i
would
have
taken
your
money
long
ago
but
that
i
know
jimgrim
he
would
have
made
me
give
it
up
again
jimgrim
said
abdul
ali
jimgrim
are
you
major
james
grim
a
good
thing
for
you
i
did
not
know
that
when
i
had
you
in
my
power
in
the
castle
grim
laughed
are
we
all
set
let
go
we
hurried
all
the
faster
now
because
our
legs
were
wet
the
night
air
on
those
moab
heights
is
chilly
at
any
season
perhaps
too
we
were
trying
to
leave
behind
us
the
that
the
water
had
merely
reduced
not
washed
away
a
quarter
of
a
mile
before
we
reached
the
place
appointed
we
knew
that
anazeh
had
not
failed
to
keep
his
tryst
away
up
above
us
beside
the
tomb
like
an
ancient
bearded
ghost
anazeh
stood
motionless
silent
conning
the
track
we
should
come
by
a
grand
old
savage
keeping
faith
against
his
neighbours
for
the
sake
of
friendship
he
did
not
challenge
when
he
heard
us
he
took
aim
he
held
his
aim
until
grim
called
to
him
when
our
goat
track
joined
the
main
road
he
was
there
awaiting
us
standing
like
a
sentinel
in
the
shadow
of
a
fanged
rock
and
there
if
abdul
ali
of
damascus
could
have
had
his
way
there
would
have
been
a
fresh
debate
he
did
not
let
ten
seconds
pass
before
he
had
offered
anazeh
all
the
money
he
had
with
him
to
lend
him
a
horse
and
let
him
go
anazeh
waived
aside
the
offer
you
shall
have
as
much
more
money
as
you
wish
the
damascene
insisted
let
me
get
to
my
house
and
a
messenger
shall
take
the
money
to
you
or
come
and
get
it
all
the
answer
anazeh
gave
him
was
a
curt
laugh
one
bark
like
a
fox
where
are
all
the
horses
grim
demanded
i
could
only
see
five
of
six
i
wait
for
them
man
we
ca
wait
jimgrim
said
the
old
sheikh
with
a
glint
of
something
between
malice
and
amusement
in
his
eyes
i
knew
you
in
the
mejlis
when
you
watched
me
read
that
letter
one
word
from
me
and
he
made
a
click
between
his
teeth
suggestive
of
swift
death
i
let
you
play
your
game
but
now
i
play
my
game
allah
willing
i
have
waited
for
you
wait
thou
for
me
why
what
is
it
anazeh
beckoned
us
and
turned
away
we
followed
him
grim
and
i
across
the
road
and
up
a
steep
track
to
the
tomb
on
the
overhanging
rock
where
he
had
stood
when
we
first
saw
him
he
pointed
a
fire
with
golden
sparks
and
bellied
sulphur
smoke
was
blazing
in
the
midst
of
the
home
of
abdul
ali
of
damascus
said
anazeh
with
pride
in
his
voice
it
was
the
pride
of
a
man
who
shows
off
the
behaviour
of
his
children
my
men
did
it
how
can
they
escape
grim
asked
him
wallah
will
the
gate
guards
stand
idle
will
they
not
run
to
the
fire
and
to
the
looting
but
they
will
find
not
much
loot
my
men
already
have
it
loot
said
grim
will
delay
them
money
does
weigh
much
anazeh
answered
here
my
men
come
somebody
was
coming
there
came
a
burst
of
shooting
and
yelling
from
somewhere
between
us
and
and
a
moment
later
the
thunder
of
horses
galloping
anazeh
got
down
to
the
road
with
the
agility
of
a
youngster
ordered
abdul
ali
of
damascus
the
shivering
ahmed
and
me
under
cover
he
placed
his
remaining
handful
of
men
at
points
of
vantage
where
they
could
cover
the
retreat
of
the
fifteen
and
it
was
well
he
did
there
were
at
least
two
score
in
hot
pursuit
and
though
you
could
hardly
tell
which
was
which
in
that
dim
light
party
opened
fire
on
the
pursuers
and
let
the
fifteen
through
i
did
not
get
sight
of
grim
while
that
excitement
lasted
but
he
had
two
automatics
he
took
from
me
the
one
that
i
had
taken
from
abdul
ali
and
with
that
one
and
his
own
he
made
a
din
like
a
he
told
me
afterward
that
he
had
fired
in
the
air
noise
is
as
good
as
in
the
dark
he
explained
while
anazeh
men
boasted
to
one
another
of
the
straight
shooting
that
it
may
be
they
really
believed
they
had
done
an
arab
can
believe
anything
afterward
i
do
believe
one
man
was
killed
though
several
were
hit
at
any
rate
whether
the
noise
accomplished
it
or
not
the
pursuers
drew
off
and
we
went
forward
carrying
a
cashbox
now
of
which
abdul
ali
was
politely
requested
to
produce
the
key
that
was
the
first
intimation
he
had
that
his
house
had
been
looted
he
threw
his
bunch
of
keys
away
into
the
shadows
in
the
first
exhibition
of
real
weakness
he
had
shown
that
night
it
was
a
silly
gesture
it
only
angered
his
captors
it
saved
him
nothing
four
more
of
anazeh
men
had
been
wounded
all
from
behind
two
of
them
rather
badly
making
six
in
all
who
were
now
unfit
for
further
action
but
we
did
not
wait
to
bandage
them
they
affected
to
make
light
of
their
injuries
saying
they
would
go
over
to
the
british
and
get
attended
to
in
hospital
abdul
ali
was
put
on
ahmed
miserable
mount
with
his
legs
lashed
under
the
horse
belly
ahmed
with
mahommed
ben
hamza
and
his
men
were
sent
along
ahead
being
unarmed
unmounted
they
were
a
liability
now
but
those
hebron
thieves
could
talk
like
an
army
they
put
up
a
prodigious
bleat
all
night
long
about
that
they
maintained
they
had
a
clear
right
to
share
its
contents
since
unless
they
had
first
captured
abdul
ali
anazeh
men
could
not
have
burned
his
house
and
seized
his
money
anazeh
men
when
they
had
time
to
be
were
suitably
amused
it
was
not
a
peaceful
retreat
by
any
means
time
and
again
before
morning
we
were
fired
on
from
the
rear
our
party
deployed
to
right
and
left
to
answer
always
boasting
afterward
of
having
killed
at
least
a
dozen
men
i
added
up
their
figures
on
the
of
the
pocket
bible
and
the
total
came
to
two
hundred
and
eighteen
of
the
enemy
shot
dead
and
forever
damned
i
believe
anazeh
actually
did
kill
one
of
our
pursuers
by
the
time
the
moon
disappeared
we
had
come
too
close
to
anazeh
country
to
make
pursuit
particularly
safe
who
they
were
who
pursued
us
hauled
off
we
reached
the
launch
secure
in
its
cove
between
the
rocks
a
few
minutes
after
dawn
anazeh
ordered
his
six
wounded
men
into
it
with
perfect
assurance
that
the
british
doctors
would
take
care
of
them
and
let
them
go
unquestioned
when
grim
had
finished
talking
with
anazeh
i
went
up
to
thank
the
old
fellow
for
my
escort
and
he
acknowledged
the
courtesy
with
a
bow
that
would
have
graced
the
court
of
solomon
give
the
old
bird
a
present
if
you
got
one
grim
whispered
so
i
gave
him
my
watch
and
chain
and
he
accepted
them
with
the
same
calm
dignity
now
he
your
friend
for
life
said
grim
anazeh
is
a
friend
worth
having
let
go
the
watch
and
chain
was
a
cheap
enough
price
to
pay
for
that
two
days
entertainment
and
the
acquaintance
of
such
a
splendid
old
king
of
thieves
anazeh
watched
us
away
until
we
were
out
of
earshot
he
and
grim
exchanging
the
interminable
arab
farewell
formula
of
blessing
and
reply
that
have
been
in
use
unchanged
for
a
thousand
years
then
abdul
ali
produced
his
wallet
again
major
grim
he
said
please
take
this
money
keep
it
for
yourself
and
let
me
go
surely
i
have
been
punished
enough
besides
you
can
not
you
dare
not
imprison
me
i
am
a
french
subject
i
have
been
seized
outside
the
british
sphere
i
know
you
are
a
poor
man
the
pay
of
a
british
officer
is
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
come
now
you
have
done
what
you
came
to
do
you
have
destroyed
my
influence
at
now
benefit
yourself
avoid
an
international
complication
show
mercy
on
me
take
this
money
say
that
i
gave
you
the
slip
in
the
dark
grim
smiled
he
looked
extremely
comical
without
any
eyebrows
the
wrinkles
went
all
the
way
up
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
i
incorruptible
he
said
the
boss
i
believe
is
you
mean
your
high
commissioner
i
have
not
enough
money
for
him
grim
laughed
no
he
said
he
comes
expensive
what
then
do
be
an
ass
said
grim
you
know
what
information
certainly
what
information
you
were
sent
by
the
french
said
grim
to
raise
the
devil
here
in
palestine
no
matter
why
you
were
trying
to
bring
off
a
raid
on
judaea
who
are
your
friends
in
jerusalem
who
were
ready
to
spring
surprises
what
surprises
who
your
jerusalem
agent
if
i
tell
you
i
not
the
boss
but
i
see
him
about
it
come
on
your
agent
scharnhoff
grim
whistled
that
he
did
not
believe
i
was
almost
certain
but
he
whistled
as
if
totally
new
trains
of
thought
had
suddenly
revealed
themselves
amid
a
maze
of
memories
you
shall
speak
to
the
boss
he
said
after
a
while
i
fell
asleep
then
wedged
uncomfortably
between
two
men
legs
wakened
at
intervals
by
the
noisy
pleading
of
mahommed
ben
hamza
and
his
men
for
what
they
called
their
rights
in
the
matter
of
abdul
ali
wallet
they
were
still
arguing
the
point
when
we
ran
on
the
beach
near
jericho
where
a
patrol
of
incredulous
sikhs
pounced
on
us
and
wanted
to
arrest
ahmed
and
wounded
men
grim
had
an
awful
time
convincing
them
that
he
was
a
british
officer
in
the
end
we
only
settled
it
by
tramping
about
four
miles
to
a
where
a
captain
in
uniform
gave
us
breakfast
and
telephoned
for
a
commisariat
lorry
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
when
we
reached
jerusalem
and
got
the
wounded
into
hospital
by
the
time
grim
had
changed
into
uniform
and
put
courtplaster
where
his
eyebrows
should
have
been
and
he
abdul
ali
and
i
had
driven
in
an
official
ford
up
the
mount
of
olives
to
oeta
the
sun
was
not
far
over
the
skyline
grim
had
telephoned
so
the
administrator
was
waiting
for
us
grim
went
straight
in
it
was
twenty
minutes
before
we
two
were
summoned
into
his
private
room
where
he
sat
behind
the
desk
exactly
as
we
had
left
him
the
other
morning
he
looked
as
if
he
had
not
moved
meanwhile
everything
was
exactly
in
its
place
even
the
vase
covering
the
white
spot
on
the
varnish
there
was
the
same
arrangement
of
too
many
flowers
in
a
vase
too
small
to
hold
them
allow
me
to
present
sheikh
abdul
ali
of
damascus
said
grim
the
administrator
bowed
rather
elaborately
perhaps
to
hide
the
twinkle
in
his
eyes
he
did
scowl
he
did
look
tyrannical
so
abdul
ali
opened
on
him
with
all
bow
guns
i
protest
i
am
a
french
subject
i
have
been
submitted
to
violence
outrage
indignity
i
have
been
seized
on
foreign
soil
and
brought
here
by
force
against
all
international
law
i
shall
claim
exemplary
damages
i
demand
apology
and
satisfaction
sir
louis
raised
his
eyebrows
and
looked
straight
at
grim
without
even
cracking
a
smile
is
this
true
major
grim
afraid
it
is
sir
scandalous
perfectly
scandalous
and
were
you
a
witness
to
all
this
he
asked
looking
at
me
as
if
i
might
well
be
the
cause
of
it
all
i
admitted
having
seen
the
greater
part
of
it
and
you
did
protest
what
the
world
coming
to
i
see
you
lost
a
little
skin
yourself
i
hope
you
not
been
breaking
bounds
and
fighting
he
is
a
most
impertinent
man
said
abdul
ali
trying
to
take
his
cue
and
glowering
at
me
he
posed
as
a
person
interested
in
a
school
for
and
afterward
helped
capture
me
by
a
trick
the
administrator
frowned
it
seemed
i
was
going
to
be
made
the
i
did
not
care
i
would
not
have
taken
a
year
of
sir
louis
pay
for
those
two
days
and
nights
when
he
spoke
again
i
expected
something
drastic
addressed
to
me
but
i
was
wrong
an
official
apology
is
due
to
you
sheikh
abdul
ali
permit
me
to
offer
it
together
with
my
profound
regret
for
any
slight
personal
inconvenience
to
which
you
may
have
been
subjected
in
course
of
this
ah
entirely
unauthorized
piece
of
ah
brigandage
i
notice
you
have
been
bruised
too
you
shall
have
the
best
medical
attention
at
our
disposal
that
is
not
enough
sneered
abdul
ali
throwing
quite
an
attitude
i
know
it
is
i
was
coming
to
that
an
apology
is
also
due
to
the
french
our
friends
the
french
i
shall
put
it
in
writing
and
ask
you
to
convey
it
to
beirut
to
the
french
high
commissioner
with
my
compliments
i
would
send
you
by
train
but
you
might
be
ah
delayed
at
damascus
in
that
case
perhaps
emir
feisal
might
detain
you
there
will
be
a
boat
going
from
jaffa
in
two
days
time
two
days
will
give
you
a
chance
to
recover
from
the
outrageous
experience
before
we
escort
you
to
the
coast
a
passage
will
be
reserved
for
you
by
wire
and
you
will
be
put
on
board
with
every
possible
courtesy
you
might
ask
the
french
high
commissioner
to
let
me
know
if
there
is
anything
further
he
would
like
us
to
do
about
it
now
i
ring
for
a
clerk
to
take
you
to
the
medical
officer
under
escort
so
that
you
may
be
subjected
to
further
outrage
or
indignity
good
evening
anything
more
for
me
asked
grim
as
soon
as
abdul
ali
had
been
led
away
not
tonight
grim
come
and
see
me
in
the
morning
grim
saluted
the
administrator
looked
at
me
smiled
mischievously
have
a
good
time
he
asked
do
neglect
those
scratches
good
evening
no
more
not
another
word
he
never
did
say
another
word
to
me
about
it
although
i
met
him
afterwards
a
score
of
times
you
could
help
but
admire
and
like
him
grim
led
the
way
up
the
tower
stairs
again
and
we
took
a
last
look
at
the
moon
was
beginning
to
rise
above
the
rim
of
the
moab
hills
the
land
beyond
the
dead
sea
was
wrapped
in
utter
silence
over
to
the
you
could
make
out
one
dot
of
yellow
light
to
prove
that
men
lived
and
moved
and
had
their
being
in
that
stillness
otherwise
you
could
believe
it
was
real
country
it
looked
like
a
vision
of
the
home
of
dreams
got
anything
to
do
tonight
asked
grim
can
you
stay
awake
i
know
where
some
jews
are
going
to
play
beethoven
in
an
upper
room
in
the
ancient
city
care
to
come
chapter
eleven
and
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
ahaziah
i
have
no
idea
what
grim
did
during
the
next
few
days
i
spent
the
time
studying
arabic
and
saw
nothing
of
him
until
he
walked
into
my
room
at
the
hotel
one
afternoon
sat
down
and
came
straight
to
the
point
had
enough
no
got
the
hang
of
it
yes
i
think
so
i
answered
allah
peace
as
they
call
it
depends
on
the
french
they
intend
to
get
damascus
and
all
syria
so
they
sent
down
abdul
ali
of
damascus
to
make
trouble
for
the
british
in
palestine
the
idea
being
to
force
the
british
to
make
common
cause
with
them
that
would
mean
total
defeat
for
the
arabs
and
great
britain
would
save
france
scads
of
men
and
money
but
you
pulled
that
plug
i
saw
you
do
it
i
heard
abdul
ali
of
damascus
tell
you
scharnhoff
name
did
you
go
after
scharnhoff
no
not
yet
he
answered
you
no
diplomat
i
knew
that
i
have
never
wished
to
be
one
never
having
met
a
professional
one
who
did
not
so
to
speak
play
poker
with
a
cold
deck
and
at
least
five
aces
the
more
frankly
they
seem
to
be
telling
the
truth
the
more
sure
you
may
be
they
are
lying
neither
are
you
i
answered
you
a
sportsman
are
you
allowing
scharnhoff
weight
for
age
and
a
fair
start
or
what
he
chuckled
you
believed
old
of
damascus
he
a
french
secret
political
agent
so
whatever
he
told
us
is
certainly
not
true
or
if
it
is
true
or
partially
true
then
it
the
kind
of
truth
that
is
deadlier
deceptive
than
a
good
clean
lie
get
this
such
men
as
abdul
ali
would
face
torture
rather
than
betray
an
associate
unless
they
sure
the
associate
is
a
traitor
or
about
to
become
one
a
government
ca
easily
punish
its
own
spies
on
foreign
territory
but
by
betraying
them
it
can
sometimes
get
the
other
government
to
do
it
that
abdul
ali
betrayed
scharnhoff
to
me
proves
one
of
two
things
abdul
ali
was
lying
and
scharnhoff
harmless
or
in
some
way
scharnhoff
has
fallen
foul
of
his
french
paymasters
and
they
want
him
punished
very
likely
he
has
drawn
french
money
for
their
purposes
and
has
misused
it
for
his
own
ends
or
perhaps
they
have
promised
him
money
and
wish
to
back
down
possibly
he
knows
too
much
about
their
agents
and
they
want
him
silenced
they
propose
to
have
us
silence
him
i
going
to
call
on
scharnhoff
you
suspect
him
of
double
treachery
i
suspect
him
of
being
a
damned
old
visionary
i
had
met
hugo
scharnhoff
long
before
the
war
he
had
been
a
professor
of
orientology
at
vienna
university
at
the
moment
he
was
technically
an
enemy
alien
but
he
had
lived
so
many
years
in
jerusalem
and
was
reputed
so
studious
and
harmless
that
the
british
let
him
stay
there
after
allenby
captured
the
city
a
man
of
moderate
private
means
he
owned
a
stone
house
in
the
german
colony
with
its
back
to
the
valley
of
hinnom
care
to
come
grim
asked
me
yes
know
your
bible
he
proceeded
to
quote
from
it
and
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
ahaziah
which
he
did
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
israel
what
of
it
that
was
set
down
in
aramaic
nowadays
called
hebrew
something
like
three
thousand
years
ago
said
grim
it
aramaic
magic
let
take
a
look
at
it
we
trudged
together
down
the
dusty
bethlehem
road
turned
to
the
east
just
short
of
the
pool
of
the
sultan
where
they
now
had
a
delousing
station
for
british
soldiers
and
went
nearly
to
the
end
of
the
colony
of
neat
stone
villas
that
the
germans
built
before
the
war
and
called
rephaim
it
was
a
prosperous
colony
until
the
kaiser
putting
two
and
two
made
five
of
them
and
had
to
guess
again
the
house
we
sought
stood
back
from
the
narrow
road
at
a
corner
surrounded
by
a
low
stone
wall
and
a
mass
of
rather
dense
shrubs
that
obscured
the
view
from
the
windows
the
front
door
was
a
thing
of
solid
we
had
to
hammer
on
it
for
several
minutes
there
was
no
bell
a
woman
opened
it
at
last
an
arab
in
native
costume
eyed
as
they
all
are
and
quite
good
looking
although
hardly
in
her
first
youth
her
face
struck
me
as
haunted
she
was
either
ashamed
when
her
eyes
met
grim
or
else
afraid
of
him
but
she
smiled
pleasantly
enough
and
without
asking
our
business
led
the
way
at
once
to
a
room
at
the
other
end
of
a
long
hall
that
was
crowded
with
all
sorts
of
curios
they
were
mostly
stone
of
moabite
pottery
and
that
kind
of
thing
with
a
pretty
liberal
covering
of
ordinary
house
dust
in
fact
the
house
had
the
depressing
feel
of
a
rarely
visited
museum
the
room
she
showed
us
into
was
the
library
three
walls
lined
with
books
mostly
with
german
titles
a
big
cupboard
in
one
corner
reaching
from
floor
to
ceiling
a
big
desk
by
the
window
three
armchairs
and
a
stool
there
were
no
pictures
and
the
only
thing
that
smacked
of
ornament
was
the
persian
rug
on
the
floor
we
waited
five
minutes
before
scharnhoff
came
in
looking
as
if
we
had
disturbed
his
nap
he
was
an
untidy
stout
man
with
green
goggles
and
a
grayish
beard
probably
not
yet
sixty
years
of
age
and
well
preserved
he
kept
his
pants
up
with
a
belt
and
his
shirt
bulged
untidily
over
the
top
when
he
sat
down
you
could
see
the
ends
of
thick
combinations
stuffed
into
his
socks
he
gave
you
the
impression
of
not
fitting
into
western
clothes
at
all
and
of
being
out
of
sympathy
with
most
of
what
they
represent
he
was
cordial
enough
after
one
swift
glance
around
the
room
brought
a
new
acquaintance
for
you
said
grim
introducing
me
i
told
him
how
all
the
subalterns
come
to
you
for
palestinian
lore
ach
the
young
lotharios
each
man
a
don
juan
all
they
come
to
me
for
is
tales
of
turkish
harems
of
which
i
know
no
more
than
any
one
they
are
not
interested
in
subjects
of
real
importance
many
wives
had
djemal
pasha
how
many
of
them
were
european
that
is
what
they
ask
me
when
i
discuss
ancient
history
it
is
only
about
king
solomon
harem
that
they
care
to
know
or
possibly
about
the
modern
dancing
girls
of
kerak
who
are
all
spies
but
there
is
no
need
to
inform
you
as
to
that
eh
i
have
seen
you
for
a
long
time
major
grim
what
have
you
been
doing
nothing
much
i
was
at
the
tomb
of
the
kings
yesterday
scharnhoff
smiled
scornfully
now
you
must
have
some
whiskey
to
take
the
taste
of
that
untruth
out
of
your
mouth
how
can
a
man
of
your
attainments
call
that
obviously
modern
fraud
by
such
a
name
the
place
is
not
nearly
two
thousand
years
old
it
is
probably
the
tomb
of
a
syrian
queen
named
adiabene
and
her
family
josephus
mentions
it
this
land
is
full
every
square
metre
of
it
of
false
antiquities
with
real
names
and
real
antiquities
that
never
have
been
discovered
but
why
should
a
man
like
you
major
grim
lend
yourself
to
perpetuating
falsity
he
walked
over
to
the
cupboard
to
get
whiskey
and
from
where
we
sat
we
could
both
of
us
see
what
he
was
doing
the
cupboard
was
in
two
parts
top
and
bottom
without
any
intervening
strip
of
wood
between
the
doors
which
fitted
tightly
when
he
opened
the
top
part
the
lower
door
opened
with
it
he
kicked
it
shut
again
at
once
but
i
had
seen
inside
not
that
it
was
interesting
at
the
moment
he
set
whiskey
and
tumblers
on
the
desk
poured
liberally
and
went
on
talking
tomb
of
the
kings
hah
tomb
of
the
kings
of
judah
hah
if
any
one
can
find
that
he
will
have
something
more
important
than
ludendorff
memoirs
something
merkwurdig
believe
me
he
stiffened
suddenly
and
looked
at
grim
through
the
green
goggles
as
if
he
were
judging
an
antiquity
perhaps
this
is
not
the
time
to
make
you
a
little
suggestion
eh
grim
face
wrinkled
into
smiles
this
man
knows
enough
to
hang
me
anyhow
fire
away
ah
but
i
would
not
like
him
to
hang
me
he
as
close
as
a
clam
what
your
notion
nothing
serious
but
between
us
three
then
you
and
i
are
both
foreigners
in
this
place
major
grim
although
i
have
made
it
my
home
for
fifteen
years
you
have
no
more
interest
in
this
government
and
its
ridiculous
rules
than
i
have
what
do
you
say
shall
we
find
the
tomb
of
the
kings
together
grim
wrinkled
into
smiles
again
and
glanced
down
at
his
uniform
yes
exactly
agreed
scharnhoff
that
is
the
whole
point
they
call
me
an
enemy
alien
i
am
to
all
intents
and
purposes
a
prisoner
you
are
a
british
officer
can
do
what
you
like
go
where
you
like
you
wear
red
tabs
you
are
on
the
staff
nobody
will
dare
to
question
you
these
english
have
stopped
all
exploration
until
they
get
their
mandate
after
that
they
will
take
good
care
that
only
english
societies
have
the
exploration
privilege
but
what
if
we
you
and
i
that
is
to
say
between
us
extract
the
best
plum
from
the
pudding
before
those
miscalled
statesmen
sign
the
mandate
eh
it
can
be
done
it
can
be
done
grim
chuckled
i
suppose
you
already
see
a
picture
of
you
and
me
with
an
ancient
tomb
in
our
trunks
say
a
few
tons
of
the
more
artistic
parts
beating
it
for
the
frontier
and
hawking
the
stuff
afterward
to
furniture
dealers
pour
me
another
whiskey
prof
and
then
we
go
steal
the
mosque
of
omar
ach
you
laugh
at
me
you
jest
you
mock
you
sneer
but
i
know
what
i
propose
do
you
know
what
will
be
found
in
that
tomb
of
the
kings
of
judah
when
we
discover
it
bones
dry
bones
a
few
gold
ornaments
perhaps
a
stale
smell
certainly
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
israel
think
of
it
a
parchment
roll
perhaps
two
or
three
rolls
not
too
big
to
go
into
a
valise
worth
more
than
all
the
other
ancient
manuscripts
in
the
world
all
put
together
himmel
what
a
find
that
would
be
what
a
record
what
a
refutation
of
all
the
historians
and
the
fools
who
set
themselves
up
for
authorities
nowadays
what
a
price
it
would
bring
what
would
your
metropolitan
museum
in
new
york
not
pay
for
it
what
would
the
jews
not
pay
for
it
they
would
raise
millions
among
them
and
pay
any
price
we
cared
to
ask
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
israel
only
think
but
why
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
israel
in
the
tomb
of
the
kings
of
judah
grim
asked
more
by
way
of
keeping
up
the
conversation
i
think
than
because
he
could
not
guess
the
answer
he
is
an
omnivorous
reader
and
there
is
not
much
recorded
of
the
near
east
that
he
does
not
know
do
you
know
your
history
you
know
of
course
that
after
king
solomon
died
the
jews
divided
into
two
kingdoms
the
jews
speak
of
themselves
as
israelites
but
they
are
nothing
of
the
kind
they
are
the
tribe
of
judah
remained
in
jerusalem
forming
one
small
kingdom
their
descendants
are
the
jews
of
today
part
of
the
tribe
of
benjamin
stayed
with
them
the
other
seceding
ten
tribes
called
themselves
the
kingdom
of
israel
everybody
knows
that
said
grim
what
of
it
well
the
assyrians
came
down
and
conquered
the
kingdom
of
israel
marched
all
the
israelites
away
into
captivity
and
they
vanished
out
of
history
from
that
day
to
this
their
book
of
chronicles
so
often
referred
to
in
the
old
testament
has
never
been
seen
nor
heard
of
of
course
not
said
grim
the
king
of
assyria
used
it
to
wipe
his
razor
on
when
he
was
through
shaving
every
morning
ach
you
joke
again
but
i
tell
you
i
am
not
joking
such
people
as
those
hebrews
are
naturally
secretive
and
so
proud
that
they
wrote
down
for
posterity
all
the
doings
of
their
puny
kings
would
never
have
let
their
records
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
assyrians
they
themselves
were
marched
away
in
but
they
left
their
book
behind
them
safely
hidden
be
sure
of
it
ten
years
ago
i
found
a
manuscript
in
the
place
they
now
call
nablus
which
in
those
days
was
schechem
schechem
was
the
capital
of
the
kingdom
of
israel
just
as
jerusalem
was
the
capital
of
the
kingdom
of
judah
or
the
jews
i
sold
that
manuscript
for
a
good
price
after
i
had
photographed
it
the
idiots
to
whom
i
sold
it
historians
they
call
themselves
value
it
only
as
a
relic
of
antiquity
i
made
a
digest
of
it
analyzed
it
studied
it
compared
it
with
other
authentic
facts
in
my
possession
and
came
to
the
definite
conclusion
that
i
hold
the
clue
to
the
whereabouts
of
that
lost
book
of
chronicles
let
see
the
photograph
grim
suggested
it
has
been
impounded
with
other
property
by
your
friends
the
british
i
suppose
they
thought
the
german
general
staff
might
get
hold
of
it
and
conquer
the
suez
canal
but
what
good
would
the
sight
of
it
do
you
could
understand
a
word
of
it
it
convinced
me
after
months
of
study
that
when
the
ten
tribes
were
carried
away
into
captivity
by
the
assyrians
they
sent
their
records
secretly
to
jerusalem
ever
since
the
secession
the
israelites
and
jews
had
been
jealous
enemies
but
they
were
relatives
after
all
boasting
a
common
ancestor
proud
of
the
same
history
more
or
less
observing
the
same
religion
and
schechem
was
only
about
thirty
miles
from
jerusalem
which
was
considered
an
impregnable
fortress
until
the
babylonians
took
it
later
on
so
they
sent
their
records
to
jerusalem
and
the
jews
hid
them
where
where
do
you
suppose
the
likeliest
place
would
be
solomon
temple
you
think
so
then
you
think
superficially
my
young
friend
let
us
return
to
that
tomb
of
the
kings
again
for
a
moment
that
place
that
you
visited
is
such
an
obvious
fake
that
even
the
make
light
of
it
the
one
thing
in
palestine
that
never
yet
has
been
discovered
is
the
real
tomb
of
the
kings
yet
jerusalem
where
it
certainly
must
be
has
been
searched
and
looted
a
hundred
times
from
end
to
end
therefore
you
follow
me
the
jews
must
have
concealed
it
very
cunningly
answer
me
then
would
the
jews
who
were
always
a
practical
people
and
not
like
the
egyptians
have
taken
all
that
trouble
to
hide
the
tomb
of
their
kings
unless
there
were
important
treasure
in
it
answer
me
so
you
expect
to
find
treasure
in
addition
to
the
lost
book
of
chronicles
certainly
i
do
the
treasure
will
make
the
whole
proceeding
safe
let
the
british
have
it
the
fools
will
be
so
blinded
by
the
glamour
of
gold
that
i
shall
easily
extract
the
things
of
real
value
the
invaluable
manuscripts
then
let
the
men
who
call
themselves
historians
take
a
back
seat
he
rubbed
his
hands
together
in
anticipation
were
you
looking
for
the
tomb
of
the
kings
then
before
the
war
grim
asked
him
not
exactly
under
the
turks
it
was
difficult
the
turks
were
beautifully
corrupt
by
paying
for
it
i
could
get
permission
to
excavate
on
any
property
owned
by
christians
but
the
minute
i
touched
moslem
places
the
turks
became
fanatical
the
arabs
now
are
different
fanatics
too
but
with
a
new
sort
of
fanaticism
new
to
them
i
mean
the
kind
that
made
the
french
revolutionists
destroy
everything
their
ancestors
had
set
value
on
there
are
plenty
of
arabs
so
full
of
this
disease
of
bolshevism
that
they
would
make
it
easy
for
me
to
desecrate
what
others
believe
is
holy
ground
but
these
idiots
of
english
are
worse
than
the
turks
they
have
stopped
all
excavation
they
are
so
afraid
of
bolshevism
that
if
they
could
they
would
imitate
joshua
and
make
the
sun
stand
still
well
what
the
idea
asked
grim
finishing
his
whiskey
scharnhoff
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
know
my
position
i
am
helpless
here
on
suffrance
obliged
by
idiotic
regulations
to
sit
in
idleness
but
if
i
could
find
a
british
officer
with
brains
surely
there
must
be
one
somewhere
one
with
some
authority
who
is
considered
above
suspicion
i
could
show
him
perhaps
how
to
get
rich
without
committing
any
crime
he
need
feel
ashamed
of
i
could
not
see
grim
eyes
from
where
i
sat
and
he
did
not
make
any
nervous
movement
that
could
have
given
him
away
yet
i
was
conscious
of
a
new
alertness
and
i
think
scharnhoff
detected
it
too
for
he
changed
his
tactics
on
the
instant
hah
hah
i
was
joking
nobody
who
is
fool
enough
to
be
a
professional
soldier
would
be
clever
enough
to
find
the
tomb
of
the
kings
and
keep
the
secret
for
ten
minutes
hah
hah
but
i
have
a
favour
i
would
like
to
beg
of
you
major
grim
i
no
particular
authority
you
know
ach
the
administrator
listens
to
you
i
am
assured
of
that
he
listens
sometimes
yes
then
usually
does
the
other
thing
well
what
the
request
a
simple
one
there
is
a
risk
not
much
but
just
a
little
risk
that
some
fool
might
stumble
on
that
secret
of
the
tomb
of
the
kings
and
get
away
with
the
treasure
now
did
you
ever
set
a
thief
to
catch
a
thief
hah
hah
i
would
be
a
better
than
any
you
could
find
i
know
jerusalem
from
end
to
end
i
know
all
the
likely
places
why
do
you
get
permission
for
me
to
wander
about
jerusalem
undisturbed
and
keep
my
eye
open
for
if
i
am
not
to
have
the
privilege
of
discovering
that
book
of
chronicles
at
least
i
would
like
to
see
that
no
common
plunderer
gets
it
surely
i
am
known
by
now
to
be
harmless
surely
they
do
suspect
me
any
longer
of
being
an
agent
of
the
kaiser
or
any
such
nonsense
as
that
why
not
make
use
of
me
get
me
a
permit
please
major
grim
to
go
where
i
please
by
day
or
night
without
interference
usually
work
at
night
you
know
all
right
said
grim
i
try
to
do
that
ah
i
always
knew
you
were
a
man
of
good
sense
have
more
whiskey
a
cigar
then
ca
promise
anything
of
course
said
grim
but
you
shall
have
an
answer
within
hours
outside
as
we
turned
our
faces
toward
jerusalem
gray
wall
grim
opened
up
a
little
and
gave
me
a
suggestion
of
something
in
the
wind
did
you
see
what
he
has
in
that
cupboard
yes
two
arab
costumes
two
short
did
you
notice
the
grayish
dust
on
the
rug
three
or
four
footprints
at
the
corner
near
the
cupboard
ca
say
i
did
no
you
would
be
looking
for
it
these
men
who
pose
as
intellectuals
never
believe
that
any
one
else
has
brains
they
fool
themselves
there
one
thing
no
man
can
afford
to
do
east
of
the
sun
or
west
of
the
moon
you
can
steal
slay
intrigue
burn
break
all
the
ten
commandments
except
one
and
have
a
chance
to
get
away
with
it
there
just
one
thing
you
ca
do
and
succeed
he
done
it
and
the
thing
is
cheat
a
woman
you
mean
his
house
keeper
she
who
answered
the
door
grim
nodded
chapter
twelve
you
know
you
get
scuppered
if
you
found
out
two
days
passed
again
without
my
seeing
grim
although
i
called
on
him
repeatedly
at
the
junior
staff
officers
mess
below
the
zionist
hospital
suliman
the
imp
of
arab
mischief
who
did
duty
as
met
me
on
each
occasion
at
the
door
and
took
grinning
delight
in
disappointing
me
he
was
about
three
and
a
half
feet
high
with
a
tarboosh
worn
at
an
angle
on
his
kinky
hair
and
a
flashing
white
grin
across
his
face
that
would
have
made
an
archangel
count
the
change
out
of
two
piastres
twice
suliman
and
cool
cheek
were
as
obvious
as
the
gemini
and
i
was
one
of
a
good
number
that
included
every
single
member
of
that
unofficial
mess
who
could
never
quite
see
what
grim
found
so
admirable
in
him
grim
never
explained
taking
the
cue
from
his
master
neither
did
suliman
ever
explain
anything
to
any
one
but
grim
who
seemed
to
understand
him
perfectly
jimgrim
not
here
no
not
coming
back
much
business
somehow
you
could
suspect
that
kid
of
telling
the
truth
however
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
go
away
with
a
conviction
in
the
small
of
your
back
that
he
was
grinning
mischievously
after
you
grim
had
found
him
one
day
starving
and
lousy
in
the
archway
of
the
jaffa
gate
warming
his
fingers
at
a
guttering
preparatory
to
making
a
meal
off
the
wax
he
took
him
home
and
made
martha
the
old
russian
clean
him
with
kerosene
and
soft
soap
gave
him
a
big
to
sleep
in
along
with
julius
caesar
the
mascot
and
thereafter
broke
him
in
and
taught
him
things
seldom
included
in
a
school
curriculum
in
the
result
suliman
adored
grim
with
all
the
concentrated
zeal
of
of
which
almost
any
small
boy
is
capable
but
under
the
shadow
of
grim
protection
he
feared
not
even
hats
nor
regarded
civilians
although
he
was
dreadfully
afraid
of
devils
the
was
a
relic
of
his
negroid
ancestry
some
arab
sheikh
probably
captured
his
on
a
superstition
lingers
in
dark
veins
longer
than
any
other
human
failing
i
think
i
called
five
times
before
he
confessed
at
last
reluctantly
that
grim
was
in
that
was
in
the
morning
after
breakfast
and
i
was
shown
into
the
room
with
the
fireplace
and
the
deep
armchairs
grim
was
reading
but
seemed
to
me
more
than
usually
reserved
as
if
the
book
had
been
no
more
than
a
screen
to
think
behind
that
left
him
in
a
manner
unprotected
when
he
laid
it
down
i
talked
at
random
and
he
hardly
seemed
to
be
listening
say
he
said
suddenly
interrupting
me
you
came
out
of
that
affair
pretty
creditably
suppose
i
let
you
see
something
else
from
the
inside
will
you
promise
not
to
shout
it
all
over
jerusalem
use
your
own
judgment
i
answered
you
must
ask
questions
all
right
if
any
one
in
the
administration
pounces
on
you
in
the
course
of
it
you
have
to
drop
out
and
know
nothing
agreed
it
may
prove
a
bit
more
risky
than
the
business
could
be
i
answered
you
ca
talk
enough
arabic
to
get
away
with
but
could
you
act
deaf
and
dumb
sure
in
three
languages
you
understand
i
no
authority
to
let
you
in
on
this
i
might
catch
hell
if
i
were
found
out
doing
it
but
i
need
help
of
a
certain
sort
i
want
a
man
who
is
likely
to
be
spotted
by
the
gang
i
after
get
behind
that
screen
quick
it
was
a
screen
that
hid
a
door
leading
to
the
pantry
and
the
servants
quarters
there
was
a
windsor
chair
behind
it
and
it
is
much
easier
to
keep
absolutely
still
when
you
are
fairly
comfortable
i
had
hardly
sat
down
when
a
man
wearing
spurs
who
trod
heavily
entered
the
room
and
i
heard
grim
get
up
to
greet
him
are
we
alone
a
voice
asked
gruffly
instead
of
answering
grim
came
and
looked
behind
the
screen
opened
the
door
leading
to
the
pantry
closed
it
again
locked
it
and
without
as
much
as
a
glance
at
me
returned
to
face
his
visitor
well
general
what
is
it
this
is
strictly
secret
i
bet
it
is
said
grim
if
it
about
missing
explosives
i
know
more
than
you
do
my
god
it
out
two
tons
of
tnt
intended
for
the
air
force
gone
without
a
trace
the
story
out
i
know
it
catesby
sent
me
word
by
messenger
last
night
from
ludd
after
you
put
him
under
arrest
damn
the
man
well
that
what
happened
catesby
fault
they
blame
me
the
truck
containing
the
stuff
was
run
into
a
siding
three
days
ago
through
young
catesby
negligence
it
was
left
there
without
a
guard
catesby
will
be
broke
for
that
as
sure
as
my
name
is
jenkins
but
by
the
knell
of
hell
bells
grim
more
than
catesby
will
lose
their
jobs
unless
we
find
the
stuff
two
tons
half
enough
to
blow
up
palestine
too
bad
about
catesby
said
grim
never
mind
catesby
damn
him
consider
my
predicament
how
can
i
go
to
the
administrator
with
a
story
about
missing
tnt
and
nothing
done
about
it
nothing
done
you
passed
the
buck
have
you
catesby
is
under
arrest
you
say
what
do
you
mean
i
know
catesby
grim
retorted
quietly
he
made
that
fine
stand
at
beersheba
when
the
arabs
rushed
the
camp
and
you
were
looking
he
took
the
blame
for
your
carelessness
and
never
squealed
you
took
the
credit
for
his
presence
of
mind
and
have
treated
him
like
a
dog
ever
since
you
expect
me
to
try
to
save
your
bacon
and
forget
catesby
nonsense
grim
you
talking
without
your
book
here
what
happened
the
stuff
arrived
at
ludd
in
a
truck
attached
to
the
end
of
a
mixed
train
the
sent
me
a
memorandum
and
stalled
the
truck
on
a
siding
i
gave
the
memorandum
to
catesby
traffic
officer
he
tells
me
in
the
note
i
received
last
night
that
you
did
nothing
of
the
kind
then
he
a
liar
he
forgot
all
about
it
and
did
nothing
when
the
air
force
sent
to
get
the
stuff
the
truck
was
empty
and
you
want
me
to
find
it
i
suppose
yes
the
quicker
the
better
and
be
a
party
to
breaking
catesby
i
like
my
job
but
not
that
much
you
refuse
then
to
hunt
for
the
tnt
i
take
my
orders
straight
from
the
administrator
he
expects
me
in
half
an
hour
you
want
me
to
smooth
the
way
for
you
with
sir
louis
i
much
more
interested
in
catesby
who
would
face
a
firing
party
sooner
than
soak
another
fellow
for
his
own
fault
catesby
assures
me
in
writing
that
the
first
he
ever
heard
of
that
tnt
was
when
you
ordered
him
arrested
after
discovery
of
the
loss
his
word
goes
as
far
as
i
concerned
if
you
want
me
to
help
you
find
another
goat
than
catesby
that
my
answer
there
followed
quite
a
long
pause
perhaps
jenkins
was
wondering
what
chance
he
would
stand
in
a
whoever
had
heard
the
mess
and
canteen
gossip
knew
that
career
had
been
one
long
string
of
miracles
by
which
he
had
attained
promotion
without
in
any
way
deserving
it
and
a
parallel
series
of
even
greater
ones
by
which
he
had
saved
himself
from
ruin
by
contriving
to
blame
some
one
else
you
want
me
to
catesby
he
said
at
last
if
you
pounce
quickly
on
the
tnt
no
one
need
know
it
was
lost
if
you
catesby
the
public
shall
know
who
lost
it
and
who
did
even
if
it
costs
me
my
commission
blast
you
insubordination
is
your
car
outside
grim
answered
why
do
you
drive
me
up
to
the
administrator
and
charge
me
with
it
do
be
an
idiot
i
came
to
you
to
avoid
a
scandal
if
this
news
gets
out
there
be
a
panic
things
are
touchy
enough
as
it
is
yes
well
if
i
drop
the
charge
against
catesby
then
i
shall
not
have
to
fight
for
him
i
see
what
i
can
do
be
definite
damn
and
blast
you
all
right
i
clear
catesby
in
that
ominous
minute
like
the
devil
in
an
drama
suliman
knocked
at
the
door
leading
from
the
outer
hall
grim
opened
it
and
i
heard
the
boy
voice
piping
up
in
arabic
the
administrator
was
in
his
car
outside
waiting
to
know
whether
major
grim
was
indoors
where
your
car
i
heard
grim
ask
i
sent
the
man
to
get
a
tire
changed
jenkins
answered
then
sir
louis
need
know
you
here
do
you
want
to
see
him
of
course
not
you
can
get
behind
that
screen
if
you
like
i
thought
jenkins
would
explode
when
he
found
me
sitting
there
he
was
a
big
man
with
a
black
moustache
waxed
into
points
and
a
neck
the
color
of
rare
roast
beef
a
man
not
given
to
in
any
shape
or
form
but
he
had
to
make
a
quick
decision
sir
louis
footsteps
were
approaching
he
glared
at
me
made
a
sign
to
me
to
sit
still
twisted
his
moustache
savagely
and
listened
breathing
through
his
mouth
to
avoid
the
whistle
of
his
hairy
nostrils
i
heard
grim
start
toward
the
hall
but
sir
louis
turned
him
back
and
came
straight
in
it
occurred
to
me
i
save
you
the
time
of
coming
up
to
see
me
this
morning
grim
and
look
in
on
you
instead
before
i
start
my
rounds
any
new
developments
not
yet
sir
i
need
hours
if
we
move
too
fast
they
may
touch
the
stuff
off
before
we
get
the
whole
gang
in
the
net
you
sure
you
rather
not
have
the
police
quite
they
mean
well
but
they
clumsy
all
the
same
the
thing
ticklish
there
are
rumours
about
all
ready
the
grand
came
to
me
before
breakfast
with
a
wild
tale
i
promised
him
some
sikhs
for
special
sentry
duty
he
hardly
gone
before
some
zionists
came
with
a
story
that
the
arabs
are
planning
to
blow
up
their
hospital
i
gave
them
ten
men
and
an
officer
religious
head
of
the
moslem
community
is
the
city
quiet
grim
asked
him
fair
to
middling
the
jews
refused
to
take
their
shutters
down
this
morning
i
had
to
issue
an
order
about
it
i
hear
now
that
they
doing
business
about
as
usual
but
i
ordered
the
number
of
men
on
duty
within
the
city
walls
to
be
doubled
at
the
first
sign
of
disturbance
i
shall
have
the
gates
closed
are
you
quite
sure
you
in
touch
quite
sure
sir
i
positive
of
what
i
told
you
last
night
will
you
be
seeing
colonel
goodenough
yes
in
ten
minutes
please
ask
him
to
hold
his
sikhs
at
my
disposal
for
the
next
two
days
you
might
add
sir
that
if
he
cares
to
see
sport
he
could
do
worse
than
lend
his
own
services
i
do
that
you
can
count
on
goodenough
that
a
soldier
devoid
of
nonsense
anything
else
that
all
keep
me
informed
remember
grim
i
responsible
for
all
you
do
i
endorsed
you
in
blank
as
it
were
do
overlook
that
point
i
wo
sir
sir
louis
walked
out
almost
before
his
spurs
ceased
jingling
in
the
tiled
hall
jenkins
strode
out
in
a
towering
rage
from
behind
the
screen
my
soul
a
spy
trick
he
exploded
had
an
eavesdropper
did
you
listening
from
behind
a
screen
while
you
tricked
me
into
a
promise
on
catesby
account
sure
grim
answered
folding
the
screen
back
and
letting
his
face
wrinkle
in
smiles
all
the
way
up
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
very
comical
he
looked
for
his
eyebrows
were
only
partly
sprouted
again
had
two
of
you
to
listen
in
on
the
administrator
endorses
you
in
blank
eh
how
long
would
he
let
the
endorsement
stand
if
he
knew
i
was
behind
that
screen
while
he
was
talking
to
you
try
him
grim
suggested
shall
i
call
him
back
he
want
to
break
you
told
me
so
in
fact
last
night
but
he
could
change
his
mind
i
daresay
my
tip
to
you
is
to
get
back
to
ludd
as
fast
as
your
car
can
take
you
release
catesby
and
say
as
little
as
possible
to
any
one
damn
you
for
a
yankee
jenkins
answered
you
got
me
cornered
for
the
moment
and
you
make
the
most
of
it
but
wait
till
my
turn
comes
as
for
you
sir
jenkins
turned
and
looked
me
up
and
down
with
all
the
arrogance
that
nice
new
crossed
swords
on
his
shoulder
can
give
a
certain
sort
of
man
do
let
me
catch
you
trying
to
interfere
in
any
administration
business
that
all
i
offered
him
a
cigarette
grinning
there
was
no
sense
in
picking
a
quarrel
no
man
likes
to
discover
that
a
perfect
stranger
has
overheard
his
intimate
confessions
his
annoyance
was
understandable
but
he
had
nice
manners
he
knocked
the
cigarette
case
out
of
my
hand
and
kicked
it
across
the
room
so
i
got
into
one
of
the
deep
armchairs
and
laughed
at
him
in
defense
to
preserve
my
own
temper
from
boiling
up
over
the
top
to
hell
with
both
of
you
jenkins
thundered
and
strode
out
like
mars
on
the
poor
old
jinks
said
grim
as
soon
as
he
had
gone
as
sir
louis
said
last
night
he
has
a
wife
and
family
besides
the
unofficial
ladies
on
his
string
all
they
have
to
divide
between
them
soon
at
the
rate
he
going
will
be
his
he
has
fought
for
promotion
all
his
days
to
keep
abreast
of
expenses
what
that
string
of
cormorants
will
do
with
his
four
hundred
pounds
a
year
when
he
oversteps
at
last
and
gets
retired
beggars
imagination
however
let
get
busy
business
consisted
in
dressing
me
up
as
an
arab
with
the
aid
of
suliman
and
drilling
me
painstakingly
for
both
of
them
using
every
trick
they
knew
to
make
me
laugh
or
show
surprise
and
grim
nodding
approval
each
time
i
contrived
not
to
more
difficult
than
acting
deaf
and
dumb
was
the
trick
of
squatting
with
my
legs
crossed
but
i
had
learned
it
after
a
fashion
in
india
years
ago
and
only
needed
schooling
you
get
scuppered
if
you
caught
he
warned
me
if
suliman
was
so
scared
of
devils
i
would
risk
it
but
i
must
have
somebody
to
keep
an
eye
on
him
when
the
time
comes
be
tomorrow
i
think
suppose
you
tell
me
the
object
of
the
game
i
suggested
sick
of
only
studying
the
rules
well
your
part
will
be
to
sit
over
those
two
tons
of
tnt
and
see
that
nobody
explodes
them
ahead
of
time
there
a
conspiracy
on
foot
to
blow
up
the
dome
of
the
rock
you
mean
the
mosque
of
omar
the
place
tourists
call
the
mosque
of
omar
the
site
of
solomon
temple
the
rock
of
abraham
the
of
araunah
the
jebusite
next
after
the
shrine
at
mecca
it
the
most
sacred
spot
in
the
whole
mahommedan
world
good
lord
i
said
are
the
zionists
so
reckless
no
the
arabs
are
remember
what
old
scharnhoff
said
the
other
day
about
the
new
fanaticism
is
scharnhoff
mixed
up
in
it
he
being
watched
if
the
arabs
pull
it
off
they
accuse
the
jews
of
doing
it
and
set
to
work
to
butcher
every
jew
in
the
near
east
that
will
oblige
the
british
to
protect
the
jews
that
in
turn
will
set
every
mohammedan
in
the
world
indians
but
egyptians
too
against
the
british
jihad
green
banner
holy
war
all
the
east
and
northern
africa
alight
while
the
french
snaffle
syria
sound
good
to
you
sir
louis
knows
this
he
is
paid
to
know
things
and
he
lets
you
play
cat
and
mouse
with
it
got
to
be
careful
suppose
we
draw
the
net
too
soon
what
then
most
of
the
conspirators
escape
the
story
leaks
out
the
jews
get
the
blame
for
the
attempt
and
sooner
or
later
the
massacre
begins
anyhow
what
we
got
to
do
is
bag
every
last
son
of
them
and
suppress
the
whole
story
return
the
tnt
to
store
and
swear
it
was
never
missing
the
administrator
has
his
nerve
i
said
you
need
yours
too
before
this
game
played
grim
answered
see
now
why
i
picked
on
you
for
an
accomplice
i
do
not
you
the
one
man
in
jerusalem
whom
nobody
will
suspect
or
be
on
the
for
the
men
we
up
against
are
the
shrewdest
rats
in
palestine
they
got
a
list
of
british
officers
my
name
included
of
course
they
know
which
men
are
assigned
to
special
duty
and
they
keep
every
one
of
us
shadowed
wo
that
i
mean
how
can
you
work
if
you
shadowed
me
i
shall
catch
my
spur
in
the
carpet
fall
downstairs
and
break
a
leg
at
at
the
doctor
comes
and
finds
me
too
badly
hurt
to
be
moved
he
sends
word
of
it
to
sir
louis
by
an
orderly
who
can
be
trusted
to
talk
to
any
one
he
meets
on
the
way
i
leave
by
the
back
way
at
ten
however
here
a
chance
for
you
to

suliman
chapter

you
may
now
be
unsafe
and
an
outlaw
and
enjoy
yourself
the
man
who
entered
was
a
short
jew
of
the
type
that
writes
political
reviews
for
magazines
black
morning
coat
straw
hat
gold
a
neatly
trimmed
dark
beard
beginning
to
turn
gray
from
intense
mental
emotion
nearly
bald
a
manner
of
conceding
the
conventions
rather
than
argue
the
point
without
admitting
any
necessity
for
them
a
smile
that
apologized
for
smiling
in
a
world
so
serious
and
bitter
he
wore
a
gold
piece
on
his
watch
chain
by
way
of
establishing
his
nationality
well
eisernstein
trouble
again
sit
down
and
let
hear
the
worst
said
grim
eisernstein
remained
standing
and
glanced
at
me
over
in
the
corner
i
will
wait
until
you
are
alone
ignore
him
deaf
and
dumb
grim
answered
half
a
minute
though
have
you
had
breakfast
breakfast
this
is
no
time
for
eating
mister
i
beg
your
pardon
major
grim
i
have
not
slept
i
shall
not
break
my
fast
until
my
duty
is
done
if
it
is
true
that
the
emperor
nero
fiddled
while
rome
burned
then
i
find
him
no
worse
than
this
administrator
has
he
threatened
to
crucify
you
grim
asked
take
a
seat
do
he
may
crucify
me
and
i
will
thank
him
if
he
will
only
in
return
for
it
pay
some
attention
to
the
business
for
which
he
draws
a
salary
i
drove
to
headquarters
to
see
him
he
was
not
there
nobody
would
tell
me
where
he
is
i
drove
down
again
from
the
mount
of
olives
and
luckily
caught
sight
of
his
car
in
the
distance
i
contrived
to
intercept
him
i
told
him
there
is
a
plot
on
foot
to
massacre
every
individual
of
my
race
in
the
near
east
a
veritable
pogrom
he
was
polite
he
seems
to
think
politeness
is
the
christian
quality
that
covers
the
multitude
of
sins
he
offered
me
a
cigar
i
offered
him
a
telegram
blank
with
which
to
cable
for
reenforcements
he
said
that
all
rumours
in
jerusalem
become
exaggerated
very
quickly
and
offered
me
a
guard
of
one
soldier
to
follow
me
about
i
insisted
on
immediate
military
precautions
on
a
large
scale
failing
which
i
will
cable
the
foreign
office
in
london
at
my
own
expense
i
offered
to
convince
him
with
particulars
about
this
contemplated
pogrom
but
he
said
he
had
an
urgent
appointment
and
referred
me
to
you
just
as
nero
might
have
referred
a
question
regarding
the
amphitheatre
to
one
of
his
subordinates
pogroms
mean
nothing
in
his
young
life
grim
answered
smiling
i
here
to
do
the
dirty
work
suppose
you
spill
the
news
you
must
have
heard
the
news
yet
you
ignore
it
the
moslems
are
saying
that
we
zionists
have
offered
two
million
pounds
or
some
such
ridiculous
sum
for
the
site
of
solomon
temple
they
are
spreading
the
tale
broadcast
their
purpose
is
to
stir
up
fanaticism
against
us
the
ignorant
among
them
set
such
value
on
that
rock
and
the
mosque
their
ancestors
erected
on
it
that
jews
are
now
openly
threatened
as
they
pass
through
the
streets
yet
there
is
not
one
word
of
truth
in
the
story
of
our
having
made
any
such
offer
there
are
plenty
of
troops
said
grim
any
attempt
at
violence
could
be
handled
instantly
then
you
will
do
nothing
what
do
you
suggest
ought
to
be
done
here
is
a
list
read
it
those
are
the
names
of
fifty
arabs
who
are
active
in
spreading
propaganda
grim
read
the
list
carefully
all
talkers
he
said
not
a
really
dangerous
man
among
them
ah
there
you
are
i
might
have
expected
it
eisernstein
threw
up
his
hands
in
a
gesture
of
contempt
rather
than
despair
nobody
cares
what
happens
to
jews
nobody
cares
for
our
sleepless
agony
of
mind
nobody
cares
how
or
what
we
suffer
until
afterward
when
there
will
be
polite
expressions
of
regret
which
the
survivors
will
assess
at
a
true
valuation
it
is
the
same
wherever
we
turn
last
night
at
one
in
the
morning
a
committee
of
us
every
one
american
called
at
the
american
consulate
to
tell
our
consul
of
our
danger
the
consul
was
unsympathetic
in
the
last
degree
yet
our
coreligionists
in
the
states
are
taxed
to
pay
his
salary
he
said
it
was
not
his
business
he
referred
us
to
the
administrator
the
administrator
refers
me
to
you
to
whom
do
you
refer
me
to
the
devil
i
suppose
the
best
thing
you
can
do
said
grim
is
to
go
ahead
and
deny
that
story
about
the
offer
to
buy
the
dome
of
the
rock
you
zionists
have
got
the
most
efficient
publicity
bureau
on
earth
you
can
reach
the
public
ear
any
time
you
want
to
deny
the
story
and
keep
on
denying
it
ah
who
will
believe
us
to
be
a
zionist
is
to
be
a
person
about
whom
anybody
will
believe
anything
and
the
more
absurd
the
lie
the
more
readily
it
will
be
believed
meanwhile
the
moslems
are
sharpening
their
swords
against
us
from
one
end
of
this
land
to
the
other
i
suppose
that
what
eisernstein
really
needed
more
than
anything
was
sympathy
not
good
advice
grim
deliberate
coolness
only
irritated
the
passion
of
a
man
whose
whole
genius
and
energy
were
bent
on
realizing
the
vision
of
a
nation
of
jews
firmly
established
in
their
ancient
home
a
people
that
has
been
tortured
in
turn
by
all
the
governments
can
hardly
be
expected
to
produce
politicians
he
was
at
the
mercy
of
emotions
obsessed
by
one
paramount
idea
a
little
praise
just
then
of
his
loyalty
to
an
ideal
to
which
he
had
sacrificed
time
means
health
energy
everything
would
have
soothed
him
and
hurt
nobody
but
the
acidity
of
his
scorn
had
bitten
beneath
the
surface
of
grim
good
humor
there
be
no
pogrom
grim
said
getting
up
and
lighting
a
cigarette
there
be
nothing
resembling
one
but
that
be
the
fault
of
you
zionists
you
accuse
without
rime
or
reason
but
you
yell
for
help
the
minute
you
accused
yourselves
i
do
blame
the
arabs
for
not
liking
you
nobody
expects
arabs
to
enjoy
having
their
home
invaded
by
an
organization
of
foreigners
yet
if
this
administration
lifts
a
finger
to
make
things
easier
for
the
arabs
you
howl
that
it
unfair
if
the
administrator
refuses
to
arrest
arabs
for
talking
a
little
wildly
you
call
him
a
nero
i
neither
nor
zionist
myself
you
and
the
arabs
may
play
the
game
out
between
you
for
all
of
me
but
i
can
promise
you
there
be
no
pogrom
it
is
my
business
to
know
just
what
precautions
have
been
taken
words
major
grim
words
sneered
eisernstein
getting
up
to
go
what
do
words
amount
to
when
presently
throats
are
to
be
cut
if
your
throat
were
in
danger
i
venture
to
say
there
would
be
something
doing
instead
of
mere
talk
about
precautions
i
hope
you
will
enjoy
your
little
cigarette
he
added
bitterly
good
morning
talk
of
fiddling
while
rome
burns
grim
laughed
as
soon
as
the
zionist
had
left
the
room
has
it
ever
occurred
to
you
that
nero
was
possibly
smothering
his
feelings
i
wonder
how
long
there
be
one
zionist
left
out
here
if
we
simply
stood
aside
and
looked
on
go
and
change
your
clothes
suliman
it
time
i
broke
a
leg
grim
disappeared
upstairs
himself
and
returned
about
ten
minutes
later
in
the
uniform
of
a
shereefian
officer
that
is
to
say
of
emir
feisul
syrian
army
nothing
could
be
smarter
not
anything
better
calculated
to
disguise
a
man
disguise
as
any
actor
or
detective
can
tell
you
is
not
so
much
a
matter
of
up
as
suggestion
it
is
little
mannerisms
unstudied
habits
that
identify
the
suggestion
that
you
are
some
one
else
is
the
thing
to
strive
for
not
the
concealment
of
who
you
really
are
grim
skin
had
been
in
the
arab
campaign
under
lawrence
against
the
turks
the
shereefian
helmet
is
a
compromise
between
the
east
and
west
having
a
strip
of
cloth
hanging
down
behind
it
as
far
as
the
shoulders
and
covering
the
ears
on
either
side
to
take
the
place
of
the
arab
the
khaki
uniform
had
just
enough
of
oriental
touch
about
it
to
distinguish
it
from
that
of
a
british
officer
no
man
inexperienced
in
disguise
would
dream
of
choosing
it
for
the
simple
reason
that
it
would
not
seem
to
him
disguise
enough
yet
grim
now
looked
so
exactly
like
somebody
else
that
it
was
hard
to
believe
he
was
the
same
man
who
had
been
in
the
room
ten
minutes
before
his
mimicry
of
the
syrian
military
walk
blended
of
pride
and
desire
not
to
seem
proud
was
perfect
i
now
ali
mirza
of
feisul
army
he
announced
ali
mirza
a
man
notorious
for
his
rancor
but
supposed
to
be
down
here
just
now
on
a
diplomatic
mission
been
seen
about
the
streets
like
this
for
the
last
two
days
but
say
that
doctor
is
a
long
time
on
the
way
he
went
to
the
telephone
but
did
not
call
the
hospital
that
would
have
been
too
direct
and
possibly
too
secret
give
me
headquarters
yes
who
that
never
mind
speaking
say
i
ca
get
the
military
hospital
something
wrong
with
the
wire
will
you
call
major
templeton
and
say
that
major
grim
has
had
an
accident
yes
grim
compound
fracture
of
the
thigh
very
serious
ask
him
to
go
at
once
to
major
quarters
thanks
that
all
he
returned
to
the
fireplace
and
stood
watching
me
meditatively
for
several
minutes
if
you
deceive
templeton
you
do
he
said
at
last
wait
a
minute
he
went
to
the
desk
and
scribbled
something
in
arabic
on
a
sheet
of
paper
sealed
that
in
a
blank
envelope
and
handed
it
to
me
hide
it
you
two
separate
and
quite
distinct
tasks
each
more
important
and
in
a
way
dangerous
than
the
other
the
principal
danger
is
to
me
not
you
if
they
spot
you
my
number
as
good
as
hoisted
from
that
minute
you
must
kid
yourself
you
safe
for
one
second
until
the
last
card
has
been
played
who
are
i
coming
to
that
your
first
job
is
to
make
it
possible
for
me
to
get
the
confidence
of
one
or
two
of
these
conspirators
you
a
man
stone
deaf
with
a
message
for
captain
ali
mirza
which
you
will
only
deliver
to
him
in
person
suliman
does
the
talking
you
say
nothing
you
simply
refuse
to
hand
your
message
over
to
any
one
but
me
they
appreciate
why
a
deaf
and
dumb
man
should
be
chosen
for
treasonable
business
but
perhaps
you
scared
maybe
you
rather
reconsider
it
it
not
too
late
i
snorted
all
right
these
conspirators
meet
at
djemal
coffee
shop
on
david
street
they
talk
to
one
another
in
french
because
the
proprietor
and
the
other
frequenters
of
the
place
only
know
arabic
you
know
french
and
arabic
enough
to
understand
a
sentence
here
and
there
so
keep
your
ears
wide
open
i
show
up
until
a
sikh
named
narayan
singh
tells
me
that
a
certain
noureddin
ali
is
in
there
he
the
bird
i
after
he
a
dirty
little
murderer
and
i
going
to
be
right
pleasant
to
him
you
may
have
to
sit
in
the
place
all
day
waiting
for
me
but
wait
until
after
midnight
if
you
must
sooner
or
later
noureddin
ali
is
bound
to
show
up
i
shall
be
hard
after
him
if
they
offer
you
food
take
it
eat
with
your
fingers
eat
like
a
pig
lick
the
plate
if
you
like
the
nearer
mad
you
seem
to
be
the
safer
you
are
after
i
get
there
hang
around
until
i
give
you
money
then
beat
it
where
to
i
ca
go
to
my
room
at
the
hotel
in
this
disguise
i
thought
of
that
you
know
cosmopolitan
oil
davey
of
course
he
lives
at
the
hotel
i
get
word
to
him
that
he
may
expect
a
messenger
from
me
after
dark
tonight
he
leave
word
with
the
porter
downstairs
who
take
you
to
davey
room
you
can
tell
davey
absolutely
anything
he
white
well
i
think
i
can
execute
that
maneuver
what
task
number
two
to
sit
on
the
tnt
but
one
thing
at
a
time
is
enough
attend
to
this
one
first
ah
here
comes
templeton
damn
you
grim
said
a
calm
voice
in
the
doorway
a
tall
lean
man
in
major
uniform
with
the
blue
tabs
of
the
medical
staff
strode
in
he
had
the
look
of
the
sudan
added
to
the
that
comes
of
deciding
life
and
death
issues
at
a
moment
notice
the
hospital
is
crowded
with
patients
and
here
you
immobilize
me
for
half
a
morning
i
ca
pretend
to
set
a
compound
fracture
in
ten
minutes
you
know
why
could
you
break
your
neck
and
have
me
sign
a
death
certificate
did
occur
to
me
said
grim
but
never
mind
doc
you
need
a
rest
here
tobacco
lots
to
read
and
an
armchair
lock
yourself
in
and
be
happy
who
this
asked
templeton
looking
down
at
me
deaf
and
dumb
poor
devil
earning
a
few
piastres
by
working
for
the
intelligence
spy
eh
he
looks
fit
for
honest
work
if
he
had
all
his
faculties
is
he
dumb
as
well
as
deaf
or
because
he
deaf
dunno
said
grim
he
never
speaks
perhaps
i
can
do
something
for
him
suppose
you
leave
him
here
with
me
i
can
give
him
a
thorough
examination
instead
of
wasting
my
time
here
he
got
a
job
of
work
to
do
right
now
said
grim
does
he
know
the
sign
language
have
you
any
way
of
telling
him
to
come
and
see
me
at
the
hospital
i
give
him
written
instructions
in
arabic
that
so
i
look
at
his
ears
tell
you
in
a
minute
whether
it
worth
while
to
come
to
me
he
took
my
head
between
strong
authoritative
hands
and
tilted
it
sidewise
hello
what
this
the
arab
i
was
wearing
shifted
and
showed
symptoms
open
that
bag
of
mine
will
you
grim
and
pass
me
that
big
pair
of
forceps
you
find
wrapped
in
oiled
paper
on
top
of
everything
there
something
i
can
attend
to
here
at
once
it
was
an
uncomfortable
moment
grim
never
cracked
a
smile
he
dug
out
the
instrument
of
torture
and
gave
it
to
templeton
but
there
were
two
points
that
occurred
to
me
in
addition
to
the
knowledge
that
nothing
whatever
was
the
matter
with
my
ear
doctors
in
good
standing
who
are
usually
gentlemen
operate
without
permission
and
the
forceps
were
much
too
big
for
any
such
purpose
so
i
sat
still
what
he
really
needs
is
a
needle
run
down
close
to
the
it
would
take
five
minutes
or
hurt
him
much
after
that
i
think
he
be
able
to
hear
perfectly
suppose
we
try
i
can
wait
ten
minutes
yet
grim
answered
very
well
i
a
platinum
needle
in
the
bag
i
get
out
the
and
we
soon
see
to
be
candid
with
you
i
believe
the
man
any
more
deaf
than
you
or
i
if
you
run
a
hot
needle
through
the
lobe
of
his
ear
well
find
out
whether
he
can
really
talk
or
not
said
grim
in
his
pleasantest
voice
if
he
shamming
i
do
mind
what
we
need
in
this
service
is
a
man
who
can
endure
without
betraying
himself
well
we
soon
see
i
began
to
hate
grim
pretty
cordially
i
hated
him
more
when
suliman
came
in
dressed
for
the
street
in
a
rather
dirty
cotton
smock
with
a
turban
in
place
of
his
fez
he
told
the
boy
to
hold
the
wooden
handle
of
a
behind
my
ear
to
prevent
the
hot
needle
from
going
too
far
on
its
sizzling
journey
it
did
seem
to
me
the
way
to
reciprocate
volunteer
secret
service
suliman
grin
at
the
prospect
of
seeing
a
man
tortured
was
enough
to
provoke
murder
i
brushed
the
boy
aside
got
up
crossed
the
room
and
sat
down
again
in
the
corner
good
enough
laughed
grim
you
do
yes
i
think
he
do
agreed
templeton
but
i
took
no
notice
i
had
seen
too
many
games
lost
and
won
with
the
last
card
templeton
looked
down
at
suliman
tell
him
the
game
over
he
may
talk
now
mafish
mukhkh
no
brains
the
boy
answered
grinning
and
tapping
his
own
forehead
magnoon
mad
i
think
i
can
trust
them
both
said
grim
smiling
in
my
direction
all
right
old
man
time
out
if
you
spoken
once
there
have
been
nothing
more
between
you
and
a
life
of
safety
and
respectability
whereas
said
templeton
you
may
now
be
unsafe
and
an
outlaw
and
enjoy
yourself
are
you
sure
they
have
marked
him
he
asked
grim
sure
why
should
they
suspect
a
tourist
but
i
taken
precautions
word
is
on
the
way
to
the
hotel
to
forward
all
his
mail
to
jaffa
until
further
notice
he
laughed
at
me
again
i
hope
you
not
expecting
important
letters
suliman
had
evidently
been
well
schooled
in
advance
for
at
a
nod
from
grim
he
came
over
and
took
my
hand
as
if
i
were
blind
in
addition
to
the
other
supposed
infirmities
he
led
me
out
by
a
across
a
yard
into
an
alley
which
we
followed
as
far
as
a
main
road
and
then
turned
toward
the
jaffa
gate
looking
back
once
i
saw
grim
in
his
shereefian
uniform
striding
along
behind
us
but
where
the
road
forked
he
took
the
other
turning
there
is
contentment
in
walking
disguised
through
crowded
streets
even
when
you
are
in
tow
of
iniquity
that
regards
you
as
a
lump
of
baggage
to
be
pushed
this
and
that
way
suliman
plainly
considered
me
a
rank
outsider
only
admitted
into
the
game
on
sufferance
having
said
i
was
magnoon
he
lived
up
to
the
assertion
and
warned
people
to
make
way
for
me
if
they
did
not
want
to
be
bitten
and
go
mad
too
so
as
a
general
rule
i
received
a
pretty
wide
berth
but
it
was
fun
in
spite
of
suliman
it
was
like
seeing
the
world
through
a
men
and
women
you
knew
went
by
without
suspecting
they
were
recognized
and
in
a
puzzling
sort
of
way
the
world
that
had
been
your
world
yesterday
seemed
now
to
belong
wholly
to
other
people
while
you
lived
in
a
new
sphere
of
your
own
we
had
to
go
slowly
as
we
approached
the
jaffa
gate
for
the
crowd
was
dense
there
and
a
line
of
sikhs
was
drawn
across
the
gap
where
the
street
passes
through
the
city
wall
it
was
the
gap
the
turks
once
made
by
tearing
down
the
wall
to
let
the
kaiser
through
when
he
made
that
famous
meek
and
humble
pilgrimage
of
his
the
sikhs
were
searching
all
comers
for
weapons
and
we
had
to
wait
our
turn
outside
the
gate
on
the
as
you
faced
it
was
the
usual
line
of
the
only
cheap
thing
left
in
jerusalem
a
motley
two
dozen
of
soldiers
recently
fighting
the
british
gamely
in
the
last
ditch
and
now
blacking
their
boots
with
equal
gusto
for
rather
higher
pay
some
of
them
still
wore
turkish
uniforms
two
or
three
were
redheaded
and
and
almost
certainly
descended
from
scotch
crusaders
the
whole
wide
world
bears
witness
that
when
the
scots
went
soldiering
they
were
efficient
in
more
ways
than
one
the
rest
of
the
crowd
were
mainly
peasantry
with
of
stuff
for
market
but
there
was
a
liberal
sprinkling
among
them
of
all
the
odds
and
ends
of
the
levant
with
a
jew
here
and
there
the
inevitable
russian
priest
and
a
dozen
odd
lots
of
as
many
nationalities
whom
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
classify
and
there
was
police
constable
bedreddin
shah
you
could
not
have
missed
noticing
him
although
i
did
not
learn
his
name
until
afterwards
he
came
swaggering
down
the
jaffa
road
with
all
the
bullying
arrogance
of
the
newly
enlisted
arab
policeman
he
shoved
me
aside
calling
me
a
name
that
a
drunken
would
hesitate
to
apply
to
a
dog
in
the
gutter
he
was
on
his
way
to
the
that
stands
just
inside
the
gate
and
i
wished
him
a
year
in
it
as
he
plunged
into
the
crowd
that
checked
and
surged
immediately
in
front
of
the
line
of
sikhs
a
small
man
in
arab
costume
with
the
lower
part
of
his
face
well
covered
by
the
kaffiyi
rushed
out
from
the
corner
behind
the
bootblacks
and
drove
a
long
knife
home
to
the
hilt
between
the
policeman
i
was
shocked
i
was
even
sorry
that
hangs
down
over
the
shoulders
bedreddin
shah
shrieked
and
fell
forward
blood
gushed
from
the
wound
the
crowd
surged
in
curiously
and
then
fell
back
before
the
advancing
sikhs
a
british
officer
who
had
heard
the
victim
cry
came
spurring
his
horse
into
the
crowd
from
inside
the
gate
in
his
effort
to
get
near
the
victim
he
only
added
to
the
confusion
the
murderer
who
seemed
in
no
particular
hurry
dodged
quietly
in
and
out
among
the
swarm
of
bewildered
peasants
and
in
thirty
seconds
had
utterly
disappeared
a
minute
later
i
saw
grim
offering
his
services
as
interpreter
and
stooping
over
the
dying
man
to
try
to
catch
the
one
word
he
was
struggling
to
repeat
chapter
fourteen
windy
bellies
without
hearts
in
them
djemal
coffee
shop
is
run
by
a
turkish
gentleman
whose
real
name
is
yussuf
one
name
and
the
shorter
the
better
had
been
plenty
in
the
days
when
djemal
pasha
ran
jerusalem
with
iron
ruthlessness
and
consequent
success
of
a
certain
sort
when
djemal
was
the
turkish
governor
every
proprietor
of
every
kind
of
shop
had
to
stand
in
the
doorway
at
attention
whenever
djemal
passed
and
woe
betide
the
laggard
it
would
not
have
paid
any
one
in
those
days
to
name
any
sort
of
shop
after
djemal
pasha
even
the
provider
of
the
rope
that
throttled
the
offender
would
have
made
no
profit
because
the
rope
would
simply
have
been
looted
from
the
nearest
store
the
hangman
would
have
been
the
nearest
soldier
whose
pay
was
already
two
years
in
arrears
so
yussuf
own
name
done
in
turkish
characters
used
to
stand
over
the
door
before
the
british
came
it
was
djemal
pasha
considered
judgment
that
yussuf
cooked
the
best
coffee
in
jerusalem
so
whenever
the
despot
was
in
the
city
he
conferred
on
yussuf
the
inestimable
privilege
of
supplying
him
with
coffee
at
odd
moments
under
threat
of
the
bastinado
if
the
stuff
were
not
suitably
sweet
and
hot
the
only
money
that
ever
changed
hands
in
that
connection
was
when
the
came
down
on
yussuf
for
an
extra
levy
because
of
the
added
trade
that
conceivably
might
be
expected
to
accrue
through
the
advertisement
obtained
by
serving
such
an
exalted
customer
the
also
threatened
the
bastinado
and
as
the
man
who
likes
that
punishment
or
who
could
soften
the
heart
of
a
turkish
tax
assessor
has
yet
to
be
discovered
yussuf
invariably
paid
but
when
allenby
conquered
palestine
between
bouts
of
trying
to
tame
his
australians
and
djemal
pasha
scooted
into
exile
with
a
harem
packed
in
lorries
at
his
rear
yussuf
remembered
that
old
adage
about
better
late
than
never
he
put
djemal
name
on
the
stone
arch
of
the
narrow
door
near
the
foot
of
david
street
he
did
it
partly
out
of
the
disrespect
that
a
small
dog
feels
for
a
big
one
that
is
now
on
chain
but
he
was
not
overlooking
the
business
value
of
it
the
first
result
was
that
he
did
quite
a
lot
of
trade
with
british
officers
who
came
primarily
because
they
were
sick
of
eating
sand
and
and
drinking
sand
and
tepid
water
in
the
desert
later
they
flocked
there
by
way
of
paying
indirect
homage
to
a
governor
who
whatever
his
obvious
demerits
had
at
any
rate
never
been
answered
back
or
thwarted
with
impunity
there
was
a
time
after
the
capture
of
jerusalem
when
if
the
british
army
could
have
voted
on
it
djemal
pasha
would
have
been
brought
back
and
given
a
free
hand
but
the
officers
began
to
discover
that
yussuf
was
charging
them
four
or
five
times
the
proper
price
the
seniors
objected
promptly
and
deserted
to
the
inexpressible
delight
of
the
subalterns
but
even
the
extravagant
youths
grew
tired
of
extortion
after
a
month
or
two
and
yussuf
had
to
look
elsewhere
for
customers
yussuf
did
some
thinking
behind
that
genial
turkish
mask
of
his
competition
was
keen
there
are
more
coffee
shops
in
jerusalem
than
hairs
on
a
hog
back
and
the
situation
down
near
the
bottom
of
that
narrow
thoroughfare
in
the
shadow
of
an
ancient
arch
did
not
lend
itself
to
drawing
crowds
but
there
were
others
in
jerusalem
besides
the
british
officers
who
yearned
for
djemal
rule
again
and
unlike
the
irreverent
men
in
khaki
they
did
not
dare
to
voice
their
feelings
in
public
all
the
old
political
grafters
and
all
the
new
ones
savagely
resented
a
regime
under
which
bribery
was
not
permitted
and
as
always
happens
sooner
or
later
they
began
to
show
a
tendency
to
meet
in
certain
places
where
they
might
talk
violence
without
risk
of
incurring
it
so
yussuf
permitted
a
rumour
to
gain
ground
that
he
too
was
a
malcontent
and
that
the
british
had
deserted
his
coffee
shop
for
that
reason
he
gave
out
that
djemal
pasha
name
over
the
door
stood
for
reaction
and
political
intrigue
so
his
place
began
to
be
frequented
by
effendis
in
tarboosh
and
clothes
who
could
chew
the
cud
of
bitterness
aloud
between
walls
that
the
crusaders
had
built
four
feet
thick
the
only
entrance
was
through
the
narrow
front
door
where
yussuf
inspected
every
visitor
before
admitting
him
so
yussuf
cafe
djemal
pasha
was
the
place
to
go
to
for
politics
of
the
order
that
would
make
lenin
and
trotsky
sound
like
sports
but
first
you
had
to
get
by
yussuf
at
the
door
suliman
led
me
by
the
hand
down
david
street
through
the
yelly
moil
of
flies
and
barter
past
the
meat
and
vegetable
stalls
beneath
the
crusader
arches
from
which
jewish
women
peered
through
trellised
windows
across
three
transversing
lanes
of
the
ancient
suku
and
halted
at
yussuf
door
he
rapped
on
it
three
times
when
yussuf
wrinkled
face
appeared
at
last
suliman
demanded
to
see
ali
mirza
yussuf
eyes
peered
at
me
for
a
long
time
before
he
asked
a
question
atrash
akras
majnoon
deaf
dumb
mad
said
suliman
describing
me
as
mad
seemed
to
give
him
particular
delight
he
never
overlooked
a
chance
of
doing
it
ali
mirza
is
not
here
what
should
a
madman
want
with
him
he
is
not
very
mad
only
stupid
he
carries
a
message
for
the
captain
but
the
captain
is
not
here
he
has
not
been
here
he
will
come
how
should
a
man
deliver
a
message
it
is
in
writing
very
well
he
may
leave
the
writing
with
me
if
the
captain
comes
i
will
deliver
it
no
the
message
is
from
damascus
he
will
give
it
only
into
the
captain
own
hand
what
is
your
name
suliman
what
is
his
god
knows
he
came
with
another
man
by
train
and
the
other
man
who
is
much
more
mad
than
this
one
gave
me
five
piastres
to
bring
this
one
to
your
kahwi
yussuf
shut
the
door
and
discussed
the
proposition
with
his
customers
at
the
end
of
two
or
three
minutes
his
head
appeared
again
you
say
ali
mirza
is
expected
here
so
said
the
man
at
the
station
what
do
you
know
of
ali
mirza
nothing
once
more
the
door
closed
and
i
could
hear
the
murmur
of
voices
inside
but
only
a
confused
murmur
for
the
door
was
thick
when
it
opened
again
two
other
heads
were
peering
from
behind
yussuf
has
he
money
he
asked
kif
ma
indi
khabar
how
should
i
know
yussuf
opened
the
door
wide
and
made
a
sign
for
me
to
enter
he
seemed
in
two
minds
whether
to
let
suliman
come
in
with
me
or
not
but
finally
admitted
him
with
a
gruff
admonition
to
keep
still
in
one
place
and
not
talk
the
place
was
fairly
full
it
was
a
square
room
with
one
window
high
in
the
wall
on
david
street
around
three
sides
including
that
on
which
was
the
front
door
ran
a
wooden
seat
furnished
with
thin
cushions
facing
the
front
door
was
another
one
leading
to
a
dark
hole
in
the
rear
where
pots
were
washed
and
rice
was
boiled
beside
that
door
occupying
most
of
the
length
of
the
fourth
wall
was
a
thing
like
an
altar
of
dressed
stone
on
which
the
coffee
was
prepared
in
dozens
of
little
copper
pots
the
benches
being
pretty
well
occupied
i
was
about
to
squat
down
on
the
floor
but
they
made
room
for
me
close
to
the
front
door
so
i
squatted
on
the
corner
of
the
bench
and
tucked
my
legs
under
me
suliman
dropped
down
on
the
floor
in
front
of
me
with
his
head
about
level
with
my
knees
the
other
occupants
of
the
room
were
all
syrian
arabs
not
a
bedouin
among
them
all
of
them
wore
more
or
less
european
clothing
with
the
inevitable
tarboosh
each
set
at
a
different
angle
you
can
guess
the
mentality
of
the
syrian
by
the
angle
of
that
red
islamic
symbol
he
wears
on
his
head
the
black
tassel
normally
hangs
behind
and
the
conservatives
and
all
who
take
their
religion
seriously
wear
the
inverted
shaped
affair
as
nearly
straight
up
as
the
cranium
permits
but
once
let
a
syrian
take
up
new
politics
join
the
young
turk
party
forswear
religion
or
grow
cynical
about
accepted
doctrine
and
the
angle
of
his
tarboosh
shows
it
just
as
surely
as
the
angle
of
the
london
cockney
bowler
betrays
irreverence
and
the
new
york
gangster
lid
expresses
disguised
as
the
were
set
at
every
possible
angle
in
that
shop
of
yussuf
from
the
backward
tilt
of
the
breezy
optimist
to
the
thrust
down
over
the
eye
of
malignant
cynicism
which
usually
went
with
folded
arms
legs
thrust
out
straight
and
heels
together
on
the
floor
yussuf
brought
me
coffee
without
waiting
to
be
asked
i
paid
him
a
for
it
which
is
half
the
proper
price
and
utterly
ignored
his
expostulation
he
touched
me
on
the
shoulder
displayed
the
coin
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
and
went
through
a
prodigious
pantomime
i
did
not
even
try
to
appear
interested
he
ordered
suliman
to
explain
to
me
mafish
mukhkh
said
the
boy
touching
his
own
forehead
my
real
motive
was
to
act
as
differently
as
possible
from
the
white
man
who
always
pays
twice
what
he
should
by
establishing
the
suggestion
of
accustomed
meanness
i
hoped
to
offset
any
breaks
i
might
make
presently
spies
and
people
of
that
kind
usually
have
plenty
of
money
for
their
needs
so
that
by
acting
the
part
of
a
man
unused
to
spending
except
in
minute
driblets
i
stood
a
better
chance
of
not
being
detected
but
i
was
in
luck
i
have
often
noticed
so
that
it
has
become
almost
an
article
of
creed
with
me
that
luck
invariably
breaks
that
way
it
almost
never
turns
up
blind
you
sit
down
and
wait
for
luck
and
it
all
goes
to
the
other
fellow
but
start
to
use
your
wits
even
clumsily
and
the
luck
comes
along
and
squanders
itself
on
you
he
is
certainly
from
damascus
laughed
one
of
the
customers
the
price
is
a
in
damascus
at
the
meaner
shops
i
did
not
know
anything
about
damascus
then
had
never
been
there
but
from
that
minute
it
never
entered
the
mind
of
one
of
those
men
to
doubt
that
damascus
was
my
so
easily
satisfied
by
trifling
suggestions
is
the
unscientific
human
yussuf
went
back
to
his
charcoal
stove
grumbling
to
himself
in
turkish
but
there
was
still
one
question
in
doubt
they
seemed
satisfied
that
i
was
really
deaf
and
dumb
but
in
that
land
of
countless
mission
schools
and
alien
speech
there
is
always
a
chance
that
even
children
know
a
word
or
two
of
french
they
tested
suliman
with
simple
questions
such
as
who
was
his
mother
and
where
was
he
born
but
he
did
not
need
to
act
that
part
he
was
utterly
ignorant
of
french
so
they
proceeded
to
ignore
the
two
of
us
and
turn
their
political
acrimony
loose
in
french
discussing
the
maddest
most
unmoral
schemes
with
the
gusto
of
small
boys
playing
pirates
there
seemed
to
be
almost
as
many
rival
political
parties
as
men
in
the
room
the
only
approach
to
unity
was
when
they
agreed
to
accuse
and
destroy
as
for
constructive
agreement
they
had
none
and
every
one
suggestion
for
improvement
was
sneered
at
by
all
the
rest
they
were
not
even
agreed
about
the
zionists
except
hating
them
they
quarreled
about
what
would
be
the
best
way
to
take
advantage
of
them
before
wiping
them
out
of
existence
but
they
all
saw
exquisite
humour
in
the
item
of
news
that
eisernstein
had
taken
so
to
heart
that
was
noureddin
ali
idea
he
is
a
genius
to
accuse
the
zionists
of
offering
two
million
pounds
for
the
dome
of
the
rock
ah
who
else
could
have
thought
of
it
the
story
has
spread
all
through
jerusalem
and
is
on
its
way
to
the
villages
in
two
days
it
will
be
common
gossip
from
damascus
to
beersheba
in
a
week
it
will
be
known
from
end
to
end
of
egypt
then
arabia
then
india
ho
when
the
indian
moslems
get
the
news
the
indian
troops
in
palestine
will
send
it
by
mail
then
what
a
furor
then
what
anger
that
was
finesse
that
was
true
statesmanship
never
was
a
shrewder
genius
than
noureddin
ali
do
shout
his
name
too
loud
said
somebody
the
administration
suspects
him
already
bah
who
in
this
room
is
a
friend
of
the
administration
the
administrator
is
a
broken
shard
the
british
will
summon
him
home
for
inefficiency
besides
there
is
only
one
man
in
jerusalem
of
whom
noureddin
is
in
the
least
afraid
that
major
grim
the
american
and
whoever
would
give
the
price
of
a
cup
of
coffee
for
a
lease
of
the
life
of
major
grim
in
the
circumstances
would
do
better
to
toss
the
money
to
the
first
beggar
he
meets
hssh
hah
all
the
same
i
would
not
choose
to
be
noureddin
enemy
there
is
another
one
who
will
share
that
opinion
or
so
i
have
heard
i
was
told
that
bedreddin
shah
a
recent
recruit
in
the
police
stumbled
by
accident
on
certain
evidence
and
demanded
a
huge
sum
for
silence
how
much
will
anybody
give
bedreddin
shah
for
his
prospect
hssh
what
did
bedreddin
shah
discover
nobody
knows
you
mean
nobody
will
tell
the
same
thing
how
long
could
a
secret
be
kept
in
jerusalem
if
you
people
were
informed
of
what
is
going
on
you
are
good
for
propaganda
that
is
all
you
can
talk
allah
how
you
all
talk
but
as
for
doing
anything
or
keeping
a
secret
until
a
thing
is
done
you
are
no
better
than
magpies
the
last
speaker
was
a
rather
fat
man
over
in
the
corner
by
the
scullery
door
he
had
a
nose
like
sultan
abdul
hamid
and
large
elongated
eyes
that
looked
capable
of
seeing
things
on
either
side
of
him
while
he
stared
straight
forward
even
in
that
dark
corner
you
could
see
they
had
the
that
one
associates
with
cruelty
he
had
the
massive
shoulders
and
position
as
he
sat
on
the
seat
that
suggest
deliberate
purpose
devoid
of
hurry
they
all
resented
what
he
said
but
none
seemed
disposed
to
quarrel
with
him
one
or
two
remonstrated
mildly
but
he
ignored
their
remarks
busying
himself
with
digging
out
a
cigarette
from
a
gold
case
set
with
jewels
after
he
had
lighted
it
very
thoughtfully
and
examined
the
end
once
or
twice
to
make
sure
that
it
burned
just
right
he
let
it
hang
between
his
lips
in
a
way
that
accentuated
the
angle
of
his
bulbous
nose
you
wondered
whether
he
owned
a
harem
and
what
the
ladies
thought
of
him
will
you
sit
and
brag
in
here
all
day
he
asked
after
a
few
minutes
yussuf
must
be
getting
rich
you
sip
so
much
coffee
it
is
not
particularly
good
for
yussuf
to
get
rich
it
will
make
him
lazy
as
most
of
you
are
the
chattering
had
ceased
although
there
were
several
attempts
to
break
that
uncomfortable
silence
with
inane
remarks
his
ravenish
unpleasant
voice
seemed
to
act
on
the
company
like
a
chill
wind
depriving
treason
of
its
warm
sociableness
but
leaving
in
the
sting
i
said
you
are
good
for
propaganda
he
resumed
tossing
away
ash
with
a
reflective
air
but
even
that
has
no
value
within
four
walls
if
noureddin
ali
should
come
and
learn
from
me
how
much
talking
has
been
done
in
here
and
how
little
done
outside
i
can
imagine
he
will
not
be
pleased
are
there
no
other
kahawi
why
is
that
story
about
the
zionists
and
their
offer
to
buy
the
dome
of
rock
not
being
spread
diligently
you
like
the
safety
of
this
place
with
its
four
thick
walls
but
i
tell
you
the
jackal
has
to
leave
his
hole
to
hunt
they
did
not
like
taking
orders
even
when
they
were
expressed
more
or
less
indirectly
no
follower
of
the
new
political
freedom
does
like
it
for
it
rather
upsets
the
new
conceit
but
he
evidently
knew
his
politicians
and
they
him
they
got
up
one
by
one
and
made
for
the
door
each
offering
a
different
excuse
designed
to
cover
up
obedience
under
a
cloak
of
snappy
independence
not
one
of
them
drew
a
retort
from
him
or
as
much
as
a
farewell
nod
when
the
last
one
was
gone
and
the
process
took
up
all
of
he
sat
and
looked
down
his
nose
at
me
for
several
minutes
without
speaking
you
could
have
guessed
just
as
easily
what
an
alligator
was
thinking
about
and
i
tried
to
emulate
him
pretending
to
go
off
into
the
brown
study
that
the
turks
call
kaif
out
of
which
it
is
considered
bad
manners
to
disturb
your
best
friend
let
alone
a
stranger
but
manners
proved
to
be
no
barrier
in
his
case
he
began
talking
to
me
in
arabic
directly
at
me
slowly
and
deliberately
but
i
did
not
understand
very
much
of
it
and
it
was
not
difficult
to
pretend
i
did
not
hear
however
suliman
was
in
different
case
the
boy
began
to
get
very
restless
under
the
monolog
and
i
tugged
at
his
back
hair
more
than
once
to
remind
him
of
the
part
he
had
to
play
discovering
that
the
arabic
took
no
effect
on
me
the
alligator
person
changed
to
french
they
speak
french
in
damascus
i
know
you
are
not
deaf
you
are
a
spy
i
know
your
name
i
know
what
your
business
was
before
you
came
here
i
know
why
you
want
to
see
the
captain
you
have
a
letter
for
him
i
know
what
is
in
it
no
use
trying
to
deceive
me
i
have
ways
of
my
own
of
discovering
things
do
you
know
what
happens
to
spies
who
refuse
to
answer
my
questions
they
are
attended
to
quite
simple
they
receive
attention
nobody
hears
of
them
again
there
are
drains
in
jerusalem
big
dark
smelly
ancient
full
of
rats
very
useful
drains
you
think
the
ali
mirza
will
protect
you
at
a
word
from
me
he
will
make
the
request
that
you
receive
immediate
attention
you
will
disappear
down
a
drain
where
even
allah
will
forget
that
you
ever
existed
ali
mirza
is
my
old
friend
better
let
me
see
that
letter
i
felt
like
laughing
at
the
drain
threats
although
suliman
was
still
shivering
from
the
effect
of
the
earlier
arabic
version
but
the
statement
that
he
knew
the
real
ali
mirza
might
be
true
in
which
case
grim
disguise
was
not
going
to
last
long
however
the
fact
that
he
had
not
yet
seen
through
my
disguise
was
some
comfort
the
wish
being
father
of
the
thought
i
decided
he
was
bluffing
first
and
last
but
he
had
not
finished
yet
he
tried
me
in
english
the
captain
will
give
that
letter
to
me
in
any
case
it
is
intended
for
me
i
have
other
business
now
and
wish
to
save
time
so
give
it
to
me
at
once
here
i
will
give
you
ten
piastres
for
it
he
pulled
out
a
purse
and
unfolded
a
note
i
took
no
notice
he
shook
it
for
me
to
see
and
i
awoke
like
a
pelican
at
the
sight
of
fish
yours
for
that
letter
he
said
shaking
it
again
i
nudged
suliman
and
nodded
to
him
he
crossed
the
room
seized
the
note
and
brought
it
back
to
me
i
stowed
it
away
under
my
shirt
come
now
give
me
the
letter
i
took
utterly
no
notice
so
he
turned
his
attention
to
suliman
again
and
resumed
in
arabic
feel
in
his
pocket
and
find
the
letter
i
afraid
the
boy
answered
of
what
of
him
i
will
protect
you
take
the
letter
from
him
suliman
chose
to
play
the
small
boy
as
he
could
very
well
indeed
when
nothing
could
be
gained
by
being
devilish
and
up
he
shook
his
head
and
grinned
sheepishly
has
he
any
weapons
was
the
next
question
ma
indi
khabar
i
do
know
evidently
assault
and
battery
was
to
be
the
next
item
on
the
program
he
had
not
the
eyes
or
the
general
air
of
a
man
who
will
part
with
ten
piastres
for
nothing
he
called
to
yussuf
who
came
hurrying
out
of
the
scullery
place
they
held
a
whispered
conference
and
yussuf
nodded
then
he
came
over
to
the
front
door
and
locked
it
removing
the
key
tell
him
to
hand
over
that
letter
he
ordered
suliman
mafish
mukhkh
said
the
boy
tapping
his
forehead
once
more
suliman
notion
was
the
right
one
after
all
at
any
rate
the
only
one
available
old
alligator
rolled
off
his
perch
and
started
for
me
yussuf
timed
his
own
assault
to
correspond
they
would
have
landed
on
me
simultaneously
if
suliman
had
not
reminded
me
that
madness
is
a
safe
passport
nearly
anywhere
in
the
east
so
i
went
stark
raving
mad
that
minute
i
once
spent
a
night
in
the
room
of
an
epileptic
who
had
delirium
tremens
and
learned
a
lot
from
him
some
of
it
came
to
mind
just
when
i
needed
it
if
ever
a
man
got
ten
piastres
worth
of
unexpected
it
was
that
old
syrian
with
the
alligator
eyes
by
the
time
i
was
quite
out
of
breath
there
was
a
cushion
or
a
fit
for
business
suliman
was
standing
out
of
reach
on
the
bench
in
a
corner
yelling
with
laughter
while
the
two
men
struggled
to
get
through
the
scullery
door
which
was
too
narrow
to
admit
them
both
at
once
i
earned
that
ten
piastres
by
the
same
token
i
did
not
let
the
kaffiyi
fall
off
my
head
and
betray
my
western
origin
unable
to
think
up
any
more
original
motions
and
having
breath
for
none
i
sat
on
the
floor
and
spat
repeatedly
having
seen
a
madman
do
that
on
the
hebron
road
and
get
feared
if
not
respected
for
it
there
seems
to
be
a
theory
prevalent
in
that
part
of
the
world
that
the
sputum
of
a
madman
is
contagious
but
i
overdid
it
most
amateurs
do
overdo
things
they
got
so
afraid
that
they
decided
to
put
me
out
into
the
street
at
all
costs
where
those
enemies
of
society
the
police
might
demonstrate
their
ingenuity
yussuf
made
a
dash
for
the
front
door
and
i
suppose
he
would
have
called
in
help
and
ended
my
share
in
the
adventure
if
something
had
not
happened
the
something
was
noureddin
ali
very
much
something
in
his
own
opinion
why
did
you
open
the
door
sooner
he
demanded
i
have
been
knocking
for
two
minutes
he
watched
yussuf
lock
the
door
again
behind
him
and
then
eyed
the
disheveled
room
with
amused
curiosity
he
was
a
little
man
dressed
in
a
black
silk
jacket
worsted
pants
and
brown
boots
with
the
inevitable
tarboosh
set
at
an
angle
of
sheer
impudence
a
man
at
least
fifty
years
old
by
the
look
of
him
but
full
of
that
peppery
vigor
that
so
often
clings
to
little
men
in
middle
life
on
the
whole
he
looked
more
like
a
or
a
lawyer
then
a
conspirator
but
yussuf
addressed
him
with
great
deference
as
noureddin
ali
bey
and
even
old
became
obsequious
both
yussuf
and
the
other
man
began
explaining
the
situation
to
him
in
arabic
i
meanwhile
recovering
from
the
fit
as
fast
as
i
dared
and
trying
to
remember
how
to
do
it
noureddin
ali
was
plainly
for
having
me
thrown
out
until
they
mentioned
the
name
of
ali
mirza
at
that
he
tried
to
suliman
at
great
length
but
could
get
nothing
out
of
him
suliman
had
evidently
overheard
grim
talking
about
noureddin
ali
and
was
very
much
afraid
of
him
all
right
noureddin
ali
said
at
last
no
more
business
today
yussuf
keep
the
door
locked
but
admit
the
captain
we
must
find
out
what
this
message
is
about
yussuf
went
to
tidying
up
the
place
while
noureddin
ali
and
the
alligator
person
talked
excitedly
in
low
tones
in
the
corner
near
the
scullery
door
i
lay
on
the
floor
with
one
eye
open
expecting
grim
every
minute
but
it
must
have
been
four
in
the
afternoon
before
he
came
and
all
that
while
with
only
short
intervals
for
food
and
coffee
noureddin
ali
and
the
other
man
talked
steadily
discussing
over
and
over
again
the
details
of
some
plan
shortly
after
midday
suliman
began
to
whimper
for
food
yussuf
produced
a
mess
of
rice
and
mutton
of
which
the
two
syrians
ate
enormously
before
giving
any
to
the
boy
then
they
put
what
was
left
in
the
dish
on
the
floor
in
front
of
me
pretty
much
in
the
way
you
feed
a
dog
and
i
hate
to
remember
what
i
did
to
it
it
is
enough
that
i
did
not
overlook
grim
advice
to
eat
like
a
lunatic
and
however
suspicious
of
me
noureddin
ali
might
otherwise
have
been
he
was
satisfied
at
the
end
of
that
performance
several
people
tried
the
door
and
some
of
them
made
signals
on
it
but
yussuf
had
a
where
one
of
the
heavy
iron
nails
had
been
removed
and
after
a
cautious
squint
through
it
at
each
arrival
he
proceeded
to
ignore
them
one
man
thundered
on
the
door
for
several
minutes
but
was
allowed
to
go
away
without
as
much
as
a
word
of
explanation
that
was
the
first
incident
that
made
me
feel
quite
sure
nourreddin
ali
was
in
fear
of
the
police
all
the
time
the
thundering
was
going
on
he
glanced
furtively
about
him
like
a
rat
in
a
trap
i
saw
him
feel
for
a
weapon
under
his
when
the
noise
ceased
and
the
impatient
visitor
went
away
he
sighed
with
relief
the
place
was
certainly
a
trap
there
was
no
back
way
out
of
it
when
grim
came
at
last
he
knocked
quietly
and
waited
in
silence
while
yussuf
applied
his
eye
to
the
when
he
entered
the
only
surprising
thing
about
him
seemed
to
me
the
thinness
of
his
disguise
in
the
morning
when
i
had
seen
him
change
in
ten
minutes
from
west
to
east
it
had
seemed
perfect
but
having
looked
for
him
so
long
with
the
syrian
disguise
in
mind
it
seemed
impossible
now
that
any
one
could
be
deceived
by
it
he
was
at
no
pains
to
keep
the
kaffiyi
thing
close
to
his
face
and
i
held
my
breath
expecting
to
see
noureddin
ali
denounce
him
instantly
but
nothing
of
that
sort
happened
grim
sat
down
thrust
his
legs
out
in
front
of
him
leaned
back
and
called
for
coffee
it
was
obvious
at
once
that
the
alligator
person
had
been
lying
when
he
boasted
of
knowing
ali
mirza
for
he
made
no
effort
to
claim
acquaintance
or
to
denounce
him
as
an
impostor
but
he
nodded
to
suliman
and
suliman
came
over
and
nudged
me
i
let
the
boy
go
through
a
lot
of
pantomimic
argument
before
admitting
that
i
understood
but
finally
i
crossed
the
room
to
grim
and
offered
him
the
envelope
he
looked
surprised
examined
the
outside
curiously
spoke
to
me
shrugged
his
shoulders
when
i
did
not
answer
tossed
a
question
or
two
to
suliman
shrugged
again
and
tore
the
letter
open
then
his
face
changed
and
he
glanced
to
right
and
left
of
him
as
if
afraid
of
being
seen
he
stuffed
the
letter
into
his
tunic
pocket
and
i
went
back
to
the
corner
by
the
front
door
yussuf
was
pottering
about
still
rearranging
all
the
pots
and
furniture
that
i
had
scattered
but
his
big
ears
projected
sidewise
and
suggested
that
he
might
have
another
motive
however
it
was
a
simple
matter
to
evade
his
curiosity
by
talking
french
and
noureddin
all
could
contain
himself
no
longer
pardon
me
sir
ali
mirza
grim
nodded
suspiciously
i
have
heard
of
you
we
have
all
heard
of
you
we
are
proud
to
see
you
in
jerusalem
we
wish
all
success
to
your
efforts
on
behalf
of
mustapha
kemal
the
great
turkish
nationalist
leader
our
prayer
is
that
he
may
light
such
a
fire
in
anatolia
as
shall
spread
in
one
vast
conflagration
throughout
the
east
who
are
you
asked
grim
suspiciously
evidently
the
real
ali
mirza
had
a
reputation
for
gruff
manners
noureddin
ali
bey
it
may
be
you
have
heard
of
me
i
am
not
without
friends
in
damascus
oh
are
you
noureddin
ali
grim
attitude
thawed
appreciably
we
have
been
looking
for
more
action
and
less
talk
from
you
i
made
an
excuse
to
visit
jerusalem
and
discover
how
much
fire
there
is
under
this
smoke
of
boasting
fire
that
is
the
right
word
there
is
a
camouflage
of
talk
but
under
it
aha
you
shall
see
or
is
that
more
talk
we
are
not
all
talkers
wait
and
see
oh
more
waiting
has
mustapha
kemal
pasha
waited
in
anatolia
has
he
not
set
you
all
an
example
of
deeds
without
words
am
i
to
wait
here
indefinitely
in
jerusalem
to
take
him
news
of
deeds
that
will
never
happen
not
indefinitely
my
dear
captain
and
this
time
there
will
really
be
a
deed
that
will
please
even
such
a
rigorous
lover
of
action
as
mustapha
kemal
grim
shrugged
his
shoulders
again
i
leave
for
damascus
at
dawn
he
said
cynically
i
do
care
to
be
mocked
there
for
bringing
news
of
promises
we
have
had
too
many
of
those
barren
mares
i
shall
say
that
i
have
found
everything
here
is
sterile
the
talk
abortive
the
men
mere
windy
bellies
without
hearts
in
them
chapter
fifteen
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
noureddin
ali
was
pained
and
upset
grim
had
pricked
his
conceit
had
sent
thrust
home
where
he
kept
his
susceptibilities
he
blinked
peered
this
and
that
way
exchanged
glances
with
the
alligator
person
and
then
tucked
his
legs
up
under
him
in
me
you
see
a
doer
he
announced
he
looked
the
part
his
lean
pointed
nose
and
beady
little
eyes
were
of
the
interfering
meddling
type
you
could
not
imagine
him
like
the
ruminant
next
to
him
sitting
and
waiting
ruthlessly
for
things
to
happen
noureddin
ali
looked
more
likely
to
go
out
and
be
ruthless
so
they
all
say
grim
retorted
some
one
should
forewarn
them
in
damascus
what
a
deed
will
occur
here
presently
above
all
word
should
reach
mustapha
kemal
in
anatolia
as
soon
as
possible
so
that
he
may
be
ready
to
act
all
day
long
said
grim
i
have
wandered
about
jerusalem
listening
to
this
and
that
rumour
of
something
that
may
happen
but
i
have
not
found
one
man
who
can
tell
me
a
fact
that
is
because
you
did
not
meet
me
i
am
i
am
the
father
of
facts
you
say
you
leave
for
damascus
at
dawn
you
are
positive
i
could
tell
you
facts
that
would
put
a
sudden
end
to
my
career
if
they
were
spread
about
jerusalem
that
is
the
usual
boast
of
men
who
desire
credit
in
the
eyes
of
the
nationalist
party
grim
retorted
i
see
you
are
skeptical
that
is
a
wise
man
attitude
but
i
must
be
cautious
for
my
life
is
at
stake
now
how
do
you
propose
to
leave
jerusalem
there
is
no
train
for
damascus
at
dawn
tomorrow
i
am
on
a
diplomatic
mission
answered
grim
the
administration
have
placed
a
car
at
my
disposal
to
take
me
as
far
as
the
border
ah
and
tonight
where
will
you
be
tonight
why
because
i
propose
to
make
a
disclosure
and
ah
you
would
like
to
live
i
take
it
and
not
be
sent
back
to
damascus
in
a
coffin
i
have
ah
some
assistants
who
would
watch
your
movements
if
you
were
to
betray
me
afterwards
to
the
administration
there
would
remain
at
least
the
satisfaction
of
you
understand
me
the
certainty
that
you
would
suffer
for
it
grim
laughed
dryly
i
shall
be
at
the
hotel
he
answered
in
bed
asleep
the
car
comes
before
dawn
that
is
sufficient
i
shall
know
how
to
take
essential
precautions
now
you
think
i
am
a
man
of
words
not
deeds
you
were
near
the
jaffa
gate
this
morning
for
i
saw
you
there
you
saw
a
man
killed
a
policeman
name
bedreddin
that
was
an
unwise
underling
who
stumbled
by
accident
on
a
clue
to
what
i
shall
tell
you
presently
he
had
the
impudence
to
try
to
blackmail
me
me
of
all
people
you
saw
him
killed
but
did
you
see
who
killed
him
i
i
killed
him
with
this
right
hand
you
do
not
believe
you
think
perhaps
i
lack
the
strength
for
such
a
blow
look
here
where
the
force
of
it
broke
my
skin
on
the
handle
of
the
knife
now
am
i
a
man
of
words
not
deeds
you
want
me
to
report
to
mustapha
kemal
that
all
the
accomplishment
in
jerusalem
amounts
to
one
policeman
killed
no
no
you
mistake
my
meaning
my
point
is
that
having
proved
to
you
i
am
a
ruthless
man
of
action
i
am
entitled
to
be
believed
when
i
tell
you
what
next
i
intend
to
do
well
i
listen
there
is
going
to
be
an
explosion
where
when
of
what
in
jerusalem
within
a
day
or
two
and
of
what
why
of
high
explosive
what
else
much
good
an
explosion
in
this
city
will
do
mustapha
kemal
grim
grumbled
you
may
kill
a
few
beggars
and
break
some
windows
the
british
will
double
the
guards
afterward
at
all
the
city
gates
and
that
will
be
the
end
of
it
except
that
some
of
you
who
perhaps
may
escape
being
thrown
into
jail
will
apply
to
mustapha
kemal
for
high
commissions
in
his
army
on
the
strength
of
it
great
doings
mustapha
kemal
will
have
no
bastinadoed
you
are
going
to
be
surprised
what
would
you
say
to
an
explosion
for
instance
that
destroyed
the
dome
of
the
rock
that
might
accomplish
results
you
admit
it
an
explosion
to
be
blamed
on
the
zionists
who
must
afterward
be
protected
by
the
british
from
the
mob
would
that
not
set
india
on
fire
it
might
help
but
who
is
to
do
it
you
see
the
doer
before
you
i
will
do
it
if
i
thought
such
a
thing
was
really
going
to
take
place
you
would
think
that
news
worth
carrying
eh
you
would
hurry
to
damascus
would
you
and
let
me
assure
you
my
dear
captain
speed
is
essential
there
are
reasons
why
the
explosion
has
not
yet
occurred
reasons
of
detail
and
difficulties
to
be
overcome
but
now
there
is
little
further
prospect
of
delay
everything
is
nearly
ready
the
explosive
is
not
yet
in
place
but
is
at
hand
the
authorities
suspect
nothing
there
remains
only
a
little
excavation
work
and
then
nothing
to
do
but
choose
the
hour
when
hundreds
are
in
the
mosque
up
she
goes
does
not
the
idea
appeal
to
you
sensational
very
grim
admitted
ah
but
the
utmost
must
be
made
of
the
sensation
men
must
be
ready
in
damascus
to
stir
public
feeling
on
the
strength
of
it
word
must
go
to
mustapha
kemal
to
strike
hard
while
the
iron
is
hot
there
must
be
reprisals
everywhere
blood
must
flow
the
europeans
french
as
well
as
british
must
be
goaded
into
making
rash
mistakes
that
will
further
inflame
the
populace
it
must
be
shouted
from
the
that
the
jews
have
blown
up
a
moslem
sacred
place
and
that
the
british
are
protecting
them
there
must
be
a
true
proclaimed
against
all
almost
simultaneously
everywhere
do
you
understand
now
how
swiftly
you
must
travel
to
damascus
war
grim
nodded
yet
these
foreigners
are
cunning
he
said
doubtfully
are
you
sure
your
plan
is
not
suspected
quite
sure
there
was
one
man
a
cursed
interfering
jackanapes
of
an
american
whom
they
all
call
jimgrim
of
whom
i
was
afraid
he
is
clever
he
goes
snooping
here
and
there
and
knows
how
to
disguise
himself
but
he
fell
downstairs
this
morning
and
broke
his
thigh
in
two
places
if
anything
could
make
me
religious
that
would
if
i
were
not
a
nationalist
i
would
say
to
god
and
blessed
be
his
prophet
who
has
smitten
him
whom
we
feared
that
broken
leg
might
be
a
trick
to
put
you
off
your
guard
grim
suggested
pleasantly
no
i
made
secret
enquiries
he
is
in
great
pain
he
may
lose
the
leg
the
doctor
who
has
charge
of
the
case
is
a
major
templeton
an
irritable
person
and
like
most
of
the
english
too
big
a
fool
to
deceive
anybody
no
luckily
for
mister
jimgrim
it
is
not
a
trick
otherwise
he
would
have
shared
the
fate
today
of
bedreddin
shah
the
constable
the
trap
was
all
ready
for
him
with
the
inquisitive
and
really
clever
out
of
the
way
there
is
nothing
to
be
feared
now
pardon
me
captain
ali
mirza
but
that
letter
you
received
just
now
would
you
like
to
show
it
to
me
why
grim
demanded
frowning
and
bridling
all
over
for
the
sake
of
reciprocity
i
have
told
you
my
secret
if
it
were
not
that
i
am
more
than
usually
circumspect
and
accustomed
to
protect
myself
one
might
say
that
my
life
is
now
in
your
hands
captain
besides
i
might
add
that
jerusalem
is
my
particular
domain
i
would
have
no
difficulty
in
seeing
that
letter
in
any
case
but
there
should
be
no
need
for
shall
we
call
them
measures
between
friends
i
see
you
are
a
man
of
resource
said
grim
of
great
resource
with
picked
lieutenants
may
i
see
the
letter
now
grim
produced
it
noureddin
ali
took
it
between
spidery
fingers
and
examined
it
like
a
schoolmaster
conning
a
boy
composition
but
the
expression
of
his
face
changed
as
he
took
in
the
contents
holding
the
paper
so
that
could
read
it
too
who
wrote
this
he
asked
ca
you
read
the
signature
enver
eyub
who
is
he
one
of
mustapha
kemal
staff
so
pursuing
your
mission
you
will
also
take
steps
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
noureddin
ali
bey
is
a
person
worthy
of
confidence
aha
that
is
excellent
so
mustapha
kemal
pasha
has
heard
of
me
grim
nodded
and
the
rest
of
your
mission
is
confidential
and
are
you
satisfied
that
i
am
to
be
trusted
i
think
you
mean
business
then
you
should
tell
me
what
is
the
nature
of
your
secret
mission
to
jerusalem
possibly
i
can
give
you
needed
information
if
you
have
obtained
information
of
value
you
should
confide
in
me
i
can
be
most
useful
when
i
know
most
grim
frowned
he
began
to
look
uneasy
and
the
more
he
did
that
the
more
delight
noureddin
ali
seemed
to
take
in
questioning
him
but
be
pleaded
his
own
case
too
the
trouble
with
the
nationalist
movement
he
insisted
is
lack
of
unity
there
is
no
mutual
confidence
consequently
no
combination
there
are
too
many
intellects
working
at
cross
purposes
you
should
tell
me
what
is
being
done
so
that
i
may
fit
in
my
plans
accordingly
when
the
dome
of
the
rock
has
been
blown
up
there
will
be
ample
opportunity
for
putting
into
execution
a
combined
plan
you
must
confide
in
me
suppose
i
get
rid
of
that
messenger
and
the
boy
first
grim
suggested
grim
felt
in
his
pocket
and
produced
a
purse
full
of
bank
notes
but
they
were
all
big
ones
never
mind
i
have
change
said
noureddin
ali
how
much
will
you
give
him
no
said
grim
the
boy
can
take
him
to
the
hotel
let
him
wait
for
me
there
he
has
no
further
business
here
he
should
return
to
damascus
he
had
better
travel
with
me
in
the
car
tomorrow
morning
take
him
to
the
hotel
and
wait
for
me
there
you
he
added
in
arabic
to
suliman
yussuf
came
and
opened
the
door
suliman
took
my
hand
and
led
me
out
the
door
slammed
shut
behind
me
and
a
great
sikh
leaning
on
his
rifle
at
a
corner
thirty
feet
away
came
to
life
just
sufficiently
to
follow
me
with
curious
brown
eyes
that
is
narayan
singh
announced
suliman
when
we
had
passed
him
he
is
jimgrim
friend
there
was
another
sikh
just
in
sight
of
him
at
the
next
corner
and
another
beyond
him
again
all
looking
rather
bored
but
awfully
capable
none
except
the
first
one
took
the
slightest
notice
of
us
it
was
some
consolation
to
know
that
jimgrim
friend
was
on
guard
outside
yussuf
i
had
no
means
of
knowing
what
weapons
grim
carried
if
any
but
was
positive
of
one
thing
if
either
noureddin
ali
or
the
man
with
alligator
eyes
should
get
an
inkling
of
his
real
identity
his
life
would
not
be
worth
ten
minutes
purchase
including
yussuf
who
would
likely
do
as
he
was
told
there
would
be
three
to
one
between
those
silent
walls
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
narayan
singh
might
as
well
be
three
miles
away
as
thirty
feet
however
there
was
nothing
i
could
do
about
it
it
was
late
afternoon
already
and
the
crowd
was
swarming
all
one
way
the
women
carrying
the
baskets
and
the
men
lording
it
near
enough
to
keep
an
eye
on
them
if
suliman
and
i
were
followed
whoever
had
that
job
had
his
work
cut
out
for
we
were
swallowed
up
in
a
noisy
stream
of
villagers
whose
baskets
and
other
burdens
made
an
effectual
screen
behind
us
as
well
as
in
front
the
hotel
stands
close
by
the
jaffa
gate
and
there
the
crowd
was
densest
for
the
outgoing
swarm
was
met
by
another
tide
of
folk
returning
in
the
mouth
of
the
hotel
arcade
stood
an
officer
whom
i
knew
well
enough
by
sight
colonel
goodenough
commander
of
the
sikhs
a
quiet
gray
little
man
with
a
monocle
and
that
air
of
knowing
his
own
mind
that
is
the
real
key
to
control
of
indian
troops
up
a
there
were
a
dozen
standing
and
a
british
subaltern
was
making
himself
as
inconspicuous
as
he
could
in
the
doorway
of
a
store
it
did
not
need
much
discernment
to
judge
that
those
in
authority
were
ready
to
deal
swiftly
with
any
kind
of
trouble
but
the
only
glimpse
i
had
of
any
stirring
was
when
three
obvious
zionist
jews
were
rather
roughly
hustled
by
some
hebron
men
who
pride
themselves
on
their
willingness
to
brawl
with
any
one
two
sikhs
interfered
at
once
and
goodenough
who
was
watching
never
batted
an
eyelash
i
was
tired
wanted
a
whiskey
and
soda
and
a
bath
more
than
anything
else
i
could
imagine
at
the
moment
i
was
eager
to
get
to
my
room
in
the
hotel
suliman
being
not
much
more
than
a
baby
after
all
wanted
to
go
to
sleep
we
went
past
goodenough
who
eyed
me
sharply
but
took
no
further
notice
and
we
entered
the
hotel
door
but
there
we
were
met
by
cerberus
in
the
shape
of
an
arab
porter
who
cursed
our
religion
and
ordered
us
out
again
threatening
violence
if
we
did
not
make
haste
suliman
argued
with
him
in
vain
and
even
whimpered
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
return
to
the
arcade
where
i
sat
down
on
a
step
from
which
a
native
policeman
drove
me
away
officiously
i
had
about
made
up
my
mind
to
go
and
speak
to
goodenough
in
english
when
grim
appeared
not
even
goodenough
recognized
him
his
syrian
stride
was
so
well
acted
he
saluted
and
the
salute
was
returned
punctiliously
but
with
that
reserve
toward
a
foreigner
that
the
englishman
puts
on
unconsciously
when
grim
spoke
to
him
in
arabic
goodenough
answered
in
the
same
language
i
did
not
hear
what
was
said
at
first
but
as
i
drew
closer
i
heard
the
sequel
for
grim
changed
suddenly
to
english
if
you
ca
recognize
me
through
that
of
yours
colonel
i
must
be
one
leopard
who
can
really
change
his
spots
i
grim
do
change
your
expression
quick
look
around
and
tell
me
if
i
followed
hard
to
say
such
a
crowd
here
there
a
syrian
over
the
way
with
a
bulbous
nose
who
came
along
after
you
he
leaning
with
his
back
to
the
wall
now
watching
us
he
the
boy
i
see
narayan
singh
has
left
his
post
did
you
give
him
orders
yes
told
him
to
follow
any
one
who
followed
me
i
do
want
that
fellow
interfered
with
he
may
stay
there
or
more
likely
he
call
others
to
take
his
place
they
watch
all
night
if
they
allowed
to
let
them
wish
you
give
orders
they
to
be
left
alone
then
please
let
narayan
singh
go
off
duty
and
get
some
sleep
i
going
to
want
him
all
day
tomorrow
all
right
grim
anything
else
first
opportunity
i
wish
you
come
to
davey
room
upstairs
now
long
distance
stuff
again
sir
if
any
syrian
asks
you
about
me
you
might
say
i
was
making
sure
the
car
would
come
for
me
at
dawn
they
exchanged
salutes
again
as
one
suspicious
alien
to
another
grim
looked
suitably
surprised
at
sight
of
me
and
led
me
and
suliman
back
to
the
hotel
where
suliman
wanted
him
to
wreak
dire
vengeance
on
the
porter
he
grew
sulky
when
he
discovered
that
his
influence
with
grim
was
not
sufficient
for
the
purpose
but
forgot
it
small
boy
fashion
ten
minutes
later
when
he
fell
asleep
on
the
floor
in
a
corner
of
davey
room
davey
did
not
look
exactly
pleased
to
see
us
although
he
seemed
to
like
grim
personally
and
was
the
first
that
day
to
see
through
grim
disguise
at
the
first
glance
davey
on
the
other
hand
was
radiant
with
smiles
thrilled
at
the
prospect
of
learning
secrets
she
produced
drinks
and
pushed
the
armchairs
up
when
she
learned
who
i
was
her
husband
could
hardly
keep
her
from
putting
on
a
costume
too
to
make
a
party
of
it
davey
was
reserved
he
asked
no
questions
a
eyed
stocky
man
who
had
made
impossibilities
come
true
on
three
continents
he
waited
for
trouble
to
come
to
him
instead
of
seeking
it
there
was
silence
for
several
minutes
over
the
cigars
and
whiskey
before
grim
opened
fire
at
last
he
talked
straight
out
in
front
of
davey
for
she
had
mothered
cosmopolitan
oil
men
in
a
hundred
places
she
knew
more
sacred
secrets
than
the
sphinx
any
news
about
your
oil
concessions
davey
no
not
a
word
we
got
every
prospect
in
the
country
marked
out
nothing
to
do
now
but
wait
for
the
mandate
while
the
zionists
go
behind
our
backs
to
the
foreign
office
and
scheme
for
the
concessions
it
my
belief
the
british
mean
to
favor
the
zionists
and
put
us
in
the
ditch
the
fact
that
we
were
first
on
the
ground
and
lodged
our
applications
with
the
turks
before
the
war
seems
to
make
no
difference
in
their
lives
well
old
man
i
arranged
for
you
to
change
your
policy
said
grim
what
in
thunder
do
you
mean
davey
giggled
with
delight
but
her
husband
frowned
ominously
i
supposed
to
be
ali
mirza
of
the
shereefian
army
i
heard
of
him
he
a
bad
one
jim
he
is
one
of
those
syrian
arabs
who
will
accept
any
one
money
but
who
never
stays
bought
why
masquerade
as
a
scoundrel
i
was
in
a
place
just
now
with
a
bunch
of
murderers
who
have
made
short
work
of
me
if
i
could
give
them
a
sound
reason
for
being
in
jerusalem
just
now
why
not
have
all
arrested
for
the
same
reason
davey
that
your
oil
company
is
piping
ten
thousand
barrels
a
day
from
jericho
the
time
is
not
yet
things
have
reached
that
stage
i
told
them
your
oil
company
gave
up
hope
long
ago
of
getting
a
concession
from
the
british
and
has
decided
to
finance
mustapha
kemal
davey
flung
his
cigar
out
of
the
window
and
laid
both
hands
on
his
knees
his
face
was
a
picture
of
baffled
indignation
but
his
wife
laughed
they
were
tickled
to
death
grim
continued
i
supposed
to
be
going
to
damascus
tomorrow
morning
with
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
in
gold
obtained
from
you
in
ten
small
bags
got
to
find
some
bags
and
pack
them
full
of
something
heavy
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
davey
exploded
at
last
a
damned
outrage
why
this
tale
will
be
all
over
the
place
the
jews
will
get
hold
of
it
and
make
complaints
in
london
next
you
know
the
state
department
will
be
raising
blue
hell
questions
asked
in
congress
headlines
in
all
the
papers
what
do
you
suppose
our
people
will
think
of
me
refer
them
to
your
wife
davey
she
got
you
out
of
much
worse
messes
i
drive
the
car
straight
up
to
oeta
and
lodge
my
protest
against
this
in
less
than
fifteen
minutes
no
need
davey
old
man
goodenough
will
be
in
here
presently
kick
to
him
davey
went
into
the
next
room
and
returned
with
a
roll
of
coarse
cotton
cloth
i
no
bags
jim
but
if
this
stuff
will
do
i
can
sew
some
right
now
good
enough
emily
go
to
it
want
to
lose
me
my
job
demanded
davey
but
his
wife
took
up
the
scissors
and
smiled
back
at
him
you
know
better
than
that
we
trusted
jim
before
listen
davey
this
thing
serious
said
grim
i
know
it
is
so
i
nothing
doing
you
on
the
inside
of
an
official
secret
curse
all
official
secrets
my
business
is
oil
there
be
no
oil
in
this
man
land
for
any
one
for
fifty
years
if
you
wo
play
there
be
a
jihad
instead
planning
to
blow
up
the
dome
of
the
rock
straight
goods
davey
two
tons
of
tnt
stolen
and
our
friend
scharnhoff
the
austrian
hunting
for
the
tomb
of
the
kings
digging
for
it
day
and
night
conspirators
waiting
to
run
in
the
explosive
as
soon
as
the
tunnel
is
complete
why
not
arrest
at
once
we
want
to
catch
the
principals
explosive
and
all
we
do
know
where
the
explosive
is
yet
bag
the
lot
and
kill
the
story
otherwise
see
what
it
means
if
the
news
leaks
out
they
blame
the
attempt
on
the
jews
and
the
minute
the
british
protect
the
jews
there
be
all
moslem
asia
on
fire
get
me
get
you
yes
i
get
you
i
get
hell
from
the
home
office
though
for
meddling
in
politics
goodenough
came
in
then
rather
a
different
man
from
the
stern
little
martinet
who
had
stood
in
the
throat
of
the
arcade
he
was
all
smiles
evening
davey
he
said
genially
that
one
man
went
away
grim
and
three
took
his
place
they
sha
be
disturbed
narayan
singh
has
gone
off
duty
now
davey
i
been
told
that
americans
all
went
dry
on
account
of
a
new
religion
called
the
volstead
act
mean
to
say
you
tempt
a
thirsty
soldier
with
a
dry
martini
chapter
sixteen
the
enemy
is
nearly
always
useful
if
you
leave
him
free
to
make
mistakes
the
next
item
on
the
program
was
to
awaken
suliman
he
did
not
want
to
wake
up
he
had
lost
all
interest
in
secret
service
for
the
time
being
even
the
sight
of
davey
new
york
candy
did
not
stir
enthusiasm
he
declared
it
was
stuff
fit
for
bints
not
men
all
right
then
grim
announced
at
last
school
for
you
and
i
get
another
that
settled
it
the
boy
on
whose
lips
the
word
dog
was
a
foul
epithet
was
actually
proud
to
share
a
bedroom
with
julius
caesar
the
mess
school
where
there
would
be
other
iniquitous
small
boys
to
be
led
into
trouble
had
no
particular
terrors
but
to
lose
his
job
and
to
see
another
boy
perhaps
a
jew
or
a
christian
become
jimgrim
was
outside
the
pale
of
inflictions
that
pride
could
tolerate
i
am
awake
he
retorted
rubbing
his
eyes
to
prove
it
come
here
then
know
where
to
find
your
mother
at
the
place
where
i
went
yesterday
take
her
some
of
davey
candy
do
eat
it
on
the
way
mind
get
inside
the
place
if
you
can
if
she
wo
let
you
in
try
how
much
you
can
see
through
the
door
ask
no
questions
if
she
asks
what
you
been
doing
tell
her
the
truth
say
that
you
cleaned
my
boots
and
washed
julius
caesar
then
come
back
here
and
tell
me
all
you
seen
sending
him
to
spy
on
his
own
mother
jim
asked
davey
as
suliman
left
the
room
with
candy
in
both
fists
she
paused
from
stitching
at
the
cotton
bags
to
look
straight
at
grim
his
mother
is
old
scharnhoff
housekeeper
grim
answered
scharnhoff
would
stand
for
the
boy
and
drove
him
out
the
mother
liked
scharnhoff
better
than
the
prospects
of
the
streets
so
she
stayed
on
swiping
stuff
from
larder
now
and
then
to
slip
to
the
kid
through
the
back
door
but
he
was
starving
when
i
found
him
davey
laid
her
sewing
down
mean
to
tell
me
that
that
old
professor
is
that
child
father
no
the
father
was
a
turkish
soldier
went
away
with
the
turkish
retreat
if
he
alive
he
probably
with
mustapha
kemal
in
anatolia
old
scharnhoff
used
to
keep
a
regular
harem
under
the
turks
he
got
rid
of
them
to
save
his
face
when
our
crowd
took
jerusalem
he
puts
up
with
one
now
but
he
has
the
turk
idea
of
married
life
and
to
think
i
had
him
here
to
tea
twice
no
three
times
i
liked
him
too
found
him
interesting
he
is
said
grim
very
agreed
goodenough
if
it
were
for
that
harem
habit
of
his
said
grim
some
acquaintances
of
his
would
have
blown
up
the
dome
of
the
rock
about
this
time
tomorrow
as
it
is
they
wo
get
away
with
it
suliman
came
and
told
me
one
day
that
his
mother
was
carrying
food
to
scharnhoff
taking
it
to
a
little
house
in
a
street
that
runs
below
the
i
looked
into
that
then
came
news
that
two
tons
of
tnt
was
missing
on
top
of
a
request
from
scharnhoff
for
permission
to
go
about
at
night
unquestioned
after
that
it
was
only
a
question
of
putting
two
and
two
together
plus
narayan
singh
said
goodenough
i
still
do
see
grim
how
you
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
scharnhoff
is
not
guilty
of
the
main
intention
what
to
prove
that
he
is
in
the
pay
of
mustapha
kemal
i
explain
all
scharnhoff
cares
about
is
some
manuscripts
he
thinks
he
find
he
thinks
he
knows
where
they
are
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
israel
i
expect
he
tried
pretty
hard
to
get
the
turks
to
let
him
excavate
for
them
but
the
turks
knew
better
than
to
offend
religious
prejudices
and
perhaps
scharnhoff
could
afford
to
bribe
heavily
enough
his
harem
very
likely
kept
him
rather
short
of
money
then
we
come
along
and
stop
all
excavation
cancel
all
permits
refuse
to
grant
new
ones
scharnhoff
problem
is
to
dig
without
calling
attention
to
what
he
doing
as
a
technical
enemy
alien
he
ca
acquire
property
or
even
rent
property
without
permission
but
with
the
aid
of
suliman
mother
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
our
friend
noureddin
ali
who
has
a
friend
who
in
turn
has
a
brother
who
owns
a
little
house
in
that
street
below
the
strange
coincidence
said
goodenough
it
need
a
better
argument
than
that
to
save
scharnhoff
neck
pardon
me
sir
no
coincidence
at
all
remember
scharnhoff
has
lived
in
jerusalem
for
fifteen
years
he
seems
to
have
satisfied
himself
that
the
tomb
of
the
kings
is
directly
under
the
dome
of
the
rock
how
is
he
to
get
to
it
the
dome
of
the
rock
stands
in
the
middle
of
that
great
courtyard
with
the
buildings
of
the
surrounding
it
on
every
side
and
hardly
a
stone
in
the
foundations
weighing
less
than
ten
tons
he
reasons
it
out
that
there
must
be
a
tunnel
somewhere
leading
to
the
tomb
if
it
really
is
under
the
dome
of
the
rock
i
have
found
out
that
he
went
to
work
while
the
turks
were
still
here
to
find
the
mouth
of
the
tunnel
remember
he
an
archaeologist
there
very
little
he
does
know
about
jerusalem
he
knows
who
the
owner
is
of
every
bit
of
property
surrounding
the
he
made
it
his
business
to
find
out
so
when
he
finally
decided
that
this
little
stone
house
stands
over
the
mouth
of
the
tunnel
all
that
remained
to
do
was
to
get
access
to
it
he
could
do
that
himself
because
of
the
regulations
he
had
to
approach
the
arab
owner
secretly
and
indirectly
that
where
suliman
mother
came
in
handy
she
contrived
the
introduction
to
noureddin
ali
innocent
old
scharnhoff
who
is
an
honest
thief
he
would
steal
money
sacrilege
is
scharnhoff
passion
was
an
easy
mark
for
noureddin
ali
noureddin
ali
is
a
devil
so
smart
at
seeing
possibilities
that
he
is
blind
to
probabilities
he
is
paid
by
the
french
to
make
trouble
and
he
the
world
i
do
believe
the
french
have
any
hand
in
this
job
scharnhoff
needed
explosives
noureddin
ali
saw
at
once
that
if
that
tunnel
can
be
found
and
opened
up
there
could
be
an
atrocity
perpetrated
that
would
produce
anarchy
all
through
the
east
as
bad
as
all
that
asked
davey
that
no
exaggeration
goodenough
answered
i
lived
years
in
india
commanding
sikh
and
moslem
troops
the
sikhs
are
not
interested
in
the
moslem
religion
in
any
way
but
they
make
common
cause
with
moslems
if
that
place
were
blown
up
and
the
blame
could
be
attached
to
jews
it
the
second
most
sacred
place
in
asia
even
the
hindus
would
be
stirred
to
their
depths
by
it
they
feel
that
their
own
sacred
places
were
insecure
and
that
whoever
destroyed
them
would
be
protected
afterwards
by
us
gosh
who
be
an
englishman
laughed
davey
i
do
see
that
it
proved
yet
that
the
idea
of
an
explosion
was
sharnhoff
in
the
first
place
goodenough
objected
for
one
thing
he
would
want
to
destroy
antiquities
said
grim
they
his
obsession
he
worships
ancient
history
and
all
its
monuments
no
noureddin
ali
thought
of
the
explosion
he
knew
that
scharnhoff
needed
money
so
he
gave
him
french
money
knowing
that
would
put
old
scharnhoff
completely
in
his
power
then
he
tipped
off
some
one
down
at
ludd
to
watch
for
a
chance
to
steal
some
tnt
he
had
better
luck
than
he
expected
he
got
two
tons
of
it
he
did
have
all
the
luck
though
his
plan
i
believe
was
to
time
the
fireworks
simultaneously
with
a
raid
from
but
the
raid
did
come
off
scharnhoff
will
hang
said
goodenough
i
think
not
sir
he
prove
as
meek
as
an
old
sheep
when
we
land
on
him
there
will
the
bags
do
asked
davey
what
are
they
for
goodenough
asked
we
supposed
to
have
a
slush
fund
in
this
room
of
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
davey
answered
dourly
my
oil
company
is
supposed
to
be
buying
up
mustapha
kemal
i
see
my
finish
if
news
of
this
ever
reaches
the
states
or
unless
my
version
of
it
gets
there
first
grim
turned
to
me
we
got
to
find
two
people
to
take
your
place
and
mine
in
the
car
tomorrow
morning
perhaps
you
better
go
in
any
case
you
enjoy
the
ride
as
far
as
haifa
stay
there
a
day
or
two
and
come
back
when
you
feel
like
it
we
find
some
officer
to
masquerade
as
me
but
there
i
rebelled
flat
downright
mutiny
if
i
have
made
good
so
far
i
said
i
consider
myself
fired
and
hold
my
tongue
otherwise
i
see
this
thing
through
send
some
one
else
on
the
good
for
you
said
davey
dammit
man
said
goodenough
staring
at
me
through
his
monocle
the
rest
of
us
get
paid
for
taking
chances
the
only
tangible
reward
you
can
possibly
get
will
be
a
knife
in
your
back
better
be
sensible
and
take
the
ride
to
haifa
my
bet
is
down
said
i
good
grim
nodded
it
goes
all
the
same
you
get
a
ride
ca
take
too
many
chances
tell
you
about
that
later
meanwhile
will
you
detail
an
officer
to
come
and
spend
the
night
in
this
hotel
and
masquerade
as
me
at
dawn
sir
he
can
wear
this
uniform
that
i
got
on
somebody
about
my
height
turner
will
do
that
what
are
you
going
to
put
in
the
bags
asked
goodenough
cartridges
they
heavy
you
might
tell
turner
over
the
phone
to
bring
them
with
him
at
that
point
suliman
returned
sooner
than
expected
with
news
that
made
grim
whistle
suliman
had
not
been
inside
the
place
where
his
mother
was
she
would
not
let
him
but
he
had
seen
around
her
skirts
as
she
stood
in
the
partly
opened
door
there
was
a
hole
in
the
floor
said
suliman
and
a
great
stone
laid
beside
it
also
much
gray
dust
and
i
think
there
was
a
light
a
long
way
down
in
the
hole
but
that
was
not
what
made
grim
whistle
what
else
did
your
mother
say
anything
she
was
that
scharnhoff
had
beaten
her
i
knew
he
make
a
bad
break
sooner
or
later
what
did
he
beat
her
for
because
she
was
afraid
that
a
fine
reason
afraid
of
what
he
says
she
is
to
sell
oranges
four
wooden
benches
have
been
brought
and
tomorrow
they
are
to
be
set
outside
the
door
in
the
street
oranges
and
raisins
have
been
bought
and
she
is
to
sit
outside
the
door
and
sell
them
she
is
afraid
fruit
bought
already
ca
be
was
it
inside
there
no
it
is
to
come
tomorrow
she
says
she
does
not
know
how
to
sell
fruit
and
is
afraid
of
the
police
grim
and
goodenough
exchanged
glances
she
says
that
if
the
police
come
everybody
will
be
killed
and
that
i
am
to
keep
watch
in
the
street
in
the
morning
and
give
warning
of
the
police
that
should
teach
you
young
man
never
to
take
a
woman
into
your
confidence
eh
mrs
davey
said
goodenough
we
certainly
the
sex
she
answered
piling
the
finished
bags
one
on
top
of
the
other
on
the
table
grim
took
me
after
that
to
the
hotel
roof
whence
you
can
see
the
whole
of
jerusalem
it
was
just
before
moonrise
the
ancient
city
lay
in
shadow
with
the
dome
of
the
rock
looming
above
it
mysterious
and
silent
down
below
us
in
the
street
where
a
gasoline
light
threw
a
glare
three
arabs
in
native
costume
were
squatting
with
their
backs
against
the
low
wall
facing
the
hotel
noureddin
ali
men
said
grim
chuckling
they
help
us
to
prove
our
alibi
the
enemy
is
nearly
always
useful
if
you
leave
him
free
to
make
mistakes
you
may
have
to
spend
the
whole
night
in
the
mosque
you
and
suliman
i
take
you
there
presently
two
of
those
men
are
pretty
sure
to
follow
us
one
will
probably
follow
me
back
here
again
the
other
will
stay
to
keep
an
eye
on
you
about
an
hour
before
dawn
in
case
nothing
happens
before
that
you
and
suliman
come
back
here
to
the
hotel
the
car
shall
be
here
before
daylight
you
and
turner
pile
into
it
and
those
three
men
watch
you
drive
away
they
hurry
off
to
tell
noureddin
ali
that
ali
mirza
and
the
man
have
really
started
for
damascus
bags
of
gold
and
all
turner
must
remember
to
drop
a
couple
of
bags
and
pick
them
up
again
to
call
attention
to
them
there
be
a
change
of
clothes
in
the
car
for
you
when
you
gone
a
mile
or
so
get
into
the
other
clothes
and
walk
back
if
i
do
meet
you
by
the
jaffa
gate
suliman
will
or
else
narayan
singh
things
are
liable
to
happen
pretty
fast
tomorrow
morning
let
go
i
supposed
to
have
found
out
somehow
that
you
awful
religious
and
want
to
pray
so
it
the
dome
of
the
rock
for
yours
any
moslem
who
wants
to
may
sleep
there
you
know
but
any
christian
caught
kidding
them
he
a
moslem
would
be
for
it
short
shrift
he
be
dead
before
the
sheikh
of
the
place
could
hand
him
over
to
the
authorities
if
the
tnt
were
really
in
place
underneath
you
which
i
pretty
sure
it
wo
be
for
a
few
hours
yet
that
would
be
lots
safer
than
the
other
chance
taking
so
peel
your
wits
let
suliman
sleep
if
he
wants
to
but
you
have
to
keep
awake
all
night
but
what
am
i
to
do
in
there
what
likely
to
happen
just
listen
the
tunnel
is
through
to
the
end
yet
i
sure
of
it
if
it
were
they
have
taken
in
the
tnt
for
it
must
be
ticklish
work
keeping
it
hidden
elsewhere
with
scores
of
sikhs
watching
day
and
night
but
they
very
near
the
end
of
the
tunnel
or
they
would
be
opening
up
that
fruit
stand
hear
them
break
through
when
you
absolutely
sure
of
that
come
out
of
the
mosque
and
say
atcha
just
that
one
word
to
the
sikh
sentry
you
see
standing
under
the
archway
through
which
we
enter
the
courtyard
presently
that
sentry
will
be
narayan
singh
and
he
know
what
to
do
what
shall
i
do
after
that
suit
yourself
either
return
to
the
mosque
and
go
to
sleep
if
you
can
trust
yourself
to
wake
in
time
or
come
and
sit
on
the
hotel
step
until
morning
have
you
got
it
all
clear
it
a
piece
of
good
luck
having
you
to
do
all
this
no
real
moslem
would
ever
be
able
to
hold
his
tongue
about
it
superstitious
about
the
dome
of
the
rock
but
ask
questions
now
if
you
not
clear
you
must
be
seen
speaking
in
the
street
or
in
the
mosque
remember
all
plain
sailing
come
along
then
if
you
alive
tomorrow
you
have
had
an
adventure
chapter
seventeen
poor
old
scharnhoff
in
the
soup
we
ate
a
scratch
dinner
with
the
daveys
in
their
room
and
started
forth
grim
as
usual
had
his
nerve
with
him
he
led
me
and
suliman
straight
up
to
the
three
spies
who
were
squatting
against
the
wall
and
asked
whether
there
were
any
special
regulations
that
would
prevent
my
being
left
for
the
night
in
the
famous
mosque
on
top
of
that
he
asked
one
of
the
men
to
show
him
the
shortest
way
so
two
of
them
elected
to
come
with
us
walking
just
ahead
and
the
third
man
stayed
where
he
was
presumably
in
case
noureddin
ali
should
send
to
make
enquiries
you
must
walk
through
jerusalem
by
night
with
the
moon
just
rising
if
you
want
really
to
get
the
glamour
of
eastern
tales
and
understand
how
true
to
life
those
stories
are
of
old
it
is
almost
the
only
city
left
with
its
ancient
walls
all
standing
with
its
ancient
streets
intact
at
that
time
in
there
was
nothing
whatever
new
to
mar
the
setting
no
new
buildings
the
city
was
only
cleaner
than
it
was
under
the
turks
parts
of
the
narrow
thoroughfares
are
roofed
over
with
vaulted
arches
the
domed
roofs
rise
in
unplanned
beautiful
disorder
against
a
sky
luminous
with
jewels
to
right
and
left
you
can
look
through
arches
down
shadowy
narrow
ways
to
carved
doors
through
which
knights
templar
used
to
swagger
with
gold
spurs
and
that
saladin
men
appropriated
after
them
yellow
lamplight
shining
from
small
windows
set
deep
in
the
massive
walls
casts
an
occasional
band
of
pure
gold
across
the
storied
gloom
now
and
then
a
man
steps
out
from
a
doorway
his
identity
concealed
by
flowing
eastern
finery
pauses
for
a
moment
in
the
light
to
look
about
him
and
disappears
into
silent
mystery
doors
at
intervals
give
glimpses
of
white
interiors
and
of
men
from
a
hundred
deserts
sitting
on
mats
to
smoke
great
and
talk
intrigue
there
are
smells
that
are
stagnant
with
the
rot
of
time
other
smells
pungent
with
spice
and
mystery
and
the
alluring
scent
of
bales
of
merchandise
that
like
the
mew
of
gulls
can
set
the
mind
traveling
to
lands
unseen
through
other
arched
doors
even
at
night
there
is
a
glimpse
of
blindfold
camels
going
round
and
round
in
ancient
gloom
at
the
there
are
no
sounds
of
revelry
the
arab
takes
his
pleasures
stately
fashion
and
the
jew
has
learned
from
history
that
the
safest
way
to
enjoy
life
is
to
keep
quiet
about
it
now
and
then
you
can
hear
an
arab
singing
a
desert
song
not
very
musical
but
utterly
descriptive
of
the
life
he
leads
we
caught
the
sound
of
a
flute
played
wistfully
in
an
upper
room
by
some
jew
returned
from
the
west
to
take
up
anew
the
thread
of
ancient
history
grim
nudged
me
sharply
in
one
shadowy
place
where
the
street
went
down
in
steps
between
the
high
walls
of
windowless
harems
another
narrow
street
crossed
ours
thirty
feet
ahead
of
us
and
our
two
guides
were
hurrying
only
glancing
back
at
intervals
to
make
sure
we
had
not
given
them
the
slip
the
was
between
us
and
them
and
as
grim
nudged
me
two
men
a
bulky
bearded
big
one
and
one
of
rather
less
than
middle
height
both
in
arab
dress
passed
in
front
of
us
there
was
no
chance
of
being
overheard
and
grim
spoke
in
a
low
voice
do
you
recognize
them
i
shook
my
head
scharnhoff
and
noureddin
ali
i
do
see
now
how
he
recognized
them
but
i
suppose
a
man
who
works
long
enough
at
grim
business
acquires
a
sixth
sense
they
were
walking
swiftly
arguing
in
low
tones
much
too
busy
with
their
own
affairs
to
pay
attention
to
us
our
two
guides
glanced
back
a
moment
later
but
they
had
vanished
by
then
into
the
gloom
of
the
there
was
a
dim
lamp
at
one
corner
of
that
crossing
as
we
passed
through
its
pale
circle
of
light
i
noticed
a
man
who
looked
like
an
arab
lurking
in
the
shadow
just
beyond
it
i
thought
he
made
a
sign
to
grim
but
i
did
not
see
grim
return
it
grim
watched
his
chance
then
spoke
again
that
man
in
the
shadow
is
a
sikh
narayan
singh
sidekick
keeping
tabs
on
scharnhoff
i
bet
old
scharnhoff
has
cold
feet
and
went
to
find
noureddin
ali
to
try
and
talk
him
out
of
it
might
as
well
try
to
a
away
from
a
yard
poor
old
scharnhoff
in
the
soup
quite
suddenly
after
that
we
reached
a
fairly
wide
street
and
the
arched
byzantine
gateway
of
the
through
which
we
could
see
tall
cypress
trees
against
the
moonlit
sky
and
the
dome
of
the
mosque
beyond
them
they
do
say
the
taj
mahal
at
agra
is
a
lovelier
sight
and
more
inspiring
but
perhaps
that
is
because
the
taj
is
farther
away
from
the
folk
who
like
to
have
opinions
at
age
history
situation
setting
sanctity
the
dome
of
the
rock
has
the
advantage
of
all
those
and
the
purple
sky
crowded
with
coloured
stars
beyond
it
is
more
wonderful
over
jerusalem
because
of
the
clearness
of
the
mountain
air
in
that
minute
and
for
the
first
time
i
hated
the
men
who
could
plot
to
blow
up
that
place
hitherto
i
had
been
merely
interested
because
it
was
long
after
the
hour
when
visitors
are
allowed
to
go
about
the
place
with
guides
we
were
submitted
to
rather
careful
scrutiny
by
men
who
came
out
of
the
shadows
and
said
nothing
but
peered
into
our
faces
they
did
not
speak
to
let
us
by
but
signified
admittance
by
turning
uninterested
backs
and
retiring
to
some
dark
corners
to
resume
the
vigil
i
thought
that
the
sikh
sentry
who
stood
with
bayonet
fixed
outside
the
arch
looked
at
grim
with
something
more
than
curiosity
but
no
sign
that
i
could
detect
passed
between
them
the
great
white
moonlit
courtyard
was
empty
not
a
soul
stirred
in
it
not
a
shadow
moved
because
of
the
hour
there
were
not
even
any
guides
lurking
around
the
mosque
the
only
shape
that
came
to
life
as
we
approached
the
main
entrance
of
the
mosque
was
the
man
who
takes
care
of
the
slippers
for
a
small
fee
grim
since
he
was
in
military
dress
allowed
the
attendant
to
tie
on
over
his
shoes
the
great
straw
slippers
they
keep
there
for
that
purpose
suliman
had
nothing
on
his
feet
i
kicked
off
the
red
damascus
slippers
i
was
wearing
and
we
entered
the
octagonal
building
by
passing
under
a
curtain
at
the
rear
of
the
deep
vaulted
entrance
nobody
took
any
notice
of
us
at
first
it
was
difficult
to
see
for
one
thing
the
light
of
the
lamps
that
hung
on
chains
from
the
arches
overhead
was
dimmed
by
coloured
lenses
and
did
little
more
than
beautify
the
gloom
but
in
the
dimness
in
the
midst
you
could
see
the
rock
of
abraham
surrounded
by
a
railing
to
preserve
it
from
profane
feet
little
by
little
the
shadows
took
shape
of
men
praying
or
sleeping
or
conversing
in
low
tones
the
place
was
not
crowded
there
were
perhaps
a
hundred
men
in
there
some
of
whom
doubtless
intended
to
spend
the
night
all
of
them
though
they
gave
us
a
cursory
glance
seemed
disposed
to
mind
their
own
business
it
looked
for
a
minute
as
if
we
were
going
to
remain
in
there
unquestioned
but
the
two
spies
who
had
come
with
us
saw
a
chance
to
confirm
or
else
disprove
our
bona
fides
and
while
one
of
them
stayed
and
watched
us
the
other
went
to
fetch
the
sheikh
of
the
mosque
he
came
presently
waddling
very
actively
for
such
a
stout
man
a
big
burly
intellectual
with
eyes
that
beamed
intelligent
through
glasses
he
did
not
seem
at
all
pleased
to
have
been
disturbed
until
he
drew
near
enough
to
scan
our
faces
then
his
change
of
expression
as
soon
as
he
had
looked
once
into
grim
eyes
gave
me
cold
chills
all
down
the
back
i
could
have
sworn
he
was
going
to
denounce
us
instead
he
turned
on
the
two
spies
he
them
in
arabic
i
could
not
follow
it
word
for
word
i
gathered
that
they
had
hinted
some
suspicion
as
to
the
genuineness
of
pretension
to
be
ali
mirza
he
was
rebuking
them
for
it
they
slunk
away
one
went
and
sat
near
the
door
we
had
entered
by
the
other
vanished
completely
jimgrim
what
do
you
do
here
at
this
hour
asked
the
sheikh
as
soon
as
we
stood
alone
talk
french
grim
answered
we
ca
afford
to
be
overheard
true
o
jimgrim
it
is
all
your
life
and
my
position
is
worth
for
you
to
be
detected
in
here
in
that
disguise
at
such
an
hour
and
who
are
these
with
you
it
is
all
your
life
and
mosque
are
worth
to
turn
us
out
grim
answered
when
was
i
ever
your
enemy
never
yet
but
what
does
this
mean
you
shall
know
in
the
morning
you
alone
this
man
who
can
neither
hear
nor
speak
and
the
child
with
him
must
stay
in
here
tonight
and
go
when
they
choose
unquestioned
jimgrim
this
is
not
a
place
for
setting
traps
for
criminals
set
your
watch
outside
and
none
shall
interfere
with
you
the
heart
within
be
cleansed
by
washing
hands
grim
quoted
and
the
shiekh
smiled
do
you
mean
there
are
criminals
within
the
mosque
if
so
this
is
sanctuary
jimgrim
they
shall
not
be
disturbed
set
watchmen
at
the
doors
and
catch
them
as
they
leave
if
you
will
this
is
holy
ground
there
be
none
of
it
left
to
boast
about
this
time
tomorrow
if
you
choose
to
insist
grim
answered
should
there
be
riddles
between
you
and
me
asked
the
sheikh
you
shall
know
all
in
the
morning
the
sheikh
face
changed
again
taking
on
a
look
of
mingled
rage
and
cunning
i
know
then
what
it
is
the
rumour
is
true
that
those
cursed
zionists
intend
to
desecrate
the
place
this
fellow
who
you
say
is
deaf
and
dumb
is
one
of
your
spies
is
he
not
perhaps
he
can
smell
a
zionist
eh
well
there
are
others
better
tell
me
the
truth
jimgrim
and
in
fifteen
minutes
i
will
pack
this
place
so
full
of
true
moslems
that
no
conspirator
could
worm
his
way
in
then
if
the
jews
start
anything
let
them
beware
by
the
beard
of
your
prophet
grim
answered
impiously
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
zionists
neither
have
i
then
anything
to
do
with
this
trespass
you
have
my
leave
to
depart
at
once
jimgrim
after
the
ruin
there
will
be
no
ruin
jimgrim
i
will
fill
the
place
with
men
better
empty
it
of
men
the
more
there
are
in
it
the
bigger
the
shall
i
say
afterwards
that
i
begged
leave
to
set
a
watch
and
you
refused
you
you
jimgrim
you
talk
to
me
of
ruin
and
a
you
are
no
alarmist
did
you
ever
catch
me
in
a
lie
no
jimgrim
you
are
too
clever
by
far
for
that
if
you
were
to
concoct
a
lie
it
would
take
ten
angels
to
unravel
it
but
you
speak
of
ruin
and
a
eh
he
stroked
his
beard
for
about
a
minute
you
have
heard
perhaps
that
moslems
are
sharpening
their
swords
for
a
reckoning
with
the
jews
there
may
be
some
truth
in
it
but
there
shall
be
no
gathering
in
this
place
for
any
such
purpose
for
i
will
see
to
that
you
need
set
no
watch
in
here
on
that
account
the
time
always
comes
grim
answered
when
you
must
trust
a
man
or
mistrust
him
you
known
me
eleven
years
what
are
you
going
to
do
in
the
name
of
god
what
shall
i
answer
taib
jimgrim
i
will
trust
you
what
is
it
you
wish
right
to
leave
this
man
and
the
boy
below
the
rock
undisturbed
that
can
not
well
be
occasionally
others
go
to
pray
in
that
place
also
there
is
a
moslem
who
has
made
the
pilgrimage
from
trichinopoli
i
myself
have
promised
to
show
him
the
mosque
tonight
because
he
leaves
jerusalem
at
dawn
and
only
i
speak
a
language
he
can
understand
there
will
be
others
with
him
and
i
can
not
refuse
to
take
them
down
below
the
rock
that
is
nothing
grim
answered
they
will
think
nothing
of
a
man
praying
or
sleeping
in
a
a
corner
is
that
all
he
wishes
to
do
he
will
remain
still
in
one
place
then
come
one
other
thing
that
fellow
who
went
and
fetched
you
he
sits
over
there
by
the
north
door
now
he
will
ask
you
questions
about
me
presently
tell
him
i
leaving
for
damascus
in
the
morning
if
he
asks
what
we
have
been
speaking
about
so
long
tell
him
i
brought
you
the
compliments
of
mustapha
kemal
i
will
tell
him
to
go
to
jahannam
better
be
civil
to
him
his
hour
comes
tomorrow
the
sheikh
led
the
way
along
one
side
of
the
inner
of
three
concentric
parts
into
which
the
mosque
is
divided
by
rows
of
marble
columns
until
we
came
to
a
cavernous
opening
in
the
floor
where
steps
hewn
in
the
naked
rock
led
downward
into
a
cave
that
underlies
the
spot
on
which
tradition
says
abraham
made
ready
to
sacrifice
his
son
it
was
very
dark
below
only
one
little
oil
lamp
was
burning
on
a
rock
shaped
like
an
altar
in
one
corner
it
cast
leaping
shadows
that
looked
like
ghosts
on
the
smooth
uneven
walls
the
whole
place
was
hardly
more
than
twenty
feet
wide
each
way
there
was
no
furniture
not
even
the
usual
mats
nothing
but
naked
rock
to
lie
or
sit
on
polished
smooth
as
glass
by
centuries
of
naked
feet
i
was
going
to
sit
in
a
corner
but
grim
seized
my
arm
and
pointed
to
the
centre
of
the
floor
stamping
with
his
foot
to
show
the
exact
place
i
should
take
it
rang
vaguely
hollow
under
the
impact
and
suliman
already
frightened
by
the
shadows
seized
my
hand
in
a
paroxysm
of
terror
you
got
to
prove
you
a
man
tonight
and
stick
it
out
grim
said
to
him
in
english
and
with
that
rather
than
argue
the
point
and
risk
a
scene
he
followed
the
sheikh
up
the
steps
and
disappeared
grim
methods
with
suliman
were
a
strange
mixture
of
understanding
sympathy
and
downright
indifference
to
sentiment
that
got
him
severely
criticized
by
the
party
who
always
everywhere
condemn
but
he
certainly
got
results
a
legion
of
biblical
and
koranic
devils
owned
suliman
they
were
the
child
religion
when
he
dared
he
spat
at
the
name
of
christianity
whenever
grim
whipped
him
which
he
had
to
do
now
and
again
for
theft
or
for
filthy
language
he
used
to
curse
grim
religion
although
grim
religion
was
a
secret
known
to
none
but
himself
but
the
kid
was
loyal
to
grim
with
a
courage
and
persistence
past
belief
and
grim
knew
how
to
worm
the
truth
out
of
him
and
make
him
keep
his
word
which
is
more
than
some
of
the
professional
reformers
know
how
to
do
with
their
proteges
i
believe
that
suliman
would
rather
have
earned
grim
curt
praise
than
all
the
fabulous
delights
of
even
a
moslem
paradise
but
the
kid
was
in
torment
his
idea
of
manliness
precluded
any
exhibition
of
fear
in
front
of
me
if
he
could
possibly
restrain
himself
he
would
not
have
minded
breaking
down
in
front
of
grim
for
he
knew
that
grim
knew
him
inside
out
on
the
contrary
he
looked
down
on
me
as
a
mere
amateur
at
the
game
who
had
never
starved
at
the
jaffa
gate
nor
eaten
or
gambled
for
with
sons
while
picking
up
odds
and
ends
of
gossip
for
a
government
that
hardly
knew
of
his
existence
in
front
of
me
he
proposed
to
act
the
man
guide
showman
mentor
he
considered
himself
my
boss
smallest
coin
of
the
country
but
it
was
stem
work
if
there
had
been
a
little
noise
to
make
the
shadows
less
ghostly
if
suliman
had
not
been
full
of
digested
superstition
or
if
he
had
not
overheard
enough
to
be
aware
that
a
prodigious
secret
plot
was
in
some
way
connected
with
that
cavern
he
could
have
kept
his
courage
up
by
swaggering
in
front
of
me
he
nearly
fell
asleep
with
his
head
in
my
lap
at
the
end
of
but
when
there
was
a
sound
at
last
he
almost
screamed
i
had
to
clap
my
hand
over
his
mouth
whereat
he
promptly
bit
my
finger
resentful
because
he
knew
then
that
i
knew
he
was
afraid
it
proved
to
be
approaching
footsteps
the
sheikh
of
the
mosque
again
leading
the
man
from
trichinopoli
and
a
party
of
three
friends
their
rear
was
brought
up
by
noureddin
ali
spy
anxious
about
me
but
pretending
to
want
to
overhear
the
account
of
things
the
sheikh
reeled
it
all
off
in
a
cultured
voice
accustomed
to
using
the
exact
amount
of
energy
required
but
even
so
his
words
boomed
in
the
cavern
like
the
forethought
of
thunder
you
could
help
wondering
whether
a
man
of
his
intelligence
believed
quite
all
he
said
however
much
impressed
the
man
from
trichinopoli
might
be
we
are
now
beneath
the
very
rock
on
which
abraham
was
willing
to
sacrifice
his
only
son
isaac
this
rock
is
the
centre
of
the
world
jacob
anointed
it
king
solomon
built
his
temple
over
it
the
prophet
of
god
the
prince
mahommed
on
whose
head
be
blessings
said
of
this
place
that
it
is
next
in
order
of
holiness
after
mecca
and
that
one
prayer
said
here
is
worth
ten
elsewhere
here
in
this
place
is
where
king
solomon
used
to
kneel
in
prayer
and
where
god
appeared
to
him
this
corner
is
where
david
prayed
here
prayed
mahommed
look
up
this
hollow
in
the
roof
is
over
the
spot
where
the
prophet
mahommed
slept
when
he
arose
there
was
not
room
for
him
to
stand
upright
so
the
rock
receded
and
the
hollow
place
remains
to
this
day
in
proof
of
it
beneath
us
is
the
arwah
the
well
of
souls
where
those
who
have
died
come
to
pray
twice
weekly
listen
he
stamped
three
times
with
his
foot
on
the
spot
about
two
feet
in
front
of
where
i
sat
and
a
faint
hollow
boom
answered
the
impact
you
hear
the
rock
speaks
it
spoke
in
plain
words
when
the
prophet
prayed
here
and
was
translated
instantly
to
heaven
on
his
horse
here
deep
in
the
rock
is
the
print
of
the
hand
of
the
angel
who
restrained
the
rock
from
following
the
prophet
on
his
way
to
paradise
here
in
this
niche
is
where
abraham
used
to
pray
here
elijah
on
the
last
day
the
kaaba
of
mecca
must
come
to
this
place
for
it
is
here
in
this
cave
that
the
blast
of
the
trumpet
will
sound
announcing
the
day
of
judgment
then
god
throne
will
be
planted
on
the
rock
above
us
be
humble
in
the
presence
of
these
marvels
he
turned
on
his
pompous
heel
and
led
the
way
out
again
without
as
much
as
a
sidewise
glance
at
me
the
spy
was
satisfied
he
followed
the
party
up
the
steps
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
went
to
sleep
on
a
mat
near
the
north
door
for
so
i
found
him
later
on
the
silence
shut
down
again
suliman
went
fast
asleep
snoring
with
the
even
cadence
of
a
clock
tick
using
my
knees
for
a
pillow
with
a
perfect
sense
of
ownership
he
was
there
to
keep
care
of
me
not
i
of
him
the
sleep
suggestion
very
soon
took
hold
of
me
too
for
there
was
nothing
whatever
to
do
but
sit
and
watch
the
shadows
move
trying
to
liken
them
to
something
real
as
they
changed
shape
in
answer
to
the
flickering
of
the
tiny
naked
flame
thereafter
the
vigil
resolved
itself
into
a
battle
with
sleep
and
an
effort
to
keep
my
wits
sufficiently
alert
for
sudden
use
i
had
no
watch
there
was
nothing
to
give
the
least
notion
of
how
much
time
had
passed
i
even
counted
the
boy
snores
for
a
while
and
watched
one
lonely
louse
moving
along
the
wall
so
many
snores
to
the
minute
so
many
snores
to
an
inch
of
crawling
but
the
louse
changed
what
little
mind
he
had
and
did
not
walk
straight
and
i
gave
up
trying
to
calculate
the
distance
he
traveled
in
zigzags
and
curves
although
it
would
have
been
an
interesting
problem
for
a
navigator
finally
snoring
grew
so
loud
that
that
in
itself
kept
me
awake
it
was
like
listening
to
a
each
blast
of
it
rasped
your
nerves
you
could
not
hear
anything
in
the
mosque
above
although
there
were
only
eleven
steps
and
the
opening
was
close
at
hand
for
the
floor
above
was
thickly
carpeted
and
if
there
were
any
sounds
they
were
swallowed
by
that
and
the
great
domed
roof
when
i
guessed
it
might
be
midnight
i
listened
for
the
voice
of
the
muezzin
but
if
he
did
call
the
faithful
to
wake
up
and
pray
he
did
it
from
a
minaret
outside
and
no
faint
echo
of
his
voice
reached
me
i
was
closed
in
a
tomb
in
the
womb
of
living
rock
to
all
intents
and
purposes
but
it
must
have
been
somewhere
about
midnight
when
i
heard
a
sound
that
set
every
vein
in
my
body
tingling
at
first
it
was
like
the
sort
of
sound
that
a
rat
makes
gnawing
but
there
could
be
rats
eating
their
way
through
that
solid
stone
i
thought
i
heard
it
a
second
time
but
suliman
snoring
made
it
impossible
to
listen
properly
i
shook
him
violently
and
he
sat
up
keep
still
listen
between
sleeping
and
waking
the
boy
forgot
all
about
the
iron
he
practised
for
grim
exacting
sake
what
is
it
i
am
afraid
be
still
confound
you
listen
how
close
beneath
us
are
the
souls
of
the
dead
oh
i
am
afraid
silence
breathe
through
your
mouth
make
no
noise
at
all
he
took
my
hand
and
tried
to
sit
absolutely
still
but
the
gnawing
noise
began
again
more
distinctly
followed
by
two
or
three
dull
thuds
from
somewhere
beneath
us
oh
it
is
the
souls
of
dead
men
oh
shut
up
you
little
idiot
all
right
i
tell
jimgrim
fear
and
that
threat
combined
were
altogether
too
much
for
him
one
sprig
of
seedling
manhood
remained
to
him
and
only
one
the
will
to
smother
emotion
that
he
could
not
control
a
second
longer
he
buried
his
head
in
my
lap
stuffing
his
mouth
with
the
end
of
the
abiyi
to
choke
the
sobs
back
i
covered
his
head
completely
and
like
the
fabled
ostrich
in
that
darkness
he
felt
better
suddenly
as
clear
as
the
ring
of
glass
against
thick
glass
in
the
distance
something
gave
way
and
fell
beneath
us
then
again
then
there
were
several
thuds
followed
by
a
rumble
that
was
unmistakable
falling
masonry
it
was
the
noise
that
bricks
make
when
they
dump
them
from
a
only
smothered
by
the
thickness
of
the
cavern
floor
i
shook
suliman
again
come
on
we
going
now
let
me
have
a
good
account
of
you
to
give
to
jimgrim
shut
your
teeth
tight
and
remember
the
part
you
got
to
play
he
scrambled
up
the
steps
ahead
of
me
and
i
had
to
keep
hold
of
the
skirts
of
his
smock
to
prevent
him
from
running
but
he
took
my
hand
at
the
top
and
we
managed
to
get
out
through
the
north
door
without
exciting
comment
and
without
waking
the
spy
although
i
would
just
as
soon
have
wakened
him
for
grim
seemed
to
think
it
important
that
his
alibi
and
mine
should
be
well
established
however
there
were
two
others
watching
by
the
hotel
ten
minutes
later
i
was
glad
i
had
not
disturbed
him
i
gave
suliman
a
piece
to
pay
the
man
who
had
charge
of
my
slippers
at
the
door
and
the
young
rascal
was
so
far
recovered
from
his
fright
that
he
demanded
change
out
of
it
and
stood
there
arguing
until
he
got
it
then
we
crossed
the
great
moonlit
open
court
to
the
gate
by
which
grim
had
brought
us
in
looking
back
so
bright
was
the
moon
that
you
could
even
see
the
blue
of
the
tiles
that
cover
the
mosque
wall
and
the
interwoven
scroll
of
writing
from
the
koran
that
runs
around
like
a
frieze
below
the
dome
but
it
did
not
look
real
it
was
like
a
perhaps
the
dream
of
the
men
who
slept
huddled
under
blankets
in
the
porches
by
the
gate
if
so
they
dreamed
beautifully
there
was
a
sikh
as
grim
had
said
there
would
be
standing
with
fixed
bayonet
on
the
bottom
step
leading
to
the
street
he
stared
hard
at
me
and
brought
his
rifle
to
the
challenge
as
i
approached
him
a
stalwart
he
was
with
a
long
row
of
campaign
ribbons
and
the
true
truculent
sikh
way
of
carrying
his
head
he
looked
strong
enough
to
carry
an
ox
away
atcha
said
i
going
close
to
him
he
did
not
answer
a
word
but
shouldered
his
rifle
and
marched
off
before
he
had
gone
six
paces
he
brought
the
rifle
to
the
trail
and
started
running
another
sikh
a
younger
man
stepped
out
of
the
shadow
and
took
his
place
on
the
lower
step
he
was
not
quite
so
silent
and
he
knew
at
least
one
word
of
arabic
imshi
he
grunted
and
that
in
plain
american
means
beat
it
i
had
no
objection
it
sounded
rather
like
good
advice
remembering
what
grim
had
said
about
the
danger
i
was
running
and
looking
at
the
deep
black
shadows
of
the
streets
it
occurred
to
me
that
that
spy
who
slept
so
soundly
by
the
mosque
door
might
wake
up
and
be
annoyed
with
himself
when
men
of
that
type
get
annoyed
they
generally
like
to
work
it
off
on
somebody
rather
than
admit
that
he
had
let
me
get
away
from
him
he
might
prefer
to
track
me
through
the
streets
and
use
his
knife
on
me
in
some
dark
corner
after
that
he
could
claim
credit
with
noureddin
ali
by
swearing
he
had
reason
to
suspect
me
of
something
or
other
the
suggestion
did
not
seem
any
more
unreal
to
me
than
the
moonlit
panorama
of
the
or
the
sikh
who
had
stepped
out
of
to
imshi
me
away
on
the
other
hand
i
had
no
fancy
for
the
hotel
steps
to
sit
and
fall
asleep
there
would
be
to
place
myself
at
the
mercy
of
the
other
two
spies
who
might
come
and
search
me
and
i
was
conscious
of
certain
papers
in
an
inner
pocket
and
of
underclothes
made
in
america
that
might
have
given
the
game
away
besides
i
was
no
longer
any
too
sure
of
suliman
the
boy
was
so
sleepy
that
his
wits
were
hardly
in
working
order
if
those
two
spies
by
the
hotel
were
to
question
him
he
might
betray
the
two
of
us
by
some
clumsy
answer
if
there
was
to
be
trouble
that
night
i
preferred
to
have
it
at
the
hands
of
sikhs
who
are
seldom
very
drastic
unless
you
show
violence
i
might
be
arrested
if
i
walked
the
streets
but
that
would
be
sheer
profit
as
compared
to
of
cold
knife
in
the
broad
of
my
back
take
me
to
the
house
where
you
talked
with
your
mother
i
said
to
suliman
so
we
turned
to
the
left
and
set
off
together
in
that
direction
watched
with
something
more
than
mild
suspicion
by
the
sikh
and
if
suliman
sensations
were
anything
like
mine
feeling
about
as
cheerless
homeless
and
aware
of
impending
evil
as
the
dogs
that
slunk
away
into
the
night
i
took
advantage
of
the
first
deep
shadow
i
could
find
to
walk
in
less
minded
to
explore
than
to
avoid
pursuit
chapter
eighteen
but
we
ready
for
them
without
in
the
least
suspecting
it
i
had
gone
straight
into
a
blind
trap
into
which
it
was
true
i
could
not
be
followed
by
noureddin
ali
spy
but
out
of
which
there
was
no
escape
without
being
recognized
the
moment
i
stepped
into
the
deep
shadow
i
heard
an
unmistakable
massed
movement
behind
me
sure
that
i
could
not
be
seen
i
faced
about
a
platoon
of
sikhs
had
appeared
from
somewhere
and
were
standing
at
ease
already
across
the
end
of
the
street
i
had
entered
with
the
moonlight
silvering
their
bayonets
well
most
streets
have
two
ends
so
i
walked
forward
not
taking
much
trouble
about
concealment
since
it
was
not
easy
to
walk
silently
if
the
sikh
ca
see
his
enemy
he
likes
to
fire
first
and
challenge
afterwards
i
preferred
to
be
seen
the
sight
of
those
uncompromising
bayonets
had
changed
my
mind
about
the
choice
of
evils
the
knife
of
a
hardly
probable
assassin
seemed
a
wiser
risk
than
the
ready
triggers
of
the
punjaub
down
the
street
suliman
tugged
at
my
cloak
that
is
the
place
where
my
mother
is
he
said
pointing
to
a
narrow
door
on
the
left
but
i
was
taking
no
chances
in
that
direction
not
at
that
moment
the
little
stone
house
was
all
in
darkness
there
were
no
windows
that
i
could
see
no
sound
came
from
it
and
farther
down
the
street
there
was
a
lamp
burning
whose
light
spelled
safety
from
shots
fired
at
the
sound
of
on
suspicion
i
wanted
that
light
between
me
and
the
sikh
platoon
yet
did
not
dare
run
for
it
since
that
would
surely
have
started
trouble
it
is
my
experience
of
sikhs
that
when
they
start
a
thing
they
like
to
finish
it
they
are
very
good
indeed
at
explanations
after
the
event
the
sikhs
must
have
seen
us
pass
through
the
belt
of
gasoline
light
but
they
did
not
challenge
so
i
went
forward
more
slowly
with
rather
less
of
that
creepy
feeling
that
makes
a
man
spine
seem
to
belong
to
some
one
else
toward
its
lower
end
the
street
curved
considerably
and
we
went
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
before
the
glare
of
another
light
began
to
appear
around
the
bend
that
was
at
a
up
which
i
proposed
to
turn
more
or
less
in
the
direction
of
the
hotel
but
i
did
nothing
of
the
sort
there
was
a
cordon
of
sikhs
drawn
across
there
too
with
no
british
officer
in
sight
to
enforce
discretion
come
to
think
of
it
i
have
always
regarded
a
bayonet
wound
in
the
stomach
as
the
least
desirable
of
life
unpleasantries
so
suliman
and
i
turned
back
i
decided
to
investigate
that
dark
little
stone
house
after
all
for
it
occurred
to
me
that
if
that
was
the
centre
of
conspiracy
then
grim
would
certainly
show
up
there
sooner
or
later
and
straighten
out
the
predicament
have
you
ever
noticed
how
hungry
you
get
walking
about
aimlessly
in
the
dark
especially
when
you
are
sleepy
in
the
bargain
suliman
began
to
whimper
for
food
and
although
i
called
him
a
belly
on
legs
by
way
of
encouragement
he
had
my
secret
sympathy
i
was
as
hungry
as
he
was
and
i
needed
a
drink
too
which
he
did
the
little
devil
had
yet
included
whiskey
in
his
list
of
vices
the
side
of
the
street
an
which
the
little
stone
house
stood
was
the
darker
so
we
sat
down
with
our
backs
against
its
wall
and
the
boy
proceeded
to
fall
asleep
at
once
the
one
thing
i
was
sure
i
must
not
do
was
imitate
him
so
i
began
to
look
about
me
in
the
hope
of
finding
something
sufficiently
interesting
to
keep
me
awake
there
was
nothing
in
the
street
except
the
makings
of
a
bad
smell
there
was
plenty
of
that
i
searched
the
opposite
wall
on
which
the
moon
shone
but
there
was
nothing
there
of
even
architectural
interest
my
eyes
traveled
higher
and
rested
at
last
on
something
extremely
curious
the
wall
was
not
very
high
at
that
point
it
formed
the
blind
rear
of
a
house
that
faced
into
a
court
of
some
sort
approached
by
an
alley
from
another
street
there
were
no
windows
a
small
door
some
distance
to
my
left
belonged
obviously
to
the
next
house
on
top
of
the
wall
almost
exactly
but
not
quite
in
the
middle
of
it
was
a
figure
that
looked
like
a
wooden
carving
something
like
one
of
those
fat
seated
chinamen
they
used
to
set
over
the
tea
counter
of
big
grocer
shops
but
the
one
thing
that
you
never
see
and
can
be
sure
of
not
seeing
in
jerusalem
outside
of
a
christian
church
is
a
carved
human
figure
of
any
kind
the
moslems
are
fanatical
on
that
point
whatever
exterior
statues
the
crusaders
for
instance
left
the
saracens
and
turks
destroyed
besides
why
was
it
not
exactly
in
the
middle
it
was
much
too
big
and
to
be
a
sleeping
vulture
it
was
the
wrong
shape
to
be
any
sort
of
chimney
it
was
certainly
not
a
bale
of
merchandise
put
up
on
the
roof
to
dry
and
the
longer
you
looked
at
it
the
less
it
seemed
to
resemble
anything
recognizable
i
had
about
reached
the
conclusion
that
it
must
be
a
bundle
of
sheepskins
ready
to
be
spread
out
in
the
morning
sun
and
was
going
to
cast
about
for
something
else
to
puzzle
over
when
it
moved
the
man
who
thinks
he
would
not
feel
afraid
when
a
thing
like
that
moves
in
the
dark
unexpectedly
has
got
to
prove
it
before
i
believe
him
the
broke
out
all
over
me
a
moment
later
the
thing
tilted
forward
and
a
man
head
emerged
from
under
a
blanket
it
chuckled
damnably
if
there
had
been
a
rock
of
the
right
size
within
reach
i
would
have
thrown
it
for
it
is
not
agreeable
to
be
chuckled
at
when
you
are
hungry
sleepy
and
in
a
trap
i
know
just
how
trapped
animals
feel
but
then
it
spoke
in
good
plain
english
and
you
could
not
mistake
the
voice
that
what
comes
of
suiting
yourself
does
it
place
plugged
at
both
ends
and
nowhere
to
go
but
there
and
back
thanks
for
tipping
off
narayan
singh
you
see
we
were
all
ready
here
a
pass
that
let
you
out
catch
he
threw
down
a
piece
of
white
paper
folded
show
that
to
the
sikhs
at
either
end
now
beat
it
while
the
going
good
leave
suliman
there
i
shall
want
him
when
he
has
had
his
sleep
out
say
had
you
better
change
your
mind
about
coming
back
too
soon
from
that
joy
ride
have
you
had
enough
of
this
the
next
move
dangerous
is
it
my
choice
i
asked
we
owe
you
some
consideration
then
i
in
on
the
last
act
all
right
but
do
blame
me
turner
will
give
you
orders
get
a
move
on
i
lowered
suliman
head
gently
from
my
knee
on
to
a
nice
comfortable
corner
of
the
stone
gutter
and
went
to
interview
the
sikhs
it
was
rather
like
a
new
york
customs
inspection
after
your
cabin
steward
has
not
been
heavily
enough
tipped
and
has
tipped
off
the
men
in
blue
by
way
of
distributing
the
discontent
i
showed
them
the
grim
had
scribbled
they
accepted
that
as
dubious
preliminary
evidence
of
my
right
to
be
alive
but
no
more
i
was
searched
painstakingly
and
ignominiously
for
weapons
no
questions
asked
nothing
taken
for
granted
even
my
small
change
was
examined
in
the
moonlight
coin
by
coin
to
make
sure
i
suppose
that
it
would
explode
if
struck
on
stone
they
gave
everything
back
to
me
including
my
underwear
a
bearded
officer
entered
a
description
of
me
in
a
pocket
memorandum
book
if
his
face
as
he
wrote
it
was
anything
to
judge
by
he
described
me
as
a
leper
without
a
license
then
i
was
cautioned
gruffly
in
an
unknown
tongue
and
told
to
imshi
it
is
a
bad
plan
to
imshi
rather
quickly
when
a
sikh
platoon
suggests
your
doing
it
i
left
them
standing
all
alone
with
nothing
but
the
empty
night
to
bristle
at
the
rest
of
that
night
until
before
dawn
was
a
dream
of
discomfort
and
chilly
draughts
in
the
mouth
of
the
hotel
arcade
where
i
sat
and
watched
the
spies
and
they
watched
me
the
third
man
was
presumably
still
sleeping
in
the
mosque
but
it
was
satisfactory
to
know
that
the
other
two
were
just
as
cold
and
unhappy
as
i
felt
about
ten
minutes
before
the
car
came
the
third
man
showed
up
sheepishly
looking
surprised
as
well
as
relieved
to
find
me
sitting
there
he
put
in
several
minutes
explaining
matters
to
his
friends
i
do
doubt
he
lied
like
a
and
gave
a
detailed
account
of
having
followed
me
from
place
to
place
for
he
used
a
great
deal
of
pantomimic
gesture
the
other
two
were
cynical
with
the
air
of
men
who
must
sit
and
listen
to
another
blowing
his
own
trumpet
the
car
arrived
with
a
fanfare
of
the
chauffeur
evidently
having
had
instructions
to
call
lots
of
attention
to
himself
turner
came
out
at
once
with
the
lower
part
of
his
face
protected
against
the
morning
chill
by
a
muffler
being
about
the
same
height
and
in
that
syrian
uniform
he
looked
remarkably
like
grim
except
that
he
did
not
imitate
the
stride
nearly
as
well
he
stumbled
over
me
clutched
my
shoulder
and
made
signs
for
the
benefit
of
the
spies
then
he
whispered
to
me
to
help
him
carry
out
the
money
bags
so
we
each
took
three
for
the
first
trip
and
each
contrived
to
drop
one
by
the
time
all
ten
bags
were
in
the
car
there
can
hardly
have
remained
any
doubt
in
the
conspirators
minds
that
we
were
really
taking
funds
to
mustapha
kemal
or
at
any
rate
to
somebody
up
north
but
davey
was
no
concession
maker
having
lent
himself
unwillingly
to
the
trick
he
did
his
utmost
to
make
it
succeed
like
a
good
sport
he
stuck
his
head
out
of
a
bedroom
window
do
forget
now
to
send
me
those
rugs
from
damascus
he
shouted
it
all
went
like
clockwork
glancing
back
as
we
drove
by
the
jaffa
gate
i
saw
the
three
spies
walk
away
and
there
is
very
often
more
information
in
men
backs
than
in
their
faces
they
walked
like
laborers
returning
home
with
a
day
work
behind
them
finished
not
at
all
like
men
in
doubt
nor
as
if
they
suspected
they
were
followed
although
in
fact
they
were
three
sikhs
emerged
from
the
corner
by
the
gate
and
strolled
along
behind
them
detailed
preparations
for
the
had
begun
the
unostentatious
mechanism
of
it
seemed
more
weird
and
terrible
than
the
conspiracy
itself
there
was
a
full
company
of
sikhs
standing
to
arms
in
a
side
street
leading
off
the
jaffa
road
but
they
took
no
notice
of
us
their
officer
looked
keenly
at
us
once
and
then
very
deliberately
stared
the
other
way
illustrating
how
some
fighting
men
make
pretty
poor
dissemblers
every
one
of
his
rank
and
file
had
observed
all
the
details
of
our
outfit
without
seeming
to
see
us
at
all
we
using
nothing
but
sikhs
on
this
job
said
turner
british
troops
would
appreciate
the
delicacy
of
the
situation
moslems
could
be
trusted
not
to
talk
the
sikhs
enjoy
the
surreptitious
part
of
it
and
do
care
enough
about
the
politics
to
get
excited
wish
i
might
be
in
at
the
finish
though
have
you
any
notion
what
the
real
objective
is
no
said
i
and
tried
not
to
feel
or
look
pleased
with
myself
but
no
mere
amateur
can
conceal
that
in
the
moment
of
discovery
he
knows
more
about
the
inside
of
an
official
business
than
one
of
the
administration
lawful
agents
that
is
of
the
secret
of
bossed
politics
the
sheer
vanity
of
being
on
the
inside
in
the
know
i
suppose
i
smirked
damn
this
ride
to
haifa
what
the
hell
have
you
done
i
wonder
that
you
should
have
a
front
pew
is
the
intelligence
short
of
officers
i
had
done
nothing
beyond
making
grim
acquaintance
and
by
good
luck
tickling
his
flair
for
odd
friendship
i
thought
it
better
not
to
say
that
so
i
went
on
lying
i
do
suppose
i
know
any
more
than
you
do
rot
i
posted
the
men
who
watched
you
into
djemal
place
yesterday
and
watched
you
out
again
you
acted
pretty
poorly
if
you
ask
me
it
a
marvel
we
did
have
to
go
in
there
and
rescue
you
i
suppose
you
another
of
grim
favorites
he
picks
some
funny
ones
half
the
men
in
jail
seem
to
be
friends
of
his
i
decided
to
change
the
subject
i
was
told
to
change
clothes
and
walk
back
after
a
mile
or
so
i
said
suppose
we
do
make
it
a
marathon
why
walk
farther
than
we
need
to
uh
i
think
he
was
feeling
sore
enough
to
take
me
ten
miles
for
the
satisfaction
of
making
me
tramp
them
back
to
jerusalem
but
it
turned
out
not
to
be
his
day
for
working
off
grievances
we
were
bowling
along
pretty
fast
and
had
just
reached
open
country
where
it
would
be
a
simple
matter
to
change
into
other
clothes
without
risk
of
being
seen
doing
it
when
we
began
to
be
overhauled
by
another
larger
car
that
came
along
at
a
terrific
pace
it
was
still
too
dark
to
make
out
who
was
in
it
until
it
drew
almost
abreast
the
administrator
by
the
horn
spoon
what
next
i
wonder
pull
up
said
turner
morning
sir
the
two
cars
came
to
a
standstill
the
administrator
leaned
out
i
think
i
can
save
you
a
walk
he
said
smiling
how
about
changing
your
clothes
between
the
cars
and
driving
back
with
me
i
did
not
even
know
yet
what
new
disguise
i
was
to
assume
but
turner
opened
a
and
produced
a
suit
of
my
own
clothes
and
a
soft
hat
burgled
your
bedroom
he
explained
all
he
had
forgotten
was
suspenders
no
doubt
it
would
have
given
him
immense
joy
to
think
of
me
walking
back
ten
miles
without
them
sir
louis
gave
his
orders
while
i
changed
clothes
you
better
keep
going
for
some
time
turner
no
need
to
go
all
the
way
to
haifa
but
do
get
back
to
jerusalem
before
noon
at
the
earliest
and
be
sure
you
do
talk
to
anybody
on
your
way
turner
drove
on
i
got
in
beside
the
administrator
grim
tells
me
that
you
do
object
to
a
certain
amount
of
risk
you
been
very
useful
and
he
thinks
you
would
like
to
see
the
end
of
the
business
i
would
think
of
agreeing
to
it
only
we
shall
have
to
call
on
you
as
a
witness
against
scharnhoff
and
noureddin
ali
as
you
seem
able
to
keep
still
about
what
you
know
it
seems
wiser
not
to
change
witnesses
at
this
stage
it
is
highly
important
that
we
should
have
one
unofficial
observer
who
is
neither
jew
nor
moslem
and
who
has
no
private
interest
to
serve
but
i
warn
you
what
is
likely
to
happen
this
morning
will
be
risky
i
looked
at
the
scar
on
his
cheek
and
the
campaign
ribbons
and
the
attitude
of
absolute
poise
that
can
only
be
attained
by
years
of
familiarity
with
danger
why
do
you
soldiers
always
act
like
nursemaids
toward
civilians
i
asked
him
we
bone
of
your
bone
he
laughed
entrenched
privilege
if
we
let
you
know
too
much
you
think
too
little
of
us
we
stopped
at
a
jew
store
outside
the
city
for
suspenders
and
then
made
the
circuit
outside
the
walls
in
a
whirlwind
of
dust
stopping
only
at
each
gate
to
get
reports
from
the
officers
commanding
companies
drawn
up
in
readiness
to
march
in
and
police
the
city
it
all
over
the
place
that
disaster
of
some
sort
is
going
to
happen
today
said
sir
louis
it
only
needs
a
hatful
of
rumours
to
set
jerusalemites
at
one
another
throats
but
ready
for
them
the
first
to
start
trouble
this
morning
will
be
the
first
to
get
it
now
sorry
you
no
time
for
breakfast
here
the
jaffa
gate
will
you
walk
through
the
city
to
that
street
where
grim
talked
with
you
from
a
roof
last
night
find
him
thereabouts
sure
you
know
the
way
good
luck
no
you
wo
need
a
pass
there
be
nobody
to
interfere
with
you
chapter
nineteen
dead
or
alive
sahib
i
did
get
breakfast
nevertheless
but
in
a
strange
place
the
city
shutters
were
coming
down
only
under
protest
because
just
as
in
boston
and
other
hubs
of
sanctity
starts
less
than
five
minutes
after
the
police
let
go
control
there
was
an
average
that
morning
of
about
ten
rumours
to
the
ear
so
the
had
to
be
ordered
to
open
up
about
the
mildest
rumour
was
that
the
british
had
decide
to
vacate
and
to
leave
the
zionists
in
charge
of
things
you
could
fool
an
experienced
jew
as
to
what
would
happen
in
that
event
there
was
another
rumour
that
mustapha
kemal
was
on
the
march
another
that
an
arab
army
was
invading
from
the
direction
of
but
there
were
british
officers
walking
about
with
memorandum
books
and
a
fine
looked
more
serious
than
an
outbreak
that
had
not
occurred
yet
so
they
were
putting
down
their
shutters
i
had
nearly
reached
the
and
was
passing
a
platoon
of
sikhs
who
dozed
beside
their
rifles
near
a
street
corner
when
grim
voice
hailed
me
through
the
door
behind
them
he
was
back
in
his
favourite
disguise
as
a
bedouin
squatting
on
a
mat
near
the
entrance
of
a
vaulted
room
where
he
could
see
through
the
door
without
being
seen
this
is
headquarters
for
the
present
he
explained
soon
as
we
bag
the
game
we
run
in
here
quick
as
lightning
most
likely
keep
here
all
day
so
not
to
have
to
parade
through
the
streets
until
after
dark
a
man
coming
soon
with
coffee
and
stuff
to
eat
what
become
of
suliman
he
shooting
craps
with
two
other
young
villains
close
to
where
you
left
him
last
night
i
hoping
he
get
word
with
his
mother
grim
looked
more
nervous
than
i
had
ever
seen
him
there
was
a
deep
frown
between
his
eyes
he
talked
as
if
he
were
doing
it
to
keep
himself
from
worrying
what
eating
you
i
asked
noureddin
ali
after
all
this
trouble
to
bag
the
whole
gang
without
any
fuss
there
a
chance
he
given
us
the
slip
i
watched
all
night
to
make
sure
he
did
come
out
of
that
door
he
did
but
i
no
proof
he
in
there
scharnhoff
in
there
and
five
of
the
chief
conspirators
noureddin
ali
may
be
but
a
man
brought
me
a
story
an
hour
ago
about
seeing
him
on
the
city
wall
however
here
the
food
so
let
eat
he
sat
and
munched
gloomily
until
presently
goodenough
joined
us
looking
what
with
that
monocle
and
one
thing
and
another
as
if
he
had
just
stepped
out
of
a
well
grim
the
net
all
ready
if
that
tnt
is
where
you
say
it
is
in
that
big
barn
behind
the
near
the
jaffa
gate
it
ours
the
minute
they
make
a
move
there
is
a
doubt
on
that
point
grim
answered
why
else
should
scharnhoff
open
a
the
license
for
it
was
taken
out
by
one
of
noureddin
ali
agents
whose
brother
deals
in
fruit
wholesale
and
owns
that
barn
narayan
singh
tracked
some
suspicious
packages
to
that
place
four
days
ago
start
to
carry
it
into
the
city
hidden
under
loads
of
fruit
just
as
soon
as
the
morning
crowd
begins
to
pour
in
we
only
need
let
them
get
the
first
consignment
in
so
as
to
have
the
chain
of
evidence
complete
are
you
sure
your
men
will
let
the
first
lot
go
through
absolutely
just
came
from
giving
them
very
careful
instructions
the
minute
that
first
load
disappears
into
the
city
they
close
in
on
the
barn
and
arrest
every
one
they
find
in
there
but
what
are
you
gloomy
about
i
hate
to
miss
the
big
fish
you
mean
noureddin
ali
it
looks
to
me
as
if
he
been
a
shade
too
wise
for
us
one
man
swore
he
saw
him
on
the
wall
this
morning
but
he
was
gone
when
i
sent
to
make
sure
we
got
all
the
rest
there
are
five
in
djemal
cafe
waiting
for
the
big
news
they
be
handcuffed
one
at
a
time
by
the
police
when
they
get
tired
of
waiting
and
come
out
but
i
rather
bag
noureddin
ali
than
all
the
others
put
together
he
got
brains
that
little
beast
has
he
know
how
to
use
this
story
against
us
with
almost
as
much
effect
as
if
he
pulled
the
outrage
off
he
had
hardly
finished
speaking
when
narayan
singh
great
bulk
darkened
the
doorway
he
closed
the
door
behind
him
as
if
afraid
the
other
sikhs
might
learn
bad
news
it
is
true
sahib
he
was
on
the
wall
he
is
there
again
have
you
seen
him
surely
he
makes
signals
to
the
men
who
are
loading
the
donkeys
now
in
the
door
of
the
barn
it
would
be
a
difficult
shot
his
head
hardly
shows
between
the
battlements
but
i
think
i
could
hit
him
from
the
road
below
shall
i
try
no
you
only
scare
him
into
hiding
if
you
miss
oh
hell
there
are
three
ways
up
on
to
the
wall
at
that
point
there
no
time
to
block
them
all
not
if
he
signalling
now
he
see
your
men
close
in
on
the
barn
sir
and
beat
it
for
the
skyline
oh
damn
and
blast
the
luck
at
least
we
can
try
to
cut
him
off
said
goodenough
take
some
men
myself
and
have
a
crack
at
it
no
use
sir
you
never
catch
sight
of
him
i
wish
you
let
narayan
singh
take
three
men
make
for
the
wall
by
the
shortest
way
and
hunt
him
if
it
takes
a
week
why
not
all
right
hear
that
narayan
singh
atcha
sahib
you
understand
said
grim
keep
him
moving
keep
after
him
do
the
sahibs
wish
him
alive
or
dead
either
way
said
goodenough
if
he
gone
from
the
wall
when
you
get
there
grim
added
bring
us
the
news
you
know
where
to
find
us
atcha
the
sikh
brought
his
rifle
to
the
shoulder
faced
about
marched
out
chose
three
men
from
the
platoon
in
the
street
and
vanished
too
bad
too
bad
said
goodenough
but
grim
did
not
answer
he
was
swearing
a
blue
streak
under
his
breath
the
next
to
arrive
on
the
scene
was
suliman
grinning
with
delight
because
he
had
won
all
the
money
of
the
other
urchins
but
brimming
with
news
in
the
bargain
he
considered
a
mere
colonel
of
cavalry
beneath
notice
and
addressed
himself
to
grim
without
ceremony
my
mother
brought
out
oranges
in
baskets
and
set
them
on
benches
on
both
sides
of
the
door
then
she
went
in
and
i
heard
her
scream
there
was
a
fight
inside
care
to
bet
sir
asked
grim
on
what
i
bet
you
a
hundred
piastres
scharnhoff
has
tried
to
make
his
and
they
either
killed
him
or
tied
him
hand
and
foot
another
hundred
on
top
of
that
that
scharnhoff
offers
to
turn
state
witness
provided
he
alive
when
we
show
up
all
right
i
bet
you
he
hangs
are
you
coming
with
us
sir
would
miss
it
for
a
king
ransom
the
back
way
out
then
grim
beckoned
the
sikhs
into
the
room
left
one
man
in
there
in
charge
of
suliman
who
swore
blasphemously
at
being
left
behind
and
led
the
way
down
a
passage
that
opened
into
an
alley
connecting
with
a
maze
of
others
like
rat
runs
mostly
arched
over
and
all
smelly
with
the
unwashed
gloom
of
ages
at
the
end
of
the
last
alley
we
entered
was
a
flight
of
stone
steps
up
which
we
climbed
to
the
roof
of
the
house
on
which
i
had
seen
grim
the
night
before
there
was
a
low
coping
on
the
side
next
the
street
and
some
one
had
laid
a
lot
of
bundles
of
odds
and
ends
against
it
lying
down
we
could
look
out
between
those
without
any
risk
of
being
seen
from
below
but
goodenough
made
the
sikhs
keep
well
in
the
background
and
only
we
three
peered
over
the
edge
about
two
hundred
yards
in
front
of
us
the
dome
of
the
rock
glistened
in
the
morning
sun
above
the
intervening
roofs
the
street
was
almost
deserted
although
the
guards
at
either
end
had
been
removed
for
fear
of
scaring
away
the
conspirators
we
watched
for
about
twenty
minutes
before
any
one
passed
but
occasional
beggars
some
of
whom
stopped
to
wonder
why
oranges
should
stand
on
sale
outside
a
door
with
nobody
in
charge
of
them
three
separate
individuals
glanced
right
and
left
and
then
helped
themselves
pretty
liberally
from
the
baskets
but
at
last
there
came
five
donkeys
very
heavily
loaded
with
oranges
and
raisins
in
charge
of
six
men
which
was
a
more
than
liberal
allowance
when
they
stopped
at
the
little
stone
house
in
front
of
us
there
was
another
thing
noticeable
instead
of
hitting
the
donkeys
hard
on
the
nose
with
a
thick
club
which
is
the
usual
way
of
calling
a
halt
in
palestine
they
went
to
the
heads
and
stopped
them
reasonably
gently
so
although
all
six
men
were
dressed
to
resemble
peasants
they
were
certainly
nothing
of
the
kind
nor
were
they
such
conspirators
as
they
believed
themselves
for
they
were
not
in
the
least
suspicious
of
six
other
men
also
dressed
as
peasants
who
followed
them
and
sat
down
in
full
view
with
their
backs
against
a
wall
yet
i
could
see
quite
plainly
the
scabbard
of
a
bayonet
projecting
through
a
hole
in
the
ragged
cloak
of
the
nearest
of
those
casual
wayfarers
they
had
to
knock
several
minutes
before
the
door
opened
gingerly
then
they
the
donkeys
and
it
took
two
men
to
carry
each
basketful
with
a
third
lending
a
hand
in
case
of
accident
only
one
man
went
back
with
the
donkeys
and
two
of
the
casual
loafers
against
the
wall
got
up
to
saunter
after
him
the
other
five
honest
merchants
went
inside
and
we
heard
the
bolt
shoot
into
its
iron
slot
behind
them
how
about
it
grim
asked
goodenough
then
ready
sir
will
you
give
the
order
we
filed
in
a
hurry
down
the
steps
into
the
alley
ran
in
a
zag
down
three
passages
and
reached
another
alley
with
narrow
door
at
its
end
that
faced
the
street
grim
had
made
every
preparation
there
was
a
heavy
baulk
of
timber
lying
near
the
door
with
knotted
into
holes
bored
through
it
at
intervals
the
sikhs
picked
that
up
and
followed
us
into
the
street
the
mechanism
of
the
administration
net
was
a
thing
to
wonder
at
as
we
emerged
through
the
door
the
peasants
who
were
loafing
with
their
backs
against
the
wall
got
up
and
formed
a
cordon
across
the
street
simultaneously
although
i
neither
saw
nor
heard
any
signal
a
dozen
sikhs
under
a
british
officer
came
down
the
street
from
the
other
direction
at
the
double
and
formed
up
in
line
on
our
lefthand
a
moment
later
our
men
were
battering
the
door
down
with
their
baulk
of
timber
working
all
together
as
if
they
had
practised
the
stunt
thoroughly
it
was
a
stout
door
three
inches
thick
of
ancient
olivewood
and
reinforced
with
forged
iron
bands
the
hinges
too
had
been
made
by
hand
in
the
days
when
if
a
man
house
was
not
his
fortress
he
might
just
as
well
own
nothing
they
were
cemented
deep
into
the
wall
and
fastened
to
the
door
itself
with
inch
iron
rivets
the
door
had
to
be
smashed
to
pieces
and
the
noise
we
made
would
have
warned
the
devils
in
the
middle
of
the
world
we
should
have
let
them
get
in
with
any
tnt
at
all
said
goodenough
they
touch
it
off
before
we
can
prevent
them
they
not
that
kind
grim
answered
they
fight
for
their
skins
have
your
gun
ready
sir
they
laid
their
plans
for
a
and
a
quick
getaway
they
figure
the
going
may
be
good
still
if
they
can
once
get
past
us
look
out
for
a
rush
but
when
the
door
went
down
at
last
in
a
mess
of
splinters
there
was
no
rush
nothing
but
silence
a
dark
square
stone
room
containing
two
cots
and
a
table
and
fruit
scattered
all
over
the
floor
amid
gray
dust
and
fragments
of
cement
grim
laughed
curtly
look
sir
the
were
on
the
floor
by
one
of
the
cots
and
the
tnt
containers
were
still
in
them
they
had
tipped
out
the
fruit
and
then
run
at
the
sound
of
the
battering
ram
goodenough
stepped
into
the
room
and
we
followed
him
beyond
the
table
by
a
great
stone
slab
was
a
dark
hole
in
the
floor
evidently
the
last
man
through
had
tried
to
cover
up
the
hole
but
had
found
the
stone
too
heavy
the
sikhs
dragged
it
clear
and
disclosed
the
mouth
of
a
tunnel
rather
less
than
a
man
height
sloping
sharply
downward
what
we
need
now
is
mustard
gas
smoke
out
said
goodenough
might
kill
grim
objected
that
be
too
bad
would
it
we
could
starve
out
for
that
matter
said
grim
but
they
probably
got
water
down
there
and
perhaps
food
every
hour
of
delay
adds
to
the
risk
of
rioting
we
got
to
get
this
hole
sealed
up
permanently
and
deny
that
it
was
ever
opened
we
could
do
that
at
once
but
i
wo
be
a
party
to
sealing
up
alive
besides
sir
they
certainly
got
firearms
and
they
might
just
possible
have
one
can
of
tnt
down
there
all
right
said
goodenough
i
lead
the
way
down
i
a
plan
said
grim
he
took
one
of
the
and
began
breaking
it
up
who
has
a
white
shirt
he
asked
i
was
the
haberdasher
the
others
sikhs
included
were
all
clothed
in
khaki
from
coat
to
skin
grim
bedouin
array
was
i
peeled
the
shirt
off
and
grim
rigged
it
on
a
frame
of
with
a
clumsy
arrangement
of
withes
at
the
bottom
the
idea
was
not
obvious
until
he
twisted
the
withes
about
his
waist
then
when
he
bent
down
the
shirt
stood
up
erect
above
him
if
you
do
mind
sir
we
have
two
or
three
sikhs
go
first
have
them
take
their
boots
off
and
crawl
quietly
as
flat
down
as
they
can
keep
i
follow
with
this
contraption
be
able
to
see
the
white
shirt
dimly
against
the
tunnel
and
if
they
do
any
shooting
they
aim
at
that
then
if
the
rest
of
you
keep
low
behind
me
we
a
good
chance
to
rush
them
before
they
can
do
any
damage
i
never
met
a
commanding
officer
more
free
from
personal
conceit
than
goodenough
and
as
i
came
to
know
more
of
him
later
on
that
characteristic
stood
out
increasingly
he
was
not
so
much
a
man
of
ideas
as
one
who
could
recognize
them
that
done
he
made
use
of
his
authority
to
back
up
his
subordinates
claiming
no
credit
for
himself
but
always
seeing
to
it
that
they
got
theirs
the
result
was
that
he
was
simultaneously
despised
and
loved
despised
by
the
school
of
which
there
are
plenty
in
every
army
and
loved
with
something
like
fanaticism
by
his
junior
officers
and
men
i
agree
to
that
he
said
simply
screwing
in
his
monocle
then
he
turned
and
instructed
the
sikhs
in
their
own
language
you
follow
last
he
said
to
me
now
all
ready
he
had
a
pistol
in
one
hand
and
a
flashlight
in
the
other
but
had
to
stow
them
both
away
again
in
order
to
crawl
in
the
tunnel
grim
had
no
weapon
in
sight
the
two
sikhs
who
were
to
lead
had
stripped
themselves
of
everything
that
might
make
a
noise
but
the
others
kept
both
boots
and
rifles
with
bayonets
fixed
for
it
did
not
much
matter
what
racket
they
made
in
fact
the
more
noise
we
who
followed
made
the
better
since
that
would
draw
attention
from
the
sikhs
in
front
all
we
had
to
do
was
to
keep
our
bodies
below
grim
kite
affair
out
of
the
probable
line
of
fire
nevertheless
that
dark
hole
was
untempting
a
dank
smell
came
out
of
it
like
the
breath
of
those
old
egyptian
tombs
in
which
the
bones
of
horses
buried
with
their
masters
lie
all
about
on
shelves
you
could
see
into
it
more
than
a
yard
or
two
for
the
only
light
came
through
the
doorway
of
the
windowless
room
and
the
tunnel
led
into
the
womb
of
rock
where
perhaps
no
light
had
been
since
solomon
day
but
the
leading
sikhs
went
in
without
hesitation
and
got
down
on
their
bellies
they
might
have
been
swallowed
whole
for
all
that
i
heard
or
saw
of
them
from
that
minute
you
could
guess
why
the
turks
and
germans
had
not
really
craved
to
meet
those
fellows
out
in
grim
went
in
on
like
a
weird
animal
with
my
shirt
dancing
on
its
frame
above
his
back
goodenough
went
next
peering
through
that
monocle
like
a
fish
all
the
rest
of
the
sikhs
went
after
him
in
indian
file
dragging
their
along
the
tunnel
floor
and
making
noise
enough
to
remind
you
of
the
new
york
subway
i
went
in
at
the
tail
end
trying
at
intervals
to
peer
around
a
punjaub
rump
alternately
getting
my
head
and
fingers
bruised
by
heels
i
could
not
see
and
a
that
only
moved
in
jerks
when
you
did
expect
it
to
my
nose
was
bleeding
at
the
end
of
ten
yards
but
you
could
keep
your
distance
whenever
the
men
in
front
checked
at
some
obstruction
or
paused
to
listen
all
those
behind
closed
up
and
by
the
time
those
behind
had
run
their
noses
against
heels
the
men
in
front
were
on
their
way
again
you
could
see
a
thing
until
you
rammed
your
head
into
it
and
then
the
sense
of
touch
gave
you
a
sort
of
sight
suggestion
as
when
you
see
things
in
a
dream
as
for
sound
the
tunnel
acted
like
a
whispering
gallery
mixing
all
the
noises
up
together
so
that
you
could
not
guess
whether
a
man
had
spoken
or
a
stone
had
fallen
or
a
pistol
had
gone
off
or
all
three
once
or
twice
when
the
line
closed
up
on
itself
fashion
i
was
able
to
make
out
my
white
shirt
dancing
dimly
and
once
where
some
trick
of
the
tunnel
sorted
out
the
sounds
i
caught
a
scrap
of
conversation
suppose
they
be
able
to
see
the
shirt
god
knows
i
can
hardly
make
it
out
from
here
when
it
looks
like
the
right
time
to
you
sir
turn
the
flashlight
on
it
all
right
god
damn
keep
on
going
you
nearly
knocked
out
my
even
over
my
shoulder
looking
backward
i
could
see
practically
nothing
for
what
little
light
came
in
through
the
opening
was
swallowed
by
the
first
few
yards
there
was
a
suspicion
of
paleness
in
the
gloom
behind
and
the
occasional
suggestion
of
an
outline
of
rough
wall
no
more
nor
was
the
tunnel
straight
by
any
means
it
turned
and
twisted
constantly
and
at
every
bend
the
men
who
originally
closed
it
had
built
up
a
wall
of
heavy
masonry
that
scharnhoff
had
had
to
force
his
way
through
in
those
places
the
broken
stones
were
now
lying
in
the
fairway
as
you
knew
by
the
suffering
when
you
came
in
contact
with
them
some
of
the
edges
were
as
sharp
as
glass
it
was
good
fun
all
the
same
while
it
lasted
if
we
had
been
crawling
down
a
sewer
or
a
modern
passage
of
any
kind
the
sense
of
danger
and
discomfort
would
no
doubt
have
overwhelmed
all
other
considerations
but
even
supposing
scharnhoff
had
been
on
a
vain
hunt
and
the
veritable
tomb
of
the
kings
of
judah
did
not
lie
somewhere
in
the
dark
ahead
of
us
we
were
nevertheless
under
the
foundations
of
solomon
temple
groping
our
way
into
mysteries
that
had
not
been
disclosed
perhaps
since
the
days
when
the
queen
of
sheba
came
and
paid
her
homage
to
the
most
wise
king
you
could
feel
afraid
but
you
could
wish
you
were
there
i
have
no
idea
how
long
it
took
to
crawl
the
length
of
that
black
passage
it
seemed
like
hours
i
heard
heavy
footsteps
behind
me
after
a
while
some
one
following
in
a
hurry
who
could
see
no
better
than
we
could
kept
stumbling
over
the
falling
masonry
and
once
when
he
fell
headlong
i
heard
him
swear
titanically
in
a
foreign
tongue
i
called
back
to
whoever
it
was
to
crawl
unless
he
wanted
to
be
shot
but
probably
the
words
were
all
mixed
up
in
the
tunnel
echoes
for
he
came
on
as
before
then
all
at
once
goodenough
flashed
on
the
light
for
a
fraction
of
a
second
and
the
shirt
showed
like
a
phantom
out
of
blackness
the
instant
answer
to
that
was
a
regular
volley
of
shots
from
in
front
the
flash
of
several
pistols
lit
up
the
tunnel
and
bullets
rattled
off
the
walls
and
roof
the
shirt
fell
shot
loose
from
its
moorings
and
the
leading
sikhs
gave
a
shout
as
they
started
to
rush
forward
we
all
surged
after
them
but
there
was
a
sudden
check
followed
by
a
babel
worse
than
when
a
dozen
fight
over
a
heap
you
could
make
head
or
tail
of
it
except
that
something
desperate
was
happening
in
front
until
suddenly
a
man
with
a
knife
in
his
hand
too
wild
with
fear
to
use
it
came
leaping
and
scrambling
over
the
backs
of
sikhs
like
a
forward
bucking
the
line
the
sikh
in
front
of
me
knelt
upright
and
collared
him
round
the
knees
the
two
went
down
together
i
on
top
of
both
of
them
with
blood
running
down
my
arm
for
the
man
had
started
to
use
his
knife
at
last
slashing
out
at
random
and
i
rather
think
that
slight
cut
he
gave
me
saved
the
sikh
life
but
you
can
make
any
kind
of
calculation
afterwards
about
what
took
place
in
absolute
darkness
without
the
least
fear
of
being
proven
wrong
and
since
the
sikh
and
i
agreed
on
that
point
no
other
opinion
matters
i
think
that
between
the
two
of
us
we
had
that
man
about
nonplused
although
we
could
see
i
had
his
knife
and
the
sikh
was
kneeling
on
his
stomach
when
a
hundred
and
eighty
pounds
of
bone
and
muscle
catapulted
at
us
from
the
rear
and
sprawled
on
us
headlong
saved
by
only
a
miracle
from
skewering
some
one
with
a
bayonet
as
he
fell
he
laughed
while
he
fought
this
newcomer
and
even
asked
questions
in
the
sikh
tongue
he
had
my
arm
in
a
grip
like
a
vise
and
wrenched
at
it
until
i
cursed
him
then
he
found
a
leg
in
the
dark
and
nearly
broke
that
only
to
discover
it
was
the
other
sikh
still
laughing
as
if
blindfolded
fighting
was
his
meat
and
drink
he
reached
again
and
this
time
his
fingers
closed
on
enemy
flesh
judging
by
the
yells
they
hurt
too
there
must
have
been
at
least
another
minute
of
struggling
hands
being
stepped
on
and
throats
clutched
before
goodenough
rolled
himself
free
from
an
antagonist
in
front
and
groping
for
the
flashlight
found
it
and
flashed
it
on
the
first
thing
i
recognized
by
its
light
was
the
face
of
narayan
singh
with
wonderful
white
teeth
grinning
through
his
black
beard
within
six
inches
of
my
nose
damn
you
i
laughed
you
weigh
a
ton
get
off
you
nearly
killed
me
nearly
in
means
a
whole
new
life
to
lose
sahib
be
pleased
to
make
the
most
of
it
he
answered
within
two
minutes
after
that
we
had
eight
prisoners
disarmed
and
subdued
some
of
them
rather
the
worse
for
battery
the
amazing
thing
was
that
we
had
a
serious
casualty
among
the
lot
of
us
we
could
have
totaled
a
square
yard
of
skin
no
doubt
and
a
bushel
of
bruises
if
that
is
the
way
you
measure
them
but
mine
was
the
only
i
felt
beastly
proud
by
the
light
of
the
electric
torch
we
dragged
and
prodded
the
prisoners
back
whence
they
had
come
and
presently
grim
or
somebody
found
a
lantern
and
lit
it
we
found
ourselves
in
a
square
cavern
a
perfect
cube
it
looked
like
about
thirty
feet
wide
each
way
in
the
midst
was
a
plain
stone
coffer
with
its
lid
removed
and
set
on
end
against
it
in
the
coffer
lay
a
tall
man
skeleton
with
the
chin
still
bound
in
linen
browned
with
age
there
were
other
fragments
of
linen
here
and
there
but
the
skeleton
bones
had
been
disturbed
and
had
fallen
more
or
less
apart
over
in
one
corner
were
two
large
bundles
done
up
in
modern
bags
and
grim
went
over
to
examine
them
hello
he
said
here
scharnhoff
and
his
lady
friend
he
ripped
the
lashings
of
both
bundles
and
disclosed
the
austrian
and
the
woman
gagged
and
tied
both
almost
unconscious
from
inability
to
breathe
but
not
much
hurt
otherwise
the
sikhs
herded
the
prisoners
old
among
them
into
another
corner
grim
tore
my
shirt
into
strips
to
bandage
my
arm
with
goodenough
talked
with
narayan
singh
while
we
waited
for
scharnhoff
to
recover
full
consciousness
those
murderers
he
gasped
at
last
schweinehunde
better
spill
the
beans
old
boy
grim
said
smiling
down
at
him
you
hang
at
the
same
time
they
do
if
you
ca
tell
a
straight
story
ach
i
do
not
care
there
were
no
manuscripts
nothing
i
do
know
whose
skeleton
that
is
some
old
king
david
perhaps
for
that
is
not
david
real
tomb
that
the
guides
show
hang
those
murderers
and
i
am
satisfied
your
story
may
help
hang
them
come
on
out
with
it
have
you
caught
noureddin
ali
never
mind
but
i
do
mind
and
you
should
mind
scharnhoff
sat
up
excitedly
he
was
dressed
in
the
arab
garments
i
had
seen
in
his
cupboard
that
day
when
grim
and
i
called
on
him
with
a
scholar
turban
that
made
him
look
very
distinguished
in
spite
of
his
disarray
that
noureddin
ali
is
a
devil
together
we
would
look
for
the
tomb
of
the
kings
together
we
would
smuggle
out
the
manuscripts
translate
them
together
publish
the
result
together
he
lent
me
money
he
promised
to
bring
explosives
oh
he
was
full
of
enthusiasm
it
was
not
until
last
night
when
i
had
broken
that
last
obstruction
down
and
discovered
nothing
but
this
coffin
that
i
learned
his
real
plan
the
devil
intended
all
along
to
fill
this
tomb
with
high
explosive
and
to
destroy
the
mosque
above
with
everybody
in
it
curse
him
never
mind
cursing
him
said
grim
tell
us
the
story
he
sent
oranges
here
all
marked
with
the
labels
of
a
zionist
colony
when
i
told
him
that
the
explosive
would
arrive
too
late
he
said
i
should
use
it
to
smash
these
walls
and
find
another
tomb
he
himself
disappeared
and
when
i
questioned
his
men
they
told
me
the
explosive
would
be
brought
in
hidden
under
fruit
in
baskets
i
waited
then
in
the
hope
of
killing
him
myself
laughed
grim
that
is
true
but
they
bound
me
and
later
on
bound
the
woman
and
laid
us
here
to
be
blown
up
together
with
the
mosque
grim
turned
to
goodenough
who
had
been
listening
do
i
win
the
bet
sir
ten
piastoes
said
goodenough
yes
narayan
singh
says
noureddin
ali
was
gone
by
the
time
they
reached
the
wall
sure
or
he
have
brought
noureddin
ali
i
been
thinking
sir
we
one
chance
left
to
bag
that
buzzard
will
you
give
me
carte
blanche
yes
go
ahead
grim
crossed
the
place
to
the
corner
where
old
stood
herded
with
the
other
prisoners
are
you
guilty
he
demanded
no
guilty
of
nothing
i
came
out
of
curiosity
to
see
what
was
happening
here
thought
so
can
you
hold
your
tongue
then
go
get
out
of
here
did
wait
for
a
second
urging
nor
stay
to
question
his
good
luck
but
went
off
in
a
shambling
hurry
you
are
mad
exclaimed
scharnhoff
that
man
is
the
grim
are
you
sure
that
wise
asked
goodenough
we
can
get
him
any
time
we
want
him
sir
grim
answered
he
lacks
noureddin
ali
gift
of
slipperiness
he
turned
to
narayan
singh
follow
that
man
but
do
let
him
know
he
followed
show
you
where
noureddin
ali
is
get
him
this
time
dead
or
alive
sahib
either
chapter
twenty
all
men
are
equal
in
the
dark
the
first
thing
goodenough
did
after
grim
had
sent
narayan
singh
off
on
his
deadly
mission
was
to
summon
the
sheikh
of
the
dome
of
the
rock
he
himself
went
to
fetch
him
rather
than
risk
having
the
sheikh
bring
a
crowd
of
witnesses
who
would
be
sure
to
talk
afterwards
the
thing
was
to
conceal
the
fact
that
sacrilege
had
been
committed
but
it
was
also
necessary
to
establish
the
fact
that
zionists
had
had
no
hand
in
it
you
see
grim
explained
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
stone
coffin
we
could
hold
jerusalem
but
if
word
of
this
business
were
to
spread
far
and
wide
you
could
hold
two
or
three
hundred
million
fanatics
and
believe
me
they
cut
loose
the
sheikh
must
realize
that
said
i
what
do
you
bet
me
he
wo
try
to
the
administration
on
the
strength
of
it
i
bet
you
my
job
watch
the
old
bird
listen
in
downy
he
knows
a
chance
when
he
sees
it
and
he
might
try
to
cheat
you
at
dominoes
but
in
a
big
crisis
he
a
number
one
man
while
we
waited
we
tried
to
get
an
opinion
out
of
scharnhoff
about
the
coffin
and
the
skeleton
inside
it
but
the
old
fellow
was
i
think
he
told
the
truth
when
he
said
he
could
explain
it
what
is
there
to
say
of
it
except
that
it
is
very
ancient
there
is
no
decoration
the
coffin
is
beautifully
shaped
out
of
one
solid
piece
of
stone
but
that
is
all
the
skeleton
is
that
of
an
old
man
who
seems
to
have
been
wounded
once
or
twice
in
battle
the
linen
is
good
but
there
is
no
jewelry
no
ornaments
and
it
is
buried
here
in
a
very
sacred
place
so
probably
it
is
one
of
the
jewish
kings
or
else
one
of
the
prophets
it
might
be
king
david
who
knows
and
what
do
i
care
it
is
what
a
man
sets
down
on
parchment
and
not
his
bones
that
interest
me
the
sheikh
arrived
at
last
following
goodenough
down
the
dark
passage
with
the
supreme
nonchalance
of
the
priest
too
long
familiar
with
sacred
places
to
be
thrilled
or
frightened
by
them
he
stood
in
the
entrance
gazing
about
him
blinking
speculatively
through
the
folds
of
fat
surrounding
his
bright
eyes
goodenough
took
the
lantern
and
held
it
close
to
the
prisoners
faces
one
by
one
you
see
he
said
all
syrians
all
moslems
not
a
jew
among
them
i
take
you
and
show
you
the
others
presently
what
will
you
do
with
them
that
for
a
court
to
decide
hang
them
most
likely
they
were
plotting
murder
they
will
talk
at
the
trial
behind
closed
doors
said
goodenough
ahum
said
the
sheikh
stroking
his
beard
it
would
not
have
been
compatible
with
either
his
religion
or
his
racial
consciousness
not
to
try
to
make
the
utmost
of
the
situation
this
would
be
a
bad
thing
for
all
the
christian
governments
if
the
tale
leaked
out
religious
places
have
been
desecrated
there
would
be
inflammation
of
moslem
prejudices
everywhere
it
would
be
worse
for
you
grim
retorted
the
sheikh
stared
hard
at
him
stroking
his
beard
again
how
so
jimgrim
have
i
had
a
hand
in
this
this
is
your
famous
where
as
you
tell
your
faithful
the
souls
of
the
dead
come
to
pray
twice
a
week
this
is
the
gulf
beneath
the
rock
of
abraham
that
you
tell
them
reaches
to
the
middle
of
the
world
look
at
it
shall
we
publish
flashlight
photographs
the
sheikh
eyes
twinkled
as
he
recognized
the
force
of
that
argument
he
turned
it
over
in
his
mind
for
a
full
minute
before
he
answered
you
can
not
be
expected
to
understand
spiritual
things
he
said
at
last
however
looking
up
this
is
not
under
the
rock
this
is
another
place
goodenough
pulled
a
compass
from
his
pocket
but
grim
shook
his
head
go
on
said
grim
what
of
it
it
is
better
to
close
up
this
place
and
say
nothing
except
this
goodenough
retorted
you
will
say
at
the
first
and
every
succeeding
opportunity
that
you
know
it
is
not
true
that
zionists
tried
to
blow
up
the
dome
of
the
rock
how
do
i
know
they
did
not
try
perhaps
we
better
ask
the
administrator
to
come
and
inspect
this
place
officially
and
put
the
exact
facts
on
the
record
goodenough
retorted
you
understand
do
you
said
grim
everything
we
done
until
now
has
been
strictly
unofficial
there
a
difference
and
this
effendi
he
asked
staring
at
me
what
of
him
he
is
commended
to
your
special
benevolence
grim
answered
the
way
to
keep
a
man
like
him
discreet
is
to
make
a
friend
of
him
treat
him
as
you
do
me
then
we
three
shall
be
friends
the
sheikh
nodded
and
that
proved
to
be
the
beginning
of
a
rather
intimate
acquaintance
with
him
that
stood
me
in
good
stead
more
than
once
afterwards
the
influence
that
a
man
in
his
position
can
exert
if
he
cares
to
is
almost
beyond
the
belief
of
those
who
pin
their
faith
to
money
and
mere
officialdom
the
prisoners
were
marched
out
all
except
scharnhoff
and
the
woman
were
confirmed
temporarily
in
the
room
in
which
grim
and
i
had
breakfasted
the
woman
was
taken
to
the
jail
until
an
american
missionary
could
be
found
to
take
charge
of
her
they
always
hand
the
awkward
cases
over
to
americans
partly
because
they
have
a
gift
for
that
sort
of
thing
but
also
because
in
case
of
need
you
can
blame
americans
without
much
risk
of
a
reaction
goodenough
left
a
guard
of
sikhs
outside
the
street
entrance
to
keep
out
all
intruders
until
the
sheikh
could
collect
a
few
trustworthy
masons
to
seal
up
the
passage
again
grim
scharnhoff
and
i
walked
quite
leisurely
to
grim
quarters
where
grim
left
the
two
of
us
together
in
the
room
downstairs
while
he
changed
into
uniform
what
will
they
do
with
me
asked
scharnhoff
he
was
not
far
from
collapse
he
lay
back
in
the
armchair
with
his
mouth
open
i
got
him
some
of
grim
whiskey
nothing
ungenerous
i
said
if
you
were
going
to
be
hanged
grim
would
have
told
you
do
you
do
you
think
he
will
let
me
go
not
until
he
through
with
you
said
i
if
i
any
judge
of
him
what
use
can
i
be
to
him
my
life
is
not
worth
a
purchase
if
noureddin
ali
finds
me
he
or
that
other
whom
they
let
go
oh
what
idiots
to
let
noureddin
ali
give
them
the
slip
and
then
to
turn
the
one
loose
as
well
those
english
are
all
mad
that
man
grim
has
been
corrupted
by
them
grim
hardly
looked
corrupted
rather
and
energetic
when
he
returned
presently
in
his
major
uniform
you
could
tell
the
color
of
his
eyes
now
they
were
and
there
was
a
light
in
them
that
should
warn
the
wary
not
to
oppose
him
unless
a
real
fight
was
wanted
his
manner
was
brisk
brusk
striding
over
trifles
he
nodded
to
me
you
sick
of
this
he
asked
me
how
many
times
i
want
to
see
it
through
all
right
your
own
risk
he
turned
on
scharnhoff
standing
straight
in
front
of
him
with
both
arms
behind
his
back
look
here
have
you
any
decency
in
that
body
of
yours
do
you
want
to
prove
it
or
would
you
rather
hang
like
a
common
scoundrel
which
is
it
to
be
i
i
i
i
do
not
understand
you
what
do
you
mean
are
you
game
to
risk
your
neck
decently
or
would
you
rather
have
the
hangman
put
you
out
of
pain
i
i
was
not
a
conspirator
major
grim
if
i
had
known
what
they
intended
i
would
never
have
lent
myself
to
such
a
purpose
i
needed
money
for
my
excavations
it
has
been
very
difficult
to
draw
on
my
bank
in
vienna
noureddin
ali
represented
himself
to
me
as
an
enthusiastic
antiquarian
and
when
i
spoke
of
my
need
he
offered
money
as
i
told
you
already
i
never
suspected
until
last
night
that
he
and
abdul
ali
of
damascus
are
french
secret
agents
but
last
night
he
boasted
to
me
about
abdul
ali
he
laughed
at
me
then
he
yes
yes
grim
interrupted
will
you
play
the
man
now
if
i
give
you
the
chance
if
you
will
accord
me
opportunity
at
least
i
will
do
my
best
understand
you
not
be
allowed
to
live
here
afterward
you
be
repatriated
to
austria
or
wherever
you
come
from
all
you
offered
is
a
chance
to
clean
your
slate
morally
before
you
go
i
shall
be
grateful
will
you
obey
absolutely
to
the
limit
of
my
power
that
is
to
say
i
am
not
an
athlete
not
a
man
of
active
habits
very
well
listen
grim
turned
to
me
again
take
scharnhoff
to
his
house
you
know
the
way
when
afternoon
comes
set
a
table
in
the
garden
and
let
him
sit
at
it
he
may
as
well
read
if
nothing
happens
before
dark
take
him
out
a
lamp
and
some
food
he
must
move
away
he
better
change
into
his
proper
clothes
first
your
job
will
be
to
keep
an
eye
on
him
until
i
come
you
better
keep
out
of
sight
as
much
as
possible
especially
after
dark
better
watch
him
through
the
window
and
by
the
way
take
this
pistol
if
scharnhoff
disobeys
you
shoot
him
he
turned
again
on
scharnhoff
i
hope
you
not
fooling
yourself
i
should
say
the
chance
is
two
or
three
to
one
that
you
come
out
of
this
alive
if
you
killed
you
may
flatter
yourself
that
a
mighty
sight
cleaner
than
hanging
if
you
come
out
with
a
whole
skin
you
shall
leave
the
country
without
even
going
to
jail
time
to
go
now
i
slipped
the
heavy
pistol
into
my
pocket
and
led
the
way
without
saying
a
word
scharnhoff
followed
me
rather
drearily
and
we
walked
side
by
side
toward
the
german
colony
he
looking
exactly
like
one
of
those
respectable
and
devout
educated
arabs
of
the
old
style
who
teach
from
commentaries
on
the
koran
we
excited
no
comment
whatever
what
will
he
do
what
is
his
purpose
scharnhoff
asked
me
after
a
while
if
a
man
is
in
danger
of
death
he
likes
to
know
the
reason
the
purpose
of
it
i
had
a
better
than
faint
glimmering
of
grim
purpose
but
saw
no
necessity
to
air
my
views
on
the
subject
i
amused
said
i
at
the
strictly
unofficial
status
of
all
this
you
see
i
no
more
connected
with
this
administration
than
you
are
i
as
alien
as
you
you
might
say
i
a
stranger
in
jerusalem
yet
here
i
am
with
a
perfectly
official
pistol
loaded
with
official
cartridges
under
unofficial
orders
to
shoot
you
at
the
first
sign
of
disobedience
and
strictly
unofficially
between
you
and
me
i
sha
hesitate
to
do
it
he
contrived
a
smile
out
of
the
depths
of
his
despondency
i
wonder
should
you
shoot
me
what
they
would
do
to
you
afterwards
something
unofficial
i
suggested
but
we
leave
that
up
to
them
the
point
is
oh
do
worry
you
shall
have
no
trouble
from
me
it
took
a
long
time
to
reach
his
house
for
the
poor
old
chap
was
suffering
from
lack
of
sleep
and
physical
weariness
as
well
as
disappointment
and
i
had
to
let
him
sit
down
by
the
wayside
once
or
twice
being
in
hard
condition
and
not
much
more
than
half
his
age
i
had
almost
forgotten
that
i
had
not
slept
the
night
before
keen
curiosity
as
to
what
might
happen
between
now
and
midnight
was
keeping
me
going
he
could
hardly
drag
himself
into
the
house
but
a
bath
and
some
food
that
i
found
in
the
larder
restored
him
considerably
he
helped
me
carry
out
the
table
he
chose
a
book
of
poems
to
take
with
him
but
did
not
read
it
he
sat
with
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
his
back
toward
the
front
door
resting
his
chin
gloomily
on
both
fists
he
remained
in
that
attitude
all
afternoon
and
for
all
i
know
slept
part
of
the
time
between
him
and
the
window
of
the
room
i
sat
in
were
some
shrubs
that
obscured
the
view
considerably
i
could
see
scharnhoff
through
them
easily
enough
but
i
do
think
he
could
see
me
and
certainly
no
one
could
have
seen
me
from
the
road
i
felt
fairly
sure
that
no
one
saw
me
until
it
began
to
grow
dark
and
i
carried
out
the
lamp
even
then
it
was
scharnhoff
who
struck
the
match
and
lit
it
so
that
i
was
in
shadow
all
the
time
probably
unrecognizable
it
had
been
fairly
easy
to
keep
awake
until
then
but
as
the
room
grew
darker
and
darker
and
nothing
happened
the
yearning
to
fall
asleep
became
actual
agony
it
was
a
rather
large
square
room
crowded
up
with
a
jumble
of
antiquities
the
only
real
furniture
was
the
on
which
i
knelt
and
an
oblong
table
but
even
the
table
was
laid
on
its
side
to
make
room
for
a
battered
roman
bust
standing
on
the
floor
between
its
legs
i
had
left
the
door
of
the
room
wide
open
in
order
to
be
able
to
hear
anything
that
might
happen
in
the
house
but
the
only
sound
came
from
a
couple
of
rats
that
gnawed
and
rustled
interminably
among
the
rubbish
in
the
corner
it
must
have
been
nearly
eight
and
i
believe
i
had
actually
dozed
off
at
last
kneeling
in
the
window
when
all
at
once
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
rats
were
making
a
different
and
greater
noise
than
i
ever
heard
rats
make
it
was
dark
i
could
see
my
hand
in
front
of
me
my
first
thought
was
to
glance
through
the
window
at
scharnhoff
but
something
intuition
i
suppose
made
me
draw
aside
from
the
window
instead
then
beyond
any
shadow
of
a
doubt
i
heard
a
man
move
and
the
hair
rose
all
up
the
back
of
my
head
i
remembered
the
pistol
clutched
it
and
found
voice
enough
for
two
words
who
there
came
the
answer
from
behind
the
table
so
major
jimgrim
lied
about
a
broken
leg
and
thought
to
trap
noureddin
ali
did
he
do
move
major
jimgrim
do
move
we
will
have
a
little
talk
before
we
bid
each
other
i
can
not
last
long
in
any
case
for
the
cursed
sikhs
are
after
me
i
would
rather
that
you
should
kill
me
than
those
sikhs
should
but
i
would
like
to
kill
you
also
if
you
move
before
i
give
you
leave
you
are
a
dead
man
major
jimgrim
you
can
not
see
me
better
keep
still
if
it
was
flattering
to
be
mistaken
for
grim
in
the
dark
it
was
hardly
pleasant
in
the
circumstances
for
a
moment
i
was
angry
it
flashed
across
my
mind
that
grim
had
planned
this
but
on
second
thought
i
refused
to
believe
he
would
deceive
me
about
scharnhoff
and
use
me
as
a
decoy
without
my
permission
i
decided
to
keep
still
and
see
what
happened
do
you
think
you
deserve
to
live
major
jimgrim
noureddin
ali
voice
went
on
i
heard
him
shift
his
position
he
was
probably
trying
to
see
my
outline
against
the
dark
wall
in
order
to
take
aim
you
a
foreigner
interfering
in
the
politics
of
this
land
but
for
you
there
would
have
been
an
explosion
today
that
would
have
liberated
all
the
moslem
world
but
for
that
lie
about
a
broken
leg
you
would
have
died
a
little
after
ten
this
morning
instead
of
now
do
move
major
jimgrim
you
and
i
will
have
a
duel
presently
there
is
lots
of
time
the
sikhs
lost
track
of
me
i
did
move
i
stooped
down
close
to
the
floor
so
that
he
might
fire
over
my
head
if
as
i
suspected
he
was
merely
gaining
time
in
order
to
take
sure
aim
i
tried
to
see
which
end
of
the
table
he
was
talking
from
but
he
was
hidden
completely
do
you
think
you
should
go
free
to
perpetrate
more
cowardly
interference
after
spoiling
that
plan
you
poor
fool
such
as
you
invariably
overreach
themselves
having
tricked
me
two
or
three
times
you
thought
did
you
that
you
could
draw
me
here
to
kill
scharnhoff
that
poor
old
sheep
you
were
careful
were
you
to
let
omar
mahmoud
go
in
order
that
he
might
tell
me
how
scharnhoff
had
turned
witness
against
us
and
the
sikhs
followed
omar
mahmoud
until
omar
mahmoud
found
me
and
then
they
hunted
me
do
move
was
that
the
plan
simultaneously
then
being
yourself
only
a
fool
after
all
you
flatter
me
and
underestimate
my
intelligence
you
were
right
in
thinking
i
would
not
submit
to
capture
and
death
without
first
wreaking
vengeance
but
vengeance
on
such
a
sheep
as
scharnhoff
with
major
jimgrim
still
alive
what
possessed
you
were
you
mad
i
satisfied
myself
an
hour
ago
that
scharnhoff
was
the
bait
which
the
redoubtable
major
jimgrim
would
be
watching
perhaps
i
shall
deal
with
scharnhoff
afterwards
who
knows
now
now
shall
we
fight
that
duel
are
you
ready
i
supposed
that
meant
that
he
could
not
see
me
and
had
given
up
hope
of
it
he
would
like
to
have
me
move
first
so
as
to
judge
my
exact
whereabouts
by
sound
i
reached
out
very
cautiously
and
rapped
the
muzzle
of
my
pistol
on
the
floor
twice
he
fired
instantly
three
shots
in
succession
the
bullets
went
wild
to
my
left
and
brought
down
showers
of
plaster
from
the
wall
i
feared
he
might
have
seen
me
by
the
i
did
not
fire
back
there
was
no
need
something
moved
swiftly
like
a
black
ghost
through
the
open
door
there
was
a
thud
and
the
ring
of
a
steel
swivel
and
a
scream
has
the
sahib
a
match
said
a
gruff
voice
that
i
thought
i
recognized
i
was
trembling
excitement
of
course
only
children
and
women
and
foreigners
ever
feel
afraid
it
took
me
half
a
minute
to
find
the
match
box
and
the
other
half
to
strike
a
light
narayan
singh
was
standing
by
the
end
of
the
table
he
was
wiping
blood
off
his
bayonet
with
a
piece
of
newspaper
he
looked
cool
enough
to
have
carried
the
paper
in
his
pocket
for
that
purpose
i
got
up
feeling
ashamed
to
be
seen
crouching
on
the
floor
but
narayan
singh
smiled
approval
you
did
well
sahib
all
men
are
equal
in
the
dark
until
he
fired
first
there
was
nothing
wise
to
do
but
hide
how
long
have
you
been
here
i
asked
five
minutes
i
only
waited
for
a
sure
thrust
but
hah
the
sahib
feels
like
a
dead
man
come
to
life
again
eh
well
i
know
that
feeling
the
match
burned
my
fingers
i
struck
another
as
i
did
that
grim
stood
in
the
doorway
smiling
is
he
dead
he
asked
surely
sahib
shall
i
go
now
and
get
that
other
one
that
omar
mahmoud
no
need
said
grim
they
rounded
him
up
five
minutes
after
he
had
found
noureddin
then
have
i
done
all
that
was
required
of
me
no
narayan
singh
you
have
shaken
hands
with
me
yet
thank
you
jimgrim
the
match
went
out
i
struck
a
third
one
grim
turned
to
me
hungry
sleepy
oh
to
hell
with
sleep
let
bring
old
scharnhoff
into
the
other
room
dig
out
some
eats
and
drinks
and
get
a
story
from
him
all
right
narayan
singh
there
be
a
guard
here
in
ten
minutes
to
take
charge
of
that
body
after
that
dismiss
i
report
you
to
colonel
goodenough
for
being
a
damned
good
soldier
my
colonel
sahib
knew
that
years
ago
the
great
sikh
answered
quietly
