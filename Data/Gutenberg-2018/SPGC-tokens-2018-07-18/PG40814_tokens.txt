preface
to
the
reader
i
present
you
with
my
first
continuous
story
i
do
not
dignify
it
by
the
name
of
a
novel
i
am
aware
that
it
is
entirely
at
variance
with
all
set
rules
for
there
is
no
intricate
plot
there
are
no
startling
developments
no
escapes
i
have
compressed
into
one
volume
what
i
might
have
expanded
into
two
or
three
i
have
avoided
long
introductions
and
descriptions
and
have
entered
unceremoniously
and
unannounced
into
people
houses
without
stopping
to
ring
the
bell
whether
you
will
fancy
this
primitive
mode
of
calling
whether
you
will
like
the
company
to
which
it
introduces
you
or
whether
you
will
like
the
book
at
all
i
can
not
tell
still
i
cherish
the
hope
that
somewhere
in
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
land
it
may
fan
into
a
flame
in
some
tried
heart

fading
embers

chapter
i
the
old
church
clock
rang
solemnly
out
on
the
midnight
air
ruth
started
for
hours
she
had
sat
there
leaning
her
cheek
upon
her
hand
and
gazing
through
the
open
space
between
the
rows
of
brick
walls
upon
the
sparkling
waters
of
the
bay
glancing
and
quivering
the
the
city
busy
hum
had
long
since
died
away
myriad
restless
eyes
had
closed
in
peaceful
slumber
ruth
could
not
sleep
this
was
the
last
time
she
would
sit
at
that
little
window
the
morrow
would
find
her
in
a
home
of
her
own
on
the
morrow
ruth
would
be
a
bride
ruth
was
not
sighing
because
she
was
about
to
leave
her
father
roof
for
her
childhood
had
been
anything
but
happy
but
she
was
vainly
trying
to
look
into
a
future
which
god
has
mercifully
veiled
from
curious
eyes
had
that
craving
heart
of
her
at
length
found
its
ark
of
refuge
would
clouds
or
sunshine
joy
or
sorrow
tears
or
smiles
predominate
in
her
future
who
could
tell
the
silent
stars
returned
her
no
answer
would
a
harsh
word
ever
fall
from
lips
which
now
breathed
only
love
would
the
step
whose
lightest
footfall
now
made
her
heart
leap
ever
sound
in
her
ear
like
a
as
time
with
its
ceaseless
changes
rolled
on
would
love
flee
affrighted
from
the
bent
form
and
silver
locks
and
faltering
footstep
was
there
no
talisman
to
keep
him
strange
questions
were
they
for
a
young
girl
ah
but
ruth
could
remember
when
she
was
no
taller
than
a
rosebush
how
cravingly
her
little
heart
cried
out
for
love
how
a
careless
word
powerless
to
wound
one
less
sensitive
would
send
her
weeping
to
that
little
room
for
hours
and
young
as
she
was
life
pains
seemed
already
more
to
her
than
life
pleasures
would
it
be
so
would
she
find
more
thorns
than
roses
in
her
pathway
then
ruth
remembered
how
she
used
to
wish
she
were
beautiful
not
that
she
might
be
admired
but
that
she
might
be
loved
but
ruth
was
very
plain
so
her
brother
hyacinth
told
her
and
awkward
too
she
had
heard
that
ever
since
she
could
remember
and
the
recollection
of
it
dyed
her
cheek
with
blushes
whenever
a
stranger
made
his
appearance
in
the
home
circle
so
ruth
was
fonder
of
being
alone
by
herself
and
then
they
called
her
odd
and
queer
and
wondered
if
she
would
ever
make
anything
and
ruth
used
to
wonder
too
and
sometimes
she
asked
herself
why
a
sweet
strain
of
music
or
a
fine
passage
in
a
poem
made
her
heart
thrill
and
her
whole
frame
quiver
with
emotion
the
world
smiled
on
her
brother
hyacinth
he
was
handsome
and
gifted
he
could
win
fame
and
what
was
better
love
ruth
wished
he
would
love
her
a
little
she
often
used
to
steal
into
his
room
and
right
his
papers
when
the
stupid
housemaid
had
displaced
them
and
often
she
would
prepare
him
a
tempting
little
lunch
and
carry
it
to
his
room
on
his
return
from
his
morning
walk
but
hyacinth
would
only
say
oh
it
is
you
ruth
is
it
i
thought
it
was
bridget
and
go
on
reading
his
newspaper
ruth
mother
was
dead
ruth
did
not
remember
a
great
deal
about
her
only
that
she
always
looked
uneasy
about
the
time
her
father
was
expected
home
and
when
his
step
was
heard
in
the
hall
she
would
say
in
a
whisper
to
hyacinth
and
herself
hush
hush
your
father
is
coming
and
then
hyacinth
would
immediately
stop
whistling
or
humming
and
ruth
would
run
up
into
her
little
room
for
fear
she
should
in
some
unexpected
way
get
into
disgrace
ruth
also
remembered
when
her
father
came
home
and
found
company
to
tea
how
he
frowned
and
complained
of
headache
although
he
always
ate
as
heartily
as
any
of
the
company
and
how
after
tea
he
would
stretch
himself
out
upon
the
sofa
and
say
i
think
i
take
a
nap
and
then
he
would
close
his
eyes
and
if
the
company
commenced
talking
he
would
start
up
and
say
to
ruth
who
was
sitting
very
still
in
the
corner
do
make
such
a
noise
and
when
ruth
mother
would
whisper
gently
in
his
ear
would
it
be
better
dear
if
you
laid
down
up
stairs
it
is
quite
comfortable
and
quiet
there
her
father
would
say
aloud
oh
yes
oh
yes
you
want
to
get
rid
of
me
do
you
and
then
her
mother
would
say
turning
to
the
company
how
very
fond
ellet
is
of
a
joke
but
ruth
remembered
that
her
mother
often
blushed
when
she
said
so
and
that
her
laugh
did
not
sound
natural
after
her
mother
death
ruth
was
sent
to
where
she
shared
a
room
with
four
strange
girls
who
laid
awake
all
night
telling
the
most
extraordinary
stories
and
ridiculing
ruth
for
being
such
an
old
maid
that
she
could
not
see
where
the
laugh
came
in
equally
astonishing
to
the
unsophisticated
ruth
was
the
demureness
with
which
they
would
bend
over
their
books
when
the
pale
widow
employed
as
duenna
went
the
rounds
after
tea
to
see
if
each
inmate
was
preparing
the
next
day
lessons
and
the
coolness
with
which
they
would
jump
up
on
her
departure
put
on
their
bonnets
and
shawls
and
slip
out
at
the
door
to
meet
expectant
lovers
and
when
the
pale
widow
went
the
rounds
again
at
nine
she
would
find
them
demurely
seated
just
where
she
left
them
apparently
busily
conning
their
lessons
ruth
wondered
if
girls
were
as
mischievous
and
if
fathers
and
mothers
ever
stopped
to
think
what
companions
their
daughters
would
have
for
and
when
they
sent
them
away
from
home
as
to
the
principal
madame
moreau
she
contented
herself
with
sweeping
her
flounces
once
a
day
through
the
recitation
rooms
so
it
was
not
a
difficult
matter
in
so
large
an
establishment
to
pass
muster
with
the
at
recitations
composition
day
was
the
general
bugbear
ruth
madcap
were
struck
with
the
most
unqualified
amazement
and
admiration
at
the
facility
with
which
the
old
maid
executed
this
frightful
task
they
soon
learned
to
put
her
services
in
requisition
first
to
help
them
out
of
this
slough
of
despond
next
to
save
them
the
necessity
of
wading
in
at
all
by
writing
their
compositions
for
them
in
the
love
affairs
which
were
constantly
going
on
between
the
young
ladies
of
madame
moreau
school
and
their
respective
admirers
ruth
took
no
interest
and
on
the
occasion
of
the
unexpected
reception
of
a
bouquet
from
a
smitten
swain
accompanied
by
a
copy
of
amatory
verses
ruth
crimsoned
to
her
temples
and
burst
into
tears
that
any
one
could
be
found
so
heartless
as
to
burlesque
the
awkward
ruth
simple
child
she
was
unconscious
that
in
the
freedom
of
that
atmosphere
where
a
prophet
out
of
his
own
country
is
honored
her
lithe
form
had
rounded
into
symmetry
and
grace
her
slow
step
had
become
light
and
elastic
her
eye
bright
her
smile
winning
and
her
voice
soft
and
melodious
other
bouquets
other
notes
and
glances
of
involuntary
admiration
from
at
length
opened
her
eyes
to
the
fact
that
she
was
plain
awkward
ruth
no
longer
eureka
she
had
arrived
at
the
first
epoch
in
a
young
girl
life
she
had
found
out
her
power
her
manners
became
assured
and
ruth
could
inspire
love
life
became
dear
to
her
there
was
something
worth
living
for
something
to
look
forward
to
she
had
a
motive
an
aim
she
should
day
make
somebody
heart
glad
somebody
bright
somebody
should
be
proud
of
her
and
oh
how
she
love
that
somebody
history
astronomy
mathematics
the
languages
were
all
pastime
now
life
wore
a
new
aspect
the
skies
were
bluer
the
earth
greener
the
flowers
more
fragrant
her
existed
somewhere
when
ruth
had
been
a
year
at
school
her
elegant
brother
hyacinth
came
to
see
her
ruth
dashed
down
her
books
and
bounded
down
three
stairs
at
a
time
to
meet
him
for
she
loved
him
poor
child
just
as
well
as
if
he
were
worth
loving
hyacinth
drew
languidly
back
a
dozen
paces
and
holding
up
his
hands
drawled
out
imploringly
kiss
me
if
you
insist
on
it
ruth
but
for
heaven
sake
do
tumble
my
dickey
he
also
remarked
that
her
shoes
were
too
large
for
her
feet
and
that
her
little
french
apron
was
slightly
askew
and
told
her
whatever
else
she
omitted
to
be
sure
to
learn
to
waltz
he
was
then
introduced
to
madame
moreau
who
remarked
to
madame
chicchi
her
italian
teacher
what
a
very
looking
person
he
was
after
which
he
yawned
several
times
then
touched
his
hat
gracefully
praised
the
very
superior
air
of
the
establishment
brushed
an
imperceptible
atom
of
dust
from
his
beaver
kissed
the
tips
of
his
fingers
to
his
demonstrative
sister
and
tiptoed
terpsichoreally
over
the
academic
threshold
in
addition
to
this
ruth
father
wrote
occasionally
when
a
became
due
or
when
his
tradesmen
bills
came
in
on
the
first
of
january
on
which
occasion
an
annual
fit
of
poverty
seized
him
an
almshouse
loomed
up
in
perspective
he
reduced
the
wages
of
his
cook
two
shillings
and
advised
ruth
either
to
get
married
or
teach
school
three
years
had
passed
under
madame
moreau
roof
ruth
schoolmates
wondering
the
while
why
she
took
so
much
pains
to
bother
her
head
with
those
stupid
books
when
she
was
every
day
growing
prettier
and
all
the
world
knew
that
it
was
quite
unnecessary
for
a
pretty
woman
to
be
clever
when
ruth
once
more
crossed
the
paternal
threshold
hyacinth
levelled
his
at
her
and
exclaimed
honor
ruth
positively
had
a
narrow
escape
from
being
handsome
whether
old
ellet
was
satisfied
with
her
physical
and
mental
progress
ruth
had
no
means
of
knowing
and
now
as
we
have
said
before
it
is
the
night
before
ruth
bridal
and
there
she
sits
though
the
old
church
bell
has
long
since
chimed
the
midnight
hour
gazing
at
the
moon
as
she
cuts
a
shining
path
through
the
waters
and
trembling
while
she
questions
the
dim
uncertain
future
tears
ruth
have
phantom
shapes
of
terror
glided
before
those
gentle
prophet
eyes
has
death
dark
wing
even
now
fanned
those
girlish
temples
chapter
ii
it
was
so
odd
in
ruth
to
have
no
one
but
the
family
at
the
wedding
it
was
just
one
of
her
queer
freaks
where
was
the
use
of
her
white
satin
dress
and
orange
wreath
what
the
use
of
her
looking
handsomer
than
she
ever
did
before
when
there
was
nobody
there
to
see
her
nobody
to
see
her
mark
that
manly
form
at
her
side
see
his
dark
eye
glisten
and
his
chiselled
lip
quiver
as
he
bends
an
earnest
gaze
on
her
who
realizes
all
his
boyhood
dreams
mistaken
ones
it
is
not
admiration
which
that
young
beating
heart
craves
it
is
love
a
very
presentable
fellow
said
hyacinth
as
the
carriage
rolled
away
with
his
new
really
love
is
a
great
beautifier
ruth
looked
quite
handsome
lord
bless
me
how
immensely
tiresome
it
must
be
to
sit
opposite
the
same
face
three
times
a
day
three
hundred
and
days
in
a
year
i
should
weary
of

as
she
untied
her
and
seated
herself
in
the
parlor
to
await
the
coming
of
the
bride
and
bridegroom
i
ca
say
though
that
i
see
the
need
of
his
being
married
i
always
mended
his
socks
he
has
sixteen

new

eight
linen
and
eight
cotton

made
them
myself
out
of
the
hamilton
hamilton
is
good
cotton
too
strong
firm
and
wears
well
eight
cotton
and
eight
linen
shirts
can
anybody
tell
what
he
got
married
for
do
know
if
he
tired
of
his
of
course
he
could
always
come
home
as
to
ruth
i
do
know
anything
about
her
of
course
she
is
perfect
in
eyes
i
remember
the
time
when
he
used
to
think
perfect
i
suppose
i
shall
be
laid
on
the
shelf
now
well
what
beauty
he
can
find
in
that
pale
golden
hair
and
those
eyes
i
do
know
i
ca
say
i
fancy
the
family
either
proud
as
lucifer
all
of
nothing
to
be
proud
of
either
the
father
next
to
nothing
when
he
began
life
the
son
a
conceited
jackanapes
who
divides
his
time
between
writing
rhymes
and
inventing
new
ties
for
his
cravat
well
well
we
shall
see
but
i
doubt
if
this
bride
is
anything
but
a
doll
i
been
peeping
into
her
bureau
drawers
what
is
the
use
of
all
those
ruffles
on
her
i
like
to
know
who
going
to
wash
and
iron
them
to
her
well
why
do
people
make
presents
a
dozen
of
dish
towels
some
crash
rollers
a
ball
of
or
the
like
of
that
there
the
carriage
now
for
one
month
to
come
to
say
the
least
i
shall
be
made
perfectly
sick
with
their
billing
and
cooing
i
should
be
surprised
if
harry
did
speak
to
me
oftener
than
once
a
day
had
he
married
a
practical
woman
i
would
have
cared
somebody
who
looked
as
if
god
made
her
for
something
but
that
little
simpleton
umph
poor
ruth
in
happy
ignorance
of
the
state
of
her
new
feelings
moved
about
her
apartments
in
a
sort
of
blissful
dream
how
odd
it
seemed
this
new
freedom
this
being
one
own
mistress
how
odd
to
see
that
and
those
razors
lying
on
toilet
table
then
that
saucy
looking
those
slippers
and
that
those
fancy
too
and
vests
and
coats
in
unrebuked
proximity
to
her
muslins
laces
silks
and
de
laines
ruth

chapter
iv
good
morning
ruth
i
suppose
i
call
you
only
that
i
ca
get
used
to
being
shoved
one
side
quite
so
suddenly
said
the
old
lady
with
a
faint
attempt
at
a
laugh
oh
pray
do
say
hall
to
said
ruth
handing
her
a
chair
call
me
any
name
that
best
pleases
you
i
shall
be
quite
satisfied
i
suppose
you
feel
quite
lonesome
when
harry
is
away
attending
to
business
and
as
if
you
hardly
knew
what
to
do
with
yourself
you
oh
no
said
ruth
with
a
glad
smile
not
at
all
i
was
just
thinking
whether
i
was
not
glad
to
have
him
gone
a
little
while
so
that
i
could
sit
down
and
think
how
much
i
love
him
the
old
lady
moved
uneasily
in
her
chair
i
suppose
you
understand
all
about
housekeeping
ruth
ruth
blushed
no
said
she
i
have
but
just
returned
from
i
asked
harry
to
wait
till
i
had
learned
matters
but
he
was
not
willing
the
old
lady
untied
her
and
patted
the
floor
restlessly
with
her
foot
it
is
a
great
pity
you
were
not
brought
up
properly
said
she
i
learned
all
that
a
girl
should
learn
before
i
married
harry
has
his
fortune
yet
to
make
you
know
young
people
seem
to
think
that
money
comes
in
showers
whenever
it
is
wanted
that
a
mistake
a
penny
at
a
time
that
the
way
we
got
ours
that
the
way
harry
and
you
will
have
to
get
yours
harry
has
been
brought
up
sensibly
he
has
been
taught
economy
he
is
like
me
naturally
of
a
very
generous
turn
he
will
occasionally
offer
you
in
those
cases
it
will
be
best
for
you
to
pass
it
over
to
me
to
keep
of
course
you
can
always
have
it
again
by
telling
me
how
you
wish
to
spend
it
i
would
advise
you
too
to
lay
by
all
your
handsome
clothes
as
to
the
silk
stockings
you
were
married
in
of
course
you
will
never
be
so
extravagant
as
to
wear
them
again
i
never
had
a
pair
of
silk
stockings
in
my
life
they
have
a
very
silly
frivolous
look
do
you
know
how
to
iron
ruth
yes
said
ruth
i
have
sometimes
my
own
muslins
and
laces
glad
to
hear
it
did
you
ever
seat
a
pair
of
pantaloons
no
said
ruth
repressing
a
laugh
and
yet
half
inclined
to
cry
you
forget
that
i
am
just
home
from
can
you
make
bread
when
i
say
i
bread
old
fashioned
yeast
riz
bread
none
of
your
salæratus
poisonous
mixtures
that
must
be
eaten
as
quick
as
baked
lest
it
should
dry
up
bread
do
you
know
how
to
make
it
no
said
ruth
with
a
growing
sense
of
her
utter
people
in
the
city
always
buy
baker
bread
my
father
did
your
father
land
sake
child
you
must
quote
your
father
now
you
married
you
have
any
father
i
never
had
thought
ruth
to
be
sure
what
does
the
bible
say
father
and
mother
cleave
to
your
wife
or
husband
which
amounts
to
the
same
thing
i
take
it
and
speaking
of
that
i
hope
you
wo
be
always
running
home
or
running
anywhere
in
fact
wives
should
be
keepers
at
home
ruth
continued
the
old
lady
after
a
short
pause
do
you
know
i
should
like
your
looks
better
if
you
did
curl
your
hair
i
do
curl
it
said
ruth
it
curls
naturally
that
a
pity
said
the
old
lady
you
should
avoid
everything
that
looks
frivolous
you
must
try
and
pomatum
it
down
and
ruth
if
you
should
feel
the
need
of
exercise
do
gad
in
the
streets
remember
there
is
nothing
like
a
broom
and
a
to
make
the
blood
circulate
you
keep
a
rag
bag
i
suppose
said
the
old
lady
many
the
glass
dish
i
peddled
away
my
for
not
want
not
i
got
that
framed
somewhere
i
hunt
it
up
and
put
it
on
your
wall
it
wo
do
you
any
harm
to
read
it
now
and
then
i
hope
continued
the
old
lady
that
you
do
read
novels
and
such
trash
i
have
a
very
select
little
library
when
you
feel
inclined
to
read
consisting
of
a
treatise
on
complaints
of
women
an
excellent
sermon
on
predestination
by
our
old
minister
diggs
and
seven
reasons
why
john
rogers
the
martyr
must
have
had
children
instead
of
as
is
supposed
any
time
that
you
stand
in
need
of
reading
come
to
me
and
the
old
lady
smoothing
a
wrinkle
in
her
black
silk
apron
took
a
dignified
leave
chapter
poor
ruth
her
sky
so
soon
overcast
as
the
door
closed
on
the
prim
retreating
figure
of
her
she
burst
into
tears
but
she
was
too
sensible
a
girl
to
weep
long
she
wiped
her
eyes
and
began
to
consider
what
was
to
be
done
it
would
never
do
to
complain
to
harry
dear
harry
he
would
have
to
take
sides
oh
no
that
would
never
do
she
could
never
complain
to
him
of
his
mother
but
why
did
he
bring
them
together
knowing
as
he
must
have
known
how
little
likely
they
were
to
assimilate
this
thought
she
smothered
quickly
but
not
before
it
had
given
birth
to
a
sigh
close
upon
the
heels
of
which
love
framed
this
apology
it
was
so
long
since
harry
had
lived
under
the
same
roof
with
his
mother
he
had
probably
forgotten
her
eccentricities
and
then
she
was
so
dotingly
fond
of
him
that
probably
no
points
of
collision
ever
came
up
between
the
two
in
the
course
of
an
hour
what
with
cold
bathing
and
philosophy
ruth
eyes
and
equanimity
were
placed
beyond
the
suspicion
even
of
a
husband
and
when
she
held
up
her
lips
to
him
so
temptingly
on
his
return
he
little
dreamed
of
the
she
had
so
tearfully
achieved
for
his
sake
chapter
vi
harry
father
began
life
on
a
farm
in
vermont
between
handling
ploughs
hoes
and
harrows
he
had
managed
to
pick
up
sufficient
knowledge
to
establish
himself
as
a
country
doctor
well
contented
to
ride
six
miles
on
horseback
of
a
stormy
night
to
extract
a
tooth
for
some
distracted
wretch
for
cents
naturally
loquacious
and
equally
fond
of
administering
jalap
and
gossip
he
soon
became
a
great
favorite
with
the
women
folks
which
every
aspiring
esculapius
who
reads
this
knows
to
be
half
the
battle
they
soon
began
to
trust
him
not
only
in
drawing
teeth
but
in
cases
involving
the
increase
of
the
village
census
several
successes
in
this
line
which
he
took
no
pains
to
conceal
put
him
behind
a
gig
of
his
own
and
enabled
his
practice
to
overtake
his
fame
as
far
as
the
next
village
like
many
other
persons
who
revolve
all
their
life
in
a
peck
measure
the
doctor
views
of
the
world
in
general
and
its
denizens
in
particular
were
somewhat
circumscribed
added
to
this
he
was
as
persevering
as
a
fly
in
the
and
as
immovable
as
the
old
rusty
on
the
village
which
for
twenty
years
had
never
been
blown
about
by
any
whisking
wind
of
doctrine
when
he
opened
his
mouth
no
dog
must
bark
and
any
dissent
from
his
opinion
however
circumspectly
worded
he
considered
a
personal
insult
as
his
wife
entertained
the
same
liberal
views
occasional
conjugal
collisions
on
this
narrow
track
were
the
consequence
the
interest
of
which
was
intensified
by
each
reminding
the
other
of
their
calvinistic
church
obligations
to
keep
the
peace
they
had
however
one
common
ground
of
undisputed
territory
their
who
was
as
infallible
as
the
pope
and
until
he
got
married
never
did
a
foolish
thing
since
he
was
born
on
this
last
point
their
son
harry
did
not
exactly
agree
with
them
as
he
considered
it
decidedly
the
most
delightful
negotiation
he
had
ever
made
and
one
which
he
could
not
even
think
of
without
a
sudden
acceleration
of
pulse
time
wore
on
the
young
couple
occupying
their
own
suite
of
apartments
while
the
old
people
kept
house
the
doctor
who
had
saved
enough
to
lay
his
with
his
medical
books
on
the
shelf
busied
himself
after
he
had
been
to
market
in
the
morning
in
speculating
on
what
ruth
was
about
or
in
peeping
over
the
balustrade
to
see
who
called
when
the
bell
rang
or
in
counting
the
to
see
how
many
sticks
the
cook
had
taken
to
make
the
pot
boil
for
dinner
the
second
girl
a
supernumerary
of
the
bridal
week
had
long
since
been
dismissed
and
the
doctor
and
his
wife
spent
their
evenings
with
the
cook
to
save
the
expense
of
burning
an
extra
lamp
consequently
betty
soon
began
to
consider
herself
one
of
the
family
and
surprised
ruth
one
day
by
modestly
requesting
the
loan
of
her
bridal
veil
to
wear
to
a
little
party
not
to
speak
of
sundry
naps
to
which
she
treated
herself
in
ruth
absence
in
her
damask
rocking
chair
which
was
redolent
for
some
time
after
of
a
strong
odor
of
still
ruth
kept
her
wise
little
mouth
shut
moving
amid
these
discordant
elements
as
if
she
were
deaf
dumb
and
blind
oh
love
that
thy
silken
reins
could
so
curb
the
spirit
and
bridle
the
tongue
that
thy
uplifted
finger
of
warning
could
calm
that
bounding
pulse
still
that
throbbing
heart
and
send
those
rebellious
tears
unnoticed
back
to
their
source
ah
could
we
lay
bare
the
secret
history
of
many
a
wife
heart
what
martyrs
would
be
found
over
whose
uncomplaining
lips
the
grave
sets
its
unbroken
seal
of
silence
but
was
harry
blind
and
deaf
had
the
bridegroom
of
a
few
months
grown
careless
and
unobservant
was
he
to
whom
every
hair
of
that
sunny
head
was
dear
blind
to
the
inward
struggles
marked
only
by
fits
of
feverish
gaiety
did
he
never
see
the
sudden
to
hide
the
blush
or
starting
tear
did
it
escape
his
notice
that
ruth
would
start
like
a
guilty
thing
if
a
sudden
impulse
of
tenderness
betrayed
her
into
laying
her
hand
upon
his
forehead
or
leaning
her
head
upon
his
shoulder
or
throwing
her
arms
about
his
neck
when
the
jealous
mother
was
by
did
not
his
soul
bend
the
silent
knee
of
homage
to
that
youthful
that
could
repress
its
own
warm
emotions
and
stifle
its
own
sorrows
lest
should
know
a
yes
ruth
read
it
in
the
magnetic
glance
of
the
loving
eye
as
it
lingeringly
rested
on
her
and
in
the
low
thrilling
tone
of
the
whispered
god
bless
you
my
wife
and
many
an
hour
when
alone
in
his
counting
room
was
harry
forgetful
of
business
revolving
plans
for
a
separate
home
for
himself
and
ruth
this
was
rendered
every
day
more
necessary
by
the
increased
encroachments
of
the
old
people
who
insisted
that
no
visitors
should
remain
in
the
house
after
the
hour
of
nine
at
which
time
the
fire
should
be
taken
apart
the
chairs
set
up
the
lights
extinguished
and
a
solemn
silence
brood
until
the
next
it
was
also
suggested
to
the
young
couple
that
the
wear
and
tear
of
the
front
entry
carpet
might
be
saved
by
their
entering
the
house
by
the
back
gate
instead
of
the
front
door
meals
were
very
solemn
occasions
the
old
people
frowning
at
such
times
on
all
attempts
at
conversation
save
when
the
doctor
narrated
the
market
prices
he
paid
for
each
article
of
food
upon
the
table
and
so
time
wore
on
the
old
couple
like
two
scathed
trees
dry
harsh
and
uninviting
presenting
only
rough
surfaces
to
the
clinging
ivy
which
fain
would
clothe
with
brightest
verdure
their
leafless
branches

to
thee
ruth
another
outlet
for
thy
womanly
heart
a
mirror
in
which
thy
smiles
and
tears
shall
be
reflected
back
a
fair
page
on
which
thou
mayst
write
what
thou
wilt
a
heart
that
will
throb
back
to
thine
love
for
love
but
ruth
thinks
not
of
all
this
now
as
she
lies
pale
and
motionless
upon
the
pillow
while
harry
grateful
tears
bedew
his
face
she
can
not
even
welcome
the
little
stranger
harry
thought
her
dear
to
him
before
but
now
as
she
lies
there
so
like
counterpart
a
whole
life
of
devotion
would
seem
too
little
to
prove
his
appreciation
of
all
her
sacrifices
the
advent
of
the
little
stranger
was
viewed
through
very
different
spectacles
by
different
members
of
the
family
the
doctor
regarded
it
as
a
little
automaton
for
pleasant
æsculapian
experiments
in
his
idle
hours
the
old
lady
viewed
it
as
another
barrier
between
herself
and
harry
and
another
tie
to
cement
his
already
too
strong
attachment
for
ruth
and
betty
groaned
when
she
thought
of
the
puny
interloper
in
connection
with
washing
and
ironing
days
and
had
already
made
up
her
mind
that
the
first
time
its
nurse
used
her
new
saucepan
to
make
gruel
she
would
strike
for
higher
wages
poor
little
unconscious
daisy
with
thy
velvet
cheek
nestled
up
to
as
velvet
a
bosom
sleep
on
thou
art
too
near
heaven
to
know
a
taint
of
earth

ruth
nurse
jiff
was
fat
elephantine
and
unctuous
nursing
agreed
with
her
she
had
tasted
too
many
bowls
of
on
the
stairs
tipped
up
too
many
bottles
of
porter
in
the
closet
slid
down
too
many
slippery
oysters
before
handing
them
to
her
lady
not
to
do
credit
to
her
pantry
devotions
jiff
wore
an
uncommonly
stiff
gingham
gown
which
sounded
every
time
she
moved
like
the
rustle
of
a
footfall
among
the
withered
leaves
of
autumn
her
shoes
were
new
thick
and
creaky
and
she
had
a
wheezy
way
of
breathing
consequent
upon
the
consumption
of
the
port
and
oysters
which
was
intensely
crucifying
to
a
sick
ear
jiff
always
forgot
to
bring
her
own
comb
and
hair
brush
she
had
a
way
too
of
opening
drawers
and
closets
by
mistake
thereby
throwing
her
helpless
victim
into
a
state
of
profuse
perspiration
then
she
would
go
to
sleep
between
the
andirons
with
the
new
baby
on
the
edge
of
her
knee
in
alarming
proximity
to
the
coals
would
take
a
pinch
of
snuff
over
the
bowl
of
gruel
in
the
corner
and
knock
down
the
shovel
poker
and
tongs
every
time
she
went
near
the
fire
whispering
sh
sh
sh
at
the
top
of
her
lungs
as
she
glanced
in
the
direction
of
the
bed
as
if
its
demented
occupant
were
the
guilty
cause
of
the
accident
jiff
had
not
nursed
years
for
nothing
she
particularly
affected
taking
care
of
young
mothers
with
their
first
babies
knowing
very
well
that
her
chain
shortened
with
every
after
addition
to
maternal
experience
she
considered
herself
therefore
quite
lucky
in
being
called
upon
to
superintend
little
daisy
advent
it
occasionally
cross
ruth
mind
as
she
lay
almost
fainting
with
exhaustion
on
the
pillow
while
the
ravenous
little
daisy
cried
give
give
whether
it
took
jiff
two
hours
to
make
cup
of
tea
and
brown
slice
of
toast
jiff
solacing
herself
meanwhile
over
an
omelette
in
the
kitchen
with
betty
and
pouring
into
her
ready
ears
whole
histories
of
as
was
whose
ladies
she
nursed
and
how
nobody
but
herself
knew
how
late
they
come
home
when
their
wives
were
sick
though
to
be
sure
she
scorn
to
tell
of
it
sometimes
also
ruth
innocently
wondered
if
it
was
necessary
for
the
nurse
to
occupy
the
same
bed
with
her
lady
particularly
when
her
circumference
was
as
and
her
nose
as
musical
as
jiff
and
whether
there
would
be
any
impropriety
in
her
asking
her
to
take
the
babe
and
keep
it
quiet
of
the
night
that
she
might
occasionally
get
a
nap
sometimes
too
she
considered
the
feasibility
of
requesting
jiff
not
to
select
the
time
when
she
ruth
was
sipping
her
chocolate
to
comb
out
her
false
front
and
polish
up
her
artificial
teeth
and
sometimes
she
marvelled
why
when
jiff
paid
such
endless
visits
to
the
kitchen
she
was
always
as
fixed
as
the
north
star
whenever
dear
harry
came
in
to
her
chamber
to
have
a
conjugal
chat
with
her
chapter
ix
how
do
you
do
this
morning
ruth
said
the
old
lady
lowering
herself
gradually
into
a
arm
chair
how
your
sickness
altered
you
you
look
like
a
ghost
i
should
wonder
if
you
lost
all
your
hair
it
is
no
uncommon
thing
in
sickness
or
your
teeth
either
how
the
baby
she
do
favor
our
side
of
the
house
at
all
she
is
quite
a
plain
child
in
fact
has
she
any
symptoms
yet
of
a
sore
mouth
i
hope
not
because
she
will
communicate
it
to
your
breast
and
then
you
have
a
time
of
it
i
knew
a
poor
feeble
thing
once
who
died
of
it
of
course
you
intend
when
jiff
leaves
to
take
care
of
the
baby
yourself
a
nursery
girl
would
be
very
expensive
i
believe
harry
has
already
engaged
one
said
ruth
i
do
think
he
has
said
the
old
lady
sitting
up
very
straight
because
it
was
only
this
morning
that
the
doctor
and
i
figured
up
the
expense
it
would
be
to
you
and
we
unanimously
came
to
the
conclusion
to
tell
harry
that
you
better
take
care
of
the
child
yourself
i
always
took
care
of
my
babies
you
ought
to
have
mentioned
a
nursery
girl
at
all
to
harry
he
proposed
it
himself
replied
ruth
he
said
i
was
too
feeble
to
have
the
care
of
the
child
pooh
pshaw
stuff
no
such
thing
you
are
well
enough
or
will
be
before
long
now
there
a
girl
board
to
begin
with
servant
girls
eat
like
then
there
the
soap
and
oil
waste
oh
the
thing
is
to
be
thought
of
it
is
perfectly
ruinous
if
you
had
made
a
fool
of
harry
he
never
could
have
dreamed
of
it
you
ought
to
have
sense
enough
to
check
him
when
he
would
go
into
such
extravagances
for
you
but
some
people
any
sense
where
would
all
the
sugar
and
starch
and
soap
go
to
i
like
to
know
if
we
were
to
have
a
second
girl
in
the
house
how
long
would
the
or
or
our
new
last
and
who
is
to
keep
the
back
gate
bolted
with
such
a
chit
flying
in
and
out
will
you
please
hand
me
that
camphor
bottle
said
ruth
laying
her
hand
upon
her
throbbing
forehead
how
my
little
said
harry
entering
ruth
room
as
his
mother
swept
out
what
ails
your
eyes
ruth
said
her
husband
removing
the
little
hands
which
hid
them
a
sudden
pain
said
ruth
laughing
gaily
it
has
gone
now
the
camphor
was
too
strong
good
ruth
brave
ruth
was
harry
deceived
something
ails
eyes
now
but
ruth
has
too
much
tact
to
notice
it
oh
love
thou
skilful
teacher
learned
beyond
all
the
wisdom
of
the
schools
chapter
x
you
will
be
happy
here
dear
ruth
said
harry
you
will
be
your
own
mistress
ruth
danced
about
from
room
to
room
with
the
careless
glee
of
a
happy
child
quite
forgetful
that
she
was
a
wife
and
a
mother
quite
unable
to
repress
the
flow
of
spirits
consequent
upon
her
freedom
ruth
new
house
was
about
five
miles
from
the
city
the
approach
to
it
was
through
a
lovely
winding
lane
a
little
off
the
main
road
skirted
on
either
side
by
a
thick
grove
of
linden
and
elms
where
the
wild
leaped
clinging
from
branch
to
branch
festooning
its
ample
clusters
in
prodigal
profusion
of
fruitage
and
forming
a
dense
shade
impervious
to
the
most
garish
heat
while
beneath
the
wild
unfolded
its
perfumed
leaves
in
the
hedges
till
the
bees
and
went
reeling
away
with
their
honeyed
treasures
you
can
scarce
see
the
house
for
the
drooping
elms
half
a
century
old
whose
long
branches
at
every
swept
across
the
velvet
lawn
the
house
is
very
old
but
ruth
says
all
the
better
for
that
little
patches
of
moss
tuft
the
sloping
roof
and
swallows
and
martens
twitter
round
the
old
chimney
it
has
nice
beams
running
across
the
ceiling
which
threaten
to
bump
harry

head
the
doorways
too
are
low
with
honeysuckle
red
and
white
wreathed
around
the
porches
and
back
of
the
house
there
is
a
high
hill
which
ruth
says
must
be
terraced
off
for
a
garden
surmounted
by
a
gray
rock
crowned
by
a
old
where
you
have
as
fine
a
prospect
of
hill
and
valley
rock
and
river
as
ever
a
sunset
flooded
with
rainbow
tints
it
was
blessed
to
see
the
in
ruth
gentle
eyes
to
see
the
rose
chase
the
lily
from
her
cheek
to
see
the
old
spring
come
back
to
her
step
to
follow
her
from
room
to
room
while
she
draped
the
pretty
white
curtains
and
beautified
unconsciously
everything
her
fingers
touched
she
could
give
an
order
without
having
it
countermanded
she
could
kiss
little
daisy
without
being
called
silly
she
could
pull
out
her
comb
and
let
her
curls
flow
about
her
face
without
being
considered
frivolous
and
better
than
all
she
could
fly
into
her
arms
when
he
came
home
and
kiss
him
without
feeling
that
she
had
broken
any
penal
statute
yes
she
was
free
as
the
golden
orioles
whose
hanging
nests
swayed
to
and
fro
amid
the
glossy
green
leaves
beneath
her
window
but
not
as
thoughtless
ruth
had
a
strong
earnest
nature
she
could
not
look
upon
this
wealth
of
sea
sky
leaf
bud
and
blossom
she
could
not
listen
to
the
little
birds
nor
inhale
the
perfumed
breath
of
morning
without
a
filling
eye
and
brimming
heart
to
the
bounteous
giver
should
she
revel
in
all
this
loveliness
should
her
heart
be
filled
to
its
fullest
capacity
for
earthly
happiness
and
no
grateful
incense
go
up
from
its
altar
to
heaven
and
the
babe
its
wondering
eyes
had
already
begun
to
seek
its
mother
its
little
lip
to
quiver
at
a
harsh
or
discordant
sound
an
unpracticed
hand
must
sweep
that
harp
of
a
thousand
strings
trembling
fingers
must
inscribe
indelibly
on
that
blank
page
characters
to
be
read
by
the
light
of
eternity
the
maternal
eye
must
never
sleep
at
its
post
lest
the
enemy
rifle
the
casket
of
its
gems
and
so
by
her
child
cradle
ruth
first
learned
to
pray
the
weight
her
slender
shoulders
could
not
bear
she
rolled
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
and
with
the
baptism
of
holy
tears
mother
and
child
were
consecrated

rambled

through

in

ran
babbling
and
sparkling
through

emerald
meadow
where
the
golden
moss
piled
up
its
velvet
cushion
in
the
cool
woods
where
the
pretty
clematis
threw
the
graceful
arms
of
youth
the
gnarled
trunk
of
decay
where
the
bearded
grain
swaying
to
and

tempted
to
its
death

reaper
where

red
and

clover
dotted
the

and

nodded
its

crown

smiled
in

beauty
the
lofty

nestling
its
foliage
the
cottages
or
where
the
cattle
dozed
under
the
broad
green
branches
or
bent
to
the
glassy
lake
to
drink

where
on

the
voices

up

eye
of
the
child
to
see
the
delicate
flush
come
and
go
on
her
marble
cheek
and
to
feel
the
silent
pressure
of
her
little
hand
when
this
alone
could
tell
the
rapture
she
had

to
express

said
the

folding
them
up
carefully
in

leathern
case
i
hope
you
be
easy
mis

now
that
we
toted
out

and
baggage
to
please
you
when
i
supposed
i
was
settled
for
the
rest
of
my
life
ca
be
expected
to
have
as
much
natural
affection
or
to
be
as
as
said
the
old
lady
of
course
it
was
some
trouble
to
move
out
here
but
for
harry
sake
i
was
willing
to
do
it
what
does
ruth
know
about
i
like
to
know
a
pretty
muss
she
make
of
it
if
not
around
to
oversee
things
it
strikes
me
retorted
the
doctor
that
you
wo
get
any
thanks
for
it
from
side
of
the
house
at
least
ruth
never
anything
when
you
vex
her

there
a
look
in

well
mis

it
said
the

lady
while
her
very
fluttered
with
indignation
and
it
has
provoked
me
a
thousand
times
more
than
if
she

at

up
i
going

a

as
with
stealthy
steps
she
crossed
a
small
piece
of

between

it

we
here
a

poetry
i
declare
the
most
frivolous
of
all
reading
all
pencil
marked
and
here
something
in
ruth
own
poetry
too
worse
and
worse
well
we
see
how
the
of
this
poetess
looks
i
will
go
into
the
house
the
back
way
and
take
them
by
surprise
that
the
way
to
find
people
out
none
of
your
company
faces
for
me
and
the
old
lady
peered
curiously
through
her
spectacles
on
either
side
as
she
passed
along
towards
the
kitchen
door
and
exclaimed
as
her
eye
fell
on
the
shining
row
milkpans
wonder
if
they
their
milk
or
keep
a
cow
if
they
buy
it
it
must
cost
them
something
if
they
keep
a
cow
i
no
question
the
milk
is
half
wasted
the
old
lady
passed
her
skinny
forefinger
across
one
of
the
pans
examining
her
finger
very
minutely
after
the
operation
and
then
applied
the
tip
of
her
nose
to
the
interior
of
it
there
was
no
fault
to
be
found
with
that
milkpan
if
it
was
ruth
so
scrutinizing
two
or
three
dish
towels
which
were
hanging
on
a
line
to
dry
she
stepped
cautiously
up
to
the
kitchen
door
a
tidy
black
woman
met
her
on
the
threshold
her
woolly
locks
bound
with
a
bandanna
and
her
ebony
face
shining
with
irresistible
good
humor
is
ruth
in
said
the
old
lady
who
missis
said
dinah
ruth
missis
hall
lives
answered
dinah
with
a
puzzled
look
exactly
said
the
old
lady
she
is
my
son
wife
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
missis
said
dinah
curtseying
respectfully
i
never
heard
her
name
called
ruth
afore
massa
calls
her
and
the
old
lady
frowned
is
she
at
home
she
repeated
with
stately
dignity
no
said
dinah
missis
is
gone
rambling
off
in
the
woods
with
little
daisy
she
powerful
fond
of
flowers
and
things
she
climbs
fences
like
a
it
makes
this
chil
laf
to
see
the
ol
farmers
stare
at
her
you
must
have
a
great
deal
to
do
here
said
the
old
lady
frowning
ruth
is
much
of
a
hand
at
plenty
to
do
missis
and
willin
hands
to
do
it
dinah
do
care
how
hard
she
works
if
she
do
work
to
the
tune
of
a
lash
and
missis
hall
goes
singing
about
the
house
so
that
it
makes
time
fly
she
do
ever
you
any
does
she
said
the
persevering
old
lady
lor
bless
you
yes
missis
she
comes
right
in
and
makes
a
pie
for
massa
harry
or
cooks
a
steak
jess
as
easy
as
she
pulls
off
a
flower
and
when
dinah
cooking
anything
new
she
asks
more
questions
how
done
than
this
chil
kin
answer
you
have
a
great
deal
of
company
i
suppose
that
must
make
you
extra
trouble
i
should
think
people
riding
out
from
the
city
to
supper
when
you
are
all
through
and
cleared
away
do
it
tire
you
no
missis
hall
takes
it
easy
she
laf
merry
and
says
to
the
company
get
enough
in
the
city
so
i
sha
give
you
any
we
had
tea
long
ago
but
here
some
fresh
milk
and
some
raspberries
and
cake
and
if

ca
eat
you
ought
to
go
hungry
she

harry

said
the
old
lady
she
dis
chil
let
her
when
she
so
careful
too
of
dinah
bones
well
said
the
old
lady
foiled
at
all
points
i
walk
over
the
house
a
bit
i
guess
i
wo
trouble
you
to
wait
on
me
dinah
and
the
old
lady
started
on
her
exploring
tour
chapter
xiv
this
is
the
parlor
hey
soliloquized
old
hall
as
she
seated
herself
on
the
sofa
a
few
dollars
laid
out
here
i
guess
not
so
fast
my
dear
madam
examine
closely
those
long
white
curtains
looped
up
so
prettily
from
the
open
windows
are
plain
cheap
muslin
but
no
artist
could
have
disposed
their
folds
more
gracefully
the
chairs
and
sofas
also
ruth
covered
with
her
own
nimble
fingers
the
room
has
the
fragrance
of
a
to
be
sure
but
if
you
examine
the
flowers
which
are
scattered
so
profusedly
round
you
will
find
they
are
flowers
which
ruth
basket
in
hand
climbs
many
a
stone
fence
every
morning
to
gather
and
not
a
country
boy
in
the
village
knows
their
as
well
as
she
see
how
skilfully
they
are
arranged
with
what
an
eye
to
the
blending
of
colors
how
dainty
is
that
little
vase
with
those
half
opened
buds
see
that
little
gilt
saucer
containing
only
a
few
tiny
green
leaves
yet
mark
their
exquisite
shape
and
finish
and
there
are
some
wood
anemonies
some
white
with
a
faint
blush
of
pink
at
the
petals
and
others
blue
as
little
daisy
eyes
and
see
that
velvet
moss
with
its
blossoms
must
take
a
deal
of
time
to
gather
and
fix
muttered
the
old
lady
yes
my
dear
madam
but
better
pay
the
than
the
bill
better
seek
health
in
hunting
live
flowers
than
ruin
it
by
manufacturing
those
german
worsted
abortions
you
should
see
your
son
harry
as
he
ushers
a
visitor
in
through
the
low
and
stands
back
to
mark
the
surprised
delight
with
which
he
gazes
upon

little
fairy

you
should
see
how
harry
eyes
glisten
as
they
pass
from
one
flower
vase
to
another
saying
who
but
ruth
would
ever
have
spied
out
tiny
little
blossom
and
little
daisy
has
caught
the
flower
mania
too
and
every
day
she
must
have
vase
in
the
collection
now
withdrawing
a
rose
and
replacing
it
with
a
violet
and
then
stepping
a
pace
or
two
back
and
looking
at
it
with
her
little
head
on
one
side
as
knowingly
as
an
artist
looks
at
the
finishing
touches
to
a
favorite
picture

replied
the
doctor
i
was
born
sometime
before
my

put
up
your
plough
and
lay
that
bit
of
stone

the

this
amateur
farming
is
pretty
play
enough

the

with

of

him

on

the

shaking
him
by
the

i
said
that

up
in

oh
i
thought
you
were
talking
of
those
thievish
robins
stealing
the
cherries
said
the
doctor
as
to
ruth
i
given
her
up
long
ago
never
will
settle
down
to
anything
yesterday
as
i
was
taking
a
walk
over
harry
farm
to
see
if
things
were
not
all
going
to
the
dogs
i
saw
her
down
in
the
meadow
yonder
with
her
shoes
and
stockings
off
wading
through
a
little
brook
to
get
at
some
flowers
which
grew
on
the
other
side
half
an
hour
after
she
came
loitering
up
the
road
with
her
bonnet
hanging
on
the
back
of
her
neck
and
her
apron
crammed
full
of
grasses
and
herbs
and
branches
and
all
sorts
of
green
trash
just
then
the
minister
came
along
i
was
glad
of
it
good
enough
for
her
thinks
i
to
myself
she
blush
for
once
well
what
do
you
think
she
did
mis

said
the
old
lady
in
a
sepulchral
whisper
dropping
her
and
drawing
her
within
kissing
distance
of
the
doctor
why
she
burst
out
perched
herself
on
top
of
a
stone
wall
took
a
great
big
leaf
to
fan
herself
and
then
invited
the
minister
to
sit
down
side
of
her
as
easy
as
if
her
hair
was
all
flying
round
her
face
like
a
wild
arab
i
give
up
now
said
the
old
lady
dropping
her
hands
in
an
attitude
of
the
extremest
dejection
there
no
hope
of
her
after
that
and
what
is
worse
it
is
no
use
talking
to
harry
she
got
him
so
bewitched
that
he
imagines
everything
she
does
is
right
how
she
did
it
passes
me
sure
she
has
no
beauty
i
no
patience
to
see
harry
twisting
those
yellow
curls
of
hers
round
his
fingers
and
calling
them
of
gold
threads
of
fiddlesticks
she
look
a
deal
more
proper
like
if
she
wear
her
hair
smooth
behind
her
ears
as
i
do
but
your
hair
is
false
said
the
literal
doctor
doctor
said
the
old
lady
snapping
her
eyes
i
never
can
argue
with
you
but
you
are
sure
to
get
off
the
track
sooner
or
later
there
is
no

your
telling

morning
in
a
sleigh
daisy
had
already
heard
the
bells
tinkling
at
the
as
pat
necklaced
romeo
who
stood
pawing
and
snorting
as
if
it
were
fine
fun
to
plough
five
miles
of
unbroken
road
into
the
city
daisy
had
turned
papa
sleeves
inside
out
and
warmed
them
thoroughly
at
the
fire
she
had
tied
on
his
moccasins
and
had
thrown
his
fur
collar
round
his
neck
and
now
she
stood
holding
his
warm
cap
and
furred
gloves
while
he
and
mamma
were
saying
their
usual
take
care
of
that
cough
daisy
said
harry
do
come
to
the
door
darling
to
breathe
in
this
keen
air
kiss
your
hand
to
papa
from
the
window
and
harry
scratched
the
frost
away
with
his
finger
nails
from
the
that
daisy
might
see
him
start
oh
how
pretty
exclaimed
the
child
as
pat
tossed
the
bright
buffalo
robe
into
the
sleigh
and
tucked
the
corners
snugly
over
his
master
feet
and
romeo
inspirited
by
the
merry
tinkle
of
the
bells
and
the
keen
frosty
air
stood
on
his
hind
legs
and
playfully
held
up
his
fore
feet
oh
how
pretty
harry
turned
his
head
as
he
gathered
the
reins
in
his
hand
his
cap
was
crowded
down
so
snugly
over
his
forehead
and
his
fur
collar
turned
up
so
closely
about
his
chin
that
only
a
glimpse
of
his
dark
eye
and
fine
roman
nose
was
visible
one
wave
of
the
hand
and
the
light
feathery
snow
flew
on
either
side
from
under
romeo
flying
heels
and
papa
was
out
of
sight

why
in
the
world
ruth
are
you
wandering
about
there
like
a
ghost
in
the
moonlight
said
harry
rubbing
open
his
sleepy
eyes
hist
harry
listen
to
daisy
breathing
it
sounds
as
if
it
came
through
a
brazen
tube
she
must
be
little
wife
do
torment
yourself
she
has
only
a
bad
cold
which
of
course
appears
worse
at
night
her
breathing
is
irregular
because
her
head
is
too
low
give
her
this
pillow
there
now
she
comfortable
what
a
frightened
little
puss
you
are
your
hand
trembles
as
if
you
had
the
palsy
now
go
to
sleep
it
must
be
near
two
you
be
sick
yourself
and
harry
wearied
out
with
an
annoying
day
of
business
was
soon
fast
asleep
only
the
eye
of
god
watches
like
a
mother
ruth
could
not
sleep
she
was
soon
again
at
daisy
side
with
her
fingers
upon
her
wrist
and
her
eye
fixed
upon
the
child
face
marking
every
contortion
of
feature
noting
every
change
of
posture
what
is
it
darling
asked
her
mother
as
daisy
grasped
her
throat
with
both
hands
it
hurts
said
the
child
ruth
glanced
at
harry
he
was
so
weary
it
were
a
pity
to
wake
him
needlessly
perhaps
her
fears
were
groundless
and
she
was
and
then
perhaps
daisy
really
needed
medical
aid
ruth
fears
preponderated
dear
harry
said
she
laying
her
hand
softly
on
his
forehead
do
call
up
pat
and
send
for
the
doctor
certainly
if
you
think
best
said
harry
springing
up
but
it
is
a
cold
night
for
the
old
man
to
come
out
and
really
ruth
daisy
has
only
a
stuffed
cold
let
pat
go
said
ruth
pleadingly
i
shall
feel
happier
harry
it
was
a
venturous
undertaking
to
rouse
pat
suddenly
as
his
bump
of
destructiveness
generally
woke
first
and
a
fight
seemed
always
with
him
a
necessary
preliminary
to
a
better
understanding
of
things
hold

said
harry
seizing
his
brawny
belligerent
fists

the
doctor
as
he
poked
his
bald
poll
out
the
cottage
window
into
the
frosty
night
air
who

what

chapter

stamping
the
snow
from
his
feet
the
doctor
slowly
untied
his
woollen
muffler
took
off
his
hat
settled
his
wig
hung
his
overcoat
on
a
nail
in
the
entry
drew
from
his
pocket
a
huge
red
handkerchief
and
announcing
his
arrival
by
a
blast
loud
enough
to
arouse
the
seven
sleepers
followed
harry
up
stairs
to
the
sick
chamber
the
strong
fell
upon
ruth
white
figure
as
she
sat
pale
and
motionless
in
the
corner
with
daisy
on
her
lap
whose
laborious
breathing
could
be
distinctly
heard
in
the
next
room
a
dark
circle
had
settled
round
the
child
mouth
and
eyes
and
its
little
hands
hung
helplessly
at
its
side
dinah
was
kneeling
at
the
hearth
stirring
a
fresh
mustard
paste
with
an
air
which
seemed
to
say
it
is
no
use
but
i
must
keep
on
doing
something
the
doctor
advanced
drew
his
spectacles
from
their
leathern
case
perched
them
astride
the
end
of
his
nose
and
gazed
steadily
at
daisy
without
speaking
said
ruth
imploringly
nothing
to
be
done
said
the
doctor
in
an
unmoved
tone
staring
at
daisy
why
did
you
come
afore
den
said
dinah
springing
to
her
feet
and
confronting
the
doctor
do
you
see
you
murdered
of
and
she
pointed
to
ruth
whose
head
had
dropped
upon
her
breast
i
tell
you
harry
it
no
use
to
call
another
doctor
said
his
father
shaking
off
his
grasp
the
child
is
struck
with
death
let
her
drop
off
quietly
what
the
sense
of
tormenting
her
harry
shuddered
and
drew
his
father
again
to
daisy
side
help
her
said
ruth
do
talk
try
well
i
can
put
on
these
leeches
if
you
insist
said
the
old
man
uncorking
a
bottle
but
i
tell
you
it
is
only
tormenting
the
dying
dinah
cut
open
the
child
night
dress
and
bared
the
fair
round
chest
to
which
the
leeches
clung
eagerly
daisy
meanwhile
remaining
motionless
and
seemingly
quite
insensible
to
the
disagreeable
pricking
sensation
they
caused
the
other
doctor
is
below
whispered
pat
thrusting
his
head
in
at
the
door
bring
him
up
said
the
old
gentleman
an
expression
of
pain
passed
over
the
young
man
features
as
his
eye
fell
upon
the
child
as
yet
he
had
not
become
so
professionally
hardened
as
to
be
able
to
look
unmoved
upon
the
group
before
him
whose
imploring
eyes
asked
vainly
of
him
the
help
no
mortal
hand
could
give
a
few
questions
he
asked
to
avoid
being
questioned
himself
a
few
remedies
he
tried
to
appease
the
mother
heart
whose
mournful
eyes
were
on
him
like
a
spell
water
said
daisy
faintly
as
she
languidly
opened
her
eyes
god
be
thanked
said
ruth
overcome
by
the
sound
of
that
blessed
little
voice
which
she
never
expected
to
hear
again
god
be
thanked
the
young
doctor
returned
no
answering
smile
as
ruth
and
harry
grasped
his
hand
but
he
walked
to
the
little
window
and
looked
out
upon
the
gray
dawn
with
a
heavy
sigh
as
the
first
faint
streak
of
light
ushered
in
the
day
still
the
flashed
and
flickered
now
upon
the
old
doctor
who
had
fallen
asleep
in
his
arm
chair
now
upon
ruth
bowed
head
now
upon
daisy
who
lay
motionless
in
her
mother
lap
the
deadly
paleness
of
her
countenance
rendered
still
more
fearful
by
the
dark
on
her
night
dress
then
upon
harry
who
kneeling
at
daisy
side
and
stifling
his
own
strong
heart
gazed
alternately
at
mother
and
child
then
upon
dinah
who
with
folded
arms
stood
like
some
grim
sentinel
in
the
shadow
of
the
farther
corner
the
little
mantle
clock
meanwhile
ticking
ticking
on
numbering
the
passing
moments
with
startling
distinctness
oh
in
such
an
hour
when
wave
after
wave
of
anguish
dashes
over
us
where
are
the
infidel
boasted
doubts
as
the
tortured
heart
cries
out
instinctively
save
lord
or
we
perish
slowly
the
night
waned
and
the
stars
paled
up
the
gray
east
the
golden
sun
slowly
glided
one
beam
penetrated
the
little
window
hovering
like
a
halo
over
daisy
sunny
head
a
quick
convulsive
start
and
with
one
wild
cry
as
the
little
throat
filled
to
suffocation
the
fair
white
arms
were
tossed
aloft
then
dropped
powerless
upon
the
bed
of
death
chapter
xxiii
there
can
be
no
sorrow
greater
than
this
sorrow
sobbed
ruth
as
the
heavy
sod
fell
on
daisy
little
breast
in
after
years
when
bitterer
cups
had
been
drained
to
the
dregs
ruth
remembered
these
her
murmuring
words
ah
mourning
mother
he
who
seeth
the
end
from
the
beginning
even
in
this
blow
remembered
mercy
your
is
quite
crushed
by
her
affliction
i
hear
said
a
neighbor
to
old
hall
yes
jones
i
think
she
is
said
the
old
lady
complacently
it
has
taken
right
hold
of
her
it
died
of
croup
i
believe
said
jones
well
they
so
said
the
old
lady
it
is
opinion
the
child
death
was
owing
to
the
thriftlessness
of
the
mother
i
mourn
for
it
because
i
believe
the
poor
thing
is
better
off
you
surprise
me
said
jones
i
always
had
the
impression
that
young
hall
was
a
pattern
mother
people
differ
said
the
old
lady
raising
her
eyebrows
compressing
her
lips
and
looking
mysteriously
at
the
ceiling
as
if
she
tell
a
tale
were
she
not
too
charitable
well
the
amount
of
it
is
said
the
garrulous
old
doctor
emerging
from
the
corner
the
amount
of
it
is
that
the
mother
always
thought
she
knew
better
than
anybody
else
how
to
manage
that
child
now
you
know
mis
jones
i
a
physician
and
to
know
something
about
the
laws
that
govern
the
human
body
but
you
be
astonished
to
hear
that
she
frequently
acted
directly
contrary
to
my
advice
and
this
is
the
result
that
tells
the
whole
story
however
as
mis
hall
says
the
child
is
better
off
and
as
to
ruth
why
the
lord
generally
sends
afflictions
where
they
are
and
the
doctor
returned
to
his
corner
it
looks
very
lonely
at
the
glen
since
they
moved
away
remarked
jones
i
suppose
they
do
think
of
coming
back
how
replied
the
doctor
from
his
corner
i
suppose
your
son
and
his
wife
have
no
idea
of
returning
to
the
glen
said
jones
no
no
ruth
is
one
of
the
uneasy
kind
it
coming
and
going
coming
and
going
with
her
she
fancied
everything
in
doors
and
out
reminded
her
of
daisy
and
kept
wandering
round
trying
to
be
rid
of
herself
now
that
proves
she
did
make
a
sanctifying
use
of
her
trouble
it
no
use
trying
to
dodge
what
the
lord
sends
we
just
got
to
stand
and
take
it
if
we
do
he
be
sending
something
else
them
my
sentiments
and
i
consider
scripteral
i
should
be
surprised
if
was
taken
away
from
her
a
poor
miserable
thing
she
be
to
take
care
of
herself
if
he
was
she
could
earn
the
salt
to
her
porridge

my

aches
for

said
the
kind
jones
hall
is
very
delicately
organized
one
of
those
persons
capable
of
compressing
the
happiness
or
misery
of
a
lifetime
into
a
few
moments
stuff
said
the
doctor
stuff
do
believe
it
an
example
to
the
contrary
i
been
through
everything
and
just
look
at
me
and
the
doctor
advanced
a
pace
or
two
to
give
jones
a
better
view
of
his
peony
face
and
aldermanic
proportions
do
believe
it
mis
jones
stuff
fashion
to
be

a
modern
invention
ridiculous
but
said
the
persistent
jones
do
you
think
doctor
that
do
think
anything
it
said
the
doctor
do
want
to
anything
about
it
have
no
patience
with
any
woman
who
let
a
husband
sell
a
farm
at
such
a
sacrifice
as
harry
was
sold
merely
because
there
was
a
remote
chance
she
would
become
insane
if
she
staid
there
now
i
enough
to
do
plenty
to
do
but
still
i
was
willing
to
superintend
that
farm
a
little
as
my
doing
so
was
such
a
help
to
harry
well
well
they
both
go
to
the
dogs
that
the
amount
of
it
a
rolling
stone
gathers
no
moss
harry
was
good
for
something
before
he
married
ruth
had
a
mind
of
his
own
ruth
aint
the
wife
for
him
he
did
not
appear
to
think
so
replied
the
obstinate
jones
everybody
in
the
village
says
a
happy
couple
they
are
my
hissed
the
old
lady
did
you
doctor
of
course
jones
you
do
suppose
harry
would
be
such
a
fool
as
to
tell
people
how
miserable
he
was
but
jones
are
ca
throw
dust
in
a

retorted
the
independent
jones
with
a
mock
courtesy
to
the
old
lady
as
she
walked
out
the
door
muttering
as
she
went
down
the
road
sally
jones
will
tell
her
the
truth
if
nobody
else
will
mis

said
the
doctor
drawing
himself
up
so
straight
as
to
snap
off
his
button
this
is
the
last
time
that
woman
ever
crosses
threshold
i
shall
tell
deacon
smith
that
i
consider
her
a
proper
subject
for
church
discipline
she
what

many
a

the

of

at
the
window
of
a
large
hotel
in
one
of
those
seaport
towns
the
resort
alike
of
the
invalid
and
sat
ruth
the
fresh
lifting
her
hair
from
temples
thinner
and
paler
than
of
yore
but
stamped
with
a
holier
beauty
from
the
window
might
be
seen
the
blue
waters
of
the
bay
leaping
to
the
bright
sunlight
while
many
a
vessel
outward
and
inward
bound
spread
its
sails
like
some
joyous
sea
bird
but
ruth
was
not
thinking
of
the
sapphire
sky
though
it
were
passing
fair
nor
of
the
blue
sea
decked
with
its
snowy
sails
for
in
her
lap
lay
a
little
shoe
with
the
impress
of
a
tiny
foot
upon
which
her
tears
were
falling
fast
little
shoe
and
yet
no
magician
could
conjure
up
such
blissful
visions
no
artist
could
trace
such
vivid
pictures
no
harp
of
sweetest
sounds
could
so
fill
the
ear
with
music
eight
years
since
the
little
daisy
withered
and
yet
to
the
eye
she
still
blossomed
fair
as
paradise
the
soft
golden
hair
still
waved
over
the
temples
the
sweet
earnest
eyes
still
beamed
with
their
loving
light
the
little
fragile
hand
was
still
outstretched
for
maternal
guidance
and
in
the
wood
and
by
the
stream
they
still
lingered
still
the
little
hymn
was
chanted
at
dawn
the
little
prayer
lisped
at
still
that
gentle
breathing
mingled
with
the
happy
mother
dreams
a
little
creature
crept
to
ruth
side
and
lifting
a
long
wavy
golden
ringlet
from
a
box
on
the
table
near
her
laid
it
beside
her
own
brown
curls

musingly
why
do
you

you

mother
ruth
started
and
looked
at
the
child
the
rosy
flush
had
faded
away
from
little
katy
cheek
and
a
tear
stole
slowly
from
beneath
her
long
lashes
taking
her
upon
her
lap
she
severed
one
tress
of
her
brown
hair
and
laid
it
beside
little
daisy
golden
ringlet
a
bright
glad
smile
lit
up
little
katy
face
and
she
was
just
throwing
her
arms
about
her
mother
neck
to
express
her
thanks
when
stopping
suddenly
she
drew
from
her
dimpled
foot
one
little
shoe
and
laid
it
in
her
mother
palm
smiles
and
tears
ruth
complied
with
the

life
is
about
the
same
in
every
latitude
at
beach

there
was
the
usual
number
of
vapid
fashionable
mothers
dressy
brainless
daughters
sons
impudent
roués
bachelors
anxious
to
give
their
bashfulness

by

and
neglected
children
then
there
were
hops
in
the
hall
and
sails
upon
the

there
were
alleys

a

there
were
bathing

and
parties
there
were
billiard

smoking

reading

flirtation
rooms
room
for
everything
but
thought
there
could
be
little
or
nothing
in
such
an
artificial
atmosphere
congenial
with
a
nature
like
ruth
in
all
this
motley
crowd
there
was
but
one
person
who
interested
her
a
leon
upon
whose
queenly
figure
all
eyes
were
bent
as
she
passed
and
who
received
the
homage
paid
her
with
an
indifference
which
whether
real
or
assumed
became
her
passing
well
her
husband
was
a
tall
prim
person
who
dyed
his
hair
and
whiskers
every
saturday
was
extremely
punctilious
in
all
points
of
etiquette
very
particular
in
his
stated
inquiries
as
to
his
wife
and
his
horse
health
very
fastidious
in
regard
to
the
brand
of
his
wine
and
the
quality
of
his
venison
maintaining
under
all
circumstances
the
same
rigidity
of
feature
the
same
immobility
of
the
cold
stony
gray
eye
the
same
studied
stereotyped
conventionalism
of
manner
ruth
although
shunning
society
found
herself
drawn
to
leon
by
an
unaccountable
magnetism
little
katy
too
with
that
unerring
instinct
with
which
childhood
selects
from
the
crowd
an
unselfish
and
loving
nature
had
already
made
rapid
advances
toward
acquaintance
what
road
to
a
mother
heart
so
direct
as
through
the
heart
of
her
children
with
katy
for
a
medium
the
two
ladies
soon
found
themselves
in
frequent
conversation
ruth
had
always
shrunk
from
female
friendship
it
might
be
that
her
experience
had
something
to
do
in
effecting
this
wholesale
disgust
of
the
commodity
be
that
as
it
may
she
had
never
found
any
woman
who
had
not
misunderstood
and
misinterpreted
her
for
the
common
female
employments
and
recreations
she
had
an
unqualified
disgust

with

and

long
forenoons
spent
in
shopping
or
leaving
bits
of
prinking
and
coquetting
all
these
were
her
aversion
equally
with
herself
leon
seemed
to
despise
these
air
bubbles
ruth
was
sure
that
under
that
faultless
marble
exterior
a
glowing
living
loving
heart
lay
slumbering
waiting
only
the
enchanter
touch
to
wake
it
into
life
the
more
she
looked
into
those
dark
eyes
the
deeper
seemed
their
depths
ruth
longed
she
scarce
knew
why
to
make
her
life
happy
oh
if
she
a
soul
ruth
thought
of
leon
and
shuddered
leon
was
often
subject
to
severe
and
prostrating
attacks
of
nervous
headache
on
these
occasions
ruth
magnetic
touch
seemed
to
woo
coy
slumber
like
a
spell
and
the
fair
sufferer
would
lie
peacefully
for
hours
while
ruth
fingers
strayed
over
her
temples
or
her
musical
voice
like
david
harp
exorcised
the
demon
pain
you
are
better
now
said
ruth
as
leon
slowly
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
about
her
you
have
had
such
a
nice
sleep
i
think
you
will
be
able
to
join
us
at
the
tea
table
i
will
brush
these
long
dishevelled
locks
and
robe
these
dainty
limbs
though
to
my
eye
you
look
lovelier
just
as
you
are
you
are
very
beautiful
mary
i
heard
a
couple
of
young
ladies
discussing
you
in
the
the
other
evening
envying
your
beauty
and
your
jewels
and
the
magnificence
of
your
wardrobe
did
they
envy
me
my
asked
mary
in
a
slow
measured
tone
that
would
have
been
useless
said
ruth
averting
her
eyes
but
they
said
he
denied
you
nothing
in
the
way
of
dress
equipage
or
ornament
yes
said
mary
i
have
all
those
pretty
toys
to
satisfy
my
they
equally
with
myself
are
necessary
appendages
to

establishment
oh
ruth
and
the
tears
streamed
through
her
jewelled
fingers
love
me
pity
me
you
who
are
so
blessed
i
too
love
that
is
the
drop
of
poison
in
my
cup
when
daughters
stand
at
the
altar
ruth
never
compel
them
to
say
words
to
which
the
heart
yields
no
response
the
chain
is
none
the
less
galling
because
its
links
are
golden
god
bless
you
ruth
is
long
since
i
have
shed
such
tears
you
have
touched
the
rock

that
the

gushed

october
had
come
coy
and
chill
in
the
morning
warm
and
winning
at
noon
veiling
her
coat
of
many
colors
in
a
fleecy
mist
at
evening
yet
lovely
still
in
all
her
changeful
moods
the
gay
butterflies
of
fashion
had
already
spread
their
shrivelled
wings
for
the
warmer
atmosphere
of
the
city
harry
and
ruth
still
lingered
there
was
beauty
for
them
in
the
rainbow
dyes
in
the
crimson
barberry
clusters
drooping
from
the
wayside
hedges
in
the
wild
that
threw
off
its
leaves
to
tempt
the
rustic
hand
with
its
purple
clusters
in
the
piles
of
apples
that
lay
gathered
in
heaps
beneath
the
orchard
trees
in
the
yellow
ears
of
indian
corn
that
lay
scattered
on
the
seedy
floor
of
the
breezy
barn
in
the
festoons
of
dried
apples
and
mammoth
squashes
and
pumpkins
that
lay
ripening
round
the
thrifty
farmers
doors
and
in
the
circling
leaves
that
came
eddying
down
in
brilliant
showers
on
the
indian
summer
soft
but
treacherous
breath
you
are
ill
harry
said
ruth
laying
her
hand
upon
his
forehead
slightly
so
replied
harry
languidly
a
pain
in
my
head
and
a
strong
ague
chill
prevented
harry
from
finishing
the
sentence
ruth
who
had
never
witnessed
an
attack
of
this
kind
grew
pale
as
his
teeth
chattered
and
his
powerful
frame
shook
violently
from
head
to
foot
have
you
suffered
much
in
this
way
asked
the
physician
who
was
summoned
i
had
the
fever
and
ague
very
badly
some
years
since
at
the
west
said
harry
it
is
an
unpleasant
visitor
doctor
you
must
rid
me
of
it
as
soon
as
you
can
for
the
sake
of
my
little
wife
who
though
she
can
endure
pain
herself
like
a
martyr
is
an
arrant
little
coward
whenever
it
attacks
me
do
look
so
sober
ruth
i
shall
be
better
i
can
not
afford
time
to
be
sick
long
for
i
have
a
world
of
business
on
hand
i
had
an
important
appointment
this
very
day
which
it
is
a
thousand
pities
to
postpone
but
never
mind
i
shall
certainly
be
better
but
harry
was
not
better
nor
the
next
day
nor
the
next
the
doctor
pronouncing
his
case
to
be
one
of
decided
typhus
fever
very
reluctantly
the
active
man
postponed
his
plans
and
business
speculations
and
allowed
himself
to
be
placed
on
the
sick
list
with
a
sigh
of
impatience
he
saw
his
hat
and
coat
and
boots
put
out
of
sight
and
watched
the
different
phials
as
they
came
in
from
the
apothecary
and
counted
the
stroke
of
the
clock
as
it
told
the
tedious
hours
and
marvelled
at
the
patience
with
which
he
now
recollected
ruth
bore
a
long
martyrdom
without
a
groan
or
complaint
but
soon
other
thoughts
and
images
mixed
confusedly
in
his
brain
like
the
shifting
colors
of
a
kaleidoscope
he
was
floating
drifting
sinking
soaring
by
turns
the
hot
blood
coursed
through
his
veins
like
molten
lava
his
eye
glared
deliriously
and
the
hand
never
raised
but
in
blessing
fell
with
fevered
strength
upon
the
unresisting
form
of
the
loving
wife
you
must
have
a
nurse
said
the
doctor
to
ruth
it
is
dangerous
for
you
to
watch
with
your
husband
alone
he
might
injure
you
seriously
in
one
of
these
paroxysms
but
harry
has
an
unconquerable
dislike
to
a
hired
nurse
said
ruth
his
reason
may
return
at
any
moment
and
the
sight
of
one
will
trouble
him
i
am
not
afraid
replied
ruth
between
a
tear
and
a
smile
but
you
will
wear
yourself
out
you
must
remember
that
you
owe
a
duty
to
your
children
my
has
the
claim
said
ruth
resuming
her
place
by
the
and
during
the
long
hours
of
day
and
night
regardless
of
the
lapse
of
time
regardless
of
hunger
thirst
or
weariness
she
glided
noiselessly
about
the
room
arranged
the
pillows
mixed
the
healing
draught
or
watched
with
a
silent
prayer
at
the
sufferer
while
harry
lay
tossing
from
side
to
side
his
white
teeth
glittering
through
his
unshorn
beard
raving
constantly
of
her
prolonged
absence
and
imploring
her
in
tones
to
come
to
his
side
and
bring
daisy
from
the
glen
many
a
friendly
voice
whispered
at
the
door
how
is
he
the
irish
waiters
crossed
themselves
and
stept
softly
through
the
hall
as
they
went
on
their
hasty
errands
and
many
a
consultation
was
held
among
gentlemen
friends
who
had
made
harry
acquaintance
at
the
hotel
during
the
pleasant
summer
to
decide
which
should
first
prove
their
friendship
by
watching
with
him
ruth
declined
all
these
offers
to
fill
her
place
i
will
never
leave
him
she
said
his
reason
may
return
and
his
eye
seek
vainly
for
me
no
no
i
thank
you
all
watch
me
if
you
will
but
do
not
ask
me
to
leave
him
in
the
still
midnight
when
the
lids
of
the
kind
but
weary
watchers
drooped
heavily
with
slumber
rang
mournfully
in
ruth
ear
the
of
gethsemane
lord
could
ye
not
watch
with
me
one
hour
and
pressing
her
lips
to
the
hot
and
fevered
hand
before
her
she
murmured
i
will
never
leave
thee
nor
forsake
thee
chapter

you
got
the
doctor
and
the
little
brown
bundle

put

there
in
the
chayna
closet
drinking
your
brandy
and
water
and
asked
you
to
put
them
in
your
because
my
bag
was
full
of
scissors
camphor
and
i
would
have
left
for
any
money
such
a
sight
of
trouble
as
it
was
to
get
them
focussed
right
to
my
eyes
how
you
doctor
be
so
blundering
i
declare
it
is
enough
to
provoke
a
saint
if
that
the
case
there
no
immediate
call
for
to
get
vexed
said
the
doctor
tartly
is
that
the
house
asked
the
old
lady
her
curiosity
getting
the
better
of
her
indignation
what
a
big
hotel
i
wonder
if
harry
worse
mercy
me
i
all
of
a
quiver
i
wonder
if
they
will
take
us
right
into
the
i
wonder
if
there
many
ladies
in
it
my
bonnet
is
awfully
jammed
beside
i
so
powdered
with
dust
that
i
look
as
if
i
had
had
an
ash
barrel
sifted
over
me
doctor
doctor
do
go
on
so
far
ahead
it
looks
as
if
i
had
no
protector
how
harry
said
the
doctor
to
a
waiter
who
stood
gossipping
on
the
piazza
steps
with
a
comrade
funny
old
chap
said
the
waiter
without
noticing
the
doctor
query
i
say
bill
look
how
his
hair
is
cut
hair
said
tom
it
is
a
wig
bless
my
eyes
so
it
is
and
a
red
one
too
bad
symptoms
red
wigs
are
the
cheapest
no
extra
fees
to
be
got
out
of
customer
for
blacking
boots
and
bringing
hot
beafsteaks
besides
just
look
at
his
baggage
you
can
always
judge
of
a
traveler
bill
by
his
trunks
it
never
fails
now
like
to
see
a
trunk
thickly
studded
with
brass
nails
and
covered
with
a
linen
overall
then
i
know
if
it
is
a
lady
that
there
diamond
rings
inside
and
plenty
of
cash
if
is
a
gentleman
that
he
knows
how
to
order
in
the
forenoon
and
a
bottle
of
old
wine
or
two
with
his
dinner
and
how
to
fee
the
poor
fellow
who
brings
it
too
who
lives
on
a
small
salary
with
large
expectations
how
harry
thundered
the
doctor
again
after
waiting
what
he
considered
a
reasonable
time
for
an
answer
or
if
are
too
lazy
to
tell
you
whiskered
jackanapes
go
call
your
employer
the
word
employer
recalled
the
rambling
waiter
to
his
senses
and
great
was
his
consternation
on
finding
that
the
old
chap
with
the
red
wig
was
the
father
of
young
hall
who
was
beloved
by
everything
in
the
establishment
down
to
old
neptune
the
i
told
you
so
said
the
doctor
turning
to
his
wife
harry
no
better
consultation
this
morning
very
little
hope
of
him
so
much
for
not
being
here
to
prescribe
for
him
ruth
shouldered
a
great
responsibility
when
she
brought
him
away
out
of
reach
of
practice
you
go
into
that
room
there
mis
hall
no
with
your
traps
and
things
and
take
off
your
bonnet
and
keep
quiet
while
i
go
up
and
see
him
chapter
xxviii
humph
said
the
doctor
humph
as
ruth
drew
aside
the
curtain
and
the
light
fell
full
upon
harry
face
humph
it
is
all
up
with
he
in
the
last
stage
of
the
complaint
wo
live
two
days
and
stepping
to
the
table
the
doctor
uncorked
the
different
phials
applied
them
to
the
end
of
his
nose
examined
the
labels
and
then
returned
to
the
where
ruth
stood
bending
over
harry
so
pallid
so
tearless
that
one
involuntarily
prayed
that
death
when
he
aimed
his
dart
might
strike
down
both
together
humph
said
the
doctor
again
when
did
he
have
his
reason
last
a
few
moments
day
before
yesterday
said
ruth
without
removing
her
eyes
from
harry
well
he
has
been
yes
murdered
just
as
much
as
if
you
had
seen
the
knife
put
to
his
throat
that
tells
the
whole
story
and
i
do
care
who
knows
it
i
have
been
looking
at
those
phials
wrong
course
of
treatment
altogether
for
typhoid
fever
fatal
mistake
his
death
will
lie
heavy
at
door
and
he
glanced
at
ruth
hush
he
is
coming
to
himself
said
ruth
whose
eyes
had
never
once
moved
from
her
husband
then
i
must
tell
him
that
his
hours
are
numbered
said
the
doctor
thrusting
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
pompously
walking
round
the
bed
no
no
whispered
ruth
grasping
his
arm
with
both
hands
you
will
kill
him
the
doctor
said
it
might
destroy
the
last
chance
for
his
life
tell
him
you
know
he
is
not
afraid
but
oh
spare
him
the
parting
with
me
it
will
be
so
hard
he
loves
me
father
pshaw
said
the
doctor
shaking
her
off
he
ought
to
settle
up
his
affairs
while
he
can
i
do
know
how
he
wants
things
fixed
harry
harry
said
he
touching
his
shoulder
i
come
to
see
you
do
you
know
me
father
said
harry
languidly
yes
i
i
sick
i
shall
be
better
soon
do
worry
about
me
where
my
wife
where
ruth
you
be
better
harry
said
the
doctor
bluntly
stepping
between
him
and
ruth
you
may
not
live
the
day
out
if
you
have
got
anything
to
say
you
better
say
it
now
before
your
mind
wanders
you
are
a
dead
man
harry
and
you
know
that
when
i
say
i
know
what
i
talking
about
the
sick
man
gazed
at
the
speaker
as
if
he
were
in
a
dream
then
slowly
and
with
a
great
effort
raising
his
head
he
looked
about
the
room
for
ruth
she
was
kneeling
at
the
bedside
with
her
face
buried
in
her
hands
harry
reached
out
his
emaciated
hand
and
placed
it
upon
her
bowed
head
ruth
wife
her
arm
was
about
his
neck
in
an
instant
her
lips
to
his
but
her
eyes
were
tearless
and
her
whole
frame
shook
convulsively
oh
how
i
leave
you
who
will
care
for
you
oh
god
in
mercy
spare
me
to
her
and
harry
fell
back
on
his
pillow
the
shock
was
too
sudden
reason
again
wandered
he
heard
the
shrill
whistle
of
the
cars
recalling
him
to
the
city
whirl
of
business
he
had
stocks
to
negotiate
he
had
notes
to
pay
he
had
dividends
due
then
the
scene
changed
he
could
not
be
carried
on
a
hearse
through
the
street
surrounded
by
a
gaping
crowd
ruth
must
go
alone
with
him
by
night
why
he
die
at
all
he
would
take
anything
where
was
the
doctor
why
did
they
waste
time
in
talking
why
not
do
something
more
for
him
how
cruel
of
ruth
to
let
him
lie
there
and
die
we
will
try
this
new
remedy
said
one
of
the
consulting
physicians
to
harry
father
it
is
the
only
thing
that
remains
to
be
done
and
i
confess
i
have
no
faith
in
its
efficacy
in
this
case
he
rallies
again
said
ruth
clasping
her
hands
the
children
said
harry
bring
me
the
children
presently
said
the
new
physician
try
and
swallow
this
first
and
he
raised
his
head
tenderly
they
were
brought
him
little
nettie
came
first
her
dimpled
arms
and
rosy
face
in
strange
contrast
to
the
pallid
lips
she
bent
in
childish
glee
to
kiss
then
little
katy
shrinking
with
a
strange
awe
from
the
dear
papa
she
loved
so
much
and
sobbing
she
scarce
knew
why
at
his
whispered
words
be
kind
to
your
mother
katy
again
harry
eyes
sought
ruth
she
was
there
but
a
film
a
mist
had
come
between
them
he
could
not
see
her
though
he
felt
her
warm
breath
and
now
that
powerful
frame
collected
all
its
remaining
energies
for
the
last
dread
contest
with
death
so
fearful
so
terrible
was
the
struggle
that
friends
stood
by
with
suppressed
breath
and
averted
eyes
while
ruth
alone
with
a
fearful
calmness
hour
after
hour
wiped
the
death
damp
from
his
brow
and
the
oozing
foam
from
his
pallid
lips
he
is
gone
said
the
old
doctor
laying
harry
hand
down
upon
the
coverlid
no
he
breathes
again
ah
that
his
last
take
her
away
said
the
doctor
as
ruth
fell
heavily
across
her
husband
body
and
the
unresisting
form
of
the
insensible
wife
was
borne
into
the
next
room
strange
hands
closed
harry
eyes
parted
his
damp
locks
straightened
his
manly
limbs
and
folded
the
marble
hands
over
as
noble
a
heart
as
ever
lay
cold
and
still
beneath
a
shroud
chapter
xxix
it
is
really
quite
dreadful
to
see
her
in
this
way
said
hyacinth
as
they
chafed
ruth
hands
and
bathed
her
temples
it
is
really
quite
dreadful
somebody
ought
to
tell
her
when
she
comes
to
that
her
hair
is
parted
unevenly
and
needs
brushing
sadly
harry
features
look
quite
beautiful
in
repose
it
is
a
pity
the
barber
should
have
been
allowed
to
shave
off
his
beard
after
death
it
looked
quite
oriental
and
picturesque
but
the
sight
of
ruth
in
this
way
is
really
dreadful
it
quite
unnerves
me
i
shall
look
ten
years
older
by
i
must
go
down
and
take
a
turn
or
two
on
the
piazza
and
hyacinth
paced
up
and
down
thinking
not
of
the
bereaved
sister
who
lay
mercifully
insensible
to
her
loss
nor
yet
of
the
young
girl
whose
heart
was
to
throb
trustfully
at
the
altar
by
his
side
on
the
morrow
but
of
her
broad
lands
and
full
coffers
with
which
he
intended
to
keep
at
bay
the
haunting
creditors
who
were
impertinent
enough
to
spoil
his
daily
digestion
by
asking
for
their
just
dues
one
the
effect
of
the
sleeping
potion
administered
to
ruth
had
passed
away
slowly
she
unclosed
her
eyes
and
gazed
about
her
the
weary
nurse
forgetful
of
her
charge
had
sunk
into
heavy
slumber
where
was
harry
ruth
presses
her
hands
to
her
temples
oh
god
the
consciousness
that
come
the
frantic
of
the
arms
to
clasp
a
vain
shadow
where
had
they
lain
him
she
crossed
the
hall
to
harry
sick
room
the
key
was
in
the
lock
she
turned
it
with
trembling
fingers
oh
god
the
dreadful
stillness
of
that
outlined
form
the
calm
majesty
of
that
marble
brow
on
which
the
moonbeams
fell
as
sweetly
as
if
that
peaceful
sleep
was
but
to
restore
him
to
her
widowed
arms
that
half
filled
glass
from
which
his
dying
lips
had
turned
away
those
useless
phials
that
watch
watch
moving
and
so
still
the
utter
helplessness
of
human
aid
the
dreadful
might
of
omnipotence
harry
oh
when
was
he
ever
deaf
before
to
the
music
of
that
voice
oh
how
could
ruth
god
forgive
her
look
upon
those
dumb
lips
and
say
thy
will
be
done
horrible
muttered
hyacinth
as
the
undertaker
passed
him
on
the
stairs
with
harry
coffin
these
business
details
are
very
shocking
to
a
sensitive
person
i
beg
your
pardon
did
you
address
me
said
he
to
a
gentleman
who
raised
his
hat
as
he
passed
i
wished
to
do
so
though
an
entire
stranger
to
you
said
the
gentleman
with
a
sympathizing
glance
which
was
quite
thrown
away
on
hyacinth
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
living
under
the
same
roof
this
summer
with
your
afflicted
sister
and
her
noble
husband
and
have
become
warmly
attached
to
both
in
common
with
several
warm
friends
of
your
i
am
pained
to
learn
that
owing
to
the
failure
of
parties
for
whom
he
had
become
responsible
there
will
be
little
or
nothing
for
the
widow
and
her
children
when
his
affairs
are
settled
it
is
our
wish
to
make
up
a
purse
and
request
her
acceptance
of
it
through
you
as
a
slight
token
of
the
estimation
in
which
we
held
her
husband
many
virtues
i
understand
you
are
to
leave
before
the
funeral
which
must
be
my
apology
for
intruding
upon
you
at
so
unseasonable
an
hour
with
the
courtliest
of
bows
in
the
blandest
of
tones
hyacinth
assured
while
he
thanked
kendall
that
himself
his
father
and
indeed
all
the
members
of
the
family
were
abundantly
able
and
most
solicitous
to
supply
every
want
and
anticipate
every
wish
of
ruth
and
her
children
and
that
it
was
quite
impossible
she
should
ever
suffer
for
anything
or
be
obliged
in
any
way
at
any
future
time
to
exert
herself
for
her
own
or
their
support
all
of
which
good
news
for
ruth
highly
gratified
kendall
who
grasped
the
velvet
palm
of
hyacinth
and
dashed
away
a
grateful
tear
that
the
promise
to
the
widow
and
fatherless
was
remembered
in
heaven
chapter
xxx
they
are
very
attentive
to
us
here
remarked
the
doctor
as
one
after
another
of
harry
personal
friends
paid
their
respects
for
his
sake
to
the
old
couple
at
no
very
attentive
and
yet
mis
hall
i
only
practiced
physic
in
this
town
six
months
five
years
ago
it
is
really
astonishing
how
long
a
good
physician
will
be
remembered
and
the
doctor
crossed
his
legs
comfortably
and
tapped
on
his
ruth
brother
hyacinth
leaves
before
the
funeral
doctor
said
the
old
lady
i
suppose
you
see
through
he
intends
to
be
off
and
out
of
the
way
before
the
time
comes
to
decide
where
ruth
shall
put
her
head
after
harry
is
buried
and
there
her
father
just
like
him
he
has
been
as
uneasy
as
an
eel
in
a
ever
since
he
came
and
this
morning
went
off
without
asking
a
question
about
affairs
i
suppose
he
thinks
it
is
business
and
he
owning
bank
stock
i
tell
you
doctor
that
ruth
may
go
for
all
the
help
she
get
from
folks
or
from
me
either
said
the
doctor
thrusting
his
thumbs
into
the
of
his
vest
and
striding
across
the
room
she
has
been
a
spoiled
baby
long
enough
she
will
find
earning
her
living
a
different
thing
from
sitting
with
her
hands
folded
with
harry
chained
to
her
feet
what
did
you
do
with
that
bottle
of
old
wine
mis
hall
which
i
told
you
to
bring
out
of
harry
room
he
never
drank
but
one
glass
of
it
after
that
gentleman
sent
it
to
him
and
we
might
as
well
have
it
as
to
let
those
lazy
waiters
drink
it
up
there
were
two
or
three
bunches
of
grapes
too
he
did
eat
you
had
better
take
them
too
while
you
are
about
it
well
it
do
seem
after
all
as
if
harry
was
dead
said
the
doctor
musingly
but
the
lord
will
be
done
here
comes
your
mis
hall
good
afternoon
good
afternoon
sir
said
miss
skinlin
with
a
doleful
whine
drawing
down
the
corners
of
her
mouth
and
eyes
to
suit
the
occasion
sad
affliction
you
met
with
as
our
minister
says
is
like
the
herb
of
the
field
blooming
withered
life
is
short
will
you
have
your
dress
gathered
or
biased
quite
immaterial
said
the
old
lady
anxious
to
appear
indifferent
though
you
may
as
well
i
suppose
do
it
the
way
which
is
worn
the
most
well
some
likes
it
one
way
and
then
again
some
likes
it
another
the
doctor
wife
in
the
big
white
house
yonder
do
you
know
the
wife
no
said
the
old
lady
nice
folks
never
mind
my
giving
back
the
change
when
they
pay
me
was
a
skefflit
do
you
know
the
skefflits
possible
why
they
are
our
first
folks
well
la
where
was
i
oh
the
doctor
wife
has
gowns
biased
but
then
she
getting
fat
and
wants
to
look
slender
i
advise
you
to
have
yourn
gathered
dreadful
affliction
you
met
with
beautiful
corpse
your
son
is
i
always
look
at
corpses
to
remind
me
of
my
latter
end
some
corpses
keep
much
longer
than
others
do
you
think
so
they
tell
me
your
son
wife
is
most
crazy
because
they
doted
on
one
another
so
the
doctor
and
his
wife
exchanged
meaning
looks
tell
said
miss
skinlin
dropping
her
shears
well
i
never
desaitful
the
heart
is
as
our
minister
says
why
everybody
about
here
took
for
regular
is
not
gold
that
glitters
remarked
the
old
lady
there
is
many
a
that
nobody
knows
anything
about
but
he
who
made
the
heart
in
my
opinion
our
son
was
not
anxious
to
continue
in
this
world
of
trial
longer
you
do
said
miss
skinlin
pious
said
the
doctor
was
he
not
son
though
since
his
marriage
his

influence
was
very
worldly
pity
whined
miss
skinlin
professors
should
let
their
light
shine
always
try
to
drop
a
word
in
season
wherever
business
calls
will
you
have
a
fold
on
your
sleeve
i
do
think
it
would
be
out
of
place
even
on
this
mournful
occasion
tufts
wore
one
when
her
eldest
child
died
and
she
was
dreadful
i
remember
she
gave
me
poor
dear
a
note
instead
of
a
two
but
that
was
a
thing
i
had
the
heart
to
harass
her
about
at
such
a
time
i
respected
her
grief
too
much
did
i
understand
you
that
i
was
to
put
the
folds
on
your
sleeve
you
may
do
as
you
like
whined
the
old
lady
people
dress
more
at
hotels
yes
said
miss
skinlin
and
i
often
feel
reproved
for
aiding
and
abetting
such
foolish
vanities
and
yet
if
i
refused
from
conscientious
scruples
to
trim
dresses
i
suppose
somebody
else
so
you
see
it
would
do
any
good
your
is
left
rich
i
suppose
i
always
think
that
a
great
consolation
to
a
bereaved
widow
you
need
any
such
thing
said
the
doctor
facing
miss
skinlin
she
has
the
first
red
cent
dreadful
shrieked
miss
skinlin
what
she
going
to
do
that
tells
the
whole
story
said
the
doctor
sure
enough
what
she
going
to
do
i
suppose
she
live
with
said
miss
skinlin
suggestively
you
need
suppose
either
retorted
the
doctor
it
every
person
miss
skinlin
who
is
agreeable
enough
to
be
taken
into
one
house
besides
she
has
got
folks
of
her
own
oh
ah
said
miss
skinlin
rich
yes
very
said
the
doctor
unless
some
of
their
poor
relatives
turn
up
in
which
case
they
are
always
dreadfully
out
of
pocket
i
said
miss
skinlin
with
a
significant
nod
well
i
do
see
anything
left
for
her
to
do
but
to
earn
her
living
like
some
other
folks
said
the
doctor
oh
ah
said
miss
skinlin
who
had
at
last
possessed
herself
of
the
whole
story
i
forgot
to
ask
you
how
wide
a
hem
i
should
allow
on
your
black
crape
veil
said
miss
skinlin
tying
on
her
bonnet
to
go
half
a
yard
width
is
not
considered
too
much
for
the
affliction
your
daughter
the
widow
will
probably
have
that
width
said
the
crafty
in
my
opinion
ruth
is
in
no
deeper
affliction
than
we
are
said
the
doctor
growing
very
red
in
the
face
although
she
makes
more
fuss
about
it
so
you
may
just
make
the
hem
of
mis
hall
veil
deep
too
and
send
the
bill
into
no
where
it
will
be
footed
by
doctor
zekiel
hall
who
is
not
in
the
habit
of
ordering
what
he
pay
for
tells
the
whole
story
good
morning
said
miss
skinlin
with
another
doleful
whine
may
the
lord
be
your
support
and
let
the
light
of
his
countenance
shine
upon
you
as

slowly
the
funeral
procession
wound
along
the
of
the
cemetery
stepped
aside
and
gazed
into
the
first
carriage
as
it
passed
in
he
saw
only
a
pale
woman
veiled
in
sable
and
two
little
wondering
rosy
faces
gazing
curiously
out
the
carriage
window
all
about
on
either
side
were
graves
some
freshly
sodded
others
green
with
many
a
summer
verdure
and
all
treasuring
sacred
ashes
while
the
mourners
went
about
the
streets
dust
to
dust
harry
coffin
was
lifted
from
the
hearse
and
laid
upon
the
green
sward
by
the
side
of
little
daisy
over
him
waved
leafy
trees
of
his
own
planting
while
through
the
branches
the
shifting
shadows
came
and
went
lending
a
mocking
glow
to
the
dead
man
face
little
katy
came
forward
and
gazed
into
the
yawning
grave
till
her
golden
curls
fell
like
a
veil
over
her
wondering
eyes
ruth
leaned
upon
the
arm
of
her
cousin
a
dry
flinty
ossified
man
of
business
a
man
of
angles
a
man
of
forms
a
man
with
veins
of
ice
who
looked
the
almighty
in
the
face
complacently
thanking
god
he
was
not
as
other
men
are
who
gazed
with
stony
eyes
upon
the
open
grave
and
the
orphan
babes
and
the
bowed
form
at
his
side
which
swayed
to
and
fro
like
the
young
tree
before
the
tempest
blast
dust
to
dust
ruth
shrinks
trembling
back
then
leans
eagerly
forward
now
she
takes
the
last
lingering
look
at
features
graven
on
her
memory
with
lines
of
fire
and
now
as
the
earth
falls
with
a
hard
hollow
sound
upon
the
coffin
a
lightning
thought
comes
with
stunning
force
to
little
katy
and
she
sobs
out
oh
they
are
covering
my
papa
up
i
ca
ever
see
papa
any
more
dust
to
dust
the
sexton
smooths
the
moist
earth
carefully
with
his
reversed
spade
ruth
eyes
follow
his
movements
with
a
strange
fascination
now
the
carriages
roll
away
one
after
another
and
the
wooden
man
turns
to
ruth
and
says
come
she
looks
into
his
stony
face
then
at
the
mound
utters
a
low
stifled
cry
and
staggers
forth
with
her
crushing
sorrow
oh
earth
earth
with
thy
mocking
skies
of
blue
thy
placid
silver
streams
thy
myriad
odorous
flowers
thy
wheels
of
triumph
rolling
rolling
on
over
breaking
hearts
and
prostrate

maimed
tortured
crushed
yet
not
destroyed
oh
mocking

snatching
from
our
frenzied
grasp
the
coveted

and
is
it
because
biddy
do
suit
yer
that
ye
be
afther
sending
her
away
said
ruth
nursery
maid
no
biddy
replied
ruth
you
have
been
respectful
to
me
and
kind
and
faithful
to
the
children
but
i
can
not
afford
to
keep
you
now
since
and
ruth
voice
faltered
if
that
is
all
my
leddy
said
biddy
brightening
up
then
i
not
be
afther
laving
sure
thank
you
said
ruth
quite
moved
by
her
devotion
but
you
must
not
work
for
me
without
wages
besides
biddy
i
could
not
even
pay
your
board
and
the
tears
not
dry
on
your
cheek
and
the
father
of
him
and
you
with
plenty
of
the
siller
may
the
divil
fly
away
wid
why
nettie
is
but
a
babby
yet
and
masther
used
to
say
you
must
walk
every
day
to
keep
off
the
bad
headaches
and
it
coming
could
weather
and
you
take
nettie
out
and
you
ca
lave
her
with
katy
and
anyhow
it
biddy
that
be
going
away
intirely
the
allusion
to
harry
tender
care
of
ruth
health
opened
the
wound
afresh
and
she
wept
convulsively
i
say
it
a
shame
said
biddy
becoming
more
excited
at
the
sight
of
her
tears
and
you
ca
do
it
my
leddy
you
are
as
white
as
a
sheet
of
paper
i
said
ruth
controlling
herself
with
a
violent
effort
say
no
more
biddy
i
do
know
where
i
am
going
but
wherever
it
may
be
i
shall
always
be
glad
to
see
you
katy
and
nettie
shall
not
forget
their
kind
nurse
now
go
and
pack
your
trunk
said
ruth
assuming
a
composure
she
was
far
from
feeling
i
thank
you
for
your
kind
offer
though
i
can
not
accept
it
may
the
sowls
of
niver
get
out
of
purgatory
that
biddy
last
word
to
said
the
impetuous
irish
girl
and
if
the
priest
himself
should
say
that
peter
would
open
the
gate
for
your
leddyship
i
would
believe
him
and
unclasping
little
nettie
clinging
arms
from
her
neck
and
giving
a
hurried
kiss
to
little
katy
biddy
went
sobbing
through
the
door
with
her
check
apron
over
her
broad
irish
face

xxxiii
who
that
coming
up
the
doctor
said
the
old
lady
ruth
father
as
true
as
the
world
ah
i
understand
we
shall
see
what
we
shall
see
mind
you
keep
a
stiff
upper
lip
doctor
good
morning
doctor
said
ellet
good
morning
sir
said
the
doctor
stiffly
fine
place
you
have
here
doctor
very
replied
the
doctor
i
have
just
come
from
a
visit
to
ruth
said
ellet
the
imperturbable
doctor
slightly
nodded
to
his
visitor
as
he
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
she
seems
to
take
her
husband
death
very
hard
does
she
replied
the
doctor
i
sorry
to
hear
remarked
ellet
fidgeting
in
his
chair
that
there
is
nothing
left
for
the
support
of
the
family
so
am
i
said
the
doctor
i
suppose
the
world
will
talk
about
us
if
nothing
is
done
for
her
said
the
ellet
very
likely
replied
the
doctor
harry
was
child
said
ellet
suggestively
ruth
is
yours
said
the
doctor
yes
i
know
said
ellet
but
you
are
better
off
than
i
am
doctor
i
deny
it
i
deny
it
retorted
the
doctor
fairly
roused
you
own
the
house
you
live
in
and
have
a
handsome
income
or
to
have
said
he
sneeringly
at
the
rate
you
live
if
you
have
brought
up
your
daughter
in
extravagance
so
much
the
worse
for
you
and
ruth
must
settle
that
between
you
i
wash
hands
of
her
i
have
no
objection
to
take
harry
and
try
to
bring
them
up
in
a
sensible
manner
but
in
that
case
i
have
none
of
the
mother
interference
then
her
hands
will
be
free
to
earn
her
own
living
and
she
none
too
good
for
it
either
i
do
believe
in
your
women
proud
you
are
all
proud
all
your
family
that
tells
the
whole
story
this
was
rather
plain
saxon
as
the
increased
redness
of
ears
testified
but
pecuniary
considerations
helped
him
to
swallow
the
bitter
pill
without
making
a
wry
face
i
do
suppose
ruth
could
be
induced
to
part
with
her
children
said
ellet
meditatively
let
her
try
to
support
them
then
till
she
gets
starved
out
replied
the
doctor
i
suppose
you
know
if
the
mother
inability
to
maintain
them
is
proved
the
law
obliges
each
of
the
to
take
one
this
was
a
new
view
of
the
case
and
one
which
immediately
put
to
flight
any
reluctance
ellet
might
have
had
to
force
ruth
to
part
with
her
children
and
remarking
that
he
thought
upon
reflection
that
the
children
be
better
off
with
the
doctor
ellet
took
his
leave
i
thought
that
stroke
would
tell
said
the
doctor
laughing
as
ellet
closed
the
door
yes
you
hit
the
right
nail
on
the
head
that
time
remarked
the
old
lady
but
those
children
will
be
a
sight
of
trouble
they
never
sat
still
five
minutes
at
a
time
since
they
were
born
but
i
soon
cure
them
of
that
i
determined
ruth
sha
have
them
if
they
fret
me
to
but
what
an
avaricious
old
man
ellet
is
we
ought
to
be
thankful
we
have
more
of
the
gospel
spirit
but
the
clock
has
struck
nine
doctor
it
is
time
to
have
prayers
and
go
to
bed
chapter
xxxiv
the
day
was
dark
and
gloomy
incessant
weeping
and
fasting
had
brought
on
one
of
ruth
most
violent
attacks
of
nervous
headache
ah
where
was
the
hand
which
had
so
lately
charmed
that
pain
away
where
was
the
form
that
with
uplifted
finger
and
tiptoe
tread
hushed
the
slightest
sound
excluded
the
torturing
light
changed
the
heated
pillow
and
bathed
the
aching
temples
poor
ruth
nature
had
been
tasked
its
utmost
with
sad
memories
and
weary
vigils
and
she
sank
fainting
to
the
floor
well
might
the
frightened
children
huddle
breathless
in
the
farther
corner
the
coffin
the
shroud
and
the
grave
were
all
too
fresh
in
their
childish
memory
well
might
the
tearful
prayer
go
up
to
the
only
friend
they
knew
please
god
do
take
away
our
mamma
too
ruth
heard
it
not
well
had
she
woke
but
the
bitter
cup
was
not
yet
drained
good
morning
ruth
said
her
father
a
few
hours
after
frowning
slightly
as
ruth
pale
face
and
the
swollen
eyes
of
her
children
met
his
view
sick
one
of
my
bad
headaches
replied
ruth
with
a
quivering
lip
well
that
comes
of
excitement
you
should
get
excited
i
never
allow
myself
to
worry
about
what
ca
be
helped
this
is
the
hand
of
god
and
you
ought
to
see
it
i
came
to
bring
you
good
news
the
doctor
has
very
generously
offered
to
take
both
your
children
and
support
them
it
will
be
a
great
burden
off
your
hands
all
he
asks
in
return
is
that
he
shall
have
the
entire
control
of
them
and
that
you
keep
away
it
is
a
great
thing
ruth
and
what
i
did
expect
of
the
doctor
knowing
his
avaricious
habits
now
you
have
something
pleasant
to
think
about
getting
their
things
ready
to
go
the
sooner
you
do
it
the
better
how
soon
think
i
can
part
with
my
children
replied
ruth
in
a
voice
which
though
low
was
perfectly
clear
and
distinct
perfect
madness
said
her
father
rising
and
pacing
the
floor
they
will
have
a
good
home
enough
to
eat
drink
and
wear
and
be
taught
to
disrespect
their
mother
said
ruth
in
the
same
clear
low
tone
pshaw
said
her
father
impatiently
do
you
mean
to
let
such
a
trifle
as
that
stand
in
the
way
of
their
bread
and
butter
i
poor
ruth
or
at
least
i
be
who
knows
so
you
must
not
depend
on
me
i
want
you
to
consider
that
before
you
refuse
perhaps
you
expect
to
support
them
yourself
you
ca
do
it
that
clear
and
if
you
should
refuse
the
doctor
offer
and
then
die
and
leave
them
he
would
take
them
their
in
will
said
ruth
he
says
thy
fatherless
children
with
me
perversion
of
scripture
perversion
of
scripture
said
ellet
foiled
with
his
own
weapons
ruth
replied
only
with
her
tears
and
a
kiss
on
each
little
head
which
had
nestled
up
to
her
with
an
indistinct
idea
that
she
needed
sympathy
it
is
of
no
use
getting
up
a
scene
it
wo
move
me
ruth
said
ellet
irritated
by
the
sight
of
the
weeping
group
before
him
and
the
faint
twinges
of
his
own
conscience
the
doctor
take
the
children
there
nothing
else
left
father
said
ruth
rising
from
her
couch
and
standing
before
him
my
children
are
all
i
have
left
to
love
in
pity
do
not
distress
me
by
urging
what
i
can
never
grant
as
you
make
your
bed
so
lie
in
it
said
ellet
buttoning
up
his
coat
and
turning
his
back
upon
his
daughter
it
was
a
sight
to
move
the
stoutest
heart
to
see
ruth
that
night
kneeling
by
the
side
of
those
sleeping
children
with
upturned
eyes
and
clasped
hands
of
entreaty
and
lips
from
which
no
sound
issued
though
her
heart
was
quivering
with
agony
and
yet
a
pitying
eye
looked
down
upon
those
orphaned
sleepers
a
pitying
ear
bent
low
to
list
to
the
widow
voiceless

xxxv
well
mis
hall
you
have
got
your
answer
ruth
wo
part
with
the
children
said
the
doctor
as
he
refolded
ellet
letter
i
believe
you
have
lived
with
me
forty
years
come
last
january
have
you
doctor
said
his
amiable
spouse
what
of
that
i
do
see
where
that
remark
is
going
to
fetch
up
mis
hall
said
the
doctor
you
are
not
as
young
as
you
might
be
to
be
sure
but
i
no
boy
myself
there
you
go
again
off
the
track
i
did
make
any
allusion
to
my
age
it
a
thing
i
do
it
a
thing
i
never
wish
to
do
i
repeat
that
i
have
lived
with
you
these
forty
years
well
did
you
ever
know
me
back
out
of
anything
i
undertook
did
you
ever
see
me
foiled
that
letter
makes
no
difference
with
me
harry
children
i
determined
to
have
sooner
or
later
what
ca
be
had
by
force
must
be
had
by
stratagem
i
propose
therefore
a
compromise
you
and
ellet
had
better
agree
to
furnish
a
certain
sum
for
awhile
for
the
support
of
ruth
and
her
children
giving
her
to
understand
that
it
is
discretionary
and
may
stop
at
any
minute
that
will
conciliate
ruth
and
will
better
too
the
fact
is
miss
taffety
told
me
yesterday
that
she
heard
some
hard
talking
about
us
down
in
the
village
between
rice
and
deacon
gray
whose
child
ruth
watched
so
many
nights
with
when
it
had
the
scarlet
fever
yes
it
will
have
a
better
look
doctor
and
we
can
withdraw
the
allowance
whenever
the
days
wonder
is
over
these
people
have
something
else
to
do
than
to
keep
track
of
poor
widows
i
never
supposed
a
useless
fine
lady
like
ruth
would
rather
work
to
support
her
children
than
to
give
them
up
but
i
do
give
her
any
credit
for
it
now
for
i
quite
sure
it
all
sheer
obstinacy
and
only
to
spite
us
continued
the
old
lady
doctor
and
the
old
lady
cocked
her
head
on
one
side
and
crossed
her
two
forefingers
whenever
you
see
a
gentle
woman
look
out
for
a
hurricane
i
tell
you
that
placid
ruth
is
a
smouldering
volcano
that
tells
the
whole
story
said
the
doctor
and
speaking
of
volcanoes
it
wo
be
so
easy
to
make
ellet
subscribe
anything
for
ruth
support
he
thinks
more
of
one
cent
than
of
any
child
he
ever
had
i
am
expecting
him
every
moment
mis
hall
to
talk
over
our
proposal
about
ruth
perhaps
you
had
better
leave
us
alone
you
know
you
have
a
kind
of
irritating
way
if
anything
comes
across
you
and
you
might
upset
the
whole
business
as
to
my
paying
anything
towards
board
unless
he
does
his
full
share
you
need
fear
of
course
not
well
i
leave
you
said
the
old
lady
with
a
sly
glance
at
the
china
closet
though
i
doubt
if
understand
managing
him
alone
now
i
could
wind
him
round
my
little
finger
in
five
minutes
if
i
chose
but
i
hate
to
stoop
to
it
i
so
detest
the
whole
family
i
shake
hands
with
you
there
said
the
doctor
but
that
puppy
of
a
hyacinth
is
my
aversion
though
ruth
is
bad
enough
in
her
way
a
mincing
conceited
popinjay
faugh
do
you
suppose
mis
hall
there
be
anything
in
a
man
who
wears
fancy
a
seal
ring
on
his
little
finger
and
changes
his
coat
and
vest
a
dozen
times
a
day
no
he
a
sensuous
fop
that
tells
the
whole
story
ought
to
be
picked
up
with
a
pair
of
and
laid
carefully
on
a
ineffable
puppy
they
made
a
great
fuss
about
his
writings
said
the
old
lady
made
a
fuss
fudge
there
that
piece
of
his
about
saviour
he
describes
him
as
he
would
a
broadway
dandy
that
fellow
is
all
surface
i
tell
you
there
no
depth
in
him
how
should
there
be
is
he
an
ellet
but
look
here
comes
his
father
good
day
doctor
my
time
is
rather
limited
this
morning
said
father
nervously
was
it
of
ruth
you
wished
to
speak
to
me
yes
said
the
doctor
she
seems
to
feel
so
badly
about
letting
the
children
go
that
it
quite
touched
my
feelings
and
i
thought
of
allowing
her
something
for
awhile
towards
their
support
very
generous
of
you
said
ellet
infinitely
relieved
very
yes
continued
the
doctor
i
heard
yesterday
that
deacon
gray
and
rice
two
very
influential
church
members
were
talking
hard
of
you
and
me
about
this
matter
yes
as
you
remarked
ellet
i
generous
and
i
am
to
give
ruth
a
small
sum
for
an
unspecified
time
provided
you
will
give
her
the
same
amount
said
ellet
i
am
a
poor
man
doctor
be
surprised
any
day
if
i
had
to
mortgage
the
house
i
live
in
you
would
have
me
die
in
the
almshouse
would
you
no
and
i
suppose
you
would
be
willing
that
ruth
should
said
the
doctor
who
could
take
her
part
when
it
suited
him
to
carry
a
point
money
is
tight
money
is
tight
said
old
ellet
frowning
when
a
man
marries
his
children
they
ought
to
be
considered
off
his
hands
i
do
know
why
i
should
be
called
upon
ruth
went
out
of
my
family
and
went
into
yours
and
there
she
was
when
her
trouble
came
money
is
tight
though
of
course
do
feel
it
doctor
living
here
on
your
income
with
your
hands
folded
yes
yes
retorted
the
doctor
getting
vexed
in
his
turn
that
all
sounds
very
well
but
the
question
is
what
my
beside
when
a
man
has
earned
his
money
by
riding
six
miles
of
a
cold
night
to
pull
a
tooth
for
cents
he
do
feel
like
throwing
it
away
on
other
folks
children
are
not
those
children
as
much
your
as
they
are
mine
said
ellet
sharply
as
he
peered
over
his
spectacles
well
i
do
know
about
that
said
the
doctor
taking
an
æsculapian
view
of
the
case
should
think
they
were
blue
eyes
sanguine
temperament
like
their
mother
not
much
hall
blood
in
i
fancy
more
the
pity
it
is
no
use
being
uncivil
said
ellet
reddening
never
am
uncivil
i
came
here
because
i
thought
you
had
something
to
say
if
you
have
not
i
go
my
time
is
precious
you
have
not
answered
my
question
yet
said
the
doctor
i
asked
you
if
you
would
give
the
same
that
i
would
to
ruth
for
a
time
only
a
time
the
fact
is
ellet
continued
the
doctor
forced
to
fall
back
at
last
upon
his
reserved
argument
we
are
both
church
members
and
the
churches
to
which
we
belong
have
a
way
which
i
think
is
a
wrong
way
but
that
neither
here
nor
there
of
meddling
in
these
little
family
matters
it
would
not
be
very
pleasant
for
you
or
me
to
be
catechised
or
disciplined
by
a
church
committee
and
it
my
advice
to
you
to
avoid
such
a
disagreeable
alternative
they
say
hard
things
about
us
we
have
a
christian
reputation
to
sustain
brother
ellet
and
the
doctor
grew
pietistic
and
pathetic
ellet
looked
anxious
if
there
was
anything
he
particularly
prided
himself
upon
it
was
his
reputation
for
devoted
piety
here
was
a
desperate
struggle
mammon
pulling
one
way
the
church
the
other
the
doctor
saw
his
advantage
and
followed
it
come
ellet
what
will
you
give
here
a
piece
of
paper
put
it
down
in
black
and
white
said
the
vigilant
doctor
never
put
anything
on
paper
never
put
anything
on
paper
said
ellet
in
a
solemn
tone
with
a
ludicrously
frightened
air
parchments
lawyers
witnesses
and
things
make
me
nervous
ha
ha
chuckled
the
old
lady
from
her
in
the
well
then
if
you
wo
put
it
on
paper
me
what
you
will
give
said
the
persistent
doctor
i
about
it
said
the
frenzied
ellet
seizing
his
hat
as
if
instant
escape
were
his
only
safety
the
doctor
followed
him
into
the
hall
did
you
make
him
do
it
asked
the
old
lady
in
a
hoarse
whisper
as
the
doctor
entered
yes
but
it
was
like
drawing
teeth
replied
the
doctor
it
is
astonishing
how
avaricious
he
is
he
may
not
stick
to
his
promise
now
for
he
would
not
put
it
on
paper
and
there
was
no
witness
was
there
though
said
the
old
lady
chuckling
trust
me
for
that
chapter
xxxvi
in
a
dark
narrow
street
in
one
of
those
heterogeneous
abounding
in
the
city
where
clerks
apprentices
and
bolt
their
meals
with
railroad
velocity
where
the
with
red
arms
frowzy
head
and
leathern
lungs
screams
in
the
entry
for
any
boarder
who
happens
to
be
inquired
for
at
the
door
where
one
plate
suffices
for
fish
flesh
fowl
and
dessert
where
soiled
sticky
crockery
oily
cookery
and
bad
grammar
predominate
where
greasy
cards
are
shuffled
and
bad
cigars
smoked
of
an
evening
you
might
have
found
ruth
and
her
children
jim
what
do
you
think
of
her
said
a
fellow
with
a
flashy
and
vest
over
which
several
yards
of
gilt
were
festooned
ostentatiously
prettyish
is
she
deuced
nice
form
said
jim
lighting
a
cheap
cigar
and
hitching
his
heels
to
the
mantel
as
he
took
the
first
whiff
i
should
mind
kissing
her
said
sam
glancing
in
an
opposite
mirror
i
flatter
myself
you
would
stand
a
poor
chance
when
your
humble
servant
was
round
if
i
had
not
made
myself
scarce
out
of
friendship
you
would
not
have
made
such
headway
with
sue
the
little
milliner
pooh
said
jim
susan
gill
was
delf
this
little
widow
is
porcelain
i
say
it
is
a
deuced
pity
she
should
stay
up
stairs
crying
her
eyes
out
the
way
she
does
want
to
marry
her
hey
said
sam
with
a
sneer
not
i
none
of
your
families
for
me
pretty
foot
she
i
always
put
on
my
coat
in
the
front
entry
about
the
time
she
goes
up
stairs
to
get
a
peep
at
it
it
is
a
confounded
pretty
foot
sam
bless
me
if
it
is
i
should
like
to
drive
the
owner
of
it
out
to
the
some
pleasant
afternoon
i
must
say
sam
i
like
widows
i
do
know
any
occupation
more
interesting
than
helping
to
dry
up
their
tears
and
then
the
little
dears
are
so
grateful
for
any
little
attention
wonder
if
my
coat
wo
be
done
that
rascally
tailor
ought
to
be
snipped
with
his
own
shears
well
now
i
wonder
when
you
gentlemen
intend
taking
yourselves
off
and
quitting
the
said
the
landlady
perching
a
cap
over
her
disheveled
tresses
this
parlor
is
the
only
place
i
have
to
dress
in
ca
you
do
your
talking
and
smoking
in
your
own
rooms
come
now
here
a
lot
of
newspapers
just
take
them
and
be
off
and
give
a
woman
a
chance
to
make
herself
beautiful
beautiful
exclaimed
sam
the
old
dragon
she
would
make
a
good
scarecrow
for
a
or
a
for
a
piratical
cruiser
beautiful
and
the
speaker
smoothed
a
wrinkle
out
of
his
flashy
yellow
vest
it
is
my
opinion
that
the
uglier
a
woman
is
the
more
beautiful
she
thinks
herself
also
that
any
of
the
sex
may
be
bought
with
a
yard
of
ribbon
or
a
breastpin
certainly
said
jim
you
need
have
lived
to
this
time
of
life
to
have
made
that
discovery
and
speaking
of
that
reminds
me
that
the
little
widow
is
as
poor
as
job
turkey
my
washerwoman
confound
her
for
ironing
off
my
says
that
she
wears
her
clothes
because
she
ca
afford
to
pay
for
both
washing
and
ironing
she
does
replied
sam
she
get
tired
of
that
after
awhile
i
shall
request
dragon
to
let
me
sit
next
her
at
the
table
i
begin
by
helping
the
children
offering
to
cut
up
their
victuals
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
that
will
please
the
mother
you
know
hey
but
by

and
i

the
of
tom
develin
was
no
exception
to
the
above
rule
though
we
will
do
him
the
justice
to
give
in
our
affidavit
that
the
for
seven
consecutive
years
had
stood
precisely
in
the

spot
bounded
on
the
north
by
a
box
of

originally
in

sheets
of
blank
paper
rescued
economically
from

to
save
too
prodigal
consumption
of

it
is
unnecessary
to
add
that
tom
develin
was
a
bachelor
perpendicular
as
a
moving

fearful
his
joints
would
unhinge

supporting
his

by

on

professors
of
colleges
students
scholars
and
the
literati

by
dint
of
patient
listening
to
their
desultory
conversations
he
had
picked
up
threads
of
information
on
literary
subjects
which
he
carefully
wound
around
his
memory
to
be
woven
into
his
own
where
such
information
would
tell
always
of
course
omitting
quotation

some

he
left

his

urged

what
can
ruth
do
with
it
as
the

says
she
has
no

and
with
her
it
is
not
probable
she
would
sell

the

she

struck
a
chord
which
vibrated
oh
how
painfully
why
we
go
home
mother
continued
katy
wo
papa
ever
ever
come
and
take
us
away
there
is
something
in
my
throat
which
makes
me
want
to
cry
all
the
time
mother
and
katy
leaned
her
curly
head
wearily
on
her
mother
shoulder
ruth
took
the
child
on
her
lap
and
averting
her
eyes
said
with
a
forced
smile
little
sister
do
cry
katy
because
she
is
a
little
baby
and
do
know
anything
replied
katy
she
used
to
stay
with
biddy
but
papa
used
to
take
me
to
walk
and
toss
me
up
to
the
wall
when
he
came
home
and
make
rabbits
with
his
fingers
on
the
wall
after
tea
and
take
me
on
his
knee
and
tell
me
about
little
red
riding
hood
and
oh
i
want
papa
i
want
papa
said
the
child
with
a
fresh
burst
of
tears
ruth
tears
fell
like
rain
on
katy
little
face
oh
how
could
she
who
so
much
needed
comfort
speak
words
of
cheer
how
could
her
eyes
and
palsied
hand
the
gloom
of
so
dark
a
night
see
and
arrest
a
sunbeam
katy
dear
kiss
me
you

it
grieved
you
to
see
him
sick

gone
to

where
there
is
no
more

no
more

papa
is
happy
now
katy
happy
without

and
said
katy
with
a
grieved
lip
oh
questioning

who
is
sufficient
for
thee
how
can

which
so
stammeringly

good
morning
hall
said
develin
handing
ruth
the
letter
and
seating
himself
at
what
he
considered
a
safe
distance
from
a
female
i
received
that
letter
from
the
doctor
this
morning
and
i
think
it
would
be
well
for
you
to
attend
to
his
request
as
soon
as
possible
ruth
perused
the
letter
and
handed
it
back
with
a
trembling
hand
saying
is
true
the
clothes
are
of
no
use
but
it
is
a
great
comfort
to
me
develin
to
keep
everything
that
once
belonged
to
harry
then
pausing
a
moment
she
asked
have
they
a
right
to
demand
those
things
mr
develin
i
am
not
very
well
versed
in
law
replied
develin
dodging
the
unexpected
question
but
you
know
the
doctor
does
bear
thwarting
and
your
children
in
fact
here
develin
twisted
his
thumbs
and
seemed
rather
at
a
loss
well
the
fact
is
hall
in
the
present
state
of
your
affairs
you
can
not
afford
to
refuse
true
said
ruth
mournfully
true
harry
clothes
were
collected
from
the
drawers
one
by
one
and
laid
upon
the
sofa
now
a
little
pencilled
memorandum
fluttered
from
the
pocket
now
a
handkerchief
dropped
upon
the
floor
slightly
odorous
of
cologne
or
cigars
there
were
shaped
by
his
full
round
throat
with
the
creases
still
in
the
silken
folds
and
there
was
a
crimson
smoking
cap
ruth
gift
the
gilt
tassel
slightly
tarnished
where
it
had
touched
the
moist
dark
locks
then
his
which
ruth
herself
had
often
playfully
thrown
on
while
combing
her
hair
each
had
its
little
history
each
its
tender
home
associations
daguerreotyping
on
tortured
memory
sunny
pictures
of
the
past
oh
i
can
not
i
can
not
said
ruth
as
her
eye
fell
upon
oh
develin
i
can
not
develin
coughed
hemmed
walked
to
the
window
drew
off
his
gloves
and
drew
them
on
and
finally
said
anxious
to
terminate
the
interview
i
can
fold
them
up
quicker
than
you
mrs
hall
if
you
please
replied
ruth
sinking
into
a
chair
you
will
leave
me
develin
pointing
to
the
white
satin
vest
said
develin
with
an
attempt
to
be
facetious
the
old
doctor
ca
use
that
i
suppose
the
trunk
was
packed
the
key
turned
in
the
lock
and
the
porter
in
waiting
preceded
by
develin
shouldered
his
burden
and
followed
him
down
stairs
and
out
into
the
street
and
there
sat
ruth
with
the
tears
dropping
one
after
another
upon
the
wedding
vest
over
which
her
fingers
strayed
caressingly
oh
where
was
the
heart
which
had
throbbed
so
tumultuously
beneath
it
on
that
happy
bridal
eve
with
what
a
echo
fell
upon
her
tortured
ear
those
bridal
words

death

herbert
are
you
aware
that
this
is
the
sixth
spoonful
of
sugar
you
have
put
in
that
cup
of
tea
and
what
a
forlorn
face
i
as
lief
look
at
a
tombstone
now
look
at
did
you
ever
see
such
a
fit
as
that
boot
is
not
my
hair
as
smooth
and
as
glossy
as
if
i
expected
to
dine
with
some
other
gentleman
than
my
husband
is
not
this
jacket
a
miracle
of
shapeliness
look
what
a
foil
you
are
to
all
this
loveliness
eyes
mouth
drawn
down
at
the
corners
you
are
a
dose
to
contemplate
mary
said
her
husband
without
noticing
her
raillery
do
you
remember
mrs
hall
hall
replied
mary
oh
ruth
ellet
yes
i
used
to
go
to
school
with
her
she
has
lost
her
husband
they
say
yes
and
a
fine
noble
fellow
he
was
too
and
very
proud
of
his
wife
i
remember
he
used
to
come
into
the
store
and
say
with
one
of
his
pleasant
smiles
i
wonder
if
you
have
anything
here
handsome
enough
for
my
wife
to
wear
he
bought
all
her
clothes
himself
even
to
her
gloves
and
boots
and
was
as
tender
and
careful
of
her
as
if
she
were
an
infant
well
she
came
into
my
store
dressed
in
deep
mourning
leading
her
two
little
girls
by
the
hand
and
asked
to
see
me
and
what
do
you
think
she
wanted
i
am
sure
i
do
know
said
mary
carelessly
a
yard
of
black
crape
i
suppose
she
wanted
to
know
said
herbert
if
i
could
employ
her
to
make
up
and
trim
those
lace
collars
caps
and
under
sleeves
we
sell
at
the
store
i
tell
you
mary
i
could
scarce
keep
the
tears
out
of
my
eyes
she
looked
so
sad
and
then
those
poor
little
children
mary
i
thought
of
you
and
how
terrible
it
would
be
if
you
and
our
little
sue
and
charley
were
left
so
destitute
destitute
replied
mary
why
her
father
is
a
man
of
property
her
brother
is
in
prosperous
circumstances
and
her
cousin
lives
in
one
of
the
most
fashionable
squares
in
the
city
yes
wife
i
know
it
and
that
makes
it
all
the
harder
for
hall
to
get
employment
because
people
knowing
this
take
it
for
granted
that
her
relatives
help
her
or
to
and
prefer
to
give
employment
to
others
whom
they
imagine
need
it
more
this
is
natural
and
perhaps
i
should
have
thought
so
too
had
it
been
anybody
but
harry
hall
wife
but
all
i
could
think
of
was
what
harry
poor
fellow
have
said
had
he
ever
thought
his
little
pet
of
a
wife
would
have
come
begging
to
me
for
employment
what
did
you
tell
her
said
mary
why
you
know
the
kind
of
work
she
wished
is
done
by
forty
hands
in
a
room
directly
over
the
store
under
the
superintendence
of
betsy
norris
of
course
they
would
prefer
doing
the
work
at
home
to
coming
down
there
to
do
it
but
that
is
against
our
rules
i
told
her
this
and
also
that
if
i
made
an
exception
in
her
favor
the
forewoman
would
know
it
because
she
had
to
prepare
the
work
and
that
would
cause
dissatisfaction
among
my
hands
what
do
you
think
she
said
she
offered
to
come
and
sit
down
among
those
girls
and
work
them
my
god
mary
harry
hall
wife
of
course
that
was
out
of
the
question
wife
for
she
could
not
bring
her
two
children
there
and
she
had
no
one
to
leave
them
with
and
so
she
went
away
and
i
looked
after
her
and
those
little
bits
of
children
till
they
were
out
of
sight
trying
to
devise
some
way
to
get
her
employment
can
not
you
think
of
anything
mary
are
there
no
ladies
you
know
who
would
give
her
nice
needlework
i
do
know
anybody
but
slade
replied
mary
who
puts
out
work
of
any
consequence
and
she
told
me
the
other
day
that
she
never
employed
any
of
those
persons
who
seen
better
days
that
somehow
she
could
drive
as
good
a
bargain
with
them
as
she
could
with
a
common
person
who
was
ignorant
of
the
value
of
their
labor
god
help
poor
hall
then
exclaimed
harry
if
the
sex
are
as
heartless
must
contrive
some
way
to
help
her
mary
help
her
to
i
mean
for
i
know
her
well
enough
to
be
sure
that
she
would
accept
of
assistance
in
no
other
way
chapter
xli
is
this
the
house
said
one
of
two
ladies
pausing
before
lodgings
i
suppose
so
replied
the
other
lady
they
said
it
was
no
street
but
it
ca
be
either
ruth
hall
could
live
in
such
a
place
as
this
just
look
at
that
irish
girl
leaning
out
the
front
window
on
her
elbows
and
see
those
vulgar
red
curtains
i
declare
mary
if
ruth
hall
has
got
down
hill
so
far
as
this
keep
up
her
acquaintance
just
see
how
they
stare
at
us
here
if
you
choose
to
call
you
may
faugh
just
smell
that
odor
of
cabbage
issuing
from
the
first
entry
come
come
mary
take
your
hand
off
the
knocker
i
would
be
seen
in
that
vulgar
house
for
a
kingdom
it
seems
though
said
the
other
lady
blushing
slightly
as
she
gathered
up
her
six
flounces
in
her
delicately
do
you
remember
the
afternoon
we
rode
out
to
their
pretty
and
had
that
delicious
supper
of
strawberries
and
cream
under
those
old
trees
and
do
you
remember
how
handsome
and
picturesque
her
husband
looked
in
that
broad
panama
hat
raking
up
the
hay
when
the
came
up
and
how
happy
ruth
looked
and
her
children
is
a
dreadful
change
for
her
i
declare
if
it
were
me
i
believe
i
should
cut
my
throat
that
is
probably
just
what
her
relatives
would
like
to
have
her
do
replied
mary
laughing
they
are
as
much
mortified
at
her
being
here
as
you
and
i
are
to
be
seen
in
such
a
quarter
of
the
city
why
do
they
provide
for
her
then
said
the
other
lady
at
least
till
she
can
turn
round
that
youngest
child
is
only
a
baby
yet
oh
that
affair
answered
mary
do
bother
about
it
hyacinth
has
just
married
a
rich
fashionable
wife
and
of
course
he
can
not
lose
caste
by
associating
with
ruth
now
you
can
not
blame
him
well
that
do
prevent
him
from
her
does
it
good
gracious
gertrude
do
stop
if
there
anything
i
hate
it
is
an
argument
it
is
clearly
none
of
our
business
to
take
her
up
if
her
own
people
do
do
it
come
go
to
la
temps
with
me
and
get
an
ice
what
a
love
of
a
collar
you
have
on
it
is
handsomer
than
mine
which
i
gave
fifty
dollars
for
but
what
is
fifty
dollars
when
one
fancies
a
thing
if
i
did
make
my
husband
money
fly
his
second
wife
would
so
i
will
save
her
ladyship
that
trouble
and
with
an
arch
toss
of
her
plumed
head
the
speaker
and
her
companion
entered
the
famous
saloon
of
la
temps
where
might
be
seen
any
sunny
day
between
the
hours
of
twelve
and
three
the
disgusting
spectacle
of
scores
of
ladies
devouring
roman
punch
charlotte
russe
pies
cakes
and
ices
and
sipping
parfait
amour
till
their
flushed
cheeks
and
emancipated
tongues
prepared
them
to
listen
and
reply
to
any
amount
of
questionable
nonsense
from
their
attendant

something
for

said
the
to
ruth
omitting
the
ceremony
of
a
premonitory
knock
as
she
opened
the
door
a
bunch
of
flowers
handsome
enough
for
queen
victory
and
a
basket
of
apples
all
done
up
in
green
leaves
it
takes

said
the
girl
stowing
away
her
tongue
in
her
left
cheek
as
she
partially
closed
the
door
oh
how
pretty
exclaimed
little
nettie
to
whom
those
flowers
were
as
fair
as

dear
they

said
ruth
there
must
be
some
mistake
not
a
bit
said
the
girl
thrusting
her
head
into
the
door
the
boy
said
they
were
ruth

as
plain
as
the
nose
on
my
face
and
that
plain
enough
for
i
reckon
i
should
have
got
married
long
ago
if
it
had
been
for
my
big
nose
he
was
a
country
boy
like
with
a
ploughman
frock
on
and
was
as

david

no
response
from

the

one
of
whose
pleasant
peculiarities
it
was
never
to
answer
a
question
till
the
next
day
after
it
was
addressed
to
him
millet
quite
broken
in

it

i
am
anxious
that
all

should
be
of

hyacinth

often

how
much
it
made

marred

fortune
the

he
associated
with

has
the
air
of
a

already
you
see
now

the

advice
to
us
about
five
years
ago
to
move
into
a
more
fashionable
neighborhood
to
be
sure
rents
are
rather
high
here

i

very
sure
young

would
never

thought
of
offering
himself
to

had
not
we
lived

hyacinth
considers
it
a
great
catch
in
point
of
family
and
i
have
no
doubt
snyder
is
a
nice
fellow
i
wish
before
you
go
millet
you
would
leave
the
money
to
buy
leila
a
velvet
jacket
it
will
not
cost
more
than
forty
dollars
lace
trimmings
and
all
it
will
be
very
becoming
to
leila

tell
you
that
ruth

was
here
this

bothering
me
just
as
i
was
dressing
my

for
dinner
it
seems
that
he
is
getting
tired
of
furnishing
the
allowance
he
promised
to
give
ruth
and
says
that
it
is
turn
now
to
do
something
he
is
a
great
deal
better
off
than
we
are
and
so
i
told
him
and
also
that
we
were
obliged
to
live
in
a
certain
style
for
the
dear
children
sake
beside
are
we
doing
something
for

i
allow
ruth
to
do
her
washing
in

every

provided
she
finds
her

stop
a

leave
the

dollars
for
leila
jacket
before
you
go

the

wants
her
to
sit
for

quite
a

he

charges
three
hundred

his

slowly
and
oracularly
who
being
on
several
school
committees
thought
it
his

to
make
an
extra
exertion
when
the

buttoning
the

of

he
moved
slowly
out

down

to
his

over

my

giddy
with

disoblige
her

then
bring
your

very
careful
crossing

i
can

said
katy
struggling
bravely
with
her
reluctance
as
she
kissed
her
mother
cheek
and
smiled
a
but
when
she
gained
the
crowded
street
the
smile
faded
away
from
the
little
face
her
steps
were
slow
and
her
eyes
downcast
for
katy
child
as
she
was
knew
that
her
grandfather
was
never
glad
to
see
them
now
and
his
strange
cold
tone
when
he
spoke
to
her
always
made
her
shiver
so
little
katy
threaded
her
way
along
with
a
troubled
anxious
look
never
glancing
in
at
the
shopkeepers
tempting
windows
and
quite
forgetting
johnny
galt
pretty
bunch
of
flowers
till
she
stood
trembling
with
her
hand
on
the
latch
of
her
grandfather
door
that
said
her
grandfather
gruffly
from
under
his
bent
brows
come
for
money
do
you
think
your
grandfather
is
made
of
money
people
have
to
it
did
you
know
that
i
worked
hard
to
earn
mine
have
you
done
any
thing
to
earn
this
no
sir
said
katy
with
a
culprit
look
twisting
the
corner
of
her
apron
and
struggling
to
keep
from
crying
why
do
your
mother
go
to
work
and
earn
something
asked
ellet
she
can
not
get
any
work
to
do
replied
katy
she
tries
very
hard
grandpa
well
tell
her
to
trying
and
you
must
grow
up
quick
and
earn
something
too
money
do
grow
on
trees
or
bushes
did
you
know
that
what
the
reason
your
mother
did
come
after
it
herself
hey
she
is
sick
said
katy
seems
to
me
she
always
sick
well
there
a
dollar
said
her
grandfather
looking
at
the
bill
affectionately
as
he
parted
with
it
if
you
keep
on
coming
here
at
this
rate
you
will
get
all
my
money
away
do
you
think
it
is
right
to
come
and
get
all
my
money
away
hey
remember
now
you
and
your
mother
must
earn
some
d
hear
yes
sir
said
katy
meekly
as
she
closed
the
door
there
was
a
great
noise
and
bustle
in
the
street
and
katy
was
jostled
hither
and
thither
by
the
hurrying
foot
passengers
but
she
did
not
heed
it
she
was
so
busy
thinking
of
what
her
grandfather
had
said
and
wondering
if
she
could
not
sell
matches
or
shavings
or
sweep
the
crossings
or
earn
some
pennies
somehow
that
she
need
never
go
to
her
grandfather
again
just
then
a
little
girl
her
own
age
came
skipping
and
smiling
along
holding
her
father
hand
katy
looked
at
her
and
thought
of
father
and
then
she
began
to
cry
what
is
the
matter
my
dear
said
a
gentleman
lifting
a
handful
of
katy
shining
curls
from
her
face
why
do
you
cry
my
dear
i
want
papa
sobbed
katy
where

me

i
will
take
you
to
him

i
if
you
please

said
katy
innocently
he
has
gone
to

you
said
the
gentleman
with
moistened
eyes
where
had
you
been
when
i
met
you
please
sir
i
i
i
had
rather
not
tell
replied
katy
with
a
crimson
blush
very
odd
this
muttered
the
gentleman
what
is
your
name
dear
katy
sir
katy
what
asked
the

i

for
your
voice

the

thoughtfully

said
katy
was
he
tall
and
handsome
with
black
hair
and
whiskers
oh

replied
katy
with
sparkling
eyes
did
he
live
at
a
place
called
glen
just
out
of
the
city
yes
said
katy
my
child
my
poor
child
said
the
gentleman
taking
her
up
in
his
arms
and
pushing
back
her
hair
from
her
face
yes
here
is
papa
brow
and
his
clear
blue
eyes
katy
i
used
to
know
your
dear
papa
yes
said
katy
with
a
bright
glad
smile
i
used
to
go
to
his
to
talk
to
him
on
business
and
i
learned
to
love
him
very
much
too
i
never
saw
your
mamma
though
i
often
heard
him
speak
of
her
in
a
few
hours
dear
i
am
going
to
sail
off
on
the
great
ocean
else
i
would
go
home
with
you
and
see
your
mamma
where
do
you
live
katy
in
court
said
the
child
the
gentleman
colored
and
started
then
putting
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
drawing
out
something
that
looked
like
paper
slipped
it
into
little
katy
bag
saying
with
delicate
tact
tell
your
mamma
my
dear
that
is
something
i
owed
your
dear
papa
mind
you
carry
it
home
safely
now
give
me
a
kiss
and
may
god
forever
bless
you
my
darling
little
katy
stood
shading
her
eyes
with
her
hand
till
the
gentleman
was
out
of
sight
it
was
so
nice
to
see
somebody
who
loved
papa
and
then
she
wondered
why
her
grandfather
never
spoke
so
to
her
about
him
and
then
she
wished
the
kind
gentleman
were
her
grandpapa
and
then
she
wondered
what
it
was
he
had
put
in
the
bag
for
mamma
and
then
she
recollected
that
her
mamma
told
her
not
to
loiter
and
then
she
quickened
her
tardy
little
feet

katy
had
been
gone
now
a
long
while
ruth
began
to
grow
anxious
she
lifted
her
head
from
the
pillow
took
off
the
wet
bandage
from
her
aching
forehead
and
taking
little
nettie
upon
her
lap
sat
down
at
the
small
window
to
watch
for
katy
the
prospect
was
not
one
to
call
up
cheerful
fancies
opposite
was
one
of
those
large
brick
tenements
let
out
by
rapacious
landlords
a
room
at
a
time
at
griping
rents
to
poor
emigrants
and
others
who
were
barely
able
to
prolong
their
lease
of
life
from
day
to
day
at
one
window
sat
a
tailor
with
his
legs
crossed
and
a
torn
straw
hat
perched
awry
upon
his
head
cutting
and
making
coarse
garments
for
the
small
in
the
vicinity
whose
jewish
owner
reaped
all
the
profits
at
another
a
woman
with
a
handkerchief
bound
round
her
aching
face
bent
over
a
steaming
while
a
little
girl
of
ten
staggering
under
the
weight
of
a
basket
of
damp
clothes
was
stringing
them
on
lines
across
the
room
to
dry
at
the
next
window
sat
a
decrepit
old
woman
feebly
trying
to
soothe
in
her
palsied
arms
the
wailings
of
a
poor
sick
child
and
there
too
sat
a
young
girl
from
dawn
till
dark
scarcely
lifting
that
pallid
face
and
weary
eyes
stitching
and
thinking
thinking
and
stitching
god
help
her
still
tier
above
tier
the
windows
rose
full
of
pale
anxious
faces
never
a
laugh
never
a
song
but
instead
ribald
curses
and
the
cries
of
neglected
children
from
window
to
window
outside
were
strung
on
lines
articles
of
clothing
pails
baskets
pillows
and
torn
coverlets
while
up
and
down
the
in
and
out
passed
ever
a
ragged
procession
of
women
and
children
to
the
small
grocery
opposite
for
a
pint
of
milk
a
loaf
of
bread
a
few
onions
or
potatoes
a
cabbage
some
herrings
a
sixpence
worth
of
poor
tea
a
pound
of
musty
flour
a
few
candles
or
a
peck
of
coal
for
all
of
which
the
poor
creatures
paid
twice
as
much
as
if
they
had
the
means
to
buy
by
the
quantity
the
only
window
which
ruth
did
not
shudder
to
look
at
was
the
upper
one
of
all
inhabited
by
a
large
but
thrifty
german
family
whose
love
of
flowers
had
taken
root
even
in
that
sterile
soil
and
whose
little
pot
of
thriving
foreign
shrubs
outside
the
window
sill
showed
with
what
tenacity
the
heart
will
cling
to
early
associations
further
on
at
one
block
remove
was
a
more
house
the
blinds
of
which
were
almost
always
closed
save
when
the
colored
servants
threw
them
open
once
a
day
to
give
the
rooms
an
airing
then
ruth
saw
damask
chairs
satin
curtains
pictures
vases
books
and
pianos
it
was
odd
that
people
who
could
afford
such
things
should
live
in
such
a
neighborhood
ruth
looked
and
wondered
throngs
of
visitors
went
there
carriages
rolled
up
to
the
door
and
rolled
away
men
business
men
family
men
and
young
men
while
boys
loitered
about
the
premises
looking
mysteriously
into
the
door
when
it
opened
or
into
the
window
when
a
curtain
was
raised
or
a
blind
flew
apart
now
and
then
a
woman
appeared
at
the
windows
sometimes
the
face
was
young
and
fair
sometimes
it
was
wan
and
haggard
but
oh
god
never
without
the
stain
that
the
bitterest
tear
may
fail
to
wash
away
save
in
the
eyes
of
him
whose
voice
of
mercy
whispered
go
and
sin
no
more
ruth
tears
fell
fast
she
knew
now
how
it
could
be
when
every
door
of
hope
seemed
shut
by
those
who
make
long
prayers
and
wrap
themselves
in
morality
as
with
a
garment
and
cry
with
closed
purses
and
averted
faces
be
ye
warmed
and
filled
she
knew
now
how
when
the
heart
craving
sympathy
craving
companionship
doubting
both
earth
and
heaven
may
wreck
its
all
in
one
despairing
moment
on
that
dark
sea
if
it
lose
sight
of
bethlehem
and
then
she
thought
if
he
who
saveth
a
soul
from
death
shall
hide
a
multitude
of
sins
oh
where
in
the
great
shall
be

dear
child
i
am
so
glad
you
are
home
said
ruth
as
katy
opened
the
door
i
began
to
fear
something
had
happened
to
you
did
you
see
your
grandfather
oh
mother
exclaimed
katy
please
never
send
me
to
my
grandpa
again
he
said
we
get
away
all
the
money
he
had
and
he
looked
so
dreadful
when
he
said
it
that
it
made
my
knees
tremble
is
it
stealing
mamma
for
us
to
take
grandpa
money
away
no
replied
ruth
looking
a
hue
more
pallid
if
possible
than
before
no
no
katy
do
cry
you
shall
never
go
there
again
for
money
but
where
is
your
bag
why
what
this
katy
grandpa
has
made
a
mistake
you
must
run
right
back
as
quick
as
ever
you
can
with
this
money
or
afraid
he
will
be
angry
oh
grandpa
did
give
me
that
said
katy
a
gentleman
gave
me
that
a
gentleman
said
ruth
why
it
is
katy
how
came
you
to
take
money
from
a
gentleman
who
was
he
money
exclaimed
katy
money
clapping
her
hands
oh
i
so
glad
he
did
say
it
was
money
he
said
it
was
something
he
owed
papa
and
little
katy
picked
up
a
card
from
the
floor

me
trunk
and
ye
see
i
ca
be
staying
when
things
is
as
they
is
the
incessant
cries
of
skiddy
bereaved
baby
soon
bore
ample
testimony
to
the
truth
of
biddy
narration
appealing
to
motherly
sympathies
so
vehemently
that
she
left
her
room
and
went
down
to
offer
her
assistance
there
sat
john
skiddy
the
forlorn
widower
the
ambitious
californian
in
the
middle
of
the
kitchen
in
his
absconded
trotting
a
seven
months
baby
on
the
sharp
apex
of
his
knee
alternately
singing
whistling
and
wiping
the
perspiration
from
his
forehead
while
the
little
skiddy
threw
up
its
arms
in
the
most
frantic
way
and
held
its
breath
with
rage
at
the
awkward
attempts
of
its
dry
nurse
to
restore
peace
to
the
family
let
me
sweeten
a
little
cream
and
water
and
feed
that
child
for
you
skiddy
said
ruth
i
think
he
is
hungry
oh
thank
you
hall
said
skiddy
with
a
man
determined
aversion
to
owning
i
am
getting
along
famously
with
the
little
darling
papa
feed
him
so
he
said
skiddy
and
turning
the
maddened
baby
flat
on
his
back
he
poured
down
a
whole
of
the
liquid
at
once
the
natural
consequence
of
which
was
a
milky
on
his
face
neckcloth
and
vest
from
the
irritated
baby
who
resented
the
insult
with
all
his
mother
spirit
ruth
adroitly
looked
out
the
window
while
skiddy
wiped
his
face
and
sopped
his
neckcloth
after
which
she
busied
herself
in
picking
up
the
ladles
spoons
forks
mortars
pestles
and
other
culinary
implements
with
which
the
floor
was
strewn
in
the
vain
attempt
to
propitiate
the
distracted
infant
i
think
i
spare
the
little
dear
to
you
a
few
minutes
said
skiddy
with
a
ghastly
attempt
at
a
smile
while
i
run
over
to
the
bakery
to
get
a
loaf
for
tea
skiddy
has
probably
been
unexpectedly
detained
and
biddy
is
so
afraid
of
her
labor
in
her
absence
that
she
has
taken
french
leave
i
shall
be
back
soon
said
skiddy
turning
away
in
disgust
from
the
as
he
caught
sight
of
his
limpsey
dicky
and
collapsed
ruth
took
the
poor
worried
baby
tenderly
laid
it
on
its
stomach
across
her
lap
then
loosening
its
frock
strings
began
rubbing
its
little
fat
shoulders
with
her
velvet
palm
there
was
a
maternal
magnetism
in
that
touch
baby
knew
it
he
stopped
crying
and
winked
his
swollen
eyelids
with
the
most
luxurious
satisfaction
as
much
as
to
say
there
now
that
something
like
gently
ruth
drew
first
one
then
the
other
of
the
magnetized
chubby
arms
from
its
frock
sleeves
substituting
a
comfortable
loose
for
the
tight
and
heated
frock
then
she
carefully
drew
off
its
shoe
admiring
the
while
the
beauty
of
the
little
blue
veined
dimpled
foot
while
katy
hush
as
any
mouse
looked
on
delightedly
from
her
little
cricket
on
the
hearth
and
nettie
less
philosophical
was
more
than
half
inclined
to
cry
at
what
she
considered
an
infringement
of
her
rights
skiddy
reflections
as
he
walked
to
the
bakery
were
of
a
motley
character
upon
the
whole
he
inclined
to
the
opinion
that
it
was
not
good
for
man
to
be
alone
especially
with
a
nursing
baby
the
premeditated
and
unmixed
malice
of
skiddy
in
leaving
the
baby
instead
of
sammy
or
johnny
was
beyond
question
still
he
could
not
believe
that
her
desire
for
revenge
would
outweigh
all
her
maternal
feelings
she
would
return
but
where
could
she
have
gone
people
can
not
travel
with
an
empty
purse
but
perhaps
even
now
at
some
tantalizing
point
of
contiguity
she
was
laughing
at
the
success
of
her
nefarious
scheme
and
skiddy
face
reddened
at
the
thought
and
his
arms
instinctively
took
an
attitude
but
then
perhaps
she
to
come
back
what
was
he
to
do
with
that
baby
a
would
cost
him
six
dollars
a
week
and
as
to
bringing
up
little
tommy
by
hand
city
milk
would
soon
finish
him
and
to
do
skiddy
justice
though
no
socrates
he
was
a
good
father
to
his
children
and
now
it
was
nearly
dark
was
he
doomed
to
sit
up
all
night
tired
as
he
was
with
tommy
in
one
hand
and
a
spoon
and
pewter
porringer
in
the
other
or
worse
still
walk
the
floor
in
white
array
till
his
joints
candle
and
patience
gave
out
then
there
were
the
boarders
to
be
seen
to
he
never
realized
before
how
irons
skiddy
had
daily
in
the
fire
there
was
thompson
and
johnson
on
the
first
floor
and
his
face
grew
hot
as
he
thought
of
it
had
seen
him
in
the
kitchen
looking
so
as
he
superintended
pots
kettles
and
stews
there
was
not
a
dry
thread
on
him
that
minute
although
a
cold
north
wind
was
blowing
never
mind
he
was
not
such
a
fool
as
to
tell
of
his
little
troubles
so
he
entered
the
bakery
and
bought
an
extra
pie
and
a
loaf
of
for
tea
to
hoodwink
the
boarders
into
the
belief
that
skiddy
presence
was
not
at
all
necessary
to
a
table
tea
went
off
quite
swimmingly
with
john
skiddy
at
the
urn
the
baby
thanks
to
ruth
maternal
management
lay
sweetly
sleeping
in
his
little
wicker
cradle
dreaming
of
a
distant
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
and
as
if
he
was
destined
to
a
protracted
nap
although
it
was
very
perceptible
that
skiddy
looked
anxious
when
a
door
was
shut
hard
or
a
knife
or
fork
dropped
on
the
table
and
he
had
several
times
been
seen
to
close
his
teeth
tightly
over
his
lip
when
a
heavy
cart
rumbled
mercilessly
past
tea
being
over
the
boarders
dispersed
their
various
ways
ruth
notifying
skiddy
of
her
willingness
to
take
the
child
whenever
it
became
unmanageable
then
skiddy
very
gingerly
and
with
a
tread
put
away
the
muttering
an
imprecation
at
the
lid
of
the
as
he
went
for
falling
off
then
drawing
the
evening
paper
from
his
pocket
and
unfurling
it
with
one
eye
on
the
cradle
he
put
up
his
weary
legs
and
commenced
reading
the
news
hark
a
muffled
noise
from
the
cradle
skiddy
started
and
applied
his
toe
vigorously
to
the
rocker
it
was
no
use
he
whistled
it
suit
he
sang
it
was
a
decided
failure
little
skiddy
had
caught
sight
of
the
pretty
bright
candle
and
it
was
his
present
intention
to
scream
till
he
was
taken
up
to
investigate
it
miserable
skiddy
he
recollected
now
alas
too
late
that
skiddy
always
carefully
screened
the
light
from
tommy
eyes
while
sleeping
he
began
to
be
conscious
of
a
growing
respect
for
skiddy
and
a
growing
aversion
to
baby
yes
in
that
moment
of
vexation
with
that
unread
evening
paper
before
him
he
actually
called
it
baby
how
the
victimized
man
worried
through
the
long
evening
and
night
how
he
tried
to
propitiate
the
little
tempest
with
the
castor
the
its
mother
and
last
but
not
least
a
silver
cup
he
had
received
for
his
valor
from
the
atlantic
fire
company
how
the
baby
like
dickens
young
hero
kept
asking
for
more
how
he
laid
it
on
its
back
and
laid
it
on
its
side
and
laid
it
on
its
stomach
and
propped
it
up
on
one
end
in
a
house
made
of
pillows
and
placed
the
candle
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
in
the
vain
hope
that
that
luminary
might
be
graciously
deemed
by
the
infant
tyrant
a
substitute
for
his
individual
exertions
and
how
regardless
of
all
these
philanthropic
efforts
little
skiddy
stretched
out
his
arms
imploringly
and
rooted
suggestively
at
his
father
breast
in
a
way
to
move
a
heart
of
stone
and
how
skiddy
said
several
words
not
to
be
found
in
the
catechism
and
how
the
daylight
found
him
as
pale
as
a
potato
sprout
in
a
cellar
with
all
sorts
of
diagonal
lines
tattoed
over
his
face
by
enraged
little
finger
nails
and
how
the
little
horn
that
for
years
had
curled
up
so
gracefully
toward
his
nose
was
missing
from
the
corner
of
his
moustache
are
they
not
all
written
in
the
ambitious
californian
repentant
memory
chapter
xlviii
how
sweetly
they
sleep
said
ruth
shading
the
small
lamp
with
her
hand
and
gazing
at
katy
and
nettie
god
grant
names
be
not
written
widow
and
smoothing
back
the
damp
tresses
from
the
brow
of
each
little
sleeper
she
sat
down
to
the
table
and
drawing
from
it
a
piece
of
fine
work
commenced
sewing
only
fifty
cents
for
all
this
ruffling
and
hemming
said
ruth
as
she
picked
up
the
wick
of
her
dim
lamp
only
fifty
cents
and
i
have
labored
diligently
too
every
spare
moment
for
a
fortnight
this
will
never
do
and
she
glanced
at
the
little
bed
must
be
clothed
and
fed
and
educated
educated
an
idea
struck
ruth
why
could
not
she
teach
school
but
who
would
be
responsible
for
the
rent
of
her
room
there
was
fuel
to
be
furnished
and
benches
what
capital
had
to
start
with
there
was
millet
to
be
sure
and
her
father
who
though
they
were
always
saying
something
to
do
would
never
assist
her
when
she
tried
to
do
anything
how
easy
for
them
to
help
her
to
obtain
a
few
scholars
or
be
responsible
for
her
rent
till
she
could
make
a
little
headway
ruth
resolved
at
least
to
mention
her
project
to
millet
who
could
then
if
she
felt
inclined
have
an
opportunity
to
offer
her
assistance
in
this
way
the
following
monday
when
her
washing
was
finished
ruth
wiped
the
suds
from
her
parboiled
fingers
on
the
kitchen
roller
and
ascending
the
stairs
knocked
at
the
door
of
her
cousin
chamber
millet
was
just
putting
the
finishing
touches
to
the
sleeves
of
a
rich
silk
dress
of
leila
which
the
had
just
returned
how
d
do
ruth
said
she
in
a
tone
which
implied
what
on
earth
do
you
want
now
very
well
i
thank
you
said
ruth
with
that
sudden
sinking
at
the
heart
which
even
the
of
a
voice
may
sometimes
give
i
can
only
stay
a
few
minutes
i
stopped
to
ask
you
if
you
thought
there
was
any
probability
of
success
should
i
attempt
to
get
a
private
school
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
your
trying
replied
millet
carelessly
other
widows
have
supported
themselves
there
was
mrs
snow
ruth
sighed
for
she
knew
that
mrs
snow
relatives
had
given
her
letters
of
introduction
to
influential
families
and
helped
her
in
various
ways
till
she
could
get
her
head
above
water
yes
continued
millet
laying
her
daughter
silk
dress
on
the
bed
and
stepping
back
a
pace
or
two
with
her
head
on
one
side
to
mark
the
effect
of
the
satin
bow
she
had
been
arranging
yes
other
widows
support
themselves
though
i
am
sure
i
do
know
how
they
do
it
i
suppose
there
must
be
a
way
leila
is
that
bow
right
seems
to
me
the
dress
needs
a
yard
or
two
more
lace
ten
dollars
will
not
make
much
difference
it
will
be
such
an
improvement
of
course
not
said
leila
it
will
be
a
very
great
improvement
and
by
the
way
ruth
do
you
want
to
sell
me
that
coral
pin
you
used
to
wear
it
would
look
very
pretty
with
this
green
dress
it
was
gift
said
ruth
yes
replied
leila
but
i
thought
you
be
very
glad
to
part
with
it
for
a
flush
passed
over
ruth
face
not
leila
she
replied
for
everything
that
once
belonged
to
harry
is
precious
though
i
might
feel
necessitated
to
part
with
it
in
my
present
circumstances
well
then
said
millet
touching
her
daughter
elbow
better
have
it
leila
harry
gave
ten
dollars
for
it
said
ruth
yes
i
dare
say
replied
millet
but
nobody
expects
to
get
much
for
things
leila
will
give
you
a
dollar
and
a
quarter
for
it
and
she
would
like
it
soon
because
when
this
storm
blows
over
she
wants
to
make
a
few
calls
on
relatives
in
this
very
becoming
silk
dress
and
millet
patted
leila
on
the
shoulder
said
ruth
do
forget
the
brooch
said
leila
i
wish
ruth
would
go
off
into
the
country
or
somewhere
remarked
leila
as
ruth
closed
the
door
i
have
been
expecting
every
day
that
snyder
would
hear
of
her
offering
to
make
caps
in
that
he
is
so
fastidious
about
such
things
being
connected
with
the
tidmarshes
and
that
set
you
know
yes
said
leila
elder
brother
john
a
young
whose
collegiate
and
medical
education
enabled
him
one
morning
to
astound
the
family
with
the
astute
information
that
vinegar
was
an
acid
yes
i
wish
she
would
take
herself
off
into
the
country
too
i
had
as
lief
see
a
new
doctor
sign
put
up
next
door
as
to
see
her
face
of
a
monday
over
that
in
our
kitchen
i
wonder
if
she
thinks
salt
an
improvement
in
for
the
last
time
i
saw
her
there
she
was
dropping
in
the
tears
on
her
clothes
as
she
scrubbed
at
a
showering
rate
another
thing
mother
i
wish
you
would
give
her
a
lesson
or
two
about
those
children
of
hers
the
other
day
i
met
her
katy
in
the
street
with
the
shabbiest
old
bonnet
on
and
the
toes
of
her
shoes
all
rubbed
white
and
she
had
the
impertinence
to
call
me
john
in
the
hearing
of
young
gerald
who
has
just
returned
from
abroad
and
who
dined
with
lord
malden
in
paris
i
could
have
wrung
the
little
wretch
neck
it
provoking
john
i
speak
to
her
about
it
said
millet
when
she
brings
the
coral
pin
chapter
xlix
ruth
after
a
sleepless
night
of
reflection
upon
her
new
project
started
in
the
morning
in
quest
of
pupils
she
had
no
permission
to
refer
either
to
her
father
or
to
millet
and
such
being
the
case
the
very
fact
of
her
requesting
this
favor
of
any
one
less
nearly
related
would
be
of
itself
sufficient
to
cast
suspicion
upon
her
some
of
the
ladies
upon
whom
she
called
were
out
some
engaged
some
indisposed
and
all
indifferent
besides
people
are
not
apt
to
entrust
their
children
with
a
person
of
whom
they
know
nothing
ruth
keenly
felt
this
disadvantage
one
lady
on
whom
she
called
never
sent
her
children
where
the
teacher
own
children
were
taught
another
preferred
foreign
teachers
it
was
something
to
say
that
alfred
and
alfrida
were
at
signor
vicchi
establishment
another
after
putting
ruth
through
the
catechism
as
to
her
private
history
and
torturing
her
with
the
most
minute
inquiries
as
to
her
past
present
and
future
coolly
informed
her
that
she
had
no
children
to
send
after
hours
of
fruitless
searching
ruth
and
returned
to
her
lodgings
that
day
at
dinner
some
one
of
the
boarders
spoke
of
a
young
girl
who
had
been
taken
to
the
hospital
in
a
consumption
contracted
by
teaching
a
primary
school
in
street
the
situation
was
vacant
perhaps
she
could
get
it
certainly
her
education
to
qualify
her
to
satisfy
any
school
committee
ruth
inquired
who
they
were
one
was
her
cousin
millet
the
wooden
man
one
was
develin
the
literary
bookseller
the
two
others
were
strangers
millet
and
develin
and
both
aware
how
earnestly
she
longed
for
employment
ruth
looked
at
her
children
yes
for
their
sake
she
would
even
go
to
the
wooden
man
and
develin
and
ask
if
it
were
not
possible
for
her
to
obtain
the
vacant
primary
school
chapter
millet
sat
in
his
counting
room
with
his
pen
behind
his
ear
examining
his
ledger
do
said
he
concisely
by
way
of
salutation
as
ruth
entered
i
understand
there
is
a
vacancy
in
the
ward
primary
school
said
ruth
can
you
tell
me
as
you
are
one
of
the
committee
for
that
district
if
there
is
any
prospect
of
my
obtaining
it
and
how
i
shall
manage
to
do
so
said
millet
when
is
the
examination
of
applicants
to
take
place
asked
ruth
replied
the
statue
at
what
place
asked
ruth
responded
the
wooden
man
making
an
entry
in
his
ledger
ruth
heroic
resolutions
to
ask
him
to
use
his
influence
in
her
behalf
vanished
into
thin
air
at
this
icy
reserve
and
passing
out
into
the
street
she
bent
her
slow
steps
in
the
direction
of
develin
on
entering
the
door
she
espied
that
gentleman
through
the
glass
door
of
his
sitting
in
his
leathern
with
his
hands
folded
in
an
attitude
of
repose
and
meditation
can
i
speak
to
you
a
moment
said
ruth
lifting
the
latch
of
the
door
well
yes
certainly
hall
replied
develin
seizing
a
package
of
letters
it
is
an
uncommon
busy
time
with
me
but
yes
certainly
if
you
have
anything
to
say
ruth
mentioned
in
as
few
words
as
possible
the
primary
school
and
her
hopes
of
obtaining
it
develin
meanwhile
opening
the
letters
and
perusing
their
contents
when
she
had
finished
he
said
taking
his
hat
to
go
out
i
do
know
but
you
stand
as
good
a
chance
hall
as
anybody
else
you
can
apply
but
you
must
excuse
me
for
i
have
an
invoice
of
books
to
look
over
immediately
poor
ruth
and
this
was
human
nature
which
for
so
many
sunny
years
of
prosperity
had
turned
to
her
only
its
side
she
was
not
to
be
discouraged
however
and
sent
in
her
application
chapter
li
examination
day
came
and
ruth
bent
her
determined
steps
to
the
city
hall
the
apartment
designated
was
already
crowded
with
waiting
applicants
who
regarded
with
jealous
eye
each
addition
to
their
number
as
so
much
dimunition
of
their
own
individual
chance
for
success
ruth
cheeks
grew
hot
as
their
scrutinizing
and
unfriendly
glances
were
bent
on
her
and
that
feeling
of
utter
desolation
came
over
her
which
was
always
so
overwhelming
whenever
she
presented
herself
as
a
suppliant
for
public
favor
in
truth
it
was
but
a
poor
preparation
for
the
inquisitorial
torture
before
her
the
applicants
were
called
out
one
by
one
in
alphabetical
order
ruth
inwardly
blessing
the
early
nativity
of
the
letter
h
for
these
meditations
were
worse
to
her
than
the
shock
of
a
volley
of
chilling
interrogations
letter
ruth
rose
with
a
flutter
at
her
heart
and
entered
a
huge
room
at
the
further
end
of
which
sat
in
august
state
the
dread
committee
respectable
were
the
gentlemen
of
whom
that
committee
was
composed
was
written
all
over
them
from
the
crowns
of
their
scholastic
heads
to
the
very
tips
of
their
polished
boots
and
correct
and
methodical
as
a
revised
dictionary
they
sat
with
folded
hands
and
noses
ruth
seated
herself
in
the
victim
chair
before
this
august
body
facing
a
flood
of
light
from
a
large
that
nearly
extinguished
her
eyes
what
is
your
age
asked
the
elder
of
the
inquisitors

and
i

fizzle
elevating
his
chin
and
folding
his
arms
pugnaciously
over
his
striped
vest
i
am
acquainted
with
one
of
the
teachers
in

sir
at
this
mr
fizzle
settled
down
behind
his
dicky
with
a
quenched
air
and
the
very
important
question
being
laid
on
the
shelf
squizzle
handing
ruth
a
copy
of
pollock
course
of
time
requested
her
to
read
a
marked
passage
indicated
by
a
perforation
of
his
poor
ruth
stood
about
as
fair
a
chance
of
proving
her
ability
to
read
poetry
as
would
fanny
kemble
to
take
up
a
play
at
one
of
her
dramatic
readings
without
a
previous
opportunity
to
gather
up
the
connecting
thread
our
heroine
however
went
through
the
motions
this
farce
concluded
ruth
was
dismissed
into
the
apartment
in
waiting
to
make
room
for
the
other
applicants
each
of
whom
returned
with
red
faces
moist
foreheads
and
a
air
an
hour
added
suspense
and
the
four
owners
of
the
four
pair
of
inquisitorial
spectacles
marched
in
procession
into
the
room
in
waiting
and
wheeling
face
about
with
military
precision
thumped
on
the
table
and
ejaculated
attention
instantaneously
pair
of
eyes
black
blue
brown
and
gray
were
riveted
and
each
owner
being
supplied
with
pen
ink
and
paper
was
allowed
ten
minutes
with
the
of
spectacles
levelled
full
at
her
to
express
her
thoughts
on
the
following
subject

christopher

standing
up
or
sitting
down
when
he
discovered
america
the
four
watches
of
the
committee
men
being
drawn
out
pencils
began
to
scratch
and
the
terminus
of
the
allotted
minutes
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
was
the
place
for
each
inspired
improvisatrice
to
stop
these
hasty
effusions
being
endorsed
by
appending
each
signature
new
paper
was
furnished
and
was
again
ejaculated
by
a
short
pursy
individual
who
seemed
to
be
struggling
to
get
out
of
his
coat
by
climbing
over
his
shirt
collar
little
armies
of
figures
were
then
rattled
off
from
the
end
of
this
gentleman
tongue
with
peter
piper
pipkin
velocity
which
the
anxious
in
waiting
were
expected
to
arrest
in
flying
and
have
the
sum
total
of
the
hull
as
one
of
the
erudite
committee
observed
already
added
up
when
the
illustrious
arithmetician
stopped
to
take
wind
this
being
the
finale
the
ladies
were
sapiently
informed
that
as
only
school
mistress
was
needed
only
out
of
the
large
number
of
applicants
could
be
elected
and
that
the
committee
would
now
sit
on
them
at
this
gratifying
intelligence
the
ladies
favored
by
a
plentiful
shower
of
rain
betook
themselves
to
their
respective
homes
god
help
them
to
dream
of
a
reprieve
from
starvation
which
notwithstanding
the
purgatory
they
had
passed
through
was
destined
to
elude
their
eager
grasp
the
votes
were
cast
ruth
was
elected
she
had
been
educated
whether
fortunately
or
unfortunately
let
the
sequel
of
my
story
decide
at
a
school
where
webster
was
used
instead
of
worcester
the
greatest
gun
on
the
committee
was
a
worcesterite
millet

develin
always
followed
in
the
wake
of

and
develin
voted

chapter
lii
it
was
four
in
the
afternoon
and
very
tranquil
and
quiet
at
the
skiddy
a
tidy
young
woman
sat
rocking
the
deserted
little
tommy
to
sleep
to
the
tune
of
i
been
roaming
the
hearth
was
neatly
swept
the
tin
and
pewter
vessels
hung
brightly
polished
from
their
respective
shelves
the
maltese
cat
lay
winking
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
watching
the
play
of
a
stray
sunbeam
which
had
found
its
way
over
the
shed
and
into
the
small
window
ruth
and
her
children
were
quiet
as
usual
in
their
gloomy
back
chamber
skiddy
a
few
blocks
off
sat
perched
on
a
high
stool
in
the
of
fogg
noiselessly
the
opened
and
the
veritable
skiddy
followed
by
johnny
and
sammy
crept
through
the
front
entry
and
entered
unannounced
into
the
kitchen
the
young
woman
looked
at
skiddy
skiddy
looked
at
her
and
tommy
looked
at
both
of
them
skiddy
then
boxed
the
young
woman
ears
and
snatching
the
bewildered
baby
from
her
grasp
ejected
her
with
lightning
velocity
through
the
and
turned
the
key
it
was
all
the
work
of
an
instant
sammy
and
johnny
were
used
to
domestic
whirlwinds
so
they
were
not
surprised
into
any
little
remarks
or
exclamations
but
the
cat
less
philosophical
laid
back
her
ears
and
made
for
the
while
skiddy
seating
herself
in
the
unhooked
her
traveling
dress
and
reinstated
the
delighted
tommy
into
all
his
little
infantile
privileges
skiddy
had
now
been
a
whole
week
a
widower
time
enough
for
a
man
in
that
condition
to
grow
philosophical
in
fact
skiddy
was
content
he
had
tasted
the
sweets
of
liberty
and
he
liked
them
the
baby
poor
little
soul
tired
of
remonstrance
had
given
out
from
sheer
weariness
and
took
resignedly
as
a
little
christian
to
his
pewter
porringer
yes
skiddy
liked
it
he
could
be
an
hour
behind
his
time
without
dodging
on
his
return
a
rattling
storm
of
abuse
and
crockery
he
could
spend
an
evening
out
without
drawing
a
map
of
his
travels
before
starting
on
the
afternoon
in
question
he
felt
particularly
felicitous
first
because
he
had
dined
off
fried
liver
and
potatoes
a
dish
which
he
particularly
affected
and
which
on
that
very
account
he
could
seldom
get
in
his
own
domicil
secondly
he
was
engaged
to
go
that
very
evening
with
his
old
love
nancy
spriggins
to
see
the
panorama
of
niagara
and
he
had
left
orders
with
betty
to
have
tea
half
an
hour
earlier
in
consequence
and
to
be
sure
and
iron
and
air
his
killing
plaid
vest
by
seven
as
the
afternoon
waned
skiddy
grew
restless
he
made
wrong
entries
in
the
ledger
dipped
his
pen
into
the
instead
of
the
inkstand
and
several
times
said
yes
dear
to
his
employer
fogg
of
fogg
square
six
came
at
last
and
the
emancipated
skiddy
turning
his
back
on
business
walked
towards
home
in
peace
with
himself
and
in
love
with
nancy
spriggins
on
the
way
he
stopped
to
purchase
a
bouquet
of
roses
and
geraniums
with
which
to
regale
that
damsel
olfactories
during
the
evening
entertainment
striding
through
the
front
entry
like
a
man
who
felt
himself
to
be
master
of
his
own
house
skiddy
hastened
to
the
kitchen
to
expedite
tea
if
he
was
not
prepared
for
skiddy
departure
still
less
was
he
prepared
for
her
return
especially
with
that
bouquet
in
his
hand
but
like
all
other
husbands
on
the
back
of
the
he
fled
away
from
the
uplifted
lash
my
matilda
exclaimed
skiddy
my
own
wife
how
you
be
so
cruel
every
day
since
your
departure
hoping
to
find
you
here
on
my
return
from
the
store
i
have
purchased
a
bouquet
like
this
to
present
you
my
dear
wife
let
my
love
for
you
is
imperishable
good
skiddy
said
his
wife
accepting
nancy
bouquet
with
a
queenly
nod
and
now
let
us
have
no
more
talk
of
if
you
please
mr
skiddy
certainly
not
my
darling
i
was
a
brute
a
beast
a
wretch
a
hottentot
a
cannibal
a
vampire
to
distress
you
so
dear
little
tommy
how
pleasant
it
seems
to
see
him
in
your
arms
again
yes
replied
skiddy
i
was
not
five
minutes
in
sending
that
german
girl
spinning
through
the
i
hope
you
have
something
decent
for
us
to
eat
skiddy
johnny
and
sammy
are
pretty
why
do
you
come
and
speak
to
your
father
boys
the
young
gentlemen
thus
summoned
slowly
came
forward
looking
altogether
undecided
whether
it
was
best
to
notice
their
father
or
not
a
however
and
a
slice
of
buttered
bread
plentifully
powdered
with
sugar
wonderfully
assisted
them
in
coming
to
a
decision
as
to
nancy
spriggins
poor
soul
she
pulled
off
her
gloves
and
pulled
them
on
that
evening
and
looked
at
her
watch
and
looked
up
street
and
down
street
and
declared
as
the
clock
told
the
hour
for
retiring
that
man
was
a
a
in
short
that
woman
was
born
to
trouble
as
the
sparks
are
to
fly
away
skiddy
resumed
her
household
duties
with
as
much
coolness
as
if
there
had
been
no
interregnum
and
received
the
boarders
at
tea
that
night
just
as
if
she
had
parted
with
them
that
day
at
dinner
skiddy
was
apparently
as
devoted
as
ever
the
uninitiated
boarders
opened
their
eyes
in
bewildered
wonder
and
sat
inscribed
on
the
arch
of
skiddy
imposing
roman
nose
the
domestic
horizon
still
continued
cloudless
at
the
next
breakfast
after
the
boarders
had
left
the
table
the
market
prices
of
beef
veal
pork
cutlets
chops
and
steaks
were
discussed
as
usual
the
bill
of
fare
for
the
day
was
drawn
up
by
skiddy
and
her
obedient
spouse
departed
to
execute
her
market
orders
chapter
liii
well
i
hope
you
have
been
comfortable
in
my
absence
hall
said
skiddy
after
despatching
her
husband
to
market
as
she
seated
herself
in
the
chair
nearest
the
door
ha
ha
john
and
i
may
call
it
quits
now
he
is
a
very
good
fellow
john
except
these
little
tantrums
he
gets
into
once
in
a
while
the
only
way
is
to
put
a
stop
to
it
at
once
and
let
him
see
who
is
master
john
never
will
set
a
river
on
fire
there
no
sort
of
use
in
his
trying
to
take
the
reins
the
man
was
born
for
it
i
too
sharp
for
him
that
a
fact
ha
ha
poor
johnny
i
tell
you
what
a
trick
i
played
him
about
two
years
after
our
marriage
you
must
know
he
had
to
go
away
on
business
for
fogg
to
collect
bills
or
something
of
that
sort
well
he
made
a
great
fuss
about
it
as
husbands
who
like
to
go
away
from
home
always
do
and
said
he
should
for
the
sight
of
me
and
never
know
a
happy
hour
till
he
saw
me
again
and
all
that
and
finally
declared
he
would
not
go
without
i
would
let
him
take
my
daguerreotype
of
course
i
knew
that
was
all
humbug
but
i
consented
the
likeness
was
pronounced
and
placed
in
his
travelling
trunk
when
i
packed
his
clothes
well
he
was
gone
a
month
and
when
he
came
back
he
told
me
great
fool
what
a
comfort
my
daguerreotype
was
to
him
and
how
he
had
looked
at
it
twenty
times
a
day
and
kissed
it
as
many
more
whereupon
i
went
to
his
trunk
and
opening
it
took
out
the
case
and
showed
it
to
him
the
which
i
had
taken
care
to
slip
out
of
the
frame
just
before
he
started
and
which
he
had
never
found
out
that
a
specimen
of
john
skiddy
and
john
skiddy
is
a
fair
specimen
of
the
rest
of
his
sex
let
me
tell
you
hall
well
of
course
he
looked
sheepish
enough
and
now
whenever
i
want
to
take
the
nonsense
out
of
him
all
i
have
to
do
is
to
point
to
that
daguerreotype
case
which
i
keep
lying
on
the
mantel
on
purpose
when
a
woman
is
married
hall
she
must
make
up
her
mind
either
to
manage
or
to
be
managed
prefer
to
manage
said
the
amiable
skiddy
and
i
flatter
myself
john
understands
it
by
this
time
but
dear
me
i
ca
stand
here
prating
to
you
all
day
i
must
look
round
and
see
what
mischief
has
been
done
in
my
absence
by
that
german
girl
and
skiddy
laughed
heartily
as
she
related
how
she
had
sent
her
spinning
through
the
front
door
the
night
before
half
the
forenoon
was
occupied
by
skiddy
in
counting
up
spoons
forks
towels
and
baby
pinafores
to
see
if
they
had
sustained
loss
or
damage
during
her
absence
very
odd
dinner
do
come
said
she
consulting
the
kitchen
clock
it
is
high
time
that
beef
was
on
roasting
it
odd
and
odder
still
that
skiddy
had
not
appeared
to
tell
her
the
dinner
did
come
skiddy
wasted
no
time
in
words
about
it
no
she
seized
her
bonnet
and
went
immediately
to
fogg
to
get
some
tidings
of
him
they
were
apparently
quite
as
much
at
a
loss
as
herself
to
account
for
skiddy
she
was
just
departing
when
one
of
the
whom
the
unfortunate
skiddy
had
once
snubbed
whispered
a
word
in
her
ear
the
effect
of
which
was
instantaneous
did
she
let
the
grass
grow
under
her
feet
till
she
tracked
skiddy
to
the
wharf
and
boarded
the
bound
for
california
and
brought
the
crestfallen
man
triumphantly
back
to
his
domicil
amid
convulsions
of
laughter
from
the
amused
captain
and
his
crew
no
there
now
said
his
amiable
spouse
untying
her
bonnet
flash
in
the
pan
skiddy
anybody
who
thinks
to
circumvent
matilda
maria
skiddy
must
get
up
early
in
the
morning
and
find
themselves
too
late
at
that
now
hold
this
child
dumping
the
doomed
baby
into
his
lap
while
i
comb
my
hair
goodness
knows
you
worth
bringing
back
but
when
i
set
out
to
have
my
own
way
skiddy
mount
vesuvius
sha
stop
me
skiddy
tended
the
baby
without
a
remonstrance
he
perfectly
understood
that
for
a
probationary
time
he
should
be
put
on
the
limits
the
being
the
boundary
line
he
heaved
no
sigh
when
his
coat
and
hat
with
the
rest
of
his
wearing
apparel
were
locked
up
and
the
key
buried
in
the
depths
of
his
wife
pocket
he
played
with
tommy
and
made
for
sammy
and
johnny
wound
several
tangled
skeins
of
silk
for
maria
matilda
mended
a
broken
button
on
the
closet
door
replaced
a
missing
knob
on
one
of
the
bureau
drawers
and
appeared
to
be
in
as
resigned
and
proper
a
frame
of
mind
as
such
a
perfidious
wretch
could
be
expected
to
be
in
two
or
three
weeks
passed
in
this
state
of
incarceration
during
which
the
of
fogg
had
been
repeatedly
informed
by
skiddy
that
the
doctor
hoped
skiddy
would
soon
be
sufficiently
convalescent
to
attend
to
business
as
to
skiddy
he
continued
at
intervals
to
shed
crocodile
tears
over
his
past
or
rather
his
in
consequence
of
this
apparently
submissive
frame
of
mind
he
one
fine
morning
received
total
absolution
from
skiddy
and
leave
to
go
to
the
store
which
skiddy
peremptorily
declined
desiring
as
he
said
to
test
the
sincerity
of
his
repentance
by
a
still
longer
period
of
probation
do
be
a
fool
skiddy
said
maria
matilda
pointing
to
the
daguerreotype
case
and
then
crowding
his
beaver
down
over
his
eyes
do
be
a
fool
make
a
b
line
for
the
store
now
and
tell
fogg
had
an
attack
of
and
maria
matilda
laughed
at
her
wretched
pun
skiddy
obeyed
no
uriah
heep
could
have
him
in
as
he
crept
up
the
long
street
until
a
friendly
corner
hid
him
from
the
lynx
eyes
of
maria
matilda

richard

under
full

for

just
one
half
hour
our
napoleon
in
petticoats
spent
in
reflection
after
being
satisfied
that
skiddy
was
really
on
the
deep
blue
sea
in
one
day
she
had
cleared
her
house
of
and
reserving
one
room
for
herself
and
children
filled
all
the
other
apartments
with
who
paid
her
good
prices
and
taking
their
meals
down
town
made
her
no
trouble
beyond
the
care
of
their
respective
rooms
about
a
year
after
a
letter
came
from
skiddy
he
was
disgusted
with
at
and
everywhere
else
he
had
been
burnt
out
and
robbed
and
everything
else
but
murdered
and
requested
his
dear
maria
matilda
to
send
him

at

my

from

filled
with

she
chinked
its

at

shuddered

pointed
to
a
pale
face
pressed
close
against
the
grated
window
fair
rose
the
building
in
its
architectural
proportions
the

was
beautiful
to

but
alas
there
was
helpless
age
whose
only
disease
was
too
long
a
lease
of

for
greedy
heirs
there
too
was
the
fragile
wife
to
whom
was
breath
being
forgotten
by
the
world
and
him
in
whose
service
her
bloom
had
withered
insane
only
in
that
her
love
had
outlived
his
patience
poor
creatures
exclaimed
ruth
as
they
peered
out
from
one
window
after
another
have
you
had
many
deaths
here
asked
she
of
the
some
there
is
one
corpse
in
the

now
a
married
lady
mrs
leon
good
heavens
exclaimed
ruth
my
friend
mary
died
yesterday
her
husband
left
her
here
for
her
health
while
he
went
to
europe
can
i
see
the
superintendent
asked
ruth
i
must
speak
to
him
ruth
followed
the
up
the
ample
steps
into
a
wide
hall
and
from
thence
into
a
small
parlor
after
waiting
what
seemed
to
her
an
age
of
time
tibbetts
the
superintendent
entered
he
was
a
tall
handsome
man
between
forty
and
fifty
with
a
very
imposing
air
and
address
i
am
pained
to
learn
said
ruth
that
a
friend
of
mine
leon
lies
dead
here
can
i
see
the
body
are
you
a
relative
of
that
lady
asked
tibbetts
with
a
keen
glance
at
ruth
no
replied
ruth
but
she
was
very
dear
to
me
the
last
time
i
saw
her
not
many
months
since
she
was
in
tolerable
health
has
she
been
long
with
you
sir
about
two
months
replied
tibbetts
she
was
hopelessly
crazy
refused
food
entirely
so
that
we
were
obliged
to
force
it
her
husband
who
is
an
intimate
friend
of
mine
left
her
under
my
care
and
went
to
the
continent
a
very
fine
man
mr
leon
ruth
did
not
feel
inclined
to
respond
to
this
remark
but
repeated
her
request
to
see
mary
it
is
against
the
rules
of
our
establishment
to
permit
this
to
any
but
relatives
said
tibbetts
i
should
esteem
it
a
great
favor
if
you
would
break
through
your
rules
in
my
case
replied
ruth
it
will
be
a
great
consolation
to
me
to
have
seen
her
once
more
and
her
voice
faltered
the
appeal
was
made
so
gently
yet
so
firmly
that
tibbetts
reluctantly
yielded
the
matron
of
the
establishment
bunce
whose
advent
was
heralded
by
the
clinking
of
a
huge
bunch
of
keys
at
her
waist
soon
after
came
in
bunce
was
gaunt
sallow
and
bony
with
restless
yellowish
glaring
black
eyes
very
much
resembling
those
of
a
cat
in
the
dark
her
motions
were
quick
brisk
and
angular
her
voice
loud
harsh
and
wiry
ruth
felt
an
instantaneous
aversion
to
her
which
was
not
lessened
by
bunce
asking
as
they
passed
through
the
fond
of
looking
at
corpses
i
seen
a
great
many
in
my
day
i
laid
out
twenty
people
first
and
last
with
my
own
hands
relation
of
leon
perhaps
said
she
curiously
peering
under
ruth
bonnet
ah
only
a
friend
this
way
if
you
please
and
on
they
went
through
one
corridor
then
another
the
massive
doors
swinging
heavily
to
on
their
hinges
and
fastening
behind
them
as
they
closed
hark
said
ruth
with
a
quick
terrified
look
what
that
oh
nothing
replied
the
matron
only
a
crazy
woman
in
that
room
yonder
screaming
for
her
child
her
husband
ran
away
from
her
and
carried
off
her
child
with
him
to
spite
her
and
now
she
fancies
every
footstep
she
hears
is
his
visitors
always
thinks
she
screams
awful
she
ca
harm
you
said
the
matron
mistaking
the
cause
of
shudder
for
she
is
chained
she
went
to
law
about
the
child
and
the
law
you
see
as
it
generally
is
was
on
the
man
side
and
it
just
upset
her
she
a
sight
of
trouble
to
manage
if
she
was
to
catch
sight
of
your
little
girl
out
there
in
the
garden
she
spring
at
her
through
them
bars
like
a
panther
but
we
do
have
to
whip
her
often
down
here
said
the
matron
taking
the
shuddering
ruth
by
the
hand
and
descending
a
flight
of
stone
steps
into
a
dark
tired
ar
you
wait
a
bit
please
said
ruth
leaning
against
the
stone
wall
for
her
limbs
were
trembling
so
violently
that
she
could
scarcely
bear
her
weight
said
she
after
a
pause
with
a
firmer
voice
and
step
this
way
said
bunce
advancing
towards
a
rough
deal
box
which
stood
on
a
table
in
a
niche
of
the
cellar
and
setting
a
small
lamp
upon
it
she
did
look
no
better
than
that
for
a
long
while
before
she
died
ruth
gave
one
hurried
glance
at
the
corpse
and
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
well
might
she
fail
to
recognize
in
that
emaciated
form
those
sunken
eyes
and
hollow
cheeks
the
beautiful
mary
leon
well
might
she
shudder
as
the
gibbering
screams
of
the
maniacs
over
head
echoed
through
the
stillness
of
that
cold
gloomy
vault
were
you
with
her
at
the
last
asked
ruth
of
the
matron
wiping
away
her
tears
no
replied
she
the
afternoon
she
died
she
said
want
to
be
alone
and
not
thinking
her
near
her
end
i
took
my
work
and
sat
just
outside
the
door
i
looked
in
once
about
half
an
hour
after
but
she
lay
quietly
asleep
with
her
cheek
in
her
hand
so
i
thought
i
would
speak
to
her
so
i
went
in
and
saw
her
lying
just
as
she
did
when
i
looked
at
her
before
i
spoke
to
her
but
she
did
not
answer
me
she
was
dead
o
how
mournfully
sounded
in
ruth
ears
those
plaintive
words
i
want
to
be
alone
poor
mary
aye
better
even
in
death
than
gazed
at
by
careless
hireling
eyes
since
he
who
should
have
closed
those
drooping
lids
had
wearied
of
their
faded
light
did
she
speak
of
no
one
asked
ruth
mention
no
one
no
yes
i
recollect
now
that
she
said
something
about
calling
ruth
i
did
pay
any
attention
for
they
do
know
what
they
are
saying
you
know
she
scribbled
something
too
on
a
bit
of
paper
i
found
it
under
her
pillow
when
i
laid
her
out
i
should
wonder
if
it
was
in
my
pocket
now
i
have
thought
of
it
since
ah
here
it
is
said
bunce
as
she
handed
the
slip
of
paper
to
ruth
it
ran
thus
i
am
not
crazy
ruth
no
no
but
i
shall
be
the
air
of
this
place
stifles
me
i
grow
weaker
weaker
i
can
not
die
here
for
the
love
of

the
sudden
change
in
skiddy
matrimonial
prospects
necessitated
ruth
to
seek
other
quarters
with
a
view
to
still
more
rigid
economy
she
hired
a
room
without
board
in
the
lower
part
of
the
city
mrs
waters
her
new
landlady
was
one
of
that
description
of
females
whose
vision
is
bounded
by
a
mop
and
who
repudiate
rainy
washing
days
whose
hearth
jowler
on
the
stormiest
night
would
never
venture
near
without
a
special
permit
and
whose
husband
and
children
speak
under
their
breath
on
baking
and
cleaning
days
mrs
waters
styled
herself
a
female
physician
she
kept
a
sort
of
witch
cauldron
constantly
boiling
over
the
fire
in
which
seethed
all
sorts
of
mints
and
yarbs
and
from
which
issued
what
she
called
a
potecary
odor
mrs
waters
when
not
engaged
in
stirring
this
cauldron
or
in
her
various
duties
alternated
her
leisure
in
reading
medical
books
attending
medical
lectures
and
fondling
a
pet
skull
which
lay
on
the
various
little
boxes
of
pills
ornamented
the
upper
shelf
beside
a
row
of
little
dropsical
chunky
junk
bottles
whose
labels
would
have
puzzled
the
most
erudite
who
ever
received
a
diploma
mrs
waters
felicitated
herself
on
knowing
how
the
outer
and
inner
man
of
every
son
of
adam
was
put
together
and
considered
the
times
decidedly
out
of
joint
inasmuch
that
she
mrs
waters
had
not
been
called
upon
by
her
country
to
fill
some
medical
professorship
in
person
mrs
waters
was
and
and
her
taste
in
dress
running
mostly
to
stringy
fabrics
assisted
the
impression
she
created
her
hands
and
wrists
bore
a
strong
resemblance
to
the
yellow
claws
of
defunct
chickens
which
children
play
scare
with
about
thanksgiving
time
her
feet
were
of
turtle
flatness
and
her
eyes
if
you
ever
provoked
a
cat
up
to
the
bristling
and
scratching
point
you
may
possibly
form
an
idea
of
them
mrs
waters
condescended
to
allow
ruth
to
keep
the
quart
of
milk
and
loaf
of
bread
which
was
to
serve
for
her
bill
of
fare
for
every
three
meals
on
a
swing
shelf
in
a
corner
of
the
cellar
as
ruth
room
was
at
the
top
of
the
house
it
was
somewhat
of
a
journey
to
travel
up
and
down
and
the
weather
was
too
warm
to
keep
it
up
stairs
to
her
dismay
she
soon
found
that
the
was
generally
more
or
less
flooded
with
water
and
the
sudden
change
from
the
heated
air
of
her
attic
to
the
dampness
of
the
cellar
brought
on
a
racking
cough
which
soon
told
upon
her
health
upon
the
first
symptom
of
it
mrs
waters
seized
a
box
of
pills
and
hurried
to
her
room
assuring
her
that
it
was
a
sure
cure
and
only
three
shillings
a
box
thank
you
said
ruth
but
it
is
my
rule
never
to
take
medicine
unless
oh
oh
said
mrs
waters
bridling
up
i
see
unless
it
is
ordered
by
a
physician
you
were
going
to
say
perhaps
you
do
know
that
am
a
physician
none
the
worse
for
being
a
female
i
have
investigated
things
i
have
dissected
several
cats
and
sent
in
an
analysis
of
them
to
the
medical
journal
it
has
never
been
published
owing
probably
to
the
editor
being
out
of
town
if
you
will
take
six
of
these
pills
every
other
night
said
the
doctress
laying
the
box
on
the
table
it
will
cure
your
cough
it
is
only
three
shillings
i
will
take
the
money
now
or
charge
it
in
your
bill
three
shillings

aghast
she
might
as
well
have
asked
her
three
dollars
if
there
was
anything
ruth
was
afraid
of
it
was
mrs
waters
style
of
woman
a
loaded
cannon
or
a
regiment
of
dragoons
would
have
had
few
terrors
in
comparison
but
the
music
must
be
faced
so
hoping
to
avoid
treading
on
her
landlady
professional
toes
ruth
said
i
think
i
try
first
what
dieting
will
do
mrs
waters
the
door
instantly
banged
to
with
a
crash
as
the
owner
and
vender
of
the
pills
passed
out
the
next
day
mrs
waters
drew
off
a
little
superfluous
feminine
bile
by
announcing
to
ruth
with
a
malignity
worthy
of
her
sex
that
she
forgot
to
mention
when
she
let
her
lodgings
that
she
should
expect
her
to
scour
the
stairs
she
traveled
over
at
least
once
a
week
chapter
lvi
it
was
a
sultry
morning
in
july
ruth
had
risen
early
for
her
cough
seemed
more
troublesome
in
a
reclining
posture
i
wonder
what
that
noise
can
be
said
she
to
herself
whir
whir
whir
it
went
all
day
long
in
the
attic
overhead
she
knew
that
mrs
waters
had
one
other
lodger
beside
herself
an
elderly
gentleman
by
the
name
of
bond
who
cooked
his
own
food
and
whom
she
often
met
on
the
stairs
coming
up
with
a
pitcher
of
water
or
a
few
eggs
in
a
paper
bag
or
a
pie
that
he
had
bought
of
flake
at
the
little
black
at
the
corner
on
these
occasions
he
always
stepped
aside
and
with
a
deferential
bow
waited
for
ruth
to
pass
he
was
a
thin
spare
man
slightly
bent
his
hair
and
whiskers
curiously
striped
like
a
zebra
one
lock
being
jet
black
while
the
neighboring
one
was
as
distinct
a
white
his
dress
was
plain
but
very
neat
and
tidy
he
never
seemed
to
have
any
business
as
he
stayed
in
his
room
all
day
never
leaving
it
at
all
till
dark
when
he
paced
up
and
down
with
his
hands
behind
him
before
the
house
whir
whir
whir
it
was
early
sunrise
but
ruth
had
heard
that
odd
noise
for
two
hours
at
least
what
it
mean
just
then
a
carrier
passed
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
with
the
morning
papers
and
slipped
one
under
the
crack
of
the
house
door
opposite
a
thought
why
could
not
ruth
write
for
the
papers
how
very
odd
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
before
yes
write
for
the
papers
why
not
she
remembered
that
while
at
an
editor
of
a
paper
in
the
same
town
used
often
to
come
in
and
take
down
her
compositions
in
as
she
read
them
aloud
and
transfer
them
to
the
columns
of
his
paper
she
certainly
to
write
better
now
than
she
did
when
an
inexperienced
girl
she
would
begin
that
very
night
but
where
to
make
a
beginning
who
would
publish
her
articles
how
much
would
they
pay
her
to
whom
should
she
apply
first
there
was
her
brother
hyacinth
now
the
prosperous
editor
of
the
irving
magazine
oh
if
he
would
only
employ
her
ruth
was
quite
sure
she
could
write
as
well
as
some
of
his
correspondents
whom
he
had
praised
with
no
niggardly
pen
she
would
prepare
samples
to
send
immediately
announcing
her
intention
and
offering
them
for
his
acceptance
this
means
of
support
would
be
so
congenial
so
absorbing
at
the
needle
one
mind
could
still
be
brooding
over
sorrowful
thoughts
ruth
counted
the
days
and
hours
impatiently
as
she
waited
for
an
answer
hyacinth
surely
would
not
refuse
when
in
almost
every
number
of
his
magazine
he
was
announcing
some
new
contributor
or
if
could
not
employ
her
he
surely
would
be
brotherly
enough
to
point
out
to
her
some
one
of
the
many
avenues
so
accessible
to
a
man
of
extensive
newspaperial
and
literary
acquaintance
she
would
so
gladly
support
herself
so
cheerfully
toil
day
and
night
if
need
be
could
she
only
win
an
independence
and
ruth
recalled
with
a
sigh
katy
last
visit
to
her
father
and
then
she
rose
and
walked
the
floor
in
her
impatience
and
then
her
restless
spirit
urging
her
on
to
her
fate
she
went
again
to
the
post
office
to
see
if
there
were
no
letter
how
long
the
clerk
made
her
wait
yes
there
a
letter
for
her
and
in
her
brother
too
oh
how
long
since
she
had
seen
it
ruth
heeded
neither
the
jostling
of
porters
or
draymen
as
she
held
out
her
eager
hand
for
the
letter
thrusting
it
hastily
in
her
pocket
she
hurried
in
breathless
haste
back
to
her
lodgings
the
contents
were
as
follows
i
have
looked
over
the
pieces
you
sent
me
ruth
it
is
very
evident
that
writing
never
can
be
forte
you
have
no
talent
that
way
you
may
possibly
be
employed
by
some
inferior
newspapers
but
be
assured
your
articles
never
will
be
heard
of
out
of
your
own
little
provincial
city
for
myself
i
have
plenty
of
contributors
nor
do
i
know
of
any
of
my
literary
acquaintances
who
would
employ
you
i
would
advise
you
therefore
to
seek
some
employment
your
brother
hyacinth
ellet
a
bitter
smile
struggled
with
the
hot
tear
that
fell
upon
ruth
cheek
i
have
tried
the
unobtrusive
employment
said
ruth
the
wages
are
six
cents
a
day
hyacinth
and
again
the
bitter
smile
disfigured
her
gentle
lip
no
talent
at
another
tribunal
than
his
will
i
appeal
never
be
heard
of
out
of
my
own
little
provincial
city
the
cold
contemptuous
tone
stung
her
but
they
shall
be
heard
of
and
ruth
leaped
to
her
feet
sooner
than
he
dreams
of
too
i
do
it
i
it
i
do
it
and
she
closed
her
lips
firmly
but
there
will
be
a
desperate
struggle
first
and
she
clasped
her
hands
over
her
heart
as
if
it
had
already
commenced
there
will
be
scant
meals
and
sleepless
nights
and
weary
days
and
a
throbbing
brow
and
an
aching
heart
there
will
be
the
chilling
tone
the
rude
repulse
there
will
be
ten
backward
steps
to
one
forward
must
sleep
but
and
ruth
glanced
at
her
children
it
shall
be
they
shall
be
proud
of
their
mother
shall
yet
be
proud
to
claim
his
what
is
it
mamma
asked
katy
looking
wonderingly
at
the
strange
expression
of
her
mother
face
what
is
it
my
darling
and
ruth
caught
up
the
child
with
convulsive
energy
what
is
it
only
that
when
you
are
a
woman
you
shall
remember
this
day
my
little
pet
and
as
she
kissed
katy
upturned
brow
a
bright
spot
burned
on
her
cheek
and
her
eye
glowed
like
a
star
chapter
lvii
doctor
said
hall
put
down
that
book
will
you
i
want
to
talk
to
you
a
bit
there
you
sat
these
three
hours
without
stirring
except
to
brush
the
flies
off
your
nose
and
my
tongue
actually
aches
keeping
still
said
the
doctor
running
his
forefinger
along
to
guide
his
purblind
eyes
safely
to
the
end
of
the
paragraph
is
by
captain
smith
that
there
are
of
ten
hundred
human
critters
in
the
well
mis
hall
well
said
the
doctor
laying
a
faded
ribbon
mark
between
the
leaves
of
the
book
and
pushing
his
spectacles
back
on
his
forehead
what
to
pay
now
what
do
you
want
of
me
i
a
great
mind
as
ever
i
had
to
eat
said
the
old
lady
pettishly
to
knit
twice
round
the
heel
of
this
stocking
before
i
answer
you
what
do
you
think
i
care
about
captain
smith
travelers
always
lie
it
is
a
part
of
their
trade
and
if
they
do
it
neither
here
nor
there
to
me
i
wish
that
book
was
in
the
red
sea
i
thought
you
did
want
it
retorted
the
irritating
old
doctor
now
i
suppose
you
call
that
funny
said
the
old
lady
i
call
it
simply
ridiculous
for
a
man
of
your
years
to
play
on
words
in
such
a
frivolous
manner
what
i
was
going
to
say
was
this
if
i
can
get
a
chance
to
say
it
if
have
given
up
all
idea
of
getting
children
have
and
now
is
the
time
to
apply
for
katy
again
for
according
to
all
accounts
ruth
is
getting
along
poorly
enough
how
did
you
hear
asked
the
doctor
why
my
milliner
miss
tiffkins
has
a
nephew
who
tends
in
a
little
near
where
ruth
boards
and
he
says
that
she
buys
a
smaller
loaf
every
time
she
comes
to
the
store
and
that
the
milkman
told
him
that
she
only
took
a
pint
of
milk
a
day
of
him
now
then
katy
has
not
been
well
and
what
she
did
for
doctors
and
medicines
is
best
known
to
herself
she
so
independent
that
she
never
would
complain
if
she
had
to
eat
paving
stones
the
best
way
to
get
the
child
will
be
to
ask
her
here
on
a
visit
and
say
we
want
to
cure
her
up
a
little
with
country
air
you
understand
that
will
throw
dust
in
ruth
eyes
and
then
we
will
take
our
own
time
about
letting
her
go
back
you
know
miss
tiffkins
says
her
nephew
says
that
people
who
come
into
the
are
very
curious
to
know
who
ruth
is
and
old
flake
who
keeps
it
says
that
it
would
hurt
her
any
if
she
is
a
lady
to
stop
and
talk
a
little
like
the
rest
of
his
customers
he
says
too
that
her
children
are
as
as
their
mother
for
when
he
just
asked
katy
what
business
her
father
used
to
do
and
what
supported
them
now
he
was
dead
and
if
they
lived
all
the
time
on
bread
and
milk
and
a
few
such
little
questions
katy
answered
does
not
allow
me
to
talk
to
strangers
and
went
out
of
the
shop
with
her
loaf
of
bread
as
dignified
as
a
little
duchess
like
mother
like
child
said
the
doctor
proud
and
poor
proud
and
poor
that
tells
the
whole
story
well
shall
i
write
to
ruth
mis
hall
about
katy
no
said
the
old
lady
let
me
manage
that
you
will
upset
the
whole
business
if
you
do
i
a
plan
in
my
head
and
after
breakfast
i
take
the
old
chaise
and
go
in
after
katy
in
pursuance
of
this
plan
the
old
lady
on
the
following
day
climbed
up
into
an
chaise
and
turned
the
steady
old
horse
nose
in
the
direction
of
the
city
jerking
at
the
reins
and
clucking
and
him
up
after
the
usual
awkward
fashion
of
sexegenarian
female
drivers
using
miss
tiffkin
the
little
black
for
a
she
soon
discovered
ruth
abode
and
so
well
did
she
play
her
part
in
commiserating
ruth
misfortunes
and
katy
sickly
appearance
that
the
widow
kind
heart
was
immediately
tortured
with
the
most
unnecessary
which
prepared
the
way
for
an
acceptance
of
her
invitation
for
katy
for
a
week
or
two
great
promises
meanwhile
being
held
out
to
the
child
of
a
little
pony
to
ride
and
various
other
tempting
lures
of
the
same
kind
still
little
katy
hesitated
clinging
tightly
to
her
mother
dress
and
looking
with
her
clear
searching
eyes
into
her
grandmother
face
in
a
way
that
would
have
embarrassed
a
less
artful
manoeuverer
the
old
lady
understood
the
glance
and
put
it
on
file
to
be
attended
to
at
her
leisure
it
being
no
part
of
her
present
errand
to
play
the
unamiable
little
katy
finally
won
over
consented
to
make
the
visit
and
the
old
chaise
was
again
set
in
motion
for
home

how
d
do
ruth
asked
ellet
the
next
morning
as
he
ran
against
ruth
in
the
street
glad
you
have
taken
my
advice
and
done
a
sensible
thing
at
last
i
do
know
what
you
mean
answered
ruth
why
the
doctor
told
me
yesterday
that
you
had
given
katy
up
to
them
to
bring
up
you
would
have
done
better
if
you
had
sent
off
nettie
too
i
have
not
katy
up
said
ruth
starting
and
blushing
deeply
and
they
could
not
have
understood
it
so
she
has
only
gone
on
a
visit
of
a
fortnight
to
recruit
a
little
pooh
pooh
replied
ellet
the
thing
is
quietly
over
with
now
do
make
a
fuss
the
old
folks
expect
to
keep
her
they
wrote
to
me
about
it
and
i
approved
of
it
it
the
best
thing
all
round
and
as
i
just
said
it
would
have
been
better
still
if
nettie
had
gone
too
now
do
make
a
fool
of
yourself
you
can
go
once
in
awhile
i
suppose
to
see
the
child
can
i
go
asked
ruth
looking
her
father
calmly
in
the
face
it
costs
fifty
cents
every
trip
by
railroad
and
you
know
i
have
not
the
money
that
for
you
to
decide
answered
the
father
coldly
i
ca
be
bothered
about
such
trifles
it
is
the
way
you
always
do
ruth
whenever
i
see
you
but
it
is
time
i
was
at
my
office
do
make
a
fool
of
yourself
now
mind
what
i
tell
you
and
let
well
alone
father
said
ruth
father
ca
stop
ca
stop
said
ellet
moving
rapidly
down
street
to
get
out
of
his
daughter
way
can
it
be
possible
thought
ruth
looking
after
him
that
he
could
connive
at
such
duplicity
was
the
old
lady
sympathy
a
mere
stratagem
to
work
upon
my
feelings
how
unnecessarily
i
reproached
myself
with
my
supposed
injustice
to
her
can
people
do
such
things
is
religion
only
a
fable
no
no
god
be
true
and
every
man
a
liar
chapter
lix
is
this
daily
type
office
asked
ruth
of
a
printer
boy
who
was
rushing
down
five
steps
at
a
time
with
an
empty
pail
in
his
hand
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
ask
mem
you
got
a
tongue
in
your
head
have
ye
women
folks
generally
has
said
the
little
ruffian
ruth
obeying
this
civil
invitation
knocked
gently
at
the
office
door
a
whir
of
machinery
and
a
bad
odor
of
damp
paper
and
cigar
smoke
issued
through
the
crack
i
shall
have
to
walk
in
said
ruth
they
never
will
hear
my
feeble
knock
amid
all
this
racket
and
bustle
and
pushing
the
door
ajar
she
found
herself
in
the
midst
of
a
group
of
smokers
who
in
slippered
feet
and
with
heels
higher
than
their
heads
were
whiffing
and
laughing
amid
the
pauses
of
conversation
most
uproariously
face
crimsoned
as
heels
and
cigars
remained
in
and
her
glance
was
met
by
a
rude
stare
i
called
to
see
if
you
would
like
a
new
contributor
to
your
paper
said
ruth
if
so
i
will
leave
a
few
samples
of
my
articles
for
your
inspection
what
do
you
say
bill
said
the
person
addressed
drawer
full
as
usual
i
suppose
is
it
more
chaff
than
wheat
too
i
swear
do
want
any
come
now
jo
let
hear
the
rest
of
that
story
shut
the
door
if
you
please
are
you
the
editor
of
the
guide
said
ruth
to
a
thin
gentleman
in
a
white
and
green
spectacles
whose
editorial
sanctum
was
not
far
from
the
office
she
had
just
left
i
am
do
you
employ
contributors
for
your
paper
sometimes
shall
i
leave
you
this
for
your
inspection
sir
just
as
you
please
have
you
a
copy
of
your
paper
here
sir
from
which
i
could
judge
what
style
of
articles
you
prefer
at
this
the
gentleman
addressed
raised
his
eyes
for
the
first
time
wheeled
his
editorial
round
facing
ruth
and
peering
over
his
green
spectacles
remarked
our
paper
madam
is
most
a
paper
devoted
to
the
interests
of
religion
no
frivolous
jests
no
ditties
no
fashionable
sentimentalism
finds
a
place
in
its
columns
this
is
a
serious
world
madam
and
it
ill
becomes
those
who
are
born
to
die
to
go
dancing
through
it
josephus
remarks
that
the
saviour
of
the
world
was
never
known
to
smile
seldom
smile
are
you
a
religious
woman
madam
i
endeavor
to
become
so
answered
ruth
good
what
sect
presbyterian
at
this
the
white
gentleman
moved
back
his
chair
wrong
madam
all
wrong
i
was
educated
by
the
best
of
fathers
but
he
was
a
presbyterian
his
son
is
not
a
presbyterian
his
son
paper
sets
its
face
like
a
flint
against
that
heresy
no
madam
we
shall
have
no
occasion
for
your
contributions
a
hope
built
on
a
presbyterian
foundation
is
built
on
the
sand
good
morning
madam
did
ruth
despair
no
but
the
weary
little
feet
which
for
so
many
hours
had
kept
pace
with
hers
needed
a
reprieve
little
nettie
must
go
home
and
ruth
must
read
the
office
signs
as
she
went
along
to
prepare
for
new
attempts
on
the
morrow
would
a
brighter
morrow
come
ruth
thought
of
her
children
and
said
again
with
a
strong
heart
and
taking
little
netty
upon
her
lap
she
divided
with
her
their
frugal
supper
a
scanty
bowl
of
bread
and
milk
ruth
could
not
but
acknowledge
to
herself
that
she
had
thus
far
met
with
but
poor
encouragement
but
she
knew
that
to
climb
she
must
begin
at
the
lowest
round
of
the
ladder
it
were
useless
to
apply
to
a
leading
paper
for
employment
unless
endorsed
by
some
influential
name
her
brother
had
coolly
almost
contemptuously
set
her
aside
and
yet
in
the
very
last
number
of
his
magazine
which
accident
threw
in
her
way
he
pleaded
for
public
favor
for
a
young
actress
whom
he
said
had
been
driven
by
fortune
from
the
sheltered
privacy
of
home
to
earn
her
subsistence
upon
the
stage
and
whose
earnest
nature
he
thought
should
meet
with
a
better
welcome
than
mere
curiosity
oh
why
not
one
word
for
me
thought
ruth
and
how
can
i
ask
of
strangers
a
favor
which
a
brother
heart
has
so
coldly
refused
it
was
very
disagreeable
applying
to
the
small
papers
many
of
the
editors
of
which
accustomed
to
dealing
with
hoydenish
contributors
were
incapable
of
comprehending
that
their
manner
towards
ruth
had
been
marked
by
any
want
of
that
respectful
courtesy
due
to
a
dignified
woman
from
all
such
contact
ruth
shrank
sensitively
their
tone
fell
upon
her
ear
so
painfully
as
often
to
bring
the
tears
to
her
eyes
oh
if
harry
but
she
must
not
think
of
him
the
next
day
ruth
wandered
about
the
business
streets
looking
into
reading
signs
and
trying
to
gather
from
their
hieroglyphics
some
light
to
illumine
her
darkened
pathway
day
after
day
chronicled
only
repeated
failures
and
now
notwithstanding
she
had
reduced
their
already
meagre
fare
her
purse
was
nearly
empty
chapter
lx
it
was
a
warm
sultry
sabbath
morning
not
a
breath
of
air
played
over
the
heated
roofs
of
the
great
swarming
city
ruth
sat
in
her
little
close
attic
leaning
her
head
upon
her
hand
weary
languid
and
dejected
life
seemed
to
her
scarce
worth
the
pains
to
keep
its
little
flame
flickering
a
dull
pain
was
in
her
temples
a
heavy
weight
upon
her
heart
other
sabbaths
sabbaths
came
up
to
her
remembrance
earth
looked
so
dark
to
her
now
heaven
so
distant

so
inscrutable
hark
to
the
ruth
took
little
nettie
by
the
hand
and
led
her
slowly
to
church
other
families
families
passed
her
on
their
way
families
whose
sunny
thresholds
the
destroying
angel
had
never
crossed
oh
why
the
joy
to
them
the
pain
to
her
sadly
she
entered
the

and
took
her
accustomed
seat
amid
the
worshippers
the

opened
the

and

upon
ruth
troubled

these

words
there
remaineth
therefore
a
rest
for
the
people

the

the
joy
of

mysterious
crooked
unfathomable

the

suffered
all
for

ruth
weeps
weeps
that
her
faith
was
for
an
instant
weeps
that
she
shrank
from
breasting
the
foaming
waves
at
the
bidding
of
him
who
said
it
is
i
be
not
afraid
and
she
who
came
there
fluttering
with
a
broken
wing
went
away
singing
soaring
oh
man

down
with
many

anxious
and
troubled

not

fearing

lxi
fine
day
ellet
said
a
country
clergyman
to
ruth
father
as
he
sat
comfortably
ensconced
in
his
i
do
see
but
you
look
as
young
as
you
did
when
i
saw
you
five
years
ago
life
has
gone
smoothly
with
you
you
have
been
remarkably
prospered
in
business
mr
ellet
yes
yes
said
the
old
gentleman
who
was
inordinately
fond
of
talking
of
himself
yes
yes
i
may
say
that
though
i
came
into
massachusetts
with
a
loaf
of
bread
and
a
sixpence
and
now
well
not
to
boast
i
own
this
house
and
the
land
attached
beside
my
and
have
a
nice
little
sum
stowed
away
in
the
bank
for
a
rainy
day
yes
providence
has
smiled
on
my
enterprise
my
affairs
are
as
you
say
in
a
prosperous
condition
i
hope
religion
flourishes
in
your
church
brother
clark
dead
dead
dead
as
the
valley
of
dry
bones
replied
clark
with
a
groan
i
have
been
trying
to
up
a
revival
but
satan
reigns
satan
reigns
and
the
right
arm
of
the
church
seems
paralysed
sometimes
i
think
the
is
the
avaricious
and
spirit
of
its
professors
very
likely
answered
ellet
there
is
a
great
deal
too
much
of
that
in
the
church
i
alluded
to
it
myself
in
my
remarks
at
the
last
i
called
it
the
accursed
thing
the
achan
in
the
camp
the
jonah
which
was
to
hazard
the
lord
bethel
and
i
humbly
hope
my
remarks
were
blessed
i
understand
from
the
last
monthly
concert
brother
clark
that
there
are
good
accounts
from
the
sandwich
islands
twenty
heathen
admitted
to
the
church
in
one
day
good
news
that
yes
groaned
brother
clark
to
whose
blurred
vision
the
sun
of
righteousness
was
always
clouded
yes
but
think
how
many
more
are
still
and
always
will
be
worshipping
idols
think
how
long
it
takes
a
missionary
to
acquire
a
knowledge
of
the
language
and
think
how
many
just
as
they
become
perfected
in
it
die
of
the
climate
or
are
killed
by
the
natives
leaving
their
helpless
young
families
to
burden
the
board
very
sad
brother
ellet
sometimes
when
i
think
of
all
this
outlay
of
money
and
human
lives
and
so
little
accomplished
i
here
a
succession
of
protracted
sneezes
prevented
clark
from
finishing
the
sentence
yes
replied
ellet
coming
to
the
rescue
but
if
only
heathen
had
been
saved
there
would
be
joy
forever
in
heaven
he
who
saveth
a
soul
from
death
you
know
hideth
a
multitude
of
sins
i
think
i
spoke
a
word
in
season
the
other
day
which
has
resulted
in
one
admission
at
least
to
our
church
it
is
to
be
hoped
the
new
member
will
prove
steadfast
said
the
but
hypochondriac
brother
clark
with
another
groan
many
a
hopeful
convert
goes
back
to
the
world
and
the
last
state
of
that
soul
is
worse
than
the
first
dreadful
dreadful
i
am
heartsick
brother
ellet
come
said
ruth
father
tapping
him
on
the
shoulder
dinner
is
ready
will
you
sit
down
with
us
first
salmon
of
the
season
green
peas
boiled
fowl
oysters
your
country
parishioners
do
feed
you
that
way
i
suppose
n
o
said
brother
clark
no
there
is
no
verse
in
the
whole
bible
truer
or
more
dishonored
in
the
observance
than
this
laborer
is
worthy
of
his
hire
i
stay
to
dinner
brother
ellet
you
have
i
bless
god
a
warm
heart
and
a
liberal
one
your
praise
is
in
all
the
churches
a
self
satisfied
smile
played
round
the
lips
of
ruth
father
at
this
tribute
to
his
superior
sanctity
and
seating
himself
at
the
table
he
uttered
an
unusually
lengthy
grace
some
more
supper
please
mamma
vainly
pleaded
little
nettie
chapter
lxii
ruth
had
found
employment
ruth
mss
had
been
accepted
at
the
office
of
the
standard
yes
an
article
of
hers
was
to
be
published
in
the
very
next
issue
the
remuneration
was
not
what
ruth
had
hoped
but
it
was
at
least
a
a
what
a
pity
that
lescom
the
editor
rule
was
not
to
pay
a
contributor
even
after
a
piece
was
accepted
until
it
was
printed
and
ruth
so
short
of
funds
could
she
hold
out
to
work
so
hard
and
fare
so
rigidly
for
often
there
was
only
a
crust
left
at
night
but
god
be
thanked
she
should
now
that
crust
it
was
a
pity
that
oil
was
so
dear
too
because
most
of
her
writing
must
be
done
at
night
when
nettie
little
prattling
voice
was
hushed
and
her
innumerable
little
wants
forgotten
in
sleep
yes
it
a
pity
that
good
oil
was
so
dear
for
the
cheaper
kind
crusted
so
soon
on
the
wick
and
ruth
eyes
from
excessive
weeping
had
become
quite
tender
and
often
very
painful
then
it
would
be
so
mortifying
should
a
mistake
occur
in
one
of
her
articles
she
must
write
very
legibly
for
were
sometimes
sad
bunglers
making
people
accountable
for
words
that
would
set
worcester
or
hair
on
end
but
poor
things
worked
hard
too
they
had
sorrows
thinking
long
into
the
still
night
as
they
scattered
the
types
more
of
their
dependent
wives
and
children
than
of
the
orthography
of
a
word
or
the
rhetoric
of
a
sentence
scratch
scratch
scratch
went
ruth
pen
the
dim
lamp
flickering
in
the
night
breeze
while
the
deep
breathing
of
the
little
sleepers
was
the
watchword
to
her
throbbing
brow
and
weary
fingers
one
two
three
the
lamp
burns
low
in
the
socket
ruth
lays
down
her
pen
and
pushing
back
the
hair
from
her
forehead
leans
faint
and
exhausted
against
the
that
the
cool
may
fan
her
heated
temples
how
impressive
the
stillness
ruth
can
almost
hear
her
own
heart
beat
she
looks
upward
and
the
watchful
stars
seem
to
her
like
the
eyes
of
gentle
friends
no
god
would
forsake
her
a
sweet
peace
steals
into
her
troubled
heart
and
the
overtasked
lids
droop
heavily
over
the
weary
eyes
ruth
sleeps
daylight
morning
soon
all
night
ruth
has
leaned
with
her
head
on
the
and
now
she
wakes
unrefreshed
from
the
constrained
posture
but
she
has
no
time
to
heed
for
little
nettie
lies
moaning
in
her
bed
with
pain
she
lifts
the
little
creature
in
her
lap
rocks
her
gently
and
kisses
her
cheek
but
still
little
nettie
moans
ruth
goes
to
the
drawer
and
looks
in
her
small
purse
harry
gift
it
is
empty
then
she
clasps
her
hands
and
looks
again
at
little
nettie
must
nettie
die
for
want
of
care
oh
if
lescom
would
advance
her
the
money
for
the
contributions
he
had
accepted
but
he
said
so
decidedly
that
it
was
a
rule
he
departed
from
and
there
were
yet
five
long
days
before
the
next
paper
would
be
out
five
days
what
might
not
happen
to
nettie
in
five
days
there
was
her
cousin
millet
but
she
had
muffled
her
furniture
in
linen
wrappers
and
gone
to
the
springs
with
her
family
for
the
summer
months
there
was
her
father
but
had
he
not
said
remember
if
you
burden
yourself
with
your
children
you
must
not
look
to
me
for
help
kissing
little
nettie
cheek
she
lays
her
gently
on
the
bed
whispering
in
a
husky
voice
only
a
few
moments
nettie
mamma
will
be
back
soon
she
closes
the
door
upon
the
sick
child
and
stands
with
her
hand
upon
her
bewildered
brow
thinking
i
beg
your
pardon
madam
the
entry
is
so
very
dark
i
did
not
see
you
said
mr
bond
you
are
as
early
a
riser
as
myself
my
child
is
sick
answered
ruth
tremulously
i
was
just
going
out
for
medicine
if
you
approve
of
homoeopathy
said
mr
bond
and
will
trust
me
to
prescribe
there
will
be
no
necessity
for
your
putting
yourself
to
that
trouble
i
always
treat
myself
homoeopathically
in
sickness
and
happen
to
have
a
small
supply
of
those
medicines
by
me
ruth
natural
independence
revolted
at
the
idea
of
receiving
a
favor
from
a
stranger
perhaps
you
disapprove
of
homoeopathy
said
mr
bond
mistaking
the
cause
of
her
momentary
hesitation
it
works
like
a
charm
with
children
but
if
you
prefer
not
to
try
it
allow
me
to
go
out
and
procure
you
whatever
you
desire
in
the
way
of
medicine
you
will
not
then
be
obliged
to
leave
your
child
here
was
another
dilemma
what
ruth
do
why
clearly
accept
his
first
offer
there
was
an
air
of
goodness
and
sincerity
about
him
which
added
to
his
years
seemed
to
invite
her
confidence
mr
bond
stepped
in
looked
at
nettie
and
felt
her
pulse
ah
little
one
we
will
soon
have
you
better
said
he
as
he
left
the
room
to
obtain
his
little
package
of
medicines
thank
you
said
ruth
with
a
grateful
smile
as
he
administered
to
nettie
some
infinitesimal
pills
not
in
the
least
said
mr
bond
i
learned
two
years
since
to
doctor
myself
in
this
way
and
i
have
often
had
the
pleasure
of
relieving
others
in
emergencies
like
this
from
my
little
homoeopathic
stores
you
will
find
that
your
little
girl
will
soon
fall
into
a
sweet
sleep
and
awake
much
relieved
if
you
are
careful
with
her
she
will
i
think
need
nothing
more
in
the
way
of
medicine
or
if
she
should
my
advice
is
quite
at
your
service
and
taking
his
pitcher
of
water
in
his
hand
he
bowed
respectfully
and
wished
ruth
good
morning
who
was
he
what
was
he
whir
whir
there
was
the
noise
again
that
he
was
a
man
of
refined
and
courteous
manners
was
very
certain
ruth
felt
glad
he
was
so
much
her
senior
he
seemed
so
like
what
ruth
had
sometimes
dreamed
a
kind
father
might
be
that
it
lessened
the
weight
of
the
obligation
already
little
nettie
had
ceased
moaning
her
little
lids
began
to
droop
and
her
skin
which
had
been
hot
and
feverish
became
moist
and
cool
may
god
reward
him
whoever
he
may
be
said
ruth
surely
it
blessed
to
chapter
lxiii
it
was
four
of
a
hot
august
afternoon
the
sun
had
crept
round
to
the
front
piazza
of
the
doctor
cottage
no
friendly
trees
warded
off
his
burning
rays
for
the
doctor
liked
a
prospect
he
liked
to
sit
at
the
window
and
count
the
different
trains
which
whizzed
past
in
the
course
of
the
day
the
number
of
wagons
and
gigs
and
carriages
that
rolled
lazily
up
the
hill
to
see
the
village
engine
the
cataract
drawn
out
on
the
green
for
its
weekly
ablutions
and
to
count
the
bundles
of
shingles
that
it
took
to
roof
over
squire
new
barn
no
drooping
vines
therefore
or
creepers
intruded
between
him
and
this
pleasant
prospect
the
doctor
was
an
utilitarian
he
could
see
no
use
in
such
things
save
to
rot
timber
and
harbor
vermin
so
a
wondrous
glare
of
white
paint
carefully
renewed
every
spring
blinded
the
traveler
whose
misfortune
it
was
to
pass
the
road
by
the
doctor
house
as
i
said
it
was
now
four
the
twelve
dinner
was
long
since
over
the
irish
girl
had
rinsed
out
her
hung
them
out
the
back
door
to
dry
and
gone
down
to
the
village
store
to
buy
some
new
ribbons
advertised
as
selling
at
an
immense
sacrifice
by
the
disinterested
village
shopkeeper
let
us
peep
into
the
doctor
sitting
room
the
air
of
this
room
is
close
and
stifled
for
the
windows
must
be
tightly
closed
lest
some
audacious
fly
should
make
his
mark
on
the
old
lady
immaculate
walls
a
centre
table
stands
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
with
a
copy
of
the
religious
pilot
last
year
almanac
a
directory
and
the
remarkable
escape
of
eliza
cook
who
was
partially
scalped
by
the
indians
on
one
side
of
the
room
hangs
a
piece
of
framed
by
the
virgin
fingers
of
the
old
lady
representing
an
unhappy
female
weeping
over
a
very
high
and
very
perpendicular
tombstone
which
is
hieroglyphiced
over
with
untranslateable
characters
in
red
worsted
while
a
few
herbs
not
mentioned
by
botanists
are
struggling
for
existence
at
its
base
a
friendly
of
a
most
extraordinary
shade
of
blue
green
droops
in
sympathy
over
the
afflicted
female
while
a
nondescript
looking
bird
resembling
a
dropsical
suspends
his
song
and
one
leg
in
the
foreground
it
was
principally
to
preserve
this
of
art
that
the
windows
were
hermetically
sealed
to
the
entrance
of
vagrant
flies
the
old
doctor
with
his
spectacles
awry
and
his
hands
drooping
listlessly
at
his
side
snored
from
the
depths
of
his
while
opposite
him
the
old
lady
peering
out
from
behind
a
very
cap
border
was
seaming
widening
and
narrowing
with
a
precision
and
perseverance
most
painful
to
witness
outside
the
bee
hummed
the
robin
twittered
the
shining
leaves
of
the
village
trees
danced
and
whispered
to
the
shifting
clouds
the
free
glad
breeze
swept
the
tall
and
the
village
children
as
free
and
fetterless
danced
and
shouted
at
their
sports
but
there
sat
little
katy
with
her
hands
crossed
in
her
lap
as
she
sat
for
many
an
hour
listening
to
the
click
of
her
grandmother
needles
and
the
sonorous
breathings
of
the
doctor
rubicund
nose
sometimes
she
moved
uneasily
in
her
chair
but
the
old
lady
uplifted
finger
would
immediately
remind
her
that
little
girls
must
be
seen
and
not
heard
it
was
a
great
thing
for
katy
when
a
mouse
scratched
on
the
wainscot
or
her
grandmother
ball
rolled
out
of
her
lap
giving
her
a
chance
to
stretch
her
little
cramped
limbs
and
now
the
village
bell
began
to
toll
with
a
low
booming
funereal
sound
sending
a
cold
shudder
through
the
child
nervous
and
excited
frame
what
if
mother
should
die
way
off
in
the
city
what
if
she
should
live
in
this
terrible
way
at
her
grandmother
with
nobody
to
love
her
or
kiss
her
or
pat
her
little
head
kindly
and
say
katy
dear
and
again
the
bell
boomed
out
its
mournful
sound
and
little
katy
unable
longer
to
bear
the
torturing
thoughts
it
called
up
sobbed
aloud
it
was
all
in
vain
that
the
frowning
old
lady
held
up
her
warning
finger
the
were
opened
and
katy
could
not
have
stopped
her
tears
had
her
life
depended
on
it
hark
a
knock
at
the
door
a
strange
footstep
mother
shrieked
the
child
hysterically
mother
and
flew
into
ruth
sheltering
arms
what
we
do
doctor
asked
the
old
lady
the
day
after
visit
i
trusted
to
her
not
being
able
to
get
the
money
to
come
out
here
and
her
father
i
knew
would
give
it
to
her
and
now
here
she
has
walked
the
whole
distance
with
nettie
in
her
arms
except
a
lift
a
wagoner
or
two
gave
her
on
the
road
and
i
verily
believe
she
would
have
done
it
had
it
been
twice
the
distance
it
is
i
never
shall
be
able
to
bring
up
that
child
according
to
my
notions
while
is
round
forbid
her
the
house
she
deserves
it
only
that
it
wo
sound
well
if
she
tells
of
it
and
to
think
of
that
ungrateful
little
flying
into
her
mother
arms
as
if
she
was
in
the
last
extremity
after
all
we
have
done
for
her
i
do
suppose
ruth
would
have
left
her
with
us
as
it
is
if
she
had
the
bread
to
put
in
her
mouth
she
might
as
well
give
her
up
though
first
as
last
for
she
never
will
be
able
to
support
her
she
fit
for
nothing
but
a
parlor
ornament
said
the
doctor
never
was
no
more
business
talent
in
ruth
ellet
than
there
is
in
that
chany
image
of
yours
on
the
mis
hall
that
tells
the
whole
story
chapter
lxiv
i
have
good
news
for
you
said
lescom
to
ruth
at
her
next
weekly
visit
your
very
first
articles
are
copied
i
see
into
many
of
my
exchanges
even
into
the
which
seldom
contains
anything
but
politics
a
good
sign
for
you
hall
a
good
test
of
your
popularity
ruth
eyes
sparkled
and
her
whole
face
glowed
ladies
to
be
praised
said
lescom
with
a
mischievous
smile
oh
it
is
not
that
not
that
sir
said
ruth
with
a
sudden
moistening
of
the
eye
it
is
because
it
will
be
bread
for
my
children
lescom
checked
his
mirthful
mood
and
said
well
here
is
something
good
for
me
too
a
letter
from
missouri
in
which
the
writer
says
that
if
floy
a
pretty
that
of
yours
hall
is
to
be
a
contributor
for
the
coming
year
i
may
put
him
down
as
a
subscriber
as
well
as
jones
may
and
noyes
all
of
the
same
place
good
news
for
you
see
said
lescom
with
one
of
his
pleasant
beaming
smiles
yes
replied
ruth
abstractedly
she
was
wondering
if
her
articles
were
to
be
the
means
of
swelling
lescom
subscription
list
whether
ought
not
to
profit
by
it
as
well
as
himself
and
whether
she
should
not
ask
him
to
increase
her
pay
she
pulled
her
gloves
off
and
on
and
finally
mustered
courage
to
clothe
her
thought
in
words
now
that
just
a
woman
replied
lescom
turning
it
off
with
a
joke
give
them
the
least
and
they
will
want
the
whole
territory
had
i
not
shown
you
that
letter
you
would
have
been
quite
contented
with
your
present
pay
ah
i
see
it
wo
do
to
talk
so
unprofessionally
to
you
and
you
need
expect
said
he
smiling
that
i
shall
ever
speak
of
letters
containing
new
subscribers
on
your
account
i
could
easily
get
you
the
offer
of
a
handsome
salary
by
publishing
such
things
no
no
i
have
been
foolish
enough
to
lose
two
or
three
valuable
contributors
in
that
way
i
have
learned
better
than
that
and
taking
out
his
purse
he
paid
ruth
the
usual
sum
for
her
articles
ruth
bowed
courteously
and
put
the
money
in
her
purse
but
she
sighed
as
she
went
down
the
office
stairs
lescom
view
of
the
case
was
a
business
one
undoubtedly
and
the
same
view
that
almost
any
other
business
man
would
have
taken
viz
to
retain
her
at
her
present
low
rate
of
compensation
till
he
was
necessitated
to
raise
it
by
a
higher
bid
from
a
rival
quarter
and
so
she
must
plod
wearily
on
till
that
time
came
and
poor
katy
must
still
be
an
exile
for
she
had
not
enough
to
feed
her
her
landlady
having
raised
the
rent
of
her
room
two
shillings
and
ruth
being
unable
to
find
cheaper
accommodations
it
hard
but
what
could
be
done
ruth
believed
she
had
exhausted
all
the
offices
she
knew
of
oh
there
was
one
the
pilgrim
she
had
not
tried
there
she
would
call
at
the
office
on
her
way
home
the
editor
of
the
pilgrim
talked
largely
he
had
now
plenty
of
contributors
he
did
know
about
employing
a
new
one
had
she
ever
written
and
had
she
written
ruth
showed
him
her
article
in
the
last
number
of
the
standard
oh
hum
hum
said
tibbetts
changing
his
tone
so
you
are
are
you
casting
his
eyes
on
her
what
pay
do
they
give
you
over
there
ruth
was
a
novice
in
but
she
had
strong
common
sense
and
that
common
sense
said
he
has
no
right
to
ask
you
that
question
do
you
tell
him
so
she
replied
with
dignity
my
bargain
sir
with
lescom
was
a
private
one
i
believe
hum
said
the
foiled
tibbetts
adding
in
an
to
his
partner
sharp
that
well
if
i
conclude
to
engage
you
said
tibbetts
i
should
prefer
you
would
write
for
me
over
a
different
signature
than
the
one
by
which
your
pieces
are
indicated
at
the
standard
office
or
you
can
write
exclusively
for
my
paper
with
regard
to
your
first
proposal
said
ruth
if
i
have
gained
any
reputation
by
my
first
efforts
it
appears
to
me
that
i
should
be
foolish
to
throw
it
away
by
the
adoption
of
another
signature
and
with
regard
to
the
last
i
have
no
objection
to
writing
exclusively
for
you
if
you
will
make
it
worth
my
while
sharp
again
whispered
tibbetts
to
his
partner
the
two
editors
then
withdrawing
into
a
further
corner
of
the
office
a
whispered
consultation
followed
during
which
ruth
heard
the
words
ca
afford
it
tom
hang
it
we
are
head
over
ears
in
debt
now
to
that
paper
man
good
articles
though
deuced
good
must
have
her
if
we
dispense
with
some
of
our
other
contributors
we
had
better
begin
low
though
as
to
terms
for
she
go
up
now
like
a
rocket
and
when
she
finds
out
her
value
we
shall
have
to
increase
her
pay
you
know
thank
you
gentlemen
thought
ruth
when
the
cards
change
hands
take
care
to
return
the
compliment
in
pursuance
of
tibbetts
shrewd
resolution
he
made
known
his
exclusive
terms
to
ruth
which
were
no
advance
upon
her
present
rate
of
pay
at
the
standard
this
offer
being
declined
they
made
her
another
in
which
since
she
would
not
consent
to
do
otherwise
they
agreed
she
should
write
over
her
old
signature
floy
furnishing
them
with
two
articles
a
week
ruth
accepted
the
terms
poor
as
they
were
because
she
could
at
present
do
no
better
and
because
every
pebble
serves
to
swell
the
current
months
passed
away
while
ruth
hoped
and
toiled
floy
fame
as
a
writer
increasing
much
faster
than
her
remuneration
there
was
to
pay
little
shoes
and
stockings
to
buy
oil
paper
pens
and
ink
to
find
and
now
autumn
had
come
she
could
not
write
with
stiffened
fingers
and
wood
and
coal
were
ruinously
high
so
that
even
with
this
new
addition
to
her
labor
ruth
seemed
to
retrograde
pecuniarily
instead
of
advancing
and
katy
still
away
she
must
work
harder
harder
good
brave
little
katy
she
too
was
bearing
and
hoping
on
mamma
had
promised
if
she
would
stay
there
patiently
she
would
certainly
take
her
away
just
as
soon
as
she
had
earned
money
enough
and
mamma
broke
her
promise
and
katy
prayed
to
god
every
night
with
childish
trust
to
help
her
mother
to
earn
money
that
she
might
soon
go
home
again
and
so
while
ruth
scribbled
away
in
her
garret
the
public
were
busying
themselves
in
conjecturing
who
floy
might
be
letters
poured
in
upon
lescom
with
their
inquiries
even
bribing
him
with
the
offer
to
procure
a
certain
number
of
subscribers
if
he
would
divulge
her
real
name
to
all
of
which
the
old
man
true
to
his
promise
to
ruth
to
keep
her
secret
inviolate
turned
a
deaf
ear
all
sorts
of
rumors
became
rife
about
floy
some
maintaining
her
to
be
a
man
because
she
had
the
courage
to
call
things
by
their
right
names
and
the
independence
to
express
herself
boldly
on
subjects
which
to
the
timid
and
were
tabooed
some
said
she
was
a
disappointed
old
maid
some
said
she
was
a
designing
widow
some
said
she
was
a
girl
and
all
said
she
was
a
nondescript
some
tried
to
imitate
her
and
failing
in
this
abused
and
maligned
her
the
outwardly
and
inwardly
corrupt
puckered
up
their
mouths
and
blushed
for
her
the
hypocritical
denounced
the
sacrilegious
fingers
which
had
dared
to
touch
the
ark
the
fashionist
voted
her
a
vulgar
plebeian
thing
and
the
earnest
and
sorrowing
to
whose
burdened
hearts
she
had
given
voice
cried
god
speed
her
and
still
floy
scribbled
on
thinking
only
of
bread
for
her
children
laughing
and
crying
behind
her
mask
laughing
all
the
more
when
her
heart
was
heaviest
but
of
this
her
readers
knew
little
and
would
have
cared
less
still
her
little
bark
breasted
the
billows
now
rising
high
on
the
topmost
wave
now
merged
in
the
shadows
but
still
steering
with
straining
sides
and
a
heart
of
oak
for
the
nearing
port
of
independence
ruth
brother
hyacinth
saw
floy
articles
floating
through
his
exchanges
with
marked
dissatisfaction
and
uneasiness
that
she
should
have
succeeded
in
any
degree
without
his
assistance
was
a
puzzle
and
the
premonitory
symptoms
of
her
popularity
which
his
weekly
exchanges
furnished
in
the
shape
of
commendatory
notices
were
gall
and
wormwood
to
him
must
be
done
and
that
immediately
seizing
his
pen
he
despatched
a
letter
to
millet
which
he
requested
her
to
read
to
ruth
alluding
very
contemptuously
to
ruth
articles
and
begging
her
to
use
her
influence
with
ruth
to
desist
from
scribbling
and
seek
some
other
employment
employment
he
did
not
condescend
to
state
in
fact
it
was
a
matter
of
entire
indifference
to
him
provided
she
did
not
cross
his
track
ruth
listened
to
the
contents
of
the
letter
with
the
old
bitter
smile
and
went
on
writing
chapter
lxv
a
dull
drizzling
rain
spattered
perseveringly
against
ruth
windows
making
her
little
dark
room
tenfold
gloomier
and
darker
than
ever
little
nettie
had
exhausted
her
slender
stock
of
toys
and
creeping
up
to
her
mother
side
laid
her
head
wearily
in
her
lap
wait
just
a
moment
nettie
till
mamma
finishes
this
page
said
ruth
dipping
her
pen
again
in
the
old
stone
inkstand
the
child
crept
back
again
to
the
window
and
watched
the
little
pools
of
water
in
the
streets
as
the
dimpled
them
and
saw
for
the
hundredth
time
the
grocer
boy
carrying
home
a
parcel
for
some
customers
and
eating
something
from
it
as
he
went
along
and
listened
to
the
milkman
who
thumped
so
loudly
on
the
back
gates
and
seemed
always
in
such
a
tearing
hurry
and
saw
the
baker
open
the
lid
of
his
boxes
and
let
the
steam
escape
from
the
smoking
hot
cakes
and
pies
nettie
wished
she
could
have
some
of
them
but
she
had
long
since
learned
to
and
then
she
saw
the
two
little
sisters
who
went
by
to
school
every
morning
and
who
were
now
cuddling
laughingly
together
under
a
great
big
umbrella
which
the
naughty
wind
was
trying
to
turn
inside
out
and
to
get
away
from
them
and
then
nettie
thought
of
katy
and
wished
she
had
katy
to
play
with
her
when
mamma
wrote
such
a
long
long
time
and
then
little
nettie
drew
such
a
heavy
sigh
that
ruth
dashed
down
her
pen
and
taking
her
in
her
arms
and
kissing
her
told
her
about
mistress
mcshuttle
who
lived
in
a
along
with
her
dog
and
her
cat
what
she
did
there
i
ca
tell
but
i
know
very
well
that
none
of
the
party
were
fat
and
then
she
narrated
the
exciting
adventures
of
the
wise
men
of
gotham
who
went
to
sea
in
that
rudderless
bowl
and
suffered
shipwreck
and
total
of
life
as
the
newsboys
god
bless
their
faces
call
it
and
then
little
nettie
snowy
lids
drooped
over
her
violet
eyes
and
she
was
far
away
in
the
land
of
dreams
where
there
are
no
little
hungry
girls
or
tired
scribbling
mammas
ruth
laid
the
child
gently
on
her
little
bed
and
resumed
her
pen
but
the
spell
was
broken
and
careful
and
troubled
about
many
things
she
laid
it
down
again
and
her
thoughts
ran
riot
pushing
aside
her
papers
she
discovered
two
unopened
letters
which
lescom
had
handed
her
and
which
she
had
in
the
hurry
of
finishing
her
next
article
quite
forgotten
breaking
the
seal
of
the
first
she
read
as
follows
to
i
am
rough
old
man
miss
and
not
used
to
writing
or
talking
to
ladies
i
do
know
who
you
are
and
i
do
ask
but
i
take
standard
and
i
like
your
pieces
i
have
a
family
of
bouncing
girls
and
boys
and
when
we
all
done
work
we
get
round
the
fire
of
an
evening
while
one
of
us
reads
your
pieces
aloud
it
may
not
make
much
difference
to
you
what
an
old
man
thinks
but
i
tell
you
those
pieces
have
got
the
real
stuff
in
and
so
i
told
my
son
john
the
other
night
and
says
and
say
and
neighbor
smith
who
comes
in
to
hear
says
that
you
ought
to
make
a
book
of
them
so
that
your
readers
may
keep
them
you
can
put
me
down
for
three
copies
to
begin
with
and
if
every
subscriber
to
standard
feels
as
i
do
you
might
make
a
plum
by
the
operation
suppose
now
you
think
of
it
n
john
says
maybe
you
be
offended
at
my
writing
to
you
but
i
say
you
got
too
much
common
sense
yours
to
command
john
stokes
well
well
said
ruth
laughing
that
a
thought
that
never
entered
this
busy
head
of
mine
john
stokes
publish
a
book
why
john
are
you
aware
that
those
articles
were
written
for
bread
and
butter
not
fame
and
tossed
to
the
printer
before
the
ink
was
dry
or
i
had
time
for
a
second
reading
and
yet
perhaps
there
is
more
freshness
about
them
than
there
would
have
been
had
i
leisure
to
have
pruned
and
polished
them
who
knows
i
put
your
suggestion
on
file
friend
stokes
to
be
turned
over
at
my
leisure
it
strikes
me
though
that
it
will
keep
awhile
thank
you
honest
john
it
is
just
such
readers
as
you
whom
i
like
to
secure
well
what
have
we
here
and
ruth
broke
the
seal
of
the
second
letter
it
was
in
a
delicate
beautiful
female
hand
just
such
an
one
as
you
dear
reader
might
trace
whose
sweet
soft
eyes
and
long
drooping
tresses
are
now
bending
over
this
page
it
said
dear
for
you
to
me
dear
as
a
sister
on
whose
loving
breast
i
have
leaned
though
i
never
saw
your
face
i
know
not
whether
you
are
young
and
fair
or
old
and
wrinkled
but
i
know
that
your
heart
is
fresh
and
guileless
and
warm
as
childhood
and
that
every
week
your
printed
words
come
to
me
in
my
sick
chamber
like
the
ministrations
of
some
gentle
friend
sometimes
stirring
to
its
very
depths
the
fountain
of
tears
sometimes
by
odd
and
quaint
conceits
provoking
the
mirthful
smile
but
i
love
you
best
in
your
serious
moods
for
as
earth
recedes
and
eternity
draws
near
it
is
the
real
and
tangible
my
soul
yearns
after
and
sure
i
am
that
i
am
not
mistaken
in
thinking
that
we
both
lean
on
the
same
rock
of
ages
both
discern
through
the
mists
and
clouds
of
time
the
sun
of
righteousness
i
shall
never
see
you
on
earth
mysterious
voices
audible
only
to
the
dying
ear
are
calling
me
away
and
yet
before
i
go
i
would
send
you
this
token
of
my
love
for
all
the
sweet
and
words
you
have
unconsciously
sent
to
my
sick
chamber
to
wing
the
weary
waiting
hours
we
shall
but
it
will
be
where
are
wiped
away
god
bless
you
my
unknown
sister
mary
r
ruth
head
bowed
low
upon
the
table
and
her
lips
moved
but
he
to
whom
the
secrets
of
all
hearts
are
known
alone
heard
that
grateful
prayer
chapter
lxvi
that
first
miserable
day
at
school
who
that
has
known
it
even
with
a
mother
kiss
burning
on
the
cheek
a
big
orange
bumping
in
the
new
satchel
and
a
promise
of
for
dinner
can
review
it
without
a
shudder
torturing
even
when
you
can
run
home
and
tell
mother
all
your
little
griefs
when
every
member
of
the
home
circle
votes
it
that
johnny
oakes
laughed
because
you
did
not
take
your
alphabet
the
natural
way
instead
of
receiving
it
by
inoculation
just
as
he
forgets
that
did
torturing
when
bill
smith
and
tom
simms
with
whom
you
have
swapped
alleys
and
played
hockey
are
there
with
their
familiar
faces
to
take
off
the
chill
of
the
new
schoolroom
torturing
to
the
sensitive
child
even
when
the
teacher
is
a
young
girl
instead
of
a
prim
old
ogre
poor
little
katy
her
book
was
before
her
but
the
lines
blurred
into
one
indistinct
haze
and
her
throat
seemed
filling
to
suffocation
with
sobs
the
teacher
if
he
thought
anything
about
it
thought
she
had
the
or
or
and
katy
kept
her
own
secret
for
she
had
read
his
face
correctly
and
with
a
child
quick
instinct
stifled
down
her
throbbing
little
heart
to
the
doctor
and
mis
hall
with
their
notions
a
school
was
a
school
the
committee
had
passed
judgment
on
it
and
i
would
like
to
know
who
would
be
insane
enough
to
question
the
decision
of
a
school
committee
what
did
the
committee
care
that
the
consumptive
teacher
for
his
own
personal
convenience
madly
excluded
all
ventilation
and
heated
the
little
stove
hotter
than
shadrack
furnace
till
little
heads
snapped
and
cheeks
crimsoned
and
croup
stood
ready
at
the
threshold
to
seize
the
first
little
bare
throat
that
presented
its
perspiring
surface
to
the
keen
frosty
air
what
did
care
that
the
desks
were
so
constructed
as
to
crook
spines
and
turn
in
toes
and
round
shoulders
what
did
they
care
that
the
funnel
smoked
week
after
week
till
the
curse
of
weak
eyes
was
entailed
on
their
victims
for
a
lifetime
they
had
other
irons
in
the
fire
to
which
this
was
a
cipher
for
instance
the
village
pump
was
out
of
repair
and
after
had
been
called
to
see
who
make
its
handle
fly
north
gotham
said
it
was
the
business
of
east
gotham
east
gotham
said
the
pump
might
rot
before
they
bear
the
expense
not
that
the
east
gothamites
cared
for
expense
no
they
scorned
the
insinuation
but
they
have
north
gotham
to
know
that
east
gotham
was
to
be
put
upon
jeremiah
stubbs
a
staunch
north
gothamite
stopped
buying
molasses
and
calico
at
ezekial
tibbs
east
gotham
finding
store
and
ezekial
tibbs
forbade
under
penalty
of
losing
his
custom
the
carpenter
who
was
repairing
his
from
buying
nails
any
more
of
jeremiah
stubbs
of
north
gotham
matches
were
broken
up
own
cousins
ceased
to
know
one
another
and
the
old
women
had
a
millenial
time
of
it
over
their
bohea
discussing
and
settling
matters
no
marvel
that
such
a
trifle
as
a
child
school
should
be
overlooked
meantime
there
stood
the
pump
with
its
impotent
handle
high
and
dry
a
gone
sucker
as
tibbs
facetiously
expressed
it
you
ca
go
to
school
katy
it
is
said
old
hall
go
get
that
stool
now
sit
down
on
it
at
my
feet
and
let
me
cut
off
those
foolish
dangling
curls
mamma
likes
them
said
the
child
i
know
it
replied
the
old
lady
with
a
malicious
smile
as
she
gathered
a
cluster
of
them
in
one
hand
and
seized
the
scissors
with
the
other
liked
them
said
katy
shrinking
back
no
he
did
replied
the
old
lady
or
if
he
did
was
only
to
please
your
foolish
mother
any
way
they
are
coming
off
if
i
like
them
that
enough
you
are
always
to
live
with
me
now
katy
it
makes
no
difference
what
your
mother
thinks
or
says
about
anything
so
you
need
quote
i
going
to
try
to
make
a
good
girl
of
you
if
she
will
let
you
alone
you
are
full
of
faults
just
as
she
is
and
i
shall
have
to
take
a
great
deal
of
pains
with
you
you
ought
to
love
me
very
much
for
it
better
than
anybody
else
in
the
world
do
you
no
response
from
katy
i
say
katy
you
ought
to
love
me
better
than
anybody
else
in
the
world
repeated
the
old
lady
tossing
a
handful
of
the
severed
ringlets
down
on
the
carpet
do
you
katy
no
answered
the
truthful
child
that
tells
the
whole
story
said
the
doctor
as
he
started
up
and
boxed
katy
ears
now
go
up
and
stay
in
your
room
till
i
send
for
you
for
being
disrespectful
to
your
grandmother
like
mother
like
child
said
the
old
lady
as
katy
half
shorn
moved
like
a
culprit
out
of
the
room
then
gathering
up
in
her
apron
the
shining
curls
she
looked
on
with
a
malicious
smile
while
they
crisped
and
blackened
in
the
glowing
lehigh
fire
but
miserable
as
were
the
sunday
after
all
was
the
dreadful
day
for
katy
the
long
long
long
sunday
when
every
book
in
the
house
was
put
under
lock
and
key
when
even
religious
newspapers
tracts
and
memoirs
were
tabooed
when
the
old
people
who
fancied
they
could
not
go
to
church
sat
from
sunrise
to
sunset
in
their
best
clothes
with
their
hands
folded
looking
speechlessly
into
the
fire
when
there
was
no
dinner
when
the
irish
girl
and
the
cat
equally
lawless
and
heretical
went
to
see
their
friends
when
not
a
sound
was
heard
in
the
house
save
the
ticking
of
the
old
that
stood
in
the
entry
when
katy
crept
up
to
her
little
room
and
crouching
in
a
corner
wondered
if
god
good
why
he
let
her
papa
and
why
he
did
not
help
her
mamma
who
tried
so
hard
to
earn
money
to
bring
her
home
the
last
bright
golden
beam
of
the
sabbath
sun
had
slowly
faded
away
one
by
one
the
stars
came
gliding
out
he
who
held
them
all
in
their
places
listening
ever
to
the
ceaseless
music
of
their
motion
yet
bent
a
pitying
ear
to
the
stifled
sob
of
a
troubled
child
softly
sweetly
fell
the
gentle
dew
of
slumber
on
weary
eyelids
while
angels
came
to
minister
tears
glittered
still
on
katy
long
lashes
but
the
little
lips
parted
with
a
smile
murmuring
papa
sleep
on
dream
on
little
katy
he
who
noteth
the
sparrow
fall
hath
given
his
angels
charge
to
keep
thee
chapter
lxvii
in
one
of
the
thousand
business
offices
in
one
of
the
thousand
crowded
streets
of
a
neighboring
city
sat
john
walter
with
his
legs
crossed
his
right
finger
pressed
against
the
right
lobe
of
his
organ
of
causality
his
right
elbow
resting
on
his
right
knee
and
the
fingers
of
his
left
hand
beating
a
sort
of
tattoo
on
a
fresh
copy
of
the
standard
which
lay
upon
the
table
by
his
side
his
attitude
was
one
of
profound
meditation
who
she
be
exclaimed
walter
in
a
tone
of
blended
interest
and
vexation
who
can
she
be
walter
raised
his
head
uncrossed
his
legs
took
up
the
standard
and
last
article
slowly
often
pausing
to
analyze
the
sentences
as
though
he
would
extort
from
them
some
hidden
meaning
to
serve
as
a
clue
to
the
identity
of
the
author
after
he
had
perused
the
article
thus
searchingly
he
laid
down
the
standard
and
again
exclaimed
who
she
be
she
is
a
genius
certainly
whoever
she
is
continued
he
soliloquizingly
a
bitter
life
experience
she
has
had
too
she
did
not
draw
upon
her
imagination
for
this
article
like
the
very
first
production
of
her
pen
that
i
read
it
is
a
wail
from
her
inmost
soul
so
are
many
of
her
pieces
a
few
dozen
of
them
taken
consecutively
would
form
a
whole
history
of
wrong
and
suffering
and
bitter
sorrow
what
a
singular
being
she
must
be
if
i
have
formed
a
correct
opinion
of
her
what
powers
of
endurance
what
an
elastic
strong
brave
loving
fiery
yet
soft
and
winning
nature
a
bundle
of
contradictions
and
how
famously
she
has
got
on
too
it
is
only
a
little
more
than
a
year
since
her
first
piece
was
published
and
now
her
articles
flood
the
whole
country
i
seldom
take
up
an
exchange
which
does
not
contain
one
or
more
of
them
that
first
piece
of
hers
was
a
stroke
of
genius
a
real
gem
although
not
very
smoothly
polished
ever
since
i
read
it
i
have
been
trying
to
find
out
the
author
name
and
have
watched
her
career
with
eager
interest
career
i
say
for
i
suppose
to
be
a
woman
notwithstanding
the
rumors
to
the
contrary
at
any
rate
my
wife
says
so
and
women
have
an
instinct
about
such
things
i
wish
i
knew
whether
she
gets
well
paid
for
her
writings
probably
not
inexperienced
writers
seldom
get
more
than
a
mere
pittance
there
are
so
many
ready
to
write
poor
fools
for
the
honor
and
glory
of
the
thing
and
there
are
so
many
ready
to
take
advantage
of
this
fact
and
withhold
from
needy
talent
the
moral
right
to
a
deserved
remuneration
thank
heaven
i
have
never
practiced
this
the
messenger
does
not
yield
me
a
very
large
income
but
what
it
does
yield
is
fairly
earned
why
bless
me
exclaimed
walter
suddenly
starting
up
and
as
suddenly
sitting
down
again
why
has
not
this
idea
occurred
to
me
before
yes
why
not
engage
to
write
for
the
household
messenger
how
i
wish
i
were
rich
that
i
might
give
her
such
a
price
as
she
really
deserves
let
me
see
she
now
writes
for
the
standard
and
the
pilgrim
four
pieces
a
week
for
each
eight
pieces
in
all
that
is
too
much
work
for
her
to
begin
with
she
can
not
do
herself
justice
she
ought
not
to
write
at
the
outside
more
than
two
pieces
a
week
then
she
could
polish
them
up
and
strengthen
them
and
render
them
as
nearly
perfect
in
execution
as
they
are
in
conception
one
piece
a
week
would
be
as
much
as
i
should
wish
could
i
possibly
afford
to
pay
her
as
much
or
more
for
that
one
piece
as
she
now
gets
for
eight
her
name
is
a
tower
of
strength
but
its
influence
would
be
frittered
away
were
she
to
write
for
more
than
one
paper
if
i
could
secure
her
pen
all
to
myself
the
advertising
that
such
a
connection
would
give
the
messenger
would
be
worth
something
ah
me
were
my
purse
only
commensurate
with
my
feelings
if
i
only
knew
who
is
and
could
have
an
interview
with
her
i
might
perhaps
arrange
matters
so
as
to
benefit
us
both
and
i
know
exclaimed
walter
jumping
up
and
pacing
the
room
rapidly
i
know
before
i
a
month
older
and
the
matter
was
settled
for
when
john
walter
paced
the
floor
rapidly
and
said
i
will
fate
folded
her
hands
chapter
lxviii
a
letter
for
said
lescom
smiling
another
lover
i
suppose
ah
when
you
get
to
be
my
age
continued
the
old
man
stroking
his
silver
hair
you
will
treat
their
communications
with
more
attention
as
he
finished
his
remark
he
held
the
letter
up
playfully
for
a
moment
and
then
tossed
it
into
ruth
lap
ruth
thrust
it
unread
into
her
apron
pocket
she
was
thinking
of
her
book
and
many
other
things
of
far
more
interest
to
her
than
lovers
if
lover
the
writer
were
after
correcting
the
proof
of
her
articles
for
the
next
week
paper
and
looking
over
a
few
exchanges
she
asked
for
and
received
the
wages
due
her
for
the
last
articles
published
and
went
home
ruth
was
wearied
out
her
walk
home
tired
her
more
than
usual
climbing
to
her
room
she
sat
down
without
removing
her
bonnet
and
leaning
her
head
upon
her
hand
tried
to
look
hopefully
into
the
future
she
was
soon
disturbed
by
nettie
who
exploring
her
mother
pockets
and
finding
the
letter
exclaimed
pointing
to
the
three
cent
stamp
may
i
have
this
pretty
picture
mamma
ruth
drew
forth
the
letter
opened
the
envelope
cut
out
the
stamp
for
nettie
who
soon
suspended
it
around
her
doll
neck
for
a
medal
and
then
read
the
epistle
which
ran
as
follows
to
madam
i
have
long
wished
to
communicate
with
you
long
wished
to
know
who
you
are
since
the
appearance
of
your
first
article
i
have
watched
your
course
with
deep
interest
and
have
witnessed
your
success
with
the
most
unfeigned
pleasure
my
reasons
for
wishing
to
make
your
acquaintance
at
this
particular
juncture
are
partly
business
and
partly
friendly
reasons
as
you
will
see
by
a
copy
of
the
household
messenger
which
i
herewith
send
you
i
am
its
editor
i
know
something
about
the
prices
paid
contributors
for
the
periodical
press
and
have
often
wondered
whether
you
were
receiving
anything
like
such
a
remuneration
as
your
genius
and
practical
newspaperial
talent
entitle
you
to
i
have
also
often
wished
to
write
you
on
the
subject
and
tell
you
what
i
think
is
your
to
speak
in
business
phrase
as
a
writer
so
that
in
case
you
are
receiving
a
just
compensation
as
things
go
you
might
know
it
and
act
accordingly
in
meditating
upon
the
subject
it
has
occurred
to
me
that
i
might
benefit
you
and
myself
at
the
same
time
and
in
a
perfectly
legitimate
manner
by
engaging
you
to
write
solely
for
my
paper
i
have
made
a
calculation
as
to
what
i
can
afford
to
give
you
or
rather
what
i
give
you
for
writing
one
article
a
week
for
me
the
article
to
be
on
any
subject
and
of
any
length
you
please
such
an
arrangement
would
of
course
give
you
time
to
take
more
pains
with
your
writing
and
also
afford
you
such
leisure
for
relaxation
as
every
writer
needs
now
what
i
wish
you
to
do
is
this
i
want
you
first
to
inform
me
what
you
get
for
writing
for
the
standard
and
the
pilgrim
and
if
i
find
that
i
can
afford
to
give
you
more
i
will
make
you
an
offer
if
i
can
not
give
you
more
i
will
not
trouble
you
further
on
that
subject
as
i
seek
your
benefit
more
than
my
own
in
case
you
should
accept
any
offer
which
i
should
find
it
proper
to
make
it
would
be
necessary
for
you
to
tell
me
your
name
as
i
should
wish
for
a
written
contract
in
order
to
prevent
any
possibility
of
a
misunderstanding
in
conclusion
i
beg
that
you
will
permit
me
to
say
that
whether
or
not
arrangements
are
made
for
you
to
write
for
me
i
shall
be
most
happy
to
serve
you
in
any
way
in
my
power
i
have
some
experience
in
literary
matters
which
i
will
gladly
place
at
your
disposal
in
short
madam
i
feel
a
warm
brotherly
interest
in
your
welfare
as
well
as
a
high
admiration
for
your
genius
and
it
will
afford
me
much
pleasure
to
aid
you
whenever
my
services
can
be
made
profitable
very
truly
yours
john
walter
ruth
sat
with
the
letter
in
her
hand
the
time
been
when
not
a
doubt
would
have
arisen
in
her
mind
as
to
the
sincerity
of
the
writer
but
alas
adversity
is
so
rough
a
teacher
ever
laying
the
cold
finger
of
caution
on
the
warm
heart
of
trust
ruth
sighed
and
tossed
the
letter
on
the
table
half
ashamed
of
herself
for
her
cowardice
and
wishing
that
she
have
faith
in
the
writer
then
she
picked
up
the
letter
again
she
examined
the
it
was
bold
and
manly
she
thought
it
would
be
treating
it
too
shabbily
to
throw
it
aside
among
the
trash
she
was
in
the
habit
of
receiving
she
would
read
it
again
the
tone
was
respectful
won
the
household
messenger
john
walter
she
certainly
had
heard
those
names
before
the
letter
stated
that
a
copy
of
the
paper
had
been
sent
her
but
she
had
not
yet
received
it
she
recollected
now
that
she
had
seen
the
household
messenger
among
the
exchanges
at
the
standard
office
and
remembered
that
she
always
liked
its
appearance
and
admired
its
editorials
they
were
fearless
and
honest
and
always
on
the
side
of
the
weak
and
on
the
side
of
truth
ruth
also
had
an
indistinct
remembrance
of
having
heard
walter
spoken
of
by
somebody
at
some
time
as
a
most
energetic
young
man
who
had
wrung
success
from
an
unwilling
world
and
fought
his
way
from
obscurity
to
an
honorable
position
in
society
against
what
would
have
been
to
many
overwhelming
odds
hence
the
reason
thought
ruth
his
heart
so
readily
vibrates
to
the
chord
of
sorrow
which
i
have
struck
his
experienced
heart
has
detected
in
my
writings
the
flutterings
and
desolation
of
his
own
ruth
wanted
to
believe
in
walter
she
glanced
at
his
letter
again
with
increased
interest
and
attention
it
seemed
so
frank
and
kind
but
then
it
was
bold
and
exacting
too
the
writer
wished
to
know
how
much
she
received
from
the
pilgrim
and
standard
and
what
was
her
real
name
would
it
be
prudent
to
entrust
so
much
to
an
entire
stranger
and
the
very
first
time
he
asked
too
even
granting
he
was
actuated
by
the
best
of
motives
would
he
not
think
if
she
told
him
all
without
requiring
some
further
guaranty
on
his
part
that
her
confidence
was
too
easily
won
would
he
not
think
her
too
indiscreet
to
be
entrusted
with
his
confidence
would
he
not
be
apt
to
believe
that
she
had
not
even
sufficient
discretion
on
which
to
base
a
business
arrangement
and
then
if
his
letter
dictated
by
idle
curiosity
only
how
unfortunate
such
an
of
her
affairs
might
be
no
she
could
not
do
it
but
then
if
walter
honest
if
he
felt
such
a
brotherly
interest
in
her
how
sweet
it
would
be
to
have
him
for
a
brother
a
brotherly
such
as
she
had
never
known
ruth
took
up
her
pen
to
write
to
walter
but
as
quickly
laid
it
down
oh
i
can
not
she
said
no
not
to
a
stranger
then
again
she
seized
her
pen
and
with
a
quick
flush
and
a
warm
tear
said
half
pettishly
half
mournfully
away
with
these
ungenerous
doubts
am
i
never
again
to
put
faith
in
human
nature
ruth
answered
walter
letter
she
answered
it
frankly
and
unreservedly
she
stated
what
wages
she
was
then
receiving
she
told
him
her
name
as
she
went
on
she
felt
a
peace
to
which
she
had
long
been
a
stranger
she
often
paused
to
wipe
the
tears
tears
of
happiness
from
her
eyes
it
was
so
sweet
to
believe
in
once
more
she
wrote
a
long
letter
a
sweet
sisterly
letter
pouring
out
her
long
feelings
as
though
walter
had
indeed
been
her
brother
who
having
been
away
ever
since
before
harry
death
had
just
returned
and
consequently
had
known
nothing
about
her
cruel
sufferings
after
she
had
sealed
and
superscribed
the
letter
she
became
excessively
frightened
at
what
she
had
done
and
thought
she
never
could
send
it
to
walter
but
another
perusal
of
his
letter
reassured
her
she
rose
to
go
to
the
and
then
became
conscious
that
she
had
not
removed
her
bonnet
and
shawl
but
had
sat
all
this
while
in
walking
costume
well
said
she
laughing
this
rather
however
it
is
all
the
better
as
i
am
now
ready
for
my
walk
ruth
carried
her
letter
to
the
dropping
it
into
the
with
more
hopeful
feelings
than
noah
probably
experienced
when
he
sent
forth
the
dove
from
the
ark
for
the
third
time
chapter
lxix
walter
sat
in
his
office
looking
over
the
morning
mail
i
wonder
is
this
from
he
said
as
he
examined
a
compact
little
package
it
bears
the
right
and
the
handwriting
is
a
lady
a
splendid
hand
it
is
too
there
character
in
that
hand
i
hope
is
walter
broke
the
seal
and
glancing
at
a
few
sentences
turned
to
the
signature
yes
it
is
now
for
a
revelation
he
then
commenced
perusing
the
letter
with
the
most
intense
interest
after
reading
the
first
page
his
eye
began
to
flash
and
his
lip
to
quiver
poor
girl
poor
girl
heartless
creatures
too
bad
too
bad
and
other
exclamations
rather
too
warm
for
publication
finishing
the
letter
and
refolding
it
he
paced
the
room
with
a
short
quick
step
indicative
of
deep
interest
and
determined
purpose
it
is
too
bad
he
exclaimed
shameful
the
whole
of
it
and
how
hard
she
has
worked
and
what
a
pitiful
sum
those
fellows
pay
her
it
is
contemptible
she
has
about
made
the
standard
it
never
was
heard
of
to
any
extent
before
she
commenced
writing
for
it
it
is
perfectly
outrageous
she
shall
not
write
for
them
another
day
if
i
can
help
it
i
will
make
her
an
offer
at
once
she
will
accept
it
and
then
those
jews
will
be
brought
to
their
senses
ha
ha
i
know
them
they
will
want
to
get
her
back
they
will
write
to
me
about
it
or
at
least
lescom
will
that
will
give
me
a
chance
at
him
and
if
i
do
tell
him
a
few
truths
in
plain
english
my
name
is
not
john
walter
then
seating
himself
at
his
desk
walter
wrote
the
following
letter
to
dear
sister
ruth
if
you
will
permit
me
to
be
so
brotherly
i
have
received
read
and
digested
your
letter
how
it
has
affected
me
i
will
not
now
tell
you
i
wish
to
say
however
that
on
reading
that
portion
of
it
which
relates
to
the
compensation
you
are
now
receiving
my
indignation
exhausted
the
dictionary
why
you
poor
dear
little
genius
what
you
write
for
those
two
papers
is
worth
to
the
proprietors
ten
times
what
they
pay
you
but
i
will
not
bore
you
with
compliments
i
wish
to
engage
you
to
write
for
the
household
messenger
and
here
is
my
offer
you
to
write
one
article
a
week
length
matter
and
manner
to
your
own
fancy
i
to
pay
you
the
engagement
to
continue
one
year
during
which
time
you
are
not
to
write
for
any
other
periodical
without
my
consent
my
reason
for
placing
a
limitation
to
our
engagement
is
that
you
may
be
able
to
take
advantage
at
that
time
of
better
offers
which
you
will
undoubtedly
have
i
enclose
duplicates
of
a
contract
which
if
the
terms
suit
you
will
please
sign
and
return
one
copy
the
next
the
other
copy
you
will
keep
unless
you
accept
my
offer
by
return
of
mail
it
will
be
withdrawn
you
may
think
this
exacting
i
will
explain
it
in
my
next
to
your
satisfaction
most
truly
your
friend
john
walter
this
letter
being
despatched
thanks
to
the
department
arrived
promptly
at
its
destination
the
next
morning
ruth
sat
with
walter
letter
in
her
hand
thinking
you
do
not
accept
my
offer
by
return
of
mail
it
will
be
withdrawn
how
exacting
explanation
of
this
to
be
given
in
my
next
letter
ah
john
walter
i
shall
not
have
to
wait
till
then
soliloquized
ruth
i
can
jump
at
your
reason
you
think
i
shall
mention
it
to
lescom
and
that
then
he
will
interfere
and
offer
something
by
way
of
an
equivalent
to
tempt
me
to
reject
it
that
it
john
walter
this
bumping
round
the
world
has
at
least
sharpened
my
wits
and
ruth
sat
beating
a
tattoo
with
the
toe
of
her
slipper
on
the
carpet
and
looking
very
profound
and
wise
then
she
took
up
the
contract
and
examined
it
it
was
brief
plain
and
easily
understood
by
a
as
the
men
say
it
is
a
good
offer
said
ruth
he
is
in
earnest
so
am
i
it
a
bargain
ruth
signed
the
document
chapter
lxx
good
afternoon
said
lescom
to
ruth
as
she
entered
the
standard
office
the
day
after
she
had
signed
the
contract
with
walter
i
was
just
thinking
of
you
and
wishing
for
an
opportunity
to
have
a
little
private
chat
your
articles
are
not
as
long
as
they
used
to
be
you
must
be
more
liberal
i
was
not
aware
replied
ruth
that
my
articles
had
grown
any
shorter
however
with
me
an
article
is
an
article
some
of
my
shorter
pieces
being
the
most
valuable
i
have
written
if
you
would
like
more
matter
lescom
i
wonder
you
have
not
offered
me
more
pay
there
it
is
said
lescom
smiling
women
are
never
satisfied
the
more
they
get
the
more
grasping
they
become
i
have
always
paid
you
more
than
you
could
get
anywhere
else
perhaps
so
replied
ruth
i
believe
i
have
never
troubled
you
with
complaints
but
i
looked
at
my
children
sometimes
and
thought
that
i
must
try
somehow
to
get
more
and
i
have
sometimes
thought
that
if
my
articles
as
you
have
told
me
were
constantly
bringing
you
new
subscribers
friendship
if
not
justice
would
induce
you
to
raise
my
salary
has
nothing
to
do
with
business
replied
lescom
a
bargain
is
a
bargain
the
law
of
supply
and
demand
regulates
prices
in
all
cases
in
literature
at
present
the
supply
greatly
exceeds
the
demand
consequently
the
prices
are
low
of
course
i
have
to
regulate
my
arrangements
according
to
my
own
interests
and
not
according
to
the
interests
of
others
you
of
course
must
regulate
your
arrangements
according
to
interests
and
if
anybody
else
will
give
you
more
than
i
do
you
are
at
liberty
to
take
it
as
i
said
before
is
one
thing
is
another
each
is
good
in
its
way
but
they
are
quite
distinct
as
lescom
finished
this
and
logical
speech
he
looked
smilingly
at
ruth
with
an
air
which
might
be
called
one
of
tyrannical
benevolence
as
if
he
would
say
well
now
i
like
to
know
what
you
can
find
to
say
to
that
i
am
glad
replied
ruth
that
you
think
so
for
i
have
already
acted
in
accordance
with
your
sentiments
i
have
had
and
accepted
an
offer
of
a
better
salary
than
you
pay
me
my
object
in
calling
this
afternoon
was
to
inform
you
of
this
and
to
say
that
i
shall
not
be
able
to
write
any
more
for
standard
lescom
looked
astonished
and
gazed
at
ruth
without
speaking
probably
because
he
did
not
know
exactly
what
to
say
he
had
argued
ruth
case
so
well
while
he
supposed
he
was
arguing
his
own
that
nothing
more
could
be
said
lescom
in
reality
valued
services
more
than
those
of
all
his
other
contributors
combined
and
the
loss
of
them
was
a
bitter
thing
to
him
and
then
what
would
his
subscribers
say
the
reason
of
ruth
leaving
might
become
known
it
would
not
sound
well
to
have
it
said
that
she
quit
writing
for
him
because
he
did
not
or
could
not
or
would
not
pay
her
as
much
as
others
just
then
it
occurred
to
him
that
engaging
to
write
for
another
journal
did
not
necessarily
preclude
the
possibility
of
her
continuing
to
write
for
the
standard
catching
eagerly
at
the
idea
he
said
well
i
am
really
glad
that
you
have
been
so
fortunate
of
course
i
wish
you
to
make
as
much
as
you
can
and
should
be
glad
did
my
circumstances
admit
to
give
you
a
salary
equal
to
what
you
can
command
elsewhere
but
as
i
can
not
give
you
more
than
i
have
been
paying
i
am
glad
somebody
else
will
still
i
see
no
reason
why
you
should
stop
writing
for
standard
your
articles
will
just
be
as
valuable
to
me
as
though
you
had
made
no
new
engagement
i
am
sorry
to
disappoint
you
lescom
replied
ruth
but
i
can
not
meet
your
wishes
in
this
respect
as
the
contract
i
have
signed
will
not
permit
me
to
write
for
any
paper
but
household
messenger
at
this
announcement
lescom
veil
of
good
nature
was
rent
in
twain
household
messenger
ah
it
john
walter
then
who
has
found
you
out
i
do
wish
to
boast
but
i
must
say
that
i
think
you
have
made
but
a
poor
exchange
the
whole
thing
is
very
unfortunate
for
you
i
was
just
making
arrangements
to
club
with
two
other
editors
and
to
offer
you
a
handsome
yearly
salary
for
writing
exclusively
for
our
three
papers
but
of
course
that
arrangement
is
all
knocked
in
the
head
now
it
seems
to
me
that
you
might
have
made
an
exception
in
favor
of
standard
i
have
no
doubt
that
walter
would
have
consented
to
let
you
write
for
it
as
it
was
the
first
paper
for
which
you
ever
wrote
he
would
probably
do
so
now
if
you
would
ask
him
he
is
an
editor
and
would
understand
the
matter
at
once
he
would
see
that
i
had
more
than
ordinary
claims
upon
you
what
do
you
say
to
writing
him
on
the
subject
i
have
no
objection
to
doing
so
replied
ruth
if
you
think
it
will
avail
anything
though
if
i
succeed
in
getting
walter
permission
to
write
for
i
suppose
tibbetts
of
the
pilgrim
will
wish
me
to
do
the
same
for
him
when
he
returns
i
called
at
the
pilgrim
office
this
morning
and
his
partner
elder
said
that
he
was
out
of
town
and
would
not
be
home
for
several
days
and
that
he
would
be
greatly
incensed
when
he
heard
i
was
going
to
leave
as
i
was
getting
very
popular
with
his
subscribers
elder
was
very
sorry
himself
but
he
treated
me
courteously
by
the
way
lescom
i
think
you
had
better
write
to
walter
as
well
as
myself
you
understand
such
matters
and
can
probably
write
more
to
the
point
than
i
can
very
well
said
lescom
i
will
write
to
him
at
once
and
you
had
better
write
now
by
the
same
mail
and
have
the
letters
both
enclosed
in
one
envelope
ruth
took
a
seat
at
the
editorial
table
and
wrote
to
walter
the
letters
were
sent
at
once
to
the
so
as
to
catch
the
afternoon
mail
and
ruth
took
her
leave
promising
to
call
on
the
morning
of
the
second
day
after
to
see
walter
reply
which
judging
by
his
usual
promptness
would
arrive
by
that
time
chapter
lxxi
ah
another
letter
from
said
walter
as
he
seated
himself
in
his
office
now
i
shall
hear
how
lescom
and
tibbetts
feel
about
losing
her
had
probably
told
them
by
the
time
she
wrote
and
they
have
probably
told
her
that
she
owes
her
reputation
to
them
called
her
ungrateful
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
let
us
see
what
she
says
after
reading
letter
walter
laid
it
down
and
began
muttering
out
his
thoughts
after
his
usual
fashion
just
as
i
expected
lescom
has
worked
on
kind
heart
till
she
really
feels
a
sort
of
necessity
not
to
leave
him
so
abruptly
and
requests
me
as
a
personal
favor
to
grant
his
request
at
least
for
a
time
no
no
not
unless
he
will
pay
you
five
times
as
much
as
he
pays
you
now
and
allow
you
besides
to
write
much
or
little
as
you
please
but
where
is
lescom
communication
ruth
says
he
wrote
by
the
same
mail
ah
here
it
is
walter
sir
hall
informs
me
that
you
have
engaged
her
to
write
exclusively
for
the
household
messenger
and
that
you
will
not
consent
to
her
writing
for
any
other
publication
perhaps
you
are
not
aware
that
was
the
first
to
introduce
to
the
public
and
that
i
have
made
her
reputation
what
it
is
this
being
the
case
you
will
not
think
it
strange
that
i
feel
as
if
i
had
some
claim
on
her
so
long
as
i
pay
her
as
much
as
she
can
get
elsewhere
i
need
not
say
to
you
that
the
standard
is
in
a
very
flourishing
condition
its
circulation
having
nearly
doubled
during
the
past
year
and
that
my
resources
are
such
as
to
enable
me
to
outbid
all
competitors
for
services
if
i
choose
to
take
such
a
course
but
i
trust
you
will
at
once
perceive
that
the
standard
should
be
made
an
exception
to
your
contract
and
permit
still
to
write
for
it
respectfully
yours
f
lescom
well
upon
my
word
exclaimed
walter
when
he
had
finished
lescom
letter
if
this
is
not
the
coolest
piece
of
egotism
and
impudence
that
i
ever
saw
but
it
is
no
use
wasting
vitality
about
it
i
will
just
answer
the
letter
and
let
things
take
their
course
i
have
the
of
him
now
and
i
keep
it
he
shall
have
my
reply
to
digest
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
i
write
to
first
though
on
the
designated
thursday
ruth
according
to
her
promise
called
at
the
standard
office
something
had
occurred
to
detain
lescom
so
she
sat
down
and
opened
walter
letter
which
lay
on
the
table
waiting
for
her
and
read
as
follows
dear
ruth
i
have
just
finished
reading
yours
and
lescom
letters
yours
has
touched
me
deeply
it
was
just
like
you
but
you
know
little
of
the
selfishness
and
humbuggery
of
some
newspaper
publishers
you
seem
really
to
think
that
you
ought
to
write
for
lescom
if
he
so
much
desires
it
this
is
very
good
of
you
and
very
amiable
but
forgive
my
want
of
gallantry
very
foolish
you
can
now
understand
if
you
did
not
before
why
i
desired
you
to
sign
the
contract
by
return
mail
i
was
afraid
if
you
went
to
lescom
or
tibbetts
of
the
pilgrim
signing
that
they
would
impose
upon
your
good
womanly
heart
and
thereby
gain
an
unfair
advantage
over
you
i
wished
to
surprise
you
into
signing
the
contract
that
i
might
have
a
fair
and
righteous
advantage
over
them
and
now
please
to
leave
the
whole
matter
to
me
i
shall
not
consent
to
your
writing
for
any
paper
unless
the
proprietors
will
give
you
the
full
value
of
your
articles
what
they
are
really
worth
to
them
if
things
turn
out
as
i
confidently
expect
they
will
from
your
present
popularity
you
will
soon
be
in
a
state
of
comparative
independence
on
the
next
page
you
will
find
a
copy
of
my
answer
to
lescom
letter
please
keep
me
informed
of
the
happenings
at
your
end
of
the
route
yours
most
truly
john
walter
ruth
then
read
walter
letter
to
lescom
as
follows
lescom
esq
sir
your
letter
in
regard
to
is
at
hand
you
say
that
perhaps
i
am
not
aware
that
were
the
first
to
introduce
to
the
public
and
that
have
made
her
reputation
it
is
fortunate
for
that
she
made
the
standard
the
channel
of
her
first
communications
to
the
public
i
know
this
very
well
but
i
am
not
aware
nor
do
i
believe
that
have
made
her
reputation
neither
do
i
think
that
you
believe
this
yourself
the
truth
is
simply
this
is
a
genius
her
writings
wherever
published
would
have
attracted
attention
and
stamped
the
writer
as
a
person
of
extraordinary
talent
hence
her
fame
and
success
the
fruits
of
which
have
principally
reaped
as
to
being
under
any
obligations
to
you
i
repudiate
the
idea
entirely
the
is
all
on
the
other
side
has
made
standard
instead
of
you
making
reputation
her
genius
has
borne
its
name
to
england
scotland
ireland
wherever
the
english
language
is
spoken
and
raised
it
from
an
obscure
provincial
paper
to
a
journal
you
say
that
you
are
wealthy
and
can
pay
as
much
as
anybody
for
services
i
wonder
this
has
never
occurred
to
you
before
especially
as
she
has
informed
you
frequently
how
necessitous
were
her
circumstances
you
also
inform
me
that
the
circulation
of
the
standard
has
nearly
doubled
the
past
year
this
i
can
readily
believe
since
it
is
something
more
than
a
year
since
commenced
writing
for
it
in
reply
to
your
declaration
in
case
you
are
driven
to
compete
for
services
you
can
outbid
all
competitors
i
have
only
to
say
that
my
contract
with
her
is
for
one
year
on
its
expiration
will
be
at
liberty
to
decide
for
herself
you
will
then
have
an
opportunity
to
compete
for
her
pen
and
enjoy
the
privilege
of
exhibiting
your
enterprise
and
liberality
your
servant
john
walter
ruth
waited
some
time
after
reading
these
letters
for
lescom
to
come
in
but
finding
he
was
still
unexpectedly
detained
she
took
a
handful
of
letters
which
the
clerk
had
just
received
by
mail
for
her
and
bent
her
steps
homeward
chapter
lxxii
the
first
letter
ruth
opened
on
her
return
was
a
request
from
a
professor
of
some
college
for
her
autograph
for
himself
and
some
friends
the
second
an
offer
of
marriage
from
a
southerner
who
confessed
to
one
hundred
negroes
but
hoped
that
the
strength
and
ardor
of
the
attachment
with
which
the
perusal
of
her
articles
had
inspired
him
would
be
deemed
sufficient
atonement
for
this
in
her
northern
eyes
the
frozen
north
he
said
had
no
claim
on
such
a
nature
as
hers
the
sunny
south
the
land
of
magnolias
and
orange
blossoms
the
land
of
love
be
her
chosen
home
would
she
not
smile
on
him
she
should
have
a
box
at
the
opera
a
carriage
and
servants
in
livery
and
the
whole
heart
and
soul
of
victor
le
pont
the
next
was
more
interesting
it
was
an
offer
to
floy
from
a
publishing
house
to
collect
her
newspaper
articles
into
a
volume
they
offered
to
give
her
so
much
on
a
copy
or
for
the
copyright
an
answer
was
requested
immediately
in
the
same
mail
came
another
letter
of
the
same
kind
from
a
distant
state
also
offering
to
publish
a
volume
of
her
articles
well
well
soliloquized
ruth
business
is
accumulating
i
see
but
i
shall
have
to
make
a
book
in
spite
of
myself
and
yet
those
articles
were
written
under
such
disadvantages
would
it
be
in
me
to
publish
so
soon
but
katy
and
copyright
money
ruth
glanced
round
her
miserable
dark
room
and
at
the
little
stereotyped
bowl
of
bread
and
milk
that
stood
waiting
on
the
table
for
her
supper
and
nettie
it
a
temptation
but
supposing
her
book
should
prove
a
hit
and
bring
double
treble
fourfold
that
sum
to
go
into
her
publisher
pockets
instead
of
hers
how
provoking
ruth
straightened
up
and
putting
on
a
very
resolute
air
said
no
gentlemen
i
will
sell
you
my
copyright
these
autograph
letters
and
all
the
other
letters
of
friendship
love
and
business
i
am
constantly
receiving
from
strangers
are
so
many
proofs
that
i
have
won
the
public
ear
no
i
will
not
sell
my
copyright
i
will
rather
deny
myself
a
while
longer
and
accept
the
and
so
she
sat
down
and
wrote
her
publishers
but
then
caution
whispered
what
if
her
book
should
sell
oh
pshaw
said
ruth
it
and
she
brought
her
little
fist
down
on
the
table
till
the
old
stone
inkstand
seemed
to
rattle
out
shall
ah
here
is
another
letter
which
i
have
overlooked
said
ruth
to
the
distinguished
and
popular
writer
madam
i
trust
you
will
excuse
the
liberty
i
take
in
writing
you
when
you
get
through
with
my
letter
i
am
thus
confident
of
your
leniency
because
it
seems
to
me
that
my
case
is
not
only
a
plain
but
an
interesting
one
to
come
to
the
point
without
any
circumlocutory
delay
i
am
a
young
man
with
aspirations
far
above
my
station
in
life
this
declaration
is
perfectly
true
in
some
senses
but
not
in
every
sense
my
parents
and
my
ancestors
are
and
were
highly
respectable
people
my
name
as
you
will
see
when
you
come
to
my
signature
is
reginald
danby
the
danby
family
madam
was
founded
by
sir
reginald
danby
who
was
knighted
for
certain
gallant
exploits
on
the
field
of
hastings
in
the
year
by
william
the
conqueror
sir
reginald
afterward
married
a
saxon
dame
named
edith
the
daughter
of
a
powerful
hence
the
danby
family
all
this
is
of
very
little
consequence
and
i
only
mention
it
in
a
sort
of
incidental
way
to
show
you
that
my
declaration
in
regard
to
the
respectability
of
my
family
is
true
and
fortified
by
unimpeachable
historical
evidence
and
i
will
here
remark
that
you
will
always
find
any
assertion
of
mine
as
well
sustained
by
copious
and
irrefragable
proof
the
respectability
of
our
family
being
thus
settled
i
come
back
to
an
explanation
of
what
i
mean
by
my
aspirations
above
my
station
in
life
it
is
this
i
am
poor
my
family
though
once
wealthy
is
now
impoverished
the
way
this
state
of
things
came
about
was
substantially
as
follows
my
grandfather
who
was
a
thrifty
gentleman
married
into
a
poetical
family
his
wife
was
the
most
poetical
member
of
said
family
much
of
her
poetry
is
still
extant
it
never
was
published
because
in
those
days
publishers
were
not
as
enterprising
as
they
are
now
we
value
these
manuscripts
very
highly
still
i
should
be
willing
to
send
you
some
of
them
for
perusal
in
case
you
will
return
them
and
pay
the
postage
both
ways
my
limited
means
not
permitting
me
to
share
that
pleasure
with
you
as
i
have
intimated
my
grandmother
reveled
in
poetry
she
doated
on
shakspeare
and
about
three
months
before
my
father
birth
she
went
to
a
theatre
to
witness
the
performance
of
midsummer
night
dream
she
was
enchanted
and
with
characteristic
decision
resolved
to
commit
the
entire
play
to
memory
this
resolution
she
executed
with
characteristic
pertinacity
notwithstanding
frequent
and
annoying
interruptions
from
various
causes
entirely
beyond
her
control
she
finished
committing
this
immortal
poem
to
memory
the
very
night
my
father
was
born
time
rolled
on
my
father
as
he
grew
up
exhibited
great
flightiness
of
character
and
instability
of
purpose
the
result
undoubtedly
of
his
mother
committing
midsummer
dream
to
memory
under
the
circumstances
which
i
have
detailed
my
father
owing
to
this
unfortunate
development
of
character
proved
inadequate
to
the
management
of
his
estate
or
indeed
of
any
business
whatever
and
hence
our
present
pecuniary
embarrassments
before
quitting
this
painful
branch
of
my
subject
it
will
doubtless
gratify
you
to
have
me
state
that
inasmuch
as
my
father
married
a
woman
of
phlegmatic
temperament
and
entirely
unpoetical
mind
the
balance
of
character
has
been
happily
restored
to
our
family
so
there
is
no
fear
for
me
i
am
thus
particular
in
my
statements
because
i
have
a
high
regard
for
truth
and
for
veracity
for
accuracy
in
the
things
a
phase
of
character
which
may
be
accounted
for
from
the
fact
that
i
have
just
gone
through
a
severe
and
protracted
course
of
mathematics
these
preliminaries
being
thus
fairly
before
you
i
now
come
to
the
immediate
topic
of
my
letter
viz
i
wish
to
go
through
college
i
have
not
the
means
i
wish
you
to
help
me
you
are
probably
rich
i
hope
you
are
with
all
my
heart
you
must
be
able
to
command
a
high
salary
and
a
great
deal
of
influence
i
do
ask
you
to
lend
me
the
money
out
of
hand
what
i
propose
is
this
i
will
furnish
you
the
subject
for
a
splendid
and
thrilling
story
founded
on
facts
in
the
history
of
our
family
the
danby
family
in
this
book
my
grandmother
poetry
would
probably
read
to
advantage
if
so
it
would
be
a
great
saving
as
her
writings
are
voluminous
your
book
would
be
sure
to
have
a
large
sale
and
the
profits
would
pay
my
expenses
at
college
and
perhaps
leave
a
large
surplus
this
surplus
should
be
yours
and
i
would
also
agree
to
pay
back
the
sum
used
by
me
from
my
first
earnings
after
graduation
i
have
thought
over
this
matter
a
great
deal
and
the
foregoing
strikes
me
as
the
only
way
in
which
this
thing
can
be
done
if
you
can
devise
a
better
plan
i
will
of
course
gladly
adopt
it
i
am
not
at
all
opinionated
but
am
always
glad
to
listen
to
anything
reasonable
please
let
me
hear
from
you
as
soon
as
possible
and
believe
me
truly
your
friend
and
admirer

chapter
lxxiii
tibbetts
the
editor
of
the
pilgrim
having
returned
from
the
country
ruth
went
to
the
pilgrim
office
to
get
copies
of
several
of
her
articles
which
she
had
taken
no
pains
to
keep
never
dreaming
of
republishing
them
in
book
form
tibbetts
was
sitting
at
his
editorial
desk
looking
over
a
pile
of
manuscript
ruth
made
known
her
errand
and
also
the
fact
of
her
being
about
to
publish
her
book
he
handed
her
a
chair
and
drawing
another
in
front
of
her
said
very
stiffly
my
partner
elder
hall
has
astonished
me
by
the
information
that
you
have
very
suddenly
decided
to
withdraw
from
us
who
first
patronized
you
and
to
write
for
the
messenger
yes
replied
ruth
i
considered
it
my
duty
to
avail
myself
of
that
increase
of
salary
my
circumstances
have
been
exceedingly
straitened
i
have
two
little
ones
dependent
on
my
exertions
and
future
as
well
as
my
own
to
look
to
you
have
often
told
me
that
you
already
paid
me
all
you
could
afford
so
it
was
useless
to
ask
you
for
more
beside
the
contract
i
have
accepted
obliged
me
to
decline
or
accept
it
by
return
of
mail
without
communicating
its
contents
ah
i
see
i
see
said
tibbetts
growing
very
red
in
the
face
and
pushing
back
his
chair
it
is
always
the
way
young
writers
treat
those
who
have
made
their
reputation
perhaps
making
my
reputation
may
be
a
question
open
to
debate
answered
ruth
stung
by
his
tone
i
feel
this
morning
however
disinclined
to
discuss
the
question
so
if
you
please
we
will
waive
it
you
have
always
told
me
that
you
were
constantly
beset
by
the
most
talented
contributors
for
patronage
so
that
of
course
you
will
not
find
it
difficult
to
supply
my
place
when
i
leave
you
but
you
shall
leave
said
tibbetts
turning
very
pale
about
the
mouth
and
closing
his
lips
firmly
not
repeated
ruth
rising
and
standing
erect
before
him
not
tibbetts
i
have
yet
to
learn
that
i
am
not
free
to
go
if
i
choose
well
you
are
said
tibbetts
that
is
a
little
mistake
of
yours
as
i
will
soon
convince
you
discontinue
writing
for
pilgrim
and
i
will
immediately
get
out
a
cheap
edition
of
your
articles
and
spoil
the
sale
of
your
book
and
he
folded
his
arms
and
faced
ruth
as
if
he
would
say
now
writhe
if
you
like
i
have
you
ruth
smiled
derisively
then
answered
in
a
tone
so
low
that
it
was
scarcely
audible
tibbetts
you
have
mistaken
your
auditor
i
am
not
to
be
frightened
or
threatened
or
said
she
turning
toward
the
door
even
had
i
not
myself
the
spirit
to
defy
you
as
i
now
do
for
i
will
never
touch
pen
to
paper
again
for
pilgrim
you
could
not
accomplish
your
threat
for
think
you
my
publishers
will
tamely
fold
their
arms
and
see
rights
infringed
no
sir
you
have
mistaken
both
them
and
me
and
ruth
moved
toward
the
door
stay
exclaimed
tibbetts
placing
his
hand
on
the
latch
when
you
see
a
paragraph
in
print
that
will
sting
your
proud
soul
to
the
quick
know
that
john
tibbetts
has
more
ways
than
one
of
humbling
so
imperious
a
dame
that
will
be
hardly
consistent
replied
ruth
in
the
same
calm
tone
with
the
commendatory
notices
of
the
boasts
you
have
made
of
the
almost
exclusive
right
to
the
services
of
so
bright
a
literary
of
course
you
will
not
see
such
a
paragraph
in
paper
replied
tibbetts
i
am
aware
most
logical
of
women
that
i
stand
committed
before
the
public
but
i
have
many
an
editorial
friend
scattered
over
the
country
who
would
loan
me
columns
for
this
purpose
as
you
please
said
ruth
it
were
a
act
but
your
threat
does
not
move
i
have
my
revenge
exclaimed
tibbetts
as
the
last
fold
of
dress
fluttered
out
the
door
chapter
lxxiv
those
of
my
readers
who
are
well
acquainted
with
journalism
know
that
some
of
our
newspapers
nominally
edited
by
the
persons
whose
names
appear
as
responsible
in
that
capacity
perhaps
contain
an
article
from
their
pen
the
whole
paper
being
made
up
by
some
obscure
individual
with
more
brains
than
pennies
whose
brilliant
paragraphs
metaphysical
essays
and
racy
book
reviews
are
attributed
and
tacitly
fathered
by
the
gentlemen
who
keep
these
their
factotums
in
some
garret
just
one
degree
above
starving
point
in
the
city
where
board
is
expensive
and
single
gentlemen
are
taken
in
and
done
for
under
many
a
sloping
attic
roof
are
born
thoughts
which
should
win
for
their
originators
fame
and
independence
horace
gates
a
gentlemanly
slender
person
held
this
nondescript
and
unrecognized
relation
to
the
irving
magazine
the
nominal
editor
ruth
brother
hyacinth
furnishing
but
one
article
a
week
to
deduct
from
the
immense
amount
of
labor
necessary
to
their
weekly
issue
heigho
said
gates
dashing
down
his
pen
four
columns
yet
to
make
up
i
am
getting
tired
of
this
drudgery
my
friend
seaten
told
me
that
he
was
dining
at
a
restaurant
the
other
day
when
my
employer
hyacinth
ellet
came
in
and
that
a
gentleman
took
occasion
to
say
to
how
much
he
admired
article
in
the
last
irving
magazine
on
life
article
it
took
me
one
of
the
hottest
days
this
season
in
this
furnace
of
a
garret
with
the
beaded
drops
standing
on
my
suffering
forehead
to
write
that
article
which
by
the
way
has
been
copied
far
and
wide
his
article
and
the
best
of
the
joke
is
seaten
says
the
cool
way
in
which
ellet
thanked
him
and
pocketed
all
the
credit
of
it
but
what
this
here
a
note
from
the
very
gentleman
himself
gates
sir
i
have
noticed
that
you
have
several
times
scissorized
from
the
exchanges
articles
over
the
signature
of
and
inserted
them
in
our
paper
it
is
my
wish
that
all
articles
bearing
that
signature
should
be
excluded
from
our
paper
and
that
no
allusion
be
made
to
her
in
any
way
or
shape
in
the
columns
of
the
irving
magazine
as
you
are
in
our
business
confidence
i
may
say
that
the
writer
is
a
sister
of
mine
and
that
it
would
annoy
and
mortify
me
exceedingly
to
have
the
fact
known
and
it
is
my
express
wish
that
you
should
not
hereafter
in
any
way
aid
in
circulating
her
articles
yours
hyacinth
ellet
what
does
that
mean
said
gates
sister
why
do
he
want
her
to
write
i
have
cut
out
every
article
of
hers
as
fast
as
they
appeared
confounded
good
they
are
too
and
i
call
myself
a
judge
they
are
better
at
any
rate
than
half
our
paper
is
filled
with
this
is
all
very
odd
it
stimulates
my
curiosity
amazingly
sister
married
or
unmarried
maid
wife
or
widow
she
ca
be
poor
when
he
so
well
off
gave
for
a
vase
which
struck
his
fancy
yesterday
at
martini
i
do
understand
it
and
mortify
him
exceedingly
what
he
mean
i
must
get
at
the
bottom
of
that
she
is
becoming
very
popular
at
any
rate
her
pieces
are
traveling
all
over
the
country
and
here
is
one
to
my
mind
as
good
as
anything
ever
wrote
ha
ha
perhaps
that
the
very
idea
now
perhaps
he
wants
to
be
the
only
genius
in
the
family
let
him
if
he
can
if
she
do
win
an
enviable
name
and
in
a
very
short
time
too
i
shall
be
mistaken
i
wish
i
knew
something
about
her
hyacinth
is
a
heartless
dog
pays
me
principally
in
fine
speeches
and
because
i
am
not
in
a
position
just
now
to
speak
my
mind
about
it
i
suppose
he
takes
me
for
the
pliant
tool
i
appear
by
jupiter
it
makes
my
blood
boil
but
let
me
get
another
and
better
offer
ellet
and
see
how
long
i
will
write
articles
for
you
to
father
in
this
confounded
hot
garret
sister
i
will
inquire
into
that
i
bet
a
box
of
cigars
she
writes
for
daily
bread
heaven
help
her
if
she
does
poor
thing
it
hard
enough
as
i
know
for
a
to
be
jostled
and
snubbed
round
in
well
well
it
no
use
wondering
i
must
go
to
work
what
a
pile
of
books
here
is
to
be
reviewed
wonder
who
reads
all
the
books
here
is
uncle
sam
log
house
ellet
writes
me
that
i
must
simply
announce
the
book
without
comment
for
fear
of
offending
southern
subscribers
the
word
i
know
has
been
tabooed
in
our
columns
this
long
while
for
the
same
reason
here
are
poems
by
lina
lintney
weak
as
diluted
water
but
the
authoress
once
paid
ellet
a
compliment
in
a
newspaper
article
and
here
is
her
of
merit
in
a
memorandum
attached
to
the
book
and
just
sent
down
by
ellet
this
volume
a
notice
bah
what
the
use
of
criticism
when
a
man
opinion
can
be
bought
and
sold
that
way
it
is
an
imposition
on
the
public
there
is
barolds
too
i
am
to
that
a
capital
notice
because
the
authoress
introduced
ellet
into
fashionable
society
when
a
young
man
the
grammar
in
that
book
would
give
lindley
murray
convulsions
and
the
construction
of
the
sentences
drive
blair
to
a
well
a
great
deal
the
dear
public
know
what
a
book
is
by
the
reviews
of
it
in
this
paper
heaven
forgive
me
the
lies
i
tell
this
way
on
compulsion
the
humbuggery
of
this
establishment
is
only
equalled
by
the
gullibility
of
the
dear
public
once
a
month
now
i
am
ordered
to
puff
every
paper
in
the
union
to
ward
off
attacks
on
the
irving
magazine
and
the
bait
takes
too
by
jove
that
little
mercury
has
not
muttered
or
peeped
about
hyacinth
when
abroad
since
ellet
gave
me
orders
to
praise
typographical
and
literary
excellence
of
that
paper
then
there
is
the
editor
of
bugbear
a
who
makes
the
mincing
aristocratic
hyacinth
quake
in
his
boots
i
have
orders
to
toss
him
a
occasionally
to
keep
his
plebeian
mouth
shut
something
after
the
french
maxim
to
praise
a
person
for
what
they
for
instance
very
neighbor
and
contemporary
the
discriminating
and
refined
editor
of
the
bugbear
whose
very
readable
and
spicy
paper
then
there
is
the
press
hyacinth
having
rather
a
damaged
reputation
is
anxious
to
enlist
them
on
his
side
particularly
the
editor
of
religious
platform
i
am
to
copy
at
least
one
of
his
editorials
once
a
fortnight
or
in
some
way
call
attention
to
his
paper
then
if
hyacinth
chooses
to
puff
actresses
and
call
mme
a
personation
of
womanhood
and
praise
her
equivocal
writings
in
his
paper
which
lies
on
many
a
family
table
to
be
read
by
innocent
young
girls
he
knows
the
caustic
pen
of
that
religious
editor
will
never
be
dipped
in
ink
to
reprove
him
that
is
the
way
it
is
done
mutual
bah
i
wish
had
a
paper
would
i
call
things
by
their
right
names
would
i
know
any
sex
in
books
would
i
praise
a
book
because
a
woman
wrote
it
would
i
abuse
it
for
the
same
reason
would
i
say
as
one
of
our
most
able
editors
said
not
long
since
to
his
reviewer
it
up
root
and
branch
what
right
have
these
women
to
set
themselves
up
for
authors
and
reap
literary
laurels
would
i
unfairly
insert
all
the
adverse
notices
of
a
book
and
never
copy
one
in
its
praise
would
i
pass
over
the
wholesale
swindling
of
some
aristocratic
scoundrel
and
trumpet
in
my
police
report
with
heartless
comments
the
name
of
some
poor
tempted
starving
wretch
far
less
deserving
of
censure
in
god
eye
than
myself
would
i
have
my
tongue
or
my
pen
tied
in
any
way
by
policy
or
interest
or
no
sir
the
world
never
will
see
a

till
mine

their
cracked
voices

cares
how
many

whose
she
leaned
gracefully
upon

whether

because

once
her
by
insulting

infamous
proposals
some
few
brainless
americans
choose
to
deify
her

hark
nettie
go
to
the
door
dear
said
ruth
some
one
knocked
it
is
a
strange
gentleman
mamma
whispered
nettie
and
he
wants
to
see
you
ruth
bowed
as
the
stranger
entered
she
could
not
recollect
that
she
had
ever
seen
him
before
but
he
looked
very
knowing
and
what
was
very
provoking
seemed
to
enjoy
her
embarrassment
hugely
he
regarded
nettie
too
with
a
very
scrutinizing
look
and
seemed
to
devour
everything
with
the
first
glance
of
his
keen
searching
eye
he
even
seemed
to
listen
to
the
whir
whir
whir
of
the
odd
strange
lodger
in
the
garret
overhead
i
do
recollect
you
said
ruth
hesitating
and
blushing
slightly
you
have
the
advantage
of
me
sir
and
yet
you
and
i
have
been
writing
to
each
other
for
a
week
or
more
replied
the
gentleman
with
a
smile
you
have
even
signed
a
contract
entitling
me
to
your
services
mr
walter
said
ruth
holding
out
her
hand
yes
replied
walter
i
had
business
this
way
and
i
could
not
come
here
without
finding
you
out
oh
thank
you
said
ruth
i
was
just
wishing
that
i
had
some
head
wiser
than
mine
to
help
me
decide
on
a
business
matter
which
came
up
two
or
three
days
ago
somehow
i
do
feel
the
least
reluctance
to
bore
you
with
it
or
a
doubt
that
your
advice
will
not
be
just
the
thing
but
i
shall
not
stop
to
dissect
the
philosophy
of
that
feeling
lest
in
grasping
at
the
shadow
i
should
lose
the
substance
said
she
smiling
while
ruth
was
talking
walter
keen
eye
glanced
about
the
room
noting
its
general
comfortless
appearance
and
the
little
bowl
of
bread
and
milk
that
stood
waiting
for
their
supper
ruth
observed
this
and
blushed
deeply
when
she
looked
again
at
walter
his
eyes
were
glistening
with
tears
come
here
my
darling
said
he
to
nettie
trying
to
hide
his
emotion
i
do
know
you
answered
nettie
but
you
will
my
dear
because
i
am
your
mamma
friend
are
you
katy
friend
asked
nettie
katy
repeated
walter
yes
my
katy
she
ca
live
here
because
we
do
have
supper
enough
pretty
soon
mamma
will
earn
more
supper
wo
you
mamma
sha
you
be
glad
when
katy
comes
home
and
we
all
have
enough
to
eat
said
the
child
to
walter
walter
pressed
his
lips
to
the
child
forehead
with
a
low
yes
my
darling
and
then
placed
his
watch
chain
and
seals
at
her
disposal
fearing
ruth
might
be
painfully
affected
by
her
artless
prattle
ruth
then
produced
the
different
publishers
offers
she
had
received
for
her
book
and
handed
them
to
walter
well
said
he
with
a
gratified
smile
i
am
not
at
all
surprised
but
what
are
you
going
to
reply
here
is
my
answer
said
ruth
provided
your
judgment
endorses
it
i
am
a
novice
in
such
matters
you
know
but
i
can
not
help
thinking
walter
that
my
book
will
be
a
success
you
will
see
that
i
have
acted
upon
that
impression
and
refused
to
sell
my
copyright
you
do
approve
it
said
she
looking
a
little
confused
as
walter
bent
his
keen
eyes
on
her
without
replying
but
i
do
though
said
he
i
was
only
thinking
how
excellent
a
substitute
strong
may
be
for
experience
your
answer
is
brief
concise
sagacious
and
i
endorse
it
unhesitatingly
it
is
just
what
i
should
have
advised
you
to
write
you
are
correct
in
thinking
that
your
book
will
be
popular
and
wise
in
keeping
the
copyright
in
your
own
hands
in
how
incredibly
short
a
time
you
have
gained
a
literary
reputation
floy
yes
answered
ruth
smiling
it
is
all
like
a
dream
to
me
and
then
the
smile
faded
away
and
she
shuddered
involuntarily
as
the
recollection
of
all
her
struggles
and
sufferings
came
vividly
up
to
her
remembrance
swiftly
the
hours
fled
away
as
walter
with
a
brother
freedom
questioned
ruth
as
to
her
past
life
and
drew
from
her
the
details
of
her
eventful
history
thank
god
the
morning
dawneth
said
he
in
a
subdued
tone
as
he
pressed
ruth
hand
and
bade
her
a
parting
ruth
closed
the
door
upon
walter
retreating
figure
and
sat
down
to
peruse
the
following
letters
which
had
been
sent
her
to
care
at
the
household
messenger
office
or
miss
permit
me
to
address
you
on
a
subject
which
lies
near
my
heart
which
is
in
fact
a
subject
of
pecuniary
importance
to
the
person
now
addressing
you
my
story
is
to
me
a
painful
one
it
would
doubtless
interest
you
were
it
written
and
published
it
would
be
a
thrilling
tale
some
months
since
i
had
a
lover
whom
i
adored
and
who
said
he
adored
me
but
as
shakspeare
has
said
course
of
true
love
never
did
run
smooth
ours
soon
became
an
affair
my
lover
proved
false
ceased
his
visits
and
sat
on
the
other
side
of
the
on
my
writing
to
him
and
desiring
an
explanation
he
insultingly
replied
that
i
was
not
what
his
fancy
had
painted
me
was
that
fault
false
fickle
ungenerous
man
but
i
was
not
thus
to
be
deceived
and
shuffled
off
no
i
employed
the
best
counsel
in
the
state
and
commenced
an
action
for
damages
determined
to
get
some
balm
for
my
wounded
feelings
but
owing
to
the
premature
death
of
my
principal
witness
i
lost
the
case
and
the
costs
were
heavy
the
excitement
and
worry
of
the
trial
brought
on
a
fever
and
i
found
myself
on
my
recovery
five
hundred
dollars
in
debt
i
intend
to
pay
every
cent
of
this
but
how
am
i
to
pay
it
my
salary
for
teaching
school
is
small
and
it
will
take
me
many
years
i
want
you
therefore
to
assist
me
by
writing
out
my
story
and
giving
me
the
book
i
will
furnish
all
the
facts
and
the
story
written
out
by
your
magic
pen
would
be
a
certain
success
a
publisher
in
this
city
has
agreed
to
publish
it
for
me
if
you
will
write
it
i
could
then
triumph
over
the
villain
who
so
basely
deceived
me
please
send
me
an
early
answer
as
the
publisher
referred
to
is
in
a
great
hurry
very
respectfully
yours
sarah
jarmesin
well
said
ruth
laughing
my
bump
of
invention
will
be
entirely
useless
if
my
kind
friends
keep
on
furnishing
me
with
subjects
at
this
rate
here
is
letter
no
dear
my
dog
fido
is
dead
he
was
a
splendid
newfoundland
black
and
shaggy
father
gave
for
him
when
he
was
a
pup
we
all
loved
him
dearly
he
was
a
prime
dog
could
swim
like
a
fish
the
other
morning
we
found
him
lying
motionless
on
the
somebody
had
poisoned
poor
fido
i
cried
all
that
day
and
did
play
marbles
for
a
whole
week
he
is
buried
in
the
garden
and
i
want
you
to
write
an
epithalamium
about
him
my
brother
john
who
is
looking
over
my
shoulder
is
laughing
like
everything
he
says
is
an
epitaph
not
an
epithalamium
that
i
want
just
as
if
did
know
what
i
want
john
is
just
home
from
college
and
thinks
he
knows
everything
it
is
my
dog
and
i
fix
his
tombstone
just
as
i
like
fellows
in
round
jackets
are
not
always
fools
send
it
along
quick
please
the
is
at
work
now
what
a
funny
way
they
cut
marble
do
they
with
sand
and
water
johnny
weld
and
i
go
there
every
recess
to
see
how
they
get
on
with
the
tombstone
do
stick
in
any
latin
or
greek
now
in
your
epithalamium
our
john
can
not
call
for
a
glass
of
water
without
lugging
in
one
or
the
other
of
them
i
sick
as
death
of
it
i
wonder
if
i
shall
be
such
a
fool
when
i
go
to
college
you
ought
to
be
glad
you
are
a
woman
and
do
have
to
go
do
forget
fido
now
remember
he
was
six
years
old
black
shaggy
with
a
white
spot
on
his
forehead
and
rather
a
tail
a
prime
dog
i
tell
billy
sands
it
is
a
harrowing
case
billy
said
ruth
but
i
shall
have
to
let
fido
pass
now
for
letter
no
dear
madam
i
address
a
stranger
and
yet
a
stranger
for
i
have
read
your
heart
in
the
pages
of
your
books
in
these
i
see
sympathy
for
the
poor
the
sorrowing
and
the
dependent
i
see
a
tender
love
for
helpless
childhood
dear
i
am
an
orphan
and
that
most
wretched
of
all
beings
a
loving
but
unloved
wife
the
hour
so
dreaded
by
all
maternity
draws
near
to
me
it
has
been
revealed
to
me
in
dreams
that
i
shall
not
survive
it
will
you
be
a
mother
to
my
babe
i
can
not
tell
you
why
i
put
this
trust
in
one
whom
i
have
only
known
through
her
writings
but
something
assures
me
it
will
be
safe
with
you
that
you
only
can
fill
my
place
in
the
little
heart
that
this
moment
is
pulsating
beneath
my
own
oh
do
not
refuse
me
there
are
none
in
the
wide
world
to
dispute
the
claim
i
would
thus
transfer
to
you
its
father
but
of
him
i
will
not
speak
the
is
my
rival
write
me
speedily
i
shall
die
content
if
your
arms
receive
my
babe
yours
affectionately
mary
andrews
poor
mary
that
letter
must
be
answered
said
ruth
with
a
sigh
ah
here
is
one
more
letter
miss
or
or
madam
floy
i
suppose
by
this
time
you
have
become
so
inflated
that
the
honest
truth
would
be
rather
unpalatable
to
you
nevertheless
i
am
going
to
send
you
a
few
plain
words
the
rest
of
the
world
flatters
you
i
shall
do
no
such
thing
you
have
written
tolerably
all
things
considered
but
you
violate
all
established
rules
of
composition
and
are
as
lawless
and
erratic
as
a
comet
you
may
startle
and
dazzle
but
you
are
fit
only
to
throw
people
out
of
their
orbits
now
and
then
there
a
gleam
of
something
like
reason
in
your
writings
but
for
the
most
part
they
are
unmitigated
trash
false
in
sentiment
unrhetorical
in
expression
in
short
were
you
my
daughter
which
i
thank
a
good
providence
you
are
not
i
should
box
your
ears
and
keep
you
on
a
bread
and
water
diet
till
you
improved
that
you
can
do
better
if
you
will
i
am
very
sure
and
that
is
why
i
take
the
pains
to
find
fault
and
tell
you
what
none
of
your
fawning
friends
will
you
are
not
a
genius
no
madam
not
by
many
removes
shakspeare
was
a
genius
milton
was
a
genius
the
author
of
of
the
dark
ages
which
has
reached
its
fifteenth
edition
was
a
genius
you
may
not
know
you
have
now
the
honor
of
being
addressed
by
him
no
madam
you
are
not
a
genius
nor
have
i
yet
seen
a
just
criticism
of
your
writings
they
are
all
either
or
you
have
a
certain
sort
of
talent
and
that
talent
i
grant
you
is
peculiar
but
a
genius
no
no
or
miss
or
madam
floy
you
do
approach
genius
though
i
am
not
without
a
hope
that
if
you
are
not
spoiled
by
injudicious
sycophantic
admirers
you
may
yet
produce
something
creditable
although
i
candidly
confess
that
it
is
my
opinion
that
the
mind
is
incapable
of
producing
anything
which
may
be
strictly
termed
your
honest
friend
william
stearns
of
greek
hebrew
and
mathematics
in
hopetown
college
and
author
of
of
the
dark
ages
oh
vanity
thy
name
is
william
stearns
said
ruth
chapter
lxxvi
have
you
ever
submitted
your
head
to
a
phrenological
examination
asked
walter
as
he
made
a
call
on
ruth
the
next
morning
no
said
ruth
i
believe
that
much
more
is
to
be
told
by
the
expression
of
people
faces
than
by
the
bumps
upon
their
heads
and
you
a
woman
of
sense
replied
walter
will
you
have
your
head
examined
to
please
me
i
should
like
to
know
what
finman
would
say
of
you
before
i
leave
town
well
yes
i
do
mind
going
said
ruth
provided
the
professor
does
not
know
his
subject
and
i
see
that
there
fair
play
said
she
laughing
but
i
warn
you
beforehand
that
i
have
not
the
slightest
faith
in
the
science
ruth
tied
on
her
bonnet
and
was
soon
demurely
seated
in
the
office
with
her
hair
about
her
shoulders
walter
sat
at
a
table
near
prepared
to
take
notes
in
you
have
an
unusually
even
head
madam
said
the
professor
most
of
the
faculties
are
fully
developed
there
are
not
necessarily
any
extremes
in
your
character
and
when
you
manifest
them
they
are
more
the
result
of
circumstances
than
the
natural
tendency
of
the
mind
you
are
of
a
family
where
there
was
more
than
ordinary
unity
in
the
connubial
relations
certainly
in
the
marriage
if
not
in
the
of
your
parents
your
physiology
indicates
a
predominance
of
the
nervous
temperament
this
gives
unusual
activity
of
mind
and
furnishes
the
capacity
for
a
great
amount
of
enjoyment
or
suffering
few
enjoy
or
suffer
with
such
intensity
as
you
do
your
happiness
or
misery
depends
very
much
on
surrounding
influences
and
circumstances
you
have
next
a
predominance
of
the
vital
temperament
which
gives
great
warmth
and
ardor
to
your
mind
and
enables
you
to
enjoy
physical
comfort
and
the
luxuries
of
life
in
a
high
degree
your
muscular
system
is
rather
defective
there
not
being
enough
to
furnish
real
strength
and
stamina
of
constitution
although
you
may
live
to
be
aged
you
will
not
be
able
to
put
forth
such
vigorous
efforts
as
you
could
do
were
the
motive
or
muscular
temperament
developed
in
a
higher
degree
you
may
think
i
am
mistaken
on
this
point
but
i
am
not
you
have
an
immense
power
of
will
are
energetic
and
forcible
in
overcoming
obstacles
would
display
more
than
ordinary
fortitude
in
going
through
trials
and
difficulties
and
possess
a
tenacity
of
purpose
and
perseverence
in
action
which
enable
you
to
do
whatever
you
are
determined
upon
doing
but
these
are
characteristics
not
and
your
mind
often
tires
out
your
body
and
leaves
you
in
a
state
of
muscular
prostration
your
phrenology
indicates
an
unusual
degree
of
respect
and
regard
for
whatever
you
value
as
superior
you
never
trifle
with
superiority
i
do
not
mean
conventional
superiority
or
bombastic
assumption
but
what
you
really
believe
to
be
good
and
noble
as
a
child
you
were
very
obedient
unless
your
sense
of
justice
which
is
very
strong
was
violated
in
such
a
case
it
was
somewhat
difficult
for
you
to
yield
either
ready
or
implicit
obedience
you
are
religiously
disposed
you
are
also
characterized
by
a
strong
belief
in
divine
influences
providences
and
special
interpositions
from
on
high
you
are
more
than
ordinarily
spiritual
in
the
tone
of
your
mind
you
see
or
think
you
see
the
hand
of
providence
in
things
as
they
transpire
you
are
also
very
conscientious
and
this
combined
with
your
firmness
which
is
quite
strong
and
supported
by
your
faith
in
providence
gives
you
a
striking
degree
of
what
is
called
moral
courage
when
you
believe
you
are
right
there
is
no
moving
you
and
your
friends
probably
think
that
you
are
sometimes
very
obstinate
but
let
them
convince
your
intellect
and
satisfy
your
conscience
and
you
will
be
quite
tractable
more
especially
as
you
are
characterized
by
unusual
sympathy
and
tenderness
of
feeling
you
too
easily
catch
the
spirit
of
others
of
those
you
love
and
are
interested
in
and
feel
as
they
feel
and
enjoy
or
suffer
as
they
do
you
have
very
strong
hope
with
reference
to
immortality
and
future
happiness
when
a
young
girl
you
were
remarkably
abounding
in
your
spiritual
anticipations
of
what
you
were
going
to
be
as
a
woman
you
possess
an
extraordinary
degree
of
perseverance
but
have
not
a
marked
degree
of
prompt
decision
after
you
have
you
act
energetically
and
are
more
sure
to
finish
what
you
commence
than
you
are
ready
to
begin
a
new
enterprise
you
are
decidedly
cautious
anxious
mindful
of
results
and
desire
to
avoid
difficulty
and
danger
you
take
all
necessary
care
and
provide
well
for
the
future
your
cautiousness
is
in
fact
too
active
you
place
a
very
high
value
on
your
character
are
particularly
sensitive
to
reproach
can
not
tolerate
scolding
or
being
found
fault
with
you
can
be
quite
reserved
dignified
and
even
haughty
you
are
usually
kind
and
affable
but
are
capable
of
strong
feelings
of
resentment
you
make
few
enemies
by
your
manner
of
speaking
and
acting
you
are
uniform
in
the
manifestation
of
your
affections
you
do
not
form
attachments
readily
or
frequently
on
the
contrary
you
are
quite
particular
in
the
choice
of
your
friends
and
are
very
devoted
to
those
to
whom
you
become
attached
you
manifested
these
same
traits
when
a
child
in
the
selection
of
playmates
your
love
is
a
mental
love
a
regard
for
the
mind
rather
than
the
person
of
the
individual
you
appreciate
the
masculine
mind
as
such
rather
than
the
physical
form
you
have
a
high
regard
for
chivalry
manliness
and
intellectuality
in
man
but
you
also
demand
goodness
and
religious
devotion
it
would
give
you
pain
to
hear
a
friend
speak
lightly
of
what
you
consider
sacred
things
and
i
hardly
think
you
would
ever
love
a
man
whom
you
to
be
irreligious
your
maternal
feelings
are
very
strong
you
are
much
interested
in
children
you
sympathize
with
and
understand
them
perfectly
you
are
yourself
quite
youthful
in
the
tone
of
your
mind
much
younger
than
many
not
half
your
age
this
taken
in
connection
with
your
sympathy
with
and
appreciation
of
the
character
of
children
enables
you
to
entertain
them
and
win
them
to
your
wishes
but
at
times
you
are
too
anxious
about
their
welfare
you
are
strongly
attached
to
place
and
are
intensely
patriotic
you
believe
in
plymouth
rock
and
bunker
hill
you
are
not
content
without
a
home
of
your
own
and
yet
in
a
home
of
your
own
you
would
not
be
happy
without
pleasant
surroundings
and
associations
scenery
and
such
things
as
would
facilitate
improvement
and
enjoyment
you
are
very
fond
of
poetry
and
beauty
wherever
you
see
it
of
oratory
sculpture
painting
scenery
flowers
and
beautiful
sentiments
you
must
have
everything
nice
you
can
not
tolerate
anything
coarse
or
gross
the
world
is
hardly
finished
nice
enough
for
you
you
are
too
exacting
in
this
respect
the
fact
is
you
are
made
of
finer
clay
than
most
of
us
you
are
particular
with
reference
to
your
food
and
not
easily
suited
you
must
have
that
which
is
clean
and
nice
or
none
whatever
you
do
such
as
embroidery
drawing
painting
needlework
or
any
artistic
performance
is
very
nicely
done
your
constructiveness
is
very
large
you
can
plan
well
can
lay
out
work
for
others
to
advantage
can
cut
out
things
and
invent
new
and
tasteful
fashions
your
appreciation
of
colors
is
very
nice
you
can
arrange
and
blend
them
harmoniously
in
dress
in
decoration
of
rooms
you
could
make
a
slim
wardrobe
and
a
small
stock
of
furniture
go
a
great
way
and
get
up
a
better
looking
parlor
with
a
few
hundred
dollars
than
some
could
with
as
many
thousands
you
exhibit
a
predominance
of
the
reflective
intellect
over
the
perceptive
and
are
characterized
for
thought
judgment
and
the
power
to
comprehend
ideas
more
than
for
your
knowledge
of
things
facts
circumstances
or
conditions
of
things
you
remember
and
understand
what
you
read
better
than
what
you
see
and
hear
still
you
are
more
than
ordinarily
observant
in
passing
along
the
street
you
would
see
much
more
than
people
in
general
and
would
be
able
to
describe
very
accurately
the
style
execution
and
quality
of
whatever
you
saw
you
have
a
pliable
mind
you
love
acting
and
would
excel
as
an
actress
you
have
great
powers
of
sarcasm
you
enjoy
fun
highly
but
it
must
be
of
the
right
kind
you
will
tolerate
nothing
low
you
are
precise
in
the
use
of
language
and
are
a
good
verbal
critic
you
ought
to
be
a
good
conversationist
and
a
forcible
and
spicy
writer
in
depicting
character
and
describing
scenes
you
would
be
apt
to
display
many
of
the
characteristics
which
dickens
exhibits
your
aptness
in
your
keen
sense
of
the
ludicrous
your
great
powers
of
amplification
and
the
intensity
of
your
feelings
would
enable
you
to
produce
a
finely
wrought
out
and
exquisitely
colored
picture
you
have
also
an
active
sense
of
music
are
almost
passionately
fond
of
that
kind
which
is
agreeable
to
you
you
have
more
than
ordinary
fortitude
but
are
lacking
in
the
influences
of
combativeness
your
temper
comes
to
a
crisis
too
soon
you
can
not
keep
angry
long
enough
to
scold
you
dislike
contention
you
read
the
minds
of
others
almost
instantaneously
and
at
once
form
a
favorable
or
unfavorable
impression
of
a
person
you
are
secretive
and
disposed
to
conceal
your
feelings
are
anxious
to
avoid
unnecessary
exposure
of
your
faults
and
know
how
to
appear
to
the
best
advantage
you
have
a
good
faculty
of
entertaining
others
but
can
be
with
persons
a
long
time
without
their
becoming
acquainted
with
you
you
dream
things
true
truth
comes
to
you
in
dreams
forewarnings
admonitions
you
are
liable
to
be
a
very
happy
or
very
unhappy
woman
the
worst
feature
of
your
whole
character
or
tone
of
mind
arises
from
the
influence
of
your
education
too
much
attention
was
paid
to
your
mind
and
not
enough
to
your
body
you
were
brought
forward
too
early
and
made
a
woman
of
too
soon
ideas
too
big
for
you
were
put
into
your
mind
and
it
was
not
occupied
enough
about
the
ordinary
affairs
of
life
this
renders
your
mind
too
morbid
and
sensitive
and
unfits
you
for
encountering
the
disagreeable
phases
of
life
you
can
endure
disagreeable
things
with
firmness
but
not
with
resignation
they
prey
both
on
your
mind
and
body
and
wear
heavily
upon
your
spirit
you
feel
as
though
some
one
must
go
forward
and
clear
the
way
for
you
to
enjoy
yourself
and
if
by
any
reverse
of
fortune
you
have
ever
been
thrown
on
your
own
resources
and
forced
to
take
care
of
yourself
you
had
to
learn
some
lessons
which
should
have
been
taught
you
before
you
were
sixteen
years
old
but
in
the
general
tone
of
your
mind
in
elevation
of
thought
feeling
sympathy
sentiment
and
religious
devotion
you
rank
far
above
most
of
us
above
many
who
are
perhaps
better
prepared
to
discharge
the
ordinary
duties
of
life
in
conclusion
i
will
remark
that
very
much
might
be
said
with
reference
to
the
operations
of
your
mind
for
we
seldom
find
the
faculties
so
fully
developed
or
the
powers
so
versatile
as
in
your
case
well
said
walter
with
a
triumphant
air
as
they
left
the
professor
office
well
what
do
you
think
i
think
we
have
received
our
worth
in
flattery
replied
ruth
laughing
there
is
not
a
whit
of
exaggeration
in
it
said
walter
the
professor
has
hit
you
off
to
the
life
well
i
suppose
it
would
be
wasting
breath
to
discuss
the
point
with
you
said
ruth
so
i
will
merely
remark
that
i
was
highly
amused
when
he
said
i
should
make
a
good
actress
i
have
so
often
been
told
that
true
comedy
would
be
your
forte
though
how
is
it
that
when
looking
about
for
employment
you
never
contemplated
the
stage
well
you
know
walter
that
we
descendents
hold
the
theatre
in
abhorrence
for
myself
however
i
can
speak
from
observation
being
determined
not
to
take
that
doctrine
on
hearsay
i
have
witnessed
many
theatrical
performances
and
they
only
served
to
confirm
my
prejudices
against
the
institution
i
never
should
dream
of
such
a
means
of
support
your
professor
made
one
great
mistake
for
instance
said
ruth
he
thinks
my
physique
is
feeble
do
you
know
that
i
can
walk
longer
and
faster
than
any
six
women
in
the
united
states
yes
replied
walter
i
know
all
about
that
i
have
known
you
under
a
strong
impetus
do
six
days
work
in
one
and
i
have
known
you
after
it
prostrated
with
a
nervous
headache
which
defied
every
attempt
at
mitigation
he
is
right
ruth
your
mind
often
tires
your
body
completely
out
another
thing
your
professor
says
i
do
not
like
to
be
found
fault
with
now
this
is
not
quite
true
i
do
not
object
for
instance
to
criticism
i
quarrel
with
no
one
who
denies
to
my
writings
literary
merit
they
have
a
right
to
hold
such
an
opinion
a
right
to
express
it
but
to
have
one
book
reviewed
on
hearsay
by
persons
who
never
looked
between
the
covers
or
to
have
isolated
paragraphs
circulated
with
words
italicized
so
that
gross
constructions
might
be
forced
upon
the
reader
which
the
author
never
could
dream
of
then
to
have
paragraphs
taken
up
in
that
state
credited
to
you
and
commented
upon
by
horrified
moralists
that
is
what
i
call
unfair
play
walter
when
my
sense
of
justice
is
thus
wounded
i
do
feel
keenly
and
i
have
sometimes
thought
if
such
persons
knew
the
suffering
that
such
thoughtlessness
to
baptize
it
by
the
most
charitable
name
may
cause
a
woman
who
must
either
weep
in
silence
over
such
injustice
or
do
violence
to
her
womanly
nature
by
a
public
contention
for
her
rights
such
outrages
would
be
much
less
frequent
it
seems
to
me
said
she
earnestly
were
i
a
man
it
would
be
so
sweet
to
use
my
powers
to
defend
the
defenceless
it
would
seem
to
me
so
impossible
to
use
that
power
to
echo
the
faintest
rumor
adverse
to
a
woman
or
to
keep
cowardly
silence
in
the
shrugging
sneering
slanderer
presence
when
a
bold
word
of
mine
for
the
cause
of
right
might
close
his
dastard
lips
bravo
ruth
you
speak
like
an
oracle
your
sentiments
are
excellent
but
i
hope
you
are
not
so
unsophisticated
as
to
expect
ever
to
see
them
put
in
universal
practice
editors
are
but
men
and
in
the
editorial
profession
as
in
all
other
professions
may
be
found
very
shabby
specimens
of
humanity
a
petty
fellow
is
seldom
improved
by
being
made
an
editor
of
on
the
contrary
his
pettiness
and
meanness
are
generally
intensified
it
is
a
pity
that
such
unscrupulous
fellows
should
be
able
to
bring
discredit
on
so
intelligent
and
honorable
a
class
of
the
community
however
said
walter
we
all
are
more
or
less
responsible
for
if
the
better
class
of
editors
refrained
from
copying
abusive
paragraphs
their
circulation
would
be
confined
to
a
kennel
class
whose
opinion
is
a
matter
of
very
little
consequence
by
the
way
ruth
said
walter
after
walking
on
in
silence
a
few
rods
how
is
it
in
these
days
of
female
preachers
that
you
never
contemplated
the
pulpit
or
as
for
the
replied
ruth
i
had
as
great
a
horror
of
that
as
far
as
i
myself
am
concerned
as
the
profession
of
an
actress
but
not
long
since
i
heard
the
eloquent
miss
lucy
stone
one
evening
when
it
really
did
appear
to
me
that
those
bloomers
of
hers
had
a
mission
still
i
never
could
put
them
on
and
as
to
the
pulpit
i
have
too
much
reverence
for
that
to
think
of
putting
my
profane
foot
in
it
it
is
part
of
my
creed
that
a
congregation
can
no
more
repay
a
conscientious
devoted
minister
than
can
help
your
sentiments
said
walter
laughing
as
you
please
replied
ruth
but
people
who
live
in
glass
houses
should
not
throw
stones
but
here
we
are
at
home
do
you
hear
the
whir
chapter
lxxvii
and
now
our
heroine
had
become
a
regular
business
woman
she
did
not
even
hear
the
whir
whir
of
the
odd
lodger
in
the
attic
the
little
room
was
littered
with
newspapers
envelopes
letters
opened
and
unopened
answered
and
waiting
to
be
answered
one
minute
she
might
be
seen
sitting
pen
in
hand
trying
with
knit
brows
to
decipher
some
horrible
cabalistic
printer
mark
on
the
margin
of
her
proof
then
writing
an
article
for
walter
then
scribbling
a
business
letter
to
her
publishers
stopping
occasionally
to
administer
a
sedative
to
nettie
in
the
shape
of
a
timely
quotation
from
mother
goose
or
to
heal
a
fracture
in
a
doll
leg
or
arm
now
she
was
washing
a
little
soiled
face
or
smoothing
little
rumpled
ringlets
replacing
a
missing
or
pinafore
button
then
wading
through
the
streets
while
boreas
contested
stoutly
for
her
umbrella
with
parcels
and
letters
to
the
for
ruth
must
be
her
own
servant
regardless
of
gutters
or
thermometers
regardless
of
jostling
or
crowding
what
cared
she
for
all
these
when
katy
would
soon
be
back
poor
little
patient
suffering
katy
ruth
felt
as
if
wings
were
growing
from
her
shoulders
she
never
was
weary
or
sleepy
or
hungry
she
had
not
the
slightest
idea
till
long
after
what
an
incredible
amount
of
labor
she
accomplished
or
how
her
was
goading
her
on
pressing
business
that
mis
hall
must
have
said
her
landlady
with
a
sneer
as
ruth
stood
her
dripping
umbrella
in
the
kitchen
sink
pressing
business
running
round
to
offices
and
the
like
of
that
in
such
a
storm
as
this
you
would
catch
doing
it
if
i
was
a
widder
i
hope
i
have
more
regard
for
appearances
i
do
understand
all
this
flying
in
and
out
one
minute
up
in
her
room
the
next
in
the
street
forty
times
a
day
and
letters
by
the
wholesale
it
will
take
me
to
inquire
into
it
it
may
be
all
right
hope
it
is
but
of
course
i
like
to
know
what
is
going
on
in
my
house
this
mis
hall
is
so
terrible
i
do
like
it
i
thought
a
dozen
times
i
like
to
ask
her
right
straight
out
who
and
what
she
is
and
done
with
it
but
i
have
not
forgotten
that
little
matter
about
the
pills
and
when
i
see
her
there
something
about
her
she
civil
enough
too
that
seems
to
say
you
cross
that
sally
waters
i
never
had
lodgers
afore
like
her
and
that
old
bond
up
in
the
garret
they
are
as
much
alike
as
two
peas
goes
scratch
scratch
scratch
goes
whir
whir
whir
they
haint
spoke
a
word
to
one
another
since
that
child
was
sick
it
enough
to
drive
anybody
mad
to
have
such
a
mystery
in
the
house
i
ca
make
head
nor
tail
o
john
now
he
do
care
a
about
it
no
more
he
would
if
the
top
of
the
house
was
to
blow
off
but
there
nothing
plagues
like
it
and
yet
i
aint
a
bit
curous
nuther
well
neither
she
nor
bond
make
me
any
trouble
there
that
in
it
if
they
did
i
would
stand
it
and
as
long
as
they
both
pay
their
bills
so
i
sha
make
a
fuss
i
like
to
know
though
what
mis
hall
is
about
all
the
time
publication
day
came
at
last
there
was
book
ruth
book
oh
how
few
of
its
readers
if
it
were
fortunate
enough
to
find
readers
would
know
how
much
of
her
own
heart
history
was
there
laid
bare
yes
there
was
the
book
she
could
recall
the
circumstances
under
which
each
separate
article
was
written
little
shoeless
feet
were
covered
with
the
proceeds
of
this
a
little
medicine
or
a
warmer
shawl
was
bought
with
that
this
was
written
faint
and
fasting
late
into
the
long
night
that
composed
while
walking
wearily
to
or
from
the
offices
where
she
was
employed
one
was
written
with
little
nettie
sleeping
in
her
lap
another
still
a
mirthful
merry
piece
as
an
for
a
wretched
heartache
each
had
its
own
little
history
each
would
serve
in
for
a
to
some
thorny
path
of
trouble
oh
if
the
sun
of
prosperity
after
all
should
gild
these
rugged
paths
some
virtues
many
faults
the
book
had
but
god
speed
it
for
little
katy
sake
let
me
see
please
said
little
nettie
attracted
by
the
gilt
covers
as
she
reached
out
her
hand
for
the
book
did
you
make
those
pretty
pictures
mamma
no
my
dear
a
gentleman
an
artist
made
those
for
me
make
pictures
with
show
me
one
of
your
pictures
mamma
said
nettie
ruth
took
the
child
upon
her
lap
and
read
her
the
story
of
gertrude
nettie
listened
with
her
clear
eyes
fixed
upon
her
mother
face
do
make
her
die
oh
please
do
make
her
die
mamma
exclaimed
the
sensitive
child
laying
her
little
hand
over
her
mother
mouth
ruth
smiled
and
improvised
a
favorable
termination
to
her
story
more
suitable
to
her
audience
that
is
nice
said
nettie
kissing
her
mother
when
i
get
to
be
a
woman
shall
i
write
books
mamma
god
forbid
murmured
ruth
kissing
the
child
changeful
cheek
god
forbid
murmured
she
musingly
as
she
turned
over
the
leaves
of
her
book
no
happy
woman
ever
writes
from
harry
grave
sprang
chapter
lxxviii
you
have
a
noble
place
here
said
a
gentleman
to
ruth
brother
hyacinth
as
he
seated
himself
on
the
piazza
and
his
eye
lingered
first
upon
the
velvet
lawn
with
its
little
clumps
of
trees
sloping
down
to
the
river
then
upon
the
feathery
willows
now
dipping
their
light
green
branches
playfully
into
the
water
then
tossing
them
gleefully
up
to
the
sunlight
a
noble
place
said
he
as
he
marked
the
hazy
outline
of
the
cliffs
on
the
opposite
side
and
the
blue
river
which
laved
their
base
flecked
with
many
a
snowy
sail
it
were
treason
not
to
be
poetical
here
i
should
catch
the
infection
myself
as
i
am
do
you
see
that
steamer
yonder
floating
down
the
river
lewis
said
hyacinth
do
you
know
her
no
well
she
is
named
after
my
sister
by
one
of
her
literary
admirers
the
sister
your
why
everybody
is
going
mad
to
know
who
she
is
exactly
replied
hyacinth
running
his
white
fingers
through
his
curls
is
my
sister
why
the
deuce
did
you
tell
a
fellow
before
i
have
wasted
more
pens
ink
and
breath
trying
to
find
her
out
than
i
can
stop
to
tell
you
about
now
and
here
you
have
kept
as
mum
as
a
mouse
all
the
time
what
did
you
do
it
for
oh
well
said
hyacinth
coloring
a
little
had
an
odd
fancy
for
being
and
i
being
in
her
confidence
you
know
was
on
honor
to
keep
her
secret
but
she
wishes
it
said
lewis
so
her
publishers
whom
i
have
vainly
pumped
tell
me
so
as
far
as
that
goes
i
do
see
why
you
could
not
have
told
me
before
just
as
well
as
now
hyacinth
very
suddenly
became
aware
of
an
odd
craft
in
the
river
and
was
apparently
intensely
absorbed
looking
at
it
through
his
hyacinth
i
say
hyacinth
said
the
pertinacious
lewis
i
believe
after
all
you
are
humbugging
me
how
she
be
your
sister
a
paragraph
in
sentinel
saying
and
lewis
drew
the
paper
from
his
pocket
unfolded
it
and
put
on
his
glasses
with
distressing
deliberation
understand
that
floy
the
new
literary
star
was
in
very
destitute
circumstances
when
she
first
solicited
the
patronage
of
the
public
often
wandering
from
one
editorial
office
to
another
in
search
of
employment
while
wanting
the
commonest
necessaries
of
life
there
now
how
can
that
be
if
she
is
sister
and
you
an
editor
too
always
patronizing
some
new
contributor
with
a
flourish
of
trumpets
pooh
man
you
are
hoaxing
and
lewis
jogged
him
again
by
the
elbow
beg
your
pardon
my
dear
boy
said
hyacinth
blandly
but
my
honor
i
have
heard
a
word
you
were
saying
i
was
so
intent
upon
making
out
that
craft
down
the
river
i
a
little
afraid
of
that
fog
coming
up
lewis
suppose
we
join
ellet
in
the
odd
very
odd
soliloquized
lewis
i
try
him
did
you
read
the
panegyric
on
in
inquisitor
of
this
morning
said
lewis
that
paper
you
know
is
decidedly
the
highest
literary
authority
in
the
country
it
pronounces
book
to
be
an
work
of
genius
yes
replied
hyacinth
i
saw
it
it
is
a
great
thing
lewis
for
a
young
writer
to
be
and
hyacinth
pulled
up
his
but
i
understood
you
just
now
that
nobody
knew
she
your
sister
when
she
first
published
the
pieces
that
are
now
collected
in
that
book
said
lewis
with
his
characteristic
pertinacity
there
that
craft
again
said
hyacinth
ca
you
make
her
out
lewis
no
by
jove
replied
lewis
sarcastically
i
ca
make
anything
out
i
never
was
so
in
my
life
and
he
bent
a
penetrating
glance
on
the
masked
face
before
him
it
is
past
my
finding
out
at
least
just
now
but
i
a
yankee
tongue
in
my
head
so
i
do
despair
with
time
and
perseverance
and
lewis
followed
hyacinth
into
the
house
confounded
disagreeable
fellow
soliloquized
hyacinth
as
he
handed
him
over
to
a
knot
of
ladies
in
the
very
awkward
that
paragraph
i
wish
i
had
the
fellow
who
wrote
it
at
distance
just
now
well
if
i
am
badgered
on
the
subject
of
poverty
i
shall
start
a
paragraph
saying
that
the
story
is
only
a
trick
to
make
her
book
sell
by
jove
they
do
corner
me
i
have
got
out
of
worse
scrapes
than
that
before
now
by
the
help
of
my
wits
and
the
lawyers
but
i
do
think
a
paper
of
any
influence
would
attack
me
on
that
point
i
have
taken
care
to
secure
all
the
more
prominent
ones
long
ago
by
judicious
puffs
of
their
editors
in
the
irving
magazine
the
only
one
i
fear
is
the
and
i
will
lay
an
anchor
to
windward
there
this
very
week
by
praising
the
editor
last
stupid
editorial
what
an
unmitigated
donkey
that
fellow
is
chapter
lxxix
how
are
you
walter
said
lewis
extending
his
hand
fine
day
how
goes
the
world
with
you
they
say
are
a
man
who
dares
to
to
the
line
let
the
chips
fly
in
whose
face
they
will
now
i
want
you
to
tell
me
if
is
a
sister
of
hyacinth
ellet
the
editor
of
irving
magazine
i
can
not
believe
it
though
he
boasted
of
it
to
me
the
other
day
i
hear
such
accounts
of
her
struggles
and
her
poverty
i
can
not
see
into
it
it
is
very
easily
understood
said
walter
with
a
dark
frown
on
his
face
hyacinth
ellet
has
always
had
one
hobby
namely
social
position
for
that
he
would
sacrifice
the
dearest
friend
or
nearest
relative
he
had
on
earth
his
sister
was
once
in
affluent
circumstances
beloved
and
admired
by
all
who
knew
her
hyacinth
at
that
time
was
very
friendly
of
course
her
husband
wine
and
horses
and
his
name
on
change
were
things
which
the
extravagant
hyacinth
knew
how
to
appreciate
hall
husband
was
a
impulsive
fellow
too
noble
himself
to
see
through
the
specious
flimsy
veil
which
covered
so
corrupt
a
heart
as
hyacinth
had
he
been
less
trusting
less
generous
to
him
might
not
have
been
left
so
destitute
at
his
death
when
that
event
occurred
hyacinth
regard
for
his
sister
evaporated
in
a
lachrymose
obituary
notice
of
hall
in
the
irving
magazine
the
very
day
after
his
death
hyacinth
married
julia
grey
or
rather
married
her
fortune
his
sister
after
seeking
in
vain
to
get
employment
driven
to
despair
at
last
resorted
to
her
pen
and
applied
to
hyacinth
then
the
prosperous
editor
of
the
irving
magazine
either
to
give
her
employment
as
a
writer
or
show
her
some
way
to
obtain
it
at
that
time
hyacinth
was
constantly
boasting
of
the
helping
hand
he
had
extended
to
young
writers
in
their
extremity
whom
by
the
way
he
paid
in
compliments
after
securing
their
articles
and
whom
he
was
constantly
asserting
had
been
raised
by
him
from
obscurity
to
fame
well
said
lewis
bending
eagerly
forward
well
he
helped
his
sister
of
course
he
did
no
such
thing
sir
said
walter
bringing
his
hand
down
on
the
table
he
did
no
such
thing
sir
but
he
wrote
her
a
cool
contemptuous
insulting
letter
denying
her
all
claim
to
talent
she
had
sent
him
some
specimen
articles
and
advising
her
to
seek
some
unobtrusive
employment
employment
he
did
not
trouble
himself
to
name
and
then
ignored
her
existence
and
this
too
when
he
was
squandering
money
on
actresses
etc
well
said
lewis
inquiringly
well
sir
she
struggled
on
bravely
and
with
the
skeleton
starvation
standing
by
her
she
who
had
never
known
a
wish
ungratified
during
her
married
life
whose
husband
pride
in
her
was
only
equalled
by
his
love
she
has
sunk
fainting
to
the
floor
with
hunger
that
her
children
might
not
go
supperless
to
bed
and
now
when
the
battle
is
fought
and
the
victory
won
comes
in
for
a
share
of
the
spoils
it
is
sister
floy
and
is
reputation
which
was
the
to
her
celebrity
as
a
writer
to
show
you
how
much
reputation
has
helped
her
i
will
just
state
that
not
long
since
i
was
dining
at
a
restaurant
near
two
young
men
who
were
discussing
one
says
you
read
her
book
said
the
other
with
a
sneer
do
i
want
to
it
is
enough
for
me
that
hyacinth
ellet
claims
her
as
a
sister
is
enough
to
damn
any
woman
then
continued
walter
there
was
an
english
paper
the
editor
of
which
disgusted
with
hyacinth
toadyisms
fopperies
and
impudence
while
abroad
took
occasion
to
cut
up
her
book
as
he
acknowledged
because
the
writer
was
said
to
be
ellet
sister
that
is
the
way
reputation
has
helped
her
no
wonder
she
is
at
with
him
remarked
lewis
she
is
not
at
with
him
replied
walter
she
simply
chooses
to
retain
the
position
her
family
assigned
her
when
she
was
poor
and
obscure
they
would
not
notice
her
then
she
will
not
accept
their
notice
now
where
was
the
old
man
her
father
all
this
time
said
lewis
was
he
alive
and
in
good
circumstances
certainly
said
walter
and
once
in
awhile
he
threw
her
a
dollar
just
as
one
would
throw
a
bone
to
a
hungry
dog
with
a
by
jove
exclaimed
lewis
as
he
passed
out
what
a
heartless
set

ruth
returned
from
her
daily
walk
to
the
post
office
one
morning
with
a
bundle
of
letters
among
which
was
one
from
walter
its
contents
were
as
follows
dear
sister
ruth
i
wonder
if
you
are
enjoying
your
triumph
half
as
much
as
i
but
how
should
you
since
you
do
not
know
of
it
your
publishers
inform
me
that
orders
are
pouring
in
for
your
book
faster
than
they
can
supply
them
what
do
you
think
of
that
you
have
made
a
decided
hit
how
lucky
that
you
had
the
foresight
to
hold
on
to
your
copyright
will
not
be
a
circumstance
to
the
little
fortune
you
are
going
to
make
your
success
is
glorious
but
i
do
believe
you
are
half
as
proud
of
it
as
i
am
and
now
i
know
of
what
you
are
thinking
as
well
as
if
i
were
by
your
side
is
of
the
little
exile
is
of
katy
you
would
fly
directly
to
bring
her
home
can
i
be
of
any
service
to
you
in
doing
this
business
takes
me
your
way
day
after
can
you
curb
your
impatience
to
see
her
till
then
if
so
i
will
accompany
you
please
write
me
immediately
yours
truly
john
walter
i
send
you
a
batch
of
letters
which
came
by
this
mail
directed
to
office
of
the
household
messenger
ruth
tossed
the
batch
of
letters
down
unopened
and
sprang
to
her
feet
she
tossed
up
nettie
she
kissed
the
astonished
child
till
she
was
half
strangled
she
laughed
she
cried
and
then
she
sat
down
with
her
forehead
in
both
her
hands
for
a
prolonged
reverie
what
news
about
the
book
how
could
she
wait
two
days
before
she
brought
back
katy
and
yet
it
would
be
a
happy
thing
that
walter
whose
name
was
synonymous
with
good
tidings
should
be
associated
with
her
in
the
return
of
the
child
yes
she
would
wait
and
when
katy
secured
what
then
why
she
would
leave
forever
a
city
fraught
with
such
painful
associations
she
would
make
her
a
new
home
home
her
heart
leaped
comforts
for
nettie
and
katy
clothes
food
earned
by
her
own
hands
tears
trickled
through
ruth
fingers
and
her
heart
went
out
in
a
murmured
prayer
to
the
god
of
the
widow
and
fatherless
may
i
play
house
with
these
said
nettie
touching
ruth
elbow
and
pointing
to
the
unopened
letters
no
little
puss
said
ruth
not
yet
wait
a
bit
till
i
have
glanced
at
them
and
she
broke
the
seal
of
one
it
was
an
offer
of
marriage
from
a
widower
he
had
read
an
article
of
hers
on
and
was
very
sure
that
a
woman
with
views
could
not
fail
to
make
a
good
mother
for
his
children
he
was
every
man
who
had
written
her
a
good
disposition
would
love
her
just
as
well
as
if
he
had
never
bent
an
adoring
knee
to
dorrance
no
was
not
at
all
set
in
his
ways
in
fact
preferred
she
should
in
everything
save
him
the
trouble
of
would
live
in
any
part
of
the
union
she
desired
provided
she
would
only
consent
to
these
last
two
words
dorrance
had
italicised
as
indicating
probably
that
he
considered
it
a
pun
fit
even
for
the
critical
eye
of
an
authoress
oh
pshaw
said
ruth
throwing
the
letter
to
nettie
make
anything
you
like
of
it
pussy
it
is
of
no
value
to
me
the
next
letter
ran
as
follows

i
have
the
honor
to
be
guardian
to
a
young
southern
lady
an
orphan
of
large
fortune
who

just
completed
her
education
she
has
taken
a
suite
of
apartments
and
given
me
orders
to
furnish
them
without
regard
to
expense
according
to
her
fancy
i
have
directions
to
procure
busts
of
hemans

landon
and
several
other
distinguished
female
writers

not
the
pleasure
madam
of
knowing
your
true
name
with
whose
writings
she
has
become
familiar
and
who

as
great
a
favorite
with

with
the
multitude
who
have
paid
tribute
to
her
genius
please
send
me
a
line

my
ward

carried
out
yours
truly
thomas
pearce
ruth
glanced
around
her
little
dark
room
and
smiled
i
would
rather
instead
that
an
artist
would
take
a
sketch
of
my
room
now
said
she
that
little
black
stove
where
i
have
so
often
tried
in
vain
to
thaw
my
frozen
fingers
that
rickety
old
bed
the
old
deal
table
with
its
yellow
bowl
of
milk
that
carpet
those
chairs
and
then
you
my
little
bright
fairy
in
the
foreground
and
she
pushed
back
the
soft
glossy
curls
from
nettie
fair
brow
no
no
said
ruth
better
reserve
the
niche
destined
for
for
some
writer
to
whom
ambition
is
not
the
hollow
thing
it
is
to
me
well
what
have
we
here
another
letter
ruth
broke
the
seal
of
letter
no
and
read
dear
madam
i
am
a
poor
devil
and
worse
editor
nevertheless
i
have
started
a
paper
if
you
will
but
allow
me
to
put
your
name
on
it
as
assistant
editress
i
am
sure
it
will
go
like
a
locomotive
if
in
addition
to
this
little
favor
you
could
also
advance
me
the
sum
of
one
hundred
dollars
it
would
be
an
immense
relief
to
your
admirer
john
staples
be
sure
you
direct
to
john
staples
as
there
is
another
john
staples
in
this
place
who
is
a
great
rascal
well
exclaimed
ruth
i
did
not
believe
i
should
ever
be
astonished
again
but
then
i
had
not
heard
from
mr
staples
but
here
is
another
letter
let
us
see
what
the
contents
of
no
are
letter
no
ran
as
follows
dear
i
am
a
better
son
a
better
brother
a
better
husband
and
a
better
father
than
i
was
before
i
commenced
reading
your
articles
may
god
bless
you
for
the
words
you
have
spoken
though
unintentionally
so
directly
to
me
may
you
be
rewarded
by
him
to
whom
the
secrets
of
all
hearts
are
known
your
grateful
friend
this
will
repay
many
a
weary
hour
said
ruth
as
her
tears
fell
upon
the
page
chapter
lxxxi
the
rain
had
poured
down
without
mitigation
for
seven
consecutive
days
the
roads
were
in
a
very
state
dissevered
branches
of
trees
lay
scattered
upon
the
ground
tubs
and
hogsheads
which
careful
housewives
had
placed
under
dripping
spouts
were
full
to
overflowing
the
soaked
hides
of
the
cattle
looked
sleek
as
their
owners
heads
of
a
sunday
the
old
hen
stood
poised
on
one
leg
at
the
till
even
her
patience
had
given
out
the
farmers
had
mended
all
the
old
hoe
and
rake
handles
read
the
almanac
through
and
through
and
worn
all
the
newspapers
and
village
topics
threadbare
when
the
welcome
sun
at
last
broke
through
the
clouds
and
every
little
and
big
puddle
in
the
road
hastened
joyfully
to
reflect
his
beams
old
doctor
hall
started
down
cellar
for
his
eleven
mug
of
cider
to
his
dismay
he
found
his
slippered
pedestals
immersed
in
water
which
had
risen
above
the
last
step
of
the
a
pretty
piece
of
work
this
rain

made
mis
hall
said
the
doctor
stamping
his
wet
feet
and
blowing
his
nose
as
he
returned
from
his
visit
to
the
lower
regions
the
water
has
overflowed
the
cellar
and

noticing
the
doctor
taunt
ruth
interfering
between
me
and
katy
if
you
will
order
her
out
of
the
house
i
will
be
obliged
to
you
i
put
up
with
enough
of
this
meddling
and
it
is
the
last
time
she
shall
cross
this
threshold
you
never
spoke
a
truer
word
said
ruth
and
my
child
shall
cross
it
for
the
last
time
with
me
humph
said
the
doctor
and
you
no
better
than
a
beggar
the
law
says
if
the
mother
ca
support
her
children
the
shall
do
it
the
mother
the
mother
said
ruth
i
have
already
earned
enough
for
their
support
well
if
you
have
which
i
doubt
i
hope
earned
it
said
the
old
lady
ruth
heightened
color
was
the
only
reply
to
this
taunt
tying
her
handkerchief
over
katy
bare
head
and
wrapping
the
trembling
child
in
a
shawl
she
had
provided
she
bore
her
to
a
carriage
where
walter
and
his
grey
with
little
nettie
awaited
them
the
door
was
quickly
closed
and
the
carriage
whirled
off
the
two
gentlemen
alternately
wiped
their
eyes
and
looked
out
the
window
as
katy
trembling
crying
and
laughing
clung
first
to
her
mother
and
then
to
little
nettie
casting
anxious
frightened
glances
toward
the
prison
she
had
left
as
the
carriage
receded
weeping
seemed
to
be
infectious
ruth
cried
and
laughed
and
grey
and
walter
seemed
both
to
have
lost
the
power
of
speech
little
nettie
was
the
first
to
break
the
spell
by
offering
to
lend
katy
her
bonnet
we
will
do
better
than
that
said
ruth
smiling
through
her
tears
we
will
get
one
for
katy
when
we
stop
see
here
katy
and
ruth
tossed
a
purse
full
of
money
into
katy
lap
you
know
mother
said
she
would
come
for
you
as
soon
as
she
earned
the
money
yes
and
i
you
would
mother
but
it
was
so
very
and
the
child
lips
began
to
quiver
again
she
is
so
excited
poor
thing
said
ruth
drawing
her
to
her
bosom
do
talk
about
it
now
katy
lean
your
head
on
me
and
take
a
nice
nap
and
the
weary
child
nestled
up
to
her
mother
while
nettie
put
one
finger
on
her
lip
with
a
sagacious
look
at
walter
as
much
as
to
say
will
keep
still
if
will
she
does
not
resemble
you
as
much
as
nettie
does
said
grey
to
ruth
in
a
whisper
she
is
like
her
father
said
ruth
the
resemblance
is
quite
startling
when
she
is
sleeping
the
same
breadth
of
forehead
the
same
straight
nose
and
full
lips
yes
it
has
often
been
a
great
solace
to
me
said
ruth
after
a
pause
to
sit
at
katy
bedside
and
aid
memory
by
gazing
at
features
which
recalled
so
vividly
the
loved
and
lost
and
she
kissed
the
little
nestler
nettie
said
walter
is
ruth
in
face
form
and
feature
i
wish
the
resemblance
ended
there
whispered
ruth
with
a
sigh
these
dawns
too
often
foreshadow
the
chapter
lxxxii
an
hour
after
the
conversation
narrated
in
the
last
chapter
the
driver
stopped
at
a
hotel
this
is
the
place
then
where
you
are
going
to
stay
for
a
few
weeks
before
you
leave
this
part
of
the
country
for
said
walter
allow
me
to
speak
for
a
dinner
for
us
all
such
a
day
as
this
does
not
dawn
on
us
often
in
this
world
and
he
glanced
affectionately
at
little
katy
the
party
was
soon
seated
round
a
table
nettie
stopped
at
every
other
mouthful
to
look
into
katy
eyes
or
to
kiss
her
while
little
katy
gazed
about
bewilderingly
and
grasped
her
mother
hand
tightly
whenever
her
ear
caught
the
sound
of
a
strange
voice
or
footstep
will
you
have
some
soup
little
puss
said
walter
after
they
were
seated
at
the
table
pulling
one
of
nettie
long
curls
ask
my
mother
replied
the
child
with
a
quizzical
look
she
the
walter
threw
up
his
hands
and
a
general
shout
followed
this
precocious
sally
come
come
said
walter
when
he
had
done
laughing
you
have
begun
too
early
little
puss
come
here
and
let
me
feel
your
head
i
must
take
a
phrenological
look
at
you
bless
me
what
an
affectionate
little
creature
you
must
be
said
he
passing
his
hand
over
her
head
stick
a
pin
there
now
while
i
examine
the
rest
of
your
bumps
you
must
not
stick
a
pin
in
my
head
said
nettie
i
do
like
that
way
of
expressing
an
no
further
examination
is
necessary
said
the
extinguished
walter
i
have
done
with
miss
nettie
what
do
you
mean
whispered
he
to
ruth
by
having
such
a
child
as
that
are
we
going
to
have
another
genius
in
the
family
i
do
know
about
that
said
ruth
laughing
she
often
says
such
things
when
she
gets
excited
and
hilarious
but
i
never
encourage
it
by
notice
and
you
must
not
my
physician
told
me
not
to
teach
her
anything
and
by
all
means
not
to
let
her
see
the
inside
of
a
schoolroom
at
present
well
well
said
walter
miss
nettie
and
i
must
have
a
tilt
at
punning
some
day
you
had
better
engage
ruth
to
furnish
the
knickerbocker
with
smart
repartees
for
his
table
from
your
own
fireside
whispered
ruth
do
spoil
her
such
a
child
needs
careful
training
she
is
and
sensitive
and
ruth
sighed
i
interpret
your
thoughts
said
walter
but
we
must
have
no
backward
glances
those
children
will
never
suffer
what
you
have
suffered
few
women
ever
did
ruth
for
the
thousandth
time
i
tell
you
you
are
a
brave
woman
upon
my
word
said
walter
suddenly
blushing
and
thrusting
his
hand
in
his
pocket
i
have
committed
the
sin
so
common
to
all
carried
letters
for
you
round
in
my
pocket
all
this
time
without
delivering
them
here
they
are
i
never
saw
a
woman
have
so
many
letters
as
you
do
you
need
a
private
secretary
before
long
ruth
broke
the
seal
of
one
saying
you
excuse
me
a
few
moments
and
read
to
dear
madam
we
have
established
a
very
successful
infant
school
in
our
neighborhood
numbering
about
fifty
pupils
our
first
anniversary
occurs
next
month
it
is
our
intention
to
gather
together
the
parents
and
children
and
have
a
sort
of
jubilee
hymns
will
be
sung
and
short
pieces
spoken
we
should
be
very
much
obliged
to
you
if
you
would
write
us
a
little
dialogue
to
be
repeated
by
two
little
girls
of
the
age
of
six
something
sweet
and
simple
such
as
you
know
how
to
write
we
make
no
apology
for
thus
intruding
on
your
time
because
we
know
your
heart
is
with
the
children
yours
respectfully
john

gentlemen
while
i
read
no
said
ruth
no
ran
as
follows
dear
old
guardy
has
sent
me
up
to
this
academy
i
hate
academies
i
hate
guardy
i
hate
everything
but
snipe
shooting
and
boating
just
now
i
am
in
a
horrid
fix
every
fellow
in
this
academy
has
to
write
a
composition
once
a
week
i
can
not
do
it
i
never
could
my
talents
do
lie
in
that
way
i
do
know
where
they
do
lie
what
i
want
of
you
is
to
write
those
compositions
for
me
you
can
do
it
just
as
easy
as
water
runs
down
hill
you
could
scratch
one
off
while
i
am
nibbing
my
pen
old
phillips
will
think
they
are
uncommon
smart
for
me
but
never
mind
i
shall
keep
dark
and
you
are
such
a
good
soul
i
know
you
ca
refuse
my
cigars
have
been
out
two
whole
days
so
you
may
know
that
i
have
no
funds
else
i
would
send
you
a
present
yours
truly
hal
hunnewell
after
glancing
over
this
letter
ruth
broke
into
a
merry
laugh
and
saying
this
is
too
good
to
keep
read
it
aloud
for
the
amusement
of
the
company
who
unanimously
voted
hal
hunnewell
a
composition
every
week
for
his
precocious
impudence
come
now
said
walter
as
ruth
took
up
no
if
you
have
another
of
the
same
sort
let
us
hear
it
unless
it
be
of
a
confidential
nature
ruth
looked
over
the
letter
a
moment
and
then
read
dear
mamma
has
read
me
some
of
your
stories
i
like
them
very
much
you
say
you
love
little
children
do
you
think
we
got
a
bran
new
baby
it
came
last
night
when
i
was
asleep
in
my
it
is
a
little
pink
baby
mamma
says
it
will
grow
white
it
has
got
such
funny
little
fingers
they
look
all
wrinkled
just
like
our
maid
when
she
has
been
at
the
mother
has
to
stay
in
bed
with
him
to
keep
him
warm
he
such
a
little
cold
shaky
thing
he
has
a
bit
of
hair
and
he
scowls
like
everything
but
i
guess
he
be
pretty
anyhow
i
love
him
i
asked
mother
if
i
might
not
write
and
tell
you
about
him
and
she
laughed
and
said
i
do
know
who
is
nor
where
she
lives
but
uncle
jack
he
gives
me
lots
of
candy
and
dolls
said
that
i
must
send
it
to
publishers
i
do
know
what
a
publisher
is
and
so
i
told
uncle
jack
and
he
laughed
and
said
he
would
lose
guess
if
i
did
have
something
to
do
with
them
one
of
these
days
i
do
know
what
that
meant
either
and
when
i
asked
him
he
said
away
puss
i
think
it
is
very
nice
to
have
an
uncle
jack
at
christmas
and
new
year
but
other
times
they
only
plague
little
children
i
wish
i
could
see
you
how
do
you
look
i
guess
you
look
like
mamma
mamma
has
got
blue
eyes
and
soft
brown
hair
and
her
mouth
looks
very
pleasant
when
she
smiles
mamma
voice
is
as
sweet
as
a
robin
so
papa
says
papa
is
a
great
big
man
so
big
that
nobody
could
ever
hurt
me
or
mamma
papa
wants
to
see
you
too
wo
you
write
me
a
letter
a
little
letter
all
to
myself
i
got
a
box
made
of
rosewood
with
a
lock
and
key
on
it
where
i
hide
it
from
uncle
jack
that
would
tease
him
uncle
jack
wants
to
see
you
too
but
i
hope
you
never
will
let
him
for
he
such
a
terrible
tease
he
plague
you
dreadfully
i
guess
our
baby
would
send
his
love
to
you
if
he
only
knew
you
please
write
me
soon
and
send
it
to
kitty
mills
care
of
uncle
jack
mills
and
please
seal
it
up
all
tight
so
he
can
not
peep
into
it
i
want
you
to
write
a
book
of
stories
for
little
girls
and
do
make
them
end
bad
because
it
makes
me
cry
nor
put
any
ghosts
in
them
because
it
scares
me
or
have
any
down
at
the
bottom
because
uncle
jack
always
asks
me
if
i
skipped
it
write
something
funny
wo
you
i
like
funny
things
and
fairy
stories
oh
i
like
fairy
stories
so
was
it
nice
about
the
mice
and
the
pumpkin
in
cinderella
make
them
all
end
well
wo
you
your
affectionate
little
kitty
i
suppose
you
do
not
feel
any
curiosity
to
know
what
the
papers
say
about
your
book
said
walter
as
ruth
refolded
her
letters
i
have
quite
a
stock
of
notices
in
my
pocket
which
i
have
saved
up
you
seem
to
have
taken
the
public
heart
by
storm
you
could
not
desire
better
notices
and
the
best
of
it
is
they
are
spontaneous
neither
begged
nor
in
a
measure
demanded
by
a
personal
call
upon
the
editors
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
asked
ruth
look
at
spirit
of
flashing
from
her
eyes
said
grey
laughing
as
he
pointed
at
ruth
i
mean
this
said
walter
that
not
long
since
i
expressed
my
surprise
to
an
able
critic
and
reviewer
that
he
could
praise
a
certain
book
which
he
must
have
known
was
entirely
deficient
in
merit
of
any
kind
his
answer
was
authoress
of
that
book
made
a
call
on
me
at
my
office
deprecated
in
the
strongest
terms
any
adverse
criticism
in
the
paper
with
which
i
am
connected
said
that
other
papers
would
take
their
tone
from
mine
that
it
was
her
first
book
and
that
her
pen
was
her
only
means
of
support
what
can
a
man
do
under
such
circumstances
said
my
informant
how
she
said
ruth
of
what
ultimate
advantage
could
it
be
it
might
have
procured
the
sale
of
a
few
copies
at
first
but
a
book
like
water
will
find
its
level
but
what
astonishes
me
most
of
all
is
that
any
able
reviewer
should
be
willing
to
risk
his
reputation
as
a
critic
by
such
promiscuous
puffery
how
are
the
people
to
know
when
he
speaks
his
sentiments
it
strikes
me
said
ruth
laughing
that
such
a
critic
should
have
some
cabalistic
mark
by
which
the
initiated
may
understand
when
he
speaks
truthfully
it
is
such
a
pity
continued
ruth
thoughtfully
it
so
neutralizes
criticism
it
is
such
a
pity
too
that
an
authoress
could
be
found
so
devoid
of
as
to
do
such
a
thing
it
is
such
an
injury
to
those
women
who
would
disdain
so
to
fetter
criticism
who
would
launch
their
book
like
a
gallant
ship
prepared
for
adverse
gales
not
sneaking
near
the
shore
or
lowering
their
flag
for
fear
of
a
stray
shot
do
you
know
ruth
said
walter
when
i
hear
you
talk
i
no
longer
wonder
at
hyacinth
lack
of
independence
and
common
sense
his
share
must
by
some
unaccountable
mistake
have
been
given
to
you
in
addition
to
your
own
but
where
are
the
children
they
looked
around
katy
and
nettie
taking
advantage
of
this
prolonged
discussion
had
slid
from
the
table
in
company
with
a
plate
of
nuts
and
raisins
and
were
holding
an
animated
conversation
in
a
further
corner
why
what
a
great
big
mark
on
your
arm
katy
exclaimed
nettie
how
it
come
hush
replied
katy
grandma
did
it
she
talked
very
bad
about
mamma
to
grandpa
and
i
started
to
go
up
into
my
little
room
because
you
know
i
bear
to
hear
it
and
she
called
to
me
and
said
what
are
you
leaving
the
room
for
and
you
know
nettie
mamma
teaches
us
always
to
tell
the
truth
so
i
said
i
can
not
bear
to
stay
and
hear
you
say
what
is
not
true
about
my
mamma
and
then
grandma
threw
down
her
knitting
seized
me
by
the
arm
and
set
me
down
oh
hard
on
a
chair
and
said
you
hear
it
then
oh
nettie
i
hear
it
so
i
put
my
fingers
in
both
ears
and
then
she
beat
me
and
left
that
place
on
my
arm
and
held
both
my
hands
while
she
made
me
listen
during
this
recital
nettie
eyes
glowed
like
living
coals
when
katy
concluded
she
clenched
her
little
fists
and
said
katy
why
did
you
strike
her
katy
shook
her
head
and
said
in
a
low
tone
oh
nettie
she
would
have
killed
me
when
she
got
angry
she
looked
just
like
that
picture
of
satan
we
saw
once
in
the
shop
window
katy
i
do
something
to
her
said
nettie
closing
her
teeth
together
and
planting
her
tiny
foot
firmly
upon
the
floor
she
talk
so
about
mamma
oh
if
i
was
only
a
big
woman
i
suppose
we
must
her
said
katy
thoughtfully
wo
said
the
impulsive
little
nettie
never
never
never
then
you
can
not
say
your
prayers
said
the
wise
little
katy
us
as
we
forgive
those
who
have
trespassed
against
us
what
a
pity
exclaimed
the
orthodox
nettie
do
you
wish
that
had
been
put
in
what
we
do
katy
nettie
said
her
mother
who
had
approached
unnoticed
what
did
you
mean
when
you
said
just
now
that
you
wished
you
were
a
big
woman
nettie
hung
her
head
for
a
minute
and
twisted
the
corner
of
her
apron
irresolutely
at
last
she
replied
with
a
sudden
effort
you
wo
love
me
mamma
but
i
will
tell
you
i
wanted
to
cut
grandma
head
off
little
katy
laughed
outright
as
the
idea
of
this
lilliputian
combatant
presented
itself
ruth
looked
serious
that
is
not
right
nettie
said
she
your
grandmother
is
an
unhappy
miserable
old
woman
she
has
punished
herself
worse
than
anybody
else
could
punish
her
she
is
more
miserable
than
ever
now
because
i
have
earned
money
to
support
you
and
katy
she
have
made
us
all
love
her
and
help
to
make
her
old
age
cheerful
but
now
unless
she
repents
she
will
live
miserably
and
die
forsaken
for
nobody
can
love
her
with
such
a
temper
this
is
a
dreadful
old
age
nettie
i
i
forgive
her
said
nettie
jumping
into
her
lap
but
i
hope
i
sha
ever
hear
her
say
anything
against
you
mother
i
glad
i
was
katy
did
you
ever
wish
katy
that
she
might
fall
down
stairs
and
break
her
neck
or
catch
a
fever
or
something
oh
mother
what
a
funny
girl
nettie
is
said
katy
laughing
till
the
tears
came
i
had
almost
forgotten
her
queer
ways
oh
how
grandmother
have
boxed
your
ears
nettie
the
incorrigible
nettie
cut
one
of
her
pirouettes
across
the
room
and
snapped
her
fingers
by
way
of
answer
to
this
assertion
while
ruth
and
her
children
were
conversing
the
two
gentlemen
were
quite
as
absorbed
in
another
corner
of
the
apartment
it
astonishes
me
said
grey
to
walter
that
should
be
so
little
elated
by
her
wonderful
success
it
will
cease
to
do
so
when
you
know
her
better
said
walter
the
map
of
life
has
been
spread
out
before
her
she
has
stood
singing
on
its
breezy
heights
she
has
lain
weeping
in
its
gloomy
valleys
flowers
have
strewn
her
pathway
and
thorns
have
pierced
her
tender
feet
the
clusters
of
the
promised
land
have
moistened
her
laughing
lip
the
dead
sea
apple
has
mocked
her
wasted
fingers
rainbows
have
spanned
her
sky
like
a
glory
and
storms
have
beat
pitilessly
on
her
defenceless
head
eyes
have
beamed
upon
her
smiling
welcome
when
wounded
and
smitten
she
fainted
by
the
way
the
priest
and
the
levite
have
passed
by
on
the
other
side
knows
every
phase
of
the
human
heart
she
knows
that
she
was
none
the
less
worthy
because
poor
and
unrecognized
she
knows
how
much
of
the
homage
now
paid
her
is
due
to
the
of
the
gem
therefore
she
takes
all
these
things
at
their
true
valuation
then
my
friend
and
walter
voice
became
tremulous
amid
all
these
done
plaudits
loved
voice
is
the
laurel
crown
indeed
is
won
but
the
feet
at
which
she
fain
would
cast
it
have
finished
their
toilsome
it
is
time
we
gentlemen
were
going
let
us
talk
business
now
said
walter
as
ruth
returned
from
her
conversation
with
the
children
how
long
did
you
propose
remaining
here
ruth
for
a
month
or
so
she
replied
i
have
several
matters
i
wish
to
arrange
before
bidding
adieu
to
this
part
of
the
country
i
shall
try
to
get
through
as
soon
as
possible
for
i
long
to
be
settled
in
a
permanent
and
comfortable
home
i
shall
return
this
way
in
a
month
or
six
weeks
said
walter
and
if
you
are
ready
at
that
time
i
shall
be
most
happy
to
escort
you
and
your
children
to
your
new
residence
thank
you
said
ruth
shouted
both
the
children
as
the
two
gentlemen
left
the
room
chapter
lxxxiii
i
do
know
about
holding
you
in
my
lap
at
once
said
ruth
smiling
as
nettie
climbed
up
after
katy
do
please
said
nettie
and
now
let
us
have
a
nice
talk
tell
us
where
we
are
going
to
live
mamma
and
if
we
can
have
a
kitty
or
a
rabbit
or
some
live
thing
to
play
with
and
if
we
are
going
to
school
and
if
you
are
going
to
leave
off
writing
now
and
play
with
katy
and
me
and
go
to
walk
with
us
and
ride
with
us
sha
we
have
some
rides
what
is
the
matter
mamma
said
the
little
chatterbox
noticing
a
tear
in
her
mother
eye
i
was
thinking
dear
how
happy
we
are
is
that
funny
said
nettie
to
katy
that
mamma
should
cry
when
she
is
happy
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
do
cry
when
i
happy
did
we
have
a
good
dinner
katy
oh
i
like
this
house
it
was
such
an
old
dark
room
we
used
to
live
in
and
there
was
nothing
pretty
to
look
at
and
mamma
kept
on
writing
and
i
had
nothing
to
play
with
except
a
little
mouse
who
used
to
peep
out
of
his
hole
when
it
came
dark
for
some
supper
i
liked
him
he
was
so
cunning
but
i
give
him
any
supper
because
here
the
little
chatterbox
glanced
at
her
mother
and
then
placing
her
mouth
to
katy
ear
whispered
with
a
look
the
gravity
of
which
was
irresistible
because
mamma
support
a
mouse
ruth
laughed
heartily
as
she
overheard
the
remark
and
nettie
thought
her
mother
more
of
a
puzzle
than
ever
that
she
should
keep
laughing
and
crying
so
in
the
wrong
place
what
have
you
there
nettie
asked
katy
something
said
nettie
looking
very
wise
as
she
hid
her
chubby
hands
under
her
pinafore
it
is
a
secret
mamma
and
i
know
said
she
with
a
very
important
air
do
we
mamma
would
you
tell
katy
mother
if
you
were
me
certainly
said
ruth
you
know
it
would
not
be
pleasant
to
keep
such
a
great
secret
from
katy
nettie
looked
very
searchingly
into
her
mother
eyes
but
she
saw
nothing
there
but
sincerity
wo
you
tell
katy
ever
it
is
a
terrible
secret
no
replied
katy
laughing
not
even
to
mr
walter
asked
nettie
who
had
learned
to
consider
walter
as
their
best
friend
and
the
impersonation
of
all
that
was
manly
and
chivalrous
katy
shook
her
head
negatively
well
then
said
nettie
hanging
her
head
with
a
pretty
shame
in
love
katy
burst
into
an
uncontrollable
fit
of
laughter
rocking
herself
to
and
fro
and
ejaculating
oh
mamma
oh
did
you
ever
oh
how
funny
funny
said
nettie
with
the
greatest
naîvete
it
was
funny
at
all
it
was
very
nice
i
tell
you
all
how
it
happened
katy
you
see
i
used
to
get
so
tired
when
you
were
away
when
i
had
nobody
to
play
with
and
mamma
kept
up
such
a
thinking
so
mamma
said
i
might
go
to
a
little
free
school
opposite
when
i
felt
like
it
and
perhaps
that
would
amuse
me
mamma
told
the
teacher
not
to
trouble
herself
about
teaching
me
much
well
i
sat
on
a
little
low
bench
and
right
opposite
me
across
the
room
was
such
a
little
boy
his
name
was
neddy
he
had
on
a
blue
jacket
with
twelve
bright
buttons
on
it
i
counted
them
and
little
plaid
pants
and
drab
gaiters
and
his
cheeks
were
so
rosy
and
his
hair
so
curly
and
his
eyes
so
bright
oh
katy
and
nettie
clasped
her
little
hands
together
in
a
paroxysm
of
admiration
well
katy
he
kept
smiling
at
me
and
in
recess
he
used
to
give
me
half
his
apple
and
once
when
nobody
was
looking
you
tell
her
mamma
said
nettie
doubtfully
as
she
ran
up
to
her
mother
wo
you
tell
now
katy
certainly
again
asked
nettie
no
promised
katy
not
even
to
mr
walter
no
well
once
when
the
teacher
was
looking
katy
he
took
a
piece
of
chalk
and
wrote
on
the
palm
of
his
hand
and
held
it
up
to
me
and
then
kissed
it
and
nettie
hid
her
glowing
face
on
katy
neck
whispering
was
it
beautiful
katy
yes
replied
katy
trying
to
keep
from
laughing
well
said
nettie
i
felt
most
ashamed
to
tell
mamma
i
do
know
why
though
i
believe
i
was
afraid
that
she
would
call
it
or
something
and
i
felt
just
as
if
i
should
cry
if
she
did
but
katy
she
did
not
think
it
silly
a
bit
she
said
it
was
beautiful
to
be
loved
and
that
it
made
everything
on
earth
look
brighter
and
that
she
was
glad
little
neddy
loved
me
and
that
i
might
love
him
just
as
much
as
ever
i
liked
just
the
same
as
if
he
were
a
little
girl
was
nice
asked
nettie
i
always
mean
to
tell
mamma
everything
do
you
katy
but
you
have
not
told
katy
yet
what
you
have
hidden
under
your
apron
there
said
ruth
sure
enough
said
nettie
producing
a
little
picture
well
neddy
whispered
to
me
one
day
in
recess
that
he
had
drawn
a
pretty
picture
on
purpose
for
me
and
that
he
was
going
to
have
a
lottery
i
do
know
what
a
lottery
is
but
he
cut
a
great
many
slips
of
paper
some
long
and
some
short
and
the
one
who
got
the
longest
was
to
have
the
picture
then
he
put
a
little
tiny
mark
on
the
end
of
the
longest
so
that
i
should
know
it
and
then
i
got
the
picture
you
know
why
did
he
take
all
that
trouble
asked
the
practical
katy
why
did
he
give
it
to
you
right
out
if
he
wanted
to
because
because
said
nettie
twirling
her
thumbs
and
blushing
with
a
little
feminine
shame
at
her
want
of
independence
he
said
he
was
afraid
the
boys
would
laugh
at
him
if
they
found
it
out
well
then
i
would
have
taken
it
if
i
had
been
you
said
the
phlegmatic
katy
but
you
know
i
him
so
said
nettie
naîvely
chapter
lxxxiv
days
and
weeks
flew
by
katy
and
nettie
were
never
weary
of
comparing
notes
and
relating
experiences
nettie
thought
gloomy
attics
scant
fare
and
cross
landladies
the
climax
of
misery
and
katy
considered
a
score
of
with
nettie
and
a
loving
mother
at
one
end
and
herself
and
a
cross
grandmother
at
the
other
infinitely
worse
why
you
ca
tell
anything
about
it
said
katy
grandma
took
away
a
little
kitty
because
i
loved
it
and
burned
up
a
mamma
brought
me
and
tore
up
a
letter
which
mamma
printed
in
big
capitals
on
a
piece
of
paper
for
me
to
read
when
i
was
lonesome
and
she
let
me
feed
the
little
when
they
came
shivering
round
the
door
and
she
made
me
eat
turnips
when
they
made
me
sick
and
she
said
i
must
not
run
when
i
went
to
school
for
fear
it
would
wear
my
shoes
out
and
she
put
me
to
bed
early
and
i
used
to
lie
and
count
the
stars
i
liked
the
seven
little
stars
all
cuddled
up
together
best
and
sometimes
i
looked
at
the
moon
and
thought
i
saw
faces
and
mountains
in
it
and
i
wondered
if
it
was
shining
into
mamma
window
and
then
i
thought
of
you
all
snug
in
mamma
bed
and
then
i
cried
and
cried
and
got
up
and
looked
out
into
the
road
and
wondered
if
i
could
not
run
away
in
the
night
when
grandmother
was
asleep
oh
nettie
she
was
a
grandmother
she
tried
to
make
me
stop
loving
mother
she
told
me
that
she
loved
you
better
than
she
did
me
and
then
i
wanted
to
die
i
thought
of
it
every
night
i
knew
it
was
not
true
but
it
kept
troubling
me
and
then
she
said
that
very
likely
mamma
would
go
off
somewhere
without
letting
me
know
anything
about
it
and
never
see
me
again
and
she
always
said
such
things
just
as
i
was
going
to
bed
and
then
you
know
i
could
not
get
to
sleep
till
almost
morning
and
when
i
did
i
dreamed
such
dreadful
dreams
you
poor
little
thing
exclaimed
nettie
with
patronizing
sympathy
to
her
elder
sister
and
laying
her
cheek
against
hers
you
poor
little
thing
well
mamma
and
i
had
a
horrid
time
too
you
imagine
the
wind
blew
into
the
cracks
of
the
room
cold
and
the
stove
smoked
and
i
was
afraid
to
eat
when
we
any
supper
for
fear
mamma
would
not
have
enough
she
always
said
am
not
hungry
dear
but
i
think
she
did
it
to
make
me
eat
more
and
one
night
mamma
had
no
money
to
buy
candles
and
she
wrote
by
moonlight
and
i
often
heard
her
cry
when
she
thought
i
was
asleep
and
i
was
so
afraid
of
mamma
landladies
they
screamed
so
loud
and
scowled
at
me
so
and
the
grocer
boy
made
faces
at
me
when
i
went
in
for
a
loaf
of
bread
and
said
ai
we
a
fine
lady
aint
we
and
the
wheel
was
off
my
old
tin
cart
and
oh
dear
katy
and
nettie
little
voice
grew
fainter
and
fainter
and
the
little
chatterbox
and
her
listener
both
fell
asleep
ruth
as
she
listened
in
the
shadow
of
the
further
corner
thanked
god
that
they
who
had
had
so
brief
an
acquaintance
with
life
joys
so
early
an
introduction
to
life
cares
were
again
blithe
free
and
joyous
as
childhood
ever
should
be
how
sweet
to
have
it
in
her
power
to
hedge
them
in
with
comforts
to
surround
them
with
pleasures
to
make
up
to
them
for
every
tear
of
sorrow
they
had
shed
to
repay
them
for
the
mute
glance
of
sympathy
the
silent
caress
given
they
scarce
knew
why
but
oh
how
touching
how
priceless
when
her
own
heart
was
breaking
and
there
they
lay
in
their
pretty
little
bed
sleeping
cheek
to
cheek
with
arms
thrown
around
each
other
nettie
courageous
impulsive
independent
irrepressible
but
loving
generous
sensitive
and
katy
with
veins
through
which
the
flowed
more
evenly
thoughtful
discriminating
diffident
reserved
so
proud
of
those
magnetic
qualities
in
her
little
sister
in
which
she
was
lacking
as
to
do
injustice
to
her
own
solid
but
less
showy
traits
needing
ever
the
kind
word
of
encouragement
and
judicious
praise
to
stimulate
into
life
the
dormant
seeds
of
ruth
kissed
them
both
and
left
their
future
with
him
who
doeth
all
things
well
twelve
at
night
ruth
lies
dreaming
by
the
side
of
her
children
she
dreams
that
she
roves
with
them
through
lovely
gardens
odorous
with
sweets
she
plucks
for
their
parched
lips
the
luscious
fruits
she
garlands
them
with
flowers
and
smiles
in
her
sleep
as
their
beaming
eyes
sparkle
and
the
rosy
flush
of
happiness
mantles
their
cheeks
but
look
there
are
three
of
them
another
has
joined
the
band
a
little
shadowy
form
with
lambent
eyes
and
the
smile
of
a
seraph
blessed
little
trio
follows
another
he
has
the
same
shadowy
outline
the
same
sweet
holy
yet
familiar
eyes
ruth
face
grows
radiant
the
broken
links
are
gathered
up
the
family
circle
is
complete
with
the
sudden
revulsion
of
the
scene
changes
she
dreams
that
the
cry
of
fire
fire
resounds
through
the
streets
bells
ring
dogs
howl
watchmen
spring
their
rattles
boys
shout
men
whoop
and
halloo
as
they
drag
the
engine
over
the
stony
pavements
fire
fire
through
street
after
street
she
dreams
the
flies
windows
are
thrown
up
and
many
a
head
is
thrust
hastily
out
and
as
hastily
withdrawn
when
satisfied
of
the
distant
danger
still
on
rush
the
crowd
the
heavens
are
one
broad
glare
and
still
the
wreathed
smoke
curls
over
the
distant
houses
from
the
doors
and
windows
of
the
doomed
building
the
forked
flame
fanned
by
the
fury
of
the
wind
darts
out
its
thousand
fiery
tongues
women
with
dishevelled
locks
and
vestments
rush
franticly
out
bearing
in
their
tightened
clasp
the
sick
maimed
and
helpless
while
the
noble
firemen
heedless
of
risk
and
danger
plunge
fearlessly
into
the
heated
air
of
the
burning
building
now
ruth
moves
uneasily
on
her
pillow
she
becomes
conscious
of
a
stifling
choking
sensation
she
slowly
opens
her
eyes
god
in
heaven
it
is
not
all
a
dream
with
a
wild
shriek
she
springs
from
the
bed
and
snatching

strange
we
do
not
hear
from
john
said
millet
to
her
wooden
husband
as
he
sat
leisurely
sipping
his
last
cup
of
tea
and
chewing
the
cud
of
his
reflections
i
want
to
hear
how
he
gets
on
whether
he
is
likely
to
get
any
practice
and
if
his
office
is
located
to
suit
him
i
hope
hyacinth
will
speak
a
good
word
for
him
it
is
very
hard
for
a
young
man
in
a
strange
place
to
get
employment
i
really
pity
john
it
must
be
so
disagreeable
to
put
up
with
the
initiatory
humiliations
of
a
young
physician
without
fortune
in
a
great
city
ca
he
go
round
and
ask
people
to
give
him
work
just
like
cousin
ruth
asked
a
sharp
little
millet
who
was
playing
marbles
in
the
corner
it
is
time
you
were
in
bed
willy
said
his
disconcerted
mother
as
she
pointed
to
the
door
go
tell
nancy
to
put
you
to
bed
as
i
was
saying
millet
it
is
very
hard
for
poor
john
he
is
so
sensitive
i
hope
he
has
a
nice
among
refined
people
and
a
pleasant
room
with
everything
comfortable
and
convenient
about
it
he
is
so
fastidious
so
easily
disgusted
with
disagreeable
surroundings
i
hope
he
will
not
get
if
he
gets
practice
i
hope
he
will
not
have
to
to
see
his
patients
he
ought
to
have
a
nice
chaise
and
a
fine
horse
and
some
trusty
little
boy
to
sit
in
the
chaise
and
hold
the
reins
while
he
makes
his
calls
i
hope
he
has
curtains
to
his
windows
and
a
nice
carpet
on
the
floor
and
plenty
of
and
to
read
by
and
a
soft
lounge
to
throw
himself
on
when
he
is
weary
poor
john
i
wonder
why
we
do
not
hear
from
him
suppose
you
write
mr
millet
millet
wiped
his
mouth
on
his
napkin
stroked
his
chin
pushed
back
his
cup
two
degrees
crossed
his
knife
and
fork
transversely
over
his
plate
moved
back
his
chair
two
feet
and
a
half
hemmed
six
consecutive
times
and
was
then
safely
delivered
of
the
following
remark
my
the
overcoat
was
brought
in
from
its
peg
in
the
entry
the
left
pocket
was
disembowelled
and
from
it
was
ferreted
out
a
letter
from
john
warranted
to
keep
which
had
lain
there
unopened
three
days
millet
made
no
remark
that
day
had
gone
by
she
had
ate
drank
and
slept
with
that
petrifaction
too
long
to
be
guilty
of
any
such
nonsense
she
sat
down
with
a
resignation
worthy
of
socrates
and
perused
the
following
epistle
dear
mother
well
my
sign
hangs
out
my
john
millet
and
here
i
sit
day
after
day
waiting
for
patients
i
should
spell
it
this
is
a
great
city
and
there
are
plenty
of
accidents
happening
every
hour
in
the
but
unluckily
for
me
there
are
more
than
plenty
of
doctors
to
attend
to
them
as
every
other
door
has
one
of
their
signs
swinging
out
hyacinth
has
been
sick
and
i
ran
up
there
the
other
day
thinking
as
he
is
a
public
man
it
might
be
some
professional
advantage
to
me
to
have
my
name
mentioned
in
connection
with
his
sickness
he
has
a
splendid
place
six
or
eight
servants
and
everything
on
a
corresponding
scale
to
think
of
ruth
astonishing
success
i
was
in
hopes
it
might
help
me
a
little
in
the
way
of
business
to
say
that
she
was
my
cousin
but
she
has
cut
me
dead
how
could
tell
she
was
going
to
be
so
famous
when
i
requested
her
not
to
allow
her
children
to
call
me
john
in
the
street
i
tell
you
mother
we
all
missed
a
figure
in
turning
the
cold
shoulder
to
her
and
how
much
money
she
has
made
i
might
sit
in
my
office
a
month
and
not
earn
so
much
as
she
can
by
her
pen
in
one
forenoon
yes
there
no
denying
it
we
all
made
a
great
mistake
brother
tom
writes
me
from
college
that
at
a
party
the
other
night
he
happened
to
mention
incidentally
of
course
that
was
his
cousin
when
some
one
near
him
remarked
should
think
the
less
said
about
that
by
relatives
the
better
it
frets
hyacinth
to
a
frenzy
to
have
her
poverty
alluded
to
he
told
me
that
he
had
taken
the
most
incredible
pains
to
conciliate
editors
whom
he
despised
merely
to
prevent
any
allusion
to
it
in
their
columns
i
myself
have
sent
several
anonymous
paragraphs
to
the
papers
for
insertion
contradicting
the
current
reports
and
saying
that
floy
lost
her
before
she
lost
her
friends
i
do
suppose
that
was
quite
right
but
i
must
have
an
eye
to
my
practice
you
know
and
it
might
injure
me
if
the
truth
were
known
i
find
it
very
difficult
too
to
get
any
adverse
paragraph
in
she
is
getting
to
be
such
a
favorite
anywhere
where
it
will
the
little
scurrilous
papers
you
know
have
no
influence
it
is
very
expensive
living
here
i
am
quite
out
of
pocket
if
you
can
get
anything
from
father
i
wish
you
would
hyacinth
says
i
must
marry
a
rich
wife
as
he
did
when
i
get
cornered
by
duns
perhaps
i
may
but
your
rich
girls
are
invariably
homely
and
i
have
an
eye
for
beauty
still
there
no
knowing
what
gilded
pill
i
may
be
tempted
to
swallow
if
i
do
get
into
practice
pretty
soon
hyacinth
wife
makes
too
many
allusions
to
family
to
suit
me
or
hyacinth
either
if
the
truth
must
be
told
but
he
hates
a
dun
worse
so
that
squares
it

suppose

good
afternoon
hall
said
one
of
the
old
lady
neighbors
here
is
the
book
you
lent
me
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
it
i
like
it
better
than
any
book
i
have
read
for
a
long
while
you
said
truly
that
if
i
once
began
it
i
should
not
lay
it
down
till
i
had
finished
it
yes
said
the
old
lady
i
do
often
read
a
book
my
eyes
are
not
very
strong
blue
eyes
seldom
are
i
believe
said
she
fearing
lest
her
visitor
should
suspect
old
time
had
been
blurring
them
but
that
book
now
just
suits
me
there
is
in
it
whoever
wrote
that
book
is
a
good
writer
and
hope
she
will
give
us
another
just
like
it
is
a
queer
name
i
do
recollect
ever
hearing
it
before
i
wonder
who
she
is
so
do
i
said
the
visitor
and
what
is
more
i
mean
to
find
out
oh
here
comes
squire
dana
son
he
knows
everything
i
ask
yes
there
he
comes
into
the
gate
fine
young
man
dana
they
say
he
making
up
to
sarah
jilson
the
lawyer
daughter
good
match
too
good
afternoon
said
both
the
ladies
in
a
breath
glad
to
see
you
dana
folks
well
that
right
we
have
just
been
saying
that
you
could
tell
us
who
the
author
of
that
charming
book
sketches
really
is
you
are
inclined
to
quiz
me
said
dana
i
think
it
should
be
who
should
give
that
information
us
exclaimed
both
the
old
ladies
us
we
have
not
the
slightest
idea
who
she
is
we
only
admire
her
book
well
then
i
have
an
unexpected
pleasure
to
bestow
said
dana
rubbing
his
hands
in
great
glee
allow
me
to
inform
you
hall
that
is
no
more
nor
less
than
your
ruth
screamed
the
old
lady
growing
very
red
in
the
face
and
clearing
her
throat
most
vigorously
i
assure
you
it
is
true
my
informant
is
quite
reliable
i
am
glad
you
admire
your
book
hall
i
quite
share
the
feeling
with
you
but
i
do
admire
it
said
the
old
lady
growing
every
moment
more
confused
there
are
several
things
in
it
now
i
think
of
them
which
i
consider
highly
immoral
i
think
i
mentioned
them
to
you
mrs
spear
said
she
trusting
to
that
lady
defective
memory
at
the
time
i
lent
it
to
you
oh
no
you
did
replied
mrs
spear
you
said
it
was
one
of
the
best
and
most
interesting
books
you
ever
read
else
i
should
not
have
borrowed
it
i
am
very
particular
what
i
put
in
my
children
way
well
i
could
have
been
thinking
of
what
i
was
saying
said
the
old
lady
the
book
is
very
silly
a
great
part
of
it
beside
being
very
bold
for
a
woman
and
as
i
said
before
really
immoral
it
is
highly
recommended
by
the
religious
press
said
dana
infinitely
amused
at
the
old
lady
sudden
change
of
opinion
you
ca
tell
said
the
old
lady
i
have
no
doubt
she
wrote
those
notices
herself
she
has
made
an
ample
fortune
at
any
rate
said
the
young
man
more
than
i
ever
expect
to
make
if
i
should
scribble
till
do
believe
it
said
the
old
lady
fidgeting
in
her
chair
or
if
she
has
it
wo
last
long
in
that
case
she
has
only
to
write
another
book
said
the
persistent
dana
her
books
will
always
find
a
ready
market
we
shall
see
said
the
old
lady
bridling
it
is
my
opinion
go
out
like
the
wick
of
a
candle
people
wo
read
a
second
edition
of
such
trash
ruth
hall
humph
that
accounts
humph
well
anyhow
if
she
made
money
she
had
her
nose
held
to
the
grindstone
pretty
well
first
that
one
comfort
humph
that
accounts
well
sometimes
money
is
given
for
a
curse
i
heern
tell
of
such
yes
yes
i
heern
tell
of
such
things
muttered
the
old
lady
patting
her
foot
as
her
two
visitors
left
dreadful
grand
ruth
feels
now
i
suppose
a
sight
of
money
she
made
has
she
a
great
deal
she
knows
how
to
invest
it
invest
it
what
the
use
of
talking
about
that
it
will
be
invested
on
her
back
in
silk
gowns
laces
frumpery
and
such
things
i
have
a
silk
gown
in
the
world
the
least
she
could
do
would
be
to
send
me
one
for
the
care
of
that
yes
laces
and
feathers
feathers
and
laces
the
children
too
all
tricked
but
like
little
monkeys
with
long
ostrich
legs
and
short
skirts
standing
out
like
opery
girls
and
whole
yards
of
ribbin
streaming
from
their
hair
i
warrant
the
catechize
clean
driven
out
of
katy
head
should
be
at
all
astonished
if
they
went
to
dancing
school
or
any
other
immoral
wonder
where
they
live
in
some
grand
hotel
of
course
dinner
at
six
black
servants
gold
and
nothing
short
of
that
suit
now
humph
should
be
astonished
any
day
to
hear
ruth
kept
a
carriage
and
servants
in
livery
or
had
been
to
victory
court
in
lappets
and
diamonds
she
just
impudent
enough
to
do
it
she
is
afraid
of
anybody
nor
anything
dare
say
she
will
marry
some
count
or
duke
she
has
no
more
humph
i
suppose
she
is
crowing
well
over
me
the
wheel
may
turn
round
again
who
knows
in
fact
i
am
sure
of
it
how
glad
i
be
well
i
must
say
i
did
think
she
had
so
much
perseverance
i
expected
she
just
sit
down
after
awhile
and
fret
herself
to
death
and
be
well
out
of
the
humph
i
suppose
i
sha
take
up
a
newspaper
now
without
getting
a
dose
about
her
i
dare
say
that
spiteful
young
dana
will
call
here
again
just
to
rile
me
up
by
praising
her
what
a
fool
i
was
to
get
taken
in
so
about
that
book
but
how
should
i
know
it
was
hers
i
should
as
soon
have
thought
of
her
turning
out
bonaparte
as
an
authoress
authoress
humph
wonder
how
the
heels
of
her
stockings
look
she
wears
silk
ones
now
and
french
shoes
she
was
always
as
proud
as
lucifer
of
her
well
i
must
say
as
long
as
there
nobody
here
to
hear
me
that
she
humph
she
collapse
though
there
no
doubt
of
i
heard
of
balloons
that
alighted
in

lxxxvii
good
morning
mr
ellet
said
jones
making
an
attempt
at
a
bow
which
the
stiffness
of
his
rendered
entirely
abortive
how
d
do
oh
how
are
you
jones
i
was
just
looking
over
the
household
messenger
here
reading
my
daughter
pieces
and
thinking
what
a
great
thing
it
is
for
a
child
to
have
a
good
father
was
carefully
brought
up
and
instructed
and
this
you
see
is
the
result
i
have
been
reading
several
of
her
pieces
to
a
clergyman
who
was
in
here
just
now
i
keep
them
on
hand
in
my
to
exhibit
as
a
proof
of
what
early
parental
education
and
guidance
may
do
in
developing
latent
talent
and
giving
the
mind
a
right
direction
i
was
not
aware
your
daughter
replied
jones
do
you
know
what
time
she
commenced
writing
what
was
the
title
of
her
first
article
and
what
was
her
remuneration
sir
said
ellet
wishing
to
gain
a
little
time
and
looking
very
confused
perhaps
i
should
not
ask
such
questions
said
the
innocent
jones
mistaking
the
cause
of
ellet
hesitation
but
i
felt
a
little
curiosity
to
know
something
of
her
early
progress
what
a
strong
desire
you
must
have
felt
for
her
ultimate
success
and
how
much
your
influence
and
sympathy
must
have
assisted
her
do
you
know
whether
her
remuneration
at
the
commencement
of
her
career
as
a
writer
was
above
the
ordinary
average
of
pay
yes
no
really
jones
i
will
not
venture
to
say
lest
i
should
make
a
mistake
my
memory
is
apt
to
be
so
treacherous
she
wrote
merely
for
amusement
i
suppose
there
could
be
no
in
daughter
case
said
the
blundering
jones
certainly
not
replied
ellet
it
is
astonishing
how
she
can
write
so
feelingly
about
the
poor
said
jones
it
is
so
seldom
that
an
author
succeeds
in
depicting
truthfully
those
scenes
for
which
he
draws
solely
upon
the
imagination
my
daughter
has
a
very
vivid
imagination
replied
ellet
nervously
women
generally
have
i
believe
they
are
said
to
excel
our
sex
in
i
do
know
but
it
may
be
so
said
jones
certainly
possesses
it
in
an
uncommon
degree
it
is
difficult
else
to
imagine
as
i
said
before
how
a
person
who
has
always
been
surrounded
with
comfort
and
luxury
could
describe
so
feelingly
the
other
side
of
the
picture
it
is
remarkable
do
you
know
how
much
she
has
realized
by
her

female
literature
seems
to
be
all
the
rage
now
remarked
a
gentleman
who
was
turning
over
the
volumes
in
develin
book
store
no
literary
row
who
are
your
most
successful
lady
authors
miss
pyne
said
develin
authoress
of
miss
taft
authoress
of
and
miss
bitman
authoress
of
i
have
been
told
said
the
gentleman
that
sketches
by
has
had
an
immense
sale
a
larger
one
in
fact
than
any
of
the
others
is
that
so
it
has
had
a
sale
answered
develin
coldly
i
might
have
published
it
i
suppose
had
i
applied
but
i
had
a
very
indifferent
opinion
of
the
literary
talent
of
the
authoress
the
little
popularity
it
had
is
undoubtedly
owing
to
the
writer
being
a
sister
of
hyacinth
ellet
the
editor
of
irving
magazine
but
she
his
sister
said
the
gentleman
there
are
many
rumors
afloat
one
hardly
knows
what
to
believe
no
doubt
of
it
said
develin
in
fact
i
myself
it
to
be
true
is
his
sister
and
it
is
altogether
owing
to
the
transferring
of
her
articles
by
him
to
the
columns
of
his
paper
and
his
liberal
endorsement
of
them
that
she
has
had
any
success
indeed
said
the
gentleman
why
i
was
a
subscriber
both
for
standard
when
her
first
article
appeared
in
it
and
also
for
irving
magazine
and
i
am
very
sure
that
nothing
of
hers
was
copied
in
the
latter
until
she
had
acquired
an
enviable
popularity
all
over
the
union
no
sir
said
walter
for
it
was
he
i
know
a
great
deal
more
about
and
her
writings
than
can
tell
me
and
some
little
about
yourself
i
have
often
heard
of
the
version
you
give
of
this
matter
and
i
came
in
to
satisfy
myself
if
it
had
been
correctly
reported
to
me
now
allow
me
to
set
you
right
sir
said
he
with
a
stern
look
the
editor
of
irving
magazine
never
recognized
as
his
sister
till
the
universal
popular
voice
had
pronounced
its
verdict
in
her
favor
then
when
the
steam
was
up
and
the
locomotive
whizzing
past
he
jumps
on
and
says
fast
go
i
think
you
are
mistaken
sir
replied
develin
with
a
faint
attempt
to
retain
his
position
i
am
not
mistaken
sir
i
know
personally
that
in
the
commencement
of
her
literary
career
when
one
or
two
articles
of
hers
were
copied
into
his
paper
by
an
assistant
in
the
office
he
positively
forbade
her
de
being
again
mentioned
or
another
of
her
articles
copied
into
the
irving
magazine
he
is
a
miserable
sir
fashion
is
his
god
he
recognizes
only
the
side
of
human
nature
sorrow
in
satin
he
can
sympathize
with
but
sorrow
in
rags
is
too
plebeian
for
his
exquisite
organization
good
morning
develin
good
morning
sir
the
next
time
i
hear
of
your
giving
a
version
of
this
matter
i
trust
it
will
be
a
correct
one
added
he
with
a
stern
look
well
exclaimed
walter
as
he
walked
down
street
of
all
mean
meanness
of
which
a
man
can
be
guilty
the
meanest
in
my
estimation
is
to
rob
a
woman
of
her
literary
fame
and
i
wish
for
the
credit
of
human
nature
it
were
confined
to
persons
of
as
limited
mental
endowments
and
influence
as
the
one
i
have
just
left
chapter
lxxxix
oh
how
frightened
i
was
exclaimed
nettie
as
her
mother
applied
some
healing
salve
to
a
slight
burn
on
her
arm
how
frightened
i
was
at
that
fire
you
mean
how
frightened
you
were
the
fire
replied
her
mother
smiling
you
were
so
bewildered
waking
up
out
of
that
sound
sleep
that
i
fancy
you
did
not
understand
much
about
the
danger
till
after
good
johnny
galt
saved
you
if
i
did
not
love
neddy
so
much
i
should
certainly
give
johnny
galt
my
picture
said
nettie
with
a
sudden
outburst
of
enthusiasm
i
will
see
that
johnny
galt
is
rewarded
replied
ruth
but
this
is
the
day
walter
was
to
have
come
i
hope
johnny
galt
will
meet
him
at
the
dépôt
as
he
promised
else
he
will
be
so
alarmed
about
our
safety
when
he
learns
of
the
fire
dear
me
how
the
rain
comes
down
it
looks
as
though
it
meant
to
persevere
yes
and
too
said
nettie
with
an
arch
look
at
her
mother
katy
and
ruth
had
not
finished
laughing
at
this
sally
when
walter
was
announced
his
greeting
was
grave
for
he
trembled
to
think
of
the
danger
they
had
escaped
after
mutual
congratulations
had
been
exchanged
a
detailed
account
of
their
escape
given
and
johnny
galt
heroism
duly
extolled
walter
said
well
i
am
glad
to
find
you
so
comfortably
housed
after
the
fire
but
the
sooner
i
take
all
of
you
under
my
charge
the
better
i
think
what
do
you
say
to
starting
for
are
you
sufficiently
recovered
from
your
fright
and
fatigue
oh
yes
replied
ruth
laughing
do
we
not
look
as
good
as
new
our
wardrobe
to
be
sure
is
in
rather
a
slender
condition
but
that
is
much
easier
remedied
than
a
slender
purse
as
i
have
good
reason
to
know
very
well
then
said
walter
it
is
understood
that
we
go
i
have
some
business
to
look
after
in
the
morning
shall
you
object
to
waiting
till
after
dinner
not
at
all
replied
ruth
in
my
opinion
nothing
can
equal
the
forlornness
of
forsaking
a
warm
bed
to
start
breakfastless
on
a
journey
with
one
eyes
half
open
said
walter
taking
a
package
from
his
pocket
i
have
obeyed
your
directions
and
here
is
something
which
you
may
well
be
proud
of
and
he
handed
ruth

there
said
walter

imagine
yourself
if
you

dismal

one
year
ago
a
holder
now
confess
that
you
are
proud
of
yourself
we
are
proud
of
her
said
the
talkative
nettie
if
she
is
not
proud
of
herself
do
you
think
it
is
too
bad
walter
that
mamma
let
katy
and
me
tell
that
is
our
mother
a
little
girl
who
lived
at
the
hotel
that
was
burnt
up
said
to
katy
that
her
uncle
had
just
given
her
life
sketches
for
a
present
and
told
her
that
she
must
try
and
write
as
well
as
one
of
these
days
and
katy
looked
at
me
and
i
looked
at
katy
and
oh
is
it
walter
that
mamma
wo
let
us
tell
when
we
want
to
so
much
well
said
walter
laughing
i
have
only
one
little
remark
to
make
about
that
namely
i
have
no
doubt
you
two
young
ladies
discovered
some
time
before
i
did
that
when
your
mamma
says
there
is
an
end
to
all
argument
chapter
xc
the
morning
of
the
next
day
was
bright
and
fair
after
dinner
our
travelling
party
entered
the
carriage
in
waiting
and
proceeded
on
their
way
the
children
chattering
as
usual
like
little
magpies
and
ruth
and
walter
occupied
with
their
own
solitary
reflections
one
of
the
greatest
luxuries
of
friendship
is
the
perfect
freedom
one
feels
irrespective
of
the
presence
of
another
to
indulge
in
the
mood
of
the
moment
whether
that
mood
be
grave
or
gay
taciturn
or
loquacious
the
unspeakable
deliciousness
of
being
reprieved
from
talking
at
a
mark
hampered
by
no
fear
of
incivility
or
discourtesy
ruth
had
found
this
a
great
charm
in
the
society
of
walter
who
seemed
perfectly
to
understand
and
sympathize
with
her
varied
moods
on
the
present
occasion
she
particularly
felt
its
value
oppressed
as
she
was
by
the
rush
of
thoughts
retrospective
and
anticipatory
standing
as
it
were
on
the
threshold
of
a
new
epoch
in
her
changing
existence
where
are
we
going
mother
asked
katy
as
the
carriage
passed
through
a
and
down
a
dim
avenue
of
ancient
trees
to
dear
papa
grave
replied
ruth
before
we
leave
this
part
of
the
country
yes
murmured
katy
in
a
low
whisper
it
was
very
beautiful
that
old
avenue
of
pine
trees
through
which
the
setting
sun
was
struggling
faintly
now
resting
like
a
halo
on
some
now
gilding
some
more
ambitious
monument
of
mammon
raising
the
winding
cemetery
paths
thronged
by
day
with
careless
feet
were
silent
now
no
lightsome
laughter
echoed
through
those
leafy
dells
grating
upon
the
ear
which
almost
listened
for
the
loved
voice
no
strange
eye
with
curious
gaze
followed
the
thoughtful
group
speculating
upon
their
heart
hidden
history
but
now
and
then
a
little
loitering
bird
tempted
beyond
its
mate
to
lengthen
its
evening
flight
flitted
with
a
brief
gush
of
song
across
their
pathway
hushed
holy
and
unprofaned
was
this
sabbath
of
the
dead
aching
hearts
here
throbbed
with
pain
no
longer
weary
feet
were
still
busy
hands
lay
idly
crossed
over
tired
breasts
babes
who
had
poised
one
tiny
foot
on
life
turbid
ocean
brink
then
shrank
back
affrighted
at
its
surging
waves
here
slept
their
peaceful
sleep
the
moon
had
silvered
the
old
chapel
turrets
and
the
little
nodding
flowers
glistened
with
but
still
ruth
lingered
old
memories
were
thronging
thick
and
fast
upon
her
past
joys
past
sorrows
past
sufferings
and
yet
the
heart
which
felt
them
all
so
keenly
would
soon
lie
pulseless
amid
these
mouldering
thousands
there
was
a
vacant
place
left
by
the
side
of
harry
ruth
eye
rested
on
it
then
on
her
children
then
on
walter
so
help
me
god
reverently
murmured
the
latter
interpreting
the
mute
appeal
as
the
carriage
rolled
from
under
the
old
stone
gateway
a
little
bird
startled
from
out
its
leafy
nest
trilled
forth
a
song
as
sweet
and
clear
as
the
lark
at
heaven
own
blessed
gate
