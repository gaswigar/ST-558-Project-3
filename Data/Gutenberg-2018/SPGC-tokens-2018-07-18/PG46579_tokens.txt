the
trouble
with
answers
limited
introduction
the
intention
of
both
the
author
and
the
editor
of
this
little
book
has
been
to
set
forth
as
plainly
and
as
simply
as
possible
certain
facts
and
opinions
with
regard
to
what
is
undoubtedly
a
most
important
subject
the
carrying
out
of
the
ultimate
sentence
of
the
law
while
facts
have
not
been
in
any
way
shirked
or
misrepresented
much
that
is
horrible
in
detail
has
been
suppressed
so
that
people
who
may
be
tempted
to
take
up
the
book
in
search
of
ghastly
descriptive
writing
are
warned
at
the
outset
that
they
will
be
disappointed
it
is
believed
that
a
publication
of
berry
experiences
will
correct
many
errors
and
misconceptions
as
to
the
way
in
which
capital
sentences
are
carried
out
in
england
and
that
it
will
lead
to
a
consideration
of
the
whole
subject
from
a
practical
rather
than
from
a
sentimental
point
of
view
the
management
and
if
possible
the
regeneration
of
the
criminal
classes
is
one
of
the
most
serious
tasks
that
civilisation
has
to
face
and
those
who
undertake
such
a
task
require
all
the
light
that
can
possibly
be
thrown
upon
the
subject
the
public
executioner
has
many
and
special
opportunities
of
studying
the
criminal
classes
and
of
knowing
their
attitude
and
feelings
with
regard
to
that
capital
punishment
which
civilisation
regards
as
its
strongest
weapon
in
the
war
against
crime
when
as
in
the
case
of
berry
several
experience
in
various
police
forces
can
be
added
to
his
experience
as
an
executioner
the
man
who
has
had
these
exceptional
opportunities
of
studying
criminals
and
crime
must
necessarily
have
gathered
much
information
and
formed
opinions
that
are
worthy
of
attention
therefore
this
book
has
a
higher
aim
than
the
mere
recording
of
the
circumstances
and
incidents
of
the
most
painful
business
in
which
a
man
can
engage
the
recording
is
necessary
for
without
the
facts
before
them
readers
could
not
form
their
own
opinions
but
it
is
hoped
that
the
facts
will
be
read
with
more
than
mere
curiosity
that
the
readers
will
be
led
to
take
a
personal
interest
in
the
weak
and
erring
brethren
who
form
the
criminal
classes
the
of
our
social
system
an
explanation
of
how
this
book
was
written
may
not
be
out
of
place
the
statements
are
those
of
the
author
though
in
many
cases
the
words
are
those
of
the
editor
whose
task
consisted
of
and
very
greatly
condensing
the
mass
of
matter
placed
in
his
hands
by
berry
the
narrative
and
descriptive
portion
of
the
work
is
taken
from
a
series
of
and
a
book
kept
by
berry
who
includes
the
most
minute
particulars
in
his
diaries
one
chapter
my
first
execution
is
word
for
word
as
written
in
the
diary
with
the
exception
that
a
few
whole
pages
of
descriptive
detail
are
omitted
and
indicated
by
points
thus
the
chapter
on
capital
punishment
and
portions
of
other
chapters
were
not
written
out
at
length
by
berry
but
were
supplied
in
the
form
of
full
notes
and
the
principal
portions
dictated
in
every
case
however
the
opinions
are
those
of
the
author
with
whom
the
editor
is
by
no
means
in
entire
personal
agreement
chapter
i
the
executioner
at
home
by
snowden
ward
james
berry
though
regarded
by
some
people
as
a
monster
and
by
others
as
a
curiosity
is
very
much
like
any
other
when
one
comes
to
know
him
he
is
neither
a
paragon
of
perfection
nor
an
embodiment
of
all
vice
though
different
classes
of
people
have
at
times
placed
him
under
both
these
descriptions
his
character
is
a
curious
study
a
mixture
of
very
strong
and
very
weak
traits
such
as
is
seldom
found
in
one
person
and
although
one
of
his
weak
points
is
his
yorkshire
frankness
which
he
tries
to
control
as
much
as
possible
the
man
who
has
only
been
with
him
a
few
days
has
not
by
any
means
got
to
the
depths
of
his
character
his
wife
has
said
to
me
more
than
once
i
have
lived
with
him
for
nineteen
years
but
i
do
thoroughly
know
him
yet
and
one
can
quite
understand
it
as
his
character
is
so
and
in
some
respects
contradictory
this
partly
accounts
for
the
varying
and
contradictory
views
of
his
personality
which
have
been
published
in
different
papers
his
strongest
point
is
his
perhaps
this
may
be
doubted
but
i
state
the
fact
from
ample
knowledge
occupation
was
not
by
any
means
taken
up
from
a
love
of
the
ghastly
or
any
pleasure
in
the
work
even
in
his
business
as
executioner
his
has
shown
itself
for
though
it
has
never
caused
him
to
flinch
on
the
scaffold
it
has
led
him
to
study
most
carefully
the
science
of
his
subject
and
to
take
great
pains
to
make
death
painless
of
this
trait
i
have
had
many
proofs
for
instance
i
know
that
on
some
occasions
when
he
has
been
due
to
start
for
a
place
of
execution
his
repugnance
to
the
task
has
been
so
great
that
his
wife
and
her
mother
have
been
obliged
to
use
the
greatest
possible
force
of
persuasion
to
prevent
him
shirking
his
duty
another
instance
of
this
characteristic
appeared
when
i
was
overhauling
his
manuscript
and
cuttings
for
the
purpose
of
this
book
i
came
across
a
copy
of
a
poem
for
one
under
sentence
of
death
and
made
some
enquiry
about
it
i
found
that
the
lines
were
some
which
berry
had
copied
from
a
dorchester
newspaper
and
that
for
a
long
time
it
had
been
his
habit
to
make
a
copy
of
them
to
send
to
the
chaplain
in
every
case
where
a
prisoner
was
sentenced
to
death
with
a
request
that
they
should
be
read
to
the
prisoner
this
was
continued
until
the
governor
of
one
of
the
gaols
resented
the
sending
of
such
a
poem
to
the
chaplain
and
intimated
that
in
all
cases
the
chaplain
was
best
able
to
judge
of
what
was
necessary
for
the
condemned
man
and
did
not
need
any
outside
interference
after
this
berry
sent
no
more
poems
but
he
kept
one
or
two
copies
by
him
and
i
think
that
it
may
interest
the
reader
lines
for
one
under
sentence
of
death
my
brother
sit
and
think
while
yet
some
hours
on
earth
are
left
to
thee
kneel
to
thy
god
who
does
not
from
thee
shrink
and
lay
thy
sins
on
christ
who
died
for
thee
he
rests
his
wounded
hand
with
loving
kindness
on
thy
brow
and
says
here
at
thy
side
i
ready
stand
to
make
thy
scarlet
sins
as
white
as
snow
i
did
not
shed
my
blood
for
sinless
angels
good
and
pure
and
true
for
hopeless
sinners
flowed
that
crimson
flood
my
heart
blood
ran
for
you
my
son
for
you
though
thou
hast
grieved
me
sore
my
arms
of
mercy
still
are
open
wide
i
still
hold
open
heaven
shining
door
come
then
take
refuge
in
my
wounded
side
men
shun
thee
but
not
i
come
close
to
me
i
love
my
erring
sheep
my
blood
can
cleanse
thy
sins
of
blackest
dye
i
understand
if
thou
canst
only
weep
words
fail
thee
never
mind
thy
saviour
can
read
a
sigh
or
tear
i
came
heart
to
heal
and
bind
and
died
to
save
thee
to
my
heart
dear
come
now
the
time
is
short
longing
to
pardon
and
to
bless
i
wait
look
up
to
me
my
sheep
so
dearly
bought
and
say
forgive
me
it
is
too
late
the
of
berry
nature
would
quite
unfit
him
for
his
post
if
it
were
not
that
he
possesses
a
strong
resolution
and
can
control
his
feelings
when
he
finds
duty
warring
against
inclination
in
personal
appearance
he
is
a
man
thickset
and
muscular
with
a
florid
complexion
and
sandy
hair
he
stands
high
weighs
stones
and
does
not
look
the
sort
of
man
to
willingly
injure
anyone
the
appearance
of
his
right
cheek
is
somewhat
marred
by
a
long
deep
scar
extending
downwards
from
the
corner
of
the
eye
which
has
given
rise
to
one
or
two
sensational
stories
from
the
pens
of
imaginative
newspaper
men
the
scar
was
caused
by
the
kick
of
a
horse
which
he
attempted
to
ride
when
he
was
a
boy
about
ten
years
old
the
horse
was
young
unbroken
and
vicious
and
its
kick
narrowly
missed
being
fatal
across
his
forehead
is
another
great
scar
the
result
of
a
terrible
blow
received
when
arresting
a
desperate
character
in
a
bradford
the
man
was
one
of
a
gang
of
six
and
his
comrades
helped
him
to
violently
resist
arrest
but
berry
stuck
to
his
captive
until
he
was
safely
locked
in
the
bradford
town
hall
and
the
six
men
all
had
to
do
time
for
the
assault
berry
was
born
on
february
at
heckmondwike
in
yorkshire
his
father
was
a
holding
a
good
position
in
the
district
young
berry
education
was
obtained
at
the
wrea
green
school
near
lytham
where
he
gained
several
prizes
for
his
writing
and
drawing
his
writing
ability
was
useful
to
him
later
in
life
when
he
was
employed
by
a
lithographer
to
write
transfers
in
he
was
married
and
has
had
six
children
of
these
two
boys
and
a
girl
died
while
young
and
two
boys
and
a
girl
are
living
the
executioner
office
as
berry
likes
to
call
it
on
his
official
communications
is
a
house
just
off
city
road
bradford
it
is
one
of
six
owned
by
berry
when
he
first
took
the
position
of
executioner
some
of
his
neighbours
were
so
prejudiced
against
the
work
that
they
refused
to
live
next
door
to
a
hangman
and
as
landlords
naturally
object
to
losing
two
or
three
tenants
for
the
sake
of
keeping
one
berry
was
obliged
to
move
once
or
twice
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
had
better
be
his
own
landlord
the
prejudice
which
then
existed
has
been
lived
down
and
there
is
now
no
difficulty
in
letting
neighbouring
houses
to
respectable
tenants
the
house
in
bilton
place
is
furnished
just
the
same
as
hundred
of
other
houses
in
the
district
that
are
occupied
by
artisans
and
there
is
nothing
at
all
gloomy
or
gruesome
about
the
place
in
fact
there
is
no
indication
of
the
business
of
the
occupant
there
are
in
the
front
room
two
frames
of
small
photographs
which
are
really
portraits
of
some
of
the
murderers
who
have
been
executed
by
berry
but
the
frames
bear
no
inscription
in
a
sideboard
too
there
are
a
few
handsome
electro
goblets
cruet
stands
and
similar
articles
that
have
been
given
to
berry
by
some
of
his
admirers
but
no
one
would
connect
them
with
his
business
in
drawers
and
cupboards
about
the
place
there
are
or
were
for
they
have
now
gone
to
madame
tussaud
a
large
number
of
relics
and
mementos
of
executions
and
other
incidents
amongst
them
is
the
great
knife
once
used
by
the
executioner
of
canton
for
the
beheading
of
nine
pirates
this
was
obtained
in
exchange
for
a
rope
with
which
several
persons
had
been
hanged
these
relics
were
all
stowed
well
away
and
were
not
by
any
means
on
show
though
the
executioner
did
not
object
to
producing
them
if
a
personal
friend
wished
to
see
them
in
conversation
berry
is
fluent
apt
in
anecdote
and
illustration
and
full
of
a
subtle
yorkshire
humour
which
he
can
not
entirely
shake
off
even
when
talking
on
serious
subjects
he
has
a
very
good
memory
for
facts
and
is
very
observant
so
that
he
is
always
ready
with
a
personal
experience
or
observation
on
almost
any
topic
his
tastes
are
simple
his
favourite
occupations
are
fishing
and
otter
hunting
of
both
of
which
sports
he
is
passionately
fond
frequently
when
going
to
an
execution
in
a
country
town
he
takes
his
rod
and
basket
and
gets
a
fishing
before
or
after
the
execution
he
seems
to
like
the
sport
on
account
of
its
quiet
and
contemplative
nature
and
says
that
he
enjoys
the
fishing
even
if
he
never
gets
a
nibble
at
home
berry
devotes
himself
largely
to
mechanical
pursuits
at
the
present
time
he
is
working
a
patent
which
he
bought
recently
and
has
the
topmost
room
of
his
house
fitted
as
a
mechanic
workshop
with
lathe
bench
etc
in
spare
time
he
devotes
a
good
deal
of
attention
to
his
pigeons
and
rabbits
for
he
is
an
ardent
fancier
and
keeps
a
large
number
of
live
pets
chapter
ii
how
i
became
an
executioner
it
has
been
said
by
some
of
those
moralists
who
are
always
anxious
to
point
out
sad
examples
of
the
depravity
of
man
and
who
are
not
very
particular
about
the
genuineness
of
the
facts
with
which
they
support
their
theories
that
i
was
fond
even
as
a
boy
of
revelling
in
the
revolting
details
of
crime
and
that
i
was
a
reader
of
all
the
police
literature
that
i
could
obtain
such
statements
are
absolutely
false
as
a
boy
i
was
not
a
great
reader
on
any
subject
and
the
proceedings
of
the
courts
and
the
careers
of
criminals
were
in
no
wise
interesting
to
me
until
i
became
a
member
of
the
bradford
borough
police
force
in
when
a
policeman
i
strove
to
do
my
duty
as
well
as
any
man
could
and
often
wished
that
i
could
make
some
better
provision
for
my
wife
and
family
but
i
never
so
much
as
dreamed
of
becoming
an
executioner
or
took
any
interest
in
the
subject
of
hanging
one
day
when
i
called
at
a
friend
house
that
was
on
my
beat
it
happened
that
marwood
was
staying
there
and
i
was
introduced
to
him
and
a
few
days
later
i
again
met
him
and
spent
an
evening
in
his
company
he
was
a
quiet
unassuming
man
kindly
and
almost
benevolent
in
his
manner
who
was
in
no
way
ashamed
of
his
calling
though
very
reticent
about
speaking
of
it
excepting
to
those
whom
he
knew
well
he
keenly
felt
the
odium
with
which
his
office
was
regarded
by
the
public
and
aimed
by
performing
his
duties
in
a
satisfactory
manner
and
by
conducting
his
private
life
respectably
at
removing
the
stigma
which
he
felt
was
undeserved
at
times
the
attitude
of
the
public
towards
him
was
very
keenly
felt
and
i
well
remember
one
time
when
this
subject
was
the
topic
of
conversation
at
the
supper
table
that
he
remarked
to
a
gentleman
present
my
position
is
not
a
pleasant
one
and
turning
to
me
repeated
with
emphasis
no
it
is
a
pleasant
one
the
words
seemed
to
come
from
the
depths
of
a
full
heart
and
i
shall
never
forget
their
pathos
and
feeling
altogether
marwood
never
encouraged
me
in
any
way
to
think
of
his
calling
with
feelings
of
envy
and
though
he
did
give
me
all
particulars
of
his
methods
and
apparatus
it
was
merely
because
i
asked
all
sorts
of
questions
from
natural
curiosity
it
was
only
when
in
company
with
marwood
with
whom
i
became
quite
friendly
that
i
ever
contemplated
the
question
of
capital
punishment
at
other
times
it
was
far
from
my
thoughts
my
application
for
the
post
which
was
left
vacant
at
his
death
was
therefore
in
no
way
the
result
of
a
personal
desire
for
the
work
or
of
a
plan
i
was
simply
driven
to
it
by
the
condition
of
my
family
which
i
was
unable
to
keep
in
reasonable
comfort
upon
my
earnings
i
was
then
engaged
as
a
at
a
small
salary
i
knew
that
in
the
line
on
which
i
was
then
working
there
was
no
prospect
of
a
material
improvement
in
my
position
i
knew
that
i
was
a
man
of
no
extraordinary
ability
so
that
my
chances
of
rising
were
few
and
i
looked
upon
the
vacancy
of
the
executioner
post
as
being
probably
my
one
chance
in
life
my
tide
in
the
affairs
of
men
personally
i
had
a
great
distaste
for
the
work
though
i
did
not
consider
it
in
any
way
dishonourable
or
degrading
and
i
had
to
weigh
my
family
wants
against
my
personal
inclination
it
seemed
to
me
at
the
time
that
my
duty
was
clear
so
i
made
application
for
the
vacant
position
it
may
be
said
that
i
decided
to
better
myself
without
any
regard
to
the
means
of
that
betterment
or
to
my
fitness
for
the
position
but
when
i
carefully
considered
the
matter
in
the
few
days
before
sending
in
my
application
i
was
convinced
that
i
could
do
the
work
as
well
as
anyone
and
that
i
could
make
practical
improvements
in
some
of
the
methods
and
somewhat
improve
the
lot
of
those
appointed
to
die
this
last
consideration
finally
decided
me
i
made
application
to
the
sheriffs
of
london
and
middlesex
in
september
there
were
some
applicants
for
the
post
but
after
waiting
some
time
i
received
the
following
letter
intimating
that
i
was
one
of
the
few
from
amongst
whom
the
final
choice
was
to
be
made
london
the
sheriffs
of
london
and
middlesex
will
be
at
the
old
bailey
on
monday
next
the
instant
at
for
the
purpose
of
seeing
the
selected
applicants
for
the
post
of
executioner
if
you
as
one
of
those
selected
for
consideration
are
disposed
to
attend
at
the
above
time
and
place
you
are
at
liberty
at
your
own
expense
to
do
so
september
to
berry
of
course
i
kept
the
appointment
was
duly
examined
amongst
some
nineteen
others
and
was
told
that
the
chosen
executioner
would
be
communicated
with
my
action
in
applying
for
the
post
was
not
at
all
in
accordance
with
the
wishes
of
my
relatives
who
did
everything
they
possibly
could
to
prevent
my
obtaining
it
some
of
my
friends
and
neighbours
wrote
either
through
solicitors
or
personally
to
the
sheriffs
certain
members
of
my
own
family
petitioned
the
home
secretary
to
dismiss
the
application
on
the
ground
that
if
the
appointment
was
given
to
me
a
hitherto
respectable
family
would
be
disgraced
i
believe
that
it
was
mainly
in
consequence
of
these
representations
that
i
was
passed
over
and
the
post
given
to
bartholomew
binns
upon
myself
the
opposition
had
an
effect
that
was
not
intended
it
made
me
devote
considerable
thought
and
care
to
the
details
of
the
work
of
an
executioner
and
made
me
determine
that
if
ever
the
opportunity
again
offered
i
should
do
my
best
to
secure
the
work
during
the
four
months
that
binns
held
the
appointment
i
had
consultations
with
some
eminent
medical
men
and
when
much
earlier
than
i
expected
a
new
executioner
was
wanted
i
was
very
well
grounded
in
the
theory
of
the
subject
it
was
in
march
that
the
magistrates
of
the
city
of
edinburgh
wanted
a
man
to
execute
vickers
and
innes
two
poachers
the
sheriffs
of
london
and
middlesex
gave
me
a
recommendation

my
first
execution
a
on
the

i
received
a
letter
from
the
clerk
city
chambers
edinburgh
appointing
me
to
act
as
executioner
on
march
at
calton
gaol
and
that
i
was
to
provide
all
necessary
appliances
for
carrying
out
the
same
i
undertook
the
duties
and
on
thursday
march
i
departed
from
my
home
bradford
and
made
my
way
to
the
midland
station
and
booked
class
for
edinburgh
to
carry
out
the
execution
of
the
gorebridge
murderers
i
arrived
at
waverley
station
and
i
hired
a
cab
to
drive
me
to
the
gaol
on
arrival
at
the
prison
i
was
met
at
the
doors
by
a
warder
dressed
in
ordinary
prison
garb
and
very
courteous
and
on
entering
the
large
portal
gate
was
asked
my
name
and
after
entering
it
down
in
the
prison
book
time
he
pulled
a
string
which
rang
the
governor
bell
and
in
a
few
moments
i
was
confronted
with
the
governor
a
very
nice
gentleman
of
military
appearance
and
very
good
looking
after
passing
the
usual
conversation
of
the
day
and
the
weather
and
what
kind
of
journey
i
had
up
from
bradford
he
said
after
such
a
long
journey
i
should
require
a
good
substantial
tea
and
as
soon
as
i
had
washed
and
combed
my
hair
the
tea
was
there
everything
that
could
be
desired
i
sat
down
and
quite
enjoyed
my
first
scotch
meal
in
bonnie
scotland
an
examination
of
himself
and
his
apparatus
by
the
governor
and
his
own
inspection
of
the
scaffold
are
then
described
at
i
returned
to
my
room
and
stayed
in
during
the
daytime
i
spent
the
thursday
night
smoking
and
reading
at
i
was
escorted
to
my
bedroom
a
round
house
at
the
back
part
of
the
gaol
about
yards
from
the
back
entrance
a
snug
little
place
and
was
informed
that
the
last
man
who
slept
inside
that
room
was
wm
marwood
five
years
previous
to
my
visit
he
was
then
there
for
the
same
purpose
as
myself
but
the
culprit
in
his
case
was
a
poisoner
the
chief
warder
whom
i
spoke
to
seemed
to
touch
upon
the
subject
with
great
reluctance
and
said
that
he
felt
quite
upset
concerning
the
two
culprits
and
that
he
hoped
they
would
get
a
reprieve
i
could
see
in
his
countenance
a
deep
expression
of
grief
which
was
making
him
look
no
better
for
his
occupation
i
sat
me
down
on
my
bed
after
he
had
gone
locked
my
door
and
could
hear
the
trains
depart
from
the
station
under
the
prison
wall
i
looked
out
of
my
window
at
the
mail
taking
its
departure
for
the
south
i
then
knelt
down
and
asked
the
almighty
to
help
me
in
my
most
painful
task
which
i
had
undertaken
to
carry
out
the
night
was
much
disturbed
by
the
persistent
smoking
of
the
at
on
the
morning
of
the
friday
my
breakfast
was
brought
into
my
room
consisting
of
toast
ham
and
eggs
and
coffee
at
on
friday
morning
march
i
was
introduced
to
the
magistrates
and
those
responsible
to
see
the
execution
carried
out
i
exposed
my
ropes
and
straps
for
their
inspection
and
after
a
long
and
careful
investigation
of
all
points
they
retired
quite
satisfied
with
their
visit
after
that
we
paid
another
visit
to
the
scaffold
the
builders
not
having
finished
the
contract
were
making
a
final
touch
to
the
shed
to
keep
the
execution
private
and
so
that
nobody
outside
could
see
after
testing
it
with
bags
of
cement
same
weight
as
the
prisoners
and
calculating
the
length
of
drop
and
its
consequences
and
other
details
the
committee
departed
after
i
filled
my
time
walking
about
the
prison
grounds
and
thinking
of
the
poor
men
who
were
nearing
their
end
full
of
life
and
knowing
the
fatal
hour
which
made
me
quite
ill
to
think
about
my
meals
did
not
seem
to
do
me
good
my
appetite
began
to
fall
off
nothing
felt
good
to
me
everything
that
i
put
into
my
mouth
felt
like
sand
and
i
felt
as
i
wished
i
had
never
undertaken
such
an
awful
calling
i
regretted
for
a
while
and
then
i
thought
the
public
would
only
think
i
had
not
the
pluck
and
i
would
not
allow
my
feelings
to
overthrow
me
so
i
never
gave
way
to
such
thoughts
again
at
my
dinner
had
arrived
i
went
up
to
my
room
and
sat
down
to
pudding
beef
and
vegetables
scotch
broth
and
cochrane
cantrell
ginger
ale
at
that
time
i
was
a
total
abstainer
and
i
think
it
is
the
safest
side
since
what
i
have
seen
brought
on
by
its
sad
consequences
of
taking
too
much
alcoholic
liquor
after
tea
i
had
a
chat
with
the
warders
coming
off
duty
for
the
day
as
they
passed
through
the
wicket
gate
one
remarked
he
looks
a
nice
fellow
for
a
job
like
that
another
says
but
he
has
a
wicked
eye
and
he
would
be
sure
i
could
do
it
i
was
left
smoking
in
the
lodge
with
the
and
one
warder
who
stayed
behind
to
see
what
he
could
hear
me
say
but
i
looked
him
over
and
could
see
by
the
look
of
his
face
that
i
was
not
to
say
much
in
his
presence
as
he
was
built
that
way
i
was
left
alone
with
the
and
he
looked
like
a
straight
honest
man
and
he
was
like
myself
he
said
i
am
glad
you
never
began
to
say
anything
in
the
presence
of
that
man
as
he
would
stop
until
saturday
morning
after
breakfast
had
another
interview
with
the
magistrates
and
made
the
final
arrangements
i
tested
the
scaffold
in
their
presence
with
the
ropes
i
was
going
to
use
on
the
monday
morning
with
bags
of
cement
each
bag
being
placed
in
the
same
places
as
was
marked
for
the
criminals
vickers
weighing
stones
and
over
feet
drop
and
innes
stones
feet
one
bag
represented
one
and
the
other
bag
the
other
i
tested
the
ropes
by
letting
off
the
traps
and
down
went
the
bags
and
i
got
my
calculations
from
that
point
after
seeing
the
ropes
tested
with
the
weight
of
cement
they
all
looked
quite
satisfied
with
the
results
the
rope
was
of
italian
silk
hemp
made
specially
for
the
work
inch
in
thickness
and
very
pliable
running
through
a
brass
thimble
which
causes
dislocation
and
a
painless
death
if
rightly
adjusted
after
dining
i
had
the
honour
of
having
a
drive
in
an
open
carriage
provided
by
the
governor
for
a
couple
of
hours
which
i
enjoyed
after
being
inside
the
prison
gates
since
my
arrival
on
thursday
i
gave
my
friend
another
night
visit
at
the
lodge
gate
we
chatted
on
different
topics
of
the
day
and
spent
a
nice
jovial
evening
together
smoking
our
weed
when
a
voice
came
to
the
door
from
a
visitor
from
the
offices
of
the
town
that
a
reprieve
was
refused
and
the
law
was
to
take
its
course
and
i
had
a
paper
sent
with
the
words
in
full
gorebridge
murderers
no
reprieve
which
made
me
feel
as
bad
as
the
condemned
men
for
a
time
but
what
with
the
jolly
and
another
of
the
warders
i
drove
it
out
of
my
mind
for
a
while
i
retired
to
bed
as
usual
at
after
reciting
my
prayers
and
thinking
only
another
night
and
i
shall
be
back
with
my
wife
and
children
saturday
night
i
was
very
restless
and
i
did
not
feel
so
much
refreshed
for
my
night
sleep
as
i
was
thinking
of
the
poor
creatures
who
was
slumbering
their
hours
away
in
the
prison
cell
just
beyond
where
i
was
laid
thinking
of
the
dreadful
fate
that
awaited
them
in
such
a
short
space
of
time
two
men
in
full
bloom
and
had
to
come
to
such
an
untimely
end
leaving
wives
and
large
families
one
poor
woman
i
was
informed
her
mind
was
so
affected
that
she
was
removed
to
the
asylum
she
took
it
so
to
heart
i
retired
to
my
at
the
front
entrance
where
i
only
partook
very
sparingly
of
the
nice
and
tempting
ham
and
poached
eggs
put
before
me
i
spent
most
of
the
forenoon
looking
round
inside
the
prison
while
the
prisoners
was
at
chapel
until
dinner
time
my
dinner
did
not
arrive
until
which
is
called
late
dinner
consisting
of
rice
pudding
black
currants
chicken
vegetables
potatoes
bread
and
the
usual
teetotal
beverages
i
tried
to
make
the
best
of
it
but
all
that
i
could
do
was
to
look
at
it
as
my
appetite
was
gone
but
i
managed
to
eat
a
little
before
going
to
roost
for
the
last
night
i
retired
at
on
sunday
but
only
had
cat
naps
all
night
one
eye
shut
and
the
other
open
thinking
and
fancying
things
that
never
will
be
and
which
is
impossible
i
was
dressed
and
up
at
and
felt
more
dead
than
alive
as
i
had
such
a
responsible
part
to
play
in
the
programme
for
the
day
i
fancied
the
ropes
breaking
i
fancied
i
was
trembling
and
could
not
do
it
i
fancied
i
fell
sick
just
at
the
last
push
i
was
nearly
frantic
in
my
mind
but
i
never
let
them
know
arrived
i
heard
the
sound
of
the
keys
clattering
of
doors
sliding
of
bolts
breakfast
had
to
be
served
earlier
than
usual
no
prisoner
allowed
out
of
his
cell
until
all
was
over
the
public
had
begun
to
assemble
on
calton
hill
in
groups
arrived
i
made
my
way
to

locking

until
the
procession
enters
for
the
great
event
of
the
day
at
the
living
group
wended
their
way
to
the
prison
and
into
the
doctor
room
ready
for
the
last
scene
of
the
drama
the
prisoners
were
brought
face
to
face
for
the
first
time
since
their
conviction
they
kissed
each
other
and
the
scene
was
a
very
painful
one
to
see
mates
going
to
meet
their
end
on
the
gallows
they
were
conducted
to
the
room
adjoining
the
doctor
room
and
were
in
prayer
with
the
two
ministers
in
attendance
after
i
was
called
to
do
my
duty
i
was
handed
the
warrant
which
was
made
out
by
the
judge
who
condemned
them
to
die
i
then
proceeded
to
pinion
the
prisoners
previously
shaking
hands
bidding
to
this
world
both
men
seemed
to
feel
the
position
very
much
the
procession
was
formed
headed
by
the
high
bailiff
the
chaplain
reading
the
litany
for
the
dead
both
the
prisoners
walked
without
assistance
to
place
of
execution
they
was
at
once
placed
under
the
beam
on
the
drop
where
everything
was
done
as
quick
as
lightning
and
both
culprits
paid
the
highest
penalty
of
the
law
the
magistrates
and
doctors
and
even
the
pressmen
admitted
that
the
execution
of
the
two
men
had
been
carried
out
in
an
humane

possibly
could
be

i

just
merely
drank
a
cup
of
coffee
but
eating
was
out

this
was

it

fear
it

my

i
feel

opinions

are

the
matter
i
believe
that
in

execution
the
authorities
have
been
perfectly
satisfied
and
i
could
produce
numerous
letters
to
that
effect

i
will
content
myself
with
one
from
the
prison
where
i
have
had
the
greatest
number
of
executions
it
is
dated
a
few
years
ago
but
it
would
be
endorsed
now
and
such
testimony
is
very
gratifying

chapter
iv
my
method
of
execution
calculations
and
apparatus
my
method
of
execution
is
the
outcome
of
the
experience
of
my
predecessors
and
myself
aided
by
suggestions
from
the
doctors
and
is
rather
the
result
of
gradual
growth
than
the
invention
of
any
one
man
the
drop
the
matter
which
requires
the
greatest
attention
in
connection
with
an
execution
is
the
allowance
of
a
suitable
drop
for
each
person
executed
and
the
adjustment
of
this
matter
is
not
nearly
so
simple
as
an
outsider
would
imagine
it
is
of
course
necessary
that
the
drop
should
be
of
sufficient
length
to
cause
instantaneous
death
that
is
to
say
to
cause
death
by
dislocation
rather
than
by
strangulation
and
on
the
other
hand
the
drop
must
not
be
so
great
as
to
outwardly
mutilate
the
victim
if
all
murderers
who
have
to
be
hanged
were
of
precisely
the
same
weight
and
build
it
would
be
very
easy
to
find
out
the
most
suitable
length
of
drop
and
always
to
give
the
same
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
vary
enormously
in
the
earliest
days
of
hanging
it
was
the
practice
for
the
executioner
to
place
his
noose
round
the
victim
neck
and
then
to
haul
upon
the
other
end
of
the
rope
which
was
passed
through
a
ring
on
the
scaffold
pole
until
the
culprit
was
strangled
without
any
drop
at
all
after
a
while
the
drop
system
was
introduced
but
the
length
of
drop
given
was
never
more
than
three
feet
so
that
death
was
still
generally
caused
by
strangulation
and
not
by
dislocation
as
it
is
at
present
one
after
another
all
our
english
executioners
followed
the
same
plan
without
thought
of
change
or
improvement
until
marwood
took
the
appointment
he
as
a
humane
man
carefully
considered
the
subject
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
then
existing
method
though
certain
was
not
so
rapid
or
painless
as
it
ought
to
be
in
consequence
he
introduced
his
system
with
a
fall
of
from
seven
to
ten
feet
which
caused
instantaneous
death
by
severance
of
the
spinal
cord
i
was
slightly
acquainted
with
marwood
before
his
death
and
i
had
gained
some
particulars
of
his
method
from
conversation
with
him
so
that
when
i
undertook
my
first
execution
at
edinburgh
i
naturally
worked
upon
his
lines
this
first
commission
was
to
execute
robert
vickers
and
william
innes
two
miners
who
were
condemned
to
death
for
the
murder
of
two
the
respective
weights
were
stone
lbs
and
stone
and
i
gave
them
drops
of
in
and
respectively
in
both
cases
death
was
instantaneous
and
the
prison
surgeon
gave
me
a
testimonial
to
the
effect
that
the
execution
was
satisfactory
in
every
respect
upon
this
experience
i
based
a
table
of
weights
and
drops
taking
a
man
of
stones
as
a
basis
and
giving
him
a
drop
of
which
is
what
i
thought
necessary
i
calculated
that
every
lighter
weight
would
require
a
two
inches
longer
drop
and
the
full
table
as
i
entered
it
in
my
books
at
the
time
stood
as
follows
stones
in
this
table
i
calculated
for
persons
of
what
i
might
call
average
build
but
it
could
not
by
any
means
be
rigidly
adhered
to
with
safety
for
instance
i
have
more
than
once
had
to
execute
persons
who
had
attempted
suicide
by
cutting
their
throats
or
who
had
been
otherwise
wounded
about
the
neck
and
to
prevent
the
wounds
i
have
reduced
the
drop
by
nearly
half
again
in
the
case
of
persons
of
very
fleshy
build
who
often
have
weak
bones
and
muscles
about
the
neck
i
have
reduced
the
drop
by
a
quarter
or
half
of
the
distance
indicated
by
the
table
if
i
had
not
done
so
no
doubt
two
or
three
of
those
whom
i
have
executed
would
have
had
their
heads
entirely
jerked
off
which
did
occur
in
one
case
to
which
i
shall
again
refer
in
the
case
of
persons
with
scrofulous
tendencies
it
is
especially
necessary
that
the
fall
should
be
unusually
short
and
in
these
cases
i
have
at
times
received
useful
hints
from
the
gaol
doctors
until
november
i
worked
to
the
scale
already
given
but
on
that
date
i
had
the
awful
experience
above
referred
to
which
caused
me
to
reconsider
the
whole
subject
and
to
construct
a
general
table
on
what
i
believe
to
be
a
truly
scientific
basis
the
experience
referred
to
is
dealt
with
in
another
chapter
the
man
with
whom
it
occurred
was
robert
goodale
whom
i
executed
at
norwich
castle
he
weighed
stones
and
the
drop
indicated
by
the
first
table
would
therefore
be
but
in
consequence
of
his
appearance
i
reduced
it
to
because
the
muscles
of
his
neck
did
not
appear
well
developed
and
strong
but
even
this
as
it
turned
out
was
not
short
enough
and
the
result
was
one
of
the
most
horrible
mishaps
that
i
have
ever
had
as
will
be
seen
from
the
full
report
of
this
case
in
another
chapter
the
coroner
exonerated
me
from
all
blame
and
testified
to
the
careful
way
in
which
i
had
done
my
work
but
i
felt
that
it
was
most
necessary
to
take
every
possible
precaution
against
the
recurrence
of
such
an
affair
i
therefore
worked
out
a
table
of
the
striking
force
of
falling
bodies
of
various
weights
falling
through
different
distances
which
table
i
give
on
page
working
with
this
i
calculate
that
an
average
man
of
any
weight
requires
a
fall
that
will
finish
with
a
striking
force
of
and
if
the
convict
seems
to
require
less
i
mentally
estimate
the
striking
force
that
is
necessary
and
then
by
referring
to
the
table
i
can
instantly
find
the
length
of
drop
required
to
see
how
this
new
table
works
out
we
may
take
the
case
of
robert
goodale
again
as
he
weighed
stones
his
striking
force
with
a
drop
of
feet
would
be
cwt
or
with
a
drop
of
feet
cwt
so
that
if
he
were
a
man
of
ordinary
build
the
drop
necessary
would
be
in
as
i
estimated
from
his
appearance
that
his
drop
ought
to
have
been
about
less
than
the
standard
i
should
have
given
him
working
on
this
new
table
about
in
instead
of
the
in
which
was
actually
given
this
is
an
extreme
case
with
a
very
heavy
man
but
all
through
the
table
it
will
be
found
that
the
drop
works
out
shorter
than
in
the
first
table
for
instance
vickers
and
innes
the
two
edinburgh
murderers
previously
referred
to
would
have
had
their
drops
reduced
from
in
and
to
in
and
respectively
if
they
had
been
treated
according
to
the
present
revised
table
on
august
at
kirkdale
gaol
liverpool
at
the
execution
of
john
conway
an
attempt
was
made
to
dictate
to
me
the
length
of
drop
and
a
most
unfortunate
scene
ensued
from
seeing
the
convict
conway
i
had
decided
that
the
drop
ought
to
be
a
little
under
the
scale
rate
and
i
was
surprised
and
annoyed
at
being
told
by
barr
acting
i
believe
under
authority
that
i
was
to
give
a
drop
of
in
i
said
that
it
would
pull
the
man
head
off
altogether
and
finally
refused
to
go
on
with
the
execution
if
such
a
long
drop
were
given
barr
then
measured
off
a
shorter
drop
some
ten
or
twelve
inches
shorter
but
still
much
longer
than
i
thought
necessary
and
i
reluctantly
agreed
to
go
on
the
result
everyone
knows
the
drop
was
not
so
long
as
to
absolutely
pull
off
the
victim
head
but
it
ruptured

i
do

who
was
really
responsible
for
the
interference
with
my
calculation
but
do
not
think
that
the
long
drop
was
barr
own
idea
as
the
drop
which
i
suggested
was
on
the
same
system
as
he
had
previously
commended
and
was
almost
identical
with
the
drop
that
would
have
worked
out
on
the
basis
of
his
own
recommendation
in
a
letter
to
the
some
years
ago
barr
letter
to
me
written
in
was
as
follows
domingo
grove
everton
liverpool
sir
in
compliance
with
your
request
i
have
pleasure
in
giving
you
a
certificate
as
to
the
manner
in
which
you
conducted
the
execution
of
peter
cassidy
in
prison
kirkdale
i
may
now
report
the
statement
which
i
gave
in
evidence
at
the
inquest
that
i
had
never
seen
an
execution
more
satisfactorily
performed
this
was
very
gratifying
to
me
your
rope
was
of
excellent
quality
fine
soft
pliable
and
strong
you
adjusted
the
ring
directed
forwards
in
the
manner
in
which
i
have
recommended
in
my
pamphlet
judicial
hanging
you
gave
a
sufficient
length
of
drop
considering
the
weight
of
the
culprit
and
completely
dislocated
the
cervical
vertebræ
between
the
atlas
and
axis
first
and
second
vertebræ
i
have
reckoned
that
the
weight
of
the
criminal
multiplied
by
the
length
of
the
drop
might
range
from
to
foot
pounds
and
i
have
calculated
that
this
in
the
case
of
cassidy
amounted
to
foot
pounds
the
pinioning
and
other
details
were
carried
out
with
due
decorum
i
hope
whoever
be
appointed
to
the
post
of
public
executioner
may
be
prohibited
from
also
performing
the
part
of
a
showman
to
gratify
a
depraved
and
morbid
public
curiosity
james
barr
medical
officer
prison
kirkdale
to
james
berry
a
few
days
after
conway
execution
i
received
a
letter
from
a
gentleman
in
the
south
of
london
shortly
followed
by
a
second
letter
and
as
they
throw
some
useful
light
upon
the
subject
i
give
them
in
full
omitting
the
writer
name
as
he
does
not
wish
it
to
be
published
the
execution
at
kirkdale
sir
as
the
accident
attending
the
execution
on
the
inst
at
kirkdale
may
be
falsely
and
very
unjustly
charged
to
your
account
and
at
the
same
time
be
brought
forward
by
a
mass
of
misguided
people
as
a
reason
for
the
total
abolition
of
capital
punishment
i
think
the
following
remarks
on
the
subject
of
hanging
may
not
be
out
of
place
some
years
ago
james
barr
medical
officer
at
kirkdale
gaol
published
a
letter
in
the
regarding
what
he
considered
the
proper
length
of
drop
he
said
that
the
length
of
drop
ought
to
be
such
as
to
produce
a
momentum
of
meaning
by
momentum
the
convict
weight
multiplied
by
the
velocity
of
his
descent
at
the
end
of
the
fall
now
in
estimating
the
convict
weight
i
conceive
that
you
ought
to
leave
out
the
weight
as
far
as
you
can
guess
it
of
his
head
because
the
weight
of
his
head
is
supported
by
the
noose
when
the
jerk
takes
place
and
therefore
can
not
affect
the
amount
of
pull
or
strain
on
the
neck
from
what
barr
says
regarding
the
lbs
momentum
it
is
easy
by
a
little
mathematics
to
deduce
the
following
rule
to
find
length
of
drop
in
feet
divide
the
number
by
the
square
of
the
convict
weight
of
body
in
stones
by
the
above
rule
i
constructed
the
following
table
weight
of
body
without
head
length
of
drop
stones
in
convict
conway
weight
you
are
reported
to
have
said
was
stones
lbs
leaving
stone
for
the
weight
of
his
head
which
is
perhaps
more
than
sufficient
his
hanging
weight
would
be
stones
lbs
so
that
a
drop
of
feet
and
a
few
inches
b
would
have
been
according
to
the
doctor
rule
quite
enough
for
him
regarding
the
value
of
the
rule
i
am
of
course
unable
to
speak
nor
do
i
know
from
what
i
remember
of
the
doctor
letter
that
he
meant
the
lbs
momentum
to
apply
in
all
cases

etc
yours
truly
y
second
letter
the
execution
at
kirkdale
sir
in
constructing
the
table
i
sent
you
two
days
ago
i
find
that
i
have
made
an
absurd
mistake
it
arose
from
my
carelessly
taking
a
stone
weight
as
instead
of
which
i
beg
you
to
allow
me
correct
instead
of
the
number
i
ought
to
have
given
the
number
the
corrected
rule
based
on
barr
momentum
of
lbs
is
therefore
as
follows
length
of
drop
in
feet
is
found
by
dividing
the
number
by
the
square
of
the
number
of
stones
in
weight
of
convict
body
exclusive
of
the
weight
of
his
head
thus
if
a
convict
weighs
stones
altogether
and
we
take
his
head
as
stone
we
have
length
of
drop
feet
in
nearly
the
table
corrected
stands
thus
weight
of
body
without
head
length
of
drop
stones
in
in
allowing
in
the
case
of
convict
conway
who
weighed
stones
stone
for
the
head
i
may
be
allowing
too
much
it
is
a
mere
guess
if
his
head
weighed
the
drop
ought
to
have
been
in
yours
truly
y
a
mistake
of
or
lbs
in
estimating
weight
of
head
makes
you
will
see
a
considerable
error
in
calculating
the
drop
it
will
be
seen
that
this
calculation
which
does
not
include
the
weight
of
the
head
in
a
man
hanging
weight
works
out
the
drop
to
a
rather
greater
length
than
my
own
table
but
the
difference
is
only
small
and
i
have
always
found
my
own
table
give
quite
sufficient
drop
the
rope
the
apparatus
for
carrying
out
the
extreme
penalty
of
the
law
is
very
simple
the
most
important
item
is
the
rope
which
must
necessarily
possess
certain
properties
if
the
death
of
the
condemned
person
is
to
be
instantaneous
and
painless
for
successful
working
the
rope
must
of
course
be
strong
and
it
must
also
be
pliable
in
order
to
tighten
freely
it
should
be
as
thin
as
possible
consistent
with
strength
in
order
that
the
noose
may
be
free
running
but
of
course
it
must
not
be
so
thin
as
to
be
liable
to
outwardly
rupture
the
blood
vessels
of
the
neck
before
undertaking
my
first
execution
i
gave
careful
consideration
to
the
question
of
the
most
suitable
class
of
rope
and
after
trying
and
examining
many
varieties
i
decided
upon
one
which
i
still
use
it
is
made
of
the
finest
italian
hemp
of
an
inch
in
thickness
before
using
a
rope
for
an
execution
i
thoroughly
test
it
with
bags
of
cement
of
about
the
weight
of
the
condemned
person
and
this
preliminary
testing
stretches
the
cord
and
at
the
same
time
reduces
its
diameter
to
of
an
inch
the
rope
consists
of
strands
each
of
which
has
a
breaking
strain
of
one
ton
dead
weight
so
that
it
would
seem
unnecessary
to
test
it
from
any
fear
of
its
proving
too
weak
but
the
stretching
and
hardening
which
it
undergoes
in
the
testing
makes
it
far
more
fit
and
satisfactory
for
its
work
than
a
new
unused
rope
would
be
it
has
been
said
that
i
use
a
rope
with
a
wire
strand
down
the
centre
but
the
notion
is
so
ridiculous
that
i
should
not
refer
to
it
if
it
were
not
that
many
people
seem
to
believe
it
and
that
more
than
once
it
has
been
stated
in
the
newspapers
a
rope
with
a
wire
strand
would
possess
no
possible
advantage
that
i
can
see
and
it
would
have
so
many
practical
disadvantages
that
i
do
not
think
anyone
who
had
studied
the
matter
would
dream
of
using
such
a
thing
at
any
rate
i
have
not
done
so
and
i
know
that
neither
binns
nor
marwood
ever
did
marwood
used
ropes
of
about
the
same
quality
and
thickness
as
my
own
while
binns
used
a
much
thicker
rope
about
inch
diameter
after
use
of
a
rougher
and
less
pliable
class
of
hemp
until
the
commencement
of
i
supplied
my
own
ropes
some
of
which
however
were
made
to
order
of
the
government
and
i
was
able
to
use
the
same
rope
again
and
again
one
i
used
for
no
less
than
sixteen
executions
and
five
others
i
have
used
for
twelve
executions
each
these
are
now
in
the
possession
of
madame
tussaud
at
the
beginning
of
a
new
rule
was
made
under
which
a
new
rope
is
ordered
to
be
supplied
and
used
for
most
of
the
executions
in
england
and
to
be
burned
together
with
the
clothes
of
the
person
executed
which
were
formerly
a
perquisite
of
the
executioner
by
the
prison
officials
immediately
after
the
execution
in
scotland
and
ireland
i
still
provide
my
own
ropes
the
rope
i
use
is
thirteen
feet
long
and
has
a
brass
ring
worked
into
one
end
through
which
the
other
end
of
the
rope
is
passed
to
form
the
noose
a
leather
washer
which
fits
the
rope
pretty
tightly
is
used
to
slip
up
behind
the
brass
ring
in
order
to
prevent
the
noose
slipping
or
slackening
after
it
has
been
adjusted
in
using
the
rope
i
always
adjust
it
with
the
ring
just
behind
the
left
ear
this
position
i
never
alter
though
of
course
if
there
were
any
special
reason
for
doing
so
for
instance
if
the
convict
had
attempted
suicide
and
were
wounded
on
the
side
of
the
throat
death
could
be
caused
by
placing
the
ring
under
the
chin
or
even
behind
the
head
the
position
behind
the
ear
however
has
distinct
advantages
and
is
the
best
calculated
to
cause
instantaneous
and
painless
death
because
it
acts
in
three
different
ways
towards
the
same
end
in
the
first
place
it
will
cause
death
by
strangulation
which
was
really
the
only
cause
of
death
in
the
old
method
of
hanging
before
the
long
drop
was
introduced
secondly
it
dislocates
the
vertebra
which
is
now
the
actual
cause
of
death
and
thirdly
if
a
third
factor
were
necessary
it
has
a
tendency
to
internally
rupture
the
jugular
vein
which
in
itself
is
sufficient
to
cause
practically
instantaneous
death
pinioning
straps
etc
the
pinioning
arrangement
like
the
rest
of
the
arrangements
for
an
execution
are
very
simple
a
broad
leathern
is
clasped
round
the
convict
waist
and
to
this
the
are
fastened
two
straps
an
inch
and
a
half
wide
with
strong
steel
buckles
clasp
the
elbows
and
fasten
them
to
the
while
another
strap
of
the
same
strength
goes
round
the
wrists
and
is
fastened
into
the
in
front
the
legs
are
pinioned
by
means
of
a
single
strap
below
the
knees
the
rest
of
the
apparatus
consists
of
a
white
cap
shaped
somewhat
like
a
bag
which
pulls
down
over
the
eyes
of
the
criminal
to
prevent
his
seeing
the
final
preparations
illustration
plan
and
elevation
of
the
drop
the
scaffold
until
recently
the
scaffolds
in
use
in
the
various
gaols
differed
very
much
in
the
details
of
their
construction
as
there
was
no
official
model
but
in
each
case
the
local
authorities
followed
their
own
idea
in
however
a
design
was
drawn
in
the
surveyors
department
of
the
home
office
by
alten
beamish
before
being
finally
adopted
the
design
was
submitted
to
me
and
it
seemed
a
thoroughly
good
one
as
indeed
it
has
since
proved
to
be
in
actual
practice
the
design
is
supplied
to
the
authorities
of
any
gaol
where
a
scaffold
is
to
be
erected
from
the
engineers
department
at
the
home
office
and
with
a
slight
alteration
has
been
the
pattern
in
general
use
to
the
present
day
the
alteration
of
which
i
speak
is
a
little
one
suggested
by
myself
and
consists
of
the
substitution
of
a
slope
or
a
level
gangway
in
place
of
the
steps
i
had
found
in
some
cases
when
the
criminals
were
nervous
or
prostrated
that
the
steps
formed
a
practical
difficulty
the
slope
or
gangway
was
approved
by
the
home
office
and
was
first
used
on
april
at
kirkdale
gaol
for
the
execution
of
wm
chadwick
it
was
a
simple
improvement
but
it
has
turned
out
to
be
a
very
useful
one
at
most
of
the
gaols
in
the
country
the
scaffold
is
taken
to
pieces
and
laid
away
immediately
after
use
but
in
newgate
wandsworth
liverpool
and
strangeways
manchester
it
is
kept
standing
permanently
the
essential
parts
of
the
scaffold
are
few
there
is
a
heavy
into
which
bolts
terminating
in
hooks
are
usually
fastened
in
some
cases
this
stands
on
two
upright
posts
but
usually
its
ends
are
let
into
the
walls
of
the
scaffold
house
of
course
the
hooks
fastened
to
it
are
intended
to
hold
the
rope
the
scaffold
proper
or
trap
or
drop
as
it
is
variously
called
is
the
portion
of
the
structure
to
which
most
importance
is
attached
and
of
which
the
government
furnishes
a
plan
it
consists
of
two
massive
oaken
doors
fixed
in
an
oak
on
a
level
with
the
floor
and
over
a
deep
bricked
pit
the
plan
and
section
will
explain
the
arrangement
the
two
doors
are
marked

on
the

is
hung
on
three
strong

has
to
be
raised
into
a
perpendicular
position
until
the
other
door
is
raised
and
its
hinges
placed
on
the
the
arrangement
is
a
very
good
one
as
both
doors
must
necessarily
fall
at
exactly
the
same
moment
their
great
weight
for
they
are
of
three
inch
oak
causes
them
to
drop
very
suddenly
even
without
the
weight
of
the
criminal
and
they
are
caught
by
spring
catches
to
prevent
any
possibility

chapter
my
method
of
execution
the
proceedings
the
hour
fixed
for
executions
is
in
all
the
prisons
except
wandsworth
and
lincoln
where
it
is
of
course
the
scaffold
and
rope
are
arranged
and
the
drop
decided
beforehand
i
calculate
for
three
minutes
to
be
occupied
from
the
time
of
entering
the
condemned
cell
to
the
finish
of
life
great
tragedy
for
the
doomed
man
so
i
enter
the
cell
punctually
at
three
minutes
to
eight
in
order
that
my
action
in
hanging
a
man
may
be
legal
it
is
necessary
that
i
should
have
what
is
known
as
an
authority
to
hang
which
is
drawn
up
and
signed
by
the
sheriff
and
handed
to
me
a
few
minutes
before
the
time
for
the
execution
its
form
varies
a
good
deal
in
some
cases
it
is
a
long
wordy
document
full
of
the
wherefores
and
whatsoevers
in
which
the
law
delights
but
usually
it
is
a
simple
form
engrossed
by
the
gaol
clerk
and
running
somewhat
as
follows
james
of
in
the
county
of
esquire

of
the
said
county

hereby
authorise
you
to

now
lies

this
day
of
this
is
folded
in
three
and
endorsed
outside
a
b
to
sheriff
when
we
enter
the
condemned
cell
the
chaplain
is
already
there
and
has
been
for
some
time
two
attendants
who
have
watched
through
the
convict
last
nights
on
earth
are
also
present
at
my
appearance
the
convict
takes
leave
of
his
attendants
to
whom
he
generally
gives
some
little
token
or
keepsake
and
i
at
once
proceed
to
pinion
his
arms
as
soon
as
the
pinioning
is
done
a
procession
is
formed
generally
in
the
following
order
chief

and

in
some
few
cases
where
the
prisoner
has
not
confessed
before
the
time
for
the
execution
i
have
approached
him
in
the
cell
in
a
kindly
manner
asking
him
as
it
can
make
no
difference
to
his
fate
to
confess
the
justice
of
the
sentence
in
order
that
i
may
feel
sure
that
i
am
not
hanging
an
innocent
person
in
most
cases
they
have
done
so
either
in
the
cell
or
at
the
last
moment
on
the
scaffold
of
course
the
confidences
reposed
in
me
at
such
moments
i
have
never
divulged
and
it
would
be
most
improper
to
do
so
but
i
am
at
liberty
to
state
that
of
all
the
people
i
have
executed
only
two
or
three
have
died
without
fully
and
freely
confessing
their
guilt
on
the
way
from
the
cell
to
the
scaffold
the
chaplain
reads
the
service
for
the
burial
of
the
dead
and
as
the
procession
moves
i
place
the
white
cap
upon
the
head
of
the
convict
just
as
we
reach
the
scaffold
i
pull
the
cap
over
his
eyes
then
i
place
the
convict
under
the
beam
pinion
the
legs
just
below
the
knees
with
a
strap
similar
to
the
one
used
for
the
elbows
adjust
the
rope
pull
the
bolt
and
the
trap
falls
death
is
instantaneous
but
the
body
is
left
hanging
for
an
hour
and
is
then
lowered
into
a
coffin
made
in
the
prison
and
carried
to
the
mortuary
to
await
the
inquest
the
inquest
usually
takes
place
at
ten
but
in
some
few
places
it
is
held
at
noon
after
the
inquest
the
body
is
surrounded
by
and
buried
in
the
prison
grounds
in
the
carrying
out
of
the
last
penalty
of
the
law
everything
is
conducted
with
decorum
and
solemnity
and
so
far
as
i
can
see
there
is
no
way
in
which
the
arrangements
at
an
execution
can
be
improved
unless
it
is
in
regard
to
the
admission
of
reporters
in
years
gone
by
a
large
number
of
reporters
were
often
admitted
some
of
them
with
probably
little
or
no
real
connection
with
the
papers
they
professed
to
represent
occasionally
also
there
would
be
one
or
two
juniors
who
seemed
to
have
no
proper
idea
of
the
solemnity
of
a
death
scene
and
whose
conduct
was
hardly
such
as
serious
persons
could
approve
the
result
has
been
that
in
many
prisons
the
admission
of
press
representatives
has
been
very
rigidly
curtailed
and
in
some
cases
admission
has
been
absolutely
refused
it
seems
to
me
that
the
admittance
of
a
large
number
of
spectators
and
the
absolute
refusal
to
admit
any
are
alike
mistakes
i
speak
in
this
matter
as
a
man
whose
own
work
comes
under
the
criticism
of
the
press
and
although
so
far
as
i
am
personally
concerned
i
am
perfectly
satisfied
if
i
can
satisfy
the
governor
or
high
sheriff
i
know
that
there
is
a
large
section
of
the
public
that
thinks
the
exclusion
of
the
reporters
must
mean
that
there
is
something
going
on
which
there
is
a
desire
to
hush
up
i
am
a
servant
of
the
public
as
also
are
the
sheriffs
the
governor
and
the
other
officials
connected
with
an
execution
and
the
public
through
its
representatives
on
the
press
ought
to
have
some
assurance
that
the
details
of
each
execution
are
carried
out
decently
and
in
order
the
presence
or
absence
of
the
press
of
course
makes
no
difference
in
the
conduct
of
the
execution
but
it
makes
a
good
deal
of
difference
to
a
certain
section
of
the
public
if
the
governor
of
the
gaol
or
the
sheriff
were
to
give
three
admissions
for
each
execution
with
the
understanding
that
any
representative
suspected
of
not
being
would
be
refused
admission
even
if
he
presented
his
ticket
i
think
that
every
real
objection
would
be
met
after
the
execution
is
over
the
fact
that
the
sentence
of
the
law
has
been
carried
out
is
announced
to
the
public
by
a
notice
fixed
to
the
door
of
the
prison
the
form

execution
from
time
to
time
people
raise
an
outcry
against
the
english
mode
of
putting
criminals
to
death
and
there
are
many
englishmen
who
have
a
firm
conviction
that
hanging
is
the
very
worst
and
most
unscientific
form
of
capital
punishment
the
prejudices
of
these
people
seem
to
be
based
on
an
utterly
wrong
idea
of
how
an
english
execution
is
conducted
and
i
hope
that
the
chapter
dealing
with
my
method
will
form
the
basis
for
a
truer
judgment

of
methods
of
execution
that
have
been
suggested
as
substitutes
for
hanging
there
are
some
which
hardly
deserve
consideration
because
there
is
no
considerable
number
of
people
who
would
approve
of
them
the
various
methods
of
beheading
are
hardly
likely
to
be
ever
in
favour
with
englishmen
generally
for
they
want
executions
to
be
as
free
as
possible
from
revolting
details
the
old
headsman
axe
and
block
which
are
still
to
be
seen
in
the
tower
are
in
themselves
sufficient
argument
against
a
revival
of
their
use
apart
from
the
fact
that
beheading
under
the
best
conditions
is
revolting
we
must
further
consider
that
from
the
very
nature
of
the
office
the
executioner
who
has
to
hack
off
his
victim
head
must
be
a
brutal
and
degraded
man
and
the
chances
are
that
he
will
not
be
so
skilful
or
so
careful
as
he
ought
to
be
for
the
performance
of
such
a
task
even
amongst
races
which
are
not
so
highly
civilised
as
the
english
and
where
it
is
easier
to
obtain
headsmen
of
proportionately
better
standing
we
occasionally
hear
of
more
than
one
blow
being
required
to
cause
death
and
such
a
state
of
things
is
very
horrible
in
china
decapitation
has
been
reduced
to
almost
a
science
and
the
chinese
executioners
are
probably
the
most
skilful
headsmen
in
the
world
i
have
in
my
possession
a
chinese
executioner
knife
with
which
the
heads
of
nine
pirates
were
severed
in
nine
successive
blows
and
a
terrible
knife
it
is
and
well
fitted
for
the
purpose
yet
even
with
such
a
weapon
and
with
the
skill
and
experience
which
chinese
executioners
attain
from
frequent
practice
the
blow
sometimes
fails
as
was
the
case
in
one
of
the
last
batch
of
chinese
executions
reported
in
the
english
newspapers

even
the
guillotine
which
is
often
spoken
of
as
the
only
perfect
and
certain
method
has
been
known
to
fail
and
we
have
cases
in
which
the
knife
has
been
raised
and
dropped
a
second
time
before
causing
death
in
any
case
whether
the
guillotine
the
axe
or
the
chinese
knife
is
used
and
whatever
care
may
be
taken
to
render
the
death
painless
and
instantaneous
there
is
a
horrible
mutilation
of
the
sufferer
that
must
be
revolting
to
all
sensitive
people

the
spanish
and
method
of
execution
by
means
of
the
garotte
has
been
much
praised
by
some
advocates
of
reform
the
prisoner
to
be
garotted
is
placed
in
a
chair
to
the
back
of
which
an
iron
collar
is
attached
in
such
a
manner
that
it
can
be
drawn
partly
through
the
by
means
of
a
heavily
weighted
lever
when
the
lever
and
weight
are
raised
the
head
can
be
passed
through
the
collar
and
by
dropping
the
weight
the
collar
is
drawn
tight
and
causes
strangulation
this
method
is
certain
but
i
do
not
consider
it
so
good
as
the
present
english
system
of
hanging
because
death
by
strangulation
is
much
slower
and
more
painful
than
death
by
dislocation
in
one
form
of
the
garotting
chair
this
fact
has
been
recognised
and
an
iron
spike
is
placed
immediately
behind
the
neck
so
that
when
the
pressure
is
applied
the
spike
enters
between
two
of
the
vertebræ
and
severs
the
spinal
cord
this
i
consider
worse
than
our
own
system
because
the
iron
spike
must
cause
a
certain
amount
of
bleeding
which
the
english
method
avoids
illustration
the
garotte
the
american
system
of
hanging
which
has
been
recently
superseded
by
electrocution
was
but
a
slight
modification
of
the
ancient
system
of
jack
ketch
or
the
method
of
judge
lynch
in
these
older
systems
the
convict
stood
upon
the
ground
while
the
rope
was
placed
round
his
neck
and
the
other
end
passed
over
the
arm
of
the
gallows
or
the
limb
of
a
tree
then
the
executioner
and
his
assistants
hauled
on
the
other
end
of
the
rope
until
the
victim
was
swung
clear
off
the
ground
and
was
gradually
strangled
in
the
improved
american
method
the
place
of
the
executioner
was
taken
by
a
heavy
weight
which
was
attached
to
the
rope
and
which
rapidly
ran
up
the
convict
to
a
height
of
some
feet
in
some
few
very
extreme
cases
of
heavy
bodies
with
frail
necks
this
may
have
caused

but
as
a
rule
strangulation

be

cause

death
illustration
old
methods
when
the
use
of
electricity
for
executions
began
to
be
talked
of
as
a
practical
possibility
i
naturally
took
much
interest
in
the
subject
as
the
result
of
all
the
enquiries
i
was
enabled
to
make
i
concluded
that
although
electrocution
as
the
americans
call
it
is
theoretically
perfect
it
presents
many
practical
difficulties
the
experience
of
the
authorities
in
the
case
of
the
wretched
man
kremmler
who
was
executed
by
electricity
in
new
york
fully
proves
that
as
yet
we
do
not
know
enough
about
the
conditions
under
which
electricity
will
cause
painless
and
sudden
death
when
particulars
of
the
method
that
was
to
be
adopted
for
executions
in
new
york
were
first
published
i
was
with
a
small
committee
of
gentlemen
in
manchester
who
were
investigating
the
subject
they
made
all
arrangements
for
experiments
to
test
the
reliability
of
the
method
two
animals
were
obtained
that
had
to
be
killed
in
any
case
namely
a
calf
and
an
old
dog
of
a
large
breed
in
the
case
of
the
calf
the
connections
were
made
in
the
manner
prescribed
and
the
current
was
turned
on
this
was
repeated
twice
but
the
only
result
was
to
cause
the
calf
to
drop
on
its
knees
and
bellow
with
fear
and
pain
and
the
butcher
at
once
killed
it
in
the
ordinary
way
with
his
poleaxe
when
the
shock
was
applied
to
the
dog
he
fell
down
and
seemed
to
be
paralysed
but
it
was
some
time
before
life
was
extinct
the
latest
reports
of
american
executions
say
that
the
deaths
were
instantaneous
and
painless
but
the
value
of
such
statements
is
lessened
by
the
fact
of
reporters
being
excluded
the
total
exclusion
of
the
press
at
any
rate
seemed
like
an
admission
of
the
authorities
that
they
had
no
confidence
in
the
certainty
of
the
method
they
were
using
altogether
after
a
careful
consideration
of
all
the
principal
modes
of
execution
i
am
convinced
that
our
english
method
as
at
present
in
use
is
the
best
yet
known
because
it
is
absolutely
certain
instantaneous
and
painless
it
may
be

chapter
vii
two
terrible
experiences
the
whole
of
the
duties
of
an
executioner
are
unpleasant
but
there
are
exceptional
incidents
occurring
at
times
which
stand
out
upon
the
tablet
of
one
memory
and
which
can
not
be
recalled
without
an
involuntary
shudder
i
have
had
two
of
these
experiences
and
as
people
should
always
learn
by
their
failures
have
turned
them
to
practical
account
as
lessons
for
the
future
the
first
was
the
attempted
execution
of
john
lee
which
resulted
in
the
home
office
making
an
investigation
into
the
arrangements
for
executions
in
the
different
gaols
and
eventually
to
their
issuing
an
official
plan
for
the
drop
which
has
been
used
in
all
prisons
where
scaffolds
have
since
been
erected
the
second
of
these
experiences
was
at
the
execution
of
robert
goodale
when
the
length
of
the
drop
caused
the
head
to
be
severed
from
the
body
this
taught
me
that
the
system
then
in
use
and
introduced
by
marwood
was
faulty
in
some
cases
and
caused
me
to
work
out
my
present
table
of
lengths
of
drop
as
explained
in
the
chapter
on
my
method
of
execution
there
are
so
many
erroneous
ideas
afloat
about
the
details
of
these
two
cases
that
i
think
a
good
purpose
may
be
served
by
giving
the
actual
particulars
especially
as
no
true
explanation
has
ever
been
published
of
the
difficulty
which
occurred
in
the
case
of
lee
lee
was
found
guilty
of
the
murder
of
miss
keyse
in
whose
house
at
babbacombe
he
was
employed
as
a
servant
eight
on
monday
february
was
the
time
fixed
for
his
execution
the
scaffold
and
its
arrangements
had
not
been
used
for
a
previous
execution
in
their
then
position
though
the
drop
had
been
used
once
for
the
execution
of
mrs
took
but
it
was
then
fixed
in
another
place
on
the
saturday
i
examined
this
drop
and
reported
that
it
was
much
too
frail
for
its
purpose
but
i
worked
the
lever
and
found
that
the
doors
dropped
all
right
on
the
monday
morning
at
the
appointed
time
i
brought
out
the
prisoner
in
the
usual
way
pinioned
him
and
adjusted
the
noose
he
was
perfectly
calm
almost
indifferent
when
the
noose
was
adjusted
i
stood
back
and
pulled
over
the
lever
the
noise
of
the
bolts
sliding
could
be
plainly
heard
but
the
doors
did
not
fall
i
stamped
on
the
drop
to
shake
it
loose
and
so
did
some
of
the
warders
but
none
of
our
efforts
could
stir
it
lee
stood
like
a
statue
making
no
sound
or
sign
as
soon
as
we
found
our
efforts
useless
we
led
the
condemned
man
away
we
tried
the
doors
which
fell
easily
then
lee
was
placed
in
position
again
and
again
the
doors
refused
to
fall
then
the
prisoner
was
taken
away
and
eventually
his
sentence
was
commuted
perhaps
it
would
be
well
to
state
here
that
the
report
to
the
effect
that
lee
has
been
since
executed
and
another
report
to
the
effect
that
he
has
been
liberated
are
both
equally
false
for
he
is
still
in
prison
various
reasons
were
given
to
account
for
the
failure
of
the
workings
but
it
was
most
generally
believed
that
it
was
caused
by
the
doors
being
swollen
with
the
rain
which
fell
on
the
sunday
night
that
this
was
not
the
cause
is
proved
firstly
by
the
fact
that
the
doors
fell
all
right
when
the
weight
of
the
prisoner
was
not
on
them
and
secondly
by
the
fact
that
they
would
not
fall
with
the
prisoner
on
them
even
when
we
had
chopped
and
planed
down
the
sides
where
it
was
supposed
that
they
stuck
the
governor
of
the
gaol
and
the
who
were
present
were
terribly
upset
about
the
failure
of
the
attempted
execution
and
the
prolonged
and
terrible
suspense
in
which
the
prisoner
was
kept
they
were
almost
frantic
about
it
but
nothing
could
be
done
in
the
matter
the
asked
me
to
write
out
a
brief
statement
of
the
facts
together
with
my
opinion
of
the
cause
of
the
difficulty
and
i
give
a
copy
of
my
letter
below

in

with
the
request
contained
in

of
the
i
beg
to
say
that
on
the
morning
of
friday
the
i
travelled
from
bradford
to
bristol
and
on
the
morning
of
saturday
the
from
bristol
to
exeter
arriving
at
exeter
at
when
i
walked
direct
to
the
county
gaol
signed
my
name
in
your
gaol
register
book
at
exactly
i
was
shown
to
the
governor
office
and
arranged
with
him
that
i
would
go
and
dine
and
return
to
the
gaol
at
i
accordingly
left
the
gaol
partook
of
dinner
and
returned
at
when
i
was
shown
to
the
bedroom
allotted
to
me
which
was
an
officer
room
in
the
new
hospital
ward
shortly
afterwards
i
made
an
inspection
of
the
place
of
execution
the
execution
was
to
take
place
in
a
in
which
the
prison
van
was
usually
kept
two
warders
accompanied
me
on
the
inspection
in
the
i
found
a
beam
about
four
inches
thick
and
about
a
foot
in
depth
was
placed
across
the
top
of
the
through
this
beam
an
iron
bolt
was
fastened
with
an
iron
nut
on
the
upper
side
and
to
this
bolt
a
rod
was
fixed
about
of
a
yard
long
with
a
hole
at
the
lower
end
to
which
the
rope
was
to
be
attached
two
were
placed
in
the
floor
of
the
which
is
flagged
with
stone
and
these
doors
cover
a
pit
about
yards
by
yards
across
and
about
feet
deep
on
inspecting
these
doors
i
found
they
were
only
about
an
inch
thick
but
to
have
been
constructed
properly
should
have
been
three
or
four
inches
thick
the
ironwork
of
the
doors
was
of
a
frail
kind
and
much
too
weak
for
the
purpose
there
was
a
lever
to
these
doors
and
it
was
placed
near
the
top
of
them
i
pulled
the
lever
and
the
doors
dropped
the
catches
acting
all
right
i
had
the
doors
raised
and
tried
the
lever
a
second
time
when
the
catch
again
acted
all
right
the
governor
was
watching
me
through
the
window
of
his
office
and
saw
me
try
the
doors
after
the
examination
i
went
to
him
explained
how
i
found
the
doors
and
suggested
to
him
that
for
future
executions
new
should
be
made
about
three
times
as
thick
as
those
then
fixed
i
also
suggested
that
a
spring
should
be
fixed
in
the
wall
to
hold
the
doors
back
when
they
fell
so
that
no
rebounding
occurred
and
that
the
ironwork
of
the
doors
should
be
stronger
the
governor
said
he
would
see
to
these
matters
in
future
i
spent
all
the
sunday
in
the
room
allotted
to
me
and
did
not
go
outside
the
gaol
i
retired
to
bed
about
that
night
the
execution
was
fixed
to
take
place
at
eight
on
the
morning
of
monday
the
ultimo
on
the
monday
morning
i
arose
at
and
was
conducted
from
the
bedroom
by
a
warder
at
to
the
place
of
execution
everything
appeared
to
be
as
i
had
left
it
on
the
saturday
afternoon
i
fixed
the
rope
in
my
ordinary
manner
and
placed
everything
in
readiness
i
did
not
try
the
as
they
appeared
to
be
just
as
i
had
left
them
it
had
rained
heavily
during
the
nights
of
saturday
and
sunday
about
four
minutes
to
eight
i
was
conducted
by
the
governor
to
the
condemned
cell
and
introduced
to
john
lee
i
proceeded
at
once
to
pinion
him
which
was
done
in
the
usual
manner
and
then
gave
a
signal
to
the
governor
that
i
was
ready
the
procession
was
formed
headed
by
the
governor
the
chief
warder
and
the
chaplain
followed
by
lee
i
walked
behind
lee
and
or
warders
came
after
me
on
reaching
the
place
of
execution
i
found
you
were
there
with
the
prison
surgeon
lee
was
at
once
placed
upon
the
i
pinioned
his
legs
pulled
down
the
white
cap
adjusted
the
rope
stepped
on
one
side
and
drew
the
lever
but
the
did
not
fall
i
had
previously
stood
upon
the
doors
and
thought
they
would
fall
quite
easily
i
unloosed
the
strap
from
his
legs
took
the
rope
from
his
neck
removed
the
white
cap
and
took
lee
away
into
an
adjoining
room
until
i
made
an
examination
of
the
doors
i
worked
the
lever
after
lee
had
been
taken
off
drew
it
and
the
doors
fell
easily
with
the
assistance
of
the
warders
the
doors
were
pulled
up
and
the
lever
drawn
a
second
time
when
the
doors
again
fell
easily
lee
was
then
brought
from
the
adjoining
room
placed
in
position
the
cap
and
rope
adjusted
but
when
i
again
pulled
the
lever
it
did
not
act
and
in
trying
to
force
it
the
lever
was
slightly
strained
lee
was
then
taken
off
a
second
time
and
conducted
to
the
adjoining
room
it
was
suggested
to
me
that
the
woodwork
fitted
too
tightly
in
the
centre
of
the
doors
and
one
of
the
warders
fetched
an
axe
and
another
a
plane
i
again
tried
the
lever
but
it
did
not
act
a
piece
of
wood
was
then
sawn
off
one
of
the
doors
close
to
where
the
iron
catches
were
and
by
the
aid
of
an
iron
crowbar
the
catches
were
knocked
off
and
the
doors
fell
down
you
then
gave
orders
that
the
execution
should
not
be
proceeded
with
until
you
had
communicated
with
the
home
secretary
and
lee
was
taken
back
to
the
condemned
cell
i
am
of
opinion
that
the
ironwork
catches
of
the
were
not
strong
enough
for
the
purpose
that
the
woodwork
of
the
doors
should
have
been
about
three
or
four
times
as
heavy
and
with
to
correspond
so
that
when
a
man
of
lee
weight
was
placed
upon
the
doors
the
iron
catches
would
not
have
become
locked
as
i
feel
sure
they
did
on
this
occasion
but
would
respond
readily
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
everything
was
performed
in
a
careful
manner
and
had
the
iron
and
woodwork
been
sufficiently
strong
the
execution
would
have
been
satisfactorily
accomplished
i
am
sir
your
obedient
servant
james
berry
henry
james
of
devon
the
close
exeter
the
other
miserable
experience
which
lingers
in
my
memory
was
as
before
stated
the
execution
of
robert
goodale
he
was
condemned
to
death
for
the
murder
of
his
wife
and
on
november
i
was
at
norwich
castle
to
conduct
the
execution
at
that
time
i
was
working
with
my
original
table
of
lengths
of
drop
which
i
had
based
upon
marwood
system
this
table
and
some
particulars
of
goodale
case
or
rather
of
the
new
calculations
which
i
made
in
consequence
of
the
lesson
then
learned
will
be
found
in
the
chapter
on
my
method
of
execution
he
weighed
fifteen
stones
and
the
calculated
drop
for
a
man
of
that
weight
according
to
the
old
table
was
in
as
goodale
did
not
seem
very
muscular
i
reduced
the
drop
by
about
two
feet
in
fact
as
closely
as
i
could
measure
it
to
in
the
rope
that
i
used
was
one
made
and
supplied
by
the
government
and
i
had
used
it
seven
days
previously
for
the
execution
of
john
williams
at
hereford
the
drop
was
built
on
a
plan
supplied
by
the
government
and
had
been
used
before
in
fact
everything
was
in
perfect
working
order
the
governor
of
the
gaol
had
been
specially
anxious
that
everything
should
be
right
and
had
taken
all
possible
precautions
to
avoid
a
hitch
he
had
personally
tested
the
drop
on
the
thursday
morning
before
and
on
the
saturday
had
again
tested
it
in
company
with
an
engineer
the
whole
of
the
arrangements
were
carried
out
in
the
usual
manner
and
when
i
pulled
the
lever
the
drop
fell
properly
and
the
prisoner
dropped
out
of
sight
we
were
horrified
however
to
see
that
the
rope
jerked
upwards
and
for
an
instant
i
thought
that
the
noose
had
slipped
from
the
culprit
head
or
that
the
rope
had
broken
but
it
was
worse
than
that
for
the
jerk
had
severed
the
head
entirely
from
the
body
and
both
had
fallen
together
to
the
bottom
of
the
pit
of
course
death
was
instantaneous
so
that
the
poor
fellow
had
not
suffered
in
any
way
but
it
was
terrible
to
think
that
such
a
revolting
thing
should
have
occurred
we
were
all
unnerved
and
shocked
the
governor
whose
efforts
to
prevent
any
accident
had
kept
his
nerves
at
full
strain
fairly
broke
down
and
wept
the
inquest
was
a
trying
ordeal
for
all
concerned
and
it
was
a
great
comfort
to
me
to
find
that
the
governor
and
the
gaol
surgeon
both
gave
evidence
as
to
the
care
with
which
every
detail
had
been
carried
out
in
the
evidence
i
mentioned
that
i
had
hanged
one
heavier
man
previously
namely
joseph
lawson
who
weighed
stones
and
to
whom
i
gave
a
drop
of
feet
in
his
case
there
was
not
even
abrasion
of
the
skin
of
the
neck
when
i
finished
my
evidence
the
coroner
said
i
am
bound
to
say
before
you
leave
the
room
that
as
far
as
the
evidence
has
gone
there
seems
to
be
nothing
to
throw
any
blame
upon
you
either
from
want
of
skill
or
being
in
an
improper
condition
after
this
the
evidence
of
the
gaol
surgeon
was
taken
and
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
to
the
effect
that
robert
goodale
came
to
his
death
by
hanging
according
to
the
judgment
of
the
law
and
that
no
one
was
to
blame
for
what
had
occurred
in
the
foregoing
i
have
spoken
of
terrible
experiences
and
some
of
my
readers
with
the
execution
of
conway
at
kirkdale
fresh
in
their
memories
will
ask
why
it
is
not
mentioned
the
fact
is
the
foregoing
was
written
before
conway
execution
took
place
and
as
the
mishap
which
occurred
on
that
occasion
was
in
no
way
due
to
my
own
ignorance
or
carelessness
but
was
exactly
what
i
expected
would
happen
in
consequence
of
my
arrangements
being
interfered
with
by
others
the
shock
that
i
received
was
by
no
means
so
great
as
on
the
two
other
occasions
particulars
of
this
execution
will
be
found
in
the
section
headed
the
drop
of
the
chapter
on
my
method
of
execution
chapter
viii
how
murderers
die
as
one
of
my
objects
in
writing
this
book
is
to
give
the
public
a
solid
basis
for
the
formation
of
a
sound
public
opinion
upon
the
subject
of
capital
punishment
it
is
necessary
that
the
present
chapter
should
be
a
long
one
and
that
many
of
its
details
should
be
painful
because
they
are
true
if
i
glossed
over
the
facts
i
should
signally
fail
in
my
duty
to
my
readers
but
i
have
endeavoured
so
far
as
possible
to
avoid
revolting
details
to
the
ordinary
englishman
a
murderer
is
a
murderer
and
nothing
else
he
is
a
vile
creature
who
has
taken
life
and
who
by
law
divine
and
national
must
die
because
of
his
deed
he
is
a
creature
different
from
the
rest
of
humanity
a
fiend
a
monster
who
has
outraged
justice
and
must
die
like
a
dog
to
me
a
murderer
is
a
study
he
is
a
man
who
has
done
an
ill
deed
who
may
or
may
not
be
naturally
vicious
who
may
or
may
not
be
really
responsible
for
his
actions
who
may
or
may
not
be
devoutly
penitent
my
own
ideas
on
capital
punishment
are
given
in
another
chapter
i
believe
honestly
and
from
long
study
of
the
subject
with
unique
opportunities
of
judging
that
with
a
certain
low
class
of
the
human
brute
the
fear
of
death
is
the
only
check
that
can
in
any
way
curb
their
lusts
and
passions
but
i
have
sometimes
thought
that
amongst
those
whom
i
have
executed
for
crimes
which
they
have
undoubtedly
committed
there
were
men
to
whom
their
crime
was
a
trouble
more
terrible
than
death
men
who
had
not
premeditated
murder
who
had
taken
no
pleasure
in
it
and
expected
no
profit
from
it
and
who
if
they
could
by
any
means
have
been
set
at
liberty
had
within
them
the
making
of
model
citizens
logically
and
as
a
matter
of
conviction
i
feel
that
if
one
sheddeth
man
blood
by
man
should
his
blood
be
shed
but
as
a
matter
of
sentiment
i
sometimes
feel
sorry
that
certain
murderers
can
not
go
free
the
power
of
reprieve
is
of
course
often
exercised
and
very
rightly
so
and
yet
it
sometimes
seems
as
if
murderers
who
have
been
wilful
deliberate
and
thoroughly
vicious
in
their
acts
and
characters
are
reprieved
because
they
possess
interesting
personalities
or
influential
friends
while
others
are
executed
who
have
a
better
plea
for
mercy
but
no
one
to
present
it
the
whole
subject
is
a
very
difficult
one
i
must
lay
the
facts
before
my
readers
and
let
them
draw
their
own
conclusions
but
i
may
say
that
the
executions
which
have
given
me
the
most
trouble
have
not
been
those
in
which
the
convicts
were
violent
or
hysterical
not
those
in
which
they
struggled
and
fought
and
cursed
or
doggedly
and
stubbornly
resisted
but
the
few
cases
in
which
they
have
been
devoutly
penitent
and
almost
seemed
to
welcome
death
as
a
release
from
a
burden
too
heavy
to
be
borne
and
an
expiation
for
the
sin
which
they
deplored
in
such
cases
the
executioner
task
is
indeed
a
painful
one
the
conduct
of
the
condemned
in
the
cell
and
on
the
scaffold
throws
much
light
upon
the
various
phases
of
human
character
and
to
me
it
has
always
been
an
interesting
study
vickers
and
william
the
first
two
men
whom
i
executed
though
strong
chums
and
partners
in
crime
were
totally
different
from
each
other
in
their
conduct
they
both
showed
deep
emotion
although
they
belonged
to
a
low
type
of
humanity
and
they
both
attentively
listened
to
the
chaplain
as
often
as
he
was
willing
to
visit
them
and
to
such
outside
ministers
as
took
any
interest
in
their
fate
but
i
believe
they
did
this
with
the
view
of
making
the
best
of
a
bad
job
if
any
best
were
possible
rather
than
from
any
deep
conviction
of
the
sinfulness
of
their
offence
beyond
this
their
demeanour
was
totally
different
vickers
was
buoyed
up
with
hope
throughout
and
continually
asked
if
the
reprieve
had
come
even
when
i
was
introduced
to
him
on
the
morning
of
the
execution
he
had
not
despaired
and
his
hope
rendered
him
almost
cheerful
even
when
we
were
on
the
scaffold
he
was
convinced
that
he
was
not
to
die
and
seemed
to
listen
as
people
on
the
scaffold
did
in
olden
times
for
the
horseman
wildly
dashing
across
the
and
crying
reprieve
reprieve
at
the
very
last
moment
it
was
not
until
the
noose
touched
his
neck
that
he
realised
that
his
execution
was
to
be
an
actual
solemn
fact
and
when
the
dread
reality
burst
upon
him
he
fainted
his
companion
in
crime
and
death
stood
unmoved
upon
the
scaffold
resigned
and
calm
without
either
hope
or
fear
the
white
cap
was
over
his
face
when
vickers
fainted
and
no
sound
from
the
bystanders
gave
him
any
hint
that
vickers
was
overcome
the
fainting
man
was
supported
for
a
moment
then
a
touch
on
the
lever
and
it
was
necessary
to
support
him
no
longer
the
gorebridge
murder
for
which
these
men
were
executed
caused
a
great
sensation
at
the
time
illustration
mary
lefley
my
next
execution
in
which
the
condemned
person
was
a
woman
was
a
very
different
experience
mary
lefley
the
culprit
was
before
her
marriage
a
companion
of
priscilla
biggadike
who
was
executed
at
lincoln
for
poisoning
her
husband
mary
lefley
committed
the
same
crime
poisoning
her
husband
by
inserting
arsenic
in
a
rice
pudding
after
the
sentence
of
death
even
up
to
the
time
of
the
execution
she
expected
a
reprieve
and
to
the
last
she
protested
her
innocence
though
on
the
night
before
she
was
very
restless
and
constantly
exclaimed
lord
thou
knowest
all
and
prayed
fervently
she
would
have
no
breakfast
and
when
i
approached
her
she
was
in
a
nervous
agitated
state
praying
to
god
for
salvation
not
as
a
murderess
but
as
an
innocent
woman
on
my
approach
she
threw
up
her
hands
and
shrieked
murder
murder
and
she
had
to
be
led
to
the
scaffold
by
two
female
warders
shrieking
wildly
all
the
time
she
died
as
she
had
lived
impenitent
and
untruthful
denying
her
guilt
to
the
last
the
principal
actor
in
the
butterknowle
tragedy
when
sergeant
smith
was
murdered
was
a
terrible
combination
of
craven
fear
and
reckless
bravado
during
the
last
few
days
of
his
life
he
was
dull
and
despondent
and
during
the
night
before
his
execution
his
sleep
was
frequently
broken
by
fits
of
terror
and
nervous
exhaustion
when
he
shivered
like
one
in
an
ague
on
the
morning
of
the
last
day
he
arose
at
six
and
tried
to
appear
cheerful
or
even
jovial
in
the
he
saluted
the
warders
with
a
cheerful
good
morning
and
on
his
way
to
the
scaffold
laughed
hilariously
at
a
stumble
of
his
own
then
he
commenced
using
foul
blasphemous
language
and
not
ceasing
even
when
the
white
cap
was
drawn
over
his
face
his
oaths
drowned
the
voice
of
the
chaplain
who
was
reading
the
usual
burial
service
and
with
awful
words
on
his
lips
he
was
launched
into
a
dark
eternity
my
very
next
case
was
a
strong
contrast
to
the
foregoing
the
condemned
man
was
peter
cassidy
his
offence
it
was
one
of
those
cases
in
which
it
is
difficult
to
know
whether
the
man
should
be
most
pitied
or
blamed
whether
he
was
not
more
sinned
against
than
sinning
that
he
committed
the
murder
in
a
fit
of
drunken
frenzy
was
undoubted
he
did
not
deny
it
but
that
he
had
received
great
and
frequent
provocation
is
certain
both
he
and
his
wife
were
addicted
to
drink
which
was
most
to
blame
for
it
i
do
not
know
but
on
the
day
of
the
murder
his
wife
was
away
from
home
for
some
time
without
his
consent
or
knowledge
of
her
whereabouts
when
she
returned
she
was
drunk
so
was
he
and
in
the
quarrel
that
ensued
he
slew
her
but
when
he
was
sober
again
his
remorse
was
as
deep
as
his
drunken
passion
had
been
violent
he
realised
the
gravity
of
his
offence
and
the
justice
of
his
death
sentence
to
the
ministrations
of
the
rev
father
bonté
the
roman
catholic
chaplain
he
paid
great
attention
and
on
his
last
day
on
earth
he
seemed
peaceful
and
resigned
he
walked
to
the
scaffold
with
a
free
firm
stride
the
morning
was
dark
and
gloomy
but
just
as
we
passed
across
the
prison
yard
a
thin
bright
gleam
of
sunlight
pierced
the
leaden
clouds
and
rested
for
a
moment
upon
the
little
procession
in
that
moment
of
sunshine
cassidy
breathed
convulsively
but
the
sky
clouded
over
almost
instantly
and
he
regained
his
composure
on
the
scaffold
he
entered
into
the
roman
catholic
service
which
father
bonté
was
reading
repeating
the
responses
firmly
and
fervently
in
fact
he
was
so
engrossed
in
the
service
that
i
do
not
think
he
knew
that
i
pinioned
his
legs
he
continued
his
prayers
as
i
adjusted
the
white
cap
over
his
eyes
but
when
the
rope
touched
his
neck
he
blushed
crimson
to
the
very
roots
of
his
hair
and
his
lips
twitched
intense
shame
and
sorrow
were
never
more
plainly
expressed
by
any
man
a
very
large
proportion
of
murders
are
directly
traceable
to
drink
and
in
almost
every
case
where
a
murderer
has
said
anything
about
the
motive
for
his
crime
he
has
blamed
the
drinking
habit

shrimpton
as
a
rule
it
is
the
first
offender
there
are
many
murderers
whose
great
crime
is
their
first
offence
who
is
most
affected
by
the
terrible
nature
of
his
position
when
condemned
to
death
the
old
and
practised
criminal
though
he
has
a
great
dread
of
the
scaffold
and
the
rope
so
long
as
he
is
at
large
and
though
he
usually
takes
more
interest
in
his
trial
and
uses
greater
efforts
for
his
acquittal
than
the
novice
in
crime
is
usually
resigned
and
indifferent
as
soon
as
the
sentence
is
passed
as
a
rule
he
pays
but
little
heed
to
the
ministrations
of
the
chaplain
or
the
condolences
of
his
friends
he
is
neither
piously
inclined
nor
hysterically
fearful
nor
abusively
rebellious
he
simply
waits
his
fate
a
kind
of
hard
stoicism
seems
to
keep
him
quiet
he
has
played
a
desperate
game
with
his
eyes
open
has
played
for
high
stakes
and
lost
i
say
that
this
is
generally
the
case
with
the
and
yet
there
are
exceptions
and
amongst
such
exceptions
in
my
own
experience
moses
shrimpton
was
notable
his
life
almost
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
was
one
long
career
of
crime
and
punishment
he
was
a
man
of
strong
character
and
much
determination
of
purpose
a
leader
amongst
the
ruffians
of
his
district
he
was
sentenced
to
one
month
imprisonment
for
poaching
in
february
and
from
that
time
until
his
execution
in
may
he
was
seldom
out
of
prison
for
many
months
together
he
gloried
in
his
success
as
a
poacher
and
told
the
tales
of
his
desperate
adventures
in
a
most
interesting
manner
to
the
warders
in
worcester
gaol
where
he
was
a
and
frequent
inmate
he
was
sentenced
to
death
for
the
violent
and
brutal
murder
of
a
policeman
who
arrested
him
when
he
expressed
no
surprise
or
sentiment
of
any
kind
when
he
found
that
he
was
condemned
to
death
but
to
the
astonishment
of
all
who
knew
him
he
appeared
to
be
entirely
changed
in
character
by
the
thought
of
death
those
who
administered
spiritual
consolation
to
him
during
his
last
three
weeks
of
life
were
persuaded
that
his
repentance
and
amendment
were
real
and
certainly
his
actions
appeared
like
those
of
a
man
who
was
really
convinced
he
paid
great
attention
to
the
chaplain
who
visited
him
and
he
read
the
bible
hour
after
hour
certain
passages
that
puzzled
him
he
carefully
noted
down
and
asked
for
an
explanation
at
the
chaplain
next
visit
when
the
time
for
his
execution
came
he
was
confident
almost
defiant
and
walked
to
the
scaffold
erect
and
firm
as
he
stepped
on
to
the
drop
he
glanced
downwards
and
drew
his
feet
together
to
assist
me
in
fixing
the
strap
that
pinioned
his
legs
before
i
pulled
down
the
white
cap
he
looked
around
as
if
to
see
the
last
of
the
world
and
then
nodding
to
signify
that
he
was
ready
awaited
the
adjusting
of
the
noose
martin
and
some
more
ordinary
examples
of
the
deaths
of
hardened
criminals
were
presented
in
the
cases
of
rudge
martin
and
baker
it
will
be
remembered
that
these
men
committed
a
jewel
robbery
at
netherby
in
cumberland
and
afterwards
murdered
byrnes
and
made
a
murderous
attack
on
other
policemen
while
endeavouring
to
escape
arrest
these
men
when
once
their
sentence
was
passed
had
no
further
interest
in
life
and
i
believe
that
if
the
choice
could
have
been
offered
to
them
they
would
have
preferred
to
walk
straight
from
the
dock
to
the
scaffold
rather
than
to
have
had
the
three
weeks
grace
which
is
given
to
condemned
men
in
the
case
of
almost
all
habitual
criminals
i
believe
this
is
so
they
do
not
fear
death
and
they
do
not
repent
of
their
crime
so
long
as
there
is
a
ghost
of
a
chance
of
acquittal
or
reprieve
they
cling
to
life
but
as
soon
as
the
death
sentence
is
passed
they
become
indifferent
and
would
like
to
get
it
over
as
soon
as
possible
mainly
because
the
prison
life
bores
them
of
the
three
men
i
have
instanced
rudge
was
the
only
one
who
seemed
to
care
to
take
any
interest
in
life
he
spent
a
good
deal
of
his
time
in
writing
a
statement
of
his
views
upon
the
present
system
of
penal
servitude
for
the
information
of
the
home
office
as
he
had
undergone
two
long
sentences
he
knew
his
subject
thoroughly
from
the
inside
with
his
attendants
he
talked
freely
both
about
himself
and
about
other
matters
of
interest
he
insisted
that
there
was
something
wrong
with
his
head
which
had
caused
him
trouble
several
times
in
his
life
he
did
not
ask
for
any
reprieve
on
this
account
but
he
begged
the
prison
chaplain
to
examine
his
brain
after
death
and
repeated
the
request
almost
the
last
thing
before
the
time
for
the
execution
martin
and
baker
spent
most
of
the
three
weeks
in
bed
they
would
neither
talk
nor
do
anything
else
rudge
and
martin
were
baptised
roman
catholics
whilst
baker
had
received
some
protestant
education
but
none
of
them
seemed
to
care
for
the
ministrations
of
the
priest
or
the
gaol
chaplain
to
them
it
seemed
cowardly
and
unreasonable
to
ask
god
for
mercy
simply
because
they
were
condemned
to
death
when
they
knew
very
well
that
they
would
have
been
living
in
defiance
of
god
and
man
if
they
had
remained
free
after
some
time
they
yielded
to
the
counsel
and
entreaties
of
their
spiritual
advisers
so
far
as
to
listen
to
all
they
had
to
say
baker
appeared
to
attend
carefully
to
the
chaplain
ministration
and
partook
of
holy
communion
an
hour
before
the
execution
baker
was
troubled
about
the
welfare
of
his
sweetheart
nellie
and
spent
part
of
the
night
before
his
execution
in
writing
a
long
letter
to
her
in
this
letter
he
assured
her
of
his
love
and
constancy
and
begged
her
to
keep
in
the
path
of
right
all
the
three
men
walked
firmly
to
the
scaffold
where
they
shook
hands
all
round
saying
old
pal
nothing
more
the
drop
was
already
chalked
with
their
names
martin
in
the
centre
with
rudge
on
the
right
and
baker
on
the
left
the
men
stepped
at
once
to
their
places
and
gave
all
the
assistance
they
could
in
the
final
pinioning
and
in
the
adjustment
of
the
nooses
just
before
the
drop
fell
baker
cried
keep
straight
nellie
and
then
the
three
men
died
together
without
a
word
of
fear
or
even
a
quiver
or
a
pallid
cheek
amongst
them
the
youth
and
manly
bearing
of
baker
and
the
strong
affection
of
which
he
was
capable
as
shown
by
the
way
in
which
his
nellie
was
always
uppermost
in
his
thoughts
affected
me
very
much
his
execution
was
one
of
the
saddest
of
my
many
experiences
illustration
mrs
britland
ann
i
have
said
that
the
people
who
are
most
cruel
and
callous
in
their
murderous
deeds
are
often
most
cowardly
after
conviction
the
class
of
cruel
and
callous
murderers
is
quite
distinct
from
that
of
the
violent
murderers
like
rudge
martin
and
baker
these
men
fighting
against
the
law
fight
fairly
according
to
their
lights
they
take
risks
and
meet
the
consequences
in
a
straightforward
manner
but
the
cruel
and
callous
class
show
a
cowardice
and
selfishness
of
which
rudge
martin
and
baker
were
incapable
an
instance
of
this
occurs
to
me
in
the
case
of
mary
ann
britland
whom
i
executed
at
strangeways
gaol
manchester
she
was
an
example
of
the
class
of
persons
to
whom
the
three
weeks
respite
before
death
is
the
greatest
possible
cruelty
she
was
condemned
for
the
murder
of
a
woman
who
had
befriended
her
and
in
whose
house
she
was
living
as
a
guest
at
the
time
of
the
murder
she
was
also
proved
to
have
murdered
her
own
husband
and
daughter
by
the
same
means
namely
poison
it
seems
hard
to
conceive
of
any
adequate
motive
for
such
a
series
of
crimes
extending
over
a
considerable
time
but
a
theory
was
advanced
and
supported
by
her
confession
to
the
effect
that
she
desired
to
marry
the
husband
of
her
latest
victim
to
accomplish
this
object
she
first
killed
her
daughter
for
what
exact
reason
is
not
clear
unless
she
feared
that
the
girl
had
some
suspicion
of
her
design
upon
the
others
then
her
husband
and
finally
her
friend
who
had
pitied
her
lonely
and
widowed
circumstances
and
given
her
food
and
shelter
the
husband
of
the
third
victim
was
tried
with
a
view
to
bringing
him
in
as
an
accomplice
but
the
investigation
showed
that
he
had
never
shown
any
friendliness
for
britland
and
that
it
was
clearly
impossible
that
he
could
have
had
any
connection
with
the
murders
at
her
trial
she
was
completely
unnerved
not
by
remorse
but
by
fear
when
the
verdict
was
announced
and
she
was
asked
if
she
had
anything
to
say
why
sentence
should
not
be
passed
she
burst
into
tears
during
the
passing
of
the
sentence
she
incessantly
interrupted
the
judge
with
cries
for
mercy
but
finding
such
appeals
of
no
avail
she
screamed
to
heaven
in
tones
of
the
greatest
agony
even
after
she
had
been
removed
to
the
cells
her
screams
could
be
heard
for
a
long
time
by
people
outside
during
the
time
that
elapsed
before
her
execution
she
was
partly
buoyed
up
by
the
hope
of
a
reprieve
and
protested
her
innocence
almost
to
the
very
last
in
spite
of
her
hope
she
could
not
shut
out
the
terrible
fear
that
the
reprieve
might
not
come
and
the
dread
of
death
was
so
heavy
upon
her
as
to
reduce
her
in
three
weeks
to
a
haggard
wreck
of
her
former
self
she
prayed
long
and
apparently
earnestly
for
god
help
but
did
not
acknowledge
her
guilt
until
almost
the
last
moment
when
she
saw
that
there
was
no
hope
of
reprieve
when
the
morning
of
the
execution
came
she
was
so
weakened
as
to
be
utterly
unable
to
support
herself
and
she
had
to
be
practically
carried
to
the
scaffold
by
two
female
warders
for
an
hour
before
the
time
of
the
execution
she
had
been
moaning
and
crying
most
dismally
and
when
i
entered
her
cell
she
commenced
to
shriek
and
call
aloud
all
the
way
to
the
scaffold
her
cries
were
though
her
voice
was
weak
through
suffering
and
as
the
white
cap
was
placed
over
her
head
she
uttered
cries
which
one
of
the
reporters
described
as
such
as
one
might
expect
at
the
actual
separation
of
body
and
spirit
through
mortal
terror
the
female
warders
held
her
on
the
drop
until
the
noose
was
fixed
then
their
places
were
taken
by
two
male
warders
who
stepped
quickly
back
at
a
signal
which
i
gave
them
and
before
she
had
time
to
sway
sideways
or
to
collapse
the
drop
fell
and
the
wretched
woman
was
dead

james

some
condemned
persons
are
unconsciously
humorous
whilst
others
that

have

an
unconcerned
and

humorous
disposition

is
surprising
when

considers
the
grave
nature
of
my
business
with
them
james
murphy
whom
i
executed
at
york
in
november
of
for
the
murder
of
austwick
of
barnsley
seemed
to
look
upon
his
sentence
and
death
rather
as
a
joke
than
otherwise
and
perhaps
partly
as
a
matter
of
pride
he
never
seemed
to
think
that
it
was
a
very
serious
matter
and
the
principal
reference
that
he
made
to
the
subject
was
a
frequent
assurance
to
his
attendants
that
he
would
die
firmly
and
show
no
fear
on
the
scaffold
i
was
introduced
to
him
by
the
governor
of
york
castle
the
day
before
the
execution
while
he
was
at
dinner
he
was
told
that
a
gentleman
from
bradford
had
come
to
see
him
but
he
feigned
not
to
understand
my
identity
and
muttered
bradford
bradford
i
have
no
friends
at
bradford
then
it
was
explained
that
the
gentleman
in
question
was
his
executioner
and
he
smilingly
replied
oh
of
course
but
continued
picking
the
mutton
bone
on
which
he
had
been
engaged
when
we
entered
in
the
last
letter
that
he
wrote
speaking
of
this
incident
he
said
i
am
in
good
spirits
the
governor
brought
your
letter
to
me
at
dinner
time
and
the
hangs
man
with
him
i
shaked
hands
with
the
hangs
man
and
he
ast
me
to
forgive
him
and
i
did
so
i
eat
my
dinner
none
the
worse
for
the
same
statement
might
also
apply
to
his
supper
and
his
breakfast
next
morning
for
during
the
whole
of
his
imprisonment
his
good
humour
and
resolution
never
deserted
him
for
a
moment
he
was
perfectly
contented
with
the
arrangements
made
for
him
by
the
prison
authorities
but
the
roman
catholic
priests
in
attendance
could
get
no
satisfaction
out
of
him
whatever
he
parted
from
his
brother
wife
and
daughter
without
any
sign
of
emotion
in
the
manner
of
a
working
man
who
was
starting
for
his
labour
he
did
justice
to
his
last
meal
and
when
it
was
finished
asked
for
a
pipe
of
bacca
the
only
request
that
he
made
with
which
the
governor
was
unable
to
comply
he
seemed
to
take
a
great
interest
in
the
pinioning
process
and
helped
me
as
well
as
he
could
his
request
was
that
i
would
execute
him
quickly
and
painlessly
and
this
favour
i
was
able
to
grant
was
hanged
in
gloucester
prison
on
february
for
the
murder
of
a
boy
at
stroud
the
object
was
robbery
for
the
boy
was
carrying
money
to
pay
wages
from
the
bank
pritchard
practically
pleaded
guilty
and
appeared
to
be
sincerely
sorry
for
his
deed
he
was
not
anxious
to
escape
death
but
took
great
pains
to
secure
the
forgiveness
of
the
firm
whose
money
he
had
taken
and
of
the
parents
of
the
boy
whom
he
had
murdered
in
order
to
get
it
to
the
father
of
the
lad
he
wrote
a
letter
earnestly
begging
for
his
forgiveness
and
allen
who
was
a
good
man
journeyed
to
gloucester
to
convey
an
assurance
of
that
forgiveness
in
person
and
to
pray
with
the
murderer
owing
to
a
prison
regulation
pritchard
was
unable
to
receive
allen
visit
but
the
fact
that
the
visit
was
made
seemed
a
great
consolation
to
the
prisoner
while
waiting
for
execution
pritchard
frequently
showed
much
emotion
and
it
was
feared
that
there
might
be
a
scene
at
the
last
moment
but
when
the
time
came
he
was
composed
there
was
no
reckless
bravado
but
a
quiet
submission
he
walked
uprightly
to
the
scaffold
and
stood
motionless
upon
the
drop
for
a
second
his
glance
wandered
round
the
and
in
that
second
he
seemed
to
comprehend
everything
he
saw
his
grave
ready
dug
in
a
corner
and
heaved
a
sob
but
this
was
his
only
demonstration
of
feeling

of
showing
his
contrition
and
making
his
peace
with
god
and
on
the
day
before
his
execution
he
attended
the
prison
chapel
occupying
a
screened
pew
where
he
paid
careful
attention
to
the
service
and
appeared
much
solaced
by
a
portion
of
the
sermon
which
was
introduced
for
his
special
benefit
on
the
morning
of
his
last
day
he
was
awake
early
and
spent
the
time
with
the
good
chaplain
of
the
gaol
as
i
entered
the
cell
the
poor
fellow
was
slowly
repeating
the
responses
to
the
prayers
read
by
the
chaplain
and
he
continued
to
do
so
during
the
pinioning
the
chaplain
was
assiduous
in
his
attentions
and
did
not
weary
of
his
good
work
even
when
on
the
scaffold
but
continued
to
comfort
and
solace
the
doomed
man
with
an
earnestness
that
indicated
the
depth
of
his
sympathy
at
the
last
moment
the
calm
but
wretched
culprit
raised
his
head
drew
a
deep
breath
and
said
in
a
deep
solemn
unshaken
tone
lord
have
mercy
upon
me
lord
receive
me
and
so
he
died
this
execution
affected
me
deeply
the
man
was
fully
conscious
of
the
hideousness
of
his
crime
and
sincerely
repented
he
assured
the
chaplain
that
he
beheld
the
world
and
all
things
in
a
totally
new
light
and
that
the
consciousness
of
his
crime
had
changed
his
whole
character

would
have
been
the
fate
of
such
a
man

alfred

one
of
the
worst
cases
i
ever
had
to
deal
with
was
that
of
alfred
sowrey
hanged
at
lancaster
castle
on
august
for
shooting
the
girl
to
whom
he
was
engaged
to
be
married
at
preston
he
was
impenitent
violent
and
with
fear
by
the
day
of
execution
at
the
time
of
his
trial
he
glared
about
in
such
a
mad
way
that
those
who
stood
near
the
dock
feared
for
their
personal
safety
during
the
time
between
sentence
and
execution
he
became
seriously
ill
through
sheer
terror
and
it
was
thought
that
he
could
not
possibly
live
to
the
day
appointed
for
his
execution
the
efforts
of
the
gaol
chaplain
to
bring
sowrey
to
a
calmer
and
more
reasonable
state
of
mind
seemed
utterly
unavailing
the
prisoner
was
too
terrified
to
take
much
notice
of
anything
that
was
said
to
him
on
the
morning
of
the
execution
he
took
his
breakfast
as
usual
but
rejected
the
chaplain
ministrations
from
the
cell
to
the
scaffold
he
had
to
be
partly
pushed
and
partly
carried
by
two
warders
in
whose
strong
arms
he
struggled
violently
his
groans
and
cries
could
be
heard
all
over
the
prison
his
teeth
chattered
and
his
face
was
alternately
livid
and
deathly
white
every
inch
of
ground
over
which
the
procession
passed
was
violently
contested
by
the
criminal
who
had
to
be
bodily
carried
up
the
steps
and
placed
on
the
drop
as
he
saw
the
beam
above
him
a
wilder
paroxysm
of
fear
seemed
to
seize
the
miserable
youth
and
four
warders
were
required
to
hold
him
in
position
even
with
this
assistance
i
had
the
greatest
possible
difficulty
in
pinioning
his
legs
and
while
doing
so
i
received
a
nasty
kick
which
took
a
piece
of
bone
out
of
my
shin
and
has
left
a
mark
visible
even
after
the
completion
of
the
pinioning
process
he
still
resisted
the
placing
of
the
noose
throwing
his
head
violently
from
side
to
side
and
he
continued
his
struggles
until
the
drop
fell
during
the
whole
of
this
terrible
scene
the
chaplain
who
had
taken
much
interest
in
his
ungrateful
charge
and
who
had
done
everything
he
could
for
sowrey
continued
reading
the
beautiful
prayers
for
the
dying
but

paid
no
heed

was
a
retired
army
surgeon
of
good
family
his
medical
experience
gave
him
a
great
advantage
in
the
commission
of
his
crime
and
he
was
evidently
convinced
that
there
was
not
the
slightest
fear
of
discovery
after
conviction
he
protested
his
innocence
until
he
received
the
message
to
the
effect
that
there
would
be
no
reprieve
but
that
the
law
must
take
its
course
he
then
relapsed
into
a
mournful
condition
and
turned
his
attention
entirely
to
the
bible
the
last
few
days
before
his
execution
he
was
greatly
prostrated
and
on
his
last
night
of
life
he
did
not
retire
to
bed
until
twelve
his
sleep
was
restless
and
fitful
in
the
morning
however
he
was
resolute
he
told
his
attendants
that
he
did
not
fear
death
for
he
had
met
it

that
of
joseph
walker
executed
at
oxford
in
november
he
had
murdered
his
second
wife
after
great
provocation
her
reckless
drinking
habits
and
jealous
disposition
developed
soon
after
the
marriage
had
made
the
home
absolutely
miserable
on
several
occasions
she
threatened
her
husband
with
a
knife
and
the
only
way
in
which
he
could
defend
himself
without
injuring
her
was
by
seizing
her
wrists
and
holding
her
down
on
the
floor
until
her
fury
abated
the
climax
was
reached
when
one
of
walker
sons
by
his
first
wife
who
had
been
driven
from
home
by
his
committed
suicide
the
father
attributed
this
to
the
cruelty
she
went
to
croydon
where
the
suicide
was
committed
to
attend
the
inquest
and
instead
of
returning
home
remained
in
london
until
her
husband
went
to
fetch
her
up
to
this
time
he
had
been
steady
but
after
the
return
from
london
he
gave
way
to
excessive
drinking
and
neglected
his
work
on
the
day
of
the
murder
there
was
a
violent
quarrel
between
the
man
and
his
wife
and
when
he
fell
into
a
drunken
sleep
she
rifled
his
pockets
of
a
considerable
sum
of
money
at
night
walker
cut
his
wife
throat
killing
her
with
one
terrible
blow
and
then
sobered
by
his
act
called
a
neighbour
to
witness
what
he
had
done
and
surrendered
to
the
police
who
had
been
fetched
to
the
house
the
verdict
of
guilty
was
brought
in
by
the
jury
but
a
strong
recommendation
to
mercy
was
at
the
same
time
handed
to
the
judge
in
consequence
of
the
great
provocation
which
had
been
received
by
walker
strenuous
efforts
were
made
to
induce
the
home
secretary
to
commute
the
death
sentence
to
one
of
penal
servitude
but
without
avail
the
condemned
man
was
perfectly
willing
to
die
and
his
earnest
repentance
greatly
touched
the
chaplain
who
laboured
early
and
late
to
comfort
him
walker
spent
much
of
his
time
in
fervent
prayer
not
for
himself
but
for
his
children
he
prayed
continuously
that
his
sin
might
not
be
visited
on
them
for
he
knew
how
our
christian
country
usually
treats
those
who
have
the
burden
of
a
dishonoured
name
to
bear
he
besought
both
god
and
man
to
treat
his
children
kindly
and
to
lead
them
in
the
way
of
sobriety
and
honesty
for
himself
while
confessing
the
murder
he
denied
any
premeditation
of
the
matter
at
the
time
of
execution
he
was
perfectly
composed
and
walked
calmly
to
the
scaffold
but
he
seemed
to
see
nothing
his
thoughts
were
far
away
and
even
after
death
his
face
wore
the
same
expression
of
sad
composure

his
success
in
hiding
from

taken
in
his
case
was
executed
by
me
in
the
same
gaol
in
which
his
crime
occurred
although
he
was
commonly
supposed
to
be
incapable
of
feeling
his
emotion
at
the
prospect
of
his
own
fate
was
so
touching
that
the
official
who
had
to
tell
him
that
reprieve
was
refused
was
very
loth
to
break
the
news
on
hearing
it
he
bowed
his
head
and
burst
into
tears
for
strange
as
it
may
seem
he
had
hoped
that
the
death
sentence
would
not
be
carried
out
his
grief
continued
to
the
last
and
to
the
last
he
maintained
that
he
had
only
intended
to
stun
and
not
to
kill
the
warder
on
the
night
before
his
death
he
did
not
sleep
two
hours
and
when
i
entered
his
cell
in
the
morning
he
was
engaged
in
fervent
prayer
he
shook
hands
with
me
in
a
manner
that
was
most
affecting
and
submitted
quietly
to
the
pinioning
he
walked
resignedly
to
the
scaffold
and
died
without
uttering

sound

one
naturally
expects
a
hard
indifference
from
an
old
criminal
but
it
saddens
me
to
see
it
in
the
young
and
yet
two
of
the
youngest
men
or
rather
boys
that
i
have
executed
were
callous
to
the
last
degree
they
were

in

for
the
murder
of
a
at

in

some
six
months
before
so
carefully
was
the
crime
committed
that
the
police
could
obtain
no
clue
and
it
was
only
found
out
by
the
confession
of
the
lads
to
a
salvation
army
officer
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
the
lads
natural
taste
for
adventure
had
been
morbidly
stimulated
by
the
reading
of
highly
sensational
literature
penny
dreadfuls
and
the
like
they
seem
to
have
conducted
themselves
with
a
sort
of
bravado
or
courage
which
if
genuine
would
have
done
credit
to
a
patriot
or
martyr
sacrificing
himself
for
country
or
for
faith
or
to
one
of
their
backwoods
heroes
fighting
against
a
horde
of
painted
savages
but
which
was
distressing
in
two
lads
almost
children
sentenced
to
death
for
their
crime
after
they
were
sentenced
they
paid
careful
attention
to
the
chaplain
words
but
they
showed
no
sign
of
emotion
and
it
was
said
that
it
is
doubtful
whether
at
any
time
they
fully
realised
the
serious
nature
of
their
position
they
walked
to
the
scaffold
in
defiant
manner
more
upright
than
was
their
wont
and
neither
of
them
looked
at
or
spoke
to
the
other
there
was
no
farewell
no
word
of
repentance
or
regret
merely
a
brief
supplication
to
god
to
receive
them
and
joseph
it
is
a
terrible
trial
to
have
to
execute
men
who
firmly
believe
and
apparently
on
reasonable
even
if
not
correct
grounds
that
they
are
suffering
an
injustice
the
worst
instance
that
i
remember
of
this
kind
was
in
the
case
of
samuel
and
joseph
boswell
executed
in
worcester
gaol
for
the
murder
of
a
on
the
estate
of
the
duc
at
evesham
three
men
the
boswells
and
alfred
hill
were
found
guilty
of
the
murder
and
the
only
difference
which
the
jury
could
find
in
their
guilt
was
that
hill
was
if
anything
the
worst
of
the
three
an
application
for
a
reprieve
was
made
apparently
on
the
ground
that
though
the
men
were
guilty
of
poaching
they
had
not
intended
to
commit
murder
the
home
secretary
responded
to
this
application
by
reducing
the
penalty
in
hill
case
to
penal
servitude
for
life
this
action
fairly
astounded
the
people
of
evesham
who
thought
that
there
was
no
possible
reason
for
making
any
difference
in
the
fate
of
the
three
culprits
the
vicar
telegraphed
to
the
home
secretary
that
his
decision
was
absolutely
incomprehensible
the
mayor
on
behalf
of
the
borough
telegraphed
to
the
effect
that
universal
indignation
was
expressed
by
the
whole
community
in
evesham
and
by
county
gentlemen
several
other
similar
messages
were
sent
from
other
bodies
and
the
vicar
of
evesham
was
dispatched
to
london
to
interview
the
home
secretary
the
news
was
communicated
to
hill
but
not
to
the
boswells
and
as
the
feeling
amongst
outsiders
was
so
strong
it
can
be
imagined
that
the
two
men
who
had
to
suffer
the
punishment
were
shocked
with
a
sense
of
injustice
when
they
met
on
the
morning
of
the
execution
and
found
that
hill
had
been
reprieved
when
they
met
on
that
fatal
morning
the
brothers
kissed
each
other
and
looking
round
they
enquired
simultaneously
where
hill
on
being
answered
they
seemed
utterly
broken
down
with
the
feeling
of
the
injustice
of
the
arrangement
they
asserted
that
hill
was
the
real
murderer
whilst
they
were
only
accomplices
the
men
had
been
much
troubled
during
their
imprisonment
by
the
thought
of
what
would
happen
to
their
wives
and
children
and
were
in
a
terribly
harassed
and
nervous
condition
i
put
the
white
caps
on
their
heads
before
leaving
the
cells
and
a
few
steps
from
the
door
of
the
house
in
which
the
scaffold
stood
i
pulled
the
caps
over
their
eyes
this
i
always
do
when
men
are
not
quite
firm
and
determined
before
they
see
the
scaffold
in
the
case
of
samuel
boswell
this
simple
act
caused
him
to
fall
back
into
the
arms
of
one
of
the
warders
in
a
state
of
collapse
and
he
had
to
be
almost
carried
on
to
the
scaffold
he
moaned
several
times
until
he
heard
his
brother
voice
give
the
response
lord
have
mercy
upon
us
when
he
again
drew
himself
together
and
answered
christ
have
mercy
upon
us
then
joseph
piteously
cried
oh
my
poor
dear
wife
yes
answered
samuel
and
my
dear
wife
and
my
poor
children
joseph
turned
his
head
a
little
and
said
sam
to
which
his
brother
answered
god
bless
you
joe
boy
oh
dear
dear
joseph
continued
i
hope
everybody
will
do
well
and
as
he
finished
speaking
the
drop
fell
and
together
the
brothers
expiated
their
crime
another
case
in
which
the
one
was
taken
and
the
other
left
was
the
crewe
murder
case
in
which
richard
and
george
davies
were
found
guilty
of
the
murder
of
their
father
with
a
strong
recommendation
to
mercy
on
account
of
their
youth
so
far
as
could
be
made
out
there
was
absolutely
no
difference
in
the
degrees
of
their
guilt
but
the
sentence
of
george
was
commuted
to
penal
servitude
simply
because
he
was
the
younger
at
this
there
was
great
excitement
throughout
the
country
and
thousands
of
telegrams
and
petitions
were
poured
into
the
home
office
begging
that
the
leniency
might
be
equally
extended
to
both
since
the
guilt
of
both
was
equal
but
all
to
no
purpose
the
condemned
lad
protested
to
his
last
moments
that
although
he
took
part
in
the
murder
he
never
struck
his
father
nor
handled
the
hatchet
with
which
the
deed
was
done
he
wrote
most
affectionate
letters
to
his
mother
brothers
and
sisters
who
seemed
to
fully
believe
the
truth
of
his
statements
with
regard
to
his
share
in
the
crime
ten
minutes
before
his
death
he
wrote
out
the
same
declaration
and
handed
it
to
the
chaplain
he
stated
that
he
had
no
wish
to
live
but
that
he
hoped
and
expected
to
meet
his
relations
in
heaven
when
i
entered
his
cell
he
was
pale
but
calm
after
pinioning
him
his
face
seemed
still
paler
and
his
mouth
worked
convulsively
as
he
strove
to
keep
back
his
emotion
along
the
corridor
he
walked
firmly
with
bent
head
but
when
we
reached
the
yard
where
a
fresh
breeze
was
blowing
and
the
blue
sky
was
visible
he
raised
his
head
and
eyes
for
a
last
look
at
the
world
and
the
sky
he
died
firmly
with
a
brief
prayer
on
his
lips
in
both
the
cases
last
described
the
action
of
the
home
secretary
was
very
severely
commented
upon
by
press
and
public
and
it
seems
to
me
that
such
occurrences
are
the
strongest
possible
arguments
in
favour
of
the
of
the
law
which
i
suggest
in
the
chapter
on
capital
punishment
it
is
decidedly
injurious
for
the
public
to
have
the
idea
that
the
life
or
death
of
a
man
depends
upon
the
urgency
of
the
petitions
in
his
favour
and
the
amount
of
sympathy
expressed
for
him
rather
than
upon
the
justice
of
the
case
moreover
it
seems
to
me
that
by
singling
out
special
cases
and
attacking
the
decision
of
the
home
office
the
press
and
the
public
place
themselves
in
a
thoroughly
illogical
position
if
they
object
to
the
system
of
leaving
the
matter
in
the
hands
of
the
home
secretary
surely
it
is
the
system
and
not
the
man
that
should
be
attacked
on
the
other
hand
if
they
are
satisfied
that
the
home
secretary
is
the
proper
tribunal
they
ought
surely
to
rest
content
with
his
ruling
remembering
that
he
has
far
better
opportunities
of
judging
the
merits
of
the
case
and
the
whole
of
the
evidence
than
any
outsider
can
possibly
have
and
that
his
responsibility
in
the
matter
makes
him
more
careful
in
his
enquiry
than
any
outsider
possibly
can
be
the
melancholy
interest
of
the
subject
allures
me
to
continue
yet
the
details
of
murderers
deaths
at
the
best
are
ghastly
and
grim
and
i
fear
that
my
readers
will
shudderingly
wish
me
to
stop
two
more
experiences
and
i
will
close
the
sad
record
eleanor
better
known
as
pearcey
was
a
woman
of
decidedly
strong
character
her
crime
is
so
recent
and
aroused
so
much
interest
that
i
need
not
go
over
the
circumstances
the
night
before
her
execution
was
spent
in
the
condemned
cell
watched
by
three
female
warders
who
stated
that
her
fortitude
was
remarkable
when
introduced
to
her
i
said
good
morning
madam
and
she
shook
my
proffered
hand
without
any
trace
of
emotion
she
was
certainly
the
most
composed
person
in
the
whole
party
sir
james
whitehead
the
sheriff
of
the
county
of
london
asked
her
if
she
wished
to
make
any
statement
as
her
last
opportunity
for
doing
so
was
fast
approaching
and
after
a
pause
she
said
my
sentence
is
a
just
one
but
a
good
deal
of
the
evidence
against
me
was
false
as
the
procession
was
formed
and
one
of
the
female
warders
stepped
to
each
side
of
the
prisoner
she
turned
to
them
with
a
considerate
desire
to
save
them
the
pain
of
the
death
scene
and
said
you
have
no
need
to
assist
me
i
can
walk
by
myself
one
of
the
women
said
that
she
did
not
mind
but
was
ready
and
willing
to
accompany
pearcey
who
answered
oh
well
if
you
do
mind
going
with
me
i
am
pleased
she
then
kissed
them
all
and
quietly
proceeded
to
her
painless
death
illustration
mrs
pearcey
who
murdered
a
boy
of
ten
years
old
at
liverpool
was
a
case
that
was
most
difficult
to
understand
his
previous
record
did
not
indicate
any
quarrelsome
or
murderous
tendency
though
he
was
known
to
get
drunk
occasionally
and
there
seemed
to
be
absolutely
no
motive
that
could
be
assigned
for
the
crime
his
confession
was
made
privately
to
the
priest
the
day
before
his
execution
with
instructions
that
it
should
be
read
as
soon
as
he
was
dead
but
it
left
the
matter
of
motive
as
mysterious
as
ever
it
was
as
follows
in
confessing
my
guilt
i
protest
that
my
motive
was
not
outrage
such
a
thought
i
never
in
all
my
life
entertained
drink
has
been
my
ruin
not
lust
i
was
impelled
to
the
crime
while
under
the
influence
of
drink
by
a
fit
of
murderous
mania
and
a
morbid
curiosity
to
observe
the
process
of
dying
a
moment
after
the
commission
of
the
crime
i
experienced
the
deepest
sorrow
of
it
and
would
have
done
anything
in
the
world
to
undo
it
conway
was
a
very
superstitious
man
a
believer
in
omens
witchcraft
and
all
sorts
of
supernatural
powers
and
he
had
a
firm
idea
that
if
one
good
man
could
be
induced
to
pray
for
him
he
would
be
saved
from
execution
he
was
sure
that
his
own
prayers
would
avail
nothing
and
he
thought
that
he
was
not
fit
to
receive
the
sacrament
of
his
church
but
he
attended
the
service
at
which
the
sacrament
was
administered
and
begged
that
one
of
his
who
partook
of
the
rite
should
pray
for
him
as
he
reached
the
scaffold
conway
stared
wildly
around
and
cried
out
that
he
wanted
to
say
something
the
priest
interfered
to
induce
me
to
stop
the
execution
for
a
few
seconds
and
i
did
so
but
the
convict
merely
thanked
the
gaol
officials
and
his
father
confessor
for
their
kindness
and
so
he
died
illustration
john
conway
does
the
reader
think
that
i
have
spun
out
this
chapter
too
much
does
he
think
that
i
have
unnecessarily
harrowed
his
feelings
if
so
let
me
assure
him
that
i
would
not
have
given
this
chapter
i
would
not
have
written
this
book
if
i
had
not
had
what
i
believe
to
be
good
purposes
in
view
i
have
tried
to
avoid
sensationalism
but
i
want
to
make
every
reader
i
want
to
make
him
think
that
murderers
are
after
all
men
and
women
with
human
sympathies
and
passions
i
want
to
make
him
think
that
there
are
degrees
of
murder
that
justice
and
not
spasmodic
leniency
should
be
the
aim
of
our
laws
and
a
few
other
thoughts
that
will
occur
to
the

any
suggestion

chapter
ix
from
the
murderer
point
of

burns
sang
and
we
are
fond
of
repeating
his
singing
oh
wad
some
power
the
giftie
gie
us
to
see
oursels
as
ithers
see
us
but
i
never
heard
anybody
utter
the
opposite
aspiration
for
the
gift
to
see
others
as
they
see
themselves
and
yet
i
am
not
quite
sure
that
this
gift
is
not
as
desirable
as
the
other
at
any
rate
if
we
are
to
legislate
wisely
and
well
for
any
class
of
people
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
we
should
be
able
to
see
things
from
their
own
point
of
view
it
is
with
much
hesitation
that
i
start
this
chapter
for
i
know
that
my
power
to
analyze
thought
and
character
is
not
great
enough
to
enable
me
to
deal
with
the
subject
on
broad
lines
but
if
i
can
induce
a
few
people
to
consider
the
question
of
murder
and
its
punishment
from
the
murderer
point
of
view
the
chapter
will
do
good
on
the
whole
i
think
that
our
attitude
towards
murderers
is
based
too
much
on
sentiment
and
too
little
on
reason
many
people
pity
all
murderers
whether
they
deserve
it
or
not
many
others
condemn
them
body
soul
and
spirit
without
considering
to
what
extent
they
are
the
result
of
circumstances
if
i
can
induce
my
readers
to
consider
that
a
murderer
has
as
much
right
to
judge
the
state
as
the
state
has
to
judge
him
i
think
this
book
will
have
achieved
one
good
purpose
i
do
not
wish
to
work
out
an
argument
but
will
just
give
a
few
of
the
expressed
ideas
of
the
murderers
in
the
hope
that
they
may
give
rise
to
fruitful
trains
of
thought
i
would
point
out
however
that
many
of
the
people
who
have
died
on
the
scaffold
have
lived
in
such
deplorable
circumstances
assailed
by
every
sort
of
temptation
surrounded
by
an
atmosphere
of
gay
and
hollow
vice
cradled
in
misery
and
educated
in
wretchedness
and
sin
with
little
of
the
good
and
the
beautiful
entering
into
their
lives
to
raise
them
but
with
the
accursed
facility
for
obtaining
drink
to
lure
them
down
in
such
deplorable
circumstances
i
say
that
even
an
angel
could
hardly
keep
himself
unspotted
from
such
a
world
when
men
commit
a
horrible
crime
it
is
our
duty
to
exact
the
penalty
but
it
will
do
us
no
harm
to
consider
whether
we
are
in
any
way
responsible
for
the
conditions
which
may
have
driven
them
to
crime
and
whether
we
can
not
do
even
more
than
we
are
doing
for
the
prevention
of
crime
by
the
improvement
of
the
conditions
besides
the
conditions
of
life
the
mental
status
of
the
wretched
culprits
should
be
worthy
of
attention
and
i
think
we
might
ask
ourselves
whether
it
would
not
have
been
better
for
some
of
the
murderers
as
well
as
for
society
if
they
had
been
placed
under
restraint
years
before
their
careers
reached
the
murder
stage
there
are
many
other
questions
which
will
naturally
occur
to
the
thoughtful
reader
and
which
i
need
not
indicate
amongst
my
earlier
executions
was
that
of
arthur
shaw
at
liverpool
shaw
was
a
tailor
years
of
age
who
lived
in
manchester
he
was
married
but
his
married
life
was
not
happy
for
his
wife
seems
to
have
drunk
heavily
and
he
himself
was
not
steady
on
november
they
quarrelled
and
fought
for
some
time
and
shortly
afterwards
the
woman
was
found
dead
killed
according
to
the
doctors
by
strangulation
shaw
did
not
deny
the
murder
but
pleaded
that
it
was
unintentional
and
that
he
had
been
greatly
provoked
by
his
dissipation
the
jury
strongly
recommended
him
to
mercy
immediately
before
meeting
his
fate
in
a
last
conversation
with
the
chaplain
the
man
admitted
his
guilt
but
earnestly
insisted
that
he
had
never
intended
to
cause
his
wife
death
he
stated
that
he
was
not
drunk
at
the
time
of
the
murder
but
that
he
had
been
driven
to
drink
by
his
wife
drunkenness
and
neglect
of
the
home
which
was
always
miserable
and
that
her
drunkenness
and
neglect
exasperated
him
until
he
was
perfectly
wild
he
concluded
by
saying
when
we
were
having
the
scuffle
i
had
no
idea
i
was
killing
the
poor
woman
hanged
in
galway
on
january
for
the
murder
of
miss
burns
wrote
a
long
statement
which
he
handed
to
the
governor
to
be
read
after
his
death
the
gist
of
it
was
given
in
the
following
paragraph
i
wish
to
assure
the
public
and
my
family
and
friends
that
i
was
of
unsound
mind
for
a
week
previous
to
the
murder
and
for
some
time
afterwards
i
am
happy
to
suffer
for
the
crime
which
i
committed
and
confident
that
i
shall
enter
upon
an
eternity
of
bliss
i
die
at
peace
with
all
men
and
hope
that
anyone
that
i
have
ever
injured
will
forgive
me
of
swanwick
poisoned
his
little
daughter
for
the
purpose
it
is
supposed
of
obtaining
the
sum
of
for
which
her
life
was
insured
and
was
executed
at
derby
on
february
it
is
difficult
or
impossible
for
an
ordinary
person
to
understand
such
a
man
frame
of
mind
one
would
think
him
absolutely
callous
yet
he
wept
over
the
body
of
his
child
when
he
found
that
she
was
dead
and
wrote
most
affectionate
letters
to
his
other
children
when
he
was
in
prison
a
portion
of
his
last
letter
to
his
eldest
daughter
was
as
follows
you
must
be
sure
to
pray
to
god
to
gide
you
all
you
life
through
and
you
must
pray
for
your
brothers
and
sisters
i
do
pray
to
god
to
gard
you
all
you
life
through
so
my
dear

you
must
think
of
what
i
have
told
you
you
must
always
tell
the
truth
when
you
are
tempted
to
do
wrong
you
must
pray
to
god
for
his
help
and
he
will
hear
you
always
remember
that
my
dear
children
and
you
must
tell
the
others

edward
pritchard
was
an
instance
of
how
evil
communications
corrupt
good
manners
and
a
striking
example
of
the
unfortunate
uselessness
of
our
reformatory
system
at
twelve
years
of
age
he
was
convicted
for
being
an
associate
of
thieves
and
sentenced
to
two
years
in
a
reformatory
for
three
years
after
leaving
the
reformatory
he
managed
to
keep
out
of
prison
but
when
seventeen
he
was
sentenced
to
four
months
imprisonment
for
and
after
this
he
was
frequently
in
gaol
about
a
year
before
the
murder
he
appeared
to
have
reformed
attended
and
chapel
and
took
an
active
part
in
religious
work
right
up
to
the
time
of
committing
the
murder
he
murdered
a
small
boy
of
fourteen
who
was
in
the
habit
of
regularly
fetching
money
from
the
bank
to
pay
the
wages
at
a
large
factory
and
stole
from
him
the
wages
money
amounting
to
over
the
evidence
of
the
deed
was
absolutely
conclusive
and
overwhelming
and
pritchard
had
no
hope
of
reprieve
a
day
or
two
after
his
conviction
he
wrote
a
letter
to
one
of
his
teachers
in
which
he
professed
to
have
seen
the
error
of
his
ways
urged
all
his
companions
to
shun
bad
company
drinking
and
smoking
spoke
of
the
delight
with
which
he
remembered
some
of
the
hymns
and
anticipated
the
pleasure
of
soon
singing
them
up
there
all
through
his
life
there
seems
to
have
been
a
struggle
between
good
and
evil
with
an
unfortunate
balance
of
power
on
the
side
of
evil
it
is
difficult
to
believe
that
he
would
have
devoted
his
spare
time
for
a
year
to
religious
work
if
he
had
not
felt
strong
aspirations
for
the
higher
life
after
conviction
he
said
but
little
about
himself
and
made
no
formal
statement
or
confession
but
a
letter
which
he
wrote
to
the
father
of
the
murdered
boy
will
throw
some
light
upon
his
mental
state
in
this
letter
pritchard
distinctly
affirms
that
he
was
led
to
commit
the
crime
by
the
instigation
of
a
companion
and
though
the
statements
of
a
convicted
murderer
must
always
be
received
with
caution
it
is
possible
that
there
was
some
ground
for
this
assertion
if
the
crime
was
really
suggested
and
the
criminal
encouraged
by
the
influence
of
another
and
probably
a
stronger
mind
we
may
well
ask
ourselves
how
much
of
the
moral
blame
attaches
to
the
instigator
and
how
much
to
the
weak
tool
the
letter
was
as
follows
her
majesty
prison
sir
i
write
these
lines
to
you
to
express
my
deep
sorrow
for
the
dreadful
crime
i
have
done
to
you
and
to
your
master
i
write
to
ask
you
if
you
and
your

will
forgive
me
for
killing
your
boy
and
please
ask
the
master
if
he
will
forgive
me
for
taking
his
money
from
him
it
would
not
have
happened
if
i
had
not
been
incited
to
do
it
and
it
was
by
no
other
person
than
who
was
a
witness
against
me
he
persuaded
me
to
do
it
and
said
he
might
do
it
himself
if
i
did
not
so
i
done
the
unhappy
affair
i
am
very
sorry
i
ever
met
with
at
all
but
it
can
not
be
called
back
now
i
have
cried
to
god
for
mercy
i
must
still
cry
and
i
hope
i
shall
gain
a
better
home
i
have
asked
him
to
forgive
me
and
blot
out
all
my
sins
and
wash
me
in
my
saviour
precious
blood
and
i
think
and
feel
he
will
do
it

going
to
receive
the
holy

on

and
i
should
like
to
hear
from
you
by

before
i
go
to
be
partaker
of
that
holy
feast
if
you
will
forgive
me
i
shall
be
more
at
peace
i
am
very
very
sorry
indeed
for
what
i
have
done
there
is
nothing
that
can
save
me
from
my
doom
which
will
be
on

but
i
can
ask

to
have

on
my
poor

alfred
scandrett
another
young
man
only
just
years
old
was
another
example
of
the
result
of
bad
influences
his
father
deserted
the
home
when
alfred
was
about
ten
years
old
his
mother
was
a
woman
who
contrived
to
support
her
family
by
mangling
and
by
selling
papers
in
the
streets
in
which
latter
work
she
was
assisted
by
alfred
and
several
other
children
the
lad
was
fond
of
hanging
round
street
corners
and
and
his
mother
found
it
impossible
to
keep
him
at
home
like
the
other
children
he
continually
made
resolutions
but
again
and
again
he
was
led
away
by
his
companions
and
at
twelve
years
of
age
he
was
convicted
for
stealing
cigars
from
a
shop
but
discharged
with
a
caution
a
month
later
he
was
charged
with
another
offence
and
sentenced
to
days
other
imprisonments
followed
then
five
years
in
a
reformatory
but
punishment
was
no
cure
his
love
for
his
mother
was
his
one
redeeming
feature
and
if
she
had
not
been
forced
by
grinding
poverty
to
work
almost
day
and
night
at
her
mangling
and
she
might
have
succeeded
in
saving
him
from
himself
he
tried
to
break
away
from
his
evil
associations
and
at
one
time
begged
his
mother
to
find
money
to
take
him
to
canada
but
she
was
utterly
unable
to
scrape
together
enough
to
pay
the
passage
a
youth
called
jones
who
was
hanged
with
scandrett
was
his
companion
in
his
final
crime
a
burglary
ending
in
murder
although
attached
to
his
mother
who
said
he
had
always
been
a
good
lad
to
her
scandrett
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
living
at
home
when
he
was
engaged
in
crime
so
that
almost
the
whole
of
the
last
eight
years
of
his
life
was
spent
when
out
of
gaol
in
common
after
his
conviction
for
murder
and
sentence
to
death
his
great
anxiety
was
for
his
mother
and
well
might
he
be
anxious
for
the
poor
woman
suffered
sadly
for
his
sin
as
soon
as
it
was
known
that
she
was
the
mother
of
a
murderer
her
customers
to
their
eternal
disgrace
be
it
said
withdrew
their
patronage
to
such
an
extent
that
her
mangling
earnings
dropped
from
or
to
a
week
and
her
newspaper
trade
fell
away
to
nothing
she
was
even
hunted
and
insulted
in
the
streets
when
she
went
to
her
accustomed
corner
to
sell
the
papers
to
get
from
her
home
in
birmingham
to
hereford
gaol
for
a
last
interview
with
her
son
she
was
obliged
to
pawn
her
dress
and
even
that
only
raised
enough
money
to
pay
the
fare
one
way
so
that
she
had
to
trust
to
chance
for
the
means
of
getting
back
again
some
of
the
prison
officials
more
humane
than
her
friends
at
home
subscribed
enough
money
to
pay
the
return
fare
the
last
meeting
was
a
very
affecting
one
scandrett
comforted
his
mother
by
assuring
her
that
they
would
meet
in
heaven
and
said
pray
daily
and
hourly

as
i
have
done
and
then
we
shall
meet

the
number
of
men
who
are
driven
to
crime
through
drink
is
something
terrible
and
i
should
think
that
no
temperance
worker
could
read
the
real
histories
of
the
murderers
who
have
come
under
my
hands
without
redoubling
his
efforts
to
save
men
from
the
curse
of
drink
a
case
in
point
was
arthur
delaney
executed
at
chesterfield
on
august
it
may
be
said
that
he
was
naturally
a
bad
violent
man
but
surely
he
would
never
have
become
a
murderer
if
he
had
not
consistently
made
himself
worse
and
worse
by
hard
drinking
his
victim
was
his
wife
to
whom
he
had
been
married
four
years
and
who
was
spoken
of
as
a
respectable
woman
not
very
long
after
the
marriage
in
a
drunken
fit
he
violently
assaulted
her
for
which
action
the
magistrates
imposed
a
fine
and
granted
a
separation
order
his
wife
however
forgave
him
and
in
spite
of
his
bad
behaviour
continued
to
live
with
him
a
few
days
before
the
murder
he
was
unusually
violent
and
treated
his
wife
so
brutally
that
she
was
obliged
to
again
appeal
to
the
magistrates
who
again
imposed
a
fine
this
raised
anger
to
such
an
extent
that
the
next
time
he
got
drunk
he
battered
his
wife
so
violently
that
she
had
to
be
removed
to
the
hospital
where
she
died
like
many
other
culprits
delaney
saw
the
cause
of
the
mischief
when
it
was
done
and
a
letter
written
after
his
sentence
has
a
ring
of
simple
earnestness
about
it
that
makes
it
worth
preserving
it
was
written
to
some
good
templars
who
had
tried

reform

arthur

what
proportion
of
murders
is
directly
traceable
to
drink
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
say
but
time
after
time
we
find
that
murderers
who
write
to
their
friends
state
that
drink
and
drink
only
has
caused
their
ruin
although
i
am
endeavouring
in
this
chapter
to
give
a
few
ideas
of
the
motives
for
murder
as
seen
by
the
murderers
themselves
i
am
not
by
any
means
condoning
their
crimes
my
main
object
is
to
induce
people
to
look
more
into
the
causes
of
crime
i
want
them
to
consider
whether
in
many
cases
prevention
is
not
better
than
cure
and
whether
more
can
not
be
done
to
remove
the
causes
undoubtedly
drink
has
to
answer
for
the
largest
number
of
such
crimes
after
drink
comes
lust
and
jealousy
though
these
almost
invariably
reach
the
murder
climax
through
drink
the
other
main
motive
is
the
love
of
money
which
has
led
to
many
of
the
most
heartless
inhuman
deeds
that
it
has
been
my
lot
to
avenge
i
have
given
one
or
two
instances
of
parents
who
murdered
their
own
children
for
the
sake
of
a
few
pounds
of
insurance
money
and
such
instances
could
be
multiplied
in
fact
so
apparent
did
the
motive
become
a
year
or
two
back
that
the
government
was
obliged
to
pass
a
law
regulating
the
insurance
of
the
lives
of
infants
if
such
an
act
or
even
a
one
had
been
in
existence
earlier
elizabeth
berry
might
have
been
alive
now
instead
of
lying
in
a
felon
grave
berry
poisoned
her
daughter
aged
at
the
time
of
the
murder
the
child
life
was
insured
for
for
which
berry
was
paying
a
premium
of
per
week
the
murderess
had
also
made
a
proposal
for
a
mutual
insurance
on
her
own
life
and
the
child
by
which
should
be
paid
on
the
death
of
either
to
the
survivor
she
was
under
the
impression
that
the
policy
was
completed
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
not
it
seems
almost
impossible
that
a
woman
should
murder
a
child
for
the
sake
of
gaining
even
the
full
sum
of
and
we
might
be
justified
in
believing
that
there
must
be
some
other
motive
if
it
were
not
for
the
fact
that
infanticide
has
been
committed
again
and
again
for
much
smaller
sums
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
murderers
of
children
it
would
seem
that
a
few
pounds
in
money
appears
a
sufficient
inducement
to
soil
their
hands
with
the
blood
of
a
it
is
well
therefore
for
the
sake
of
that
the
temptation
should
be
removed

chapter
x
on
capital
punishment
one
of
the
questions
which
is
most
frequently
put
to
me
is
whether
i
consider
capital
punishment
is
a
right
and
proper
thing
to
this
i
can
truly
answer
that
i
do
for
my
own
part
i
attach
much
weight
to
the
scripture
injunction
whoso
sheddeth
man
blood
by
man
shall
his
blood
be
shed
and
i
think
that
the
abolition
of
capital
punishment
would
be
a
defiance
of
the
divine
command
therefore
i
would
not
abolish
capital
punishment
altogether
but
as
i
shall
explain
later
i
would
greatly
alter
the
conditions
under
which
it
is
imposed
perhaps
many
of
my
readers
will
say
that
the
scriptural
command
should
have
no
weight
and
others
will
say
that
it
was
a
command
given
under
the
dispensation
of
law
while
we
live
under
the
dispensation
of
grace
therefore
i
would
argue
that
quite
apart
from
any
consideration
of
a
religious
nature
capital
punishment
is
absolutely
necessary
for
the
checking
of
the
greatest
criminals
in
the
discharge
of
my
duties
as
a
policeman
both
in
the
nottingham
in
the
bradford
and
in
the
west
riding
police
force
i
have
had
many
chances
of
studying
the
ways
of
life
and
thought
of
the
criminal
classes
and
i
have
paid
a
great
deal
of
attention
to
the
subject
as
the
result
of
my
experience
i
can
safely
say
that
capital
punishment
and
the
cat
are
the
only
legal
penalties
that
possess
any
real
terrors
for
the
hardened
criminal
for
the
man
who
might
be
called
a
professional
as
distinguished
from
an
amateur
ruffian
such
a
man
does
what
he
can
to
keep
out
of
prison
because
he
dislikes
restraint
and
routine
and
sobriety
but
this
dislike
is
not
strong
enough
to
deter
him
from
any
crime
which
offers
even
a
chance
of
escaping
and
i
do
not
think
that
the
fear
of
imprisonment
ever
occurs
to
him
when
he
has
once
got
criminal
work
actually
in
hand
penal
servitude
even
for
life
has
no
very
acute
terrifying
influence
partly
because
no
criminal
ever
believes
that
it
will
be
a
reality
in
his
case
as
he
feels
sure
that
he
will
get
a
commutation
of
sentence
and
partly
because
even
if
he
were
sure
that
the
imprisonment
were
actually
for
life
he
knows
that
prison
life
is
not
such
a
dreadful
fate
after
all
when
one
gets
used
to
it
but
when
it
comes
to
a
question
of
a
death
sentence
it
is
quite
another
matter
death
is
a
horrible
mystery
and
a
death
on
the
scaffold
a
and
ignominious
death
is
especially
horrible
to
the
criminal
mind
as
a
rule
the
most
desperate
criminals
are
those
who
are
most
terrified
by
the
thought
of
death
at
the
hands
of
the
executioner
possibly
because
the
most
desperate
men
spring
from
the
most
superstitious
class
of
the
community
and
have
the
greatest
dread
of
that
something
after
death
which
they
can
not
define
the
criminal
classes
do
not
neglect
their
newspapers
but
keep
themselves
pretty
well
posted
either
by
reading
or
conversation
upon
the
subjects
that
are
of
most
direct
interest
to
them
and
follow
all
the
details
of
the
most
important
criminal
trials
in
this
way
they
always
keep
more
or
less
before
them
the
thought
of
the
nature
of
capital
punishment
and
i
believe
that
it
will
be
found
that
the
number
of
capital
crimes
in
any
given
period
is
inversely
proportionate
to
the
number
of
capital
punishments
in
the
immediately
preceding
period
whenever
there
is
a
series
of
executions
without
reprieves
the
number
of
murders
decreases
and
on
the
other
hand
after
a
period
in
which
several
persons
have
been
tried
for
murder
and
acquitted
or
reprieved
after
sentence
the
number
of
crimes
appears
to
increase
i
do
not
think
that
this
rule
can
be
demonstrated
forcibly
and
convincingly
by
a
reference
to
the
mere
numbers
of
murders
convictions
reprieves
and
executions
during
the
past
few
years
because
there
are
many
considerations
which
bear
upon
the
significance
of
an
execution
or
reprieve
but
i
think
that
anyone
who
has
given
attention
to
the
subject
will
bear
me
out
in
my
contention
undoubtedly
the
fear
of
death
is
a
great
deterring
power
amongst
abandoned
men
and
the
fear
is
most
powerful
when
the
death
seems
most
certain
and
the
hope
of
reprieve
most
remote
this
consideration
leads
me
to
think
that
the
deterrent
value
of
the
death
sentence
would
be
greatly
increased
if
it
could
be
made
absolutely
irrevocable
considering
capital
punishment
as
a
moral
power
for
frightening
criminals
still
at
large
i
think
it
would
be
much
better
if
in
all
cases
where
there
is
the
slightest
possible
chance
of
reprieve
the
sentence
were
suspended
for
a
time
i
advocate
that
the
sentence
of
death
once
passed
should
be
a
sentence
which
the
doomed
man
as
well
as
his
friends
and
sympathisers
who
are
still
at
liberty
should
regard
as
quite
irrevocable
at
the
same
time
i
do
not
advocate
an
increase
in
the
number
of
executions
just
the
reverse
as
the
best
means
to
this
end
i
think
we
ought
to
have
a
considerable
alteration
in
our
criminal
law
as
it
relates
to
murder
cases
i
think
that
the
jury
should
have
more
power
over
the
sentence
and
for
this
purpose
i
think
that
they
ought
to
have
the
choice
of
five
classes
of
verdict
namely
not
guilty
not
proven
murder
in
the
third
degree
murder
in
the
second
degree
murder
in
the
first
degree
in
the
case
of
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
the
prisoner
would
of
course
be
acquitted
and
would
be
a
free
man
as
he
is
with
such
a
verdict
at
present
in
the
case
of
the
verdict
of
not
proven
it
should
be
within
the
power
of
the
judge
to
remand
the
prisoner
pending
the
further
investigation
of
any
clues
that
might
seem
likely
to
throw
light
upon
the
case
or
to
release
him
either
with
or
without
bail
or
police
supervision
a
verdict
of
murder
in
the
third
degree
would
be
brought
in
in
cases
where
there
was
undoubted
proof
of
the
crime
being
committed
by
the
prisoner
but
in
which
the
circumstances
were
such
as
to
make
it
extremely
unlikely
that
the
prisoner
would
ever
again
commit
a
violent
crime
this
would
cover
the
cases
of
people
who
shoot
their
friends
and
then
plead
that
they
did
not
think
it
was
loaded
and
would
be
a
much
better
verdict
than
the
accidental
death
which
is
generally
returned
at
present
when
the
jury
find
this
verdict
of
murder
in
the
third
degree
it
should
rest
with
the
judge
to
impose
a
term
of
imprisonment
long
or
short
according
to
the
circumstances
murder
in
the
second
degree
would
embrace
cases
in
which
the
murder
was
fully
proved
but
in
which
there
was
not
premeditation
or
intent
to
murder
under
this
head
would
come
a
number
of
deaths
resulting
from
rows
brawls
and
assaults
without
intent
to
kill
the
judge
would
have
the
power
to
pass
a
sentence
of
death
or
of
penal
servitude
for
life
murder
in
the
first
degree
in
which
both
intent
and
result
had
been
murder
would
be
a
verdict
leaving
the
judge
no
option
but
to
impose
the
death
penalty
another
question
which
ought
to
be
considered
in
this
connection
is
the
question
of
appeals
at
present
appeals
are
made
to
the
home
secretary
he
is
really
assisted
by
a
number
of
other
gentlemen
who
examine
most
thoroughly
into
the
original
evidence
and
any
additional
evidence
that
may
have
turned
up
but
this
is
a
tribunal
not
legally
appointed
and
the
public
notion
is
that
in
cases
of
appeal
the
reversal
of
the
sentence
lies
in
the
hands
of
one
man
i
do
not
think
that
even
the
most
abandoned
wretches
would
impute
any
unfairness
to
the
english
home
secretary
but
i
know
that
in
many
quarters
there
is
an
idea
that
the
home
secretary
is
a
very
kind
gentleman
who
will
let
off
if
he
possibly
can
and
such
an
idea
seems
to
be
a
very
mischievous
one
a
court
of
appeal
would
appear
less
personal
and
would
be
far
less
likely
to
be
suspected
of
leniency
if
it
consisted
of
three
judges
one
of
whom
should
be
the
judge
who
had
originally
tried
the
case
to
such
a
bench
of
judges
i
would
allow
appeals
to
be
made
and
would
give
them
power
to
cases
refer
them
back
to
the
juries
or
to
modify
sentences
but
not
to
reverse
a
jury
verdict
this
would
mean
that
in
the
case
of
a
verdict
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
the
only
way
in
which
the
execution
could
be
prevented
would
be
by
referring
the
case
back
to
the
jury
and
this
should
only
be
done
on
the
production
of
new
evidence
pointing
to
a
miscarriage
of
justice
in
the
extreme
case
of
evidence
turning
up
at
the
last
moment
the
home
secretary
should
have
power
to
grant
a
stay
of
execution
for
such
length
of
time
as
would
allow
the
bench
of
judges
to
the
case
the
drawing
up
and
presentation
of
petitions
by
people
who
are
in
no
way
connected
with
the
case
would
to
a
great
extent
be
done
away
with
under
such
a
system
as
i
have
outlined
but
in
order
to
provide
for
cases
where
the
system
might
not
have
this
effect
i
would
make
it
a
punishable
offence
to
attempt
to
influence
the
decision
of
the
judges
or
jurymen
by
an
appeal
to
any
consideration
other
than
the
evidence
this
advice
i
give
because
in
so
many
nay
in
most
cases
the
appeals
contained
in
petitions
are
based
upon
considerations
other
than
the
justice
of
the
case
if
the
condemned
person
is
an
interesting
character
or
if
there
is
any
sort
of
excuse
upon
which
an
appeal
can
be
based
there
are
always
a
great
number
of
people
who
have
no
special
knowledge
of
the
case
and
who
perhaps
have
not
even
read
the
newspaper
reports
who
are
ready
to
get
up
petitions
collect
signatures
and
stir
up
a
lot
of
sympathy
for
one
who
too
often
deserves
nothing
but
execration
and
contempt
such
agitations
lead
to
much
misrepresentation
of
facts
and
often
to
sweeping
condemnations
of
the
judge
and
jury
they
tend
to
infuse
in
the
minds
of
young
people
especially
an
incorrect
notion
that
the
administration
of
the
law
is
uncertain
and
ineffectual
even
if
it
is
not
unjust
and
corrupt
the
mere
fact
of
the
extent
to
which
the
consideration
of
loathsome
crimes
and
their
punishment
is
brought
under
the
notice
of
children
by
this
system
of
petitions
is
in
my
mind
sufficient
argument
for
its
complete
suppression
one
case
i
might
instance
in
which
the
masters
of
two
public
schools
led
the
whole
of
the
children
under
their
charge
through
an
in
which
a
petition
was
lying
and
made
them
all
sign
it
in
turn
this
kind
of
thing
occurs
whenever
a
petition
praying
for
a
sentence
of
death
to
be
reversed
or
commuted
is
in
the
course
of
signature
and
surely
such
a
thing
should
not
be
possible
in
many
cases
the
people
who
draw
up
these
petitions
are
people
who
object
on
principle
to
all
capital
punishment
but
unfortunately
the
principle
is
entirely
lost
to
sight
when
dealing
with
individual
cases
the
fact
of
big
petitions
being
presented
in
one
case
while
no
effort
is
made
in
another
case
with
similar
features
naturally
leads
uneducated
people
to
think
that
there
is
uncertainty
and
injustice
about
the
whole
affair
there
is
still
one
other
respect
in
which
i
think
that
our
law
with
reference
to
murder
and
the
death
penalty
ought
to
be
altered
and
that
is
with
regard
to
the
length
of
time
allowed
to
elapse
between
sentence
and
execution
in
the
interests
of
all
concerned
i
would
reduce
the
time
from
three
clear
weeks
as
at
present
to
one
week
only
no
doubt
many
readers
will
cry
out
against
this
as
an
unnecessary
cruelty
to
the
condemned
but
i
say
that
i
would
do
it
in
the
interests
of
after
full
consideration
and
an
unusually
full
knowledge
of
the
ideas
of
the
condemned
upon
the
subject
it
is
not
a
shorter
time
that
would
be
a
cruelty
the
present
long
time
is
where
the
real
cruelty
comes
in
so
far
as
i
know
the
three
weeks
grace
given
to
the
condemned
man
is
intended
as
a
time
for
repentance
and
for
attending
to
the
affairs
of
the
soul
therefore
the
question
of
allowing
a
long
or
short
time
is
to
a
great
extent
a
religious
one
and
dangerous
for
me
to
tackle
so
i
will
confine
my
remarks
as
far
as
possible
to
matters
of
fact
and
mere
considerations
if
the
only
purpose
of
the
time
allowed
between
sentence
and
execution
is
to
admit
of
conversion
and
a
preparation
for
heaven
it
is
fair
to
ask
of
anyone
who
wishes
to
continue
the
present
system
whether
it
serves
the
purpose
if
not
there
would
seem
to
be
no
valid
argument
in
favour
of
its
continuance
personally
i
am
convinced
by
long
experience
that
the
hope
of
regeneration
during
three
weeks
in
the
case
of
murderers
is
absolutely
vain
there
are
many
instances
in
which
the
criminal
becomes
penitent
as
it
is
sometimes
termed
and
these
penitents
may
be
divided
into
two
classes
firstly
there
is
the
class
of
those
who
have
committed
murder
without
intent
or
premeditation
in
a
fit
of
frenzy
or
under
peculiar
circumstances
they
have
killed
a
human
being
it
may
be
a
mother
who
has
killed
the
baby
she
could
not
feed
or
a
man
who
in
a
whirlwind
of
temper
has
killed
the
unfaithful
and
miserable
wife
whose
conduct
has
made
his
life
a
hell
upon
earth
for
years
it
may
be
many
another
similar
case
which
under
the
scheme
of
five
possible
verdicts
propounded
above
would
be
returned
as
murder
in
the
second
or
third
degree
under
such
a
law
the
extreme
penalty
would
not
be
imposed
but
while
we
are
under
our
present
law
and
supposing
that
these
persons
are
condemned
without
chance
of
reprieve
we
may
fairly
ask
whether
the
three
weeks
grace
is
an
advantage
to
them
such
criminals
are
truly
repentant
or
rather
remorseful
as
a
rule
the
enormity
of
the
crime
bursts
upon
them
in
the
first
calm
moment
after
its
commission
they
recoil
in
horror
from
the
deed
they
have
done
and
would
gladly
sacrifice
anything
even
life
itself
to
undo
that
deed
again
there
is
true
repentance
which
i
take
it
is
the
key
to
forgiveness
even
before
their
apprehension
and
condemnation
everything
that
can
be
done
on
earth
by
or
for
such
poor
souls
can
be
done
in
a
week
and
they
would
not
ask
for
more
their
repentance
is
sincere
their
horror
of
their
crime
is
greater
than
their
dread
of
death
which
they
welcome
as
a
means
of
expiation
is
any
good
purpose
served
by
keeping
such
people
for
three
weeks
in
agony
the
second
class
of
penitents
consists
of
a
horrible
section
of
humanity
the
cowardly
desperadoes
these
are
usually
men
whose
crimes
have
shown
a
refinement
of
cruelty
and
callousness
that
is
positively
revolting
they
are
the
hardened
or
professional
criminals
whose
hearts
are
devoid
of
pity
or
remorse
and
equally
devoid
of
the
least
spark
of
courage
they
are
the
miserable
men
whose
lives
have
been
spent
in
defying
and
blaspheming
god
but
who
when
they
see
death
before
them
whine
and
howl
and
beg
for
the
intercession
of
the
chaplain
or
any
other
godly
person
they
may
meet
with
not
because
they
repent
of
their
sins
but
because
they
are
frightened
almost
to
death
by
the
thought
of
a
fiery
hell
which
has
been
painted
before
their
imaginations
in
glowing
colours
to
such
men
as
these
i
am
sure
that
the
shortening
of
the
waiting
time
would
be
the
greatest
possible
mercy
for
the
longer
time
only
gives
them
opportunity
to
work
themselves
into
an
almost
demented
state
at
the
end
of
three
weeks
they
are
often
so
broken
down
and
hysterical
as
to
be
incapable
of
correctly
understanding
anything
and
their
only
remaining
feeling
is
a
wild
frantic
dread
of
the
scaffold
besides
the
two
classes
of
penitents
there
only
remains
the
class
who
are
not
penitent
at
all
they
are
mostly
men
who
have
been
long
acquainted
with
crime
who
have
made
it
the
business
of
their
lives
they
look
upon
the
law
and
its
officers
much
as
a
business
man
looks
upon
a
clever
and
unscrupulous
competitor
and
upon
a
sentence
of
death
as
one
of
the
business
risks
life
ends
for
them
not
at
the
scaffold
but
in
the
dock
when
sentence
is
pronounced
from
that
time
they
sink
into
a
state
of
sullen
indifference
or
take
up
any
occupation
that
may
offer
merely
to
kill
time
in
some
cases
they
take
to
bible
reading
and
prayers
because
they
think
it
ca
do
any
harm
and
may
do
a
bit
of
good
and
because
they
have
nothing
else
to
do
no
one
can
say
that
such
men
are
penitent
since
on
release
they
would
return
to
their
vicious
ways
they
would
not
be
likely
to
reach
any
better
state
if
they
were
allowed
to
live
three
months
instead
of
three
weeks
for
the
only
regret
that
they
can
be
brought
to
feel
is
personal
and
purely
selfish
it
is
founded
on
fear
of
hell
and
is
not
a
contrition
for
having
committed
the
crime
but
a
regret
that
the
crime
carries
with
it
a
punishment
in
the
next
world
convicts
of
this
class
when
they
have
no
hope
of
reprieve
do
not
thank
us
for
the
three
weeks
of
life
that
are
given
to
them
if
they
could
have
their
own
choice
they
would
prefer
to
walk
straight
from
the
dock
to
the
scaffold
and
to
get
it
over
at
once
in
every
case
if
the
matter
is
thoroughly
inquired
into
on
lines
of
common
sense
instead
of
mere
sentiment
i
think
the
conclusion
will
be
that
the
three
weeks
allowed
are
no
advantage
whatever
to
the
convicts
in
most
cases
their
position
would
be
decidedly
improved
by
reducing
the
time
there
are
other
distinct
advantages
to
be
gained
by
reducing
the
interval
in
the
first
place
it
would
greatly
improve
the
moral
effect
of
the
death
sentence
retribution
following
directly
after
conviction
is
a
distinct
object
lesson
and
the
shorter
the
time
between
the
more
obvious
is
the
connection
between
the
crime
and
the
punishment
when
even
three
weeks
elapse
the
connection
is
often
lost
in
the
second
place
the
alteration
i
advocate
would
greatly
prevent
the
stirring
up
of
false
sentiment
in
favour
of
convicts
who
happen
to
have
an
interesting
personality
it
would
put
a
stop
to
the
petition
signing
which
is
often
indulged
in
by
people
who
know
nothing
of
the
case
but
who
are
worked
upon
to
express
sympathy
with
the
convict
and
want
of
faith
in
the
justice
of
our
system
of
trial
if
only
a
week
elapsed
between
sentence
and
execution
the
facts
of
the
trial
and
details
of
the
evidence
would
remain
fresher
in
the
public
mind
and
people
would
be
less
liable
to
be
led
to
mistrust
the
justice
of
the
sentence
to
all
the
people
who
have
charge
of
the
convicts
before
execution
a
shortening
of
the
time
would
be
a
great
blessing
for
such
a
charge
is
often
a
experience
the
chaplains
especially
whose
experiences
are
often
most
unpleasant
and
whose
earnest
efforts
meet
with
such
disappointing
return
would
i
think
welcome
the
change

i
have
stated
in

ii
the
reasons
which
led
me
to
take
the
office
of
executioner
the
reader
will
remember
that
i
then
claimed
no
higher
motive
than
a
desire
to
obtain
a
living
for
my

by
an
honest
trade
i
am
not
ashamed
of
my
calling
because
i
consider
that
if
it
is
right
for
men
to
be
executed
which
i
believe
it
is
in
murder
cases
it
is
right
that

should

held
respectable

i
first
took
up
the
work
i
was
in
the
habit
of
applying
to
the
sheriff
of
the
county
whenever
a
murderer
was
condemned
to
death
i
no
longer
consider
it
necessary
to
apply
for

i
am
now
well
known
but
i
still
send
a
simple
address
card
as
above
when
an
execution
in
ireland
is
announced
in
the
earlier
days
i
made
application
on
a
regular
printed
form
which
gave
the
terms
and
left
no
opening
for
mistake
or
misunderstanding
of
this
form
i
give
a

still

james

the

sheriff
for
the
county
of
there
are
on
an
average
some
twenty
executions
annually
so
that
the
reader
can
calculate
pretty
nearly
what
is
my
remuneration
for
a
work
which
carries
with
it
a
great
deal
of
popular
odium
which
is
in
many
ways
disagreeable
and
which
may
be
accompanied
as
it
has
been
in
my
own
experience
by
serious
danger
resulting
in
permanent
bodily
injury
it
will
be
seen
that
the
net
commission
is
not
by
any
means
an
exorbitant
annual
sum
considering
all
the
circumstances
of
the

and
that
it
does
not
approach
the
amount
which
some
people
have
stated
that
i
was
able
to
earn

my
earnings
are
entirely
uncertain
since
they
wholly
depend
upon
the
number
of
executions
and
this
arrangement
by
which
my
livelihood
depends
upon
the
number
of
poor
fellows
condemned
to
die
is
to
me
the
most
repugnant
feature
of
my
work
it
seems
a
horrible
thing
that
i
should
have
to
peruse
newspaper
reports
in
the
hope
that
a
may
be
condemned
to
death
whenever
i
wish
to
feel
sure
that
business
is
not
falling
off
and
that
i
should
have
to
regard
as
evil
days
and
hard
times
those
periods
when
there
seem
to
be
lulls
in
the
annals
of
crime
and
when
one
might
reasonably
hope
that
a
better
state
of
things
was
dawning
in
the
land

considerations
and
the
more
selfish

have
led
me
to
strongly
approve
of
the
suggestion
that
the
executioner
office
should
be
a
government
appointment
with
a
fixed
salary
instead
of
an
uncertain
commission
when
the
committee
on
capital
punishment
was
sitting
early
in
i
expressed
my
views
on
this
matter
in
a
letter
addressed
to
the
president
of
the
committee
lord
aberdare
i
am
not
without
hope
that
a
change
in
the
arrangements
for
regulating
the
office
of
executioner
will
ere
long
be
made
and
the
lines
on
which
i
think
that
it
might
be
most
reasonably
and
satisfactorily
done
are
set
forth
in
the
letter
to
lord
aberdare
which
i
append
bilton
place
city
road
bradford
my
lord
i
have
been
for
some
time
past
in
correspondence
with
howard
vincent
for
sheffield
with
reference
to
alteration
in
the
mode
of
remunerating
my
services
in
carrying
into
effect
the
sentence
of
the
law
upon
criminals
convicted
of
capital
crimes
howard
vincent
has
suggested
that
i
should
address
myself
to
the
honourable
committee
on
capital
punishment
through
your
lordship
as
their
president
i
would
therefore
respectfully
point
out
to
your
lordship
and
your
honourable
committee
that
the
present
mode
of
payment
for
my
services
is
unsatisfactory
and
undesirable
and
that
a
change
is
needed
as
your
lordship
is
doubtless
aware
under
the
existing
arrangements
i
am
paid
the
sum
of
together
with
travelling
and
other
incidental
expenses
for
each
execution
conducted
by
me
there
are
on
an
average
roughly
speaking
executions
yearly
what
i
would
respectfully
suggest
is
that
instead
of
this
payment
by
commission
i
should
receive
a
fixed
salary
from
the
government
of
per
annum
i
may
say
that
since
accepting
the
appointment
i
have
never
received
less
than
in
any
one
year
i
am
informed
that
in
determining
a
fixed
salary
or
compensation
in
lieu
of
a
payment
by
commission
the
average
annual
amount
received
is
made
the
basis
for
the
calculation
it
will
be
apparent
to
your
lordship
that
an
offer
of
a
sum
than
the
former
average
would
not
be
sufficiently
advantageous
to
induce
me
to
exchange
the
old
system
for
the
new
i
may
further
with
your
lordship
permission
draw
attention
to
the
peculiar
social
position
in
which
i
am
placed
by
reason
of
holding
the
office
before
referred
to
i
am
to
a
great
extent
alone
in
the
world
as
a
certain
social
ostracism
is
attendant
upon
such
office
and
extends
not
to
myself
alone
but
also
includes
the
members
of
my
family
it
therefore
becomes
extremely
desirable
that
my
children
should
for
their
own
sakes
be
sent
to
a
school
away
from
this
town
to
do
this
of
course
would
entail
serious
expenditure
only
to
be
incurred
in
the
event
of
my
being
able
to
rely
on
a
fixed
source
of
income
less
liable
to
variation
than
the
present
remuneration
by
commission
alone
i
am
also
unable
for
obvious
reasons
to
obtain
any
other
employment
my
situation
as
boot
salesman
held
by
me
previous
to
my
acceptance
of
the
office
of
executioner
had
to
be
given
up
on
that
account
alone
my
employer
having
no
fault
to
find
with
me
but
giving
that
as
the
sole
reason
for
dispensing
with
my
services
my
late
employer
will
give
me
a
good
reference
as
to
general
character
and
the
governors
of
gaols
in
which
i
have
conducted
executions
will
be
ready
to
speak
as
to
my
steadiness
and
also
my
ability
and
skill
on
performing
the
duties
devolving
upon
me
in
conclusion
i
should
be
ready
to
give
and
call
evidence
on
the
points
hereinbefore
referred
to
if
it
should
seem
fit
to
your
lordship
and
your
honourable
committee
on
receiving
a
notification
to
that
effect
under
these
circumstances
i
trust
that
your
lordship
will
be
able
to
see
the
way
clear
to
embody
in
your
honourable
report
a
recommendation
to
the
effect
that
a
fixed
annual
sum
of
should
be
paid
me
for
my
services
rendered
in
the
office
of
executioner
i
have
the
honour
to
be
your
lordship
obedient
humble
servant
james
berry
to
the
right
honourable
lord
aberdare
president
capital
punishment
committee
whitehall
london
if
your
honourable
committee
has
an
alternative
to
the
foregoing
proposal
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
i
am
permanently
retained
by
the
home
office
at
a
nominal
sum
of
a
year
exclusive
of
fees
at
present
paid
to
me
by
sheriffs
of
different
counties
and
the
usual
expenses
in
connection
with
this
subject
i
should
like
to
point
out
that
in
asking
for
the
office
of
executioner
to
be
made
a
recognised
and
permanent
appointment
i
am
not
suggesting
any
new
thing
but
merely
a
return
to
the
conditions
in
force
not
much
more
than
fifteen
years
ago
up
to
the
executioner
was
a
permanently
established
and
recognised
official
calcraft
the
last
who
occupied
this
position
was
retained
by
the
sheriffs
of
the
city
of
london
with
a
fee
of
per
week
and
also
had
a
retainer
from
horsemonger
lane
gaol
in
addition
to
his
fees
he
had
various
perquisites
which
made
these
two
appointments
alone
sufficient
for
his
decent
maintenance
and
he
also
undertook
executions
all
over
the
country
for
which
he
was
paid
at
about
the
same
rate
as
i
am
at
present
but
with
perquisites
in
all
cases
in
he
retired
and
the
city
of
london
allowed
him
a
pension
of
shillings
a
week
for
life
calcraft
successor
was
wm
marwood
who
had
no
official
status
he
had
a
retaining
fee
of
a
year
from
the
sheriffs
of
the
city
of
london
but
beyond
that
he
had
to
depend
upon
the
fees
for
individual
executions
and
reprieves
in
his
time
also
there
were
considerable
perquisites
for
instance
the
clothing
and
personal
property
possessed
by
the
criminal
at
the
time
of
his
execution
became
the
property
of
the
executioner
these
relics
were
often
sold
for
really
fancy
prices
and
formed
no
mean
item
in
the
annual
takings
but
the
sale
and
exhibition
of
such
curiosities
were
only
pandering
to
a
morbid
taste
on
the
part
of
some
sections
of
the
public
and
it
was
ordered
by
the
government
very
rightly
from
a
public
point
of
view
but
very
unfortunately
for
the
executioner
that
personal
property
left
by
the
criminals
should
be
burned
in
many
other
countries
the
post
of
executioner
is
permanent
in
some
cases
it
is
hereditary
as
in
france
where
it
has
remained
in
the
deibler
family
passing
from
sire
to
son
for
a
great
length
of
time
even
in
british
territory
at
the
present
time
a
permanent
official
hangsman
is
not
entirely
unknown
for
in
malta
the
post
is
a
definite
appointment
to
which
a
salary
of
is
attached
in
england
the
sheriff
is
the
officer
appointed
to
carry
out
the
executions
and
though
he
is
allowed
to
employ
a
substitute
if
he
can
find
one
it
would
fall
to
him
to
personally
conduct
the
execution
if
no
substitute
could
be
obtained
in
certain
cases
in
days
gone
by
there
has
been
very
great
difficulty
in
securing
anyone
who
would
undertake
the
unpleasant
duty
though
i
do
not
remember
any
recorded
instance
of
the
sheriff
being
absolutely
unable
to
engage
an
executioner
chapter
xii
the
press
and
the
public
i
might
almost
head
this
chapter
my
critics
for
both
press
and
public
are
constantly
criticising
my
doings
the
criticism
is
generally
friendly
though
often
based
on
incomplete
knowledge
of
the
facts
of
the
i
must
say
that
they
usually
seem
most
kindly
disposed
and
certainly
many
of
them
go
to
great
trouble
to
extract
from
me
a
few
statements
which
they
can
spin
out
into
an
interview
as
a
rule
i
dislike
these
interviews
for
i
know
that
my
employers
very
strongly
object
to
any
more
sensationalism
than
is
absolutely
necessary
being
imported
into
the
accounts
of
executions
unfortunately
with
many
of
the
papers
sensationalism
is
the
one
thing
needful
and
when
i
meet
with
a
really
energetic
reporter
attached
to
such
a
paper
my
position
is
a
very
difficult
one
if
i
say
little
or
nothing
in
answer
to
his
questions
he
may
spin
a
fearful
and
wonderful
yarn
out
of
his
own
head
and
out
of
the
gossip
and
rumours
which
seem
to
be
constantly
afloat
started
i
imagine
by
needy
on
the
other
hand
if
i
submit
to
the
interview
as
the
best
way
of
keeping
it
within
bounds
the
touches
of
colour
which
the
interviewer
generally
thinks
it
necessary
to
add
are
pretty
sure
to
land
me
in
bother
and
misunderstanding
in
several
instances
statements
which
were
calculated
to
seriously
injure
me
professionally
have
been
published
and
though
i
believe
they
were
inserted
with
no
evil
intent
i
have
been
obliged
to
employ
my
solicitors
to
secure
their
contradiction
the
instance
which
annoyed
me
perhaps
more
than
any
other
was
the
reporting
of
a
supposed
interview
in
the
county
it
was
said
to
be
from
an
occasional
contributor
the
interviewer
in
question
tackled
me
in
the
hotel
where
the
sheriff
pays
the
execution
fee
entering
the
room
immediately
after
i
had
been
paid
and
just
as
the
sheriff
was
driving
off
he
asked
me
two
or
three
questions
about
private
matters
which
i
answered
truthfully
and
straightforwardly
though
i
was
somewhat
annoyed
by
the
man
and
his
manner
the
interview
which
appeared
quite
shocked
me
several
of
the
statements
were
utterly
wrong
but
what
troubled
me
most
was
the
following
paragraph
which
was
quite
at
variance
with
the
actual
facts
and
with
the
statements
which
i
had
made
and
what
do
your
friends
think
of
the
profession
you
have
taken
up
i
asked
it
killed
my
mother
and
brother
he
mournfully
replied
when
marwood
died
i
was
appointed
in
his
place
and
directly
my
mother
knew
of
it
she
was
taken
my
father
solicitor
then
wrote
to
the
home
office
informing
the
authorities
of
this
the
result
was
that
i
gave
up
the
position
and
binns
got
the
appointment
my
mother
died
soon
afterwards
though
and
then
when
i
saw
the
way
in
which
binns
was
going
on
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
would
not
hold
the
place
long
and
i
again
wrote
to
the
home
office
stating
that
my
mother
was
dead
and
that
there
was
nothing
now
to
prevent
my
accommodating
them
if
my
assistance
should
be
required
soon
after
that
i
was
engaged
to
hang
two
men
at
edinburgh
and
i
have
carried
out
nearly
all
the
executions
since
then
my
brother
had
married
a
girl
with
plenty
of
money
and
his
pride
received
a
blow
on
my
appointment
that
was
the
cause
of
his
death
he
was
a
liberal
and
in
favour
of
abolishing
capital
punishment
but
i
am
a
conservative
through
and
through
altogether
i
have
buried
my
mother
two
brothers
and
two
aunts
within
the
last
three
years
this
was
a
false
and
cruel
paragraph
the
actual
facts
with
regard
to
the
deaths
of
my
relatives
being
as
follows
my
aunts
died
before
i
took
the
office
or
thought
of
doing
so
my
mother
died
from
cancer
on
the
liver
from
which
she
had
been
suffering
for
a
long
time
before
i
applied
for
the
post
and
she
died
between
the
time
of
my
first
application
and
the
time
of
second
application
when
i
was
appointed
for
the
double
execution
at
edinburgh
my
brother
died
of
low
fever
after
i
had
held
the
office
of
executioner
for
about
four
years
i
do
not
wish
to
deny
that
my
choice
of
the
calling
of
executioner
was
a
disappointment
and
annoyance
to
my
family
but
to
say
that
it
caused
or
hastened
the
death
of
any
one
of
them
is
to
say
that
which
is
not
true
if
i
thought
that
it
had
really
had
any
such
disastrous
effect
i
hope
i
am
not
such
a
callous
and
hardened
wretch
as
to
make
the
matter
the
subject
of
discussion
with
a
stranger
one
would
almost
have
thought
that
such
statements
as
the
one
extracted
above
would
bear
their
refutation
on
their
face
and
that
there
would
be
no
need
to
contradict
them
but
the
matter
was
seriously
taken
up
by
the
which
made
it
the
subject
of
a
leader
and
other
papers
all
over
the
country
extracted
from
or
commented
upon
the
matter
in
the
of
course
i
put
the
matter
into
the
hands
of
my
solicitors
who
took
steps
to
stop
the
original
libel
but
they
were
naturally
unable
to
stop
its
circulation
through
the
country
another
affair
which
caused
me
much
annoyance
at
the
time
arose
in
hereford
from
the
greed
for
interesting
and
sensational
copy
shown
by
a
member
of
the
staff
of
the
he
got
up
some
sensational
matter
to
the
effect
that
after
the
execution
of
hill
and
williams
i
retired
to
a
neighbouring
hotel
where
a
smoking
concert
was
in
progress
and
there
held
a
ghastly
levee
the
worst
of
this
report
was
that
it
was
based
on
some
foundation
of
fact
and
that
a
mere
colouration
of
the
report
made
a
reasonable
and
perfectly
innocent
entertainment
appear
as
if
it
was
something
shameful
the
actual
facts
were
that
after
the
execution
i
was
in
company
with
alderman
barnet
mayor
of
worcester
and
a
detective
sergeant
both
of
whom
were
personal
friends
of
mine
with
alderman
barnet
i
was
invited
to
a
social
evening
held
by
some
of
his
friends
it
was
a
perfectly
private
party
and
was
decorously
conducted
in
every
way
when
the
representative
appeared
as
he
was
known
to
the
gentlemen
present
he
was
invited
to
join
us
simply
as
a
friend
the
report
of
the
party
was
much
talked
about
at
the
time
and
sir
edwin
lechmere
for
hereford
made
it
the
subject
of
a
question
in
the
house
of
commons
from
time
to
time
a
very
great
number
of
incorrect
and
exaggerated
statements
have
been
made
in
the
press
with
regard
to
almost
every
detail
of
my
work
and
i
suppose
that
so
long
as
the
public
have
a
love
for
the
marvellous
and
so
long
as
have
treacherous
memories
or
vivid
imaginations
it
will
continue
to
be
so
my
enormous
income
is
one
of
the
subjects
on
which
the
papers
most
frequently
get
astray
and
it
has
often
been
asserted
that
my
earnings
amounted
to
a
thousand
a
year
i
only
wish
that
it
might
be
so
if
i
could
make
it
from
an
increase
of
fee
rather
than
an
increase
in
the
number
of
executions
but
the
reader
has
in
other
places
correct
statements
of
what
my
income
really
amounts
to
i
never
bear
malice
against
my
friends
of
the
press
for
these
little
distortions
of
fact
for
i
know
that
they
mean
no
harm
and
on
the
whole
they
have
always
used
me
very
well
with
regard
to
the
public
their
curiosity
to
see
me
is
much
greater
than
my
desire
to
satisfy
it
i
have
no
wish
to
be
followed
about
and
stared
at
by
a
crowd
as
if
i
were
a
monstrosity
and
in
many
cases
i
have
had
to
go
to
some
trouble
to
baulk
them
this
i
can
do
to
a
certain
extent
by
travelling
by
other
trains
than
the
one
i
am
expected
by
in
some
cases
where
there
are
two
or
three
railways
into
a
town
one
of
which
is
the
direct
line
from
bradford
i
take
the
direct
line
to
some
local
station
and
there
change
into
a
train
of
another
line
or
into
some
train
running
on
some
local
branch
line
and
so
arrive
unobserved
at
newcastle
after
the
execution
of
judge
there
was
a
big
and
enthusiastic
crowd
waiting
to
see
me
and
my
assistant
depart
there
were
one
or
two
men
in
the
crowd
who
knew
me
by
sight
and
they
knew
the
train
by
which
we
were
to
travel
so
they
made
a
raid
on
the
station
and
in
spite
of
the
efforts
of
the
railway
officials
and
police
to
keep
the
place
clear
they
burst
through
the
barriers
with
a
howl
of
exultation
and
filled
the
platform
the
plan
by
which
we
evaded
them
was
very
simple
we
walked
over
the
river
to
gateshead
and
booked
from
there
to
newcastle
arriving
by
train
in
the
midst
of
the
people
who
were
looking
for
us
we
attracted
no
attention
whatever
because
the
folks
who
knew
me
were
near
the
entrance
gates
expecting
us
to
come
into
the
station
in
the
ordinary
way
as
we
had
our
tickets
for
bradford
with
us
we
simply
crossed
the
platform
to
our
own
train
and
in
due
time
steamed
southward
leaving
the
disappointed
crowd
under
the
firm
impression
that
we
had
not
entered
the
station
the
first
time
that
i
went
to
swansea
there
was
a
large
crowd
of
people
waiting
to
see
me
but
they
were
disappointed
for
i
had
made
a
little
arrangement
which
completely
upset
their
calculations
it
happened
that
i
travelled
from
shrewsbury
to
swansea
with
a
gentleman
who
is
well
known
in
the
latter
town
in
the
train
we
entered
into
conversation
and
i
found
that
his
carriage
was
to
meet
him
at
the
station
i
therefore
asked
him
if
he
could
recommend
me
to
a
good
hotel
and
was
delighted
when
he
said
that
he
would
drive
me
to
one
which
was
just
what
i
wanted
he
did
not
know
who
i
was
and
the
little
crowd
that
was
watching
never
imagined
that
the
executioner
would
be
riding
in
their
townsman
carriage
of
course
i
did
not
want
to
stay
at
the
hotel
because
i
was
to
lodge
in
the
gaol
but
i
thanked
my
friend
for
the
lift
walked
into
the
hotel
for
a
glass
of
beer
while
he
was
driving
away
and
then
walked
up
to
the
prison
without
anyone
suspecting
my
errand
whenever
i
have
been
in
actual
contact
with
crowds
in
england
their
attitude
has
been
friendly
in
ireland
such
knots
of
people
as
may
gather
are
usually
the
reverse
in
england
if
there
is
any
sort
of
demonstration
it
is
a
cheer
in
ireland
it
is
hooting
and
groaning
but
it
is
seldom
in
england
that
i
meet
with
any
personal
demonstration
the
crowds
that
assemble
outside
the
gaols
when
executions
are
in
progress
are
interesting
studies
they
hail
the
hoisting
of
the
black
flag
with
a
cheer
or
a
groan
that
indicates
their
opinion
of
the
merits
of
the
case
it
is
curious
to
notice
how
the
sympathies
of
this
section
of
the
public
lean
one
way
or
the
other
often
without
any
apparent
reason
this
thought
occurred
to
me
very
forcibly
at
the
executions
of
israel
lipski
and
william
hunter
who
were
hanged
within
a
few
months
of
each
other
illustration
israel
lipski
at
lipski
execution
the
crowd
was
the
largest
i
have
ever
seen
many
of
the
people
remained
hanging
about
for
hours
the
excitement
was
intense
but
there
was
no
sympathy
for
the
prisoner
there
were
many
jews
in
the
crowd
and
wherever
they
were
noticed
they
were
hustled
and
kicked
about
and
insulted
in
every
imaginable
manner
for
the
hatred
displayed
by
the
mob
was
extended
from
lipski
to
his
race
when
the
black
flag
was
hoisted
it
was
received
with
three
ringing
cheers
altogether
the
crowd
showed
the
utmost
detestation
of
the
murderer
and
yet
his
crime
was
no
worse
than
the
majority
of
murders
and
there
were
many
things
connected
with
it
and
with
the
circumstances
of
the
miserable
man
life
both
before
and
after
which
i
should
have
expected
to
excite
some
little
sympathy
at
any
rate
amongst
people
in
a
similar
station
of
life
hunter
execution
was
the
next
but
one
to
lipski
and
his
crime
was
one
which
has
always
seemed
to
me
about
the
most
heartless
i
ever
heard
of
hunter
was
a
striker
in
a
foundry
by
trade
but
a
tramp
by
choice
he
left
his
wife
and
two
children
and
went
on
tramp
eventually
striking
up
a
sort
of
partnership
with
a
scotch
woman
who
had
six
illegitimate
children
one
of
these
a
little
girl
between
three
and
four
years
of
age
went
tramping
with
them
and
of
course
the
poor
wee
mite
was
utterly
unfit
for
the
exposure
and
the
many
miles
of
walking
which
they
made
her
accomplish
daily
hunter
and
the
woman
were
both
cruel
to
the
child
and
carried
their
cruelty
to
such
an
extent
that
on
one
occasion
at
any
rate
they
were
remonstrated
with
and
eventually
turned
out
of
a
common
on
account
of
their
conduct
at
last
one
day
after
a
long
tramp
the
little
mite
began
to
cry
from
weariness
and
hunter
to
stop
her
crying
beat
her
with
a
switch
later
for
the
same
purpose
he
thrashed
her
with
a
stick
that
he
picked
up
in
the
road
still
later
in
the
day
he
continued
his
until
he
had
beaten
the
life
out
of
the
poor
little
creature
in
justice
to
the
man
or
brute
it
should
be
said
that
when
he
found
that
the
child
was
insensible
it
was
really
dead
he
fetched
water
to
bathe
its
poor
battered
head
and
when
he
realised
that
it
was
dead
he
cut
his
own
throat
and
very
nearly
killed
himself
but
these
considerations
seem
very
little
extenuation
for
the
harsh
brutality
of
his
conduct
one
would
have
thought
that
the
man
who
had
thus
heartlessly
tortured
to
death
a
helpless
child
would
have
been
execrated
by
all
men
yet
the
crowd
that
assembled
at
execution
wore
quite
a
holiday
air
there
were
some
people
most
of
whom
laughed
and
jested
when
the
flag
was
run
up
there
was
no
demonstration
perhaps
the
carlisle
people
are
not
demonstrative
however
that
may
be
the
contrasted
conduct
of
the
crowds
at
the
two
executions
struck
me
forcibly
and
though
it
is
sad
that
men
should
rejoice
at
the
death
of
a
if
the
cheers
had
been
given
at
hunter
death
which
greeted
the
death
of
lipski
i
think
they
would
have
been
more
natural
and
more
english
than
light
jests
and
laughter
chapter
xiii
incidents
and
anecdotes
as
is
always
the
case
when
a
man
attains
any
prominence
or
notoriety
a
number
of
utterly
groundless
stories
have
got
afloat
about
my
doings
and
adventures
others
which
were
originally
founded
on
fact
have
been
so
modified
and
altered
that
i
do
not
recognise
them
when
they
come
back
to
me
again
altogether
i
have
been
credited
with
being
the
hero
of
so
many
surprising
adventures
that
i
am
afraid
the
few
little
incidents
which
have
really
occurred
to
me
will
seem
tame
by
the
side
of
the
fictions
one
of
the
most
striking
incidents
that
ever
occurred
to
me
was
on
the
journey
from
lincoln
to
durham
after
executing
mary
lefley
in
at
doncaster
we
changed
from
the
great
eastern
to
the
great
northern
railway
i
looked
out
for
a
carriage
with
a
vacant
corner
seat
and
got
into
one
containing
three
men
when
the
train
had
started
they
began
to
talk
amongst
themselves
and
to
look
at
me
and
eventually
began
to
chaff
me
of
course
i
pretended
not
to
understand
their
allusions
to
the
execution
that
morning
and
was
indignant
at
their
supposing
me
to
be
an
executioner
but
they
were
confident
that
they
were
right
and
began
offering
to
bet
amongst
themselves
as
to
which
of
them
i
should
get
first
i
was
glad
to
get
to
york
where
i
parted
from
their
company
two
years
afterwards
i
met
the
same
three
men
under
very
different
circumstances
they
were
at
carlisle
condemned
to
be
executed
for
the
netherby
hall
burglary
and
i
carried
out
the
sentence
of
the
law
their
names
were
rudge
martin
and
baker
i
always
try
to
remain
unknown
while
travelling
but
there
is
a
certain
class
of
people
who
will
always
crowd
round
as
if
an
executioner
were
a
on
the
journey
above
mentioned
after
changing
at
york
i
got
into
a
carriage
with
a
old
gentleman
a
little
crowd
collected
round
the
door
and
just
as
we
were
starting
a
porter
stuck
his
head
into
the
window
pointed
to
my
and
with
a
silly
attempt
at
jocularity
said
i
hope
you
give
him
the
right
tightener
the
old
gentleman
seemed
much
mystified
and
of
course
i
was
quite
unable
to
imagine
what
it
meant
at
darlington
there
was
another
little
crowd
which
collected
for
a
short
time
about
our
carriage
fortunately
none
of
the
people
knew
me
so
that
when
the
old
gentleman
asked
them
what
was
the
matter
they
could
only
tell
him
that
berry
was
travelling
by
that
train
and
that
they
wanted
to
have
a
look
at
him
the
old
gentleman
seemed
anxious
to
see
such
an
awful
man
as
the
executioner
and
asked
me
if
i
should
know
him
if
i
saw
him
i
pointed
out
a
character
as
being
possibly
the
man
and
my
said
yes
very
much
like
him
i
suppose
he
had
seen
a
portrait
of
me
in
one
of
the
newspapers
we
got
quite
friendly
and
when
we
reached
durham
where
i
was
getting
out
he
asked
for
my
card
the
reader
can
imagine
his
surprise
when
i
handed
it
to
him
this
little
story
has
been
much
warped
and
magnified
and
has
even
been
made
the
subject
of
a
leading
article
which
takes
me
to
task
for
glorying
in
my
gruesome
calling
and
shocking
respectable
people
by
giving
them
my
cards
another
little
anecdote
which
has
been
greatly
distorted
is
what
i
call
the
toothache
story
it
happened
in
when
crossing
from
ireland
that
there
was
one
of
the
passengers
who
was
terribly
ill
with
mal
de
mer
and
toothache
combined
he
was
rather
a
bother
to
several
travellers
who
were
not
sick
and
who
wished
to
enjoy
the
voyage
and
he
must
have
given
a
lot
of
trouble
to
the
stewards
i
think
that
one
of
the
latter
must
have
told
him
that
i
could
cure
him
for
he
came
and
begged
me
to
tell
him
what
was
the
best
thing
for
his
complaint
i
admitted
that
i
was
in
the
habit
of
giving
drops
that
would
instantaneously
cure
both
the
toothache
and
the
but
assured
him
that
he
would
not
be
willing
to
take
my
remedy
still
he
persisted
so
i
handed
him
a
card
and
as
he
was
a
sensitive
man
it
gave
his
nerves
a
shock
that
was
quite
sufficient
to
relieve
him
of
the
toothache
and
me
of
his
presence
for
the
rest
of
the
voyage
as
the
card
which
i
then
used
has
often
been
mentioned
in
the
newspapers
i
give
a
of
it
the
wording
was
in
black
with
the
fern
in
green
and
the
border
in
gold
i
now
use
a
perfectly
plain
card
as
reproduced
on
page
illustration
a
sad
little
incident
in
connection
with
the
murder
of
warder
webb
by
john
jackson
will
always
remain
in
my
memory
i
had
been
to
strangeways
gaol
once
or
twice
before
on
duty
and
webb
had
always
been
my
personal
attendant
during
my
residence
so
that
we
were
quite
friendly
at
the
execution
previous
to
jackson
that
of
john
alfred
gell
in
may
we
had
two
or
three
long
chats
and
webb
was
most
anxious
that
i
should
go
to
manchester
to
spend
a
or
a
day
with
him
in
the
city
when
he
could
get
leave
of
absence
he
hoped
it
would
be
a
long
time
before
they
should
see
me
there
again
professionally
but
said
that
they
would
always
be
glad
to
see
me
if
i
were
in
manchester
on
other
business
and
could
call
then
turning
to
the
subject
of
executions
he
began
wondering
who
would
be
the
next
that
i
should
have
to
go
there
for
and
who
would
be
the
victim
and
shaking
his
head
sadly
he
said
a
body
never
knows
who
will
be
next
the
poor
fellow
little
thought
that
he
would
be
the
next
victim
and
that
the
very
next
time
i
visited
strangeways
would
be
no
friendly
call
but
a
visit
to
avenge
his
own
death
of
course
my
duties
take
me
about
the
country
a
great
deal
and
i
have
met
a
great
many
interesting
people
in
the
course
of
my
travels
as
a
rule
i
do
not
make
myself
known
unless
i
have
some
good
reason
for
doing
so
because
i
have
no
fancy
for
making
myself
into
a
cheap
show
on
one
occasion
i
travelled
from
coventry
to
warwick
with
the
reporter
of
one
of
the
coventry
papers
he
knew
nothing
of
my
identity
and
does
not
seem
to
have
recognised
me
at
the
execution
but
while
writing
out
his
report
the
connection
between
the
gentleman
in
the
train
and
the
executioner
in
the
gaol
seems
to
have
dawned
upon
him
and
he
wrote
the
following
which
amused
me
greatly
when
it
appeared
in
his
paper
after
writing
this
report
and
describing
the
hangman
features
and
dress
it
dawned
upon
the
writer
for
the
first
time
that
the
description
was
that
of
a
gentleman
with
whom
he
had
travelled
from
coventry
to
warwick
on
the
previous
afternoon
on
reflecting
upon
all
the
circumstances
of
the
journey
he
felt
quite
certain
of
the
fact
and
although
amused
at
the
thought
of
having
travelled
and
conversed
with
an
executioner
without
knowing
it
he
was
a
little
chagrined
that
he
had
not
given
the
conversation
a
professional
turn
which
he
would
have
done
had
he
been
aware
who
his
fellow
traveller
was
the
incident
is
sufficient
to
show
that
persons
travelling
by
rail
occasionally
get
into
singular
company
without
having
the
slightest
knowledge
of
the
fact
in
when
i
had
to
go
to
dorchester
to
hang
henry
william
young
for
the
poole
murder
i
stayed
at
bournemouth
and
took
a
room
in
a
temperance
hotel
during
the
evening
i
got
into
conversation
with
the
landlady
who
was
much
interested
in
the
subject
of
executions
and
who
appeared
to
like
to
discuss
it
she
was
decidedly
down
on
berry
the
hangsman
and
expressed
herself
very
freely
as
to
his
character
and
disposition
amongst
other
pleasant
things
saying
that
he
was
a
man
without
a
soul
and
not
fit
to
have
intercourse
with
respectable
people
of
course
i
smilingly
agreed
with
everything
that
she
had
to
say
and
chuckled
quietly
to
myself
about
a
little
surprise
that
i
had
in
store
for
her
the
surprise
came
off
at
when
she
handed
me
my
bedroom
candle
and
in
return
i
handed
her
my
card
the
good
lady
nearly
fainted
it
is
not
often
that
i
feel
frightened
for
i
am
pretty
well
able
to
take
care
of
myself
but
i
once
had
a
little
adventure
in
the
train
coming
from
galway
to
dublin
that
gave
me
one
or
two
cold
shivers
it
was
at
a
time
when
ireland
was
much
disturbed
by
agrarian
outrages
and
i
knew
that
amongst
some
of
the
lower
classes
there
was
a
feeling
of
hatred
against
myself
on
account
of
my
occupation
of
this
i
had
an
example
when
going
down
galway
and
as
it
led
up
to
and
somewhat
prepared
me
for
the
other
incident
i
may
as
well
mention
it
my
journey
to
galway
was
undertaken
for
the
purpose
of
hanging
four
men
who
were
condemned
to
death
for
moonlighting
it
was
an
exciting
journey
altogether
for
four
men
who
were
in
the
same
compartment
as
myself
from
dublin
to
mullingar
got
into
an
excited
discussion
upon
some
political
subject
and
just
as
we
left
killucan
they
began
to
fight
most
violently
using
their
sticks
and
fists
to
such
an
extent
that
all
their
faces
were
soon
covered
with
blood
as
the
train
drew
into
mullingar
the
fury
cooled
as
quickly
as
it
had
begun
they
all
began
to
apologise
to
each
other
and
wipe
the
blood
from
one
faces
at
mullingar
i
got
out
for
a
drink
to
steady
my
nerves
for
the
fight
at
such
close
quarters
had
somewhat
upset
me
although
i
took
no
part
in
it
on
the
platform
two
villainously
characters
spoke
a
few
words
to
the
men
who
had
got
out
of
my
compartment
and
then
followed
me
into
the
refreshment
room
where
they
seemed
anxious
to
make
my
acquaintance
and
so
forcibly
insisted
that
i
should
have
a
drink
with
them
that
i
had
to
consent
for
fear
of
causing
a
row
they
asked
me
where
i
was
going
said
that
they
were
going
to
galway
and
in
what
seemed
to
me
a
peculiarly
significant
tone
asked
me
if
i
knew
whether
barry
the
hangsman
was
really
in
the
train
or
not
they
followed
me
on
to
the
platform
like
two
shadows
and
got
into
the
same
compartment
of
the
train
all
this
made
me
feel
rather
uncomfortable
for
though
i
was
well
armed
there
is
nothing
in
life
that
i
dread
so
much
as
the
possibility
of
having
to
kill
a
man
in
and
of
being
tried
and
possibly
convicted
for
murder
i
was
therefore
very
pleased
when
two
men
whom
i
knew
belonged
to
the
royal
irish
constabulary
got
into
the
other
half
of
the
carriage
which
was
one
of
those
in
which
there
are
two
compartments
divided
by
a
low
partition
i
do
not
know
whether
my
two
rough
companions
even
noticed
that
there
was
anyone
in
the
other
half
of
the
carriage
to
which
their
backs
were
turned
their
conduct
indeed
seemed
to
show
that
they
thought
we
were
alone
but
i
could
see
that
the
men
were
regarding
them
with
interest
and
taking
note
of
every
word
they
said
all
the
way
from
mullingar
to
athenry
the
two
fellows
plied
me
with
questions
and
tried
by
all
means
in
their
power
to
draw
me
into
discussion
and
the
expression
of
opinion
i
answered
them
as
briefly
as
i
could
without
being
uncivil
but
took
care
that
they
should
not
gain
much
solid
information
from
my
answers
at
athenry
they
shuffled
into
the
far
corner
of
the
compartment
and
in
stage
whispers
which
they
evidently
thought
i
could
not
hear
argued
as
to
whether
i
was
barry
or
not
one
of
them
got
quite
excited
pointed
out
that
i
was
an
englishman
that
i
came
from
the
north
of
england
that
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
train
that
looked
like
an
executioner
that
my
tale
about
being
a
was
all
a
loie
and
finally
that
i
had
a
scar
on
my
cheek
which
proved
it
intoirely
begorra
the
other
fellow
said
that
shure
the
gintleman
in
the
corner
was
a
gintleman
and
not
a
murtherin
blagyard
of
a
hangman
which
opinion
at
last
seemed
to
be
shared
by
both
as
we
steamed
into
galway
i
used
my
handkerchief
and
then
rested
my
hand
on
the
with
the
handkerchief
hanging
out
this
was
the
signal
arranged
with
my
police
escort
who
were
on
the
platform
and
who
managed
to
be
just
opposite
the
door
when
the
train
stopped
as
i
marched
off
amongst
those
strapping
fellows
i
looked
round
to
see
my
two
travelling
companions
gesticulating
wildly
and
abusing
each
other
for
having
been
deceived
and
for
having
treated
the
very
blagyard
we
went
to
meet
i
never
knew
whether
they
had
intended
me
any
harm
but
the
constabulary
men
told
me
that
they
were
two
of
the
roughest
characters
in
galway
the
four
men
who
were
condemned
to
death
were
reprieved
one
after
the
other
as
the
days
fixed
for
their
executions
drew
near
so
that
i
was
not
required
to
carry
out
my
painful
duty
after
all
but
i
was
kept
waiting
more
than
a
week
in
galway
gaol
with
nothing
more
lively
to
do
than
to
read
the
newspapers
and
to
walk
about
in
the
dreary
prison
yard
because
the
governor
did
not
consider
that
it
would
be
safe
for
me
to
venture
outside
i
was
heartily
glad
when
the
last
reprieve
arrived
and
i
was
free
to
return
home
to
avoid
observation
as
much
as
possible
i
took
the
midnight
train
and
as
there
were
very
few
passengers
i
secured
a
compartment
to
myself
and
made
all
snug
for
a
sleep
i
was
not
disturbed
until
we
reached
mullingar
when
i
noticed
a
man
who
looked
into
my
compartment
then
walked
the
whole
length
of
the
train
and
finally
came
into
my
compartment
although
there
were
others
in
the
train
quite
empty
he
at
once
began
to
talk
to
me
in
a
friendly
sort
of
style
with
a
strong
american
twang
but
i
did
not
like
his
looks
at
all
so
pretended
to
want
to
go
to
sleep
as
i
sized
him
up
from
my
lids
i
set
him
down
as
a
heavy
swell
yankee
he
wore
a
big
slouch
hat
and
cape
coat
carried
an
elaborately
handbag
and
his
coat
pocket
showed
the
unmistakable
outline
of
a
revolver
he
plied
me
with
all
sorts
of
questions
on
irish
politics
asked
me
where
i
lived
what
was
my
business
where
i
was
going
to
stay
in
dublin
and
a
host
of
other
questions
which
i
evaded
as
far
as
i
decently
could
i
did
tell
him
amongst
other
things
that
my
name
was
aykroyd
and
that
i
lived
in
the
north
of
england
but
not
very
much
beyond
this
after
a
while
he
pulled
out
his
revolver
and
commenced
examining
it
in
a
careless
sort
of
fashion
as
i
did
not
like
this
turn
of
affairs
i
pulled
out
my
own
weapon
which
was
built
for
business
and
twice
the
size
of
the
one
carried
by
the
stranger
and
made
a
pretence
of
looking
it
over
very
carefully
the
stranger
asked
me
to
let
him
examine
my
gun
but
i
told
him
that
it
was
a
weapon
that
i
did
not
like
to
hand
about
for
fear
of
accidents
and
after
a
final
look
at
the
charges
i
put
it
back
into
my
coat
pocket
in
such
a
position
that
it
covered
the
stranger
and
kept
my
finger
on
the
trigger
until
we
reached
dublin
the
american
tried
to
keep
up
a
conversation
all
the
way
but
i
was
not
very
encouraging
and
i
thought
that
by
the
time
we
reached
dublin
he
would
be
heartily
sick
of
my
company
but
when
i
got
out
of
the
station
and
was
driving
off
to
my
hotel
i
was
surprised
to
find
that
he
jumped
on
to
the
same
car
and
said
he
would
go
to
the
same
hotel
as
i
did
after
having
a
wash
i
came
down
into
the
breakfast
room
and
heard
the
american
asking
the
waitress
if
she
knew
berry
to
which
she
replied
that
she
did
and
then
if
berry
was
there
that
morning
to
which
she
replied
that
she
had
not
seen
him
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
had
not
and
i
slipped
along
the
passage
to
tell
her
as
she
went
to
the
kitchen
that
my
name
was
aykroyd
i
found
in
the
coffee
room
that
there
was
a
letter
addressed
to
me
on
the
the
stranger
was
examining
this
and
asked
me
if
i
knew
the
hangman
by
sight
when
it
was
nearly
time
to
catch
my
boat
the
stranger
still
stuck
to
me
and
at
the
last
moment
he
suggested
that
we
should
have
a
drink
together
we
went
to
mooney
where
i
was
known
to
the
to
whom
i
tipped
a
vigorous
wink
as
we
went
in
which
showed
him
there
was
something
in
the
wind
after
ordering
our
drinks
the
american
asked
him
if
he
knew
berry
the
hangman
to
which
he
truthfully
replied
that
he
did
the
american
then
asked
if
he
knew
whether
berry
had
come
from
galway
by
the
night
mail
adding
he
was
expected
to
travel
by
that
train
but
aykroyd
and
myself
came
by
it
and
we
saw
nobody
like
him
though
i
carefully
looked
along
the
whole
train
the
of
course
knew
nothing
so
we
drank
up
and
i
went
out
to
my
car
the
american
shaking
hands
with
me
and
wishing
me
a
pleasant
voyage
i
had
run
it
rather
close
and
quick
driving
only
just
brought
us
to
the
quay
in
time
for
me
to
get
aboard
as
the
ship
swung
out
from
the
a
car
driven
at
speed
came
dashing
along
and
the
passenger
whom
i
recognised
as
my
american
gesticulated
wildly
as
if
he
wanted
the
vessel
to
stop
but
we
swung
out
with
steam
and
tide
and
he
drove
some
distance
along
the
wildly
but
vainly
waving
his
hands
the
next
time
i
was
at
mooney
i
heard
some
further
particulars
the
stranger
had
gone
back
for
another
drink
and
after
chatting
for
a
few
minutes
the
told
him
that
his
friend
aykroyd
was
the
very
berry
for
whom
he
had
been
enquiring
on
hearing
that
he
rapped
out
oaths
rushed
for
a
car
and
drove
off
in
mad
haste
i
have
never
seen
him
since
nor
has
the
and
i
never
knew
what
were
the
motives
for
his
peculiar
conduct
appendix
the
trouble
with
answers
limited
early
last
year
i
felt
compelled
to
bring
an
action
for
libel
against
the
answers
newspaper
as
the
case
was
fully
reported
at
the
time
i
think
that
a
report
condensed
from
the
columns
of
bradford
of
march
may
be
more
satisfactory
than
my
own
statement
of
the
case
i
therefore
give
it
in
the
form
of
an
appendix
rather
than
in
the
chapter
the
press
and
the
public
to
which
it
belongs
in
this
action
waddy
and
waugh
instructed
by
wright
appeared
for
the
plaintiff
james
berry
the
public
executioner
of
bilton
place
bradford
and
cyril
dodd
appeared
for
the
defendants
the
answers
newspaper
company
limited
the
plaintiff
claimed
for
libel
which
was
printed
and
published
in
the
periodical
called
answers
the
defendants
admitted
the
printing
and
publication
of
the
libel
and
by
way
of
mitigation
of
damages
they
withdrew
all
moral
imputations
against
berry
character
and
paid
a
sum
of
into
court
and
apologised
for
the
words
used
waddy
said
in
behalf
of
the
plaintiff
and
he
thought
the
observation
would
commend
itself
to
their
judgment
that
no
man
in
the
kingdom
whatever
he
might
be
and
whatever
calling
he
might
follow
as
long
as
he
followed
the
duties
of
his
calling
in
honesty
and
integrity
ought
to
be
deliberately
insulted
and
flouted
for
any
reason
whatever
and
he
believed
that
when
they
heard
what
kinds
of
falsehoods
were
printed
concerning
berry
they
would
agree
with
him
that
berry
although
he
was
the
common
executioner
being
a
sober
and
respectable
man
was
entitled
at
their
hands
to
be
protected
from
wanton
insult
he
would
tell
them
what
the
facts
were
it
appeared
that
some
time
in
september
or
october
of
a
man
named
white
came
to
him
representing
himself
to
be
a
correspondent
of
an
american
newspaper
and
told
berry
that
he
was
anxious
to
hear
his
views
upon
the
very
interesting
subject
of
executions
by
means
of
electricity
and
that
his
opinion
in
view
of
his
experience
at
executions
was
of
very
great
importance
he
offered
berry
a
fee
of
if
he
would
give
him
the
interview
which
he
desired
and
that
fee
was
paid
and
berry
did
discuss
the
question
with
him
he
did
that
on
the
promise
both
by
word
of
mouth
and
in
writing
that
whatever
he
said
should
not
be
published
in
this
country
waddy
then
read
the
article
which
had
appeared
in
answers
from
which
i
need
only
give
extracts
he
is
a
powerful
man
of
about
medium
stature
and
his
countenance
is
not
an
unpleasant
one
at
a
first
glance
though
upon
closer
study
one
discovers
that
the
face
reveals
the
lack
of
several
moral
elements
in
the
man
composition
which
seems
to
indicate
that
the
creator
designed
him
especially
for
the
ends
he
serves
a
critical
observer
would
probably
say
that
his
eyes
are
too
close
together
and
that
their
brilliancy
is
that
of
the
codfish
rather
than
the
eagle
while
though
the
mouth
and
chin
indicate
determination
the
forehead
gives
the
impression
of
lack
of
balance
a
phrenologist
would
perhaps
find
that
the
cranial
bumps
that
indicate
sense
and
shame
pity
and
sympathy
are
not
particularly
well
developed
upon
the
head
of
berry
have
you
ever
been
threatened
by
the
friends
of
criminals
whom
you
have
hanged
often
replied
berry
but
i
do
pay
no
attention
to
them
i
a
doin
o
my
duty
and
i
protected
by
th
government
it
was
said
that
if
maybrick
had
not
been
reprieved
a
mob
would
have
been
formed
in
liverpool
to
prevent
your
hanging
her
they
never
have
seen
me
said
berry
i
been
in
jail
and
her
before
th
mob
knew
i
was
about
and
i
been
on
th
train
and
on
my
way
back
before
they
knew
she
was
dead
why
when
i
poole
in
dublin
who
murdered
informer
kenny
who
murdered
th
other
informer
carey
having
been
at
newgate
th
day
before
there
was
a
great
mob
in
dublin
to
prevent
my
getting
into
th
prison
and
nobody
outside
knew
poole
was
until
i
was
on
th
boat
a
steaming
away
for
holyhead
how
do
you
manage
that
i
asked
again
i
tell
you
said
berry
in
a
burst
of
confidence
i
shaves
off
my
whiskers
and
i
puts
on
women
clothes
that
th
way
i
got
into
dublin
jail
with
my
ropes
and
straps
under
my
clothes
and
that
th
way
i
done
many
a
job
berry
never
did
such
a
thing
in
his
life
as
put
on
women
clothes
he
never
had
occasion
to
put
them
on
and
there
was
not
the
slightest
shadow
of
foundation
for
the
statement
the
people
mentioned
in
the
article
as
having
been
hanged
by
berry
were
not
hanged
by
him
at
all
this
libel
was
printed
upon
november
and
an
action
was
commenced
at
once
the
defendants
now
stated
in
mitigation
of
damages
that
they
denied
that
the
words
bore
the
construction
which
the
plaintiff
had
put
upon
them
withdrew
all
imputations
and
admitted
that
any
such
were
unfounded
and
apologised
for
the
matter
complained
of
but
the
apology
and
the
withdrawal
appeared
upon
the
pleadings
only
from
that
day
to
this
with
of
their
papers
going
out
every
week
there
had
net
been
one
single
word
in
the
paper
apologising
for
their
action
it
was
open
to
them
with
a
view
to
mitigation
of
damages
to
have
taken
this
course
but
they
had
done
nothing
but
put
their
apology
upon
the
record
and
paid
into
court
the
majestic
sum
of
as
in
their
opinion
sufficient
to
atone
for
the
wrong
berry
was
then
put
into
the
box
and
supported
statements
waddy
then
spoke
upon
the
whole
case
for
the
defendants
dodd
said
that
the
owners
of
the
newspaper
which
he
represented
were
as
anxious
as
anybody
could
be
that
reasonable
justice
should
be
done
of
course
berry
did
not
suggest
that
there
was
any
actual
money
loss
then
another
feature
of
such
a
case
was
the
question
of
whether
the
paper
was
one
of
that
class
which
feeds
on
personal
attacks
he
submitted
that
the
general
character
of
the
paper
a
point
to
which
juries
were
apt
to
pay
some
attention
was
good
the
articles
in
question
were
copied
from
an
american
paper
and
the
proprietors
of
answers
were
in
the
position
of
having
been
misled
just
as
the
proprietors
of
the
york
had
been
misled
by
the
large
imagination
of
white
berry
seemed
to
be
very
quick
in
his
methods
for
his
writ
was
served
within
a
very
few
days
of
the
appearance
of
the
article
and
without
any
opportunity
being
given
to
his
clients
to
try
and
make
some
kind
of
apology
to
suit
him
his
clients
had
endeavoured
to
meet
the
case
in
a
perfectly
reasonable
way
they
did
not
for
a
moment
express
any
doubt
that
they
were
dealing
with
an
honest
a
decent
and
an
experienced
man
they
withdrew
all
supposed
imputations
and
had
had
no
intention
of
making
any
and
he
contended
that
the
highest
testimonial
possible
was
one
from
a
person
who
had
said
something
derogatory
to
him
berry
had
suffered
no
monetary
damage
whatever
beyond
the
actual
costs
of
the
action
he
suggested
therefore
that
the
jury
should
give
such
a
verdict
as
would
show
that
the
plaintiff
was
quite
right
in
bringing
the
matter
into
court
but
that
they
were
of
opinion
that
the
defendants
had
done
everything
that
they
could
to
mitigate
the
mischief
and
