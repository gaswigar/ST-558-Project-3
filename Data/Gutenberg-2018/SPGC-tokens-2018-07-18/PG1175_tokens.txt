the

an
imaginary
dialogue
between
simonides
of

poet
and
hieron
of
syracuse
and

the
despot

or
the
tyrant
a
discourse
on
despotic
rule
i
once
upon
a
time
simonides
the
poet
paid
a
visit
to
hiero
the
tyrant
and
when
both
obtained
the
leisure
requisite
simonides
began
this
conversation

came

court
of
the
despotic

introduction
to
the
hieron
of
xenophon
would
you
be
pleased
to
give
me
information
hiero
upon
certain
matters
as
to
which
it
is
likely
you
have
greater
knowledge
than
myself
or
would
you
oblige
me
by
explaining
certain
matters
as
to
which
your
knowledge
naturally
transcends
my
own
and
pray
what
sort
of
things
may
those
be
answered
hiero
of
which
i
can
have
greater
knowledge
than
yourself
who
are
so
wise
a
man
i
know
replied
the
poet
that
you
were
once
a
private
person
and
are
now
a
monarch
it
is
but
likely
therefore
that
having
tested
both
conditions
you
should
know
better
than
myself
wherein
the
life
of
the
despotic
ruler
differs
from
the
life
of
any
ordinary
person
looking
to
the
sum
of
joys
and
sorrows
to
which
flesh
is
heir
or
a
common
citizen
an
ordinary
mortal
a
private
individual
or
having
experienced
both
lots
in
life
both
forms
of
existence
would
it
not
be
simpler
hiero
replied
if
you
on
your
side
who
are
still
a
private
person
would
refresh
my
memory
by
recalling
the
various
circumstances
of
an
ordinary
mortal
life
with
these
before
me
i
should
be
better
able
to
describe
the
points
of
difference
which
exist
between
the
one
life
and
the
other
simonides
is
still
in
the
chrysalis
or
grub
condition
of
private
citizenship
he
has
not
broken
the
shell
as
yet
of
ordinary
manhood
lit
in
that
case
i
think
i
should
best
be
able
to
point
out
the
of
either
thus
it
was
that
simonides
spoke
first
well
then
as
to
private
persons
for
my
part
i
observe
or
seem
to
have
observed
that
we
are
liable
to
various
pains
and
pleasures
in
the
shape
of
sights
sounds
odours
meats
and
drinks
which
are
conveyed
through
certain
avenues
of
sense
to
wit
the
eyes
ears
nostrils
mouth
and
there
are
other
pleasures
those
named
of
aphrodite
of
which
the
channels
are
well
known
while
as
to
degree
of
heat
and
cold
things
hard
and
soft
things
light
and
heavy
the
sense
appealed
to
here
i
venture
to
believe
is
that
of
the
whole
body
whereby
we
discern
these
opposites
and
derive
from
them
now
pain
now
pleasure
but
with
regard
to
things
named
good
and
evil
it
appears
to
me
that
sometimes
the
mind
or
soul
itself
is
the
sole
instrument
by
which
we
register
our
pains
and
pleasures
whilst
at
other
times
such
pains
and
pleasures
are
derived
conjointly
through
both
soul
and
body
there
are
some
pleasures
further
if
i
may
trust
my
own
sensations
which
are
conveyed
in
sleep
though
how
and
by
what
means
and
when
precisely
are
matters
as
to
which
i
am
still
more
conscious
of
my
ignorance
nor
is
it
to
be
wondered
at
perhaps
if
the
perceptions
of
waking
life
in
some
way
strike
more
clearly
on
our
senses
than
do
those
of
sleep
or
if
i
may
trust
my
powers
of
observation
i
would
say
that
common
men
are
capable
of
pains
and
pleasures
conveyed
through
certain
avenues
of
sense
as
sight
through
our
eyes
sounds
through
our
ears
smells
through
our
noses
and
meats
and
drinks
through
our
mouths

then
as
to
good
and
evil
we
are
affected
pleasurably
or
painfully
as
the
case
may
be
sometimes
if
i
am
right
in
my
conclusion
through
the
mind
itself
alone
at
other
times
or
they
are
mental
partly
partly
physical
lit
the
incidents
of
waking
life
present
sensations
of
a
more
vivid
character
to
this
statement
hiero
made
answer
and
i
for
my
part
o
simonides
would
find
it
hard
to
state
outside
the
list
of
things
which
you
have
named
yourself
in
what
respect
the
despot
can
have
other
channels
of
perception
so
that
up
to
this
point
i
do
not
see
that
the
despotic
life
differs
in
any
way
at
all
from
that
of
common
people
being
like
constituted
the
autocratic
person
has
no
other
sources
of
perception
he
has
no
claim
to
a
wider
gamut
of
sensation
and
consequently
thus
far
there
is
not
a
pin
to
choose
between
the
life
of
the
despot
and
that
of
a
private
person
then
simonides
only
in
this
respect
it
surely
differs
in
that
the
pleasures
which
the
tyrant
enjoys
through
all
these
several
avenues
of
sense
are
many
times
more
numerous
and
the
pains
he
suffers
are
far
fewer
to
which
hiero
nay
that
is
not
so
simonides
take
my
word
for
it
the
fact
is
rather
that
the
pleasures
of
the
despot
are
far
fewer
than
those
of
people
in
a
humbler
condition
and
his
pains
not
only
far
more
numerous
but
more
intense
that
sounds
incredible
exclaimed
simonides
if
it
were
really
so
how
do
you
explain
the
passionate
desire
commonly
displayed
to
wield
the
tyrant
sceptre
and
that
too
on
the
part
of
persons
reputed
to
be
the
ablest
of
men
why
should
all
men
envy
the
despotic
monarch
for
the
reason
he
replied
that
they
form
conclusions
on
the
matter
without
experience
of
the
two
conditions
and
i
will
try
to
prove
to
you
the
truth
of
what
i
say
beginning
with
the
faculty
of
vision
which
unless
my
memory
betrays
me
was
your
well
then
when
i
come
to
reason
on
the
matter
first
of
all
i
find
that
as
regards
the
class
of
objects
of
which
these
orbs
of
vision
are
the
channel
the
despot
has
the
disadvantage
every
region
of
the
world
each
country
on
this
fair
earth
presents
objects
worthy
of
contemplation
in
quest
of
which
the
ordinary
citizen
will
visit
as
the
humour
takes
him
now
some
city
for
the
sake
of
spectacles
or
again
the
great
national
assemblies
where
sights
most
fitted
to
entrance
the
gaze
of
multitudes
would
seem
to
be
collected
but
the
despot
has
neither
part
nor
lot
in
these
high
festivals
seeing
it
is
not
safe
for
him
to
go
where
he
will
find
himself
at
the
mercy
of
the
assembled
crowds
nor
are
his
home
affairs
in
such
security
that
he
can
leave
them
to
the
guardianship
of
others
whilst
he
visits
foreign
parts
a
twofold
apprehension
haunts
him
he
will
be
robbed
of
his
throne
and
at
the
same
time

is
never

yes
simonides
that
is
so
far
true
a
small

of
them
no
doubt
will
and
this
scant
moiety
will
be
sold
at
so
high

looks

briefest
interval
ten
times
more
than
he
can
hope
to
win
from
all

and
then
he
will
be
off

get

all

many
times
more
than
he
will
earn
from
all
the
rest
of
mankind
in
a
whole
lifetime
and
depart
to
which
simonides
well
granted
you
have
the
worst
of
it
in
sights
and
sightseeing
yet
you
must
admit
you
are
large
gainers
through
the
sense
of
hearing
you
who
are
never
stinted
of
that
sweetest
of
all
sounds
the
voice
of
praise
since
all
around
you
are
for
ever
praising
everything
you
do
and
everything
you
say
whilst
conversely
to
that
most
harsh
and
grating
of
all
sounds
the
language
of
abuse
your
ears
are
sealed
since
no
one
cares
to
speak
evil
against
a
monarch
to
his
face

then
hiero
and
what
pleasure
do
you
suppose
mere
abstinence
from
evil
words
implies
when
it
is
an
open
secret
that
those
silent

are
cherishing
all
evil
thoughts
against

what
mirth
do
you
imagine
is

are
suspected
of
bestowing
praise
out
of
mere

harbour
every
evil
thought
against
their
autocratic
lord
simonides
made
answer
yes
i
must
indeed
admit
i
do
concede
to
you
that
praise
alone
is
sweetest
which
is
breathed
from
lips
of
free
men
absolutely
free
but
look
you
here
is
a
point
you
will
find
it
hard
to
persuade
another
that
you
despots
within
the
limits
of
those
things
whereby
we
one
and
all
sustain
our
bodies
in
respect
that
is
of
meats
and
drinks
have
not
a
far
wider
range
of
pleasures
yes
simonides
he
answered
and
what
is
more
i
know
the
explanation
of
the
common
verdict
the
majority
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
we
monarchs
eat
and
drink
with
greater
pleasure
than
do
ordinary
people
because
they
have
got
the
notion
they
themselves
would
make
a
better
dinner
off
the
viands
served
at
our
tables
than
their
own
and
doubtless
some
break
in
the
monotony
gives
a
fillip
of
pleasure
and
that
explains
why
folk
in
general
look
forward
with
pleasure
to
high
days
and
holy
days
mankind
at
large
but
not
the
despot
his
table
groaning
from
day
to
day
under
its
weight
of
viands
admits
of
no
state
occasions
so
that
as
far
as
this
particular
pleasure
to
begin
with
goes
the
pleasure
of
anticipation
the
monarch
is
at
disadvantage
compared
with
private
people
and
in
the
next
place
he
continued
i
am
sure
your
own
experience
will
bear
me
out
so
far
the
more
viands
set
before
a
man
at
table
beyond
what
are
sufficient
the
more
quickly
will
satiety
of
eating
overtake
him
so
that
in
actual
duration
of
the
pleasure
he
with
his
many
dishes
has
less
to
boast
of
than
the
moderate

regards
as
an
excrescence
yes
but
good
gracious
surely
broke
in
simonides
during
the
actual
time
before
the
appetite
is
cloyed
the
gastronomic
pleasure
derived
from
the
costlier
bill
of
fare
far
exceeds
that
of
the
cheaper
lit
so
long
as
the
soul
the
appetite
accepts
with
pleasure
the
viands
there
an
interval
at
any
rate
during
which
such
as
my
soul
delights
in
can
still
apply
and
for
so
long
but
as
a
matter
of
plain
logic
hiero
retorted
should
you
not
say
the
greater
the
pleasure
a
man
feels
in
any
business
the
more
enthusiastic
his
devotion
to
it
that
is
quite
true
he
answered
hiero
then
have
you
ever
noticed
that
crowned
heads
display
more
pleasure
in
attacking
the
bill
of
fare
provided
them
than
private
persons
theirs
no
rather
the
reverse
the
poet
answered
if
anything
they
show
a
less
degree
of
gusto
unless
they
are
vastly
libelled
no
not
more
pleasure
but
exceptional
fastidiousness

what
people
say
is
true
agleukesteron

hiero
continued
and
all
these
dishes
which
are
set
before
the
tyrant
or
of
them
perhaps
you
have
observed
are
combinations
of
things
acid

or
unsuited

in
fact
these

can
only
be
regarded
as
the
cravings

a

weakened

luxurious

i
am
quite
sure
that
keen

it
is
true
at
any
rate
observed
simonides
about
those
costly
perfumes
with
which
your
persons
are
anointed
that
your
neighbours
rather
than
yourselves
extract
enjoyment
from
them
just
as
the
unpleasant
odour
of
some
meats
is
not
so
obvious
to
the
eater
as
to
those
who
come
in

with
him
hiero
good
and
on
this
principle
we
say
of
meats
that
he
who
is
provided
with
all
sorts
on
all

brings
no
appetite
to
any
of

he
rather
to
whom

what
i
most
desire

is
no

as
men
might
reckon
it
but
rather
what
it
is
least
of
all
the
privilege
of
a
tyrant
to
obtain
i
say
it
truly
i
the
love
i
bear
dailochus
is
of
this
high
sort
all
that
the
constitution
of
our
souls
and
bodies
possibly
compels
a
man
to
ask
for
at
the
hands
of
beauty
that
my
fantasy
desires
of
him
but
what
my
fantasy
demands

do
most
earnestly

to
obtain

willing
hands

under

of
true
affection
to
clutch

as
far
from
my
desire
as
to
do
myself
some
mortal
mischief
lit
of

achieve
a
met
from
the
chase
cf
hunting
xii
were
he
my
enemy
to
wrest
some
spoil
from
his
unwilling
hands
would
be
an
exquisite
pleasure
to
my
thinking
but
of
all
sweet
favours
the
sweetest
to
my
notion
is
the
offering
of
a
man
beloved
for
instance
how
sweet
the
responsive
glance
of
love
for
love
how
sweet
the
questions
and
the
answers
and
most
sweet
of
all
most
the
battles
and
the
strifes
of
faithful
lovers
but
to
enjoy
one
love
perforce
he
added
resembles
more
an
act
of
robbery
in
my
judgment
than
love
pastime
and
indeed
the
robber
derives
some
satisfaction
from
the
spoils
he
wins
and
from
the
pain
he
causes
to
the
man
he
hates
but
to
seek
pleasure
in
the
pain
of
one
we
love
devoutly
to
kiss
and
to
be
hated
to
touch
and
to
be
loathed
can
one
conceive
a
state
of
things
more
odious
or
more
pitiful
for
it
is
a
certainty
the
ordinary
person
may
accept
at
once
each
service
rendered
by
the
object
of
his
love
as
a
sign
and
token
of
kindliness
inspired
by
affection
since
he
knows
such
ministry
is
free
from
all
compulsion
whilst
to
the
tyrant
the
confidence
that
he
is
loved
is
quite
foreclosed
on
the
contrary
we
know
for
certain
that
service
rendered
through
terror
will
stimulate
as
far
as
possible
the
ministrations
of
affection
and
it
is
a
fact
that
plots
and
conspiracies
against
despotic
rulers
are
oftenest
hatched

by
the
glamour
of
a
despotism
in
no
respect
astonishes
me
since
it
is
the
very
essence
of
the
crowd
if
i
am
not
mistaken
to
rush
wildly
to
conjecture
touching
the
happiness
or
wretchedness
of
people
at
first
sight
now
the
nature
of
a
tyrrany
is
such
it
presents
nay
flaunts
a
show
of
costliest
possessions
unfolded
to
the
general
gaze
which
rivets
the
attention
but
the
real
troubles
in
the
souls
of
monarchs
it
keeps
concealed
in
those
hid
chambers
where
lie
stowed
away
the
happiness
and
the
unhappiness
of
mankind
there
is
some
redundancy
in
the
phraseology
i
repeat
then
i
little
marvel
that
the
multitude
should
be
blinded
in
this
matter
but
that
you
others
also
you
who
are
held
to
see
with
the
mind
eye
more
clearly
than
with
the
eye
of
sense
the
mass
of
circumstances
should
share
its
ignorance
does
indeed
excite
my
wonderment
now
i
know
it
all
too
plainly
from
my
own
experience
simonides
and
i
assure
you
the
tyrant
is
one
who
has
the
smallest
share
of
life
blessings
whilst
of
its
greater
miseries
he
possesses
most
lit
the
majority
of
things
al
the
thousand
details
of
a
thing
for
instance
if
peace
is
held
to
be
a
mighty
blessing
to
mankind
then
of
peace
despotic
monarchs
are
scant
sharers
or
is
war
a
curse
if
so
of
this
particular
pest
your
monarch
shares
the
largest
moiety
for
look
you
the
private
citizen
unless
his
should
chance
to
be
engaged
in
some
common
war
is
free
to
travel
he
chooses
without
fear
of
being
done
to
death
whereas
the
tyrant
can
not
stir
without
setting
his
foot
on
hostile
territory
at
any
rate
nothing
will
persuade
him
but
he
must
go
through
life
armed
and
on
all
occasions
drag
about
with
him
armed
satellites
in
the
next
place
the
private
citizen
even
during
an
expedition
into
hostile
territory
can
comfort
himself
in
the
reflection
that
as
soon
as
he
gets
back
home
he
will
be
safe
from
further
peril
whereas
the
tyrant
knows
precisely
the
reverse
as
soon
as
he
arrives
in
his
own
city
he
will
find
himself
in
the
centre
of
hostility
at
once
or
let
us
suppose
that
an
invading
army
superior
in
force
is
marching
against
a
city
however
much
the
weaker
population
whilst
they
are
still
outside
their
walls
may
feel
the
stress
of
danger
yet
once
within
their
trenches
one
and
all
expect
to
find
themselves
in
absolute
security
but
the
tyrant
is
not
out
of
danger
even
when
he
has
passed
the
portals
of
his
palace
nay
there
of
all
places
most
he
feels
he
must
maintain
the
strictist
watch
again
to
the
private
citizen
there
will
come
eventually
either
through
truce
or
terms
of
peace
respite
from
war
but
for
the
tyrant
the
day
of
peace
will
never
dawn
what
peace
can
he
have
with
those
over
whom
he
exercises
his
despotic
sway
nor
have
the
terms
of
truce
been
yet
devised
on
which
the
despotic
ruler
may
rely
with
confidence
koinon
making
demands
upon
the
energies
of
all
the
citizens

as
opposed

or
which
the

may
accept

and
go
his
way

wars
doubtless
there
are
wars
waged
by
states
and
wars
waged
by
autocratic
monarchs
against
those
whom
they
have
forcibly
enslaved
and
in
respect
of
these
wars
there
is
no
hardship
which
any
member
of
the
states
at
war
can
suffer
but
the
tyrant
will
feel
it
also
that
is
to
say
both
must
alike
be
under
arms
keep
guard
run
risks
and
whatever
the
pains
of
defeat
may
be
they
are
equally
sustained
by
both
up
to
this
point
there
is
no
distinction
the
bitters
are
equal
but
when
we
come
to
estimate
the
sweets
derivable
from
warfare
between
states
the
parallel
ceases
the
tyrant
if
he
shared
the
pains
before
no
longer
shares
the
pleasures
now
what
happens
when
a

has
gained

this
is
not

either
simonides

it
is
with
tyrants
as
with

just
as
the

feels
no

satisfaction
in
asserting
his
superiority
over

annoyance
rather
when

too
the

finds
little
consolation
in
the
fact
that
he
is

richer

the

what
he
feels
is
pain
when
he
reflects

more

it

that
you
will
find

few

paupers
by

with

the

can
not

expenses
of

are
also
the
most
necessary

devoted
to
various
methods
of

to
cut
down
any
of
them
would
be
little
less
than
suicidal

to

these
would

to
be

to
put
it
differently

should
any
one
expend

if
he
were
a

has
it
in

it
would
be

appropriate
to
call

man
a

starveling

through

perpetually
driven
to
iniquitous
spoilation
of

human
beings
through
chronic
need
of
money
wherewith

inevitable

can
distinguish

just

instead
of
admiring
them
they
are
afraid
of
them
the
courageous
lest
they
should
venture
something
for

the

to
recall
to

what
sort
of
meals
you
made
at
those
times
with
what
sort
of
slumber
you
courted
rest
be
assured
there
are
no
pains
you
then
experienced
no
horrors
to
compare
with
those
that
crowd
upon
the
despot
who
sees
or
seems
to
see
fierce
eyes
of
enemies
glare
at
him
not
face
to
face
alone
but
from
every
side
or
in
the
van
of
battle
opposite
the
hostile
lines
he
had
spoken
so
far
when
simonides
took
up
the
thread
of
the
discourse
replying
excellently
put
a
part
i
must
admit
of
what
you
say
since
war
is
terrible
yet
hiero
you
forget
when
we
at
any
rate
are
out
campaigning
we
have
a
custom
we
place
sentinels
at
the
outposts
and
when
the
watch
is
set
we
take
our
suppers
and
turn
in
undauntedly
and
hiero
answered
yes
i
can
well
believe
you
for
the
laws
are
the
true
outposts
who
guard
the
sentinels
keeping
their
fears
alive
both
for
themselves
and
in
behalf
of
you
whereas
the
tyrant
hires
his
guards
for
pay
like
harvest
labourers
now
of
all
functions
all
abilities
none
i
presume
is
more
required
of
a
guard
than
that
of
faithfulness
and
yet
one
faithful
man
is
a
commodity
more
hard
to
find
than
scores
of
workmen
for
any
sort
of
work
you
like
to
name
and
the
more
so
when
the
guards
in
question
are
not
forthcoming
except
for
money
sake
and
when
they
have
it
in
their
power
to
get
far
more
in
far
less
time
by
murdering
the
despot
than
they
can
hope
to
earn
by
lengthened
service
in
protecting
him
or
beyond
the
sentinels
themselves
is
set
the
outpost
of
the
laws
who
watch
the
watch
or
labourers
in
or
but
to
discover
one
single
faithful
man
is
far
more
difficult
than
scores
of
labourers
in
any
field
of
work
you
please
or
are
merely
hirelings
for
filthy
lucre
sake
and
as
to
that
which
roused
your
envy
our
ability
as
you
call
it
to
benefit
our
friends
most
largely
and
beyond
all
else
to
triumph
over
our
foes
here
again
matters
are
not
as
you
suppose
how
for
instance
can
you
hope
to
benefit
your
friends
when
you
may
rest
assured
the
very
friend
whom
you
have
made
most
your
debtor
will
be
the
happiest
to
quit
your
sight
as
fast
as
may
be
since
nobody
believes
that
anything
a
tyrant
gives
him
is
indeed
his
own
until
he
is
well
beyond
the
donor
jurisdiction
so
much
for
friends
and
as
to
enemies
conversely
how
can
you
say
most
power
of
triumphing
over
our
enemies
when
every
tyrant
knows
full
well
they
are
all
his
enemies
every
man
of
them
who
are
despotically
ruled
by
him
and
to
put
the
whole
of
them
to
death
or
to
imprison
them
is
hardly
possible
or
who
will
be
his
subjects
presently
not
so
but
knowing
they
are
his
enemies
he
must
perform
this
dexterous
feat
he
must
keep
them
at
arm
length
and
yet
be
compelled
to
lean
upon
them
lit
he
must
at
one
and
the
same
moment
guard
against
them
and
yet
be
driven
also
to
depend
upon
them
but
be
assured
simonides
that
when
a
tyrant
fears
any
of
his
citizens
he
is
in
a
strait
it
is
ill
work
to
see
them
living
and
ill
work
to
put
them
to
the
death
just
as
might
happen
with
a
horse
a
noble
beast
but
there
is
that
in
him
makes
one
fear
he
will
do
some
mischief
presently
past
curing
his
very
virtue
makes
it
hard
to
kill
the
creature
and
yet
to
turn
him
to
account
alive
is
also
hard
so
careful
must
one
be
he
does
not
choose
the
thick
of
danger
to
work
irreparable
harm
and
this
further
doubtless
holds
of
all
goods
and
chattels
which
are
at
once
a
trouble
and
a
benefit
if
painful
to
their
owners
to
possess
they
are
none
the
less
a
source
of
pain
to
part
with
lit
good
but
fearful
he
makes
one
fear
he
will
some
day
do
some
desperate
mischief
vii
now
when
he
had
heard
these
reasonings
simonides
replied
o
hiero
there
is
a
potent
force
it
would
appear
the
name
of
which
is
honour
so
attractive
that
human
beings
strain
to
grasp
it
and
in
the
effort
they
will
undergo
all
pains
endure
all
perils
it
would
further
seem
that
even
you
you
tyrants
in
spite
of
all
that
sea
of
trouble
which
a
tyranny
involves
rush
headlong
in
pursuit
of
it
you
must
be
honoured
all
the
world
shall
be
your
ministers
they
shall
carry
out
your
every
injunction
with
unhesitating
zeal
you
shall
be
the
cynosure
of
neighbouring
eyes
men
shall
rise
from
their
seats
at
your
approach
they
shall
step
aside
to
yield
you
passage
in
the
streets
all
present
shall
at
all
times
magnify
you
and
shall
pay
homage
to
you
both
with
words
and
deeds
those
i
take
it
are
ever
the
kind
of
things
which
subjects
do
to
please
the
monarch
and
thus
they
treat
each
hero
of
the
moment
whom
they
strive
to
honour
lit
that
human
beings
will
abide
all
risks
and
undergo
all
pains
to
clutch

yes
hiero
and
herein
precisely
lies
the
difference
between
a
man
and
other
animals
in
this
outstretching
after
honour
since
it
would
seem
all
living
creatures
alike
take
pleasure
in
meats
and
drinks
in
sleep
and
sexual
joys
only
the
love
of
honour
is
implanted
neither
in
unreasoning
brutes
nor
universally
in
man
but
they
in
whose
hearts
the
passion
for
honour
and
fair
fame
has
fallen
like
a
seed
these
unmistakably
are
separated
most
widely
from
the
brutes
these
may
claim
to
be
called
men
not
human
beings
merely
so
that
in
my
poor
judgment
it
is
but
reasonable
you
should
submit
to
bear
the
pains
and
penalties
of
royalty
since
you
are
honoured
far
beyond
all
other
mortal
men
and
indeed
no
pleasure
known
to
man
would
seem
to
be
nearer
that
of
gods
than
the
delight
which
centres
in
proud
attributes
or
in
this
strong
aspiration
after
honour
holden
aptly
cf
spectator
no
the
love
of
praise
is
a
passion
deeply
fixed
in
the
mind
of
every
extraordinary
person
and
those
who
are
most
affected
with
it
seem
most
to
partake
of
that
particle
of
the
divinity
which
distinguishes
mankind
from
the
inferior
creation

or

to
these
arguments
hiero
replied
nay
but
simonides
the
honours
and
proud
attributes
bestowed
on
tyrants
have
much
in
common
with
their
as
i
described
them
like
honours
like
loves
the
pair
are
of
a
piece
for
just
as
the
ministrations
won
from
loveless
hearts
are
felt
to
be
devoid
of
grace
and
embraces
forcibly
procured
are
sweet
no
longer
so
the
obsequious
cringings
of
alarm
are
hardly
honours
since
how
shall
we
assert
that
people
who
are
forced
to
rise
from
their
seats
do
really
rise
to
honour
those
whom
they
regard
as
malefactors
or
that
these
others
who
step
aside
to
let
their
betters
pass
them
in
the
street
desire
thus
to
show
respect
to
miscreants
and
as
to
gifts
it
is
notorious
people
commonly
bestow
them
largely
upon
those
they
hate
and
that
too
when
their
fears
are
gravest
hoping
to
avert
impending
evil
nay
these
are
nothing
more
nor
less
than
acts
of
slavery
and
they
may
fairly
be
set
down
as
such
or
the
compliance
of
cold
lips
where
love
is
not
reciprocated
is
or
to
rank
injustice
but
honours
have
a
very
different
origin
as
different
to
my
mind
as
are
the
sentiments
to
which
they
give
expression
see
how
for
instance
men
of
common
mould
will
single
out
a
man
who
is
a
man
they
feel
and
competent
to
be
their
benefactor
one
from
whom
they
hope
to
reap
rich
blessings
his
name
lives
upon
their
lips
in
praise
as
they
gaze
at
him
each
one
among
them
sees
in
him
a
private
treasure
spontaneously
they
yield
him
passage
in
the
streets
they
rise
from
their
seats
to
do
him
honour
out
of
love
not
fear
they
crown
him
for
his
public
virtue
sake
and
benefactions
they
shower
gifts
upon
him
of
their
own
free
choice
these
same
are
they
who
if
my
definition
holds
may
well
be
said
to
render
honour
to
their
hero
by
such
service
whilst
he
that
is
held
worthy
of
these
services
is
truly
honoured
and
for
my
part
i
can
but
offer
my
congratulations
to
him
god
bless
him
say
i
perceiving
that
so
far
from
being
the
butt
of
foul
conspiracy
he
is
an
object
of
anxiety
to
all
lest
evil
should
betide
him
and
so
he
pursues
the
even
tenour
of
his
days
in
happiness
exempt
from
fears
and
jealousy
and
risk
but
the
current
of
the
tyrant
life
runs
differently
day
and
night
i
do
assure
you
simonides
he
lives
like
one
condemned
by
the
general
verdict
of
mankind
to
die
for
his
iniquity
lit
honours
would
seem
to
be
the
outcome
and
expression
of
conditions
utterly
remote
from
these
in
fact
their
very
opposites
cf
napoleon
accost
of
goethe
vous

and
as
goethe
left
the

napoleon
repeated
to

which

them
and
him
if
with
cobet
koine
in
public
crown
him
for
his
virtue
sake
a
benefactor
or
without
reproach
now
when
simonides
had
listened
to
these
reasonings
to
the
end
he
answered
how
is
it
hiero
if
to
play
the
tyrant
is
a
thing
so
villainous
and
that
is
your
final
judgment
how
comes
it
you
are
not
quit
of
so
monstrous
an
evil
neither
you
nor
for
that
matter
any
monarch
else
i
ever
heard
of
having
once
possessed
the
power
did
ever
of
his
own
free
will
divest
himself
of

how
is
that
hiero
cf
econ
xi
or
if
to
monarchise
and
play
the
despot
for
one
simple
reason
the
tyrant
answered
and
herein
lies
the
supreme
misery
of
despotic
power
it
is
not
possible
even
to
be
quit
of
it
how
could
the
life
of
any
single
tyrant
suffice
to
square
the
account
how
should
he
pay
in
full
to
the
last
farthing
all
the
moneys
of
all
whom
he
has
robbed
with
what
chains
laid
upon
him
make
requital
to
all
those
he
has
thrust
into

ah
no
simonides
he
added
if
to
hang
one
self
outright
be
ever
gainful
to
pour

soul
then
take
my
word
for
it
that
is
the
tyrant
remedy
there
none
better
suited
to
his
case
since
he
alone
of
all
men
is
in
this
dilemma
that
neither
to
keep
nor
lay
aside
his
troubles
profits
him
or
nought
more
profitable
to
meet
the
case

plays

viii
here
simonides
took
up
the
thread
of
the
discourse
as
follows
that
for
the
moment
hiero
you
should
be
out
of
heart
regarding
tyranny
i
do
not
wonder
since
you
have
a
strong
desire
to
be
loved
by
human
beings
and
you
are
persuaded
that
it
is
your
office
which
balks
the
realisation
of
your
dream
al
took
up
the
speaker
thus
in
reference
to
despotic
rule
now
however
i
am
no
less
certain
i
can
prove
to
you
that
government
implies
no
obstacle
to
being
loved
but
rather
holds
the
advantage
over
private
life
so
far
and
whilst
investigating
if
this
be
really
so
let
us
not
embarrass
the
inquiry
by
asking
whether
in
proportion
to
his
greater
power
the
ruler
is
able
to
do
kindness
on
a
grander
scale
but
put
it
thus
two
human
beings
the
one
in
humble
circumstances
the
other
a
despotic
ruler
perform
a
common
act
which
of
these
twain
will
under
like
conditions
win
the
larger
thanks
i
will
begin
with
the
most
trifling
examples
and

friendly

of

be
impressed

sentinels
posted
wherever
there
is
need
of
watch

we
have
to
chastise
we
must
put
a
stop
to
those
who
would
wax
insolent
and
when
the
season
for
swift
action
comes
and
it
is
imperative
to
expedite
a
force
by
land
or
sea
at
such
a
crisis
it
will
not
do
for
us
to
entrust
the
affair
to
or
curb
the
in
sap
and
blood
further
than
that
the
man
who
is
a
tyrant
must
have
mercenaries
and
of
all
the
burdens
which
the
citizens
are
called
upon
to
bear
there
is
none
more
onerous
than
this
since
nothing
will
induce
them
to
believe
these
people
are
supported
by
the
tyrant
to
add
to
his
and
their
prestige
but
rather
for
the

of
his

ix
to
these
arguments
simonides
in

made
answer
nay
hiero
i
am
far
from
stating
that
you
have
not
all
these
divers
matters
to
attend
to
they
are
serious
duties
i
admit
but
still
what
strikes
me
is
if
half
these
grave
responsibilities
do
lend
themselves
undoubtedly
to
hatred
the
remaining
half
are
altogether
gratifying
thus
to
teach
others
arts
of
highest
virtue
and
to
praise
and
honour
each
most
fair
performance
of
the
same
that
is
a
type
of
duty
not
to
be
discharged
save
graciously
whilst
on
the
other
hand
to
scold
at
people
guilty
of
remissness
to
drive
and
fine
and
chasten
these
are
proceedings
doubtless
which
go

what
i
would
say
then
to
the
is
wherever
force
is
needed
the
duty
of
inflicting
chastisement
should
be
assigned
to
others
but
the
distribution
of
rewards
and
prizes
must
be
kept
in
his
own
hands
cf
cyrop

ib
i

i
common
experience
attests
the
excellence
of
such
a
system
thus
when
we
wish
to
set
on
foot
a
competition
between
choruses
it
is
the
function
of
the
archon
to
offer
prizes
whilst
to
the
choregoi
is
assigned
the
duty
of
assembling
the
members
of
the
band
and
to
others
that
of
teaching
and
applying
force
to
those
who
come
behindhand
in
their
duties
there
then
you
have
the
principle
at
once
the
gracious
and
agreeable
devolves
on
him
who
rules

the
repellent
counterpart
on

is
there
to
prevent

of

for

no

the
first

duty
laid

in
addition
to
these

such
a
body
might
with
reason
be
expected
to
create
a
sense

courage

security
by
which
the

labourers

these
