introduction
walter
scott
the
ninth
of
a
family
of
twelve
children
was
born
at
edinburgh
in
august
his
first
consciousness
of
existence
dated
from
the
time
when
he
was
sent
a
lame
delicate
child
to
sandyknowe
the
residence
of
his
paternal
grandfather
here
he
was
often
carried
out
and
laid
down
beside
the
old
shepherd
among
the
crags
or
rocks
round
which
he
fed
his
sheep
if
scott
genius
was
late
in
flowering
who
can
say
that
the
budding
did
not
begin
in
that
early
close
companionship
with
the
highland
country
which
he
was
to
reproduce
so
vividly
in
his
verse
and
fiction
with
strength
increased
by
life
although
still
slightly
lame
we
find
him
later
a
sturdy
active
not
boy
at
school
at
edinburgh
and
kelso
and
at
fifteen
beginning
in
his
father
office
the
legal
studies
which
he
continued
at
the
university
referring
to
the
time
after
leaving
the
high
school
when
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
tasso
jerusalem
delivered
percy
reliques
and
the
best
works
of
english
fiction
scott
says
to
this
period
i
can
trace
distinctly
the
awakening
of
that
delightful
feeling
for
the
beauties
of
natural
objects
which
has
never
deserted
me
from
this
time
the
love
of
natural
beauty
more
especially
when
combined
with
ancient
ruins
or
remains
of
our
fathers
piety
or
splendor
became
within
me
an
insatiable
passion
which
if
circumstances
had
permitted
i
would
willingly
have
gratified
by
traveling
half
over
the
globe
his
gigantic
memory
had
always
appropriated
most
eagerly
the
heroic
and
romantic
elements
of
verse
tale
and
history
from
the
days
when
a
child
he
read
pope
translation
of
homer
aloud
to
his
mother
to
the
time
when
he
hunted
ballads
and
chased
traditions
with
the
keen
zest
of
a
scholar
and
an
antiquary
the
first
notable
outcome
of
these
researches
was
his
minstrelsy
of
the
scottish
border
published
in
to
this
collection
of
ancient
border
ballads
which
he
had
spent
years
in
collecting
were
added
some
spirited
new
ones
which
he
had
deftly
shaped
to
the
old
models
this
form
of
poetic
expression
was
especially
suited
to
the
genius
of
scott
and
the
class
of
subjects
to
which
it
was
usually
adapted
had
long
been
the
object
of
his
enthusiastic
study
the
amplification
then
of
the
ballad
to
the
proportions
of
the
more
pretentious
metrical
romance
came
by
a
natural
process
of
crystallization
of
the
elements
of
a
rare
power
profound
research
and
inspiring
themes
the
first
of
the
more
ambitious
efforts
of
scott
was
the
lay
of
the
last
minstrel
which
was
published
in
this
became
immediately
and
generally
popular
and
paved
the
way
for
the
favorable
reception
of
later
productions
in
marmion
the
greatest
poetical
work
of
scott
appeared
this
was
so
enthusiastically
received
that
a
certain
friend
urged
him
to
be
satisfied
with
such
unexampled
success
and
refrain
from
publishing
anything
more
lest
he
impair
his
prestige
to
this
he
replied
if
i
fail
it
is
a
sign
that
i
ought
never
to
have
succeeded
and
i
will
write
prose
for
life
you
shall
see
no
change
in
my
temper
nor
will
i
eat
a
single
meal
the
worse
but
if
i
succeed
with
the
bonnie
blue
bonnet
the
dirk
and
the
feather
and
a
in
this
confident
buoyant
spirit
he
made
another
venture
the
lady
of
the
lake
published
in
and
its
extraordinary
success
justified
his
expectations
how
sincere
and
widespread
was
the
enthusiastic
appreciation
of
this
poem
may
be
judged
from
the
following
instance
mentioned
in
lockhart
life
of
scott
in
the
course
of
the
day
when
lady
of
the
lake
first
reached
sir
adam
fergusson
he
was
posted
with
his
company
on
a
point
of
ground
exposed
to
the
artillery
somewhere
no
doubt
on
the
lines
of
torres
vedras
the
men
were
ordered
to
lie
prostrate
on
the
ground
while
they
kept
that
attitude
the
captain
kneeling
at
the
head
read
aloud
the
description
of
the
battle
in
canto
and
the
listening
soldiers
only
interrupted
him
by
a
joyous
huzza
when
the
french
shot
struck
the
bank
close
above
them
we
are
not
surprised
at
the
soldierly
tribute
to
the
power
of
a
poet
through
whose
head
a
regiment
of
horse
had
been
exercising
since
he
was
five
years
old
whose
sympathies
had
always
been
in
touch
with
heroic
achievement
and
chivalrous
enterprise
and
whose
poems
rang
with
the
quick
metrical
tramp
of
his
own
but
this
was
only
a
fractional
though
precious
part
of
the
applause
that
greeted
him
the
whole
country
rang
with
the
praises
of
the
poet
crowds
set
off
to
view
the
scenery
of
loch
katrine
till
then
comparatively
unknown
and
as
the
book
came
out
just
before
the
season
for
excursions
every
house
and
inn
in
that
neighborhood
was
crammed
with
a
constant
succession
of
visitors
scott
in
speaking
of
this
poem
says
the
ancient
manners
the
habits
and
customs
of
the
aboriginal
race
by
whom
the
highlands
of
scotland
were
inhabited
had
always
appeared
to
me
peculiarly
adapted
to
poetry
the
change
in
their
manners
too
had
taken
place
almost
within
my
own
time
or
at
least
i
had
learned
many
particulars
concerning
the
ancient
state
of
the
highlands
from
the
old
men
of
the
last
generation
i
had
also
read
a
great
deal
seen
much
and
heard
more
of
the
romantic
country
where
i
was
in
the
habit
of
spending
every
autumn
and
the
scenery
of
loch
katrine
was
connected
with
the
recollection
of
many
a
dear
friend
and
merry
expedition
of
former
days
this
poem
the
action
of
which
lay
among
scenes
so
beautiful
and
so
deeply
imprinted
upon
my
recollections
was
a
labor
of
love
and
it
was
no
less
so
to
recall
the
manners
and
incidents
introduced
the
frequent
custom
of
james
and
particularly
of
james
of
walking
through
the
kingdom
in
disguise
afforded
me
the
hint
of
an
incident
which
never
fails
to
be
interesting
if
managed
with
the
slightest
address
or
dexterity
the
mark
of
scott
popularity
as
a
poet
was
reached
with
the
lady
of
the
lake
in
he
published
rokeby
and
in
the
lord
of
the
isles
in
the
latter
year
waverley
appeared
anonymously
and
with
this
prose
romance
began
scott
career
as
a
novelist
which
extended
through
fourteen
years
in
this
period
of
time
he
wrote
novels
besides
some
other
works
of
minor
importance
the
land
of
the
lakes
and
the
mountains
and
of
the
brave
men
as
the
old
scots
called
their
country
included
the
two
great
divisions
the
highlands
and
the
borders
which
were
so
much
wilder
and
more
barbarous
than
the
others
that
they
might
be
said
to
be
altogether
without
law
although
nominally
subject
to
the
king
of
scotland
yet
they
were
so
untamable
that
the
enforcement
of
justice
was
almost
as
difficult
as
the
subjugation
of
a
foreign
people
the
highlands
rocky
and
mountainous
parts
of
the
country
comprised
a
large
share
of
the
north
of
scotland
it
was
into
these
pathless
wilds
that
the
romans
drove
the
ancient
britons
and
it
was
from
these
retreats
that
the
fugitives
afterward
sallied
forth
to
harass
their
conquerors
the
language
of
the
highlands
the
gaelic
was
totally
different
from
that
of
the
lowlands
which
resembled
english
the
dress
of
the
mountaineers
also
differed
from
that
of
the
lowlanders
they
wore
a
plaid
or
mantle
of
frieze
or
of
a
striped
stuff
called
tartan
one
end
of
which
being
wrapped
around
the
waist
formed
a
short
petticoat
which
descended
to
the
knee
while
the
rest
they
folded
around
them
like
a
sort
of
cloak
their
feet
were
covered
with
buskins
made
of
rawhide
and
the
usual
head
covering
was
a
cap
called
a
bonnet
they
went
always
armed
their
weapons
were
bows
and
arrows
large
swords
poleaxes
and
daggers
for
close
fight
for
defense
they
had
a
round
wooden
shield
or
target
stuck
full
of
nails
and
their
great
men
had
shirts
of
mail
composed
of
links
of
iron
the
common
men
sometimes
wore
a
jacket
of
leather
having
plates
of
metal
stitched
into
it
but
usually
had
no
armor
the
highlanders
were
divided
into
clans
or
tribes
all
members
of
a
clan
supposed
themselves
to
be
descended
from
the
same
common
ancestor
whose
name
distinguished
them
from
other
clans
thus
one
tribe
was
called
macdonald
which
signifies
the
sons
of
donald
another
macgregor
the
sons
of
gregor
macneil
the
sons
of
neil
and
so
on
they
yielded
unquestioning
obedience
to
their
chief
even
when
their
submission
to
his
orders
implied
disloyalty
to
the
king
each
tribe
had
its
own
special
territory
any
invasion
of
which
was
punished
as
severely
as
though
the
foe
had
been
of
another
nationality
macaulay
says
of
the
sentiment
that
actuated
them
their
intense
attachment
to
their
own
tribe
and
to
their
own
patriarch
though
politically
an
evil
partook
of
the
nature
of
virtue
the
sentiment
was
misdirected
and
but
still
it
was
heroic
there
must
be
some
elevation
of
soul
in
a
man
who
loves
the
society
of
which
he
is
a
member
and
the
leader
whom
he
follows
with
a
love
stronger
than
the
love
of
life
it
was
true
that
the
highlander
had
few
scruples
about
shedding
the
blood
of
an
enemy
but
it
was
not
less
true
that
he
had
high
notions
of
the
duty
of
observing
faith
to
allies
and
hospitality
to
guests
the
highlanders
were
continually
at
war
with
the
lowlanders
they
did
not
regard
their
plundering
raids
upon
the
richer
grounds
of
the
lowlands
as
robbery
but
as
rightful
recovery
of
possessions
which
had
been
wrongfully
wrested
from
their
ancestors
the
lowlanders
equal
in
courage
and
superior
in
discipline
could
not
be
easily
overcome
and
thus
there
was
almost
constant
war
or
discord
between
them
some
of
the
more
powerful
highland
chiefs
set
themselves
up
as
independent
sovereigns
and
even
made
alliances
with
the
english
in
their
own
name
macaulay
says
that
national
enmities
have
always
been
fiercest
among
borderers
and
the
enmity
between
the
highland
borderer
and
the
lowland
borderer
along
the
whole
frontier
was
the
growth
of
ages
and
was
kept
fresh
by
constant
injuries
the
borderers
were
also
divided
into
clans
and
their
devotion
to
their
chieftain
was
complete
from
their
proximity
to
england
and
their
frequent
incursions
into
its
territory
they
added
to
the
perplexities
of
scottish
rule
which
were
already
great
by
reason
of
constant
internal
dissension
the
highlanders
fought
always
on
foot
the
borderers
were
all
horsemen
the
borderers
spoke
the
same
language
as
the
lowlanders
wore
the
same
sort
of
dress
and
carried
the
same
arms
being
accustomed
to
fight
against
the
english
they
were
also
much
better
disciplined
than
the
highlanders
but
in
point
of
obedience
they
were
not
much
different
from
the
clans
of
the
north
military
officers
called
wardens
were
appointed
along
the
borders
to
keep
these
unruly
people
in
order
but
as
these
wardens
were
generally
chiefs
of
clans
they
did
not
do
much
to
mend
the
evil
the
good
lord
james
of
douglas
was
intrusted
with
a
great
part
of
the
charge
of
the
borders
by
robert
the
bruce
he
was
faithful
to
his
trust
but
the
clan
thus
acquired
power
which
was
afterward
dangerous
to
the
country
the
hostility
between
the
highlanders
and
the
lowlanders
was
only
equaled
by
the
hatred
both
felt
toward
their
saxon
neighbors
and
it
was
not
till
that
scotland
was
subjugated
by
england
the
conquest
was
so
complete
that
even
the
national
dress
was
abolished
the
old
gaelic
institutions
and
manners
were
modified
and
the
power
of
the
clan
chieftain
was
broken
with
the
last
struggle
of
the
exiled
stuart
party
which
ended
in
defeat
at
culloden
began
a
new
era
for
scotland
to
the
old
reign
of
lawlessness
and
disorder
succeeded
measures
that
were
wisely
coercive
and
which
finally
secured
a
unity
of
scottish
interests
and
greatly
augmented
prosperity
in
the
entire
kingdom
in
august
james
iv
of
scotland
married
princess
margaret
tudor
sister
of
henry
viii
of
england
it
was
hoped
that
this
alliance
would
be
the
means
of
ending
the
bitter
hostility
which
had
existed
between
scotland
and
england
since
the
time
of
edward
i
a
temporary
peace
ensued
but
it
was
not
till
a
century
later
that
a
descendant
of
the
scottish
james
sat
on
the
throne
of
england
the
only
son
of
james
iv
and
margaret
who
survived
infancy
was
james
james
of
the
poem
he
was
born
in
and
crowned
when
less
than
ten
years
old
his
father
having
been
slain
at
the
battle
of
flodden
field
which
had
resulted
so
disastrously
for
scotland
by
the
will
of
james
margaret
was
to
be
queen
regent
as
long
as
she
remained
a
widow
in
she
lost
the
regency
and
greatly
impaired
her
influence
by
marrying
archibald
douglas
earl
of
angus
bitter
enmity
already
existed
between
the
head
of
the
douglas
clan
and
other
scottish
nobles
and
when
angus
had
the
added
dignity
of
being
the
husband
of
the
queen
regent
the
jealousy
and
rivalry
were
greatly
increased
after
losing
the
regency
margaret
was
obliged
to
surrender
the
control
of
her
son
to
parliament
the
duke
of
albany
the
younger
son
of
james
was
appointed
regent
during
the
minority
of
the
king
albany
who
had
spent
many
years
at
the
luxurious
court
of
france
returned
to
his
native
country
with
no
appreciation
of
its
real
needs
and
little
sympathy
with
the
scotch
he
failed
to
administer
the
government
in
a
satisfactory
manner
angus
plotted
to
secure
control
of
affairs
and
to
gain
custody
of
the
young
king
he
assumed
all
the
authority
of
a
regent
without
possessing
any
claim
to
the
title
and
kept
james
under
close
guard
while
pretending
to
govern
the
realm
in
his
name
the
king
was
very
restive
under
this
irksome
and
unlawful
restraint
and
sympathized
strongly
with
efforts
which
were
made
for
his
release
in
two
armed
attempts
were
made
to
liberate
him
both
resulted
in
failure
what
could
not
be
accomplished
by
force
was
finally
secured
by
a
cleverly
planned
stratagem
of
the
royal
captive
and
he
escaped
to
stirling
castle
where
devoted
adherents
awaited
him
two
months
later
parliament
declared
the
estates
of
the
douglases
forfeited
to
the
crown
and
there
was
neither
place
nor
grace
left
in
scotland
for
any
bearing
the
obnoxious
name
james
even
extended
his
animosity
to
one
archibald
douglas
of
kilspendie
the
douglas
of
the
poem
to
whom
he
had
been
greatly
attached
a
touching
story
is
told
of
the
return
of
the
old
man
who
had
grown
weary
of
his
exile
in
england
and
longed
for
a
sight
of
scotland
and
the
former
friendly
regard
of
the
king
whom
he
had
never
personally
offended
he
was
doomed
to
undeserved
disappointment
however
as
james
was
unrelenting
in
his
resentment
and
would
not
modify
any
of
the
harsh
conditions
of
his
oath
against
the
hated
douglas
clan
although
one
of
the
most
formidable
obstacles
to
the
exercise
of
royal
rule
disappeared
with
the
crushing
of
the
power
of
the
douglases
james
still
met
much
opposition
from
the
nobility
there
were
many
abuses
connected
with
the
irregular
rule
exercised
during
his
minority
and
portions
of
the
kingdom
were
in
a
condition
of
great
lawlessness
which
made
it
necessary
for
him
to
resort
to
severe
measures
a
truce
was
concluded
with
england
in
which
allowed
him
to
devote
himself
to
the
internal
interests
of
scotland
the
following
year
he
began
to
reduce
the
rebellious
borders
to
submission
by
force
and
by
craft
he
brought
them
into
his
power
putting
to
death
many
of
the
great
nobles
and
greatly
limiting
the
privileges
of
those
he
allowed
to
live
until
some
degree
of
order
was
established
after
he
had
subdued
the
borders
he
proceeded
against
the
highland
chieftains
with
equal
rigor
the
insubordination
which
had
prevailed
in
that
part
of
scotland
yielded
to
the
unsparing
severity
of
james
and
life
and
property
became
measurably
secure
the
king
was
greatly
aided
in
the
execution
of
his
plans
by
the
clergy
whom
he
favored
in
many
ways
especially
by
countenancing
the
repression
of
heresy
a
course
quite
contrary
to
that
pursued
by
his
uncle
henry
viii
popular
sentiment
also
supported
this
king
of
the
commons
as
he
was
called
from
his
habit
of
mingling
with
the
common
people
and
taking
a
practical
interest
in
their
welfare
he
was
accustomed
to
travel
over
the
kingdom
in
disguise
that
he
might
learn
the
true
condition
of
his
subjects
and
investigate
the
administration
of
justice
this
custom
added
to
his
fondness
for
hunting
gave
him
an
intimate
acquaintance
with
his
kingdom
and
his
people
scott
says
of
him
he
was
handsome
in
his
person
and
resembled
his
father
in
the
fondness
for
military
exercises
and
the
spirit
of
chivalrous
honor
which
james
iv
loved
to
display
he
also
inherited
his
father
love
of
justice
and
his
desire
to
establish
and
enforce
wise
and
equal
laws
he
was
a
and
accomplished
man
and
like
his
ancestor
james
was
a
poet
and
a
musician
he
had
however
his
defects
he
avoided
his
father
failing
of
profusion
having
no
hoarded
treasures
to
employ
on
pomp
and
show
but
he
rather
fell
into
the
opposite
fault
being
of
a
temper
too
parsimonious
and
though
he
loved
state
and
display
he
endeavored
to
gratify
that
taste
as
economically
as
possible
so
that
he
has
been
censured
as
rather
close
and
covetous
it
must
be
added
that
when
provoked
he
was
unrelenting
even
to
cruelty
for
which
he
had
some
apology
considering
the
ferocity
of
the
subjects
over
whom
he
reigned
but
on
the
whole
james
was
an
amiable
man
and
a
good
sovereign
henry
viii
endeavored
to
enlist
the
aid
of
james
in
an
organized
resistance
to
the
authority
of
the
church
the
scottish
king
apparently
favored
in
a
measure
his
uncle
policy
but
his
alliance
with
france
restored
and
increased
his
adherence
to
papal
rule
the
failure
of
james
to
keep
an
appointment
made
for
meeting
king
henry
at
york
offended
the
latter
who
accused
him
of
dealing
treacherously
and
declared
war
against
scotland
many
of
the
scottish
nobles
were
disaffected
and
the
army
was
disorganized
at
solway
moss
james
was
openly
defied
by
his
nobility
scott
says
regarding
this
bitter
humiliation
he
shut
himself
up
in
the
palace
of
falkland
and
refused
to
listen
to
any
consolation
a
burning
fever
the
consequence
of
his
grief
and
shame
seized
on
the
unfortunate
monarch
they
brought
him
tidings
that
his
wife
had
given
birth
to
a
daughter
but
he
only
replied
it
so
reflecting
on
the
alliance
which
had
placed
the
stuart
family
on
the
throne
god
will
be
done
it
came
with
a
lass
and
it
will
go
with
a
lass
with
these
words
presaging
the
extinction
of
his
house
he
made
a
signal
of
adieu
to
his
courtiers
spoke
little
more
but
turned
his
face
to
the
wall
and
died
of
the
most
melancholy
of
all
diseases
a
broken
heart
the
story
of
the
lady
of
the
lake
is
briefly
as
follows
canto
a
huntsman
who
has
distanced
his
companions
and
lost
his
steed
which
urged
beyond
endurance
has
fallen
dead
in
the
trosachs
has
finally
wandered
over
rocky
ways
to
the
shore
of
loch
katrine
here
he
winds
his
horn
hoping
the
sounds
may
reach
his
comrades
in
response
a
skiff
appears
rowed
by
a
maiden
who
thinks
the
blast
was
from
her
father
horn
although
at
first
startled
she
is
reassured
by
the
wildered
wanderer
explanation
and
proffers
the
hospitality
of
her
father

they
row
across
the
lake
to
the

where
in
the
absence
of
the

margaret
dispense
true
highland
hospitality

styles
himself

fails
to
learn
the
names
of
his
hosts
the
stranger
bed
of
heather
was
spread
for
the
tired
huntsman
but
his
rest
was
disturbed
by
broken
dreams
in
which
the
exiled
douglases
played
a
prominent
part
canto
the
stranger
takes
his
leave
in
the
early
morning
allan
the
old
minstrel
tunes
his
harp
to
a
parting
song
and
ellen
watches
the
knight
wind
slowly
round
the
hill
then
chiding
herself
for
a
momentary
interest
in
him
she
bids
allan
sing
in
praise
of
the
græmes
one
of
whom
is
her
lover
the
old
man
is
brooding
over
the
ominous
fallen
sword
and
can
not
respond
he
foresees
the
demand
of
roderick
dhu
and
distrusts
the
parting
guest
their
conversation
is
interrupted
by
the
music
of

severely
as
he
has
already
done
with

and
that
the
retreat
of
the
outlawed

has
been
discovered
douglas
is
ready
to
withdraw
with
his

thus
lessening
the
danger
of
roderick
the

demands
his
alliance
and
the

of
his
daughter
both
are
refused
by
douglas
a
contest
arises
between

declares
his

frank
avowal

is
enlisted
and
he
leaves
with
her
a
ring
given
him
by
the
king
for
saving
his
life
this
he
says
if
presented
to
the

will
secure
his
protection
for

has
been
half
crazed
since
roderick

murdered
her
bridegroom
in
a
wild

her
incoherent
song
is

a
warning

slays
murdoch
and
returns
to

promises
to
avenge
her
and
fastens
to
his
bonnet
a
braid
of
her
own
and
her
bridegroom
hair
which
he
has
dipped
in
her
blood
continuing
his
way
alone
after
nightfall
he
comes
upon
the
camp
fire
of
a
stranger
who
gives
him
shelter
till
morning
when
he
promises
to
lead
him
on
his
journey

after
a
night
rest

a
hasty

meal
in

the

conducts
his

accordance
with
his
promise
and
highland
custom
allays
the
apprehension
of
an
attack
by
the
king
but
declares
his
hostility
to
roderick
dhu
and
avows
his
eagerness
to
meet
him
in
combat
the
guide
is
incensed
at
this
and
sounds
a
signal
which
brings
to
sight
armed
men
on
every
side
he
then
reveals
himself
as
roderick
dhu
he
is
bound
by
his
word
to
conduct
his
guest
to
coilantogle
ford
and
therefore
dismisses
his

when
this

is
reached
roderick
challenges
and
a
deadly
combat
ensues
throwing
away
his
shield

trusts
to

enemy
through
his
knowledge
of
fencing
and
finally
overpowers
him
winds
his
horn
which
is
answered
by
four
mounted
attendants
he
leaves
the
wounded
man
with
two
of
them
with
orders
to
bring
him
to
stirling

hastens
towards
the
castle
with
the
others

they
approach
it
they
perceive
douglas
who
comes
to
surrender
himself
to
the
king
hoping
thereby
to
secure
the
release
of
malcolm
græme
and
avert
the
danger
that
threatens

the

is
preparing

douglas
decides
to
join
in

may
attract
the
attention
of
the
king
he
surpasses
all
other
competitors
and
receives
the
prize
from
the
king
who
does
not
recognize
him
douglas
endures
this
in
silence
but
he
can
not
refrain
from
resenting
a
huntsman
cruelty
to
lufra
the
hound
companion
this
results
in
his
being
seized
and
taken
as
a
prisoner
to
the
castle
meantime
a
messenger
brings
to
the
king
tidings
of
the
rising
of
he
sends
a
hasty
message
to
avert
an
encounter

roderick
is
already
his
prisoner
in
stirling
stronghold
canto
this
canto
introduces
us
to
the
guard
room
in
stirling
castle
amid
the
remains
of
the
debauch
which
has
followed
the
games
of
the
previous
day
while
the
few
soldiers
who
remain
awake
are
finishing
their
carouse
and
talking
over
the
rumors
of
yesterday
battle
they
are
joined
by
one
of
their
mates
who
has
been
in
the
field
and
brings
with
him
a
maiden
and
a
minstrel
ellen
and
they
are
at
first
disposed
to
treat
the
maiden
roughly
but
the
sight
of
her
innocent
beauty
and
her
story
of
misfortune
touch
the
heart
of
one
of
the
roughest
in
the
company
who
becomes
her
champion
presently
they
are
joined
by
the
officer
of
the
guard
who
at
first
sight
of
ring
commits
the
lady
to
proper
care
while
john
of
brent
the
guardsman
who
had
interfered
grants
allan
request
to
see
his
master
but
fancying
that
the
minstrel
is
one
of
clansmen
he
shows
him
into
the
wrong
cell
where
he
finds
the
wounded
chief
after
anxious
inquiries
as
to
the
safety
of
his
kindred
roderick
asks
anew
of
the
fight
and
the
minstrel
in
spirited
verse
sings
of
the
battle
of
beal
an
duine
whose
issue
was
left
doubtful
by
the
arrival
of
a
messenger
from
the
king
with
orders
to
stay
the
fight
but
before
he
had
finished
his
song
the
stern
spirit
had
fled
and
the
minstrel
harp
changes
its
tune
from
battle
song
to
death
dirge
meanwhile
ellen
waits
anxiously
and
impatiently
for
her
audience
with
the
king

last
appears
to
escort
her
to
the
audience

faltering
she
looks
round
to
find
the
king
and
sees
to
her
surprise
that
her
companion
alone
remains
covered
and
knight
is
scotland
king
he
tells
her
how
the
feud
with
douglas
is
at
an
end
and
that
her
father
is
now
to
be
friend
and
bulwark
of
his
throne
but
she
still
has
the
ring
still
some
boon
to
ask
she
begs
for
roderick
life
but
that
is
past
giving
and
when
she
shrinks
from
further
request
the
king
calls
forth
malcolm
and
throws
over
him
a
golden
chain
which
he
gives
to
ellen

i

the

replied
as

i
well
believe
that
before
your

trod
loch

shore
but
yet
as
far
as
yesternight
old
foretold
your
plight
a

intent
was
on

he
saw
your

yon
two

so
dark

he
bade
that
all
should
ready
be
to

a

of

i
held

the

announced
by

of

me

the

to

your
fairy

the
maid
with
smile
suppress
and
sly
the
toil
unwonted
saw
him
try
for
seldom
sure
if
before
his
noble
hand
had
grasp
an
oar
yet
with
main
strength
his
strokes
he
drew
and

flew
with

does
the

the
stranger
view
the
shore
around
was
all
so
close
with
copsewood
bound
nor
track
nor

might
declare
that
human
foot
frequented
there
until
the
mountain
maiden
a
clambering
unsuspected
road
that
winded
through
the
tangled
screen
and
open
on
a
narrow
green
where
weeping
birch
and
willow
round
with
their
long
fibers
swept
the
ground
here
for
retreat
in
dangerous
hour
some
chief
had
framed
a
rustic
bower
xxvi
it
was
a
lodge
of
ample
size
but
strange
of

and
device
of
such
materials
as
around
the

had

by

rudely
squared
to
give
the

their
destined
height
the
sturdy
oak
and
ash
unite
while
moss
and
clay
and

combined
to
fence
each
crevice
from
the

lighter
pine

overhead
their
slender
length
for

spread
and
wither
heath
and
rushes
dry
supplied
a
russet
canopy
due
westward
fronting
to
the

a
rural
portico
was
seen
aloft
on
native
pillars
borne
of
mountain
fir
with

unshorn
where
ellen
hand
had
taught
to
twine
the
ivy
and

which
boasts
the

an
instant
in

to

my

must
be
my
gentle

in

thee
he
cross
the
threshold
and
a
clang
of
angry
steel
that
instant
rang
to
his
bold
brow
his
spirit
rush
but
soon
for
vain
alarm
he
blush
when
on
the
floor
he
saw
display
cause
of
the
din
a
naked
blade
dropp
from
the
sheath
that
careless
flung
upon
a

xxviii
the
wondering
stranger
round
him
gazed
and
next
the
fallen
weapon
raised
few
were
the
arms
whose
sinewy
strength
sufficed
to
stretch
it
forth
at
length
and
as
the
brand
he
poised
and
sway
i
never
knew
but
one
he
said
whose
stalwart
arm
might
brook
to
wield
a
blade
like
this
in

she
sighed
then
smiled
and
took
the
word
you
see
the
guardian
champion
sword
as
light
it
trembles
in
his
hand
as
in
my
grasp
a

might
reach
the

on

reclined
against

as

to

meditation
given
his

brow
was
raised
to

as
from

rising

to
claim
a
sparkle
of
inspiring
flame
his
hand
reclined
upon
the
wire
seem
watching
the
awakening
fire

still
he
sate
as
those
who
wait
till
judgment
speak
the
doom
of
fate
so
still
as
if
no
breeze
might
dare
to
lift
one
lock
of
hoary
hair
so
still
as
life
itself
were
fled
in
the
last
sound
his
harp
had

wherefore
sleeps
sir
roderick
dhu
apart
from

true
it
is
because
last
brian
an
augury
hath
tried
of
that
dread
kind
which
must
not
be
unless
in
dread
extremity
the
taghairm
call
by
which
afar
our
sires
foresaw
the
events
of

duncraggan
bull
they
slew

ah
well
the
gallant
brute
i
knew
the
choicest
of
the
prey
we
had
when
swept
our
merry
men
gallangad
his
hide
was
snow
his
horns
were
dark
his
red
eye
glow
like
fiery
spark
so
fierce
so
tameless
and
so
fleet
sore
did
he
cumber
our
retreat
and
kept
our
stoutest
kernes
in
awe
even
at
the
pass
of
beal
but
steep
and
flinty
was
the
road
and
sharp
the
hurrying
pikeman
goad
and
when
we
came
to
dennan
row
a
child
might
scathless
stroke
his
brow
an
old
highland
mode
of
reading
the
future
a
person
was
wrapped
up
in
the
skin
of
a
newly
slain
bullock
and
deposited
beside
a
waterfall
or
at
the
bottom
of
a
precipice
or
in
some
other
strange
wild
and
unusual
situation
in
this
situation
he
revolved
in
his
mind
the
question
proposed
and
whatever
was
impressed
upon
him
by
his
exalted
imagination
passed
for
the
inspiration
of
the
disembodied
spirits
who
haunt
the
desolate
recesses
south
of
loch
lomond
foot
soldiers
without
injury
norman
that
bull
was
slain
his
reeking
hide
they
stretch
the
cataract
beside
whose
waters
their
wild
tumult
toss
adown
the
black
and
craggy
boss
of
that
huge
cliff
whose
ample
verge
tradition
calls
the
hero
targe
couch
on
a
shelve
beneath
its
brink
close
where
the
thundering
torrents
sink
rocking
beneath
their
headlong
sway
and
drizzled
by
the
ceaseless
spray
midst
groan
of
rock
and
roar
of
stream
the
wizard
waits
prophetic
dream
nor
distant
rests
the
chief
but
hush
see
gliding
slow
through
mist
and
bush
the
hermit
gains
yon
rock
and
stands
to
gaze
upon
our
slumbering
bands
seems
he
not
malise
like
a
ghost
that
hovers
a
slaughter
host
or
raven
on
the
blasted
oak
that
watching
while
the
deer
is
broke
his
morsel
claims
with
sullen
croak
malise
peace
peace
to
other
than
to
me
thy
words
were
evil
augury
but
still
i
hold
sir
roderick
blade

and
her
aid
not
aught
that
glean
from
heaven
or
hell
yon
monk
can
tell
the
chieftain
joins
him

and
now
together
they
descend
the
brow
cut
up
vi
and
as
they
came
with
alpine
lord
the
hermit
monk
held
solemn
word
roderick
it
is
a
fearful
strife
for
man
endowed
with
mortal
life
whose
shroud
of
sentient
clay
can
still
feel
feverish
pang
and
fainting
chill
whose
eye
can
stare
in
stony
trance
whose
hair
can
rouse
like
warrior
lance
is
hard
for
such
to
view
unfurl
the
curtain
of
the

yet
witness
every
quaking
limb
my
sunken
pulse
my
eyeballs
dim
my

with
harrowing
anguish
torn

avouch
no
mortal
man
save
he
who
bred
between
the
living
and
the
dead
is
gifted
beyond
nature
law
had
survived
to
say
he
saw
at
length
the
fateful
answer
came
in
characters
of
living
flame
not
spoke
in
word
nor
blazed
in
scroll
but
borne
and
branded
on
my
soul

as
following

he
drew
that
seeming
lonesome
pathway
through
which
yet
by
fearful
proof
was
rife
with
lances
that
to
take
his
life
waited

from
a

suggestions
for
study
lady
of
the
is
usually
read
in
the
first
year
of
the
high
school
course
and
it
is
with
this
fact
in
mind
that
the
following
suggestions
have
been
made
it
is
an
excellent
book
with
which
to
begin
the
study
of
the
ordinary
forms
of
poetry
of
plot
structure
and
the
simpler
problems
of
description
for
this
reason
in
the
exercises
that
follow
the
emphasis
has
been
placed
on
these
topics
the
poem
lady
of
the
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
minor
epic
corresponding
to
the
arms
and
the
man
i
sing
of
the
æneid
and
the
invocation
to
the
muse
are
the
statement
of
the
theme
dauntless
deed
and
beauty
matchless
eye
and
the
invocation
to
the
harp
of
the
north
in
the
opening
stanzas
for
the
heroes
descendants
of
the
gods
of
the
great
epic
we
have
a
king
the
chieftain
of
a
great
clan
an
outlaw
earl
and
his
daughter
characters
less
elevated
than
those
of
the
great
epic
but
still
important
the
element
of
the
supernatural
brought
in
by
the
gods
and
goddesses
of
the
epic
is
here
supplied
by
the
minstrel
brian
the
priest
and
the
harp
the
interest
of
the
poem
lies
in
the
incidents
as
with
the
epic
the
romantic
story
of
ellen
and
malcolm
however
lies
quite
outside
the
realm
of
the
great
epic
which
is
concerned
with
the
fate
of
a
state
or
body
of
people
rather
than
with
that
of
an
individual
the
plot
there
are
two
threads
to
the
story
one
concerned
with
the
love
story
of
ellen
and
malcolm
the
main
plot
and
one
with
roderick
and
his
clan
against
the
king
the
minor
plot
the
connection
between
them
is
very
slight
the
story
of
ellen
could
have
been
told
almost
without
the
other
but
the
struggle
of
the
clan
makes
a
fine
background
for
the
love
story
of
ellen
and
malcolm
the
plot
is
an
excellent
one
for
the
beginner
to
study
as
the
structure
is
so
evident
the
following
is
a
simple
outline
of
the
main
incidents
of
the
story
i
the
complication
the
coming
of
the
stranger
later
supposed
by
roderick
to
be
a
spy
of
the
king
the
return
of
douglas
guided
by
malcolm
an
act
which
brings
malcolm
under
the
displeasure
of
the
king
roderick
proposal
for
ellen
hand
in
order
to
avert
the
danger
threatening
ellen
and
douglas
because
of
the
recognition
of
the
latter
by
the
king
men
the
rejection
of
the
proposal
leading
to
the
withdrawal
of
ellen
and
her
father
to
and
the
departure
of
douglas
to
the
court
to
save
roderick
and
malcolm
the
preparations
for
war
made
by
roderick
including
the
sending
of
the
fiery
cross
and
the
taghairm
ii
the

iii

scott
use
of
description
all
of
scott
works
afford
excellent
models
of
description
for
the
beginner
in
this
very
difficult
form
of
composition
he
deals
with
the
problems
of
description
in
a
simple
and
evident
manner
in
most
cases
he
begins
his
description
with
the
point
of
view
and
chooses
the
details
in
accordance
with
that
point
of
view
the
principle
of
order
used
in
the
arrangement
of
the
details
is
usually
easy
to
find
and
follow
and
the
beauty
of
his
contrasts
the
vanity
and
vividness
of
his
diction
can
be
in
a
measure
appreciated
even
by
boys
and
girls
in
the
first
year
of
the
high
school
if
properly
taught
a
pupil
must
leave
the
study
of
the
poem
with
a
new
sense
of
the
power
of
words
in
his
description
of
character
scott
deals
with
the
most
simple
and
elemental
emotions
and
is
therefore
fairly
easy
to
imitate
in
the
special
topics
under
each
canto
special
emphasis
has
been
laid
