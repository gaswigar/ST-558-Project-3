one
the
truce
of
god
i
now
the
day
of
the
birth
of
our
lord
dawned
that
year
grey
and
dreary
and
a
saturday
but
despite
the
weather
in
the
town
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
there
was
rejoicing
as
befitted
so
great
a
festival
the
day
before
a
fat
steer
had
been
driven
to
the
public
square
and
there
dressed
and
trussed
for
the
roasting
the
light
of
morning
falling
on
his
carcass
revealed
around
it
great
heaps
of
fruits
and
vegetables
for
the
year
had
been
prosperous
but
the
young
overlord
sulked
in
his
castle
at
the
cliff
top
and
bit
his
nails
from
thursday
evening
of
each
week
to
the
morning
of
monday
mother
church
had
decreed
peace
a
truce
of
god
three
full
days
out
of
each
week
his
polished
their
weapons
and
grew
fat
three
full
days
out
of
each
week
his
grudge
against
his
cousin
philip
of
the
black
beard
must
feed
on
itself
his
dark
mood
irritated
the
bishop
of
tours
who
had
come
to
speak
of
certain
scandalous
things
which
had
come
to
his
ears
charles
heard
him
through
she
took
refuge
with
him
he
said
violently
when
the
bishop
had
finished
she
knew
what
hate
there
was
between
us
yet
she
took
refuge
with
him
the
question
is
said
the
bishop
mildly
why
she
should
have
been
driven
to
refuge
a
gentle
lady
a
faithful
wife
deus
the
young
clapped
a
fist
on
the
table
you
know
well
the
reason
a
barren
woman
she
had
borne
you
a
daughter
but
charles
was
far
gone
in
rage
and
out
of
hand
the
bishop
took
his
offended
ears
to
bed
and
left
him
to
sit
alone
by
the
dying
fire
with
bitterness
for
company
came
into
the
courtyard
at
midnight
the
christmas
singers
from
the
town
the
blacksmith
rolling
a
great
bass
the
who
sang
falsetto
and
a
fool
of
the
village
who
had
slept
overnight
in
a
manger
on
the
holy
eve
a
year
before
and
had
brought
from
it
not
wit
but
a
voice
from
heaven
a
miracle
of
miracles
the
in
the
courtyard
stood
back
to
give
them
space
they
sang
with
eyes
upturned
with
vigour
albeit
a
bit
warily
with
an
anxious
glance
now
and
then
toward
those
windows
beyond
which
the
young
lord
sulked
by
the
fire
the
light
of
light
divine
true
brightness
undefiled
he
bears
for
us
the
shame
of
sin
a
holy
spotless
child
they
sang
to
the
frosty
air
when
neither
money
nor
burning
fagot
was
flung
from
the
window
they
watched
they
took
their
departure
relieved
if
unrewarded
in
former
years
the
lady
of
the
castle
had
thrown
them
alms
but
times
had
changed
now
the
gentle
lady
was
gone
and
the
sulked
in
the
hall
with
the
dawn
charles
the
fair
took
himself
to
bed
and
to
him
pattering
barefoot
along
stone
floors
came
clotilde
the
child
of
his
disappointment
are
you
asleep
one
arm
under
his
head
he
looked
at
her
without
answer
it
is
the
anniversary
of
the
birth
of
our
lord
she
ventured
today
he
is
born
i
thought
she
put
out
a
small
very
cold
hand
but
he
turned
his
head
away
back
to
your
bed
he
said
shortly
where
is
your
nurse
to
permit
this
the
child
face
fell
something
she
had
expected
some
miracle
perhaps
a
softening
of
the
lord
her
father
so
that
she
might
ask
of
him
a
christmas
boon
the
bishop
had
said
that
christmas
miracles
were
often
wrought
and
she
herself
knew
that
this
was
true
had
not
the
fool
secured
his
voice
so
that
he
who
had
been
but
lightly
held
became
the
village
troubadour
and
slept
warm
and
full
at
night
she
had
gone
to
the
bishop
with
this
the
night
before
if
i
should
lie
in
a
manger
all
night
she
said
standing
with
her
feet
well
apart
and
looking
up
at
him
would
i
become
a
boy
the
bishop
tugged
at
his
beard
a
boy
little
maid
would
you
give
up
your
blue
eyes
and
your
soft
skin
to
be
a
roystering
lad
my
father
wishes
for
a
son
she
had
replied
and
the
cloud
that
was
over
the
castle
shadowed
the
bishop
eyes
it
would
not
be
well
he
replied
to
tamper
with
the
works
of
the
almighty
pray
rather
for
this
miracle
that
your
father
heart
be
turned
toward
you
and
toward
the
lady
your
mother
so
during
much
of
the
night
she
had
asked
this
boon
steadfastly
but
clearly
she
had
not
been
heard
back
to
your
bed
said
her
father
and
turned
his
face
away
so
she
went
as
far
as
the
leather
curtain
which
hung
in
the
doorway
and
there
she
turned
why
do
they
sing
she
had
asked
the
bishop
of
the
blacksmith
and
the
others
and
he
had
replied
into
his
beard
to
soften
the
hard
of
heart
so
she
turned
in
the
doorway
and
sang
in
her
reedy
little
voice
much
thinned
by
the
cold
sang
to
soften
her
young
father
heart
the
light
of
light
divine
true
brightness
undefined
he
bears
for
us
the
shame
of
sin
a
holy
spotless
child
but
the
song
failed
perhaps
it
was
the
wrong
hour
or
perhaps
it
was
because
she
had
not
slept
in
the
manger
and
brought
forth
the
gift
of
voice
blood
of
the
martyrs
shouted
her
father
and
raised
himself
on
his
elbow
are
you
mad
get
back
to
your
bed
i
shall
have
a
word
with
someone
for
this
whether
it
had
softened
him
or
not
it
had
stirred
him
so
she
made
her
plea
it
is
his
birthday
i
want
to
see
my
mother
then
she
ducked
under
the
curtain
and
ran
as
fast
as
she
could
back
to
where
she
belonged
terror
winged
her
feet
she
had
spoken
a
forbidden
word
all
sleep
was
gone
from
charles
the
fair
he
lay
on
his
elbow
in
his
bed
and
thought
of
things
that
he
wished
to
forget
of
the
wife
he
had
put
away
because
in
eight
years
she
had
borne
him
no
son
of
his
great
lands
that
would
go
to
his
cousin
philip
of
the
black
beard
whom
he
hated
of
girls
in
the
plain
who
wooed
him
with
soft
eyes
and
whom
he
passed
by
of
a
jew
who
lay
in
a
dungeon
beneath
the
castle
because
of
usury
and
other
things
after
a
time
he
slept
again
but
lightly
for
the
sun
came
in
through
the
deep
unshaded
window
and
fell
on
his
face
and
on
the
rushes
that
covered
the
floor
and
in
his
sleep
the
grimness
was
gone
and
the
pride
and
his
mouth
which
was
sad
contended
with
the
firmness
of
his
chin
clotilde
went
back
to
her
bed
and
tucked
her
feet
under
her
to
warm
them
in
the
next
room
her
nurse
lay
on
a
bed
asleep
with
her
mouth
open
outside
in
the
stone
corridor
a
page
slept
on
a
skin
with
a
corner
over
him
against
the
draught
she
thought
things
over
while
she
warmed
her
feet
it
was
clear
that
singing
did
not
soften
all
hearts
perhaps
she
did
not
sing
very
well
but
the
bishop
had
said
that
after
one
had
done
a
good
act
one
might
pray
with
hope
she
decided
to
do
a
good
act
and
then
to
pray
to
see
her
mother
she
would
pray
also
to
become
a
boy
so
that
her
father
might
care
for
her
but
the
bishop
considered
it
a
little
late
for
such
a
prayer
she
made
terms
with
the
almighty
sitting
on
her
bed
i
shall
do
a
good
act
she
said
on
this
the
birthday
of
thy
son
and
after
that
i
shall
ask
for
the
thing
thou
knowest
of
after
much
thinking
she
decided
to
free
the
jew
and
being
after
all
her
father
own
child
she
acted
at
once
it
was
a
matter
of
many
cold
stone
steps
and
much
fumbling
with
bars
but
guillem
the
gaoler
had
crept
up
to
the
hall
and
lay
sleeping
by
the
fire
with
a
dozen
dogs
about
him
it
was
the
time
of
the
truce
of
god
and
vigilance
was
relaxed
also
guillem
was
in
love
with
a
girl
of
the
village
and
there
was
talk
that
the
in
his
loneliness
had
seen
that
she
was
beautiful
so
guillem
slept
to
forget
and
the
jew
lay
awake
because
of
rats
and
anxiety
the
jew
rose
from
the
floor
when
clotilde
threw
the
grating
open
and
blinked
at
her
with
weary
and
gentle
eyes
it
is
the
birthday
of
our
lord
said
clotilde
and
i
am
doing
a
good
deed
so
that
i
may
see
my
mother
again
but
go
quickly
then
she
remembered
something
the
bishop
had
said
to
her
and
eyed
him
thoughtfully
as
he
stared
at
her
but
you
do
not
love
our
lord
the
jew
put
out
his
foot
quietly
so
that
she
could
not
close
the
grating
again
but
he
smiled
into
her
eyes
your
lord
was
a
jew
he
said
this
reassured
her
it
seemed
to
double
the
quality
of
mercy
she
threw
the
door
wide
and
the
usurer
went
out
cautiously
as
if
suspecting
a
trap
but
patches
of
sunlight
barred
with
black
showed
the
way
clear
he
should
have
gone
at
once
but
he
waited
to
give
her
the
blessing
of
his
people
even
then
having
started
he
went
back
to
her
she
looked
so
small
in
that
fearsome
place
if
there
is
something
you
wish
little
maid
and
i
can
secure
it
for
you
i
wish
but
two
things
she
said
i
wish
to
be
a
boy
only
i
fear
it
is
too
late
for
that
the
bishop
thinks
so
and
i
wish
to
see
my
mother
and
these
being
beyond
his
gift
and
not
contained
in
the
pack
he
had
fastened
to
his
shoulders
he
only
shook
his
head
and
took
his
cautious
way
toward
freedom
having
tried
song
and
a
good
deed
clotilde
went
back
again
to
her
room
stepping
over
the
page
who
had
curled
himself
up
in
a
ball
like
a
puppy
and
still
slept
she
crossed
her
hands
on
her
breast
and
raised
her
eyes
as
she
had
been
taught
now
o
lord
she
said
i
have
tried
song
and
i
have
tried
a
good
deed
i
wish
to
see
my
mother
perhaps
it
was
merely
coincidence
that
the
level
rays
of
the
morning
sun
just
then
fell
on
the
crucifix
that
hung
on
the
wall
and
that
although
during
all
the
year
it
seemed
to
be
but
of
wood
and
with
closed
eyes
now
it
flashed
as
with
life
and
the
eyes
were
open
he
was
one
of
your
people
she
said
to
the
crucifix
and
by
now
he
is
down
the
hill
illustration
chapter
two
ii
now
it
was
the
custom
on
the
morning
of
the
holy
day
for
the
to
ride
his
finest
stallion
to
the
top
of
the
hill
where
led
a
steep
road
down
into
the
town
there
he
dismounted
surrounded
by
his
people
guests
and
soldiers
smaller
visiting
nobility
the
household
of
the
castle
and
the
stage
being
set
as
it
were
and
the
village
waiting
below
it
was
his
pleasure
to
give
his
charger
a
great
cut
with
the
whip
and
send
him
galloping
unridden
down
the
hill
the
horse
was
his
who
caught
it
below
waited
the
villagers
divided
between
terror
and
cupidity
above
waited
the
castle
folk
it
was
an
amusing
game
for
those
who
stood
safely
along
the
parapet
and
watched
one
that
convulsed
them
with
merriment
also
it
improved
the
quality
of
those
horses
that
grazed
in
the
plain
below
this
year
it
was
a
great
grey
that
carried
charles
out
to
the
road
that
clung
to
the
face
of
the
cliff
behind
him
on
a
donkey
reminder
of
the
humble
beast
that
had
borne
the
christ
into
jerusalem
rode
the
bishop
saddled
and
bridled
was
the
grey
with
a
fierce
head
and
great
shoulders
a
strong
beast
for
strong
days
the
were
drawn
up
in
a
double
line
weapons
at
rest
from
the
place
below
rose
a
thin
grey
smoke
where
the
fire
kindled
for
the
steer
but
the
crowd
had
deserted
and
now
stood
eyes
upraised
to
the
castle
and
to
the
cliff
road
where
waited
boys
and
men
ready
for
their
desperate
emprise
clad
in
such
protection
of
leather
as
they
could
afford
against
the
stallion
hoofs
two
people
only
remained
by
the
steer
an
aged
man
almost
blind
who
tended
the
fire
and
the
girl
joan
whom
guillem
slept
to
forget
the
has
ridden
out
of
the
gates
father
she
said
the
colour
mounted
to
her
dark
cheeks
she
was
tall
and
slender
unlike
the
peasant
girls
of
the
town
almost
noble
in
her
bearing
a
rare
flower
that
charles
in
his
rage
and
disappointment
would
pick
for
himself
and
were
you
not
undutiful
he
mumbled
you
would
be
with
him
now
and
looking
down
on
this
rabble
she
did
not
reply
at
once
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
frowning
castle
on
the
grim
double
line
of
at
the
massive
horse
and
its
massive
rider
i
too
should
be
up
there
whined
the
old
man
today
instead
of
delivering
christmas
dues
i
should
be
receiving
them
but
you
he
swung
on
her
malevolently
you
must
turn
great
toward
guillem
whose
most
courageous
work
is
to
levy
tribute
of
a
dungeon
she
flushed
i
am
afraid
father
he
is
a
hard
man
he
is
gentle
with
women
gentle
her
eyes
were
still
upraised
he
knows
not
the
word
when
he
looks
at
me
there
is
no
liking
in
his
eyes
i
am
frightened
the
overlord
sat
his
great
horse
and
surveyed
the
plain
below
as
far
as
he
could
see
and
as
far
again
in
every
direction
was
his
domain
paying
him
tithe
of
fat
cattle
and
heaping
granaries
as
far
as
he
could
see
and
as
far
again
was
the
domain
that
lacking
a
would
go
to
philip
his
cousin
the
bishop
who
rode
his
donkey
without
a
saddle
slipped
off
and
stood
beside
the
little
beast
on
the
road
his
finger
absently
traced
the
dark
cross
on
its
back
idiots
snarled
the
overlord
out
of
his
distemper
as
he
looked
down
into
the
faces
of
his
faithful
ones
below
fools
and
sons
of
fools
thy
beast
would
suit
them
better
bishop
than
mine
then
he
flung
himself
insolently
out
of
the
saddle
there
was
little
of
christmas
in
his
heart
god
knows
only
hate
and
disappointment
and
thwarted
pride
a
great
day
my
lord
said
the
bishop
peace
over
the
land
the
end
of
a
plentiful
year
bah
the
end
of
a
plentiful
year
repeated
the
bishop
tranquilly
this
day
of
his
birth
a
day
for
thanksgiving
and
for
bah
said
the
overlord
again
and
struck
the
grey
a
heavy
blow
so
massive
was
the
beast
so
terrific
the
pace
at
which
it
charged
down
the
hill
that
the
villagers
scattered
he
watched
them
with
his
lip
curling
see
he
said
brave
men
and
true
watch
father
how
they
rally
to
the
charge
and
when
the
creature
was
caught
and
a
swaying
figure
clung
to
the
bridle
by
the
cross
the
fool
has
him
a
fine
heritage
for
my
cousin
philip
a
village
with
its
bravest
man
a
simpleton
the
fool
held
on
swinging
his
arms
were
very
strong
and
as
is
the
way
with
fools
and
those
that
drown
many
things
went
through
his
mind
the
horse
was
his
he
would
go
adventuring
along
the
winter
roads
adventuring
and
singing
the
townspeople
gathered
about
him
with
sheepish
praise
from
a
dolt
he
had
become
a
hero
many
have
taken
the
same
step
in
the
same
space
of
moments
the
line
being
but
a
line
and
easy
to
cross
the
suited
the
grim
mood
of
the
overlord
it
pleased
him
to
see
the
smug
villagers
stand
by
while
the
fool
mounted
his
steed
side
by
side
from
the
parapet
he
and
the
bishop
looked
down
into
the
town
the
birthday
of
our
lord
bishop
he
said
with
fools
on
blooded
horses
and
the
courage
of
the
townspeople
in
their
stomachs
the
birthday
of
our
lord
said
the
bishop
tranquilly
with
a
lad
mounted
who
has
heretofore
trudged
afoot
and
with
the
hungry
fed
in
the
market
place
now
it
had
been
in
the
mind
of
the
bishop
that
the
day
would
soften
charles
grim
humour
and
that
he
might
speak
to
him
as
man
to
man
but
charles
was
not
softened
so
the
bishop
gathered
up
his
courage
his
hand
was
still
on
the
cross
on
the
donkey
back
you
are
young
my
son
and
have
been
grievously
disappointed
i
who
am
old
have
seen
many
things
and
this
i
have
learned
two
things
there
are
that
next
to
the
love
of
god
must
be
greatest
in
a
man
life
not
war
nor
slothful
peace
nor
pride
nor
yet
a
will
that
would
bend
all
things
to
its
end
the
overlord
scowled
he
had
found
the
girl
joan
in
the
market
square
and
his
eyes
were
on
her
one
said
the
bishop
is
the
love
of
a
woman
the
other
is
a
child
the
donkey
stood
meekly
with
hanging
head
a
woman
repeated
the
bishop
you
grow
rough
up
here
on
your
hillside
only
a
few
months
since
the
lady
your
wife
went
away
and
already
order
has
forsaken
you
the
child
your
daughter
runs
like
a
wild
thing
without
control
our
holy
church
deplores
these
things
will
holy
church
grant
me
another
wife
holy
church
replied
the
bishop
gravely
would
have
you
take
back
my
lord
the
wife
whom
your
hardness
drove
away
the
gaze
turned
to
the
east
where
lay
the
castle
of
philip
his
cousin
then
he
dropped
brooding
eyes
to
the
square
below
where
the
girl
joan
assisted
her
father
by
the
fire
and
moved
like
a
mother
of
kings
you
wish
a
woman
for
the
castle
father
he
said
then
a
woman
we
shall
have
holy
church
may
not
give
me
another
wife
but
i
shall
take
one
and
i
shall
have
a
son
the
child
clotilde
had
watched
it
all
from
a
window
because
she
was
very
high
the
thing
she
saw
most
plainly
was
the
cross
on
the
back
far
out
over
the
plain
was
a
moving
figure
which
might
or
might
not
have
been
the
jew
she
chose
to
think
it
was
one
of
your
people
she
said
toward
the
crucifix
i
have
done
the
good
deed
she
was
a
little
frightened
for
all
her
high
head
other
christmases
she
and
the
lady
her
mother
had
sat
hand
in
hand
and
listened
to
the
roystering
they
are
drunk
clotilde
would
say
but
her
mother
would
stroke
her
hand
and
reply
they
but
rejoice
that
our
lord
is
born
so
the
child
clotilde
stood
at
her
window
and
gazed
to
where
the
plain
stretched
as
far
as
she
could
see
and
as
far
again
and
there
was
her
mother
she
would
go
to
her
and
bring
her
back
or
perhaps
failing
that
she
might
be
allowed
to
stay
here
no
one
would
miss
her
the
odour
of
cooking
food
filled
the
great
house
loud
laughter
the
clatter
of
mug
on
board
her
old
nurse
was
below
decorating
a
boar
head
with
berries
and
a
crown
because
it
was
the
truce
of
god
and
a
festival
the
gates
stood
open
she
reached
the
foot
of
the
hill
safely
stragglers
going
up
and
down
the
steep
way
regarded
her
without
suspicion
so
she
went
through
the
square
past
the
roasting
steer
and
by
a
twisting
street
into
the
open
country
when
she
stopped
to
rest
it
was
to
look
back
with
wistful
eyes
toward
the
frowning
castle
on
the
cliff
for
a
divided
allegiance
was
hers
passionately
as
she
loved
her
mother
her
indomitable
spirit
was
her
father
heritage
his
fierceness
was
her
courage
and
she
loved
him
as
the
small
may
love
the
great
the
fool
found
her
at
the
edge
of
the
river
she
had
forgotten
that
there
was
a
river
he
was
on
his
great
horse
and
he
rode
up
by
the
child
and
looked
down
at
her
it
was
i
who
captured
him
he
boasted
the
others
ran
but
i
caught
him
so
he
dismounted
to
illustrate
it
is
not
because
you
were
brave
that
you
captured
him
then
why
he
stood
with
his
feet
wide
apart
looking
down
at
her
it
is
because
you
have
slept
in
a
manger
on
a
holy
eve
aye
he
responded
but
that
was
a
matter
of
courage
too
there
were
many
strange
noises
also
in
the
middle
of
the
night
came
our
lady
herself
and
said
to
me
thou
shalt
sing
with
the
voice
of
an
angel
i
should
like
to
see
our
lady
said
the
child
wistfully
also
pursued
the
fool
she
gave
me
power
over
great
beasts
see
he
fears
me
while
he
loves
me
and
indeed
there
seemed
some
curious
kinship
between
the
horse
and
the
lad
perhaps
because
the
barrier
of
keen
human
mind
was
not
between
them
think
you
said
the
little
maid
if
i
slept
where
you
did
she
would
appear
to
me
i
would
not
ask
much
only
to
be
made
a
lad
like
you
and
perhaps
to
sing
but
i
am
a
simpleton
instead
of
wit
i
have
but
a
voice
and
now
a
horse
a
lad
like
you
she
persisted
so
that
my
father
would
love
me
and
my
mother
might
come
back
again
better
stay
as
you
are
said
the
fool
also
there
will
be
no
holy
eve
again
for
a
long
time
it
comes
but
once
a
year
also
it
is
hard
times
for
men
who
must
either
fight
or
work
in
the
fields
i
he
struck
his
chest
i
shall
do
neither
and
i
shall
cut
no
more
wood
i
go
adventuring
clotilde
rose
and
drew
her
grey
cloak
around
her
i
am
adventuring
too
she
said
only
i
have
no
voice
and
no
horse
may
i
go
with
you
the
boy
was
doubtful
he
had
that
innate
love
and
tenderness
that
is
given
to
his
kind
instead
of
other
things
but
a
child
i
will
take
you
he
said
at
last
rather
heavily
but
where
little
lady
to
my
mother
at
the
castle
of
black
philip
and
when
his
face
fell
for
philip
was
not
named
the
black
only
for
his
beard
she
loves
singing
i
will
ask
you
to
sing
before
her
that
decided
him
he
took
her
before
him
on
the
grey
horse
and
they
set
off
two
valiant
adventurers
a
troubadour
and
a
lady
without
food
or
sufficient
clothing
but
with
high
courage
and
a
song
and
because
it
was
the
truce
of
god
the
children
went
unharmed
encountering
no
greater
adventure
than
hunger
and
cold
and
aching
muscles
robbers
sulked
in
their
fastnesses
and
their
horses
pawed
the
ground
murder
rapine
and
pillage
slept
that
christmas
day
under
the
shelter
of
the
cross
the
fool
who
ached
for
adventure
rather
resented
the
peace
wait
until
monday
he
said
from
behind
her
on
the
horse
i
shall
show
you
great
things
but
the
little
maid
was
cold
by
that
time
and
beginning
to
be
frightened
monday
you
may
fight
she
said
now
i
wish
you
would
sing
so
he
sang
until
his
voice
cracked
in
his
throat
because
it
was
christmas
and
because
it
was
freshest
in
his
heart
he
sang
mostly
what
he
and
the
blacksmith
and
the
had
sung
in
the
castle
yard
the
light
of
light
divine
true
brightness
undefiled
he
bears
for
us
the
shame
of
sin
a
holy
spotless
child
they
lay
that
night
in
a
ruined
barn
with
a
roof
of
earth
and
stones
clotilde
eyed
the
manger
wistfully
but
the
holy
eve
was
past
and
the
day
of
miracles
would
not
come
for
a
year
toward
morning
however
she
roused
the
boy
with
a
touch
she
may
have
forgotten
me
she
said
she
has
been
gone
since
the
spring
she
may
not
love
me
now
she
will
love
you
it
is
the
way
of
a
mother
to
keep
on
loving
i
am
still
a
girl
you
are
still
her
child
but
seeing
that
she
trembled
he
put
his
ragged
cloak
about
her
and
talked
to
comfort
her
although
his
muscles
ached
for
sleep
he
told
her
a
fable
of
the
countryside
of
that
abbot
who
having
duly
served
his
god
died
and
appeared
at
the
heavenly
gates
for
admission
a
slave
of
the
lord
he
replied
when
asked
his
name
but
he
was
refused
so
he
went
away
and
laboured
seven
years
again
at
good
deeds
and
returned
a
servant
of
the
lord
he
called
himself
and
again
he
was
refused
yet
another
seven
years
he
laboured
and
came
in
all
humility
to
the
gate
a
child
of
the
lord
said
the
abbot
who
had
gained
both
wisdom
and
humility
and
the
gates
opened

chapter
three
iii
all
that
day
came
peasants
up
the
hill
with
their
christmas
dues
of
one
fowl
out
of
eight
of
barley
and
wheat
the
courtyard
had
assumed
the
appearance
of
a
great
warehouse
those
that
were
prosperous
came
hissing
geese
and
chickens
and
grain
in
bags
across
the
saddle
the
poorer
trudged
afoot
among
the
latter
came
the
girl
joan
of
the
market
square
she
brought
no
grain
but
fowls
only
and
of
these
but
two
she
took
the
steep
ascent
like
a
thoroughbred
muscles
working
clean
under
glowing
skin
her
deep
bosom
rising
evenly
treading
like
a
queen
among
that
clutter
of
peasants
and
when
she
was
brought
into
the
great
hall
her
head
went
yet
higher
it
pleased
the
young
to
be
gracious
but
he
eyed
her
much
as
he
had
eyed
the
great
horse
that
morning
before
he
cut
it
with
the
whip
she
was
but
a
means
to
an
end
such
love
and
tenderness
as
were
in
him
had
gone
out
to
the
gentle
wife
he
had
put
away
from
him
and
had
died
of
clotilde
so
charles
appraised
her
and
found
her
although
but
a
means
very
beautiful
only
the
bishop
turned
away
his
head
joan
said
charles
do
you
know
why
i
have
sent
for
you
the
girl
looked
down
but
although
she
quivered
it
was
not
with
fright
i
do
sire
something
of
a
sardonic
smile
played
around
the
mouth
the
butterfly
came
too
quietly
to
the
net
we
are
but
gloomy
folk
here
rough
soldiers
and
few
women
it
has
been
in
my
mind
here
he
saw
the
bishop
averted
head
and
scowled
what
had
been
in
his
mind
he
forgot
he
said
i
would
have
you
come
willingly
or
not
at
all
at
that
she
lifted
her
head
and
looked
at
him
you
know
i
will
come
she
said
i
can
do
nothing
else
but
i
do
not
come
willingly
my
lord
you
are
asking
too
much
the
bishop
turned
his
head
hopefully
why
you
are
a
hard
man
my
lord
if
she
meant
to
anger
him
she
failed
they
were
not
soft
days
a
man
hid
such
tenderness
as
he
had
under
grimness
and
prayed
in
the
churches
for
phlegm
i
am
a
fighting
man
i
have
no
gentle
ways
then
a
belated
memory
came
to
him
i
give
no
tenderness
and
ask
none
but
such
kindness
as
you
have
lavish
on
the
child
clotilde
she
is
much
alone
with
the
mention
of
clotilde
name
came
a
vision
instead
of
this
splendid
peasant
wench
he
seemed
to
see
the
graceful
and
drooping
figure
of
the
woman
he
had
put
away
because
she
had
not
borne
him
a
son
he
closed
his
eyes
and
the
girl
taking
it
for
dismissal
went
away
when
he
opened
them
there
were
only
the
fire
and
the
dogs
about
it
and
the
bishop
who
was
preparing
to
depart
i
shall
not
stay
my
lord
said
the
bishop
the
thing
is
desecration
no
good
can
come
from
such
a
bond
it
is
christmas
and
the
truce
of
god
and
yet
you
do
this
evil
thing
so
the
bishop
went
muffled
in
a
cloak
and
mantled
with
displeasure
and
with
him
now
that
clotilde
had
fled
went
all
that
was
good
and
open
to
the
sun
from
the
grey
castle
of
charles
the
fair
at
evening
joan
came
again
still
afoot
but
now
clad
in
her
best
she
came
alone
and
the
men
at
the
gates
instructed
let
her
in
she
gazed
around
the
courtyard
with
its
burden
of
grain
that
had
been
crushed
out
of
her
people
below
with
its
loitering
soldiers
and
cackling
fowls
and
she
shivered
as
the
gates
closed
behind
her
she
was
a
good
girl
as
the
times
went
and
she
knew
well
that
she
had
been
brought
up
the
hill
as
the
stallion
that
morning
had
been
driven
down
she
remembered
the
cut
of
the
whip
and
in
the
twilight
of
the
courtyard
she
stretched
out
her
arms
toward
the
little
town
below
where
the
old
man
her
father
lived
in
and
where
on
that
christmas
evening
the
women
were
gathered
in
the
churches
to
pray
having
no
seasonable
merriment
in
himself
charles
surrounded
himself
that
night
with
cheer
a
band
of
wandering
minstrels
had
arrived
to
sing
the
great
fire
blazed
the
dogs
around
it
gnawed
the
bones
of
the
christmas
feast
but
when
the
troubadours
would
have
sung
of
the
nativity
he
bade
them
in
a
great
voice
to
have
done
so
they
sang
of
war
and
remembering
his
cousin
philip
his
eyes
blazed
when
joan
came
he
motioned
her
to
a
seat
beside
him
not
on
his
right
but
on
his
left
and
there
he
let
her
sit
without
speech
but
his
mind
was
working
busily
he
would
have
a
son
and
the
king
would
legitimise
him
then
let
philip
go
hang
these
lands
of
his
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
and
as
far
again
would
never
go
to
him
the
minstrels
sang
of
war
and
of
his
own
great
deeds
but
there
was
no
one
of
them
with
so
beautiful
a
voice
as
that
of
the
fool
who
could
sing
only
of
peace
and
the
fool
was
missing
however
their
songs
soothed
his
hurt
pride
this
was
he
these
things
he
had
done
if
the
bishop
had
not
turned
sour
and
gone
he
would
have
heard
what
they
sang
he
might
have
understood
too
the
craving
of
a
man
warrior
soul
for
a
warrior
son
for
one
to
hold
what
he
had
gathered
at
such
cost
back
always
to
this
burning
hope
of
his
joan
sat
on
his
left
hand
and
went
hot
and
cold
hot
with
shame
and
cold
with
fear
so
now
his
own
glory
as
a
warrior
commencing
to
pall
on
him
charles
would
have
more
tribute
this
time
as
lord
of
peace
he
would
celebrate
this
day
of
days
and
at
the
same
time
throw
a
sop
to
providence
he
would
release
the
jew
the
troubadours
sang
louder
fresh
liquor
was
passed
about
charles
waited
for
the
jew
to
be
brought
he
remembered
clotilde
then
she
should
see
him
do
this
noble
thing
since
her
mother
had
gone
she
had
shrunk
from
him
now
let
her
see
how
magnanimous
he
could
be
he
the
who
held
life
and
death
in
his
hands
would
this
day
give
not
death
but
life
being
not
displeased
with
himself
he
turned
at
last
toward
joan
and
put
a
hand
over
hers
you
see
he
said
i
am
not
so
hard
a
man
by
this
christian
act
shall
i
celebrate
your
arrival
but
the
jew
did
not
come
the
singers
learned
the
truth
and
sang
with
watchful
eyes
the
anger
was
known
to
be
mighty
and
to
strike
close
at
hand
guillem
the
gaoler
had
been
waiting
for
the
summons
news
had
come
to
him
late
in
the
afternoon
that
had
made
him
indifferent
to
his
fate
the
girl
joan
whom
he
loved
had
come
up
the
hill
at
the
overlord
summons
so
instead
of
raising
an
alarm
guillem
had
waited
sullenly
death
which
yesterday
he
would
have
blenched
to
behold
now
beckoned
him
when
he
was
brought
in
he
stood
with
folded
arms
and
asked
no
mercy
he
is
gone
my
lord
said
guillem
and
waited
he
did
not
glance
at
the
girl
gone
said
charles
then
he
laughed
such
laughter
as
turned
the
girl
cold
gone
how
now
perhaps
you
too
wished
to
give
a
hostage
to
fortune
to
forestall
me
in
mercy
he
turned
to
the
girl
beside
him
you
see
he
said
to
what
lengths
this
spirit
of
the
holy
day
extends
itself
our
friend
here
then
he
saw
her
face
and
knew
the
truth
the
smile
set
a
little
on
his
lips
why
then
he
said
to
the
gaoler
such
mercy
should
have
its
reward
he
turned
to
joan
what
say
you
shall
i
station
him
at
your
door
sweet
lady
as
a
guard
of
honour
things
went
merrily
after
that
for
guillem
drew
a
knife
and
made
not
for
the
but
for
joan
the
troubadours
feared
to
stop
singing
without
a
signal
so
they
sang
through
white
lips
the
dogs
gnawed
at
their
bones
and
the
sat
and
smiled
showing
his
teeth
guillem
finally
unhanded
stood
with
folded
arms
and
waited
for
death
it
is
the
time
of
the
truce
of
god
said
the
softly
and
knowing
that
death
would
be
a
boon
sent
him
off
unhurt
the
village
which
had
eaten
full
slept
early
that
night
down
the
hill
at
nine
came
half
a
dozen
on
horseback
and
clattered
through
the
streets
word
went
about
quickly
great
oaken
doors
were
unbarred
to
the
news
the
child
clotilde
is
gone
they
cried
through
the
streets
up
and
arm
the
child
clotilde
is
gone
joan
deserted
sat
alone
in
the
great
hall
for
the
was
off
riding
like
a
madman
flying
through
the
market
square
he
took
the
remains
of
the
great
fire
at
a
leap
he
had
but
one
thought
the
jew
had
stolen
the
child
therefore
to
find
the
jew
in
the
blackest
of
the
night
he
found
him
sitting
by
the
road
bent
over
his
staff
the
eyes
he
raised
to
charles
were
haggard
and
weary
charles
reined
his
horse
back
on
his
haunches
his
behind
him
what
have
you
done
with
the
child
the
child
out
with
it
cried
charles
and
flung
himself
from
his
horse
if
the
jew
were
haggard
charles
was
more
so
hard
bitten
of
terror
pallid
to
the
lips
i
have
seen
no
child
that
is
he
hastened
to
correct
himself
seeing
charles
face
in
the
light
of
a
torch
i
was
released
by
a
child
a
girl
i
have
not
seen
her
since
he
spoke
with
the
simplicity
of
truth
in
the
light
of
the
torches
charles
face
went
white
she
released
you
he
repeated
slowly
what
did
she
say
she
said
is
the
birthday
of
our
lord
repeated
the
jew
slowly
out
of
his
weary
brain
i
am
doing
a
good
deed
is
that
all
the
jew
hesitated
also
she
said
you
do
not
love
our
lord
charles
swore
under
his
breath
and
you
i
said
but
little
i
what
did
you
say
i
said
that
her
lord
was
also
a
jew
he
was
fearful
of
giving
offence
so
he
hastened
to
add
it
was
by
way
of
comforting
the
child
only
that
my
lord
she
said
nothing
else
the
voice
was
dangerously
calm
the
jew
faltered
he
knew
the
gossip
of
the
town
she
said
she
said
she
wished
two
things
my
lord
to
become
a
boy
and
to
see
her
mother
then
charles
lifted
his
face
to
where
the
stars
were
growing
dim
before
the
uprising
of
the
dawn
and
where
as
far
away
as
the
eye
could
reach
and
as
far
again
lay
the
castle
of
his
cousin
philip
of
the
black
beard
and
the
rage
was
gone
out
of
his
eyes
for
suddenly
he
knew
that
on
that
feast
of
mother
and
child
clotilde
had
gone
to
her
mother
as
unerringly
as
an
arrow
to
its
mark
and
with
the
rage
died
all
the
passion
and
pride
in
the
eyes
that
had
gazed
at
joan
over
the
parapet
and
that
now
turned
to
the
east
there
was
reflected
the
dawning
of
a
new
day
the
castle
of
philip
the
black
lay
in
a
plain
for
as
much
as
a
mile
in
every
direction
the
forest
had
been
sacrificed
against
the
loving
advances
of
his
cousin
charles
also
about
the
castle
was
a
moat
in
which
swam
noisy
geese
and
much
litter
when
shortly
after
dawn
the
sentry
at
the
drawbridge
saw
a
great
horse
with
a
double
burden
crossing
the
open
space
he
was
but
faintly
interested
a
belated
peasant
with
his
christmas
dues
perhaps
but
when
on
the
lifting
of
the
morning
haze
he
saw
that
the
horse
bore
two
children
and
one
a
girl
he
called
another
man
to
look
troubadours
by
the
sound
said
the
newcomer
for
the
fool
was
singing
to
cheer
his
lack
of
breakfast
coming
empty
of
belly
as
come
all
troubadours
but
the
sentry
was
dubious
minstrels
were
a
slothful
lot
averse
to
the
chill
of
early
morning
and
when
the
pair
came
nearer
and
drew
up
beyond
the
moat
the
soldiers
were
still
at
a
loss
the
fool
wandering
eyes
and
tender
mouth
bespoke
him
no
troubadour
and
the
child
rode
with
head
high
like
a
princess
i
have
come
to
see
my
mother
clotilde
called
and
demanded
admission
clearly
here
were
no
warriors
but
a
fool
and
a
child
so
they
let
down
the
bridge
and
admitted
the
pair
but
they
raised
the
bridge
at
once
again
against
the
loving
advances
of
philip
cousin
charles
but
once
in
the
courtyard
clotilde
courage
began
to
fail
her
would
her
mother
want
her
prayer
had
been
unavailing
and
she
was
still
a
girl
and
at
first
it
seemed
as
though
her
fears
had
been
justified
although
they
took
her
into
the
castle
kindly
enough
and
offered
her
food
which
she
could
not
eat
and
plied
her
with
questions
which
she
could
not
answer
i
want
my
mother
was
the
only
thing
they
could
get
out
of
her
her
little
body
was
taut
as
a
bowstring
her
lips
tight
they
offered
her
excuses
the
lady
mother
slept
now
she
was
rising
and
must
be
clothed
and
then
at
last
they
told
her
because
of
the
hunted
look
in
her
eyes
she
is
ill
they
said
wait
but
a
little
and
you
shall
see
her
deadly
despair
had
clotilde
in
its
grasp
with
that
announcement
these
strange
folk
were
gentle
enough
with
her
but
never
before
had
her
mother
refused
her
the
haven
of
her
arms
besides
they
lied
their
eyes
were
shifty
she
could
see
in
their
faces
that
they
kept
something
from
her
philip
having
confessed
himself
overnight
by
was
at
mass
when
the
pair
arrived
three
days
one
must
rot
of
peace
and
those
three
days
to
be
not
entirely
lost
he
prayed
for
success
against
charles
or
for
another
thing
that
lay
close
to
his
heart
but
not
for
both
together
since
that
was
not
possible
he
knelt
stiffly
in
his
cold
chapel
and
made
his
supplications
but
he
was
not
too
engrossed
to
hear
the
drawbridge
chains
and
to
pick
up
his
ears
to
the
clatter
of
the
grey
horse
so
having
been
communicated
he
made
short
shift
of
what
remained
to
be
done
and
got
to
his
feet
the
abbot
whose
offices
were
finished
had
also
heard
the
drawbridge
chains
and
let
him
go
when
philip
saw
clotilde
he
frowned
and
then
smiled
he
had
sons
but
no
daughter
and
he
would
have
set
her
on
his
shoulder
but
she
drew
away
haughtily
so
philip
sat
in
a
chair
and
watched
her
with
a
curious
smile
playing
about
his
lips
surely
it
were
enough
to
make
him
smile
that
he
should
play
host
to
the
wife
and
daughter
of
his
cousin
charles
because
of
that
and
of
the
thing
that
he
had
prayed
for
and
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eyes
black
philip
alternately
watched
the
child
and
from
a
window
the
plain
which
was
prepared
against
his
cousin
and
as
he
had
expected
at
ten
in
the
morning
came
charles
and
six
riding
like
demons
and
jerked
up
their
horses
at
the
edge
of
the
moat
philip
still
with
the
smile
under
his
black
beard
went
out
to
greet
them
well
met
cousin
he
called
you
ride
fast
and
early
charles
eyed
him
with
feverish
eyes
truce
of
god
he
said
sulkily
from
across
the
moat
and
then
we
seek
a
runaway
the
child
clotilde
i
shall
make
inquiry
said
philip
veiling
the
twinkle
under
his
heavy
brow
in
such
a
season
many
come
and
go
but
in
his
eyes
charles
read
the
truth
and
breathed
with
freer
breath
they
lowered
the
drawbridge
again
with
a
great
creaking
of
windlass
and
chain
and
charles
with
his
head
up
rode
across
but
his
stood
their
horses
squarely
on
the
bridge
so
that
it
could
not
be
raised
and
philip
smiled
into
his
beard
charles
dismounted
stiffly
he
had
been
a
night
in
the
saddle
and
his
horse
staggered
with
fatigue
in
philip
courtyard
as
in
his
own
were
piled
high
the
christmas
tithes
a
good
year
said
philip
agreeably
and
indicated
the
dues
peaceful
times
eh
cousin
but
charles
only
turned
to
see
that
his
men
kept
the
drawbridge
open
and
followed
him
into
the
house
once
inside
however
he
turned
on
philip
fiercely
i
am
not
here
of
my
own
desire
it
appears
that
both
my
wife
and
child
find
sanctuary
with
you
tut
said
philip
it
is
the
christmas
season
man
and
a
sunday
we
will
not
quarrel
as
to
the
why
of
your
coming
where
is
she
your
wife
or
clotilde
now
all
through
the
early
morning
charles
had
longed
for
one
as
for
the
other
but
there
was
nothing
of
that
in
his
voice
clotilde
he
said
i
shall
make
inquiry
if
she
has
arrived
mumbled
philip
into
his
beard
and
went
away
so
it
came
about
that
charles
was
alone
when
he
saw
the
child
and
caught
her
up
in
his
hungry
arms
as
for
clotilde
her
fear
died
at
once
in
his
embrace
when
philip
returned
he
found
them
thus
and
coughed
discreetly
so
charles
released
the
child
and
put
her
on
her
feet
i
have
said
philip
another
member
of
your
family
under
my
roof
as
to
whom
you
have
made
no
inquiry
i
have
secured
that
for
which
i
came
said
charles
haughtily
but
his
eyes
were
on
philip
and
a
question
was
in
them
philip
however
was
not
minded
to
play
charles
game
but
his
own
and
that
not
too
fast
in
that
event
cousin
he
replied
let
the
little
maid
eat
and
then
take
her
away
and
since
it
is
a
sunday
and
the
truce
of
god
we
can
drink
to
the
christmas
season
even
quarrelling
dogs
have
intervals
of
peace
so
perforce
because
the
question
was
still
in
his
heart
if
not
in
his
eyes
charles
drank
with
his
cousin
and
enemy
philip
but
with
his
hand
in
that
small
hand
of
clotilde
which
was
so
like
her
mother
philip
expansiveness
extended
itself
to
the
who
still
sat
woodenly
on
the
drawbridge
he
sent
them
hot
liquor
for
the
day
was
cold
and
at
such
intervals
as
charles
questioning
eyes
were
turned
away
he
rubbed
his
hands
together
furtively
as
a
man
with
a
secret
a
prosperous
year
said
philip
charles
grunted
we
shall
have
snow
before
night
said
philip
humph
said
charles
and
glanced
toward
the
sky
but
made
no
move
to
go
the
child
is
growing
to
this
charles
made
no
reply
whatever
and
philip
bleated
on
her
mother
body
he
said
but
your
eyes
and
hair
cousin
charles
could
stand
no
more
he
pushed
the
child
away
and
rose
to
his
feet
philip
to
give
him
no
tithe
of
advantage
rose
too
now
said
charles
squarely
where
is
my
wife
is
she
hiding
from
me
then
philip
face
must
grow
very
grave
and
his
mouth
set
in
sad
lines
she
is
ill
charles
i
would
have
told
you
sooner
but
you
lacked
interest
charles
swallowed
to
steady
his
voice
how
ill
a
short
and
violent
illness
said
philip
all
of
last
night
the
women
have
been
with
her
and
this
morning
he
glanced
toward
the
window
i
was
right
as
you
see
cousin
it
is
snowing
charles
clutched
him
by
the
arm
and
jerked
him
about
what
about
this
morning
he
roared
snow
on
christmas
mused
philip
prophesies
another
prosperous
year
then
having
run
his
quarry
to
earth
he
showed
mercy
would
you
like
to
see
her
charles
swallowed
again
this
time
his
pride
i
doubt
if
she
cares
to
see
me
probably
not
said
philip
still
a
few
words
she
is
a
true
woman
and
kindly
also
it
is
a
magnanimous
season
but
you
must
tread
softly
and
speak
fair
this
is
no
time
for
a
high
hand
charles
perforce
must
promise
mildness
he
made
the
concession
with
poor
grace
but
he
made
it
and
in
philip
eyes
grew
a
new
admiration
for
this
hulking
cousin
and
enemy
who
ate
his
pride
for
a
woman
at
the
entrance
to
an
upper
room
where
hung
a
leather
curtain
he
stood
aside
softly
he
said
through
his
beard
no
harsh
words
send
the
child
in
first
so
philip
went
ponderously
away
and
left
charles
to
cool
his
heels
and
wait
as
he
stood
there
sheepishly
he
remembered
many
things
with
shame
joan
and
the
violence
of
the
last
months
and
the
bishop
averted
head
for
now
he
knew
one
thing
and
knew
it
well
the
lady
of
his
heart
lay
in
that
quiet
room
beyond
and
the
devils
that
had
fought
in
him
were
dead
of
a
christmas
peace
little
cries
came
to
him
clotilde
soft
weeping
and
another
voice
that
thrilled
him
filled
with
the
wooing
note
that
is
in
a
voice
when
she
speaks
to
her
child
but
it
was
a
feeble
voice
and
its
weakness
struck
terror
to
his
soul
what
was
this
thing
for
which
he
had
cast
her
away
now
that
he
might
lose
her
his
world
shook
under
his
feet
his
cousin
and
enemy
was
become
his
friend
his
world
which
he
had
thought
was
his
own
domain
as
far
from
his
castle
as
the
eye
could
reach
and
as
far
again
was
in
an
upper
room
of
philip
house
and
dying
perhaps
but
she
was
not
dying
they
admitted
him
in
time
to
save
his
pride
for
he
was
close
to
distraction
and
being
admitted
he
saw
only
the
woman
he
had
put
away
he
went
straight
to
his
wife
bed
and
dropped
on
his
knees
beside
it
not
for
his
life
could
he
have
spoken
then
inarticulate
things
were
in
his
mind
remorse
and
the
loneliness
of
the
last
months
and
the
shame
of
the
girl
joan
he
caught
her
hand
to
him
and
covered
it
with
kisses
i
have
tried
to
live
without
you
he
said
and
death
itself
were
better
when
she
did
not
reply
but
lay
back
white
to
the
lips
he
rose
and
looked
down
at
her
i
can
see
he
said
that
my
touch
is
bitterness
i
have
merited
nothing
better
so
i
shall
go
again
but
this
time
if
it
will
comfort
you
i
shall
give
you
the
child
clotilde
not
that
i
love
her
the
less
but
that
you
deserve
her
the
more
then
she
opened
her
eyes
and
what
he
saw
there
brought
him
back
to
his
knees
with
a
cry
i
want
only
your
love
my
lord
to
make
me
happy
she
said
and
now
see
how
the
birthday
of
our
lord
has
brought
us
peace
she
drew
down
the
covering
a
trifle
close
to
his
bent
head
and
showed
the
warm
curve
of
her
arm
unto
us
also
is
born
a
son
charles
i
have
wanted
a
son
said
charles
the
fair
but
more
than
a
son
have
i
wanted
you
heart
of
my
heart
outside
in
the
courtyard
the
fool
had
drawn
a
circle
about
him
i
am
adventuring
he
said
yesterday
i
caught
this
horse
when
the
others
ran
from
him
then
i
saved
a
lady
and
brought
her
to
her
destination
this
being
the
christmas
season
and
a
sunday
i
shall
rest
here
for
a
day
he
threw
out
his
chest
magnificently
but
tomorrow
i
continue
on
my
way
can
you
fight
they
baited
him
i
can
sing
he
replied
and
he
threw
back
his
head
with
its
wandering
eyes
and
tender
mouth
and
sang
the
light
of
light
divine
true
brightness
undefiled
he
bears
for
us
the
shame
of
sin
a
holy
spotless
child
