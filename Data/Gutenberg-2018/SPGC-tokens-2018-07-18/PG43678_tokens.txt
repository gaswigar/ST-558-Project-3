shakspeare
editor
introduction
to
anne
of
geierstein
with
the
fair
maid
of
perth
we
take
farewell
of
scott
at
his
best
though
even
from
the
stubble
one
may
tell
what
the
grain
has
been
anne
of
geierstein
was
no
favourite
of
the
author
and
as
matthew
arnold
says
the
world
does
not
contemplate
with
pleasure
what
the
poet
creates
without
joy
the
novel
was
begun
in
the
late
summer
or
autumn
of
but
for
part
of
the
time
scott
neglected
his
diary
he
was
become
june
a
writing
automaton
and
suffered
much
pain
from
rheumatism
and
rheumatic
headaches
he
feared
that
this
affected
the
quality
of
the
stuff
but
he
was
not
one
who
waited
for
the
spark
from
heaven
to
fall
he
plodded
on
in
these
late
years
of
old
the
goddess
had
generally
been
willing
but
now
his
task
took
the
likeness
of
journalism
the
round
had
to
be
trodden
be
he
well
or
be
he
ill
masterpieces
are
not
written
thus
it
is
the
moral
effort
that
we
admire
and
the
contempt
for
fame
even
for
art
compared
with
the
respect
for
duty
scott
believed
in
his
duty
and
in
his
power
of
will
but
imagination
will
not
obey
a
moral
dictate
we
find
ballantyne
complaining
of
his
manuscript
the
wearied
hand
no
longer
wrote
legibly
despite
the
mechanical
supports
which
he
used
i
can
not
trace
my
de
but
with
great
labour
and
trouble
june
he
wrought
and
endured
afflicted
by
a
hypochondriacal
melancholy
it
may
be
chased
away
by
study
or
by
exercise
he
is
nobly
master
of
his
fate
in
every
event
in
july
we
find
him
beginning
simond
in
search
of
local
colour
for
he
did
not
know
switzerland
nor
even
the
rhine
his
description
of
a
storm
in
the
mountains
is
in
the
circumstances
wonderfully
accurate
he
simply
drew
the
hills
above
loch
skene
on
a
grander
scale
morritt
and
sir
james
stuart
of
allanbank
who
were
well
acquainted
with
the
scenes
were
surprised
at
the
felicity
with
which
he
divined
its
character
and
outdid
by
the
force
of
imagination
all
the
efforts
of
a
thousand
actual
tourists
their
praise
much
encouraged
sir
walter
lockhart
ix
ballantyne
bored
and
bothered
me
with
his
criticisms
he
said
for
he
did
not
pretend
to
be
a
geologist
and
to
describe
the
formation
of
the
rocks
in
january
he
muzzed
on
i
can
call
it
little
better
with
anne
of
geierstein
the
materials
are
excellent
but
the
power
of
using
them
is
failing
in
february
he
was
better
pleased
with
his
work
the
reason
why
he
was
better
pleased
may
perhaps
be
gathered
from
his
journal
i
called
on
skene
and
borrowed
a
volume
of
his
journal
to
get
some
information
about
burgundy
and
provence
something
may
be
made
out
of
king
rené
but
i
wish
i
had
thought
of
him
sooner
this
is
elucidated
by
a
note
of
skene
sir
walter
wished
to
see
a
paper
which
i
had
some
time
before
contributed
to
the
memoirs
of
the
society
of
antiquaries
on
the
subject
of
the
secret
tribunals
of
germany
and
upon
which
accordingly
he
grounded
his
scene
in
the
novel
skene
now
suggested
the
introduction
of
king
rené
of
provence
as
he
himself
could
give
topographical
details
he
liked
the
idea
much
and
the
whole
dénouement
of
the
story
was
changed
and
the
provence
part
woven
into
it
in
the
form
in
which
it
ultimately
came
forth
journal
ii
note
on
march
cadell
totally
condemns
of
geierstein
great
dishonour
in
this
as
trinculo
says
besides
an
infinite
loss
yet
worse
has
succeeded
but
it
was
while
the
fashion
of
the
thing
was
fresh
i
retrenched
a
good
deal
about
the
troubadours
which
was
really
de
april
after
some
weeks
of
work
and
reflection
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
more
pains
would
not
serve
his
turn
inspiration
came
at
once
if
it
came
at
all
and
now
his
braes
and
were
ceasing
to
inspire
him
i
do
know
why
or
wherefore
but
i
hate
april
the
story
will
end
and
shall
end
because
it
must
end
and
so
here
goes
he
finished
anne
of
geierstein
on
april
and
began
an
historical
work
for
lardner
on
the
same
day
he
had
been
writing
reviews
and
other
trifles
all
the
time
were
necessity
out
of
the
question
i
would
take
the
same
literary
labour
from
choice
something
more
leisurely
though
the
book
was
published
in
the
middle
of
may
and
was
very
popular
in
switzerland
lockhart
praises
occasional
outbursts
of
the
old
poetic
spirit
as
in
the
alpine
storm
the
wild
climb
of
arthur
the
duel
the
noble
picture
of
the
battle
of
granson
no
one
else
then
writing
in
england
could
have
matched
these
passages
lockhart
especially
admired
the
sympathy
with
which
an
old
and
weary
man
depicts
the
feelings
of
youth
with
all
their
original
glow
and
purity
he
was
always
living
over
again
in
his
children
young
at
heart
whenever
he
looked
on
them
and
the
world
that
was
opening
on
them
and
their
friends
but
above
all
he
had
a
firm
belief
in
the
future
reunion
of
those
whom
death
had
parted
the
novel
is
unlucky
perhaps
in
the
period
chosen
which
is
not
sufficiently
familiar
to
most
readers
the
forlorn
cause
of
the
house
of
lancaster
now
affects
us
very
little
and
the
passion
of
margaret
of
anjou
is
remote
it
can
not
stir
us
like
the
last
view
of
the
king
in
redgauntlet
the
mechanism
of
the
volume
does
suggest
the
favourite
topics
of
radcliffe
and
the
mysterious
appearances
and
disappearances
of
the
heroine
need
a
more
plausible
explanation
than
they
receive
the
prophecy
turning
on
the
drawing
of
the
bow
is
rather
dropped
out
of
sight
and
the
magic
scenes
connected
with
the
opal
and
the
mysterious
bride
suffer
from
being
explained
away
the
miracle
is
more
easy
of
belief
than
the
explanation
though
charles
the
bold
is
painted
with
power
in
his
pride
and
in
his
fall
he
does
not
interest
us
like
louis
xi
or
james
either
in
this
novel
or
in
quentin
durward
it
is
probable
enough
that
scott
in
his
intended
continuation
of
quentin
durward
had
this
very
period
in
his
eye
perhaps
we
need
not
regret
that
with
failing
powers
he
left
quentin
out
of
the
tale
his
place
is
filled
by
the
good
dull
sigismund
who
always
warms
up
into
a
kind
of
brilliance
when
action
is
to
be
taken
or
described
the
hero
and
heroine
do
not
differ
much
from
usual
characters
in
similar
romantic
circumstances
but
anne
has
less
of
originality
and
charm
of
course
than
the
women
of
his
earlier
novels
the
story
even
on
the
least
favourable
estimate
is
a
rapid
novel
of
adventure
incident
follows
incident
and
as
a
modern
critic
says
the
novel
of
character
is
one
we
often
take
up
the
novel
of
incident
is
one
we
can
not
lay
down
if
it
be
written
with
the
spirit
of
scott
or
of
dumas
that
friendly
master
of
romance
was
just
about
to
take
up
the
pen
which
fell
from
the
fingers
of
sir
walter
uno
avulso
non
deficit
alter
scott
imitators
in
his
lifetime
produced
little
or
nothing
of
merit
he
was
however
to
leave
successors
the
author
of
vingt
ans
après
first
and
greatest
the
author
of
esmond
the
author
we
may
surely
add
of
the
master
of
ballantrae
much
as
these
differ
from
scott
both
in
quantity
and
quality
of
genius
in
method
in
style
they
are
all
sealed
of
his
tribe
like
the
spiritual
children
of
ben
jonson
scott
is
he
without
whose
life
they
had
not
been
and
thus
his
example
has
borne
and
still
bears
new
fruit
in
the
most
innocent
of
intellectual
pleasures
for
a
later
generation
scott
has
done
what
the
romances
and
the
epics
did
for
chivalry
and
for
all
the
world
in
an
unexpected
place
the
memoirs
of
adam
clarke
we
find
a
tribute
to
old
romance
and
had
he
not
read
these
in
boyhood
the
learned
and
excellent
doctor
declares
his
religion
would
have
lacked
imagination
and
his
character
the
courage
which
he
displayed
in
face
of
many
dangers
examples
of
lofty
fancy
of
chivalrous
courage
all
that
can
attract
and
inspire
youth
all
that
makes
against
moody
despair
and
stolid
commonplace
and
creeping
prose
scott
gives
even
in
this
late
work
and
he
enlightens
all
with
humour
as
in
his
admirable
description
of
the
despotic
german
innkeeper
before
whom
the
earl
of
oxford
has
to
lower
his
bonnet
while
youth
is
youth
and
men
have
yet
a
smack
of
it
we
can
be
happy
with
arthur
philipson
in
his
duel
with
sigismund
in
the
fight
with
the
cheery
maid
of
anne
of
geierstein
and
her
honest
ideas
of
love
on
first
principles
with
that
royal
philosopher
king
rené
with
the
sagacious
loyalty
of
oxford
and
the
manly
patriotism
of
the
peasant
noble
that
the
conclusion
is
entangled
and
the
knots
rather
broken
than
disengaged
is
no
unusual
fault
in
scott
it
haunted
his
works
from
the
beginning
considering
his
health
his
absence
in
this
tale
from
scenes
familiar
to
him
and
times
familiar
to
his
readers
the
novel
is
remarkable
for
its
interest
what
success
and
merit
it
possesses
are
mainly
due
however
to
a
determined
effort
of
the
will
not
to
a
delighted
and
conscious
inspiration
in
his
last
essays
though
the
will
was
indomitable
the
material
machinery
of
the
brain
was
shattered
and
we
can
only
criticise
them
as
psychological
examples
of
unconquered
courage
he
had
to
see
james
ballantyne
broken
by
his
wife
death
and
squandering
his
thoughts
and
senses
upon
dowdy
metaphysics
and
abstruse
theology
it
was
better
for
scott
to
work
on
and
die
at
his
task
at
the
labour
of
a
life
which
would
not
be
complete
would
not
offer
the
same
invigorating
spectacle
had
he
thrown
his
pen
away
and
confessed
himself
defeated
the
historical
sources
of
anne
of
geierstein
are
explained
in
scott
own
introduction
and
notes
all
the
later
part
of
the
novel
follows
the
narrative
of
commines
closely
save
for
certain
dramatic
liberties
as
we
shall
point
out
in
our
additional
annotations
andrew
lang
introduction
to
anne
of
geierstein
this
novel
was
written
at
a
time
when
circumstances
did
not
place
within
my
reach
the
stores
of
a
library
tolerably
rich
in
historical
works
and
especially
the
memoirs
of
the
middle
ages
amidst
which
i
had
been
accustomed
to
pursue
the
composition
of
my
fictitious
narratives
in
other
words
it
was
chiefly
the
work
of
leisure
hours
in
edinburgh
not
of
quiet
mornings
in
the
country
in
consequence
of
trusting
to
a
memory
strongly
tenacious
certainly
but
not
less
capricious
in
its
efforts
i
have
to
confess
on
this
occasion
more
violations
of
accuracy
in
historical
details
than
can
perhaps
be
alleged
against
others
of
my
novels
in
truth
often
as
i
have
been
complimented
on
the
strength
of
my
memory
i
have
through
life
been
entitled
to
adopt
old
beattie
of
meikledale
answer
to
his
parish
minister
when
eulogising
him
with
respect
to
the
same
faculty
no
doctor
said
the
honest
i
have
no
command
of
my
memory
it
only
retains
what
happens
to
hit
my
fancy
and
like
enough
sir
if
you
were
to
preach
to
me
for
a
couple
of
hours
on
end
i
might
be
unable
at
the
close
of
the
discourse
to
remember
one
word
of
it
perhaps
there
are
few
men
whose
memory
serves
them
with
equal
fidelity
as
to
many
different
classes
of
subjects
but
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
while
mine
has
rarely
failed
me
as
to
any
snatch
of
verse
or
trait
of
character
that
had
once
interested
my
fancy
it
has
generally
been
a
frail
support
not
only
as
to
names
and
dates
and
other
minute
technicalities
of
history
but
as
to
many
more
important
things
i
hope
this
apology
will
suffice
for
one
mistake
which
has
been
pointed
out
to
me
by
the
descendant
of
one
of
the
persons
introduced
in
this
story
and
who
complains
with
reason
that
i
have
made
a
peasant
deputy
of
the
ancestor
of
a
distinguished
and
noble
family
none
of
whom
ever
declined
from
the
high
rank
to
which
as
far
as
my
pen
trenched
on
it
i
now
beg
leave
to
restore
them
the
name
of
the
person
who
figures
as
deputy
of
soleure
in
these
pages
was
always
it
seems
as
it
is
now
that
of
a
patrician
house
i
am
reminded
by
the
same
correspondent
of
another
slip
probably
of
less
consequence
the
emperor
of
the
days
my
novel
refers
to
though
the
representative
of
that
leopold
who
fell
in
the
great
battle
of
sempach
never
set
up
any
pretensions
against
the
liberties
of
the
gallant
swiss
but
on
the
contrary
treated
with
uniform
prudence
and
forbearance
such
of
that
nation
as
had
established
their
independence
and
with
wise
as
well
as
generous
kindness
others
who
still
continued
to
acknowledge
fealty
to
the
imperial
crown
errors
of
this
sort
however
trivial
ought
never
in
my
opinion
to
be
pointed
out
to
an
author
without
meeting
with
a
candid
and
respectful
acknowledgment
with
regard
to
a
general
subject
of
great
curiosity
and
interest
in
the
eyes
at
least
of
all
antiquarian
students
upon
which
i
have
touched
at
some
length
in
this
narrative
i
mean
the
tribunals
of
westphalia
a
name
so
awful
in
men
ears
during
many
centuries
and
which
through
the
genius
of
goethe
has
again
been
revived
in
public
fancy
with
a
full
share
of
its
ancient
terrors
i
am
bound
to
state
my
opinion
that
a
wholly
new
and
most
important
light
has
been
thrown
upon
this
matter
since
anne
of
geierstein
first
appeared
by
the
elaborate
researches
of
my
ingenious
friend
francis
palgrave
whose
containing
the
passages
i
allude
to
have
been
kindly
forwarded
to
me
and
whose
complete
work
will
be
before
the
public
ere
this
introduction
can
pass
through
the
press
in
germany
says
this
very
learned
writer
there
existed
a
singular
jurisdiction
which
claimed
a
descent
from
the
pagan
policy
and
mystic
ritual
of
the
earliest
we
learn
from
the
historians
of
saxony
that
the
feld
gericht
or
free
field
court
of
corbey
was
in
pagan
times
under
the
supremacy
of
the
priests
of
the
eresburgh
the
temple
which
contained
the
irminsule
or
pillar
of
irmin
after
the
conversion
of
the
people
the
possessions
of
the
temple
were
conferred
by
louis
the
pious
upon
the
abbey
which
arose
upon
its
site
the
court
was
composed
of
sixteen
persons
who
held
their
offices
for
life
the
senior
member
presided
as
the
gerefa
or
graff
the
junior
performed
the
humbler
duties
of
or
summoner
the
remaining
fourteen
acted
as
the
echevins
and
by
them
all
judgments
were
pronounced
or
declared
when
any
one
of
these
died
a
new
member
was
elected
by
the
priests
from
amongst
the
septs
or
families
inhabiting
the
gau
or
district
and
who
included
all
the
hereditary
occupants
of
the
soil
afterwards
the
selection
was
made
by
the
monks
but
always
with
the
assent
of
the
graff
and
of
the
the
seat
of
judgment
the
king
seat
or
was
always
established
on
the
greensward
and
we
collect
from
the
context
that
the
tribunal
was
also
raised
or
appointed
in
the
common
fields
of
the
gau
for
the
purpose
of
deciding
disputes
relating
to
the
land
within
its
precinct
such
a
seat
was
a
plot
sixteen
feet
in
length
and
sixteen
feet
in
breadth
and
when
the
ground
was
first
consecrated
the
frohner
dug
a
grave
in
the
centre
into
which
each
of
the
free
echevins
threw
a
handful
of
ashes
a
coal
and
a
tile
if
any
doubt
arose
whether
a
place
of
judgment
had
been
duly
hallowed
the
judges
sought
for
the
tokens
if
they
were
not
found
then
all
the
judgments
which
had
been
given
became
null
and
void
it
was
also
of
the
very
essence
of
the
court
that
it
should
be
held
beneath
the
sky
and
by
the
light
of
the
sun
all
the
ancient
teutonic
judicial
assemblies
were
held
in
the
open
air
but
some
relics
of
solar
worship
may
perhaps
be
traced
in
the
usage
and
in
the
language
of
this
tribunal
the
forms
adopted
in
the
free
field
court
also
betray
a
singular
affinity
to
the
doctrines
of
the
british
bards
respecting
their
gorseddau
or
conventions
which
were
held
in
the
open
air
in
the
eye
of
the
light
and
in
face
of
the
sun
when
a
criminal
was
to
be
judged
or
a
cause
to
be
decided
the
graff
and
the
free
echevins
assembled
around
the
and
the
having
proclaimed
silence
opened
the
proceedings
by
reciting
the
following
rhymes
sir
graff
with
permission
i
beg
you
to
say
according
to
law
and
without
delay
if
i
your
knave
who
judgment
crave
with
your
good
grace
upon
the
king
seat
this
seat
may
place
to
this
address
the
graff
replied
while
the
sun
shines
with
even
light
upon
masters
and
knaves
i
shall
declare
the
law
of
might
according
to
right
place
the
king
seat
true
and
square
let
even
measure
for
justice
sake
be
given
in
sight
of
god
and
man
that
the
plaintiff
his
complaint
may
make
and
the
defendant
answer
if
he
can
in
conformity
to
this
permission
the
placed
the
seat
of
judgment
in
the
middle
of
the
plot
and
then
he
spake
for
the
second
time
sir
graff
master
brave
i
remind
you
of
your
honour
here
and
moreover
that
i
am
your
knave
tell
me
therefore
for
law
sincere
if
these
are
even
and
sure
fit
for
the
rich
and
fit
for
the
poor
both
to
measure
land
and
condition
tell
me
as
you
would
eschew
perdition
and
so
speaking
he
laid
the
on
the
ground
the
graff
then
began
to
try
the
measure
by
placing
his
right
foot
against
the
wand
and
he
was
followed
by
the
other
free
echevins
in
rank
and
order
according
to
seniority
the
length
of
the
being
thus
proved
the
frohner
spake
for
the
third
time
sir
graff
i
ask
by
permission
if
i
with
your
may
mete
openly
and
without
displeasure
here
the
king
free
judgment
seat
and
the
graff
replied
i
permit
right
and
i
forbid
wrong
under
the
pains
and
penalties
that
to
the
old
known
laws
belong
now
was
the
time
of
measuring
the
mystic
plot
it
was
measured
by
the
along
and
athwart
and
when
the
dimensions
were
found
to
be
true
the
graff
placed
himself
in
the
seat
of
judgment
and
gave
the
charge
to
the
assembled
free
echevins
warning
them
to
pronounce
judgment
according
to
right
and
justice
on
this
day
with
common
consent
and
under
the
clear
firmament
a
free
field
court
is
established
here
in
the
open
eye
of
day
enter
soberly
ye
who
may
the
seat
in
its
place
is
pight
the
is
found
to
be
right
declare
your
judgments
without
delay
and
let
the
doom
be
truly
given
whilst
yet
the
sun
shines
bright
in
heaven
judgment
was
given
by
the
free
echevins
according
to
plurality
of
voices
after
observing
that
the
author
of
anne
of
geierstein
had
by
what
he
calls
a
very
excusable
poetical
licence
transferred
something
of
these
judicial
rhymes
from
the
free
field
court
of
the
abbey
of
corbey
to
the
free
vehmic
tribunals
of
westphalia
palgrave
proceeds
to
correct
many
vulgar
errors
in
which
the
novel
he
remarks
on
no
doubt
had
shared
with
respect
to
the
actual
constitution
of
those
courts
the
protocols
of
their
proceedings
he
says
do
not
altogether
realise
the
popular
idea
of
their
terrors
and
tyranny
it
may
be
allowed
to
me
to
question
whether
the
mere
protocols
of
such
tribunals
are
quite
enough
to
annul
all
the
import
of
tradition
respecting
them
but
in
the
following
details
there
is
no
doubt
much
that
will
instruct
the
antiquary
as
well
as
amuse
the
popular
reader
the
court
says
palgrave
was
held
with
known
and
notorious
publicity
beneath
the
of
light
and
the
sentences
though
speedy
and
severe
were
founded
upon
a
regular
system
of
established
jurisprudence
not
so
strange
even
to
england
as
it
may
at
first
sight
appear
westphalia
according
to
its
ancient
constitution
was
divided
into
districts
called
each
of
which
usually
contained
one
and
sometimes
many
vehmic
tribunals
whose
boundaries
were
accurately
defined
the
right
of
the
or
lord
was
of
a
feudal
nature
and
could
be
transferred
by
the
ordinary
modes
of
alienation
and
if
the
lord
did
not
choose
to
act
in
his
own
person
he
nominated
a
to
execute
the
office
in
his
stead
the
court
itself
was
composed
of
scabini
or
echevins
nominated
by
the
graff
and
who
were
divided
into
two
classes
the
ordinary
and
the
or
who
were
admitted
under
a
strict
and
singular
bond
of
secrecy
the
initiation
of
these
the
participators
in
all
the
mysteries
of
the
tribunal
could
only
take
place
upon
the
earth
or
within
the
limits
of
the
ancient
duchy
of
westphalia
bareheaded
and
ungirt
the
candidate
is
conducted
before
the
dread
tribunal
he
is
interrogated
as
to
his
qualifications
or
rather
as
to
the
absence
of
any
disqualification
he
must
be
free
born
a
teuton
and
clear
of
any
accusation
cognisable
by
the
tribunal
of
which
he
is
to
become
a
if
the
answers
are
satisfactory
he
then
takes
the
oath
swearing
by
the
holy
law
that
he
will
conceal
the
secrets
of
the
holy
vehme
from
wife
and
child
from
father
and
mother
from
sister
and
brother
from
fire
and
water
from
every
creature
upon
which
the
sun
shines
or
upon
which
the
rain
falls
from
every
being
between
earth
and
heaven
another
clause
relates
to
his
active
duties
he
further
swears
that
he
will
forth
to
the
tribunal
all
crimes
or
offences
which
fall
beneath
the
secret
ban
of
the
emperor
which
he
knows
to
be
true
or
which
he
has
heard
from
trustworthy
report
and
that
he
will
not
forbear
to
do
so
for
love
nor
for
loathing
for
gold
nor
for
silver
nor
precious
this
oath
being
imposed
upon
him
the
new
freischopff
was
then
intrusted
with
the
secrets
of
the
vehmic
tribunal
he
received
the
password
by
which
he
was
to
know
his
fellows
and
the
grip
or
sign
by
which
they
recognised
each
other
in
silence
and
he
was
warned
of
the
terrible
punishment
awaiting
the
perjured
if
he
discloses
the
secrets
of
the
court
he
is
to
expect
that
he
will
be
suddenly
seized
by
the
ministers
of
vengeance
his
eyes
are
bound
he
is
cast
down
on
the
soil
his
tongue
is
torn
out
through
the
back
of
his
neck
and
he
is
then
to
be
hanged
seven
times
higher
than
any
other
criminal
and
whether
restrained
by
the
fear
of
punishment
or
by
the
stronger
ties
of
mystery
no
instance
was
ever
known
of
any
violation
of
the
secrets
of
the
tribunal
thus
connected
by
an
invisible
bond
the
members
of
the
became
extremely
numerous
in
the
fourteenth
century
the
league
contained
upwards
of
one
hundred
thousand
members
persons
of
every
rank
sought
to
be
associated
to
this
powerful
community
and
to
participate
in
the
immunities
which
the
brethren
possessed
princes
were
eager
to
allow
their
ministers
to
become
the
members
of
this
mysterious
and
holy
alliance
and
the
cities
of
the
empire
were
equally
anxious
to
enrol
their
magistrates
in
the
vehmic
union
the
supreme
government
of
the
vehmic
tribunals
was
vested
in
the
great
or
general
chapter
composed
of
the
freegraves
and
all
the
other
initiated
members
high
and
low
over
this
assembly
the
emperor
might
preside
in
person
but
more
usually
by
his
deputy
the
stadtholder
of
the
ancient
duchy
of
westphalia
an
office
which
after
the
fall
of
henry
the
lion
duke
of
brunswick
was
annexed
to
the
archbishopric
of
cologne
before
the
general
chapter
all
the
members
were
liable
to
account
for
their
acts
and
it
appears
that
the
reported
the
proceedings
which
had
taken
place
within
their
jurisdictions
in
the
course
of
the
year
unworthy
members
were
expelled
or
sustained
a
severer
punishment
statutes
or
as
they
were
called
were
here
enacted
for
the
regulation
of
the
courts
and
the
amendment
of
any
abuses
and
new
and
unforeseen
cases
for
which
the
existing
laws
did
not
provide
a
remedy
received
their
determination
in
the
vehmic
parliament
as
the
echevins
were
of
two
classes
uninitiated
and
initiated
so
the
vehmic
courts
had
also
a
twofold
character
the
was
an
open
court
or
folkmoot
but
the
acht
was
the
secret
tribunal
the
first
was
held
three
times
in
each
year
according
to
the
ancient
teutonic
usage
it
usually
assembled
on
tuesday
anciently
called
or
as
well
as
or
the
first
open
or
working
day
after
the
two
great
weekly
festivals
of
and
here
all
the
householders
of
the
district
whether
free
or
bond
attended
as
suitors
the
exercised
a
civil
jurisdiction
and
in
this
folkmoot
appeared
any
complainant
or
appellant
who
sought
to
obtain
the
aid
of
the
vehmic
tribunal
in
those
cases
when
it
did
not
possess
that
summary
jurisdiction
from
which
it
has
obtained
such
fearful
celebrity
here
also
the
suitors
of
the
district
made
presentments
or
as
they
are
termed
of
any
offences
committed
within
their
knowledge
and
which
were
to
be
punished
by
the
graff
and
echevins
the
criminal
jurisdiction
of
the
vehmic
tribunal
took
the
widest
range
the
could
punish
mere
slander
and
contumely
any
violation
of
the
ten
commandments
was
to
be
restrained
by
the
echevins
secret
crimes
not
to
be
proved
by
the
ordinary
testimony
of
witnesses
such
as
magic
witchcraft
and
poison
were
particularly
to
be
restrained
by
the
vehmic
judges
and
they
sometimes
designated
their
jurisdiction
as
comprehending
every
offence
against
the
honour
of
man
or
the
precepts
of
religion
such
a
definition
if
definition
it
can
be
called
evidently
allowed
them
to
bring
every
action
of
which
an
individual
might
complain
within
the
scope
of
their
tribunals
the
forcible
usurpation
of
land
became
an
offence
against
the
and
if
the
property
of
an
humble
individual
was
occupied
by
the
proud
burghers
of
the
hanse
the
power
of
the
defendants
might
afford
a
reasonable
excuse
for
the
interference
of
the
vehmic
power
the
echevins
as
conservators
of
the
ban
of
the
empire
were
bound
to
make
constant
circuits
within
their
districts
by
night
and
by
day
if
they
could
apprehend
a
thief
a
murderer
or
the
perpetrator
of
any
other
heinous
crime
in
possession
of
the
or
in
the
very
act
or
if
his
own
mouth
confessed
the
deed
they
hung
him
upon
the
next
tree
but
to
render
this
execution
legal
the
following
requisites
were
necessary
fresh
suit
or
the
apprehension
and
execution
of
the
offender
before
daybreak
or
nightfall
the
visible
evidence
of
the
crime
and
lastly
that
three
echevins
at
least
should
seize
the
offender
testify
against
him
and
judge
of
the
recent
deed
if
without
any
certain
accuser
and
without
the
indication
of
crime
an
individual
was
strongly
and
vehemently
suspected
or
when
the
nature
of
the
offence
was
such
as
that
its
proof
could
only
rest
upon
opinion
and
presumption
the
offender
then
became
subject
to
what
the
german
jurists
term
the
inquisitorial
proceeding
it
became
the
duty
of
the
echevin
to
denounce
the
or
manifest
evil
fame
to
the
secret
tribunal
if
the
echevins
and
the
freygraff
were
satisfied
with
the
presentment
either
from
their
own
knowledge
or
from
the
information
of
their
compeer
the
offender
was
said
to
be
his
life
was
forfeited
and
wherever
he
was
found
by
the
brethren
of
the
tribunal
they
executed
him
without
the
slightest
delay
or
mercy
an
offender
who
had
escaped
from
the
echevins
was
liable
to
the
same
punishment
and
such
also
was
the
doom
of
the
party
who
after
having
been
summoned
pursuant
to
an
appeal
preferred
in
open
court
made
default
in
appearing
but
one
of
the
was
in
no
respect
liable
to
the
summary
process
or
to
the
inquisitorial
proceeding
unless
he
had
revealed
the
secrets
of
the
court
he
was
presumed
to
be
a
true
man
and
if
accused
upon
vehement
suspicion
or
the
same
presumption
or
evil
repute
which
was
fatal
to
the
uninitiated
might
be
entirely
rebutted
by
the
compurgatory
oath
of
the
free
echevin
if
a
party
accused
by
appeal
did
not
shun
investigation
he
appeared
in
the
open
court
and
defended
himself
according
to
the
ordinary
rules
of
law
if
he
absconded
or
if
the
evidence
or
presumptions
were
against
him
the
accusation
then
came
before
the
judges
of
the
secret
court
who
pronounced
the
doom
the
accusatorial
process
as
it
was
termed
was
also
in
many
cases
brought
in
the
first
instance
before
the
acht
proceeding
upon
the
examination
of
witnesses
it
possessed
no
peculiar
character
and
its
forms
were
those
of
the
ordinary
courts
of
justice
it
was
only
in
this
manner
that
one
of
the
or
witan
could
be
tried
and
the
privilege
of
being
exempted
from
the
summary
process
or
from
the
effects
of
the
appears
to
have
been
one
of
the
reasons
which
induced
so
many
of
those
who
did
not
tread
the
earth
to
seek
to
be
included
in
the
vehmic
bond
there
was
no
mystery
in
the
assembly
of
the
heimliche
acht
under
the
oak
or
under
the
the
judges
assembled
in
broad
daylight
and
before
the
eye
of
heaven
but
the
tribunal
derived
its
name
from
the
precautions
which
were
taken
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
any
disclosure
of
its
proceedings
which
might
enable
the
offender
to
escape
the
vengeance
of
the
vehme
hence
the
fearful
oath
of
secrecy
which
bound
the
echevins
and
if
any
stranger
was
found
present
in
the
court
the
unlucky
intruder
instantly
forfeited
his
life
as
a
punishment
for
his
temerity
if
the
presentment
or
denunciation
did
chance
to
become
known
to
the
offender
the
law
allowed
him
a
right
of
appeal
but
the
permission
was
of
very
little
utility
it
was
a
profitless
boon
for
the
vehmic
judges
always
laboured
to
conceal
the
judgment
from
the
hapless
criminal
who
seldom
was
aware
of

charlemagne
according
to
the
traditions
of
westphalia
was
the
founder
of
the
vehmic
tribunal
and
it
was
supposed
that
he
instituted
the
court
for
the
purpose
of
coercing
the
saxons
ever
ready
to
relapse
into
the
idolatry
from
which
they
had
been
reclaimed
not
by
persuasion
but
by
the
sword
this
opinion
however
is
not
confirmed
either
by
documentary
evidence
or
by
contemporary
historians
and
if
we
examine
the
proceedings
of
the
vehmic
tribunal
we
shall
see
that
in
principle
it
differs
in
no
essential
character
from
the
summary
jurisdiction
exercised
in
the
townships
and
hundreds
of
england
amongst
us
the
thief
or
the
robber
was
equally
liable
to
summary
punishment
if
apprehended
by
the
men
of
the
township
and
the
same
rules
disqualified
them
from
proceeding
to
summary
execution
an
english
outlaw
was
exactly
in
the
situation
of
him
who
had
escaped
from
the
hands
of
the
echevins
or
who
had
failed
to
appear
before
the
vehmic
court
he
was
condemned
unheard
nor
was
he
confronted
with
his
accusers
the
inquisitorial
proceedings
as
they
are
termed
by
the
german
jurists
are
identical
with
our
ancient
presentments
presumptions
are
substituted
for
proofs
and
general
opinion
holds
the
place
of
a
responsible
accuser
he
who
was
untrue
to
all
the
people
in
the
saxon
age
or
liable
to
the
malecredence
of
the
inquest
at
a
subsequent
period
was
scarcely
more
fortunate
than
he
who
was
branded
as
by
the
vehmic
law
in
cases
of
open
delict
and
of
outlawry
there
was
substantially
no
difference
whatever
between
the
english
and
the
vehmic
proceedings
but
in
the
inquisitorial
process
the
delinquent
was
allowed
according
to
our
older
code
to
run
the
risk
of
the
ordeal
he
was
accused
by
or
before
the
hundred
or
the
thanes
of
the
wapentake
and
his
own
oath
cleared
him
if
a
true
man
but
he
the
iron
if
unable
to
avail
himself
of
the
credit
derived
from
a
good
and
fair
reputation
the
same
course
may
have
been
originally
adopted
in
westphalia
for
the
when
accused
could
exculpate
himself
by
his
compurgatory
oath
being
presumed
to
be
of
good
fame
and
it
is
therefore
probable
that
an
uninitiated
offender
standing
a
stage
lower
in
character
and
credibility
was
allowed
the
last
resort
of
the
ordeal
but
when
the
of
god
was
abolished
by
the
decrees
of
the
church
it
did
not
occur
to
the
vehmic
judges
to
put
the
offender
upon
his
second
trial
by
the
visne
which
now
forms
the
distinguishing
characteristic
of
the
english
law

he
was
at
once

and
mystic
forms
of
initiation
the
system
of
enigmatical
phrases
the
use
of

may
probably
be
ascribed
to
the
period
when
the
whole
system
was
united
to
the
worship
of
the
deities
of
vengeance
and
when
the

some
very
faint

the
mystery
had
long
been
dispersed
and
the
whole
system
passed
into
the
ordinary
machinery
of
the
law
as
to
the
vehmic
tribunals
it
is
acknowledged
that
in
a
truly
barbarous
age
and
country
their
proceedings
however
violent
were
not
without
utility
their
severe
and
secret
vengeance
often
deterred
the
rapacity
of
the
noble
robber
and
protected
the
humble
suppliant

extent
and
even
the
abuse
of
their
authority

in
some
measure
justified
in
an
empire

into
numerous
independent
jurisdictions
and
not
subjected
to
any
paramount
tribunal

to
administer
impartial
justice
to
the
oppressed
but
as
the
times
improved
the
vehmic
tribunals
degenerated

from
the
inferior
ranks

not

the

if

a
statement

myself
that

work
met
with
a
reception
of
more
than

cordiality
among

i
have
in

to
express
my
thanks

the

swiss

who
have
since

enriched
my
little
collection
of
armour
with
specimens
of
the
huge
weapon
that
sheared
the
lances
of
the
austrian
chivalry
at

was
employed
with
equal
success
on
the
bloody
days
of

the
ancient

i
have
in

way

not
less
than

from

many

thus
testified
their

approbation
of
these

they
are
not
the
less
interesting
that
gigantic

the

will
find
ample

of

that
important
period
when
chivalry
still
shone
with
a
setting
ray
soon
about
to
be
totally
obscured
in
some
countries
by
the
establishment
of
free
institutions
in
others
by
that
of
arbitrary
power
which
alike
rendered
useless
the
interference
of
those
redressers
of
wrongs
whose
only
warrant
of
authority
was
the
sword
amid
the
general
light
which
had
recently
shone
upon
europe
france
burgundy
and
italy
but
more
especially
austria
had
been
made
acquainted
with
the
character
of
a
people
of
whose
very
existence
they
had
before
been
scarcely
conscious
it
is
true
that
the
inhabitants
of
those
countries
which
lie
in
the
vicinity
of
the
alps
that
immense
barrier
were
not
ignorant
that
notwithstanding
their
rugged
and
desolate
appearance
the
secluded
valleys
which
winded
among
those
gigantic
mountains
nourished
a
race
of
hunters
and
shepherds
men
who
living
in
a
state
of
primeval
simplicity
compelled
from
the
soil
a
subsistence
gained
by
severe
labour
followed
the
chase
over
the
most
savage
precipices
and
through
the
darkest
pine
forests
or
drove
their
cattle
to
spots
which
afforded
them
a
scanty
pasturage
even
in
the
vicinage
of
eternal
snows
but
the
existence
of
such
a
people
or
rather
of
a
number
of
small
communities
who
followed
nearly
the
same
poor
and
hardy
course
of
life
had
seemed
to
the
rich
and
powerful
princes
in
the
neighbourhood
a
matter
of
as
little
consequence
as
it
is
to
the
stately
herds
which
repose
in
a
fertile
meadow
that
a
few
goats
find
their
scanty
food
among
the
rocks
which
overlook
their
rich
domain
but
wonder
and
attention
began
to
be
attracted
towards
these
mountaineers
about
the
middle
of
the
fourteenth
century
when
reports
were
spread
abroad
of
severe
contests
in
which
the
german
chivalry
endeavouring
to
suppress
insurrections
among
their
alpine
vassals
had
sustained
repeated
and
bloody
defeats
although
having
on
their
side
numbers
and
discipline
and
the
advantage
of
the
most
perfect
military
equipment
then
known
and
confided
in
great
was
the
wonder
that
cavalry
which
made
the
only
efficient
part
of
the
feudal
armies
of
these
ages
should
be
routed
by
men
on
foot
that
warriors
sheathed
in
complete
steel
should
be
overpowered
by
naked
peasants
who
wore
no
defensive
armour
and
were
irregularly
provided
with
pikes
halberts
and
clubs
for
the
purpose
of
attack
above
all
it
seemed
a
species
of
miracle
that
knights
and
nobles
of
the
highest
birth
should
be
defeated
by
mountaineers
and
shepherds
but
the
repeated
victories
of
the
swiss
at
laupen
sempach
and
on
other
less
distinguished
occasions
plainly
intimated
that
a
new
principle
of
civil
organisation
as
well
as
of
military
movements
had
arisen
amid
the
stormy
regions
of
helvetia
still
although
the
decisive
victories
which
obtained
liberty
for
the
swiss
cantons
as
well
as
the
spirit
of
resolution
and
wisdom
with
which
the
members
of
the
little
confederation
had
maintained
themselves
against
the
utmost
exertions
of
austria
had
spread
their
fame
abroad
through
all
the
neighbouring
countries
and
although
they
themselves
were
conscious
of
the
character
and
actual
power
which
repeated
victories
had
acquired
for
themselves
and
their
country
yet
down
to
the
middle
of
the
fifteenth
century
and
at
a
later
date
the
swiss
retained
in
a
great
measure
the
wisdom
moderation
and
simplicity
of
their
ancient
manners
so
much
so
that
those
who
were
intrusted
with
the
command
of
the
troops
of
the
republic
in
battle
were
wont
to
resume
the
shepherd
staff
when
they
laid
down
the
truncheon
and
like
the
roman
dictators
to
retire
to
complete
equality
with
their
from
the
eminence
of
military
command
to
which
their
talents
and
the
call
of
their
country
had
raised
them
it
is
then
in
the
forest
cantons
of
switzerland
in
the
autumn
of
while
these
districts
were
in
the
rude
and
simple
state
we
have
described
that
our
tale
opens
two
travellers
one
considerably
past
the
prime
of
life
the
other
probably
two
or
three
and
twenty
years
old
had
passed
the
night
at
the
little
town
of
lucerne
the
capital
of
the
swiss
state
of
the
same
name
and
beautifully
situated
on
the
lake
of
the
four
cantons
their
dress
and
character
seemed
those
of
merchants
of
a
higher
class
and
while
they
themselves
journeyed
on
foot
the
character
of
the
country
rendering
that
by
far
the
most
easy
mode
of
pursuing
their
route
a
young
peasant
lad
from
the
italian
side
of
the
alps
followed
them
with
a
sumpter
mule
laden
apparently
with
men
wares
and
baggage
which
he
sometimes
mounted
but
more
frequently
led
by
the
bridle
the
travellers
were
uncommonly
men
and
seemed
connected
by
some
very
near
relationship
probably
that
of
father
and
son
for
at
the
little
inn
where
they
lodged
on
the
preceding
evening
the
great
deference
and
respect
paid
by
the
younger
to
the
elder
had
not
escaped
the
observation
of
the
natives
who
like
other
sequestered
beings
were
curious
in
proportion
to
the
limited
means
of
information
which
they
possessed
they
observed
also
that
the
merchants
under
pretence
of
haste
declined
opening
their
bales
or
proposing
traffic
to
the
inhabitants
of
lucerne
alleging
in
excuse
that
they
had
no
commodities
fitted
for
the
market
the
females
of
the
town
were
the
more
displeased
with
the
reserve
of
the
mercantile
travellers
because
they
were
given
to
understand
that
it
was
occasioned
by
the
wares
in
which
they
dealt
being
too
costly
to
find
customers
among
the
helvetian
mountains
for
it
had
transpired
by
means
of
their
attendant
that
the
strangers
had
visited
venice
and
had
there
made
many
purchases
of
rich
commodities
which
were
brought
from
india
and
egypt
to
that
celebrated
emporium
as
to
the
common
mart
of
the
western
world
and
thence
dispersed
into
all
quarters
of
europe
now
the
swiss
maidens
had
of
late
made
the
discovery
that
gauds
and
gems
were
fair
to
look
upon
and
though
without
the
hope
of
being
able
to
possess
themselves
of
such
ornaments
they
felt
a
natural
desire
to
review
and
handle
the
rich
stores
of
the
merchants
and
some
displeasure
at
being
prevented
from
doing
so
it
was
also
observed
that
though
the
strangers
were
sufficiently
courteous
in
their
demeanour
they
did
not
evince
that
studious
anxiety
to
please
displayed
by
the
travelling
pedlars
or
merchants
of
lombardy
or
savoy
by
whom
the
inhabitants
of
the
mountains
were
occasionally
visited
and
who
had
been
more
frequent
in
their
rounds
of
late
years
since
the
spoils
of
victory
had
invested
the
swiss
with
some
wealth
and
had
taught
many
of
them
new
wants
those
peripatetic
traders
were
civil
and
assiduous
as
their
calling
required
but
the
new
visitors
seemed
men
who
were
indifferent
to
traffic
or
at
least
to
such
slender
gains
as
could
be
gathered
in
switzerland
curiosity
was
further
excited
by
the
circumstance
that
they
spoke
to
each
other
in
a
language
which
was
certainly
neither
german
italian
nor
french
but
from
which
an
old
man
serving
in
the
cabaret
who
had
once
been
as
far
as
paris
supposed
they
might
be
english
a
people
of
whom
it
was
only
known
in
these
mountains
that
they
were
a
fierce
insular
race
at
war
with
the
french
for
many
years
and
a
large
body
of
whom
had
long
since
invaded
the
forest
cantons
and
sustained
such
a
defeat
in
the
valley
of
russwyl
as
was
well
remembered
by
the
men
of
lucerne
who
received
the
tale
from
their
fathers
the
lad
who
attended
the
strangers
was
soon
ascertained
to
be
a
youth
from
the
grisons
country
who
acted
as
their
guide
so
far
as
his
knowledge
of
the
mountains
permitted
he
said
they
designed
to
go
to
bâle
but
seemed
desirous
to
travel
by
circuitous
and
unfrequented
routes
the
circumstances
just
mentioned
increased
the
general
desire
to
know
more
of
the
travellers
and
of
their
merchandise
not
a
bale
however
was
unpacked
and
the
merchants
leaving
lucerne
next
morning
resumed
their
toilsome
journey
preferring
a
circuitous
route
and
bad
roads
through
the
peaceful
cantons
of
switzerland
to
encountering
the
exactions
and
rapine
of
the
robber
chivalry
of
germany
who
like
so
many
sovereigns
made
war
each
at
his
own
pleasure
and
levied
tolls
and
taxes
on
every
one
who
passed
their
domains
of
a
mile
breadth
with
all
the
insolence
of
petty
tyranny
for
several
hours
after
leaving
lucerne
the
journey
of
our
travellers
was
successfully
prosecuted
the
road
though
precipitous
and
difficult
was
rendered
interesting
by
those
splendid
phenomena
which
no
country
exhibits
in
a
more
astonishing
manner
than
the
mountains
of
switzerland
where
the
rocky
pass
the
verdant
valley
the
broad
lake
and
the
rushing
torrent
the
attributes
of
other
hills
as
well
as
these
are
interspersed
with
the
magnificent
and
yet
fearful
horrors
of
the
glaciers
a
feature
peculiar
to
themselves
it
was
not
an
age
in
which
the
beauties
or
grandeur
of
a
landscape
made
much
impression
either
on
the
minds
of
those
who
travelled
through
the
country
or
who
resided
in
it
to
the
latter
the
objects
however
dignified
were
familiar
and
associated
with
daily
habits
and
with
daily
toil
and
the
former
saw
perhaps
more
terror
than
beauty
in
the
wild
region
through
which
they
passed
and
were
rather
solicitous
to
get
safe
to
their
night
quarters
than
to
comment
on
the
grandeur
of
the
scenes
which
lay
between
them
and
their
place
of
rest
yet
our
merchants
as
they
proceeded
on
their
journey
could
not
help
being
strongly
impressed
by
the
character
of
the
scenery
around
them
their
road
lay
along
the
side
of
the
lake
at
times
level
and
close
on
its
very
margin
at
times
rising
to
a
great
height
on
the
side
of
the
mountain
and
winding
along
the
verge
of
precipices
which
sank
down
to
the
water
as
sharp
and
sheer
as
the
wall
of
a
castle
descending
upon
the
ditch
which
defends
it
at
other
times
it
traversed
spots
of
a
milder
character
delightful
green
slopes
and
lowly
retired
valleys
affording
both
pasturage
and
arable
ground
sometimes
watered
by
small
streams
which
winded
by
the
hamlet
of
wooden
huts
with
their
fantastic
little
church
and
steeple
meandered
round
the
orchard
and
the
mount
of
vines
and
murmuring
gently
as
they
flowed
found
a
quiet
passage
into
the
lake
that
stream
arthur
said
the
elder
traveller
as
with
one
consent
they
stopped
to
gaze
on
such
a
scene
as
i
have
described
resembles
the
life
of
a
good
and
a
happy
man
and
the
brook
which
hurries
itself
headlong
down
yon
distant
hill
marking
its
course
by
a
streak
of
white
foam
answered
arthur
what
does
that
resemble
that
of
a
brave
and
unfortunate
one
replied
his
father
the
torrent
for
me
said
arthur
a
headlong
course
which
no
human
force
can
oppose
and
then
let
it
be
as
brief
as
it
is
glorious
it
is
a
young
man
thought
replied
his
father
but
i
am
well
aware
that
it
is
so
rooted
in
thy
heart
that
nothing
but
the
rude
hand
of
adversity
can
pluck
it
up
as
yet
the
root
clings
fast
to
my
heart
strings
said
the
young
man
and
methinks
adversity
hand
hath
had
a
fair
grasp
of
it
you
speak
my
son
of
what
you
little
understand
said
his
father
know
that
till
the
middle
of
life
be
passed
men
scarce
distinguish
true
prosperity
from
adversity
or
rather
they
court
as
the
favours
of
fortune
what
they
should
more
justly
regard
as
the
marks
of
her
displeasure
look
at
yonder
mountain
which
wears
on
its
shaggy
brow
a
diadem
of
clouds
now
raised
and
now
depressed
while
the
sun
glances
upon
but
is
unable
to
dispel
it
a
child
might
believe
it
to
be
a
crown
of
glory
a
man
knows
it
to
be
the
signal
of
tempest
arthur
followed
the
direction
of
his
father
eye
to
the
dark
and
shadowy
eminence
of
mount
pilatus
is
the
mist
on
yonder
wild
mountain
so
ominous
then
asked
the
young
man
demand
of
antonio
said
his
father
he
will
tell
you
the
legend
the
young
merchant
addressed
himself
to
the
swiss
lad
who
acted
as
their
attendant
desiring
to
know
the
name
of
the
gloomy
height
which
in
that
quarter
seems
the
leviathan
of
the
huge
congregation
of
mountains
assembled
about
lucerne
the
lad
crossed
himself
devoutly
as
he
recounted
the
popular
legend
that
the
wicked
pontius
pilate
proconsul
of
judea
had
here
found
the
termination
of
his
impious
life
having
after
spending
years
in
the
recesses
of
that
mountain
which
bears
his
name
at
length
in
remorse
and
despair
rather
than
in
penitence
plunged
into
the
dismal
lake
which
occupies
the
summit
whether
water
refused
to
do
the
executioner
duty
upon
such
a
wretch
or
whether
his
body
being
drowned
his
vexed
spirit
continued
to
haunt
the
place
where
he
committed
suicide
antonio
did
not
pretend
to
explain
but
a
form
was
often
he
said
seen
to
emerge
from
the
gloomy
waters
and
go
through
the
action
of
one
washing
his
hands
and
when
he
did
so
dark
clouds
of
mist
gathered
first
round
the
bosom
of
the
infernal
lake
such
it
had
been
styled
of
old
and
then
wrapping
the
whole
upper
part
of
the
mountain
in
darkness
presaged
a
tempest
or
hurricane
which
was
sure
to
follow
in
a
short
space
he
added
that
the
evil
spirit
was
peculiarly
exasperated
at
the
audacity
of
such
strangers
as
ascended
the
mountain
to
gaze
at
his
place
of
punishment
and
that
in
consequence
the
magistrates
of
lucerne
had
prohibited
any
one
from
approaching
mount
pilatus
under
severe
penalties
antonio
once
more
crossed
himself
as
he
finished
his
legend
in
which
act
of
devotion
he
was
imitated
by
his
hearers
too
good
catholics
to
entertain
any
doubt
of
the
truth
of
the
story
how
the
accursed
heathen
scowls
upon
us
said
the
younger
of
the
merchants
while
the
cloud
darkened
and
seemed
to
settle
on
the
brow
of
mount
pilatus
retro
be
thou
defied
sinner
a
rising
wind
rather
heard
than
felt
seemed
to
groan
forth
in
the
tone
of
a
dying
lion
the
acceptance
of
the
suffering
spirit
to
the
rash
challenge
of
the
young
englishman
the
mountain
was
seen
to
send
down
its
rugged
sides
thick
wreaths
of
heaving
mist
which
rolling
through
the
rugged
chasms
that
seamed
the
grisly
hill
resembled
torrents
of
rushing
lava
pouring
down
from
a
volcano
the
ridgy
precipices
which
formed
the
sides
of
these
huge
ravines
showed
their
splintery
and
rugged
edges
over
the
vapour
as
if
dividing
from
each
other
the
descending
streams
of
mist
which
rolled
around
them
as
a
strong
contrast
to
this
gloomy
and
threatening
scene
the
more
distant
mountain
range
of
rigi
shone
brilliant
with
all
the
hues
of
an
autumnal
sun
while
the
travellers
watched
this
striking
and
varied
contrast
which
resembled
an
approaching
combat
betwixt
the
powers
of
light
and
darkness
their
guide
in
his
mixed
jargon
of
italian
and
german
exhorted
them
to
make
haste
on
their
journey
the
village
to
which
he
proposed
to
conduct
them
he
said
was
yet
distant
the
road
bad
and
difficult
to
find
and
if
the
evil
one
looking
to
mount
pilatus
and
crossing
himself
should
send
his
darkness
upon
the
valley
the
path
would
be
both
doubtful
and
dangerous
the
travellers
thus
admonished
gathered
the
capes
of
their
cloaks
close
round
their
throats
pulled
their
bonnets
resolvedly
over
their
brows
drew
the
buckle
of
the
broad
belts
which
fastened
their
mantles
and
each
with
a
mountain
staff
in
his
hand
well
shod
with
an
iron
spike
they
pursued
their
journey
with
unabated
strength
and
undaunted
spirit
with
every
step
the
scenes
around
them
appeared
to
change
each
mountain
as
if
its
firm
and
immutable
form
were
flexible
and
varying
altered
in
appearance
like
that
of
a
shadowy
apparition
as
the
position
of
the
strangers
relative
to
them
changed
with
their
motions
and
as
the
mist
which
continued
slowly
though
constantly
to
descend
influenced
the
rugged
aspect
of
the
hills
and
valleys
which
it
shrouded
with
its
vapoury
mantle
the
nature
of
their
progress
too
never
direct
but
winding
by
a
narrow
path
along
the
sinuosities
of
the
valley
and
making
many
a
circuit
round
precipices
and
other
obstacles
which
it
was
impossible
to
surmount
added
to
the
wild
variety
of
a
journey
in
which
at
last
the
travellers
totally
lost
any
vague
idea
which
they
had
previously
entertained
concerning
the
direction
in
which
the
road
led
them
i
would
said
the
elder
we
had
that
mystical
needle
which
mariners
talk
of
that
points
ever
to
the
north
and
enables
them
to
keep
their
way
on
the
waters
when
there
is
neither
cape
nor
headland
sun
moon
nor
stars
nor
any
mark
in
heaven
or
earth
to
tell
them
how
to
steer
it
would
scarce
avail
us
among
these
mountains
answered
the
youth
for
though
that
wonderful
needle
may
keep
its
point
to
the
northern
when
it
is
on
a
flat
surface
like
the
sea
it
is
not
to
be
thought
it
would
do
so
when
these
huge
mountains
arise
like
walls
betwixt
the
steel
and
the
object
of
its
sympathy
i
fear
me
replied
the
father
we
shall
find
our
guide
who
has
been
growing
hourly
more
stupid
since
he
left
his
own
valley
as
useless
as
you
suppose
the
compass
would
be
among
the
hills
of
this
wild
canst
tell
my
boy
said
he
addressing
antonio
in
bad
italian
if
we
be
in
the
road
we
purposed
if
it
please
antonio
said
the
guide
who
was
obviously
too
much
confused
to
answer
the
question
directly
and
that
water
half
covered
with
mist
which
glimmers
through
the
fog
at
the
foot
of
this
huge
black
precipice
is
it
still
a
part
of
the
lake
of
lucerne
or
have
we
lighted
upon
another
since
we
ascended
that
last
hill
antonio
could
only
answer
that
they
ought
to
be
on
the
lake
of
lucerne
still
and
that
he
hoped
that
what
they
saw
below
them
was
only
a
winding
branch
of
the
same
sheet
of
water
but
he
could
say
nothing
with
certainty
dog
of
an
italian
exclaimed
the
younger
traveller
thou
deservest
to
have
thy
bones
broken
for
undertaking
a
charge
which
thou
art
as
incapable
to
perform
as
thou
art
to
guide
us
to
heaven
peace
arthur
said
his
father
if
you
frighten
the
lad
he
runs
off
and
we
lose
the
small
advantage
we
might
have
by
his
knowledge
if
you
use
your
baton
he
rewards
you
with
the
stab
of
a
knife
for
such
is
the
humour
of
a
revengeful
lombard
either
way
you
are
marred
instead
of
hark
thee
hither
my
boy
he
continued
in
his
indifferent
italian
be
not
afraid
of
that
hot
youngster
whom
i
will
not
permit
to
injure
thee
but
tell
me
if
thou
canst
the
names
of
the
villages
by
which
we
are
to
make
our
journey
the
gentle
mode
in
which
the
elder
traveller
spoke
reassured
the
lad
who
had
been
somewhat
alarmed
at
the
harsh
tone
and
menacing
expressions
of
his
younger
companion
and
he
poured
forth
in
his
patois
a
flood
of
names
in
which
the
german
guttural
sounds
were
strangely
intermixed
with
the
soft
accents
of
the
italian
but
which
carried
to
the
hearer
no
intelligible
information
concerning
the
object
of
his
question
so
that
at
length
he
was
forced
to
conclude
even
lead
on
in
our
lady
name
or
in
antonio
if
you
like
it
better
we
shall
but
lose
time
i
see
in
trying
to
understand
each
other
they
moved
on
as
before
with
this
difference
that
the
guide
leading
the
mule
now
went
first
and
was
followed
by
the
other
two
whose
motions
he
had
formerly
directed
by
calling
to
them
from
behind
the
clouds
meantime
became
thicker
and
thicker
and
the
mist
which
had
at
first
been
a
thin
vapour
began
now
to
descend
in
the
form
of
a
small
thick
rain
which
gathered
like
dew
upon
the
capotes
of
the
travellers
distant
rustling
and
groaning
sounds
were
heard
among
the
remote
mountains
similar
to
those
by
which
the
evil
spirit
of
mount
pilatus
had
seemed
to
announce
the
storm
the
boy
again
pressed
his
companions
to
advance
but
at
the
same
time
threw
impediments
in
the
way
of
their
doing
so
by
the
slowness
and
indecision
which
he
showed
in
leading
them
on
having
proceeded
in
this
manner
for
three
or
four
miles
which
uncertainty
rendered
doubly
tedious
the
travellers
were
at
length
engaged
in
a
narrow
path
running
along
the
verge
of
a
precipice
beneath
was
water
but
of
what
description
they
could
not
ascertain
the
wind
indeed
which
began
to
be
felt
in
sudden
gusts
sometimes
swept
aside
the
mist
so
completely
as
to
show
the
waves
glimmering
below
but
whether
they
were
those
of
the
same
lake
on
which
their
morning
journey
had
commenced
whether
it
was
another
and
separate
sheet
of
water
of
a
similar
character
or
whether
it
was
a
river
or
large
brook
the
view
afforded
was
too
indistinct
to
determine
thus
far
was
certain
that
they
were
not
on
the
shores
of
the
lake
of
lucerne
where
it
displays
its
usual
expanse
of
waters
for
the
same
hurricane
gusts
which
showed
them
water
in
the
bottom
of
the
glen
gave
them
a
transient
view
of
the
opposite
side
at
what
exact
distance
they
could
not
well
discern
but
near
enough
to
show
tall
abrupt
rocks
and
shaggy
here
united
in
groups
and
there
singly
anchored
among
the
cliffs
which
overhung
the
water
this
was
a
more
distinct
landscape
than
the
farther
side
of
the
lake
would
have
offered
had
they
been
on
the
right
road
hitherto
the
path
though
steep
and
rugged
was
plainly
enough
indicated
and
showed
traces
of
having
been
used
both
by
riders
and
foot
passengers
but
suddenly
as
antonio
with
the
loaded
mule
had
reached
a
projecting
eminence
around
the
peak
of
which
the
path
made
a
sharp
turn
he
stopped
short
with
his
usual
exclamation
addressed
to
his
patron
saint
it
appeared
to
arthur
that
the
mule
shared
the
terrors
of
the
guide
for
it
started
back
put
forwards
its
fore
feet
separate
from
each
other
and
seemed
by
the
attitude
which
it
assumed
to
intimate
a
determination
to
resist
every
proposal
to
advance
at
the
same
time
expressing
horror
and
fear
at
the
prospect
which
lay
before
it
arthur
pressed
forward
not
only
from
curiosity
but
that
he
might
if
possible
bear
the
brunt
of
any
danger
before
his
father
came
up
to
share
it
in
less
time
than
we
have
taken
to
tell
the
story
the
young
man
stood
beside
antonio
and
the
mule
upon
a
platform
of
rock
on
which
the
road
seemed
absolutely
to
terminate
and
from
the
farther
side
of
which
a
precipice
sank
sheer
down
to
what
depth
the
mist
did
not
permit
him
to
discern
but
certainly
uninterrupted
for
more
than
three
hundred
feet
the
blank
expression
which
overcast
the
visage
of
the
younger
traveller
and
traces
of
which
might
be
discerned
in
the
physiognomy
of
the
beast
of
burden
announced
alarm
and
mortification
at
this
unexpected
and
as
it
seemed
insurmountable
obstacle
nor
did
the
looks
of
the
father
who
presently
after
came
up
to
the
same
spot
convey
either
hope
or
comfort
he
stood
with
the
others
gazing
on
the
misty
gulf
beneath
them
and
looking
all
around
but
in
vain
for
some
continuation
of
the
path
which
certainly
had
never
been
originally
designed
to
terminate
in
this
summary
manner
as
they
stood
uncertain
what
to
do
next
the
son
in
vain
attempting
to
discover
some
mode
of
passing
onward
and
the
father
about
to
propose
that
they
should
return
by
the
road
which
had
brought
them
hither
a
loud
howl
of
the
wind
more
wild
than
they
had
yet
heard
swept
down
the
valley
all
being
aware
of
the
danger
of
being
hurled
from
the
precarious
station
which
they
occupied
snatched
at
bushes
and
rocks
by
which
to
secure
themselves
and
even
the
poor
mule
seemed
to
steady
itself
in
order
to
withstand
the
approaching
hurricane
the
gust
came
with
such
unexpected
fury
that
it
appeared
to
the
travellers
to
shake
the
very
rock
on
which
they
stood
and
would
have
swept
them
from
its
surface
like
so
many
dry
leaves
had
it
not
been
for
the
momentary
precautions
which
they
had
taken
for
their
safety
but
as
the
wind
rushed
down
the
glen
it
completely
removed
for
the
space
of
three
or
four
minutes
the
veil
of
mist
which
former
gusts
had
only
served
to
agitate
or
discompose
and
showed
them
the
nature
and
cause
of
the
interruption
which
they
had
met
with
so
unexpectedly
the
rapid
but
correct
eye
of
arthur
was
then
able
to
ascertain
that
the
path
after
leaving
the
platform
of
rock
on
which
they
stood
had
originally
passed
upwards
in
the
same
direction
along
the
edge
of
a
steep
bank
of
earth
which
had
then
formed
the
upper
covering
of
a
stratum
of
precipitous
rocks
but
it
had
chanced
in
some
of
the
convulsions
of
nature
which
take
place
in
those
wild
regions
where
she
works
upon
a
scale
so
formidable
that
the
earth
had
made
a
slip
or
almost
a
precipitous
descent
from
the
rock
and
been
hurled
downwards
with
the
path
which
was
traced
along
the
top
and
with
bushes
trees
or
whatever
grew
upon
it
into
the
channel
of
the
stream
for
such
they
could
now
discern
the
water
beneath
them
to
be
and
not
a
lake
or
an
arm
of
a
lake
as
they
had
hitherto
supposed
the
immediate
cause
of
this
phenomenon
might
probably
have
been
an
earthquake
not
unfrequent
in
that
country
the
bank
of
earth
now
a
confused
mass
of
ruins
inverted
in
its
fall
showed
some
trees
growing
in
a
horizontal
position
and
others
which
having
pitched
on
their
heads
in
their
descent
were
at
once
inverted
and
shattered
to
pieces
and
lay
a
sport
to
the
streams
of
the
river
which
they
had
heretofore
covered
with
gloomy
shadow
the
gaunt
precipice
which
remained
behind
like
the
skeleton
of
some
huge
monster
divested
of
its
flesh
formed
the
wall
of
a
fearful
abyss
resembling
the
face
of
a
newly
wrought
quarry
more
dismal
of
aspect
from
the
rawness
of
its
recent
formation
and
from
its
being
as
yet
uncovered
with
any
of
the
vegetation
with
which
nature
speedily
mantles
over
the
bare
surface
even
of
her
sternest
crags
and
precipices
besides
remarking
these
appearances
which
tended
to
show
that
this
interruption
of
the
road
had
been
of
recent
occurrence
arthur
was
able
to
observe
on
the
farther
side
of
the
river
higher
up
the
valley
and
rising
out
of
the
pine
forests
interspersed
with
rocks
a
square
building
of
considerable
height
like
the
ruins
of
a
gothic
tower
he
pointed
out
this
remarkable
object
to
antonio
and
demanded
if
he
knew
it
justly
conjecturing
that
from
the
peculiarity
of
the
site
it
was
a
landmark
not
easily
to
be
forgotten
by
any
who
had
seen
it
before
accordingly
it
was
gladly
and
promptly
recognised
by
the
lad
who
called
out
cheerfully
that
the
place
was
geierstein
that
is
as
he
explained
it
the
rock
of
the
vultures
he
knew
it
he
said
by
the
old
tower
as
well
as
by
a
huge
pinnacle
of
rock
which
arose
near
it
almost
in
the
form
of
a
steeple
to
the
top
of
which
the
one
of
the
largest
birds
of
prey
known
to
exist
had
in
former
days
transported
the
child
of
an
ancient
lord
of
the
castle
he
proceeded
to
recount
the
vow
which
was
made
by
the
knight
of
geierstein
to
our
lady
of
einsiedlen
and
while
he
spoke
the
castle
rocks
woods
and
precipices
again
faded
in
mist
but
as
he
concluded
his
wonderful
narrative
with
the
miracle
which
restored
the
infant
again
to
its
father
arms
he
cried
out
suddenly
look
to
yourselves
the
storm
the
storm
it
came
accordingly
and
sweeping
the
mist
before
it
again
bestowed
on
the
travellers
a
view
of
the
horrors
around
them
ay
quoth
antonio
triumphantly
as
the
gust
abated
old
pontius
loves
little
to
hear
of
our
lady
of
einsiedlen
but
she
will
keep
her
own
with
him
ave
maria
that
tower
said
the
young
traveller
seems
uninhabited
i
can
descry
no
smoke
and
the
battlement
appears
ruinous
it
has
not
been
inhabited
for
many
a
day
answered
the
guide
but
i
would
i
were
at
it
for
all
that
honest
arnold
biederman
the
landamman
chief
magistrate
of
the
canton
of
unterwalden
dwells
near
and
i
warrant
you
distressed
strangers
will
not
want
the
best
that
cupboard
and
cellar
can
find
them
wherever
he
holds
rule
i
have
heard
of
him
said
the
elder
traveller
whom
antonio
had
been
taught
to
call
seignor
philipson
a
good
and
hospitable
man
and
one
who
enjoys
deserved
weight
with
his
countrymen
you
have
spoken
him
right
seignor
answered
the
guide
and
i
would
we
could
reach
his
house
where
you
should
be
sure
of
hospitable
treatment
and
a
good
direction
for
your
next
day
journey
but
how
we
are
to
get
to
the
vulture
castle
unless
we
had
wings
like
the
vulture
is
a
question
hard
to
answer
arthur
replied
by
a
daring
proposal
which
the
reader
will
find
in
the
next
chapter
footnote
see
editor
notes
at
the
end
of
the
volume
wherever
a
similar
reference
occurs
the
reader
will
understand
that
the
same
direction
applies
chapter
ii
away
with
me
the
clouds
grow
thicker
there
now
lean
on
me
place
your
foot
here
here
take
this
staff
and
cling
a
moment
to
that
shrub
now
give
me
your
hand
the
chalet
will
be
gained
within
an
hour
after
surveying
the
desolate
scene
as
accurately
as
the
stormy
state
of
the
atmosphere
would
permit
the
younger
of
the
travellers
observed
in
any
other
country
i
should
say
the
tempest
begins
to
abate
but
what
to
expect
in
this
land
of
desolation
it
were
rash
to
decide
if
the
apostate
spirit
of
pilate
be
actually
on
the
blast
these
lingering
and
more
distant
howls
seem
to
intimate
that
he
is
returning
to
his
place
of
punishment
the
pathway
has
sunk
with
the
ground
on
which
it
was
traced
i
can
see
part
of
it
lying
down
in
the
abyss
marking
as
with
a
streak
of
clay
yonder
mass
of
earth
and
stone
but
i
think
it
possible
with
your
permission
my
father
that
i
could
still
scramble
forward
along
the
edge
of
the
precipice
till
i
come
in
sight
of
the
habitation
which
the
lad
tells
us
of
if
there
be
actually
such
a
one
there
must
be
an
access
to
it
somewhere
and
if
i
can
not
find
the
path
out
i
can
at
least
make
a
signal
to
those
who
dwell
near
the
vulture
nest
yonder
and
obtain
some
friendly
guidance
i
can
not
consent
to
your
incurring
such
a
risk
said
his
father
let
the
lad
go
forward
if
he
can
and
will
he
is
and
i
will
reward
him
richly
but
antonio
declined
the
proposal
absolutely
and
decidedly
i
am
he
said
but
i
am
no
and
i
have
no
wings
to
transport
me
from
cliff
to
cliff
like
a
raven
gold
is
not
worth
life
and
god
forbid
said
seignor
philipson
that
i
should
tempt
thee
to
weigh
them
against
each
other
go
on
then
my
son
i
follow
thee
under
your
favour
dearest
sir
no
replied
the
young
man
it
is
enough
to
endanger
the
life
of
one
and
mine
far
the
most
worthless
should
by
all
the
rules
of
wisdom
as
well
as
nature
be
put
first
in
hazard
no
arthur
replied
his
father
in
a
determined
voice
no
my
son
i
have
survived
much
but
i
will
not
survive
thee
i
fear
not
for
the
issue
father
if
you
permit
me
to
go
alone
but
i
can
not
dare
not
undertake
a
task
so
perilous
if
you
persist
in
attempting
to
share
it
with
no
better
aid
than
mine
while
i
endeavoured
to
make
a
new
advance
i
should
be
ever
looking
back
to
see
how
you
might
attain
the
station
which
i
was
about
to
leave
and
bethink
you
dearest
father
that
if
i
fall
i
fall
an
unregarded
thing
of
as
little
moment
as
the
stone
or
tree
which
has
toppled
headlong
down
before
me
but
you
should
your
foot
slip
or
your
hand
fail
bethink
you
what
and
how
much
must
needs
fall
with
you
thou
art
right
my
child
said
the
father
i
still
have
that
which
binds
me
to
life
even
though
i
were
to
lose
in
thee
all
that
is
dear
to
our
lady
and
our
lady
knight
bless
thee
and
prosper
thee
my
child
thy
foot
is
young
thy
hand
is
strong
thou
hast
not
climbed
plynlimmon
in
vain
be
bold
but
be
wary
remember
there
is
a
man
who
failing
thee
has
but
one
act
of
duty
to
bind
him
to
the
earth
and
that
discharged
will
soon
follow
thee
the
young
man
accordingly
prepared
for
his
journey
and
stripping
himself
of
his
cumbrous
cloak
showed
his
limbs
in
a
jerkin
of
grey
cloth
which
sat
close
to
his
person
the
resolution
gave
way
when
his
son
turned
round
to
bid
him
farewell
he
recalled
his
permission
and
in
a
peremptory
tone
forbade
him
to
proceed
but
without
listening
to
the
prohibition
arthur
had
commenced
his
perilous
adventure
descending
from
the
platform
on
which
he
stood
by
the
boughs
of
an
old
which
thrust
itself
out
of
the
cleft
of
a
rock
the
youth
was
enabled
to
gain
though
at
great
risk
a
narrow
ledge
the
very
brink
of
the
precipice
by
creeping
along
which
he
hoped
to
pass
on
till
he
made
himself
heard
or
seen
from
the
habitation
of
whose
existence
the
guide
had
informed
him
his
situation
as
he
pursued
this
bold
purpose
appeared
so
precarious
that
even
the
hired
attendant
hardly
dared
to
draw
breath
as
he
gazed
on
him
the
ledge
which
supported
him
seemed
to
grow
so
narrow
as
he
passed
along
it
as
to
become
altogether
invisible
while
sometimes
with
his
face
to
the
precipice
sometimes
looking
forward
sometimes
glancing
his
eyes
upward
but
never
venturing
to
cast
a
look
below
lest
his
brain
should
grow
giddy
at
a
sight
so
appalling
he
wound
his
way
onward
to
his
father
and
the
attendant
who
beheld
his
progress
it
was
less
that
of
a
man
advancing
in
the
ordinary
manner
and
resting
by
aught
connected
with
the
firm
earth
than
that
of
an
insect
crawling
along
the
face
of
a
perpendicular
wall
of
whose
progressive
movement
we
are
indeed
sensible
but
can
not
perceive
the
means
of
its
support
and
bitterly
most
bitterly
did
the
miserable
parent
now
lament
that
he
had
not
persisted
in
his
purpose
to
encounter
the
baffling
and
even
perilous
measure
of
retracing
his
steps
to
the
habitation
of
the
preceding
night
he
should
then
at
least
have
partaken
the
fate
of
the
son
of
his
love
meanwhile
the
young
man
spirits
were
strongly
braced
for
the
performance
of
his
perilous
task
he
laid
a
powerful
restraint
on
his
imagination
which
in
general
was
sufficiently
active
and
refused
to
listen
even
for
an
instant
to
any
of
the
horrible
insinuations
by
which
fancy
augments
actual
danger
he
endeavoured
manfully
to
reduce
all
around
him
to
the
scale
of
right
reason
as
the
best
support
of
true
courage
this
ledge
of
rock
he
urged
to
himself
is
but
narrow
yet
it
has
breadth
enough
to
support
me
these
cliffs
and
crevices
in
the
surface
are
small
and
distant
but
the
one
affords
as
secure
a
to
my
feet
the
other
as
available
a
grasp
to
my
hands
as
if
i
stood
on
a
platform
of
a
cubit
broad
and
rested
my
arm
on
a
balustrade
of
marble
my
safety
therefore
depends
on
myself
if
i
move
with
decision
step
firmly
and
hold
fast
what
signifies
how
near
i
am
to
the
mouth
of
an
abyss
thus
estimating
the
extent
of
his
danger
by
the
measure
of
sound
sense
and
reality
and
supported
by
some
degree
of
practice
in
such
exercise
the
brave
youth
went
forward
on
his
awful
journey
step
by
step
winning
his
way
with
a
caution
and
fortitude
and
presence
of
mind
which
alone
could
have
saved
him
from
instant
destruction
at
length
he
gained
a
point
where
a
projecting
rock
formed
the
angle
of
the
precipice
so
far
as
it
had
been
visible
to
him
from
the
platform
this
therefore
was
the
critical
point
of
his
undertaking
but
it
was
also
the
most
perilous
part
of
it
the
rock
projected
more
than
six
feet
forward
over
the
torrent
which
he
heard
raging
at
the
depth
of
a
hundred
yards
beneath
with
a
noise
like
subterranean
thunder
he
examined
the
spot
with
the
utmost
care
and
was
led
by
the
existence
of
shrubs
grass
and
even
stunted
trees
to
believe
that
this
rock
marked
the
farthest
extent
of
the
slip
or
slide
of
earth
and
that
could
he
but
turn
round
the
angle
of
which
it
was
the
termination
he
might
hope
to
attain
the
continuation
of
the
path
which
had
been
so
strangely
interrupted
by
this
convulsion
of
nature
but
the
crag
jutted
out
so
much
as
to
afford
no
possibility
of
passing
either
under
or
around
it
and
as
it
rose
several
feet
above
the
position
which
arthur
had
attained
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
climb
over
it
this
was
however
the
course
which
he
chose
as
the
only
mode
of
surmounting
what
he
hoped
might
prove
the
last
obstacle
to
his
voyage
of
discovery
a
projecting
tree
afforded
him
the
means
of
raising
and
swinging
himself
up
to
the
top
of
the
crag
but
he
had
scarcely
planted
himself
on
it
had
scarcely
a
moment
to
congratulate
himself
on
seeing
amid
a
wild
chaos
of
cliffs
and
wood
the
gloomy
ruins
of
geierstein
with
smoke
arising
and
indicating
something
like
a
human
habitation
beside
them
when
to
his
extreme
terror
he
felt
the
huge
cliff
on
which
he
stood
tremble
stoop
slowly
forward
and
gradually
sink
from
its
position
projecting
as
it
was
and
shaken
as
its
equilibrium
had
been
by
the
recent
earthquake
it
lay
now
so
insecurely
poised
that
its
balance
was
entirely
destroyed
even
by
the
addition
of
the
young
man
weight
aroused
by
the
imminence
of
the
danger
arthur
by
an
instinctive
attempt
at
drew
cautiously
back
from
the
falling
crag
into
the
tree
by
which
he
had
ascended
and
turned
his
head
back
as
if
to
watch
the
descent
of
the
fatal
rock
from
which
he
had
just
retreated
it
tottered
for
two
or
three
seconds
as
if
uncertain
which
way
to
fall
and
had
it
taken
a
sidelong
direction
must
have
dashed
the
adventurer
from
his
place
of
refuge
or
borne
both
the
tree
and
him
headlong
down
into
the
river
after
a
moment
of
horrible
uncertainty
the
power
of
gravitation
determined
a
direct
and
forward
descent
down
went
the
huge
fragment
which
must
have
weighed
at
least
twenty
tons
rending
and
splintering
in
its
precipitate
course
the
trees
and
bushes
which
it
encountered
and
settling
at
length
in
the
channel
of
the
torrent
with
a
din
equal
to
the
discharge
of
a
hundred
pieces
of
artillery
the
sound
was
from
bank
to
bank
from
precipice
to
precipice
with
emulative
thunders
nor
was
the
tumult
silent
till
it
rose
into
the
region
of
eternal
snows
which
equally
insensible
to
terrestrial
sounds
and
unfavourable
to
animal
life
heard
the
roar
in
their
majestic
solitude
but
suffered
it
to
die
away
without
a
responsive
voice
what
in
the
meanwhile
were
the
thoughts
of
the
distracted
father
who
saw
the
ponderous
rock
descend
but
could
not
mark
whether
his
only
son
had
borne
it
company
in
its
dreadful
fall
his
first
impulse
was
to
rush
forward
along
the
face
of
the
precipice
which
he
had
seen
arthur
so
lately
traverse
and
when
the
lad
antonio
withheld
him
by
throwing
his
arms
around
him
he
turned
on
the
guide
with
the
fury
of
a
bear
which
had
been
robbed
of
her
cubs
unhand
me
base
peasant
he
exclaimed
or
thou
diest
on
the
spot
alas
said
the
poor
boy
dropping
on
his
knees
before
him
i
too
have
a
father
the
appeal
went
to
the
heart
of
the
traveller
who
instantly
let
the
lad
go
and
holding
up
his
hands
and
lifting
his
eyes
towards
heaven
said
in
accents
of
the
deepest
agony
mingled
with
devout
resignation
voluntas
tua
he
was
my
last
and
loveliest
and
best
beloved
and
most
worthy
of
my
love
and
yonder
he
added
yonder
over
the
glen
soar
the
birds
of
prey
who
are
to
feast
on
his
young
but
i
will
see
him
once
more
exclaimed
the
miserable
parent
as
the
huge
carrion
vulture
floated
past
him
on
the
thick
air
i
will
see
my
arthur
once
more
ere
the
wolf
and
the
eagle
mangle
him
i
will
see
all
of
him
that
earth
still
holds
detain
me
not
but
abide
here
and
watch
me
as
i
advance
if
i
fall
as
is
most
likely
i
charge
you
to
take
the
sealed
papers
which
you
will
find
in
the
valise
and
carry
them
to
the
person
to
whom
they
are
addressed
with
the
least
possible
delay
there
is
money
enough
in
the
purse
to
bury
me
with
my
poor
boy
and
to
cause
masses
be
said
for
our
souls
and
yet
leave
you
a
rich
recompense
for
your
journey
the
honest
swiss
lad
obtuse
in
his
understanding
but
kind
and
faithful
in
his
disposition
blubbered
as
his
employer
spoke
and
afraid
to
offer
further
remonstrance
or
opposition
saw
his
temporary
master
prepare
himself
to
traverse
the
same
fatal
precipice
over
the
verge
of
which
his
son
had
seemed
to
pass
to
the
fate
which
with
all
the
wildness
of
a
parent
anguish
his
father
was
hastening
to
share
suddenly
there
was
heard
from
beyond
the
fatal
angle
from
which
the
mass
of
stone
had
been
displaced
by
arthur
rash
ascent
the
loud
hoarse
sound
of
one
of
those
huge
horns
made
out
of
the
spoils
of
the
urus
or
wild
bull
of
switzerland
which
in
ancient
times
announced
the
terrors
of
the
charge
of
these
mountaineers
and
indeed
served
them
in
war
instead
of
all
musical
instruments
hold
sir
hold
exclaimed
the
grison
yonder
is
a
signal
from
geierstein
some
one
will
presently
come
to
our
assistance
and
show
us
the
safer
way
to
seek
for
your
and
look
you
at
yon
green
bush
that
is
glimmering
through
the
mist
antonio
preserve
me
as
i
see
a
white
cloth
displayed
there
it
is
just
beyond
the
point
where
the
rock
fell
the
father
endeavoured
to
fix
his
eyes
on
the
spot
but
they
filled
so
fast
with
tears
that
they
could
not
discern
the
object
which
the
guide
pointed
it
is
all
in
vain
he
said
dashing
the
tears
from
his
eyes
i
shall
never
see
more
of
him
than
his
lifeless
remains
you
will
you
will
see
him
in
life
said
the
grison
antonio
wills
it
so
see
the
white
cloth
waves
again
some
remnant
of
his
garments
said
the
despairing
father
some
wretched
memorial
of
his
no
my
eyes
see
it
not
i
have
beheld
the
fall
of
my
house
would
that
the
vultures
of
these
crags
had
rather
torn
them
from
their
sockets
yet
look
again
said
the
swiss
the
cloth
hangs
not
loose
upon
a
bough
i
can
see
that
it
is
raised
on
the
end
of
a
staff
and
is
distinctly
waved
to
and
fro
your
son
makes
a
signal
that
he
is
safe
and
if
it
be
so
said
the
traveller
clasping
his
hands
together
blessed
be
the
eyes
that
see
it
and
the
tongue
that
tells
it
if
we
find
my
son
and
find
him
alive
this
day
shall
be
a
lucky
one
for
thee
too
nay
answered
the
lad
i
only
ask
that
you
will
abide
still
and
act
by
counsel
and
i
will
hold
myself
quit
for
my
services
only
it
is
not
creditable
to
an
honest
lad
to
have
people
lose
themselves
by
their
own
wilfulness
for
the
blame
after
all
is
sure
to
fall
upon
the
guide
as
if
he
could
prevent
old
pontius
from
shaking
the
mist
from
his
brow
or
banks
of
earth
from
slipping
down
into
the
valley
at
a
time
or
young
harebrained
gallants
from
walking
upon
precipices
as
narrow
as
the
edge
of
a
knife
or
madmen
whose
grey
hairs
might
make
them
wiser
from
drawing
daggers
like
bravos
in
lombardy
thus
the
guide
ran
on
and
in
that
vein
he
might
have
long
continued
for
seignor
philipson
heard
him
not
each
throb
of
his
pulse
each
thought
of
his
heart
was
directed
towards
the
object
which
the
lad
referred
to
as
a
signal
of
his
son
safety
he
became
at
length
satisfied
that
the
signal
was
actually
waved
by
a
human
hand
and
as
eager
in
the
glow
of
reviving
hope
as
he
had
of
late
been
under
the
influence
of
desperate
grief
he
again
prepared
for
the
attempt
of
advancing
towards
his
son
and
assisting
him
if
possible
in
regaining
a
place
of
safety
but
the
entreaties
and
reiterated
assurances
of
his
guide
induced
him
to
pause
are
you
fit
he
said
to
go
on
the
crag
can
you
repeat
your
credo
and
ave
without
missing
or
misplacing
a
word
for
without
that
our
old
men
say
your
neck
had
you
a
score
of
them
would
be
in
is
your
eye
clear
and
your
feet
firm
i
trow
the
one
streams
like
a
fountain
and
the
other
shakes
like
the
aspen
which
overhangs
it
rest
here
till
those
arrive
who
are
far
more
able
to
give
your
son
help
than
either
you
or
i
are
i
judge
by
the
fashion
of
his
blowing
that
yonder
is
the
horn
of
the
goodman
of
geierstein
arnold
biederman
he
hath
seen
your
son
danger
and
is
even
now
providing
for
his
safety
and
ours
there
are
cases
in
which
the
aid
of
one
stranger
well
acquainted
with
the
country
is
worth
that
of
three
brothers
who
know
not
the
crags
but
if
yonder
horn
really
sounded
a
signal
said
the
traveller
how
chanced
it
that
my
son
replied
not
and
if
he
did
so
as
is
most
likely
he
did
rejoined
the
grison
how
should
we
have
heard
him
the
bugle
of
uri
itself
sounded
amid
these
horrible
dins
of
water
and
tempest
like
the
reed
of
a
shepherd
boy
and
how
think
you
we
should
hear
the
holloa
of
a
man
yet
methinks
said
seignor
philipson
i
do
hear
something
amid
this
roar
of
elements
which
is
like
a
human
voice
but
it
is
not
arthur
i
wot
well
no
answered
the
grison
that
is
a
woman
voice
the
maidens
will
converse
with
each
other
in
that
manner
from
cliff
to
cliff
through
storm
and
tempest
were
there
a
mile
between
now
heaven
be
praised
for
this
providential
relief
said
seignor
philipson
i
trust
we
shall
yet
see
this
dreadful
day
safely
ended
i
will
holloa
in
answer
he
attempted
to
do
so
but
inexperienced
in
the
art
of
making
himself
heard
in
such
a
country
he
pitched
his
voice
in
the
same
key
with
that
of
the
roar
of
wave
and
wind
so
that
even
at
twenty
yards
from
the
place
where
he
was
speaking
it
must
have
been
totally
indistinguishable
from
that
of
the
elemental
war
around
them
the
lad
smiled
at
his
patron
ineffectual
attempts
and
then
raised
his
voice
himself
in
a
high
wild
and
prolonged
scream
which
while
produced
with
apparently
much
less
effort
than
that
of
the
englishman
was
nevertheless
a
distinct
sound
separated
from
others
by
the
key
to
which
it
was
pitched
and
was
probably
audible
to
a
very
considerable
distance
it
was
presently
answered
by
distant
cries
of
the
same
nature
which
gradually
approached
the
platform
bringing
renovated
hope
to
the
anxious
traveller
if
the
distress
of
the
father
rendered
his
condition
an
object
of
deep
compassion
that
of
the
son
at
the
same
moment
was
sufficiently
perilous
we
have
already
stated
that
arthur
philipson
had
commenced
his
precarious
journey
along
the
precipice
with
all
the
coolness
resolution
and
unshaken
determination
of
mind
which
was
most
essential
to
a
task
where
all
must
depend
upon
firmness
of
nerve
but
the
formidable
accident
which
checked
his
onward
progress
was
of
a
character
so
dreadful
as
made
him
feel
all
the
bitterness
of
a
death
instant
horrible
and
as
it
seemed
inevitable
the
solid
rock
had
trembled
and
rent
beneath
his
footsteps
and
although
by
an
effort
rather
mechanical
than
voluntary
he
had
withdrawn
himself
from
the
instant
ruin
attending
its
descent
he
felt
as
if
the
better
part
of
him
his
firmness
of
mind
and
strength
of
body
had
been
rent
away
with
the
descending
rock
as
it
fell
thundering
with
clouds
of
dust
and
smoke
into
the
torrents
and
whirlpools
of
the
vexed
gulf
beneath
in
fact
the
seaman
swept
from
the
deck
of
a
wrecked
vessel
drenched
in
the
waves
and
battered
against
the
rocks
on
the
shore
does
not
differ
more
from
the
same
mariner
when
at
the
commencement
of
the
gale
he
stood
upon
the
deck
of
his
favourite
ship
proud
of
her
strength
and
his
own
dexterity
than
arthur
when
commencing
his
journey
from
the
same
arthur
while
clinging
to
the
decayed
trunk
of
an
old
tree
from
which
suspended
between
heaven
and
earth
he
saw
the
fall
of
the
crag
which
he
had
so
nearly
accompanied
the
effects
of
his
terror
indeed
were
physical
as
well
as
moral
for
a
thousand
colours
played
before
his
eyes
he
was
attacked
by
a
sick
dizziness
and
deprived
at
once
of
the
obedience
of
those
limbs
which
had
hitherto
served
him
so
admirably
his
arms
and
hands
as
if
no
longer
at
his
own
command
now
clung
to
the
branches
of
the
tree
with
a
tenacity
over
which
he
seemed
to
possess
no
power
and
now
trembled
in
a
state
of
such
complete
nervous
relaxation
as
led
him
to
fear
that
they
were
becoming
unable
to
support
him
longer
in
his
position
an
incident
in
itself
trifling
added
to
the
distress
occasioned
by
this
alienation
of
his
powers
all
living
things
in
the
neighbourhood
had
as
might
be
supposed
been
startled
by
the
tremendous
fall
to
which
his
progress
had
given
occasion
flights
of
owls
bats
and
other
birds
of
darkness
compelled
to
betake
themselves
to
the
air
had
lost
no
time
in
returning
into
their
bowers
of
ivy
or
the
harbour
afforded
them
by
the
rifts
and
holes
of
the
neighbouring
rocks
one
of
this
flight
chanced
to
be
a
or
alpine
vulture
a
bird
larger
and
more
voracious
than
the
eagle
himself
and
which
arthur
had
not
been
accustomed
to
see
or
at
least
to
look
upon
closely
with
the
instinct
of
most
birds
of
prey
it
is
the
custom
of
this
creature
when
gorged
with
food
to
assume
some
station
of
inaccessible
security
and
there
remain
stationary
and
motionless
for
days
together
till
the
work
of
digestion
has
been
accomplished
and
activity
returns
with
the
pressure
of
appetite
disturbed
from
such
a
state
of
repose
one
of
these
terrific
birds
had
risen
from
the
ravine
to
which
the
species
gives
its
name
and
having
circled
unwillingly
round
with
a
ghastly
scream
and
a
flagging
wing
it
had
sunk
down
upon
the
pinnacle
of
a
crag
not
four
yards
from
the
tree
in
which
arthur
held
his
precarious
station
although
still
in
some
degree
stupefied
by
torpor
it
seemed
encouraged
by
the
motionless
state
of
the
young
man
to
suppose
him
dead
or
dying
and
sat
there
and
gazed
at
him
without
displaying
any
of
that
apprehension
which
the
fiercest
animals
usually
entertain
from
the
vicinity
of
man
as
arthur
endeavouring
to
shake
off
the
incapacitating
effects
of
his
panic
fear
raised
his
eyes
to
look
gradually
and
cautiously
around
he
encountered
those
of
the
voracious
and
obscene
bird
whose
head
and
neck
denuded
of
feathers
her
eyes
surrounded
by
an
iris
of
an
colour
and
a
position
more
horizontal
than
erect
distinguished
her
as
much
from
the
noble
carriage
and
graceful
proportions
of
the
eagle
as
those
of
the
lion
place
him
in
the
ranks
of
creation
above
the
gaunt
ravenous
grisly
yet
dastard
wolf
as
if
arrested
by
a
charm
the
eyes
of
young
philipson
remained
bent
on
this
and
bird
without
his
having
the
power
to
remove
them
the
apprehension
of
dangers
ideal
as
well
as
real
weighed
upon
his
weakened
mind
disabled
as
it
was
by
the
circumstances
of
his
situation
the
near
approach
of
a
creature
not
more
loathsome
to
the
human
race
than
averse
to
come
within
their
reach
seemed
as
ominous
as
it
was
unusual
why
did
it
gaze
on
him
with
such
glaring
earnestness
projecting
its
disgusting
form
as
if
presently
to
alight
upon
his
person
the
foul
bird
was
she
the
demon
of
the
place
to
which
her
name
referred
and
did
she
come
to
exult
that
an
intruder
on
her
haunts
seemed
involved
amid
their
perils
with
little
hope
or
chance
of
deliverance
or
was
it
a
native
vulture
of
the
rocks
whose
sagacity
foresaw
that
the
rash
traveller
was
soon
destined
to
become
its
victim
could
the
creature
whose
senses
are
said
to
be
so
acute
argue
from
circumstances
the
approaching
death
and
wait
like
a
raven
or
hooded
crow
by
a
dying
sheep
for
the
earliest
opportunity
to
commence
her
ravenous
banquet
was
he
doomed
to
feel
its
beak
and
talons
before
his
heart
blood
should
cease
to
beat
had
he
already
lost
the
dignity
of
humanity
the
awe
which
the
being
formed
in
the
image
of
his
maker
inspires
into
all
inferior
creatures
apprehensions
so
painful
served
more
than
all
that
reason
could
suggest
to
renew
in
some
degree
the
elasticity
of
the
young
mind
by
waving
his
handkerchief
using
however
the
greatest
precaution
in
his
movements
he
succeeded
in
scaring
the
vulture
from
his
vicinity
it
rose
from
its
screaming
harshly
and
dolefully
and
sailed
on
its
expanded
pinions
to
seek
a
place
of
more
undisturbed
repose
while
the
adventurous
traveller
felt
a
sensible
pleasure
at
being
relieved
of
its
disgusting
presence
with
more
collected
ideas
the
young
man
who
could
obtain
from
his
position
a
partial
view
of
the
platform
he
had
left
endeavoured
to
testify
his
safety
to
his
father
by
displaying
as
high
as
he
could
the
banner
by
which
he
had
chased
off
the
vulture
like
them
too
he
heard
but
at
a
less
distance
the
burst
of
the
great
swiss
horn
which
seemed
to
announce
some
near
succour
he
replied
by
shouting
and
waving
his
flag
to
direct
assistance
to
the
spot
where
it
was
so
much
required
and
recalling
his
faculties
which
had
almost
deserted
him
he
laboured
mentally
to
recover
hope
and
with
hope
the
means
and
motive
for
exertion
a
faithful
catholic
he
eagerly
recommended
himself
in
prayer
to
our
lady
of
einsiedlen
and
making
vows
of
propitiation
besought
her
intercession
that
he
might
be
delivered
from
his
dreadful
condition
or
gracious
lady
he
concluded
his
orison
if
it
is
my
doom
to
lose
my
life
like
a
hunted
fox
amidst
this
savage
wilderness
of
tottering
crags
restore
at
least
my
natural
sense
of
patience
and
courage
and
let
not
one
who
has
lived
like
a
man
though
a
sinful
one
meet
death
like
a
timid
hare
having
devoutly
recommended
himself
to
that
protectress
of
whom
the
legends
of
the
catholic
church
form
a
picture
so
amiable
arthur
though
every
nerve
still
shook
with
his
late
agitation
and
his
heart
throbbed
with
a
violence
that
threatened
to
suffocate
him
turned
his
thoughts
and
observation
to
the
means
of
effecting
his
escape
but
as
he
looked
around
him
he
became
more
and
more
sensible
how
much
he
was
enervated
by
the
bodily
injuries
and
the
mental
agony
which
he
had
sustained
during
his
late
peril
he
could
not
by
any
effort
of
which
he
was
capable
fix
his
giddy
and
bewildered
eyes
on
the
scene
around
him
they
seemed
to
reel
till
the
landscape
danced
along
with
them
and
a
motley
chaos
of
thickets
and
tall
cliffs
which
interposed
between
him
and
the
ruinous
castle
of
geierstein
mixed
and
whirled
round
in
such
confusion
that
nothing
save
the
consciousness
that
such
an
idea
was
the
suggestion
of
partial
insanity
prevented
him
from
throwing
himself
from
the
tree
as
if
to
join
the
wild
dance
to
which
his
disturbed
brain
had
given
motion
heaven
be
my
protection
said
the
unfortunate
young
man
closing
his
eyes
in
hopes
by
abstracting
himself
from
the
terrors
of
his
situation
to
compose
his
too
active
imagination
my
senses
are
abandoning
me
he
became
still
more
convinced
that
this
was
the
case
when
a
female
voice
in
a
but
eminently
musical
accent
was
heard
at
no
great
distance
as
if
calling
to
him
he
opened
his
eyes
once
more
raised
his
head
and
looked
towards
the
place
whence
the
sounds
seemed
to
come
though
far
from
being
certain
that
they
existed
saving
in
his
own
disordered
imagination
the
vision
which
appeared
had
almost
confirmed
him
in
the
opinion
that
his
mind
was
unsettled
and
his
senses
in
no
state
to
serve
him
accurately
upon
the
very
summit
of
a
pyramidical
rock
that
rose
out
of
the
depth
of
the
valley
was
seen
a
female
figure
so
obscured
by
mist
that
only
the
outline
could
be
traced
the
form
reflected
against
the
sky
appeared
rather
the
undefined
lineaments
of
a
spirit
than
of
a
mortal
maiden
for
her
person
seemed
as
light
and
scarcely
more
opaque
than
the
thin
cloud
that
surrounded
her
pedestal
arthur
first
belief
was
that
the
virgin
had
heard
his
vows
and
had
descended
in
person
to
his
rescue
and
he
was
about
to
recite
his
ave
maria
when
the
voice
again
called
to
him
with
the
singular
shrill
modulation
of
the
mountain
halloo
by
which
the
natives
of
the
alps
can
hold
conference
with
each
other
from
one
mountain
ridge
to
another
across
ravines
of
great
depth
and
width
while
he
debated
how
to
address
this
unexpected
apparition
it
disappeared
from
the
point
which
it
at
first
occupied
and
presently
after
became
again
visible
perched
on
the
cliff
out
of
which
projected
the
tree
in
which
arthur
had
taken
refuge
her
personal
appearance
as
well
as
her
dress
made
it
then
apparent
that
she
was
a
maiden
of
these
mountains
familiar
with
their
dangerous
paths
he
saw
that
a
beautiful
young
woman
stood
before
him
who
regarded
him
with
a
mixture
of
pity
and
wonder
stranger
she
at
length
said
who
are
you
and
whence
come
you
i
am
a
stranger
maiden
as
you
justly
term
me
answered
the
young
man
raising
himself
as
well
as
he
could
i
left
lucerne
this
morning
with
my
father
and
a
guide
i
parted
with
them
not
three
furlongs
from
hence
may
it
please
you
gentle
maiden
to
warn
them
of
my
safety
for
i
know
my
father
will
be
in
despair
upon
my
account
willingly
said
the
maiden
but
i
think
my
uncle
or
some
one
of
my
kinsmen
must
have
already
found
them
and
will
prove
faithful
guides
can
i
not
aid
you
are
you
wounded
are
you
hurt
we
were
alarmed
by
the
fall
of
a
rock
ay
and
yonder
it
lies
a
mass
of
no
ordinary
size
as
the
swiss
maiden
spoke
thus
she
approached
so
close
to
the
verge
of
the
precipice
and
looked
with
such
indifference
into
the
gulf
that
the
sympathy
which
connects
the
actor
and
spectator
upon
such
occasions
brought
back
the
sickness
and
vertigo
from
which
arthur
had
just
recovered
and
he
sank
back
into
his
former
more
recumbent
posture
with
something
like
a
faint
groan
you
are
then
ill
said
the
maiden
who
observed
him
turn
pale
where
and
what
is
the
harm
you
have
received
none
gentle
maiden
saving
some
bruises
of
little
import
but
my
head
turns
and
my
heart
grows
sick
when
i
see
you
so
near
the
verge
of
the
cliff
is
that
all
replied
the
swiss
maiden
know
stranger
that
i
do
not
stand
on
my
uncle
hearth
with
more
security
than
i
have
stood
upon
precipices
compared
to
which
this
is
a
child
leap
you
too
stranger
if
as
i
judge
from
the
traces
you
have
come
along
the
edge
of
the
precipice
which
the
hath
laid
bare
ought
to
be
far
beyond
such
weakness
since
surely
you
must
be
well
entitled
to
call
yourself
a
cragsman
i
might
have
called
myself
so
half
an
hour
since
answered
arthur
but
i
think
i
shall
hardly
venture
to
assume
the
name
in
future
be
not
downcast
said
his
kind
adviser
for
a
passing
qualm
which
will
at
times
cloud
the
spirit
and
dazzle
the
eyesight
of
the
bravest
and
most
experienced
raise
yourself
upon
the
trunk
of
the
tree
and
advance
closer
to
the
rock
out
of
which
it
grows
observe
the
place
well
it
is
easy
for
you
when
you
have
attained
the
lower
part
of
the
projecting
stem
to
gain
by
one
bold
step
the
solid
rock
upon
which
i
stand
after
which
there
is
no
danger
or
difficulty
worthy
of
mention
to
a
young
man
whose
limbs
are
whole
and
whose
courage
is
active
my
limbs
are
indeed
sound
replied
the
youth
but
i
am
ashamed
to
think
how
much
my
courage
is
broken
yet
i
will
not
disgrace
the
interest
you
have
taken
in
an
unhappy
wanderer
by
listening
longer
to
the
dastardly
suggestions
of
a
feeling
which
till
has
been
a
stranger
to
my
bosom
the
maiden
looked
on
him
anxiously
and
with
much
interest
as
raising
himself
cautiously
and
moving
along
the
trunk
of
the
tree
which
lay
nearly
horizontal
from
the
rock
and
seemed
to
bend
as
he
changed
his
posture
the
youth
at
length
stood
upright
within
what
on
level
ground
had
been
but
an
extended
stride
to
the
cliff
on
which
the
swiss
maiden
stood
but
instead
of
being
a
step
to
be
taken
on
the
level
and
firm
earth
it
was
one
which
must
cross
a
dark
abyss
at
the
bottom
of
which
a
torrent
surged
and
boiled
with
incredible
fury
arthur
knees
knocked
against
each
other
his
feet
became
of
lead
and
seemed
no
longer
at
his
command
and
he
experienced
in
a
stronger
degree
than
ever
that
unnerving
influence
which
those
who
have
been
overwhelmed
by
it
in
a
situation
of
like
peril
never
can
forget
and
which
others
happily
strangers
to
its
power
may
have
difficulty
even
in
comprehending
the
young
woman
discerned
his
emotion
and
foresaw
its
probable
consequences
as
the
only
mode
in
her
power
to
restore
his
confidence
she
sprang
lightly
from
the
rock
to
the
stem
of
the
tree
on
which
she
alighted
with
the
ease
and
security
of
a
bird
and
in
the
same
instant
back
to
the
cliff
and
extending
her
hand
to
the
stranger
my
arm
she
said
is
but
a
slight
balustrade
yet
do
but
step
forward
with
resolution
and
you
will
find
it
as
secure
as
the
battlement
of
berne
but
shame
now
overcame
terror
so
much
that
arthur
declining
assistance
which
he
could
not
have
accepted
without
feeling
lowered
in
his
own
eyes
took
heart
of
grace
and
successfully
achieved
the
formidable
step
which
placed
him
upon
the
same
cliff
with
his
kind
assistant
to
seize
her
hand
and
raise
it
to
his
lips
in
affectionate
token
of
gratitude
and
respect
was
naturally
the
youth
first
action
nor
was
it
possible
for
the
maiden
to
have
prevented
him
from
doing
so
without
assuming
a
degree
of
prudery
foreign
to
her
character
and
occasioning
a
ceremonious
debate
upon
a
matter
of
no
great
consequence
where
the
scene
of
action
was
a
rock
scarce
five
feet
long
by
three
in
width
and
which
looked
down
upon
a
torrent
roaring
some
three
hundred
feet
below

of

thus
placed
together
in
a
situation
which
brought
them
into
the
closest
possible
contiguity
felt
a
slight
degree
of
embarrassment
the
young
man
doubtless
from
the
fear
of
being
judged
a
poltroon
in
the
eyes
of
the
maiden
by
whom
he
had
been
rescued
and
the
young
woman
perhaps
in
consequence
of
the
exertion
she
had
made
or
a
sense
of
being
placed
suddenly
in
a
situation
of
such
proximity
to
the
youth
whose
life
she
had
probably
saved
and
now
maiden
said
arthur
i
must
repair
to
my
father
the
life
which
i
owe
to
your
assistance
can
scarce
be
called
welcome
to
me
unless
i
am
permitted
to
hasten
to
his
rescue
he
was
here
interrupted
by
another
which
seemed
to
come
from
the
quarter
in
which
the
elder
philipson
and
his
guide
had
been
left
by
their
young
and
daring
companion
arthur
looked
in
that
direction
but
the
platform
which
he
had
seen
but
imperfectly
from
the
tree
when
he
was
perched
in
that
place
of
refuge
was
invisible
from
the
rock
on
which
they
now
stood
it
would
cost
me
nothing
to
step
back
on
yonder
root
said
the
young
woman
to
spy
from
thence
whether
i
could
see
aught
of
your
friends
but
i
am
convinced
they
are
under
safer
guidance
than
either
yours
or
mine
for
the
horn
announces
that
my
uncle
or
some
of
my
young
kinsmen
have
reached
them
they
are
by
this
time
on
their
way
to
the
geierstein
to
which
with
your
permission
i
will
become
your
guide
for
you
may
be
assured
that
my
uncle
arnold
will
not
allow
you
to
pass
farther
and
we
shall
but
lose
time
by
endeavouring
to
find
your
friends
who
situated
where
you
say
you
left
them
will
reach
the
geierstein
sooner
than
we
shall
follow
me
then
or
i
must
suppose
you
weary
of
my
guidance
sooner
suppose
me
weary
of
the
life
which
your
guidance
has
in
all
probability
saved
replied
arthur
and
prepared
to
attend
her
at
the
same
time
taking
a
view
of
her
dress
and
person
which
confirmed
the
satisfaction
he
had
in
following
such
a
conductor
and
which
we
shall
take
the
liberty
to
detail
somewhat
more
minutely
than
he
could
do
at
that
time
an
upper
vest
neither
so
close
as
to
display
the
person
a
habit
forbidden
by
the
sumptuary
laws
of
the
canton
nor
so
loose
as
to
be
an
incumbrance
in
walking
or
climbing
covered
a
close
tunic
of
a
different
colour
and
came
down
beneath
the
middle
of
the
leg
but
suffered
the
ankle
in
all
its
fine
proportions
to
be
completely
visible
the
foot
was
defended
by
a
sandal
the
point
of
which
was
turned
upwards
and
the
crossings
and
knots
of
the
strings
which
secured
it
on
the
front
of
the
leg
were
garnished
with
silver
rings
the
upper
vest
was
gathered
round
the
middle
by
a
sash
of
silk
ornamented
with
twisted
threads
of
gold
while
the
tunic
open
at
the
throat
permitted
the
shape
and
exquisite
whiteness
of
a
neck
to
be
visible
at
the
collar
and
for
an
inch
or
two
beneath
the
small
portion
of
the
throat
and
bosom
thus
exposed
was
even
more
brilliantly
fair
than
was
promised
by
the
countenance
which
last
bore
some
marks
of
having
been
freely
exposed
to
the
sun
and
air
by
no
means
in
a
degree
to
diminish
its
beauty
but
just
so
far
as
to
show
that
the
maiden
possessed
the
health
which
is
purchased
by
habits
of
rural
exercise
her
long
fair
hair
fell
down
in
a
profusion
of
curls
on
each
side
of
a
face
whose
blue
eyes
lovely
features
and
dignified
simplicity
of
expression
implied
at
once
a
character
of
gentleness
and
of
the
resolution
of
a
mind
too
virtuous
to
suspect
evil
and
too
noble
to
fear
it
above
these
locks
beauty
natural
and
most
beseeming
ornament
or
rather
i
should
say
amongst
them
was
placed
the
small
bonnet
which
from
its
size
little
answered
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
head
but
served
to
exercise
the
ingenuity
of
the
fair
wearer
who
had
not
failed
according
to
the
prevailing
custom
of
the
mountain
maidens
to
decorate
the
tiny
cap
with
a
heron
feather
and
the
then
unusual
luxury
of
a
small
and
thin
chain
of
gold
long
enough
to
encircle
the
cap
four
or
five
times
and
having
the
ends
secured
under
a
broad
medal
of
the
same
costly
metal
i
have
only
to
add
that
the
stature
of
the
young
person
was
something
above
the
common
size
and
that
the
whole
contour
of
her
form
without
being
in
the
slightest
degree
masculine
resembled
that
of
minerva
rather
than
the
proud
beauties
of
juno
or
the
yielding
graces
of
venus
the
noble
brow
the
and
active
limbs
the
firm
and
yet
light
step
above
all
the
total
absence
of
anything
resembling
the
consciousness
of
personal
beauty
and
the
open
and
candid
look
which
seemed
desirous
of
knowing
nothing
that
was
hidden
and
conscious
that
she
herself
had
nothing
to
hide
were
traits
not
unworthy
of
the
goddess
of
wisdom
and
of
chastity
the
road
which
the
young
englishman
pursued
under
the
guidance
of
this
beautiful
young
woman
was
difficult
and
unequal
but
could
not
be
termed
dangerous
at
least
in
comparison
to
those
precipices
over
which
arthur
had
recently
passed
it
was
in
fact
a
continuation
of
the
path
which
the
slip
or
slide
of
earth
so
often
mentioned
had
interrupted
and
although
it
had
sustained
damage
in
several
places
at
the
period
of
the
same
earthquake
yet
there
were
marks
of
these
having
been
already
repaired
in
such
a
rude
manner
as
made
the
way
sufficient
for
the
necessary
intercourse
of
a
people
so
indifferent
as
the
swiss
to
smooth
or
level
paths
the
maiden
also
gave
arthur
to
understand
that
the
present
road
took
a
circuit
for
the
purpose
of
gaining
that
on
which
he
was
lately
travelling
and
that
if
he
and
his
companions
had
turned
off
at
the
place
where
this
new
track
united
with
the
old
pathway
they
would
have
escaped
the
danger
which
had
attended
their
keeping
the
road
by
the
verge
of
the
precipice
the
path
which
they
now
pursued
was
rather
averted
from
the
torrent
though
still
within
hearing
of
its
sullen
thunders
which
seemed
to
increase
as
they
ascended
parallel
to
its
course
till
suddenly
the
road
turning
short
and
directing
itself
straight
upon
the
old
castle
brought
them
within
sight
of
one
of
the
most
splendid
and
awful
scenes
of
that
mountainous
region
the
ancient
tower
of
geierstein
though
neither
extensive
nor
distinguished
by
architectural
ornament
possessed
an
air
of
terrible
dignity
by
its
position
on
the
very
verge
of
the
opposite
bank
of
the
torrent
which
just
at
the
angle
of
the
rock
on
which
the
ruins
are
situated
falls
sheer
over
a
cascade
of
nearly
a
hundred
feet
in
height
and
then
rushes
down
the
defile
through
a
trough
of
living
rock
which
perhaps
its
waves
have
been
deepening
since
time
itself
had
a
commencement
facing
and
at
the
same
time
looking
down
upon
this
eternal
roar
of
waters
stood
the
old
tower
built
so
close
to
the
verge
of
the
precipice
that
the
buttresses
with
which
the
architect
had
strengthened
the
foundation
seemed
a
part
of
the
solid
rock
itself
and
a
continuation
of
its
perpendicular
ascent
as
usual
throughout
europe
in
the
feudal
times
the
principal
part
of
the
building
was
a
massive
square
pile
the
decayed
summit
of
which
was
rendered
picturesque
by
flanking
turrets
of
different
sizes
and
heights
some
round
some
angular
some
ruinous
some
tolerably
entire
varying
the
outline
of
the
building
as
seen
against
the
stormy
sky
a
projecting
sallyport
descending
by
a
flight
of
steps
from
the
tower
had
in
former
times
given
access
to
a
bridge
connecting
the
castle
with
that
side
of
the
stream
on
which
arthur
philipson
and
his
fair
guide
now
stood
a
single
arch
or
rather
one
rib
of
an
arch
consisting
of
single
stones
still
remained
and
spanned
the
river
immediately
in
front
of
the
waterfall
in
former
times
this
arch
had
served
for
the
support
of
a
wooden
drawbridge
of
more
convenient
breadth
and
of
such
length
and
weight
as
must
have
been
rather
unmanageable
had
it
not
been
lowered
on
some
solid
it
is
true
the
device
was
attended
with
this
inconvenience
that
even
when
the
drawbridge
was
up
there
remained
a
possibility
of
approaching
the
castle
gate
by
means
of
this
narrow
rib
of
stone
but
as
it
was
not
above
eighteen
inches
broad
and
could
only
admit
the
daring
foe
who
should
traverse
it
to
a
doorway
regularly
defended
by
gate
and
portcullis
and
having
flanking
turrets
and
projections
from
which
stones
darts
melted
lead
and
scalding
water
might
be
poured
down
on
the
soldiery
who
should
venture
to
approach
geierstein
by
this
precarious
access
the
possibility
of
such
an
attempt
was
not
considered
as
diminishing
the
security
of
the
garrison
in
the
time
we
treat
of
the
castle
being
entirely
ruined
and
dismantled
and
the
door
drawbridge
and
portcullis
gone
the
dilapidated
gateway
and
the
slender
arch
which
connected
the
two
sides
of
the
stream
were
used
as
a
means
of
communication
between
the
banks
of
the
river
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
neighbourhood
whom
habit
had
familiarised
with
the
dangerous
nature
of
the
passage
arthur
philipson
had
in
the
meantime
like
a
good
bow
when
new
strung
regained
the
elasticity
of
feeling
and
character
which
was
natural
to
him
it
was
not
indeed
with
perfect
composure
that
he
followed
his
guide
as
she
tripped
lightly
over
the
narrow
arch
composed
of
rugged
stones
and
rendered
wet
and
slippery
with
the
perpetual
drizzle
of
the
mist
issuing
from
the
neighbouring
cascade
nor
was
it
without
apprehension
that
he
found
himself
performing
this
perilous
feat
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
waterfall
itself
whose
deafening
roar
he
could
not
exclude
from
his
ears
though
he
took
care
not
to
turn
his
head
towards
its
terrors
lest
his
brain
should
again
be
dizzied
by
the
tumult
of
the
waters
as
they
shot
forward
from
the
precipice
above
and
plunged
themselves
into
what
seemed
the
fathomless
gulf
below
but
notwithstanding
these
feelings
of
agitation
the
natural
shame
to
show
cowardice
where
a
beautiful
young
female
exhibited
so
much
indifference
and
the
desire
to
regain
his
character
in
the
eyes
of
his
guide
prevented
arthur
from
again
giving
way
to
the
appalling
feelings
by
which
he
had
been
overwhelmed
a
short
time
before
stepping
firmly
on
yet
cautiously
supporting
himself
with
his
piked
staff
he
traced
the
light
footsteps
of
his
guide
along
the
bridge
of
dread
and
followed
her
through
the
ruined
sallyport
to
which
they
ascended
by
stairs
which
were
equally
dilapidated
the
gateway
admitted
them
into
a
mass
of
ruins
formerly
a
sort
of
courtyard
to
the
donjon
which
rose
in
gloomy
dignity
above
the
wreck
of
what
had
been
works
destined
for
external
defence
or
buildings
for
internal
accommodation
they
quickly
passed
through
these
ruins
over
which
vegetation
had
thrown
a
wild
mantle
of
ivy
and
other
creeping
shrubs
and
issued
from
them
through
the
main
gate
of
the
castle
into
one
of
those
spots
in
which
nature
often
embosoms
her
sweetest
charms
in
the
midst
of
districts
chiefly
characterised
by
waste
and
desolation
the
castle
in
this
aspect
also
rose
considerably
above
the
neighbouring
ground
but
the
elevation
of
the
site
which
towards
the
torrent
was
an
abrupt
rock
was
on
this
side
a
steep
eminence
which
had
been
scarped
like
a
modern
glacis
to
render
the
building
more
secure
it
was
now
covered
with
young
trees
and
bushes
out
of
which
the
tower
itself
seemed
to
rise
in
ruined
dignity
beyond
this
hanging
thicket
the
view
was
of
a
very
different
character
a
piece
of
ground
amounting
to
more
than
a
hundred
acres
seemed
scooped
out
of
the
rocks
and
mountains
which
retaining
the
same
savage
character
with
the
tract
in
which
the
travellers
had
been
that
morning
bewildered
enclosed
and
as
it
were
defended
a
limited
space
of
a
mild
and
fertile
character
the
surface
of
this
little
domain
was
considerably
varied
but
its
general
aspect
was
a
gentle
slope
to
the
the
principal
object
which
it
presented
was
a
large
house
composed
of
huge
logs
without
any
pretence
to
form
or
symmetry
but
indicating
by
the
smoke
which
arose
from
it
as
well
as
the
extent
of
the
neighbouring
offices
and
the
improved
and
cultivated
character
of
the
fields
around
that
it
was
the
abode
not
of
splendour
certainly
but
of
ease
and
competence
an
orchard
of
thriving
extended
to
the
southward
of
the
dwelling
groves
of
walnut
and
chestnut
grew
in
stately
array
and
even
a
vineyard
of
three
or
four
acres
showed
that
the
cultivation
of
the
grape
was
understood
and
practised
it
is
now
universal
in
switzerland
but
was
in
those
early
days
almost
exclusively
confined
to
a
few
more
fortunate
proprietors
who
had
the
rare
advantage
of
uniting
intelligence
with
opulent
or
at
least
easy
circumstances

into
which
the
fine
race
of

which
constitute
the
pride
and
wealth
of
the
swiss
mountaineers
had
been
brought
down
from
the
more
alpine
grazings
where
they
had
fed
during
the
summer

be

shelter

giving
at
the

time
a

to
a
scene
otherwise
agricultural

of
a
small
brook
might
be

itself
to
the
sun
which
had
by

time
dispelled

fogs
now
intimating
its
course
by
its
gently
sloping
banks
clothed
in
some
places
with
lofty
trees
or
concealing
itself
under
thickets
of
hawthorn
and
nut
bushes
this
stream
by
a
devious
and
gentle
course
which
seemed
to
indicate
a
reluctance
to
leave
this
quiet
region
found
its
way
at
length
out
of
the
sequestered
domain
and
like
a
youth
hurrying
from
the
gay
and
tranquil
sports
of
boyhood
into
the
wild
career
of
active
life
finally
united
itself
with
the
boisterous
torrent
which
breaking
down
tumultuously
from
the
mountains
shook
the
ancient
tower
of
geierstein
as
it
rolled
down
the
adjacent
rock
and
then
rushed
howling
through
the
defile
in
which
our
youthful
traveller
had
lost
his
life
eager
as
the
younger
philipson
was
to
rejoin
his
father
he
could
not
help
pausing
for
a
moment
to
wonder
how
so
much
beauty
should
be
found
amid
such
scenes
of
horror
and
to
look
back
on
the
tower
of
geierstein
and
on
the
huge
cliff
from
which
it
derived
its
name
as
if
to
ascertain
by
the
sight
of
these
distinguished
landmarks
that
he
was
actually
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
savage
wild
where
he
had
encountered
so
much
danger
and
terror
yet
so
narrow
were
the
limits
of
this
cultivated
farm
that
it
hardly
required
such
a
retrospect
to
satisfy
the
spectator
that
the
spot
susceptible
of
human
industry
and
on
which
it
seemed
that
a
considerable
degree
of
labour
had
been
bestowed
bore
a
very
small
proportion
to
the
wilderness
in
which
it
was
situated
it
was
on
all
sides
surrounded
by
lofty
hills
in
some
places
rising
into
walls
of
rock
in
others
clothed
with
dark
and
savage
forests
of
the
pine
and
the
larch
of
primeval
antiquity
above
these
from
the
eminence
on
which
the
tower
was
situated
could
be
seen
the
almost
rosy
hue
in
which
an
immense
glacier
threw
back
the
sun
and
still
higher
over
the
frozen
surface
of
that
icy
sea
arose
in
silent
dignity
the
pale
peaks
of
those
countless
mountains
on
which
the
snow
eternally
rests
what
we
have
taken
some
time
to
describe
occupied
young
philipson
only
for
one
or
two
hurried
minutes
for
on
a
sloping
lawn
which
was
in
front
of
the
as
the
mansion
might
properly
be
styled
he
saw
five
or
six
persons
the
foremost
of
whom
from
his
gait
his
dress
and
the
form
of
his
cap
he
could
easily
distinguish
as
the
parent
whom
he
hardly
expected
at
one
time
to
have
again
beheld
he
followed
therefore
his
conductress
with
a
glad
step
as
she
led
the
way
down
the
steep
ascent
on
which
the
ruined
tower
was
situated
they
approached
the
group
whom
arthur
had
noticed
the
foremost
of
which
was
his
father
who
hastily
came
forward
to
meet
him
in
company
with
another
person
of
advanced
age
and
stature
gigantic
and
who
from
his
simple
yet
majestic
bearing
seemed
the
worthy
countryman
of
william
tell
stauffacher
winkelried
and
other
swiss
worthies
whose
stout
hearts
and
hardy
arms
had
in
the
preceding
age
vindicated
against
countless
hosts
their
personal
liberty
and
the
independence
of
their
country
with
a
natural
courtesy
as
if
to
spare
the
father
and
son
many
witnesses
to
a
meeting
which
must
be
attended
with
emotion
the
landamman
himself
in
walking
forward
with
the
elder
philipson
signed
to
those
by
whom
he
was
attended
all
of
whom
seemed
young
men
to
remain
behind
they
remained
accordingly
examining
as
it
seemed
the
guide
antonio
upon
the
adventures
of
the
strangers
anne
the
conductress
of
arthur
philipson
had
but
time
to
say
to
him
yonder
old
man
is
my
uncle
arnold
biederman
and
these
young
men
are
my
kinsmen
when
the
former
with
the
elder
traveller
were
close
before
them
the
landamman
with
the
same
propriety
of
feeling
which
he
had
before
displayed
signed
to
his
niece
to
move
a
little
aside
yet
while
requiring
from
her
an
account
of
her
morning
expedition
he
watched
the
interview
of
the
father
and
son
with
as
much
curiosity
as
his
natural
sense
of
complaisance
permitted
him
to
testify
it
was
of
a
character
different
from
what
he
had
expected
we
have
already
described
the
elder
philipson
as
a
father
devotedly
attached
to
his
son
ready
to
rush
on
death
when
he
had
expected
to
lose
him
and
equally
overjoyed
at
heart
doubtless
to
see
him
again
restored
to
his
affections
it
might
have
been
therefore
expected
that
the
father
and
son
would
have
rushed
into
each
other
arms
and
such
probably
was
the
scene
which
arnold
biederman
expected
to
have
witnessed
but
the
english
traveller
in
common
with
many
of
his
countrymen
covered
keen
and
quick
feelings
with
much
appearance
of
coldness
and
reserve
and
thought
it
a
weakness
to
give
unlimited
sway
even
to
the
influence
of
the
most
amiable
and
most
natural
emotions
eminently
handsome
in
youth
his
countenance
still
fine
in
his
more
advanced
years
had
an
expression
which
intimated
an
unwillingness
either
to
yield
to
passion
or
encourage
confidence
his
pace
when
he
first
beheld
his
son
had
been
quickened
by
the
natural
wish
to
meet
him
but
he
slackened
it
as
they
drew
near
to
each
other
and
when
they
met
said
in
a
tone
rather
of
censure
and
admonition
than
affection
arthur
may
the
saints
forgive
the
pain
thou
hast
this
day
given
me
amen
said
the
youth
i
must
need
pardon
since
i
have
given
you
pain
believe
however
that
i
acted
for
the
best
it
is
well
arthur
that
in
acting
for
the
best
according
to
your
forward
will
you
have
not
encountered
the
worst
that
i
have
not
answered
the
son
with
the
same
devoted
and
patient
submission
is
owing
to
this
maiden
pointing
to
anne
who
stood
at
a
few
paces
distance
desirous
perhaps
of
avoiding
to
witness
the
reproof
of
the
father
which
might
seem
to
her
rather
and
unreasonable
to
the
maiden
my
thanks
shall
be
rendered
said
his
father
when
i
can
study
how
to
pay
them
in
an
adequate
manner
but
is
it
well
or
comely
think
you
that
you
should
receive
from
a
maiden
the
succour
which
it
is
your
duty
as
a
man
to
extend
to
the
weaker
sex
arthur
held
down
his
head
and
blushed
deeply
while
arnold
biederman
sympathising
with
his
feelings
stepped
forward
and
mingled
in
the
conversation
never
be
abashed
my
young
guest
that
you
have
been
indebted
for
aught
of
counsel
or
assistance
to
a
maiden
of
unterwalden
know
that
the
freedom
of
their
country
owes
no
less
to
the
firmness
and
wisdom
of
her
daughters
than
to
that
of
her
and
you
my
elder
guest
who
have
i
judge
seen
many
years
and
various
lands
must
have
often
known
examples
how
the
strong
are
saved
by
the
help
of
the
weak
the
proud
by
the
aid
of
the
humble
i
have
at
least
learned
said
the
englishman
to
debate
no
point
unnecessarily
with
the
host
who
has
kindly
harboured
me
and
after
one
glance
at
his
son
which
seemed
to
kindle
with
the
fondest
affection
he
resumed
as
the
party
turned
back
towards
the
house
a
conversation
which
he
had
been
maintaining
with
his
new
acquaintance
before
arthur
and
the
maiden
had
joined
them
arthur
had
in
the
meantime
an
opportunity
of
observing
the
figure
and
features
of
their
swiss
landlord
which
i
have
already
hinted
exhibited
a
primeval
simplicity
mixed
with
a
certain
rude
dignity
arising
out
of
its
masculine
and
unaffected
character
the
dress
did
not
greatly
differ
in
form
from
the
habit
of
the
female
which
we
have
described
it
consisted
of
an
upper
frock
shaped
like
the
modern
shirt
and
only
open
at
the
bosom
worn
above
a
tunic
or
under
doublet
but
the
man
vest
was
considerably
shorter
in
the
skirts
which
did
not
come
lower
down
than
the
kilt
of
the
scottish
highlander
a
species
of
boots
or
buskins
rose
above
the
knee
and
the
person
was
thus
entirely
clothed
a
bonnet
made
of
the
fur
of
the
marten
and
garnished
with
a
silver
medal
was
the
only
part
of
the
dress
which
displayed
anything
like
ornament
the
broad
belt
which
gathered
the
garment
together
was
of
buff
leather
secured
by
a
large
brass
buckle
but
the
figure
of
him
who
wore
this
homely
attire
which
seemed
almost
wholly
composed
of
the
fleeces
of
the
mountain
sheep
and
the
spoils
of
animals
of
the
chase
would
have
commanded
respect
wherever
the
wearer
had
presented
himself
especially
in
those
warlike
days
when
men
were
judged
of
according
to
the
promising
or
unpromising
qualities
of
their
thews
and
sinews
to
those
who
looked
at
arnold
biederman
from
this
point
of
view
he
displayed
the
size
and
form
the
broad
shoulders
and
prominent
muscles
of
a
hercules
but
to
such
as
looked
rather
at
his
countenance
the
steady
sagacious
features
open
front
large
blue
eyes
and
deliberate
resolution
which
it
expressed
more
resembled
the
character
of
the
fabled
king
of
gods
and
men
he
was
attended
by
several
sons
and
relatives
young
men
among
whom
he
walked
receiving
as
his
undeniable
due
respect
and
obedience
similar
to
that
which
a
herd
of
deer
are
observed
to
render
to
the
monarch
stag
while
arnold
biederman
walked
and
spoke
with
the
elder
stranger
the
young
men
seemed
closely
to
scrutinise
arthur
and
occasionally
interrogated
in
whispers
their
relation
anne
receiving
from
her
brief
and
impatient
answers
which
rather
excited
than
appeased
the
vein
of
merriment
in
which
the
mountaineers
indulged
very
much
as
it
seemed
to
the
young
englishman
at
the
expense
of
their
guest
to
feel
himself
exposed
to
derision
was
not
softened
by
the
reflection
that
in
such
a
society
it
would
probably
be
attached
to
all
who
could
not
tread
on
the
edge
of
a
precipice
with
a
step
as
firm
and
undismayed
as
if
they
walked
the
street
of
a
city
however
unreasonable
ridicule
may
be
it
is
always
unpleasing
to
be
subjected
to
it
but
more
particularly
is
it
distressing
to
a
young
man
where
beauty
is
a
listener
it
was
some
consolation
to
arthur
that
he
thought
the
maiden
certainly
did
not
enjoy
the
jest
and
seemed
by
word
and
look
to
reprove
the
rudeness
of
her
companions
but
this
he
feared
was
only
from
a
sense
of
humanity
she
too
must
despise
me
he
thought
though
civility
unknown
to
these
boors
has
enabled
her
to
conceal
contempt
under
the
guise
of
pity
she
can
but
judge
of
me
from
that
which
she
has
seen
if
she
could
know
me
better
such
was
his
proud
thought
she
might
perhaps
rank
me
more
highly
as
the
travellers
entered
the
habitation
of
arnold
biederman
they
found
preparations
made
in
a
large
apartment
which
served
the
purpose
of
general
accommodation
for
a
homely
but
plentiful
meal
a
glance
round
the
walls
showed
the
implements
of
agriculture
and
the
chase
but
the
eyes
of
the
elder
philipson
rested
upon
a
leathern
corselet
a
long
heavy
halberd
and
a
sword
which
were
displayed
as
a
sort
of
trophy
near
these
but
covered
with
dust
unfurbished
and
neglected
hung
a
helmet
with
a
visor
such
as
was
used
by
knights
and
the
golden
garland
or
coronal
twisted
around
it
though
sorely
tarnished
indicated
noble
birth
and
rank
and
the
crest
which
was
a
vulture
of
the
species
which
gave
name
to
the
old
castle
and
its
adjacent
cliff
suggested
various
conjectures
to
the
english
guest
who
acquainted
in
a
great
measure
with
the
history
of
the
swiss
revolution
made
little
doubt
that
in
this
relic
he
saw
some
trophy
of
the
ancient
warfare
between
the
inhabitants
of
these
mountains
and
the
feudal
lord
to
whom
they
had
of
yore
appertained
a
summons
to
the
hospitable
board
disturbed
the
train
of
the
english
merchant
reflections
and
a
large
company
comprising
the
whole
inhabitants
of
every
description
that
lived
under
biederman
roof
sat
down
to
a
plentiful
repast
of
goat
flesh
fish
preparations
of
milk
of
various
kinds
cheese
and
for
the
upper
mess
the
venison
of
a
young
chamois
the
landamman
himself
did
the
honours
of
the
table
with
great
kindness
and
simplicity
and
urged
the
strangers
to
show
by
their
appetite
that
they
thought
themselves
as
welcome
as
he
desired
to
make
them
during
the
repast
he
carried
on
a
conversation
with
his
elder
guest
while
the
younger
people
at
table
as
well
as
the
menials
ate
in
modesty
and
silence
ere
the
dinner
was
finished
a
figure
crossed
on
the
outside
of
the
large
window
which
lighted
the
the
sight
of
which
seemed
to
occasion
a
lively
sensation
amongst
such
as
observed
it
who
passed
said
old
biederman
to
those
seated
opposite
to
the
window
it
is
our
cousin
rudolph
of
donnerhugel
answered
one
of
sons
eagerly
the
annunciation
seemed
to
give
great
pleasure
to
the
younger
part
of
the
company
especially
the
sons
of
the
landamman
while
the
head
of
the
family
only
said
with
a
grave
calm
voice
your
kinsman
is
welcome
tell
him
so
and
let
him
come
hither
two
or
three
arose
for
this
purpose
as
if
there
had
been
a
contention
among
them
who
should
do
the
honours
of
the
house
to
the
new
guest
he
entered
presently
a
young
man
unusually
tall
and
active
with
a
quantity
of
locks
curling
around
his
face
together
with
mustaches
of
the
same
or
rather
a
still
darker
hue
his
cap
was
small
considering
the
quantity
of
his
thickly
clustering
hair
and
rather
might
be
said
to
hang
upon
one
side
of
his
head
than
to
cover
it
his
clothes
were
of
the
same
form
and
general
fashion
as
those
of
arnold
but
made
of
much
finer
cloth
the
manufacture
of
the
german
loom
and
ornamented
in
a
rich
and
fanciful
manner
one
sleeve
of
his
vest
was
dark
green
curiously
laced
and
embroidered
with
devices
in
silver
while
the
rest
of
the
garment
was
scarlet
his
sash
was
twisted
and
netted
with
gold
and
besides
answering
the
purpose
of
a
belt
by
securing
the
upper
garment
round
his
waist
sustained
a
poniard
his
finery
was
completed
by
boots
the
tips
of
which
were
so
long
as
to
turn
upwards
with
a
peak
after
a
prevailing
fashion
in
the
middle
ages
a
golden
chain
hung
round
his
neck
and
sustained
a
large
medallion
of
the
same
metal
this
young
gallant
was
instantly
surrounded
by
the
race
of
biederman
among
whom
he
appeared
to
be
considered
as
the
model
upon
which
the
swiss
youth
ought
to
build
themselves
and
whose
gait
opinions
dress
and
manners
all
ought
to
follow
who
would
keep
pace
with
the
fashion
of
the
day
in
which
he
reigned
an
acknowledged
and
unrivalled
example
by
two
persons
in
the
company
however
it
seemed
to
arthur
philipson
that
this
young
man
was
received
with
less
distinguished
marks
of
regard
than
those
with
which
he
was
hailed
by
the
general
voice
of
the
youths
present
arnold
biederman
himself
was
at
least
no
way
warm
in
welcoming
the
young
bernese
for
such
was
rudolph
country
the
young
man
drew
from
his
bosom
a
sealed
packet
which
he
delivered
to
the
landamman
with
demonstrations
of
great
respect
and
seemed
to
expect
that
arnold
when
he
had
broken
the
seal
and
perused
the
contents
would
say
something
to
him
on
the
subject
but
the
patriarch
only
bade
him
be
seated
and
partake
of
their
meal
and
rudolph
found
a
place
accordingly
next
to
anne
of
geierstein
which
was
yielded
to
him
by
one
of
the
sons
of
arnold
with
ready
courtesy
it
seemed
also
to
the
observant
young
englishman
that
the
new
comer
was
received
with
marked
coldness
by
the
maiden
to
whom
he
appeared
eager
and
solicitous
to
pay
his
compliments
by
whose
side
he
had
contrived
to
seat
himself
at
the
board
and
to
whom
he
seemed
more
anxious
to
recommend
himself
than
to
partake
of
the
food
which
it
offered
he
observed
the
gallant
whisper
her
and
look
towards
him
anne
gave
a
very
brief
reply
but
one
of
the
young
biedermans
who
sat
on
his
other
hand
was
probably
more
communicative
as
the
youths
both
laughed
and
the
maiden
again
seemed
disconcerted
and
blushed
with
displeasure
had
i
either
of
these
sons
of
the
mountain
thought
young
philipson
upon
six
yards
of
level
greensward
if
there
be
so
much
flat
ground
in
this
country
methinks
i
were
more
likely
to
spoil
their
mirth
than
to
furnish
food
for
it
it
is
as
marvellous
to
see
such
conceited
boors
under
the
same
roof
with
so
courteous
and
amiable
a
damsel
as
it
would
be
to
see
one
of
their
shaggy
bears
dance
a
rigadoon
with
a
maiden
like
the
daughter
of
our
host
well
i
need
not
concern
myself
more
than
i
can
help
about
her
beauty
or
their
breeding
since
morning
will
separate
me
from
them
for
ever
as
these
reflections
passed
through
the
young
guest
mind
the
father
of
the
family
called
for
a
cup
of
wine
and
having
required
the
two
strangers
to
pledge
him
in
a
maple
cup
of
considerable
size
he
sent
a
similar
goblet
to
rudolph
donnerhugel
yet
you
he
said
kinsman
are
used
to
more
highly
flavoured
wine
than
the
grapes
of
geierstein
can
would
you
think
it
sir
merchant
he
continued
addressing
philipson
there
are
burghers
of
berne
who
send
for
wine
for
their
own
drinking
both
to
france
and
germany
my
kinsman
disapproves
of
that
replied
rudolph
yet
every
place
is
not
blessed
with
vineyards
like
geierstein
which
produces
all
that
heart
and
eye
can
desire
this
was
said
with
a
glance
at
his
fair
companion
who
did
not
appear
to
take
the
compliment
while
the
envoy
of
berne
proceeded
but
our
wealthier
burghers
having
some
superfluous
crowns
think
it
no
extravagance
to
barter
them
for
a
goblet
of
better
wine
than
our
own
mountains
can
produce
but
we
will
be
more
frugal
when
we
have
at
our
disposal
tuns
of
the
wine
of
burgundy
for
the
mere
trouble
of
transporting
them
how
mean
you
by
that
cousin
rudolph
said
arnold
biederman
methinks
respected
kinsman
answered
the
bernese
your
letters
must
have
told
you
that
our
diet
is
likely
to
declare
war
against
burgundy
ah
and
you
know
then
the
contents
of
my
letters
said
arnold
another
mark
how
times
are
changed
at
berne
and
with
the
diet
of
switzerland
when
did
all
her
statesmen
die
that
our
allies
should
have
brought
beardless
boys
into
their
councils
the
senate
of
berne
and
the
diet
of
the
confederacy
said
the
young
man
partly
abashed
partly
in
vindication
of
what
he
had
before
spoken
allow
the
young
men
to
know
their
purposes
since
it
is
they
by
whom
they
must
be
executed
the
head
which
thinks
may
well
confide
in
the
hand
that
strikes
not
till
the
moment
of
dealing
the
blow
young
man
said
arnold
biederman
sternly
what
kind
of
counsellor
is
he
who
talks
loosely
the
secrets
of
state
affairs
before
women
and
strangers
go
rudolph
and
all
of
ye
and
try
by
manly
exercises
which
is
best
fitted
to
serve
your
country
rather
than
give
your
judgment
upon
her
hold
young
man
he
continued
addressing
arthur
who
had
arisen
this
does
not
apply
to
you
who
are
unused
to
mountain
travel
and
require
rest
after
it
under
your
favour
sir
not
so
said
the
elder
stranger
we
hold
in
england
that
the
best
refreshment
after
we
have
been
exhausted
by
one
species
of
exercise
is
to
betake
ourselves
to
another
as
riding
for
example
affords
more
relief
to
one
fatigued
by
walking
than
a
bed
of
down
would
so
if
your
young
men
will
permit
my
son
will
join
their
exercises
he
will
find
them
rough
playmates
answered
the
switzer
but
be
it
at
your
pleasure
the
young
men
went
out
accordingly
to
the
open
lawn
in
front
of
the
house
anne
of
geierstein
and
some
females
of
the
household
sat
down
on
a
bank
to
judge
which
performed
best
and
shouts
loud
laughing
and
all
that
announces
the
riot
of
juvenile
spirits
occupied
by
manly
sports
was
soon
after
heard
by
the
two
seniors
as
they
sat
together
in
the
hall
the
master
of
the
house
resumed
the
and
having
filled
the
cup
of
his
guest
poured
the
remainder
into
his
own
at
an
age
worthy
stranger
he
said
when
the
blood
grows
colder
and
the
feelings
heavier
a
moderate
cup
of
wine
brings
back
light
thoughts
and
makes
the
limbs
supple
yet
i
almost
wish
that
noah
had
never
planted
the
grape
when
of
late
years
i
have
seen
with
my
own
eyes
my
countrymen
swill
wine
like
very
germans
till
they
were
like
gorged
swine
incapable
of
sense
thought
or
motion
it
is
a
vice
said
the
englishman
which
i
have
observed
gains
ground
in
your
country
where
within
a
century
i
have
heard
it
was
totally
unknown
it
was
so
said
the
swiss
for
wine
was
seldom
made
at
home
and
never
imported
from
abroad
for
indeed
none
possessed
the
means
of
purchasing
that
or
aught
else
which
our
valleys
produce
not
but
our
wars
and
our
victories
have
gained
us
wealth
as
well
as
fame
and
in
the
poor
thoughts
of
one
switzer
at
least
we
had
been
better
without
both
had
we
not
also
gained
liberty
by
the
same
exertion
it
is
something
however
that
commerce
may
occasionally
send
into
our
remote
mountains
a
sensible
visitor
like
yourself
worthy
guest
whose
discourse
shows
him
to
be
a
man
of
sagacity
and
discernment
for
though
i
love
not
the
increasing
taste
for
trinkets
and
gewgaws
which
you
merchants
introduce
yet
i
acknowledge
that
we
simple
mountaineers
learn
from
men
like
you
more
of
the
world
around
us
than
we
could
acquire
by
our
own
exertions
you
are
bound
you
say
to
bâle
and
thence
to
the
duke
of
burgundy
leaguer
i
am
so
my
worthy
host
said
the
merchant
that
is
providing
i
can
perform
my
journey
with
safety
your
safety
good
friend
may
be
assured
if
you
list
to
tarry
for
two
or
three
days
for
in
that
space
i
shall
myself
take
the
journey
and
with
such
an
escort
as
will
prevent
any
risk
of
danger
you
will
find
in
me
a
sure
and
faithful
guide
and
i
shall
learn
from
you
much
of
other
countries
which
it
concerns
me
to
know
better
than
i
do
is
it
a
bargain
the
proposal
is
too
much
to
my
advantage
to
be
refused
said
the
englishman
but
may
i
ask
the
purpose
of
your
journey
i
chid
yonder
boy
but
now
answered
biederman
for
speaking
on
public
affairs
without
reflection
and
before
the
whole
family
but
our
tidings
and
my
errand
need
not
be
concealed
from
a
considerate
person
like
you
who
must
indeed
soon
learn
it
from
public
rumour
you
know
doubtless
the
mutual
hatred
which
subsists
between
louis
xi
of
france
and
charles
of
burgundy
whom
men
call
the
bold
and
having
seen
these
countries
as
i
understand
from
your
former
discourse
you
are
probably
well
aware
of
the
various
contending
interests
which
besides
the
personal
hatred
of
the
sovereigns
make
them
irreconcilable
enemies
now
louis
whom
the
world
can
not
match
for
craft
and
subtlety
is
using
all
his
influence
by
distributions
of
large
sums
amongst
some
of
the
counsellors
of
our
neighbours
of
berne
by
pouring
treasures
into
the
exchequer
of
that
state
itself
by
holding
out
the
bait
of
emolument
to
the
old
men
and
encouraging
the
violence
of
the
young
to
urge
the
bernese
into
a
war
with
the
duke
charles
on
the
other
hand
is
acting
as
he
frequently
does
exactly
as
louis
could
have
wished
our
neighbours
and
allies
of
berne
do
not
like
us
of
the
forest
cantons
confine
themselves
to
pasture
or
agriculture
but
carry
on
considerable
commerce
which
the
duke
of
burgundy
has
in
various
instances
interrupted
by
the
exactions
and
violence
of
his
officers
in
the
frontier
towns
as
is
doubtless
well
known
to
you
unquestionably
answered
the
merchant
they
are
universally
regarded
as
vexatious
you
will
not
then
be
surprised
that
solicited
by
the
one
sovereign
and
aggrieved
by
the
other
proud
of
past
victories
and
ambitious
of
additional
power
berne
and
the
city
cantons
of
our
confederacy
whose
representatives
from
their
superior
wealth
and
better
education
have
more
to
say
in
our
diet
than
we
of
the
forests
should
be
bent
upon
war
from
which
it
has
hitherto
happened
that
the
republic
has
always
derived
victory
wealth
and
increase
of
territory
ay
worthy
host
and
of
glory
said
philipson
interrupting
him
with
some
enthusiasm
i
wonder
not
that
the
brave
youths
of
your
states
are
willing
to
thrust
themselves
upon
new
wars
since
their
past
victories
have
been
so
brilliant
and
so
you
are
no
wise
merchant
kind
guest
answered
the
host
if
you
regard
success
in
former
desperate
undertakings
as
an
encouragement
to
future
rashness
let
us
make
a
better
use
of
past
victories
when
we
fought
for
our
liberties
god
blessed
our
arms
but
will
he
do
so
if
we
fight
either
for
aggrandisement
or
for
the
gold
of
france
your
doubt
is
just
said
the
merchant
more
sedately
but
suppose
you
draw
the
sword
to
put
an
end
to
the
vexatious
exactions
of
burgundy
hear
me
good
friend
answered
the
switzer
it
may
be
that
we
of
the
forest
cantons
think
too
little
of
those
matters
of
trade
which
so
much
engross
the
attention
of
the
burghers
of
berne
yet
we
will
not
desert
our
neighbours
and
allies
in
a
just
quarrel
and
it
is
settled
that
a
deputation
shall
be
sent
to
the
duke
of
burgundy
to
request
redress
in
this
embassy
the
general
diet
now
assembled
at
berne
have
requested
that
i
should
take
some
share
and
hence
the
journey
in
which
i
propose
that
you
should
accompany
me
it
will
be
much
to
my
satisfaction
to
travel
in
your
company
worthy
host
said
the
englishman
but
as
i
am
a
true
man
methinks
your
port
and
figure
resemble
an
envoy
of
defiance
rather
than
a
messenger
of
peace
and
i
too
might
say
replied
the
switzer
that
your
language
and
sentiments
my
honoured
guest
rather
belong
to
the
sword
than
the
i
was
bred
to
the
sword
worthy
sir
before
i
took
the
in
my
hand
replied
philipson
smiling
and
it
may
be
i
am
still
more
partial
to
my
old
trade
than
wisdom
would
altogether
recommend
i
thought
so
said
arnold
but
then
you
fought
most
likely
under
your
country
banners
against
a
foreign
and
national
enemy
and
in
that
case
i
will
admit
that
war
has
something
in
it
which
elevates
the
heart
above
the
due
sense
it
should
entertain
of
the
calamity
inflicted
and
endured
by
god
creatures
on
each
side
but
the
warfare
in
which
i
was
engaged
had
no
such
gilding
it
was
the
miserable
war
of
zurich
where
switzers
levelled
their
pikes
against
the
bosoms
of
their
own
countrymen
and
quarter
was
asked
and
refused
in
the
same
kindly
mountain
language
from
such
remembrances
your
warlike
recollections
are
probably
free
the
merchant
hung
down
his
head
and
pressed
his
forehead
with
his
hand
as
one
to
whom
the
most
painful
thoughts
were
suddenly
recalled
alas
he
said
i
deserve
to
feel
the
pain
which
your
words
inflict
what
nation
can
know
the
woes
of
england
that
has
not
felt
them
what
eye
can
estimate
them
which
has
not
seen
a
land
torn
and
bleeding
with
the
strife
of
two
desperate
factions
battles
fought
in
every
province
plains
heaped
with
slain
and
scaffolds
drenched
in
blood
even
in
your
quiet
valleys
methinks
you
may
have
heard
of
the
civil
wars
of
england
i
do
indeed
bethink
me
said
the
switzer
that
england
had
lost
her
possessions
in
france
during
many
years
of
bloody
internal
wars
concerning
the
colour
of
a
rose
was
it
not
but
these
are
ended
for
the
present
answered
philipson
it
would
seem
so
as
he
spoke
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
the
master
of
the
house
said
come
in
the
door
opened
and
with
the
reverence
which
was
expected
from
young
persons
towards
their
elders
in
those
pastoral
regions
the
fine
form
of
anne
of
geierstein
presented
itself
chapter
iv
and
now
the
bow
the
master
bore
turn
on
all
sides
and
view
it
and
whilst
some
deriding
how
he
turns
the
bow
some
other
like
it
sure
the
man
must
know
or
else
would
copy
or
in
bows
he
deals
perhaps
he
makes
them
or
perhaps
he
steals
pope
the
fair
maiden
approached
with
the
look
which
sits
so
well
on
a
young
housekeeper
when
she
is
at
once
proud
and
ashamed
of
the
matronly
duties
she
is
called
upon
to
discharge
and
whispered
something
in
her
uncle
ear
and
could
not
the
boys
have
brought
their
own
errand
what
is
it
they
want
that
they
can
not
ask
themselves
but
must
send
thee
to
beg
it
for
them
had
it
been
anything
reasonable
i
should
have
heard
it
dinned
into
my
ears
by
forty
voices
so
modest
are
our
swiss
youths
become
nowadays
she
stooped
forward
and
again
whispered
in
his
ear
as
he
fondly
stroked
her
curling
tresses
with
his
ample
hand
and
replied
the
bow
of
buttisholz
my
dear
why
the
youths
surely
are
not
grown
stronger
since
last
year
when
none
of
them
could
bend
it
but
yonder
it
hangs
with
its
three
arrows
who
is
the
wise
champion
that
is
challenger
at
a
game
where
he
is
sure
to
be
foiled
it
is
this
gentleman
son
sir
said
the
maiden
who
not
being
able
to
contend
with
my
cousins
in
running
leaping
hurling
the
bar
or
pitching
the
stone
has
challenged
them
to
ride
or
to
shoot
with
the
english
to
ride
said
the
venerable
swiss
were
difficult
where
there
are
no
horses
and
no
level
ground
to
career
upon
if
there
were
but
an
english
bow
he
shall
have
since
we
happen
to
possess
one
take
it
to
the
young
men
my
niece
with
the
three
arrows
and
say
to
them
from
me
that
he
who
bends
it
will
do
more
than
william
tell
or
the
renowned
stauffacher
could
have
done
as
the
maiden
went
to
take
the
weapon
from
the
place
where
it
hung
amid
the
group
of
arms
which
philipson
had
formerly
remarked
the
english
merchant
observed
that
were
the
minstrels
of
his
land
to
assign
her
occupation
so
fair
a
maiden
should
be
to
none
but
the
little
blind
god
cupid
i
will
have
nothing
of
the
blind
god
cupid
said
arnold
hastily
yet
half
laughing
at
the
same
time
we
have
been
deafened
with
the
foolery
of
minstrels
and
strolling
minnesingers
ever
since
the
wandering
knaves
have
found
there
were
pence
to
be
gathered
among
us
a
swiss
maiden
should
only
sing
albert
ischudi
ballads
or
the
merry
lay
of
the
going
out
and
return
of
the
cows
to
and
from
the
mountain
pastures
while
he
spoke
the
damsel
had
selected
from
the
arms
a
bow
of
extraordinary
strength
considerably
above
six
feet
in
length
with
three
shafts
of
a
long
philipson
asked
to
look
at
the
weapons
and
examined
them
closely
it
is
a
tough
piece
of
yew
he
said
i
should
know
it
since
i
have
dealt
in
such
commodities
in
my
time
but
when
i
was
of
arthur
age
i
could
have
bent
it
as
easily
as
a
boy
bends
a
willow
we
are
too
old
to
boast
like
boys
said
arnold
biederman
with
something
of
a
reproving
glance
at
his
companion
carry
the
bow
to
thy
kinsmen
anne
and
let
him
who
can
bend
it
say
he
beat
arnold
biederman
as
he
spoke
he
turned
his
eyes
on
the
spare
yet
muscular
figure
of
the
englishman
then
again
glanced
down
on
his
own
stately
person
you
must
remember
good
my
host
said
philipson
that
weapons
are
wielded
not
by
strength
but
by
art
and
sleight
of
hand
what
most
i
wonder
at
is
to
see
in
this
place
a
bow
made
by
matthew
of
doncaster
a
bowyer
who
lived
at
least
a
hundred
years
ago
remarkable
for
the
great
toughness
and
strength
of
the
weapons
which
he
made
and
which
are
now
become
somewhat
unmanageable
even
by
an
english
yeoman
how
are
you
assured
of
the
maker
name
worthy
guest
replied
the
swiss
by
old
matthew
mark
answered
the
englishman
and
his
initials
cut
upon
the
bow
i
wonder
not
a
little
to
find
such
a
weapon
here
and
in
such
good
preservation
it
has
been
regularly
waxed
oiled
and
kept
in
good
order
said
the
landamman
being
preserved
as
a
trophy
of
a
memorable
day
it
would
but
grieve
you
to
recount
its
early
history
since
it
was
taken
in
a
day
fatal
to
your
country
my
country
said
the
englishman
composedly
has
gained
so
many
victories
that
her
children
may
well
afford
to
hear
of
a
single
defeat
but
i
knew
not
that
the
english
ever
warred
in
switzerland
not
precisely
as
a
nation
answered
biederman
but
it
was
in
my
grandsire
days
that
a
large
body
of
roving
soldiers
composed
of
men
from
almost
all
countries
but
especially
englishmen
normans
and
gascons
poured
down
on
the
argau
and
the
districts
adjacent
they
were
headed
by
a
great
warrior
called
ingelram
de
couci
who
pretended
some
claims
upon
the
duke
of
austria
to
satisfy
which
he
ravaged
indifferently
the
austrian
territory
and
that
of
our
confederacy
his
soldiers
were
hired
warriors
free
companions
they
called
themselves
that
seemed
to
belong
to
no
country
and
were
as
brave
in
the
fight
as
they
were
cruel
in
their
depredations
some
pause
in
the
constant
wars
betwixt
france
and
england
had
deprived
many
of
those
bands
of
their
ordinary
employment
and
battle
being
their
element
they
came
to
seek
it
among
our
valleys
the
air
seemed
on
fire
with
the
blaze
of
their
armour
and
the
very
sun
was
darkened
at
the
flight
of
their
arrows
they
did
us
much
evil
and
we
sustained
the
loss
of
more
than
one
battle
but
we
met
them
at
buttisholz
and
mingled
the
blood
of
many
a
rider
noble
as
they
were
called
and
esteemed
with
that
of
their
horses
the
huge
mound
that
covers
the
bones
of
man
and
steed
is
still
called
the
english
barrow
philipson
was
silent
for
a
minute
or
two
and
then
replied
then
let
them
sleep
in
peace
if
they
did
wrong
they
paid
for
it
with
their
lives
and
that
is
all
the
ransom
that
mortal
man
can
render
for
his
heaven
pardon
their
souls
amen
replied
the
landamman
and
those
of
all
brave
men
my
grandsire
was
at
the
battle
and
was
held
to
have
demeaned
himself
like
a
good
soldier
and
this
bow
has
been
ever
since
carefully
preserved
in
our
family
there
is
a
prophecy
about
it
but
i
hold
it
not
worthy
of
remark
philipson
was
about
to
inquire
further
but
was
interrupted
by
a
loud
cry
of
surprise
and
astonishment
from
without
i
must
out
said
biederman
and
see
what
these
wild
lads
are
doing
it
is
not
now
as
formerly
in
this
land
when
the
young
dared
not
judge
for
themselves
till
the
old
man
voice
had
been
heard
he
went
forth
from
the
lodge
followed
by
his
guest
the
company
who
had
witnessed
the
games
were
all
talking
shouting
and
disputing
in
the
same
breath
while
arthur
philipson
stood
a
little
apart
from
the
rest
leaning
on
the
unbent
bow
with
apparent
indifference
at
the
sight
of
the
landamman
all
were
silent
what
means
this
unwonted
clamour
he
said
raising
a
voice
to
which
all
were
accustomed
to
listen
with
rudiger
addressing
the
eldest
of
his
sons
has
the
young
stranger
bent
the
bow
he
has
father
said
rudiger
and
he
has
hit
the
mark
three
such
shots
were
never
shot
by
william
tell
it
was
chance
pure
chance
said
the
young
swiss
from
berne
no
human
skill
could
have
done
it
much
less
a
puny
lad
baffled
in
all
besides
that
he
attempted
among
us
but
what
been
done
said
the
nay
speak
not
all
at
once
anne
of
geierstein
thou
hast
more
sense
and
breeding
than
these
boys
tell
me
how
the
game
has
gone
the
maiden
seemed
a
little
confused
at
this
appeal
but
answered
with
a
composed
and
downcast
look
the
mark
was
as
usual
a
pigeon
to
a
pole
all
the
young
men
except
the
stranger
had
practised
at
it
with
the
and
without
hitting
it
when
i
brought
out
the
bow
of
buttisholz
i
offered
it
first
to
my
kinsmen
none
would
accept
of
it
saying
respected
uncle
that
a
task
too
great
for
you
must
be
far
too
difficult
for
them
they
said
well
answered
arnold
biederman
and
the
stranger
did
he
string
the
bow
he
did
my
uncle
but
first
he
wrote
something
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
placed
it
in
my
hands
and
did
he
shoot
and
hit
the
mark
continued
the
surprised
switzer
he
first
said
the
maiden
removed
the
pole
a
hundred
yards
farther
than
the
post
where
it
stood
singular
said
the
landamman
that
is
double
the
usual
distance
he
then
drew
the
bow
continued
the
maiden
and
shot
off
one
after
another
with
incredible
rapidity
the
three
arrows
which
he
had
stuck
into
his
belt
the
first
cleft
the
pole
the
second
cut
the
string
the
third
killed
the
poor
bird
as
it
rose
into
the
air
by
mary
of
einsiedlen
said
the
old
man
looking
up
in
amaze
if
your
eyes
really
saw
this
they
saw
such
archery
as
was
never
before
witnessed
in
the
forest
states
i
say
nay
to
that
my
revered
kinsman
replied
rudolph
donnerhugel
whose
vexation
was
apparent
it
was
mere
chance
if
not
illusion
or
witchery
what
thou
of
it
thyself
arthur
said
his
father
half
smiling
was
thy
success
by
chance
or
skill
my
father
said
the
young
man
i
need
not
tell
you
that
i
have
done
but
an
ordinary
feat
for
an
english
bowman
nor
do
i
speak
to
gratify
that
misproud
and
ignorant
young
man
but
to
our
worthy
host
and
his
family
i
make
answer
this
youth
charges
me
with
having
deluded
eyes
or
hit
the
mark
by
chance
for
illusion
yonder
is
the
pierced
pole
the
severed
string
and
the
slain
bird
they
will
endure
sight
and
handling
and
besides
if
that
fair
maiden
will
open
the
note
which
i
put
into
her
hand
she
will
find
evidence
to
assure
you
that
even
before
i
drew
the
bow
i
had
fixed
upon
the
three
marks
which
i
designed
to
aim
at
produce
the
scroll
good
niece
said
her
uncle
and
end
the
controversy
nay
under
your
favour
my
worthy
host
said
arthur
it
is
but
some
foolish
rhymes
addressed
to
the
maiden
own
eye
and
under
your
favour
sir
said
the
landamman
whatsoever
is
fit
for
my
niece
eyes
may
greet
my
ears
he
took
the
scroll
from
the
maiden
who
blushed
deeply
when
she
resigned
it
the
character
in
which
it
was
written
was
so
fine
that
the
landamman
in
surprise
exclaimed
no
clerk
of
gall
could
have
written
more
strange
he
again
repeated
that
a
hand
which
could
draw
so
true
a
bow
should
have
the
cunning
to
form
characters
so
fair
he
then
exclaimed
anew
ha
verses
by
our
lady
what
have
we
minstrels
disguised
as
traders
he
then
opened
the
scroll
and
read
the
following
lines
if
i
hit
mast
and
line
and
bird
an
english
archer
keeps
his
word
ah
maiden
didst
thou
aim
at
me
a
single
glance
were
worth
the
three
here
is
rare
rhyming
my
worthy
guest
said
the
landamman
shaking
his
head
fine
words
to
make
foolish
maidens
fain
but
do
not
excuse
it
it
is
your
and
we
know
how
to
treat
it
as
such
and
without
further
allusion
to
the
concluding
couplet
the
reading
of
which
threw
the
poet
as
well
as
the
object
of
the
verses
into
some
discomposure
he
added
gravely
you
must
now
allow
rudolph
donnerhugel
that
the
stranger
has
fairly
attained
the
three
marks
which
he
proposed
to
himself
that
he
has
attained
them
is
plain
answered
the
party
to
whom
the
appeal
was
made
but
that
he
has
done
this
fairly
may
be
doubted
if
there
are
such
things
as
witchery
and
magic
in
this
world
shame
shame
rudolph
said
the
landamman
can
spleen
and
envy
have
weight
with
so
brave
a
man
as
you
from
whom
my
sons
ought
to
learn
temperance
forbearance
and
candour
as
well
as
manly
courage
and
dexterity
the
bernese
coloured
high
under
this
rebuke
to
which
he
ventured
not
to
attempt
a
reply
to
your
sports
till
sunset
my
children
continued
arnold
while
i
and
my
worthy
friend
occupy
our
time
with
a
walk
for
which
the
evening
is
now
favourable
methinks
said
the
english
merchant
i
should
like
to
visit
the
ruins
of
yonder
castle
situated
by
the
waterfall
there
is
something
of
melancholy
dignity
in
such
a
scene
which
reconciles
us
to
the
misfortunes
of
our
own
time
by
showing
that
our
ancestors
who
were
perhaps
more
intelligent
or
more
powerful
have
nevertheless
in
their
days
encountered
cares
and
distresses
similar
to
those
which
we
now
groan
under
have
with
you
my
worthy
sir
replied
his
host
there
will
be
time
also
upon
the
road
to
talk
of
things
that
you
should
know
the
slow
step
of
the
two
elderly
men
carried
them
by
degrees
from
the
limits
of
the
lawn
where
shout
and
laugh
and
halloo
were
again
revived
young
philipson
whose
success
as
an
archer
had
obliterated
all
recollection
of
former
failure
made
other
attempts
to
mingle
in
the
manly
pastimes
of
the
country
and
gained
a
considerable
portion
of
applause
the
young
men
who
had
but
lately
been
so
ready
to
join
in
ridiculing
him
now
began
to
consider
him
as
a
person
to
be
looked
up
and
appealed
to
while
rudolph
donnerhugel
saw
with
resentment
that
he
was
no
longer
without
a
rival
in
the
opinion
of
his
male
cousins
perhaps
of
his
kinswoman
also
the
proud
young
swiss
reflected
with
bitterness
that
he
had
fallen
under
the
landamman
displeasure
declined
in
reputation
with
his
companions
of
whom
he
had
been
hitherto
the
leader
and
even
hazarded
a
more
mortifying
disappointment
all
as
his
swelling
heart
expressed
it
through
the
means
of
a
stranger
stripling
of
neither
blood
nor
fame
who
could
not
step
from
one
rock
to
another
without
the
encouragement
of
a
girl
in
this
irritated
mood
he
drew
near
the
young
englishman
and
while
he
seemed
to
address
him
on
the
chances
of
the
sports
which
were
still
proceeding
he
conveyed
in
a
whisper
matter
of
a
far
different
tendency
striking
arthur
shoulder
with
the
frank
bluntness
of
a
mountaineer
he
said
aloud
yonder
bolt
of
ernest
whistled
through
the
air
like
a
falcon
when
she
stoops
down
the
wind
and
then
proceeded
in
a
deep
low
voice
you
merchants
sell
gloves
do
you
ever
deal
in
single
gauntlets
or
only
in
pairs
i
no
single
glove
said
arthur
instantly
apprehending
him
and
sufficiently
disposed
to
resent
the
scornful
looks
of
the
bernese
champion
during
the
time
of
their
meal
and
his
having
but
lately
imputed
his
successful
shooting
to
chance
or
sorcery
i
no
single
glove
sir
but
never
refuse
to
exchange
one
you
are
apt
i
see
said
rudolph
look
at
the
players
while
i
speak
or
our
purpose
will
be
you
are
quicker
i
say
of
apprehension
than
i
expected
if
we
exchange
our
gloves
how
shall
each
redeem
his
own
with
our
good
swords
said
arthur
philipson
in
armour
or
as
we
stand
even
as
we
stand
said
arthur
i
have
no
better
garment
of
proof
than
this
doublet
no
other
weapon
than
my
sword
and
these
sir
switzer
i
hold
enough
for
the
name
time
and
place
the
old
at
geierstein
replied
rudolph
the
time
sunrise
but
we
are
i
have
lost
my
wager
stranger
he
added
speaking
aloud
and
in
an
indifferent
tone
of
voice
since
ulrick
has
made
a
cast
beyond
there
is
my
glove
in
token
i
shall
not
forget
the
flask
of
wine
and
there
is
mine
said
arthur
in
token
i
will
drink
it
with
you
merrily
thus
amid
the
peaceful
though
rough
sports
of
their
companions
did
these
two
youths
contrive
to
indulge
their
hostile
inclinations
towards
each
other
by
settling
a
meeting
of
deadly
purpose
chapter
i
was
one
who
loved
the
greenwood
bank
and
lowing
herd
the
russet
prize
the
lowly
peasant
life
season
with
sweet
content
more
than
the
halls
where
revellers
feast
to
believe
me
there
was
poison
mix
in
maple
bowl
anonymous
leaving
the
young
persons
engaged
with
their
sports
the
landamman
of
unterwalden
and
the
elder
philipson
walked
on
in
company
conversing
chiefly
on
the
political
relations
of
france
england
and
burgundy
until
the
conversation
was
changed
as
they
entered
the
gate
of
the
old
of
geierstein
where
arose
the
lonely
and
dismantled
keep
surrounded
by
the
ruins
of
other
buildings
this
has
been
a
proud
and
a
strong
habitation
in
its
time
said
philipson
they
were
a
proud
and
powerful
race
who
held
it
replied
the
landamman
the
counts
of
geierstein
have
a
history
which
runs
back
to
the
times
of
the
old
helvetians
and
their
deeds
are
reported
to
have
matched
their
antiquity
but
all
earthly
grandeur
has
an
end
and
free
men
tread
the
ruins
of
their
feudal
castle
at
the
most
distant
sight
of
whose
turrets
serfs
were
formerly
obliged
to
vail
their
bonnets
if
they
would
escape
the
chastisement
of
contumacious
rebels
i
observe
said
the
merchant
engraved
on
a
stone
under
yonder
turret
the
crest
i
conceive
of
the
last
family
a
vulture
perched
on
a
rock
descriptive
doubtless
of
the
word
geierstein
it
is
the
ancient
cognisance
of
the
family
replied
arnold
biederman
and
as
you
say
expresses
the
name
of
the
castle
being
the
same
with
that
of
the
knights
who
so
long
held
it
i
also
remarked
in
your
hall
continued
the
merchant
a
helmet
bearing
the
same
crest
or
cognisance
it
is
i
suppose
a
trophy
of
the
triumph
of
the
swiss
peasants
over
the
nobles
of
geierstein
as
the
english
bow
is
preserved
in
remembrance
of
the
battle
of
buttisholz
and
you
fair
sir
replied
the
landamman
would
i
perceive
from
the
prejudices
of
your
education
regard
the
one
victory
with
as
unpleasant
feelings
as
the
other
strange
that
the
veneration
for
rank
should
be
rooted
even
in
the
minds
of
those
who
have
no
claim
to
share
it
but
clear
up
your
downcast
brows
my
worthy
guest
and
be
assured
that
though
many
a
proud
baron
castle
when
switzerland
threw
off
the
bonds
of
feudal
slavery
was
plundered
and
destroyed
by
the
just
vengeance
of
an
incensed
people
such
was
not
the
lot
of
geierstein
the
blood
of
the
old
possessors
of
these
towers
still
flows
in
the
veins
of
him
by
whom
these
lands
are
occupied
what
am
i
to
understand
by
that
sir
landamman
said
philipson
are
not
you
yourself
the
occupant
of
this
place
and
you
think
probably
answered
arnold
because
i
live
like
the
other
shepherds
wear
homespun
grey
and
hold
the
plough
with
my
own
hands
i
can
not
be
descended
from
a
line
of
ancient
nobility
this
land
holds
many
such
gentle
peasants
sir
merchant
nor
is
there
a
more
ancient
nobility
than
that
of
which
the
remains
are
to
be
found
in
my
native
country
but
they
have
voluntarily
resigned
the
oppressive
part
of
their
feudal
power
and
are
no
longer
regarded
as
wolves
amongst
the
flock
but
as
sagacious
mastiffs
who
attend
the
sheep
in
time
of
peace
and
are
prompt
in
their
defence
when
war
threatens
our
community
but
repeated
the
merchant
who
could
not
yet
reconcile
himself
to
the
idea
that
his
plain
and
host
was
a
man
of
distinguished
birth
you
bear
not
the
name
worthy
sir
of
your
fathers
they
were
you
say
the
counts
of
geierstein
and
you
are
arnold
biederman
at
your
command
answered
the
magistrate
but
know
if
the
knowledge
can
make
you
sup
with
more
sense
of
dignity
or
comfort
i
need
but
put
on
yonder
old
helmet
or
if
that
were
too
much
trouble
i
have
only
to
stick
a
falcon
feather
into
my
cap
and
call
myself
arnold
count
of
geierstein
no
man
could
gainsay
me
though
whether
it
would
become
my
lord
count
to
drive
his
bullocks
to
the
pasture
and
whether
his
excellency
the
high
and
could
without
derogation
sow
a
field
or
reap
it
are
questions
which
should
be
settled
beforehand
i
see
you
are
confounded
my
respected
guest
at
my
degeneracy
but
the
state
of
my
family
is
very
soon
explained
my
lordly
fathers
ruled
this
same
domain
of
geierstein
which
in
their
time
was
very
extensive
much
after
the
mode
of
feudal
barons
that
is
they
were
sometimes
the
protectors
and
patrons
but
oftener
the
oppressors
of
their
subjects
but
when
my
grandfather
heinrich
of
geierstein
flourished
he
not
only
joined
the
confederates
to
repel
ingelram
de
couci
and
his
roving
bands
as
i
already
told
you
but
when
the
wars
with
austria
were
renewed
and
many
of
his
degree
joined
with
the
host
of
the
emperor
leopold
my
ancestor
adopted
the
opposite
side
fought
in
front
of
the
confederates
and
contributed
by
his
skill
and
valour
to
the
decisive
victory
at
sempach
in
which
leopold
lost
his
life
and
the
flower
of
austrian
chivalry
fell
around
him
my
father
count
williewald
followed
the
same
course
both
from
inclination
and
policy
he
united
himself
closely
with
the
state
of
unterwalden
became
a
citizen
of
the
confederacy
and
distinguished
himself
so
much
that
he
was
chosen
landamman
of
the
republic
he
had
two
sons
myself
and
a
younger
brother
albert
and
possessed
as
he
felt
himself
of
a
species
of
double
character
he
was
desirous
perhaps
unwisely
if
i
may
censure
the
purpose
of
a
deceased
parent
that
one
of
his
sons
should
succeed
him
in
his
lordship
of
geierstein
and
the
other
support
the
less
ostentatious
though
not
in
my
thought
less
honourable
condition
of
a
free
citizen
of
unterwalden
possessing
such
influence
among
his
equals
in
the
canton
as
might
be
acquired
by
his
father
merits
and
his
own
when
albert
was
twelve
years
old
our
father
took
us
on
a
short
excursion
to
germany
where
the
form
pomp
and
magnificence
which
we
witnessed
made
a
very
different
impression
on
the
mind
of
my
brother
and
on
my
own
what
appeared
to
albert
the
consummation
of
earthly
splendour
seemed
to
me
a
weary
display
of
tiresome
and
useless
ceremonials
our
father
explained
his
purpose
and
offered
to
me
as
his
eldest
son
the
large
estate
belonging
to
geierstein
reserving
such
a
portion
of
the
most
fertile
ground
as
might
make
my
brother
one
of
the
wealthiest
citizens
in
a
district
where
competence
is
esteemed
wealth
the
tears
gushed
from
albert
eyes
must
my
brother
he
said
a
noble
count
honoured
and
followed
by
vassals
and
attendants
and
i
a
homespun
peasant
among
the
shepherds
of
unterwalden
no
father
i
respect
your
will
but
i
will
not
sacrifice
my
own
rights
geierstein
is
a
fief
held
of
the
empire
and
the
laws
entitle
me
to
my
equal
half
of
the
lands
if
my
brother
be
count
of
geierstein
i
am
not
the
less
count
albert
of
geierstein
and
i
will
appeal
to
the
emperor
rather
than
that
the
arbitrary
will
of
one
ancestor
though
he
be
my
father
shall
cancel
in
me
the
rank
and
rights
which
i
have
derived
from
a
hundred
my
father
was
greatly
incensed
he
said
boy
give
the
enemy
of
thy
country
a
pretext
to
interfere
in
her
affairs
appeal
to
the
will
of
a
foreign
prince
from
the
pleasure
of
thy
father
go
but
never
again
look
me
in
the
face
and
dread
my
eternal
malediction
albert
was
about
to
reply
with
vehemence
when
i
entreated
him
to
be
silent
and
hear
me
speak
i
had
i
said
all
my
life
loved
the
mountain
better
than
the
plain
had
been
more
pleased
to
walk
than
to
ride
more
proud
to
contend
with
shepherds
in
their
sports
than
with
nobles
in
the
lists
and
happier
in
the
village
dance
than
among
the
feasts
of
the
german
nobles
me
therefore
i
said
a
citizen
of
the
republic
of
unterwalden
you
will
relieve
me
of
a
thousand
cares
and
let
my
brother
albert
wear
the
coronet
and
bear
the
honours
of
geierstein
after
some
further
discussion
my
father
was
at
length
contented
to
adopt
my
proposal
in
order
to
attain
the
object
which
he
had
so
much
at
heart
albert
was
declared
heir
of
his
castle
and
his
rank
by
the
title
of
count
albert
of
geierstein
and
i
was
placed
in
possession
of
these
fields
and
fertile
meadows
amidst
which
my
house
is
situated
and
my
neighbours
called
me
arnold
biederman
and
if
biederman
said
the
merchant
means
as
i
understand
the
word
a
man
of
worth
candour
and
generosity
i
know
none
on
whom
the
epithet
could
be
so
justly
conferred
yet
let
me
observe
that
i
praise
the
conduct
which
in
your
circumstances
i
could
not
have
bowed
my
spirit
to
practise
proceed
i
pray
you
with
the
history
of
your
house
if
the
recital
be
not
painful
to
you
i
have
little
more
to
say
replied
the
landamman
my
father
died
soon
after
the
settlement
of
his
estate
in
the
manner
i
have
told
you
my
brother
had
other
possessions
in
swabia
and
westphalia
and
seldom
visited
his
paternal
castle
which
was
chiefly
occupied
by
a
seneschal
a
man
so
obnoxious
to
the
vassals
of
the
family
that
but
for
the
protection
afforded
by
my
near
residence
and
relationship
with
his
lord
he
would
have
been
plucked
out
of
the
vulture
nest
and
treated
with
as
little
ceremony
as
if
he
had
been
the
vulture
himself
neither
to
say
the
truth
did
my
brother
occasional
visits
to
geierstein
afford
his
vassals
much
relief
or
acquire
any
popularity
for
himself
he
heard
with
the
ears
and
saw
with
the
eyes
of
his
cruel
and
interested
steward
ital
schreckenwald
and
would
not
listen
even
to
my
interference
and
admonition
indeed
though
he
always
demeaned
himself
with
personal
kindness
towards
me
i
believe
he
considered
me
as
a
dull
and
clown
who
had
disgraced
my
noble
blood
by
my
mean
propensities
he
showed
contempt
on
every
occasion
for
the
prejudices
of
his
countrymen
and
particularly
by
wearing
a
peacock
feather
in
public
and
causing
his
followers
to
display
the
same
badge
though
the
cognisance
of
the
house
of
austria
and
so
unpopular
in
this
country
that
men
have
been
put
to
death
for
no
better
reason
than
for
carrying
it
in
their
caps
in
the
meantime
i
was
married
to
my
bertha
now
a
saint
in
heaven
by
whom
i
had
six
stately
sons
five
of
whom
you
saw
surrounding
my
table
this
day
albert
also
married
his
wife
was
a
lady
of
rank
in
westphalia
but
his
was
less
fruitful
he
had
only
one
daughter
anne
of
geierstein
then
came
on
the
wars
between
the
city
of
zurich
and
our
forest
cantons
in
which
so
much
blood
was
shed
and
when
our
brethren
of
zurich
were
so
ill
advised
as
to
embrace
the
alliance
of
austria
their
emperor
strained
every
nerve
to
avail
himself
of
the
favourable
opportunity
afforded
by
the
disunion
of
the
swiss
and
engaged
all
with
whom
he
had
influence
to
second
his
efforts
with
my
brother
he
was
but
too
successful
for
albert
not
only
took
arms
in
the
cause
but
admitted
into
the
strong
fortress
of
geierstein
a
band
of
austrian
soldiers
with
whom
the
wicked
ital
schreckenwald
laid
waste
the
whole
country
excepting
my
little
patrimony
it
came
to
a
severe
pass
with
you
my
worthy
host
said
the
merchant
since
you
were
to
decide
against
the
cause
of
your
country
or
that
of
your
brother
i
did
not
hesitate
continued
arnold
biederman
my
brother
was
in
the
emperor
army
and
i
was
not
therefore
reduced
to
act
personally
against
him
but
i
denounced
war
against
the
robbers
and
thieves
with
whom
schreckenwald
had
filled
my
father
house
it
was
waged
with
various
fortune
the
seneschal
during
my
absence
burnt
down
my
house
and
slew
my
youngest
son
who
died
alas
in
defence
of
his
father
hearth
it
is
little
to
add
that
my
lands
were
wasted
and
my
flocks
destroyed
on
the
other
hand
i
succeeded
with
help
of
a
body
of
the
peasants
of
unterwalden
in
storming
the
castle
of
geierstein
it
was
offered
back
to
me
by
the
confederates
but
i
had
no
desire
to
sully
the
fair
cause
in
which
i
had
assumed
arms
by
enriching
myself
at
the
expense
of
my
brother
and
besides
to
have
dwelt
in
that
guarded
hold
would
have
been
a
penance
to
one
the
sole
protectors
of
whose
house
of
late
years
had
been
a
latch
and
a
shepherd
cur
the
castle
was
therefore
dismantled
as
you
see
by
order
of
the
elders
of
the
canton
and
i
even
think
that
considering
the
uses
it
was
too
often
put
to
i
look
with
more
pleasure
on
the
rugged
remains
of
geierstein
than
i
ever
did
when
it
was
entire
and
apparently
impregnable
i
can
understand
your
feelings
said
the
englishman
though
i
repeat
my
virtue
would
not
perhaps
have
extended
so
far
beyond
the
circle
of
my
family
your
brother
what
said
he
to
your
patriotic
exertions
he
was
as
i
learnt
answered
the
landamman
dreadfully
incensed
having
no
doubt
been
informed
that
i
had
taken
his
castle
with
a
view
to
my
own
aggrandisement
he
even
swore
he
would
renounce
my
kindred
seek
me
through
the
battle
and
slay
me
with
his
own
hand
we
were
in
fact
both
at
the
battle
of
freyenbach
but
my
brother
was
prevented
from
attempting
the
execution
of
his
vindictive
purpose
by
a
wound
from
an
arrow
which
occasioned
his
being
carried
out
of
the
mêlée
i
was
afterwards
in
the
bloody
and
melancholy
fight
at
and
that
other
onslaught
at
the
chapel
of
jacob
which
brought
our
brethren
of
zurich
to
terms
and
reduced
austria
once
more
to
the
necessity
of
making
peace
with
us
after
this
war
of
thirteen
years
the
diet
passed
sentence
of
banishment
for
life
on
my
brother
albert
and
would
have
deprived
him
of
his
possessions
but
forbore
in
consideration
of
what
they
thought
my
good
service
when
the
sentence
was
intimated
to
the
count
of
geierstein
he
returned
an
answer
of
defiance
yet
a
singular
circumstance
showed
us
not
long
afterwards
that
he
retained
an
attachment
to
his
country
and
amidst
his
resentment
against
me
his
brother
did
justice
to
my
unaltered
affection
for
him
i
would
pledge
my
credit
said
the
merchant
that
what
follows
relates
to
yonder
fair
maiden
your
niece
you
guess
rightly
said
the
landamman
for
some
time
we
heard
though
indistinctly
for
we
have
as
you
know
but
little
communication
with
foreign
countries
that
my
brother
was
high
in
favour
at
the
court
of
the
emperor
but
latterly
that
he
had
fallen
under
suspicion
and
in
the
course
of
some
of
those
revolutions
common
at
the
courts
of
princes
had
been
driven
into
exile
it
was
shortly
after
this
news
and
as
i
think
more
than
seven
years
ago
that
i
was
returning
from
hunting
on
the
farther
side
of
the
river
had
passed
the
narrow
bridge
as
usual
and
was
walking
through
the
courtyard
which
we
have
lately
left
for
their
walk
was
now
turned
homeward
when
a
voice
said
in
the
german
language
have
compassion
upon
me
as
i
looked
around
i
beheld
a
girl
of
ten
years
old
approach
timidly
from
the
shelter
of
the
ruins
and
kneel
down
at
my
feet
spare
my
life
she
said
holding
up
her
little
hands
in
the
act
of
supplication
while
mortal
terror
was
painted
upon
her
i
your
uncle
little
maiden
said
i
if
i
am
why
should
you
fear
me
you
are
the
head
of
the
wicked
and
base
clowns
who
delight
to
spill
noble
blood
replied
the
girl
with
a
courage
which
surprised
is
your
name
my
little
maiden
said
i
who
having
planted
in
your
mind
opinions
so
unfavourable
to
your
kinsman
has
brought
you
hither
to
see
if
he
resembles
the
picture
you
have
received
of
him
was
ital
schreckenwald
that
brought
me
hither
said
the
girl
only
half
comprehending
the
nature
of
my
schreckenwald
i
repeated
shocked
at
the
name
of
a
wretch
i
have
so
much
reason
to
hate
a
voice
from
the
ruins
like
that
of
a
sullen
echo
from
the
grave
answered
schreckenwald
and
the
caitiff
issued
from
his
place
of
concealment
and
stood
before
me
with
that
singular
indifference
to
danger
which
he
unites
to
his
atrocity
of
character
i
had
my
spiked
in
my
hand
what
should
i
have
done
or
what
would
you
have
done
under
like
circumstances
i
would
have
laid
him
on
the
earth
with
his
skull
shivered
like
an
icicle
said
the
englishman
fiercely
i
had
done
so
replied
the
swiss
but
he
was
unarmed
a
messenger
from
my
brother
and
therefore
no
object
of
revenge
his
own
undismayed
and
audacious
conduct
contributed
to
save
him
the
vassal
of
the
noble
and
count
of
geierstein
hear
the
words
of
his
master
and
let
him
look
that
they
are
obeyed
said
the
insolent
ruffian
thy
cap
and
listen
for
though
the
voice
is
mine
the
words
are
those
of
the
noble
count
and
man
know
replied
i
i
owe
my
brother
respect
or
homage
it
is
much
if
in
respect
for
him
i
defer
paying
to
his
messenger
the
meed
i
dearly
owe
him
proceed
with
thy
tale
and
rid
me
of
thy
hateful
presence
count
of
geierstein
thy
lord
and
my
lord
proceeded
schreckenwald
on
his
hand
wars
and
other
affairs
of
weight
sends
his
daughter
the
countess
anne
to
thy
charge
and
graces
thee
so
far
as
to
intrust
to
thee
her
support
and
nurture
until
it
shall
suit
his
purposes
to
require
her
back
from
thee
and
he
desires
that
thou
apply
to
her
maintenance
the
rents
and
profits
of
the
lands
of
geierstein
which
thou
hast
usurped
from
him
schreckenwald
i
replied
will
not
stop
to
ask
if
this
mode
of
addressing
me
be
according
to
my
brother
directions
or
thine
own
insolent
pleasure
if
circumstances
have
as
thou
sayest
deprived
my
niece
of
her
natural
protector
i
will
be
to
her
as
a
father
nor
shall
she
want
aught
which
i
have
to
give
her
the
lands
of
geierstein
are
forfeited
to
the
state
the
castle
is
ruinous
as
thou
seest
and
it
is
much
of
thy
crimes
that
the
house
of
my
fathers
is
desolate
but
where
i
dwell
anne
of
geierstein
shall
dwell
as
my
children
fare
shall
she
fare
and
she
shall
be
to
me
as
a
daughter
and
now
thou
hast
thine
errand
go
hence
if
thou
lovest
thy
life
for
it
is
unsafe
parleying
with
the
father
when
thy
hands
are
stained
with
the
blood
of
the
son
the
wretch
retired
as
i
spoke
but
took
his
leave
with
his
usual
determined
insolence
of
he
said
of
the
plough
and
harrow
farewell
noble
companion
of
paltry
burghers
he
disappeared
and
released
me
from
the
strong
temptation
under
which
i
laboured
and
which
urged
me
to
stain
with
his
blood
the
place
which
had
witnessed
his
cruelty
and
his
crimes
i
conveyed
my
niece
to
my
house
and
soon
convinced
her
that
i
was
her
sincere
friend
i
inured
her
as
if
she
had
been
my
daughter
to
all
our
mountain
exercises
and
while
she
excels
in
these
the
damsels
of
the
district
there
burst
from
her
such
sparkles
of
sense
and
courage
mingled
with
delicacy
as
belong
not
i
must
needs
own
the
truth
to
the
simple
maidens
of
these
wild
hills
but
relish
of
a
nobler
stem
and
higher
breeding
yet
they
are
so
happily
mixed
with
simplicity
and
courtesy
that
anne
of
geierstein
is
justly
considered
as
the
pride
of
the
district
nor
do
i
doubt
but
that
if
she
should
make
a
worthy
choice
of
a
husband
the
state
would
assign
her
a
large
dower
out
of
her
father
possessions
since
it
is
not
our
maxim
to
punish
the
child
for
the
faults
of
the
parent
it
will
naturally
be
your
anxious
desire
my
worthy
host
replied
the
englishman
to
secure
to
your
niece
in
whose
praises
i
have
deep
cause
to
join
with
a
grateful
voice
such
a
suitable
match
as
her
birth
and
expectations
but
above
all
her
merit
demand
it
is
my
good
guest
said
the
landamman
that
which
hath
often
occupied
my
thoughts
the
relationship
prohibits
what
would
have
been
my
most
earnest
desire
the
hope
of
seeing
her
wedded
to
one
of
my
own
sons
this
young
man
rudolph
donnerhugel
is
brave
and
highly
esteemed
by
his
but
more
ambitious
and
more
desirous
of
distinction
than
i
would
desire
for
my
niece
companion
through
life
his
temper
is
violent
though
his
heart
i
trust
is
good
but
i
am
like
to
be
unpleasantly
released
from
all
care
on
this
score
since
my
brother
having
as
it
seemed
forgotten
anne
for
seven
years
and
upwards
has
by
a
letter
which
i
have
lately
received
demanded
that
she
shall
be
restored
to
you
can
read
my
worthy
sir
for
your
profession
requires
it
see
here
is
the
scroll
coldly
worded
but
far
less
unkindly
than
his
unbrotherly
message
by
ital
schreckenwald
read
it
i
pray
you
aloud
the
merchant
read
accordingly
brother
i
thank
you
for
the
care
you
have
taken
of
my
daughter
for
she
has
been
in
safety
when
she
would
otherwise
have
been
in
peril
and
kindly
used
when
she
would
have
been
in
hardship
i
now
entreat
you
to
restore
her
to
me
and
trust
that
she
will
come
with
the
virtues
which
become
a
woman
in
every
station
and
a
disposition
to
lay
aside
the
habits
of
a
swiss
villager
for
the
graces
of
a
adieu
i
thank
you
once
more
for
your
care
and
would
repay
it
were
it
in
my
power
but
you
need
nothing
i
can
give
having
renounced
the
rank
to
which
you
were
born
and
made
your
nest
on
the
ground
where
the
storm
passes
over
you
i
rest
your
brother
geierstein
it
is
addressed
count
arnold
of
geierstein
called
arnold
biederman
a
postscript
requires
you
to
send
the
maiden
to
the
court
of
the
duke
of
this
good
sir
appears
to
me
the
language
of
a
haughty
man
divided
betwixt
the
recollection
of
old
offence
and
recent
obligation
the
speech
of
his
messenger
was
that
of
a
malicious
vassal
desirous
of
venting
his
own
spite
under
pretence
of
doing
his
lord
errand
i
so
receive
both
replied
arnold
biederman
and
do
you
intend
continued
the
merchant
to
resign
this
beautiful
and
interesting
creature
to
the
conduct
of
her
father
wilful
as
he
seems
to
be
without
knowing
what
his
condition
is
or
what
his
power
of
protecting
her
the
landamman
hastened
to
reply
the
tie
which
unites
the
parent
to
the
child
is
the
earliest
and
the
most
hallowed
that
binds
the
human
race
the
difficulty
of
her
travelling
in
safety
has
hitherto
prevented
my
attempting
to
carry
my
brother
instructions
into
execution
but
as
i
am
now
likely
to
journey
in
person
towards
the
court
of
charles
i
have
determined
that
anne
shall
accompany
me
and
as
i
will
myself
converse
with
my
brother
whom
i
have
not
seen
for
many
years
i
shall
learn
his
purpose
respecting
his
daughter
and
it
may
be
i
may
prevail
on
albert
to
suffer
her
to
remain
under
my
and
now
sir
having
told
you
of
my
family
affairs
at
some
greater
length
than
was
necessary
i
must
crave
your
attention
as
a
wise
man
to
what
further
i
have
to
say
you
know
the
disposition
which
young
men
and
women
naturally
have
to
talk
jest
and
sport
with
each
other
out
of
which
practice
arise
often
more
serious
attachments
which
they
call
loving
i
trust
if
we
are
to
travel
together
you
will
so
school
your
young
man
as
to
make
him
aware
that
anne
of
geierstein
can
not
with
propriety
on
her
part
be
made
the
object
of
his
thoughts
or
attentions
the
merchant
coloured
with
resentment
or
something
like
it
i
asked
not
to
join
your
company
sir
landamman
it
was
you
who
requested
mine
he
said
if
my
son
and
i
have
since
become
in
any
respect
the
objects
of
your
suspicion
we
will
gladly
pursue
our
way
separately
nay
be
not
angry
worthy
guest
said
the
landamman
we
switzers
do
not
rashly
harbour
suspicions
and
that
we
may
not
harbour
them
we
speak
respecting
the
circumstances
out
of
which
they
might
arise
more
plainly
than
is
the
wont
of
more
civilised
countries
when
i
proposed
to
you
to
be
my
companion
on
the
journey
to
speak
the
truth
though
it
may
displease
a
father
ear
i
regarded
your
son
as
a
soft
youth
who
was
as
yet
at
least
too
timid
and
to
attract
either
respect
or
regard
from
the
maidens
but
a
few
hours
have
presented
him
to
us
in
the
character
of
such
a
one
as
is
sure
to
interest
them
he
has
accomplished
the
emprise
of
the
bow
long
thought
unattainable
and
with
which
a
popular
report
connects
an
idle
prophecy
he
has
wit
to
make
verses
and
knows
doubtless
how
to
recommend
himself
by
other
accomplishments
which
bind
young
persons
to
each
other
though
they
are
lightly
esteemed
by
men
whose
beards
are
mixed
with
grey
like
yours
friend
merchant
and
mine
own
now
you
must
be
aware
that
since
my
brother
broke
terms
with
me
simply
for
preferring
the
freedom
of
a
swiss
citizen
to
the
tawdry
and
servile
condition
of
a
german
courtier
he
will
not
approve
of
any
one
looking
towards
his
daughter
who
hath
not
the
advantage
of
noble
blood
or
who
hath
what
he
would
call
debased
himself
by
attention
to
merchandise
to
the
cultivation
of
land
in
a
word
to
any
art
that
is
useful
should
your
son
love
anne
of
geierstein
he
prepares
for
himself
danger
and
disappointment
and
now
you
know
the
whole
i
ask
you
do
we
travel
together
or
apart
even
as
ye
list
my
worthy
host
said
philipson
in
an
indifferent
tone
for
me
i
can
but
say
that
such
an
attachment
as
you
speak
of
would
be
as
contrary
to
my
wishes
as
to
those
of
your
brother
or
what
i
suppose
are
your
own
arthur
philipson
has
duties
to
perform
totally
inconsistent
with
his
playing
the
gentle
bachelor
to
any
maiden
in
switzerland
take
germany
to
boot
whether
of
high
or
low
degree
he
is
an
obedient
son
besides
hath
never
seriously
disobeyed
my
commands
and
i
will
have
an
eye
upon
his
motions
enough
my
friend
said
the
landamman
we
travel
together
then
and
i
willingly
keep
my
original
purpose
being
both
pleased
and
instructed
by
your
discourse
then
changing
the
conversation
he
began
to
ask
whether
his
acquaintance
thought
that
the
league
entered
into
by
the
king
of
england
and
the
duke
of
burgundy
would
continue
stable
we
hear
much
continued
the
swiss
of
the
immense
army
with
which
king
edward
proposes
the
recovery
of
the
english
dominions
in
france
i
am
well
aware
said
philipson
that
nothing
can
be
so
popular
in
my
country
as
the
invasion
of
france
and
the
attempt
to
reconquer
normandy
maine
and
gascony
the
ancient
appanages
of
our
english
crown
but
i
greatly
doubt
whether
the
voluptuous
usurper
who
now
calls
himself
king
will
be
graced
by
heaven
with
success
in
such
an
adventure
this
fourth
edward
is
brave
indeed
and
has
gained
every
battle
in
which
he
drew
his
sword
and
they
have
been
many
in
number
but
since
he
reached
through
a
bloody
path
to
the
summit
of
his
ambition
he
has
shown
himself
rather
a
sensual
debauchee
than
a
valiant
knight
and
it
is
my
firm
belief
that
not
even
the
chance
of
recovering
all
the
fair
dominions
which
were
lost
during
the
civil
wars
excited
by
his
ambitious
house
will
tempt
him
to
exchange
the
soft
beds
of
london
with
sheets
of
silk
and
pillows
of
down
and
the
music
of
a
dying
lute
to
lull
him
to
rest
for
the
turf
of
france
and
the
réveille
of
an
alarm
trumpet
it
is
the
better
for
us
should
it
prove
so
said
the
landamman
for
if
england
and
burgundy
were
to
dismember
france
as
in
our
days
was
nearly
accomplished
duke
charles
would
then
have
leisure
to
exhaust
his
vengeance
against
our
confederacy
as
they
conversed
thus
they
attained
once
more
the
lawn
in
front
of
arnold
biederman
mansion
where
the
contention
of
the
young
men
had
given
place
to
the
dance
performed
by
the
young
persons
of
both
sexes
the
dance
was
led
by
anne
of
geierstein
and
the
youthful
stranger
which
although
it
was
the
most
natural
arrangement
where
the
one
was
a
guest
and
the
other
represented
the
mistress
of
the
family
occasioned
the
landamman
exchanging
a
glance
with
the
elder
philipson
as
if
it
had
held
some
relation
to
the
suspicions
he
had
recently
expressed
but
so
soon
as
her
uncle
and
his
elder
guest
appeared
anne
of
geierstein
took
the
earliest
opportunity
of
a
pause
to
break
off
the
dance
and
to
enter
into
conversation
with
her
kinsman
as
if
on
the
domestic
affairs
under
her
attendance
philipson
observed
that
his
host
listened
seriously
to
his
niece
communication
and
nodding
in
his
frank
manner
seemed
to
intimate
that
her
request
should
receive
a
favourable
consideration
the
family
were
presently
afterwards
summoned
to
attend
the
evening
meal
which
consisted
chiefly
of
the
excellent
fish
afforded
by
the
neighbouring
streams

large
cup
containing
what
was
called

then
went
round
which
was
first
quaffed
by
the
master
of
the
household
then
modestly
tasted
by
the
maiden
next
pledged
by
the
two
strangers
and
finally
emptied
by
the

of

company
such
were
then
the
sober
manners
of
the
swiss
afterwards
much
corrupted
by
their
intercourse
with
more
luxurious
regions
the
guests
were
conducted
to
the
where
philipson
and
young
arthur
occupied
the
same
couch
and
shortly
after
the
whole
inhabitants
of
the
household
were
locked
in
sound
repose
chapter
vi
when
we
two
meet
we
meet
like
rushing
torrents
like
warring
winds
like
flames
from
various
points
that
mate
each
other
fury
there
is
naught
of
elemental
strife
were
fiends
to
guide
it
can
match
the
wrath
of
man
frenaud
the
elder
of
our
two
travellers
though
a
strong
man
and
familiar
with
fatigue
slept
sounder
and
longer
than
usual
on
the
morning
which
was
now
beginning
to
dawn
but
his
son
arthur
had
that
upon
his
mind
which
early
interrupted
his
repose
the
encounter
with
the
bold
switzer
a
chosen
man
of
a
renowned
race
of
warriors
was
an
engagement
which
in
the
opinion
of
the
period
in
which
he
lived
was
not
to
be
delayed
or
broken
he
left
his
side
avoiding
as
much
as
possible
the
risk
of
disturbing
him
though
even
in
that
case
the
circumstance
would
not
have
excited
any
attention
as
he
was
in
the
habit
of
rising
early
in
order
to
make
preparations
for
the
day
journey
to
see
that
the
guide
was
on
his
duty
and
that
the
mule
had
his
provender
and
to
discharge
similar
offices
which
might
otherwise
have
given
trouble
to
his
father
the
old
man
however
fatigued
with
the
exertions
of
the
preceding
day
slept
as
we
have
said
more
soundly
than
his
wont
and
arthur
arming
himself
with
his
good
sword
sallied
out
to
the
lawn
in
front
of
the
landamman
dwelling
amid
the
magic
dawn
of
a
beautiful
harvest
morning
in
the
swiss
mountains
the
sun
was
just
about
to
kiss
the
top
of
the
most
gigantic
of
that
race
of
titans
though
the
long
shadows
still
lay
on
the
rough
grass
which
crisped
under
the
young
man
feet
with
a
strong
intimation
of
frost
but
arthur
looked
not
round
on
the
landscape
however
lovely
which
lay
waiting
one
flash
from
the
orb
of
day
to
start
into
brilliant
existence
he
drew
the
belt
of
his
trusty
sword
which
he
was
in
the
act
of
fastening
when
he
left
the
house
and
ere
he
had
secured
the
buckle
he
was
many
paces
on
his
way
towards
the
place
where
he
was
to
use
it
it
was
still
the
custom
of
that
military
period
to
regard
a
summons
to
combat
as
a
sacred
engagement
preferable
to
all
others
which
could
be
formed
and
stifling
whatever
inward
feelings
of
reluctance
nature
might
oppose
to
the
dictates
of
fashion
the
step
of
a
gallant
to
the
place
of
encounter
was
required
to
be
as
free
and
ready
as
if
he
had
been
going
to
a
bridal
i
do
not
know
whether
this
alacrity
was
altogether
real
on
the
part
of
arthur
philipson
but
if
it
were
otherwise
neither
his
look
nor
pace
betrayed
the
secret
having
hastily
traversed
the
fields
and
groves
which
separated
the
landamman
residence
from
the
old
castle
of
geierstein
he
entered
the
courtyard
from
the
side
where
the
castle
overlooked
the
land
and
nearly
in
the
same
instant
his
almost
gigantic
antagonist
who
looked
yet
more
tall
and
burly
by
the
pale
morning
light
than
he
had
seemed
the
preceding
evening
appeared
ascending
from
the
precarious
bridge
beside
the
torrent
having
reached
geierstein
by
a
different
route
from
that
pursued
by
the
englishman
the
young
champion
of
berne
had
hanging
along
his
back
one
of
those
huge
swords
the
blade
of
which
measured
five
feet
and
which
were
wielded
with
both
hands
these
were
almost
universally
used
by
the
swiss
for
besides
the
impression
which
such
weapons
were
calculated
to
make
upon
the
array
of
the
german
whose
armour
was
impenetrable
to
lighter
swords
they
were
also
well
calculated
to
defend
mountain
passes
where
the
great
bodily
strength
and
agility
of
those
who
bore
them
enabled
the
combatants
in
spite
of
their
weight
and
length
to
use
them
with
much
address
and
effect
one
of
these
gigantic
swords
hung
round
rudolph
donnerhugel
neck
the
point
rattling
against
his
heel
and
the
handle
extending
itself
over
his
left
shoulder
considerably
above
his
head
he
carried
another
in
his
hand
thou
art
punctual
he
called
out
to
arthur
philipson
in
a
voice
which
was
distinctly
heard
above
the
roar
of
the
waterfall
which
it
seemed
to
rival
in
sullen
force
but
i
judged
thou
wouldst
come
without
a
sword
there
is
my
kinsman
ernest
he
said
throwing
on
the
ground
the
weapon
which
he
carried
with
the
hilt
towards
the
young
englishman
look
stranger
that
thou
disgrace
it
not
for
my
kinsman
will
never
forgive
me
if
thou
dost
or
thou
mayst
have
mine
if
thou
likest
it
better
the
englishman
looked
at
the
weapon
with
some
surprise
to
the
use
of
which
he
was
totally
unaccustomed
the
challenger
he
said
in
all
countries
where
honour
is
known
accepts
the
arms
of
the
challenged
he
who
fights
on
a
swiss
mountain
fights
with
a
swiss
brand
answered
rudolph
think
you
our
hands
are
made
to
handle
penknives
nor
are
ours
made
to
wield
scythes
said
arthur
and
muttered
betwixt
his
teeth
as
he
looked
at
the
sword
which
the
swiss
continued
to
offer
him
non
i
have
not
proved
the
weapon
do
you
repent
the
bargain
you
have
made
said
the
swiss
if
so
cry
craven
and
return
in
safety
speak
plainly
instead
of
prattling
latin
like
a
clerk
or
a
shaven
monk
no
proud
man
replied
the
englishman
i
ask
thee
no
forbearance
i
thought
but
of
a
combat
between
a
shepherd
and
a
giant
in
which
god
gave
the
victory
to
him
who
had
worse
odds
of
weapons
than
falls
to
my
lot
i
will
fight
as
i
stand
my
own
good
sword
shall
serve
my
need
now
as
it
has
done
before
content
but
blame
not
me
who
offered
thee
equality
of
weapons
said
the
mountaineer
and
now
hear
me
this
is
a
fight
for
life
or
death
yon
waterfall
sounds
the
alarum
for
our
yes
old
bellower
he
continued
looking
back
it
is
long
since
thou
hast
heard
the
noise
of
battle
and
look
at
it
ere
we
begin
stranger
for
if
you
fall
i
will
commit
your
body
to
its
waters
and
if
thou
proud
swiss
answered
arthur
as
well
i
trust
thy
presumption
leads
to
destruction
i
will
have
thee
buried
in
the
church
at
einsiedlen
where
the
priests
shall
sing
masses
for
thy
soul
thy
sword
shall
be
displayed
above
thy
grave
and
a
scroll
shall
tell
the
passenger
here
lies
a
bear
cub
of
berne
slain
by
arthur
the
englishman
the
stone
is
not
in
switzerland
rocky
as
it
is
said
rudolph
scornfully
that
shall
bear
that
inscription
prepare
thyself
for
battle
the
englishman
cast
a
calm
and
deliberate
glance
around
the
scene
of
action
a
courtyard
partly
open
partly
encumbered
with
ruins
in
less
and
larger
masses
methinks
said
he
to
himself
a
master
of
his
weapon
with
the
instructions
of
bottaferma
of
florence
in
his
remembrance
a
light
heart
a
good
blade
a
firm
hand
and
a
just
cause
might
make
up
a
worse
odds
than
two
feet
of
steel
thinking
thus
and
imprinting
on
his
mind
as
much
as
the
time
would
permit
every
circumstance
of
the
locality
around
him
which
promised
advantage
in
the
combat
and
taking
his
station
in
the
middle
of
the
courtyard
where
the
ground
was
entirely
clear
he
flung
his
cloak
from
him
and
drew
his
sword
rudolph
had
at
first
believed
that
his
foreign
antagonist
was
an
effeminate
youth
who
would
be
swept
from
before
him
at
the
first
flourish
of
his
tremendous
weapon
but
the
firm
and
watchful
attitude
assumed
by
the
young
man
reminded
the
swiss
of
the
deficiencies
of
his
own
unwieldy
implement
and
made
him
determine
to
avoid
any
precipitation
which
might
give
advantage
to
an
enemy
who
seemed
both
daring
and
vigilant
he
unsheathed
his
huge
sword
by
drawing
it
over
the
left
shoulder
an
operation
which
required
some
little
time
and
might
have
offered
formidable
advantage
to
his
antagonist
had
arthur
sense
of
honour
permitted
him
to
begin
the
attack
ere
it
was
completed
the
englishman
remained
firm
however
until
the
swiss
displaying
his
bright
brand
to
the
morning
sun
made
three
or
four
flourishes
as
if
to
prove
its
weight
and
the
facility
with
which
he
wielded
it
then
stood
firm
within
of
his
adversary
grasping
his
weapon
with
both
hands
and
advancing
it
a
little
before
his
body
with
the
blade
pointed
straight
upwards
the
englishman
on
the
contrary
carried
his
sword
in
one
hand
holding
it
across
his
face
in
a
horizontal
position
so
as
to
be
at
once
ready
to
strike
thrust
or
parry
strike
englishman
said
the
switzer
after
they
had
confronted
each
other
in
this
manner
for
about
a
minute
the
longest
sword
should
strike
first
said
arthur
and
the
words
had
not
left
his
mouth
when
the
swiss
sword
rose
and
descended
with
a
rapidity
which
the
weight
and
size
of
the
weapon
considered
appeared
portentous
no
parry
however
dexterously
interposed
could
have
baffled
the
ruinous
descent
of
that
dreadful
weapon
by
which
the
champion
of
berne
had
hoped
at
once
to
begin
the
battle
and
end
it
but
young
philipson
had
not
the
justice
of
his
own
eye
or
the
activity
of
his
limbs
ere
the
blade
descended
a
sudden
spring
to
one
side
carried
him
from
beneath
its
heavy
sway
and
before
the
swiss
could
again
raise
his
sword
aloft
he
received
a
wound
though
a
slight
one
upon
the
left
arm
irritated
at
the
failure
and
at
the
wound
the
switzer
heaved
up
his
sword
once
more
and
availing
himself
of
a
strength
corresponding
to
his
size
he
discharged
towards
his
adversary
a
succession
of
blows
downright
athwart
horizontal
and
from
left
to
right
with
such
surprising
strength
and
velocity
that
it
required
all
the
address
of
the
young
englishman
by
parrying
shifting
eluding
or
retreating
to
evade
a
storm
of
which
every
individual
blow
seemed
sufficient
to
cleave
a
solid
rock
the
englishman
was
compelled
to
give
ground
now
backwards
now
swerving
to
the
one
side
or
the
other
now
availing
himself
of
the
fragments
of
the
ruins
but
watching
all
the
while
with
the
utmost
composure
the
moment
when
the
strength
of
his
enraged
enemy
might
become
somewhat
exhausted
or
when
by
some
improvident
or
furious
blow
he
might
again
lay
himself
open
to
a
close
attack
the
latter
of
these
advantages
had
nearly
occurred
for
in
the
middle
of
his
headlong
charge
the
switzer
stumbled
over
a
large
stone
concealed
among
the
long
grass
and
ere
he
could
recover
himself
received
a
severe
blow
across
the
head
from
his
antagonist
it
lighted
upon
his
bonnet
the
lining
of
which
enclosed
a
small
steel
cap
so
that
he
escaped
unwounded
and
springing
up
renewed
the
battle
with
unabated
fury
though
it
seemed
to
the
young
englishman
with
breath
somewhat
short
and
blows
dealt
with
more
caution
they
were
still
contending
with
equal
fortune
when
a
stern
voice
rising
over
the
clash
of
swords
as
well
as
the
roar
of
waters
called
out
in
a
commanding
tone
on
your
lives
forbear
the
two
combatants
sank
the
points
of
their
swords
not
very
sorry
perhaps
for
the
interruption
of
a
strife
which
must
otherwise
have
had
a
deadly
termination
they
looked
round
and
the
landamman
stood
before
them
with
anger
frowning
on
his
broad
and
expressive
forehead
how
now
boys
he
said
are
you
guests
of
arnold
biederman
and
do
you
dishonour
his
house
by
acts
of
violence
more
becoming
the
wolves
of
the
mountains
than
beings
to
whom
the
great
creator
has
given
a
form
after
his
own
likeness
and
an
immortal
soul
to
be
saved
by
penance
and
repentance
arthur
said
the
elder
philipson
who
had
come
up
at
the
same
time
with
their
host
what
frenzy
is
this
are
your
duties
of
so
light
and
heedless
a
nature
as
to
give
time
and
place
for
quarrels
and
combats
with
every
idle
boor
who
chances
to
be
boastful
at
once
and
the
young
men
whose
strife
had
ceased
at
the
entrance
of
these
unexpected
spectators
stood
looking
at
each
other
and
resting
on
their
swords
rudolph
donnerhugel
said
the
landamman
give
thy
sword
to
me
to
me
the
owner
of
this
ground
the
master
of
this
family
and
magistrate
of
the
canton
and
which
is
more
answered
rudolph
submissively
to
you
who
are
arnold
biederman
at
whose
command
every
native
of
these
mountains
draws
his
sword
or
sheathes
it
he
gave
his
sword
to
the
landamman
now
by
my
honest
word
said
biederman
it
is
the
same
with
which
thy
father
stephen
fought
so
gloriously
at
sempach
abreast
with
the
famous
de
winkelried
shame
it
is
that
it
should
be
drawn
on
a
helpless
and
you
young
sir
continued
the
swiss
addressing
arthur
while
his
father
said
at
the
same
time
young
man
yield
up
your
sword
to
the
landamman
it
shall
not
need
sir
replied
the
young
englishman
since
for
my
part
i
hold
our
strife
at
an
end
this
gallant
gentleman
called
me
hither
on
a
trial
as
i
conceive
of
courage
i
can
give
my
unqualified
testimony
to
his
gallantry
and
swordmanship
and
as
i
trust
he
will
say
nothing
to
the
shame
of
my
manhood
i
think
our
strife
has
lasted
long
enough
for
the
purpose
which
gave
rise
to
it
too
long
for
me
said
rudolph
frankly
the
green
sleeve
of
my
doublet
which
i
wore
of
that
colour
out
of
my
love
to
the
forest
cantons
is
now
stained
into
as
dirty
a
crimson
as
could
have
been
done
by
any
dyer
in
ypres
or
ghent
but
i
heartily
forgive
the
brave
stranger
who
has
spoiled
my
jerkin
and
given
its
master
a
lesson
he
will
not
soon
forget
had
all
englishmen
been
like
your
guest
worthy
kinsman
methinks
the
mound
at
buttisholz
had
hardly
risen
so
high
cousin
rudolph
said
the
landamman
smoothing
his
brow
as
his
kinsman
spoke
i
have
ever
thought
thee
as
generous
as
thou
art
harebrained
and
quarrelsome
and
you
my
young
guest
may
rely
that
when
a
swiss
says
the
quarrel
is
over
there
is
no
chance
of
its
being
renewed
we
are
not
like
the
men
of
the
valleys
to
the
eastward
who
nurse
revenge
as
if
it
were
a
favourite
child
and
now
join
hands
my
children
and
let
us
forget
this
foolish
feud
here
is
my
hand
brave
stranger
said
donnerhugel
thou
hast
taught
me
a
trick
of
fence
and
when
we
have
broken
our
fast
we
will
by
your
leave
to
the
forest
where
i
will
teach
you
a
trick
of
woodcraft
in
return
when
your
foot
hath
half
the
experience
of
your
hand
and
your
eye
hath
gained
a
portion
of
the
steadiness
of
your
heart
you
will
not
find
many
hunters
to
match
you
arthur
with
all
the
ready
confidence
of
youth
readily
embraced
a
proposition
so
frankly
made
and
before
they
reached
the
house
various
subjects
of
sport
were
eagerly
discussed
between
them
with
as
much
cordiality
as
if
no
disturbance
of
their
concord
had
taken
place
now
this
said
the
landamman
is
as
it
should
be
i
am
ever
ready
to
forgive
the
headlong
impetuosity
of
our
youth
if
they
will
be
but
manly
and
open
in
their
reconciliation
and
bear
their
heart
on
their
tongue
as
a
true
swiss
should
these
two
youths
had
made
but
wild
work
of
it
however
said
philipson
had
not
your
care
my
worthy
host
learned
of
their
rendezvous
and
called
me
to
assist
in
breaking
their
purpose
may
i
ask
how
it
came
to
your
knowledge
so
opportunely
it
was
through
means
of
my
domestic
fairy
answered
arnold
biederman
who
seems
born
for
the
good
luck
of
my
family
i
mean
my
niece
anne
who
had
observed
a
glove
exchanged
betwixt
the
two
young
braggadocios
and
heard
them
mention
geierstein
and
break
of
day
oh
sir
it
is
much
to
see
a
woman
sharpness
of
wit
it
would
have
been
long
enough
ere
any
of
my
sons
had
shown
themselves
so
apprehensive
i
think
i
see
our
propitious
protectress
peeping
at
us
from
yonder
high
ground
said
philipson
but
it
seems
as
if
she
would
willingly
observe
us
without
being
seen
in
return
ay
said
the
landamman
she
has
been
looking
out
to
see
that
there
has
been
no
hurt
done
and
now
i
warrant
me
the
foolish
girl
is
ashamed
of
having
shown
such
a
laudable
degree
of
interest
in
a
matter
of
the
kind
methinks
said
the
englishman
i
would
willingly
return
my
thanks
in
your
presence
to
the
fair
maiden
to
whom
i
have
been
so
highly
indebted
there
can
be
no
better
time
than
the
present
said
the
landamman
and
he
sent
through
the
groves
the
maiden
name
in
one
of
those
shrilly
accented
tones
which
we
have
already
noticed
anne
of
geierstein
as
philipson
had
before
observed
was
stationed
upon
a
knoll
at
some
distance
and
concealed
as
she
thought
from
notice
by
a
screen
of
brushwood
she
started
at
her
uncle
summons
therefore
but
presently
obeyed
it
and
avoiding
the
young
men
who
passed
on
foremost
she
joined
the
landamman
and
philipson
by
a
circuitous
path
through
the
woods
my
worthy
friend
and
guest
would
speak
with
you
anne
said
the
landamman
so
soon
as
the
morning
greeting
had
been
exchanged
the
swiss
maiden
coloured
over
brow
as
well
as
cheek
when
philipson
with
a
grace
which
seemed
beyond
his
calling
addressed
her
in
these
words
it
happens
sometimes
to
us
merchants
my
fair
young
friend
that
we
are
unlucky
enough
not
to
possess
means
for
the
instant
defraying
of
our
debts
but
he
is
justly
held
amongst
us
as
the
meanest
of
mankind
who
does
not
acknowledge
them
accept
therefore
the
thanks
of
a
father
whose
son
your
courage
only
yesterday
saved
from
destruction
and
whom
your
prudence
has
this
very
morning
rescued
from
a
great
danger
and
grieve
me
not
by
refusing
to
wear
these
earrings
he
added
producing
a
small
which
he
opened
as
he
spoke
they
are
it
is
true
only
of
pearls
but
they
have
not
been
thought
unworthy
the
ears
of
a
countess
and
must
therefore
said
the
old
landamman
show
misplaced
on
the
person
of
a
swiss
maiden
of
unterwalden
for
such
and
no
more
is
my
niece
anne
while
she
resides
in
my
solitude
methinks
good
master
philipson
you
display
less
than
your
usual
judgment
in
matching
the
quality
of
your
gifts
with
the
rank
of
her
on
whom
they
are
bestowed
as
a
merchant
too
you
should
remember
that
large
guerdons
will
lighten
your
gains
let
me
crave
your
pardon
my
good
host
answered
the
englishman
while
i
reply
that
at
least
i
have
consulted
my
own
sense
of
the
obligation
under
which
i
labour
and
have
chosen
out
of
what
i
have
at
my
free
disposal
that
which
i
thought
might
best
express
it
i
trust
the
host
whom
i
have
found
hitherto
so
kind
will
not
prevent
this
young
maiden
from
accepting
what
is
at
least
not
unbecoming
the
rank
she
is
born
to
and
you
will
judge
me
unjustly
if
you
think
me
capable
of
doing
either
myself
or
you
the
wrong
of
offering
any
token
of
a
value
beyond
what
i
can
well
spare
the
landamman
took
the
into
his
own
hand
i
have
ever
set
my
countenance
he
said
against
gaudy
gems
which
are
leading
us
daily
further
astray
from
the
simplicity
of
our
fathers
and
and
yet
he
added
with
a
smile
and
holding
one
of
the
earrings
close
to
his
relation
face
the
ornaments
do
set
off
the
wench
rarely
and
they
say
girls
have
more
pleasure
in
wearing
such
toys
than
men
can
comprehend
wherefore
dear
anne
as
thou
hast
deserved
a
dearer
trust
in
a
greater
matter
i
refer
thee
entirely
to
thine
own
wisdom
to
accept
of
our
good
friend
costly
present
and
wear
it
or
not
as
thou
thinkest
fit
since
such
is
your
pleasure
my
best
friend
and
kinsman
said
the
young
maiden
blushing
as
she
spoke
i
will
not
give
pain
to
our
valued
guest
by
refusing
what
he
desires
so
earnestly
that
i
should
accept
but
by
his
leave
good
uncle
and
yours
i
will
bestow
these
splendid
earrings
on
the
shrine
of
our
lady
of
einsiedlen
to
express
our
general
gratitude
to
her
protecting
favour
which
has
been
around
us
in
the
terrors
of
yesterday
storm
and
the
alarms
of
this
morning
discord
by
our
lady
the
wench
speaks
sensibly
said
the
landamman
and
her
wisdom
has
applied
the
bounty
well
my
good
guest
to
bespeak
prayers
for
thy
family
and
mine
and
for
the
general
peace
of
go
to
anne
thou
shalt
have
a
necklace
of
jet
at
next
if
our
fleeces
bear
any
price

the
market
chapter
vii
let
him
who
will
not
proffer
peace
receive
be
sated
with
the
plagues
which
war
can
give
and
well
thy
hatred
of
the
peace
is
known
if
now
thy
soul
reject
the
friendship
shown
hoole
the
confidence
betwixt
the
landamman
and
the
english
merchant
appeared
to
increase
during
the
course
of
a
few
busy
days
which
occurred
before
that
appointed
for
the
commencement
of
their
journey
to
the
court
of
charles
of
burgundy
the
state
of
europe
and
of
the
helvetian
confederacy
has
been
already
alluded
to
but
for
the
distinct
explanation
of
our
story
may
be
here
briefly
recapitulated
in
the
interval
of
a
week
whilst
the
english
travellers
remained
at
geierstein
meetings
or
diets
were
held
as
well
of
the
city
cantons
of
the
confederacy
as
of
those
of
the
forest
the
former
aggrieved
by
the
taxes
imposed
on
their
commerce
by
the
duke
of
burgundy
rendered
yet
more
intolerable
by
the
violence
of
the
agents
whom
he
employed
in
such
oppression
were
eager
for
war
in
which
they
had
hitherto
uniformly
found
victory
and
wealth
many
of
them
were
also
privately
instigated
to
arms
by
the
largesses
of
louis
who
spared
neither
intrigues
nor
gold
to
effect
a
breach
betwixt
these
dauntless
confederates
and
his
formidable
enemy
charles
the
bold
on
the
other
hand
there
were
many
reasons
which
appeared
to
render
it
impolitic
for
the
switzers
to
engage
in
war
with
one
of
the
most
wealthy
most
obstinate
and
most
powerful
princes
in
europe
for
such
unquestionably
was
charles
of
burgundy
without
the
existence
of
some
strong
reason
affecting
their
own
honour
and
independence
every
day
brought
fresh
intelligence
from
the
interior
that
edward
the
fourth
of
england
had
entered
into
a
strict
and
intimate
alliance
offensive
and
defensive
with
the
duke
of
burgundy
and
that
it
was
the
purpose
of
the
english
king
renowned
for
his
numerous
victories
over
the
rival
house
of
lancaster
by
which
after
various
reverses
he
had
obtained
undisputed
possession
of
the
throne
to
reassert
his
claims
to
those
provinces
of
france
so
long
held
by
his
ancestors
it
seemed
as
if
this
alone
were
wanting
to
his
fame
and
that
having
subdued
his
internal
enemies
he
now
turned
his
eyes
to
the
regaining
of
those
rich
and
valuable
foreign
possessions
which
had
been
lost
during
the
administration
of
the
feeble
henry
vi
and
the
civil
discords
so
dreadfully
prosecuted
in
the
wars
of
the
white
and
red
roses
it
was
universally
known
that
throughout
england
generally
the
loss
of
the
french
provinces
was
felt
as
a
national
degradation
and
that
not
only
the
nobility
who
had
in
consequence
been
deprived
of
the
large
fiefs
which
they
had
held
in
normandy
gascony
maine
and
anjou
but
the
warlike
gentry
accustomed
to
gain
both
fame
and
wealth
at
the
expense
of
france
and
the
fiery
yeomanry
whose
bows
had
decided
so
many
fatal
battles
were
as
eager
to
renew
the
conflict
as
their
ancestors
of
cressy
poitiers
and
agincourt
had
been
to
follow
their
sovereign
to
the
fields
of
victory
on
which
their
deeds
had
conferred
deathless
renown
the
latest
and
most
authentic
intelligence
bore
that
the
king
of
england
was
on
the
point
of
passing
to
france
in
person
an
invasion
rendered
easy
by
his
possession
of
calais
with
an
army
superior
in
numbers
and
discipline
to
any
with
which
an
english
monarch
had
ever
before
entered
that
kingdom
that
all
the
hostile
preparations
were
completed
and
that
the
arrival
of
edward
might
instantly
be
expected
whilst
the
powerful
of
the
duke
of
burgundy
and
the
assistance
of
numerous
disaffected
french
noblemen
in
the
provinces
which
had
been
so
long
under
the
english
dominion
threatened
a
fearful
issue
of
the
war
to
louis
sagacious
wise
and
powerful
as
that
prince
unquestionably
was
it
would
no
doubt
have
been
the
wisest
policy
of
charles
of
burgundy
when
thus
engaging
in
an
alliance
against
his
most
formidable
neighbour
and
hereditary
as
well
as
personal
enemy
to
have
avoided
all
cause
of
quarrel
with
the
helvetian
confederacy
a
poor
but
most
warlike
people
who
already
had
been
taught
by
repeated
successes
to
feel
that
their
hardy
infantry
could
if
necessary
engage
on
terms
of
equality
or
even
of
advantage
the
flower
of
that
chivalry
which
had
hitherto
been
considered
as
forming
the
strength
of
european
battle
but
the
measures
of
charles
whom
fortune
had
opposed
to
the
most
astucious
and
politic
monarch
of
his
time
were
always
dictated
by
passionate
feeling
and
impulse
rather
than
by
a
judicious
consideration
of
the
circumstances
in
which
he
stood
haughty
proud
and
uncompromising
though
neither
destitute
of
honour
nor
generosity
he
despised
and
hated
what
he
termed
the
paltry
associations
of
herdsmen
and
shepherds
united
with
a
few
towns
which
subsisted
chiefly
by
commerce
and
instead
of
courting
the
helvetian
cantons
like
his
crafty
enemy
or
at
least
affording
them
no
ostensible
pretence
of
quarrel
he
omitted
no
opportunity
of
showing
the
disregard
and
contempt
in
which
he
held
their
upstart
consequence
and
of
evincing
the
secret
longing
which
he
entertained
to
take
vengeance
upon
them
for
the
quantity
of
noble
blood
which
they
had
shed
and
to
compensate
the
repeated
successes
they
had
gained
over
the
feudal
lords
of
whom
he
imagined
himself
the
destined
avenger
the
duke
of
burgundy
possessions
in
the
alsatian
territory
afforded
him
many
opportunities
for
wreaking
his
displeasure
upon
the
swiss
league
the
little
castle
and
town
of
ferette
lying
within
ten
or
eleven
miles
of
bâle
served
as
a
thoroughfare
to
the
traffic
of
berne
and
soleure
the
two
principal
towns
of
the
confederation
in
this
place
the
duke
posted
a
governor
or
seneschal
who
was
also
an
administrator
of
the
revenue
and
seemed
born
on
purpose
to
be
the
plague
and
scourge
of
his
republican
neighbours
archibald
von
hagenbach
was
a
german
noble
whose
possessions
lay
in
suabia
and
was
universally
esteemed
one
of
the
fiercest
and
most
lawless
of
that
frontier
nobility
known
by
the
name
of
and
these
dignitaries
because
they
held
their
fiefs
of
the
holy
roman
empire
claimed
as
complete
sovereignty
within
their
territories
of
a
mile
square
as
any
reigning
prince
of
germany
in
his
more
extended
dominions
they
levied
tolls
and
taxes
on
strangers
and
imprisoned
tried
and
executed
those
who
as
they
alleged
had
committed
offences
within
their
petty
domains
but
especially
and
in
further
exercise
of
their
seignorial
privileges
they
made
war
on
each
other
and
on
the
free
cities
of
the
empire
attacking
and
plundering
without
mercy
the
caravans
or
large
trains
of
wagons
by
which
the
internal
commerce
of
germany
was
carried
on
a
succession
of
injuries
done
and
received
by
archibald
of
hagenbach
who
had
been
one
of
the
fiercest
sticklers
for
this
privilege
of
or
as
it
may
be
termed
had
ended
in
his
being
obliged
though
somewhat
advanced
in
life
to
leave
a
country
where
his
tenure
of
existence
was
become
extremely
precarious
and
to
engage
in
the
service
of
the
duke
of
burgundy
who
willingly
employed
him
as
he
was
a
man
of
high
descent
and
proved
valour
and
not
the
less
perhaps
that
he
was
sure
to
find
in
a
man
of
hagenbach
fierce
rapacious
and
haughty
disposition
the
unscrupulous
executioner
of
whatsoever
severities
it
might
be
his
master
pleasure
to
enjoin
the
traders
of
berne
and
soleure
accordingly
made
loud
and
violent
complaints
of
hagenbach
exactions
the
impositions
laid
on
commodities
which
passed
through
his
district
of
la
ferette
to
whatever
place
they
might
be
ultimately
bound
were
arbitrarily
increased
and
the
merchants
and
traders
who
hesitated
to
make
instant
payment
of
what
was
demanded
were
exposed
to
imprisonment
and
personal
punishment
the
commercial
towns
of
germany
appealed
to
the
duke
against
this
iniquitous
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
governor
of
la
ferette
and
requested
of
his
grace
goodness
that
he
would
withdraw
von
hagenbach
from
their
neighbourhood
but
the
duke
treated
their
complaints
with
contempt
the
swiss
league
carried
their
remonstrances
higher
and
required
that
justice
should
be
done
on
the
governor
of
la
ferette
as
having
offended
against
the
law
of
nations
but
they
were
equally
unable
to
attract
attention
or
obtain
redress
at
length
the
diet
of
the
confederation
determined
to
send
the
solemn
deputation
which
has
been
repeatedly
mentioned
one
or
two
of
these
envoys
joined
with
the
calm
and
prudent
arnold
biederman
in
the
hope
that
so
solemn
a
measure
might
open
the
eyes
of
the
duke
to
the
wicked
injustice
of
his
representative
others
among
the
deputies
having
no
such
peaceful
views
were
determined
by
this
resolute
remonstrance
to
pave
the
way
for
hostilities
arnold
biederman
was
an
especial
advocate
for
peace
while
its
preservation
was
compatible
with
national
independence
and
the
honour
of
the
confederacy
but
the
younger
philipson
soon
discovered
that
the
landamman
alone
of
all
his
family
cherished
these
moderate
views
the
opinion
of
his
sons
had
been
swayed
and
seduced
by
the
impetuous
eloquence
and
overbearing
influence
of
rudolph
of
donnerhugel
who
by
some
feats
of
peculiar
gallantry
and
the
consideration
due
to
the
merit
of
his
ancestors
had
acquired
an
influence
in
the
councils
of
his
native
canton
and
with
the
youth
of
the
league
in
general
beyond
what
was
usually
yielded
by
these
wise
republicans
to
men
of
his
early
age
arthur
who
was
now
an
acceptable
and
welcome
companion
of
all
their
hunting
parties
and
other
sports
heard
nothing
among
the
young
men
but
anticipations
of
war
rendered
delightful
by
the
hopes
of
booty
and
of
distinction
which
were
to
be
obtained
by
the
switzers
the
feats
of
their
ancestors
against
the
germans
had
been
so
wonderful
as
to
realise
the
fabulous
victories
of
romance
and
while
the
present
race
possessed
the
same
hardy
limbs
and
the
same
inflexible
courage
they
eagerly
anticipated
the
same
distinguished
success
when
the
governor
of
la
ferette
was
mentioned
in
the
conversation
he
was
usually
spoken
of
as
the
bandog
of
burgundy
or
the
alsatian
mastiff
and
intimations
were
openly
given
that
if
his
course
were
not
instantly
checked
by
his
master
and
he
himself
withdrawn
from
the
frontiers
of
switzerland
archibald
of
hagenbach
would
find
his
fortress
no
protection
from
the
awakened
indignation
of
the
wronged
inhabitants
of
soleure
and
particularly
of
those
of
berne
this
general
disposition
to
war
among
the
young
switzers
was
reported
to
the
elder
philipson
by
his
son
and
led
him
at
one
time
to
hesitate
whether
he
ought
not
rather
to
resume
all
the
inconveniences
and
dangers
of
a
journey
accompanied
only
by
arthur
than
run
the
risk
of
the
quarrels
in
which
he
might
be
involved
by
the
unruly
conduct
of
these
fierce
mountain
youths
after
they
should
have
left
their
own
frontiers
such
an
event
would
have
had
in
a
peculiar
degree
the
effect
of
destroying
every
purpose
of
his
journey
but
respected
as
arnold
biederman
was
by
his
family
and
countrymen
the
english
merchant
concluded
upon
the
whole
that
his
influence
would
be
able
to
restrain
his
companions
until
the
great
question
of
peace
or
war
should
be
determined
and
especially
until
they
should
have
discharged
their
commission
by
obtaining
an
audience
of
the
duke
of
burgundy
and
after
this
he
should
be
separated
from
their
society
and
not
liable
to
be
engaged
in
any
responsibility
for
their
ulterior
measures
after
a
delay
of
about
ten
days
the
deputation
commissioned
to
remonstrate
with
the
duke
on
the
aggressions
and
exactions
of
archibald
of
hagenbach
at
length
assembled
at
geierstein
whence
the
members
were
to
journey
forth
together
they
were
three
in
number
besides
the
young
bernese
and
the
landamman
of
unterwalden
one
was
like
arnold
a
proprietor
from
the
forest
cantons
wearing
a
dress
scarcely
handsomer
than
that
of
a
common
herdsman
but
distinguished
by
the
beauty
and
size
of
his
long
silvery
beard
his
name
was
nicholas
bonstetten
melchior
sturmthal
of
berne
a
man
of
middle
age
and
a
soldier
of
distinguished
courage
with
adam
zimmerman
a
burgess
of
soleure
who
was
considerably
older
completed
the
number
of
the
envoys
each
was
dressed
after
his
best
fashion
but
notwithstanding
that
the
severe
eye
of
arnold
biederman
censured
one
or
two
silver
as
well
as
a
chain
of
the
same
metal
which
decorated
the
portly
person
of
the
burgess
of
soleure
it
seemed
that
a
powerful
and
victorious
people
for
such
the
swiss
were
now
to
be
esteemed
were
never
represented
by
an
embassy
of
such
patriarchal
simplicity
the
deputies
travelled
on
foot
with
their
piked
staves
in
their
hands
like
pilgrims
bound
for
some
place
of
devotion
two
mules
which
bore
their
little
stock
of
baggage
were
led
by
young
lads
sons
or
cousins
of
members
of
the
embassy
who
had
obtained
permission
in
this
manner
to
get
such
a
glance
of
the
world
beyond
the
mountains
as
this
journey
promised
to
afford
but
although
their
retinue
was
small
so
far
as
respected
either
state
or
personal
attendance
and
accommodation
the
dangerous
circumstances
of
the
times
and
the
very
unsettled
state
of
the
country
beyond
their
own
territories
did
not
permit
men
charged
with
affairs
of
such
importance
to
travel
without
a
guard
even
the
danger
arising
from
the
wolves
which
when
pinched
by
the
approach
of
winter
have
been
known
to
descend
from
their
mountain
fastnesses
into
open
villages
such
as
those
the
travellers
might
choose
to
quarter
in
rendered
the
presence
of
some
escort
necessary
and
the
bands
of
deserters
from
various
services
who
formed
parties
of
banditti
on
the
frontiers
of
alsatia
and
germany
combined
to
recommend
such
a
precaution
accordingly
about
twenty
of
the
selected
youth
from
the
various
swiss
cantons
including
rudiger
ernest
and
sigismund
arnold
three
eldest
sons
attended
upon
the
deputation
they
did
not
however
observe
any
military
order
or
march
close
or
near
to
the
patriarchal
train
on
the
contrary
they
formed
hunting
parties
of
five
or
six
together
who
explored
the
rocks
woods
and
passes
of
the
mountains
through
which
the
envoys
journeyed
their
slower
pace
allowed
the
active
young
men
who
were
accompanied
by
their
large
shaggy
dogs
full
time
to
destroy
wolves
and
bears
or
occasionally
to
surprise
a
chamois
among
the
cliffs
while
the
hunters
even
while
in
pursuit
of
their
sport
were
careful
to
examine
such
places
as
might
afford
opportunity
for
ambush
and
thus
ascertained
the
safety
of
the
party
whom
they
escorted
more
securely
than
if
they
had
attended
close
on
their
train
a
peculiar
note
on
the
huge
swiss
bugle
before
described
formed
of
the
horn
of
the
mountain
bull
was
the
signal
agreed
upon
for
collecting
in
a
body
should
danger
occur
rudolph
donnerhugel
so
much
younger
than
his
brethren
in
the
same
important
commission
took
the
command
of
this
mountain
whom
he
usually
accompanied
in
their
sportive
excursions
in
point
of
arms
they
were
well
provided
bearing
swords
long
partisans
and
spears
as
well
as
both
cross
and
long
bows
short
cutlasses
and
huntsmen
knives
the
heavier
weapons
as
impeding
their
activity
were
carried
with
the
baggage
but
were
ready
to
be
assumed
on
the
slightest
alarm
arthur
philipson
like
his
late
antagonist
naturally
preferred
the
company
and
sports
of
the
younger
men
to
the
grave
conversation
and
slow
pace
of
the
fathers
of
the
mountain
commonwealth
there
was
however
one
temptation
to
loiter
with
the
baggage
which
had
other
circumstances
permitted
might
have
reconciled
the
young
englishman
to
forego
the
opportunities
of
sport
which
the
swiss
youth
so
eagerly
sought
after
and
endure
the
slow
pace
and
grave
conversation
of
the
elders
of
the
party
in
a
word
anne
of
geierstein
accompanied
by
a
swiss
girl
her
attendant
travelled
in
the
rear
of
the
deputation
the
two
females
were
mounted
upon
asses
whose
slow
step
hardly
kept
pace
with
the
baggage
mules
and
it
may
be
fairly
suspected
that
arthur
philipson
in
requital
of
the
important
services
which
he
had
received
from
that
beautiful
and
interesting
young
woman
would
have
deemed
it
no
extreme
hardship
to
have
afforded
her
occasionally
his
assistance
on
the
journey
and
the
advantage
of
his
conversation
to
relieve
the
tediousness
of
the
way
but
he
dared
not
presume
to
offer
attentions
which
the
customs
of
the
country
did
not
seem
to
permit
since
they
were
not
attempted
by
any
of
the
maiden
cousins
or
even
by
rudolph
donnerhugel
who
certainly
had
hitherto
appeared
to
neglect
no
opportunity
to
recommend
himself
to
his
fair
cousin
besides
arthur
had
reflection
enough
to
be
convinced
that
in
yielding
to
the
feelings
which
impelled
him
to
cultivate
the
acquaintance
of
this
amiable
young
person
he
would
certainly
incur
the
serious
displeasure
of
his
father
and
probably
also
that
of
her
uncle
by
whose
hospitality
they
had
profited
and
whose
they
were
in
the
act
of
enjoying
the
young
englishman
therefore
pursued
the
same
amusements
which
interested
the
other
young
men
of
the
party
managing
only
as
frequently
as
their
halts
permitted
to
venture
upon
offering
to
the
maiden
such
marks
of
courtesy
as
could
afford
no
room
for
remark
or
censure
and
his
character
as
a
sportsman
being
now
well
established
he
sometimes
permitted
himself
even
when
the
game
was
afoot
to
loiter
in
the
vicinity
of
the
path
on
which
he
could
at
least
mark
the
flutter
of
the
grey
wimple
of
anne
of
geierstein
and
the
outline
of
the
form
which
it
shrouded
this
indolence
as
it
seemed
was
not
unfavourably
construed
by
his
companions
being
only
accounted
an
indifference
to
the
less
noble
or
less
dangerous
game
for
when
the
object
was
a
bear
wolf
or
other
animal
of
prey
no
spear
cutlass
or
bow
of
the
party
not
even
those
of
rudolph
donnerhugel
were
so
prompt
in
the
chase
as
those
of
the
young
englishman
meantime
the
elder
philipson
had
other
and
more
serious
subjects
of
consideration
he
was
a
man
as
the
reader
must
have
already
seen
of
much
acquaintance
with
the
world
in
which
he
had
acted
parts
different
from
that
which
he
now
sustained
former
feelings
were
recalled
and
awakened
by
the
view
of
sports
familiar
to
his
early
years
the
clamour
of
the
hounds
echoing
from
the
wild
hills
and
dark
forests
through
which
they
travelled
the
sight
of
the
gallant
young
huntsmen
appearing
as
they
brought
the
object
of
their
chase
to
bay
amid
airy
cliffs
and
profound
precipices
which
seemed
impervious
to
the
human
foot
the
sounds
of
halloo
and
horn
reverberating
from
hill
to
hill
had
more
than
once
impelled
him
to
take
a
share
in
the
hazardous
but
animating
amusement
which
next
to
war
was
then
in
most
parts
of
europe
the
most
serious
occupation
of
life
but
the
feeling
was
transient
and
he
became
yet
more
deeply
interested
in
studying
the
manners
and
opinions
of
the
persons
with
whom
he
was
travelling
they
seemed
to
be
all
coloured
with
the
same
downright
and
blunt
simplicity
which
characterised
arnold
biederman
although
it
was
in
none
of
them
elevated
by
the
same
dignity
of
thought
or
profound
sagacity
in
speaking
of
the
political
state
of
their
country
they
affected
no
secrecy
and
although
with
the
exception
of
rudolph
their
own
young
men
were
not
admitted
into
their
councils
the
exclusion
seemed
only
adopted
with
a
view
to
the
necessary
subordination
of
youth
to
age
and
not
for
the
purpose
of
observing
any
mystery
in
the
presence
of
the
elder
philipson
they
freely
discussed
the
pretensions
of
the
duke
of
burgundy
the
means
which
their
country
possessed
of
maintaining
her
independence
and
the
firm
resolution
of
the
helvetian
league
to
bid
defiance
to
the
utmost
force
the
world
could
bring
against
it
rather
than
submit
to
the
slightest
insult
in
other
respects
their
views
appeared
wise
and
moderate
although
both
the
banneret
of
berne
and
the
consequential
burgher
of
soleure
seemed
to
hold
the
consequences
of
war
more
lightly
than
they
were
viewed
by
the
cautious
landamman
of
unterwalden
and
his
venerable
companion
nicholas
bonstetten
who
subscribed
to
all
his
opinions
it
frequently
happened
that
quitting
these
subjects
the
conversation
turned
on
such
as
were
less
attractive
to
their
the
signs
of
the
weather
the
comparative
fertility
of
recent
seasons
the
most
advantageous
mode
of
managing
their
orchards
and
rearing
their
crops
though
interesting
to
the
mountaineers
themselves
gave
philipson
slender
amusement
and
notwithstanding
that
the
excellent
meinherr
zimmerman
of
soleure
would
fain
have
joined
with
him
in
conversation
respecting
trade
and
merchandise
yet
the
englishman
who
dealt
in
articles
of
small
bulk
and
considerable
value
and
traversed
sea
and
land
to
carry
on
his
traffic
could
find
few
mutual
topics
to
discuss
with
the
swiss
trader
whose
commerce
only
extended
into
the
neighbouring
districts
of
burgundy
and
germany
and
whose
goods
consisted
of
coarse
woollen
cloths
fustian
hides
peltry
and
such
ordinary
articles
but
ever
and
anon
while
the
switzers
were
discussing
some
paltry
interests
of
trade
or
describing
some
process
of
rude
cultivation
or
speaking
of
blights
in
grain
and
the
murrain
amongst
cattle
with
all
the
dull
minuteness
of
petty
farmers
and
traders
met
at
a
country
fair
a
spot
would
recall
the
name
and
story
of
a
battle
in
which
some
of
them
had
served
for
there
were
none
of
the
party
who
had
not
been
repeatedly
in
arms
and
the
military
details
which
in
other
countries
were
only
the
theme
of
knights
and
squires
who
had
acted
their
part
in
them
or
of
learned
clerks
who
laboured
to
record
them
were
in
this
singular
region
the
familiar
and
intimate
subjects
of
discussion
with
men
whose
peaceful
occupations
seemed
to
place
them
at
an
immeasurable
distance
from
the
profession
of
a
soldier
this
led
the
englishman
to
think
of
the
ancient
inhabitants
of
rome
where
the
plough
was
so
readily
exchanged
for
the
sword
and
the
cultivation
of
a
rude
farm
for
the
management
of
public
affairs
he
hinted
this
resemblance
to
the
landamman
who
was
naturally
gratified
with
the
compliment
to
his
country
but
presently
replied
may
heaven
continue
among
us
the
homebred
virtues
of
the
romans
and
preserve
us
from
their
lust
of
conquest
and
love
of
foreign
luxuries
the
slow
pace
of
the
travellers
with
various
causes
of
delay
which
it
is
unnecessary
to
dwell
upon
occasioned
the
deputation
spending
two
nights
on
the
road
before
they
reached
bâle
the
small
towns
or
villages
in
which
they
quartered
received
them
with
such
marks
of
respectful
hospitality
as
they
had
the
means
to
bestow
and
their
arrival
was
a
signal
for
a
little
feast
with
which
the
heads
of
the
community
uniformly
regaled
them
on
such
occasions
while
the
elders
of
the
village
entertained
the
deputies
of
the
confederation
the
young
men
of
the
escort
were
provided
for
by
those
of
their
own
age
several
of
whom
usually
aware
of
their
approach
were
accustomed
to
join
in
the
chase
of
the
day
and
made
the
strangers
acquainted
with
the
spots
where
game
was
most
plenty
these
feasts
were
never
prolonged
to
excess
and
the
most
special
dainties
which
composed
them
were
kids
lambs
and
game
the
produce
of
the
mountains
yet
it
seemed
both
to
arthur
philipson
and
his
father
that
the
advantages
of
good
cheer
were
more
prized
by
the
banneret
of
berne
and
the
burgess
of
soleure
than
by
their
host
the
landamman
and
the
deputy
of
schwitz
there
was
no
excess
committed
as
we
have
already
said
but
the
deputies
first
mentioned
obviously
understood
the
art
of
selecting
the
choicest
morsels
and
were
connoisseurs
in
the
good
wine
chiefly
of
foreign
growth
with
which
they
freely
washed
it
down
arnold
was
too
wise
to
censure
what
he
had
no
means
of
amending
he
contented
himself
by
observing
in
his
own
person
a
rigorous
diet
living
indeed
almost
entirely
upon
vegetables
and
fair
water
in
which
he
was
closely
imitated
by
the
old
nicholas
bonstetten
who
seemed
to
make
it
his
principal
object
to
follow
the
landamman
example
in
everything
it
was
as
we
have
already
said
the
third
day
after
the
commencement
of
their
journey
before
the
swiss
deputation
reached
the
vicinity
of
bâle
in
which
city
then
one
of
the
largest
in
the
extremity
of
germany
they
proposed
taking
up
their
abode
for
the
evening
nothing
doubting
a
friendly
reception
the
town
it
is
true
was
not
then
nor
till
about
thirty
years
afterwards
a
part
of
the
swiss
confederation
to
which
it
was
only
joined
in
but
it
was
a
free
imperial
city
connected
with
berne
soleure
lucerne
and
other
towns
of
switzerland
by
mutual
interests
and
constant
intercourse
it
was
the
object
of
the
deputation
to
negotiate
if
possible
a
peace
which
could
not
be
more
useful
to
themselves
than
to
the
city
of
bâle
considering
the
interruptions
of
commerce
which
must
be
occasioned
by
a
rupture
between
the
duke
of
burgundy
and
the
cantons
and
the
great
advantage
which
that
city
would
derive
by
preserving
a
neutrality
situated
as
it
was
betwixt
these
two
hostile
powers
they
anticipated
therefore
as
welcome
a
reception
from
the
authorities
of
bâle
as
they
had
received
while
in
the
bounds
of
their
own
confederation
since
the
interests
of
that
city
were
so
deeply
concerned
in
the
objects
of
their
mission
the
next
chapter
will
show
how
far
these
expectations
were
realised
chapter
viii
they
saw
that
city
welcoming
the
rhine
as
from
his
mountain
heritage
he
bursts
as
purposed
proud
orgetorix
of
yore
leaving
the
desert
region
of
the
hills
to
lord
it
the
fertile
plains
of
gaul
the
eyes
of
the
english
travellers
wearied
with
a
succession
of
wild
mountainous
scenery
now
gazed
with
pleasure
upon
a
country
still
indeed
irregular
and
hilly
in
its
surface
but
capable
of
high
cultivation
and
adorned
with
cornfields
and
vineyards
the
rhine
a
broad
and
large
river
poured
its
grey
stream
in
a
huge
sweep
through
the
landscape
and
divided
into
two
portions
the
city
of
bâle
which
is
situated
on
its
banks
the
southern
part
to
which
the
path
of
the
swiss
deputies
conducted
them
displayed
the
celebrated
cathedral
and
the
lofty
terrace
which
runs
in
front
of
it
and
seemed
to
remind
the
travellers
that
they
now
approached
a
country
in
which
the
operations
of
man
could
make
themselves
distinguished
even
among
the
works
of
nature
instead
of
being
lost
as
the
fate
of
the
most
splendid
efforts
of
human
labour
must
have
been
among
those
tremendous
mountains
which
they
had
so
lately
traversed
they
were
yet
a
mile
from
the
entrance
of
the
city
when
the
party
was
met
by
one
of
the
magistrates
attended
by
two
or
three
citizens
mounted
on
mules
the
velvet
housings
of
which
expressed
wealth
and
quality
they
greeted
the
landamman
of
unterwalden
and
his
party
in
a
respectful
manner
and
the
latter
prepared
themselves
to
hear
and
make
a
suitable
reply
to
the
hospitable
invitation
which
they
naturally
expected
to
receive
the
message
of
the
community
of
bâle
was
however
diametrically
opposite
to
what
they
had
anticipated
it
was
delivered
with
a
good
deal
of
diffidence
and
hesitation
by
the
functionary
who
met
them
and
who
certainly
while
discharging
his
commission
did
not
appear
to
consider
it
as
the
most
respectable
which
he
might
have
borne
there
were
many
professions
of
the
most
profound
and
fraternal
regard
for
the
cities
of
the
helvetian
league
with
whom
the
orator
of
bâle
declared
his
own
state
to
be
united
in
friendship
and
interests
but
he
ended
by
intimating
that
on
account
of
certain
cogent
and
weighty
reasons
which
should
be
satisfactorily
explained
at
more
leisure
the
free
city
of
bâle
could
not
this
evening
receive
within
its
walls
the
highly
respected
deputies
who
were
travelling
at
the
command
of
the
helvetian
diet
to
the
court
of
the
duke
of
burgundy
philipson
marked
with
much
interest
the
effect
which
this
most
unexpected
intimation
produced
on
the
members
of
the
embassage
rudolph
donnerhugel
who
had
joined
their
company
as
they
approached
bâle
appeared
less
surprised
than
his
associates
and
while
he
remained
perfectly
silent
seemed
rather
anxious
to
penetrate
their
sentiments
than
disposed
to
express
his
own
it
was
not
the
first
time
the
sagacious
merchant
had
observed
that
this
bold
and
fiery
young
man
could
when
his
purposes
required
it
place
a
strong
constraint
upon
the
natural
impetuosity
of
his
temper
for
the
others
the
banneret
brow
darkened
the
face
of
the
burgess
of
soleure
became
flushed
like
the
moon
when
rising
in
the
the
deputy
of
schwitz
looked
anxiously
on
arnold
biederman
and
the
landamman
himself
seemed
more
moved
than
was
usual
in
a
person
of
his
equanimity
at
length
he
replied
to
the
functionary
of
bâle
in
a
voice
somewhat
altered
by
his
feelings
this
is
a
singular
message
to
the
deputies
of
the
swiss
confederacy
bound
as
we
are
upon
an
amicable
mission
on
which
depends
the
interest
of
the
good
citizens
of
bâle
whom
we
have
always
treated
as
our
good
friends
and
who
still
profess
to
be
so
the
shelter
of
their
roofs
the
protection
of
their
walls
the
wonted
intercourse
of
hospitality
is
what
no
friendly
state
hath
a
right
to
refuse
to
the
inhabitants
of
another
nor
is
it
with
their
will
that
the
community
of
bâle
refuse
it
worthy
landamman
replied
the
magistrate
not
you
alone
and
your
worthy
associates
but
your
escort
and
your
very
beasts
of
burden
should
be
entertained
with
all
the
kindness
which
the
citizens
of
bâle
could
bestow
but
we
act
under
constraint
and
by
whom
exercised
said
the
banneret
bursting
out
into
passion
has
the
emperor
sigismund
profited
so
little
by
the
example
of
his
predecessors
the
emperor
replied
the
delegate
of
bâle
interrupting
the
banneret
is
a
and
peaceful
monarch
as
he
has
been
ever
but
there
are
burgundian
troops
of
late
marched
into
the
sundgaw
and
messages
have
been
sent
to
our
state
from
count
archibald
of
hagenbach
enough
said
replied
the
landamman
draw
not
farther
the
veil
from
a
weakness
for
which
you
blush
i
comprehend
you
entirely
bâle
lies
too
near
the
citadel
of
la
ferette
to
permit
its
citizens
to
consult
their
own
inclinations
brother
we
see
where
your
difficulty
lies
we
pity
you
and
we
forgive
your
inhospitality
nay
but
hear
me
to
an
end
worthy
landamman
answered
the
magistrate
there
is
here
in
the
vicinity
an
old
of
the
counts
of
falkenstein
called
which
though
ruinous
yet
may
afford
better
lodgings
than
the
open
air
and
is
capable
of
some
defence
though
heaven
forbid
that
any
one
should
dare
to
intrude
upon
your
repose
and
hark
ye
hither
my
worthy
friends
if
you
find
in
the
old
place
some
refreshments
as
wine
beer
and
the
like
use
them
without
scruple
for
they
are
there
for
your
accommodation
i
do
not
refuse
to
occupy
a
place
of
security
said
the
landamman
for
although
the
causing
us
to
be
excluded
from
bâle
may
be
only
done
in
the
spirit
of
petty
insolence
and
malice
yet
it
may
also
for
what
we
can
tell
be
connected
with
some
purpose
of
violence
your
provisions
we
thank
you
for
but
we
will
not
with
my
consent
feed
at
the
cost
of
friends
who
are
ashamed
to
own
us
unless
by
stealth
one
thing
more
my
worthy
sir
said
the
official
of
bâle
you
have
a
maiden
in
company
who
i
presume
to
think
is
your
daughter
there
is
but
rough
accommodation
where
you
are
going
even
for
men
for
women
there
is
little
better
though
what
we
could
we
have
done
to
arrange
matters
as
well
as
may
be
but
rather
let
your
daughter
go
with
us
back
to
bâle
where
my
dame
will
be
a
mother
to
her
till
next
morning
when
i
will
bring
her
to
your
camp
in
safety
we
promised
to
shut
our
gates
against
the
men
of
the
confederacy
but
the
women
were
not
mentioned
you
are
subtle
casuists
you
men
of
bâle
answered
the
landamman
but
know
that
from
the
time
in
which
the
helvetians
sallied
forth
to
encounter
cæsar
down
to
the
present
hour
the
women
of
switzerland
in
the
press
of
danger
have
had
their
abode
in
the
camp
of
their
fathers
brothers
and
husbands
and
sought
no
further
safety
than
they
might
find
in
the
courage
of
their
relations
we
have
enough
of
men
to
protect
our
women
and
my
niece
shall
remain
with
us
and
take
the
fate
which
heaven
may
send
us
adieu
then
worthy
friend
said
the
magistrate
of
bâle
it
grieves
me
to
part
with
you
thus
but
evil
fate
will
have
it
so
yonder
grassy
avenue
will
conduct
you
to
the
old
where
heaven
send
that
you
may
pass
a
quiet
night
for
apart
from
other
risks
men
say
that
these
ruins
have
no
good
name
will
you
yet
permit
your
niece
since
such
the
young
person
is
to
pass
to
bâle
for
the
night
in
my
company
if
we
are
disturbed
by
beings
like
ourselves
said
arnold
biederman
we
have
strong
arms
and
heavy
partisans
if
we
should
be
visited
as
your
words
would
imply
by
those
of
a
different
description
we
have
or
should
have
good
consciences
and
confidence
in
good
friends
my
brethren
on
this
embassy
have
i
spoken
your
sentiments
as
well
as
mine
own
the
other
deputies
intimated
their
assent
to
what
their
companion
had
said
and
the
citizens
of
bâle
took
a
courteous
farewell
of
their
guests
endeavouring
by
the
excess
of
civility
to
atone
for
their
deficiency
in
effective
hospitality
after
their
departure
rudolph
was
the
first
to
express
his
sense
of
their
pusillanimous
behaviour
on
which
he
had
been
silent
during
their
presence
coward
dogs
he
said
may
the
butcher
of
burgundy
flay
the
very
skins
from
them
with
his
exactions
to
teach
them
to
disown
old
friendships
rather
than
abide
the
lightest
blast
of
a
tyrant
anger
and
not
even
their
own
tyrant
either
said
another
of
the
group
for
several
of
the
young
men
had
gathered
round
their
seniors
to
hear
the
welcome
which
they
expected
from
the
magistrates
of
bâle
no
replied
ernest
one
of
arnold
biederman
sons
they
do
not
pretend
that
their
own
prince
the
emperor
hath
interfered
with
them
but
a
word
of
the
duke
of
burgundy
which
should
be
no
more
to
them
than
a
breath
of
wind
from
the
west
is
sufficient
to
stir
them
to
such
brutal
inhospitality
it
were
well
to
march
to
the
city
and
compel
them
at
the
sword
point
to
give
us
shelter
a
murmur
of
applause
arose
amongst
the
youth
around
which
awakened
the
displeasure
of
arnold
biederman
did
i
hear
he
said
the
tongue
of
a
son
of
mine
or
was
it
that
of
a
brutish
lanzknecht
who
has
no
pleasure
but
in
battle
or
violence
where
is
the
modesty
of
the
youth
of
switzerland
who
were
wont
to
wait
the
signal
for
action
till
it
pleased
the
elders
of
the
canton
to
give
it
and
were
as
gentle
as
maidens
till
the
voice
of
their
patriarchs
bade
them
be
bold
as
lions
i
meant
no
harm
father
said
ernest
abashed
with
this
rebuke
far
less
any
slight
towards
you
but
i
must
needs
say
say
not
a
word
my
son
replied
arnold
but
leave
our
camp
by
break
of
day
and
as
thou
takest
thy
way
back
to
geierstein
to
which
i
command
thine
instant
return
remember
that
he
is
not
fit
to
visit
strange
countries
who
can
not
rule
his
tongue
before
his
own
countrymen
and
to
his
own
father
the
banneret
of
berne
the
burgess
of
soleure
even
the
deputy
from
schwitz
endeavoured
to
intercede
for
the
offender
and
obtain
a
remission
of
his
banishment
but
it
was
in
vain
no
my
good
friends
and
brethren
no
replied
arnold
these
young
men
require
an
example
and
though
i
am
grieved
in
one
sense
that
the
offence
has
chanced
within
my
own
family
yet
i
am
pleased
in
another
light
that
the
delinquent
should
be
one
over
whom
i
can
exercise
full
authority
without
suspicion
of
ernest
my
son
thou
hast
heard
my
commands
return
to
geierstein
with
the
morning
light
and
let
me
find
thee
an
altered
man
when
i
return
thither
the
young
swiss
who
was
evidently
much
hurt
and
shocked
at
this
public
affront
placed
one
knee
on
the
ground
and
kissed
his
father
right
hand
while
arnold
without
the
slightest
sign
of
anger
bestowed
his
blessing
upon
him
and
ernest
without
a
word
of
remonstrance
fell
into
the
rear
of
the
party
the
deputation
then
proceeded
down
the
avenue
which
had
been
pointed
out
to
them
and
at
the
bottom
of
which
arose
the
massy
ruins
of
but
there
was
not
enough
of
daylight
remaining
to
discern
their
exact
form
they
could
observe
as
they
drew
nearer
and
as
the
night
became
darker
that
three
or
four
windows
were
lighted
up
while
the
rest
of
the
front
remained
obscured
in
gloom
when
they
arrived
at
the
place
they
perceived
it
was
surrounded
by
a
large
and
deep
moat
the
sullen
surface
of
which
reflected
though
faintly
the
glimmer
of
the
lights
within
footnotes
a
private
soldier
of
the
german
infantry
chapter
ix
give
you
o
farewell
honest
soldier
who
hath
relieved
you
give
you
bernardo
hath
my
place
the
first
occupation
of
our
travellers
was
to
find
the
means
of
crossing
the
moat
and
they
were
not
long
of
discovering
the
de
on
which
the
drawbridge
when
lowered
had
formerly
rested
the
bridge
itself
had
been
long
decayed
but
a
temporary
passage
of
and
planks
had
been
constructed
apparently
very
lately
which
admitted
them
to
the
chief
entrance
of
the
castle
on
entering
it
they
found
a
wicket
opening
under
the
archway
which
glimmering
with
light
served
to
guide
them
to
a
hall
prepared
evidently
for
their
accommodation
as
well
as
circumstances
had
admitted
of
a
large
fire
of
wood
burned
blithely
in
the
chimney
and
had
been
maintained
so
long
there
that
the
air
of
the
hall
notwithstanding
its
great
size
and
somewhat
ruinous
aspect
felt
mild
and
genial
there
was
also
at
the
end
of
the
apartment
a
stack
of
wood
large
enough
to
maintain
the
fire
had
they
been
to
remain
there
a
week
two
or
three
long
tables
in
the
hall
stood
covered
and
ready
for
their
reception
and
on
looking
more
closely
several
large
hampers
were
found
in
a
corner
containing
cold
provisions
of
every
kind
prepared
with
great
care
for
their
immediate
use
the
eyes
of
the
good
burgess
of
soleure
twinkled
when
he
beheld
the
young
men
in
the
act
of
transferring
the
supper
from
the
hampers
and
arranging
it
on
the
table
well
said
he
these
poor
men
of
bâle
have
saved
their
character
since
if
they
have
fallen
short
in
welcome
they
have
abounded
in
good
cheer
ah
friend
said
arnold
biederman
the
absence
of
the
landlord
is
a
great
deduction
from
the
entertainment
better
half
an
apple
from
the
hand
of
your
host
than
a
bridal
feast
without
his
company
we
owe
them
the
less
for
their
banquet
said
the
banneret
but
from
the
doubtful
language
they
held
i
should
judge
it
meet
to
keep
a
strong
guard
and
even
that
some
of
our
young
men
should
from
time
to
time
patrol
around
the
old
ruins
the
place
is
strong
and
defensible
and
so
far
our
thanks
are
due
to
those
who
have
acted
as
our
we
will
however
with
your
permission
my
honoured
brethren
examine
the
house
within
and
then
arrange
regular
guards
and
to
your
duty
then
young
men
and
search
these
ruins
carefully
they
may
perchance
contain
more
than
ourselves
for
we
are
now
near
one
who
like
a
pilfering
fox
moves
more
willingly
by
night
than
by
day
and
seeks
his
prey
amidst
ruins
and
wildernesses
rather
than
in
the
open
field
all
agreed
to
this
proposal
the
young
men
took
torches
of
which
a
good
provision
had
been
left
for
their
use
and
made
a
strict
search
through
the
ruins
the
greater
part
of
the
castle
was
much
more
wasted
and
ruinous
than
the
portion
which
the
citizens
of
bâle
seemed
to
have
destined
for
the
accommodation
of
the
embassy
some
parts
were
roofless
and
the
whole
desolate
the
glare
of
light
the
gleam
of
arms
the
sound
of
the
human
voice
and
echoes
of
mortal
tread
startled
from
their
dark
recesses
bats
owls
and
other
birds
of
ill
omen
the
usual
inhabitants
of
such
edifices
whose
flight
through
the
desolate
chambers
repeatedly
occasioned
alarm
amongst
those
who
heard
the
noise
without
seeing
the
cause
and
shouts
of
laughter
when
it
became
known
they
discovered
that
the
deep
moat
surrounded
their
place
of
retreat
on
all
sides
and
of
course
that
they
were
in
safety
against
any
attack
which
could
be
made
from
without
except
it
was
attempted
by
the
main
entrance
which
it
was
easy
to
barricade
and
guard
with
sentinels
they
also
ascertained
by
strict
search
that
though
it
was
possible
an
individual
might
be
concealed
amid
such
a
waste
of
ruins
yet
it
was
altogether
impossible
that
any
number
which
might
be
formidable
to
so
large
a
party
as
their
own
could
have
remained
there
without
a
certainty
of
discovery
these
particulars
were
reported
to
the
banneret
who
directed
donnerhugel
to
take
charge
of
a
body
of
six
of
the
young
men
such
as
he
should
himself
choose
to
patrol
on
the
outside
of
the
building
till
the
first
and
at
that
hour
to
return
to
the
castle
when
the
same
number
were
to
take
the
duty
till
morning
dawned
and
then
be
relieved
in
their
turn
rudolph
declared
his
own
intention
to
remain
on
guard
the
whole
night
and
as
he
was
equally
remarkable
for
vigilance
as
for
strength
and
courage
the
external
watch
was
considered
as
safely
provided
for
it
being
settled
that
in
case
of
any
sudden
reencounter
the
deep
and
hoarse
sound
of
the
swiss
bugle
should
be
the
signal
for
sending
support
to
the
patrolling
party
within
side
the
castle
the
precautions
were
taken
with
equal
vigilance
a
sentinel
to
be
relieved
every
two
hours
was
appointed
to
take
post
at
the
principal
gate
and
other
two
kept
watch
on
the
other
side
of
the
castle
although
the
moat
appeared
to
insure
safety
in
that
quarter
these
precautions
being
taken
the
remainder
of
the
party
sat
down
to
refresh
themselves
the
deputies
occupying
the
upper
part
of
the
hall
while
those
of
their
escort
modestly
arranged
themselves
in
the
lower
end
of
the
same
large
apartment
quantities
of
hay
and
straw
which
were
left
piled
in
the
wide
castle
were
put
to
the
purpose
for
which
undoubtedly
they
had
been
destined
by
the
citizens
of
bâle
and
with
the
aid
of
cloaks
and
mantles
were
judged
excellent
good
bedding
by
a
hardy
race
who
in
war
or
the
chase
were
often
well
satisfied
with
a
much
worse
night
lair
the
attention
of
the
bâlese
had
even
gone
so
far
as
to
provide
for
anne
of
geierstein
separate
accommodation
more
suitable
to
her
use
than
that
assigned
to
the
men
of
the
party
an
apartment
which
had
probably
been
the
buttery
of
the
castle
entered
from
the
hall
and
had
also
a
doorway
leading
out
into
a
passage
connected
with
the
ruins
but
this
last
had
hastily
yet
carefully
been
built
up
with
large
hewn
stones
taken
from
the
ruins
without
mortar
indeed
or
any
other
cement
but
so
well
secured
by
their
own
weight
that
an
attempt
to
displace
them
must
have
alarmed
not
only
any
one
who
might
be
in
the
apartment
itself
but
also
those
who
were
in
the
hall
adjacent
or
indeed
in
any
part
of
the
castle
in
the
small
room
thus
carefully
arranged
and
secured
there
were
two
and
a
large
fire
which
blazed
on
the
hearth
and
gave
warmth
and
comfort
to
the
apartment
even
the
means
of
devotion
were
not
forgotten
a
small
crucifix
of
bronze
being
hung
over
a
table
on
which
lay
a
breviary
those
who
first
discovered
this
little
place
of
retreat
came
back
loud
in
praise
of
the
delicacy
of
the
citizens
of
bâle
who
while
preparing
for
the
general
accommodation
of
the
strangers
had
not
failed
to
provide
separately
and
peculiarly
for
that
of
their
female
companion
arnold
biederman
felt
the
kindness
of
this
conduct
we
should
pity
our
friends
of
bâle
and
not
nourish
resentment
against
them
he
said
they
have
stretched
their
kindness
towards
us
as
far
as
their
personal
apprehensions
permitted
and
that
is
saying
no
small
matter
for
them
my
masters
for
no
passion
is
so
unutterably
selfish
as
that
of
anne
my
love
thou
art
fatigued
go
to
the
retreat
provided
for
you
and
lizette
shall
bring
you
from
this
abundant
mass
of
provisions
what
will
be
fittest
for
your
evening
meal
so
saying
he
led
his
niece
into
the
little
bedroom
and
looking
round
with
an
air
of
complacency
wished
her
good
repose
but
there
was
something
on
the
maiden
brow
which
seemed
to
augur
that
her
uncle
wishes
would
not
be
fulfilled
from
the
moment
she
had
left
switzerland
her
looks
had
become
clouded
her
intercourse
with
those
who
approached
her
had
grown
more
brief
and
rare
her
whole
appearance
was
marked
with
secret
anxiety
or
secret
sorrow
this
did
not
escape
her
uncle
who
naturally
imputed
it
to
the
pain
of
parting
from
him
which
was
probably
soon
to
take
place
and
to
her
regret
at
leaving
the
tranquil
spot
in
which
so
many
years
of
her
youth
had
been
spent
but
anne
of
geierstein
had
no
sooner
entered
the
apartment
than
her
whole
frame
trembled
violently
and
the
colour
leaving
her
cheeks
entirely
she
sank
down
on
one
of
the
pallets
where
resting
her
elbows
on
her
knees
and
pressing
her
hands
on
her
forehead
she
rather
resembled
a
person
borne
down
by
mental
distress
or
oppressed
by
some
severe
illness
than
one
who
tired
with
a
journey
was
in
haste
to
betake
herself
to
needful
rest
arnold
was
not
quicksighted
as
to
the
many
sources
of
female
passion
he
saw
that
his
niece
suffered
but
imputing
it
only
to
the
causes
already
mentioned
augmented
by
the
hysterical
effects
often
produced
by
fatigue
he
gently
blamed
her
for
having
departed
from
her
character
of
a
swiss
maiden
ere
she
was
yet
out
of
reach
of
a
swiss
breeze
of
wind
thou
must
not
let
the
dames
of
germany
or
flanders
think
that
our
daughters
have
degenerated
from
their
mothers
else
must
we
fight
the
battles
of
sempach
and
laupen
over
again
to
convince
the
emperor
and
this
haughty
duke
of
burgundy
that
our
men
are
of
the
same
mettle
with
their
forefathers
and
as
for
our
parting
i
do
not
fear
it
my
brother
is
a
count
of
the
empire
indeed
and
therefore
he
must
needs
satisfy
himself
that
everything
over
which
he
possesses
any
title
shall
be
at
his
command
and
sends
for
thee
to
prove
his
right
of
doing
so
but
i
know
him
well
he
will
no
sooner
be
satisfied
that
he
may
command
thy
attendance
at
pleasure
than
he
will
concern
himself
about
thee
no
more
thee
alas
poor
thing
in
what
couldst
thou
aid
his
courtly
intrigues
and
ambitious
plans
no
no
thou
art
not
for
the
noble
count
purpose
and
must
be
content
to
trudge
back
to
rule
the
dairy
at
geierstein
and
be
the
darling
of
thine
old
peasantlike
uncle
would
to
god
we
were
there
even
now
said
the
maiden
in
a
tone
of
wretchedness
which
she
strove
in
vain
to
conceal
or
suppress
that
may
hardly
be
till
we
have
executed
the
purpose
which
brought
us
hither
said
the
literal
landamman
but
lay
thee
on
thy
pallet
anne
take
a
morsel
of
food
and
three
drops
of
wine
and
thou
wilt
wake
as
gay
as
on
a
swiss
holiday
when
the
pipe
sounds
the
réveille
anne
was
now
able
to
plead
a
severe
headache
and
declining
all
refreshment
which
she
declared
herself
incapable
of
tasting
she
bade
her
uncle
she
then
desired
lizette
to
get
some
food
for
herself
cautioning
her
as
she
returned
to
make
as
little
noise
as
possible
and
not
to
break
her
repose
if
she
should
have
the
good
fortune
to
fall
asleep
arnold
biederman
then
kissed
his
niece
and
returned
to
the
hall
where
his
colleagues
in
office
were
impatient
to
commence
an
attack
on
the
provisions
which
were
in
readiness
to
which
the
escort
of
young
men
diminished
by
the
patrols
and
sentinels
were
no
less
disposed
than
their
seniors
the
signal
of
assault
was
given
by
the
deputy
from
schwitz
the
eldest
of
the
party
pronouncing
in
patriarchal
form
a
benediction
over
the
meal
the
travellers
then
commenced
their
operations
with
a
vivacity
which
showed
that
the
uncertainty
whether
they
should
get
any
food
and
the
delays
which
had
occurred
in
arranging
themselves
in
their
quarters
had
infinitely
increased
their
appetites
even
the
landamman
whose
moderation
sometimes
approached
to
abstinence
seemed
that
night
in
a
more
genial
humour
than
ordinary
his
friend
of
schwitz
after
his
example
ate
drank
and
spoke
more
than
usual
while
the
rest
of
the
deputies
pushed
their
meal
to
the
verge
of
a
carousal
the
elder
philipson
marked
the
scene
with
an
attentive
and
anxious
eye
confining
his
applications
to
the
to
such
pledges
as
the
politeness
of
the
times
called
upon
him
to
reply
to
his
son
had
left
the
hall
just
as
the
banquet
began
in
the
manner
which
we
are
now
to
relate
arthur
had
proposed
to
himself
to
join
the
youths
who
were
to
perform
the
duty
of
sentinels
within
or
patrols
on
the
outside
of
their
place
of
repose
and
had
indeed
made
some
arrangement
for
that
purpose
with
sigismund
the
third
of
the
landamman
sons
but
while
about
to
steal
a
parting
glance
at
anne
of
geierstein
before
offering
his
service
as
he
proposed
there
appeared
on
her
brow
such
a
deep
and
solemn
expression
as
diverted
his
thoughts
from
every
other
subject
excepting
the
anxious
doubts
as
to
what
could
possibly
have
given
rise
to
such
a
change
the
placid
openness
of
brow
the
eye
which
expressed
conscious
and
fearless
innocence
the
lips
which
seconded
by
a
look
as
frank
as
her
words
seemed
ever
ready
to
speak
in
kindness
and
in
confidence
that
which
the
heart
dictated
were
for
the
moment
entirely
changed
in
character
and
expression
and
in
a
degree
and
manner
for
which
no
ordinary
cause
could
satisfactorily
account
fatigue
might
have
banished
the
rose
from
the
maiden
beautiful
complexion
and
sickness
or
pain
might
have
dimmed
her
eye
and
clouded
her
brow
but
the
look
of
deep
dejection
with
which
she
fixed
her
eyes
at
times
on
the
ground
and
the
startled
and
terrified
glance
which
she
cast
around
her
at
other
intervals
must
have
had
their
rise
in
some
different
source
neither
could
illness
or
weariness
explain
the
manner
in
which
her
lips
were
contracted
or
compressed
together
like
one
who
makes
up
her
mind
to
act
or
behold
something
that
is
fearful
or
account
for
the
tremor
which
seemed
at
times
to
steal
over
her
insensibly
though
by
a
strong
effort
she
was
able
at
intervals
to
throw
it
off
for
this
change
of
expression
there
must
be
in
the
heart
some
deeply
melancholy
and
afflicting
cause
what
could
that
cause
be
it
is
dangerous
for
youth
to
behold
beauty
in
the
pomp
of
all
her
charms
with
every
look
bent
upon
conquest
more
dangerous
to
see
her
in
the
hour
of
unaffected
and
unapprehensive
ease
and
simplicity
yielding
herself
to
the
graceful
whim
of
the
moment
and
as
willing
to
be
pleased
as
desirous
of
pleasing
there
are
minds
which
may
be
still
more
affected
by
gazing
on
beauty
in
sorrow
and
feeling
that
pity
that
desire
of
comforting
the
lovely
mourner
which
the
poet
has
described
as
so
nearly
akin
to
love
but
to
a
spirit
of
that
romantic
and
adventurous
cast
which
the
middle
ages
frequently
produced
the
sight
of
a
young
and
amiable
person
evidently
in
a
state
of
terror
and
suffering
which
had
no
visible
cause
was
perhaps
still
more
impressive
than
beauty
in
her
pride
her
tenderness
or
her
sorrow
such
sentiments
it
must
be
remembered
were
not
confined
to
the
highest
ranks
only
but
might
then
be
found
in
all
classes
of
society
which
were
raised
above
the
mere
peasant
or
artisan
young
philipson
gazed
on
anne
of
geierstein
with
such
intense
curiosity
mingled
with
pity
and
tenderness
that
the
bustling
scene
around
him
seemed
to
vanish
from
his
eyes
and
leave
no
one
in
the
noisy
hall
save
himself
and
the
object
of
his
interest
what
could
it
be
that
so
evidently
oppressed
and
almost
quailed
a
spirit
so
well
balanced
and
a
courage
so
well
tempered
when
being
guarded
by
the
swords
of
the
bravest
men
perhaps
to
be
found
in
europe
and
lodged
in
a
place
of
strength
even
the
most
timid
of
her
sex
might
have
found
confidence
surely
if
an
attack
were
to
be
made
upon
them
the
clamour
of
a
conflict
in
such
circumstances
could
scarce
be
more
terrific
than
the
roar
of
those
cataracts
which
he
had
seen
her
despise
at
least
he
thought
she
ought
to
be
aware
that
there
is
one
who
is
bound
by
friendship
and
gratitude
to
fight
to
the
death
in
her
defence
would
to
heaven
he
continued
in
the
same
reverie
it
were
possible
to
convey
to
her
without
sign
or
speech
the
assurance
of
my
unalterable
resolution
to
protect
her
in
the
worst
of
perils
as
such
thoughts
streamed
through
his
mind
anne
raised
her
eyes
in
one
of
those
fits
of
deep
feeling
which
seemed
to
overwhelm
her
and
while
she
cast
them
round
the
hall
with
a
look
of
apprehension
as
if
she
expected
to
see
amid
the
companions
of
her
journey
some
strange
and
unwelcome
apparition
they
encountered
the
fixed
and
anxious
gaze
of
young
philipson
they
were
instantly
bent
on
the
ground
while
a
deep
blush
showed
how
much
she
was
conscious
of
having
attracted
his
attention
by
her
previous
deportment
arthur
on
his
part
with
equal
consciousness
blushed
as
deeply
as
the
maiden
herself
and
drew
himself
back
from
her
observation
but
when
anne
rose
up
and
was
escorted
by
her
uncle
to
her
bedchamber
in
the
manner
we
have
already
mentioned
it
seemed
to
philipson
as
if
she
had
carried
with
her
from
the
apartment
the
lights
with
which
it
was
illuminated
and
left
it
in
the
twilight
melancholy
of
some
funeral
hall
his
deep
musings
were
pursuing
the
subject
which
occupied
them
thus
anxiously
when
the
manly
voice
of
donnerhugel
spoke
close
in
his
ear
what
comrade
has
our
journey
fatigued
you
so
much
that
you
go
to
sleep
upon
your
feet
now
heaven
forbid
hauptman
said
the
englishman
starting
from
his
reverie
and
addressing
rudolph
by
this
name
signifying
captain
or
literally
which
the
youth
of
the
expedition
had
by
unanimous
consent
bestowed
on
him
heaven
forbid
i
should
sleep
if
there
be
aught
like
action
in
the
wind
where
dost
thou
propose
to
be
at
said
the
swiss
where
duty
shall
call
me
or
your
experience
noble
hauptman
shall
appoint
replied
arthur
but
with
your
leave
i
purposed
to
take
sigismund
guard
on
the
bridge
till
midnight
or
morning
dawn
he
still
feels
the
sprain
which
he
received
in
his
spring
after
yonder
chamois
and
i
persuaded
him
to
take
some
uninterrupted
rest
as
the
best
mode
of
restoring
his
strength
he
will
do
well
to
keep
his
counsel
then
again
whispered
donnerhugel
the
old
landamman
is
not
a
man
to
make
allowances
for
mishaps
when
they
interfere
with
duty
those
who
are
under
his
orders
should
have
as
few
brains
as
a
bull
as
strong
limbs
as
a
bear
and
be
as
impassible
as
lead
or
iron
to
all
the
casualties
of
life
and
all
the
weaknesses
of
humanity
arthur
replied
in
the
same
tone
i
have
been
the
landamman
guest
for
some
time
and
have
seen
no
specimens
of
any
such
rigid
discipline
you
are
a
stranger
said
the
swiss
and
the
old
man
has
too
much
hospitality
to
lay
you
under
the
least
restraint
you
are
a
volunteer
too
in
whatever
share
you
choose
to
take
in
our
sports
or
our
military
duty
and
therefore
when
i
ask
you
to
walk
abroad
with
me
at
the
first
it
is
only
in
the
event
that
such
exercise
shall
entirely
consist
with
your
own
pleasure
i
consider
myself
as
under
your
command
for
the
time
said
philipson
but
not
to
bandy
courtesy
at
i
shall
be
relieved
from
my
watch
on
the
drawbridge
and
will
be
by
that
time
glad
to
exchange
the
post
for
a
more
extended
walk
do
you
not
choose
more
of
this
fatiguing
and
probably
unnecessary
duty
than
may
befit
your
strength
said
rudolph
i
take
no
more
than
you
do
said
arthur
as
you
propose
not
to
take
rest
till
morning
true
answered
donnerhugel
but
i
am
a
swiss
and
i
answered
philipson
quickly
am
an
englishman
i
did
not
mean
what
i
said
in
the
sense
you
take
it
said
rudolph
laughing
i
only
meant
that
i
am
more
interested
in
this
matter
than
you
can
be
who
are
a
stranger
to
the
cause
in
which
we
are
personally
engaged
i
am
a
stranger
no
doubt
replied
arthur
but
a
stranger
who
has
enjoyed
your
hospitality
and
who
therefore
claims
a
right
while
with
you
to
a
share
in
your
labours
and
dangers
be
it
so
said
rudolph
donnerhugel
i
shall
have
finished
my
first
rounds
at
the
hour
when
the
sentinels
at
the
castle
are
relieved
and
shall
be
ready
to
recommence
them
in
your
good
company
content
said
the
englishman
and
now
i
will
to
my
post
for
i
suspect
sigismund
is
blaming
me
already
as
oblivious
of
my
promise
they
hastened
together
to
the
gate
where
sigismund
willingly
yielded
up
his
weapon
and
his
guard
to
young
philipson
confirming
the
idea
sometimes
entertained
of
him
that
he
was
the
most
indolent
and
least
spirited
of
the
family
of
geierstein
rudolph
could
not
suppress
his
displeasure
what
would
the
landamman
say
he
demanded
if
he
saw
thee
thus
quietly
yield
up
post
and
partisan
to
a
stranger
he
would
say
i
did
well
answered
the
young
man
nothing
daunted
for
he
is
for
ever
reminding
us
to
let
the
stranger
have
his
own
way
in
everything
and
english
arthur
stands
on
this
bridge
by
his
own
wish
and
no
asking
of
therefore
kind
arthur
since
thou

and

i
make
thee
welcome
with

my
heart

your

you
are
to
stop
all
who

or
attempt
to

or
till
they

if
they

you
must

but
you
will
suffer
such
of
our
friends
as
are
known
to
you
to
pass
outwards
without
challenge
or
alarm
because
the
deputation
may
find
occasion
to
send
messengers
abroad
a
murrain
on
thee
thou
lazy
losel
said
rudolph
thou
art
the
only
sluggard
of
thy
kin
then
am
i
the
only
wise
man
of
them
all
said
the
hark
ye
brave
hauptman
ye
have
supped
this
evening
have
ye
not
it
is
a
point
of
wisdom
ye
owl
answered
the
bernese
not
to
go
into
the
forest
fasting
if
it
is
wisdom
to
eat
when
we
are
hungry
answered
sigismund
there
can
be
no
folly
in
sleeping
when
we
are
weary
so
saying
and
after
a
desperate
yawn
or
two
the
relieved
sentinel
halted
off
giving
full
effect
to
the
sprain
of
which
he
complained
yet
there
is
strength
in
those
loitering
limbs
and
valour
in
that
indolent
and
sluggish
spirit
said
rudolph
to
the
englishman
but
it
is
time
that
i
who
censure
others
should
betake
me
to
my
own
hither
comrades
of
the
watch
hither
the
bernese
accompanied
these
words
with
a
whistle
which
brought
from
within
six
young
men
whom
he
had
previously
chosen
for
the
duty
and
who
after
a
hurried
supper
now
waited
his
summons
one
or
two
of
them
had
large
bloodhounds
or
which
though
usually
employed
in
the
pursuit
of
animals
of
chase
were
also
excellent
for
discovering
ambuscades
in
which
duty
their
services
were
now
to
be
employed
one
of
these
animals
was
held
in
a
leash
by
the
person
who
forming
the
advance
of
the
party
went
about
twenty
yards
in
front
of
them
a
second
was
the
property
of
donnerhugel
himself
who
had
the
creature
singularly
under
command
three
of
his
companions
attended
him
closely
and
the
two
others
followed
one
of
whom
bore
a
horn
of
the
bernese
wild
bull
by
way
of
bugle
this
little
party
crossed
the
moat
by
the
temporary
bridge
and
moved
on
to
the
verge
of
the
forest
which
lay
adjacent
to
the
castle
and
the
skirts
of
which
were
most
likely
to
conceal
any
ambuscade
that
could
be
apprehended
the
moon
was
now
up
and
near
the
full
so
that
arthur
from
the
elevation
on
which
the
castle
stood
could
trace
their
slow
cautious
march
amid
the
broad
silver
light
until
they
were
lost
in
the
depths
of
the
forest
when
this
object
had
ceased
to
occupy
his
eyes
the
thoughts
of
his
lonely
watch
again
returned
to
anne
of
geierstein
and
to
the
singular
expression
of
distress
and
apprehension
which
had
that
evening
clouded
her
beautiful
features
then
the
blush
which
had
chased
for
the
moment
paleness
and
terror
from
her
countenance
at
the
instant
his
eyes
encountered
hers
was
it
anger
was
it
modesty
was
it
some
softer
feeling
more
gentle
than
the
one
more
tender
than
the
other
young
philipson
who
like
chaucer
squire
was
as
modest
as
a
maid
almost
trembled
to
give
to
that
look
the
favourable
interpretation
which
a
more
gallant
would
have
applied
to
it
without
scruple
no
hue
of
rising
or
setting
day
was
ever
so
lovely
in
the
eyes
of
the
young
man
as
that
blush
was
in
his
recollection
nor
did
ever
enthusiastic
visionary
or
poetical
dreamer
find
out
so
many
fanciful
forms
in
the
clouds
as
arthur
divined
various
interpretations
from
the
indications
of
interest
which
had
passed
over
the
beautiful
countenance
of
the
swiss
maiden
in
the
meantime
the
thought
suddenly
burst
on
his
reverie
that
it
could
little
concern
him
what
was
the
cause
of
the
perturbation
she
had
exhibited
they
had
met
at
no
distant
period
for
the
first
time
they
must
soon
part
for
ever
she
could
be
nothing
more
to
him
than
the
remembrance
of
a
beautiful
vision
and
he
could
have
no
other
part
in
her
memory
save
as
a
stranger
from
a
foreign
land
who
had
been
a
sojourner
for
a
season
in
her
uncle
house
but
whom
she
could
never
expect
to
see
again
when
this
idea
intruded
on
the
train
of
romantic
visions
which
agitated
him
it
was
like
the
sharp
stroke
of
the
harpoon
which
awakens
the
whale
from
slumbering
torpidity
into
violent
action
the
gateway
in
which
the
young
soldier
kept
his
watch
seemed
suddenly
too
narrow
for
him
he
rushed
across
the
temporary
bridge
and
hastily
traversed
a
short
space
of
ground
in
front
of
the
de
or
defensive
work
on
which
its
outer
extremity
rested
here
for
a
time
he
paced
the
narrow
extent
to
which
he
was
confined
by
his
duty
as
a
sentinel
with
long
and
rapid
strides
as
if
he
had
been
engaged
by
vow
to
take
the
greatest
possible
quantity
of
exercise
upon
that
limited
space
of
ground
his
exertion
however
produced
the
effect
of
in
some
degree
composing
his
mind
recalling
him
to
himself
and
reminding
him
of
the
numerous
reasons
which
prohibited
his
fixing
his
attention
much
more
his
affections
upon
this
young
person
however
fascinating
she
was
i
have
surely
he
thought
as
he
slackened
his
pace
and
shouldered
his
heavy
partisan
sense
enough
left
to
recollect
my
condition
and
my
duties
to
think
of
my
father
to
whom
i
am
all
in
all
and
to
think
also
on
the
dishonour
which
must
accrue
to
me
were
i
capable
of
winning
the
affections
of
a
and
confiding
girl
to
whom
i
could
never
do
justice
by
dedicating
my
life
to
return
them
no
he
said
to
himself
she
will
soon
forget
me
and
i
will
study
to
remember
her
no
otherwise
than
i
would
a
pleasing
dream
which
hath
for
a
moment
crossed
a
night
of
perils
and
dangers
such
as
my
life
seems
doomed
to
be
as
he
spoke
he
stopped
short
in
his
walk
and
as
he
rested
on
his
weapon
a
tear
rose
unbidden
to
his
eye
and
stole
down
his
cheek
without
being
wiped
away
but
he
combated
this
gentler
mood
of
passion
as
he
had
formerly
battled
with
that
which
was
of
a
wilder
and
more
desperate
character
shaking
off
the
dejection
and
sinking
of
spirit
which
he
felt
creeping
upon
him
he
resumed
at
the
same
time
the
air
and
attitude
of
an
attentive
sentinel
and
recalled
his
mind
to
the
duties
of
his
watch
which
in
the
tumult
of
his
feelings
he
had
almost
forgotten
but
what
was
his
astonishment
when
as
he
looked
out
on
the
clear
landscape
there
passed
from
the
bridge
towards
the
forest
crossing
him
in
the
broad
moonlight
the
living
and
moving
likeness
of
anne
of
geierstein
chapter
x
we
know
not
when
we
sleep
nor
when
we
wake
visions
distinct
and
perfect
cross
our
eye
which
to
the
slumberer
seem
realities
and
while
they
waked
some
men
have
seen
such
sights
as
set
at
naught
the
evidence
of
sense
and
left
them
well
persuaded
they
were
dreaming
anonymous
the
apparition
of
anne
of
geierstein
crossed
her
lover
her
admirer
at
least
we
must
call
him
within
shorter
time
than
we
can
tell
the
story
but
it
was
distinct
perfect
and
undoubted
in
the
very
instant
when
the
young
englishman
shaking
off
his
fond
despondency
raised
his
head
to
look
out
upon
the
scene
of
his
watch
she
came
from
the
nearer
end
of
the
bridge
crossing
the
path
of
the
sentinel
upon
whom
she
did
not
even
cast
a
look
and
passed
with
a
rapid
yet
steady
pace
towards
the
verge
of
the
woodland
it
would
have
been
natural
though
arthur
had
been
directed
not
to
challenge
persons
who
left
the
castle
but
only
such
as
might
approach
it
that
he
should
nevertheless
had
it
only
been
in
mere
civility
have
held
some
communication
however
slight
with
the
maiden
as
she
crossed
his
post
but
the
suddenness
of
her
appearance
took
from
him
for
the
instant
both
speech
and
motion
it
seemed
as
if
his
own
imagination
had
raised
up
a
phantom
presenting
to
his
outward
senses
the
form
and
features
which
engrossed
his
mind
and
he
was
silent
partly
at
least
from
the
idea
that
what
he
gazed
upon
was
immaterial
and
not
of
this
world
it
would
have
been
no
less
natural
that
anne
of
geierstein
should
have
in
some
manner
acknowledged
the
person
who
had
spent
a
considerable
time
under
the
same
roof
with
her
had
been
often
her
partner
in
the
dance
and
her
companion
in
the
field
but
she
did
not
evince
the
slightest
token
of
recognition
nor
even
look
towards
him
as
she
passed
her
eye
was
on
the
wood
to
which
she
advanced
swiftly
and
steadily
and
she
was
hidden
by
its
boughs
ere
arthur
had
recollected
himself
sufficiently
to
determine
what
to
do
his
first
feeling
was
anger
at
himself
for
suffering
her
to
pass
unquestioned
when
it
might
well
chance
that
upon
any
errand
which
called
her
forth
at
so
extraordinary
a
time
and
place
he
might
have
been
enabled
to
afford
her
assistance
or
at
least
advice
this
sentiment
was
for
a
short
time
so
predominant
that
he
ran
towards
the
place
where
he
had
seen
the
skirt
of
her
dress
disappear
and
whispering
her
name
as
loud
as
the
fear
of
alarming
the
castle
permitted
conjured
her
to
return
and
hear
him
but
for
a
few
brief
moments
no
answer
however
was
returned
and
when
the
branches
of
the
trees
began
to
darken
over
his
head
and
to
intercept
the
moonlight
he
recollected
that
he
was
leaving
his
post
and
exposing
his
who
were
trusting
in
his
vigilance
to
the
danger
of
surprise
he
hastened
therefore
back
to
the
castle
gate
with
matter
for
deeper
and
more
inextricable
doubt
and
anxiety
than
had
occupied
him
during
the
commencement
of
his
watch
he
asked
himself
in
vain
with
what
purpose
that
modest
young
maiden
whose
manners
were
frank
but
whose
conduct
had
always
seemed
so
delicate
and
reserved
could
sally
forth
at
midnight
like
a
in
romance
when
she
was
in
a
strange
country
and
suspicious
neighbourhood
yet
he
rejected
as
he
would
have
shrunk
from
blasphemy
any
interpretation
which
could
have
thrown
censure
upon
anne
of
geierstein
no
nothing
was
she
capable
of
doing
for
which
a
friend
could
have
to
blush
but
connecting
her
previous
agitation
with
the
extraordinary
fact
of
her
leaving
the
castle
alone
and
defenceless
at
such
an
hour
arthur
necessarily
concluded
it
must
argue
some
cogent
reason
and
as
was
most
likely
of
an
unpleasant
i
will
watch
her
return
he
internally
uttered
and
if
she
will
give
me
an
opportunity
i
will
convey
to
her
the
assurance
that
there
is
one
faithful
bosom
in
her
neighbourhood
which
is
bound
in
honour
and
gratitude
to
pour
out
every
drop
of
its
blood
if
by
doing
so
it
can
protect
her
from
the
slightest
inconvenience
this
is
no
silly
flight
of
romance
for
which
has
a
right
to
reproach
me
it
is
only
what
i
ought
to
do
what
i
must
do
or
forego
every
claim
to
be
termed
a
man
of
honesty
or
honour
yet
scarce
did
the
young
man
think
himself
anchored
on
a
resolution
which
seemed
unobjectionable
than
his
thoughts
were
again
adrift
he
reflected
that
anne
might
have
a
desire
to
visit
the
neighbouring
town
of
bâle
to
which
she
had
been
invited
the
day
before
and
where
her
uncle
had
friends
it
was
indeed
an
uncommon
hour
to
select
for
such
a
purpose
but
arthur
was
aware
that
the
swiss
maidens
feared
neither
solitary
walks
nor
late
hours
and
that
anne
would
have
walked
among
her
own
hills
by
moonlight
much
farther
than
the
distance
betwixt
their
place
of
encampment
and
bâle
to
see
a
sick
friend
or
for
any
similar
purpose
to
press
himself
on
her
confidence
then
might
be
impertinence
not
kindness
and
as
she
had
passed
him
without
taking
the
slightest
notice
of
his
presence
it
was
evident
she
did
not
mean
voluntarily
to
make
him
her
confidant
and
probably
she
was
involved
in
no
difficulties
where
his
aid
could
be
useful
in
that
case
the
duty
of
a
gentleman
was
to
permit
her
to
return
as
she
had
gone
forth
unnoticed
and
unquestioned
leaving
it
with
herself
to
hold
communication
with
him
or
not
as
she
should
choose
another
idea
belonging
to
the
age
also
passed
through
his
mind
though
it
made
no
strong
impression
upon
it
this
form
so
perfectly
resembling
anne
of
geierstein
might
be
a
deception
of
the
sight
or
it
might
be
one
of
those
fantastic
apparitions
concerning
which
there
were
so
many
tales
told
in
all
countries
and
of
which
switzerland
and
germany
had
as
arthur
well
knew
their
full
share
the
internal
and
undefinable
feelings
which
restrained
him
from
accosting
the
maiden
as
might
have
been
natural
for
him
to
have
done
are
easily
explained
on
the
supposition
that
his
mortal
frame
shrank
from
an
encounter
with
a
being
of
a
different
nature
there
had
also
been
some
expressions
of
the
magistrate
of
bâle
which
might
apply
to
the
castle
being
liable
to
be
haunted
by
beings
from
another
world
but
though
the
general
belief
in
such
ghostly
apparitions
prevented
the
englishman
from
being
positively
incredulous
on
the
subject
yet
the
instructions
of
his
father
a
man
of
great
intrepidity
and
distinguished
good
sense
had
taught
him
to
be
extremely
unwilling
to
refer
anything
to
supernatural
interferences
which
was
capable
of
explanation
by
ordinary
rules
and
he
therefore
shook
off
without
difficulty
any
feelings
of
superstitious
fear
which
for
an
instant
connected
itself
with
his
nocturnal
adventure
he
resolved
finally
to
suppress
all
disquieting
conjecture
on
the
subject
and
to
await
firmly
if
not
patiently
the
return
of
the
fair
vision
which
if
it
should
not
fully
explain
the
mystery
seemed
at
least
to
afford
the
only
chance
of
throwing
light
upon
it
fixed
therefore
in
purpose
he
traversed
the
walk
which
his
duty
permitted
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
part
of
the
forest
where
he
had
seen
the
beloved
form
disappear
and
forgetful
for
the
moment
that
his
watch
had
any
other
purpose
than
to
observe
her
return
but
from
this
abstraction
of
mind
he
was
roused
by
a
distant
sound
in
the
forest
which
seemed
the
clash
of
armour
recalled
at
once
to
a
sense
of
his
duty
and
its
importance
to
his
father
and
his
arthur
planted
himself
on
the
temporary
bridge
where
a
stand
could
best
be
made
and
turned
both
eyes
and
ears
to
watch
for
approaching
danger
the
sound
of
arms
and
footsteps
came
nearer
spears
and
helmets
advanced
from
the
greenwood
glade
and
twinkled
in
the
moonlight
but
the
stately
form
of
rudolph
donnerhugel
marching
in
front
was
easily
recognised
and
announced
to
our
sentinel
the
return
of
the
patrol
upon
their
approach
to
the
bridge
the
challenge
and
interchange
of
sign
and
countersign
which
is
usual
on
such
occasions
took
place
in
due
form
and
as
rudolph
party
filed
off
one
after
another
into
the
castle
he
commanded
them
to
wake
their
companions
with
whom
he
intended
to
renew
the
patrol
and
at
the
same
time
to
send
a
relief
to
arthur
philipson
whose
watch
on
the
bridge
was
now
ended
this
last
fact
was
confirmed
by
the
deep
and
distant
toll
of
the
minster
clock
from
the
town
of
bâle
which
prolonging
its
sullen
sound
over
field
and
forest
announced
that
midnight
was
past
and
now
comrade
continued
rudolph
to
the
englishman
have
the
cold
air
and
long
watch
determined
thee
to
retire
to
food
and
rest
or
dost
thou
still
hold
the
intention
of
partaking
our
rounds
in
very
truth
it
would
have
been
arthur
choice
to
have
remained
in
the
place
where
he
was
for
the
purpose
of
watching
anne
of
geierstein
return
from
her
mysterious
excursion
he
could
not
easily
have
found
an
excuse
for
this
however
and
he
was
unwilling
to
give
the
haughty
donnerhugel
the
least
suspicion
that
he
was
inferior
in
hardihood
or
in
the
power
of
enduring
fatigue
to
any
of
the
tall
mountaineers
whose
companion
he
chanced
to
be
for
the
present
he
did
not
therefore
indulge
even
a
moment
hesitation
but
while
he
restored
the
borrowed
partisan
to
the
sluggish
sigismund
who
came
from
the
castle
yawning
and
stretching
himself
like
one
whose
slumbers
had
been
broken
by
no
welcome
summons
when
they
were
deepest
and
sweetest
he
acquainted
rudolph
that
he
retained
his
purpose
of
partaking
in
his
reconnoitring
duty
they
were
speedily
joined
by
the
rest
of
the
patrolling
party
amongst
whom
was
rudiger
the
eldest
son
of
the
landamman
of
unterwalden
and
when
led
by
the
bernese
champion
they
had
reached
the
skirts
of
the
forest
rudolph
commanded
three
of
them
to
attend
rudiger
biederman
thou
wilt
make
thy
round
to
the
left
side
said
the
bernese
i
will
draw
off
to
the
right
see
thou
keepest
a
good
and
we
will
meet
merrily
at
the
place
appointed
take
one
of
the
hounds
with
you
i
will
keep
who
will
open
on
a
burgundian
as
readily
as
on
a
bear
rudiger
moved
off
with
his
party
to
the
left
according
to
the
directions
received
and
rudolph
having
sent
forward
one
of
his
number
in
front
and
stationed
another
in
the
rear
commanded
the
third
to
follow
himself
and
arthur
philipson
who
thus
constituted
the
main
body
of
the
patrol
having
intimated
to
their
immediate
attendant
to
keep
at
such
distance
as
to
allow
them
freedom
of
conversation
rudolph
addressed
the
englishman
with
the
familiarity
which
their
recent
friendship
had
and
now
king
arthur
what
thinks
the
majesty
of
england
of
our
helvetian
youth
could
they
win
guerdon
in
tilt
or
tourney
thinkest
thou
noble
prince
or
would
they
rank
but
amongst
the
coward
knights
of
cornouailles
for
tilt
and
tourney
i
can
not
answer
said
arthur
summoning
up
his
spirits
to
reply
because
i
never
beheld
one
of
you
mounted
on
a
steed
or
having
spear
in
rest
but
if
strong
limbs
and
stout
hearts
are
to
be
considered
i
would
match
you
swiss
gallants
with
those
of
any
country
in
the
universe
where
manhood
is
to
be
looked
for
whether
it
be
in
heart
or
hand
thou
speakest
us
fair
and
young
englishman
said
rudolph
know
that
we
think
as
highly
of
thee
of
which
i
will
presently
afford
thee
a
proof
thou
talkedst
but
now
of
horses
i
know
but
little
of
them
yet
i
judge
thou
wouldst
not
buy
a
steed
which
thou
hadst
only
seen
covered
with
trappings
or
encumbered
with
saddle
and
bridle
but
wouldst
desire
to
look
at
him
when
stripped
and
in
his
natural
state
of
freedom
ay
marry
would
i
said
arthur
thou
hast
spoken
on
that
as
if
thou
hadst
been
born
in
a
district
called
yorkshire
which
men
call
the
merriest
part
of
merry
england
then
i
tell
thee
said
rudolph
donnerhugel
that
thou
hast
seen
our
swiss
youth
but
half
since
thou
hast
observed
them
as
yet
only
in
their
submissive
attendance
upon
the
elders
of
their
cantons
or
at
most
in
their
which
though
they
may
show
outward
strength
and
activity
can
throw
no
light
on
the
spirit
and
disposition
by
which
that
strength
and
activity
are
to
be
guided
and
directed
in
matters
of
high
enterprise
the
swiss
probably
designed
that
these
remarks
should
excite
the
curiosity
of
the
stranger
but
the
englishman
had
the
image
look
and
form
of
anne
of
geierstein
as
she
had
passed
him
in
the
silent
hours
of
his
watch
too
constantly
before
him
to
enter
willingly
upon
a
subject
of
conversation
totally
foreign
to
what
agitated
his
mind
he
therefore
only
compelled
himself
to
reply
in
civility
that
he
had
no
doubt
his
esteem
for
the
swiss
both
aged
and
young
would
increase
in
proportion
with
his
more
intimate
knowledge
of
the
nation
he
was
then
silent
and
donnerhugel
disappointed
perhaps
at
having
failed
to
excite
his
curiosity
walked
also
in
silence
by
his
side
arthur
meanwhile
was
considering
with
himself
whether
he
should
mention
to
his
companion
the
circumstance
which
occupied
his
own
mind
in
the
hope
that
the
kinsman
of
anne
of
geierstein
and
ancient
friend
of
her
house
might
be
able
to
throw
some
light
on
the
subject
but
he
felt
within
his
mind
an
insurmountable
objection
to
converse
with
the
swiss
on
a
subject
in
which
anne
was
concerned
that
rudolph
made
pretensions
to
her
favour
could
hardly
be
doubted
and
though
arthur
had
the
question
been
put
to
him
must
in
common
consistency
have
resigned
all
competition
on
the
subject
still
he
could
not
bear
to
think
on
the
possibility
of
his
rival
success
and
would
not
willingly
have
endured
to
hear
him
pronounce
her
name
perhaps
it
was
owing
to
this
secret
irritability
that
arthur
though
he
made
every
effort
to
conceal
and
to
overcome
the
sensation
still
felt
a
secret
dislike
to
rudolph
donnerhugel
whose
frank
but
somewhat
coarse
familiarity
was
mingled
with
a
certain
air
of
protection
and
patronage
which
the
englishman
thought
was
by
no
means
called
for
he
met
the
openness
of
the
bernese
indeed
with
equal
frankness
but
he
was
ever
and
anon
tempted
to
reject
or
repel
the
tone
of
superiority
by
which
it
was
accompanied
the
circumstances
of
their
duel
had
given
the
swiss
no
ground
for
such
triumph
nor
did
arthur
feel
himself
included
in
that
roll
of
the
swiss
youth
over
whom
rudolph
exercised
domination
by
general
consent
so
little
did
philipson
relish
this
affectation
of
superiority
that
the
poor
jest
that
termed
him
king
arthur
although
quite
indifferent
to
him
when
applied
by
any
of
the
biedermans
was
rather
offensive
when
rudolph
took
the
same
liberty
so
that
he
often
found
himself
in
the
awkward
condition
of
one
who
is
internally
irritated
without
having
any
outward
manner
of
testifying
it
with
propriety
undoubtedly
the
root
of
all
this
tacit
dislike
to
the
young
bernese
was
a
feeling
of
rivalry
but
it
was
a
feeling
which
arthur
dared
not
avow
even
to
himself
it
was
sufficiently
powerful
however
to
suppress
the
slight
inclination
he
had
felt
to
speak
with
rudolph
on
the
passage
of
the
night
which
had
most
interested
him
and
as
the
topic
of
conversation
introduced
by
his
companion
had
been
suffered
to
drop
they
walked
on
side
by
side
in
silence
with
the
beard
on
the
shoulder
as
the
spaniard
says
looking
round
that
is
on
all
hands
and
thus
performing
the
duty
of
a
vigilant
watch
at
length
after
they
had
walked
nearly
a
mile
through
forest
and
field
making
a
circuit
around
the
ruins
of
of
such
an
extent
as
to
leave
no
room
for
an
ambush
betwixt
them
and
the
place
the
old
hound
led
by
the
vidette
who
was
foremost
stopped
and
uttered
a
low
growl
how
now
said
rudolph
what
old
fellow
dost
thou
not
know
friends
from
foes
come
what
sayest
thou
on
better
thoughts
thou
must
not
lose
character
in
thy
old
age
try
it
again
the
dog
raised
his
head
snuffed
the
air
all
around
as
if
he
understood
what
his
master
had
said
then
shook
his
head
and
tail
as
if
answering
to
his
voice
why
there
it
is
now
said
donnerhugel
patting
the
animal
shaggy
back
second
thoughts
are
worth
gold
thou
seest
it
is
a
friend
after
all
the
dog
again
shook
his
tail
and
moved
forward
with
the
same
unconcern
as
before
rudolph
fell
back
into
his
place
and
his
companion
said
to
him
we
are
about
to
meet
rudiger
and
our
companions
i
suppose
and
the
dog
hears
their
footsteps
though
we
can
not
it
can
scarcely
yet
be
rudiger
said
the
bernese
his
walk
around
the
castle
is
of
a
wider
circumference
than
ours
some
one
approaches
however
for
is
again
dissatisfied
look
sharply
out
on
all
sides
as
rudolph
gave
his
party
the
word
to
be
on
the
alert
they
reached
an
open
glade
in
which
were
scattered
at
considerable
distance
from
each
other
some
old
of
gigantic
size
which
seemed
yet
huger
and
blacker
than
ordinary
from
their
broad
sable
tops
and
shattered
branches
being
displayed
against
the
clear
and
white
moonlight
we
shall
here
at
least
said
the
swiss
have
the
advantage
of
seeing
clearly
whatever
approaches
but
i
judge
said
he
after
looking
around
for
a
minute
it
is
but
some
wolf
or
deer
that
has
crossed
our
path
and
the
scent
disturbs
the
hound
hold
stop
yes
it
must
be
so
he
goes
on
the
dog
accordingly
proceeded
after
having
given
some
signs
of
doubt
uncertainty
and
even
anxiety
apparently
however
he
became
reconciled
to
what
had
disturbed
him
and
proceeded
once
more
in
the
ordinary
manner
this
is
singular
said
arthur
philipson
and
to
my
thinking
i
saw
an
object
close
by
yonder
patch
of
thicket
where
as
well
as
i
can
guess
a
few
thorn
and
hazel
bushes
surround
the
stems
of
four
or
five
large
trees
my
eye
has
been
on
that
very
thicket
for
these
five
minutes
past
and
i
saw
nothing
said
rudolph
nay
but
answered
the
young
englishman
i
saw
the
object
whatever
it
was
while
you
were
engaged
in
attending
to
the
dog
and
by
your
permission
i
will
forward
and
examine
the
spot
were
you
strictly
speaking
under
my
command
said
donnerhugel
i
would
command
you
to
keep
your
place
if
they
be
foes
it
is
essential
that
we
should
remain
together
but
you
are
a
volunteer
in
our
watch
and
therefore
may
use
your
freedom
i
thank
you
answered
arthur
and
sprang
quickly
forward
he
felt
indeed
at
the
moment
that
he
was
not
acting
courteously
as
an
individual
nor
perhaps
correctly
as
a
soldier
and
that
he
ought
to
have
rendered
obedience
for
the
time
to
the
captain
of
the
party
in
which
he
had
enlisted
himself
but
on
the
other
hand
the
object
which
he
had
seen
though
at
a
distance
and
imperfectly
seemed
to
bear
a
resemblance
to
the
retiring
form
of
anne
of
geierstein
as
she
had
vanished
from
his
eyes
an
hour
or
two
before
under
the
cover
of
the
forest
and
his
ungovernable
curiosity
to
ascertain
whether
it
might
not
be
the
maiden
in
person
allowed
him
to
listen
to
no
other
consideration
ere
rudolph
had
spoken
out
his
few
words
of
reply
arthur
was
halfway
to
the
thicket
it
was
as
it
had
seemed
at
a
distance
of
small
extent
and
not
fitted
to
hide
any
person
who
did
not
actually
couch
down
amongst
the
dwarf
bushes
and
underwood
anything
white
also
which
bore
the
human
size
and
form
must
he
thought
have
been
discovered
among
the
stems
and
bushes
which
were
before
him
these
observations
were
mingled
with
other
thoughts
if
it
was
anne
of
geierstein
whom
he
had
a
second
time
seen
she
must
have
left
the
more
open
path
desirous
probably
of
avoiding
notice
and
what
right
or
title
had
he
to
direct
upon
her
the
observation
of
the
patrol
he
had
he
thought
observed
that
in
general
the
maiden
rather
repelled
than
encouraged
the
attentions
of
rudolph
donnerhugel
or
where
it
would
have
been
discourteous
to
have
rejected
them
entirely
that
she
endured
without
encouraging
them
what
then
could
be
the
propriety
of
his
intruding
upon
her
private
walk
singular
indeed
from
time
and
place
but
which
on
that
account
she
might
be
more
desirous
to
keep
secret
from
the
observation
of
one
who
was
disagreeable
to
her
nay
was
it
not
possible
that
rudolph
might
derive
advantage
to
his
otherwise
unacceptable
suit
by
possessing
the
knowledge
of
something
which
the
maiden
desired
to
be
concealed
as
these
thoughts
pressed
upon
him
arthur
made
a
pause
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
thicket
from
which
he
was
now
scarce
thirty
yards
distant
and
although
scrutinising
it
with
all
the
keen
accuracy
which
his
uncertainty
and
anxiety
dictated
he
was
actuated
by
a
strong
feeling
that
it
would
be
wisest
to
turn
back
to
his
companions
and
report
to
rudolph
that
his
eyes
had
deceived
him
but
while
he
was
yet
undecided
whether
to
advance
or
return
the
object
which
he
had
seen
became
again
visible
on
the
verge
of
the
thicket
and
advanced
straight
towards
him
bearing
as
on
the
former
occasion
the
exact
dress
and
figure
of
anne
of
geierstein
this
vision
for
the
time
place
and
suddenness
of
the
appearance
made
it
seem
rather
an
illusion
than
a
reality
struck
arthur
with
surprise
which
amounted
to
terror
the
figure
passed
within
a
unchallenged
by
him
and
giving
not
the
slightest
sign
of
recognition
and
directing
its
course
to
the
right
hand
of
rudolph
and
the
two
or
three
who
were
with
him
was
again
lost
among
the
broken
ground
and
bushes
once
more
the
young
man
was
reduced
to
a
state
of
the
most
inextricable
doubt
nor
was
he
roused
from
the
stupor
into
which
he
was
thrown
till
the
voice
of
the
bernese
sounded
in
his
ear
why
how
now
king
arthur
art
thou
asleep
or
art
thou
wounded
neither
said
philipson
collecting
himself
only
much
surprised
surprised
and
at
what
most
royal
forbear
foolery
said
arthur
somewhat
sternly
and
answer
as
thou
art
a
man
did
she
not
meet
thee
didst
thou
not
see
her
see
her
see
whom
said
donnerhugel
i
saw
no
one
and
i
could
have
sworn
you
had
seen
no
one
either
for
i
had
you
in
my
eye
the
whole
time
of
your
absence
excepting
two
or
three
moments
if
you
saw
aught
why
gave
you
not
the
alarm
because
it
was
only
a
woman
answered
arthur
faintly
only
a
woman
repeated
rudolph
in
a
tone
of
contempt
by
my
honest
word
king
arthur
if
i
had
not
seen
pretty
flashes
of
valour
fly
from
thee
at
times
i
should
be
apt
to
think
that
thou
hadst
only
a
courage
thyself
strange
that
a
shadow
by
night
or
a
precipice
in
the
day
should
quell
so
bold
a
spirit
as
thou
hast
often
shown
and
as
i
will
ever
show
when
occasion
demands
it
interrupted
the
englishman
with
recovered
spirit
but
i
swear
to
you
that
if
i
be
now
daunted
it
is
by
no
mere
earthly
fears
that
my
mind
hath
been
for
a
moment
subdued
let
us
proceed
on
our
walk
said
rudolph
we
must
not
neglect
the
safety
of
our
friends
this
appearance
of
which
thou
speakest
may
be
but
a
trick
to
interrupt
our
duty
they
moved
on
through
the
moonlight
glades
a
minute
reflection
restored
young
philipson
to
his
full
recollection
and
with
that
to
the
painful
consciousness
that
he
had
played
a
ridiculous
and
unworthy
part
in
the
presence
of
the
person
whom
of
the
male
sex
at
least
he
would
the
very
last
have
chosen
as
a
witness
of
his
weakness
he
ran
hastily
over
the
relations
which
stood
betwixt
himself
donnerhugel
the
landamman
his
niece
and
the
rest
of
that
family
and
contrary
to
the
opinion
which
he
had
entertained
but
a
short
while
before
settled
in
his
own
mind
that
it
was
his
duty
to
mention
to
the
immediate
leader
under
whom
he
had
placed
himself
the
appearance
which
he
had
twice
observed
in
the
course
of
that
duty
there
might
be
family
circumstances
the
payment
of
a
vow
perhaps
or
some
such
reason
which
might
render
intelligible
to
her
connections
the
behaviour
of
this
young
lady
besides
he
was
for
the
present
a
soldier
on
duty
and
these
mysteries
might
be
fraught
with
evils
to
be
anticipated
or
guarded
against
in
either
case
his
companions
were
entitled
to
be
made
aware
of
what
he
had
seen
it
must
be
supposed
that
this
resolution
was
adopted
when
the
sense
of
duty
and
of
shame
for
the
weakness
which
he
had
exhibited
had
for
the
moment
subdued
arthur
personal
feelings
towards
anne
of
geierstein
feelings
also
liable
to
be
chilled
by
the
mysterious
uncertainty
which
the
events
of
that
evening
had
cast
like
a
thick
mist
around
the
object
of
them
while
the
englishman
reflections
were
taking
this
turn
his
captain
or
companion
after
a
silence
of
several
minutes
at
length
addressed
him
i
believe
he
said
my
dear
comrade
that
as
being
at
present
your
officer
i
have
some
title
to
hear
from
you
the
report
of
what
you
have
just
now
seen
since
it
must
be
something
of
importance
which
could
so
strongly
agitate
a
mind
so
firm
as
yours
but
if
in
your
own
opinion
it
consists
with
the
general
safety
to
delay
your
report
of
what
you
have
seen
until
we
return
to
the
castle
and
then
to
deliver
it
to
the
private
ear
of
the
landamman
you
have
only
to
intimate
your
purpose
and
far
from
urging
you
to
place
confidence
in
me
personally
though
i
hope
i
am
not
undeserving
of
it
i
will
authorise
your
leaving
us
and
returning
instantly
to
the
castle
this
proposal
touched
him
to
whom
it
was
made
exactly
in
the
right
place
an
absolute
demand
of
his
confidence
might
perhaps
have
been
declined
the
tone
of
moderate
request
and
conciliation
fell
presently
in
with
the
englishman
own
reflections
i
am
sensible
he
said
hauptman
that
i
ought
to
mention
to
you
that
which
i
have
seen
but
on
the
first
occasion
it
did
not
fall
within
my
duty
to
do
so
and
now
that
i
have
a
second
time
witnessed
the
same
appearance
i
have
felt
for
these
few
seconds
so
much
surprised
at
what
i
have
seen
that
even
yet
i
can
scarce
find
words
to
express
it
as
i
can
not
guess
what
you
may
have
to
say
replied
the
bernese
i
must
beseech
you
to
be
explicit
we
are
but
poor
readers
of
riddles
we
switzers
yet
it
is
but
a
riddle
which
i
have
to
place
before
you
rudolph
donnerhugel
answered
the
englishman
and
a
riddle
which
is
far
beyond
my
own
guessing
at
he
then
proceeded
though
not
without
hesitation
while
you
were
performing
your
first
patrol
amongst
the
ruins
a
female
crossed
the
bridge
from
within
the
castle
walked
by
my
post
without
saying
a
single
word
and
vanished
under
the
shadows
of
the
forest
ha
exclaimed
donnerhugel
and
made
no
further
answer
arthur
proceeded
within
these
five
minutes
the
same
female
form
passed
me
a
second
time
issuing
from
the
little
thicket
and
clump
of
firs
and
disappeared
without
exchanging
a
word
know
further
this
apparition
bore
the
form
face
gait
and
dress
of
your
kinswoman
anne
of
geierstein
singular
enough
said
rudolph
in
a
tone
of
incredulity
i
must
not
i
suppose
dispute
your
word
for
you
would
receive
doubt
on
my
part
as
a
mortal
injury
such
is
your
northern
chivalry
yet
let
me
say
i
have
eyes
as
well
as
you
and
i
scarce
think
they
quitted
you
for
a
minute
we
were
not
fifty
yards
from
the
place
where
i
found
you
standing
in
amazement
how
therefore
should
not
we
also
have
seen
that
which
you
say
and
think
you
saw
to
that
i
can
give
no
answer
said
arthur
perhaps
your
eyes
were
not
exactly
turned
upon
me
during
the
short
space
in
which
i
saw
this
form
perhaps
it
might
be
visible
as
they
say
fantastic
appearances
sometimes
are
to
only
one
person
at
a
time
you
suppose
then
that
the
appearance
was
imaginary
or
fantastic
said
the
bernese
can
i
tell
you
replied
the
englishman
the
church
gives
its
warrant
that
there
are
such
things
and
surely
it
is
more
natural
to
believe
this
apparition
to
be
an
illusion
than
to
suppose
that
anne
of
geierstein
a
gentle
and
maiden
should
be
traversing
the
woods
at
this
wild
hour
when
safety
and
propriety
so
strongly
recommend
her
being
within
doors
there
is
much
in
what
you
say
said
rudolph
and
yet
there
are
stories
afloat
though
few
care
to
mention
them
which
seem
to
allege
that
anne
of
geierstein
is
not
altogether
such
as
other
maidens
and
that
she
has
been
met
with
in
body
and
spirit
where
she
could
hardly
have
come
by
her
own
unassisted
efforts
ha
said
arthur
so
young
so
beautiful
and
already
in
league
with
the
destroyer
of
mankind
it
is
impossible
i
said
not
so
replied
the
bernese
nor
have
i
leisure
at
present
to
explain
my
meaning
more
fully
as
we
return
to
the
castle
of
i
may
have
an
opportunity
to
tell
you
more
but
i
chiefly
brought
you
on
this
patrol
to
introduce
you
to
some
friends
whom
you
will
be
pleased
to
know
and
who
desire
your
acquaintance
and
it
is
here
i
expect
to
meet
them
so
saying
he
turned
round
the
projecting
corner
of
a
rock
and
an
unexpected
scene
was
presented
to
the
eyes
of
the
young
englishman
in
a
sort
of
nook
or
corner
screened
by
the
rocky
projection
there
burned
a
large
fire
of
wood
and
around
it
sat
reclined
or
lay
twelve
or
fifteen
young
men
in
the
swiss
garb
but
decorated
with
ornaments
and
embroidery
which
reflected
back
the
light
of
the
fire
the
same
red
gleam
was
returned
by
silver
which
circulated
from
hand
to
hand
with
the
flasks
which
filled
them
arthur
could
also
observe
the
relics
of
a
banquet
to
which
due
honour
seemed
to
have
been
lately
rendered
the
revellers
started
joyfully
up
at
the
sight
of
donnerhugel
and
his
companions
and
saluted
him
easily
distinguished
as
he
was
by
his
stature
by
the
title
of
captain
warmly
and
exultingly
uttered
while
at
the
same
time
every
tendency
to
noisy
acclamation
was
cautiously
suppressed
the
zeal
indicated
that
rudolph
came
most
welcome
the
caution
that
he
came
in
secret
and
was
to
be
received
with
mystery
to
the
general
greeting
he
answered
i
thank
you
my
brave
comrades
has
rudiger
yet
reached
you
thou
seest
he
has
not
said
one
of
the
party
had
it
been
so
we
would
have
detained
him
here
till
your
coming
brave
captain
he
has
loitered
on
his
patrol
said
the
bernese
we
too
were
delayed
yet
we
are
here
before
him
i
bring
with
me
comrades
the
brave
englishman
whom
i
mentioned
to
you
as
a
desirable
associate
in
our
daring
purpose
he
is
welcome
most
welcome
to
us
said
a
young
man
whose
richly
embroidered
dress
of
azure
blue
gave
him
an
air
of
authority
most
welcome
is
he
if
he
brings
with
him
a
heart
and
a
hand
to
serve
our
noble
task
for
both
i
will
be
responsible
said
rudolph
pass
the
then
to
the
success
of
our
glorious
enterprise
and
the
health
of
this
our
new
associate
while
they
were
replenishing
the
cups
with
wine
of
a
quality
far
superior
to
any
which
arthur
had
yet
tasted
in
these
regions
he
thought
it
right
before
engaging
himself
in
the
pledge
to
learn
the
secret
object
of
the
association
which
seemed
desirous
of
adopting
him
before
i
engage
my
poor
services
to
you
fair
sirs
since
it
pleases
you
to
desire
them
permit
me
he
said
to
ask
the
purpose
and
character
of
the
undertaking
in
which
they
are
to
be
employed
shouldst
thou
have
brought
him
hither
said
the
cavalier
in
blue
to
rudolph
without
satisfying
him
and
thyself
on
that
point
care
not
thou
about
it
lawrenz
replied
the
bernese
i
know
my
be
it
known
then
to
you
my
good
friend
he
continued
addressing
the
englishman
that
my
comrades
and
i
are
determined
at
once
to
declare
the
freedom
of
the
swiss
commerce
and
to
resist
to
the
death
if
it
be
necessary
all
unlawful
and
extortionate
demands
on
the
part
of
our
neighbours
i
understand
so
much
said
the
young
englishman
and
that
the
present
deputation
proceeds
to
the
duke
of
burgundy
with
remonstrances
to
that
effect
hear
me
replied
rudolph
the
question
is
like
to
be
brought
to
a
bloody
determination
long
ere
we
see
the
duke
of
burgundy
most
august
and
most
gracious
countenance
that
his
influence
should
be
used
to
exclude
us
from
bâle
a
neutral
town
and
pertaining
to
the
empire
gives
us
cause
to
expect
the
worst
reception
when
we
enter
his
own
dominions
we
have
even
reason
to
think
that
we
might
have
suffered
from
his
hatred
already
but
for
the
vigilance
of
the
ward
which
we
have
kept
horsemen
from
the
direction
of
la
ferette
have
this
night
reconnoitred
our
posts
and
had
they
not
found
us
prepared
we
had
without
question
been
attacked
in
our
quarters
but
since
we
have
escaped
we
must
take
care
for
for
this
purpose
a
number
of
the
bravest
youth
of
the
city
of
bâle
incensed
at
the
pusillanimity
of
their
magistrates
are
determined
to
join
us
in
order
to
wipe
away
the
disgrace
which
the
cowardly
inhospitality
of
their
magistracy
has
brought
on
their
native
place
that
we
will
do
ere
the
sun
that
will
rise
two
hours
hence
shall
sink
into
the
western
sky
said
the
cavalier
in
blue
and
those
around
joined
him
in
stern
assent
gentle
sirs
replied
arthur
when
there
was
a
pause
let
me
remind
you
that
the
embassy
which
you
attend
is
a
peaceful
one
and
that
those
who
act
as
its
escort
ought
to
avoid
anything
which
can
augment
the
differences
which
it
comes
to
reconcile
you
can
not
expect
to
receive
offence
in
the
duke
dominions
the
privileges
of
envoys
being
respected
in
all
civilised
countries
and
you
will
i
am
sure
desire
to
offer
none
we
may
be
subjected
to
insult
however
replied
the
bernese
and
that
through
your
concerns
arthur
philipson
and
those
of
thy
father
i
understand
you
not
replied
philipson
your
father
answered
donnerhugel
is
a
merchant
and
bears
with
him
wares
of
small
bulk
but
high
value
he
does
so
answered
arthur
and
what
of
that
marry
answered
rudolph
that
if
it
be
not
better
looked
to
the
bandog
of
burgundy
is
like
to
fall
heir
to
a
large
proportion
of
your
silks
satins
and
jewellery
work
silks
satins
and
jewels
exclaimed
another
of
the
revellers
such
wares
will
not
pass
where
archibald
of
hagenbach
hath
authority
fair
sirs
resumed
arthur
after
a
moment
consideration
these
wares
are
my
father
property
not
mine
and
it
is
for
him
not
me
to
pronounce
how
much
of
them
he
might
be
content
to
part
with
in
the
way
of
toll
rather
than
give
occasion
to
a
fray
in
which
his
companions
who
have
received
him
into
their
society
must
be
exposed
to
injury
as
well
as
himself
i
can
only
say
that
he
has
weighty
affairs
at
the
court
of
burgundy
which
must
render
him
desirous
of
reaching
it
in
peace
with
all
men
and
it
is
my
private
belief
that
rather
than
incur
the
loss
and
danger
of
a
broil
with
the
garrison
of
la
ferette
he
would
be
contented
to
sacrifice
all
the
property
which
he
has
at
present
with
him
therefore
i
must
request
of
you
gentlemen
a
space
to
consult
his
pleasure
on
this
occasion
assuring
you
that
if
it
be
his
will
to
resist
the
payment
of
these
duties
to
burgundy
you
shall
find
in
me
one
who
is
fully
determined
to
fight
to
the
last
drop
of
his
blood
good
king
arthur
said
rudolph
thou
art
a
dutiful
observer
of
the
fifth
commandment
and
thy
days
shall
be
long
in
the
land
do
not
suppose
us
neglectful
of
the
same
duty
although
for
the
present
we
conceive
ourselves
bound
in
the
first
place
to
attend
to
the
weal
of
our
country
the
common
parent
of
our
fathers
and
ourselves
but
as
you
know
our
profound
respect
for
the
landamman
you
need
not
fear
that
we
shall
willingly
offer
him
offence
by
rashly
engaging
in
hostilities
or
without
some
weighty
reason
and
an
attempt
to
plunder
his
guest
would
have
been
met
on
his
part
with
resistance
to
the
death
i
had
hoped
to
find
both
you
and
your
father
prompt
enough
to
resent
such
a
gross
injury
nevertheless
if
your
father
inclines
to
present
his
fleece
to
be
shorn
by
archibald
of
hagenbach
whose
scissors
he
will
find
clip
pretty
closely
it
would
be
unnecessary
and
uncivil
in
us
to
interpose
meantime
you
have
the
advantage
of
knowing
that
in
case
the
governor
of
la
ferette
should
be
disposed
to
strip
you
of
skin
as
well
as
fleece
there
are
more
men
close
at
hand
than
you
looked
for
whom
you
will
find
both
able
and
willing
to
render
you
prompt
assistance
on
these
terms
said
the
englishman
i
make
my
acknowledgments
to
these
gentlemen
of
bâle
or
whatever
other
country
hath
sent
them
forth
and
pledge
them
in
a
brotherly
cup
to
our
further
and
more
intimate
acquaintance
health
and
prosperity
to
the
united
cantons
and
their
friends
answered
the
blue
cavalier
and
death
and
confusion
to
all
besides
the
cups
were
replenished
and
instead
of
a
shout
of
applause
the
young
men
around
testified
their
devoted
determination
to
the
cause
which
was
thus
announced
by
grasping
each
other
hands
and
then
brandishing
their
weapons
with
a
fierce
yet
noiseless
gesture
thus
said
rudolph
donnerhugel
our
illustrious
ancestors
the
fathers
of
swiss
independence
met
in
the
immortal
field
of
rutli
between
uri
and
unterwalden
thus
they
swore
to
each
other
under
the
blue
firmament
of
heaven
that
they
would
restore
the
liberty
of
their
oppressed
country
and
history
can
tell
how
well
they
kept
their
word
and
she
shall
record
said
the
blue
cavalier
how
well
the
present
switzers
can
preserve
the
freedom
which
their
fathers
proceed
in
your
rounds
good
rudolph
and
be
assured
that
at
the
signal
of
the
hauptman
the
soldiers
will
not
be
far
absent
all
is
arranged
as
formerly
unless
you
have
new
orders
to
give
us
hark
thee
hither
lawrenz
said
rudolph
to
the
blue
cavalier
and
arthur
could
hear
him
say
beware
my
friend
that
the
rhine
wine
be
not
abused
if
there
is
too
much
provision
of
it
manage
to
destroy
the
flasks
a
mule
may
stumble
thou
knowest
or
so
give
not
way
to
rudiger
in
this
he
is
grown
a
since
he
joined
us
we
must
bring
both
heart
and
hand
to
what
may
be
done
they
then
whispered
so
low
that
arthur
could
hear
nothing
of
their
further
conference
and
bid
each
other
adieu
after
clasping
hands
as
if
they
were
renewing
some
solemn
pledge
of
union
rudolph
and
his
party
then
moved
forward
and
were
scarce
out
of
sight
of
their
new
associates
when
the
vidette
or
foremost
of
their
patrol
gave
the
signal
of
alarm
arthur
heart
leaped
to
his
lips
it
is
anne
of
geierstein
he
said
internally
the
dogs
are
silent
said
the
bernese
those
who
approach
must
be
the
companions
of
our
watch
they
proved
accordingly
to
be
rudiger
and
his
party
who
halting
on
the
appearance
of
their
comrades
made
and
underwent
a
formal
challenge
such
advance
had
the
swiss
already
made
in
military
discipline
which
was
but
little
and
rudely
studied
by
the
infantry
in
other
parts
of
europe
arthur
could
hear
rudolph
take
his
friend
rudiger
to
task
for
not
meeting
him
at
the
appointed
it
leads
to
new
revelry
on
your
arrival
he
said
and
must
find
us
cool
and
determined
cool
as
an
icicle
noble
hauptman
answered
the
son
of
the
landamman
and
determined
as
the
rock
it
hangs
upon
rudolph
again
recommended
temperance
and
the
young
biederman
promised
compliance
the
two
parties
passed
each
other
with
friendly
though
silent
greeting
and
there
was
soon
a
considerable
distance
between
them
the
country
was
more
open
on
the
side
of
the
castle
around
which
their
duty
now
led
them
than
where
it
lay
opposite
to
the
principal
gate
the
glades
were
broad
the
trees
thinly
scattered
over
pasture
land
and
there
were
no
thickets
ravines
or
similar
places
of
ambush
so
that
the
eye
might
in
the
clear
moonlight
well
command
the
country
here
said
rudolph
we
may
judge
ourselves
secure
enough
for
some
conference
and
therefore
may
i
ask
thee
arthur
of
england
now
thou
hast
seen
us
more
closely
what
thinkest
thou
of
the
switzer
youth
if
thou
hast
learned
less
than
i
could
have
wished
thank
thine
own
uncommunicative
temper
which
retired
in
some
degree
from
our
confidence
only
in
so
far
as
i
could
not
have
answered
and
therefore
ought
not
to
have
received
it
said
arthur
the
judgment
i
have
been
enabled
to
form
amounts
in
few
words
to
this
your
purposes
are
lofty
and
noble
as
your
mountains
but
the
stranger
from
the
low
country
is
not
accustomed
to
tread
the
circuitous
path
by
which
you
ascend
them
my
foot
has
been
always
accustomed
to
move
straight
forward
upon
the
greensward
you
speak
in
riddles
answered
the
bernese
not
so
returned
the
englishman
i
think
you
ought
plainly
to
mention
to
your
seniors
the
nominal
leaders
of
young
men
who
seem
well
disposed
to
take
their
own
road
that
you
expect
an
attack
in
the
neighbourhood
of
la
ferette
and
hope
for
assistance
from
some
of
the
townsmen
of
bâle
ay
truly
answered
donnerhugel
and
the
landamman
would
stop
his
journey
till
he
despatched
a
messenger
for
a
to
the
duke
of
burgundy
and
should
he
grant
it
there
were
an
end
of
all
hope
of
war
true
replied
arthur
but
the
landamman
would
thereby
obtain
his
own
principal
object
and
the
sole
purpose
of
the
mission
that
is
the
establishment
of
peace
peace
peace
answered
the
bernese
hastily
were
my
wishes
alone
to
be
opposed
to
those
of
arnold
biederman
i
know
so
much
of
his
honour
and
faith
i
respect
so
highly
his
valour
and
patriotism
that
at
his
voice
i
would
sheathe
my
sword
even
if
my
most
mortal
enemy
stood
before
me
but
mine
is
not
the
single
wish
of
a
single
man
the
whole
of
my
canton
and
that
of
soleure
are
determined
on
war
it
was
by
war
noble
war
that
our
fathers
came
forth
from
the
house
of
their
captivity
it
was
by
war
successful
and
glorious
war
that
a
race
who
had
been
held
scarce
so
much
worth
thinking
on
as
the
oxen
which
they
goaded
emerged
at
once
into
liberty
and
consequence
and
were
honoured
because
they
were
feared
as
much
as
they
had
been
formerly
despised
because
they
were
unresisting
this
may
be
all
very
true
said
the
young
englishman
but
in
my
opinion
the
object
of
your
mission
has
been
determined
by
your
diet
or
house
of
commons
they
have
resolved
to
send
you
with
others
as
messengers
of
peace
but
you
are
secretly
blowing
the
coals
of
war
and
while
all
or
most
of
your
senior
colleagues
are
setting
out
in
expectation
of
a
peaceful
journey
you
stand
prepared
for
a
combat
and
look
for
the
means
of
giving
cause
for
it
and
is
it
not
well
that
i
do
stand
so
prepared
answered
rudolph
if
our
reception
in
burgundy
dependencies
be
peaceful
as
you
say
the
rest
of
the
deputation
expect
my
precautions
will
be
needless
but
at
least
they
can
do
no
harm
if
it
prove
otherwise
i
shall
be
the
means
of
averting
a
great
misfortune
from
my
colleagues
my
kinsman
arnold
biederman
my
fair
cousin
anne
your
father
yourself
from
all
of
us
in
short
who
are
joyously
travelling
together
arthur
shook
his
head
there
is
something
in
all
this
he
said
which
i
understand
not
and
will
not
seek
to
understand
i
only
pray
that
you
will
not
make
my
father
concerns
the
subject
of
breaking
truce
it
may
as
you
hint
involve
the
landamman
in
a
quarrel
which
he
might
otherwise
have
avoided
i
am
sure
my
father
will
never
forgive
it
i
have
pledged
my
word
said
rudolph
already
to
that
effect
but
if
he
should
like
the
usage
of
the
bandog
of
burgundy
less
than
you
seem
to
apprehend
he
will
there
is
no
harm
in
your
knowing
that
in
time
of
need
he
may
be
well
and
actively
supported
i
am
greatly
obliged
by
the
assurance
replied
the
englishman
and
thou
mayst
thyself
my
friend
continued
rudolph
take
a
warning
from
what
thou
hast
heard
men
go
not
to
a
bridal
in
armour
nor
to
a
brawl
in
silken
doublet
i
will
be
clad
to
meet
the
worst
said
arthur
and
for
that
purpose
i
will
don
a
light
hauberk
of
steel
proof
against
spear
or
arrow
and
i
thank
you
for
your
kindly
counsel
nay
thank
not
me
said
rudolph
i
were
ill
deserving
to
be
a
leader
did
i
not
make
those
who
are
to
follow
me
more
especially
so
trusty
a
follower
as
thou
art
aware
of
the
time
when
they
should
buckle
on
their
armour
and
prepare
for
hard
blows
here
the
conversation
paused
for
a
moment
or
two
neither
of
the
speakers
being
entirely
contented
with
his
companion
although
neither
pressed
any
further
remark
the
bernese
judging
from
the
feelings
which
he
had
seen
predominate
among
the
traders
of
his
own
country
had
entertained
little
doubt
that
the
englishman
finding
himself
powerfully
supported
in
point
of
force
would
have
caught
at
the
opportunity
to
resist
paying
the
exorbitant
imposts
with
which
he
was
threatened
at
the
next
town
which
would
probably
without
any
effort
on
rudolph
part
have
led
to
breaking
off
the
truce
on
the
part
of
arnold
biederman
himself
and
to
an
instant
declaration
of
hostilities
on
the
other
hand
young
philipson
could
not
understand
or
approve
of
donnerhugel
conduct
who
himself
a
member
of
a
peaceful
deputation
seemed
to
be
animated
with
the
purpose
of
seizing
an
opportunity
to
kindle
the
flames
of
war
occupied
by
these
various
reflections
they
walked
side
by
side
for
some
time
without
speaking
together
until
rudolph
broke
silence
your
curiosity
is
then
ended
sir
englishman
said
he
respecting
the
apparition
of
anne
of
geierstein
far
from
it
replied
philipson
but
i
would
unwillingly
intrude
any
questions
on
you
while
you
are
busy
with
the
duties
of
your
patrol
that
may
be
considered
as
over
said
the
bernese
for
there
is
not
a
bush
near
us
to
cover
a
burgundian
knave
and
a
glance
around
us
from
time
to
time
is
all
that
is
now
needful
to
prevent
surprise
and
so
listen
while
i
tell
a
tale
never
sung
or
harped
in
hall
or
bower
and
which
i
begin
to
think
deserves
as
much
credit
at
least
as
is
due
to
the
tales
of
the
round
table
which
ancient
troubadours
and
dole
out
to
us
as
the
authentic
chronicles
of
your
renowned
namesake
of
anne
ancestors
on
the
male
side
of
the
house
continued
rudolph
i
dare
say
you
have
heard
enough
and
are
well
aware
how
they
dwelt
in
the
old
walls
at
geierstein
beside
the
cascade
grinding
their
vassals
devouring
the
substance
of
their
less
powerful
neighbours
and
plundering
the
goods
of
the
travellers
whom
ill
luck
sent
within
ken
of
the
vulture
eyry
the
one
year
and
in
the
next
wearying
the
shrines
for
mercy
for
their
trespasses
overwhelming
the
priests
with
the
wealth
which
they
showered
upon
them
and
finally
vowing
vows
and
making
pilgrimages
sometimes
as
palmers
sometimes
as
crusaders
as
far
as
jerusalem
itself
to
atone
for
the
iniquities
which
they
had
committed
without
hesitation
or
struggle
of
conscience
such
i
have
understood
replied
the
young
englishman
was
the
history
of
the
house
of
geierstein
till
arnold
or
his
immediate
ancestors
exchanged
the
lance
for
the
but
it
is
said
replied
the
bernese
that
the
powerful
and
wealthy
barons
of
arnheim
of
swabia
whose
only
female
descendant
became
the
wife
to
count
albert
of
geierstein
and
the
mother
of
this
young
person
whom
swiss
call
simply
anne
and
germans
countess
anne
of
geierstein
were
nobles
of
a
different
caste
they
did
not
restrict
their
lives
within
the
limits
of
sinning
and
repenting
of
plundering
harmless
peasants
and
pampering
fat
monks
but
were
distinguished
for
something
more
than
building
castles
with
dungeons
and
or
and
founding
monasteries
with
galilees
and
refectories
these
same
barons
of
arnheim
were
men
who
strove
to
enlarge
the
boundaries
of
human
knowledge
and
converted
their
castle
into
a
species
of
college
where
there
were
more
ancient
volumes
than
the
monks
have
piled
together
in
the
library
of
gall
nor
were
their
studies
in
books
alone
deep
buried
in
their
private
laboratories
they
attained
secrets
which
were
afterwards
transmitted
through
the
race
from
father
to
son
and
were
supposed
to
have
approached
nearly
to
the
deepest
recesses
of
alchemy
the
report
of
their
wisdom
and
their
wealth
was
often
brought
to
the
imperial
footstool
and
in
the
frequent
disputes
which
the
emperors
maintained
with
the
popes
of
old
it
is
said
they
were
encouraged
if
not
instigated
by
the
counsels
of
the
barons
of
arnheim
and
supported
by
their
treasures
it
was
perhaps
such
a
course
of
politics
joined
to
the
unusual
and
mysterious
studies
which
the
family
of
arnheim
so
long
pursued
which
excited
against
them
the
generally
received
opinion
that
they
were
assisted
in
their
superhuman
researches
by
supernatural
influences
the
priests
were
active
in
forwarding
this
cry
against
men
who
perhaps
had
no
other
fault
than
that
of
being
wiser
than
themselves
what
guests
they
said
received
in
the
halls
of
arnheim
let
a
christian
knight
crippled
in
war
with
the
saracens
present
himself
on
the
drawbridge
he
is
guerdoned
with
a
crust
and
a
cup
of
wine
and
required
to
pass
on
his
way
if
a
palmer
redolent
of
the
sanctity
acquired
by
his
recent
visits
to
the
most
holy
shrines
and
by
the
sacred
relics
which
attest
and
reward
his
toil
approach
the
unhallowed
walls
the
warder
bends
his
crossbow
and
the
porter
shuts
the
gate
as
if
the
wandering
saint
brought
the
plague
with
him
from
palestine
but
comes
there
a
greybearded
greek
with
his
parchment
scrolls
the
very
letters
of
which
are
painful
to
christian
eyes
comes
there
a
jewish
rabbin
with
his
talmud
and
cabala
comes
there
a
swarthy
moor
who
can
boast
of
having
read
the
language
of
the
stars
in
chaldea
the
cradle
of
astrological
science
lo
the
wandering
impostor
or
sorcerer
occupies
the
highest
seat
at
the
baron
of
arnheim
board
shares
with
him
the
labours
of
the
alembic
and
the
furnace
learns
from
him
mystic
knowledge
like
that
of
which
our
first
parents
participated
to
the
overthrow
of
their
race
and
requites
it
with
lessons
more
dreadful
than
he
receives
till
the
profane
host
has
added
to
his
hoard
of
unholy
wisdom
all
that
the
pagan
visitor
can
communicate
and
these
things
are
done
in
almain
which
is
called
the
holy
roman
empire
of
which
so
many
priests
are
princes
they
are
done
and
neither
ban
nor
monition
is
issued
against
a
race
of
sorcerers
who
from
age
to
age
go
on
triumphing
in
their
necromancy
such
arguments
which
were
echoed
from
mitred
abbots
to
the
cell
of
anchorites
seem
nevertheless
to
have
made
little
impression
on
the
imperial
council
but
they
served
to
excite
the
zeal
of
many
a
baron
and
free
count
of
the
empire
who
were
taught
by
them
to
esteem
a
war
or
feud
with
the
barons
of
arnheim
as
partaking
of
the
nature
and
entitled
to
the
immunities
of
a
crusade
against
the
enemies
of
the
faith
and
to
regard
an
attack
upon
these
obnoxious
potentates
as
a
mode
of
clearing
off
their
deep
scores
with
the
christian
church
but
the
lords
of
arnheim
though
not
seeking
for
quarrel
were
by
no
means
unwarlike
or
averse
to
maintaining
their
own
defence
some
on
the
contrary
belonging
to
this
obnoxious
race
were
not
the
less
distinguished
as
gallant
knights
and
good
they
were
besides
wealthy
secured
and
strengthened
by
great
alliances
and
in
an
eminent
degree
wise
and
provident
this
the
parties
who
assailed
them
learned
to
their
cost
the
confederacies
formed
against
the
lords
of
arnheim
were
broken
up
the
attacks
which
their
enemies
meditated
were
anticipated
and
disconcerted
and
those
who
employed
actual
violence
were
repelled
with
signal
loss
to
the
assailants
until
at
length
an
impression
was
produced
in
their
neighbourhood
that
by
their
accurate
information
concerning
meditated
violence
and
their
extraordinary
powers
of
resisting
and
defeating
it
the
obnoxious
barons
must
have
brought
to
their
defence
means
which
merely
human
force
was
incapable
of
overthrowing
so
that
becoming
as
much
feared
as
hated
they
were
suffered
for
the
last
generation
to
remain
unmolested
and
this
was
the
rather
the
case
that
the
numerous
vassals
of
this
great
house
were
perfectly
satisfied
with
their
feudal
superiors
abundantly
ready
to
rise
in
their
defence
and
disposed
to
believe
that
whether
their
lords
were
sorcerers
or
no
their
own
condition
would
not
be
mended
by
exchanging
their
government
either
for
the
rule
of
the
crusaders
in
this
holy
warfare
or
that
of
the
churchmen
by
whom
it
was
instigated
the
race
of
these
barons
ended
in
herman
von
arnheim
the
maternal
grandfather
of
anne
of
geierstein
he
was
buried
with
his
helmet
sword
and
shield
as
is
the
german
custom
with
the
last
male
of
a
noble
family
but
he
left
an
only
daughter
sybilla
of
arnheim
to
inherit
a
considerable
portion
of
his
estate
and
i
never
heard
that
the
strong
imputation
of
sorcery
which
attached
to
her
house
prevented
numerous
applications
from
persons
of
the
highest
distinction
in
the
empire
to
her
legal
guardian
the
emperor
for
the
rich
heiress
hand
in
marriage
albert
of
geierstein
however
though
an
exile
obtained
the
preference
he
was
gallant
and
handsome
which
recommended
him
to
sybilla
and
the
emperor
bent
at
the
time
on
the
vain
idea
of
recovering
his
authority
in
the
swiss
mountains
was
desirous
to
show
himself
generous
to
albert
whom
he
considered
as
a
fugitive
from
his
country
for
espousing
the
imperial
cause
you
may
thus
see
most
noble
king
arthur
that
anne
of
geierstein
the
only
child
of
their
marriage
descends
from
no
ordinary
stock
and
that
circumstances
in
which
she
may
be
concerned
are
not
to
be
explained
or
judged
of
so
easily
or
upon
the
same
grounds
of
reasoning
as
in
the
case
of
ordinary
persons
by
my
honest
word
sir
rudolph
of
donnerhugel
said
arthur
studiously
labouring
to
keep
a
command
upon
his
feelings
i
can
see
nothing
in
your
narrative
and
understand
nothing
from
it
unless
it
be
that
because
in
germany
as
in
other
countries
there
have
been
fools
who
have
annexed
the
idea
of
witchcraft
and
sorcery
to
the
possession
of
knowledge
and
wisdom
you
are
therefore
disposed
to
stigmatise
a
young
maiden
who
has
always
been
respected
and
beloved
by
those
around
her
as
a
disciple
of
arts
which
i
trust
are
as
uncommon
as
unlawful
rudolph
paused
ere
he
replied
i
could
have
wished
he
said
that
you
had
been
satisfied
with
the
general
character
of
anne
of
geierstein
maternal
family
as
offering
some
circumstances
which
may
account
for
what
you
have
according
to
your
own
report
this
night
witnessed
and
i
am
really
unwilling
to
go
into
more
particular
details
to
no
one
can
anne
of
geierstein
fame
be
so
dear
as
to
me
i
am
after
her
uncle
family
her
nearest
relative
and
had
she
remained
in
switzerland
or
should
she
as
is
most
probable
return
thither
after
the
present
visit
to
her
father
perhaps
our
connection
might
be
drawn
yet
closer
this
has
indeed
only
been
prevented
by
certain
prejudices
of
her
uncle
respecting
her
father
authority
and
the
nearness
of
our
relationship
which
however
comes
within
reach
of
a
licence
very
frequently
obtained
but
i
only
mention
these
things
to
show
you
how
much
more
tender
i
must
necessarily
hold
anne
of
geierstein
reputation
than
it
is
possible
for
you
to
do
being
a
stranger
known
to
her
but
a
short
while
since
and
soon
to
part
with
her
as
i
understand
your
purpose
for
ever
the
turn
taken
in
this
kind
of
apology
irritated
arthur
so
highly
that
it
required
all
the
reasons
which
recommended
coolness
to
enable
him
to
answer
with
assumed
composure
i
can
have
no
ground
sir
hauptman
he
said
to
challenge
any
opinion
which
you
may
entertain
of
a
young
person
with
whom
you
are
so
closely
connected
as
you
appear
to
be
with
anne
of
geierstein
i
only
wonder
that
with
such
regard
for
her
as
your
relationship
implies
you
should
be
disposed
to
receive
on
popular
and
trivial
traditions
a
belief
which
must
injuriously
affect
your
kinswoman
more
especially
one
with
whom
you
intimate
a
wish
to
form
a
still
more
close
connection
bethink
you
sir
that
in
all
christian
lands
the
imputation
of
sorcery
is
the
most
foul
which
can
be
thrown
on
christian
man
or
woman
and
i
am
so
far
from
intimating
such
an
imputation
said
rudolph
somewhat
fiercely
that
by
the
good
sword
i
wear
he
that
dared
give
breath
to
such
a
thought
against
anne
of
geierstein
must
undergo
my
challenge
and
take
my
life
or
lose
his
own
but
the
question
is
not
whether
the
maiden
herself
practises
sorcery
which
he
who
avers
had
better
get
ready
his
tomb
and
provide
for
his
soul
safety
the
doubt
lies
here
whether
as
the
descendant
of
a
family
whose
relations
with
the
unseen
world
are
reported
to
have
been
of
the
closest
degree
elfish
and
fantastical
beings
may
not
have
power
to
imitate
her
form
and
to
present
her
appearance
where
she
is
not
personally
present
in
fine
whether
they
have
permission
to
play
at
her
expense
fantastical
tricks
which
they
can
not
exercise
over
other
mortals
whose
forefathers
have
ever
regulated
their
lives
by
the
rules
of
the
church
and
died
in
regular
communion
with
it
and
as
i
sincerely
desire
to
retain
your
esteem
i
have
no
objection
to
communicate
to
you
more
particular
circumstances
respecting
her
genealogy
confirming
the
idea
i
have
now
expressed
but
you
will
understand
they
are
of
the
most
private
nature
and
that
i
expect
secrecy
under
the
strictest
personal
penalty
i
shall
be
silent
sir
replied
the
young
englishman
still
struggling
with
suppressed
passion
on
everything
respecting
the
character
of
a
maiden
whom
i
am
bound
to
respect
so
highly
but
the
fear
of
no
man
displeasure
can
add
a
feather
weight
to
the
guarantee
of
my
own
honour
be
it
so
said
rudolph
it
is
not
my
wish
to
awake
angry
feelings
but
i
am
desirous
both
for
the
sake
of
your
good
opinion
which
i
value
and
also
for
the
plainer
explanation
of
what
i
have
darkly
intimated
to
communicate
to
you
what
otherwise
i
would
much
rather
have
left
untold
you
must
be
guided
by
your
own
sense
of
what
is
necessary
and
proper
in
the
case
answered
philipson
but
remember
i
press
not
on
your
confidence
for
the
communication
of
anything
that
ought
to
remain
secret
far
less
where
that
young
lady
is
the
subject
rudolph
answered
after
a
minute
pause
thou
hast
seen
and
heard
too
much
arthur
not
to
learn
the
whole
or
at
least
all
that
i
know
or
apprehend
on
the
mysterious
subject
it
is
impossible
but
the
circumstances
must
at
times
recur
to
your
recollection
and
i
am
desirous
that
you
should
possess
all
the
information
necessary
to
understand
them
as
clearly
as
the
nature
of
the
facts
will
permit
we
have
yet
keeping
leftward
to
view
the
bog
upwards
of
a
mile
to
make
ere
the
circuit
of
the
castle
is
accomplished
it
will
afford
leisure
enough
for
the
tale
i
have
to
tell
speak
on
i
listen
answered
the
englishman
divided
between
his
desire
to
know
all
that
it
was
possible
to
learn
concerning
anne
of
geierstein
and
his
dislike
to
hear
her
name
pronounced
with
such
pretensions
as
those
of
donnerhugel
together
with
the
revival
of
his
original
prejudices
against
the
gigantic
swiss
whose
manners
always
blunt
nearly
to
coarseness
seemed
now
marked
by
assumed
superiority
and
presumption
arthur
listened
however
to
his
wild
tale
and
the
interest
which
he
took
in
it
soon
overpowered
all
other
sensations
footnote
the
chivalry
of
cornwall
are
generally
undervalued
in
the
romances
the
cause
is
difficult
to
discover
chapter
xi
donnerhugel
narrative
these
be
the
adept
doctrines
every
element
is
peopled
with
its
separate
race
of
spirits
the
airy
sylphs
on
the
blue
ether
float
deep
in
the
earthy
cavern
skulks
the
gnome
the

fierce

a
friendly
home
to
its
peculiar
sprite
the
salamander
anonymous
i
told
you
said
rudolph
that
the
lords
of
arnheim
though
from
father
to
son
they
were
notoriously
addicted
to
secret
studies
were
nevertheless
like
the
other
german
nobles
followers
of
war
and
the
chase
this
was
peculiarly
the
case
with
anne
maternal
grandfather
herman
of
arnheim
who
prided
himself
on
possessing
a
splendid
stud
of
horses
and
one
steed
in
particular
the
noblest
ever
known
in
these
circles
of
germany
i
should
make
wild
work
were
i
to
attempt
a
description
of
such
an
animal
so
i
will
content
myself
with
saying
his
colour
was
jet
black
without
a
hair
of
white
either
on
his
face
or
feet
for
this
reason
and
the
wildness
of
his
disposition
his
master
had
termed
him
apollyon
a
circumstance
which
was
secretly
considered
as
tending
to
sanction
the
evil
reports
which
touched
the
house
of
arnheim
being
it
was
said
the
naming
of
a
favourite
animal
after
a
foul
fiend
it
chanced
one
november
day
that
the
baron
had
been
hunting
in
the
forest
and
did
not
reach
home
till
nightfall
there
were
no
guests
with
him
for
as
i
hinted
to
you
before
the
castle
of
arnheim
seldom
received
any
other
than
those
from
whom
its
inhabitants
hoped
to
gain
augmentation
of
knowledge
the
baron
was
seated
alone
in
his
hall
illuminated
with
cressets
and
torches
his
one
hand
held
a
volume
covered
with
characters
unintelligible
to
all
save
himself
the
other
rested
on
the
marble
table
on
which
was
placed
a
flask
of
tokay
wine
a
page
stood
in
respectful
attendance
near
the
bottom
of
the
large
and
dim
apartment
and
no
sound
was
heard
save
that
of
the
night
wind
when
it
sighed
mournfully
through
the
rusty
coats
of
mail
and
waved
the
tattered
banners
which
were
the
tapestry
of
the
feudal
hall
at
once
the
footstep
of
a
person
was
heard
ascending
the
stairs
in
haste
and
trepidation
the
door
of
the
hall
was
thrown
violently
open
and
terrified
to
a
degree
of
ecstasy
caspar
the
head
of
the
stable
or
his
master
of
horse
stumbled
up
almost
to
the
foot
of
the
table
at
which
his
lord
was
seated
with
the
exclamation
in
his
mouth
my
lord
my
lord
a
fiend
is
in
the
stable
what
means
this
folly
said
the
baron
arising
surprised
and
displeased
at
an
interruption
so
unusual
let
me
endure
your
displeasure
said
caspar
if
i
speak
not
truth
apollyon
here
he
paused
speak
out
thou
frightened
fool
said
the
baron
is
my
horse
sick
or
injured
the
master
of
the
stalls
again
gasped
forth
the
word
apollyon
say
on
said
the
baron
were
apollyon
in
presence
personally
it
were
nothing
to
shake
a
brave
man
mind
the
devil
answered
the
master
of
the
horse
is
in
stall
fool
exclaimed
the
nobleman
snatching
a
torch
from
the
wall
what
is
it
that
could
have
turned
thy
brain
in
such
silly
fashion
things
like
thee
that
are
born
to
serve
us
should
hold
their
brains
on
a
firmer
tenure
for
our
sakes
if
not
for
that
of
their
worthless
selves
as
he
spoke
he
descended
to
the
court
of
the
castle
to
visit
the
stately
range
of
stables
which
occupied
all
the
lower
part
of
the
quadrangle
on
one
side
he
entered
where
fifty
gallant
steeds
stood
in
rows
on
each
side
of
the
ample
hall
at
the
side
of
each
stall
hung
the
weapons
of
offence
and
defence
of
a
as
bright
as
constant
attention
could
make
them
together
with
the
which
formed
the
trooper
under
garment
the
baron
followed
by
one
or
two
of
the
domestics
who
had
assembled
full
of
astonishment
at
the
unusual
alarm
hastened
up
to
the
head
of
the
stable
betwixt
the
rows
of
steeds
as
he
approached
the
stall
of
his
favourite
horse
which
was
the
uppermost
of
the
row
the
gallant
steed
neither
neighed
nor
shook
his
head
nor
stamped
with
his
foot
nor
gave
the
usual
signs
of
joy
at
his
lord
approach
a
faint
moaning
as
if
he
implored
assistance
was
the
only
acknowledgment
he
gave
of
the
baron
presence
sir
herman
held
up
the
torch
and
discovered
that
there
was
indeed
a
tall
dark
figure
standing
in
the
stall
resting
his
hand
on
the
horse
shoulder
who
art
thou
said
the
baron
and
what
dost
thou
here
i
seek
refuge
and
hospitality
replied
the
stranger
and
i
conjure
thee
to
grant
it
me
by
the
shoulder
of
thy
horse
and
by
the
edge
of
thy
sword
and
so
as
they
may
never
fail
thee
when
thy
need
is
at
the
utmost
thou
art
then
a
brother
of
the
sacred
fire
said
baron
herman
of
arnheim
and
i
may
not
refuse
thee
the
refuge
which
thou
requirest
of
me
after
the
ritual
of
the
persian
magi
from
whom
and
for
what
length
of
time
dost
thou
crave
my
protection
from
those
replied
the
stranger
who
shall
arrive
in
quest
of
me
before
the
morning
cock
shall
crow
and
for
the
full
space
of
a
year
and
a
day
from
this
period
i
may
not
refuse
thee
said
the
baron
consistently
with
my
oath
and
my
honour
for
a
year
and
a
day
i
will
be
thy
pledge
and
thou
shalt
share
with
me
roof
and
chamber
wine
and
food
but
thou
too
must
obey
the
law
of
zoroaster
which
as
it
says
let
the
stronger
protect
the
weaker
brother
says
also
let
the
wiser
instruct
the
brother
who
hath
less
knowledge
i
am
the
stronger
and
thou
shalt
be
safe
under
my
protection
but
thou
art
the
wiser
and
must
instruct
me
in
the
more
secret
mysteries
you
mock
your
servant
said
the
strange
visitor
but
if
aught
is
known
to
dannischemend
which
can
avail
herman
his
instructions
shall
be
as
those
of
a
father
to
a
son
come
forth
then
from
thy
place
of
refuge
said
the
baron
of
arnheim
i
swear
to
thee
by
the
sacred
fire
which
lives
without
terrestrial
fuel
and
by
the
fraternity
which
is
betwixt
us
and
by
the
shoulder
of
my
horse
and
the
edge
of
my
good
sword
i
will
be
thy
warrand
for
a
year
and
a
day
if
so
far
my
power
shall
extend
illustration
in
the
stable
drawn
and
etched
by
de
los
rios
the
stranger
came
forth
accordingly
and
those
who
saw
the
singularity
of
his
appearance
scarce
wondered
at
the
fears
of
caspar
the
when
he
found
such
a
person
in
the
stable
by
what
mode
of
entrance
he
was
unable
to
conceive
when
he
reached
the
lighted
hall
to
which
the
baron
conducted
him
as
he
would
have
done
a
welcome
and
honoured
guest
the
stranger
appeared
to
be
very
tall
and
of
a
dignified
aspect
his
dress
was
asiatic
being
a
long
black
caftan
or
gown
like
that
worn
by
armenians
and
a
lofty
square
cap
covered
with
the
wool
of
astracan
lambs
every
article
of
the
dress
was
black
which
gave
relief
to
the
long
white
beard
that
flowed
down
over
his
bosom
his
gown
was
fastened
by
a
sash
of
black
silk
network
in
which
instead
of
a
poniard
or
sword
was
stuck
a
silver
case
containing
and
a
roll
of
parchment
the
only
ornament
of
his
apparel
consisted
in
a
large
ruby
of
uncommon
brilliancy
which
when
he
approached
the
light
seemed
to
glow
with
such
liveliness
as
if
the
gem
itself
had
emitted
the
rays
which
it
only
reflected
back
to
the
offer
of
refreshment
the
stranger
replied
bread
i
may
not
eat
water
shall
not
moisten
my
lips
until
the
avenger
shall
have
passed
by
the
threshold
the
baron
commanded
the
lamps
to
be
trimmed
and
fresh
torches
to
be
lighted
and
sending
his
whole
household
to
rest
remained
seated
in
the
hall
along
with
the
stranger
his
suppliant
at
the
dead
hour
of
midnight
the
gates
of
the
castle
were
shaken
as
by
a
whirlwind
and
a
voice
as
of
a
herald
was
heard
to
demand
a
herald
lawful
prisoner
dannischemend
the
son
of
hali
the
warder
then
heard
a
lower
window
of
the
hall
thrown
open
and
could
distinguish
his
master
voice
addressing
the
person
who
had
thus
summoned
the
castle
but
the
night
was
so
dark
that
he
might
not
see
the
speakers
and
the
language
which
they
used
was
either
entirely
foreign
or
so
largely
interspersed
with
strange
words
that
he
could
not
understand
a
syllable
which
they
said
scarce
five
minutes
had
elapsed
when
he
who
was
without
again
elevated
his
voice
as
before
and
said
in
german
for
a
year
and
a
day
then
i
forbear
my
forfeiture
but
coming
for
it
when
that
time
shall
elapse
i
come
for
my
right
and
will
no
longer
be
withstood
from
that
period
dannischemend
the
persian
was
a
constant
guest
at
the
castle
of
arnheim
and
indeed
never
for
any
visible
purpose
crossed
the
drawbridge
his
amusements
or
studies
seemed
centred
in
the
library
of
the
castle
and
in
the
laboratory
where
the
baron
sometimes
toiled
in
conjunction
with
him
for
many
hours
together
the
inhabitants
of
the
castle
could
find
no
fault
in
the
magus
or
persian
excepting
his
apparently
dispensing
with
the
ordinances
of
religion
since
he
neither
went
to
mass
nor
confession
nor
attended
upon
other
religious
ceremonies
the
chaplain
did
indeed
profess
himself
satisfied
with
the
state
of
the
stranger
conscience
but
it
had
been
long
suspected
that
the
worthy
ecclesiastic
held
his
easy
office
on
the
very
reasonable
condition
of
approving
the
principles
and
asserting
the
orthodoxy
of
all
guests
whom
the
baron
invited
to
share
his
hospitality
it
was
observed
that
dannischemend
was
rigid
in
paying
his
devotions
by
prostrating
himself
in
the
first
rays
of
the
rising
sun
and
that
he
constructed
a
silver
lamp
of
the
most
beautiful
proportions
which
he
placed
on
a
pedestal
representing
a
truncated
column
of
marble
having
its
base
sculptured
with
hieroglyphical
imagery
with
what
essences
he
fed
this
flame
was
unknown
to
all
unless
perhaps
to
the
baron
but
the
flame
was
more
steady
pure
and
lustrous
than
any
which
was
ever
seen
excepting
the
sun
of
heaven
itself
and
it
was
generally
believed
that
the
magian
made
it
an
object
of
worship
in
the
absence
of
that
blessed
luminary
nothing
else
was
observed
of
him
unless
that
his
morals
seemed
severe
his
gravity
extreme
his
general
mode
of
life
very
temperate
and
his
fasts
and
vigils
of
frequent
recurrence
except
on
particular
occasions
he
spoke
to
no
one
of
the
castle
but
the
baron
but
as
he
had
money
and
was
liberal
he
was
regarded
by
the
domestics
with
awe
indeed
but
without
fear
or
dislike
winter
was
succeeded
by
spring
summer
brought
her
flowers
and
autumn
her
fruits
which
ripened
and
were
fading
when
a
who
sometimes
attended
them
in
the
laboratory
to
render
manual
assistance
when
required
heard
the
persian
say
to
the
baron
of
arnheim
you
will
do
well
my
son
to
mark
my
words
for
my
lessons
to
you
are
drawing
to
an
end
and
there
is
no
power
on
earth
which
can
longer
postpone
my
fate
alas
my
master
said
the
baron
and
must
i
then
lose
the
benefit
of
your
direction
just
when
your
guiding
hand
becomes
necessary
to
place
me
on
the
very
pinnacle
of
the
temple
of
wisdom
be
not
discouraged
my
son
answered
the
sage
i
will
bequeath
the
task
of
perfecting
you
in
your
studies
to
my
daughter
who
will
come
hither
on
purpose
but
remember
if
you
value
the
permanence
of
your
family
look
not
upon
her
as
aught
else
than
a
helpmate
in
your
studies
for
if
you
forget
the
instructress
in
the
beauty
of
the
maiden
you
will
be
buried
with
your
sword
and
your
shield
as
the

of
your
house
and

will

for
such
alliances
never
come
to
a
happy
issue
of
which
my
own
is
an
but
hush
we
are
observed
the
household
of
the
castle
of
arnheim
having
but
few
things
to
interest
them
were
the
more
eager
observers
of
those
which
came
under
their
notice
and
when
the
termination
of
the
period
when
the
persian
was
to
receive
shelter
in
the
castle
began
to
approach
some
of
the
inmates
under
various
pretexts
but
which
resolved
into
very
terror
absconded
while
others
held
themselves
in
expectation
of
some
striking
and
terrible
catastrophe
none
such
however
took
place
and
on
the
expected
anniversary
long
ere
the
witching
hour
of
midnight
dannischemend
terminated
his
visit
in
the
castle
of
arnheim
by
riding
away
from
the
gate
in
the
guise
of
an
ordinary
traveller
the
baron
had
meantime
taken
leave
of
his
tutor
with
many
marks
of
regret
and
some
which
amounted
even
to
sorrow
the
sage
persian
comforted
him
by
a
long
whisper
of
which
the
last
part
only
was
heard
by
the
first
beam
of
sunshine
she
will
be
with
you
be
kind
to
her
but
not
over
kind
he
then
departed
and
was
never
again
seen
or
heard
of
in
the
vicinity
of
arnheim
the
baron
was
observed
during
all
the
day
after
the
departure
of
the
stranger
to
be
particularly
melancholy
he
remained
contrary
to
his
custom
in
the
great
hall
and
neither
visited
the
library
nor
the
laboratory
where
he
could
no
longer
enjoy
the
company
of
his
departed
instructor
at
dawn
of
the
ensuing
morning
sir
herman
summoned
his
page
and
contrary
to
his
habits
which
used
to
be
rather
careless
in
respect
of
apparel
he
dressed
himself
with
great
accuracy
and
as
he
was
in
the
prime
of
life
and
of
a
noble
figure
he
had
reason
to
be
satisfied
with
his
appearance
having
performed
his
toilet
he
waited
till
the
sun
had
just
appeared
above
the
horizon
and
taking
from
the
table
the
key
of
the
laboratory
which
the
page
believed
must
have
lain
there
all
night
he
walked
thither
followed
by
his
attendant
at
the
door
the
baron
made
a
pause
and
seemed
at
one
time
to
doubt
whether
he
should
not
send
away
the
page
at
another
to
hesitate
whether
he
should
open
the
door
as
one
might
do
who
expected
some
strange
sight
within
he
pulled
up
resolution
however
turned
the
key
threw
the
door
open
and
entered
the
page
followed
close
behind
his
master
and
was
astonished
to
the
point
of
extreme
terror
at
what
he
beheld
although
the
sight
however
extraordinary
had
in
it
nothing
save
what
was
agreeable
and
lovely
the
silver
lamp
was
extinguished
or
removed
from
its
pedestal
where
stood
in
place
of
it
a
most
beautiful
female
figure
in
the
persian
costume
in
which
the
colour
of
pink
predominated
but
she
wore
no
turban
or
headdress
of
any
kind
saving
a
blue
riband
drawn
through
her
auburn
hair
and
secured
by
a
gold
clasp
the
outer
side
of
which
was
ornamented
by
a
superb
opal
which
amid
the
changing
lights
peculiar
to
that
gem
displayed
internally
a
slight
tinge
of
red
like
a
spark
of
fire
the
figure
of
this
young
person
was
rather
under
the
middle
size
but
perfectly
well
formed
the
eastern
dress
with
the
wide
trousers
gathered
round
the
ankles
made
visible
the
smallest
and
most
beautiful
feet
which
had
ever
been
seen
while
hands
and
arms
of
the
most
perfect
symmetry
were
partly
seen
from
under
the
folds
of
the
robe
the
little
lady
countenance
was
of
a
lively
and
expressive
character
in
which
spirit
and
wit
seemed
to
predominate
and
the
quick
dark
eye
with
its
beautifully
formed
eyebrow
seemed
to
presage
the
arch
remark
to
which
the
rosy
and
lip
appeared
ready
to
give
utterance
the
pedestal
on
which
she
stood
or
rather
was
perched
would
have
appeared
unsafe
had
any
figure
heavier
than
her
own
been
placed
there
but
however
she
had
been
transported
thither
she
seemed
to
rest
on
it
as
lightly
and
safely
as
a
linnet
when
it
has
dropped
from
the
sky
on
the
tendril
of
a
the
first
beam
of
the
rising
sun
falling
through
a
window
directly
opposite
to
the
pedestal
increased
the
effect
of
this
beautiful
figure
which
remained
as
motionless
as
if
it
had
been
carved
in
marble
she
only
expressed
her
sense
of
the
baron
of
arnheim
presence
by
something
of
a
quicker
respiration
and
a
deep
blush
accompanied
by
a
slight
smile
whatever
reason
the
baron
of
arnheim
might
have
for
expecting
to
see
some
such
object
as
now
exhibited
its
actual
presence
the
degree
of
beauty
which
it
presented
was
so
much
beyond
his
expectation
that
for
an
instant
he
stood
without
breath
or
motion
at
once
however
he
seemed
to
recollect
that
it
was
his
duty
to
welcome
the
fair
stranger
to
his
castle
and
to
relieve
her
from
her
precarious
situation
he
stepped
forward
accordingly
with
the
words
of
welcome
on
his
tongue
and
was
extending
his
arms
to
lift
her
from
the
pedestal
which
was
nearly
six
feet
high
but
the
light
and
active
stranger
merely
accepted
the
support
of
his
hand
and
descended
on
the
floor
as
light
and
as
safe
as
if
she
had
been
formed
of
gossamer
it
was
indeed
only
by
the
momentary
pressure
of
her
little
hand
that
the
baron
of
arnheim
was
finally
made
sensible
that
he
had
to
do
with
a
being
of
flesh
and
blood
i
am
come
as
i
have
been
commanded
she
said
looking
around
her
you
must
expect
a
strict
and
diligent
mistress
and
i
hope
for
the
credit
of
an
attentive
pupil
after
the
arrival
of
this
singular
and
interesting
being
in
the
castle
of
arnheim
various
alterations
took
place
within
the
interior
of
the
household
a
lady
of
high
rank
and
small
fortune
the
respectable
widow
of
a
count
of
the
empire
who
was
the
baron
blood
relation
received
and
accepted
an
invitation
to
preside
over
her
domestic
affairs
and
remove
by
her
countenance
any
suspicions
which
might
arise
from
the
presence
of
hermione
as
the
beautiful
persian
was
generally
called
the
countess
waldstetten
carried
her
complaisance
so
far
as
to
be
present
on
almost
all
occasions
whether
in
the
laboratory
or
library
when
the
baron
of
arnheim
received
lessons
from
or
pursued
studies
with
the
young
and
lovely
tutor
who
had
been
thus
strangely
substituted
for
the
aged
magus
if
this
lady
report
was
to
be
trusted
their
pursuits
were
of
a
most
extraordinary
nature
and
the
results
which
she
sometimes
witnessed
were
such
as
to
create
fear
as
well
as
surprise
but
she
strongly
vindicated
them
from
practising
unlawful
arts
or
overstepping
the
boundaries
of
natural
science
a
better
judge
of
such
matters
the
bishop
of
bamberg
himself
made
a
visit
to
arnheim
on
purpose
to
witness
the
wisdom
of
which
so
much
was
reported
through
the
whole
he
conversed
with
hermione
and
found
her
deeply
impressed
with
the
truths
of
religion
and
so
perfectly
acquainted
with
its
doctrines
that
he
compared
her
to
a
doctor
of
theology
in
the
dress
of
an
eastern
when
asked
regarding
her
knowledge
of
languages
and
science
he
answered
that
he
had
been
attracted
to
arnheim
by
the
most
extravagant
reports
on
these
points
but
that
he
must
return
confessing
the
half
thereof
had
not
been
told
unto
him
in
consequence
of
this
indisputable
testimony
the
sinister
reports
which
had
been
occasioned
by
the
singular
appearance
of
the
fair
stranger
were
in
a
great
measure
lulled
to
sleep
especially
as
her
amiable
manners
won
the
involuntary
of
every
one
that
approached
her
meantime
a
marked
alteration
began
to
take
place
in
the
interviews
between
the
lovely
tutor
and
her
pupil
these
were
conducted
with
the
same
caution
as
before
and
never
so
far
as
could
be
observed
took
place
without
the
presence
of
the
countess
of
waldstetten
or
some
other
third
person
of
respectability
but
the
scenes
of
these
meetings
were
no
longer
the
scholar
library
or
the
chemist
laboratory
the
gardens
the
groves
were
resorted
to
for
amusement
and
parties
of
hunting
and
fishing
with
evenings
spent
in
the
dance
seemed
to
announce
that
the
studies
of
wisdom
were
for
a
time
abandoned
for
the
pursuits
of
pleasure
it
was
not
difficult
to
guess
the
meaning
of
this
the
baron
of
arnheim
and
his
fair
guest
speaking
a
language
different
from
all
others
could
enjoy
their
private
conversation
even
amid
all
the
tumult
of
gaiety
around
them
and
no
one
was
surprised
to
hear
it
formally
announced
after
a
few
weeks
of
gaiety
that
the
fair
persian
was
to
be
wedded
to
the
baron
of
arnheim
the
manners
of
this
fascinating
young
person
were
so
pleasing
her
conversation
so
animated
her
wit
so
keen
yet
so
well
tempered
with
good
nature
and
modesty
that
notwithstanding
her
unknown
origin
her
high
fortune
attracted
less
envy
than
might
have
been
expected
in
a
case
so
singular
above
all
her
generosity
amazed
and
won
the
hearts
of
all
the
young
persons
who
approached
her
her
wealth
seemed
to
be
measureless
for
the
many
rich
jewels
which
she
distributed
among
her
fair
friends
would
otherwise
have
left
her
without
ornaments
for
herself
these
good
qualities
her
liberality
above
all
together
with
a
simplicity
of
thought
and
character
which
formed
a
beautiful
contrast
to
the
depth
of
acquired
knowledge
which
she
was
well
known
to
possess
these
and
her
total
want
of
ostentation
made
her
superiority
be
pardoned
among
her
companions
still
there
was
notice
taken
of
some
peculiarities
exaggerated
perhaps
by
envy
which
seemed
to
draw
a
mystical
distinction
between
the
beautiful
hermione
and
the
mere
mortals
with
whom
she
lived
and
conversed
in
the
merry
dance
she
was
so
unrivalled
in
lightness
and
agility
that
her
performance
seemed
that
of
an
aërial
being
she
could
without
suffering
from
her
exertion
continue
the
pleasure
till
she
had
tired
out
the
most
active
revellers
and
even
the
young
duke
of
hochspringen
who
was
reckoned
the
most
indefatigable
at
that
exercise
in
germany
having
been
her
partner
for
half
an
hour
was
compelled
to
break
off
the
dance
and
throw
himself
totally
exhausted
on
a
couch
exclaiming
he
had
been
dancing
not
with
a
woman
but
with
an
other
whispers
averred
that
while
she
played
with
her
young
companions
in
the
labyrinth
and
mazes
of
the
castle
gardens
at
or
similar
games
of
activity
she
became
animated
with
the
same
supernatural
alertness
which
was
supposed
to
inspire
her
in
the
dance
she
appeared
amongst
her
companions
and
vanished
from
them
with
a
degree
of
rapidity
which
was
inconceivable
and
hedges
treillage
or
such
like
obstructions
were
surmounted
by
her
in
a
manner
which
the
most
vigilant
eye
could
not
detect
for
after
being
observed
on
the
side
of
the
barrier
at
one
instant
in
another
she
was
beheld
close
beside
the
spectator
in
such
moments
when
her
eyes
sparkled
her
cheeks
reddened
and
her
whole
frame
became
animated
it
was
pretended
that
the
opal
clasp
amid
her
tresses
the
ornament
which
she
never
laid
aside
shot
forth
the
little
spark
or
tongue
of
flame
which
it
always
displayed
with
an
increased
vivacity
in
the
same
manner
if
in
the
hall
the
conversation
of
hermione
became
unusually
animated
it
was
believed
that
the
jewel
became
brilliant
and
even
displayed
a
twinkling
and
flashing
gleam
which
seemed
to
be
emitted
by
the
gem
itself
and
not
produced
in
the
usual
manner
by
the
reflection
of
some
external
light
her
maidens
were
also
heard
to
surmise
that
when
their
mistress
was
agitated
by
any
hasty
or
brief
resentment
the
only
weakness
of
temper
which
she
was
sometimes
observed
to
display
they
could
observe
sparks
flash
from
the
mystic
brooch
as
if
it
sympathised
with
the
wearer
emotions
the
women
who
attended
on
her
toilet
further
reported
that
this
gem
was
never
removed
but
for
a
few
minutes
when
the
baroness
hair
was
combed
out
that
she
was
unusually
pensive
and
silent
during
the
time
it
was
laid
aside
and
particularly
apprehensive
when
any
liquid
was
brought
near
it
even
in
the
use
of
holy
water
at
the
door
of
the
church
she
was
observed
to
omit
the
sign
of
the
cross
on
the
forehead
for
fear
it
was
supposed
of
the
water
touching
the
valued
jewel
these
singular
reports
did
not
prevent
the
marriage
of
the
baron
of
arnheim
from
proceeding
as
had
been
arranged
it
was
celebrated
in
the
usual
form
and
with
the
utmost
splendour
and
the
young
couple
seemed
to
commence
a
life
of
happiness
rarely
to
be
found
on
earth
in
the
course
of
twelve
months
the
lovely
baroness
presented
her
husband
with
a
daughter
which
was
to
be
christened
sybilla
after
the
mother
as
the
health
of
the
child
was
excellent
the
ceremony
was
postponed
till
the
recovery
of
the
mother
from
her
confinement
many
were
invited
to
be
present
on
the
occasion
and
the
castle
was
thronged
with
company
it
happened
that
amongst
the
guests
was
an
old
lady
notorious
for
playing
in
private
society
the
part
of
a
malicious
fairy
in
a
minstrel
tale
this
was
the
baroness
of
steinfeldt
famous
in
the
neighbourhood
for
her
insatiable
curiosity
and
overweening
pride
she
had
not
been
many
days
in
the
castle
ere
by
the
aid
of
a
female
attendant
who
acted
as
an
intelligencer
she
had
made
herself
mistress
of
all
that
was
heard
said
or
suspected
concerning
the
peculiarities
of
the
baroness
hermione
it
was
on
the
morning
of
the
day
appointed
for
the
christening
while
the
whole
company
were
assembled
in
the
hall
and
waiting
till
the
baroness
should
appear
to
pass
with
them
to
the
chapel
that
there
arose
between
the
censorious
and
haughty
dame
whom
we
have
just
mentioned
and
the
countess
waldstetten
a
violent
discussion
concerning
some
point
of
disputed
precedence
it
was
referred
to
the
baron
von
arnheim
who
decided
in
favour
of
the
countess
madame
de
steinfeldt
instantly
ordered
her
palfrey
to
be
prepared
and
her
attendants
to
mount
i
leave
this
place
she
said
which
a
good
christian
ought
never
to
have
entered
i
leave
a
house
of
which
the
master
is
a
sorcerer
the
mistress
a
demon
who
dares
not
cross
her
brow
with
holy
water
and
their
trencher
companion
one
who
for
a
wretched
pittance
is
willing
to
act
as
between
a
wizard
and
an
incarnate
fiend
she
then
departed
with
rage
in
her
countenance
and
spite
in
her
heart
the
baron
of
arnheim
then
stepped
forward
and
demanded
of
the
knights
and
gentlemen
around
if
there
were
any
among
them
who
would
dare
to
make
good
with
his
sword
the
infamous
falsehoods
thrown
upon
himself
his
spouse
and
his
kinswoman
there
was
a
general
answer
utterly
refusing
to
defend
the
baroness
of
steinfeldt
words
in
so
bad
a
cause
and
universally
testifying
the
belief
of
the
company
that
she
spoke
in
the
spirit
of
calumny
and
falsehood
then
let
that
lie
fall
to
the
ground
which
no
man
of
courage
will
hold
up
said
the
baron
of
arnheim
only
all
who
are
here
this
morning
shall
be
satisfied
whether
the
baroness
hermione
doth
or
doth
not
share
the
rites
of
christianity
the
countess
of
waldstetten
made
anxious
signs
to
him
while
he
spoke
thus
and
when
the
crowd
permitted
her
to
approach
near
him
she
was
heard
to
whisper
oh
be
not
rash
try
no
experiment
there
is
something
mysterious
about
that
opal
talisman
be
prudent
and
let
the
matter
pass
by
the
baron
who
was
in
a
more
towering
passion
than
well
became
the
wisdom
to
which
he
made
pretence
although
it
will
be
perhaps
allowed
that
an
affront
so
public
and
in
such
a
time
and
place
was
enough
to
shake
the
prudence
of
the
most
staid
and
the
philosophy
of
the
most
wise
answered
sternly
and
briefly
are
you
too
such
a
fool
and
retained
his
purpose
the
baroness
of
arnheim
at
this
moment
entered
the
hall
looking
just
so
pale
from
her
late
confinement
as
to
render
her
lovely
countenance
more
interesting
if
less
animated
than
usual
having
paid
her
compliments
to
the
assembled
company
with
the
most
graceful
and
condescending
attention
she
was
beginning
to
inquire
why
madame
de
steinfeldt
was
not
present
when
her
husband
made
the
signal
for
the
company
to
move
forward
to
the
chapel
and
lent
the
baroness
his
arm
to
bring
up
the
rear
the
chapel
was
nearly
filled
by
the
splendid
company
and
all
eyes
were
bent
on
their
host
and
hostess
as
they
entered
the
place
of
devotion
immediately
after
four
young
ladies
who
supported
the
infant
babe
in
a
light
and
beautiful
litter
as
they
passed
the
threshold
the
baron
dipped
his
finger
in
the
and
offered
holy
water
to
his
lady
who
accepted
it
as
usual
by
touching
his
finger
with
her
own
but
then
as
if
to
confute
the
calumnies
of
the
malevolent
lady
of
steinfeldt
with
an
air
of
sportive
familiarity
which
was
rather
unwarranted
by
the
time
and
place
he
flirted
on
her
beautiful
forehead
a
drop
or
two
of
the
moisture
which
remained
on
his
own
hand
the
opal
on
which
one
of
these
drops
had
lighted
shot
out
a
brilliant
spark
like
a
falling
star
and
became
the
instant
afterwards
lightless
and
colourless
as
a
common
pebble
while
the
beautiful
baroness
sank
on
the
floor
of
the
chapel
with
a
deep
sigh
of
pain
all
crowded
around
her
in
dismay
the
unfortunate
hermione
was
raised
from
the
ground
and
conveyed
to
her
chamber
and
so
much
did
her
countenance
and
pulse
alter
within
the
short
time
necessary
to
do
this
that
those
who
looked
upon
her
pronounced
her
a
dying
woman
she
was
no
sooner
in
her
own
apartment
than
she
requested
to
be
left
alone
with
her
husband
he
remained
an
hour
in
the
room
and
when
he
came
out
he
locked
and
double
locked
the
door
behind
him
he
then
betook
himself
to
the
chapel
and
remained
there
for
an
hour
or
more
prostrated
before
the
altar
in
the
meantime
most
of
the
guests
had
dispersed
in
dismay
though
some
abode
out
of
courtesy
or
curiosity
there
was
a
general
sense
of
impropriety
in
suffering
the
door
of
the
sick
lady
apartment
to
remain
locked
but
alarmed
at
the
whole
circumstances
of
her
illness
it
was
some
time
ere
any
one
dared
disturb
the
devotions
of
the
baron
at
length
medical
aid
arrived
and
the
countess
of
waldstetten
took
upon
her
to
demand
the
key
she
spoke
more
than
once
to
a
man
who
seemed
incapable
of
hearing
at
least
of
understanding
what
she
said
at
length
he
gave
her
the
key
and
added
sternly
as
he
did
so
that
all
aid
was
unavailing
and
that
it
was
his
pleasure
that
all
strangers
should
leave
the
castle
there
were
few
who
inclined
to
stay
when
upon
opening
the
door
of
the
chamber
in
which
the
baroness
had
been
deposited
little
more
than
two
hours
before
no
traces
of
her
could
be
discovered
unless
that
there
was
about
a
handful
of
ashes
like
such
as
might
have
been
produced
by
burning
fine
paper
found
on
the
bed
where
she
had
been
laid
a
solemn
funeral
was
nevertheless
performed
with
masses
and
all
other
spiritual
rites
for
the
soul
of
the
high
and
noble
lady
hermione
of
arnheim
and
it
was
exactly
on
that
same
day
three
years
that
the
baron
himself
was
laid
in
the
grave
of
the
same
chapel
of
arnheim
with
sword
shield
and
helmet
as
the
last
male
of
his
family
here
the
swiss
paused
for
they
were
approaching
the
bridge
of
the
castle
of
chapter
xii
believe
me
sir
it
carries
a
rare
but
is
a
spirit
there
was
a
short
silence
after
the
bernese
had
concluded
his
singular
tale
arthur
philipson
attention
had
been
gradually
and
intensely
attracted
by
a
story
which
was
too
much
in
unison
with
the
received
ideas
of
the
age
to
be
encountered
by
the
unhesitating
incredulity
with
which
it
must
have
been
heard
in
later
and
more
enlightened
times
he
was
also
considerably
struck
by
the
manner
in
which
it
had
been
told
by
the
narrator
whom
he
had
hitherto
only
regarded
in
the
light
of
a
rude
huntsman
or
soldier
whereas
he
now
allowed
donnerhugel
credit
for
a
more
extensive
acquaintance
with
the
general
manners
of
the
world
than
he
had
previously
anticipated
the
swiss
rose
in
his
opinion
as
a
man
of
talent
but
without
making
the
slightest
progress
in
his
affections
the
swashbuckler
he
said
to
himself
has
brains
as
well
as
brawn
and
bones
and
is
fitter
for
the
office
of
commanding
others
than
i
formerly
thought
him
then
turning
to
his
companion
he
thanked
him
for
the
tale
which
had
shortened
the
way
in
so
interesting
a
manner
and
it
is
from
this
singular
marriage
he
continued
that
anne
of
geierstein
derives
her
origin
her
mother
answered
the
swiss
was
sybilla
of
arnheim
the
infant
at
whose
christening
the
mother
died
disappeared
or
whatever
you
may
list
to
call
it
the
barony
of
arnheim
being
a
male
fief
reverted
to
the
emperor
the
castle
has
never
been
inhabited
since
the
death
of
the
last
lord
and
has
as
i
have
heard
become
in
some
sort
ruinous
the
occupations
of
its
ancient
proprietors
and
above
all
the
catastrophe
of
its
last
inhabitant
have
been
thought
to
render
it
no
eligible
place
of
residence
did
there
appear
anything
preternatural
said
the
englishman
about
the
young
baroness
who
married
the
brother
of
the
landamman
so
far
as
i
have
heard
replied
rudolph
there
were
strange
stories
it
was
said
that
the
nurses
at
the
dead
of
night
have
seen
hermione
the
last
baroness
of
arnheim
stand
weeping
by
the
side
of
the
child
cradle
and
other
things
to
the
same
purpose
but
here
i
speak
from
less
correct
information
than
that
from
which
i
drew
my
former
narrative
and
since
the
credibility
of
a
story
not
very
probable
in
itself
must
needs
be
granted
or
withheld
according
to
the
evidence
on
which
it
is
given
may
i
ask
you
said
arthur
to
tell
me
what
is
the
authority
on
which
you
have
so
much
reliance
willingly
answered
the
swiss
know
that
theodore
donnerhugel
the
favourite
page
of
the
last
baron
of
arnheim
was
my
father
brother
upon
his
master
death
he
retired
to
his
native
town
of
berne
and
most
of
his
time
was
employed
in
training
me
up
to
arms
and
martial
exercises
as
well
according
to
the
fashion
of
germany
as
of
switzerland
for
he
was
master
of
all
he
witnessed
with
his
own
eyes
and
heard
with
his
own
ears
great
part
of
the
melancholy
and
mysterious
events
which
i
have
detailed
to
you
should
you
ever
visit
berne
you
may
see
the
good
old
man
you
think
then
said
arthur
that
the
appearance
which
i
have
this
night
seen
is
connected
with
the
mysterious
marriage
of
anne
of
geierstein
grandfather
nay
replied
rudolph
think
not
that
i
can
lay
down
any
positive
explanation
of
a
thing
so
strange
i
can
only
say
that
unless
i
did
you
the
injustice
to
disbelieve
your
testimony
respecting
the
apparition
of
this
evening
i
know
no
way
to
account
for
it
except
by
remembering
that
there
is
a
portion
of
the
young
lady
blood
which
is
thought
not
to
be
derived
from
the
race
of
adam
but
more
or
less
directly
from
one
of
those
elementary
spirits
which
have
been
talked
of
both
in
ancient
and
modern
times
but
i
may
be
mistaken
we
will
see
how
she
bears
herself
in
the
morning
and
whether
she
carries
in
her
looks
the
weariness
and
paleness
of
a
midnight
watcher
if
she
doth
not
we
may
be
authorised
in
thinking
either
that
your
eyes
have
strangely
deceived
you
or
that
they
have
been
cheated
by
some
spectral
appearance
which
is
not
of
this
world
to
this
the
young
englishman
attempted
no
reply
nor
was
there
time
for
any
for
they
were
immediately
afterwards
challenged
by
the
sentinel
from
the
drawbridge
the
question
who
goes
there
was
twice
satisfactorily
answered
before
sigismund
would
admit
the
patrol
to
cross
the
drawbridge
ass
and
mule
that
thou
art
said
rudolph
what
was
the
meaning
of
thy
delay
ass
and
mule
thyself
hauptman
said
the
swiss
in
answer
to
this
objurgation
i
have
been
surprised
by
a
goblin
on
my
post
once
already
and
i
have
got
so
much
experience
upon
that
matter
that
i
will
not
easily
be
caught
a
second
time
what
goblin
thou
fool
said
donnerhugel
would
be
idle
enough
to
play
his
gambols
at
the
expense
of
so
very
poor
an
animal
as
thou
art
thou
art
as
cross
as
my
father
hauptman
replied
sigismund
who
cries
fool
and
blockhead
at
every
word
i
speak
and
yet
i
have
lips
teeth
and
tongue
to
speak
with
just
like
other
folk
we
will
not
contest
the
matter
sigismund
said
rudolph
it
is
clear
that
if
thou
dost
differ
from
other
people
it
is
in
a
particular
which
thou
canst
hardly
be
expected
to
find
out
or
acknowledge
but
what
in
the
name
of
simplicity
is
it
which
hath
alarmed
thee
on
thy
post
marry
thus
it
was
hauptman
returned
sigismund
biederman
i
was
something
tired
you
see
with
looking
up
at
the
broad
moon
and
thinking
what
in
the
universe
it
could
be
made
of
and
how
we
came
to
see
it
just
as
well
here
as
at
home
this
place
being
so
many
miles
from
geierstein
i
was
tired
i
say
of
this
and
other
perplexing
thoughts
so
i
drew
my
fur
cap
down
over
my
ears
for
i
promise
you
the
wind
blew
shrill
and
then
i
planted
myself
firm
on
my
feet
with
one
of
my
legs
a
little
advanced
and
both
my
hands
resting
on
my
partisan
which
i
placed
upright
before
me
to
rest
upon
and
so
i
shut
mine
eyes
shut
thine
eyes
sigismund
and
thou
upon
thy
watch
exclaimed
donnerhugel
care
not
thou
for
that
answered
sigismund
i
kept
my
ears
open
and
yet
it
was
to
little
purpose
for
something
came
upon
the
bridge
with
a
step
as
stealthy
as
that
of
a
mouse
i
looked
up
with
a
start
at
the
moment
it
was
opposite
to
me
and
when
i
looked
up
whom
think
you
i
saw
some
fool
like
thyself
said
rudolph
at
the
same
time
pressing
philipson
foot
to
make
him
attend
to
the
answer
a
hint
which
was
little
necessary
since
he
waited
for
it
in
the
utmost
agitation
out
it
came
at
last
by
mark
it
was
our
own
anne
of
geierstein
it
is
impossible
replied
the
bernese
i
should
have
said
so
too
quoth
sigismund
for
i
had
peeped
into
her
bedroom
before
she
went
thither
and
it
was
so
bedizened
that
a
queen
or
a
princess
might
have
slept
in
it
and
why
should
the
wench
get
out
of
her
good
quarters
with
all
her
friends
about
her
to
guard
her
and
go
out
to
wander
in
the
forest
may
be
said
rudolph
she
only
looked
from
the
bridge
to
see
how
the
night
waned
no
said
sigismund
she
was
returning
from
the
forest
i
saw
her
when
she
reached
the
end
of
the
bridge
and
thought
of
striking
at
her
conceiving
it
to
be
the
devil
in
her
likeness
but
i
remembered
my
halberd
is
no
birch
switch
to
chastise
boys
and
girls
with
and
had
i
done
anne
any
harm
you
would
all
have
been
angry
with
me
and
to
speak
truth
i
should
have
been
ill
pleased
with
myself
for
although
she
doth
make
a
jest
of
me
now
and
then
yet
it
were
a
dull
house
ours
were
we
to
lose
anne
ass
answered
the
bernese
didst
thou
speak
to
this
form
or
goblin
as
you
call
it
indeed
i
did
not
captain
wiseacre
my
father
is
ever
angry
with
me
when
i
speak
without
thinking
and
i
could
not
at
that
particular
moment
think
on
anything
to
the
purpose
neither
was
there
time
to
think
for
she
passed
me
like
a
upon
a
whirlwind
i
marched
into
the
castle
after
her
however
calling
on
her
by
name
so
the
sleepers
were
awakened
and
men
flew
to
their
arms
and
there
was
as
much
confusion
as
if
archibald
of
hagenbach
had
been
among
us
with
sword
and
pike
and
who
should
come
out
of
her
little
bedroom
as
much
startled
and
as
much
in
a
bustle
as
any
of
us
but
anne
herself
and
as
she
protested
she
had
never
left
her
room
that
night
why
i
sigismund
biederman
was
made
to
stand
the
whole
blame
as
if
i
could
prevent
people
ghosts
from
walking
but
i
told
her
my
mind
when
i
saw
them
all
so
set
against
me
mistress
anne
quoth
i
well
known
the
kindred
you
come
of
and
after
this
fair
notice
if
you
send
any
of
your
to
me
let
them
put
iron
on
their
heads
for
i
will
give
them
the
length
and
weight
of
a
swiss
halberd
come
in
what
shape
they
list
however
they
all
cried
on
me
and
my
father
drove
me
out
again
with
as
little
remorse
as
if
i
had
been
the
old
which
had
stolen
in
from
his
watch
to
the
fireside
the
bernese
replied
with
an
air
of
coldness
approaching
to
contempt
you
have
slept
on
your
watch
sigismund
a
high
military
offence
and
you
have
dreamed
while
you
slept
you
were
in
good
luck
that
the
landamman
did
not
suspect
your
negligence
or
instead
of
being
sent
back
to
your
duty
like
a
lazy
you
might
have
been
scourged
back
like
a
faithless
one
to
your
kennel
at
geierstein
as
chanced
to
poor
ernest
for
a
less
matter
ernest
has
not
yet
gone
back
though
said
sigismund
and
i
think
he
may
pass
as
far
into
burgundy
as
we
shall
do
in
this
journey
i
pray
you
however
hauptman
to
treat
me
not
but
as
a
man
and
send
some
one
to
relieve
me
instead
of
prating
here
in
the
cold
night
air
if
there
be
anything
to
do
as
i
well
guess
there
may
a
mouthful
of
food
and
a
minute
of
sleep
will
be
but
a
fitting
preparative
and
i
have
stood
watch
here
these
two
mortal
hours
with
that
the
young
giant
yawned
portentously
as
if
to
enforce
the
reasons
of
his
appeal
a
mouthful
and
a
minute
said
rudolph
a
roasted
ox
and
a
lethargy
like
that
of
the
seven
sleepers
would
scarce
restore
you
to
the
use
of
your
refreshed
and
waking
senses
but
i
am
your
friend
sigismund
and
you
are
secure
in
my
favourable
report
you
shall
be
instantly
relieved
that
you
may
sleep
if
it
be
possible
without
disturbances
from
pass
on
young
men
addressing
the
others
who
by
this
time
had
come
up
and
go
to
your
rest
arthur
of
england
and
i
will
report
to
the
landamman
and
the
banneret
the
account
of
our
patrol
the
patrol
accordingly
entered
the
castle
and
were
soon
heard
joining
their
slumbering
companions
rudolph
donnerhugel
seized
arthur
arm
and
while
they
went
towards
the
hall
whispered
in
his
ear
these
are
strange
passages
how
think
you
we
should
report
them
to
the
deputation
that
i
must
refer
to
yourself
said
arthur
you
are
the
captain
of
our
watch
i
have
done
my
duty
in
telling
you
what
i
saw
or
thought
i
saw
it
is
for
you
to
judge
how
far
it
is
fitting
to
communicate
it
to
the
landamman
only
as
it
concerns
the
honour
of
his
family
to
his
ear
alone
i
think
it
should
be
confided
i
see
no
occasion
for
that
said
the
bernese
hastily
it
can
not
affect
or
interest
our
general
safety
but
i
may
take
occasion
hereafter
to
speak
with
anne
on
this
subject
this
latter
hint
gave
as
much
pain
to
arthur
as
the
general
proposal
of
silence
on
an
affair
so
delicate
had
afforded
him
satisfaction
but
his
uneasiness
was
of
a
kind
which
he
felt
it
necessary
to
suppress
and
he
therefore
replied
with
as
much
composure
as
he
could
assume
you
will
act
sir
hauptman
as
your
sense
of
duty
and
delicacy
shall
dictate
for
me
i
shall
be
silent
on
what
you
call
the
strange
passages
of
the
night
rendered
doubly
wonderful
by
the
report
of
sigismund
biederman
and
also
on
what
you
have
seen
and
heard
concerning
our
auxiliaries
of
berne
said
rudolph
on
that
i
shall
certainly
be
silent
said
arthur
unless
thus
far
that
i
mean
to
communicate
to
my
father
the
risk
of
his
baggage
being
liable
to
examination
and
seizure
at
la
ferette
it
is
needless
said
rudolph
i
will
answer
with
head
and
hand
for
the
safety
of
everything
belonging
to
him
i
thank
you
in
his
name
said
arthur
but
we
are
peaceful
travellers
to
whom
it
must
be
much
more
desirable
to
avoid
a
broil
than
to
give
occasion
for
one
even
when
secure
of
coming
out
of
it
triumphantly
these
are
the
sentiments
of
a
merchant
but
not
of
a
soldier
said
rudolph
in
a
cold
and
displeased
tone
but
the
matter
is
your
own
and
you
must
act
in
it
as
you
think
best
only
remember
if
you
go
to
la
ferette
without
our
assistance
you
hazard
both
goods
and
life
they
entered
as
he
spoke
the
apartment
of
their
the
companions
of
their
patrol
had
already
laid
themselves
down
amongst
their
sleeping
comrades
at
the
lower
end
of
the
room
the
landamman
and
the
bannerman
of
berne
heard
donnerhugel
make
a
report
that
his
patrol
both
before
and
after
midnight
had
been
made
in
safety
and
without
any
encounter
which
expressed
either
danger
or
suspicion
the
bernese
then
wrapped
him
in
his
cloak
and
lying
down
on
the
straw
with
that
happy
indifference
to
accommodation
and
promptitude
to
seize
the
moment
of
repose
which
is
acquired
by
a
life
of
vigilance
and
hardship
was
in
a
few
minutes
fast
asleep
arthur
remained
on
foot
but
a
little
longer
to
dart
an
earnest
look
on
the
door
of
anne
of
geierstein
apartment
and
to
reflect
on
the
wonderful
occurrences
of
the
evening
but
they
formed
a
chaotic
mystery
for
which
he
could
see
no
clue
and
the
necessity
of
holding
instant
communication
with
his
father
compelled
him
forcibly
to
turn
his
thoughts
in
that
direction
he
was
obliged
to
observe
caution
and
secrecy
in
accomplishing
his
purpose
for
this
he
laid
himself
down
beside
his
parent
whose
couch
with
the
hospitality
which
he
had
experienced
from
the
beginning
of
his
intercourse
with
the
swiss
had
been
arranged
in
what
was
thought
the
most
convenient
place
of
the
apartment
and
somewhat
apart
from
all
others
he
slept
sound
but
awoke
at
the
touch
of
his
son
who
whispered
to
him
in
english
for
the
greater
precaution
that
he
had
important
tidings
for
his
private
ear
an
attack
on
our
post
said
the
elder
philipson
must
we
take
to
our
weapons
not
now
said
arthur
and
i
pray
of
you
not
to
rise
or
make
alarm
this
matter
concerns
us
alone
tell
it
instantly
my
son
replied
his
father
you
speak
to
one
too
much
used
to
danger
to
be
startled
at
it
it
is
a
case
for
your
wisdom
to
consider
said
arthur
i
had
information
while
upon
the
patrol
that
the
governor
of
la
ferette
will
unquestionably
seize
upon
your
baggage
and
merchandise
under
pretext
of
levying
dues
claimed
by
the
duke
of
burgundy
i
have
also
been
informed
that
our
escort
of
swiss
youth
are
determined
to
resist
this
exaction
and
conceive
themselves
possessed
of
the
numbers
and
means
sufficient
to
do
so
successfully
by
george
that
must
not
be
said
the
elder
philipson
it
would
be
an
evil
requital
to
the
landamman
to
give
the
fiery
duke
a
pretext
for
that
war
which
the
excellent
old
man
is
so
anxiously
desirous
to
avoid
if
it
be
possible
any
exactions
however
unreasonable
i
will
gladly
pay
but
to
have
my
papers
seized
on
were
utter
ruin
i
partly
feared
this
and
it
made
me
unwilling
to
join
myself
to
the
landamman
party
we
must
now
break
off
from
it
this
rapacious
governor
will
not
surely
lay
hands
on
the
deputation
which
seeks
his
master
court
under
protection
of
the
law
of
nations
but
i
can
easily
see
how
he
might
make
our
presence
with
them
a
pretext
for
quarrel
which
will
equally
suit
his
own
avaricious
spirit
and
the
humour
of
these
fiery
young
men
who
are
seeking
for
matter
of
offence
this
shall
not
be
taken
for
our
sake
we
will
separate
ourselves
from
the
deputies
and
remain
behind
till
they
are
passed
on
if
this
de
hagenbach
be
not
the
most
unreasonable
of
men
i
will
find
a
way
to
content
him
so
far
as
we
are
individually
concerned
meanwhile
i
will
instantly
wake
the
landamman
he
said
and
acquaint
him
with
our
purpose
this
was
immediately
done
for
philipson
was
not
slow
in
the
execution
of
his
resolutions
in
a
minute
he
was
standing
by
the
side
of
arnold
biederman
who
raised
on
his
elbow
was
listening
to
his
communication
while
over
the
shoulder
of
the
landamman
rose
the
head
and
long
beard
of
the
deputy
from
schwitz
his
large
clear
blue
eyes
gleaming
from
beneath
a
fur
cap
bent
on
the
englishman
face
but
stealing
a
glance
aside
now
and
then
to
mark
the
impression
which
what
was
said
made
upon
his
colleague
good
friend
and
host
said
the
elder
philipson
we
have
heard
for
a
certainty
that
our
poor
merchandise
will
be
subjected
to
taxation
or
seizure
on
our
passage
through
la
ferette
and
i
would
gladly
avoid
all
cause
of
quarrel
for
your
sake
as
well
as
our
own
you
do
not
doubt
that
we
can
and
will
protect
you
replied
the
landamman
i
tell
you
englishman
that
the
guest
of
a
swiss
is
as
safe
by
his
side
as
an
eaglet
under
the
wing
of
its
dam
and
to
leave
us
because
danger
approaches
is
but
a
poor
compliment
to
our
courage
or
constancy
i
am
desirous
of
peace
but
not
the
duke
of
burgundy
himself
should
wrong
a
guest
of
mine
so
far
as
my
power
might
prevent
it
at
this
the
deputy
from
schwitz
clenched
a
fist
like
a
knuckles
and
showed
it
above
the
shoulders
of
his
friend
it
is
even
to
avoid
this
my
worthy
host
replied
philipson
that
i
intend
to
separate
from
your
friendly
company
sooner
than
i
desire
or
purposed
bethink
you
my
brave
and
worthy
host
you
are
an
ambassador
seeking
a
national
peace
i
a
trader
seeking
private
gain
war
or
quarrels
which
may
cause
war
are
alike
ruinous
to
your
purpose
and
mine
i
confess
to
you
frankly
that
i
am
willing
and
able
to
pay
a
large
ransom
and
when
you
are
departed
i
will
negotiate
for
the
amount
i
will
abide
in
the
town
of
bâle
till
i
have
made
fair
terms
with
archibald
de
hagenbach
and
even
if
he
is
the
avaricious
extortioner
you
describe
him
he
will
be
somewhat
moderate
with
me
rather
than
run
the
risk
of
losing
his
booty
entirely
by
my
turning
back
or
taking
another
route
you
speak
wisely
sir
englishman
said
the
landamman
and
i
thank
you
for
recalling
my
duty
to
my
remembrance
but
you
must
not
nevertheless
be
exposed
to
danger
so
soon
as
we
move
forward
the
country
will
be
again
open
to
the
devastations
of
the
burgundian
riders
and
who
will
sweep
the
roads
in
every
direction
the
people
of
bâle
are
unhappily
too
timorous
to
protect
you
they
would
yield
you
up
upon
the
governor
first
hint
and
for
justice
or
lenity
you
might
as
well
expect
it
in
hell
as
from
hagenbach
there
are
conjurations
it
is
said
that
can
make
hell
itself
tremble
said
philipson
and
i
have
means
to
propitiate
even
this
de
hagenbach
providing
i
can
get
to
private
speech
with
him
but
i
own
i
can
expect
nothing
from
his
wild
riders
but
to
be
put
to
death
for
the
value
of
my
cloak
if
that
be
the
case
said
the
landamman
and
if
you
must
needs
separate
from
us
for
which
i
deny
not
that
you
have
alleged
wise
and
worthy
reasons
wherefore
should
you
not
leave
two
hours
before
us
the
roads
will
be
safe
as
our
escort
is
expected
and
you
will
probably
if
you
travel
early
find
de
hagenbach
sober
and
as
capable
as
he
ever
is
of
hearing
reason
that
is
of
perceiving
his
own
interest
but
after
his
breakfast
is
washed
down
with
which
he
drinks
every
morning
before
he
hears
mass
his
fury
blinds
even
his
avarice
all
i
want
in
order
to
execute
this
scheme
said
philipson
is
the
loan
of
a
mule
to
carry
my
valise
which
is
packed
up
with
your
baggage
take
the
said
the
landamman
she
belongs
to
my
brother
here
from
schwitz
he
will
gladly
bestow
her
on
thee
if
she
were
worth
twenty
crowns
and
my
comrade
arnold
desired
me
to
do
so
said
the
old
whitebeard
i
will
accept
her
as
a
loan
with
gratitude
said
the
englishman
but
how
can
you
dispense
with
the
use
of
the
creature
you
have
only
one
left
we
can
easily
supply
our
want
from
bâle
said
the
landamman
nay
we
can
make
this
little
delay
serve
your
purpose
sir
englishman
i
named
for
our
time
of
departure
the
first
hour
after
daybreak
we
will
postpone
it
to
the
second
hour
which
will
give
us
enough
of
time
to
get
a
horse
or
mule
and
you
sir
philipson
space
to
reach
la
ferette
where
i
trust
you
will
have
achieved
your
business
with
de
hagenbach
to
your
contentment
and
will
join
company
again
with
us
as
we
travel
through
burgundy
if
our
mutual
objects
will
permit
our
travelling
together
worthy
landamman
answered
the
merchant
i
shall
esteem
myself
most
happy
in
becoming
the
partner
of
your
and
now
resume
the
repose
which
i
have
interrupted
god
bless
you
wise
and
man
said
the
landamman
rising
and
embracing
the
englishman
should
we
never
meet
again
i
will
still
remember
the
merchant
who
neglected
thoughts
of
gain
that
he
might
keep
the
path
of
wisdom
and
rectitude
i
know
not
another
who
would
not
have
risked
the
shedding
a
lake
of
blood
to
save
five
ounces
of
farewell
thou
too
gallant
young
man
thou
hast
learned
among
us
to
keep
thy
foot
firm
while
on
the
edge
of
a
helvetian
crag
but
none
can
teach
thee
so
well
as
thy
father
to
keep
an
upright
path
among
the
morasses
and
precipices
of
human
life
he
then
embraced
and
took
a
kind
farewell
of
his
friends
in
which
as
usual
he
was
imitated
by
his
friend
of
schwitz
who
swept
with
his
long
beard
the
right
and
left
cheeks
of
both
the
englishmen
and
again
made
them
heartily
welcome
to
the
use
of
his
mule
all
then
once
more
composed
themselves
to
rest
for
the
space
which
remained
before
the
appearance
of
the
autumnal
dawn

chapter
xiii
the
enmity
and
discord
which
of
late
sprung
from
the
rancorous
outrage
of
your
duke
to
merchants
our
countrymen
who
wanting
guilders
to
redeem
their
lives
have
seal
his
rigorous
statutes
with
their
bloods
excludes
all
pity
from
our
looks
of
the
dawn
had
scarce
begun
to
touch
the
distant
horizon
when
arthur
philipson
was
on
foot
to
prepare
for
his
father
departure
and
his
own
which
as
arranged
on
the
preceding
night
was
to
take
place
two
hours
before
the
landamman
and
his
attendants
proposed
to
leave
the
ruinous
castle
of
it
was
no
difficult
matter
for
him
to
separate
the
neatly
arranged
packages
which
contained
his
effects
from
the
clumsy
bundles
in
which
the
baggage
of
the
swiss
was
deposited
the
one
set
of
mails
was
made
up
with
the
neatness
of
men
accustomed
to
long
and
perilous
journeys
the
other
with
the
rude
carelessness
of
those
who
rarely
left
their
home
and
who
were
altogether
inexperienced
a
servant
of
the
landamman
assisted
arthur
in
this
task
and
in
placing
his
father
baggage
on
the
mule
belonging
to
the
bearded
deputy
from
schwitz
from
this
man
also
he
received
instructions
concerning
the
road
from
to
brisach
the
chief
citadel
of
la
ferette
which
was
too
plain
and
direct
to
render
it
likely
that
they
should
incur
any
risk
of
losing
their
way
as
had
befallen
them
when
travelling
on
the
swiss
mountains
everything
being
now
prepared
for
their
departure
the
young
englishman
awakened
his
father
and
acquainted
him
that
all
was
ready
he
then
retired
towards
the
chimney
while
his
father
according
to
his
daily
custom
repeated
the
prayer
of
julian
the
patron
of
travellers
and
adjusted
his
dress
for
the
journey
it
will
not
be
wondered
at
that
while
the
father
went
through
his
devotions
and
equipped
himself
for
travel
arthur
with
his
heart
full
of
what
he
had
seen
of
anne
of
geierstein
for
some
time
before
and
his
brain
dizzy
with
the
recollection
of
the
incidents
of
the
preceding
night
should
have
kept
his
eyes
riveted
on
the
door
of
the
at
which
he
had
last
seen
that
young
person
disappear
that
is
unless
the
pale
and
seemingly
fantastic
form
which
had
twice
crossed
him
so
strangely
should
prove
no
wandering
spirit
of
the
elements
but
the
living
substance
of
the
person
whose
appearance
it
bore
so
eager
was
his
curiosity
on
this
subject
that
he
strained
his
eyes
to
the
utmost
as
if
it
had
been
possible
for
them
to
have
penetrated
through
wood
and
walls
into
the
chamber
of
the
slumbering
maiden
in
order
to
discover
whether
her
eye
or
cheek
bore
any
mark
that
she
had
last
night
been
a
watcher
or
a
wanderer
but
that
was
the
proof
to
which
rudolph
appealed
he
said
internally
and
rudolph
alone
will
have
the
opportunity
of
remarking
the
result
who
knows
what
advantage
my
communication
may
give
him
in
his
suit
with
yonder
lovely
creature
and
what
must
she
think
of
me
save
as
one
light
of
thought
and
loose
of
tongue
to
whom
nothing
extraordinary
can
chance
but
he
must
hasten
to
babble
it
into
the
ears
of
those
who
are
nearest
to
him
at
the
moment
i
would
my
tongue
had
been
palsied
ere
i
said
a
syllable
to
yonder
proud
yet
wily
i
shall
never
see
her
more
that
is
to
be
counted
for
certain
i
shall
never
know
the
true
interpretation
of
those
mysteries
which
hang
around
her
but
to
think
i
may
have
prated
something
tending
to
throw
her
into
the
power
of
yonder
ferocious
boor
will
be
a
subject
of
remorse
to
me
while
i
live
here
he
was
startled
out
of
his
reverie
by
the
voice
of
his
father
why
how
now
boy
art
thou
waking
arthur
or
sleeping
on
thy
feet
from
the
fatigue
of
last
night
service
not
so
my
father
answered
arthur
at
once
recollecting
himself
somewhat
drowsy
perhaps
but
the
fresh
morning
air
will
soon
put
that
to
flight
walking
with
precaution
through
the
group
of
sleepers
who
lay
around
the
elder
philipson
when
they
had
gained
the
door
of
the
apartment
turned
back
and
looking
on
the
straw
couch
which
the
large
form
of
the
landamman
and
the
silvery
beard
of
his
constant
companion
touched
by
the
earliest
beams
of
light
distinguished
as
that
of
arnold
biederman
he
muttered
between
his
lips
an
involuntary
adieu
farewell
mirror
of
ancient
faith
and
integrity
farewell
noble
arnold
farewell
soul
of
truth
and
candour
to
whom
cowardice
selfishness
and
falsehood
are
alike
unknown
and
farewell
thought
his
son
to
the
loveliest
and
most
candid
yet
most
mysterious
of
maidens
but
the
adieu
as
may
well
be
believed
was
not
like
that
of
his
father
expressed
in
words
they
were
soon
after
on
the
outside
of
the
gate
the
swiss
domestic
was
liberally
recompensed
and
charged
with
a
thousand
kind
words
of
farewell
and
of
remembrance
to
the
landamman
from
his
english
guests
mingled
with
hopes
and
wishes
that
they
might
soon
meet
again
in
the
burgundian
territory
the
young
man
then
took
the
bridle
of
the
mule
and
led
the
animal
forward
on
their
journey
at
an
easy
pace
his
father
walking
by
his
side
after
a
silence
of
some
minutes
the
elder
philipson
addressed
arthur
i
fear
me
he
said
we
shall
see
the
worthy
landamman
no
more
the
youths
who
attend
him
are
bent
upon
taking
offence
the
duke
of
burgundy
will
not
fail
i
fear
to
give
them
ample
occasion
and
the
peace
which
the
excellent
man
desires
for
the
land
of
his
fathers
will
be
shipwrecked
ere
they
reach
the
duke
presence
though
even
were
it
otherwise
how
the
proudest
prince
in
europe
will
brook
the
moody
looks
of
burgesses
and
peasants
so
will
charles
of
burgundy
term
the
friends
we
have
parted
from
is
a
question
too
easily
answered
a
war
fatal
to
the
interests
of
all
concerned
save
louis
of
france
will
certainly
take
place
and
dreadful
must
be
the
contest
if
the
ranks
of
the
burgundian
chivalry
shall
encounter
those
iron
sons
of
the
mountains
before
whom
so
many
of
the
austrian
nobility
have
been
repeatedly
prostrated
i
am
so
much
convinced
of
the
truth
of
what
you
say
my
father
replied
arthur
that
i
judge
even
this
day
will
not
pass
over
without
a
breach
of
truce
i
have
already
put
on
my
shirt
of
mail
in
case
we
should
meet
bad
company
betwixt
and
brisach
and
i
would
to
heaven
that
you
would
observe
the
same
precaution
it
will
not
delay
our
journey
and
i
confess
to
you
that
i
at
least
will
travel
with
much
greater
consciousness
of
safety
should
you
do
so
i
understand
you
my
son
replied
the
elder
philipson
but
i
am
a
peaceful
traveller
in
the
duke
of
burgundy
territories
and
must
not
willingly
suppose
that
while
under
the
shadow
of
his
banner
i
must
guard
myself
against
banditti
as
if
i
were
in
the
wilds
of
palestine
as
for
the
authority
of
his
officers
and
the
extent
of
their
exactions
i
need
not
tell
you
that
they
are
in
our
circumstances
things
to
be
submitted
to
without
grief
or
grudging
leaving
the
two
travellers
to
journey
towards
brisach
at
their
leisure
i
must
transport
my
readers
to
the
eastern
gate
of
that
small
town
which
situated
on
an
eminence
had
a
commanding
prospect
on
every
side
but
especially
towards
bâle
it
did
not
properly
make
a
part
of
the
dominions
of
the
duke
of
burgundy
but
had
been
placed
in
his
hands
in
pawn
or
in
pledge
for
the
repayment
of
a
considerable
sum
of
money
due
to
charles
by
the
emperor
sigismund
of
austria
to
whom
the
seigniory
of
the
place
belonged
in
property
but
the
town
lay
so
conveniently
for
distressing
the
commerce
of
the
swiss
and
inflicting
on
that
people
whom
he
at
once
hated
and
despised
similar
marks
of
his
malevolence
as
to
encourage
a
general
opinion
that
the
duke
of
burgundy
the
implacable
and
unreasonable
enemy
of
these
mountaineers
would
never
listen
to
any
terms
of
redemption
however
equitable
or
advantageous
which
might
have
the
effect
of
restoring
to
the
emperor
an
advanced
post
of
such
consequence
to
the
gratification
of
his
dislike
as
brisach
the
situation
of
the
little
town
was
in
itself
strong
but
the
fortifications
which
surrounded
it
were
barely
sufficient
to
repel
any
sudden
attack
and
not
adequate
to
resist
for
any
length
of
time
a
formal
siege
the
morning
beams
had
shone
on
the
spire
of
the
church
for
more
than
an
hour
when
a
tall
thin
elderly
man
wrapped
in
a
morning
gown
over
which
was
buckled
a
broad
belt
supporting
on
the
left
side
a
sword
on
the
right
a
dagger
approached
the
barbican
of
the
eastern
gate
his
bonnet
displayed
a
feather
which
or
the
tail
of
a
fox
in
lieu
of
it
was
the
emblem
of
gentle
blood
throughout
all
germany
and
a
badge
highly
prized
by
those
who
had
a
right
to
wear
it
the
small
party
of
soldiers
who
had
kept
watch
there
during
the
course
of
the
preceding
night
and
supplied
sentinels
both
for
ward
and
outlook
took
arms
on
the
appearance
of
this
individual
and
drew
themselves
up
in
the
form
of
a
guard
which
receives
with
military
reverence
an
officer
of
importance
archibald
de
countenance
for
it
was
the
governor
himself
expressed
that
settled
peevishness
and
ill
temper
which
characterise
the
morning
hours
of
a
valetudinary
debauchee
his
head
throbbed
his
pulse
was
feverish
and
his
cheek
was
pale
symptoms
of
his
having
spent
the
last
night
as
was
his
usual
custom
amid
and
flagons
judging
from
the
haste
with
which
his
soldiers
fell
into
their
ranks
and
the
awe
and
silence
which
reigned
among
them
it
appeared
that
they
were
accustomed
to
expect
and
dread
his
ill
humour
on
such
occasions
he
glanced
at
them
accordingly
an
inquisitive
and
dissatisfied
look
as
if
he
sought
something
on
which
to
vent
his
peevishness
and
then
asked
for
the
loitering
dog
kilian
kilian
presently
made
his
appearance
a
stout
a
bavarian
by
birth
and
by
rank
the
personal
squire
of
the
governor
what
news
of
the
swiss
churls
kilian
demanded
archibald
de
hagenbach
they
should
by
their
thrifty
habits
have
been
on
the
road
two
hours
since
have
the
presumed
to
ape
the
manners
of
gentlemen
and
stuck
by
the
flask
till
by
my
faith
it
may
well
be
answered
kilian
the
burghers
of
bâle
gave
them
full
means
of
carousal
how
kilian
they
dared
not
offer
hospitality
to
the
swiss
drove
of
bullocks
after
the
charge
we
sent
them
to
the
contrary
nay
the
bâlese
received
them
not
into
the
town
replied
the
squire
but
i
learned
by
sure
espial
that
they
afforded
them
means
of
quartering
at
which
was
furnished
with
many
a
fair
gammon
and
pasty
to
speak
naught
of
flasks
of
barrels
of
beer
and
stoups
of
strong
waters
the
bâlese
shall
answer
this
kilian
said
the
governor
do
they
think
i
am
for
ever
to
be
thrusting
myself
between
the
duke
and
his
pleasure
on
their
behalf
the
fat
porkers
have
presumed
too
much
since
we
accepted
some
trifling
gifts
at
their
hands
more
for
gracing
of
them
than
for
any
advantage
we
could
make
of
their
paltry
donations
was
it
not
the
wine
from
bâle
which
we
were
obliged
to
drink
out
in
pint
goblets
lest
it
should
become
sour
before
morning
it
was
drunk
out
and
in
pint
goblets
too
said
kilian
so
much
i
can
well
remember
why
go
to
then
said
the
governor
they
shall
know
these
beasts
of
bâle
that
i
hold
myself
no
way
obliged
by
such
donations
as
these
and
that
my
remembrance
of
the
wines
which
i
carouse
rests
no
longer
than
the
headache
which
the
mixtures
they
drug
me
with
never
fail
of
late
years
to
leave
behind
for
the
next
morning
pastime
your
excellency
replied
the
squire
will
make
it
then
a
quarrel
between
the
duke
of
burgundy
and
the
city
of
bâle
that
they
gave
this
indirect
degree
of
comfort
and
assistance
to
the
swiss
deputation
ay
marry
will
i
said
de
hagenbach
unless
there
be
wise
men
among
them
who
shall
show
me
good
reasons
for
protecting
them
oh
the
bâlese
do
not
know
our
noble
duke
nor
the
gift
he
hath
for
chastising
the
citizens
of
a
free
town
thou
canst
tell
them
kilian
as
well
as
any
man
how
he
dealt
with
the
villains
of
liège
when
they
would
needs
be
pragmatical
i
will
apprise
them
of
the
matter
said
kilian
when
opportunity
shall
serve
and
i
trust
i
shall
find
them
in
a
temper
disposed
to
cultivate
your
honourable
friendship
nay
if
it
is
the
same
to
them
it
is
quite
indifferent
to
me
kilian
continued
the
governor
but
methinks
whole
and
sound
throats
are
worth
some
purchase
were
it
only
to
swallow
and
to
say
nothing
of
westphalian
hams
and
nierensteiner
i
say
a
slashed
throat
is
a
useless
thing
kilian
i
will
make
the
fat
citizens
to
understand
their
danger
and
the
necessity
of
making
interest
answered
kilian
sure
i
am
not
now
to
learn
how
to
turn
the
ball
into
your
excellency
lap
you
speak
well
said
sir
archibald
but
how
chanced
it
thou
hast
so
little
to
say
to
the
switzers
leaguer
i
should
have
thought
an
old
trooper
like
thee
would
have
made
their
pinions
flutter
amidst
the
good
cheer
thou
tellest
me
of
i
might
as
well
have
annoyed
an
angry
hedgehog
with
my
bare
finger
said
kilian
i
surveyed
myself
there
were
sentinels
on
the
castle
walls
a
sentinel
on
the
bridge
besides
a
regular
patrol
of
these
swiss
fellows
who
kept
strict
watch
so
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
otherwise
knowing
your
excellency
ancient
quarrel
i
would
have
had
a
hit
at
them
when
they
should
never
have
known
who
hurt
them
i
will
tell
you
however
fairly
that
these
churls
are
acquiring
better
knowledge
in
the
art
of
war
than
the
best
ritter
knight
well
they
will
be
the
better
worth
the
looking
after
when
they
arrive
said
de
hagenbach
they
come
forth
in
state
doubtless
with
all
their
finery
their
wives
chains
of
silver
their
own
medals
and
rings
of
lead
and
ah
the
base
hinds
they
are
unworthy
that
a
man
of
noble
blood
should
ease
them
of
their
trash
there
is
better
ware
among
them
if
my
intelligence
hath
not
deceived
me
replied
kilian
there
are
merchants
pshaw
the
packhorses
of
berne
and
soleure
said
the
governor
with
their
paltry
lumber
cloth
too
coarse
to
make
covers
for
horses
of
any
breeding
and
linen
that
is
more
like
than
any
composition
of
flax
i
will
strip
them
however
were
it
but
to
vex
the
knaves
what
not
content
with
claiming
to
be
treated
like
an
independent
people
and
sending
forth
deputies
and
embassies
forsooth
they
expect
i
warrant
to
make
the
indemnities
of
ambassadors
cover
the
introduction
of
a
cargo
of
their
contraband
commodities
and
thus
insult
the
noble
duke
of
burgundy
and
cheat
him
at
the
same
time
but
de
hagenbach
is
neither
knight
nor
gentleman
if
he
allow
them
to
pass
unchallenged
and
they
are
better
worth
being
stopped
said
kilian
than
your
excellency
supposes
for
they
have
english
merchants
along
with
them
and
under
their
protection
english
merchants
exclaimed
de
hagenbach
his
eyes
sparkling
with
joy
english
merchants
kilian
men
talk
of
cathay
and
ind
where
there
are
mines
of
silver
and
gold
and
diamonds
but
on
the
faith
of
a
gentleman
i
believe
these
brutish
islanders
have
the
caves
of
treasure
wholly
within
their
own
foggy
land
and
then
the
variety
of
their
rich
merchandise
ha
kilian
is
it
a
long
train
of
mules
a
jolly
tinkling
team
by
our
lady
glove
the
sound
of
it
is
already
jingling
in
my
ears
more
musically
than
all
the
harps
of
all
the
at
heilbron
nay
my
lord
there
is
no
great
train
replied
the
squire
only
two
men
as
i
am
given
to
understand
with
scarce
so
much
baggage
as
loads
a
mule
but
it
is
said
of
infinite
value
silk
and
samite
lace
and
furs
pearls
and
perfumes
from
the
east
and
from
venice
raptures
and
paradise
say
not
a
word
more
exclaimed
the
rapacious
knight
of
hagenbach
they
are
all
our
own
kilian
why
these
are
the
very
men
i
have
dreamed
of
twice
a
week
for
this
month
past
ay
two
men
of
middle
stature
or
somewhat
under
it
with
smooth
round
fair
comely
visages
having
stomachs
as
plump
as
partridges
and
purses
as
plump
as
their
stomachs
ha
what
thou
to
my
dream
kilian
only
that
to
be
quite
soothfast
answered
the
squire
it
should
have
included
the
presence
of
a
score
or
thereabouts
of
sturdy
young
giants
as
ever
climbed
cliff
or
carried
bolt
to
whistle
at
a
chamois
a
lusty
plump
of
clubs
bills
and
partisans
such
as
make
shields
crack
like
oaten
cakes
and
helmets
ring
like
the
better
knave
the
better
exclaimed
the
governor
rubbing
his
hands
english
pedlars
to
plunder
swiss
bullies
to
beat
into
submission
i
wot
well
we
can
have
nothing
of
the
helvetian
swine
save
their
beastly
bristles
it
is
lucky
they
bring
these
two
island
sheep
along
with
them
but
we
must
get
ready
our
and
clear
the
for
exercise
of
our
here
lieutenant
schonfeldt
an
officer
stepped
forth
how
many
men
are
here
on
duty
about
sixty
replied
the
officer
twenty
out
on
parties
in
different
directions
and
there
may
be
forty
or
fifty
in
their
quarters
order
them
all
under
arms
instantly
hark
ye
not
by
trumpet
or
bugle
but
by
warning
them
individually
in
their
quarters
to
draw
to
arms
as
quietly
as
possible
and
rendezvous
here
at
the
eastern
gate
tell
the
villains
there
is
booty
to
be
gained
and
they
shall
have
their
share
on
these
terms
said
schonfeldt
they
will
walk
over
a
spider
web
without
startling
the
insect
that
wove
it
i
will
collect
them
without
loss
of
an
instant
i
tell
thee
kilian
continued
the
exulting
commandant
again
speaking
apart
with
his
confidential
attendant
nothing
could
come
so
luckily
as
the
chance
of
this
onslaught
duke
charles
desires
to
affront
the
swiss
not
look
you
that
he
cares
to
act
towards
them
by
his
own
direct
orders
in
such
a
manner
as
might
be
termed
a
breach
of
public
faith
towards
a
peaceful
embassy
but
the
gallant
follower
who
shall
save
his
prince
the
scandal
of
such
an
affair
and
whose
actions
may
be
termed
a
mistake
or
misapprehension
shall
i
warrant
you
be
accounted
to
have
done
knightly
service
perchance
a
frown
may
be
passed
upon
him
in
public
but
in
private
the
duke
will
know
how
to
esteem
why
standest
thou
so
silent
man
and
what
ails
thy
ugly
aspect
thou
art
not
afraid
of
twenty
switzer
boys
and
we
at
the
head
of
such
a
band
of
spears
the
swiss
answered
kilian
will
give
and
take
good
blows
yet
i
have
no
fear
of
them
but
i
like
not
that
we
should
trust
too
much
to
duke
charles
that
he
would
be
in
the
first
instance
pleased
with
any
dishonour
done
the
swiss
is
likely
enough
but
if
as
your
excellency
hints
he
finds
it
afterwards
convenient
to
disown
the
action
he
is
a
prince
likely
to
give
a
lively
colour
to
his
disavowal
by
hanging
up
the
actors
pshaw
said
the
commandant
i
know
where
i
stand
such
a
trick
were
like
enough
to
be
played
by
louis
of
france
but
it
is
foreign
to
the
blunt
character
of
our
bold
one
of
why
the
devil
thou
still
man
simpering
like
an
ape
at
a
roasted
chestnut
which
he
thinks
too
warm
for
his
fingers
your
excellency
is
wise
as
well
as
warlike
said
the
esquire
and
it
is
not
for
me
to
contest
your
pleasure
but
this
peaceful
embassy
these
english
merchants
if
charles
goes
to
war
with
louis
as
the
rumour
is
current
what
he
should
most
of
all
desire
is
the
neutrality
of
switzerland
and
the
assistance
of
england
whose
king
is
crossing
the
sea
with
a
great
army
now
you
sir
archibald
of
hagenbach
may
well
do
that
in
the
course
of
this
very
morning
which
will
put
the
confederated
cantons
in
arms
against
charles
and
turn
the
english
from
allies
into
enemies
i
care
not
said
the
commandant
i
know
the
duke
humour
well
and
if
he
the
master
of
so
many
provinces
is
willing
to
risk
them
in
a
frolic
what
is
it
to
archibald
de
hagenbach
who
has
not
a
foot
of
land
to
lose
in
the
cause
but
you
have
life
my
lord
said
the
esquire
ay
life
replied
the
knight
a
paltry
right
to
exist
which
i
have
been
ready
to
stake
every
day
of
my
life
for
dollars
ay
and
for
kreutzers
and
think
you
i
will
hesitate
to
pledge
it
for
jewels
of
the
east
and
goldsmith
work
of
venice
no
kilian
these
english
must
be
eased
of
their
bales
that
archibald
de
hagenbach
may
drink
a
purer
flask
than
their
thin
moselle
and
wear
a
brocade
doublet
instead
of
greasy
velvet
nor
is
it
less
necessary
that
kilian
should
have
a
seemly
new
jerkin
with
a
purse
of
ducats
to
jingle
at
his
girdle
by
my
faith
said
kilian
that
last
argument
hath
disarmed
my
scruples
and
i
give
up
the
point
since
it
ill
befits
me
to
dispute
with
your
excellency
to
the
work
then
said
his
leader
but
stay
we
must
first
take
the
church
along
with
us
the
priest
of
paul
hath
been
moody
of
late
and
spread
abroad
strange
things
from
the
pulpit
as
if
we
were
little
better
than
common
pillagers
and
robbers
nay
he
hath
had
the
insolence
to
warn
me
as
he
termed
it
twice
in
strange
form
it
were
well
to
break
the
growling
mastiff
bald
head
but
since
that
might
be
ill
taken
by
the
duke
the
next
point
of
wisdom
is
to
fling
him
a
bone
he
may
be
a
dangerous
enemy
said
the
squire
dubiously
his
power
is
great
with
the
people
tush
replied
hagenbach
i
know
how
to
disarm
the
shaveling
send
to
him
and
tell
him
to
come
hither
to
speak
with
me
meanwhile
have
all
our
force
under
arms
let
the
barbican
and
barrier
be
well
manned
with
archers
station
spearmen
in
the
houses
on
each
hand
of
the
gateway
and
let
the
street
be
barricaded
with
carts
well
bound
together
but
placed
as
if
they
had
been
there
by
accident
place
a
body
of
determined
fellows
in
these
carts
and
behind
them
so
soon
as
the
merchants
and
their
mules
enter
for
that
is
the
main
point
up
with
your
drawbridge
down
with
the
portcullis
send
a
volley
of
arrows
among
those
who
are
without
if
they
make
any
scuffle
disarm
and
secure
those
who
have
entered
and
are
cooped
up
between
the
barricade
before
and
the
ambush
behind
and
around
them
and
kilian
and
then
said
his
esquire
shall
we
like
merry
free
companions
be
knuckle
deep
in
the
english
budgets
and
like
jovial
hunters
replied
the
knight
in
swiss
blood
the
game
will
stand
at
bay
though
answered
kilian
they
are
led
by
that
donnerhugel
whom
we
have
heard
of
whom
they
call
the
young
bear
of
berne
they
will
turn
to
their
defence
the
better
man
wouldst
thou
kill
sheep
rather
than
hunt
wolves
besides
our
toils
are
set
and
the
whole
garrison
shall
assist
shame
on
thee
kilian
thou
wert
not
wont
to
have
so
many
scruples
nor
have
i
now
said
kilian
but
these
swiss
bills
and
swords
of
the
breadth
of
four
inches
are
no
child
and
then
if
you
call
all
our
garrison
to
the
attack
to
whom
will
your
excellency
intrust
the
defence
of
the
other
gates
and
the
circuit
of
the
walls
lock
bolt
and
chain
up
the
gates
replied
the
governor
and
bring
the
keys
hither
there
shall
no
one
leave
the
place
till
this
affair
is
over
let
some
score
of
the
citizens
take
arms
for
the
duty
of
guarding
the
walls
and
look
they
discharge
it
well
or
i
will
lay
a
fine
on
them
which
they
shall
discharge
to
purpose
they
will
grumble
said
kilian
they
say
that
not
being
the
subjects
though
the
place
is
impledged
to
his
grace
they
are
not
liable
to
military
service
they
lie
the
cowardly
slaves
answered
de
hagenbach
if
i
have
not
employed
them
much
hitherto
it
is
because
i
scorn
their
assistance
nor
would
i
now
use
their
help
were
it
for
anything
save
to
keep
a
watch
by
looking
out
straight
before
them
let
them
obey
as
they
respect
their
property
persons
and
families
a
deep
voice
behind
them
repeated
the
emphatic
language
of
scripture
i
have
seen
the
wicked
man
flourish
in
his
power
even
like
unto
a
laurel
but
i
returned
and
he
was
not
yea
i
sought
him
but
he
was
not
to
be
found
sir
archibald
de
hagenbach
turned
sternly
and
encountered
the
dark
and
ominous
looks
of
the
priest
of
paul
dressed
in
the
vestments
of
his
order
we
are
busy
father
said
the
governor
and
will
hear
your
preachment
another
time
i
come
by
your
summons
sir
governor
said
the
priest
or
i
had
not
intruded
myself
where
i
well
knew
my
preachments
if
you
term
them
so
will
do
no
good
oh
i
crave
your
mercy
reverend
father
said
de
hagenbach
yes
it
is
true
that
i
did
send
for
you
to
desire
your
prayers
and
kind
intercession
with
our
lady
and
paul
in
some
transactions
which
are
likely
to
occur
this
morning
and
in
which
as
the
lombard
says
i
do
espy
di
sir
archibald
answered
the
priest
calmly
i
well
hope
and
trust
that
you
do
not
forget
the
nature
of
the
glorified
saints
so
far
as
to
ask
them
for
their
blessing
upon
such
exploits
as
you
have
been
too
oft
engaged
in
since
your
arrival
amongst
us
an
event
which
of
itself
gave
token
of
the
divine
anger
nay
let
me
say
humble
as
i
am
that
decency
to
a
servant
of
the
altar
should
check
you
from
proposing
to
me
to
put
up
prayers
for
the
success
of
pillage
and
robbery
i
understand
you
father
said
the
rapacious
governor
and
you
shall
see
i
do
while
you
are
the
duke
subject
you
must
by
your
office
put
up
your
prayers
for
his
success
in
matters
that
are
fairly
managed
you
acknowledge
this
with
a
graceful
bend
of
your
reverend
head
well
then
i
will
be
as
reasonable
as
you
are
say
we
desire
the
intercession
of
the
good
saints
and
of
you
their
pious
orator
in
something
a
little
out
of
the
ordinary
path
and
if
you
will
somewhat
of
a
doubtful
complexion
are
we
entitled
to
ask
you
or
them
for
their
pains
and
trouble
without
a
just
consideration
surely
no
therefore
i
vow
and
solemnly
promise
that
if
i
have
good
fortune
in
this
morning
adventure
paul
shall
have
an
and
a
basin
of
silver
large
or
little
as
my
booty
will
permit
our
lady
a
web
of
satin
for
a
full
suit
with
a
necklace
of
pearl
for
holidays
and
thou
priest
some
twenty
pieces
of
broad
english
gold
for
acting
as
betwixt
ourselves
and
the
blessed
apostles
whom
we
acknowledge
ourselves
unworthy
to
negotiate
with
in
our
profane
person
and
now
sir
priest
do
we
understand
each
other
for
i
have
little
time
to
lose
i
know
you
have
hard
thoughts
of
me
but
you
see
the
devil
is
not
quite
so
horrible
as
he
is
painted
do
we
understand
each
other
answered
the
black
priest
of
paul
repeating
the
governor
question
alas
no
and
i
fear
me
we
never
shall
hast
thou
never
heard
the
words
spoken
by
the
holy
hermit
berchtold
of
offringen
to
the
implacable
queen
agnes
who
had
revenged
with
such
dreadful
severity
the
assassination
of
her
father
the
emperor
albert
not
i
returned
the
knight
i
have
neither
studied
the
chronicles
of
emperors
nor
the
legends
of
hermits
and
therefore
sir
priest
an
you
like
not
my
proposal
let
us
have
no
further
words
on
the
matter
i
am
unwont
to
press
my
favours
or
to
deal
with
priests
who
require
entreaty
when
gifts
are
held
out
to
them
hear
yet
the
words
of
the
holy
man
said
the
priest
the
time
may
come
and
that
shortly
when
you
would
gladly
desire
to
hear
what
you
scornfully
reject
speak
on
but
be
brief
said
archibald
de
hagenbach
and
know
though
thou
mayst
terrify
or
cajole
the
multitude
thou
now
speakest
to
one
whose
resolution
is
fixed
far
beyond
the
power
of
thy
eloquence
to
melt
know
then
said
the
priest
of
paul
that
agnes
daughter
of
the
murdered
albert
after
shedding
oceans
of
blood
in
avenging
his
bloody
death
founded
at
length
the
rich
abbey
of
königsfeldt
and
that
it
might
have
a
superior
claim
to
renowned
sanctity
made
a
pilgrimage
in
person
to
the
cell
of
the
holy
hermit
and
besought
of
him
to
honour
her
abbey
by
taking
up
his
residence
there
but
what
was
his
reply
mark
it
and
tremble
ruthless
woman
said
the
holy
man
will
not
be
served
with
and
rejects
the
gifts
which
are
obtained
by
violence
and
robbery
the
almighty
loves
mercy
justice
and
humanity
and
by
the
lovers
of
these
only
will
he
be
worshipped
and
now
archibald
of
hagenbach
once
twice
thrice
hast
thou
had
warning
live
as
becomes
a
man
on
whom
sentence
is
passed
and
who
must
expect
execution
having
spoken
these
words
with
a
menacing
tone
and
frowning
aspect
the
priest
of
paul
turned
away
from
the
governor
whose
first
impulse
was
to
command
him
to
be
arrested
but
when
he
recollected
the
serious
consequences
which
attached
to
the
laying
violent
hands
on
a
priest
he
suffered
him
to
depart
in
peace
conscious
that
his
own
unpopularity
might
render
any
attempt
to
revenge
himself
an
act
of
great
rashness
he
called
therefore
for
a
beaker
of
burgundy
in
which
he
swallowed
down
his
displeasure
and
had
just
returned
to
kilian
the
cup
which
he
had
drained
to
the
bottom
when
the
warden
winded
a
blast
from
the
which
betokened
the
arrival
of
strangers
at
the
gate
of
the
city
chapter
xiv
i
will
resist
such
entertainment
till
my
enemy
has
more
power
that
blast
was
but
feebly
blown
said
de
hagenbach
ascending
to
the
ramparts
from
which
he
could
see
what
passed
on
the
outside
of
the
gate
who
approaches
kilian
the
trusty
squire
was
hastening
to
meet
him
with
the
news
two
men
with
a
mule
an
it
please
your
excellency
and
merchants
i
presume
them
to
be
merchants
villain
pedlars
you
mean
heard
ever
man
of
english
merchants
tramping
it
on
foot
with
no
more
baggage
than
one
mule
can
manage
to
carry
they
must
be
beggarly
bohemians
or
those
whom
the
french
people
call
escossais
the
knaves
they
shall
pay
with
the
pining
of
their
paunches
for
the
poverty
of
their
purses
do
not
be
too
hasty
an
please
your
excellency
quoth
the
squire
small
budgets
hold
rich
goods
but
rich
or
poor
they
are
our
men
at
least
they
have
all
the
marks
the
elder
and
may
write
fifty
and
five
years
a
beard
somewhat
grizzled
the
younger
some
taller
than
the
first
and
a
lad
with
a
smooth
chin
and
mustaches
let
them
be
admitted
said
the
governor
turning
back
in
order
again
to
descend
to
the
street
and
bring
them
into
the
of
the
so
saying
he
betook
himself
to
the
place
appointed
which
was
an
apartment
in
the
large
tower
that
protected
the
eastern
gateway
in
which
were
deposited
the
rack
with
various
other
instruments
of
torture
which
the
cruel
and
rapacious
governor
was
in
the
habit
of
applying
to
such
prisoners
from
whom
he
was
desirous
of
extorting
either
booty
or
information
he
entered
the
apartment
which
was
dimly
lighted
and
had
a
lofty
gothic
roof
which
could
be
but
imperfectly
seen
while
nooses
and
cords
hanging
down
from
thence
announced
a
fearful
connection
with
various
implements
of
rusted
iron
that
hung
round
the
walls
or
lay
scattered
on
the
floor
a
faint
stream
of
light
through
one
of
the
numerous
and
narrow
slits
or
with
which
the
walls
were
garnished
fell
directly
upon
the
person
and
visage
of
a
tall
swarthy
man
seated
in
what
but
for
the
partial
illumination
would
have
been
an
obscure
corner
of
this
apartment
his
features
were
regular
and
even
handsome
but
of
a
character
peculiarly
stern
and
sinister
this
person
dress
was
a
cloak
of
scarlet
his
head
was
bare
and
surrounded
by
shaggy
locks
of
black
which
time
had
partly
grizzled
he
was
busily
employed
in
furbishing
and
burnishing
a
broad
sword
of
a
peculiar
shape
and
considerably
shorter
than
the
weapons
of
that
kind
which
we
have
described
as
used
by
the
swiss
he
was
so
deeply
engaged
in
his
task
that
he
started
as
the
heavy
door
opened
with
a
jarring
noise
and
the
sword
escaping
from
his
hold
rolled
on
the
stone
floor
with
a
heavy
clash
ha
scharfgerichter
said
the
knight
as
he
entered
the
thou
art
preparing
for
thy
duty
it
would
ill
become
your
excellency
servant
answered
the
man
in
a
harsh
deep
tone
to
be
found
idle
but
the
prisoner
is
not
far
off
as
i
can
judge
by
the
fall
of
my
sword
which
infallibly
announces
the
presence
of
him
who
shall
feel
its
edge
the
prisoners
are
at
hand
francis
replied
the
governor
but
thy
omen
has
deceived
thee
for
once
they
are
fellows
for
whom
a
good
rope
will
suffice
and
thy
sword
drinks
only
noble
blood
the
worse
for
francis
steinernherz
replied
the
official
in
scarlet
i
trusted
that
your
excellency
who
have
ever
been
a
bountiful
patron
should
this
day
have
made
me
noble
noble
said
the
governor
thou
art
mad
thou
noble
the
common
executioner
and
wherefore
not
sir
archibald
de
hagenbach
i
think
the
name
of
francis
steinernherz
will
suit
nobility
being
fairly
and
legally
won
as
well
as
another
nay
do
not
stare
on
me
thus
if
one
of
my
profession
shall
do
his
grim
office
on
nine
men
of
noble
birth
with
the
same
weapon
and
with
a
single
blow
to
each
patient
hath
he
not
a
right
to
his
freedom
from
taxes
and
his
nobility
by
patent
so
says
the
law
said
sir
archibald
after
reflecting
for
a
moment
but
rather
more
in
scorn
than
seriously
i
should
judge
since
no
one
was
ever
known
to
claim
the
benefit
of
it
the
prouder
boast
for
him
said
the
functionary
that
shall
be
the
first
to
demand
the
honours
due
to
a
sharp
sword
and
a
clean
stroke
i
francis
steinernherz
will
be
the
first
noble
of
my
profession
when
i
shall
have
despatched
one
more
knight
of
the
empire
thou
hast
been
ever
in
service
hast
thou
not
demanded
de
hagenbach
under
what
other
master
replied
the
executioner
could
i
have
enjoyed
such
constant
practice
i
have
executed
your
decrees
on
condemned
sinners
since
i
could
swing
a
scourge
lift
a
crowbar
or
wield
this
trusty
weapon
and
who
can
say
i
ever
failed
of
my
first
blow
or
needed
to
deal
a
second
tristrem
of
the
hospital
and
his
famous
assistants
petit
andré
and
trois
eschelles
are
novices
compared
with
me
in
the
use
of
the
noble
and
knightly
sword
marry
i
should
be
ashamed
to
match
myself
with
them
in
the
field
practice
with
bowstring
and
dagger
these
are
no
feats
worthy
of
a
christian
man
who
would
rise
to
honour
and
nobility
thou
art
a
fellow
of
excellent
address
and
i
do
not
deny
it
replied
de
hagenbach
but
it
can
not
be
i
trust
it
can
not
be
that
when
noble
blood
is
becoming
scarce
in
the
land
and
proud
churls
are
lording
it
over
knights
and
barons
i
myself
should
have
caused
so
much
to
be
spilled
i
will
number
the
patients
to
your
excellency
by
name
and
title
said
francis
drawing
out
a
scroll
of
parchment
and
reading
with
a
commentary
as
he
went
on
there
was
count
william
of
elvershoe
he
was
my
a
sweet
youth
and
died
most
like
a
christian
i
remember
he
was
indeed
a
most
smart
youth
and
courted
my
mistress
said
sir
archibald
he
died
on
jude
in
the
year
of
grace
said
the
executioner
go
on
but
name
no
dates
said
the
governor
sir
miles
of
stockenborg
he
drove
off
my
cattle
observed
his
excellency
sir
louis
of
riesenfeldt
continued
the
executioner
he
made
love
to
my
wife
commented
the
governor
the
three
of
lammerbourg
you
made
their
father
the
count
childless
in
one
day
and
he
made
me
landless
said
sir
archibald
so
that
account
is
thou
needest
read
no
further
he
continued
i
admit
thy
record
though
it
is
written
in
letters
somewhat
of
the
reddest
i
had
counted
these
three
young
gentlemen
as
one
execution
you
did
me
the
greater
wrong
said
francis
they
cost
three
good
separate
blows
of
this
good
sword
be
it
so
and
god
be
with
their
souls
said
hagenbach
but
thy
ambition
must
go
to
sleep
for
a
while
scharfgerichter
for
the
stuff
that
came
hither
is
for
dungeon
and
cord
or
perhaps
a
touch
of
the
rack
or
strappado
there
is
no
honour
to
win
on
them
the
worse
luck
mine
said
the
executioner
i
had
dreamed
so
surely
that
your
honour
had
made
me
noble
and
then
the
fall
of
my
sword
take
a
bowl
of
wine
and
forget
your
auguries
with
your
honour
permission
no
said
the
executioner
to
drink
before
noon
were
to
endanger
the
nicety
of
my
hand
be
silent
then
and
mind
your
duty
said
de
hagenbach
francis
took
up
his
sheathless
sword
wiped
the
dust
reverently
from
it
and
withdrew
into
a
corner
of
the
chamber
where
he
stood
leaning
with
his
hands
on
the
pommel
of
the
fatal
weapon
almost
immediately
afterwards
kilian
entered
at
the
head
of
five
or
six
soldiers
conducting
the
two
philipsons
whose
arms
were
tied
down
with
cords
approach
me
a
chair
said
the
governor
and
took
his
place
gravely
beside
a
table
on
which
stood
who
are
these
men
kilian
and
wherefore
are
they
bound
so
please
your
excellency
said
kilian
with
a
deep
respect
of
manner
which
entirely
differed
from
the
tone
approaching
to
familiarity
with
which
he
communicated
with
his
master
in
private
we
thought
it
well
that
these
two
strangers
should
not
appear
armed
in
your
gracious
presence
and
when
we
required
of
them
to
surrender
their
weapons
at
the
gate
as
is
the
custom
of
the
garrison
this
young
gallant
must
needs
offer
resistance
i
admit
he
gave
up
his
weapon
at
his
father
command
it
is
false
exclaimed
young
philipson
but
his
father
making
a
sign
to
him
to
be
silent
he
obeyed
instantly
noble
sir
said
the
elder
philipson
we
are
strangers
and
unacquainted
with
the
rules
of
this
citadel
we
are
englishmen
and
unaccustomed
to
submit
to
personal
mishandling
we
trust
you
will
have
excuse
for
us
when
we
found
ourselves
without
any
explanation
of
the
cause
rudely
seized
on
by
we
knew
not
whom
my
son
who
is
young
and
unthinking
did
partly
draw
his
weapon
but
desisted
at
my
command
without
having
altogether
unsheathed
his
sword
far
less
made
a
blow
for
myself
i
am
a
merchant
accustomed
to
submit
to
the
laws
and
customs
of
the
countries
in
which
i
traffic
i
am
in
the
territories
of
the
duke
of
burgundy
and
i
know
his
laws
and
customs
must
be
just
and
equitable
he
is
the
powerful
and
faithful
ally
of
england
and
i
fear
nothing
while
under
his
banner
hem
hem
replied
de
hagenbach
a
little
disconcerted
by
the
englishman
composure
and
perhaps
recollecting
that
unless
his
passions
were
awakened
as
in
the
case
of
the
swiss
whom
he
detested
charles
of
burgundy
deserved
the
character
of
a
just
though
severe
prince
fair
words
are
well
but
hardly
make
amends
for
foul
actions
you
have
drawn
swords
in
riot
and
opposition
to
the
soldiers
when
obeying
the
mandates
which
regulate
their
watch
surely
sir
answered
philipson
this
is
a
severe
construction
of
a
most
natural
action
but
in
a
word
if
you
are
disposed
to
be
rigorous
the
simple
action
of
drawing
or
attempting
to
draw
a
sword
in
a
garrison
town
is
only
punishable
by
pecuniary
fine
and
such
we
must
pay
if
it
be
your
will
now
here
is
a
silly
sheep
said
kilian
to
the
executioner
beside
whom
he
had
stationed
himself
somewhat
apart
from
the
group
who
voluntarily
offers
his
own
fleece
to
the
clipper
it
will
scarcely
serve
as
a
ransom
for
his
throat
sir
squire
answered
francis
steinernherz
for
look
you
i
dreamed
last
night
that
our
master
made
me
noble
and
i
knew
by
the
fall
of
my
sword
that
this
is
the
man
by
whom
i
am
to
mount
to
gentility
i
must
this
very
day
deal
on
him
with
my
good
sword
why
thou
ambitious
fool
said
the
esquire
this
is
no
noble
but
an
island
pedlar
a
mere
english
citizen
thou
art
deceived
said
the
executioner
and
hast
never
looked
on
men
when
they
are
about
to
die
have
i
not
said
the
squire
have
i
not
looked
on
five
pitched
fields
besides
skirmishes
and
ambuscades
innumerable
that
tries
not
the
courage
said
the
scharfgerichter
all
men
will
fight
when
pitched
against
each
other
so
will
the
most
paltry
curs
so
will
the
dunghill
fowls
but
he
is
brave
and
noble
who
can
look
on
a
scaffold
and
a
block
a
priest
to
give
him
absolution
and
the
headsman
and
good
sword
which
is
to
mow
him
down
in
his
strength
as
he
would
look
upon
things
indifferent
and
such
a
man
is
that
whom
we
now
behold
yes
answered
kilian
but
that
man
looks
not
on
such
an
apparatus
he
only
sees
our
illustrious
patron
sir
archibald
de
hagenbach
and
he
who
looks
upon
sir
archibald
said
the
executioner
being
as
yonder
man
assuredly
is
a
person
of
sense
and
apprehension
looks
he
not
upon
sword
and
headsman
assuredly
that
prisoner
apprehends
as
much
and
being
so
composed
as
he
is
under
such
conviction
it
shows
him
to
be
a
nobleman
by
blood
or
may
i
myself
never
win
nobility
our
master
will
come
to
compromise
with
him
i
judge
replied
kilian
he
looks
smilingly
on
him
never
trust
to
me
then
said
the
man
in
scarlet
there
is
a
glance
in
sir
archibald
eye
which
betokens
blood
as
surely
as
the
bodes
pestilence
while
these
dependants
of
sir
archibald
de
hagenbach
were
thus
conversing
apart
their
master
had
engaged
the
prisoners
in
a
long
train
of
captious
interrogatories
concerning
their
business
in
switzerland
their
connection
with
the
landamman
and
the
cause
of
their
travelling
into
burgundy
to
all
which
the
senior
philipson
gave
direct
and
plain
answers
excepting
to
the
last
he
was
going
he
said
into
burgundy
for
the
purpose
of
his
traffic
his
wares
were
at
the
disposal
of
the
governor
who
might
detain
all
or
any
part
of
them
as
he
might
be
disposed
to
make
himself
answerable
to
his
master
but
his
business
with
the
duke
was
of
a
private
nature
respecting
some
particular
matters
of
commerce
in
which
others
as
well
as
he
himself
were
interested
to
the
duke
alone
he
declared
would
he
communicate
the
affair
and
he
pressed
it
strongly
on
the
governor
that
if
he
should
sustain
any
damage
in
his
own
person
or
that
of
his
son
the
duke
severe
displeasure
would
be
the
inevitable
consequence
de
hagenbach
was
evidently
much
embarrassed
by
the
steady
tone
of
his
prisoner
and
more
than
once
held
counsel
with
the
bottle
his
oracle
in
cases
of
extreme
difficulty
philipson
had
readily
surrendered
to
the
governor
a
list
or
invoice
of
his
merchandise
which
was
of
so
inviting
a
character
that
sir
archibald
absolutely
gloated
over
it
after
remaining
in
deep
meditation
for
some
time
he
raised
his
head
and
spoke
thus
you
must
be
well
aware
sir
merchant
that
it
is
the
duke
pleasure
that
no
swiss
merchandise
shall
pass
through
his
territories
and
that
nevertheless
you
having
been
by
your
own
account
some
time
in
that
country
and
having
also
accompanied
a
body
of
men
calling
themselves
swiss
deputies
i
am
authorised
to
believe
that
these
valuable
articles
are
rather
the
property
of
those
persons
than
of
a
single
individual
of
so
poor
an
appearance
as
yourself
and
that
should
i
demand
pecuniary
satisfaction
three
hundred
pieces
of
gold
would
not
be
an
extravagant
fine
for
so
bold
a
practice
and
you
might
wander
where
you
will
with
the
rest
of
your
wares
so
you
bring
them
not
into
burgundy
but
it
is
to
burgundy
and
to
the
duke
presence
that
i
am
expressly
bound
said
the
englishman
if
i
go
not
thither
my
journey
is
wrecked
and
the
duke
displeasure
is
certain
to
light
on
those
who
may
molest
me
for
i
make
your
excellency
aware
that
your
gracious
prince
already
knows
of
my
journey
and
will
make
strict
inquiry
where
and
by
whom
i
have
been
intercepted
again
the
governor
was
silent
endeavouring
to
decide
how
he
might
best
reconcile
the
gratification
of
his
rapacity
with
precaution
for
his
safety
after
a
few
minutes
consideration
he
again
addressed
his
prisoner
thou
art
very
positive
in
thy
tale
my
good
friend
but
my
orders
are
equally
so
to
exclude
merchandise
coming
from
switzerland
what
if
i
put
thy
mule
and
baggage
under
arrest
i
can
not
withstand
your
power
my
lord
to
do
what
you
will
i
will
in
that
case
go
to
the
duke
footstool
and
do
my
errand
there
ay
and
my
errand
also
answered
the
governor
that
is
thou
wilt
carry
thy
complaint
to
the
duke
against
the
governor
of
la
ferette
for
executing
his
orders
too
strictly
on
my
life
and
honest
word
answered
the
englishman
i
will
make
no
complaint
leave
me
but
my
ready
money
without
which
i
can
hardly
travel
to
the
duke
court
and
i
will
look
no
more
after
these
goods
and
wares
than
the
stag
looks
after
the
antlers
which
he
shed
last
year
again
the
governor
of
la
ferette
looked
doubtful
and
shook
his
head
men
in
such
a
case
as
yours
he
said
can
not
be
trusted
nor
to
say
truth
is
it
reasonable
to
expect
they
should
be
trustworthy
these
same
wares
designed
for
the
duke
private
hand
in
what
do
they
consist
they
are
under
seal
replied
the
englishman
they
are
of
rare
value
doubtless
continued
the
governor
i
can
not
tell
answered
the
elder
philipson
i
know
the
duke
sets
great
store
by
them
but
your
excellency
knows
that
great
princes
sometimes
place
a
high
value
on
trifles
bear
you
them
about
you
said
the
governor
take
heed
how
you
answer
look
around
you
on
these
engines
which
can
bring
a
dumb
man
to
speak
and
consider
i
have
the
power
to
employ
them
and
i
the
courage
to
support
their
worst
infliction
answered
philipson
with
the
same
impenetrable
coolness
which
he
had
maintained
throughout
the
whole
conference
remember
also
said
hagenbach
that
i
can
have
your
person
searched
as
thoroughly
as
your
mails
and
budgets
i
do
remember
that
i
am
wholly
in
thy
power
and
that
i
may
leave
thee
no
excuse
for
employing
force
on
a
peaceful
traveller
i
will
own
to
you
said
philipson
that
i
have
the
duke
packet
in
the
bosom
of
my
doublet
bring
it
forth
answered
the
governor
my
hands
are
tied
both
in
honour
and
literally
said
the
englishman
pluck
it
from
his
bosom
kilian
said
sir
archibald
let
us
see
this
gear
he
talks
of
could
resistance
avail
replied
the
stout
merchant
you
should
pluck
forth
my
heart
first
but
i
pray
all
who
are
present
to
observe
that
the
seals
are
every
one
whole
and
unbroken
at
this
moment
when
it
is
forcibly
taken
from
my
person
as
he
spoke
thus
he
looked
around
on
the
soldiers
whose
presence
de
hagenbach
had
perhaps
forgotten
how
dog
said
sir
archibald
giving
way
to
his
passion
would
you
stir
up
mutiny
among
my
kilian
let
the
soldiers
wait
without
so
saying
he
hastily
placed
under
cover
of
his
own
robe
the
small
but
remarkably
packet
which
kilian
had
taken
from
the
merchant
person
the
soldiers
withdrew
lingering
however
and
looking
back
like
children
brought
away
from
a
show
before
its
final
conclusion
so
fellow
again
began
de
hagenbach
we
are
now
more
private
wilt
thou
deal
more
on
the
level
with
me
and
tell
me
what
this
packet
is
and
whence
it
comes
could
all
your
garrison
be
crowded
into
this
room
i
can
only
answer
as
the
contents
i
do
not
precisely
know
the
person
by
whom
it
was
sent
i
am
determined
not
to
name
perhaps
your
son
said
the
governor
may
be
more
compliant
he
can
not
tell
you
that
of
which
he
is
himself
ignorant
answered
the
merchant
perchance
the
rack
may
make
you
both
find
your
tongues
and
we
will
try
it
on
the
young
fellow
first
kilian
since
thou
knowest
we
have
seen
men
shrink
from
beholding
the
wrenched
joints
of
their
children
that
would
have
committed
their
own
old
sinews
to
the
stretching
with
much
endurance
you
may
make
the
trial
said
arthur
and
heaven
will
give
me
strength
to
endure
and
me
courage
to
behold
added
his
father
all
this
while
the
governor
was
turning
and
the
little
packet
in
his
hand
curiously
inspecting
every
fold
and
regretting
doubtless
in
secret
that
a
few
patches
of
wax
placed
under
an
envelope
of
crimson
satin
and
ligatures
of
twisted
silk
cord
should
prevent
his
eager
eyes
from
ascertaining
the
nature
of
the
treasure
which
he
doubted
not
it
concealed
at
length
he
again
called
in
the
soldiers
and
delivered
up
the
two
prisoners
to
their
charge
commanding
that
they
should
be
kept
safely
and
in
separate
holds
and
that
the
father
in
particular
should
be
most
carefully
looked
after
i
take
you
all
here
to
witness
exclaimed
the
elder
philipson
despising
the
menacing
signs
of
de
hagenbach
that
the
governor
detains
from
me
a
packet
addressed
to
his
most
gracious
lord
and
master
the
duke
of
burgundy
de
hagenbach
actually
foamed
at
the
mouth
with
passion
and
should
i
detain
it
he
exclaimed
in
a
voice
inarticulate
with
rage
may
there
not
be
some
foul
practice
against
the
life
of
our
most
gracious
sovereign
by
poison
or
otherwise
in
this
suspicious
packet
brought
by
a
most
suspicious
bearer
have
we
never
heard
of
poisons
which
do
their
work
by
the
smell
and
shall
we
who
keep
the
gate
as
i
may
say
of
his
grace
of
burgundy
dominions
give
access
to
what
may
rob
europe
of
its
pride
of
chivalry
burgundy
of
its
prince
and
flanders
of
her
father
no
away
with
these
miscreants
soldiers
down
to
the
lowest
dungeons
with
them
keep
them
separate
and
watch
them
carefully
this
treasonable
practice
has
been
meditated
with
the
connivance
of
berne
and
soleure
thus
sir
archibald
de
hagenbach
raved
with
a
raised
voice
and
inflamed
countenance
lashing
himself
as
it
were
into
passion
until
the
steps
of
the
soldiers
and
the
clash
of
their
arms
as
they
retired
with
the
prisoners
were
no
longer
audible
his
complexion
when
these
had
ceased
waxed
paler
than
was
natural
to
him
his
brow
was
furrowed
with
anxious
wrinkles
and
his
voice
became
lower
and
more
hesitating
than
ordinary
as
turning
to
his
esquire
he
said
kilian
we
stand
upon
a
slippery
plank
with
a
raging
torrent
beneath
us
what
is
to
be
done
illustration
the
examination
drawn
and
etched
by
de
los
rios
marry
to
move
forward
with
a
resolved
yet
prudent
step
answered
the
crafty
kilian
it
is
unlucky
that
all
these
fellows
should
have
seen
the
packet
and
heard
the
appeal
of
yonder
trader
but
this
ill
luck
has
befallen
us
and
the
packet
having
been
in
your
excellency
hands
you
will
have
all
the
credit
of
having
broken
the
seals
for
though
you
leave
them
as
entire
as
the
moment
they
were
impressed
it
will
only
be
supposed
they
have
been
ingeniously
replaced
let
us
see
what
are
the
contents
before
we
determine
what
is
to
be
done
with
them
they
must
be
of
rare
value
since
the
churl
merchant
was
well
contented
to
leave
behind
all
his
rich
of
merchandise
so
that
this
precious
packet
might
pass
unexamined
they
may
be
papers
on
some
political
matter
many
such
and
of
high
importance
pass
secretly
between
edward
of
england
and
our
bold
duke
such
was
the
reply
of
de
hagenbach
if
they
be
papers
of
consequence
to
the
duke
answered
kilian
we
can
forward
them
to
or
they
may
be
such
as
louis
of
france
would
purchase
with
their
weight
of
gold
for
shame
kilian
said
the
knight
wouldst
thou
have
me
betray
my
master
secrets
to
the
king
of
france
sooner
would
i
lay
my
head
on
the
block
indeed
and
yet
your
excellency
hesitates
not
to
here
the
squire
stopped
apparently
for
fear
of
giving
offence
by
affixing
a
name
too
broad
and
intelligible
to
the
practices
of
his
patron
to
plunder
the
duke
thou
wouldst
say
thou
impudent
slave
and
saying
so
thou
wouldst
be
as
dull
as
thou
art
wont
to
be
answered
de
hagenbach
i
partake
indeed
in
the
plunder
which
the
duke
takes
from
aliens
and
reason
good
even
so
the
hound
and
the
hawk
have
their
share
of
the
quarry
they
bring
down
ay
and
the
lion
share
too
unless
the
huntsman
or
falconer
be
all
the
nearer
to
them
such
are
the
perquisites
of
my
rank
and
the
duke
who
placed
me
here
for
the
gratification
of
his
resentment
and
the
bettering
of
my
fortune
does
not
grudge
them
to
a
faithful
servant
and
indeed
i
may
term
myself
in
so
far
as
this
territory
of
la
ferette
extends
the
full
representative
or
as
it
may
be
termed
alter
ego
and
thereupon
i
will
open
this
packet
which
being
addressed
to
him
is
thereby
equally
addressed
to
me
having
thus
in
a
manner
talked
himself
up
to
an
idea
of
his
own
high
authority
he
cut
the
strings
of
the
packet
which
he
had
all
this
while
held
in
his
hand
and
undoing
the
outer
coverings
produced
a
very
small
case
made
of
sandalwood
the
contents
he
said
had
need
to
be
valuable
as
they
lie
in
so
little
compass
so
saying
he
pressed
the
spring
and
the
casket
opening
displayed
a
necklace
of
diamonds
distinguished
by
brilliancy
and
size
and
apparently
of
extraordinary
value
the
eyes
of
the
avaricious
governor
and
his
no
less
rapacious
attendant
were
so
dazzled
with
the
unusual
splendour
that
for
some
time
they
could
express
nothing
save
joy
and
surprise
ay
marry
sir
said
kilian
the
obstinate
old
knave
had
reasons
for
his
hardihood
my
own
joints
should
have
stood
a
strain
or
two
ere
i
surrendered
such
sparklers
as
and
now
sir
archibald
may
your
trusty
follower
ask
you
how
this
booty
is
to
be
divided
between
the
duke
and
his
governor
according
to
the
most
approved
rules
of
garrison
towns
faith
we
will
suppose
the
garrison
stormed
kilian
and
in
a
storm
thou
the
first
finder
takes
all
with
due
consideration
always
of
his
trusty
followers
as
myself
for
example
said
kilian
ay
and
myself
for
example
answered
a
voice
which
sounded
like
the
echo
of
the
esquire
words
from
the
remote
corner
of
the
ancient
apartment
we
are
overheard
exclaimed
the
governor
starting
and
laying
his
hand
on
his
dagger
only
by
a
faithful
follower
as
the
worthy
esquire
observes
said
the
executioner
moving
slowly
forward
villain
how
didst
thou
dare
watch
me
said
sir
archibald
de
hagenbach
trouble
not
yourself
for
that
sir
said
kilian
honest
steinernherz
has
no
tongue
to
speak
or
ear
to
hear
save
according
to
your
pleasure
indeed
we
must
shortly
have
taken
him
into
our
counsels
seeing
these
men
must
be
dealt
upon
and
that
speedily
indeed
said
de
hagenbach
i
had
thought
they
might
be
spared
to
tell
the
duke
of
burgundy
how
the
governor
of
la
ferette
accounts
to
his
treasurer
for
the
duties
and
forfeitures
at
his
demanded
kilian
is
true
said
the
knight
dead
men
have
neither
teeth
nor
tongue
they
bite
not
and
they
tell
no
tales
thou
wilt
take
order
with
them
scharfgerichter
i
will
my
lord
answered
the
executioner
on
condition
that
if
this
must
be
in
the
way
of
dungeon
execution
which
i
call
cellar
practice
my
privilege
to
claim
nobility
shall
be
saved
and
reserved
to
me
and
the
execution
shall
be
declared
to
be
as
effectual
to
my
claim
as
it
might
have
been
if
the
blow
had
been
dealt
in
broad
daylight
with
my
honourable
blade
of
office
de
hagenbach
stared
at
the
executioner
as
not
understanding
what
he
meant
on
which
kilian
took
occasion
to
explain
that
the
scharfgerichter
was
strongly
impressed
from
the
free
and
dauntless
conduct
of
the
elder
prisoner
that
he
was
a
man
of
noble
blood
from
whose
decapitation
he
would
himself
derive
all
the
advantages
proposed
to
the
headsman
who
should
execute
his
function
on
nine
men
of
illustrious
extraction
he
may
be
right
said
sir
archibald
for
here
is
a
slip
of
parchment
commending
the
bearer
of
this
carcanet
to
the
duke
desiring
him
to
accept
it
as
a
true
token
from
one
well
known
to
him
and
to
give
the
bearer
full
credence
in
all
that
he
should
say
on
the
part
of
those
by
whom
he
is
sent
by
whom
is
the
note
signed
if
i
may
make
bold
to
ask
said
kilian
there
is
no
name
the
duke
must
be
supposed
to
collect
that
information
from
the
gems
or
perhaps
the
handwriting
on
neither
of
which
he
is
likely
to
have
a
speedy
opportunity
of
exercising
his
ingenuity
said
kilian
de
hagenbach
looked
at
the
diamonds
and
smiled
darkly
the
scharfgerichter
encouraged
by
the
familiarity
into
which
he
had
in
a
manner
forced
himself
returned
to
his
plea
and
insisted
on
the
nobility
of
the
supposed
merchant
such
a
trust
and
such
a
letter
of
unlimited
credence
could
never
he
contended
be
intrusted
to
a
man
meanly
born
thou
art
deceived
thou
fool
said
the
knight
kings
now
use
the
lowest
tools
to
do
their
dearest
offices
louis
has
set
the
example
of
putting
his
barber
and
the
valets
of
his
chamber
to
do
the
work
formerly
intrusted
to
dukes
and
peers
and
other
monarchs
begin
to
think
that
it
is
better
in
choosing
their
agents
for
important
affairs
to
judge
rather
by
the
quality
of
men
brains
than
that
of
their
blood
and
as
for
the
stately
look
and
bold
bearing
which
distinguish
yonder
fellow
in
the
eyes
of
cravens
like
thee
it
belongs
to
his
country
not
his
rank
thou
it
is
in
england
as
in
flanders
where
a
burgher
of
ghent
liège
or
ypres
is
as
distinct
an
animal
from
a
knight
of
hainault
as
a
flanders
wagon
horse
from
a
spanish
jennet
but
thou
art
deceived
england
has
many
a
merchant
as
haughty
of
heart
and
as
prompt
of
hand
as
any
son
of
her
rich
bosom
but
be
not
dejected
thou
foolish
man
do
thy
business
well
on
this
merchant
and
we
shall
presently
have
on
our
hands
the
landamman
of
unterwalden
who
though
a
churl
by
his
choice
is
yet
a
nobleman
by
blood
and
shall
by
his
death
aid
thee
to
get
rid
of
the
peasant
slough
which
thou
art
so
weary
of
were
not
your
excellency
better
adjourn
these
men
fate
said
kilian
till
you
hear
something
of
them
from
the
swiss
prisoners
whom
we
shall
presently
have
in
our
power
be
it
as
you
will
said
hagenbach
waving
his
hand
as
if
putting
aside
some
disagreeable
task
but
let
all
be
finished
ere
i
hear
of
it
again
the
stern
satellites
bowed
obedience
and
the
deadly
conclave
broke
up
their
chief
carefully
securing
the
valuable
gems
which
he
was
willing
to
purchase
at
the
expense
of
treachery
to
the
sovereign
in
whose
employment
he
had
enlisted
himself
as
well
as
the
blood
of
two
innocent
men
yet
with
a
weakness
of
mind
not
uncommon
to
great
criminals
he
shrank
from
the
thoughts
of
his
own
baseness
and
cruelty
and
endeavoured
to
banish
the
feeling
of
dishonour
from
his
mind
by
devolving
the
immediate
execution
of
his
villany
upon
his
subordinate
agents
footnote
louis
xi
was
probably
the
first
king
of
france
who
flung
aside
all
affectation
of
choosing
his
ministers
from
among
the
nobility
he
often
placed
men
of
mean
birth
in
situations
of
the
highest
trust
chapter
xv
and
this
place
our
forefathers
built
for
man
the
dungeon
in
which
the
younger
philipson
was
immured
was
one
of
those
gloomy
caverns
which
cry
shame
on
the
inhumanity
of
our
ancestors
they
seem
to
have
been
almost
insensible
to
the
distinction
betwixt
innocence
and
guilt
as
the
consequences
of
mere
accusation
must
have
been
far
more
severe
in
those
days
than
is
in
our
own
that
species
of
imprisonment
which
is
adjudged
as
an
express
punishment
for
crime
the
cell
of
arthur
philipson
was
of
considerable
length
but
dark
and
narrow
and
dug
out
of
the
solid
rock
upon
which
the
tower
was
founded
a
small
lamp
was
allowed
him
not
however
without
some
grumbling
but
his
arms
were
still
kept
bound
and
when
he
asked
for
a
draught
of
water
one
of
the
grim
satellites
by
whom
he
was
thrust
into
this
cell
answered
surlily
that
he
might
endure
his
thirst
for
all
the
time
his
life
was
likely
to
last
a
gloomy
response
which
augured
that
his
privations
would
continue
as
long
as
his
life
yet
neither
be
of
long
duration
by
the
dim
lamp
he
had
groped
his
way
to
a
bench
or
rough
seat
cut
in
the
rock
and
as
his
eyes
got
gradually
accustomed
to
the
obscurity
of
the
region
in
which
he
was
immured
he
became
aware
of
a
ghastly
cleft
in
the
floor
of
his
dungeon
somewhat
resembling
the
opening
of
a
but
irregular
in
its
aperture
and
apparently
the
mouth
of
a
gulf
of
conformation
slightly
assisted
by
the
labour
of
human
art
here
then
is
my
he
said
and
that
gulf
perhaps
the
grave
which
yawns
for
my
remains
nay
i
have
heard
of
prisoners
being
plunged
into
such
horrid
abysses
while
they
were
yet
alive
to
die
at
leisure
crushed
with
wounds
their
groans
unheard
and
their
fate
unpitied
he
approached
his
head
to
the
dismal
cavity
and
heard
as
at
a
great
depth
the
sound
of
a
sullen
and
as
it
seemed
subterranean
stream
the
sunless
waves
appeared
murmuring
for
their
victim
death
is
dreadful
at
all
ages
but
in
the
first
springtide
of
youth
with
all
the
feelings
of
enjoyment
afloat
and
eager
for
gratification
to
be
snatched
forcibly
from
the
banquet
to
which
the
individual
has
but
just
sat
down
is
peculiarly
appalling
even
when
the
change
comes
in
the
ordinary
course
of
nature
but
to
sit
like
young
philipson
on
the
brink
of
the
subterranean
abyss
and
ruminate
in
horrid
doubt
concerning
the
mode
in
which
death
was
to
be
inflicted
was
a
situation
which
might
break
the
spirit
of
the
boldest
and
the
unfortunate
captive
was
wholly
unable
to
suppress
the
natural
tears
that
flowed
from
his
eyes
in
torrents
and
which
his
bound
arms
did
not
permit
him
to
wipe
away
we
have
already
noticed
that
although
a
gallant
young
man
in
aught
of
danger
which
was
to
be
faced
and
overcome
by
active
exertion
the
youth
was
strongly
imaginative
and
sensitive
to
a
powerful
extent
to
all
those
exaggerations
which
in
a
situation
of
helpless
uncertainty
fancy
lends
to
distract
the
soul
of
him
who
must
passively
expect
an
approaching
evil
yet
the
feelings
of
arthur
philipson
were
not
selfish
they
reverted
to
his
father
whose
just
and
noble
character
was
as
much
formed
to
attract
veneration
as
his
unceasing
paternal
care
and
affection
to
excite
love
and
gratitude
he
too
was
in
the
hands
of
remorseless
villains
who
were
determined
to
conceal
robbery
by
secret
murder
he
too
undaunted
in
so
many
dangers
resolute
in
so
many
encounters
lay
bound
and
defenceless
exposed
to
the
dagger
of
the
meanest
stabber
arthur
remembered
too
the
giddy
peak
of
the
rock
near
geierstein
and
the
grim
vulture
which
claimed
him
as
its
prey
here
was
no
angel
to
burst
through
the
mist
and
marshal
him
on
a
path
of
safety
here
the
darkness
was
subterranean
and
eternal
saving
when
the
captive
should
behold
the
knife
of
the
ruffian
flash
against
the
lamp
which
lent
him
light
to
aim
the
fatal
blow
this
agony
of
mind
lasted
until
the
feelings
of
the
unhappy
prisoner
arose
to
ecstasy
he
started
up
and
struggled
so
hard
to
free
himself
of
his
bonds
that
it
seemed
they
should
have
fallen
from
him
as
from
the
arms
of
the
mighty
nazarene
but
the
cords
were
of
too
firm
a
texture
and
after
a
violent
and
unavailing
struggle
in
which
the
ligatures
seemed
to
enter
his
flesh
the
prisoner
lost
his
balance
and
while
the
feeling
thrilled
through
him
that
he
was
tumbling
backward
into
the
subterranean
abyss
he
fell
to
the
ground
with
great
force
fortunately
he
escaped
the
danger
which
in
his
agony
he
apprehended
but
so
narrowly
that
his
head
struck
against
the
low
and
broken
fence
with
which
the
mouth
of
the
horrible
pit
was
partly
surrounded
here
he
lay
stunned
and
motionless
and
as
the
lamp
was
extinguished
in
his
fall
immersed
in
absolute
and
total
darkness
he
was
recalled
to
sensation
by
a
jarring
noise
they
come
they
come
the
murderers
oh
lady
of
mercy
and
oh
gracious
heaven
forgive
my
transgressions
he
looked
up
and
observed
with
dazzled
eyes
that
a
dark
form
approached
him
with
a
knife
in
one
hand
and
a
torch
in
the
other
he
might
well
have
seemed
the
man
who
was
to
do
the
last
deed
upon
the
unhappy
prisoner
if
he
had
come
alone
but
he
came
not
alone
his
torch
gleamed
upon
the
white
dress
of
a
female
which
was
so
much
illuminated
by
it
that
arthur
could
discover
a
form
and
had
even
a
glimpse
of
features
never
to
be
forgotten
though
now
seen
under
circumstances
least
of
all
to
be
expected
the
prisoner
unutterable
astonishment
impressed
him
with
a
degree
of
awe
which
overcame
even
his
personal
fear
can
these
things
be
was
his
muttered
reflection
has
she
really
the
power
of
an
elementary
spirit
has
she
conjured
up
this
earthlike
and
dark
demon
to
concur
with
her
in
my
deliverance
it
appeared
as
if
his
guess
were
real
for
the
figure
in
black
giving
the
light
to
anne
of
geierstein
or
at
least
the
form
which
bore
her
perfect
resemblance
stooped
over
the
prisoner
and
cut
the
cord
that
bound
his
arms
with
so
much
despatch
that
it
seemed
as
if
it
fell
from
his
person
at
a
touch
arthur
first
attempt
to
arise
was
unsuccessful
and
a
second
time
it
was
the
hand
of
anne
of
geierstein
a
living
hand
sensible
to
touch
as
to
sight
which
aided
to
raise
and
to
support
him
as
it
had
formerly
done
when
the
tormented
waters
of
the
river
thundered
at
their
feet
her
touch
produced
an
effect
far
beyond
that
of
the
slight
personal
aid
which
the
maiden
strength
could
have
rendered
courage
was
restored
to
his
heart
vigour
and
animation
to
his
benumbed
and
bruised
limbs
such
influence
does
the
human
mind
when
excited
to
energy
possess
over
the
infirmities
of
the
human
body
he
was
about
to
address
anne
in
accents
of
the
deepest
gratitude
but
the
accents
died
away
on
his
tongue
when
the
mysterious
female
laying
her
finger
on
her
lips
made
him
a
sign
to
be
silent
and
at
the
same
time
beckoned
him
to
follow
her
he
obeyed
in
silent
amazement
they
passed
the
entrance
of
the
melancholy
dungeon
and
through
one
or
two
short
but
intricate
passages
which
cut
out
of
the
rock
in
some
places
and
built
in
others
with
hewn
stone
of
the
same
kind
probably
led
to
holds
similar
to
that
in
which
arthur
was
so
lately
a
captive
the
recollection
that
his
father
might
be
immured
in
some
such
horrid
cell
as
he
himself
had
just
quitted
induced
arthur
to
pause
as
they
reached
the
bottom
of
a
small
winding
staircase
which
conducted
apparently
from
this
region
of
the
building
come
he
said
dearest
anne
lead
me
to
his
deliverance
i
must
not
leave
my
father
she
shook
her
head
impatiently
and
beckoned
him
on
if
your
power
extends
not
to
save
my
father
life
i
will
remain
and
save
him
or
die
anne
dearest
anne
she
answered
not
but
her
companion
replied
in
a
deep
voice
not
unsuitable
to
his
appearance
speak
young
man
to
those
who
are
permitted
to
answer
you
or
rather
be
silent
and
listen
to
my
instructions
which
direct
to
the
only
course
which
can
bring
thy
father
to
freedom
and
safety
they
ascended
the
stair
anne
of
geierstein
going
first
while
arthur
who
followed
close
behind
could
not
help
thinking
that
her
form
gave
existence
to
a
part
of
the
light
which
her
garment
reflected
from
the
torch
this
was
probably
the
effect
of
the
superstitious
belief
impressed
on
his
mind
by
rudolph
tale
respecting
her
mother
and
which
was
confirmed
by
her
sudden
appearance
in
a
place
and
situation
where
she
was
so
little
to
have
been
expected
he
had
not
much
time
however
to
speculate
upon
her
appearance
or
demeanour
for
mounting
the
stair
with
a
lighter
pace
than
he
was
able
at
the
time
to
follow
closely
she
was
no
longer
to
be
seen
when
he
reached
the
but
whether
she
had
melted
into
the
air
or
turned
aside
into
some
other
passage
he
was
not
permitted
a
moment
leisure
to
examine
here
lies
your
way
said
his
sable
guide
and
at
the
same
time
dashing
out
the
light
and
seizing
philipson
by
the
arm
he
led
him
along
a
dark
gallery
of
considerable
length
the
young
man
was
not
without
some
momentary
misgivings
while
he
recollected
the
ominous
looks
of
his
conductor
and
that
he
was
armed
with
a
dagger
or
knife
which
he
could
plunge
of
a
sudden
into
his
bosom
but
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
dread
treachery
from
any
one
whom
he
had
seen
in
company
with
anne
of
geierstein
and
in
his
heart
he
demanded
her
pardon
for
the
fear
which
had
flashed
across
him
and
resigned
himself
to
the
guidance
of
his
companion
who
advanced
with
hasty
but
light
footsteps
and
cautioned
him
by
a
whisper
to
do
the
same
our
journey
he
at
length
said
ends
here
as
he
spoke
a
door
gave
way
and
admitted
them
into
a
gloomy
gothic
apartment
furnished
with
large
oaken
presses
apparently
filled
with
books
and
manuscripts
as
arthur
looked
round
with
eyes
dazzled
with
the
sudden
gleam
of
daylight
from
which
he
had
been
for
some
time
excluded
the
door
by
which
they
had
entered
disappeared
this
however
did
not
greatly
surprise
him
who
judged
that
being
formed
in
appearance
to
correspond
with
the
presses
around
the
entrance
which
they
had
used
it
could
not
when
shut
be
distinguished
from
them
a
device
sometimes
then
practised
as
indeed
it
often
is
at
the
present
day
he
had
now
a
full
view
of
his
deliverer
who
when
seen
by
daylight
showed
only
the
vestments
and
features
of
a
clergyman
without
any
of
that
expression
of
supernatural
horror
which
the
partial
light
and
the
melancholy
appearance
of
all
in
the
dungeon
had
combined
to
impress
on
him
young
philipson
once
more
breathed
with
freedom
as
one
awakened
from
a
hideous
dream
and
the
supernatural
qualities
with
which
his
imagination
had
invested
anne
of
geierstein
having
begun
to
vanish
he
addressed
his
deliverer
thus
that
i
may
testify
my
thanks
holy
father
where
they
are
so
especially
due
let
me
inquire
of
you
if
anne
of
geierstein
speak
of
that
which
pertains
to
your
house
and
family
answered
the
priest
as
briefly
as
before
hast
thou
so
soon
forgot
thy
danger
by
heavens
no
replied
the
youth
tell
me
but
how
to
act
for
his
deliverance
and
thou
shalt
see
how
a
son
can
fight
for
a
parent
it
is
well
for
it
is
needful
said
the
priest
don
thou
this
vestment
and
follow
me
the
vestment
presented
was
the
gown
and
hood
of
a
novice
draw
the
cowl
over
thy
face
said
the
priest
and
return
no
answer
to
any
man
who
meets
thee
i
will
say
thou
art
under
a
may
heaven
forgive
the
unworthy
tyrant
who
imposes
on
us
the
necessity
of
such
profane
dissimulation
follow
me
close
and
near
beware
that
you
speak
not
the
business
of
disguise
was
soon
accomplished
and
the
priest
of
paul
for
such
he
was
moving
on
arthur
followed
him
a
pace
or
two
behind
assuming
as
well
as
he
could
the
modest
step
and
humble
demeanour
of
a
spiritual
novice
on
leaving
the
library
or
study
and
descending
a
short
stair
he
found
himself
in
the
street
of
brisach
irresistibly
tempted
to
look
back
he
had
only
time
however
to
see
that
the
house
he
had
left
was
a
very
small
building
of
a
gothic
character
on
the
one
side
of
which
rose
the
church
of
paul
and
on
the
other
the
stern
black
or
follow
me
melchior
said
the
deep
voice
of
the
priest
and
his
keen
eyes
were
at
the
same
time
fixed
upon
the
supposed
novice
with
a
look
which
instantly
recalled
arthur
to
a
sense
of
his
situation
they
passed
along
nobody
noticing
them
unless
to
greet
the
priest
with
a
silent
obeisance
or
muttered
phrase
of
salutation
until
having
nearly
gained
the
middle
of
the
village
the
guide
turned
abruptly
off
from
the
street
and
moving
northward
by
a
short
lane
reached
a
flight
of
steps
which
as
usual
in
fortified
towns
led
to
the
banquette
or
walk
behind
the
parapet
which
was
of
the
old
gothic
fashion
flanked
with
towers
from
space
to
space
of
different
forms
and
various
heights
at
different
angles
there
were
sentinels
on
the
walls
but
the
watch
as
it
seemed
was
kept
not
by
regular
soldiers
but
by
burghers
with
spears
or
swords
in
their
hands
the
first
whom
they
passed
said
to
the
priest
in
a
tone
holds
our
purpose
it
holds
replied
the
priest
of
st
benedicite
gratias
replied
the
armed
citizen
and
continued
his
walk
upon
the
battlements
the
other
sentinels
seemed
to
avoid
them
for
they
disappeared
when
they
came
near
or
passed
them
without
looking
or
seeming
to
observe
them
at
last
their
walk
brought
them
to
an
ancient
turret
which
raised
its
head
above
the
wall
and
in
which
there
was
a
small
door
opening
from
the
battlement
it
was
in
a
corner
distinct
from
and
uncommanded
by
any
of
the
angles
of
the
fortification
in
a
fortress
such
a
point
ought
to
have
had
a
sentinel
for
its
special
protection
but
no
one
was
there
upon
duty
now
mark
me
said
the
priest
for
your
father
life
and
it
may
be
that
of
many
a
man
besides
depends
upon
your
attention
and
no
less
upon
your
you
can
run
you
can
leap
i
feel
no
weariness
father
since
you
freed
me
answered
arthur
and
the
dun
deer
that
i
have
often
chased
shall
not
beat
me
in
such
a
wager
observe
then
replied
the
black
priest
of
paul
this
turret
contains
a
staircase
which
descends
to
a
small
sallyport
i
will
give
you
entrance
to
it
the
sallyport
is
barred
on
the
inside
but
not
locked
it
will
give
you
access
to
the
moat
which
is
almost
entirely
dry
on
crossing
it
you
will
find
yourself
in
the
circuit
of
the
outer
barriers
you
may
see
sentinels
but
they
will
not
see
you
speak
not
to
them
but
make
your
way
over
the
palisade
as
you
can
i
trust
you
can
climb
over
an
undefended
rampart
i
have
surmounted
a
defended
one
said
arthur
what
is
my
next
charge
all
this
is
easy
you
will
see
a
species
of
thicket
or
stretch
of
low
bushes
make
for
it
with
all
speed
when
you
are
there
turn
to
the
eastward
but
beware
while
holding
that
course
that
you
are
not
seen
by
the
burgundian
free
companions
who
are
on
watch
on
that
part
of
the
walls
a
volley
of
arrows
and
the
sally
of
a
body
of
cavalry
in
pursuit
will
be
the
consequence
if
they
get
sight
of
you
and
their
eyes
are
those
of
the
eagle
that
spy
the
carnage
afar
off
i
will
be
heedful
said
the
young
englishman
you
will
find
continued
the
priest
upon
the
outer
side
of
the
thicket
a
path
or
rather
a
which
sweeping
at
some
distance
from
the
walls
will
conduct
you
at
last
into
the
road
leading
from
brisach
to
bâle
hasten
forward
to
meet
the
swiss
who
are
advancing
tell
them
your
father
hours
are
counted
and
that
they
must
press
on
if
they
would
save
him
and
say
to
rudolph
donnerhugel
in
especial
that
the
black
priest
of
paul
waits
to
bestow
upon
him
his
blessing
at
the
northern
sallyport
dost
thou
understand
me
perfectly
answered
the
young
man
the
priest
of
paul
then
pushed
open
the
gate
of
the
turret
and
arthur
was
about
to
precipitate
himself
down
the
stair
which
opened
before
him
stay
yet
a
moment
said
the
priest
and
doff
the
novice
habit
which
can
only
encumber
thee
arthur
in
a
trice
threw
it
from
him
and
was
again
about
to
start
stay
yet
a
moment
longer
continued
the
black
priest
this
gown
may
be
a
stay
therefore
and
help
me
to
pull
off
my
upper
garment
inwardly
glowing
with
impatience
arthur
yet
saw
the
necessity
of
obeying
his
guide
and
when
he
had
pulled
the
long
and
loose
upper
vestment
from
the
old
man
he
stood
before
him
in
a
cassock
of
black
serge
befitting
his
order
and
profession
but
begirt
not
with
a
suitable
sash
such
as
clergymen
wear
but
with
a
most
uncanonical
supporting
a
short
sword
calculated
alike
to
stab
and
to
smite
give
me
now
the
novice
habit
said
the
venerable
father
and
over
that
i
will
put
the
priestly
vestment
since
for
the
present
i
have
some
tokens
of
the
laity
about
me
it
is
fitting
it
should
be
covered
with
a
double
portion
of
the
clerical
habit
as
he
spoke
thus
he
smiled
grimly
and
his
smile
had
something
more
frightful
and
withering
than
the
stern
frown
which
suited
better
with
his
features
and
was
their
usual
expression
and
now
said
he
what
does
the
fool
tarry
for
when
life
and
death
are
in
his
speed
the
young
messenger
waited
not
a
second
hint
but
at
once
descended
the
stairs
as
if
it
had
been
by
a
single
step
found
the
portal
as
the
priest
had
said
only
secured
by
bars
on
the
inside
offering
little
resistance
save
from
their
rusted
state
which
made
it
difficult
to
draw
them
arthur
succeeded
however
and
found
himself
at
the
side
of
the
moat
which
presented
a
green
and
marshy
appearance
without
stopping
to
examine
whether
it
was
deep
or
shallow
and
almost
without
being
sensible
of
the
tenacity
of
the
morass
the
young
englishman
forced
his
way
through
it
and
attained
the
opposite
side
without
attracting
the
attention
of
two
worthy
burghers
of
brisach
who
were
the
guardians
of
the
barriers
one
of
them
indeed
was
deeply
employed
in
the
perusal
of
some
profane
chronicle
or
religious
legend
the
other
was
as
anxiously
engaged
in
examining
the
margin
of
the
moat
in
search
of
eels
perhaps
or
frogs
for
he
wore
over
his
shoulder
a
scrip
for
securing
some
such
amphibious
booty
seeing
that
as
the
priest
foretold
he
had
nothing
to
apprehend
from
the
vigilance
of
the
sentinels
arthur
dashed
at
the
palisade
in
hope
to
catch
hold
of
the
top
of
the
stockade
and
so
to
clear
it
by
one
bold
leap
he
overrated
his
powers
of
activity
however
or
they
were
diminished
by
his
recent
bonds
and
imprisonment
he
fell
lightly
backward
on
the
ground
and
as
he
got
to
his
feet
became
aware
of
the
presence
of
a
soldier
in
yellow
and
blue
the
livery
of
de
hagenbach
who
came
running
towards
him
crying
to
the
slothful
and
unobservant
sentinels
alarm
alarm
you
lazy
swine
stop
the
dog
or
you
are
both
dead
men
the
fisherman
who
was
on
the
farther
side
laid
down
his
drew
his
sword
and
flourishing
it
over
his
head
advanced
towards
philipson
with
very
moderate
haste
the
student
was
yet
more
unfortunate
for
in
his
hurry
to
fold
up
his
book
and
attend
to
his
duty
he
contrived
to
throw
himself
inadvertently
doubtless
full
in
the
soldier
way
the
latter
who
was
running
at
top
speed
encountered
the
burgher
with
a
severe
shock
which
threw
both
down
but
the
citizen
being
a
solid
and
substantial
man
lay
still
where
he
fell
while
the
other
less
weighty
and
probably
less
prepared
for
the
collision
lost
his
balance
and
the
command
of
his
limbs
at
once
and
rolling
over
the
edge
of
the
moat
was
immersed
in
the
mud
and
marsh
the
fisher
and
the
student
went
with
deliberate
speed
to
assist
the
unexpected
and
unwelcome
partner
of
their
watch
while
arthur
stimulated
by
the
imminent
sense
of
danger
sprang
at
the
barrier
with
more
address
and
vigour
than
before
and
succeeding
in
his
leap
made
as
he
had
been
directed
with
his
utmost
speed
for
the
covert
of
the
adjacent
bushes
he
reached
them
without
hearing
any
alarm
from
the
walls
but
he
was
conscious
that
his
situation
had
become
extremely
precarious
since
his
escape
from
the
town
was
known
to
one
man
at
least
who
would
not
fail
to
give
the
alarm
in
case
he
was
able
to
extricate
himself
from
the
marsh
a
feat
however
in
which
it
seemed
to
arthur
that
the
armed
citizens
were
likely
to
prove
rather
his
apparent
than
actual
assistants
while
such
thoughts
shot
across
his
mind
they
served
to
augment
his
natural
speed
of
foot
so
that
in
less
space
than
could
have
been
thought
possible
he
reached
the
thinner
extremity
of
the
thicket
whence
as
intimated
by
the
black
priest
he
could
see
the
eastern
tower
and
the
adjoining
battlements
of
the
town
with
hostile
faces
throng
and
fiery
arms
it
required
at
the
same
time
some
address
on
the
part
of
the
fugitive
to
keep
so
much
under
shelter
as
to
prevent
himself
from
being
seen
in
his
turn
by
those
whom
he
saw
so
plainly
he
therefore
expected
every
moment
to
hear
a
bugle
wind
or
to
behold
that
bustle
and
commotion
among
the
defenders
which
might
prognosticate
a
sally
neither
however
took
place
and
heedfully
observing
the
footpath
or
track
which
the
priest
had
pointed
out
to
him
young
philipson
wheeled
his
course
out
of
sight
of
the
guarded
towers
and
soon
falling
into
the
public
and
frequented
road
by
which
his
father
and
he
had
approached
the
town
in
the
morning
he
had
the
happiness
by
the
dust
and
flash
of
arms
to
see
a
small
body
of
armed
men
advancing
towards
brisach
whom
he
justly
concluded
to
be
the
van
of
the
swiss
deputation
he
soon
met
the
party
which
consisted
of
about
ten
men
with
rudolph
donnerhugel
at
their
head
the
figure
of
philipson
covered
with
mud
and
in
some
places
stained
with
blood
for
his
fall
in
the
dungeon
had
cost
him
a
slight
wound
attracted
the
wonder
of
every
one
who
crowded
around
to
hear
the
news
rudolph
alone
appeared
unmoved
like
the
visage
on
the
ancient
statues
of
hercules
the
physiognomy
of
the
bulky
bernese
was
large
and
massive
having
an
air
of
indifferent
and
almost
sullen
composure
which
did
not
change
but
in
moments
of
the
fiercest
agitation
he
listened
without
emotion
to
the
breathless
tale
of
arthur
philipson
that
his
father
was
in
prison
and
adjudged
to
death
and
what
else
did
you
expect
said
the
bernese
coldly
were
you
not
warned
it
had
been
easy
to
have
foreseen
the
misfortune
but
it
may
be
impossible
to
prevent
it
i
own
i
own
said
arthur
wringing
his
hands
that
you
were
wise
and
that
we
were
but
oh
do
not
think
of
our
folly
in
the
moment
of
our
extremity
be
the
gallant
and
generous
champion
which
your
cantons
proclaim
you
give
us
your
aid
in
this
deadly
strait
but
how
or
in
what
manner
said
rudolph
still
hesitating
we
have
dismissed
the
bâlese
who
were
willing
to
have
given
assistance
so
much
did
your
dutiful
example
weigh
with
us
we
are
now
scarce
above
a
score
of
men
how
can
you
ask
us
to
attack
a
garrison
town
secured
by
fortifications
and
where
there
are
six
times
our
number
you
have
friends
within
the
fortifications
replied
arthur
i
am
sure
you
have
hark
in
your
ear
the
black
priest
sent
to
you
to
you
rudolph
donnerhugel
of
berne
that
he
waits
to
give
you
his
blessing
at
the
northern
sallyport
ay
doubtless
said
rudolph
shaking
himself
free
of
attempt
to
engage
him
in
private
conference
and
speaking
so
that
all
around
might
hear
him
there
is
little
doubt
o
i
will
find
a
priest
at
the
northern
sallyport
to
confess
and
absolve
me
and
a
block
axe
and
headsman
to
strike
my
throat
asunder
when
he
has
done
but
i
will
scarce
put
the
neck
of
my
father
son
into
such
risk
if
they
assassinate
an
english
pedlar
who
has
never
offended
them
what
will
they
do
with
the
bear
of
berne
whose
fangs
and
talons
archibald
de
hagenbach
has
felt
ere
now
young
philipson
at
these
words
clasped
his
hands
together
and
held
them
up
to
heaven
as
one
who
abandons
hope
excepting
thence
the
tears
started
to
his
eyes
and
clenching
his
hands
and
setting
his
teeth
he
turned
his
back
abruptly
upon
the
swiss
what
means
this
passion
said
rudolph
whither
would
you
now
to
rescue
my
father
or
perish
with
him
said
arthur
and
was
about
to
run
wildly
back
to
la
ferette
when
a
strong
but
kindly
grasp
detained
him
tarry
a
little
till
i
tie
my
garter
said
sigismund
biederman
and
i
will
go
with
you
king
arthur
you
oaf
exclaimed
rudolph
you
and
without
orders
why
look
you
cousin
rudolph
said
the
youth
continuing
with
great
composure
to
fasten
his
garter
which
after
the
fashion
of
the
time
was
somewhat
intricately
secured
you
are
always
telling
us
that
we
are
swiss
and
freemen
and
what
is
the
advantage
of
being
a
freeman
if
one
is
not
at
liberty
to
do
what
he
has
a
mind
you
are
my
hauptman
look
you
so
long
as
it
pleases
me
and
no
longer
and
why
shouldst
thou
desert
me
now
thou
fool
why
at
this
minute
of
all
other
minutes
in
the
year
demanded
the
bernese
look
you
replied
the
insubordinate
follower
i
have
hunted
with
arthur
for
this
month
past
and
i
love
him
he
never
called
me
fool
or
idiot
because
my
thoughts
came
slower
maybe
and
something
duller
than
those
of
other
folk
and
i
love
his
father
the
old
man
gave
me
this
baldrick
and
this
horn
which
i
warrant
cost
many
a
kreutzer
he
told
me
too
not
to
be
discouraged
for
that
it
was
better
to
think
justly
than
to
think
fast
and
that
i
had
sense
enough
for
the
one
if
not
for
the
other
and
the
kind
old
man
is
now
in
but
we
will
free
him
arthur
if
two
men
may
thou
shalt
see
me
fight
while
steel
blade
and
ashen
shaft
will
hold
together
so
saying
he
shook
in
the
air
his
enormous
partisan
which
quivered
in
his
grasp
like
a
slip
of
willow
indeed
if
iniquity
was
to
be
struck
down
like
an
ox
there
was
not
one
in
that
chosen
band
more
likely
to
perform
the
feat
than
sigismund
for
though
somewhat
shorter
in
stature
than
his
brethren
and
of
a
less
animated
spirit
yet
his
breadth
of
shoulders
and
strength
of
muscles
were
enormous
and
if
thoroughly
aroused
and
disposed
for
the
contest
which
was
very
rarely
the
case
perhaps
rudolph
himself
might
as
far
as
sheer
force
went
have
had
difficulty
in
matching
him
truth
of
sentiment
and
energy
of
expression
always
produce
an
effect
on
natural
and
generous
characters
several
of
the
youths
around
began
to
exclaim
that
sigismund
said
well
that
if
the
old
man
had
put
himself
in
danger
it
was
because
he
thought
more
of
the
success
of
their
negotiation
than
of
his
own
safety
and
had
taken
himself
from
under
their
protection
rather
than
involve
them
in
quarrels
on
his
account
we
are
the
more
bound
they
said
to
see
him
unscathed
and
we
will
do
so
peace
all
you
wiseacres
said
rudolph
looking
round
with
an
air
of
superiority
and
you
arthur
of
england
pass
on
to
the
landamman
who
is
close
behind
you
know
he
is
our
chief
commander
he
is
no
less
your
father
sincere
friend
and
whatever
he
may
determine
in
your
father
favour
you
will
find
most
ready
executors
of
his
pleasure
in
all
of
us
his
companions
appeared
to
concur
in
this
advice
and
young
philipson
saw
that
his
own
compliance
with
the
recommendation
was
indispensable
indeed
although
he
still
suspected
that
the
bernese
by
his
various
intrigues
as
well
with
the
swiss
youth
as
with
those
of
bâle
and
as
might
be
inferred
from
the
priest
of
paul
by
communication
even
within
the
town
of
la
ferette
possessed
the
greater
power
of
assisting
him
at
such
a
conjuncture
yet
he
trusted
far
more
in
the
simple
candour
and
perfect
faith
of
arnold
biederman
and
pressed
forward
to
tell
to
him
his
mournful
tale
and
crave
his
assistance
from
the
top
of
a
bank
which
he
reached
in
a
few
minutes
after
he
parted
from
rudolph
and
the
advanced
guard
he
saw
beneath
him
the
venerable
landamman
and
his
associates
attended
by
a
few
of
the
youths
who
no
longer
were
dispersed
upon
the
flanks
of
the
party
but
attended
on
them
closely
and
in
military
array
as
men
prepared
to
repel
any
sudden
attack
behind
came
a
mule
or
two
with
baggage
together
with
the
animals
which
in
the
ordinary
course
of
their
march
supported
anne
of
geierstein
and
her
attendant
both
were
occupied
by
female
figures
as
usual
and
to
the
best
of
arthur
ken
the
foremost
had
the
dress
of
anne
from
the
grey
mantle
to
a
small
plume
which
since
entering
germany
she
had
worn
in
compliance
with
the
custom
of
the
country
and
in
evidence
of
her
rank
as
a
maiden
of
birth
and
distinction
yet
if
the
youth
eyes
brought
him
true
tidings
at
present
what
was
the
character
of
their
former
information
when
scarce
more
than
half
an
hour
since
they
had
beheld
in
the
subterranean
dungeon
of
brisach
the
same
form
which
they
now
rested
upon
in
circumstances
so
very
different
the
feeling
excited
by
this
thought
was
powerful
but
it
was
momentary
like
the
lightning
which
blazes
through
a
midnight
sky
which
is
but
just
seen
ere
it
vanishes
into
darkness
or
rather
the
wonder
excited
by
this
marvellous
incident
only
maintained
its
ground
in
his
thoughts
by
allying
itself
with
the
anxiety
for
his
father
safety
which
was
their
predominant
occupation
if
there
be
indeed
a
spirit
he
said
which
wears
that
beautiful
form
it
must
be
beneficent
as
well
as
lovely
and
will
extend
to
my
far
more
deserving
father
the
protection
which
his
son
has
twice
experienced
but
ere
he
had
time
to
prosecute
such
a
thought
further
he
had
met
the
landamman
and
his
party
here
his
appearance
and
his
condition
excited
the
same
surprise
as
they
had
formerly
occasioned
to
rudolph
and
the
vanguard
to
the
repeated
interrogatories
of
the
landamman
he
gave
a
brief
account
of
his
own
imprisonment
and
of
his
escape
of
which
he
suffered
the
whole
glory
to
rest
with
the
black
priest
of
paul
without
mentioning
one
word
of
the
more
interesting
female
apparition
by
which
he
had
been
attended
and
assisted
in
his
charitable
task
on
another
point
also
arthur
was
silent
he
saw
no
propriety
in
communicating
to
arnold
biederman
the
message
which
the
priest
had
addressed
to
rudolph
ear
alone
whether
good
should
come
of
it
or
no
he
held
sacred
the
obligation
of
silence
imposed
upon
him
by
a
man
from
whom
he
had
just
received
the
most
important
assistance
the
landamman
was
struck
dumb
for
a
moment
with
sorrow
and
surprise
at
the
news
which
he
heard
the
elder
philipson
had
gained
his
respect
as
well
by
the
purity
and
steadiness
of
the
principles
which
he
expressed
as
by
the
extent
and
depth
of
his
information
which
was
peculiarly
valuable
and
interesting
to
the
switzer
who
felt
his
admirable
judgment
considerably
fettered
for
want
of
that
knowledge
of
countries
times
and
manners
with
which
his
english
friend
often
supplied
him
let
us
press
forward
he
said
to
the
banneret
of
berne
and
the
other
deputies
let
us
offer
our
mediation
betwixt
the
tyrant
de
hagenbach
and
our
friend
whose
life
is
in
danger
he
must
listen
to
us
for
i
know
his
master
expects
to
see
this
philipson
at
his
court
the
old
man
hinted
to
me
so
much
as
we
are
possessed
of
such
a
secret
archibald
de
hagenbach
will
not
dare
to
brave
our
vengeance
since
we
might
easily
send
to
duke
charles
information
how
the
governor
of
la
ferette
abuses
his
power
in
matters
where
not
only
the
swiss
but
where
the
duke
himself
is
concerned
under
your
reverend
favour
my
worthy
sir
answered
the
banneret
of
berne
we
are
swiss
deputies
and
go
to
represent
the
injuries
of
switzerland
alone
if
we
embroil
ourselves
with
the
quarrels
of
strangers
we
shall
find
it
more
difficult
to
settle
advantageously
those
of
our
own
country
and
if
the
duke
should
by
this
villany
done
upon
english
merchants
bring
upon
him
the
resentment
of
the
english
monarch
such
breach
will
only
render
it
more
a
matter
of
peremptory
necessity
for
him
to
make
a
treaty
advantageous
to
the
swiss
cantons
there
was
so
much
worldly
policy
in
this
advice
that
adam
zimmerman
of
soleure
instantly
expressed
his
assent
with
the
additional
argument
that
their
brother
biederman
had
told
them
scarce
two
hours
before
how
these
english
merchants
had
by
his
advice
and
their
own
free
desire
parted
company
with
them
that
morning
on
purpose
that
they
might
not
involve
the
deputies
in
the
quarrels
which
might
be
raised
by
the
governor
exactions
on
his
merchandise
now
what
advantage
he
said
shall
we
derive
from
this
same
parting
of
company
supposing
as
my
brother
seems
to
urge
we
are
still
to
consider
this
englishman
interest
as
if
he
were
our
and
under
our
especial
protection
this
personal
reasoning
pinched
the
landamman
somewhat
closely
for
he
had
but
a
short
while
before
descanted
on
the
generosity
of
the
elder
philipson
who
had
freely
exposed
himself
to
danger
rather
than
that
he
should
embarrass
their
negotiation
by
remaining
one
of
their
company
and
it
completely
shook
the
fealty
of
the
nicholas
bonstetten
whose
eyes
wandered
from
the
face
of
zimmerman
which
expressed
triumphant
confidence
in
his
argument
to
that
of
his
friend
the
landamman
which
was
rather
more
embarrassed
than
usual
brethren
said
arnold
at
length
with
firmness
and
animation
i
erred
in
priding
myself
upon
the
worldly
policy
which
i
taught
to
you
this
morning
this
man
is
not
of
our
country
doubtless
but
he
is
of
our
blood
a
copy
of
the
common
creator
image
and
the
more
worthy
of
being
called
so
as
he
is
a
man
of
integrity
and
worth
we
might
not
without
grievous
sin
pass
such
a
person
being
in
danger
without
affording
him
relief
even
if
he
lay
accidentally
by
the
side
of
our
path
much
less
should
we
abandon
him
if
the
danger
has
been
incurred
in
our
own
cause
and
that
we
might
escape
the
net
in
which
he
is
himself
caught
be
not
therefore
downcast
we
do
god
will
in
succouring
an
oppressed
man
if
we
succeed
by
mild
means
as
i
trust
we
shall
we
do
a
good
action
at
a
cheap
rate
if
not
god
can
assert
the
cause
of
humanity
by
the
hands
of
few
as
well
as
of
many
if
such
is
your
opinion
said
the
bannerman
of
berne
not
a
man
here
will
shrink
from
you
for
me
i
pleaded
against
my
own
inclinations
when
i
advised
you
to
avoid
a
breach
with
the
burgundian
but
as
a
soldier
i
must
needs
say
i
would
rather
fight
the
garrison
were
they
double
the
number
they
talk
of
in
a
fair
field
than
undertake
to
storm
their
defences
nay
said
the
landamman
i
sincerely
hope
we
shall
both
enter
and
depart
from
the
town
of
brisach
without
deviating
from
the
pacific
character
with
which
our
mission
from
the
diet
invests
us
chapter
xvi
for
somerset
off
with
his
guilty
head
part
of
henry
the
governor
of
la
ferette
stood
on
the
battlements
of
the
eastern
of
his
fortress
and
looked
out
on
the
road
to
bâle
when
first
the
vanguard
of
the
swiss
mission
then
the
centre
and
rear
appeared
in
the
distance
at
the
same
moment
the
van
halting
the
main
body
closed
with
it
while
the
females
and
baggage
and
mules
in
the
rear
moved
in
their
turn
up
to
the
main
body
and
the
whole
were
united
in
one
group
a
messenger
then
stepped
forth
and
winded
one
of
those
tremendous
horns
the
spoils
of
the
so
numerous
in
the
canton
of
uri
that
they
are
supposed
to
have
given
rise
to
its
name
they
demand
admittance
said
the
esquire
they
shall
have
it
answered
sir
archibald
de
hagenbach
marry
how
they
may
pass
out
again
is
another
and
a
deeper
question
think
yet
a
moment
noble
sir
continued
the
esquire
bethink
you
these
switzers
are
very
fiends
in
fight
and
have
besides
no
booty
to
repay
the
conquest
some
paltry
chains
of
good
copper
perchance
or
adulterated
silver
you
have
knocked
out
the
marrow
do
not
damage
your
teeth
by
trying
to
grind
the
bone
thou
art
a
fool
kilian
answered
de
hagenbach
and
it
may
be
a
coward
besides
the
approach
of
some
score
or
at
most
some
score
and
a
half
of
swiss
partisans
makes
thee
draw
in
thy
horns
like
a
snail
at
a
child
finger
mine
are
strong
and
inflexible
as
those
of
the
urus
of
whom
they
talk
so
much
and
on
which
they
blow
so
boldly
keep
in
mind
thou
timid
creature
that
if
the
swiss
deputies
as
they
presume
to
call
themselves
are
permitted
to
pass
free
they
carry
to
the
duke
stories
of
merchants
bound
to
his
court
and
fraught
with
precious
commodities
specially
addressed
to
his
grace
charles
has
then
at
once
to
endure
the
presence
of
the
ambassadors
whom
he
contemns
and
hates
and
learns
by
them
that
the
governor
of
la
ferette
permitting
such
to
pass
has
nevertheless
presumed
to
stop
those
whom
he
would
full
gladly
see
for
what
prince
would
not
blithely
welcome
such
a
casket
as
that
which
we
have
taken
from
yonder
strolling
english
pedlar
i
see
not
how
the
assault
on
these
ambassadors
will
mend
your
excellency
plea
for
despoiling
the
englishmen
said
kilian
because
thou
art

kilian
answered
his
chief
if
burgundy
hears
of
a
ruffle
between
my
garrison
and
the
mountain
churls
whom
he
scorns
and
yet
hates
it
will
drown
all
notice
of
the
two
pedlars
who
have
perished
in
the
fray
if
should
come
an
hour
ride
transports
me
with
my
confidants
into
the
imperial
dominions
where
though
the
emperor
be
a
spiritless
fool
the
rich
prize
i
have
found
on
these
islanders
will
ensure
me
a
good
reception
i
will
stick
by
your
excellency
to
the
last
returned
the
esquire
and
you
shall
yourself
witness
that
if
a
fool
i
am
at
least
no
coward
i
never
thought
thee
such
when
it
came
to
said
de
hagenbach
but
in
policy
thou
art
timid
and
irresolute
hand
me
mine
armour
kilian
and
beware
thou
brace
it
well
the
swiss
pikes
and
swords
are
no
may
your
excellency
wear
it
with
honour
and
profit
said
kilian
and
according
to
the
duty
of
his
office
he
buckled
upon
his
principal
the
complete
panoply
of
a
knight
of
the
empire
your
purpose
of
assaulting
the
swiss
then
holds
firm
said
kilian
but
what
pretext
will
your
excellency
assign
let
me
alone
said
archibald
de
hagenbach
to
take
one
or
to
make
one
do
you
only
have
schonfeldt
and
the
soldiers
on
their
stations
and
remember
the
words
are
to
the
rescue
when
these
words
are
first
spoken
let
the
soldiers
show
themselves
when
repeated
let
them
fall
on
and
now
that
i
am
accoutred
away
to
the
churls
and
admit
them
kilian
bowed
and
withdrew
the
bugle
of
the
switzers
had
repeatedly
emitted
its
angry
roar
exasperated
by
the
delay
of
nearly
half
an
hour
without
an
answer
from
the
guarded
gate
of
brisach
and
every
blast
declared
by
the
prolonged
echoes
which
it
awakened
the
increased
impatience
of
those
who
summoned
the
town
at
length
the
portcullis
arose
the
gate
opened
the
drawbridge
fell
and
kilian
in
the
equipage
of
a
arrayed
for
fight
rode
forth
on
an
ambling
palfrey
what
bold
men
are
ye
sirs
who
are
here
in
arms
before
the
fortress
of
brisach
appertaining
in
right
and
seignorie
to
the
thrice
noble
duke
of
burgundy
and
lorraine
and
garrisoned
for
his
cause
and
interest
by
the
excellent
sir
archibald
lord
of
hagenbach
knight
of
the
most
holy
roman
empire
so
please
you
sir
esquire
said
the
landamman
for
such
i
conjecture
you
to
be
by
the
feather
in
your
bonnet
we
are
here
with
no
hostile
intentions
though
armed
as
you
see
to
defend
us
in
a
perilous
journey
where
we
are
something
unsafe
by
day
and
can
not
always
repose
by
night
in
places
of
security
but
our
arms
have
no
offensive
purpose
if
they
had
such
our
numbers
had
not
been
so
few
as
you
see
them
what
then
is
your
character
and
purpose
said
kilian
who
had
learned
to
use
in
his
master
absence
the
lordly
and
insolent
tone
of
the
governor
himself
we
are
delegates
answered
the
landamman
in
a
calm
and
even
tone
of
voice
without
appearing
to
take
offence
at
or
to
observe
the
insolent
demeanour
of
the
esquire
from
the
free
and
confederated
cantons
of
the
swiss
states
and
provinces
and
from
the
good
town
of
soleure
who
are
accredited
from
our
diet
of
legislature
to
travel
to
the
presence
of
his
grace
the
duke
of
burgundy
on
an
errand
of
high
importance
to
both
countries
and
with
the
hope
of
establishing
with
your
master
lord
i
mean
with
the
noble
duke
of
burgundy
a
sure
and
steadfast
peace
upon
such
terms
as
shall
be
to
the
mutual
honour
and
advantage
of
both
countries
and
to
avert
disputes
and
the
effusion
of
christian
blood
which
may
otherwise
be
shed
for
want
of
timely
and
good
understanding
show
me
your
letters
of
credence
said
the
esquire
under
your
forgiveness
sir
esquire
replied
the
landamman
it
will
be
time
enough
to
exhibit
these
when
we
are
admitted
to
the
presence
of
your
master
the
governor
that
is
as
much
as
to
say
wilful
will
to
it
it
is
well
my
masters
and
yet
you
may
take
this
advice
from
kilian
of
kersberg
it
is
sometimes
better
to
reel
backwards
than
to
run
my
master
and
my
master
master
are
more
ticklish
persons
than
the
dealers
of
bâle
to
whom
you
sell
your
cheeses
home
honest
men
home
your
way
lies
before
you
and
you
are
fairly
warned
we
thank
thee
for
thy
counsel
said
the
landamman
interrupting
the
banneret
of
berne
who
had
commenced
an
angry
reply
supposing
it
kindly
meant
if
not
an
uncivil
jest
is
like
an
overcharged
gun
which
recoils
on
the
cannoneer
our
road
lies
onward
through
brisach
and
onward
we
propose
to
go
and
take
such
hap
as
that
which
we
may
find
before
us
go
onward
then
in
the
devil
name
said
the
squire
who
had
entertained
some
hope
of
deterring
them
from
pursuing
their
journey
but
found
himself
effectually
foiled
the
switzers
entered
the
town
and
stopped
by
the
barricade
of
cars
which
the
governor
had
formed
across
the
street
at
about
twenty
yards
from
the
gate
they
drew
themselves
up
in
military
order
with
their
little
body
formed
into
three
lines
the
two
females
and
the
fathers
of
the
deputation
being
in
the
centre
the
little
phalanx
presented
a
double
front
one
to
each
side
of
the
street
while
the
centre
line
faced
so
as
to
move
forward
and
only
waited
for
the
removal
of
the
barricade
in
order
to
do
so
but
while
they
stood
thus
inactive
a
knight
in
complete
armour
appeared
from
a
side
door
of
the
great
tower
under
the
arch
of
which
they
had
entered
into
the
town
his
visor
was
raised
and
he
walked
along
the
front
of
the
little
line
formed
by
the
swiss
with
a
stern
and
frowning
aspect
who
are
you
he
said
who
have
thus
far
intruded
yourselves
in
arms
into
a
burgundian
garrison
with
your
excellency
leave
said
the
landamman
we
are
men
who
come
on
a
peaceful
errand
though
we
carry
arms
for
our
own
defence
deputies
we
are
from
the
towns
of
berne
and
soleure
the
cantons
of
uri
schwitz
and
unterwalden
come
to
adjust
matters
of
importance
with
the
gracious
duke
of
burgundy
and
lorraine
what
towns
what
cantons
said
the
governor
of
la
ferette
i
have
heard
no
such
names
among
the
free
cities
of
berne
truly
when
became
berne
a
free
state
since
the
day
of
june
said
arnold
biederman
in
the
year
of
grace
one
thousand
three
hundred
and
on
which
day
the
battle
of
laupen
was
fought
away
vain
old
man
said
the
knight
thinkest
thou
that
such
idle
boasts
can
avail
thee
here
we
have
heard
indeed
of
some
insurgent
villages
and
communities
among
the
alps
and
how
they
rebelled
against
the
emperor
and
by
the
advantage
of
fastnesses
ambuscades
and
how
they
have
murdered
some
knights
and
gentlemen
sent
against
them
by
the
duke
of
austria
but
we
little
thought
that
such
paltry
townships
and
insignificant
bands
of
mutineers
had
the
insolence
to
term
themselves
free
states
and
propose
to
enter
into
negotiation
as
such
with
a
mighty
prince
like
charles
of
burgundy
may
it
please
your
excellency
replied
the
landamman
with
perfect
temper
your
own
laws
of
chivalry
declare
that
if
the
stronger
wrong
the
weaker
or
the
noble
does
injury
to
the
less
gentle
the
very
act
levels
distinctions
between
them
and
the
doer
of
an
injury
becomes
bound
to
give
condign
satisfaction
of
such
kind
as
the
wronged
party
shall
demand
hence
to
thy
hills
churl
exclaimed
the
haughty
knight
there
comb
thy
beard
and
roast
thy
chestnuts
what
because
a
few
rats
and
mice
find
retreat
among
the
walls
and
wainscoting
of
our
shall
we
therefore
allow
them
to
intrude
their
disgusting
presence
and
their
airs
of
freedom
and
independence
into
our
personal
presence
no
we
will
rather
crush
them
beneath
the
heel
of
our
ironshod
boots
we
are
not
men
to
be
trodden
on
said
arnold
biederman
calmly
those
who
have
attempted
it
have
found
us
lay
sir
knight
lay
aside
for
an
instant
this
haughty
language
which
can
only
lead
to
warfare
and
listen
to
the
words
of
peace
dismiss
our
comrade
the
english
merchant
philipson
on
whom
you
have
this
morning
laid
unlawful
hands
let
him
pay
a
moderate
sum
for
his
ransom
and
we
who
are
bound
instantly
to
the
duke
presence
will
bear
a
fair
report
to
him
of
his
governor
of
la
ferette
you
will
be
so
generous
will
you
said
sir
archibald
in
a
tone
of
ridicule
and
what
pledge
shall
i
have
that
you
will
favour
me
so
kindly
as
you
propose
the
word
of
a
man
who
never
broke
his
promise
answered
the
stoical
landamman
insolent
hind
replied
the
knight
dost
thou
stipulate
offer
thy
paltry
word
as
a
pledge
betwixt
the
duke
of
burgundy
and
archibald
de
hagenbach
know
that
ye
go
not
to
burgundy
at
all
or
you
go
thither
with
fetters
on
your
hands
and
halters
round
your
so
ho
burgundy
to
the
rescue
instantly
as
he
spoke
the
soldiers
showed
themselves
before
behind
and
around
the
narrow
space
where
the
swiss
had
drawn
themselves
up
the
battlements
of
the
town
were
lined
with
men
others
presented
themselves
at
the
doors
of
each
house
in
the
street
prepared
to
sally
and
at
the
windows
prepared
to
shoot
as
well
with
guns
as
with
bows
and
crossbows
the
soldiers
who
defended
the
barricade
also
started
up
and
seemed
ready
to
dispute
the
passage
in
front
the
little
band
encompassed
and
overmatched
but
neither
startled
nor
disheartened
stood
to
their
arms
the
centre
rank
under
the
landamman
prepared
to
force
their
way
over
the
barricade
the
two
fronts
stood
back
to
back
ready
to
dispute
the
street
with
those
that
should
issue
from
the
houses
it
could
not
fail
to
prove
a
work
of
no
small
blood
and
toil
to
subdue
this
handful
of
determined
men
even
with
five
times
their
number
some
sense
of
this
perhaps
made
sir
archibald
delay
giving
the
signal
for
onset
when
suddenly
behind
arose
a
cry
of
treason
treason
a
soldier
covered
with
mud
rushed
before
the
governor
and
said
in
hurried
accents
that
as
he
endeavoured
to
stop
a
prisoner
who
had
made
his
escape
some
short
time
since
he
had
been
seized
by
the
burghers
of
the
town
and
drowned
in
the
moat
he
added
that
the
citizens
were
even
now
admitting
the
enemy
into
the
place
kilian
said
the
knight
take
two
score
of
men
hasten
to
the
northern
sallyport
stab
cut
down
or
throw
from
the
battlements
whomsoever
you
meet
in
arms
townsmen
or
strangers
leave
me
to
settle
with
these
peasants
by
fair
means
or
foul
but
ere
kilian
could
obey
his
master
commands
a
shout
arose
in
the
rear
where
they
cried
bâle
bâle
freedom
freedom
the
day
is
our
own
onward
came
the
youth
of
bâle
who
had
not
been
at
such
a
distance
but
that
rudolph
had
contrived
to
recall
them
onward
came
many
swiss
who
had
hovered
around
the
embassy
holding
themselves
in
readiness
for
such
a
piece
of
service
and
onward
came
the
armed
citizens
of
la
ferette
who
compelled
to
take
arms
and
mount
guard
by
the
tyranny
of
de
hagenbach
had
availed
themselves
of
the
opportunity
to
admit
the
bâlese
at
the
sallyport
through
which
philipson
had
lately
made
his
escape
the
garrison
somewhat
discouraged
before
by
the
firm
aspect
of
the
swiss
who
had
held
their
numbers
at
defiance
were
totally
disconcerted
by
this
new
and
unexpected
insurrection
most
of
them
prepared
rather
to
fly
than
to
fight
and
they
threw
themselves
in
numbers
from
the
walls
as
the
best
chance
of
escaping
kilian
and
some
others
whom
pride
prevented
from
flying
and
despair
from
asking
quarter
fought
with
fury
and
were
killed
on
the
spot
in
the
midst
of
this
confusion
the
landamman
kept
his
own
bands
unmoved
permitting
them
to
take
no
share
in
the
action
save
to
repel
such
violence
as
was
offered
to
them
stand
fast
all
sounded
the
deep
voice
of
arnold
biederman
along
their
little
body
where
is
rudolph
save
lives
but
take
why
how
now
arthur
philipson
stand
fast
i
say
i
can
not
stand
fast
said
arthur
who
was
in
the
act
of
leaving
the
ranks
i
must
seek
my
father
in
the
dungeons
they
may
be
slaying
him
in
this
confusion
while
i
stand
idle
here
by
our
lady
of
einsiedlen
you
say
well
answered
the
landamman
that
i
should
have
forgot
my
noble
guest
i
will
help
thee
to
search
for
him
arthur
the
affray
seems
ho
there
sir
banneret
worthy
adam
zimmerman
my
good
friend
nicholas
bonstetten
keep
our
men
standing
firm
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
affray
but
leave
the
men
of
bâle
to
answer
their
own
deeds
i
return
in
a
few
minutes
so
saying
he
hurried
after
arthur
philipson
whose
recollection
conducted
him
with
sufficient
accuracy
to
the
head
of
the
dungeon
stairs
there
they
met
an
man
clad
in
a
buff
jerkin
who
bore
at
his
girdle
a
bunch
of
rusted
keys
which
intimated
the
nature
of
his
calling
show
me
the
prison
of
the
english
merchant
said
arthur
philipson
or
thou
diest
by
my
hand
which
of
them
desire
you
to
see
answered
the
official
the
old
man
or
the
young
one
the
old
said
young
philipson
his
son
has
escaped
thee
enter
here
then
gentlemen
said
the
jailer
undoing
the
of
a
heavy
door
at
the
upper
end
of
the
apartment
lay
the
man
they
came
to
seek
for
who
was
instantly
raised
from
the
ground
and
loaded
with
their
embraces
my
dear
father
my
worthy
guest
said
his
son
and
friend
at
the
same
moment
how
fares
it
with
you
well
answered
the
elder
philipson
if
you
my
friend
and
son
come
as
i
judge
from
your
arms
and
countenance
as
conquerors
and
at
liberty
ill
if
you
come
to
share
my
have
no
fear
of
that
said
the
landamman
we
have
been
in
danger
but
are
remarkably
your
evil
lair
has
benumbed
you
lean
on
me
my
noble
guest
and
let
me
assist
you
to
better
quarters
here
he
was
interrupted
by
a
heavy
clash
as
it
seemed
of
iron
and
differing
from
the
distant
roar
of
the
popular
tumult
which
they
still
heard
from
the
open
street
as
men
hear
the
deep
voice
of
a
remote
and
tempestuous
ocean
by
peter
of
the
fetters
said
arthur
who
instantly
discovered
the
cause
of
the
sound
the
jailer
has
cast
the
door
to
the
staple
or
it
has
escaped
his
grasp
the
has
closed
upon
us
and
we
can
not
be
liberated
saving
from
the
ho
jailer
dog
villain
open
the
door
or
thou
diest
he
is
probably
out
of
hearing
of
your
threats
said
the
elder
philipson
and
your
cries
avail
you
nothing
but
are
you
sure
the
swiss
are
in
possession
of
the
town
we
are
peaceful
occupants
of
it
answered
the
landamman
though
without
a
blow
given
on
our
side
why
then
said
the
englishman
your
followers
will
soon
find
you
out
arthur
and
i
are
paltry
ciphers
and
our
absence
might
easily
pass
over
unobserved
but
you
are
too
important
a
figure
not
to
be
missed
and
looked
after
when
the
sum
of
your
number
is
taken
i
well
hope
it
will
prove
so
said
the
landamman
though
methinks
i
show
but
scurvily
shut
up
here
like
a
cat
in
a
cupboard
when
he
has
been
stealing
arthur
my
brave
boy
dost
thou
see
no
means
of
shooting
back
the
bolt
arthur
who
had
been
minutely
examining
the
lock
replied
in
the
negative
and
added
that
they
must
take
patience
perforce
and
arm
themselves
to
wait
calmly
their
deliverance
which
they
could
do
nothing
to
accelerate
arnold
biederman
however
felt
somewhat
severely
the
neglect
of
his
sons
and
companions
all
my
youths
uncertain
whether
i
am
alive
or
dead
are
taking
the
opportunity
of
my
absence
doubtless
for
pillage
and
licence
and
the
politic
rudolph
i
presume
cares
not
if
i
should
never
reappear
on
the
stage
the
banneret
and
the
fool
bonstetten
who
calls
me
his
friend
every
neighbour
has
deserted
me
and
yet
they
know
that
i
am
anxious
for
the
safety
of
the
most
insignificant
of
them
all
as
dearer
to
me
than
my
own
by
heavens
it
looks
like
stratagem
and
shows
as
if
the
rash
young
men
desired
to
get
rid
of
a
rule
too
regular
and
peaceful
to
be
pleasing
to
those
who
are
eager
for
war
and
conquest
the
landamman
fretted
out
of
his
usual
serenity
of
temper
and
afraid
of
the
misbehaviour
of
his
countrymen
in
his
absence
thus
reflected
upon
his
friends
and
companions
while
the
distant
noise
soon
died
away
into
the
most
absolute
and
total
silence
what
is
to
do
now
said
arthur
philipson
i
trust
they
will
take
the
opportunity
of
quiet
to
go
through
the
and
inquire
then
who
are
it
seemed
as
if
the
young
man
wish
had
some
efficacy
for
he
had
scarce
uttered
it
before
the
lock
was
turned
and
the
door
set
ajar
by
some
one
who
escaped
upstairs
from
behind
it
before
those
who
were
set
at
liberty
could
obtain
a
glance
of
their
deliverer
it
is
the
jailer
doubtless
said
the
landamman
who
may
be
apprehensive
as
he
has
some
reason
that
we
might
prove
more
incensed
at
our
detention
in
the
dungeon
than
grateful
for
our
deliverance
as
they
spoke
thus
they
ascended
the
narrow
stairs
and
issued
from
the
door
of
the
tower
where
a
singular
spectacle
awaited
them
the
swiss
deputies
and
their
escort
still
remained
standing
fast
and
firm
on
the
very
spot
where
hagenbach
had
proposed
to
assail
them
a
few
of
the
late
governor
soldiers
disarmed
and
cowering
from
the
rage
of
a
multitude
of
the
citizens
who
now
filled
the
streets
stood
with
downcast
looks
behind
the
phalanx
of
the
mountaineers
as
their
safest
place
of
retreat
but
this
was
not
all
the
cars
so
lately
placed
to
obstruct
the
passage
of
the
street
were
now
joined
together
and
served
to
support
a
platform
or
scaffold
which
had
been
hastily
constructed
of
planks
on
this
was
placed
a
chair
in
which
sat
a
tall
man
with
his
head
neck
and
shoulders
bare
the
rest
of
his
body
clothed
in
bright
armour
his
countenance
was
as
pale
as
death
yet
young
philipson
recognised
the
governor
sir
archibald
hagenbach
he
appeared
to
be
bound
to
the
chair
on
his
right
and
close
beside
him
stood
the
priest
of
paul
muttering
prayers
with
his
breviary
in
his
hand
while
on
his
left
and
somewhat
behind
the
captive
appeared
a
tall
man
attired
in
red
and
leaning
with
both
hands
on
the
naked
sword
which
has
been
described
on
a
former
occasion
the
instant
that
arnold
biederman
appeared
and
before
the
landamman
could
open
his
lips
to
demand
the
meaning
of
what
he
saw
the
priest
drew
back
the
executioner
stepped
forward
the
sword
was
brandished
the
blow
was
struck
and
the
victim
head
rolled
on
the
scaffold
a
general
acclamation
and
clapping
of
hands
like
that
by
which
a
crowded
theatre
approves
of
some
performer
followed
this
feat
of
dexterity
while
the
headless
corpse
shot
streams
from
the
arteries
which
were
drunk
up
by
the
sawdust
that
strewed
the
scaffold
the
executioner
gracefully
presented
himself
alternately
at
the
four
corners
of
the
stage
modestly
bowing
as
the
multitude
greeted
him
with
cheers
of
approbation
nobles
knights
gentlemen
of
blood
and
good
citizens
he
said
who
have
assisted
at
this
act
of
high
justice
i
pray
you
to
bear
me
witness
that
this
judgment
hath
been
executed
after
the
form
of
the
sentence
at
one
blow
and
without
stroke
missed
or
repeated
the
acclamations
were
reiterated
long
live
our
scharfgerichter
steinernherz
and
many
a
tyrant
may
he
do
his
duty
on
noble
friends
said
the
executioner
with
the
deepest
obeisance
i
have
yet
another
word
to
say
and
it
must
be
a
proud
god
be
gracious
to
the
soul
of
this
good
and
noble
knight
sir
archibald
de
hagenbach
he
was
the
patron
of
my
youth
and
my
guide
to
the
path
of
honour
eight
steps
have
i
made
towards
freedom
and
nobility
on
the
heads
of
freeborn
knights
and
nobles
who
have
fallen
by
his
authority
and
command
and
the
ninth
by
which
i
have
attained
it
is
upon
his
own
in
grateful
memory
of
which
i
will
expend
this
purse
of
gold
which
but
an
hour
since
he
bestowed
on
me
in
masses
for
his
soul
gentlemen
noble
friends
and
now
my
equals
la
ferette
has
lost
a
nobleman
and
gained
one
our
lady
be
gracious
to
the
departed
knight
sir
archibald
de
hagenbach
and
bless
and
prosper
the
progress
of
stephen
steinernherz
von
blutsacker
now
free
and
noble
of
right
with
that
he
took
the
feather
out
of
the
cap
of
the
deceased
which
soiled
with
the
blood
of
the
wearer
lay
near
his
body
upon
the
scaffold
and
putting
it
into
his
own
official
bonnet
received
the
homage
of
the
crowd
in
loud
huzzas
which
were
partly
in
earnest
partly
in
ridicule
of
such
an
unusual
transformation
arnold
biederman
at
length
found
breath
which
the
extremity
of
surprise
had
at
first
denied
him
indeed
the
whole
execution
had
passed
much
too
rapidly
for
the
possibility
of
his
interference
who
has
dared
to
act
this
tragedy
he
said
indignantly
and
by
what
right
has
it
taken
place
a
cavalier
richly
dressed
in
blue
replied
to
the
question
the
free
citizens
of
bâle
have
acted
for
themselves
as
the
fathers
of
swiss
liberty
set
them
an
example
and
the
tyrant
de
hagenbach
has
fallen
by
the
same
right
which
put
to
death
the
tyrant
geysler
we
bore
with
him
till
his
cup
was
brimming
over
and
then
we
bore
no
longer
i
say
not
but
that
he
deserved
death
replied
the
landamman
but
for
your
own
sake
and
for
ours
you
should
have
forborne
him
till
the
duke
pleasure
was
known
what
tell
you
us
of
the
duke
answered
laurenz
neipperg
the
same
blue
cavalier
whom
arthur
had
seen
at
the
secret
rendezvous
of
the
bâlese
youth
in
company
with
rudolph
why
talk
you
of
burgundy
to
us
who
are
none
of
his
subjects
the
emperor
our
only
rightful
lord
had
no
title
to
pawn
the
town
and
fortifications
of
la
ferette
being
as
it
is
a
dependency
of
bâle
to
the
prejudice
of
our
free
city
he
might
have
pledged
the
revenue
indeed
and
supposing
him
to
have
done
so
the
debt
has
been
paid
twice
over
by
the
exactions
levied
by
yonder
oppressor
who
has
now
received
his
due
but
pass
on
landamman
of
unterwalden
if
our
actions
displease
you
abjure
them
at
the
footstool
of
the
duke
of
burgundy
but
in
doing
so
abjure
the
memory
of
william
tell
and
stauffacher
of
furst
and
melchtal
the
fathers
of
swiss
freedom
you
speak
truth
said
the
landamman
but
it
is
in
an
and
unhappy
time
patience
would
have
remedied
your
evils
which
none
felt
more
deeply
or
would
have
redressed
more
willingly
than
i
but
oh
imprudent
young
man
you
have
thrown
aside
the
modesty
of
your
age
and
the
subjection
you
owe
to
your
elders
william
tell
and
his
brethren
were
men
of
years
and
judgment
husbands
and
fathers
having
a
right
to
be
heard
in
council
and
to
be
foremost
in
action
enough
i
leave
it
with
the
fathers
and
senators
of
your
own
city
to
acknowledge
or
to
reprove
your
but
you
my
friends
you
banneret
of
berne
you
rudolph
above
all
you
nicholas
bonstetten
my
comrade
and
my
friend
why
did
you
not
take
this
miserable
man
under
your
protection
the
action
would
have
shown
burgundy
that
we
were
slandered
by
those
who
have
declared
us
desirous
of
seeking
a
quarrel
with
him
or
of
inciting
his
subjects
to
revolt
now
all
these
prejudices
will
be
confirmed
in
the
minds
of
men
naturally
more
tenacious
of
evil
impressions
than
of
those
which
are
favourable
as
i
live
by
bread
good
gossip
and
neighbour
answered
nicholas
bonstetten
i
thought
to
obey
your
injunctions
to
a
tittle
so
much
so
that
i
once
thought
of
breaking
in
and
protecting
the
man
when
rudolph
donnerhugel
reminded
me
that
your
last
orders
were
to
stand
firm
and
let
the
men
of
bâle
answer
for
their
own
actions
and
surely
said
i
to
myself
my
gossip
arnold
knows
better
than
all
of
us
what
is
fitting
to
be
done
ah
rudolph
rudolph
said
the
landamman
looking
on
him
with
a
displeased
countenance
wert
thou
not
ashamed
thus
to
deceive
an
old
man
to
say
i
deceived
him
is
a
hard
charge
but
from
you
landamman
answered
the
bernese
with
his
usual
deference
i
can
bear
anything
i
will
only
say
that
being
a
member
of
this
embassy
i
am
obliged
to
think
and
to
give
my
opinion
as
such
especially
when
he
is
not
present
who
is
wise
enough
to
lead
and
direct
us
all
thy
words
are
always
fair
rudolph
replied
arnold
biederman
and
i
trust
so
is
thy
meaning
yet
there
are
times
when
i
somewhat
doubt
but
let
disputes
pass
and
let
me
have
your
advice
my
friends
and
for
that
purpose
go
we
where
it
may
best
profit
us
even
to
the
church
where
we
will
first
return
our
thanks
for
our
deliverance
from
assassination
and
then
hold
counsel
what
next
is
to
be
done
the
landamman
led
the
way
accordingly
to
the
church
of
paul
while
his
companions
and
associates
followed
in
their
order
this
gave
rudolph
who
as
youngest
suffered
the
others
to
precede
him
an
opportunity
to
beckon
to
him
the
landamman
eldest
son
rudiger
and
whisper
to
him
to
get
rid
of
the
two
english
merchants
away
with
them
my
dear
rudiger
by
fair
means
if
possible
but
away
with
them
directly
thy
father
is
besotted
with
these
two
english
pedlars
and
will
listen
to
no
other
counsel
and
thou
and
i
know
dearest
rudiger
that
such
men
as
these
are
unfit
to
give
laws
to
switzers
get
the
trumpery
they
have
been
robbed
of
or
as
much
of
it
as
is
extant
together
as
fast
as
thou
canst
and
send
them
in
heaven
name
rudiger
nodded
intelligently
and
went
to
offer
his
services
to
expedite
the
departure
of
the
elder
philipson
he
found
the
sagacious
merchant
as
desirous
to
escape
from
the
scene
of
confusion
now
presented
in
the
town
as
the
young
swiss
could
be
to
urge
his
departure
he
only
waited
to
recover
the
casket
of
which
de
hagenbach
had
possessed
himself
and
rudiger
biederman
set
on
foot
a
strict
search
after
it
which
was
the
more
likely
to
be
successful
that
the
simplicity
of
the
swiss
prevented
them
from
setting
the
true
value
upon
its
contents
a
strict
and
hasty
search
was
immediately
instituted
both
on
the
person
of
the
dead
de
hagenbach
on
which
the
precious
packet
was
not
to
be
found
and
on
all
who
had
approached
him
at
his
execution
or
were
supposed
to
enjoy
his
confidence
young
arthur
philipson
would
gladly
have
availed
himself
of
a
few
moments
to
bid
farewell
to
anne
of
geierstein
but
the
grey
wimple
was
no
longer
seen
in
the
ranks
of
the
switzers
and
it
was
reasonable
to
think
that
in
the
confusion
which
followed
the
execution
of
de
hagenbach
and
the
retreat
of
the
leaders
of
the
little
battalion
she
had
made
her
escape
into
some
of
the
adjacent
houses
while
the
soldiers
around
her
no
longer
restrained
by
the
presence
of
their
chiefs
had
dispersed
some
to
search
for
the
goods
of
which
the
englishmen
had
been
despoiled
others
doubtless
to
mingle
with
and
join
in
the
rejoicings
of
the
victorious
youths
of
bâle
and
of
those
burghers
of
la
ferette
by
whom
the
fortifications
of
the
town
had
been
so
gently
surrendered
the
cry
amongst
them
was
universal
that
brisach
so
long
considered
as
the
curb
of
the
swiss
confederates
and
the
barrier
against
their
commerce
should
henceforth
be
garrisoned
as
their
protection
against
the
encroachments
and
exactions
of
the
duke
of
burgundy
and
his
officers
the
whole
town
was
in
a
wild
but
joyful
jubilee
while
the
citizens
vied
with
each
other
in
offering
to
the
swiss
every
species
of
refreshment
and
the
youths
who
attended
upon
the
mission
hurried
gaily
and
in
triumph
to
profit
by
the
circumstances
which
had
so
unexpectedly
converted
the
ambuscade
so
treacherously
laid
for
them
into
a
genial
and
joyous
reception
illustration
the
execution
drawn
and
etched
by
de
los
rios
amid
this
scene
of
confusion
it
was
impossible
for
arthur
to
quit
his
father
even
to
satisfy
the
feelings
which
induced
him
to
wish
for
a
few
moments
at
his
own
disposal
sad
thoughtful
and
sorrowful
amid
the
general
joy
he
remained
with
the
parent
whom
he
had
so
much
reason
to
love
and
honour
to
assist
him
in
securing
and
placing
on
their
mule
the
various
packages
and
bales
which
the
honest
switzers
had
recovered
after
the
death
of
de
hagenbach
and
which
they
emulated
each
other
in
bringing
to
their
rightful
owner
while
they
were
with
difficulty
prevailed
on
to
accept
the
guerdon
which
the
englishman
from
the
means
which
he
had
still
left
upon
his
person
was
disposed
not
merely
to
offer
but
to
force
upon
the
restorers
of
his
property
and
which
in
their
rude
and
simple
ideas
seemed
greatly
to
exceed
the
value
of
what
they
had
recovered
for
him
this
scene
had
scarcely
lasted
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
when
rudolph
donnerhugel
approached
the
elder
philipson
and
in
a
tone
of
great
courtesy
invited
him
to
join
the
council
of
the
chiefs
of
the
embassy
of
the
swiss
cantons
who
he
said
were
desirous
of
having
the
advantage
of
his
experience
upon
some
important
questions
respecting
their
conduct
on
these
unexpected
occurrences
see
to
our
affairs
arthur
and
stir
not
from
the
spot
on
which
i
leave
you
said
philipson
to
his
son
look
especially
after
the
sealed
packet
of
which
i
was
so
infamously
and
illegally
robbed
its
recovery
is
of
the
utmost
consequence
so
speaking
he
instantly
prepared
himself
to
attend
the
bernese
who
in
a
confidential
manner
whispered
as
he
went
with
him
towards
the
church
of
paul
i
think
a
man
of
your
wisdom
will
scarce
advise
us
to
trust
ourselves
to
the
mood
of
the
duke
of
burgundy
when
he
has
received
such
an
injury
as
the
loss
of
this
fortress
and
the
execution
of
his
officer
you
at
least
would
be
too
judicious
to
afford
us
any
further
the
advantage
of
your
company
and
society
since
to
do
so
would
be
wilfully
to
engage
in
our
shipwreck
i
will
give
my
best
advice
answered
philipson
when
i
shall
be
more
particularly
acquainted
with
the
circumstances
under
which
it
is
asked
of
me
rudolph
muttered
an
oath
or
angry
exclamation
and
led
philipson
to
the
church
without
further
argument
in
a
small
chapel
adjoining
to
the
church
and
dedicated
to
magnus
the
martyr
the
four
deputies
were
assembled
in
close
conclave
around
the
shrine
in
which
the
sainted
hero
stood
armed
as
when
he
lived
the
priest
of
paul
was
also
present
and
seemed
to
interest
himself
deeply
in
the
debate
which
was
taking
place
when
philipson
entered
all
were
for
a
moment
silent
until
the
landamman
addressed
him
thus
seignor
philipson
we
esteem
you
a
man
far
travelled
well
versed
in
the
manners
of
foreign
lands
and
acquainted
with
the
conditions
of
this
duke
charles
of
burgundy
you
are
therefore
fit
to
advise
us
in
a
matter
of
great
weight
you
know
with
what
anxiety
we
go
on
this
mission
for
peace
with
the
duke
you
also
know
what
has
this
day
happened
which
may
probably
be
represented
to
charles
in
the
worst
colours
would
you
advise
us
in
such
a
case
to
proceed
to
the
duke
presence
with
the
odium
of
this
action
attached
to
us
or
should
we
do
better
to
return
home
and
prepare
for
war
with
burgundy
how
do
your
own
opinions
stand
on
the
subject
said
the
cautious
englishman
we
are
divided
answered
the
banneret
of
berne
i
have
borne
the
banner
of
berne
against
her
foes
for
thirty
years
i
am
more
willing
to
carry
it
against
the
lances
of
the
knights
of
hainault
and
lorraine
than
to
undergo
the
rude
treatment
which
we
must
look
to
meet
at
the
footstool
of
the
duke
we
put
our
heads
in
the
lion
mouth
if
we
go
forward
said
zimmerman
of
soleure
my
opinion
is
that
we
draw
back
i
would
not
advise
retreat
said
rudolph
donnerhugel
were
my
life
alone
concerned
but
the
landamman
of
unterwalden
is
the
father
of
the
united
cantons
and
it
would
be
parricide
if
i
consented
to
put
his
life
in
peril
my
advice
is
that
we
return
and
that
the
confederacy
stand
on
their
defence
my
opinion
is
different
said
arnold
biederman
nor
will
i
forgive
any
man
who
whether
in
sincere
or
feigned
friendship
places
my
poor
life
in
the
scale
with
the
advantage
of
the
cantons
if
we
go
forward
we
risk
our
heads
be
it
so
but
if
we
turn
back
we
involve
our
country
in
war
with
a
power
of
the
first
magnitude
in
europe
worthy
citizens
you
are
brave
in
fight
show
your
fortitude
as
boldly
now
and
let
us
not
hesitate
to
incur
such
personal
danger
as
may
attend
ourselves
if
by
doing
so
we
can
gain
a
chance
of
peace
for
our
country
i
think
and
vote
with
my
neighbour
and
gossip
arnold
biederman
said
the
laconic
deputy
from
schwitz
you
hear
how
we
are
divided
in
opinion
said
the
landamman
to
philipson
what
is
your
opinion
i
would
first
ask
of
you
said
the
englishman
what
has
been
your
part
in
this
storming
of
a
town
occupied
by
the
duke
forces
and
putting
to
death
his
governor
so
help
me
heaven
said
the
landamman
as
i
knew
not
of
any
purpose
of
storming
the
town
until
it
unexpectedly
took
place
and
for
the
execution
of
de
hagenbach
said
the
black
priest
i
swear
to
you
stranger
by
my
holy
order
that
it
took
place
under
the
direction
of
a
competent
court
whose
sentence
charles
of
burgundy
himself
is
bound
to
respect
and
whose
proceedings
the
deputies
of
the
swiss
mission
could
neither
have
advanced
nor
retarded
if
such
be
the
case
and
if
you
can
really
prove
yourselves
free
of
these
proceedings
answered
philipson
which
must
needs
be
highly
resented
by
the
duke
of
burgundy
i
would
advise
you
by
all
means
to
proceed
upon
your
journey
with
the
certainty
that
you
will
obtain
from
that
prince
a
just
and
impartial
hearing
and
it
may
be
a
favourable
answer
i
know
charles
of
burgundy
i
may
even
say
that
our
different
ranks
and
walks
of
life
considered
i
know
him
well
he
will
be
deeply
incensed
by
the
first
tidings
of
what
has
here
chanced
which
he
will
no
doubt
interpret
to
your
disfavour
but
if
in
the
course
of
investigation
you
are
able
to
clear
yourselves
of
these
foul
imputations
a
sense
of
his
own
injustice
may
perhaps
turn
the
balance
in
your
favour
and
in
that
case
he
will
rush
from
the
excess
of
censure
into
that
of
indulgence
but
your
cause
must
be
firmly
stated
to
the
duke
by
some
tongue
better
acquainted
with
the
language
of
courts
than
yours
and
such
a
friendly
interpreter
might
i
have
proved
to
you
had
i
not
been
plundered
of
the
valuable
packet
which
i
bore
with
me
in
order
to
present
to
the
duke
and
in
testimony
of
my
commission
to
him
a
paltry
fetch
whispered
donnerhugel
to
the
banneret
that
the
trader
may
obtain
from
us
satisfaction
for
the
goods
of
which
he
has
been
plundered
the
landamman
himself
was
perhaps
for
a
moment
of
the
same
opinion
merchant
he
said
we
hold
ourselves
bound
to
make
good
to
you
that
is
if
our
substance
can
effect
it
whatever
loss
you
may
have
sustained
trusting
to
our
protection
ay
that
we
will
said
the
old
man
of
schwitz
should
it
cost
us
twenty
zechins
to
make
it
good
to
your
guarantee
of
immunity
i
can
have
no
claim
said
philipson
seeing
i
parted
company
with
you
before
i
sustained
any
loss
and
i
regret
the
loss
not
so
much
for
its
value
although
that
is
greater
than
you
may
fancy
but
chiefly
because
that
the
contents
of
the
casket
i
bore
being
a
token
betwixt
a
person
of
considerable
importance
and
the
duke
of
burgundy
i
shall
not
i
fear
now
that
i
am
deprived
of
them
receive
from
his
grace
that
credence
which
i
desire
both
for
my
own
sake
and
yours
without
them
and
speaking
only
in
the
person
of
a
private
traveller
i
may
not
take
upon
me
as
i
might
have
done
when
using
the
names
of
the
persons
whose
mandates
i
carried
this
important
packet
said
the
landamman
shall
be
most
rigorously
sought
for
and
carefully
to
thee
for
ourselves
not
a
swiss
of
us
knows
the
value
of
its
contents
so
that
if
they
are
in
the
hands
of
any
of
our
men
they
will
be
returned
of
course
as
baubles
upon
which
they
set
no
value
as
he
spoke
there
was
a
knocking
at
the
door
of
the
chapel
rudolph
who
stood
nearest
to
it
having
held
some
communication
with
those
without
observed
with
a
smile
which
he
instantly
repressed
lest
it
had
given
offence
to
arnold
biederman
it
is
sigismund
the
good
youth
shall
i
admit
him
to
our
council
to
what
purpose
poor
simple
lad
said
his
father
with
a
sorrowful
smile
yet
let
me
undo
the
door
said
philipson
he
is
anxious
to
enter
and
perhaps
he
brings
news
i
have
observed
landamman
that
the
young
man
though
with
slowness
of
ideas
and
expression
is
strong
in
his
principles
and
sometimes
happy
in
his
conceptions
he
admitted
sigismund
accordingly
while
arnold
biederman
felt
on
the
one
hand
the
soothing
compliment
which
philipson
had
paid
to
a
boy
certainly
the
dullest
of
his
family
and
on
the
other
feared
some
public
display
of
his
son
infirmity
or
lack
of
understanding
sigismund
however
seemed
all
confidence
and
he
certainly
had
reason
to
be
so
since
as
the
shortest
mode
of
explanation
he
presented
to
philipson
the
necklace
of
diamonds
with
the
casket
in
which
it
had
been
deposited
this
pretty
thing
is
yours
he
said
i
understand
so
much
from
your
son
arthur
who
tells
me
you
will
be
glad
to
have
it
again
most
cordially
do
i
thank
you
said
the
merchant
the
necklace
is
certainly
mine
that
is
the
packet
of
which
it
formed
the
contents
was
under
my
charge
and
it
is
at
this
moment
of
greater
additional
value
to
me
than
even
its
actual
worth
since
it
serves
as
my
pledge
and
token
for
the
performance
of
an
important
and
how
my
young
friend
he
continued
addressing
sigismund
have
you
been
so
fortunate
as
to
recover
what
we
have
sought
for
hitherto
in
vain
let
me
return
my
best
acknowledgments
and
do
not
think
me
if
i
ask
how
it
reached
you
for
that
matter
said
sigismund
the
story
is
soon
told
i
had
planted
myself
as
near
the
scaffold
as
i
could
having
never
beheld
an
execution
before
and
i
observed
the
executioner
who
i
thought
did
his
duty
very
cleverly
just
in
the
moment
that
he
spread
a
cloth
over
the
body
of
de
hagenbach
snatch
something
from
the
dead
man
bosom
and
huddle
it
hastily
into
his
own
so
when
the
rumour
arose
that
an
article
of
value
was
i
hurried
in
quest
of
the
fellow
i
found
he
had
bespoke
masses
to
the
extent
of
a
hundred
crowns
at
the
high
altar
of
paul
and
i
traced
him
to
the
tavern
of
the
village
where
some
men
were
joyously
drinking
to
him
as
a
free
citizen
and
a
nobleman
so
i
stepped
in
amongst
them
with
my
partisan
and
demanded
of
his
lordship
either
to
surrender
to
me
what
he
had
thus
possessed
himself
of
or
to
try
the
weight
of
the
weapon
i
carried
his
lordship
my
lord
hangman
hesitated
and
was
about
to
make
a
brawl
but
i
was
something
peremptory
and
so
he
judged
it
best
to
give
me
the
parcel
which
i
trust
you
seignor
philipson
will
find
safe
and
entire
as
it
was
taken
from
you
and
and
i
left
them
to
conclude
their
festivities
and
that
is
the
whole
of
the
story
thou
art
a
brave
lad
said
philipson
and
with
a
heart
always
right
the
head
can
seldom
be
far
wrong
but
the
church
shall
not
lose
its
dues
and
i
take
it
on
myself
ere
i
leave
la
ferette
to
pay
for
the
masses
which
the
man
had
ordered
for
the
sake
of
de
soul
snatched
from
the
world
so
unexpectedly
sigismund
was
about
to
reply
but
philipson
fearing
he
might
bring
out
some
foolery
to
diminish
the
sense
which
his
father
had
so
joyously
entertained
of
his
late
conduct
immediately
added
hie
away
my
good
youth
and
give
to
my
son
arthur
this
precious
casket
with
simple
exultation
at
receiving
applause
to
which
he
was
little
accustomed
sigismund
took
his
leave
and
the
council
were
once
more
left
to
their
own
privacy
there
was
a
moment
silence
for
the
landamman
could
not
overcome
the
feeling
of
exquisite
pleasure
at
the
sagacity
which
poor
sigismund
whose
general
conduct
warranted
no
such
expectations
had
displayed
on
the
present
occasion
it
was
not
however
a
feeling
to
which
circumstances
permitted
him
to
give
vent
and
he
reserved
it
for
his
own
secret
enjoyment
as
a
solace
to
the
anxiety
which
he
had
hitherto
entertained
concerning
the
limited
intellect
of
this
young
man
when
he
spoke
it
was
to
philipson
with
the
usual
candour
and
manliness
of
his
character
seignor
philipson
he
said
we
will
hold
you
bound
by
no
offer
which
you
made
while
these
glittering
matters
were
out
of
your
possession
because
a
man
may
often
think
that
if
he
were
in
such
and
such
a
situation
he
would
be
able
to
achieve
certain
ends
which
that
position
being
attained
he
may
find
himself
unable
to
accomplish
but
i
now
ask
you
whether
having
thus
fortunately
and
unexpectedly
regained
possession
of
what
you
say
will
give
you
certain
credence
with
the
duke
of
burgundy
you
conceive
yourself
entitled
to
mediate
with
him
on
our
behalf
as
you
formerly
proposed
all
bent
forward
to
hear
the
merchant
answer
landamman
he
replied
i
never
spoke
the
word
in
difficulty
which
i
was
not
ready
to
redeem
when
that
difficulty
was
removed
you
say
and
i
believe
that
you
had
no
concern
with
this
storming
of
la
ferette
you
say
also
that
the
life
of
de
hagenbach
was
taken
by
a
judicature
over
which
you
had
no
control
and
exercised
none
let
a
protocol
be
drawn
up
averring
these
circumstances
and
as
far
as
possible
proving
them
intrust
it
to
me
under
seal
if
you
will
and
if
such
points
be
established
i
will
pledge
my
word
as
a
as
a
as
an
honest
man
and
a
englishman
that
the
duke
of
burgundy
will
neither
detain
nor
offer
you
any
personal
injury
i
also
hope
to
show
to
charles
strong
and
weighty
reasons
why
a
league
of
friendship
betwixt
burgundy
and
the
united
cantons
of
helvetia
is
on
his
grace
part
a
wise
and
generous
measure
but
it
is
possible
i
may
fail
in
this
last
point
and
if
i
do
i
shall
deeply
grieve
for
it
in
warranting
your
safe
passage
to
the
duke
court
and
your
safe
return
from
it
to
your
own
country
i
think
i
can
not
fail
if
i
do
my
own
life
and
that
of
my
beloved
and
only
child
shall
pay
the
ransom
for
my
excess
of
confidence
in
the
duke
justice
and
honour
the
other
deputies
stood
silent
and
looked
on
the
landamman
but
rudolph
donnerhugel
spoke
are
we
then
to
trust
our
own
lives
and
what
is
still
dearer
to
us
that
of
our
honoured
associate
arnold
biederman
on
the
simple
word
of
a
foreign
trader
we
all
know
the
temper
of
the
duke
and
how
vindictively
and
relentlessly
he
has
ever
felt
towards
our
country
and
its
interests
methinks
this
english
merchant
should
express
the
nature
of
his
interest
at
the
court
of
burgundy
more
plainly
if
he
expects
us
to
place
such
implicit
reliance
in
it
that
seignor
rudolph
donnerhugel
replied
the
merchant
i
find
myself
not
at
liberty
to
do
i
pry
not
into
your
secrets
whether
they
belong
to
you
as
a
body
or
as
individuals
my
own
are
sacred
if
i
consulted
my
own
safety
merely
i
should
act
most
wisely
to
part
company
with
you
here
but
the
object
of
your
mission
is
peace
and
your
sudden
return
after
what
has
chanced
at
la
ferette
will
make
war
inevitable
i
think
i
can
assure
you
of
a
safe
and
free
audience
from
the
duke
and
i
am
willing
for
the
chance
of
securing
the
peace
of
christendom
to
encounter
any
personal
peril
which
may
attach
to
myself
say
no
more
worthy
philipson
said
the
landamman
thy
good
faith
is
undoubted
on
our
part
and
ill
luck
is
his
who
can
not
read
it
written
on
thy
manly
forehead
we
go
forward
then
prepared
to
risk
our
own
safety
at
the
hand
of
a
despotic
prince
rather
than
leave
undischarged
the
mission
which
our
country
has
intrusted
us
with
he
is
but
half
a
brave
man
who
will
risk
his
life
only
in
the
field
of
battle
there
are
other
dangers
to
front
which
is
equally
honourable
and
since
the
weal
of
switzerland
demands
that
we
should
encounter
them
not
one
of
us
will
hesitate
to
take
the
risk
the
other
members
of
the
mission
bowed
in
assent
and
the
conclave
broke
up
to
prepare
for
their
farther
entrance
into
burgundy
footnote
note
i
chapter
xvii
upon
the
mountain
heathery
side
the
day
last
lustre
shone
and
rich
with
many
a
radiant
hue
gleam
gaily
on
the
rhone
southey
the
english
merchant
was
now
much
consulted
by
the
swiss
commissioners
in
all
their
motions
he
exhorted
them
to
proceed
with
all
despatch
on
their
journey
so
as
to
carry
to
the
duke
their
own
account
of
the
affair
of
brisach
and
thus
anticipate
all
rumours
less
favourable
to
their
conduct
on
the
occasion
for
this
purpose
philipson
recommended
that
the
deputies
dismissing
their
escort
whose
arms
and
numbers
might
give
umbrage
and
suspicion
while
they
were
too
few
for
defence
should
themselves
proceed
by
rapid
journeys
on
horseback
towards
dijon
or
wherever
the
duke
might
chance
to
be
for
the
time
this
proposal
was
however
formally
resisted
by
the
very
person
who
had
hitherto
been
the
most
ductile
of
the
party
and
the
willing
echo
of
the
landamman
pleasure
on
the
present
occasion
notwithstanding
that
arnold
biederman
declared
the
advice
of
philipson
excellent
nicholas
bonstetten
stood
in
absolute
and
insurmountable
opposition
because
having
hitherto
trusted
to
his
own
limbs
for
transporting
himself
to
and
fro
on
all
occasions
he
could
by
no
means
be
persuaded
to
commit
himself
to
the
discretion
of
a
horse
as
he
was
found
obstinately
positive
on
this
subject
it
was
finally
determined
that
the
two
englishmen
should
press
forward
on
their
journey
with
such
speed
as
they
might
and
that
the
elder
of
them
should
make
the
duke
acquainted
with
so
much
as
to
the
capture
of
la
ferette
as
he
had
himself
witnessed
of
the
matter
the
particulars
which
had
attended
the
death
of
de
hagenbach
the
landamman
assured
him
would
be
sent
to
the
duke
by
a
person
of
confidence
whose
attestation
on
the
subject
could
not
be
doubted
this
course
was
adopted
as
philipson
expressed
his
confidence
of
getting
an
early
and
private
audience
with
his
grace
of
burgundy
my
best
intercession
he
said
you
have
a
good
right
to
reckon
upon
and
no
one
can
bear
more
direct
testimony
than
i
can
to
the
ungovernable
cruelty
and
rapacity
of
de
hagenbach
of
which
i
had
so
nearly
been
the
victim
but
of
his
trial
and
execution
i
neither
know
nor
can
tell
anything
and
as
duke
charles
is
sure
to
demand
why
execution
was
done
upon
his
officer
without
an
appeal
to
his
own
tribunal
it
will
be
well
that
you
either
provide
me
with
such
facts
as
you
have
to
state
or
send
forward
at
least
as
speedily
as
possible
the
evidence
which
you
have
to
lay
before
him
on
that
most
weighty
branch
of
the
subject
the
proposal
of
the
merchant
created
some
visible
embarrassment
on
the
countenance
of
the
swiss
and
it
was
with
obvious
hesitation
that
arnold
biederman
having
led
him
aside
addressed
him
in
a
whisper
my
good
friend
he
said
mysteries
are
in
general
like
the
hateful
mists
which
disfigure
the
noblest
features
of
nature
yet
like
mists
they
will
sometimes
intervene
when
we
most
desire
their
absence
when
we
most
desire
to
be
plain
and
explicit
the
manner
of
de
death
you
saw
we
will
take
care
that
the
duke
is
informed
of
the
authority
by
which
it
was
inflicted
this
is
all
that
i
can
at
present
tell
you
on
the
subject
and
let
me
add
that
the
less
you
speak
of
it
with
any
one
you
will
be
the
more
likely
to
escape
inconvenience
worthy
landamman
said
the
englishman
i
also
am
by
nature
and
from
the
habits
of
my
country
a
hater
of
mysteries
yet
such
is
my
firm
confidence
in
your
truth
and
honour
that
you
shall
be
my
guide
in
these
dark
and
secret
transactions
even
as
amongst
the
mists
and
precipices
of
your
native
land
and
i
rest
contented
in
either
case
to
place
unlimited
confidence
in
your
sagacity
let
me
only
recommend
that
your
explanation
with
charles
be
instant
as
well
as
clear
and
candid
such
being
the
case
i
trust
my
poor
interest
with
the
duke
may
be
reckoned
for
something
in
your
favour
here
then
we
part
but
as
i
trust
soon
to
meet
again
the
elder
philipson
now
rejoined
his
son
whom
he
directed
to
hire
horses
together
with
a
guide
to
conduct
them
with
all
speed
to
the
presence
of
the
duke
of
burgundy
by
various
inquiries
in
the
town
and
especially
among
the
soldiers
of
the
slain
de
hagenbach
they
at
length
learned
that
charles
had
been
of
late
occupied
in
taking
possession
of
lorraine
and
being
now
suspicious
of
unfriendly
dispositions
on
the
part
of
the
emperor
of
germany
as
well
as
of
sigismund
duke
of
austria
had
drawn
a
considerable
part
of
his
army
together
near
strasburg
in
order
to
be
prepared
against
any
attempt
of
these
princes
or
of
the
free
imperial
cities
which
might
interfere
with
his
course
of
conquest
the
duke
of
burgundy
at
this
period
well
deserved
his
peculiar
epithet
of
the
bold
since
surrounded
by
enemies
like
one
of
the
nobler
animals
of
the
chase
he
yet
astounded
by
his
stern
and
daring
countenance
not
only
the
princes
and
states
we
have
mentioned
but
even
the
king
of
france
equally
powerful
and
far
more
politic
than
himself
to
his
camp
therefore
the
english
travellers
bent
their
way
each
full
of
such
deep
and
melancholy
reflection
as
perhaps
prevented
his
bestowing
much
attention
on
the
other
state
of
mind
they
rode
as
men
deeply
immersed
in
their
own
thoughts
and
with
less
intercourse
than
had
been
usual
betwixt
them
on
their
former
journeys
the
nobleness
of
the
elder
philipson
nature
and
his
respect
for
the
landamman
probity
joined
with
gratitude
for
his
hospitality
had
prevented
him
from
separating
his
cause
from
that
of
the
swiss
deputies
nor
did
he
now
repent
his
generosity
in
adhering
to
them
but
when
he
recollected
the
nature
and
importance
of
the
personal
affairs
which
he
himself
had
to
despatch
with
a
proud
imperious
and
irritable
prince
he
could
not
but
regret
the
circumstances
which
had
involved
his
own
particular
mission
of
so
much
consequence
to
himself
and
his
friends
with
that
of
persons
likely
to
be
so
highly
obnoxious
to
the
duke
as
arnold
biederman
and
his
companions
and
however
grateful
for
the
hospitality
of
geierstein
he
regretted
nevertheless
the
circumstances
which
had
obliged
him
to
accept
of
it
the
thoughts
of
arthur
were
no
less
anxious
he
found
himself
anew
separated
from
the
object
to
which
his
thoughts
were
almost
against
his
own
will
constantly
returning
and
this
second
separation
had
taken
place
after
he
had
incurred
an
additional
load
of
gratitude
and
found
new
as
well
as
more
mysterious
food
for
his
ardent
imagination
how
was
he
to
reconcile
the
character
and
attributes
of
anne
of
geierstein
whom
he
had
known
so
gentle
candid
pure
and
simple
with
those
of
the
daughter
of
a
sage
and
of
an
elementary
spirit
to
whom
night
was
as
day
and
an
impervious
dungeon
the
same
as
the
open
portico
of
a
temple
could
they
be
identified
as
the
same
being
or
while
strictly
alike
in
shape
and
lineament
was
the
one
a
tenant
of
the
earth
the
other
only
a
phantom
permitted
to
show
itself
among
those
of
a
nature
in
which
she
did
not
partake
above
all
must
he
never
see
her
more
or
receive
from
her
own
lips
an
explanation
of
the
mysteries
which
were
so
awfully
entwined
with
his
recollections
of
her
such
were
the
questions
which
occupied
the
mind
of
the
younger
traveller
and
prevented
him
from
interrupting
or
even
observing
the
reverie
in
which
his
father
was
plunged
had
either
of
the
travellers
been
disposed
to
derive
amusement
from
the
country
through
which
their
road
lay
the
vicinity
of
the
rhine
was
well
qualified
to
afford
it
the
ground
on
the
left
bank
of
that
noble
river
is
indeed
rather
flat
and
tame
and
the
mountains
of
alsace
a
ridge
of
which
sweeps
along
its
course
do
not
approach
so
near
as
greatly
to
vary
the
level
surface
of
the
valley
which
divides
them
from
its
shores
but
the
broad
stream
itself
hurrying
forward
with
dizzy
rapidity
and
rushing
around
the
islets
by
which
its
course
is
interrupted
is
one
of
the
most
majestic
spectacles
in
nature
the
right
bank
is
dignified
at
once
and
adorned
by
the
numerous
eminences
covered
with
wood
and
interspersed
with
valleys
which
constitute
the
district
so
well
known
by
the
name
of
the
black
forest
to
which
superstition
attached
so
many
terrors
and
credulity
such
a
variety
of
legends
terrors
indeed
it
had
of
a
real
and
existing
character
the
old
castles
seen
from
time
to
time
on
the
banks
of
the
river
itself
or
on
the
ravines
and
large
brooks
which
flow
into
it
were
then
no
picturesque
ruins
rendered
interesting
by
the
stories
which
were
told
about
their
former
inhabitants
but
constituted
the
real
and
apparently
impregnable
strongholds
of
that
whom
we
have
already
frequently
mentioned
and
of
whom
since
goethe
an
author
born
to
arouse
the
slumbering
fame
of
his
country
has
dramatised
the
story
of
goetz
of
berlichingen
we
have
had
so
many
tales
the
danger
attending
the
vicinity
of
these
fortresses
was
only
known
on
the
right
or
german
bank
of
the
rhine
for
the
breadth
and
depth
of
that
noble
stream
effectually
prevented
any
foray
of
their
inhabitants
from
reaching
alsace
the
former
was
in
possession
of
the
cities
or
free
towns
of
the
empire
and
thus
the
feudal
tyranny
of
the
german
lords
was
chiefly
exerted
at
the
expense
of
their
own
countrymen
who
irritated
and
exhausted
with
their
rapine
and
oppression
were
compelled
to
erect
barriers
against
it
of
a
nature
as
interesting
and
extraordinary
as
were
the
wrongs
from
which
they
endeavoured
to
protect
themselves
but
the
left
bank
of
the
river
over
great
part
of
which
charles
of
burgundy
exercised
his
authority
under
various
characters
was
under
the
regular
protection
of
the
ordinary
magistrates
who
were
supported
in
the
discharge
of
their
duty
by
large
bands
of
mercenary
soldiers
these
were
maintained
by
charles
out
of
his
private
revenue
he
as
well
as
his
rival
louis
and
other
princes
of
the
period
having
discovered
that
the
feudal
system
gave
an
inconvenient
degree
of
independence
to
their
vassals
and
thinking
of
course
that
it
was
better
to
substitute
in
its
place
a
standing
army
consisting
of
free
companies
or
soldiers
by
profession
italy
furnished
most
of
these
bands
which
composed
the
strength
of
charles
army
at
least
the
part
of
it
in
which
he
most
trusted
our
travellers
therefore
pursued
their
way
by
the
banks
of
the
river
in
as
great
a
degree
of
security
as
could
well
be
enjoyed
in
that
violent
and
distracted
time
until
at
length
the
father
after
having
eyed
for
some
time
the
person
whom
arthur
had
hired
to
be
their
guide
suddenly
asked
of
his
son
who
or
what
the
man
was
arthur
replied
that
he
had
been
too
eager
to
get
a
person
who
knew
the
road
and
was
willing
to
show
it
to
be
very
particular
in
inquiring
into
his
station
or
occupation
but
that
he
thought
from
the
appearance
he
must
be
one
of
those
itinerant
ecclesiastics
who
travel
through
the
country
with
relics
pardons
and
other
religious
trinkets
and
were
in
general
but
slightly
respected
excepting
by
the
lower
orders
on
whom
these
vendors
of
superstitious
wares
were
often
accused
of
practising
gross
deceptions
the
man
appearance
was
rather
that
of
a
lay
devotee
or
palmer
bound
on
his
pilgrimage
to
different
shrines
than
of
a
mendicant
friar
or
questionary
he
wore
the
hat
scrip
staff
and
coarse
dalmatic
somewhat
like
the
military
cloak
of
the
modern
hussar
which
were
used
by
such
persons
on
their
religious
peregrinations
peter
keys
rudely
shaped
out
of
some
scarlet
rag
of
cloth
appeared
on
the
back
of
his
mantle
placed
as
heralds
say
saltire
wise
this
devotee
seemed
a
man
of
fifty
and
upwards
and
stout
for
his
age
with
a
cast
of
countenance
which
though
not
positively
ugly
was
far
from
being
there
was
shrewdness
and
an
alert
expression
in
his
eye
and
actions
which
made
some
occasional
contrast
with
the
sanctimonious
demeanour
of
the
character
he
now
bore
this
difference
betwixt
his
dress
and
physiognomy
was
by
no
means
uncommon
among
persons
of
his
description
many
of
whom
embraced
this
mode
of
life
rather
to
indulge
roving
and
idle
habits
than
from
any
religious
call
who
art
thou
good
fellow
said
the
elder
philipson
and
by
what
name
am
i
to
call
thee
while
we
are
bartholomew
sir
said
the
man
brother
bartholomew
i
might
say
bartholomæus
but
it
does
not
become
a
poor
lay
brother
like
me
to
aspire
to
the
honour
of
a
learned
termination
and
whither
does
thy
journey
tend
good
brother
bartholomew
in
whichever
direction
your
worship
chooses
to
travel
and
to
require
my
services
as
guide
answered
the
palmer
always
premising
you
allow
me
leisure
for
my
devotions
at
such
holy
stations
as
we
pass
on
our
route
that
is
thine
own
journey
hath
no
professed
or
pressing
object
or
end
said
the
englishman
none
as
your
worship
says
peculiar
said
the
itinerant
or
i
might
rather
say
that
my
journey
good
sir
embraces
so
many
objects
that
it
is
matter
of
indifference
to
me
which
of
them
i
accomplish
first
my
vow
binds
me
for
four
years
to
travel
from
one
shrine
or
holy
place
to
another
but
i
am
not
directly
tied
to
visit
them
by
any
precise
rule
of
rotation
that
is
to
say
thy
vow
of
pilgrimage
does
not
prevent
thee
from
hiring
thyself
to
wait
upon
travellers
as
their
guide
replied
philipson
if
i
can
unite
the
devotion
i
owe
to
the
blessed
saints
whose
shrines
i
visit
with
a
service
rendered
to
a
wandering
who
desires
to
be
directed
upon
his
journey
i
do
maintain
replied
bartholomew
that
the
objects
are
easily
to
be
reconciled
to
each
other
especially
as
a
little
worldly
profit
may
tend
to
cement
the
two
duties
together
if
otherwise
incompatible
said
philipson
it
pleases
your
honour
to
say
so
replied
the
pilgrim
but
you
yourself
may
if
you
will
derive
from
my
good
company
something
more
than
the
mere
knowledge
of
the
road
in
which
you
propose
to
travel
i
can
make
your
journey
more
edifying
by
legends
of
the
blessed
saints
whose
holy
relics
i
have
visited
and
pleasing
by
the
story
of
the
wonderful
things
which
i
have
seen
and
heard
in
my
travels
i
can
impart
to
you
an
opportunity
of
providing
yourself
with
his
holiness
pardon
not
only
for
the
sins
which
you
have
committed
but
also
granting
you
indulgence
for
future
errors
these
things
are
highly
available
doubtless
replied
the
merchant
but
good
bartholomew
when
i
desire
to
speak
of
them
i
apply
to
my
father
confessor
to
whom
i
have
been
uniformly
regular
in
committing
the
charge
of
my
conscience
and
who
must
be
therefore
well
acquainted
with
my
state
of
mind
and
best
accustomed
to
prescribe
what
its
case
may
require
nevertheless
said
bartholomew
i
trust
your
worship
is
too
religious
a
man
and
too
sound
a
catholic
to
pass
any
hallowed
station
without
endeavouring
to
obtain
some
share
of
the
benefits
which
it
is
the
means
of
dispensing
to
those
who
are
ready
and
willing
to
deserve
them
more
especially
as
all
men
of
whatever
trade
and
degree
hold
respect
to
the
holy
saint
who
patroniseth
his
own
mystery
so
i
hope
you
being
a
merchant
will
not
pass
the
chapel
of
our
lady
of
the
ferry
without
making
some
fitting
orison
friend
bartholomew
said
philipson
i
have
not
heard
of
the
shrine
which
you
recommend
to
me
and
as
my
business
is
pressing
it
were
better
worth
my
while
to
make
a
pilgrimage
hither
on
purpose
to
make
mine
homage
at
a
fitter
season
than
to
delay
my
journey
at
present
this
god
willing
i
will
not
fail
to
do
so
that
i
may
be
held
excused
for
delaying
my
reverence
till
i
can
pay
it
more
respectfully
and
at
greater
leisure
may
it
please
you
not
to
be
wroth
said
the
guide
if
i
say
that
your
behaviour
in
this
matter
is
like
that
of
a
fool
who
finding
a
treasure
by
the
omits
to
put
it
in
his
bosom
and
carry
it
along
with
him
proposing
to
return
from
a
distance
on
a
future
day
of
express
purpose
to
fetch
it
philipson
something
astonished
at
the
man
pertinacity
was
about
to
answer
hastily
and
angrily
but
was
prevented
by
the
arrival
of
three
strangers
who
rode
hastily
up
from
behind
them
the
foremost
of
these
was
a
young
female
most
elegantly
attired
and
mounted
upon
a
spanish
jennet
which
she
reined
with
singular
grace
and
dexterity
she
wore
on
her
right
hand
such
a
glove
as
that
which
was
used
to
carry
hawks
and
had
a
merlin
perched
upon
it
her
head
was
covered
with
a
montero
cap
and
as
was
frequently
the
custom
at
the
period
she
wore
on
her
face
a
kind
of
black
silk
vizard
which
effectually
concealed
her
features
notwithstanding
this
disguise
arthur
philipson
heart
sprang
high
at
the
appearance
of
these
strangers
for
he
was
at
once
certain
he
recognised
the
matchless
form
of
the
swiss
maiden
by
whom
his
mind
was
so
anxiously
occupied
her
attendants
were
a
falconer
with
his
and
a
female
both
apparently
her
domestics
the
elder
philipson
who
had
no
such
accuracy
of
recollection
as
his
son
manifested
upon
the
occasion
saw
in
the
fair
stranger
only
some
dame
or
damsel
of
eminence
engaged
in
the
amusement
of
hawking
and
in
return
to
a
brief
salutation
merely
asked
her
with
suitable
courtesy
as
the
case
demanded
whether
she
had
spent
the
morning
in
good
sport
indifferent
good
friend
said
the
lady
i
dare
not
fly
my
hawk
so
near
the
broad
river
lest
he
should
soar
to
the
other
side
and
so
i
might
lose
my
companion
but
i
reckon
on
finding
better
game
when
i
have
crossed
to
the
other
side
of
the
ferry
which
we
are
now
approaching
then
your
ladyship
said
bartholomew
will
hear
mass
in
chapel
and
pray
for
your
success
i
were
a
heathen
to
pass
the
holy
place
without
doing
so
replied
the
damsel
that
noble
damsel
touches
the
point
we
were
but
now
talking
of
said
the
guide
bartholomew
for
know
fair
mistress
that
i
can
not
persuade
this
worthy
gentleman
how
deeply
the
success
of
his
enterprise
is
dependent
upon
his
obtaining
the
blessing
of
our
lady
of
the
ferry
the
good
man
said
the
young
maiden
seriously
and
even
severely
must
know
little
of
the
rhine
i
will
explain
to
the
gentleman
the
propriety
of
following
your
advice
she
then
rode
close
to
young
philipson
and
spoke
in
swiss
for
she
had
hitherto
used
the
german
language
do
not
start
but
hear
me
and
the
voice
was
that
of
anne
of
geierstein
do
not
i
say
be
surprised
or
at
least
show
not
your
wonder
you
are
beset
by
dangers
on
this
road
especially
your
business
is
known
your
lives
are
laid
in
wait
for
cross
over
the
river
at
the
ferry
of
the
chapel
or
ferry
as
it
is
usually
termed
here
the
guide
drew
so
near
to
them
that
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
continue
the
conversation
without
being
overheard
at
that
same
moment
a
woodcock
sprang
from
some
bushes
and
the
young
lady
threw
off
her
merlin
in
pursuit
sa
ho
sa
ho
wo
ha
hollowed
the
falconer
in
a
note
which
made
the
thicket
ring
again
and
away
he
rode
in
pursuit
the
elder
philipson
and
the
guide
himself
followed
the
chase
eagerly
with
their
eyes
so
attractive
was
the
love
of
that
brave
sport
to
men
of
all
ranks
but
the
voice
of
the
maiden
was
a
lure
which
would
have
summoned
attention
from
matters
more
deeply
interesting
cross
the
rhine
she
again
repeated
at
the
ferry
to
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
take
your
lodgings
at
the
golden
fleece
where
you
will
find
a
guide
to
strasburg
i
must
stay
here
no
longer
so
saying
the
damsel
raised
herself
in
her
saddle
struck
her
horse
lightly
with
the
loose
reins
and
the
mettled
animal
already
impatient
at
her
delay
and
the
eager
burst
of
its
companions
flew
forward
at
such
a
pace
as
if
he
had
meant
to
emulate
the
flight
of
the
hawk
and
of
the
prey
he
pursued
the
lady
and
her
attendants
soon
vanished
from
the
sight
of
the
travellers
a
deep
silence
for
some
time
ensued
during
which
arthur
studied
how
to
communicate
the
warning
he
had
received
without
awakening
the
suspicions
of
their
guide
but
the
old
man
broke
silence
himself
saying
to
bartholomew
put
your
horse
into
more
motion
i
pray
you
and
ride
onward
a
few
yards
i
would
have
some
private
conference
with
my
son
the
guide
obeyed
and
as
if
with
the
purpose
of
showing
a
mind
too
profoundly
occupied
by
heavenly
matters
to
admit
a
thought
concerning
those
of
this
transitory
world
he
thundered
forth
a
hymn
in
praise
of
wendelin
the
shepherd
in
a
strain
so
discordant
as
startled
every
bird
from
every
bush
by
which
they
passed
there
was
never
a
more
unmelodious
melody
whether
sacred
or
profane
than
that
under
protection
of
which
the
elder
philipson
thus
conferred
with
his
son
arthur
he
said
i
am
much
convinced
that
this
howling
hypocritical
vagrant
has
some
plot
upon
us
and
i
had
determined
that
the
best
mode
to
baffle
it
would
be
to
consult
my
own
opinion
and
not
his
as
to
our
places
of
repose
and
the
direction
of
our
journey
your
judgment
is
correct
as
usual
said
his
son
i
am
well
convinced
of
yonder
man
treachery
from
a
whisper
in
which
that
maiden
informed
me
that
we
ought
to
take
the
road
to
strasburg
by
the
eastern
side
of
the
river
and
for
that
purpose
cross
over
to
a
place
called
on
the
opposite
bank
do
you
advise
this
arthur
replied
his
father
i
will
pledge
my
life
for
the
faith
of
this
young
person
replied
his
son
what
said
his
father
because
she
sits
her
palfrey
fairly
and
shows
a
faultless
shape
such
is
the
reasoning
of
a
boy
and
yet
my
own
old
and
cautious
heart
feels
inclined
to
trust
her
if
our
secret
is
known
in
this
land
there
are
doubtless
many
who
may
be
disposed
to
think
they
have
an
interest
in
barring
my
access
to
the
duke
of
burgundy
even
by
the
most
violent
means
and
well
you
know
that
i
should
on
my
side
hold
my
life
equally
cheap
could
i
discharge
mine
errand
at
the
price
of
laying
it
down
i
tell
thee
arthur
that
my
mind
reproaches
me
for
taking
hitherto
over
little
care
of
insuring
the
discharge
of
my
commission
owing
to
the
natural
desire
i
had
to
keep
thee
in
my
company
there
now
lie
before
us
two
ways
both
perilous
and
uncertain
by
which
we
may
reach
the
duke
court
we
may
follow
this
guide
and
take
the
chance
of
his
fidelity
or
we
may
adopt
the
hint
of
yonder
and
cross
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
rhine
and
again
repass
the
river
at
strasburg
both
roads
are
perhaps
equally
perilous
i
feel
it
my
duty
to
diminish
the
risk
of
the
miscarriage
of
my
commission
by
sending
thee
across
to
the
right
bank
while
i
pursue
my
proposed
course
upon
the
left
thus
if
one
of
us
be
intercepted
the
other
may
escape
and
the
important
commission
which
he
bears
may
be
duly
executed
alas
my
father
said
arthur
how
is
it
possible
for
me
to
obey
you
when
by
doing
so
i
must
leave
you
alone
to
incur
so
many
dangers
to
struggle
with
so
many
difficulties
in
which
my
aid
might
be
at
least
willing
though
it
could
only
be
weak
whatever
befall
us
in
these
delicate
and
dangerous
circumstances
let
us
at
least
meet
it
in
company
arthur
my
beloved
son
said
his
father
in
parting
from
thee
i
am
splitting
mine
own
heart
in
twain
but
the
same
duty
which
commands
us
to
expose
our
bodies
to
death
as
peremptorily
orders
us
not
to
spare
our
most
tender
affections
we
must
part
oh
then
replied
his
son
eagerly
let
me
at
least
prevail
in
one
point
do
thou
my
father
cross
the
rhine
and
let
me
prosecute
the
journey
by
the
route
originally
proposed
and
why
i
pray
you
answered
the
merchant
should
i
go
one
of
these
roads
in
preference
to
the
other
because
said
arthur
eagerly
i
would
warrant
yonder
maiden
faith
with
my
life
again
young
man
said
his
father
and
wherefore
so
confident
in
that
young
maiden
faith
is
it
merely
from
the
confidence
which
youth
reposes
in
that
which
is
fair
and
pleasing
or
have
you
had
further
acquaintance
with
her
than
the
late
brief
conversation
with
her
admitted
can
i
give
you
an
answer
replied
his
son
we
have
been
long
absent
from
lands
of
knights
and
ladies
and
is
it
not
natural
that
we
should
give
to
those
who
remind
us
of
the
honoured
ties
of
chivalry
and
gentle
blood
the
instinctive
credence
which
we
refuse
to
such
a
poor
wretch
as
this
itinerant
mountebank
who
gains
his
existence
by
cheating
with
false
relics
and
forged
legends
the
poor
peasants
amongst
whom
he
travels
it
is
a
vain
imagination
arthur
said
his
father
not
unbefitting
indeed
an
aspirant
to
the
honours
of
chivalry
who
draws
his
ideas
of
life
and
its
occurrences
from
the
romances
of
the
minstrels
but
too
visionary
for
a
youth
who
has
seen
as
thou
hast
how
the
business
of
this
world
is
conducted
i
tell
thee
and
thou
wilt
learn
to
know
i
say
truth
that
around
the
homely
board
of
our
host
the
landamman
were
ranged
truer
tongues
and
more
faithful
hearts
than
the
of
a
monarch
has
to
boast
alas
the
manly
spirit
of
ancient
faith
and
honour
has
fled
even
from
the
breast
of
kings
and
knights
where
as
john
of
france
said
it
ought
to
continue
to
reside
a
constant
inhabitant
if
banished
from
all
the
rest
of
the
world
be
that
as
it
may
dearest
father
replied
the
younger
philipson
i
pray
you
to
be
persuaded
by
me
and
if
we
must
part
company
let
it
be
by
your
taking
the
right
bank
of
the
rhine
since
i
am
persuaded
it
is
the
safest
route
and
if
it
be
the
safest
said
his
father
with
a
voice
of
tender
reproach
is
that
a
reason
why
i
should
spare
my
own
almost
exhausted
thread
of
life
and
expose
thine
my
dear
son
which
has
but
begun
its
course
nay
father
answered
the
son
with
animation
in
speaking
thus
you
do
not
consider
the
difference
of
our
importance
to
the
execution
of
the
purpose
which
you
have
so
long
entertained
and
which
seems
now
so
nigh
being
accomplished
think
how
imperfectly
i
might
be
able
to
discharge
it
without
knowledge
of
the
duke
person
or
credentials
to
gain
his
confidence
i
might
indeed
repeat
your
words
but
the
circumstances
would
be
wanting
to
attract
the
necessary
faith
and
of
consequence
your
scheme
for
the
success
of
which
you
have
lived
and
now
are
willing
to
run
the
risk
of
death
would
miscarry
along
with
me
you
can
not
shake
my
resolution
said
the
elder
philipson
or
persuade
me
that
my
life
is
of
more
importance
than
yours
you
only
remind
me
that
it
is
you
and
not
i
who
ought
to
be
the
bearer
of
this
token
to
the
duke
of
burgundy
should
you
be
successful
in
reaching
his
court
or
camp
your
possession
of
these
gems
will
be
needful
to
attach
credit
to
your
mission
a
purpose
for
which
they
would
be
less
necessary
to
me
who
can
refer
to
other
circumstances
under
which
i
might
claim
credence
if
it
should
please
heaven
to
leave
me
alone
to
acquit
myself
of
this
important
commission
which
may
our
lady
in
her
mercy
forefend
understand
therefore
that
should
an
opportunity
occur
by
which
you
can
make
your
way
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
rhine
you
are
to
direct
your
journey
so
as
again
to
cross
to
this
bank
at
strasburg
where
you
will
inquire
for
news
of
me
at
the
flying
stag
a
hostelry
in
that
city
which
you
will
easily
discover
if
you
hear
no
tidings
of
me
at
that
place
you
will
proceed
to
the
duke
and
deliver
to
him
this
important
packet
here
he
put
into
his
son
hand
with
as
much
privacy
as
possible
the
case
containing
the
diamond
necklace
what
else
your
duty
calls
on
you
to
do
continued
the
elder
philipson
you
well
know
only
i
conjure
you
let
no
vain
inquiries
after
my
fate
interfere
with
the
great
duty
you
have
there
to
discharge
in
the
meantime
prepare
to
bid
me
a
sudden
farewell
with
a
heart
as
bold
and
confident
as
when
you
went
before
me
and
courageously
led
the
way
amid
the
rocks
and
storms
of
switzerland
heaven
was
above
us
then
as
it
is
over
us
now
adieu
my
beloved
arthur
should
i
wait
till
the
moment
of
separation
there
may
be
but
short
time
to
speak
the
fatal
word
and
no
eye
save
thine
own
must
see
the
tear
which
i
now
wipe
away
the
painful
feeling
which
accompanied
this
anticipation
of
their
parting
was
so
sincere
on
arthur
part
as
well
as
that
of
his
father
that
it
did
not
at
first
occur
to
the
former
as
a
source
of
consolation
that
it
seemed
likely
he
might
be
placed
under
the
guidance
of
the
singular
female
the
memory
of
whom
haunted
him
true
it
was
that
the
beauty
of
anne
of
geierstein
as
well
as
the
striking
circumstances
in
which
she
had
exhibited
herself
had
on
that
very
morning
been
the
principal
occupation
of
his
mind
but
they
were
now
chased
from
it
by
the
predominant
recollection
that
he
was
about
to
be
separated
in
a
moment
of
danger
from
a
father
so
well
deserving
of
his
highest
esteem
and
his
fondest
affection
meanwhile
that
father
dashed
from
his
eye
the
tear
which
his
devoted
stoicism
could
not
suppress
and
as
if
afraid
of
softening
his
resolution
by
indulging
his
parental
fondness
he
recalled
the
pious
bartholomew
to
demand
of
him
how
far
they
were
from
the
chapel
of
the
ferry
little
more
than
a
mile
was
the
reply
and
when
the
englishman
required
further
information
concerning
the
cause
of
its
erection
he
was
informed
that
an
old
boatman
and
fisherman
named
hans
had
long
dwelt
at
the
place
who
gained
a
precarious
livelihood
by
transporting
travellers
and
merchants
from
one
bank
of
the
river
to
the
other
the
misfortune
however
of
losing
first
one
boat
and
then
a
second
in
the
deep
and
mighty
stream
with
the
dread
inspired
in
travellers
by
the
repetition
of
such
accidents
began
to
render
his
profession
an
uncertain
one
being
a
good
catholic
the
old
man
distress
took
a
devotional
turn
he
began
to
look
back
on
his
former
life
and
consider
by
what
crimes
he
had
deserved
the
misfortunes
which
darkened
the
evening
of
his
days
his
remorse
was
chiefly
excited
by
the
recollection
that
he
had
on
one
occasion
when
the
passage
was
peculiarly
stormy
refused
to
discharge
his
duty
as
a
ferryman
in
order
to
transport
to
the
other
shore
a
priest
who
bore
along
with
him
an
image
of
the
virgin
destined
for
the
village
of
on
the
opposite
or
right
bank
of
the
rhine
for
this
fault
hans
submitted
to
severe
penance
as
he
was
now
disposed
to
consider
as
culpable
his
doubt
of
the
virgin
power
of
protecting
herself
her
priest
and
the
bark
employed
in
her
service
besides
which
the
offering
of
a
large
share
of
his
worldly
goods
to
the
church
of
expressed
the
truth
of
the
old
man
repentance
neither
did
he
ever
again
permit
himself
to
interpose
any
delay
in
the
journey
of
men
of
holy
church
but
all
ranks
of
the
clergy
from
the
mitred
prelate
to
the
barefooted
friar
might
at
any
time
of
day
or
night
have
commanded
the
services
of
him
and
his
boat
while
prosecuting
so
laudable
a
course
of
life
it
became
at
length
the
lot
of
hans
to
find
on
the
banks
of
the
rhine
a
small
image
of
the
virgin
thrown
by
the
waves
which
appeared
to
him
exactly
to
resemble
that
which
he
had
formerly
ungraciously
refused
to
carry
across
when
under
charge
of
the
sacristan
of
he
placed
it
in
the
most
conspicuous
part
of
his
hut
and
poured
out
his
soul
before
it
in
devotion
anxiously
inquiring
for
some
signal
by
which
he
might
discover
whether
he
was
to
consider
the
arrival
of
her
holy
image
as
a
pledge
that
his
offences
were
forgiven
in
the
visions
of
the
night
his
prayers
were
answered
and
our
lady
assuming
the
form
of
the
image
stood
by
his
bedside
for
the
purpose
of
telling
him
wherefore
she
had
come
hither
my
trusty
servant
she
said
men
of
belial
have
burned
my
dwelling
at
spoiled
my
chapel
and
thrown
the
sacred
image
which
represents
me
into
the
swoln
rhine
which
swept
me
downward
now
i
have
resolved
to
dwell
no
longer
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
profane
doers
of
this
deed
or
of
the
cowardly
vassals
who
dared
not
prevent
it
i
am
therefore
compelled
to
remove
my
habitation
and
in
despite
of
the
opposing
current
i
determined
to
take
the
shore
on
this
side
being
resolved
to
fix
my
abode
with
thee
my
faithful
servant
that
the
land
in
which
thou
dwellest
may
be
blessed
as
well
as
thou
and
thy
household
as
the
vision
spoke
she
seemed
to
wring
from
her
tresses
the
water
in
which
they
had
been
steeped
while
her
disordered
dress
and
fatigued
appearance
was
that
of
one
who
has
been
buffeting
with
the
waves
next
morning
brought
intelligence
that
in
one
of
the
numerous
feuds
of
that
fierce
period
had
been
sacked
the
church
destroyed
and
the
church
treasury
plundered
in
consequence
of
the
fisherman
vision
being
thus
remarkably
confirmed
hans
entirely
renounced
his
profession
and
leaving
it
to
younger
men
to
supply
his
place
as
ferryman
he
converted
his
hut
into
a
rustic
chapel
and
he
himself
taking
orders
attended
upon
the
shrine
as
a
hermit
or
daily
chaplain
the
figure
was
supposed
to
work
miracles
and
the
ferry
became
renowned
from
its
being
under
the
protection
of
the
holy
image
of
our
lady
and
her
no
less
holy
servant
when
bartholomew
had
concluded
his
account
of
the
ferry
and
its
chapel
the
travellers
had
arrived
at
the
place

the

hans
had
successors
in
his
profession
as
a
boatman
the
river
which
at
a
point
a
little
lower
was
restrained
by
a
chain
of
islets
expanded
more
widely
and
moved
less
rapidly
than
when
it
passed
these
cottages
affording
to
the
ferryman
a
smoother
surface
and
a
less
heavy
stream
to
contend
with
although
the
current
was
even
there
too
strong
to
be
borne
up
against
unless
the
river
was
in
a
tranquil
state
on
the
opposite
bank
but
a
good
deal
lower
than
the
hamlet
which
gave
name
to
the
ferry
was
seated
on
a
small
eminence
screened
by
trees
and
bushes
the
little
town
of
a
skiff
departing
from
the
left
bank
was
even
on
favourable
occasions
carried
considerably
to
leeward
ere
it
could
attain
the
opposite
side
of
the
deep
and
full
stream
of
the
rhine
so
that
its
course
was
oblique
towards
on
the
other
hand
a
boat
departing
from
must
have
great
advantage
both
of
wind
and
oars
in
order
to
land
its
loading
or
crew
at
the
chapel
of
the
ferry
unless
it
were
under
the
miraculous
influence
which
carried
the
image
of
the
virgin
in
that
direction
the
communication
therefore
from
the
east
to
the
west
bank
was
only
maintained
by
towing
boats
up
the
stream
to
such
a
height
on
the
eastern
side
that
the
leeway
which
they
made
during
the
voyage
across
might
correspond
with
the
point
at
which
they
desired
to
arrive
and
enable
them
to
attain
it
with
ease
hence
it
naturally
happened
that
the
passage
from
alsace
into
suabia
being
the
most
easy
the
ferry
was
more
used
by
those
who
were
desirous
of
entering
germany
than
by
travellers
who
came
in
an
opposite
direction
when
the
elder
philipson
had
by
a
glance
around
him
ascertained
the
situation
of
the
ferry
he
said
firmly
to
his
son
begone
my
dear
arthur
and
do
what
i
have
commanded
thee
with
a
heart
rent
with
filial
anxiety
the
young
man
obeyed
and
took
his
solitary
course
towards
the
cottages
near
which
the
barks
were
moored
which
were
occasionally
used
for
fishing
as
well
as
for
the
purposes
of
the
ferry
your
son
leaves
us
said
bartholomew
to
the
elder
philipson
he
does
for
the
present
said
his
father
as
he
has
certain
inquiries
to
make
in
yonder
hamlet
if
they
be
answered
the
guide
any
matters
connected
with
your
honour
road
i
laud
the
saints
that
i
can
better
answer
your
inquiries
than
those
ignorant
boors
who
hardly
understand
your
language
if
we
find
that
their
information
needs
thy
commentary
said
philipson
we
will
request
it
meanwhile
lead
on
to
the
chapel
where
my
son
will
join
us
they
moved
towards
the
chapel
but
with
slow
steps
each
turning
his
looks
aside
to
the
the
guide
as
if
striving
to
see
whether
the
younger
traveller
was
returning
towards
them
the
father
anxious
to
descry
on
the
broad
bosom
of
the
rhine
a
sail
unloosed
to
waft
his
son
across
to
that
which
might
be
considered
as
the
safer
side
but
though
the
looks
of
both
guide
and
traveller
were
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
river
their
steps
carried
them
towards
the
chapel
to
which
the
inhabitants
in
memory
of
the
founder
had
given
the
title
of
a
few
trees
scattered
around
gave
an
agreeable
and
silvan
air
to
the
place
and
the
chapel
that
appeared
on
a
rising
ground
at
some
distance
from
the
hamlet
was
constructed
in
a
style
of
pleasing
simplicity
which
corresponded
with
the
whole
scene
its
small
size
confirmed
the
tradition
that
it
had
originally
been
merely
the
hut
of
a
peasant
and
the
cross
of
covered
with
bark
attested
the
purpose
to
which
it
was
now
dedicated
the
chapel
and
all
around
it
breathed
peace
and
solemn
tranquillity
and
the
deep
sound
of
the
mighty
river
seemed
to
impose
silence
on
each
human
voice
which
might
presume
to
mingle
with
its
awful
murmur
when
philipson
arrived
in
the
vicinity
bartholomew
took
the
advantage
afforded
by
his
silence
to
thunder
forth
two
stanzas
to
the
praise
of
the
lady
of
the
ferry
and
her
faithful
worshipper
hans
after
which
he
broke
forth
into
the
rapturous
exclamation
come
hither
ye
who
fear
wreck
here
is
your
safe
haven
come
hither
ye
who
die
of
thirst
here
is
a
well
of
mercy
open
to
you
come
those
who
are
weary
and
this
is
your
place
of
refreshment
and
more
to
the
same
purpose
he
might
have
said
but
philipson
sternly
imposed
silence
on
him
if
thy
devotion
were
altogether
true
he
said
it
would
be
less
clamorous
but
it
is
well
to
do
what
is
good
in
itself
even
if
it
is
a
hypocrite
who
recommends
let
us
enter
this
holy
chapel
and
pray
for
a
fortunate
issue
to
our
precarious
travels
the
pardoner
caught
up
the
last
words
sure
was
i
he
said
that
your
worship
is
too
well
advised
to
pass
this
holy
place
without
imploring
the
protection
and
influence
of
our
lady
of
the
ferry
tarry
but
a
moment
until
i
find
the
priest
who
serves
the
altar
that
he
may
say
a
mass
on
your
behalf
here
he
was
interrupted
by
the
door
of
the
chapel
suddenly
opening
when
an
ecclesiastic
appeared
on
the
threshold
philipson
instantly
knew
the
priest
of
paul
whom
he
had
seen
that
morning
at
la
ferette
bartholomew
also
knew
him
as
it
would
seem
for
his
officious
hypocritical
eloquence
failed
him
in
an
instant
and
he
stood
before
the
priest
with
his
arms
folded
on
his
breast
like
a
man
who
waits
for
the
sentence
of
condemnation
villain
said
the
ecclesiastic
regarding
the
guide
with
a
severe
countenance
dost
thou
lead
a
stranger
into
the
houses
of
the
holy
saints
that
thou
mayst
slay
him
and
possess
thyself
of
his
spoils
but
heaven
will
no
longer
bear
with
thy
perfidy
back
thou
wretch
to
meet
thy
brother
miscreants
who
are
hastening
hitherward
tell
them
thy
arts
were
unavailing
and
that
the
innocent
stranger
is
under
my
protection
under
my
protection
which
those
who
presume
to
violate
will
meet
with
the
reward
of
archibald
de
hagenbach
the
guide
stood
quite
motionless
while
addressed
by
the
priest
in
a
manner
equally
menacing
and
authoritative
and
no
sooner
did
the
latter
cease
speaking
than
without
offering
a
word
either
in
justification
or
reply
bartholomew
turned
round
and
retreated
at
a
hasty
pace
by
the
same
road
which
had
conducted
the
traveller
to
the
chapel
and
do
you
worthy
englishman
continued
the
priest
enter
into
this
chapel
and
perform
in
safety
those
devotions
by
means
of
which
yonder
hypocrite
designed
to
detain
you
until
his
brethren
in
iniquity
came
but
first
wherefore
are
you
alone
i
trust
naught
evil
hath
befallen
your
young
companion
my
son
said
philipson
crosses
the
rhine
at
yonder
ferry
as
we
had
important
business
to
transact
on
the
other
side
as
he
spoke
thus
a
light
boat
about
which
two
or
three
peasants
had
been
for
some
time
busy
was
seen
to
push
from
the
shore
and
shoot
into
the
stream
to
which
it
was
partly
compelled
to
give
way
until
a
sail
stretched
along
the
slender
yard
and
supporting
the
bark
against
the
current
enabled
her
to
stand
obliquely
across
the
river
now
praise
be
to
god
said
philipson
who
was
aware
that
the
bark
he
looked
upon
must
be
in
the
act
of
carrying
his
son
beyond
the
reach
of
the
dangers
by
which
he
was
himself
surrounded
amen
answered
the
priest
echoing
the
pious
ejaculation
of
the
traveller
great
reason
have
you
to
return
thanks
to
heaven
of
that
i
am
convinced
replied
philipson
but
yet
from
you
i
hope
to
learn
the
special
cause
of
danger
from
which
i
have
escaped
this
is
neither
time
nor
place
for
such
an
investigation
answered
the
priest
of
paul
it
is
enough
to
say
that
yonder
fellow
well
known
for
his
hypocrisy
and
his
crimes
was
present
when
the
young
switzer
sigismund
reclaimed
from
the
executioner
the
treasure
of
which
you
were
robbed
by
hagenbach
thus
bartholomew
avarice
was
awakened
he
undertook
to
be
your
guide
to
strasburg
with
the
criminal
intent
of
detaining
you
by
the
way
till
a
party
came
up
against
whose
numbers
resistance
would
have
been
in
vain
but
his
purpose
has
been
and
now
ere
giving
vent
to
other
worldly
thoughts
whether
of
hope
or
fear
to
the
chapel
sir
and
join
in
orisons
to
him
who
hath
been
your
aid
and
to
those
who
have
interceded
with
him
in
your
behalf
philipson
entered
the
chapel
with
his
guide
and
joined
in
returning
thanks
to
heaven
and
the
tutelary
power
of
the
spot
for
the
escape
which
had
been
vouchsafed
to
him
when
this
duty
had
been
performed
philipson
intimated
his
purpose
of
resuming
his
journey
to
which
the
black
priest
replied
that
far
from
delaying
him
in
a
place
so
dangerous
he
would
himself
accompany
him
for
some
part
of
the
journey
since
he
also
was
bound
to
the
presence
of
the
duke
of
burgundy
you
my
father
you
said
the
merchant
with
some
astonishment
and
wherefore
surprised
answered
the
priest
is
it
so
strange
that
one
of
my
order
should
visit
a
prince
court
believe
me
there
are
but
too
many
of
them
to
be
found
there
i
do
not
speak
with
reference
to
your
order
answered
philipson
but
in
regard
of
the
part
which
you
have
this
day
acted
in
abetting
the
execution
of
archibald
de
hagenbach
know
you
so
little
of
the
fiery
duke
of
burgundy
as
to
imagine
you
can
dally
with
his
resentment
with
more
safety
than
you
would
pull
the
mane
of
a
sleeping
lion
i
know
his
mood
well
said
the
priest
and
it
is
not
to
excuse
but
to
defend
the
death
of
de
hagenbach
that
i
go
to
his
presence
the
duke
may
execute
his
serfs
and
bondsmen
at
his
pleasure
but
there
is
a
spell
upon
my
life
which
is
proof
to
all
his
power
but
let
me
retort
the
question
you
sir
englishman
knowing
the
conditions
of
the
duke
so
well
you
so
lately
the
guest
and
travelling
companion
of
the
most
unwelcome
visitors
who
could
approach
him
you
implicated
in
appearance
at
least
in
the
uproar
at
la
ferette
what
chance
is
there
of
your
escaping
his
vengeance
and
wherefore
will
you
throw
yourself
wantonly
within
his
power
worthy
father
said
the
merchant
let
each
of
us
without
offence
to
the
other
keep
his
own
secret
i
have
indeed
no
spell
to
secure
me
from
the
duke
resentment
i
have
limbs
to
suffer
torture
and
imprisonment
and
property
which
may
be
seized
and
confiscated
but
i
have
had
in
former
days
many
dealings
with
the
duke
i
may
even
say
i
have
laid
him
under
obligations
and
hope
my
interest
with
him
may
in
consequence
be
sufficient
not
only
to
save
me
from
the
consequences
of
this
day
procedure
but
be
of
some
avail
to
my
friend
the
landamman
but
if
you
are
in
reality
bound
to
the
court
of
burgundy
as
a
merchant
said
the
priest
where
are
the
wares
in
which
you
traffic
have
you
no
merchandise
save
that
which
you
carry
on
your
person
i
heard
of
a
with
baggage
has
yonder
villain
deprived
you
of
it
this
was
a
trying
question
to
philipson
who
anxious
about
the
separation
from
his
son
had
given
no
direction
whether
the
baggage
should
remain
with
himself
or
should
be
transported
to
the
other
side
of
the
rhine
he
was
therefore
taken
at
advantage
by
the
inquiry
to
which
he
answered
with
some
incoherence
i
believe
my
baggage
is
in
the
hamlet
that
is
unless
my
son
has
taken
it
across
the
rhine
with
him
that
we
will
soon
learn
answered
the
priest
here
a
novice
appeared
from
the
vestiary
of
the
chapel
at
his
call
and
received
commands
to
inquire
at
the
hamlet
whether
bales
with
the
horse
which
transported
them
had
been
left
there
or
ferried
over
along
with
his
son
the
novice
being
absent
a
few
minutes
presently
returned
with
the
which
with
its
burden
arthur
from
regard
to
his
father
accommodation
had
left
on
the
western
side
of
the
river
the
priest
looked
on
attentively
while
the
elder
philipson
mounting
his
own
horse
and
taking
the
rein
of
the
other
in
his
hand
bade
the
black
priest
adieu
in
these
words
and
now
father
farewell
i
must
pass
on
with
my
bales
since
there
is
little
wisdom
in
travelling
with
them
after
nightfall
else
would
i
gladly
suit
my
pace
with
your
permission
so
as
to
share
the
way
with
you
if
it
is
your
obliging
purpose
to
do
so
as
indeed
i
was
about
to
propose
said
the
priest
know
i
will
be
no
stay
to
your
journey
i
have
here
a
good
horse
and
melchior
who
must
otherwise
have
gone
on
foot
may
ride
upon
your
i
the
rather
propose
this
course
as
it
will
be
rash
for
you
to
travel
by
night
i
can
conduct
you
to
an
hostelry
about
five
miles
off
which
we
may
reach
with
sufficient
daylight
and
where
you
will
be
lodged
safely
for
your
reckoning
the
english
merchant
hesitated
a
moment
he
had
no
fancy
for
any
new
companion
on
the
road
and
although
the
countenance
of
the
priest
was
rather
handsome
considering
his
years
yet
the
expression
was
such
as
by
no
means
invited
confidence
on
the
contrary
there
was
something
mysterious
and
gloomy
which
clouded
his
brow
though
it
was
a
lofty
one
and
a
similar
expression
gleamed
in
his
cold
grey
eye
and
intimated
severity
and
even
harshness
of
disposition
but
notwithstanding
this
repulsive
circumstance
the
priest
had
lately
rendered
philipson
a
considerable
service
by
detecting
the
treachery
of
his
hypocritical
guide
and
the
merchant
was
not
a
man
to
be
startled
from
his
course
by
any
imaginary
prepossessions
against
the
looks
or
manners
of
any
one
or
apprehensions
of
machinations
against
himself
he
only
revolved
in
his
mind
the
singularity
attending
his
destiny
which
while
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
appear
before
the
duke
of
burgundy
in
the
most
conciliatory
manner
seemed
to
force
upon
him
the
adoption
of
companions
who
must
needs
be
obnoxious
to
that
prince
and
such
he
was
too
well
aware
must
be
the
case
with
the
priest
of
paul
having
reflected
for
an
instant
he
courteously
accepted
the
offer
of
the
priest
to
guide
him
to
some
place
of
rest
and
entertainment
which
must
be
absolutely
necessary
for
his
horse
before
he
reached
strasburg
even
if
he
himself
could
have
dispensed
with
it
the
party
being
thus
arranged
the
novice
brought
forth
the
steed
which
he
mounted
with
grace
and
agility
and
the
neophyte
being
probably
the
same
whom
arthur
had
represented
during
his
escape
from
la
ferette
took
charge
at
his
master
command
of
the
of
the
englishman
and
crossing
himself
with
a
humble
inclination
of
his
head
as
the
priest
passed
him
he
fell
into
the
rear
and
seemed
to
pass
the
time
like
the
false
brother
bartholomew
in
telling
his
beads
with
an
earnestness
which
had
perhaps
more
of
affected
than
of
real
piety
the
black
priest
of
paul
to
judge
by
the
glance
which
he
cast
upon
his
novice
seemed
to
disdain
the
formality
of
the
young
man
devotion
he
rode
upon
a
strong
black
horse
more
like
a
warrior
charger
than
the
ambling
palfrey
of
a
priest
and
the
manner
in
which
he
managed
him
was
entirely
devoid
of
awkwardness
and
timidity
his
pride
whatever
was
its
character
was
not
certainly
of
a
kind
altogether
professional
but
had
its
origin
in
other
swelling
thoughts
which
arose
in
his
mind
to
mingle
with
and
enhance
the
of
a
powerful
ecclesiastic
as
philipson
looked
on
his
companion
from
time
to
time
his
scrutinising
glance
was
returned
by
a
haughty
smile
which
seemed
to
say
you
may
gaze
on
my
form
and
features
but
you
can
not
penetrate
my
mystery
the
looks
of
philipson
which
were
never
known
to
sink
before
mortal
man
seemed
to
retort
with
equal
haughtiness
nor
shall
you
proud
priest
know
that
you
are
now
in
company
with
one
whose
secret
is
far
more
important
than
thine
own
can
be
at
length
the
priest
made
some
advance
towards
conversation
by
allusion
to
the
footing
upon
which
by
a
mutual
understanding
they
seemed
to
have
placed
their
intercourse
we
travel
then
he
said
like
two
powerful
enchanters
each
conscious
of
his
own
high
and
secret
purpose
each
in
his
own
chariot
of
clouds
and
neither
imparting
to
his
companion
the
direction
or
purpose
of
his
journey
excuse
me
father
answered
philipson
i
have
neither
asked
your
purpose
nor
concealed
my
own
so
far
as
it
concerns
you
i
repeat
i
am
bound
to
the
presence
of
the
duke
of
burgundy
and
my
object
like
that
of
any
other
merchant
is
to
dispose
of
my
wares
to
advantage
doubtless
it
would
seem
so
said
the
black
priest
from
the
extreme
attention
to
your
merchandise
which
you
showed
not
above
half
an
hour
since
when
you
knew
not
whether
your
bales
had
crossed
the
river
with
your
son
or
were
remaining
in
your
own
charge
are
english
merchants
usually
so
indifferent
to
the
sources
of
their
traffic
when
their
lives
are
in
danger
said
philipson
they
are
sometimes
negligent
of
their
fortune
it
is
well
replied
the
priest
and
again
resumed
his
solitary
musings
until
another
travelling
brought
them
to
a
or
village
which
the
black
priest
informed
philipson
was
that
where
he
proposed
to
stop
for
the
night
the
novice
he
said
will
show
you
the
inn
which
is
of
good
reputation
and
where
you
may
lodge
with
safety
for
me
i
have
to
visit
a
penitent
in
this
village
who
desires
my
ghostly
offices
perhaps
i
may
see
you
again
this
evening
perhaps
not
till
the
next
morning
at
any
rate
adieu
for
the
present
so
saying
the
priest
stopped
his
horse
while
the
novice
coming
close
up
to
philipson
side
conducted
him
onward
through
the
narrow
street
of
the
village
whilst
the
windows
exhibited
here
and
there
a
twinkling
gleam
announcing
that
the
hour
of
darkness
was
arrived
finally
he
led
the
englishman
through
an
archway
into
a
sort
of
courtyard
where
there
stood
a
car
or
two
of
a
particular
shape
used
occasionally
by
women
when
they
travel
and
some
other
vehicles
of
the
same
kind
here
the
young
man
threw
himself
from
the
and
placing
the
rein
in
philipson
hand
disappeared
in
the
increasing
darkness
after
pointing
to
a
large
but
dilapidated
building
along
the
front
of
which
not
a
spark
of
light
was
to
be
discovered
from
any
of
the
narrow
and
numerous
windows
which
were
dimly
visible
in
the
twilight

there
is

none

at

in

probably
in

the
chief
executioner
is
one
of

is
as
proud
of
the

the
circumstances

such
was
the
detestation
in
which
this
cruel
governor
was
held
that
multitudes
flocked
in
from
all
quarters
to
be
present
at
his
trial
he
heard
from
his
prison
the
bridge
with
the
tread
of
horses

would
ask
of
his
jailer
respecting
those
who
were
arriving
whether
they
might
be

desirous
of
witnessing

other

execute
his
duty
was
to
obey
who
is
ignorant
of
the
submission
due
by
military
retainers
to
their
lord
and
master
can
any
one
believe
that
the
landvogt
of
my
lord
the
duke
could
remonstrate
with
or
resist
him
and
has
not
my
lord
confirmed
and
ratified
by
his
presence
all
acts
done
in
his
name
if
imposts
have
been
levied
it
was
because
he
had
need
of
money
to
obtain
it
it
was
necessary
to
punish
those
who
refused
payment
this
proceeding
my
lord
the
duke
and
the
emperor
himself
when
present
have
considered
as
expedient
the
quartering
of
soldiers
was
also
in
accordance
with
the
orders
of
the
duke
with
respect
to
the
jurisdiction
of
brisach
could
the
landvogt
permit
any
resistance
from
that
quarter
to
conclude
in
so
serious
an
affair
one
which
touches
the
life
of
the
prisoner
can
the
last
accusation
be
really
considered
a
grievance
among
all
those
who
hear
me
is
there
one
man
who
can
say
he
has
never
committed
similar
imprudences
is
it
not
evident
that
messire
de
hagenbach
has
only
taken
advantage
of
the
of
some
girls
and
women
or
at
the
worst
that
his
money
was
the
only
restraint
imposed
upon
them
the
judges
sat
for
a
long
time
on
the
tribunal
twelve
hours
elapsed
before
the
termination
of
the
trial
the
knight
of
hagenbach
always
calm
and
undaunted
brought
forward
no
other
defence
or
excuse
than
what
he
had
before
given
when
under
the
torture
viz
the
orders
and
will
of
his
lord
who
alone
was
his
judge
and
who
alone
could
demand
an
explanation
at
length
at
seven
in
the
evening
and
by
the
light
of
torches
the
judges
after
having
declared
it
their
province
to
pronounce
judgment
on
the
crimes
of
which
the
landvogt
was
accused
caused
him
to
be
called
before
them
and
delivered
their
sentence
condemning
him
to
death
he
betrayed
no
emotion
and
only
demanded
as
a
favour
that
he
should
be
beheaded
eight
executioners
of
various
towns
presented
themselves
to
execute
the
sentence
the
one
belonging
to
colmar
who
was
accounted
the
most
expert
was
preferred
before
conducting
him
to
the
scaffold
the
sixteen
knights
who
acted
as
judges
required
that
messire
de
hagenbach
should
be
degraded
from
the
dignity
of
knight
and
from
all
his
honours
then
advanced
gaspar
hurter
herald
of
the
emperor
and
said
de
hagenbach
i
deeply
deplore
that
you
have
so
employed
your
mortal
life
that
you
must
lose
not
only
the
dignity
and
honour
of
knighthood
but
your
life
also
your
duty
was
to
render
justice
to
protect
the
widow
and
orphan
to
respect
women
and
maidens
to
honour
the
holy
priests
to
oppose
every
unjust
outrage
but
you
have
yourself
committed
what
you
ought
to
have
opposed
in
others
having
broken
therefore
the
oaths
which
you
have
sworn
and
having
forfeited
the
noble
order
of
knighthood
the
knights
here
present
have
enjoined
me
to
deprive
you
of
its
insignia
not
perceiving
them
on
your
person
at
this
moment
i
proclaim
you
unworthy
knight
of
george
in
whose
name
and
honour
you
were
formerly
admitted
in
the
order
of
knighthood
then
hermann
advanced
you
are
degraded
from
knighthood
i
deprive
you
of
your
collar
gold
chain
ring
poniard
spur
and
gauntlet
he
then
took
them
from
him
and
striking
him
on
the
face
added
and
you
who
aspire
to
that
honour
i
trust
this
public
punishment
will
serve
as
an
example
to
you
and
that
you
will
live
in
the
fear
of
god
nobly
and
valiantly
in
accordance
with
the
dignity
of
knighthood
and
the
honour
of
your
name
at
last
the
provost
of
einselheim
and
marshal
of
that
commission
of
judges
arose
and
addressing
himself
to
the
executioner
justice
be
done
all
the
judges
along
with
hermann
mounted
on
horseback
in
the
midst
of
them
walked
peter
de
hagenbach
between
two
priests
it
was
night
and
they
marched
by
the
light
of
torches
an
immense
crowd
pressed
around
this
sad
procession
the
prisoner
conversed
with
his
confessor
with
pious
collected
and
firm
demeanour
recommending
himself
to
the
prayers
of
the
spectators
on
arriving
at
a
meadow
without
the
gate
of
the
town
he
mounted
the
scaffold
with
a
firm
step
and
elevating
his
voice
exclaimed
fear
not
death
i
have
always
expected
it
not
indeed
in
this
manner
but
with
arms
in
my
hand
i
regret
alone
the
blood
which
mine
will
cause
to
be
shed
my
lord
will
not
permit
this
day
to
pass
unavenged
i
regret
neither
my
life
nor
body
i
was
a
man
pray
for
me
he
conversed
an
instant
more

his
confessor
presented
his
